WEBVTT

00:07.721 --> 00:11.851
Peanut, peanut,
peanut butter, motherfucker

00:11.892 --> 00:14.952
Tune in, dick,
you mess around with me

00:14.995 --> 00:17.691
You'll get your ass kicked

00:17.731 --> 00:20.495
'Cause you're a big motherfucker

00:20.534 --> 00:24.436
Gary has a pussy and

00:24.471 --> 00:28.407
James has a pussy and

00:28.442 --> 00:30.637
James has a pussy

00:30.677 --> 00:33.840
And Mommy has a pussy

00:33.880 --> 00:40.046
And Aunt Lil
has a little, tiny pussy

00:40.087 --> 00:41.816
Xenia, Ohio.

00:45.859 --> 00:48.157
A few years ago...

00:48.195 --> 00:51.221
a tornado hit this place.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.766
It killed the people,
left and right.

01:00.807 --> 01:04.299
Dogs died. Cats died.

01:04.343 --> 01:06.039
Houses were split open...

01:06.079 --> 01:09.640
and you could see necklaces
hanging from branches of trees.

01:12.419 --> 01:15.115
People's legs and neck bones
were sticking out.

01:16.189 --> 01:19.420
Oliver found a leg on his roof.

01:19.459 --> 01:21.723
A lot of people's fathers
died...

01:21.762 --> 01:24.560
and were killed
by the great tornado.

01:24.598 --> 01:27.726
I saw a girl
fly through the sky...

01:27.768 --> 01:29.736
and I looked up her skirt.

01:29.770 --> 01:33.297
Her skull was smashed.
And some kids died.

01:33.340 --> 01:36.207
My neighbor was killed
in that house.

01:36.243 --> 01:39.269
He used to ride dirt bikes
and three-wheelers.

01:39.312 --> 01:41.940
They never found his head.

01:41.982 --> 01:43.813
I always thought that was funny.

01:47.921 --> 01:50.389
People died in Xenia.

01:52.325 --> 01:54.293
Before dad died...

01:54.327 --> 01:57.319
he had a bad case
of the diabetes.

02:11.711 --> 02:15.147
I love my little rooster,
and my rooster loves me

02:15.182 --> 02:18.515
Gonna cherish that chicken
'neath a green bay tree

02:18.552 --> 02:20.782

02:28.662 --> 02:32.189
I'm gonna cherish my hen

Little hen goes cluck cluck

02:43.710 --> 02:47.271

02:47.314 --> 02:50.545
Little hog goes mm-mm,
little hen goes cluck cluck

02:50.584 --> 02:52.552
Little rooster goes

02:52.586 --> 02:54.076

02:54.120 --> 02:57.055
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

02:57.090 --> 03:00.548
And I love my little duckling,
my duckling loves me

03:00.594 --> 03:04.189
I'll cherish my duck

03:04.231 --> 03:07.689
Little duck goes quack quack,
little hen goes cluck cluck

03:07.734 --> 03:09.895
Little pig goes mm-mm

03:09.936 --> 03:11.494
Little rooster goes

03:11.538 --> 03:13.233
Cock-a-doodle-doo

03:13.273 --> 03:16.003
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

03:16.042 --> 03:19.773
And I love my little guinea,
and my guinea loves me

03:19.813 --> 03:23.214
Gonna cherish my guinea
'neath a green bay tree

03:23.250 --> 03:26.742
Little guin' goes pot-er-rak,
little duck goes quack quack

03:26.786 --> 03:30.187
Little pig goes mm-mm,
little hen goes cluck cluck

03:30.223 --> 03:31.690
Little rooster goes

03:31.725 --> 03:33.420
Cock-a-doodle-doo

03:33.460 --> 03:36.554
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

03:36.596 --> 03:39.997
And I love my little dog,
and my doggy loves me

03:40.033 --> 03:43.400
I'm gonna cherish that dog
'neath a green bay tree

03:43.436 --> 03:46.997
Little dog goes bowwow,
little hen goes cluck cluck

03:47.040 --> 03:50.237
Little pig goes mm-mm,
little duck goes quack quack

03:50.277 --> 03:52.404
Little guinea, pot-er-rak

03:52.445 --> 03:53.742
But my rooster goes

03:53.780 --> 03:55.771
Cock-a-doodle-doo

03:55.815 --> 03:59.683
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

04:23.410 --> 04:24.672
Spit it out.

05:16.429 --> 05:18.420
You have a lump in your titty.

05:20.533 --> 05:21.727
What?

05:22.969 --> 05:24.402
You have a big old lump.

06:48.421 --> 06:49.911
Tummler sees everything.

06:50.957 --> 06:53.016
Some say he's downright evil.

06:53.059 --> 06:55.960
He's got what it takes
to be a legend.

06:55.995 --> 06:58.054
He's got a marvelous persona.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.690
You got this one?

07:06.473 --> 07:07.906
Don't kill the bitch.
It's a house cat.

07:10.777 --> 07:11.937
It's a lesbian cat.

07:13.947 --> 07:15.915
You can tell.

07:15.949 --> 07:17.109
Looks like my mom.

07:23.089 --> 07:25.057
Know what I'm doing tomorrow?

07:25.091 --> 07:26.217
What?

07:26.259 --> 07:28.454
Going to an insane asylum.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.190
Insane asylum?

07:30.230 --> 07:32.790
Gonna get me a raving beauty.

07:32.899 --> 07:35.595
Foot Foot, where you been?

07:40.673 --> 07:43.164
You smell like a dookie, girl.

07:57.056 --> 07:59.388
Talk to him in school?

07:59.425 --> 08:02.360
I don't know. Some hall.

08:02.395 --> 08:04.386
He smiled.

08:04.430 --> 08:05.988
Don't be such a puss.

08:06.032 --> 08:08.523
I try not to. I'm shy.

08:10.603 --> 08:13.401
Foot Foot, you stink a bitch.
Where'd you find her?

08:13.439 --> 08:16.408
On the porch sleeping
for three hours.

08:16.442 --> 08:18.205
How'd she get out there?

08:18.244 --> 08:21.907
- You left the window cracked.
- No.

08:21.948 --> 08:25.213
- You did.
- It was not me.

08:25.251 --> 08:26.479
You know
it's always Darby's fault.

08:26.519 --> 08:28.077
She's looking
a little impregnated.

08:28.121 --> 08:29.520
- No.
- She is.

08:29.556 --> 08:31.888
Let's flip her over
and look at her bottom part.

08:35.128 --> 08:37.596
Let me look at you, Foot Foot.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.188
Is it red?

08:39.232 --> 08:40.756
It's not any red, no.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.200
- Is it swollen?
- No.

08:43.236 --> 08:46.137
An impregnated cat is a bitch.
Like, this cat's pregnant.

08:46.172 --> 08:48.299
Yeah. It's true.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.468
- No, she's not a bitch.
- She is, too.

08:50.510 --> 08:52.478
She's gotten herself
in trouble like this.

08:52.512 --> 08:54.844
- She still has nine nips.
- Nine nips?

08:54.881 --> 08:56.610
Nine lives, too.

08:56.649 --> 08:59.345
If she is pregnant, we'll drown
the kittens in the creek.

09:01.855 --> 09:04.915
You see? Do it like this.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.823
Get it over all the pink...
around it.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.487
Do it on it real tight.

09:09.729 --> 09:11.060
That tight,
it will get infected.

09:11.097 --> 09:13.531
Don't tell me.
This is the right way.

09:13.566 --> 09:15.796
If you just do little pats,
it won't raise it.

09:15.835 --> 09:19.236
The whole point is to make it
fatter and pop it out bigger.

09:19.272 --> 09:21.706
- Tight.
- That's tight.

09:21.741 --> 09:23.504
- This gonna hurt?
- It's not gonna hurt.

09:23.543 --> 09:25.374
We're gonna do it quick.

09:25.411 --> 09:28.073
- Ready?
- Pull it, Dot, pull it!

09:28.114 --> 09:31.277
One, two, three.

09:36.155 --> 09:37.520
They look bigger.

09:37.557 --> 09:39.957
They look a little bigger.
I think they look wider.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.755
The nipple's fatter.

09:44.464 --> 09:47.126
They look redder, but I think
they look much better.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.633
Better nipple.

09:48.668 --> 09:50.101
Every day

09:50.136 --> 09:52.161
It's a-gettin' closer

09:52.205 --> 09:55.538
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

09:55.575 --> 09:57.600
Love like yours will

09:57.644 --> 10:00.238
Surely come my way

10:00.280 --> 10:02.612
A-hey a-hey-hey

10:02.649 --> 10:04.412
Every day

10:04.450 --> 10:06.179
It's a-getting closer

10:06.219 --> 10:09.882
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

10:09.923 --> 10:11.982
Love like yours will

10:12.025 --> 10:14.493
Surely come my way

10:14.527 --> 10:16.620
A-hey a-hey-hey

10:16.663 --> 10:19.791
Every day, It's a-gettin' closer

10:19.832 --> 10:22.699
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

10:22.735 --> 10:25.829
Love like yours
will surely come my way

10:25.872 --> 10:27.567
Hey-hey hey-hey-hey

10:27.607 --> 10:30.405
Love like yours

10:30.443 --> 10:33.571
Will surely come my way

10:46.259 --> 10:47.624
What do you want to do?

10:50.563 --> 10:51.996
Wanna keep lookin'?

10:56.269 --> 10:57.793
Go by Dean's place...

10:57.837 --> 10:59.327
back by the dumpsters?

11:02.809 --> 11:04.242
Then let's go get our money.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.704
Let's get some milkshakes.

11:07.747 --> 11:09.476
Milkshakes?

11:09.515 --> 11:11.380
Strawberry milkshake.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.750
If they don't have strawberry,
I'll get pineapple.

11:16.789 --> 11:18.654
Let's go get our money first.

11:22.795 --> 11:24.888
Does your mom
ever make you food?

11:24.931 --> 11:27.866
- She makes me toast.
- Is that it?

11:27.900 --> 11:30.425
She cooks me lamb chops.

11:30.470 --> 11:32.097
You ever eaten crepe suzette?

11:53.393 --> 11:56.123
Spanker had gravy on his vest...

11:56.162 --> 11:59.928
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

11:59.966 --> 12:01.456
gravy all over him...

12:01.501 --> 12:05.062
so he went to his grave
with gravy on his vest...

12:05.104 --> 12:08.665
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

12:08.708 --> 12:10.403
gravy all over him.

12:10.443 --> 12:12.001
That dirty old man.

12:20.153 --> 12:21.984
These two kids I know...

12:22.021 --> 12:24.888
these two brothers...

12:24.924 --> 12:27.825
they murdered their parents.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.728
They both claim to be raised
as Jehovah Witnesses.

12:32.865 --> 12:36.892
They came to school
in really nice shorts...

12:36.936 --> 12:41.270
and polished tennis sneakers...

12:41.307 --> 12:46.643
and their shirts were always
collared with buttons...

12:46.679 --> 12:50.115
and their hair
was always slicked back...

12:50.149 --> 12:53.607
their teeth
were always brushed...

12:53.653 --> 12:58.784
and their shirts and pants
were always ironed...

12:58.825 --> 13:01.760
and their shoes
never were scuffed up...

13:01.794 --> 13:04.422
or anything like that.

13:04.464 --> 13:08.628
They seemed to have
a wonderful life.

13:08.668 --> 13:11.694
I don't know what went wrong.

13:11.737 --> 13:14.205
Why don't you give me
them shoes?

13:14.240 --> 13:17.004
'Cause they're new,
and I don't give you new shoes.

13:17.043 --> 13:19.238
Yeah, fuck that, man.

13:19.278 --> 13:21.212
I'm keeping this shit
right here.

13:21.247 --> 13:22.908
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

13:26.919 --> 13:28.079
Pissant.

13:31.991 --> 13:34.050
- Fuck him up.
- Get off me, man.

13:38.097 --> 13:39.564
I told you
not to hit me in the face.

13:44.971 --> 13:46.529
- What's up?
- Stop that.

13:53.479 --> 13:55.071
Damn!

13:58.417 --> 13:59.975
Shit. Go, fucker.

14:06.192 --> 14:07.352
Let's go.

14:08.628 --> 14:09.993
I'm gonna fuck you up.

14:21.941 --> 14:23.909
Damn! Shit!

14:23.943 --> 14:26.468
Hit a man while he's down.

14:26.512 --> 14:28.343
Shit. All right, all right.

14:28.381 --> 14:29.712
Oh, fuckin'...

14:29.749 --> 14:32.217
Shit, man. Give me them shoes.

14:34.153 --> 14:36.519
So, what's for dinner, man?
You cooking tonight?

14:36.656 --> 14:40.092
I was about four years old
the first time...

14:40.126 --> 14:42.026
and...

14:42.061 --> 14:45.690
I remember one time he came home
from work real late...

14:45.731 --> 14:47.426
and I had been sleeping
on the couch...

14:47.466 --> 14:50.401
and he came in,
and he woke me up...

14:50.436 --> 14:52.336
and he laid on top of me...

14:52.371 --> 14:55.363
and he told me, he said,
"Take off your panties."

14:55.408 --> 14:57.467
And I asked him why.

14:57.510 --> 15:00.070
He said
that he was only playing...

15:00.112 --> 15:02.080
and that
he wasn't gonna hurt me...

15:02.114 --> 15:05.311
and he was gonna
make me feel good.

15:05.351 --> 15:08.218
And I took off my panties,
and then...

15:08.254 --> 15:10.484
he got on top of me...

15:10.523 --> 15:16.291
and he was rubbin' and touchin'
and feelin' and laughin'.

15:16.329 --> 15:17.853
And then... and then...

15:17.897 --> 15:20.889
he'd wake up in the morning,
and he'd come in my bedroom...

15:20.933 --> 15:22.400
or bring me into his bedroom...

15:22.435 --> 15:25.871
and he would kiss me
and touch me and...

15:25.905 --> 15:28.203
and make me play with him and...

15:28.241 --> 15:31.108
And, you know, at first,
I was real scared.

15:31.143 --> 15:32.405
I didn't know if it was right...

15:32.445 --> 15:35.903
but he would tell me
that we were having fun...

15:35.948 --> 15:38.815
and what we were doing
wasn't wrong...

15:38.851 --> 15:40.512
because he was my dad.

15:53.532 --> 15:55.659
You guys didn't get very many
this time.

15:55.701 --> 15:58.135
Yeah. It's a scarce count.

15:58.170 --> 16:01.264
Let's see.
Twelve, twelve and a half.

16:01.307 --> 16:02.706
I'll give you thirteen.

16:04.043 --> 16:07.069
It's gettin' crazy, 'cause
things are startin' to thin out.

16:11.517 --> 16:13.747
You know you guys
got some competition out there?

16:13.786 --> 16:15.811
- What? Who?
- Jarrod.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.152
- Who?
- Jarrod Wiggley.

16:17.189 --> 16:18.713
You know the kid
that lives over by the school?

16:18.758 --> 16:21.090
The one who takes care
of his grandmother?

16:21.127 --> 16:23.755
I know that kid. He used to have
a sister in my class...

16:23.796 --> 16:25.093
but she moved.

16:25.131 --> 16:28.532
Her name was June Wiggley.
We used to call her June bug.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.159
And I noticed something else.

16:30.202 --> 16:32.261
The cats that's usually
out by the garbage cans...

16:32.305 --> 16:33.795
they're not around any more.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.101
And the Chinese restaurant...

16:35.141 --> 16:37.006
you know the one
that buys all my stuff?

16:37.043 --> 16:39.204
The guy that owns it
had a heart attack and died...

16:39.245 --> 16:41.179
so I guess they're getting ready
to go out of business.

16:41.213 --> 16:43.306
I'm pretty smart,
if I say so myself.

16:43.349 --> 16:44.714
Why is that?

16:44.750 --> 16:49.483
This afternoon,
we walked into a fruit store...

16:49.522 --> 16:52.650
and the clerk thought
I was some out-of-town hick.

16:52.692 --> 16:55.684
"Those apples will be
two bucks each, " he tells me.

16:55.728 --> 16:58.925
That's where I outsmarted him.
I hand over a five...

16:58.964 --> 17:01.330
And as he's about to give me
a dollar change, I say...

17:01.367 --> 17:03.164
"Keep it. We're even."

17:03.202 --> 17:06.000
"On the way in,
I stepped on a grape."

17:06.038 --> 17:08.063
You want this
by the cat or by the pound?

17:08.107 --> 17:09.300
Don't matter.

17:09.342 --> 17:11.173
I'll give you
a dollar a pound, then.

17:15.381 --> 17:17.473
Hey...

17:17.516 --> 17:19.176
could you hook me up
with some glue?

17:19.218 --> 17:20.708
What kind you want?

17:20.752 --> 17:22.617
Not wood glue.

17:22.655 --> 17:25.021
Not cement glue, either.

17:25.057 --> 17:28.220
Do you have butcher's
model glue, in tins?

17:28.260 --> 17:30.524
Yeah. I'm gonna go get it, man.

17:30.663 --> 17:33.496
Who was it?
Who killed that little baby cat?

17:33.532 --> 17:35.329
- Joseph.
- Was it?

17:35.368 --> 17:37.996
Yeah. It was ate up
with maggots, though.

17:38.037 --> 17:40.904
They had to kill it.
They're just strays.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.738
All these cats around here
have twenty babies.

17:43.776 --> 17:45.676
Little bitty old black cat.
He wasn't about this long.

17:45.711 --> 17:48.339
We was trying to figure out
how to make it stay away.

17:48.381 --> 17:50.872
Couldn't do it. He said,
"Give me a bottle of gasoline."

17:50.916 --> 17:54.249
He opened its mouth up
and poured it full of gasoline.

17:54.286 --> 17:57.346
Get that son of a bitch. I ain't
never seen that cat since.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.984
Lit it. Poured gas down it.

18:00.025 --> 18:03.392
Poured gas down it, man,
and lit it.

18:03.429 --> 18:04.953
I ain't never killed nothin'...

18:06.732 --> 18:10.031
just to be killing it,
besides that cat.

18:10.069 --> 18:12.697
He lit a cat on fire
for six hours.

18:12.738 --> 18:14.638
Boom! Boom!

18:14.673 --> 18:18.006
No, I seen somebody put one
in a microwave.

18:18.043 --> 18:19.977
That motherfucker melted.

18:20.012 --> 18:22.913
They got me for a damn BB gun.

18:22.948 --> 18:24.643
You shouldn't have pulled it
on that girl.

18:24.683 --> 18:28.414
I didn't pull it on that girl.
You're crazy!

18:28.454 --> 18:31.446
You're crazy, man.
You're crazy, man.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.014
I didn't pull that BB gun out.

18:33.058 --> 18:35.686
When I went to jail, they put us
in the old juvenile...

18:35.728 --> 18:37.457
because the jails were so full.

18:37.496 --> 18:38.895
It was one little room...

18:38.931 --> 18:42.924
with a big old silver hard bed
on a brick wall.

18:42.968 --> 18:46.404
There was eighty-five people
in the same cell with us.

18:46.439 --> 18:49.431
Worst thing I hate about it
was them niggers down there.

18:49.475 --> 18:52.239
I... God, boy, hey...

18:52.278 --> 18:54.906
They make me so mad, I just want
to tear their head off.

18:54.947 --> 18:56.539
I hate the motherfuckers.

18:57.616 --> 19:01.450
I just don't like 'em.

19:01.487 --> 19:04.718
You got them all. If you
hit one, you get them all.

19:04.757 --> 19:06.622
They have ten
to every one of you.

19:06.659 --> 19:09.492
- They ain't gonna fight fair.
- Unless you got nigger buddies.

19:09.528 --> 19:13.487
That's it. If you got
some good Latin buddies...

19:13.532 --> 19:16.729
I had some good... some good
nigger friends at Pearl.

20:08.454 --> 20:10.422
Solomon...

20:10.456 --> 20:12.822
did your mom find a new house?

20:16.795 --> 20:19.320
I saw a house yesterday...

20:19.365 --> 20:20.730
near my house.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.458
I think it was this lady's.

20:26.071 --> 20:29.370
I saw a sign, "for sale."

20:29.408 --> 20:32.468
It had a bullet hole
in the mailbox.

20:32.511 --> 20:34.138
A hole?

20:34.179 --> 20:35.771
A big old hole.

20:39.552 --> 20:42.544
I think my brother shot it down
when I was younger.

20:43.856 --> 20:46.381
I think it was him.

20:46.425 --> 20:48.290
He always used to say...

20:48.327 --> 20:51.660
Roy Orbison
liked to shoot at things.

20:51.697 --> 20:55.155
Roy always wore
these dark sunglasses.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.694
My brother always wore
the same kind of sunglasses.

20:59.738 --> 21:02.468
He sang that song "Crying."
You know that song?

21:02.508 --> 21:04.066
What?

21:04.109 --> 21:06.134
That song "Crying."

21:07.346 --> 21:09.576
Cryin'

21:09.615 --> 21:11.344
Over you

21:12.384 --> 21:14.852
Cryin'

21:14.887 --> 21:16.912
Over you

21:19.391 --> 21:22.918
My brother
used to sing "Crying."

21:22.962 --> 21:25.021
Where is he now?

21:25.064 --> 21:26.224
My brother?

21:29.134 --> 21:31.534
He's in the big city.

21:31.570 --> 21:33.060
He took off in a bus.

21:37.009 --> 21:39.603
He was a queer.

21:39.645 --> 21:40.805
He's a queer now.

21:42.548 --> 21:44.072
Your brother is?

21:45.250 --> 21:48.811
Yeah. He dressed like ladies.

21:48.854 --> 21:51.687
He wore skirts and lipsticks.

21:52.725 --> 21:55.421
He wore stockings, eyeliner.

21:55.461 --> 21:58.430
He even has boobs.

22:07.473 --> 22:09.498
Girl?

22:09.541 --> 22:11.736
Pretty much.

22:11.777 --> 22:13.404
Was he pretty?

22:14.480 --> 22:17.574
I don't know. I guess so.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.641
I guess he was pretty.

22:22.087 --> 22:24.180
Pretty enough
to have a boyfriend.

22:32.698 --> 22:35.292
Cops
will frickin' catch your ass.

22:35.334 --> 22:36.858
Fuck the cops!

22:36.902 --> 22:39.894
I know, man.
Cops can kiss my ass.

22:41.106 --> 22:42.596
All they are is assholes.

22:42.641 --> 22:45.303
I know, man.
What's the matter with them?

22:45.344 --> 22:48.211
They mad 'cause
we get more pussy than they do?

22:51.517 --> 22:54.918
Damn you, rabbit!
You smell like fuckin' piss!

22:54.953 --> 22:57.148
You can kiss my ass!

22:59.358 --> 23:01.383
I hate the goddamned rabbit.

23:01.427 --> 23:03.895
Fuckin' rabbit!

23:03.929 --> 23:05.362
Kill his ass!

23:07.800 --> 23:10.268
I don't like rabbits
comin' to my fuckin' house.

23:10.302 --> 23:11.929
I kill them.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.167
I got 'im.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.041
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

23:19.078 --> 23:22.104
He looks like a queer rabbit!
All queer!

23:22.147 --> 23:25.947
That fag! He can kiss my ass!

23:25.984 --> 23:28.452
Rabbits are queers!

23:28.487 --> 23:32.355
They always got to shit
on themselves!

23:32.391 --> 23:36.122
Those little queer-ass rabbits.

23:36.161 --> 23:39.460
Hey, look at these little fag
bunny ears.

23:39.498 --> 23:42.661
Fuckin' rabbit.
I'm sick and tired of it.

23:42.701 --> 23:45.568
- This shitty-ass rabbit stinks!
- I know.

23:45.604 --> 23:47.936
He smells like pussy!

23:47.973 --> 23:49.964
He smells like an asshole!

23:50.008 --> 23:52.135
Hey, motherfucker!

23:52.177 --> 23:54.338
Smells like wetback dick!

23:54.379 --> 23:58.475
They smell like
a pound of bullshit!

24:00.719 --> 24:02.414
Is it dead?

24:02.454 --> 24:04.684
I don't know,
but I'm gonna make sure.

24:10.229 --> 24:13.096
- I wonder if he's dead.
- Got some big-ass nostrils.

24:14.133 --> 24:17.034
Hate fuckin' rabbits.

24:23.175 --> 24:25.541
I wonder if he's got any money.

24:25.577 --> 24:27.568
Check his pockets.

24:35.621 --> 24:38.419
Don't even got
that much meat on him.

24:40.359 --> 24:42.520
Got too much grease on my gun.

24:43.462 --> 24:46.022
- That rabbit can kiss my ass.
- Come on, let's go, man.

24:47.866 --> 24:50.835
Who gives a shit about rabbits?

24:55.274 --> 24:58.107
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

24:58.143 --> 25:00.839
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

25:00.879 --> 25:03.370
Q, R, S, T, U, V

25:03.415 --> 25:06.179
W, X, and Y and Z

25:06.218 --> 25:08.982
Now I know my ABCs

25:09.021 --> 25:11.455
Next time,
won't you sing with me?

25:11.490 --> 25:14.118
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

25:14.159 --> 25:16.650
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

25:16.695 --> 25:19.255
Q, R, S, T, U, V

25:19.298 --> 25:21.994
W, X, and Y and Z

25:29.775 --> 25:33.108
- Ellen, how you doing?
- Hey.

25:33.145 --> 25:34.669
What's up with you?

25:35.747 --> 25:36.941
You good?

25:40.452 --> 25:42.044
He got a haircut.

25:42.087 --> 25:43.611
He looks pretty.

25:45.724 --> 25:47.749
His thighs are getting stronger.

25:49.094 --> 25:51.221
Eddie!

25:54.833 --> 25:57.597
Hi, Dot. Hi, Helen.

25:57.636 --> 25:59.604
My backhand really sucks.

25:59.638 --> 26:01.799
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.001
I think your playing
looks much better.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.907
I got second
in the tournament last week.

26:05.944 --> 26:09.402
- Really?
- Yep. My serve got faster.

26:09.448 --> 26:11.109
Increased by eight percent.

26:11.149 --> 26:13.447
I can hit a ball
up to sixty-five miles an hour.

26:13.485 --> 26:15.680
You got that way
from practicin'?

26:15.721 --> 26:18.155
No. I got this thing
called A.D.D.

26:19.558 --> 26:21.526
It's an attention disorder.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.255
It affects the nervous system.

26:25.230 --> 26:27.095
Makes it hard to concentrate.

26:27.132 --> 26:28.997
Makes it hard?

26:29.034 --> 26:31.264
Makes it hard, 'cause, like...

26:31.303 --> 26:33.669
before I knew I had A.D.D...

26:33.705 --> 26:35.104
I wouldn't really
go for the ball...

26:36.008 --> 26:37.908
I wouldn't run the extra mile.

26:39.544 --> 26:42.741
Yeah, but it's hard to explain.

26:42.781 --> 26:46.649
I take ritalin,
this kind of prescription drug.

26:46.685 --> 26:49.415
It's not like a drug
that fucks you up.

26:49.454 --> 26:52.048
If anything,
it makes you normal.

26:54.226 --> 26:55.921
He just likes to go out
with skinny girls.

26:55.961 --> 26:57.724
- How do you know?
- I just know.

26:57.763 --> 26:58.923
Who told you?

26:58.964 --> 27:00.693
His last girlfriend
used to be anorexic.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.700
- Was she bulimic?
- I don't know.

27:02.734 --> 27:04.497
I'll bet
she was a bulimic puker...

27:04.536 --> 27:06.834
with white spots on her teeth.

27:06.872 --> 27:09.773
I don't know. She used to run
track after school...

27:09.808 --> 27:11.469
and this girl said,
"There goes Eddie's girl."

27:11.510 --> 27:14.240
And I thought, "What for?
That girl's so skinny."

27:14.279 --> 27:16.713
- They broke up, right?
- A while ago.

27:16.748 --> 27:19.478
- Skin and bones.
- She was so skinny...

27:19.518 --> 27:21.452
she had to wear rubber bands
around the tops of her socks...

27:21.486 --> 27:23.545
and a belt around her spandex
bike shorts to keep them up.

27:23.588 --> 27:25.647
No, she didn't.

27:25.691 --> 27:27.716
Kids in school
used to laugh so hard.

27:27.759 --> 27:29.693
Sure.

27:29.728 --> 27:32.288
It's crazy, so crazy.

27:32.331 --> 27:34.026
Guess I'm not skinny enough
for him, then.

27:34.066 --> 27:35.966
- You are.
- No.

27:36.001 --> 27:38.026
At least
if he goes out with you...

27:38.070 --> 27:39.435
you'll know he got good taste.

27:40.739 --> 27:42.866
We'll see.

27:42.908 --> 27:45.638
We'll see if it happens,
is what we'll see.

27:49.014 --> 27:52.609
I was born
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

27:52.651 --> 27:55.586
to a lesbian midwife...

27:55.620 --> 27:58.714
who cut all her hair
like a butch.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.261
And when I was little,
she used to have stre...

28:04.296 --> 28:05.786
My mom
used to have stretch marks...

28:05.831 --> 28:07.662
that went around in circles.

28:15.774 --> 28:19.938
But I used to roll marbles
on her stomach...

28:19.978 --> 28:22.708
my mom's stomach... and when
I would hit the navel...

28:22.748 --> 28:25.342
she'd give me five dollars.

28:25.384 --> 28:27.716
When I'd hit the navel,
she'd give me five dollars.

28:27.753 --> 28:29.653
When I would hit
the side of her arm...

28:29.688 --> 28:31.656
she would fuckin' hit me, man...

28:31.690 --> 28:33.988
with a... a fuckin'...

28:34.026 --> 28:36.256
a... a... a hairbrush...

28:36.294 --> 28:38.888
or she would beat me...

28:38.930 --> 28:42.764
I had a lesbian midwife
who gave birth to my mother...

28:42.801 --> 28:45.634
while I was born
through my mother's womb.

28:45.670 --> 28:47.297
My mother,
when she was thirty years old...

28:47.339 --> 28:48.465
she entered menopause.

28:48.507 --> 28:51.704
She sprouted a fuckin' mustache.
She lost her sex drive.

28:51.743 --> 28:54.541
Everything in the house
started to change.

28:54.579 --> 28:56.444
The way she would do the dishes
would change...

28:56.481 --> 28:58.745
or the way
she would clean the cabinets...

28:58.784 --> 29:00.342
out of the house would change.

29:00.385 --> 29:03.047
OK, so my sister,
she gets a complex.

29:03.088 --> 29:07.457
She starts thinking, because
my mother has menopause...

29:07.492 --> 29:10.893
at such an earlier...
at such an early age...

29:10.929 --> 29:13.397
that she's gonna lose
all her sex drive...

29:13.432 --> 29:16.799
and then her mustache is gonna
come out like my mom's mustache.

29:16.835 --> 29:18.996
I can't shoot ball
like Michael Jordan can...

29:20.072 --> 29:22.006
but that's all right, though,
you know?

29:23.308 --> 29:24.969
I'm also gay.

29:31.850 --> 29:33.681
Don't be nervous.

29:33.718 --> 29:35.242
I ain't being nervous.

29:42.461 --> 29:46.090
Now, there's something
special about you.

29:46.131 --> 29:48.565
Something special I want.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.090
Will you kiss me?

29:52.370 --> 29:53.928
You're not gay.

30:02.180 --> 30:03.579
It's all right.

30:07.119 --> 30:10.987
My mother rejected me,
my father rejected me.

30:11.022 --> 30:13.115
There was no love
in the household.

30:13.158 --> 30:15.752
I was beaten, I was abused.

30:15.794 --> 30:18.354
I had people stick shit
up my rectum.

30:18.396 --> 30:20.421
Will you hug me? Just hug me.

30:20.465 --> 30:22.456
- I'll give you a hug, man.
- Just hug me.

30:22.501 --> 30:25.436
Seriously,
just calm down, just hug me.

30:25.470 --> 30:27.301
Just give me some warmth.

30:28.507 --> 30:30.441
Just hug.

30:30.475 --> 30:34.434
Just hug me for a little bit,
because I'm so lonely.

30:34.479 --> 30:37.107
I'm so... I've got no one.

30:38.483 --> 30:41.418
There's no one left.
I've got no one left.

30:41.453 --> 30:44.081
I've got no one to love me
any more.

30:44.122 --> 30:46.784
I'll die here on this couch
with you.

30:51.329 --> 30:55.425
My father worked the late shift
as a bathroom attendant.

30:55.467 --> 30:59.699
My father was mugged
on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

30:59.738 --> 31:01.729
For the rest of his days
on earth...

31:01.773 --> 31:04.537
my father never celebrated
this holiday.

31:11.783 --> 31:14.343
- With my sister.
- With your sister?

31:14.386 --> 31:17.321
Wait till her husband finds out.

31:17.355 --> 31:19.585
Oh, shit,
don't do nothing about it.

31:19.624 --> 31:21.649
You'll come up dead,
laying in a ditch.

31:23.728 --> 31:25.559
Yeah, you did, you liar.

31:25.597 --> 31:27.565
No, I didn't. I never hit it.

31:27.599 --> 31:30.363
Well, shoot,
you never know about that.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.200
You Jarrod Wiggley?

31:38.109 --> 31:39.599
You know Huntz?

31:40.612 --> 31:43.046
He told me some stuff about you.

31:43.081 --> 31:45.311
What did he say?

31:45.350 --> 31:48.251
He said you'd been killing cats.

31:48.286 --> 31:51.380
For, like, the past three weeks.

31:53.024 --> 31:54.753
When do you go out?

31:54.793 --> 31:57.284
Do it during the day usually?

31:57.329 --> 31:59.923
No. I do it mostly at night.

32:00.966 --> 32:02.524
You shoot 'em?

32:02.567 --> 32:05.297
No. I put glass in tuna fish.

32:05.337 --> 32:09.364
But mostly, I sprinkle poison
around the dumpsters...

32:09.407 --> 32:10.931
like in the corners...

32:10.976 --> 32:14.434
or around back
behind the church over there.

32:14.479 --> 32:16.811
Huntz said
you take care of your granny.

32:16.848 --> 32:19.578
Yeah. She's sick.

32:19.618 --> 32:21.347
How old is she?

32:21.386 --> 32:26.016
She's, like, I don't know,
probably ninety or ninety-one.

32:26.057 --> 32:28.423
- Do you bathe her?
- Yeah.

32:28.460 --> 32:31.793
I have to scrub her off
with a big sponge.

32:31.830 --> 32:33.627
Do you have to change
her diaper?

32:33.665 --> 32:37.601
Yeah. I hate that shit.
I hate all that shit.

32:37.636 --> 32:39.228
Does she speak to herself?

32:39.271 --> 32:43.799
No. She don't speak any more.
She's catatonic.

32:43.842 --> 32:46.743
She used to speak to herself.
She'd watch game shows...

32:46.778 --> 32:50.077
and yell out
stuff to herself all the time.

32:50.115 --> 32:52.345
She used to throw darts, right?

32:52.384 --> 32:54.511
Yeah.
She used to have a dartboard.

32:55.387 --> 32:57.685
So now you just take care
of your granny?

32:59.624 --> 33:01.148
You kill cats, too?

33:04.362 --> 33:07.024
I'm sick of everything.

33:07.065 --> 33:11.468
I can't understand what the fuck
is wrong with people...

33:11.503 --> 33:12.765
in this world.

33:12.804 --> 33:17.241
They sit around. They don't know
what the fuck is going on.

33:17.275 --> 33:19.436
- They're stupid.
- Fuck, they're ignorant.

33:19.477 --> 33:24.141
They're... they're fuckers.
I fuckin' hate myself.

33:24.182 --> 33:26.844
They... they... they...

33:26.885 --> 33:32.084
sit there in their pretend
little lives...

33:32.123 --> 33:33.784
in their homes...

33:34.959 --> 33:37.427
Hold on. Cassidey.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.360
What's up, man?

33:46.071 --> 33:47.436
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

33:47.472 --> 33:48.962
Yeah, good.

33:49.007 --> 33:50.440
You guys ride your bikes
over here?

33:53.878 --> 33:55.778
You bring me...
You brought my money?

33:55.814 --> 33:57.611
- Yeah. Right here.
- Good.

33:57.649 --> 33:59.412
Come on, let's go in the house.
Come on.

34:02.287 --> 34:03.447
Man.

34:04.689 --> 34:07.249
I got to tell you,
she had a migraine headache...

34:07.292 --> 34:08.554
earlier today.

34:08.592 --> 34:11.289
She almost wanted to call
the whole thing off, OK?

34:11.329 --> 34:13.559
But I gave her...
I gave her some aspirin.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.233
Cool. Hey, thanks a lot.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.534
- I'm gonna go fuck her now.
- Wait. You want to fuck her?

34:25.310 --> 34:26.504
Are you gonna fuck her, too?

34:27.645 --> 34:28.873
All right, you got to hold on.

34:33.251 --> 34:35.185
Hey, Cassidey.

34:35.219 --> 34:37.051
Hey, put on that bathrobe thing.

34:38.056 --> 34:41.219
Hey, put that on.

34:41.259 --> 34:42.418
All right.

34:43.527 --> 34:44.755
She's ready.

34:48.766 --> 34:50.496
- You ready?
- Yeah.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.301
OK, you got
to keep the light on.

34:53.338 --> 34:54.498
All right.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.169
You all right?

35:39.083 --> 35:40.311
You good?

35:52.464 --> 35:53.658
You ready?

36:00.238 --> 36:01.535
All right, come on.

36:21.226 --> 36:23.319
Hi, Solly.

36:23.361 --> 36:25.158
Are you clean?

36:25.196 --> 36:27.528
Did you use soap?

36:27.565 --> 36:29.396
Let me smell your wrist.

36:32.737 --> 36:34.637
Smells good.

36:35.607 --> 36:37.939
- How does it smell like?
- Like fruit, like cherries.

36:37.976 --> 36:40.672
My mom gives me cherry shampoo.

36:44.449 --> 36:46.417
I like cherries.

36:46.451 --> 36:48.817
I put cherries on my ice cream.

36:48.853 --> 36:51.788
I like the name of cherry.
Cherries.

36:57.996 --> 37:00.123
You got hands like a girl.

37:00.164 --> 37:01.392
No, I don't.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.992
Yes, you do.

37:10.608 --> 37:12.542
Can I read your fortune?

37:14.779 --> 37:19.341
This big line says
you're gonna be a millionaire.

37:19.384 --> 37:21.318
It says your...

37:21.352 --> 37:25.379
It says your wife will die
in a hay fire.

37:25.423 --> 37:26.583
But I don't have a wife.

37:26.624 --> 37:29.149
You will,
but it ain't gonna be me.

37:50.515 --> 37:53.040
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

37:53.084 --> 37:54.483
Do you think I'm attractive?

37:54.519 --> 37:57.977
No. You look fine
the way you are... skinny.

37:58.022 --> 38:00.752
When I sit down to eat,
I get sexy!

38:00.792 --> 38:03.454
When I go to bed, I get hungry!

38:03.494 --> 38:06.952
I saw a man lying in the street,
and I said, "Can I help you?"

38:06.998 --> 38:09.626
He said, "No.
I just found a parking space."

38:09.667 --> 38:12.135
"Now I sent my wife
to go buy a car!"

38:12.170 --> 38:15.765
It's just murder what's going on
with people these days.

38:15.807 --> 38:18.469
Just the other day,
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

38:18.509 --> 38:21.501
a man walked up to me and said,
"I haven't eaten in 3 days."

38:21.546 --> 38:23.138
I said, "Force yourself!"

38:23.181 --> 38:25.877
Another man
walked up to me and said...

38:25.917 --> 38:27.043
"I haven't eaten in a week!"

38:27.085 --> 38:29.918
I said, "Don't worry.
It tastes the same!"

38:31.222 --> 38:34.282
All right! We're rolling!
I love this crowd!

39:56.407 --> 39:58.170
Peoples got to work
for a livin'.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.541
I believe in a blue-collar race.

40:00.578 --> 40:04.139
I think suicide's
the only way out... out of life.

40:05.183 --> 40:08.380
I wanted to die.
I tried to die, but I didn't.

40:10.421 --> 40:13.015
They say it's my depression,
but what the fuck, man?

40:13.057 --> 40:15.116
I don't fuckin' know any more.

40:16.194 --> 40:18.526
Which way
should I fuckin' turn, man?

40:42.620 --> 40:44.554
Shut up!

40:44.589 --> 40:46.056
- I hate that dog.
- I hate it, too.

40:46.090 --> 40:47.216
It's mean and ugly.

40:47.258 --> 40:50.159
It's got two sets of teeth,
like a shark.

40:50.194 --> 40:52.992
That's why Roy calls it Sharky.

40:53.030 --> 40:55.328
Yeah. The other day I saw it
eating a turkey bone.

40:55.366 --> 40:57.857
I swear it looked like
it was choking on the bone.

40:57.902 --> 40:59.426
I wish it would choke
and shut up.

40:59.470 --> 41:01.938
Yeah. I was gonna go tell
Miss Barry, but...

41:01.973 --> 41:03.304
After the last time?

41:03.341 --> 41:05.002
After last time, I didn't even
want to get near her front door.

41:05.042 --> 41:07.010
"You kids
get out of my front yard..."

41:07.044 --> 41:08.341
"or I'm calling the police!"

41:08.379 --> 41:10.973
- You want sparkles?
- Hell, no.

41:11.015 --> 41:12.607
You don't want sparkles?

41:12.650 --> 41:15.813
I want sparkles, Darb.
You can do my toes.

41:15.853 --> 41:17.980
OK. When I'm done with hers.

41:18.022 --> 41:19.250
Don't rush her.

41:22.126 --> 41:23.787
You're getting better, Darb.

41:35.273 --> 41:39.539
This woman and this man,
they was married.

41:39.577 --> 41:44.537
Was real good friends
until another woman came along.

41:44.582 --> 41:46.948
Now they're lesbians.

41:46.984 --> 41:49.612
Disgusting... two women
biting at each other...

41:49.654 --> 41:51.349
if you get my drift.

41:51.389 --> 41:53.186
I think that... that's nasty.

41:54.325 --> 41:56.088
Man, I get the chills.

41:56.127 --> 41:58.152
I'm a party boy.

41:58.196 --> 41:59.663
Not only that...

41:59.697 --> 42:03.030
you'll be... be pickin' up
women in your pickup, man.

42:03.067 --> 42:05.900
Yeah. My pickup, man. Yeah.

42:05.937 --> 42:08.030
That's the way I am.

42:08.072 --> 42:10.939
Turn fifteen, I'm partyin'.

42:12.743 --> 42:15.712
Without wood,
there'd be no America.

42:15.746 --> 42:18.806
No ships to bring the pilgrims
across the ocean.

42:18.850 --> 42:22.786
No log cabins,
no schoolhouses...

42:22.820 --> 42:26.051
no churches,
no covered wagons...

42:26.090 --> 42:29.082
no rail road ties...

42:29.126 --> 42:31.321
no cigar store indians...

42:31.362 --> 42:32.795
no nothin'.

43:32.657 --> 43:34.386
Solomon, are you down there?

43:38.195 --> 43:39.822
What are you doing
lifting weights?

43:39.864 --> 43:42.424
- I'm lifting.
- You'll stunt your growth.

43:42.466 --> 43:44.093
You're gonna get
peg leg shoulders...

43:44.135 --> 43:46.103
and pinched neck nerves.

43:46.137 --> 43:48.196
It's not good to lift
while you're growing.

43:48.239 --> 43:49.797
I can see your shoulder
popping out.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.831
Look at the way
it raises and gets smaller...

43:51.876 --> 43:53.639
raises and gets smaller.

43:54.979 --> 43:57.243
You're gonna pop out a joint.
That's not healthy.

43:57.281 --> 43:59.181
Look at it. It's gonna pop.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.323
Your dad's old taps.

44:11.362 --> 44:12.829
He used to be good.

44:14.432 --> 44:17.265
He said he was blessed
with the gift of tap.

44:17.301 --> 44:19.599
Took up tapping
when he got his bald spot.

44:21.038 --> 44:22.300
He wanted to get transplants...

44:22.340 --> 44:24.467
but I thought
that was a bit drastic.

44:25.543 --> 44:28.569
Told him if he wanted to,
he should take up tap.

44:30.448 --> 44:31.608
He put up the mirror.

44:33.417 --> 44:36.147
He said if Marlene Dietrich
could see him dance...

44:36.187 --> 44:37.745
she would fall in love.

44:37.788 --> 44:40.154
What do you want
with Marlene Dietrich?

44:41.359 --> 44:43.884
She had her bottom ribs
surgically removed...

44:43.928 --> 44:46.658
so she'd have
more of an hourglass figure.

44:46.697 --> 44:48.597
Don't you know stars are flawed?

44:54.739 --> 44:56.900
Will you smile?

44:56.941 --> 44:59.205
Come on, I want a smile.

44:59.243 --> 45:00.608
Tuck in that tummy.

45:00.644 --> 45:02.111
One smile. Come on.

45:02.146 --> 45:04.273
I'm gonna tickle you
till you smile.

45:04.315 --> 45:05.782
Flatten that tummy.

45:05.816 --> 45:07.647
Hold your shoulders in.

45:08.953 --> 45:11.615
Do you miss your dad? I do.

45:11.655 --> 45:13.885
Come on, hold that tummy in.

45:13.924 --> 45:16.051
Come on,
can you smile for me, please?

45:19.363 --> 45:20.694
OK, you son of a bitch...

45:20.731 --> 45:23.256
if you don't smile,
I'm gonna kill you, OK?

45:23.300 --> 45:25.791
I've killed before,
and I will kill again.

45:25.836 --> 45:29.499
I will pick up your brains
all over the floor.

45:29.540 --> 45:31.007
You came out of my womb...

45:31.042 --> 45:33.135
and I'll stick you
right back in my womb.

45:33.177 --> 45:36.271
If you don't smile,
I'm going to kill you.

45:53.330 --> 45:55.525
Yeah, party.

45:57.201 --> 45:58.361
Break dance.

46:15.619 --> 46:18.247
I have a good personality.

46:18.289 --> 46:22.191
I have blond hair, blue eyes.

46:22.226 --> 46:25.957
I'm a hundred
and thirty-five pounds...

46:25.996 --> 46:29.022
and I'm 4' 101/2.

46:29.066 --> 46:31.125
I have very light skin.

46:31.168 --> 46:35.537
I am considered
what you would call an albino.

46:35.573 --> 46:39.805
I like men
that are very sensitive...

46:39.844 --> 46:45.146
that will sit down and watch
a good movie with me...

46:45.182 --> 46:47.082
won't hit on me...

46:47.118 --> 46:48.745
will love me for me.

46:48.786 --> 46:54.156
I like men that either have
blond hair, blue eyes...

46:54.191 --> 46:56.056
or...

46:56.093 --> 46:58.118
black or brown hair.

46:58.162 --> 47:01.563
Actually, the eyes,
it really doesn't matter.

47:01.599 --> 47:04.067
My favorite movie stars are...

47:04.101 --> 47:08.231
Pamela Anderson
and Patrick Swayze.

47:08.272 --> 47:10.832
Patrick Swayze is sexy.

47:10.875 --> 47:12.467
He's good-lookin'.

47:12.510 --> 47:14.375
I love that man to death.

47:15.813 --> 47:19.943
I would pay money to touch him.

47:21.418 --> 47:22.680
When I was born...

47:22.720 --> 47:26.486
I was born without any toes
on my feet at all.

47:26.524 --> 47:29.493
I would pick things up
with the balls of my feet...

47:29.527 --> 47:31.188
instead of my toes.

47:31.228 --> 47:34.595
I had trouble
walking on my feet.

47:48.045 --> 47:50.980
Clifford Dumkin
is the fat cocaine addict...

47:51.015 --> 47:53.677
who lives down by my house.

47:53.717 --> 47:57.778
He's into wife-swapping
and sex parties.

47:58.722 --> 48:01.748
He gives girls cocaine,
and he fucks them...

48:01.792 --> 48:04.761
in front of different kids
in the neighborhood.

48:04.795 --> 48:06.956
Every time I see him...

48:06.997 --> 48:09.795
he's got cocaine
all over his mustache.

48:15.439 --> 48:18.340
- Watch her eyes.
- I want a mustache, damn it!

48:18.375 --> 48:20.400
- Get her underbelly.
- Her underbooty.

48:22.413 --> 48:24.847
- Get her nipples.
- I want a mustache!

48:24.882 --> 48:26.042
It's OK, Foot Foot.

48:26.083 --> 48:28.415
I want to look like
Burt Reynolds!

48:32.990 --> 48:35.823
I want a mustache, damn it!

48:38.329 --> 48:40.524
Oh, baby, it's OK.

48:43.334 --> 48:46.326
- Gotta calm down.
- I want a mustache, damn it!

49:22.273 --> 49:23.831
Get down!

49:32.349 --> 49:34.408
No! Get down now!

49:54.038 --> 49:55.869
Do you still miss her?

49:56.874 --> 49:59.206
Yeah. There's not a day goes by
that I don't miss her.

50:01.545 --> 50:03.877
Sure seems that way sometimes.

50:03.914 --> 50:06.974
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

50:08.519 --> 50:11.079
Do you think
she looked a little like me?

50:11.121 --> 50:13.112
Yeah, she looked
a little bit like you.

50:15.492 --> 50:17.221
She's in heaven now.

50:17.261 --> 50:18.956
Yeah, she's in heaven now.

50:22.333 --> 50:23.925
What was she like?

50:25.703 --> 50:27.694
Oh, she's... Brown hair.

50:27.738 --> 50:30.605
She drinked, you know,
a little bit...

50:30.641 --> 50:32.700
but she was a good person.

50:32.743 --> 50:36.406
She was real nice, she was.

50:36.447 --> 50:38.472
When I was a kid,
I remember growin' up.

50:39.583 --> 50:41.073
There was this man
that raised me.

50:41.118 --> 50:43.951
His wife walked around
in her underclothes...

50:43.987 --> 50:46.854
and he'd always tell us...

50:46.890 --> 50:48.289
all us boys
that worked for him...

50:48.325 --> 50:49.690
you know, when you'd come in...

50:49.727 --> 50:51.524
she'd be walking around
getting ready for work...

50:51.562 --> 50:53.894
told us not to bug her.

50:53.931 --> 50:56.399
They always warned us,
you know, don't...

50:56.433 --> 50:59.061
you can look, but don't touch.

50:59.103 --> 51:01.003
It was hard to do...

51:01.038 --> 51:03.165
when there was something
tempting in front of you...

51:03.207 --> 51:06.370
as pretty and good-lookin'
as she was...

51:06.410 --> 51:08.207
you know and everything.

51:08.245 --> 51:11.237
But you got to respect
somebody else's wife...

51:11.281 --> 51:12.873
in other words.

51:26.830 --> 51:28.730
His dad never gave a crap.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.868
Not even at the end of his game.

51:32.903 --> 51:35.667
It was scary to see him
despondent like that.

51:36.974 --> 51:40.068
His dad didn't care
for mom much, either...

51:40.110 --> 51:41.600
or the little doggie.

51:42.713 --> 51:44.374
He started going to church...

51:45.516 --> 51:48.144
and he started listening
to the gospels.

51:49.420 --> 51:52.617
It was expected
when he robbed the neighbors.

51:52.656 --> 51:54.123
He took their wine...

51:54.158 --> 51:57.059
and he took
some rings and fine jewelry.

51:58.228 --> 51:59.957
I think he got a fur coat
as well.

52:01.031 --> 52:03.090
When he had a kid...

52:03.133 --> 52:06.102
he didn't think
to watch his ways.

52:06.136 --> 52:07.797
He felt the same as his daddy.

52:12.075 --> 52:14.339
Come on, put it back up.

52:14.378 --> 52:16.471
- Let's go!
- Come on, man!

52:16.513 --> 52:19.107
Go! Go, God damn it!

52:19.149 --> 52:21.140
- Fuckin' get it!
- Put it up!

52:23.654 --> 52:25.519
- Let's go.
- Tell me when you're ready.

52:25.556 --> 52:27.251
Get that motherfucker.

52:27.291 --> 52:29.851
On your marks, set, go.

52:29.893 --> 52:31.861
Get him, God damn it, go!

52:31.895 --> 52:33.920
Fuck him up, Tummy!

52:33.964 --> 52:36.592
Get it, boy! Get it, goddamn!

52:36.633 --> 52:38.692
Don't be afeared!

52:45.209 --> 52:47.404
- Got beat, didn't ya?
- Hell, yeah!

52:47.444 --> 52:48.706
Shit!

52:50.481 --> 52:52.881
Don't you know it's a sin
to get beat by your son?

52:52.916 --> 52:54.781
Shoop, shoop, shoop

52:54.818 --> 52:56.843
He got beat, he got beat

52:56.887 --> 52:59.185
He got beat by his own son

52:59.223 --> 53:00.986
He got beat, he got beat

53:01.024 --> 53:03.219
He got beat by his own son

53:03.260 --> 53:04.784
He got beat, he got beat

53:04.828 --> 53:06.489
He got beat by Tummy

53:06.530 --> 53:09.158
He got beat,
he got beat by mummy

53:23.881 --> 53:26.645
- Who's next?
- Who's next?

53:26.683 --> 53:27.877
How about the girls?

53:29.887 --> 53:32.219
You two wrestle...
have an arm wrestle.

53:33.857 --> 53:36.826
- Come on. Get it goin'.
- Get it on!

53:38.161 --> 53:42.564
Let's see what we got.
You sit there and there.

53:42.599 --> 53:44.032
All right, let's see it.

53:45.702 --> 53:47.897
Do they even know
how to arm wrestle?

53:47.938 --> 53:50.168
Now, are you guys ready?
You guys ready?

53:50.207 --> 53:51.572
On your mark...

53:51.608 --> 53:54.975
No holdin' the table.

53:55.012 --> 53:57.071
Hand up in the air.

53:57.114 --> 53:59.105
Get steady...

53:59.149 --> 54:00.980
- Are you ready?
- No, not really.

54:01.018 --> 54:03.077
You ready?

54:03.120 --> 54:04.519
- Ready.
- You ready?

54:05.722 --> 54:07.246
Go!

54:07.291 --> 54:10.089
- Come on!
- Come on!

54:10.127 --> 54:14.154
Go, God damn it! Yeah!

54:14.197 --> 54:15.357
There.

54:18.035 --> 54:22.165
God! Get beat like that,
that's awful.

54:22.205 --> 54:23.729
It's all right. It's all right.

54:23.774 --> 54:25.833
- I take pride...
- I tried.

54:25.876 --> 54:28.868
She did her bit. She tried.

54:28.912 --> 54:30.504
You gave it all.

54:30.547 --> 54:32.344
Any more fucking beer?

54:32.382 --> 54:33.872
- That's it.
- Fuck.

54:33.917 --> 54:35.748
Man, fuck all this bullshit.

54:35.786 --> 54:38.277
I can piss in this bottle,
fill it back up.

54:38.322 --> 54:40.347
- Fuck that.
- Have to go for a beer run.

54:40.390 --> 54:46.386
- Who's next?
- The big man, little man!

54:46.430 --> 54:48.557
Let's get it. Come on.

54:48.599 --> 54:50.430
That's what I want to see.

54:50.467 --> 54:52.025
Let's go, buddy.

54:52.069 --> 54:55.232
Show him what you got, man.
Fuck him up.

54:55.272 --> 54:57.604
- Come on!
- Ready?

54:57.641 --> 54:58.835
Go!

54:58.875 --> 55:00.900
Come on! Get it! Get it!

55:00.944 --> 55:03.105
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

55:03.146 --> 55:05.944
You got it! Come on! Get him!

55:07.250 --> 55:09.343
Fuck this shit!

55:10.487 --> 55:11.681
Damn!

55:13.690 --> 55:15.749
Fuck this shit, man!

55:19.062 --> 55:20.654
Did the little man get you,
buddy?

55:20.697 --> 55:23.393
- Motherfucker.
- You should be ashamed.

55:23.433 --> 55:25.993
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

55:27.504 --> 55:28.801
Loser.

55:28.839 --> 55:31.103
You can lose with pride,
though, man, shit.

55:32.909 --> 55:37.209
Little fuck
can break our assholes anyway.

55:37.247 --> 55:39.374
Not true, motherfucker.

55:46.156 --> 55:49.057
Aren't you a little girly
from Salt Lake City?

55:50.160 --> 55:52.253
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

55:52.295 --> 55:54.661
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties...

55:54.698 --> 55:56.791
She loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

55:56.833 --> 55:59.563
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.738
That little girl
from Salt Lake City...

56:05.776 --> 56:07.937
two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

56:07.978 --> 56:09.809
Loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

56:09.846 --> 56:12.314
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

56:21.758 --> 56:23.225
Get in there!

56:23.260 --> 56:25.592
Don't let him get on you, man!

56:25.629 --> 56:28.063
Get him out! Come on!

56:30.300 --> 56:32.200
Come on, man, get him down!

56:35.939 --> 56:38.066
Fuck him up! Come on!

56:38.108 --> 56:39.973
Get him!

56:40.010 --> 56:42.911
Come on! Don't let him
fuck with you like that!

56:42.946 --> 56:45.813
He ain't got no damn business
fucking with you.

56:45.849 --> 56:48.977
- Goddamn!
- Kill him!

56:49.019 --> 56:51.749
Break him down!

56:51.788 --> 56:53.949
Get him down and beat
the fucking hell out of him!

56:53.990 --> 56:55.548
- Come on!
- Stomp his head!

56:55.592 --> 56:59.289
- Stomp his ass!
- Hit him one more time.

57:01.898 --> 57:04.423
- Fuck him up.
- Get him!

57:14.778 --> 57:16.473
There you go!

57:16.513 --> 57:19.482
Goddamn,
dig his fucking grave, man!

57:19.516 --> 57:20.710
Come on!

57:25.589 --> 57:26.783
Teach that motherfucker.

57:28.091 --> 57:29.615
There you go!

57:31.228 --> 57:32.593
Hit him in the head!

57:32.629 --> 57:33.823
Smash his brains!

57:35.899 --> 57:37.491
Look at that.

57:41.004 --> 57:45.771
- Ain't no ambulance.
- Oh, well.

57:45.809 --> 57:46.969
Spit on him.

57:48.645 --> 57:50.704
Life's a bitch,
and then you die.

57:50.747 --> 57:52.009
There you go.

58:57.113 --> 58:58.478
It's a cat trap.

59:00.584 --> 59:02.882
I want it high.

01:00:35.612 --> 01:00:38.137
The doctor said they're
gonna have to take off...

01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:39.808
one of my boobies...

01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:43.551
and I know what happens
when they do that.

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:47.080
Boys'll stop looking at me...

01:00:48.391 --> 01:00:52.452
and once,
when I finally meet a guy...

01:00:52.495 --> 01:00:55.521
that likes me,
and he sees my scar...

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.728
he'll just stop talking to me
for no reason.

01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:04.004
Boys are like that.

01:01:08.979 --> 01:01:11.004
Dear world...

01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:15.074
I have confusion around me in
every direction from my brain.

01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:19.680
I've tried and tried to make it
here in this fucking world...

01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:22.817
but I think it was a mistake
that I was ever born.

01:01:22.859 --> 01:01:25.953
I do not feel guilty
about taking my own life.

01:01:25.996 --> 01:01:28.624
I've tried your ways.

01:01:28.665 --> 01:01:33.261
I've had a job
since I was thirteen years old.

01:01:33.303 --> 01:01:37.034
Making a living
was never a real problem for me.

01:01:38.508 --> 01:01:42.604
The problem was all I see
is misery and darkness.

01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:44.670
Die, die, die.

01:01:44.714 --> 01:01:46.648
I'll put a gun
to my fucking head right now.

01:02:01.765 --> 01:02:04.757
I'm so pissed I could kill you,
but I'm not going to.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.101
Life is beautiful.

01:02:09.139 --> 01:02:11.130
Really it is.

01:02:11.174 --> 01:02:13.699
Full of beauty and illusions.

01:02:14.844 --> 01:02:16.311
Life is great.

01:02:16.346 --> 01:02:19.474
Without it, you'd be dead.

01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:21.211
I think one of the reasons
she didn't struggle so much...

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:22.878
is I said,
"You're a black witch."

01:02:22.919 --> 01:02:24.284
"We're giving you
the greatest honor..."

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.812
"to sit at the right hand
of Arioch in hell."

01:03:05.728 --> 01:03:07.218
Jarrod ain't here.

01:05:03.546 --> 01:05:04.706
Go like that.

01:05:25.435 --> 01:05:27.562
He's got a gay one.

01:05:27.604 --> 01:05:29.094
Come on.

01:05:56.299 --> 01:05:57.857
Is she dead?

01:06:04.407 --> 01:06:06.739
She's alive on that machine.

01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:10.708
She stinks.

01:06:16.386 --> 01:06:17.853
Her life is over.

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:21.081
She smells like baked ham.

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:26.353
Bet she could live like this
forever.

01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:30.727
Do you think
she'll ever wake up?

01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:34.031
Hell, no.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.230
She's dead as hell.

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:39.106
Go over and shoot her
in the foot.

01:06:41.577 --> 01:06:42.737
Why?

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.471
Try and wake her up.
Shoot her in the foot.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.635
I told you she's dead.

01:07:17.347 --> 01:07:19.941
Could live forever
on one of these gadgets.

01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:30.515
She'll be dead now.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.099
She's always been dead.

01:07:45.108 --> 01:07:47.303
She's been gone a long time.

01:07:49.345 --> 01:07:50.835
She sure stinks.

01:08:00.022 --> 01:08:03.423
French fries, sittin' on a bench

01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:07.452
May I, want I, fifteen cents

01:08:07.497 --> 01:08:09.658
You miss, you miss

01:08:09.699 --> 01:08:11.360
You miss like this

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.975
This is my baby...

01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:21.533
and I breast-feed it.

01:08:33.956 --> 01:08:36.720
I'm its mother.

01:08:40.196 --> 01:08:42.027
I...

01:08:42.064 --> 01:08:43.827
I love my babies.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:51.272
I love...

01:08:51.307 --> 01:08:53.366
to handle babies...

01:08:53.408 --> 01:08:55.309
because I love my babies.

01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:58.774
And I kiss them on their head...

01:09:00.249 --> 01:09:01.546
on their bald head.

01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:05.149
And I rub its head.

01:09:05.188 --> 01:09:06.678
I love it...

01:09:06.721 --> 01:09:09.189
and I hug it...

01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:11.352
then I kiss it, then I rub it.

01:09:14.197 --> 01:09:15.687
I rub its head.

01:09:16.933 --> 01:09:20.892
Sometimes, though,
I do something. I do it.

01:09:20.937 --> 01:09:24.134
My mom tells me, "Do something,"
then I do it.

01:09:24.173 --> 01:09:25.834
And I do it and do it.

01:09:27.243 --> 01:09:30.109
I clean house.
I sweep the floor.

01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:32.205
"Get in there
and mop that floor up."

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:34.910
I get in here
and mop the floor up.

01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:38.011
Whether it's water
or whether it's not water...

01:09:38.054 --> 01:09:39.316
I clean it up.

01:09:41.122 --> 01:09:43.057
And then when I cleaned it up...

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:49.626
I had it all straightened up,
even my dolls and all...

01:09:49.665 --> 01:09:51.792
straightened up.

01:09:51.834 --> 01:09:54.701
Now I always keep my toys...

01:09:54.737 --> 01:09:57.171
because I take care of them.

01:09:57.206 --> 01:10:02.576
And I always do, and I always do
take care of them.

01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:05.513
And then,
when I went to a store...

01:10:05.548 --> 01:10:09.678
I came back, and I got
in a hurry behind the car...

01:10:09.719 --> 01:10:14.452
and I broke
a... a spaghetti sauce.

01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:17.084
And when I did,
I got in trouble for it.

01:10:18.227 --> 01:10:21.788
And then, I didn't break it...

01:10:21.831 --> 01:10:24.425
but this always happens.

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:28.303
And then I turned around
and looked...

01:10:28.337 --> 01:10:32.671
and I said, "Laurel,
you going to have to pray."

01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:35.472
"No, you got to pray."

01:10:36.579 --> 01:10:39.480
And she said, "Pray about what?"

01:10:39.515 --> 01:10:41.881
And I said,
"You going to have to pray."

01:10:41.918 --> 01:10:44.079
You do have to pray...

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.712
white or black or whatever.

01:10:45.755 --> 01:10:46.915
Some people came by here.

01:10:46.956 --> 01:10:49.982
We're going to have
a lot of people here today.

01:10:51.294 --> 01:10:54.320
So we had to get up
this morning...

01:10:54.363 --> 01:10:55.523
and we did.

01:10:59.035 --> 01:11:00.195
Here it goes.

01:11:06.776 --> 01:11:09.745
Boy. I'm getting that stuff
in my hair.

01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:16.874
Well, well, well.

01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:18.409
Here I go.

01:11:35.438 --> 01:11:37.338
OK... in my hair.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.980
Miss?

01:13:32.822 --> 01:13:35.791
Miss, we've lost our cat,
and its name is Foot Foot.

01:13:35.825 --> 01:13:37.816
It's black,
and it's got green eyes.

01:13:38.861 --> 01:13:41.193
- What?
- We lost our cat.

01:13:42.398 --> 01:13:43.660
What do you want me to do?

01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:44.859
Well, if you see it,
could you call us?

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.333
- We live right over here.
- All right.

01:13:46.368 --> 01:13:48.359
Short black hair, kind of big.

01:13:48.404 --> 01:13:51.805
I don't live here in this town.

01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:54.241
But if... I will. I sure will.

01:13:54.276 --> 01:13:56.471
I haven't seen one, but I'll...

01:13:56.512 --> 01:13:58.673
Please keep an eye out.

01:13:58.714 --> 01:13:59.840
It's bad to lose one.

01:13:59.882 --> 01:14:02.510
I know mine went off one time,
but it come back.

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:04.416
- I hope so.
- Now I don't have one.

01:14:04.453 --> 01:14:07.286
- It died, you know.
- Oh, sorry.

01:14:07.323 --> 01:14:09.450
Black with green eyes.

01:14:09.492 --> 01:14:12.791
- Foot Foot?
- Yeah. Foot Foot.

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:14.090
Where'd you all lose him at?

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:17.622
If I see one,
I'll come back and tell you.

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:20.032
The number's on the flyer.
You can just call our number.

01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:22.697
- Yeah. All right.
- Ask for Helen, Dot, or Darby.

01:14:22.738 --> 01:14:23.898
All right.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.571
Those people are deaf.

01:15:07.883 --> 01:15:09.407
I'll bet she's cussing him out.

01:15:11.887 --> 01:15:13.855
You want mayonnaise, Darb?

01:15:13.889 --> 01:15:15.117
- You don't?
- No.

01:15:23.866 --> 01:15:25.857
Is this your cat?

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.803
Freddie Prinze was my brother.
Do you know of him?

01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:36.002
He was on that television series
called "Chico and the Man."

01:15:36.045 --> 01:15:37.307
Did you ever hear of that?

01:15:39.815 --> 01:15:41.544
He was an actor.

01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:42.744
What do you do?

01:15:44.053 --> 01:15:47.045
I'm a gossip writer
for a newspaper.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:50.115
- Gossip?
- You know gossip?

01:15:52.194 --> 01:15:54.992
It's like...
Tupac Shakur stuttered.

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:58.989
Warren Oates swallowed
his chewing tobacco spittle.

01:15:59.034 --> 01:16:01.901
Placido Domingo
loves sherbet ice cream.

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:04.701
Adolf Hitler had one testicle.

01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:09.735
P.T. Barnum had an ulcer
the size of a small oyster.

01:16:09.778 --> 01:16:12.872
Henry Winkler
is allergic to papaya.

01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:16.407
Satchel Paige
shot heroin down in Cuba.

01:16:16.452 --> 01:16:20.013
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer
drank denatured alcohol.

01:16:20.055 --> 01:16:21.488
That's gossip.

01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:23.013
And that's what you get paid
for doing?

01:16:24.693 --> 01:16:26.354
I get paid for writing rumor.

01:16:43.612 --> 01:16:45.637
How much further is it
to where you saw Foot Foot?

01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:48.013
It's right nearby here.
It's right around here.

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.278
Where?

01:16:49.318 --> 01:16:51.548
Well, I'm not sure exactly,
but is there a map?

01:16:51.587 --> 01:16:54.021
There's a map in the glove box
or here somewhere.

01:16:54.056 --> 01:16:55.683
Maybe it's under the seat
down there.

01:16:55.724 --> 01:16:57.521
Let me... let me see
if I can reach it.

01:16:57.559 --> 01:16:59.993
- I don't see no map around.
- Maybe I can...

01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:02.294
What are you doing?

01:17:02.331 --> 01:17:04.128
Why'd you try and touch
her kootchy?

01:17:04.166 --> 01:17:07.067
- I didn't do anything.
- Pervert!

01:17:09.371 --> 01:17:12.101
- Now, come on.
- Get out of here!

01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:13.369
Don't touch her kootchy!

01:17:13.409 --> 01:17:14.706
Come on. Just give me a little.

01:17:14.743 --> 01:17:16.074
Let go of her!

01:17:16.111 --> 01:17:18.443
- Get off!
- Fucking pervert!

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.913
Stop!

01:17:19.949 --> 01:17:21.382
Just give me some. That's all.

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:24.113
- Let go of her, motherfucker!
- You're hos anyway.

01:17:24.153 --> 01:17:25.586
It's no big deal.

01:17:25.621 --> 01:17:27.885
It's nothing new
for trash like you.

01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:30.016
Kiss my ass, fucker!

01:17:30.059 --> 01:17:32.152
Motherfucker!
Don't touch my sister!

01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:35.061
Nothing new for trash like you.

01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:36.758
Fuck you!

01:17:36.799 --> 01:17:39.859
Baby. Fucking asshole!

01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:41.927
Idiot!

01:17:42.104 --> 01:17:45.005
I knew a guy who was dyslexic...

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.167
but he was also cross-eyed...

01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:48.836
so everything came out right.

01:19:09.358 --> 01:19:10.848
Spaghetti.

01:19:24.039 --> 01:19:25.563
Hand me the shampoo.

01:19:27.376 --> 01:19:29.674
That's the conditioner.
Hand me the other bottle.

01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:31.971
Hi, my name is Terry.
This is my brother Phelipo.

01:20:32.007 --> 01:20:33.133
Hi, ma'am.

01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:35.268
Would you be interested
in purchasing a crunch bar?

01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:36.902
- How much?
- A dollar.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.311
The money
goes for children with cancer.

01:20:40.349 --> 01:20:42.249
Also,
it's for Hodgkin's disease.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.983
- Thanks.
- OK.

01:20:47.022 --> 01:20:48.216
Have a nice day.

01:20:57.699 --> 01:20:58.859
Some dessert?

01:21:54.489 --> 01:21:56.650
Man, we be making
all this money.

01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:58.956
Yeah. All the hos like this.

01:21:58.994 --> 01:22:00.825
Yeah. Buy the teachers, too...

01:22:00.862 --> 01:22:02.830
so I wouldn't have
to go to school no more.

01:22:02.864 --> 01:22:04.354
Tease people, too.

01:22:04.399 --> 01:22:07.197
Yeah. Make them my friend, then
I tease them with the money.

01:22:07.236 --> 01:22:09.500
They'll be my friends
more often also.

01:22:09.538 --> 01:22:13.599
Yeah. We can have all this.
We can be rich.

01:22:13.642 --> 01:22:16.008
We'll be going around
teasing women and stuff.

01:22:16.044 --> 01:22:18.342
Yeah. Selling candy,
getting money.

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.813
Just selling candy,
getting money...

01:22:19.848 --> 01:22:21.406
and making the greenbacks.

01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:24.314
I was all right

01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:26.651
For awhile

01:22:26.688 --> 01:22:28.588
I could smile

01:22:28.624 --> 01:22:31.593
For awhile

01:22:31.627 --> 01:22:33.788
But I saw you last night

01:22:33.829 --> 01:22:36.491
You held my hand so tight

01:22:36.531 --> 01:22:38.021
As you stopped

01:22:38.066 --> 01:22:41.433
To say hello

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:44.234
Oh, you wished me well

01:22:44.273 --> 01:22:47.572
You couldn't tell

01:22:47.609 --> 01:22:49.406
That I'd been

01:22:49.444 --> 01:22:51.810
Crying

01:22:51.847 --> 01:22:54.247
Over you

01:22:54.283 --> 01:22:56.547
Crying

01:22:56.585 --> 01:22:59.019
Over you

01:22:59.054 --> 01:23:00.817
And you

01:23:00.856 --> 01:23:03.347
Said so long

01:23:03.392 --> 01:23:05.952
Left me standing

01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:07.962
All alone

01:23:07.996 --> 01:23:11.295
Alone and crying

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:13.767
Crying

01:23:13.802 --> 01:23:16.202
Crying

01:23:16.238 --> 01:23:17.466
Crying

01:23:17.506 --> 01:23:22.910
It's hard to understand

01:23:22.944 --> 01:23:25.310
But the touch

01:23:25.347 --> 01:23:27.372
Of your hand

01:23:27.416 --> 01:23:29.941
Can start me crying

01:23:32.421 --> 01:23:34.912
I thought that I

01:23:34.956 --> 01:23:37.652
Was over you

01:23:37.693 --> 01:23:40.355
But it's true

01:23:40.395 --> 01:23:42.329
So true

01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:45.060
I love you even more

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.864
Than I did before

01:23:47.903 --> 01:23:52.567
But, darling, what can I do?

01:23:52.607 --> 01:23:55.007
For you don't

01:23:55.043 --> 01:23:57.443
Love me

01:23:57.479 --> 01:24:02.849
And I'll always be

01:24:02.884 --> 01:24:05.409
Crying

01:24:05.454 --> 01:24:07.979
Over you

01:24:08.023 --> 01:24:10.548
Crying

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:13.060
Over you

01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:14.995
Yes

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.760
Now you're gone

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:22.361
And from this moment on

01:24:22.404 --> 01:24:25.601
I'll be crying

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.131
Crying

01:24:28.176 --> 01:24:30.701
Crying

01:24:30.746 --> 01:24:32.873
Crying

01:24:32.914 --> 01:24:38.511
Yeah, crying

01:24:38.553 --> 01:24:40.153
Crying

01:24:43.759 --> 01:24:45.359
Over

01:24:48.897 --> 01:24:50.497
You

01:24:59.007 --> 01:25:01.805
Yes, Jesus loves me

01:25:09.918 --> 01:25:13.786
For the bible tells me so

01:25:19.428 --> 01:25:21.362
Dial it now. It's a bad dime.
