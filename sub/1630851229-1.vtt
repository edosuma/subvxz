09:45.026 --> 09:47.068
Hang in.

09:47.070 --> 09:50.171
I'll go update your dad
and I'll be right back.

09:52.317 --> 09:56.094
Hey... you're in good hands now.

10:01.993 --> 10:03.509
So, we just took Esty to CT.

10:03.511 --> 10:05.252
I'll let you know the minute
we have a full picture

10:05.254 --> 10:06.754
of her condition, okay?

10:06.756 --> 10:08.681
Okay. Thank you.

10:08.683 --> 10:11.835
I-I-I... I can't lose her.

10:11.837 --> 10:14.446
I-I'm reeling here, I'm...

10:14.448 --> 10:16.364
Sit down, sit down.

10:21.696 --> 10:27.016
I-I know everyone says that
their kid is special, but...

10:27.018 --> 10:28.627
Esty...

10:28.629 --> 10:31.579
She's something else.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.634
She's compassionate, loving.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.694
She's my whole life.

10:37.696 --> 10:41.197
You know, her mom left
a year after she was born.

10:41.199 --> 10:44.351
It's always been
just the two of us.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.463
I get it.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.891
I'm a father, too.

10:51.893 --> 10:53.726
I can imagine how awful
this is for you,

10:53.728 --> 10:56.804
but rest assured, we are doing
everything we can.

10:56.806 --> 10:59.240
-(phone vibrating)
-Okay?

11:04.313 --> 11:07.982
I'm sorry.
Just give me a minute.

11:07.984 --> 11:09.483
Hey, Marion,

12:39.760 --> 12:42.576
There. Basilar skull fracture.

12:42.578 --> 12:43.987
Good call, Conrad.

12:43.989 --> 12:45.671
There's no evidence of bleed.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.248
We should be able to
get away without operating.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.826
Well, we may not be so lucky
with her abdominal injuries.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.995

you have a fractured radius

16:44.170 --> 16:45.652

We're gonna have to
reset the bone, okay?

18:32.337 --> 18:33.760

18:33.762 --> 18:35.688
I have an old college friend,
a brilliant one,

18:35.690 --> 18:38.098
who made it her mission to
turn the tables on hackers

18:38.100 --> 18:41.694
who are stealing from
old people online.

18:41.696 --> 18:43.621
That happened to
my uncle once.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.198
They pretended he had
a bank refund coming in,

18:46.200 --> 18:49.127
got him to give them
the number of the account,

18:49.129 --> 18:52.130
and then they took
his entire life savings.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.955
Nice, but...

19:01.957 --> 19:03.957
possibly inappropriate

19:03.959 --> 19:06.369
Thank you. Thank you for
helping me remember her.

19:06.371 --> 19:09.221

why this happened?

19:43.332 --> 19:45.925
We don't know for sure,
but our full team is on it.

19:45.927 --> 19:48.186
And we're gonna do as extensive
of a workup as we can,

19:48.188 --> 19:50.579
despite this ransomware attack.

19:50.581 --> 19:52.190
It just feels like
everyone I love disappears.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.358
-If anything happens to Esty...
-Don't go there.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.437
Any heart problems
in the family?

19:58.439 --> 20:00.198
Uh...

20:00.200 --> 20:03.850
I had an EKG once.
They said it was negative,

20:03.852 --> 20:05.185
my heart was fine.

20:05.187 --> 20:07.538
I have one brother--
he's healthy, too--

20:07.540 --> 20:11.083
but our-our father died
young of a heart attack.

20:13.696 --> 20:15.421
Okay.

20:17.275 --> 20:18.633
Okay, give me a minute.

20:23.114 --> 20:25.205

for emergency surgeries?
-For now.

20:25.207 --> 20:28.467

who can be moved

20:30.471 --> 20:32.121
is being transported
to Atlanta General.

20:32.123 --> 20:35.024
We should probably transfer Esty
just to be safe.

20:37.886 --> 20:40.387
Talk to my team.
Be right back.

20:40.389 --> 20:43.315
How are we looking? Can we
move her to Atlanta General?

20:43.317 --> 20:44.800
Neuro exam is still stable.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.303

What's wrong?

20:53.811 --> 20:55.811
Daddy, my shoulder hurts.

20:55.813 --> 20:57.329
How about here?

20:57.331 --> 20:59.648
(pained groan)
Yeah, that hurts, too.

20:59.650 --> 21:01.984
Much more than before.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.410
Sir, you should step outside.

21:03.412 --> 21:06.155
The shoulder pain is referred
pain from the abdomen.

21:06.157 --> 21:08.099
Her splenic lac
must be worsening.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.825
Her pressure is trending down.
90/60.

21:09.827 --> 21:11.494

Well, she's too unstable.
We need to get blood into her,

21:11.496 --> 21:14.497
and we need to find a way
to operate as soon as we can.

21:14.499 --> 21:16.665
Our ORs are vulnerable
to attack.

21:16.667 --> 21:20.194
Well, if this gets any worse,
she could bleed out and die.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.031
Daddy!

21:31.182 --> 21:34.199
-Daddy!
-LEELA: It's okay.
We're gonna help him.

21:34.201 --> 21:36.443
-CONRAD: His heart's racing,
just like Esty's.
-Daddy!

21:36.445 --> 21:38.871
-CONRAD: Ambu Bag.
-AUSTIN: Give me
the defib pads now.

21:38.873 --> 21:39.964
ESTY:
Daddy?!

21:40.133 --> 21:42.949
LEELA: It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

21:42.951 --> 21:45.386
AUSTIN:
All right, charging. 200.

21:46.714 --> 21:48.380
Daddy...

21:48.382 --> 21:49.381
Clear!

21:49.383 --> 21:52.351
♪

22:00.227 --> 22:02.636
All non-emergent surgeries
canceled. I can help.

22:02.638 --> 22:03.804
Great. Uh, can you handle

22:03.806 --> 22:04.897
the extensor tendon injury
in Three?

22:04.899 --> 22:06.549
Yes.

22:06.551 --> 22:09.309
Hey, Nolan,
I have to go upstairs.

22:09.311 --> 22:11.904
I called in a friend who might
be able to help Chastain

22:11.906 --> 22:14.073
with this attack;
it could be a while.

22:14.075 --> 22:15.649
-Yeah, go ahead. I got you.
-Okay.

22:15.651 --> 22:18.060
Oh, and when you get a chance,
can you take Winston

22:18.062 --> 22:19.986
-down to the cast room?
-Sure.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.622
Hey, give me directions.
I can find my way

22:21.624 --> 22:22.898
with my cane.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.400
I'm sure the elevator
has braille.

22:24.402 --> 22:25.751
No can do, buddy.

22:25.753 --> 22:28.262
Let me finish up here and
I'll take you myself, okay?

22:30.350 --> 22:33.059
(beeping)

22:39.508 --> 22:41.525
(groaning)

22:45.531 --> 22:47.590
What happened?

22:47.592 --> 22:50.684
Your heart went into a dangerous
rhythm called V tach,

22:50.686 --> 22:53.037
and you passed out.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.206
It's the same thing
that happened to Esty.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.192
You mentioned you had an EKG?

22:59.194 --> 23:02.271
Yeah. I got, uh,
hit with a line drive

23:02.273 --> 23:04.623
at an Atlanta Braves game.

23:04.625 --> 23:08.460
Passed out. A few minutes after,
they, they took me

23:08.462 --> 23:10.295
to the, uh, ER.

23:10.297 --> 23:13.707
-EKG was normal.
-Which ER?

23:13.709 --> 23:16.060
Atlanta General.

23:18.623 --> 23:19.730
Oh!

23:19.732 --> 23:21.381
(pained groans)

23:21.383 --> 23:23.383
AUSTIN:
It's not V tach.

23:23.385 --> 23:25.628
Anterior ST elevation.
He's having a heart attack.

23:26.631 --> 23:31.500
Amy, we need 325 of aspirin,
sublingual nitro,

23:31.502 --> 23:32.743
and 5,000 units of heparin.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.227
Run to the pharmacy.

23:34.229 --> 23:35.579
-Is the CATH lab up?
-Last time I checked.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.397
Fluoro is still working.
I'll take him there.

23:37.399 --> 23:39.917
I'll meet you as soon as I can.
I got to call Atlanta General.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.920
The ORs have lost power
and they have no imaging.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.256
We have critical patients
who need surgery.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.317
It's life or death right now.
We have to act.

23:48.319 --> 23:50.986
KIT:
We must pay the ransom,
and we must pay it now.

23:50.988 --> 23:52.838
If that means I'm fired,
so be it.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.248
We have to get the bank to
move quickly with the money.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.176
We will pay in cryptocurrency.

23:57.178 --> 23:59.161
They will dictate the process.

23:59.163 --> 24:02.088
If you refuse to do this,

24:02.090 --> 24:03.757
you'll have blood
on your hands.

24:03.759 --> 24:05.592
Dr. Voss, sorry to interrupt,

24:05.594 --> 24:07.594
but I have someone who
might be able to help you.

24:07.596 --> 24:09.447
This is Jessie Bhattacharjee,
an old friend,

24:09.449 --> 24:13.266
who made a crusade of exposing
phishing scammers online,

24:13.268 --> 24:16.528
the kind that raid
personal computers.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.197
-This is a whole other league.
-We know.

24:18.199 --> 24:19.957
But the exploit I created
hasn't been deployed

24:19.959 --> 24:21.366
on your particular malware.

24:21.368 --> 24:22.851
With a little tweaking,
it could work.

24:22.853 --> 24:24.110
DEVON:
There's a chance

24:24.112 --> 24:26.205
that we can turn the tables
on these hackers.

24:26.207 --> 24:27.798
KIT:
It's too late.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.191
They want the money now.

24:29.193 --> 24:30.859
We need the ORs.
They've lost power.

24:30.861 --> 24:32.970
Okay, get to work.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.182
And just stall
as long as you can.

24:39.386 --> 24:41.795
CONRAD:
I've been waiting ten minutes.

24:41.797 --> 24:43.147
This is urgent.

24:43.149 --> 24:46.132
<i> WOMAN (over phone):</i>
<i> Okay, okay, hold on.</i>

24:46.134 --> 24:48.560
<i> I think I got it.</i>
<i> EKG on Ronan Hartman</i>

24:48.562 --> 24:49.820
<i> from last August.</i>

24:49.822 --> 24:52.548
<i> Um, no ischemic changes.</i>
<i> Nothing going on.</i>

24:52.550 --> 24:56.235
What I'm looking for is
subtle and easily missed.

24:56.237 --> 24:57.720
Coved ST elevations in V2

24:57.722 --> 25:00.889
or V3, like you see
in Brugada syndrome. Look again.

25:00.891 --> 25:04.560
<i> Hmm. I'll be damned. Yes.</i>

25:04.562 --> 25:06.912
<i> Subtle, but it's there.</i>
<i> Brugada waves.</i>

25:06.914 --> 25:09.465
Text me an image.
And thank you.

25:11.159 --> 25:15.404
Yes, we've agreed to your terms.
$10 million.

25:15.406 --> 25:17.163
There's a minor glitch
on our end.

25:17.165 --> 25:19.016
We're waiting for the bank
to release the funds

25:19.018 --> 25:21.334
so we can convert
to cryptocurrency.

25:22.096 --> 25:24.747
<i> HACKER:</i>
<i> Why should we b-believe you?</i>

25:24.749 --> 25:26.857
The money is coming.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.027
We just need a little more time.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.595
This is Mr. Robards.

25:39.597 --> 25:42.281
He has a fractured radius
just below the elbow.

25:42.283 --> 25:43.523
I'll be right with him.

25:43.525 --> 25:45.525
Can you have him wait
over there?

25:45.527 --> 25:48.120
Uh, yeah, sure.

25:48.122 --> 25:50.196
Winston, just gonna
chill out here

25:50.198 --> 25:51.423
for a minute, okay, buddy?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.553
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's nothing.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.347
-Just a hell of a headache.
-Uh-huh.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.393
All right, Winston,
I'm gonna need you to

26:02.395 --> 26:03.894
hang out here for a second,
okay?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.712
I'm gonna have you
hold onto that, okay?

26:05.714 --> 26:06.880
Thank you, Dr. Nolan.

26:06.882 --> 26:08.307
Thank the whole ER team
for me.

26:08.309 --> 26:11.235
It's more than our pleasure.
Take care, all right?

26:29.237 --> 26:32.072
CONRAD:
Ronan has Brugada.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.999
Likely his father did, too.

26:34.001 --> 26:36.409
Esty must have inherited it.

26:36.411 --> 26:37.820
Strong work.

26:37.822 --> 26:40.505
All right, a family history
of sudden cardiac death.

26:40.507 --> 26:43.017
Well, they both need
defibrillators.

26:44.086 --> 26:46.662
But that's the least
of his problems.

26:46.664 --> 26:50.423
Ronan's heart couldn't tolerate
the rapid rhythm.

26:50.425 --> 26:52.926
He's having a massive
anterior wall MI.

26:52.928 --> 26:55.003
Severe blockage
of the left main.

26:55.005 --> 26:56.505
Tight narrowing of the LAD.

26:56.507 --> 26:57.931
This is a widow-maker, Hawkins.

26:57.933 --> 27:00.008
This isn't amenable to stent.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.786
The ORs are down, and if
we don't operate now,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.372
he'll be dead in an hour.

27:06.274 --> 27:08.459
Esty's running out of time, too.

27:11.188 --> 27:13.964
(line ringing)

27:13.966 --> 27:16.525
Devon, it's me.
I need your help.

27:16.527 --> 27:19.219
Listen to me carefully.

27:22.216 --> 27:24.391
(beeping steadily)

27:25.645 --> 27:26.960
Where are we at?

27:26.962 --> 27:29.462
We've given her two
units of blood,

27:29.464 --> 27:30.463
and she's still hypotensive.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.358
Her splenic bleed is
opening up.

27:34.228 --> 27:36.195
Look.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.206
Halo sign.
This is spinal fluid.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.244
BELL:
The skull fracture.

27:52.246 --> 27:54.004
Created a tear in the dura,
the lining of the brain.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.414
She doesn't just need
a splenectomy.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.582
Now, with this CSF leak,
she's at high risk of infection.

27:57.584 --> 27:58.901
That's just great.

27:58.903 --> 28:01.011
Let's start her on vancomycin
and ceftriaxone.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.515
-Esty will need
neurosurgery, too.
-BELL: No, that's impossible.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.759
We don't have an OR,
or imaging of any kind.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.579
We do of her spleen and brain.

28:10.581 --> 28:13.232
I drew what I saw
after the CT went down.

28:17.254 --> 28:18.754
You have an incredible
visual memory.

28:18.756 --> 28:22.366
-And you're an artist.
-(phone vibrating)

28:22.368 --> 28:24.034
It's Devon.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.929
Talk fast, friend.
Two lives are on the line.

28:26.931 --> 28:28.430
We found a power station.

28:28.432 --> 28:30.265
<i> Does it have enough juice?</i>

28:30.267 --> 28:32.543
Just enough to light up one OR.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.786
We'll have to bag intubated
patients,

28:34.788 --> 28:36.863
repurpose defibrillators
to monitor heart rates,

28:36.865 --> 28:38.031
and hand-crank
the bypass machine.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.426
We're on our way
with two patients.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.209
He's tanking. Please tell me
there's an OR ready.

28:49.211 --> 28:50.728
We'll have to handle
two patients at once.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.480
We only have one OR
in the hospital with any power.

29:01.315 --> 29:03.240
Excuse me.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.651
I've been waiting to get
a cast for some time now,

29:06.653 --> 29:08.820
and it's starting
to really hurt a lot.

29:08.822 --> 29:11.081
And this sling helps
a little, but...

29:11.083 --> 29:13.825
I-I'm so sorry.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.327
Our tech just
went home sick,

29:15.329 --> 29:18.404
and I don't feel great myself.
I'll find someone else

29:18.406 --> 29:19.664
to do your cast for you.

29:19.666 --> 29:23.001
Will you be okay down here alone
for a few minutes?

29:23.003 --> 29:26.764
Yes, but please, I-I,
I don't mean to be a pain,

29:26.766 --> 29:28.748
but I've been here all day,

29:28.750 --> 29:30.250
so please don't make me wait
much longer.

29:30.252 --> 29:33.437
I'll have someone with you
as soon as possible.

29:41.839 --> 29:44.430
BELL:
Need more suction.

29:44.432 --> 29:46.266
Lap pad.

29:46.268 --> 29:49.453
AUSTIN:
Bell, I need your
assist on the CABG.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.530
BELL:
My hands are a little full
at the moment.

29:51.532 --> 29:52.790
AUSTIN:
Yeah, well, mine are, too.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.441
I have a massive anterior MI,

29:55.443 --> 29:58.462
and you seem to have
capable assistants.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.714
Well, I'm just finishing
the splenectomy.

30:02.209 --> 30:04.042
Okay, Leela, I'm gonna need
you to take it from here.

30:04.044 --> 30:05.135
LEELA:
Got it.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.711
I know her anatomy
well from the scans.

30:06.713 --> 30:09.548
And I can help, as soon as
I patch the dura here.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.225
All right, let's
put him on bypass.

30:15.039 --> 30:16.204
Talk to me.

30:16.206 --> 30:18.631
His arteries are so
calcified, we can't find

30:18.633 --> 30:20.208
a good landing zone.

30:20.210 --> 30:21.226
It's a tough graft.

30:21.228 --> 30:23.362
Needle driver to me.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.735
Devi, Sutton, how's it going?

30:30.737 --> 30:33.813
Found the bleeder at the
resection line. Got it.

30:33.815 --> 30:35.499
BILLIE:
Still working on patching
the dura.

30:35.501 --> 30:39.077
I'm using AlloDerm, but I
can't stop the CSF leak.

30:39.079 --> 30:42.080
Leela, harvest a piece
of omentum.

30:42.082 --> 30:43.565
I need to use the
lining of her abdomen

30:43.567 --> 30:45.734
to patch the dura
and seal her brain.

30:45.736 --> 30:47.177
On it.

30:47.179 --> 30:52.516
-Okay, we are there.
-All right, stop bypass.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.742
(alarm beeping)

30:53.744 --> 30:55.352
AUSTIN:
He's in V fib.

30:55.354 --> 30:59.022
Charge to 20 and give
him an amp of epi.

31:01.935 --> 31:03.009
Epi.

31:03.011 --> 31:06.113
-Clear!
-(electric jolt)

31:07.199 --> 31:08.757
Again!

31:08.759 --> 31:11.760
(machine powering up)

31:11.762 --> 31:14.854
-Clear!
-(electric jolt)

31:14.856 --> 31:17.690
-(flatlining)
-Damn it!

31:17.692 --> 31:20.102
-Clear!
-(electric jolt)

31:20.104 --> 31:21.937
-(flatline continues)
-All right, someone,

31:21.939 --> 31:24.530
someone with another idea.

31:24.532 --> 31:26.458
Okay, the grafts are patent.
There's no clot.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.944
-A good arterial flow.
-Why did this happen?

31:28.946 --> 31:31.630
Because his ventricle
was too sick.

31:31.632 --> 31:33.281
It couldn't tolerate being
on bypass.

31:33.283 --> 31:34.966
No, that-that's unacceptable.
We can't call it.

31:34.968 --> 31:37.895
He's going through
multisystem organ failure.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.288
We have to keep trying.
Think of Esty.

31:40.290 --> 31:43.341
I am thinking about Esty!

31:43.343 --> 31:45.794
I'm the one who has to tell her
that we lost her father!

31:45.796 --> 31:50.132
BELL:
Ea-Easy. Steady. Ev-Everyone.
Just...

31:50.134 --> 31:52.576
even with full power, it would
have ended this way.

31:52.578 --> 31:56.496
They call it the
widow-maker for a reason.

31:58.325 --> 32:03.128
Leela... stop cardiac massage.

32:32.676 --> 32:33.784
(door opens)

32:33.786 --> 32:35.435
Time of death: 16:04.

32:35.437 --> 32:36.845
(door closes)

32:36.847 --> 32:39.081
(sighs)

32:57.459 --> 33:00.227
Hello?

33:09.730 --> 33:13.991
Hello? Hello?

33:17.070 --> 33:20.205
(coughing)

33:24.411 --> 33:27.579
(groans)

33:27.581 --> 33:29.655
Somebody help.

33:29.657 --> 33:31.733
(coughing)

33:31.735 --> 33:33.877
(coughing continues)

33:33.879 --> 33:35.920
Help me.

33:36.849 --> 33:39.499
I'm almost done
updating the exploit.

33:39.501 --> 33:41.852
We'll stall them
as long as possible.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.094
<i> HACKER:</i>
<i> Time is up.</i>

33:43.096 --> 33:44.929
<i> -Where's our money?</i>
-KIT: Good news.

33:44.931 --> 33:46.931
The bank has released the funds.

33:46.933 --> 33:49.026
The entire board is here

33:49.028 --> 33:52.103
to witness this transfer.
It will be done.

33:52.105 --> 33:55.423
However, the crypto exchange
you directed us to

33:55.425 --> 33:57.183
has flagged the transaction but

33:57.185 --> 33:58.518
says it should be approved

33:58.520 --> 34:00.520
-momentarily.
<i> -You are lying.</i>

34:00.522 --> 34:02.539
<i> All of your data</i>
<i> will be destroyed.</i>

34:02.541 --> 34:05.992
KIT:
Please, we're almost there.
You'll have all...

34:06.787 --> 34:08.712
...all of your money very soon.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.505
Be patient.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.054
It's done.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.965
I'll send proof of payment now.

34:20.967 --> 34:23.009
(chime)

34:23.011 --> 34:25.303
Hello, fellas.

34:25.305 --> 34:28.381
So, which one of you is Russian?

34:28.383 --> 34:31.293
Because your IP address says
you're in Baltimore.

34:31.295 --> 34:33.478
Oh, I wouldn't bother fleeing.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.739
The FBI are on their way
to greet you.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.390
Log out, log out.

34:37.392 --> 34:38.817
-(computer chimes)
-(laughs)

34:38.819 --> 34:42.987
(applause and cheering)

34:42.989 --> 34:45.165
Yes!

35:11.001 --> 35:12.758
My heart is breaking
for this girl.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.986
Mine, too.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.448
Life hangs
by such a fragile thread, man.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.617
One minute, I'm talking to him,
and then, the next...

35:21.603 --> 35:23.769
You know what?
I'm the one telling people

35:23.771 --> 35:26.439
not to get emotionally involved,

35:26.441 --> 35:29.275
but Esty--

35:29.277 --> 35:31.795
she's a special girl, man.

35:32.856 --> 35:35.039
And her father will not
see her...

35:35.041 --> 35:36.875
graduate.

35:36.877 --> 35:40.095
He won't
walk her down the aisle.

35:42.032 --> 35:44.957
You know, you did everything
humanly possible.

35:44.959 --> 35:48.052
The-the man had a time bomb
in his chest.

35:48.054 --> 35:51.039
Yeah, we could have
lost them both.

35:51.041 --> 35:52.374
We almost did.

35:52.376 --> 35:56.060
BELL:
You know, the silver lining
for Esty is

35:56.062 --> 35:58.213
that Conrad diagnosed
her Brugada.

35:58.215 --> 36:00.715
And when she recovers,
she'll get a defibrillator.

36:00.717 --> 36:02.826
And without that,
she would have died young

36:02.828 --> 36:04.661
like her father
and her grandfather.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.555
But she's gonna be alone, Bell.

36:07.557 --> 36:09.574
CONRAD:
Well, her father mentioned
Esty's mother.

36:09.576 --> 36:11.743
She left
shortly after Esty's birth.

36:11.745 --> 36:14.913
So I had our social workers
reach out to them.

36:14.915 --> 36:17.399
They're working hard
to find her.

36:17.401 --> 36:18.917
'Cause, yeah, maybe they will.

36:18.919 --> 36:20.660
The woman left Esty already.

36:20.662 --> 36:22.846
There's no way she's gonna
love her the way Ronan did.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.015
Well, I have hope.

36:26.167 --> 36:29.227
It's hard not
to love a child like Esty.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.099
She has an uncle.

36:35.101 --> 36:38.987
Her father listed his brother
as next of kin.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.531
I'll call him.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.159
He should be here
when you tell her.

36:48.523 --> 36:50.957
I have to pick up my daughter.

36:59.033 --> 37:02.126
(Kit and Devon speaking
baby talk)

37:02.128 --> 37:06.448
-(Marshall laughs)
-(GiGi babbles)

37:06.450 --> 37:09.392
(laughs)
Yeah. Oh, they're very nice.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.394
-Can I borrow those?
-DEVON: Wow.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.621
-KIT: She's gorgeous.
-MARSHALL:
The nursery called me.

37:13.623 --> 37:15.715
Grandpa to the rescue.

37:15.717 --> 37:19.885
Incredible job, man,
jerry-rigging that OR.

37:19.887 --> 37:21.963
Yeah, well, it takes a village.

37:21.965 --> 37:23.314
And luckily, we have one.

37:23.316 --> 37:24.983
MARSHALL:
That's not all Devon did.

37:24.985 --> 37:28.227
His, uh, buddy Jessie,
a gray-hat hacker,

37:28.229 --> 37:30.080
beat the attackers
at their own game.

37:30.082 --> 37:33.992
Yeah, we got them on camera.
Now the FBI can track them down.

37:33.994 --> 37:35.901
All systems are secure
and back online.

37:35.903 --> 37:39.965
The hospital power has been
restored, including the ORs.

37:42.335 --> 37:45.503
-(gasps)
-You know what a lucky man

37:45.505 --> 37:48.080
-you are to have
this little one?
-(kisses)

37:48.082 --> 37:51.601
Yes, I'm aware
of exactly how lucky I am.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.980
Never more than at this moment.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.671
I have to go sign out
my last few patients.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.859
-I'll wait for you.
-No.

38:24.861 --> 38:27.028
No, you go on home.

38:27.030 --> 38:30.548
I'll go to my place,
you go to yours.

38:31.384 --> 38:33.384
-We'll sleep. (laughs)
-(laughs)

38:33.386 --> 38:35.386
Something we don't do a lot of

38:35.388 --> 38:37.981
when we spend the night
together.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.226
LEELA:
And... we can

38:42.228 --> 38:45.547
talk about moving in together

38:45.549 --> 38:48.491
over coffee
tomorrow morning, okay?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.995
Okay.

38:55.408 --> 38:57.459
I'll see you.

39:02.749 --> 39:05.825
Hey, guys, get out of here.
Next shift is coming.

39:05.827 --> 39:07.919
Yeah, fine. No argument there.

39:07.921 --> 39:10.680
We're getting a beer.
Come along.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.183
-You're buying.
-(laughs)

39:16.688 --> 39:18.580
We must get hammered.

39:18.582 --> 39:22.150
Um, not yet.
I'm almost finished.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.197
Hey, I don't see
that Winston ever checked out.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.774
Did-did he get his cast?

39:29.776 --> 39:32.202
Nolan took him down there.

39:32.204 --> 39:36.039
Yup, took him there in person,
safe and sound.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.859
He must have left
without signing out.

39:39.861 --> 39:42.295
You can check on him tomorrow.

39:44.532 --> 39:46.532
Hey, Shelly,

39:46.534 --> 39:48.126
I'm gonna go down

39:48.128 --> 39:50.720
and check on my patient
Winston Robards, okay?

39:51.539 --> 39:53.973
(elevator bell dings)

40:09.799 --> 40:13.660
Hello? Hello?

40:29.261 --> 40:30.818
Winston.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.504
Winston? Winston?

40:33.506 --> 40:35.598
Hey, Winston?
Wake up, buddy. Come on.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.992
(coughing)

40:37.994 --> 40:40.603
Hey, can I get some help
in here?

40:40.605 --> 40:43.606
(coughs)
Winston?

40:43.608 --> 40:46.926
(coughing)

40:46.928 --> 40:51.506
You know, apart from work,
I spend 90% of my time alone.

40:51.508 --> 40:53.191
Me, too.

40:53.193 --> 40:56.194
Tonight I just especially
am kind of feeling it.

40:56.196 --> 40:58.103
-Yeah.
-Hey, do you...?

40:58.105 --> 41:00.331
Do you want to get a bite?

41:02.519 --> 41:05.128
That's really, really sweet, but

41:05.130 --> 41:07.130
-I am just whipped, and...
-Yeah, of course you are.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.691
That's... No, that's, uh...
Forget I asked. It's, uh...

41:09.693 --> 41:12.343
You know, it's not like
I meant anything by it.

41:13.530 --> 41:16.288
-Good night.
-Night. Good night.
