00:01.006 --> 00:05.126
I saw them at the guest cottage,
him and the Jew.

00:05.375 --> 00:07.733
They're rutting at Ash Park.

00:07.735 --> 00:10.813
If you even think
of marrying this woman,

00:10.815 --> 00:13.933
Ash Park will go to James.

00:13.935 --> 00:16.733
What sort of man do you think I am?

00:16.735 --> 00:21.013
I won't have our baby born
into her pit of poison.

00:21.015 --> 00:22.535
Livvy?

00:30.375 --> 00:34.375
We should go. To the city.
You were right.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.186
The child that I gave away
to be raised by others -

00:38.188 --> 00:39.946
it was you.

00:39.948 --> 00:45.106
I'll marry Gino,
and I will have the baby.

00:45.108 --> 00:46.908
Marry me.

00:48.601 --> 00:54.107

00:58.028 --> 01:00.108
You may have overplayed your hand.

01:01.308 --> 01:03.468
Then I'll deal another.

01:05.548 --> 01:08.668
Of course I want to say yes.
Then say it.

01:10.268 --> 01:11.906
Why now?

01:11.908 --> 01:14.546
I know what I want now.
Why the sudden urgency?

01:14.548 --> 01:16.946
Does it matter?
Yes.

01:16.948 --> 01:20.468
Mother threatened to disinherit me
if we stay together.

01:21.468 --> 01:23.506
So this is... defiance?

01:23.508 --> 01:24.586
No.

01:24.588 --> 01:26.906
I'm doing something
I should have done weeks ago.

01:26.908 --> 01:29.946
But we're happy with the way it is.
I'm not.

01:29.948 --> 01:32.226
You deserve to be
more than my mistress.

01:32.228 --> 01:36.866
You deserve more than stolen moments
and a charade in public.

01:36.868 --> 01:38.708
There are practicalities, George.
Damn them.

01:42.868 --> 01:46.468
What does your heart say? Say it.

01:48.948 --> 01:51.348
Yes.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.386
George?

02:15.388 --> 02:18.066
Oh. My darling.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.746
Is something wrong?

02:19.748 --> 02:22.386
A small matter with your father.

02:22.388 --> 02:24.988
I don't want to add to your worries.

02:25.868 --> 02:28.428
Would you like me to leave?

02:29.628 --> 02:31.506
If you wouldn't mind.

02:31.508 --> 02:33.428
Of... of course.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.388
Would you see
if there's any sign of George?

02:45.188 --> 02:48.386
You know how hard things have been
for Livvy and me.

02:48.388 --> 02:51.506
We're much closer now.
We're stronger.

02:51.508 --> 02:53.988
But, uh...

02:54.988 --> 02:57.466
there are tensions here, and...

02:57.468 --> 03:01.108
James, get to the point.
I may not live much longer.

03:02.108 --> 03:04.708
We want to spend some time
in the city.

03:06.548 --> 03:08.068
Good!

03:09.548 --> 03:11.708
Well, don't look so shocked.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.746
I thought you'd be upset.

03:14.748 --> 03:17.708
James, I'm your grandmother,
not your gaoler.

03:18.788 --> 03:20.146
I'm not sure for how long.

03:20.148 --> 03:23.748
As long as is necessary.
Whatever helps your marriage.

03:24.748 --> 03:29.466
A word of warning, though.
There is more temptation in the city.

03:29.468 --> 03:31.108
For my kind?

03:32.908 --> 03:34.628
That won't be a problem.

03:37.348 --> 03:39.748
Thank you.
Oh...

03:43.908 --> 03:46.546
I'm gonna seek professional help
while I'm there.

03:46.548 --> 03:49.706
There are doctors
for that sort of thing.

03:49.708 --> 03:53.626
I'm gonna change. Whatever it takes.

03:53.628 --> 03:56.266
I'm very proud of you.

03:56.268 --> 04:00.988
You've given me hope for this family
at a time when I so badly need it.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.746
Well, go and pack.

04:05.748 --> 04:09.268
A decision like this,
once taken, is best acted upon.

04:24.948 --> 04:27.146
She almost seemed glad.

04:27.148 --> 04:30.226
With her health, it may be a relief.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.348
All that time wasted worrying.

04:34.268 --> 04:37.706
Can I leave that to you? I've got
some things I have to attend to.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.188
Don't be long.

04:40.228 --> 04:42.028
Quick as I can.

04:46.868 --> 04:48.386
A new beginning.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.108
It is.

04:56.028 --> 04:57.826
I'll be here till seven.

04:57.828 --> 05:01.106
I'll pick you up.
We'll spend the night at the cottage.

05:01.108 --> 05:04.226
I'd love that.
We can discuss the implications.

05:04.228 --> 05:06.588
Tonight's for romance.

05:08.388 --> 05:09.628
Who cares?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.466
I love you.

05:22.468 --> 05:24.228
I love you too.

05:29.188 --> 05:32.188
I'll keep it to myself
until you've told the family.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.226
Sister,
Eve Walker's ready for discharge.

05:38.228 --> 05:39.946
He kissed you?

05:39.948 --> 05:41.708
He did.

05:58.148 --> 06:00.308
Everything feels so strange.

06:01.908 --> 06:05.786
You've found a mother
and you're becoming one yourself.

06:05.788 --> 06:08.388
It'd be strange if it didn't.

06:12.948 --> 06:15.106
So, what now?

06:15.108 --> 06:17.066
Home.

06:17.068 --> 06:19.266
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need.

06:19.268 --> 06:20.948
Gino will be worried.

06:22.468 --> 06:24.106
Any way I can help.

06:24.108 --> 06:25.588
Thank you.

06:26.348 --> 06:28.228
Anna...

06:30.628 --> 06:33.986
Our situation is a complication
you don't need in the mix.

06:33.988 --> 06:37.506
Not yet. One thing at a time.

06:37.508 --> 06:39.586
I have to tell Gino.

06:39.588 --> 06:43.906
Of course, but I won't be offended
if you wait to tell the family.

06:43.908 --> 06:49.068
And when it is time, I will support
you in whatever way is best for you.

06:51.028 --> 06:52.748
You're wonderful.

06:54.308 --> 06:56.508
And you're my brave girl.

07:02.108 --> 07:03.628
I'll pack.

07:08.748 --> 07:11.546
George, she won't say
what's happening,

07:11.548 --> 07:13.346
but something is, clearly.

07:13.348 --> 07:16.226
I'm here to help, remember.
Both of you.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.988
She needs you more. I have Sarah.

07:31.468 --> 07:32.868
Whose bags?

07:33.868 --> 07:37.826
James and Olivia have decided
to spend some time in Sydney.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.626
Because of us?

07:39.628 --> 07:42.346
It's best for the baby.

07:42.348 --> 07:45.626
Have you told them?
No. And I would rather you didn't.

07:45.628 --> 07:47.866
You just threatened
to disinherit me.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.988
Which we can discuss later.
Amongst other things.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.188
George.

07:58.628 --> 08:01.826
Matters are getting out of hand.

08:01.828 --> 08:05.508
I am going to try to be more...
constructive.

08:07.268 --> 08:09.266
Just so you know what we will
be discussing,

08:09.268 --> 08:13.906
I've just proposed to Sarah
and she's accepted.

08:13.908 --> 08:16.228
Try and be constructive about that.

08:20.348 --> 08:22.186
I've ordered the taxi.

08:22.188 --> 08:24.826
And I'm pouring you a stiff one
to get you through the journey.

08:24.828 --> 08:26.666
If a girl's got to be covered in
soot,

08:26.668 --> 08:28.748
she needs to soften the edges.

08:31.308 --> 08:33.308
It won't stop.

08:40.508 --> 08:44.145
You can't marry him.
You don't need him. I'll help out.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.748
I love him.
You heard her. Now go.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.588
Please, you're just making it worse.

08:54.948 --> 08:57.986
And you can take your Bligh bullshit
and piss off!

08:57.988 --> 08:59.428
I just came for my tools.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.108
Then you can take her with you too.

09:20.228 --> 09:22.268
My wife and I are moving to Sydney.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.908
How long?

09:26.908 --> 09:29.306
I'm not sure.

09:29.308 --> 09:33.348
You asked me if I still felt...

09:35.708 --> 09:39.428
you know... if it...
if it was still there.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.746
I owe you the truth.

09:43.748 --> 09:45.468
It is still there?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.466
I lied.

09:49.468 --> 09:50.948
Why?

09:51.668 --> 09:54.508
Some things are easier resisted
if they're denied.

09:55.788 --> 10:00.546
But I made you feel like you're
a freak, and that you're alone,

10:00.548 --> 10:03.546
and that's not true.

10:03.548 --> 10:08.066
If you can't find a way to proceed,
a woman to love,

10:08.068 --> 10:11.508
then I hope that you can find...

10:13.188 --> 10:15.748
someone to love.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.068
Can I kiss you?

10:27.308 --> 10:29.028
Please.

10:35.388 --> 10:37.388
At least the memory.

10:42.028 --> 10:43.628
Just one.

10:57.748 --> 10:59.268
No.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.125
The baby's gone.

11:24.127 --> 11:25.827
The ambulance will take her
to the hospital

11:25.925 --> 11:28.345
for dilation and curettage.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.496
She'll be in overnight.

11:30.498 --> 11:32.258
Thank you.

11:42.378 --> 11:45.338
All I wanted was to lose it.

11:48.498 --> 11:51.258
Why do I feel so...?

11:52.307 --> 11:53.827
Shh.

11:54.907 --> 11:58.947
Our love made it and it's gone.

12:11.627 --> 12:12.465
Come on, get up!

12:12.467 --> 12:14.427
Come on, you pervert!

12:18.027 --> 12:21.027
Come on. Come on, you pervert!

12:22.907 --> 12:25.545
Come on! Come on, fight back!

12:25.547 --> 12:27.107
Hit me!

12:48.907 --> 12:51.745
I'm just going to have a moment
with your grandmother.

12:51.747 --> 12:54.027
I think she'd appreciate that.

12:55.467 --> 12:56.987
I'll meet you at the car.

12:59.827 --> 13:01.825
You are sure about this?

13:01.827 --> 13:03.985
Absolutely.

13:03.987 --> 13:06.265
Something's changed.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.107
It's not cold feet.

13:22.907 --> 13:25.147
Amy, come here a moment.

13:28.467 --> 13:30.185
As awful as it is

13:30.187 --> 13:33.427
thinking of your sister and nephew
living with that brute...

13:35.907 --> 13:38.867
I am very glad
to have you back home.

13:40.707 --> 13:42.867
It's good to be here, Mrs Bligh.

13:43.987 --> 13:45.627
Best get to it.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.185
We'll miss you, ma'am.

13:49.187 --> 13:50.625
Thank you, Amy.

13:50.627 --> 13:53.025
Amy, would you ask cook
to come and see me about dinner?

13:53.027 --> 13:54.587
We may have a guest.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.747
I've come to say goodbye.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.427
I hoped you would.

14:03.747 --> 14:07.547
You understand
why we're leaving?

14:09.467 --> 14:13.147
Because you find living with me
so intolerable.

14:14.227 --> 14:19.187
It is what it is
and you cannot be but what you are.

14:21.627 --> 14:26.467
I would like my great-grandchild
to be born here.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.825
Then we will return for that.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.865
Thank you.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.387
Whether we stay...

14:37.667 --> 14:40.667
I hope one day things are different.

14:41.987 --> 14:45.065
Oh, I see so much of myself in you.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.387
So do I.

15:01.947 --> 15:03.547
Let me help you outside?

15:10.827 --> 15:14.827
I thought I married James to someone
too weak to be a threat.

15:16.427 --> 15:19.907
But I married him to someone with
a strength that may yet save him.

15:21.187 --> 15:24.825
You're sure?
If you love her, be with her.

15:24.827 --> 15:27.705
What else matters?
Ah, that means the world to me.

15:27.707 --> 15:30.305
Anna will feel the same.
Marry her, Dad.

15:30.307 --> 15:32.305
It'll start a war.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.745
Well, as long as it makes you
feel happy.

15:34.747 --> 15:37.347
Grandmother will have to accept it
eventually.

15:40.827 --> 15:43.587
There you are.

15:45.747 --> 15:48.105
If there are any doors
you need opened in the city,

15:48.107 --> 15:50.465
I have just as many keys
as your father.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.345
It's been wonderful
seeing you again, Reggie.

15:52.347 --> 15:53.905
Will you be looking for employment?

15:53.907 --> 15:55.545
I'm considering all options.

15:55.547 --> 15:58.425
Grandmother.
You take it slowly.

15:58.427 --> 15:59.545
Oh, don't lecture, George.

15:59.547 --> 16:02.587
Olivia and I have had
a lovely farewell.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.265
Thank you.

16:09.267 --> 16:10.825
Come.

16:10.827 --> 16:13.987
I meant what I said.
I'm so proud of you.

16:16.627 --> 16:19.467
I'll be rid of it, any way I can.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.267
Ready?

16:30.787 --> 16:32.707
Safe travels.

16:33.907 --> 16:37.547
They look happier already.
And may that continue.

16:39.627 --> 16:41.105
Uh, Reggie, I think

16:41.107 --> 16:43.265
a tray in your room for dinner.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.905
I'm hoping Miss Adams
will join us tonight.

16:45.907 --> 16:47.465
I beg your pardon?

16:47.467 --> 16:49.505
Well, we said we'd talk
once the children had left

16:49.507 --> 16:51.025
and I think she should be here.

16:51.027 --> 16:52.545
For dinner?

16:52.547 --> 16:55.025
You have been pressuring me about it
since she arrived.

16:55.027 --> 16:56.505
Well, we've made
other arrangements.

16:56.507 --> 17:00.105
Well, I hope to put this
unpleasantness behind us

17:00.107 --> 17:02.145
and I believe the only way to do that

17:02.147 --> 17:05.345
is for the three of us to sit down
and face matters frankly -

17:05.347 --> 17:08.146
a constructive effort.

17:10.186 --> 17:11.946
I'll see what I can do.

17:17.627 --> 17:19.704
Dealing that new hand?

17:19.707 --> 17:22.507
I'm changing the whole deck.

17:29.747 --> 17:32.467
Go on, get out of here.

17:35.427 --> 17:36.987
Look at you.
Well, it's disgusting.

17:41.307 --> 17:43.905
It's how I was born.
No-one's born filth.

17:43.907 --> 17:47.107
You were.
Please. Just go.

17:48.827 --> 17:51.027
You have to understand -
I can't have you around Colin.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.707
Maybe you do deserve him.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.907
You're lucky to be alive.

18:10.347 --> 18:12.107
No-one can ever know.

18:20.547 --> 18:22.065
Just the three of us?

18:22.067 --> 18:26.547
No, please don't. I'm sure Roy
won't mind giving me a lift.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.987
7:30. So much for romance.

18:32.347 --> 18:33.907
'Bye.

18:36.787 --> 18:39.905
Dinner at Ash Park.
Elizabeth's invitation.

18:39.907 --> 18:42.265
Right. What brought this on?

18:42.267 --> 18:44.265
I can't say. Not yet.

18:44.267 --> 18:47.105
Anything to do with the gossip
amongst the nurses?

18:47.107 --> 18:48.825
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.705
Right. Well, I'd wear a flak jacket.

18:51.707 --> 18:53.267
You got a spare?

19:16.587 --> 19:19.105
Can't beat arriving in style, I say.

19:19.107 --> 19:21.467
Well, at least the driveway
wasn't mined.

19:23.227 --> 19:24.707
Here. Hold your horses.

19:31.667 --> 19:34.185
Can't have anyone thinking
you're just pretending to be posh.

19:34.187 --> 19:36.145
As if anyone would ever think that.

19:36.147 --> 19:38.187
In that frock,
you could fool the world.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.747
Don't let her
get away with anything.

19:43.907 --> 19:47.467
I forgot who
I was talking to there for a moment.

19:58.124 --> 20:00.802
I trust Eve Walker
has made a complete recovery.

20:00.804 --> 20:03.402
Well, she'll have to be careful
for some time.

20:03.404 --> 20:05.124
Hmm. Do, please, begin.

20:06.084 --> 20:08.882
You'll be seeing her on your rounds,
I imagine?

20:08.884 --> 20:11.604
As long as it doesn't cause
too much trouble for her.

20:13.364 --> 20:14.882
Bert Ford.

20:14.884 --> 20:18.882
Ah, yes. Every community
has one of those.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.322
Mother. We're not here
to discuss the Walkers.

20:22.324 --> 20:24.482
The norm at mealtimes, George,

20:24.484 --> 20:27.204
is that one avoids topics
which may cause indigestion.

20:28.764 --> 20:31.164
So no Bert Ford either,
on that basis.

20:40.164 --> 20:43.842
London? What do you miss about it?

20:43.844 --> 20:46.042
Oh, certainly not the smog.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.644
Indeed.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.964
Our own private world. Heaven.

21:21.204 --> 21:23.962
Reality will sneak in soon enough.

21:23.964 --> 21:25.684
But not yet.

21:31.284 --> 21:33.842
I wish I'd come to know Sarah
better now.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.842
You'll have plenty of opportunity
for that, I imagine.

21:36.844 --> 21:38.762
Not if your grandmother
has her way.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.922
She won't.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.122
Father's determined
to blow the doors off the hinges

21:42.124 --> 21:43.642
and let the world in.

21:43.644 --> 21:46.324
And this family needs it.

21:47.884 --> 21:50.562
Your daddy is turning
into an anarchist.

21:50.564 --> 21:53.242
We're stuck in
some sort of Edwardian aspic

21:53.244 --> 21:55.244
while the country changes around us.

21:57.324 --> 21:58.842
What?

21:58.844 --> 22:02.562
Your turn of phrase.
You'd make a very good politician.

22:02.564 --> 22:06.964
Maybe I would.
I've thought about it.

22:08.524 --> 22:12.044
Which gives me all the more reason
to do what I intend to.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.162
You could work here.

22:19.164 --> 22:21.482
I can't.

22:21.484 --> 22:25.604
What did you do that was so terrible?
And why can't you tell me?

22:28.724 --> 22:31.164
Don't hate me when they tell you.

22:32.124 --> 22:36.244
I'm not blind. Or stupid.

22:39.204 --> 22:40.642
You're not disgusted?

22:40.644 --> 22:43.642
Bert disgusts me.

22:43.644 --> 22:46.042
Hate disgusts me.

22:46.044 --> 22:47.962
Not you.

22:47.964 --> 22:52.042
It puzzles me, and saddens me, but...

22:52.044 --> 22:54.364
I never thought...

23:05.044 --> 23:09.084
I'm just worried you'll end up
sad and lonely with no-one.

23:11.844 --> 23:14.964
Reckon the world's stitched up
my kind on that one.

23:53.564 --> 23:55.362
Olivia's unwell?

23:55.364 --> 23:57.042
Unsettled.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.922
It's more she's anxious
about the baby.

23:58.924 --> 24:00.682
I'd rather not elaborate.

24:00.684 --> 24:02.602
Of course.

24:02.604 --> 24:05.122
It's why we've come
to town, actually.

24:05.124 --> 24:07.842
Don't tell Anna.
I don't want her worrying.

24:07.844 --> 24:10.482
She's off with,
uh, Swanson, I presume?

24:10.484 --> 24:12.244
Yes.

24:13.204 --> 24:15.684
A GP for Olivia,
or were you after a specialist?

24:17.204 --> 24:19.282
A psychiatrist, I think.

24:19.284 --> 24:21.042
Do you know any...

24:21.044 --> 24:24.404
I know...
..preferably, um... progressive.

24:26.244 --> 24:28.924
It sounds a lot more than anxiety.

24:31.324 --> 24:35.764
But it's none of my affair.
I'll get you a name.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.962
By the way,

24:39.964 --> 24:41.922
Father is in the process
of supplanting you

24:41.924 --> 24:43.764
as the black sheep of the family.

24:48.204 --> 24:49.844
Thank you, George.

24:53.684 --> 24:56.042
Offley 1881.

24:56.044 --> 24:58.282
A particular favourite
of my husband's.

24:58.284 --> 25:00.842
He laid down
a number of cases after our wedding.

25:00.844 --> 25:02.484
Over 70 years old.
Mmm.

25:04.084 --> 25:06.564
The sun shone on these grapes
before even I was born.

25:08.204 --> 25:12.682
So the manipulative matriarch
and the scheming Jewess...

25:12.684 --> 25:13.962
Mother!

25:13.964 --> 25:15.882
Have managed a civilised dinner,

25:15.884 --> 25:19.682
and, dare I say it,
even enjoyed each other's company.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.282
George, where's
your sense of humour?

25:21.284 --> 25:23.084
Fast losing it.

25:25.484 --> 25:29.642
I hope this demonstrates that we're
not natural enemies, Miss Adams.

25:29.644 --> 25:31.604
Was that its purpose?

25:32.284 --> 25:36.962
We have all fallen into assigned
roles in this little melodrama.

25:36.964 --> 25:39.362
And I felt it important
to put those aside

25:39.364 --> 25:41.722
so that we could discuss
your relationship frankly

25:41.724 --> 25:43.244
and dispassionately.

25:44.484 --> 25:47.682
Well, I certainly feel more relaxed.
Good.

25:47.684 --> 25:50.122
Then we can strike out into
more dangerous territory

25:50.124 --> 25:51.724
a little less defensively.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.604
This won't take long.

25:56.484 --> 25:58.924
George, I loved like you, once.

25:59.924 --> 26:02.284
Inappropriately.

26:03.284 --> 26:04.884
Deeply.

26:09.724 --> 26:12.524
After your father and I were married.
Before you.

26:13.524 --> 26:17.802
I could have created a scandal
and followed my heart.

26:17.804 --> 26:20.842
But had I, you'd never have been born

26:20.844 --> 26:25.202
and I would be
an aged dirt farmer's wife

26:25.204 --> 26:28.764
living the dog days
of a life of regret.

26:30.684 --> 26:32.604
You're shocked?

26:34.044 --> 26:35.564
Yes.

26:37.284 --> 26:41.562
I tell you this so that you
understand I ask nothing of you

26:41.564 --> 26:43.482
that I haven't given myself,

26:43.484 --> 26:46.364
or, indeed, that James gave in
London.

26:47.324 --> 26:49.122
Which is why

26:49.124 --> 26:52.562
Ash Park will go to him

26:52.564 --> 26:56.884
if you insist on this mismatch.

26:58.964 --> 27:02.644
That is an absolute.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.244
Goodnight, Miss Adams.

27:09.364 --> 27:11.964
I'll help you to your room.
Thank you.

27:17.284 --> 27:19.124
Goodnight, Mrs Bligh.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.684
I'll wait for you outside.

27:36.324 --> 27:39.924
So you're happy to drag him down
to your level?

27:41.924 --> 27:44.724
Because you'll never be accepted
on his.

27:46.484 --> 27:48.282
Unlike you?

27:48.284 --> 27:52.924
He should have been mine -
from the first day we met.

27:58.724 --> 28:01.202
I will see you gone.

28:01.204 --> 28:03.044
Whatever it takes.

28:05.204 --> 28:08.722
I've faced far worse than you.
And here I am.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.802
Yes.

28:10.804 --> 28:13.244
Sadly.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.682
You know what Hitler got wrong?

28:19.684 --> 28:23.082
He ran out of steam before
he'd finished you all off.

28:23.084 --> 28:25.284
Sorry, gassed.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.600
I'm sorry if Mother upset you.
No. No, I'm fine.

29:16.200 --> 29:19.560
It's the first I'd heard of her
nearly leaving my father.

29:20.339 --> 29:21.817
It doesn't surprise me.

29:21.819 --> 29:24.819
There was always something missing
between them.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.019
I'd understand
if it's too much of a sacrifice.

29:32.579 --> 29:34.297
I love you for that.

29:34.299 --> 29:36.377
But it's all
going to James eventually.

29:36.379 --> 29:38.417
So what if it skips
a generation?

29:38.419 --> 29:41.057
It's so much of who you are.
It's a house and some land.

29:41.059 --> 29:44.859
It's your home.
We'll build a new home.

29:48.899 --> 29:51.219
Something I bought while I was
up at the wool sales.

29:52.819 --> 29:56.459
Proof that I always intended
to propose.

30:00.539 --> 30:02.219
You're certain?

30:06.219 --> 30:08.659
Even more so.

30:48.939 --> 30:50.699
Good morning, Lucky.

30:53.659 --> 30:55.779
Oh! Oh! Careful!

30:57.099 --> 30:59.059
I guess that means he approves.

31:01.779 --> 31:03.257
Do you?

31:03.259 --> 31:05.857
Hope I don't have to lick your hand
to prove it.

31:05.859 --> 31:07.379
Preferably not.

31:11.459 --> 31:13.059
What?

31:17.339 --> 31:20.937
Me and the missus only had
the two boys, so...

31:20.939 --> 31:25.979
I'm not much use
to giving fatherly advice to...

31:28.899 --> 31:31.977
But I just hope you're not biting
off more than you can chew.

31:31.979 --> 31:34.619
George is a good man.
I'm not talking about George.

31:35.579 --> 31:37.417
I can handle what comes with it.

31:37.419 --> 31:40.459
Even that old girl?
Especially that old girl.

31:42.179 --> 31:46.139
Well, if it makes sense to you,
it makes sense to me.

31:47.779 --> 31:49.459
Good on ya, missy!

32:29.939 --> 32:32.099
Hey, Col.

32:35.739 --> 32:39.659
So you remember what to say,
if anyone asks.

32:41.619 --> 32:44.017
Hey, you want me to be nice
to your ma, right?

32:44.019 --> 32:46.137
Yeah.

32:46.139 --> 32:49.539
Yeah. Shake.

32:55.699 --> 32:57.739
Least there's one man in the family.

33:02.699 --> 33:05.697
Can I get you something?
Food? Drink?

33:05.699 --> 33:07.179
No.

33:10.539 --> 33:14.697
This makes everything
a lot less complicated.

33:14.699 --> 33:16.977
It's as though it never happened.

33:16.979 --> 33:20.057
I might never have told you
about us if not for this.

33:20.059 --> 33:22.139
It happened.

33:24.299 --> 33:26.897
I want to go home.

33:26.899 --> 33:28.819
You think you're up to it?

33:29.899 --> 33:32.379
What if he doesn't believe me?

33:33.499 --> 33:35.897
It seems so convenient.

33:35.899 --> 33:38.819
He'll think you've had an abortion?

33:40.099 --> 33:42.177
It's all I could think about
last night.

33:42.179 --> 33:43.539
Oh!

33:44.819 --> 33:49.379
If he doesn't believe you,
he doesn't deserve you.

33:54.739 --> 33:56.737
And that is final?

33:56.739 --> 33:58.139
Yes.

33:59.459 --> 34:03.337
If she truly loved you, she would not
make you give up your inheritance.

34:03.339 --> 34:04.977
You made me choose, Mother.

34:04.979 --> 34:07.339
We'll discuss the details
another time.

34:12.099 --> 34:16.257
Must you sneak around like
a character in a penny dreadful?

34:16.259 --> 34:18.339
I didn't mean to intrude.

34:20.418 --> 34:22.539
I've come to make an offer.

34:23.938 --> 34:27.817
I caught a glimpse last night
into the true nature of Sarah Adams.

34:27.819 --> 34:30.056
I saw a very dangerous woman.

34:30.059 --> 34:32.259
I am well aware
of how dangerous she is.

34:33.699 --> 34:37.458
I mean physically dangerous,
capable of real physical harm.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.496
You've told me how little
you know about her.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.059
Does George know the real truth?

34:44.059 --> 34:47.496
A Jew who lived
through the war in Europe?

34:47.498 --> 34:49.697
Who knows what lengths
she went to to survive?

34:49.699 --> 34:50.976
Go on.

34:50.978 --> 34:54.417
I have excellent access to records
through old embassy contacts,

34:54.418 --> 34:56.937
and to less formal modes
of investigation.

34:56.938 --> 34:58.577
I'd go across.

34:58.579 --> 35:00.697
You would do that?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.337
With pleasure.

35:02.339 --> 35:04.457
If there are secrets
to bring her undone,

35:04.459 --> 35:07.259
I'm convinced
that's where we'll find them.

35:08.419 --> 35:10.937
I don't care what it costs.

35:10.939 --> 35:14.939
Find something that will
rid us of her forever.

35:16.979 --> 35:19.099
Oh, the best man won.

35:20.779 --> 35:22.337
If I'm not jumping for joy

35:22.339 --> 35:25.457
it's because I'm about to lose
one of my best nurses, that's all.

35:25.459 --> 35:28.057
Why would you think that?

35:28.059 --> 35:31.459
Oh, Mrs George Bligh doesn't work.
This Mrs George Bligh will.

35:32.619 --> 35:34.457
We're a rather unlikely couple.

35:34.459 --> 35:36.857
We won't be proceeding
in any likely way.

35:36.859 --> 35:38.337
You make it sound easy.

35:38.339 --> 35:42.297
Of course it won't be,
but we're happy when we're together.

35:42.299 --> 35:44.339
We'll just have to fight
to keep that.

35:52.259 --> 35:54.977
What did Freud say
about being too neat?

35:54.979 --> 35:57.459
First impressions count.

35:59.139 --> 36:01.939
You're sure about this?

36:05.219 --> 36:07.419
There's something I haven't told you.

36:11.099 --> 36:13.619
I tried to kill myself
because of this.

36:15.819 --> 36:18.619
In despair. On the ship.

36:21.139 --> 36:25.099
And I've thought about doing it
a number of times since.

36:26.059 --> 36:30.459
But it's you and the baby
that made me want to live.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.297
I'm so sorry.

36:36.299 --> 36:38.739
Oh, James.

36:43.899 --> 36:46.177
I'll get it out of me,

36:46.179 --> 36:48.619
even if he has to cut it out.

36:53.419 --> 36:56.857
George. I've kept
out of your way deliberately.

36:56.859 --> 36:58.697
I know you've had a lot
to deal with.

36:58.699 --> 37:01.739
But I do hear
congratulations are in order.

37:03.139 --> 37:04.937
Thank you.
Not from your mother.

37:04.939 --> 37:07.617
Which can't have surprised.
I was hoping, but...

37:07.619 --> 37:09.537
Ah, yes, 'hope'.

37:09.539 --> 37:12.057
Naught but a waking dream.

37:12.059 --> 37:14.817
It is wonderful
that you're ready to start again.

37:14.819 --> 37:17.137
I'm sure one day
you'll be able to as well.

37:17.139 --> 37:21.057
Soon, I trust. Perhaps it's a good
thing I've been called away.

37:21.059 --> 37:22.777
You're leaving?
Tomorrow.

37:22.779 --> 37:25.697
Elizabeth feels she can manage.
Well, you'll be missed.

37:25.699 --> 37:28.217
You don't have to say that.
It's true.

37:28.219 --> 37:31.697
I'm not blind to the fact
your fiancee hasn't taken to me.

37:31.699 --> 37:33.497
You got off to a bad start.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.217
Well, perhaps when I return

37:35.219 --> 37:39.257
I can convince her that I'm not
the anti-Semite she thinks I am.

37:39.259 --> 37:40.777
We'll see you at the wedding.

37:40.779 --> 37:42.259
Wonderful.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.217
Mr Bligh.
You're wanted at the back door.

37:47.219 --> 37:48.697
Who is it?

37:48.699 --> 37:51.179
I tried to get him to go away,
but he wouldn't listen.

37:54.499 --> 37:56.617
What do you want?

37:56.619 --> 37:58.137
What's it worth to you

37:58.139 --> 38:01.099
for the world not to find out
that your son's a queer?

38:05.392 --> 38:07.210
You don't wanna do this.
Get off my property!

38:07.212 --> 38:08.972
You'll be sorry.
I'm calling the police.

38:09.065 --> 38:12.425
Go on, call them. Only person
doing anything illegal's your son.

38:12.519 --> 38:13.999
Or maybe you want them to find out,

38:14.096 --> 38:16.696
knowing how much he's gonna enjoy
taking it in the slammer.

38:17.936 --> 38:20.094
You think you can make up
some cock and bull story

38:20.096 --> 38:21.574
and I'm going to open my wallet?

38:21.576 --> 38:23.974
I ain't making...
He's a married man!

38:23.976 --> 38:26.656
Who's gonna believe
a piece of filth like you anyway?

38:29.456 --> 38:31.336
Get off my property.

38:32.536 --> 38:34.376
What about Colin?

38:35.896 --> 38:38.054
It was him that saw it.

38:38.056 --> 38:41.014
Poor kid his age
having to watch perverts at it.

38:41.016 --> 38:43.136
You reckon they'll believe him?

38:44.816 --> 38:47.254
You think you're so good
sitting up here at Cash Park,

38:47.256 --> 38:49.934
peering down your nose
at the rest of us,

38:49.936 --> 38:52.494
but it ain't us fooling round
with the station hand.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.976
Nah, it's your fairy son...

39:02.776 --> 39:04.856
Get off my property!

39:08.296 --> 39:11.576
I reckon a thousand quid
should be about right.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.776
See you tomorrow.

39:26.576 --> 39:28.176
What happened in England?

39:29.936 --> 39:31.936
Why did James
try to jump off the ship?

39:33.336 --> 39:36.016
Do we have to drag this all...
What happened?!

39:37.256 --> 39:39.054
You know what happened.

39:39.056 --> 39:41.096
Was it the truth?

39:42.696 --> 39:44.296
Mother!
Yes.

39:45.376 --> 39:48.254
It wasn't an unsuitable woman,
was it?

39:48.256 --> 39:50.016
It all makes sense suddenly.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.976
His rush to marry,
his attempted suicide.

39:55.336 --> 39:57.814
My son is a pervert.
No!

39:57.816 --> 40:00.414
He's been seen with Harry Polson.
Oh, God.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.214
By a child.

40:02.216 --> 40:05.494
Accusations have been made, Mother.
We're being blackmailed!

40:05.496 --> 40:07.094
I was only trying
to protect you both.

40:07.096 --> 40:09.014
No. No!
George...

40:09.016 --> 40:10.774
Stop!
Please!

40:10.776 --> 40:12.774
Stop! Stop!

40:12.776 --> 40:14.056
Just STOP!

40:19.216 --> 40:21.136
Did Sarah know?

40:23.496 --> 40:25.334
I thought I'd controlled it.

40:25.336 --> 40:26.856
You're wrong.

40:31.416 --> 40:33.416
Oh, God.

40:37.176 --> 40:39.694
Look at those diamonds
and sapphires!

40:39.696 --> 40:41.254
Where did he get it?
Hardy Brothers?

40:41.256 --> 40:42.734
Maybe Prouds even.

40:42.736 --> 40:45.214
Oh! You have to get Monte Luke
to take your photographs.

40:45.216 --> 40:46.974
He does all the society folk...

40:46.976 --> 40:48.734
We've only been engaged
for five minutes.

40:48.736 --> 40:51.094
It's just so exciting!
Whoever would have thought?

40:51.096 --> 40:55.296
Sister Adams and Mr Bligh
living happily ever after!

41:11.776 --> 41:14.374
Elizabeth?

41:14.376 --> 41:18.014
What have I done?
What have I done?

41:18.016 --> 41:19.814
What have I done?
Hey, hey.

41:19.816 --> 41:21.536
What's happened?

41:25.896 --> 41:31.014
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done? What have I done?

41:31.016 --> 41:33.216
Oh!

41:33.405 --> 42:51.307
