00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.567
The Geordies are back...

00:11.633 --> 00:13.167
Hello!

00:13.233 --> 00:17.233
...doing the things we love,
but this time...

00:17.300 --> 00:20.033
...man's gonna mix things right
up.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.700
(knock at door)
Oh! Newbies!

00:26.767 --> 00:30.100
Oh, my God!
Gonna be fucking mint.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.800
Anna's given the Geordie squad
and naughty facelift.

00:34.867 --> 00:37.167
I love a bit change, me...

00:37.233 --> 00:40.967
...but some things never change.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.433
I love this family!

00:45.500 --> 00:46.833
(rings bell)

00:46.900 --> 00:48.667
Ding fucking ding, you dicks.

00:48.733 --> 00:49.867
(all cheer)

00:49.933 --> 00:52.133
Take it all in, bitch.

00:55.167 --> 00:59.633
Isn't my usual type but he's got
good crack and I fancy a
neck-on.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.467
Pack your shit.
You're going to fucking Cardiff.

01:02.533 --> 01:05.233
Buzzing to get to Cardiff.
Brother lives there.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.600
Why don't we stay the night?

01:07.667 --> 01:11.833
That's a very good idea. If Anna
kicks off, she's getting the
blame.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.767
I'm in a relationship.
I wouldn't say it's serious.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.133
I wanna take it slow.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.433
I can't believe that
I've read this so wrong.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.067
Beau clearly hasn't caught
feelings
the way I have.

01:27.133 --> 01:29.867
Harvey is huge.

01:29.933 --> 01:34.867
We need to get back before Anna
finds out we're not in our beds.

01:34.933 --> 01:38.033
Goodnight, everybody! Goodnight!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.700
I'm preened to perfection.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.767
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.767
As much cheek as
a girl with fillers.

01:46.833 --> 01:50.133
Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy -
I'm all over the place.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.933
I'm that good-looking
I'd even neck on meself.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.833
I can talk
the back legs off a donkey.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.100
I might dance like a grandad
but I'm proper radge.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.500
Fit, flirty and I've got double
Fs.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.667
I don't go on the pull.
Girls love guns.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.133
Might look rough and ready
but I'm a massive softie.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.300
I can't believe anyone
would put me in charge.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.433
(all) Geordie Shore! Why aye!

02:26.467 --> 02:29.367
Is anyone up?
Yeah. Just about.

02:29.433 --> 02:34.033
Anna is gonna be so pissed off
when she finds out we stayed.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.000
We had a wicked bonus night out
in Cardiff.

02:37.067 --> 02:40.600
We travelled home all night
and we were knackered.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.200
I hope that nap has sorted us
out.

02:43.267 --> 02:46.700
Enjoyed my time in Wales.
Your brother did as well.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.500
He had a lotta fun.

02:48.567 --> 02:51.400
Watching Tahlia, I thought,
"I wish that was me."

02:51.467 --> 02:54.300
Who's your type, Beau or the
brother?
Beau.

02:54.367 --> 02:58.067
He's like the pound shop version
of Harvey.

02:58.133 --> 03:01.200
What did you and Bethan talk
about?

03:01.267 --> 03:04.200
Make sure we're on the same
page.
Which is?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.967
Going casual. Taking it steady.

03:06.033 --> 03:10.700
I'm really glad me and Bethan
had
that chat. I just hope she's
honest.

03:10.767 --> 03:15.100
Girls play it down
so they don't scare the guy
away.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.033
Appreciate the advice
but we're on the same wavelength

03:18.100 --> 03:21.933
so everyone should back of,
let me do what I'm gonna do.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.067
You can't say fairer than that.

03:28.033 --> 03:31.433
Belter idea, suggesting we stay.
I'm quite clever, you know.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.567
Until fucking Anna finds out.
(farts) Pardon.

03:34.633 --> 03:37.500
I'm pure shitting meself
in case Anna finds out.

03:37.567 --> 03:40.233
It's all right
cos everyone was on board.

03:40.300 --> 03:44.100
How do you feel about Harvey?
Very tall, dark and handsome.

03:44.167 --> 03:48.833
Love how big and strong Harvey
is.
Like a princess, swept off me
feet.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.167
How is you and Beau?
Had a conversation, right?

03:52.233 --> 03:55.667
We both wanna
carry on the way we're going

03:55.733 --> 03:58.433
and everyone's been, like,
"Oh, a relationship."

03:58.500 --> 04:01.033
It's gonna proper fucking
scare him off.

04:01.100 --> 04:06.233
Beth and Beau are gonna have to
decide if they want a label on
it.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.900
Does anybody want bacon?

04:12.967 --> 04:17.600
I'm starving and nothing is
gonna
sort me out like a Geordie
fry-up.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.700
(all) Ooh!

04:19.767 --> 04:20.800
(phone rings)

04:20.867 --> 04:23.700
Ooh! I got it!
(Chloe) What if it's Anna?

04:23.767 --> 04:27.867
It can't be Anna Surely, she
doesn't
know what we did already.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.533
Hi, Nathan.
How are you?

04:29.600 --> 04:33.900
You spent an extra night in
Cardiff.
We did. I'm not gonna lie.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.033
It was Chloe's idea, Chloe's
fault.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.600
I am really disappointed.
He just grasses like a rat!

04:39.667 --> 04:42.367
As punishment,
you can all stay in tonight

04:42.433 --> 04:46.767
and as it was Chloe's bright
idea,
she can clean the bus.

04:46.833 --> 04:47.867
Right. OK.

04:47.933 --> 04:51.833
And another thing. You and Chloe
have got a big job tomorrow.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.633
You better not let me down.
OK, Anna.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.733
We obviously
will do everything we can for
you.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.000
Bye, Nathan.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.633
Can't believe
we gotta clean this bastard bus

05:03.700 --> 05:06.767
and a mysterious,
stinking job to do tomorrow.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.067
Anna's getting stricter
in her old age.

05:10.500 --> 05:15.200
So Anna said, as punishment,
you've gotta clean the bus.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.800
For real? Me cleaning?

05:16.867 --> 05:20.967
I'm the only does any cleaning.
You know she's gonna pick me.

05:21.033 --> 05:24.267
For you dropping us in it,
you can help us

05:24.333 --> 05:27.600
so you can help us
and you can help me!

05:27.667 --> 05:28.900
Ah.

05:28.967 --> 05:33.700
Anna did say take it easy
cos you and me have a big job.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.167
Wonder what that is.

05:35.233 --> 05:39.400
The family's getting along so
well,
we're in a good place

05:39.467 --> 05:43.233
so why don't we invite friends
and have a house party?

05:43.300 --> 05:47.033
Not going out?
We'll just bring the fun to us.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.567
Why don't we have Desert Divas?
(all) Yeah!

05:50.633 --> 05:54.267
Genies, explorers,
the full desert shebang.

05:54.333 --> 05:57.600
Of course Nathan would say
have a Desert Diva party.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.067
He's the biggest diva I've ever
met!

06:00.133 --> 06:03.067
Let's get ready.
We'll have sarnies after.

06:03.133 --> 06:06.033
Having friends and family there
is gonna be mint

06:06.100 --> 06:08.600
but I know Abbie's gonna be
there

06:08.667 --> 06:11.000
and it makes us really nervous.

06:18.467 --> 06:22.533
Whoa!
Nathan! Man! Watch out!

06:22.600 --> 06:25.400
I'm finding it therapeutic.
Thera-what?

06:25.467 --> 06:28.433
Thera-puke-tic!
Thera-puking! (laughs)

06:28.500 --> 06:31.400
I'm very excited, the party
tonight.
So am I.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.933
Abbie's gonna be there.
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.100
Last thing I want
is Bethan to be upset.

06:37.167 --> 06:41.267
Every time Abbie comes, Bethan
gets upset. Don't want that for
her.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.267
Want a good night, no arguments.

06:43.333 --> 06:47.933
Abbie hasn't done anything.
She's
single. It was Beau that fucked
up.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.067
Everyone needs to stop
putting the blame on Abbie.

06:51.133 --> 06:53.567
My loyalty is with Bethan.

06:53.633 --> 06:58.267
I understand where you're coming
from
but if they did come to blows

06:58.333 --> 07:01.267
my loyalty is with Abbie,
my best friend.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.733
15-love. Come on. This is 2-all.

07:10.367 --> 07:11.467
Oh!

07:11.533 --> 07:12.700
Oh!

07:12.767 --> 07:14.100
30-love.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.700
I am fucking freezing.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.933
(indistinct)

07:20.000 --> 07:23.200
The bus is clean.
Need to get the house ready.

07:23.267 --> 07:27.233
Come on, then. Move. Come on.
Where shall I put this?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.700
If anyone wants outfits, over
here.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.167
Chloe, stop!

07:33.233 --> 07:34.833
Way!

07:34.900 --> 07:38.533
We're decorating the house and
it's
starting to look absolutely
mental.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.733
Someone decorate near the door,
the rug needs to go, get the
candles.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.700
House is starting to come
together
but what's a party without
guests?

07:48.067 --> 07:52.167
We're gonna have a party.
Gonna make it the biggest one
yet.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.300
I suggest get in your car...

07:54.367 --> 07:58.600
I'm buzzing to see me brother
again
and me sister's coming.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.833
Happy fucking days.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.500
(phone rings)

08:03.500 --> 08:04.700
Hi, handsome.

08:04.767 --> 08:08.367
I haven't seen Cameron since
I was necking on in Powerhouse

08:08.433 --> 08:12.667
and I wouldn't mind seeing him
again
so I'm gonna invite him tonight.

08:12.733 --> 08:16.567
We're having a party tonight.
I would like it if you came.

08:19.700 --> 08:24.100
What?! I'm sorry! I invited you
to the party of the fucking
year.

08:24.167 --> 08:27.167
Guess I'll see you if I see you.
Bye.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.000
That boy doesn't come,
I'll lose my shit.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.133
That wasn't satisfying.

08:36.267 --> 08:40.832
That's brilliant, that is.
This looks fucking mint!

08:40.900 --> 08:44.633
The house is ready,
there's only one thing left to
do -

08:44.700 --> 08:47.867
get ourselves ready
before the family and friends
arrive

08:47.933 --> 08:50.400
and tonight, I'm going all-out.

08:57.367 --> 09:00.733
Which one's engagement?
I don't wanna be engaged.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.433
Left hand, one from your pinkie.
That one.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.233
You know Abbie's coming?
I know.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.533
How do you feel?

09:08.600 --> 09:12.267
Well, this is the problem,
right,
every time she's there,

09:12.333 --> 09:14.667
he seems to divert himself
over there.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.167
But why? (laughs)

09:16.233 --> 09:17.333
I...
Why?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.933
I am really nervous
about Abbie coming,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.533
in case she comes between
me and Beau.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.033
Can I give advice?

09:24.100 --> 09:26.700
You might see him in her
direction

09:26.767 --> 09:30.033
but unless he's actually doing
something wrong, don't boot off.

09:31.967 --> 09:32.967
Nat is right.

09:33.033 --> 09:37.733
Unless Beau does something
wrong, I
need to make sure I don't kick
off.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.867
I don't wanna scare him away.

09:41.100 --> 09:45.033
Tonight, it's gonna be a
massive,
massive, massive house party.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.033
I've invited Cameron...
Is he coming?

09:47.100 --> 09:49.433
...if he doesn't come,
he doesn't come.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.700
I'm looking forward to it.
Who have you got coming?

09:52.767 --> 09:55.933
Me brother, me sister as well,
which is fucking surprising,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.267
What?!
I know.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.933
Does Bethan know?
I haven't told her.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.233
She'll be happy for me.
What's gonna happen with Abbie?

10:04.300 --> 10:06.400
What do you mean?
Abbie's coming.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.133
She's still sour.

10:08.200 --> 10:13.033
My loyalties lie with Abbie
and I'm gonna have Abbie's back.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.667
I hope nothing ruins the night.

10:15.733 --> 10:19.900
If she does stick it on Beau,
girls would think it'd be muggy.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.933
What will happen,
it'll be me verse them.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.033
I love the parties
but it makes me miss the lads.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.567
It's making me think how far
away
I am from sunshine and my mates.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.800
You've got us!

10:38.633 --> 10:41.000
I need to know what he said.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.300
(all) Geordie Shore! Why aye!

10:47.000 --> 10:47.200
.

10:49.700 --> 10:49.900
.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.267
It looks fucking mint.
Done a good job.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.733
Can't believe
how good it turned out.

11:03.800 --> 11:07.033
House looks mint. We look mint.
It's gonna be sick.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.800
Hello, Nathan!

11:08.867 --> 11:13.367
(all chant) Nathan! Nathan!
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

11:13.433 --> 11:16.400
(all cheer)

11:16.467 --> 11:18.633
Take it all in, bitch.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.833
I'm not gonna lie.
I look fucking amazing.

11:21.900 --> 11:26.800
We should do a toast to the
family
inside and outside the house.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.467
My brother and sister
are coming too!

11:29.533 --> 11:31.133
Your sister?
Aye. My sister.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.033
What the fuck?
Beau's sister is coming.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.700
As if I didn't have enough
pressure
with Abbie here.

11:37.767 --> 11:40.733
Cheers, you lot!
(all cheer)

11:42.667 --> 11:45.167
Hi!
(all cheer)

11:45.233 --> 11:47.033
House parties are literally
amazing

11:47.100 --> 11:51.767
and I'm so happy to be welcomed
in with Sophie, Adam and Holly.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.667
Tonight is gonna be unreal.

11:58.667 --> 12:02.567
Everybody knows house parties
are the best fucking thing ever.

12:02.633 --> 12:05.167
Now I'm here,
it's gonna be even better.

12:09.867 --> 12:12.100
I'm so fucking fussin' for
tonight.

12:12.167 --> 12:15.567
Once you've had Persian,
there's no other version.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.600
Oh, my God!
This is the moment I was
dreading.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.133
This is so awkward.

12:31.033 --> 12:34.700
Looking forward to seeing
Tahlia.
Last time, had a cheeky neck-on.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.033
See what happens.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.300
Oi!

12:39.367 --> 12:42.867
Oh, my God. Harvey's here.
He's looking really fit.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.733
That's absolutely made my night.

12:47.833 --> 12:51.933
Oh, my God, Beau's sister
has just walked through the door

12:52.000 --> 12:54.033
and she is absolutely gorgeous.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.600
Seeing everyone's friends here
is
just making me miss my friends
more.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.733
I just a few drinks
and a good night.

13:21.733 --> 13:26.267
I'm having the best time tonight
and
I can't stop checking out
Harvey.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.867
I'm so excited
to see me girlfriend, Abbie.

13:43.933 --> 13:46.467
I'm glad she's come.
I've really missed her.

13:54.433 --> 13:58.333
There's only one guest that's
really
important that's missing

13:58.400 --> 13:59.600
and that's Cameron.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.267
Where the fuck is he?

14:06.033 --> 14:09.200
I haven't seen Nathan
this nervous in a long time

14:09.267 --> 14:13.067
and it's nice to see
he's excited to see another boy.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.233
Me and Adam had a cheeky
neck-on.
Something about that lad.

14:33.567 --> 14:38.733
Had a catch-up with Tahlia.
Hopefully, pick up where we left
off!

14:46.500 --> 14:49.400
I like Adam
but he more time I spend,

14:49.467 --> 14:54.267
the more two words come to mind
-
friend zone. (indistinct)

15:05.233 --> 15:07.600
Cameron looks really fit
tonight.

15:07.667 --> 15:11.267
He's dressed as a thief.
Might let him steal my heart.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.967
I am so happy for Nathan.
Cameron has made it.

15:19.033 --> 15:22.633
He's put a massive smile
on Nathan's face.

15:31.167 --> 15:35.000
I can see Beau, Harvey and
Phoebe
having a chat

15:35.067 --> 15:38.567
so I'm gonna pluck up Dutch
courage
and introduce meself.

15:54.167 --> 15:58.867
(laughs) Right. Oh, my God!

16:04.833 --> 16:06.367
So...
So...

16:16.633 --> 16:20.000
Me sister's opinion
is one of few I listen to.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.033
I'm glad she really likes
Bethan.

16:29.633 --> 16:32.400
Been trying to play it cool
with Harvey.

16:32.467 --> 16:35.767
It's time to bite the bullet
and make a move.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.867
Who's this big bastard
tugging at my Tahila?

16:43.933 --> 16:46.767
Gets any taller,
he'll be in the fucking clouds!

16:50.367 --> 16:53.133
Shite! What's this lad got I
didn't?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.733
To be fair,
he's built like a skyscraper.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.467
Should've worn my fucking heels.

17:07.467 --> 17:10.133
Chloe said there's something
between Bethan and Beau

17:10.200 --> 17:13.233
but me and Beau
are drawn to each other.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.633
I wanna know which one he
fancies.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.267
What are Beau and Abbie
talking about?

17:31.267 --> 17:34.867
Abbie's put me on the spot.
Don't wanna hurt feelings.

17:34.933 --> 17:39.700
Me and Bethan are in a good
place.
You gotta be cruel to be kind.

17:48.933 --> 17:53.667
I hope you do take that on board
cos that is sound fucking
advice.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.633
Oh!

18:04.700 --> 18:06.367
(laughs)

18:06.433 --> 18:09.000
Bethan is clearly not happy.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.733
She's me friend.
I'm gonna have her back.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.467
I could not believe
Abbie said she's got no
loyalties.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.800
That has annoyed us cos I do.

18:54.533 --> 18:58.733
Chloe keeps banging on about
loyalty
but I lived with the girl

18:58.800 --> 19:01.267
so where is her loyalty to me?

19:15.733 --> 19:19.800
Abbie has done nothing wrong
so Chloe's got no right kicking
off.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.300
I've been called many things
in my time but never a T-shirt.

19:59.633 --> 20:04.633
We all know this wouldn't
be a Geordie party without
drama.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.500
The last thing I wanted
was an argument

20:10.567 --> 20:13.067
and it's put a downer on the
night

20:13.133 --> 20:17.467
but I've got the perfect idea
to bring it back - a pillow
fight!

20:23.533 --> 20:27.733
One minute, I'm enjoying me
night
and the next, I've fallen.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.667
(moans)

20:29.733 --> 20:31.633
That's my night over.

20:31.700 --> 20:36.067
I'm off to bed but at least
Abbie's here to look after us.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.967
Right now, I am pissed off.

20:45.033 --> 20:48.200
There's one person that can
calm me down. That's Cameron.

20:53.467 --> 20:58.700
It's been a very, very, long
time
since I took someone to the shag
pad.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.800
And I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really nervous.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.033
The night's come to an end,
people starting to leave.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.467
I need to know
what he said to Abbie.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.200
Beau telling us this
has really made me night.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.900
I feel it's a big step forward.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.100
Chloe has made it very clear
she is not my biggest fan

21:44.167 --> 21:46.900
but Beau has finally
made his decision

21:46.967 --> 21:49.967
and I can walk away from
this shit-uation.

21:51.533 --> 21:55.033
I've lost the tripod tonight.
Nathan's got Cameron.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.933
Tahlia's got Harvey. Who have I
got?

21:59.067 --> 22:01.500
I'm still pissed off with Nathan

22:01.567 --> 22:04.600
and I've remembererd
I've gotta work with him
tomorrow.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.333
Sorry. Not in the mood.
No hanky-panky tonight.

22:10.133 --> 22:14.833
I've had a great time with
Harvey.
Few cheeky neck-ons is all I
wanted.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.567
I'm really enjoying
my time with Cameron

22:23.633 --> 22:25.867
and he is a good neck-on.

22:25.933 --> 22:29.100
I wanna get in the bed
and take it further.

22:32.033 --> 22:36.000
I've had some great house
parties
with the Geordie squads

22:36.067 --> 22:38.967
but tonight,
I really wasn't feeling myself.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.567
(laughter)

22:45.633 --> 22:47.833
Oh! Cameron!

22:47.900 --> 22:51.300
Can't believe he's going.
Is this a fucking joke?

22:51.367 --> 22:52.633
We can actually die.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.633
Ahh! I love you!

22:54.700 --> 22:56.667
(all) Geordie Shore! Why aye!

22:59.467 --> 22:59.667
.

23:02.200 --> 23:02.400
.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.400
I've woke up this morning
and my shoulder is still
pounding.

23:22.467 --> 23:25.333
Thank God I had Abbie
to look after us.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.400
I hate to say goodbye.
Kills us every time.

23:35.133 --> 23:38.067
Get up.
No. Hello, Wonder Woman.

23:38.133 --> 23:40.433
I woke up pissed off at Nathan.

23:41.700 --> 23:46.500
Are you taking the piss? I gotta
work with him today. Fucking
hell.

23:46.567 --> 23:51.767
You know, thinking about Nathan,
for him to say, "Bethan's fine."

23:51.833 --> 23:56.133
How the fuck does he know?
He doesn't ask if I'm all right.

23:56.200 --> 24:00.533
Nathan is the person
I'm least close to in the house.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.633
Wish we had a closer bond.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.267
Who did you get with last night?
Harvey.

24:05.333 --> 24:09.967
Me and Harvey had a good time
and I'd like to see him again.

24:10.033 --> 24:13.233
What I'm gonna say is...
(gasps)

24:13.300 --> 24:16.367
Oh, my God! You slept in his
piss.

24:16.433 --> 24:20.033
I am fucking livid!
Why are you weeing the bed, man?

24:20.100 --> 24:21.867
Is he joking me?

24:21.933 --> 24:26.133
I've been marinating in his piss
all night? That is disgusting.

24:29.167 --> 24:33.000
Don't know why I was nervous
getting Cameron in the shag pad.

24:33.067 --> 24:37.967
Had fun necking but that's
as far as I wanted to go...for
now.

24:42.300 --> 24:46.000
Hi.
Hello, Angel. Good night?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.700
It felt weird. I had a good
time.

24:48.767 --> 24:53.200
There's a boy in the shag pad.
Long time since that's happened.

24:53.267 --> 24:55.833
You gonna see him again?
Yes.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.167
So proud of how far Nathan's
come.

24:58.233 --> 25:02.167
I can't believe he had somebody
in the shag pad last night.

25:02.233 --> 25:07.633
The way I seen it,
Bethan was sat laughing and
dancing.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.233
Right.
Chloe's kicking off.

25:09.300 --> 25:13.033
A difference of opinions.
People getting involved.

25:13.100 --> 25:17.267
I've gotta work with her.
I'm not gonna talk to her.

25:24.267 --> 25:26.900
Why are you putting milk?
I like milk.

25:26.967 --> 25:29.233
House is a mess.
How are you?

25:29.300 --> 25:31.833
I'm tip-top, mate.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.567
Where's Alex?

25:36.167 --> 25:39.900
Last night, I didn't have
the best time at the party.

25:39.967 --> 25:43.033
I think I need to
speak to the family.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.633
I'm not gonna step on this.
Oh, my God.

25:46.700 --> 25:49.833
Well, things went well, didn't
they?
(laughs)

25:49.900 --> 25:53.500
I wanted to say one thing.
It's been on my mind.

25:53.567 --> 25:57.100
I've had fun but I'm heading
home.
What?!

25:57.167 --> 25:58.700
Are you going?
Yeah.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.833
I'm absolutely gutted Alex is
going.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.833
I've had so much fun with him.
Genuinely am gonna miss him.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.300
Bye-bye, princess.

26:06.367 --> 26:09.500
I knew there was
something up with Alex.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.500
If this is right for him, so be
it.

26:12.567 --> 26:14.033
But I'm gutted.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.733
Bye, my friend.

26:15.800 --> 26:20.600
I love Alex but he was just
visiting
and he was always gonna go.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.933
Bye, Alex.
I'll see youse later on.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.167
I cannot believe Alex wants to
go.
Actually, I can.

26:26.233 --> 26:29.200
Weather's shit
and it's so awkward in this
house.

26:29.267 --> 26:31.700
I'm gonna get ready.
Let's get ready.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.767
It's time.
The time has come.

26:38.833 --> 26:44.367
It has. Put it this way, I
genuinely
feel like I've got new family
now.

26:44.433 --> 26:49.233
I want Nathan to sort the drama
out
with Chloe. I don't want bad
blood.

26:49.300 --> 26:52.800
Nathan, I know you are
a strong friend. Love you all.

26:52.867 --> 26:55.400
G'day, mate! (laughs)

26:55.467 --> 26:57.133
Bye!
Bye-bye!

26:57.200 --> 27:01.267
Alex might run his mouth
but he's got a heart of gold

27:01.333 --> 27:05.067
and that's why he'll always
have a place in this family.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.900
Whoo!

27:06.967 --> 27:10.433
I can't believe he's gone.
I feel a bit sad.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.367
Ah! How you going, mate?

27:12.433 --> 27:16.933
Gonna miss my Geordie family.
It's
not the last they're gonna see
of me.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.233
I'm like a boomerang.
I always come back!

27:20.300 --> 27:23.167
On that note, we better go to
work.

27:23.233 --> 27:25.033
Please make friends.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.200
See youse.
Awkward.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.600
Chloe done really wrong.
(burps)

27:31.667 --> 27:35.033
Keep our fingers crossed
they sort shit out today.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.133
Alex's speech this morning
did hit home.

27:42.200 --> 27:47.400
Me and Chloe need to make up but
I don't know how to make the
move.

27:50.733 --> 27:54.433
We've arrived at a hotel.
I hope we're not cleaning rooms.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.433
Hello, hello.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.800
No!
No!

27:59.867 --> 28:03.167
What are them ropes for?
I'm feeling a bit ropey.

28:03.233 --> 28:06.067
Anna wants me to check out
this bonding exercise.

28:06.133 --> 28:09.700
Chloe and Nathan have
had more ups and downs than
anyone

28:09.767 --> 28:12.400
so choosing them
was a fucking no-brainer.

28:12.467 --> 28:15.400
As you know, it's not
your average Geordie choice.

28:15.467 --> 28:19.233
You'll be abseiling off
the edge of this wonderful
hotel.

28:19.300 --> 28:22.733
Is this a fucking joke?
We could actually die.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.033
I'll be at waiting with open
arms
for a cuddle.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.900
See you later.
All right.

28:29.633 --> 28:31.133
(laughs)
You fucking idiot.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.800
Today,
I was not gonnagoons speak to
Nathan

28:33.867 --> 28:38.067
but need to sort things when
we're about to jump off a
building.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.300
Of all the things we could've
done,
this? Really?

28:43.367 --> 28:44.400
Oh, God!

28:44.467 --> 28:47.867
I did think you went to argue
for no reason.

28:47.933 --> 28:52.233
You don't know how Bethan's
feeling
cos you never really ask her.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.433
I don't know her that well.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.667
But she is living in the house.
I should've.

28:57.733 --> 29:00.233
Bethan and Chloe
are joined at the hip.

29:00.300 --> 29:03.167
I haven't had time
to get to know her.

29:03.233 --> 29:05.767
I'm not as close
as to other newbies.

29:05.833 --> 29:09.733
Listen, we've made up now.
Yeah. Shall we have a hug?

29:13.233 --> 29:15.767
I forgive you.
I've got makeup on youse.

29:15.833 --> 29:19.000
That's the least of my problems.
I feel fucking ill.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.567
Oh, look how high!

29:23.700 --> 29:28.767
(gasps) You can see the whole of
Newcastle. Don't think I can do
this.

29:28.833 --> 29:31.333
If I do it, you've gotta.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.733
We are that high in the sky,
I've got altitude.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.933
Me brain is about to explode.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.867
Been nice knowing you, kids.

29:38.933 --> 29:43.400
I don't wanna but we're at work
and one of us needs to.

29:43.467 --> 29:46.700
Is this a normal thing?
It's silly thing to do.

29:46.767 --> 29:50.267
Put your legs over there first.
Oh!

29:50.333 --> 29:54.067
Watching Nathan go off the
building,
I feel I could faint.

29:54.133 --> 29:57.533
I'm sorry, Chloe, for everything
I've done! I love you!

29:57.600 --> 29:59.533
I'm having a moment of clarity.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.100
Oh, my God! Why?!

30:01.167 --> 30:04.600
I've regretted everything
I've ever said or done to Chloe.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.167
(shrieks)
OK.

30:08.233 --> 30:10.200
Oh, my God. Where you going?

30:10.267 --> 30:13.133
Dunno. Might go for a beer.
Don't do that!

30:13.200 --> 30:17.200
Put both hands on that white
rope
and you're in control now.

30:17.267 --> 30:23.200
Ah! Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my
fucking
days! I wanna get off now!

30:23.267 --> 30:25.100
(retches)

30:25.167 --> 30:27.867
Shit! Shit! Shit!

30:27.933 --> 30:31.900
This is where no man should be
teetering along. It's dangerous.

30:31.967 --> 30:34.833
It's stupid. And this isn't fun.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.933
Ahh! Oh, my God! I'm miles away!

30:38.000 --> 30:39.333
Come here, then!

30:39.400 --> 30:42.433
Will you and your big bot
fucking nash on?

30:42.500 --> 30:47.467
I've got a date with some bird
later
and Scotty T is never late.

30:47.533 --> 30:50.067
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nathan?

30:50.133 --> 30:51.867
I think I'm gonna faint.

30:51.933 --> 30:57.300
I'm not doing this. I'm not. I
feel
ill. Oh, my God. I'm gonna
faint. Oh!

30:57.367 --> 31:00.467
Not that fucking bad, man!

31:00.533 --> 31:04.233
You don't shut up,
I'll jump and land on your head!

31:04.300 --> 31:06.667
That'll be two of us squashed!
Oh!

31:06.733 --> 31:09.767
Hiya, mate! Wasn't that nice?

31:09.833 --> 31:13.833
Right now, although it was
scary,
I do feel good for myself.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.600
How are you, Chloe?
How are you, man?

31:19.133 --> 31:20.567
Ow.

31:20.633 --> 31:26.233
Why the fuck hang off a building
when I've got me man, me dog and
Sam?

31:27.633 --> 31:30.200
Honestly, trust me. Trust me.

31:30.267 --> 31:34.800
That was one of the best things.
I can't do it. So sorry.

31:34.867 --> 31:36.067
Group hug?
Yeah.

31:36.133 --> 31:37.433
Come on.
Group hug.

31:37.500 --> 31:42.400
I've gotta bounce cos I've got
some
bird waiting to abseil down me
pipe

31:42.467 --> 31:43.533
with knee harness.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.233
Oh!
Let's get drunk tonight.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.300
Yeah.

31:50.567 --> 31:54.933
How's the shoulder?
A bit sore. Not gonna lie.

31:56.733 --> 31:59.800
I wonder how it's going
between Chloe and Nathan.

31:59.867 --> 32:02.133
I hope to God
they've resolved things.

32:04.133 --> 32:06.833
Hi! Hello!

32:06.900 --> 32:10.467
We're friends again.
Thank fuck these two have made
up.

32:10.533 --> 32:14.033
I would've hated it
if it was my fault.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.467
Kind of had to
because we almost died.

32:18.533 --> 32:20.500
We were literally on...
Elaborate.

32:20.567 --> 32:22.967
Abseiling down.
Shut up!

32:23.033 --> 32:25.733
You are lying!
That is amazing!

32:25.800 --> 32:29.667
Not gonna lie. I didn't do it.
How did she get down?

32:29.733 --> 32:32.800
I went, "Oh, my God."
Nearly fainted. Had concussion.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.100
(laughs)

32:35.167 --> 32:38.700
Shall we get ready, then?
Yeah! That's a good one.

32:44.133 --> 32:46.467
For you.
What? But I love it!

32:46.533 --> 32:48.167
I'm pissing in a plant.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.267
(all) Geordie Shore! Why aye!

32:53.967 --> 32:54.167
.

32:56.667 --> 32:56.867
.

33:11.300 --> 33:15.700
How weird is it, getting ready
now,
and Alex isn't here?

33:15.767 --> 33:17.833
I miss him. Not gonna lie.

33:17.900 --> 33:21.100
I class him as a mate.
I did like him.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.133
Alex's presence is definitely
missed.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.600
After today, abseiling
down that fucking building,

33:26.667 --> 33:29.000
I feel powerful.

33:29.067 --> 33:32.033
I've had Cameron stay over
and we made up.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.467
I'm over the moon
that Chloe and Nathan made up.

33:35.533 --> 33:39.667
We don't have long left.
We need to make the most of it.

33:41.533 --> 33:44.600
Tonight's gonna be a good night.
Really good night.

33:44.667 --> 33:47.533
I'm very excited.
Don't want any arguments.

33:47.600 --> 33:52.300
Are you glad you spoke to
Nathan?
I'm glad that's over and done
with.

33:52.367 --> 33:55.733
Yeah. 100%.
Know what? Sam's trying really
hard.

33:55.800 --> 34:00.033
The affection is there
but the passion has fucking
gone.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.200
How do I get it back?

34:02.267 --> 34:07.767
It's the best that it's ever
been
but the bedroom, it's not very
spicy.

34:07.833 --> 34:11.933
Cos you've had my back so much,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.300
I'm gonna speak to Sam for you

34:14.367 --> 34:17.300
and I'm gonna try to set the
mood.

34:17.367 --> 34:21.199
Well, youse,
we better crack on and get
ready.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.900
Lasses, get up out of bed!

34:30.400 --> 34:34.600
We're going on a night out,
bitches!
Chloe, come on.

34:34.667 --> 34:36.500
You look unreal!

34:36.567 --> 34:38.199
Everyone's in a good mood,

34:38.266 --> 34:41.967
we look fit as fuck
so we'll have a great time.

34:42.033 --> 34:44.167
Shall we cheers to Alex?
Yes.

34:44.233 --> 34:46.300
Our long-distance Australian
friend.

34:46.367 --> 34:50.100
To Alex!
To Alex! G'day, mate!

34:50.167 --> 34:54.667
This is in memory of Alex. He's
not
dead. He's gone to Australia.

34:54.733 --> 34:58.000
Let's go! Yay!

35:04.000 --> 35:07.900
Tonight, we're in
one of our favourite clubs, Tup
Tup.

35:07.967 --> 35:11.267
Every time we're here,
we always have a good night.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.800
I'm so proud how far
me and Nathan have come
together.

36:03.867 --> 36:07.767
We finally got over our exes
and are enjoying the single
life.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.067
Tahlia's got Harvey
and I've got Cameron

36:20.133 --> 36:25.833
and Alex, well, he's got
Australia
so this is the end of the
tripod.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.533
Trying to come up with
a name for the new duo

36:42.600 --> 36:46.300
so I suggest the first two
things
always on my mind.

37:01.967 --> 37:05.300
Before Sam gets pissed,
I need to speak with him.

37:05.367 --> 37:10.267
I've got an idea that'll put a
huge
smile on his and Chloe's face.

37:20.567 --> 37:23.533
Not sure how I feel
about Bethan giving tips

37:23.600 --> 37:26.400
but she knows Chloe well
so I'm listening.

37:37.467 --> 37:40.033
I've given Sam
all the advice he needs.

37:40.100 --> 37:43.433
He needs to
fill the shag pad with plants

37:43.500 --> 37:46.167
and Chloe will plant herself
on his penis.

37:57.433 --> 38:01.200
The family are all getting along
and having a wicked night.

38:01.267 --> 38:05.233
There's an elephant in the room.
I need to talk to Bethan.

38:20.633 --> 38:24.933
It's nice Nathan does wanna make
an effort and have a friendship.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.800
It's just a shame it's took this
long
to understand each other.

38:40.433 --> 38:45.233
I can't believe how quickly me
and
Bethan have gone from not
talking

38:45.300 --> 38:47.533
to me admitting everything I
feel.

39:18.667 --> 39:21.300
Tonight, has been amazing.

39:21.367 --> 39:24.133
We've danced like twats,
we've drank like fishes.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.200
Now, we need to go get Sam
shagged.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.467
(laughs)

39:36.000 --> 39:39.200
Oh! Oh!

39:41.333 --> 39:43.400
Waste not, want not.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.500
I'm gonna go straight to bed.

39:48.667 --> 39:52.100
Remember...
Me need to make Chloe
distracted.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.033
You get the plants in.
You distract her.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.900
I'll distract her.
Let me get kebab first.

39:58.967 --> 40:02.233
Bethan and Sam have been
suspicious.
What they up to?

40:02.300 --> 40:06.367
Follow me. Follow me now. Need
to
show you something quickly. Now.

40:06.433 --> 40:09.933
So far, so good.
This is gonna go just fine.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.600
Listen,
you need to get inside of that.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.033
What's going on?

40:14.100 --> 40:18.033
Bethan took me upstairs and
she's trying to get me in
lingerie.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.033
I'm a catch
but I'm not a lesbian anymore!

40:22.067 --> 40:27.000
Listen, we're gonna get as many
plants as we can into the shag
pad.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.400
Chloe's going to
the Amazon rainforest!

40:34.933 --> 40:37.533
Come on! Ow. Ow.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.767
All the way around.
Around the bed?

40:42.833 --> 40:46.067
I never thought moving plant
pots
would be so stressful.

40:46.133 --> 40:48.833
Need to get 'em in
before Chloe realises.

40:54.133 --> 40:57.167
Go on. Get inside.
Get on the chaise lounge.

40:57.233 --> 41:00.500
In the bed! Sam, get in the bed!

41:00.567 --> 41:02.267
My work here is done.

41:02.333 --> 41:06.733
But Sam and Chloe are absolutely
mortal so I'm not holding me
breath.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.767
Get inside! Oh!

41:08.833 --> 41:11.367
Listen... (chuckles)

41:11.433 --> 41:13.833
Am I in a florist?
No.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.500
You're the plant, woman.
This is for you.

41:16.567 --> 41:21.000
It's like Dobbies Garden Centre.
What the hell? But I love it!

41:28.100 --> 41:32.333
I can't believe it! The
rainforest
has worked! She fucking loves
it!

41:33.533 --> 41:35.300
It's hot!
(shrieks)

41:35.367 --> 41:36.433
Oh!

41:36.500 --> 41:41.067
It's that time when me and
Nathan
do what we do - own that
hot-tub.

41:41.133 --> 41:44.800
(shrieks) Oh, my God! Oh, my
God!

41:44.867 --> 41:48.200
I'm pissing in a plant.
I'll wait.

41:55.033 --> 41:59.733
I can't kiss Beau so I do
the next best thing - kiss his
lass.

42:03.033 --> 42:05.233
Fucking hell.
You're taking this seriously!

42:07.733 --> 42:12.933
Well, I think it's fair to say
me and Nathan have bonded
tonight.

42:21.033 --> 42:24.967
I did not wanna see
Beau's back, sac and crack.

42:25.033 --> 42:27.667
Don't care he's all right.
My eyes aren't!

42:30.700 --> 42:34.933
Can't sit in this broth of
bodies
any longer. I'm going to bed.

42:36.233 --> 42:37.433
Leave me alone!

42:46.200 --> 42:49.700
Tonight, has literally been
jokes from start to finish.

42:49.767 --> 42:55.100
Everyone's got on so well but
now
it's time to end it with a
cuddle.

43:00.833 --> 43:02.533
Damn!
What?

43:02.600 --> 43:04.933
There's so many plants!

43:06.300 --> 43:08.867
That's a lot, that is. Not good.

43:12.233 --> 43:16.100
That has really thrown us.
Tonight is gonna be dick-tastic!

43:16.167 --> 43:18.267
He is a fucking idiot!

43:18.333 --> 43:20.633
It's our last day.
Doh, doh, doh!

43:20.700 --> 43:22.767
Youse, it's Aaron!
Oh, my God!

43:22.833 --> 43:24.567
All the oldies have arrived.

43:24.633 --> 43:26.433
(cheering)
Go get him!

43:26.500 --> 43:28.200
(cheering)
I think he's won!

43:30.267 --> 43:32.000
Oh, my God!

43:35.100 --> 43:38.433
This is quite sad.
About to take a new chapter.

44:05.433 --> 44:05.633
.
