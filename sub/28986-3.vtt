00:48.080 --> 00:50.595
- Why do you smile?
- Why do you?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.832
Recalling a certain night.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.713
When you asked me if I liked you.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.634
And do you...

01:01.680 --> 01:03.797
- ...like me still?
- Mm, for some strange reason.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.633
As I, perversely, still like you.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.234
Well, that's only fitty.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.749
Everything's fitty, now we're home.

01:18.760 --> 01:23.471
And London and its strange ways
are far, far away.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.312
<i>Captain Poldark...</i>

01:52.240 --> 01:55.119
<i>...if you are reading this letter,
then I am dead.</i>

01:57.080 --> 02:01.472
<i>With my demise, you must be made aware
of the forces with which you are dealing.</i>

02:01.560 --> 02:03.995
<i>They are without remorse.</i>

02:04.080 --> 02:06.549
If you would preserve yourself
and your family,

02:06.640 --> 02:08.757
distance yourself from Ned Despard,

02:08.840 --> 02:12.914
<i>lest the association be fatal to you,
as it has been so to me.</i>

02:18.800 --> 02:20.632
Bannantine's dead.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.040
What?

02:23.200 --> 02:25.032
- How?
- Drowned.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.635
- His landlady says.
- An accident?

02:28.680 --> 02:30.080
Do you think it likely?

02:32.480 --> 02:34.119
Hanson's in Truro.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.760
I can't know if he had a hand
in Bannantine's death,

02:36.840 --> 02:38.718
but I do know his presence here...

02:38.800 --> 02:40.757
Is unlikely to be for
the good of his health.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.872
He'd be well advised to avoid me.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.997
And you him.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.959
In fact, you'd be well advised
to avoid confrontation of any kind.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.714
- So I should go to ground?
- Literally, below grass.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.793
Have we broken through yet?

02:55.880 --> 02:58.440
I told them they should've used more powder.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.797
The Colonel must bear with us.
We're a cautious lot here.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.349
So the job takes twice as long.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.716
Come, man, where's our derring-do?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.116
Oh...!

03:18.200 --> 03:20.078
Ned and his fireworks.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.119
Seems to have whetted Master Ross' appetite
for them.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.954
Ned learnt his trade
building fortifications in America.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.952
He knows what he's doing.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.200
Hm!

03:33.760 --> 03:35.558
Rosina!

03:35.640 --> 03:38.599
Oh, dear, poor Tommy.
Have you been fighting?

03:38.680 --> 03:41.639
No, mistress,
I'm afeared it's scurvy.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.598
Dr Enys warned me it might return.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.593
Well, that won't do, will it?

03:46.680 --> 03:47.750
Hm?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.754
Thank you, ma'am.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.479
See 'ee, Captain,
my lad Arthur be 12 now

04:05.560 --> 04:07.631
and more than fitty for work below grass.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.992
- And when he's 14, he shall have it.
- Aye, but that's two year away.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.959
How do you expect him to survive
on chillun's wage till then?

04:15.040 --> 04:18.192
You know very well why I keep children
above grass until they're 14.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.913
They earn less in the short term.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.753
But in the long run, more.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.160
Cos they live longer.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.960
Now's when the living's needed.
My lad's weak with hunger.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.556
And Demelza, at this very moment,
is in Sawle handing out supplies.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.597
He don't want charity.
He wants men's work.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.911
And if 'ee will not offer it,
I know who will.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.434
Come on, lad,
we'll ask Warleggan for work.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.871
Your mother would be most aggrieved
to think of you neglecting your studies.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.314
But I haven't.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.754
Am I not correct, dear?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.275
<i>We certainly want no dunces here.</i>

05:01.360 --> 05:02.840
Hm.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.752
Sir...

05:04.840 --> 05:07.196
My dear, would you care to accompany me
to Truro?

05:07.280 --> 05:10.273
- I have matters to attend to at the bank.
- Ah, I think not.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.558
Cardy, assist Sir George to his room.
He's unwell.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.279
He is no such thing.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.477
My dear, you tell them I'm perfectly fine.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.677
- Cardy, take his arm.
- Here, this is...

05:19.760 --> 05:21.080
This is outrageous!

05:21.160 --> 05:23.550
Unhand me!
Elizabeth, tell them to unhand me!

05:30.000 --> 05:33.311
See it done by tomorrow.
Orders from Mistress Poldark.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.077
It is lucky my sister have
such a generous heart, after what 'ee did.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.596
Not many'd give 'ee a second chance.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.072
Maybe I give her a second chance.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.199
How so?

05:49.280 --> 05:54.355
How long do 'ee think I be content
to skivvy and scrape and take orders?

05:55.600 --> 05:58.399
It is only biding time
till better comes along.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.676
- Better what?
- Better work.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.558
Better wage.
Better mistress.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.360
Better mate.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.796
Don't trouble 'eeself to fetch this.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.156
I'll have brother Sam send it.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.038
Brother Sam it be, then.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.431
Head of the Royal Cornwall Infirmary?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.235
Well, Dr Enys,
it's no more than you deserve.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.198
But more than I desire.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.637
Note the timing.
Hard on the heels of the Hadfield trial.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.077
Yes, my love, but whether you like it
or not, you are now a celebrity.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.960
- So you think I should accept?
- Do you not?

07:13.040 --> 07:15.191
And abandon my patients here?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.634
Well...

07:16.720 --> 07:20.031
...Horace believes your patients here
take you very much for granted.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.238
Horace knows that one of the few advantages
of being a wealthy squire

07:23.320 --> 07:26.597
is my ability to treat patients
without the need to charge excessively.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.592
At least consider it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.514
I will consider it.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.800
Sit down. Leave it.
Take a seat.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.832
Mr Hanson...

07:57.760 --> 07:59.513
Are you enjoying Cornwall?

08:01.200 --> 08:03.954
I'm here on business,
so have little time for pleasure.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.396
Surely the two are not incompatible?

08:06.480 --> 08:09.552
Depending on how one conducts
one's business and what its aims might be.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.474
Well, surely the aim of any business
is to make a profit?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.429
Sit down.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.914
Did you enjoy the pamphlet?

08:27.640 --> 08:28.915
I found it a little one-sided.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.720
Like the reports which accused its subject
of treason.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.030
Would you happen to know
who's responsible?

08:35.120 --> 08:38.796
I don't concern myself
with other people's affairs.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.996
Are you quite sure of that?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.554
Ned...

08:43.640 --> 08:45.597
I think we're wanted elsewhere.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.514
What portion of "avoid confrontation"
was unclear to you?

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
Apologies.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.319
I could not resist.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.996
Besides, ask yourself,
what really brings that man to Cornwall?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.474
Who's this?

09:05.560 --> 09:08.519
Charlie and Jacob.
My apprentices.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.592
Good day to you, sirs.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.993
Can we afford them?

09:15.080 --> 09:16.355
No.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.352
But they come every day, begging to learn

09:18.440 --> 09:20.477
and I can't ask them to work for naught.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.951
- And better here than down the mine.
- Don't I know it.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.556
I went below at nine and I'd never wish
such a fate on any son of mine.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.955
Wedded bliss!

09:33.040 --> 09:35.396
Are they not enough
to recommend the state?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.119
Not to me!

09:37.200 --> 09:39.760
No disrespect, ma'am,
but I value my freedom.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.194
Little as it is.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.557
Well, perhaps one day you'll meet a man
who'll change your mind.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.710
Urgh!

09:45.800 --> 09:47.837
The man does not exist.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.150
Have you been showing Miss Hanson
the sights hereabouts?

09:51.240 --> 09:54.119
- We've visited Hendrawna.
- And the holy well?

09:54.200 --> 09:55.759
Now, that we cannot miss.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.277
- You know I don't hold with religion.
- This is not religion. This is faith.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.714
And magic.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.039
I must go.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.271
My father will be sending out
a search for me.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.153
Cecily...
Perhaps one more sight?

10:14.640 --> 10:16.597
<i>Is Sir George still resting?</i>

10:16.680 --> 10:19.275
<i>We left him undisturbed, sir,
as you instructed.</i>

10:26.400 --> 10:27.800
Nephew...

10:33.560 --> 10:34.789
Where did you get that?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.076
<i>Oh, George, what are you doing?</i>

10:37.160 --> 10:39.231
<i>How will that serve any of us?</i>

10:39.320 --> 10:43.109
- It will serve me to be rid of that thief.
- Put the pistol down, George.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.998
<i>Compose yourself, George.</i>

10:46.000 --> 10:47.832
<i>- What have I stolen?</i>
- George...

10:47.920 --> 10:49.877
<i>- She was never yours to begin with.
- Never.</i>

10:49.960 --> 10:51.952
- George, it is me.
<i>- I pity you.</i>

10:52.040 --> 10:54.111
- Nephew, it's your uncle.
<i>- But there it is.</i>

10:54.200 --> 10:55.634
- I don't want your pity
- Nephew...

10:55.720 --> 10:57.616
- I want you in hell.
<i>- That'll be the day.</i>

10:57.640 --> 11:00.758
- Just put the pistol down.
<i>- You were always an atrocious shot.</i>

11:00.840 --> 11:02.513
Urgh!

11:21.200 --> 11:23.669
Mr Ralph Hanson to see you, sir.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.274
Uncle...

11:27.360 --> 11:29.352
Sir George is not to leave this room.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.920
- Yes, sir.
- Uncle...

11:43.640 --> 11:45.632
- Did I hear a gunshot?
- What?

11:45.720 --> 11:48.394
Ah, yes, our gamekeeper.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.197
You'll forgive me calling unannounced.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.680
I'm in the district on business

11:59.760 --> 12:02.992
and wondered if we might resume
our negotiations

12:03.080 --> 12:06.391
concerning our mutual interests
in Honduras.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.598
Oh, well, that might prove somewhat tricky.

12:10.600 --> 12:15.629
Sir George has been called away
to the North of England.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.475
- When does he return?
- Ah, well, there's no definite day.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.076
These things take time,
as you well know.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.073
Well, time is of the essence
if we are to purchase more slaves

12:26.160 --> 12:27.913
and harvest our new territories.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.399
Young Valentine.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.709
Clumsy child.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.318
The boy's getting out of hand.
I must go and reprimand him.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.278
Allow me to show you out.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.479
It was a right of way,
till Sir Warleggan fenced it off.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.711
Could we not explore?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.757
It was, after all, a Poldark house.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.752
And may be again.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.240
But for now...

13:08.240 --> 13:10.038
...no Poldark must set foot in it.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.515
Come on.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.440
Clowance!

13:33.960 --> 13:37.840
Folk ask, how can God love us
when he let the harvest fail?

13:37.920 --> 13:41.630
When mines close?
When children starve?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.554
What more do the Lord require of us?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.639
Patience.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.040
Forbearance.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.520
Fortitude.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.319
Rum and gaff!

13:57.000 --> 13:59.674
Jesus tells us,
as the Father loved me...

13:59.760 --> 14:01.558
He have no gratitude.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.109
Everyone do know Captain Poldark
employs more than he needs,

14:04.200 --> 14:05.634
and pays more than he can afford.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.115
Yes.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.270
But is it enough?

14:12.320 --> 14:14.073
Perhaps once, but now?

14:14.160 --> 14:16.231
There have never been such scarcity.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.073
Could more be done?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.514
I'd say so, mistress.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.478
Unless rich folk be happy to see girls
go sell themselves down Truro Quay.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.995
- Is that their only choice?
- Reckon so, ma'am.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.158
We ain't all lucky enough
to sell our body to our master

14:32.240 --> 14:35.278
for the price of a wedding ring, mistress.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.959
She had no business to say that.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.194
She's right.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.792
I knew what I was doing
when I went to Ross' room that night.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.156
He was an honourable man...

14:55.240 --> 14:58.438
...and I took advantage,
in his time of weakness.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.477
I too.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.829
14 nights I...

15:04.120 --> 15:06.510
...nursed my master through
the fever.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.516
On the 15th night, he asked me to his bed
and I went willingly.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.592
Before you were his wife?

15:16.160 --> 15:17.310
Mama, can I read to you?

15:18.280 --> 15:21.114
- Yes, if you like.
- And me, Mama. Can I?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.396
I'm the best.
I'm better than Tommy.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.676
He can't read a single word.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.956
Why can't he, Mama?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.509
- I expect no-one's taught him.
- Why not?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.231
Because they didn't think it mattered.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.514
Where have you been?

15:50.600 --> 15:51.716
Exploring.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.996
I dislike the thought of you
roaming the countryside.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.276
- I meant the shops, Papa.
- Ah.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.079
Truro is so quaint.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.197
Well, make the most of it.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.078
As soon has my business here
is concluded,

16:02.160 --> 16:03.833
we shall be returning to civilisation.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.639
What is that business, Papa?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.994
When I deem it needful for you to know,
you will be informed.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.192
I admire your patience.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.834
- To who?
- Your rebellious housemaid.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.992
Not only does she try
to burn the house down...

16:31.080 --> 16:32.434
Well, she swears she did not.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.796
But she resolutely declines
to know her place.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.839
And did I know my place
when first I came?

16:40.320 --> 16:42.676
She's as unlike you as it's possible to be.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.319
And, yes, you did.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.039
Except for that night...

16:48.080 --> 16:49.514
...when I came to your room.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.876
I think, if you had not,
I'd have come out and fetched you.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.432
- Lord, Ross, what an urchin I was.
- Mm.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.477
I was fond of that urchin.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.959
Imagine if she'd remained
as she was, though.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.714
Never learnt manners...

17:09.040 --> 17:10.759
...to read or write.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.152
You could never have married her.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.550
Because I cared
if you could scrawl your own name?

17:17.640 --> 17:18.835
But I cared.

17:19.839 --> 17:25.074
And now it seems to me that the true
difference betwixt commons and gentry

17:25.160 --> 17:27.435
is simply that - learning.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.672
Because, without it,
no-one can rise above their station.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.560
I have an idea...

17:37.400 --> 17:40.916
We have nigh on 50 children
working above grass at Wheal Grace.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.000
But Captain Poldark has agreed
to give them Saturday afternoon off,

17:46.080 --> 17:49.471
with pay,
so they can learn reading and writing.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.634
Children don't need schooling,
they need feeding.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.560
The Lord say,
"Man do not live by bread alone."

17:55.600 --> 17:57.717
- Will learning house or clothe a body?
- Not yet.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.236
- But in the long run...
- Now! Now is when we need it.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.993
Not sometime next century!

18:07.280 --> 18:08.396
Daughter!

18:13.720 --> 18:15.473
How do you like our Cornish climate?

18:15.560 --> 18:18.075
Better than London's, I can assure you.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.079
Let him be.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.958
He's not worth your attention.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.710
- I applaud your forbearance.
- Well, I do not.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.678
Such affronts should not be tolerated.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.593
Do you think to challenge him to a duel?

18:46.680 --> 18:48.637
I think I might challenge the entire county.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.910
A gather, to which the great and the good
of the county will be summoned.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.232
- For the purpose?
- Of broadening their narrow little minds.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.916
I told 'ee it would fall on deaf ears.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.316
And yet, forgive me...

19:05.400 --> 19:07.357
...how can they appreciate
what they're missing

19:07.440 --> 19:09.352
if they don't understand the benefits?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.909
Why did you all learn to read?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.952
So I could preach the gospel of Our Lord.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.077
So I'd not disgrace myself in company.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.716
So I wouldn't be sent away to school.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.033
So I could write letters
to Miss Morwenna Chynoweth.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.674
You see?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.513
You all had cause to learn.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.273
These people have none.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.238
Well, none that they can see.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.912
My brother Tommy's thirsty.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.798
Can he beg a cup of milk?

19:47.880 --> 19:48.996
Of course.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.309
Come in.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.075
Come in.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.716
Please, take a piece of cake.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.594
Thank you.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.473
Would you like to look at this picture book
while you eat your cake?

20:33.480 --> 20:35.199
The evidence is there.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.069
Not prejudice or supposition,
but scientifically ratified by men

20:39.160 --> 20:41.231
who are experts in the field.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.438
The eminent Carl Linnaeus.
Do you know him?

20:45.520 --> 20:47.318
Lady Whitworth brought him.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.438
Apparently they share
some business interests.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.957
Divides the human species
into four distinct varieties.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.478
At the top, naturally,
is the Europaeus Albus.

20:58.560 --> 21:04.192
Fair, white, blue-eyed,
strong-minded, rational, discerning.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.397
Genteel, inventive, noble, pure...

21:06.480 --> 21:08.199
And at the bottom?

21:08.280 --> 21:10.636
Oh, your Africanus Niger.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.473
Small of brain, broad of skull...

21:14.560 --> 21:16.074
My dears, how delightful to see you.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.197
Crafty, cunning.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.476
Come and meet some of our guests.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.155
And incapable of understanding
anything other than brute force

21:23.240 --> 21:24.879
and simple instruction.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.590
May I present our friends
Colonel and Mrs Despard?

21:29.600 --> 21:30.829
Lady Whitworth.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.878
Dr Penrose.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.758
Did I hear you correctly, sir?

21:35.840 --> 21:38.196
I am cunning, witless
and in need of a beating?

21:41.920 --> 21:45.311
Of course, he speaks purely
from a scientific perspective.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.833
My dear Lady Whitworth, it's so comforting
to feel superior, is it not?

21:54.040 --> 21:56.919
Especially when we have <i>science</i>
to back us up.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.758
I can only apologise. Caroline thought
to invite all the local worthies.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.957
But, forgive me, I should have checked.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.360
Please...

22:08.440 --> 22:10.432
...don't distress yourself.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.557
Our paths need not cross.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.791
I'm sure she'll be eager to avoid me.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.513
Oh...
Could it get any worse?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.080
May I offer you a brandy?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.592
Morwenna, I am so glad you came.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.599
Lord, they're as fearless as you.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.393
Am I fearless?

22:38.480 --> 22:41.040
How else does a miner's brat
rise to be a great lady?

22:42.240 --> 22:43.594
I'm a great lady?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.117
It is why Tess do envy 'ee.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.839
Tess?
Why bring she in?

22:48.920 --> 22:50.240
Why indeed.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.199
Were it I, she'd not come within five mile
of aught I love.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.078
But you seem blind to her malice.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.595
Because I'd give her
the benefit of the doubt?

22:58.680 --> 23:00.751
I hope 'ee will not live to regret it.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.513
Mr Warleggan.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.439
Is Sir George with you?

23:07.520 --> 23:11.355
He's been called away to the North
on business.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.194
I trust he's well-armed.
I hear it's quite barbaric.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.876
Do you know Dr Penrose?
Incumbent Head of the Cornwall Infirmary?

23:18.960 --> 23:21.714
I believe another candidate
thrust himself forward.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.350
But his eccentric views
will count against him.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.669
Views?

23:26.760 --> 23:28.194
On lunacy, sir.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.752
This individual espouses methods
which go against all proven treatments.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.115
Proven, you say?

23:36.520 --> 23:38.273
May I speak with Your Ladyship?

23:43.760 --> 23:45.479
Would you excuse me?

23:49.480 --> 23:52.200
Might I consult with you, sir...

23:53.320 --> 23:54.834
...on a private matter?

23:54.920 --> 23:59.995
Lady Whitworth, would you be so kind
as to tell me how John Conan is?

24:00.080 --> 24:04.518
I see no reason to account to you
for the welfare of my grandson.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.717
Begging your pardon, ma'am.

24:13.200 --> 24:17.558
But as a mother,
if ever you felt a mother's love...

24:17.640 --> 24:19.233
...or loss...

24:23.120 --> 24:26.397
...what harm can it do
to tell her what she longs to hear?

24:36.520 --> 24:39.592
John Conan is a somewhat sickly child.

24:39.680 --> 24:44.357
He has two tutors, a fencing master,
a riding instructor and a personal physician.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.877
He's being educated
as befits a Whitworth-Godolphin

24:47.960 --> 24:52.910
and I'm confident he'll surpass
even the attainments of his eminent father.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.591
Your Ladyship is very kind.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.874
May I ask...

25:09.280 --> 25:11.636
...does he ever speak of me?

25:12.640 --> 25:14.313
Your name is never mentioned.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.679
It is best for all concerned
that both parties forget the other exists.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.639
You may rely upon me, sir.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.552
I am the soul of discretion.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.791
I wonder what business he's about now?

25:42.880 --> 25:45.111
Hunting a suitable match for you?

25:45.200 --> 25:46.600
Let's assist him.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.433
What shall we look for
in my future husband?

25:49.600 --> 25:51.319
Obscene wealth.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.869
A monstrous, grand estate.
An ancient family name.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.872
Not forgetting utter stupidity.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.520
For then he'll not notice that
I have a brain, where he does not.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.597
But then, how could you respect him?

26:01.600 --> 26:02.954
I could not.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.679
In which case...

26:04.760 --> 26:07.036
...how could he expect me
to be faithful?

26:07.120 --> 26:09.919
Lord, what a terrifying creature you are!

26:17.360 --> 26:20.478
Does your friend not find Cornwall chilly
after the jungles of Honduras?

26:24.760 --> 26:27.832
My friend has lived in England
for some time, sir.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.040
- I think she's used to the climate.
- She should make herself at home.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.278
I believe her stay will be of some duration.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.238
This is not my home, sir.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.720
Nor my husband's.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.476
Our home is the Bay. And we intend
to return there with all possible speed.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.074
I find that strange.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.470
Here, you almost pass as civilised.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.678
Whereas there, you must always be reminded
of your savage origins.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.873
My husband, before he freed me...

26:56.880 --> 26:59.031
...bought me from a man named O'Hara.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.709
O'Hara?

27:01.800 --> 27:04.156
Your overseer.

27:08.920 --> 27:12.197
My mother begged him to sell me.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.274
Because she would not have you
debauch me!

27:21.080 --> 27:22.480
I was 12!

27:35.160 --> 27:39.393
Is it not a slave's duty
to perform as directed?

27:43.240 --> 27:45.914
You should have been grateful
for my notice.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.271
As you should be grateful that the first
I hear of this is in the house of my friends,

27:54.360 --> 27:59.276
whose hospitality I will not abuse by spilling
your guts in full view of their guests.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.279
Ned, Ned...
Our motto Ned...

28:03.280 --> 28:04.280
Allow me.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.759
Now do you see why he was known
as Mad Ned in the Bay?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.360
Known by whom?

28:17.440 --> 28:19.033
His colleagues?

28:19.120 --> 28:20.952
His workers?
I think not.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.520
Nor his secretary.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.513
Who's sadly no longer with us.
But, of course, you knew that.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.670
I?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.877
- I had no notion.
- Oh...

28:29.960 --> 28:31.394
Now, why do I doubt that?

28:32.640 --> 28:35.951
Indeed, why do I think
you had a hand in his demise?

28:38.120 --> 28:40.555
I assure you, I know nothing of such.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.120
If you do not...

28:43.120 --> 28:44.440
...who does?

28:46.640 --> 28:48.518
Sir, you're standing on my foot.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.115
Oh, I do beg your pardon.
How careless of me.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.310
Urgh!

28:54.720 --> 28:57.189
Ross!
Judas, what are you thinking?

28:57.280 --> 28:59.920
- Come away! What's got into you?
- This man had Bannantine killed.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.798
Let me through,
there's been an accident!

29:01.880 --> 29:04.031
Accident at Wheal Plenty!

29:05.520 --> 29:07.239
A massive rock fall in the 30 level.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.789
Blocked main shaft.
Up to 20 miners missing.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.040
- Some of them children.
- If the main shaft's blocked,

29:12.120 --> 29:14.077
- what means of escape have they?
- None.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.629
- Oh, dear God...!
- Will the Warleggans attempt a rescue?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.030
Has word been got to Sir George yet?

29:25.240 --> 29:28.392
These will relieve the melancholic
congestion of the brain.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.676
Blistering will draw out
the noxious humours.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.158
Bleeding will expunge the mephitic matter
rioting in the bloodstream.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.550
And this decoction
of lachryma papaveris

29:39.640 --> 29:44.271
will subdue the animal spirits which have
seized the patient in their grip.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.678
From Wheal Plenty, sir.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.951
Come to commiserate, have 'ee?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.350
My Arthur trapped below grass.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.830
And you've come to make excuses
for the sins of thy ilk!

30:35.920 --> 30:37.240
What ilk?

30:37.320 --> 30:38.959
Wheal Plenty's none of ours.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.474
What difference do it make?

30:41.560 --> 30:43.358
What care any mine owner
about his slaves?

30:43.440 --> 30:44.760
About my Arthur?

30:44.840 --> 30:47.674
Well, you should know, Jacka,
since you've worked for Ross long enough

30:47.760 --> 30:50.240
and know he'd never ask you to do aught
he wouldn't do himself.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.749
All mine owners
should be taught a lesson.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.400
If they lost they mines,
they'd soon lose their fancy living.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.358
And what'd that solve?

30:57.440 --> 30:59.432
Would it not bring more misery?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.716
Don't talk to me about misery
till 'ee have lost a son.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.390
Oh, Arthur...!

31:13.000 --> 31:14.354
Bessie...

31:15.760 --> 31:17.752
Why do we never go to the sea?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.759
That will be all.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.115
Captain Poldark, sir.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.237
What do you intend to do
about Wheal Plenty?

31:43.240 --> 31:46.392
Mine Captain Carter here
has assessed the damage

31:46.480 --> 31:52.636
and regrets that any attempt to clear
the main shaft will take at least three weeks.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.400
Too late for any survivors.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.631
And the cost would be prohibitive.

31:59.680 --> 32:03.037
In Sir George's absence,
I have taken the decision...

32:04.120 --> 32:06.316
...to close the mine.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.676
- Permanently?
- Permanently.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.229
And the livelihoods of those who survived?

32:11.320 --> 32:16.759
They may thank God they're still alive
to seek employ elsewhere.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.279
This is the main shaft.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.319
Here I suspect is where the poor souls
will have fallen.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.074
This level peters out to the south.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.799
Where did it lead before it petered out?

32:38.880 --> 32:42.351
It comes out about here by the caves,
just off Tregunna Cove.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.309
Could we blast inwards,

32:46.400 --> 32:49.950
break through to the 30 level from here?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.190
It'd take precision.

32:51.280 --> 32:55.274
And we can't be sure exactly how far
we'd be from the main shaft.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.795
I have a fair idea.
And though it grieves me to say so,

32:57.880 --> 32:59.314
it's folly to even consider it.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.153
Well, I say to hell with it.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.118
Who's with me?

33:06.840 --> 33:10.390
Have you any notion
of the risks involved?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.792
Judas, Ross, it's not even our mine.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.315
So the attempt must be a secret.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.915
We've no right to interfere.
And if the Warleggans get word,

33:19.000 --> 33:20.878
they will doubtless sue us for trespass

33:20.960 --> 33:23.600
Meanwhile, I'm supposed to look
Morwenna and Caroline in the face

33:23.680 --> 33:26.115
- and pretend you've all gone fishing?
- Excellent idea.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.554
Ross, I despair of you.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.472
My love,
if it were Jeremy trapped below,

33:29.560 --> 33:31.631
would you not be begging me
to bring him home?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.832
Yes, I'd be begging you.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.038
Just promise me you won't let
Drake and Sam take any risks.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.157
I intend to leave all the risk to Ned.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.711
For a man of
Sir George's stubbornness...

34:06.800 --> 34:08.792
...conventional treatments are
of no effect.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.679
A more robust approach is
thus required.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.072
- Who knows these caves?
- I.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.391
The nearest point to the tunnel
is through here.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.395
- Do we go after them?
- There's no point.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.233
Just leave it to the Colonel.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.278
You'd like to see some books?

35:00.040 --> 35:01.474
And perhaps a piece of cake?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.354
Yeah?

35:04.440 --> 35:06.079
Fuse lit!

35:09.160 --> 35:10.640
Take cover!

35:16.880 --> 35:19.395
Right, lads, no time to lose.
Follow me.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.230
Where's my Tommy?
I want him home.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.993
He wants to learn to read.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.710
I've lost one son to greedy mine owners. I
won't lose another to highfalutin' nonsense!

35:45.800 --> 35:48.235
Jacka, until children are
taught their letters,

35:48.320 --> 35:51.597
they'll have no choice but
to risk their lives down the mine.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.160
Is that what you want for your child?

35:53.200 --> 35:56.750
- Don't 'ee tell me what's best for my child!
- Something's happening at Wheal Plenty!

35:58.080 --> 35:59.434
Come on!

36:16.080 --> 36:17.275
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.797
Now, we must cross that first.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.036
My boy.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.440
Help him.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.640
It grieves me to say it, but we'll never
reach them before the roof comes down.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.070
Let's not waste time chattering.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.799
Clear the way!

36:48.880 --> 36:50.075
No!

36:51.200 --> 36:52.554
Ned!

37:10.640 --> 37:12.200
- Ross, he knew the risk.
- Stand aside.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.873
- Consider a moment.
- No, no, no.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.749
Ross...!

37:33.000 --> 37:36.232
Next time you find me dying
on the battlefield, walk on.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.829
I could've managed it myself.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.833
But I had to find some way
to get you to cross.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.874
Make haste.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.872
- Are any alive?
- Yes.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.151
We need to find something
to bridge the gap.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.589
I want to speak to Papa.

38:23.040 --> 38:28.832
"Demand the mine owners
take steps to effect a rescue."

38:29.920 --> 38:31.832
Oh, these people...!

38:32.960 --> 38:35.111
Rescue be damned.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.717
- Are they alive?
- Some of them.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.837
It's a miracle any survived.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.359
Arthur?

38:57.440 --> 38:59.432
It's Jimmy Rogers.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.435
Billy Nanfan.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.312
Keep them props steady.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.473
Come on, boy, we've got you.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.840
Send it back.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.397
Bring him here.
Lay him down.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.073
- It's Robby Kernow.
- Fetch water

39:44.560 --> 39:46.711
- You're safe now, child.
- Make way.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.314
Are you in pain?
Can you tell me where it hurts?

39:53.240 --> 39:54.993
Dead or alive?

39:55.080 --> 39:56.196
Alive, I think.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.880
Is it Arthur?

40:05.280 --> 40:06.634
Is it my Arthur?

40:06.720 --> 40:09.110
Is he dead?
Tell me, is he dead?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.554
He's breathing.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.194
Easy, son.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.351
That's it, easy...

41:01.000 --> 41:02.719
- What happened?
- Well...

41:02.800 --> 41:05.110
Er, we might have been to Wheal Plenty,

41:05.200 --> 41:08.477
formed a rescue party
to see if there was aught to be done.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.233
And was there?

41:10.320 --> 41:12.277
14 brought out alive.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.078
And you didn't tell me you were going!

41:19.160 --> 41:20.913
Well, would 'ee have let me?

41:24.200 --> 41:27.432
Have 'ee looked outdoors lately?

41:41.960 --> 41:43.838
This is inhuman.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.151
As is the patient.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.200
A lunatic, you see, has lost all reason,
which is the essence of his humanity.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.956
His unchained animality
can only be mastered

41:54.040 --> 41:57.158
by discipline and brutalising.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.040
I swear, I could sleep for a week.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.271
Where's your backbone, man?

42:13.240 --> 42:14.913
Kitty! Demelza!

42:15.000 --> 42:17.071
- Vittles and rum!
- Why not?

42:18.320 --> 42:20.915
Look at that, a roaring fire.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.840
Forgive me if I don't share
the general euphoria.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.276
- You mislike Ned?
- On the contrary.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.920
I admire him.
I agree with everything he stands for.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.277
But what happened today
was an act of pure folly.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.431
Yes, it turned out well, thanks to Ross.

42:40.520 --> 42:43.115
But it could have ended
in utter catastrophe.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.000
Will you say this to Ross?

42:46.080 --> 42:47.958
He's not ready to hear it.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.476
In America, Ned was a hero.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.074
Or so I thought.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.800
But I begin to view
his brand of recklessness

42:55.880 --> 42:57.360
as more akin to madness.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.957
I wish I'd known, I would've helped.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.555
I'm glad you did not.
There was loss of life.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.632
You think I've not seen death?

43:13.720 --> 43:15.916
My mother nursed dying slaves.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.198
Unbeknown to my father.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.398
She sounds remarkable.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.199
She was.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.680
As is her daughter.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.270
- What's that child doing out alone?
- That's my brother.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.831
- Valentine...
- Geoffrey Charles!

43:54.840 --> 43:57.116
I come to offer my congratulations.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.398
14 souls saved at Wheal Plenty.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.392
Oh! Ah. Er...

44:02.480 --> 44:05.120
- Well...
- Another master stroke.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.399
And Cecily, being a sentimental soul,
will warm to Sir George

44:10.480 --> 44:12.631
if she believes it was his idea.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.597
Which, of course, it was.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.597
Right, now, your hand.
Not that.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.877
I hope you don't mind.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.111
We found him in the village unattended.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.991
- Valentine...
- Morwenna!

44:51.640 --> 44:53.871
You must find it rather dull
being there by yourself.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.440
Very dull.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.749
Well...

44:59.120 --> 45:01.510
Jeremy, Clowance, come.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.876
Here's two friends you can play with.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.679
Pleased to meet you.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.638
Pleased to meet you, too.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.120
Good boy.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.517
Since Miss Hanson is
with you in Truro...

46:11.520 --> 46:13.477
The moment Sir George returns,

46:13.560 --> 46:18.237
we will move matters forward
with all possible speed.

46:46.480 --> 46:51.032
♪ I do hold a finger to my tongue

46:52.520 --> 46:58.039
♪ I do hold a finger waiting

46:58.120 --> 47:05.120
♪ My heart is sore until it joins in song

47:06.720 --> 47:11.920
♪ With your heart mating. ♪

48:56.640 --> 48:58.393
Why did you do that?

49:01.720 --> 49:03.996
I thought you were about to fall.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.273
Would it matter?

49:15.200 --> 49:19.353
I wonder, would you allow me
to accompany you back to Trenwith?

49:33.640 --> 49:34.756
Er...

49:40.480 --> 49:43.200
Would you excuse me a moment?

49:52.120 --> 49:53.395
Lucy...

49:53.480 --> 49:54.675
Away.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.240
May I ask how Sir George
came by these injuries?

50:17.880 --> 50:19.394
They're not injuries, sir.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.635
They are the result of prescribed
interventions for his condition.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.393
Which is?

50:26.480 --> 50:29.200
Call yourself an expert
on mental conditions?

50:29.280 --> 50:31.954
Sir George is quite clearly
in the grip of animal spirits.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.714
What other <i>interventions</i>
has he suffered?

50:34.800 --> 50:38.555
My nephew has been frozen, burnt,
blistered, drowned and shackled.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.120
And you permit this?

50:40.200 --> 50:43.910
My concern was to have my nephew cured
as quickly as possible

50:44.000 --> 50:46.595
and to keep his illness a secret.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.320
Sir George is clearly suffering
from the acute distress

50:50.400 --> 50:52.119
of losing a beloved wife.

50:52.200 --> 50:55.238
He requires kindness and patience.
The only lunatic in this room is there.

51:00.440 --> 51:03.035
For the sake of your nephew,
I beg you, dispense with this brute.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.840
His methods will induce madness,
not cure it.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.753
Come on, you two, time for bed.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.354
- Ross...
- Hm?

51:24.440 --> 51:26.875
- The child needs to go home.
- I'll take him.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.076
Goodnight, Papa.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.389
I'll keep you company.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.756
After all, Trenwith is my house.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.230
- And if George objects, I'll...
- I'll come, too

51:34.320 --> 51:36.676
I'd like to see
your "monstrous, grand estate".

51:40.160 --> 51:42.152
Well, I, er... don't wish to keep you.

51:43.120 --> 51:46.158
It's almost as if
you're trying to get rid of me.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.240
Oh!

51:47.320 --> 51:49.960
- The very idea...
- Look who brought me home.

51:51.240 --> 51:54.278
Home?
From where? Where have you been?

51:54.360 --> 51:57.990
He was found wandering alone
in Sawle village.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.311
Did no-one realise he was missing?

52:03.040 --> 52:04.793
Do you think she would have liked me?

52:06.720 --> 52:09.599
I think she would have found you...

52:09.680 --> 52:11.273
Unruly?

52:12.400 --> 52:14.756
- Unladylike?
- A little.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.879
But she loved me.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.640
And would have made it her business
to love anyone I...

52:24.840 --> 52:26.559
...admire.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.597
Think highly of.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.280
<i>Does George not care
about the welfare of his son?</i>

52:39.360 --> 52:43.195
Sir George is away
in the North of England.

52:43.280 --> 52:46.079
No, he isn't!
He's upstairs. I've seen him.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.880
Good evening.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.040
Papa!

52:58.360 --> 53:00.716
- I was not expecting...
- No.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.473
I see that.

53:04.720 --> 53:08.555
I must congratulate you, sir,
on the daring rescue at Wheal Plenty.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.240
Sir George has written...

53:13.960 --> 53:18.512
...offering the use of our town house
in Truro for the duration of your stay.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.400
Well, that's very generous of him.

53:23.800 --> 53:27.350
But Cecily and I
will be travelling to Bristol...

53:28.560 --> 53:31.155
- ...where I have business.
- Oh, must we...?

53:31.240 --> 53:34.916
Since Sir George
is in such a benevolent mood,

53:35.000 --> 53:39.392
perhaps he'd care to fund his stepson's
first year at the military academy.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.237
- Oh, I, er...
- Since he can well afford it.

53:44.480 --> 53:46.278
To whom should the note be made payable?

54:06.360 --> 54:08.920
Did Ross ever tell you of James Creek?

54:10.400 --> 54:12.073
Where he got his scar.

54:13.240 --> 54:14.799
He never mentions it.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.280
Ned does.

54:17.360 --> 54:21.320
The skirmishes they fought.
The ambushes they plotted.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.793
How they egged each other on.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.112
How they came to think of themselves
as invincible.

54:31.720 --> 54:34.235
Do you wonder why it took me so long
to come to you?

54:35.440 --> 54:38.399
Do you think I didn't look
for a less impetuous man

54:38.480 --> 54:40.312
to champion my husband?

54:44.240 --> 54:46.550
But none stepped forth, so...

54:46.640 --> 54:48.677
...I took his offer gratefully.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.670
So I know what it is you fear.

54:54.840 --> 54:58.356
That apart they can be restrained
or reasoned with.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.750
But set them together
and one of these days...

55:01.760 --> 55:04.195
They'll bring the whole world down
upon their heads.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.392
Consider this a loan.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.711
Convey our gratitude to Sir George.

55:34.480 --> 55:36.199
Geoffrey Charles!

55:38.640 --> 55:40.313
Will you come again, brother?

55:40.400 --> 55:41.675
Gladly.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.235
- May I visit you again?
- If you like.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.909
Is it my fault that Bannantine died?

56:32.960 --> 56:35.191
- If I'd never given out those pamphlets.
- My love...

56:36.440 --> 56:38.796
...neither of us could have known
what we were dealing with.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.914
But Wickham...

56:49.880 --> 56:52.076
When he bid you report on Ned...

56:53.560 --> 56:55.552
...what matter of act did he mean?

56:55.640 --> 56:57.359
Openly treasonable?

56:58.960 --> 57:01.077
Or random acts

57:01.160 --> 57:04.198
as might betray a reckless...

57:05.480 --> 57:07.073
...or unbiddable nature?

57:07.160 --> 57:09.880
Such as happened today at the mine
and Killewarren.

57:11.560 --> 57:14.439
That in itself could not be construed
as seditious.

57:15.480 --> 57:18.279
But it concerns me how volatile and...

57:19.280 --> 57:20.555
...impetuous Ned is.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.235
Whereas you are the soul of restraint

57:31.160 --> 57:32.799
But Wickham need not know.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.877
If you do not tell him.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.429
He'll not hear it from me.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.637
But from someone else, he might.
