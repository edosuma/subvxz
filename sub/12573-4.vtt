00:06.680 --> 00:07.850
I tracked it for days.

00:07.860 --> 00:08.900
It's my trophy.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.590
I ran the animal to the ground and

00:10.600 --> 00:12.680
Watched it die. The trophy is mine.

00:12.690 --> 00:15.510
He's lying, confessor. He only wounded the creature.

00:15.570 --> 00:17.400
It was my arrow that killed it.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:29.440 --> 00:31.160
I can see that neither of you is sure

00:31.170 --> 00:33.240
Whose arrow truly killed the creature

00:33.700 --> 00:36.210
So I can't fairly award the trophy to either of you.

00:36.220 --> 00:37.960
Is there someone you both know who could use

00:37.970 --> 00:40.460
The health and good luck such a trophy would bring

00:42.110 --> 00:43.750
Gethin's wife has been ill.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.060
Then give the trophy to gethin, and forgive each other for this feud.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.460
Yes, confessor.

00:51.470 --> 00:52.640
Thank you.

00:55.870 --> 00:58.050
As you both agreed to abide by the covenant

00:58.060 --> 01:00.490
Of the confessor, I will now hear your dispute

01:00.500 --> 01:03.510
There are more people here now than there were when we got here.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.140
Patience, richard.

01:06.380 --> 01:09.040
This valley hasn't seen a confessor in years.

01:09.050 --> 01:11.190
Do you have any idea how much bad blood can flow

01:11.200 --> 01:13.310
When people have no one to settle their disputes

01:13.400 --> 01:15.050
How does she know who's telling the truth?

01:15.060 --> 01:17.600
A confessor has power beyond her magic.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.230
She often senses the truth without using her touch.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.530
She can ferret out lies,

01:21.540 --> 01:23.900
And heal the rifts that come from keeping secrets

01:24.360 --> 01:26.240
And everybody just does what she says?

01:26.250 --> 01:29.910
A confessor is the highest moral authority in the midlands.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.800
People abide by her judgments.

01:31.810 --> 01:32.860
Richard.

01:32.870 --> 01:34.610
Matthias and I are heading out on a hunt.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.850
Probably no more than a day's ride.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.260
We'd be honored to have a seeker accompany. What are you hunting?

01:38.270 --> 01:40.370
Worthy prey. A 14-point buck.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.150
Richard can't. What?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.490
Excuse us.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.950
You can't just ride off on your own.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.290
Back in hartland, I was on my own all the time, sometimes for days.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.830
That was before you were the seeker.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.760
Before darken rahl wanted to kill you.

01:53.770 --> 01:56.660
Gavin and matthias will be with me. It's not safe.

01:56.670 --> 02:00.000
Lesson number 15: "in honoring what others

02:00.010 --> 02:02.500
Most honor, the seeker shall win their hearts.

02:02.510 --> 02:05.760
Hunting is their most honored tradition.

02:05.770 --> 02:08.530
Oh, so when it's convenient, you remember your lessons.

02:08.539 --> 02:10.280
Kahlan will be busy for days.

02:10.289 --> 02:12.850
Zeddicus zu'l zorander.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.550
It is you.

02:17.450 --> 02:22.410
I heard there was a wizard in the camp, but I hardly dared to imagine.

02:22.980 --> 02:27.420
You promised you would never forget that night at the fire springs.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.770
Sylvia!

02:33.430 --> 02:36.480
If I recall, it was more than one night.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.660
So we're agreed, then. Hm.

02:38.670 --> 02:41.610
You'll spend time with your friend, and I'll go hunting.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.970
Which way are you going?

02:42.980 --> 02:44.720
The stag was seen heading east.

02:44.730 --> 02:49.370
Remember, not everyone in the midlands is friendly. Be careful.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.940
You too.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.060
This is one crafty stag.

03:09.070 --> 03:12.120
Now he's turn west. Then let's go west.

03:21.790 --> 03:23.690
I thought we were leagues from the nearest town.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.090
The stag has led us further than I thought.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.830
That's Brennidon, I think.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.140
Brennidon?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.760
You know it?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.040
I was born there.

03:34.670 --> 03:37.120
I'm surprised zedd didn't tell me we were close by.

03:37.130 --> 03:38.280
You weren't.

03:38.290 --> 03:40.610
He didn't expect us to be riding west.

03:41.540 --> 03:42.970
How long since you've been there?

03:43.170 --> 03:44.940
Not since I was a baby.

03:46.390 --> 03:51.020
I wonder which house was mine, where my parents lived.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.650
Do your parents still live there?

03:54.700 --> 03:55.840
I don't know.

03:55.850 --> 03:57.230
Don't you wanna find out?

03:59.690 --> 04:02.380
Uh, I told zedd I'd stay with you.

04:05.390 --> 04:09.870
But it wouldn't hurt to take a look around for an hour or so.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.700
And maybe we'll have taken the stag by the time you catch up with us.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.110
All right.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.410
A terrible sight, isn't it?

04:42.130 --> 04:43.540
Who are they?

04:43.660 --> 04:45.830
The firstborn sons of brennidon,

04:47.010 --> 04:51.290
Murdered by darken rahl's men to avert a prophecy

04:59.660 --> 05:01.440
The prophecy of the seeker.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.260
You know of it?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.990
I've heard the story.

05:06.710 --> 05:10.210
You've heard of it? It's not just a story.

05:11.170 --> 05:17.160
All these children were murdered because of it, the seeker among them.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.580
And when he died, so did brennidon's future.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.340
Maybe the seeker's out there somewhere,

05:27.810 --> 05:30.540
Ready to rise up and defeat darken rahl

05:33.300 --> 05:36.810
Twenty-three years have gone by and

05:36.820 --> 05:39.310
Rahl is advancing through the midlands

05:41.060 --> 05:43.060
No seeker has surfaced.

05:45.600 --> 05:52.130
So if he lives, he's a coward, and our children have died for nothing.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.020
Legend of the Seeker S01E04 Brennidon

06:02.900 --> 06:05.100
-Papers, please. -All right, clear.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.760
-Come on, who's next? -come on.

06:08.260 --> 06:09.770
Come on, move along.

06:10.490 --> 06:11.890
Keep walking.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.080
You. Where's your pass?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.550
Pass?

06:21.700 --> 06:23.790
No pass, no entry.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.100
Who's next?

06:34.110 --> 06:35.700
Keep moving.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.960
All right, clear.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.610
Okay, show me your papers.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.940
Keep moving.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.340
Move along.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.070
Keep to the main square, now.

07:10.630 --> 07:16.120
This young woman has been preaching heresy.

07:16.340 --> 07:20.290
Gathering her friends, telling them that lord rahl is not our true leader.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.050
We all know the consequences of defying lord rahl.

07:26.830 --> 07:30.740
So for the past 20 years, you have chosen to live by certain standards.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.690
Allowing those of us from the patrol to protect you.

07:35.020 --> 07:39.390
This girl thinks she knows better than the town elders.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.350
We must cast rebels out publicly so

07:41.360 --> 07:44.990
Lord rahl knows we will never defy him again

07:48.500 --> 07:53.040
May your rebellious spirit wander the underworld for all time.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.500
Stop!

07:56.070 --> 07:58.460
You can't kill her just for speaking her mind.

07:58.470 --> 08:00.610
Who are you? Show me your papers.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.280
Just let her go. This doesn't have to be a fight.

08:03.290 --> 08:04.410
Take him.

08:11.810 --> 08:13.140
The sword of truth.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.150
It's the seeker!

08:19.620 --> 08:20.910
Arrest him!

08:28.630 --> 08:30.260
Run, hide yourself!

08:55.520 --> 08:58.430
Alert the sentries! Close the gates!

09:08.410 --> 09:09.580
Split into two.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.160
Go around the other side.

09:19.510 --> 09:21.220
I want to help you.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.100
Follow me.

09:29.810 --> 09:31.490
The seeker went this way.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.590
Thank you for helping me.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.480
Look at you.

09:49.030 --> 09:50.300
You know me?

09:51.540 --> 09:55.450
I held you in my arms the night you were born,

09:57.400 --> 09:59.740
And then the wizard took you away

10:05.640 --> 10:06.940
Are you saying...

10:07.900 --> 10:09.340
...You're my mother?

10:16.630 --> 10:17.960
Yes.

10:22.660 --> 10:27.090
If you surrender the army, it's going to upset the townspeople.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.770
We had an agreement that if we submitted to Darken Rahl's rule,

10:29.770 --> 10:31.920
Brennidon would remain three of your forces

10:32.120 --> 10:34.170
The agreement was not for your benefit.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.000
Lord rahl felt occupying the town

10:36.010 --> 10:38.080
Might discourage the seeker from returning

10:38.100 --> 10:41.650
Your part of the bargain was to deliver him to us if he did come back.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.490
I alerted you as soon as I knew-- you alerted me

10:43.500 --> 10:45.710
Only after the seeker had slipped through your fingers

10:46.740 --> 10:48.870
Now I have no choice but to bring in my own forces.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.470
Wait. Give us some time.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.500
The seeker is within the city walls. He could not have escaped.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.490
We're searching every house in brennidon.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.880
He will be in your hands before nightfall.

11:01.170 --> 11:02.650
He had better be.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.830
I called you owen, after your father.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.510
My father?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.640
He passed away. Not long after.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.260
Did the wizard give you to good people?

11:19.330 --> 11:20.550
Very good people.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.630
I can see they've raised a fine man.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.810
What you did to save that girl-- well, they were going to kill her.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.400
And everyone was just going to stand around and watch?

11:29.410 --> 11:31.350
People are terrified of darken rahl.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.590
I don't understand.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.740
Rahl didn't kill the children of this town because you

11:36.750 --> 11:41.280
Defied his edicts-- rahl gave a warning before the massacre

11:41.630 --> 11:43.810
He asked the town elders to identify

11:43.820 --> 11:47.700
Which child was the seeker, turn him over

11:48.710 --> 11:50.180
They refused.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.690
So rahl massacred all the children.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.400
And now people are scared that if they anger rahl,

12:00.410 --> 12:03.940
Even in the slightest way, he'll send his assassins back

12:03.950 --> 12:07.490
So you let these patrols control everything you do and say?

12:07.500 --> 12:11.750
Many of us think that it's wrong to give up our freedom to appease Rahl,

12:11.760 --> 12:15.070
But you saw what happens to the people that speak out

12:16.400 --> 12:22.360
But now the seeker is back, ready to fulfill his destiny.

12:26.660 --> 12:29.280
And maybe, now that you're here,

12:29.290 --> 12:32.830
The rest of us will find the strength to stand with you

12:37.900 --> 12:38.900
Mom.

12:38.910 --> 12:40.650
They're saying the seeker is in town.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.290
But the seeker was killed.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.740
No, mark, he wasn't.

12:49.130 --> 12:50.570
This is richard.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.340
He's the seeker.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.140
I'm your brother.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.820
I'm glad you're back, zedd.

13:09.270 --> 13:11.680
I'm afraid I won't be staying, my dear.

13:11.690 --> 13:12.760
Of course.

13:12.770 --> 13:15.490
You've always had some higher calling to follow.

13:15.610 --> 13:20.010
This search for a mythical creature, that hunt for a lost spell.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.050
Well, at least your excuses for leaving

13:23.060 --> 13:25.580
Were always more interesting than most men's.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.000
But this time, your duty lies here.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.510
What do you mean?

13:37.040 --> 13:38.390
Allard?

13:41.730 --> 13:46.080
Zedd, I want you to meet allard.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.980
Your son.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.630
My mother never said my father was agreat wizard.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.400
I'm not your father.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.750
Of course you are.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.490
He's got your coloring.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.400
Your eyes.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.230
Every time I look at him, I see you.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.360
You must be under an illusion spell.

14:11.370 --> 14:13.430
It's your duty as his father to train

14:13.440 --> 14:15.130
Him and teach him the ways of the world

14:15.140 --> 14:16.890
He's a grown man.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.090
Who you abandoned.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.630
He's no child of mine!

14:19.640 --> 14:21.280
I took precautions.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.320
Magical precautions.

14:24.940 --> 14:27.010
Maybe I should wait outside.

14:28.020 --> 14:30.480
You were in the throes of passion.

14:30.480 --> 14:35.450
By the time you'd even thought of taking precautions-- he's not my son!

14:36.310 --> 14:37.840
And I'll prove it.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.260
How?

14:41.350 --> 14:42.970
Confess us.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.000
About what?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.950
It's a matter of...

14:50.840 --> 14:52.170
...Paternity.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.770
You told me my brother was dead.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.360
Everyone needed to think he was dead until

14:58.370 --> 15:01.070
He could fulfill his destiny as the seeker

15:01.080 --> 15:02.450
If anyone knew he'd survived,

15:02.460 --> 15:04.640
Darken rahl would have pursued him to the edge of the world.

15:04.650 --> 15:07.140
If they find him here, they'll execute all of us.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.740
They're searching the houses now.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.980
He's right.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.040
I have to leave.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.100
I don't want you to go.

15:12.110 --> 15:15.220
I'll go back and find my friends, tell them what happened in Brennidon.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.630
We'll find a way to help you.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.220
Come on, keep searching!

15:18.870 --> 15:20.210
You know the patrols, mark.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.250
Couldn't you get one of them to help us?

15:22.930 --> 15:24.410
Please, mark.

15:27.770 --> 15:30.840
I could hide him until nightfall, maybe ask the gatekeeper.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.650
I might be able to get him to look the other way.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.910
This one!

15:35.030 --> 15:36.270
Come on.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.180
You won't find anything here.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.750
Down here!

15:49.760 --> 15:50.980
Okay.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.280
Move along. Keep walking.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.420
This place has been empty for years.

16:05.390 --> 16:06.840
No one comes here.

16:08.710 --> 16:11.470
You'll be safe in the cellar.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.530
Thanks for your help.

16:21.550 --> 16:23.270
I'm not trying to help you.

16:24.290 --> 16:26.210
Mark! Don't do this!

16:26.560 --> 16:27.850
Mark!

16:34.800 --> 16:36.130
Did you see the seeker?

16:36.140 --> 16:38.440
Come on, move along,keeping walking

16:39.400 --> 16:41.080
Please, you have to come.

16:41.090 --> 16:43.240
I've caught the seeker. This way.

16:43.340 --> 16:44.680
How could a boy like you capture him?

16:44.690 --> 16:46.640
He defeated my best men. So I tricked him.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.520
Please, I can take you there.

17:22.010 --> 17:23.660
Well, where is he?

17:34.060 --> 17:37.600
And there's no possibility of anyone else being allard's father?

17:38.820 --> 17:42.740
There was another man, uh, steffan, but I only saw him once.

17:42.750 --> 17:46.250
Aha! Vixen. This steffan must be the father.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.900
Or it could be you.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.440
It's your turn.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.560
Are you allard's father?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.950
I used protection.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.930
Magical protection.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.130
And this magic, could it have failed?

18:04.140 --> 18:05.070
Never.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.110
It's my own spell. It's foolproof.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.470
And you used it every time?

18:11.890 --> 18:17.220
Zedd, you're honor bound to tell a confessor the truth.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.800
Not in front of her.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.000
Leave us.

18:29.950 --> 18:32.580
Was there an occasion when you didn't use your magic?

18:35.670 --> 18:39.850
Zedd, unless you're completely truthful, unless you confess whatever it

18:39.860 --> 18:41.250
Is that you're hiding,

18:41.260 --> 18:44.230
I can't absolve you of your responsibility to allard.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.820
We'll gather more men.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.100
We'll search the houses again.

18:52.110 --> 18:54.100
And whoever hid him will hide him again.

18:54.650 --> 18:56.480
Nobody in Brennidon would dare.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.380
Someone hid him 23 years ago.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.490
Think, andrew.

19:01.730 --> 19:05.250
Who would feel such loyalty to the seeker?

19:07.330 --> 19:09.160
His mother, perhaps?

19:09.270 --> 19:11.980
But we don't know who the seeker's mother is.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.980
We can find out.

19:21.740 --> 19:23.060
You there.

19:23.670 --> 19:25.020
Where are you going?

19:25.200 --> 19:26.340
The seeker may have escaped.

19:26.350 --> 19:28.520
I have orders to search outside the gate.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.400
We've received new orders.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.990
The patrols are to gather the mothers of

19:32.000 --> 19:34.520
The firstborn and take them to the town square

19:36.510 --> 19:37.860
The mothers?

19:37.880 --> 19:39.820
To force the seeker out of hiding.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.960
I helped you! Leave her alone!

20:00.690 --> 20:02.800
Zedd is not allard's father.

20:05.990 --> 20:10.300
But he was hiding something-- yes, but that didn't concern your dispute.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.540
This is my final judgment.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.920
Yes, confessor.

20:21.620 --> 20:25.430
I'm sorry, zedd. I-- I really hoped that you were allard's father.

20:25.880 --> 20:30.170
I thought he might be happier with you.

20:32.460 --> 20:33.730
Why?

20:34.330 --> 20:35.900
He doesn't even know me.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.640
Wizards are strong.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.880
Their strength comes from their minds, not their bodies.

20:42.110 --> 20:47.110
She doesn't want to say this, but I'm hopeless as a hunter.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.200
That's not true.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.020
As a child, you were fearless.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.020
Did something happen to make you fearful?

20:55.950 --> 20:57.270
What was it?

20:59.420 --> 21:03.520
A boar hunt. You never went on a boar hunt. I was only 8.

21:04.270 --> 21:06.150
You'd have said I was too young.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.470
But I went with rolant and merrick.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.540
I got caught between them and the boar, and...

21:18.560 --> 21:20.110
I was so scared.

21:21.110 --> 21:23.080
You didn't lose your skills.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.980
You were just frightened.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.030
It doesn't matter.

21:27.730 --> 21:32.080
If I'm asked on a hunt, I can't.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.980
I think I can help you.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.690
Hurry, there. Don't delay.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.890
Move along.

21:45.090 --> 21:46.190
Brigid!

21:47.530 --> 21:48.880
Brigid!

22:02.200 --> 22:04.350
The d'harans. They've come back.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.380
D'harans.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.970
What I want is simple.

22:33.950 --> 22:37.720
Give the seeker to me.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.610
Then everyone can go back to their lives.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.470
What happened here 23 years ago was a tragedy.

22:54.480 --> 22:58.260
But it was necessary for the greater good.

23:05.090 --> 23:06.840
He speaks the truth.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.920
I think we've all seen that darken rahl

23:13.930 --> 23:16.690
Will do anything to bring peace to the midlands

23:17.250 --> 23:18.500
See?

23:18.830 --> 23:20.800
This woman is wise.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.520
Listen to her.

23:23.590 --> 23:25.550
What was lord rahl to do?

23:27.500 --> 23:30.060
Face the seeker as a grown man who could

23:30.070 --> 23:32.520
Defend himself and carry out the prophecy

23:34.140 --> 23:35.380
No.

23:35.430 --> 23:37.650
He had to kill our children!

23:39.800 --> 23:42.740
The seeker stood up to the patrols this morning.

23:42.990 --> 23:45.120
He saved a girl's life.

23:46.270 --> 23:48.440
No one else has had the courage to do that.

23:49.230 --> 23:52.530
If we betray the seeker because we are afraid,

23:52.540 --> 23:55.810
Then the children of brennidon died for nothing

24:01.880 --> 24:03.260
Silence her!

24:03.280 --> 24:05.270
I'm the one you're looking for!

24:06.550 --> 24:08.760
I am the seeker's mother!

24:09.280 --> 24:11.610
But I will never help you find him.

24:11.730 --> 24:12.850
Arrest her!

24:12.860 --> 24:14.190
No!

24:16.390 --> 24:18.070
She's protecting me.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.840
The seeker is my son.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.190
Not hers.

24:23.770 --> 24:25.210
He's my son.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.920
No, I am the seeker's mother!

24:27.930 --> 24:30.060
No, he's my son! He's my son.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.470
No, he's my son!

24:39.440 --> 24:41.650
He's mine. He's my son.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.960
Arrest them all!

24:47.490 --> 24:54.000
The seeker has until sunrise to turn himself in.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.060
If he does not, I will kill one of these women.

24:59.880 --> 25:04.800
And I will kill another for every hour that the seeker is not found!

25:07.270 --> 25:08.550
Clear the way!

25:13.140 --> 25:14.410
Mother!

25:26.210 --> 25:29.940
Mark? Don't call for the patrol. Just listen to me.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.970
I need your help.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.190
My mother was arrested because of you.

25:36.210 --> 25:38.170
Why would I help you?

25:38.290 --> 25:39.610
To save her.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.430
There only way to do that is to turn yourself in.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.140
And then what?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.870
You go back to your life?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.710
Your mother comes home and everything returns to normal?

25:51.720 --> 25:52.890
Yes.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.820
You heard what your mother said back in the town square.

25:57.260 --> 26:00.280
Your mother wants a better life for you.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.390
She wants the people of Brennidon to stand up for themselves.

26:03.400 --> 26:07.530
If I turn myself in, her sacrifice means nothing.

26:08.530 --> 26:12.010
The only thing the d'harans care about is the seeker.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.760
Once you're gone-- then the d'harans will go too?

26:37.030 --> 26:41.790
I'd never even heard of the d'harans until they killed my father.

26:46.940 --> 26:50.520
And I have another brother, back in hartland.

26:50.700 --> 26:51.870
Michael.

26:52.650 --> 26:54.270
I love him.

26:54.350 --> 26:56.550
But the d'harans turned him against me.

26:57.110 --> 26:59.790
So now I know exactly what they're capable of.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.480
And I know that giving in won't stop them.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.290
What do you want me to do?

27:16.670 --> 27:19.580
After he escaped from the cellar, I searched for him everywhere.

27:20.660 --> 27:22.660
I couldn't let him destroy Brennidon.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.370
You've done well.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.370
You have what you wanted.

27:32.370 --> 27:33.810
Now let the women go.

27:34.970 --> 27:36.510
And why should I do that?

27:36.870 --> 27:38.500
They've all defied lord rahl.

27:38.510 --> 27:41.730
Please. They were only trying to protect me.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.880
I truly am the seeker's mother.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.020
Maybe.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.430
Or maybe you're just protecting the others.

27:47.670 --> 27:51.140
Either way, they all defied lord rahl and must be punished.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.000
She's telling the truth.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.570
She is the seeker's mother.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.740
And she's the one who's tried to hide him from you.

28:03.130 --> 28:04.640
How do you know this, boy?

28:12.250 --> 28:14.060
Because she's my mother too.

28:16.510 --> 28:18.300
You would betray your own mother?

28:19.390 --> 28:21.490
She betrayed Brennidon.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.170
She's not my mother anymore.

28:27.190 --> 28:28.170
Mark!

28:28.180 --> 28:31.100
These other women, they were just being foolish,

28:32.700 --> 28:34.600
Trying to help a misguided friend

28:46.940 --> 28:49.060
You're a very capable young man.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.980
And to show the people of this town that lord Rahl is merciful,

28:53.750 --> 28:55.480
I will release the other women.

28:55.490 --> 28:58.960
You, however, will die alongside your son.

29:02.850 --> 29:05.060
Lord rahl will be pleased by your loyalty.

29:05.370 --> 29:06.790
You will be rewarded.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.410
There's only one thing I want.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.070
To be there when you kill him.

29:13.090 --> 29:14.530
You'll have a place of honor.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.000
At my side.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.430
Open the gates, spread the word.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.770
I want everyone in Brennidon and the outlying countryside in attendance.

29:23.030 --> 29:25.740
I will kill the seeker at midday.

29:28.430 --> 29:33.750
I want you to summon the fear that you've held for so long.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.420
Bring it to the surface.

29:38.130 --> 29:41.080
Concentrate on the flames.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.720
That's good, allard.

29:49.640 --> 29:54.110
Now think about how helpless you felt when the boar attacked you.

29:55.130 --> 29:58.030
Feed your fear to the fire.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.030
The fire consumes your fear.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.640
That's good, allard.

30:20.280 --> 30:25.590
And with the flames, so goes your fear.

30:29.970 --> 30:31.870
Are you sure it worked?

30:32.080 --> 30:35.720
You question the magic of a wizard of the first order?

30:35.770 --> 30:37.630
No, zedd, of course not.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.170
I was right to come to you.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.160
What kind of spell was that?

30:49.520 --> 30:50.850
It wasn't a spell.

30:50.860 --> 30:51.980
I made it up.

30:51.990 --> 30:55.050
Allard couldn't let go of his fear until

30:55.060 --> 30:56.900
I made him think magic had driven it out

30:57.240 --> 30:58.940
He may not believe it himself,

30:58.950 --> 31:01.790
But he believes in the power of a great wizard

31:02.620 --> 31:04.830
You're a crafty old devil, zedd.

31:07.990 --> 31:10.650
I'm sorry I had to make you tell me something you didn't want to.

31:11.050 --> 31:13.710
I've kept that secret buried for 20 years.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.600
I'd like it to remain buried.

31:15.930 --> 31:19.610
And by your honor as a confessor, you must never tell richard.

31:31.070 --> 31:32.360
Richard...

31:35.340 --> 31:39.750
...No matter what happens, I'm so glad that I got to see you.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.360
We're going to get out of here.

31:41.370 --> 31:42.740
I don't think so.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.080
I have a plan.

31:44.090 --> 31:45.300
Mark's agreed to help me.

31:45.310 --> 31:47.240
I've told him exactly what he needs to do.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.650
Mark betrayed you.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.490
He betrayed both of us.

31:52.990 --> 31:57.190
Mark needs to be at the platform at the execution.

31:57.770 --> 32:00.900
Oh, but his eyes, they were so cold.

32:03.070 --> 32:06.170
His whole life, he's listened to what the patrols preach.

32:06.180 --> 32:08.600
He thinks he's keeping Brennidon safe.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.790
Until now, i-- I didn't realize what

32:12.800 --> 32:14.850
Growing up in this town had done to him

32:15.140 --> 32:16.580
Listen to me.

32:17.010 --> 32:19.510
What mark did was a trick.

32:20.260 --> 32:23.090
And mark would do anything to save you.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.750
This is a horrible thing for a mother to say about her own child,

32:28.750 --> 32:32.030
But I don't know if he's strong enough

32:34.890 --> 32:39.440
What if instead of tricking the d'haran, he was really tricking you?

32:49.940 --> 32:51.310
Rabbits?

32:51.400 --> 32:54.360
Where's that stag? I'm hungry for venison.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.840
It was craftier than we thought.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.560
And there were only two of us tracking it.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.460
We'll get it next time. Only two?

33:00.470 --> 33:02.750
Where's richard? He's not back?

33:02.970 --> 33:05.360
He must have decided to stay longer in Brennidon.

33:07.730 --> 33:08.970
Brennidon?

33:10.270 --> 33:12.570
You said you were traveling east.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.030
Brennidon's west, leagues from here.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.540
Well, the stag turned west...

33:17.550 --> 33:20.160
Zedd, you said richard was just going hunting.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.720
Darken rahl knows the seeker is from Brennidon.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.690
He could have men waiting there for him.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.920
Why didn't you warn him?

33:25.930 --> 33:28.550
Because he'the most stubborn young man I've ever met.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.990
If I told him we were near Brennidon,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.880
No amount of cajoling would have convinced him not to go

33:31.890 --> 33:34.960
And Brennidon is the last place the seeker should be.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.520
Move along.

33:56.170 --> 33:57.400
Come on, people.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.870
Why is there such a crowd?

34:02.140 --> 34:04.110
What goes on here, friend?

34:04.120 --> 34:06.410
The d'harans have captured the seeker.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.400
He dies at midday.

34:09.150 --> 34:10.679
Hyah! Make room!

34:10.690 --> 34:12.510
Make room! Make room!

34:27.560 --> 34:33.090
You will watch your son die, as you should have 23 years ago.

34:37.070 --> 34:39.780
And then you will die for your treachery.

34:46.810 --> 34:50.810
The legend of the seeker seems to be greater than the man.

34:52.929 --> 34:55.699
That legend will live on if you kill me.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.210
I am going to kill you, seeker...

35:04.530 --> 35:07.760
...With your own sword.

35:15.670 --> 35:20.300
Now, seeker, the prophecy, at last, is averted.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.160
Now!

35:37.690 --> 35:38.770
Go!

37:16.210 --> 37:18.050
You were wrong, d'haran.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.160
The prophecy was not averted.

38:03.550 --> 38:05.060
Mark.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.550
I would never truly betray you.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.080
You were supposed to stay with the hunters.

38:27.090 --> 38:28.570
What were you thinking?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.840
You promised you wouldn't go off on your own.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.310
I didn't intend to.

38:32.340 --> 38:36.030
But if I hadn't have come here, I wouldn't have found my mother.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.440
Your mother is alive?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.360
Brigid.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.290
Zedd.

38:58.210 --> 39:02.090
I knew that if you turned up, I would have to tell the truth.

39:05.610 --> 39:09.540
Richard, I'm sorry.

39:09.930 --> 39:18.040
I will always love you like a son, but I'm not really your mother.

39:26.290 --> 39:30.060
I did hold you as a baby, the night you were born.

39:32.230 --> 39:35.170
I was the midwife at your birth.

39:37.100 --> 39:40.360
I was there when zedd took you from your mother's arms.

39:42.550 --> 39:44.060
Why did you pretend?

39:46.360 --> 39:50.130
When you asked me if I was your mother, I didn't mean to say yes.

39:51.290 --> 39:56.480
But it was suddenly as if I was looking at my own lost son...

39:57.370 --> 39:58.770
...Owen.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.620
The d'harans killed him.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.110
He was 3.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.380
I'm so sorry.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.140
I couldn't bear to think about his death.

40:13.580 --> 40:16.000
I imagined that he was the one that had survived.

40:16.010 --> 40:18.540
So when I saw you in the square,

40:18.550 --> 40:22.690
It was-- it was like my owen had returned

40:24.120 --> 40:26.620
At least now, I know that he didn't die for nothing.

40:29.850 --> 40:32.660
What about my real mother...?

40:34.700 --> 40:35.220
No, no.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.960
She was very ill for a while, but she lived.

40:38.410 --> 40:40.760
And then one day, she disappeared.

40:41.810 --> 40:43.770
I never saw her again.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.670
I think she went to look for you.

40:54.710 --> 40:56.610
The d'harans may return, mark.

40:56.660 --> 40:58.240
And I won't be here to help.

40:58.930 --> 41:01.330
If the d'harans return, they'll get a fight.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.530
You've taught us to stand up for ourselves.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.340
Besides, you're the seeker.

41:07.810 --> 41:10.300
You've got bigger things to do than look after one town.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.650
Take care of your mother.

41:15.090 --> 41:16.430
You know I will.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.560
You were right. About what?

41:37.630 --> 41:40.030
Insisting on the lessons. The training.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.480
I know I've been pushing you-- and now I understand why.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.760
What I saw in Brennidon made me realize what I'm facing.

41:47.410 --> 41:49.610
And I'm going to do whatever it takes to be ready.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.700
And now that I know that my mother is alive...

41:53.250 --> 41:55.190
When all this is over, I'm going to find her.

41:55.710 --> 41:58.320
And someday I'm gonna have a family again.

42:04.790 --> 42:08.000
Zedd, why don't you tell him?

42:08.370 --> 42:11.280
Because if richard knew, he would risk his own safety for mine.

42:11.290 --> 42:13.550
And his life is far more important.

42:14.690 --> 42:17.360
Nobody hopes more than I that we find richard's mother.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.190
And there's nothing I want more than to tell him the truth.

42:21.970 --> 42:25.010
And someday, when all this is over

42:25.500 --> 42:28.290
Then, then we will have stories to tell

42:29.260 --> 42:33.950
But until then, he cannot know that I'm his grandfather.

42:45.420 --> 42:46.120
Let him go!

42:46.250 --> 42:47.450
On the next Legend of the Seeker

42:47.460 --> 42:48.500
Why did you save my life?

42:48.630 --> 42:50.630
The fate of the world might depend on you.

42:50.630 --> 42:51.670
The fight for good

42:51.810 --> 42:52.550
We have to run.

42:52.550 --> 42:53.430
You stay right here.

42:53.550 --> 42:54.470
On your feet,now!

42:55.450 --> 42:56.600
Finds a new ally

42:56.680 --> 42:57.810
He is a trueth listener.

42:57.810 --> 42:59.140
He can persue what people're thinking.

42:59.640 --> 43:00.650
With a dangerous power

43:00.730 --> 43:02.850
You think there's anything you can hide from me?

43:03.180 --> 43:04.570
And a powerful secret

43:04.680 --> 43:06.160
Tell him what you feel about it.

43:07.150 --> 43:08.140
It will be ok.

43:09.310 --> 43:10.060
Run!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
