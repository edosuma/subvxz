00:13.448 --> 00:15.493
<i>Surgeons are</i>
<i>put through rigorous tests</i>

00:15.537 --> 00:18.061
<i>just to get in the game.</i>

00:18.105 --> 00:21.456
<i>We endure decades of</i>
<i>anxiety-provoking acronyms --</i>

00:21.499 --> 00:24.285
<i>SAT, MCAT,</i>

00:24.328 --> 00:26.765
<i>USMLE, ABSITE.</i>

00:27.766 --> 00:29.029
<i> And if we pass that gauntlet...</i>

00:30.813 --> 00:34.469
<i>...we are rewarded with the</i>
<i>need to log 850 surgeries</i>

00:34.512 --> 00:38.255
<i>and take an 8-hour</i>
<i>multiple-choice and oral exam.</i>

00:38.299 --> 00:40.910
<i>There's almost no time</i>
<i>to take in the victory...</i>

00:40.953 --> 00:42.085
<i>or even a nap.</i>

00:42.129 --> 00:44.740
Oh.
I didn't really peg you

00:44.783 --> 00:46.089
for the private jet
and limo type.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.091
Don't worry.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.571
I will never send you
a private jet <i>or</i> a limousine.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.051
Okay.
Catherine Fox sent both,

00:51.094 --> 00:52.443
but thank you
for doing this here.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.618
Well, you found me
the perfect recipient,

00:53.662 --> 00:55.098
so I should be thanking you.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.231
And I've never been in a stretch
limo, so it's a win/win.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.449
Is that it?

00:58.493 --> 00:59.885
- Hey, Dr. Miranda Bailey.
- Mm-hmm.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.714
Meet Dr. Nick Marsh.
Hi.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.325
I'm not a hugger,
- but I'm gonna hug you.
- Oh!

01:04.368 --> 01:05.630
- May I hug you?
- Yeah, of course.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.718
Oh. Thank you.

01:06.762 --> 01:07.806
We need this.
Yes.

01:07.850 --> 01:08.894
Grey-Sloan needs this.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.374
Thank you!

01:10.418 --> 01:12.115
They're ready to do
the ICU conversion.
Mm.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.769
Oh, and are the residents
prepped and ready?

01:13.812 --> 01:15.292
They are ready
but not prepped.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.034
Good. I like an element
of surprise.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.689
Why are we standing
out here?

01:20.732 --> 01:21.733
That's a live organ.

01:21.777 --> 01:22.734
- Let's move!
- Right.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.741
Ow!

01:29.785 --> 01:32.266
Mom, what --
what are you doing here?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.267
What is this?

01:33.310 --> 01:34.746
Your mail.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.400
It's been piling up.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.968
You need to come in
for the residency review today.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.927
Yeah, I got the e-mail.
I'm busy.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.147
So you're just good
that our program

01:44.191 --> 01:45.757
is being slaughtered
on social media?

01:45.801 --> 01:47.150
What are you talking
about?

01:47.194 --> 01:50.327
its residents dry.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.463
and will murder you.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.812
Ow.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.814
But you may not
have seen them,

01:58.857 --> 02:01.208
but I'm pretty sure the Medical
Accreditation Council did.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.123
Oh, my God.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.473
Levi...

02:05.516 --> 02:09.912
I know you've been hurting,
but I've worked too hard.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.740
I have worked too hard
to let them come in

02:11.783 --> 02:13.655
and just shut down
our program.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.005
So please, if you have
any fight in you,

02:16.048 --> 02:18.181
any at all, get up.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.444
And come to work
just for one day!

02:21.793 --> 02:25.710
If not for yourself,
then for me, please.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.196
No.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.980
Mom!

02:35.024 --> 02:37.374
Now, I can't tell you
what to say

02:37.418 --> 02:39.246
to the accreditation council,

02:39.289 --> 02:43.293
but they will be assessing
the attendings

02:43.337 --> 02:44.381
as well
as the residents,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.427
so if they do question you,

02:46.470 --> 02:48.472
keep your answers
short and sweet,

02:48.516 --> 02:50.822
focused on the success
of the program.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.868
Do we know what questions
they're going to ask?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.739
It's a complaint-driven
site visit,

02:54.783 --> 02:56.872
so they'll want to check
our case logs,

02:56.915 --> 02:59.614
observe our residents,
review our curriculum...

02:59.657 --> 03:03.661
...and verify we are <i>all</i> staying
on top of our certifications.

03:03.705 --> 03:04.793
Do we know who complained?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.577
No, and we're not allowed
to ask.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.362
Well, how are
we supposed to show
our teaching skills

03:08.405 --> 03:09.885
with the residents
on grand rounds today

03:09.928 --> 03:11.800
with Grey and Marsh?

03:11.843 --> 03:14.759
Grand rounds today
is a miracle.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.674
Groundbreaking medicine,

03:16.718 --> 03:18.546
visiting surgeons,

03:18.589 --> 03:20.765
extraordinary
teaching opportunities --

03:20.809 --> 03:23.203
see, that's what makes
Grey-Sloan Grey-Sloan.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.770
And what happens if
they're not as impressed
with us as you are?

03:25.814 --> 03:27.207
Well, the program
goes onto probation

03:27.250 --> 03:28.599
and potentially
could be shut down.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.211
And that record would be
visible to the public.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.343
So we could lose our residents
<i>and</i> our patients.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.606
Yes.
No.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.262
Because we are going to
show them who we really are --

03:39.306 --> 03:42.613
one of the top five teaching
hospitals in the country

03:42.657 --> 03:44.528
with a world-renowned
surgical program.

03:44.572 --> 03:48.750
So, go fill in your departments
and your fellow attendings.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.491
Now go impress somebody!

03:56.453 --> 03:58.890
Ay-ay-ay-ay.

03:58.934 --> 04:02.677
Oh, no. You are scheduled
to be first interviewed.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.375
Uh, well,
it's not gonna work.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.898
And why not?

04:06.942 --> 04:08.596
My physician assessment
is in half an hour.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.424
You're doing that <i>today?</i>

04:10.467 --> 04:12.774
Inconvenient timing but I'm not
in control of the schedule.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.079
W--

04:16.038 --> 04:17.257
I think you're
all gonna see something

04:17.300 --> 04:19.084
you haven't seen before.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.651
Hi.
Hi.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.653
So, this is Mason Taylor.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.613
He was declared brain dead after
being struck by a drunk driver.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.092
We're just
procuring organs?

04:27.136 --> 04:28.355
How is this a grand rounds?

04:28.398 --> 04:29.269
Do you two have questions?

04:30.618 --> 04:31.923
Um...Um...

04:31.967 --> 04:34.448
Uh, oh, yeah, uh,
if he's the donor,

04:34.491 --> 04:35.884
then what's
in the cooler?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.494
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I not mention

04:37.538 --> 04:40.367
that Mr. Taylor
will also be the recipient?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.064
We're giving him a kidney.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.284
We're donating a kidney
to a brain-dead recipient?

04:44.327 --> 04:47.156
Did the kidney donor family
consent to this?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.768
The kidney donor is a pig --

04:50.812 --> 04:53.771
farm-raised,
genetically modified.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.078
We're doing
a xenotransplant.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.820
You're putting a pig kidney
into a human man?

04:58.863 --> 05:00.430
- That's right.
- A brain-dead human man?

05:00.474 --> 05:01.649
That's right.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.304
- I --
- Perez?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.218
I'm just <i>so</i> confused.

05:09.918 --> 05:13.095
Um, how do I explain to the team
reviewing our residency

05:13.138 --> 05:14.662
that you are unavailable?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.098
Just tell them the truth.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.492
Look, I am the director
of the residency program.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.755
I requested this assessment
myself.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.365
That speaks highly
of the standards

05:22.409 --> 05:24.149
to which
we hold ourselves,

05:24.193 --> 05:26.195
and the residency council
will appreciate that.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.631
Will they?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.024
I hope so.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.940
You can hope, or you can
postpone the assessment!

05:31.983 --> 05:33.681
Look, I see your worry --
okay? --

05:33.724 --> 05:35.160
and I understand it.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.249
But we have flown
a world-class surgeon

05:37.293 --> 05:40.644
and a neuroscientist here
according to their scheduling.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.081
I went out of my way to find
someone who doesn't like me

05:43.125 --> 05:45.170
and won't be biased,
which wasn't easy to do

05:45.214 --> 05:46.868
because
I'm pretty popular.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.261
Okay, let's just take
a deep breath, Bailey, okay?

05:49.305 --> 05:51.263
You are
my residency director.Ah.

05:51.307 --> 05:54.441
Our program is being assessed
as to whether or not

05:54.484 --> 05:56.443
it should be allowed
to continue.

05:56.486 --> 05:57.618
Now,
what if you don't pass?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.533
Richard Webber.

05:59.576 --> 06:02.405
Uh, uh, David, yeah.
Thank you for coming.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.928
Wait,
he's your evaluator?

06:03.972 --> 06:06.975
I wanted someone
as unbiased as they come.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.107
Plus, I'm an expert
at judging people.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.761
I can spot a tremor
from a mile away.

06:10.805 --> 06:11.893
He doesn't have
any tremors.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.024
Well, we're also
looking for

06:13.068 --> 06:14.591
any intellectual tremors,
if you will.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.680
Less obvious than the physical
but equally significant.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.029
He doesn't have
any of those either.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.380
Dr. Bartley is as good
a neuroscientist

06:20.423 --> 06:22.643
as you will find in these
contiguous United States.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.385
And together, we will be
the judge of that.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.256
Chief Bailey.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.345
Jamarah Blake,
Medical Accreditation Council.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.042
- Yes.
- Yikes.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.217
Busy day.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.305
Shall we?

06:33.349 --> 06:35.786
Shall we?
Yeah.

06:37.222 --> 06:40.356
Mnh.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.719
Hey! Richard.
I just wanted to wish you luck.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.026
And how'd you know? I said nothing.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.723
I grew up with an extremely
withholding mother.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.943
I can squeeze information
out of "good morning."

07:01.986 --> 07:03.510
Thank you, but I don't --
I don't need any luck.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.687
Just a time machine.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.168
Cool.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.432
Way to poke holes
in his trust in me.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.911
Well, he doesn't have to
trust <i>you,</i>

07:13.955 --> 07:15.217
he has to trust <i>himself.</i>

07:15.260 --> 07:16.610
And I have been helping him
do that

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
in his weakest moments
for years.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.049
- Mm-hmm.
- He has to pass this test.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.355
I-I am not saying
don't be truthful.

07:23.399 --> 07:28.012
I'm just saying he's important
to this hospital and to me.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.408
How long have you...

07:32.452 --> 07:36.760
I'll show you the skills labs,
simulators, residents' lounge,

07:36.804 --> 07:38.283
as well as our lecture hall

07:38.327 --> 07:40.503
where we hold our didactics
and grand rounds.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.678
But when
do you have us scheduled

07:41.722 --> 07:43.811
to speak with
the residents directly?

07:43.854 --> 07:45.682
I was hoping to start with
Dr. Schmitt.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.816
They are, uh,
actually observing

07:48.859 --> 07:51.035
a groundbreaking
medical innovation today.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.604
Okay, everyone say,
"Thank you, Mason."

07:56.258 --> 07:58.956
Mason here wanted to
donate his organs,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.742
but UNOS ruled it out due to
his history of cancer.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.700
So instead, his wife consented
to donating

08:03.744 --> 08:05.833
his whole body to research.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.052
Listen, 17 people die
each and every day

08:08.096 --> 08:09.532
waiting for
a kidney transplant.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.578
If this works,
we could say goodbye

08:11.621 --> 08:15.059
to long transplant lists
in just a few years.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.408
So...

08:16.452 --> 08:18.498
- Thank you, Mason.
- Good.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.195
Alright.
Now, what does this one do?

08:20.238 --> 08:21.979
Oh, whoa, okay.
Wha-- Oh, I got it. Okay.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.379
Is this the first time
anyone's done this?

08:30.422 --> 08:32.599
Yep. Who can tell me why
we're working on a dead man?

08:32.642 --> 08:33.774
First, do no harm.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.427
Exactly.
We can't experiment

08:35.471 --> 08:38.213
with a xenotransplant on anyone
who has anything to lose.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.215
And why are we attaching
the kidney to the groin?

08:40.258 --> 08:41.346
So that you can see
the kidney

08:41.390 --> 08:42.913
while you're assessing
its performance.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.568
We'll actually see the kidney
darken if rejection happens.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.962
Also, the groin is
close to the bladder,

08:48.005 --> 08:50.573
which provides a good blood
supply through the iliac artery.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.270
- Wow. Correct.
- Mm.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.708
I don't care what
Dr. Grey says about you --

08:54.751 --> 08:56.579
you guys are
a pretty sharp group.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.191
You have one minute to make
that side look like that side.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.410
Well, I'm not a toddler.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.629
Again, we'll be the judge
of that.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.805
And go.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.680
It's impressive that

09:10.724 --> 09:12.247
you're still bringing in
innovative cases

09:12.290 --> 09:14.641
when you've lost --
let me see -- um...

09:14.684 --> 09:16.381
seven physicians
recently?

09:16.425 --> 09:17.861
Well, we've had a lot
of retirees this year.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.167
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.604
So did Dr. Hayes,
chief of peds, retire?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.214
Actually, he moved
back to Ireland.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.347
I was told
it was a family matter.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.522
Yeah.
Huh.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.784
We have urine.
He peed!

09:28.829 --> 09:30.570
We got urine!

09:30.613 --> 09:32.354
Oh, my God!

09:32.397 --> 09:34.138
Okay, I'm gonna
give them this.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.270
Dr. Bailey,
we have urine.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.793
Yeah! So we heard!

09:36.837 --> 09:38.273
Uh, D-Dr. Grey,

09:38.316 --> 09:40.797
this is the team from
the accreditation council.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.583
It's nice to meet you.
Uh, it's a big deal.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.933
So, obviously the residents
are very excited.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.588
Th-The residents
are always enthusiastic

09:48.631 --> 09:49.850
when they work with
Dr. Grey.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.503
Well, I would imagine so.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.376
And it seems like a rare
opportunity these days.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.160
You're a busy woman,
Dr. Grey.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.814
I am.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.816
I actually have
a liver biopsy to get to.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
It's a pleasure to meet
both of you.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.428
- I'll see you soon.
- Nice to meet you.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.388
- Mm. So, Dr. Bailey?
- Yeah.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.824
Who's next?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.826
Yes.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.743
What about this one?

10:13.787 --> 10:17.660
patients suffer."

10:17.704 --> 10:19.270
When was the last time
you knew me

10:19.314 --> 10:20.837
to do anything right
on a computer?

10:20.881 --> 10:23.579
Mom, you can't just criticize
my workplace --

10:23.623 --> 10:26.016
and with so many
unnecessary hashtags!

10:26.060 --> 10:27.539
So now it's
your workplace again?

10:27.583 --> 10:28.845
Oh, Mom!

10:28.889 --> 10:31.631
I do not need you
to fight my battles.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.937
Sweetheart, you walked out
of your job,

10:33.981 --> 10:35.417
you broke up
with your boyfriend,

10:35.460 --> 10:37.375
you sit down here all day
and all night

10:37.419 --> 10:38.420
playing video games.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.248
You don't go outside.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.641
You need help, Levi.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.164
And how does it help me

10:43.207 --> 10:45.166
for you to trash-talk
my training program?

10:45.209 --> 10:47.472
You never should have been in
that operating room by yourself.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.083
They never should have
put you in a situation

10:49.126 --> 10:51.259
where you could
single-handedly kill a man.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.870
Every surgeon eventually
loses someone on the table.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.133
Keyword being "eventually."

10:56.177 --> 10:57.526
Not before you're prepared.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.962
You're never prepared!

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
Not before you're trained!

11:00.616 --> 11:02.183
They experimented on you!

11:02.226 --> 11:05.273
That is how medicine
evolves, Mom.

11:05.316 --> 11:08.363
That is how
teaching techniques evolve.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.669
They experiment.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.322
I am the one who failed
the Webber method,

11:11.366 --> 11:12.541
not the other way around!

11:12.584 --> 11:15.065
- You are still a student.
- Oh, Mom.

11:15.109 --> 11:18.765
You were holding a scalpel
- without a teacher in the room!
- I --

11:18.808 --> 11:22.464
And you don't have to think
that that's wrong, but <i>I</i> do!

11:22.507 --> 11:25.032
I do, and I have the right
to warn others!

11:25.075 --> 11:25.859
Oh, God.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.643
Mom!

11:27.687 --> 11:28.731
Oh, my God.
Mom.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.559
Oh, my God, Mom.

11:30.602 --> 11:31.691
Mom. Hey.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.090
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.049
Okay.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.531
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

11:46.575 --> 11:49.796
Hi, yes. My mom -- she f-fell
down a-a flight of stairs,

11:49.839 --> 11:52.015
and she's unconscious,
unresponsive,

11:52.059 --> 11:54.714
and her respiratory rate's
around 24.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.151
<i>What's the address?</i> 357 Northside Drive.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.762
She, uh, also has shortening

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
and internal rotation
of the left leg,

12:02.025 --> 12:03.810
which means a possible
femoral neck fracture.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.551
Just hurry up, please!

12:06.595 --> 12:08.423
Mom?
I'm so sorry, Mom.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.120
It's gonna be okay, okay?

12:10.164 --> 12:11.905
I'm sorry.
Just stay with me.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.907
Purple.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.517
Green.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.127
Uh, yellow.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.346
Orange.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.348
Uh, bl-- red --
I mean, blue!

12:20.391 --> 12:21.349
Uh, uh, I missed one.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.742
Uh, may I try it again?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.874
On a good day,
I miss three.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.007
Our brains don't like
incongruent information.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.922
That's why this test
is a good indicator

12:28.965 --> 12:31.794
of attention capacity
and processing speed.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.665
And you actually did
quite well.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.755
We have decades of muscle memory
in our brains,

12:35.798 --> 12:38.322
and this damn Stroop test
is asking us to ignore it.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.933
Of course, as surgeons,

12:39.976 --> 12:42.022
we have to process
a lot of information

12:42.065 --> 12:44.198
in a short amount of time
as we operate.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.329
I know this.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.940
And I know that
there's a difference

12:46.983 --> 12:50.421
between slowing down a bit
and being a danger in the OR.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.075
I appreciate that.

12:52.119 --> 12:55.339
Aging as a surgeon is
a special kind of humiliation.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.559
We watch doctors
with half our experience

12:57.602 --> 12:58.995
whipping through procedures

12:59.039 --> 13:01.432
with their agile hands
and their nimble brains.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.740
Then part of our job is to find
and recruit the next you,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.829
which can be
a fun challenge,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.439
but can also be
a real ego-buster

13:08.483 --> 13:09.832
while you're waiting
for them to determine

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
your footsteps
are worth following.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.793
Sounds as if you're speaking
from experience.

13:15.272 --> 13:18.841
Well, uh,
I -- I -- I --

13:18.885 --> 13:20.495
I imagine
it would be hard.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.587
I knew it.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.025
I knew it!

13:29.069 --> 13:31.723
I said it from the first time
you brought her to Minnesota!

13:31.767 --> 13:34.335
You're trying to poach
Meredith Grey!

13:34.378 --> 13:37.381
A+ on the reasoning skills
section.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.953
Yes, I did my residency
at Tufts,

13:43.997 --> 13:45.172
where I became
an attending.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.434
Well, Tufts is one
of the nation's

13:46.477 --> 13:48.436
most renowned institutions.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.003
What brought you back
to Grey-Sloan?

13:50.046 --> 13:51.961
Also a renowned
institution.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.834
Well, yes, that,
and my former teacher

13:54.877 --> 13:57.271
is one of
- the chiefs of cardio here.
- Mm.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.403
And I've always wanted
to work with her again.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.578
There's no one like her.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.319
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.843
Also your wife.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.279
Do you make a habit
of dating your students,

14:05.322 --> 14:07.281
or was your husband
the first?

14:07.324 --> 14:08.499
Excuse me?

14:08.543 --> 14:10.588
Was your relationship
on record at Tufts?

14:10.632 --> 14:13.722
No, we didn't ha--
Wait.

14:13.765 --> 14:14.941
I'm sorry.
I don't see how this

14:14.984 --> 14:17.117
is relevant
to our residency program.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.858
There have been some
reports that there is a history

14:18.901 --> 14:20.729
of inappropriate sexual conduct
here at Grey-Sloan,

14:20.772 --> 14:22.383
so we have to be thorough.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.819
Well, I can assure you
that our relationship

14:23.863 --> 14:25.516
is in no way
inappropriate.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.257
Are we done here?

14:27.301 --> 14:29.694
Did you know Dr. Pierce
was a child prodigy?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.744
Dr. Hunt, your mobility
looks good.

14:35.787 --> 14:36.963
I heard about
your accident.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.052
Now, we have an excellent
PT department.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.923
Oh, so, when do you think
you'll be able to operate again?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.707
Soon.
Soon. Uh.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.753
- A few more sessions of PT.Okay, great.
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.495
Uh, Dr. Hunt's experience
as a military surgeon

14:47.538 --> 14:51.194
has been a huge asset
to our level 1 trauma center.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.936
And, uh, he's been
overseeing a study --

14:53.980 --> 14:56.330
In burn pit illnesses
in military veterans.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.071
Yes, I've read about that.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.160
Now, a few of the patients
involved with the study

15:00.203 --> 15:01.944
died recently.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.990
You're still able
to move forward?

15:04.033 --> 15:05.426
There were -- There were --
There were -- There -- There --

15:05.469 --> 15:06.949
There were some deaths.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.168
There -- There were
several deaths,

15:08.211 --> 15:11.040
but that's because
burn pits kill people.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.346
I-I-I-I thought
we were here

15:12.389 --> 15:14.043
to talk about
the residency program.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.570
It's a great program.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.311
I left a job
with the Seattle Mariners

15:21.355 --> 15:23.052
to work at Grey-Sloan.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.967
That was a big change.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.969
Turned my life upside down,
you know?

15:27.013 --> 15:30.059
I used to live life on the road,
free and easy.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.757
Now I have a baby and, uh,

15:32.801 --> 15:34.759
a completely shattered heart,

15:34.803 --> 15:38.024
and an apartment
with no furniture.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.982
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

15:45.205 --> 15:48.556
Okay, get the biopsy, call me
when the results come in.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.384
I want to see those cells
myself.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.429
<i>Satellite pharmacy 2622.</i>

15:52.473 --> 15:54.518
<i>Satellite pharmacy 2622.</i>

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
Excuse me, are --
a-are you Dr. Marsh?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.220
Yes.
Yeah, we spoke
on the phone.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.656
I'm Jan Taylor.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.353
I-I-I came straight
from the airport.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.790
My husband, Mason...
Yes.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.444
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.664
I need to see him.
Is he still --

16:09.707 --> 16:11.318
- can I see him?
- Unfortunately, no.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.320
I'm sorry.
We can't risk exposure.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.321
No.
I-I don't accept that.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.192
He's my husband.
Whoa.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.454
No, no, no.
- I need to see my husband!
- It's okay, it's okay.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.674
It's okay, it's okay.
Jan, listen.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.893
You can see him.
You can absolutely see him.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.287
Um, you can say goodbye.
Just not right now.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.028
No, no, please.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.074
Please let -- let me see him.
Let -- L-Let me see him.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.249
Jan...He's my husband.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.554
Listen to me.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.035
Listen, l-listen, listen.
Listen to me, okay?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.907
Remember
what we're doing here, okay,

16:35.951 --> 16:37.257
what you consented to.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.650
If this works, it could save
thousands of lives --

16:39.694 --> 16:41.348
thousands.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.045
And I know
you've lost everything.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.873
And I can't imagine what
you're feeling right now,

16:44.916 --> 16:46.309
but if you go barging
into the room, it is done.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.442
- It is over.
- He beat cancer!

16:48.485 --> 16:49.747
He beat cancer.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.662
And he gets himself killed
crossing the street!

16:51.706 --> 16:53.229
I understand.
Oh, my God.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.318
Oh, my God.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.842
Oh, my God.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.545
- Oh, my God!
- Mm.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.157
I know.
And I'm sorry.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.551
Oh, my God.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.430
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.780
Okay, okay.
ABCs.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.608
"A" -- airway --

17:24.652 --> 17:26.045
not obstructed,

17:26.088 --> 17:29.787
but definitely having trouble
with "B" -- breathing.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.837
Increased resonance
on the right side.

17:37.752 --> 17:41.103
Jugular venous distention.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.322
Oh, my God.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.411
Her trachea's deviated.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.500
Mommy, you have
a tension pneumothorax.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.588
I need help!

17:47.631 --> 17:49.329
Where's the ambulance?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.592
Where are they?

17:51.635 --> 17:53.507
Oh, God. Okay.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.812
Okay.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.684
Hey, Mom, it's okay.
They're on their way.

17:56.727 --> 17:57.946
I'm right here, okay?

18:00.949 --> 18:03.299
Okay. Exactly what is the point
of this one?

18:03.343 --> 18:05.910
This tests your ability
to ignore distraction

18:05.954 --> 18:07.956
while maintaining
neuromuscular control.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.001
Just remember you're controlling
the cursor with your movement.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.481
Look, I'm trying!

18:11.525 --> 18:13.440
But you just told me you were
stealing my top surgeon.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.006
No stealing about it.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.704
The offer nearly broke
the clinic's budget.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.097
And you had the nerve
to mention it

18:18.140 --> 18:20.055
while I'm in the middle
of my assessment.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.666
I <i>didn't</i> mention it,
you inferred.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.668
Our residency program
is being evaluated

18:24.712 --> 18:26.496
on its teaching ability.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.934
If they find out that our top
teacher's considering leaving...

18:31.501 --> 18:33.416
Oh, you know what?
Uh...

18:33.460 --> 18:35.810
Uh, you know what?
Respectfully,

18:35.853 --> 18:37.507
you're gonna have to start this
over again, all right?

18:37.551 --> 18:38.682
A-Are you mad
that I told you,

18:38.726 --> 18:40.380
or are you mad
that she may accept?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.556
It's an incredible opportunity
for her, Richard,

18:42.599 --> 18:44.906
and she's a Grey!

18:44.949 --> 18:47.256
She is bigger
than just one hospital.

18:51.826 --> 18:52.870
Schmitt,
I'm in the middle --

18:52.914 --> 18:54.045
<i>Dr. Webber, it's my mom.</i>

18:54.089 --> 18:55.308
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>Mom, stay with me.</i>

18:55.351 --> 18:57.223
<i>She fell down the stairs.</i>

18:57.266 --> 18:59.529
<i>The ambulance is taking</i>
<i>forever to get here.</i>

19:05.709 --> 19:08.582
<i>Schmitt, talk to me.</i>
<i>Did you find --</i> I found a knife!

19:08.625 --> 19:09.974
Can you sterilize it
with something?

19:10.018 --> 19:11.193
<i>Um...yes.</i>
<i>I have alcohol wipes.</i>

19:11.237 --> 19:12.890
Okay.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.114
Schmitt?

19:20.855 --> 19:22.813
Uh, Dr. Webber, I don't --
I don't think I --

19:22.857 --> 19:24.989
that I can s-stab my mom
with a knife.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.253
<i>It is not a knife.</i>
<i>It is a makeshift scalpel.</i>

19:27.296 --> 19:28.689
<i>And you</i>
<i>are not stabbing her.</i>

19:28.732 --> 19:30.908
She is a patient who needs
a thoracostomy.

19:30.952 --> 19:31.866
I've seen you do
dozens of them.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.433
Okay. Okay.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.217
Um.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.045
Okay.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.742
Okay.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.135
I'm sorry, Mom.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.180
Um.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.400
All right.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.273
Um, all I have are --
are some little scissors

19:47.316 --> 19:48.361
to get into the chest wall.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.318
Okay. That'll do.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.280
All right,
I'm in -- I'm in.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.717
Okay.
She's breathing better now.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.761
<i>Nice job, Schmitt.</i>

19:57.805 --> 19:59.110
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.547
What is it?

20:00.590 --> 20:03.376
Uh, it's a hemopneumothorax,
not just a tension pneumo!

20:03.419 --> 20:04.855
<i>Schmitt, I need you</i>
<i>to stay calm.</i>
Okay.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.684
<i>Seattle Fire Department!</i> Oh, thank God.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.425
I'm down here!

20:12.341 --> 20:14.169
- Ah, Dr. Wilson.
- Yeah.

20:14.213 --> 20:18.347
Hey, these are members of the
Medical Accreditation Council.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.610
- See here.
- Oh. Uh, well...

20:20.654 --> 20:23.700
There is, um, no better
residency program

20:23.744 --> 20:25.963
and no better chief
than Dr. Bailey.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.836
Then why did you leave?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.925
My husband left me, and then
I had a nervous breakdown --

20:30.968 --> 20:32.753
not in that order --
and then there was a pandemic.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.277
So I just needed a change.

20:35.321 --> 20:38.062
Okay. Did Dr. Bailey try to
dissuade you from this decision?

20:40.543 --> 20:42.197
Um...

20:42.241 --> 20:44.286
- she absolutely did.
- Oh.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.723
You did five years
of surgical residency,

20:46.767 --> 20:49.291
a fellowship
with Dr. Bailey,

20:49.335 --> 20:52.120
uh, two years as
a general surgery attending?

20:52.163 --> 20:53.382
That's right.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.515
And just threw it all away
to start over again?

20:57.212 --> 20:59.562
I use my surgical training
in my current residency

20:59.606 --> 21:00.868
all the time.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.913
It's where I learned
to think on my feet,

21:02.957 --> 21:04.698
make tough choices
under pressure,

21:04.741 --> 21:06.569
pivot when
circumstances change.

21:06.613 --> 21:10.181
And respectfully, there is
an arrogance and superiority

21:10.225 --> 21:12.706
that surgeons have
when discussing obstetrics.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.534
I feel it reflected
in this line of questioning,

21:14.577 --> 21:15.578
and I resent it.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.624
But in summation,

21:17.667 --> 21:19.582
there is no better
residency program,

21:19.626 --> 21:22.672
and there is no better chief
than Dr. Bailey.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.588
Excuse me.
I have a mom at 7 centimeters.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.070
Okay.

21:29.113 --> 21:32.247
Uh, next on my list
is Dr. Richard Webber.

21:33.161 --> 21:36.077
Yes, um...

21:36.120 --> 21:38.775
Why don't, uh, uh,
you two take your break?

21:38.819 --> 21:41.430
And I will go get him.
Mm.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.694
Did they start a line?

21:44.738 --> 21:45.956
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God. Mom?</i>

21:46.000 --> 21:47.175
They put her on O2?

21:47.218 --> 21:48.655
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:48.698 --> 21:49.873
Did they bandage
the wound?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.701
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>ETA's about 10 minutes.</i>

21:51.745 --> 21:53.268
<i>Could you call</i>
<i>cardio and ortho?</i>

21:53.312 --> 21:55.096
<i>Have a chest-tube tray set up</i>
<i>and portable X-ray.</i>

21:55.139 --> 21:56.097
Yeah, I got it, Schmitt.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.228
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

21:57.272 --> 21:59.927
Hey, ugh,
it is not going well.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.624
<i>Please</i> tell me you passed
because --

22:01.668 --> 22:03.844
Levi Schmitt's mom took
a bad fall down the stairs.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.281
Hemopneumothorax,
possible hip fracture.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.588
He's on his way
with her here now.

22:08.631 --> 22:11.330
Why do I get the sense you're
not telling me the <i>whole</i> story?

22:12.940 --> 22:14.898
Has Meredith
spoken to you yet?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.910
Hey.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.391
Blood pressure -- fwwt! --
plummeting.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.567
Oh.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.048
The blood flow's not strong
enough to perfuse the kidney,

22:34.091 --> 22:35.658
so he's not making urine
anymore.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.488
I sent the residents
out for labs and coffee,

22:39.532 --> 22:42.273
but, really, I sent them away
so I wouldn't scream at anyone.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.492
Did you try a bolus?

22:43.536 --> 22:45.146
Multiple.
Plus atropine.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.713
I maxed out on dopamine.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.020
Epi?

22:50.064 --> 22:52.066
Maybe.
I don't know.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.067
I don't know.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.808
I just --
I need this to work.

22:56.549 --> 22:59.073
His wife's waiting to see him,
and among other things,

22:59.116 --> 23:00.944
it'd be really nice
to give her some good news.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.781
The worst part about this job
is telling families

23:11.825 --> 23:14.218
that their person
didn't make it.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.351
And you have that,
on some level,

23:16.395 --> 23:18.484
in every single case.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.573
Yeah.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.359
Unless this works.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.188
If this works,
maybe in a few years...

23:27.231 --> 23:29.320
I don't know.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.193
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.502
I think it's why
you shake in your sleep.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.679
I do?

23:39.722 --> 23:41.724
Just a little bit.

23:41.768 --> 23:45.119
I put my hand on you,
and it stops.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.991
No one's ever told me that
before.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.344
Hey.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.999
You let me hug you.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.045
You're taking that job
in Minnesota.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.829
Couldn't even tell me
yourself?

23:59.873 --> 24:01.483
Couldn't give me
that much respect?

24:02.832 --> 24:04.486
No, I haven't even
made a decision yet.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.880
This program raised you!

24:06.923 --> 24:09.491
<i>I</i> raised you, taught you
all that you know.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.885
T-Then made all the concessions
that you needed

24:11.928 --> 24:13.582
so you could split your time
between here and --

24:13.626 --> 24:15.323
and -- and David Hamilton.

24:15.366 --> 24:19.414
And -- And then, even with all
of that, you'd be so <i>selfish</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:22.678
as to leave in the middle of
a historic physician shortage

24:22.722 --> 24:25.072
with the residency program
hanging on --

24:25.115 --> 24:26.856
-- by a thread?!

24:26.900 --> 24:29.511
Bailey.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.688
Y-You're j-- Yeah, no,
you're that girl, huh?

24:33.950 --> 24:36.997
That same
little girl

24:37.040 --> 24:40.479
that's following
her handsome attending

24:40.522 --> 24:42.176
all around the hospital,
right?

24:42.219 --> 24:44.787
Breaking all the rules.
Having sex in cars.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.615
No one and nobody else
matters.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.835
It doesn't matter
that he's your boss,

24:48.878 --> 24:50.663
not that
he's already married!

24:50.706 --> 24:52.839
No, enough!
- Enough now!
- And d--

24:52.882 --> 24:55.015
Yeah, okay, okay. Let's just
take a minute here, okay?

24:55.058 --> 24:56.451
Stop! I already know
where you stand.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.801
No, <i>you</i> stop!

24:58.845 --> 25:00.586
Don't you speak to him
that way!

25:02.239 --> 25:04.633
Why are you speaking to <i>me</i>
this way?!

25:06.330 --> 25:08.115
He's here
doing us a favor!

25:10.509 --> 25:11.727
Bailey!

25:11.771 --> 25:12.685
Whoa.
I got her, I got her.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.687
- Okay. Sit down. Uh-huh.
- Yep.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.166
- Let's page cardio.
- Okay.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.519
Bailey?
Huh?

25:29.440 --> 25:30.964
I need Bailey to be okay.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.924
She got in your head.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.579
She's been in my head
since I was an intern.
Mm-hmm.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.712
Never seen her go off on me
like this before.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.279
Not on anyone.
Mm-hmm.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.325
Now she's got you
re-thinking Minnesota.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.719
Yeah, well, she had a heart
attack when she heard about it.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.721
That looked more like panic
to me.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.419
I hope you're right,
because I need her to be okay.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.595
Because I -- I --
I do love her.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.989
I do not like her very much
right now,

25:56.032 --> 25:58.078
but I do love her.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.253
I know.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.476
So, your -- your --
your husband was married

26:05.520 --> 26:06.913
when you first met him?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.654
Don't really remember
that part of the story.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.917
It was a lot more complicated
than that.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.049
But she just told the truth
about how she sees me.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.399
She put a finger on
what I couldn't.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.402
You can't stay at the place
you did your residency forever

26:18.446 --> 26:20.622
because that's how people
see you --

26:20.666 --> 26:22.581
they see you
for who you were,

26:22.624 --> 26:24.757
not as the person
you've become.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.280
- Dr. Marsh.
- Yeah.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.108
Mason's catheter --
it's full.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.636
- EKG looks good.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.769
No ST or T-wave changes.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.858
Your rapid troponin
is negative,

26:38.901 --> 26:40.599
so this was not
a cardiac event,

26:40.642 --> 26:43.732
but, Bailey, you are <i>obviously</i>
very stressed out.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.560
You need to slow down.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.388
I'll slow down tomorrow.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.999
Today, I have
a residency program to save.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.740
Why is this all
falling on you?

26:51.784 --> 26:52.785
Where is Richard?

26:52.828 --> 26:54.830
Having an unnecessary
assessment!

26:54.874 --> 26:56.658
What?
Oh.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.920
This is how
today's gonna go?

26:57.964 --> 27:00.009
People accidentally
telling people things

27:00.053 --> 27:01.141
that they should have
already known?

27:01.184 --> 27:02.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
But, Bailey, Bailey!

27:02.533 --> 27:04.057
What?
Calm down!

27:04.100 --> 27:06.102
Come on.
Deep breaths.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.976
Ah.

27:12.195 --> 27:15.372
You are marching steadily
toward another M.I.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.158
You need to do --

27:18.201 --> 27:20.813
Do less. I know.
Mm-hmm.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.163
But that's not an option.

27:23.206 --> 27:26.296
This program
is falling apart on my watch.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.865
I know. I'm --
I'm stretched too thin,

27:29.909 --> 27:32.085
and then we took thin
even thinner

27:32.128 --> 27:34.565
with the addition of
a toddler to our family.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.657
And then I heard
Meredith might be leaving,

27:38.700 --> 27:40.267
and I lost it on her,

27:40.310 --> 27:42.704
which may or may not
have been fair to --

27:42.748 --> 27:45.228
Wait, wait, wait.
Meredith what?

27:45.272 --> 27:47.274
Oh, you've got to
be kidding.

27:48.754 --> 27:52.453
Hey.
How's it going?

27:52.496 --> 27:53.976
I can't tell you
how he's doing on the test.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.935
Mm.

27:55.978 --> 27:59.460
But do you think...
he maybe has dementia?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.331
Or a drinking problem?

28:01.375 --> 28:03.856
No.
Very much no.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.161
Why?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.728
Because he walked out
of his assessment.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.122
He took a phone call,
and he left

28:09.165 --> 28:10.645
without a word
of explanation,

28:10.689 --> 28:12.603
which was disrespectful,
at best.

28:12.647 --> 28:13.561
It also showed
a lack of judgment,

28:13.604 --> 28:15.389
which is not a great sign.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.521
Yeah, I've done a lot of things
that lacked judgment.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.524
Hi.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.832
Seriously?

28:23.876 --> 28:25.965
What, I'm not allowed to laugh
at funny things anymore?

28:26.008 --> 28:27.009
What did I say
that was so funny?

28:27.053 --> 28:28.750
Hi.
I'm Kai Bartley.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.621
You must be
Scout's dad.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.711
Link.
Atticus Lincoln.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.931
Wait.
You've met Scout?

28:35.975 --> 28:37.324
Your name is Atticus?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.368
- Don't.
- Excuse me.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.630
Don't protect me.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.110
No, I'm not
protecting you.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.373
I'm protecting myself
from having to watch

28:43.417 --> 28:44.635
another one
of your hissy fits.

28:44.679 --> 28:45.985
- <i> My</i> hissy fits?
- Mm-hmm.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.334
Dr. Webber,
why are you --

28:47.377 --> 28:49.771
Uh.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.778
Schmitt?
57 years old,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.867
status post-fall
down a flight of stairs,

28:58.911 --> 29:01.130
sustaining
a tension hemopneumothorax

29:01.174 --> 29:03.437
with a flail chest and likely
a femoral neck fracture.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.744
Pneumo relieved by
a home thoracostomy but --

29:05.787 --> 29:07.702
Okay, trauma one's ready.
Move, move, move.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.791
We were just i-in a fight,
and then she slipped,

29:09.835 --> 29:11.010
and she fell down the stairs,

29:11.053 --> 29:12.402
and I-I feel like
it's all my fault.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.795
What -- No. Schmitt, no.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.275
You saved her life.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.973
Now let Altman and Link
finish what you started.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.366
Dr. Webber, I want to
go with my mom.

29:19.409 --> 29:22.456
You absolutely cannot go.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.198
Richard, you need to finish
what you started.

29:25.241 --> 29:28.288
Dr. Webber, I can't just wait
and do nothing.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.985
Uh, can I finish?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.117
I'd recommend it.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.683
Okay.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.078
My mom wrote
those things.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.254
She wrote that
this program breaks people

29:38.298 --> 29:39.778
because I was broken,

29:39.821 --> 29:43.259
and then we got into a fight,
and s-she fell,

29:43.303 --> 29:45.784
and -- and now she might die
just like Devon did,

29:45.827 --> 29:48.308
and all of it's my fault.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.050
All of it. It's all my fault.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.748
It's all my fault.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.446
It's all --
It's all my fault!

29:56.490 --> 29:59.580
It's all -- It's -- It's --
It's all my fault.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.671
It's all my fault!

30:06.543 --> 30:09.242
It's all my fault!

30:37.052 --> 30:39.228
You said five rules.
That was only four.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.301
Richard Webber,
general surgeon,

31:08.344 --> 31:10.259
Fox Foundation
chief medical officer,

31:10.303 --> 31:13.480
and residency director
at Grey-Sloan.

31:19.138 --> 31:22.184
Levi Schmitt,
fourth-year, um, resident.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.491
Grey-Sloan has been
a training ground

31:24.534 --> 31:27.755
for <i>hundreds</i>
of successful surgeons.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.980
I started as a sub-I
under Dr. Webber.

31:37.504 --> 31:40.681
My f-first day wasn't, uh,

31:40.724 --> 31:43.075
exactly stellar.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.903
Meredith Grey.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.905
Miranda Bailey.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.951
Hell,
I trained here myself.

31:49.995 --> 31:54.477
When I was a resident,
I thought saving a life

31:54.521 --> 31:57.263
was the highest calling
to aspire to.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.092
Then I started teaching.

32:06.272 --> 32:09.318
My -- My glasses fell
into a patient.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.018
But I learned,
and I got better.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.845
Because Dr. Webber
didn't give up on me.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.501
There's something
uniquely fulfilling

32:18.545 --> 32:22.027
about training future
generations of surgeons.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.290
He taught me how to do
lap choles

32:24.333 --> 32:28.076
and the importance
of a square knot.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.774
You see them
show up wide-eyed.

32:30.818 --> 32:32.951
You nurture
and nudge them.

32:32.994 --> 32:35.997
You watch them achieve
and stumble

32:36.041 --> 32:39.609
and grow and soar.

32:39.653 --> 32:43.265
He also taught me
how to persevere

32:43.309 --> 32:45.180
and learn
from my mistakes.

32:45.224 --> 32:48.009
I know that this review is
supposed to determine whether

32:48.053 --> 32:50.794
he's a competent surgeon
or effective teacher.

32:50.838 --> 32:54.015
I'm sure the methodology
behind it is well-tested.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.626
I asked for an evaluation
to see if it was time

32:56.670 --> 32:59.455
for me
to put down my scalpel.

32:59.499 --> 33:04.025
Years ago, I took an oath --
do no harm.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.766
I stand by it.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.465
I don't want to retire.

33:09.509 --> 33:13.121
I love being a surgeon.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.297
And I love teaching.

33:15.341 --> 33:16.995
You all know what you're doing.
Just don't kill anyone.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.953
I'm done!

33:18.997 --> 33:20.868
But I also know
that Richard Webber

33:20.911 --> 33:22.609
helped me save
my mom's life today.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.137
Or I -- I hope so.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.663
I hope that
we saved her life.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.275
But even more,
I believe in the power

33:36.318 --> 33:39.887
of medicine and science.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.237
I don't even want to
think about

33:42.281 --> 33:45.240
what could've happened
without him.

33:45.284 --> 33:49.636
So if I need to step down
in order for future generations

33:49.679 --> 33:51.290
to keep training here...

33:55.946 --> 33:57.339
...then I will.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.347
I appreciate you
letting me finish.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.305
And for taking the statement
from Schmitt.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.698
Oh, it certainly
can't hurt.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.569
It's also not necessary.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.181
You passed.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.443
Flying colors.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.445
Congrats, Webber.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.012
Mrs. Schmitt's head CT
was negative.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.362
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- Teddy and Link
are almost done.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.015
She's gonna make it.

35:05.059 --> 35:05.886
Wow.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.629
Thank you.
I --

35:11.848 --> 35:13.198
Well, thank you.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.113
Well, don't thank me.
You're the one who passed.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.636
- He passed?
- Mm-hmm.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.377
You passed!

35:18.420 --> 35:20.596
Oh.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.381
- Oh!

35:24.861 --> 35:27.168
Not everyone gets another chance
in the OR.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.781
Take advantage.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.877
I'm sorry about earlier.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.096
I was worried about him.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.881
That's okay.
I get it.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.187
He's your David.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.103
Mm.

35:59.983 --> 36:03.639
Hi. Uh, so, I can
show you more things.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.685
Um, our plant room,
which --

36:05.728 --> 36:08.253
Actually, Dr. Bailey,
we've seen enough.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.864
Okay.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.126
Please.

36:14.259 --> 36:17.523
We have reviewed hundreds
of these residency programs,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.612
and we can usually tell
pretty quickly

36:19.655 --> 36:21.396
when they're not working,

36:21.440 --> 36:24.704
and that's even when the doctors
and the residents

36:24.747 --> 36:27.097
are very well-prepped
for my visit.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.490
I see.

36:28.534 --> 36:31.972
And based on my visit today,
I can unequivocally say

36:32.015 --> 36:34.192
that when it comes to
resident well-being,

36:34.235 --> 36:37.717
that Grey-Sloan's
surgical department is...

36:37.760 --> 36:40.894
well, one of the best
that I've seen.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.592
Despite long hours
and hard work,

36:43.636 --> 36:47.683
the residents seem genuinely
excited about their work.

36:47.727 --> 36:51.078
And your attendings --
they care enough to be nervous

36:51.121 --> 36:55.082
about these meetings,
which is a good sign.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.651
The sense of community,
the sense of family

36:58.694 --> 37:01.784
is completely palpable.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.699
And Dr. Webber?

37:03.743 --> 37:07.573
Well...
he's impressive.

37:07.616 --> 37:10.271
- He is.
- Mm.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.621
What I saw
in person today

37:12.665 --> 37:16.364
was almost enough to override
what I see on paper.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.844
But not quite.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.411
As caring
as you of all are,

37:19.454 --> 37:21.587
you simply do not have
enough surgeons

37:21.630 --> 37:24.894
to maintain
an effective teaching program.

37:24.938 --> 37:28.768
D-Dr. Bailey, it, um...

37:28.811 --> 37:31.988
it hurts me to say this,
but I am going to have to

37:32.032 --> 37:35.296
place Grey-Sloan's
residency program on probation,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.342
effective immediately.

37:37.385 --> 37:40.867
We will provide a list
of specific improvements

37:40.910 --> 37:42.564
that need to be made,
and we'll be back

37:42.608 --> 37:45.393
for another review
in a few weeks.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.090
A few -- A few weeks?

37:47.134 --> 37:49.179
We always give hospitals time
to rectify matters

37:49.223 --> 37:51.660
before we shut down
their residency programs.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.316
Good luck, Dr. Bailey.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.318
<i>Researchers studied why some </i>
<i> people perform better on tests.</i>

37:57.362 --> 37:58.450
Okay.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.801
<i>They found that</i>
<i>it's not necessarily</i>

38:01.844 --> 38:04.630
<i>related to intelligence.</i>

38:04.673 --> 38:09.112
<i>Some people become anxious</i>
<i>during exams...</i>

38:09.156 --> 38:11.463
<i>and divert mental energy</i>
<i>toward anxiety</i>

38:11.506 --> 38:14.509
<i>instead of expending it</i>
<i>on finding the right answers.</i>

38:17.773 --> 38:19.862
<i>Others have a better grasp</i>
<i>of how tests work.</i>

38:22.909 --> 38:25.259
<i> They use process of elimination</i>
<i>and other techniques</i>

38:25.303 --> 38:26.869
<i>to help them make</i>
<i>better choices.</i>

38:30.699 --> 38:32.484
<i>Some people study harder.</i>

38:32.527 --> 38:34.616
<i>They start early,</i>
<i>make flashcards...</i>

38:36.575 --> 38:38.490
<i>...rely on repetition</i>
<i>to retrieve answers</i>

38:38.533 --> 38:40.361
<i>when they need them.</i>

38:46.019 --> 38:47.412
Well, you were right.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.413
Bailey's okay.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.588
Okay, good.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.460
I spoke to Maggie.

38:52.504 --> 38:55.898
She didn't know about the offer,
either, so...

38:55.942 --> 38:57.030
Can I bring her in?

38:57.073 --> 38:59.293
Yeah.
Um, one second.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.426
Maybe this will
cheer you up.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.166
Wow!
Yes, wow.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.907
500 cc.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.996
Epi -- it works.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.520
Thank you, Mason.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.261
Look at you,

39:11.305 --> 39:13.742
changing the face
of transplant medicine.

39:13.786 --> 39:16.615
No, no, no, no.
Look at us.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.051
You needed that win.
I did.

39:19.661 --> 39:20.967
Bring her in.
Okay.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.534
Yeah.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.191
Okay.

39:28.235 --> 39:29.236
It's okay.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.589
Oh, my love.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.722
Okay.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.202
Did -- Did it work?

39:39.246 --> 39:41.857
The organ thing, did --
did it work?

39:41.901 --> 39:44.164
It worked.
It was a minor miracle,

39:44.207 --> 39:46.471
but Mason here,
he -- he made it happen.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.343
Please.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.527
You hear that, babe?

40:01.050 --> 40:02.312
You made it happen.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.228
It's okay.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.189
I'm gonna be okay.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.991
I am...

40:30.645 --> 40:32.604
I'm ready to --
I'm just --

40:32.647 --> 40:35.171
I'm ready to...
start over.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.961
I'm gonna
take that offer.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.616
Really?
Yes, really.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.316
<i>Tests don't always measure</i>
<i>how much you know.</i>

40:54.930 --> 40:57.280
<i>They measure how well</i>
<i>you take tests.</i>

41:07.465 --> 41:09.902
<i>And tests certainly don't</i>
<i>measure your worth.</i>

41:12.644 --> 41:14.515
<i>But knowing that</i>
<i>doesn't make it hurt less</i>

41:14.559 --> 41:16.038
<i>when you don't succeed.</i>
