WEBVTT

00:06.084 --> 00:08.251
( theme music playing )

01:01.251 --> 01:02.543
( zips purse )

01:06.876 --> 01:08.292
OK, I'm back.

01:09.710 --> 01:11.418
I can tell you're
not really working, bitch.

01:11.501 --> 01:13.209
I know about iMessage
for the computer.

01:13.292 --> 01:16.835
That's how I failed
to absorb the last month
of my gov seminar.

01:16.918 --> 01:18.418
Was that what
you were wearing?

01:18.501 --> 01:20.668
I just got out of
my stats midterm.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.376
- Was that relevant?
- I don't know, bitch.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.584
Was it relevant?
This is the 500th time
you've made me do this.

01:26.668 --> 01:29.209
Maybe that's the detail
that finally makes sense to you.

01:29.292 --> 01:32.167
Oh, also,
I broke my pencil lead
in the exam,

01:32.251 --> 01:36.126
and I had to get get a refill,
so I had to click it really
loudly for like 30 seconds,

01:36.209 --> 01:38.626
and that stress might
have damaged my psyche.

01:38.710 --> 01:40.793
Also, I had a chicken
Caesar salad for dinner.

01:40.876 --> 01:43.042
I couldn't quite make out
the expiration date
on the dressing,

01:43.126 --> 01:45.710
so I may be battling
the early stages of E. coli.

01:45.793 --> 01:47.334
Is that  relevant?

01:47.418 --> 01:49.835
I forgot what
an asshole I was.

01:49.918 --> 01:53.251
I'm just trying to make sure
that no stone is left unturned
for the great wise elder.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.042
The sooner you get this done,
the sooner you can get on
with your life.

01:56.126 --> 01:57.543
I'm really
shitting my pants

01:57.626 --> 01:59.793
in anticipation
of getting here.

01:59.876 --> 02:01.918
Well, you should,
because you're a writer now.

02:02.001 --> 02:05.001
A playwright. There.
I'll tell you that much.

02:05.084 --> 02:08.001
Sick! Does that mean
I don't have to
go to law school?

02:08.084 --> 02:10.543
Well, you might,
if you don't crack this story

02:10.626 --> 02:13.501
and your agent drops you
and you get blacklisted
from the entire industry,

02:13.584 --> 02:16.334
which is why I actually
need you to work with me
right now.

02:16.418 --> 02:17.459
OK?

02:18.626 --> 02:20.668
I'm sorry, um...

02:20.751 --> 02:22.876
I'm just trying
to figure this out,

02:22.960 --> 02:24.418
and I'm missing something.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.084
OK, well, for the record,

02:28.167 --> 02:29.960
this is what I was wearing
that day.

02:30.042 --> 02:32.292
This is what I would call
the "dress for success" model.

02:32.376 --> 02:34.543
I read this article
before I took the SATs,

02:34.626 --> 02:37.459
and it said that if you dress
professionally before an exam,

02:37.543 --> 02:40.376
you'll subliminally
make yourself more confident
and do better.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.960
I've been doing it ever since.
I got a 2370, as you know,

02:43.042 --> 02:46.084
and I'm pretty sure
I just knocked my stats midterm
out of the park.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.251
Anyway, that's
what I was wearing.
Not that it matters.

02:49.334 --> 02:51.292
It matters to me.

02:53.876 --> 02:57.251
Can you please just
go through it one more time?

02:57.334 --> 02:59.793
Please? For me?

02:59.876 --> 03:02.835
Just guide me through
each step of the night.

03:02.918 --> 03:04.835
Fine.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.835
OK, get up.

03:06.918 --> 03:08.835
Just take me through it
from the beginning

03:08.918 --> 03:10.251
like I've never
heard it before.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.126
You sound like
a dirty cop.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.209
- You ready?
- Yeah.

03:14.292 --> 03:17.126
- OK.
- Let's go.

03:24.084 --> 03:26.835
This is about to be
the perfect Friday night.

03:26.918 --> 03:28.876
Everybody just finished
their first midterms,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.835
so they're either
super-stoked on themselves

03:30.918 --> 03:33.918
for being the brilliant
little prodigies they were
always told they were,

03:34.001 --> 03:36.710
or they're morbidly depressed
and they need to drink
their pain away.

03:36.793 --> 03:38.626
Everyone spent the last
two weeks in the library,

03:38.710 --> 03:41.501
so they're gonna have
all this repressed energy
they need to release,

03:41.584 --> 03:44.418
and that can only be done
by getting into a cramped space

03:44.501 --> 03:46.167
and touching each other.

03:48.334 --> 03:52.209
Oh no! Did I not tell you
that the "dress for success"
model can be modified

03:52.292 --> 03:54.334
to fit a variety
of applications?

03:54.418 --> 03:57.418
You are not nearly  as charming
as you think you are.

03:57.501 --> 04:00.918
And do you  know that
every time you interrupt me
it slows down the process?

04:01.001 --> 04:02.918
- ( door opens )
- Oh. Emily's coming.

04:03.001 --> 04:05.042
( R&B music playing )

04:08.960 --> 04:11.084
I'm not going out tonight.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.251
- Then why are you
dressed like that?
- It's comfortable.

04:14.334 --> 04:17.418
You're wearing a strapless bra.
Comfortable strapless bras
don't exist.

04:17.501 --> 04:18.543
You're coming
out with me.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.042
- Hold, please.
- ( whoosh )

04:20.126 --> 04:21.334
Sorry, I just quickly
want to address

04:21.418 --> 04:23.334
a misconception
about smart girls.

04:23.418 --> 04:25.584
I think people think
their precious daughters

04:25.668 --> 04:29.167
recoil at the scent of alcohol,
or if they come home drunk

04:29.251 --> 04:31.459
it's because someone poured
liquor down their throat.

04:31.543 --> 04:33.501
But in reality,
no other group of people

04:33.584 --> 04:37.584
can get a girl drunk faster
and with more efficacy
than other girls.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.668
( whoosh )

04:38.751 --> 04:40.376
Can we please
just do shots?

04:40.459 --> 04:42.001
I'm really close to hitting
my calorie limit.

04:42.084 --> 04:43.584
I'll set you up.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.376
What do you want?

04:46.459 --> 04:48.876
I'll just have some OJ.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.334
- Getting soft in your old age?
- OK. Just surprise me.

04:52.418 --> 04:55.835
Some girls like vodka
and cranberry juice,

04:55.918 --> 04:57.668
and some girls like
rum and orange juice,

04:57.751 --> 05:00.626
but by far  the most popular
pregame mixer

05:00.710 --> 05:05.167
has gotta be the crippling
dietary restrictions
and body image issues

05:05.251 --> 05:07.584
that we are unable to shed
until we're wasted

05:07.668 --> 05:11.376
and we order and consume
an entire cheese pizza
in 15 minutes.

05:11.459 --> 05:13.001
Cheers.

05:13.084 --> 05:14.793
Thank you.

05:14.876 --> 05:17.501
So you're not gonna
hook up with Derek tonight.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.960
Oh, my god. Why would you
even ask that?

05:20.042 --> 05:22.167
- It's not a question.
- Of course not.

05:22.251 --> 05:24.710
- I'm so done.
- That's what you said
last week.

05:24.793 --> 05:29.543
His name is Derek.
That's like the Kmart
version of Eric.

05:29.626 --> 05:32.876
- ( glasses clink )
- You are so mean.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.876
So is he!
You can't be mean
and  ugly.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.042
You know what?
I heard that Sean-in-Beta
thinks you're hot.

05:40.126 --> 05:42.001
I thought Beta-Sean was gay.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.376
Do you think that
because he showers
every day?

05:44.459 --> 05:48.710
Just focus on Beta-Sean,
and I assure you, you will
forget all about Derek.

05:48.793 --> 05:51.209
Emily:
Fine! Fine.

05:51.292 --> 05:54.960
We're gonna go
and see what it's like,

05:55.042 --> 05:56.835
and if it's fun, it's fun,

05:56.918 --> 05:58.918
and if it's not fun,
we'll leave.

05:59.001 --> 06:01.918
Totally.
But finish your drink.

06:05.459 --> 06:08.626
Got enough info
for your little play?

06:14.459 --> 06:16.292
( rock music booming )

06:19.334 --> 06:21.584
Jesus Christ.

06:21.668 --> 06:23.126
- Sorry.
- ( whoosh )

06:24.334 --> 06:26.251
So, I know what you're thinking.

06:26.334 --> 06:30.459
Why am I standing here
freezing my ass off
outside a fuckin' frat

06:30.543 --> 06:32.668
waiting for some idiots
to deign to let me in

06:32.751 --> 06:36.918
so I can join in
on the unmitigated swamp
of booze and testosterone?

06:37.001 --> 06:40.459
Why am I, a modern woman,
a card-carrying feminist,

06:40.543 --> 06:43.209
subjecting myself
to this war zone?

06:43.292 --> 06:45.167
Don't I know it's kind
of hypocritical

06:45.251 --> 06:46.876
to voluntarily subject myself

06:46.960 --> 06:48.960
to the moral, physical,

06:49.042 --> 06:51.960
and psychological degradation
that comes with that?

06:54.001 --> 06:55.209
Maybe.

06:55.292 --> 06:56.918
But I do it anyway.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.876
Why, you ask?
Have I completely
lost my mind?

07:00.918 --> 07:02.668
( whoosh )

07:02.751 --> 07:04.292
Because I want to.

07:04.376 --> 07:07.292
( door opens, music blaring )

07:07.376 --> 07:09.209
- ( loud party chatter )
- Josie: Yes!

07:09.292 --> 07:12.126
Nobody here knows that
I am a gender studies minor.

07:12.209 --> 07:14.668
I spend all day being critical
and discerning

07:14.751 --> 07:16.459
and posting liberal
Facebook rants,

07:16.543 --> 07:19.459
but no one's dragging me here,
ya know?

07:19.543 --> 07:21.918
I come here of my own volition,

07:22.001 --> 07:24.918
to let loose and dance badly
and kiss boys.

07:25.001 --> 07:28.334
It can be nice to forget
who you're supposed to be.

07:28.418 --> 07:30.042
Thank you, Santa.

07:30.126 --> 07:33.710
One of the frats puts
blood thinners in there
to get you drunk faster.

07:33.793 --> 07:39.292
Sorry, one of the frats
allegedly  puts blood thinners
in it to get you drunk faster.

07:39.376 --> 07:44.501
One of the frats allegedly
has their pledges pee in it
before serving.

07:44.584 --> 07:46.543
Oh, my god, unclench. OK?

07:46.626 --> 07:49.376
And that's not this.
This is just bad.

07:49.459 --> 07:51.001
Besides,
this is my third year here,

07:51.084 --> 07:53.292
I know how to keep
my shit together, right?

07:53.376 --> 07:55.042
Unlike Becky here.

07:56.835 --> 07:59.001
You're in my socy class!

07:59.084 --> 08:01.876
( slurring words )
You have such pretty hair.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.418
Hey, where are your friends?

08:04.501 --> 08:07.167
I don't know, but can you
be my friend, maybe?

08:07.251 --> 08:09.167
I thought I already was
your friend.

08:09.251 --> 08:11.126
Oh, my god!

08:11.209 --> 08:13.042
Josie:
Are you hungry?

08:13.126 --> 08:15.543
- Can we get a pizza?
- Let's definitely do that.

08:15.626 --> 08:18.084
- Can you help me out here?
- Girl: Of course.
Where do you live?

08:18.167 --> 08:20.042
Bradford?
Oh, my god,

08:20.126 --> 08:24.292
it's so shitty.
My roommate is such a fake.

08:24.376 --> 08:25.918
Girl:
Let's go.

08:28.459 --> 08:31.543
Oh, my god, like,
I'm not judging, but--

08:31.626 --> 08:33.376
OK, I'm judging a little bit.

08:33.459 --> 08:36.167
I'm just saying that
this is not my first rodeo.

08:37.459 --> 08:38.710
Hey, Josie.

08:38.793 --> 08:40.751
Hey, fancy meeting
you guys here.

08:40.835 --> 08:42.167
You missed a great time
last night.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.376
Oh, yeah, well,

08:43.459 --> 08:45.167
I did, actually, like,
have to study.

08:45.251 --> 08:47.626
That's kind of the thing
about graduating in four years,

08:47.710 --> 08:48.710
you have to do that.

08:48.793 --> 08:50.126
Can't relate.

08:50.209 --> 08:51.459
Wanna play pong?

08:51.543 --> 08:52.960
Obviously.

08:55.793 --> 08:57.042
( guys whooping )

08:57.126 --> 08:59.042
So there actually is
something you can help me with.

08:59.126 --> 09:02.001
And you're old, so you might
see something that I don't.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.626
- Here's my dilemma.
- ( whoosh )

09:03.710 --> 09:07.126
Over here, that's Donovan,
he is very stupid,

09:07.209 --> 09:10.835
but he kinda has
this douchey-hot thing
going for him,

09:10.918 --> 09:14.626
like a douchebag
was surgically implanted
into a ten-foot-tall child.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.751
But his dad is super-loaded,

09:16.835 --> 09:18.418
so he could kinda come in handy

09:18.501 --> 09:20.501
for a non-disgusting
sugar daddy

09:20.584 --> 09:22.292
to support me while
I'm becoming a writer.

09:22.376 --> 09:23.418
( whoosh )

09:23.501 --> 09:25.793
So he's a great option, ya know?

09:25.876 --> 09:28.584
And then over here
we have Jon.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.084
( whoosh )

09:30.167 --> 09:32.167
Jon will probably make
zero dollars outta graduation

09:32.251 --> 09:33.835
working for Greenpeace
or some shit,

09:33.918 --> 09:35.918
but he has this kind of
self-flagellating brand

09:36.001 --> 09:38.042
of questionably authentic
male feminism

09:38.126 --> 09:40.376
which indicates to me
that he definitely eats pussy,

09:40.459 --> 09:43.376
which is like finding
a diamond in a pile
of horseshit.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.292
It's just a really rare
commodity in this economy.

09:46.376 --> 09:48.668
So, ya know,
they're both great options.

09:48.751 --> 09:50.710
You see my dilemma.
What should I do?

09:50.793 --> 09:53.918
Uh, uh, well,
I think, um--

09:54.001 --> 09:56.793
- Sorry I shouldn't have asked.
You're completely useless.
- ( whoosh )

09:56.876 --> 10:00.668
I'm just gonna go home
with one of them,
so I guess place your bets?

10:00.751 --> 10:02.209
- Hey!
- Ahh! ( giggles )

10:03.251 --> 10:04.626
Right this way,
my lady.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.876
Donovan rushes ahead
right out the gate.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.543
Jon is the dark horse.
Will he give up entirely?

10:10.626 --> 10:13.376
Will he sulk and pick up
an unsuspecting freshman

10:13.459 --> 10:16.376
with a sob story about how,
as a sensitive frat boy,

10:16.459 --> 10:18.960
he's really disgusted with
the behavior of his peers?

10:19.042 --> 10:20.668
Only time will tell.

10:22.376 --> 10:24.251
That kid is gay as fuck.

10:24.334 --> 10:26.876
Oh, no. Are we still
using that as an insult?

10:27.001 --> 10:29.793
Don't you guys have
a rainbow flag in your window?

10:29.876 --> 10:33.209
Yeah, I mean, I support his
right to be gay as fuck 100%.

10:33.292 --> 10:37.167
Oh, god. He's managed
to disappoint me before
he even pulled out his dick.

10:37.251 --> 10:40.668
( rock music blaring )

10:40.751 --> 10:42.751
( all exclaim )

10:47.251 --> 10:51.418
( time fast-forwarding )

11:02.876 --> 11:04.584
Oh!

11:06.543 --> 11:07.584
- Oh--
- ( whoosh )

11:07.668 --> 11:09.793
I know whose Animal House  poster

11:09.876 --> 11:12.501
I'm getting fingered
under tonight.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.167
( whoosh )

11:14.251 --> 11:17.376
( music, chatter continue )

11:17.459 --> 11:19.710
Wait. I actually have to worry
more about appearances,

11:19.793 --> 11:23.042
because it doesn't take much
to get you labeled as a slut
around here.

11:23.126 --> 11:25.418
Qualifiers include
but are not limited to

11:25.501 --> 11:28.793
showing an interest in sex
before midnight. Hmm.

11:28.876 --> 11:31.876
Do you ever think about
just leaving? You're wasted.

11:31.960 --> 11:36.042
No. To leave would be
to admit to everyone that
I'm-- what is the word?--

11:36.126 --> 11:37.668
mature.

11:40.835 --> 11:42.835
- Wait.
- Oh, my god, what?

11:42.918 --> 11:45.084
- Is that a karaoke machine?
- Yeah,

11:45.167 --> 11:47.418
I think the theme
was supposed to be eighties.

11:47.501 --> 11:49.334
Nobody here is dressed
in a theme.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.418
I guess if there was a theme,
you could call it

11:51.501 --> 11:54.835
"Battle of the girls
who are skinny enough
to wear crop-tops

11:54.918 --> 11:57.876
versus the girls who can't,
and are salty about it."

11:57.960 --> 11:59.960
You could totally
wear a crop-top.

12:00.042 --> 12:02.626
No, I couldn't,
and I don't want to anyway.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.251
Yeah, you could.

12:04.334 --> 12:07.167
You could wear
a high-waisted legging
with a control top

12:07.251 --> 12:09.167
and then just show
a sliver of your belly.

12:09.251 --> 12:11.960
If you can drink six beers
and still suck in your stomach,

12:12.042 --> 12:13.251
like, go for it.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.418
This is the time
to do it.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.167
Hell, yeah!
Go topless, even!

12:16.251 --> 12:17.751
- Free the nipple.
- Tits out!

12:17.835 --> 12:19.918
- It's called empowerment.
- Yeah, man.

12:20.001 --> 12:22.167
I'll show you empowerment.

12:22.251 --> 12:23.584
Josie: Sorry.

12:23.668 --> 12:25.251

13:18.793 --> 13:20.501
Do you feel it, feel it?

13:20.584 --> 13:23.501
( laughing )
Can you feel it?

13:23.584 --> 13:25.918
Can you feel it?!

13:27.376 --> 13:29.584
Can you feel it? Whoo!

13:29.668 --> 13:32.084
( crowd clapping, cheering )

13:34.876 --> 13:38.584
Did you see when I died
and then I came back to life?

13:40.876 --> 13:43.626
Are you kidding me?
What is wrong with this guy?

13:43.710 --> 13:45.835
His attention span
is so freaking short.

13:45.918 --> 13:47.918
Maybe he does need
all that Adderall.

13:53.209 --> 13:55.793
( chatter )

13:57.960 --> 14:00.876
- Jon: Yo.
- Josie: Oh, hey.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
Thought I lost you to Donovan
back there.

14:03.042 --> 14:06.042
Oh. No, I just--
I did a lap.

14:06.126 --> 14:09.960
God... I'm pretty wasted.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.960
Doubtful.
That's just an excuse

14:12.042 --> 14:15.042
for whatever insane shit
he's about to say.

14:15.126 --> 14:16.876
Um, yeah, so am I.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.126
Well, do you...
wanna sober up a little?

14:20.209 --> 14:21.835
Uh, yeah?

14:24.292 --> 14:26.292
- ( whoosh )
- I actually do.

14:26.376 --> 14:28.292
I feel like there's always
a point in the night

14:28.376 --> 14:30.751
where you get kinda tired
of being hammered.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.918
Like this one time,
I was so stoned

14:33.001 --> 14:36.209
and I Googled
"How to be less high,"

14:36.292 --> 14:41.418
and then I was so high,
I couldn't read
the Google result.

14:41.501 --> 14:45.543
But, yeah, I wish
I could get sober quickly

14:45.626 --> 14:49.501
when I'm tired
of saying stupid shit
and the room is spinning.

14:50.835 --> 14:52.251
Oh. ( laughs )

14:52.334 --> 14:54.668
This is some
really good shit.

14:56.126 --> 14:58.376
I know what I'm doing.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.710
( door opens )

15:06.042 --> 15:08.376
And you thought
romance was dead.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.751
Wouldn't it be, like,
even more badass

15:13.835 --> 15:16.376
if we just did it
straight off the toilet seat?

15:16.459 --> 15:18.334
We're already
destroying our bodies,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.626
we may as well snort up
some invisible poop particles.

15:21.710 --> 15:24.167
It's like adding
insult to injury.

15:29.876 --> 15:31.376
( sniffing )

15:34.584 --> 15:36.960
Jon: Didn't I tell ya
that was some good stuff?

15:37.042 --> 15:40.334
Yeah, that's great.
I bet they call you El Chapo.

15:40.418 --> 15:43.209
Oh, my god, that's crazy!
How did you know?

15:43.292 --> 15:44.876
( both laugh )

15:46.042 --> 15:47.209
( sniffing )

15:49.584 --> 15:51.167
Let's get outta here.

15:58.209 --> 16:02.209
It's so cool to meet a girl
who does coke.

16:02.292 --> 16:06.001
I don't do coke.
I party, I drink,

16:06.084 --> 16:09.835
I occasionally
abuse a stimulant

16:09.918 --> 16:12.501
that was not prescribed
to me by a medical professional,

16:12.584 --> 16:13.876
but I don't do coke.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.668
( laughs ) OK.

16:15.751 --> 16:17.543
I am cool, though.

16:27.418 --> 16:29.292
( both panting )

16:37.626 --> 16:39.209
( Jon whispers )

16:51.501 --> 16:52.918
( both panting )

16:53.001 --> 16:55.084
Jon: Oh, shit.

17:01.459 --> 17:03.543
You on the pill?

17:03.626 --> 17:05.209
Uh-huh.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.459
Hold, please.

17:08.251 --> 17:09.918
Isn't he dreamy?

17:10.001 --> 17:11.751
I would say that
that is the height of romance,

17:11.835 --> 17:16.918
but I have a friend
who once had a guy
buy Plan B for her.

17:17.001 --> 17:18.876
So that kinda set the bar.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.626
Ow. Ahh.

17:22.793 --> 17:25.668
( both panting )

17:27.584 --> 17:30.084
Ahh. Um...

17:30.167 --> 17:31.584
( laughs )

17:31.668 --> 17:33.334
Ow.

17:42.001 --> 17:43.710
Ow!

17:43.793 --> 17:45.793
Dude, what the fuck!
Jesus!

17:47.668 --> 17:49.960
Can we make out
for two seconds?

17:50.042 --> 17:51.042
Yeah.

17:55.418 --> 17:57.418
You're so beautiful.

17:57.501 --> 18:01.001
I've had a thing for you
for so long.

18:04.001 --> 18:07.001
Wait. Wait.

18:11.543 --> 18:14.376
( groans ) Wait.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.042
Relax.

18:16.126 --> 18:18.126
Is this your first time
or something?

18:18.209 --> 18:19.501
No--

18:22.668 --> 18:24.042
Wait--

18:25.334 --> 18:27.334
( sighs )

18:39.209 --> 18:43.209
( panting )

18:43.292 --> 18:45.167
Wait.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.793
( grunts )

19:05.584 --> 19:07.376
( panting )

19:22.918 --> 19:26.584
Oh, that was--
that was fuckin' great.

19:34.960 --> 19:39.126
Jon (chuckling ):
Where you going?
Wanna stay the night?

19:39.209 --> 19:42.960
Um, I'm--
I got work tomorrow, so..

19:43.042 --> 19:44.793
All right.

19:47.793 --> 19:52.418
Actually, I'm not sure.
I'm just gonna get
a glass of water.

19:52.501 --> 19:53.960
Hurry back.

20:07.751 --> 20:09.793
( urinating )

20:23.251 --> 20:24.459
( grunts )

20:34.918 --> 20:36.710
( toilet flushing )

21:08.459 --> 21:10.584
( door closes )

21:10.668 --> 21:11.918
You get what you needed?

21:12.001 --> 21:13.626
Um, I- I don't--

21:13.710 --> 21:16.584
- ( laughs ) Fuck!
- I'm sorry. I just--

21:16.668 --> 21:19.126
Why do you keep making me
redo this night?

21:19.209 --> 21:21.835
I party all the time,
you have a lot to choose from.

21:21.918 --> 21:23.960
I know, I'm sorry.

21:24.042 --> 21:25.793
And what are you even
writing about?

21:25.876 --> 21:27.418
Binge drinking? Drugs?

21:27.501 --> 21:29.126
I'm clearly not
the poster child

21:29.209 --> 21:31.626
for the next parental
sob story.

21:31.710 --> 21:34.459
Clearly I turn out fine,
or at least OK.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.835
Can you just listen
for a second? Please?

21:36.918 --> 21:39.710
First of all,
I'm not that old.

21:39.793 --> 21:42.376
But I do have enough distance
from where you are

21:42.459 --> 21:45.918
to know that...

21:46.001 --> 21:48.918
most of the specifics
about college

21:49.001 --> 21:50.668
have faded away by now.

21:50.751 --> 21:53.167
You are worried about
so many things

21:53.251 --> 21:54.835
that do not matter anymore.

21:54.918 --> 21:58.793
You're worried about your GPA,
finding a date to formal,

21:58.876 --> 22:00.584
you think your arms
are too fat.

22:00.668 --> 22:03.001
Are you saying my arms
aren't fat?

22:03.084 --> 22:07.543
I'm saying it could be worse,
and you waste too much time
thinking about it.

22:07.626 --> 22:10.084
This stage of our life
is such a blur to me,

22:10.167 --> 22:13.251
and I only remember a few things
really, really vividly.

22:13.334 --> 22:16.459
And this night is
one of those things.

22:19.876 --> 22:22.292
What is your play about?

22:23.626 --> 22:25.668
It's about rape.

22:27.126 --> 22:29.876
Then you need to find
another topic,

22:29.960 --> 22:31.918
because that is not
what happened.

22:32.001 --> 22:34.209
News flash: Frat guys
are bad at sex.

22:34.292 --> 22:36.918
Maybe it wasn't the most
consensual thing, I--

22:37.001 --> 22:38.543
There it is. That's it.

22:38.626 --> 22:40.584
If you can hear one thing
that I say,

22:40.668 --> 22:42.835
please let it be
that there is no such thing

22:42.918 --> 22:44.543
as nonconsensual sex.

22:44.626 --> 22:46.876
There is just consensual sex,
and there is rape.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.710
Those are the only options.

22:48.793 --> 22:52.459
If it's that simple,
then why am I still here?

22:54.042 --> 22:55.710
I kissed him first.

22:55.793 --> 22:58.501
You've seen it a million times.
I kissed him first.

22:58.584 --> 23:02.876
- I know.
- There's no way that--

23:02.960 --> 23:05.084
Ooohhh! Like, aughhh!

23:05.167 --> 23:07.084
I was drunk,
I kissed him first,

23:07.167 --> 23:09.042
there's nothing
that I can do with that.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.376
I'm not telling you
what you should or shouldn't do,

23:11.459 --> 23:15.418
I just want you to know
that it's OK to feel bad
about what happened.

23:15.501 --> 23:17.251
I'm fine.

23:17.334 --> 23:18.918
OK.

23:19.001 --> 23:21.584
You're the one
who's still hung up on it.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.251
I know.

23:23.334 --> 23:25.751
I just--
I need to forget.

23:25.835 --> 23:29.376
I wish that a butterfly
would clap its wings

23:29.459 --> 23:31.084
somewhere between you and I

23:31.167 --> 23:33.042
and then I would
forget about it

23:33.126 --> 23:35.001
before I got to your age.

23:35.084 --> 23:36.876
You don't forget.

23:42.042 --> 23:44.126
Can I go?

23:44.209 --> 23:46.292
( sniffles )
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

23:46.376 --> 23:48.126
You should get some sleep.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.668
Your friends are gonna
randomly decide to go
on a hike tomorrow,

23:50.751 --> 23:55.126
and it's gonna be really fun,
so you should make sure
you're awake on time for that.

23:55.209 --> 23:56.918
OK.

23:59.710 --> 24:01.418
Just really quickly.

24:01.501 --> 24:04.084
I just want to know,
what do I end up doing?

24:04.167 --> 24:07.167
Um, you're a writer.
You know that.

24:07.251 --> 24:09.793
No, I mean about this.

24:09.876 --> 24:12.918
Well, I can't really tell you
what to do.

24:13.001 --> 24:16.459
You'll get here eventually, but
the choices have to be yours.

24:16.543 --> 24:21.084
I should have known
you would say something stupid
and fake-deep like that.

24:24.668 --> 24:27.501
Does it get any easier?

24:27.584 --> 24:29.042
What?

24:30.543 --> 24:34.251
I don't know, like,
um... adulthood?

24:35.918 --> 24:38.918
No.
Just gets different.

24:41.084 --> 24:42.710
OK.

24:42.793 --> 24:45.459
I'll let you
finish your play now.

24:45.543 --> 24:49.001
Sucks that I don't ever
get any better at deadlines.

24:49.084 --> 24:50.876
( sniffles )

24:52.251 --> 24:54.251
Hey, do I get an "A"
in stats?

24:54.334 --> 24:57.418
Oh, my god,
get the fuck
outta here.

24:59.668 --> 25:01.584
( door closes )

25:20.793 --> 25:22.793
( music playing )
