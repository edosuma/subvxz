WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.727
"Now that your hand's better,
who's gonna shake

00:04.770 --> 00:06.738
all the paint around here?"

00:06.770 --> 00:08.590
Okay, that is in
questionable taste.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.800
(laughs)

00:09.840 --> 00:12.138
It was a gift
from the guys for passing

00:12.180 --> 00:13.807
my firearms requalification.
Far as I'm concerned,

00:13.840 --> 00:15.728
under the circumstances,
they can joke all they want.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.408
Well, you know I'm happy
for you, too, right?

00:18.450 --> 00:20.475
Prove it. A bunch of us
are getting together

00:20.520 --> 00:22.215
after work Friday.
You should come.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.615
Your partner, too.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.742
Is that why you asked me here?

00:24.790 --> 00:26.348
To invite us to a party?

00:26.390 --> 00:29.086
Actually, I was hoping
to catch you and Holmes.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.691
A few months back, I was working
a homicide out of East New York.

00:32.730 --> 00:35.255
Drug dealer
named Quame Martenz

00:35.300 --> 00:37.097
shot and killed
a neighborhood kid.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.234
We've liked Martenz
for other shootings before,

00:39.270 --> 00:41.636
but this is the first time
a witness was willing to talk.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.558
At least she was at first.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.238
Name's Nicole Watkins.
She's 18.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.771
ADA's Office
called me this morning,

00:48.810 --> 00:49.845
said she got cold feet.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.279
Told the DA's Office

00:51.310 --> 00:53.278
to stop calling
and dropped out of sight.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.379
You think Martenz
threatened her?

00:55.420 --> 00:56.785
It's a good guess.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.378
DA's Office issued
a material witness order,

00:58.420 --> 00:59.785
but no one can find her.

00:59.820 --> 01:02.129
Thought maybe you guys
could lend some extra eyes?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.459
I'm guessing if she doesn't
testify, Martenz walks.

01:05.490 --> 01:07.094
Probably.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.859
All right, I will let you know

01:08.900 --> 01:10.788
if we come up with anything.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.492
We find her, you're making me

01:13.540 --> 01:15.735
a martini with that thing.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.347
Morning, Sherman.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.371
Miss me?

01:48.370 --> 01:52.477
*

02:01.720 --> 02:03.711
(high-pitched voice):
Who's there?

02:09.490 --> 02:11.879
(gasping)

02:19.200 --> 02:21.339
(gas hissing)

02:21.370 --> 02:23.861
(high-pitched voice):
Please... stop.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.401
I don't want to die.

02:35.580 --> 02:38.481
Name's Barry Granger.
MD, Ph.D.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.680
DOA.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.358
Lab assistant found
him like this

02:41.390 --> 02:45.281
this morning, with this
suicide note in his lap.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.922
"I'm sorry it's all true.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.621
"I can't live any longer
with what I've done.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.389
Barry."

02:50.430 --> 02:52.660
Helium is_common
In labs like this.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.258
And as morbid as it sounds,

02:54.300 --> 02:55.961
it's supposed to be
a good way to go.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.763
Your body
doesn't even know

02:57.810 --> 02:59.368
it's not receiving oxygen.
You just go to sleep.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.399
and you never wake up.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.805
In other words,

03:01.840 --> 03:03.808
at least by appearances,
this man used what was handy

03:03.850 --> 03:06.717
in the workplace to provide
himself with a convenient exit.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.217
But of course you have
your suspicions.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.241
Or else we wouldn't be here.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.882
Granger was the first one in
this morning.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.911
Lab assistant found him alone.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.757
Sweaty running clothes.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.679
Shower stall
in there is wet.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.789
WATSON:
So Dr. Granger ran to work.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.661
And then changed here.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.588
GREGSON:
Who does that

03:24.630 --> 03:25.927
before killing themselves?

03:25.970 --> 03:27.528
It's not like a suicidal guy

03:27.570 --> 03:29.902
would worry about
staying in shape.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.635
WATSON: So what
do you think?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.001
Someone put a gun
to his head,

03:33.040 --> 03:34.803
forced him to do this?

03:34.840 --> 03:35.932
Nothing quite so clumsy.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.277
Have a look at this.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.577
Taclq residue on the bottom
of the door.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.542
And on the floor...

03:43.590 --> 03:46.252
as if someone has
taped the gap shut.

03:46.290 --> 03:47.985
I need something powdery
that won't kill us.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.284
Surprise me.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.344
Care to tell us
what you're domg?

04:09.380 --> 04:11.507
Just a moment.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.858
I think you're right.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.029
Dr. Granger was murdered.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.824
He was asphyxiated with gas
while he showered.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.964
Most likely with helium
so the M.E.'s findings

04:33.000 --> 04:35.298
would match the narrative
that we were meant to believe.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.501
The killer taped three hoses--

04:37.540 --> 04:39.974
une, deux, trois--

04:40.010 --> 04:41.477
under the doorway.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.603
Sealed the gap with tape.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.676
Once the _victim
had lost consaousness...

04:48.950 --> 04:50.781
...he was dried,

04:50.820 --> 04:53.755
clothed, and staged.

04:53.790 --> 04:54.916
Any security videos?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.882
There's none in the lab.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.854
The staff says that's 'cause
the work was confidential.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.993
I did notice a few on
the way in, but...

05:02.030 --> 05:03.691
Given the knowledge
of the lab and the victim

05:03.730 --> 05:04.924
that this murder demonstrates,
it's likely

05:04.970 --> 05:06.699
the killer knew
how to avoid them.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.696
GREGSON: I'm gonna pull
the security video.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.435
I'll let you know
if we get lucky.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.901
Excuse me...

05:17.780 --> 05:20.510
Any idea
what "it's all true" refers to?

05:22.450 --> 05:25.010
A few weeks ago,
Dr. Granger published

05:25.050 --> 05:27.018
the results of a study
that we were doing.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.552
Last week, a reader e-mailed
the journal it was in,

05:30.590 --> 05:31.557
and said
the results were faked.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.750
Were they?

05:32.800 --> 05:33.949
I wouldn't know.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.696
But, uh, he was up
in arms about it.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.631
An accusation like that
can rum a guy's career.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.092
What were you studying?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.859
HOLMES: Is something troubling
about that question?

05:43.910 --> 05:45.969
No, I want to help.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.604
I-I just don't know what I'm
allowed to say. I signed an NDA.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.449
Surely you can tell us
about the contents

05:50.480 --> 05:52.516
of Dr. Granger's article--
that's been made public.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.718
Perhaps you give us the name
of the person who asked you

05:56.750 --> 05:58.980
to sign the NDA and we can
pose our questions to them?

05:59.020 --> 06:02.979
This has to be
the craziest day of my life.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.852
I'd say Barry Granger
had a crazier one.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.856
Barry was my friend.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.868
I'm devastated.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.664
But I'm also personally
screwed by all this.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.167
So excuse me if I'm
a little shell-shocked.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.168
Would you be so kind
as to explain your relationship

06:17.210 --> 06:18.939
to Dr. Granger
and the work he was doing.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.871
I'm sure we'll feel awful
for you momentarily.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.401
That device
that you're holding

06:24.450 --> 06:27.044
is a breathalyzer
that detects cancer.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.844
Well, I read about that
being possible in theory.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.779
Dogs being able to smell
when their owners have cancer.

06:32.820 --> 06:33.980
Apparently cancer
cells give off

06:34.020 --> 06:36.159
different gasses
than healthy ones.

06:36.190 --> 06:39.523
And this device is meant
to detect them in your breath.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.528
Your company holds the patent?

06:42.900 --> 06:45.596
Dr. Granger's connection?

06:45.630 --> 06:48.030
MAN: He was running
clinical trials.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.867
A hundred subjects
known to have lung cancer,

06:49.910 --> 06:50.934
a hundred who don't.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.130
It's a blind study to see

06:52.170 --> 06:53.808
if The Hound gets it right.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.876
"The Hound?"

06:55.910 --> 06:57.946
MAN: Uh, it's just
a working name.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.618
We had to call it something.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.811
We understand
that an anonymous tipster

07:01.850 --> 07:04.546
claimed that Dr. Granger
falsified his results.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.943
It works.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.050
But that accusation
changed everything.

07:09.090 --> 07:11.650
Now no one believes the study.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.829
A month ago,
analysts were calling that

07:13.860 --> 07:15.623
a billion-dollar invention.

07:15.660 --> 07:19.562
And today, my investors
are pulling out.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.568
Might I ask you your whereabouts

07:21.600 --> 07:24.205
this morning around 6:00?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.902
I'm simply coming
around to your point.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.500
The scandal you're referring to
may have cost you a fortune.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.677
If Dr. Granger
did falsify his results,

07:31.710 --> 07:34.178
perhaps someone
killed him in anger.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.939
I'm the last person
who would've hurt Barry.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.686
That detector
is my life's work.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.256
Barry didn't
falsify anything.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.826
Barry didn't jaywalk.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.680
He was a good guy.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.221
And besides, can you imagine
if the police hadn't seen

07:47.260 --> 07:48.693
through that suicide note?
It would have completely

07:48.730 --> 07:50.698
legitimized the accusation.

07:50.730 --> 07:52.095
Sorry, you still haven't
answered my question.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.859
Your whereabouts this morning?

08:05.210 --> 08:07.019
I was with my girlfriend.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.779
I spent the night at her place.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.084
And that's cause
for secrecy because...?

08:11.120 --> 08:14.157
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.589
Your af_fair's
been gomg on

08:15.620 --> 08:17.554
longer than your wife is aware.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.694
If she finds out,
her lawyers'll have a field day.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.891
I never would've hurt Barry.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.192
I was counting on him to help,

08:23.230 --> 08:25.095
help me dig out
from under all this.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.633
And now...

08:30.170 --> 08:32.229
My girlfriend's name

08:32.270 --> 08:34.579
is Sloan Teller.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.976
I'll give you her number
so you can talk to her.

08:37.010 --> 08:40.514
I just ask
that you don't tell my ex.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.008
Hank Prince's girlfriend
backed him up.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.244
Said she was with him
all morning.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.985
Not surprising.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.988
He was telling the truth
when he said he'd be better off

08:50.030 --> 08:51.884
with a live Barry Granger
than a dead one.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.320
Well, score one
for cheating husbands.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.169
Hank Prince may be
a very naughty boy,

08:57.200 --> 08:58.724
but he may also be remembered
for giving the world

08:58.770 --> 09:00.328
a great innovation.

09:00.370 --> 09:03.168
Based on Dr. Granger's study,
"The Hound" appeared

09:03.210 --> 09:04.837
to be quite promising--
or at least it did

09:04.870 --> 09:06.633
until his_ research was
called Into question

09:06.680 --> 09:07.772
by an anonymous tipster.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.232
Correction.
Pseudonymous.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.304
The tipster goes by the name

09:10.350 --> 09:12.568
Adam Peer-- a peer.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.178
And from what I've learned,

09:14.220 --> 09:16.176
he's been quite an irritant
to the research community.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.915
He reads scientific
and medical journals;

09:17.950 --> 09:20.111
he spots errors and
fraud from the comfort

09:20.160 --> 09:21.980
of his undisclosed sofa,

09:22.020 --> 09:25.319
and_ then e-mails his criticisms
vra an anonymous server.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.328
Oh, sounds like something
you would do.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.248
Comparison proudly embraced.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.791
He is, at heart,
a fellow detective.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.730
And one whose track record
IS qurte good.

09:33.770 --> 09:34.794
He's incited a number

09:34.840 --> 09:36.068
of embarrassing retractions.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.328
Hmm.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.337
But you obviously find him

09:38.370 --> 09:39.678
far less interesting than I do.

09:39.710 --> 09:40.938
I'm waiting
for some information

09:40.980 --> 09:42.948
about that girl
that Bell's looking for.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.902
Nicole Watkins.
Yeah, well,

09:44.950 --> 09:46.918
apparently she had
a favorite teacher.

09:46.950 --> 09:49.043
Kind of a surrogate dad.
He's retired now.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.082
I thought maybe she would
get in touch with him.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.815
The school's supposed
to text me his address.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.010
Oh! by the way, Bell is having
a party this Friday.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.209
I thought that we could...

09:56.260 --> 09:57.955
Captain is e-mailing us
a video clip

09:57.990 --> 09:58.957
from the lab's security.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.196
No luck spotting our killer

10:00.230 --> 10:01.629
entering or exiting,
but the cameras

10:01.660 --> 10:02.922
did catch Dr. Granger arguing

10:02.970 --> 10:04.790
with an unidentified woman
two nights ago.

10:04.830 --> 10:05.819
Take a look.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.209
Mm, looks pretty heated.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.936
Dr. Granger...

10:14.980 --> 10:16.971
made a number of calls

10:17.010 --> 10:18.307
from his cell phone

10:18.350 --> 10:20.215
to the same number

10:20.250 --> 10:21.945
in the days leading
up to his death.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.083
A woman named Dalit Zirin.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.849
The last of these calls is

10:24.890 --> 10:27.381
one hour before this argument.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.183
You think that's
the woman in the video.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.757
Well, we can find out.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.955
I'm sorry, it's just...

10:35.000 --> 10:37.867
I can't believe Barry is dead.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.128
May I ask

10:39.170 --> 10:41.661
how you and Dr. Granger
knew each other?

10:41.700 --> 10:43.839
We went to college together.

10:43.870 --> 10:46.703
Barry...

10:46.740 --> 10:48.674
he had a thing for me.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.679
But the feeling wasn't mutual.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.871
I didn't mind back then.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.273
It was cute.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.983
Then last month,
I guess he looked
me up online.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.954
I had to tell him
I still wasn't interested.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.026
I mean, it took some
voice-raising

11:03.060 --> 11:05.688
for him to get the message.

11:05.730 --> 11:06.958
Is something wrong?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.695
No. Thank you
for your time.

11:08.730 --> 11:10.095
Our condolences
for your loss.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.392
Thank you.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.463
Okay, cameras everywhere,
high-tech locks;

11:16.500 --> 11:18.900
obviously not
a travel agency.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.034
And I think she was lying
about her relationship
with Granger.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.106
Agreed and agreed.
Can't say for certain,

11:25.150 --> 11:26.777
but given their cover,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.117
I would guess some sort
of smuggling operation.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.913
One can imagine
any number of scenarios

11:29.950 --> 11:31.110
where Granger saw something
he shouldn't have,

11:31.150 --> 11:32.788
got himself killed.

11:32.820 --> 11:35.118
I'm also quite confident
there were concealed weapons

11:35.160 --> 11:36.787
within reach of every
individual in there,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.388
notable exceptions
being us.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.193
Explains the hasty exit.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.857
Normally, I'm a fan
of confirming if I'm right,

11:41.900 --> 11:43.367
but I think it's best
to contact

11:43.400 --> 11:45.493
Captain Gregson and
let him bring reinforcements.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.964
(phone chimes)
It's Nicole Watkins' school.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.831
They sent me the address of that
retired teacher-- Manny Rose.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.735
(phone chimes)

11:51.770 --> 11:54.330
We should go. The captain says
he'll get a search warrant,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.076
but it might take a couple of
hours to find a friendly judge.

11:57.110 --> 11:58.873
I'll contact you
when I hear from him.

11:58.910 --> 11:59.911
Okay.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.817
I know it's a long shot,
Mr. Rose,

12:02.850 --> 12:06.308
but it sounded like Nicole got
really close to you.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.853
It looks like a lot
of your students do.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.824
I try to help them when I can.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.193
Sometimes it's just
believing in them.

12:14.230 --> 12:16.323
Sometimes it's helping them
stay alive.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.521
Is there any chance
that you've seen her

12:18.570 --> 12:20.265
or been in touch with her?

12:21.940 --> 12:23.828
(whispers):
She's here?

12:25.310 --> 12:29.269
I'd avoid using
the words "police"
or "testify."

12:29.310 --> 12:31.073
At least at first.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.048
Nicole? I'm Joan Watson.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.409
I'm friends with Marcus Bell.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.509
I was hoping
we could talk.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.088
You promised.

12:48.130 --> 12:50.519
I promised not to tell anyone
you were staying here,

12:50.570 --> 12:51.969
and I didn't.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.934
Miss Watson found you
all by herself.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.161
I told the DA's Office
I don't want to talk anymore.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.030
They're not the ones
who sent me. Marcus did.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.809
He just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.306
I'm not.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.545
There are people out there
that want to kill me.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.740
If you're being threatened,
there are measures...

13:07.780 --> 13:10.943
Measures.
...that the department
can take to protect you.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.987
Measures aren't good enough.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.782
Not anymore.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.090
You're pregnant.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.492
(phone chimes)

13:32.240 --> 13:33.434
(phone rings)

13:33.480 --> 13:34.936
Captain.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.402
Are you sure you e-mailed me

13:36.440 --> 13:38.442
the right address
of that travel agency?

13:38.480 --> 13:39.947
Quite sure.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.572
This place is empty.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.043
Not just unoccupied.
I mean, cleared out.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.910
I can't say I'm surprised.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.009
I've continued my own search
for information on Ms. Zirin.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.413
Over the last several years,

13:49.460 --> 13:51.087
she's done an impressive job
of not existing.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.324
(doorbell rings)

13:52.360 --> 13:53.918
My apologies
for the inconvenience.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.325
At least we've confirmed

13:55.360 --> 13:57.066
that they were up
to something untoward.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.022
I'll find out who owns
the building,

13:59.070 --> 14:00.230
get the name on the lease.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.464
If I find out anything
interesting,

14:01.500 --> 14:02.933
I'll give you a call.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.232
Thank you.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.011
Ms. Zirin.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.987
At my home.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.056
May I come in?

14:20.090 --> 14:22.058
Depends on your intentions.

14:22.090 --> 14:25.548
Well, obviously, you realized
I'm not a travel agent.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.626
I'm Mossad.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.621
_ _And_ what is the _
Israeli Intelligence community's

14:31.670 --> 14:33.092
interest in Barry Granger?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.199
None, actually.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.630
But let me in and I'll tell you
who I think killed him.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.439
The part about me and Barry
meeting in college was true.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.345
Columbia.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.642
Barry was pre-med,
I was computer science.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.988
Your citizenship?
Dual.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.921
I was raised here mostly,
but my parents are Israeli.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.154
Hmm.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.454
So why are you here?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.424
I'm here because I care
about Barry.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.961
He is my friend.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.504
And because you left me
very little choice.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.962
Oh?

15:12.010 --> 15:14.035
I know you're still prying.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.672
Better that I just tell you

15:15.710 --> 15:18.440
and get you to look for Barry's
killer in the right place.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.368
Well, since you're obviously
in the mood for sharing,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.240
Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what you and your colleagues

15:22.280 --> 15:23.588
were up to
at the travel agency.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.713
Nothing the American government
would frown on.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.389
Nothing they're aware of,
either.

15:28.420 --> 15:32.527
So if it wasn't your affection
Barry was after, what was it?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.996
Someone sent an e-mail
to a medical journal

15:36.030 --> 15:37.190
accusing him of fraud.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.596
Adam Peer.
That was a pseudonym.

15:39.630 --> 15:42.599
Barry wanted me to find out
who really sent it.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.437
He knew what I really did.

15:44.470 --> 15:47.735
We were in a relationship
when I was first recruited.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.338
But I told him no.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.541
He was asking me
to break multiple laws.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.674
So Dr. Granger spent his final
days looking for Adam Peer,

15:54.720 --> 15:56.745
and you think Adam Peer killed
him for his troubles.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.316
Well, whoever Peer is,

15:58.350 --> 16:00.614
he may value his secrecy enough
to kill for it.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.683
When I heard what happened
to Barry,

16:04.730 --> 16:07.255
I felt terrible
about turning him away.

16:08.660 --> 16:12.118
So I broke some laws after all.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.661
I couldn't identify Peer,
but I did hack the servers

16:14.700 --> 16:16.634
at some of the journals
he'd written to.

16:16.670 --> 16:20.106
Those are all the
e-mails I could find.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.778
You're giving them
to me because...?

16:21.810 --> 16:25.143
Well, thanks to you,
my unit's being reassigned.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.239
So you can take it from here.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.145
You seem to know
what you're domg.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.283
Maybe you can find

16:30.320 --> 16:32.242
the person who killed Barry...

16:32.290 --> 16:34.212
and see that they pay.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.790
She know who the dad is?

16:40.830 --> 16:42.149
WATSON:
Her boyfriend.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.565
He's working two jobs,

16:43.600 --> 16:45.295
he wants to support them...

16:45.330 --> 16:46.524
well, it's gonna be tough.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.037
You were right.
She's a good kid.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.662
But when she promised
to testify,

16:49.700 --> 16:51.463
she didn't know what
she was getting herself into.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.728
Now that she's pregnant...

16:53.780 --> 16:56.271
I mean, she wants to have a
future and not just for herself.

16:56.310 --> 16:59.199
You said she was crashing
with some old teacher?

16:59.250 --> 17:00.740
Yes. His name is Manny Rose.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.714
Manny Rose?

17:02.750 --> 17:03.819
What, you know him?

17:03.850 --> 17:05.511
Personally, no.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.778
But I know the legend.

17:08.490 --> 17:11.584
When I was...
I don't know, ten or 11,

17:11.630 --> 17:14.155
he was a history teacher
over at Rooker High.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.293
Couple bangers showed up
one day, tried to drag

17:16.330 --> 17:18.423
one of his kids
out of his class.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.098
They didn't know
Mr. Rose also helped coach

17:21.140 --> 17:22.289
the JV baseball team.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.638
Chased 'em off with a bat.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.729
He seemed like a good man.

17:26.770 --> 17:28.431
Yeah, I didn't realize
Nicole knew him.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.209
Guess there's a lot
I didn't know about her.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.582
(sighs heavily)

17:39.620 --> 17:41.781
Oh, you're still
going over those?

17:41.820 --> 17:45.278
_Mm._When an Israeli
intelligence operative

17:45.330 --> 17:46.649
hands you a collection of
illegally obtained e-mails,

17:46.690 --> 17:48.453
you don't just
skim them, Watson.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.797
I don't understand why

17:49.830 --> 17:51.366
you're just taking
her word for it.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.197
I take no one
at their word.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.366
But Adam Peer's gone to quite
extraordinary lengths

17:54.400 --> 17:55.697
to conceal_his
true identity.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.061
A little murder hardly
seems out of bounds.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.599
An Officer Mulgrew
called for you.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.346
I assume you've
taken on

18:04.380 --> 18:05.745
another investigative
side project?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.213
Actually, no.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.615
He's helping me
with a gift for Marcus.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.345
Which reminds me:
We never finished talking...

18:10.390 --> 18:11.618
Zirin and her team effectively
disappeared last night.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.186
She didn't have to come here.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.858
She could've been
on her merry way.

18:14.890 --> 18:16.619
Why do you keep doing that?

18:16.660 --> 18:18.218
Doing what?
Cutting me off

18:18.260 --> 18:19.386
whenever I talk
about Marcus's party.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.749
You did that to me
yesterday, too.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.098
Because I'm not going
to the party.

18:24.430 --> 18:27.638
(Holmes clears throat,
sighs)

18:27.670 --> 18:29.592
Why don't you want
to go to the party?

18:29.640 --> 18:31.369
I'm sorry, sorry,
have we met?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.901
Hi, hi. My name is Sherlock.
I'm a recovering drug addict.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.239
You know, you bear a striking
resemblance to a sobriety
counselor I once knew.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.613
What's that you say?
Triggers abound in bars? Hmm.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.914
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was in a bar.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.508
Mullane's-- I heard it
from the captain.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.411
Is that really why
you don't want to go?

18:52.430 --> 18:54.648
You know, there
are certain milestones--

18:54.700 --> 18:57.828
an officer making detective,
a retirement, a wake,

18:57.870 --> 18:59.622
an injured man returning
to full duty--

18:59.670 --> 19:01.535
which belong
to the police, right?

19:01.570 --> 19:02.935
It's their night.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.460
It's their chance
to raise a glass

19:04.510 --> 19:06.501
surrounded by their brethren.

19:06.540 --> 19:09.907
It is a fraternity to which--
my countless contributions
notwithstanding--

19:09.940 --> 19:12.272
I will always remain
an outsider.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.177
And given my role in starting
Detective Bell down his detour,

19:15.220 --> 19:16.539
it seems inappropriate

19:16.580 --> 19:18.912
that I be part of
celebrating his return.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.679
Okay, I get it.

19:21.990 --> 19:25.426
Okay, so if Adam Peer is
so prolific,

19:25.460 --> 19:28.258
why have they not been able to
track his writing location yet?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.291
He employs a technique called
"onion routing."

19:30.330 --> 19:32.560
A message passes through
multiple servers,

19:32.600 --> 19:35.296
each one with encrypted
instructions for passing
it on to the next step.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.309
Now, no single layer has any
knowledge of the other steps,

19:38.340 --> 19:41.275
making it virtually impossible
to trace_the letter back
to its source.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.198
This is the Toproxefin case.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.877
You're familiar with it?

19:44.910 --> 19:45.899
It's a painkiller that the FDA

19:45.950 --> 19:47.747
rejected about four years ago,

19:47.780 --> 19:49.975
after the drug company sank
millions of dollars into it.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.681
That was Adam Peer.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.483
It was his first.
Now you're impressed.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.249
No, it was a big deal.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.609
When it came out

19:56.660 --> 19:58.252
that researchers cherry-picked
their data,

19:58.290 --> 19:59.723
they only disclosed
positive results,

19:59.760 --> 20:02.456
and they hid the fact they knew
it caused nerve damage.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.991
This drug company,
Merrill-Grand, ended up

20:05.030 --> 20:06.725
paying a huge fine.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.489
Well, there was a researcher
who, who tried

20:09.540 --> 20:10.802
to warn upper management

20:10.840 --> 20:12.467
about the misconduct but...

20:12.510 --> 20:15.968
You said
this was Adam Peer's first?

20:16.010 --> 20:19.468
Don't serial anythings
usually start close to home?

20:21.450 --> 20:24.908
Toproxefin was
an embarrassing chapter...

20:24.950 --> 20:27.714
for me
and for the whole company.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.387
But it was never
willful fraud,

20:29.420 --> 20:31.456
not at the
corporate level.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.288
Sometimes when there's that much
money at stake,

20:34.330 --> 20:37.026
you develop a kind
of selective deafness.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.494
Yes, well, you say tomato...

20:39.530 --> 20:41.293
We're not here to judge you.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.739
Miss Buckner,
you were in charge

20:42.770 --> 20:44.260
of New Products
at the time?

20:44.310 --> 20:46.460
We thought you could tell us
about the researcher

20:46.510 --> 20:48.603
who first raised concerns
about the drug.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.040
Because the police think
he killed someone.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.900
We just want
to ask him some questions.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.679
Okay.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.369
His name is Lawrence Cranford.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.912
He was a neurochemist
on one of the study teams.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.282
He quit after his
warnings were ignored.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.379
Do you know how
we can find him?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.728
He dropped out of sight
after that.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.591
Did you or anyone else
at Merrill-Grand

21:08.630 --> 21:10.894
ever consider that
he might be Adam Peer?

21:10.930 --> 21:12.329
Of course we did.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.667
When the whole thing happened,

21:13.700 --> 21:15.531
our investigators
tried to find him.

21:15.570 --> 21:16.867
But he'd moved.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.800
It was like he'd
gone off the grid.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.728
And then when
the FDA rejected it

21:20.780 --> 21:21.929
and the drug was dead aanay,

21:21.980 --> 21:23.948
we just dropped the whole thing.

21:23.980 --> 21:26.540
I can get you
what we have on him.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.042
MANNY: Nicole's
at the doctor's.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.682
It's only a couple
of blocks away.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.654
She should
be here soon.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.555
I remember this park
when I was a kid.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.023
You couldn't even
walk through it.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.366
This dealer,
Martenz...

21:44.400 --> 21:45.924
how bad?

21:45.970 --> 21:47.699
He's pretty bad.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.560
Deals crack, heroin...

21:49.600 --> 21:50.965
works in
Cypress Hills.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.376
He uses kids
as go-betweens,

21:53.410 --> 21:54.809
sinstougher
to pin him down.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.102
Sorry, I have
to ask...

21:56.140 --> 21:58.370
is that the bat?

21:58.410 --> 21:59.570
No.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.975
I'm not that proud.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.887
That's a gift from
a kid I used to coach.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.114
He's in the minors now.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.015
Arm like a cannon.
(chuckles)

22:08.620 --> 22:10.019
Nicole'll come
around, Detective.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.654
I'll see to it.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.749
Actually, Mr. Rose...

22:14.800 --> 22:16.722
that's not why I came.
I, uh...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.899
I wanted to tell her it's okay.
I understand.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.932
She doesn't have to do anything
she doesn't want to do.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.597
The DA's Office
has their guy,

22:22.640 --> 22:24.130
and there's
other evidence.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.865
They'll just have to make
the best case they can.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.605
And who knows,
maybe Martenz'll plead out,

22:27.640 --> 22:28.937
do a little time.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.800
Doesn't feel right

22:30.850 --> 22:32.772
to try to talk her
into testifying.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.472
Martenz killed a boy.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.010
A good boy.

22:37.050 --> 22:40.019
She can explain to a jury
exactly what happened.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.814
(phone blips)

22:42.860 --> 22:44.782
I'm sorry;
I'm getting called away.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.479
It's another case.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.952
Would you tell her
what I said?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.525
Thanks for the water.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.599
(door closes)

22:57.540 --> 22:59.167
No luck finding
Lawrence Cranford?

22:59.210 --> 23:01.633
Worse luck.
Did find him.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.898
Lawrence Cranf_ord was
apparently so disgusted

23:03.950 --> 23:06.043
by his experience
with Big Pharma--

23:06.080 --> 23:09.117
and I quote from his resignation
letter to Merrill-Grand:

23:09.150 --> 23:11.015
"...a company
so poisoned by profits

23:11.050 --> 23:12.642
"that even the few
good souls who remember

23:12.690 --> 23:13.987
why they got into health care
are silenced"--

23:14.020 --> 23:16.580
that he drove
to MeXIco,

23:16.620 --> 23:18.588
took up surfing,
and settled in Baja,

23:18.630 --> 23:20.723
where he was killed

23:20.760 --> 23:23.968
by a rash of unseasonably
rough waves in 2012...

23:24.000 --> 23:25.729
placing my degree of certainty

23:25.770 --> 23:28.637
that he is not Adam Peer
at around 100%.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.931
Bullet-riddled man.

23:31.970 --> 23:33.574
Is the decor in here not
American enough for you?

23:33.610 --> 23:34.907
We could get
some Rockwells,

23:34.940 --> 23:36.077
deep fat fryer...

23:36.110 --> 23:37.475
No, this is the gift

23:37.510 --> 23:38.943
I was telling you about,
for Marcus.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.016
It's the target from
his requalification test.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.210
Officer Mulgrew is
a firearms instructor.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.649
He pulled it for me.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.579
It's a nice grouping.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.983
WATSON:
Hmm.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.521
Other potential
Adam Peers?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.118
Each of them,
at some point today.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.890
Other researchers,
executives at Merrill-Grand

23:58.930 --> 24:01.239
involved in the development
of Toproxefin.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.864
So you think Adam Peer was
someone else inside the company.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.708
Unfortunately, I've also already
eliminated each of them,

24:06.740 --> 24:08.708
as either a coconspirator
in the fraud

24:08.740 --> 24:10.799
or unaware of it
until after the scandal broke.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.671
Lawrence Cranford
is the only individual

24:13.720 --> 24:15.813
who knew that his teammates
were concealing negative data,

24:15.850 --> 24:16.976
but was not himself

24:17.020 --> 24:18.544
part of the deceit.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.478
Well, it has to be
someone else he told.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.854
According to
his own e-mails,

24:22.890 --> 24:24.721
he only told a
handful of higher-ups

24:24.760 --> 24:26.580
who rejected his warnings.

24:27.930 --> 24:30.990
Unless, of course,
one of them didn't.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.865
"...even the few good souls

24:34.900 --> 24:36.993
who remember why they
got into health care..."

24:37.040 --> 24:39.702
He wasn't talking about himself.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.833
One of the higher-ups
tried to do the right thing

24:41.880 --> 24:43.541
and Cranford knew it.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.717
WATSON:
Ms. Buckner!

24:49.750 --> 24:51.183
Oh, I'm sorry,

24:51.220 --> 24:52.744
I'm actually late
for an appointment...

24:52.790 --> 24:54.189
No, no, I'm sure you
can spare us a moment.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.778
Alternatively, we could
head up to your superiors

24:55.820 --> 24:57.014
and share with them
our suspICIons

24:57.060 --> 24:58.186
that you're Adam Peer.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.790
In 2008,
you headed a panel

25:00.830 --> 25:02.525
examining the
corrosive effect

25:02.560 --> 25:04.528
of profit margins on
American health care.

25:04.570 --> 25:05.696
And you must have known
this would go over poorly

25:05.730 --> 25:07.061
with your new bosses,

25:07.100 --> 25:08.636
'cause you left it off
your resume

25:08.670 --> 25:11.104
when you applied here.
How did you...?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.903
When Lawrence Cranford shared
his concerns about Toproxefin,

25:12.940 --> 25:14.976
you wanted to stop the drug.
But you couldn't.

25:15.010 --> 25:16.602
Not without losing your job.
You created

25:16.640 --> 25:18.779
Adam Peer as a way to blow
the whistle anonymously.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.004
And when your bosses
still thought

25:20.050 --> 25:21.278
_ it was someone
in5ide the company,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.174
you were able
to deflect suspicion,

25:23.220 --> 25:25.085
because you were the one
in charge of finding him.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.849
According to the files
you gave us,

25:26.890 --> 25:29.609
you sent your investigators
looking for Cranford.

25:29.660 --> 25:32.049
He looked the part,
but you only needed to
run out the clock.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.694
As soon as the FDA
rejected the drug,

25:33.730 --> 25:35.197
you were also the person
who called off the search.

25:35.230 --> 25:37.596
I'm quite certain a thorough
scan of your computer

25:37.630 --> 25:39.598
would reveal some_ of
Adam Peer's footprints.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.837
We don't have a warrant, but...

25:41.870 --> 25:43.132
we're betting
that your employers

25:43.170 --> 25:44.831
will cooperate without one.

25:46.970 --> 25:49.939
You're only half right.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.642
Because I'm only
half of "Adam Peer."

25:52.680 --> 25:53.942
You have a partner.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.140
Had.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.683
Barry.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.915
The two of us were
Adam Peer together.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.815
The murder victim
Barry Granger.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.158
I would never have hurt him.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.886
And you already know
he didn't hurt himself.

26:06.930 --> 26:08.693
I'm sorry, but...

26:08.730 --> 26:10.618
if you thought
Adam Peer killed him...

26:10.670 --> 26:12.262
you were wrong.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.933
KAREN: I already told
your consultants

26:21.980 --> 26:23.106
this e-mail didn't
come from us.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.141
I didn't send it,

26:24.180 --> 26:25.340
and Barry obviously
didn't discredit himself.

26:25.380 --> 26:27.348
Someone hijacked our pseudonym

26:27.380 --> 26:30.986
and used it to attack
Barry's study.

26:31.020 --> 26:34.319
That's quite a hobby
you two had going.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.316
How did it start?

26:36.360 --> 26:38.157
(clears throat)

26:38.190 --> 26:39.987
Barry and I met at a conference

26:40.030 --> 26:42.055
about a year before
the Toproxefin scandal.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.398
We shared a lot of
the same concerns...

26:44.430 --> 26:47.866
including the influence
of money on good science.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.765
So you came up with the idea
of Adam Peer together.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.928
At first, it was just a way
to expose Toproxefin.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.279
And it worked.
We got away with it.

26:55.310 --> 26:57.039
And then,
a few months later,

26:57.080 --> 26:58.775
Barry was reading an article
in another journal

26:58.810 --> 27:01.074
and he noticed
that some pictures

27:01.120 --> 27:03.213
of tissue samples
were duplicates.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.013
Adam Peer already existed,

27:05.050 --> 27:07.689
so we used him again.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.881
And then we started
looking for things.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.353
Plagiarism,

27:11.390 --> 27:14.029
data that was
too perfect...

27:14.060 --> 27:16.358
Before we knew it,
Adam Peer had become

27:16.400 --> 27:18.095
something bigger
than either of us.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.392
Why didn't you say something

27:19.430 --> 27:21.091
when Dr. Granger was killed?

27:21.140 --> 27:22.892
WATSON: Because it
would have meant

27:22.940 --> 27:24.305
undoing all the good
that Adam Peer had done.

27:24.340 --> 27:26.763
If it came out
that you were

27:26.810 --> 27:28.698
an exec at a big drug company,

27:28.740 --> 27:30.776
it would've looked like any
rival study you'd debunked

27:30.810 --> 27:32.778
was motivated by greed.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.843
Barry and I talked
about coming forward

27:35.880 --> 27:37.848
after he was accused of fraud.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.414
He refused,

27:39.450 --> 27:41.384
even to clear his own name.

27:41.420 --> 27:43.251
He knew that eventually

27:43.290 --> 27:44.882
his work would
defend itself.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.396
So when he died, I...

27:49.430 --> 27:51.295
I did what I thought
he would have wanted.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.730
Which was nothing.

27:53.770 --> 27:54.930
Can you account
for your whereabouts

27:54.970 --> 27:56.392
Wednesday morning
about 6:00 am?

27:56.440 --> 27:58.169
Uh, I was just
coming off

27:58.210 --> 27:59.859
of a red-eye from
San Francisco

27:59.910 --> 28:01.400
with about a half-dozen
of my colleagues.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.771
Their numbers
are in my phone;

28:02.810 --> 28:04.072
they'll confirm it.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.277
You're gonna tell them,
aren't you?

28:08.750 --> 28:10.047
You're gonna tell everyone

28:10.080 --> 28:11.786
the truth about Adam Peer.

28:13.020 --> 28:14.851
The device that _
Dr. Granger was testing

28:14.890 --> 28:17.757
could save countless lives.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.985
And the person
who attempted to decry it

28:20.030 --> 28:22.794
was an imposter, so...

28:22.830 --> 28:25.162
how could we not?

28:27.170 --> 28:29.195
So why go to the trouble
of discrediting Barry Granger

28:29.240 --> 28:30.867
when you're going
to kill him aanay?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.468
To explain the suicide?

28:34.140 --> 28:35.437
but his work.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.833
Consider the combined effect

28:36.880 --> 28:38.472
of the killer's plan:

28:38.510 --> 28:40.375
You lob an accusation of fraud

28:40.410 --> 28:41.968
and then stage it to look like

28:42.020 --> 28:43.885
Granger killed himself
in shame.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.740
So you think this is
corporate espionage?

28:45.790 --> 28:47.143
Loathe as I am to admit it,

28:47.190 --> 28:48.953
Granger's benefactor Hank Prince

28:48.990 --> 28:50.218
may be right
when he sees himself

28:50.260 --> 28:51.488
as the victim
in all this.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.452
PRINCE:
I can't believe it.

28:53.490 --> 28:55.958
Barry was Adam Peer.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.298
Just not the one who called
your invention into question.

28:58.330 --> 29:00.389
We've notified the journal
his study appeared in

29:00.430 --> 29:01.988
the_e-mail
accusmg fraud

29:02.040 --> 29:03.359
was, in fact,
fraud itself.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.106
Might not be
the same as having

29:05.140 --> 29:06.937
Dr. Granger back
to clear his name,

29:06.970 --> 29:08.938
but it should reassure
your investors

29:08.980 --> 29:10.948
and expedite the vetting
of the good doctor's work.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.777
Thank you.

29:12.810 --> 29:15.176
You have no idea how much time
you've just saved me.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.211
But... what now?

29:17.250 --> 29:21.858
Obviously, "Adam Peer"
didn't kill Barry, so who did?

29:21.890 --> 29:23.380
We believe it was _
someone who had motive

29:23.420 --> 29:24.819
to attack you
and your work.

29:24.860 --> 29:25.986
Is it safe to assume

29:26.030 --> 29:27.224
The Hound has
competition?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.352
Well, of course.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.493
Any particular rivals
spring to mind?

29:30.530 --> 29:32.521
I'll write you a list.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.799
BELL:
Mr. Rose.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.364
Everything
all right?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.460
I had a talk with
Nicole this morning.

29:40.510 --> 29:41.977
I told her
that I thought

29:42.010 --> 29:44.274
that testifying was
the right thing to do.

29:44.310 --> 29:47.245
It did not go well.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.838
She left.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.338
Went to stay with
family of hers upstate.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.210
Sorry to hear that.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.854
But, you know, like I told you
the other day...

29:56.890 --> 29:58.528
she needs to do
what she needs to do.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.027
I want to take her place.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.095
What?

30:01.130 --> 30:02.825
I want to testify in her place.

30:02.860 --> 30:06.091
Nicole and I must've
talked a thousand times.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.427
about what she saw that night.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.268
I know every detail,
inside and out.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.803
You understand
that's perjury, right?

30:13.610 --> 30:15.009
You could go to jail,

30:15.040 --> 30:16.507
I could lose my shield...

30:16.540 --> 30:18.849
And do you really think
Martenz's attorney

30:18.880 --> 30:20.279
wouldn't see
right through it?

30:20.310 --> 30:22.870
You coming fonNard,
months after the shooting,

30:22.920 --> 30:24.512
just as Nicole backs out?

30:24.550 --> 30:26.415
He'd eat you alive on the stand

30:26.450 --> 30:28.179
and Martenz would still go free.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.251
Mr. Rose, I'm confused.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.427
I-I know you.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.859
I know how
much you did

30:33.900 --> 30:35.891
for your school,
your community...

30:35.930 --> 30:37.591
How much?

30:39.300 --> 30:41.291
How much have I done?

30:42.970 --> 30:46.064
Would you want your child
to go to Rooker High?

30:47.570 --> 30:50.130
Would you want to raise them
in my neighborhood?

30:50.180 --> 30:52.444
You really don't think
you made a difference?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.415
Quame Martenz shot that boy

30:55.450 --> 30:57.042
right in front of Nicole.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.583
Didn't care that he had
a family that loved him.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.485
Didn't care what that
would do to Nicole.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.387
I have poured my life's blood

31:04.430 --> 31:07.479
into this neighborhood.

31:07.530 --> 31:11.193
Never did anything
but the right thing.

31:11.230 --> 31:14.939
You know, I stood up
to 'bangers, too, once.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.597
I was 12.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.461
They tried to get me
to join up.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.229
They beat me half to death.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.429
But you know what?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.243
I didn't end up in any gang.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.942
And neither did a lot of kids.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.572
It's because of you.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.918
Look, go home, okay?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.019
Let me worry about Martenz.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.550
We don't get him this time,

31:37.590 --> 31:39.922
we will get him the next.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.996
You have my word.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.365
Well, from what I can tell,
the company closest

31:51.410 --> 31:52.559
to getting another
cancer-detection device

31:52.610 --> 31:54.237
on the market is called

31:54.280 --> 31:55.702
Radner Science.
They're one of the biggest

31:55.740 --> 31:57.947
medical device companies
in the world.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.181
Who's winning?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.585
I'm having second thoughts.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.611
About?
Tomorrow night's festivities.

32:07.650 --> 32:09.709
I'm pleased
for Detective Bell.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.126
He's accomplished quite a lot
in these last few months.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.390
He deserves to be feted.

32:14.430 --> 32:16.125
Okay, first things first.

32:17.530 --> 32:18.667
I'm not worried about triggers.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.224
I'm worried I'll distract.

32:20.270 --> 32:21.669
As I said...
He would not
have invited you

32:21.700 --> 32:23.395
if he didn't want you there.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.737
(grunts)

32:24.770 --> 32:28.001
Misanthropy was so easy, Watson.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.268
Elegant.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.005
I miss it sometimes.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.177
(phone rings)

32:34.680 --> 32:35.977
Captain?

32:36.020 --> 32:37.419
I thought you'd want to know

32:37.450 --> 32:39.145
that guy that was working
with Barry Granger,

32:39.190 --> 32:41.750
Hank Prince,
he's at the station.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.087
Did something happen?

32:43.120 --> 32:44.485
You could say that.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.987
His estranged wife was shot dead

32:47.030 --> 32:48.554
a few hours ago, in her home,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.228
with a gun registered to him.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.693
He's under arrest for murder.

33:00.470 --> 33:01.505
I didn't hurt my wife, okay?

33:01.540 --> 33:03.098
I would never hurt my wife.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.641
That why she took out
a restraining order

33:04.680 --> 33:07.740
against you three months ago?

33:07.780 --> 33:09.509
PRINCE: Her lawyer
put her up to that.

33:09.550 --> 33:11.347
We had an argument
on the phone, okay?

33:11.390 --> 33:13.415
That was it.
Well, according
to her statement,

33:13.450 --> 33:17.079
the argument got heated,
you argued about the divorce,

33:17.120 --> 33:20.487
and you told her you weren't
gonna let her take a dime.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.350
She was being
unreasonable.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.027
Look, for the last time,

33:24.070 --> 33:25.662
I was in a cab
with my girlfriend

33:25.700 --> 33:27.224
when Andrea was shot.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.090
Her name is Sloan Teller.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.108
We were going from her place
to my place.

33:31.140 --> 33:33.233
You got a medallion number,
driver's name,

33:33.270 --> 33:35.033
anything at all we can use
to confirm your story?

33:35.080 --> 33:37.173
'Cause the whole "my girlfriend
is my alibi" thing

33:37.210 --> 33:39.542
is starting to wear
a little thin.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.775
I got a receipt, I think.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.584
I-I-I would've left it on
my counter when I got home.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.546
Are you two seriously
just gonna stand there?

33:47.590 --> 33:49.148
Tell him what

33:49.190 --> 33:51.385
you told me today.
We went to see Mr. Prince

33:51.430 --> 33:54.649
because we believe someone was
targeting him and his work.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.792
PRINCE:
You hear that?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.252
Someone is after me.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.165
Someone_ who wants
my deVIce to fail.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.532
First they wrote that letter
to discredit Barry's study.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.697
Then they killed him.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.560
But your people saw
through all that,

34:05.610 --> 34:07.760
so now they're framing me
for Andrea's murder.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.471
She was killed with your gun.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.579
Which must've
been stolen

34:10.610 --> 34:13.374
from my home.

34:13.410 --> 34:14.775
They found it on
the coffee table

34:14.820 --> 34:17.209
a few feet
from Andrea's body, right?

34:17.250 --> 34:21.254
Tell me, what kind of idiot
would I have to be

34:21.290 --> 34:23.679
to kill my wife
with my own gun

34:23.720 --> 34:27.178
and then just
leave it behind?

34:27.230 --> 34:28.857
You know what?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.527
I'm done talking.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.597
I-I want my lawyer.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.632
Either this guy did the
dumbest job shooting his ex

34:35.670 --> 34:37.729
I've ever seen, or someone's
doing a really good job

34:37.770 --> 34:39.306
ruining his life.
Mm.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.604
The man developed a machine
for detecting cancer

34:41.640 --> 34:43.676
via exhalations--
I don't think he's dumb.

34:43.710 --> 34:44.847
You think he's telling
the truth?

34:44.880 --> 34:46.177
Someone's setting him up?

34:46.210 --> 34:47.541
He had motive
to kill his wife,

34:47.580 --> 34:48.877
there were no signs
of forced entry,

34:48.920 --> 34:50.512
so she probably knew
her attacker,

34:50.550 --> 34:52.643
his gun was the murder weapon.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.817
But there were no prints on it,
and he does have a point.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.487
He'd have to be an idiot
to kill her this way.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.488
Well, I'm gonna send a team
to his house

34:58.530 --> 35:00.259
to find that receipt.
We don't find it,

35:00.290 --> 35:02.622
he better pray
you two figure out

35:02.660 --> 35:04.491
who's gunning for him.

35:12.370 --> 35:14.634
I'm dreaming this, right?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.739
You're not seriously
waking me up again.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.509
The detectives who searched
Hank Prince's home

35:18.550 --> 35:20.438
found the taxi receipt,
just like he said they would.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.311
They identified the cab driver;
they showed him photographs

35:22.350 --> 35:24.215
of Prince and his girlfriend,
Sloan Teller.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.717
He I.D.'d the both of them.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.615
Remembered them vividly,
mostly Ms. Teller, vividly.

35:27.650 --> 35:31.450
I haven't even met her,
and I can picture her vividly.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.185
But so what?
The guy has an alibi.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.754
He could've hired anyone
to shoot his wife.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.756
Would you hire someone
to kill someone for you,

35:36.800 --> 35:38.597
go to the trouble
of establishing an alibi,

35:38.630 --> 35:40.723
and then hand that person
your gun to commit the crime?

35:40.770 --> 35:42.931
For the time being, Mr. Prince
has been released from custody.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.665
And until a better theory
presents itself,

35:44.710 --> 35:46.507
I believe we must
continue operating

35:46.540 --> 35:48.633
under our previous assumption
that someone is targeting Prince

35:48.680 --> 35:50.477
in an effort
to undermine The Hound.

35:50.510 --> 35:52.740
I get that framing the head
of a company for murder

35:52.780 --> 35:54.543
could throw a hitch
in his busmess plan,

35:54.580 --> 35:56.514
but it's a hell
of a long way to go.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.211
Precisely the
reason that I think

35:58.250 --> 35:59.945
we need to focus our
attention on an indIVIdual

35:59.990 --> 36:01.514
disposed to going
to such lengths.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.913
Last night, you mentioned

36:02.960 --> 36:04.359
a likely home for
our corporate saboteur,

36:04.390 --> 36:05.652
a company called
Radner Science.

36:05.690 --> 36:07.521
I wasn't even sure
you heard that.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.857
Well, not only
did I hear it,

36:08.900 --> 36:10.595
I spent most of the night
considering it,

36:10.630 --> 36:12.791
and I have concluded
that I agree.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.639
I read the autobiography
of its CEO,

36:14.670 --> 36:16.592
Charles "Call me Chuck"
Hammond,

36:16.640 --> 36:18.403
and he's just the kind
of Sun Tzu-quoting,

36:18.440 --> 36:20.260
take no prisoners
corporate executive

36:20.310 --> 36:23.336
that one might expect to ignore
all boundaries of moral decency.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.972
Plus, the company
is developing a device

36:25.010 --> 36:27.444
in direct competition
to The Hound.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.345
However, from what I can infer
from the Internet,

36:29.380 --> 36:31.780
they may be as much as one year
behind in the race. Come on.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.947
Are you okay?
You seem hyper.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.787
I may have had a coffee or three
with my tea this morning.

36:39.390 --> 36:41.790
Are you joking about this?

36:41.830 --> 36:43.297
Two lives have been taken,

36:43.330 --> 36:44.820
a third is on the
verge of rumation.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.667
It's not really
a joking matter.

36:46.700 --> 36:47.894
You do admit you know

36:47.930 --> 36:49.466
about Hank Prince
and the two murders.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.365
Of course I do.
It's my job to know.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.970
Because your cancer-detecting
products are in competition.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.399
I don't know what sort of
weird cloak and dagger world

36:56.440 --> 36:58.249
you live in, but in mine,

36:58.280 --> 37:00.305
we don't go around
killing our competition.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.739
We don't have to because
there is and always has been

37:02.780 --> 37:04.987
a pretty damn effective
alternative.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.510
And what might that be?

37:06.550 --> 37:07.983
Buying them.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.454
I have a whole floor
full of analysts

37:10.490 --> 37:12.549
whose job is to do nothing more
than pay attention

37:12.590 --> 37:14.455
to start-ups like Hank Prince.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.320
We watch, we wait,
we prepare a bid,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.396
and then when
all this dust settles,

37:18.430 --> 37:19.829
if his device is any good,

37:19.870 --> 37:21.997
we pay him handsomely
for his company.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.339
We put the words Radner Science
on the side of his Hound,

37:25.370 --> 37:27.008
and nobody's happier than me.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.405
Make sense?

37:28.440 --> 37:29.976
Entirely.

37:30.010 --> 37:32.478
Yes, our apologies for
interrupting your breakfast.

37:32.510 --> 37:33.704
You've been most helpful.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.343
(sighs)

37:38.390 --> 37:40.608
Are you crashing?
You look like you're crashing.

37:40.650 --> 37:43.289
No, I'm ascending, actually.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.356
I believe I've determined
who has the strongest motive

37:45.390 --> 37:47.358
to hurt Hank Prince.
VVho?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.893
Hank Prince.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.824
(door opens)

37:53.870 --> 37:55.633
Captain.

37:55.670 --> 37:56.989
Care to explain
why photographs

37:57.040 --> 37:58.905
of my client
and his girlfriend

37:58.940 --> 38:01.636
have been taped
to those chairs?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.636
What's this?
HOLMES: We met Chuck Hammond

38:03.680 --> 38:05.500
this morning.
Colorful chap.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.801
He was kind enough
to give us this.

38:06.850 --> 38:09.410
It's is Radner Science's

38:09.450 --> 38:11.816
financial analysis
of your company,

38:11.850 --> 38:14.387
complete with a handy graph
plotting its projected value

38:14.420 --> 38:15.785
over time.

38:15.820 --> 38:18.380
If The Hound proves
to be as successful

38:18.430 --> 38:21.081
as Barry Granger's research
suggested it would be,

38:21.130 --> 38:23.792
you stand to become
a very wealthy man.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.390
WATSON: Your problem is that you
were in the middle of a divorce.

38:26.430 --> 38:28.068
Your wife's lavwers were busy
trying to figure out

38:28.100 --> 38:29.965
how much you would be worth
in the future

38:30.000 --> 38:32.605
so they would know how much
you would have to share.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.005
You wanted your future
to disappear,

38:34.040 --> 38:35.735
but only temporarily.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.532
HOLMES: You came up
with a tidy plan.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.445
Impersonate Adam Peer
to suggest

38:39.480 --> 38:41.619
that Dr. Granger
falsified his results.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.675
Then murder him,
stage it as a suicide,

38:43.720 --> 38:46.018
simultaneously removing
the one man

38:46.050 --> 38:47.813
who could defend his work

38:47.850 --> 38:50.080
and legitimizing
the accusations of fraud.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.621
Once the divorce
was finalized

38:51.660 --> 38:53.958
and the company
was out of your wife's reach,

38:53.990 --> 38:55.548
well, Barry's work
would be vindicated.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.955
The company's value
would skyrocket,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.366
and you would be able
to keep your millions.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.561
GREGSON: Your company's
value was gonna rebound

39:02.600 --> 39:03.760
too quickly.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.563
You were still dead set
against sharing

39:05.610 --> 39:07.737
anything with your wife,

39:07.770 --> 39:09.374
so you went to plan B--

39:09.410 --> 39:11.105
you killed her.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.608
HOLMES: Realizing that
as the estranged husband,

39:13.650 --> 39:15.709
you would inevitably be
the prime suspect,

39:15.750 --> 39:17.877
you hatched
another devious plan.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.946
You framed yourself for a murder
you actually committed.
The other day,

39:20.990 --> 39:22.617
we told you that we thought
someone was targeting you.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.480
You took that idea
and ran with it.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.622
You murdered your wife

39:25.660 --> 39:26.957
because you thought it fit

39:26.990 --> 39:28.992
with the narrative
of our case.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.590
You were being framed by someone
who wanted to destroy you.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.531
You're forgetting my client
has an alibi for both murders.

39:34.570 --> 39:37.789
You interviewed Sloan Teller
and the cab driver yourselves.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.000
Ms. Teller wouldn't be

39:39.040 --> 39:40.905
the first girlfriend
to falsely alibi

39:42.510 --> 39:44.444
And as far
as the cab driver goes...

39:46.050 --> 39:48.075
This is the actual partition
from the cab in question.

39:48.110 --> 39:49.418
Have a look through it.

39:49.450 --> 39:50.678
Would it surprise you
to learn

39:50.720 --> 39:52.187
that upon being reinterviewed,
the cab driver

39:52.220 --> 39:53.585
admitted that he barely saw

39:53.620 --> 39:54.780
the gentleman in the backseat.

39:54.820 --> 39:56.151
His attention was far more
focused

39:56.190 --> 39:57.851
on the provocatively dressed
Ms. Teller.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.528
As you intended.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.120
We got a warrant
for Ms. Teller's apartment.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.025
Turns out, she spent most
of the day yesterday

40:04.060 --> 40:06.062
on TrueRomantix.com,

40:06.100 --> 40:08.568
specifically searching for guys

40:08.600 --> 40:10.192
about your height,
build and hair color

40:10.240 --> 40:14.028
who might be interested in going
on a date with her last night.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.879
Once we discovered that,

40:15.910 --> 40:18.401
she flipped on you pretty quick.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.918
(phone rings)

40:23.950 --> 40:26.111
Bell.

40:26.150 --> 40:29.119
Hey, man.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.628
Yeah, that was mine.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.497
VVhen?

40:37.730 --> 40:40.563
HAWES: The way it
was described to me,

40:40.600 --> 40:42.090
Mr. Rose walked
up to Mr. Martenz

40:42.140 --> 40:44.028
on Euclid Avenue and...

40:44.070 --> 40:46.231
no warning,
just emptied his weapon.

40:46.270 --> 40:48.135
A couple of Martenz's
friends returned fire.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.172
Both were declared
dead at the scene.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.509
Did you know him?

40:58.690 --> 41:00.885
Only the legend.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.221
*

41:11.570 --> 41:13.561
(laughter, crowd chatter)

41:19.870 --> 41:21.974
And there was me thinking
the party would be inside.

41:22.010 --> 41:23.568
Hey.

41:23.610 --> 41:24.975
I wasn't sure you'd come.

41:25.010 --> 41:27.001
Well, neither was I.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.088
Had I known this would be
the extent of the revelry,

41:32.120 --> 41:33.485
I might have committed
much sooner.

41:36.860 --> 41:39.579
You ever have
one of those nights?

41:40.760 --> 41:42.853
My fair share.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.267
I worked my ass
off to get back,

41:46.300 --> 41:48.768
really back.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.030
Harder than I've worked
at anything my whole life.

41:51.070 --> 41:53.561
Everyone in there

41:53.610 --> 41:56.033
is expecting me to be
happy tonight, but...

41:56.080 --> 41:57.729
Yeah.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.044
The work we do...

42:00.080 --> 42:02.844
There's often a price.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.848
I don't know.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.687
I guess I'm just...

42:06.720 --> 42:09.587
not ready to go inside yet.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.679
Well, don't.

42:12.930 --> 42:15.751
Not yet.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.155
There's a coffee shop
on the corner.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.792
That an invitation?

42:22.340 --> 42:24.968
Well, they'll still be here
when you're ready.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.242
