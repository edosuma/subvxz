00:16.451 --> 00:19.541
A marriage to Julia would be
very good for me, politically.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.933
<i>She's marrying Agrippa.</i>

00:20.933 --> 00:21.934
<i>But he
won't live forever.</i>

00:21.934 --> 00:23.980
And when she does
become available,

00:23.980 --> 00:25.416
I want you to fix it.

00:25.416 --> 00:29.812
Julia has dishonored
her marriage to Agrippa.

00:31.248 --> 00:35.035
It wasn't Vilbia
Julia was sleeping with.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.340
<i>Does it ever bother you</i>

00:36.340 --> 00:38.864
that he adopted my two sons
and never yours?

00:38.864 --> 00:42.085
<i>Love makes us weak.</i>

00:42.085 --> 00:43.869
I saw Gaius's will.

00:43.869 --> 00:47.525
So, the adopted sons of Agrippa
to inherit everything, hmm?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.745
- Who's the executor?
- Domitius.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.399
<i>It was Domitius
behind the famine,</i>

00:51.399 --> 00:52.530
as you suspected.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.272
You still don't believe
she killed my brother?

00:55.272 --> 00:58.623
Revenge on Livia
is your passion, not mine.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.451
- Is that the letter from Mother?
- Yes.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.279
Don't know why she bothered
putting it in code.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.716
Habit, I suppose.

01:04.716 --> 01:07.415
Go get the priestess Aurelia.

01:07.415 --> 01:10.200
I want a copy
of Agrippa's will, too.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.943
I want you to take Germany...

01:13.943 --> 01:15.423
for Rome.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.903
If he ever sees you
as a threat or a problem,

01:17.903 --> 01:19.122
you'll be dead.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.993
You certainly
won't inherit his power.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.473
This is a fucking
enormous honor!

01:22.473 --> 01:23.822
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.737
It's a ten-year suicide note,
is what it is.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.478
I'd be asking yourself
why it's got your name on it.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.306
Something wrong with my head.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.483
<i>Bad Tiberius
lives inside Tiberius.</i>

01:32.483 --> 01:33.789
<i>He always has done.</i>

01:33.789 --> 01:36.661
Tiberius, she's dead.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.228
Mostly, he sleeps but...

01:38.228 --> 01:40.317
- Who wakes him up?
- Mother.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.190
Her poisons.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.540
Yes, she said you were bound
to need them.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.467
Please, enough fighting.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.469
Stop it. Silence.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.340
Please help, please.
Listen, stop it.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.602
- Agrippa.
- Come on, lads,

02:04.602 --> 02:06.038
don't piss your mother off.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.305
Agrippa.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.436
All right,
that's enough.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.003
Stop the bloody carriage!

02:14.003 --> 02:16.310
- Enough of this now!
- I said stop!

02:16.310 --> 02:17.180
Agrippa,
they're fighting again.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.964
Lads, lads, oi!

02:18.964 --> 02:21.228
- Agrippina, enough.
- You were told!

02:21.228 --> 02:22.664
Gaius, you're not
sitting together anymore.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.013
- Agrippa.
- Julilla, get her back.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.014
Agrippa!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.320
Agrippa.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.625
- I saw that!
- The baby's coming.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.061
It's fucking coming!

02:29.061 --> 02:31.107
Can you not just wait
till we get back to Rome?

02:31.107 --> 02:32.674
- What?
- No? Right. Okay.

02:32.674 --> 02:33.979
Yeah, yeah.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.330
Okay. Kids, form up!

02:36.330 --> 02:38.070
Gaius!

02:38.070 --> 02:39.637
Lucius!

02:39.637 --> 02:40.943
Julilla.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.727
Ooh, it's coming now.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.864
Julilla?

02:52.998 --> 02:56.524
I'm coming to get you!

03:02.486 --> 03:05.489
Hmm.

03:05.489 --> 03:09.058
I wonder where she could be.

03:22.854 --> 03:25.074
Found you! I win!

03:27.381 --> 03:29.252
Come on!

03:29.252 --> 03:32.255
Come on, sit down.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.741
I found you.

03:39.741 --> 03:43.701
Oh! I'm knackered.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.182
Out of shape.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.449
Don't worry about your mum.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.103
She's all right.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.800
Women love a good fuss.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.808
You know, my dad...

04:03.808 --> 04:08.987
...would bring us here hunting
when I was your age.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.120
We'd check the traps and then--

04:11.120 --> 04:13.209
then my brother and I,
we'd run off,

04:13.209 --> 04:16.081
throw rocks at birds.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.086
Oh, it was magic.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.614
You know...

04:29.617 --> 04:32.141
I've fought battles and...

04:32.141 --> 04:35.057
sunk fleets and...

04:35.057 --> 04:37.364
built temples and aqueducts.

04:39.844 --> 04:43.195
I don't think I've ever been
as happy as I was then.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.425
Except maybe now.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.789
Fuck, it's coming,
I can feel it!

05:41.384 --> 05:47.738
Daddy?

05:47.738 --> 05:50.915
Wake up, Daddy.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.746
There you are.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.748
Look, it's a boy.

05:57.748 --> 06:02.013
A big, fat boy.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.930
What? What's the matter?

06:15.418 --> 06:18.552
Agrippa?

06:30.433 --> 06:32.522
Oh, my love.

06:40.138 --> 06:44.099
Thank you.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.246
What?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.426
My friend.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.210
My brother.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.001
Senator.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.394
General.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.266
Architect.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.444
Warrior.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.189
As long as...

09:43.800 --> 09:45.802
As long as...

09:45.802 --> 09:49.110
this city stands...

09:49.110 --> 09:51.242
on these hills...

09:55.029 --> 09:57.205
...men will remember the name...

09:58.598 --> 10:03.080
Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.042
Hey. Hey. It's all right.

10:08.042 --> 10:12.350
You don't need him anymore.
You don't need him anymore.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.537
Augustus.

10:25.537 --> 10:29.106
This is the final will
of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa,

10:29.106 --> 10:31.587
held in safekeeping
in the Temple of Vesta.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.070
I wonder what's in it.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.638
You shouldn't joke about that.
Forging wills is sacrilege.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.727
Possibly.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.872
It's brilliant, though.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.701
If you control the temple,
you control the future.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.573
I knew he was leaving
everything to Gaius.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.706
Did you really need
any more money?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.577
Money buys people,

11:05.577 --> 11:08.798
and armies,
you can never have enough.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.147
I'll take my old room.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.062
Put the boys
in Tiberius's old room

11:12.062 --> 11:13.716
and the girls in Drusus's.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.587
The baby can sleep
with the nurse.

11:15.587 --> 11:19.026
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

11:19.026 --> 11:22.246
Have a seat,
darling. Hi, you.

11:22.246 --> 11:26.163
So, Julia, back home
with the parents. How's that?

11:27.469 --> 11:29.427
Still, it's only until they
find you a new husband.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.603
Have they told you
who it is yet?

11:31.603 --> 11:34.084
What? After two marriages
and five children?

11:34.084 --> 11:35.390
No. I'm done.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.609
You're only 27.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.568
You can't seriously imagine
you won't get pimped out again?

11:39.568 --> 11:42.092
Oh, that's hardly
the tone, is it?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.790
What tone would you prefer?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.444
Of course you're welcome
to my husband, such as he is,

11:46.444 --> 11:48.925
but sadly there's no chance
of that happening.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.622
Oh, that is
quite enough of that.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.277
In fact, it's much more
likely to be yours, Antonia.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.064
Why? Have you heard something?

11:57.064 --> 11:59.022
Well, I know Domitius
is interested.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.503
Or then there's Drusus.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.592
- What?
- Or Gallus or Varus.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.072
They'd be worth having
in the Senate.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.595
Or even Tiberius,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.945
now that Vipsania's father
can't vote anymore.

12:08.945 --> 12:12.601
How can you be so callous?

12:12.601 --> 12:14.777
- Plenty of practice.
- Oh, honestly, Marcella,

12:14.777 --> 12:16.083
we're barely into
the mourning period.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.085
Do you have to be
such a fucking bore?

12:18.085 --> 12:21.958
No one gave a slave's ass
about my mourning period.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.656
As soon as Marcella's father
turned to ash,

12:24.656 --> 12:27.790
I was panting away
underneath Antonia's.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.836
I got pregnant so fast

12:29.836 --> 12:32.490
that I wasn't actually sure
whose it was.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.145
- Mother.
- That is my point.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.234
After two husbands,
they left you alone.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.583
And you only had four children.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.630
Yes, but I only had relations
with my husband.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.501
Um, Octavia!

12:45.329 --> 12:47.244
Well, it's a bit late
for self-righteous outrage.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.987
Fuck you, Marcella.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.336
You fucking...

12:52.336 --> 12:53.468
Marcella, stop!

12:53.468 --> 12:55.122
Marcella.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.647
Run, Julilla.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.996
Run for your life.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.868
- Never stop and never look back.
- Get off!

13:01.868 --> 13:03.565
- Stop it!
- It's ridiculous.

13:03.565 --> 13:08.004
Fucking Marcella.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.485
She started taunting Julia
about her next marriage.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.182
What next marriage?

13:12.182 --> 13:14.489
Oh, it's the only thing
anyone wants to talk about.

13:14.489 --> 13:18.319
She said it might
even be one of you two.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.625
Mother's with Piso.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.153
Start packing.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.329
Tell nobody.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.987
I loved Agrippa.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.119
As much as I could.

13:36.119 --> 13:41.124
He was... the balance
between Gaius and me.

13:41.124 --> 13:45.563
His death doesn't
really change the succession.

13:45.563 --> 13:48.088
As far as everyone's concerned,

13:48.088 --> 13:50.612
Augustus's adopted sons
are still first in line

13:50.612 --> 13:52.179
to inherit everything.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.485
But the new will you made
will take care of that,

13:54.485 --> 13:56.574
unless he marries Julia off,

13:56.574 --> 14:00.317
and that really
could complicate everything.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.799
Better he doesn't, for everyone.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.108
But he will.

14:08.108 --> 14:11.154
The choice of husband
will be hugely significant,

14:11.154 --> 14:12.895
politically.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.549
I know.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.899
A mark of particular favor

14:16.899 --> 14:19.510
and influence.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.339
Then it has to be Drusus.

14:28.780 --> 14:33.307
Iullus, I'll leave you to it.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.699
No.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.615
No, what?

14:37.615 --> 14:41.881
No, I can't fix
your marriage to Julia.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.099
Not now. Maybe not ever.

14:43.099 --> 14:47.756
You promised me.

14:49.758 --> 14:54.110
I've done everything you asked.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.938
Gaius will let you run
for the Consul next year,

14:55.938 --> 14:57.113
and I will pay for it.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.941
Everyone's a Consul now.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.856
I want Julia.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.859
You want
the daughter of Augustus.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.079
Why shouldn't I?

15:06.079 --> 15:08.603
I'm sorry.

15:23.444 --> 15:24.967
That's the last time
I'll get betrayed

15:24.967 --> 15:28.840
by your fucking family.
- I doubt that.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.452
My father ruled
the world with yours,

15:31.452 --> 15:33.802
but I'm kept outside
like a fucking leper,

15:33.802 --> 15:37.153
waiting for my turn
as a Consul.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.329
I swear to the gods,

15:39.329 --> 15:43.290
I'll bring this whole
fucking thing crashing down.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
No, you won't.

15:48.991 --> 15:53.039
Livia, you listen to me.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.998
My whole life, I've always done
what everyone else wants.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.305
I've earned my freedom.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.741
Even a slave
gets that in the end.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.351
What?

16:01.351 --> 16:04.180
I don't want to
get married again.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.878
I want to be left alone.

16:06.878 --> 16:10.012
And as some sort of woman,
I expect you to get that

16:10.012 --> 16:12.145
and get behind me.
- Agreed.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.321
What?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.366
I don't want you
to get married again.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.368
It's messy,

16:18.368 --> 16:20.588
and it complicates
everything, so...

16:23.895 --> 16:26.376
All right then. Fine.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.290
So, you'll fix it?

16:32.513 --> 16:34.602
Drusus.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.563
The women are all talking about
who's next for Julia.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.217
If I can't put it off,

16:41.217 --> 16:44.003
it will have to be you.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.484
Will that bother you?

16:50.879 --> 16:52.402
I love Antonina.

16:52.402 --> 16:55.231
But it's just a marriage.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.755
Nobody takes it personally.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.367
What matters
is getting the Republic back,

17:00.367 --> 17:03.892
and if I have to marry Augustus
to do that, then I will.

17:10.768 --> 17:14.772
Prepare your wife.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.906
Domitius will want Julia, too.

17:17.906 --> 17:21.475
You can leave that to me.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.873
Find my sister, please.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.271
And Scribonia,

17:35.271 --> 17:37.534
Livia.

17:45.847 --> 17:49.546
We'll rely on
these measures...

17:49.546 --> 17:50.460
Domitius.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.554
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

17:57.554 --> 18:00.470
Livia.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.994
Are you looking for me?

18:02.994 --> 18:07.347
I want to ask you
to speak to Augustus today.

18:07.347 --> 18:10.001
Tell him that out of respect
for your wife Antonia,

18:10.001 --> 18:13.788
you can't be considered
as husband for Julia.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.660
And why would I do that?

18:16.660 --> 18:20.577
Because it would make me happy.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.927
Well, I hate to make you sad,

18:22.927 --> 18:24.799
but if Augustus

18:24.799 --> 18:26.757
is looking to marry
his daughter to anyone,

18:26.757 --> 18:29.934
then I would expect
to be considered.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.589
And I certainly
wouldn't turn her down.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.330
Hmm.

18:34.330 --> 18:38.291
Domitius.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.683
Was that all?

18:42.643 --> 18:44.645
You know, I never told Augustus

18:44.645 --> 18:46.603
that you organized
that grain famine...

18:49.040 --> 18:53.219
...with your close friend,
Marcus Cassius Elva.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.656
That's where you got the money
to run for Consul.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.788
That's a lie.

18:57.788 --> 19:02.053
My people found
your agent in Egypt,

19:02.053 --> 19:04.447
Tomi, the one
you used to buy the grain,

19:04.447 --> 19:07.058
which you sold to Rome
for six times the price.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.366
Well, he was tortured
until he told us everything.

19:10.366 --> 19:14.849
So, you know...

19:14.849 --> 19:17.678
That's all.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.516
Are you divorcing me for Julia?

19:32.606 --> 19:35.391
If things work out,

19:35.391 --> 19:37.567
I might have to.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.830
Are we still going
to Germany tomorrow?

19:39.830 --> 19:41.397
Of course.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.182
Nothing will happen
till next year.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.931
Oh, well, that's it, then.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.721
Still...

20:00.721 --> 20:06.117
it was fun
while it lasted.

20:06.117 --> 20:10.034
It'll be me
who has to marry Julia.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.558
What?

20:11.558 --> 20:13.690
Stepfather loves Drusus,

20:13.690 --> 20:16.476
because everybody loves Drusus,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.565
but he's jealous of him,
and I think he fears him, too.

20:21.742 --> 20:25.398
He won't give him
his daughter.

20:25.398 --> 20:29.053
He'll give her to someone who--
who he doesn't fear at all,

20:29.053 --> 20:32.753
someone everyone thinks
is useless.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.059
Yes, you're clearly
the most useless choice.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.497
Deep down,
he'll enjoy giving Julia

20:37.497 --> 20:39.803
to the only person in Rome
who doesn't want her.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.762
Because he's a monster.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.330
Plus...

20:44.330 --> 20:47.463
of course you're
irrelevant now, politically,

20:47.463 --> 20:48.682
after your father's death.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.989
Meaningless.

20:51.989 --> 20:55.341
We can't take the baby with us.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.648
He'll slow us down,
and it won't be safe.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.521
Antonina will look after him.

21:11.313 --> 21:16.057
Are you ready then?

21:16.057 --> 21:21.280
I have been ready all my life.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.246
Domitius.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.728
I was just leaving.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.384
He's not well.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.995
I've told him that he should
stop having these meetings,

21:40.995 --> 21:42.953
that it's too tiring,
but he won't listen.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.260
I'm all right.
It's just a chill.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.001
What did Domitius want?

21:47.001 --> 21:50.613
Oh, Domitius said
that he would prefer

21:50.613 --> 21:54.530
not to be considered
if Julia were to remarry.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.140
But he was very nice about it.
I mean, I thought

21:56.140 --> 21:58.055
he was very respectful.
- Mmm.

21:58.055 --> 22:02.886
Listen, Livia,
now that we're all here,

22:02.886 --> 22:04.975
I have a gift for you.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.327
Julia.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.895
She'll have to marry again.

22:11.895 --> 22:15.856
This time I want it
to be into your family.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.814
So...

22:17.814 --> 22:19.860
she'll marry Tiberius.

22:23.211 --> 22:26.214
Tiberius?

22:26.214 --> 22:30.871
And then maybe we can have
grandchildren together, finally.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.134
Oh, thank you.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.745
Yes, thank you.

22:35.745 --> 22:38.226
Well, I--I'm just grateful

22:38.226 --> 22:40.750
that none of my daughters
have to get divorced,

22:40.750 --> 22:42.404
'cause that's
always a bore, isn't it?

22:42.404 --> 22:43.666
They have to come home,

22:43.666 --> 22:46.277
and they just complain
about everything.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.541
I know I'd normally consult you
over something like this,

22:48.541 --> 22:52.588
but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

22:52.588 --> 22:55.243
It certainly was.

22:57.898 --> 23:01.597
Fuck!

23:01.597 --> 23:03.120
Fuck! Fuck!

23:05.906 --> 23:10.040
Someone get Tycho!

23:10.040 --> 23:11.128
Tiberius?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.043
You are fucking kidding me!

23:13.043 --> 23:14.871
- This is a joke.
- Shh. Keep your voice down.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.307
It could be worse.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.701
- Oh?
- You could have got Domitius.

23:18.701 --> 23:21.269
Listen to me,
this is a good thing.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.618
With Tiberius
we can do a deal.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.055
No sex, no children.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.449
That way everything
will come to your boys.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.885
They're the future of Rome.

23:28.885 --> 23:31.497
Fuck Rome! What about my future?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.499
It's just an engagement.
With the mourning period,

23:33.499 --> 23:36.110
you'll get a bit more time
before the wedding.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.940
- Julia...
- No.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.377
- Julia.
- Scribonia, just leave it.

23:50.298 --> 23:53.214
This is not
the worst outcome.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.824
It is for Tiberius.

23:54.824 --> 23:58.306
And Stepfather obviously
doesn't trust me.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.177
If he doesn't trust me now,
then he never will.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.092
Honestly, Drusus,
none of that matters.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.660
We know Augustus wants
Julia's sons

24:04.660 --> 24:07.184
to inherit his power
because they're his blood,

24:07.184 --> 24:11.624
but his will is gonna name <i>you</i>
as his successor.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.323
You forged his will?

24:15.323 --> 24:19.327
We can't have another civil war.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.982
Exactly. And what
was the alternative?

24:21.982 --> 24:24.332
We move now.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.858
I command the Army of the Rhine.

24:28.858 --> 24:31.165
Instead of leading it
into Germany,

24:31.165 --> 24:33.472
I lead it into Rome.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.822
Agrippa's gone,

24:35.822 --> 24:37.040
and Stepfather's
all over the place.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.477
This is the moment.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.479
He'll fight. You know he will.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.178
Not if he's dead,
like Marcellus.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.485
You get the poison.
I'll get the army.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.663
We'll have the Republic back
by the end of the year.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.970
Fuck.

24:53.970 --> 24:58.235
Livia...

24:58.235 --> 25:02.718
Unless, of course,
you're not really serious

25:02.718 --> 25:04.894
about ending his tyranny

25:04.894 --> 25:09.725
or avenging your father?

25:11.945 --> 25:13.773
Answer the question, Livia.

25:17.211 --> 25:20.736
We wait, like we planned.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.216
That way we control
the outcome.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.913
No, you don't.

25:23.913 --> 25:26.002
You think you do,
but you're dreaming.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.527
Life is completely
fucking unpredictable.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.703
You of all people
understand that.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.270
- It's too risky!
- So is waiting!

25:33.270 --> 25:34.489
- Shh.
- Tiberius is gone.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.925
What do you mean, "gone"?

25:35.925 --> 25:38.014
He left Rome with Vipsania
on horseback before dawn.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.235
They left the baby and this.

25:41.235 --> 25:44.673
It's for you.

25:47.937 --> 25:52.028
He's not coming back.
That's what it says.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.422
Find them. Get them back.

25:54.422 --> 25:58.078
Drusus. Drusus, please.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.254
No one else can do this.

26:00.254 --> 26:03.257
Find your brother.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.389
- Gaius will never forgive--
- To be continued.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.055
Antonina.

26:19.055 --> 26:23.277
Livia. Sorry, we're still
packing for Germany.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.584
Germanicus!

26:25.584 --> 26:28.761
Even though that's
obviously been delayed.

26:28.761 --> 26:31.067
So you heard?

26:31.067 --> 26:34.288
Vipsania left me
Drusillus and a note.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.682
Couldn't believe it.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.989
What the fuck does Tiberius
think he's doing?

26:39.989 --> 26:41.730
If my uncle finds out

26:41.730 --> 26:43.340
he's refusing
the marriage to Julia,

26:43.340 --> 26:48.128
he's finished.
Everything is finished.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.999
What do you mean?

26:49.999 --> 26:57.659
I know what it is
you want them to do.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.662
Drusus talks in his sleep.

27:00.662 --> 27:06.146
Things he wouldn't dare say
when he's awake.

27:06.146 --> 27:10.890
At first it didn't make
much sense. Just words...

27:10.890 --> 27:13.370
Fears.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.330
But in the end,
I got it.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.681
Of course
I've never told anyone.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.032
Not even Drusus.

27:23.032 --> 27:27.123
You see, that would be fatal.

27:27.123 --> 27:30.039
Yes, it would.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.520
People sometimes forget,

27:32.520 --> 27:34.827
my uncle killed my father,

27:34.827 --> 27:37.699
indirectly.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.920
Just like he killed yours.

27:43.749 --> 27:48.057
So, we're going
to restore the Republic.

27:48.057 --> 27:53.062
And if you ever need
anything from me,

27:53.062 --> 27:55.064
you can ask.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.687
I love you.

28:13.126 --> 28:18.566
And I need you to watch Drusus.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.916
Do you mean...

28:20.916 --> 28:22.091
spy on my husband?

28:24.877 --> 28:29.838
Yes. That's what I mean.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.666
Got it.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.977
Come on! Come on!

28:37.977 --> 28:39.935
Come on.

28:39.935 --> 28:43.678
You, come in.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.201
Come in.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.029
See? Look.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.248
Come on.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.076
Come in.

28:50.076 --> 28:54.036
All the pleasures of the world.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.691
See?

29:00.303 --> 29:03.263
Welcome, welcome.

29:03.263 --> 29:07.920
Wine for the lady.
Olives and grapes.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.879
Would the lady prefer
to see a man or a woman?

29:13.186 --> 29:16.189
Oh, I don't care, really.

29:21.498 --> 29:25.720
I'm the daughter of Augustus.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.375
And I've never had cunnilingus.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.644
Hello, gods.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.341
Hello, goddesses.

29:38.341 --> 29:41.475
It's me Vipsania Agrippina.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.650
Give me health.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.913
Give me sandals.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.786
And let me escape from Mother.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.919
And in return,

29:50.919 --> 29:53.487
I won't tell anyone
you don't exist.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.755
What is it?

30:00.755 --> 30:03.062
My happy childhood.

30:12.549 --> 30:15.596
Drusus gave this to me
on my eighth birthday.

30:15.596 --> 30:18.729
He stole it from Tycho.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
Where's its head?

30:39.620 --> 30:42.536
<i>Give me
that fucking horse!</i>

30:51.719 --> 30:53.112
What?

30:56.202 --> 30:57.856
My father broke off the head.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.121
Why?

31:05.254 --> 31:06.995
I don't know.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.736
<i>It's wine, Tiberius.
Try this.</i>

31:08.736 --> 31:11.870
Mmm. Here.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.176
Lad, have you
ever seen a clitoris?

31:14.176 --> 31:15.786
Yeah, come here.
Come here and show him.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.658
Sh... Show him your vulva.

31:17.658 --> 31:20.226
<i>For fuck's sake, Nero!</i>

31:20.226 --> 31:22.445
He's only a boy. Ow!

31:22.445 --> 31:24.099
<i>Get off!</i>

31:24.099 --> 31:26.275
You never talk about him.

31:26.275 --> 31:28.887
- Ever.
- Father.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.327
Is this Mother's?

31:35.981 --> 31:38.897
I said, is this Mother's?

32:09.797 --> 32:11.712
Put it on.

32:29.904 --> 32:33.168
It's funny, really,
if you think about it.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.822
Underneath it all,

32:34.822 --> 32:37.520
or even not
underneath any of it,

32:37.520 --> 32:39.958
there's just no difference
between you and me.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.699
Like, "Here you are,
here's a dress,

32:42.699 --> 32:45.180
"a place to crash,
help yourself to the wine,

32:45.180 --> 32:46.355
"he'll be in in a moment,

32:46.355 --> 32:48.967
"and then
someone else after him."

32:48.967 --> 32:51.186
And why is cunnilingus
so taboo anyway?

32:51.186 --> 32:53.275
I'll tell you why,
'cause it's fucking awesome.

32:54.885 --> 32:58.150
Oh, come in,
we're open for business.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.283
Julia.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.894
Gracchus.

33:03.894 --> 33:07.115
Hello. How are you?
How's, um...

33:07.115 --> 33:09.378
...thingy? Your wife.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.641
Julia, what are you doing here?

33:11.641 --> 33:14.035
Well, I'm in mourning.
How about you?

33:16.603 --> 33:18.474
Well, come on then, Gracchus.

33:18.474 --> 33:19.823
Fuck me.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.002
Everyone else has.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.408
Domitius.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.281
Are you waiting for me?

33:46.285 --> 33:48.504
Well, I was just
going to give thanks

33:48.504 --> 33:51.594
for Julia's engagement
to Tiberius.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.640
- Would you care to come?
- Of course not.

33:55.424 --> 33:57.078
Let's say you were right.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.732
Let's say Livia
did have your brother killed.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.430
What?

34:03.650 --> 34:06.348
Have the gods finally
restored your eyesight?

34:06.348 --> 34:11.049
- It was more Livia.
- But it made me wonder.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.615
Do you remember Julia's lover

34:12.615 --> 34:14.443
that everyone was looking for
but never found?

34:14.443 --> 34:16.750
I'm the last fucking person
to forget about that.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.057
Do you think that it was Livia
that had Vilbia set up?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.668
Got Agrippa to kill him?

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
Well, it certainly
wasn't Iullus.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.935
He can barely
wipe his ass with a sponge.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.024
Marcella.

34:36.813 --> 34:40.730
All right.
Here's what I do know.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.645
It was Livia who got
my mother to back off

34:42.645 --> 34:44.169
on Antonina's wedding,

34:44.169 --> 34:47.302
and I also know it was Livia
who uncovered the famine,

34:47.302 --> 34:49.652
back when...

34:49.652 --> 34:52.220
you know, the grain prefects
and the corruption, all that,

34:52.220 --> 34:54.309
which is how that rat Ursa

34:54.309 --> 34:56.572
ended up living with
Livia's new daddy, Piso.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.621
You know, Domitius,

35:01.621 --> 35:04.145
you ought to pay
more attention to women

35:04.145 --> 35:07.322
and slaves and gossip

35:07.322 --> 35:09.324
if you want to know
what's really going on.

35:09.324 --> 35:12.501
If Livia did get Vilbia killed,
that would be

35:12.501 --> 35:15.678
very dangerous for her,

35:15.678 --> 35:18.812
if certain people found out.

35:18.812 --> 35:21.162
Does it matter
if it's true or not?

35:21.162 --> 35:23.947
As long as
certain people think it is.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.124
That would be
an extremely dangerous game.

35:30.389 --> 35:34.654
If you want any kind of power
in this city,

35:34.654 --> 35:39.224
eventually, you'll need
to get rid of Livia.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.117
Drusus will find him.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.735
He wants to see you.

36:21.875 --> 36:25.574
Hey, how are you?

36:29.622 --> 36:33.582
I meant to tell you.

36:33.582 --> 36:38.239
Agrippa's will.

36:38.239 --> 36:42.330
He left you
huge bequests of land.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.681
You're nearly as rich as me now.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.248
Really?

36:47.248 --> 36:50.208
He always loved you.

36:53.602 --> 36:57.345
Did I move too fast with Julia?

36:57.345 --> 36:59.913
It's never good
to let things drift.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.741
It looks weak.

37:01.741 --> 37:02.916
Especially now.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.483
Nobody thinks you're weak.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.879
I'll see Vipsania
and Tiberius today.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.969
Of course,
she'll need a new husband.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.884
What do you think of Gallus?

37:14.884 --> 37:18.801
Oh, there's no need to hurry.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.629
Wait till you're better.

37:20.629 --> 37:23.284
No, we need to be ready.

37:23.284 --> 37:26.374
If anyone's going to move
against us, they'll do it now.

37:26.374 --> 37:30.857
Nobody's going to move
against us.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.970
What are you
doing with the poisons?

37:56.970 --> 38:03.846
- Nothing yet.
- Livia.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.284
Both of my sons
are completely out of control.

38:09.548 --> 38:13.508
The situation's unstable.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.606
<i>Tiberius, wake up.</i>

38:24.606 --> 38:25.955
Wake up.

38:28.131 --> 38:31.091
Livia didn't come today

38:31.091 --> 38:33.006
'cause she doesn't love you.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.355
<i>She never has.</i>

38:34.355 --> 38:37.140
And once upon a time...

38:37.140 --> 38:38.620
<i>She doesn't really love you.</i>

38:38.620 --> 38:41.144
...when you were a tiny baby,

38:41.144 --> 38:43.712
she killed you.
Did I tell you that?

38:43.712 --> 38:45.323
<i>When you were a tiny baby.</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:47.673
She smothered you

38:47.673 --> 38:50.023
with her hands... hands,

38:50.023 --> 38:51.024
until you couldn't
breathe anymore.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.070
<i>Her hands...</i>

38:54.070 --> 38:55.376
And when you were quite dead,

38:55.376 --> 38:56.986
she killed you,

38:56.986 --> 38:58.814
you know what she said then?

38:58.814 --> 39:00.816
<i>She doesn't love you.</i>

39:00.816 --> 39:02.731
It was him...

39:02.731 --> 39:03.689
<i>She killed you.</i>

39:03.689 --> 39:05.125
...or us.

39:07.257 --> 39:10.043
With her hands...

39:10.043 --> 39:11.914
she killed you.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.568
She's a monster. Wake up!

39:20.575 --> 39:22.185
Oh, it's just a dream.

39:22.185 --> 39:26.320
It wasn't a dream.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.583
Ah, I couldn't breathe.

39:28.583 --> 39:32.848
Can you
put some clothes on?

39:32.848 --> 39:34.894
Leave us.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.864
I knew you wouldn't fuck off
to Greece without this rubbish.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.132
These are Mother's.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.134
She was looking for them
for months.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.460
What do you remember
about Father?

40:19.460 --> 40:22.420
Father?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.464
Nothing.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.205
Nothing at all?

40:32.604 --> 40:34.910
I remember his corpse.

40:34.910 --> 40:40.612
Seeing him in the atrium
for people to visit.

40:40.612 --> 40:44.137
Mother took us for cakes
afterwards, to celebrate.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.747
That's all you remember?

40:45.747 --> 40:49.708
They were almond cakes.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.453
- Why?
- I can't go back.

41:09.815 --> 41:11.469
I know.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.514
But you have to.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.515
No, I don't.

41:14.515 --> 41:16.169
Yes, you do.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.780
No, I don't.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.870
One day you'll be free
from all this.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.002
But not now.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.352
Not like this.

41:25.352 --> 41:28.834
Please.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.836
Let me go.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.012
Please.

41:33.012 --> 41:36.494
Look at me.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.974
He'll never forgive you.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.979
It's not safe...

41:43.979 --> 41:45.198
for anyone.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.374
It's not safe for <i>you.</i>

41:47.374 --> 41:49.289
I don't care about me.

41:49.289 --> 41:51.117
I know.

41:51.117 --> 41:57.384
I...

41:57.384 --> 41:59.386
I can't control it.

41:59.386 --> 42:05.827
Myself.

42:05.827 --> 42:07.568
Him.

42:10.876 --> 42:14.227
I can't do this without you.

42:14.227 --> 42:20.929
Oh, I...
I can't breathe.

42:20.929 --> 42:23.323
You can't--
you can't leave me alone.

42:27.719 --> 42:30.765
Tiber, no, no.

42:30.765 --> 42:33.202
No, stop. Stop.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.596
Stop. Stop it.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.250
No. Stop. Stop.

42:37.250 --> 42:40.122
- I'm a monster.
- No. No.

42:40.122 --> 42:41.559
You're not.
You're my brother.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.778
You're my--
you're my brother.

42:50.742 --> 42:51.699
Okay?

43:06.540 --> 43:10.457
Stupid self-confidence.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.590
Mother.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.897
Welcome back.

43:15.897 --> 43:18.552
- Are you fine?
- Yeah.

43:28.344 --> 43:30.303
It wasn't my idea,

43:30.303 --> 43:32.479
the marriage to Julia.

43:32.479 --> 43:36.178
Yes. But you're not sorry,
are you?

43:36.178 --> 43:39.617
Well, no.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.141
Fuck!

43:42.141 --> 43:43.969
What a fuck-up.

43:43.969 --> 43:47.842
Tell me you can fix this.

43:47.842 --> 43:50.323
We need to talk.

43:50.323 --> 43:53.021
Your father's ill.

43:53.021 --> 43:54.849
Brilliant. Serves him right.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.459
Hope he dies screaming.

43:56.459 --> 43:58.766
He wants to see you both.

43:58.766 --> 43:59.767
Now.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.213
Don't make him
choose between us.

44:11.213 --> 44:13.389
He will always choose me.

44:20.788 --> 44:23.878
Oh, Father.
I'm so sorry you're unwell.

44:23.878 --> 44:25.010
I'm fine.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.794
No, he isn't.

44:26.794 --> 44:29.754
You smell like a whorehouse.

44:29.754 --> 44:32.191
It's this new perfume
Marcella bought me.

44:39.415 --> 44:41.200
Your mother told you
about the wedding?

44:41.200 --> 44:44.682
Of course.

44:46.074 --> 44:47.902
Thank you.

44:47.902 --> 44:50.557
It's a great honor.

44:54.387 --> 44:58.565
Yes, and I think Agrippa
would be pleased.

44:58.565 --> 45:01.524
Congratulations, Tiberius.

45:02.787 --> 45:04.702
I'm so happy for you both.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.010
Congratulations, Tiberius.

45:09.010 --> 45:12.013
So sorry for you both.

45:14.581 --> 45:16.104
Stepfather.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.540
We came to say goodbye.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.281
Ah.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.590
Antonina.

45:23.590 --> 45:26.854
Goodbye, Antonina.

45:26.854 --> 45:28.595
We'll be
back for the wedding.

45:28.595 --> 45:30.336
Bring me Germany.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.604
I wouldn't mind if it were you.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.388
Be careful.

45:39.388 --> 45:40.955
Someone else
lives inside Tiberius,

45:40.955 --> 45:42.957
and you don't want to meet him.

45:45.438 --> 45:48.484
I'm so sorry

45:48.484 --> 45:51.879
for your father, Tiberius,
and the divorce.

45:51.879 --> 45:56.405
Yes. I'll be married again
in no time.

45:56.405 --> 45:58.973
I'll let you know who it is
when I find out.

46:11.377 --> 46:14.380
Thank you
for bringing him back.

46:17.296 --> 46:20.081
If you want us to wait, we will.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.823
I'll keep my army
in Germany for now.

46:27.480 --> 46:30.396
I love you, Mother.

46:51.591 --> 46:53.811
Don't go back to Germany.

46:53.811 --> 46:57.989
Please, it's not safe.

46:57.989 --> 46:59.164
That's why
he's keeping you there.

46:59.164 --> 47:01.383
No, he isn't.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.472
You're worrying
about nothing again.

47:03.472 --> 47:05.431
I can't lose you, too.

47:13.004 --> 47:15.528
We need to talk about something.

47:15.528 --> 47:20.315
I'll write.

47:20.315 --> 47:21.882
You never write to anybody.

47:21.882 --> 47:24.842
I'll write to you.

47:54.219 --> 47:56.438
Drusus.

47:56.438 --> 47:59.398
We're ready to move again
when you are.

47:59.398 --> 48:02.009
I need to finish this.

48:02.009 --> 48:04.098
- Fucking code.
- Here.

48:04.098 --> 48:12.106
Let me help.

48:12.106 --> 48:14.456
What's so urgent?

48:14.456 --> 48:16.894
It's just something
I want to get off to Tiberius.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.853
Thank you.

48:19.853 --> 48:22.769
"M"...

48:22.769 --> 48:25.598
One-two.

48:25.598 --> 48:27.426
"O"...

48:27.426 --> 48:31.517
Six-eight.

48:31.517 --> 48:35.869
"T"...

48:35.869 --> 48:38.741
Three-four.

48:38.741 --> 48:43.224
Are you sure this is his code,
and not Mother's?

48:43.224 --> 48:45.096
I'm not a complete idiot.

48:45.096 --> 48:46.532
And it is the latest one?

48:46.532 --> 48:50.318
Uh... fuck.

48:50.318 --> 48:54.801
No, it is the right one.

48:57.282 --> 48:59.414
My brother's hand only.

48:59.414 --> 49:02.287
- And this is for Livia.
- Of course.

49:02.287 --> 49:04.419
Uh, I won't make it
back tonight.

49:04.419 --> 49:07.509
Catch us up when you can.

49:07.509 --> 49:08.989
You--come with me.

49:10.599 --> 49:12.166
Mount up.

49:18.085 --> 49:21.349
<i>Tiberius,
I know you won't agree with me,</i>

49:21.349 --> 49:23.612
<i>and Mother never will.</i>

49:23.612 --> 49:26.964
<i>But now is the time to act.</i>

49:26.964 --> 49:30.141
<i>If I bring my legions to Rome,</i>

49:30.141 --> 49:32.186
<i>and you bring yours
from the Balkans,</i>

49:32.186 --> 49:34.710
<i>Stepfather will have to cede power.</i>

49:34.710 --> 49:38.192
<i>If we act together,
we can restore the Republic</i>

49:38.192 --> 49:40.107
<i>without bloodshed or war.</i>

49:40.107 --> 49:41.630
For Livia,
from Antonina.

49:41.630 --> 49:43.197
<i>But I cannot do it alone.</i>

49:43.197 --> 49:45.721
<i>It will take
both of us together--</i>

49:45.721 --> 49:47.375
<i>an overwhelming show of force.</i>

49:47.375 --> 49:50.074
For Tiberius Nero from Drusus.

49:50.074 --> 49:53.120
<i>Think this over.
Give me your answer.</i>

49:53.120 --> 49:55.514
<i>And don't tell Mother
or Piso.</i>

49:55.514 --> 50:00.519
Impressive,
even by your standards.

50:00.519 --> 50:03.652
Leave us, please.

50:03.652 --> 50:06.873
Antonina, I assume.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.266
Give me the letter.

50:31.245 --> 50:33.943
Write back.

50:33.943 --> 50:35.989
You want me to tell him
I support Stepfather.

50:35.989 --> 50:38.078
What choice do we have?

50:38.078 --> 50:39.514
We could poison Stepfather

50:39.514 --> 50:41.168
and bring out
that will you forged,

50:41.168 --> 50:45.390
naming Drusus as successor.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.568
Or not.

50:53.093 --> 50:54.312
Mother...

50:56.966 --> 51:01.580
...when I was a baby,

51:01.580 --> 51:04.713
did you suffocate me
with your

51:04.713 --> 51:06.715
bare hands until I was dead?

51:14.201 --> 51:17.683
Yes. Why?

51:21.991 --> 51:26.779
Well, I guess that sort of thing
was bound to happen...

51:26.779 --> 51:28.520
sooner or later.

51:32.698 --> 51:34.961
We were on the run.

51:34.961 --> 51:37.355
Bounty hunters found us.

51:37.355 --> 51:41.576
They were all around
in the woods. We were hiding.

51:41.576 --> 51:44.449
And then you started to cry.

51:46.538 --> 51:51.151
- It was me or you.
- I stopped you crying.

51:52.718 --> 51:55.329
When it was safe,
Antigone put you in a stream.

51:55.329 --> 51:57.679
Cold water brought you back.

51:57.679 --> 51:59.942
- I went to the underworld.
- And then you came back.

51:59.942 --> 52:02.293
Someone else came back with me.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.741
I don't believe
in "Bad" Tiberius.

52:18.526 --> 52:21.050
He's just someone Drusus made up
when you were kids.

52:37.328 --> 52:38.894
Now write.

52:40.766 --> 52:43.986
I've betrayed my wife...

52:43.986 --> 52:46.337
and myself.

52:54.345 --> 52:56.390
Now for my brother.

53:11.362 --> 53:13.320
It's an exact copy?

53:13.320 --> 53:16.541
I gave the original letter
to Tiberius.

53:23.243 --> 53:25.419
And the key square?

53:25.419 --> 53:27.508
It's always locked away.

53:27.508 --> 53:30.119
Antonina or his slaves
are always around.

53:36.300 --> 53:40.042
Get it for me.

53:40.042 --> 53:43.916
I can't break the code
without the key.

53:43.916 --> 53:46.223
I-I won't let you down.

54:32.399 --> 54:36.098
Mother said you'd
have to choose between us,

54:36.098 --> 54:38.057
in the end.

54:43.018 --> 54:46.979
Me or Mother.

54:46.979 --> 54:49.286
Mother or me.

54:53.072 --> 54:55.988
She said you'd
always choose her.

55:02.473 --> 55:03.865
She doesn't love you.

55:03.865 --> 55:05.345
<i>She doesn't love you.</i>

55:07.652 --> 55:11.612
- She never has.
- She never has.

55:11.612 --> 55:14.354
- She's a monster.
- She's a monster.

56:04.448 --> 56:05.840
It's you or me,

56:05.840 --> 56:08.190
Mother.

56:10.236 --> 56:12.717
And it isn't me.

56:27.166 --> 56:28.863
Aah!

56:52.496 --> 56:54.454
What have you done?

56:54.454 --> 56:56.543
Come on.

57:12.037 --> 57:16.955
I can't breathe!

57:16.955 --> 57:18.652
I thought I was dead!

57:18.652 --> 57:23.483
I was suffocating!

57:23.483 --> 57:25.572
Oh! It was just a dream.

57:25.572 --> 57:27.661
A nightmare.

57:27.661 --> 57:30.447
It was so real.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.579
Like someone was on top of me.

57:33.841 --> 57:35.669
What are you doing here?

57:35.669 --> 57:39.107
I, I couldn't sleep.

57:39.107 --> 57:42.546
I was in the kitchen.
I heard a noise.

57:46.985 --> 57:48.943
Go back to sleep, yeah.

58:13.228 --> 58:16.667
Domitius, long time
since you were here.

58:16.667 --> 58:18.190
I'm still celebrating
the death of Agrippa.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.670
Won't you join me?

58:22.194 --> 58:24.065
About that...

58:25.545 --> 58:28.722
I just found out.

58:28.722 --> 58:31.551
It wasn't Agrippa
that had your brother killed.

58:33.335 --> 58:36.208
He was set up.

58:36.208 --> 58:40.386
It was Livia.

58:40.386 --> 58:42.475
The wife of Augustus.
