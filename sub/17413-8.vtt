WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.568
Hey, those are for
paying customers only.

00:08.586 --> 00:10.537
I really wish I had the money.

00:10.571 --> 00:12.289
It's for such a good cause.

00:12.340 --> 00:15.292
You're right. Saving the
manatees is a good cause.

00:15.343 --> 00:16.409
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16.427 --> 00:18.578
When I said "good cause,"
I meant my hunger.

00:18.596 --> 00:21.348
I didn't eat breakfast.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.249
I hope my bake sale's a success.

00:23.267 --> 00:26.303
It took me almost four hours
to set up the cupcake tower,

00:26.354 --> 00:28.438
but I finally got
it just perfect.

00:31.609 --> 00:33.426
I baked for days.

00:33.444 --> 00:35.312
There's every kind of cupcake.

00:35.363 --> 00:37.364
Sugar-free, dairy free...

00:37.398 --> 00:39.282
Do you have any that
are just free-free?

00:39.317 --> 00:40.317
I'm really starving.

00:40.368 --> 00:41.702
Fine. I'll let you have one

00:41.736 --> 00:43.487
if you help me with
the bake sale.

00:43.538 --> 00:45.455
You can make sure the table
stays neat and tidy.

00:51.295 --> 00:54.331
I know. We should text Austin
and Dez to help us too.

00:54.382 --> 00:55.582
You sure we can trust them?

00:55.616 --> 00:58.335
They'll probably want
to eat everything.

00:58.386 --> 01:00.253
I doubt they'd put
food in their mouths

01:00.287 --> 01:02.305
if it took money away
from the manatees.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.780
Well, let's get this
bake sale started.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.437
He did it.

02:15.329 --> 02:16.640
Sorry again about
your bake sale.

02:16.664 --> 02:18.364
How much money did you raise?

02:18.382 --> 02:19.532
$5.

02:19.550 --> 02:20.667
Surprisingly,

02:20.701 --> 02:22.469
most people don't
want to buy cupcakes

02:22.503 --> 02:23.587
covered in grass and dirt.

02:25.256 --> 02:28.308
I only sold one.
Thanks again, Dez.

02:28.342 --> 02:29.375
Anytime.

02:29.393 --> 02:31.311
I need more Greens in my diet.

02:32.713 --> 02:36.433
Mmm, grassy.

02:36.484 --> 02:38.384
What am I going to do?

02:38.402 --> 02:39.719
I don't want to spend
another week baking.

02:39.737 --> 02:41.655
We could have a garage sale

02:41.689 --> 02:43.723
and sell all our
ratty, old clothes...

02:43.741 --> 02:45.725
Like this ugly sweater.

02:45.743 --> 02:47.560
Hey, I bought that yesterday.

02:47.578 --> 02:50.497
And you have lovely taste.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.400
We could sell calendars
like firemen do.

02:54.418 --> 02:56.253
I happen to have one right here.

02:56.287 --> 02:58.421
Here's me as a fireman...

03:00.374 --> 03:01.625
As a cowboy...

03:03.577 --> 03:04.628
As a mechanic...

03:06.264 --> 03:09.266
As Austin holding a Teddy bear.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.384
Hey, how'd you get
Sergeant Bearington?

03:11.418 --> 03:14.471
Uh, I didn't tiptoe
into your room

03:14.522 --> 03:17.224
and pry him out of your arms
while you were sleeping

03:17.258 --> 03:19.559
'cause that'd be creepy.

03:19.593 --> 03:22.279
Any other ideas?

03:23.614 --> 03:24.648
I know.

03:24.699 --> 03:26.566
Let's have an auction
at the beach club.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.652
We can sell a bunch of
Austin merchandise.

03:28.703 --> 03:30.476
That's a great idea.

03:30.488 --> 03:32.272
Yeah, we can auction off
autographed posters,

03:32.290 --> 03:33.490
a cd, a guitar.

03:33.541 --> 03:34.708
- You.
- Me.

03:34.742 --> 03:36.493
Wait, what?

03:36.544 --> 03:38.295
We can auction off
a date with you.

03:38.329 --> 03:39.629
Yeah, you're a famous pop star.

03:39.664 --> 03:42.382
Girls love you.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.560
Think of all the money
we could raise.

03:43.584 --> 03:45.502
I'm not sure I'm cool

03:45.553 --> 03:47.287
with a bunch of random
girls bidding on me

03:47.305 --> 03:48.722
like I'm some sort of trophy.

03:48.756 --> 03:51.474
If you're too
uncomfortable, I'll do it.

03:53.344 --> 03:55.345
It's not like it'll
be a real date.

03:55.396 --> 03:57.597
Besides, it'll raise a bunch
of money for my charity

03:57.631 --> 04:00.317
and you do owe Ally for
ruining her bake sale.

04:00.351 --> 04:01.651
You ruined her bake sale too.

04:01.686 --> 04:03.520
Let's not point fingers.

04:03.571 --> 04:05.238
It was him.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.309
Come on, Austin. You do owe me.

04:09.327 --> 04:11.278
All right, I'll do it.

04:11.312 --> 04:13.663
I guess I can go out with a
cute girl for a good cause.

04:13.698 --> 04:16.283
Mm, we don't know if
she's gonna be cute.

04:16.317 --> 04:17.367
She could be an old lady

04:17.418 --> 04:19.252
who smells like prune
juice and kitty litter.

04:19.286 --> 04:20.670
Whoo!

04:20.704 --> 04:23.373
I say we reconsider
Dez's stupid calendar.

04:23.424 --> 04:24.374
Thanks, buddy.

04:24.425 --> 04:26.259
I'm especially proud of October.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:38.439 --> 04:40.473
Do I hear 120?

04:40.507 --> 04:41.507
Sold!

04:41.525 --> 04:43.443
Austin's sweaty gym towel

04:43.477 --> 04:45.362
goes to the girl in red.

04:45.396 --> 04:48.231
We've already
raised over $1,000.

04:48.282 --> 04:49.426
Just think how much
more we'll get

04:49.450 --> 04:50.683
for selling a date with Austin.

04:50.701 --> 04:52.685
Just think. You'd never
even had this fundraiser

04:52.703 --> 04:54.654
if I hadn't ruined
your bake sale.

04:54.688 --> 04:57.240
You're welcome.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.708
I'm not gonna thank you.

04:58.743 --> 05:01.461
Did they auction off Austin yet?

05:02.580 --> 05:05.198
Brooke, what are you doing here?

05:05.216 --> 05:06.583
Winning back my soul mate.

05:06.634 --> 05:08.501
Even though Austin
hasn't returned

05:08.535 --> 05:11.304
any of my 400 texts
or 2,000 emails,

05:11.339 --> 05:13.206
I just know he misses me.

05:13.224 --> 05:14.557
Yeah.

05:14.592 --> 05:15.592
No, he doesn't.

05:17.395 --> 05:20.213
All right. Next
item on our list,

05:20.231 --> 05:21.598
Austin's favorite
stuffed animal,

05:23.434 --> 05:25.385
Sergeant Bearington.

05:25.403 --> 05:31.224
I told you not the sarge.
Okay. Well...

05:31.242 --> 05:33.493
That brings us to our
last item on our list,

05:33.527 --> 05:36.229
a date with the
cute and talented

05:36.247 --> 05:37.664
Austin Moon!

05:41.285 --> 05:44.404
Get your cash ready, ladies.
Do it for the manatees.

05:44.422 --> 05:46.373
Did you know, every year,

05:46.407 --> 05:47.601
the majestic manatees
are threatened...

05:47.625 --> 05:50.260
no one cares! $200!

05:51.412 --> 05:53.263
Okay, I guess we're
starting the bids.

05:53.297 --> 05:57.250
- Brooke?!
- 400, 500, $600!

05:57.268 --> 05:59.469
You know you don't have
to bid against yourself.

06:00.521 --> 06:01.554
Who else wants to bid?

06:01.588 --> 06:03.523
700, do I hear 700?

06:04.608 --> 06:06.276
I see 700.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.311
You just messed with
the wrong girl.

06:08.362 --> 06:10.230
$800.

06:11.365 --> 06:12.482
I got to say, Ally,

06:12.533 --> 06:14.200
I can't believe you're
so cool with this.

06:14.235 --> 06:15.435
I thought you'd be
jealous of Austin

06:15.453 --> 06:16.569
with another girl.

06:16.603 --> 06:18.438
Why would I be jealous?
We're just friends.

06:18.456 --> 06:20.407
Good. Then it's not
gonna bother you

06:20.441 --> 06:22.575
when Austin's future girlfriend
wins a date with him.

06:22.609 --> 06:24.494
What do you mean?

06:24.545 --> 06:26.496
Well, there's a lot of
beautiful girls here.

06:26.547 --> 06:29.416
Just one date and the
rest is history.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.384
It could be that
one or that one.

06:31.419 --> 06:34.220
Meh, not that one, but that one.

06:34.255 --> 06:36.256
I didn't think about that.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.390
I was just trying to save

06:37.425 --> 06:39.309
some stupid endangered animals.

06:39.343 --> 06:42.228
- Ooh.
- $1,000.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.230
Ugh! And Brooke bids

06:44.265 --> 06:47.400
1,000. Do I hear 1,100?

06:47.435 --> 06:49.402
I can't go on another
date with Brooke.

06:50.471 --> 06:51.654
Help me out, Dez.

06:51.689 --> 06:54.240
I got you.

06:54.275 --> 06:56.409
$60.

06:57.578 --> 06:58.661
We're already up to 1,000.

06:58.696 --> 07:00.447
Ooh, sorry.

07:00.481 --> 07:02.499
What can I get for $60?

07:04.668 --> 07:07.170
Congrats, Brooke.

07:07.204 --> 07:08.621
Looks like we have a winner...

07:08.655 --> 07:11.624
And one loser. Sorry, Austin.

07:11.658 --> 07:15.661
Yes! He's gonna be mine...
Forever.

07:17.548 --> 07:20.350
Poor Austin. He has
to go out with a girl

07:20.384 --> 07:22.602
he has no interest
in whatsoever.

07:22.636 --> 07:25.271
Oh darn. Ha ha.

07:25.306 --> 07:27.190
Going once.

07:27.224 --> 07:29.526
- Going twice.
- $3,000.

07:35.682 --> 07:37.567
Brooke, do something.

07:37.618 --> 07:39.319
I don't have that kind of money.

07:39.353 --> 07:40.520
Can I get a loan?

07:40.538 --> 07:43.206
No, but you're gonna be alone.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.542
3,000 to the gorgeous
girl in the back.

07:45.576 --> 07:47.377
Going once.

07:47.411 --> 07:50.696
- Going twice.
- 3,001.

07:50.714 --> 07:53.466
$5,000.

07:56.504 --> 07:59.506
5,000 and... who am I kidding?

07:59.540 --> 08:01.341
I didn't even have the 3,000.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.592
And sold.

08:02.643 --> 08:04.310
A date with Austin Moon

08:04.345 --> 08:06.513
goes to the beautiful girl
with the flawless skin.

08:09.550 --> 08:11.551
Congratulations.
You're very lucky.

08:11.569 --> 08:14.487
- Thank you.
- Oh, I was talking to Austin.

08:15.523 --> 08:16.523
What's up?

08:28.070 --> 08:29.603
Hey, Ally.

08:29.637 --> 08:30.948
Here's the cash from
that beautiful girl

08:30.972 --> 08:32.073
who won a date with Austin.

08:32.107 --> 08:33.908
Her name's Chelsea.

08:33.942 --> 08:36.744
Even her name is beautiful!

08:36.778 --> 08:38.779
Chelsea.

08:38.813 --> 08:40.647
I don't know about beautiful.

08:40.666 --> 08:41.982
I guess she's kind of cute.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.651
Cute? A puppy is cute.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.087
She's stunning.

08:46.121 --> 08:48.005
I mean, did you see her skin?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.991
It's flawless like
a polished pearl.

08:52.678 --> 08:54.795
Okay, she's beautiful.

08:54.829 --> 08:56.830
I just wish everyone would
stop bringing it up.

08:56.848 --> 08:58.665
Hey, uh, did anyone else notice

08:58.684 --> 09:01.018
how beautiful Chelsea is?

09:01.053 --> 09:02.837
Her skin is flawless

09:02.871 --> 09:05.005
like a polished pearl...

09:05.023 --> 09:07.692
In a fresh vat of cream cheese.

09:07.726 --> 09:09.777
I get it.

09:09.811 --> 09:10.844
She has good skin.

09:10.862 --> 09:12.947
Oh-ho, jealous much?

09:12.981 --> 09:15.032
I'm not jealous.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.985
I just get this weird
burning feeling in my chest

09:18.019 --> 09:20.654
when I think about Austin
with another girl.

09:20.688 --> 09:22.707
Yeah, that's jealousy.

09:22.741 --> 09:24.575
Or heartburn.

09:24.626 --> 09:25.770
Did you have spicy
food for lunch?

09:25.794 --> 09:28.662
'Cause I did.

09:28.696 --> 09:31.882
You know, it's okay to
be bothered by all this.

09:31.917 --> 09:34.668
It's not easy seeing the guy
you like with someone else.

09:34.702 --> 09:37.004
Okay, I admit I'm a little upset

09:37.038 --> 09:38.973
Austin's going out with Chelsea.

09:39.007 --> 09:41.685
I'm starting to regret I set up this
whole auction thing in the first place.

09:41.709 --> 09:45.045
Look, just because
she's totally gorgeous

09:45.063 --> 09:47.815
and Austin's the most
lovable person on earth

09:47.849 --> 09:49.900
doesn't mean they're
gonna hit it off.

09:49.935 --> 09:51.902
Yeah. Hopefully,

09:51.937 --> 09:53.053
they'll just go on
some lame date,

09:53.071 --> 09:54.905
and Austin will be
bored out of his mind.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.890
Oh, he won't be bored.

09:56.908 --> 09:57.891
Chelsea's taking Austin

09:57.909 --> 09:59.610
to salsa night at
the beach club.

09:59.661 --> 10:02.663
Aw, how romantic... the
lights, the music,

10:02.697 --> 10:04.749
the dancing under the starts.

10:04.783 --> 10:06.083
There goes that heartburn again.

10:16.678 --> 10:18.106
I'm so glad you invited
me dancing, Ally.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.847
I love to salsa.

10:19.881 --> 10:22.916
I've been told I have Irish
eyes and Latin hips.

10:22.934 --> 10:24.885
Yeah, yeah. Stop talking.

10:24.919 --> 10:26.637
I'm trying to listen
to Austin and Chelsea.

10:26.688 --> 10:27.855
You should watch 'em too.

10:27.889 --> 10:28.899
Maybe you'd learn something

10:28.923 --> 10:30.724
'cause you are one bad dancer.

10:30.758 --> 10:32.643
Ow! See?

10:32.694 --> 10:33.871
You accidentally
stepped on my foot.

10:33.895 --> 10:36.647
Yeah, accidentally.

10:39.701 --> 10:40.818
Spin me closer to them.

10:40.869 --> 10:41.879
I want to hear what
they're laughing about.

10:41.903 --> 10:42.903
You got it.

10:47.909 --> 10:49.794
Sorry, Trish.

10:49.828 --> 10:50.944
That's okay.

10:50.962 --> 10:52.713
I would've dropped them anyway.

11:07.646 --> 11:09.206
Dez, do something.
They're walking away.

11:09.898 --> 11:10.964
All right, you got it.

11:15.987 --> 11:18.689
Whoa, are you okay? Here,
let me help you up.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.808
Thanks... can get up by myself.

11:21.827 --> 11:23.027
I'm fine too.

11:23.078 --> 11:24.912
I can take a hit.

11:24.946 --> 11:26.831
I play football
with my brothers.

11:26.865 --> 11:30.751
Wow, you're a good dancer
and you play football.

11:30.785 --> 11:32.703
Isn't she great, Ally?

11:32.754 --> 11:35.656
Yup, greaty-great-great.

11:35.674 --> 11:38.825
Wow, you really do
have flawless skin.

11:38.844 --> 11:42.129
Me? Look at you.
You're so pretty.

11:44.999 --> 11:47.000
Ugh! She's nice too.

11:47.018 --> 11:48.802
I really wanted to hate her.

11:51.773 --> 11:52.773
Hey, Dez.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.808
Where's Austin and that girl?

11:54.842 --> 11:56.694
Uh, I don't know.

11:56.728 --> 11:57.778
What are you doing here?

11:57.812 --> 11:59.980
Not spying on Austin
and that girl!

12:00.014 --> 12:01.615
Why would you say that?

12:01.650 --> 12:03.734
Uh, I didn't say that.

12:03.785 --> 12:05.096
You want to dance with
me till they get back?

12:05.120 --> 12:07.738
- Ooh, sorry, Brooke...
- Dance with me!

12:09.658 --> 12:10.958
I'm with Ally.

12:10.992 --> 12:12.793
Fine!

12:13.861 --> 12:15.913
You don't need a partner
to salsa dance.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.671
I don't know about you guys,

12:23.705 --> 12:25.015
but I'm glad this
night is almost over.

12:25.039 --> 12:26.924
My feet are killing me.

12:26.975 --> 12:28.809
Try dancing with Ally.

12:28.843 --> 12:31.095
She even managed to step
on my hand somehow.

12:31.146 --> 12:34.848
I'm sorry, Dez. I'll
make it up to you.

12:34.882 --> 12:36.984
I'll buy one of your
ridiculous calendars.

12:37.018 --> 12:38.819
You'll have to wait for
the next printing.

12:38.853 --> 12:39.987
I sold out tonight.

12:43.992 --> 12:46.694
Seriously? Why are
all these old ladies

12:46.728 --> 12:47.861
buying your calendar?

12:47.895 --> 12:50.030
They may or may not
think I'm prince Harry

12:50.064 --> 12:52.116
because I may or may not
have told them I am.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.868
Cheerio, me ladies.

12:54.902 --> 12:57.671
That's British for "'sup?"

13:01.843 --> 13:03.076
I'm sorry you had to see Austin

13:03.094 --> 13:04.745
with another girl, Ally.

13:04.763 --> 13:07.715
It's okay. Tonight wasn't
as bad as I thought.

13:07.749 --> 13:08.993
Maybe I was worried for nothing.

13:09.017 --> 13:10.995
Actually, I heard they're
making plans for another date.

13:11.019 --> 13:13.754
Oh, good. So I was
worried for something.

13:20.812 --> 13:22.730
And she recycles?!

13:22.764 --> 13:24.815
There's just no
hating that girl.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.718
Look, I know you're upset
about Austin and Chelsea.

13:32.753 --> 13:34.787
There's only one way
to get over this.

13:34.805 --> 13:37.556
You need to start thinking
about other guys,

13:37.591 --> 13:39.392
guys who have cool jobs.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.343
Like a pilot.

13:42.679 --> 13:45.648
I'm not buying your
stupid calendar.

13:45.682 --> 13:47.650
So I got more details

13:47.684 --> 13:49.485
about Austin's second
date with Chelsea.

13:49.519 --> 13:50.653
What are they doing?

13:50.687 --> 13:52.405
Chelsea's renting
out the beach club

13:52.439 --> 13:53.773
for a fairy tale themed date.

13:53.807 --> 13:56.575
There'll be princess costumes,

13:56.610 --> 13:58.577
waitresses dressed
as court jesters.

13:58.612 --> 13:59.779
It's bad news, Ally.

13:59.813 --> 14:02.314
Ugh, I know. She's pulling
out all the stops

14:02.332 --> 14:04.700
to impress Austin.

14:04.751 --> 14:06.652
I don't want to be I
meant a court Jester..

14:06.670 --> 14:08.370
I'm not good at
making people laugh.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.428
I think you're
pretty good at it.

14:15.462 --> 14:18.547
Well, I think the whole idea

14:18.598 --> 14:20.433
of a fairy tale
date sounds corny.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.550
I think it's magical.

14:21.601 --> 14:22.768
She's the beautiful princess.

14:22.803 --> 14:24.503
Austin's the handsome prince.

14:24.521 --> 14:27.440
Like all fairy tales, they'll
probably fall madly in love

14:27.474 --> 14:29.358
and live happily ever after.

14:29.392 --> 14:32.361
Not all fairy tales
have happy endings.

14:32.395 --> 14:33.646
Name one.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.347
Um...

14:35.365 --> 14:37.399
The one where the girl
with the flawless skin

14:37.451 --> 14:38.517
meets the handsome singer

14:38.535 --> 14:39.712
and they have a
terrible second date

14:39.736 --> 14:41.353
and go their separate ways.

14:41.371 --> 14:42.521
Huh.

14:42.539 --> 14:43.739
My mom never told me that one.

14:50.797 --> 14:53.549
Thanks again for
agreeing to perform

14:53.583 --> 14:55.534
at my little sister's
birthday party.

14:55.552 --> 14:56.635
It's the least I could do

14:56.670 --> 14:58.370
after you donated so much money

14:58.388 --> 15:00.556
for Ally's charity.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.558
This prince crown's a
little small for me.

15:02.592 --> 15:05.311
That's because it's
my princess tiara.

15:07.430 --> 15:08.624
By the way, it was
cool of your boyfriend

15:08.648 --> 15:09.692
to let me take you dancing.

15:09.716 --> 15:11.567
Oh, he's a big supporter
of the manatees

15:11.601 --> 15:12.735
like Ally.

15:12.769 --> 15:14.603
So is she okay
with our date too?

15:14.654 --> 15:16.689
Of course. We're just friends.

15:16.723 --> 15:18.524
She's totally cool with it.

15:18.558 --> 15:20.576
I'm totally not cool with this.

15:20.610 --> 15:23.529
I am totally not cool in this.

15:23.563 --> 15:25.498
I think you look great.

15:25.532 --> 15:27.333
Why are you wearing a costume?

15:27.367 --> 15:28.511
You're not working this party.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.703
What costume?

15:30.737 --> 15:32.705
Chelsea's really pulling
out all the stops.

15:32.739 --> 15:34.290
It must have been a ton of work

15:34.341 --> 15:35.424
to decorate this place.

15:36.543 --> 15:39.428
Whoa! A unicorn.

15:39.462 --> 15:41.463
I've never seen one
up close before.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.750
And you still haven't.

15:44.768 --> 15:47.303
That's a pony with a
horn taped to its head.

15:47.354 --> 15:49.421
Way to kill the magic, Ally.

15:50.590 --> 15:52.725
I hope my sister
likes her present.

15:52.759 --> 15:55.394
- Oh.
- Oh.

15:55.428 --> 15:57.646
She's gonna love it.

15:57.697 --> 15:58.791
You have got to be kidding me.

15:58.815 --> 16:01.266
I've got to talk to him now.

16:01.284 --> 16:02.284
Back off, Ally!

16:03.320 --> 16:05.404
You're not destroying this date.

16:05.438 --> 16:06.405
I am!

16:06.439 --> 16:07.706
What? I'm not destroying...

16:07.741 --> 16:10.376
- out of my way!
- Wait, no, no.

16:21.338 --> 16:26.342
Those evil witches ruined
my princess party.

16:26.393 --> 16:29.595
I am not an evil witch.
I'm a good witch.

16:29.629 --> 16:31.480
Wait, I'm not a witch at all.

16:31.514 --> 16:33.298
Wait, did you say
princess party?

16:33.316 --> 16:35.300
Yes, this is a birthday party

16:35.318 --> 16:36.468
for my little sister, Heidi.

16:36.486 --> 16:37.636
What did you think it was?

16:37.654 --> 16:39.355
Uh...

16:39.406 --> 16:40.716
Not your second
date with Chelsea,

16:40.740 --> 16:42.474
that's for sure.

16:42.492 --> 16:44.693
Date? I was just
doing her a favor

16:44.744 --> 16:47.329
because she donated so much
money to your charity.

16:47.364 --> 16:48.747
Besides, she has a boyfriend.

16:48.782 --> 16:51.617
Uh, duh! Of course she does.

16:51.651 --> 16:55.621
She's pretty. She's nice.
Did you know she recycles?

16:55.655 --> 16:57.706
Ally, why did you ruin

16:57.757 --> 16:59.658
my little sister's
birthday party?

16:59.676 --> 17:01.427
Yeah.

17:01.461 --> 17:03.379
I didn't mean to.

17:03.430 --> 17:05.598
I'm so sorry, Heidi.

17:05.632 --> 17:08.500
I can't believe you
destroyed the dreams

17:08.518 --> 17:10.352
of this sweet little girl.

17:10.387 --> 17:11.720
I'm so sad.

17:11.771 --> 17:14.473
Can you make me laugh, Jester?

17:14.507 --> 17:16.275
I don't feel that bad, kid.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.728
Since we're all apologizing
for ruining parties,

17:19.779 --> 17:22.564
Brooke, do you have something
you want to say to Heidi?

17:22.616 --> 17:24.683
Yes.

17:27.621 --> 17:30.372
Fairy tale wishes do come true.

17:30.407 --> 17:32.291
Austin's still single.

17:32.325 --> 17:33.742
I'll text you later, baby.

17:33.793 --> 17:35.527
Whoo!

17:35.545 --> 17:37.496
No, she won't.

17:37.530 --> 17:38.664
I changed my number.

17:38.698 --> 17:41.533
Don't worry, buddy. I
gave her your new one.

17:56.399 --> 17:58.350
Again! Again!

17:58.384 --> 18:01.520
Think of the money, Trish.
Think of the money.

18:08.611 --> 18:10.729
You could have just
told me you were upset.

18:10.747 --> 18:12.414
I wouldn't have
gone on that date

18:12.449 --> 18:13.565
if I knew it would bother you.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.501
I thought I'd be okay with it.

18:15.535 --> 18:17.536
But seeing you with someone else

18:17.570 --> 18:19.338
really made me jealous.

18:19.372 --> 18:20.405
It's stupid.

18:20.423 --> 18:22.675
No, it's not.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.409
I get it.

18:24.427 --> 18:25.744
I'd be jealous too.

18:25.762 --> 18:27.463
Really?

18:27.514 --> 18:29.298
Yeah.

18:29.349 --> 18:31.300
But what are we supposed to do?

18:31.351 --> 18:33.352
Remember last time
we tried to date?

18:33.386 --> 18:34.753
It didn't work out.

18:34.771 --> 18:37.556
I know. We couldn't
even write songs.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.358
It threw everything off.

18:41.528 --> 18:42.761
Well, if we're not
gonna be together,

18:42.779 --> 18:44.396
it's only a matter of time

18:44.430 --> 18:46.281
before one of us
meets someone else.

18:46.316 --> 18:49.368
You think it's time

18:49.402 --> 18:51.770
for us to move on and
date other people?

18:53.773 --> 18:55.574
Maybe.

18:55.608 --> 18:57.710
Whatever happens,

18:57.744 --> 18:59.294
I just want you to be happy.

18:59.329 --> 19:02.464
I want you to be happy too.

19:06.619 --> 19:07.669
So you cool if I go sing

19:07.721 --> 19:09.621
to that little
princess over there?

19:09.639 --> 19:12.591
Sure. I'll start looking for
my knight in shining armor.

19:14.427 --> 19:15.644
Oh, there he is.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.467
This song is dedicated to Heidi.

19:22.485 --> 19:24.302
Sorry your birthday
got messed up,

19:24.320 --> 19:25.447
but hopefully this
makes it better.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.322
