not on silent mode,

01:21.780 --> 01:24.551
but good, old-fashioned off.

01:56.882 --> 02:00.587
I was saying that I've never seen
you, uh, outside of school.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.220
So, it's Luke.

02:04.222 --> 02:05.492
We're in the same class.

02:06.257 --> 02:07.759
Yeah, I know who you are.

02:08.894 --> 02:11.294
Oh, 'cause... No, it was...

02:11.296 --> 02:13.800

03:56.801 --> 03:57.936
Hey!

04:05.610 --> 04:07.610
You have a nice voice.

04:07.612 --> 04:08.811
Thanks.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.847
And this song,
you write yourself?

04:11.849 --> 04:12.918
No.

04:13.919 --> 04:17.853
You know, my daughter,
she likes this music too.

04:17.855 --> 04:19.725
These kind of sad songs.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.795
- I'm late for the bus.
- Hey, I have truck here.

04:24.862 --> 04:26.665
- I can take you...
- The bus is fine.

04:40.012 --> 04:41.381
Oi, oi!

04:43.548 --> 04:44.981
Oi, you!

04:44.983 --> 04:46.319
Boys!

04:50.055 --> 04:51.658
Don't go away!

04:52.925 --> 04:54.123
Oi, you!

04:57.528 --> 04:58.798
How old are you?

05:00.999 --> 05:02.031
Twenty-one.

05:02.033 --> 05:04.971
Oh. You look younger.

05:06.504 --> 05:07.874
I get that a lot.

05:14.879 --> 05:19.485
Back in Croatia
I was singer to opera.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.455
You like opera?

05:24.122 --> 05:25.522
Here's fine.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.093
Thanks for the ride.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.364
Hey, I'm Vlad.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.098
Nice to meet you.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.969
<i>Everyone is signing up.</i>

08:26.971 --> 08:30.106
Even that guy with the weirdly high voice.
I thought it was a joke.

08:30.108 --> 08:32.174
And then in chemistry I asked him
again, and he was like,

08:32.177 --> 08:35.078
"I have a better
singing voice than you."

08:36.715 --> 08:37.884
You're signing up then?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.116
Yeah, 'course. With Hayley and Kelli.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.085
- When is it?
- Saturday.

08:43.087 --> 08:46.055
My boyfriend's gonna drive us.
He has a BMW.

08:46.057 --> 08:47.156
It's really old.

08:47.158 --> 08:48.657
It's still a BMW.

08:48.659 --> 08:49.694
Hmm...

08:50.328 --> 08:52.097
Are you trying out,
Violet?

08:52.831 --> 08:54.834

Okay, guys,
guys, quiet, please.

10:52.149 --> 10:55.084
Everybody, please, this way,
thank you very much.

10:55.086 --> 10:56.820
Uh, sorry about that.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.155
Um, it's just the better
that you guys listen now,

10:59.157 --> 11:02.057
the quicker we can
get through with this, okay?

11:02.059 --> 11:05.195
So, today
you will be adjudicating.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.162
No, you won't,
'cause that's my job.

11:07.164 --> 11:10.233
You will be adjudicated, should I say,

11:10.235 --> 11:13.969
on your vocal and dance abilities.

11:13.971 --> 11:16.473
Don't worry, it's still
a singing competition.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.974
I saw a few faces go then.

11:18.976 --> 11:22.112
As you well know, it's the first
time we've come to the island.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.314
So it's really just a chance
for you guys

11:24.316 --> 11:26.782
to show us what we've been
missing all this time, yeah?

11:26.784 --> 11:30.487
Ultimately, only five of you
will be invited back tomorrow

11:30.489 --> 11:32.988
to perform for Jules
and the show's producers.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.124
Okay, any questions,

11:35.126 --> 11:37.127
please do speak to your team leaders.
That's what they're here for.

11:37.129 --> 11:40.262
And other than that, good luck.
Break a leg.

11:45.803 --> 11:47.903
- I know!
- Oh, my gosh.

11:47.905 --> 11:50.141
It's like ten girls in one bathroom.
I'm like, "Hello."

12:29.214 --> 12:31.147
Good! Let's start again.

12:31.149 --> 12:34.153
Five, six, energy! Hit it!

13:45.956 --> 13:48.126
Thanks.

13:54.499 --> 13:58.066
This is for you. You need to bring
it when you come back tomorrow.

13:58.068 --> 13:59.237
Tomorrow?

13:59.671 --> 14:01.371
Yeah.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.440
Today's the audition
for the audition, so to speak.

14:04.442 --> 14:07.046
There's another two stages
before the final round.

14:08.312 --> 14:11.216
So, um, fill that in for me,
we can send you on your way.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.117
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.386
You need to bring a parent or
guardian when you come back.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.054
It's company policy.

14:18.056 --> 14:19.421
Is there a way around that?

14:19.423 --> 14:21.291
I don't make the rules, love.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.095
9:15 tomorrow.

14:24.261 --> 14:25.630
Don't forget your pass.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.272
You're too late.

14:37.274 --> 14:38.443

Teen Spirit were holding
open-call auditions today in Ryde.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.425
I got asked to come back.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.629
It's a singing competition.

15:31.596 --> 15:32.998
And what?

15:34.298 --> 15:35.732
I need someone to come with me.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.170
You'll be fine, yeah.

15:39.037 --> 15:41.006
No, they said I need a guardian.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.709
I lied to you
about how old I am.

15:44.775 --> 15:46.611
I remember
you said you liked my singing.

15:48.446 --> 15:50.249
There's not much
I could give you.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.515
I have my iPod.

15:52.517 --> 15:55.283
It's not really new or
anything, but it still plays...

15:55.285 --> 15:58.153
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep your iPod.

15:58.155 --> 16:01.225
I'll tell you what,
this, uh, Top Teen...

16:02.192 --> 16:03.126
Teen Spirit.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.094
Okay, Teen Spirit.

16:05.096 --> 16:07.095
Is there any reward involved?

16:07.097 --> 16:08.464
Prize money or...

16:08.466 --> 16:10.565
Some people get record
contracts and stuff.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.667
But only if you
win in the finals.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.374
Hey.

16:19.376 --> 16:23.579
If I come with you,
and you make it big,

16:23.581 --> 16:26.248
I have to be your manager.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.517
I don't need a manager,
it's just an audition.

16:28.519 --> 16:31.387
I said, "If you make it big."

16:31.389 --> 16:33.723
I will split everything 50-50.

16:33.725 --> 16:35.690
You take 50 percent?

16:35.692 --> 16:37.062
Yeah.

16:38.462 --> 16:40.298
Just pick me up at 8:00.

17:03.354 --> 17:04.423
Yeah.

17:20.538 --> 17:21.707
Liquid courage?

17:22.574 --> 17:25.044
Nope. Okay. Hop in.

17:33.183 --> 17:34.353
Vlad.

17:38.623 --> 17:42.326
Hi, Violet Valenski.
I have a guardian.

17:44.429 --> 17:46.129
This is your guardian?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.363
Yeah, he's my uncle.

17:47.365 --> 17:48.663
Um...

17:48.665 --> 17:51.467
You sign here
and print your name.

17:51.469 --> 17:52.770
Mm-hmm.

17:58.276 --> 17:59.408
Vladimir Brajkovic?

17:59.410 --> 18:00.509
Yeah.

18:07.652 --> 18:11.586
My parents are huge fans of the
opera and they love your uncle.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.578
Uh, Miss Valenski?

18:35.579 --> 18:36.778
Wish me luck.

18:36.780 --> 18:39.250
Luck has nothing
to do with anything.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.253
Did you bring
your own music with you?

18:44.255 --> 18:46.622
Yeah, I have an iPod.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.623
Right, just one thing,
so you know,

18:48.625 --> 18:51.594
Jules might cut you off,
ask for something else.

18:51.596 --> 18:53.496
'Cause you prepared
a couple of songs, yeah?

18:53.498 --> 18:55.430
- Yeah.
- It's not personal.

18:55.432 --> 18:57.336
She does it to everyone, so...

18:57.935 --> 18:59.535
don't overthink it.

18:59.537 --> 19:00.706
All right.

19:17.922 --> 19:19.822

19:28.398 --> 19:29.934

19:31.301 --> 19:32.334
Polish.

19:32.336 --> 19:33.504

22:04.721 --> 22:08.426
You should have chosen a
song with a more versatile range.

22:10.728 --> 22:12.694
I can sing something else.

22:12.696 --> 22:14.965
Mm. But you have a nice voice.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.767
Thanks.

22:18.769 --> 22:20.605
You need to work
on everything else.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.006
Yeah.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.347
Do you have someone with you?

22:28.980 --> 22:30.011
I do.

22:30.013 --> 22:31.415
Bring them on, please.

22:42.859 --> 22:44.362
Are you the dad?

22:45.496 --> 22:47.032
Manager.

22:48.499 --> 22:50.199
We were telling Violet
that she has potential,

22:50.201 --> 22:52.968
but she has to work
on her performance skills.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.538
Potential for what?

22:55.605 --> 22:57.672
What potential?

22:57.674 --> 23:00.111
We're going to invite
Violet to remain in the competition.

23:01.778 --> 23:04.680
So she wins something,
or what?

23:04.682 --> 23:05.881
No.

23:05.883 --> 23:07.516
She's through
to the next round.

23:07.518 --> 23:08.984
She needs to practice.

23:08.986 --> 23:10.553
Work on her breathing.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.957
She's very green.

23:13.557 --> 23:17.628
I will make sure
that she is ready.

23:18.095 --> 23:19.765
Okay, thank you!

23:21.766 --> 23:24.870
Yeah, if you both wanna follow
me, we'll get you sorted.

23:26.471 --> 23:29.238
Hey, do we get
any money for today? Or...

23:29.240 --> 23:32.076
Uh, you're a little
bit of a way off that yet.

23:35.246 --> 23:37.048
- See you guys Saturday.
- See you.

23:38.082 --> 23:40.048
- What?
- Mother's gonna lose her shit.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.116
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

23:42.118 --> 23:43.751
You're not meeting
my mum.

23:43.753 --> 23:45.019
Hey, trust me.

23:45.021 --> 23:46.625
I'm good with people.

23:47.124 --> 23:48.492
Too good.

24:01.638 --> 24:02.938
So...

24:02.940 --> 24:04.942
what are your intentions
with my daughter?

24:06.076 --> 24:08.576
- I think...
- Vlad's helping me with my singing.

24:08.578 --> 24:09.815
Helping? How?

24:11.249 --> 24:13.082
I went to an audition today.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.284
For a singing competition.

24:15.286 --> 24:18.019
And I qualified for the next round.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.823
If I go through,
I get to go to London.

24:20.825 --> 24:22.824
It would be on television.

24:22.826 --> 24:24.095
You like television.

24:25.229 --> 24:27.529
It could be a good thing
for the both of us.

24:27.531 --> 24:29.634
What does he have
to do with all this?

24:30.166 --> 24:31.866
I'm her manager.

24:31.868 --> 24:33.235
What are you talking about?

24:33.237 --> 24:35.240
Manager?
Manager for what?

24:52.056 --> 24:55.190
Tell her I was an opera singer.

24:55.192 --> 24:56.460
I already did.
She doesn't care.

24:58.261 --> 25:01.263
How are you going to do this and
keep up with your responsibilities?

25:01.265 --> 25:02.931
School's out next week.

25:02.933 --> 25:04.903
I can still work
nights and weekends.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.646
We don't
have money to pay you.

25:18.648 --> 25:21.283
So what are you
getting out of this?

25:21.285 --> 25:25.120
She does well in this competition,
maybe she has a future.

25:25.122 --> 25:27.323
And I get 50 percent, yeah?

25:27.325 --> 25:28.990
Fifty percent?

25:28.992 --> 25:30.926
You get 15 percent.

25:30.928 --> 25:32.294
That's what manager gets.

25:32.296 --> 25:35.698
Not a penny more.
And no monkey business.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.633
You lay a finger on my daughter
and I will have you killed.

25:38.635 --> 25:40.739
I know people
who can do terrible things.

25:43.907 --> 25:45.373
Understood.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.744
Are you sure?

25:48.211 --> 25:49.881
Sure.

25:53.351 --> 25:54.819
It was nice meeting you.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.790
Thank you for bringing
my daughter home safely.

26:02.792 --> 26:03.994
Nice to meet you.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.237
Thank you for today.

26:15.239 --> 26:16.775
You know...

26:17.741 --> 26:19.743
your mother is very beautiful.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.112
I'll tell her you think so.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.216
Don't laugh. It's true.

26:28.818 --> 26:31.322
- Vlad.
- Yes, Violet?

26:32.390 --> 26:33.892
Were you really an opera singer?

26:35.393 --> 26:37.127
Once upon a time.

26:51.307 --> 26:52.874
Oi, come on, don't be shy.

26:52.876 --> 26:56.280
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh!

27:02.952 --> 27:04.888
Yo, Lisa told me the good news.

27:06.022 --> 27:07.692
Congratulations. That's...

27:08.759 --> 27:10.324
That's rather brilliant.
That's really good.

27:10.326 --> 27:11.663
Thanks.

27:14.365 --> 27:17.699
Yo, my band's playing a g...
a gig on, um...

27:17.701 --> 27:19.267
It's on Saturday.

27:19.269 --> 27:21.870
But we're...
we're pretty shit. But...

27:21.872 --> 27:24.405
I think you...
You'd probably...

27:24.407 --> 27:26.010
I work weekends.

27:27.778 --> 27:29.978
Yeah, all right,
another time, maybe.

27:29.980 --> 27:31.348
Yeah, definitely.

27:44.894 --> 27:46.431
Sorry about the smell.

27:48.898 --> 27:50.701
You get used to it though.

27:53.770 --> 27:55.906
When was the last time
you were on stage?

27:58.875 --> 28:01.745
I don't like to think
about the past.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.116
You are the future.

28:09.787 --> 28:11.186
And here.

28:11.188 --> 28:12.220
No tension.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.921
You sing from here.

28:13.923 --> 28:15.390
Even your mouth is closed, yeah.

28:15.392 --> 28:18.427

28:42.553 --> 28:45.086
To maximize
our capacity to sing,

28:45.088 --> 28:49.123
we must first maximize
our capacity to breathe.

28:52.863 --> 28:56.364
So, place your hands
on your waist,

28:56.366 --> 29:00.805
so that your fingers
are pointing toward your navel.

29:02.239 --> 29:03.374
And now...

29:04.275 --> 29:06.811
feel the tension release.

29:08.278 --> 29:10.112
As you breathe in,

29:10.114 --> 29:15.249
let the air move through the
base of your diaphragm first.

29:15.251 --> 29:16.287
Now...

29:17.387 --> 29:23.461
your hands will slowly
rise and fall with each breath.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.332
Exhale.

29:28.365 --> 29:31.099
Feel extension of your body,
yeah?

29:42.078 --> 29:43.213
Now...

29:44.080 --> 29:46.849
we count down from five,

29:46.851 --> 29:48.453
breathing out slowly.

29:51.989 --> 29:53.588

Sing from your heart.

31:47.003 --> 31:48.572

This is it,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:08.143 --> 34:11.344
The judges have spoken and
these are your three finalists.

34:11.347 --> 34:15.349
But only one can make it through
to the grand finals in London

34:15.351 --> 34:18.385
and that audience
of 20 million viewers.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.626
Okay, so let's find out who's
going to be tonight's lucky star.

34:24.628 --> 34:26.695
Will it be Miss Valenski,

34:26.697 --> 34:28.262
The Extra-Terrestrials,

34:28.264 --> 34:29.699
or Angel X?

34:30.666 --> 34:32.434
We're gonna find out
who they are

34:32.436 --> 34:36.239
- in three, two, one...
- Three, two, one...

34:38.442 --> 34:40.708
Violet Valenski and Angel X,
stay where you are.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.577
You could be going through
to the grand final.

34:42.579 --> 34:44.344
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for them,

34:44.347 --> 34:47.181
in third place,
The Extra-Terrestrials!

34:47.184 --> 34:49.387
Unlucky, lads.

34:50.219 --> 34:52.652
Okay, so, we're down to two.

34:52.655 --> 34:55.489
Violet Valenski and Angel X.

34:55.492 --> 34:57.458
Now, as you know,
only one of them

34:57.460 --> 35:00.695
will make it through to that grand
final at London ExCeL in August,

35:00.697 --> 35:02.731
in front
of a global audience.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.736
But who is it gonna be?

35:07.871 --> 35:10.237
Well... we can find out.

35:10.239 --> 35:11.773
Because I now know

35:11.775 --> 35:14.579
what the judges have decided.

35:17.547 --> 35:18.914
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:18.916 --> 35:22.383
Your newest
Teen Spirit finalist is...

35:22.385 --> 35:23.552
Angel X!

35:46.443 --> 35:47.612
Where are you going?

35:48.344 --> 35:49.547
Meet you in the car.

36:14.905 --> 36:16.938
You were great tonight.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.807
It was the wrong song.
Should have done a ballad.

36:19.809 --> 36:21.476
It was the right song.

36:21.478 --> 36:22.847
You came second.

36:23.813 --> 36:24.813
Exactly.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.380
It was their mistake.

36:26.382 --> 36:28.416
We'll keep practicing.

36:28.418 --> 36:30.784
Next time
we'll go to the finals.

36:30.786 --> 36:32.422
There is no "next time."

36:34.324 --> 36:36.258
We'll rehearse every day.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.525
Work on your breathing.

36:37.527 --> 36:38.695
I will help you.

36:39.929 --> 36:41.396
Help me?

36:41.398 --> 36:43.367
You're a drunk
who sleeps in his car.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.574
You must not say that.

36:50.974 --> 36:52.343
It's true.

37:40.324 --> 37:41.525
Where are our drinks?

37:47.831 --> 37:49.863
There you go. Table four.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.365
I'm not taking that order.

37:51.367 --> 37:52.566
It's in your section.

37:52.568 --> 37:54.471
You do it.

38:18.961 --> 38:20.494
Thank you.

38:20.496 --> 38:21.528

38:26.737 --> 38:28.369

38:28.371 --> 38:29.804
Late marriage
with their parents, whatever.

38:29.806 --> 38:32.606
So he just ended up with
an attractive sister.

38:32.608 --> 38:34.742
You, you got a boyfriend?

38:34.744 --> 38:35.809
No.

38:35.811 --> 38:36.845
You?

38:36.847 --> 38:38.512
Louise doesn't like lads.

38:38.514 --> 38:40.815
- Believe me, I've tried.
- And he keeps trying.

38:40.817 --> 38:42.784
How long have you
been playing together?

38:42.786 --> 38:44.655
Um, not long. Three months.

38:45.956 --> 38:48.889
- How do you two know each other?
- School.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.124
- You know, just school.
- Right.

38:50.126 --> 38:51.726
Oh, my God.

38:51.728 --> 38:54.461
I'm so shit.

38:54.463 --> 38:56.130
- Did I miss it?
- No.

38:56.132 --> 38:57.664
I mean, yeah, you did miss
it, but you didn't miss much.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.336
You were supposed to text me.

39:00.003 --> 39:01.505
Yeah. Sorry.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.376
Is that it?

39:11.514 --> 39:13.180
- Well, that's a good price.
- Yeah.

39:13.182 --> 39:15.150
We should get out
of here as soon as we can

39:15.152 --> 39:16.684
before she changes her mind.

39:16.686 --> 39:18.086
- Come on then.
- Yeah?

39:18.088 --> 39:20.621
Scared to move her? Come on.

39:20.623 --> 39:22.090
Hey!

39:22.092 --> 39:23.791
What are you doing?
That's my horse.

39:23.793 --> 39:25.126
- Not anymore.
- What?

39:25.128 --> 39:27.162
- My brother paid for it already.
- What?

39:27.164 --> 39:30.097
- Paid who?
- I don't know her name. The, uh, the lady.

39:30.099 --> 39:31.699
- Wait.
- No, we have to go.

39:31.701 --> 39:33.200
Please, wait!

39:33.202 --> 39:34.771
Go on, hurry up then.

39:44.981 --> 39:45.947
Don't touch me!

40:49.079 --> 40:50.114
Is this you?

40:50.914 --> 40:52.550
This was me.

40:56.519 --> 40:58.222
I have no idea
what you're saying.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.255
But it sounds good.

41:01.257 --> 41:04.894
Well, Pinkerton is
American naval officer.

41:05.728 --> 41:06.927
Played by you?

41:06.929 --> 41:08.762
Played by me.

41:08.764 --> 41:12.700
His child bride
has a son in his absence.

41:12.702 --> 41:16.905
When he returns home,
he has new wife.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.677
The child bride is devastated.

41:20.943 --> 41:23.577
He realizes he has made
a terrible mistake,

41:23.579 --> 41:27.784
but he's too much
of a coward to face her.

41:28.717 --> 41:29.953
Does she forgive him?

41:31.253 --> 41:34.755
No. She kills herself.

41:34.757 --> 41:35.925
Depressing.

41:36.726 --> 41:38.561
Ah, it's opera.

41:49.005 --> 41:52.843
When I was little,
I caught my mum with someone.

41:55.911 --> 41:57.180
I didn't know him.

41:58.114 --> 41:59.717
And I never told my dad.

42:00.951 --> 42:02.186
But I didn't have to.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.523
A week later, he was gone.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.728
No note, no good-bye, nothing.

42:16.199 --> 42:18.269
A house is expensive to keep.

42:19.168 --> 42:20.904
Things break all the time.

42:21.838 --> 42:23.641
There's land,
and animals, and...

42:25.208 --> 42:27.077
She refuses to leave...

42:29.913 --> 42:31.916
because she thinks
he's coming back.

42:35.318 --> 42:36.954
He's not coming back.

42:37.987 --> 42:39.322
I know that now.

42:44.094 --> 42:45.695
Sorry about the other night.

42:46.396 --> 42:47.798
It's okay.

42:48.697 --> 42:50.134
You were disappointed.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.737
But I'm not
going to let you give up.

42:55.905 --> 42:57.875
I wasted my own talent.

42:59.141 --> 43:02.645
Maybe you're
my second chance to...

43:04.079 --> 43:05.648
be useful now.

43:07.717 --> 43:08.919
Well, that's good.

43:10.052 --> 43:11.621
Because I've got some news.

43:17.193 --> 43:19.263
You're wasting your time,
we can't pay you.

43:20.262 --> 43:21.798
Yes, this is Violet.

43:23.166 --> 43:24.868
They made a mistake.

43:26.202 --> 43:28.005
The girl who won my group...

43:29.972 --> 43:31.976
she was using a fake name.

43:34.043 --> 43:38.012
Turns out she'd already entered
another competition before.

43:42.719 --> 43:44.355
She's been disqualified.

43:56.099 --> 43:58.035
We're going to London, Vlad.

44:01.003 --> 44:02.373
Going to the finals.

44:03.773 --> 44:05.943
Wow.

44:12.449 --> 44:14.215
Here we are
on the Isle of Wight,

44:14.217 --> 44:17.251
a small but picturesque island
off the coast of England.

44:17.253 --> 44:21.255
And behind me,
the home of Violet Valenski,

44:21.257 --> 44:24.925
the first contestant from the island
to make the Teen Spirit finals.

44:24.927 --> 44:26.994
I never dreamed
I would make it this far.

44:26.996 --> 44:32.102
I keep waiting for them to call
back and say there's been a mistake.

44:35.938 --> 44:38.039
The competition, which provides
a platform for young British talent,

44:38.041 --> 44:39.474
has surged in popularity

44:39.476 --> 44:41.075
thanks to
high-profile contestants

44:41.077 --> 44:43.478
like Keyan Spears
and Three Two Tango.

44:45.981 --> 44:47.414
Violet, who lives alone
with her mother,

44:47.416 --> 44:49.950
has no expectations
of the same success,

44:49.952 --> 44:52.920
but looks forward to performing
on a global stage.

44:52.922 --> 44:54.755
I know I'm not
the best singer in England,

44:54.757 --> 44:56.490
but I'm gonna try to work
really hard to be a better one

44:56.492 --> 44:58.892
by the time we get to London.

44:58.894 --> 45:00.927
And forgive the question,

45:00.929 --> 45:03.097
but we have to ask,

45:03.099 --> 45:04.798
is there a special someone in your life?

45:04.800 --> 45:06.135
<i>No special someone.</i>

45:06.936 --> 45:08.172
<i>I don't believe in love.</i>

45:08.871 --> 45:10.139
Love's not real.

45:11.407 --> 45:17.311
<i>♪ I look up

45:17.313 --> 45:23.753

46:59.615 --> 47:03.416
Basically, Violet found out she got in
the final and needed a backing band.

47:03.418 --> 47:05.253
So, we were like, "Yes."

47:05.255 --> 47:07.420
And then we found out we had
to pay for our accommodation,

47:07.422 --> 47:09.322
so we were like, "No."

47:09.324 --> 47:11.325
And then Luke said he'd pay for
it, so we said yes again.

47:11.327 --> 47:12.659
No, I...

47:12.661 --> 47:14.030
No, I didn't.

47:14.597 --> 47:16.097
I'm not paying for it.

47:16.099 --> 47:17.530
Who is then?

47:17.532 --> 47:19.066
My mum's paying for it.

47:19.068 --> 47:20.367
May the Lord be with you.

47:20.369 --> 47:22.202
And with thy spirit.

47:22.204 --> 47:23.637
Thanks be to God.

47:23.639 --> 47:27.340
Before you go,
this is a special occasion.

47:27.342 --> 47:33.079
For one of our angels
has been blessed with a gift.

47:33.081 --> 47:39.387
May her faith and spirit give her
the strength to overcome temptation,

47:39.389 --> 47:42.559
and lead her
on the path to prosperity.

47:43.927 --> 47:46.096
- Amen.
- Amen.

47:52.601 --> 47:54.534
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:54.536 --> 47:57.206
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's not for you.

47:58.141 --> 48:00.010
Ma, Vlad's here.

48:05.114 --> 48:06.282
It's for you.

48:07.382 --> 48:08.918
That's very...

48:09.652 --> 48:11.021
unexpected.

48:13.088 --> 48:16.259
A woman like you should
get flowers every day.

48:17.059 --> 48:18.992
It's still 15 percent.

48:18.994 --> 48:20.594
All right...

48:22.231 --> 48:24.264
We should hit the road.

48:24.266 --> 48:26.666
Should I help with your bags?

48:26.668 --> 48:29.503
They... They're, um...
They're upstairs.

48:29.505 --> 48:30.673
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

48:31.474 --> 48:33.043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:35.010 --> 48:36.213
I got you something.

48:37.112 --> 48:39.079
So I know you're safe.

48:39.081 --> 48:41.148
There's some credit on it.

48:41.150 --> 48:43.653
It will be cheaper than
using the phone at the hotel.

48:44.586 --> 48:46.253
I'll call
as soon as I get there.

48:46.255 --> 48:47.291
Good.

49:28.398 --> 49:31.201
We are going for four days.

49:50.318 --> 49:54.521
There's this train in London,
the Eurostar,

49:54.523 --> 49:56.559
it goes from London
to Paris direct.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.762
Ah...

49:59.628 --> 50:01.597
Paris is expensive.

50:02.597 --> 50:04.333
Not if we make our millions.

50:06.402 --> 50:07.771
Your daughter's there, no?

50:11.541 --> 50:13.610
You should visit her
after the finals.

50:44.873 --> 50:46.407
Miss Valenski.

50:46.409 --> 50:48.175
- Hi.
- Welcome to London.

50:48.177 --> 50:49.809
My name is Yuriy.

50:49.811 --> 50:52.081
I'll be taking care of you
over the next few days.

50:52.715 --> 50:53.680
This is Vlad.

50:53.682 --> 50:55.148
Hey, I'm manager.

50:55.150 --> 50:56.450
Vlad, a pleasure.

50:56.452 --> 50:58.786
That's our band,
Louise, Luke, Rollo.

50:58.788 --> 51:01.554
The band will have to
check in on the lower level.

51:01.556 --> 51:03.125
Sam will show you.

51:04.260 --> 51:05.860
Okay, bye.

51:05.862 --> 51:07.161
Luke.

51:07.163 --> 51:08.528
Luke, you are in charge, yeah?

51:08.530 --> 51:10.130
- Nothing from the minibar.
- Yeah, okay.

51:10.132 --> 51:12.666
- Hey, I'll be checking, yeah.
- Yes, okay.

51:12.668 --> 51:14.805
Violet, Vlad,
if you'd like to follow me.

51:24.579 --> 51:25.813
This room's for me?

51:25.815 --> 51:27.882
Yes, of course.

51:27.884 --> 51:30.483
Mr. Brajkovic,
we have you right next door.

51:30.485 --> 51:31.719
Good.

51:31.721 --> 51:34.220
This is your itinerary
for the weekend.

51:34.222 --> 51:35.755
You have about 30 minutes

51:35.757 --> 51:38.726
and then I will meet on
the conference room on level B.

51:38.728 --> 51:39.793
I can take it.

51:39.795 --> 51:41.461
Very good.

51:41.463 --> 51:43.597
I'll let you get settled
and meet you downstairs.

51:43.599 --> 51:44.768
Thank you.

51:50.239 --> 51:54.407
Mm. You have to do
a television promo.

51:54.409 --> 51:55.909
What for?

51:55.911 --> 51:57.577
For the broadcast
on Sunday.

51:57.579 --> 51:59.315
Everybody has to do it.

52:00.782 --> 52:04.184
It's nothing,
just say your name and, uh...

52:04.186 --> 52:06.222
where you are from, or...

52:08.590 --> 52:10.460
What do you want to wear?

52:12.327 --> 52:13.563
I'll wear this.

52:16.498 --> 52:19.900
Hey, we're The Shades.
Vote for us tomorrow on Teen Spirit.

52:19.902 --> 52:23.237
Hi, I'm Thomas King.
Vote for me tomorrow on Teen Spirit.

52:23.239 --> 52:26.809
Hi, I'm Violet, and you can vote for
me tomorrow night on Teen Spirit.

52:28.311 --> 52:32.545
Hi, we're Peckham Rose.
Vote for us tomorrow on Teen Spirit.

52:32.547 --> 52:36.652
I'm Roxy. You can vote for me
tomorrow night on Teen Spirit.

53:27.637 --> 53:29.903
Holy shit,
this is massive.

53:29.905 --> 53:31.341
Yeah.

53:33.376 --> 53:35.041
Oi, it's that foxy Roxy.

53:35.043 --> 53:37.580
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's fit.

53:38.748 --> 53:40.914
Nah.
No, she's not my type.

53:43.385 --> 53:46.287
- What?
- Shut up.

53:46.289 --> 53:48.588
- And a side of chips.
- <i>Told ya. He's not good enough for you.</i>

53:48.590 --> 53:51.661
Mm-hmm.
Okay, thank you.

53:54.829 --> 53:56.829
<i>That doesn't make you
any less strong.</i>

53:56.831 --> 53:58.666
<i>To have somebody
care about ya.</i>

53:58.668 --> 54:01.802
<i>I know that you care.
I just want you to care less.</i>

54:01.804 --> 54:05.706
<i>Ever since Mum's died all you've been
doing is just taking it out on me.</i>

54:06.909 --> 54:07.907
<i>You're gonna set me off now.</i>

54:07.909 --> 54:09.311
That was quick.

54:09.811 --> 54:11.412
Hmm, housekeeper.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.016
Hmm. They came already.

54:14.817 --> 54:16.786
<i>I know
I'm not the perfect dad...</i>

54:21.791 --> 54:23.860
Uh... Can I help you?

54:36.938 --> 54:40.007
Everybody
seems to have no clothes on at all.

54:40.009 --> 54:41.974
Why is it that all
of the stories you tell me...

54:41.976 --> 54:45.813
I know. I have absolutely no...
Ooh, hang on.

54:45.815 --> 54:48.418
This one... This one is for later.

54:48.951 --> 54:51.017
Hi, hi!

54:51.019 --> 54:53.554
Uh, Alexa's being an idiot.
Ignore her.

54:53.556 --> 54:55.054
Everyone...

54:55.056 --> 54:56.590
this is Violet.

54:56.592 --> 54:59.659
- And, uh, Mr...
- Brajkovic.

54:59.661 --> 55:01.397
Jules. Hi.

55:02.898 --> 55:04.965
- Everything is okay?
- Mm.

55:04.967 --> 55:06.532
Please take a seat.

55:06.534 --> 55:08.637
Mm, go on.

55:09.739 --> 55:11.104
This is Marcus.

55:11.106 --> 55:12.805
He's on the board committee.

55:12.807 --> 55:15.344
He's very posh,
so we have to be nice to him.

55:16.144 --> 55:17.443
Is something wrong?

55:17.445 --> 55:19.412
No, on the contrary.

55:19.414 --> 55:23.083
We have an opportunity
that, uh, I think might appeal.

55:23.085 --> 55:25.719
What kind of opportunity?

55:25.721 --> 55:29.889
We would like to offer
Violet a contract

55:29.891 --> 55:31.627
ahead of tomorrow's performance.

55:32.394 --> 55:33.762
A record contract.

55:34.797 --> 55:36.130
No guarantees, of course,

55:36.132 --> 55:38.030
but you would have studio time

55:38.032 --> 55:41.467
and you'd be working
with songwriters and...

55:41.469 --> 55:45.341
you would have an incredible
management team behind you.

55:46.608 --> 55:49.142
Oh, Violet, this is Keyan.

55:49.144 --> 55:52.815
Obviously he's a total miscreant,
but he can vouch for us.

55:53.782 --> 55:55.749
They're amazing.

55:55.751 --> 55:58.985
Piss off.

55:58.987 --> 56:00.456
No, really, I...

56:00.956 --> 56:02.155
It's been great.

56:02.157 --> 56:04.728
She has a manager already.

56:05.628 --> 56:07.961
She doesn't need two.

56:07.963 --> 56:10.831
Well, as you know,
there is occasional precedent

56:10.833 --> 56:13.867
of the final winner getting
an opportunity like this.

56:13.869 --> 56:15.769
But we wanted to
come to you now,

56:15.771 --> 56:17.938
ahead of tomorrow's performance.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.075
Why me?

56:20.175 --> 56:22.041
'Cause you're a caterpillar.

56:22.043 --> 56:23.744
We're a cocoon.

56:23.746 --> 56:27.016
Maybe, together,
we make a butterfly.

56:28.016 --> 56:29.852
Or maybe not.

56:30.885 --> 56:32.985
We wanna give it a shot.

56:32.987 --> 56:36.956
And this way, you have a safety
net, no matter what happens.

56:36.958 --> 56:39.927
That way, you can
go out tomorrow and relax.

56:39.929 --> 56:43.800
Just sing
without all the... presh.

56:44.599 --> 56:47.166
And what if she wins

56:47.168 --> 56:50.070
and somebody else
makes an offer?

56:50.072 --> 56:51.905
Better offer.

56:51.907 --> 56:53.807
Well, then that would be great.
I'd be very happy for you.

56:53.809 --> 56:55.478
Hmm.

56:56.545 --> 57:01.113
She's not signing anything
until I've read it.

57:01.115 --> 57:03.617
- Vlad.
- Look, take the night to think about it.

57:03.619 --> 57:06.887
But you have to sign
before the show or it's a no-go.

57:06.889 --> 57:08.057
That's the deal.

57:09.023 --> 57:10.692
Thank you
for thinking of me.

57:11.693 --> 57:13.260
Sounds really exciting.

57:13.262 --> 57:14.628
Well, good.

57:14.630 --> 57:15.729
It is exciting.

57:18.067 --> 57:19.999
What's your name again?

57:20.001 --> 57:23.003
Brajkovic.
Vladimir Brajkovic.

57:23.005 --> 57:24.441
Right, of course it is.

57:28.244 --> 57:29.976
He seems nice.

57:29.978 --> 57:31.047
He is.

57:31.981 --> 57:34.014
Does he know
what he's doing?

57:34.016 --> 57:37.784
He's not a real manager or anything,
but he has done a lot for me.

57:37.786 --> 57:39.456
We can do a lot more.

57:45.094 --> 57:47.728
Five, six, seven, eight.

57:47.730 --> 57:49.795
So, lift over, up.

57:49.797 --> 57:51.632
Taking your head over
and around.

57:51.634 --> 57:54.938
Back, side, and to side, side.

57:59.742 --> 58:01.577
And then we'll move
into the lift.

58:05.146 --> 58:07.680
- What do you reckon?
- Sorry. Um...

58:07.682 --> 58:10.619
Yeah, I'm sorry, this...

58:11.186 --> 58:12.722
It's just a little...

58:13.155 --> 58:14.490
Um...

58:15.023 --> 58:16.159
Awkward?

58:17.259 --> 58:18.628
Yeah.

58:21.597 --> 58:24.097
Okay, what about
something a bit more simple?

58:24.099 --> 58:25.602
So...

58:26.668 --> 58:29.873
we are on opposite sides
of the stage...

58:30.873 --> 58:32.942
and then we walk to one another.

58:33.742 --> 58:35.575
Then meet in the center.

58:35.577 --> 58:37.813
Then we lean in...

58:38.914 --> 58:40.717
And I lean in like I'm...

58:41.215 --> 58:42.684
I'm gonna kiss her.

58:43.751 --> 58:45.288
And just as I get to here,

58:46.922 --> 58:48.789
the rest of
the contestants enter

58:48.791 --> 58:50.891
and they break the moment.

58:50.893 --> 58:53.128
Um,
and what about the lift?

58:55.297 --> 58:56.865
Maybe cut the lift.

58:57.900 --> 58:59.068
Okay.

59:00.869 --> 59:01.871
Great.

59:02.972 --> 59:08.374
And then, for the end
show, try this jacket.

59:08.376 --> 59:09.842
Um...

59:09.844 --> 59:12.211
Pink looks so good on you,
so...

59:12.213 --> 59:15.117
I think the tones are gonna be great.
And then the skirt.

59:19.288 --> 59:23.690
You know, if you sign this,
you are signing me out of your life.

59:23.692 --> 59:25.124
Stop being dramatic.

59:25.126 --> 59:26.392
I'm not.

59:26.394 --> 59:27.797
Have you read it? Huh?

59:28.963 --> 59:31.166
It's bad contract.
You sign away everything.

59:32.101 --> 59:34.034
Keyan signed it.

59:34.036 --> 59:36.068
He's doing all right,
if you ask me.

59:36.070 --> 59:37.673
Yeah, yeah.

59:38.740 --> 59:40.039
Shouldn't be going out.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.974
Should be resting your voice.

59:41.976 --> 59:44.344
You're the one that told me
to be more social.

59:44.346 --> 59:46.679
Da, but not the night
before the show.

59:46.681 --> 59:47.983
I'll just go for an hour.

59:51.253 --> 59:52.755
What do you think?

59:54.956 --> 59:56.092
Good.

59:56.759 --> 59:57.961
Too much makeup.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.164
They said I might
be able to keep the shoes.

01:00:03.931 --> 01:00:06.932
Don't look so worried.
I'm not even leaving the hotel.

01:00:06.934 --> 01:00:09.670
Uh, maybe
I should come with you, huh?

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.804
No. That's weird.

01:00:11.806 --> 01:00:14.775
- You have your phone?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:15.909
No drinks.

01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:17.280
Hey, you too.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.750

Mate, what are you doing?

01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:06.266
- She's absolutely fine.
- Yeah, I wasn't talking to you.

01:05:06.268 --> 01:05:09.001
- Come on.
- Hey, I said leave her alone.

01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:54.317

- To find a drink.

and found at the hotel.

Sorry.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.429

01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:51.599

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:56.838

what's next for you
after tonight's performance?

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:21.395
A long, hot bath and...

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.363
a cheeseburger.

01:08:24.365 --> 01:08:27.232
Any questions
for our other contestants?

01:08:27.234 --> 01:08:29.337
Anyone?

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:56.899
I think that...

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:05.270
Sorry.

01:09:27.362 --> 01:09:28.529

No, I...

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:37.603
Keyan told me about
the, uh, incident, last night.

01:09:37.604 --> 01:09:40.542
Sounds like it was
very embarrassing for everyone.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.875
Yeah.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:45.544
He's upset, understandably,
but I spoke to him

01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:48.548
and he's agreed
not to make a fuss.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:49.716
Thank you.

01:09:50.783 --> 01:09:53.518
Vlad just gets
a little drunk sometimes.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.920
He's a teddy bear, really.

01:09:54.922 --> 01:09:57.490
Oh. No, of course.

01:09:57.492 --> 01:10:00.425
Look, who you make friends with,
it's none of my business.

01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:04.796
My business is making sure
that talented people like you

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:06.866
get what they want.

01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:08.537
How do you know what I want?

01:10:10.404 --> 01:10:11.539
I don't.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.809
You're right.

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:21.216
You tell me.

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:28.990
Why did you enter
this competition?

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.891
I like to sing.

01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:34.930
Well, yes. Well, a lot
of people like to sing.

01:10:35.863 --> 01:10:38.299
You can sing.

01:10:39.434 --> 01:10:41.869
But the reality is...

01:10:43.637 --> 01:10:46.039
you're
an inexperienced performer

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:49.741
with a Polish name
and a posh accent,

01:10:49.743 --> 01:10:53.648
entering a competition
that relies on the public vote.

01:10:54.716 --> 01:10:58.721
Now... let's imagine,
just hypothetically,

01:10:59.453 --> 01:11:01.322
you pull off a win.

01:11:01.956 --> 01:11:03.792
Well, then what? Hmm?

01:11:04.926 --> 01:11:07.496
What's the best-case scenario
in that outcome?

01:11:10.364 --> 01:11:12.967
- I get a record deal.
- You get a record deal.

01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:19.307
You've already won.

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:24.680
All you need to do is sign.

01:11:26.413 --> 01:11:27.714
You know...

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.852
life comes down
to these moments, Violet.

01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:32.654
Don't take them for granted.

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:36.656
Oh...

01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:37.793
I nearly forgot.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.828
I found your necklace.

01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:35.650
Ten-minute warning.

01:12:37.018 --> 01:12:38.617
If you see Vlad...

01:12:38.619 --> 01:12:40.355
I'll tell him you're here.

01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:18.691
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

01:13:18.693 --> 01:13:22.894
welcome to
the UK Teen Spirit finals!

01:13:26.134 --> 01:13:28.634
Streaming for the first time

01:13:28.636 --> 01:13:31.940
to over a hundred countries
worldwide.

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:33.841
Pretty good.

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:37.945
Somebody turn up
the volume, huh?

01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:42.682
...have been through the most
rigorous selection process

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.151
to stand on this stage
for you tonight.

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:50.623
And now it's up to you, the
audience, to decide their fate.

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:52.825
So, without further ado,

01:13:52.827 --> 01:13:56.027

year's winner, Keyan Spears,

something happened to him?

01:17:05.686 --> 01:17:07.053

Thanks, Yuriy.

01:18:37.912 --> 01:18:39.280
You look like shit.

01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:42.150
I haven't showered.

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:44.752
Lost my room key.

01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:57.466
Don't disappear again.

01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:03.968
The crowd is loud,
so I told Louise not to hold back.

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.571
And you don't look
in camera,

01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:08.176
it makes
the audience uncomfortable.

01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:12.913
Make sure you focus on your
breathing like we practiced.

01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:14.949
Good.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:21.355

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:32.434
She was nice about it.

01:19:34.902 --> 01:19:36.872
