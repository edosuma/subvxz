00:11.970 --> 00:13.388
- You've made
a lot of progress

00:13.471 --> 00:15.974
these last few months.

00:16.057 --> 00:20.311
Alice, are you listening?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.147
- I haven't seen
that here before.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.149
It wasn't here last week.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.944
- That's true. It's new.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.363
What do you think of it?

00:30.447 --> 00:33.074
- Looks like a picture of hell.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.826
- Interesting.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.287
It's titled "Utopia."

00:37.370 --> 00:39.414
- Well, it sucks.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.459
- Alice, I'd like to try
a new activity with you today.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.135
Breathe.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.139
- The phone isn't on.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.100
It's just plastic. No insides.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.102
It can't hurt you.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.062
If we're gonna have you enter
the world out there again,

01:03.146 --> 01:06.441
you're going to have to get
comfortable seeing these.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.738
I'm gonna slowly...
push it towards you.

01:11.821 --> 01:15.784
No.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.914
You fucking idiot.
Now he can track us.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.123
Byron Gogol wants...
- Alice.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.374
- To control you!
- Alice...

01:23.458 --> 01:24.584
- He wants
to control everybody!

01:24.667 --> 01:25.668
And he can do it!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.295
He's got
the technology to do it.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.880
Please!
I'm fucking--

01:43.019 --> 01:44.521
- I'm gonna get changed
and check on my dad.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.105
- Can you just wait
one second?

01:46.189 --> 01:48.691
I have someone bringing
something up for you.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.153
There he is now.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.655
- Bruce.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.989
- Yes, Mrs. Gogol?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.367
- How long have you worked
for Byron?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.661
- 16 years, Mrs. Gogol.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.204
- And so do you--
do you know

02:01.287 --> 02:04.499
anything about a woman
that he brought in here

02:04.582 --> 02:07.710
before me?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.421
- Thank you, Bruce.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.512
- What's that?

02:17.595 --> 02:20.056
- It's your mother, Hazel.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.808
I am--sorry, no.
I sh--I should have said

02:21.891 --> 02:25.019
it's dynamic reconfigured
recordings of your mother.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.688
Before you spoke
at the hearing,

02:26.771 --> 02:29.190
I didn't realize how much pain
you were still carrying

02:29.274 --> 02:31.901
due to her loss.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.028
I wish I'd met her.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.031
- What do you mean,
recordings of my--

02:37.115 --> 02:38.575
of my--of my mother?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.535
- There was ten years
of recorded calls

02:40.618 --> 02:42.036
from when your mom was

02:42.120 --> 02:44.622
a customer service
representative at CAL Premium.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.041
It was a huge data set.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.879
Enough that our AI engineers
were able to

02:50.962 --> 02:53.047
create a program that predicts

02:53.131 --> 02:55.884
optimized real-time responses

02:55.967 --> 02:58.720
based on your mother's
communications.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.390
It's not perfect, but she--

03:02.473 --> 03:04.601
she definitely was a talker.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.441
The accuracy rate is about 84%.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.401
- What?

03:13.484 --> 03:16.696
- You can speak
with your mother again.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.160
I'll just give you two
some--some space.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.978
Hello?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.898
- Hazel?
Is that you?

03:51.981 --> 03:53.274
It's Mom.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.701
Oh. Byron.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
- Dr. Hau.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.461
Welcome home.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.338
- Delete the copy
of Hazel's consciousness

04:15.421 --> 04:17.924
from the Hub cloud immediately.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.092
- Delete?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.802
I don't understand. Why?

04:20.885 --> 04:23.012
- Um, well, Hazel is
starting to trust me,

04:23.096 --> 04:25.473
and I don't want
to compromise that.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.059
Thank you.
- Oh, I see.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.477
Because you copied
her consciousness

04:29.560 --> 04:31.270
without her consent?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.023
- It was
more of an insurance policy,

04:34.107 --> 04:38.319
but I now see
the error of my ways.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.696
Delete it.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.572
- Very well.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.074
I just need you
to log yourself in

04:43.157 --> 04:44.993
so you can make the deletion.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.245
I don't have the authority.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.455
- Of course, yes.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.048
- For what it's worth,

04:59.132 --> 05:00.883
you don't need to worry
about Hazel figuring out

05:00.967 --> 05:01.926
what you did.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.012
- Yeah? And why is that?

05:04.095 --> 05:06.931
- Because I already know.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.190
- What's wrong, hunny-bunny?

05:16.274 --> 05:17.608
Something's not right.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.611
I can hear it in your voice.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.364
- All I said was...hello.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.283
- Well, I know your "hello."

05:25.366 --> 05:27.368
What's going on? Talk to me.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.664
Do you want to tell me
what you had for lunch?

05:33.791 --> 05:35.585
- I forgot
what you sounded like.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.840
- Well, it's good to hear
your voice too.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.718
And now we can talk
whenever you want.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.220
- How's Daddy?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.931
Is he still acting
like a grumpy dumpling?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.851
I forgot
that you called him that.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.065
- Um, he's good.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.567
Uh, he's--he's still Dad.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.779
He, um...

06:02.862 --> 06:04.989
he got a little weirder.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.411
- I can't wait to hear
all about it.

06:15.958 --> 06:20.171
- Yeah, I should go,
um, check on him actually...

06:22.840 --> 06:24.759
Mom.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.387
- Okay, hon.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.347
Oh, and Hazel...

06:29.430 --> 06:30.640
- Yeah?

06:30.723 --> 06:31.933
- Would you be
willing to answer

06:32.016 --> 06:33.142
some brief survey questions

06:33.226 --> 06:35.686
regarding your call today?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.863
- Byron?

06:45.947 --> 06:49.283
We did it.
We made it out.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.911
- Is this the real world?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.329
- Yes.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.289
You're in your body.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.558
Oh, Byron!

07:15.059 --> 07:17.687
I get to touch you.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.564
This is what I wanted.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.610
- Feels so good.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.905
- You feel so good.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.959
No, wait, wait. Wait.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.295
- What?
- Not yet.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.463
Let's wait
till I'm in my real body.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.756
- Okay.

07:45.840 --> 07:50.636
- I want our first time
to be perfect.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.474
- Jasper?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.559
- Gotta go.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.935
- How are you today?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.228
- I'm great, thanks.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.688
- It's just that
by this point

08:00.771 --> 08:02.648
in your acclimation
to the Hub,

08:02.732 --> 08:07.653
you and I should be
a lot more...bonded?

08:07.737 --> 08:08.988
- Uh-huh. Okay.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.365
Well, we're cool, right?

08:11.449 --> 08:14.452
Yeah, I feel pretty--pretty--
pretty close here.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.953
- Let's do something together.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.497
We could play cards.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.626
Or do you like to dance?

08:21.709 --> 08:25.755
I'm a very good dancer.
I could teach you.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.224
- Okay, um, yeah,
and we'll do that,

08:36.307 --> 08:37.892
but next time, okay?

08:37.975 --> 08:39.936
I'll see you later.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.238
- Fucking dead end.
How did this happen?

08:50.321 --> 08:51.572
- Well, either Hazel
turned on us

08:51.656 --> 08:52.782
or Byron found the tracker.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.953
It was
a fucking rhetorical question.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.037
- Sorry, bro.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.038
- No, I'm sorry.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.873
I'm stressed. I fucked up.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.583
I might have fucked up.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.960
No, I-I-I fucked up in D.C.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.002
I-I was drinking.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.379
- Oh, no.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.422
Hanky Panky make
another fucking joke?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.592
- To Hazel about sleeping
with Agent Robinson--Jasper.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.927
- Loose lips sink ships, man.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.262
- I know.
I fucking know that, okay?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.764
Now, how do we get
Jasper out now?

09:16.847 --> 09:20.101
- Well, at least he doesn't
have a wife and kids.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.562
- So what, it doesn't matter
if he dies?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.106
That is--that's--what?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.357
What is that look?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.775
What, did you shit
your pants again?

09:27.858 --> 09:31.195
- Sir, you need
to come see this.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.321
- So he doesn't have
a wife and kids.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.948
We can kill him.
- Fuck.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.617
- I didn't do it.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.203
Well, I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.206
Where are you taking me?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.833
- I wonder
if they were a couple.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.336
- You want to be buried
like that with me someday?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.011
- If we're going to see

09:55.094 --> 09:56.470
where the underwater
tunnels go,

09:56.554 --> 09:58.389
you should know something.
- Okay.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.726
- We'll be swimming to places
I haven't explored before.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.061
It's uncharted territory,
even for me.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.105
I can't guarantee your safety.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.648
- Yeah, but if you think
Fiffany's in here,

10:07.732 --> 10:09.317
we should try
to find her, right?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.943
- Why are you willing
to risk your life

10:11.027 --> 10:12.778
for someone you haven't met?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.406
- 'Cause maybe I want to meet
the woman who made you so cool.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.784
- Hmm.
Good answer, Jasper.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.539
- Aren't you trying
to stay away from the feds?

10:23.622 --> 10:26.417
This doesn't seem
like the best place to be.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.877
- Is that a body?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.837
- Oh, my God.
Let me see it. Let me see.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.297
- Excuse you, Hannibal Lecter.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.050
You are way too excited
about a corpse.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.345
- It's covered with a tarp.
I can't even see it.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.055
This is
the worst vacation ever.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.098
- This is not a vacation.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.558
Damn it.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.852
I was hoping we could see
who lives in the Benson farm

10:44.935 --> 10:46.354
and get some clues.
- Shit.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.482
- We can't go
anywhere near that place now.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.777
- So we rolled
all this way for nothing?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.529
- Nope.
We go to Plan B.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.199
Back when Byron Gogol
was just Montana's

10:58.282 --> 11:01.202
good ol' Greg Benson,
he had a wife.

11:01.285 --> 11:04.205
She still lives here.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.040
Come on.
- Okay.

11:29.063 --> 11:33.067
Dad, when--
when did you find out?

11:36.362 --> 11:39.490
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

11:39.573 --> 11:42.243
- Do what you gotta do.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.370
- It'll be much easier
if you don't fight this.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.747
- What?
Dad, what did she--

11:46.831 --> 11:48.707
- You're not my daughter.
- What?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.469
- Are you okay, Dad?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.346
- Yeah.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.723
- I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get the gurney.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.766
You stay here?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.726
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.049
Hello?

12:39.133 --> 12:42.720
- My God, Herbert?
Is that you?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.479
- Feeling better?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.105
- To be honest, no.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.398
- Oh.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.693
Being honest now.
That's cute. I like that.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.113
- Do you have
something to say, Lyle?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.157
- Well, if I'm being honest,
then yes.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.117
I do have something to say.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.663
- Where did you get that?

13:09.747 --> 13:11.165
- I poured my heart out
to you in here.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.459
I told you everything
about myself.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.044
At the very least,
you could have mentioned

13:15.127 --> 13:16.086
that you have a kid.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.087
- I don't.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.380
- Oh, come on, Fiff.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.341
I know the pictures are real.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.842
I found a bunch of my own too.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.595
Come on, this is not
a Bennet photoshop job.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.180
He's not that good.
- No.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.765
That's not me.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.851
That's my twin sister, Bessica.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.194
You expecting anybody?

13:40.277 --> 13:41.654
- No.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.701
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.415
Bessica, get out of the rain.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.583
Come in, come in.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.553
I can't do this alone.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.973
- Darling, isn't it time
you told the father?

14:15.104 --> 14:18.190
- Ignacio, that's your son.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.278
- What?

14:22.361 --> 14:23.737
- You weren't
gonna give him a baby,

14:23.821 --> 14:26.240
and I wanted one.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.703
We slept together
several times last year.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.996
- What?

14:32.079 --> 14:33.497
- Is this true?

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
- Of course not.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.042
- The kitchen floor.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.377
The office desk.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.088
Right here
where we're standing now.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.424
- I didn't know, Fiffany.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.427
I thought she was you, I swear.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.143
- Hmm.
You did know.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.563
Zelda always barks at Bessica.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.233
- Fiffany...

15:06.780 --> 15:08.490
Fiffany, don't go!

15:10.034 --> 15:12.620
- Fiff! Fiff!

15:14.496 --> 15:17.291
- The rain in here is my fault.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.293
That's my trigger.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.794
The rain reminds me
of the night

15:20.878 --> 15:23.380
that I lost the two
most important people

15:23.464 --> 15:25.132
in my life.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.842
I left Washington the next day

15:26.925 --> 15:29.303
and, uh, never went back.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.889
- Damn, Fiff, that is brutal.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.432
You didn't deserve that.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.978
- After that night,
I decided to focus

15:38.062 --> 15:41.148
my research wholly
on communicating with animals.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.984
They're they only ones
who you can trust.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.237
I resolved never to trust
another human being again.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.282
Till you.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.534
I've never had a friend
like you, Lyle.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.495
I mean, fuck, you even gave me

15:54.578 --> 15:57.414
your shoes to wear
when we first got here.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.669
I love you.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.297
- I love you too, Fiffy.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.800
Hey.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.009
I'm a tight hugger.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.636
You're gonna have
to get used to it.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.225
- Hey, when you said
you loved me,

16:16.308 --> 16:17.685
you didn't mean, like--

16:17.768 --> 16:18.686
- No.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.521
Jesus.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.439
Don't ruin a good moment.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.857
- That's, uh--
that's my specialty.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.860
- Oh.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.113
- All right, level with me:
did you tell boss man

16:29.196 --> 16:30.823
about my fuckup
with Princess Gogol?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.449
- Oh, Jesus, no.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.494
How can you
even ask me that, man?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.706
We're homeys.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.207
- We're homeys, man.
We are homeys.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.459
- Yeah.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.962
- I think this is the end
of the line for us, homey.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.213
We fucked Jasper.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.590
We f...

16:48.674 --> 16:50.050
We gotta figure out
our second act.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.468
We gotta figure out
what we're gonna do.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.886
- My mom could always use
extra people

16:52.970 --> 16:55.055
at her nail salon.
- I love feet.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.685
Sit.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.149
There's no easy way
to say this.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.405
- You're both getting promoted.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.490
Those two bodies you found
up there in Montana

17:13.574 --> 17:15.993
turned out to be linked
to a huge cold case.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.413
Some very rich and powerful
people are involved.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.789
You guys are heroes.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.584
- Thank you, sir.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.085
So does this mean
we get offices now

17:25.169 --> 17:26.545
or do we still have to be
out in the bullpen?

17:26.628 --> 17:28.047
Right?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.591
So what--what about
the Gogol case?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.217
And--and Jasper?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.761
- A problem for tomorrow.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.472
Ah, shit.
Tomorrow's Saturday.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.098
A problem for next week.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.893
Today, we celebrate.
Gail?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.687
all:

17:53.822 --> 17:56.074
- What is this place?

17:58.368 --> 18:00.954
- Yo, this a mental hospital.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.290
- Hmm.
Well, maybe she works here.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.625
Or is a patient.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.293
Well, either way,
we about to find out.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.378
- Uh, you can't just drop in.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.880
My cousin was
in a place like this

18:09.963 --> 18:11.340
and I had to fill out
a bunch of paperwork

18:11.423 --> 18:13.050
and take a drug test
just to visit.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.635
- Hmm.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.512
Well, how's security in there?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.431
- I don't know.
I never passed the drug test.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.767
Come on, this is mad boring.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.143
I used up all my Ritalin

18:23.227 --> 18:24.812
to drive your ass to Montana.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.730
You owe me something fun.

18:27.940 --> 18:32.069
- How about a quick trip
to the costume shop?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.654
Let's go.
- What?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.044
- Hi, Hazel.

18:51.588 --> 18:55.175
- It worked.
- It did.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.735
- We're home now.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.372
Ooh!

20:07.456 --> 20:08.749
Mm!

20:08.832 --> 20:12.002
I look fine as hell
in this suit.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.837
- I really like
that little square

20:13.921 --> 20:14.963
on your throat.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.048
It's sexy.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.674
- Oh, yeah?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.259
Maybe tonight,

20:19.343 --> 20:21.553
I could help you
confess your sins.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.471
- Shh.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.805
You two stop being horny

20:23.889 --> 20:25.724
and let's hurry up.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.937
- Excuse me?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.188
- Oh, hi.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.982
Uh, we are here
to give Communion.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.319
- Oh, well, Father O'Malley's
normal the one

20:37.402 --> 20:40.113
who gives Communion
to the patients.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.698
- Yeah, we got it from him.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.952
He's, like, our supplier.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.705
- The body-ody-ody of Christ!

20:48.789 --> 20:51.083
- Okay, but let me just
give him a call real quick,

20:51.166 --> 20:53.126
just to double-check this.
- Oh, okay.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.254
But if he doesn't answer,
he's in a police interview.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.967
- What?
- Oh.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.636
Oh, you didn't hear?
Oh, very upsetting.

21:02.719 --> 21:06.640
But Father O'Malley has had
some prior indiscretions

21:06.723 --> 21:09.601
come to light.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.812
- Oh.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.816
- I'm swimming!

21:15.899 --> 21:18.443
- She's swimming!
Whoo-hoo!

21:18.527 --> 21:20.445
- Water feels so good.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.156
- Bennett!
Hey, come over here,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.993
you red-headed stallion.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.828
- Bennett!

21:27.911 --> 21:29.329
- Sir, you're both unclothed.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.957
- You can get naked too.
It feels good.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.458
- Or you can sit
on the edge of the pool

21:33.542 --> 21:35.085
like someone who hates fun.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.254
- Funny.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.177
- Bennett.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.434
How's it going, Bennett?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.436
- Um, well, Mrs. G,

21:52.519 --> 21:54.271
media requests
are pouring in for you

21:54.354 --> 21:55.939
after your congressional
performance.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.484
So I guess I wasn't alone
in thinking it was superb.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.780
- No, I meant, how are you?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.824
- You've never asked me
that before.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.787
- I'm good.
- I'm glad to hear that.

22:10.871 --> 22:15.375
Well, I have to go
say hi to my dad.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.210
- Oh.

22:27.971 --> 22:31.308
- Keep him good company,
okay?

22:31.391 --> 22:33.894
Thank you.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.062
- Bye!

22:35.145 --> 22:36.188
- Bye.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.856
- You know what's great,
Bennett?

22:37.939 --> 22:39.900
- Um, I particularly like
the smell

22:39.983 --> 22:41.359
of a fresh Gogol phone

22:41.443 --> 22:43.737
when you take the thin
plastic film off of it.

22:43.820 --> 22:47.074
You're so funny.

22:47.157 --> 22:50.452
No, what--what I was--
what I was gonna say

22:50.535 --> 22:52.704
was that even though
you work for me,

22:52.788 --> 22:56.208
I genuinely enjoy
spending time with you.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.543
- I feel the same way.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.005
Yeah.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.342
How about you and me
go make some sandwiches.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.302
Yeah.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.860
- Herbert?

23:26.321 --> 23:29.783
- I can hear you breathing
on the phone.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.802
- Is it you?

23:48.885 --> 23:52.806
- Yeah. It's me.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.224
I mean...

23:56.726 --> 23:58.478
No, you're stupid.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.443
Everything's gonna be okay now.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.627
- Damn, that girl looks
just like Hazel.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.964
- You two get lost.
Let me do my thing.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.554
God bless you, child.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.848
How are you doing today?

24:36.141 --> 24:39.019
Alice, my name is Judiff.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.520
I know who you are.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.689
I know that you were
once married to Greg Benson

24:42.772 --> 24:45.650
and that he hurt you.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.694
- You want to play dominoes?

24:47.777 --> 24:49.112
- Oh, sure.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.202
So, uh,

24:55.285 --> 24:57.829
are you in here
because of Byron?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.539
Did he put you in here?
- No.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.334
I put myself in here.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.212
It was the only place
I can be free from him.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.714
Far away from the Hub.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.175
- So you've been to the Hub?

25:10.258 --> 25:13.220
Can you tell me where it is?

25:13.303 --> 25:14.596
- Why would you ever want
to go there?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.890
- Alice, my friend Herb's
in trouble.

25:16.973 --> 25:20.602
I think he's trapped in there
along with his daughter, Hazel.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.065
- Hallelujah!
- Oh!

25:25.148 --> 25:26.775
- You are saved.
Um, praise him.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.526
- Mm-mm.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.662
Do you know who she is?

25:38.745 --> 25:40.747
- That looks like me.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.749
- Yeah, that's his wife.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.376
His latest wife.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.087
- He can be quite charming,
you know?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.217
Until you realize
that he just wants

25:52.300 --> 25:55.929
to control you
like his little pet.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.057
He's sick.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.725
- He put a chip in her head

26:00.809 --> 26:03.979
and has been watching
her every move.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.730
- Sounds like I got off easy.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.691
- Yeah.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.277
- I can't help you.
- What?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.112
- With Byron Gogol,
you'll never win.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.364
- No, no,
I'm not trying to win.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.199
I just want to help my friends.

26:16.283 --> 26:19.786
Don't you wish
someone had helped you?

26:19.869 --> 26:22.247
- I'm--I'm delusional.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.709
You're mistaken about me.
I've never met Byron Gogol.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.335
So...

26:34.509 --> 26:37.137
- Well, that was a waste
of days and miles.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.388
- Not a waste.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.432
This hot priest alter ego
really suits me.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.642
I want to keep going.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.311
- Okay, then.
Let's go home,

26:44.394 --> 26:46.688
crack open the files,
and research other angles.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.773
- Can we stop at the World's
Largest Peanut statue

26:48.857 --> 26:50.191
on the way?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.776
- No.
- Mm-mm, no.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.446
- Joke's on you, dumbasses.
I'm driving.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.185
- Okay, showtime.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.228
What do we got for tonight?

27:29.647 --> 27:32.484
- "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers."

27:32.567 --> 27:33.902
- Really?

27:33.985 --> 27:37.197
You don't think
it's a little, uh, too soon?

27:37.280 --> 27:40.784
Come on.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.040
It'll be funny.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.459
- Okay.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.393
Come on, I told you
it was a bad idea.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.061
Huh?
You're not even watching now.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.563
- No, no.
You mustn't go near him.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.856
- Look, I'm watching.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.236
- I love this.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.821
- Yeah.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.865
- What happened back there?

28:20.949 --> 28:23.535
- Um, I'm glad you're back,
Hazel.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.288
I was so worried.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.916
- Me too.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.460
- Don't scare me
like that again.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.713
- I won't.
Everything's gonna be okay now.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.926
I'm home.
