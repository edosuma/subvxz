Hey, you didn't tell me
that you had a new stalker.

00:41.691 --> 00:44.117
A stalker?
(gasps)

00:44.211 --> 00:46.436
I haven't had
one of those since '05.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.531
Maybe the good luck charm's
already working its magic.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.592
Maybe.

00:53.796 --> 00:54.869
What are you doing?

00:54.963 --> 00:56.055
Aren't we livestreaming?

00:56.206 --> 00:57.413
You teased an unboxing
the other day.

00:57.466 --> 00:58.782
Oh, no, no, no.
I look horrible.

00:58.784 --> 00:59.950
Besides, I can't wait.

01:00.043 --> 01:01.209
-(chuckles)
-We'll, um...

01:01.228 --> 01:02.286
we'll re-pack it and do it

-Where is this from again?
-Pompeii.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.091
It was used
in cleansing rituals.

01:32.242 --> 01:35.910
Right. The gods of Pompeii
are smiling on me.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.172
Wait, didn't
everybody die in Pompeii?

01:39.325 --> 01:41.174
Yes, but that survived.

01:41.327 --> 01:42.935
Uh, here, check it out.
It even has

01:43.086 --> 01:44.328
a certificate of authenticity.

01:44.421 --> 01:46.421
Hm, it's a piece of history.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.849
Huh. Well,

01:49.001 --> 01:51.426
I bought it. I guess it's

01:51.445 --> 01:53.153
"herstory" now.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.241
(screaming)

02:05.609 --> 02:07.442
Thank God you're here.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.461
Dispatch reported somebody
got hit by a chandelier?

02:09.613 --> 02:11.355
Uh, the cables must have
snapped or something.

02:11.373 --> 02:12.706
I-I don't know what happened.

02:12.858 --> 02:14.800
I-I tried moving it, but
it was so heavy and there was...

02:15.060 --> 02:16.376
there was so much blood.

02:16.453 --> 02:19.529
-Is she conscious?
-Yes. She-she won't shut up.

02:19.623 --> 02:20.788
Help!

02:20.808 --> 02:23.533
-Alexis, you left me.
-ALEXIS: To bring help!

02:23.627 --> 02:25.126
Just please get this thing
off of me.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Try not to move, okay?

02:26.872 --> 02:28.054
We're gonna get you
out of there.

02:28.207 --> 02:29.297
BOBBY:
All right, let's get a backboard

02:29.316 --> 02:30.874
-and gurney in here.
-Yeah, Cap, this thing's

02:30.893 --> 02:32.317
penetrated the floor
pretty deep.

02:32.469 --> 02:34.153
We're gonna have to
cut it apart, piece by piece.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.470
Buck, you're with me.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.197
Let's get saws
and Nomex blankets.

02:38.884 --> 02:40.409
CHIMNEY:
No sign of penetrating trauma.

02:41.645 --> 02:43.662
-Can you tell us your name?
-I-It's Felisa.

02:43.889 --> 02:45.055
Felisa Valdez?

02:45.224 --> 02:46.748
You know me.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.742
CHIMNEY: Oh, yeah.

02:48.894 --> 02:50.243
Hey. Nice to meet you.

02:50.396 --> 02:53.397
I would give you an autograph,
but... Ah...

02:53.490 --> 02:54.247
I can't...

02:54.400 --> 02:57.825
Um, i-is the bracelet okay?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.160
I'm more worried
about these cuts.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.754
Well, I could worry about both.
I spent

03:00.906 --> 03:02.181
20 grand on this thing.

03:02.332 --> 03:03.849
Supposed to be my lucky charm,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.258
but I don't know
if it's working.

03:05.411 --> 03:07.077
Okay, try to take
a deep breath for us.

03:07.095 --> 03:08.503
Can you tell us

03:08.522 --> 03:10.397
-where you feel pain?
-FELISA: Um...

03:12.008 --> 03:13.934
I don't...
I don't feel anything.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.269
Th-That's a good thing, right?
Or is that bad?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.513
One time, I was in a movie,
and my character couldn't

03:18.532 --> 03:20.032
feel anything because
she was cut in half.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.700
<i> When Time Stops.</i>
I saw that one.

03:21.851 --> 03:22.776
(Felisa chuckles)

03:22.928 --> 03:23.944
And, uh, don't worry,

03:24.096 --> 03:25.353
all your limbs
are accounted for.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.613
Just try to stay calm

03:26.765 --> 03:28.165
while we figure out
what's going on with you.

03:32.621 --> 03:35.881
-Eddie, how's the head
looking up there?
-Small laceration on occiput.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.791
Applying pressure
to stop the bleeding.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.276
She's bleeding from her occiput?

03:39.294 --> 03:41.127
The back of her head.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.870
Even the smallest cuts
tend to bleed a lot.

03:42.965 --> 03:44.056
CHIMNEY: What he means to say is

03:44.132 --> 03:46.391
it's not a huge cause
for concern.

03:48.545 --> 03:49.302
(laughs) Oh.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.954
All right. That's a good sign.

03:50.973 --> 03:52.213
Looks like somebody felt that.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.641
I mean, you're tickling my feet.
How could I not?

03:54.793 --> 03:57.051
Uh, what about this?

03:57.071 --> 04:00.739
A-Am I supposed to be
feeling something?

04:04.136 --> 04:05.302
Cap, reflex

04:05.471 --> 04:07.153
of the left leg could be
a potential spinal injury.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.248
Is s-something wrong?
She's not paralyzed, right?

04:09.475 --> 04:11.475
That would severely impact
her future revenue stream.

04:11.568 --> 04:13.252
-FELISA: Paralyzed?
-EDDIE: Maybe that's not

04:13.328 --> 04:15.645
the thing we're trying
to focus on right now.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.147
All right, Chim,
I want you to contact the ER.

04:17.165 --> 04:19.240
Buck, let's start
to saw it away from her.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.166
Carefully.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.002
(Buck grunts softly) Hi.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.004
This'll keep you
safe from the sparks, okay?

04:24.156 --> 04:26.723
-Uh, o-okay.
-There you go.

04:41.507 --> 04:44.841
-BOBBY:
On three. One, two, three.
-(grunts)

04:44.860 --> 04:47.077
(Felisa grunts)

04:49.364 --> 04:51.939
-(chandelier clatters)
-All right, Felisa,
how you feeling?

04:52.034 --> 04:53.350
Um, my left leg is tingling.

04:53.368 --> 04:54.960
Wait, that's a good thing,

04:55.187 --> 04:56.944
right? That means I can feel.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.204
It's very good,
yeah, it's probably

04:58.281 --> 05:00.448
a pinched nerve
or maybe a spinal bruise.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.192
Thank God. See?

05:02.210 --> 05:04.720
The bracelet's working,
just like I said it would.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.549
(siren wailing)

05:09.643 --> 05:11.217
Once I get this IV set,

05:11.312 --> 05:12.477
I'm gonna give you some Toradol.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.220
So, you say this thing's
a good luck charm.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.815
Why do you need it?
Seems like you have a good life.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.132
-(scoffs)
-ALEXIS: Uh,

05:18.301 --> 05:20.152
she's had a run
of really bad luck

05:20.303 --> 05:23.229
-for almost a decade.
-Um, it's called a curse.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.639
Curse?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.882
So, you spent 20K

05:25.901 --> 05:27.400
-on a bracelet?
-FELISA: Alexis is

05:27.477 --> 05:29.886
constantly looking for things
to turn my luck around.

05:29.905 --> 05:32.572
Let me guess--
nothing ever works?

05:32.724 --> 05:33.573
CHIMNEY: Don't mind Eddie.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.316
He's unnaturally resistant

05:35.336 --> 05:36.984
to anything supernatural.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.038
Prove to me something is real,
I'll believe in it.

05:40.265 --> 05:42.758
I feel you're confused
at the definition of belief.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.178
I mean, a chandelier fell on me.

05:46.405 --> 05:47.754
Doesn't that sound like a curse?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.997
Eh, might've just been
a freak accident.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.000
-Is there a difference?
-Only in Eddie's head.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.427
-I'll get you checked in.
-ALEXIS: Okay.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.097
Dimitri's coming tomorrow
to deal with the chandelier

05:57.191 --> 05:58.582
-and the floors.
-FELISA: Ugh.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.100
God only knows how much
that's gonna cost.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.602
Do you think the gods of Pompeii
will give me a refund?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.011
Stop being negative.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.031
The bracelet can't help
if you won't let it.

06:07.759 --> 06:08.867
Okay, they're gonna take you in

06:09.094 --> 06:11.018
for some scans.
Good luck, Felisa.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.329
Thank you.

06:14.099 --> 06:15.432
Hey, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:15.525 --> 06:17.100
That we should hit
that barbecue joint

06:17.119 --> 06:18.860
-around the corner? Yes.
-No, no, no.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.270
Something's up with those two.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.272
CHIMNEY: Felisa and
what's her face? What?

06:22.365 --> 06:25.609
Oh, is this about the curse?

06:25.702 --> 06:27.201
Curses aren't real.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.346
Oh, here we go again.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.226
(Athena laughs)

06:34.453 --> 06:36.544
All this food,
and that's all you're having?

06:36.563 --> 06:40.399
Uh, yeah. It's, um...
it's delicious.

06:42.477 --> 06:45.311
How did "the age of absolutely"
turn into alfalfa smoothies?

06:45.464 --> 06:46.630
-(sighs)
-CHIMNEY: Buck spends

06:46.648 --> 06:47.572
one minute with a celebrity,

06:47.649 --> 06:48.573
now he's drinking like them.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.409
ATHENA:
Which celebrity?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.576
Felisa Valdez.

06:51.728 --> 06:54.137
Oh, really? Mm.

06:54.156 --> 06:55.396
You don't sound like
much of a fan.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.973
What's the last thing
you saw her in?

06:57.066 --> 06:58.642
(chuckles)
In the back of my patrol car.

06:58.735 --> 07:00.085
Yeah, she tried to hit

07:00.162 --> 07:01.586
a paparazzi with her car

07:01.738 --> 07:02.812
and went to rehab.

07:02.906 --> 07:03.922
I can't say I missed her.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.573
HEN:
Who says they don't miss me?

07:05.742 --> 07:06.758
(all exclaim)

07:06.910 --> 07:08.668
CHIMNEY:
Not anyone here.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.654
-So, how's Karen?
-Great.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.505
I think she was
more excited for me

07:12.599 --> 07:15.175
to get back to work than I was.
(chuckles)

07:15.269 --> 07:17.102
Somehow, she says that I hover.

07:17.329 --> 07:19.938
-(laughing)
-What...

07:20.089 --> 07:22.089
Athena, what are you doing here?

07:22.184 --> 07:24.776
Oh, I wouldn't miss
your first day back.

07:24.928 --> 07:26.260
And Bobby here went all-out

07:26.280 --> 07:27.446
for your welcome-back breakfast.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.263
So, who's done
with their first round?

07:29.283 --> 07:32.284
I'm ready for my second round,
and it's about to get ugly.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.526
BUCK:
Yeah, I guess I'll, uh,

07:33.679 --> 07:34.661
grab some seconds, too.

07:34.771 --> 07:35.620
(chuckles) Yum.

07:35.772 --> 07:36.938
(Athena chuckling)

07:37.032 --> 07:40.041
What's with
the, uh, green juice?

07:40.702 --> 07:42.127
I don't know.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.614
Oh.

07:46.783 --> 07:47.857
Heard you're on a health kick?

07:47.876 --> 07:48.875
Uh, yeah.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.452
Can't a guy try
to take care of himself?

07:51.621 --> 07:53.472
(laughs) Buck,

07:53.623 --> 07:55.882
your idea of healthy
is a side salad.

07:56.034 --> 07:57.642
When did puréed greens

07:57.794 --> 07:59.478
become a whole main meal?

07:59.629 --> 08:00.979
Uh, well, since

08:01.130 --> 08:02.964
I agreed to be

08:02.983 --> 08:05.150
Connor and Kameron's
sperm donor.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.136
So, you're really doing it?

08:09.231 --> 08:11.564
I'm really doing it.
And-and I figure, if I am,

08:11.717 --> 08:13.066
I... I should do it right.

08:13.218 --> 08:15.685
You know, set them up with
the best chance for success.

08:15.687 --> 08:17.478
Ah, hence

08:17.498 --> 08:20.056
-the green juice.
-Ah, not just green juice.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.559
I'm abstaining from everything.

08:22.577 --> 08:23.868
Right? No alcohol,

08:24.095 --> 08:25.820
no junk food, red meat,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.397
fish that could be
too high in mercury.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.900
Mm, not sure swordfish has
an effect on your sperm count.

08:30.994 --> 08:33.828
No, I'm abstaining from

08:33.847 --> 08:36.072
other things to help with that.

08:36.132 --> 08:39.759
You know, I'm, uh,

08:47.602 --> 08:49.027
Uh-uh.

08:49.178 --> 08:50.770

08:50.922 --> 08:53.031
Longer than expected.

NATALIE:
I'm sorry, Mr. Buckley.

08:55.093 --> 08:56.442

they sent over

and when I came back in,

10:51.710 --> 10:53.543

-What? No way.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.050
This is her.
It's her bracelet.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.827
Felisa, this is
firefighter Diaz.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.979
We met at, yeah, at your house.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.331
CHIMNEY:
Heart rate's elevated.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.910
Felisa, panicking is only
gonna make things worse.

11:11.062 --> 11:13.338
I need you to stay relaxed.
You're in good hands, I promise.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.840
-We need to make an airway now.
-Pass me the scalpel.

11:15.992 --> 11:17.750
CHIMNEY:
It's coming up. Scalpel.

11:17.903 --> 11:19.402
(muffled grunting continues)

11:19.421 --> 11:21.096
Try to stay calm, Felisa.

11:25.911 --> 11:27.310
Hold on, hold on.

11:29.097 --> 11:30.914
-Is that...
-The wax. It made its way

11:31.082 --> 11:33.274
into her throat.
Oral airway.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.361
Few more seconds, Felisa.

11:36.588 --> 11:39.280
-All right.
-Almost there, almost there.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.370
O2 mask going on.

She's breathing.

11:54.439 --> 11:56.789
All right, so now what
do we do with the wax?

11:56.866 --> 11:58.532
EDDIE:
Looks like the warmer
was only set

11:58.626 --> 11:59.718
for 104 degrees.

11:59.869 --> 12:01.444
CHIMNEY:
Okay, so probably not major

12:01.463 --> 12:03.279
burns, since it's already
started to cool.

12:03.298 --> 12:04.964
I say we leave it
and let the hospital remove it.

12:05.116 --> 12:06.783
-(muffled scream)
-HEN: Okay.

12:06.801 --> 12:09.376
So, the wax stays on
just for a little while longer.

Oh, my God, Felisa!

12:15.718 --> 12:16.809

12:16.962 --> 12:18.144

-She will be,

12:20.131 --> 12:22.648
-as soon as we get her
to the hospital.
-Okay, I'm-I'm riding with her.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.075
You've been here
this whole time?

12:24.152 --> 12:26.745
I am her assistant.
I go everywhere with Felisa.

12:39.742 --> 12:42.318
NATALIE:
Yes. I-I am so sorry.
I understand.

12:42.411 --> 12:45.096
-It's a lot to go through.
-Oh, uh, hey. Sorry, excuse me.

12:45.248 --> 12:47.248
Um, I'm-I'm here

12:47.267 --> 12:50.084
Sorry. Building's lost power.
We'll have to reschedule.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.829
Uh, okay, h-how long
is it gonna be out?

12:52.847 --> 12:54.514
-I can wait.
-No idea.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.257
Um, sorry, not you.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.443
Sounds like they might take
the rest of the day.

12:58.594 --> 13:00.111
I'm sorry. I know

13:00.188 --> 13:01.521
you've had a run
of bad luck with us.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.172
Maybe I can-I can
come back tomorrow.

13:03.266 --> 13:05.099
-Yes, that's perfect.
-Great. What time?

13:05.176 --> 13:08.177
I'm sorry, not you.
Uh, first available is...

13:08.196 --> 13:09.436
a week from Tuesday.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.681
Does that work?

13:11.774 --> 13:14.125
Uh, yeah. Sure.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.087
Guess it's gonna have to.

13:19.524 --> 13:21.615
So, the bracelet was supposed
to change her luck?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.618
Feel like maybe it made
the bad luck more...

13:24.712 --> 13:26.095
apocalyptic.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.226
-Oh, no.
-What?

13:32.871 --> 13:34.887
That's that damn bracelet.

13:35.707 --> 13:38.191
Do you think it heard me
trash talking it?

13:38.301 --> 13:39.542
I don't think it has ears.

13:40.636 --> 13:43.696
CHIMNEY:
Must have fallen off going
to the ER. What should we do?

13:46.901 --> 13:47.992
Give her
her bracelet back.

13:48.144 --> 13:50.662
-Whoa!
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:51.832 --> 13:54.057
Just to be on the safe side.

13:54.150 --> 13:54.982
CHIMNEY:
Right.

13:55.076 --> 13:56.650
First rule of a curse,

13:56.744 --> 13:58.578
they spread like a virus.

13:58.654 --> 14:01.731
(scoffs)
You two are being ridiculous.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.766

14:03.826 --> 14:06.327
-Aah!
-BOBBY: Whoa!

14:06.421 --> 14:07.904
-Hey.
-CHIMNEY: I told you.

14:07.922 --> 14:10.682
-BOBBY: You okay?
-It's spreading.
-It's not.

14:12.501 --> 14:13.593
(groaning)

14:13.687 --> 14:15.311
What is that?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.190
Gasoline.

14:19.417 --> 14:22.101
Evacuate the firehouse now.

14:22.178 --> 14:25.238
-Definitely spreading!
-Definitely spreading.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.376
You think she's
taking advantage of her?

14:38.527 --> 14:41.270
Felisa said Alexis convinced her
to buy that bracelet.

14:41.289 --> 14:44.607
Supposed to be some artifact
from Pompeii.

14:44.626 --> 14:46.200
This? (laughs)

14:46.294 --> 14:49.779
My mother has costume jewelry
that looks better.

14:49.797 --> 14:51.464
Probably cost her less, too.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.375
That thing set Felisa back
20 grand.

14:54.469 --> 14:56.377
$20,000 for that?

14:56.471 --> 14:57.878
Didn't seem like
it was the first thing

14:57.972 --> 14:59.288
that Alexis had
convinced her to buy.

14:59.307 --> 15:02.383
(sighs)
You sound pretty sure of that.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.384
(sighs)

15:03.478 --> 15:05.294
When my<i> abuelo</i> died,

15:05.388 --> 15:07.739
my<i> abuela</i> had a hard time.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.390
You know, he'd passed suddenly,

15:09.484 --> 15:11.392
so they never had
a chance to say goodbye.

15:11.486 --> 15:13.819
She felt really bad about that.

15:13.972 --> 15:15.805
Went to visit her
on a summer break,

15:15.898 --> 15:19.325
and there was this... woman.

15:19.494 --> 15:20.585
Curandera.

15:20.736 --> 15:23.070
She was at the house
at least once a week.

15:23.164 --> 15:24.905
Lighting<i> velas,</i> saying prayers,

15:24.999 --> 15:27.574
promised my<i> abuela</i> that
she'd be able to speak

15:27.669 --> 15:28.742
to a husband she'd lost.

15:28.836 --> 15:30.670
Mm, and she never did.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.822
No. She never stopped trying.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.581
She also never stopped paying.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.100
Savings, life insurance.

15:36.252 --> 15:37.435
Every penny she had.

15:37.662 --> 15:40.329
My pops and Tía Pepa
had to bail her out.

15:40.348 --> 15:42.165
She almost lost her house.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.943
And that's why you don't
believe in curses.

15:45.094 --> 15:48.020
I understand believing in
something bigger than yourself,

15:48.173 --> 15:50.189
but if there's
a higher power out there, I...

15:50.341 --> 15:53.009
I don't think they're
making chandeliers fall

15:53.027 --> 15:55.528
or fuel connectors
on gas pumps break.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.013
The best grifters

15:57.106 --> 15:59.773
know how to play
on people's desperation.

15:59.851 --> 16:01.851
The more desperate a person is,

16:01.869 --> 16:04.687
the easier it becomes
to fool them.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.190
HALLIE:
Can I help you with something?

16:07.283 --> 16:09.875
FELISA:
Are any of these
specifically for good luck?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.303
What kind of luck?
Lucky in love?

16:12.496 --> 16:15.622
Finances?
Job opportunities?

16:15.717 --> 16:17.642
All of it.
Consider me

16:17.869 --> 16:19.644
a vibrational catastrophe.

16:19.871 --> 16:21.462
Let's start with some green jade

16:21.556 --> 16:22.981
and maybe some citrine.

16:23.132 --> 16:26.800
I have a couple of
beautiful pieces in the back.

16:26.894 --> 16:28.544
Let me grab them for you.

16:28.563 --> 16:29.562
Thank you,

16:29.656 --> 16:30.971
(soft chuckle)

16:31.733 --> 16:34.492
Okay. I talked to
the hospital administrator

16:34.719 --> 16:36.494
and they are going to do
a top-to-bottom search

16:36.645 --> 16:37.829
to find out what happened
to your bracelet.

16:38.056 --> 16:40.665
(sighs)
Why bother?

16:43.319 --> 16:45.670
Pretty sure I was more cursed
wearing that thing

16:45.821 --> 16:47.046
than I was before.

16:50.568 --> 16:54.178
Maybe that will cleanse
my energy.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.905
ALEXIS:
Amethyst?

16:55.998 --> 16:58.349
I don't think that's for luck.

16:58.576 --> 17:01.744
Hey, maybe we shouldn't
purchase any more decor items

17:01.837 --> 17:03.521
that could double as weapons.

17:03.748 --> 17:05.948
It's for protection.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.100
-Hey, do you see
a ladder anywhere?
-No!

17:08.194 --> 17:10.253
Don't even think about it.
I will go find someone.

17:10.271 --> 17:11.863
Just, please, wait.

17:12.014 --> 17:13.364

17:33.628 --> 17:34.610

17:34.703 --> 17:36.596

17:43.137 --> 17:44.729
Oh, my God.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.046
What happened?

17:46.066 --> 17:48.291
I heard screaming.
What's going on? (gasps)

17:48.309 --> 17:49.734

17:49.961 --> 17:51.235
-Call 911.

Do you feel...

18:13.426 --> 18:16.427
It's... weird.

18:21.175 --> 18:23.159
BOBBY:
Dispatch said they were
in contact with the caller.

18:23.177 --> 18:24.343
CHIMNEY:
Looks like they're
all unconscious.

18:24.495 --> 18:25.937
HEN:
I see at least four down.

18:26.088 --> 18:27.346
CHIMNEY:
They're breathing
but not responsive.

18:27.498 --> 18:29.273
BOBBY:
Buck, did you get
that gas turned off yet?

18:29.500 --> 18:31.033
Uh, Cap, there's nothing
to shut off.

18:31.093 --> 18:33.427
There's no gas line
to this building.

18:33.596 --> 18:34.428
Then what caused this?

18:34.522 --> 18:35.947
CHIMNEY:
I think I have an idea.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.673
Felisa Valdez.

18:37.692 --> 18:38.932
Again?

18:39.977 --> 18:41.935
BOBBY:
Okay, let's get everyone
out of here. Everyone out.

18:41.955 --> 18:45.514
HEN:
Cap, I think
you should see this.

18:45.608 --> 18:47.016
BOBBY:
How deep is it?

18:47.109 --> 18:48.793
Could be a potential
stomach puncture.

18:48.944 --> 18:51.170
What in the world happened here?

18:53.967 --> 18:57.135
-(gasps)
-CHIMNEY: Easy. Easy.
You're okay.

18:57.286 --> 19:00.680
Try to take some breaths.
That's it.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.124
-Did I pass out?
-Not just you.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.719
Everybody in that store
passed out.

19:06.871 --> 19:07.979
Wait...

19:08.130 --> 19:10.297
-Wait, where's Alexis?
-Still in the store,

19:10.466 --> 19:12.057
but we're gonna
get her out soon.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.709
Do you know
what happened to her?

19:13.728 --> 19:15.469
FELISA:
No, um...

19:16.156 --> 19:19.306
She went and talked
to the manager, and then...

19:19.400 --> 19:21.409
<i> BOBBY (on radio):</i>
<i> Chim, need you inside now.</i>

19:22.553 --> 19:24.645
Copy that, Cap.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.165
Backboard coming in.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.560
She was stabbed with
the crystal in the conservatory.

19:31.579 --> 19:33.337
Or the new age shop.

19:33.489 --> 19:35.231
No way you fall on this thing
and end up like this.

19:35.324 --> 19:39.177
Still doesn't explain
why everyone else passed out.

19:42.924 --> 19:45.758
-Wait.
-What are you doing?

19:45.910 --> 19:49.020
Calling for a consult.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.247
Oh!

19:51.265 --> 19:53.432
That poor girl.
I can't even look at that.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.194
Uh, well, I-I really
need you to. Okay?

19:56.421 --> 19:59.030
I-I have to know
what kind of crystal that is

19:59.181 --> 20:00.606
and if it's toxic.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.108
I wouldn't carry anything toxic.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.353
Ma'am, please just
look at the photo.

20:06.447 --> 20:07.854
(scoffs)

20:07.949 --> 20:09.432
BOBBY:
Marcasite?

20:09.434 --> 20:11.600
It's basically iron sulfide.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.285
Which, when combined
with stomach acid...

20:13.362 --> 20:14.937
Creates hydrogen sulfide,

20:15.030 --> 20:16.789
which would make
everyone pass out.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.942
Captain Nash, 118.
Please alert Trauma One

20:19.961 --> 20:21.201
we are bringing in
a young female.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.888
Possible impalement
to the stomach.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.631
Injury is likely producing

20:25.725 --> 20:28.451
hydrogen sulfide.
Please advise.

20:28.469 --> 20:30.544
Alexis!

20:30.638 --> 20:32.063
Can I go in there?

20:32.214 --> 20:34.139
Listen, I think
there's something you need

20:34.234 --> 20:35.791
to know about Alexis.

20:35.810 --> 20:36.976
Sh-She's gonna be okay, right?

20:37.128 --> 20:38.627
Please, you-you
have to take care of her.

20:38.646 --> 20:40.154
She's all I have.

20:43.559 --> 20:46.059
It's not safe for you
to travel in that ambulance.

20:46.153 --> 20:48.821
But you can see her later,
after you get checked out.

20:48.973 --> 20:51.415
Let's load her up, guys.

20:58.499 --> 21:00.666
So you still don't think
she's cursed?

21:00.835 --> 21:03.636
No, but I'm starting
to think I am.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.218
I don't need her attorney.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.604
I just want to talk
to Felisa privately.

21:14.181 --> 21:16.165
No, I'm not a fa...

21:16.183 --> 21:18.401
I'm with
the Los Angeles Fire Dep...

21:21.430 --> 21:22.855
So, her manager's a dead end.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.507
I thought you were
calling her agent.

21:24.525 --> 21:26.175
I tried him first.
He said he'd call back.

21:26.193 --> 21:28.677
I dated an agent once.
They never call back.

21:28.696 --> 21:30.329
Hey, guys, what...
(exclaims)

21:32.683 --> 21:34.517
What is that thing
still doing here?

21:34.535 --> 21:35.793
Okay, take it easy.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.128
Eddie is trying
to reach out to Felisa

21:37.279 --> 21:38.445
to give it back to her.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.614
Yeah?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.374
Well, try harder.

21:42.527 --> 21:43.375
What?

21:43.528 --> 21:44.802
I can see those
beady little eyes

21:44.953 --> 21:46.211
looking right through me.

21:47.048 --> 21:50.199
Listen, I'm-I'm starting
to think maybe

21:50.292 --> 21:51.383
Eddie has a point here.

21:51.536 --> 21:53.552
The accident
at the crystal shop--

21:53.704 --> 21:54.812
bracelet wasn't even there.

21:54.963 --> 21:56.647
HEN:
Hey, Buck, you got to...

21:56.724 --> 21:58.891
(exclaims) What is that thing
still doing here?

21:59.043 --> 22:01.210
Okay, we're not having
this conversation again.

22:01.303 --> 22:02.486
What-what is it
you want to say to Buck?

22:02.638 --> 22:05.639
Well, Connor and his wife,
they're here to see him.

22:05.716 --> 22:08.734
Connor, your ex-roommate?
What does he want?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.311
-Uh...
-How would I know?

22:11.331 --> 22:13.072
Nothing.
Uh, excuse me.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.582
Uh, I don't know.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.501
Can we please
do something about this

22:17.728 --> 22:19.170
before something else happens?

22:19.397 --> 22:21.246
Like, maybe the oven blows?

22:21.323 --> 22:23.841
Or the bathroom backs up
for the third time this week.

22:24.068 --> 22:27.053
-Thanks again, Diaz.
-Hmm?

22:28.589 --> 22:30.589
-Catch!
-(exclaims)

22:30.741 --> 22:32.266
(laughs)

22:35.930 --> 22:39.598
Uh, uh, hey,
is-is everything okay?

22:39.750 --> 22:40.766
That's what we wanted to know.

22:40.918 --> 22:42.193
We got this
very cryptic voicemail

22:42.420 --> 22:43.844
that you didn't
make your appointment

22:43.863 --> 22:44.845
at the fertility clinic.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.106
Uh, right. No, there...

22:47.258 --> 22:49.533
Yeah, the-there was
a, uh, a power outage.

22:49.685 --> 22:52.018
And we tried to call you
but you didn't pick up.

22:52.113 --> 22:54.205
Maybe I left it in my car.
It...

22:54.432 --> 22:55.539
it was-it was charging.
It's, uh...

22:55.766 --> 22:57.190
I know we asked a really big
favor of you.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.542
Probably too big.

22:58.769 --> 23:00.269
And it's-it's okay
if you're having doubts.

23:00.287 --> 23:02.438
-No, guys...
-You understand, if you
changed your mind,

23:02.456 --> 23:04.030
-we understand.
-We just can't really handle
the not knowing

23:04.125 --> 23:05.883
what's going on because,
you know, we keep imagining

23:05.918 --> 23:07.943
-the worst.
-And after everything
we've already been through,

23:07.962 --> 23:09.536
-honestly, it really
means a lot...
-Guy-Guys, hey, hey, stop.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.447
Listen to me.
I haven't changed my mind.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.282
Okay? I w-I want
to do this for you.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.060
I promise,
I will be your sperm donor.

23:16.287 --> 23:18.396
It's just been tough
to find an appointment

23:18.547 --> 23:20.064
with the clinic's hours,
my schedule here.

23:20.291 --> 23:23.401
No one... no one really knows
I'm doing this for you.

23:23.552 --> 23:27.405
-I don't think that's true.
-Uh...

23:27.632 --> 23:28.989
Anymore.

23:35.806 --> 23:37.397
And I want the tops of

23:37.417 --> 23:39.417
-all those vehicles cleaned.
-Oh, that's where
I left my turnout.

23:39.568 --> 23:40.584
-All of 'em cleaned.
-(alarm ringing)

23:40.736 --> 23:43.003
-After this call.
-Yeah, uh... Thank God.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.258
KAMERON:
I am so sorry.

23:47.409 --> 23:50.152
We're so sorry about
the misunderstanding.

23:50.171 --> 23:51.762
Oh, I hope we didn't
make this awkward for you.

23:51.914 --> 23:53.764
No, uh, don't worry,
I can handle

23:53.916 --> 23:54.990
whatever they have to say.

23:55.050 --> 23:57.660
Every-Everything.
I got to go.

23:57.678 --> 23:59.270
Uh, thanks, Buck.

24:13.027 --> 24:15.077
So, why...

24:16.438 --> 24:17.604
Did you...

24:18.365 --> 24:21.107
Okay, guys, this is Buck's
personal business,

24:21.127 --> 24:22.776
so I think
we should let it go.

24:22.870 --> 24:24.369
-You knew!
-How long have you known?

24:24.522 --> 24:27.590
More importantly, how long
you been holding out on us?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.028
Oh, looks like we're here.

24:33.047 --> 24:34.880
Let's go fight fires, guys!

24:35.032 --> 24:37.141
Stupid bracelet curse.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.480
Hey, thanks for meeting me here.

24:42.631 --> 24:44.890
-You said you found something?
-Yeah.

24:44.984 --> 24:45.891
I went to check out
the crystal shop.

24:46.043 --> 24:47.893
-It was weird as hell.
-Yeah.

24:48.045 --> 24:49.561
Five people in the store,
one gets stabbed,

24:49.714 --> 24:51.213
four others pass out
and no one sees anything?

24:51.306 --> 24:54.717
No, there were
six people at the shop.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.218
I checked the security camera.

24:56.311 --> 24:57.661
Any idea who this guy is?

24:57.888 --> 25:00.239
Well, the hat obscures his face,
but it turn out that

25:00.333 --> 25:01.499
that is not the first time

25:01.667 --> 25:04.059
that this guy has
shown up on the scene

25:04.152 --> 25:06.337
of one of Felisa's accidents.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.840
-EDDIE: That's the spa.
-Mm-hmm.

25:10.067 --> 25:12.826
And that's the same guy,
running out the shop

25:12.878 --> 25:15.087
right before the 911 call.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.256
You think he's working
with Alexis.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.743
He's causing the accidents
so Alexis can, what--

25:20.761 --> 25:22.186
cash in how?

25:22.413 --> 25:25.689
The bracelet that
Felisa said cost her 20,000--

25:25.841 --> 25:28.508
Alexis bought online for 11.

25:28.602 --> 25:30.569
(whistles)
That's one hell of a markup.

25:31.422 --> 25:34.073
I need to talk to Felisa.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.535
FELISA:
So I was thinking,
after all of this,

25:37.686 --> 25:39.019
we need a vacation.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.765
You know, like a girls trip.
How does that sound?

25:42.933 --> 25:46.118
(knock on door)

25:46.212 --> 25:47.603
Firefighter Diaz.

25:47.696 --> 25:49.746
What are you doing here?

25:49.899 --> 25:52.049
Just Eddie. We had a drop-off

25:52.276 --> 25:55.219
and I, um, want to
give this back to you.

25:56.038 --> 25:57.446
(scoffs quietly)

25:57.464 --> 26:00.707
Can't believe I thought
that was gonna change my luck.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.726
She almost died because of me.

26:02.878 --> 26:04.687
I don't think that's true.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.293
This doesn't prove anything.

26:11.386 --> 26:12.570
Alexis would never do anything
to hurt me. I mean,

26:12.797 --> 26:13.812
come on, you've met her.

26:13.981 --> 26:14.888
You know that
she wouldn't do that.

26:15.057 --> 26:15.906
I know you feel like she's

26:16.058 --> 26:17.608
the only one you can count on.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.909
Yeah, because she is.

26:19.061 --> 26:21.470
Okay?
Everyone else is gone.

26:21.563 --> 26:23.488
Dead, disappeared, or...

26:24.250 --> 26:26.584
...simply doesn't want
to talk to me ever again.

26:26.844 --> 26:27.751
She's all I have.

26:27.903 --> 26:29.420
ATHENA:
What about your family?

26:29.571 --> 26:31.755
My parents got a divorce
when I was 16.

26:31.907 --> 26:34.499
Got pretty nasty,
so I filed for emancipation.

26:34.652 --> 26:36.910
Last day I spoke to them
was the day the judge

26:36.929 --> 26:39.263
declared me legally an adult.

26:40.507 --> 26:42.766
I don't know why you think
Alexis would do this to me.

26:42.993 --> 26:45.844
She paid $11,000
for that bracelet.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.355
What'd she charge you again?

26:53.520 --> 26:55.595
All you guys have
are two grainy videos

26:55.615 --> 26:56.947
of two guys in hats.

26:57.099 --> 26:59.599
-It's just a coincidence.
-You know, you may be right.

26:59.693 --> 27:01.768
But if it isn't,
that man is still out there

27:01.862 --> 27:03.704
and you could be in danger.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.167
I can take care of myself.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.946
Think we're wrong here?

27:13.023 --> 27:16.449
You know what I believe in
even less than a curse?

27:16.618 --> 27:18.344
Coincidence.

27:28.797 --> 27:30.606
Thank you.

27:35.637 --> 27:37.696
Of course.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.383
I can take care of myself.

28:01.906 --> 28:04.423
I can take care of myself.

28:04.575 --> 28:05.741
Yes.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.726
(engine starts)

28:09.004 --> 28:10.729
Okay.

28:28.933 --> 28:32.167
Whoa, there, buddy.
Back off.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.622
Okay.
It's okay, Felisa.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.551
Don't let Eddie and that cop
get into your head.

28:40.702 --> 28:43.303
You're just being paranoid.

28:45.632 --> 28:48.967
Or not.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.710
(line ringing)

28:50.804 --> 28:52.621
<i> MADDIE: 911.</i>

28:52.639 --> 28:54.456
-What's your emergency?
<i> -FELISA: I'm driving in my car</i>

28:54.549 --> 28:56.716
and I think
somebody's following me.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.218
-What's your name?
<i> -Felisa Valdez.</i>

28:58.295 --> 29:00.645
I'm in a blue Vero Starfire
on Riverside Drive.

29:00.798 --> 29:02.647
<i> Why do you think someone</i>
<i> might be following you?</i>

29:02.800 --> 29:04.466
Because this police officer
came to see me and she said

29:04.559 --> 29:06.651
that I might be in danger
and I didn't believe her.

29:06.804 --> 29:08.136
Why didn't I believe her?

29:08.155 --> 29:10.230
Okay, Felisa,
I'm gonna route you

29:10.249 --> 29:11.898
to the nearest police station.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.399
Do you see the name
of a cross street?

29:13.419 --> 29:16.661
I'm just hitting Laurel Canyon,
just about to pass Colfax.

29:16.814 --> 29:19.314
MADDIE:
All units in the vicinity
of Riverside and Colfax

29:19.407 --> 29:22.167
be advised, possible
unwanted pursuit in progress.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.244
Vehicle is a blue Vero Starfire.

29:24.338 --> 29:25.596
<i>Victim's name is Felisa Valdez.</i>

29:25.747 --> 29:28.340
Oh, hell, no.

29:28.492 --> 29:31.510
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

29:31.662 --> 29:33.395

29:49.696 --> 29:51.288

29:54.685 --> 29:56.335
-No!
-(exclaims)

29:59.799 --> 30:02.591
(sirens approaching)

30:11.051 --> 30:12.551
Don't move.

30:12.627 --> 30:14.603
Detain this man.

30:17.266 --> 30:19.149
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

30:19.301 --> 30:22.044
The victim's car
has been covered... (coughs)

30:22.062 --> 30:24.470
in asphalt.

30:24.565 --> 30:26.139
I need fire and rescue

30:26.233 --> 30:27.732
at Riverside...
(coughs)

30:27.885 --> 30:29.976
near the equestrian center.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.329
(coughing)

30:32.480 --> 30:34.248

30:36.669 --> 30:37.726
Oh, God.

30:37.744 --> 30:40.504

30:40.655 --> 30:42.564
ATHENA:
Felisa, hang on!

30:42.657 --> 30:43.732
Help! Help!

30:43.734 --> 30:45.658
-I'm in here!
-Help is coming.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.511
I can't breathe!
(coughs)

30:47.662 --> 30:50.305
Felisa, help is here.

30:54.745 --> 30:55.686
I couldn't get to her.

30:55.913 --> 30:58.747
And this asphalt is hardening.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.399
It's Felisa Valdez.

31:01.585 --> 31:02.860
We have any kind
of status on her?

31:03.011 --> 31:04.436
She was talking to Dispatch,

31:04.530 --> 31:06.771
but these fumes
are pretty brutal.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.107
Okay, let's get all the air
bottles we've got on standby.

31:09.259 --> 31:11.276
Eddie, Buck, I want you guys
to get some rubbish hooks

31:11.370 --> 31:13.704
into this asphalt.
How much longer do you think

31:13.855 --> 31:15.539
she has in there, Hen, Chim?

31:15.690 --> 31:17.782
Adrenaline is probably causing
her heart rate to rise,

31:17.877 --> 31:20.769
which means she's taking in
more oxygen every... (coughs)

31:20.787 --> 31:21.937
every minute.

31:22.030 --> 31:22.862
We need to buy her
some more time,

31:22.882 --> 31:23.788
get some air in there.

31:23.941 --> 31:26.008
(Hen clears throat)

31:28.779 --> 31:29.628
(coughing)

31:29.780 --> 31:32.306
Okay, we can work with this.

31:36.378 --> 31:39.971
Felisa, open the back panel
and get in the trunk.

31:40.124 --> 31:42.149
(coughs)

31:44.795 --> 31:47.129
-Hen, O2.
-(coughs)

31:47.147 --> 31:49.573
(oxygen hissing)

31:49.800 --> 31:51.557
-BOBBY: Any progress?
-No.

31:51.652 --> 31:53.318
Hardly making a dent.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.996
Think I have a better idea.

32:03.071 --> 32:04.904
(panting)

32:04.998 --> 32:08.333
Felisa, we're sending you
some air. Okay?

32:08.485 --> 32:11.962
If you can, reach back.
You may be able to grab it.

32:12.114 --> 32:13.004
I can't.

32:13.173 --> 32:17.100
Just try for me.
Move a little closer.

32:17.327 --> 32:19.511
It's too... it's too far.

32:19.663 --> 32:21.313
(coughs)

32:45.297 --> 32:47.381
(coughing)

32:49.635 --> 32:52.135

-EDDIE: Yeah.
-BOBBY: Get that gurney

33:00.220 --> 33:01.219
-in here.
-Let's go.

33:01.371 --> 33:03.355
-Easy.
-(Felisa coughing)

33:08.654 --> 33:10.153
Steady.

33:13.717 --> 33:15.283
Here we go.

33:24.561 --> 33:27.671
-How is she?
-Lucky to be alive.

33:27.822 --> 33:28.821
Who's that?

33:28.841 --> 33:30.899
ATHENA:
Oh, he chased her.

33:30.917 --> 33:33.418
Looks a lot like the man
from the security camera

33:33.570 --> 33:35.161
from the crystal shop
and the spa.

33:35.255 --> 33:37.180
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

33:37.332 --> 33:39.266
You mean it wasn't a curse?

33:41.094 --> 33:42.594
Again, sorry.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.646
Can you tell me
where the bracelet is?

33:49.102 --> 33:51.436
-Ow!
-Oh...

33:51.588 --> 33:53.280
OFFICER:
Get in.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.116
EDDIE:
Look at that.

33:57.018 --> 33:59.161
I think you broke your curse.

34:21.709 --> 34:23.060
Explain.

34:23.136 --> 34:24.619
She clicked the box.

34:24.712 --> 34:26.063
Excuse me?

34:26.214 --> 34:29.474
On the site,
there's a little box:

34:29.626 --> 34:31.976
"terms and conditions."

34:32.053 --> 34:33.812
She checked "I accept."

34:33.964 --> 34:36.073
She should have known
this would happen.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.484
I'm gonna need
a little more here.

34:39.636 --> 34:42.704
Why don't you start
with your name.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.156
<i> BUCK:</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:48.643
-That sounds made up.

34:48.662 --> 34:50.236
Nicholas Perelli
owns and operates

34:53.592 --> 34:54.999

34:55.094 --> 34:57.910

ancient artifacts.

34:58.004 --> 35:01.581
And he sells them
to unsuspecting collectors.

35:01.675 --> 35:04.159
Why was he so desperate
to get the bracelet back?

35:04.177 --> 35:06.085
I mean, a celebrity
bought one of his pieces.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.829
You'd think that
he'd welcome the publicity.

35:07.848 --> 35:11.090
Well, with publicity comes
scrutiny from people like me.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.776
Nico wasn't telling
his customers that

35:12.927 --> 35:14.185
they were buying forgeries.

35:14.338 --> 35:17.172
Anyways, we are so excited
to show you guys,

35:17.190 --> 35:19.599
so please stay tuned
for the unboxing,

35:19.618 --> 35:21.860
<i> and peace and blessings.</i>

35:21.954 --> 35:24.788
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> So, when Felisa</i>
<i> started talking about</i>

35:24.957 --> 35:27.015
how she was gonna
do a live unboxing...

35:27.033 --> 35:27.866
(grunts)

35:28.018 --> 35:28.941
...he panicked.

35:29.077 --> 35:30.794
How many other bracelets
were recovered

35:31.021 --> 35:32.111
from the ruins of Pompeii?

35:32.131 --> 35:34.113
-Twenty-seven.
-CHIMNEY: Those guys

35:34.133 --> 35:35.448
figure how much
they paid for a fake,

35:35.467 --> 35:38.360
they're coming for him,
and that's all she wrote.

35:38.378 --> 35:39.861
Why is it never
"that's all<i> he</i> wrote"?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.546
I don't make the rules, Hen.

35:41.698 --> 35:42.806
Anyway, so Nico had to

35:42.957 --> 35:45.049
<i> get it back</i>
<i> before the unboxing.</i>

35:45.202 --> 35:46.476
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> Yeah, he was hoping</i>
<i> to intercept it</i>

35:46.628 --> 35:49.371
<i> before it was delivered,</i>
<i> but Alexis</i>

35:49.389 --> 35:50.963
was already outside waiting.

35:50.983 --> 35:54.151
So he started following Felisa
looking for his next chance.

35:54.302 --> 35:55.877
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> When the aesthetician left,</i>

35:55.896 --> 35:57.896

35:57.990 --> 36:00.048
<i> But, needless to say,</i>

36:00.141 --> 36:03.160

Willow? Is that you?

36:16.733 --> 36:18.282
(screaming)

36:18.343 --> 36:19.659
Because she was also
screaming.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.753
<i> Loudly. If anyone</i>

36:21.847 --> 36:23.829
saw him running out
with the bracelet,

36:23.849 --> 36:26.925
he'd have been arrested before
he could make it to LAX.

36:27.077 --> 36:30.245
And the bracelet ends up
in an LAPD evidence locker.

36:30.263 --> 36:32.004
And it's a celebrity robbery,
so, news at 11:00.

36:32.098 --> 36:34.599
So the crystal shop
was his third attempt

36:34.751 --> 36:35.692
at getting it back.

36:35.919 --> 36:36.751

36:42.108 --> 36:43.758
The bracelet.
Where is it?

You were across the street
at Felisa's.

36:44.945 --> 36:46.978
What do you care
about the bracelet?

36:47.130 --> 36:48.930
I care that you bought it
for a celebrity

36:49.023 --> 36:50.432
and posted it all over
social media.

36:50.525 --> 36:52.525
Wait, you're here from that
website, Artifact Overstock?

36:52.619 --> 36:54.026
Yes. And I know
you have the bracelet,

36:54.120 --> 36:56.454

-No, no... (grunting)

Let's go and get
some real food.

37:27.471 --> 37:30.138

-Mm.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.581

37:49.601 --> 37:51.250
Alexis said that Nico
was outside at the time,

37:51.419 --> 37:53.661
so there's no way he could have
been responsible for that.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.089
The chandelier was probably
installed poorly.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.334
Yeah. And then it just fell

37:59.352 --> 38:02.279
as she put on
an artifact that supposedly

38:02.430 --> 38:05.006
came from the ruins of Pompeii.

40:26.149 --> 40:27.573
I didn't think you were
actually gonna show.

40:27.742 --> 40:29.074
You know, I wasn't going to,

40:29.094 --> 40:31.744
but I figured
you did save my life,

40:31.763 --> 40:33.004
like, multiple times, so...

40:33.098 --> 40:35.748
-(chuckles) Take a seat.
-So...

40:35.767 --> 40:37.750
figured I owed you.

40:37.844 --> 40:39.827
So, how's Alexis?

40:39.846 --> 40:41.829
They're releasing her tomorrow.

40:41.848 --> 40:43.848
She's gonna come stay with me.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.775
Did you talk to her
about the money?

40:46.002 --> 40:48.169
I don't care about that.

40:48.188 --> 40:51.114
-But she's stealing from you.
-Maybe she's earned it.

40:51.341 --> 40:53.357
I mean, you know who I am.

40:54.678 --> 40:56.844
So I'm sure you've heard
the stories of who I used to be.

40:56.938 --> 40:59.122
You know,
the trouble I'd get in,

40:59.273 --> 41:01.106
the DUIs, the arrests.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.535
The friends who OD'd
in my bathroom.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.278
That kind of loss...

41:06.298 --> 41:09.257
I mean, I don't know what else
you'd call it but curse.

41:12.696 --> 41:15.713
My wife died, uh,
it was three years ago.

41:16.475 --> 41:18.808
Six months later,
my son was on a pier

41:19.035 --> 41:21.293
when the tsunami hit.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.538
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.798
He survived.
That's actually him right there.

41:25.892 --> 41:28.042
-Christopher! Hey.
-Yeah?

41:28.211 --> 41:29.301
(both chuckle)

41:29.395 --> 41:32.046
He almost died in this ocean.

41:32.139 --> 41:33.548
Poor kid.

41:33.608 --> 41:35.399
Must have been terrifying.

41:35.552 --> 41:36.567
Yeah, it was.

41:36.661 --> 41:40.205
He was scared for a long time.
We both were.

41:41.725 --> 41:43.148
Well, you wouldn't know it now.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.336
The day the beach reopened,
we came here.

41:46.563 --> 41:49.397
I mean, the longer
we stayed away from the water,

41:49.490 --> 41:50.748
the more the fear would grow.

41:51.510 --> 41:55.261
I never wanted the ocean to have
that kind of power over him.

41:59.518 --> 42:02.744
You know, sometimes it's easier
to believe that you're cursed

42:02.837 --> 42:03.745
than believe you're wrong.

42:03.763 --> 42:05.747
Felisa.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.749
I'm gonna get going.

42:07.767 --> 42:10.476
I'm getting the house blessed
before Alexis gets home.

42:10.587 --> 42:12.253
I know, I know,
it sounds silly, but...

42:12.272 --> 42:14.572
Hey, if it works for you.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.534
Take care of yourself, okay?

42:17.685 --> 42:19.443
You too.

42:19.596 --> 42:21.371
-Bye.
-Bye.

42:21.598 --> 42:23.706
(indistinct chatter)

42:28.104 --> 42:31.789
(laughs)
Oh, did you see that?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.275
-(laughing)
-BOY: I'll go next time.

42:34.294 --> 42:36.678
(chatter continuing)

42:38.890 --> 42:41.057
<i> Hola, Abuela.</i>
<i> ¿Como estas?</i>

42:42.227 --> 42:44.969
No, everything's fine.
I was just

42:45.138 --> 42:46.712
thinking of you.

42:46.806 --> 42:49.649
Wanted to know how you were.

42:50.885 --> 42:53.236
Oh, yeah?
Tarot cards? That's new.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.157
So, what'd she have to say
about my future?

43:05.975 --> 43:08.751
