I'm not seeing or hearing

00:26.425 --> 00:28.795
any survivors
under the rubble.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.631
And the deceased
are all Thanagarian.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.767
-No parademons.
-TALAK: Parademons?

00:33.798 --> 00:35.600
(SCOFFS) There's no evidence

00:35.634 --> 00:37.804
this was done by
any Apokaliptan
(SPEAKS ALIEN WORD).

00:37.838 --> 00:41.975
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
the ring won't translate
that last word, but...

00:42.009 --> 00:45.645
-I can tell you what it means.
-I got the gist. Thank you.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.679
Commander Talak,

00:47.713 --> 00:50.783
this Nth metal refinery
fits the profile
of other facilities

00:50.817 --> 00:52.886
raided by parademons
on several planets.

00:52.917 --> 00:55.121
Yet the attack pattern here
is different.

00:55.155 --> 00:58.024
I don't see the usual evidence
of parademon weapons fire.

00:58.057 --> 01:01.493
And the Javelin detected
no trace of Boom Tube activity
in the area.

01:01.527 --> 01:04.197
I assume your scans confirm
the Nth metal stockpiles here
have been--

01:04.230 --> 01:07.167
Been stolen, yes,
Lieutenant Thal.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.436
But the theft
of a common element
is the least of our concerns.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.141
Sir, Nth metal
is only common on Thanagar.

01:14.174 --> 01:18.212
And thus Apokalips checks
another rare raw material
off its grocery list.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.444
As I said, Captain Hol,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.250
there's no evidence this was
an Apokaliptan attack.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.019
Our scans have only detected
earthling bio signs.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.489
But fortunately
for your friends,

01:29.522 --> 01:31.656
not their bio signs.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.060
You've been scanning us?

01:33.093 --> 01:36.028
(CHUCKLES) Smart.
Trust no one.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.197
Certainly not earthlings.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.134
Sir, we sent you the evidence.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.837
Earth meta-humans
are being kidnapped off planet

01:43.870 --> 01:46.105
for use by Apokaliptan forces.

01:46.138 --> 01:47.673
The metas are mind-controlled

01:47.674 --> 01:49.974
into violent action.
We've seen it.

01:49.974 --> 01:52.245
Then, perhaps we should
send a hawk fleet

01:52.278 --> 01:54.846
to quarantine Earth's populus

01:54.881 --> 01:57.117
since the task
is clearly too difficult

01:57.150 --> 02:01.188
for certain officers
and their human sidekicks.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.489
Don't call us sidekicks.

apology tour.

02:15.133 --> 02:18.872
You claim then,
that you and Lieutenant Thal
were mind-controlled

02:18.905 --> 02:21.139
into violent acts on Rimbor.

02:21.174 --> 02:25.276
Thanagar is still working
to repair our reputation from that.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.848
And now that Thanagar itself
falls victim to human attack,

02:28.882 --> 02:31.717
look who shows up
to sing a reprieve.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.818
-Commander--
-TALAK: You're done here.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.353

Relax. While you were
squawking with

02:49.336 --> 02:51.537
I did some scanning of my own.

02:51.568 --> 02:53.173
Boom Tubes
may have left no trace

02:53.205 --> 02:56.276
but I found an ion trail
from the attacker's ship.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.877
They flew away
on their own power,

02:58.912 --> 03:02.715
meaning, they screwed up,
and we have a new lead.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.651
You kinda want to
kiss the ring now, don't you?

03:04.651 --> 03:06.116
Little bit?
Kinda want to kiss the ring?

03:06.116 --> 03:07.854
Come on! Somebody kiss it.

VIOLET: I cannot believe
this is your first

03:51.764 --> 03:54.834
An entire meal wrapped

03:54.866 --> 03:57.169
pure enjoyment

My sister and I
were raised in a castle where

04:01.108 --> 04:04.842
eating with one's hands
was not encouraged.

04:04.842 --> 04:06.679
(CHUCKLES) I guess
then you only ate

04:06.711 --> 04:09.149
with those silver spoons
you were born with, huh?

04:09.181 --> 04:12.883
Hmm. And your life
with your eminent
scientist father

04:12.919 --> 04:14.955
was one of economic hardship?

04:14.985 --> 04:16.855
Uh, no.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.293
Maybe this would be
a good time to get to it.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.295
Listen, you've all
reached a crossroads.

04:22.329 --> 04:26.199
Vic, you have
your own decisions to make.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.269
But Brion, Tara,
Violet, Forager,

04:29.302 --> 04:30.903
we feel the four of you

04:30.937 --> 04:32.771
are ready to work
with the Justice League's

04:32.805 --> 04:34.908

to help mankind.

04:34.939 --> 04:36.875
But being a hero
isn't for everyone.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.278
This a choice you each have
to make for yourself.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.848
And the decision you make now
doesn't have to be
a permanent one.

04:41.879 --> 04:44.184
ARTEMIS: No judgement
from us either way.

04:44.216 --> 04:46.286
You've already
risked your lives
for each other

04:46.319 --> 04:50.122
and for the meta-teens
we rescued in Bialya.
That's enough.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.891
I've made my choice.

04:51.925 --> 04:55.095
And Bialya has proven
I made the right one.

04:55.127 --> 04:57.930
To protect the innocent,
no matter the danger.

04:57.963 --> 05:01.233
But facing danger
isn't a mandatory part
of our mission.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.870
Troia of Themyscira
and Garth of Atlantis

05:03.903 --> 05:05.305
both left the front lines.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.939
Now they fight the good fight
inside the system

05:07.973 --> 05:10.009

to the United Nations.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.079

there is no shame
in leaving this life behind.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.192

05:29.396 --> 05:31.064

05:31.096 --> 05:34.334
came back to the life
and sacrificed everything,

05:34.367 --> 05:36.336
so we could all be here today,

05:36.370 --> 05:39.038
at the ruins
of our former headquarters.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.473

05:40.507 --> 05:43.410
Another sacrifice made
for the greater good.

05:43.442 --> 05:46.980
So, the three of us
live with the consequences
of these sacrifices.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.982
We stand for those
who have fallen

05:49.014 --> 05:50.983
and we fight for those
who can't.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.252
That's our choice.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.721
But it doesn't
have to be yours.

After extensive investigation,

<i>known as Goode VR goggles</i>

<i>is part of a major

<i>These devices
secretly test users

06:16.910 --> 06:19.211
<i>Subliminal messages

06:19.245 --> 06:21.281
<i>direct victims
to discreet locations</i>

<i>for abduction,
meta gene activation,
and enslavement.</i>

06:25.117 --> 06:27.853
<i>New meta-humans

06:27.887 --> 06:30.456
<i>on the black market

<i>To save lives

06:33.891 --> 06:37.829

<i>for their role

06:52.076 --> 06:54.848
<i>Yes, the League

06:54.879 --> 06:57.117
<i>which they've since
dumped in Taos.</i>

06:57.149 --> 07:01.855
<i>But since these heroes
failed to coordinate
with local authorities,</i>

07:01.887 --> 07:06.459

11:40.567 --> 11:42.567
Kid Flash, Static and Thirteen

11:42.600 --> 11:45.205
will be glad
to have reinforcements.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.778
And, personally,

11:46.778 --> 11:49.206
I am thrilled
we have another alien
on the team.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.811
And two more girls.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.546
We're keeping pace.

11:52.576 --> 11:54.748
More girls...

11:55.883 --> 11:58.081
I have given thought to this.

11:58.115 --> 12:00.086
Despite my outward appearance,

12:00.119 --> 12:03.490
I do not know
that I am a girl or a boy

12:03.523 --> 12:05.557
as Earth languages
define the words.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.394
Yeah, but your soul,
it's from...

12:08.427 --> 12:09.696
A Mother Box.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.663
An approximate
English translation

12:11.697 --> 12:14.533
of the New Genesian word
for what I was.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.403
But what I am now

12:16.436 --> 12:18.269
is just me.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.572
Is that okay?

12:23.408 --> 12:24.745
Beyond okay.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.115
Oh, but I'm sorry.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.216
I interrupted your briefing.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.850
It's fine.

12:32.884 --> 12:36.706
I'm truly thrilled
you're discovering
who you are inside.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.125
Plus, there's more good news.

12:40.158 --> 12:43.129
Superboy and Tigress
are rejoining the team.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.764
Keeping an eye on us?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.831

you've thought this through?

12:53.874 --> 12:56.475
Yeah. I want back on the team.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.644
We were just
noting the buzz online.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.812
Gorilla heroics
got the itch scratchin', huh?

13:00.846 --> 13:02.413
It's more than that.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.716
I put Gretchen Goode
on notice.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.350
She might have me locked
into an acting contract,

13:07.384 --> 13:09.355
but she doesn't control
my off hours.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.691
And I'm here
to help take her down.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.225
We don't have
any leads on Goode yet.

13:14.259 --> 13:17.397
But you're always
welcome on the team,
little brother.

13:17.427 --> 13:19.432
Can't send you
on every stealth mission,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.600
your powers
are too recognizable.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.336
But I'll juggle assignments
to keep you

13:23.370 --> 13:25.806
as busy as you want to be.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.475
Looks like your team
just doubled in size.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.711
Good. We need
all the help we can get.

-Oh, speaking of help.

<i>Despite Lex Luthor's
short-sighted views</i>

13:39.384 --> 13:42.620

13:42.653 --> 13:44.456
<i>Decisions by

13:51.764 --> 13:56.403

<i>And the committee

13:58.705 --> 13:59.907

13:59.940 --> 14:01.908

<i>Really, Lex Luthor,</i>

14:08.815 --> 14:12.552
<i>how do you find the time

14:18.355 --> 14:20.393
<i>It is exhausting, G. Gordon.</i>

14:20.427 --> 14:22.293

14:24.697 --> 14:28.500
<i>Certainly the League sees
the difference between

14:28.533 --> 14:31.370
<i>We need accountability

14:36.543 --> 14:39.009
<i>So, we watch the Watchtower,</i>

14:39.046 --> 14:42.315

14:42.346 --> 14:45.317
<i>Even your own LexCorp

14:45.350 --> 14:47.384
<i>Of course.</i>

14:47.418 --> 14:50.023
<i>To avoid

But my dear Barda,

15:37.971 --> 15:39.739
that cannot be correct.

Not when we have
a clear policy of Boom Tubing

15:42.774 --> 15:45.509

from all raid sites.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.947

16:18.009 --> 16:20.446
that wasn't torture, Desaad.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.447
It was discipline.
