WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.571
[general conversations]

00:04.637 --> 00:06.639
...we're basically done,
we're just at tweaks,

00:06.706 --> 00:08.408
but really happy
with how it's going.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.310
Hey, is that
Dr. Greenblatt?

00:10.377 --> 00:14.414
Oh, yeah, yeah, that is.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.649
Wow... wow, wow!

00:16.716 --> 00:18.118
Oh, my God.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.853
I thought he was married.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.853
Yeah, for like, 20 years.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.888
Well, he's either divorced
or having an affair,

00:21.955 --> 00:24.190
which isn't that pretty
much everyone these days?

00:24.257 --> 00:25.725
No, we're not.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.861
You don't know me.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.861
I know we're not divorced.

00:27.927 --> 00:30.764
Well, do you?

00:27.927 --> 00:30.764
Yeah, just keep looking left.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.466
All right, all about the left,
all about the left.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.235
Oh, I'm in a situation
on the left,

00:35.301 --> 00:36.403
I'm going to
have to swing right.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.405
Andrea, Mike, hey, hi.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.306
Oh, my God!
Dr. Greenblatt!

00:40.373 --> 00:41.341
Hey, I thought
it was you two.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.809
I didn't recognize you

00:42.876 --> 00:44.711
without you jamming
your fingers in my mouth.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.713
Oh, sorry, I can do that
now if you'd like.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.248
[laughing]

00:46.780 --> 00:48.248
Hi!

00:48.314 --> 00:51.451
We're patients of your...

00:51.518 --> 00:53.052
This is my wife, Vicki.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.021
I'm sure I've gushed about
her to you over the years.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.823
It's nice to finally meet
Vicki the wife.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.358
Nice to meet you.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.358
Are you guys celebrating

00:58.425 --> 00:59.692
an anniversary or something?

00:59.759 --> 01:02.595
No, no, we're just out
for a quick bite.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.063
Tuesday.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.063
Oh.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.632
You want to sit?

01:04.130 --> 01:05.632
Oh, no, no.

01:05.698 --> 01:06.866
We'll let you get back
to your dinner.

01:06.933 --> 01:08.034
Okay.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.336
So nice to meet you,
and so nice to see you.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.138
I recommend
the creme brulee,

01:12.205 --> 01:14.107
mostly because I want to
see you two more often.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.576
Ah... ah-ha, okay.

01:16.643 --> 01:20.647
Oh, we will keep flossing.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.185
[whispering]
That is his wife.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.121
Oh, fuck you.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.991
â™ª

01:44.737 --> 01:47.006
I can't make up my mind if it
was weird they were making out,

01:47.073 --> 01:48.741
or weird that
it was in public.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.910
Oh, it was weird
that it was in public.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.712
We've never been
those people.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.314
And we're, like,
happily married

01:54.380 --> 01:56.850
and we're still totes horns
for each other, right?

01:56.916 --> 01:58.718
We are totes horns.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.487
Even my therapist says,
by the way, very rare.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.622
We have sex, like, three times
a week, that's a lot.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.225
We have sex two times a week.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.225
You don't know what I do.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.060
I know exactly how many
times we've had sex.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.828
It does bring up
an interesting point, though.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.531
When was the last time just,
like, we made out?

02:11.598 --> 02:13.333
We made out three days ago.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.969
That was for, like, five seconds
and led right into sex,

02:16.035 --> 02:17.303
that's not making out.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.738
What do you mean by
"just make out"?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.206
I'm talking about make out.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.609
I'm talking about, like,
there's no goal in mind,

02:22.675 --> 02:27.680
we take our time, and it's just
being in each other's mouths.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.349
Oof, that makes me sick.

02:29.415 --> 02:32.552
It's like our tongues are
resting on each other's tongues

02:32.619 --> 02:35.588
and we settle into
just tongue on tongue.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.956
Just, like, a real
good make out.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.225
This is ruining
kissing for me forever.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.628
I feel like you just need
to experience it anew.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.296
Do you want to be
make out people?

02:43.363 --> 02:45.298
No, I'm not saying I want
to be make out people.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.834
I just want to know if other
people are, like, going around,

02:47.901 --> 02:51.437
behind closed doors,
doing stuff like this.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.740
Stuff like being
affectionate and intimate?

02:53.806 --> 02:55.708
Yeah, exactly, because
I'll get pitchforks

02:55.775 --> 02:57.577
and I will run them
out of their homes.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.178
They can't act like that.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.481
I love it, though, I feel
like old Dr. Greenblatt

03:01.548 --> 03:04.751
was really just kind of, like,
showing off in front of us.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.553
I don't know if I'd
go back to him

03:06.619 --> 03:07.987
after his behavior tonight.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.023
It does kind of make him
seem kind of like a pervert.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.724
Do you think so?

03:11.791 --> 03:13.927
[gasps], now I want
to go back to him.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.896
Like "Sophie's Choice,"
I choose pervert.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.465
That's later.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.434
Okay, so it's a first date,
they're having a good time,

03:21.501 --> 03:24.270
I mean, Lori's suspicious,
but she's into him.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.539
Christopher walks her to her
car, you think it's going to be

03:26.606 --> 03:29.008
the big first kiss moment,
he leans in and he says,

03:29.075 --> 03:30.577
"Can I get a blowjob?"

03:30.643 --> 03:31.978
Yeah, I like it, I like it.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.147
But we should have him ask
for a handjob.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.715
Why would he ask
for a handjob?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.151
Because asking for
a handjob is just creepier.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.919
Yeah, but it's so much
easier to do.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.721
A blowjob would be
a bigger ask.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.189
But that's the common ask.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.525
A handjob, you can
give yourself a handjob,

03:45.592 --> 03:47.360
so to be asking someone
to give it to you.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, you can't.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.598
You can't give
yourself a handjob?

03:51.664 --> 03:53.066
No, you can jerk
yourself off,

03:53.132 --> 03:54.934
you can't give
yourself a handjob.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.936
A handjob is a job
for another person.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.304
Why?

03:57.003 --> 03:58.304
It's the same reason

03:58.371 --> 04:00.006
you can't tickle yourself.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.341
Some people sit on their hand,

04:01.407 --> 04:03.176
wait for it to go numb
and then jerk off.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.211
You didn't say,
"some people sit on their hand,

04:05.278 --> 04:08.214
take their hand out and
give themselves a handjob."

04:08.281 --> 04:10.416
Okay, regardless, though,
if I was on a first date,

04:10.483 --> 04:13.753
a guy asks for a blowjob,
I'd be like, ugh, annoyed.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.388
But if he asked for a handjob?

04:15.455 --> 04:18.291
But if it's a first date,
a blowjob is so intimate.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.959
Intimacy isn't what's funny,

04:20.026 --> 04:21.995
it's that it's
the stranger request.

04:22.061 --> 04:23.763
Let's table this for now.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.231
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.667
I got that kindergarten
admissions interview.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.869
I can't believe you're going
from blowjobs to kindergarten.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.705
Oh, no, I'm not, I'm going
from handjobs to kindergarten.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.241
It's weird you're a mother.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.241
I know, right?

04:35.308 --> 04:37.210
Actually, she's very cute,
so I keep her.

04:37.276 --> 04:40.013
She was doing this pirate girl
thing the other day.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.981
You want to see pics?

04:40.079 --> 04:41.981
Sure, I love pirates.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.483
Okay, scroll through quickly.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.851
Oh, that's great!

04:44.917 --> 04:47.286
[chuckling]

04:44.917 --> 04:47.286
Right?

04:47.353 --> 04:50.923
Very good... amazing.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.526
[screams]

04:53.593 --> 04:54.594
God damn it!

04:54.661 --> 04:56.863
I can't believe
I fell for this again.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.298
It's my favorite bit.

04:59.365 --> 05:02.101
It's so crazy, it's like
she's biting down on, like,

05:02.168 --> 05:04.771
a fleshy animal's tail.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.906
But it's like she's getting
a real kick out of it.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.610
Her eyes say...
she's kind of delighted by it.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.478
What?
Have you looked at her eyes?

05:12.545 --> 05:15.481
Her eyes say, "I'm capable
of biting this dick off."

05:15.548 --> 05:18.084
All right, I gotta go.
I will email you the changes,

05:18.151 --> 05:19.686
obviously I'll change
that handjob.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.921
Blow... job.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.657
You know what, you're right,
it is weird that I'm going

05:24.724 --> 05:26.426
from blowjobs to a meeting
where I have to say,

05:26.492 --> 05:28.494
"I appreciate how
your school fosters..."

05:28.561 --> 05:30.630
...a sense of independence
and self-worth,

05:30.697 --> 05:35.301
which is what we want
her school to do.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.470
Good, well, we are very
proud of our program here

05:37.537 --> 05:38.538
and we really believe in it.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.273
You should.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.273
Thank you.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.208
So, tell me a little bit
about yourselves

05:42.275 --> 05:43.943
and what is it
that you two do?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.445
Well...

05:44.010 --> 05:45.445
I'm a lawyer,

05:45.511 --> 05:47.113
mostly entertainment law.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.082
And I am a writer.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.583
Really?

05:49.148 --> 05:50.583
Mm-hmm.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.085
What kind of stuff
do you write?

05:52.151 --> 05:57.924
Uh... it's a lot
of different... mediums,

05:57.990 --> 05:59.492
sort of that I could go...

05:59.559 --> 06:01.694
Such as?

05:59.559 --> 06:01.694
...slightly in the comedy space.

06:01.761 --> 06:05.998
There's some web, you know,
just different sort of like,

06:06.065 --> 06:07.400
podcast-y things.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.436
Oh, like NPR?

06:07.467 --> 06:10.436
Yeah, like NPR.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.940
The thing that I always
look back at is that

06:14.006 --> 06:15.708
it's the teachers that I had

06:15.775 --> 06:17.043
that instilled the confidence
in me in the first place

06:17.110 --> 06:18.411
to become a writer.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.379
I feel the same way about
my teachers, I mean,

06:20.446 --> 06:23.416
that's probably
how I ended up here.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.784
I think that went well.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.152
That went very well.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.920
I really liked old Joan Joan.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.089
Nice job dodging the
"what do you write?" question.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.959
Oh, my God, what if she
asks me for that podcast?

06:33.025 --> 06:34.894
She's going to be looking
for your podcast.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.830
Oh, "Joansies loves Chachies"
is not gonna like that podcast.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.633
Nope, you nailed that one.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.633
Thank you.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.635
But we're still not telling
her your last name, right?

06:42.702 --> 06:45.705
Oh, God, no, we can't have
Joansies Googling me.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.406
No, no good will come of that.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.406
No.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.642
Unless she thinks
I'm the other Andrea Warren

06:49.709 --> 06:52.512
whose that head nun at the
Stanbrook Abby in Devonshire,

06:52.578 --> 06:55.915
England, because she does
very, very important things.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.917
But we're still not telling
her your last name, right?

06:57.984 --> 07:00.119
Oh, right, just be
lucky you're not married

07:00.186 --> 07:02.421
to the other Andrea Warren
who burned her house down

07:02.488 --> 07:04.924
with her entire family inside.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.924
She sounds nice.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.459
Okay.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.459
All right.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.161
I gotta go pick up Amelia,
I'll see you later.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.329
Wait.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.664
You think this is
one of those moments

07:11.731 --> 07:13.332
where we're supposed to
make out?

07:13.399 --> 07:14.534
Make out?

07:13.399 --> 07:14.534
Yeah.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.935
Why would we make out now?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.403
I don't know, bro!

07:17.470 --> 07:19.172
I'm just trying to be
open to new things.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.640
Uh-huh, this is
what you're open to?

07:20.706 --> 07:22.408
Making out in the potential
school parking lot.

07:22.475 --> 07:26.445
Listen, we're just all spinning
on the same big, blue marble.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.981
Cool, bro.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.981
So, bye, bro.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.516
Get on the marble.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.190
Aww, but then Max,
you're going to miss him

07:37.256 --> 07:38.891
when he doesn't
want to do that anymore.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.294
Okay, I have a question for your
guys-- it's not about pooping.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.762
Sorry, Brian.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.664
All right, I know we don't
know each other that well,

07:44.730 --> 07:46.532
but I need a group of married
people for this poll.

07:46.599 --> 07:51.037
Do you guys ever just,
like, make out?

07:51.103 --> 07:52.772
Like with my husband?

07:51.103 --> 07:52.772
Yeah.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.473
Mike and I were out the other
night, we saw this, like,

07:54.540 --> 07:57.210
longtime couple just going
at it, and I was like,

07:57.276 --> 08:00.479
is everyone else just
going around, making out?

08:00.546 --> 08:02.849
Making out is what you do
when you can't have sex.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.517
Right?

08:02.915 --> 08:04.517
Right, yeah.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.920
Well, I feel like Brendon
and I something just make out.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.488
Really?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.488
I mean, not out in public.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.457
Sometimes it's nice
to have a session

08:11.524 --> 08:13.292
that doesn't
have to end in sex.

08:13.359 --> 08:15.194
You know what, that's
actually a good way to put it.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.563
I agree with that,
and I feel like Mike and I do,

08:17.630 --> 08:18.764
but I don't know.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.834
Laura, Affection may be
your Love Language.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.904
What are the words coming
out of your mouth right now?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.138
Your Love Language--
oh, see,

08:26.205 --> 08:27.406
Gail and I have been
reading this book...

08:27.473 --> 08:28.841
Really?

08:28.908 --> 08:30.710
...called "The Five Love
Languages," and it's all about

08:30.776 --> 08:34.814
how people bring in
different expressions of love

08:34.881 --> 08:36.215
in very different ways.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.683
Do you have to do
this with it?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.886
It makes you want to do this
if you read that book.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.420
It does, yeah,
my husband and I read it.

08:41.487 --> 08:42.521
It just kind of
tweaks the way

08:42.588 --> 08:44.023
you think about
your relationship.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.558
Can I borrow your copy?

08:45.625 --> 08:46.926
No, no.

08:46.993 --> 08:50.129
What do you mean, "No, no"?
Why can't I borrow your copy?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.297
Just download it.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.832
No, I'm not
going to download it!

08:52.899 --> 08:55.534
I like a book in my hand,
I'm not a monster, Brian.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.371
If anyone knows monsters,
it's this monster.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.873
How dare you.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.873
Oh, he likes you, he is a flirt.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.775
Oh, he is going to be
such a heartbreaker,

09:02.842 --> 09:04.076
you better watch out.

09:04.143 --> 09:06.112
Oh, what about this
smiling little girl?

09:06.178 --> 09:08.547
She's going to be
a little cock tease.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.917
You watch out.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.785
Wow.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.087
Oh... no, I'm not...

09:15.154 --> 09:20.393
obviously calling her an actual
blank-tease, I would...

09:20.459 --> 09:23.029
You said he was a flirt,
he's a baby.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.531
I was doing the same thing.

09:25.598 --> 09:29.502
I-- I was just flipping it
for the girls' side, you know.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.472
By the way, it's kind of
a poignant joke,

09:33.539 --> 09:35.141
if you think about it,
talking about that

09:35.207 --> 09:37.109
the way we talk
about different genders--

09:37.176 --> 09:40.279
oh, my God,
here are the kids! Yay!

09:42.615 --> 09:45.251
It just seems like everyone
at school is, you know,

09:45.318 --> 09:47.520
joking around,
they're seemingly very cool,

09:47.586 --> 09:48.888
and then suddenly
I say something

09:48.955 --> 09:50.623
that clearly crosses a line.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.792
I forget that other people
have a much closer line

09:52.858 --> 09:54.927
than the hilarious,
disgusting, broken people

09:54.994 --> 09:57.496
that I consider to be some of
my closest friends.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.699
Yeah, as a lawyer I got to
go to work and be serious

09:59.765 --> 10:01.968
in front of my clients,
but then I get to come home

10:02.034 --> 10:04.370
and relax and be funny.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.206
You are the worst.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.075
The point is, everyone
has to wear a few hats.

10:09.141 --> 10:12.378
I know, but for me, it's like
two very different hats.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.514
Like, one is a hat
and one is a blouse.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.750
Well, you gotta make a blouse
look good on top of your head.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.752
Done.
You're going to have to
pull back a little at school

10:19.819 --> 10:21.687
unless you want "cock tease"
to define your daughter.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.056
Mike, that baby
was the cock tease.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.358
Amelia is more a prude.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.993
Feel free to pull back
at home too.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.395
Obviously I don't want to
negatively affect her life,

10:29.462 --> 10:32.298
and these people are her world,
farts, farts, farts.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.899
I guess this is
one of those shitty times

10:33.966 --> 10:36.535
where I have to suck it up
and pretend to be grown up.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.271
I've kind of been
waiting for this moment.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.639
Oh, fuck you face, Mike.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.576
Really?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.544
Yeah.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.179
I don't think that's the one.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.181
I think they recommended
"The Four Agreements"

10:49.248 --> 10:50.483
and "Way of
the Peaceful Warrior".

10:50.549 --> 10:52.585
I already read
"Peaceful Warrior".

10:52.651 --> 10:54.086
Oh, what about
"The Power of Now"?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.855
If you guys are looking for
"The Four Ingredients"--

10:55.921 --> 10:57.590
sorry, didn't mean
to eavesdrop, but...

10:57.656 --> 10:58.891
No.

10:57.656 --> 10:58.891
...I think that's your guy.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.226
Thank you.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.495
You guys really are working
through this section.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.063
I'm impressed.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.598
I'm just going through
some stuff.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.600
He's working on himself.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.600
I like your honesty.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.503
Is that like a pre-requisite
to even step into this area?

11:10.569 --> 11:12.204
How about you?
Why are you in this section?

11:12.271 --> 11:13.773
I guess we are being honest.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.374
Nothing, really, I'm just
picking up this book,

11:15.441 --> 11:16.509
a friend of mine
recommended it.

11:16.575 --> 11:17.576
I read that book.

11:16.575 --> 11:17.576
Really?

11:17.643 --> 11:18.878
Gary Chapman is the shit.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.913
I feel like that
should be on the cover.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.582
Acts of Service.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.582
I don't know what that means.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.785
That's a Love Language,
how to accept love.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.054
Okay, okay, is that
a little about, okay.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.689
Dude, remember we thought yours
was "Word of Affirmation"?

11:30.756 --> 11:34.727
Oh, yeah, "Acts of Service"
is my main, because of my mom,

11:34.794 --> 11:36.028
she was never really
super huggy-kissy.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.329
Mine, the same thing.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.831
My mom is not like an,
"I love you" person.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.766
But mine, she was always there,
helping me out.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.601
I'm like the same thing,
Acts of Service,

11:42.668 --> 11:44.703
that's what she was for me.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.205
I'm very excited
to read this now.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.574
Thank you guys for the rec.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.376
Physical touch is
my love language.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.078
Oh, okay, cool, cool.

11:54.513 --> 11:55.681
I'm sorry.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.483
Are you waiting for me
to touch you?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.218
Whatever you want.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.387
Okay, sure.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.825
There you go,
how did that feel?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.560
Thanks, man.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.361
Nope, I don't think
I'm Physical Touch.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.564
I'm going with vest,
Acts of Service.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.566
All day, every day.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.769
[phone ringing]

12:16.836 --> 12:18.571
Hey, Dad.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.571
Hi, Grampy!

12:18.637 --> 12:20.072
<i>Hey, sunshine!</i>

12:20.139 --> 12:21.907
<i>I'm sending you kisses...</i>
<i>[kissing]</i>

12:21.974 --> 12:24.510
Okay, it's just me now.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.510
Oh, okay.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.179
So you know how
I'm dating my allergist?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.081
No, I didn't even know
you had allergies.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.883
Yeah, she's that good.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.551
<i>Yeah, Bonnie's wonderful,</i>
<i>I've never been so happy.</i>

12:32.618 --> 12:33.919
Oh, that's fabulous.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.955
How long have you been
seeing this Bon-bon?

12:36.021 --> 12:38.791
About a month now,
and I'm excited about it.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.960
In fact, she's here now.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.960
<i>Oh, good, good, good.</i>

12:41.026 --> 12:43.362
<i>Honey, could I get</i>
<i>another Merlot?</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.498
Merlot?
Dad, it's nine a.m.

12:45.564 --> 12:46.932
Where do we have to be,
sweetheart?

12:46.999 --> 12:48.968
Apparently nowhere sober.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.968
<i>So listen,</i>

12:49.034 --> 12:51.103
we spend a lot of time
with her kids.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.906
You do?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.906
<i>Yeah, and I was thinking that</i>

12:53.973 --> 12:55.474
I would like her
to get to meet you guys.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.109
I would love to meet Bonnie.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.546
How about you come over
for drinks next Saturday?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.914
Okay, so like at nine a.m.?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.749
Whenever you want to start.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.118
All right, let me talk to Mike,
and we'll figure out

13:06.185 --> 13:07.920
when a good time is
for us to come.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.922
Enjoy your morning
Merlot, dad.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.857
And it's casual,
wear anything you want.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.493
<i>I wasn't going to dress up.</i>

13:11.924 --> 13:14.493
Okay.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.828
Bye.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.828
<i>Bye.</i>

13:15.895 --> 13:17.396
[phone beeps]

13:15.895 --> 13:17.396
Big news--

13:17.463 --> 13:18.898
thank you, by the way--

13:18.964 --> 13:22.701
my dad has allergies,
and also a new girlfriend.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.270
Well, at least he
moved off your mom.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.939
Please, he's biding his time
until Leon dies.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.474
But we're going
to head over to my dad's

13:28.541 --> 13:31.076
and meet Bonnie next
weekend for a drink.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.411
Very cool.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.646
Oh, what's happening?

13:33.712 --> 13:34.747
You like that?

13:34.813 --> 13:37.249
I'm not sure, I think.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.884
Okay... wow.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.319
According to this book
that I've been reading,

13:40.386 --> 13:42.655
everybody takes in love in,
like, a different way,

13:42.721 --> 13:45.991
and those are called their Love
Languages, and I think for you,

13:46.058 --> 13:48.994
your Love Language
is Physical Touch.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.429
Okay.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.429
With a little bit of

13:50.496 --> 13:52.298
Words of Affirmation.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.501
You are great.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.936
That probably should
creep me out,

13:57.002 --> 13:58.204
but that was
actually very nice.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.538
Right?

13:58.270 --> 13:59.538
Thank you.

13:59.605 --> 14:00.806
And it actually
makes a lot of sense.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.508
What other languages are there?

14:02.575 --> 14:04.810
Well, we got your Physical
Touch, Words of Affirmation,

14:04.877 --> 14:07.413
you got Gift Giving, Acts of
Service, and Quality Time.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.215
Doesn't everyone love
all those things, or...?

14:09.281 --> 14:10.282
If you think about it,

14:10.349 --> 14:12.818
one of them will
particularly speak to you.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.553
Like in my case,
it's all Acts of Service.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.323
You could say nice things to me
all day, it wouldn't mean shit.

14:17.389 --> 14:18.524
Oh.

14:17.389 --> 14:18.524
But if you, like,

14:18.591 --> 14:20.125
make a dinner reservation,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.761
then I get a giant
lady boner, bing.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.430
Is it hard to make
a dinner reservation?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.198
No, but that's not the point.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.001
It's like you did something for
me and so then I don't have to.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.570
I think it's sweet that you're
thinking about our relationship.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.172
I always think about
our relationship.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.907
I know you do,
but I know that this is...

14:34.974 --> 14:36.108
I don't always think about
our relationship.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.810
...I appreciate never, and...

14:37.876 --> 14:40.045
Just to be clear, but I am
thinking about it now.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.847
Would you like me
to read the book?

14:40.112 --> 14:41.847
Go for it.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.015
Nice.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.015
Yeah.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.516
How about I make
dinner tonight?

14:44.583 --> 14:47.186
Mmm... bing.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.922
You got that was
my clitoris, right?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.922
Yep, it read.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.694
Oh, yeah, it's the worst.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.463
By the end, Jeff is on top,
I'm on the bottom,

14:57.529 --> 15:00.466
and we still can't
shove the thing in the hole.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.001
That's what she said.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.902
Okay, I wasn't going
to say it, for the record.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.905
By the way, Acts of Service with
a little touch of Gift Giving.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.407
I read the book.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.876
Oh, same but different--
a little touch of Gift Giving,

15:10.943 --> 15:12.778
with a<i> scootch</i> of
Acts of Service.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.213
Oh, I see you.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.814
Yeah, I'm looking
at you as well.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.517
Acts of Service, that was
my nickname in college.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.753
Oh, no, that's what
we call you now.

15:20.819 --> 15:25.291
Oh, coming in strong!
I like it!

15:25.357 --> 15:27.493
Hey, what do you have in there?
It looks really heavy.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.496
Oh, that's just heroin,
I sell it to the kids.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.031
It's important to get
them hooked young.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.099
I mean, the good news is
their skin comes back so fast

15:34.166 --> 15:36.769
you never see track marks.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.537
Oh, come on!

15:38.604 --> 15:40.439
Everyone's on board
for the slutty nickname

15:40.506 --> 15:42.007
and jamming things
in Callie's hole?

15:42.074 --> 15:45.044
This, this is the thing
that crosses the line?

15:45.110 --> 15:49.415
I think you-- I'm not
carrying heroin in my bag!

15:49.481 --> 15:50.783
I got books in here,

15:50.849 --> 15:52.951
used books that I am
donating to the school.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.387
Okay, I get it,
it was a funny joke.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.256
Okay, thank you.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.925
Plus, I mean, guys, this is
a pretty nice bag.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.494
I'm not going to put
heroin in here.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.831
It's obviously
made more for cocaine.

16:05.898 --> 16:06.632
Oh, my God.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.134
Okay, you know what?

16:09.201 --> 16:11.904
Let's talk about carpool.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.706
I was actually married
to Martin's lawyer.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.675
Oh, well, well.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.675
And we were all friends,

16:16.742 --> 16:18.944
but then I realized
he wasn't the one for me,

16:19.011 --> 16:20.579
and I turned around
and there was Martin.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.980
Oh, my God, Bonnie,
I'm sorry,

16:22.047 --> 16:23.449
that must have been
very startling.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.250
Well...

16:23.515 --> 16:25.250
Picture window,

16:25.317 --> 16:26.552
plastered up against it.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.220
When I'm with him,

16:28.287 --> 16:30.589
I still can't shake him,
that's what's startling.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.424
Should we be alarmed, Bonnie?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.426
Maybe we should establish
a safe word.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.697
I have met my match.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.532
I'm going to get
another drink-- anybody else?

16:40.599 --> 16:42.134
I'm good-- I'll help you
get more chips, though.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.168
I'll have another Rose.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.204
Honey, you want me
to get you anything?

16:45.270 --> 16:46.672
Yeah, yeah, I'll have another
glass of wine, that'll be great.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.707
Okay, great.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.707
But I'll... I'll get it.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.843
No, I got it.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.843
No, uh, seriously.

16:50.909 --> 16:52.678
I will get it.

16:50.909 --> 16:52.678
I don't want you to do it,

16:52.745 --> 16:54.580
I want to get it.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.647
No.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.647
All right.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.083
This guy.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.418
[clears throat]

16:59.485 --> 17:00.953
It looks to me like
she's gonna get it.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.654
She's gettin' it.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.654
Mm-hmm.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.726
Dad, I love Bonnie,
she is awesome.

17:07.793 --> 17:09.395
Yep, she's a keeper, huh?

17:09.461 --> 17:12.064
I have to say, it's refreshing
to be around new love.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.732
What, are you and Mike
having problems?

17:13.799 --> 17:14.967
Dad, it's an expression.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.301
Because I know
how hard it is

17:16.368 --> 17:19.071
to keep a lasting
relationship alive.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.106
Trust me, I've been
through two of them.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.509
You've been through
more than that, I think.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.545
Actually, Mike and I are kind
of<i> zhuzhing</i> our relationship

17:26.612 --> 17:28.914
a little bit these days,
keeping it fresh.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.016
I think there are really
two fundamental truths

17:31.083 --> 17:33.485
you have to keep in mind
for a happy relationship.

17:33.552 --> 17:37.656
Number one, above all, it's
about honesty and communication.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.292
And number two,
I don't think one person

17:40.359 --> 17:43.095
is ever going to fulfill
everything you need,

17:43.162 --> 17:45.697
and I think it's wrong
to expect that of someone.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.367
That's actually very smart,
that makes sense.

17:48.434 --> 17:52.371
That's why you need
to have an open relationship.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.539
What?

17:53.605 --> 17:55.974
It's what Bonnie and I have.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.444
Wow!

17:58.510 --> 17:59.845
Really?

17:58.510 --> 17:59.845
Yeah.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.280
Cool, cool, cool.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.949
I'm going to head outside
with all this stuff,

18:04.016 --> 18:07.753
but thank you
for all that advice, cool.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.154
Again, cool, cool, cool.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.823
Speaking of which,
how's your mother?

18:10.889 --> 18:11.957
Still with Leon.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.159
And he is...?

18:12.024 --> 18:14.159
Very healthy.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.594
Wait, wait, wait,
an open relationship?

18:15.661 --> 18:17.196
Yeah, yeah.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.231
It was crazy, okay, he was
acting like he was making

18:19.298 --> 18:22.000
complete sense and he understood
how hard a relationship

18:22.067 --> 18:24.803
was to maintain, and then
suddenly I'm picturing my dad

18:24.870 --> 18:26.305
in an "Eyes Wide Shut"
situation.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.639
Oh, I don't want
to picture any of that.

18:27.706 --> 18:28.974
Yeah, you know what I know?

18:29.041 --> 18:30.642
We need to keep
this marriage amazing,

18:30.709 --> 18:32.578
because otherwise it's just
morning Merlot and orgies

18:32.644 --> 18:34.279
in my future, okay?

18:34.346 --> 18:36.315
Which is normally something
I would pretend sounds amazing

18:36.381 --> 18:38.217
just to bother you, but I can't
even joke right now.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.551
I understand.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.086
I don't want to be
those people that are like,

18:41.153 --> 18:43.088
"Oh, we've been together
for so long,

18:43.155 --> 18:44.256
we need to spice things up."

18:44.323 --> 18:45.858
Are we?
Are we those people?

18:45.924 --> 18:47.459
Maybe?

18:45.924 --> 18:47.459
Because I don't think a little

18:47.526 --> 18:50.929
nice gesture and fickle touch
is gonna cut it, my friend.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.065
I knew that that shoulder rub
wasn't random.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.566
Were you really
jumping out of your seat

18:54.633 --> 18:55.901
to get that glass of wine?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.503
No, see, everything I do
feels calculated.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.104
That book got in my head.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.873
Yeah, well, this is why
we don't rely on ourselves

19:00.939 --> 19:02.908
to work on ourselves,
okay, number one.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.409
You know who I blame?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.112
Fucking Brian,
and fucking Gail.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.348
Who's Gail?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.348
Brian's wife, Gail.

19:09.414 --> 19:10.849
Oh, right.

19:09.414 --> 19:10.849
We've gone to dinner with them.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.351
Yeah, fuck.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.286
You know what? This should
be our Love Language,

19:14.353 --> 19:15.988
telling people to go
fuck themselves.

19:16.054 --> 19:17.456
Uh-huh.

19:16.054 --> 19:17.456
Oh, my God!

19:17.523 --> 19:19.291
He's just, like,
so casual about it.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.059
Maybe we should go
talk to Jim?

19:21.126 --> 19:22.961
Yeah, a therapy session
probably wouldn't hurt.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.796
You want me to make
the appointment?

19:24.863 --> 19:26.765
Fuck you and your
nice gesture,

19:26.832 --> 19:28.467
I will make the appointment.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.305
So, I mean, it's just
everything's starting to feel

19:33.372 --> 19:36.041
really contrived with the
Love Languages and then my dad

19:36.108 --> 19:37.709
is saying we should start
seeing other people.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.545
There's a lot of...

19:39.611 --> 19:41.446
a lot of stuff being
thrown at us at once.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.316
We are very confused.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.316
Yes, very confused.

19:44.383 --> 19:49.154
Andrea, your dad is a whole
separate therapy session.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.089
We should start saving up
for that.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.089
Yeah.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.724
Guys, you are not
falling apart, okay?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.427
You've been together for
ten years and you're in a rut.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.797
This is what's amusing is I feel
like we are genuinely happy.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.332
Yeah.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.332
And then suddenly,

20:00.399 --> 20:03.402
all of a sudden,
stuff was feeling weird.

20:00.399 --> 20:03.402
Right.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.804
You can be happy
and still need to work

20:05.871 --> 20:07.773
on your romantic relationship.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.008
But we have sex twice a week.

20:10.075 --> 20:13.011
Some of us have it
three times a week.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.613
Listen, it's not
about quantity,

20:14.680 --> 20:16.748
it's about quality.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.851
Do you feel like you
still try new things

20:19.918 --> 20:21.920
and still surprise
each other?

20:21.987 --> 20:24.122
Yeah, I don't know.

20:21.987 --> 20:24.122
Maybe.

20:24.189 --> 20:26.291
There might be room
for improvement.

20:26.358 --> 20:27.893
Yeah, I guess so.

20:26.358 --> 20:27.893
Yeah.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.561
What you're going through
is totally normal.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.196
That makes me feel better.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.196
Yeah.
[phone vibrating]

20:31.263 --> 20:32.864
You guys are great
together, right?

20:32.931 --> 20:34.800
It's been some years.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.800
[phone vibrating]

20:34.866 --> 20:37.469
And so you might
need to make

20:37.536 --> 20:39.471
a little bit more
of a conscious effort.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.807
Why don't we talk
about some tools?

20:41.873 --> 20:44.276
I'm so sorry, I just
keep getting texted.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.145
Someone's saying
it's urgent, I'm sorry,

20:47.212 --> 20:48.447
honey, I'll be right back.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.948
No problem.

20:51.249 --> 20:52.818
Hi, is everything all right?

20:52.884 --> 20:54.753
What's happening? Are you okay?
What's going on?

20:54.820 --> 20:57.322
You were right.
Handjob's funnier.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.091
That's why you were
calling me?

20:59.157 --> 21:00.592
<i>Suck my dick, Kyle!</i>

21:00.659 --> 21:02.260
That is funnier,
actually, though.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.663
I have to go, bye.
[phone beeps]

21:04.730 --> 21:06.231
Sorry, sorry.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.101
My friend Kyle was
in a small car accident.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.304
He's shaken,
but totally fine.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.539
Okay, so where are we?

21:14.606 --> 21:19.411
We're going to get some
tools to spicy our life up?

21:19.478 --> 21:20.746
I think we start
with this, right?

21:20.812 --> 21:22.214
Too much shoulders, right?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.218
We're actually almost
done with the outline.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.020
I think we're going to be
ready to pitch next week.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.521
Okay, good.

21:29.588 --> 21:30.789
I'm very happy with
how it's coming out.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.225
It's really like--

21:33.291 --> 21:34.693
Oh, my God.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.828
What is happening?
What?

21:36.895 --> 21:39.264
Mike, that doesn't go
like that!

21:39.331 --> 21:41.867
Stop, I have lotion on!

21:41.933 --> 21:44.636
Stop, stop, stop!

21:44.703 --> 21:47.305
Sorry... sorry.

21:49.641 --> 21:53.745
I'm going to need you
to explain

21:53.812 --> 21:56.648
what just happened here.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.684
Well...

21:58.750 --> 22:01.987
Jim, our therapist...

21:58.750 --> 22:01.987
Uh-huh.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.822
He said that maybe because
you're an alpha woman,

22:03.889 --> 22:07.993
maybe you would
enjoy being dominated.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.594
What?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.264
He said a lot of women
have rape fantasies.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.700
Our therapist told you
to rape me?

22:14.766 --> 22:17.235
Yes, that's exactly
the word he used, yeah.

22:17.302 --> 22:20.072
I stepped out of the room
for two seconds and he was like,

22:20.138 --> 22:22.674
"Hey, Mike,
rape Andrea later?"

22:22.741 --> 22:24.242
I wanted to run it by you,

22:24.309 --> 22:28.780
but apparently the element of
surprise is a crucial element.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.082
I don't think you
could have rape

22:30.148 --> 22:32.451
without the element
of surprise,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.152
I guess.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.152
Listen...

22:34.219 --> 22:35.721
I know you think this is funny.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.721
I...

22:35.787 --> 22:37.289
Just give me a second,
please.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.691
We talked about spicing up
things and whatever.

22:39.758 --> 22:43.528
You said, "Hey, what can we do?"

22:39.758 --> 22:43.528
I did.

22:43.595 --> 22:47.632
And you did the shimmy thing,
so...

22:47.699 --> 22:50.235
Are you saying
that I asked for it?

22:50.302 --> 22:53.238
No-- no, no, no, no,
I would never say that.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.473
I'm kidding.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.909
I honestly-- and this is
something that unfortunately

22:57.976 --> 23:00.078
I feel like people don't
get to say very often--

23:00.145 --> 23:03.415
I think it's very sweet
that you tried to rape me.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.183
Wow, that sounds horrible.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.518
No, I'm serious.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.420
You, you put yourself out
there and did something

23:08.487 --> 23:10.922
that's very contrary to
your nature just because

23:10.989 --> 23:12.257
you thought I would like it,

23:12.324 --> 23:15.060
and that's actually
very touching.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.296
Thank you for trying
to rape me.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.664
What?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.533
Stop saying that word.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.533
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.568
Thank you for trying to...

23:23.635 --> 23:27.339
violate me... violently?

23:27.405 --> 23:30.008
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you need me to hold you?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.410
Come here.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.410
Please, please.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.881
I mean, you came in hot.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.849
I don't think I'm ready
to talk about this yet.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.352
That's fair, I get that.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.154
But remember when you
came in from the bathroom

23:42.220 --> 23:44.089
and threw me on the bed
and then tried to rape me?

23:44.156 --> 23:46.758
I was like,
"What's happening?"

23:46.825 --> 23:47.859
I'm going to take a shower.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.761
Ooh, like a "Silkwood" shower?

23:49.828 --> 23:51.096
Oh, my God.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.230
You know what,
don't worry about it.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.732
I'll get in there with you.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.233
Really?

23:53.799 --> 23:55.233
Yeah.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.669
Oh, maybe this
worked out after all.

23:57.736 --> 24:01.239
Well, you haven't seen the way
I'm going to give you a shower.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.108
"We ask that all parents
please abstain from using

24:03.175 --> 24:05.811
"any objectionable language
while on school premises

24:05.877 --> 24:08.313
just in case little
ears are listening."

24:08.380 --> 24:10.682
Do you think someone
complained about my jokes?

24:10.749 --> 24:11.950
No, but the timing
s conspicuous.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.685
Okay, you know what,
this is so stupid.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.855
I'm not hiding, okay, I'm a mom
and I do comedy, okay.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.990
Nothing I do is
hurting Amelia.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.893
Mommy, I just saw
the funniest picture.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.461
What was it, Bugs?

24:23.528 --> 24:26.565
It was a weird lady
biting the tail of some animal.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.834
Oh, my God, um...

24:28.900 --> 24:32.337
That was a weird lady.

24:32.404 --> 24:36.174
Okay, maybe I'll pull back
a little.

24:36.241 --> 24:36.875
[whispering]
I'm sorry.
