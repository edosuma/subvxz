'Live from ABC,
this is Eyewitness News at Six.

01:37.979 --> 01:40.058
'The murder case against
Michael Peterson

01:40.059 --> 01:42.577
'doesn't just involve
his wife any more,

01:42.578 --> 01:45.857
'it involves
a friend who died 18 years ago.

01:45.858 --> 01:48.936
'Just like Kathleen Peterson,
Ratliff was found dead

'Eyewitness News reporter
Anthony Wilson has more

01:53.217 --> 01:55.535
'on the potentially explosive

01:55.536 --> 01:58.295
'Elizabeth Ratliff was
a friend of Michael Peterson.

01:58.296 --> 02:00.175
'In fact, Peterson was with Ratliff

02:00.176 --> 02:02.614
'the night before she was
found dead in Germany.

02:02.615 --> 02:06.094
'Ratliff's body was discovered
at the bottom of a staircase in 1985

02:06.095 --> 02:09.453
'and prosecutors have implied
the circumstances of her death

02:09.454 --> 02:12.373
'mirror those of Michael Peterson's
wife Kathleen.

02:12.374 --> 02:16.652
'She was found dead in the Peterson
home back in January 2001.'

02:16.653 --> 02:19.573
Anything for me? No.

02:21.252 --> 02:24.092
OK, you guys have got
a much better film now.

02:34.610 --> 02:39.369
What did Margaret Ratliff tell you
about what happened to her mother?

02:39.370 --> 02:42.408
Does she know any of the details?
No, she doesn't.

02:42.409 --> 02:44.528
With the exception that her mother

02:44.529 --> 02:46.127
died of a natural cause.

02:46.128 --> 02:51.047
Didn't we look at this
a few months ago

02:51.048 --> 02:54.526
and didn't Mike give us
an autopsy or something

02:54.527 --> 02:58.966
that said cause of death, a stroke
or cerebrovascular haemorrhage,

02:58.967 --> 03:01.125
or something like that? Right.

03:01.126 --> 03:05.245
He told us that
he had been with her the day before,

03:05.246 --> 03:08.724
I think, with Patty,
they had dinner or something.

03:08.725 --> 03:10.564
But you know what the authorities
will do.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.923
The police are going to assume
that because she was found

03:12.924 --> 03:14.123
at the bottom of the stairs,

03:14.124 --> 03:16.163
they're going to try
to link them together.

03:16.164 --> 03:17.683
Whether or not they're successful...

03:17.684 --> 03:20.562
Like the stairway killer,
is that the idea?

03:20.563 --> 03:22.402
Apparently that's what
they're going to...

03:22.403 --> 03:26.281
He's found a way to kill women
17 years apart...

03:26.282 --> 03:28.001
This is, like, in the mid-'80s?

03:28.002 --> 03:30.761
Yeah, this is 1985, I believe.

03:30.762 --> 03:34.000
So he strikes, like, every 17 years

03:34.001 --> 03:38.759
by finding some way to kill women
on a stairway, is that the...?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.199
Right. Of course, it helps the case.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.359
You know, if you have two people
found at the bottom of the stairs,

03:44.360 --> 03:47.198
they're going to try to bring
that in, one way or the other.

03:47.199 --> 03:51.197
I mean, I don't know what's there,
and it may be nothing,

03:51.198 --> 03:54.717
but if it is nothing,
we need to find out it's nothing.

03:54.718 --> 03:58.836
Because I'm not going to be
very... comfortable,

03:58.837 --> 04:01.316
being surprised by something
that happened in Germany.

04:01.317 --> 04:02.677
Oh, I know.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.154
I know you don't know much
about the case,

04:14.155 --> 04:17.433
but we all form impressions
from whatever we've heard.

04:17.434 --> 04:20.753
Howard,
what's your gut-level reaction?

04:20.754 --> 04:23.393
Can I ask one question before?
Sure.

04:23.394 --> 04:27.072
OK. Someone said that
it was another wife

04:27.073 --> 04:30.032
that died in similar circumstances.

04:30.033 --> 04:33.271
I think... I don't know
whether she was a wife

04:33.272 --> 04:36.191
or whether there was another woman,
that it came up

04:36.192 --> 04:39.350
that she may have fallen
in similar circumstances.

04:39.351 --> 04:42.630
And someone had said
they need to check that out.

04:42.631 --> 04:47.270
This second incident in Europe casts
a long shadow on Michael Peterson.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.869
It really does create
a lot of doubt. OK.

04:53.229 --> 04:58.907
And so I think that people are going
to really question his innocence

04:58.908 --> 05:00.507
because of this.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.067
Because the two instances,

05:02.068 --> 05:05.267
as I remember reading,
were so very similar.

05:06.507 --> 05:10.865
Can you be back here
in 40, 35 minutes?

05:10.866 --> 05:13.746
Is that enough time?
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.984
The Germany thing
is out there already.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.704
We're not going to get rid of that,
it's there, you know,

05:20.705 --> 05:22.583
there is no getting rid of it.

05:22.584 --> 05:25.583
All we can do right now is...
I agree with David.

05:25.584 --> 05:26.943
Can I make a suggestion?

05:26.944 --> 05:29.302
I'd like to know, if you were
to ask him one more time,

05:29.303 --> 05:31.462
what would you want to know
about the Germany thing?

05:31.463 --> 05:32.942
What would you want
to know about it?

05:32.943 --> 05:34.302
And then answer the questions.

05:34.303 --> 05:39.101
OK. Do you want me to start
by clarifying the Germany thing?

05:39.102 --> 05:41.900
Yes, I think now
that it's on the table,

05:41.901 --> 05:43.780
I think what we have to do,

05:43.781 --> 05:48.419
here are the facts that are known
right now about Germany.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.579
We know what we're going
to be able to show.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.659
There was no financial benefit
from it.

05:52.660 --> 05:56.979
He did take, you know, he took care
of the kids for the next 16 years.

05:58.219 --> 06:00.138
There was no evidence of any affair.

06:00.139 --> 06:02.617
D'you want to mention
the 70,000 or not?

06:02.618 --> 06:06.497
Yeah, you can say that there was
a 70,000 life... insurance policy,

06:06.498 --> 06:09.096
and that's all the money that...
And it was left to the girls.

06:09.097 --> 06:12.977
Right. Which he spent on the girls.
Right. Which was spent on the girls.

06:14.416 --> 06:19.135
What happened is that during
the night or the few days following

06:19.136 --> 06:23.334
the death of Mrs Peterson,
the police overheard some people

06:23.335 --> 06:26.894
talking about, well,
this is really a double tragedy

06:26.895 --> 06:31.853
because Margaret and Martha's mother
died in the same way.

06:31.854 --> 06:37.812
And that is why the police
decided to check into it

06:37.813 --> 06:40.851
and go to Germany and find out
what the circumstances were.

06:40.852 --> 06:42.331
It wasn't the same window.

06:42.332 --> 06:45.931
I would think the defence would
benefit from this story

06:45.932 --> 06:49.370
being brought up in the case
because my opinion has gone,

06:49.371 --> 06:55.849
like you say, the higher respect,
moral character towards Peterson

06:55.850 --> 06:59.569
by the man who would do that,
take on the children, etc.

06:59.570 --> 07:02.208
I have to say, I have a totally
new respect for the man.

07:02.209 --> 07:04.968
Anybody who'd take on someone else's
children and raise them

07:04.969 --> 07:07.927
and they are not blood children,
because when they got divorced,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.287
he could easily have said,

07:09.288 --> 07:11.607
"Go with Patty, or go to the state",
or whatever.

07:11.608 --> 07:16.526
I'm just thinking that the group
in general jumped to a conclusion

07:16.527 --> 07:20.765
of innocence because he adopted
these... her two children,

07:20.766 --> 07:23.365
the woman who died.
No, that's not what happened.

07:23.366 --> 07:25.205
I don't think you can do that.

07:25.206 --> 07:29.724
Let's assume, for instance, that he
had an affair with this woman, OK?

07:29.725 --> 07:34.484
And he was discovered, OK? I'm going
to write one of his books now.

07:35.844 --> 07:39.082
Suppose he has to get rid of her,

07:39.083 --> 07:42.562
and does,
then adopting the children

07:42.563 --> 07:46.042
would make him look innocent,
wouldn't it?

07:53.281 --> 07:56.720
Here's a picture of Axel here. OK.
When we get in the airport...

07:56.721 --> 07:58.479
So he's going to meet us
at the airport?

07:58.480 --> 08:00.879
Axel's going to meet us
at the airport.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.398
Grafenhausen is where Elizabeth
was living at the time of her death.

08:05.399 --> 08:08.238
That's also where
Mike and Patty were living.

08:08.239 --> 08:12.557
And one of the first people
we're going to see is Patty herself.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.997
Where's Patty living now?
Grafenhausen.

08:14.998 --> 08:16.877
Oh, she's still living there?
Yeah.

08:16.878 --> 08:20.036
But a different house?
Different house, not far,

08:20.037 --> 08:21.877
it's just a little village.

08:23.037 --> 08:25.355
And Patty is taking us over
to the apartment.

08:25.356 --> 08:27.835
She says a woman lives there,
but doesn't know her,

08:27.836 --> 08:29.955
so we're just going to go
and knock on her door.

08:29.956 --> 08:31.234
Hopefully she'll let us in.

08:31.235 --> 08:33.354
You're talking about
Elizabeth's apartment?

08:33.355 --> 08:34.994
Elizabeth's old apartment, yeah.

08:34.995 --> 08:37.313
In my mind,
there are two main things

08:37.315 --> 08:41.274
that I think we should be
focusing on when we go over there.

08:43.193 --> 08:44.712
First of all...

08:44.713 --> 08:49.472
I think we need to understand
what the relationship was

08:49.473 --> 08:52.111
between Mike and Patty
on the one hand

08:52.112 --> 08:54.391
and Elizabeth Ratliff on the other.

08:54.392 --> 08:57.270
And the second thing I think
we really need to focus on is

08:57.271 --> 09:00.670
what happened on the morning
that Elizabeth Ratliff died.

09:00.671 --> 09:03.509
What time did Barbara find her?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.789
What were the conditions like,
you know,

09:05.790 --> 09:08.709
what happened after
Barbara found her?

09:08.710 --> 09:12.429
What were Mike and Patty doing?
All that sort of stuff.

09:49.223 --> 09:52.582
I hear Clayton's doing well
in Baltimore, he enjoys it.

09:52.583 --> 09:57.781
I am thankful, I'm encouraging him
to apply for entry to

09:57.782 --> 10:00.661
Johns Hopkins to do a semester's
degree. That would be great.

10:00.662 --> 10:05.620
In electronics. Yeah.
So these are the... the houses?

10:05.621 --> 10:09.099
These are all the homes,
they're all exactly alike.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.580
The stairs... There's a young
German youth right there. Yes.

10:14.300 --> 10:18.858
Hello, Todd. And this is where
Todd grew up for six years.

10:18.859 --> 10:21.857
So does this bring back
fond memories for you?

10:21.858 --> 10:25.217
It's amazing being back here.
Is it? It's a lot smaller.

10:25.218 --> 10:27.578
Really? You remembered it bigger?

10:29.537 --> 10:32.016
And this home here
was the Peterson home.

10:32.017 --> 10:33.897
Right here? That is it. Mm-hm.

10:41.535 --> 10:43.534
Right, so you all live right here?

10:43.535 --> 10:47.413
Yes, I won't go further,
there's someone in her window. OK.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.173
But we lived here.

10:49.174 --> 10:52.534
The children's bedroom upstairs
and ours over there.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.332
And this is the home
of dear Elizabeth McKee Ratliff,

11:00.333 --> 11:01.611
our beloved friend.

11:01.612 --> 11:04.011
Right here?
This is it, yes, this is her home.

11:04.012 --> 11:07.130
And Liz lived here with...

11:07.131 --> 11:09.650
Margaret and Martha.
With Margaret and Martha,

11:09.651 --> 11:12.930
and Barbara, the nanny,
would live here with them.

11:12.931 --> 11:15.329
But of course,
she was not always here,

11:15.330 --> 11:18.569
she was sometimes out with
her family, with her friends.

11:18.570 --> 11:24.808
But they lived here
from... probably the end of 1983

11:24.809 --> 11:27.647
until Liz's death in
the fall of 1985.

11:27.648 --> 11:30.247
And we spent essentially
much of every day together.

11:30.248 --> 11:33.566
She and I were teachers together,
at the base school.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.166
And Sunday evening,
we had dinner here together.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.846
Mike came in later
because he went every day

11:38.847 --> 11:40.925
to the gymnasium at the air base.

11:40.926 --> 11:43.525
And he came in
perhaps 30 minutes later.

11:43.526 --> 11:48.924
We shared dinner,
then I took my two sons back home

11:48.925 --> 11:50.124
to put them in bed.

11:50.125 --> 11:53.843
Mike stayed here, as was customary
since George's death,

11:53.844 --> 11:55.723
to help clear the dishes perhaps,

11:55.724 --> 11:58.243
sometimes he'd read a story
to the children.

11:58.244 --> 12:01.002
Um, you know,
bring family comfort to them.

12:01.003 --> 12:05.841
And then he returned home to me,
got the... Rather, to our home.

12:05.842 --> 12:08.601
He came to collect
the automobile keys,

12:08.602 --> 12:11.481
he drove back here
in the automobile,

12:11.482 --> 12:14.520
Liz would have been
in her automobile.

12:14.521 --> 12:17.880
We American teachers have
the custom over here,

12:17.881 --> 12:21.319
if we need to have
automobile repair work done,

12:21.320 --> 12:24.199
one drives, a friend collects us
and brings us back home,

12:24.200 --> 12:25.798
that had been the arrangement.

12:25.799 --> 12:27.998
And I can confirm the fact
that he returned

12:27.999 --> 12:30.358
within 30 to 40 minutes
after that trip.

12:30.359 --> 12:32.757
Let me ask you a question.
Of course, yes.

12:32.758 --> 12:36.517
When they left your place,
the girls were here asleep, right?

12:36.518 --> 12:38.636
Or did they come home,
Martha and Margaret?

12:38.637 --> 12:41.076
Repeat your question, please.
No, the dinner was here.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.596
The dinner was here,
but when Mike took...

12:43.597 --> 12:45.515
My understanding is Mike took Liz...

12:45.516 --> 12:47.635
The girls would have been
sleeping upstairs.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.955
Who was watching the girls?

12:48.956 --> 12:50.955
They were probably alone
for 30 minutes.

12:50.956 --> 12:54.274
So you're talking how old were they?
I would have been... Several years.

12:54.275 --> 12:58.313
Two and one. Two and one?
And they would have been left alone?

12:58.314 --> 13:01.833
Yes, but probably she might have
notified a next-door neighbour

13:01.834 --> 13:03.594
and also, I was there.

13:04.953 --> 13:06.712
Up the street. OK.

13:06.713 --> 13:09.552
Let me ask an unpleasant question.
Yes.

13:09.553 --> 13:12.391
Is there any chance that Mike
was having an affair with her?

13:12.392 --> 13:15.191
My response would be absolutely not.

13:15.192 --> 13:17.670
It was a platonic relationship.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.550
Because I know all aspects
of his personality...

13:20.551 --> 13:26.469
Under no circumstances would he have
had a sexual relationship with her,

13:26.470 --> 13:28.389
he would have had a platonic,

13:28.390 --> 13:31.228
a loving, familial relationship
with her,

13:31.229 --> 13:34.548
and that... in my mind,

13:34.549 --> 13:37.747
in my heart, in my spirit,
under no circumstances,

13:37.748 --> 13:42.947
including even temporary insanity,
if that can strike all persons,

13:42.948 --> 13:47.227
under no circumstances would he have
taken her life or injured her.

14:03.184 --> 14:06.703
Is this how you pictured it, Ron?
No. No?

14:06.704 --> 14:10.702
I didn't realise it was this close.
It's very close. Yeah.

14:10.703 --> 14:13.582
Yeah, I thought it was
a lot further away,

14:13.583 --> 14:15.022
the way they were explaining to me.

14:15.023 --> 14:17.301
It's real close.

14:17.302 --> 14:19.661
Hello? Hi.

14:19.662 --> 14:22.420
Hi.
DOG BARKS

14:22.421 --> 14:25.700
Is it all right if we come in?
Yes, of course. Thank you.

14:25.701 --> 14:27.821
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

14:30.180 --> 14:33.539
Don't be afraid of the dog.
Oh, no, no, no. He's just barking.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.138
But I understood that she had
a stroke, up there. Yeah.

14:37.139 --> 14:41.697
And then she fell down and obviously
broke her neck. I really don't know.

14:41.698 --> 14:43.017
OK.

14:43.018 --> 14:48.176
I know that my neighbours up there,
they still were talking that it was

14:48.177 --> 14:54.376
kind of funny and mysterious and
I think the baby-sitter found her.

14:54.377 --> 14:55.655
Yes, yes.

14:55.656 --> 14:59.655
Hello, guten Tag. Guten Tag,
wie geht es Ihnen heute?

14:59.656 --> 15:03.134
SHE SPEAKS GERMAN

15:03.135 --> 15:08.054
And hello. You are most kind.
Never mind. It's OK. Thank you.

15:10.614 --> 15:13.134
So... Are you OK?

15:19.853 --> 15:22.812
278 centimetres.

15:28.931 --> 15:32.091
16. Yeah.

15:34.930 --> 15:38.969
This is the first time I've been in
the home since that period of time.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.408
Is that right, since she died? Yes.

15:41.409 --> 15:45.528
And when Barbara first came in
and found her and was with her

15:45.529 --> 15:49.087
for perhaps five minutes
and then came to collect me

15:49.088 --> 15:53.087
and I ran immediately, and Liz was
still in the same position.

15:53.088 --> 15:56.846
And then Michael immediately,
within a few minutes,

15:56.847 --> 16:00.165
telephoned the military police
and she was...

16:00.166 --> 16:02.445
Now that I see the staircase,

16:02.446 --> 16:05.765
she could have even been
on the first or second stair.

16:05.766 --> 16:08.044
I was sitting here the entire time

16:08.045 --> 16:11.884
that the Polizei and
the military police were in the home

16:11.885 --> 16:15.003
and I was sitting here
directly observing

16:15.004 --> 16:18.963
when the German medical examiner
took the spinal tap

16:18.964 --> 16:22.402
and held the contents up so that
he could view them and that...

16:22.403 --> 16:25.961
Even from this distance, I could see
that it did not look clear.

16:25.962 --> 16:28.281
And that's when he
made the statement,

16:28.282 --> 16:29.801
right there by her body,

16:29.802 --> 16:33.360
in my presence, that she had died
of a cerebral haemorrhage.

16:33.361 --> 16:37.200
There was nothing out of place
except she was no longer living.

16:37.201 --> 16:40.919
Everything was as one would have
walked into a normal home.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.239
You know,
there was no pool of blood,

16:43.240 --> 16:45.079
there were no... Spatters.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.918
There could have been
a few spatters here.

16:47.919 --> 16:53.277
But so small that they did not
register with me. OK, so, like this?

16:53.278 --> 16:55.597
Yes. Position me exactly.

16:55.598 --> 17:00.156
OK, if you turn here and the feet
were something like right here.

17:00.157 --> 17:03.316
Just turned a little...
she was turned sideways.

17:03.317 --> 17:06.675
She was turned on her side,
facing upwards. Facing that way.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.194
Yes, like that. OK.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.594
Except this arm was more under her,
as I recall.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.753
Something like this? And this arm
would have been more like this.

17:14.755 --> 17:17.953
You are more at an angle
and her position was more linear.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.833
More straight? More linear.
At a diagonal. Like that. Yes.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.153
But you take up four stairs

17:23.154 --> 17:25.392
and she would have only taken up
three stairs

17:25.393 --> 17:30.992
and her head was lower
and her head was more on this angle.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.911
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

17:43.271 --> 17:45.950
MARCHING BAND PLAYS

18:13.866 --> 18:14.985
What was your sense...?

18:14.986 --> 18:18.384
Other than attending the parties
at Mike and Patty's house,

18:18.385 --> 18:22.783
did you have any sense of what their
relationship was like at the time?

18:22.784 --> 18:26.423
I saw them as
a perfectly normal couple.

18:26.424 --> 18:28.503
Not anything unusual.

18:28.504 --> 18:34.782
Did you ever see Mike lose his
temper at Patty or get angry?

18:34.783 --> 18:38.981
Oh, no, we were never in a situation
where that would have happened.

18:38.982 --> 18:40.501
This is Liz here? Mm-hm.

18:40.502 --> 18:43.861
And that's the oldest daughter
with her, Margaret? Mm-hm.

18:45.981 --> 18:49.499
Which one's Liz? On the right.
On the right. May I see it?

18:49.500 --> 18:53.019
Is this about what she looked like
when she died?

18:53.020 --> 18:54.619
Is this close to when she died?

18:54.620 --> 18:57.338
Mm-hm. Because you can tell
by the age of the girl.

18:57.339 --> 18:59.499
One girl was two
and one was one. OK.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.777
That's Patty, of course,
because look,

19:02.778 --> 19:05.137
here I see Patty and Liz
side-by-side.

19:05.138 --> 19:06.777
This could have been Liz.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.976
If I had not seen
this other picture,

19:08.977 --> 19:11.496
I would have taken this for Liz.

19:11.497 --> 19:16.216
How close they looked. See?
Look at this - Patty, Liz.

19:17.936 --> 19:21.614
Who's that there? Is that Mike?
That's Mike. Oh, wow!

19:21.615 --> 19:24.134
This is after George had died?

19:24.135 --> 19:27.574
I would think so, otherwise...
And which one is Liz now?

19:27.575 --> 19:32.373
The one standing up? Yeah.
But look how close...

19:32.374 --> 19:36.852
From our perspective,
given what the police think,

19:36.853 --> 19:40.572
what we're concerned about is
did she ever say anything to you

19:40.573 --> 19:44.171
that would have led you to believe
she had some affair with Mike

19:44.172 --> 19:46.771
or illicit relationship with Mike?

19:46.772 --> 19:50.370
No. That's the first time
I hear this. OK.

19:50.371 --> 19:53.290
We have to ask the question.
Yeah, I know.

19:53.291 --> 19:56.249
But that would have been
so far-fetched that even if

19:56.250 --> 19:59.089
she had said that, I'd have said,
"Are you crazy?"

19:59.090 --> 20:00.608
And I don't think...

20:00.609 --> 20:05.848
See, the friendship between Patty
and Liz was such a friendship

20:05.849 --> 20:09.647
that you wouldn't dare ruin your
friendship over something like that.

20:09.648 --> 20:11.887
And that's the way Liz believed

20:11.888 --> 20:15.366
and that's the way I believe
with my close friends

20:15.367 --> 20:17.606
because I risk the friendship.

20:17.607 --> 20:21.445
And to me, the friendship
is worth more than a man.

20:21.446 --> 20:23.205
I can find a man somewhere else.

20:23.206 --> 20:25.405
But then I still have
that friendship.

20:25.406 --> 20:26.924
Makes me feel real good.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.244
No, but would you risk
a friendship...

20:29.245 --> 20:31.924
You're asking the wrong person.
..that went on for years?

20:31.925 --> 20:33.603
You're asking the wrong person.

20:33.604 --> 20:36.763
It takes time to build a friendship,
and when it lasts for years...

20:36.764 --> 20:40.243
It depends on how fast you talk.
Ah, no.

21:14.038 --> 21:16.918
This is the District Attorney's
office? Yeah.

21:18.917 --> 21:23.437
What's the handwriting on the back
there? Is that anything?

21:24.717 --> 21:28.035
Oh, yes, it's a decision
of my colleague

21:28.036 --> 21:31.914
who says I'm putting an end
to this case. Ah, OK.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.674
It's finished.
Do we get a copy of this?

21:34.675 --> 21:36.714
Yes. Yes, I see. There it is.

21:36.715 --> 21:39.713
And I have the name of the doctor.
OK.

21:39.714 --> 21:44.273
It was a long year.
16 years, 17 years. Yes. Yes.

21:44.274 --> 21:45.952
Thank you.

21:45.953 --> 21:49.993
HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN

21:59.791 --> 22:01.790
Because there is a trial
in the United States,

22:01.791 --> 22:07.150
because of murder, homicide,
which is the prosecution?

22:08.470 --> 22:11.108
It's a homicide case
in the United States.

22:11.109 --> 22:13.068
A homicide case
in the United States.

22:13.069 --> 22:14.548
Where is it in the States?

22:14.549 --> 22:18.547
In North Carolina.
North Carolina? Yes. OK.

22:18.548 --> 22:22.707
Thank you very much. No problem.
Thank you. Good luck.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.627
Have a good day. Goodbye.

22:36.665 --> 22:40.784
The body was given to the MPs

22:40.785 --> 22:44.663
and any following investigation

22:44.664 --> 22:47.944
will be conducted
by the CID Darmstadt.

22:49.184 --> 22:53.182
He realised that there is blood

22:53.183 --> 22:57.702
inside the fluid... spinal fluid.

22:58.902 --> 23:02.420
OK, cause of death - natural death,

23:02.421 --> 23:06.540
due to blood inside the brain.

23:06.541 --> 23:07.940
OK, yeah. Haemorrhage.

23:07.941 --> 23:12.099
Is it unusual for the doctor to go
to the place of a death?

23:12.100 --> 23:14.539
No, they always go. OK.

23:14.540 --> 23:21.458
Every accident, the German law says
they must be attended by

23:21.459 --> 23:28.577
a doctor and he has to give his
medical examine, you know? OK.

23:29.977 --> 23:32.096
And there was no foul play,

23:32.097 --> 23:34.816
that's why they quit
the investigations.

23:34.817 --> 23:36.016
OK.

23:42.975 --> 23:45.815
Hey, Michael. How are you? I'm back.

23:48.014 --> 23:50.614
If I never go to Germany again,
it'll be OK.

23:52.694 --> 23:56.932
All I could think about
as I watched these German men

23:56.933 --> 24:02.852
marching in this parade on Saturday
was what they were doing in 1942.

24:04.452 --> 24:08.970
Yes, exactly.
Or guarding somebody who I knew.

24:08.971 --> 24:10.491
Yes.

24:12.171 --> 24:15.850
Sunday, we first interviewed
Barbara.

24:17.290 --> 24:21.728
Yeah, there were a couple of things
that she said that, you know,

24:21.729 --> 24:24.048
if they are true, are troubling.

24:24.049 --> 24:28.407
She claimed there was a lot of blood
all around the stairway

24:28.408 --> 24:30.688
and the bottom of the hallway.

24:32.448 --> 24:35.246
You know, when Liz was lying there.

24:35.247 --> 24:37.766
And Patty says that's just not true.

24:37.767 --> 24:42.206
There's no indication of that
in any of the police reports.

24:44.046 --> 24:47.124
But she, you know,
was very firm about that, you know,

24:47.125 --> 24:51.604
blood on the wall, blood underneath
the stairs, you know,

24:51.605 --> 24:55.844
she told me she'd been cleaning
blood up for weeks afterwards.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.120
All right, um...

25:23.440 --> 25:25.040
On the exhumation.

25:26.399 --> 25:32.117
Apparently Hardin told Barbara
in an e-mail to her,

25:32.118 --> 25:36.277
told her that they were
exhuming Liz's body.

25:36.278 --> 25:41.556
Right now, we're just basing it
on what Barbara told us

25:41.557 --> 25:45.555
that Hardin told her,
and I don't want to...

25:45.556 --> 25:49.035
What I'd like you to do, then,
is talk to Hardin and say,

25:49.036 --> 25:53.314
"Jim, we don't personally have
any objection", although again,

25:53.315 --> 25:54.754
what's the fucking grounds?

25:54.755 --> 25:56.154
Can people just go dig up graves?

25:56.155 --> 25:59.633
What Hardin claimed was
that they had permission

25:59.634 --> 26:02.273
from Liz's mother and sister.

26:02.274 --> 26:04.273
What, aren't the closest
relatives...?

26:04.274 --> 26:06.192
I don't want to get into
a pissing contest,

26:06.193 --> 26:08.392
what about their daughter?
I don't know.

26:08.393 --> 26:12.551
You know, it may be ugly, it may be
terrible, but the bottom line is

26:12.552 --> 26:16.111
it's going to help end up helping...
You know... I understand that.

26:16.112 --> 26:19.710
If everything is as we think it is,
it's going to help us. I know.

26:19.711 --> 26:24.109
But normally, look, I've seen enough
dead bodies and copses and graves

26:24.110 --> 26:25.469
that it doesn't...

26:25.470 --> 26:28.669
You know, I have no moral problem
with this, but again,

26:28.670 --> 26:32.348
as I wrote you,
Liz was a very good friend of mine.

26:32.349 --> 26:35.748
And you know, I've been with
the Ratliff family

26:35.749 --> 26:37.187
since George died.

26:37.188 --> 26:40.827
Jesus, you know,
the Grenada invasion in 1981.

26:40.828 --> 26:44.786
21... I mean, these people have been
going through an immense amount.

26:44.787 --> 26:47.746
And... it's just...

26:47.747 --> 26:49.626
I just don't know and
I can't imagine

26:49.627 --> 26:51.425
what Margaret and Martha
would think.

26:51.426 --> 26:52.865
"Oh, by the way, your Aunt Margaret

26:52.866 --> 26:56.465
"decided to dig up your mother -
just because."

26:56.466 --> 26:57.704
Oh, Christ!

26:57.705 --> 27:01.664
So if you could work it out with
Holland, or Harlen, or Hardin, look,

27:01.665 --> 27:03.903
so that I won't tell the girls,

27:03.904 --> 27:07.703
but before they do it, I'm certainly
going to have to tell the girls.

27:07.704 --> 27:09.063
And you might say...

27:09.064 --> 27:12.502
You might also, Jim, want to talk
to the girls, you know -

27:12.503 --> 27:16.741
the sister's one thing, but
the daughters are another matter.

27:16.742 --> 27:19.621
I really don't want to
give in to them. OK.

27:19.622 --> 27:24.940
I don't want to get into
a pissing match with Hardin

27:24.941 --> 27:27.540
over who did they
get permission from

27:27.541 --> 27:30.539
and who should they
have got permission from.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.859
I mean,
that's just a battle that...

27:32.860 --> 27:36.978
A, I don't want to fight,
and B, we're not going to win.

27:36.979 --> 27:40.818
Fine, but I guess now we're
strictly talking the law here.

27:40.819 --> 27:43.177
Can people just go
and dig up graves?

27:43.178 --> 27:47.217
It's one thing when they go in
and go swab Kathleen's vagina.

27:47.218 --> 27:50.536
Now, we're talking... You know,
that's macabre and sick.

27:50.537 --> 27:53.176
They go in there
after Kathleen's autopsy,

27:53.177 --> 27:55.895
two days later, she's in there,
they all rush into her body

27:55.896 --> 27:58.055
and we're doing that,
which was disgusting.

27:58.056 --> 28:01.135
And now we're digging up a body.
I just... I don't like it.

28:01.136 --> 28:03.734
I know. But I mean, I understand it.

28:03.735 --> 28:05.854
So just work it out with Hardin,

28:05.855 --> 28:08.573
at least I can notify
Margaret and Martha

28:08.574 --> 28:10.933
that their mom's going to be dug up.

28:10.934 --> 28:11.974
I understand.

28:12.974 --> 28:14.014
I understand.

28:24.412 --> 28:27.771
Morning. Morning, nice to see you.
How are you? Good, good.

28:29.211 --> 28:33.171
Good sleep? I did sleep, yes,
thank you, and you? Good.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.450
I'm so happy to see you.

28:41.289 --> 28:43.328
Do you want something to drink?

28:43.329 --> 28:46.648
Just a little water, yes,
that would be lovely. Ice?

PHONE RINGS

28:53.488 --> 28:55.806
Oh, my God, my attorney, Jesus!

28:55.807 --> 28:57.166
Hello.

28:57.167 --> 28:59.206
David.

28:59.207 --> 29:01.126
Fine, what's up?

29:02.966 --> 29:04.766
Go ahead.

29:06.765 --> 29:08.084
Well, that's what I thought.

29:08.085 --> 29:10.564
I thought that was the whole
purpose behind embalming

29:10.565 --> 29:11.765
was to preserve the body.

29:15.324 --> 29:17.523
So the expectation is
she's going to look

29:17.524 --> 29:19.723
exactly like she was
when she was buried.

29:21.243 --> 29:22.883
Well, that's what I thought.

29:25.363 --> 29:28.322
Yeah, you know,
she was buried in her wedding dress.

29:30.042 --> 29:32.721
So you want to see her
about seven o'clock. Bye.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.880
That was David saying...

29:36.881 --> 29:38.920
Is...? I beg your pardon.

29:38.921 --> 29:42.519
..that the exhumation is probably
going to be, you know,

29:42.520 --> 29:44.959
she's going to be
perfectly preserved.

29:44.960 --> 29:48.158
Indeed. Well, that's what
I would have thought.

29:48.159 --> 29:51.198
Well, I... had horrors
of other things that...

29:51.199 --> 29:55.317
Well, I think we did, but that's
the whole idea behind embalming

29:55.318 --> 30:00.516
and having this, you know,
sealed coffins and a vault in there,

30:00.517 --> 30:02.676
so that you are preserved for ever.

30:02.677 --> 30:03.996
Yes.

30:03.997 --> 30:06.755
I think, when Margaret
was sitting with me,

30:06.756 --> 30:08.515
we had a very good visit.

30:08.516 --> 30:12.754
And we sat down and we talked
for many, many hours.

30:12.755 --> 30:17.355
We talked through the entire night.
All of her hopes, dreams, fears.

30:18.594 --> 30:21.353
And with your trial approaching
closer and closer,

30:21.354 --> 30:23.953
I think everyone's anxiety
is growing more.

30:23.954 --> 30:25.512
When we were in Frankfurt,

30:25.513 --> 30:28.192
I took her up to the wonderful
lofty building

30:28.193 --> 30:30.872
from which you can view
all of Frankfurt.

30:30.873 --> 30:34.271
She developed
some severe anxiety about that.

30:34.272 --> 30:39.310
And obviously, this is all related
to her feelings for you, the father,

30:39.311 --> 30:42.510
you are her profound father figure,
obviously.

30:42.511 --> 30:45.629
But I think her anxiety is
perhaps increasing somewhat

30:45.630 --> 30:48.469
because she does not want
to suffer another loss.

30:48.470 --> 30:53.988
And we touched very briefly on
the exhumation of her mother.

30:53.989 --> 30:55.828
I did not use that word.

30:55.829 --> 30:57.707
I didn't use necessarily an epithet,

30:57.708 --> 31:00.067
but I didn't want to use
that word directly.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.946
But this, I feel,
would be a very profound

31:03.947 --> 31:06.907
and certainly
life-disturbing event for her.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.864
It was just a shock.
It was too overwhelming.

31:21.865 --> 31:26.063
It was... the most horrible thing
in the world. I don't know.

31:26.064 --> 31:29.702
It was like my worst nightmare
when I was little.

31:29.703 --> 31:33.502
You know, you'd have nightmares of,
like, your mother,

31:33.503 --> 31:36.781
your parents coming back alive and,
like, what they would look like.

31:36.782 --> 31:40.421
You know, just typical
childhood nightmares.

31:40.422 --> 31:42.461
It was like it was coming true.

31:42.462 --> 31:45.140
It was my worst nightmare
in the world coming true.

31:45.141 --> 31:46.900
It was horrible.

31:46.901 --> 31:52.819
The fact that we had to sign it,
too, was... kind of traumatising.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.379
You know, we had to sign this sheet
that would release our...

31:58.019 --> 32:03.537
It would have them dig up our mother
and examine her body.

32:03.538 --> 32:05.097
It's horrible.

32:05.098 --> 32:09.417
It's the most... horrible thing
I could ever have imagined.

32:13.337 --> 32:18.095
My first gut reaction was no.
"No way, no chance in hell.

32:18.096 --> 32:20.495
"I'm not going to let this happen."

32:20.496 --> 32:22.654
But then I sat down
and I thought about it

32:22.655 --> 32:24.814
and realised that, you know...

32:24.815 --> 32:26.334
And Dad didn't even talk
to us about it.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.214
He just told us, you know...

32:28.215 --> 32:33.133
He asked us, basically,
whether it was OK with us.

32:33.134 --> 32:38.052
When I talked to Martha,
I just realised that we had to.

32:38.053 --> 32:43.371
I mean, obviously, it would show
that Dad didn't do anything.

32:43.372 --> 32:45.571
You know, it would give
even more proof to the fact

32:45.572 --> 32:49.131
that Dad is innocent of everything.

32:53.531 --> 33:00.808
The last trip Liz Ratliff,
nee McKee, made was in a hearse.

33:00.809 --> 33:03.208
She had ridden in others -

33:03.209 --> 33:06.888
the first after she died, 1985.

33:06.889 --> 33:09.487
She had been transported from
her home, where she'd died,

33:09.488 --> 33:12.087
to the hospital for her autopsy.

33:12.088 --> 33:14.726
Then there was a hearse ride from
the hospital to the airport

33:14.727 --> 33:16.446
for her return to the United States,

33:16.447 --> 33:22.605
in what was presumably
her last hearse journey,

33:22.606 --> 33:25.286
from the mortuary to the grave.

33:27.045 --> 33:32.004
However, 18 years later,
she made another trip.

33:32.005 --> 33:35.003
This one, a 1,200-mile journey
across middle America

33:35.004 --> 33:37.043
in the back of a hearse,

33:37.044 --> 33:38.764
travelling from her grave...

33:40.083 --> 33:43.243
..to North Carolina
for another autopsy.

33:53.321 --> 33:56.160
What they're looking for,
I'm really not sure.

33:56.161 --> 33:59.839
The woman has been buried
for 17 years.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.279
The autopsy, the investigation,

34:02.280 --> 34:05.639
everything that was conducted
back in Germany

34:05.640 --> 34:09.277
ruled that it was an accident,

34:09.279 --> 34:11.878
she had a cerebral haemorrhage.

34:11.879 --> 34:13.077
This is crazy.

34:13.078 --> 34:15.317
Absolutely crazy.

34:15.318 --> 34:21.077
Disturbing a woman after 17 years
for some wild guess, I guess.

34:26.275 --> 34:29.114
We're not concerned about it,
cos we know what happened.

34:29.116 --> 34:34.714
We're disturbed that they feel it
necessary to exhume the body

34:34.715 --> 34:36.275
and disturb her peace.

34:38.114 --> 34:42.234
The two girls, Martha and Margaret,
are pretty well disturbed about it.

34:59.551 --> 35:01.391
A little bit farther down.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.030
All right. OK.

35:20.188 --> 35:23.427
Oh, the flat headstones? OK.

35:23.428 --> 35:25.906
I think I see her right here,
there's four stakes in the ground.

35:25.907 --> 35:28.146
Who's buried next to her? George?

35:28.147 --> 35:30.027
OK.

35:52.143 --> 35:54.782
They were married for
a very short period of time.

35:54.783 --> 35:58.901
They've been laying together here,
side by side, for 17 years.

35:58.902 --> 36:02.421
Now they're going to move her out.

36:02.422 --> 36:04.741
I know that captain
would raise hell.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.621
This is crazy.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.644
Three, two, one.

37:50.645 --> 37:53.923
The DA thinks there's enough
similarities between the two deaths

37:53.924 --> 37:56.763
that they've had Elizabeth Ratliff's
body exhumed from the ch...

37:56.764 --> 37:58.484
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

38:03.923 --> 38:07.641
Three, two, one.

38:07.642 --> 38:09.921
The DA thinks there's enough
similarities

38:09.922 --> 38:12.841
between the two deaths they've had
Ratliff's body exhumed

38:12.842 --> 38:14.640
from the cemetery here in Texas

38:14.641 --> 38:18.641
and brought to the medical
examiner's office in Chapel Hill.

38:25.720 --> 38:29.678
A little water in there.
That's condensation. Yeah.

38:29.679 --> 38:33.238
That's a great shame. Yeah.

38:38.918 --> 38:39.957
My first.

38:56.275 --> 38:58.833
Ratliff's body will be guarded
the entire time

38:58.834 --> 39:00.753
it heads back to Chapel Hill.

39:00.754 --> 39:03.353
That vehicle will be followed
by Durham investigators,

39:03.354 --> 39:05.672
and even when they spend the night
in Alabama tonight,

39:05.673 --> 39:08.192
there will be guards
looking over the body.

39:08.193 --> 39:12.751
She's expected to be back here...
No, she - I can't say "she".

39:12.752 --> 39:15.631
Three, two, one.

39:15.632 --> 39:18.270
Have you got a long drive back?

39:18.271 --> 39:20.151
We have a very long drive back.

39:22.511 --> 39:24.589
Anything else you want to tell us?
Nope.

39:24.590 --> 39:26.109
SHE LAUGHS

39:26.110 --> 39:28.189
Thank you.

39:28.190 --> 39:29.470
Well...

39:30.790 --> 39:32.468
..y'all ready?

39:32.469 --> 39:35.748
In what shape is it?

39:35.749 --> 39:39.347
It's in great shape.
Great shape? Great shape.

39:39.348 --> 39:42.187
We didn't know what to expect,
but things went well.

39:42.188 --> 39:43.468
Things went very well.

40:52.377 --> 40:54.856
Up until the death of Kathleen,

40:54.857 --> 40:57.415
I really didn't know
who Michael Peterson was,

40:57.416 --> 40:58.975
other than being a writer.

40:58.976 --> 41:01.376
Um...

41:02.375 --> 41:03.974
..and a military veteran.

41:03.975 --> 41:08.774
I didn't know him personally.
I didn't know his character.

41:12.014 --> 41:13.853
Who can do something like that?

41:13.854 --> 41:17.252
Somebody that's got
a very, very bad temper.

41:17.253 --> 41:23.651
Talking with witnesses and some of
Elizabeth Ratliff's family members,

41:23.652 --> 41:25.772
he's got a very bad temper.

41:27.892 --> 41:30.490
A lot of people that I interviewed

41:30.491 --> 41:32.210
said that they were
the perfect couple.

41:32.211 --> 41:34.010
"I wish I had a husband like that."

41:34.011 --> 41:38.289
But... going back to the materials

41:38.290 --> 41:41.608
that we found in his computer
and in his home,

41:41.609 --> 41:44.409
he was not a happily married man
to Kathleen Peterson.

41:48.568 --> 41:50.408
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

41:51.888 --> 41:55.686
Hello. Hey. How are you?

41:55.687 --> 41:58.006
Everything went swell.

41:58.007 --> 42:02.205
The vault was intact,
as well as the casket.

42:02.206 --> 42:04.165
We're in Louisiana.

42:04.166 --> 42:07.124
No. No, no, no,
the casket has not been opened.

42:07.125 --> 42:11.404
We're not touching that.
No, no, that'll be opened Wednesday.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.284
Anyway, I'm very optimistic

42:13.285 --> 42:17.523
about what our findings
are going to be, Wednesday.

42:17.524 --> 42:22.322
That was Elizabeth's sister,
Margaret Blair.

42:22.323 --> 42:23.603
She lives in Rhode Island.

43:31.952 --> 43:33.752
I expect him to be found guilty...

43:35.832 --> 43:37.152
..of killing his wife.

43:38.511 --> 43:42.070
And I think,
after the autopsy tomorrow,

43:42.071 --> 43:46.869
people will have issues, I think,

43:46.870 --> 43:49.349
with the result of that
as far as his involvement

43:49.350 --> 43:51.469
with the death of Elizabeth Ratliff.

44:08.707 --> 44:10.826
We home. We home.

44:20.465 --> 44:24.023
They could have had that autopsy
done in Texas.

44:24.024 --> 44:25.943
We suggested that they did it
in Texas

44:25.944 --> 44:28.383
with a neutral forensic pathologist,

44:28.384 --> 44:32.102
and there are some world-class
forensic pathologists

44:32.103 --> 44:34.822
there in Texas
who could have done that.

44:34.823 --> 44:39.421
Instead, what the prosecutors did
was they spent thousands of dollars

44:39.422 --> 44:44.820
transporting her body 1,200 miles
from Bay City, Texas, to Chapel Hill

44:44.821 --> 44:49.220
in order to allow Deborah Radisch,
who had already concluded

44:49.221 --> 44:52.939
that Kathleen Peterson's death
was not accidental,

44:52.940 --> 44:56.219
to perform the autopsy
on Elizabeth Ratliff.
