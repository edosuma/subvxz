We'll stop here.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.539
My people will treat you
like a princess, Princess.

01:05.540 --> 01:06.874
Galavant: Don't get too comfortable.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.243
One night, Sid. Then we hit the road.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.749
So, this is it, my hometown.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.084
A little background on the place...

01:17.085 --> 01:20.153
Middle-class community,
lots of sheep-sheering,

01:20.154 --> 01:22.022
great place to raise a family.

01:22.023 --> 01:23.457
That should cover it.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.959
Sounds lovely, Sid. One tiny question.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.662
- Shoot.
- What the hell is that?

01:28.663 --> 01:30.397
"Sidneyland"?

01:34.802 --> 01:38.074
Ah, you noticed that.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.810
All hail Sid!

01:43.811 --> 01:46.880
The conquering hero returns!

01:46.881 --> 01:48.281
Huzzah!

01:48.282 --> 01:49.783
- Sid.
- Yeah.

01:49.784 --> 01:51.118
What is happening?

01:51.119 --> 01:53.220
Well, I'm adopted.

01:53.221 --> 01:56.723
When I was a baby, an older couple
found me on their doorstep and took me in.

01:56.724 --> 01:59.159
You know the expression
"it takes a village"?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.328
No. No. No, I don't think
that's been invented yet.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.495
Oh. Autograph, please!

02:02.496 --> 02:03.597
[Laughs]

02:03.598 --> 02:05.699
Well, I was a golden child around here.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.402
And over the years, when I wrote home,
I <i> may</i> have exaggerated a bit.

02:10.404 --> 02:11.805
Mm!

02:12.824 --> 02:15.975
Oh, I wish you were my cousin
so I could marry you.

02:15.977 --> 02:18.378
Aw, that's so sweet!

02:18.379 --> 02:19.879
[Chuckles]

02:19.880 --> 02:22.315
I know this is unusual, but
it would mean the world to me

02:22.316 --> 02:24.751
if you could go along with this
for just one night.

02:24.752 --> 02:27.587
Play along? Do you mean, like, act?

02:27.588 --> 02:29.422
Did you know that my
hometown of Valencia

02:29.423 --> 02:30.623
is famous for two things...

02:30.624 --> 02:33.426
Our cabbage festival
and our theater program.

02:33.427 --> 02:35.095
So, worst place ever.

02:35.096 --> 02:37.263
You should have just said
"worst place ever." [Sighs]

02:37.264 --> 02:39.432
Every night, we'd gather
around the town elder tree

02:39.433 --> 02:41.935
with nothing but the power
of our imaginations.

02:41.936 --> 02:45.105
Sometimes, we wouldn't even
have a script that night.

02:45.106 --> 02:46.840
So we'd have to find our characters

02:46.841 --> 02:48.508
over the course of many,
many hours of theater.

02:48.509 --> 02:50.176
You sure you want to save this place?

02:50.177 --> 02:51.845
Sid, I'm in.

02:51.846 --> 02:54.047
Get ready. My parents are a lot.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.949
- Of what?
- Everything.

02:57.618 --> 02:59.619
Oh, and one more thing.
They think you're my squire.

02:59.620 --> 03:00.787
- [Gasps]
- What did he say?

03:00.788 --> 03:02.088
[Gasps]

03:02.089 --> 03:03.890
- Bubbala!
- My boy!

03:03.891 --> 03:05.058
[Laughing]

03:05.059 --> 03:06.392
- Oh!
- Oh!

03:08.128 --> 03:10.296
Come in! Come in!

03:10.297 --> 03:13.266
- You kids must be starving.
- Famished.

03:13.267 --> 03:15.802
Glad to hear it. Get plucking, squire.

03:18.413 --> 03:19.772
Terrific.

03:22.845 --> 03:24.779
Come on, Jester! Do the bit that I wrote!

03:24.780 --> 03:26.608
You guys are going to love this.

03:26.649 --> 03:29.349
It feels a little inappropriate,
considering the circumstances.

03:29.351 --> 03:30.418
Just do the bit.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.386
Please, sir.

03:31.387 --> 03:32.620
Do the bit.

03:35.157 --> 03:36.991
Hey, Valencians.

03:36.993 --> 03:39.560
How many Valencians
does it take to win a war?

03:39.561 --> 03:40.795
How many?

03:40.796 --> 03:41.896
More than you had.

03:41.897 --> 03:43.898
[Laughing]

03:45.167 --> 03:46.467
Oh, have mercy.

03:46.468 --> 03:47.769
I'm bored. I'm leaving.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.170
Oh, my wife.

03:49.171 --> 03:50.805
Now, I know we've had our ups and downs.

03:50.806 --> 03:52.373
Why, just a few days ago,

03:52.374 --> 03:54.242
you made me cry so hard
I could barely breathe.

03:54.243 --> 03:55.376
Tell her, Gareth.

03:55.377 --> 03:56.978
Eight hours of my life I can't get back.

03:56.979 --> 03:58.579
I mean, but that's our thing.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.449
That's us. I'm not giving up on us.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.717
- I want you to give up.
- No.

04:02.718 --> 04:04.507
- Please give up.
- You can't make me.

04:05.087 --> 04:07.321
[Sighs] God, everyone's in such moods.

04:07.322 --> 04:10.091
King and queen of Valencia, step forward.

04:11.593 --> 04:12.460
Let me ask you...

04:12.462 --> 04:15.463
Before I invaded, pillaged,
and destroyed your kingdom,

04:15.464 --> 04:17.130
what did you people
do around here for fun?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.000
We used to sit around the elder tree

04:19.000 --> 04:22.236
for hours and hours of
spontaneous, unscripted theater.

04:22.237 --> 04:23.637
Oof.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.706
You cut down the elder tree.

04:25.707 --> 04:27.641
- I did?
- You turned it into toothpicks.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.041
Well played. You're dismissed.

04:33.081 --> 04:35.149
Mm! Eunuch, front and center.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.817
Help me out.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.919
What else did you do around here for fun?

04:38.920 --> 04:41.455
I don't know. We, uh, used to have balls.

04:41.456 --> 04:42.690
[Both snicker]

04:42.691 --> 04:44.925
Gareth, did you hear what the eunuch said?

04:44.926 --> 04:47.261
You cannot write this stuff!

04:47.262 --> 04:48.796
You sure can't!

04:48.797 --> 04:49.797
[Both laugh]

04:49.798 --> 04:51.565
You know, I've always been curious.

04:51.566 --> 04:53.734
Do you still have any feeling, you know...

04:53.735 --> 04:54.969
Down there?

04:54.970 --> 04:56.670
- No, sir.
- Really?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.506
Gareth, go take a whack at the eunuch.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.842
Lovely.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.745
Spread 'em.

05:06.114 --> 05:07.748
[Thud]

05:07.749 --> 05:09.442
That is amazing!

05:09.444 --> 05:10.733
Gareth, isn't that amazing?

05:10.735 --> 05:11.936
It's really cool!

05:11.938 --> 05:14.788
Everyone, line up.
Take a free shot at the eunuch.

05:14.789 --> 05:17.524
You know, honey,

05:17.525 --> 05:19.626
let's throw these poor bastards a ball,

05:19.627 --> 05:23.097
breathe some life back into the place,
get some food and music and entertainment.

05:23.098 --> 05:25.632
I should probably start working
up a routine with the Jester...

05:25.633 --> 05:28.671
- In my bedchamber, where it's quiet.
- That's the spirit!

05:28.673 --> 05:31.305
Now, I don't want either one
of you to leave your bedchamber

05:31.306 --> 05:33.073
until you've worked out a complete set.

05:33.074 --> 05:36.210
Oh, I think I have a set
the Jester can work with.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.778
Fantastic!

05:37.779 --> 05:39.179
[Giggles]

05:39.180 --> 05:41.247
Oh, this is going to be such a hoot!

05:41.249 --> 05:42.849
Oh, come on, people!

05:42.850 --> 05:45.419
Don't pull your punches! Have fun with it!

05:45.420 --> 05:46.553
Get creative!

05:46.554 --> 05:48.221
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

05:48.222 --> 05:49.923
Nothing.

05:49.924 --> 05:53.093
Your loss is our gain. And we thank you.

05:53.094 --> 05:54.728
[Smooches]

05:54.729 --> 05:57.531
Our Sidney.

05:57.532 --> 05:59.299
So handsome!

05:59.300 --> 06:01.535
We bought him that armor
for his 16th birthday.

06:01.536 --> 06:03.170
Cost us a fortune. [Chuckles]

06:03.171 --> 06:06.707
Sid, eat, eat. Y-you're wasting away!

06:06.708 --> 06:08.442
I'm fine, mother.

06:08.443 --> 06:10.510
Just humor me. [Chuckles]

06:10.511 --> 06:11.878
Squire?

06:11.879 --> 06:14.080
Squire!

06:14.081 --> 06:15.749
Oh, right. That's me.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.018
Don't tell me your squire
is as dimwitted as <i> our</i> squire.

06:18.019 --> 06:20.921
[Laughs loudly]

06:20.922 --> 06:22.689
I think he may be.

06:22.690 --> 06:25.091
You've got nice teeth.

06:25.092 --> 06:27.127
So, tell us about
your new lady friend, Sid.

06:27.129 --> 06:29.897
- Uh, father, this is Princess Isabella.
- [Chuckles]

06:29.897 --> 06:32.899
[Gasping]

06:32.900 --> 06:34.367
A princess?

06:34.368 --> 06:35.435
That's my boy!

06:35.436 --> 06:37.237
Oh, uh, Princess Isabella isn...

06:37.238 --> 06:39.172
Oh, the first time I saw your son,

06:39.173 --> 06:40.874
it was a dark and cloudy day,

06:40.875 --> 06:45.211
but your son with an "O"
was my sun with a "U."

06:48.349 --> 06:49.783
We don't know how to read.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.217
Not a word.

06:51.218 --> 06:53.486
[Chuckles] We're engaged.

06:53.487 --> 06:55.355
This just took a fun turn.

06:55.356 --> 06:56.689

wants to draw you,

to help set up the party!

10:51.857 --> 10:54.993
Uh, uh, oh, well, my... my research shows

10:54.994 --> 10:58.129
that the Valencians have
religious aversions to meat,

10:58.130 --> 11:01.232
and they live almost entirely
off their own crops.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.701
How resourceful.

11:02.702 --> 11:04.202
It was, My King.

11:04.203 --> 11:07.138
Unfortunately, you burned all
their crops during the invasion.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.407
- Yeah?
- You set their fields ablaze

11:09.408 --> 11:11.743

to all the lands, uh...

18:54.721 --> 18:56.689
[High-pitched voice] Oh, yes, I'm
wearing tights! I'm so dainty!

18:56.690 --> 18:57.990
[Laughter]

18:57.991 --> 19:02.094
He'd have to be blind not to know that his
wife's getting it on with the Jester!

19:02.095 --> 19:05.164
[Laughs] [Laughter stops]

19:09.069 --> 19:10.636
Am I right?!

19:12.439 --> 19:15.441
Party's over.

19:15.442 --> 19:16.942
And, Gareth, kill the eunuch.

19:17.864 --> 19:19.765
[Execution prelude plays]

19:21.248 --> 19:23.082
[Indistinct conversations]

19:23.083 --> 19:25.584
A word, my... liege.

19:25.585 --> 19:28.254
Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

19:28.255 --> 19:30.856
Squires.

19:30.857 --> 19:34.226
[Sighs] You have no idea
how mortified I am, sir.

19:34.227 --> 19:37.263
- I promise that tomorrow, I'm...
- Do you know why I hired you, Sid?

19:37.264 --> 19:38.798
I assumed you'd lost a bet.

19:38.799 --> 19:40.800
[Chuckles, sighs]

19:40.801 --> 19:42.701
Everyone else filled their résumés

19:42.702 --> 19:44.703
with skills that would impress me...

19:44.704 --> 19:48.040
Horse-shoeing or sword-sharpening.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.709
But you were yourself.
You told me who you were...

19:50.710 --> 19:52.645
A late sleeper and a lover of dolls.

19:52.646 --> 19:56.549
Figurines. <i>Detailed</i> figurines.

19:56.550 --> 19:58.617
Right, so, fancy dolls.

19:58.618 --> 20:01.554
But anyway, the point is,
it's the hardest thing in the world

20:01.555 --> 20:05.724
to find someone who is true to themselves,
and it's the thing I love most about you.

20:05.725 --> 20:07.660
- Did you just say you...
- Don't ruin this.

20:07.661 --> 20:10.496
It occurs to me that being a squire

20:10.497 --> 20:12.598
isn't a great job to begin with.

20:12.599 --> 20:15.434
And being mine is probably worse.

20:15.435 --> 20:17.102
[Chuckles] But you never complained.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.404
[Chuckles] Not once.

20:18.405 --> 20:21.006
You never abandoned me,
never spit in my ale.

20:22.509 --> 20:24.943
- Right? You've never done that.
- Of course not, sir.

20:24.944 --> 20:29.815
Look, I'll play any part you
want me to play here.

20:29.816 --> 20:32.151
But you should be proud
of the man you are.

20:32.152 --> 20:33.719
I know <i> I</i> certainly am.

20:40.593 --> 20:42.127
What was that?

20:42.128 --> 20:46.698
That, my lady, was a knight
getting off his high horse.

20:48.201 --> 20:51.270
Mom, dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

20:51.271 --> 20:54.239
Well, I'll be damned.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.374
I wouldn't drink that.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.676
Well, why not?
I've already drunk half of it.

20:57.677 --> 21:00.445
Yeah, just carry on. It's fine.
