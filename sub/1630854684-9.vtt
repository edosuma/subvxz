08:08.055 --> 08:10.023
Yeah, Meech.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.825
That nigga Shane's
one of my top earners, though.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.694
But it don't matter.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.530
Soon as that nigga get pinched
for raping somebody,

08:16.530 --> 08:18.232
he gonna start snitching
to save his own ass.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.700
<i>♪ I'm kind of stingy ♪</i>

08:19.700 --> 08:21.068
<i>♪ That's why I don't want
To lend ♪</i>

08:21.068 --> 08:22.970
<i>♪ A funky rhyme to a foe
or a good friend ♪</i>

08:37.084 --> 08:41.221
Look, Dad, I'm-I'm not
going to school.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.691
'Cause if Marcus
can get me here,

08:44.691 --> 08:46.860
then what is he gonna do
to me there?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.028
Look, I don't think
it was Marcus.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.563
Then who was it?

08:49.563 --> 08:50.564
I don't know.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.699
Look, sit down. Come on.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.970
I-I-I just don't think
that Marcus is stupid enough

08:56.970 --> 08:58.572
to break into a cop's house.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.873
Well, can you at least
just check

08:59.873 --> 09:01.942
for fingerprints and stuff
just in case?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.544
Of course. You know, I'll put
new locks on the doors

09:04.544 --> 09:07.147
and even add bars
to the windows, huh?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.817
Well...

09:10.817 --> 09:12.819
you got a new safe?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.187
Um...

09:16.623 --> 09:20.861
Look, don't let Marcus
have power over you.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.729
Superheroes always get
the bad guy.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.264
I mean, what would your, uh--

09:24.264 --> 09:26.300
what-what would
your Bruiser do?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.568
- Fight to live another day.
- That's right.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.905
He would fight
to live another day.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.815
Oh, look at that.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.784
Shit.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.185
Meech blackballed my ass.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.620
Man, this shit is funny.
You ever--

09:46.620 --> 09:47.821
I don't give a fuck about that.

09:49.656 --> 09:52.125
But this-this my favorite show,
and it's important to me.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.694
Man, I'm struggling
to offload these bricks.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.162
Niggas stopped hitting me
for taxes.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.197
Well, I guess something
is better than nothing.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.999
I ain't seen no goddamn rent.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.701
I ain't seen no fee
for cremating Blackie

10:00.701 --> 10:02.803
little fucking stinking ass,
and I'm just trying--

10:02.803 --> 10:03.870
I ain't paying for shit.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.972
<i>Fine.</i>

10:04.972 --> 10:06.039
Then stop interrupting me,

10:06.039 --> 10:08.041
and let me watch
my goddamn show.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.344
<i>Oh, sh--</i>

10:14.348 --> 10:16.016
What the fuck?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.051
Say something else. Go on.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.058
Uh, excuse me.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.760
<i>I'm Detective David Dublin,</i>

10:26.760 --> 10:28.729
but everybody around here
calls me Three-D.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.197
- Veronica Jin.
- Pleasure.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.000
- Hi.
- Hey, is, uh, Bryant around?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.068
Um, he just left his desk
for a second.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.069
Can I help you with something?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.138
Yeah.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.340
Oh, hey, Kevin.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.242
Come here. Come here. Sit down.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.944
Is everything okay?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.079
- I'll take it from here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:47.247 --> 10:48.915
Well...

10:48.915 --> 10:52.119
someone broke into our house,
and I think it was Marcus,

10:52.119 --> 10:54.021
the kid who's been bullying me,

10:54.021 --> 10:55.355
so I left school.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.024
Does your dad think it was him?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.126
No, he's saying
that it was somebody else.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.227
But I think
he's just saying that

11:00.227 --> 11:02.095
to get me to go back to school.

11:02.095 --> 11:05.298
Well, did you hear his voice
or see his face

11:05.298 --> 11:07.167
to make you think
it was Marcus?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.436
Well-well, no, but...

11:09.669 --> 11:11.238
we tussled for a little bit.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.174
And he-he put a pillowcase
over my head

11:14.174 --> 11:16.343
and threw me into the closet.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.714
Did he take anything?

11:20.714 --> 11:23.083
I don't think so, but...

11:23.083 --> 11:25.852
my dad did put
some more locks on the doors

11:25.852 --> 11:29.189
and he got a new safe, so...

11:29.189 --> 11:30.690
Yo.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.393
What happened to fight
to live another day?

11:33.393 --> 11:38.098
Dad, I don't feel safe
at home or in the school.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.399
I want to move back in
with Mom.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.835
Look, running away
from situations like this

11:41.835 --> 11:43.170
won't solve your problem.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.304
Dad, aren't you the one

11:44.304 --> 11:45.906
who's supposed to be
protecting people?

11:47.307 --> 11:48.809
So why can't you help
protect me?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.782
Fine. I'll call your mama.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.222
Okay.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.124
Well, that was the reaction
I was hoping to get

12:04.124 --> 12:05.826
when I got dressed
this morning.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.829
You look handsome.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.230
Thank you.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.000
They're beautiful.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.268
<i>I, um,</i>

12:15.268 --> 12:17.938
opened a college fund
for our daughter

12:17.938 --> 12:20.941
to ensure that she could pursue
all the dreams that she has.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.281
Thirty thousand do--

12:28.281 --> 12:32.085
Lamar.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.854
I don't know what to say.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.089
And I, uh--

12:36.089 --> 12:37.924
I got something else
for you as well.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.031
Lamar! I kn-I know
you not for real

12:45.031 --> 12:46.466
asking me to marry you
right now.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.137
No, look, we said we were
gonna go slow, right?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.304
A'ight, you-you ain't
gotta put this

12:51.304 --> 12:53.373
on your ring finger just yet,
a'ight?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.008
This is just me
promising to you

12:55.008 --> 12:57.444
that I'm gonna be
the best version of myself.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.153
Oh, wow.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.994
You not making this easy
at all.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.229
What? Ain't-ain't no need
for no tears, baby. What--

13:17.464 --> 13:19.266
It's time to celebrate.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.869
And I have
the perfect party favor.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.977
<i>♪ Ain't no looking back... ♪</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:32.946
<i>Goddamn.</i>

13:32.946 --> 13:34.347
Goldie living large, huh?

13:34.347 --> 13:37.050
That's
the only way to do it, baby.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.119
And I see y'all done made
some changes.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.221
Terry done got that shit
cut off the back his head.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.456
Yeah, I guess you could say

13:43.456 --> 13:44.824
we've been doing
some rebranding.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.026
And expanding.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.461
Who is this toothpick-looking
nigga over here?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.097
He family.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.232
<i>Hmm.</i>

13:53.099 --> 13:56.102
And this... is for your help
at the rim shop.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.606
Hoping...

13:59.839 --> 14:02.242
that you could let us clean
our money in one of your clubs.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.579
Hmm.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.347
You know, Meech,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.516
I only get down
with people I can trust.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.585
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- And y'all cute.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.286
<i>Damn if y'all ain't cute.</i>

14:14.421 --> 14:16.156
But we not quite there yet, baby.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.624
Shit, I brought your money

14:17.857 --> 14:19.893
without you even having
to ask for it.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.361
You did.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.462
But that's because
y'all didn't want me

14:22.462 --> 14:24.297
to have to dig up in that ass.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.168
Look, Goldie, please believe me
when we tell you

14:28.168 --> 14:30.136
that we've been hustling
to make contacts

14:30.136 --> 14:32.405
and trying to find
this new stash spot.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.041
All we need right now
is an olive branch.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.280
Okay. That damn smile.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.183
Okay, listen.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.986
There's a birthday gathering
tomorrow night at Magic City.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.520
And I can introduce y'all
to a few folks,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.322
including Stephanie.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.058
Now, Stephanie's one of the
biggest realtors in Atlanta.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.460
She used to dance for me.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.596
What, you running some type
of stripper success school?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.532
A stripper success school.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.036
Let me tell you something,
string-bean nigga.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.404
<i>That's just what I'm doing.</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:06.373
<i>See, when these girls
walk through my doors,</i>

15:06.373 --> 15:07.974
they think the most powerful
thing they have

15:07.974 --> 15:09.909
is in between they legs.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.945
But it's Goldie's job
to let them know

15:11.945 --> 15:15.248
they greatest asset
is on top of they shoulders.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.084
My bad.
I ain't mean no disrespect.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.452
None taken.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.688
I'm just schooling
your young, silly ass.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.393
Um, yeah, so can I use
the bathroom?

15:26.393 --> 15:27.460
You sure can, baby.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.095
It's down the hall
and to your left.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.301
Hey.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.502
<i>Hey!</i>

15:36.670 --> 15:38.071
Sorry about Kevin.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.206
No, it-it's cool, you know?

15:40.206 --> 15:42.609
My ex picked him up.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.078
Kid just ain't built like me.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.114
He told me about the break-in.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.650
He said that, uh, you thought
it was his bully.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.254
Yeah, you know, kid at school,
you know,

15:54.254 --> 15:55.655
he won't leave him alone.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.525
<i>Was anything taken?</i>

15:58.525 --> 16:00.026
Nah.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.528
No, I think he was just trying
to scare Kevin, you know?

16:01.528 --> 16:02.996
I'm not even gonna
file a report.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.431
I'm just gonna handle it
myself, you know?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.267
Maybe I should go with you
to roll up on this kid's house.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.403
Thank you, but, uh, I got it.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.406
Yeah, okay.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.642
Well, um,
it's probably for the best,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.577
with Garr breathing down
our backs and everything.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.012
<i>Well, has he heard anything</i>

16:19.012 --> 16:21.748
from the DEA's office
on the K-9 investigation?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.183
No.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.018
But I'll look into it
while you, uh,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.586
check out the bully thing.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.754
Cool.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.494
<i>Help!</i>

16:36.463 --> 16:39.566
Help me, please!

16:39.566 --> 16:41.201
Oh!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.576
I got it. I got it. I got it.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.113
If you hadn't have tried
to get out the bed...

16:53.113 --> 16:55.515
What you doing?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.016
Well, I'm tired
of being cooped up

16:57.016 --> 16:58.451
in the damn bed.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.220
<i>Why would you go
and do that, sissy?</i>

17:02.021 --> 17:04.057
I was gonna throw myself
out a window.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.058
I know, sissy.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.227
- It's a beautiful day.
- I know.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.661
And I just want to get out.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.498
I'm tired of withering away.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.334
I can't even wipe
my own ass anymore.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.405
Sissy, look at me.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.073
Look at me, baby.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.208
Be glad you got help,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.077
'cause it could be
so much worse.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.280
I'm not playing, Goldie.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.582
Every night, I pray to God

17:29.582 --> 17:31.418
that he don't wake me up
the next morning

17:31.418 --> 17:34.788
just so I don't have
to lay here in pain.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.056
Oh, baby.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
Please don't talk like that.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.827
Please, sissy, I told you.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.363
The doctors, they-they gonna
find a cure for it, baby.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.331
I just need you to hold on.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.367
Just hold on for me, sissy.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.568
<i>What the hell
did you see at Goldie's</i>

17:48.568 --> 17:49.702
<i>that made you want to jet out?</i>

17:49.702 --> 17:51.070
<i>I really don't know</i>

17:51.070 --> 17:52.238
<i>what the fuck I saw myself, Tee.</i>

17:54.441 --> 17:56.309
- What up, doe?
- What up?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.077
Ain't shit, man,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.646
Yo, what happened
to your other spot?

17:59.646 --> 18:00.747
Oh, I still got it.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.282
But that's
the stash crib, though.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.483
- Damn.
- He moved to heaven, huh?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.352
This is where me
and the fam stay.

18:06.352 --> 18:09.189
Y'all niggas trying to move in
or what?

18:09.189 --> 18:11.324
I mean, shit,
we got a upstairs, feel me?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.726
Actually, this payback
for fronting us.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.763
We even put
a little extra in there

18:16.763 --> 18:17.831
for holding us down.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.802
Ooh. All right.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.504
Look, we got
a new Colombian plug,

18:24.504 --> 18:26.272
and we been thinking
about planting a flag

18:26.272 --> 18:27.574
out here too.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.178
Man, come on, man.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.580
I can't have niggas
stepping on my toes, man.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.647
Nah.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.816
Nah, Ty, never do shit
like that.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.820
But look, Miami always
got shit coming up I-75.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.655
And Atlanta's the first hub,

18:42.655 --> 18:44.757
with freeways shooting
all across the country, man.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.860
Look, this where it's at.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.229
All we need is a hand
finding locals,

18:49.229 --> 18:51.197
stashes, dips, and fronts.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.370
A'ight, man. I guess, bro.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.506
Y'all is my niggas.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.377
And one-one more thing.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.179
Uh, we need
a real good exterminator

19:06.179 --> 19:07.780
'cause we got
some low-hanging fruit

19:07.780 --> 19:10.350
- that need to fall.
- A'ight.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.352
Yeah, we gotta be on point too.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.153
Can't leave no peels behind.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
Yeah, I got the man for that.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.490
<i>Ty.</i>

19:17.490 --> 19:19.659

19:31.704 --> 19:32.872
Yeah, nigga, we eating.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.228
Brother Flenory.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.265
Pastor Swift and I
are going to dinner.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.967
- What time you coming home?
- <i>I'm grown.</i>

20:01.200 --> 20:03.336
I don't have a curfew.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.337
Night-night.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.208
Dinner almost ready, Daddy.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.712
Thanks for cooking.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.419
If you and Ma get divorced,
who I'ma live with?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.588
What? Nico-Nicole,
that's not happening.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.656
Why stay married
if you so unhappy?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.725
We're not having
this conversation right now.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.427
That's the same thing Terry say

20:27.427 --> 20:30.396
whenever I try to talk to him
about anything substantial.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.632
Nicole, all you need
to know is,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.701
I'll always be there for you,
no matter what.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.671
I ain't never getting married
or having kids.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.274
Men suck.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.743
I mean, I just feel like
the Lord has forsaken me,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.378
you know?

20:45.378 --> 20:48.414
I'm-I'm-I'm making pennies
at Wendy's,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.350
and my husband is blowing
all our money

20:50.350 --> 20:53.453
on a hotel with some Jezebel.

20:53.453 --> 20:57.457
The temptation of flesh
is a powerful thing, sister,

20:57.457 --> 20:58.992
even for men of the word.

21:00.026 --> 21:03.029
I know that
thou shalt not murder,

21:03.262 --> 21:06.966
but if I ever find out
who this floozy is,

21:06.966 --> 21:09.435
I just might break
one of the commandments.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.604
Sister Flenory,
I always knew you had

21:11.604 --> 21:12.772
a wicked side to yourself.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.810
Lord, have mercy.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.480
Now, you know, God never said
there wouldn't be problems.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.282
But He did say
that He would walk with us

21:23.282 --> 21:24.384
through the valleys.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.019
We just have to know
and understand

21:26.019 --> 21:28.888
that He's in our favor
for all things.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.724
All the men in my life
have betrayed me

21:31.724 --> 21:33.559
and broken my heart.

21:33.559 --> 21:37.797
I mean, Demetrius, Terry,
and now Charles.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.668
Sister Lucille,
Pastor Swift got you covered.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.338
I don't need to be covered, Pastor.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.974
I just need to be counseled.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.411
Amen to that, sister.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.446
- Amen.
- Praise God.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.781
Hi, how you guys doing?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.816
- Leave this right here for you.
- Thank you, brother.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.951
You can take that thing back...

21:58.951 --> 22:00.620
and split it
right down the middle.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.321
- Yes, sir.
- Praise.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.852
You know how to make
quite the grand entrance.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.387
Well, Kevin's gone,

22:34.387 --> 22:36.889
so I thought you could use
some company.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.129
How'd it go with the bully?

22:44.764 --> 22:46.899
You know,
I took care of business.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.839

22:57.443 --> 22:58.644
Yeah.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.631
Ugh. Man, this shit bag
is the worst.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.567
Do it hurt?

23:21.567 --> 23:24.537
Yeah.

23:24.537 --> 23:28.040

23:43.856 --> 23:48.127
No, but it's been a minute

23:48.127 --> 23:51.564
Yeah. Yeah, it's been a minute.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.265
Fine. Tell her I called?

30:34.099 --> 30:35.868
Okay, I will.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.404
Zoe, I love you.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.417
"Mommy can't come to the phone
'cause I fucking killed her."

30:51.417 --> 30:53.852
Ah, fuck.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.155
<i>Shit. Ah, fuck.</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:03.896
And Ms. Mickie's transfer
to the other facility

31:03.896 --> 31:07.166

by Detective Von Bryant?

31:09.001 --> 31:11.003
Okay, um...

31:11.003 --> 31:13.172
can you please fax me
the paperwork

31:13.172 --> 31:15.474

31:15.474 --> 31:17.543
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.582

31:23.582 --> 31:26.585
Well, I didn't exactly want
to walk in here holding hands.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.220
No, no, no.
I'm not complaining.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.488

hospital bracelet

31:47.906 --> 31:49.475

31:49.475 --> 31:50.943
So I guess it wasn't a blanket

31:50.943 --> 31:52.444
you were snooping around for
last night.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.679
B-Mickie broke into your house

31:53.912 --> 31:55.447
because you had
his mother transferred

31:55.447 --> 31:57.616
to Herman Kiefer
medical facility,

31:57.616 --> 31:59.084
where she died.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.987
Yes, I transferred her, okay?

32:01.987 --> 32:03.622
Full disclosure,

32:03.622 --> 32:06.125
Ms. Mickie was already
at that shitty-ass facility.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.693
I moved her to a better one
to leverage her son

32:07.926 --> 32:09.295
into helping us.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.963
Now, when he ran off with Meech
and the two keys,

32:10.963 --> 32:12.531
I sent her ass back.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.233
Ain't my fault she dead.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.435
B-Mickie blames me,
so he broke into my house.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.638
Do you even know
what "full transparency" means?

32:21.040 --> 32:24.243
He broke into my house...

32:24.243 --> 32:26.545
and he locked my son
in the closet.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.250
So I didn't want you
compromised when I found him.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.520
Now, you can believe that,

32:34.520 --> 32:36.555
or you-you just might want
to do the right thing.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.524
So go to Garr's office
and make a statement.

32:38.524 --> 32:43.228
No, I-I'm gonna keep this
between us for now.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.999
But just know,
this is strike two, Bryant.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.967
Won't be another one.
I promise.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.171
From here on out,
I'ma tell you everything

32:52.171 --> 32:54.239
whether you want to hear it
or not.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.288
I never seen no shit like this.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.589
Nah.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.660
<i>Yeah!</i>

33:14.660 --> 33:16.128
<i>Detroit is in the building.</i>

33:16.128 --> 33:17.363
Yeah, boy.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.176
Fuck y'all want?

33:31.176 --> 33:33.445
Shit. I see you
working the crowd,

33:33.445 --> 33:35.280
making your move.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.548
I might got something better
for you, though.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.683
Where your crew at?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.551
I got boys from here
down to Texas.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.489
I'm Dice.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.556
Meech.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.392
This my boy B-Mickie
right here.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.529
Meet us at Magic City
later on tonight.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.597
Let's see what's cracking.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.532
This better not be
no bullshit, man.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.300
Man, what?

33:55.300 --> 33:56.535
Do I look like the type
of motherfucker

33:56.535 --> 33:58.237
to bullshit you?

33:58.237 --> 33:59.738
A'ight.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.144
We about to run these niggas
and blow the fuck up.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.515
Now you see why I demanded
you be here?

34:10.215 --> 34:11.550
Yeah.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.190
Here.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.058
I'm n--I'm not hungry, baby.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.593
Mama, you need
to eat something.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.063
Mama, you always taking care
of everybody.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.632
Let me take care of you, okay?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.838
I'm okay.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.740
You did good.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.649
Ms. Mabel,
my-my mom's right in here.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.188
Thanks for letting me
use the skillet.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.291
Girl, you know
you can borrow anything of mine

34:52.291 --> 34:53.859
anytime, whenever.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.160
I gotta get going.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.295
I got an appointment
I gotta get to.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.596
Come on. Sit down for a minute.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.498
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.268
Nicole, can you give us
a minute?

35:03.268 --> 35:05.404
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.277
What is it?
What-what's going on?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.746
Charles is having an affair.

35:20.853 --> 35:23.222
Lucille... my God.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.224
I knew in my gut
that something was wrong.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.860
I knew it. And he kept saying
that everything was good.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.662
But a woman always knows, right?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.431
Right.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.433
A woman's intuition's
hardly ever wrong.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.301
Look, I--

35:36.301 --> 35:38.604
I-I don't mean to dump
all my stuff on you.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.439
I just--

35:40.439 --> 35:43.141
I just know that you've been
through this before, and I--

35:43.141 --> 35:45.711
Oh, I-I think I got
some tissue in here.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.448
No.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.151
No.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.926
Lucille?

36:05.731 --> 36:07.165
E--

36:07.165 --> 36:10.168
E-Z Rest Motel.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.442
Hmm.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.351
I found a receipt
from this place

36:26.351 --> 36:28.353
in Charles' jacket.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.224
<i>You know, I been thinking
about what I would do</i>

36:32.224 --> 36:35.360
to the bitch who broke up
my happy home.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.796
And at first, I thought
I might go upside her head,

36:37.796 --> 36:38.830
you know what I mean?

36:40.365 --> 36:42.200
But now, like...

36:42.200 --> 36:43.335
I mean, it's, like,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.971
now that I've realized
it's you...

36:50.442 --> 36:51.677
Lucille...

36:51.677 --> 36:53.378
Don't you dare
open your mouth to me.

36:53.378 --> 36:57.382
Don't you dare
open your fucking mouth.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.654
All this time,

37:02.654 --> 37:05.557
I thought that Charles
was building a shed for you.

37:05.557 --> 37:10.362
But instead he was patching up
your damn dry-ass walls.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.964
I never meant to hurt you.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.901
That's why I broke it off
with Charles.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.971
That's why you broke it off
with Charles.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.306
Bitch, please.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.409
Stay away from me.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.246
And stay the hell away
from my damn family,

37:28.246 --> 37:30.449
or I swear to God,

37:30.449 --> 37:33.018
I will kick your ass

37:33.251 --> 37:35.621
all up and down this street.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.333
You are dead to me.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.268
<i>Now, get the hell
out of my house.</i>

38:01.680 --> 38:04.483
I hate you, Charles!
I hate you!

38:07.719 --> 38:09.054
Mom, it's okay.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.024
It's okay, Mama.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.495
Mabel?

38:17.696 --> 38:18.897
Really, Charles?

38:18.897 --> 38:21.400
I love you. I don't love her.

38:22.668 --> 38:26.338
Any shred of love

38:26.338 --> 38:28.674
I have left for you

38:28.674 --> 38:30.642

43:26.004 --> 43:28.606
I'll get back to you
with some potential listings?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.041
No doubt. Don't forget.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.081
I want to talk to you
about what you saw

43:36.081 --> 43:38.750
at my house the other day.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.885
That woman you saw,

43:40.885 --> 43:42.787
that's my baby sister Saundra.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.622
She's dying from AIDS.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.324
Damn.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.794
That's fucked up, Goldie.
I'm sorry to hear that shit.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.263
But you got somebody taking
care of her or something?

43:52.263 --> 43:54.132
Yeah, I have help.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.967
But that's my baby sister,

43:55.967 --> 43:58.336
which means
she's my responsibility.

43:58.336 --> 44:03.274
So every day I make sure
she's fed, clothed, and bathed.

44:04.175 --> 44:05.243
That's tough.

44:05.243 --> 44:07.212
You motherfucking right it is.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.247
But when you really care
about somebody,

44:09.247 --> 44:11.149
you go that extra mile
for them,

44:11.149 --> 44:12.717
just like they would for you.

44:12.717 --> 44:14.686
Mm-hmm.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.690
Yo, Remi,
check this shit out.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.860
The fuck that nigga doing here?

44:21.860 --> 44:23.028
I heard they setting up shop.

44:24.896 --> 44:26.331
We'll see about that.

44:38.943 --> 44:41.846
<i>What the fuck?</i>

44:41.846 --> 44:43.815
Shit!

44:43.815 --> 44:45.817
<i>Y'all didn't know
about this right here.</i>

44:45.817 --> 44:47.385
<i>- Hey, fam.</i>
- Who the fuck is that?

44:49.754 --> 44:50.955
<i>Y'all didn't know
about this.</i>

44:50.955 --> 44:52.190
<i>Take that.</i>

44:52.190 --> 44:53.725
Yeah, y'all want
the fucking eight?

44:53.725 --> 44:54.826
Y'all can't fuck
with the eight.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.227
Take that shit right there.

44:56.227 --> 44:58.063
Ay, let's go.
Ay, get in the fucking car.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.130
Ay!

45:06.037 --> 45:08.740
- Fuck.
- Tee! Tee!

45:10.008 --> 45:11.209
Yo, Meech, you straight?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.078
How the fuck that happen?

45:13.078 --> 45:14.946
Where the fuck
is Ty Washington at?

45:18.283 --> 45:20.251
<i>Oh, shit.
Meech, he's over here.</i>

45:20.251 --> 45:22.053
Oh, fuck!

45:23.154 --> 45:24.189
Fuck.

45:24.189 --> 45:25.824
Fuck, somebody get some help, man.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.058
Meech, we gotta fucking go.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.761
Meech, we gotta fucking
get the fuck out of here.

45:47.512 --> 45:50.281
<i>Ty, are you drunk
and forgot the elevator code?</i>

45:58.256 --> 45:59.924
Meech, where's my husband?

46:02.894 --> 46:05.029
There was a shooting
outside the club.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.871
I'm so sorry.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.205
Look, please forgive me.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.143
Get the fuck away from me.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.478
Ty, why-why you do this to me?

46:20.478 --> 46:22.514
I'ma make it right.

46:22.514 --> 46:23.781
I promise.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.453
I want whoever did this to pay.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.321
<i>Get the fuck out of here.</i>

46:39.297 --> 46:41.933
Yo, I can't believe this shit.

46:41.933 --> 46:44.335
Fuck this place.

46:44.335 --> 46:45.370
Thought this
where we supposed to be

46:45.370 --> 46:46.538
starting over.

46:47.472 --> 46:49.340
Could have did this shit
all in the D.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.477
Yeah, you can handle this shit.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.045
All this fighting
and shooting shit,

46:54.045 --> 46:55.413
man, that-that ain't me.

46:55.413 --> 46:58.016
Nigga, is that why your
bitch ass tried to set me up?

47:02.353 --> 47:03.922
Yeah, I seen you
talking to that hitter

47:03.922 --> 47:05.156
in the fucking parking lot, ho.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.192
What?

47:07.192 --> 47:08.426
Hey, yo, B, you tripping.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.929
Y'all niggas tried
to fucking kill me?

47:10.929 --> 47:13.264
Fuck you
and your lame-ass brother.

47:14.566 --> 47:16.034
That ain't happening, nigga,

47:16.034 --> 47:18.069
so you might as well
put that fucking gun down.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.173
B, don't make me repeat myself, man.

47:25.043 --> 47:26.911
Everything I did was for you.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.846
Pulling a strap
on my fucking brother?

47:28.846 --> 47:30.215
- That's for me?
- <i>Take this nigga</i>

47:30.215 --> 47:31.950
<i>out of his fucking misery, Meech.</i>

47:31.950 --> 47:33.618
Meech, shoot him.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.453
Meech, finish this bitch!

47:36.888 --> 47:39.023
I lied for you.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.925
I killed for you.

47:40.925 --> 47:43.595
<i>Meech, fucking do it!</i>

47:43.595 --> 47:45.530
And I'd still die
for your punk ass.

47:48.466 --> 47:49.867
Meech, if you don't shoot

47:49.867 --> 47:52.136
this snake-ass motherfucker
right now...

47:58.977 --> 48:00.111
No!

48:00.111 --> 48:01.879
No, no, no!

48:01.879 --> 48:03.114
No!

48:04.315 --> 48:06.284
I'm not losing
another fucking brother.

48:06.284 --> 48:08.553
<i>- I'm not!</i>
- Oh, my fuck.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.458
We started this shit together,
and we gonna end it that way.

48:14.492 --> 48:17.095
Meech, how the fuck
are we gonna do that, huh?

48:17.095 --> 48:18.529
By going directly
at the motherfucker

48:18.529 --> 48:20.331
trying to tear
our family apart.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.301
Bryant.

48:31.309 --> 48:32.944
Yo.

48:34.345 --> 48:36.347
Oh, shit, Markisha.

48:36.347 --> 48:37.515
Look, look, not-not right now.

48:37.515 --> 48:39.217
I'm gonna hit you back.
I promise, a'ight?

48:41.352 --> 48:42.987
Boom got arrested.

48:42.987 --> 48:44.555
Good. Fuck that nigga.

48:44.555 --> 48:47.292
No, no. Bryant got pictures
of me and Markisha doing it.

48:47.292 --> 48:49.560
If Boom see that shit,
he's gonna snap the fuck off!

48:59.237 --> 49:01.706
Photos worked.
Boom sang like a motherfucker.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.375
Said the Flenorys stole
K-9's Colombian connect.

49:04.375 --> 49:07.145
Oh, I am sure he has
an ax to grind.

49:07.145 --> 49:09.480
Look here, we gotta get around
this bureaucratic bullshit

49:09.480 --> 49:11.683
with the SAC Chambers
and the DEA

49:11.683 --> 49:14.585
so we can talk
to K-9's witnesses.

49:14.585 --> 49:16.321
And if we turn one of them,

49:16.321 --> 49:20.658
maybe we can get K-9 to give up
the Flenorys and the cartel.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.293
Then we back on top.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.062
- Yes!
- Ay.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.465

49:27.465 --> 49:29.434
