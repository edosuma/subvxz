A tornado warning remains in effect
for northeastern Johnson County

01:16.442 --> 01:19.880
in east central Kansas
and southwestern Jackson County

01:19.980 --> 01:23.783
in west central Missouri until 9:45 PM.

01:23.883 --> 01:27.421
National Weather Service Doppler radar
indicated this danger.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.922
Storm was located seven miles...

01:30.022 --> 01:31.792
No!

01:32.492 --> 01:34.963
God, help! God!

02:51.371 --> 02:53.273
So is your mom home?

02:53.373 --> 02:56.445
No, she's at her weekly
hair appointment.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.117
You want to fool around?

03:02.315 --> 03:05.352
- Do you ever think I'm gonna say yes?
- Patience is a virtue.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.320
Well, you got one.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.889
Seriously though, you want me
to wait till she gets home?

03:09.989 --> 03:13.327
No, I want you to wait
until I finish this cigarette.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.098
Remind me again why I hang out with you.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.037
'Cause you want to sleep with me.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.023
Oh, yeah.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.308
Thanks again for helping me
cut geometry today.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.178
Hey, I was leaving anyway.

03:31.278 --> 03:34.747
Besides, I'm going to be a porn star.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.484
The fuck do I need geometry for?

03:37.584 --> 03:39.553
Thank you.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.787
Hey, cheer up.
Your dad's coming home soon.

03:41.887 --> 03:44.658
Yeah, maybe he'll buy me
a GTO just like your daddy.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.963
Hey, I mowed a lot of yards
to get this car, okay?

03:49.895 --> 03:53.701
My dad's yard... a lot of times.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.808
All right, see you Saturday.

04:04.109 --> 04:07.415
- So it's a date then?
- Bye, Sean.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.937
I'm six-months sober as of tomorrow,

04:30.037 --> 04:31.505
as a matter of fact.

04:31.605 --> 04:36.009
My wife's coming back to me.
I get to see my kids again.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.646
I got you guys to all thank for that.
Thank you.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.718
Okay, I guess I'll go next.

04:44.818 --> 04:49.089
My name is Janet. I'm an alcoholic
and I've been sober for four months.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.192
Hi, Janet.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.930
Well, I should be happy right now
because my husband's coming home tonight.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.900
He's in the military. He's been fighting
overseas for the last year and a half.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.803
But to be totally honest,

05:03.903 --> 05:05.739
I don't feel happy.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.908
I feel... I feel really scared.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.545
Like I've been thinking about
all the things that he's seen over there

05:11.645 --> 05:13.981
and everything that he's lived through.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.150
And then he's gonna come home to...

05:17.750 --> 05:19.453
Me.

05:21.086 --> 05:24.570
I just thought that sobriety was going
to make things better. You know?

05:24.670 --> 05:29.096
I thought that if I could just stop drinking
that things would improve.

05:29.196 --> 05:32.465
But it hasn't been like that at all.
In fact, I feel like every day

05:32.565 --> 05:35.503
everything's getting worse
at home, you know?

05:36.737 --> 05:41.945
I don't know, it's...
I've just been really selfish.

05:43.075 --> 05:47.247
I guess that's why I'm here, you know?
I just... I want to do better.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.885
I want to... I want to be better.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.798
As these trained weather spotters
are continuing

05:53.898 --> 05:57.257
to feed us and give us the new information,
we'll make sure to give you the updates.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.428
Stay tuned. We will keep you advised
to this rapidly changing situation.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.330
Good afternoon.
The National Weather Service

06:03.430 --> 06:06.032
issued a tornado watch
earlier this morning

06:06.132 --> 06:09.703
and things are going
from showers to thunderstorms

06:09.803 --> 06:12.305
and getting a little more dangerous
across eastern Kansas.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.642
You can see over the last few hours,
starting to see those colors brighten up...

06:15.742 --> 06:19.213
a lot more red on the screen. That is
indicative of the storm strengthening.

06:19.313 --> 06:22.282
And really they're all converging
on eastern Kansas.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.151
Several warnings have been posted.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.884
At this point, it is only for hail
and high winds. But certainly,

06:27.984 --> 06:30.657
as the National Weather Service
has issued that tornado warning,

06:30.757 --> 06:35.429
there is the potential for some tornadic
activity as we progress throughout the day,

06:35.529 --> 06:38.764
as all of this travels across
the state and to the east.

06:38.864 --> 06:41.902
Areas west of I-35 look to be okay.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.340
But areas east of I-35...

06:57.550 --> 06:59.820
Girls, are you ready?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.903
I thought you quit smoking.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.274
Watch your face.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.482
...a serious situation to a slightly
more dangerous situation as...

08:01.848 --> 08:03.550
You ready?

08:03.650 --> 08:06.522
No, I'm running away.
That's why I've packed a bag.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.857
Why are we staying
in Kansas City tonight?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.726
Weather Channel says
there's going to be a storm.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.329
If your father's flight is delayed,
we might have to stay in a hotel.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.399
Then why don't we just stay here tonight
and go in the morning?

08:19.899 --> 08:23.644
Because I want us to be the first people
your dad sees, not some hotel desk clerk.

08:24.444 --> 08:26.274
Whatever.

08:27.874 --> 08:31.478
...county off to the east in Linn County,
the situation is turning a little worse.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.080
We're going from the thunderstorms now,
severe weather.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.582
Quite a bit of hail
reported down in Linn County

08:36.683 --> 08:39.352
and that is indicative
of these storms strengthening.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.087
Once you see the purple, the bright...

09:17.023 --> 09:20.181
...mobile homes and vehicles
should be abandoned for sturdier shelter.

09:20.281 --> 09:24.101
Otherwise go to an interior room
on the lowest level of your home

09:24.201 --> 09:25.399
or place of business.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.168
Make sure there are as many floors
and walls between you

09:28.268 --> 09:29.904
from the outside as possible.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.340
Repeating: A tornado warning
remains in effect...

09:33.440 --> 09:37.277
Please, I've lived in Kansas my whole life.
I've never once seen a tornado.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.646
You know you were born during a tornado.

09:40.604 --> 09:42.951
Yeah, I never heard that before.

09:43.051 --> 09:45.666
I can't say I remember much about it.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.322
Ditto.

09:48.823 --> 09:52.058
Hey, Mom? Can I change my name?

09:52.807 --> 09:54.394
Why would you want to do that?

09:55.368 --> 09:58.498
Sally is just so unprofessional.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.899
What do you mean?

09:59.999 --> 10:02.189
Well, can I at least go by Sarah?

10:02.289 --> 10:06.574
But your name's not Sarah, it's Sally.
Your father named you.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.109
Yeah, you were named
after Charlie Brown's sister.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.712
I was not, Jennifer!

10:12.712 --> 10:14.849
Hey, Alice, how's your book?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.918
It's fine.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.086
What's it about?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.123
A lot of things.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.992
Like?

10:25.692 --> 10:29.162
- It's a bunch of short stories.
- They any good?

10:29.938 --> 10:31.431
Haven't you read them?

10:32.612 --> 10:36.903
- Yes, but I want to know what you think.
- ...important weather information.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.039
- A tornado warning remains in effect...
- They're fine.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.819
...until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time
in Linn County in Kansas.

10:42.919 --> 10:45.284
The National Weather Service
in Topeka, Kansas,

10:45.384 --> 10:49.917
has issued a tornado warning for northeastern
Linn County near Blue Mound, Kansas...

10:50.017 --> 10:52.385
Mom, I have to pee.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.290
- National Weather Service Doppler radar...
- Peachy.

11:08.645 --> 11:09.904
...sturdier shelter.

11:10.004 --> 11:13.837
Otherwise, go to an interior room
on the lowest level of your home

11:13.937 --> 11:15.408
or place of business.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.612
Make sure there are as many walls
and floors betw...

11:18.980 --> 11:23.083
A tornado warning remains in effect
until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time

11:23.183 --> 11:26.488
in Linn County in Kansas.
The National Weather Serv...

11:29.922 --> 11:33.426
- Sally, I told you to go before we left.
- Hurry, gotta pee!

11:34.326 --> 11:35.995
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.365
You... you all right there, ma'am?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.633
Yeah. We're heading
to Kansas City tonight.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.769
Oh, I really don't think
that's a very good idea.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.640
There's a tornado ripping through Blue Mound
right now. It's headed this way.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.944
Oh, really?

11:48.044 --> 11:50.843
My husband's flight gets in
in a couple of hours.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.546
He's in the military.
He's coming home from overseas tonight.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.282
Well, I reckon he could wait
a few more hours

11:56.382 --> 11:59.653
as opposed to his wife
and daughters having an accident.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.388
Where would we go?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.993
I'm the wrong guy to ask.
I'm new here myself as of last week.

12:06.093 --> 12:10.765
But I'd be willing to bet any of these old
farmers would let you hole up in their cellar.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.988
Looks like the townspeople
are really taking this storm seriously.

12:18.088 --> 12:21.025
- You folks best get some shelter.
- Thanks.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.386
- Need any help closing up, Mrs. Shurman?
- No, thank you, Barney.

12:34.486 --> 12:37.293
Carr, get those people out of here.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.265
Now you all be damned careful out there.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.001
Thanks.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.641
I can't believe his name is Barney.

13:13.227 --> 13:17.479
A tornado warning remains in effect
until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time

13:17.579 --> 13:20.702
in Linn County. At 3:41 Central Day...

13:28.357 --> 13:30.310
What is that?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.312
A tornado siren.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.836
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

13:35.782 --> 13:38.707
- I'm sorry I didn't pee at the house.
- It's okay, sweetie.

13:38.807 --> 13:42.491
...other locations in the warning
include Anderson County...

13:47.460 --> 13:49.597
this storm is visible...

13:51.364 --> 13:55.004
straight-line wind gusts
of up to 60 miles per hour...

14:01.341 --> 14:05.014
or place of business.
Make sure there are as many floors...

14:08.381 --> 14:12.585
A tornado warning remains in effect
until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time...

14:22.595 --> 14:26.466
...Blue Mound, Kansas,
until 5:30 PM Central Daylight Time.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.668
At 4:50 PM Central Daylight Time...

14:28.768 --> 14:30.670
Mom, what's wrong?

14:41.883 --> 14:44.285
Everybody out of the car now!

14:50.190 --> 14:51.758
Don't look! Run, run!

15:10.393 --> 15:12.614
Hello?! Hello?!

15:14.814 --> 15:17.751
Help! Help!

15:25.770 --> 15:27.762
Mom?

15:50.050 --> 15:53.087
- Go, Mom, go! Go, go!
- Mom, hurry!

15:53.187 --> 15:55.156
Come on, come on!

15:55.256 --> 15:57.426
Go, go, go, go!

16:46.809 --> 16:48.876
I'm scared.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.182
I think we're safe. I think we're okay.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.713
Okay. Jen, are you okay?

17:32.013 --> 17:34.121
Yeah. Are you?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.189
Yeah.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.723
Everybody okay?

17:38.502 --> 17:40.261
I'm fine.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.831
Honey, you're always fine.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.338
Okay, come here.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.665
That was intense.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.502
Don't tell Dad I cried.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.477
Oh, honey.

18:24.577 --> 18:26.273
It's okay.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.515
Where are we?

18:34.615 --> 18:37.183
You think the storm's over?

18:37.983 --> 18:40.855
I think it's over enough
for us to leave.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.719
Damn it. There's a tree across the door.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.942
Shit.

19:01.442 --> 19:03.880
Jennifer, can you help?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.013
Oh, shit.

19:06.113 --> 19:09.313
Push, hard.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.991
Okay.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.428
Now what?

19:24.798 --> 19:26.634
Come on.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.764
Well, at least there's booze.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.334
Sorry.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.646
Let's see if somebody's home.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.521
Hey! Anybody up there?!

20:15.621 --> 20:18.121
Help! Help!

20:20.152 --> 20:21.921
- Hey!
- Hello?!

20:22.021 --> 20:24.057
Wait a minute.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.832
Hey, do you have your cellphone?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.769
Oh, duh.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.472
- You got a signal?
- Yeah, three bars.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.441
It's roaming though. Is that okay?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.345
Yeah, I think the extra charge is okay.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.417
Nothing.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.686
Nothing? Are you connected?

20:54.186 --> 20:57.693
Yeah, it connects.
It just connects to static.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.893
- Who are you trying to call?
- 911.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.796
Keep trying.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.569
If you push me up there,
I bet I could fit through.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.305
Oh, honey. Are you sure?

21:12.405 --> 21:15.841
No, but if you break out
the rest of the glass, I'll try.

21:17.033 --> 21:20.175
- Any luck, Jen?
- No.

21:20.581 --> 21:22.649
- Try texting someone.
- Yeah.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.584
Good idea.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.289
Wow, you're fast at that.

21:30.177 --> 21:31.492
Who are you texting?

21:31.592 --> 21:34.794
- His name's Sean.
- Yeah? Who's that?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.431
He's a guy that would travel
through a storm to get laid.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.200
Jen, please, the girls.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.544
Mom, please, I think we have
bigger fish to catch right now.

21:43.644 --> 21:45.372
- Damn!
- What is it?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.073
"Unable to send text message."

21:47.173 --> 21:49.276
Well, maybe it'll send
after the storm clears.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.915
Hey, will you send
a message to your dad?

21:57.050 --> 21:59.286
Okay, you ready to try this?

21:59.386 --> 22:01.754
I'm gonna knock
the rest of the glass out.

22:02.154 --> 22:07.020
"Dad, stuck in a cellar halfway to KC.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.042
Running late.

22:09.142 --> 22:12.932
Be there soon, Jen."

22:13.314 --> 22:17.471
Okay, "message pending."
Hopefully he'll get it soon.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.875
It's "fry," by the way.

22:20.975 --> 22:22.042
What?

22:22.542 --> 22:27.547
You just said we had bigger fish to catch,
but really it's "bigger fish to fry."

22:27.647 --> 22:29.849
Oh, thanks.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.816
Sure.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.886
You should talk more.

22:35.184 --> 22:36.223
Why?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.095
Because you're smart.

22:48.025 --> 22:51.107
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

22:58.163 --> 23:00.158
Is that...

23:06.461 --> 23:09.122
Do you think they heard us?

23:10.218 --> 23:12.461
I don't know how they couldn't have.

23:15.763 --> 23:17.833
What the hell?

23:21.434 --> 23:23.571
Why would they do that?

23:27.741 --> 23:29.744
I don't know.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.246
What was that?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.682
I'm willing to give
that window thing a try.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.506
Yeah. Come on.

23:55.301 --> 23:59.005
It's throbbing, it's throbbing inside!

24:00.043 --> 24:02.909
Go get something to wrap her arm!
Go now!

24:03.009 --> 24:04.710
Oh, my...

24:05.121 --> 24:08.216
Help me! Help me!

24:09.783 --> 24:11.820
What is all this shit?

24:17.624 --> 24:18.492
Rope.

24:20.260 --> 24:22.365
Mom, rope.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.101
Okay, let me see, let me look.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.082
This is soft.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.922
Come on.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.260
Here, here.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.937
No!

24:56.037 --> 24:58.306
Oh, baby. It's okay.

24:58.937 --> 25:02.068
Hold still, hold still. There.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.306
It's okay, sweetheart.

25:05.406 --> 25:08.512
I won't tell Daddy you cried, I promise.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.054
What did that to her?

25:21.821 --> 25:23.859
I don't know.

25:56.823 --> 26:00.395
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

26:01.361 --> 26:04.936
We just... we just need
to get her to a hospital right away.

26:05.036 --> 26:07.169
What happened to her?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.505
I don't know.

26:12.006 --> 26:15.709
I think maybe...
I think maybe she got bit by a dog.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.058
Mom

26:18.101 --> 26:20.213
did you see her arm?

26:20.313 --> 26:21.848
I know.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.530
What?

26:24.817 --> 26:26.319
It didn't look like a dog.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.890
Of course it was a dog.
What else would it have been?

26:29.490 --> 26:32.860
It just looked...
it just looked too clean...

26:32.960 --> 26:35.829
Jennifer, please.

26:36.329 --> 26:40.166
We need to... we need to get her
to a hospital right away.

26:40.466 --> 26:41.269
Mom.

26:52.145 --> 26:53.861
Come here.

26:55.048 --> 26:58.621
It's okay. Here, I want you
to stay with Sally.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.058
Come here.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.269
Here, I'll help.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.439
- Push.
- Oh, it's giving... okay.

27:19.539 --> 27:21.542
- Yes.
- Come on.

27:25.345 --> 27:27.109
The windows!

27:27.209 --> 27:29.218
Get through the windows!

27:39.293 --> 27:43.163
What the fuck is wrong
with you people? Let us out!

27:50.937 --> 27:53.207
Where the hell are we?

27:54.540 --> 27:56.177
What now?

27:59.046 --> 28:01.030
I don't know.

28:08.154 --> 28:13.459
"Sally is passed out.

28:14.157 --> 28:16.262
Someone is...

28:17.255 --> 28:20.733
keeping us here.

28:20.833 --> 28:24.229
Please help.

28:24.805 --> 28:30.113
We are in Wellsville."

28:35.515 --> 28:38.551
Hey, Jen, we need
to clean Sally's wound.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.221
- There's water.
- Where?

28:40.321 --> 28:44.327
- On the shelf in the corner.
- Okay, let's go get some.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.932
Another storm?

28:52.432 --> 28:56.272
Yeah. The radio said
it's going to storm all night.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.981
I'll go get that water.

29:26.508 --> 29:28.201
Come on.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.960
- Oh, my God.
- I wish your dad was here.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.600
- What is that smell?
- It's not water.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.354
- Definitely not water.
- What is it?

30:07.454 --> 30:10.810
- I think it's moonshine.
- What? Why?

30:11.954 --> 30:13.977
That's alcohol.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.551
I'm gonna use it to clean her wound
and it's gonna hurt like hell.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.721
Help me hold her down.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.396
Okay, sweetie. Here we go.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.599
Mom, stop it. You're hurting her.

30:37.699 --> 30:39.305
- Mom!
- It's okay, Alice.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.307
I'm sorry.

30:41.707 --> 30:44.211
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.

30:44.311 --> 30:46.348
I'm sorry.

30:52.118 --> 30:55.721
That's it. That's it. Stay still.

30:55.821 --> 30:58.225
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

30:58.325 --> 31:00.338
Promise.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.198
Jennifer?

31:05.301 --> 31:08.601
- Stay with me.
- I will, Sally.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.838
I won't let anything
happen to you, okay?

31:11.938 --> 31:14.340
I love you, Jennifer.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.443
I love you too, Sally.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.078
Just go to sleep now and rest, okay?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.416
We're gonna find a way
to get you out of here.

32:01.722 --> 32:03.827
You okay?

32:11.331 --> 32:14.235
There's got to be a way
out of this basement.

32:15.636 --> 32:19.639
- Maybe a door that leads upstairs?
- Is there a flashlight or something?

32:19.739 --> 32:21.809
I don't know. Maybe.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.787
Hey, Jen, do you have your lighter?

32:38.414 --> 32:39.959
No.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.329
It's in the car.

32:42.629 --> 32:46.366
Jennifer? Check Sally's pockets.

32:46.467 --> 32:49.402
- What?
- Promise not to be mad at Sally.

32:49.502 --> 32:51.105
Of course.

32:51.205 --> 32:54.740
When we were in the car,
she took your lighter out of your backpack.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.210
- Really?
- Yeah, she thought maybe if you didn't

32:57.310 --> 32:59.346
have your lighter, you wouldn't smoke.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.984
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, check her pockets.

33:08.221 --> 33:12.292
- I don't believe it.
- Sally saves the day.

33:13.462 --> 33:15.195
I promise, Sally,

33:15.495 --> 33:18.065
no more cigarettes, okay?

33:19.262 --> 33:20.568
Jen?

34:52.056 --> 34:54.194
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mrs. Shurman.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.728
Well, goodness sake,
get yourself out of this weather.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.898
- You'll catch your death.
- Thank you, ma'am.

34:58.998 --> 35:01.234
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
It's still warm.

35:01.334 --> 35:03.637
That'd be great. Thank you.

35:04.437 --> 35:07.740
- Are you baking something?
- Cookies before the power went off.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.575
- Want one?
- Oh, sure.

35:10.199 --> 35:12.745
Looks like the tornado went
right through.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.814
Lot of trees and power lines down.

35:14.914 --> 35:16.850
It'll be a hell of a clean-up effort
around here.

35:16.950 --> 35:19.853
Hell, it isn't even over.
Gonna storm all night.

35:19.953 --> 35:23.490
That's what I heard.
Gotta love this time of year.

35:24.022 --> 35:27.791
I never get used to it.
Makes people crazy in this town.

35:27.891 --> 35:29.577
Yeah, I noticed.

35:29.677 --> 35:33.333
I'm surprised you weren't holed up
in your cellar waiting for the storm to pass.

35:33.433 --> 35:36.403
Well, I prefer to wait it out up here.

35:36.503 --> 35:39.342
- And bake?
- It calms my nerves.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.144
Mrs. Shurman, real quick,
the reason I stopped by...

35:44.244 --> 35:47.147
- Yes?
- Well, there's a car out front.

35:47.247 --> 35:49.349
- Oh, really?
- Yes, ma'am.

35:49.449 --> 35:52.152
It belongs to a couple ladies
on the road up to Kansas City.

35:52.252 --> 35:53.987
And I was wondering if you'd seen them.

35:54.087 --> 35:58.695
You don't say?
Well, no, I sure haven't seen 'em.

36:00.294 --> 36:03.796
Mrs. Shurman, their car
is out in the ditch by the road.

36:05.588 --> 36:09.469
Perfect. Well, I sure hope
they're all okay.

36:11.106 --> 36:13.507
Are you sure they didn't stop by here?

36:13.607 --> 36:16.176
It just seems like this would be
the first place they would check.

36:16.276 --> 36:20.846
Well, not unless they got here before I did.
How many of them did you say there were?

36:20.946 --> 36:24.850
There were four of them actually. There was
a mother and three of her daughters.

36:24.950 --> 36:28.555
Oh, my. And you say they were
on their way to Kansas City?

36:28.655 --> 36:30.924
Yes, ma'am, to pick up
her husband at the airport.

36:31.024 --> 36:33.459
Hello, Barney.
Out checking the roads, I see.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.628
Hey, Sheriff!
I didn't know you were here.

36:35.728 --> 36:37.998
I just stopped by to help her
board up her cellar.

36:38.098 --> 36:41.401
I was going to ask about that. Looked like
you got it boarded up pretty good.

36:41.501 --> 36:45.339
Don't want a flood down there.
Lots of valuables in that old storm cellar.

36:45.439 --> 36:48.308
Yeah. Sure.

36:48.408 --> 36:52.045
Well, I'd better
get back out on the road.

36:52.145 --> 36:54.948
Horseshit. Stay inside here
and have another cup of coffee.

36:55.048 --> 36:58.819
You know, Albert, I would love to,
but those travelers really got me worried.

36:58.919 --> 37:01.955
They probably just went down
to Jacob's farm up the road.

37:02.564 --> 37:04.291
Yeah, I'll check there.

37:04.391 --> 37:07.993
You sure I can't talk you
into another cup of coffee?

37:08.093 --> 37:11.498
My, those lights seem
to have a mind of their own.

37:12.053 --> 37:14.134
I'm sure they'll have them
up and running soon enough.

37:14.234 --> 37:16.769
Yeah. Thank you for the coffee,
Mrs. Shurman.

37:16.869 --> 37:18.972
But I really should go check
on those ladies.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.908
You be careful out there now, Barney,

37:21.008 --> 37:24.510
and don't forget to say hello
to that beautiful new bride of yours.

37:24.610 --> 37:29.216
Will do. Now you folks get some candles lit.
No telling how long this will last.

37:29.516 --> 37:33.353
Oh, my! You forgot your cookies.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.993
- What are they?
- They're little tornadoes.

37:40.393 --> 37:43.597
Cute. Good night, folks.

37:55.842 --> 37:59.012
If something happens,
you're explaining it to his wife.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.214
Shouldn't have married him
in the first place,

38:01.314 --> 38:03.684
especially a month into storm season.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.890
Here, let me.

38:09.756 --> 38:11.324
Is this for Dad?

38:11.424 --> 38:16.200
Yeah. These storms are harder on him
than they used to be.

38:32.745 --> 38:35.949
Roger? Settle down.

38:50.230 --> 38:52.299
Is he getting a case of cabin fever?

38:52.399 --> 38:56.802
Just a little restless.
I'm surprised that you grew out of it.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.473
You used to be a real handful
this time of year.

38:59.573 --> 39:02.342
Storms really don't affect me
the way they used to.

39:02.442 --> 39:04.311
Teeth hurt a little... that's about it.

39:04.411 --> 39:09.216
Now you get that from my side of the family.
I wish your brothers were more that way.

39:09.316 --> 39:12.019
If this supercell they keep talking
about gets any closer,

39:12.119 --> 39:14.254
I might not be able to control myself.

39:14.354 --> 39:18.692
I'm gonna let Roger and the boys out
for a while tonight to enjoy the storm.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.817
Hershel's already out.

39:20.917 --> 39:24.764
Well, you know Hershel...
always was a free spirit.

39:24.864 --> 39:27.934
He took a bite out of one
of our visitors earlier.

39:28.034 --> 39:30.670
- And Tommy?
- In the cellar.

39:30.770 --> 39:34.507
The storm got to him early. I was hoping
that new muzzle will help him.

39:34.607 --> 39:38.611
You know they make those things for kids
and they never work right anyway.

39:38.711 --> 39:43.016
I had to chain him up and give him
some extra moonshine to calm him down.

39:43.116 --> 39:46.153
Probably won't stay that way
for long though.

39:50.857 --> 39:54.194
It's a shame about
that family down there.

39:54.294 --> 39:56.299
They seem real nice.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.854
Is there somebody out there?

40:54.354 --> 40:55.800
Hello?

40:55.900 --> 40:58.425
- Hello?!
- Hello?

40:58.825 --> 41:01.094
This is Deputy Carr from the Wellsville
Sheriff's Department.

41:01.194 --> 41:04.064
- Oh, thank God. Help us!
- We're trapped.

41:04.864 --> 41:07.369
Well, hold on,
I'll see if I can get you out.

41:20.590 --> 41:23.303
- What the hell are you doing down there?
- Get us out of here.

41:23.703 --> 41:26.353
- Are you okay?
- My daughter needs help.

41:26.453 --> 41:28.455
Hold on, I'll get the woman
who lives upstairs.

41:28.555 --> 41:29.875
No!

41:30.793 --> 41:33.829
- What?
- She's the one that locked us down here.

41:36.863 --> 41:38.266
All right.

41:38.366 --> 41:41.301
Let's get you the hell out of there.
Take my hand. I'll pull you out.

41:41.401 --> 41:43.404
Alice, you first.

42:16.678 --> 42:17.705
Hello?

42:19.996 --> 42:22.189
Hershel, calm down!

43:11.683 --> 43:13.562
Creepy.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.185
Oswald triplets.

44:31.504 --> 44:33.540
"Where are you?

44:33.640 --> 44:38.045
Sally is hurt bad.

44:38.145 --> 44:42.386
A cop tried to help..."

44:48.154 --> 44:49.756
"Help."

45:49.068 --> 45:51.326
"Struck by lightning"?

46:20.514 --> 46:23.984
Hey, I think I found a hallway
or something. I'm gonna check it out.

46:24.941 --> 46:28.065
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No.

46:28.165 --> 46:29.525
What?

46:30.690 --> 46:32.727
I said no.

46:34.092 --> 46:36.908
- Then let Alice go with you.
- I want you both to stay with Sally.

46:37.008 --> 46:40.000
No, that's stupid. You're not going
in a dark hallway by yourself.

46:40.871 --> 46:41.934
Jennifer.

46:42.034 --> 46:44.071
I can stay with Sally.
It's not that big a deal.

46:44.171 --> 46:47.176
- I don't want to leave you alone.
- I'll be fine.

46:48.608 --> 46:51.544
Is it just me or does that sound
like a terrible idea?

46:51.644 --> 46:54.147
Yeah. You're right.

46:55.381 --> 46:58.376
We all stay or we all go.

47:02.955 --> 47:04.959
Then we all go.

47:31.552 --> 47:34.155
How long is this tunnel?

47:34.455 --> 47:36.759
Must be 100 yards.

48:02.483 --> 48:04.453
What is it?

48:08.655 --> 48:11.092
I think it's a still.

48:14.494 --> 48:18.098
- Jen, careful with your lantern.
- Why?

48:18.198 --> 48:21.654
If that's a still
and this is a propane tank,

48:21.754 --> 48:23.972
it could explode.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.098
Alice, I need you to stay with Sally.

48:51.198 --> 48:54.275
We'll be right down the hallway,
so if you need something, just yell, okay?

48:54.375 --> 48:55.902
Okay.

48:56.289 --> 48:57.637
Mom?

48:58.988 --> 49:00.541
Yeah?

49:02.209 --> 49:04.851
What do I tell Sally when she wakes up?

49:06.512 --> 49:08.715
Tell her everything's going to be okay.

49:10.321 --> 49:12.501
Is that true?

49:14.254 --> 49:17.924
Alice, with every other beat
of my heart,

49:18.024 --> 49:20.427
I believe we're going to be okay.

49:20.527 --> 49:23.263
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:25.359 --> 50:26.960
It's not so bad.

50:27.060 --> 50:30.863
No, it's just... it's just awkward.

50:30.963 --> 50:32.804
- Really.
- Okay.

50:32.904 --> 50:35.202
Do you want to go forwards or backwards?

50:35.302 --> 50:38.374
I'll go backwards.
Can you get the lantern?

51:06.999 --> 51:08.469
Ready?

51:08.569 --> 51:10.870
- Wait, wait.
- What, what?

51:11.447 --> 51:15.142
- Change my grip.
- This could be a process.

51:15.242 --> 51:17.610
- Ready?
- Yeah.

51:17.910 --> 51:19.712
Okay, back up.

51:19.812 --> 51:22.161
- All right.
- Okay.

51:22.643 --> 51:25.020
- You go first.
- Okay.

53:20.634 --> 53:22.286
Mom?

53:30.377 --> 53:33.616
Going too fast. Okay.

53:34.847 --> 53:36.450
Yeah?

53:36.950 --> 53:38.720
You okay?

53:41.221 --> 53:44.458
- Can you see now?
- That's good.

53:56.987 --> 53:58.730
Here comes the door.

53:58.830 --> 54:02.442
- How's the ramp on your side?
- It's good.

54:02.542 --> 54:04.610
Are you okay?

54:04.910 --> 54:06.847
All right, it's good.

54:06.947 --> 54:09.644
- Don't go too fast.
- I'm sorry.

54:10.149 --> 54:13.621
Wait, do you hear something?

54:14.787 --> 54:16.543
What is that?

54:17.257 --> 54:20.326
- I don't know.
- Keep going.

54:20.926 --> 54:22.619
That's it.

54:23.236 --> 54:25.249
All right.

54:29.369 --> 54:32.339
Mom, where's Alice?

54:32.439 --> 54:34.174
Alice?

54:34.274 --> 54:35.943
Alice?

54:36.043 --> 54:38.049
Put the still there.

54:38.978 --> 54:40.213
Alice?

54:40.313 --> 54:43.017
- Alice? Alice?
- Where is she?

54:44.417 --> 54:46.286
Where is she?

54:46.486 --> 54:47.988
Alice?

54:51.791 --> 54:53.926
What the hell is this?

54:54.326 --> 54:56.129
Alice?

55:40.974 --> 55:42.776
Oh, God, no!

55:49.482 --> 55:51.938
Oh, no!

55:52.885 --> 55:56.624
I'm sorry. Oh, my baby.

55:57.491 --> 55:59.827
Oh, God, oh.

55:59.927 --> 56:02.631
Oh, God, no!

56:27.887 --> 56:29.484
Mom?

56:31.358 --> 56:33.662
We have to get out of here.

56:36.262 --> 56:38.599
Mom, we can't give up.

56:42.435 --> 56:44.471
Jennifer...

56:44.771 --> 56:47.007
we're gonna die here.

56:47.407 --> 56:49.409
No, we're not.

56:50.009 --> 56:53.148
You still have daughters
who need you right now.

57:04.458 --> 57:06.277
I won't give up.

57:31.451 --> 57:33.553
Jennifer?

57:33.853 --> 57:35.889
What was that thing?

57:35.989 --> 57:38.961
I don't know.
But next time we'll be ready for it.

57:44.664 --> 57:46.367
Mom?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.436
Mom?

57:49.536 --> 57:51.639
Give me a minute.

57:56.509 --> 57:58.446
Never mind.

58:15.995 --> 58:19.300
- Mom, are you okay?
- No, Jennifer.

58:20.100 --> 58:23.372
I'm not fine.

58:27.841 --> 58:30.446
Mom, I need you to pull it together.

58:35.081 --> 58:37.618
Pull it together?
Your little sister just...

58:37.718 --> 58:41.354
Mom, I'm thinking about right now, okay?

58:41.454 --> 58:44.224
And right now we need to put
that contraption in front of the door

58:44.324 --> 58:46.595
and blow it off the hinges.

58:50.763 --> 58:52.833
And I need your help.

59:29.569 --> 59:31.439
Do you hear that?

59:52.258 --> 59:53.760
Mom!

01:00:31.498 --> 01:00:33.624
- Jennifer?
- Mom!

01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:40.241
Oh, God.

01:00:41.474 --> 01:00:43.377
Can you stand?

01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:47.174
You gotta get Sally out of here.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.517
We're all getting out of here.

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:03.430
Look at how happy Dad is.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:06.466
I haven't seen him
with this much energy in years.

01:01:06.566 --> 01:01:11.073
- Should we let Roger out?
- Give your dad a little while.

01:01:16.008 --> 01:01:20.413
Looks like that second storm is coming
after all. It's gonna be strong.

01:01:20.513 --> 01:01:26.154
Then I guess that explains all their energy.
They're gonna sleep for a month after this.

01:01:50.943 --> 01:01:52.912
Where am I?

01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:55.615
- It's okay, Sally.
- Jennifer, it hurts.

01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:57.550
I know, Sally.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.620
- Where's Mom?
- Right here, sweetie.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.987
Mom, are you okay?

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:07.742
- Sally, Mom got hurt real bad.
- I'm fine.

01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:11.698
- Where's Alice?
- Sally, we have to get out of here.

01:02:11.798 --> 01:02:13.266
- What's going on?
- We need to leave.

01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:15.602
I need you to cover yourself, okay?

01:02:15.702 --> 01:02:19.276
I... what do you mean? Where's Alice?

01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:23.878
Alice is gone.

01:02:25.945 --> 01:02:28.815
She... she's dead?

01:02:28.915 --> 01:02:32.487
Yes. Now, Sally, we have
to get out of here. Can you walk?

01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:36.157
Mom, you're bleeding.

01:02:36.257 --> 01:02:39.360
It's okay, honey.
I need you to be strong,

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:42.096
and we're gonna get out of here, okay?

01:02:42.196 --> 01:02:45.765
We're gonna get Dad too, okay? Come on.

01:02:46.565 --> 01:02:50.003
I need you to get behind me
and cover your heads.

01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:51.800
What are you going to do?

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.775
I'm gonna throw this,
you're gonna hide, okay?

01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:57.510
Can you run?

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:59.345
- I don't think...
- If I help you?

01:02:59.445 --> 01:03:00.747
- I'll try.
- Okay.

01:04:16.423 --> 01:04:18.149
Mom!

01:04:22.027 --> 01:04:23.796
Mom!

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:25.765
Mom?

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.303
Mom, please wake up.

01:04:29.603 --> 01:04:31.610
Mommy, please!

01:04:34.076 --> 01:04:35.844
Thank you, Mommy.

01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:48.789
Are you ready? Okay.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.851
Are you okay?

01:05:05.495 --> 01:05:06.507
Behind you!

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:25.326
Shit!

01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:30.664
Jennifer!

01:06:05.832 --> 01:06:08.067
Why didn't you just listen
to the weatherman for once?

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:11.404
We're not the only ones with trees down.
It's gonna be fine.

01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:13.773
I told you to cut down
that branch last year.

01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:17.578
- What if it would have hit the nursery?
- It wasn't going to hit the nursery.

01:06:21.714 --> 01:06:23.751
Honey, come here.

01:06:26.953 --> 01:06:27.855
What the...

01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:35.462
- You girls okay?
- She's cut up pretty badly.

01:06:35.562 --> 01:06:38.433
Let's get you guys inside. Come on.

01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.775
All right, let's take a look.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.217
Oh, sweetie.

01:06:57.082 --> 01:07:00.686
We gotta get her out of here
or call the cops...

01:07:00.954 --> 01:07:03.193
It's gonna be all right.

01:07:03.989 --> 01:07:07.368
- It does look pretty infected though.
- You poor thing.

01:07:07.468 --> 01:07:09.651
You don't understand.
There were things out there that...

01:07:09.751 --> 01:07:13.167
Just calm down.
I'm gonna go call for help.

01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:18.739
Let's get you some new bandages.
Bathroom's this way. Come on.

01:07:31.284 --> 01:07:33.986
Poor kid's teething in the other room.

01:07:34.086 --> 01:07:36.857
There's disinfectant
and bandages in the top drawer.

01:07:36.957 --> 01:07:39.827
- Just take whatever you need.
- Thanks.

01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:47.902
This baby's just kicking up a storm.

01:07:48.002 --> 01:07:51.139
I hate when this happens. Excuse me.

01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:07.740
- Jennifer! Jennifer!
- Sally? Sally?

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.117
Sally, no!

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:13.020
Get away from me!
Please get away from me!

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.822
Jennifer, help me!
Jennifer, please help me!

01:09:17.221 --> 01:09:21.095
- Sally! Sally!
- Jennifer! Jennifer!

01:09:24.564 --> 01:09:26.434
Jennifer!

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.963
I'm so sorry, Sally.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.258
There's no need to run, sweetie.
We just want to have a word with you.

01:10:24.858 --> 01:10:26.395
Get the fuck back.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:32.199
You're lucky that the storm affects
each one of us a bit differently.

01:10:32.299 --> 01:10:34.795
Otherwise you'd be dead already.

01:10:49.282 --> 01:10:51.119
Shit.

01:11:27.086 --> 01:11:30.596
This is where we part company, dear.

01:12:33.153 --> 01:12:34.901
Shit!

01:13:39.119 --> 01:13:42.556
No dead. But there's still
a lot of us unaccounted for...

01:13:42.656 --> 01:13:44.909
mostly youngsters.

01:13:45.892 --> 01:13:49.495
But you know how these storms go. Some
of them just don't know how to recover yet.

01:13:49.595 --> 01:13:52.233
They'll find their way home
this afternoon.

01:13:53.866 --> 01:13:57.471
- Any signs of the girl?
- No.

01:13:58.171 --> 01:14:00.543
You think she's still alive?

01:14:07.547 --> 01:14:10.352
No, she's gone with the storm.

01:14:11.784 --> 01:14:15.489
With this much damage,
there'll be news teams heading this way.

01:14:15.889 --> 01:14:17.659
We'll see.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.132
I'm sorry about your mother.

01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:34.865
More storms coming in a few hours.

01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:37.478
Could be worse than last night.
