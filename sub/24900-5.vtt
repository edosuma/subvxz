As superheroes,

01:00.474 --> 01:04.373
what do you girls feel
defines a villain?

01:04.409 --> 01:06.894
Oh, that's easy.
They're selfish.

01:06.928 --> 01:08.275
Oh, definitely.

01:08.309 --> 01:09.414
And greedy.

01:09.448 --> 01:10.553
Preach, sister!

01:10.587 --> 01:12.555
And they do bad stuff
to others.
