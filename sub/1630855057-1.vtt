WEBVTT

01:29.045 --> 01:30.699
- What am I supposed to do now?

01:30.829 --> 01:32.396
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Cutler.

01:32.527 --> 01:33.832
I know these are hard to see.

01:33.963 --> 01:37.967
- 20 years of marriage.
20. Thrown away for what?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.969
A cheap fling?

01:40.100 --> 01:44.408
I have leave him now, I mean...
I have to leave him.

01:44.539 --> 01:48.020
- Now, Mrs. Cutler, that's...
That's really not for us to say.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.197
- Well, what do
your other clients do?

01:51.110 --> 01:53.591
- Some people leave,
some people stay.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.463
Everybody reacts
differently.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.551
The main thing right now,
Mrs. Cutler,

01:57.682 --> 01:59.119
is that you have
all the information,

01:59.249 --> 02:00.990
which means you have
all the power.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.255
- Power? Do I look like
I have power?

02:05.386 --> 02:08.127
- Just because you're hurt
doesn't mean you're powerless.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.434
You're armed with
everything you need

02:10.565 --> 02:12.001
to make an informed decision.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.655
So you hold all the cards.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.400
- I just knew that he was
messing around behind my back.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.446
I knew it. But now
that I know for sure...

02:25.406 --> 02:27.843
I just feel so worthless.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.412
- You are not worthless.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.938
Hey, you were smart enough
to come in here

02:36.067 --> 02:38.636
and ask a question you maybe
didn't want the answer to.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.161
But you did it.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.555
And that takes guts.
And strength.

02:44.686 --> 02:48.255
And yes, being betrayed
by somebody you love,

02:48.385 --> 02:52.084
somebody you thought you knew;
that hurts.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.174
But that is not on you.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.088
That is on him.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.047
It is always on them.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.963
Men cheat;

03:01.093 --> 03:03.966
they break promises,
but now, you get to decide,

03:04.096 --> 03:06.925
is this a man that you can learn
to trust again?

03:07.056 --> 03:10.842
Or do you move on,
knowing what you know now?

03:10.973 --> 03:13.105
You stand in that power

03:13.236 --> 03:15.804
and you make that decision
for yourself.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.984
- You're right.
I've done nothing wrong.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.116
- No, you didn't.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.075
Never take the fall for
someone else's wrongdoing.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.383
- I have a lot to think about.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.690
- Thank you.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.215
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.347
- You've been helpful.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.402
- 10 bucks says she stays.
- Nah.

03:48.531 --> 03:50.230
She's gonna bleed him dry.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.539
- Lucy Thompson?
- Who's asking?

03:55.670 --> 04:00.022
- My name is Clive Cassel.
You came highly recommended.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.676
- Yes, Mr. Cassel. I believe

04:01.806 --> 04:03.417
I spoke to your assistant.
- That's right.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.549
- What can I do for you,
Mr. Cassel?

04:05.680 --> 04:08.117
- Please, call me Clive.
- What can I do for you, Clive?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.424
- I think my wife
is having an affair

04:10.554 --> 04:12.774
and I would need
your help proving it.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.429
It's not always
the man who cheats...

04:16.298 --> 04:17.866
- Of course.

04:17.995 --> 04:20.129
Uh, please, have a seat.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.306
August, aren't you
going to join us?

04:23.437 --> 04:24.960
- No, I've got an interview
to get to.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.135
You can bring me up
to speed later.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.267
- Sure.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.139
Can I get you a coffee?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.445
- Please.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.928
Adriana was
my interior designer.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.672
We met shortly after
I sold my first start-up.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.893
We've been together
just under eight years now.

04:45.023 --> 04:48.462
The first six, happy.
The rest...

04:50.246 --> 04:52.422
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

04:52.553 --> 04:56.426
It was the closest I'd ever come
to love at first sight.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.950
And now, she's got me wondering

04:59.081 --> 05:00.561
whether she ever
loved me at all.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.911
- A lot of people wonder that

05:03.041 --> 05:04.695
when they suspect
their spouse is cheating.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.957
- Right.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.962
- So, what initially made you
question her fidelity?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.704
- Oh, the usual stuff, I guess.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.793
Gradually, throughout
the years,

05:15.924 --> 05:17.404
I could sense her pulling away.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.406
I know I can take
some of the blame for that,

05:19.536 --> 05:22.713
I travel a lot for work
and she's always busy too.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.063
It's hard to find time
to be together.

05:25.194 --> 05:30.417
But when we do make
the time, it's... different.

05:30.547 --> 05:33.071
- Different how?

05:33.202 --> 05:34.943
- Well, for starters,
we stopped having sex.

05:36.074 --> 05:40.775
And she became difficult
to get a hold of,

05:40.905 --> 05:42.777
screening my calls,

05:42.907 --> 05:47.042
she started having
private conversations
behind closed doors.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.870
She never used to do that.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.351
She's an interior designer.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.831
What could possibly be
so confidential?

05:54.876 --> 05:57.139
Do you need me to continue?

05:57.269 --> 06:00.708
- No. From the sounds of it,
you're completely justified

06:00.838 --> 06:03.232
in feeling the way you do.
- Oh, thanks.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.495
It's nice to know
I'm not losing my mind.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.411
- You're not. In my experience,

06:08.542 --> 06:10.848
it's always best
to trust your instincts.

06:12.633 --> 06:16.637
- Well, it'll be
a relief to finally get
to the bottom of this.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.856
Whatever the truth is.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.728
- I understand.

06:20.858 --> 06:24.906
- So, how does this work?
Do I have to sign something?

06:25.036 --> 06:27.778
- Uh, do you have
any questions for me?

06:27.909 --> 06:29.780
Am I the first investigator
you've met with?

06:29.911 --> 06:32.957
- No. I met with
Rudy Davis last week.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.657
- Oh, Rudy. How'd that go?
- He's a hack.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.094
- Wasn't gonna say.
- I've done my research.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.270
I've explored a few
other options and...

06:42.053 --> 06:43.403
I want you.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.014
- What makes you so sure?

06:47.755 --> 06:50.279
- Let's just say
I'm trusting my instincts.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.674
- I'll have August
send over a contract

06:53.804 --> 06:55.066
and we'll go from there.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.113
- Wonderful. Thank you.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.415
- Hey, Cami.
- Happy almost birthday.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.286
- Do you have to remind me?

07:41.417 --> 07:42.897
- What would you do without me?

07:43.027 --> 07:45.159
- Not have a birthday party,
for starters.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.641
- Oh, don't be such
a party pooper!

07:47.771 --> 07:50.382
This is your 35th! We have
to do something special.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.037
I've kind of invited someone
I want you to meet.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.866
- You know I don't do setups.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.870
- Look, sweetie, I know you
don't trust anyone.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.960
I get it. You're exposed
to a lot of bad guys

08:03.091 --> 08:04.788
doing what you do every day.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.704
But, not everybody cheats.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.837
I mean, just look
at Charles and I.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.363
If you just let someone in,
just for once,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
maybe you can be
as happy as we are.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.936
How bad could it be?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.633
If I'm wrong,
I will leave you alone.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.461
No more setups.

08:28.725 --> 08:32.033
Hello? You there?

08:32.163 --> 08:34.209
- Alright, fine.
You can invite him.

08:34.338 --> 08:35.602
- Yes!

08:35.732 --> 08:37.038
- But if he turns out

08:37.168 --> 08:38.779
to be another dud,
you leave me alone?

08:38.909 --> 08:39.866
- Scout's honor.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.479
- I'll see you Friday.
- Love you!

08:43.610 --> 08:45.046
- Love you too.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.145
- Who you texting?
- Just Lucy.

11:51.275 --> 11:54.714
You ever meet Adriana or
Clive Cassel at the CATC ball?

11:54.844 --> 11:57.238
- Not that I know of, why?

11:57.368 --> 11:59.022
- Must be for a case
or something.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.678
- Uh, I got to get to work.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.335
Hey.

12:08.075 --> 12:11.078
I love you.
- Love you, too.

12:24.874 --> 12:29.183
- Hey! Uh, just my usual.
And uh,

12:29.313 --> 12:30.706
a round for my friends.

12:32.229 --> 12:35.363
I can't believe it,
she's wearing a dress.

12:35.493 --> 12:39.715
- Nice. I should set you up
on blind dates more often.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.066
- No, you shouldn't.
This was so much work.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.851
- Can you grab...?
- Yeah.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.552
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday, Lucy.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.296
You guys!

12:56.906 --> 13:00.388
I love them!
These will come in handy!

13:00.518 --> 13:02.694
Thank you both so much.

13:02.825 --> 13:07.047
So, tell me about Mr. Wonderful.
- What? Remi?

13:07.177 --> 13:09.745
Well, he's... He's...

13:09.876 --> 13:11.094
He's wonderful.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.186
Unless you're already
spoken for, that is.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.319
I'm pretty sure he's kind of
the monogamous type.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.931
- Oh, that is August,
my new associate,

13:22.062 --> 13:23.541
wishing me a happy birthday.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.239
He has been a lifesaver,

13:25.369 --> 13:27.154
I honestly don't know how I did
anything without him.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.507
Thank you.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.032
Well, cheers.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.643
To best friends.
Thank you guys for doing this.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.863
- We love you, Lucy.
- Cheers.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.518
- So, seriously,
tell me about this guy.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.302
What's wrong with him?
Why is he single?

13:45.433 --> 13:47.870
- Well, I occasionally snore,

13:48.001 --> 13:51.091
casually drink and I may have
a slight shoe fetish.

13:51.221 --> 13:54.442
- Uh, well, those look like
regular old shoes to me.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.575
- I like her.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.360
Remi.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.797
- Lucy.
- Nice to meet you.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.581
- Well, there it is,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.714
Love at first slight.

14:07.672 --> 14:12.025
Hey, I'm just really glad
the two of you got off
on the right foot!

14:12.155 --> 14:13.940
- Ugh!
- Wow.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.724
- Yeah.
- What?

14:16.681 --> 14:18.640
- Well, what do you think?

14:20.207 --> 14:23.863
He's nice, right? He likes you,
he asked me for your number.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.648
- I will admit,
I had a good time.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.650
- So, you gonna see him again?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.218
Charles can 100 % vouch for him.

14:31.348 --> 14:35.396
- Cami, I don't know.
- Take a chance!

14:35.526 --> 14:39.052
Life is full of unknowns,
but risks like this are
worth taking!

14:40.357 --> 14:42.794
Lucy, how many times
do I have to tell you

14:42.925 --> 14:46.015
they are not all bad guys?
- Okay! Fine!

14:46.146 --> 14:48.670
If you stop badgering me,
then I'll go out with him again.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.324
- Now wasn't that easy?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.762
Your chariot awaits.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.850
- Ladies...

15:03.250 --> 15:04.555
- Thank you.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.617
- Sorry, boss.
Didn't mean to scare you.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.142
- That lunch?
- Yeah.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.492
- Then, I won't fire you.
- Thanks.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.625
If you need anything else,
I'll be at the office.

15:30.755 --> 15:31.931
- Thank you!

15:42.811 --> 15:44.639
Where are you going?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.673
And who might you be?

17:04.806 --> 17:06.199
Surprise!

17:23.128 --> 17:24.913
- Thank you for meeting me.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.654
- Of course.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.221
- What are you drinking?

17:29.091 --> 17:31.398
- Uh, I really shouldn't.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.530
I'm charging you
by the hour, remember?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.881
Uh... Manhattan.

17:38.579 --> 17:39.928
- On me.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.408
- Thanks.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.279
So, uh...

17:44.715 --> 17:47.414
Sorry to say I've been tailing
Adriana for a week

17:47.544 --> 17:49.285
and I have nothing
to show for it.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.982
- Oh?

17:51.113 --> 17:54.029
- There's no suspicious
activity.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.596
Her phone log is clean,

17:55.726 --> 17:57.250
she goes to and from work
most days,

17:57.380 --> 18:00.514
consultations,
a homecoming party...

18:01.515 --> 18:02.820
I don't know what to tell you.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.692
I don't think
you need to keep me on.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.783
- Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.786
- Thanks.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.181
- But, I want you to stay on.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.835
- You would?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.620
- She's up to something.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.057
You've only been
on the case for a week.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.190
I'm sure if you stay on longer,
something will come up.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.235
Call it intuition.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.412
- You really don't trust her.

18:29.543 --> 18:33.808
- Well, a wise woman once
told me to follow my instincts.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.556
Typical.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.084
- Someone you know?

18:49.215 --> 18:50.868
- No.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.783
Turns out,
I don't know him at all.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.917
- And what does that mean?

18:56.047 --> 18:57.353
- You don't want to know.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.789
- Try me.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.447
- Okay. Um...
We met last week.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.666
Thought he was interested.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.411
- Well, for what it's worth,
he's obviously an idiot.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.242
- Thank you.
But I'm the idiot.

19:16.372 --> 19:21.029
I let my friend convince me
to let my guard down

19:21.160 --> 19:23.901
despite my better judgement,
I did.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.207
Serves me right.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.340
- No one deserves
to be deceived.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.517
- I know that better
than anyone.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.214
Look at what I do.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.998
- Right.

19:34.129 --> 19:38.655
So, what got you
into all of this?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.701
Private investigating?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.314
- Well...

19:45.445 --> 19:47.925
My dad left when I was little.

19:48.056 --> 19:51.494
Ran off with his secretary,
believe it or not.

19:52.626 --> 19:56.543
Blindsided my mom,
left her with nothing.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.850
Just seemed like the best way
to make sure

19:59.981 --> 20:01.200
it didn't happen
to someone else.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.464
- So, it's personal.
- Yeah.

20:05.856 --> 20:08.294
That and I always thought
I had killer instincts.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.991
Until now, that is.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.907
- Oh hey, don't let this guy
make you doubt yourself.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.649
We all misjudge people
once in a while.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.565
- I should have known better.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.393
This is why I don't date.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.092
- Ever?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.660
- I always saw trust
as a weakness.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.230
- That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

20:32.840 --> 20:34.885
- This coming from the guy
who asked me to follow his wife?

20:39.586 --> 20:41.109
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.112
- No, don't apologize,
you're right.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.420
- Well, I should get going.
Thank you for the drink.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.900
- Stay.
- I really shouldn't.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.946
- Don't make me eat alone.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.740
- So, you don't eat alone.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.438
What's that about?

21:05.568 --> 21:07.178
- Oh I didn't say I don't.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.268
I just prefer not to.

21:12.096 --> 21:15.448
What? Is that so hard
to believe?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.319
- I don't know,
I just had you down

21:17.450 --> 21:18.668
as the independent type of guy.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.280
- Oh no, you've got me
all wrong.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.933
Total codependent.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.110
- Really?
- I'm kidding.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.985
Though, I'm starting to think
no one is as independent as you.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.335
- How do you figure?

21:33.466 --> 21:35.598
- You live alone,
you don't date ever,

21:35.729 --> 21:37.383
you see trust as a weakness.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.950
- Okay. Point taken.

21:40.081 --> 21:43.171
- But come on, there must be
someone you can trust.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.567
- Cami.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.396
We've been best friends
since college.

21:50.526 --> 21:55.444
She's been by my side
despite my... intensity.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.100
Through thick and thin,
no matter what.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.843
For years it was me and Cami
against the world.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.498
- Was?

22:07.064 --> 22:09.371
- She married her husband
Charles a few years back.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.199
- Charles?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.333
And how do we feel
about Charles?

22:16.291 --> 22:19.816
- At first, I had my doubts,
as you can imagine.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.819
But he's actually become
a really good friend.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.082
And they're great together.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.171
They're like
the perfect couple.

22:27.302 --> 22:30.349
If there's anyone who could
convince me that...

22:32.568 --> 22:35.441
Never mind.
- What?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.530
- No, it's nothing.
It's stupid.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.315
- Come on, say it.
- No. Really.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.361
- You know I won't let up.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.840
- You are shockingly persistent.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.583
I was just gonna say,

22:47.714 --> 22:49.672
if there's anybody who could
make me believe in true love,

22:49.803 --> 22:51.239
it would be them.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.547
That was even sappier
out loud.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.725
- I think it's nice.

23:03.643 --> 23:08.082
I'm starting to think
you're more of a romantic
than you let on.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.399
You're sure it was him?

23:20.529 --> 23:23.663
- Positive.
- Damn, Luce. I'm sorry.

23:23.793 --> 23:27.710
I totally misjudged him.
- Yeah well, I did too.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.583
I'm just glad it ended before
it even started, you know?

23:30.713 --> 23:34.021
- What were you doing
at The Waverley, anyway?

23:34.151 --> 23:36.066
- I was meeting a client.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.852
- At The Waverley? Fancy.

23:38.982 --> 23:42.508
- Yeah, well, he insisted.
Actually, he um...

23:43.770 --> 23:45.946
He made me feel better
about the whole thing.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.470
We had dinner, talked.
It was nice.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.993
- Having dinner with a client?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.647
I never would've thought
I'd see the day.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.301
- Like I said, he insisted.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.998
- Hey, Luce.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.174
Cami mentioned a Cassel
the other day,

23:57.305 --> 23:58.785
is that the client?

23:59.699 --> 24:01.309
- His name is Clive.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.443
I don't know, there's like
something about him.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.532
I just feel like
I can talk to him.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.229
- Are you sure
this is a good idea, Lucy?

24:08.359 --> 24:09.796
Fraternizing with a client?

24:09.926 --> 24:11.580
He's obviously going
through a lot.

24:11.711 --> 24:14.583
Maybe you should just move
away from this one.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.846
- What are you talking about?
A job's a job!

24:16.977 --> 24:18.457
They just had dinner.
What's the big deal?

24:18.587 --> 24:20.850
- He's a married man, Cami.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.983
What do you even know
about this guy anyway?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.637
- She's a professional, babe.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.986
She's done her due diligence.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.378
Right, Luce?

24:27.509 --> 24:29.163
- Obviously.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.687
Look, I gotta get ready work.
I'll talk to you guys later.

24:31.818 --> 24:32.819
Bye.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.264
- What?

24:43.394 --> 24:44.874
- I really don't think
it's a good idea.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.615
- She knows what she's doing.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.183
- You're right.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.359
Okay.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.754
Love you.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.843
Oh, hey, I've got
that meeting tonight.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.497
So I'm gonna
be home late. Okay?

24:58.627 --> 25:00.847
- Yup. Love you too.
- Bye.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.198
- Have a good day!

25:49.678 --> 25:51.114
- Good work everyone.
Keep it up.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.508
Let's go! Let's go!
Train hard, let's go! Again!

25:53.639 --> 25:55.292
Alright, let's go, come on.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.077
Hard, let's go.
Come on, train hard.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.992
Cross, jab, cross, jab. Come on!

25:59.122 --> 26:00.515
Cross, jab, cross, jab.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.649
One, two, three, four!
Good, keep going.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.215
Come on, come on!

26:05.346 --> 26:07.261
Hey, Clive, you made it.
Come in.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.220
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all good.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.092
Alright, let's go.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.660
Come on, guys, let's go!

26:14.790 --> 26:16.966
Come on, guys.
Let's keep training!

26:17.097 --> 26:18.402
Let's go, let's go, come on!

26:18.533 --> 26:20.143
Train hard, let's go,
come on!

26:20.274 --> 26:21.449
Ten more, come on!

26:25.279 --> 26:26.846
Next combination.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.373
Let's go, Lucy! Come on, hard!
Come on! Don't slack off.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.941
Come on! 10 more! 10 more!

26:35.071 --> 26:36.464
Let's go!

26:36.595 --> 26:39.598
Okay, listen up,
time to pair up.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.035
Try and team up with someone you
haven't worked with yet, okay?

26:42.165 --> 26:43.602
Let's go, find somebody.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.516
Let's go, come on,
don't waste time.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.822
- Hey!

26:48.215 --> 26:50.957
So what do you say?
Partners?

26:52.349 --> 26:53.742
- Sure.
- Alright.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.528
- Jab, cross!
Again, two more times.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.879
Jab, cross.
Let's go, let's go!

27:00.009 --> 27:01.707
Okay, next combo, Lucy,
next combo.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.318
Right cross, left hook,
right cross.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.928
Don't give up, come on,
everybody!

27:06.059 --> 27:07.495
Come on, I see you slacking
back there, come on!

27:08.975 --> 27:11.455
Get your ass in gear,
let's go, come on, guys!

27:11.586 --> 27:13.501
There it is, yeah, you got it.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.812
- That's quite
the right hook you've got.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.292
- It comes in handy.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.990
You'd be surprised the number
of unsavory characters

27:24.120 --> 27:25.208
I've had to use it on.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.297
- I don't doubt it.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.648
- I've never seen you here
before. New hobby?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.650
- That obvious, huh?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.304
- You held your own.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.917
- Yeah, well, I'm thinking
about investing in the studio.

27:38.047 --> 27:40.180
So, figured I'd come
check it out.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.182
- And?

27:43.966 --> 27:46.360
- I can definitely see
the appeal.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.669
- Well, I should get going.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.758
I don't want my employer
to think I'm slacking off.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.194
- Yeah. Of course.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.676
Nice running into you,
Lucy Thompson.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.250
- Have a good night.
Thank you.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.621
- I know you're following me.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.103
I don't want to hear it,

29:17.233 --> 29:19.409
I know Clive put you up to this.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.456
You're not the first person he's
hired to chase me around town.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.327
He's not who you think he is.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.416
I'd be careful if I were you.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.269
- Dean Calvet plus one, bar.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.645
Clive. Hi.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.777
- Hi. I hope I'm not
calling too early.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.823
- No, not at all.
I'm actually at the office.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.999
- Wow. The reviews online
weren't kidding

32:38.130 --> 32:40.045
when they said
you were dedicated.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.134
I was going to see
if you wanted a coffee.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.701
- Yeah, actually,
that would be great.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.487
Um, there's been
a development with your wife,

32:47.617 --> 32:49.184
I'm just not sure
what it is yet.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.882
Do you know a Dean Calvet?

32:52.013 --> 32:55.147
- Uh, no. Why?

32:55.277 --> 32:56.539
- She had dinner with him
last night.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.019
I was hoping maybe
you knew who he was.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.674
- No. I've never heard
that name before.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.676
- I've got a couple photos.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.069
Maybe you could come by
and identify him?

33:04.199 --> 33:06.201
- Absolutely.
I'll be by shortly

33:06.332 --> 33:07.376
with your coffee
and take a look.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.856
- Great.

33:11.163 --> 33:14.209
They didn't so much
as kiss goodbye.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.125
So they're definitely not
romantically involved,

33:17.256 --> 33:20.302
but she did hand him an envelope
right before he got in the Uber.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.913
So you're right,
there's something going on,

33:23.044 --> 33:24.437
I just don't know
what it is yet.

33:24.567 --> 33:27.701
- Well, I don't
recognize him, but...

33:28.963 --> 33:31.096
What happened after
the envelope?

33:31.226 --> 33:34.360
- He just got in the Uber
and then I followed her home.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.668
- What?
So, you were at my place?

33:39.278 --> 33:40.322
- Yeah.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.194
Why?

33:43.978 --> 33:45.327
- Did you see me?

33:46.937 --> 33:47.895
- Yeah.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.378
She came in, went straight
to the kitchen,

33:52.508 --> 33:55.207
kissed you.
That's when I left.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.557
- Lucy...

33:59.994 --> 34:01.343
Nothing happened.

34:03.128 --> 34:06.044
- It doesn't matter.
She's your wife.

34:07.306 --> 34:09.221
- We're not in love anymore.

34:12.614 --> 34:14.878
- Then why do you care
if she's having an affair?

34:15.009 --> 34:16.750
Why don't you just leave her?

34:17.533 --> 34:19.187
- It's not that simple.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.495
I need to prove
she's cheating

34:22.625 --> 34:25.759
or else she'll fight me
for everything in the divorce.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.543
- So, it's about the money.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.722
- It was...

34:35.725 --> 34:37.945
But it's not anymore.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.428
- What's it about?

34:51.001 --> 34:54.440
- Lucy... it's about you.

34:59.227 --> 35:00.750
- I think you should go.

35:03.318 --> 35:04.624
- Yeah.

35:05.407 --> 35:06.930
Right. I'm sorry.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.802
- No. I'm sorry.
- It's just...

35:11.979 --> 35:15.113
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.767
- Clive, I...

35:19.334 --> 35:20.466
- What?

35:23.556 --> 35:25.297
- I can't cross this line.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.131
- I understand.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.134
I'll go.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.837
- I'll let you know if I find
anything else about your wife.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.012
- Yeah.

37:20.107 --> 37:21.064
- Lucy!

37:24.459 --> 37:25.765
Sorry I'm late.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.333
The line-up at the coffee bar
was nuts.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.160
Damn hipsters!

37:30.291 --> 37:32.728
I'm in here. Come on in.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.863
- Oh, Mr. Cassel,
good morning.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.214
I'd have brought you a coffee
if I knew you were here.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.998
- Clive brought coffee.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.565
I got some pictures
of this guy last night

37:43.696 --> 37:45.872
and Clive was kind enough
to drop by last minute.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.788
- Thanks, August.
I really do need to get going.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.964
- Thanks for coming by.
- Not a problem.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.450
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.061
Dean Calvet. Got these photos

38:01.191 --> 38:03.063
of him with Adriana Cassel
last night.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.283
I need you to help me figure out
how they know each other.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.634
- Okay. I'll do some digging.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.218
Ah!

39:26.973 --> 39:29.236
- Okay, you ready?
Come on, let's go! Jab!

39:30.237 --> 39:32.979
Double jab! Good, okay.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.808
Ready? Let's go, fast!
Right hand

39:35.938 --> 39:37.505
Duck! Here we go again!

39:43.859 --> 39:44.904
Ah!

39:46.384 --> 39:49.256
- I'm so sorry!
- What's wrong with you?!

39:49.387 --> 39:51.171
- I was distracted, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

39:51.301 --> 39:53.303
- Yeah, it's okay.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.958
Alright, everyone,
let's switch partners.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.264
Come on, let's go!

40:10.408 --> 40:11.757
Charles?

40:11.887 --> 40:13.280
Charles!

40:19.286 --> 40:20.548
- Luce! Hey.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.377
What are you doing here?

40:23.508 --> 40:25.597
- I just finished boxing.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.642
Why are you
on this side of town?

40:27.773 --> 40:29.775
- Oh, I'm just meeting
a potential client.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.734
- Here?
- Yeah. He insisted.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.867
He owns a couple
of these places.

40:34.997 --> 40:38.392
- Ah, an underground gambling
ring leader.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.176
Say no more.
- Yeah.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.135
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

40:43.702 --> 40:45.181
- Well, I won't keep you.
- Nice seeing you.

40:45.312 --> 40:46.444
Hey, Luce?

40:49.011 --> 40:52.101
Would you just mind not telling
Cami about this?

40:52.885 --> 40:54.452
You know how she worries.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.805
- Sure. Okay.
- Great.

42:20.276 --> 42:21.539
- Hey!

42:31.636 --> 42:35.161
- I just don't think
this is something John Cutler
would be capable of.

42:35.291 --> 42:37.903
- Yeah, me neither,
just doesn't fit the profile.

42:39.382 --> 42:43.561
- Well, then, it leaves us
with Dimitri Alexander.

42:45.606 --> 42:46.781
What's his story?

42:46.912 --> 42:49.567
- Last I checked,
Dimitri was in jail.

42:49.697 --> 42:50.959
- Okay. What happened?

42:51.438 --> 42:53.048
- I put him there.

42:53.179 --> 42:55.529
This was years ago when
I was doing surveillance

42:55.660 --> 42:57.183
for the police department.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.967
They had me tailing him
for weeks to gather evidence

42:59.098 --> 43:00.926
against him
in a drug-related incident.

43:01.056 --> 43:03.102
Turns out he wasn't just
into drugs.

43:04.146 --> 43:05.495
He had a thing
for beating his wife.

43:07.019 --> 43:10.109
I testified against him.
Put him away for a long time.

43:10.239 --> 43:12.285
Well, interesting.

43:13.416 --> 43:14.592
- What?

43:16.855 --> 43:18.944
- Well, it says here
Dimitri Alexander was let out
on parole last week.

43:19.945 --> 43:22.774
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.299
Wait a minute, where you going?
- I'm going to El Caballito.

43:26.429 --> 43:27.953
That's the bar he used to run

43:28.083 --> 43:29.302
his business out of.
- Hold on.

43:29.432 --> 43:30.695
- I'm not leaving this
to the cops.

43:30.825 --> 43:32.174
They couldn't put him away
without me last time.

43:32.305 --> 43:33.567
I'm not trusting them
to do it now.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.308
- Okay, Lucy, sit down. Please.

43:40.835 --> 43:43.882
Listen, just leave this
to me, alright?

43:44.012 --> 43:46.798
Take the day. I will go
through the files,

43:46.928 --> 43:48.538
I'll come up
with some questions.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.845
It's not gonna get us anywhere
if you go over there

43:50.976 --> 43:52.717
and get hurt by a violent
wife-beater

43:52.847 --> 43:54.457
who has a personal vendetta
against you.

43:56.024 --> 43:56.938
- You're right.

43:58.766 --> 44:01.551
- Now, go home, take the day.
You've been through a lot.

44:01.682 --> 44:03.728
- I can't go home.

44:03.858 --> 44:06.382
I've got to get back
to the Cassel case.

44:06.513 --> 44:08.602
Adriana's supposed
to be going out of town
with her sister tonight

44:08.733 --> 44:10.125
and I still don't know
who that guy was

44:10.256 --> 44:11.561
she went out for dinner
with the other night.

44:11.692 --> 44:12.780
- Lucy, breathe.

44:13.955 --> 44:15.653
I'm sure Clive will
understand

44:15.783 --> 44:17.829
if you take one day
for yourself.

47:12.481 --> 47:13.613
- Who's there?

47:13.743 --> 47:14.962
- It's Clive.

47:22.535 --> 47:23.536
- Hi.

47:24.493 --> 47:25.886
What are you doing here?

47:26.669 --> 47:29.194
- I just needed to see you.

47:31.761 --> 47:33.024
You alright?

47:35.200 --> 47:36.375
Hey...

47:44.687 --> 47:46.820
- I don't know what to do.

47:46.951 --> 47:49.214
I don't even feel safe
in my own home anymore.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.042
- It's completely
understandable.

47:51.172 --> 47:53.261
Someone breaks into
your house

47:53.392 --> 47:55.089
and with this Dimitri guy
out there...

47:55.220 --> 47:57.048
- Yeah.

47:57.178 --> 47:58.701
And then,
there's the nightmares.

47:58.832 --> 48:01.139
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

48:01.269 --> 48:03.576
- You're not losing your mind,
Lucy.

48:03.706 --> 48:06.013
Hey. Look at me.

48:07.101 --> 48:08.842
You're being personally
targeted.

48:08.973 --> 48:11.889
This is stressful and scary

48:12.019 --> 48:14.195
and this guy is obviously
deranged.

48:14.326 --> 48:16.415
Something like this would be
enough to rattle anyone.

48:19.287 --> 48:20.898
- So what do I do?

48:23.248 --> 48:25.728
- You could get out of town
for a few days.

48:25.859 --> 48:29.254
At least until August gets some
information out of this guy.

48:30.081 --> 48:33.084
- So what, just... up and leave?

48:34.041 --> 48:36.696
What about your wife?
What about the case?

48:36.826 --> 48:39.177
- You know, Adriana is
out of town with her sister

48:39.307 --> 48:40.395
for the next few days.

48:40.830 --> 48:42.397
- Or so she says.

48:43.181 --> 48:45.183
This could be our smoking gun.

48:45.313 --> 48:47.402
Don't you want to know
where she's really going?

48:47.533 --> 48:50.753
- She's going to Vale to see
her sister and her nieces.

48:50.884 --> 48:53.669
She goes every year, she'll be
posting about it all weekend.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.106
- Yeah, but...

48:56.107 --> 48:58.936
- You can take a break from
the case, Lucy.

49:00.111 --> 49:01.460
Seriously.

49:05.290 --> 49:06.769
It can wait.

49:09.642 --> 49:12.471
- Well...
Where would we even go?

49:17.389 --> 49:18.477
- Trust me.

49:28.226 --> 49:30.489
- August, hi.

49:30.619 --> 49:33.144
- I'm just calling to let
you know that Dimitri no longer

49:33.274 --> 49:34.623
runs his business
out of El Caballito.

49:35.755 --> 49:38.149
- Damn.
- No, no, it's okay.

49:38.279 --> 49:41.021
I've managed to find
where his new front is.

49:41.152 --> 49:42.936
It's a nightclub called
The Blue Grotto.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.285
I'm gonna pay him a visit
later tonight.

49:44.416 --> 49:45.939
- Nice work.

49:46.070 --> 49:47.549
I should come with you.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.160
- No, no.
It's better if I go alone.

49:49.290 --> 49:50.900
He doesn't know who I am

49:51.031 --> 49:52.728
and he won't know I'm connected
to you in any way.

49:52.859 --> 49:56.428
- Right.
Okay, well, be careful.

49:56.558 --> 49:57.733
- Yeah. Of course.

49:57.864 --> 49:59.474
- I, uh... I should let you know

49:59.605 --> 50:01.302
I'm gonna be out of town
for the next few days.

50:01.433 --> 50:02.956
- Oh. That sounds great.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.740
That should be good for you.

50:04.871 --> 50:06.786
- Yeah. At least until you get
something out of Dimitri.

50:06.916 --> 50:09.528
- Yeah. Couldn't agree more.
Where you heading?

50:09.658 --> 50:12.270
- A cabin in Meadowbrooke.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.880
- Nice. You're renting?

50:14.011 --> 50:17.275
- No, it's... it's a friend's.

50:17.405 --> 50:19.059
- Nice friend.

50:20.452 --> 50:22.193
I've heard there's some pretty
fancy cottages out that way.

50:22.323 --> 50:24.543
- Yeah. For sure.

50:25.718 --> 50:27.372
- You okay?

50:27.894 --> 50:29.765
- All things considered?

50:29.896 --> 50:32.116
Yeah. I'm good.

50:32.246 --> 50:34.161
- Alright.
Enjoy the countryside. And...

50:34.292 --> 50:35.771
I'll give you a call after
I talk to Dimitri.

50:35.902 --> 50:37.860
- Sounds good.

50:37.991 --> 50:39.688
Everything okay?

50:39.819 --> 50:42.474
- Yeah. I don't know...

50:42.604 --> 50:44.215
I just feel like he knows
I'm hiding something.

50:44.345 --> 50:46.130
- Well, I wouldn't worry
about him.

50:46.260 --> 50:47.653
You're the boss.

50:47.783 --> 50:50.177
If he finds out, he'll just
have to deal with it.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.241
- This is amazing.

51:11.372 --> 51:12.765
- Thanks.

51:14.245 --> 51:16.247
It's been in my family
for generations.

51:17.987 --> 51:20.077
Oh, it's one of
my favorite places.

51:22.992 --> 51:25.169
- Thank you for
bringing me here.

51:55.590 --> 51:57.026
- Name?
- Hey. No.

51:57.157 --> 51:59.899
I'm not on your list.
I'm here to see Dimitri.

52:00.029 --> 52:02.206
- No one gets in
if they're not on the list.

52:02.336 --> 52:03.729
- I'm one of
his business partners.

52:03.859 --> 52:05.209
He's expecting me.

52:05.339 --> 52:06.688
- Yeah, well, Dimitri
is not here right now.

52:06.819 --> 52:09.169
- Oh yeah?

52:09.300 --> 52:12.129
Why don't you let me go inside
and have a look for myself?

52:12.259 --> 52:15.828
- Like I said, no one gets in if
they're not on the list.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.266
- Right.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.233
Dimitri.

52:29.363 --> 52:30.843
I need to talk to you.

52:33.062 --> 52:34.107
Damn!

53:10.274 --> 53:11.710
- Hmm.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.921
So, what do you think?

53:49.051 --> 53:51.184
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:51.315 --> 53:53.534
You're obviously
still a little on edge.

53:53.665 --> 53:56.885
Well, why don't I put
on a fire

53:57.016 --> 53:58.800
and you can pour us some wine?

53:58.931 --> 54:00.759
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

54:00.889 --> 54:02.239
I'm sorry.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.690
- What?

54:18.820 --> 54:20.692
I'm just looking at you.

54:24.565 --> 54:27.786
Oh, my God. That smile
is gonna be the death of me.

54:33.182 --> 54:34.793
- What is it about you?

54:36.577 --> 54:37.404
- What do you mean?

54:40.538 --> 54:42.757
- I never let my guard down.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.805
But around you...

54:49.068 --> 54:50.983
I know I just met you.

54:54.334 --> 54:56.293
I don't know,
it just feels like...

54:58.991 --> 55:00.775
- Like an instinct?

55:02.821 --> 55:04.779
- Yeah.

55:52.392 --> 55:53.654
- Come on, Dimitri.

55:53.785 --> 55:55.700
I know you're down there.

56:01.096 --> 56:02.881
- What do you want, man?

56:04.230 --> 56:05.623
- I just wanna talk to you.

56:05.753 --> 56:07.364
- What do you wanna know?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.368
- Where were you the night
of April 27th?

56:17.025 --> 56:18.462
Let me phrase it another way.

56:18.592 --> 56:20.333
Did you break into
Lucy Thompson's house?

56:20.464 --> 56:21.726
- Yeah.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.249
- Why?

56:24.206 --> 56:25.773
- I was paid by some guy
to mess with her.

56:25.904 --> 56:28.646
That bitch ruined my life,
seemed like a win-win.

56:28.776 --> 56:31.213
- Someone paid you to break
into her house?

56:31.344 --> 56:35.827
- Yeah, some guy named Clive,
gave me 10 grand,

56:35.957 --> 56:38.003
said it was time for the hunter
to become the hunted

56:38.133 --> 56:40.571
or some crap like that.
- Clive...

56:47.142 --> 56:48.709
- Hey!

56:48.840 --> 56:50.102
Who are you?

56:51.190 --> 56:52.757
Who the hell are you?

56:57.196 --> 56:58.850
- Lucy, pick up the phone.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.591
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson...

57:00.721 --> 57:02.375
- Lucy, pick up the phone!

57:02.506 --> 57:04.246
- Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back...

57:31.665 --> 57:32.927
- Meadowbrooke?

57:42.589 --> 57:44.461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

57:51.119 --> 57:52.991
- How are you feeling?

57:54.079 --> 57:55.602
- I'm feeling a lot better.

57:56.777 --> 57:58.475
- This place has that effect.

57:59.650 --> 58:01.608
- I think you have that effect.

58:01.739 --> 58:03.828
Do I?

58:12.837 --> 58:14.142
Coffee?

58:14.926 --> 58:16.841
Thanks.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.017
- I'll be right back.

58:44.912 --> 58:45.870
- Come on.

58:47.001 --> 58:48.437
- There you are.
- Hey.

58:48.568 --> 58:50.222
Ooh.

58:50.352 --> 58:52.529
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
Everything okay down here?

58:52.659 --> 58:54.356
- No! August left me a voicemail

58:54.487 --> 58:56.271
and I can't check it
because I have no signal.

58:56.402 --> 58:58.491
- Yeah, the reception here
is pretty awful.

58:58.622 --> 59:00.014
- I don't know what to do.

59:00.145 --> 59:02.626
This could be important.
It could be about Dimitri.

59:03.714 --> 59:06.020
I shouldn't have come here.
- Oh, hey, hey.

59:06.151 --> 59:07.892
It's a good thing you came.

59:08.022 --> 59:09.937
You needed this. Remember?

59:10.068 --> 59:11.722
- I need to get back
to the city.

59:14.072 --> 59:16.378
- I know where we can get
a signal. Come on.

59:19.599 --> 59:21.035
Try now.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.865
- Two bars.

59:25.692 --> 59:27.259
That should do it.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.132
You don't have to wait for me
if you don't want to.

59:31.263 --> 59:32.264
- No, I'll wait.

59:32.394 --> 59:33.918
I want to know what he said.

59:51.849 --> 59:53.111
What did he say?

59:55.287 --> 59:57.594
Lucy, hey! Hey!

59:59.073 --> 1:00:01.728
Lucy, what did he say? Lucy!

1:00:01.859 --> 1:00:03.600
Just talk to me!
- It was you!

1:00:03.730 --> 1:00:06.646
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

1:00:06.777 --> 1:00:09.170
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:19.572
- Oh, my God.

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:21.618
No!

1:00:24.533 --> 1:00:25.839
Oh, my God!

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:29.800
- Lucy!

1:00:30.757 --> 1:00:32.977
What did you do?

1:00:39.984 --> 1:00:41.333
Come on.

1:00:57.131 --> 1:00:58.350
- Thanks.

1:01:03.355 --> 1:01:04.922
- What's going on?

1:01:05.052 --> 1:01:06.793
- Self-defense.
They're not gonna hold me.

1:01:06.924 --> 1:01:09.013
- Great, then come on.
Let's get out of here.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.196
So... you were sleeping
with the client.

1:01:20.589 --> 1:01:22.853
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to make sense of all this.

1:01:22.983 --> 1:01:25.029
- It was stupid, I know.

1:01:26.813 --> 1:01:28.380
I can't talk about it
right now.

1:01:28.510 --> 1:01:30.034
- Okay.

1:01:32.601 --> 1:01:35.866
- Thank you... for warning me.

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:40.000
Who knows what would have
happened if I'd stayed there
with him.

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:42.350
- Hey.

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:44.701
We're in this together.

1:02:19.605 --> 1:02:22.303
- Lucy, where the hell were you?

1:02:22.434 --> 1:02:24.044
I tried calling.

1:02:24.175 --> 1:02:25.872
- Thank you for being there.

1:02:26.003 --> 1:02:28.266
- Of course. Get some rest.

1:02:29.702 --> 1:02:32.618
- Uh, August,
this is my best friend Cami.

1:02:33.184 --> 1:02:34.838
- It's nice to finally meet you!

1:02:34.968 --> 1:02:36.491
- Pleasure to meet you.

1:02:36.622 --> 1:02:38.450
I should go.

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:40.191
Call me if you need anything.

1:02:40.321 --> 1:02:41.627
- I will.

1:02:44.151 --> 1:02:46.110
- What's going on?

1:02:47.894 --> 1:02:50.114
- Clive's dead.

1:02:50.244 --> 1:02:52.029
- What?!

1:02:52.159 --> 1:02:53.682
- It was an accident.

1:02:53.813 --> 1:02:55.380
I was defending myself.

1:02:55.510 --> 1:02:57.425
He wasn't who I thought
he was at all.

1:02:58.339 --> 1:03:00.211
I was at his cabin.

1:03:00.341 --> 1:03:02.604
He was the one behind
the break-in.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.564
He was after me the whole time.

1:03:05.694 --> 1:03:07.218
- Oh, honey.

1:03:07.348 --> 1:03:08.654
Let's get you inside.

1:03:09.350 --> 1:03:10.787
Come on.

1:03:15.879 --> 1:03:17.663
So, what happens next?

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:21.319
- I don't know.

1:03:24.539 --> 1:03:26.280
But right now, we drink.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:57.355
Hey.

1:03:58.617 --> 1:04:00.314
What's going on? You okay?

1:04:01.663 --> 1:04:03.840
- I'm fine.

1:04:03.970 --> 1:04:06.059
I'm sorry. You don't need
to hear this right now.

1:04:06.190 --> 1:04:08.235
- Cami, something
is clearly bothering you.

1:04:08.366 --> 1:04:10.063
Talk to me.

1:04:10.194 --> 1:04:12.239
- You've just been
through so much.

1:04:12.370 --> 1:04:15.721
Now is not the time.
- I'm here for you, always.

1:04:16.591 --> 1:04:17.592
What's going on?

1:04:17.723 --> 1:04:19.377
- It's Charles.

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:21.988
- What about him?

1:04:23.511 --> 1:04:25.165
- I just...

1:04:29.343 --> 1:04:31.041
I think I might need
to hire you.

1:04:33.521 --> 1:04:36.394
- You think Charles
is cheating?

1:04:36.524 --> 1:04:38.744
Where is this coming from?

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.660
- He's been acting differently.

1:04:41.790 --> 1:04:44.837
Going out to see clients, coming
home at five in the morning.

1:04:44.968 --> 1:04:47.187
I never know where he is.

1:04:47.318 --> 1:04:50.060
- His job has always been
demanding, though, right?

1:04:51.322 --> 1:04:52.758
- Not like this.

1:04:54.412 --> 1:04:57.763
These past few weeks,
he's been totally withdrawn.

1:04:59.808 --> 1:05:03.856
He can't even look at me,
let alone touch me.

1:05:03.987 --> 1:05:06.380
The other day, he came home
blackout drunk

1:05:06.511 --> 1:05:08.687
with a busted lip.

1:05:08.817 --> 1:05:11.255
I think he might be
gambling now. I just...

1:05:11.995 --> 1:05:14.432
I don't know what to believe.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.566
- When was that?

1:05:18.697 --> 1:05:20.917
- Thursday, I think. Why?

1:05:23.745 --> 1:05:25.878
- Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

1:05:26.009 --> 1:05:28.185
and I need you to understand

1:05:28.315 --> 1:05:30.796
that it did not seem
like a big deal at the time.

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.192
- What do you...

1:05:35.322 --> 1:05:37.934
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

1:05:38.064 --> 1:05:41.546
- I saw Charles in the Slaphouse
District on Thursday.

1:05:41.676 --> 1:05:43.635
- You what?

1:05:43.765 --> 1:05:46.290
- He said he was meeting
a client.

1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:48.814
He asked me not to say
anything.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:51.686
- So you listened to Charles
over telling your best friend?

1:05:51.817 --> 1:05:53.862
- He said he didn't want you
to worry.

1:05:53.993 --> 1:05:55.473
I had no idea.

1:05:55.603 --> 1:05:57.736
- Lucy, this is huge!

1:05:57.866 --> 1:05:59.825
How could you not have
said anything?

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.566
- I didn't think there was
anything to say.

1:06:01.696 --> 1:06:05.004
Obviously, I was wrong.

1:06:05.135 --> 1:06:08.877
This might explain his behavior
for the last few weeks.

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:11.097
Cami, I'm sorry.

1:06:11.228 --> 1:06:12.969
- I have to go.

1:06:14.187 --> 1:06:16.973
- Hey. Let's figure this out
together.

1:06:18.496 --> 1:06:21.325
- Honestly, Lucy,
I think you've done enough.

1:07:07.284 --> 1:07:09.112
Lucy, talk to me!
- It was you!

1:07:09.242 --> 1:07:11.897
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:13.681
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:18.947
- No!

1:07:36.139 --> 1:07:39.011
- Lucy... I wasn't
expecting you today.

1:07:39.881 --> 1:07:42.058
- I need to figure out
what the hell is going on.

1:07:45.583 --> 1:07:48.281
- Okay, he hires you
to follow his wife,

1:07:48.412 --> 1:07:50.066
so he has tabs on you
at all times,

1:07:50.196 --> 1:07:52.633
then, he seduces you,

1:07:52.764 --> 1:07:55.375
then hires Dimitri
to terrorize you.

1:07:55.506 --> 1:07:58.335
- Yeah. I've been going over it
again and again.

1:07:58.465 --> 1:08:00.772
And I just keep asking myself
"why".

1:08:03.775 --> 1:08:07.213
- I think it all goes back
to this sick obsession.

1:08:07.344 --> 1:08:09.607
It's clear that he had
this fixation with you.

1:08:11.043 --> 1:08:12.653
- Yeah. But he had me.

1:08:12.784 --> 1:08:14.786
- Yeah. Not until
after the break-in.

1:08:16.569 --> 1:08:19.486
- He kept insisting that he'd
never seen Dimitri in his life.

1:08:19.617 --> 1:08:22.576
- Hey, it's perfectly normal
to second-guess yourself

1:08:22.707 --> 1:08:24.709
after such a traumatic event.

1:08:24.839 --> 1:08:27.014
But, Lucy, you did what
you had to do.

1:08:27.146 --> 1:08:29.104
Who knows what he might have
done to you?

1:08:31.019 --> 1:08:33.065
I don't know.

1:08:33.805 --> 1:08:35.719
The more I replay it in my mind,

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:39.550
the more I think he just
was genuinely confused.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.857
Like, he had no idea about
the break-in or any of it.

1:08:42.987 --> 1:08:44.555
- Yeah, well, the only way
to prove that

1:08:44.684 --> 1:08:46.469
would be to ask Dimitri.

1:08:50.517 --> 1:08:53.607
- August, there's a lot
that's not adding up.

1:08:53.737 --> 1:08:56.131
Dimitri is the only one that
can answer these questions.

1:08:56.262 --> 1:08:58.568
- Okay, you're the boss.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:00.136
I'm going with you.

1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:03.226
- Good.

1:09:37.346 --> 1:09:38.565
- Nice place.

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:40.306
- Yeah, you should've been here
last week.

1:09:41.438 --> 1:09:42.874
- What are you looking at?

1:09:44.528 --> 1:09:45.877
- Nothing.

1:09:48.619 --> 1:09:50.273
Huh, great.

1:09:50.403 --> 1:09:51.883
- You know him?

1:09:52.013 --> 1:09:53.841
- Yeah. Let's just say that.

1:09:53.971 --> 1:09:55.843
- Well, look who it is.

1:09:55.974 --> 1:09:58.368
- Yeah, good to see you.

1:10:12.817 --> 1:10:15.080
- I should have known
you two were working together.

1:10:16.647 --> 1:10:19.084
- Hi, Dimitri.
- What do you want?

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:22.000
- I need to tell me who hired
you to break into my house.

1:10:22.130 --> 1:10:23.654
- I already told this guy.

1:10:23.784 --> 1:10:25.090
His name was Clive.

1:10:28.353 --> 1:10:29.921
- You mean this guy, Clive?

1:10:35.535 --> 1:10:37.885
- What do I get
for ID'ing this person?

1:10:38.016 --> 1:10:38.930
Why should I help you?

1:10:41.148 --> 1:10:44.544
- If you don't cooperate,
I press charges

1:10:44.675 --> 1:10:47.939
and you get sent away again,
for a very long time.

1:10:54.162 --> 1:10:56.469
- I've never seen this guy
in my life.

1:11:00.691 --> 1:11:02.736
- You're sure?
- Positive.

1:11:02.867 --> 1:11:07.611
The Clive I met was shorter...
Trying to grow a moustache.

1:11:10.962 --> 1:11:12.616
Leave me alone.

1:11:26.064 --> 1:11:28.022
- It doesn't make any sense.

1:11:28.632 --> 1:11:32.112
- It's... It's just not
adding up.

1:11:34.333 --> 1:11:36.422
Hang on a sec.

1:11:59.706 --> 1:12:02.709
- Lucy! You okay?

1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:05.495
I'll be right out.

1:12:19.422 --> 1:12:21.206
What have you done?

1:12:24.252 --> 1:12:25.818
I killed him.

1:12:26.907 --> 1:12:29.040
I killed the wrong guy.

1:12:29.170 --> 1:12:30.911
- You thought you were
in danger.

1:12:31.041 --> 1:12:33.261
Anyone else would have done
the same thing.

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.655
- He was in love with me

1:12:35.786 --> 1:12:37.353
and I killed him.

1:12:39.224 --> 1:12:41.879
How could I have gotten
everything so wrong?

1:12:46.273 --> 1:12:47.710
- Wait a minute.

1:12:48.799 --> 1:12:50.670
Maybe you were supposed to.

1:12:52.933 --> 1:12:54.370
Hear me out.

1:12:55.719 --> 1:12:57.590
Whoever got Dimitri
to break into your house

1:12:57.721 --> 1:12:59.679
knew you were going
to find out it was Clive,

1:13:00.463 --> 1:13:03.030
and then that you would
confront him.

1:13:05.903 --> 1:13:07.557
- You think Adriana
would have wanted him dead?

1:13:07.687 --> 1:13:10.168
- He was a very wealthy man.

1:13:10.298 --> 1:13:13.432
People do bad things for money.
Really bad things.

1:13:13.563 --> 1:13:15.565
- Got any pings on that guy
she went out for dinner with

1:13:15.695 --> 1:13:17.567
the other night?
- None.

1:13:19.568 --> 1:13:22.267
- What was the description of
that guy Dimitri actually met?

1:13:22.398 --> 1:13:24.008
Can you see if there's
anything there?

1:13:24.138 --> 1:13:26.271
- Alright. Will do.
- I'm gonna go to The Regent.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:28.795
That's where he was staying.
See if I can get any info there.

1:13:28.925 --> 1:13:31.362
- Okay and I'll go to Adriana's,
see if I find anything.

1:13:31.494 --> 1:13:33.583
- Be careful.
- Yeah, you too.

1:14:31.641 --> 1:14:32.468
- Lucy?

1:14:34.644 --> 1:14:35.645
Lucy!

1:16:12.306 --> 1:16:13.699
- Lucy saw you with him.

1:16:15.745 --> 1:16:17.224
We'll deal with her later.

1:16:17.355 --> 1:16:19.139
Did you get the passports?

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:22.490
- You are now...

1:16:22.621 --> 1:16:25.318
Vanessa Armando.

1:16:27.407 --> 1:16:29.106
- Do you think
I can pull it off?

1:16:36.156 --> 1:16:39.682
- Did you...
drain all of his accounts?

1:16:39.812 --> 1:16:42.467
- Now that Clive is dead,
it all belongs to us.

1:16:52.999 --> 1:16:55.306
- Did you use the routing number
that Dean set up?

1:16:57.308 --> 1:16:58.831
- Right... the routing number.

1:16:59.876 --> 1:17:03.575
- Adriana, that
one's untraceable, right?

1:17:03.706 --> 1:17:06.577
We cannot leave until
the funds are in that account.

1:17:06.709 --> 1:17:09.233
- I'm sorry! I put the funds
in my account.

1:17:09.362 --> 1:17:11.278
I didn't think it would matter.
- Well, it does!

1:17:14.804 --> 1:17:16.893
You want people
to be able to find us?

1:17:17.023 --> 1:17:18.503
What's your password?

1:17:18.634 --> 1:17:19.809
- I think someone's out there.

1:17:22.768 --> 1:17:24.987
- Adriana, your password.

1:17:29.209 --> 1:17:30.689
Want some more wine?

1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:31.995
- Of course.

1:18:00.937 --> 1:18:01.981
- To us.

1:18:02.112 --> 1:18:04.680
To us.

1:18:09.554 --> 1:18:12.383
I love you so much.

1:18:12.513 --> 1:18:16.648
I cannot wait to start this next
chapter of our lives.

1:18:16.779 --> 1:18:18.389
Together.

1:18:34.579 --> 1:18:38.322
Finally free,
without Cami or Clive.

1:18:38.975 --> 1:18:41.717
Just you and me, together.

1:18:44.763 --> 1:18:47.070
- Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1:18:50.202 --> 1:18:51.901
- What?

1:18:59.865 --> 1:19:01.606
- He's changed
all his passwords.

1:19:50.394 --> 1:19:53.136
- After everything I've been
through to get here.

1:19:54.964 --> 1:19:58.358
The strings I pulled!
Clive is dead!

1:19:58.489 --> 1:20:01.666
- Don't lie to yourself.
You wanted him gone.

1:20:02.972 --> 1:20:04.712
If he would've found out
about us,

1:20:04.843 --> 1:20:06.496
he would have left you
with nothing.

1:20:07.193 --> 1:20:08.673
- The money.

1:20:13.068 --> 1:20:14.200
- What are you doing?

1:20:14.331 --> 1:20:16.202
- I'm stopping
the funds transfer.

1:20:16.333 --> 1:20:18.204
- Hey. I can't let you do that.

1:20:18.335 --> 1:20:20.337
- This isn't your money,
Charles.

1:20:30.651 --> 1:20:32.305
What did you do?

1:20:35.264 --> 1:20:36.788
But I love you.

1:21:04.772 --> 1:21:06.731
Oh no. No, no, no.

1:21:29.232 --> 1:21:31.669
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson of
Thompson Investigations.

1:21:31.799 --> 1:21:33.714
Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back
to you shortly.

1:21:33.844 --> 1:21:35.847
It's me!

1:21:35.978 --> 1:21:37.849
I'm sorry I overreacted
the other day.

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:40.243
I should not have blamed you for
what Charles has done.

1:21:42.853 --> 1:21:45.161
It turns out he was hiding a lot
more from me than I thought.

1:21:45.291 --> 1:21:46.902
I'm kicking him out!

1:21:48.338 --> 1:21:50.906
I love you. Call me back.

1:22:25.244 --> 1:22:28.594
Lucy. Hey!

1:22:36.342 --> 1:22:37.952
Lucy!

1:22:53.228 --> 1:22:54.447
Lucy!

1:22:59.017 --> 1:23:00.452
Damn it!

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:04.153
- August! It was Charles
and Adriana.

1:23:04.282 --> 1:23:05.981
I think he killed her.
Call me when you get this.

1:23:08.548 --> 1:23:09.680
Cami!

1:23:09.809 --> 1:23:11.943
- I'm here.

1:23:12.074 --> 1:23:14.598
- Okay. Hey... Hey, listen.

1:23:14.728 --> 1:23:16.382
I just watched Charles
kill Adriana.

1:23:16.513 --> 1:23:18.471
- What are you talking about?
- He wants to kill me now.

1:23:18.602 --> 1:23:20.559
Let's go.
- Lucy!

1:23:20.691 --> 1:23:22.127
Cami.
- Get out!

1:23:22.258 --> 1:23:23.650
- What?! No...
- Get out!

1:23:23.781 --> 1:23:25.217
- Cami, no, I can explain.

1:23:25.348 --> 1:23:26.610
Don't listen to Lucy,
she's crazy.

1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:28.394
- I know you're cheating
on me, Charles.

1:23:28.525 --> 1:23:30.353
And the gambling?
I know we're broke!

1:23:30.483 --> 1:23:32.442
You are the reason
Clive is dead!

1:23:32.572 --> 1:23:34.183
- No. Lucy is trying
to tear us apart.

1:23:34.313 --> 1:23:36.750
She's always been jealous
of what we have!

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:39.144
- You're a murderer and
I need you to get

1:23:39.275 --> 1:23:41.190
the hell out of my house
and out of my life.

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:43.627
Get out!
- This is all your fault!

1:23:43.757 --> 1:23:45.281
- No, Charles.
This is your fault!

1:23:45.411 --> 1:23:47.282
You're going to prison!

1:23:47.413 --> 1:23:49.589
- Don't listen to her.
Just don't listen to her, okay?

1:23:49.719 --> 1:23:52.157
I came back.
Look at this life we have, huh?

1:23:52.288 --> 1:23:54.594
I did this to protect that.
I did it all for you.

1:23:54.725 --> 1:23:56.509
- You're insane.

1:23:56.639 --> 1:23:58.555
- You don't understand,

1:23:59.556 --> 1:24:01.253
Cami, look.

1:24:01.384 --> 1:24:05.779
Look, just forget everything.
Alright? Yeah?

1:24:05.910 --> 1:24:07.651
I solved our money problems.

1:24:07.781 --> 1:24:09.740
Okay? We can be happy together.
I love you.

1:24:09.870 --> 1:24:12.743
- Okay, Charles... It's over.

1:24:19.967 --> 1:24:21.230
- Charles, wait!

1:24:22.231 --> 1:24:23.449
Stop!

1:24:23.580 --> 1:24:24.885
911, what is
your emergency?

1:24:25.016 --> 1:24:26.452
- Listen to me, listen to me.

1:24:26.583 --> 1:24:28.672
You came back.
That's all that matters.

1:24:28.802 --> 1:24:31.327
Hey, hey! You did
what you had to do for us.

1:24:31.457 --> 1:24:34.330
Look at me.
I see that now. Okay?

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:36.375
Alright, baby?

1:24:36.984 --> 1:24:38.464
For better for worse, right?

1:24:38.594 --> 1:24:40.423
Yeah.

1:24:49.519 --> 1:24:50.955
Lucy! Lucy!

1:24:53.784 --> 1:24:55.786
Ah!

1:24:57.831 --> 1:24:58.963
- You're okay.

1:25:00.486 --> 1:25:01.966
Hey, it's okay.

1:25:28.471 --> 1:25:30.516
- This guy was fast.
I was out of breath.

1:25:32.083 --> 1:25:34.085
- I've got news!
They love it.

1:25:34.216 --> 1:25:36.043
- Uh... Who loves what?

1:25:36.174 --> 1:25:38.002
- The publisher?
- They literally want to buy

1:25:38.133 --> 1:25:40.657
the rights to your story after
reading the first twenty pages.

1:25:40.787 --> 1:25:42.267
Lucy, this book is going
to be huge.

1:25:42.398 --> 1:25:45.183
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Our story is incredible.

1:25:45.314 --> 1:25:46.880
People are going
to want to hear it.

1:25:47.011 --> 1:25:48.186
- This is so exciting.

1:25:48.317 --> 1:25:49.927
- How is the rest
of the book coming?

1:25:50.057 --> 1:25:51.885
- It's going really well.

1:25:52.016 --> 1:25:53.931
It's been cathartic putting it
all down on paper.

1:25:54.061 --> 1:25:56.151
So, wait, what happens now?

1:25:56.281 --> 1:25:58.544
- Well, the publishers are going
to send over a contract

1:25:58.675 --> 1:26:00.938
and all you have to do is sign!

1:26:01.068 --> 1:26:03.245
You are going to love
the deal I got you.

1:26:03.375 --> 1:26:05.160
- I don't doubt that.
You're a shark.

1:26:05.290 --> 1:26:06.900
I am, aren't I?

1:26:07.031 --> 1:26:08.250
- So I'll see you
for dinner tonight?

1:26:08.380 --> 1:26:09.555
- You know it.
Are you coming, August?

1:26:09.686 --> 1:26:10.991
- Of course. I'll be there.

1:26:11.121 --> 1:26:12.514
- Amazing. Love you.

1:26:13.168 --> 1:26:14.691
- Love you.

1:26:14.821 --> 1:26:17.650
- Wow.
Lucy, congratulations!

1:26:17.781 --> 1:26:19.130
- Yeah, she thinks we've
really got something here.

1:26:19.261 --> 1:26:22.481
- Yeah, so do I. And I, for one,
can't wait to read it.

1:26:22.612 --> 1:26:24.701
- I have a feeling we're about
to get very busy.

1:26:24.831 --> 1:26:26.746
- Yeah. I think so!

1:26:26.877 --> 1:26:28.094
- Ready to dive in, partner?

1:26:28.226 --> 1:26:30.097
- I will do you proud,
Lucy Thompson.

1:26:30.228 --> 1:26:31.708
- I know you will.
Now, go back to work.
