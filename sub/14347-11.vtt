WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:07.598
Let me sleep.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.398
What are you doin'?

00:09.433 --> 00:11.431
Got something
for me, lover?

00:11.466 --> 00:15.232
I know it's early,
but Sondra can get you ready.

00:19.799 --> 00:22.598
Oh, I know she can.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.697
Sondra?

00:24.732 --> 00:25.863
Oh, shit!
What happened?

00:25.898 --> 00:28.030
- Did I fall asleep here?
- Kenny.

00:28.065 --> 00:30.430
Have I been here all night?
What'll I tell my wife?

00:30.465 --> 00:31.495
Maybe it's for the best.

00:31.530 --> 00:32.997
She's gonna find out
sooner or later.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.864
How did this happen?

00:36.630 --> 00:37.762
Wake up

00:37.797 --> 00:39.230
and turn off
the alarm, Kenny.

00:39.265 --> 00:40.528
What?

00:40.563 --> 00:43.329
I said, wake up
and turn off the alarm.

00:43.364 --> 00:45.629
You know
I can't reach it.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.863
Sorry.

00:49.895 --> 00:52.129
Must've been some dream
you were having.

00:52.164 --> 00:53.794
What do you mean?

00:53.829 --> 00:55.728
You had some big, old smile
on your face.

00:55.763 --> 00:57.628
What were you dreaming about,
you sickie?

00:57.663 --> 00:58.961
I don't remember.

00:58.996 --> 01:01.294
Was I in it?

01:01.329 --> 01:02.359
Yeah.

01:02.394 --> 01:04.327
I thought you said
you couldn't remember.

01:04.361 --> 01:05.492
Oh, Jesus.

01:05.527 --> 01:07.259
Do you have to start
first thing?

01:07.294 --> 01:09.527
I mean, if you're gonna give me
the third degree,

01:09.562 --> 01:11.760
can't you at least wait
till I have a cup of coffee?

01:14.827 --> 01:15.792
Oh, good, you're up.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.426
Did you go outside like that?

01:17.461 --> 01:18.557
Like what?

01:18.592 --> 01:20.425
Like that, with your joint
hanging out.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.258
Hey, you got issues
with the human body,

01:22.293 --> 01:23.424
that's your problem.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.225
That's your shame-based
religious upbringing

01:25.260 --> 01:26.709
rearing its ugly head.

01:26.744 --> 01:28.123
Speaking of ugly heads.

01:28.158 --> 01:30.558
Don't lay your issues on me.
I got no problems being naked.

01:30.593 --> 01:31.823
Oh, really?

01:31.858 --> 01:33.858
Why don't you go upstairs
and look in the mirror.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.858
There's more than one problem
going on down there.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.590
Michael, wait!

01:41.824 --> 01:43.557
Thank God I caught you.

01:43.592 --> 01:45.255
You forgot your biscotti.

01:45.290 --> 01:47.090
I stayed up all night
baking for nothing?

01:47.125 --> 01:48.055
Sorry, Ma.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.090
Is that a clean shirt?

01:49.125 --> 01:50.373
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:50.408 --> 01:51.622
I need a favor.

01:51.657 --> 01:52.754
A favor?

01:52.789 --> 01:54.389
Yeah, I spoke to Gina Gilardi
last night.

01:54.424 --> 01:55.486
You remember

01:55.521 --> 01:56.888
her youngest daughter,
Theresa?

01:56.923 --> 01:58.138
Mom, I can't be late.

01:58.173 --> 01:59.530
I'm gonna get in trouble.

01:59.565 --> 02:00.853
Lovely girl. An artist.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.655
She was involved for quite
a while with a man. Jewish.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.021
They never got married.

02:05.056 --> 02:06.053
Long story short,

02:06.088 --> 02:07.454
they had a terrible breakup,

02:07.489 --> 02:08.786
and she's been alone ever since.

02:08.821 --> 02:10.985
So I told Gina
that you would come home,

02:11.020 --> 02:13.754
and I said that maybe
you'd give Theresa a call,

02:13.789 --> 02:15.486
take her out,
you know, lift her spirit.

02:15.521 --> 02:17.187
- Ma!
- An old friend.

02:17.222 --> 02:18.818
I don't know her,

02:18.853 --> 02:20.319
and the Gilardi kids,
they're all ugly.

02:20.354 --> 02:22.085
- That's not true.
- Yeah.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.552
I was in class
with her brother Vinnie.

02:23.587 --> 02:24.985
We called him
"Gilardi the Retardi."

02:25.020 --> 02:27.151
That's unkind, Michael.

02:27.186 --> 02:29.452
Retarded people
have it very hard.

02:29.487 --> 02:30.652
I'm not taking her out, Mom.

02:30.687 --> 02:31.850
I'll see you tonight.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.317
So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

02:33.352 --> 02:34.282
You come home.

02:34.317 --> 02:35.282
You get your meals.

02:35.317 --> 02:37.317
You get your clothes
cleaned and pressed.

02:37.352 --> 02:39.317
But your mother asks you
for one favor...

02:39.352 --> 02:40.449
Go. Go.

02:40.484 --> 02:42.249
Fight your fires.
Have your fun.

02:42.284 --> 02:45.700
Hmph! I'll just stay here
and wait for you to come home

02:45.735 --> 02:49.117
so I can continue to cook
and clean and slave for you.

02:49.152 --> 02:50.082
Go!

02:50.117 --> 02:51.181
Have a wonderful day.

02:51.216 --> 02:52.515
All right,
I'll call her tomorrow.

02:52.550 --> 02:54.049
Tomorrow's no good.

02:54.084 --> 02:55.014
Why not?

02:55.049 --> 02:57.215
You're taking her out tonight.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.248
Give me another kiss.

03:05.715 --> 03:06.831
Hey, do me a favor?

03:06.866 --> 03:07.913
Here's the dog's leash.

03:07.948 --> 03:09.513
Take him out
for a couple of walks.

03:09.548 --> 03:11.747
Let him piss and shit,
but take him in the backyard.

03:11.782 --> 03:13.412
Nobody knows I have him,
all right?

03:13.447 --> 03:15.480
Another thing is,
make sure he has fresh water.

03:15.515 --> 03:16.997
If there's drool
on top of the water,

03:17.032 --> 03:18.656
that means it's not fresh,
all right?

03:18.691 --> 03:20.285
He needs to eat
around 4 or 4:30.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.844
I left the food
in the bottom of--

03:21.879 --> 03:23.844
Jesus, is there anything
else you want me to do?

03:23.879 --> 03:26.080
You sure you don't want me
to French kiss the bastard?

03:26.115 --> 03:28.312
Hey, I don't see you
kicking in any money

03:28.347 --> 03:29.511
for the rent around here,

03:29.546 --> 03:31.543
so the least you can do
is provide a service,

03:31.578 --> 03:34.044
besides flashin' your crank
for the neighbors, all right?

03:34.079 --> 03:36.511
I'll make sure everything's okay
for daddy's little baby.

03:36.546 --> 03:38.211
What'd ya say?

03:38.246 --> 03:39.842
Nothing.

03:39.877 --> 03:41.043
It's not my dog.

03:41.078 --> 03:42.561
It's the kids' dog.

03:42.596 --> 03:44.044
Fine. Have a good day.

03:44.079 --> 03:45.477
All right.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.530 --> 04:00.730
MOM

04:39.604 --> 04:42.005
Hey, I don't want mean
to be a pain in the balls--

04:42.040 --> 04:43.022
Too late.

04:43.057 --> 04:43.970
Heard that.

04:44.005 --> 04:45.037
That was the hope.

04:45.072 --> 04:46.904
Someone's been using
my bathroom.

04:46.939 --> 04:48.301
Oh, I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

04:48.336 --> 04:50.670
Maybe I could drop a dime
and call city hall

04:50.705 --> 04:53.004
so we can arrange
a press conference by noon.

04:53.039 --> 04:54.136
It's not a big deal,

04:54.171 --> 04:56.170
but I was given my own bathroom
for a reason,

04:56.205 --> 04:57.537
so if someone's
going in there,

04:57.572 --> 04:58.834
it kinda defeats
the purpose

04:58.869 --> 05:01.136
if I find a major
goddamn stink bomb from hell.

05:01.171 --> 05:02.636
Well, it's obviously
not me,

05:02.671 --> 05:03.934
because my shit smells

05:03.969 --> 05:05.668
like the perfume counter
at Saks.

05:05.703 --> 05:07.266
I'll bet.

05:07.301 --> 05:09.102
So I'll just assume
this is just an oversight

05:09.148 --> 05:10.280
and not a political statement

05:10.310 --> 05:11.723
involving burning off
my eyebrows.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.867
Thanks very much.

05:12.902 --> 05:15.101
Keep out of my bathroom.

05:16.634 --> 05:18.434
This is
what we got to put up with.

05:18.469 --> 05:19.968
You know what?

05:20.003 --> 05:21.432
It was me.

05:21.467 --> 05:22.832
What do you mean?
It was you?

05:22.867 --> 05:24.831
I had fruit cocktail,
and I warmed it up.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.499
I don't know how your stomach
is after warm fruit--

05:27.534 --> 05:28.767
A fire in the hole.

05:28.802 --> 05:29.965
Yeah, I was dying.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.299
I didn't even make it upstairs.

05:31.334 --> 05:32.666
I had to sneak
into her bathroom,

05:32.701 --> 05:33.999
and dropped off
a litter of kittens.

05:35.398 --> 05:36.565
I used it too.

05:38.032 --> 05:40.331
I spaced and went inside.
It's nice in there.

05:40.366 --> 05:41.764
Yeah, it's really nice.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.330
She's got candles
and soaps

05:43.365 --> 05:45.462
and real towels

05:45.497 --> 05:46.663
and little floor mats.

05:46.698 --> 05:48.297
And it smells like
the beach in there.

05:48.332 --> 05:50.162
Well, it did until I pooped.

05:50.197 --> 05:51.797
And you're so relaxed
when you're in there.

05:51.832 --> 05:53.496
It makes it just easier to go.

05:53.531 --> 05:54.862
It sounds lovely, girls,

05:54.897 --> 05:56.897
but I don't wanna hear
your friend's jaw flapping

05:56.932 --> 05:57.995
anymore, all right?

05:58.030 --> 06:00.263
So from now on,
do your business elsewhere.

06:00.298 --> 06:01.293
Ha ha!

06:01.328 --> 06:02.394
Big day, boys.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.327
- Franco.
- You hear, Sean?

06:04.362 --> 06:07.195
- What? Hear what?
- Calendar's out.

06:07.230 --> 06:08.594
Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.695
- Check it out, Lou.
- Let me see.

06:10.730 --> 06:11.993
Bam! Mr. March.

06:12.028 --> 06:13.559
Oh, very nice.

06:13.594 --> 06:15.528
That gladiator thing,
uh, works for you.

06:15.563 --> 06:16.593
Thanks.

06:16.628 --> 06:17.927
We got something in common now.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.227
Where's your partner in crime?

06:19.262 --> 06:20.226
Diciembre.

06:25.493 --> 06:26.825
Howdy, cowpoke!

06:26.860 --> 06:28.694
I didn't even wanna be
the goddamn cowboy

06:28.729 --> 06:30.311
in the first place, all right?

06:30.346 --> 06:31.719
Seriously, does it look stupid?

06:31.754 --> 06:33.123
No, no, hey, it looks great.

06:33.158 --> 06:34.457
I mean, look, it says to me,

06:34.492 --> 06:36.358
"I'm a macho,
you know, good-looking guy.

06:36.393 --> 06:38.225
I've been workin' hard
on the ranch all day,

06:38.260 --> 06:39.625
and now I'm takin'
a little break,

06:39.660 --> 06:40.923
just waitin'

06:40.958 --> 06:43.391
for my husband to come
pick me up and take me home."

06:43.426 --> 06:44.792
You know what?
That's really funny.

06:44.827 --> 06:46.024
This sucks.

06:46.059 --> 06:48.490
Hey, say that two days from now.
We got a signing event.

06:48.525 --> 06:50.158
We are gonna clean up.

06:50.193 --> 06:51.208
Yeah, you will.

06:51.243 --> 06:52.188
Hey, Seano,

06:52.223 --> 06:53.589
this thing
just hit the stores today.

06:53.624 --> 06:56.091
I had three skirts hit on me
on the way down here.

06:56.126 --> 06:57.455
I'm telling you, brother,

06:57.490 --> 06:59.690
having your picture here
is like a license to mint pussy.

06:59.725 --> 07:00.788
Mint pussy?

07:00.823 --> 07:02.589
One of the worst
Ben & Jerry flavors.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.272
Mint pussy?
Where'd that come from?

07:10.307 --> 07:11.820
I don't know.
It just came to me.

07:11.855 --> 07:13.422
I gotta start
writing that stuff down.

07:13.457 --> 07:14.387
Yeah, you do.

07:14.422 --> 07:15.387
This fast-truck shit sucks.

07:15.422 --> 07:16.986
Yeah, this is why
I became a fireman,

07:17.021 --> 07:19.120
so I could stand around
with my thumb up my ass

07:19.155 --> 07:21.185
while someone else goes in
and has all the fun.

07:21.220 --> 07:24.387
Yeah, might as well be bagging
groceries at the Shop-Rite.

07:24.422 --> 07:25.988
What do you want me
to do, chief?

07:26.023 --> 07:27.351
You just stay by the rig,

07:27.386 --> 07:30.054
make sure nothing gets stolen,
and button that jacket up.

07:30.089 --> 07:31.771
Oh, my God! Let me in!

07:31.806 --> 07:33.418
You've gotta let me in!

07:33.453 --> 07:35.450
Calm down. The
building's been evacuated.

07:35.485 --> 07:37.952
- The only people in there are--
- My dog's up there!

07:37.987 --> 07:40.119
What apartment? What apartment?

07:40.154 --> 07:41.417
5C.

07:41.452 --> 07:43.086
He's in the bedroom.

07:44.919 --> 07:45.968
The building's clear?

07:46.003 --> 07:46.983
Yeah, it should be.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.618
Tommy was here when
the transmission came in.

07:48.653 --> 07:50.383
- Where the hell did he go?
- I don't know.

07:50.418 --> 07:52.383
He was just here.
He didn't go inside, did he?

07:52.418 --> 07:55.650
If he did, he'll be out soon.
He doesn't have a mask.

07:55.685 --> 07:58.117
Hey, Ladder 6-2 to O.V.
Ladder 6-2 to O.V.--

07:58.152 --> 07:59.348
Oh, shit.

07:59.383 --> 08:01.382
What the hell is he doin'? Guy makes

08:01.417 --> 08:04.205
a couple of good grabs,
and he thinks he's Superman.

08:04.239 --> 08:05.234
When they start believing

08:05.256 --> 08:07.022
they're stronger than the bitch,
they end up dead.

08:07.065 --> 08:08.298
Gavin, what are you doing up there?

08:08.349 --> 08:10.150
Get him down here now.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.333
What's going on?

08:11.368 --> 08:12.482
Doesn't concern you.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.863
Jesus Christ.

08:31.898 --> 08:33.446
Oh, my God.

08:35.346 --> 08:36.980
How long has he
been up there?

08:37.015 --> 08:38.179
Two minutes.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.311
Son of a bitch.

08:39.346 --> 08:41.312
I'm gonna kill him
if he's not dead already.

08:44.178 --> 08:46.512
Hey, looks like you're
gonna get your chance.

08:47.779 --> 08:48.812
Good boy, good boy.

08:48.847 --> 08:49.879
What can I say?

08:49.914 --> 08:51.095
I love dogs.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.242
Thank you.

08:52.277 --> 08:53.442
You're welcome.

08:53.477 --> 08:55.045
What, are you
Doctor Dolittle now?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.778
Yeah.

08:59.744 --> 09:01.026
Nice goin', brother.

09:01.061 --> 09:02.274
Balls as big as yours,

09:02.309 --> 09:04.110
it's amazing you can
find pants that can fit.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.075
Yeah, yeah.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.276
See you downstairs.

09:09.209 --> 09:11.876
Hey, Tom, let me get
your opinion on something, okay?

09:11.911 --> 09:12.809
What?

09:14.909 --> 09:16.709
Do you think chicks
are gonna dig this picture,

09:16.744 --> 09:18.074
or do you think I look dorky?

09:18.109 --> 09:19.691
No, no, just the opposite. Really?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.274
Yeah, you look
like the Marlboro Man.

09:21.309 --> 09:22.873
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

09:22.908 --> 09:25.174
if the Marlboro Man smoked cock
instead of cigarettes.

09:26.908 --> 09:29.273
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Tom.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.541
Hey.

09:32.576 --> 09:34.006
Hey.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.141
I was wondering
if you could, um...

09:36.176 --> 09:38.074
educate me on something.

09:38.109 --> 09:39.471
What's that?

09:39.506 --> 09:41.506
What was that stunt
with the dog today?

09:43.205 --> 09:44.404
It's called firefighting.

09:44.439 --> 09:45.904
You know what?
You're the man, right?

09:45.939 --> 09:47.870
You got giant balls of steel.
You're the hero,

09:47.905 --> 09:50.571
and I'm catching all this shit,
'cause I'm the weak link?

09:50.606 --> 09:52.705
I'm the one that's gonna
get everybody killed?

09:52.740 --> 09:55.004
You're the weak link, Tommy.

09:55.039 --> 09:57.771
It's not okay. It's not on,
and they can't see it.

09:57.804 --> 09:59.567
And the saddest part is,
I think you know it.

09:59.598 --> 10:00.969
Let me tell you
something, sister.

10:01.004 --> 10:02.569
You serve two purposes
in this house, okay?

10:02.604 --> 10:05.303
You can give me a blow job,
or you can make me a sandwich.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.003
I'm not in the mood for head,
and I had a late breakfast,

10:08.038 --> 10:10.436
so you're shit out of luck.

10:17.136 --> 10:18.368
You okay?

10:21.635 --> 10:23.135
I can't do this.

10:23.170 --> 10:24.735
What's the matter?

10:24.770 --> 10:26.265
It's not fair to you,

10:26.300 --> 10:28.334
and it's not fair
to either of us.

10:28.369 --> 10:31.467
You're scaring me, Ken.

10:31.502 --> 10:33.299
You know...

10:33.334 --> 10:35.565
I love you, Phyll,

10:35.600 --> 10:38.500
and I never
wanted to hurt you.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.733
I'm seeing another woman.

10:44.832 --> 10:45.964
What?

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
I can't believe
that it happened.

10:48.034 --> 10:49.364
I mean...

10:49.399 --> 10:52.298
you know,
my life was going along

10:52.333 --> 10:53.530
exactly as it should,

10:53.565 --> 10:55.564
and then suddenly
it just jumped the track,

10:55.599 --> 10:57.564
and now I'm on
a completely different line.

10:57.599 --> 11:00.063
I'm sorry.

11:00.098 --> 11:02.396
Oh, Kenny.

11:02.431 --> 11:04.031
I'll move out if you want.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.662
No, it's okay.

11:05.697 --> 11:07.762
Life's so strange, you know?

11:07.797 --> 11:09.196
I mean,
it's like you walk around

11:09.231 --> 11:10.395
with this big problem,

11:10.430 --> 11:12.230
and you think
you're gonna have to take it

11:12.265 --> 11:13.830
to the grave with you,

11:13.865 --> 11:15.361
and then suddenly,

11:15.396 --> 11:17.494
God makes it okay
to talk about it.

11:17.529 --> 11:21.195
Well, look, I don't know
if God had any influence

11:21.230 --> 11:22.546
on my decision
or not--

11:22.581 --> 11:23.862
I'm not talking about you.

11:23.897 --> 11:25.228
What?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.261
I'm seeing somebody too.

11:29.561 --> 11:30.811
What?

11:30.846 --> 11:32.026
A man,

11:32.061 --> 11:33.325
and I've been feeling

11:33.360 --> 11:34.926
pretty rotten
about it too.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.394
Now, for the first time
in three months,

11:37.429 --> 11:38.492
I can breathe.

11:38.527 --> 11:40.327
Wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:40.362 --> 11:42.060
You're seeing another man?

11:42.095 --> 11:43.591
Yeah.

11:43.626 --> 11:44.691
For how long?

11:44.726 --> 11:46.726
Be three months
this Sunday.

11:46.761 --> 11:48.524
It started on a Sunday?

11:48.559 --> 11:51.792
Yeah. Told you you shoulda been
coming to Mass with me.

12:05.457 --> 12:07.391
Are you Mike?

12:07.426 --> 12:08.475
Yeah.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.524
Theresa?

12:09.559 --> 12:10.488
Hi.

12:10.523 --> 12:11.788
It's nice to meet you.

12:11.823 --> 12:15.556
This is so embarrassing,
having our mothers set us up.

12:15.591 --> 12:17.154
It totally sucks.

12:17.189 --> 12:20.922
Yeah, it totally does.

12:35.821 --> 12:36.971
Hey!

12:37.006 --> 12:38.086
What?

12:38.121 --> 12:40.318
Feel like joining me?

12:40.353 --> 12:42.121
What? I'm working like a dog here,

12:42.156 --> 12:43.220
and you're off in dreamland.

12:43.255 --> 12:44.452
I don't know.

12:44.482 --> 12:46.452
You feel like bringing something
to the party, or...

12:46.555 --> 12:48.696
Brought something to the party.
Check your undercarriage.

12:48.753 --> 12:49.556
What?

12:52.152 --> 12:53.219
What's the matter
with you?

12:53.254 --> 12:54.284
You're all distracted.

12:54.319 --> 12:55.486
What are you
thinking about?

12:55.521 --> 12:57.251
I'm sorry. I just...

12:57.286 --> 12:58.617
Ahh.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.318
That chick at work,
you know?

13:00.353 --> 13:01.350
Oh.

13:01.385 --> 13:03.085
That's nice.
That makes me feel--

13:03.120 --> 13:04.116
No, no, no, not--

13:04.151 --> 13:05.918
I'm not thinking
about her that way.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.018
Jesus, no.
She's just... Ahh!

13:08.053 --> 13:09.949
She's so annoying.

13:09.984 --> 13:11.118
Well, she's probably
a dyke.

13:11.153 --> 13:12.335
What do you expect?

13:12.370 --> 13:13.482
She just, you know--

13:13.517 --> 13:14.917
She's gotta have
her own bathroom.

13:14.952 --> 13:16.117
She's bitchin'
and moanin'

13:16.152 --> 13:17.114
about everything.

13:17.149 --> 13:18.366
You know,
she's got an opinion

13:18.401 --> 13:19.583
about every
goddamn subject

13:19.618 --> 13:20.615
under the sun.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.199
Well, you know
what they say.

13:23.234 --> 13:25.749
Opinions
are like assholes.

13:25.784 --> 13:26.949
Everyone has one.

13:28.515 --> 13:29.614
No, no.

13:29.649 --> 13:30.815
No, no.
Everyone has "them."

13:30.850 --> 13:31.949
Not "one."

13:31.984 --> 13:33.050
"Them."

13:33.085 --> 13:34.081
What?

13:34.116 --> 13:35.848
"Everyone has them," okay?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.814
Opinions.

13:39.981 --> 13:42.479
Yeah, but "one"
makes sense,

13:42.514 --> 13:44.913
because everyone
only has one asshole.

13:44.948 --> 13:45.878
Yeah, but everybody

13:45.913 --> 13:47.244
has more than one
opinion, okay?

13:47.279 --> 13:50.678
See, that's where
your logic is faulty.

13:50.713 --> 13:54.479
Yeah, can we
talk about something else?

13:54.514 --> 13:55.730
Cake looks good.

13:55.765 --> 13:56.971
You want some?

13:57.006 --> 13:58.209
Oh, no, I'm good.

13:58.244 --> 13:59.412
I'm trying to stay--

14:02.345 --> 14:04.378
So how's your brother?

14:04.413 --> 14:05.478
Which one?

14:05.513 --> 14:06.509
Vinnie.

14:06.544 --> 14:08.144
We were in the same
class, you know.

14:08.179 --> 14:09.628
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:09.663 --> 14:11.043
He's dead.

14:11.078 --> 14:12.777
You're kidding.

14:12.812 --> 14:14.342
Nope.

14:14.377 --> 14:16.377
Got high one night.
Went out for a walk.

14:16.412 --> 14:17.543
Got hit by a train.

14:17.578 --> 14:18.942
Wow.

14:18.977 --> 14:22.075
Well, Vinnie wasn't
the brightest, you know?

14:22.110 --> 14:24.342
My folks always said
it was just a matter of time

14:24.377 --> 14:26.643
before he stuck a fork
in a toaster

14:26.678 --> 14:28.909
or drove off a cliff
or something.

14:28.944 --> 14:31.043
They totally saw it coming.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.341
More coffee?

14:34.742 --> 14:36.239
You want
anything else?

14:36.274 --> 14:39.775
Oh, no, I'm good,
thank you.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.772
I was starving.

14:41.807 --> 14:43.739
I didn't eat all day

14:43.774 --> 14:46.540
'cause I thought
we were going out to dinner.

14:46.575 --> 14:49.341
Yeah, well,
that was the original--

14:49.376 --> 14:52.107
I just thought, you know,
coffee...

14:52.142 --> 14:53.506
was a little less formal.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.137
I just...

14:55.172 --> 14:57.040
thought
it might be good.

14:57.075 --> 14:58.906
And short.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.203
No.

15:00.238 --> 15:03.205
I seem to have
this strange power over men.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.170
They meet me for the first time,

15:05.205 --> 15:08.405
and they suddenly
get these amazing headaches.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.022
Well...

15:10.057 --> 15:11.604
guys.

15:14.137 --> 15:15.436
Let's be honest.

15:15.471 --> 15:17.503
You've thought
about getting a headache

15:17.538 --> 15:19.536
at some point
in the last 45 minutes,

15:19.571 --> 15:20.670
haven't you?

15:20.705 --> 15:22.635
No.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.568
It's okay.

15:24.603 --> 15:26.468
Look, you strike me

15:26.503 --> 15:29.402
as a very sweet,
very honest guy,

15:29.437 --> 15:32.536
so just
tell the truth.

15:32.571 --> 15:35.636
It would mean a lot.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.533
I...

15:38.568 --> 15:39.635
considered it.

15:43.301 --> 15:45.501
But you didn't go with it.

15:45.536 --> 15:46.733
I was planning on it.

15:46.768 --> 15:48.634
Then I watched the way
you demolished that cake,

15:48.669 --> 15:50.433
and I got too scared.

16:23.397 --> 16:24.462
It doesn't matter

16:24.497 --> 16:25.730
how many times
you explain it.

16:25.765 --> 16:26.695
It doesn't make sense!

16:26.730 --> 16:28.129
It makes
perfect sense, okay?

16:28.164 --> 16:29.430
Go back to the first part.

16:29.465 --> 16:30.664
"Opinions," okay? Plural.

16:30.699 --> 16:31.828
"Opinions are like assholes."

16:31.863 --> 16:33.730
If you say "opinions"
and "Everybody has one,"

16:33.765 --> 16:34.797
it doesn't agree.

16:34.832 --> 16:35.830
Agree with what?

16:35.865 --> 16:36.794
Basic English, okay?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.062
Things have to agree, okay?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.027
Tenses.

16:39.062 --> 16:40.027
Jesus Christ.

16:40.062 --> 16:41.328
Did you not go to school?

16:41.363 --> 16:42.929
Oh...

16:44.894 --> 16:46.677
Uh-huh.

16:46.712 --> 16:48.153
See this?

16:48.188 --> 16:49.559
Yeah.

16:49.594 --> 16:50.794
This is
butterscotch pudding

16:50.829 --> 16:51.960
that I made this afternoon.

16:51.995 --> 16:54.493
I was gonna let you
lick it off my tits,

16:54.528 --> 16:55.627
but guess what!

16:55.662 --> 16:56.744
You blew it!

16:56.779 --> 16:57.827
Forget it!

17:02.126 --> 17:03.524
Yeah?

17:03.559 --> 17:06.192
Well, you-- You shoulda
mentioned the pudding first.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.023
I've started doing portraits.

17:09.059 --> 17:11.325
Maybe you could
sit for me some day,

17:11.359 --> 17:13.858
if I ever see you again.

17:13.894 --> 17:16.323
Oh, you'll
see me again.

17:16.358 --> 17:17.790
Why do you say
stuff like that?

17:17.826 --> 17:19.691
Experience.

17:22.057 --> 17:24.156
This has been fun.

17:24.191 --> 17:25.922
Thanks.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.490
You're welcome.

17:27.525 --> 17:28.840
You, uh...

17:28.875 --> 17:30.121
wanna come in?

17:30.156 --> 17:31.389
I should probably go--

17:35.489 --> 17:37.187
Theresa,
I can't do this.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.656
Sure you can.
I'll show you how.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.023
No, Theresa.

17:42.188 --> 17:44.320
I'll be the best you ever had.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.588
I don't care how many women
you've slept with.

17:47.623 --> 17:49.538
Hundreds, thousands.

17:49.573 --> 17:51.419
One time with me,

17:51.454 --> 17:55.088
you won't remember a
single one of 'em.

17:55.123 --> 17:58.088
I mean it, Mike.

18:00.219 --> 18:03.453
I guess I could come in
for a few minutes.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.135
You gonna stop seeing him?

18:09.170 --> 18:10.485
You gonna stop seeing her?

18:14.452 --> 18:15.685
Who is this guy?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.135
Who's the girl?

18:17.170 --> 18:18.327
Do I know him?

18:18.362 --> 18:19.484
Do I know her?

18:22.985 --> 18:24.316
You know what?

18:24.351 --> 18:27.517
Maybe we shouldn't be
asking questions right now.

18:27.552 --> 18:28.750
Maybe not.

18:30.516 --> 18:31.949
You know what?

18:31.984 --> 18:34.316
Let me just say this, okay?

18:38.182 --> 18:40.014
If you told me what you told me,

18:40.049 --> 18:41.882
and I didn't have
something going on the side,

18:41.917 --> 18:43.415
I would have been
so goddamn pissed,

18:43.450 --> 18:44.514
you wouldn't believe it.

18:44.549 --> 18:46.349
Well, you know,
I'd be pissed too.

19:02.313 --> 19:03.347
Wow.

19:05.113 --> 19:06.412
Congratulations.

19:06.447 --> 19:08.244
What?

19:08.279 --> 19:10.013
You just did
your first fat chick.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.913
You wanna go again?

19:13.479 --> 19:14.646
You're kidding.

19:14.681 --> 19:15.610
No.

19:15.645 --> 19:17.261
My mother said
your mother said

19:17.296 --> 19:18.878
you could do it
twice in a row.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.144
My mother may be right.

19:26.877 --> 19:28.377
Hey, Asshole!

19:30.310 --> 19:31.877
Hey, pal, how are ya?

19:31.912 --> 19:33.009
What's goin' on?

19:33.044 --> 19:34.176
How was your day, huh?

19:34.211 --> 19:36.141
How's it goin'?

19:36.176 --> 19:38.576
Where do you keep
the salt and pepper?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.409
- Who the hell are you?
- Arlo.

19:40.444 --> 19:41.510
I'm Teddy's friend.

19:41.545 --> 19:42.541
You must be Tommy.

19:42.576 --> 19:43.942
Can you pass
the salt, please?

19:43.977 --> 19:45.140
Sure.

19:45.175 --> 19:46.408
Yeah. Here you go.

19:48.308 --> 19:49.475
Oh, finally.
You're home.

19:49.510 --> 19:50.574
The dog puked twice.

19:50.609 --> 19:51.809
Don't worry.
I cleaned it up.

19:51.844 --> 19:52.773
Puked from what?

19:52.808 --> 19:54.574
Two Slim Jims and a frappuccino.

19:54.609 --> 19:55.940
What are you, nuts?

19:55.975 --> 19:58.240
Well, not a whole frappuccino.

19:58.275 --> 19:59.205
Come here, pal.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.706
Hey, he was beggin'.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.073
Look at that face.
How am I supposed to deny that?

20:03.108 --> 20:05.406
Man, the goddamn phone's
been ringing off the hook

20:05.441 --> 20:06.624
for the last couple of hours.

20:06.659 --> 20:07.966
Why didn't you answer it?

20:08.001 --> 20:09.238
Hey, this isn't
my house.

20:09.273 --> 20:11.306
Plus, we were watchin' some show
about doctors

20:11.341 --> 20:12.539
on the Lifetime Channel.

20:12.574 --> 20:13.606
What's it called?

20:13.641 --> 20:14.640
Good Medicine?

20:14.675 --> 20:15.604
Strong Medicine.

20:15.639 --> 20:16.639
Can you take this, please?

20:16.674 --> 20:18.004
Yeah, here you go.

20:18.039 --> 20:20.138
Arlo's gonna be crashin' with us
for a couple days,

20:20.173 --> 20:21.805
- if that's okay.
- Yeah, um...

20:21.840 --> 20:23.403
Who is this guy?

20:23.438 --> 20:25.638
This is him, the guy
who won your money last week

20:25.673 --> 20:26.603
at the track.

20:26.638 --> 20:28.071
That's the golden midget.

20:28.106 --> 20:29.469
Don't piss me off,
Teddy.

20:29.504 --> 20:31.704
You know I hate
that "midget" shit.

20:31.739 --> 20:32.802
Right.

20:32.837 --> 20:34.236
Okay, I'm sorry, pal.
Check it out.

20:34.271 --> 20:35.435
1100 in cash,

20:35.470 --> 20:37.103
all thanks to him
winning at the track.

20:37.138 --> 20:38.254
He's a genius!

20:38.289 --> 20:39.335
What's his system?

20:39.370 --> 20:40.970
Well, he always wanted to be
a jockey,

20:41.005 --> 20:42.287
but they said he was too small,

20:42.322 --> 20:43.534
so he hung around the track,

20:43.569 --> 20:45.169
waiting for somebody
to give him a break.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.501
Turns out,

20:46.538 --> 20:47.793
he can read the horses' faces.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.690
- He reads their faces?
- He's the perfect height.

20:49.771 --> 20:52.243
He can tell if they're angry.
He can tell if they're happy.

20:52.368 --> 20:53.700
They're staring
right down at him.

20:53.735 --> 20:55.168
You heard of
The Horse Whisperer, right?

20:55.203 --> 20:56.133
Yeah.

20:56.168 --> 20:57.700
The horses whisper to him.

20:57.735 --> 20:59.198
You can tell
Robert Redford

20:59.233 --> 21:01.434
he can kiss
my little black ass, huh?

21:01.469 --> 21:02.551
How long's he gonna stay?

21:02.586 --> 21:03.599
Hey, that's the thing.

21:03.634 --> 21:05.198
We hope he stays
as long as possible.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.801
He keeps winning like this,
I can buy my own place.

21:07.836 --> 21:10.101
Hey, can you pass me
the napkins, please?

21:10.136 --> 21:12.366
All right,
but I'll tell you one thing:

21:12.401 --> 21:14.132
we gotta get him a ladder.

21:15.299 --> 21:16.331
Tommy, thank God.

21:16.366 --> 21:17.499
I've been calling all night.

21:17.534 --> 21:18.566
I called everywhere.

21:18.601 --> 21:19.599
What's goin' on?

21:20.599 --> 21:21.882
I just came
from the hospital.

21:21.917 --> 21:23.165
Is something wrong
with the kids?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.865
No, um, it's your mother.

21:27.197 --> 21:29.065
She had a heart attack.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.831
Is she okay?

21:32.664 --> 21:33.729
She's dead, Tommy.

21:33.764 --> 21:35.831
She died
a half-hour ago.

21:49.029 --> 21:50.294
What's goin' on?

21:50.329 --> 21:51.829
Didn't get much sleep.

21:53.128 --> 21:54.729
That's understandable.

21:54.764 --> 21:56.328
Jeez.

21:58.028 --> 22:00.561
Want me to make some coffee?

22:00.596 --> 22:02.426
No, your coffee sucks.

22:02.461 --> 22:04.094
Should have
taken some lessons

22:04.129 --> 22:05.358
from your mother.

22:05.393 --> 22:06.759
She did a million things wrong,

22:06.794 --> 22:09.027
but she knew how to make
a good cup of coffee.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.794
It's my fault, Tommy.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.395
Don't start, Dad.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.961
I killed her.

22:13.996 --> 22:15.090
Oh, God.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.925
You know, that stuff with Teddy,

22:18.960 --> 22:22.891
that selfish, stupid
couple of weeks.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.858
All the worry I gave her,
all the heartache.

22:26.893 --> 22:28.992
Now she's gone.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.457
The last 10 years wasn't great.

22:33.492 --> 22:35.157
It's not your fault, Dad.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.223
She annoyed me.

22:38.258 --> 22:39.222
I annoyed her.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.424
The passion we had,
what little was left,

22:41.459 --> 22:43.224
we channeled into...

22:43.259 --> 22:44.990
pissing each other off,

22:45.025 --> 22:48.356
but now, God...

22:51.723 --> 22:53.889
What I wouldn't give...

22:53.924 --> 22:56.056
for another 10 years.

22:57.789 --> 22:59.420
Dad.

22:59.455 --> 23:01.886
You know,

23:01.921 --> 23:06.287
my father cried a lot
toward the end of his life.

23:09.588 --> 23:12.887
He never cried before then,
probably not even as a baby.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.485
But near the end,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.020
you'd look at him cross-eyed,
and he'd bust out bawling.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.586
It's the ghosts, Tommy.

23:28.385 --> 23:30.550
It's the what?

23:30.585 --> 23:33.451
All the people
you hurt,

23:33.486 --> 23:36.318
all the meanness you did.

23:36.353 --> 23:38.216
You get old.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.984
You stop moving
at a million miles a minute...

23:42.817 --> 23:44.600
and it all comes back.

23:44.635 --> 23:46.326
It really shows up again.

23:46.361 --> 23:48.017
And all you can do...

23:53.249 --> 23:55.082
All you can do is cry.

23:57.716 --> 23:59.882
Go on,
get out of here.

23:59.917 --> 24:02.049
Make your
suck-ass coffee.

24:02.084 --> 24:03.381
Okay.

24:14.447 --> 24:16.163
Morning, Mrs. Weaver.

24:16.198 --> 24:17.589
Good morning,
Mr. Shea.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.980
Beautiful day today.

24:19.015 --> 24:20.077
Very nice.

24:20.112 --> 24:21.146
Have a good one.

24:21.181 --> 24:22.847
You too.

24:22.882 --> 24:24.447
Mrs. Weaver?

24:24.482 --> 24:25.978
Can I help you?

24:26.013 --> 24:27.343
Yeah, I think you can.

24:27.378 --> 24:30.361
I don't really know
how to say this,

24:30.396 --> 24:33.345
but I think
my wife's having an affair.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.243
Well, I--

24:35.278 --> 24:37.476
I'm so sorry to hear that,

24:37.511 --> 24:40.677
but I don't see
how it is of any concern to me.

24:40.712 --> 24:43.844
It's just that, you know,
you're home all day,

24:43.879 --> 24:46.441
and you see who comes.
You see who goes.

24:46.476 --> 24:49.343
I don't stick my nose
into other people's business.

24:49.378 --> 24:52.610
I have never been
that kind of person.

24:54.677 --> 24:56.307
But I've seen him.

24:56.342 --> 24:59.142
Yes, he comes at lunchtime
every now and then,

24:59.177 --> 25:01.407
but mostly nights,

25:01.442 --> 25:03.625
when you're working
a double shift.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.933
Three nights
in the last two weeks.

25:05.968 --> 25:08.207
The 15th, the 18th
and the 22nd.

25:08.242 --> 25:09.973
Interesting.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.875
You wouldn't happen to know
who this guy is, would you?

25:12.910 --> 25:16.340
I have my own life
to lead, Mr. Shea.

25:16.375 --> 25:17.907
Understood.

25:19.607 --> 25:21.006
Greg Kelly,

25:21.041 --> 25:24.372
over at the firehouse
on Lincoln.

25:26.573 --> 25:27.906
He's a fireman?

25:27.941 --> 25:29.390
Oh, yes.

25:29.425 --> 25:30.804
Hey, uh...

25:30.839 --> 25:32.040
how's your old man
doin', Tom?

25:32.075 --> 25:33.336
Best as can be
expected.

25:33.371 --> 25:35.872
I asked him if he wanted
to move in with me,

25:35.907 --> 25:37.572
but he doesn't
wanna hear that.

25:37.607 --> 25:38.656
You okay, Tom?

25:38.691 --> 25:39.798
Yeah, I'm good.

25:39.833 --> 25:40.870
I mean, you know,

25:40.905 --> 25:42.039
at least she didn't suffer.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.137
You know, it was fast.

25:48.070 --> 25:49.570
Firehouse.

25:49.605 --> 25:51.070
Yeah, hang on.

25:51.105 --> 25:52.201
Probie?

25:52.236 --> 25:53.403
Hey, Probie!
Probie!

25:53.438 --> 25:54.868
What's up?

25:54.903 --> 25:56.570
Phone. Some Theresa broad.

25:58.836 --> 26:02.168
Hey, how's it goin'?

26:02.203 --> 26:04.734
Oh, yeah.

26:04.769 --> 26:06.602
Um, can I
call you back?

26:06.637 --> 26:08.435
Okay, great.

26:08.470 --> 26:09.652
Thanks.

26:09.687 --> 26:10.834
Sounds hot.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.000
What?

26:12.035 --> 26:13.399
The broad.

26:13.434 --> 26:15.566
- Sounds hot.
- Oh, yeah.

26:15.601 --> 26:17.001
Did you get anything
off her yet?

26:17.036 --> 26:18.485
Only the best I've ever had.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.935
Okay, fellas,
listen up.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.000
We have a problem.

26:21.035 --> 26:22.198
Oh, no.

26:22.233 --> 26:25.000
Someone used
milady's commode again?

26:25.035 --> 26:26.098
Listen, fellas,

26:26.133 --> 26:27.599
I have
four older brothers,

26:27.634 --> 26:29.483
so when I go
in the bathroom

26:29.518 --> 26:31.308
and find a huge,
steaming dump,

26:31.343 --> 26:33.098
it's more like
a fond memory

26:33.133 --> 26:34.397
than anything else.

26:34.432 --> 26:36.032
I don't know
who the culprit is,

26:36.067 --> 26:37.449
but I have two things
to say to you.

26:37.484 --> 26:38.857
First, get yourself
to a hospital,

26:38.892 --> 26:40.196
because if that came out of you,

26:40.231 --> 26:42.264
you got, like,
maybe a month to live.

26:42.299 --> 26:43.197
And second...

26:44.531 --> 26:45.731
watch your back.

26:45.766 --> 26:47.296
Game is on.

26:47.331 --> 26:49.363
This keeps up,
it's just gonna get unpleasant.

26:49.398 --> 26:50.714
Are we clear?

26:50.749 --> 26:52.031
- Yeah.
- Crystal.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.730
Hey, come on, guys, huh?

26:54.765 --> 26:55.829
Enough is enough.

26:55.864 --> 26:56.996
If you don't like Laura,

26:57.031 --> 26:58.429
if you don't
want her here, fine.

26:58.464 --> 27:00.094
There's no reason

27:00.129 --> 27:01.329
why anybody
should leave something

27:01.364 --> 27:03.027
the size of an Easter ham

27:03.062 --> 27:04.462
in the bottom
of her toilet bowl.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.160
Okay?

27:06.195 --> 27:08.695
Thank you.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.495
I heard about
your mother.

27:11.530 --> 27:12.662
I'm sorry.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.760
Thanks.

27:13.795 --> 27:14.994
Hey, seriously, guys,

27:15.029 --> 27:16.460
there are limits
to what's funny.

27:16.495 --> 27:20.260
Somebody here
has clearly gone too far--

27:20.295 --> 27:21.659
So?

27:21.694 --> 27:22.692
So last night,

27:22.727 --> 27:24.394
I go out
for this big Mexican meal,

27:24.429 --> 27:25.526
and then I come home,

27:25.561 --> 27:27.777
and I cook up a pot
of Brussels sprouts.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.993
And this morning,
I had eggs with salsa

27:30.028 --> 27:31.860
and then half a bag of Oreos.

27:34.326 --> 27:36.559
You shoulda seen
the size of the thing I left.

27:36.594 --> 27:37.757
It was like an anaconda.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.725
I swear to God,
I think it had a heartbeat.

27:41.659 --> 27:45.658
And that, gentlemen,
is why he wears the white shirt.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.690
Pop's having
a rough time.

27:56.725 --> 27:57.788
Yeah.

27:57.823 --> 27:58.989
To be expected, I guess.

27:59.024 --> 28:00.757
They were married for,
what, 54 years?

28:00.792 --> 28:02.288
Yeah.

28:02.323 --> 28:03.957
I bawled my eyes out
when I heard.

28:03.992 --> 28:05.207
Me too.

28:05.242 --> 28:06.365
Thank you.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.454
I'm sorry.

28:07.489 --> 28:08.656
Thanks for coming.

28:08.691 --> 28:09.823
Thank you.

28:09.858 --> 28:11.373
Thank you.

28:11.408 --> 28:12.854
Thank you.

28:12.889 --> 28:14.255
Hey, you know,
you shoulda,

28:14.290 --> 28:16.022
seeing how
you predicted it.

28:16.057 --> 28:17.720
I got pulled over by a cop.

28:17.755 --> 28:19.521
I was using
a bullshit excuse, okay?

28:19.556 --> 28:21.253
You gonna bust my balls
for that?

28:21.288 --> 28:23.887
You're gonna have to keep
a close eye on him.

28:23.922 --> 28:24.986
Why is it always me?

28:25.021 --> 28:26.537
Okay, what about you?
What about Johnny?

28:26.572 --> 28:28.018
What about
one of our wonderful sisters?

28:28.046 --> 28:30.012
I told you, I'm taking off
to the Bahamas in two days.

28:30.051 --> 28:31.385
That's great. That's just great.

28:31.504 --> 28:33.945
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, thanks for coming.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.819
Of course.

28:35.854 --> 28:38.184
Hey.

28:38.219 --> 28:39.986
I'm gonna talk to Uncle Teddy.

28:40.021 --> 28:41.184
Yeah.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.935
How you doin'?

28:42.970 --> 28:44.652
Doing all right.

28:54.951 --> 28:57.150
I'm gonna take a break
for a couple of minutes,

28:57.185 --> 28:58.083
all right?

29:03.249 --> 29:04.416
What the hell was that?

29:04.451 --> 29:05.548
What the hell was what?

29:05.583 --> 29:06.816
You know what I'm talking about.

29:06.851 --> 29:08.017
All eyes on us, okay?

29:08.052 --> 29:09.181
I'm sorry.

29:09.216 --> 29:10.348
I was just being supportive.

29:10.383 --> 29:11.647
Look, we both know

29:11.682 --> 29:14.282
there's a line
we're not supposed to cross.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.715
I am here
because I am family,

29:16.750 --> 29:17.714
and because I wanted

29:17.749 --> 29:19.313
to offer you
a shoulder to cry on.

29:19.348 --> 29:20.948
Not that you ever would,
you sick bastard.

29:20.983 --> 29:22.565
Your mother's lying over there
in a coffin,

29:22.600 --> 29:24.490
and you're still
a freakin' block of ice.

29:24.525 --> 29:26.253
- I could cry if I wanted, okay?
- Bullshit.

29:26.288 --> 29:27.981
Somebody has to be in charge
around here.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.144
It happens to be me, okay?

29:29.179 --> 29:30.380
Somebody's gotta
stay in control.

29:30.415 --> 29:31.411
You're such an asshole.

29:31.446 --> 29:32.914
Yeah, you just
watch yourself, okay?

29:37.213 --> 29:38.411
Hi.

29:38.446 --> 29:40.395
Pop-Pop, I'm so sorry.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.345
Sheila, thank you.

29:44.279 --> 29:46.746
You take care
of yourself.

29:52.012 --> 29:53.378
She's all torn up.

29:53.413 --> 29:55.278
She sure is.

30:02.110 --> 30:03.609
You're leaving?

30:03.644 --> 30:05.008
I gotta go to a wake.

30:05.043 --> 30:07.943
A guy in the firehouse,
his mom died.

30:07.978 --> 30:09.241
Oh.

30:09.276 --> 30:10.441
Well, I'll go with you.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.676
It'll be
like our first date

30:11.711 --> 30:12.641
as a couple.

30:12.676 --> 30:13.843
I don't think so.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.342
I'm kidding.

30:15.377 --> 30:17.076
Oh.

30:17.111 --> 30:18.740
Is...

30:18.775 --> 30:21.208
this just sex, Mike?

30:22.675 --> 30:23.974
Is it?

30:24.009 --> 30:25.273
It was before.

30:25.308 --> 30:29.038
Now... I don't know.

30:29.073 --> 30:31.841
You're not ashamed of me,
are you?

30:31.876 --> 30:34.073
No. Why would you say that?

30:34.108 --> 30:36.524
I mean, you're smart.

30:36.559 --> 30:38.940
You make me laugh.

30:38.975 --> 30:40.724
I thought...

30:40.759 --> 30:42.438
This wake...

30:42.473 --> 30:46.238
Maybe you didn't wanna bring
your fat girlfriend

30:46.273 --> 30:48.339
where your friends
might see her.

30:48.374 --> 30:50.405
I don't care
about my friends, okay?

30:52.705 --> 30:54.371
I care about you.

31:20.536 --> 31:21.851
Hi.

31:21.886 --> 31:23.132
Hi.

31:23.167 --> 31:25.568
I know you
from someplace.

31:25.603 --> 31:27.502
I work with Tommy.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.401
You're a fireman?

31:29.436 --> 31:30.951
Yeah, yeah.

31:30.986 --> 31:32.432
That's it.

31:32.467 --> 31:34.100
You're December.

31:34.135 --> 31:35.834
Oh, boy.

31:35.869 --> 31:37.499
Yeah, yeah.

31:37.534 --> 31:39.100
I just got
the calendar.

31:39.135 --> 31:40.417
Oh, you did?

31:40.452 --> 31:41.664
Is it goofy?

31:41.699 --> 31:43.164
I didn't think so.

31:43.199 --> 31:44.564
I mean, some of the other guys,

31:44.599 --> 31:46.766
but I thought your picture
was the best.

31:46.801 --> 31:49.533
I mean, really the best.

31:51.298 --> 31:54.098
Can I get your number,
and I'll call you?

31:54.133 --> 31:56.632
Sure. You got a pen?

31:56.667 --> 31:59.131
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.362
Shoot.

32:00.397 --> 32:02.697
It's Karen...

32:09.664 --> 32:10.763
So how you doin'?

32:10.798 --> 32:11.928
Great.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.579
Everybody keeps asking me
how I'm doing.

32:13.614 --> 32:15.196
My mother died
of a goddamn heart attack.

32:15.231 --> 32:16.596
Yeah, I'm doin' a jig over here.

32:16.631 --> 32:18.162
What's with Sheila?

32:19.996 --> 32:21.060
She's upset.

32:21.095 --> 32:22.578
Yeah, she seemed
a little overcome.

32:22.613 --> 32:24.061
Well, she was
particularly close

32:24.096 --> 32:25.260
to my mom.

32:25.295 --> 32:27.295
She used to call her
"The Curse of the Irish."

32:27.330 --> 32:29.526
I-I never heard that.
Oh, you know what?

32:29.561 --> 32:32.027
If you are screwing around with
her, that is some dark shit.

32:32.062 --> 32:34.094
- I'm not screwing with her.
- Jimmy was your best friend.

32:34.129 --> 32:35.828
I know who Jimmy was.

32:35.863 --> 32:37.528
Thanks for coming.

32:37.563 --> 32:39.158
Bye.

32:39.193 --> 32:40.860
I hope you're
telling me the truth.

32:43.293 --> 32:45.226
I don't have to tell you
anything.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.224
Hey.

32:56.259 --> 32:57.556
What was that?

32:57.591 --> 33:00.157
Another chapter
of my own personal purgatory.

33:00.192 --> 33:01.424
Never ends.

33:03.791 --> 33:05.958
So, what's going on
with you and Sheila?

33:05.993 --> 33:08.423
You're shittin' me, right?

33:08.458 --> 33:10.021
I hope you're not

33:10.056 --> 33:11.489
getting involved
with her, Tom.

33:11.524 --> 33:13.722
Okay, first of all,
I'm not involved with her, okay?

33:13.757 --> 33:16.789
Second of all, even if I was,
it's none of your business.

33:16.824 --> 33:17.821
Listen, take my advice.

33:17.856 --> 33:19.156
Yeah, I'm gonna take
your advice.

33:19.191 --> 33:20.623
I'm gonna take advice
about a broad

33:20.658 --> 33:22.055
from a guy who hasn't
banged a broad

33:22.090 --> 33:23.089
in almost 30 years.

33:23.124 --> 33:24.089
They're different now.

33:34.288 --> 33:37.454
You gotta be shittin' me.

33:40.087 --> 33:41.954
Jesus Christ, Mick.

33:41.989 --> 33:43.786
What do you think

33:43.821 --> 33:45.218
the Catholic Church
would have to say

33:45.253 --> 33:47.186
- if they heard about that?
- Well, considering

33:47.221 --> 33:48.353
she's not
a 13-year-old boy,

33:48.388 --> 33:49.451
I think
they'd be thrilled.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.119
Oh, really? What would
your friends and family say

33:52.154 --> 33:54.752
if they knew you were banging
your dead cousin's wife?

33:54.787 --> 33:55.817
Hey, don't poke me, man.

33:55.852 --> 33:57.852
- Don't poke me, pal.
- Don't poke me.

33:57.887 --> 33:58.903
You wanna go?

33:58.938 --> 33:59.884
Hey, man!

33:59.919 --> 34:01.485
You son of a bitch!

34:07.652 --> 34:09.583
Hey! What the--
Stop!

34:09.618 --> 34:10.851
Tommy, what are you doing?

34:10.886 --> 34:11.815
Hey, Tommy! Mickey!

34:11.851 --> 34:13.217
Mickey, come on!
Jesus!

34:13.252 --> 34:14.568
Jesus, Mickey,
come on!

34:14.603 --> 34:15.849
Kiss my ass, Mickey!

34:15.884 --> 34:18.083
Blame him.
He started it!

34:18.118 --> 34:19.047
Stop it!

34:19.083 --> 34:20.447
Come on, now.

34:20.483 --> 34:22.949
Hey, hey, your mother's
lying inside in a casket.

34:22.984 --> 34:24.516
You'll burn in hell for this.

34:27.916 --> 34:29.165
There you go.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.324
Thank you.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.449
Thanks a lot.

34:32.915 --> 34:33.981
God, this is incredible.

34:34.016 --> 34:35.012
Yeah, told you, man.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.146
I've got
10 numbers already.

34:36.181 --> 34:37.414
It's like a goddamn
pussy buffet.

34:37.449 --> 34:39.398
Hey, sweetheart.

34:39.433 --> 34:40.906
Love that smile.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.380
Hey, how's it goin'?

34:42.415 --> 34:43.344
Great.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.530
Love the picture.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.679
Thank you. Thanks.

34:45.715 --> 34:47.011
So, uh...

34:47.045 --> 34:48.714
are you really into it?

34:48.748 --> 34:50.612
- Into what?
- W.S.

34:50.648 --> 34:52.010
W.S.?

34:52.045 --> 34:53.710
Water sports.

34:53.746 --> 34:55.145
Oh, no, no.
See, I'm the cowboy.

34:55.179 --> 34:56.578
The deep-sea diver guy,

34:56.612 --> 34:58.212
he's Mr. July
down on the end there.

34:58.247 --> 35:00.976
I thought...

35:01.011 --> 35:03.745
I mean, that handkerchief's
pretty obvious.

35:03.780 --> 35:05.979
What handkerchief?

35:08.278 --> 35:10.210
Like you don't know.

35:10.245 --> 35:11.642
Know what?

35:11.677 --> 35:12.876
I really don't.

35:12.911 --> 35:16.309
Well, in some gay circles,

35:16.344 --> 35:18.544
if you put a yellow handkerchief
in your back left pocket,

35:18.579 --> 35:20.543
that means
that you're into water sports.

35:21.443 --> 35:23.243
Golden showers.

35:24.910 --> 35:26.610
It means
you like getting pissed on--

35:26.645 --> 35:27.810
Yeah, I know what it means!

35:27.845 --> 35:29.160
Are you okay, man?

35:29.195 --> 35:30.435
You know what?

35:30.470 --> 35:31.640
I'm not gay,

35:31.675 --> 35:33.240
and, really,
I'm not into getting pissed on.

35:33.275 --> 35:35.075
Well, why do you have
the yellow handkerchief, then?

35:35.110 --> 35:36.474
Actually,

35:36.509 --> 35:39.040
the yellow handkerchief
means he's a chubby chaser.

35:39.075 --> 35:40.608
No, no. No, that's
a green handkerchief.

35:40.643 --> 35:42.341
No, green's
for bondage.

35:42.376 --> 35:43.339
No, that's purple.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.107
You mean you're not
into fat guys?

35:45.142 --> 35:46.140
No! Jesus!

35:46.175 --> 35:47.104
No!

35:47.139 --> 35:49.507
Okay, you know what?
I'm going home.

35:49.542 --> 35:50.974
Hey, Sean,
what're you doin'?

35:51.009 --> 35:52.406
I'm going home. Good luck, okay?

35:52.441 --> 35:54.073
Sean!

36:04.072 --> 36:05.771
Hi.

36:05.806 --> 36:07.204
We can't come
to the phone now,

36:07.239 --> 36:09.303
so leave a message.

36:09.338 --> 36:11.004
Now, what button
do I press here?

36:11.039 --> 36:12.303
Martha!

36:12.338 --> 36:13.671
What goddamn button--

36:14.938 --> 36:16.036
Aw, Dad, where are you?

36:16.071 --> 36:17.068
Huh?

36:17.103 --> 36:20.003
It's 2:40.

36:20.038 --> 36:22.402
Dad?

36:22.437 --> 36:24.136
All right,
I'll call you later, all right?

36:33.135 --> 36:34.400
Excuse me.

36:34.435 --> 36:35.635
Greg Kelly on today?

36:35.670 --> 36:36.952
I'm Greg Kelly.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.235
Can I help you?

36:38.270 --> 36:39.552
Yeah. Hi.

36:39.587 --> 36:40.835
I'm, uh...

36:42.902 --> 36:44.868
I'm Ken Shea.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.799
Oh, shit.

36:46.834 --> 36:48.434
I thought
you were gonna pop me one

36:48.469 --> 36:49.534
for a minute there.

36:49.569 --> 36:51.534
No.

36:52.767 --> 36:54.766
I mean,
I thought about it,

36:54.801 --> 36:56.264
but no.

36:56.299 --> 36:58.099
That's not
what I wanted.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.733
What I... wanted...

37:02.832 --> 37:04.799
I don't know
what I want.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.765
I'm married too,
you know.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.330
Six kids.

37:09.365 --> 37:11.432
No wonder you want
to get out of the house.

37:11.467 --> 37:13.232
No kidding.

37:13.267 --> 37:14.962
So, um...

37:14.997 --> 37:17.247
how did it start?

37:17.282 --> 37:19.463
I don't know.

37:19.498 --> 37:21.030
I was coming
out of church,

37:21.065 --> 37:22.228
and I just saw her.

37:22.263 --> 37:23.613
She dropped her bulletin.

37:23.648 --> 37:24.929
I picked it up for her.

37:24.964 --> 37:27.196
We were both feeling all good
from Mass.

37:27.231 --> 37:28.829
Mm-hm.

37:28.864 --> 37:30.363
I don't know
how it got started.

37:32.963 --> 37:35.028
So is it, um...

37:37.562 --> 37:40.329
I mean, you know,
how many times, you know...

37:40.364 --> 37:41.479
have you--

37:41.514 --> 37:42.560
Had sex?

37:42.595 --> 37:45.027
Not that many times.

37:45.062 --> 37:47.293
Six? Eight?

37:47.328 --> 37:50.894
It's not really
about the sex.

37:54.293 --> 37:55.460
What is it about?

37:57.293 --> 37:59.559
I don't know.

37:59.594 --> 38:01.791
Phyllis is funny.

38:01.826 --> 38:03.960
All she really wants to do
is sit together

38:03.995 --> 38:05.326
and drink wine and eat cookies

38:05.361 --> 38:06.558
and watch reruns

38:06.593 --> 38:08.493
of Mary Tyler Moore
and Andy Griffith.

38:10.191 --> 38:12.658
She likes to snuggle
best of all.

38:17.892 --> 38:19.656
Ken?

38:19.691 --> 38:22.657
You okay?

38:32.056 --> 38:33.206
Shit!

38:33.241 --> 38:34.321
Hey!

38:34.356 --> 38:35.923
Is there anybody out there?

38:35.958 --> 38:37.340
Help me in here!

38:37.375 --> 38:38.687
Hello?

38:38.722 --> 38:40.622
What the hell did you do?

38:40.657 --> 38:42.389
What's wrong, chief?

38:42.424 --> 38:44.086
You know what's wrong!

38:44.121 --> 38:46.871
My ass is stuck
to the toilet seat in here!

38:46.906 --> 38:49.621
Oh, it must be the glue
I put on there, huh?

38:49.656 --> 38:51.287
Get in here now and help me!

38:51.322 --> 38:52.319
That's an order!

38:52.354 --> 38:53.920
How am I supposed to do that?

38:53.955 --> 38:55.537
The door's locked
from your side.

38:55.572 --> 38:57.084
Get downstairs and get the guys

38:57.119 --> 38:58.720
and have them
knock the goddamn door down.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.137
Okay. Be right back.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.485
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

39:01.520 --> 39:04.220
Jeez, it stinks like somethin'
died up my ass in here.

39:04.255 --> 39:06.619
The switch
just outside the door.

39:06.654 --> 39:08.118
Turn it on before you go.

39:08.153 --> 39:10.919
You got it, chief.

39:12.052 --> 39:13.853
I'll find the guys
as soon as I can.

39:13.888 --> 39:15.151
See you later.

39:24.351 --> 39:26.084
Oh.

39:26.119 --> 39:27.551
Jesus!

39:27.586 --> 39:29.418
Bitch!

39:29.453 --> 39:31.250
Hey, Dad?

39:33.350 --> 39:34.983
Hey, Dad?

39:35.018 --> 39:36.650
Jesus Christ!

39:36.685 --> 39:38.282
Dad! Dad!

39:38.317 --> 39:39.247
Hey!

39:39.282 --> 39:40.349
Hey, you okay? Hey.

39:40.384 --> 39:41.600
Hey, Tom.

39:41.635 --> 39:42.808
What's up?

39:42.843 --> 39:43.946
What happened?

39:43.981 --> 39:45.548
I fell. It's okay.
It's nothing.

39:45.583 --> 39:46.680
When? Jesus Christ!

39:46.715 --> 39:48.114
Come here.
Let me help you up.

39:48.149 --> 39:49.880
Come on. Okay.

39:49.915 --> 39:51.148
Grab the counter.
Grab the counter.

39:51.183 --> 39:52.945
Got it?

39:52.980 --> 39:54.147
Jesus Christ.

39:54.182 --> 39:55.314
Here.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.447
I'm okay.

39:58.614 --> 39:59.863
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.113
Come here. Sit down.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.511
Sit down.

40:02.546 --> 40:04.362
I'm fine. I'm okay.

40:04.397 --> 40:06.179
Nothing's broken.

40:06.214 --> 40:07.713
Shit.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.043
What's this?

40:12.078 --> 40:13.211
What's it look like?

40:13.246 --> 40:14.445
It looks like a joint.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.663
Then that's what it is.

40:15.698 --> 40:16.871
You're smokin' pot again?

40:16.906 --> 40:18.175
I got it at Teddy's place.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.410
I had some shit left over,

40:19.445 --> 40:21.476
and I didn't want it
to go to waste.

40:21.511 --> 40:23.511
So you were high.
That's why you fell down.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.578
I'm using it
for medicinal purposes.

40:25.613 --> 40:26.778
What medicinal purposes?

40:26.813 --> 40:27.743
My glaucoma.

40:27.778 --> 40:29.176
You don't have glaucoma.

40:29.211 --> 40:31.210
Well, what do you think
is keeping it at bay?

40:31.245 --> 40:32.643
I'm packing up
some clothes for you,

40:32.678 --> 40:33.844
and you're moving into my house.

40:33.879 --> 40:34.809
No, no!

40:34.844 --> 40:36.143
Yes, you are,
goddamn it!

40:39.877 --> 40:41.676
You touch that joint,
you son of a bitch--

40:41.711 --> 40:42.940
Give me that.

40:42.975 --> 40:45.476
It's like dealing
with a goddamn 14-year-old!

40:45.511 --> 40:47.275
Shit!

40:51.775 --> 40:52.939
Hey!

40:52.974 --> 40:54.840
Well, look who's here!

40:54.875 --> 40:56.775
You're just in time.
We're making paella.

40:56.810 --> 40:58.006
You got mussels?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.841
Oh, sure, mussels,
shrimp, lobster,

40:59.876 --> 41:00.924
the whole nine yards.

41:00.959 --> 41:01.973
Did you give him pot?

41:02.008 --> 41:03.439
Recently?

41:03.474 --> 41:04.539
Uh-huh.

41:04.574 --> 41:06.174
What's with the dwarf?

41:06.209 --> 41:07.774
I'm not
a goddamn dwarf,

41:07.809 --> 41:08.771
you prick.

41:08.806 --> 41:10.439
Ixnay on the
orfdway talk.

41:10.474 --> 41:12.271
Arlo's had a couple.

41:12.306 --> 41:13.805
Little guy
gets some booze in him,

41:13.840 --> 41:16.072
all of a sudden,
he's got the strength of 10 men.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.872
We did great
at the O.T.B. today.

41:17.907 --> 41:19.370
2600, baby.

41:19.405 --> 41:20.904
- Your share's up on your dresser.
- Great.

41:20.939 --> 41:23.338
Dad's gonna be bunking with us
for the next couple of weeks,

41:23.373 --> 41:24.705
so let's shift things around.

41:24.740 --> 41:25.870
Sure, fine.

41:25.905 --> 41:27.904
Hey, uh, where's the dog?

41:27.939 --> 41:29.135
Uh, yeah,

41:29.170 --> 41:30.370
about the dog..

41:30.405 --> 41:31.571
Your dog's dead.

41:33.471 --> 41:35.935
I gotta take a leak.

41:35.970 --> 41:38.069
Did he just say the dog's dead?

41:38.104 --> 41:39.101
It's not my fault.

41:39.136 --> 41:40.501
I took him out for a walk,

41:40.536 --> 41:42.937
and he ran down the street
and got hit by a car.

41:42.972 --> 41:44.387
You didn't have him
on the leash?

41:44.422 --> 41:45.768
I thought he was on the leash.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.802
What do you mean? You "thought"
he was on the leash?

41:48.837 --> 41:50.569
I haven't seen my feet
in 25 years.

41:50.604 --> 41:51.734
I'm supposed to see a leash?

41:51.769 --> 41:54.635
I ask you to do one thing,
one goddamn thing.

41:54.670 --> 41:55.800
I'll buy you a new dog.

41:55.835 --> 41:57.701
I don't want another dog!
I want my dog!

41:57.736 --> 41:59.568
It's not your dog.
It's your kids' dog.

41:59.603 --> 42:01.368
Shut up!

42:01.403 --> 42:03.134
Asshole.

42:06.166 --> 42:09.765
Well...

42:09.800 --> 42:11.333
see you tomorrow.

43:06.116 --> 43:09.616
