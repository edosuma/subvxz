WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.038
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:04.072 --> 00:08.509
Whenever a slayer turns 18,
it's a time-honored
rite of passage.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.743
It's an archaic exercise
in cruelty.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.380
GILES: We're finished.
TRAVERS: Not quite.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.582
She passed.
You didn't.

00:14.615 --> 00:19.018
I've recommended to the Council
you be relieved of your duties
as Watcher immediately.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.321
You're fired.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.655
The Council's orders
are to concentrate on--

00:22.690 --> 00:25.059
I don't think I'm going to be
taking any more orders.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.829
Wesley, go back to your Council
and tell them, until the next
slayer comes along,

00:28.861 --> 00:30.431
I'm not working
for them anymore.

00:30.463 --> 00:33.234
What about the Key?
They all over it?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.735
-Well, they're interested.
-But they didn't guess
about Dawn, right?

00:35.768 --> 00:37.505
I mean, they don't know
that it's her?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.871
GILES: No.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.911
BUFFY:
Here. I'll get that.
Sorry.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.947
Mom's still not 100%,

00:47.046 --> 00:49.216
and I guess I
haven't really been
taking up the slack.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.485
-No, the place
looks fine, Buffy.
-TARA: Yeah, it's just us.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.457
That must've
belonged to, uh--

00:58.959 --> 01:00.761
Um, aren't we supposed
to have a meeting?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.698
Uh, yes, yes.
We're here for a reason.

01:05.733 --> 01:10.271
Um, I've had some rather--
um, I've had some news.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.640
It seems that
the Council of Watchers

01:12.673 --> 01:14.608
has found some
information

01:14.641 --> 01:16.243
that may help us out.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.778
About Glory?
GILES: Presumably.

01:18.811 --> 01:21.614
We'll find that out when
they arrive. Could be
very important.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.418
Arrive?
They're coming here?

01:24.451 --> 01:26.620
Now? W-w-why do they
have to come here?

01:26.653 --> 01:28.489
Yeah, don't they have phones?

01:28.521 --> 01:31.125
(British accent)
'Allo, Buffy. Here's some stuff
we know. Pip pip.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.561
Yeah! Phones.
See, I'd like them on phones.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.430
Well, what's so bad
about them coming here?
Aren't they good guys?

01:36.463 --> 01:39.432
I mean, Watchers.
That's just like
other Gileses, right?

01:39.466 --> 01:41.468
Yeah! They're scary
and horrible!

01:41.502 --> 01:45.272
Um, well, they can
appear a bit, well,

01:45.305 --> 01:48.308
um, hard-nosed,
but essentially their agenda
is the same as ours.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.978
They want to save
the world and kill demons.

01:51.010 --> 01:55.248
Kill the current demons, right?
 Current demons.

01:55.283 --> 01:59.353
Giles, I don't want them to
come here. I don't trust them.
Make them not come here.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.421
Well, they're probably
already on their way.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.426
Our old friend
Quentin Travers is
heading up the delegation.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.694
They put me through that test
and almost killed me.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.663
And then when I was Faith,
they almost killed me again.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.032
Honestly, I really can't
handle almost being
killed right now.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.968
I don't like
the sound of this.
They don't sound

02:16.002 --> 02:18.171
very ex-demon compatible.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.473
Are you sure
they're English?

02:19.507 --> 02:22.141
I thought English people
were, uh, gentler...

02:22.175 --> 02:24.044
than normal people.

02:24.076 --> 02:26.280
Maybe it won't be
so bad this time.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.782
I mean, Buffy,
they did think you
were Faith last time.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.850
Now that they know
you're just you,

02:30.884 --> 02:32.686
maybe they won't
care enough
to kill you.

02:32.719 --> 02:36.189
It's not just that.
They're going to screw
everything up.

02:36.223 --> 02:40.026
It's a delicate time right now.
I have to take care of Dawn--

02:40.060 --> 02:42.962
But that's not new.
You've always
taken care of her.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.300
Right. Right. I know that.

02:46.334 --> 02:50.037
It's just there's Glory, and I
don't need the Council looking
over my shoulder

02:50.069 --> 02:51.972
when I don't even know
what we're dealing with.

02:52.004 --> 02:54.908
GILES: Well, that's
precisely why we need
to talk to them.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.877
Dawn, honey, what are you
doing up at this hour?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.046
Go back to bed.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.151
-DAWN: I was
just getting a snack.
-Dawn? Are you listening?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.387
I can get a snack
if I want to.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.525
She was listening.
WILLOW: Does it matter?

03:11.558 --> 03:14.927
I mean, is she really gonna
set the junior
high school buzzing

03:14.961 --> 03:17.830
with, "Ooh, there's
a delegation a-comin'."

03:17.865 --> 03:19.667
No. I-I guess not.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.769
You know, it's just,

03:21.801 --> 03:26.038
sometimes we say stuff
and-- and-- it's all good.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.509
Giles, you were saying...
something?

03:28.542 --> 03:32.913
Um, just that if the Council
knows something about Glory,

03:32.945 --> 03:35.248
her agenda or her origins,

03:35.283 --> 03:37.884
then-- then maybe it will
help us...

03:37.918 --> 03:41.588
get a grip
on what we're dealing with.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.258
I mean, right now,
I think we're a bit lost.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.802
Mistress, at last
we've found one!

03:55.836 --> 03:59.539
Oh, god! Please don't hurt me!
I beg of you!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.709
If you just let me go,
I swear. I won't
tell anyone!

04:01.741 --> 04:05.211
-Help her!
-We're here for you, Great One.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.480
(moans)

04:10.651 --> 04:13.420
-What--
-Drink.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.788
Oh, what is this?

04:15.823 --> 04:18.992
What the-- what the hell
are you things doing to me?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.595
Aah!

04:26.165 --> 04:28.336
Ahh!

04:33.307 --> 04:36.276
Ah, very good.
Delicious.

04:36.310 --> 04:40.447
No. I'm good.
It's okay.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.449
Ugh!

04:45.386 --> 04:47.754
I know you're all
always lookin' at me.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.191
I can tell.
Always tell.
I can see.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.461
My hat.

04:54.495 --> 04:59.199
My hat.
Where is my hat?
GLORY: Ahh!

04:59.231 --> 05:03.336
(chuckles)
Try not cutting things
so close next time.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.005
-Understood?
-Yes. We live to serve.

05:06.038 --> 05:09.009
As always.
GLORY: Cool.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.379
Take this mess out
with the rest of the trash.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.382
And you...

05:15.516 --> 05:17.518
have something
to tell me?

05:17.550 --> 05:20.521
Indeed, Glorificus.
And I'm waiting.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.790
We have found that the signs
of the alignment

05:23.824 --> 05:26.694
are moving
faster than expected.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.963
Meaning?
If you are to use the Key,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.165
you must act quickly.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.401
Fine.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.538
I have been
cooling my heels

05:37.571 --> 05:39.540
in this crappy
little town
long enough.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.810
Sunnydale's got
too many demons

05:43.843 --> 05:46.045
and not enough
retail outlets.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.314
All you need is the Key.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.218
Yes, and I bet
Mousy the vampire slayer
has an idea where it is.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.254
If I may remind
Your Eminence,

05:54.286 --> 05:56.423
you don't have
much time.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.827
Oh, baby, if that girl's
the only thing between me
and my Key,

06:00.860 --> 06:03.764
I don't need much time.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.468
(theme music playing)

07:00.821 --> 07:01.788
GILES: If you're--

07:01.822 --> 07:04.156
if you're serious
about this, madam,

07:04.190 --> 07:06.225
you need to be
very careful.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.261
Measure precisely, and please,
don't step ahead.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.596
No, he's quite right.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.567
You wouldn't want
to do anything dangerous,

07:14.601 --> 07:17.471
turn the wrong person
into a badger.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.673
(chuckling)
Quentin.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.440
I didn't realize
you were here.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.209
Well, evidently.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.846
-It's been a while.
-Mmm.

07:26.879 --> 07:30.850
I see you've brought some
of our colleagues with you.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.286
Would you care
to introduce us?

07:33.319 --> 07:36.689
First, I thought
we might catch up.

07:36.723 --> 07:40.159
Well, certainly, certainly.
Well, um...

07:40.192 --> 07:42.762
this is the shop,
obviously.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.598
It's been a very
interesting transition

07:44.632 --> 07:46.266
into the world of retail.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.268
In fact, I think
it's going rather well.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.103
I'll give you a grand tour,
if you like.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.404
No, that's all right.
I think I can see
what you've been up to.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.942
GILES:
Yes, well, I-- I, uh, do

07:55.975 --> 07:58.778
limit my time here, obviously.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.514
Buffy and I have been training
a great deal these days.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.884
-There's a back room--
-Oh, yes. I thought perhaps
you were keeping that space

08:04.918 --> 08:07.286
for the really
dangerous items that
should be kept out

08:07.319 --> 08:08.855
of the public's
hands.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.560
Or maybe you don't
worry about that.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.627
I'm very careful.

08:14.661 --> 08:19.298
Most of this stuff
couldn't harm anyone--
incense, dime-store trinkets.

08:19.331 --> 08:22.168
-But there are some things.
-I'm sorry. Who are you?

08:22.201 --> 08:24.303
WOMAN: There are some
very potent elements here--

08:24.336 --> 08:25.639
focusing crystals,

08:25.673 --> 08:29.375
runic artifacts,
an Amulet of Coldis.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.478
Also this statue.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.745
Its removal from Burma

08:32.779 --> 08:35.514
is a criminal offense,
and when triggered,

08:35.548 --> 08:37.985
has the power to melt
human eyeballs.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.421
In that case,
I severely underpriced it.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.557
Giles, I'm sorry,

08:43.591 --> 08:46.225
but this is just
for the duration
of our stay.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.662
I think you can
see why.
What?

08:48.696 --> 08:51.331
What-- what-- what is
just for the duration?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.100
Magic Box shoppers,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.101
we're going to have
to ask you to leave.

08:55.134 --> 08:58.171
The store is, uh,
closing early today.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.107
Terribly sorry
for the inconvenience.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.211
Hey! Giles,
what are they doing?

09:04.244 --> 09:08.181
Customers!
Please bring
your money back!

09:08.215 --> 09:10.049
Right this way.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.785
You knew you
were going to do this
before you even saw the place.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.956
I'm sorry. It's just
for the duration
of the Council's review.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.793
Council? You're the Council?

09:19.826 --> 09:23.630
Welcome to our store.
We're closed now.
I'll be in the back.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.434
What review? Quentin,
let's just stop a moment
and talk about this.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.738
Miss, excuse me.
You, uh-- you work here?

09:30.770 --> 09:33.941
Yes, I do,

09:33.974 --> 09:36.744
ever since I moved here
from southeastern Indiana,

09:36.777 --> 09:38.812
where I was raised by both
a mother and a father.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.313
Anya, just go.
You don't have
to talk to him.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.350
She works for me.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.286
Now, tell me
about this review.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.254
No one said anything to me
about this.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.758
Let's sit down
and talk about it
over here.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.336
You all stand around
and look somber.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.774
Good job.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.577
You used to respect us,
Giles. You used to be
one of us.

10:11.610 --> 10:15.682
You used to pay me.
If you recall,
firing me was not my idea.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.116
Touché.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.452
But you were
on the inside once.

10:20.486 --> 10:24.291
You know what sort
of resources we command.

10:24.323 --> 10:28.495
We've discovered information
about this creature,
your Glory.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.530
Some of it is
clearly vital,

10:31.563 --> 10:34.400
the rest merely
extremely disturbing.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.838
And it won't be handed over
until we are convinced

10:38.871 --> 10:41.274
that you and your slayer
are prepared for it.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.210
Thus the review.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.778
I'm not having you
put her through another
one of your insane tests.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.049
It's not a test.
It's a check
of her methods.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.686
We need to know that
this information
is safe.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.822
You can trust her.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.359
Buffy's come
very far recently.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.628
She's acquired
a remarkable focus.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.563
(yawning)
MAN: Now, Rasputin
was associated

11:04.596 --> 11:07.299
with a certain obscure
religious sect.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.136
They held the tenet that
in order to be forgiven,

11:10.169 --> 11:11.871
one first had to sin.

11:11.971 --> 11:14.240
Rasputin embraced
this doctrine

11:14.274 --> 11:17.644
and proceeded to sin
impressively and repeatedly.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.379
The notion that he was,
in fact, evil,

11:20.413 --> 11:24.017
gained strength years later,
when the conspirators
who set out to kill him

11:24.051 --> 11:26.886
found it nearly impossible
to do so.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.355
-Nearly impossible?
-I'm sorry. There was
a question?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.427
Miss Summers, of course.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.703
I, uh--
about, you know,
killing him--

11:44.738 --> 11:47.240
you know, they poisoned him
and they beat him

11:47.274 --> 11:51.244
and they shot him
and he didn't die.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.081
Until they rolled his body
in a carpet and drowned him
in a canal.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.250
But there are reported sightings
of him as late as the 1930s,
aren't there?

11:58.284 --> 12:00.854
I can assure you,
there is near-consensus

12:00.888 --> 12:03.123
in the academic
community regarding
the death of Rasputin.

12:03.155 --> 12:06.092
There's also near-consensus
about Columbus, you know,

12:06.125 --> 12:09.261
until someone asked
the Vikings what they were
up to in the 1400s,

12:09.296 --> 12:12.298
and they're
like, "Discovering this
America-shaped continent."

12:12.331 --> 12:14.902
(students snickering)
I just--

12:14.934 --> 12:17.736
I'm only saying, you know,
it might be interesting...

12:17.770 --> 12:20.206
if we came at it...

12:20.240 --> 12:22.975
from, you know, a different
perspective, that's all.

12:23.009 --> 12:27.147
Well, I'm sorry
if you find these facts
so boring, Miss Summers.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.649
Maybe you'd prefer
I step aside

12:29.682 --> 12:31.650
so that you can teach
your own course--

12:31.683 --> 12:34.855
Speculation 101,
perhaps?
(class laughs)

12:34.955 --> 12:38.057
Intro to Flights of Fancy?

12:38.091 --> 12:41.061
I only meant--
MAN: What was it you were
going on about last week?

12:41.094 --> 12:44.530
The mysterious sleeping patterns
of the Prussian generals?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.567
Now, some of us
are here to learn.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.239
Believe it or not, we're
interested in finding out
what actually happened.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.109
It's called
studying history.

12:56.143 --> 13:00.647
You can sit down now.
Unless you have something else
to add, Professor?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.086
BUFFY:
Miss Summers!
(grunts)

13:06.119 --> 13:07.988
Some of us are here
to learn, Professor!

13:15.495 --> 13:17.163
(Buffy yelling)

13:17.264 --> 13:19.265
Maybe you would like
to teach your own class.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.369
-Who are you talking to?
-Ooh!

13:25.572 --> 13:27.474
Hyah!

13:33.980 --> 13:37.183
Spike,
why did you do that?

13:37.216 --> 13:39.852
Not for money, if that's
what you're thinkin'.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.322
Your heartfelt
gratitude's plenty.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.390
I expect I'll be
getting that any moment.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.960
Gratitude?
For getting in my way?

13:46.994 --> 13:49.395
G-getting in your way?
I saved you.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.899
I was regrouping.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.668
You were about to be
regrouped into separate piles.
You needed help.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.705
I didn't need you.
I never need you, Spike.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.308
Oh, I get it.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.543
You just don't like
who did the rescuing,
that's all.

14:04.576 --> 14:07.813
Wishin' I was your
boyfriend what's his--
oh, wait. He's run off.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.350
You know what? I don't need
a boyfriend-- to rescue me
or for any other reason.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.552
Don't need
or can't keep?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.054
You keep making notches in
the headboard, but eventually
they get out of bed

14:15.087 --> 14:16.556
and run off,
don't they?

14:18.057 --> 14:21.528
You're disgusting.
Oh, rough talk.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.898
Maybe that's your problem.
Maybe you push them away.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.667
Or is it the other?
Maybe you cling
too much.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.503
Or maybe
your beauty's fading,

14:30.537 --> 14:32.838
the stress of slaying
aging you prematurely--

14:32.871 --> 14:36.342
things not as high,
not as firm.
You know what, Spike?

14:36.375 --> 14:40.246
The more I get to know you,
the more I wish I didn't.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.282
Or maybe you just don't
hold their interest.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.926
(woman speaking
over P.A., indistinct)

14:55.095 --> 14:58.230
Begging permission
to speak with you, sir.

14:58.264 --> 15:01.134
Don't touch me.
You're crusty.
What do you want?

15:01.168 --> 15:03.937
Oh, not me.
The Magnificent Glory.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.139
She wants.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.307
She wants
more information
on the slayer.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.476
She knows you know her.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.245
The slayer?
I don't know any slayer.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.383
Get away from me.
You shouldn't be here.
I believe you do, sir.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.786
She's short, symmetrical,
hair on top.
Buffy something.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.588
Buffy Summers is the slayer?
That's the one!

15:22.688 --> 15:24.624
Very clever
of you, sir.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.826
The slayer?
How does Glory know this?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.129
I don't know.
I was not there.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.299
But the Beauteous Glory
said for you to tell us please

15:33.332 --> 15:37.836
where her dwelling is,
who her friends are.

15:37.870 --> 15:42.142
Why? So Glory can find her,
do something to her?

15:42.174 --> 15:45.177
Why would I do that?
I don't know, sir.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.947
She just said
to tell you to do it.
For her.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.451
That was her message.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.620
Well, I've got a message
for Glory too.

15:54.653 --> 15:58.490
We've been developing
a sort of a hybrid
fighting style.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.427
Let me outline
her progress for you,

16:00.460 --> 16:03.962
and I think you'll
see that your review
isn't strictly needed.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.669
-BUFFY: Bad day.
Bad, bad, bad day.
-TRAVERS: Miss Summers.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.972
Good to see you again.

16:18.177 --> 16:22.282
-Mr. Travers.
-Giles has just been telling us
of your training regimen.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.917
Perhaps you'll favor us
with a demonstration
while we're here.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.022
-Right now?
-No need to rush you.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.158
They're staying
a little longer than
I'd anticipated.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.294
We've already laid out
our project for Mr. Giles.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.030
Nigel.
It's an exhaustive
examination

16:38.065 --> 16:40.500
of your procedures
and abilities.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.570
-We'll observe your training,
talk to your friends.
-Talk to my friends?

16:43.602 --> 16:47.874
Yes. We understand you're
still taking civilians
out on your patrols.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.309
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.
TRAVERS: Buffy.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.080
I can sense your resistance.
I don't blame you.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.749
But I think your Watcher
hasn't reminded you lately

16:56.783 --> 17:00.352
of the relative
status of the players
in our little game.

17:00.386 --> 17:04.324
The Council fights evil.
The slayer is the instrument
by which we fight.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.826
The Council remains.
The slayers change.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.560
Been that way
from the beginning.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.065
That's a very comforting,
bloodless way of looking
at it, isn't it?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.401
Giles, let me talk to Buffy,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.769
because I think
she's understanding me.

17:16.803 --> 17:22.442
Glory is stronger than you.
She's a more powerful
instrument, if you will.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.911
We can help you.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.445
We have information
that will help.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.116
Pass the review,
and we give it to you
without reservation.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.854
Fail the review,
either through
incompetence

17:34.886 --> 17:36.855
or by resisting
our recommendations--

17:36.888 --> 17:38.590
Resisting your
recommendations?

17:38.625 --> 17:41.693
She fails if we don't
do whatever you say.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.298
How much under your thumb
do you think we are?
How much do you want our help?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.967
She's not your bloody
instrument, and you have
no right to do any of this!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.736
Giles!

17:54.073 --> 17:56.608
TRAVERS:
I understand
you think this is unfair,

17:56.643 --> 17:59.979
but there are factors
which should motivate you
to go along with the review.

18:00.011 --> 18:03.450
I don't want
to do this,

18:03.482 --> 18:06.618
but obviously we could
shut this place down
permanently.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.256
You can't do that.
You don't have
that kind of power.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.624
Of course we do,
and a great deal more.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.660
In fact, if you insist
on fighting us,

18:13.692 --> 18:16.229
we'll arrange to have
Mr. Giles deported
within the day.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.232
Never set foot
in this country again.

18:20.267 --> 18:25.003
Now, perhaps you're used
to idle threats and sloppy
discipline, Miss Summers,

18:25.037 --> 18:26.638
but you're dealing
with grown-ups now.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.377
Am I making myself clear?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.161
GLORY:
Jinx!

18:48.194 --> 18:51.130
Hey, what's the deal
with your face?

18:51.163 --> 18:54.032
It's a message from Ben.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.036
He isn't going to help.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.405
Isn't going--

19:00.707 --> 19:04.109
-Isn't going to help?
-No.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.945
All he has to do
is turn over that tiny,
squirming slayer girl.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.316
I have business
to do with her.

19:09.348 --> 19:13.220
If she knows where
I can start looking
for my Key-- ah!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.794
Why won't he help?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.029
He knows her.
He could go to her.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.999
He could talk to her.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.167
He could seduce her
and bang the Key
out of her!

19:29.201 --> 19:32.271
-He is quite attractive.
-Well, of course
he's attractive,

19:33.905 --> 19:36.909
but he drives me insane.

19:36.942 --> 19:40.380
-You know what I mean?
-He drives you insane?

19:40.413 --> 19:43.282
Yeah!
That's it, exactly.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.286
Oh--

19:48.788 --> 19:51.923
Mmm.
Sweet, lumpy minion.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.728
You're the only one
that understands.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.232
Probably because I haven't
sucked your brain out yet.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.571
He makes me so mad.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.909
If I could just...
get my hands on him.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.511
You know?

20:12.545 --> 20:15.013
(huffs)
I'll just find her myself.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.849
It's a power play.
That's what it is.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.219
It's about who
has the power.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.188
I'm guessing they do.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.291
Big power outage
in Buffy county.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.294
I should have set you loose
on them. That's what
I should have done.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.398
Giles, that Travers guy
is, like, 60.
I can't hit him.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.934
Can I?

20:35.968 --> 20:38.337
I suppose not.
But I could.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.807
I think I will.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.315
Can they really do
the stuff they threatened--
kick you out of the country?

20:48.347 --> 20:49.682
In a heartbeat.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.286
See, the rough stuff,
they're all right at--

20:53.319 --> 20:56.388
they're a bit ham-handed,
but they get it done--
but this stuff,

20:56.423 --> 21:00.393
the bureaucracy,
the pulling
of political strings,

21:00.426 --> 21:02.060
they're the best
in the world.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.762
They can kill you
with the stroke of a pen,

21:03.796 --> 21:06.432
poncy sods.
(glasses snap)

21:08.166 --> 21:10.803
Am I gonna be able to
get through this review?

21:12.971 --> 21:15.607
Well, I--

21:15.642 --> 21:18.009
I suppose they'll
make it as difficult
as they want to.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.781
The physical stuff
could be a bit
of a challenge.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.717
That's not what
I'm worried about.

21:25.684 --> 21:26.818
It's the other stuff.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.823
Examining decisions
I've made.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.625
I mean, twice now
I've been within
slaying distance of Glory,

21:33.660 --> 21:37.564
and twice she's kicked my ass
without even tensing a muscle.

21:37.663 --> 21:41.433
And I haven't been able
to figure out what she is
or anything about her

21:41.468 --> 21:43.470
except that
she wants the Key,
which I have,

21:43.502 --> 21:45.938
and I can't even figure out
if it's okay for me
to tell anyone that.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.106
Buffy, no one could have
done any better than you.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.009
But no one else is gonna
be asked the questions
that I can't answer.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.513
They're gonna expect me to--

21:54.547 --> 21:56.848
to be like a slayer
and know stuff,

21:56.883 --> 21:59.385
but I'm just me,
and I don't know anything,

21:59.419 --> 22:01.988
and they're gonna go away,
and they're not gonna tell me
how to fight Glory,

22:02.020 --> 22:04.022
and I'm not gonna be able
to protect Dawn.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.726
Buffy, calm down.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.628
The scandal here
is not anything
you've done wrong.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.832
It's the way they're
behaving, holding what
they know hostage

22:12.865 --> 22:16.969
with a gun pointed
at my bleeding green card,
no less.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.506
(sighs)
It's humiliating.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.843
Also smart.

22:23.875 --> 22:27.513
They picked the perfect thing.
I can't lose you.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.416
Thank you.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.753
(sighs)
I guess I should be
getting ready.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.557
What do you think
it'll be like?

22:37.589 --> 22:39.692
How do you
think they'll start?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.193
Anya Christina
Emanuella Jenkins,

22:42.228 --> 22:45.064
20 years old, born
on the Fourth of July,

22:45.096 --> 22:48.401
and don't think there weren't
jokes about that my whole life,
mister, 'cause there were.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.936
"Who's our little patriot?"
they'd say, when I was younger

22:50.970 --> 22:53.506
and, therefore, smaller
and shorter than I am now.

22:53.539 --> 22:58.744
So, you spell it
A-N-Y-A, then?

22:58.778 --> 23:02.213
Yes.
Fine.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.416
Now we can get
to the questions.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.553
Questions. Great.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.119
W-we can
answer questions.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.624
Well, I need to know
a little bit more
about the slayer...

23:11.657 --> 23:13.726
and about the both of you--

23:13.759 --> 23:15.627
your relationship,
whatever you can tell me.

23:15.662 --> 23:18.631
Our-- our relationship?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.900
We're friends.
Good friends.

23:22.934 --> 23:26.238
Girlfriends, actually.
Yes, we're girlfriends.

23:26.271 --> 23:29.875
We're in love.
We're lovers.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.779
We're lesbian,
gay-type lovers.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.615
I meant your relationship
with the slayer.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.951
Um...

23:38.984 --> 23:41.153
Just good friends.

23:41.186 --> 23:44.123
XANDER:
Best friends-- Willow
and me and Buffy.

23:44.155 --> 23:46.726
The three of us
have been together
from the beginning.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.462
We've always gone on patrols
and done demon research
with her and everything.

23:50.497 --> 23:54.000
Have you mastered
any fighting disciplines
over the years?

23:54.032 --> 23:57.236
-No.
-So, you have
no special skills

23:57.269 --> 24:00.606
or powers or knowledge

24:00.640 --> 24:03.442
that you bring to the mix,
neither of you?

24:03.476 --> 24:07.513
Just enthusiasm
for killing the demons.
Go deadness for the demons.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.249
I don't have any powers,
but I do help.

24:10.281 --> 24:12.151
How? Be specific.

24:12.183 --> 24:14.487
Last year,
Willow, Giles and me

24:14.520 --> 24:18.156
combined our essence
with Buffy, which isn't
as weird as it sounds.

24:18.190 --> 24:22.294
We merged,
and I was the heart part
of a super-Buffy.

24:22.327 --> 24:25.364
Again, let me stress
the not-as-weird thing.

24:25.396 --> 24:27.599
I'm told it was all
very professional.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.001
Are you saying
that the slayer

24:30.036 --> 24:32.038
needs that level
of help from you often?

24:32.070 --> 24:35.473
-No, no. She doesn't need help.
-She'd be fine without us.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.644
Sometimes she goes off
and does stuff without
even telling us.

24:38.677 --> 24:41.513
Not that she's like
a weird loner or anything.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.214
I'm not sure we're
saying this right.

24:43.249 --> 24:47.286
See, here's the thing.
We can help
because we do magics.

24:47.318 --> 24:50.122
I'm working on this
ball of sunshine thing.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.223
See, I have this theory.
It's very cool.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.961
And if it works,
easier slaying for Buffy.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.462
Not that it's hard
for her now.
Interesting.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.299
-What level are you at?
-Level?

25:01.333 --> 25:05.070
-Magical proficiency level.
-WILLOW: Oh!

25:05.104 --> 25:07.740
Uh, high, a high level.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.743
Very high.
One of those top levels.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.913
Five.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.484
And you're registered
as practicing witches

25:19.518 --> 25:21.519
under the names
as you gave them to me?

25:21.554 --> 25:24.757
-R-registered?
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.258
We're-- we're...
Registered.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.761
Do either of you know
anything about the Key?
ANYA: Nope.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.198
Sounds demony to me.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.901
I don't hold
with that demon nonsense.
Muffin?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.868
I cooked them myself.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.040
So, Buffy sometimes
protects you

25:42.074 --> 25:45.243
from the dangerous elements
of her work?
Yes.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.847
She's saved my life
lots of times. The vampires
in this town hate her.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.450
But we understand
that you help the slayer.

25:51.482 --> 25:54.420
I pitch in
when she pays me.
WOMAN: She pays you?

25:54.452 --> 25:57.088
She gives you money?

25:57.123 --> 26:00.192
Money, a little nip
of blood out of some
stray victim, whatever.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.894
-Blood?
-Well, if they're
gonna die anyway.

26:04.896 --> 26:08.034
Come to think of it,
though, that's a bit
scandalous, isn't it?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.135
Personally, I'm shocked.
The girl's slipping.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.971
You've noticed a decline
in her work?
Oh, yeah.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.642
See, the poor little twig
can't keep a man.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.943
Gets her all down.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.780
Few more disappointments,
she'll be cryin' on my
shoulder, mark my words.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.049
Is that what you want?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.218
I'd think you'd
want to kill her.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.288
You've killed slayers
before.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.589
Heard of me, have you?

26:34.626 --> 26:36.962
I... wrote my thesis on you.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.465
Well, well.
Isn't that neat?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.567
-It's--
-Tell me, pet,

26:42.601 --> 26:46.105
now we're such good friends,
how's the slayer doing?

26:46.137 --> 26:48.641
Is she okay?

26:48.674 --> 26:50.342
High marks
in all categories?

26:50.375 --> 26:53.913
Agility, clarity,
stamina and strength--

26:53.945 --> 26:58.150
these are the qualities
that the slayer must
possess to do her job.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.987
What came after agility?
If you want her
to attack the dummy--

27:01.019 --> 27:04.022
No, no. Phillip
will attack the dummy.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.759
The slayer's job
is to protect it.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.694
Do you understand?

27:08.728 --> 27:11.830
Protect the dummy?
As if it were precious.

27:11.864 --> 27:15.701
Now, getting
the best of Phillip
will require agility.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.636
Listening to my instructions
at the same time--

27:18.671 --> 27:21.640
well, that will
demonstrate clarity,

27:21.673 --> 27:24.343
and stamina and strength
will win the long fight.

27:24.375 --> 27:27.479
Good luck.
Instructions?

27:27.512 --> 27:30.182
I'll be telling you
what to do, how to
counter Phillip's thrusts.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.318
We assume you're familiar
with the Japanese names

27:33.352 --> 27:35.788
for aikido,
jujitsu moves.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.355
Japanese?
And... go!

27:37.388 --> 27:39.025
Whoa!
Hold on a second.

27:39.057 --> 27:43.162
We in America,
we usually work
our way up to "go."

27:43.194 --> 27:46.164
(speaking Japanese)
Huh?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.534
He wants you to bow.
Take a bow.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.435
Oh.

28:04.615 --> 28:06.417
(speaking Japanese)

28:07.720 --> 28:09.888
Punch him.
Thanks, Giles.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.057
Sorry.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.026
(speaking Japanese)

28:14.059 --> 28:16.929
GILES:
Um-- back kick. Elbow.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.832
Su-- elbow!
Strike.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.534
How have you
been training her?
I've trained her to win.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.604
Know what? I'm gonna
have to do it my way, guys.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.477
Oh!

28:38.584 --> 28:40.152
(gasping)

28:42.453 --> 28:43.721
Oh.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.961
-I think she
just broke my rib.
-Yes. Well.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.962
I didn't mean to.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.631
Um, you know,
I can do better.

28:52.663 --> 28:55.101
I think I might be getting
this, like, inner ear thing,

28:55.134 --> 28:58.104
and so maybe
if I got a note,
I could try again.

28:58.136 --> 29:01.440
No. That's all right.
I don't think we need to see
any more physical tests

29:01.472 --> 29:03.075
for a while.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.911
We can move on
to the real review.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.946
Look into
your strategies, plans.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.983
Figure out what's
going on in that head.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.553
Good. Head stuff.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.755
We start
at 7:00 tonight.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.490
Give you time
to, uh...

29:20.125 --> 29:23.128
well...
however you prepare.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.615
Mom?

29:51.356 --> 29:52.959
Long day, sweetie?

30:01.968 --> 30:02.868
So...

30:04.170 --> 30:07.538
This is where the slayer
eats, sleeps,

30:07.573 --> 30:10.342
and... combs her hair?

30:10.375 --> 30:14.779
Oh. So cute.
(snickers)

30:14.813 --> 30:16.347
I can't even stand it.

30:17.548 --> 30:20.286
Personally,
I need more space.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.855
But, uh,
this is good for you.

30:22.888 --> 30:25.892
It's-- it's so quaint and--

30:25.924 --> 30:29.194
Psst! Buffy.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.397
If I wanted to fight,
you could tell
by the being dead already.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.403
(giggles)
So play nice,
little girl.

30:38.436 --> 30:41.573
What do you want?
The Key.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.976
Why else do you think
I'd come here?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.345
See, I think
you know where it is.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.415
-And that's a good thing.
-I'm glad you think so.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.019
Well, it's the only thing
keeping you alive
right now.

30:53.051 --> 30:56.055
Because you
may be tiny queen
in vampire world,

30:56.087 --> 30:59.557
but to me,
you're a bug.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.727
You should get down
on your knees
and worship me.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.394
But, oh, no.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.097
You still think it's neat
having slayer strength.
(mouthing)

31:06.132 --> 31:09.567
Ooh, big deal.
Stronger than humans.

31:10.701 --> 31:12.238
Who isn't?

31:12.270 --> 31:15.606
I could crush the life
from you as easy
as you'd break a nail,

31:15.641 --> 31:17.509
but I need the Key.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.144
Kid!

31:20.711 --> 31:22.949
-Come here a sec.
-Leave her out of this.

31:22.981 --> 31:26.184
-Not asking twice.
-This is between you and me.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.854
No. This is between me
andKey.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.957
You just happen to be
the thing in the way.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.124
(snap)

31:36.427 --> 31:41.500
And you are just
the darlin'est thing
I ever did see in my life.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.938
-What's your name, honey?
-Dawn.

31:45.971 --> 31:49.441
Dawn? Did you know your sister
took my Key, Dawnie?
And she won't give it back.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.979
-I bet you know where
she put it, don't you?
-She doesn't know anything.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.083
I know some stuff.

31:57.115 --> 32:00.618
I bet she takes your stuff
all the time without asking,
doesn't she?

32:00.652 --> 32:04.655
-Where's my Key, Dawn?
-Go upstairs, Dawn.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.292
You're always talkin'
about stuff I'm not
supposed to hear.

32:08.626 --> 32:10.028
I'm gonna figure it out,
you know.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.932
Ooh! I like her.
She's sassy!

32:18.136 --> 32:20.771
And I'll kill her.
I'll kill your mom.

32:21.772 --> 32:23.174
I'll kill your friends.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.944
And I'll make you
watch when I do.

32:28.646 --> 32:31.150
Just give me the Key.

32:31.182 --> 32:34.052
You either have it or you
know where to find it.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.358
Obviously, this
is a one-time-only deal.

32:40.392 --> 32:43.961
Next time we meet,
something you love
dies bloody.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.464
You know
you can't take me.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.700
You know
you can't stop me.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.007
(door opens, closes)

32:59.478 --> 33:00.846
Buffy, who was that?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.883
Pack a bag.

33:04.915 --> 33:07.553
(screams)

33:07.586 --> 33:11.323
(sighs)
Oh, it's the slayer.

33:11.356 --> 33:12.758
For a second there,
I was worried.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.833
So, what's with
the family outing?

33:21.866 --> 33:23.568
I need your help.

33:23.602 --> 33:27.005
Great. I need your cash.
I'm serious.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.375
You have to look after them.

33:30.409 --> 33:35.047
Well, that's a boatload
of manly responsibility
to come flying out of nowhere.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.648
What's the matter, slayer?
You're not feeling 100%?

33:37.682 --> 33:40.219
No.
They didn't put a chip
in your head, did they?

33:40.251 --> 33:42.054
No.
Be funny if they did.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.223
Spike, I need
an answer, now.
In or out?

33:47.226 --> 33:50.761
You're the only one
strong enough
to protect them.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.403
All right, then.

33:57.435 --> 34:00.705
Ladies, come on in.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.375
There's plenty of blood
in the fridge.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.577
Do you mean,
like, real blood?

34:06.612 --> 34:09.614
-What do you think?
-Mostly, I think, ew.

34:09.648 --> 34:12.083
Keep Dawn here
as long as you can.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.253
I'll be back soon.
Okay.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.126
I don't think I need to
remind you, but--
Yeah, yeah.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.628
"Anything happens to 'em,
I'll stake you
good and proper."

34:22.661 --> 34:26.063
Sing me a new one
sometime, eh?
That bit's gone stale.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.547
I love what you've, um,
neglected to do
with the place.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.016
Just don't break anything.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.489
And don't make a lot
of noise.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.724
Passions is coming on.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.295
Passions?
Oh, do you think
Timmy's really dead?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.597
Oh, no, no.
She can just sew him
back together.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.400
He's a doll,
for god's sake.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.101
JOYCE:
Ah, what about the wedding?

35:03.135 --> 35:06.505
I mean, there's no way they're
gonna go through with that.
(sighs)

35:06.538 --> 35:09.740
(sigh)

35:09.775 --> 35:13.978
XANDER: Look at them:
big, tough Council members
pickin' on the books.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.481
Fascists.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.648
Why doesn't Mr. Giles
put them all out
of here?

35:17.682 --> 35:20.152
Because if they deport him,
they're not just
destroying his career,

35:20.186 --> 35:23.355
they're
condemning the man
to a lifetime diet

35:23.389 --> 35:25.990
of blood sausage,
bangers and mash.

35:28.226 --> 35:32.463
Well, your slayer's
20 minutes late
and counting, Rupert.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.365
Buffy will be here,
I assure you.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.302
(chuckles)
Yes. But when?

35:39.905 --> 35:41.172
Crap.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.411
(Buffy gasps)

36:00.025 --> 36:02.228
Uh, guys?

36:02.260 --> 36:04.429
Any way we could
not do this?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.346
Unh!

37:04.222 --> 37:08.726
Unh!
Okay, let's see
what you are.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.898
Or wh you are.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.766
One soldier
in a vast army.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.603
What army?

37:17.635 --> 37:20.739
The Knights
of Byzantium,
an ancient order,

37:20.771 --> 37:23.309
and now your enemy.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.643
You work for Glory?
(scoffs)

37:25.677 --> 37:28.447
You think
we align ourselves
with the beast?

37:28.480 --> 37:31.650
-You must be mad.
-You're the ones
tried killin' me.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.052
Oh, we were fools--
three alone.

37:34.085 --> 37:37.155
But if it
takes a hundred men,
we send a hundred men,

37:37.188 --> 37:40.391
And if it takes a thousand,
we send a thousand.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.561
-A thousand?
-So long as you
protect the Key,

37:43.594 --> 37:45.630
the Brotherhood
will never stop

37:45.664 --> 37:48.666
until we destroy it
and you.
(groans)

37:50.369 --> 37:54.271
You are the slayer,
and we know
what we must do.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.173
Now, be done with it.

37:57.342 --> 38:00.378
Kill us,
and let legions follow.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.469
Go.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.063
You're late.
BUFFY: Yeah.

38:53.864 --> 38:56.534
GILES:
Was-- was there
an attack?

38:56.568 --> 39:00.472
-Yeah.
-TRAVERS: We can begin
the review at last.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.708
We'll skip the more
obvious questions.

39:07.244 --> 39:10.148
-There isn't gonna be
a review.
-Sorry?

39:10.181 --> 39:13.184
No review.
No interrogation.

39:13.217 --> 39:16.221
No questions
you kn I can't answer,

39:16.253 --> 39:18.523
No hoops, no jumps,

39:18.556 --> 39:19.590
and no interruptions.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.164
See...

39:26.197 --> 39:29.333
I've had a lot
of people talking at me
the last few days.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.739
Everyone just lining up
to tell me how
unimportant I am.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.208
And I've finally
figured out why.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.547
Power.

39:41.579 --> 39:44.449
I have it.
They don't.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.619
This bothers them.

39:51.255 --> 39:54.025
Glory came to my home today.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.228
-Buffy, are you--
-Just to talk.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.396
She told me I'm a bug.
I'm a flea.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.231
She could squash me
in a second.

40:03.268 --> 40:04.735
Only she didn't.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.373
She came into my home,
and we talked.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.777
We had what,
in her warped brain,

40:11.809 --> 40:13.744
probably passes
for a civilized conversation.

40:13.778 --> 40:16.280
Why?

40:16.313 --> 40:19.016
Because she needs
something from me...

40:20.251 --> 40:22.853
because I have power
over her.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.626
You guys didn't come
all the way from England

40:28.659 --> 40:31.630
to determine whether
or not I was good enough
to be let back in.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.099
You came...

40:35.132 --> 40:37.869
to beg me
to let you back in,

40:40.771 --> 40:45.010
to give your jobs, your lives,
some semblance of meaning.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.945
This is beyond insolence.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.282
(clears throat)

40:52.317 --> 40:54.786
I'm fairly certain
I said, "No interruptions."

40:56.320 --> 40:59.724
-That was excellent.
-BUFFY: You're Watchers.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.695
Without a slayer,

41:03.728 --> 41:05.963
you're pretty much just
watchin' Masterpiece Theater.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.001
You can't stop Glory.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.302
You can't do anything
with the information you have

41:12.336 --> 41:16.240
except maybe publish it in
 The Everyone Thinks We're
 Insane-os Home Journal.

41:20.878 --> 41:23.114
So here's how
it's gonna work.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.182
You're gonna tell me
everything you know,

41:25.215 --> 41:27.184
then you're gonna go away.

41:27.217 --> 41:30.521
You'll contact me if
and when you have any further
information about Glory.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.458
The Magic Shop
will remain open.

41:33.490 --> 41:36.827
Mr. Giles will stay here
as my official Watcher,
reinstated at full salary.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.797
(coughs)
Retroactive.

41:38.829 --> 41:44.570
To be paid retroactively
from the month he was fired.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.972
I will continue my work
with the help of my friends.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.407
I-- I-- I don't want
a sword thrown at me,

41:50.440 --> 41:53.545
but civilians--
we're talking about children.

41:53.579 --> 41:58.016
We're talking about
two very powerful witches

41:58.048 --> 41:59.650
and a thousand-year-old
ex-demon.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.052
Willow's a demon?

42:02.086 --> 42:05.590
The boy?
No power there.

42:05.623 --> 42:09.728
The boy has clocked
more field time than
all of you combined.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.096
He's part of the unit.

42:11.128 --> 42:14.398
That's Riley-speak.
I've clocked field time.

42:14.431 --> 42:15.900
Now...

42:17.534 --> 42:20.871
You all may be very good
at your jobs.

42:20.905 --> 42:23.875
The only way
we're gonna find out
is if you work with me.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.411
You can all take your time
thinking about that.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.682
But I want an answer
right now from Quentin,

42:31.717 --> 42:33.918
'cause I think
he's understanding me.

42:35.485 --> 42:37.454
(clears throat)

42:41.760 --> 42:45.030
Your terms are acceptable.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.199
(cheering, whooping)

42:48.233 --> 42:50.835
Sorry. Sorry.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.639
Mmm.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.275
See?
No begging.

42:58.309 --> 42:59.577
(chuckles)

43:01.112 --> 43:03.715
-Oh, Rupert.
-Quentin?

43:03.748 --> 43:05.983
When we
inventoried your shop,

43:06.016 --> 43:09.621
we found a bottle
of single-malt scotch

43:09.655 --> 43:12.489
behind the, uh,
incense holders.

43:12.523 --> 43:14.626
It's-- not, you know,
during working hours.

43:14.659 --> 43:16.894
I think I could
use a glass.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.063
Well, I suppose we could--

43:19.097 --> 43:20.465
Just a minute.

43:21.867 --> 43:25.402
Glory.
I wanna know.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.273
Well, there's a lot
to go through.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.742
Just tell me what kind
of demon I'm fighting.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.679
Well, that's the thing,
you see.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.612
Glory isn't a demon.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.516
What is she?

43:38.548 --> 43:40.851
She's a god.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.324
Oh.

44:24.262 --> 44:26.697
Grr! Arrgh!
