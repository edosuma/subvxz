02:18.631 --> 02:20.565
Lieutenant, he's
leaking too bad!

02:20.599 --> 02:21.901
here's not much
I can do about it here.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.270
<i>It felt like I had
been here before,</i>

02:26.639 --> 02:28.440
<i>so many times</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:33.445
It's just a matter of time
before they roll down.

02:33.478 --> 02:35.915
<i>I didn't even know
who they were.</i>

02:35.948 --> 02:39.284
<i>Everything was starting
to blur together.</i>

02:39.317 --> 02:42.420
<i>I had fought so many battles.</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:45.958
<i>Faced so many adversaries.</i>

02:45.992 --> 02:47.126
<i>There's a haze.</i>

02:49.461 --> 02:53.431
<i>She told me that if I left
she wouldn't take me back.</i>

02:53.465 --> 02:56.269
<i>So I left.</i>

02:56.301 --> 02:58.336
<i>Maybe that was a mistake.</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:08.281
Where the fuck
are they coming from?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.783
<i>That's me...
Lieutenant John Cutter.</i>

03:10.817 --> 03:11.951
<i>Rangers.</i>

03:11.984 --> 03:14.787
<i>We've been tasked
to rescue a VIP and his family</i>

03:14.821 --> 03:17.455
<i>from a small terrorist
cell in West Africa.</i>

03:17.489 --> 03:20.126
<i>What we didn't know is they were
being led by the world's most</i>

03:20.159 --> 03:21.627
<i>notorious war criminal.</i>

03:23.162 --> 03:25.497
<i>Igor Rodin.</i>

03:25.530 --> 03:30.136
<i>Rodin headed up a multi-national
terrorist organization.</i>

03:30.169 --> 03:32.337
<i>With militias from
around the world</i>

03:32.370 --> 03:34.807
<i>that he could call on, anytime.</i>

03:34.841 --> 03:36.175
American rangers

03:38.010 --> 03:41.314
cease fire, you are surrounded.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.181
Sir.

03:43.683 --> 03:45.985
We are completely surrounded.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.687
<i>We were completely surrounded.</i>

03:50.890 --> 03:54.994
<i>I was having second thoughts
about this mission.</i>

03:55.027 --> 03:59.364
<i>Some things just didn't add up.</i>

03:59.397 --> 04:00.199
Sir,

04:02.367 --> 04:05.338
what the fuck are
we going to do?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.873
Return fire on these assholes.

04:06.906 --> 04:08.007
Keep it tight.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.507
Conserve your ammo.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.509
Debo, get in
command on the line.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.544
And Kees,

04:12.577 --> 04:13.478
Sir,

04:13.511 --> 04:15.047
intel says this used
to be a mining camp.

04:15.081 --> 04:16.015
There's tunnels
leading out here...

04:16.048 --> 04:18.017
you find me an exit
and you do it fast!

04:18.050 --> 04:18.851
Copy.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.058
Lieutenant, I've got
Colonel Anderson for you.

04:27.894 --> 04:28.761
Colonel.

04:28.794 --> 04:30.562
I thought everything
was under control.

04:30.595 --> 04:31.931
Now what the hell happened?

04:33.431 --> 04:35.034
What's happened?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.369
I'll tell you what
fucking happened...

04:36.401 --> 04:37.469
your intel was for shit.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.372
There's a full rebel brigade
out there, mechanized.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.040
Cutter, calm down.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.075
I'll calm down once
you give me my QRF.

04:43.109 --> 04:44.243
I need air support.

04:44.277 --> 04:45.711
These bastards have armor.

04:48.446 --> 04:49.882
We're gonna die aren't we?

04:49.916 --> 04:50.883
Adam!

04:50.917 --> 04:52.385
No, sir you will not.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.386
Seven minutes.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.720
Copy that.

04:54.754 --> 04:56.222
Give them our coordinates.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.225
Roger control, friendlies on
the ground and heavy assault,

04:59.258 --> 05:01.593
proceeding with
new co-ordinates.

05:16.142 --> 05:19.278
Carter get the family to
the next room we're leaving.

05:19.312 --> 05:20.112
Fire!

05:30.622 --> 05:31.791
No!

06:20.172 --> 06:21.140
Motherfuckers!

06:21.173 --> 06:22.641
They must have
called for support.

06:22.675 --> 06:24.477
Keyes, you find me
that back door.

06:24.542 --> 06:25.811
I can't find shit!

06:25.845 --> 06:27.847
Keep it frosty Keyes,
sweep the other rooms.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.527
Sir, I think I found something.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.002
Keyes!

06:51.037 --> 06:53.339
Fuck, Joe, how you doing man?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.841
Oh shit.

06:55.875 --> 06:56.709
Okay.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.544
Slow, slow, slow.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.182
I'll go check on the guys.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.683
Suck it up.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.354
We've got to get
the fuck out of here.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.356
Come on man.

07:25.237 --> 07:25.771
D-bo!

07:45.424 --> 07:45.925
John.

07:47.626 --> 07:48.727
How many guys?

07:48.761 --> 07:49.594
They're gone.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.232
Harris?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.066
Pendulum.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.102
This is Castle,
we're making our in.

07:56.135 --> 07:57.103
Mark your position.

07:57.136 --> 07:59.271
Dangerous close,
ready one, drop on our position.

07:59.305 --> 08:02.408
I repeat dangerous close
drop on our position.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.644
All right pendulum
it's your ass, cover up.

08:07.947 --> 08:09.614
Come on.

08:09.648 --> 08:11.250
I got you.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.634
Alright boy let's go.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.167
Up.

09:03.002 --> 09:03.903
Rest up.

09:03.936 --> 09:06.472
You're going to need
your strength today.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.207
You little son of a gun.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.220
Been a while Lieutenant.

09:25.191 --> 09:25.858
Yes, sir.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.828
Congratulations on
the promotion, General.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.830
And how's the guide business?

09:31.864 --> 09:32.998
You looking to do some hunting?

09:33.032 --> 09:33.999
I am.

09:34.033 --> 09:36.001
The season starts in October.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.403
Terrorists are always in season.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.175
I'm out, General.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.678
This is something different.

09:44.743 --> 09:45.844
Well, I was discharged.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.346
You're going on a
private contract.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.514
We do it all the time.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.849
You're qualified.
You're in good shape.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.185
General, I'm no good.

09:53.219 --> 09:54.520
I failed.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.888
I left my team behind.

09:55.921 --> 09:57.691
John they were dead.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.191
Africa was a rough gig.

09:59.225 --> 10:01.727
You think we sent the Rangers in
because it was easy?

10:01.760 --> 10:04.196
We teach you guys everything
except how to fail.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.701
My God, you'd think we'd
have figured that out by now.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.536
John, it wasn't your fault.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.706
Then whose fault was it?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.708
Those men were
my responsibility.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.709
Listen John.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.043
Joey's still alive
because of you.

10:18.077 --> 10:20.212
The truth is I
need you for this.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.047
Your country needs you.

10:22.081 --> 10:23.415
You're a good soldier General.

10:25.084 --> 10:27.219
But a shitty salesman.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.221
Okay.

10:29.255 --> 10:30.256
Igor Rodin.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.394
He's the target.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.895
Igor Rodin is dead.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.734
- Intel said the air s-
- Intel was wrong.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.602
- He was shot there
- John please.

10:43.637 --> 10:45.437
I need you to ID him.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.434
Shitty salesman, huh?

11:15.467 --> 11:16.935
Some things sell themselves.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.937
Thanks for being here.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.506
Lets go meet the guys.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.278
Gentlemen.

11:26.312 --> 11:27.513
Sir.
General!

11:27.546 --> 11:30.282
This is Mr. Cutter civilian
contractor, background airborne,

11:30.316 --> 11:32.117
ex-officer in the rangers.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.788
Mr. cutter has met our
target and will ID him for us.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.622
Chief take us
through the rest of y'all.

11:36.656 --> 11:37.990
All right, guys, listen up.

11:38.023 --> 11:39.626
This is a direct
action operation

11:39.659 --> 11:41.126
'Capture or kill the target'.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.662
We go in his legion one.

11:42.696 --> 11:44.463
We're about 20 nautical
miles off shore.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.965
2,100, hit that water,
swim the rest of the way.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.967
Mr. Cutter, you are scuba
certified I assume.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.637
Six weeks at NDSTC.

11:50.670 --> 11:51.503
Good enough.

11:51.537 --> 11:52.838
This ain't no dip in the pool.

11:52.871 --> 11:54.840
These Albanians
are paranoid as shit.

11:54.873 --> 11:57.309
Activity around the port
will be extremely high.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.178
At least a dozen
soldiers and a few boats

11:59.211 --> 12:00.814
patrolling in the water.

12:00.846 --> 12:01.815
Who's the target?

12:01.847 --> 12:03.148
Igor Rodin.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.819
Interpol has a file on him,
10 pages long.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.520
But he now seems to be
upping his game.

12:08.554 --> 12:10.489
We tracked him buying up
toxic waste,

12:10.522 --> 12:12.358
from a base,
here in Eastern Europe.

12:12.391 --> 12:13.492
Munitions dump.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.527
He's gotten hold of
300,000 gallons of

12:15.561 --> 12:17.996
some of the worst
shit known to mankind.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.531
Now the toxic
barrels by themselves

12:19.565 --> 12:21.166
don't amount to much.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.002
But coupled with the right bomb
a sizable chunk of this planet

12:24.036 --> 12:26.372
will be uninhabitable
for the next 200 years.

12:26.405 --> 12:28.006
That's where the three
scientists come in.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.676
3 scientists went missing.

12:29.709 --> 12:32.177
Chemical engineer, physicist,
mechanical engineer.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.013
By themselves not one of them
was capable of making a bomb.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.014
But together.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.016
That's one hell of
a lethal cocktail.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.719
We have a six hour window.

12:39.753 --> 12:41.855
If they finish the assembly,
we're done.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.389
I advise you all
to familiarize yourself

12:43.422 --> 12:44.890
with the details in your logs.

12:44.923 --> 12:46.225
Any questions?

12:46.258 --> 12:48.093
Gentlemen I've got to
make a transmission.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.699
Alright boys, get some rest.

12:52.732 --> 12:55.200
John I'll catch
you pre-mission.

12:55.234 --> 12:55.934
Yes, sir.

13:05.411 --> 13:07.212
John Cutter.

13:07.246 --> 13:07.781
Yeah.

13:07.814 --> 13:10.048
Lieutenant John Cutter.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.216
I used to be.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.086
JSOC, Africa command,
three years ago.

13:14.119 --> 13:14.888
Yeah, that's me.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.255
Lost your team.

13:17.956 --> 13:19.391
Something like that.

13:19.425 --> 13:20.592
Heard you washed out.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.731
It's pretty hard to go on giving
orders after that one, Chief.

13:24.764 --> 13:25.397
I bet.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.099
It was pretty rough stuff.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.739
I know FUBAR, man.

13:32.772 --> 13:34.072
I don't judge you.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.574
Where are you getting at chief?

13:35.607 --> 13:37.409
Why are you coming with us?

13:37.443 --> 13:39.244
Just stay her on the sub.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.914
We'll send you back
a video after we kill Rodin.

13:40.946 --> 13:41.947
You confirm it on datalink.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.450
The General thinks
I need to be there.

13:44.483 --> 13:46.452
I'm the only one that knows
what Rodin looks like.

13:46.485 --> 13:47.921
We're after a bomb.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.421
This ain't a personal vendetta.

13:49.455 --> 13:50.255
Too late.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.759
I got six guys
I got to get home.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.092
Copy?

13:54.126 --> 13:55.260
Yeah I copy.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.930
Good.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.096
We've got about six hours,

13:58.130 --> 14:00.432
then this thing
dumps us in the Adriatic.

14:00.466 --> 14:01.768
I want you to ask yourself.

14:01.801 --> 14:03.469
Am I good to go?

14:03.502 --> 14:05.270
If you're not all in.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.305
Do us all a favor.

14:09.676 --> 14:10.810
Don't go.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.791
Nice family.

14:24.824 --> 14:26.291
Thanks man.

14:26.325 --> 14:27.660
Never easy to say goodbye,
you now.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.799
I'm Marcus Cooper.

14:32.832 --> 14:33.465
Call me Coop.

14:33.499 --> 14:35.133
John Cutter.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.836
Welcome aboard John.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.136
So, you got kids?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.304
No.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.472
A wife?

14:40.506 --> 14:41.006
No.

14:41.039 --> 14:41.841
Girlfriend?

14:43.342 --> 14:44.476
Well, there's Spud.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.477
Spud?

14:45.511 --> 14:46.813
Yeah he's a Golden lab mix.

14:46.846 --> 14:48.982
Okay, man's best friend, right?

14:49.014 --> 14:51.316
As long as I'm feeding him.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.685
I'm gonna sack out.

14:52.719 --> 14:53.352
Cool man.

15:19.378 --> 15:22.180
Look Nina, I want to do this job
and go home.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.383
And you know he'll kill us
the minute it's finished.

15:26.418 --> 15:27.854
If you believe that,

15:27.887 --> 15:30.188
why keep working?

15:30.222 --> 15:32.692
Because any hope
is better than that.

15:32.725 --> 15:33.559
Hope?

15:35.594 --> 15:36.528
I've seen hope,

15:36.562 --> 15:38.031
drive people across the desert,

15:38.063 --> 15:40.232
thousands of miles,

15:40.265 --> 15:44.536
only to die of starvation
the moment they find the food.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.204
I have seen the hope
drive the people,

15:46.238 --> 15:49.042
day after day to
some shitty factories,

15:49.074 --> 15:50.710
until after 80 years,

15:50.743 --> 15:52.377
they simply expired,

15:52.411 --> 15:53.412
and you say hope.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.115
He needs a hospital.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.921
I need my bomb quicker.

16:01.955 --> 16:04.057
We're moving as fast as we can.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.758
You had better be.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.728
What if I start
the reaction now?

16:08.761 --> 16:12.097
And blow us all to hell.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.634
Then at the very least, I
would be pleasantly surprised.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.073
Do it.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.075
Don't tempt me.

16:22.107 --> 16:22.775
Do it.

16:36.622 --> 16:37.289
Nina.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.965
But what will that do,

16:45.999 --> 16:47.299
for your hope?

16:52.639 --> 16:53.138
Bye!

17:21.834 --> 17:25.170
Stay tight. We don't want make
a wave signature.

17:25.203 --> 17:28.339
Rodin's underwater sensors
are so sensitive,

17:28.373 --> 17:30.342
that if a shark
were to take a shit,

17:30.375 --> 17:32.377
they would pick
that shit up, literally.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.349
Cutter where do you say
you earned your scuba cert?

17:37.382 --> 17:39.184
The local YMCA?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.554
NDSTC.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.342
Slow it down gents.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.179
These mines are hot.

18:06.244 --> 18:07.345
Shut up Cutter.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.682
I'll swim as fast
as I goddamn want.

18:09.716 --> 18:11.684
Danimal, I would
listen to Cutter.

18:11.718 --> 18:14.721
Whose side are you on Coop?

18:14.754 --> 18:16.055
Just keep it tight.

18:16.089 --> 18:18.356
Heard about the last time
you were on a mission Cutter...

18:18.390 --> 18:20.059
you lost five fucking men.

18:20.093 --> 18:22.028
Don't talk about things
you don't know about.

18:22.061 --> 18:24.063
Hey we're on a mission here.

18:24.097 --> 18:25.932
Now get your shit
in line, Cutter.

18:32.105 --> 18:34.040
Cutter, don't listen to
what the fuck they're saying.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.540
Bunch of dicks.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.542
Let's just keep it moving.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.212
Good one Cutter.

18:39.277 --> 18:39.912
Come on Coop.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.217
Look at me Cutter.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.919
I'm not keeping it tight.

18:46.953 --> 18:49.222
Fucking asshole.

18:49.254 --> 18:49.922
Oh my-

18:49.956 --> 18:51.389
- Oh my God
- Cutter?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.226
Danimal!

18:53.258 --> 18:54.292
What the fuck?

19:04.804 --> 19:07.907
I need divers in the water now.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.574
Roger that.

19:09.608 --> 19:13.246
Let£s make this fast.
I have a hot date tonight.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.924
Well, they know we're here now,
gents.

19:24.957 --> 19:25.792
Double time it.

19:38.336 --> 19:39.604
Mr. Rodin,

19:40.605 --> 19:42.942
One of our underwater mines
was triggered.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.309
I have deployed divers,

19:44.342 --> 19:46.279
but it may be
the incursion you feared.

19:46.344 --> 19:47.947
By the time they're reporting?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.615
We may not have the time
to finish the bomb.

19:50.650 --> 19:51.449
No matter.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.451
We'll finish it en route.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.319
Doctor Islef.

19:54.352 --> 19:55.520
We are moving on.

19:55.554 --> 19:57.790
Bring with you, only what
you need to finish a project.

19:57.824 --> 19:58.991
What about Yuri?

20:01.493 --> 20:04.163
He is not needed anymore.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.502
Prepare yourselves to leave.

20:12.672 --> 20:14.674
The time is not on
our side doctor.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.711
He was never going to recover.
We both know that.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.319
Now. Go.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.753
Move.

20:35.895 --> 20:37.362
We got this boys.

20:37.395 --> 20:38.698
Remember your training.

20:58.718 --> 21:01.187
You and Mikhail
go to discotheque?

21:01.220 --> 21:03.689
No, Mikhail£s on
barrel duty.

21:03.723 --> 21:05.390
I'm taking Tomas.

21:05.423 --> 21:06.893
He knows how to tango.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.394
Go, go, go.

21:11.898 --> 21:13.398
Go, go, go.

21:20.907 --> 21:23.376
American scum!

21:23.408 --> 21:25.244
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

21:33.252 --> 21:34.287
No!

21:39.292 --> 21:40.425
Cutter.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.061
You know your shit.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.429
I wished Danimal
had listened to you.

21:49.302 --> 21:50.937
Why do you hate God
so much, Igor?

21:52.772 --> 21:54.273
Look at the world, Niki.

21:54.307 --> 21:58.244
The innocent suffer,
the guilty prosper.

21:58.277 --> 22:01.747
God made us in his image,
what does it tell you about him?

22:01.781 --> 22:03.615
It means he is a motherfucker
just like me.

22:08.955 --> 22:12.425
Can't this piece of shit
go any faster?

22:12.457 --> 22:13.926
We can't go faster
than the truck...

22:13.960 --> 22:16.594
the truck has
2000 kilos in the back.

22:16.629 --> 22:18.264
Nevermind,
soon we'll be rich men.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.132
I hope it's true.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.436
Don't hope Vladimir. Hope is for
peasants and priests.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.469
We are soldiers.

22:24.502 --> 22:26.272
We are making our destiny.

22:26.305 --> 22:27.472
We don't pray for it.

22:35.181 --> 22:37.615
Miguel, counterclockwise.
Look.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.286
Come on,
this is not a discotheque.

24:16.916 --> 24:18.884
Hurry up they're inside.

24:18.918 --> 24:20.585
Where is Vishan?

24:20.618 --> 24:23.889
He call in fever sick.

24:23.923 --> 24:26.559
I radio for replacement.

24:46.445 --> 24:47.446
Mikhail Dromislov,

24:47.480 --> 24:49.614
Reporting for
replacement duty, Sir.

24:49.648 --> 24:52.918
Mikhail you're not
replacing anybody.

24:52.952 --> 24:55.754
Please give me chance.

24:55.788 --> 24:57.289
Fuck this up,

24:57.323 --> 24:59.792
Barrel duty for life.

25:02.128 --> 25:03.596
Hurry up with the charges.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.631
Something doesn't look right.

25:09.168 --> 25:10.636
Hey Chief,

25:10.669 --> 25:12.938
you better come see this.

25:12.972 --> 25:14.807
Been dead nearly a half hour.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.142
Toxic waste.

25:16.175 --> 25:18.277
Yeah.

25:18.310 --> 25:21.647
These tanks must be full
with whatever did that to him.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.482
Let's go.

25:34.827 --> 25:35.961
Chief!

25:39.698 --> 25:41.667
Take cover!

26:06.358 --> 26:07.860
Look at me, look at me!

26:09.361 --> 26:10.863
We need to fucking move now.

26:10.896 --> 26:12.498
And go where man?

26:12.531 --> 26:16.670
Danimal's dead, Ross is dead and
Chief's a fucking meatball.

26:16.702 --> 26:20.539
We just missed the target so
we fucked that deal.

26:20.573 --> 26:23.709
We just pissed off the entire
fucking Albanian army.

26:23.742 --> 26:25.544
Thought you Seals were tough.

26:28.214 --> 26:31.016
I don't have many
breathes left...

26:31.050 --> 26:33.052
don't make me waste 'em
running you down.

26:36.889 --> 26:40.192
You stow your weapon
and sharpen up.

26:43.896 --> 26:47.399
Let me hear you say
"Aye, aye, Master Chief".

26:47.433 --> 26:49.568
Aye aye Master Chief.

26:51.570 --> 26:52.871
Now listen up.

26:52.905 --> 26:55.541
Cutter's going to get you home.

26:55.574 --> 26:57.711
You take orders from
him from now on.

26:57.743 --> 26:58.744
He's a fucking sin.

26:58.777 --> 27:00.546
He's an officer.

27:00.579 --> 27:02.581
You ain't qualified
to make a tougher

27:02.615 --> 27:05.417
choice than
''paper or plastic''.

27:05.451 --> 27:07.553
and that's an order.
Let me hear it!

27:07.586 --> 27:09.421
- Aye aye Master Chief
- Aye aye Master Chief

27:12.258 --> 27:14.893
You guys are a great team.

27:14.927 --> 27:18.564
I hate to bitch out
at you like this.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.400
You just worry about
finding a way out of here.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.935
Find us a truck moving out.

27:22.968 --> 27:25.237
Go, Come on.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.582
See you downrange.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.817
See you there, Rookie.

27:59.639 --> 28:01.440
What the hell are you doing?

28:01.473 --> 28:03.309
You get my boys home.

28:04.977 --> 28:08.947
I don't exactly have
the best track record.

28:08.981 --> 28:11.950
You better.
Or I will haunt your ass.

28:11.984 --> 28:16.155
Tier 1 poltergeist
shit, you copy?

28:16.188 --> 28:17.122
Yeah, copy.

28:17.156 --> 28:19.325
They knew we were coming here.

28:19.358 --> 28:21.460
Just something ain't right.

28:21.493 --> 28:23.797
What do you think
we should do Chief?

28:23.829 --> 28:27.299
Call the General,
tell him you're coming back.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.967
Roger that.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.502
Give me that frag, will you?

28:48.354 --> 28:50.724
Good luck, Cutter.

28:58.197 --> 28:59.331
Chief?

28:59.365 --> 29:00.065
Drive.

29:12.211 --> 29:13.512
Welcome,

29:13.545 --> 29:16.348
gentlemen.

29:16.382 --> 29:17.851
To hell!

29:34.400 --> 29:36.703
Sir, we have Legion 1 on the sat
link.

29:36.736 --> 29:37.536
Chief Ryan?

29:37.569 --> 29:39.405
No, Sir. Cutter.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.042
John?

29:44.076 --> 29:45.043
General.

29:45.077 --> 29:46.211
Where's Chief Ryan?

29:46.245 --> 29:48.046
He's gone.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.549
So is Dan and Russ.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.886
And Rodin?

29:52.918 --> 29:54.386
Negative.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.255
Looks like they blew out
of there before we arrived.

29:56.288 --> 29:58.924
We need an exfil-

29:58.957 --> 30:00.894
We had a UAV
up over their base

30:00.926 --> 30:03.395
and tracked three vehicles
leaving 10 minutes ago.

30:03.429 --> 30:05.063
One of them was kicking out
enough neutrons

30:05.097 --> 30:06.932
to light up like
an electric lightbulb.

30:06.965 --> 30:09.401
Assume Rodin is with the bomb

30:09.435 --> 30:11.437
you'll be heading
for Nagorna Stasi.

30:11.470 --> 30:14.106
It's an army base about
10 miles to your west.

30:14.139 --> 30:16.575
Sir we need a way out.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.576
You and the remaining members

30:17.609 --> 30:19.578
of your team are
all we have there.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.914
General these men are tired.

30:20.979 --> 30:22.247
They lost their leader,

30:22.281 --> 30:23.917
friends, we're low on ammo.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.251
God dammit John, when
that bomb's gone, it's gone.

30:26.285 --> 30:27.953
Imagine the role of
that truck in Paris,

30:27.986 --> 30:29.789
Berlin or Moscow and set it off.

30:29.823 --> 30:32.591
I don't know what you're going
to have to go to find it.

30:32.624 --> 30:33.626
But you've got to dig deep and

30:33.660 --> 30:35.093
find whatever it is you've lost

30:35.127 --> 30:36.328
and finish this.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.766
Otherwise two good men
died for nothing

30:39.799 --> 30:41.500
and hell of a lot
more will follow.

30:46.673 --> 30:47.606
John?

30:47.640 --> 30:48.974
I know what Chief would say.

30:50.476 --> 30:51.977
I promised to get you guys home.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.480
Some promises no-one can keep.

30:56.148 --> 30:57.449
We're Seals, John.

30:57.483 --> 30:59.786
We finish the fucking mission,
no matter what.

30:59.819 --> 31:01.487
John, are you there?

31:04.990 --> 31:07.660
Send us the data, you have.

31:07.694 --> 31:10.996
We'll stop this
bastard for you Sir.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.162
Is that our truck?

31:44.196 --> 31:46.231
Won't know until we look inside.

31:48.701 --> 31:51.370
So what's the plan?

31:51.403 --> 31:53.338
We do it loud.

31:53.372 --> 31:54.841
There's only five of us.

31:54.874 --> 31:57.677
Yeah, they don't know that.
We hit 'em so hard and so fast

31:57.710 --> 32:00.379
they'll think there's whole
motherfucking division out here.

32:00.412 --> 32:02.514
You know, I like this guy.

32:02.548 --> 32:04.684
To think I almost stabbed
him a few hours ago.

32:04.717 --> 32:07.219
He almost kicked your
ass a few hours ago.

32:07.252 --> 32:08.855
Can the grab ass.

32:08.888 --> 32:09.521
All right.

32:09.555 --> 32:10.355
Pinky, Nick...

32:10.389 --> 32:12.025
I want you guys on Alpha team.

32:12.057 --> 32:13.225
Take a look inside the truck.

32:13.258 --> 32:15.193
Coop, you're on Bravo, all by

32:15.227 --> 32:17.030
your lonesome. I want
you on the long gun.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.196
When the shit hits fan

32:18.230 --> 32:19.732
secure the truck, we move out.

32:19.766 --> 32:21.199
Frank, you're with me
on Charlie team

32:21.233 --> 32:23.870
We'll hit the main building
we'll do a quick intel sweep.

32:23.903 --> 32:25.203
Good to go?

32:25.237 --> 32:26.204
Yeah, let's go.

32:26.238 --> 32:27.072
Lock and load.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.731
The convoy. Where did they go?!

32:51.764 --> 32:53.432
I don't know.

32:53.465 --> 32:54.566
Okay, okay!

32:54.600 --> 32:56.568
They never stop here.

32:56.602 --> 32:58.738
They went straight to Golyama.

32:58.771 --> 33:00.272
What's this?

33:00.305 --> 33:01.239
Train station.

34:40.539 --> 34:41.708
Run!

34:45.078 --> 34:46.713
Argh!

34:50.248 --> 34:51.884
John, get in!

35:11.738 --> 35:14.406
Pinky! You good to drive?

35:14.439 --> 35:16.374
Yeah!

35:16.408 --> 35:18.243
Stay on this road, I know where
they're going.

35:18.276 --> 35:20.046
How?

35:20.079 --> 35:21.914
Golyama train station.

35:21.948 --> 35:23.248
Five miles north of here.

35:23.281 --> 35:24.416
Call it in.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.761
Fuck.

35:34.794 --> 35:37.096
You're one lucky bastard,
you know that?

35:55.347 --> 35:58.117
Careful, careful... yes.

36:04.123 --> 36:08.094
You have one hour
to finish the bomb.

36:08.127 --> 36:10.263
What guarantee do you have

36:10.295 --> 36:13.298
the you will not shoot us
like you did Yuri?

36:13.331 --> 36:14.267
None.

36:14.299 --> 36:15.935
Just my word.

36:15.968 --> 36:18.436
I gain nothing by your death.

36:18.470 --> 36:21.439
The Americans already
know I have the weapon.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.943
Now it's just a game of time.

36:23.976 --> 36:25.978
One hour.

36:29.982 --> 36:33.318
What other choice do
we have?

36:33.351 --> 36:35.021
Let's work.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.635
Stop!

36:49.669 --> 36:50.335
Oh!

36:52.705 --> 36:54.006
Where are you going?

36:57.009 --> 37:00.478
Coop, I want you and the
others take this road southwest.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.815
You'll run into a small
fishing village. Steal a boat,

37:02.849 --> 37:04.349
you'll be in Italian
waters by nightfall.

37:04.382 --> 37:06.484
You're gonna take on
those guys on your own?

37:06.518 --> 37:07.987
Just one.

37:08.020 --> 37:08.988
We're coming with you.

37:09.021 --> 37:10.823
Pink, you're good.

37:10.857 --> 37:12.357
But one arm... you ain't
no good to me.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.026
I can still put out.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.996
Who's gonna get Nick home if
Pink's only got one good arm?

37:17.029 --> 37:18.664
That's an order.

37:18.698 --> 37:19.866
Hey man, if I can't stop him

37:19.899 --> 37:21.499
someone has to let
General Anderson know

37:21.533 --> 37:23.501
the bomb is on that train.

37:23.535 --> 37:24.871
12 hours from now
that train could be

37:24.904 --> 37:28.040
in the heart of Europe...
Germany, Austria, Russia.

37:28.074 --> 37:30.343
Letting that train go free
is like putting a virus

37:30.375 --> 37:31.844
directly in the bloodstream
of the continent.

37:31.878 --> 37:33.179
Anderson will know what to do.

37:33.212 --> 37:34.013
Go.

37:34.046 --> 37:36.349
Good luck.

37:36.381 --> 37:37.515
Hey Coop?

37:37.549 --> 37:38.684
Yeah?

37:38.718 --> 37:40.686
If I fuck this up,

37:40.720 --> 37:42.855
I want you to go to NOLA for me.

37:42.889 --> 37:44.190
There's a joint there,

37:44.223 --> 37:47.193
it's called
The Coach and Horses.

37:47.226 --> 37:49.028
There's a bartender.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.863
Can't miss her.

37:50.897 --> 37:54.200
eyes even one of you
frogmen could drown in.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.369
She's got Spud.
Her name's Jenna.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.204
Listen, man, you'll be taking
care of that yourself.

37:58.237 --> 37:59.272
And if I can't...?

38:03.743 --> 38:06.879
We've been thinking
getting a dog ourselves.

38:06.913 --> 38:08.114
He'll have a good home.

40:48.407 --> 40:49.574
Where have you been?

40:49.607 --> 40:51.210
Looking at the train.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.045
You're lucky you didn't miss it.

40:53.079 --> 40:55.214
Papa, there's lots of
soldiers on this train

40:55.247 --> 40:57.716
and they have guns.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.885
Right. Now...

40:59.919 --> 41:02.388
sit down.

41:02.421 --> 41:04.924
We have a long trip.

41:17.470 --> 41:18.571
Get ready to move.

41:18.603 --> 41:19.905
Where to?

41:19.939 --> 41:20.773
North.

41:20.806 --> 41:22.775
No way, we are not
clear to go north.

41:24.777 --> 41:26.112
Are we clear now?

41:27.947 --> 41:28.781
Go.

41:37.957 --> 41:40.259
Papa, papa, we're moving.

42:03.816 --> 42:05.117
He has a gun.

42:05.151 --> 42:08.120
Son, you need to be quiet.

42:11.157 --> 42:13.826
Ha-ha, nice try.

42:16.195 --> 42:18.464
Good afternoon, everybody.
Welcome on board

42:18.497 --> 42:22.636
train 290 with non-stop
service to hell.

42:22.668 --> 42:26.138
For the duration of our travel
I will be a host.

42:26.172 --> 42:28.807
My name is none
of your business.

42:28.841 --> 42:31.477
And in case of an emergency...

42:31.510 --> 42:34.480
all of you will probably die.

42:34.513 --> 42:38.317
Please, sir. We are
peaceful people. We are...

42:38.350 --> 42:41.487
You serve a single function...

42:41.520 --> 42:46.692
All of you will act like
shields to protect me.

42:46.725 --> 42:52.831
Your lives mean as little
to me as that of insects.

42:52.865 --> 42:57.169
If you wish to get off of this
train, you will be a obedient.

42:57.203 --> 42:59.004
You will be silent!

42:59.038 --> 43:02.875
Believe in me as father
here believes in God.

43:02.908 --> 43:06.212
You can survive
with this, and now...

43:06.245 --> 43:07.880
The choice is yours.

43:15.221 --> 43:17.256
Clean this up, will you?

43:43.115 --> 43:44.883
It's a bit early
to celebrate, isn't it?

43:44.917 --> 43:48.387
I'm drinking
champagne for pleasure.

43:48.420 --> 43:50.589
Not for some special occasions.

43:59.098 --> 44:02.601
Jamal! It's your friend, Igor.

44:02.636 --> 44:04.103
Yes, we are on the way

44:05.639 --> 44:07.906
I received the deposit
and now you need to

44:07.940 --> 44:09.408
escrow the remainder of the fee

44:09.441 --> 44:11.443
with our friends
from Switzerland.

44:13.279 --> 44:15.581
Of course the device is ready!

44:15.614 --> 44:18.083
It will perform
precisely as demonstrated.

44:18.117 --> 44:20.654
If not, keep away your
one hundred million.

44:22.288 --> 44:23.122
Bye.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.095
Zivko!

44:30.129 --> 44:31.597
I want to know the second

44:31.631 --> 44:34.300
the money hits
the escrow account.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.677
Nikola... for Christ's sakes.

45:17.711 --> 45:18.977
What is wrong?

45:19.011 --> 45:20.479
There is a long way
to go in here

45:20.512 --> 45:22.147
playing romantic-man
with this girl.

45:22.181 --> 45:26.653
There are no more moves.
No more decisions to make.

45:26.686 --> 45:28.688
If we have made our plans well,

45:28.722 --> 45:30.489
then we will succeed.

45:30.522 --> 45:35.527
If no, we will fail... and
nothing can change that now.

45:46.905 --> 45:48.040
Nina!

45:48.073 --> 45:51.043
Check if the solenoid
on 14 is connected.

45:51.076 --> 45:52.177
It's fine.

45:52.211 --> 45:55.514
No, it's not. I'm not
getting the signal.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.349
Gregor, it is connected.

45:57.383 --> 45:58.718
Come see for yourself.

46:04.056 --> 46:05.557
I'm disconnecting the container

46:05.591 --> 46:07.593
from the pressure
valves to the fuel.

46:09.228 --> 46:11.698
But that will disable the bomb.

46:11.731 --> 46:13.399
Precisely.

46:15.067 --> 46:16.870
He will kill us.

46:16.902 --> 46:18.537
He's going to do that anyway.

46:18.570 --> 46:21.907
I won't let him
get away with this.

46:21.940 --> 46:24.910
Nina, please. Don't do this.

46:24.943 --> 46:26.211
I have a family...

46:26.245 --> 46:27.379
- Back to work!
- He's going to...

46:27.413 --> 46:28.580
Guard!

46:30.449 --> 46:31.383
Stop her!

46:31.417 --> 46:32.752
Coward.

46:39.925 --> 46:42.561
Hey!

46:42.594 --> 46:45.063
Oh! Hold on...

46:45.097 --> 46:48.267
Hold on, I got my ticket,
alright? It's...

46:53.773 --> 46:57.777
Call me Igor,
please.

47:00.946 --> 47:03.081
What?!

47:03.115 --> 47:05.584
Explain.

47:05.617 --> 47:10.657
She has disconnected the firing
circuits to the valve-solenoids

47:14.126 --> 47:15.628
What does it mean?

47:17.797 --> 47:19.465
Sabotage.

47:37.015 --> 47:39.786
Can you fix it?

47:39.819 --> 47:41.119
I believe so.

47:41.153 --> 47:43.322
Asshole.

47:50.529 --> 47:52.966
You believe?

47:52.998 --> 47:55.300
For one million dollars,

47:55.334 --> 47:57.135
I could be certain.

47:57.169 --> 47:58.972
One?

47:59.004 --> 48:01.006
Da, one.

48:01.039 --> 48:06.144
One million dollars in a
Swiss account with a name on it.

48:06.178 --> 48:08.313
Can be done.

48:08.347 --> 48:10.148
How long do you need?

48:10.182 --> 48:12.317
Forty-five minutes, no more.

48:12.351 --> 48:14.988
Go. Get it right.

48:15.020 --> 48:17.657
Nikola, go with him
and protect him,

48:17.690 --> 48:18.858
like he is your son.

48:18.892 --> 48:20.359
Okay.

48:25.865 --> 48:27.165
Sir, I'm in.

48:27.199 --> 48:28.902
I'm gonna shut down the system.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.569
Make any sound and
I will end your life.

49:06.071 --> 49:08.041
You speak English?

49:08.073 --> 49:09.107
I do.

49:11.243 --> 49:12.578
Who are you?

49:12.611 --> 49:14.714
I'm asking the questions.

49:14.747 --> 49:15.882
What are you doing here?

49:15.915 --> 49:17.717
I'm the conductor.

49:17.750 --> 49:18.751
Veselin.

49:21.587 --> 49:23.422
How many of them are on board?

49:26.291 --> 49:27.894
Thank God you're not with them.

49:27.927 --> 49:29.094
How many?

49:30.763 --> 49:33.733
Hm, they're around
twenty of them.

49:33.766 --> 49:36.268
I'm not sure what is happening
in the two front carriages.

49:36.301 --> 49:37.235
They won't let me in.

49:37.269 --> 49:38.403
I need a phone.

49:38.437 --> 49:40.238
Cell phones don't work here.

49:40.272 --> 49:41.908
Not for the next 300 kilometers.

49:41.941 --> 49:43.910
What about for emergencies?

49:43.943 --> 49:45.277
You can use mine.

49:47.279 --> 49:50.083
But it's connected only
to the dispatcher's office.

49:50.148 --> 49:51.784
Then put me on it.

50:14.139 --> 50:15.775
Control.

50:15.808 --> 50:16.943
Who's this?

50:16.976 --> 50:19.611
This is control
agent Boris Tamesh

50:19.646 --> 50:23.482
4, 3, 7, 9, 4... Hey!
Who the hell is this?

50:23.515 --> 50:24.951
John Cutter.

50:24.984 --> 50:26.151
I'm on train to 290.

50:26.184 --> 50:28.788
I need you to contact NATO
headquarters in Brussels,

50:28.821 --> 50:31.623
have them connect you
to U.S. army and then to Italy.

50:31.658 --> 50:32.557
Authorization code is:

50:32.591 --> 50:35.795
Kilo... Tango...
Charlie... 9... 7...

50:37.496 --> 50:38.998
Are you fucking deaf?

50:39.032 --> 50:41.801
No, I'm looking for
the correct regulation

50:41.834 --> 50:45.805
and according authorisation
use of the phone system...

50:45.838 --> 50:48.206
No regulations for a bomb.

50:52.679 --> 50:54.814
Boris, do as he says.

50:54.847 --> 50:57.482
Bandits took over my train.

50:57.516 --> 50:59.018
Veselin, is that you?

51:05.725 --> 51:07.994
This person should
not use our phone.

51:08.027 --> 51:09.327
Hey, listen asshole.

51:09.361 --> 51:11.998
There's a bomb the size of a
fucking minivan on this train.

51:12.031 --> 51:15.500
Tell me again, what
was your name, please?

51:15.534 --> 51:19.005
Tennant John Cutter. Ask for
General Norman Anderson.

51:19.038 --> 51:21.206
And you want me to call NATO?

51:21.239 --> 51:23.341
Da.

51:23.375 --> 51:24.844
Are you going to do it or what?

51:24.877 --> 51:26.012
Yes, I will.

51:26.045 --> 51:27.914
But first, I have
to find...

51:29.882 --> 51:31.851
Line went dead.

51:31.884 --> 51:33.686
Not good.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.021
Someone heard us.

51:35.054 --> 51:36.354
Is there another phone?

51:36.388 --> 51:38.356
Yes... in my office.

51:38.390 --> 51:40.559
Get back there before
they notice you're gone.

51:46.899 --> 51:50.535
Yes, please connect me with
NATO headquarter in Brussels.

51:50.569 --> 51:51.904
It is an emergency call.

52:01.748 --> 52:02.547
Mister?

52:02.581 --> 52:04.549
Woah, hey.

52:04.583 --> 52:07.252
Is there truly a bomb
on this train?

52:07.285 --> 52:10.388
I think so. How did you
know about that?

52:10.422 --> 52:14.426
I heard the big ugly man
talking about a bomb.

52:14.459 --> 52:17.063
Too many of those ugly
big men on this train?

52:17.096 --> 52:19.264
Mister, are you one
of the bad guys?

52:19.297 --> 52:21.934
No, kid. Do I look
like a bad guy?

52:26.139 --> 52:26.906
Here...

52:26.939 --> 52:27.907
Is this for me?

52:27.940 --> 52:30.076
This drawing is for you.

52:30.109 --> 52:33.946
That's where the soldiers are,
and the barrels.

52:33.980 --> 52:38.117
That's the one the big man
and his friends are in.

52:38.151 --> 52:39.752
Here I don't know...

52:39.786 --> 52:41.788
some kind of yellow barrel.

52:43.455 --> 52:45.624
Thank you.

52:48.460 --> 52:51.429
Mr. Rodin

52:51.463 --> 52:54.599
Sir, we have a problem with
one of the passengers.

52:54.634 --> 52:58.137
American or English,
I can't tell.

52:58.171 --> 52:59.972
You're going to fail.

53:02.642 --> 53:05.310
On the line to the main office
he told them about the bomb.

53:05.343 --> 53:06.279
Bastard.

53:06.311 --> 53:08.147
I disconnected
the line, sir, but...

53:15.353 --> 53:17.156
Watch her!

53:23.996 --> 53:26.799
Follow me. Doctor,
if you want to live,

53:26.833 --> 53:29.836
to see that money,
finish the damn bomb!

53:49.387 --> 53:50.156
Control.

53:50.189 --> 53:51.489
Boris, did you make the call?

53:51.523 --> 53:53.025
Yes, I made.

53:53.059 --> 53:54.293
And?

53:54.327 --> 53:58.164
And they told me to please wait
and they'll call back to verify.

53:58.197 --> 53:59.699
Did you tell them
about the bomb?

53:59.732 --> 54:00.333
I did.

54:00.365 --> 54:01.000
And?

54:01.033 --> 54:03.336
And they will call me back...

54:03.368 --> 54:05.671
Boris, you need to yell and
scream until they hear you.

54:05.705 --> 54:07.006
A lot of people are going to die

54:07.039 --> 54:08.040
unless that message
gets through.

54:08.074 --> 54:10.343
Do you understand?

54:24.422 --> 54:26.359
How can I help you?

54:26.391 --> 54:29.195
American. Where
is he?

54:29.228 --> 54:32.231
No, sir... no American here.

54:32.265 --> 54:34.233
You let him use the phone.

54:39.404 --> 54:40.405
No one here.

54:42.074 --> 54:44.576
He was a foreign
provocateur, you fool.

54:44.609 --> 54:46.078
Give me the PA.

54:49.282 --> 54:51.217
American!

54:51.250 --> 54:53.052
I was listening.

54:53.085 --> 54:55.087
You will surrender
yourself to me at once.

54:55.121 --> 54:58.556
If not, I will start
killing passengers.

54:58.590 --> 55:01.928
One at a time. Each
fucking minute.

55:01.961 --> 55:04.730
Until you do.

55:39.298 --> 55:40.433
You're the scientist.

55:40.465 --> 55:41.599
You're the American?

55:41.634 --> 55:43.135
I suppose so.

55:43.169 --> 55:46.272
They're looking for you.
They want to kill you.

55:46.305 --> 55:49.607
You cannot surrender.
You are all we have.

55:49.642 --> 55:51.277
It's okay.

55:51.310 --> 55:53.779
I have no plans of giving up.

55:53.813 --> 55:56.449
Good. You don't have much time.

55:56.481 --> 55:57.615
It's long finished.

55:57.650 --> 55:58.616
So?

55:58.651 --> 55:59.952
How long do I have?

55:59.986 --> 56:01.153
Maybe 15 minutes.

56:04.156 --> 56:07.026
Drop it, or the kid dies.

56:33.686 --> 56:35.321
Who are you?

56:35.354 --> 56:37.023
Mother Teresa.

56:38.523 --> 56:41.327
Mother Teresa?

56:44.363 --> 56:46.032
Nikola!

56:48.533 --> 56:51.003
Let me see what we
have here. Who is he?

56:51.037 --> 56:53.205
He said he's Mother Teresa.

56:55.708 --> 56:58.210
What an idiot.

57:09.221 --> 57:10.523
I know him.

57:10.555 --> 57:13.692
It's always nice to know
you're remembered.

57:13.726 --> 57:17.863
Your pride cost me too
much money that day.

57:17.897 --> 57:21.566
Your greed cost me
the lives of my troopers.

57:21.599 --> 57:22.701
He is an American.

57:22.735 --> 57:23.736
American?

57:23.769 --> 57:26.571
Lieutenant... John
Cutter, right?

57:26.604 --> 57:31.877
We met in Africa.

57:31.911 --> 57:35.047
How did the CIA find me?

57:35.081 --> 57:37.216
Maybe the yellow pages?

57:39.919 --> 57:42.388
That was a total lie.

57:42.421 --> 57:43.722
What are you doing here?

57:43.756 --> 57:47.226
I'm here to ID you and your
fucking bomb for a strike team.

57:47.259 --> 57:48.894
You're bluffing.

57:48.928 --> 57:50.563
Try me.

57:50.595 --> 57:52.932
I already planted the GPS.

57:56.268 --> 57:58.737
Yeah, you're right.

57:58.771 --> 58:00.739
I'm going to kill you right now.

58:00.773 --> 58:04.110
Kill me asshole. I'm the only
one who knows where it is.

58:04.143 --> 58:06.278
Come to think of it.

58:06.312 --> 58:09.115
The birds are already
on their way.

58:09.148 --> 58:11.450
Rodin,
you need to see this.

58:11.484 --> 58:13.285
Hold on.

58:13.319 --> 58:16.422
I will be there in a minute.

58:16.455 --> 58:19.425
Nikola, make him talk.

58:24.463 --> 58:27.133
Yes, yes!

58:51.991 --> 58:53.692
Come on, come on.

58:57.496 --> 58:58.464
This is Legion One...

58:58.497 --> 59:00.132
unsecured in
an emergency frequency...

59:00.166 --> 59:02.334
for any U.S Military
forces in range, over.

59:02.368 --> 59:04.136
Legion One, this a submarine.

59:04.170 --> 59:05.639
Listen, I need
General Anderson, fast!

59:05.671 --> 59:07.306
Sir, this is a
non-secure frequency

59:07.339 --> 59:09.141
Put it on your report,
go for Anderson.

59:09.175 --> 59:10.342
General, this is Coop.

59:10.376 --> 59:13.179
The device and the target
on the train 290 out of Golyama.

59:13.212 --> 59:15.481
1400 hours today,
destination... unknown.

59:15.514 --> 59:18.484
Train 290, out of
Golyama, 1400, copy.

59:18.517 --> 59:19.985
I have one critically
wounded sailor

59:20.019 --> 59:22.656
and one with a GSW non-critical.
I need emergency pickup.

59:22.688 --> 59:23.889
Where's Cutter?

59:23.923 --> 59:26.660
Cutter's on the train, sir.
He wanted to finish the mission.

59:26.692 --> 59:29.695
We're coming to get you, Cooper.
Hang tight.

59:29.728 --> 59:31.997
Get me NATO, I need an immediate
strike readied.

59:32.031 --> 59:34.668
We need two
interceptors for train 290.

59:34.700 --> 59:36.001
But, sir, Cutter's
still on board...

59:36.035 --> 59:38.672
And so is that bomb.

59:38.704 --> 59:42.174
Switch our tracks over
in the next intersection.

59:42.208 --> 59:44.543
Sir, that's extremely dangerous.

59:44.577 --> 59:47.012
We just shut down
the entire system...

59:47.046 --> 59:49.683
it's a single track of railroad.

59:49.715 --> 59:52.851
Coming the other way could
be 10,000 tons of steel.

59:52.885 --> 59:55.888
Exactly. Or, 1,000 pounds
of high explosive

59:55.921 --> 59:58.857
courtesy of
the United States Air Force.

59:58.891 --> 01:00:02.728
One is a maybe.
The other... indefinitely.

01:00:30.422 --> 01:00:32.925
Hello? Train number 70?

01:00:40.432 --> 01:00:41.735
Hello?!

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.437
Hello? Train number 70?

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:55.749
Where is the GPS?

01:00:59.285 --> 01:01:00.252
Tell us!

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.422
Tell us you American
piece of shit.

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:08.427
You tell us!

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.764
Why did I leave her?

01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:14.266
She said I cared more
about my unit.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.436
She said I would
give my last breath.

01:01:17.469 --> 01:01:18.937
She was right!

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:13.660
What the hell is happening?

01:02:13.693 --> 01:02:14.860
I don't know sir.

01:02:14.893 --> 01:02:17.831
The truck was diverted
to an outside command

01:02:17.863 --> 01:02:19.331
and then the system crashed.

01:02:19.365 --> 01:02:20.599
Can't contact them?

01:02:20.633 --> 01:02:24.671
Negative sir. I tried, but it is
an old train and no one answers.

01:02:24.704 --> 01:02:26.840
What about 2-9-0?

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:28.374
I don't know.
They don't receive,

01:02:28.407 --> 01:02:29.843
I think the signal is cut.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.343
Call the army,

01:02:31.377 --> 01:02:33.011
see if someone
can get a helicopter

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:34.346
with a loudspeaker there.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.850
Sir, I don't think
it's a good idea,

01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:39.686
because there is
a bomb on the train.

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:42.388
Don't argue with me,

01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.189
you imbecile.

01:02:44.223 --> 01:02:45.692
Do it!

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.148
Sir?

01:04:18.016 --> 01:04:20.319
Bullets hit the pipes.
We need to slow down.

01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:23.355
Slow down for nothing.

01:05:34.928 --> 01:05:36.696
Stand up!

01:05:36.729 --> 01:05:39.866
Receive Jesus Christ
as your Light and Saviour.

01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:41.034
Fuck off!

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:43.368
What is troubling
your soul my son?

01:05:43.402 --> 01:05:45.404
You need to clear
your conscience.

01:05:45.437 --> 01:05:46.873
Get back to your seat.

01:05:46.906 --> 01:05:48.875
I want to bring your
lost soul to Jesus.

01:05:48.908 --> 01:05:50.075
I'll fucking kill you.

01:05:50.108 --> 01:05:52.210
And I will rise from the dead.

01:05:58.952 --> 01:06:01.219
Repent sinners.

01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:06.759
You're going to get a medal.

01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:09.062
Yes, if I leave.

01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:10.596
I need a phone.

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.076
John, is this you?

01:06:23.108 --> 01:06:24.911
For God's sake,
stop the train.

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:26.913
Yeah, I'd love to pall, no dice.

01:06:26.946 --> 01:06:27.747
Jesus!

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.247
Did you reach General Anderson?

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:30.917
Not yet. John you are

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.251
on a collision course
with another train.

01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:34.453
How long do we have?

01:06:34.486 --> 01:06:35.922
About eight minutes!

01:06:35.955 --> 01:06:38.423
I need you to contact
General Anderson

01:06:38.457 --> 01:06:39.759
through the codes I gave you.

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:40.793
Tell him the bomb
is on this train.

01:06:40.827 --> 01:06:44.262
Do you understand?

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:47.934
We're on a collision course
with another train.

01:06:47.967 --> 01:06:50.103
I need to disconnect the cars.
How do we do it?

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:51.303
I can show you how to do it.

01:06:51.336 --> 01:06:52.304
Good.

01:06:52.337 --> 01:06:54.306
First I have some
unfinished business.

01:07:09.154 --> 01:07:11.156
No, no, no! No shooting!

01:07:11.189 --> 01:07:12.125
Drop it!

01:07:12.157 --> 01:07:13.960
Please, no shooting!

01:07:13.993 --> 01:07:17.162
One ricochet and we will die.

01:07:19.032 --> 01:07:22.001
Please. No shooting.
Please!

01:07:26.005 --> 01:07:27.172
Okay.

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:32.872
This is General Anderson.

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.907
It's for you.

01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:36.374
NATO headquarters.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.542
It's about time.

01:08:39.946 --> 01:08:41.546
Sir, yes sir.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.381
Boris, this is General Anderson.

01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:46.251
Yes, Captain Tamesh, sir.

01:08:46.283 --> 01:08:48.553
I have a message for
you from John Cutter.

01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:51.256
The bomb
and the target are on the train.

01:08:51.288 --> 01:08:52.892
I know that captain.

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:56.261
The question is,
where is the train?

01:08:56.294 --> 01:08:57.562
The train diverted west.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:01.399
It's approximately 10 km
from border with Monte Negro.

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:02.734
Approximately?

01:09:02.769 --> 01:09:05.904
Our command control sir,
is malfunctioning.

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:06.773
Jesus!

01:09:06.805 --> 01:09:09.407
And sir, another thing.
Very important.

01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:12.245
The train 2-9-0
is on a collision

01:09:12.277 --> 01:09:14.247
course with another train,

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.782
Steam train from Croatia.

01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:18.785
Thank you Captain.

01:09:18.818 --> 01:09:22.255
Find me that goddamn train.

01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:43.975
Hey!

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:45.778
Sorry I didn't make
an appointment.

01:09:45.812 --> 01:09:47.279
What the hell is it with you?

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:50.950
A personal crusade
to stop me making any money?

01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:53.286
Maybe you should
find a new profession.

01:09:53.318 --> 01:09:55.788
Murder and kidnapping don't seem
to be working out too well.

01:09:55.822 --> 01:09:58.456
It's easy for you to say.
You're a young man.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:02.995
You know how hard it is
to change careers in middle age.

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:07.633
Tell me.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:09.168
What do you want from me?

01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:11.170
I want you to die.

01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:24.317
Listen!

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:26.152
Once the bomb is delivered,

01:10:26.185 --> 01:10:29.155
I make one hundred
million dollars.

01:10:29.188 --> 01:10:31.023
Just name your price.

01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:35.527
Half and half.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.331
That's a fuck load of money.

01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:40.532
Are you offering
me a partnership?

01:10:40.565 --> 01:10:43.501
Oh no man.
I already have partners.

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:45.503
You know them.

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:49.008
It's uncle Sam, CIA,

01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:51.677
Roland E. Anderson,

01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:54.379
E. stands for Elliot.

01:10:54.412 --> 01:10:56.514
What are you talking about?

01:10:56.548 --> 01:11:00.186
Lieutenant, we are working
for the same people,

01:11:00.219 --> 01:11:03.756
the only difference is,
I am making much more money.

01:11:12.265 --> 01:11:13.900
Hold on!

01:11:24.243 --> 01:11:26.045
I think we got a
little stand-off here.

01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:28.080
No one has to die.

01:11:28.114 --> 01:11:30.883
One month ago,
I had a contract with CIA.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:33.219
They highjacked the scientist,

01:11:33.252 --> 01:11:36.722
But later some whistleblower
opened his mouth

01:11:36.756 --> 01:11:40.393
and now the US government
wants to shut me down forever.

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:43.930
I need an insurance policy.
The bomb.

01:11:43.963 --> 01:11:47.565
No one will fuck me up
when this toy is ready.

01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:50.435
US government doesn't deal
with terrorist.

01:11:50.468 --> 01:11:52.238
Come on man.

01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:55.274
All the criminals and
terrorists all over the world,

01:11:55.308 --> 01:11:58.244
have had a business
with the CIA.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:02.415
On Monday they need us,
on Tuesday they train us,

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:04.417
On Wednesday they use us,

01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:07.420
by Friday we are
terrorists again.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:09.422
We are all from the same school!

01:12:09.454 --> 01:12:10.588
I don't care!

01:12:26.504 --> 01:12:29.141
He's using us both.

01:13:16.554 --> 01:13:18.691
We still can make a deal.

01:13:18.724 --> 01:13:22.161
Here's the deal. You die.

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:24.030
I came here to make
the world safer,

01:13:24.063 --> 01:13:27.500
but now I£m here for... Frank!

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:28.834
Russ,

01:13:28.868 --> 01:13:30.369
Dan,

01:13:30.403 --> 01:13:32.505
and Joe!

01:13:50.555 --> 01:13:52.091
All units,
take positions.

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:06.072
Welcome home Cooper.

01:14:06.105 --> 01:14:07.873
You heard from Mr. Cutter sir?

01:14:07.907 --> 01:14:09.075
Not yet.

01:14:09.108 --> 01:14:10.376
I hope he makes it.

01:14:10.409 --> 01:14:11.077
It looks like there's
going to be

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.711
a collision with the other train

01:14:12.745 --> 01:14:15.214
and I don't think there's a
damn think we can do about it.

01:14:15.247 --> 01:14:16.749
We have to do something.

01:14:18.616 --> 01:14:21.720
I'm trying son.

01:14:21.754 --> 01:14:25.224
That man saved our
asses back there.

01:14:25.257 --> 01:14:28.294
So with all due respect,
try harder.

01:14:31.596 --> 01:14:33.265
Stand down sailor.

01:14:46.946 --> 01:14:48.447
Can you disarm the bomb?

01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:51.616
No, not if Gregor finished it.

01:15:02.128 --> 01:15:03.629
Focus on the bomb Nina.

01:15:10.469 --> 01:15:12.605
Gregor has installed
three triggers.

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:15.441
The timer, remote
detonator, accelerator.

01:15:15.474 --> 01:15:16.275
What's that?

01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:17.943
If the bomb is moved too fast,

01:15:17.977 --> 01:15:19.278
Like if the trains crashes?

01:15:19.311 --> 01:15:21.447
We are all going to
die if we crash.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.116
We all die if I
tamper the device,

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:27.453
or interrupt the circuits.

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:28.487
Unless...

01:15:28.521 --> 01:15:29.655
Unless?

01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:33.292
I can depressurise
the oxygen tanks,

01:15:33.325 --> 01:15:36.495
that will slow down
the main ,

01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:39.798
and if I'm right, it will help
switch off the entire system.

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:41.635
There won't be a bomb anymore.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:42.301
Exactly!

01:15:42.334 --> 01:15:43.637
What are you waiting for?

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:44.638
I never did it before.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:45.639
Jesus...

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:50.309
I can try, but if I fail,
millions will die.

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:53.312
We don't have a choice.
Good luck Nina.

01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:55.681
Be cool.
Be outta here in a few minutes.

01:15:57.716 --> 01:16:02.188
Okay, I will start draining
the fuel tanks.

01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:09.328
Warning!
Three minutes to collision!

01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:11.530
Three minutes to collision!

01:16:31.584 --> 01:16:34.853
Damn it, what the hell?!

01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:36.889
Get me some leverage!

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.208
Warning!

01:16:56.242 --> 01:16:58.377
You are two minutes
from collision!

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:01.880
You are two

01:17:32.278 --> 01:17:34.446
One minute to collision!

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.448
One minute to collision!

01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:55.434
Warning!
Thirty seconds to collision!

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.469
Thirty seconds to collision!

01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:43.482
I knew you could do it.

01:19:33.932 --> 01:19:35.567
Hi ma'am.

01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:37.035
Hi.

01:19:37.069 --> 01:19:39.204
I am a friend of John Cutter.

01:19:39.238 --> 01:19:41.373
Really? John Cutter?

01:19:41.407 --> 01:19:43.375
He told me to come
here and find Jenna.

01:19:43.409 --> 01:19:46.245
Said you might have
a dog of his in your home.

01:19:46.278 --> 01:19:48.213
Can't have my dog Coop!

01:19:48.247 --> 01:19:51.383
John! Jesus Christ man,
I thought you were dead!

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:52.418
That was the idea.

01:19:53.585 --> 01:19:54.586
Good to see you bud!

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:56.555
Yeah, man.

01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.891
Hey baby!

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:58.758
Hi!

01:20:05.964 --> 01:20:07.599
Heard Nick and
Pink both made it.

01:20:07.634 --> 01:20:09.234
They did.

01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:11.236
Thanks for coming up Coop.

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:12.404
It means a lot.

01:20:12.438 --> 01:20:14.406
You did pretty good
for a ground hunter.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.275
I'd go to war with you anytime.

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:20.579
How is General Anderson?

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:23.081
You know, he's a big hero now.

01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:25.284
Probably gonna run
for presidency.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.462
I don't think he will.

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:40.265
What you got there?

01:20:40.299 --> 01:20:44.470
You know, broken promises,
lies, murder.

01:20:59.351 --> 01:21:02.689
Jenna? Any chance two thirsty
men can get a couple?

01:21:04.657 --> 01:21:06.158
My girl!

01:21:08.527 --> 01:21:11.163
To all our fallen brothers.

01:21:47.454 --> 01:21:52.454
