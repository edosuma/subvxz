nobody's been working.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.128
No, that sounds real good.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.264
Well, n-- well, tha--

01:03.364 --> 01:04.532
thanks, yeah.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.966
No, I'm here all day.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.401
Yeah, yeah, give me
a call as soon as you

01:07.501 --> 01:08.702
find out something for sure.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.838
OK, man, thanks a lot, bye-bye.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.005
Whoo!

01:12.106 --> 01:13.807
All right, your old
man's going back to work.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.243
Did Dwight get a job for you?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.377
Maybe.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.545
He's pretty sure
he's got something

01:17.645 --> 01:18.912
lined up for the Stamford bill.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.648
Some guy wants his
kitchen remodelled,

01:20.748 --> 01:22.082
it'll be a couple
of weeks' work.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.851
He's going to call me back
as soon as it's definite.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.620
Great, maybe I can finally
get you out of this house.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.957
DAN CONNER: [singing]
You're going to miss me.

01:30.057 --> 01:33.161
Ari, ari, ari.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.928
So will that sofa.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.997
You know, the only thing you've
been doing for the last two

01:37.097 --> 01:39.400
weeks is just lying
there, watching TV,

01:39.500 --> 01:40.701
and buffing out your nails.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.038
How do they look?

01:54.248 --> 01:57.518
Quit bothering me!

01:57.618 --> 02:00.821
Get back in there and
fix your four-star chili.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.090
You only married
me for my cooking.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.058
A-aah.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.994
I married you, because you
needed a date for your wedding.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.901
ROSEANNE CONNER: So when
is this chili masterpiece

02:14.001 --> 02:14.802

02:17.438 --> 02:19.039
Well, make sure you
make enough for Jackie.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.245
She's coming over?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.880
Honey, doesn't she come
over every single Saturday?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.149
Yeah, I was just thinking
maybe she'd miss a day.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.153
You knew, when you married
me, that I had a sister.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.489
Yeah, well, I didn't think
she'd be here every weekend.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.625
Oh, hell, I didn't think
I'd be here every weekend.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.429
You know, if she
had a life of her own,

02:41.529 --> 02:43.631
she wouldn't have to ruin mine.

02:43.731 --> 02:47.100
I'm telling you, honey, 2
minutes after she walks in--

02:47.201 --> 02:48.001
put those

02:48.101 --> 02:50.271
down.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.171
DAN CONNER: Put those down.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.142
ROSEANNE CONNER: [laughing] Ay!

02:59.713 --> 03:00.548
Ay!

03:00.648 --> 03:01.449
Drop them.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.350
OK.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.685
Good, anyway.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.053
Where was I?

03:06.153 --> 03:08.756
2 minutes after she
walks through that door,

03:08.856 --> 03:11.091
she's going to say, Dan, you
know what your problem is?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.026
Dan, you know what
your problem is?

03:13.126 --> 03:14.862
Oh, don't start?

03:14.962 --> 03:17.030
I hear that one more time, I'm
going to tie her to that chair

03:17.130 --> 03:20.234
and make her watch 15
years of our home movies.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.470
Well, that is the cruelest
thing you've ever said,

03:22.570 --> 03:23.371
you beast.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.414
Dan, what's wrong?

me have a taste.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.305
You invited her to dinner?

03:57.405 --> 03:58.406
Not yet.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.374
Jackie, honey, why don't
you stay for dinner?

04:00.474 --> 04:01.809
Thank you.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.513
That'll be convenient, since
I am spending the night.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.520
Yeah, the pipes in my
apartment froze again,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.588
I don't have any water.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.556
I can get some water to go.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.460
Dan, you know what
your problem is?

04:21.895 --> 04:23.464
Do you want me to set
up the projector now?

04:26.467 --> 04:28.101
You don't put enough
pepper in the chili.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.443
I happen to put the perfect
amount of peppers in my chili.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.845
So bland.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.279
Rosie, is my chili too bland?

04:39.380 --> 04:43.016
Absolutely not, your chili is
just like you, hot and spicy.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.821
Hey, Jackie.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.722
Hi, sweetheart.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.790
What are you looking at?

04:49.890 --> 04:50.958

04:51.058 --> 04:52.059
Oh, my god.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.261
Roseanne, do you remember that?
- Oh, yeah.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.996
We used to read all
those articles about how

04:56.096 --> 04:57.431
to be the perfect woman.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.066
Yeah, those were great.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.502
Oh, my favorite one
was "50 Ways to Say I

05:01.602 --> 05:03.270

in here about how to read

05:07.475 --> 05:08.976
your boyfriend's body language.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.345
Well, if your boyfriend's
body starts talking,

05:11.445 --> 05:12.279
I want to know about it.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.916
I happen to know quite
a bit about body language.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.250
Yeah?

05:17.351 --> 05:18.251
Tell your body to go home.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.152

words are saying go home,

saying that he loves

05:30.130 --> 05:33.133
and adores his sister-in-law.

on the counter, who took it?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.716
Not me, soda phantom.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.050
Oh, you mean this?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.919
What are you doing?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.053
I was drinking that.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.388
Sorry, here.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.289
I'm not going to drink it,
if you slobbered all over it.

Careful, dad.

Getting bigger,
getting bigger!

06:10.671 --> 06:11.572
Cut it out.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.906
Get back to the
kitchen there and spice

06:13.006 --> 06:15.042
up that bland chili of yours.

and you can insult my children,

Can you hand me glue?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.155
You guys are
doing really good.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.090
I know, I'm in
charge of the glue.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.792
You know what
you need, though?

06:31.892 --> 06:32.926
Uh?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.696
Look in the picture,
you need a drawbridge.

me in peace of wood that big.

And don't move
your fingers, it's

washing machine is free.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.120
OK, thanks.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.790
Why, you're really putting
in some time on this.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.657
Yeah, I know.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.158
It must be important.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.361
Nah, not really.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.797
Just for fun.

07:09.897 --> 07:13.000
Well, let me tell you
a story just for fun.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.267
No, not a story!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.138
Once upon a time there was a--

07:18.238 --> 07:19.773
Once upon a time there
was this little girl

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
who ran away from home,
because her mother

07:21.675 --> 07:22.876
told her long, boring stories.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.379
Shut up, you.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.449
Once upon a time that
was a beautiful queen,

07:29.550 --> 07:32.520
and she lived in a
beautiful palace.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.056
And she had a beautiful
and lovely little daughter,

07:36.156 --> 07:36.957
and her name was--

07:37.057 --> 07:40.694
Let me guess, mom, Darlene.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
No, smart mouth,
it was Darlena.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.035
Anyway, the beautiful
queen was puzzled,

07:48.135 --> 07:51.539
and she asked Darlena, "Why
are thou building this thing?"

07:54.307 --> 07:57.945
And Darlena replied,
"Don't try and figure it out,

07:58.045 --> 07:58.946
just live with it."

08:01.014 --> 08:02.950
What is this all
about, Darlene?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.618
What?

08:04.718 --> 08:08.055
Level with me.

08:08.155 --> 08:15.162
[sighs] Mom, uh,
I'm flunking history.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.164
Uh-huh.

08:17.264 --> 08:22.069
Well, Crane said that if I
did this castle for extra credit

08:22.169 --> 08:26.173
and did OK on the next
test, I might pass.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.575
Uh-huh.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.812
Well, so that's why I've
got to get this in by Monday.

08:31.912 --> 08:35.749
Hmm, well, then I'm going
to let you get back to work.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.117
Wait, aren't you
going to yell at me?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.418
No.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.953
Well, aren't you going
to tell me how bright

08:40.053 --> 08:41.689
I am, but I never
apply myself and always

08:41.789 --> 08:43.691
wait till the last minute?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.425
You don't need to
hear that again, do you?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.898
[theme music]

08:55.502 --> 08:57.104
Yeah, I went out
with him on Friday.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.372
Yeah, I hadn't told
you that, right.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.241
So I was going to go out
with him again on Saturday,

09:01.341 --> 09:02.910
and then I find out
he went to Chicago.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.311
I find out from Billy.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.947
Right, I have no way to
get in touch with him,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.082
so I call his apartment, I leave
message on the machine, right.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.051
I had nothing to say,
I'm like hi, how are you?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.319
You know, it's me.
If you need--

09:12.419 --> 09:13.854
Jackie, are you going to
stay on the phone all day?

09:13.954 --> 09:14.988
Hold on just a second.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.324
Yeah, I'm going to be
off in just a second.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.458
So I leave the
message, you know.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.093
And then how am I
supposed to get in touch

09:20.193 --> 09:21.461
with him in Chicago anyway?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.030
Would you please
hurry up, I'm expecting

09:23.130 --> 09:24.865
a very important phone call.
- Hold on.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.199
You know what your
problem is, Dan?

09:27.768 --> 09:28.936
You don't have call waiting.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.339
You know what your
problem is, Jackie?

09:32.439 --> 09:35.242
You don't pay my phone bill.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.444
OK, the phone's all yours.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.446
Thank you for allowing
me to use my telephone.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.585
I don't want to complain.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.654
But you're going to.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.888
Roseanne, when
you were growing up,

09:47.988 --> 09:49.056
how did you live with her?

09:49.156 --> 09:50.590
Why, we just locked
her up in the closet,

09:50.691 --> 09:52.893
and then we stuffed some
dog food under the door.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.064
She is a major league
pain in the butt.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.032
Yeah, but, you know,
you're really spoiled,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.468
because, you know, you live with
me, you're used to perfection.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.270
[phone ringing]

10:03.370 --> 10:05.305
Oh, there it is,
come on, Dwight.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.206
Hello.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.643
Hey, Dwight, what's the word?

10:09.743 --> 10:12.312
Yeah, thanks anyway.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.947
Yeah, maybe next week.

10:14.047 --> 10:14.948
Right, bye-bye.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.288
Damn.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.957
You are going to get the
very next job that comes.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.226
I hope so, I'm
going nuts, sitting

10:26.326 --> 10:28.195
around here for two weeks.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.563
Yeah, but I kind of
like having you around.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.799
Well, I kind of
like being around,

10:31.899 --> 10:34.434
but I feel terrible
when I ain't working.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.502
Well, you want work?

10:35.602 --> 10:37.437
Because, you know,
over the Blue Flamingo

10:37.537 --> 10:38.806
they're hiring topless dancers.

10:41.709 --> 10:45.713
Nah, I couldn't do
that with my bad knee.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.116
Well, I'd put a
dollar in your g-string.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.283
Go get your purse.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.158
Mom, dad, come
on, gotta try this.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.528
There's a test in the
back of this "Teenage Life,"

11:01.628 --> 11:04.431
and you guys are going to
be our lovebird guinea pigs.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.166
[interposing voices]
- --play no game.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.100
Oh, come on.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.035
Come on, dad, please.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.469
Are we going to
do anything weird?

11:09.569 --> 11:10.370
You wish.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.105
Just do it, dad.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.506
- All right.
- Come on.

11:13.606 --> 11:14.407
Sit.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.575
You sit, you sit.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.476
Now.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.410
[groaning]

11:17.510 --> 11:19.412
All right, lay
this game on us.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.483
Exercise one,
tantalizing with a touch.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.752
Oh, I think, I'm
going to like this.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.154
JACKIE (GIGGLING): The
object of this exercise

11:27.254 --> 11:31.158
is to transmit a deeply felt
emotion with your hands.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.692
Now, Jackie, this is corny.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.494
JACKIE HARRIS: Roseanne.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.231
Oh, all right, all
right, OK, I could do it.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.632
[slapping]

11:41.634 --> 11:43.070
Come on, guys.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.106
You know, this really could
help your relationship.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.207
Be serious.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.541
OK, I'm serious.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.542
Are you serious?

11:49.642 --> 11:50.443
I'm serious.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.479
OK, we're serious.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.614
All right, face--
OK, uh, I see.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.818
Face your boyfriend
and touch hands.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.221
Yeah, but my boyfriend's
not here, will my husband do?

12:01.321 --> 12:02.489
He will have to do.

12:02.589 --> 12:07.560
Now, try to communicate an
emotion without speaking.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.528
OK.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.530
OK, he'll be wrong,
I just know it.

12:12.365 --> 12:16.636
OK, dad, what's mom thinking?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.005
She's thinking I'll be wrong.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.409
This is great, Dan, we never
have to talk to each other

12:22.509 --> 12:23.310
again.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.577
[clapping and cheering]

12:25.578 --> 12:27.280
Oh, come on, you two.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.683
[clears throat]
Come on, try it again.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.987
OK, OK, OK, I got it, OK.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.156
I'm transmitting in a
very important message

12:36.256 --> 12:39.827
here, so tune in loverboy.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.929
Oh, I'm picking something up.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.965
All right, Dan, what's
she trying to tell you?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.633
She's telling me
something I wanted

12:46.733 --> 12:49.036
to hear for a real long time.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.670
My sister-in-law's moving
to the North Dakota.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.209
Dad.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.011
I'm sorry, Jackie, that
was a joke, South Dakota.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.683
Sometimes there's a
lot of truth in kidding.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.786
Oh, hell, don't
psychoanalyze everything I say.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.989
Believe me, it's not worth it.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.223
No, Dan, I want to know.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.758
Do I irritate you?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.393
I don't-- I don't
want to get into this.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.661
No, really.
ROSEANNE: [sighing]

13:14.761 --> 13:15.996
Where do I begin?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.764
You don't.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.367
- At the beginning.
- OK.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.601
One thing, you pick
all the nuts out

13:21.701 --> 13:23.470
of the Rocky Road ice cream.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.739
Well, put me in front
of a firing squad.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.009
I'm going to put you both
in front of a firing squad.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.377
Well, another thing,
you could knock,

13:30.477 --> 13:31.478
when you walk in the door.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.013
You want me to knock
when I come over?

13:33.113 --> 13:33.580
I would love
for you to knock--

13:33.680 --> 13:34.547
I could knock--

13:34.647 --> 13:35.548
--when you walk
in the door, please.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.149
--if that's what
you want me to do

13:36.249 --> 13:36.950
Fine!
Fine!

13:37.050 --> 13:37.517
--next time.
[clanking]

13:37.617 --> 13:38.618
chili is ready!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.254
Come on, Dan, spit it out.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.455
What's really bothering you?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.057
What's really bother
me, Jackie, is that you're

13:44.157 --> 13:45.325
over here all the time.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.560
Well, Dan, if
you had a job, you

13:47.660 --> 13:49.029
wouldn't even notice so much.

14:03.877 --> 14:04.777
[doors slams]

14:07.814 --> 14:10.884
Gosh, you certainly must
come over more often, sis.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.190
[theme music]

14:21.694 --> 14:23.730
Well, Dan really
went off the deep end.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.165
Oh, you think so?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.466
You know, he just lost a job.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.002
That was the phone call
he was waiting for.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.003
Oh.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.404
I don't know how
you do it, Jackie,

14:31.504 --> 14:33.840
but you always manage to
say the most perfectly

14:33.941 --> 14:37.777
wrongest thing at the most
perfectly wrongest time, just

14:37.877 --> 14:39.346
like mom.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.481
Well, OK, take his side.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.017
Oh, there you go, that's two.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.986
That is the most
perfectly wrongest

14:46.086 --> 14:47.754
thing you could've said to me.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.622
Why don't you think
before you talk?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.491
So you expect me to go out
there and apologize to him.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.393
No, I don't expect
you to do nothing.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.494
That's what you want me to do.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.029
I'm not going to
tell you what to do.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.364
Why not?

14:57.464 --> 14:58.898
You're going to tell me what
to do anyway, just like mom.

14:58.999 --> 14:59.832
That's three.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.838
He has been on my case ever
since I came in the door.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.575
And I'm not apologizing to
him until he apologizes to me.

15:16.049 --> 15:16.916
Mom?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.118
What?

15:18.218 --> 15:20.853
Are dad and aunt Jackie
really mad at each other?

15:20.954 --> 15:23.423
No, they just fight
for the same reason

15:23.523 --> 15:26.093
you fight with
Darlene, to torture me.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.364
DARLENE: DJ, look what you did.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.733
Mom!

15:33.833 --> 15:35.802
Look what you did,
you ruined it.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.204
I didn't mean to!

15:37.304 --> 15:38.238
You're so stupid!

15:42.042 --> 15:43.376
What happened?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.213
DJ fell on my
castle and crushed it.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.148
- We can fix it.
- No, we can't.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.151
Now I'm going to flunk history
and it's all DJ's fault.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.919
Oh, it's DJ's fault.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.921
Yes, look what he did.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.457
Oh, yeah it's definitely
his fault that you

15:57.557 --> 15:59.326
didn't study all semester.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.128
But mom, he was
just here and--

16:01.228 --> 16:02.662
Yeah, and it's his
fault that you put

16:02.762 --> 16:04.464
this off till the last minute.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.698
You always take his side.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.167
I'm not taking his side.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.235
Yes, you are.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.602
You're stricter to
aunt Becky, but you

16:09.702 --> 16:11.604
let DJ to get away with murder.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.973
Darlene, who are
you really mad at?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.042
DJ.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.443
Yeah, well, that
makes a lot of sense.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.511
I know if I'd screwed
around all semester

16:18.611 --> 16:21.581
and was flunking history, I'd
sure be looking for somebody

16:21.681 --> 16:23.216
else to blame it on, too.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.817
That's not what I'm doing.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.220
That's exactly what
you're doing, Darlene.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.188
It's not fair.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.362
DJ.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.932
Come on down here, honey.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.234
Is Darlene there?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.303
No, she's gone.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.304
It's safe, come on down.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.177
Looks like you
really redecorated

16:50.277 --> 16:51.578
Darlene's castle there.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.580
I didn't mean to.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.216
Hm, I know it was an accident.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.085
Darlene hates me.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.086
She doesn't hate you, honey.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.453
She hates history.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.689
She said I was stupid.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.359
No, you're not stupid, you're
just clumsy like your daddy.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.329
Yeah, right.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.730
Do you want to
go in the kitchen

17:10.830 --> 17:12.865
and be my official chili taster?

17:12.965 --> 17:14.901
No.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.336
You're just going to
sit here on the steps

17:16.436 --> 17:17.637
for the rest of your life?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.038
Yep.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.709
And let people walk on you and
pile up books on you and junk?

17:22.809 --> 17:23.676
Yep.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.978
Well, that ain't
much of a life,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.114
but I'll help you
to get started.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.418
Come here.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.389
Put this on.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.390
I give you a hat.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.894
[dj laughs]

17:41.994 --> 17:43.396
[roseanne laughs]

17:43.496 --> 17:46.866
[theme music]

17:46.966 --> 17:49.068
Mom, should I put this
other load in the dryer?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.637
No, I'll do it in a minute.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.738
Giddy up, giddy up.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.077
OK, horsie, get up here.

17:58.178 --> 18:02.014
Whoo, ah!

18:02.115 --> 18:03.716
Mom, I finished
folding the laundry.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.684
Thank you, honey.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.386
You're one of my
three favorite kids.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.122
What about me?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.022
No.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.301
Are you ready for, uh,
some delicious chili?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.502
Yep.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.304
OK, you're ready
for the greatest

18:24.404 --> 18:26.038
chili in the entire world?

18:26.139 --> 18:26.939
Yep.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.375
All right, here you go.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.343
[crunch]

18:35.448 --> 18:36.483
Just a little bit bland.

18:45.525 --> 18:51.164
Man, this garage is a mess,
I've got to get organized.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.532
Dad, can I use this?

18:52.632 --> 18:56.369
No, I need that, me,
myself and I, many a man.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.575
[clack]

19:02.675 --> 19:04.076
What are you doing?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.212
Getting some more wood.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.013
So you are going
to fix that castle?

19:07.113 --> 19:12.151
Yeah, but it's
still DJ's fault.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.955
Gosh, Darlene is
so doggone stubborn.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.457
I wonder where she gets it from.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.393
Not from me.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.162
No, it couldn't be from you.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.398
Roseanne, I know
what you're doing.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.334
There is no way I'm
going to go in there

19:27.434 --> 19:28.701
and apologize to your sister.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.738
Um, I just thought I'd
let you know that I'm

19:31.838 --> 19:33.840
going to go check into a motel.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.841
Anybody we know?

19:37.444 --> 19:39.779
I just think it'd be better
if I stayed somewhere else.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.448
How about the Philippines?

19:41.548 --> 19:42.682
You know what your
problem is, Dan?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.050
Yeah, you.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.718
See, I come in here and
try to make things easy,

19:45.818 --> 19:47.887
he's acting like a big baby.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.823
Would you tell your sister,
it takes one to know one?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.392
I don't know how you
get along with this guy.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.526
This is a game I know.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.160
You can tell your
sister to hit the bricks.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.228
I know this game.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.596
I really know this
game, it's called

19:56.696 --> 19:58.898
let's tear Roseanne apart.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.800
You take this arm and
you take this arm,

20:00.900 --> 20:06.639
and then you just pull, pull
until I splatter into a puddle.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.708
(SIGHING) She's over
here all the time,

20:08.808 --> 20:10.243
because she's my sister.

20:10.343 --> 20:15.214
And he don't mean nothing, he's
just blowing off steam, OK?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.584
Now, you two are worse
than all three of the kids

20:17.684 --> 20:19.886
put together, you're
driving me nuts.

20:19.986 --> 20:20.887
You've got to get it together.

20:25.692 --> 20:33.766
[door slams]

20:33.866 --> 20:35.902
Well, you don't--

20:36.002 --> 20:38.805
you don't have to stay
in a motel, that's silly.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.906
You can sleep out here.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.047
She's really something.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.816
Yeah, well, she does get
carried away sometimes.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.618
Yeah, and she loves to
tell everybody exactly

20:51.718 --> 20:52.985
how to lead their lives.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.787
Yeah, well, that's because
she thinks she knows everything.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.888
Well, I do.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.257
[theme music]

20:58.358 --> 20:59.759
[imitating scream]

21:01.361 --> 21:04.764
[music playing on tv]

21:09.869 --> 21:12.372
Dan, ain't that
movie over yet?

21:12.472 --> 21:13.272
No.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.610
I want to go to sleep.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.946
Please, this is the
best part of the movie.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.781
Come on, you're on my bed.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.450
Jackie, your bed is my sofa.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.419
Here you go, sis.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.455
Dan won't get off the couch.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.357
Honey, get off the couch.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.592
Shh, getting ready
for the showdown.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.694
[music playing on tv]

21:38.698 --> 21:42.802
[flopping]

21:42.902 --> 21:43.703
[rumbling]

21:43.803 --> 21:44.904
[laughing]

21:53.680 --> 21:54.113
