00:10.328 --> 00:12.327
(Thunder crashes)

00:25.078 --> 00:27.317
(Dramatic music)

00:42.627 --> 00:44.786
(Engine revs)

01:05.932 --> 01:07.931
(Music fades)

01:12.048 --> 01:15.046
(Vehicle approaches)

01:22.601 --> 01:24.840
(Quiet dramatic music)

01:35.513 --> 01:37.991
(Heavy, rapid breathing)

01:44.827 --> 01:46.826
(Door opens)

02:03.455 --> 02:05.613
(Moans quietly)

02:18.605 --> 02:21.123
(Eerie music)

02:53.502 --> 02:55.501
(Sean)
Leave it!

03:00.498 --> 03:02.537
You can't even look at it,
can you?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.970
You know how Elliot got to him.

03:15.448 --> 03:17.447
Don't lie to me, Mum.

03:19.006 --> 03:21.005
This is about Billy now.

03:22.604 --> 03:25.142
What did you do? Tell the truth.

03:25.242 --> 03:27.361
Billy found Asif's shipment.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.858
And you couldn't tell me
because you're the one who stole it?

03:30.958 --> 03:32.697
I never meant
for Billy to get hurt!

03:32.797 --> 03:34.776
And you say that
with his fucking arm lying there!

03:34.876 --> 03:36.495
I was protecting him. And you!

03:36.595 --> 03:38.253
- Protecting us!
- From Koba!

03:38.353 --> 03:40.372
I had to take control
because you can't.

03:40.472 --> 03:43.290
No, no, no, no, no. You just
couldn't bear to see me win.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.809
I didn't need you.
That's what you couldn't stomach.

03:45.909 --> 03:48.247
Sean, we need
to pull together now.

03:48.347 --> 03:50.126
- If Elliot phones, don't answer.
- What?

03:50.226 --> 03:52.364
You're not doing what he says.
He'll kill...

03:52.464 --> 03:55.562
I'm going to save my brother.

03:55.662 --> 03:58.480
Sean! Listen!
He'll kill the both of you, please!

03:58.580 --> 04:00.599
Listen to what I'm saying!
He'll kill the both of you.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.718
- I'm getting Billy.
- Oh, just forget Billy!

04:02.818 --> 04:04.357
Billy's gone.

04:04.457 --> 04:06.615
(Sean yells)

04:09.813 --> 04:10.912
(Chokes)

04:11.012 --> 04:13.011
(Sean groans)

04:26.562 --> 04:28.561
(Marian gasps)

04:31.479 --> 04:33.798
(Phone buzzes)

04:35.796 --> 04:37.875
(Marian chokes)

04:42.072 --> 04:46.310
I never want to see you,
or speak to you, ever again.

04:47.509 --> 04:49.507
Do you understand?

04:50.907 --> 04:53.225
Your father
would have finished the job.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.219
(Breathes heavily)

05:06.576 --> 05:08.475
Let me speak to my brother.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.354
(Billy groaning)
Sean!

05:10.454 --> 05:12.193
Billy! I'm coming for you.

05:12.293 --> 05:15.011
(Billy) No. Sean... don't...
It's a trap.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.289
Just stay alive, Billy.

05:19.488 --> 05:21.567
(Elliot)
That's enough for now.

05:22.486 --> 05:24.625
What do you need me to do?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.723
(Elliot)
That's a good start, Sean.

05:27.683 --> 05:30.461
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what you need to do.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.560
So listen carefully.

05:55.585 --> 05:56.924
(Faz)
Sab!

05:57.024 --> 05:59.102
(Groans)

06:01.261 --> 06:03.260
(Grunts)

06:06.658 --> 06:08.936
What the fuck have you done?

06:09.696 --> 06:12.614
She helped
Elliot Carter try and kill me.

06:13.253 --> 06:15.232
I think she might know
where he is,

06:15.332 --> 06:17.231
who else is involved.

06:17.331 --> 06:18.870
I don't know this,

06:18.970 --> 06:21.128
but I'm not going to die wondering.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.366
Did you know about this?

06:25.725 --> 06:28.343
- Did you know about this?
- (Saba) I don't know anything.

06:28.443 --> 06:31.242
- Leave him alone.
- Ssshh.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.658
She is your people.

06:36.758 --> 06:39.077
She is your problem.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.634
Do this for me.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.329
I need answers from her.

06:51.429 --> 06:53.327
Saba, c'mon.

06:53.427 --> 06:54.966
I don't know.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.245
- Tell him!
- I don't know anything, I swear!

06:57.345 --> 06:59.343
Do this for me.

07:12.335 --> 07:14.334
Do it!

07:17.532 --> 07:19.530
A word.

07:22.688 --> 07:24.687
Wait.

07:28.165 --> 07:29.944
Elliot's got Billy.

07:30.044 --> 07:32.482
And he's cut
his fucking arm off.

07:33.481 --> 07:36.120
He'll let him live
if I surrender to him.

07:37.119 --> 07:40.277
Can you open a window?
I feel sick.

07:41.596 --> 07:43.095
(Sean) He's going
to give me an address.

07:43.195 --> 07:44.814
I said don't fuck with that.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.293
(Sean)
A GPS location.

07:46.393 --> 07:48.172
Look what
you fucking did to me, man!

07:48.272 --> 07:49.771
(Sean)
He wants me to go alone.

07:49.871 --> 07:51.870
Is Sean coming for me?

07:52.429 --> 07:54.808
You want morphine?
There's morphine.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.007
Fuck you.

07:56.107 --> 07:57.846
That's when we kill him.

07:57.946 --> 08:01.703
- (Faz) Let go of her, man!
- You're fucking nuts!

08:04.421 --> 08:06.420
I need your help.

08:10.378 --> 08:13.575
It's not a problem.
It's not a problem.

08:20.931 --> 08:22.929
(Gun clicks)

08:24.808 --> 08:28.006
Lucky. It will be quick for you.

08:33.443 --> 08:35.881
You can get rid of her.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.435
Don't fail me.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.825
(Koba)
We're going on a little trip.

09:02.144 --> 09:04.842
I need full comms. Sniper team.
Understood?

09:04.942 --> 09:06.601
- (Sniffs)
- Okay.

09:06.701 --> 09:09.040
Let's take
this motherfucker out!

09:09.140 --> 09:11.998
(Murmuring in Georgian)

09:12.098 --> 09:14.136
(Koba)
You did the right thing.

09:23.170 --> 09:25.169
(Hakim)
Faz, get the car.

09:26.209 --> 09:28.207
(Faz)
What do you mean?

09:28.927 --> 09:30.925
Hakim?

09:32.564 --> 09:35.023
- Hakim, you're not gonna...
- Get in the car!

09:35.123 --> 09:37.121
You don't need to see this.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.718
Move, Saba. Move.

09:46.435 --> 09:49.094
- (Saba whimpers)
- (Hakim) Get in the back room.

09:49.194 --> 09:52.372
Don't look at me like that.
You brought this on yourself.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.650
Move, come.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.849
Get in the back.
You're done, Saba.

09:56.949 --> 10:00.406
Hakim, what you doing, man?
Hakim, she can go.

10:00.506 --> 10:03.784
Just let her go.
Look, you don't have to do this...

10:04.384 --> 10:05.763
- Shut up.
- What you doing?

10:05.863 --> 10:07.642
- That's your cousin!
- Get in the fucking car.

10:07.742 --> 10:09.121
- That's your cousin!
- I don't care!

10:09.221 --> 10:10.400
She's a snake.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.879
Don't listen to Koba!

10:11.979 --> 10:13.838
I'm out here looking after
the whole fucking street, Faz.

10:13.938 --> 10:16.156
Koba's in charge now.
This is fucking happening.

10:16.256 --> 10:19.834
You're the snake, Hakim.
You betrayed Basem. Remember that?

10:19.934 --> 10:22.712
- You remember that shit?!
- Hakim, no!

10:22.812 --> 10:24.191
(Hakim)
What is wrong with you?

10:24.291 --> 10:27.589
I told you,
get in the fucking car, Faz!

10:27.689 --> 10:29.627
Don't fucking get in the way
or I'll shoot you next.

10:29.727 --> 10:33.565
- (Faz) Saba!
- (Screams)

10:39.601 --> 10:41.740
(Faz)
Saba! No!

10:41.840 --> 10:44.058
(Gunshots)

10:44.158 --> 10:46.157
(Screams)

11:00.068 --> 11:02.067
(Gun clatters to the floor)

11:07.943 --> 11:09.941
(Saba whimpering)

11:12.340 --> 11:14.878
(Burst of dramatic music)

11:14.978 --> 11:17.217
(Birdsong)

11:41.881 --> 11:43.880
(Distorted speech)

12:00.869 --> 12:03.587
(Muffled music playing)

12:13.860 --> 12:16.358
(Koba) Look, I don't want
to be the smart ass.

12:16.458 --> 12:19.636
But this is why
I don't allow my men families.

12:19.736 --> 12:21.735
You're missing out.
Trust me.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.954
(Koba)
I can help you kill Elliot,

12:24.054 --> 12:27.411
but we both know
there are other problems.

12:30.929 --> 12:33.767
Who do you think
stole our shipment?

12:34.607 --> 12:36.705
Luan?

12:36.805 --> 12:39.484
Maybe. But who told him?

12:40.323 --> 12:43.021
- Merwan?
- It was my mother.

12:43.121 --> 12:45.120
(Whistles)

12:47.798 --> 12:49.797
That's fucking heavy, man.

12:50.716 --> 12:53.674
What do you plan to do about that?

12:56.592 --> 12:58.631
It's power or family.

12:59.351 --> 13:02.189
- You can't have both.
- We get rid of her.

13:15.180 --> 13:18.358
(Luan)
I'm sorry. About your boy.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.797
(Marian)
The heroin's gone, Luan.

13:20.897 --> 13:24.075
(Luan) Was it Shannon?
Or do you think it's Ed?

13:24.175 --> 13:25.434
Are you protecting him?

13:25.534 --> 13:27.113
I'm saying it doesn't look like Ed.

13:27.213 --> 13:28.592
Well, you can't ask him,
can you?

13:28.692 --> 13:31.170
Because he won't
answer his fucking phone.

13:32.689 --> 13:33.868
(Sighs)

13:33.968 --> 13:36.287
We need that shipment.

13:36.886 --> 13:38.925
(Quiet suspenseful music)

13:41.404 --> 13:43.642
I can find the van.

13:45.161 --> 13:47.160
I put a tracker inside.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.697
I like insurance.

13:50.797 --> 13:55.434
Get it back.
Whatever it takes, get it back.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.378
(Muffled voices)

14:25.215 --> 14:29.273
- I'm doing this for us.
- No, no, no. This destroys us.

14:29.373 --> 14:32.031
Sean would have destroyed us.
Marian taking control

14:32.131 --> 14:35.129
would have destroyed us.
This gives us the power.

14:35.848 --> 14:37.627
We can build something
we never had before.

14:37.727 --> 14:41.105
- Marian helped you.
- No. She was helping herself.

14:41.205 --> 14:43.204
No.

14:43.843 --> 14:46.821
- I made promises. I can't do this.
- What are you doing?

14:46.921 --> 14:50.039
- I'll talk to Marian.
- You don't owe her anything.

14:51.598 --> 14:55.416
The Wallaces stood on our shoulders
and wanted our thanks for it.

14:55.516 --> 14:57.514
But not anymore.

14:59.753 --> 15:04.790
They used you, Dad.
For years, you were their bag carrier.

15:05.589 --> 15:07.588
Their little gravedigger.

15:10.386 --> 15:12.625
We do this now,
or we're nothing.

15:18.621 --> 15:20.839
- Did Elliot put you up to this?
- No.

15:20.939 --> 15:23.737
No. I can make my own decisions.

15:24.817 --> 15:28.474
(Sighs) So we're going
to sit here now and wait.

15:28.574 --> 15:29.753
Okay?

15:29.853 --> 15:33.551
- Shannon, this is not who you are.
- It's who I need to be.

15:33.651 --> 15:35.650
For Danny.

15:36.089 --> 15:38.968
And so I know my brother
didn't die for nothing.

15:44.564 --> 15:48.961
(Koba) You know, at some point,
I thought I would have to kill you.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.539
Not because I wanted to.

15:52.639 --> 15:54.837
Because a weak partner
is a liability.

15:57.316 --> 15:59.554
But what you did with Lale...

16:00.434 --> 16:02.612
And now your mother...

16:02.712 --> 16:05.151
Tells me
we might be on the same page.

16:11.586 --> 16:14.744
You know,
my dad used to test me.

16:15.864 --> 16:17.862
You and him would have got on.

16:20.141 --> 16:22.140
Test you how?

16:23.978 --> 16:28.196
When I was 14,
he buried a snitch up to his neck.

16:28.296 --> 16:32.333
(Sean) Put a bucket on his head.
Handed me a rifle.

16:38.089 --> 16:40.887
Motherfucker. What did you do?

16:42.886 --> 16:44.745
(Sean)
Pissed myself.

16:44.845 --> 16:46.844
(Quiet dramatic music)

16:49.922 --> 16:53.999
I wanted to run away.
Never come back.

16:57.037 --> 16:59.036
- Then I pulled the trigger.
- (Gunshot)

17:02.993 --> 17:04.992
Good boy.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.659
I'm sorry.

17:29.136 --> 17:31.255
I'm sorry about your dad.

17:35.372 --> 17:37.371
That was wrong.

17:38.530 --> 17:40.529
Man, that was wrong.

17:42.927 --> 17:44.966
We can talk about that.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.364
Elliot?

17:49.083 --> 17:51.362
We can talk about that.

17:56.918 --> 17:59.896
You told me
that people like him,

17:59.996 --> 18:01.995
the world just chews them up.

18:03.394 --> 18:05.912
That's the way it's built.
I'm sorry.

18:07.232 --> 18:09.230
It's not right.

18:11.229 --> 18:13.428
But killing Sean
is not going to change...

18:14.627 --> 18:16.626
fucking anything.

18:18.344 --> 18:20.503
It's not going to bring him back.

18:23.581 --> 18:25.580
It's just more blood.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.778
Do you think
he would have wanted that?

18:29.617 --> 18:31.616
No.

18:33.934 --> 18:36.093
I'm not doing this for my dad.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.449
I'm doing this for me.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.920
I'd like some morphine now.

19:17.786 --> 19:20.025
(Quiet dramatic music)

19:24.861 --> 19:27.080
(Sean) Elliot's gonna
send his location soon.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.179
Need to pull over.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.841
(Rock music playing
in the background)

20:08.593 --> 20:11.311
Can I have two burgers
with chips, please?

20:14.989 --> 20:17.068
I'll be right back.

20:20.346 --> 20:23.344
(Quiet suspenseful music)

20:46.489 --> 20:48.607
(Charlie)
What's going on, son?

20:53.924 --> 20:56.142
(Elliot)
I'm gonna get us out of here.

20:56.242 --> 20:58.361
Get you on that beach
in Jamaica.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.718
Better pack my shorts then.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.745
(Water trickles)

21:31.140 --> 21:33.138
(Phone vibrates)

21:51.327 --> 21:53.325
(Urine trickles)

22:00.241 --> 22:02.240
Look at this.

22:06.397 --> 22:11.773
Okay, it's an airfield,
about 20km.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.872
- Check it out.
- Okay.

22:19.189 --> 22:21.407
(Koba)
The story about your dad,

22:21.507 --> 22:23.966
it made me remember mine.

22:24.066 --> 22:26.064
(Chuckles)

22:27.623 --> 22:30.761
My sister had this dog, Margi.

22:30.861 --> 22:33.679
It got old,
she stopped being nice to it.

22:33.779 --> 22:36.917
It looked like a dirty old mop,
you know?

22:37.017 --> 22:39.216
Eyes like this...

22:40.935 --> 22:43.753
So I gave her a wash.
Shampoo.

22:43.853 --> 22:48.230
I comb her hair.
I put some ribbons here.

22:48.330 --> 22:52.007
A little crown
from one of my sister's dolls.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.546
I go downstairs.

22:54.646 --> 22:57.184
My father is with his friends.

22:57.284 --> 23:01.801
I show him,
"Dad, doesn't Margi look pretty?"

23:03.080 --> 23:05.179
I'm 6.

23:05.279 --> 23:07.517
His friends are looking at me.

23:10.635 --> 23:15.392
My dad beats
the shit out of me right there.

23:16.751 --> 23:18.750
(Laughs)

23:20.509 --> 23:22.668
The fucking dog...

23:24.347 --> 23:26.785
running around with a crown.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.582
(Laughs)

23:34.420 --> 23:36.479
Ah!

23:36.579 --> 23:38.437
Dads, man.

23:38.537 --> 23:40.236
Ah...

23:40.336 --> 23:43.174
Ah, they wipe their boots on you,
don't they?

23:44.054 --> 23:45.433
Tell me about it.

23:45.533 --> 23:47.591
(Koba)
They can't help it.

23:47.691 --> 23:49.690
Who gives a fuck?

23:57.085 --> 23:58.904
(Tamaz)
We tracked the location.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.822
We got the sniper team
en route? Okay.

24:01.922 --> 24:03.981
Giorgi is taking a fucking shit.

24:04.081 --> 24:05.940
Head to this airfield.
We'll follow.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.818
(Tamaz whistles)

24:07.918 --> 24:09.917
(Koba)
Let's get this done.

24:19.231 --> 24:21.230
(Engine revs)

24:27.826 --> 24:30.824
(Koba)
Not bad. Maybe less onions.

24:33.502 --> 24:35.621
Where the fuck is Giorgi?

24:40.258 --> 24:43.615
What, not hungry?
You wanted it a minute ago.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.052
Man's gotta eat. Hm?

24:56.007 --> 24:58.006
Mm...

25:09.359 --> 25:11.058
What the fuck?

25:11.158 --> 25:13.156
Look at that.

25:15.795 --> 25:17.793
Hand me that napkin.

25:21.191 --> 25:23.190
(Groans)

25:25.588 --> 25:27.587
Whoa!

25:28.466 --> 25:30.325
(Muffled speech)

25:30.425 --> 25:32.424
Can't feel it.

25:32.943 --> 25:37.900
Think I'm having...
a fucking stroke?

25:39.939 --> 25:41.938
(Groans)

25:44.176 --> 25:46.315
What the fuck?

25:46.415 --> 25:48.553
Call the...

25:48.653 --> 25:50.232
Call the...

25:50.332 --> 25:52.331
(Groans)

25:53.330 --> 25:57.428
(Muffled)
I'm sorry. It'll be over soon.

25:57.528 --> 25:59.526
No fucking way.

26:01.325 --> 26:04.383
(Muffled) It's a compound poison.
You're paralysed.

26:04.483 --> 26:07.001
(Eerie music)

26:10.479 --> 26:12.478
(Moans)

26:36.382 --> 26:38.861
(Whimpers)

26:45.616 --> 26:47.615
Look at me.

26:50.253 --> 26:52.252
(Shouting) Look at me!

26:55.130 --> 26:57.169
You're a fucking fool.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.507
I know.

27:00.607 --> 27:03.245
Why, man? Why?

27:09.921 --> 27:11.919
(Moans)

27:18.755 --> 27:21.353
(Muffled)
You wouldn't understand.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.744
(Rasping breath)

27:40.301 --> 27:42.540
(Dramatic music)

28:06.244 --> 28:08.243
(Sighs)

28:55.293 --> 28:57.291
(Tyres screech)

29:06.685 --> 29:08.684
(Sean)
It's done.

29:09.763 --> 29:11.142
What kept you?

29:11.242 --> 29:13.561
(Shouting)
I said it's fucking done!

29:16.759 --> 29:18.757
Now what?

29:21.716 --> 29:25.133
You'd better get a move on.
Your brother's bleeding out here.

29:25.233 --> 29:27.052
(Sean)
You'd better keep him alive,

29:27.152 --> 29:29.151
or I'll fucking kill you.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.165
- So tell me, how d'you do it?
- (Sean) Why does it matter?

29:38.265 --> 29:40.264
I'm just curious.

29:42.262 --> 29:46.060
Fuck that! I want to talk to Billy.
Put Billy on.

29:49.737 --> 29:51.736
You'll see him soon.

29:56.333 --> 30:00.071
- (Whispers) Fuck!
- (Elliot) But only if you cooperate.

30:00.171 --> 30:02.169
Okay, what do you want me to do?

30:04.768 --> 30:08.385
Shit! Come on,
come on, come on...

30:08.485 --> 30:10.144
Fuck.

30:10.244 --> 30:12.243
That's better.

30:17.479 --> 30:19.898
(Breathes rapidly)

30:19.998 --> 30:23.036
(Elliot) I'm sending you
the real location now.

30:25.594 --> 30:28.252
- (Phone pings)
- It's an old power station.

30:28.352 --> 30:32.030
Dumping ground.
People won't come looking there.

30:34.548 --> 30:36.127
Come alone.

30:36.227 --> 30:38.086
Come unarmed.

30:38.186 --> 30:40.385
Or you'll never see Billy again.

30:42.144 --> 30:46.381
It's your life or his. We're good?

30:50.258 --> 30:52.257
Fuck! Fuck!

31:05.688 --> 31:08.806
(Laboured breathing)

31:15.202 --> 31:17.321
Ah, Billy. Fuck!

31:27.314 --> 31:29.313
Billy! Stay awake, Bill.

31:31.791 --> 31:34.230
Don't go falling asleep now.

31:35.869 --> 31:37.927
Billy, are you there?

31:38.027 --> 31:40.546
Hey, say something.

31:41.705 --> 31:42.964
Billy!

31:43.064 --> 31:44.803
Billy!

31:44.903 --> 31:46.902
Come on, stay with me.

31:48.181 --> 31:49.280
Almost.

31:49.380 --> 31:51.619
Don't fucking do that!

31:55.816 --> 31:57.815
(Billy groans)

32:13.205 --> 32:15.203
(Engine revs)

32:26.636 --> 32:30.154
(Video game
on in the background)

33:13.965 --> 33:15.704
- (Ed) They're here.
- (Danny) Who's here?

33:15.804 --> 33:18.422
- Albanians.
- Danny, stay. How many?

33:18.522 --> 33:20.221
- Two cars.
- How did they find us?

33:20.321 --> 33:22.920
- (Ed) Marian...
- I'm not running.

33:25.198 --> 33:27.197
Look at me.

33:30.275 --> 33:33.033
If we do this,
there's no turning back.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.548
Danny. Come with me.

33:45.665 --> 33:47.664
Now!

33:55.139 --> 33:57.137
(Metallic clang)

33:59.776 --> 34:01.774
In there.

34:09.569 --> 34:12.088
(Door bursts open)

34:21.682 --> 34:23.720
(Gangster whistles)

34:24.440 --> 34:26.478
(Indistinct chatter)

34:39.710 --> 34:41.709
(Rapid gunfire)

35:29.638 --> 35:32.096
(Glass shards tinkle)

35:32.196 --> 35:34.435
(Melancholic music)

36:00.058 --> 36:02.656
(Music builds)

36:27.360 --> 36:29.359
(Dialling tone)

36:35.035 --> 36:37.154
Luan, listen to me.

36:38.313 --> 36:40.052
We don't have to do it like this.

36:40.152 --> 36:42.450
(Luan)
Then return what you stole.

36:42.550 --> 36:45.528
(Ed) You really want Marian
to have all that power?

36:45.628 --> 36:49.286
She won't go away.
She's lost too much.

36:49.386 --> 36:51.385
(Ed)
I will work it out with Marian.

36:52.704 --> 36:54.703
Luan...

36:56.062 --> 37:00.219
you got your wife back.
Remember that.

37:03.457 --> 37:06.395
There's a reckoning
elsewhere tonight.

37:06.495 --> 37:08.494
Let's wait.

37:09.213 --> 37:11.492
See what tomorrow brings.

37:17.488 --> 37:19.487
(Engine revs)

37:38.914 --> 37:42.472
It's all right. It's all right.

38:01.659 --> 38:04.338
(Suspenseful music)

38:45.711 --> 38:48.589
(Sat-nav) You've arrived
at your destination.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.878
(Elliot)
Knees, Billy.

41:44.076 --> 41:46.074
(Billy grunts)

41:51.591 --> 41:53.589
Jacket.

41:56.228 --> 41:58.226
Slowly.

42:19.253 --> 42:21.251
Turn.

42:31.405 --> 42:33.404
Lose it.

42:33.723 --> 42:35.722
Sean, don't.

42:38.360 --> 42:41.518
Don't. No. No.

42:44.237 --> 42:45.855
(Billy)
Don't...

42:45.955 --> 42:47.954
(Gun clatters)

42:48.914 --> 42:50.912
Now let him go.

42:58.987 --> 43:00.986
Knees.

43:16.935 --> 43:19.094
I love you, Billy.

43:20.253 --> 43:22.552
No. Sean... Don't.

43:22.652 --> 43:24.650
(Groans)

43:37.562 --> 43:39.841
(Billy)
Elliot, don't!

43:41.480 --> 43:43.478
Elliot!

43:44.837 --> 43:46.916
(Elliot)
Was it all worth it?

43:52.712 --> 43:54.711
- (Grunts)
- (Groans)

43:57.989 --> 43:59.248
(Grunts)

43:59.348 --> 44:01.347
(Elliot groans)

44:04.145 --> 44:06.144
(Roars)

44:30.168 --> 44:32.167
(Breathes heavily)

45:09.303 --> 45:11.302
(Elliot yells)

45:16.018 --> 45:18.017
(Sean roars)

45:22.814 --> 45:24.813
(Chokes)

45:56.033 --> 45:57.252
(Sean roars)

45:57.352 --> 45:59.390
(Rapid gunfire)

46:12.702 --> 46:14.701
(Panting)

46:37.246 --> 46:39.245
(Rapid gunfire)

47:03.829 --> 47:05.827
(Drum clatters)

47:54.996 --> 47:57.394
(Muffled groaning)

48:14.943 --> 48:17.581
(Elliot grunts)

48:35.090 --> 48:37.088
(Sean chokes)

48:39.647 --> 48:42.125
(Melancholic dramatic music)

48:49.640 --> 48:51.639
(Choking intensifies)

49:09.348 --> 49:11.346
Your...

49:12.426 --> 49:14.424
dad...

49:15.584 --> 49:17.582
would be...

49:18.702 --> 49:20.700
proud.

49:32.373 --> 49:34.371
(Gasping)

50:18.303 --> 50:20.302
(Billy)
Please!

50:29.856 --> 50:31.854
Please!

50:32.414 --> 50:34.393
Please!

50:34.493 --> 50:35.712
Please!

50:35.812 --> 50:37.810
Let him down!

50:40.169 --> 50:42.168
Let him down!

50:43.407 --> 50:44.706
Elliot!

50:44.806 --> 50:46.805
(Strangulated gasps)

50:47.764 --> 50:49.763
(Music fades)

51:12.868 --> 51:15.026
(Siren wails)

51:39.530 --> 51:41.529
(Siren wails)

51:53.042 --> 51:55.480
(Quiet dramatic music)

52:07.912 --> 52:10.630
(Indistinct speech)

52:32.216 --> 52:34.215
It's not enough.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.652
Killing you...

52:39.492 --> 52:40.831
it's not enough.

52:40.931 --> 52:44.289
(Ed) Tamaz, why don't you tell us
what really happened to Koba?

52:45.368 --> 52:49.185
We are trying to get reports over.
Don't you worry about that.

52:49.285 --> 52:51.324
(Indistinct speech)

52:53.363 --> 52:55.361
(Groaning)

53:00.518 --> 53:03.676
I'm gonna make you watch,
Sean Wallace.

53:06.154 --> 53:09.312
I'm gonna take everything
you ever built.

53:11.471 --> 53:13.470
Your power.

53:14.069 --> 53:16.068
Your people.

53:18.826 --> 53:20.485
Your city.

53:20.585 --> 53:22.904
(Sean gasps)

53:24.742 --> 53:26.941
(Elliot)
And I'm gonna replace you.

53:29.020 --> 53:31.018
(Siren wails)

53:32.098 --> 53:35.416
(Muffled speech)

53:46.129 --> 53:48.027
(Asif)
When the world shifts,

53:48.127 --> 53:49.746
so must you.

53:49.846 --> 53:51.845
Or it leaves you behind.

53:52.604 --> 53:54.603
London is in my dreams.

53:55.563 --> 53:57.921
My shining city on the hill.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.759
Yet I find myself in exile.

54:03.717 --> 54:05.716
I need a partner...

54:06.595 --> 54:08.714
with experience
of that wretched

54:09.633 --> 54:11.632
goldmine of a city.

54:12.951 --> 54:15.230
I need a fellow exile...

54:16.669 --> 54:19.247
with as much desire as I have,

54:19.347 --> 54:22.185
to reclaim what was stolen.

54:24.304 --> 54:26.542
(Melancholic music)

54:31.739 --> 54:34.178
Things change...

54:39.174 --> 54:41.373
don't they, Lale?

54:57.043 --> 54:59.161
They do.

55:07.796 --> 55:09.795
(Lighter clicks)
