WEBVTT

00:25.484 --> 00:26.902
-Nikki.
-Yeah.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.779
Tell me again what it is we're doing here.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.782
Well, it's a chance
for new families to bond, isn't it?

00:32.448 --> 00:35.452
And I still haven't bonded
properly with Princess.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.788
-I've not had the moment yet.
-What moment?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.540
The moment.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.501
The "look into each other's eyes,"
"you're the one" moment.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.419
I feel like you guys have all had that.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.879
I haven't had it yet.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.385
Jase, do you get the vibe
she doesn't like me?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.304
No. Why? Do you?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.431
Maybe.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.560
I don't know how to tell.
No one's ever not liked me before.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.353
Okay. Well, now I don't like you.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.397
Look, you get them all week.
This is my chance.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.359
I just thought they'd fall for me
the way you did, you know?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.528
-Immediately.
-Okay.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.613
Look, just don't put too much on it.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.532
Don't force it.
Just let it flow, you know?

01:13.615 --> 01:14.950
-Yeah.
-What do I know?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.286
Hello!

01:17.786 --> 01:18.829
I made a new friend.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
You've been here two minutes.
I haven't even signed in yet.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.457
I know. It's sort of a superpower.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.293
-Hello. Jason.
-Hi, Rosa, this is Jason.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.128
-Hi, Jason.
-Hello, Rosa. How are you?

01:26.211 --> 01:27.212
-Jason.
-Yes.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.047
My friend runs an expat group in Spain.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.341
-I'll get the number for your dad.
-Amazing. Thank you so much.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.426
Four minutes.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.470
I mean, I literally lived with Freddy
for two years

01:35.554 --> 01:37.389
before I even knew he had a sister.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.433
Okay, kids! Come and get your badges!

01:39.933 --> 01:42.311
Good boy, Tyler.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.812
And you're Nikki-- Jason--

01:43.896 --> 01:46.023
-No, I'm Princess!
-Yes, I know.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.524
All right, go and finish your story.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.110
What's with the lamp?

01:50.194 --> 01:52.070
The lamp. Well, that's Adam.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.489
See, it used to be a rock.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.950
And then we thought
anything would be better than that.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.702
It's been a lateral move, Rosa.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.788
Kids, badges!

02:01.872 --> 02:02.873
Bye.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.961
She's so great.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.964
Hey. Don't be competitive.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.051
She's got a much nicer personality
than she needs to with a face like that.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.720
No, she was either bullied at school
or her dad left, guaranteed.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.723
Some people are just
pretty and nice, okay?

02:21.725 --> 02:24.061
-Let's bond the shit out of this.
-Yes!

02:26.313 --> 02:27.564
Tickly, tickly.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.274
Tickly little kids.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.776
Tickly little kids.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.070
Tiny, little tickly people.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.446
People…

02:51.421 --> 02:53.340
It's so pretty here.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.427
Maybe we shouldn't buy the flat.
Maybe we should just move here.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.179
Away from all the crime and the drugs.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.057
Are you kidding?
Way more drugs in the country.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.184
-What?
-Well, nothing else to do, is there?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.895
Literally everyone here is high
on crack or red diesel.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.399
Here you go.
All right, guys, what do you reckon?

03:10.482 --> 03:11.984
-Look at this. Perfect spot.
-Yeah!

03:12.067 --> 03:15.112
-Let's do this! Perfect.
-Tyler, some water?

03:23.161 --> 03:24.204
Right!

03:24.288 --> 03:26.206
Hands up, who wants to put up a tent?

03:28.750 --> 03:29.626
Princess, catch!

03:29.710 --> 03:32.796
-Princess is in. There you go. Lovely.
-No, I was trying to catch the peg!

03:32.880 --> 03:34.506
Hold on a second, where's the peg?

03:34.590 --> 03:36.216
Where's the peg? Where is the peg?

03:36.300 --> 03:39.303
There's the peg. Found the peg.
But where's Princess gone? Princess?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.387
-I'm here!
-Princess?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.306
Oh, my God, there's a tiny bear!

03:42.389 --> 03:44.349
-There is a tiny little bear.
-Okay, no, look-- Guys--

03:44.433 --> 03:46.059
That's funny,
but we need to put the tent up.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.770
Otherwise we're just four people
standing up in a field, aren't we?

03:48.854 --> 03:49.980
So, come on.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.648
-People still do that, yeah?
-What?

03:51.732 --> 03:54.359
-Roll sleeves up before they do something.
-Some people, yes!

03:54.443 --> 03:57.738
Here is a magnificent, tiny bear!

03:57.821 --> 04:00.240
Now Tyler's gone. Tyler?

04:00.324 --> 04:01.867
Yes. Yeah. All right.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.535
-What?
-Listen, can I have a word?

04:03.619 --> 04:04.828
Yeah, all right.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.789
Right. Find that peg. What?
What's the matter?

04:07.873 --> 04:09.666
It's not fair
you're always having fun with them.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.210
I don't know how to be like that.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.086
Teach me to be like you.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.880
What? What do you mean?

04:14.963 --> 04:18.091
I'm not fun enough.
That's why she prefers you.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.052
Come on. You're loads of fun.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.137
What about you at Emily's birthday drinks?

04:22.221 --> 04:25.182
Then that time we had wine
with Dave in the park. Remember that?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.309
And what about that brewery tour, you r--

04:28.435 --> 04:29.895
-Okay. All right.
-No.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.105
I join in the fun. I don't bring the fun.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.609
I always overthink things with the kids.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.403
You never do anything by the book,
and it always works out.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.489
I do everything by the book,
and it never works out.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.449
Oh, my God!
Did I buy the wrong bloody book?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.618
-Just be yourself, Nikki.
-No!

04:44.701 --> 04:46.954
No one should be themselves
until they know it's safe.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.039
Be someone else until they like you,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.834
then become yourself gradually
so you don't scare them off.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.669
Right.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.588
No, I need to be more Jason.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.049
-Where do I start?
-I don't know, have a laugh.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.175
Get-- But how?

05:00.259 --> 05:03.679
Go in there. Have a bit of banter
with them or something, you know?

05:03.762 --> 05:04.763
-Right.
-Yeah?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.515
-Right.
-Okay.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.894
Tell you what, you put up the tent.
I'm just gonna do a few notes.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.230
-All right.
-Just think of a few ad-libs.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.567
Come on, then, you two.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.743
Free kick! Reds!

05:29.746 --> 05:31.707
Are we gonna get out at all?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.334
No! It's pissing it down.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.882
I'll be honest with you.
I think I've lost my passion for teaching.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.886
Throw-in. Blue!

05:45.053 --> 05:47.639
Yeah. I can sense it ebbing a bit.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.934
I thought coaching might spark something.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.561
It hasn't.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.063
I think I'm jealous of them.

05:55.772 --> 05:56.815
Their potential.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.319
Sometimes I give the pretty ones
worse marks

06:00.402 --> 06:03.614
'cause I just think,
"You've got enough." You know?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.240
That's bad, isn't it?

06:05.741 --> 06:08.202
Nah, it isn't. It's true.
We do have enough.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.621
Here.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.080
Finish it if you want.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.001
They're not mine.
They were in lost property.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.378
Amy,

06:18.921 --> 06:20.589
how long for? This is fish.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.091
Too fancy for lost lunches?

06:23.592 --> 06:24.676
Nice to be you.

06:25.761 --> 06:26.762
No.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.643
Everyone else in my life has a passion.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.853
What's mine?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.563
Don't know, mate.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.399
One thing's for sure. It is not kids.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.110
Come o--

06:44.571 --> 06:46.865
Jessica, move your arse!

06:48.283 --> 06:49.993
No, it is not.

06:51.787 --> 06:55.249
Should put that out a bit further,
I reckon. What about you? Tyler?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.502
-Okay. Give her the hammer.
-All right, guys.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.755
How we all doing? Oh, yeah.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.925
Where is Princess? Where is she?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.260
I can't find--

07:06.969 --> 07:09.763
I can't find her anywhere.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.682
Where are the pegs then?

07:11.765 --> 07:12.766
Come on, kids.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.310
And the tent's not fully up, but--

07:15.394 --> 07:17.729
That's fine 'cause we're all having fun!

07:17.813 --> 07:19.857
Sorry, can I have a little word with you?

07:20.732 --> 07:23.485
So then what is that?
Is that what you think I'm like?

07:23.569 --> 07:25.195
Yeah, in spirit. Yeah, I do.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.321
Come on, guys!

07:26.405 --> 07:27.656
Hey, all right, give me that.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.283
-Jase, I'm being banter-y.
-Give me that.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.159
-This isn't gonna work, all right?
-Why?

07:31.243 --> 07:32.870
'Cause you're not being me, are you?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.039
To do that, you need to understand
where the banter comes from, all right?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.958
And to do that,
you need to fully understand

07:38.041 --> 07:39.042
my…

07:40.711 --> 07:42.004
philosophy of life.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.257
-Your philosophy of life?
-Yeah.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.302
-Yeah, what?
-No, nothing, it's--

07:48.385 --> 07:49.887
You rarely hear a phrase like that

07:49.970 --> 07:53.098
coming from someone eating two
children's yogurts, but please go ahead.

07:53.182 --> 07:56.018
You know, I suppose it's just--
You need to--

07:57.311 --> 08:00.022
You need to maximize the positives,
not minimize the negatives.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.316
So you should ask yourself
not what could go wrong,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.318
more what could go right.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.154
But seriously, Jase, you really just--
You never worry about anything.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.322
Worrying. Pointless, innit?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.991
There might've been use for it
when there were saber-toothed tigers,

08:11.074 --> 08:13.285
but all it does now is hold you back.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.412
So, for instance,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.664
first thing in the bag should be
the water pistol

08:19.291 --> 08:21.793
and not the first aid box.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.629
So, you gotta

08:24.838 --> 08:26.048
live in the moment.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.382
Get bloody stuck in.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.301
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

08:29.384 --> 08:30.761
No, I can do that.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.182
Listen, can I take Princess
this afternoon, just me and her?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.475
Yeah. Lovely. All right.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.477
-That is tight, son!
-Where do you think I'm from?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.354
I don't know.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.524
Hello.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.027
Princess, do you know what kayaking is?

08:47.653 --> 08:50.822
Well, you get in a boat,
and you paddle around in it.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.824
Is Jason coming?

08:52.908 --> 08:53.992
No.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.454
No, I thought
it might be nice if it was just us.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.915
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.378
Oh, no, I don't think kids can take
anything on the kayak, actually.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.924
But because I'm fun and cool,

09:09.758 --> 09:13.971
and if you promise not to tell anyone,
I'm gonna let you take one thing.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.139
Not Jason.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.077
Oh, no.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.130
Are you joining us?

09:53.635 --> 09:55.679
So, we have a new member today.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.183
Freddy? Would you like to tell us
why you're here?

10:03.187 --> 10:04.688
It's okay just to listen.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.772
No. Okay?

10:06.732 --> 10:09.776
Hi, my name's Freddy,
and I am not an alcoholic.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.653
We understand it can be difficult--

10:11.737 --> 10:14.031
Really, I'm not. I'm just an arsehole.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.742
I didn't lose everything
'cause of the old…

10:16.825 --> 10:21.038
I lost it 'cause I'm an arsehole, and--
Well, is it really that different?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.706
'Cause the only real difference is

10:22.789 --> 10:26.210
that I don't have a place to go and talk
where I won't be judged.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.337
And I need to tell some people.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.466
Because I am not a strong person.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.718
People just assume that because I'm tall.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.848
I had an affair, and I lost my family.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.523
Feels so good to be able to be honest.

10:47.606 --> 10:48.815
This is a safe space.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.276
You're a good person
who deserves to be happy.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.820
Doing one bad thing doesn't change that.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.616
I mean, I do have a few more.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.961
You all right?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.547
How far do we have to go?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.758
Far enough
so that we can't see the tent anymore.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.510
What do you think? Yeah?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.679
What's your favorite thing
about being here?

11:18.762 --> 11:21.223
-The sound the zip makes on the tent.
-Oh, yeah?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.684
Is Adam cold?

11:23.767 --> 11:26.186
No, he's not cold, mate.
He's made of metal, look!

11:27.688 --> 11:28.689
Are there badgers?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.899
-Do you like badgers, yeah?
-No.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.317
Then there's no badgers.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.443
There might be.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.654
I have never once seen a badger
in my entire life.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.573
In fact, I once went
to a wildlife sanctuary.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.825
I stood outside the badger enclosure.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.119
I banged on the glass.
Even threw a little bit of food in.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.537
Still no badgers.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.788
There are no badgers.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.499
-All right, gents.
-Afternoon.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.254
It's all right, mate. It's all right.
It's a squirrel or something.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.841
Can squirrels grab things?

11:55.924 --> 11:57.593
Yeah, I suppose so, sometimes, yeah.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.346
Okay, then you take him.
Just so he's safe.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.472
Okay.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.976
Can squirrels eat people?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
No, only nuts. You're not a nut, are you?

12:08.979 --> 12:11.356
No. Miss Keele says I'm just different.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.993
Sometimes I worry about my morals.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.870
When there's a plane crash or something,

12:24.953 --> 12:28.874
the only way I can feel sympathy is
if I imagine all the people were puppies.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.042
That's not right, is it?

12:31.293 --> 12:32.961
If there's a charity appeal on the TV,

12:33.045 --> 12:35.339
I get my phone out
so people will think I'm donating.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.132
I'm just reading The Spectator online.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.426
Every time.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.762
Okay, well, should we take a little--

12:41.845 --> 12:43.639
I didn't cry at all when my gran died.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.475
I feel so guilty.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.772
I was the one who suggested
we take her skiing.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.441
You okay?

12:54.525 --> 12:56.318
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.946
Oh, no. Shark!

13:05.410 --> 13:08.789
I'm only kidding.
Yeah, there's no sharks here.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
No, the crocodiles chased them all away.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.087
I didn't bring my camera.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.048
Okay, mental picture.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.390
You thirsty?

13:26.473 --> 13:27.850
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I thought so.

13:27.933 --> 13:31.562
I'm just gonna get your water
out of my bag!

13:34.189 --> 13:36.733
What's the matter? You get wet, Princess?

13:36.817 --> 13:39.152
When I heard about that earthquake
in Puerto Rico,

13:39.236 --> 13:40.696
I was eating my breakfast.

13:40.779 --> 13:44.074
I didn't even lose my appetite,
just carried on eating.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.492
Had another egg.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.952
And I'm pretty sexist.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.289
I can't find any woman attractive
if she has very short hair.

13:50.372 --> 13:54.334
When I see women with really short hair,
I'm not undressing them with my eyes.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.462
I'm adding hair.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.339
Okay, really time for a break now.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.841
Anyone else know there's a website

14:00.924 --> 14:03.594
that compiles all the naked scenes
from Game of Thrones?

14:03.677 --> 14:04.678
'Cause I do.

14:11.977 --> 14:16.148
We've had such a lovely afternoon.
How was your day?

14:16.231 --> 14:17.524
We've got a problem.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.985
You left a vacuum, and I couldn't fill it.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.112
Shut up. They love you.

14:22.196 --> 14:24.198
Because when you're around,
I get to be the fun one.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.242
But when you leave,
then he starts coming at me

14:27.326 --> 14:31.622
with, like, feelings and lamps
and feelings about lamps, and I don't--

14:31.705 --> 14:33.832
Honestly, I didn't know what to say.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.795
Well… he's never had a family, has he?

14:38.879 --> 14:41.423
So he's always creating families
all around him.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.470
Okay, so to Tyler,
that flower isn't just a flower.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.056
Right, that is a baby flower

14:49.139 --> 14:52.809
with a mummy and sister flower
who love him very much.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.188
The lamp is part of his family.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.566
Yeah, exactly.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.443
-Careful.
-I know.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.865
He can't come to you yet,
so you need to go to him.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.160
You need to feel the world
the way that he feels it.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.996
-Yeah? Then you'll understand him.
-Okay.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.706
Yeah, okay.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.500
I'll try.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.168
-I'll give it a go.
-Okay.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.966
Hey, how'd you do that water bottle thing?

15:24.049 --> 15:25.050
What water bottle thing?

15:25.133 --> 15:27.052
The thing when you know
exactly when they're thirsty.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.178
-No, I don't.
-You do.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.638
No, I don't.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.640
-No, I'm all right, thanks.
-See, I haven't got a clue.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.614
Gather round.

15:47.698 --> 15:52.119
Okay, my lovely little pumpkin seeds.
Capture the flag.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.204
We have ten family teams,

15:54.288 --> 15:57.332
and you must all take a flag
and plant it somewhere.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.584
Come and get your flags.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.295
Oh, no, sorry. We're red.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.046
We're red. I got the red flag.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.633
You must try to capture
the other teams' flags.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.886
But if you are caught
in another team's territory,

16:08.969 --> 16:11.638
then you are sent to jail.

16:11.722 --> 16:14.516
But don't worry,
there are nachos and dips.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.770
So fly, my lovelies, and plant your flags
where no one shall find them!

16:20.647 --> 16:22.608
Except me, actually,
'cause I need them back by end of day.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.445
-Did you get those rules?
-Let's go!

16:27.321 --> 16:28.405
I want to beat her.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.575
Yeah, I wanna beat her, but I won't.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.911
I won't. No one's keeping score.
Just a bit of fun, isn't it?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.872
-Doesn't matter that they won the tents.
-Okay, come on.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.923
Well, that's another 400 views
for The Undercover Banker.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.509
I sent you the link.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.138
What's this?

16:53.222 --> 16:55.724
This is my insider's blog
on the banking industry.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.267
I found a route around the--

16:57.809 --> 17:01.230
the straight, white, cis male gatekeepers
of the publishing industry.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.566
It's a real state-of-the-nation
call to arms,

17:04.650 --> 17:06.609
inspired by the work of Sólveig Anspach,

17:06.693 --> 17:10.531
who, in my opinion,
really should be every bit as famous

17:10.614 --> 17:11.949
as Hans-Jürgen Syberberg.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.535
Well, don't worry. She is.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.330
So great to have a calling.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.086
What?

17:24.169 --> 17:26.880
I hate my job, Scott.

17:26.964 --> 17:30.133
I hate it so much and all of the time.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.303
I've had no idea.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.097
What do you-- What--

17:35.764 --> 17:37.224
Which part of it do you hate?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.017
The children.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.102
Right.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.646
That's quite a big part.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.732
I just can't stand them anymore.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.652
Their tiny little faces

17:48.735 --> 17:52.489
and their tiny little brains
and their tiny little hands.

17:52.573 --> 17:56.785
And how it takes them 45 minutes
to eat two slices of apple.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.580
And how the whole day is about them.

17:59.663 --> 18:03.083
I mean, seriously,
is nobody gonna ask me how I am?

18:04.793 --> 18:07.963
You know, I have given them
the best years of my life,

18:08.046 --> 18:09.673
and they won't even remember my name.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.342
And they just walk off with my stuff.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.013
Do you know how many of my glue spreaders
came back intact at the end of last term?

18:17.681 --> 18:19.558
You'd be shocked, Scott.

18:19.641 --> 18:23.437
You know,
all I do is think about their future.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.480
Well, who is gonna think about mine?

18:25.564 --> 18:27.107
Whose job is it to think about that?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.861
Yes, another like.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.864
Sorry.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.328
What's a glue spreader?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.378
Princess, want a drop of water?

18:51.048 --> 18:52.174
They're so fluffy.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.468
Wait, wait, wait.

18:54.551 --> 18:58.096
-There's someone in our territory.
-Quick, hide!

19:08.982 --> 19:12.236
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, honey.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.446
Look at that.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.490
-I love you, Mummy.
-I love you.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.242
I want to beat them.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.119
I don't want to be relaxed.
I don't just want to be fun.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.330
I want to take things too seriously.
I want to be me again.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.706
I want you to be you again.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.208
Thanks. Gasping.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.386
Let's win this.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.847
Nikki, that is incredibly hot.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.599
-Three, two, one. Go!
-Come on!

19:58.532 --> 20:00.951
I'm so sorry.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.621
It's all right. Not scary.

20:15.883 --> 20:16.884
Now!

20:19.428 --> 20:22.472
Run!

20:22.556 --> 20:24.683
We're gonna win!

20:25.267 --> 20:26.393
-Stop!
-What?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.353
Where's Adam?

20:29.188 --> 20:30.439
What are we gonna do?

20:32.107 --> 20:34.443
We go back. No one left behind.

20:35.611 --> 20:37.696
He's part of the family. Come on.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.410
I don't get it. Why isn't he here?

20:44.453 --> 20:47.372
Adam.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.334
Quick, come on.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.630
-Come on.
-Hey, stop!

20:54.713 --> 20:56.840
-Hey, stop!
-Stop!

21:05.724 --> 21:07.100
-Good.
-Come on.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.193
Adam!

21:16.276 --> 21:18.403
Yeah, he's a bit beaten up.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.905
There they are.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.372
Go sit down there.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.628
Oh, God.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.710
-This is sexy?
-No.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.086
-No?
-No.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.421
Come on.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.175
-Is that my bronzer? Jase.
-I don't know.

23:03.258 --> 23:07.304
-I don't know. It was just in your bag.
-That's expensive. Bloody hell.

23:12.184 --> 23:13.560
We can't move here.

23:14.853 --> 23:15.938
These are city kids.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.524
When we went for a walk
in the pine forest, Princess asked,

23:18.607 --> 23:20.150
"Why did the air smell like shower gel?"

23:24.821 --> 23:27.908
Do you know what?
It's a gift you have, not to worry.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.160
-I don't know.
-Really, no, it's great.

23:32.704 --> 23:33.872
Has your dad put the money through?

23:35.916 --> 23:38.377
No. But he's-- What did he--

23:38.460 --> 23:40.462
He said it's gonna be soon.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.673
And that he'll--

23:43.549 --> 23:44.591
So, yeah.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.094
Yeah.

23:48.971 --> 23:51.515
It worked for a bit, didn't it?
Me being you.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.892
Only 'cause I was being you
'cause someone's got to be.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.229
Look, any idiot can be "fun."

23:58.146 --> 23:59.773
But when shit gets real,

23:59.857 --> 24:03.986
then they're gonna look to you for things
that I'm just not able to give them.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.824
Princess? Do you want seconds?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.829
She's doing it on purpose, Nikki.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.205
Hey, she's stress testing you

24:15.289 --> 24:17.499
because she wants to know
if you're gonna give up.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.084
And if you are,

24:19.168 --> 24:21.670
then she needs to know
sooner rather than later.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.464
Yes.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.967
-Guess who's been reading some books?
-Shut up.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.635
No, I had a chat with Rosa about it.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.638
She said that she was the same
with her stepdad.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.932
Dad abandoned her. See? Told you.

24:35.851 --> 24:36.852
All right, mate.

24:40.856 --> 24:44.067
The point is,
she's making it hard for you on purpose.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.652
Well, she's picked on the wrong person

24:45.736 --> 24:48.447
if she thinks I'm gonna give up
when things get hard.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.073
Because little does she know…

24:51.116 --> 24:53.118
I find everything hard.

24:54.328 --> 24:55.954
You'll win her over eventually.

24:57.247 --> 24:59.124
And if she's anything like me,

25:00.709 --> 25:02.836
then she won't even know it's happening.
