<i>Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:04.077 --> 00:06.860
<i>You have the opportunity
to take part in a drug trial.</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:09.947
Everything is okay
if you just do what he says.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.156
- Do what who says?

00:12.451 --> 00:15.035
- Who's the kid?
- This is Amy Bellafonte.

00:15.079 --> 00:16.079
Hi.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.246
You won't be safe

00:17.289 --> 00:18.934
<i>until the public knows
what you know</i>

00:18.958 --> 00:20.040
<i>about Project Noah.</i>

00:20.084 --> 00:21.708
Take cover. Stay low.

00:23.837 --> 00:24.920
Lacey.

00:24.964 --> 00:27.047
You don't leave me,
I don't leave you.

00:27.091 --> 00:28.882
<i>Maybe she's a good girl
after all.</i>

00:31.178 --> 00:33.804
Lot of the guys
are having nightmares.

00:33.847 --> 00:35.242
- Are you?
- It's just cabin fever.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.932
Babcock likes to stare at you.

00:36.976 --> 00:38.350
She doesn't stare at me.

00:39.562 --> 00:41.853
Hey, baby. I missed you.

00:46.443 --> 00:48.902
When was the last time you were
with a man, Babcock?

00:48.946 --> 00:49.903
Get off of me.

00:51.267 --> 00:53.434
- Bitch!

00:53.477 --> 00:56.353
What the hell is going on here?

00:56.397 --> 00:58.606
You were supposed to escort her
to intake.

01:00.192 --> 01:02.851
We were just having
a little fun.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.528
Oh, you were just
having fun, huh?

01:04.572 --> 01:06.363
You having fun now?

01:06.407 --> 01:08.991
Is this fun? Hmm?

01:11.028 --> 01:13.829
You must be Shauna Babcock.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.498
Clark Richards.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.375
Nice to meet you.

01:18.419 --> 01:21.670
Why am I still looking at you?

01:21.714 --> 01:23.672
Get out of here.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.523 --> 01:41.460
- That was scary.
- What is this place?

01:41.484 --> 01:42.650
You okay?

01:42.693 --> 01:46.278
It seemed like a good deal,
but...

01:46.322 --> 01:48.489
Why don't you just take
a moment?

01:51.410 --> 01:55.329
- Thank you for...
- No. Don't thank me.

01:55.373 --> 01:57.498
That never should have happened
to you.

02:03.714 --> 02:05.339
Clark Richards.

02:06.884 --> 02:09.509
Still naming people Clark, huh?

02:09.553 --> 02:13.055
I might be the last one.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.933
-I was named after
my grandfather.
-Fair enough.

02:15.977 --> 02:18.727
I'm pretty sure I'm named after
a stripper my dad knew.

02:21.232 --> 02:23.315
It smells good here in Colorado.

02:23.359 --> 02:25.317
It's freezing, though.

02:27.196 --> 02:28.654
You're from Las Vegas.

02:28.698 --> 02:31.615
Yeah. I'm a desert rat.

02:31.659 --> 02:33.951
Just a couple states over,

02:33.995 --> 02:36.495
but it does not get cold
like this.

02:38.624 --> 02:40.165
You?

02:40.209 --> 02:43.669
Just outside of Philly.

02:43.713 --> 02:46.338
Gets freezing there, too.

02:47.883 --> 02:51.093
Hey, Clark Richards, we're
talking about the weather.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.262
Yeah.

02:53.305 --> 02:56.765
Obviously, we are amazing
conversationalists.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.025
Just tell me one thing,
Clark Richards,

03:06.068 --> 03:08.068
and don't lie to me
because I'll know.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.698
Whatever they're gonna do to me
in there...

03:14.618 --> 03:17.453
...is it gonna hurt?

03:17.496 --> 03:20.748
Not one bit.

03:22.418 --> 03:25.502
Why don't we go inside
where it's warm.

03:48.069 --> 03:49.818
Induction team
is standing by. Over.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.862
I want these two secured.

03:51.906 --> 03:53.530
All stations are go.

03:59.830 --> 04:01.683
Tell me again.
What are we gonna do?

04:01.707 --> 04:04.208
- We're gonna get out of here.
- How are we gonna do it?

04:04.251 --> 04:07.669
We're gonna listen more
than we talk.

04:07.713 --> 04:09.399
We're gonna remember
and notice everything.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.798
And we're gonna be ready.

04:10.841 --> 04:12.257
Good. What are we not gonna do?

04:12.301 --> 04:14.384
Panic.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.352
Watch your step.

04:35.282 --> 04:37.199
Amy.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.451
Amy, I'll find you.

04:39.495 --> 04:41.870
I promise.

04:51.757 --> 04:53.423
Hmm? Maybe she's been...

04:58.305 --> 04:59.888
Help! Help!

04:59.932 --> 05:01.515
Oh, help!

05:01.559 --> 05:03.392
Help!

05:03.435 --> 05:05.269
How the hell did this happen?

05:05.312 --> 05:08.597
Uh, she reached through
the bars, grabbed a sweep

05:08.607 --> 05:10.607
and drank him dry in about
90 seconds.

05:10.651 --> 05:12.234
Welcome home.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.819
Okay.

05:15.447 --> 05:17.489
There.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.576
Simmons kicks your badge
into Babcock's cage.

05:20.619 --> 05:22.536
Uh, th-that's right.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.538
Why would he do that?

05:24.582 --> 05:25.582
He's a dick.

05:25.624 --> 05:29.251
Uh, was, ma'am.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.503
You know, Babcock could
easily have grabbed your arm,

05:31.547 --> 05:33.163
but she doesn't.

05:33.174 --> 05:35.257
But she takes Simmons.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.250
Why do you think she made
that choice, Grey?

05:37.261 --> 05:38.738
Jonas, the virus
debilitates the neocortex.

05:38.762 --> 05:42.556
She has the decision-making
capability of a piranha.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.467
Uh, maybe she knows
I belong to Fanning.

05:45.477 --> 05:47.394
- Oy.
- What? I'm sorry?

05:47.438 --> 05:48.604
You belong to Fanning?

05:48.647 --> 05:50.230
Yeah. I-I-I mean,

05:50.274 --> 05:51.501
I-I'm in charge
of Fanning's cage.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.642
She hated Simmons.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.485
He-he was a dick to her, too.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.729
This is really hard
to listen to.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.259
No. I saw it myself.
This sweep abused her.

05:59.283 --> 06:01.491
He banged on her cage,
made lewd gestures,

06:01.535 --> 06:03.346
- turned the lights on her.
- Wait, you're saying

06:03.370 --> 06:05.537
that this was revenge?
Are you kidding me?

06:05.581 --> 06:07.184
Maybe Simmons smelled better
than Grey.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.917
Yeah, right.
It was a hygiene issue.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.169
- Look, what if it was revenge?
- Okay, enough.

06:12.213 --> 06:14.129
This is the first viral kill

06:14.173 --> 06:15.775
in the three years that Project
Noah has been in operation.

06:15.799 --> 06:17.507
What do we do about Babcock?

06:17.551 --> 06:19.426
I know what they'd do
at the zoo.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.595
They'd put her down.

06:21.639 --> 06:22.824
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with that.

06:22.848 --> 06:24.451
I mean, we may not want
to admit it,

06:24.475 --> 06:25.933
but she's still partly human.

06:25.976 --> 06:27.559
Jonas, her cerebral activity

06:27.603 --> 06:29.353
is basically nonexistent.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.650
Do it.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.028
Euthanize her.

06:38.072 --> 06:40.364
It's a security issue.

06:43.244 --> 06:45.911
Okay, but you won't fix
the real problem.

06:45.955 --> 06:47.246
Which is?

06:47.289 --> 06:49.081
The nightmares?

06:49.124 --> 06:52.125
Half of everyone with 4B
clearance is having them.

06:52.169 --> 06:54.711
I'm not having nightmares.
Anybody else?

06:54.755 --> 06:56.088
Jonas, this is a stressful

06:56.131 --> 06:57.923
and lonely environment.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.676
I'd be surprised if people
weren't having bad dreams.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.324
Major Sykes,
they need you upstairs.

07:04.348 --> 07:06.848
There's an issue
with the little girl.

07:06.892 --> 07:09.893
There's a kid here?
W-Why is there a kid here?

07:09.937 --> 07:11.770
Back to your post, Grey.

07:21.699 --> 07:23.773
- Don't you touch me!
- We're just trying to...

07:23.784 --> 07:25.303
Nobody's putting any needle
in me!

07:25.327 --> 07:27.911
And I'm not putting
that paper gown on either!

07:27.955 --> 07:29.808
- Don't you touch me.
- Easy. Easy.

07:29.832 --> 07:31.331
Don't touch me!

07:35.546 --> 07:37.713
Hi, Amy.

07:39.758 --> 07:41.049
I'm Dr. Sykes.

07:45.180 --> 07:46.847
I know you're scared and angry.

07:46.890 --> 07:48.827
Nobody asked me
if I wanted to come here.

07:48.851 --> 07:50.434
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

07:50.477 --> 07:52.561
Okay, well, here's the thing.

07:52.604 --> 07:56.514
There are a lot of sick people
in the world,

07:56.525 --> 07:59.109
and you could help us save
millions of them.

07:59.153 --> 08:02.446
You might be the most important
little girl in the world.

08:02.489 --> 08:05.490
You're gonna help us come up
with a cure

08:05.534 --> 08:08.452
for a really dangerous disease.

08:08.495 --> 08:12.372
What's gonna happen to me?

08:12.416 --> 08:15.584
I realize you have no reason
to trust me.

08:15.627 --> 08:18.670
But I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you. I swear.

08:18.714 --> 08:20.567
You can put that promise
in your pocket

08:20.591 --> 08:23.884
and take it out any time
you get scared, okay?

08:26.388 --> 08:29.431
What can I do right now
to make you feel better?

08:29.475 --> 08:31.350
I want the agent.

08:48.410 --> 08:49.743
You did the old guy in Bolivia.

08:49.787 --> 08:51.828
- What was that like?
- Paulson.

08:51.872 --> 08:54.206
We're not taking
any unnecessary risks.

08:54.249 --> 08:56.166
Safety's the priority here.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.294
Gas her, move her to
the isolation cell

08:59.338 --> 09:02.547
on the other side of the unit,
and then use the lights.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.334
Why aren't Fanning
and Babcock eating?

09:42.172 --> 09:44.464
Tough break, kid.

09:44.508 --> 09:47.834
One cheat meal and you're back
on death row.

09:47.845 --> 09:50.220
Tell you what, it was worth it

09:50.264 --> 09:52.347
just to be in charge
for 90 seconds.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.391
Human blood's not bad, either.

09:54.435 --> 09:56.184
I think we can be pretty certain

09:56.228 --> 09:59.146
that impulse control is your
bÃªte noire, hmm?

09:59.189 --> 10:01.898
- Can you get out of here?

10:01.942 --> 10:04.526
Trying to lighten the mood.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.486
Sorry.

10:06.530 --> 10:07.946
You need a plan.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.448
We need you on the team.

10:09.491 --> 10:10.885
Fanning, my life's just been
a series

10:10.909 --> 10:12.720
of things that have happened
to me.

10:12.744 --> 10:15.287
Maybe it's time to call it.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.873
Who's that talking, Shauna?
'Cause that is not you.

10:19.668 --> 10:21.877
At the dinner table,

10:21.920 --> 10:23.565
there's only one thing
you're doing

10:23.589 --> 10:25.881
if you're not eating, right?

10:29.344 --> 10:30.635
You're talking.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.345
<i>Here's a promise.</i>

10:32.389 --> 10:35.640
Stick to the plan, and one day,

10:35.684 --> 10:38.810
human blood, as sweet as it is,
will bore you,

10:38.854 --> 10:41.521
because you'll be guzzling it
by the gallon

10:41.565 --> 10:45.066
every day for a hundred years.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.270
Damn, Fanning,

10:49.281 --> 10:51.531
that was semi-biblical.

10:51.575 --> 10:55.494
You have a lot more power than
you think, Shauna. Use it.

10:58.749 --> 11:01.666
Tell him your story.

11:01.710 --> 11:05.295
Make him see you.

11:05.339 --> 11:08.048
Richards,
bring Wolgast to Amy's room.

11:10.802 --> 11:14.513
There are new details emerging
in the case of Brad Wolgast,

11:14.556 --> 11:17.140
the former FBI agent wanted
in the kidnapping

11:17.184 --> 11:18.244
of a ten-year-old girl.

11:18.268 --> 11:20.038
Wolgast was shot
and killed Tuesday

11:20.062 --> 11:22.312
by federal agents
after murdering three employees

11:22.356 --> 11:24.856
in this North Duluth, Minnesota
sheriff's station.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.192
I'm Sierra Thompson.
I'll have more on this story

11:27.236 --> 11:28.546
in the hour.
Back to you, Jim.

11:28.570 --> 11:30.946
Thank you, Sierra.

11:30.989 --> 11:32.592
I make dead look pretty good,
right?

11:32.616 --> 11:33.907
Wolgast.

11:33.951 --> 11:35.659
You here to kill me, buddy?

11:35.702 --> 11:37.786
Depends.

11:37.829 --> 11:39.913
Right now,
I need you to come with me.

11:39.957 --> 11:42.290
Why?

11:42.334 --> 11:44.334
It's not a suggestion.

11:46.255 --> 11:47.982
And don't think
about moving on me.

11:48.006 --> 11:50.048
Don't blink.

11:52.636 --> 11:54.261
Where's Amy?

11:54.304 --> 11:55.762
She's here, in her room.

11:55.806 --> 11:57.305
She's anxious.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.431
So am I.

11:58.475 --> 12:00.350
What are you gonna do to her?

12:02.187 --> 12:04.020
Well, tell him.

12:06.108 --> 12:08.775
A bird flu pandemic
is spreading in China,

12:08.819 --> 12:11.486
and none of the existing
vaccines are working.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.197
It's moving
into the rest of Asia,

12:14.241 --> 12:15.657
and it'll be here in 60 days,

12:15.701 --> 12:17.242
maybe fewer.

12:17.286 --> 12:19.536
What we're doing
could save millions.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.746
Amy gets us there faster.

12:21.790 --> 12:23.665
- Why?
- Because she's a child.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.585
Her central nervous system
is more plastic.

12:26.628 --> 12:28.461
This new bleeding
heart of yours is getting

12:28.505 --> 12:30.505
on my nerves.
You're part of this.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.549
Not anymore.

12:32.593 --> 12:34.718
How are you not in jail?

12:34.761 --> 12:35.844
She's getting the shot.

12:35.887 --> 12:37.137
That's what's happening.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.783
Now, do you want
to hold her hand

12:38.807 --> 12:40.927
or you want me to take you back
to your room?

12:46.440 --> 12:48.315
Okay.

12:50.152 --> 12:52.360
If anything happens to the girl,

12:52.404 --> 12:55.655
I'm coming after all three
of you.

12:55.699 --> 12:56.948
Okay. Great.

12:56.992 --> 12:58.533
Come on.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.459
I already sat helplessly
by a child's hospital bed

13:07.502 --> 13:08.793
in this lifetime.

13:08.837 --> 13:10.003
You knew that.

13:19.806 --> 13:21.848
Hey.

13:23.894 --> 13:25.580
What did we say
about not panicking?

13:25.604 --> 13:26.604
I didn't panic.

13:26.647 --> 13:28.313
Got you here, didn't I?

13:30.025 --> 13:32.400
Hi.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.823
So, I counted the steps
from the elevator to this room.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.283
26.

13:40.327 --> 13:41.910
Probably less for you.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.622
Because your legs are longer.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.876
Good work.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.419
What's this?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.579
They put a chip in me.

13:53.590 --> 13:55.693
They say it's there
to see what my body's doing.

13:55.717 --> 13:58.510
But I think it's there to see
if you sneak me out of here.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.518
Let me.

14:30.961 --> 14:32.335
Don't look at that.

14:32.379 --> 14:33.878
Look at me.

14:59.823 --> 15:03.032
What are you gonna do to her?

15:09.425 --> 15:12.760
<i>You have a lot more
power than you think, Shauna.</i>

15:21.020 --> 15:23.855
<i>Tell him your story.</i>

15:45.628 --> 15:47.545
Okay, I think we got it, Shauna.

15:47.589 --> 15:48.796
Did you get it real close?

15:48.840 --> 15:49.900
I need that for my portfolio.

15:49.924 --> 15:51.757
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

15:54.304 --> 15:57.305
Oh, it's super disgusting, dude.

15:57.348 --> 15:58.973
You're so pretty.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.703
Why do you want to make yourself
look so gross?

16:00.727 --> 16:01.809
Because it's awesome.

16:01.853 --> 16:03.394
Is this for makeup school?

16:03.438 --> 16:05.749
Special effects makeup.
There's this school out in L.A.

16:05.773 --> 16:07.376
I got to get the hell
out of Vegas

16:07.400 --> 16:08.649
before I turn into my mom.

16:08.693 --> 16:10.943
This place is gonna suck me dry.

16:10.987 --> 16:13.696
You guys...

16:13.740 --> 16:15.281
I hate my costume.

16:15.325 --> 16:18.200
Is it because your horn looks
like a massive penis?

16:18.244 --> 16:20.453
Yeah, maybe.

16:21.623 --> 16:22.997
Come on, help me out, Shauna.

16:56.824 --> 16:58.741
- You're beautiful.
- Shut up.

17:04.332 --> 17:06.540
- Hey, you wanna get out of here?
- What? No.

17:06.584 --> 17:08.896
- I thought you liked it rough.
- What are you doing? Stop.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.670
Can I have this?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.842
Whoa! What the hell?
You psycho bitch!

17:16.886 --> 17:19.971
Sorry, did you say something?
Get your hands off my friend.

17:20.013 --> 17:21.555
Don't...

17:21.598 --> 17:23.473
Are you okay?

17:24.519 --> 17:27.269
Hey, break it up.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.438
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

17:32.694 --> 17:34.360
Let's go.

17:34.404 --> 17:37.571
<i>Sir. Sir. Yo!</i>

17:37.615 --> 17:40.616
<i>Are you waiting for that coffee
to do something,</i>

17:40.660 --> 17:42.076
or can I get in there?

17:47.417 --> 17:48.791
Yeah.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.878
<i>What do you got?</i>

17:52.922 --> 17:55.381
Three of a kind beats two pair?

17:55.416 --> 17:56.841
Unfortunately for me, it does.

17:56.884 --> 17:59.593
Okay.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.057
How are we feeling today?

18:05.101 --> 18:06.851
Fine.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.618
Okay, good.

18:24.662 --> 18:27.663
So, now I need one deep breath.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.875
Good. Okay. One more.

18:30.918 --> 18:32.877
Okay, everything is
looking good,

18:32.920 --> 18:34.960
and I will see you
in a couple of hours.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.604
Seven, four, nine.

18:51.647 --> 18:52.875
I missed the last two numbers.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.691
I'll work out the rest.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.278
Oh, I heard a man talking
in the room next door.

18:59.322 --> 19:01.489
He has a nice voice.

19:01.532 --> 19:03.074
I think his name is Anthony.

19:07.455 --> 19:09.330
How about we get some sleep?

19:09.373 --> 19:11.540
- I'm not tired.
- No?

19:11.584 --> 19:14.794
That was a pretty big yawn
you did back there.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.629
Come on.

19:18.966 --> 19:21.458
Take your slippers off.

19:21.469 --> 19:22.676
Whenever I close my eyes,

19:22.720 --> 19:24.615
I feel like somebody's
watching me.

19:24.639 --> 19:27.098
It's just me. Come on.

19:29.352 --> 19:31.080
How 'bout I check
the closet for monsters?

19:31.104 --> 19:32.686
Hmm?

19:36.818 --> 19:38.651
No. No monsters.

19:41.364 --> 19:42.696
How about under the bed?

19:42.740 --> 19:46.367
- You hiding monsters
under here? No.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.494
Just the floor.

19:50.581 --> 19:52.498
It's just us here.

19:54.252 --> 19:56.377
I don't like this place.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.340
Let's just get out
of here, okay?

19:58.381 --> 20:00.923
Okay.

20:13.271 --> 20:16.564
Hey. Who the hell are you?

20:16.607 --> 20:18.377
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

20:18.401 --> 20:19.753
- I just wanted to... I just...
- What's happening?

20:19.777 --> 20:20.943
I-I-I'm sorry.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.653
You just wanted to what?

20:22.697 --> 20:25.531
I just wanted to warn you.

20:25.575 --> 20:29.660
- I just wanted to...
- Hey. Hey, hey.

20:29.704 --> 20:32.288
I just wanted to warn you.
He-He's gonna come for her.

20:33.694 --> 20:35.569
- Who?
- Fanning.

20:35.613 --> 20:37.988
- Who's Fanning?
- Patient zero, man.

20:38.032 --> 20:39.885
- He-he makes you do things.
- All right. Okay.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.178
Calm down.
Maybe I can help you.

20:41.202 --> 20:42.262
What does Fanning want?

20:42.286 --> 20:43.786
Everything. Everything.

20:43.829 --> 20:45.641
Just please get her out of here.

20:45.665 --> 20:46.914
Tell me where to find him.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.166
- 4B, with the rest of them.
- Hey...

20:52.171 --> 20:54.046
Come on, move.

21:06.102 --> 21:07.246
Like I don't have
anything better to do

21:07.270 --> 21:09.937
than pick you up
at a police station.

21:09.981 --> 21:12.773
Yeah, I'm sure DeMarco Plumbing
really grinds to a halt

21:12.817 --> 21:15.192
if you're not there
to file their invoices.

21:24.704 --> 21:26.807
What the hell were you doing
last night, Shauna?

21:26.831 --> 21:28.747
Well, I'll tell you.

21:28.791 --> 21:30.727
The evening started
at a warehouse party

21:30.751 --> 21:32.563
that I used a fake ID
to get into.

21:32.587 --> 21:35.754
We drank, we took Molly.
Well, actually,

21:35.798 --> 21:37.734
I think it was Molly;
it was a little speedy,

21:37.758 --> 21:39.675
so who really knows? Then,

21:39.719 --> 21:41.710
I saw some gross guy
getting handsy with Hayley,

21:41.721 --> 21:43.762
so I slashed his arm
with a beer bottle.

21:43.806 --> 21:47.141
And that's why I'm being awarded
the medal for heroism.

21:47.184 --> 21:49.885
Yeah.

21:49.895 --> 21:51.186
Is this it?

21:51.230 --> 21:53.083
Is this the best
you can do, Shauna?

21:53.107 --> 21:54.648
You know what my plan is.

21:54.692 --> 21:56.169
I'm gonna do special effects
makeup for movies.

21:56.193 --> 21:58.736
I'm moving to L.A. I already
have three grand saved.

21:58.779 --> 22:00.757
You won't follow through.
Your life's just a series

22:00.781 --> 22:02.615
of things that happen to you.

22:02.658 --> 22:04.867
You're not gonna move to L.A.
and work in makeup.

22:06.037 --> 22:08.412
You're just gonna waste
that money.

22:08.456 --> 22:10.706
We both know it.

22:14.045 --> 22:16.879
Wash your face.

22:16.922 --> 22:19.882
You're a horror show.

22:45.826 --> 22:47.409
Heard you got in trouble again.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.286
Thanks for your concern.

22:54.210 --> 22:55.854
Were you and your friends
wearing some slutty

22:55.878 --> 22:58.962
Halloween costumes with your
panties hanging out?

22:59.006 --> 23:02.383
Danny, it is really important
you never say

23:02.426 --> 23:05.135
the word "panties"
in front of me again.

23:15.147 --> 23:17.731
You used to be nicer to me.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.878
Yeah, well, I don't really know
what to tell you, Danny.

23:19.902 --> 23:23.070
With age comes wisdom.

23:23.114 --> 23:25.239
I'm serious, get out of my room.

23:28.244 --> 23:30.160
Sure.

23:31.664 --> 23:35.165
You're a smart-ass,
you know that?

23:35.209 --> 23:37.292
<i>You're a smart-ass,
you know that?</i>

23:45.886 --> 23:47.261
Where'd you go?

23:49.181 --> 23:50.723
How's she doing?

23:50.766 --> 23:53.308
It's early.

23:53.352 --> 23:56.186
But we're pushing
a new prophylactic anti-viral.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.147
And I did another knockout study

23:58.190 --> 24:00.110
before we gave her
the shot, so...

24:02.987 --> 24:05.988
Clark.

24:06.031 --> 24:10.868
This kid has to make it or...
I don't know.

24:10.911 --> 24:12.953
She will.

24:12.997 --> 24:14.788
I have faith in you.

24:19.962 --> 24:21.503
Are you sure you're okay?

24:21.547 --> 24:23.964
What do you mean?

24:24.008 --> 24:27.634
I don't know, you...
you seem distracted.

24:27.678 --> 24:29.678
I thought maybe it was Babcock.

24:29.722 --> 24:32.139
It's happening
at midnight, right?

24:32.183 --> 24:34.016
Yeah.

24:34.059 --> 24:35.976
We killed her once.

24:36.020 --> 24:38.228
What does it matter
if we kill her again?

24:38.272 --> 24:41.398
Do you think,
after this is all over,

24:41.442 --> 24:46.403
we can walk out of here
and lead a normal life?

24:46.447 --> 24:50.240
We answered the call of duty.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.159
So, yeah, we will.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.456
I got to go check on Wolgast.

25:05.633 --> 25:08.342
Room check. Step outside.

25:09.470 --> 25:12.262
Can I go to the bathroom,
please?

25:19.021 --> 25:22.889
And here I was thinking
that irony was dead.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.776
I know I was on the wrong side
of this. I'm sorry.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.778
Well, that makes it all okay.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.242
You seem good.

25:33.285 --> 25:35.327
I know, I look good, right?

25:35.371 --> 25:39.122
And I-I feel strong, alert.

25:42.002 --> 25:43.335
Something's not right?

25:43.370 --> 25:44.753
I don't know what it is,

25:44.797 --> 25:46.255
but it's coming.

25:49.134 --> 25:50.843
Who's the girl?

25:50.886 --> 25:53.011
And is she on death row, too?

25:58.686 --> 26:01.103
Does the name "Fanning"
mean anything to you?

26:01.146 --> 26:02.896
This guy came into Amy's room,

26:02.940 --> 26:04.835
and he said that he's
gonna be coming for her.

26:04.859 --> 26:08.026
Fanning's in my head.

26:08.070 --> 26:09.695
He's in my dreams.

26:09.738 --> 26:11.822
I think he runs this place.

26:11.866 --> 26:14.116
You'd best be on your toes,
Agent Wolgast.

26:25.838 --> 26:28.881
Brad, walk with me.

26:28.924 --> 26:30.424
I've got a couple of questions.

27:20.935 --> 27:24.436
Hi... to...

27:24.480 --> 27:26.188
you.

27:43.832 --> 27:46.750
Hi. Uh, could you
answer a question

27:46.794 --> 27:48.377
about Martin Echols?

27:48.420 --> 27:51.004
He was on death row
at your facility.

27:55.844 --> 27:58.428
Hi, I need to speak to your boss
about Julio Martinez.

27:58.514 --> 28:00.434
He was on death row
at your prison.

28:04.019 --> 28:05.769
Florence McClure
Correctional Center,

28:05.813 --> 28:06.937
Darlene speaking.

28:06.981 --> 28:08.814
Hi, Darlene.

28:08.857 --> 28:12.901
I'm looking for some information
on Shauna Babcock.

28:12.945 --> 28:15.862
Why?

28:15.906 --> 28:19.449
I'm interested in the details
of her death.

28:19.493 --> 28:24.663
Um, 12 death row inmates
have died mysteriously

28:24.707 --> 28:26.081
before their execution dates,

28:26.125 --> 28:28.291
and no one wants
to talk about it.

28:31.130 --> 28:32.295
Darlene?

28:32.339 --> 28:34.673
Is there something
you want to tell me?

28:34.717 --> 28:37.134
Shauna Babcock didn't die here.

28:37.177 --> 28:40.220
She was taken away
by federal agents.

28:40.264 --> 28:43.890
I knew it was wrong.

28:45.394 --> 28:47.519
- What are we doing?
- You're on a break.

28:49.898 --> 28:51.773
I need you to confirm something.

28:51.808 --> 28:53.275
Yeah, I need a few things, too.

28:53.318 --> 28:55.296
Was Shauna Babcock planning
to go to makeup school in L.A.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.987
before things went sideways?

28:57.031 --> 28:58.697
That's what you need to confirm?

28:58.741 --> 29:00.490
Yes or no?

29:02.036 --> 29:04.995
Sure. That was her plan.

29:06.623 --> 29:08.874
Why does that matter?

29:08.917 --> 29:10.729
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

29:10.753 --> 29:13.086
Is there any history
of sexual violence?

29:13.130 --> 29:14.379
Anything like that?

29:14.423 --> 29:16.343
Are you writing a book
about her?

29:18.052 --> 29:22.012
The stepfather. Ugly story.

29:22.056 --> 29:23.742
- Was inadmissible.
- How'd you get her to come here,

29:23.766 --> 29:25.682
take the deal with Project Noah?

29:25.726 --> 29:28.894
Everybody in that girl's life
let her down.

29:28.937 --> 29:30.999
I presented myself
as someone who wouldn't.

29:31.023 --> 29:33.857
You know what I'm starting
to think?

29:33.901 --> 29:36.902
Nobody gets over anything.

29:36.945 --> 29:39.946
They say time helps,
but it doesn't, does it?

29:39.990 --> 29:43.158
It's... it's just another lie.

29:45.204 --> 29:47.037
You and I have seen the worst

29:47.081 --> 29:48.850
of what human beings do
to each other.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.334
You never cracked.
You're losing it now.

29:52.377 --> 29:54.294
Tell me why.

29:55.798 --> 29:57.330
You're being dramatic.

29:57.341 --> 29:58.131
Who's Fanning?

29:58.175 --> 30:00.717
I know he's patient zero.

30:00.761 --> 30:02.322
I know I didn't bring him here,
and I know that he's

30:02.346 --> 30:03.845
in people's dreams.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.347
What the hell is going on here?

30:05.390 --> 30:06.743
What did you put
in that little girl's arm?

30:06.767 --> 30:08.536
- This conversation is over.
- No.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.246
No, no, no, you answer me.
Tell me what you did

30:10.270 --> 30:11.623
-to those people that
I brought here.
-Just take him away.

30:11.647 --> 30:13.980
- Who is Fanning?
- Get him out of here.

30:14.024 --> 30:15.857
What's gonna happen to Amy?

30:24.785 --> 30:25.887
You've been avoiding me.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.662
Uh, I'm-I'm busy.

30:28.705 --> 30:29.705
I-I can't...

30:29.748 --> 30:31.957
What do you need from me?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.376
- Oh, no, no. Wha-What?
- Your dreams.

30:34.419 --> 30:36.628
They're about Fanning.

30:36.672 --> 30:37.879
Uh-huh.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.841
Can you tell me
when they started?

30:40.884 --> 30:45.220
Around the time the second
or third subject showed up.

30:45.264 --> 30:49.141
They were just,
like, wispy pictures at first.

30:49.184 --> 30:52.185
So they changed
is what you're saying.

30:52.229 --> 30:55.981
Uh, yeah, they got
more real, longer.

30:56.024 --> 30:58.150
Movies I couldn't escape...

31:00.737 --> 31:02.320
That I couldn't escape from.

31:02.364 --> 31:05.157
Does Fanning ever talk to you
in his dreams?

31:05.200 --> 31:06.741
He does now.

31:06.785 --> 31:08.827
That started after
Babcock arrived.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.017
- What does he say?
- The last thing he told me

31:13.041 --> 31:16.117
was, um...

31:16.128 --> 31:18.170
"We have work to do."

31:20.257 --> 31:22.007
Sierra.

31:22.050 --> 31:25.135
- Sierra. Sierra, can I...
- Excuse me.

31:25.179 --> 31:27.679
My name is Lila Wolgast.
I'm Brad Wolgast's ex-wife.

31:27.723 --> 31:29.075
I-I-I left you, like,
four messages.

31:29.099 --> 31:30.265
You never called me back.

31:30.309 --> 31:31.411
Which should have been
your first clue

31:31.435 --> 31:32.851
that I wasn't interested.

31:32.895 --> 31:34.686
Brad's alive.

31:34.730 --> 31:37.898
He was not shot and killed
at the sheriff's station.

31:37.941 --> 31:39.941
You have ten seconds.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.527
In the last three years,
12 death row inmates

31:42.571 --> 31:45.989
from 12 different prisons
supposedly died unexpectedly

31:46.033 --> 31:47.886
before their sentences
could be carried out.

31:47.910 --> 31:49.451
Do you have names?

31:49.494 --> 31:51.264
They were sent to a government
facility in Colorado

31:51.288 --> 31:54.789
to be used as guinea pigs for
top secret medical experiments.

31:54.833 --> 31:58.084
You don't have anything
resembling proof, do you?

31:58.128 --> 32:01.162
An administrator from
the Florence McClure

32:01.173 --> 32:03.067
Women's Correctional Center
can confirm

32:03.091 --> 32:05.250
Shauna Babcock didn't die there.

32:05.260 --> 32:07.302
She was taken by
two federal agents.

32:07.346 --> 32:09.596
My husband was one of them.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.848
I'll look into this.

32:11.892 --> 32:13.892
If it checks out,
you'll hear from me.

32:21.735 --> 32:23.235
Hey, I gotta hit the head again.

32:23.278 --> 32:25.195
Do you have backup?

32:25.239 --> 32:26.738
Copy. Steve's here.

32:29.993 --> 32:32.535
Guard? I need a guard.

32:32.579 --> 32:33.995
What do you need, Carter?

32:34.039 --> 32:36.665
I'm thirsty.
I need some water.

32:39.962 --> 32:41.920
I'll be back in a flash.

32:41.964 --> 32:44.124
I'm gonna go see
what's really under the bed.

33:19.126 --> 33:21.209
- 4B, please.
- Um, I can't.

33:21.253 --> 33:24.004
You got to get out...

34:41.123 --> 34:43.500
I guess now is a good time
to talk.

34:49.632 --> 34:51.216
All right. We have three minutes

34:51.259 --> 34:54.302
before the surveillance system's
back online.

34:54.346 --> 34:56.804
Oh, my God.

34:58.892 --> 35:01.184
I brought all these people here.

35:01.228 --> 35:03.081
We thought we could
cure all diseases,

35:03.105 --> 35:06.147
create universal immunity,

35:06.191 --> 35:09.359
exponentially increase
life expectancy.

35:11.279 --> 35:13.530
Doesn't look like
it's going very well.

35:13.573 --> 35:15.365
We created a new species,

35:15.409 --> 35:17.470
and we're just beginning
to understand what these virals

35:17.494 --> 35:18.910
are capable of.

35:18.954 --> 35:21.121
We thought they were catatonic,

35:21.164 --> 35:25.125
but I think they're talking
to each other.

35:27.462 --> 35:30.004
This isn't science anymore.

35:33.385 --> 35:36.219
This janitor, I guess,

35:36.263 --> 35:39.848
Grey? He told me that Fanning
was coming for Amy.

35:39.891 --> 35:41.975
What does that mean?

35:42.060 --> 35:43.435
I don't know.

35:43.478 --> 35:46.479
Fanning's patient zero.
We created these virals

35:46.523 --> 35:50.024
from attenuated, genetically
altered versions of his blood.

35:50.068 --> 35:53.027
You keep saying "virals,"
but they drink blood,

35:53.071 --> 35:54.863
burn to ash in the sun.

35:54.906 --> 35:56.759
Why don't you just
call them vampires?

35:56.783 --> 35:59.742
'Cause we're scientists,
Agent Wolgast,

35:59.786 --> 36:01.786
and there's no such thing
as vampires.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.708
With each new subject turned,

36:06.751 --> 36:09.210
I think he's gotten
more powerful.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.838
What does Fanning want?

36:11.882 --> 36:15.300
What any prisoner wants,
I would imagine.

36:15.343 --> 36:17.218
To be free.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.893
Hey.

36:24.936 --> 36:27.854
- Hey.

36:27.898 --> 36:29.397
How you feeling?

36:29.441 --> 36:31.316
Better.

36:32.986 --> 36:36.654
Um, is that a good idea?

36:36.698 --> 36:39.440
- While you're taking pain meds?
- I'm not taking the pain meds.

36:39.451 --> 36:42.118
I like to feel it,
so it doesn't dilute my anger

36:42.162 --> 36:44.204
at the individuals who shot me.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.707
Great.

36:50.587 --> 36:52.086
Hello?

36:52.130 --> 36:53.588
It's Sierra Thompson.

36:53.632 --> 36:55.831
- I looked into your story.
- And?

36:55.842 --> 36:57.926
There are a lot
of holes, and a lot

36:57.969 --> 37:00.156
of unanswered questions,
but there's something to it.

37:00.180 --> 37:02.639
Fantastic.

37:02.682 --> 37:04.202
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll meet and make a plan.

37:04.226 --> 37:07.477
Okay. Great.

37:34.423 --> 37:36.298
- You read my mind.
- Okay.

37:36.342 --> 37:39.051
Hey, I need that.

38:20.553 --> 38:23.137
<i>Where's my money?</i>

38:23.180 --> 38:25.180
Where's my money?

38:25.224 --> 38:27.182
You took it. Where is it?

38:28.019 --> 38:29.727
I didn't take your money.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.874
Yeah, you did.
I know because your stupid head

38:31.898 --> 38:34.481
is made of glass and the hamster
that you're using as a brain

38:34.525 --> 38:37.401
- looks guilty. Where is it?
- Calm down, Shauna.

38:37.445 --> 38:39.653
God...

38:39.697 --> 38:42.156
I needed to cover
something, okay?

38:42.199 --> 38:44.116
You son of a bitch.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.076
Hey! You're crazy.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.245
- She's crazy.
- Go watch your game.

38:48.289 --> 38:51.415
I-I'll handle this, okay?
Shauna, take a walk.

38:51.459 --> 38:55.544
-You know what
that money meant to me!
-Take a walk, Shauna.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.838
I don't want to take a walk.
I want my money back!

38:57.882 --> 39:00.257
Not everything
is about you, Shauna.

39:00.301 --> 39:02.195
Yeah, 'cause everything's
about Danny.

39:02.219 --> 39:04.136
He's a good man.

39:07.183 --> 39:09.558
Do you think that?

39:09.602 --> 39:12.394
Do you really think that?

39:12.438 --> 39:14.730
He's my man.

39:19.612 --> 39:22.029
He is a rapist.

39:38.756 --> 39:42.174
Any time you're ready, sir.

39:50.393 --> 39:53.477
<i>He is a rapist.</i>

39:53.521 --> 39:55.646
He is a rapist.

40:01.737 --> 40:03.737
Mom.

40:05.992 --> 40:07.533
Mom.

40:07.576 --> 40:11.578
Please react
to what I just said.

40:11.622 --> 40:13.622
<i>Please react
to what I just said.</i>

40:23.050 --> 40:25.467
<i>Please react
to what I just said.</i>

40:28.259 --> 40:30.343
Is he?

40:30.387 --> 40:34.347
Is he really, Shauna?

40:38.871 --> 40:43.415
He started coming into my room
when I was eight,

40:43.459 --> 40:47.294
and he kept doing it
until I was 16.

40:50.508 --> 40:53.008
Oh, my God.

40:53.052 --> 40:56.178
You knew.

40:56.222 --> 40:59.473
You knew
and you didn't do anything.

40:59.559 --> 41:02.309
You told me you would
always protect me.

41:02.353 --> 41:04.311
And I believed you.

41:04.355 --> 41:07.189
But you didn't.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.400
You lied to me.

41:09.443 --> 41:11.485
Danny's a pussycat.

41:11.529 --> 41:14.530
You could have said no.

41:27.044 --> 41:29.086
What's going on in there?

41:29.130 --> 41:32.256
Val, you okay?

42:09.879 --> 42:11.754
Hey. Where'd you go?

42:11.797 --> 42:15.257
Just snooping.
Getting the lay of the land.

42:15.301 --> 42:18.052
Is everything okay?

42:20.097 --> 42:22.097
Yeah.

42:22.141 --> 42:24.516
No monsters under the bed.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.560
Okay.

43:13.109 --> 43:15.401
Word to the wise,

43:15.444 --> 43:18.529
stay out of my way,
Agent Wolgast.
