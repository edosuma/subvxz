Hey, Marylin.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.913
- Thank you, Henry.
- Have a good day.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.568
- And you, too.
- Keep smiling, all right?

01:45.975 --> 01:55.115
MAIN TITLE

02:09.346 --> 02:10.869
Now, take a look

02:10.913 --> 02:14.656
at Picasso's
Guernicafor example.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.876
The severity
of the screams,

02:17.920 --> 02:21.880
they're crying out
in anguish.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.970
They're trapped
in a black and white

02:25.014 --> 02:27.364
and shades of gray world.

02:27.408 --> 02:31.368
They're being devoured
and destroyed.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.153
Do you see it?

02:35.416 --> 02:40.247
No, but you do,
and that's cool.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.684
Good night, Security Bob.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.990
Randy.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.384
Randy, you forgot your--

03:27.424 --> 03:31.211
YELLOW PERIL GALLERY

03:39.784 --> 03:43.745
Boring. Stale. Done.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.530
Bereft. Tragico.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.097
Si.

03:48.140 --> 03:52.057
Tell me, Butch, what does
this place lack?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.973
- Better art.
- Try again.

03:55.017 --> 03:59.543
- Um...
- What does this place lack?

03:59.587 --> 04:04.418
- You.
- Yes, me!

04:04.461 --> 04:05.984
Apologies.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.074
These artists,
they're sold

04:09.118 --> 04:11.425
in galleries
across the nation.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.079
Discovered by a two-bit
consignment store

04:14.123 --> 04:18.779
whose proprietors fancies
themselves a keen eye.

04:18.822 --> 04:23.567
This is crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.266
This--
this is not crap.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.358
RAW

04:31.401 --> 04:33.490
- This is--
- "RAW"?

04:36.841 --> 04:38.278
Yeah.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.118
- You Randall?
- Where's Bob?

04:53.162 --> 04:54.816
He got canned.
Are you Randall?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.819
Yeah, I am.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.386
Come on with me.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.824
Picasso, he was being
harassed by German soldiers.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.042
Are you Randall?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.392
One of the officers,

05:05.435 --> 05:07.394
he saw the painting...

05:07.437 --> 05:09.265
...in Picasso's apartment.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.485
You can't hang
your own art in the gallery.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.618
I didn't put
that art there.

05:14.662 --> 05:18.535
And he asked Picasso--
he said, "Did you do that?"

05:18.579 --> 05:21.059
You can't get
someone else to do it either.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.844
Bob was relieved
of his post earlier.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.628
Bob would never
leave his post.

05:24.672 --> 05:29.154
And Picasso's response
was no, you did.

05:29.198 --> 05:32.419
Please, Bob's a nice guy.
He's my friend.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.335
We're gonna have
to terminate you as well.

05:36.684 --> 05:40.427
- Terminate?
- It's vandalism, Mr. Whitsey.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.343
No, this is vandalism.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.353
Hello, this is Henry.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.183
He's up there.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.447
Thanks, bud.

06:04.581 --> 06:08.672
- Go away, Dick.
- Hey, buddy, it's me.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.108
Redlocks?

06:10.152 --> 06:13.677
Yeah. Open up
the door.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.375
You may enter.

06:16.506 --> 06:19.857
- I don't wanna enter.
- Well, I'm not leaving.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.140
Man.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.406
It smells awful
in here.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.239
I'm sorry.
I threw up.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.938
They fired me.
I'm really sorry.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.376
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't be sorry.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.945
It's okay.
It's okay, it's their loss.

07:03.988 --> 07:07.427
But I like it here.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.430
What, in the bathroom?

07:15.217 --> 07:17.915
Hey, remember
when Ma had to leave?

07:19.308 --> 07:21.179
Do you?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.965
We didn't like that either,
but there was nothing

07:24.008 --> 07:26.446
we could do about it.

07:27.229 --> 07:32.539
So what did we do, hmm?
What did we do?

07:32.582 --> 07:36.456
We moved on together,
and we found our feet.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.981
Can we do
that again?

07:40.024 --> 07:42.200
- Find our feet?
- Yeah, that's right.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.681
Find our feet.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.684
What are you smirking at?

07:48.816 --> 07:51.558
You should see
what I'm seeing, man.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.777
You're a mess.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.301
- Yeah, I'm a mess.
- Yeah.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.303
Well, I'm ready to go now.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.697
All right,
let's get out of here.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.550
Got it.

09:16.425 --> 09:20.560
You have the pleasure
of speaking to Maurizio D'Oro.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.389
- And?
- You must be RAW.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.304
I'm here to apologize.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.398
Look, I'm a lot of things

09:33.442 --> 09:36.793
and raw is definitely
one of them.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.795
But why
are you apologizing?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.884
May I come in?

09:40.928 --> 09:44.801
- Uh... sure.
- This is nice.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.806
Very well.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.594
I've come
to offer you a job.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.119
- A job?
- As I understand it,

09:58.162 --> 10:00.817
I cost you your job
at the Yellow Peril when

10:00.861 --> 10:03.820
I inquired about your artwork
hanging on display.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.083
I'm here now
to make amends.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
Oh.

10:08.477 --> 10:11.436
What's wrong?
Your work is good.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.439
You just need
guidance, refinement.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.834
You need moi.
I like your look, though.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.620
Ruggedly handsome
for a painter.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.450
Hey, Randy?

10:25.494 --> 10:27.627
Come here, buddy.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.852
This is
my brother, Randy.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.376
All right, and it's him
you owe the apology to.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.641
Randy, this
is Mr. Mazarino.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.165
Maurizio D'Oro.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.646
Maurizio of Gold, yeah.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.127
It's 'cause of him
you got fired.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.652
Have a seat.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.615
So you're RAW?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.835
RAW's an acronym for my name.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.489
It's for Randall
Andrew Whitsey.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.752
Of course it is.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.885
But also RAW,
you're more ways than one.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.497
You have talent,
but you need to cultivate it.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.631
You are but stone--
an uncut diamond.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.980
Once we have you cut,

11:17.024 --> 11:19.200
you will shine
like the gem you are.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.681
You will be brilliant.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.423
- Wait, what?
- What would you say if

11:25.467 --> 11:28.775
I told you I have a good friend
at New England Tech

11:28.818 --> 11:32.692
who can help you
expand your skills? Gratis?

11:33.257 --> 11:38.436
- A school for art?
- Precisely.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.919
Yeah, I don't know,
to me, school just teaches you

11:42.963 --> 11:45.879
things that
I'd probably never use.

11:45.922 --> 11:49.447
You're being pessimistic.
School is for people like you.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.449
There's nothing
wrong with me!

11:51.493 --> 11:53.800
I don't need your help,
and I don't need your school.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.453
- Wait, Randy.
- No, I just,

11:55.497 --> 11:57.455
I don't want to do that.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.892
I'm sorry.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.545
If you know what's good
for your brother,

12:00.589 --> 12:02.243
you'll see that
he's in my gallery

12:02.286 --> 12:04.549
tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.030
It'll be a shame to miss
the kind of opportunity

12:07.074 --> 12:10.686
that I'm prepared
to offer him. Good-bye.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.820
- Thanks for coming.
- Coat!

12:13.863 --> 12:15.735
Yeah.

13:04.348 --> 13:09.789
ARTPROV GALLERY
OPEN NOW

14:20.424 --> 14:23.384
And the boy
who can paint arrives.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.864
Hi.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.607
Come. Enter. Be amazed.
Butch, two Cabernet, chop-chop.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.174
MADCREATIV

14:31.218 --> 14:32.828
It's 11:00 a.m.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.699
Yes, of course,
make it Chardonnay.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.632
Your face.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.897
Durango, magnifico,?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.203
A rare palazzo.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.903
Of course, not so rare
for my galleria.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.995
- This one.
- The boy speaks.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.867
And it would appear
you have quite the eye.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.869
Do you like?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.653
I don't recognize
the artist

15:15.697 --> 15:18.221
and it's probably
for a good reason.

15:18.265 --> 15:23.226
It's not very good.
Why did you buy that work?

15:23.270 --> 15:26.664
I didn't.
I painted it.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.753
Come,
drink with me.

15:28.797 --> 15:31.931
Oh, do you have
iced coffee with no ice?

15:38.154 --> 15:42.028
You'll be responsible
for phones, setting up showing,

15:42.071 --> 15:45.945
helping clients with whatever
they want. Claro?

15:46.815 --> 15:50.950
- You want me to work out there?
- Yes, as a receptionist.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.954
I'd rather clean.
Can I be your custodian?

15:55.955 --> 16:00.263
A janitor?
You want to be my janitor?

16:00.307 --> 16:04.137
A janitor is often
a synonym for custodian.

16:04.180 --> 16:07.488
I have a service
that cleans for me, Randy.

16:07.531 --> 16:11.492
I would do a better job,
and it would cost you less.

16:11.535 --> 16:16.279
- A lot less.
- Mamma mia.

16:16.323 --> 16:20.980
One step back,
two steps forward, I hope.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.941
Are you sure
you want to be my janitor?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.988
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.

16:31.555 --> 16:35.820
Buongiorno, ArtProv Gallery
will be closed for renovation,

16:35.864 --> 16:39.085
and I won't be needing
your service until we reopen.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.000
Grazia, arrivederci.

Hey, Chip.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.558
Your tolerance for alcohol

Well, aren't
we feeling forward today?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.130

we need to change our filters

17:24.173 --> 17:25.521

17:25.566 --> 17:27.220
I changed the filter

every quarter

17:28.612 --> 17:30.223

No, like the kickball game
out in the parking lot.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.277
Oh, I don't like sports.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.802
Oh, well, you have

17:44.846 --> 17:46.587

18:05.954 --> 18:10.611
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.614
- Wow, that was really good.
- I think I can do better.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.616
No, please, don't.

- Oh!

19:09.496 --> 19:12.325
- Idiot! God!
- It was an accident.

These pants

My family already owns you.
Let's go.

He doesn't want it.

You want some more?
Whoa, hold on.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.594
RAW

21:31.638 --> 21:33.292
RAW.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.121
RAW is an acronym
for my name.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.515
It's Randall
Andrew Whitsey.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.127
Did you paint that?

21:43.171 --> 21:47.044
- Yeah.
- It's very nice.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.133
Thank you.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.048
Hey, can you tell Harry
that I said thanks?

21:51.092 --> 21:54.400
His name is Henry,
but I call him Redlocks.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.837
I get that, Redlocks.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.839
Red hair.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.841
Well, tell him
I said thanks.

22:00.884 --> 22:07.326
- And see you later, RAW.
- Okay. Good-bye.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.335
- All right, good night.
- Buonanotte.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.649
You did well today.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.086
I will have you back
on Wednesday.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.436
You don't want me
back tomorrow?

22:30.479 --> 22:33.090
Tomorrow you'll meet with
Maxwell von Hausdorff.

22:33.134 --> 22:36.877
- Sounds German.
- Tragically so.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.879
Well, why
do you want me

22:38.922 --> 22:42.186
to meet with German
Maxwell von Hausdorff?

22:42.230 --> 22:47.104
Have a seat.
Don't worry, have a seat.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.588
So he's a renowned
art professor.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.111
I told him about
your work,

22:54.155 --> 22:56.331
and he's
agreed to meet you.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.464
Possibly give you
a trial in his class.

22:58.507 --> 22:59.552
A scholarship?

23:01.380 --> 23:04.687
Tuition costs $40,000
a year, sweetheart.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.560
Not a scholarship,
at least not yet.

23:07.603 --> 23:12.129
But if he likes your work,
you will be auditing his class.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.218
Audit his class?

23:14.262 --> 23:18.135
Dear me, boy,
you will take his class.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.921
But I don't have
enough money.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.619
You'll be
auditing the class!

23:25.534 --> 23:27.928
Which means you
will take it for free

23:27.971 --> 23:31.410
for the time being,
but you won't be enrolled.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.159
So you're the boy

23:42.203 --> 23:46.250
Maurizio's been
raving about.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.428
I believe you have
something for me.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.739
Ah, let's take
a look!

24:00.003 --> 24:02.441
Ah ah.

24:03.311 --> 24:09.448
Yeah. Oh.
Have you anything else?

24:13.234 --> 24:14.670
Uh...

24:16.019 --> 24:17.934
Uh-huh.

24:20.023 --> 24:23.984
Oh, now
this one interests me.

24:24.027 --> 24:28.292
- What is that?
- That, a cocktail napkin.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.686
Yeah, indeed,
but what is the work that

24:30.730 --> 24:34.560
- is on the cocktail napkin?
- Sweet Sienna.

24:34.603 --> 24:39.303
Oh, yeah.
Almost a found art quality.

24:39.347 --> 24:42.655
A touch of realism.
A genuine rare.

24:42.698 --> 24:45.005
Strong angles.

24:45.048 --> 24:49.792
Strokes reminiscent
of Victorian charcoal.

24:49.836 --> 24:55.232
Und how did you create
this red and yellow hues?

24:55.276 --> 24:57.496
Ketchup and mustard.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.595
Yeah, yeah.

25:09.638 --> 25:13.033
Very good, I think

25:13.076 --> 25:16.036
you can audit my class
if you wish.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.604
A special session has
already begun,

25:18.647 --> 25:23.260
but I believe I can
bring you up to speed.

25:23.304 --> 25:29.049
So right here,
Monday morning, 11:30 a.m.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.485
- Don't be late.
- Yeah.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.705
That should be
good, yeah.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.272
- Okay. Thank you. Thank-- okay.
- All right.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.492
- Yeah, yeah.
- The whole point of this

25:37.536 --> 25:40.147
game is we have
the stick in the hand, right?

25:40.190 --> 25:41.757
See how long
and hard, right?

25:41.801 --> 25:44.064
See these balls?
You want to hit the balls.

25:44.107 --> 25:45.631
- Hit all the balls there.
- Hi.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.284
Hey, brother,
what's going on, man?

25:47.328 --> 25:49.635
Can you step out
for a second?

25:49.678 --> 25:51.854
Whoa whoa whoa,
Randy, manners.

25:51.898 --> 25:55.162
Can you please
step out for a second?

25:55.205 --> 25:56.772
I'm gonna go
get a drink.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.861
- All right, hurry.
- Thank you.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.168
We need to work
on your game, kid.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.866
Yeah, I want to see Mom.

26:03.910 --> 26:07.740
Ma. What's wrong?

26:07.783 --> 26:09.872
Nothing's wrong,
I just want to tell her

26:09.916 --> 26:12.309
the good news,
and you need to take me.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.789
I can't
now, Randy.

26:13.833 --> 26:17.663
I mean, I got doubles
all month and, uh... you know.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.882
You're not working
right now, though, so.

26:19.926 --> 26:23.669
Yeah, but you can't show up
unannounced, kid, all right?

26:23.712 --> 26:27.324
What?

26:27.368 --> 26:28.891
'Cause Briarcliffe
has visiting hours.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.806
Look at me.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.330
You wanna go see her,
we'll go soon.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.594
- All right?
- You promise?

26:36.377 --> 26:42.122
Yeah, I promise.
So what's the good news?

26:42.165 --> 26:46.605
I'm going to the school,
and I took the job.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.826
Say that again.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.133
I took the job,
and I'm gonna be working

26:53.176 --> 26:54.917
with Mr. Gold
at ArtProv Gallery

26:54.961 --> 26:56.789
in Providence and I'm going

26:56.832 --> 26:58.704
to New England Tech
to audit the class.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.444
That's fantastic,
buddy, come here.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.620
Yes.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.709
Yes, yes, that's awesome.
Come here.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.712
All right, now you're taking
risks, and you're stepping out

27:06.755 --> 27:07.800
of your comfort zone.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.715
All right, like I always
taught you.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.151
- Yeah.
- That,

27:11.194 --> 27:12.935
that my friend,
takes cojones.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.155
Cojones?

27:15.198 --> 27:18.941
You know, your man cubes.
Your seed holders.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.857
- Your juice boxes.
- Juice box?

27:21.901 --> 27:23.467
Yeah, your prizes.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.861
You got the cash,
and you got the prizes. Yeah?

27:25.905 --> 27:27.820
- Uh... You have peanuts?
- Your walnuts, your peanuts.

27:27.863 --> 27:31.171
Do I have to spell it out?
Your balls, Randy, your balls.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.477
Look down.
Whoo, there we go!

27:33.521 --> 27:34.740
Now look
at me, don't-- okay?

27:34.783 --> 27:36.829
- I get it.
- Chip, one shot of Patrón

27:36.872 --> 27:38.831
- and one iced coffee.
- With no ice.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.181
- With no ice, bud.
- Your friend can come back.

27:41.224 --> 27:44.184
I'm so proud of you.
Come here, man.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.665
You know,
tomorrow...

27:47.013 --> 27:49.189
we're gonna have to buy
you some supplies.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.757
- You know, I--
- I already have my art supplies.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.410
The professor,
Maxwell von Hausdorff,

27:53.454 --> 27:55.848
- is German.
- See? Now, losing that job

27:55.891 --> 27:58.415
was the best thing that
could happen.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.503
I told you,
baby bro.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.418
We always...

28:02.245 --> 28:04.683
yo, we always
bounce back, right?

28:08.034 --> 28:09.426
It's your day.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.558
- Is it?
- Just for you.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.516
Hey, look
who's here.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.432
Sienna and her angry
trust fund baby boyfriend.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.912
Yo, watch this.

28:16.956 --> 28:19.219
What up, Beauty and the Beast?

28:19.262 --> 28:21.525
- Okay, yeah, get off.
- Okay, get off me.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.789
Is that what your pop
says about his coattails?

28:23.832 --> 28:25.225
You wanna talk
about this, trashman?

28:25.268 --> 28:26.792
Really? Relax,
bro, all right?

28:26.835 --> 28:28.445
Don't make a fool
of yourself

28:28.489 --> 28:30.230
in front of the lady
again, remember?

28:30.273 --> 28:33.537
You're stupid.
Let's just get out of here.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.801
I want to stay.
You said it was my night.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.455
It is your night.
Just somewhere else.

28:38.499 --> 28:41.894
- Okay, you're being a baby.
- I am not being a baby.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.244
Okay, well, I want
to stay with my friends.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.811
- Seriously?
- I stayed up all night

28:45.854 --> 28:48.248
trying to help you and now
you wanna leave? Go.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.685
I'm gonna stay here
with Randy and Harry.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.034
- Henry.
- Henry.

28:52.078 --> 28:56.038
I gotta take this.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.475
Ask her if you
can buy her a drink.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.260
- Randy.
- Can I buy you a drink?

29:00.303 --> 29:03.263
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.266
I want you
to meet Kourtney.

29:06.309 --> 29:07.963
- Yeah.

30:24.692 --> 30:31.003
Well, can I call you,
like, an Uber or a Lyft?

30:31.046 --> 30:32.569
No, no,
I'm gonna walk.

30:32.613 --> 30:33.919
I need to walk.

30:33.962 --> 30:35.355
I could use
the fresh air, actually.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.661
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:37.705 --> 30:43.842
Firm, very decisive.
I like. I like.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.583
I think I should walk.
I really should.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.368
I don't think you should be
walking anywhere.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.674
Yeah, I don't
think so either.

30:50.718 --> 30:54.374
- Or driving.
- Pretty much anything, yeah.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.941
I'll walk.

30:55.984 --> 31:01.163
I just had iced coffee
with no ice, so if you want.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.687
I'd like that.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.167
Okay, yeah,
hold on.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.082
I gotta--

31:09.650 --> 31:12.392
Here's my sweater,
so it's cold.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.046
I'm gonna go asleep.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.831
Thank you.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.051
- You gonna be okay?
- I'm fine.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.966
I'm fine.
I'm just gonna hangout.

31:21.009 --> 31:24.404
You guys go ahead
and... too-da-loo.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.406
Fly away.

31:26.449 --> 31:29.713
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah! Yeah, let's.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.977
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.109
I'll see you later.
Good. Have fun.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.067
- Yeah.
- All right.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.199
All right, bye.

31:37.243 --> 31:40.072
So Redlocks,
he became my brother

31:40.115 --> 31:41.725
when I was really little,

31:41.769 --> 31:45.207
and we kind of just
grew up together.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.427
So you're adopted?

31:47.470 --> 31:53.085
My real parents,
they abandoned me

31:53.128 --> 31:54.869
when I was five
in the lobby

31:54.913 --> 31:56.871
of Women
& Infants Hospital

31:56.915 --> 32:00.440
and then Redlocks
and my mom-- my real mom.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.050
I call her
my real mom.

32:02.094 --> 32:05.445
They brought me in
and raised me ever since that.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.448
- You're blessed.
- Hmm.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.754
Do you ever wonder
about your real parents?

32:10.798 --> 32:14.758
No, 'cause they left me,
and I barely knew them.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.456
So I have Redlocks

32:16.499 --> 32:18.675
who's my brother
and then my mom--

32:18.719 --> 32:20.677
my real mom
and I have a roof

32:20.721 --> 32:22.766
over my head
and my house

32:22.810 --> 32:25.030
and that's all
that really matters...

32:25.073 --> 32:28.250
- Right.
- ...are my roof, my mother...

32:28.294 --> 32:30.165
Yeah.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.256
I miss my home.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.911
Are you not happy here?

32:36.955 --> 32:40.784
I came from a small town
in Mexico when I was younger.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.787
My dad got a job here

32:43.831 --> 32:45.789
and ever since
we've been here,

32:45.833 --> 32:47.704
my parents
just tell me to find

32:47.748 --> 32:51.491
some rich
American boy to marry.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.798
That seems backwards.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.976
Yeah.
That's what I thought, too.

33:01.327 --> 33:04.069
Is Clinton
a rich American boy?

33:06.114 --> 33:08.943
Yeah. I guess
I'm just hoping

33:08.987 --> 33:11.511
that he's something
more than that.

33:11.554 --> 33:15.732
He's not very
nice to you, Sienna.

33:18.561 --> 33:19.998
No, he is.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.523
I wanna be
with somebody that

33:23.566 --> 33:28.528
wants to be with me
and doesn't need me.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.009
Yeah.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.752
So are you
a Patriots fan, Red Sox?

33:35.796 --> 33:37.754
I don't like sports.

33:37.798 --> 33:42.107
- What?
- Yeah, sports are dangerous.

33:42.150 --> 33:45.110
I thought every guy
likes sports.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.025
Not this guy.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.115
Have you been
to a game before?

33:50.158 --> 33:52.987
Redlocks, he says
I have no game.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.555
Well, you'll have to come

33:55.598 --> 33:58.210
to a game
with me sometime.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.343
Big crowds,
they make me nervous.

34:01.387 --> 34:05.565
I'll be there with you.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.784
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah.

34:11.831 --> 34:17.793
Hey, thanks for taking
this walk with me tonight.

34:17.838 --> 34:22.581
Yeah, can I have
your number

34:22.625 --> 34:25.367
so I can contact you
about the game?

34:25.411 --> 34:28.891
Well, Henry doesn't know

34:28.936 --> 34:30.155
what he's talking about

34:30.197 --> 34:33.071
because that's some game
you have there.

34:35.420 --> 34:39.293
- Is that me?
- Oh, it's a work in progress.

34:39.338 --> 34:45.300
Um... can I have
my pencil?

34:49.217 --> 34:52.306
Yeah, okay.
That's-- yeah.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.092
Thank you.

35:23.686 --> 35:26.080
Ah, Mr. Whitsey.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.431
Welcome.
Welcome.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.652
Mr. George,
please take position one.

35:32.695 --> 35:36.656
- Why?
- Mr. Whitsey, please take

35:36.699 --> 35:40.355
position three
next to Ms. Monroe.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.618
Go on, please.

35:46.927 --> 35:50.148
Hi, my name's Randy.

35:53.716 --> 35:58.982
Today, I will like you
to paint anything.

35:59.026 --> 36:03.161
- Anything at all.
- Like, anything?

36:04.031 --> 36:07.165
Yeah, anything.

36:08.035 --> 36:12.692
Today is about getting what's
in your mind onto the canvas.

36:12.735 --> 36:16.391
A clean mind
and a dirty canvas

36:16.435 --> 36:20.700
begins the process
of distilling our impurities.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.703
Today, you may
paint anything

36:23.746 --> 36:27.489
you'd like
in whatever style you like,

36:27.533 --> 36:31.363
but you may use
only one brush.

36:31.406 --> 36:35.367
Und you may begin now.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.196
What are you gonna paint?

36:40.981 --> 36:45.203
Anything.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.464
that can give it
its confidence.

37:29.508 --> 37:33.773
Und here we have
a near modern Miller-esque

37:33.816 --> 37:37.994
that lacks
the control and warmth

37:38.038 --> 37:42.999
and yet the--
there we are, the deco.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.088

37:45.132 --> 37:46.438

37:46.481 --> 37:49.789
This is mine.
You ruined it.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.486
- It's not--
- This is

37:51.530 --> 37:55.011
a studio workshop,
Mr. Whitsey.

37:55.055 --> 37:57.013
If I am
to instruct you--

37:57.057 --> 38:02.802
if I am to instruct them,
I will need to instruct.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.805
- Now--
- What about-- what about his?

38:05.848 --> 38:09.591
You touch my painting,
but his could be way better.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.507
- Go over there.
- Mr. Whit-- Mr. Whitsey.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.031
That was
rather rude.

38:15.075 --> 38:18.818
I'm sorry, it's not your fault.
Well, it is.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.385
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.604
In this setting,
this is our work.

38:22.648 --> 38:27.130
It is for everyone
to gain experience und for me

38:27.174 --> 38:29.045
to share
my knowledge.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.787
Now, as
I was saying--

38:32.658 --> 38:34.834
Okay.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.402
This should prove interesting.

38:37.445 --> 38:43.538
Uh, maybe for next time.

Have a scuffle
with the little lady?

good artist, baby bro.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.704
That's what I call
my older brother, Redlocks.

41:29.748 --> 41:35.318
- Yeah? Is he a pirate?
- No, he's a garbageman.

41:35.362 --> 41:38.017
Well, Redlocks
the Garbageman is very wise.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.237
You should listen to him.
Artists are replaceable.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.588
People are not replaceable.

I have chosen?

No, I like.

Does his form
not interest you?

44:08.646 --> 44:12.650
I'm not
a homosexual.

44:12.911 --> 44:16.828
That was not the intention
of my question.

44:16.871 --> 44:20.962
Is there a reason
you have chosen to paint this?

44:21.006 --> 44:23.835
There's nothing wrong
with your model.

44:23.878 --> 44:25.967
He's very well-defined,
and I can see why

44:26.011 --> 44:30.493
you chose him
but his body will--

44:30.537 --> 44:32.495
it will
effectuate realism,

44:32.539 --> 44:34.976
so it's
a good choice.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.196
Very good.

44:37.239 --> 44:42.505
Then why does
your painting have breasts?

44:42.549 --> 44:45.683
- It's what he inspired.
- Hmm.

44:53.038 --> 44:55.127
- Later.
- Mm.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.216
- What you doing now?
- Getting ready to go

44:57.259 --> 45:00.872
- do some errands.
- Mind if I tag along?

45:00.915 --> 45:02.656
We can grab
a coffee after.

45:02.700 --> 45:06.007
I like iced coffee
only, so.

45:06.051 --> 45:10.795
- Sounds good.
- But with no ice.

45:10.838 --> 45:13.711
- Okay, no ice.
- No ice.

45:19.847 --> 45:22.676
This tent that had all this
local artists and stuff

45:22.720 --> 45:25.810
in there,
and I fell in love

45:25.853 --> 45:28.813
with a painting
of a cactus.

45:28.856 --> 45:32.033
And I knew I wanted to be
an artist since I was eight.

45:32.077 --> 45:35.558
I remember eight well.
Great year.

45:35.602 --> 45:37.952
Nobody remembers
all of eight.

45:38.997 --> 45:42.957
I do.
But I'm not like most people.

45:46.308 --> 45:50.573
- To new friends.
- Are we friends?

45:50.617 --> 45:53.751
Yeah! I think so.

45:56.971 --> 46:02.368
So the girl that you paint
in class, do you know her?

46:02.411 --> 46:06.502
- Yeah.
- So she's your girlfriend.

46:06.546 --> 46:08.287
No.

46:08.330 --> 46:11.594
But you want her
to be.

46:11.638 --> 46:13.945
I never had one.

46:13.988 --> 46:18.253
- Do you have her number?
- Yeah, she gave it to me.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.953
That means she's interested.
Have you called her?

46:21.996 --> 46:25.521
- No.
- Why not?

46:25.565 --> 46:29.003
I'm afraid if I call,
she won't pick up.

46:30.352 --> 46:33.007
Then you leave a message.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.799
You should call her.

46:43.365 --> 46:46.804
Only
if you really want to.

47:03.037 --> 47:05.823
Right then, perfect timing.

47:10.392 --> 47:13.047
Hey, buddy.

47:18.705 --> 47:21.055
Oh, hey, Redlocks,
how was your day?

47:21.099 --> 47:23.928
Mine was good.
Thanks for asking. Yeah.

47:41.641 --> 47:43.948
Hi, Sienna, how are you?

47:43.991 --> 47:45.819
I'm doing well.
How are you?

47:45.863 --> 47:49.040
I think I'm ready to go
to the sports game with you.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.693
Oh, great.

47:50.737 --> 47:52.608
Great, what are you
doing tomorrow?

47:52.652 --> 47:53.958

are playing at McCoy.

47:54.001 --> 47:55.960
I have--
I have class tomorrow.

47:56.003 --> 48:01.182
- Oh, what about the next day?
- I have class then as well.

48:01.226 --> 48:03.402
Well, then
that makes it difficult.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.621
I will-- I'll skip class
for you.

48:05.665 --> 48:06.971
No, don't do that.

48:07.014 --> 48:08.842
Don't do that.
That's not a good idea.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.976
It's fine, I'm better
than that class, anyway.

48:12.019 --> 48:17.198
- Oh. Well, wow, okay.
- I wanna bring Redlocks.

48:17.242 --> 48:19.418
Yeah, yeah, that's a--
that's a great idea.

48:19.461 --> 48:20.898
I'll bring Clinton.

48:21.246 --> 48:24.640
- Yeah, okay, sure, yeah.
- Okay.

That-- I'll leave
two tickets

48:26.033 --> 48:29.645
- at will call for you.
- Okay.

48:29.689 --> 48:31.909
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow, then.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.869
Okay, we're gonna go
to a baseball game

48:35.913 --> 48:38.437
with Sienna and her
angry boyfriend tomorrow.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.874
- Oh, we are?
- She said she will call

48:40.918 --> 48:43.659
about two tickets tomorrow.

48:43.703 --> 48:45.661
Are you sure
that's what she said, Randy?

48:45.705 --> 48:48.664
Yes, she said she will call
about two tickets tomorrow.

48:48.708 --> 48:50.101
Pretty sure I know
what she meant.

48:50.144 --> 48:51.363
- Hey, hey.
- Huh?

48:51.406 --> 48:53.017
I really don't
like her boyfriend.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.759
Oh, yeah, I don't--
yeah, I don't--

48:56.803 --> 48:59.110
Attaboy. I'll see you
later, buddy.

48:59.153 --> 49:01.155
- Don't slam the door.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.945
Hey, come on.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.691
- It's gonna be loud.
- Hey, I got you.

49:15.735 --> 49:18.129
- All right, let's go.
- Uh...

49:18.172 --> 49:19.913
Jesus, Randy,
come on.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.697
You're gonna have
a good time, all right?

49:21.741 --> 49:23.047
I got you.
Let's go.

49:23.090 --> 49:25.049
- You need to lock--
- I locked the door.

49:25.092 --> 49:27.486
- Don't worry about it. Come on.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.387
It's nice being around
good people.

51:26.431 --> 51:29.173
- Yeah.
- I really liked the hot dogs.

51:29.216 --> 51:30.609
- They were good.
- Thanks so much.

51:30.652 --> 51:34.830
- Yeah.
- Let's go, baby bro.

51:34.874 --> 51:38.312
- Bye, Randy.
- Okay.

51:38.356 --> 51:40.097
Bye.

51:44.971 --> 51:48.061
- What the hell was that?
- What was what?

51:48.105 --> 51:50.411
"What was what?"
You just kissed a taken woman.

51:50.455 --> 51:52.935
Taken?
I don't follow.

51:52.979 --> 51:54.850
You can't just
kiss someone, Randy.

51:54.894 --> 51:56.417
I mean, he's mean to her.

51:56.461 --> 51:57.853
Right, okay.

51:57.897 --> 52:00.639
And then
I'm nice to her, so...

52:00.682 --> 52:03.294
A kiss, you know,
it should be mutual.

52:03.337 --> 52:05.644
Well, she kissed me back.

52:05.687 --> 52:07.298
I mean, I didn't feel
her tongue.

52:07.341 --> 52:08.864
Did I do it wrong?

52:08.908 --> 52:10.649
You crash-landed
on your face, all right?

52:10.692 --> 52:13.304
Come on, let's get out of here
before the American psycho

52:13.347 --> 52:16.089
- wakes up and finds his ax.
- Oh!

52:16.133 --> 52:17.438
- It's un-- it's unlocked.
- Yeah.

52:17.482 --> 52:19.962
I know-- I know,
I unlocked the car.

52:20.006 --> 52:21.660
- But you said you locked it.
- I didn't.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.358
- On the way in--
- Shut up. Put your seatbelt on.

52:24.402 --> 52:25.881
All right.

52:25.925 --> 52:28.145
- Okay, let's go, then.
- Oh, God.

52:32.018 --> 52:35.326
- Randy!
- Oh, hey, Cassie. How are you?

52:35.369 --> 52:36.892
Hi, I'm good.

52:36.936 --> 52:39.678
- We should go so we're not late.
- Good.

52:39.721 --> 52:41.897
Aah!

52:41.941 --> 52:45.379
Sorry.

52:45.423 --> 52:48.339
- Thanks.
- Mr. Whitsey...

52:48.382 --> 52:52.343
about the girl
from your paintings.

52:52.386 --> 52:55.172
Ahem.

52:56.390 --> 52:59.263
I realize she's
a preferred subject,

52:59.306 --> 53:01.395
but it's very
important that you work

53:01.439 --> 53:03.702
on what
I present in class.

53:03.745 --> 53:08.272
I cannot teach you if you're
not following my lessons.

53:08.315 --> 53:10.926
I don't like
your lessons, it's...

53:10.970 --> 53:12.711
Fair enough.

53:12.754 --> 53:14.495
But this is
a very special class

53:14.539 --> 53:16.715
that NEIT is offering.

53:16.758 --> 53:18.717
Something unique.

53:18.760 --> 53:22.286
And you constantly
defying my syllabus,

53:22.329 --> 53:25.027
it's not just
a problem for me.

53:25.071 --> 53:28.205
It's also a problem
for the other students as well.

53:28.770 --> 53:30.511
It's a distraction.

53:30.555 --> 53:32.948
I don't want
to be a distraction.

53:32.992 --> 53:37.388
Yeah, I know you don't.
But they are distracted.

53:37.431 --> 53:39.041
May I go to class now?

53:39.085 --> 53:43.307
- I don't--
- Where were you yesterday?

53:43.350 --> 53:45.396
I was at a baseball game.

53:45.439 --> 53:50.183
Baseball? So you think baseball
is more important than art?

53:50.227 --> 53:52.403
Of course not,
but I was with Red--

53:52.446 --> 53:55.057
I don't care
who you were with.

53:55.101 --> 53:56.537
If you miss one more class,

53:56.581 --> 53:59.758
your time here
is done. Verstehe?

53:59.801 --> 54:02.456
Get, get, get!

54:11.117 --> 54:14.207
- Buonasera, Randall.
- Mr. Gold.

54:14.251 --> 54:16.340
Come with me.

54:16.383 --> 54:18.429
Have you heard of the artist
Mauricio Callegari?

54:18.472 --> 54:20.779
Painted
Il Trágico, 1879.

54:20.822 --> 54:23.434
Molto bene.
And only Il Trágico.

54:23.477 --> 54:24.783
Do you know why?

54:24.826 --> 54:27.089
- No.
- Because he was caught

54:27.133 --> 54:29.222
sleeping with
his patron's wife.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.790
His patron
then cut his penis off

54:31.833 --> 54:34.009
and slipped the knife
into his belly

54:34.053 --> 54:37.274
and spilled his entrails
all over the piazza.

54:38.275 --> 54:42.104
The point being is
many men's downfall

54:42.148 --> 54:44.106
has been
a woman of lust.

54:44.150 --> 54:45.369
I don't understand.

54:45.412 --> 54:48.589
I hope you never do.

It's really beautiful

55:37.203 --> 55:39.336

Who hates who?

56:08.147 --> 56:09.888
My sweet Sienna,
they hate her.

56:09.931 --> 56:13.848
- They're jealous of us.
- You lost me.

56:15.372 --> 56:18.113
Never mind, okay?

56:18.157 --> 56:19.550
All right, look,
whoever Sweet Sienna is,

56:19.593 --> 56:21.334
however sweet
she may be,

56:21.378 --> 56:23.467
she seems to be
clouding your judgment.

56:23.510 --> 56:26.383
How would you know?

56:27.166 --> 56:28.907
I heard Maurizio
and Hausdorff talking,

56:28.950 --> 56:31.562
and they said you're fixated
on some subject.

56:31.605 --> 56:34.608
All right,
and it's affecting your work.

56:41.267 --> 56:42.921
Yeah, we'll be talking.

56:42.964 --> 56:44.923
You think it's wrong
I paint Sweet Sienna

56:44.966 --> 56:47.142
in the German's class?

56:47.186 --> 56:49.623
She has a name
and an adjective.

56:49.667 --> 56:51.625
How appalling.

56:52.191 --> 56:54.628
Look, I never met the girl,

56:54.672 --> 56:57.239
but it's clear that she has
a spell on you.

56:57.283 --> 56:59.154
One that
you're unable to control.

56:59.198 --> 57:00.504
It's all
the German's fault.

57:00.547 --> 57:02.244
I doubt that.

57:02.288 --> 57:04.943
But he does not like that
you won't paint what he asks.

57:04.986 --> 57:09.164
- He says that all the time.
- Well, I suggest you listen.

57:09.208 --> 57:11.645
When are you
gonna give me my own show?

57:11.689 --> 57:13.255
Excuse me, Randall,

57:13.299 --> 57:14.518
but your insolent tone
is off-putting.

57:14.561 --> 57:16.737
When are you gonna give me
my own show?

57:16.781 --> 57:19.653
When you show
some respect.

57:19.697 --> 57:21.525
When your art is up to par

57:21.568 --> 57:23.962
and worthy of being displayed
at the ArtProv Gallery.

57:24.005 --> 57:25.964
My galleria!

57:26.007 --> 57:28.532
When you appreciate
the opportunities

57:28.575 --> 57:31.186
presented to you.

57:33.232 --> 57:35.974
I think you should go
back to work now.

57:36.017 --> 57:41.196
We'll discuss the show
when I'm ready. Go!

57:42.720 --> 57:45.200
- Autism?
- I think so.

57:45.244 --> 57:47.986
High-functioning.
It all makes sense.

57:48.029 --> 57:49.553
He has amazing talent,

57:49.596 --> 57:51.990
but he seems to be unaware
of his condition.

57:52.033 --> 57:53.557
If you cut him off,

57:53.600 --> 57:56.211
he'll never be able
to realize what he can do.

57:56.255 --> 57:58.997
I will allow him to continue,

57:59.040 --> 58:01.782
provided he stops
painting that girl.

58:01.826 --> 58:07.309
- I don't know if the girl--
- You think that I'm retarded?

58:07.353 --> 58:08.789
That I'm not capable
of painting anything

58:08.833 --> 58:10.661
other than
a single subject?

58:10.704 --> 58:12.576
Of course not,
but you bursting into my office

58:12.619 --> 58:14.447
like this does not
help your case.

58:14.491 --> 58:17.581
I am not
mentally retarded.

58:17.624 --> 58:20.584
- Randy--
- One day I will be

58:20.627 --> 58:25.240
a brilliant artist
and you will respect me.

58:25.284 --> 58:30.811
If I wanna paint Sienna
every day of the week I will,

58:30.855 --> 58:34.598
whether you
hate her or not.

58:34.641 --> 58:36.687
- Randy--
- No!

58:36.730 --> 58:38.515
No!

58:49.526 --> 58:51.528
You kissed
my girl!

58:53.530 --> 58:56.620
You think you can do

58:56.663 --> 58:58.273
whatever you want
because you're special?

58:58.317 --> 59:01.538
Stop!

59:01.886 --> 59:04.845
- Stop, Clinton! Stop, stop!
- Come on, fight back.

59:04.889 --> 59:08.066
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on, fight back.

59:08.109 --> 59:10.547
Clinton, stop!
Clinton, stop!

59:23.560 --> 59:26.040
She's all I have, Randy.

59:36.703 --> 59:40.098
I couldn't
find my bike.

59:40.141 --> 59:42.100
What happened?

59:42.143 --> 59:43.667
Well, apparently
you got

59:43.710 --> 59:45.799
a good old-fashioned
ass-kicking.

59:45.843 --> 59:49.324
- Did I fight back at least?
- That's not important.

59:49.368 --> 59:51.413
It is.
It's very important.

59:51.457 --> 59:55.417
What matters is that
you're okay now.

59:55.461 --> 59:57.594
Thank you,
Mr. Gold.

59:58.464 --> 01:00:01.119
You are
an outstanding artist, Randy.

01:00:01.162 --> 01:00:04.557
You have amazing raw talent.
Pun intended.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.690
But you're lacking
the critical understanding

01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:09.127
of the art form.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.348
You're also lacking control
of your emotions.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.437
What makes great art

01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:21.139
is this in tandem
with this.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:24.359
Heart and head
in harmony.

01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:25.709
Your emotions
and your mind,

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:29.843
they don't work together
like most people.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:35.632
I must ask.
Do you have autism?

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:41.159
When I was--
when I was three years old,

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:47.165
I was diagnosed with
Asperger syndrome but in 2013,

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:50.821
the DSM-5, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual

01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:53.388
of Mental Disorders,
Edition 5

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.173
has defined it
and other forms

01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:58.176
of autism inclusively
as this is one thing.

01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:02.180
It's autism spectrum disorder.
It's all one thing.

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:05.183
It's not-- yeah.
It's just one, yeah.

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:06.750
- It's not a--
- It's okay.

01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:12.407
It's okay.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.414
Don't be sorry.
Autism, it's what I have.

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:25.899
It's not who I am.
I'm just-- I'm just Randy.

01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:31.209
Randy. I will give you
a hug right now,

01:01:31.252 --> 01:01:34.212
but I suppose that
will make you uncomfortable.

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:37.519
- You can do it for two seconds.
- Cool.

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:41.698
- Two seconds, okay.
- Well, three but only three.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.701
Three it is.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.922
One, two...

01:01:58.279 --> 01:02:00.717
Clinton told me what happened.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:04.459
I'm sorry
that he hurt you.

01:02:04.503 --> 01:02:06.723
How is he?

01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:10.248
He's all right,
I guess.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:14.252
He's hurt
on the inside, too.

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:17.821
I mean,
I feel bad for him.

01:02:17.864 --> 01:02:19.474
You're so sweet.

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:25.263
No, you're sweet, Sienna.
I really think so.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:28.745
Thank you, Randy.

01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:35.752
Do you wanna see
something in my studio?

01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:39.494
Sure, yeah.

01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:44.935
Are these me?

01:02:44.978 --> 01:02:48.765
Yeah, you inspire
my feelings.

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.072
How do I do that?

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:55.597
I don't know, you just--
you just kind of do.

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.077
You're a really
strong person,

01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.776
and I wanna be
as strong as you.

01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:07.087
Can you sit on that stool
so I can paint?

01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:08.610
- Sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03:08.654 --> 01:03:11.744
Yeah,
on the stool.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:17.010
Okay. Cool.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:20.622
What do you
want me to do?

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:22.537
Look natural.

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:25.889
Well, it's not
really natural

01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:29.327
for me to just
randomly pose for you.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:33.766
Okay. All right,
listen to this.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.900
I got music and stuff--
it's what I do.

01:03:36.943 --> 01:03:40.642
- It's...
- What song should I listen to?

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.819
I'll get that.

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.996
Okay, yeah.

01:03:46.039 --> 01:03:48.041
Yeah,
it's a good one.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.564
Put them-- yeah.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.653
Just put them

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.134
Sienna.

01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:23.876
Yeah.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.923
Wow. Okay.

FAST SIGNS
PET ADOPTION FAIR

01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.460
I don't want another dog.

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:44.679
Dogs die.

01:05:44.723 --> 01:05:49.032
It ain't just a dog.
It's a-- hey, look at it.

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:50.903
It's a companion, right?

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.036
I have other things
on my mind, okay?

01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:54.167
Yeah, you mean somebody.

01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:55.777
Don't say it
like that.

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:58.171
- Don't say it like what?
- Like you're mad at her.

01:05:58.215 --> 01:06:00.130
You're upset 'cause
you had sex with her,

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:02.045
and she rejected you.

01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:04.134
- Did you wear a condom?
- Look, she didn't reject me.

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:06.484
And we didn't
have sex, all right?

01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:09.966
Well, what about you?
When are you gonna see Mom?

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:12.055
Don't change
the subject, all right?

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:13.795
She's dying.

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:16.146
And you pretend like she's on
some kind of big vacation.

01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:18.061
Hey, this ain't
about me, all right?

01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:20.150
No, it's about me!
It's always been about me!

01:06:20.193 --> 01:06:23.066
Why am I the only one
that's supposed to change?

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:26.156
You say you want more and when
you get a free moment,

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:28.071
you're out drinking it
away in a bar.

01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:30.073
- Hey, that is enough!
- It's not enough!

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:31.422
It's never enough!

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:33.815
I'm sick and tired of being
told what's good for me.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:36.079
- I know what's good for me.
- Look at me.

01:06:36.122 --> 01:06:38.733
You're about to make
a fool of yourself right now.

01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:42.999
- Calm--
- I know me. I know me.

01:06:43.347 --> 01:06:45.175
What's his name?

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.526
Harlan. But you know something,
if you want this dog,

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:50.832
you can call him
whatever you want.

01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:53.009
No, his name's
Harlan.

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:58.536
Redlocks,
meet Harlan.

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.842
Hey, beautiful. Come here.

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:03.976
You think you can give
this dog a loving home?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.325
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:07.240
Can we keep him?

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:11.505

ALL NATURAL PET FOODS

01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:22.038
Yo, Randy?

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:27.260
Yo, buddy, get up.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.047
Hurry up.

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:38.054
Are you feeling
stressed, Randy?

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.015
Very stressed.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.886
I don't know how
she feels about me.

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.584
I see.

01:07:46.627 --> 01:07:49.804
This is
not good.

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:52.590
Swelling in your face,
hands, mouth, and throat.

01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:54.157
Chest tightness,
trouble breathing,

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.897
fast flow, pounding,
or uneven heartbeat.

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:58.378
Fever, sweating, confusion,
or muscle stiffness.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:07:59.901
Increased hunger
or thirst.

01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:01.294
Change in how often
you urinate.

01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:03.383
Lightheadedness,
dizziness, or fainting.

01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:05.603
Numbness or weakness
on one side of your body.

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.170
Sudden or severe
headache problems

01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:08.823
with vision,
speech, or walking.

01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:12.914
Painful or prolonged erections.
Seizures or tremors.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.394
Breast soreness
and nipple discharge

01:08:14.438 --> 01:08:16.917
in both women
and men.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:20.313
And trouble swallowing, too.
Yeah, I can't take this.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:23.577
I just...

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:41.117
TAKE 1 TABLET
EVERY TO 8 HOURS

01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:32.167
I have something
that should raise your spirit.

01:09:33.952 --> 01:09:35.345
I'm hosting a showcase

01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:37.694
of several artists
and photographers,

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:41.481
and I'd like
to offer you a spot.

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:44.180
One piece.
Your best work.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.357
Really? You want
to show my work?

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:50.273
One piece.
Make it great.

01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:52.188
Make it RAW. Salute.

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:56.409
You can drink.

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:25.046
Randy!
Congratulations.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.396
Oh, what for?

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:28.963
The show.
Professor told me.

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:31.183
- Yeah.
- I'm really excited for you.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.751
Yeah, cool, I'm excited.
It's gonna be cool.

01:10:33.794 --> 01:10:35.318
Are you creating
a new piece,

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:36.971
or are you using
an existing one?

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:40.758
Mr. Gold wants me
to make a new one specifically

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:43.761
for this show,
so I think I'm just gonna...

01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:45.415
- Cool.
- ...like, do...

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:49.070
- Well, what's the concept?
- I don't know, um...

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.333
I don't know yet.

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:51.986
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:53.988
Isn't the show
kind of soon?

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:59.080
Yeah, I should probably
get with that.

01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:01.779
I have to-- yes.
I'm gonna do it.

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.488
Sienna?

01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:22.495
Look, you're
stronger than me.

01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.454
You always have been.

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:26.456
When you really let somebody in,
that's when you'll be happy.

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.762
It's not that easy.

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:33.506
Just give me
a chance, please.

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:38.032
What is it, Randy?

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:46.040
Is everything okay at home?

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:49.261
What does that have to do
with the painting?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.307
More than
you might know.

01:11:54.179 --> 01:12:00.620
I feel, um...
broken, Redlocks.

01:12:00.664 --> 01:12:03.623
- Broken how?
- I feel numb.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:06.409
I feel like the medication

01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:09.629
is, like, is taking
my feelings away,

01:12:09.673 --> 01:12:12.632
and I'm not--
I'm not inspired

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:15.548
and I have
nothing to paint.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.856
Well, look, buddy, it's only
meant to be temporary.

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:22.555
I think I wanna stop
taking the medication.

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:25.863
The pharmacist says you can't
just, you know, stop.

01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:28.518
I know, I wanna stop
as soon as possible.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:33.653
Look, uh... let's just give it
a little time, all right?

01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:36.090
Let your body adjust.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:42.575
Do you think
Sienna likes me?

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:55.849
Look, buddy, she definitely
likes you, all right?

01:12:57.155 --> 01:13:03.379
But maybe not in the same way
that you like her.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.338
How do you mean?

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.688
Hey, we promised to always be
honest with each other, right?

01:13:08.732 --> 01:13:10.342
- Yes.
- Right?

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.605
- Always honest.
- Yeah, to a fault.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.695
All right, buddy, look.

01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:21.701
She's...
out of your league.

01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:23.703
Now, hold on, some women can

01:13:23.747 --> 01:13:27.577
be very,
very superficial, right?

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.581
Now, they base attraction off
a lot of unrealistic qualities

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:36.412
and, uh...
and attributes in guys.

01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:39.502
But you can love somebody,

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:42.243
you know, without it
being physical.

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:44.942
Kind of like
loving someone from afar.

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:51.427
Just like
you love Mom from afar?

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.951
Was that an insult, Randy?

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.735
- Are you insulted?
- Yes.

01:13:55.779 --> 01:14:00.436
Then yes, it's an insult.

01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:03.656
Now, Randy, I, uh...

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:09.445
I really sacrificed.

01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:14.406
I put any kind of dream

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:19.455
I had on damn hold
for you!

01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:25.199
For you.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:30.944
- I didn't ask you to.
- I know.

01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:37.473
I know.
I did it 'cause I love you.

01:14:57.623 --> 01:14:59.799
Not quite
what I had in mind.

01:14:59.843 --> 01:15:01.714
Is there anything else
you've done?

01:15:01.758 --> 01:15:05.588
No, that's
my submission.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:07.590
Are you
absolutely sure?

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:10.244
That's it.
That's the one I want, okay?

01:15:10.288 --> 01:15:12.595
Just use that,
please.

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:18.252
You know who Sweet Sienna is.
Prepare this.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:22.735
I think you have more potential
than you're realizing.

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:24.476
Consider submitting
something else, yes?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.695
I don't
wanna consider anything.

01:15:25.738 --> 01:15:28.828
I want you to put her up
on that wall now, okay?

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.747
Sweet Sienna Hey, Randy.
Omw to your place. R U home?

01:15:39.099 --> 01:15:42.538
I gotta go.
Thanks. Oh, shit.

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.546
Look, Randy...

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.766
I know how
you feel about me.

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:56.639
When you kissed me out
in the parking lot

01:15:56.682 --> 01:16:00.512
after the game, I could tell
how much it meant to you.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:04.516
And I want you to know
that it felt good for me, too.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.388
Well, that's good,
right?

01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:11.567
- Yeah, it is.
- Good.

01:16:14.918 --> 01:16:17.573
Look, it's not
easy for me.

01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:24.884
I know feelings, they can be--
feelings can be hard.

01:16:24.928 --> 01:16:29.323
But there's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:32.413
No. No,
please don't.

01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:33.893
- Don't.
- Just stay right here.

01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:36.113
I have
to go, Randy.

01:16:36.156 --> 01:16:41.074
Please, please.
This-- you gotta stay.

01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.603
Look, Randy...

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:52.608
Randy.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.834
I don't want
to hurt you.

01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:07.361
- All right.
- You're one of the sweetest,

01:17:07.405 --> 01:17:12.845
most honest, and the most
real person I ever met.

01:17:14.194 --> 01:17:16.370
Thank you.

01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:26.642
Look... I'm going through
something right now.

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:30.820
I don't even know
what it is yet.

01:17:30.863 --> 01:17:34.650
I need to clear my head
and figure some things out.

01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:38.654
And when I do--
look at me.

01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:43.833
I want us
to be friends, Randy.

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:46.879
There's nothing
that I want more than that.

01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:50.666
Do you understand what
I mean by friends?

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:59.675
Yeah. Yeah, friends,
like a school-- school friends.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.377
- I know. Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:10.773
You're
my sweet Sienna.

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:13.689
Please don't make this harder
than it already is.

01:18:16.256 --> 01:18:20.696
- I have to go.
- But I-- but I love you.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:26.440
Sienna, I love you.

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:31.924
You're supposed to say it back.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:42.021
You're supposed
to say it back!

01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:43.936
Sienna!

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.725

He isn't here.

My painting is supposed
to be hanging right there,

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.158
and it's not now.

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:01.160
And I want
to know why.

01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:04.816
Well, Maurizio didn't feel like
it was your best work.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.386
- Who's he to judge?
- It's his gallery.

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:11.040
I think
he's a liar.

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.390
He said my painting
was gonna be right there,

01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:15.174
and then
he took it away.

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:16.828
Well, he didn't
take it away.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.875
He's just putting up
one of mine instead.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.400
He's gonna hang
one of your paintings?

01:21:23.443 --> 01:21:25.054
Oh, God, no.

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:26.707
No, that would be
a train wreck.

01:21:26.751 --> 01:21:29.188
He's putting up
one of my photos.

01:21:29.232 --> 01:21:31.712
Why are you
telling me this?

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:34.628
I'm just being honest
with you, man.

01:21:34.672 --> 01:21:37.631
I mean, look, it's not like
you don't have skills.

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:38.981
I guess you do.

01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:41.418
It's just that this wasn't
your best work.

01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:44.725
Maurizio only wants to hang
the best in his exhibits.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:48.425
This is why he's putting up
one of my pieces.

01:21:48.468 --> 01:21:49.992
I think
you're a liar, too.

01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:53.212
I think you wanted your piece
in the show so bad

01:21:53.256 --> 01:21:56.912
that you told him
that my art wasn't any good.

01:21:57.477 --> 01:22:02.004
You'll never be
the artist that I am.

01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:05.050
I freaking
hate you, Butch.

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.663
Are we done?

01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:18.237
Sienna, she didn't
say it back.

01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:20.457
Mr. Gold and Butch
are liars.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.938
Everybody hates me.

01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:31.163

Cassie? What
are you doing here?

01:24:04.387 --> 01:24:08.217
- What?
- What are you doing here?

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.219
I told you,
this is my spot.

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:12.003
Where I come
to clear my head.

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.006
Oh. Yeah,
I remember.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.227
I didn't realize
I walked this far.

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.011
Where are you
going to?

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.230
I don't know.

01:24:21.273 --> 01:24:24.059
- What?
- I don't know.

01:24:26.191 --> 01:24:28.237
Is everything
okay?

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.022
Just having
a really bad day.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:35.287
- What?
- Just having a really bad day.

01:24:39.944 --> 01:24:41.815
Hold on.

01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:49.258
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:53.827
Can I join you?
Okay.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.318
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:09.626
Do you think
that something good

01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:12.107
can come
from something bad?

01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:15.632
You mean like
a blessing in disguise?

01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:18.113
I don't do well
with most metaphors.

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:22.943
We all have to let go
of expectations in order

01:25:22.987 --> 01:25:25.120
to see things
as they are.

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:30.212
I've never felt
this way before.

01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:33.128
It hurts on the inside.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.871
Before art school,

01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:42.963
I had this really
stupid and lousy job.

01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:47.968
I had money,
but I was miserable.

01:25:48.012 --> 01:25:51.972
I'm broke now,
but I'm happier

01:25:52.016 --> 01:25:54.366
doing something
that's important to me.

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:57.152
What does that
have to do with love?

01:25:58.022 --> 01:26:00.372
Everything.

01:26:00.416 --> 01:26:02.679
I had to let go
of something that wasn't

01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:04.463
making me
feel good anymore

01:26:04.507 --> 01:26:06.900
so I could allow
an opportunity

01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:09.251
for something better
to blossom.

01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:12.993
You know, something good
from something bad.

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:16.171
What if I'm not able
to let it go?

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:22.394
What inspires you,
Randy?

01:26:24.396 --> 01:26:27.269
Feelings, emotions.

01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:31.403
I just paint so I can express
what's hard to say.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.935
You wanna know
what I'm feeling?

01:26:43.067 --> 01:26:46.375
- Yes.
- I'm thinking how lucky

01:26:46.418 --> 01:26:50.379
anyone would be
to know you.

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:52.381
Whether you
realize it or not,

01:26:52.424 --> 01:26:53.947
you have
showed me that

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:59.301
it's okay to be myself.
Unapologetically.

01:26:59.344 --> 01:27:01.955
I think
you're great.

01:27:01.999 --> 01:27:07.047
And I think you are exactly
the way you need to be, Randy.

01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:10.442
Come.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.970
