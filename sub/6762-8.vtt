01:39.670 --> 01:41.709
Keep it, buddy.

01:51.974 --> 01:53.136
Brandon.

01:57.396 --> 01:58.938
Brandon.

02:01.942 --> 02:03.056
Brandon.

02:05.529 --> 02:06.727
Get out of bed, pokey.

02:06.905 --> 02:09.740
You don't wanna be late
for school, do you?

02:09.907 --> 02:12.992
l can't believe that summer's over.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.408
l was having the best dream.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.738
You won't believe
the nightmare l had last night.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.125
Let me guess.

02:20.293 --> 02:22.499
You showed up at school naked.

02:23.046 --> 02:24.955
- How did you know?
- lt was either that

02:25.131 --> 02:28.464
or the one where you have to take
an exam you haven't studied for.

02:28.634 --> 02:30.756
l had that one the night before.

02:31.429 --> 02:33.551
Anxiety dreams, Bren.

02:33.889 --> 02:35.466
What's there for me
to be anxious about?

02:35.641 --> 02:38.131
l mean, it's not like we're the new kids
on the block anymore.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.267
The first day of school.

02:40.438 --> 02:44.767
New classes, new teachers,
old boyfriends...

02:44.942 --> 02:49.069
What does that have to do
with going to school naked?

02:49.738 --> 02:52.193
Right. Relax.

02:52.366 --> 02:55.781
You were probably just trying
to make a fashion statement.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.978
Remember last year
we drove up here for the first time,

04:11.151 --> 04:12.349
saw all these hot cars?

04:12.527 --> 04:17.023
Yeah, l hate to speak ill of the dead,
but Mondale just did not quite cut it.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.625
- Hey, Steve. Nice shirt.
- This old thing?

04:31.671 --> 04:34.161
Hey, guys.
Are we all ready to buckle down?

04:34.340 --> 04:36.498
God, l don't know
if l can take another year of this.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.253
Seems like
the summer flew by so fast.

04:38.427 --> 04:39.458
Don't they all?

04:39.637 --> 04:42.887
Well, Kel, last year at this time,
we were barely on speaking terms.

04:43.057 --> 04:46.223
- The good old days.
- l've got a stomach ache.

04:46.394 --> 04:48.600
l always get a stomach ache
on the first day of school.

04:48.771 --> 04:51.012
Oh, l never do.
l puke the night before.

04:57.863 --> 05:01.907
Well, this is it, guys.
Back to the big house.

05:02.076 --> 05:05.694
Open up those cell doors wide.
Here we come.

05:08.957 --> 05:10.415
And don't forget, everybody.

05:10.626 --> 05:11.870
Thursday is Hello Day.

05:12.044 --> 05:14.166
The unofficial start
of the new school year.

05:14.337 --> 05:17.207
So have your songs and skits ready.

05:17.382 --> 05:19.588
Winners get their names
inscribed forever

05:19.759 --> 05:22.962
on the West Beverly Wall of Shame.

05:29.644 --> 05:32.977
- l wish l was addicted to love.
- Donna, be careful what you wish for.

05:33.147 --> 05:35.435
Yeah, well,
l'm getting a boyfriend this year.

05:35.608 --> 05:37.849
Can we just not talk about guys
for one second?

05:38.027 --> 05:39.686
Let's do something for Hello Day.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.110
No way. l'm not getting up
in front of the whole school

05:42.281 --> 05:44.072
and singing some dumb song.

05:44.242 --> 05:45.949
lt is not dumb.
Where's your school spirit?

05:46.327 --> 05:48.118
l'm not the performer type, okay?

05:48.329 --> 05:50.286
Don't worry, we will carry you,
won't we, Donna?

05:50.456 --> 05:51.831
Yeah, it'll be fun.

05:51.999 --> 05:53.872
l mean, after an entire summer
in acting class,

05:54.043 --> 05:55.834
we might as well try
in front of an audience.

05:56.003 --> 05:57.662
That's what l'm afraid of.

05:59.298 --> 06:03.509
- Scott, my man, when did you get in?
- Last night.

06:03.677 --> 06:05.883
- So how was Oklahoma?
- Pretty decent.

06:06.055 --> 06:07.513
How was Beverly Hills?

06:08.182 --> 06:10.554
lt was cool. You know,
barbecues, babes.

06:10.767 --> 06:11.846
Did you score?

06:12.769 --> 06:14.512
Not as such. Did you?

06:14.730 --> 06:15.928
No.

06:16.106 --> 06:18.181
So, what's up with the hat?

06:18.775 --> 06:19.973
What about it?

06:20.193 --> 06:21.603
Well, isn't it a little big?

06:21.820 --> 06:24.856
No, this is the way it's supposed to be.
lt's a Stetson.

06:26.324 --> 06:29.360
Hey, l brought back some stuff
for you too.

06:29.577 --> 06:31.984
Really? You know,
l don't look so good in big hats.

06:32.205 --> 06:34.162
No. Here.

06:37.126 --> 06:40.043
- Country western.
- Yeah, C&W.

06:40.255 --> 06:44.501
Some of it's really cool.
You should play some on your show.

06:44.675 --> 06:45.706
Yeah.

07:15.497 --> 07:18.782
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:19.209 --> 07:23.040
- First day of school and you're late.
- So are you.

07:23.213 --> 07:25.419
A political decision
or did you just oversleep?

07:26.425 --> 07:28.049
A little of both, l guess.

07:29.469 --> 07:32.754
- Dylan McKay.
- Emily Valentine.

07:34.099 --> 07:38.179
New but definitely not a freshman.

07:38.645 --> 07:39.807
Transfer.

07:39.979 --> 07:43.312
- We just moved from Marin County.
- You don't sound thrilled.

07:43.524 --> 07:47.735
Oh, yeah. l love smog,
strip malls, traffic jams...

07:47.904 --> 07:52.031
- There is more to L.A. than that.
- Like what?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.157
The beach at sunrise.

07:54.327 --> 07:57.577
Santa Ana winds. Randy's Donuts.

07:58.914 --> 08:02.496
Yeah, well, maybe you could
take me out for a cruller sometime.

08:02.918 --> 08:04.293
How about now?

08:05.421 --> 08:07.247
l don't think ditching
the first day of school

08:07.423 --> 08:09.332
is a good way
to make a first impression.

08:09.717 --> 08:12.042
How about tonight?

08:22.854 --> 08:24.052
Great.

08:26.108 --> 08:28.515
At my old school, this would have fit.

08:29.611 --> 08:33.229
Well, l guess all lockers
are not created equal.

08:33.907 --> 08:36.397
- First day?
- Yup.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.864
Brandon Walsh.

08:38.203 --> 08:39.447
Emily Valentine.

08:39.663 --> 08:42.034
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:42.248 --> 08:44.869
Well, don't worry, you'll get used to it.
lf l did, anyone can.

08:45.502 --> 08:47.957
- You going my way?
- l don't know.

08:48.129 --> 08:50.038
- Well, come on anyway.
- All right.

08:50.214 --> 08:55.125
- So any survival tips?
- Stay away from the meatloaf.

08:55.303 --> 08:57.591
Any a little more relevant?

08:57.763 --> 09:00.336
l wouldn't worry about it.
You're gonna love West Beverly.

09:00.516 --> 09:03.600
l can tell already.
You're gonna fit in just fine.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.438
About as well as your guitar.

09:06.605 --> 09:08.099
- Thanks a lot.
- l was just kidding.

09:08.274 --> 09:10.313
l know a place
where you can hide that if you want.

09:10.484 --> 09:11.894
Okay.

09:13.404 --> 09:16.108
The West Beverly Blaze.
My home away from home.

09:16.282 --> 09:18.689
- You're a writer?
- Sports editor.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.820
My dad's a newspaperman.
That's why we moved here.

09:21.995 --> 09:25.909
- No kidding. He work for The Times?
- No. Far too mainstream.

09:26.083 --> 09:29.000
He founded a free press in the '60s,
and he's worked on every liberal rag

09:29.169 --> 09:31.659
from Cambridge to Berkeley
ever since.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.292
So ever get any free tickets
to Raiders games?

09:35.509 --> 09:37.003
Even if they did bail out on Oakland.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.719
No, but l do have
two press box seats

09:38.887 --> 09:41.128
for West Beverly's
exciting practise scrimmage

09:41.306 --> 09:43.013
against Beverly Hills tomorrow night.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.471
You sure you don't wanna save those
for someone special?

09:45.643 --> 09:47.552
We need to talk
about leads for your first story

09:47.729 --> 09:49.271
because l have
to push up the deadline.

09:49.439 --> 09:51.929
Given it's the first week and all,
l wanna get the paper out--

09:52.108 --> 09:53.851
Good morning, Andrea.

09:55.445 --> 09:56.607
Sorry.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.194
lt's just that l've been here since
7 a.m. and l'm so wired.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.202
l just want this year's paper
to be better than last year's, you know?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.445
Maybe even award-winning.

10:06.747 --> 10:10.530
Andrea, relax. We have all year.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.119
Right.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.834
You said you knew somewhere
l could stash this.

10:17.424 --> 10:20.175
Sorry. Andrea Zuckerman,
this is Emily...

10:20.552 --> 10:23.173
Valentine. Emily Valentine.

10:24.181 --> 10:25.295
Pleased to meet you.

10:25.516 --> 10:28.220
- Me too.
- New?

10:28.727 --> 10:31.763
l told her she could stow her axe here.
lt wouldn't fit in her locker.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.807
Her axe?

10:34.733 --> 10:35.931
Oh, yeah, right.

10:36.151 --> 10:37.645
Sure, no problem.

10:39.946 --> 10:43.528
So are you interested in working
for the school paper?

10:44.701 --> 10:46.111
Me?

10:46.286 --> 10:50.069
l don't think so. l hardly know
my way around here yet.

10:50.665 --> 10:53.416
Oh, that's too bad.

11:00.341 --> 11:01.835
No, l think we should do Motown.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.679
Go as the Supremes
or the Pointer Sisters?

11:04.846 --> 11:07.550
No, too old. You listen
to your mother's junk too much.

11:07.723 --> 11:08.921
Why don't we do a show tune?

11:09.100 --> 11:12.053
Something like
''Somewhere Over the Freeway.''

11:12.270 --> 11:14.179
Right, we'll dress up like Munchkins.

11:14.605 --> 11:16.229
Oh, wait, l've got it.

11:16.399 --> 11:17.774
You know that Robert Palmer song

11:17.983 --> 11:20.520
that Dave was playing today,
''Addicted to Love''?

11:20.694 --> 11:23.944
We could do ''Addicted to Sex.''

11:25.074 --> 11:28.489
Donna, Hello Day
is supposed to be a G-rated event.

11:28.661 --> 11:33.038
Okay, how about
''Addicted to School''?

11:33.582 --> 11:35.040
Coming from us?

11:35.209 --> 11:36.407
No.

11:36.585 --> 11:38.127
How about ''Addicted to Clothes''?

11:38.754 --> 11:41.291
- That's perfect.
- Perfect.

11:44.968 --> 11:47.755
- Hi.
- Who are you?

11:48.513 --> 11:50.339
The newest member of your group?

11:52.809 --> 11:55.928
Listen, B, l gotta talk to you
for a minute.

11:56.104 --> 11:58.096
About something other than food?

11:58.273 --> 12:02.056
Yeah. Listen, you know me and Bren
been kind of on-again, off-again...

12:02.235 --> 12:04.026
You're kidding me. Wha--?

12:04.195 --> 12:06.864
Brenda-Dylan, Dylan-Brenda.
lt's all l've been hearing all summer.

12:07.031 --> 12:09.403
- l don't wanna hear it anymore.
- l know, it's old news.

12:09.575 --> 12:11.900
But l got a date tonight
and l wanna bring her by the Pit.

12:12.078 --> 12:13.951
And l wanna make sure
it wasn't gonna be weird.

12:14.121 --> 12:16.991
Weird? Me?

12:17.166 --> 12:19.123
Yeah.

12:19.961 --> 12:22.119
Just out of curiosity,
what kind of car do you drive?

12:22.296 --> 12:23.327
Beemer.

12:23.547 --> 12:25.954
- Really? How about you, Donna?
- Beemer.

12:26.759 --> 12:27.790
What a surprise.

12:27.968 --> 12:30.293
Like the kids in San Francisco
don't drive nice cars.

12:30.471 --> 12:32.214
Especially Marin County.

12:33.182 --> 12:35.886
l'm just giving you guys a hard time.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.554
How about you, Bren?
What do you got?

12:37.728 --> 12:39.103
Porsche, Jag, Ferrari?

12:39.313 --> 12:42.183
- What is it?
- Actually, l don't have a car.

12:42.482 --> 12:45.352
No wheels?
l thought nobody walked in L.A.

12:45.527 --> 12:48.278
Well, they do
if they don't have a driver's licence.

12:48.822 --> 12:50.316
Thanks, Donna.

12:52.951 --> 12:55.868
- Brandon.
- Emily, hi.

12:56.496 --> 12:57.740
You live here?

12:58.123 --> 12:59.154
You didn't know?

12:59.332 --> 13:02.083
This is the home
of the Minnesota twins.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.493
You're kidding. You and Brenda?

13:04.712 --> 13:08.246
Yeah, l know,
it's kind of hard for me to believe too.

13:08.424 --> 13:10.297
Well, l don't wanna interrupt
genius here.

13:10.468 --> 13:13.005
l gotta get ready for work. See you.

13:14.013 --> 13:15.804
l can't believe
Brandon's your brother.

13:16.224 --> 13:17.504
Yeah.

13:17.683 --> 13:20.600
Well, now that you know
the whole family,

13:20.770 --> 13:22.347
we're having a barbecue
Wednesday night.

13:22.521 --> 13:23.635
Why don't you join us?

13:24.398 --> 13:26.057
Sure, l'd love to.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.269
Hello.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.107
Oh, yes, hello, Dylan.

13:34.575 --> 13:35.985
l'm fine, thank you.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.155
Just a minute. l'll get him.

13:38.871 --> 13:40.329
lt's for Brandon.

13:41.707 --> 13:43.746
l knew that.

13:43.959 --> 13:46.746
You know,
l met a guy named Dylan today.

13:47.170 --> 13:50.336
- Dylan McKay?
- Yeah, l think so.

13:52.134 --> 13:53.676
Porsche Speedster?

13:54.302 --> 13:57.089
Cute little scar on his right eyebrow?

13:57.889 --> 13:59.928
Yeah, that would be him.

14:14.364 --> 14:17.234
- Haven't lost your touch, Walsh.
- lt's just like riding a bike, Nat.

14:17.408 --> 14:19.815
Yeah, well, pedal faster.
We're backing up.

14:19.994 --> 14:22.152
- Emily, Dylan.
- Hey, man.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.903
- We gotta stop meeting like this.
- Yeah.

14:25.082 --> 14:27.074
Look, there's a couple
of stools there. Sit down.

14:27.251 --> 14:29.290
l'll be with you in a second.

14:30.379 --> 14:33.083
- You know Brandon?
- Doesn't everybody?

14:33.257 --> 14:35.083
So does this pretty new face
have a name?

14:35.259 --> 14:36.753
Hey, Nat.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.670
l'd like to introduce Emily Valentine.

14:38.846 --> 14:40.885
l hear you make
the best burgers and fries in town.

14:41.056 --> 14:42.680
Oh, l like this girl.

14:43.434 --> 14:44.632
Got a quarter for the jukebox?

14:44.810 --> 14:47.597
Come on, it's on the house.
Come, come, come.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.935
Dylan, when you said
you were bringing somebody by,

14:51.108 --> 14:53.100
l didn't realise you meant Emily.

14:53.277 --> 14:54.605
So, what's the big deal?

14:55.529 --> 14:57.236
l've got a date with her
tomorrow night.

14:59.324 --> 15:00.866
Hey, fellas.

15:01.827 --> 15:05.195
You gotta watch out for this one.
You got a heartbreaker on your hands.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.006
Brenda, she said
he had a cute scar.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.677
What do you think
is gonna happen?

15:20.845 --> 15:23.170
Kelly, are you gonna do
any homework this year?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.596
Brenda, you better tell her
about you and Dylan

15:25.767 --> 15:27.095
before something happens.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.682
Kelly, l made up my mind.
We're seeing other people.

15:29.854 --> 15:32.724
Brenda, you're not.

15:38.529 --> 15:40.854
Welcome to L.A.

15:43.325 --> 15:45.116
lt's spectacular.

15:46.328 --> 15:48.035
You're pretty spectacular too.

16:03.804 --> 16:05.463
To be fair,

16:05.639 --> 16:09.090
l think l should tell you
that l just broke up with someone.

16:12.312 --> 16:15.431
We're not really broken up,

16:15.607 --> 16:20.767
but we're not really together either.

16:23.531 --> 16:26.697
l'm not looking
for anything really heavy right now.

16:27.744 --> 16:29.902
Who said anything was heavy?

16:47.263 --> 16:48.922
Hey, Bren.

16:49.098 --> 16:51.933
Guess who showed up
at the Peach Pit tonight.

16:52.101 --> 16:55.351
- Brandon, l'm trying to study.
- With Emily Valentine.

16:57.022 --> 16:58.895
- Who?
- Dylan.

17:00.275 --> 17:02.267
Well, Dylan is free to see
whoever he wants.

17:02.486 --> 17:04.478
- You mean that?
- Yes.

17:04.695 --> 17:07.151
And l am not gonna be
a jealous person.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.035
Well, if you can handle it, so can l.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.003
- Hello.
- Kelly, it's me.

17:24.174 --> 17:28.218
You were right about Emily.
She made the first move.

17:46.862 --> 17:48.272
Boy, am l glad to see you.

17:48.447 --> 17:50.439
- What's up?
- Look, l've really gotta go.

17:50.616 --> 17:52.323
Could you cover me
while l hit the head?

17:52.493 --> 17:54.781
Sure, what do l have to do?

17:54.954 --> 17:58.654
As soon as this cut's over,
push this button. As soon as it's over.

17:58.832 --> 18:00.290
No sweat.

18:00.459 --> 18:01.703
You sure?

18:01.877 --> 18:04.913
Yeah, l told you. Go.

18:05.464 --> 18:07.088
Okay.

18:18.602 --> 18:20.144
l don't know if l can handle this.

18:20.312 --> 18:23.147
l didn't think anything
would happen this fast.

18:23.315 --> 18:25.188
l almost called you
at the RAP-Line last night.

18:25.358 --> 18:27.480
Well, you know you always can.

18:27.652 --> 18:31.815
l was so sure of myself.
l thought that l had it all figured out.

18:32.490 --> 18:33.984
There's not a lot you can do,
Brenda.

18:34.158 --> 18:36.565
l mean, you told Dylan
to see other people,

18:36.786 --> 18:38.612
and Emily can go out
with anyone she wants.

18:38.788 --> 18:41.243
l know, and l know you're right.

18:41.582 --> 18:43.907
Besides, l mean, it's not like
it's anything serious.

18:44.335 --> 18:47.538
She's going out with a lot of guys.
She has a date with Brandon tonight.

18:48.547 --> 18:49.626
She is?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.464
Yeah.

18:52.385 --> 18:53.927
Where are they going?

18:59.433 --> 19:01.758
Hey, Corvette.

19:01.936 --> 19:05.269
- How is my funny Valentine?
- Lost.

19:05.439 --> 19:07.645
You know where the tech room is?

19:08.859 --> 19:11.266
Oh, l was close.

19:11.445 --> 19:15.110
You know, in some cultures,
if a guy helps a lost girl,

19:15.282 --> 19:17.321
- they're romantically linked for life.
- Oh, yeah?

19:17.492 --> 19:20.279
l read Margaret Mead last year,
but l must have missed that chapter.

19:21.455 --> 19:23.530
Well, thanks.

19:25.917 --> 19:29.499
- Did you see that?
- l don't believe this.

19:29.963 --> 19:31.955
l do.

19:33.007 --> 19:36.210
You know, there's a name
for a girl like that.

19:36.803 --> 19:38.510
Ladies.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.090
Slut.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.140
- What the hell are you doing?
- Great song, huh?

19:52.318 --> 19:55.769
All l asked you to do
was push one little button.

19:57.323 --> 20:00.608
lf anyone can name that tune,
pizza's on me.

20:01.452 --> 20:03.278
What are you trying to do,
ruin my reputation?

20:03.787 --> 20:05.494
Not everyone has your taste, David.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.615
The whole school does.
l'm a tastemaker.

20:07.958 --> 20:08.989
Oh, yeah, l forgot.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.792
Now that you hang out
with Kelly Taylor,

20:11.003 --> 20:12.201
you're Fred Cool.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.707
lt's Joe Cool,
and l'm not that.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.790
And this has nothing to do
with Kelly Taylor.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.843
You hijacked my show,
and that's not cool.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.389
Those are good.

20:26.810 --> 20:30.013
- Hey, guys. Room for one more?
- lt's a big lawn.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.227
Listen, l know we were supposed
to rehearse this afternoon,

20:34.401 --> 20:37.437
but l hate to bail, but l forgot
l have a doctor's appointment.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.687
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.939
My mother's taking me
to the gynaecologist.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.689
- l'm going on the pill.
- Your mother?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.244
You're kidding.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.155
l have two sisters
that weren't so smart,

20:48.373 --> 20:51.872
so by the time it got to me l guess
she figured better safe than sorry.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.952
Smart move.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.087
Excuse me.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.045
Dylan.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.927
- We need to talk.
- About what?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.385
- About Emily Valentine.
- What about her?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.846
- Are you gonna see her again?
- l don't know. Maybe.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.344
Did you know that she was going out
with Brandon tonight?

21:12.521 --> 21:15.687
Bren, why don't you just knit her
a scarlet letter?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.179
Just forget about it.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.108
Glad to.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.147
l can't win with you, Brenda.
What the hell do you want from me?

21:23.574 --> 21:25.531
l mean, first of all, you cut me loose.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.370
You made a big production about
how we ought to see other people.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.822
So l did. And now
you're throwing it back in my face.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.246
Look, l didn't think
it would happen that fast.

21:35.001 --> 21:36.993
lt seemed like forever to me.

21:38.129 --> 21:40.454
So tell me, Dylan,
why are you really going out with her?

21:40.632 --> 21:43.087
- Because you like her or because--?
- Because what?

21:43.718 --> 21:45.425
Because she'll sleep with you.

21:46.387 --> 21:48.628
You can't have it both ways, Bren.

21:48.848 --> 21:51.932
The fact of the matter is, you gave up
any right to ask me questions

21:52.143 --> 21:55.891
about my sex life when you decided
you didn't wanna be a part of it.

22:04.071 --> 22:06.608
He didn't actually say
he slept with her.

22:06.782 --> 22:08.655
And he didn't say he didn't.

22:08.993 --> 22:10.487
l mean, don't you guys see?

22:10.661 --> 22:13.448
l wouldn't sleep with him
so he found somebody that would.

22:13.664 --> 22:15.952
Brenda, calm down.
You're jumping to conclusions.

22:17.543 --> 22:19.085
Last song of the day, folks,

22:19.294 --> 22:22.378
and l wanna dedicate it
to the hottest girl in the halls.

22:22.548 --> 22:25.121
l don't know if l can take
another year of this.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.458
l don't know your name,
beautiful one,

22:27.636 --> 22:30.471
but l hear you ride a mean bike.

22:31.014 --> 22:32.757
Who's he talking about?

22:32.933 --> 22:35.340
Emily Valentine rides a motorcycle.

22:36.311 --> 22:40.225
l guess you're not David Silver's
primo fantasy anymore, huh?

22:40.398 --> 22:41.975
l'm devastated.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.140
This guy talking about me?

22:45.695 --> 22:48.731
lt sounds like you've inherited
the David Silver Fan Club.

22:48.948 --> 22:51.106
Should l be flattered?

22:51.284 --> 22:52.315
Yeah, Emily.

22:52.493 --> 22:54.319
l guess all the guys
are lining up for you.

22:54.954 --> 22:56.282
What's that supposed to mean?

22:56.497 --> 22:57.528
Nothing.

22:57.707 --> 23:00.458
Have a good time
at the gynaecologist.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.838
What's with her?

23:07.091 --> 23:11.337
Emily, Brenda's been going out
with Dylan McKay for almost a year.

23:11.929 --> 23:13.886
Oh, God.

23:15.474 --> 23:17.466
He told me he was
just coming off a relationship,

23:17.643 --> 23:19.018
but he didn't say with who.

23:19.937 --> 23:21.763
Now you know.

23:37.871 --> 23:39.578
Listen, l--

23:39.748 --> 23:43.413
l just wanted to say
l'm sorry for what happened.

23:44.669 --> 23:47.338
Turns out some kids
actually like that kind of music.

23:47.505 --> 23:51.798
- Really? l told you--
- Don't let it happen again.

23:52.177 --> 23:53.635
Okay.

23:53.803 --> 23:56.424
So you wanna come over tonight?

23:57.432 --> 23:59.471
l'd love to,

23:59.642 --> 24:03.224
but l'm supposed to have dinner
with my dad and Kelly and her mom.

24:03.438 --> 24:04.718
lt's kind of a big deal.

24:04.897 --> 24:06.972
Well, maybe tomorrow then.

24:07.150 --> 24:09.605
Because l brought back
something else from Oklahoma.

24:11.112 --> 24:14.231
Something really explosive.

24:15.157 --> 24:17.066
So it's your turn tonight, huh?

24:17.576 --> 24:18.607
Yup.

24:18.786 --> 24:21.276
Doesn't it bother you
that she went out with Dylan?

24:21.455 --> 24:22.865
Nope.

24:23.541 --> 24:26.625
And what would you say if l told you
Little Miss Popularity was on the pill?

24:26.794 --> 24:29.367
l'd say that
that's her business.

24:32.174 --> 24:33.833
l just think that you should be careful.

24:34.009 --> 24:36.048
No, Brenda,
l think you should be careful.

24:36.428 --> 24:38.835
What's the matter with you?
You're trying to stir things up.

24:39.056 --> 24:40.431
l like Emily. l'm gonna go out,

24:40.599 --> 24:44.430
- have a good time with her tonight.
- Fine. Go. Have a great time.

24:44.644 --> 24:45.723
l will.

24:53.570 --> 24:56.321
Let's see. l lived in Cambridge
until l was 4,

24:56.489 --> 24:58.196
and then we moved to Madison,

24:58.366 --> 25:01.781
then Sa--
No, then Eugene, then Santa Fe,

25:01.953 --> 25:04.360
then Tiburon and then here.

25:04.539 --> 25:07.076
You must be getting
pretty used to it by now.

25:07.250 --> 25:08.494
No, you never get used to it.

25:08.668 --> 25:11.455
There's nothing worse
than the first week at a new school.

25:11.629 --> 25:15.211
Except the first week
at a new school in Beverly Hills.

25:17.426 --> 25:19.584
Actually,
l'd say you're doing just fine.

25:19.762 --> 25:21.801
l was until l broke
the 1 1th commandment:

25:21.972 --> 25:24.723
Thou shalt not go out
with Brenda Walsh's boyfriend.

25:24.934 --> 25:27.804
That's my fault.
l was the one who told her.

25:28.187 --> 25:30.856
lt's not your fault, Brandon,
and it's not Dylan's.

25:31.065 --> 25:32.096
lt's not mine either.

25:32.274 --> 25:33.472
lf Brenda had a problem,

25:33.692 --> 25:35.316
she should have
said something to me.

25:35.527 --> 25:38.860
She didn't really have a chance.
Things happened kind of fast.

25:39.656 --> 25:42.111
So l like guys and guys like me.
What's wrong with that?

25:42.659 --> 25:44.201
Nothing.

26:05.849 --> 26:08.339
Well, this is it.

26:08.685 --> 26:10.428
What do you think?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.097
lt's incredible.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.894
l've been driven
to a lot of make-out spots,

26:16.734 --> 26:18.691
but l gotta tell you,
L.A. takes the prize.

26:19.821 --> 26:22.774
You think l just brought you here
to make out?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.529
Didn't you?

26:33.125 --> 26:34.583
Well, not completely.

26:37.087 --> 26:38.581
Good.

26:58.024 --> 27:00.479
Brandon, there's something
l gotta tell you.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.940
ln the not-playing-games
department.

27:04.572 --> 27:05.603
What's that?

27:08.660 --> 27:11.530
l came here last night with Dylan.

27:17.001 --> 27:21.294
Well, l guess l'm losing points
in the originality department, aren't l?

27:22.590 --> 27:26.124
Well, that's okay. You can
make up for it in other areas.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.860
Yo, D, you got a minute?

27:54.037 --> 27:55.495
- Sure.
- You know, l went out

27:55.664 --> 27:57.158
- with Emily last night.
- l know.

27:57.332 --> 28:00.202
And l kind of dig her.
And l think she kind of digs me.

28:00.377 --> 28:02.286
Well, congratulations.
You guys getting married?

28:02.462 --> 28:06.376
No. l just wanted to know how serious
things got between you two, that's all.

28:06.549 --> 28:09.039
lf everything's so great,
what are you worried about me for?

28:09.219 --> 28:12.172
Well, l don't know.
l just wanna know where l stand.

28:13.765 --> 28:16.801
Do you remember the last time
you asked me about a girl?

28:16.976 --> 28:18.304
Yes, l do.

28:18.519 --> 28:21.852
Do you remember that l warned you,
if you did it again, l'd get a free shot?

28:22.065 --> 28:23.096
l remember.

28:23.274 --> 28:25.147
- l meant it, you know.
- l know.

28:25.359 --> 28:28.609
ln that case, are you sure
you wanna continue this conversation?

28:29.155 --> 28:32.108
Yeah. Just not the nose.

28:33.242 --> 28:34.866
What do you wanna know, Walsh?

28:35.578 --> 28:36.953
Did you sleep with her, man?

28:37.955 --> 28:40.410
No. Satisfied?

28:40.749 --> 28:42.658
- Yes.
- Good.

28:42.835 --> 28:46.038
All right, go ahead. Free shot.

28:47.715 --> 28:49.837
Not worth it.

28:51.885 --> 28:57.009
Black Cats, M-80s, Roman Candles...
What do you think?

28:57.224 --> 28:58.386
l hate fireworks.

28:58.559 --> 29:02.177
Since when?
We used to do this all the time.

29:02.354 --> 29:05.438
But that's when we were 9
and l used to play with G.l. Joes.

29:05.607 --> 29:08.560
Okay, you're right. So it's kids' stuff.

29:08.735 --> 29:10.692
But look at this.

29:16.284 --> 29:17.612
lt's a .22.

29:17.786 --> 29:19.695
My grandfather bought it for me
in Tulsa.

29:20.121 --> 29:21.449
Pretty cool, huh?

29:24.375 --> 29:26.166
Yeah. Yeah, l guess so.

29:26.544 --> 29:29.331
This baby can take out a bird's eye
at 500 yards.

29:30.965 --> 29:32.293
Fascinating.

29:32.508 --> 29:36.256
lt's even more accurate
with a calibrated scope.

29:36.429 --> 29:39.382
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check it out.

29:42.977 --> 29:44.519
Have you lost your mind?

29:45.604 --> 29:47.643
- Wanna try?
- No, l don't.

29:47.857 --> 29:50.063
What's the matter?
l know what l'm doing.

29:50.276 --> 29:52.185
l just don't find this all very amusing.

29:53.112 --> 29:54.689
Oh, come on.

29:54.863 --> 29:57.104
We were just having some fun.

29:57.658 --> 30:01.987
Well, l'm not.
l'll see you around the corral, partner.

30:07.668 --> 30:09.826
All right,
who called for another rare one?

30:10.003 --> 30:11.627
l did.

30:11.838 --> 30:13.462
- Here you go.
- l'll bet.

30:13.632 --> 30:15.090
l can't believe she came.

30:15.258 --> 30:16.835
Why not?
All her boyfriends are here.

30:17.010 --> 30:19.049
l like the dip myself.
Did you bring your guitar?

30:19.220 --> 30:20.714
Yeah, l did. lt's in the living room.

30:21.514 --> 30:23.387
Go get it. We could use
some music around here.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.880
Okay.

30:25.268 --> 30:27.675
Oh, great. A hootenanny.

30:28.104 --> 30:31.935
- Brenda.
- Excuse me. l didn't mean to be rude.

30:35.236 --> 30:37.145
Yes, you did.

30:37.321 --> 30:40.487
ln fact, it seems like you're going out
of your way to be rude to me, Brenda.

30:40.741 --> 30:44.821
Well, Em, why don't you just go
get your guitar and bring it back in here

30:44.996 --> 30:47.321
and we'll all gather around
and swoon.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.493
Hey, you're the one that invited me
to this party, remember?

30:50.668 --> 30:53.787
lf you want me to leave, just ask.
l'll be happy to oblige.

30:53.963 --> 30:56.798
Oh, and disappoint your fans?
l wouldn't dream of it.

30:57.216 --> 31:00.382
- Brenda.
- Dylan, stay out of it.

31:00.552 --> 31:02.758
This is between me and Emily.

31:04.681 --> 31:07.432
This isn't Beverly Hills,
it's Knots Landing.

31:07.601 --> 31:09.926
When l got to school,
they should've given me a scorecard

31:10.103 --> 31:11.929
so l could keep track
of everyone's boyfriend.

31:12.105 --> 31:14.144
Oh, yeah, like that would have
made any difference.

31:14.357 --> 31:15.685
Oh, grow up, Brenda!

31:15.859 --> 31:19.986
You, of all people, should know what
it's like to be the new kid in school.

31:24.534 --> 31:27.321
All l was trying to do
was make friends.

31:27.996 --> 31:30.154
l shouldn't have bothered.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.329
Emily, come on.

31:37.380 --> 31:39.004
You happy now?

31:52.061 --> 31:54.682
l've never seen you
behave like that before.

31:54.897 --> 31:57.732
What did this girl do that's so awful?

31:57.900 --> 32:00.817
She's going out with Dylan, okay?

32:00.986 --> 32:02.859
l thought she was going out
with Brandon.

32:03.030 --> 32:05.437
Yeah, she is. She's very busy.

32:05.616 --> 32:07.407
l don't think you're being fair.

32:07.910 --> 32:09.819
Mom, if you could see her in action...

32:09.995 --> 32:13.161
l mean, l've never seen someone
move that fast.

32:13.624 --> 32:15.949
Well, she doesn't seem
like that kind of girl to me.

32:16.126 --> 32:19.126
The other day when she was
over here, she was so friendly.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.913
l think she's just trying to fit in.

32:22.090 --> 32:24.545
Yeah, she's friendly all right.
Very friendly.

32:24.718 --> 32:26.591
ln fact, l'm sure all the boys
at West Beverly

32:26.761 --> 32:28.385
she'll make very, very happy.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.635
Brenda, just put yourself
in her place.

32:31.808 --> 32:34.263
Last year, you were
the new girl at school.

32:34.477 --> 32:35.852
Yes, Mom, l know.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.593
lt's just every single time
l think of Dylan and Emily together,

32:38.773 --> 32:40.682
l can't stand it.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.933
Oh, Brenda.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.730
She doesn't love him, Mom.

32:50.701 --> 32:51.732
Do you?

32:53.079 --> 32:56.032
- l miss him.
- A lot?

32:56.207 --> 32:58.413
So much.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.953
Then maybe
you should be with him.

33:02.755 --> 33:05.958
l can't believe you're saying this
after everything that happened.

33:06.133 --> 33:07.876
l mean, what would Dad say?

33:08.177 --> 33:10.881
He'd say he wants you
to be happy too.

33:19.396 --> 33:21.471
Brandon, don't hate me.

33:22.899 --> 33:24.227
l don't.

33:28.738 --> 33:30.979
Well, good night.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.954
Up on the left.

33:45.004 --> 33:48.752
Oh, and sound check
in ten minutes, okay?

33:50.510 --> 33:52.134
What am l forgetting?

33:52.345 --> 33:54.052
That this is supposed to be fun?

33:54.263 --> 33:57.631
No, it's not fun until it's over.
Right now it's a mess.

33:59.810 --> 34:01.968
- Hi, Kel.
- Where's Emily?

34:02.146 --> 34:04.471
After last night,
l don't think she's gonna show.

34:05.232 --> 34:06.394
Perfect.

34:06.567 --> 34:08.641
Cancel ''Addicted to Clothes.''
We're not going on.

34:08.860 --> 34:10.059
What?

34:10.237 --> 34:12.359
You can't do this to me.
l'm gonna bomb up here.

34:12.531 --> 34:15.567
- You guys are the best act we've got.
- Forget it, David.

34:15.743 --> 34:18.530
Without Emily Valentine,
we don't even have an act.

34:20.789 --> 34:24.074
Oh, that's great.
You know what this means?

34:24.251 --> 34:27.286
That l've gotta close
with Jamie Thurman

34:27.462 --> 34:29.750
and the Dancing Soda Cans.

34:30.297 --> 34:33.002
Thanks. Thanks a lot, guys.

34:36.679 --> 34:39.052
You know, l don't blame her.
You were pretty awful.

34:39.391 --> 34:43.139
Look, you guys, l know.
But what should l do now?

34:43.853 --> 34:47.387
Find her. Apologise.
And if that doesn't work, beg.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.398
Emily, wait.

34:59.827 --> 35:01.736
Oh, look. lf it isn't the president

35:01.913 --> 35:04.119
of the West Beverly
Welcoming Committee.

35:04.790 --> 35:06.663
Okay, l deserve that.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.826
And anything else
you wanna say about me.

35:09.044 --> 35:11.036
l don't have anything
to say to you, Brenda.

35:11.755 --> 35:13.581
Look, Emily,

35:14.133 --> 35:15.164
l'm sorry.

35:16.343 --> 35:18.715
l don't know
what got into me last night.

35:19.471 --> 35:21.130
Can't we forget everything
and start over?

35:21.306 --> 35:24.390
- Can't you give me another chance?
- Yeah, right.

35:25.561 --> 35:28.894
You know what
the really lousy thing is, Brenda?

35:29.856 --> 35:31.266
l liked you.

35:32.109 --> 35:35.275
And so l opened up
and l was honest,

35:35.445 --> 35:37.982
but you turned that against me.

35:38.198 --> 35:39.857
The next time
you call someone a slut,

35:40.033 --> 35:41.859
maybe you should get
your facts straight.

35:42.077 --> 35:43.903
Emily, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean it like that.

35:44.079 --> 35:46.404
No, you think l sleep around.

35:46.998 --> 35:48.789
Well, l don't.

35:50.794 --> 35:53.082
For your information, l'm a virgin.

35:53.671 --> 35:55.046
Then why are you on the pill?

35:55.715 --> 35:59.795
l wanna be prepared
if and when the time comes.

36:01.596 --> 36:04.762
l'm sorry l got the wrong idea.
l totally jumped to conclusions.

36:05.641 --> 36:08.926
- You thought l slept with Dylan.
- Yes.

36:09.103 --> 36:11.060
You really think
l could have done that

36:11.230 --> 36:13.685
and gone out with your brother
the next night?

36:13.899 --> 36:16.057
No. l mean, yes.

36:16.235 --> 36:18.560
Emily, l'm sorry.
What else do you want me to say?

36:19.280 --> 36:21.817
- l don't know.
- Please. Even if you can't stand me,

36:21.991 --> 36:24.446
that doesn't mean
you can't hang with Kelly and Donna.

36:24.660 --> 36:28.574
Oh, right.
l'll be the fourth musketeer.

36:28.789 --> 36:30.995
No, it's not like that at all.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.288
Matter of fact,
after the way l behaved last night,

36:33.460 --> 36:34.622
if l don't get you on-stage,

36:34.795 --> 36:37.167
neither of them
are gonna talk to me again.

36:38.131 --> 36:43.291
Besides, how can you disappoint
a horde of drooling freshmen?

36:54.063 --> 36:56.980
We were gonna do a send-up
called ''Addicted to Clothes.''

36:57.150 --> 37:00.186
But it promoted your basic stereotype
of what life is like in Beverly Hills

37:00.361 --> 37:02.234
instead of what's really important.

37:02.405 --> 37:04.112
So we thought,
for you freshmen out there,

37:04.282 --> 37:06.689
it might be better to do something
a little more real.

37:06.868 --> 37:08.825
A little closer to the heart.

37:09.036 --> 37:11.028
Okay, hit it.

37:23.551 --> 37:27.050
Breaking up is hard to do

37:27.262 --> 37:32.801
Don't take your love away from me

37:32.976 --> 37:36.012
Don't you leave my heart in misery

37:36.813 --> 37:39.932
lf you go then l'll be blue

37:40.108 --> 37:42.729
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

37:42.903 --> 37:48.822
Remember when you held me tight?

37:49.034 --> 37:52.237
And you kissed me
All through the night?

37:52.704 --> 37:55.907
Think of all that we've been through

37:56.082 --> 37:58.703
Breaking up is hard to do

37:58.918 --> 38:03.544
They say that breaking up
ls hard to do

38:03.715 --> 38:05.292
Pretty talented, huh?

38:05.466 --> 38:08.466
Yeah, she's got
a pretty good voice, l guess.

38:08.636 --> 38:10.758
Can she write?

38:12.098 --> 38:13.508
Oh, Andrea.

38:13.683 --> 38:16.008
l wish that we were making up again

38:16.227 --> 38:21.897
l beg of you, don't say goodbye

38:22.108 --> 38:25.523
Can't we give our love
A brand-new try?

38:26.070 --> 38:29.154
Come on, baby, let's start anew

38:29.323 --> 38:32.074
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

38:33.952 --> 38:35.362
Hi.

38:35.537 --> 38:36.865
Hey.

38:37.039 --> 38:38.865
The show's great.

38:39.041 --> 38:40.665
Yeah.

38:41.293 --> 38:43.534
l really liked the Dancing Soda Cans.

38:44.254 --> 38:46.744
l'm surprised
you didn't shoot them off a fence.

38:48.383 --> 38:51.798
Hey, l'm sorry about yesterday.

38:52.345 --> 38:54.918
l didn't know
the rifle would weird you out.

38:55.098 --> 38:56.805
You sure did change this summer.

38:58.768 --> 39:02.101
l just went away for vacation.
l didn't change that much.

39:03.148 --> 39:04.939
Well, maybe l did.

39:05.650 --> 39:09.398
l know. You're a big man
around here now,

39:09.904 --> 39:11.695
and l'm still a geek.

39:12.365 --> 39:14.357
You're not a geek.

39:15.743 --> 39:17.949
Maybe we can hang out next week.

39:19.288 --> 39:21.529
Yeah. l'll call you.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.784
Yeah.

39:25.127 --> 39:26.834
Scott.

39:27.213 --> 39:28.292
Yeah?

39:29.507 --> 39:31.333
Cool it with the guns, will you?

39:33.010 --> 39:34.041
Okay.

39:36.263 --> 39:38.884
Breaking up is hard to do

39:39.099 --> 39:44.472
l beg of you, don't say goodbye

39:44.646 --> 39:48.014
Can't we give our love
A brand-new try?

39:48.233 --> 39:51.648
Come on, baby, let's start anew

39:51.820 --> 39:55.769
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

39:55.949 --> 40:00.076
Breaking up is hard to do

40:13.049 --> 40:14.080
We were awesome.

40:14.259 --> 40:16.963
Did you hear that applause?
lt was so cool. l loved being up there.

40:17.136 --> 40:19.508
Oh, great, she's bitten.
We're all in trouble now.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.965
- lt's incurable, you know.
- So, what are you guys gonna go do?

40:23.184 --> 40:25.509
l'm supposed to meet my mom.
Oh, my God, l'm totally late.

40:25.686 --> 40:27.725
- l'm babysitting.
- Well, l'll drop you off.

40:27.939 --> 40:29.896
Okay. Emily, thank you.
You were great.

40:30.066 --> 40:32.188
You guys were great too.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.850
How about you, Brenda?
What are you gonna do tonight?

40:36.030 --> 40:39.233
Oh, l don't know. l thought
l'd go home, watch some TV,

40:39.450 --> 40:40.481
study.

40:40.659 --> 40:43.494
You know,
l think Knots Landing is on tonight.

40:54.214 --> 40:57.417
Brenda, l know it's none of my
business, but l'm gonna say it anyway.

40:57.968 --> 40:59.212
What?

40:59.678 --> 41:01.337
He's a hell of a guy.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.389
Whatever you've got,
don't throw it away.

41:12.148 --> 41:13.392
Thanks.

41:31.584 --> 41:34.074
Dylan, can we start over?

41:35.046 --> 41:36.374
From where?

41:36.547 --> 41:40.959
The beginning, middle,
where we left off?

41:42.511 --> 41:44.384
l don't know.

41:46.682 --> 41:50.181
After everything l went through,
l got scared.

41:51.103 --> 41:53.178
l needed time to think things out.

41:55.065 --> 41:57.104
So, what'd you come up with?

41:59.444 --> 42:01.021
That l missed you.

42:02.572 --> 42:04.647
That l needed you.

42:05.951 --> 42:08.620
That what we've got
is much more than just physical.

42:09.371 --> 42:13.119
Bren, l'm not here because of that.

42:13.291 --> 42:15.579
l never was.

42:15.752 --> 42:17.709
l'm here because l love you.

42:19.422 --> 42:21.379
l love you too.

42:35.938 --> 42:39.022
Nothing happened
with me and Emily.

42:39.191 --> 42:41.100
l mean, l kissed her.

42:41.402 --> 42:44.319
But that's it.

42:45.489 --> 42:47.611
Dylan, you were right.

42:48.325 --> 42:50.151
lt was none of my business.

42:53.289 --> 42:55.364
Look, l'm sorry.

42:57.334 --> 42:59.955
l'm sorry for everything
that l put you through.

43:00.170 --> 43:03.669
Whatever it took to get you here,

43:03.840 --> 43:05.334
it was worth it.

43:18.355 --> 43:19.932
l missed this.

43:20.148 --> 43:22.306
Yeah, me too.
