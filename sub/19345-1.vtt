02:45.899 --> 02:47.533
You're panting.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.536
Richie better not
show up now, dude.

02:51.371 --> 02:55.674
This little caper of ours is
not something he would like.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.876
They're shipping a lot of shit
here without him knowing.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.711
He likes to be in the know.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.813
It seems very shady.

03:02.482 --> 03:03.715
Connor.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.331
Alright, not too
much cutting, ash.

03:24.804 --> 03:25.971
Hurry up.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.445
I'm serious.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.926
She's a beauty.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.309
We need to go.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.378
Let's get this stuff.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.549
Ash, let's go.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.587
All the peanuts.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.289
All of them.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.278
Pick them up.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.284
- Ash!
- Shit.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.890
He's here.

05:01.901 --> 05:02.801
Alright, come on.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.669
Wanna go have breakfast?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.404
Let's go have breakfast.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.677
Oh!

05:14.447 --> 05:16.348
Alright, okay.

05:16.350 --> 05:16.348
Let's go in the shop.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.751
What, you don't
wanna go in the shop?

05:20.888 --> 05:21.687
Come on, come on.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.521
We gotta go to work.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.855
Come on.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.047
You happy now?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.649
Oh.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.143
Ash.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.104
Hey, put that away.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.439
Dude.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.074
Calm down.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.175
Ash, that's something
i would say.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.010
You don't get to talk like me.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.179
Will you shut up?

06:58.718 --> 06:59.718
What?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.053
No. No, Connor.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.955
I'm putting this away
because it's the right

07:03.957 --> 07:06.558
thing to do, not
because you told me to.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.193
- Okay?
- Let's go.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.128
Ash.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.897
Jesus.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.784
I don't understand.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.886
Why are there so many?

07:36.656 --> 07:38.156
Ash, what do we get?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.560
I don't know.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.094
You're the mechanic.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.564
You should know.

07:46.699 --> 07:50.068
You know mechanic is not the
same thing as being a maid, ash.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.105
Check this out.

07:55.176 --> 07:56.075
Whoa.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.177
Everything alright back there?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.614
Oh, Connor.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.716
So boys, what have we learned?

08:04.718 --> 08:05.951
Leave ash at home.

08:05.953 --> 08:05.951
Yup.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.987
And if you wanna topple
a mountain, go for my

08:08.989 --> 08:12.057
selection of spray
breeze in aisle five.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.625
Will do.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.128
Good luck.
Whatever you're up to.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.152
I'll give you five minutes, ash.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.857
Seriously?

08:46.592 --> 08:48.093
Hey!

08:53.966 --> 08:56.668
So, where you off to?

08:57.069 --> 08:58.937
Going to clean out
my dad's trailer.

08:58.939 --> 08:58.937
Where are you guys going?

08:58.939 --> 09:02.073
Whoa, you're going
somewhere to clean?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.742
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.976
Ash, uh...

09:04.978 --> 09:06.278
Ash is into that kinda thing.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.613
You know, he's into maids.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.881
Oh my.

09:09.883 --> 09:09.881
That's not...

09:09.883 --> 09:12.751
He's joking, he's joking.

09:13.252 --> 09:15.854
I get it, I get it, ash.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.257
Connor, what'd you
get on that bio final?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.293
65.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.194
Nice.

09:24.764 --> 09:28.700
Oh, didn't know
you guys were pals.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.036
A lot of things about
me you don't know.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.905
Oh, really?

09:37.143 --> 09:39.077
So where are you guys going?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.178
Uh, we're gonna...

09:40.180 --> 09:41.680
What's in the bag?

09:41.682 --> 09:42.347
A gun.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.082
No shit.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.085
Cleaning supplies, too.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.321
It's not a real gun, also.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.325
Cleaning supplies and a gun?

09:53.327 --> 09:53.325
Wow.

09:53.327 --> 09:57.128
What are you guys
like an amateur...

09:57.130 --> 09:59.731
What are they called, Sam?

09:59.733 --> 10:00.832
Clean-up men.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.133
Like for crime scenes.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.236
Amateur clean-up men
for a crime scene.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.909
I wanna see this gun, Connor.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.344
Yeah, we probably
shouldn't be bringing that

10:12.346 --> 10:13.812
out here, you know?

10:13.814 --> 10:14.946
Lot of cops in this town.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.848
Wouldn't wanna get shot.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.116
Connor.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.018
It's a paintball gun.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.988
What's a paintball gun?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.156
It shoots balls of paint.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.191
Oh.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.726
Yeah, Emma.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.860
You should know this.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.063
Dudes, don't gang
up on my friend.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.832
Geez, you're difficult.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.000
Excuse me?

10:35.002 --> 10:35.867
He's kinda right.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.768
Whoa, there!

10:36.770 --> 10:38.236
I'm just saying.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.941
So, where are you guys going?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.910
Uh, we're gonna bike
along the river trail.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.846
I forget what it's called.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.048
The sopes river valley trail.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.683
That.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.953
Ash, can we leave?

10:54.955 --> 10:59.090
Well, so quickly Connor
has lost interest.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.960
Yup.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.329
Alright, have fun on your bikes.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.197
See ya, Emma.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.734
- Later.
- Bye, boys.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.311
Unless you guys wanna come
clean out the trailer with us.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.980
We're good.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.168
Why the fuck was
kaufmann in there?

12:17.170 --> 12:20.105
He wasn't supposed
to fucking be here.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.407
We weren't supposed to pull
our fucking guns, Charlie.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.310
Since when does kaufmann
carry a fucking piece?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.280
What the fuck is he doing?
He's got the keys!

12:29.282 --> 12:32.083
Oh, god damnit, Cody!

12:34.787 --> 12:36.488
Oh man!

12:39.091 --> 12:39.858
Come on.

12:39.860 --> 12:40.925
Look out, look out.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.374
Motherfuckers!

12:56.976 --> 12:58.476
Goddamn you!

13:01.047 --> 13:03.014
Motherfuckers!

13:41.086 --> 13:43.021
I've been doing some
thinking, ash.

13:44.256 --> 13:47.091
Why is it I'm always doing
your chores for you?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.260
I don't think that's fair.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.063
Connor, you practically
live at my house.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.999
So you're saying i owe you?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.235
Yeah.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.304
I don't know.
Talk to my dad.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.907
I think it's my duty.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.976
I can't leave you two alone.

14:07.179 --> 14:11.316
So, how were the championships?

14:11.951 --> 14:13.451
They weren't championships.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.287
Also, that is really stupid.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.623
They weren't championships.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.124
But did you win?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.492
Yeah.

14:27.066 --> 14:30.034
You never seize
to amaze me, ash.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.403
Sometimes I think you're uh...

14:32.405 --> 14:34.472
Mentally challenged.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.609
I think I'm doing quite a
noble thing being your friend,

14:37.611 --> 14:38.977
you know?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.246
It's a lot of Patience.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.282
I'm Lenny?

14:48.554 --> 14:51.089
I'm Lenny, you're George?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.609
Why is your dad so against guns?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.646
I don't know.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.181
I guess he's seen
what a gun can do.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.585
Was he in the army?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.021
I seriously doubt that.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.191
You're saying he's a softie?

15:27.193 --> 15:28.059
Yeah.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.560
He so isn't.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.197
God damnit, why did they
pack these like this?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.199
I mean, they're
all over the place.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.238
I mean, I don't really
consider myself a gun guy,

15:40.240 --> 15:43.975
but what's not to like here?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.015
Say hello to my little friend.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.494
Do you even know
what that's from?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.398
Die hard?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.354
Where the fuck did
that come from?

16:29.356 --> 16:32.357
I don't know.
It was a personal shot.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.731
Goddamn, he's crazy, man.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.566
He was out of his mind.

16:43.104 --> 16:44.003
Just breathe.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.070
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.139
You gotta pull over.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.073
No, just keep going.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.208
Keep going.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.777
Come... come on, Mikey.
That's it.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.712
Come on, Cody.
Come on.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.184
You are gonna be alright, Cody.

17:00.619 --> 17:04.021
Jesus, none of us knew it'd
have to be our getaway.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.758
We were supposed to be
in and out of there.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.294
Nobody expected we'd have
to shoot our way out.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.663
Since when does kaufmann
carry a fucking piece?

17:13.598 --> 17:15.366
He's always the guy
without the gun.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.268
Let's everybody else
do his dirty work.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.037
Finally came to his senses.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.238
Yeah.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.472
Yeah, oh!

17:22.474 --> 17:23.374
Guess what?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.376
What?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.577
Oh shit.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.579
This old man's watch.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.748
You know he's too afraid
to wear it anymore, but I

17:30.750 --> 17:32.550
know where he keeps it.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.621
I took more than a fucking
bullet from that asshole.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.423
You sure did.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.697
How we doing on gas, Cody?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.366
Full.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.735
K, good, good, good.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.770
That's enough to get
us where we're going.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.405
I hope so.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.275
When you gonna tell us where
that is exactly, Charlie?

17:57.277 --> 18:02.380
I'll tell us when
we get closer, Cody.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.715
Is that a problem?

18:04.717 --> 18:07.351
Don't you think you gotta tell
us sooner rather than later?

18:07.353 --> 18:08.653
Cody.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.189
What?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.626
I'm gonna tell you when
i start to fucking die.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.296
What do you think of that, Cody?

18:18.298 --> 18:21.199
Unless you're still acting
like a fucking dick.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.403
I can't believe i
killed that kid.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.337
What?

18:26.339 --> 18:26.337
He wasn't a kid.

18:26.339 --> 18:32.677
He was a seventeen-year-old
kid, alright? And I shot him.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.312
What, you shot someone?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.514
Yeah, who's blood do you think
is all over me, Charlie?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.649
Fucking news to me, man,
and I don't like it.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.617
He's overreacting.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.385
He wasn't a kid.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.621
He was there to
pick up the case.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.656
Some guy that kaufmann hired.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.825
It was either you or him.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.661
Whatever it was, it's been
a long time, alright?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.196
Still feels like shit.

18:52.198 --> 18:52.196
Well, listen.

18:52.198 --> 18:56.834
Whatever happened back there,
it's what had to happen.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.603
End of story.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.806
And the whole job went to shit.

19:01.808 --> 19:01.806
Yeah.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.342
I've never seen
kaufmann so pissed.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.443
I mean, he-he-he...

19:05.445 --> 19:06.844
He was mad.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.713
No shit.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.448
No, I mean, he was
gonna shoot all of us.

19:10.450 --> 19:10.448
He was gonna kill us.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.851
Kaufmann, kaufmann
was gonna kill us.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.586
Dutch, please.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.188
Fuck you.

19:17.190 --> 19:17.188
You two have no heart.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.758
I should've killed that
fuck when I had the chance.

19:22.394 --> 19:25.196
I'd like nothing better than to
shut that little prick up.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.267
Passions are high.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.608
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

19:37.610 --> 19:37.608
Charlie.

19:37.610 --> 19:37.608
If you two hadn't abandoned me,

19:37.610 --> 19:41.679
it might have gone
differently in there.

19:42.781 --> 19:43.915
What?

19:43.917 --> 19:45.316
Fuck you say?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.618
You heard me.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.753
No, no.

19:48.755 --> 19:48.753
I wanna hear that again.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.788
What the fuck did you say?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.890
That's not fair.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.560
Listen, man, if you hadn't
started shooting, we might

19:55.562 --> 19:57.228
be in a very
different situation.

19:57.230 --> 19:57.228
That's right.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.231
What the fuck were you
doing back there, huh?

20:00.233 --> 20:02.300
And now you're gonna try to
blame all the rest of us.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.336
I should fucking shoot
you for saying that, man.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.272
But you know what? I can't
fucking move back here.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.342
Fuck.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.681
I'm just saying,
we could have done better.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.915
Ugh, you know what, man...

20:17.917 --> 20:20.985
We could've been more
effective as a team.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.620
Please, please.
Cody, please.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.522
Please shut up.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.490
You're making my heart race.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.693
Well, if we're taking
requests here, Charlie,

20:28.695 --> 20:33.297
I'd appreciate if you'd stop
bleeding out in my backseat.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.465
You're ruining my upholstery.

20:34.467 --> 20:34.465
You know, you're right, man.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.968
Can I get one of those
little handiwipes you used

20:36.970 --> 20:38.869
to carry under your
dashboard there, buddy?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.674
Dutch, give him one
of your tampons.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.698
Along with the watch!

22:42.361 --> 22:43.728
Oh, ash!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.429
We have to go.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.398
Your dad's gonna be pissed.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.767
Get your shit.

23:00.812 --> 23:03.547
I love the smell of
napalm in the morning.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.487
I love the smell of
napalm in the morning.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.490
It smells like victory.

23:13.492 --> 23:14.992
That was pretty good.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.162
Ash, that was
pretty good, right?

23:18.797 --> 23:20.097
Ash?

23:31.143 --> 23:32.510
You guys ready?

23:48.827 --> 23:49.927
Ah!

23:49.929 --> 23:51.762
Hey, Paul.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.431
Hey, jt.
How you doing?

23:53.433 --> 23:54.698
I'm doing well.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.699
How's ash?

23:55.701 --> 23:57.101
Oh, as good as ever.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.570
Golfing.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.672
Yeah, great.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.608
Ginger, Ben, you
guys remember jt?

24:04.943 --> 24:06.610
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:08.046 --> 24:09.680
Hey, how's Susan?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.215
Oh, she's great.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.484
She's uh, she's good.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.852
I thought we'd give
her some space today.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.054
She's all stressed out
about this and that.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.856
Makes the house feel real small.

24:18.858 --> 24:18.856
Right.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.792
Today is my day to be
with the kids so I

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
got some burgers, some lettuce.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.029
We're going over to the park.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.565
You tell Susan i
said hello, okay?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.732
I will.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.534
You take care of her.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.602
Sure.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.571
Oh yeah, before I forget.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.473
The denton house.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.975
I need you to get over there
and take care of that boiler.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.811
I mean, you said
you would last week.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.614
I know she's a pain in
the ass, but please.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.782
Yeah, yeah, sure.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.717
Kids, come on, let's go.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.525
Hey, jt.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.093
Don't forget what we came from.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.962
We got it good here.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.230
Real good.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.703
In you go, buddy, in you go.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.771
Put your party hats on.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.215
Slow down, Cody.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.717
Shut the fuck up.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.623
Slow down, Cody.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.761
This road is throwing with cops.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.596
What are you doing?

26:06.665 --> 26:08.566
I feel like I'm
losing you here, pal.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.633
What's going on?

26:09.635 --> 26:12.736
I'm reacting to the situation.

26:12.738 --> 26:16.173
Something you seem to
be incapable of, pal.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.775
Reacting?

26:17.777 --> 26:20.144
Okay well, I don't know
what situation it is you

26:20.146 --> 26:22.112
think you're reacting to
because you're sure as

26:22.114 --> 26:24.348
hell not reacting
to this problem.

26:24.350 --> 26:24.348
Yeah, yeah.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.718
Yeah, you know, you
know what, Cody?

26:27.720 --> 26:31.589
Maybe it's time we start
thinking about Charlie, huh?

26:32.090 --> 26:33.357
Alright.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.795
Let me ask you a
question, Dutch.

26:38.997 --> 26:42.232
You're aware that they're
after us right now.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.202
That they sent somebody
up here to chase us down.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.204
You're aware of that, right?

26:48.873 --> 26:52.109
Yes, Cody, I do realize that.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.280
Cody, what are we
gonna do about Charlie?

26:57.716 --> 26:59.049
Tell you what
we're not gonna do.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.085
We're not gonna do what
you're about to try and

27:01.087 --> 27:02.386
convince me in doing.

27:02.388 --> 27:02.386
I know.

27:02.388 --> 27:02.386
If it was anybody else,
it would be different.

27:02.388 --> 27:07.257
But this is Charlie we're
talking about, alright?

27:07.259 --> 27:09.760
I mean, if he croaks,
what happens to us?

27:09.762 --> 27:11.729
I mean, what are we gonna
do just twist in the wind?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.697
Hey, shut up.

27:13.699 --> 27:17.067
You guys sound like a couple
of pansies up there.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.236
No hospitals.
Nothing.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.106
We go straight where we're
going and we'll get help there.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.340
Fucking hell, man.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.677
Ugh, god.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.280
Where the hell are we?

27:30.282 --> 27:30.280
I don't know, Charlie.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.416
You didn't tell me
where we are going.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.818
Well, what the fuck?

27:35.954 --> 27:37.354
Oh, we overshot.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.922
We overshot, man.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.824
You gotta keep me alert.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.693
I can't fucking...

27:42.695 --> 27:43.927
My body is shutting down.

27:43.929 --> 27:43.927
Charlie.

27:43.929 --> 27:47.264
Charlie, where are
we going, Charlie?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.833
This road is taking
us farther upstate.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.736
How are we gonna know when
we get where we're going?

27:52.738 --> 27:54.772
I gotta get my phone.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.340
Oh, shit.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.276
Gimme-gimme-gimme
your phone.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.045
My phone is dead.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.180
What, did you
forget to charge it?

28:03.948 --> 28:05.916
It drowned.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.203
Howie.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.505
Howie.

29:03.508 --> 29:06.310
He milks that much
like every time.

29:06.312 --> 29:06.310
That's awesome.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.412
How have you not
seen these, dude?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.013
Like where is your childhood?

29:10.015 --> 29:12.783
Will you shut up, please?

29:13.852 --> 29:16.320
So, the trailer.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.422
Does your dad wanna sell it?

29:19.090 --> 29:22.025
I mean, that's what he says,
but he's never gonna sell it.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.894
Why are we cleaning it out then?

29:23.896 --> 29:26.230
Because he wants to sell it.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.198
Well, speak of the devil.

29:32.337 --> 29:35.305
Guys, come on.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.975
The day is half over.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.811
There's no point in
avoiding the work.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.479
The sooner you stop
avoiding it, the sooner

29:42.481 --> 29:45.015
it'll get done.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.285
You're making me do that
annoying dad thing.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.553
Sorry.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.356
I'll crack the whip,
jt, don't worry.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.057
You do that.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.895
I'll be checking in on you
guys on my way back from town.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.496
Alright.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.471
The car needs fixing.

31:17.308 --> 31:20.010
I'm open to suggestions.

31:21.112 --> 31:23.614
We passed atleast one
mechanics as we got off

31:23.616 --> 31:25.048
the main road, Cody.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.550
We give them a little
something extra.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.452
It's not a problem.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.521
It's never that simple.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.893
Alright, so then what do we do?

31:36.294 --> 31:37.961
It's my car.

31:37.963 --> 31:41.231
So why are you opposed
to what I'm suggesting?

31:41.233 --> 31:42.532
Not a mechanic.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.368
If I can fix it, I would.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.371
But I'm not, so I can't.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.172
I don't know about that.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.311
What happens when
the car breaks down?

31:54.313 --> 31:55.979
You're overreacting.

31:57.383 --> 32:00.050
I'm overreacting.

32:03.688 --> 32:06.023
I'll tell you what needs fixing.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.425
Charlie!

32:08.427 --> 32:10.394
Shit, Charlie!

32:11.197 --> 32:12.096
What is he?

32:12.097 --> 32:15.666
I don't know. I don't know,
i can't tell if he's breathing.

32:15.668 --> 32:18.435
- Check his pulse.
- I am, I am.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.237
Alright.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.105
Okay.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.375
I think I feel something.
I think I feel a pulse.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.677
I think he's in a coma.

32:26.679 --> 32:29.079
You can't get in a
coma from blood loss.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.414
Bullshit.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.317
He's just unconscious.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.285
He's got a pulse, right?

32:36.421 --> 32:37.988
Yeah.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.289
Okay, uh... unconscious.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.457
Unconscious is good, right?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.326
That's normal.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.961
We'll let him be unconscious.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.996
It's not normal.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.166
He's entering the last stages.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.469
God damnit.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.340
Charlie, god damnit.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.550
Come on.

34:46.184 --> 34:47.650
Daddy.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.257
Daddy, I got hurt.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.360
What happened, what happened?

34:57.362 --> 34:59.429
Ginger pushed me.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.798
Ginger!

35:06.204 --> 35:07.404
That doesn't look bad.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.139
I got a band aid.
Hold on.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.812
Look at this one,
matches your shirt.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.247
Nice.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.350
Alright, ready?

35:20.352 --> 35:21.118
Mhm.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.285
Hey.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.520
There.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.621
Okay.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.156
That's beautiful!

35:26.158 --> 35:27.390
Go play, okay?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.558
Alright, see you.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.494
Ginger, no.

38:19.897 --> 38:20.930
What are you doing?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.299
Rearming myself.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.066
Why?

38:23.068 --> 38:24.434
I don't know. Why not?

38:24.436 --> 38:25.635
Ah!

38:25.637 --> 38:27.437
Damn this.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.972
We're here to clean, ash.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.341
If you shoot up the
place, I'll kill you.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.642
Yeah, with what?

38:32.644 --> 38:33.810
Your broom?

38:33.812 --> 38:34.978
Mhm.

38:46.757 --> 38:47.757
Alright, that's it, that's it.

38:47.759 --> 38:48.958
I'm done.

38:54.799 --> 38:55.999
Hmm.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.767
Mine is so much better.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.070
Too artsy.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.938
Too artsy?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.615
Rats.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.061
Atleast your dad turned
the power on for us.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.083
Is that one of yours?

40:30.428 --> 40:34.030
Don't move.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.041
In.

41:19.243 --> 41:20.844
Cellphones.

41:23.547 --> 41:25.048
It's stuff for cleaning.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.828
Who knows you're here?

41:39.497 --> 41:40.230
You don't have to consult.

41:40.232 --> 41:41.865
Just answer the question.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.500
Just his dad.

41:44.101 --> 41:46.936
Is this your father's trailer?

41:46.938 --> 41:48.238
Yeah.

41:48.973 --> 41:51.174
You live here?

41:51.176 --> 41:52.675
No.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.045
What are you doing here?

41:56.047 --> 41:57.213
He sent us here to clean it out.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.948
He might sell it.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.621
Where's the nearest hospital?

42:04.623 --> 42:06.189
Not for twenty or thirty miles.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.223
We're pretty far out.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.726
How about a doctor, a clinic?

42:09.728 --> 42:11.528
What the fuck?

42:11.530 --> 42:14.264
How about somebody we can
call to come to us?

42:14.266 --> 42:15.665
A doctor?

42:15.667 --> 42:17.066
I...

42:17.068 --> 42:18.535
Yeah, yeah, there is somebody.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.136
Shut up!

42:25.943 --> 42:27.277
Not now.

42:27.912 --> 42:29.646
We gotta deal with this.

42:29.648 --> 42:33.116
We gotta deal with more
than one thing at once.

42:33.118 --> 42:35.084
The car, too, Cody.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.221
Let's try to use this
thing to our advantage.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.790
Charlie's a fucking
ticking time bomb.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.191
You're a ticking time bomb.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.794
Use this to our advantage,
what are you talking about?

42:44.796 --> 42:47.597
- Cody.
- People know they are here.

42:47.599 --> 42:50.033
What are we gonna do when
they come looking for them?

42:50.035 --> 42:51.668
See... you are not helping.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.003
This is not helping us
sort this situation out.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.839
This job has gone to shit,
but it's not over yet.

42:56.841 --> 42:59.142
Yeah, well atleast i
did my part of the job.

43:00.277 --> 43:01.711
What-what's
your plan then?

43:01.713 --> 43:02.946
What, are you gonna sit around?

43:02.948 --> 43:04.314
Wait it out?

43:07.585 --> 43:08.918
I wouldn't do that.

43:18.062 --> 43:20.363
Leave him alone, Cody.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.165
They're just scared.

43:22.167 --> 43:25.101
They're in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.870
It's start-starting to seem
like maybe we were, too.

43:27.872 --> 43:27.870
So what are you saying?

43:27.872 --> 43:31.741
I'm saying I think we made
a bad move, Cody, and all

43:31.743 --> 43:33.910
this is us answering for it.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.812
Well, why do you think I've been
calling the shots around here?

43:35.814 --> 43:35.812
Yeah, that's another thing.

43:35.814 --> 43:37.614
Who decides you get to be...

43:37.616 --> 43:40.817
Shut up!
Stop talking!

43:41.652 --> 43:44.320
What is your fucking problem?

43:45.756 --> 43:48.725
Charlie is bleeding
out in that room.

43:48.727 --> 43:54.397
Charlie, our friend and
boss of twenty years.

43:54.399 --> 43:55.698
More.

43:55.700 --> 43:58.134
More than twenty years, yes.

43:58.136 --> 44:01.070
Cody...

44:01.072 --> 44:03.806
Can you imagine if he dies?

44:04.642 --> 44:06.809
I mean, shit, man.

44:08.746 --> 44:12.915
With Charlie gone,
everything changes.

44:15.386 --> 44:20.356
No, everything's
already changed.

44:33.437 --> 44:35.238
I'm taking it to Charlie.

45:09.073 --> 45:10.840
I have an idea.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.479
Cody.

45:18.449 --> 45:19.449
Yeah, boss.

45:24.421 --> 45:27.490
Cody, Cody, Cody.

45:28.258 --> 45:30.126
Listen, man.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.228
We gotta work together, okay?

45:32.230 --> 45:36.199
Sure, boss.

45:36.201 --> 45:40.036
Now, Dutch...

45:40.038 --> 45:44.974
My understanding is we got a bit
of a situation out there, right?

45:44.976 --> 45:46.776
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well okay.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.478
Now listen to priority.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.480
It's gotta be...

45:50.482 --> 45:53.182
To get the car going, okay?

45:53.184 --> 45:55.952
So okay, fix the car.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.328
Where the hell are we?

46:05.330 --> 46:09.132
Charlie, don't-don't
strain yourself.

46:10.234 --> 46:11.367
Alright, you know what?

46:11.369 --> 46:13.770
You guys gotta get out of here.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.040
You gotta just get out of here.

46:21.146 --> 46:23.146
I'll hang out here
with the kids.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.522
Hey, Dutch.

46:32.524 --> 46:36.259
You got anything to
sweeten this like um...

46:36.261 --> 46:38.361
A kind of music or something?

46:38.363 --> 46:40.429
I-i-i don't know.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.131
I got the... yeah.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.301
I got the thing.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.336
It can put the tunes on, right?

46:47.338 --> 46:49.338
What are you doing?
You got a new phone?

46:49.340 --> 46:51.240
Look at you. Ha!

46:52.910 --> 46:53.943
Let me find something.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.311
I don't think that's gonna work.

46:58.348 --> 47:00.283
That's nice, but you know what?

47:00.285 --> 47:02.018
Let's get...

47:02.020 --> 47:04.821
Cody, open the curtain.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.122
Oh.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.063
Oh yeah.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.966
That's better.

47:16.968 --> 47:20.303
Charlie, you ready?

47:21.305 --> 47:22.872
Alright, let's do it.

47:23.106 --> 47:27.109
Get that fucking
thing out of me.

47:31.115 --> 47:32.315
Okay.

47:32.317 --> 47:33.950
Ah!

47:34.853 --> 47:35.852
Alright, Charlie.

47:35.854 --> 47:36.586
What the fuck!

47:36.588 --> 47:38.287
Go ahead, go ahead.

47:48.498 --> 47:49.465
Alright, Charlie.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.533
Come on.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.501
Will you hurry the fuck up?

47:52.503 --> 47:52.501
Alright, man.

47:52.503 --> 47:55.504
- Woo!
- We're gonna beat this.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.374
Get it out! What the...

47:58.376 --> 48:00.977
Stay still.
Stay still now.

48:01.445 --> 48:01.444
That's it.

48:01.446 --> 48:03.646
Alright, alright.

48:04.982 --> 48:06.215
Look out!

48:06.217 --> 48:07.217
Alright.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.198
I got it, I got it.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.232
I got the bullet.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.567
I got the bullet, Charlie.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.669
I just...

48:26.671 --> 48:28.237
Just rest now.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.372
You're alright.

48:31.074 --> 48:34.677
I'm gonna have to do...

48:34.679 --> 48:36.412
I gotta burn them, Cody.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.547
I'm gonna burn it shut.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.017
Sorry, Charlie.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.251
Alright, man.

48:47.425 --> 48:48.958
Okay.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.259
Okay.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.526
Can I make a suggestion?

49:59.730 --> 50:01.731
What is it?

50:01.733 --> 50:03.766
Well...

50:03.768 --> 50:07.169
I work at a body shop
not far from here.

50:09.306 --> 50:15.378
I can maybe take a look at
your car and see what's wrong.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.680
What are you getting at?

50:17.682 --> 50:20.583
Well, ash and I can go get
the part you need from my

50:20.585 --> 50:23.686
shop and install it for
you and get some medical

50:23.688 --> 50:25.087
supplies, too.

50:25.089 --> 50:26.389
Whatever you need.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.727
It could work, Cody.

50:34.264 --> 50:36.132
No medical supplies. I don't
want you gone that long.

50:36.134 --> 50:38.334
We fix the car.

50:39.169 --> 50:40.636
And only one of you goes.

50:40.638 --> 50:41.504
You.

50:41.506 --> 50:43.506
Your buddy stays.

50:48.812 --> 50:50.780
What are you waiting for?

51:25.449 --> 51:27.083
'72 dodge dart.

51:28.318 --> 51:30.119
'74.

51:30.654 --> 51:32.588
Can I take a look?

51:32.590 --> 51:34.190
Go ahead.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.841
Can I go inside?

52:00.350 --> 52:01.417
There's a gun in there.

52:01.419 --> 52:03.285
You should probably take it.

52:16.533 --> 52:19.568
You punctured a heating hose.

52:19.570 --> 52:21.337
You would've been able to
drive for about two hours

52:21.339 --> 52:23.772
before your radiator overheated.

52:23.774 --> 52:25.307
Uh huh.

52:26.176 --> 52:29.745
So I'll get you a new
hose and two clamps.

52:29.747 --> 52:30.846
It's an easy fix.

52:30.848 --> 52:32.581
You got a half hour.

52:32.583 --> 52:35.684
- I'm gonna need more time.
- Time starts now.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.154
Can I let ash know I'm going?

52:38.156 --> 52:39.522
No.

52:40.490 --> 52:42.558
You're wasting time, go on.

52:54.271 --> 52:56.772
What you mean like first
grade, kindergarten?

52:59.710 --> 53:01.844
Yeah, I had a buddy like
that one time.

53:05.515 --> 53:07.783
How's it going?

53:07.785 --> 53:10.252
Having a nice chat?

53:10.254 --> 53:12.221
Getting to know each other.

53:14.925 --> 53:16.792
Look what I found.

53:16.794 --> 53:19.228
In the front seat.

53:19.230 --> 53:21.430
Can you fucking imagine?

53:24.801 --> 53:26.869
You're becoming a liability.

53:28.638 --> 53:31.840
One too many fuck ups.

54:07.712 --> 54:09.712
Hey, Connor.

54:09.714 --> 54:10.913
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

54:10.915 --> 54:12.615
Teen angst.

54:12.617 --> 54:15.284
Don't worry, that
never goes away, kid.

54:35.338 --> 54:36.472
Yo, is that Connor?

54:36.474 --> 54:38.407
I think, yeah.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.475
What's he doing?

54:39.477 --> 54:40.909
I don't know.

54:40.911 --> 54:41.844
Wait, Connor.

54:41.846 --> 54:42.978
- Connor.
- Hey.

54:42.980 --> 54:43.946
Yo.

54:43.948 --> 54:45.614
Jesus.

54:47.017 --> 54:49.818
Um, is he okay?

54:49.820 --> 54:51.420
I don't know.

54:51.422 --> 54:52.988
- He doesn't really run.
- I mean...

54:54.058 --> 54:55.057
He'll probably be fine.

54:55.059 --> 54:57.059
Yeah, totally.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.868
Connor, what are you doing?

56:12.870 --> 56:14.603
Richie, you're probably
wondering why I'm here.

56:14.605 --> 56:17.439
Yeah, I mean, it
is your day off.

56:17.441 --> 56:18.807
Well, let me explain.

56:18.809 --> 56:21.510
Uh, you know Mr.
Cooper, copper?

56:21.512 --> 56:21.510
I can never remember.

56:21.512 --> 56:25.047
- Cooper with the '74 Pontiac?
- Right.

56:25.049 --> 56:29.451
Um he was pulled over on 28 with
his hood open and everything.

56:29.453 --> 56:30.986
Are you okay?

56:30.988 --> 56:32.020
Yeah, I'm fine.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.655
Anyway, so you know.

56:33.657 --> 56:35.090
Heater hose punctured somehow.

56:35.092 --> 56:35.090
I thought I'd help him out.

56:35.092 --> 56:39.595
And I told him to contact
you about payment.

56:39.597 --> 56:41.063
And I didn't wanna bother
you because I know you

56:41.065 --> 56:43.465
weren't expecting me today so.

56:43.467 --> 56:44.933
You alright?

56:44.935 --> 56:47.803
Yeah, I'm fine. I just ran from
all the way over there so.

56:47.805 --> 56:48.871
Okay, okay, sure.

56:48.873 --> 56:49.838
You can do that.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.508
- No problem. Uh...
- Okay.

56:52.510 --> 56:53.675
Those are the wrong clamps.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.043
Hold on.

57:05.188 --> 57:06.955
One. These are the
right clamps.

57:06.957 --> 57:10.592
Take those and uh,
take the cutters.

57:10.594 --> 57:11.693
And uh...

57:11.695 --> 57:11.693
Okay, thank you.

57:11.695 --> 57:11.693
Alright, we'll see you later.

57:11.695 --> 57:17.499
Hey, weren't you supposed to
clean jt's trailer today?

57:18.568 --> 57:19.735
Yeah, we finished.

57:19.737 --> 57:21.036
We finished that.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.905
That was pretty quick.

57:22.907 --> 57:25.174
Yeah. Uh...

57:25.176 --> 57:26.742
Gotta go.

57:30.180 --> 57:32.047
See you later, kid.

57:48.532 --> 57:49.498
Oh!

57:49.500 --> 57:51.099
Oh, this is great.

57:51.101 --> 57:52.835
So this is what uh...

57:52.837 --> 57:54.770
This is what kids are
doing these days?

57:54.772 --> 57:57.639
I mean, this is like
seriously dangerous.

57:57.641 --> 58:00.209
Well, you wear lots of
body armor and a helmet.

58:00.211 --> 58:02.077
A helmet?

58:02.079 --> 58:03.979
Yeah, like a mask.

58:04.981 --> 58:08.183
I don't wear armor, but
i just wear a hoodie.

58:08.185 --> 58:11.019
Does that make you cool?

58:11.021 --> 58:13.055
Well no, that's just how I play.

58:13.057 --> 58:17.192
Oh. And how does
one play exactly?

58:18.127 --> 58:20.529
Well, there's a bunch of
different kinds of games.

58:20.531 --> 58:25.734
Capture the flag, team-on-team,
last man standing.

58:25.736 --> 58:27.236
What's that one?

58:27.238 --> 58:28.570
Last man standing?

58:28.572 --> 58:29.838
Yeah.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.774
Well, it's kind of like
what it sounds like.

58:32.776 --> 58:35.244
Shoot everybody
until nobody's left.

58:35.246 --> 58:36.778
Nobody?

58:36.780 --> 58:38.580
What about the last man?

58:38.582 --> 58:42.618
Well, it's called that, but
everybody always gets shot.

58:43.253 --> 58:44.987
Huh.

58:51.762 --> 58:54.196
In the neck, in the neck.

59:04.942 --> 59:06.742
Everybody get your
raffle tickets.

59:06.744 --> 59:10.012
Please get your raffle
tickets before we announce

59:10.014 --> 59:11.146
the raffle number.

59:11.148 --> 59:12.814
Thank you.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:57.479
My father liked to fish,
you know?

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:59.147
He was uh...

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:02.184
Had like a lodge
i guess you'd say.

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:04.286
It was up in Massachusetts.

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:06.922
And uh, it wasn't
much, you know.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:11.226
But he'd go up there and I'd go
up on the weekends sometimes.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:15.063
My mom would go to Jersey
with her girlfriends.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.766
I'd go up there
and he'd be uh...

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:19.968
You know, he liked to drink,
too, don't get me wrong.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:24.005
But when he wasn't
drinking, we'd go out and

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.875
take the boat and...

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:26.875
You know.

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:30.112
Some of my happiest
memories, you know?

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:34.449
Just-just-just drifting
along with him.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:37.953
We'd catch sunnies, you know.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.387
Throw them back.

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.393
What's your father like?

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.972
Time's up.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.311
How well do you know this kid?

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:04.212
Cody, come on.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.214
Give him a chance.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.883
I don't think I will.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:08.950
Whoa! What are you doing?

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:08.950
Come on!

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.385
I'm gonna knock his fucking...

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:11.353
Come on, no!

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.854
Come on, come on!

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:13.955
Cody, relax!

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.490
Cody, stop.
Now stop!

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:18.794
- Get off of me!
- Hey, hey!

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:19.461
He didn't do anything!

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:19.461
Fucking let go of me!

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:19.461
The kid didn't do a thing.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:22.931
I don't fucking care
if he did anything.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:25.033
Where's your fucking
friend and his fucking...

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.301
Relax!

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.073
You're late.

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:35.944
Connor.

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:37.345
What took you so long?

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.117
Sit-sit-sit down.

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:43.018
It's okay.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.319
It's okay.

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.179
Anybody follow you?

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:44.179
No.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:47.382
You sure you got
everything you need?

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.084
I'm positive.

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.995
Jack?

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.280
Dad?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.282
How does he know your name?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.690
Let's discuss this.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.462
Let's talk in there.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:44.285
No one knows we're here.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.821
I just wanna get those
boys out of here.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.790
What is he doing?

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:52.327
No one will intrude
unless I want them to.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:57.564
Jack, that boy is your son?

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.135
Yes, ash is my son.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.638
He's a good kid.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.673
Reminds me of you.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.844
Now listen to me.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.845
You're safe here.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.381
Now here's what i can offer.

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:17.417
Ash will take my car into
town and get you whatever

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.620
supplies you need.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:21.288
Medical, food, you name it.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:24.658
Meanwhile, Connor will
make the necessary repairs

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:28.363
to your car under your
supervision and I'll

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.598
remain here with you.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:36.938
Look, I'm sorry it
had to be this way.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.907
I know you.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:42.277
I'm no better man than
either one of you.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.546
I only took a better path
because that is what was

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:45.913
offered to me.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.654
I know you didn't have
that chance, Dutch.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.294
We understand.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:04.866
Alright.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.606
Alright, here's the plan.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.875
- We're gonna take the...
- Your boy stays here.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.310
I'm sorry?

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:16.477
Ash.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:17.445
He stays here.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.581
You go to town.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.217
Okay.

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.454
And that car runs perfectly.

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:29.958
Connor, is that possible?

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.429
We'll tie you up after.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:44.806
Hey.

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.378
Thank you.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.060
Now what you're gonna do...

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.589
Cody!

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:53.708
Cody!

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.718
I'm coming in now, Cody.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.414
Your next, Cody.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:35.550
Shoot the fucker!

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.385
He's just gonna shoot back.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.886
Unless you give me what I want.

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:46.527
I got a tip from an old
friend of yours, Cody.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.431
Can't trust them all I guess.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.576
Fuck!

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:04.812
Charlie!

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.189
Bad idea, friend.

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:51.893
Cody!

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.677
I got your boss.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:13.815
Poor Dutch.

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:20.488
Dad!

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:21.622
Ready?

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.133
He didn't put up
much of a fight.

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:34.969
Dad, hey!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.637
What are you doing?

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.074
Dad, come on.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:41.843
What are you still doing here?

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:42.743
Go.

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:44.212
Please!

01:14:44.214 --> 01:14:45.813
Hey!

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.248
Take this.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.250
Are you sure?

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:51.152
Better you should
have it than him.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.979
This is too easy.

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:44.672
Ah!

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:45.873
Ash, get up.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:23.711
Ash!

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:26.681
Move!

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.818
Run!
