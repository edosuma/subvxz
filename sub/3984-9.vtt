WEBVTT

02:34.560 --> 02:37.848
- Look out!
- Fire!

03:03.040 --> 03:05.725
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.041
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.284
Burned our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.522
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.841
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.720
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

03:20.800 --> 03:23.041
The Northerners know more about their land
than we ever will.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.451
Put last night's guards in chains.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.682
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.207
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.602
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward to Winterfell

03:33.680 --> 03:36.126
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.964
We're not returning to Castle Black.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.408
Forgive me, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

03:41.480 --> 03:45.121
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

03:58.400 --> 04:00.880
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.250
Halt!

04:44.080 --> 04:46.686
Halt!

04:49.520 --> 04:51.363
There it is!

05:31.800 --> 05:33.882
Open the gates.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.762
It was a failure.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.365
It wasn't.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.767
I went to save them. I failed.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.045
You didn't fail him.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.121
Or him.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.807
Or her.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.527
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.281
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.886
You have a good heart.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.047
It'll get us all killed.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.164
Get out of my way.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.930
You sent for me?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.128
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.401
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.322
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

07:54.400 --> 07:56.971
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.684
In return, when I take the throne,

07:58.760 --> 08:01.525
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.922
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall
if he so wishes.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.250
You named me your Hand.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.846
Yes.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.763
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

08:13.840 --> 08:15.171
especially in time of war.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.242
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.561
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.211
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

08:22.280 --> 08:23.884
what does the boy say?

08:23.960 --> 08:26.440
I didn't name you Hand
for your expertize in military matters.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.649
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.726
Perhaps Queen Selyse
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.164
My family stays with me.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.121
At least let me take Shireen.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.568
A siege is no place for a little girl.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.961
My family stays with me.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.367
What's this one now?

09:26.440 --> 09:30.240
A True Telling
by Grand Maester Munkun.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.684
Now that sounds like a proper story.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.451
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.841
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.248
And he crouched behind it and crept forward,

09:41.320 --> 09:43.368
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.523
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.205
And burned him to a crisp.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.166
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of Ser Byron Swann.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.282
I made you something.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.043
- Do you like it?
- He's beautiful.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.922
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.446
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

10:14.520 --> 10:16.204
Of course I will.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.251
But why am I getting a present?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.729
Because you deserve it.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.966
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.168
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.970
Made it this far without reading.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.407
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.722
Wish I'd listened to him.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.488
This is my own poor way
of saying "thank you."

10:47.240 --> 10:49.288
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.402
I'll be gone for a few days.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.527
I want to hear all about
The Dance of Dragons when I'm back.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.728
You'll read it yourself.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.771
Prince Doran.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.286
Forgive us. We started without you.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.169
Please, sit.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.724
Princess Myrcella.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.401
Uncle.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.250
What a lovely dress.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.446
You don't like it?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.170
- You must be cold.
- Not at all.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.126
The Dornish climate agrees with me.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.001
Prince Trystane.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.281
How's your jaw?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.165
A fleabite.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.924
What are you doing in Dorne?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.207
Looking after the safety of my niece.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.489
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

11:57.560 --> 11:59.483
you decided to enter my country in secret

11:59.840 --> 12:01.729
and abduct our guest by force?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.087
We received a threatening message.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.001
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.362
That necklace was stolen from my room.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.290
Oh, excellent.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.362
A last meal before the beheading?

12:22.440 --> 12:24.090
Oh, I can't behead you.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.401
Many in Dorne want war.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.767
But I've seen war.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.650
I've seen the bodies piled
on the battlefields.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.849
I've seen the orphans starving
in the cities.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.922
I don't want to lead my
people into that hell.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.765
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.003
And that is precisely what we are doing.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.721
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

12:47.800 --> 12:49.689
King of the Andals and the First Men,

12:50.120 --> 12:51.485
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.050
King Tommen insists
on his sister's return to the capital?

13:16.160 --> 13:17.446
I'm afraid he does.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.443
I cannot disobey my king's command.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.120
She will return with you to King's Landing.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.528
And my son, Prince Trystane,
will accompany you both.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.321
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

13:32.400 --> 13:33.845
their engagement must stand.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.881
I accept.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.361
One more thing.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.445
My brother was named to the Small Council
before his death.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.320
Your father understood the importance
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.447
With Oberyn gone,

13:46.520 --> 13:49.808
Trystane will take his place
on the Small Council.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.041
You have my word.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.407
The word of a Kingslayer.

13:54.960 --> 13:59.045
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

14:00.440 --> 14:04.081
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.970
For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.441
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.961
May I inquire as to the fate
of my man Bronn?

14:21.040 --> 14:24.089
Tell me, in King's Landing,

14:24.160 --> 14:27.323
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.970
He said it was just a fleabite.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.840
The fault is mine.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.446
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.962
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.964
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.724
I'll let him decide.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.405
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.643
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.448
On one condition.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.601
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.001
I'll always be better than you.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.890
Have I ever missed once?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.088
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.807
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.041
Which do you love most?

15:23.480 --> 15:24.891
That one hurt, didn't it?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.088
You going to cry?

15:28.160 --> 15:29.924
Give up, little sister.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.241
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.607
You will. You're thinking too much.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.529
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

15:42.000 --> 15:43.001
Luck.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.771
Now it's my turn.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.202
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.882
Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.883
You'll find out very soon.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.684
Say it one more time, handsome.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.091
Who am I?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.166
The most beautiful woman in the world.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.605
And that's the truth.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.843
Slut.

16:23.520 --> 16:28.082
Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.766
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.280
Only the one.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.840
I believe you've already met
Prince Trystane.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.250
Prince.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.011
Sorry about the other day.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.526
Prince Trystane here
is a man of mercy.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.080
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.442
I'm glad to hear it.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.361
Pie looks good.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.920
There was one condition.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.646
Perhaps some soup instead.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.770
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.723
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.722
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.848
Oysters, clams, and...

17:20.920 --> 17:23.651
How much for your little clam?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.971
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.850
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.768
Come on.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.888
Some oysters, girl!

18:14.840 --> 18:17.081
I'm talking to you.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.006
Is, uh...

18:22.360 --> 18:23.521
- Girl!
- Tie her up!

18:23.960 --> 18:26.645
Are you deaf? Girl!

18:28.160 --> 18:29.685
Girl!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.490
My lord.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.203
SAILOR; My lord.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.805
Lord Tyrell.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.609
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

18:45.680 --> 18:49.366
may I be the first to welcome you
to the Free City of Braavos.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.209
I hope your journey was trouble-free.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.966
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.805
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.042
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

19:00.200 --> 19:05.843
Ah, the vintners say this might be the best
year for red grapes in half a century.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.605
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

19:08.680 --> 19:13.641
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.291
I'm afraid I don't partake.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.601
Oh.

19:23.560 --> 19:28.122
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.850
Pure nonsense, of course.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.002
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

19:32.080 --> 19:37.211
Did you know that at one point Maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

19:37.320 --> 19:39.687
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

19:39.760 --> 19:42.127
and cut off both their hands.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.368
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.442
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

19:46.760 --> 19:50.162
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

19:50.240 --> 19:54.404
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.927
We are not gamblers
here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.367
You are the world's best gamblers.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.206
And all those bets you won built this.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.046
We should celebrate.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.691
I'm afraid I still
have a good deal of work to do.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.286
- Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
- I don't have that gift.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.727
It's not a gift. It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.210
So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

20:29.280 --> 20:33.251
And give me two kisses in Salty Town

20:33.320 --> 20:37.291
For we're going to die tomorrow

20:38.320 --> 20:41.642
The bareheaded beggar
The king with his crown...

20:41.760 --> 20:43.842
Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.084
Wasn't bad, though.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.640
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.210
Treasonous cunts.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.090
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.288
This is the place, lads.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.971
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.611
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.648
But I never was good at sharing.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.848
Sell your fish somewhere else.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.730
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.681
Come here, sweetness.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.651
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.367
We'll take half a dozen.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.649
Three coppers.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.968
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.086
Too old.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.841
Brea.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.566
Too old.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.128
I have just the one. Anara.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.564
Our most expensive girl.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.810
But well worth it, I assure you.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.609
Too old.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.410
Do you have what I want or not?

23:07.880 --> 23:11.168
Of course. Of course.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.605
These fresh?

23:22.600 --> 23:25.331
Come on, the lads are hungry.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.129
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.130
- Here. Thank you.
- I'll have one.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.164
Any vinegar?

23:39.320 --> 23:41.049
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

24:02.200 --> 24:03.964
Good.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.130
I'll tell you when we're done.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.883
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

24:23.640 --> 24:25.165
Of course.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.530
I'll have you whipped, girl.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.841
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.725
Valar Morghulis.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.571
And?

25:06.640 --> 25:09.325
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.528
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.726
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.522
A girl has work to do.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.128
Your rebellion is over.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.162
You can swear your allegiance to me now,

25:40.880 --> 25:42.609
or you can die.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.081
I believe in second chances.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.811
I don't believe in third chances.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.208
You write like a seven-year-old.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.011
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.321
- He didn't try to make you pay?
- Mmm-mmm.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.568
Maybe he's changed.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.130
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.201
She will.

27:09.640 --> 27:13.611
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Of course, she's my niece.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.004
I wasn't talking about her.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.202
You think I disapprove?

27:20.280 --> 27:21.327
Why?

27:21.880 --> 27:24.804
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

27:24.880 --> 27:28.009
They disapproved of Oberyn and me
where you are from.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.641
Here, no one blinked an eye.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.931
100 years ago,
no one would have blinked an eye at you

27:37.000 --> 27:38.604
if you'd been named Targaryen.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.801
It's always changing,

27:41.880 --> 27:44.770
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.010
The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.002
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

28:03.080 --> 28:05.162
that happened to the man I love.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.361
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.803
Father.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.606
Aren't you cold?

28:38.160 --> 28:40.003
No. What are you reading?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.565
The Dance of Dragons.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.880
What's it about?

28:43.960 --> 28:45.246
It's the story of the fight

28:45.320 --> 28:47.322
between Rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brother Aegon

28:47.400 --> 28:49.607
for control of the Seven Kingdoms.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.490
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.731
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.848
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.322
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

29:03.080 --> 29:07.085
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.925
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.721
They never truly recovered.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.848
The Dance of Dragons.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.762
Why is that a dance?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.683
It's just what they call it.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.364
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.329
I think it's poetic.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.851
If you'd had to choose

29:33.920 --> 29:37.083
between Rhaenyra and Aegon,

29:38.960 --> 29:40.246
who would you have chosen?

29:40.680 --> 29:43.286
I wouldn't have chosen either.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.966
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.281
Sometimes a person has to choose.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.643
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.490
If a man knows what he is

29:59.920 --> 30:02.730
and remains true to himself,

30:06.240 --> 30:08.447
the choice is no choice at all.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.480
He must fulfill his destiny

30:13.760 --> 30:17.162
and become who he is meant to be.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.722
However much he may hate it.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.969
It's all right.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.845
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.844
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.450
Is there any way I can help?

30:42.560 --> 30:43.800
Yes, there is.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.605
Good. I want to.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.767
I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.922
And I'm your daughter.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.203
Forgive me.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.847
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.890
It will all be over soon.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.161
No.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.088
Where's my father?

32:06.160 --> 32:08.640
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

32:08.720 --> 32:11.087
Please, let me see my father.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.050
Father, where are you?
Don't let her do this.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.407
Please let go!

32:17.960 --> 32:21.169
Let me see my father! Where are you? Please!

32:22.080 --> 32:23.525
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.725
- Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.842
- A great thing.
- Stop!

32:28.920 --> 32:30.968
- Please!
- Hear us now, my Lord.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.725
- You can't do this!
- For you, we offer up this girl...

32:33.800 --> 32:36.201
- Please!
- ...that you may cleanse her with your fire

32:36.280 --> 32:38.248
and that its light may lead our way.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.402
No, please let me see my father.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.285
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.
All of us.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.204
But if we make this sacrifice...

32:46.280 --> 32:51.411
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.642
Lord of Light, show us the way.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.563
Mother, please!

32:58.560 --> 33:00.130
Mother, please!

33:00.200 --> 33:01.850
- Mother!
- We can't.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.287
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

33:04.360 --> 33:06.283
- Please don't!
- Lord of Light, protect us.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.285
- Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.884
Father, don't do this! Please!

33:13.960 --> 33:17.328
Mother, no! Please, help!

33:17.400 --> 33:19.767
Don't do this!

33:19.840 --> 33:22.571
Please, Father! Mother, help!

33:22.640 --> 33:25.723
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

33:25.800 --> 33:29.168
Don't do this, please, Mother!

33:29.240 --> 33:33.086
Please, Mother! Help!

33:33.160 --> 33:35.049
Mother, help!

33:36.240 --> 33:39.801
Please don't do this, Mother!

33:39.880 --> 33:42.042
Please, Mother!

33:42.120 --> 33:47.206
Please! No!

34:05.200 --> 34:08.123
No!

34:57.680 --> 34:59.284
Where have you been?

34:59.360 --> 35:01.567
Just making sure everything is in order.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.051
Free Citizens of Meereen!

35:25.880 --> 35:29.327
By the blessings of the Graces,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.121
and her majesty the Queen,

35:32.720 --> 35:33.960
welcome

35:34.200 --> 35:36.487
to the Great Games!

35:56.040 --> 35:58.611
My Queen, our first contest.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.527
Who will triumph:

36:01.840 --> 36:03.410
the strong,

36:03.520 --> 36:05.284
or the quick?

36:07.600 --> 36:11.082
I fight and die for your glory,

36:11.680 --> 36:13.842
oh glorious Queen.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.729
I fight and die for your glory,

36:18.960 --> 36:20.883
oh glorious Queen.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.281
They're waiting for you.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.770
Clap your hands.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.891
That one, the smaller man.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.530
No question,
that's where you should put your money.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.886
The smaller man it is.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.849
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.082
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.640
Perhaps you should
go find someone who does.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.566
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.405
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.403
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.963
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.884
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.610
You yourself?

37:34.680 --> 37:37.445
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

37:39.760 --> 37:42.604
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

37:42.680 --> 37:45.331
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

37:45.400 --> 37:48.370
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.727
They couldn't get
their money out fast enough.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.247
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

37:54.320 --> 37:56.766
or here.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.449
And the big men were always too slow

37:59.520 --> 38:02.330
to stop my dagger
from going where their muscles weren't.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.166
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

38:06.240 --> 38:10.404
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.889
You don't approve?

38:23.960 --> 38:26.930
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.970
- I can do without it in my leisure time.
- Fair enough.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.610
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

38:31.680 --> 38:35.810
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

38:35.880 --> 38:39.282
It's easy to confuse
what is with what ought to be,

38:39.360 --> 38:42.204
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.850
I'm not talking about myself.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.241
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.448
That is greatness?

38:48.520 --> 38:52.764
That is a vital part
of the great city of Meereen,

38:52.840 --> 38:54.763
which existed long before you or I

38:54.840 --> 38:59.084
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.083
My father would have liked you.

39:09.600 --> 39:13.002
Who will triumph?

39:13.120 --> 39:15.521
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.728
- At your command?
- If need be.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.651
A Meereenese champion?

39:24.120 --> 39:26.521
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

39:26.600 --> 39:29.729
If it comes to that,
they will have died for a good reason.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.928
Those men think
they're dying for a good reason.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.650
Someone else's reason.

39:33.720 --> 39:36.326
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

39:36.400 --> 39:38.289
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.970
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.804
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.327
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.968
Or a Westerosi knight?

39:51.240 --> 39:53.481
I fight and die for your glory,

39:55.920 --> 39:58.890
oh glorious Queen.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.806
- Your Grace...
- Shut your mouth.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.282
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.044
You can.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.966
Protect your queen!

44:39.600 --> 44:41.284
Go!

45:05.840 --> 45:07.410
Your Grace!

45:07.480 --> 45:10.051
Come with me. I know a way out.
I know a way...

45:46.000 --> 45:47.161
Stay close.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.005
This way.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.201
The other side. Follow me.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.122
Protect your queen!

49:09.120 --> 49:10.849
Drogon!

50:13.120 --> 50:14.246
Valahd.
