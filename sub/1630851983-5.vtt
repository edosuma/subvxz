00:21.230 --> 00:23.774
All right, there's ice on Mars,

00:23.857 --> 00:27.945
which means there's lots of potential
for evidence of past life on Mars.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.406
So, there's plenty of data
for NASA to keep testing.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.909
But we shouldn't just look in one spot.

00:33.992 --> 00:38.539
That's true. The solar system
is a vast and wondrous place.

00:38.622 --> 00:42.292
If Mars has potential,
perhaps other spots do too.

00:42.376 --> 00:46.797
Great work, everyone. All this talk
of ice sure is making me thirsty.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.716
So where should we look next?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.093
Thanks, big brother.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.350
Well, we all know life needs water.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.563
So if we wanna find life, we should
explore a place that has lots of water.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.358
A place with lots of water
sure sounds nice right about now.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.736
And I have just the place: Europa.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.699
It's pronounced "Europe."

01:14.199 --> 01:17.911
No, sir.
Europa is one of Jupiter's 79 moons.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.582
And according to these images,
it looks very promising.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.417
It's covered in ice.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.589
We already explored a planet with ice,
and we didn't find any aliens.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.091
Yes. But as we learned on Mars,

01:31.175 --> 01:34.553
wherever there's ice,
there could also be liquid water.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.598
If we search Europa,
who knows what we'll find.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.600
<i>Did you say Europa?</i>

01:39.683 --> 01:41.101
<i>Wonderful choice.</i>

01:41.685 --> 01:46.148
<i>NASA is very interested in Europa
as a potential place to find life</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:50.402
<i>because our probes suggest
there might be an ocean there!</i>

02:18.805 --> 02:21.683
Could we use the probes
to help us explore Europa?

02:21.767 --> 02:26.021
<i>Well, we'd need someone
who's very skilled at operating robots.</i>

02:27.272 --> 02:30.817
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

02:30.901 --> 02:35.572
We'll be arriving at Europa shortly.
So sit back and enjoy the flight.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.535
<i>Okay then. Happy hunting.</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:26.748
How's our search going? Any updates?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.168
The good news is we found ice.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.421
Lots and lots and lots of ice.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.757
The bad news is no ocean.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.635
I don't know why you're surprised.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.181
The further away a planet is from the sun,
the colder it is.

03:42.264 --> 03:46.894
And the colder it is, the less likely
you are to find liquid water. Just ice.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.980
Let's keep searching.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.234
CARA said they have evidence of an ocean.
It's got to be here somewhere.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.029
Well, we finished looking over the whole
moon. Should we do another sweep?

04:39.112 --> 04:44.701
Like I said, we are never going to find
anything on this snowball. Just ice.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.454
Wait. I think I found something.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.373
Hey. I see it too.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.625
Marcie, can you enhance the image?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.709
On it, sir.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.755
A geyser!

04:57.339 --> 04:58.674
That's liquid water.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.175
Do you know what this means?
Do you know what this means?

05:00.259 --> 05:05.222
The ocean we've been looking for isn't
on the surface. It's underneath the ice.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.880
Wow. An ocean inside a moon?

05:37.963 --> 05:41.967
Just where I thought it would be.
But Europa's so far from the sun.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.969
Why isn't the water frozen?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.053
<i>I can answer that!</i>

05:45.137 --> 05:48.640
<i>The gravitational pull
from Jupiter's orbit is so strong,</i>

05:48.724 --> 05:51.101
<i>it creates waves like ocean tides.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:56.815
<i>The energy from those waves keep Europa's
water warm and liquid under its icy shell.</i>

05:56.899 --> 05:58.525
<i>We're not sure yet,</i>

05:58.609 --> 06:04.156
<i>but we also think that tidal energy
might also produce hydrothermal vents!</i>
<i>but we also think that tidal energy

06:04.239 --> 06:08.243
Hydrothermal events? That sounds fancy.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.454
<i>No, Sally, vents.</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:13.040
<i>They're like geysers
but on the ocean floor.</i>

06:13.123 --> 06:14.875
<i>They release jets of warm water</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:18.420
<i>that might be filled with
organic molecules from the rocks below.</i>

06:19.004 --> 06:22.257
<i>The exact minerals
that form the building blocks of life.</i>

06:23.759 --> 06:27.513
So, Europa has water, energy
and organic material.

06:27.596 --> 06:33.185
<i>And it's possible it might have another
important component for life: time.</i>

06:33.685 --> 06:37.773
<i>Having water, energy
and organics is a good start,</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:41.527
<i>but it takes a long time
for life to grow and evolve.</i>

06:41.610 --> 06:45.405
<i>We think Europa's ocean
has existed for billions of years.</i>

06:45.489 --> 06:47.741
<i>So, anything could be in there,</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:51.703
<i>from single-celled organisms
to giant sea creatures.</i>

06:51.787 --> 06:56.750
<i>Perhaps it won't be much longer
until we have the technology to find out.</i>

06:56.834 --> 07:00.963
Think of the possibilities.
Like space sharks.
Think of the possibilities.
Like space sharks.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.758
I'm not sure I'm ready
to think about space sharks.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.292
I'll go get a mop.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.213
An ocean in a moon.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.758
And another amazing clue
in our search for life.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.432
Why can't I have a normal dog?
