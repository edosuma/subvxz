00:07.000 --> 00:09.330
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.540
Hey, Mom,
you were right.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.960
Letting me paint
on this extra vest

00:13.960 --> 00:15.710
was a good way of keeping me
quiet while you work.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.420
Yeah, and it lasted
a whole 45 seconds.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.500
So, what do you think?

00:21.500 --> 00:23.330
Wow!

00:23.330 --> 00:25.580
What is it?

00:25.580 --> 00:27.880
It's a plunger
wearing a top hat.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.540
I knew that.
I knew that, honey.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.540
I love it, I really do,
and not just 'cause
I'm your mama

00:31.540 --> 00:33.500
and I love everything you do.
It's beautiful.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.040
So, are you almost done?

00:37.040 --> 00:38.500
You've been working
so much lately.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.120
I know, sweetheart. But, listen.
Paisley's show is tomorrow,

00:42.120 --> 00:44.420
and I really have to make sure
she likes my design.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.420
Doggy Fashion Week
is a big deal for me.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.000
Which is sad, and we're
not gonna get into why.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.670
So, uh,
what can I do to help?

00:52.670 --> 00:55.210
-Okay. All right.
Here we go.
-Okay.

00:55.210 --> 00:58.500
Take this jacket, put it on,
and model it for me, sweetie.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.880
Okay. All right.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.580
How's this look?

01:05.580 --> 01:08.420
Like you're selling
cassette tapes out
the back of your car.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.750
Then, how about something
a little more casual?

01:12.750 --> 01:13.960
Yeah, do that.

01:16.750 --> 01:20.250
Why yes, my mommy did take me
back-to-school shopping.

01:21.460 --> 01:25.330
Booker, just put the jacket on,
stand still and pose.

01:25.330 --> 01:28.540
I got to copy what's
on the back of that jacket
to the back of this doggie vest.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.830
Wait. You're painting
the design?

01:29.830 --> 01:31.380
I thought
you were painting me.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.960
Who would want a portrait of you
on the back of their vest?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.580
-Grandma.
-Ooh, you're right.
Remember that for Christmas.

(laughter)

02:32.210 --> 02:33.920
(phone rings)

02:35.040 --> 02:36.670
Hello?

02:36.670 --> 02:38.670
I'm sorry, this isn't
Pete's Pizza.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.290
No, you can't place
a to-go order.

02:44.670 --> 02:47.080
Because this isn't Pete's Pizza!

02:48.670 --> 02:51.040
That's like
the fifth call today.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.000
That pizza place must've
printed our phone number

02:53.000 --> 02:54.460
on their fliers by mistake.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.420
Rae, listen. You're not
gonna believe this,

02:56.420 --> 02:58.830
but our heating bill
is like $300.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.460
Three hundred dollars?
What did we heat up, Chicago?

03:01.460 --> 03:03.460
(laughs)

03:03.460 --> 03:05.540
Listen. I have to go to work.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.830
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets cold,

03:07.830 --> 03:09.330
put on a sweater!

03:10.830 --> 03:13.250
-Bye, Mom, have a good day.
-Thanks, sweetie.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.750
Raven, you're fired!

03:21.880 --> 03:23.580
Both (gasping):
Oh, no!

03:24.620 --> 03:26.080
Why'd you say "Oh, no"?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.420
I didn't say "Oh, no,"
you did.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.830
No, I... No, I didn't.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.960
Well, then it looks like
neither of us said "Oh, no."

03:30.960 --> 03:32.210
Guess it's all good.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.620
-It's all good,
it's all good.
-Yeah.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.080
-I'm gonna go talk to Chelsea.
-I'm gonna go talk to Levi.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.460
Chels, you're not gonna
believe this.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.290
-I just had a vision I got...
-...fired!

03:41.290 --> 03:42.580
How does
your mom get fired?

03:42.580 --> 03:44.000
I don't know, but

03:44.000 --> 03:45.670
I think it's gonna happen
at that fashion show.

03:45.670 --> 03:48.830
-But that's tomorrow.
-I know, that's why I need
Paisley to love my designs.

03:48.830 --> 03:51.040
-I can't have my...
-...vision come true.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.710
I have to do something!

03:52.710 --> 03:55.750
Don't worry, Booker.
Your mom's been working
really hard.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.210
And your designs
are amazing, Rae.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.080
There's no way
she's gonna fire you.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.380
I hope you're right, Chels.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.380
I mean, even with the money
that Devon sends,

04:02.380 --> 04:03.880
I need this job.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.210
Yeah, you do.
I just got our water bill,

04:06.210 --> 04:08.170
and it's like $400.

04:08.170 --> 04:11.250
What did we hose off? Chicago?

04:15.710 --> 04:18.920
Ma! It's not a burp
if food comes out!

04:21.580 --> 04:22.710
Hey, guys.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.880
You know you
really shouldn't leave
your door unlocked.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.830
Anybody could walk in.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.040
What's wrong with you?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.670
I had a vision that
my mom's gonna get fired.

04:32.670 --> 04:35.710
Don't worry. My mom
hasn't worked in a minute.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.670
Probably 'cause she's
always slipping and falling
at grocery stores.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.330
I just don't get it.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.290
Why would my mom get fired?

04:43.290 --> 04:44.620
She's so good at her job.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.580
Yeah, I mean it takes
a lot of talent

04:46.580 --> 04:48.540
to paint something like this.

04:48.540 --> 04:49.670
Where'd you get that?

04:49.670 --> 04:50.920
It was on the floor.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.790
This was the vest my mom
was supposed to take
to work.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.710
She must've taken mine
by accident.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.710
Then maybe that's
why she gets fired.

04:57.710 --> 05:00.620
Aunt Chels!
We have to get this vest
down to my mom.

05:00.620 --> 05:03.580
What? Oh, no.
Tess, is your mom home?

05:03.580 --> 05:06.620
Yeah, for another six weeks
until she gets the cast off.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.380
Cool. Can you have her
keep an eye on you two
till we're back?

05:11.380 --> 05:12.580
Come on.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.710
I hope Auntie Rae
doesn't get fired.

05:14.710 --> 05:17.380
Me too.
Then she'll be here
all the time.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.830
You know she can only take me
in small doses.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.000
(phone ringing)

05:24.670 --> 05:25.750
Hello?

05:26.790 --> 05:30.750
For the hundredth time,
this isn't Pete's Pizza!

05:31.920 --> 05:35.540
Hold up. What if it was
Pete's Pizza?

05:35.540 --> 05:39.540
Then I just yelled
at a hundred people
for no reason.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.750
Think about it.
You know all those people
who keep calling you for pizzas?

05:44.750 --> 05:48.000
-What about them?
-Why don't we just
sell them pizzas?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.210
It'll be a great way
to make some extra money.

05:50.210 --> 05:53.790
My mom was complaining
about the bills today.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.380
(phone ringing)

05:57.380 --> 05:58.790
Let's do it!

06:00.040 --> 06:02.830
Hello?
Yes, this is definitely
a pizza place.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.120
What kind of pie
do you want?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.210
Goat cheese and fig?

06:06.210 --> 06:08.710
Hey, Thumb Drive,
you got that stuff?

06:08.710 --> 06:11.420
We have applesauce
and cottage cheese.

06:11.420 --> 06:14.210
Eh, close enough.
One goat cheese and fig
coming up!

06:20.080 --> 06:24.790
Oh, hi, Paisley.
How was the Bark Jacobs show?

06:24.790 --> 06:27.250
We're ruined.
Everything they're doing
is so cutting edge,

06:27.250 --> 06:28.580
I need a bandage.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.540
Not literally, Jessica.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.880
Listen, I know
that you haven't liked
any of my designs--

06:35.880 --> 06:37.540
I didn't say
I didn't like them.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.750
I said I hated them.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.710
Right, thank you
for reminding me.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.670
Look, I think I might've
figured out what you want,

06:45.670 --> 06:47.170
and it's right here
in this bag.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.920
Hey, Mom!

06:48.920 --> 06:51.540
(gasps, whispers)
What are you doing here?

06:51.540 --> 06:52.830
Paisley doesn't know
that I have kids.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.670
She thinks that
you and Nia are dogs.

06:54.670 --> 06:56.500
-What, that's crazy.
-I know.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.830
What kind of dog am I?

06:58.830 --> 07:00.120
What do you want?
What do you want?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.540
You left this at home.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.710
(gasps)
If you have this,
then what does Paisley have?

07:03.710 --> 07:05.830
What is this?

07:05.830 --> 07:07.040
Listen.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.790
I don't-- What?
I don't know-- I--

07:08.790 --> 07:09.750
-I love it.
-You do?

07:09.750 --> 07:11.960
She does?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.120
It's ridiculous, but genius.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.620
(whispering)
That's exactly
what I was going for.

07:18.790 --> 07:21.210
Uh, Paisley, what do you think
about this one?

07:21.210 --> 07:23.500
It makes me wanna
stab myself in the eyes.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.080
Jessica, if you're standing
behind me with scissors,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.080
so help me,
I will fire you right now.

07:31.380 --> 07:34.380
Paisley, that's, um...
that's not my design.

07:34.380 --> 07:38.620
-What do you mean?
-She means, it's yours now,
she made it for you.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.500
-Who is this?
-This is my... This--

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
-Uh, I'm her intern.
I'm her intern.
-Yeah!

07:44.500 --> 07:47.790
I'm, um...
I'm Jean-Steve.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.420
What?
It's French.

07:53.420 --> 07:56.120
-He's so young.
-I know. I know, right?

07:56.120 --> 07:59.250
And just full of promise.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.830
You know,
and no clue about money,

08:01.830 --> 08:03.040
so I can get him for real cheap.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.420
(laughs)

08:04.420 --> 08:07.420
I need you to hand paint
the entire collection
in this style.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.290
What? This style?

08:09.290 --> 08:12.000
-You can do that, right?
-Of course she can do it.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.960
Good. Because
I'd hate to fire you.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.790
Especially now that you've
taken on Jean-Steve.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.790
No, we don't have anchovies,
but we do have gummy fish.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.710
Yes. They are wild caught.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.040
-Hi, guys!
-Hey.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.790
Um, what's
going on in here?

08:34.790 --> 08:37.620
We're selling pizzas
because we know you're
worried about money.

08:37.620 --> 08:42.040
Oh, sweetheart.
You guys didn't have
to do that.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.830
I'm about to send out
a bunch of résumés,

08:43.830 --> 08:47.000
and then I'm just an interview,
a second interview,
a background check,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.880
and a urine test away
from a job.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.750
We've already
taken all these orders.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.710
So, cancel 'em.
How much money can you
really make, anyway?

08:54.710 --> 08:58.000
Well, if we deliver
all these, 150 bucks!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.460
What? $150?
I want in.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't just hire anybody.

09:05.460 --> 09:08.170
What are your qualifications?

09:08.170 --> 09:10.580
Huh! Well, I have
restaurant experience,

09:10.580 --> 09:13.080
a valid driver's license,
and-- Oh!

09:13.080 --> 09:16.210
You're not allowed
to turn on the oven without me.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.380
-Welcome to the team!
-Mm.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.960
I think I got it.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.250
You ready?

09:26.250 --> 09:30.330
Grapes wearing a scarf!
(giggles)

09:30.330 --> 09:31.710
It's just like something
you would do.

09:31.710 --> 09:33.540
No, it's not.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.210
Grapes would never wear a scarf.
It doesn't make sense.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.540
And a plunger with top hat does?

09:41.540 --> 09:42.960
Exactly!

09:44.210 --> 09:47.040
Mom, you gotta focus.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.880
I don't want you
to get fired.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.580
I don't wanna get fired, either.
Okay, let me think.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.040
Let me think.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.880
Uh...

09:54.880 --> 09:57.960
I'll put the grapes
in a top hat.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.040
Do you even understand
what we're doing here?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.380
No, it's pretty clear
that I don't.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.750
Hurry up, Jessica!
If you can't run in heels,
you shouldn't have worn them.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.120
What is that?
It's awful.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.460
I know.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.750
See, I put the paintbrush
in my intern's hand.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.000
That was a problem,
and I'm never gonna
do that again.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.040
Really?

10:24.580 --> 10:28.000
Listen, Paisley.
I... I have to be honest.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
My creativity is blocked.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.920
And I would just feel
more inspired if I was
at home, you know?

10:33.920 --> 10:36.000
'Cause the energy
in here, girl?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.040
The energy, uh-uh,
I don't like it.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.670
-Yeah, I feel it, too.
-Yeah?

10:41.670 --> 10:43.170
(whispers)
It's Jessica.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.120
Don't, don't, don't,
Jessica.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.790
It's not worth it, girl.
It's not worth it.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.000
Oh!

10:57.000 --> 10:59.420
Oh! I got it! I got it!

10:59.420 --> 11:01.380
A gravy boat, right?

11:01.380 --> 11:03.120
And then I put a sail
in the top.

11:05.170 --> 11:07.000
Nah, that doesn't work.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.170
(sighs)

11:08.170 --> 11:10.040
I don't get it,
I really don't.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.420
I mean, I'm thinking
of silly things like you do,

11:12.420 --> 11:14.330
but then Paisley
likes your ideas
more than mine.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.290
See, see.
That's your problem.

11:16.290 --> 11:17.880
You're thinking.

11:19.540 --> 11:20.790
Don't do that.

11:23.420 --> 11:26.000
So, are you telling me
you're not even thinking
about it?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.880
Not for a second.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.170
What?
That doesn't make any sense.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.420
There! A robot with a cat face.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.080
(giggles)
Did you see that coming?

11:34.080 --> 11:35.330
I didn't.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.000
I need to make 28 more
of these for the show

11:39.000 --> 11:41.830
and I have
no idea how to do it.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.330
Don't worry, Mom,
I'll do it for you.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.960
And you can do
my math homework.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.540
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
I don't mess around
with that Common Core.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.460
Nah, but you can go ahead
and finish my stuff for me.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.250
This is so much fun.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.880
Did you always wanna
make dog clothes?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.000
No.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.620
This isn't really my dream job.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.500
I, uh... actually wanted
to make people clothes.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.170
-I still do.
-Then why aren't you doing it?

12:06.170 --> 12:09.080
'Cause you kids get hungry
and I gotta feed you.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.170
And the grocery store
doesn't take dreams.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.960
Can you believe
how many tips I got?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.330
You didn't get tips.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.210
You just didn't give
anybody change.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.830
Hey, guys.
What's up?

12:24.880 --> 12:25.960
Psst!

12:31.170 --> 12:32.250
What's up, Chels?

12:32.250 --> 12:34.420
-I have something for you.
-Okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.790
(gasps)
Where did you get this?

12:38.330 --> 12:41.540
You know how the pizza guy
always has so much extra cash
on him?

12:41.540 --> 12:45.080
Wait. Tell me you did not
jack the pizza delivery guy.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.080
What? No, Rae.

12:47.080 --> 12:50.000
The kids and I have been
making pizzas and selling them.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.380
-Yeah.
-Oh. Okay.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.960
I won't ask any questions.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.380
Rae. I didn't jack
the pizza guy.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.790
Oh. No, no, that's exactly
what I'm gonna say

12:59.790 --> 13:02.710
when they ask who jacked
the pizza delivery guy.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.830
(laughing)

13:09.880 --> 13:11.170
Love! Love!

13:11.170 --> 13:12.290
Hate...

13:12.290 --> 13:14.120
how much I love!

13:14.120 --> 13:16.460
Raven, this collection
is fantastic.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.830
Thank you!

13:17.830 --> 13:20.880
I-- I mean,
she thanks you.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.330
Hold on. Genius idea.

13:23.330 --> 13:27.420
What if during the show
you go onstage and paint
a piece live?

13:27.420 --> 13:29.120
(gasps)
I love that idea!

13:29.120 --> 13:31.000
No. No, no, no, Paisley.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.580
I can't paint
this collection live.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.210
Sure you can, it's just like
doing it at home.

13:35.210 --> 13:38.120
If you're home was nice,
and a bunch of people
were watching you.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.710
Mom, the show starts
in five minutes.

13:46.710 --> 13:49.330
You can't go out there.
Everyone will know
you're a fake.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.120
-No, we're a fake!
-I'm sorry, who's the fake?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.250
I'm the fake.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.540
Booker, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:03.540 --> 14:07.170
Yeah. I should get
a treat every time
I get my hair cut, too.

14:09.210 --> 14:11.000
You are your daddy's child.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.960
(excited chattering)

14:20.040 --> 14:21.830
Guys! I don't know
how it happened,

14:21.830 --> 14:23.790
but word's out
about our pizza.

14:23.790 --> 14:26.750
The whole floor's
full of customers waiting
for us to open.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.250
How'd they find out
where we live?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.330
Okay, listen.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.250
I figured we could make
some more cash

14:32.250 --> 14:33.880
if the customers
came to us, so,

14:33.880 --> 14:36.080
I put our address
on the receipts.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.080
I was gonna run it by you,
but I'm adult, so,
get over it.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.710
(knocking on door)

14:41.710 --> 14:44.250
Can we really
open a restaurant
in our apartment?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.290
There's only one way
to find out.

14:46.290 --> 14:49.580
Welcome to Three B Pizzeria,
table for two, hm?

14:49.580 --> 14:52.210
Right this way.

14:52.210 --> 14:57.330
Give me two corn dog pizzas,
a slice of pesto banana,
and a chef's special.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.290
(bell dings)

14:59.290 --> 15:01.830
I just ran out
of canned green beans, so...

15:01.830 --> 15:04.210
the new special is strawberry
yogurt and bacon bits.

15:05.750 --> 15:09.000
That should pair nicely
with our house fruit punch.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.960
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to the debut
of my new line.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.500
Tonight you're
in for a special treat.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.290
While you watch the hottest dogs
model my collection,

15:30.290 --> 15:33.790
my assistant designer will
live-paint an exclusive piece.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.380
(applause)

15:37.380 --> 15:39.250
Raven, what are you wearing?

15:39.250 --> 15:42.580
These? Oh. These are,
my, uh, lucky coveralls.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.040
But they're big enough
for two people.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.330
Two people, that doesn't--

15:45.330 --> 15:48.290
Paisley, why would I put two
people in my favorite coveralls?

15:48.290 --> 15:49.920
That's-- That's crazy.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.000
Just don't embarrass me.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.330
(whispers) Whoa, Mom,
that was close.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.210
I know.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.830
Just-- Just keep
your head in, all right?

16:01.830 --> 16:03.420
-It's time to paint. Okay?
-Okay, okay.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.580
Let me get them arms,
get them arms.

16:05.580 --> 16:09.290
Hello, everyone!

16:09.290 --> 16:10.710
Thank you!

16:10.710 --> 16:13.380
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!

16:13.380 --> 16:14.380
All right, okay.

16:17.250 --> 16:21.120
So, we are going to be doing
a live painting. Are you ready?

16:23.040 --> 16:26.330
First, we are going to paint.
Let's pick up a paintbrush.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.790
I don't know where it is.
Let's find it, let's find it.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.500
Right here, to the left.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.540
Oh, look, there's like a--
There's so many!

16:33.540 --> 16:36.460
if I just pick one, just--
just one, there it is!

16:36.460 --> 16:38.080
Right here, found it!

16:38.080 --> 16:40.460
It's a beautiful
paintbrush, right?

16:40.460 --> 16:41.620
Now it's time to paint.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.040
I'm gonna choose
my favorite color,
which is purple.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.620
But today it's blue.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.380
Today, it's blue.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.960
And I love to paint
with this color,

16:50.960 --> 16:52.790
but... what to paint?

16:54.120 --> 16:58.580
What... to... paint?

17:00.580 --> 17:04.000
Well, I could start
with the my face
and move forward.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.120
What are you doing?

17:05.120 --> 17:06.250
Huh?

17:08.170 --> 17:12.290
Are you just...
Are you questioning
my creative process?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.170
Just paint the vest.
I'm gonna start the show.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new Paisley Collection.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.420
(barking)

17:25.420 --> 17:27.420
Shoo! Shoo!
Get away! Get away!

17:28.380 --> 17:30.170
(barking)

17:30.170 --> 17:32.920
Stop it, that tickles!

17:32.920 --> 17:34.210
(barking)

17:34.210 --> 17:36.250
Shoo!
Okay, okay, okay.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.420
Why are these dogs
on us like this?

17:38.420 --> 17:39.960
Wait. Wait, Mom.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.460
-Our pockets are filled
with dog treats!
-(gasps)

17:42.460 --> 17:44.330
-(barking)
-Okay, get back in.
Get back in.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.040
We got to get out of here,
Booker. We got to get out.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.540
All right, now walk with me,
walk with me.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.210
-Right, left, right.
-Right, left, right.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.250
Left, right, left, right...

17:51.250 --> 17:52.290
(barking)

17:52.290 --> 17:53.460
Oh! Oh! Get away!

17:53.460 --> 17:55.920
Get away, you nasties!
Get away! Get away!

17:55.920 --> 17:57.040
Go!

18:00.120 --> 18:02.380
Oh, oh, what's that?
Stop it!

18:02.380 --> 18:03.500
(shouts)

18:03.500 --> 18:05.170
(crowd gasps)

18:08.460 --> 18:09.920
Hi!

18:12.790 --> 18:14.210
What is going on?

18:14.210 --> 18:16.540
Why is Jean-Steve
inside your coveralls?

18:16.540 --> 18:18.380
He was cold.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.580
Are you trying to ruin me?

18:21.580 --> 18:23.380
Ruin you?
Are you serious?

18:23.380 --> 18:24.750
I've been trying
to help you this whole time.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.500
I should've known
you'd mess this up.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.540
Hey, now,
you can't talk
to her that way.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.540
Actually, I can,
because I'm her boss.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.210
You know what?
I-- I-- I'm over it.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.290
I really am.

18:33.290 --> 18:35.250
I give everything
to this job, Paisley.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.620
I work long weekends.
I work long nights.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.000
I'm your best designer,
and you treat me like I'm...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.460
like I'm Jessica!

18:46.120 --> 18:47.880
Who, by the way,
you really shouldn't
treat like that.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.120
-What's your point?
-My point is...

18:51.120 --> 18:53.620
(sighs) I don't like
working for you.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.790
Well, it isn't
your dream job anyway.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.420
He's right.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.080
You know what, Paisley?

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
I quit.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.540
You can't quit.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.420
Raven, you're fired.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.830
Uh-uh! No, no, no. Now, now.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.960
Now, I think everybody heard me
when I said I quit

19:09.960 --> 19:11.880
before you said I'm fired.
You heard that, right?

19:11.880 --> 19:13.040
You heard that?
You heard it?

19:13.040 --> 19:15.880
-I heard you, Mom.
-There you go.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.460
Did your intern
just call you "Mom"?

19:18.460 --> 19:19.830
Yes. He did.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.170
Because he's not my intern.
He's my son.

19:22.170 --> 19:23.790
You have a son?

19:23.790 --> 19:25.000
Ew!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.790
I also have a daughter.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.380
Get off my stage!

19:30.380 --> 19:31.500
With pleasure.

19:34.790 --> 19:38.080
Wow, I did not see this day
going like this.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.540
Me neither.
I saw you get fired.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.460
Yeah, me too. Wait.
What'd you just say?

19:42.460 --> 19:44.040
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.420
-Okay, then.
-Good.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.290
I can't believe I just quit.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.330
Well, Mom, Paisley's
an awful person.

19:54.330 --> 19:56.330
I mean, she doesn't
appreciate you.

19:56.330 --> 19:58.290
You're way too talented
for this place.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.620
Thank you,
but I still need a job.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.960
Well, then,
you'll get a better job,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.580
making clothes for people,
like you always wanted to.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.880
You know, a wise woman
once told me,

20:08.880 --> 20:10.620
"Do you, Boo."

20:10.620 --> 20:13.330
-Hey, that was me.
-Yeah, it was you.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.500
Thanks, Boo.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.540
Step aside!
Step aside!

20:18.540 --> 20:20.330
Famous person
coming through!

20:20.330 --> 20:23.040
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!
No! No!

20:23.040 --> 20:24.710
-Don't look!
-No!

20:25.830 --> 20:27.170
Who are you?

20:27.170 --> 20:29.580
Don't you know who I be?

20:29.580 --> 20:32.330
Aah! Do you
watch reality TV?

20:32.330 --> 20:35.120
Do you like, like-a like-a
like-a social media?

20:37.170 --> 20:40.540
Do you carry
a lunch box?

20:43.670 --> 20:46.620
My name is Liz Anya.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.210
And I love that jacket!
I must have it, how much?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.580
Oh, I-- I haven't really
thought about it.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.580
Um... it's
a thousand dollars.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.670
(gasps)

20:56.670 --> 20:59.580
He's trying to outbid me.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.540
(scoffs)
Three thousand dollars.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.420
-Five thousand dollars.
-Ten thousand dollars!

21:04.420 --> 21:07.830
Both:
Final offer!

21:08.960 --> 21:10.710
Sold!

21:10.710 --> 21:12.750
Hurry up and take this off
my back before they change
their mind!

21:12.750 --> 21:14.210
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

21:14.210 --> 21:15.540
Oh!

21:15.540 --> 21:17.710
(laughs)
Gimme my money.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.500
Ten... ten thousand dollars!

21:26.500 --> 21:29.120
I can use this to start
my own clothing line.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.420
And to raise my allowance.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.460
I don't give you an allowance.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.710
Yeah, but now you got
the money to start.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.170
All right, listen!

21:43.170 --> 21:45.000
-I still need that
chef's special at table four!
-(bell dings)

21:45.000 --> 21:48.420
I told you we're eighty-six
strawberry yogurt.

21:48.420 --> 21:51.580
You gotta go grocery shopping
before you open a restaurant!

21:53.330 --> 21:56.540
We've had some customers
complain, so I'm gonna
clean the bathroom.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.710
Okay.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.210
Uh, what is going on here?

21:59.210 --> 22:01.000
(mumbling)
Yeah, what is going on?

22:03.250 --> 22:05.790
Rae, thank goodness you're here.
Listen, I turned our apartment

22:05.790 --> 22:07.580
into a restaurant, but I can't
keep up with the orders,

22:07.580 --> 22:10.710
and our diners are angry,
and our staff is up way past
their bedtimes.

22:10.710 --> 22:13.330
Yo, Red, I got orders
dying in the window!

22:13.330 --> 22:14.710
I know!

22:14.710 --> 22:18.540
Listen, Rae. I think
it's time I get a job.
I just-- I don't think

22:18.540 --> 22:20.790
it should be
running a restaurant
in our living room.

22:20.790 --> 22:22.500
Yeah, probably not.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.620
Listen, okay,
I'm in way over my head.
Can you help me?

22:25.620 --> 22:28.880
It can be like old times,
you know, with your dad
at the Chill Grill, right?

22:30.250 --> 22:33.420
All right, I mean,
it's been a while,
but I'll see.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.620
Whoa, we are
in the weeds here, people!

22:36.620 --> 22:38.380
I got two pies on table nine,

22:38.380 --> 22:41.120
and table 14 never got
their order.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.120
Wow. It really does come back.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.710
Hey! Hey, Booker!

22:44.710 --> 22:45.880
If you can chill, you can grill.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.920
Get in that kitchen, boy!

22:49.750 --> 22:52.330
I know I said I'd clean
the bathroom,

22:52.330 --> 22:54.670
but we're just gonna
have to move!
