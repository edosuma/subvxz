04:28.750 --> 04:29.916
What are you looking at?

04:29.958 --> 04:31.416
huh?

04:31.458 --> 04:37.874
Get up.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.957
Turn it.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.207
No parking here.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.624
Move your car.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.207
We got delayed in the vault.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.957
Report to me if anything happens.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.957
Let me know if anything happens.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.374
Clear?

05:43.708 --> 05:45.624
Is everything alright outhere

05:47.250 --> 05:49.124
Chubby?

05:50.458 --> 05:51.249
Stop.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.207
1113 calling Control.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.332
Boss

06:05.375 --> 06:06.957
Chubby's caught.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.374
He drove away.

06:41.875 --> 06:42.707
Go.

06:42.750 --> 06:43.666
Block the entrance.

06:43.708 --> 06:44.416
You.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.874
Search for other exits.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.457
Chong Qing,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.457
as we know,

08:10.500 --> 08:12.957
is a city of hot pot.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.707
Hot pot restaurants are everywhere.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.541
Yet

08:17.583 --> 08:19.791
people have no idea that

08:19.833 --> 08:21.832
Chong Qing

08:21.875 --> 08:25.207
is also a city of bomb shelters

08:25.250 --> 08:29.832
appear like underground caves.

08:29.875 --> 08:34.207
The caves

08:34.250 --> 08:36.249
are all over the place.

08:44.833 --> 08:48.291
The combination of hot pot and bomb shelters

08:48.375 --> 08:51.332
make something unique.

08:51.375 --> 08:52.416
"Cave Hot Pot"

08:52.458 --> 08:54.582
A hot pot restaurant inside a cave.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.582
Both delicious and fun.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.332
You couldn't find

08:58.375 --> 09:00.416
these kind restaurant anywhere else.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.499
Four Eyes, this is Mr. Zhang.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.082
This is our smallest shareholder.

09:07.125 --> 09:10.791
Take this opportunity and profit will be huge.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.457
Where's the other shareholder? Is he coming?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.082
Four Eyes!

09:15.125 --> 09:16.541
Call Liu Bo.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.624
Tell him to hurry up.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.457
Why don't you pick it up?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.457
it's bugging the hell out of me

09:34.000 --> 09:35.166
Flush with a quadruplet.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.832
Money money.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.374
It doesn't fucking bug me.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.582
Want some fish?

09:50.625 --> 09:51.707
this one then

09:51.750 --> 09:53.707
More than a kilo.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.249
Liu Bo.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.916
Mr.Seven! What a coincidence!

09:58.958 --> 10:00.332
Getting fish?

10:00.375 --> 10:01.874
What's up?

10:02.625 --> 10:05.082
Went to meet a buddy.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.749
It's time to pay your gambling debt.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.582
I'll have the money after I sell my restaurant.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.249
How long will it take?

10:22.250 --> 10:23.624
No more than a week.

10:25.083 --> 10:33.041
A week.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.666
Two hundred and thirty thousand.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.332
Not a penny less.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.249
I see you around.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.957
Want the Head cut?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.374
Yeah.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.957
If the restaurant sells for 250k,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.166
I'll get

10:59.208 --> 11:00.332
Seventy five thousand.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.957
Four Eyes will get

11:02.000 --> 11:03.332
Twenty nine thousand.

11:03.375 --> 11:04.832
Liu Bo will get

11:04.875 --> 11:05.832
Ninety six thousand.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.416
You forgot the three thousand
for hiring the extras.

11:09.458 --> 11:10.582
What extras?

11:10.625 --> 11:12.166
People who played the customers.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.707
You thought they really came for our hot pot?

11:15.083 --> 11:18.207
You promised four hundred thousand.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.582
That bastard also went to other cave hot pots.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.457
They are all bigger than ours.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.957
He promised

11:25.000 --> 11:28.249
400k if we make a 300 square meters extension.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.957
An extension requires a lot of money

11:31.000 --> 11:32.541
At least fifty thousand.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.249
Xu Dong, you should pay for it.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.457
It's not just my own business.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.666
Why should I pay for the entire thing?

11:39.708 --> 11:41.832
Was your memory eaten by dogs?

11:41.875 --> 11:42.916
When we started the business,

11:42.958 --> 11:45.207
I gave you the money to dig through the cave

11:45.250 --> 11:46.207
but you ignored,

11:46.250 --> 11:48.582
and enshrined a budda with the money instead.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.582
Is the budda gonna pay for us?

11:49.625 --> 11:50.582
The blessing of the budda

11:50.625 --> 11:52.124
brings wealth.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.416
Brings wealth?

11:55.458 --> 11:56.832
Where is the wealth then?

11:56.875 --> 11:57.707
We've been losing money from the beginning.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.207
It's not just my fault.

12:00.250 --> 12:00.957
Four Eyes.

12:01.000 --> 12:01.832
Come on, say something.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.207
You guys,

12:03.250 --> 12:05.457
should pay for the electricity first.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.707
I steal electricity every day

12:07.750 --> 12:09.082
from door to door.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.957
There's not much left.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.207
Stop worshipping.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.957
Does it bring you wealth?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.916
There are way too many
hot pot restaurants in Chongqing.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.291
How can it be profitable?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.916
Stop complaining.

12:36.958 --> 12:39.332
We don't even have the money
for your grandpa's ward.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.541
Don't expect anything from me.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.332
I'm going dancing. No cigarettes for him.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.499
I'm not taking the keys.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.541
Grandpa, wait for me to come home
if you wanna smoke.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.291
Don't secretly smoke by yourself.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.207
Yeah.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.124
Oh! Wait!

13:21.125 --> 13:22.374
Coming!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.207
It's you guys.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.957
Make some noise next time.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.249
Hi grandpa!

13:31.125 --> 13:32.124
Hello grandpa!

13:32.250 --> 13:33.082
Taking a bath?

13:33.125 --> 13:34.249
Yea.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.041
You didn't go to the night class today.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.791
It's summer break now.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.416
oh it's summer break.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.291
Making the extension ourselves

13:45.333 --> 13:46.707
is illegal.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.166
But it's our last chance.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.957
We are broke.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.166
Broke?

13:51.208 --> 13:52.957
Sell your car then.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.207
It's a gift from my wife.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.666
Don't be ridiculous.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.957
You are still students.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.832
Don't play around with girls.

14:03.958 --> 14:04.707
Grandpa,

14:04.750 --> 14:06.999
He's the only one with a girlfriend.

14:07.083 --> 14:07.832
Grandpa,

14:07.875 --> 14:09.082
don't listen to him.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.457
I'm still a virgin.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.832
What the hell.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.332
The real virgin is Four Eyes.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.457
Bullshit.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.707
I'm not a fuckin virgin.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.332
When we just started the business,

14:30.375 --> 14:33.457
a buddy from the Civil Air Defense
showed me the blueprint of this cave.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.207
The space above is at least
three hundred square meters.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.624
We can have 400k if we make the extension.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.207
you are being lazy again

14:47.250 --> 14:48.874
I'm thinking.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.082
Did you know that

14:52.125 --> 14:53.166
Four Eyes

14:53.208 --> 14:54.374
plans to move to Beijing?

14:55.083 --> 14:55.916
to Beijing?

14:55.958 --> 14:57.457
He's going to stay with one of his relatives,

14:57.500 --> 14:58.832
who does construction work.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.499
Traitor.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.999
We shouldn't have dragged him
into this business at all.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.832
No. We shouldn't have opened the restaurant.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.582
You know, I have a friend

15:07.625 --> 15:08.832
who runs a massage center.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.624
He's already bought seven
or eight apartments now.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.166
We should check it out when we have time.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.791
Stop talking about massage center.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.082
We have been digging for almost a week.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.624
Perhaps there's something wrong
with the drawing.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.916
I swear to god

15:25.958 --> 15:28.207
this drawing is absolutely solid.

15:47.708 --> 15:50.624
Feels like we've hit a bomb.

15:51.875 --> 15:53.207
Four Eyes, what's up there?

15:53.250 --> 15:55.874
I don't know. It's pitch black.

15:57.250 --> 15:57.957
Come on.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.707
Four Eyes, give me a hand.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.957
Four Eyes.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.832
You stepped on me.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.082
Come quickly!

16:11.125 --> 16:13.332
What?

16:21.875 --> 16:23.207
Oh-My-God!

16:23.250 --> 16:24.916
Whose money is this?

16:24.958 --> 16:26.957
Who cares?

16:56.875 --> 16:59.207
It'll take them a couple of days
to trace it back to us

16:59.250 --> 17:02.957
if we bomb the mouth.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.082
By that time we'll be far gone.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.332
My grandpa is over eighty.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.374
He can't even take a bath by himself.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.082
How can we take him?

17:14.125 --> 17:16.665
We can't, of course.

17:16.708 --> 17:19.082
Don't be ridiculous.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.957
Heroes ride dragons and tigers.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.082
Cowards only ride old hens.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.540
Look at us.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.249
We've accomplished nothing...

17:34.333 --> 17:35.749
Are we gonna do it or not?

17:53.625 --> 17:56.374
Honey, you're still up?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.957
I'm in the restaurant,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.332
talking business with Liu Bo and Four Eyes.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.791
Mengmeng, this is Liu Bo.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.707
Mengmeng, this is Four Eyes

18:11.750 --> 18:14.332
Believe me now?

18:14.375 --> 18:17.666
Ok, we need to get back to work.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.249
Kiss kiss.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.499
Bitch.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.749
Forget it.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.832
Let's fix the hole.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.832
It's exhausting to ride tigers and dragons.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.874
What about you?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.624
I wanna be with my family.

18:47.833 --> 18:50.957
Get out!

18:51.000 --> 18:53.082
This pot is just like the mouth of the cave.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.707
If we wanna fix it,

18:54.750 --> 18:57.582
we need to fill in with rocks and concrete.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.332
But no matter how we do with it,

18:59.375 --> 19:02.332
we must trowel the surface

19:02.375 --> 19:04.041
and lay the tiles.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.249
Then it's done?

19:06.458 --> 19:07.582
The problem is

19:07.625 --> 19:09.457
how could the one who trowels the floor

19:09.500 --> 19:11.582
get out of the vault?

19:11.625 --> 19:13.249
by teleporting?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.207
Unless he's from the bank.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.541
We'll definitely lose our restaurant.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.124
Confess? Confess what?

19:24.625 --> 19:26.249
We'll definitely lose our restaurant
if we take that step.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.749
I'm not doing that.

19:29.958 --> 19:33.832
We run a hot pot restaurant on Baixiang Street.

19:33.875 --> 19:34.916
Cave Hot Pot.

19:34.958 --> 19:37.957
We made a little bit extension...

19:38.000 --> 19:39.999
but we didn't know that...

19:40.833 --> 19:42.457
We dug into the bank...

19:42.500 --> 19:44.207
Hold on.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.957
Guo Jianxin.

19:47.000 --> 19:47.707
Yes?

19:47.750 --> 19:50.541
You mixed up the two ID numbers again.

19:50.583 --> 19:51.416
What's your problem?

19:51.458 --> 19:52.582
Impossible. Let me see.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.624
Here. №1 and №2.

20:00.625 --> 20:01.624
Next.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.374
What's up?

20:03.750 --> 20:06.707
San Tu just called me.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.582
Our middle school classmate works
in that bank now.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.957
Who?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.082
Which classmate?

20:15.625 --> 20:17.207
A girl

20:18.000 --> 20:19.249
who speaks mandarin.

20:22.750 --> 21:12.666
Yu Xiaohui!

21:12.708 --> 21:13.957
You always make this fridge smell
like Chinese medicine.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.249
How are we supposed to use it?

21:16.250 --> 21:17.582
It won't be smelly.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.957
I always cover it with layers of plastic film

21:19.000 --> 21:20.207
before I put it in.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.332
All drugs are somehow toxic.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.082
Your poisonous stuff...

21:23.125 --> 21:25.249
can't be put next to my dessert.

21:26.625 --> 21:29.082
How can it be poisonous?

21:29.125 --> 21:30.624
This is my dad's herbal medicine.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.832
everybody is welcome to use this fridge

21:32.875 --> 21:34.624
except you.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.041
Zhang's father is somebody.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.166
Your father is nobody.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.207
We won't

21:50.250 --> 21:52.541
be able to hit our monthly saving goal

21:52.583 --> 21:55.457
without the deposit from her father's company.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.207
There are so many people in our bank.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.291
Why do you have to be her rival?

21:59.333 --> 22:01.124
I don't see her as my rival.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.041
I need to prepare the medicine at home

22:04.083 --> 22:04.832
and take it with me to the bank everyday.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.707
I'm not talking about the medicine.

22:07.375 --> 22:08.249
Yu Xiaohui

22:08.625 --> 22:10.916
Why didn't you sign her credit certification?

22:10.958 --> 22:13.916
Because her certificates are incomplete.

22:13.958 --> 22:14.916
I'm following our bank's regulations.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.957
I understand.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.082
But sometimes

22:19.125 --> 22:20.207
we need to be flexible when

22:20.250 --> 22:22.374
dealing with real situations.

22:26.375 --> 22:27.457
Flexible? How?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.791
Flexible...

22:28.833 --> 22:30.832
Just...

22:30.875 --> 22:33.207
You are asking me to teach you this?

22:33.250 --> 22:34.291
Forget it.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.832
Get back to work now.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.582
Mr. Seven. What's up?

23:12.625 --> 23:15.624
Have you sold your lousy restaurant yet?

23:17.708 --> 23:18.624
Almost!

23:19.042 --> 23:20.499
You get the money

23:20.542 --> 23:22.082
or you don't.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.291
What the hell does "almost" mean?

23:24.333 --> 23:25.957
Soon... In two days...

23:30.125 --> 23:32.291
ln two days, I must see the cash.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.249
This is my final warning.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.124
No problem. Two days.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.999
Liu Bo!

23:48.625 --> 23:50.124
I'm Yu Xiaohui!

23:50.500 --> 23:52.499
I'm your classmate from No. 18 middle school

23:56.250 --> 23:57.374
I...

23:59.375 --> 24:02.166
I work in the bank nearby.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.874
Changjiang Business Bank

24:04.958 --> 24:06.957
How do you know?

24:09.208 --> 24:11.499
There's only one bank around.

24:13.208 --> 24:14.499
Right.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.082
We opened a hot pot restaurant.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.957
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?

24:24.208 --> 24:26.624
Plus Xu Dong and Four Eyes.

24:27.583 --> 24:28.957
I give you my card.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.374
You guys are still hanging out together?

24:44.250 --> 24:46.499
Yeah. We run the restaurant together.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.166
See you later, ya?

24:48.208 --> 24:48.957
Okay.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.874
Deal?

24:52.083 --> 24:53.374
Call me!

25:06.750 --> 25:08.124
Cheers!

25:09.833 --> 25:11.749
Why aren't you guys drinking?

25:12.625 --> 25:14.582
We are too old to drink.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.791
When we were in the band,

25:17.833 --> 25:21.541
we could beat a dozen of people

25:21.625 --> 25:24.791
with liquor and beer.

25:24.833 --> 25:25.707
Come on.

25:28.833 --> 25:29.832
Liu Bo.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.874
What was the name again? Your band.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.791
don't remember. It was stupid actually.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.707
We used to have a fancy English name.

25:37.750 --> 25:41.374
but then they called us
The Grasshoppers of Shapingba.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.124
The Grasshoppers of Shapingba.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.582
Well.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.707
A hero is silent about his past glories.

25:53.750 --> 25:57.332
Yu Xiaohui.
You and Liu Bo are mean to meet again.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.707
For the memories of old classmates, old friends,

25:59.750 --> 26:00.999
Let's take a shot.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.624
Why do you drink with her?

26:03.667 --> 26:05.541
I think the Gasshoppers of Shapinga

26:05.583 --> 26:07.207
should take a shot.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.082
You are drunk.

26:09.125 --> 26:09.999
No. I'm not!

26:10.500 --> 26:11.041
Come on.

26:11.083 --> 26:11.999
I drink it up first.

26:14.625 --> 26:15.707
Liu Bo.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.249
Have a drink with Yu Xiaohui.

26:21.708 --> 26:22.499
Yu Xiaohui.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.249
Yu Xiaohui. I will drink it for you.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.249
That's enough.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.249
What?

26:32.500 --> 26:35.374
Go work on the renovation.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.957
You are gonna sell it anyway, Why bother?

26:42.208 --> 26:44.291
This is a good business

26:44.333 --> 26:46.082
why do you sell it?

26:46.500 --> 26:47.791
It's a side-business anyway...

26:47.833 --> 26:48.957
doesn't matter.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.582
We can quit whenever we want...

26:50.625 --> 26:51.707
Yeah, right.

26:51.750 --> 26:52.832
For you guys it's just a side-business.

26:52.875 --> 26:55.291
I'm the only one who takes it seriously.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.957
You go out and play Mahjong everyday,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.207
and leave everything to me.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.416
Now the business is failing,

27:01.458 --> 27:03.207
and you put on a performance
in front of our classmate.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.874
Shame on you!

27:06.375 --> 27:07.832
What performance?

27:13.375 --> 27:15.832
No performance.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.416
Four Eyes's just drunk.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.832
You take Yu Xiaohui home first.

27:19.875 --> 27:20.707
Go.

27:20.750 --> 27:23.207
Four Eyes is right.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.999
What a show! Why not just tell the truth.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.249
Yu Xiaohui,

27:43.958 --> 27:46.499
it was arranged for us to meet again.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.874
We hope you could do us a favor.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.249
We really don't have any other choice.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.624
Yu Xiaohui.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.957
No.

28:57.833 --> 28:59.332
I woke up a while ago.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.749
What's up?

29:03.500 --> 29:06.999
I'll be right there.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.082
You've been waited?

29:57.500 --> 29:58.874
No, not long.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.207
I came up with a plan for you.

30:05.625 --> 30:08.582
An order came from the Government two days ago

30:08.625 --> 30:10.707
All banks over 30 years old
located in the old town

30:10.750 --> 30:12.582
require a complete

30:12.625 --> 30:16.124
infrastructure test and upgrade.

30:16.208 --> 30:19.332
Our bank is one of them.

30:19.375 --> 30:22.457
I contacted a security company two days ago.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.666
They'll come to the bank

30:24.708 --> 30:27.749
and do a surveying and
mapping test for the vault.

30:30.083 --> 30:32.707
You mean,

30:32.750 --> 30:36.707
we could ask the surveyor to fix the hole?

30:36.750 --> 30:38.457
I mean,

30:38.500 --> 30:42.166
one of you would be the surveyor.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.791
The bank doesn't know anything
about the surveyor.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.457
All of the information is verified through e-mails.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.832
I can recreate the I D information
and change it to yours.

30:50.875 --> 30:54.332
When you arrive at the bank,
I'll call the security company

30:54.375 --> 30:56.916
and ask them to change their schedule

30:56.958 --> 30:58.832
for our account check in the vault.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.249
I can send them an artifical data later.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.749
After you enter the bank,
two security guards will do a body check.

31:04.875 --> 31:08.249
They will check your tool box
and verify your ID information.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.749
Then the two vault keepers

31:10.792 --> 31:12.707
would take you to the vault.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.332
The entrance needs to be unlocked by two keys.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.332
Ms.Xu has one key and the dept.
Chief Kuang keeps the other one.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.416
Usually, Ms.Xu will leave right
after she unlocks the door,

31:21.458 --> 31:24.082
leaving Chief Kuang and the two guards there.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.332
You won't be able to do anything

31:26.375 --> 31:27.957
if the three of them keep their eyes on you.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.374
What do we do then?

31:29.833 --> 31:32.916
When you guys get to the vault,
I'll give Xu Dong a message

31:32.958 --> 31:34.957
asking him to make a phone call to the bank

31:35.000 --> 31:37.957
pretending it's from Kuang's son's school.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.916
Kuang takes every single phone call
from the school.

31:40.958 --> 31:43.332
When he leaves, he'll ask Ms.Xu for help.

31:43.375 --> 31:45.541
Ms. Xu is fat and she hates walking up
and down the stairs.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.582
Therefore she will ask me to take this charge.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.582
I'll bring a stack of documents,

31:49.625 --> 31:51.582
and drop them on purpose

31:51.625 --> 31:54.332
when I get to the vault.

31:54.375 --> 31:57.082
The guards will help me pick up the documents,

31:57.125 --> 32:01.624
you can use that time to fix the hole.

32:04.750 --> 32:05.916
Are we

32:05.958 --> 32:07.582
gonna have

32:07.625 --> 32:08.832
enough time?

32:08.875 --> 32:10.457
The documents

32:10.500 --> 32:13.707
are not just the regular documents.

32:13.750 --> 32:17.457
They are the paysheets for this month.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.957
The two guards are included of course.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.416
As long as they are able to read,

32:22.458 --> 32:25.124
they will pick them as slowly as they can,
to check their pay.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.166
What do you think

32:28.250 --> 32:29.999
about this plan?

32:37.333 --> 32:38.332
Yu Xiaohui.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.374
Why are you willing to help us?

32:46.750 --> 32:48.499
Because...

32:49.875 --> 32:52.249
I wanted to be flexible.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.332
Understand.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.791
Don't worry

32:57.833 --> 32:59.207
If you help us with this,

32:59.250 --> 33:00.999
you won't be left empty handed.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.166
That's not the reason.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.957
I'll take care of it.

33:05.000 --> 33:05.999
If you need anything,

33:06.708 --> 33:07.874
Just tell me.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.582
Okay...

33:14.000 --> 33:15.499
hum...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.082
Give me the letter back.

33:24.333 --> 33:28.582
We knew Yu Xiaohui had a crush on you,

33:28.625 --> 33:31.957
However, we knew nothing about the letter.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.957
Yu Xiaohui gave me that letter

33:34.000 --> 33:35.666
and asked me to pass it to Liu Bo.

33:35.708 --> 33:37.832
When I was almost back in my seat,

33:37.875 --> 33:39.749
You snatched the letter.

33:40.125 --> 33:41.374
No way.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.249
Why would I snatch his letter?

33:44.333 --> 33:47.082
You took the letter

33:47.125 --> 33:49.207
showed it off in the classroom.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.499
Everybody laughed about it.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.082
What happened next?

33:54.125 --> 33:56.249
Where's the letter now then?

33:58.250 --> 33:59.207
I have no idea.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.957
Do you have it?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.749
Why would I?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.082
It's not for me.

34:06.125 --> 34:08.498
Hurry up and go find it.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.791
Liu Bo

34:49.833 --> 34:51.498
Your classmates are here!

34:52.833 --> 34:54.416
You are up?

34:54.458 --> 34:56.706
I assume that you had a good sleep.

34:56.750 --> 34:57.874
Mr.Seven.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.582
Let's talk outside.

35:04.083 --> 35:04.957
Grandpa

35:05.000 --> 35:07.082
We are going out, I'll visit you another day.

35:07.125 --> 35:08.249
Take care.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.957
I hate liars.

35:35.000 --> 35:35.957
In three days,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.499
If I don't see the cash,

35:38.500 --> 35:40.166
I'll throw you

35:40.208 --> 35:42.582
and that old crock inside

35:42.625 --> 35:44.332
out of the building.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.791
It's my own business.

35:45.833 --> 35:47.124
It has nothing to do with my grandpa!

35:49.250 --> 35:51.666
Stop fucking yelling at me!

35:51.708 --> 35:54.249
Pay me back first.

35:54.708 --> 35:55.707
Liu Bo

35:55.750 --> 35:56.957
You'd better pay my money back soon.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.624
for the sake of your family's safty.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.791
How many times do I have to tell you?

36:16.833 --> 36:20.082
I told you not to mess around with the gangs,
you never listen.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.207
Today they hit your head.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.124
What about tomorrow? They might cut your hands
off and break your ankles.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.291
What's up?

36:26.333 --> 36:27.457
I want to borrow some money.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.332
What's this?

36:29.375 --> 36:30.666
Stop it.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.291
I'm talking to Liu Bo.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.332
Screw you!

36:33.375 --> 36:34.916
I was doing field research.

36:34.958 --> 36:37.332
I was doing the field research.

36:37.375 --> 36:38.957
Liu Bo was with me.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.082
You can ask him.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.832
How can you keep borrowing money like this?

36:43.875 --> 36:47.082
So much money! Are you able to pay it back?

36:47.125 --> 36:49.374
Just like your father,

36:50.083 --> 36:52.332
You'll end up dead on the street sooner or later.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.499
Where are you going? Liu Bo!

37:10.250 --> 37:11.832
You're back.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.374
When are you leaving for Beijing?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.707
In two days.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.666
Four Eyes.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.207
Let's have hot pot together before you leave.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.582
Yeah.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.457
I'll prepare.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.582
Go home tonight.

37:33.625 --> 37:35.499
I'll stay here.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.374
It's all right.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.749
Go easy on the drinking.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.124
Liu Bo

37:50.875 --> 37:53.707
I brought you the yellow bag,

37:53.750 --> 37:55.582
the one you lent me last time.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.832
I put it on the table.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.499
Remember to pick it up.

38:37.458 --> 38:38.707
It's so thick.

38:40.750 --> 38:41.624
Just you know,

38:43.625 --> 38:45.416
I borrowed this money

38:45.458 --> 38:47.749
and I need to bring it back tomorrow morning.

38:47.833 --> 38:50.082
I'll leave once I double the amount and I mean it.

38:50.208 --> 38:52.207
Okay.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.249
Chill.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.624
Do you still remember the secret signal?

39:03.250 --> 39:05.791
What does your friend do?

39:05.833 --> 39:07.582
He runs hot pot restaurants.

39:07.625 --> 39:09.957
He already has several branches.

39:14.708 --> 39:15.332
Kong.

39:22.625 --> 39:23.582
What?

39:26.708 --> 39:27.832
Excuse me.

39:27.875 --> 39:28.457
Don't leave.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.666
I'll be right back.

39:29.708 --> 39:30.582
Hold on. I'll be right back.

39:30.625 --> 39:31.916
We're one person short.

39:31.958 --> 39:32.666
Come back soon!

39:34.875 --> 39:36.957
Perhaps he noticed?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.332
No way.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.499
I haven't even started the signal.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.374
Liu Bo, where were you?

39:52.417 --> 39:53.416
Where's grandpa?

39:55.167 --> 39:56.332
There was a fire in our apartment.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.124
How dare you give him cigarettes again!

40:01.167 --> 40:02.791
Liu Bo's back.

40:04.875 --> 40:05.999
Liu Bo.

40:06.042 --> 40:07.624
Where did you go?

40:07.667 --> 40:09.624
Thank god the delivery guy came just in time.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.499
Liu Bo. Here you are.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.791
Your classmate was here.

40:20.667 --> 40:21.791
Which one?

40:32.250 --> 40:33.707
Our apartment is ruined.

40:33.750 --> 40:36.249
Where are your grandpa and mom gonna stay tonight?

40:36.292 --> 40:37.957
My grandpa will stay at my uncle's.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.791
I'll just stay in the restaurant.

40:43.417 --> 40:46.374
Lost Love Alliance.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.499
I remembered the name wrong.

40:51.292 --> 40:53.624
I remembered that you guys

40:53.667 --> 40:55.791
used to jam in the school factory.

40:56.792 --> 40:58.791
How did you know we were there?

41:00.792 --> 41:02.832
When we were in middle school,

41:02.875 --> 41:07.749
one day I went back home alone after class.

41:07.792 --> 41:10.749
I was mugged by a gangster with
a knife at the school gate.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.541
He took me to the school factory.

41:14.792 --> 41:16.916
I was terrified.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.374
Then I heard some noises outside.

41:19.417 --> 41:22.082
I told him that my boyfriend was coming.

41:22.125 --> 41:25.207
He got nervous and ran away.

41:25.292 --> 41:26.874
But I was too afraid to leave.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.499
I had no idea who was actually coming.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.832
Later I heard a Grasshopper song playing outside.

41:34.875 --> 41:37.874
So I quietly had a look.

41:39.792 --> 41:43.499
I saw a boy dancing to the song.

41:46.292 --> 41:49.124
After a while Xu Dong and Four Eyes joined in.

41:49.167 --> 41:51.249
Then they danced all together.

41:57.375 --> 41:58.916
You're talking about me?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.291
Yeah.

42:06.875 --> 42:09.124
That's why I wrote you the letter.

42:12.417 --> 42:14.332
Look at this apartment.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.249
I don't think that I can find the letter.

42:16.292 --> 42:17.707
Leave it now then.

42:17.750 --> 42:20.166
Perhaps pay me back with something else later.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.041
You remember the whole plan?

42:31.417 --> 42:33.332
8:30 a. m. tomorrow morning.

42:33.375 --> 42:34.916
Meet me in the subway station.

42:35.792 --> 42:37.166
Okay.

42:48.167 --> 42:49.541
Liu Bo.

42:54.042 --> 42:56.582
When all this is over

42:56.625 --> 42:59.041
Get back to your business and do it well.

43:00.667 --> 43:03.541
You guys have been friends
for more than ten years.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.291
It's not easy.

43:10.792 --> 43:12.624
Ok.

43:42.542 --> 43:44.291
Liu Bo, you're back.

43:45.042 --> 43:45.957
Your buddies are here

43:46.000 --> 43:46.916
to have a drink with you.

43:56.750 --> 43:57.707
Mr. Seven

43:57.750 --> 43:58.916
You are here...

43:59.292 --> 43:59.957
I heard that

44:00.000 --> 44:01.957
you brought a bag of cash

44:02.000 --> 44:03.541
to play Mahjong.

44:04.542 --> 44:05.874
You must be doing great.

44:05.917 --> 44:09.207
Why the hell did you tell me
you can't pay me back.

44:09.250 --> 44:11.999
What do you say now?

44:12.042 --> 44:13.124
Mr. Seven

44:13.167 --> 44:15.874
It will sort itself out, but it's not time yet.

44:15.958 --> 44:17.541
I fuckin' made the time,

44:17.583 --> 44:19.124
I can also change it.

44:19.292 --> 44:20.666
Mr.Seven, drink!

44:25.250 --> 44:28.124
Take out the cash and I call them off.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.874
I don't have the money for you.

44:31.542 --> 44:32.374
Yeah, he doesn't.

44:32.417 --> 44:33.124
I'm sure.

44:36.042 --> 44:38.791
Open your bag then.

44:43.917 --> 44:45.624
I can't give you the bag.

44:45.667 --> 44:47.249
Give it to me!

44:47.292 --> 44:47.999
No!

44:48.042 --> 44:49.624
What the hell!

44:50.750 --> 44:53.749
Mr.Seven, this might be a misunderstanding.

44:57.292 --> 44:58.291
Get him!

44:59.042 --> 45:00.874
What's going on here?

45:00.917 --> 45:03.124
lsn't it obvious?

45:04.250 --> 45:05.999
Sit.

46:09.000 --> 46:09.999
Run!!!

46:13.292 --> 46:16.207
Stop it!

46:16.292 --> 46:18.332
Mr.Seven, please.

46:18.375 --> 46:20.666
for the sake of me. I am respected here.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.124
It's not too late for us to find the money
and bring it back to the vault.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.374
Where? How?

47:48.417 --> 47:50.207
Rob the bank?!

47:50.250 --> 47:52.707
The bank will open soon.

47:52.750 --> 47:54.457
Go for it then!

47:54.500 --> 47:56.874
Rob the bank then
put the money back to the vault ya?

47:56.917 --> 47:58.791
You are such a loyal friend!

48:03.875 --> 48:05.249
So what have you done?

48:05.292 --> 48:06.874
What have you done for the restaurant?

48:06.917 --> 48:07.874
What do you mean?

48:08.542 --> 48:09.541
What do I mean?

48:10.542 --> 48:12.749
You are the richest among us.

48:12.792 --> 48:15.374
But you are so stingy all the time.

48:15.417 --> 48:17.249
Well, it's true that Liu bo's into gambling.

48:17.292 --> 48:19.166
Yet he pays for his part.

48:19.208 --> 48:20.082
If you could pay for

48:20.125 --> 48:21.916
a professional extension

48:22.292 --> 48:23.416
Everything would be OK.

48:26.167 --> 48:27.707
Are you fuckin crazy?

48:27.750 --> 48:29.166
Haven't got enough?

48:30.667 --> 48:31.374
You wanna beat me?

48:31.417 --> 48:33.999
Go ahead!

48:34.042 --> 48:34.957
Stop!

48:35.000 --> 48:36.166
It's all my fault.

48:36.250 --> 48:37.166
We are all brothers.

48:37.292 --> 48:40.291
Good mates.

48:42.042 --> 48:44.499
No, we are not.

48:44.542 --> 48:45.707
Not anymore.

48:45.750 --> 48:48.124
You've never took us as your buddies.

48:48.167 --> 48:49.207
Fine.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.499
Forget about the brotherhood.

48:50.542 --> 48:52.082
It has nothing to do with you guys.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.582
Either going to jail or paying back the money.

48:53.625 --> 48:54.541
They are all on me.

48:58.750 --> 49:01.207
We have been friends since middle school.

49:01.250 --> 49:07.499
Have you ever considered that what would happen
to us when you took the money?

49:07.542 --> 49:11.207
Look at me!

49:11.250 --> 49:13.416
What do we mean to you?

50:00.042 --> 50:02.416
You've really made your decision?

50:07.042 --> 50:08.541
Yes.

50:09.167 --> 50:11.874
I'm gonna turn myself in,
I dug the hole and took the money.

50:11.917 --> 50:13.957
You guys only knew that I dug a hole,

50:14.042 --> 50:15.749
have no idea that I cracked into the bank.

50:15.792 --> 50:17.999
Remember, you knew nothing

50:18.042 --> 50:19.749
We are fine.

50:19.792 --> 50:21.791
It's just Yu Xiaohui.

52:13.792 --> 52:16.499
I'm the owner of the hot pot restaurant
on Baixing Street.

52:16.542 --> 52:18.749
the 'Cave Hot Pot'.

52:19.625 --> 52:21.457
I made an extension ourselves

52:21.500 --> 52:24.832
in order to save some money.

52:24.875 --> 52:25.999
But unexpectedly,

52:26.042 --> 52:27.749
we dug into the bank.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.499
The bank?

52:30.542 --> 52:32.374
I didn't mean to do it.

52:32.417 --> 52:33.582
Hold on.

52:33.625 --> 52:34.749
Hello?

52:34.792 --> 52:36.082
What?

52:36.125 --> 52:37.416
The bank is robbed?

52:38.417 --> 52:40.457
Which one?

52:40.500 --> 52:42.124
Shangxin Street

52:42.167 --> 52:43.999
Changjiang Business Bank

52:44.042 --> 52:45.082
Yes. We'll be right there.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.374
Changing Business Bank on Shangxin street.

52:47.417 --> 52:48.999
Officer,

52:49.042 --> 52:50.499
isn't it

52:50.542 --> 52:52.249
Is it Changing Business Bank?

52:52.292 --> 52:53.666
Tell me!

53:01.167 --> 53:02.374
Any more cell phones?

53:02.417 --> 53:04.249
Give them all to me.

53:09.667 --> 53:11.207
What?

53:11.250 --> 53:12.874
The bank is robbed.

53:15.542 --> 53:17.499
What's going on ?

53:17.542 --> 53:18.874
Police are on their way.

53:18.917 --> 53:21.624
I called Yu Xiaohui but she didn't pick up.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.832
She must be in the bank.

53:23.875 --> 53:25.457
Do the robbers know about this hole?

53:25.500 --> 53:26.374
No way. If they knew about that,

53:26.417 --> 53:28.999
they would have robbed the restaurant first.

53:29.042 --> 53:30.374
Let's go up and save her.

53:33.667 --> 53:34.874
You

53:34.917 --> 53:37.499
Stay here, I'm going to save her.

53:37.542 --> 53:40.041
Call the police if I'm not back in one hour.
Understand?

53:42.042 --> 53:43.749
What's this for?

53:43.792 --> 53:44.624
I thought you wanted

53:44.667 --> 53:47.124
to have a hot pot together before I leave.

53:49.375 --> 53:50.541
Wait.

54:41.458 --> 54:46.374
Liu Bo.

54:54.250 --> 54:55.791
Freeze!

54:55.875 --> 54:57.291
Who are you?

54:57.333 --> 54:58.791
I'm from the hot pot restaurant.

54:58.833 --> 55:00.124
Hot pot restaurant?

55:09.708 --> 55:10.707
Why are you coming here?

55:10.750 --> 55:12.666
I just wanted to ask you something.

55:12.708 --> 55:14.707
You didn't make it clear.

55:14.750 --> 55:15.666
What?

55:15.708 --> 55:18.582
You only told me to call the police
if you don't come back in an hour.

55:18.625 --> 55:22.082
What if somebody else comes down in an hour?

55:22.125 --> 55:24.124
Fuck off.

55:26.208 --> 55:49.707
Monkey

55:53.750 --> 55:55.499
Boss is calling you.

56:39.208 --> 56:42.124
Why don't you answer?

56:47.375 --> 56:48.707
Speak!

57:05.750 --> 57:07.999
Find the exit yet?

57:52.875 --> 57:53.999
There's one missing.

57:56.125 --> 57:57.582
Stop counting.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.749
Go search for them!

58:04.250 --> 58:06.207
Behave yourselves!

58:39.000 --> 58:41.832
Please let me go.

58:41.875 --> 58:43.291
My dad is rich.

58:43.333 --> 58:45.582
He can give you lots of money.

58:45.625 --> 58:48.457
Please...

58:48.500 --> 58:51.582
Rip her hands off and send them to the police

58:51.625 --> 58:52.332
President.

58:52.375 --> 58:53.832
Please help me.

58:54.875 --> 58:56.707
Please...

58:56.750 --> 59:01.874
Yu Xiaohui, please help me.

59:03.083 --> 59:04.832
Wait.

59:12.833 --> 59:14.374
I know there is another exit in the bank.

59:19.875 --> 59:23.957
I transferred to different schools
a lot when I was little.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.541
Often I did not have

59:25.583 --> 59:27.499
the time to know my classmates.

59:28.250 --> 59:30.791
I had a crush on this one boy in my class.

59:30.833 --> 59:33.457
I wrote him a letter.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.957
But I left right after I gave it to him.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.041
I've never seen him since.

59:38.083 --> 59:39.707
Until a few days ago,

59:39.750 --> 59:44.082
that boy came to me with two other classmates.

59:44.125 --> 59:48.041
They told me that they dug
a hole when they renovated,

59:48.083 --> 59:51.041
and the hole extended into our bank.

59:51.083 --> 59:53.332
Into the bank?

59:53.375 --> 59:58.332
Why come back to work
not run away with the money?

59:58.375 --> 01:00:01.457
We were about to do it today.

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:08.166
I'm not happy working here.

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:11.291
You see, these people

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:14.332
don't like me so much.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.332
When my old classmates showed up,

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:21.332
I thought my life would be different.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:24.832
We would take the money,

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:27.374
start a new life somewhere else.

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.582
But this morning

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:37.541
the boy I had crush on told me

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.624
he decided to quit.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.041
I'll take you to the hole.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:44.457
Take me with you,

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:47.082
but I want half of the money.

01:00:48.833 --> 01:00:50.166
Half.

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.082
And

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.874
lock them in the vault.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.124
so nobody can stop us.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:01.541
Is the hole

01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:04.707
In the vault?

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:07.832
If it's in the vault,

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:10.374
why did the three of them come to me?

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:24.207
You two take the rest of the people to the vault.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:25.707
you,

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:29.749
take me to the hole.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.207
Everyone get up, get up

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.499
Hurry!

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:44.874
Hold on!

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.499
Get down!

01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:57.416
I'm confused.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:02:00.582
You hated your job and the people here.

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:03.291
Why are you protecting them
instead of killing them?

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:05.582
I just want the money not their lives.

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:08.082
Talking about robbing the bank
in front of all of your colleagues.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.041
Aren't you afraid that if you get caught,

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:12.291
there's no chance to withdraw your confession?

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:15.166
They'll hurt you even
if you don't want to hurt them.

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:16.332
How about this.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.624
Let's just kill them all to make things easier.

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:25.457
You are fucking messing me around!

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.582
You just want to save them!

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:28.582
If there's another exit in the bank,

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:31.416
it must be in the vault.

01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:33.207
But

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.916
My buddy just went there.

01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:38.957
There's nothing.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.041
Unless

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:43.249
he lied to me.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.957
Just kidding.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.124
Get that woman here.

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:01.332
Let her go!

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:03.332
Let her go and keep down!

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:04.582
I'll shoot!

01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:10.207
On your knees!

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.624
Liu Bo!

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.457
What are you doing here?

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.374
I'm here to save you.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:17.541
Go to the vault.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:18.957
Four Eyes'll help you down there.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.582
Come on!

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.207
Let's go! To the vault.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:21.832
Go

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:24.041
You two, freeze!

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.832
Don't move!

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:29.582
Freeze!

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:30.707
I'll shoot.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.791
You are really coming to me?

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:35.124
Come on!

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.166
Get down.

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:40.791
Let's go.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:41.957
I'll wait you down there.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:45.082
Don't move.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.624
I'll shoot!

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:52.124
Stop or I'll shoot.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:06.874
What the hell!

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.249
Let him go!

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:15.457
I didn't know he was awake. Sorry.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.499
Fucker!

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.457
Are they cops?

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.207
No.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.957
Just some fuckers who run a hot pot restaurant.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.916
Boss,

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:24.374
there is an exit down there.

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.166
Is this your gun?

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:28.207
Yes.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.707
Okay.

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.082
I count one two three

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.082
you stab him and he shoots me.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:40.582
One.

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:42.374
Liu bo, don't worry about me.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.957
- Two.
- I won't save him.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.541
I'll kill you.

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:49.916
- I'll beat him to death.
- Three

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:50.874
No!

01:04:57.125 --> 01:04:58.124
Okay..

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.749
I let him go.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.166
Suspects inside,

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.166
if you don't respond

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.582
in ten minutes,

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.374
we'll take action.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.874
Suspects inside,

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:50.041
if you don't respond

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.457
Fifty thousand.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.207
My car's really worth such
a little amount of money?

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.874
Where are you?

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.916
Wait for me.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.457
I took the card.

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:32.749
and I'll sell the car.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.457
I'm going to save Liu Bo.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.624
Fine.

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:38.041
Sure you can have your divorce.

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:40.291
Whatever.

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.291
My famous last words,

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.624
I do what I say.

01:07:46.208 --> 01:07:48.374
Bitch.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.957
Boss, we're all set.

01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:55.041
Wait.

01:08:55.457 --> 01:08:57.082
Pull them down first

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:59.832
and make sure that the hole is safe.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.749
I know you.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.707
You do.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.207
Fucking show your

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.249
respect.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:04.582
I...

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:05.999
I know you.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.499
Liu Bo?

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.957
Four Eyes?

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.707
I'm gonna start without you.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.082
Who are you?

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.082
What do you want?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.624
I assume this restaurant
is still under construction ya?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:03.916
Fine.

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:05.124
I'll come back some other day.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.374
I'm here really just for the hot pot.

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.124
If I knew that things would end like this

01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:45.374
I wouldn't have desperately searched for the bag

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:48.166
What's in it?

01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:51.749
The money from the bank.

01:12:51.792 --> 01:12:53.166
and the letter.

01:12:53.292 --> 01:12:56.541
The letter from Yu Xiaohui is also in the bag.

01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.749
We are about to die.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.374
Don't talk nonsense.

01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:05.791
That is exactly the reason
why I'm not talking nonsense.

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:09.791
So the letter was in the bag.

01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:12.499
Actually,

01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:14.249
I have kept that letter.

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:16.499
I didn't bring it up

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:18.499
because I was afraid of you
were gonna make fun of me.

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:22.249
But I'm not afraid now.

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:24.624
I'll die soon anyway.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.124
Yu Xiaohui,

01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:35.124
I really liked you.

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:46.999
Yu Xiaohui,

01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:48.374
I liked you too.

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:00.916
Yu XiaoHui.

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:04.041
I liked you.

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:12.749
I don't wanna see you guys anymore.

01:14:48.667 --> 01:14:50.166
They are fake.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.666
All the guns are fake.

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:00.291
Keep it as a souvenir.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:06.624
Don't you have another one?

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:38.332
You son of a bitch...

01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:40.666
Where are you?

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.416
Here!

01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:28.541
Got backup?

01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:35.291
You take my money...

01:16:38.292 --> 01:16:39.916
Fuck them all!

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:17.791
Liu Bo.

01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:20.249
I remembered.

01:17:20.292 --> 01:17:21.624
There's a knife

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:22.916
in my pocket.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.999
Knife?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.416
We work in the bank!

01:20:20.042 --> 01:20:25.749
Four Eyes!

01:20:26.292 --> 01:20:27.624
Liu Bo!

01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:18.374
You idiot!

01:21:18.417 --> 01:21:19.582
Come Back!

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:20.499
Liu Bo!

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.166
Don't!

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.166
Liu Bo!

01:21:25.042 --> 01:21:25.874
Liu Bo

01:21:26.542 --> 01:21:27.874
Kill him!

01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:30.999
Then we are even.

01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:33.416
Do you hear me?

01:21:34.542 --> 01:21:36.749
I'll pay you back.

01:21:39.375 --> 01:21:40.416
Come back!

01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:43.291
Don't!

01:22:35.542 --> 01:22:36.582
Freeze!

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:37.541
Put your hands behind your head!

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:35.749
Speak!

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:37.749
Why are you chasing me?

01:23:40.042 --> 01:23:42.124
Took my stuff.

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:43.416
I will take it back.

01:27:24.917 --> 01:27:26.541
Liu Bo,

01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:31.249
I have always meant to write to you.

01:27:32.667 --> 01:27:34.707
Thank you for being there

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.374
when I was in danger.

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:41.457
Perhaps you saved me unintentionally.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.874
I believed that

01:27:42.917 --> 01:27:45.082
if you knew that I was in danger,

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:47.582
you would do the same thing.

01:27:47.625 --> 01:27:49.416
Right?

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:53.457
Unfortunately,

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.707
I'm going to transfer to another school.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.624
Maybe

01:27:59.667 --> 01:28:03.374
we won't be able to see each other

01:28:03.417 --> 01:28:05.916
for a long time.

01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:12.082
But I hope that when we meet again

01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:14.249
you will like me too.

01:28:19.667 --> 01:28:22.749
P.S.

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:24.957
Can you stop singing

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.999
'Lost Love Alliance'?

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.999
You are not a loser.

01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:34.166
You are my hero.

01:29:23.417 --> 01:29:24.374
Hero!

01:29:24.417 --> 01:29:27.041
Our boss comes to visit you!

01:29:34.542 --> 01:29:37.457
Here, Let's wish Li Bo
get out of the hospital soon.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:41.416
and also for the success of our
new old mates hot pot restaurant.

01:29:42.542 --> 01:29:44.749
New old mates hot pot restaurant?

01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:46.541
Well.

01:29:46.625 --> 01:29:48.624
Our old one was sealed due to the incident.

01:29:49.167 --> 01:29:50.416
We wanted to open a new one.

01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:53.041
I'm divorced anyway,

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:56.416
now I can totally focus on developing my career.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:57.749
Four Eyes,

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.041
is not going to Beijing anymore.

01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:01.791
What about the money?

01:30:03.417 --> 01:30:05.957
Our rewards from saving the bank.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.999
It should be enough to open a new restaurant.

01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:10.374
I tried my best to right my wrongs

01:30:10.417 --> 01:30:11.749
Don't you guys try to waste the money.

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.832
What do you mean by "waste"?

01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:17.874
It wasn't my fault that the restaurant failed.

01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:19.624
Four Eyes, do you agree?

01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:22.082
Perhaps the three of us
weren't perfectly compatible,

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:24.624
but now there are four of us!

01:30:24.667 --> 01:30:26.374
Four?

01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:29.999
You can't do everything alone.

01:30:30.042 --> 01:30:32.749
So I brought up the idea
of opening the hot pot restaurant

01:30:32.792 --> 01:30:35.124
Four Eyes and Xu Dong are both into it.

01:30:35.167 --> 01:30:36.749
Now it's all up to you.

01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:38.041
Yu XiaoHui

01:30:40.542 --> 01:30:41.874
You should know

01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:45.082
if you fail this time,

01:30:45.125 --> 01:30:47.041
there's no way back.

01:30:51.625 --> 01:30:53.124
All right. I'll take it then.

01:30:53.167 --> 01:30:54.416
Don't worry.

01:30:55.042 --> 01:30:56.499
If there's something wrong,

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:57.874
You three can

01:30:57.917 --> 01:30:59.166
sell yourselves.

01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:00.999
Sell what?

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:02.124
What do you mean?

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:03.624
What?

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:04.999
I mean, 'sell your voices' for a living.

01:31:05.042 --> 01:31:06.874
You are the
'Grasshoppers of Shapingba', aren't you?

01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:10.749
We are too old

01:31:10.792 --> 01:31:12.541
to sing.

01:31:18.417 --> 01:31:19.499
"She always only"

01:31:19.542 --> 01:31:20.999
"leaves me her phone number."

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:22.124
"...tells me"

01:31:22.167 --> 01:31:23.832
"don't give up on her too soon."

01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:25.291
I don't remember the lyrics.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.749
"She always only"

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.999
"leaves me her phone number."

01:31:33.042 --> 01:31:34.124
"but she doesn't want me"

01:31:34.167 --> 01:31:36.374
"to take her home"

01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:38.124
"You said you used to"

01:31:38.167 --> 01:31:39.957
"love her likewise"

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.457
"and falling for her like crazy"

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.457
"you said"

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.999
"you cannot pretend that it didn't matter"

01:31:47.042 --> 01:31:48.124
"but tell me"

01:31:48.167 --> 01:31:50.624
"don't give up on her too soon."

01:31:50.667 --> 01:31:54.124
"Talking about the past as if it was a myth"

01:31:54.167 --> 01:31:57.291
"and laughing at each other for being such fools."

01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:04.904
