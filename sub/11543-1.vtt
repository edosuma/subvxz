02:47:57.984 --> 02:48:00.527
...and that he loves you very much.

02:48:08.495 --> 02:48:09.912
Mail's slow.

02:48:11.498 --> 02:48:13.499
I'm going to have to see about that.

02:48:45.865 --> 02:48:47.366
Your daughter.

02:48:49.536 --> 02:48:51.620
Her name is Hope.

02:49:22.402 --> 02:49:24.903
HOPE:
My father saw how fragile we are...

02:49:25.071 --> 02:49:28.073
...and how quickly we fell
into the hands of tyranny.

02:49:29.284 --> 02:49:31.076
He saw that ordinary men...

02:49:31.244 --> 02:49:34.580
...could reach deep within themselves
and find courage.

02:49:34.914 --> 02:49:38.584
He saw that if we began to communicate
as a nation...

02:49:38.793 --> 02:49:40.711
...we could become strong again...

02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:42.171
...united.

02:49:42.922 --> 02:49:45.257
But he never did see Saint Rose.

02:49:46.843 --> 02:49:48.177
He said...

02:49:48.845 --> 02:49:50.846
...there was too much to be done.

02:49:52.473 --> 02:49:53.974
He'd made a promise.

02:49:54.517 --> 02:49:57.644
And in keeping it,
he traded one dream for another.

02:49:58.271 --> 02:49:59.855
With no regrets.

02:50:03.401 --> 02:50:05.777
And so, in honor of my father...

02:50:44.651 --> 02:50:46.318
That was me.

02:57:45.571 --> 02:57:47.572
