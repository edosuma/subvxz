00:21.120 --> 00:24.455
<i>Mistress, spank my bottom.
Spank it really hard!</i>

00:24.541 --> 00:26.119
<i>Please, spank my bottom!</i>

00:26.294 --> 00:28.453
<i>- That is unpleasant.
- Spank it really hard.</i>

00:29.256 --> 00:30.964
<i>Lick my nipples.</i>

00:31.050 --> 00:32.877
No, thank you, pregnant lady.

00:33.845 --> 00:35.091
<i>Strip, soldier!</i>

00:35.180 --> 00:37.755
<i>You're gonna find out
why they call me the drill sergeant.</i>

01:29.044 --> 01:32.628
That's... That's nice, baby.

01:36.011 --> 01:37.506
No, Frizzy! No!

01:43.146 --> 01:45.020
No, no, no, Frizzy! No!

01:45.357 --> 01:46.389
Frizzy.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.149
No, no, no, wait! Cody! No.

02:11.934 --> 02:12.966
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No!</i>

02:13.061 --> 02:15.552
Don't worry about it, man.
Everyone's got a sex tape.

02:15.647 --> 02:16.727
Please.

02:16.816 --> 02:18.809
Yeah, except they're
having sex with people.

02:19.903 --> 02:20.983
<i>- Frizzy.
- Right.</i>

02:21.071 --> 02:24.821
It's not technically incest if your
family member's a different species.

02:25.076 --> 02:26.702
So, are you getting close with Dana yet?

02:26.787 --> 02:29.326
The rumours are true.
She's taken the pledge.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.954
No sex? She was your sure thing.

02:32.086 --> 02:35.705
- Faith-camp propaganda, man.
- She's waiting until marriage.

02:35.924 --> 02:37.964
I thought she had sex with six guys.

02:42.892 --> 02:44.090
What?

02:45.270 --> 02:46.551
Get to class.

02:47.231 --> 02:48.809
No cell phones in the hall, Alyson.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.273
You can pick this up from my office
today after school.

02:51.361 --> 02:54.945
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!</i>

02:55.367 --> 02:57.111
Well, I've seen worse.

02:59.205 --> 03:00.285
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No!</i>

03:02.251 --> 03:04.410
Miss Johnson. Lunch today?

03:05.338 --> 03:08.590
I'll have to check my
calendar, perv... Pete.

03:12.306 --> 03:15.641
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!</i>

03:15.811 --> 03:17.471
Look. Look. Look at that.

03:18.147 --> 03:21.517
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!</i>

03:23.404 --> 03:27.273
- Hey, just ignore them.
- Oh, God. You saw it, too?

03:28.703 --> 03:31.159
- Just so you know, it's not at all...
- Hey, don't worry about it.

03:31.456 --> 03:34.079
Frizzy's a good-looking dog.

03:35.045 --> 03:38.497
So, do you wanna do it? Are we on?

03:40.135 --> 03:43.172
Rob? Rob? Are we on for seventh period?

03:43.306 --> 03:45.797
Yeah. I... I'll...

03:46.643 --> 03:48.802
- I'll meet you over there.
- Okay.

03:51.358 --> 03:53.316
- Doggy style!
- Hey, Stifler.

03:53.402 --> 03:54.862
Is that your girlfriend?

03:54.946 --> 03:57.319
No, we're just... We're just...
We're friends.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.108
Just friends? How sweet.

04:00.829 --> 04:04.413
Well, she seems awful ripe.
If you don't pick the fruit, I will.

04:05.752 --> 04:07.710
Hey, beautiful.

04:11.927 --> 04:13.006
Wow!

04:14.305 --> 04:17.224
<i>Good morning,
East Great Falls Blazers.</i>

04:17.309 --> 04:20.228
<i>Don't forget about the big game
against Central this week</i>

04:20.313 --> 04:24.395
<i>and the Aloha Dance this Friday
from 7:00 to midnight.</i>

04:24.485 --> 04:28.698
<i>Hawaiian shirts and leis
are recommended for entrance.</i>

04:29.951 --> 04:33.155
<i>- Charles, knock that off.
- Sorry.</i>

04:55.443 --> 04:57.602
Let's focus on the quiz, please.

05:08.627 --> 05:10.122
Douche bag.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.374
I'm serious about this pledge, you know.

05:40.503 --> 05:41.583
I know.

05:41.671 --> 05:44.709
- So just dancing tonight.
- Yeah. Just dancing.

05:45.092 --> 05:46.671
The horizontal hula.

05:46.761 --> 05:48.505
Nathan.

05:55.690 --> 05:56.971
Poor Nathan.

05:57.067 --> 05:59.689
His willy must be hard enough
to cut glass by now.

05:59.779 --> 06:02.152
Nathan loves me, and Nathan respects me.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.489
Okay. A, a guy never respects a girl
enough to give up sex.

06:06.788 --> 06:08.865
And, B, well, what about you?

06:09.166 --> 06:11.954
You must be feeling
pretty randy by now, Dana.

06:12.754 --> 06:15.328
Okay, well, yeah, maybe, like,
the tiniest bit,

06:15.424 --> 06:17.881
but I really feel like I'm connecting
with the higher power here.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.544
Yes, I know, and that is totally fab,

06:20.640 --> 06:24.010
but I know I couldn't do it.
I'm way too into giving blow jobs.

06:24.562 --> 06:26.056
Ask Richard.

06:26.731 --> 06:28.974
Hey, don't listen to lmogen, okay?

06:29.068 --> 06:32.070
Sex is a really big deal,
and if you feel like you're not ready,

06:32.155 --> 06:34.314
then I think you should wait.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.073
But...

06:37.162 --> 06:40.532
No offence, Heidi, but you have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:43.879 --> 06:45.504
Text me later.

06:52.599 --> 06:54.509
- Hey, Rob.
- Yeah?

06:55.019 --> 06:57.226
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What's up?

06:57.313 --> 06:59.307
Well, it's kind of personal.

07:01.277 --> 07:02.523
Okay.

07:03.447 --> 07:07.196
I've been thinking.
You know I'm a virgin, right?

07:08.245 --> 07:09.574
It's just... I don't know.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.989
Everyone's already done it
like a million times already,

07:12.125 --> 07:15.542
and I know I don't have a boyfriend
or whatever, but...

07:16.422 --> 07:18.629
But sometimes I feel like I should just
get it over with.

07:18.717 --> 07:22.930
You know? I mean, just get past
this whole thing, this virgin.

07:23.515 --> 07:25.592
What does that even mean, anyway?

07:25.950 --> 07:29.234
So I've never had a penis in my vagina,
but so what?

07:29.577 --> 07:32.945
<i>Why do I have to label everything?
Like, "She's too innocent.</i>

07:33.038 --> 07:36.038
<i>"She can't handle it:"
I'm not that innocent.</i>

07:36.123 --> 07:38.411
<i>I've seen Showgirls and Blue Lagoon.</i>

07:40.959 --> 07:45.454
Anyways, I think I've decided to
just do it. But what do you think?

07:45.963 --> 07:51.335
Yeah. I think you should definitely
go ahead and get it over with.

07:51.466 --> 07:53.209
Thanks.

07:56.344 --> 07:57.802
Let's get back to work.

08:18.150 --> 08:21.185
Stifcam coming at you live
from the Aloha Dance

08:21.318 --> 08:23.394
here at the East Great Falls...

08:23.903 --> 08:25.480
This chick just grabbed my ass.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.108
She wants to play
the Stifmeister's flute skin.

08:28.198 --> 08:31.032
Let go find some of that
sweet-looking pinoche, Gibbsy.

08:56.174 --> 08:58.082
Hey, check it out. There's Heidi.

08:59.092 --> 09:01.665
All right, all right.
She looks highly doable.

09:02.261 --> 09:04.253
All right, so what's the game plan here?

09:04.346 --> 09:06.254
I don't know. Ask her to dance, I guess.

09:06.347 --> 09:09.797
You need a plan, all right? It's all
about establishing your intentions.

09:09.891 --> 09:12.974
See, right now,
she thinks of you as just a friend.

09:13.268 --> 09:14.809
You need to break that paradigm.

09:14.894 --> 09:18.511
Remember, friends don't let friends
just be friends.

09:18.605 --> 09:21.439
- Right.
- I'm serious. You cannot puss out here.

09:21.523 --> 09:24.191
All right, take it easy.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

09:25.651 --> 09:28.271
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.147
Oh. Oh. Oh.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.987
Here, don't forget these.

09:34.781 --> 09:36.987
You only need those when you're alone.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.277
Right. Right. Okay.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.294
- Okay!
- What? What's wrong?

09:54.377 --> 09:55.657
I can't.

09:55.753 --> 09:58.836
- But it's only second base.
- I know. But if we go there,

09:58.922 --> 10:00.997
then we're gonna wanna go further.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.874
But Adam and Eve did it.

10:05.134 --> 10:07.541
I'm sorry. Hey, hey.

10:07.761 --> 10:10.381
I love you. Do you know that?

10:13.431 --> 10:14.806
Come here.

10:19.268 --> 10:20.512
Is God okay with a blow job?

10:22.770 --> 10:24.976
I thought you understood
how I felt about this.

10:25.063 --> 10:27.849
I told you, it's important for me
to save myself until marriage.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.517
You've had sex with seven guys.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.315
And it was six, not seven!

10:36.529 --> 10:39.101
Well, one was a black guy,
so he counts as two.

10:40.198 --> 10:41.229
Dana.

10:42.366 --> 10:44.239
- Dana, come on.
- Fuck off.

10:44.701 --> 10:47.700
Dana. Come on, Dana. Dana!

10:55.874 --> 10:59.159
Hey, girls.
This is gonna be for Sit-on-my-face-book.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.623
I need you to kiss one time, okay?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.493
I don't know.

11:03.588 --> 11:06.790
Come on.
It's gonna be seen by millions of people.

11:08.216 --> 11:09.330
Okay.

11:13.761 --> 11:15.089
Okay, we're gonna go again,

11:15.178 --> 11:17.964
but this time,
sneak in some tongue for daddy.

11:18.055 --> 11:19.383
Okay.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.474
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

11:31.230 --> 11:33.222
Stifmeister strikes again!

11:35.066 --> 11:36.228
Dude.

11:37.317 --> 11:39.475
You're gonna love this. Check this out.

11:41.903 --> 11:43.397
Yeah. So?

11:43.780 --> 11:45.108
Watch and learn.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.408
<i>"You're hot.</i>

11:51.910 --> 11:57.329
<i>"Give me your number
and let's get together:"</i>

12:00.082 --> 12:02.453
I throw this at a hot girl,

12:02.542 --> 12:05.956
and she's so impressed that I'm
literally throwing around a Benjamin

12:06.085 --> 12:08.373
that she wants to hook up with me.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.999
Yeah. Good luck with that.

12:11.547 --> 12:13.954
- I'm gonna go find Dana.
- All right, man.

12:37.897 --> 12:40.601
Oh, no.

12:40.941 --> 12:42.434
Oh, God.

12:46.111 --> 12:48.779
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Watch out. Coming through.

12:51.114 --> 12:55.193
So, I was thinking about what
we were talking about, you know, before.

12:55.450 --> 13:00.608
- Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
- Right. So I was thinking, why wait?

13:00.870 --> 13:03.621
Right? I mean, you might as well,
you know, get it over with.

13:03.705 --> 13:05.946
What? Like, here? At the dance?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.949
Well, there's always the library.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.793
- Yeah, the library.
- I'm kidding.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.794
- Yeah. I know.
- But seriously, after the dance,

13:13.878 --> 13:14.957
I don't know if you...

13:17.631 --> 13:20.465
- What are you doing?
- Looking for my money.

13:20.924 --> 13:23.130
- C-note thing?
- Yeah.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.508
- Lose your money?
- Shut up.

13:25.803 --> 13:26.917
Ooh.

13:30.931 --> 13:34.595
And we're back. What's up, dude?
Where's Heidi?

13:36.309 --> 13:37.637
I don't know.

13:38.519 --> 13:41.602
- She was here a second ago.
- Maybe she went to the bathroom.

13:41.771 --> 13:44.724
- Yeah, maybe.
- Dana's pissed at me.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.389
Dude, you gotta play along
with this whole pledge thing.

13:47.483 --> 13:49.024
Well, that's easy for you to say.

13:49.109 --> 13:50.816
You haven't exactly
broken the seal yet, either.

13:50.902 --> 13:53.356
Dude, I've been getting to third base
on a regular basis.

13:53.445 --> 13:55.651
I can't go back to jacking off now.

13:55.750 --> 13:59.325
Dude, just use your left hand.
It feels completely different.

14:00.543 --> 14:03.269
- I'm gonna go find Heidi.
- I'm gonna go find Dana.

14:30.450 --> 14:33.245
No! Dude,
you're gonna make me hurl.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.393
Heidi?

14:49.879 --> 14:50.645
No, no, no, no!

14:53.406 --> 14:53.878
Wait.

14:55.971 --> 14:56.721
Dude, yo.

15:13.595 --> 15:14.971
What are you doing?

15:15.847 --> 15:18.091
Rob? You said...

15:18.643 --> 15:19.675
Rob!

15:21.855 --> 15:23.599
Dude, nice cock block.

15:28.446 --> 15:29.822
I'm on fire.

15:30.616 --> 15:32.110
- I'm on fire.
- Oh, my God.

15:32.202 --> 15:35.986
There's a fire. There's a fire,
and it's on me.

15:41.213 --> 15:42.493
Oh, my God.

15:43.340 --> 15:48.133
Rob! Rob! Put it out. Take off your pants!
Take off... Take your pants off!

15:48.430 --> 15:49.758
Oh, God!

15:49.889 --> 15:51.550
Come on!

15:54.186 --> 15:57.058
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:57.148 --> 15:59.639
Hurry, Rob, come on.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.854
Get it out! Get it out!

16:06.951 --> 16:08.031
Oh, God.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.867
What the hell is going on in here?

16:19.759 --> 16:23.294
Two months seems like an awfully long time
for Saturday detention.

16:23.556 --> 16:25.465
We're supposed to clean up the library.

16:26.309 --> 16:28.183
Do you guys know where the vacuum is?

16:28.269 --> 16:29.433
Nope.

16:31.607 --> 16:33.896
What were you doing in the library anyway?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.937
I wasn't doing anything.
Heidi was already in there.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.948
- I was just looking for her.
- I heard she was blowing some dude.

16:40.034 --> 16:44.032
Cody! Well, I don't know
how you're gonna go on the school ski trip

16:44.121 --> 16:45.532
if you're still on detention.

16:45.624 --> 16:48.412
Mom, I don't see what that has to
do with it. I didn't do anything.

16:48.502 --> 16:50.044
I heard you were the fluffer.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.789
- Cody.
- Look. His lips are chapped.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.379
Well, we'll see.

16:56.387 --> 16:58.879
All right. I have to go get ready.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.469
Maybe it's in the garage.

17:07.023 --> 17:10.061
Rob? I wanna have a little chat with you.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.441
Do we have to?

17:11.530 --> 17:14.982
Honey, I know that you're growing older,

17:15.076 --> 17:18.742
and I don't know what your father
has told you about things,

17:18.830 --> 17:21.867
but I think it's important to discuss
everything, you know?

17:21.959 --> 17:23.751
Like about sex.

17:25.672 --> 17:28.247
- Are you having sex?
- Mom, I don't wanna talk about this.

17:28.342 --> 17:33.052
No, well, it's just that I found
this sock in the laundry, and, well...

17:33.515 --> 17:35.923
Oh, God, Mom. Put that away.

17:38.480 --> 17:43.641
And, also,
somebody sent me a link to this video.

17:44.153 --> 17:46.110
<i>No, no, no, Frizzy! No.</i>

17:46.198 --> 17:47.857
- Mom, just turn it off!
- I don't know how!

17:47.949 --> 17:49.575
Your brother made it my start-up screen.

17:49.659 --> 17:51.653
- Okay, I can... I can fix that.
- You can? Great.

17:51.746 --> 17:52.777
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.664
<i>- No, no, no, Frizzy! No!
- Thank you for that.</i>

17:54.749 --> 17:56.374
- Okay.
- And we're done. Right? Yeah.

17:56.459 --> 17:58.785
Well, honey, please.
There's no reason to be ashamed.

17:58.879 --> 18:00.540
Masturbation is perfectly natural.

18:00.632 --> 18:04.582
I mean, boys your age
are maybe into experimentation

18:04.678 --> 18:07.929
and trying new things with animals.

18:08.475 --> 18:12.093
I mean, Frizzy, she's been in our
family for... Since she was a puppy...

18:12.229 --> 18:14.222
Hey, I'm late.

18:24.994 --> 18:27.486
- You're tardy.
- Sorry.

18:28.582 --> 18:30.824
You can start by cleaning off
all the damaged books

18:30.918 --> 18:34.453
and separating the ruined ones.
I'll be checking on you.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.969
Heidi. Look, about last night...

18:40.638 --> 18:42.014
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:43.266 --> 18:45.758
- Well, I just wanted to tell you...
- Rob.

18:48.022 --> 18:49.896
I'm gonna go empty this bucket.

19:40.419 --> 19:42.625
Do you have any idea what I found here?

19:42.714 --> 19:45.205
- This is the bible.
- I thought that was an urban legend.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.672
No. This is real. This goes back decades.

19:47.761 --> 19:49.670
Okay. So what?

19:49.763 --> 19:52.338
This is exactly what we need
to finally get laid.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.592
How is this thing gonna help us get laid?
It's ruined.

19:55.771 --> 19:57.930
You can't even read most of it.

19:58.024 --> 20:00.942
This book has helped one lucky guy
each year at Great Falls.

20:01.153 --> 20:04.273
And this year, that lucky guy is us.

20:04.866 --> 20:08.449
Even with the damage, it still has
a ton of useful stuff. Check this out.

20:09.496 --> 20:12.996
<i>"February 1st, 1977. The G-spot."</i>

20:15.545 --> 20:18.250
- I can dig it.
- What else you got?

20:18.674 --> 20:22.293
<i>"1991 . How to shave your pubes
to make your dick look bigger."</i>

20:22.804 --> 20:24.381
Dad showed me that one.

20:24.472 --> 20:28.601
<i>"2003. I just had
the most amazing sexual experience."</i>

20:28.853 --> 20:32.768
<i>Something I can't read.
"She used a breath mint."</i>

20:33.317 --> 20:35.855
A breath mint? For what?

20:36.320 --> 20:40.817
You moron. You stick it up your tailpipe and
the minty-ness makes your asshole twitch.

20:41.691 --> 20:43.269
Everyone knows that.

20:44.194 --> 20:46.401
Dude, I don't know. This
sounds pretty weak.

20:46.489 --> 20:49.063
Plus, I mean, we can find most of
this stuff on the internet anyway.

20:49.159 --> 20:51.947
No, this is different.
This has personal experiences.

20:52.038 --> 20:54.447
Plus, it's custom-tailored to
Great Falls girls.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.333
Since when does punani have a zip code?

20:56.419 --> 20:59.504
What have we got to lose? Nathan,
you've been working on Dana for, what?

20:59.590 --> 21:03.459
Like six months? Only to find out that
she loves the Lord more than sex?

21:05.348 --> 21:08.599
And, Lube, how have all your schemes
to get laid been working out so far?

21:08.685 --> 21:09.800
Minus $100.

21:09.895 --> 21:14.606
Exactly, and me, well, I've been wasting
all my time on some fantasy that someday...

21:14.693 --> 21:17.861
Heidi's gonna fall madly in love with me.
Face it, guys, we need help.

21:17.989 --> 21:20.481
And this is it, staring
us right in the face.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.365
- I'm in.
- All right.

21:24.123 --> 21:25.321
I'm in.

21:25.499 --> 21:26.531
- Yeah.
- Yes.

21:27.961 --> 21:29.041
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:29.213 --> 21:30.921
Hey, easy. Guys, it's old.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.465
<i>"May 1st, 1990.</i>

21:35.179 --> 21:38.881
<i>"The simplest way into a girl's pants
is still basic flattery."</i>

21:40.436 --> 21:42.892
That's it? Just flatter her?

21:43.190 --> 21:44.934
- That's it.
- Well, think about it.

21:45.026 --> 21:46.900
How many times do you actually do it?

21:47.237 --> 21:50.155
<i>Walk up to a girl and say,
"Wow, you have beautiful eyes."</i>

21:50.241 --> 21:55.035
Like, never. It's telling us the only proven
way to get women is to be an asshole,

21:55.122 --> 21:58.374
'cause the guys that actually spew
that kind of crap get laid.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.952
Check it out. Twelve o'clock.

22:34.675 --> 22:38.544
- All right. Let's put this bible to a test.
- Yes.

22:38.889 --> 22:41.559
- You go talk to her.
- I'm not trying it out on Ashley.

22:41.643 --> 22:44.680
Why don't you go talk to her,
'cause you're the one who likes her?

22:46.024 --> 22:48.266
- I'm eating.
- Okay. I'll do it.

23:20.027 --> 23:22.067
Hey, Ashley.

23:22.155 --> 23:24.195
Hey, Rob. Shopping for your girlfriend?

23:24.283 --> 23:27.618
No... This is... It's for my mom.

23:29.582 --> 23:30.911
She's dating again.

23:44.685 --> 23:48.470
Well, you know, I...
Actually, I wanted to say,

23:49.233 --> 23:53.528
you know,
you have the most gorgeous teeth.

23:58.454 --> 24:01.788
Hey. Come with me.

24:06.214 --> 24:09.216
Jealous? He's making a move
on your lady friend.

24:09.510 --> 24:11.966
Unlike you, I don't mind sharing my women.

24:12.806 --> 24:14.965
And what are
you wankers up to today?

24:15.059 --> 24:16.969
- Cheerio.
- Hello, love.

24:17.062 --> 24:18.093
Word to your mumsie.

24:18.188 --> 24:20.395
Just waiting for some ladies
to join us, in fact.

24:20.483 --> 24:23.105
You nancy boys couldn't get laid
at a Jonas Brothers concert

24:23.195 --> 24:26.814
with a fistful of backstage passes.
Cheerio.

24:29.370 --> 24:30.912
Was that a slam?

24:31.247 --> 24:32.825
You bet your bollocks.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.417
- Hold this.
- Yeah.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.265
How does this look?

24:52.609 --> 24:54.068
Great, I'll take it.

24:55.321 --> 24:56.353
Stand up.

25:00.286 --> 25:03.703
Wait, what... What's... Wait, hold...
Hold on.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.490
Oh.

25:18.477 --> 25:19.806
Should I call you?

25:21.147 --> 25:23.983
Just walk out of the store
and meet me at the food court.

25:26.321 --> 25:27.484
Act natural.

25:55.401 --> 25:56.481
Can I help you?

25:56.569 --> 26:00.900
No. No. I'm... I'm just browsing.

26:03.454 --> 26:04.829
Okay, then.

26:05.248 --> 26:07.704
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

26:14.051 --> 26:17.718
I'm sorry! I wasn't stealing.
It was a... It was a prank.

26:17.806 --> 26:20.808
I am so sorry.
I think we left the tags on your garments.

26:20.894 --> 26:24.727
Please come back to the register.
We'll figure this out. I'm so embarrassed.

26:35.496 --> 26:37.324
Oh, my God.

26:39.085 --> 26:41.292
Sorry, I... I got excited.

26:48.138 --> 26:49.799
That'll be 149.90.

26:51.017 --> 26:53.390
- How much?
- 149.90.

26:54.397 --> 26:55.939
But they're so small.

27:02.866 --> 27:06.782
- Madeleine?
- It's my mom. I'm... I have a note.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.473
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.562
Come again.

27:34.241 --> 27:35.985
What took you so long? Did you get it?

27:36.077 --> 27:40.076
Sure did. I even stole you a bag so you
don't have to touch it till you get home.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.661
Great. Thanks.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.371
Hey. What's up, Ashley?

27:44.505 --> 27:46.415
What are you pillow biters doing here?

27:46.508 --> 27:47.587
Stifler.

27:47.843 --> 27:50.382
Don't eat that. You're gonna get fat.

27:50.471 --> 27:53.639
I'm super horny.
Wanna suck me off in the Sharper lmage?

27:53.851 --> 27:54.966
Okay.

28:10.206 --> 28:13.908
Dana.
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

28:14.045 --> 28:16.750
Didn't mean to disrupt the...
This morning's mass.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.414
What are you doing here?

28:19.719 --> 28:21.712
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

28:22.097 --> 28:25.134
Did you really think that
this is the best time to discuss this?

28:26.228 --> 28:27.936
Well, you weren't answering
any of my texts.

28:30.066 --> 28:32.059
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

28:32.152 --> 28:34.276
<i>What is faith?</i>

28:34.447 --> 28:36.820
<i>When you flip the light switch
in your kitchen,</i>

28:36.908 --> 28:39.317
<i>you know that the light will turn on.</i>

28:39.412 --> 28:44.870
<i>Some might call that faith, but I tell you,
that is not the real faith.</i>

28:45.420 --> 28:49.086
Okay, so what is so important that
you needed to come and interrupt church?

28:49.175 --> 28:50.883
I don't really get why
you're so mad at me right now.

28:50.969 --> 28:55.098
Because you don't respect me.
This is all just a big joke to you.

28:55.266 --> 28:58.767
You know what? You're right,
because this is just another phase for you.

28:58.854 --> 29:00.397
Just like your little stint on yearbook.

29:00.482 --> 29:02.938
You stuck with that for, what,
two weeks before you got bored with it?

29:03.027 --> 29:05.483
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that I wanna

29:05.572 --> 29:06.947
<i>wait until marriage?</i>

29:07.032 --> 29:08.230
<i>Because you slept with Doug Wheeler</i>

29:08.325 --> 29:10.449
<i>and Scott Thompson on the same night.</i>

29:10.537 --> 29:12.613
<i>That doesn't count I was drunk.</i>

29:12.706 --> 29:13.821
Is that Dana?

29:13.916 --> 29:15.791
As soon as you get bored
with this whole pledge thing,

29:16.837 --> 29:18.629
<i>you're just gonna jump right back
in the saddle again.</i>

29:18.798 --> 29:20.921
<i>And when you get to college,
don't even tell me</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:23.845
<i>that you won't be experimenting
with the standard lesbian hookups,</i>

29:23.930 --> 29:26.219
having three-ways, trying anal.

29:27.434 --> 29:28.466
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:28.561 --> 29:29.592
That's what I'm talking...

29:29.687 --> 29:30.933
<i>Fine Just relax.</i>

29:31.106 --> 29:32.137
<i>- Do something!
- Faith is...</i>

29:32.232 --> 29:33.644
- She's your daughter.
- Go!

29:33.734 --> 29:35.359
<i>Faith is the rock-solid...</i>

29:35.445 --> 29:38.363
<i>You don't think I'm committed to this?
My parents waited until marriage.</i>

29:38.449 --> 29:41.617
<i>My dad went to high school with your mom.</i>

29:41.703 --> 29:43.198
<i>He said she blew the whole football team</i>

29:43.289 --> 29:44.664
and had to have her stomach pumped.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.579
<i>Don't be gross, okay?</i>

29:47.878 --> 29:49.373
<i>Plus, your dad was a Beta.</i>

29:49.464 --> 29:51.172
Those guys are notorious poon slayers.

29:52.009 --> 29:54.168
<i>Fuck it! This is bullshit!</i>

29:56.515 --> 29:58.425
You know you want this.

29:59.227 --> 30:00.555
Did we miss communion?

30:02.815 --> 30:03.728
<i>Been a rough go for the...</i>

30:03.816 --> 30:05.061
<i>East Great Falls Blazers in this game.</i>

30:05.151 --> 30:06.527
Go, Blazers!

30:06.611 --> 30:09.946
<i>Which is surprising, since this is
the last home game of the season.</i>

30:10.033 --> 30:12.026
<i>You'd think they'd really
pump up the power there.</i>

30:12.119 --> 30:13.863
Look at him! Watch that guy!
Watch that guy!

30:13.955 --> 30:18.168
<i>Even though it's close to a tie,
we were hoping for better defence from the.</i>

30:18.252 --> 30:21.040
Oh, my gosh, wait.
So, what did your dad say?

30:21.131 --> 30:23.457
He said if he ever sees Nathan
within 100 feet of me,

30:23.551 --> 30:25.627
he's gonna castrate him
with a rusty Garden Weasel.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.422
Oh, no. So what?
Is it over between you guys or what?

30:29.517 --> 30:30.716
I don't know.

30:30.810 --> 30:34.394
Well, if you ever want to try a menage,
you're welcome to join Richard and me.

30:35.859 --> 30:37.104
- No.
- No.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.734
<i>Please don't say
"young boy" around Coach Daly.</i>

30:39.822 --> 30:41.282
<i>Yeah, out here he's.</i>

30:41.366 --> 30:42.742
- What about you, missy?
- What?

30:42.826 --> 30:44.286
How's your sex life?

30:44.370 --> 30:46.992
You guys, I'm gonna go through with it.
I am. I am.

30:47.082 --> 30:50.286
You're so boring.
I would've thought you'd be fielding offers

30:50.378 --> 30:52.418
after your striptease in the library.

30:53.382 --> 30:55.956
Yeah, I'm...
I'm still just waiting for the right time.

30:58.973 --> 31:04.729
Blue and white,
let's go, fight, win. Let's go, fight, win.

31:04.939 --> 31:10.066
Blue and white, let's go, fight, win.
Blazers!

31:10.155 --> 31:13.275
Fight, win.
Blue and white, let's go, fight, win.

31:41.655 --> 31:44.526
I think that is quite enough pictures
of the cheerleaders.

31:44.617 --> 31:47.026
How about we get some of the game?

32:06.146 --> 32:07.641
As you were.

32:12.613 --> 32:13.942
Douche bag.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.026
Blue and white...

32:16.118 --> 32:17.493
<i>Shearson's bringing the ball up court.</i>

32:17.578 --> 32:19.986
<i>He passes it off to Scott Stifler.</i>

32:27.591 --> 32:30.379
<i>Central takes a charge from Shearson.</i>

32:30.470 --> 32:33.555
<i>Time out, Blazers.
What are we gonna do now, Bill?</i>

32:33.933 --> 32:34.965
<i>Ten seconds in the game.</i>

32:35.060 --> 32:36.685
<i>I think these guys
really need to get their act.</i>

32:36.770 --> 32:40.472
Get your head in the game, doggy style.
You can finish your wet dream later.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.359
<i>- I'm sorry.
- This is it for this game.</i>

32:42.444 --> 32:44.438
Hey, Scott? Can I talk to you for a sec?

32:44.531 --> 32:47.201
<i>- Are you nuts? I'm in the middle of a game.
- Last home game of the season.</i>

32:48.452 --> 32:49.615
<i>Really gotta get their act together.</i>

32:51.206 --> 32:55.371
<i>Tie game, 89 all, 3:9 seconds left.
Let's see what's gonna happen here.</i>

32:55.462 --> 32:56.791
<i>- Central's got the ball.
- Go, Blazers!</i>

32:56.880 --> 32:59.633
<i>They have the advantage.</i>

33:00.427 --> 33:01.708
<i>Looks like Double screen!</i>

33:01.804 --> 33:05.008
<i>Shearson gets the ball. He passes it
to Scott Stifler It's good! It's in!</i>

33:06.226 --> 33:09.892
<i>The game's over.
91-89 for East Great Falls Blazers.</i>

33:09.981 --> 33:13.766
<i>This is incredible, folks!
This means we're going on to the playoffs!</i>

33:13.861 --> 33:15.985
<i>Unbelievable! It's exciting.</i>

33:16.657 --> 33:20.276
<i>What a chain of events
that has occurred here today!</i>

33:26.253 --> 33:28.460
Honey, I need to talk to you.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.633
Yeah, sure.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.594
Is... Is that a Bible?

33:33.763 --> 33:35.222
What? No. No, it's...

33:35.307 --> 33:38.344
Well, honey, it's okay to read the Bible.
I mean, gosh, you act like

33:38.436 --> 33:39.467
I caught you reading pornography.

33:41.732 --> 33:43.227
What did you wanna talk about?

33:43.317 --> 33:46.105
Well, I just got
my credit card statement and...

33:46.196 --> 33:49.649
And here on your card
there's a charge here for a lingerie store.

33:50.494 --> 33:53.164
Yeah, I'm...
I'm gonna pay you back for that, Mom.

33:55.041 --> 33:56.666
Is there a girl you're seeing?

33:56.752 --> 33:59.956
No. Mom, it's complicated.

34:01.174 --> 34:03.845
- Did you buy something for yourself?
- No!

34:03.928 --> 34:05.672
Because it's a very normal area
of exploration.

34:05.764 --> 34:09.181
My book says that most fetishes are not
homosexual in nature,

34:09.268 --> 34:11.096
and, well, you know, boys, they tend to...

34:11.188 --> 34:14.806
Yes, Mom, that's it. You figured it out.
I love wearing women's underwear.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.523
Thongs, G-strings,
a little teddy now and then.

34:17.612 --> 34:20.152
It's so soft and silky smooth.
The frillier the better.

34:20.242 --> 34:21.273
Sexy.

34:21.368 --> 34:23.574
Oh, God! Come on.

34:23.663 --> 34:24.694
Gotcha.

34:29.379 --> 34:31.337
So it was for a girl.

34:32.717 --> 34:34.045
Yeah, Mom.

34:34.636 --> 34:35.799
Great.

34:50.364 --> 34:53.367
So, you know that thing
you told me before the dance?

34:53.453 --> 34:54.532
Yeah.

34:54.621 --> 34:57.077
Right, well,
I was thinking about that conversation.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.910
So, what about it?

34:59.127 --> 35:03.173
I was just thinking, you know,
maybe you should wait.

35:04.133 --> 35:07.919
I know. You know, I've
thought about it, too,

35:08.014 --> 35:10.588
but I still feel like
I'm making this whole thing

35:10.684 --> 35:14.849
into, like, this huge deal. I mean,
it's consuming my every thought.

35:18.444 --> 35:20.272
I don't know, Rob.

35:20.363 --> 35:23.781
I still feel like it's best
if I just get it over with.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.866
Yeah. I can see that.

35:30.585 --> 35:32.745
<i>You figured it out.
I love wearing women's underwear.</i>

35:32.838 --> 35:35.164
<i>Thongs, G-strings,
a little teddy now and then.</i>

35:35.258 --> 35:38.011
<i>It's so soft and silky smooth.
The frillier the better.</i>

35:38.095 --> 35:40.303
What is up with this crap, butt nugget?

35:40.390 --> 35:44.306
That was taken completely out of context.
All right? I was being facetious.

35:45.731 --> 35:47.309
That means he wasn't being serious.

35:48.735 --> 35:51.440
I know what facetious means, dick face.

35:51.864 --> 35:54.190
Are you trying to repel
all the pussy in school?

35:54.284 --> 35:55.826
- No...
- Tick tock, doggy boy.

35:55.911 --> 35:57.322
You cock is on the clock.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.659
Excuse me. Take notes.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.968
- Hey, lmogen.
- Stifler.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.927
<i>The word for the day is "legs."</i>

36:11.849 --> 36:12.880
So?

36:12.975 --> 36:16.511
So, why don't we go back to my place
and spread the word?

36:17.440 --> 36:20.014
Well, how about you save your breath?

36:20.277 --> 36:22.566
You're gonna need it
to inflate your date later.

36:27.036 --> 36:29.706
Gentlemen, it is time we got laid.

36:29.831 --> 36:32.240
Really? And what is it
we've been trying to do all this time?

36:32.334 --> 36:37.378
No, no. We need to get laid.
Right here. September 9th, 1995.

36:38.509 --> 36:40.882
Can you give us the executive summary?

36:40.971 --> 36:44.922
No, not that. This.

36:46.937 --> 36:49.892
We are going on a road trip.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.627
How long do you intend
on staying in Canada?

37:11.595 --> 37:13.470
Just a couple of hours.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.094
What's the nature of your visit?

37:16.185 --> 37:19.769
We've driven many miles
in search of vertical smiles.

37:22.151 --> 37:24.061
We use kilometres here.

37:25.697 --> 37:31.572
Then we've driven many clicks
to wet our dicks?

37:32.289 --> 37:33.488
Yes!
Yeah!

37:33.583 --> 37:35.327
- That works, right?
- Bye-bye.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.458
Fucking Americans.

37:42.804 --> 37:45.260
You know, the exchange rate on the dollar
is really gonna help us out.

37:45.349 --> 37:46.380
Yeah.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.136
Okay, up ahead, turn right.

37:48.227 --> 37:49.508
- You sure?
- Yes. Turn right.

38:07.879 --> 38:10.335
Okay, boys. Let's do this.

38:10.424 --> 38:11.966
Are you sure this is a good idea?

38:12.051 --> 38:14.009
Come on, you pussy. Let's get laid.

38:17.350 --> 38:19.390
The bible says to ask for Monique.

38:29.699 --> 38:32.108
Hi. Are you Monique?

38:32.203 --> 38:36.368
<i>No, moi, no, no, no.
Mais, Monique, she is inside.</i>

38:36.834 --> 38:38.293
Come. Come, boys.

38:45.387 --> 38:49.220
<i>Boys, entrez chez nous.</i>

38:49.309 --> 38:54.138
<i>C'est magnifique, no?
I will get Monique.</i>

38:54.399 --> 38:58.647
She will be so happy to see you.

38:58.738 --> 39:01.657
In the meantime, make yourselves at home.

39:05.163 --> 39:08.082
Jesus, tits. We came to the right place.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.288
Is that a moose?

39:10.754 --> 39:11.953
Condom?

39:12.590 --> 39:14.916
Why, thank you.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.267
Gentlemen.

39:20.634 --> 39:21.496
Thank you.

39:22.341 --> 39:23.201
Very much.

39:24.197 --> 39:24.837
Thank you.

39:28.102 --> 39:29.330
Can't wait to see Monique.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.210
We're here to see Monique.

39:50.602 --> 39:53.250
I am Monique.

39:54.187 --> 39:58.380
Oh!... Well, that's... That's okay.

39:59.334 --> 40:04.024
Come, come. I make you a nice drink.

40:26.119 --> 40:29.148
Yeah, could you just
give us just one minute?

40:32.620 --> 40:34.805
This could be very
educational for all of us.

40:36.116 --> 40:36.770
Really?

40:44.903 --> 40:47.491
- He's up.
- No, no. Why am I first?

40:47.561 --> 40:48.685
It was your idea.

40:49.367 --> 40:52.113
Don't... Don't insult Monique.
She has an entire chapter in the bible.

40:53.402 --> 40:55.524
You two crazy kids have fun.

41:18.470 --> 41:20.004
And welcome.

41:24.002 --> 41:27.194
So... So, how does this work?
Am I supposed to pay you?

41:27.935 --> 41:29.340
No, no, no. Not yet.

41:36.691 --> 41:38.327
Oh, I see.

42:34.015 --> 42:36.503
You've got one active imagination, boy.

42:40.759 --> 42:41.877
How long was I out for?

42:42.859 --> 42:44.222
Only about eight seconds that time.

43:03.108 --> 43:06.451
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No. No. No, no, no.

43:06.820 --> 43:09.096
Yes. Yes.

43:15.275 --> 43:19.321
Monique! Oh! That's really nice.

43:32.556 --> 43:33.883
That's it.

43:40.430 --> 43:43.925
I'm so sorry. I usually last a lot longer.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.001
Hey.

43:47.595 --> 43:51.091
Hey, was I supposed to
tap you on the shoulder or something?

43:53.303 --> 43:54.925
Oh, no. No.

43:56.427 --> 44:00.207
Help! Help! Help, help, help!

44:01.051 --> 44:03.421
Go, go, go! Go!
I'm coming!

44:05.301 --> 44:06.462
- Jesus. Dude.
- Oh, God!

44:06.550 --> 44:07.829
What, do you need an audience?

44:07.925 --> 44:09.667
No, no. Wait, guys. I think she's dead!

44:10.258 --> 44:11.336
Excuse me?

44:11.425 --> 44:13.214
Oh, my God. This is not good.

44:13.299 --> 44:15.918
I can't get her off.
I think she had a heart attack.

44:16.007 --> 44:18.081
Help! She's got lockjaw. Get her off of me!

44:18.173 --> 44:20.413
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's lockjaw.

44:20.506 --> 44:23.504
Lockjaw! Lockjaw, lockjaw, lockjaw,
lockjaw, lockjaw!

44:23.589 --> 44:25.247
- Okay.
- Get her off!

44:29.255 --> 44:30.534
I'm sorry!

44:32.671 --> 44:36.711
Phone. Phone. Wait. Clear!

44:38.628 --> 44:40.286
Shit. What am I doing?

44:40.378 --> 44:42.036
Clear, clear!

44:45.377 --> 44:49.915
Okay. Come down here.
Grab her legs. One, two, three.

44:52.043 --> 44:55.040
Forget it. It's totally screwed up.
Oh, God.

44:58.375 --> 45:00.164
<i>What you do to maman?</i>

45:08.915 --> 45:12.659
<i>Maman! You killed maman!
You killed maman!</i>

45:29.412 --> 45:34.862
Fucking Americans! Come back here.
I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you cowards!

45:37.369 --> 45:38.742
I killed her.

45:38.827 --> 45:40.616
I killed her with my sperm!

45:40.701 --> 45:43.782
Hey, man, when it's your time to go,
it's your time to go. She led a full life.

45:43.868 --> 45:44.898
How do you know that?

45:44.992 --> 45:47.232
Man, what do you want me to say?
You're the one that murdered her!

45:47.325 --> 45:50.904
I can't believe that was the woman
the bible said we should have sex with.

45:50.991 --> 45:54.522
<i>Right here: "September 9th, 1995."</i>

45:55.366 --> 45:56.739
Let me see that.

45:57.740 --> 46:03.736
No. No, that's a seven!
That's 1975. It's from the '70s.

46:04.197 --> 46:06.401
- I thought it was a nine.
- Shut up! Shut up!

46:06.489 --> 46:11.062
- I didn't do anything!
- Shut up! Just shut up! I wanna go home.

46:11.155 --> 46:12.351
I don't wanna be here.

46:13.613 --> 46:15.733
Oh, my God! I just hit a squirrel.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.609
Well, that went well.

46:21.091 --> 46:23.420
Guys, I think it's time
we try my interpretation.

46:23.513 --> 46:26.636
Look, Nathan, you've been trying to
convince Dana to sleep with you,

46:26.728 --> 46:28.889
instead of just listening to her.
Right, you know?

46:28.983 --> 46:32.022
Trying to see things from her
point of view? Showing just...

46:32.115 --> 46:34.109
Just a little respect.

46:34.202 --> 46:37.123
And you, you're still trying
to trick women into sleeping with you,

46:37.292 --> 46:39.251
instead of just being honest.

46:39.756 --> 46:43.093
And you're still too much of a pussy
to tell Heidi you're into her.

46:52.366 --> 46:54.491
You going to Stifler's house tonight?

46:54.579 --> 46:56.954
Yeah. I'll probably go with Dana.

46:57.084 --> 47:00.623
So any luck losing that thing you were
trying to get rid of?

47:00.717 --> 47:03.127
- Rob.
- I'm just asking.

47:03.222 --> 47:05.347
Maybe you should mind your own business.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.986
What's with you today?

47:20.885 --> 47:24.803
I wanna tell you something that
I've been wanting to say for a long time.

47:24.893 --> 47:25.974
Okay.

47:31.198 --> 47:32.860
I really like you.

47:33.495 --> 47:35.536
I really like you, too.

47:36.250 --> 47:41.381
No, not like that. I really like you.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.673
Oh.

47:46.939 --> 47:48.221
- Rob...
- I think you're great.

47:48.609 --> 47:53.361
You have a great personality.
I laugh at all your jokes. You're pretty.

47:53.453 --> 47:58.168
Oh, God, you're pretty.
You even smell great.

47:59.884 --> 48:03.054
I don't know. I'm just...
I'm happy when I'm around you.

48:03.141 --> 48:04.969
Now, I don't know if you feel the same way,
but if you do...

48:05.061 --> 48:07.056
Let's not waste any more time. Right?
Let's just

48:08.152 --> 48:10.526
see where our feelings take us.

48:14.373 --> 48:16.035
I feel the same way.

48:17.212 --> 48:19.290
- You do?
- Yes.

48:19.383 --> 48:22.589
This is great.
Why didn't you say something?

48:22.682 --> 48:24.177
Why didn't you?

48:27.651 --> 48:33.327
It's about that time, so I gotta go.
But I'll see you tonight?

48:34.164 --> 48:35.245
Yes.

48:55.042 --> 48:56.123
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

48:56.879 --> 48:58.340
There she is.

49:06.191 --> 49:08.981
They saw me!
Get down! Get down!

49:12.663 --> 49:14.704
- Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.
- Drive. Drive.

49:14.792 --> 49:16.586
It's cool. It's cool.

49:17.715 --> 49:20.755
Nathan, look, I've been thinking.

49:21.932 --> 49:23.642
Maybe I've been too hard on you.

49:24.479 --> 49:25.761
You have?

49:26.024 --> 49:29.860
You obviously love my daughter,
and you two should be together.

49:30.869 --> 49:33.409
- We should?
- Absolutely.

49:33.958 --> 49:37.746
Honey, it is not right
to give a man blue balls.

49:37.841 --> 49:42.758
If you want boys to like you, you gotta
put out. Here, start with Nathan's friend.

49:54.793 --> 49:56.171
This is so not cool.

49:56.255 --> 49:58.831
I mean, fantasizing about
your best friend's girlfriend?

50:00.180 --> 50:02.092
Oh, my God!

50:04.040 --> 50:05.480
- Dad! Stop! Stop.
- Fucknut!

50:31.433 --> 50:32.758
All right, girls.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.417
- Party looks good.
- Yeah.

50:35.452 --> 50:36.007
Uh-huh.

50:37.274 --> 50:38.618
All right, listen to me. Stay focused.

50:40.001 --> 50:43.082
Be honest, show respect
and just say whatever's on your mind.

50:43.409 --> 50:44.383
Stop, jerk.

50:44.670 --> 50:45.537
I can't even get near Dana.

50:45.572 --> 50:46.986
She'll be here. She's coming with Heidi.

50:47.154 --> 50:49.426
Just try and think of things
from her point of view.

50:49.671 --> 50:52.237
Yeah, and I might as well just crack
the Da Vinci Code while I'm at it.

50:52.683 --> 50:54.050
Just get her some frankincense and myrrh.

50:54.633 --> 50:55.629
That's a great idea.

50:55.994 --> 50:57.752
I'll just pick up some roofies for you
while I'm out.

50:58.466 --> 51:00.695
You need a prescription for that,
from what I hear.

51:01.546 --> 51:03.404
Lube, pay attention. This
applies to you, too.

51:03.615 --> 51:07.084
All right.
Let's try to go in there and just be real.

51:08.251 --> 51:09.237
All right, Oprah.

51:35.716 --> 51:37.946
Hey. Isn't that that chick from Central?

51:40.218 --> 51:40.866
Yeah.

51:41.579 --> 51:42.681
Hey, Stifler.

51:43.452 --> 51:44.391
Oh, hey, there...

51:45.566 --> 51:46.347
Katie.

51:47.016 --> 51:50.061
Katie, right. I knew that.
Just having some fun with you.

51:50.844 --> 51:54.406
Can I talk to you for a second,
like, in private?

51:55.120 --> 51:56.490
Yeah, sure, you know what?

51:56.628 --> 51:58.917
Let me just grab another beer
and I'll be right back with you.

51:59.655 --> 52:00.722
Don't you flake on me.

52:03.595 --> 52:05.702
Dude, you been working out?
Didn't think so.

52:06.661 --> 52:09.596
You two, stay amazing. My God.

52:13.440 --> 52:14.592
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

52:15.304 --> 52:17.483
You know, I got so drunk last weekend

52:17.550 --> 52:20.018
that I nailed my cock to a table,
then set it on fire.

52:21.126 --> 52:22.621
Wanna check it out?

52:22.711 --> 52:24.586
The table or your cock?

52:24.881 --> 52:26.790
God, I love that accent.

52:26.883 --> 52:28.710
Could you do me a favour and just say,

52:28.802 --> 52:32.635
<i>"Spank me, Stifler.
Spank me wee little bum."</i>

52:33.934 --> 52:36.556
How did you know I like to be spanked?

52:37.438 --> 52:39.680
Awesome!

52:40.817 --> 52:44.650
So where's this boyfriend Richard you keep
talking about non-stop all the time?

52:44.739 --> 52:47.277
He doesn't attend high-school parties.

52:47.367 --> 52:51.911
Sounds like you might be in the market
for some home-grown American beef.

52:51.998 --> 52:53.623
Sorry, I'm vegan.

52:54.710 --> 52:55.908
Cheers.

52:59.090 --> 53:00.964
What if I use a cucumber?

53:03.994 --> 53:06.730
All right, boys. Tonight's the night.
Wish me luck.

53:07.093 --> 53:08.156
Good luck, buddy.

53:08.191 --> 53:10.358
Good luck, dude.
Tonight, you become a man.

53:10.639 --> 53:12.544
That's it. Tonight, I'm getting laid!

53:12.579 --> 53:14.208
- Yeah, buddy! Yes!
- Yeah, buddy.

53:14.633 --> 53:16.611
- Yes!
- Right here.

53:16.978 --> 53:18.439
Just give it to her nice and slow at first.

53:18.979 --> 53:19.812
Then speed her up.

53:21.026 --> 53:21.930
D.. Dana!

53:22.965 --> 53:23.541
Dana!

53:25.082 --> 53:26.072
Yeah!

53:29.265 --> 53:31.096
Yeah! Woooh!

53:31.311 --> 53:33.040
- What?
- Sorry.

53:36.521 --> 53:39.048
- I can't find Heidi anywhere.
- Maybe she didn't come.

53:39.371 --> 53:40.709
No, no. Her car is outside.

53:42.631 --> 53:43.288
How you making out?

53:43.851 --> 53:44.444
Check it out.

53:46.956 --> 53:50.240
Don't you think maybe Ashley's
just a little bit out of your league?

53:50.990 --> 53:53.491
I don't know. I'm just saying, you know,
you've been at it for years.

53:55.113 --> 53:56.572
Maybe it's just not in the cards for you.

53:57.412 --> 53:58.557
I'm a man of refinement.

53:59.006 --> 54:01.738
Why settle for a six
when you can get a perfect 10?

54:05.432 --> 54:08.344
Okay, whatever you say, man. Good luck.

54:10.328 --> 54:11.637
I'm gonna do it.

54:12.787 --> 54:13.997
Hey, what's up, Ashley?

54:14.850 --> 54:15.926
Hey, Lube.

54:16.285 --> 54:17.259
You want a beer?

54:18.165 --> 54:19.359
Got a beer.

54:19.504 --> 54:20.513
Right.

54:22.186 --> 54:23.301
So...

54:26.275 --> 54:29.977
You obviously know that I'm,
like, totally into you. Right?

54:30.239 --> 54:31.817
Yeah. I've seen the shrine.

54:34.245 --> 54:35.870
All right.

54:36.831 --> 54:40.534
Okay, so I'm just gonna be honest with you.
I'm just gonna lay it out on the line.

54:40.628 --> 54:43.120
No tricks, no hidden agenda at all.

54:44.551 --> 54:47.672
I happen to be a sensitive
and expert lover.

54:52.478 --> 54:56.180
I can guarantee that I will satisfy you
in every way possible,

54:56.275 --> 54:58.483
and I shall not stop until I'm certain

54:58.570 --> 55:01.857
that you are completely happy
with my endeavours.

55:06.164 --> 55:07.279
Okay.

55:15.552 --> 55:20.797
Look, that was a really interesting speech,

55:20.893 --> 55:25.023
and I don't really wanna embarrass you
in front of everyone, but...

55:25.817 --> 55:27.727
But it's not gonna happen.

55:27.819 --> 55:31.320
I mean, I think that you're,
like, really super cool,

55:31.408 --> 55:33.200
and you're really funny in class
and everything,

55:33.285 --> 55:36.038
but I don't wanna have sex with you.

55:36.915 --> 55:37.995
Okay?

55:38.459 --> 55:40.334
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

55:41.714 --> 55:44.170
- So are we cool?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

55:44.509 --> 55:45.708
All right.

55:45.803 --> 55:47.381
Well, I'm gonna go get another beer.
Do you want one?

55:47.472 --> 55:50.142
No, no. I'm... I'm good. I'm good.

55:54.982 --> 55:56.774
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:57.027 --> 56:00.029
What you said just now?

56:00.323 --> 56:01.438
Yeah?

56:01.575 --> 56:03.118
Was that true?

56:03.703 --> 56:09.209
Guaranteed satisfaction and you won't stop
until a girl is completely satisfied?

56:10.379 --> 56:11.458
Yeah.

56:13.133 --> 56:15.803
All right. Well, what the hell.

56:16.512 --> 56:19.717
Meet me upstairs
in the first bedroom to the left.

56:32.910 --> 56:35.782
The truth is, yes,
I was trying to pressure you,

56:35.873 --> 56:38.626
because I really, really wanna have sex.

56:38.752 --> 56:42.798
But I really wanna have sex with you.

56:43.759 --> 56:47.628
And, also, I mean, with us,
hooking up has always been about me.

56:49.767 --> 56:54.098
I wanna forget myself for once
and try to make you feel good for a change.

56:54.190 --> 56:59.103
Like, maybe try and make you feel
the way that you make me feel.

57:08.024 --> 57:09.056
Oh!

57:21.549 --> 57:22.581
Oh.

57:23.719 --> 57:26.343
You shouldn't... You shouldn't...
It's my phone.

57:26.433 --> 57:27.892
Don't read my phone.

57:27.978 --> 57:32.442
<i>What's this supposed to mean?
"Give her a dose of manthrax"?</i>

57:32.653 --> 57:33.685
Well, I don't... What does that...

57:33.779 --> 57:35.608
I don't know what that...
Do you know what that means?

57:35.700 --> 57:37.610
<i>"I'm getting laid"?</i>

57:38.789 --> 57:41.116
You're advertising this
before it even happens?

57:41.211 --> 57:42.290
- No.
- Wow.

57:42.380 --> 57:44.753
You must be some special kind of asshole.

57:44.842 --> 57:47.131
No. No, no, no! No. I didn't... It was...

57:48.348 --> 57:49.808
Later, loser.

57:54.777 --> 57:58.907
Faster. Okay. Now, slower. Yes, yes.

57:59.243 --> 58:01.997
Slower. Tickle the bunny. Yes, yes.

58:02.082 --> 58:04.621
Oh, God, the man in the boat is out.

58:04.712 --> 58:07.039
Paddle, paddle, do the alphabet. Swirl.

58:07.132 --> 58:10.755
Back to the bunny. That's it.
Okay. Now, more to the left.

58:11.182 --> 58:12.843
More to the left!

58:13.102 --> 58:14.812
- My left or your left?
- My left, my left, my left!

58:14.897 --> 58:15.929
All right.

58:17.693 --> 58:19.688
Hey, have you seen Heidi?

58:20.448 --> 58:21.647
Thanks.

58:23.246 --> 58:24.526
Hey, Rob.

58:26.334 --> 58:27.533
Heidi?

58:28.589 --> 58:32.006
Hey, doggy style.
I told you, you snooze, you lose.

58:32.095 --> 58:35.550
So unless you want mop-up duty,
close the door, pervert.

58:46.246 --> 58:47.411
Hey, where are you going?

58:47.498 --> 58:49.707
This was a horrible idea.

58:57.016 --> 58:58.891
Rob? Excuse me.

59:00.146 --> 59:03.898
Excuse me. Rob. Rob.

59:04.821 --> 59:06.566
- Go away.
- I didn't. I...

59:06.659 --> 59:09.235
I don't wanna see your face right now.

59:10.124 --> 59:11.238
Rob.

59:24.358 --> 59:26.352
Whoa, whoa.

59:26.528 --> 59:27.609
What are you doing?

59:27.697 --> 59:31.781
What happened to forgetting about yourself
and making me feel good?

59:32.581 --> 59:34.290
But I thought I just...

59:34.377 --> 59:35.871
What? You thought that what, Nathan?

59:35.963 --> 59:39.299
That you could just pretend that you cared
about my feelings and my pledge

59:39.385 --> 59:42.305
and then just go
and try again when my guard was down?

59:42.391 --> 59:44.682
No. You don't get it. I...

59:44.770 --> 59:47.808
No. No, you're the one
that's not gonna get it.

59:58.504 --> 01:00:01.210
Dude, you need to slow down.

01:00:01.302 --> 01:00:03.590
Yeah, seriously. Let's just go home.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.183
You, sir...
You, sir, were right about the bible.

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:10.770
Because assholes get laid!

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:13.060
Yes.

01:00:15.576 --> 01:00:18.533
No. No, no, dude. You were right.

01:00:18.874 --> 01:00:21.034
- There's something to it.
- What are you talking about?

01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:24.750
We tried the nice guy thing
and I believe we're all still virgins.

01:00:24.844 --> 01:00:28.215
Well, the nice guy vibe got me
past the bouncer, man.

01:00:28.934 --> 01:00:30.049
Hey.

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:40.528
Well, gentlemen, you failed, and the
proof, as they say, is in the Jell-o.

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:44.035
So I will see you later, nice guys.

01:00:47.803 --> 01:00:49.677
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:49.973 --> 01:00:51.552
I know you want me.

01:00:51.642 --> 01:00:54.931
I'm gonna let you take me upstairs
and do me right now.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:58.901
Kiss me.

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:05.289
Y'all ready for some pain?

01:01:09.759 --> 01:01:11.718
Hey, ladies.

01:01:20.863 --> 01:01:22.275
Oh, my God.

01:01:22.866 --> 01:01:24.446
Oh, my God!

01:01:24.954 --> 01:01:26.782
Look at those taters!

01:01:35.682 --> 01:01:37.392
Do me from behind.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:38.843
What?

01:01:40.483 --> 01:01:42.976
I thought you liked it doggy style.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.818
Huh?

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.039
What are you doing back there? Let's go.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.385
You're not putting your dick in that,
are you?

01:01:58.725 --> 01:02:01.300
Are you kidding me? Gross.

01:02:23.227 --> 01:02:24.973
Here. This'll help.

01:02:25.273 --> 01:02:26.472
Thanks.

01:02:27.403 --> 01:02:30.821
Honey, I know that I can't stop you
from doing certain things,

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:34.078
but I can insist that you are safe.

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:36.250
Did you drink and drive?

01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:38.828
No. John Costello drove me home.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:44.630
Well, I want you to know that if
you find yourself in any carnal situation,

01:02:44.726 --> 01:02:47.266
that you... You will use protection.

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.767
What do you mean by carnal?

01:02:52.448 --> 01:02:53.480
This.

01:02:58.585 --> 01:03:00.378
<i>Are you kidding me? Gross.</i>

01:03:00.462 --> 01:03:02.541
Is there no such thing as privacy any more?

01:03:02.633 --> 01:03:06.385
I will tell your father that
you're just not up to seeing him today.

01:03:06.475 --> 01:03:08.384
You're not feeling well.

01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:10.474
Thanks.

01:03:14.197 --> 01:03:15.657
How was she?

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.023
- How was who?
- Vomit girl.

01:03:19.407 --> 01:03:20.487
How do you know about that?

01:03:20.575 --> 01:03:23.909
Who do you think is forwarding
all those videos to Mom?

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:30.583
I'm ready to give up.

01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:32.289
I thought I had the answers.

01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:36.079
It's too bad that 99% of the bible's
completely unreadable.

01:03:38.009 --> 01:03:39.338
That's it.

01:03:40.053 --> 01:03:42.176
We need to reconstruct the bible.

01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:43.343
Why?

01:03:43.431 --> 01:03:44.842
The secrets are in there.

01:03:44.933 --> 01:03:47.850
I mean, there's no one single answer
to getting laid.

01:03:47.936 --> 01:03:49.893
Right? We need the whole book
to understand.

01:03:49.979 --> 01:03:52.056
Probably has a lot of crap in there
that we need to know, too,

01:03:52.148 --> 01:03:55.149
like positions, techniques,
angle of insertion.

01:03:55.235 --> 01:03:59.446
Exactly. That's what the bible was
created for, to help guys like us.

01:03:59.614 --> 01:04:02.734
And we owe it to the others.
I ruined the bible.

01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:05.614
I owe it to future generations
to restore its wisdom.

01:04:05.703 --> 01:04:08.455
Dude, I'm all for it, but how?

01:04:14.462 --> 01:04:16.122
Where do we start?

01:04:18.174 --> 01:04:19.882
From the beginning.

01:04:20.343 --> 01:04:22.134
This must be the guy
who created the bible.

01:04:27.308 --> 01:04:28.506
Hello?

01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:31.388
<i>Hi: May I speak
to Noah Levenstein, please?</i>

01:04:31.479 --> 01:04:32.510
Speaking.

01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:34.931
Are you the one who created the bible?

01:04:36.276 --> 01:04:38.683
No, that would be God.

01:04:38.862 --> 01:04:40.688
<i>No, no, no: Hold on.</i>

01:04:40.989 --> 01:04:44.322
I'm referring to the bible.

01:04:45.243 --> 01:04:46.986
<i>I'm calling from
East Great Falls High School.</i>

01:04:50.206 --> 01:04:54.251
It was the summer
of my junior year, 1969,

01:04:54.335 --> 01:04:57.087
and my buddies and I,
we take this trip to Amsterdam,

01:04:57.171 --> 01:05:01.086
where we run into a group
of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

01:05:01.175 --> 01:05:05.387
who were willing to trade their bodies
for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.

01:05:05.471 --> 01:05:09.968
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
one super weekend with those gals,

01:05:10.184 --> 01:05:12.889
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

01:05:13.688 --> 01:05:16.558
But the sad news was,
we had no idea what we were doing.

01:05:16.649 --> 01:05:18.393
We had no technique.

01:05:18.776 --> 01:05:21.528
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

01:05:21.612 --> 01:05:24.566
and we run into this Dutch hooker
in the red-light district,

01:05:24.657 --> 01:05:27.065
and she tells us about this book.

01:05:28.244 --> 01:05:33.286
It was a sex manual, evidently written
in the 19th century by some priest.

01:05:33.374 --> 01:05:35.746
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

01:05:35.835 --> 01:05:38.291
and then when we got back
to East Great Falls,

01:05:38.379 --> 01:05:41.131
I had the bright idea to write my own book

01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:45.260
and add my own observations
and experiences and advice

01:05:45.344 --> 01:05:49.259
and leave it in the library for some
other hapless virgin in the class below us.

01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:53.429
But I had no idea it had been
passed down for 40 years.

01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:56.266
Your book is a legend, Mr Levenstein.

01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:00.269
Do you have it here?

01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:01.439
Yeah.

01:06:01.527 --> 01:06:03.187
May I see it?

01:06:07.033 --> 01:06:08.195
Oh.

01:06:08.576 --> 01:06:09.774
Oh, my.

01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:12.408
Boys.

01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:16.869
This is a real piece of history here.

01:06:17.585 --> 01:06:19.376
What happened to it?

01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:21.289
Well, that's why we're here.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.625
The bible kinda got ruined,

01:06:22.715 --> 01:06:26.665
so we wanna call everyone on the list
and try to reconstruct it.

01:06:27.803 --> 01:06:29.048
Oh.

01:06:30.139 --> 01:06:34.053
Well, I think you boys might need
some help.

01:06:36.062 --> 01:06:39.976
Well, girls have the advantage,
because girls talk to each other,

01:06:40.066 --> 01:06:42.770
and don't kid yourself,
they talk about the penis.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.276
Penis size, penis shape,
the angle of the bend.

01:06:46.614 --> 01:06:48.322
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

01:06:48.407 --> 01:06:52.322
Now, to really make love to a woman,
you gotta really care about her.

01:06:52.411 --> 01:06:56.361
But... Hey, sex is great, but sex with
someone you love? That's awesome.

01:06:56.457 --> 01:06:58.200
Dude, that is so profound.

01:06:58.292 --> 01:06:59.455
Telling you.

01:06:59.543 --> 01:07:01.417
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

01:07:01.504 --> 01:07:04.042
Sure, I made love to all kinds
of different food groups.

01:07:04.131 --> 01:07:06.338
Did you ever try making love
to a peanut-butter sandwich?

01:07:06.425 --> 01:07:07.706
Nothing comes close.

01:07:07.802 --> 01:07:08.881
What?

01:07:08.969 --> 01:07:13.216
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock,
but that takes a whole lot of prep.

01:07:13.808 --> 01:07:14.887
Bend your knees.

01:07:14.975 --> 01:07:17.763
Next time you spank it, sit Indian-style.

01:07:17.978 --> 01:07:19.722
You won't come, not in a million years.

01:07:19.814 --> 01:07:22.518
Our sex organs
are like musical instruments.

01:07:22.608 --> 01:07:24.517
Sure, you can have any technician
blow on your horn,

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.694
but to place your instrument into
the hands of a true expert?

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.485
That, my young friend, is true harmony.

01:07:30.574 --> 01:07:32.531
Guys don't talk to each other

01:07:32.618 --> 01:07:34.527
because they view each other
as competitors,

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.328
which I think is crazy. You know?

01:07:36.413 --> 01:07:39.865
Because men need to help each other
and work together to get laid.

01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:42.249
<i>Noah Levenstein, class of '70.</i>

01:07:42.336 --> 01:07:45.041
<i>Pete Sambrelli?
That's right, the Noah Levenstein.</i>

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.162
<i>Do you have a number for him?</i>

01:07:46.257 --> 01:07:48.712
<i>Hi: This is regarding his advice
on the lubricants.</i>

01:07:48.801 --> 01:07:52.004
We found the tongue tornado in Regina.

01:07:53.389 --> 01:07:55.595
You said bros befo' hos.

01:07:55.683 --> 01:07:59.680
Isn't that what you said? Bros befo' hos.
And then you screwed my girlfriend.

01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:02.806
Well, so did the entire glee club, Carlito.
What's your point?

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:09.031
It's all about chemistry,
and confidence is the key.

01:08:13.285 --> 01:08:15.953
<i>R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
you've heard that song, right?</i>

01:08:16.036 --> 01:08:17.778
Boys, we got another confirmation.

01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:19.447
You gotta treat your lady right.

01:08:19.537 --> 01:08:24.361
You've got to be gentle, kind
and respectful to the one you love.

01:08:24.788 --> 01:08:27.112
- Who are you talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:27.206 --> 01:08:29.031
This is how you get her really excited.

01:08:29.122 --> 01:08:32.490
Stick your finger in her ass. Trust me.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:34.828
Was that two fingers or one?

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.415
I'm sorry.
Confidential matter.

01:08:38.959 --> 01:08:40.618
Phone, phone. Okay.

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.240
Then what happened?

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:45.417
Hello. Yeah. Class of '77.

01:08:45.502 --> 01:08:47.044
Yeah, hold on. Let me get a pen.

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.242
Pete O'Donnell, please.

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:50.412
Who is this?

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:54.460
Mr O'Donnell, this is Marshall Lubetski.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.380
I just wanted to talk to you about
what you wrote in the bible.

01:08:57.464 --> 01:09:01.459
You know, about having anal sex
with Miss Johnson.

01:09:13.635 --> 01:09:16.469
...very much! Mark S.!

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.635
This is not a sex manual.

01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:33.510
It is a life manual.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.712
Now, I've been married for 35 years

01:09:37.809 --> 01:09:41.341
and not just because
I'm this handsome dude

01:09:41.435 --> 01:09:43.805
who knows how to satisfy a woman.

01:09:43.977 --> 01:09:48.054
I've been married 35 years
because I love my wife

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:51.060
and I respect my wife.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.063
And whether it's Amsterdam
or East Great Falls,

01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:55.853
it all comes down to this.

01:09:55.939 --> 01:09:59.804
If you're honest and treat
a girl with respect,

01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:06.559
then whatever happens is meant to happen,
because it's all perfectly natural.

01:10:11.652 --> 01:10:14.734
Boys, I've prepared you for this quest.

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.608
And before you lies
the biggest test of your lives.

01:10:27.364 --> 01:10:29.651
This book is a powerful weapon,

01:10:32.032 --> 01:10:33.822
so use it for good,

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:36.736
not evil.

01:11:26.297 --> 01:11:27.376
Yes.

01:11:34.174 --> 01:11:35.798
You still looking for the vacuum?

01:11:35.883 --> 01:11:38.965
No. I found it in Cody's room. So strange.

01:11:39.051 --> 01:11:42.085
I mean, I just don't remember
leaving it there.

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:44.002
Losing my mind, clearly.

01:11:44.094 --> 01:11:46.630
Hey, Mom, can I go on the ski trip?

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:49.590
Yes.

01:11:50.179 --> 01:11:54.423
But no drinking,
and if you do drink, no driving.

01:11:54.513 --> 01:11:58.046
Don't worry. If I do anything wrong,
I'm sure it'll end up on YouTube, so...

01:11:58.139 --> 01:12:00.131
Call you when I get there.

01:12:19.812 --> 01:12:21.186
Drinking round!

01:12:29.815 --> 01:12:32.269
- Deal me in.
- What are you doing here?

01:12:32.357 --> 01:12:33.388
Katie.

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.806
I know. But what are you doing here?

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.389
- I wanna play.
- Right.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:40.724
Just deal her in, Stifler.
What's the big deal?

01:12:40.818 --> 01:12:42.477
Yeah, deal her in.

01:12:48.862 --> 01:12:50.236
Hi, Nathan.

01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:54.730
Thanks for the flowers.

01:12:54.822 --> 01:12:58.271
I'm sorry about being a jerk. And, for
the record, I've learned my lesson.

01:12:58.364 --> 01:13:01.316
I'm ready to respect you
and support you on your pledge.

01:13:01.407 --> 01:13:04.856
Really? But why?

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.531
I'm in this for you.
I'm not in it just to have sex.

01:13:10.034 --> 01:13:12.903
Well, I realised that I'm in this for you,

01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:16.823
and if the pledge gets in the way of that,
then how good can it really be?

01:13:16.911 --> 01:13:21.617
Sounds like a good basis for the two of us
to just relax and see what happens.

01:13:21.996 --> 01:13:24.568
Look. I bought a book.

01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:27.405
I was thinking that we could

01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:30.911
start on page one
and then see how far we get this weekend.

01:13:31.749 --> 01:13:33.906
The first three chapters are foreplay.

01:13:33.999 --> 01:13:35.078
Wow.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:39.039
You know, I've actually been
reading a book, as well.

01:13:39.126 --> 01:13:42.160
Have you ever heard of the tongue tornado?

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.293
Okay, let's go.

01:13:48.753 --> 01:13:50.910
This is supposed to be fun.

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.837
This isn't fun.

01:13:53.005 --> 01:13:56.169
Just you wait. You possess wisdom now.

01:13:56.922 --> 01:13:58.581
Trust in the book.

01:14:03.174 --> 01:14:07.216
I mean, what does that mean, anyway?
Do you think I'm too clingy?

01:14:07.425 --> 01:14:09.665
No. No, of course not.

01:14:10.009 --> 01:14:11.633
Do you even know how to play poker?

01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:12.749
I know the game.

01:14:12.843 --> 01:14:16.589
And I tell you what,
if I lose, I'll take off all my clothes.

01:14:19.179 --> 01:14:20.672
Snap.
Nice.

01:14:20.762 --> 01:14:22.255
And if I lose?

01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:24.428
You apologise to me.

01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:27.713
- For what? Blowing you off?
- Yes.

01:14:27.806 --> 01:14:30.591
If it's not enough, it was my first time.

01:14:30.807 --> 01:14:31.837
I deserve better.

01:14:34.183 --> 01:14:37.715
But if I win,
not only do you apologise to me,

01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:40.013
you gotta run through the snow naked.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.245
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.

01:14:53.246 --> 01:14:55.400
Start stripping, sweetheart.

01:14:55.702 --> 01:14:57.360
It's not over yet.

01:15:00.031 --> 01:15:01.523
Feeling lucky?

01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:06.560
You better hope for a
five on the river, baby.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.882
She got the five! Unbelievable.

01:15:18.392 --> 01:15:19.717
Oh, my God.

01:15:21.389 --> 01:15:23.046
- Strip.
- Hold on a second.

01:15:23.137 --> 01:15:24.628
- Strip.
- Strip.

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:27.668
Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip!

01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:32.826
Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip!

01:15:32.921 --> 01:15:36.000
You want me to strip?
You want some of this?

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.658
It's time to get it going, baby!

01:15:41.455 --> 01:15:44.451
All right, let's go! Here we go, baby.

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:48.268
Wait, let's talk this over.

01:15:50.559 --> 01:15:53.506
Shit. It's freezing out here.

01:15:53.679 --> 01:15:55.218
Now apologise.

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.297
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:15:57.673 --> 01:16:00.157
I'm sorry for not calling you afterwards.

01:16:00.252 --> 01:16:01.494
And what else?

01:16:01.583 --> 01:16:03.985
I'm sorry for being a dick, okay?

01:16:04.371 --> 01:16:06.487
Now, open the stinking door.

01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:08.019
Oh!

01:16:17.557 --> 01:16:19.095
Open the door!

01:16:19.179 --> 01:16:23.664
Now, tell everyone how you cry
like a little girl after you come.

01:16:23.755 --> 01:16:26.322
I cry like a girl after I come, okay?

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:29.491
It's a very intense experience for me.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.397
Call 911.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.743
Hey, I'll meet you at the lodge later.

01:17:49.835 --> 01:17:51.115
Yeah, yeah, sure. Go.

01:17:52.754 --> 01:17:54.664
Heidi. Wait up.

01:18:02.889 --> 01:18:05.344
Do you mind if I ride up with you?

01:18:05.767 --> 01:18:06.846
Okay.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.167
Hey. What's up?

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:42.173
We... We're in the same gondola.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.510
Yeah, look at that.

01:18:56.105 --> 01:18:57.386
Oh, God.

01:19:14.372 --> 01:19:15.747
I didn't sleep with Stifler.

01:19:15.832 --> 01:19:17.540
Yeah. I heard.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:20.832
- But you still hate me?
- No.

01:19:22.421 --> 01:19:24.414
No. Why would you say that?

01:19:24.507 --> 01:19:27.591
You haven't said a word to me
since that night.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.253
I know. I'm sorry.

01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:34.922
I guess I just...
I needed time to work through my feelings.

01:19:40.105 --> 01:19:43.141
And? What did you decide?

01:19:46.444 --> 01:19:50.144
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit on
a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.

01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:54.023
And he says they're talking about
amputating his feet from frostbite.

01:19:54.118 --> 01:19:57.284
Gibbs is a liar.
Stifler doesn't need amputation.

01:19:57.371 --> 01:19:59.944
That's too bad. I got an A in Shop.

01:20:05.753 --> 01:20:07.627
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

01:20:22.644 --> 01:20:23.889
Come to gloat?

01:20:23.979 --> 01:20:26.102
No. Just looking for a fag.

01:20:26.273 --> 01:20:29.973
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass
doesn't mean I'm gay.

01:20:30.068 --> 01:20:32.903
Very funny. How's your bum?

01:20:32.987 --> 01:20:37.115
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonaise jar,
but thanks for asking.

01:20:37.867 --> 01:20:40.986
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend.
That really sucks.

01:20:41.078 --> 01:20:44.281
Yeah. I thought only high school boys
were jerks.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.081
It turns out they never outgrow it.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:49.866
Lmogen, no offence,
and you're the most mature girl I know,

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:54.459
but a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take
a high-school girl seriously.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.960
I suppose not.

01:20:57.051 --> 01:20:58.795
You wanna sit down?

01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:00.715
What for?

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:03.842
I just thought we could both use
a friend right now.

01:21:16.528 --> 01:21:17.559
Stifler.

01:21:17.654 --> 01:21:19.196
My bad. Reflex.

01:21:22.325 --> 01:21:23.700
I'm sorry.

01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:25.399
You have to make your own decisions.

01:21:25.494 --> 01:21:29.444
You know, I just...
I thought we had something.

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.785
We did.

01:21:32.459 --> 01:21:33.657
We do.

01:21:35.045 --> 01:21:36.504
I was scared.

01:21:37.214 --> 01:21:38.459
Of what?

01:21:42.385 --> 01:21:44.010
I really like you.

01:21:45.513 --> 01:21:47.838
And I want it to be special.

01:21:49.267 --> 01:21:52.433
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

01:21:54.438 --> 01:21:58.851
So you almost had sex with Stifler
so you'd be ready for me.

01:22:00.277 --> 01:22:01.356
Yeah.

01:22:02.279 --> 01:22:05.114
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:22:06.199 --> 01:22:08.772
Well, I heard you got some practise.

01:22:09.452 --> 01:22:12.369
You know, the truth is,
is nothing happened.

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:17.119
I didn't want it to be random like that.

01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:18.532
And...

01:22:21.296 --> 01:22:25.341
I couldn't picture my first time
being with anybody else but you.

01:22:45.819 --> 01:22:47.313
What was that?

01:22:48.071 --> 01:22:49.696
I don't know.

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.991
- Looks like we're stuck.
- Yeah.

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:04.250
You know, we could be up here for a while.

01:23:04.337 --> 01:23:05.416
Yeah.

01:23:31.529 --> 01:23:33.320
Hey, can I ask you a question?

01:23:33.405 --> 01:23:35.113
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

01:23:35.199 --> 01:23:37.736
Why do you hook up with assholes
like Scott Stifler anyway?

01:23:37.826 --> 01:23:40.115
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:43.370
You know,
you're just the same as all the rest.

01:23:43.456 --> 01:23:44.619
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:47.163
You don't care about me.
You just wanna sleep with me,

01:23:47.252 --> 01:23:50.087
because you think
it's some sort of status symbol.

01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:51.334
Sorry.

01:23:53.758 --> 01:23:54.789
God.

01:23:56.385 --> 01:23:58.757
How long are we gonna be up here?

01:24:00.597 --> 01:24:02.091
I'll get help.

01:24:03.725 --> 01:24:05.136
What are you doing?

01:24:05.227 --> 01:24:07.978
It's not that far down,
and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

01:24:08.063 --> 01:24:10.055
What, is this supposed to impress me?

01:24:10.148 --> 01:24:12.187
The thought had crossed my mind.

01:24:12.275 --> 01:24:14.351
Absolutely not. First of
all, it's just wrong.

01:24:14.444 --> 01:24:16.732
Second of all,
you're not even supposed to touch the door.

01:24:16.821 --> 01:24:21.068
And third, it's just really dangerous,
okay? So just get away from there.

01:24:21.158 --> 01:24:23.614
Right. What was I thinking?

01:24:27.539 --> 01:24:28.618
Whoa!

01:24:32.127 --> 01:24:33.502
Are you okay?

01:24:33.586 --> 01:24:35.081
I think I hurt my leg.

01:24:36.631 --> 01:24:37.746
Idiot.

01:24:53.105 --> 01:24:54.599
Are you okay?

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:57.066
Are you crazy?

01:24:58.234 --> 01:24:59.693
Are you okay?

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.523
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:07.149
About what you said
about how I don't care about you

01:25:07.243 --> 01:25:09.994
and you're just a trophy,
that's actually not true.

01:25:10.079 --> 01:25:14.622
I really like you.
We went to elementary school together.

01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:18.083
<i>I remember when you sang Hey Ya!
In the sixth-grade talent show.</i>

01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:22.298
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
at the homecoming game, freshman year.

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:25.252
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

01:25:25.426 --> 01:25:29.127
I just liked how you played it off
like it was all part of the routine.

01:25:29.222 --> 01:25:35.805
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot
babe, but I actually like you for you.

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.684
Look, this may be a shock to you,

01:25:40.774 --> 01:25:45.021
but I have no idea what
I'm doing with girls.

01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:49.904
But I really wanna learn.
You just give me a chance.

01:25:50.825 --> 01:25:52.699
That's all I'm asking.

01:25:53.411 --> 01:25:57.408
And I guarantee that
I will make it my life's mission

01:25:57.498 --> 01:26:00.831
to satisfy you in every way possible.

01:26:37.452 --> 01:26:40.073
- Let's go back to the...
- To the cabin.

01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:40.129
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

01:27:47.684 --> 01:27:50.257
You sure we can't just keep it
for one more year?

01:27:50.353 --> 01:27:52.346
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:38.351
<i>This is my little brother, Cody,</i>

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:42.474
<i>and this is what he does
with the vacuum every day.</i>

01:28:43.444 --> 01:28:45.401
No! Hey! No!

01:28:45.905 --> 01:28:48.989
<i>Help! It's stuck! I can't get it off!</i>

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:53.109
<i>Help! Help! It's stuck.</i>

01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:54.908
<i>Gotcha.</i>

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:57.321
<i>Help!</i>

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:01.658
No!

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:09.876
She was using me. I... That was really bad.

01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:12.669
Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?

01:29:13.556 --> 01:29:16.225
Wanna suck me off in the Sharper lmage?

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.186
Rob, are you some kind of jive turkey?

01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:24.266
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

01:29:24.941 --> 01:29:26.815
Did you bring condoms?

01:29:26.985 --> 01:29:28.064
What?

01:29:28.153 --> 01:29:31.272
I wet the bed until I
was 13 years old, okay?

01:29:31.406 --> 01:29:33.944
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky
at a Jonas Brothers concert

01:29:34.033 --> 01:29:36.156
with a fistful of backstage passes.

01:29:36.536 --> 01:29:40.284
<i>Faith in God and His
promise of eternal life.</i>

01:29:41.874 --> 01:29:44.828
Now, put the condom on the banana.

01:29:45.878 --> 01:29:49.543
Who didn't see that coming?
Look at the time. Gotta go.

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:53.342
I think that is quite enough pictures
of the cheerleaders.

01:29:53.426 --> 01:29:54.885
How about we get some of the game?

01:29:56.387 --> 01:29:57.467
We're eating.

01:29:59.599 --> 01:30:02.006
You've been fucking Americans or...

01:30:02.643 --> 01:30:04.351
Watching, loving...

01:30:08.023 --> 01:30:09.054
Bear with me.

01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:12.020
If she's down, bring her flowers.

01:30:12.319 --> 01:30:14.810
If she's thirsty, serve her fine champagne.

01:30:14.905 --> 01:30:17.277
Yeah, 'cause, I'm telling you,
my wife is pretty effing hot.

01:30:17.365 --> 01:30:20.816
I'm talking a tight, tight ass
and squeaky clean.

01:30:21.661 --> 01:30:24.366
Is that cream-filled? You rock.

01:30:24.956 --> 01:30:27.114
Oh. Don't mention that, okay?

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:32.162
<i>And whenever it comes to making out,
put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.</i>
