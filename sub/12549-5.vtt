WEBVTT

00:07.778 --> 00:09.280
- PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...
- WHAT'S IT LIKE?

00:09.280 --> 00:10.711
BEING AROUND DANNY
ALL THE TIME AGAIN?

00:10.711 --> 00:13.444
- IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFERENT.
- ( both chuckle )

00:13.444 --> 00:14.785
SHE GOT IT SOMETIME
LAST SPRING.

00:14.785 --> 00:17.017
KNOW WHERE?
WHO GAVE IT TO HER?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.789
DOES IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

00:18.789 --> 00:20.091
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, DANNY?

00:20.091 --> 00:22.293
I JUST WANT...

00:24.255 --> 00:25.326
I CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:25.326 --> 00:26.657
THAT REMINDS ME
OF WHAT I DID.

00:26.657 --> 00:29.160
- INCLUDING TARA'S NECKLACE?
- WHAT NECKLACE?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.202
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:31.202 --> 00:33.033
ANYTHING IN THE BEDROOM?
OKAY, LET'S GO.

00:34.065 --> 00:35.106
I KNOW WHAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

00:35.106 --> 00:36.036
WHEN REGINA DIED,
SHE WAS WEARING

00:36.036 --> 00:37.438
MY AUNT TARA'S NECKLACE.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.739
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US THAT?!

00:38.739 --> 00:39.740
I GUESS WE HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT

00:39.740 --> 00:41.542
HOW REGINA GOT
THAT NECKLACE.

00:56.787 --> 00:58.729
( gasps )

01:01.132 --> 01:03.634
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
PEANUT BUTTER.

01:03.634 --> 01:05.065
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT MAKES YOU PUDGY.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.169
NOT MY PROBLEM ANYMORE.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.471
WOW, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
JUDGING A DEAD PERSON
RIGHT NOW?

01:10.471 --> 01:11.742
( chuckles softly )

01:11.742 --> 01:13.204
NO, YOU'RE JUST EATING IT
SO QUICKLY.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.446
- TAKE A BREATH.
- CAN'T.

01:15.446 --> 01:18.149
GOD'S A VEGAN.
HE'S WEIRD ABOUT PROCESSED FOOD.

01:18.149 --> 01:19.780
IF HE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS,
HE'D KILL ME.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.813
A LINE LIKE THAT
WOULD KILL IN HEAVEN.

01:22.813 --> 01:24.485
HA! I JUST SAID
"KILL" AGAIN.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.188
HEAVEN, HUH?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.189
WELL-PLAYED.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.860
WELL...

01:29.860 --> 01:31.362
I HAD TO LIE ABOUT
HOW MANY PEOPLE
I'VE SLEPT WITH.

01:31.362 --> 01:32.493
THEY ONLY ALLOW TWO.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.195
SO,

01:34.195 --> 01:35.626
TELL ME ABOUT STUFF.
CATCH ME UP.

01:35.626 --> 01:36.627
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

01:36.627 --> 01:38.629
NOTHING.

01:38.629 --> 01:41.172
♪ SOMEONE'S GOT A SECRET ♪

01:41.172 --> 01:43.474
- ♪ AND HER NAME IS LACEY. ♪
- ( chuckles )

01:43.474 --> 01:44.805
SPILL IT, BITCH.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.637
IS IT ABOUT DANNY?

01:46.637 --> 01:47.838
YOU WANNA HIT THAT,
DON'T YOU?

01:47.838 --> 01:50.511
WHAT? NO, I DON'T.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.582
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

01:51.582 --> 01:54.215
THAT LONG HAIR...

01:54.215 --> 01:55.846
THE MENACING EYES,

01:55.846 --> 01:57.788
THE STRONG,
MURDEROUS HANDS.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.794
WHEN DANNY KILLED ME,
HE WAS SMILING.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.456
IT WAS CREEPY AT THE TIME.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.528
BUT NOW... HOT.

02:08.799 --> 02:09.800
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.802
THIS THING?

02:11.802 --> 02:14.635
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.167
YOU THINK IT'S A CLUE?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.310
NO, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

02:19.310 --> 02:23.214
YOU THINK DANNY TOOK THIS
FROM ME, DON'T YOU?

02:24.515 --> 02:26.517
REGINA, PLEASE JUST STOP IT.

02:26.517 --> 02:28.849
YOU THINK HE TOOK IT
FROM ME WHEN HE KILLED ME.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.422
YOU THINK HE YANKED IT
FROM MY COLD, DEAD...

02:31.422 --> 02:33.424
- NECK.
- ( gasps, pants )

02:39.690 --> 02:42.833
Sources have confirmed that
a search warrant served at
the Desai residence...

02:42.833 --> 02:45.536
HOLD ON, MOM.
I THINK DAD'S ABOUT
TO GET A SHOUT-OUT.

02:45.536 --> 02:48.539
The Regina Crane murder
remains unsolved,

02:48.539 --> 02:51.542
putting the town of Green Grove
increasingly on edge

02:51.542 --> 02:53.844
heading into its famous
annual Fall Festival--

02:53.844 --> 02:55.546
( TV turns off )

02:55.546 --> 02:57.908
HEY, UNSOLVED.
THAT'S ME.

02:57.908 --> 03:00.881
WELL, FESTIVAL'S CERTAINLY
GETTING A PUBLICITY BUMP.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.884
MAYBE I'LL EVEN GET A FEW
OUT-OF-TOWNERS SIGNING UP
FOR MY POTTERY CLASS.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.456
YOU DON'T NEED
ANY EXTRA PUBLICITY.

03:05.456 --> 03:07.218
YOUR BOOTH'S
GONNA BE AWESOME.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.490
AWESOME ENOUGH TO GET YOU
TO CHECK OUT THE FESTIVAL
THIS YEAR?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.191
IT'S NOT MY THING.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.493
USED TO BE.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.965
YOU AND I WOULD PUT TOGETHER
THE MOST ELABORATE OUTFITS

03:14.965 --> 03:16.367
FOR YOU TO WEAR
TO THE EVENING FORMAL.

03:16.367 --> 03:19.800
THOSE BIG DRESSES WITH
THOSE FANCY PINK BOWS.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.473
YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT 10 ANYMORE, MOM.

03:22.473 --> 03:23.934
I'M AWARE OF THAT, SWEETIE.

03:23.934 --> 03:26.637
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...

03:26.637 --> 03:28.979
THAT TRADITION IS
KIND OF DATED, YOU KNOW?

03:28.979 --> 03:30.481
FAIR ENOUGH.

03:30.481 --> 03:31.812
LET'S JUST HOPE
FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE

03:31.812 --> 03:33.644
THAT DANNY SHARES
YOUR ATTITUDE.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.317
WHY? YOUR RAID DIDN'T FIND
ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

03:37.988 --> 03:39.250
NOT EVEN THE NECKLACE.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.354
NECKLACE? WHAT NECKLACE?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.827
YOU WANNA TELL HER?

03:48.799 --> 03:52.463
REGINA CRANE WAS WEARING
TARA DESAI'S NECKLACE...

03:52.463 --> 03:54.635
WHEN SHE DIED.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.507
IS THAT ALL DANNY TOLD YOU?

03:57.608 --> 03:59.970
AND IT WAS MISSING...

03:59.970 --> 04:00.971
FROM REGINA.

04:02.673 --> 04:05.346
WHY WOULD DANNY KILL REGINA
AND THEN TAKE THE ONE THING

04:05.346 --> 04:07.848
- THAT WOULD MAKE
HIM LOOK GUILTY?
- GOOD QUESTION.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.851
DID DANNY EXPLAIN
TO YOU WHAT THE DEAL
IS WITH THIS NECKLACE?

04:12.623 --> 04:14.355
IT WAS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

04:18.829 --> 04:22.032
ANYWAY, AREN'T YOU MORE
INTERESTED IN WHO GAVE
REGINA THE NECKLACE?

04:22.032 --> 04:23.434
- WHY SHE HAD IT.
- BELIEVE ME,

04:23.434 --> 04:25.436
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS
FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE.

04:27.998 --> 04:30.441
I HAVE TO GET TO SCHOOL, SO--

04:30.441 --> 04:32.973
OKAY, HAVE A NICE WALK.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.675
( door closes )

04:34.675 --> 04:36.307
REGINA HAD
TARA'S NECKLACE?

04:36.307 --> 04:37.808
WHO DO YOU THINK
GAVE IT TO HER?

04:37.808 --> 04:39.810
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
DANNY'S INNOCENT TOO?

04:39.810 --> 04:42.783
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.
- WELL, THAT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.284
JO'S GETTING
OUT OF CONTROL.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.617
MAYBE WE SHOULD
START PRESENTING
A MORE UNITED FRONT.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.829
( door opens )

04:58.829 --> 05:00.871
( door closes )

05:10.811 --> 05:12.883
Man on TV:
I think the town
should ban him.

05:12.883 --> 05:14.945
Fall Fest is a
cherished tradition.
It's a family event.

05:14.945 --> 05:17.788
And the last thing we need
is a killer coming and
freaking everyone out.

05:17.788 --> 05:19.920
WOW, TELL US HOW
YOU REALLY FEEL, TIM CALVERT,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.452
LOCAL RESIDENT.

05:21.452 --> 05:22.453
- ( sighs )
- ( remote clicks )

05:22.453 --> 05:23.594
YOU WANT SOME CEREAL?

05:23.594 --> 05:25.596
UH, YEAH YEAH.

05:25.596 --> 05:26.757
I'LL MA-- I'LL MAKE IT.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.862
YOU, UH, THINKING OF GOING?

05:31.862 --> 05:34.705
( chuckles )
TO THE, UH...

05:34.705 --> 05:36.367
FALL FEST?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:36.367 --> 05:37.668
YOU?

05:37.668 --> 05:39.339
OOH, AFTER THAT
CHARITY BRUNCH?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.442
I THINK I NEED A LITTLE
BREAK FROM THE TOWN.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.113
( exhales )

05:43.113 --> 05:44.845
MAYBE YOU NEED A BREAK TOO.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.018
WELL, NOT ACCORDING
TO DR. REIDY.

05:48.018 --> 05:51.021
SHE WANTS ME TO CONNECT
WITH MEANINGFUL EVENTS
FROM MY PAST.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.983
IT MIGHT HELP
WITH MY "TRANSITION."

06:05.866 --> 06:09.139
SO I DECIDED TO DONATE
SOME OF YOUR DAD'S
THINGS TO GOODWILL.

06:09.139 --> 06:11.972
SOMEONE'S COMING THIS MORNING
TO PICK THEM UP.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.004
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

06:14.004 --> 06:15.075
WHAT THINGS?

06:15.075 --> 06:18.609
SOME OF HIS OLD CLOTHES,
SUITS AND TIES,

06:18.609 --> 06:19.880
THE BIG CHAIR IN THE DEN.

06:21.712 --> 06:23.053
THE CHAIR?

06:24.715 --> 06:25.916
THAT A PROBLEM?

06:26.857 --> 06:29.420
KINDA. YEAH, ACTUALLY.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.793
MAYBE IT'S TOO SOON...

06:32.793 --> 06:34.465
GET RID OF DAD'S STUFF--
I LIKE HAVING IT AROUND.

06:34.465 --> 06:37.097
IT MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE, UH,

06:37.097 --> 06:38.699
HE'S STILL HERE.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.703
OKAY.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.875
WE CAN WAIT.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.006
THANKS.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.845
( theme music playing )

07:00.791 --> 07:03.093
COME ON, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TALKED ME INTO JOINING
THE STUPID MATHLETES.

07:03.093 --> 07:06.857
WHAT? SO NOW I'M REQUIRED
TO HELP YOU SELL PIES
AT FALL FEST?

07:06.857 --> 07:08.058
NO, THEY'RE PI PIES.

07:08.058 --> 07:11.161
YOU-- YOU GET IT, RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE THE SYMBOL PI.

07:11.161 --> 07:12.963
YOU MATHLETES SURE
KNOW HOW TO PUN.

07:12.963 --> 07:16.707
OKAY, WELL, ONE OF
THESE YEARS, I'M GONNA
DRAG YOU TO THIS FESTIVAL.

07:16.707 --> 07:18.038
YEAH, WELL,
NOT THIS YEAR.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.011
MY TOWN SPIRIT
ISN'T EXACTLY AT
AN ALL-TIME HIGH.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.143
IS IT BECAUSE OF
THE DANNY STUFF?

07:23.143 --> 07:26.016
I GUESS I JUST WISH
MORE PEOPLE WOULD

07:26.016 --> 07:27.948
GIVE HIM A CHANCE,
YOU KNOW?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.481
YEAH, BUT YOU GET WHY PEOPLE
ARE STILL FREAKED, RIGHT?

07:30.481 --> 07:32.653
( stammering )
I'M NOT SAYING
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.684
NO, I KNOW.

07:33.684 --> 07:36.557
PEOPLE CAN THINK
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.560
FALL FEST USED
TO BE FUN,

07:39.560 --> 07:41.191
BUT I DON'T KNOW...

07:41.191 --> 07:42.563
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT

07:42.563 --> 07:44.194
A TOWN COMMUNITY
KINDA GIRL ANYMORE.

07:44.194 --> 07:46.737
MY SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER
MR. JASPER SAYS THAT

07:46.737 --> 07:48.899
ALL HUMAN BEINGS HAVE
THE SAME BASIC NEEDS

07:48.899 --> 07:51.572
FOR COMMUNITY
AND TRADITION.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.674
YOU CAN TRACE IT
BACK TO MAYAN TIMES.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.746
RIGHT. BECAUSE
THE MAYANS ARE
NEVER WRONG.

07:59.149 --> 08:00.781
( school bell rings )

08:00.781 --> 08:01.982
Lacey: GOD, I'M DREADING
THIS WEEKEND.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.514
FALL FEST IS
SUCH A PRODUCTION.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.016
I KNOW. I KINDA
WISH I WAS GOING.

08:06.016 --> 08:08.058
COME ON! YOU'RE GETTING
A NIGHT OUT IN MANHATTAN.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.190
YEAH, WITH MY PARENTS
AND MY BROTHER.

08:10.190 --> 08:14.024
I HAD THE MOST PERFECT DRESS
PICKED OUT FOR EVENING FORMAL.

08:14.024 --> 08:18.669
YELLOW WITH THIS BRIGHT RED
FRILL SHOOTING OFF IN EVERY
DIRECTION.

08:18.669 --> 08:21.201
ARCHIE, SARITA AND SCOTT
ARE ALL DITCHING TOO.

08:23.574 --> 08:25.876
IT IS A WEIRD YEAR.
A.R.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.508
"AFTER REGINA."

08:28.508 --> 08:30.681
RIGHT.
( chuckles softly )

08:30.681 --> 08:33.143
- GOSH, SHE WAS SO INTO IT.
- ( mumbles )

08:35.746 --> 08:37.548
DO YOU EVER DREAM ABOUT HER?

08:37.548 --> 08:39.019
ALL THE TIME.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.292
IT'S LIKE SHE HAS
HER OWN ROOM IN
MY SUBCONSCIOUS.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.296
I DREAMT ABOUT HER
LAST NIGHT.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.829
I ASKED HER ABOUT
THAT NECKLACE.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.931
YOU KNOW, THAT RED AND GOLD
ONE SHE WAS ALWAYS WEARING.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.763
OH, THE ONE THAT THE POLICE
WERE ASKING ABOUT?

08:52.763 --> 08:53.734
YEAH.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.906
I WONDER WHERE SHE GOT IT.

08:55.906 --> 08:57.568
YOU SHOULD ASK
REGINA'S MOM ABOUT IT.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.871
NO, I DON'T WANNA BOTHER HER.

09:03.874 --> 09:05.646
( indistinct chatter )

09:05.646 --> 09:08.048
DANNY DESAI SHOULD NOT
BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND
THE FESTIVAL.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.880
THIS IS ABOUT
MORE THAN SAFETY, ALL RIGHT?

09:09.880 --> 09:12.923
THIS IS A FAMILY EVENT.
SOMETHING I DID AS A KID,

09:12.923 --> 09:13.954
AND NOW DO WITH MY KIDS.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.986
OKAY, LET'S SETTLE DOWN.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.958
I KNOW THE MEDIA ATTENTION
HAS US ALL A BIT ON EDGE,

09:17.958 --> 09:19.990
BUT I CAN'T BAR ANY RESIDENT
FROM ATTENDING.

09:19.990 --> 09:23.133
EXACTLY. WHO ARE WE
TO JUDGE DANNY DESAI?

09:23.133 --> 09:25.666
THE POLICE HAVE HAD
WEEKS TO ARREST HIM
AND THEY HAVEN'T.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.237
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM INNOCENT.

09:27.237 --> 09:29.069
WE'RE NOT HERE TO
TALK ABOUT THE CASE,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.772
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT
SAFETY AT FALL FEST.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.243
AND I WANT TO ASSURE
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

09:33.243 --> 09:36.046
THAT I TAKE THAT
RESPONSIBILITY
VERY SERIOUSLY.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.048
WELL, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT,
CHIEF MASTERSON,

09:38.048 --> 09:41.581
WHEN YOU ALLOW YOUR DAUGHTER
TO CAVORT AROUND TOWN WITH
THE KILLER?

09:42.713 --> 09:43.884
LEAVE MY DAUGHTER
OUT OF THIS, TIM.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.256
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE.

09:46.256 --> 09:48.619
LET'S JUST TAKE IT EASY.

09:48.619 --> 09:51.091
LET'S JUST LAY OFF
CHIEF MASTERSON, HUH?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.694
MAYOR ROLLINS, I HAVE BEEN
ATTENDING THIS FESTIVAL
SINCE I WAS FIVE--

09:53.694 --> 09:55.325
AND I'VE BEEN GOING
SINCE I WAS THREE.

09:55.325 --> 09:57.998
SO I GUESS I GOT YOU
BEAT THERE, TIM.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.900
- ( scattered chuckles )
- NOW LOOK, DANNY DESAI

09:59.900 --> 10:02.072
OR NO DANNY DESAI,
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE

10:02.072 --> 10:05.976
A FANTASTIC, SAFE,
FUN FALL FESTIVAL.

10:05.976 --> 10:08.679
AND CHIEF MASTERSON IS
GONNA MAKE SURE OF IT!

10:08.679 --> 10:10.010
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
CHIEF MASTERSON?

10:12.943 --> 10:15.015
ALL RIGHT.
( exhales )

10:15.015 --> 10:17.087
( slurps )

10:20.350 --> 10:23.193
SO, DO YOU THINK THERE'S
SOME SORT OF MASSIVE

10:23.193 --> 10:24.895
TOWN EVENT THIS WEEKEND?

10:24.895 --> 10:27.027
POSSIBLY. MAYBE ONE
INVOLVING...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.899
FALL.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.931
GOOD CALL.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.633
GOD, DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT CRAZY DANCE

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
YOU, ME AND LACEY
USED TO DO AT THE
EVENING FORMAL?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.637
YEAH. YEAH.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.810
WE USED TO KINDA
HAVE FUN AT THIS
THING, HUH?

10:39.810 --> 10:42.272
YEAH, WE DID.

10:42.272 --> 10:43.774
YOU SHOULD GO.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.076
ME? TO THE FESTIVAL

10:46.076 --> 10:48.248
WHEN ACTUAL PEOPLE
ARE ATTENDING IT?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.820
YEAH. WHY NOT?

10:51.421 --> 10:53.884
WHAT IF I WENT WITH YOU?

10:53.884 --> 10:55.155
DIDN'T YOU CALL FALL FEST

10:55.155 --> 10:57.988
"A LAME, CHEESY, OUTDATED
TRADITION PACKED WITH...

10:57.988 --> 11:00.230
FANATICAL TOWN SPIRIT
ZEALOTS"?

11:00.230 --> 11:01.892
I NEVER SAID
IT WAS CHEESY.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.994
LET'S JUST GO FOR
A LITTLE BIT TOMORROW.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.437
YEAH. OKAY. SURE.

11:08.969 --> 11:09.970
( sighs )

11:12.142 --> 11:14.004
HEY, LACE.
WHAT'S, UH--

11:14.004 --> 11:16.006
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- I'M JUST WAITING
FOR MY FOOD.

11:18.048 --> 11:19.049
HI, JO.

11:19.049 --> 11:21.882
LACEY.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.884
SO, JO AND I

11:23.884 --> 11:25.956
WERE TALKING ABOUT
FALL FEST. YOU GOING?

11:25.956 --> 11:29.419
- I HAVE TO, MY MOM'S
AN ORGANIZER.
- Danny: AH.

11:29.419 --> 11:32.062
YOU'RE NOT GOING, ARE YOU?

11:32.062 --> 11:34.364
- WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT IT, YEAH.
- REALLY?

11:34.364 --> 11:37.027
EVERYONE'S PRETTY TENSE
AFTER THAT RAID.

11:37.027 --> 11:40.100
OH, THE RAID THAT DIDN'T
TURN UP ANY EVIDENCE?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.031
THAT WE KNOW OF.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.002
MM.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.874
YOU WERE REGINA'S B.F.F.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.375
YOU'D THINK YOU'D KNOW
ALL SORTS OF STUFF.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.907
OKAY, LADIES.
THAT'S ENOUGH

11:46.907 --> 11:48.238
BANTER FOR ONE EVENING,
I THINK.

11:48.238 --> 11:50.040
REALLY, JO? LIKE WHAT?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.711
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
HOW ABOUT

11:51.711 --> 11:53.443
WHERE REGINA
GOT THAT NECKLACE.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.987
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE NECKLACE?

12:00.090 --> 12:01.952
OKAY, LACEY, LOOK.

12:01.952 --> 12:04.925
THAT NECKLACE...

12:04.925 --> 12:07.127
THAT NECKLACE BELONGED
TO MY AUNT TARA.

12:07.127 --> 12:11.001
THAT'S WHY THE POLICE
ARE SO INTENT ON MY GUILT.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.863
YEAH. CAN YOU BLAME THEM?

12:12.863 --> 12:15.035
DANNY WAS LOCKED UP
FOR FIVE YEARS, LACEY.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.337
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
THE PERSON WHO GAVE
REGINA THE NECKLACE

12:17.337 --> 12:18.468
MIGHT BE CONNECTED TO--

12:18.468 --> 12:20.140
JUST STOP IT, JO.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.973
THIS ISN'T A GAME.
REGINA WAS A REAL PERSON.

12:22.973 --> 12:24.444
I NEVER SAID SHE WASN'T.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.976
AND HOW CAN YOU GO
TO THE FESTIVAL

12:25.976 --> 12:26.977
WITH ALL THIS CRAZINESS
GOING ON?

12:26.977 --> 12:28.779
IT'S SELFISH!

12:28.779 --> 12:30.781
YOU'RE MAKING IT
ALL ABOUT YOU!

12:33.924 --> 12:35.055
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, OKAY?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.087
SHE'S WRONG.

12:47.097 --> 12:49.099
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
- ( indistinct whispers )

12:59.950 --> 13:00.951
Man:
THAT'S DANNY DESAI.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.254
HEY, MRS. MASTERSON.

13:04.254 --> 13:05.916
UH, JO AROUND?

13:05.916 --> 13:08.959
SHE JUST RAN TO
SAY HI TO RICO.

13:12.062 --> 13:14.224
SO...
( chuckles nervously )

13:14.224 --> 13:16.396
HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.228
LOTS OF GLARES
AND TENSE LOOKS,

13:18.228 --> 13:19.930
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH
PAR FOR THE COURSE--

13:19.930 --> 13:21.801
SO GOOD, I GUESS.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.304
YOU TEACHING
A POTTERY CLASS?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.837
- YEAH.
- THAT'S COOL.

13:26.837 --> 13:28.178
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN
HOW TO MAKE ONE OF THESE.

13:28.178 --> 13:29.880
OH, YOU SHOULD SIGN UP.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.944
REALLY?
YOU SURE THAT'S OKAY?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.187
YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.823
YOU'RE SIGNING UP?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.995
THAT'S AWESOME.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.230
WELL, I CAME, I SAW,
I DIDN'T EXACTLY CONQUER.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.933
BUT NO ONE SPAT ON ME.
RIGHT? BONUS.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.404
DO YOU WANNA LEAVE?
LET'S GO GET SOME FOOD.

13:54.404 --> 13:57.908
ACTUALLY, I SIGNED US UP TO
WORK AT RICO'S MATHLETE BOOTH.

13:57.908 --> 13:58.939
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE

13:58.939 --> 14:01.541
WE COULD GO TO
THE FORMAL TONIGHT.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.543
JO.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.075
YOU WANNA COME TONIGHT?

14:05.075 --> 14:08.148
DON'T SAY NO RIGHT AWAY,

14:08.148 --> 14:10.220
BUT I SAW A DRESS
A FEW BOOTHS DOWN

14:10.220 --> 14:11.851
AND I THINK IT WOULD
LOOK GREAT ON YOU.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.953
UH, UM--

14:12.953 --> 14:14.925
DON'T SPEAK. HERE.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.086
STAY.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.460
( sighing )
SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO PUT A DRESS ON ME

14:20.460 --> 14:22.632
FOR YEARS,
THAT POOR WOMAN.

14:22.632 --> 14:25.265
( laughing )

14:25.265 --> 14:27.267
SO, UM, WHAT HAPPENED TO

14:27.267 --> 14:29.439
"CHECK OUT A COUPLE
OF BOOTHS AND LEAVE"?

14:29.439 --> 14:31.942
I JUST DON'T WANNA
PUSH MY LUCK, OKAY?

14:31.942 --> 14:33.303
DON'T LET LACEY
GET IN YOUR HEAD.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.645
IF YOU WANNA DO FALL FEST,
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.110
WELL?

14:40.110 --> 14:41.581
IT'S, UM--

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
IT'S A DRESS.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.284
I THINK YOU'D LOOK
AMAZING IN IT.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.357
ACTUALLY, I--
( sighs )

14:47.357 --> 14:49.519
I THINK I MIGHT
JUST WEAR SOMETHING
OUT OF MY OWN CLOSET.

14:49.519 --> 14:52.092
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
NICE PANTS,

14:52.092 --> 14:55.095
MAYBE A FANCY SWEATER.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.097
PANTS... AND A SWEATER.

14:58.468 --> 14:59.970
HOW FESTIVE.

15:06.937 --> 15:08.608
( chuckling )

15:08.608 --> 15:12.142
YOU ARE SO THOUGHTFUL
TO BRING THESE BY.

15:12.142 --> 15:13.513
THIS IS FROM

15:13.513 --> 15:15.615
YOUR GIRLS' WEEKEND
IN CAPE COD LAST YEAR,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.517
- ISN'T IT?
- YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.520
OHH, LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

15:24.594 --> 15:28.128
MRS. CRANE, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE REGINA GOT THAT NECKLACE?

15:28.128 --> 15:32.302
NO, I HAVE NO IDEA.
CHIEF MASTERSON ASKED
ME THE SAME QUESTION.

15:32.302 --> 15:33.403
YEAH, ME TOO.

15:33.403 --> 15:35.935
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.409
WELL, JUST THAT
SHE STARTED WEARING IT
SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO.

15:39.409 --> 15:40.710
SHE TOLD ME IT WAS A GIFT.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.942
SHE NEVER SAID
WHO GAVE IT TO HER?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.146
LACEY, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

15:47.477 --> 15:49.149
NOTHING. I'M SORRY.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.221
JUST CURIOUS.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.654
WELL, LACEY,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.957
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
I'M FINALLY GETTING TO ALL
THESE CONDOLENCE LETTERS.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.589
DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?

15:59.589 --> 16:02.592
I COULD SORT IT ALL FOR YOU,
MAKE A LIST OF EVERYONE WHO
WROTE TO YOU,

16:02.592 --> 16:04.334
SO IT'S EASIER TO REPLY.

16:04.334 --> 16:07.167
OHH...

16:07.167 --> 16:09.399
LACEY, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

16:13.673 --> 16:18.708
- ( people chattering )
- ( police radio chatter )

16:22.482 --> 16:23.983
- JOHN.
- ( door closes )

16:23.983 --> 16:26.486
MY OFFICE HAS BEEN
GETTING CALLS ALL MORNING.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.159
GUESS WHO DECIDED TO SPEND
THE DAY AT THE FESTIVAL?

16:29.159 --> 16:31.621
AND GUESS WHO HE WAS SEEN
HANGING AROUND WITH?

16:31.621 --> 16:33.323
OH, WHAT A FUN GAME.
LET ME SEE.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.165
UM, WAVY HAIR, SURLY SMILE,

16:35.165 --> 16:36.666
ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF JO?

16:36.666 --> 16:38.328
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:38.328 --> 16:39.329
ALONG WITH YOUR WIFE.

16:42.472 --> 16:43.773
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

16:43.773 --> 16:46.576
YEAH, BUSY MAKING A MOCKERY
OF THIS TOWN.

16:46.576 --> 16:48.238
THAT RAID WAS A P.R. NIGHTMARE.

16:48.238 --> 16:50.580
AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THIS ENTIRE CRANE INVESTIGATION

16:50.580 --> 16:53.743
- IS A COMPLETE MESS!
- I'M WORKING ON IT.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.745
THAT NECKLACE IS STILL
THE BEST LEAD WE HAVE.

16:55.745 --> 16:58.248
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
AT THE DESAI HOUSE? A NECKLACE?

16:58.248 --> 17:01.091
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LINK
BETWEEN REGINA AND TARA--

17:01.091 --> 17:03.253
HOW THE GIRL GOT THAT THING.

17:03.253 --> 17:05.495
IT WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY
AFTER TARA'S DEATH,

17:05.495 --> 17:07.327
THEN THE ESTATE LAWYERS.
BUT NOBODY HAS A RECORD

17:07.327 --> 17:08.728
OF WHO IT WENT TO NEXT.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.560
WHAT ABOUT A FREAKING
MURDER WEAPON?!

17:10.560 --> 17:12.562
DANNY HAD TO HIT
THE GIRL WITH SOMETHING.

17:12.562 --> 17:14.404
WE HAVEN'T FOUND ONE YET.

17:14.404 --> 17:16.536
BUT THERE WERE TRACES
OF PAINT AT THE POINT
OF IMPACT.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.509
- PAINT FROM WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.341
THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.173
THAT CRIME SCENE WAS
A MESS BECAUSE OF THAT PARTY,

17:23.173 --> 17:25.815
THE ALIBIS ARE A BLUR,
'CAUSE EVERYONE WAS DRUNK.

17:25.815 --> 17:27.647
YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING
WITH THIS? THE NECKLACE--

17:27.647 --> 17:31.181
FALL FEST...

17:31.181 --> 17:34.524
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF THE YEAR FOR GREEN GROVE.

17:34.524 --> 17:37.157
YOU KNOW THAT.
ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

17:37.157 --> 17:41.291
I'M HOLDING YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.835
ARE WE CLEAR, KYLE?

17:45.835 --> 17:47.837
CRYSTAL CLEAR... JOHN.

17:54.344 --> 17:56.676
COME ON, BUY WARM PI PIES.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.348
THEY PUN AND THEY TASTE GREAT.

17:58.348 --> 18:02.612
BUY A FRESH PI PIE,
HELP THE MATHLETES
EARN MONEY FOR, UM--

18:02.612 --> 18:04.284
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.287
TRAVEL COSTS,
HOTEL ROOMS...

18:07.287 --> 18:09.359
( sighs )
NOTE CARDS...

18:09.359 --> 18:10.560
LIKE TO
MEMORIZE STUFF.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.765
- IT'S GOING WELL, HUH?
- I GUESS.

18:15.765 --> 18:17.727
COME ON, DANNY'S
A SELLING MACHINE.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.230
AND NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOUR MATHLETE BUDDIES

18:20.230 --> 18:23.733
AREN'T EXACTLY
BORN SALESMEN AND WOMEN.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.576
( shakily )
HEY, DO YOU WANNA BUY A PIE

18:26.576 --> 18:27.577
FROM ME?

18:29.279 --> 18:30.280
OKAY.

18:32.242 --> 18:33.583
CAN YOU CARRY THESE PIES
OVER TO THE TABLE?

18:33.583 --> 18:36.286
- YEAH.
- THANKS.

18:36.286 --> 18:37.787
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:37.787 --> 18:38.788
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED MY HELP.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.690
YEAH, YOUR HELP.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.423
OKAY.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.227
- MORE ENTHUSIASM.
- MORE ENTHUSIASM.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.399
- MORE ENTHUSIASM.
PI PIES FOR EVERYONE!
- PIES!

18:49.399 --> 18:51.431
SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY A PI PIE?

18:51.431 --> 18:52.432
NOT FROM YOU.

18:54.264 --> 18:55.465
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF

18:55.465 --> 18:58.638
BEING HERE, ACTING LIKE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.140
- LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- CAN YOU BACK THE HELL OFF?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.473
HE HAS AS MUCH OF A RIGHT
TO BE HERE AS YOU.

19:03.473 --> 19:05.475
OKAY, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST CALM DOWN, BECAUSE--

19:05.475 --> 19:07.317
IT'S COOL.
I CAN JUST LEAVE.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.219
HOW CAN YOU DEFEND HIM?
HE'S A FREAKING MURDERER!

19:09.219 --> 19:11.721
- YOU'RE A RIGHT WING NUT!
- ARE SERIOUSLY THAT STUPID?

19:11.721 --> 19:12.852
I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR OUR KIDS!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.684
- HE IS ONE OF OUR KIDS.
- OH!

19:14.684 --> 19:16.186
- SIR? SIR?
- HEY!

19:16.186 --> 19:17.427
( grunts )

19:19.929 --> 19:21.491
HEY HEY HEY HEY, TIM!

19:21.491 --> 19:25.335
TIM TIM! KEEP YOUR
HANDS OFF HIM, TIM.
OKAY?

19:25.335 --> 19:26.366
OKAY?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.697
YEAH.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.741
OKAY, PEOPLE.
LET'S SETTLE DOWN.

19:31.741 --> 19:33.703
NOTHING ELSE TO SEE HERE.
LET'S MOVE ON, OKAY?

19:33.703 --> 19:35.745
( claps hands )
COME ON, HAVE A GREAT DAY.

19:35.745 --> 19:36.806
ENJOY THE FESTIVAL.

19:36.806 --> 19:39.349
( crowd murmuring )

19:55.965 --> 19:57.327
WELL, SOME OF THEM--

19:57.327 --> 19:59.469
- SOME OF THEM SEEM EDIBLE.
- ( exhales )

19:59.469 --> 20:02.532
- THAT ONE'S--
- IT'S FINE. WE HAVE MORE.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.534
OKAY.

20:04.534 --> 20:07.437
AND DANNY SAID HE WAS
GONNA GO PICK UP SOME
MORE PIES AT THE DINER.

20:07.437 --> 20:08.838
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK DANNY'S DONE ENOUGH.

20:08.838 --> 20:11.210
COME ON, RICO.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.712
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.783
ALL THREE OF US.

20:15.545 --> 20:18.548
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE GOING
TO THE FORMAL TONIGHT?

20:18.548 --> 20:19.589
WITH HIM?

20:19.589 --> 20:22.592
AFTER WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

20:22.592 --> 20:24.424
IT WAS ONE ISOLATED INCIDENT.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.996
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
IF YOU GO TONIGHT.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.658
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

20:28.658 --> 20:29.859
MY DAD WON'T LET
ANYTHING ELSE HAPPEN.

20:29.859 --> 20:33.232
WHY DO YOU WANNA GO
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.264
JUST FOR DANNY?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.338
HE'S BEEN IN JUVIE
FOR FIVE YEARS.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.570
- RIGHT.
- I JUST FEEL LIKE HE DESERVES

20:40.570 --> 20:42.241
TO HAVE SOME FUN, OKAY?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.243
HE CAN'T GO ALONE.
HE NEEDS ME THERE.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.018
OKAY, SO WE'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT THEN?

20:49.018 --> 20:51.250
SURE.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.653
OKAY.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.931
THANK YOU!

21:07.437 --> 21:08.968
DANNY.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.970
HEY.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.972
THANK YOU FOR
STEPPING IN BACK THERE.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.974
YOU KINDA KICKED SOME ASS.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.307
- JUST DOING MY JOB.
- I KNOW.

21:17.307 --> 21:19.809
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOUR
JOB INVOLVED PROTECTING ME.

21:19.809 --> 21:23.813
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR
PROTECTING EVERYONE
WHO LIVES HERE.

21:23.813 --> 21:27.657
AND YOU'RE MAKING THAT
MUCH HARDER BY BEING
AT THE FESTIVAL.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.018
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

21:29.018 --> 21:30.760
( mouths )

21:30.760 --> 21:32.792
WHERE YOU HEADED NOW?

21:32.792 --> 21:35.595
JUST BRINGING THESE PIES TO
RICO, AND THEN I'M GONNA GO
HOME,

21:35.595 --> 21:37.627
PROBABLY GET CHANGED
FOR TONIGHT.

21:37.627 --> 21:39.799
I'LL TAKE THESE TO RICO.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.632
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH
FALL FEST THIS YEAR.

21:42.632 --> 21:44.974
IT'S JO'S IDEA,

21:44.974 --> 21:46.976
BY THE WAY,
TO GO TONIGHT.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.680
SHE REALLY NEEDS THIS.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.513
SHE CAN STILL HAVE IT.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.844
JUST NOT WITH YOU.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.622
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
TO CHECK IN AND FOLLOW UP
ON DANNY'S PROGRESS.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.924
SO?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.456
HOW'S HE DOING?

22:06.456 --> 22:07.457
WELL.

22:07.457 --> 22:09.699
HE'S A SMART YOUNG MAN.

22:09.699 --> 22:11.000
YES, HE IS.

22:12.762 --> 22:14.764
AND DR. REIDY,
I AM SURE THAT
YOU'VE HEARD

22:14.764 --> 22:17.807
SOME OF THE
HATEFUL WORDS PEOPLE ARE
USING TO DESCRIBE DANNY.

22:17.807 --> 22:20.470
"MONSTER, FREAK...

22:20.470 --> 22:22.812
SOCIOPATH."

22:22.812 --> 22:25.044
I WOULDN'T LET IT
GET TO YOU, MRS. DESAI.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.876
IT'S A HEIGHTENED TIME.

22:26.876 --> 22:29.048
OH, I KNOW.
BUT AS A MOTHER,

22:29.048 --> 22:31.621
HOW SHOULD I RESPOND TO
PEOPLE CALLING HIM THAT?

22:34.023 --> 22:35.985
I'M NOT BEING CLEAR.

22:35.985 --> 22:38.858
UH...

22:38.858 --> 22:42.692
WHAT ARE THE SIGNS THAT
SOMEONE IS A SOCIOPATH?

22:42.692 --> 22:45.535
SO THAT I CAN EXPLAIN
WHY DANNY ISN'T ONE.

22:45.535 --> 22:49.038
MOST SOCIOPATHS
DON'T MURDER ANYONE.

22:49.038 --> 22:50.900
BUT THEY DO
EXHIBIT GLIBNESS,

22:50.900 --> 22:53.403
SUPERFICIAL CHARM,

22:53.403 --> 22:55.905
AN EASY ABILITY
TO LIE.

22:55.905 --> 22:59.008
- RIGHT.
- HMM, LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE?

22:59.008 --> 23:01.150
THEY LOVE RISK.

23:01.150 --> 23:04.153
THEY DON'T CONSIDER
CONSEQUENCES.

23:04.153 --> 23:07.757
THEY HAVE A TALENT
FOR IMITATING
HUMAN EMOTION.

23:07.757 --> 23:10.119
GRIEF, JOY--

23:10.119 --> 23:14.724
IT'S NEVER REAL,
BUT THEY'RE GOOD AT
MAKING YOU BELIEVE IT IS.

23:14.724 --> 23:17.727
WAS THAT HELPFUL,
MRS. DESAI?

23:19.769 --> 23:21.771
YES, DR. REIDY.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.133
THANK YOU.

23:29.439 --> 23:30.910
SO, HOW'D SHE DO?

23:30.910 --> 23:34.914
GOOD. SOLD SOME POTS,
GOT SOME CLASS SIGN-UPS.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.617
SHE'S STILL TRYING TO GET ME
TO WEAR THAT DRESS TONIGHT...

23:37.617 --> 23:39.919
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
SHE'S A HAPPY TESS.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.891
DO YOU WANNA, UH--
DO YOU WANNA STAY IN TONIGHT?

23:41.891 --> 23:44.594
MAYBE RENT A MOVIE,
GRAB SOME TAKE-OUT?

23:44.594 --> 23:46.756
OKAY. YEAH.

23:46.756 --> 23:48.998
I JUST-- I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED TO GO.

23:48.998 --> 23:51.501
DON'T PUT THIS ON ME, JO.
IF YOU WANNA GO TONIGHT,
THEN JUST GO.

23:51.501 --> 23:53.963
DANNY, I JUST--
( sighs )

23:53.963 --> 23:56.666
I JUST FEEL LIKE
IF YOU HIDE AWAY
AND ACT LIKE

23:56.666 --> 23:58.838
SOME PARIAH KILLER,
THEN YOU'RE JUST...

23:58.838 --> 24:01.511
CONFIRMING WHAT MOST
PEOPLE ALREADY THINK
ABOUT YOU.

24:01.511 --> 24:04.113
THAT'S NOT
A GOOD ENOUGH REASON
TO GO AND YOU KNOW IT.

24:08.077 --> 24:09.178
EVERYTHING OKAY?

24:09.178 --> 24:11.180
FINE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TONIGHT.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.525
OH.

24:15.525 --> 24:17.026
WHY IS THAT?

24:17.026 --> 24:18.858
DANNY CHANGED HIS MIND.

24:20.189 --> 24:21.791
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

24:23.893 --> 24:26.065
HONEY, I KNOW YOU.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.997
YOU CAN SAY YOU HATE THIS
ALL YOU WANT,

24:27.997 --> 24:30.039
BUT EVER SINCE YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING,

24:30.039 --> 24:31.871
I CAN TELL HOW HAPPY
IT'S MADE YOU.

24:45.555 --> 24:48.718
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU PROMISED TO DO ALL THIS.

24:48.718 --> 24:50.189
GUILT IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.892
SO YOU ASKED ABOUT
SOME STUPID NECKLACE.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.724
SO WHAT?

24:54.724 --> 24:57.026
WELL?

24:57.026 --> 24:58.027
HOW DO I LOOK?

24:58.027 --> 24:59.699
SEXY.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.601
MANHATTAN SEXY?

25:01.601 --> 25:02.932
( laughs )

25:02.932 --> 25:04.674
SO MY MOM KEEPS
COMPLAINING ABOUT

25:04.674 --> 25:06.876
HOW I'M WEARING
TOO MUCH MAKEUP
RIGHT NOW,

25:06.876 --> 25:08.878
BUT I'M LIKE, "MOM,
WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
THIS ISN'T THE '60s

25:08.878 --> 25:11.641
WITH THESE BRA-LESS WONDERS
AND THE NO MAKEUP."

25:11.641 --> 25:13.042
LIKE, THIS IS NEW YORK.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.644
I'M GONNA BE GOING
TO BROADWAY,

25:14.644 --> 25:17.647
I'M GONNA BE SEEING THESE
REALLY CUTE BROADWAY BOYS.

25:17.647 --> 25:19.518
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
THEY'RE ALL GAY,

25:19.518 --> 25:22.021
BUT IF ANYONE
COULD TURN THEM,
IT WOULD BE ME.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.954
AS LONG AS I HAVE A LOT
OF MAKEUP AND THE DRESS

25:24.954 --> 25:27.627
AND THE ATTITUDE
AND THE MOVES--

25:27.627 --> 25:29.629
WHAT'S WRONG?

25:29.629 --> 25:32.101
I LOOK LIKE A WHORE,
DON'T I?

25:32.101 --> 25:34.003
( voice breaking )
WHAT IS IT? IS IT
TOO MUCH LIP GLOSS?

25:34.003 --> 25:36.666
NO, PHOEBE.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

25:36.666 --> 25:38.137
( quietly )
OKAY.

26:07.597 --> 26:09.939
WOW. YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

26:09.939 --> 26:12.241
- HOW DID YOU, UM--
- OH, ME?

26:12.241 --> 26:14.243
IT WAS ALL TESS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER.

26:14.243 --> 26:16.075
SHE WAS, LIKE,
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH

26:16.075 --> 26:17.907
WITH MOM JOY.

26:17.907 --> 26:19.909
I BET.

26:19.909 --> 26:22.612
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO GO.

26:22.612 --> 26:24.754
ME TOO.

26:24.754 --> 26:26.616
- BUT I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.
- LOOK--

26:26.616 --> 26:28.587
YOU WERE RIGHT.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.360
FALL FEST DID MEAN
A LOT TO ME.

26:31.360 --> 26:35.224
BUT PART OF THE REASON
WHY IT MEANT SO MUCH
WAS BECAUSE...

26:35.224 --> 26:36.996
I WAS THERE WITH YOU.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.730
COME ON, YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME DO

26:40.730 --> 26:42.271
OUR FUNNY DANCE
ALL BY MYSELF?

26:42.271 --> 26:44.273
( chuckles )

26:44.273 --> 26:46.305
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.142
( exhaling )
OKAY.

26:59.789 --> 27:01.190
YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR FATHER.

27:01.190 --> 27:02.852
YEAH.

27:02.852 --> 27:05.725
I SHOULD. THIS IS
ONE OF HIS OLD SUITS.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.227
AMAZING IT FITS ME, HUH?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.899
I'M GLAD YOU KEPT IT.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.633
COULD YOU, UH--

27:14.633 --> 27:16.635
COULD YOU HELP ME
WITH THIS?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.869
JO'S WAITING OUT FRONT
AND SHE GETS A LITTLE IMPATIENT.

27:19.869 --> 27:22.341
DIDN'T YOUR DAD EVER
TEACH YOU HOW TO TIE
A TIE?

27:22.341 --> 27:24.373
YEAH, I GUESS I'M JUST
OUT OF PRACTICE.

27:25.374 --> 27:28.748
NOT A LOT OF OCCASIONS
FOR FORMAL WEAR IN JUVIE.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.280
( laughs )
GOOD POINT.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.131
ALL DONE.

27:43.192 --> 27:44.864
THANKS FOR THE HELP, MOM.

27:48.237 --> 27:50.069
I'LL ALWAYS HELP YOU, DANNY.

27:51.340 --> 27:53.002
THAT'S MY JOB.

28:04.954 --> 28:08.417
- ( soft music playing )
- ( people chattering )

28:45.454 --> 28:48.457
IT'S LOVELY, ISN'T IT?

28:48.457 --> 28:51.330
REGINA ALWAYS SAID
THE FALL FESTIVAL...

28:51.330 --> 28:53.732
WAS HER FAVORITE DAY.
I KNOW.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.906
SHE'D SPEND WEEKS
LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT DRESS.

28:56.906 --> 28:59.368
IF SHE FOUND OUT
YOUR OUTFIT HAD LIKE
ONE COLOR IN COMMON,

28:59.368 --> 29:02.741
- SHE'D FORCE YOU TO
WEAR SOMETHING ELSE.
- ( chuckles softly )

29:02.741 --> 29:05.374
- SHE COULD BE SUCH
A PAIN IN THE ASS.
- ( laughs )

29:15.084 --> 29:17.226
ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

29:17.226 --> 29:21.360
YEAH, I JUST WANTED
TO COME BY AND SEE THIS.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.894
I DON'T DO VERY WELL WITH
BIG SOCIAL EVENTS THESE DAYS.

29:24.894 --> 29:28.097
I'M GLAD PEOPLE ARE
REMEMBERING HER THIS WAY.

29:28.097 --> 29:30.439
THIS...

29:30.439 --> 29:33.943
FUN, BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
HAPPY.

29:33.943 --> 29:35.945
FULL OF LIFE.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.863
OUR FALL FESTIVAL
DRAWS PEOPLE FROM
ALL OVER THE STATE.

29:53.863 --> 29:57.026
TODAY I MET A COUPLE
FROM NIAGARA FALLS.

29:57.026 --> 29:59.298
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE BIGGEST
WATERFALL IN THE WORLD,

29:59.298 --> 30:01.300
AND YOU COME TO SEE US--

30:01.300 --> 30:03.072
( murmuring )

30:07.336 --> 30:09.478
MAYOR ROLLINS,
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

30:09.478 --> 30:11.841
THANK YOU, DANNY.

30:11.841 --> 30:14.313
YOU BOTH LOOK WONDERFUL,

30:14.313 --> 30:16.315
BUT WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HEAD ON HOME, OKAY?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.988
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- CHIEF MASTERSON,
THERE YOU ARE.

30:18.988 --> 30:21.450
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN TALK
A LITTLE SENSE INTO
YOUR DAUGHTER HERE.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.451
WE DON'T WANNA
MESS ANYTHING UP,

30:22.451 --> 30:24.423
WE JUST WANNA
BE A PART OF IT.

30:26.956 --> 30:28.427
YOU CAN STAY, HONEY, BUT--

30:28.427 --> 30:30.429
IF DANNY LEAVES, I LEAVE.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.462
LOOK, WE CAN LEAVE

30:33.462 --> 30:34.563
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS
REALLY WANT.

30:34.563 --> 30:36.936
BUT IF YOU KICK US OUT,

30:36.936 --> 30:38.307
I MEAN, THAT'S
A NEWS STORY TOMORROW.

30:40.309 --> 30:42.441
I SEE, AND IT'S A--

30:42.441 --> 30:44.273
A BETTER STORY
IF YOU ATTEND?

30:44.273 --> 30:46.415
AT LEAST IT'LL BE
ABOUT FALL FEST.

30:46.415 --> 30:47.947
NOT IF THERE'S
ANOTHER DISRUPTION.

30:47.947 --> 30:48.948
Danny:
THERE WON'T BE.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.449
PEOPLE LISTEN TO YOU.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.520
THEY RESPECT YOU.

30:53.222 --> 30:55.384
SO...

30:55.384 --> 30:56.325
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

31:09.138 --> 31:10.199
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT IS TIME TO INTRODUCE

31:10.199 --> 31:12.902
THE LUCKY CONTESTANTS
CHOSEN AT RANDOM

31:12.902 --> 31:16.045
OF THIS YEAR'S FALL FEST
APPLE TOSS.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.177
HALEY LYNDON!

31:18.177 --> 31:19.308
- COME ON UP, HALEY!
- ( applause, cheers )

31:19.308 --> 31:21.380
TIM CALVERT! TIM!

31:21.380 --> 31:23.212
AND...

31:23.212 --> 31:24.984
DANNY DESAI.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.656
( murmuring )

31:27.656 --> 31:31.160
NOW SETTLE DOWN, FOLKS.
WHO ARE TO DEPRIVE ANY MAN,

31:31.160 --> 31:33.892
WOMAN OR CHILD OF
THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHT

31:33.892 --> 31:35.024
TO THROW AN APPLE
INTO A BARREL, RIGHT?

31:37.526 --> 31:40.029
OKAY, THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

31:40.029 --> 31:43.532
THE PERSON WHO THROWS
THE MOST APPLES INTO
HIS OR HER BARREL WINS.

31:43.532 --> 31:45.204
READY, SET, TOSS!

31:45.204 --> 31:47.206
- ( all cheering )
- ( upbeat music playing )

31:47.206 --> 31:48.307
GO, DANNY!

31:48.307 --> 31:50.009
GO, DESAI!

31:52.111 --> 31:53.282
COME ON, DANNY.

31:57.346 --> 31:59.188
HEY.

31:59.188 --> 32:01.320
YOU LOOK, UH... PRETTY.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.492
( chuckles )
THANKS.

32:03.492 --> 32:06.025
WOW, RICO.
YOU CLEAN UP NICE.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.456
YEAH, I, UH--

32:07.456 --> 32:09.058
I WEAR THIS SUIT
EVERY YEAR.

32:09.058 --> 32:11.530
WELL, I'M GLAD I GOT
TO SEE YOU IN IT.

32:16.105 --> 32:17.106
COME ON, DESAI!

32:17.106 --> 32:19.108
JUST GET A RHYTHM GOING.

32:26.215 --> 32:28.377
OKAY, TIME IS UP!

32:28.377 --> 32:30.549
THAT'S IT.
ALL RIGHT, JUDGES.

32:30.549 --> 32:34.523
WHO'S THE WINNER
OF THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL
FALL FEST APPLE TOSS?

32:34.523 --> 32:36.185
- WHOO!
- YOU KNOW, I WAS
CATCHING UP TO YOU

32:36.185 --> 32:38.187
TOWARDS THE END THERE.
YOU WANNA CUT A DEAL?

32:39.258 --> 32:40.589
SPLIT THE PRIZE?

32:40.589 --> 32:42.591
OR NOT, THAT'S COOL.

32:42.591 --> 32:45.264
OH-HO! FOLKS.
BY A LANDSLIDE...

32:45.264 --> 32:47.136
OUR WINNER IS
TIM CALVERT!

32:47.136 --> 32:48.437
( all cheering )

32:48.437 --> 32:49.968
YEAH, BABY!

32:54.043 --> 32:55.344
WOW.

32:55.344 --> 32:57.606
YOU REALLY SUCKED AT THAT.

32:57.606 --> 32:59.978
YOU KNOW, CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL.
I'LL GET HIM NEXT YEAR, IT'S
FINE.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.510
MM-HMM. YEAH, YEAH.

33:03.752 --> 33:05.684
EVERYTHING'S GOING
PRETTY SMOOTHLY.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.685
THAT WAS WELL-HANDLED, JOHN.

33:09.318 --> 33:12.191
IF YOU'D DONE YOUR JOB,
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO HANDLE IT.

33:17.026 --> 33:18.027
LOOK AT OUR GIRL.

33:18.027 --> 33:20.599
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.630
SHE IS.

33:30.639 --> 33:32.681
HELLO, CHIEF MASTERSON.

33:32.681 --> 33:34.183
DANNY.

33:34.183 --> 33:36.515
JO, YOU JUST--

33:36.515 --> 33:38.617
I CAN'T GET OVER YOU
IN THIS DRESS.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.789
YEAH. MAYBE TRY.

33:42.351 --> 33:43.652
YOU DID A REALLY
GREAT JOB, MOM.

33:43.652 --> 33:46.325
THANKS.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.696
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT
AGAIN SOMETIME.

33:47.696 --> 33:50.028
OH, HONEY.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.061
- YOUR HAIR.
- WHAT?

33:52.061 --> 33:54.063
- IT'S NOT--
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

33:56.435 --> 33:59.168
LOOK, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO DEFY YOU.

33:59.168 --> 34:01.140
THEN WHY DID YOU COME?

34:01.140 --> 34:04.613
YOUR DAUGHTER, SIR,
SHE CAN BE VERY CONVINCING.

34:04.613 --> 34:06.375
Tess: HERE.

34:06.375 --> 34:09.648
JUST TAKE IT.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.650
IN CASE YOU WANNA ADD
A LITTLE COLOR LATER.

34:13.082 --> 34:14.753
OKAY.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.156
- COME ON.
- BYE.

34:21.290 --> 34:22.331
I'M GONNA WALK AROUND.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.193
OKAY.

34:24.193 --> 34:25.494
- YOU WANT ME TO--
- NO.

34:25.494 --> 34:27.196
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.244
THANK YOU.

34:39.248 --> 34:40.849
HEY.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.852
JO, THAT DRESS IS AMAZING.

34:43.852 --> 34:45.684
THANKS.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.855
YOU LOOK GOOD TOO.

34:48.217 --> 34:49.218
YEAH, YOU REALLY DO.

34:50.759 --> 34:52.591
SO, ARE YOU HERE
BY YOURSELF?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.393
MY MOM AND SISTER
ARE SOMEWHERE.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.864
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO HANG OUT WITH US.

34:55.864 --> 34:57.266
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT
DOING OUR FUNNY DANCE.

34:57.266 --> 34:59.528
- REMEMBER?
- WAIT, YOU'RE NOT--

34:59.528 --> 35:00.629
OH, WE'RE GOING FOR IT.

35:00.629 --> 35:02.131
( chuckles )

35:03.832 --> 35:05.734
THANKS, BUT I HAVE

I GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT'S UP?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.491
WHAT'S ALL THE SECRECY?

37:53.942 --> 37:55.974
THIS WAS SENT TO REGINA?
WHEN?

37:55.974 --> 37:58.607
IT WAS POSTMARKED
TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED.

37:58.607 --> 38:00.579
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
TO THE POLICE.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.810
- NO, I CAN'T.
- COME ON.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.482
CHIEF MASTERSON IS
TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.983
I CAN'T! NOT YET.

NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

38:06.655 --> 38:08.817
WHAT IF IT DOES?

38:08.817 --> 38:12.391
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST NOT READY TO
SCREW WITH HOW EVERYONE--

38:12.391 --> 38:14.563
HOW THEY ALL REMEMBER REGINA.

38:14.563 --> 38:17.326
I OWE IT TO HER TO FIND OUT
WHAT THIS MEANS FIRST.

38:17.326 --> 38:19.668
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO SENT THIS!

38:19.668 --> 38:20.899
YOU AND ME,
WE HAVE TO GO--

38:20.899 --> 38:22.401
AND JO-- I'M NOT
KEEPING THIS FROM HER.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.572
HER DAD'S
THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

38:23.572 --> 38:25.073
I'M NOT KEEPING
THIS FROM HER!

38:32.511 --> 38:35.013
WHY DO YOU WANNA MEET
LIKE THIS?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.985
HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO MEET?

38:36.985 --> 38:39.518
YOU COULD HAVE TEXTED ME,
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED ME,

38:39.518 --> 38:41.350
YOU COULD HAVE TALKED
TO ME IN THE SCHOOL.

38:41.350 --> 38:42.991
WHY LIKE THIS?

38:42.991 --> 38:45.524
UNLESS...

38:46.625 --> 38:48.457
UNLESS YOU WANNA
GET ME ALONE.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.761
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW YOU.

38:52.761 --> 38:54.603
LACEY, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

39:03.071 --> 39:04.072
( sighs )

39:04.072 --> 39:05.374
LACEY, WAIT WAIT WAIT.

39:18.487 --> 39:19.628
HEY.

39:19.628 --> 39:21.630
HI.

39:21.630 --> 39:23.962
SO DANNY AND I
ARE MEETING UP
AT THE DINER SOON.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.664
DO YOU WANNA JOIN?

39:25.664 --> 39:26.865
NO, THANKS.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.439
MY FEET ARE PRETTY
UNCOMFORTABLE IN THESE SHOES.

39:30.439 --> 39:32.901
I THINK THEY'RE GIVING ME,
LIKE, A BUNION OR SOMETHING.

39:32.901 --> 39:36.445
IT'S LIKE CHAFING ON
THE FLESH OF MY BIG TOE.

39:36.445 --> 39:38.046
- SO MY MOM PUT SOME VAS--
- OKAY.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.708
- TOO MUCH.
- ( quietly ) OKAY.

39:39.708 --> 39:42.451
OKAY, WELL, I'LL JUST
SEE YOU LATER THEN.

39:45.414 --> 39:48.417
WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM?

39:48.417 --> 39:50.459
HE LIED TO US,
LIKE, A LOT.

39:50.459 --> 39:52.961
REGINA HAD HIS
AUNT TARA'S NECKLACE?

39:52.961 --> 39:55.123
HE DIDN'T LIE,

39:55.123 --> 39:57.626
HE JUST--
HE JUST DIDN'T TELL US.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.628
IT'S THE SAME THING.

39:59.628 --> 40:01.600
DANNY AND I HAVE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS SINCE WE
WERE BORN.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.072
I'M JUST NOT GONNA
GIVE UP ON HIM.

40:07.175 --> 40:09.137
I GOTTA GO HOME.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.810
OKAY. WELL, DO YOU WANT
MY PARENTS TO GIVE YOU A RIDE?

40:11.810 --> 40:12.881
NO, I CAN WALK.

40:12.881 --> 40:14.443
I THOUGHT YOUR FEET
WERE LIKE--

40:14.443 --> 40:15.714
I'LL BE FINE.

40:23.852 --> 40:25.153
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
SOME COFFEE?

40:25.153 --> 40:26.154
NO, THANK YOU.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.129
OKAY, JUST SAY WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND, KYLE.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.801
YOU DIDN'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH
THE WHOLE DRIVE HOME.

40:34.503 --> 40:35.634
HE'S TAKING YOUR CLASS.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.966
I SAW THE SIGN-UP SHEET

40:37.966 --> 40:39.638
WHEN YOU CAME BACK
THIS AFTERNOON.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.640
FINE. YOU WANT ME
TO CALL DANNY

40:41.640 --> 40:42.811
AND KICK HIM OUT
OF THE CLASS?

40:42.811 --> 40:43.972
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE CLASS.

40:43.972 --> 40:45.674
THEN WHAT'S IT ABOUT, KYLE?

40:45.674 --> 40:47.215
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

40:48.717 --> 40:51.049
SHE WAS SO HAPPY TONIGHT.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.121
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT GIRL
IN A WHILE.

40:53.121 --> 40:55.654
GEE, I WONDER WHY THAT IS.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.955
I KNOW YOU BLAME DANNY
FOR EVERYTHING,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.588
BUT HIM COMING BACK HERE--
IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HER.

40:59.588 --> 41:02.691
MY GOD, TESS!
YOU'RE BEING CHARMED BY
A FREAKING PSYCHOPATH!

41:02.691 --> 41:03.992
DON'T YELL AT ME.

41:03.992 --> 41:05.664
HE KILLED SOMEONE.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.766
HE WRAPPED A JUMP ROPE
AROUND HER NECK,

41:07.766 --> 41:09.638
AND STRANGLED THE LIFE
OUT OF HER.

41:09.638 --> 41:10.969
BUT WHATEVER, RIGHT?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.501
HE'S GOTTEN
OUR DAUGHTER
TO WEAR A DRESS.

41:12.501 --> 41:14.803
WHO CARES THAT HE
MOST LIKELY KILLED
A SECOND PERSON--

41:14.803 --> 41:16.805
A PERSON
JO'S AGE THIS TIME.

41:16.805 --> 41:18.647
IF IT'S SO OBVIOUS
DANNY DID THAT,

41:18.647 --> 41:20.609
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU
FIND ANY EVIDENCE?

41:20.609 --> 41:21.850
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.682
I'M HEARING IT FROM
MY DAUGHTER, THE TOWN,

41:23.682 --> 41:26.214
- THE MAYOR AND NOW MY WIFE.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?!

41:26.214 --> 41:28.717
THAT YOU'RE WITH ME!
THAT YOU WANNA HELP ME,

41:28.717 --> 41:30.619
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT
OUR DAUGHTER'S SAFETY.

41:33.221 --> 41:36.064
I CARE ABOUT JO'S SAFETY
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU.

41:36.064 --> 41:38.196
IT SURE DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE IT.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.100
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME

41:42.100 --> 41:44.573
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
SOLVE YOUR CASE.
