Cruella:
It's impossible!
Unacceptable!

01:12.920 --> 01:14.920
Intolerable!

01:14.920 --> 01:18.080
I am Cruella de Vil!

01:18.080 --> 01:21.880
My name is synonymous
with wealth!

01:21.880 --> 01:24.460
But your fall designs
fell flat.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.960
Especially these...
cheese shoes!

01:27.960 --> 01:31.330
Our only seller
was the Cruella de Vil
Halloween costume.

01:31.330 --> 01:35.120
And according
to my computations,
profits are down.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.170
Down?

01:37.170 --> 01:39.330
Down?

01:42.040 --> 01:44.170
Down?
Well, of course.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.920
It's quite clear to me
my profits are less "up"

01:46.920 --> 01:49.040
than they should be.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.790
Well, that's easily remedied.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.620
Isn't it, Scorch?

01:53.620 --> 01:55.170
You're fired!

01:55.170 --> 01:56.790
-Ahh!

02:00.620 --> 02:03.500
Oh, what am I to do, Scorch?

02:03.500 --> 02:07.960
If I don't have money,
my life is without meaning.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.080
Hmm. Perhaps Anita
should work harder.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.580
Those cheese shoes
were her idea.

02:14.580 --> 02:19.290
I wonder
what they're up to today
over at Barkingham Palace.

02:19.290 --> 02:21.080
-Oh!

02:21.080 --> 02:23.290
Confound this stupid thing!

02:23.290 --> 02:26.500
Ah, look at that!

02:26.500 --> 02:29.170
A picnic.

02:29.170 --> 02:33.750
How can they afford
such extravagance?

02:33.750 --> 02:36.040
So that's
where my money's going!

02:37.830 --> 02:40.170
Here I am,
nearly destitute,

02:40.170 --> 02:41.920
practically in the poor house.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.920
And they're tra-la-la-ing
about eating coleslaw
and kibble!

02:45.920 --> 02:48.880
Oh, look out, Scorch!

02:50.960 --> 02:54.830
How can she be having fun
on the salary I pay her?

02:54.830 --> 02:58.290
Unless... unless...

03:00.040 --> 03:02.960
(blows raspberry,
snickers)

03:02.960 --> 03:06.920
Scorch, Anita must be
making money moonlighting!

03:06.920 --> 03:08.880
Freelancing--
something on the side!

03:08.880 --> 03:12.040
I want you to find out
what it is.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.000
Oh!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.750
Why do bad things
always happen

03:23.750 --> 03:25.580
to good people?

03:36.080 --> 03:39.080
(fiddle playing,
dogs barking)

03:44.460 --> 03:45.920
Huh?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.880
Hey, illegal use of beak!

03:48.880 --> 03:51.250
Hey, nice catch, Spot.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.290
Good girl.

03:53.290 --> 03:56.500
Okay, is everybody ready?

04:18.710 --> 04:20.960
Roger:
Here we go again!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.830
He throws it,
we bring it back.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.880
He throws it again.
Geesh!

04:27.880 --> 04:31.080
Am I the only one who realizes
this is pointless?

04:35.790 --> 04:38.500
-Scorch!
-He's got our Frisbee!

04:38.500 --> 04:39.830
Let's get him!

04:39.830 --> 04:41.880
Ahh!

04:44.880 --> 04:47.880
Yeah, well, at least
he's worth chasing!

05:11.620 --> 05:14.710
-He's getting away!
-Not for long!

05:24.290 --> 05:27.710
Ooh, I'm picking up
negative energy.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.330
Oh, I don't see him
anywhere.

05:35.330 --> 05:38.250
-That's because
he's hiding, Spot.
-Duh!

05:38.250 --> 05:41.670
It's not like
he's going to fly
right in front of our faces.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.710
Ahhh!

05:43.710 --> 05:45.670
-Good kick.
-Thank you.

05:45.670 --> 05:48.330
Come on,
we've got him cornered!

05:49.420 --> 05:52.000
Give it up, Scorch!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.120
You're dog meat.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.330
Ahh!

06:07.750 --> 06:10.710
Ooch!
That hurt just watching.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.290
Pfft! Pfft!

06:28.880 --> 06:31.170
Hey, do you hear that?
Come on!

06:37.710 --> 06:40.000
-He's gone.
-Darn!

06:42.580 --> 06:45.750
Smells like a whole bag

06:45.750 --> 06:48.580
of extra-chunky dog food

06:48.580 --> 06:50.750
with gravy
and mashed potatoes

06:50.750 --> 06:54.040
and a side of onion rings!

06:55.620 --> 06:58.580
Smells more
like a tranquil pond

06:58.580 --> 07:00.750
on a summer's evening.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.120
Oh! Oh, no.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.330
It smells like
that fresh pine scent.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.420
-Boy, I love that!
-Hey!

07:10.420 --> 07:12.750
Enough with
the fragrance already.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.620
Let's find that ferret!

07:18.790 --> 07:21.170
Cruella:
Why didn't these sell?

07:21.170 --> 07:24.120
The fishnet parka,
the form-fitting jelly jumper,

07:24.120 --> 07:26.330
the watermelon-shaped
reversible overcoat!

07:26.330 --> 07:28.210
I just don't understand!

07:28.210 --> 07:30.210
The public just doesn't
have any taste.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.580
That's the problem.

07:31.580 --> 07:34.710
They need things
crammed down their throats.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.420
Or perhaps their noses.

07:39.420 --> 07:44.210
Scorch, you smell divine!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.330
What is that glorious smell?

07:48.330 --> 07:50.540
It smells like--
like--

07:50.540 --> 07:55.040
like freshly minted
$1,000 bills!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.580
What a fantastically
fabulous scent!

07:57.580 --> 07:59.380
It's so bracing!

07:59.380 --> 08:01.380
So inspiring!

08:03.040 --> 08:06.880
So capable
of making me millions.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.500
It will be the next hit
from the House of de Vil.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.330
My very own perfume!

08:13.330 --> 08:16.710
But what shall I call it?
Hmm.

08:16.710 --> 08:20.080
It's thrilling,
I discovered it.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.380
I'll call it Thrill by me!

08:23.380 --> 08:27.380
No. Better yet--
Thrill by de Vil!

08:27.380 --> 08:29.790
You must lead me

08:29.790 --> 08:32.620
to where you found
this fabulous fragrance.

08:35.420 --> 08:37.000
You sure you didn't see him?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.920
Be honest, Lucky.
You're not really
looking for Scorch.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.670
You just wanted an excuse
to talk to me, right?

08:44.670 --> 08:48.040
Come here, let me count
those spots for you.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.880
Come on, move it, Scorch!

08:59.670 --> 09:00.750
Ha!

09:03.670 --> 09:05.750
Here?
It's here?

09:05.750 --> 09:07.880
Here in this stinking pit

09:07.880 --> 09:11.830
of filthy, revolting
barnyard beasts?

09:13.710 --> 09:18.080
Daddy!
She called us beasts.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.540
Hurry up, Scorch!
Before I pass out.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.250
-Hmm.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.880
Are you sure this is it?
Are you absolutely positive?

09:39.420 --> 09:43.620
-Ugh!

09:43.620 --> 09:47.540
Oh! Oh, this is awful.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.250
If I didn't know better,
Scorch,

09:53.250 --> 09:55.330
I'd say you did that
on purpose.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.580
But I'm sure
you know better.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.500
Now get going!

09:59.500 --> 10:01.540
And you'd better
be right this time.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.880
Oh, what's he up to?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.620
I don't know.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.830
Let's find out.

10:08.830 --> 10:12.790
Out of my way,
you filthy beasts!

10:14.500 --> 10:16.380
Ah, yes.

10:16.380 --> 10:20.040
We're finally
getting somewhere.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.380
So that's the sweet smell.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.210
A field
of underground mushrooms,

10:25.210 --> 10:27.290
just ripe
for harvesting.

10:29.330 --> 10:31.420
Oh! I'm stuck!

10:31.420 --> 10:35.540
Oh! Oh!
Somebody get me out!

10:35.540 --> 10:39.670
-It's only neighborly.

10:41.670 --> 10:46.460
-Ahhh!

10:46.460 --> 10:49.460
I hate cows.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.330
Memo to myself--

10:51.330 --> 10:54.420
Call Horace and Jasper.
Get them over here

10:54.420 --> 10:56.460
and have them get me
those mushrooms.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.540
Now the only thing
that stands between me

11:00.540 --> 11:05.380
and my millions
is that barn.

11:11.790 --> 11:14.000
Oh, what's Cruella gonna do?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.580
It's got to be something bad.

11:16.580 --> 11:20.000
I think she's gonna tear down
the b-b-barn!

11:20.000 --> 11:23.250
She'll do anything
when there's money to be made.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.580
She's pure evil.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.750
No one's truly evil,
Lucky.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.880
Deep, deep down,
even a witch like Cruella

11:31.880 --> 11:33.920
just wants to be loved.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.330
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

11:42.420 --> 11:44.920
Hey, wake up and worry
like everyone else.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.830
Uh?

11:46.830 --> 11:48.830
What are we gonna do?

11:48.830 --> 11:51.960
We are not going
to waste our time worrying.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.880
We're a team.
Together we can--

11:57.250 --> 11:59.830
-The ceiling is falling!

11:59.830 --> 12:02.880
The ceiling is falling!
Whhaaaa!

12:04.920 --> 12:06.460
Everybody out!

12:20.040 --> 12:22.040
Quick, hide!

12:22.040 --> 12:23.830
Ahh!

12:28.120 --> 12:31.080
What are we doing this for?

12:31.080 --> 12:35.290
Cruella needs these mushrooms
to make her perfume.

12:35.290 --> 12:38.920
How much are we getting paid
for this?

12:38.920 --> 12:41.880
She's giving us something
better than money.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.620
She's cutting us in
on the deal.

12:44.620 --> 12:48.170
And I made sure
it was 5% of net,

12:48.170 --> 12:50.330
not gross.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.670
-You bet!

12:52.670 --> 12:55.880
Why, Cruella wrote up
our contract herself.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.830
We've got to stop them.

12:59.830 --> 13:03.250
Um, how are we going
to do that?

13:07.710 --> 13:10.420
I got an idea.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.420
Help me with these.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.540
I'm gonna see
if the coast is clear.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.210
Okay.
Ready? Aim,

13:27.210 --> 13:30.120
fire!

13:37.670 --> 13:39.080
That was easy.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.790
Those meddling mutts!

13:41.790 --> 13:44.880
Come on, Horace.
They can't outsmart us.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.710
Uh-oh.
Hard hats.

13:50.710 --> 13:52.830
Time for Plan B.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.120
Engage!

14:05.330 --> 14:08.500
Oh, oh, oh!

14:26.750 --> 14:29.250
Hey, Jasper, look!

14:29.250 --> 14:31.670
Ahhh!

14:40.210 --> 14:42.290
-Ha! We got 'em.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.620
Oh, and I was worried.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.330
Nice valve work, Cadpig.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.330
Uh-oh,
they're back.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.920
Raincoats was a good idea,
Jasper.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.880
So much for Plan B.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.250
B

15:05.250 --> 15:06.960
Of course!

15:08.000 --> 15:10.420
I'm not so sure
this was a good idea.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.620
Lucky:
Just keep running!

15:12.620 --> 15:16.620
Eh, here come
those pesky pups again.

15:16.620 --> 15:21.040
Looks like
they're bringing something
so's to plug up our hole.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.960
Well, I'll just take it
from 'em.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.080
Okay, now!

15:27.080 --> 15:30.040
I got it, I got it!

15:30.040 --> 15:32.500
Uh-oh!

15:33.920 --> 15:37.170
Both:
Yahhh!

15:41.750 --> 15:44.170
Yay!
We did it!

15:44.170 --> 15:47.210
Ha, ha, ha!
They're gone!

15:47.210 --> 15:50.620
Yeah!
We saved the barn!

15:52.460 --> 15:55.380
Cruella:
What? You mean to tell me

15:55.380 --> 15:58.420
you were defeated
by some mongrels
and a drumstick?

15:58.420 --> 16:01.380
What am I paying you for
if you can't get the job done?

16:01.380 --> 16:06.120
Well, now technically,
you're not paying us.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.290
You're giving us
a percentage.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.380
Don't bore me
with the details.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.250
Get me those mushrooms.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.920
My investors will be here
in half an hour.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.250
-But how are we--
-Do whatever it takes.

16:19.250 --> 16:23.040
I don't care.
Tear down the entire barn
if you have to!

16:23.040 --> 16:24.580
Now get out!

16:30.920 --> 16:32.290
Hello?

16:32.290 --> 16:34.710
That's right, darling.

16:34.710 --> 16:38.120
5:00.
And bring your checkbook.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.960
This investment opportunity
has the smell of success

16:42.960 --> 16:45.580
all over it.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.170
Ah, you were right, Lucky.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.830
My fears were groundless.
There I was,

16:54.830 --> 16:57.460
worrying Cruella
would tear down the barn.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.460
-But I should have just--

17:02.250 --> 17:03.750
Bulldozer!

17:11.380 --> 17:13.710
I'm out of here.

17:13.710 --> 17:15.460
No, we stay.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.210
-'Cause we can't give in.

17:23.880 --> 17:28.080
Ooh, Lucky,
I hate to leave you flat.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.420
But, um...

17:33.540 --> 17:35.000
Bye!

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
What's that?

17:42.040 --> 17:44.880
Just one of those
spotted flea bags,

17:44.880 --> 17:46.460
too stubborn to move.

17:50.500 --> 17:55.250
He's gonna get killed.
We've got to stop
the bulldozer.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.580
All:
Ahh!

18:00.540 --> 18:02.250
Aw!

18:06.920 --> 18:08.210
You can't!

18:14.920 --> 18:18.710
We're being paid
to do this job.

18:18.710 --> 18:21.290
But we can't run down
a little doggie.

18:21.290 --> 18:23.290
Well, if you don't
have the guts to do it,

18:23.290 --> 18:25.290
then get out!

18:27.670 --> 18:29.880
-The door's open.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.750
Oh!

18:36.750 --> 18:39.210
Think you can stop
old Jasper, eh?

18:39.210 --> 18:43.500
Eh?
Well, it ain't gonna work!

18:48.960 --> 18:51.040
Hey, wait!

18:57.960 --> 18:59.960
Cruella:
Douglas, darling!

18:59.960 --> 19:03.210
I'm thrilled--
absolutely thrilled
you could come.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.830
Jane, you look fabulous
in that outfit.

19:05.830 --> 19:08.000
Either you've lost weight
or it's one of mine.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Grayson, do you need a pen
to go with that checkbook?

19:13.460 --> 19:14.880
Where are they?

19:36.620 --> 19:40.830
Eh, get away from me,
you dumb mutts!

19:40.830 --> 19:43.380
My investors are here.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.250
If Horace and Jasper
don't get those mushrooms,

19:46.250 --> 19:49.880
my whole presentation
will smell of failure!

19:51.500 --> 19:54.670
Here, my little powder puff.

20:12.830 --> 20:15.000
Oh, yeah!
You better run,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.580
you mangy mutts!

20:20.250 --> 20:22.460
You were all too darling

20:22.460 --> 20:24.830
to show up
on such short notice.

20:24.830 --> 20:27.080
And since you've been
so kind to me,

20:27.080 --> 20:30.750
-I would like
to return the favor.
-Hmm.

20:30.750 --> 20:35.000
I want to share with you
a most remarkable discovery.

20:36.790 --> 20:39.960
A lot of help you were.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.580
Where's the bulldozer?

20:42.580 --> 20:44.920
Never mind.
What's all that?

20:44.920 --> 20:48.170
I've got
all the mushrooms.
Give me a hand!

20:48.170 --> 20:50.420
They've got
the mushrooms.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.620
But we saved the barn.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.830
We gotta stop 'em!

20:55.830 --> 20:58.960
Say, how did you get 'em?

20:58.960 --> 21:02.000
There was a small door
at the side of the barn

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
leading under the floor.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.120
Thank goodness they took away
those awful mushrooms.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.380
Huh?

21:08.380 --> 21:11.210
Thank goodness?
Why?

21:11.210 --> 21:14.830
Those mushrooms
smelled so nice.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.000
And they stole them!

21:16.000 --> 21:19.290
-Aw, let 'em have them.

21:19.290 --> 21:22.080
In the afternoon,
that nice smell

21:22.080 --> 21:25.080
changes into something
you wouldn't believe.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.920
Last year,
it smelled so bad,

21:26.920 --> 21:29.710
we had to sleep
outside the barn
for six weeks.

21:29.710 --> 21:34.290
Imagine a mushroom
so fragrant, it glows!

21:37.330 --> 21:40.790
Now imagine
you're handing over
gobs and gobs of money.

21:40.790 --> 21:45.080
I mean--
I mean, investing
in what will surely be

21:45.080 --> 21:47.920
the most profitable
venture ever

21:47.920 --> 21:50.120
from the House of de Vil!

21:50.120 --> 21:52.750
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:52.750 --> 21:57.880
I proudly present
Thrill by de Vil!

22:02.830 --> 22:04.790
It shouldn't be long now.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.290
-Cruella: Wait! Don't go!

22:12.290 --> 22:16.620
-Don't go! Come back!
