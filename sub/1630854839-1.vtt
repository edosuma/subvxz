This shouldn't take long.

01:44.050 --> 01:46.190
Just a simple exit interview
recapping the season.

01:46.390 --> 01:49.060
- You know the drill.
- JAMIE: No problem.

01:49.260 --> 01:50.400
Great. Let's jump right in.

01:50.590 --> 01:54.520
I mean, of course there was added pressure
after I won season two,

01:54.720 --> 01:57.350
and I imagine there'll be even more
after winning again this season,

01:57.550 --> 02:00.150
'cause there's
certain expectations now, right?

02:00.340 --> 02:04.080
Like, I have to maintain,
uh, a level of perfection.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.120
Does that make it difficult to have
any semblance of a life outside of work?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.600
Uh, somewhat.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.980
Like with your relationships?

02:14.180 --> 02:16.080
I read that Pria's dating again.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.230

was busy fucking each other,

02:57.640 --> 03:00.650

'cause I wasn't here to make friends.

at the Cancun Airport.

03:12.470 --> 03:13.400
I made it.

03:13.590 --> 03:19.020
But, yeah, in the process,
I lost my partner and my best friend.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.700
But, honestly, I don't know. I mean...

03:23.290 --> 03:26.060

03:26.260 --> 03:29.230
which path I went down,

03:29.430 --> 03:32.250
I would've felt like
I was sacrificing something.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.080
Yeah.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.270

- The silence.

03:49.590 --> 03:51.150
Yes! It works every time.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.440
I didn't know Pria was dating again.
Where did you read that?

03:53.640 --> 03:55.730
I didn't, but it made for
a good interview.

- Mm. So special.

04:02.300 --> 04:05.270

to end the season.

- (laughter)

04:07.180 --> 04:09.690
- Ah, yeah, so good.

And we'd love to talk to you
about the future of the show,

04:12.680 --> 04:13.650
- if you have a minute.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.520
Absolutely. I was actually gonna start
brainstorming ideas this weekend.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.060
- (grunts)
- Oh, my God, classic Ally.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.060
- No days off.
- Yes, we love your work ethic.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.940
RAMONA: So, yeah, as we look forward,
we started to look back,

04:22.140 --> 04:25.150
- and season one was here... (laughs)
- (chuckles)

04:25.340 --> 04:28.270
and season two was here-- a little lower--

04:28.470 --> 04:31.900
and season three, you know, based on
the few episodes that have already aired,

04:32.090 --> 04:35.440
we're actually coming in... here.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.600

it's below the genital area.

Your genitals or my genitals?

- 'Cause it's my...

04:41.550 --> 04:42.650

- Are those your genitals?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.980
Well, these-these are my genitals here,
so... (stammers)

04:45.180 --> 04:47.310
Transpose my genitals onto your pants.

04:47.510 --> 04:49.150
- It's, like, below that.
- But where do they start?

Uh, I think it's time for you
to take your man home.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.580
- He's about to pick a fight
with the pool table. -Ah. (laughs)

53:41.450 --> 53:42.520
Fuck.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.650
Baby, let's get out of here!

53:44.840 --> 53:47.020
I want to go home
and take advantage of you.

53:51.470 --> 53:52.690
It was nice talking to you.

53:52.890 --> 53:54.400
You, too.

53:54.590 --> 53:56.830
I guess I'll see you tomorrow?

54:08.640 --> 54:10.600
Mm-hmm. That was a good one.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.310
That was a good one.

54:13.510 --> 54:15.270
Okay, where is everyone meeting tomorrow
and what time?

54:15.470 --> 54:17.230
You've lost your mind.

54:17.430 --> 54:19.310
Did you see that look she just gave me?

54:19.510 --> 54:21.230
Pulling that flirty shit with Sean
in front of my face?

54:21.430 --> 54:22.850
She's challenging me.

54:23.050 --> 54:25.730
Yeah, pretty crazy to show your fiancé
that kind of affection.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.400
Whose side are you on?

54:27.590 --> 54:29.190
Oh, come on.
Don't put me in the middle of this.

54:29.390 --> 54:30.900
This has been really fun having you here.

54:31.090 --> 54:33.600
It's been a great surprise,
but shit gets real tomorrow.

54:33.800 --> 54:37.000
Exactly, and they're counting on me
to be there to film it all.

54:38.790 --> 54:41.770
Okay, whatever. You think I can't
get the info from anyone else here?

54:41.970 --> 54:44.120
- (groans)
- Yo, Jer!

54:45.580 --> 54:47.060
Yo. What's up, A-dog?

54:47.260 --> 54:48.980
You want to ping-pong
some rhymes back and forth?

54:49.180 --> 54:51.270
Maybe. Just come here.

54:51.470 --> 54:53.480
Coming.

54:53.680 --> 54:54.690
What's up?

54:54.890 --> 54:56.730
I lost my itinerary for the weekend.

54:56.930 --> 54:58.400
Can you remind me
where we're all meeting up tomorrow?

54:58.590 --> 55:00.020
Yeah, you just go to the wedding website.

55:00.220 --> 55:01.770
It's Pornhub.com.

55:01.970 --> 55:03.480
(Jeremy laughs)

55:03.680 --> 55:04.810
- I'm kidding.
- (Ally laughs)

55:05.010 --> 55:07.770
Don't... don't tell Mel I said that.

55:07.970 --> 55:09.400
She doesn't like that stuff. (sighs)

55:09.590 --> 55:10.850
- This guy gets it. Boom!
- (groans)

55:11.050 --> 55:13.790
Okay, one sec.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.480
(sighs)

55:16.680 --> 55:18.020
Pretty fucking cute.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.400
- What's cute?
- Nothing.

55:20.590 --> 55:22.230
Listen, I need you to find
some people for me,

55:22.430 --> 55:25.730
an older couple in Seattle,
probably in their 60s.

55:25.930 --> 55:28.100
The parents of Cassidy Rivers.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.770
Oh, fuck me, they're getting married
at the Alderwood?

55:30.970 --> 55:31.850
KAYLA:
What's happening?

55:32.050 --> 55:33.440
I'm gonna forward you an itinerary.

55:33.640 --> 55:36.540
- I need you to get it to this couple ASAP.
- On it.

55:37.790 --> 55:39.310
Shit, what am I doing?

55:39.510 --> 55:41.730
- You know what? Don't send that.
- Oh, guess what.

55:41.930 --> 55:44.730
There might be some interest
in a new season of the show.

55:44.930 --> 55:46.980
Wait, what? What are you talking about?

55:47.180 --> 55:49.480
So, my friend started working
at this new streaming service,

55:49.680 --> 55:51.270
and I told her that the show got canceled.

55:51.470 --> 55:54.100
- Oh, great, tell the whole town.
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.900
But she then-- she mentioned it
to her boss, who got, like, really excited

55:57.090 --> 55:58.730
and wants to hop on the phone
with you tomorrow

55:58.930 --> 56:00.270
'cause they're, like,
desperate for content,

56:00.470 --> 56:03.350
and maybe they could save the show.

56:03.550 --> 56:05.060
Sorry if I overstepped my bounds.

56:05.260 --> 56:08.000
No, no, no, no. It's good, it's good.
Uh, just let me think.

56:10.660 --> 56:12.770
It looks like I'll have some time tomorrow
before the wedding rehearsal.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.440
Let's set the call for 4:00 p.m.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.150
Who's getting married?

56:16.340 --> 56:18.020
- Sean's getting married?
- ALLY: Jesus!

56:18.220 --> 56:22.020
You know, I knew he was dating
that sweet little punk rock girl,

56:22.220 --> 56:25.400
but I-I didn't realize
they were so serious.

56:25.590 --> 56:27.980
- You know...
- Mom, do you need something?

56:28.180 --> 56:31.440
No, I-I just heard you from the other room
and thought I'd check in.

56:31.640 --> 56:34.980
I haven't seen you for more than
two minutes since you been home.

56:35.180 --> 56:37.450
It was a pretty significant two minutes.

56:39.250 --> 56:40.600
I know. I'm sorry.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.310
I-I really do want to visit with you,

56:42.510 --> 56:46.060
but first I have to leave town for this,
just for a couple days.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.150
Okay. (chuckles)

56:48.340 --> 56:49.810
O-Okay, okay, yeah.

56:50.010 --> 56:53.100
Um, have a fun time,
and I'll see you when you get back.

56:53.300 --> 56:56.290
Definitely. I'm all yours when I'm back.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.580
Is, uh... everything all right?

57:01.660 --> 57:02.940
Yeah. Why?

57:03.140 --> 57:08.160
I just-- you know, if you ever
want to talk, I'm... I'm here.

57:09.500 --> 57:10.910
I know.

57:12.750 --> 57:14.560
Well...

57:14.760 --> 57:17.520
- Actually, Mom?
- Hmm?

57:17.720 --> 57:20.060
Do you have any dresses I could borrow?

57:20.260 --> 57:25.230
Oh, well... (laughs) there's a bunch
of your old stuff in your closet.

57:25.430 --> 57:27.200
Oh, perfect.

to have me here but you.

58:14.330 --> 58:16.690
I don't know. I just...

58:16.890 --> 58:19.520
I feel like I'm the one who started
this whole thing that you're doing,

58:19.720 --> 58:21.910

join the guys for the day.

- Um...
- Jules? Cyrina?

1:00:16.580 --> 1:00:18.020
- You good?
- Yeah.

1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:21.250
- Okay. Just think about
what we were saying. -Mm-hmm.

Sorry if I was interrupting something.

1:00:38.910 --> 1:00:41.250
Was it about the band?

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.120
They think you're choosing Sean
over your work?

1:00:50.370 --> 1:00:52.270
I know you probably don't care
about my opinion,

1:00:52.470 --> 1:00:56.020
but I've literally been
in your exact position.

1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:57.750
With the same guy.

1:01:01.450 --> 1:01:03.160
And?

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:10.650
(clicks tongue) I wanted to make docs,
and the opportunities were in L.A.

1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:15.350
It's like Sean had this whole idea
of what he wanted his life to look like.

1:01:15.550 --> 1:01:20.330
It was all planned out,
but then there was no room for my plans.

1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:24.620
You have no regrets?

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:29.250
I'm happier than ever.

1:01:32.870 --> 1:01:34.100
(sighs heavily)

1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:38.060
I saw how emotional you were
at the start of the show last night.

1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:40.330
You can't ignore those feelings.

1:01:42.830 --> 1:01:46.980
(sighs) I can't go lay down
for an hour right now.

1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:48.650
You smoke weed?

1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:52.100
Hmm? (clears throat)

1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:53.230
Mm-hmm.

1:01:53.430 --> 1:01:56.100
- (Ally laughing) -So this is when we were
touring with Sleater-Kinney, right?

1:01:56.300 --> 1:02:01.560
So, the curtains open up, and
it's the three of us onstage fully nude,

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:04.060
doing our best Robin Wright
<i>Forrest Gump</i> impersonation.

1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:06.190
- No. (laughing)
- Yeah, and Cyrina-- hold on.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:08.650
Cyrina was going through
her hipster phase at the time,

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:11.230
where all she was playing
was the triangle.

1:02:11.430 --> 1:02:12.940
(laughs):
So there was not much to hide behind.

1:02:13.140 --> 1:02:14.270
(both laughing)

1:02:14.470 --> 1:02:16.480
Oh, man.

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:17.810
(sighs):
Oh!

1:02:18.010 --> 1:02:20.690
I used to do stuff like that all the time.
(coughs)

1:02:20.890 --> 1:02:22.580
Weren't you, like, a nudist?

1:02:23.700 --> 1:02:25.770
I was. Yes.

1:02:25.970 --> 1:02:27.190
- (laughs)
- That's cool.

1:02:27.390 --> 1:02:28.440
- Yeah, yeah.
- (laughs)

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:31.900
I used to, you know, really go all out
for the things I believed in.

1:02:32.090 --> 1:02:35.150
I didn't give a shit.
I just did what I wanted.

1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:37.060
And that's exactly what I'm talking about.

1:02:37.260 --> 1:02:38.600
You can't give that up.

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:41.350
I mean, I wish I didn't have to.

1:02:41.550 --> 1:02:42.980
But...

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.940
I love Sean, and like you said,

1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:48.830
he has this idea
of what his life should be.

1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:57.020
We, um...

1:02:57.220 --> 1:02:59.500
actually thought that I was pregnant.

1:03:00.790 --> 1:03:04.190
It's kind of why we got engaged
in the first place.

1:03:04.390 --> 1:03:06.900
It was super impulsive.

1:03:07.090 --> 1:03:10.980
And then we found out
that I wasn't, and...

1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:13.520
we never talked about it again.

1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:18.440
Like... if we still wanted
to get married or...

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:20.410
wait or...

1:03:22.450 --> 1:03:23.950
I don't know.

1:03:25.750 --> 1:03:27.330
I don't know.

1:03:33.910 --> 1:03:35.620
- Fuck.
- JEREMY: That counts.

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.310
You want to talk about it?

1:03:41.510 --> 1:03:42.440
(Sean sighs)

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.190
It's just... not how I thought
I would feel the day before my wedding.

1:03:47.390 --> 1:03:50.560
I don't get it, man.
You're crazy about Cassidy.

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:52.730
I mean, a couple months ago, you thought
you were gonna have a kid with her.

1:03:52.930 --> 1:03:54.190
And I'd never seen you so excited.

1:03:54.390 --> 1:03:56.560
I was. I mean, I am.

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.410
It just...

1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:02.150
...feels like she's been pulling away.

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:03.980
Okay, what do you mean?

1:04:04.180 --> 1:04:07.020
(sighs heavily) Like...

1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:08.730
I don't know,
when we thought she was pregnant,

1:04:08.930 --> 1:04:11.310
we decided she would stop touring.

1:04:11.510 --> 1:04:14.480
You know, essentially quit the band
and stay home and be a mom,

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:16.480
but now I-I don't know.

1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:18.560
It's like she got a glimpse
of what that life would be,

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:22.480
and she's having second thoughts
or something.

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:25.810
So she's saying she'd rather be
on the road than, like, try again?

1:04:26.010 --> 1:04:29.000
No, she hasn't actually said that.
It's just...

1:04:32.290 --> 1:04:34.560
It all feels too familiar. You know?

1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:38.940
I'm just scared she'll take off
like everyone else.

1:04:39.140 --> 1:04:41.310
Cassidy isn't Ally.

1:04:41.510 --> 1:04:44.040
I think you just need to talk to her.

1:04:47.290 --> 1:04:48.770
Look, he's not wrong.

1:04:48.970 --> 1:04:51.770
Being in a relationship
while on the road is fucking hard.

1:04:51.970 --> 1:04:53.190
People get jealous.

1:04:53.390 --> 1:04:56.150
The last two girls I dated
broke up with me because of it.

1:04:56.340 --> 1:04:58.600
I get it.

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:03.060
But you can't just fully close off
one whole side of yourself.

1:05:03.260 --> 1:05:04.750
That's no way to live.

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.940
I mean, you chose a path,

1:05:09.140 --> 1:05:11.450
and you're doing great, right?

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:14.730

Yeah! Titties!

1:05:39.470 --> 1:05:41.150

1:05:41.340 --> 1:05:43.190
Hey, do not be a little perv.

Hey.

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:01.980
Wait, what are you doing here?

1:06:02.180 --> 1:06:05.440
Uh, I just wanted to spend some time with
you before everything got going tonight.

1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:06.690
Yeah?

1:06:06.890 --> 1:06:08.100
You didn't want to finish your game?

1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.650
Wait, didn't I see you at the ninth hole?

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:12.900
- Uh, yeah.
- (chuckles)

1:06:13.090 --> 1:06:15.520
Yeah, what was going on
with you and Ally out there?

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:16.940
(chuckles):
What did it look like?

1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:21.190
(chuckles) No, no, it just seems like
you two are, you know, really bonding.

1:06:21.390 --> 1:06:23.230
She's actually really cool.

1:06:23.430 --> 1:06:26.850
I... I'm kind of glad she's here.

1:06:27.050 --> 1:06:28.150
Cool.

1:06:28.340 --> 1:06:29.900
- What, are you jealous?
- No.

1:06:30.090 --> 1:06:31.600
Well, don't worry.

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:34.290
I much prefer being naked with you.

1:06:40.370 --> 1:06:42.560
You okay?

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:43.940
Yeah.

1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:47.730
Yeah, I just, uh-- I wanted to talk
to you, you know, just check in.

1:06:47.930 --> 1:06:50.160
Okay, what do you want to talk about?

1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:52.730
I don't know.

1:06:52.930 --> 1:06:55.850
Um... how are you feeling?

Yeah. Good. I feel great. Yeah.

1:07:08.590 --> 1:07:11.500
Great. Then where were we?

1:07:16.870 --> 1:07:17.980
You know what? I'm sorry.

1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:22.020
I just-- I feel a little gross,
and I want to take a quick shower.

1:07:22.220 --> 1:07:23.770
- Okay.
- Cool?

1:07:23.970 --> 1:07:26.440
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:29.100
I will, uh... I'll be right back.

1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:30.950

1:07:49.620 --> 1:07:53.940
Okay, this is all happening because
they thought they were pregnant?

1:07:54.140 --> 1:07:55.940
Why didn't you tell me?

1:07:56.140 --> 1:07:58.620
(whispers):
'Cause I'm not a shitty friend.

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:03.100
- So, what, she told you?
- Yeah.

1:08:03.300 --> 1:08:06.690
Wow. Lot more going on between you two
than just naked frolicking.

1:08:06.890 --> 1:08:09.440
I was stoned, okay?

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:13.270
And somehow
we started bonding over nudity.

1:08:13.470 --> 1:08:15.980
I-- It all weirdly felt like
a natural progression.

1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:17.150
Mm-hmm.

1:08:17.340 --> 1:08:20.600
And I heard you're setting up some kind of
interview station after dinner now?

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:23.190
I thought it would be nice
to cut to talking heads during the video.

1:08:23.390 --> 1:08:24.350
I don't know.

1:08:24.550 --> 1:08:26.830
I told you she was cool.

1:08:27.910 --> 1:08:30.270
Okay, you're right. She's great.

1:08:30.470 --> 1:08:33.440
She actually reminds me
a lot of me at that age.

But I don't know.

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:08.730
But, you know, Cass, I-I don't,
I don't want to be that person anymore.

1:27:08.930 --> 1:27:10.270
I don't want to hold you back.

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:35.480

more important than us.

and I don't want to lose you, Cass.

1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:25.560

here after everything that I told you?

you insisted on shaving your head

right before
your college admission interviews?

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:30.600
And I-I begged you not to,
but you-you wouldn't back down.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:34.020
You said, "This is in solidarity
with Britney Spears.

You followed your heart,
not caring what the outcome would be,

1:33:48.010 --> 1:33:52.730
and everyone recognized that
it was coming from a... from a pure place.

1:33:52.930 --> 1:33:58.730
