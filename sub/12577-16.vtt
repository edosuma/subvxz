WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.378
(light music)

00:04.713 --> 00:06.965
(fast-paced light music)

00:32.032 --> 00:32.866
(horn honking)

00:32.949 --> 00:34.409
Oh, that's my ride.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.995
Uncle Hank, can I borrow 22.50?

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
I need eight dollars for the movie,

00:40.165 --> 00:43.209
and 2.50 for popcorn
and then 10 dollars for dinner,

00:43.293 --> 00:45.795
and, oh, I want to play the claw machine.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.549
I would give up the popcorn
to play the claw machine.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.009
(sighs)
You know, Luanne,

00:51.092 --> 00:53.219
it would be a lot less irritating

00:53.303 --> 00:55.722
to give you a round number
every now and then

00:55.805 --> 00:58.141
than hearing about every
little thing you wanted to buy.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.186
Can I have 300 dollars?

01:01.269 --> 01:03.605
(sighs)
Look, here's 60 dollars.

01:03.688 --> 01:07.776
Now, I lived for a month
on 60 dollars thanks to...

01:07.859 --> 01:11.112
LUANNE: Hey, guys! I got 60 dollars!
(giggles)

01:11.196 --> 01:13.073
You know,
by letting Luanne live like this,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.742
we send out the message that it's okay.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.036
(sighs)
Maybe that's what's wrong with Bobby.

01:18.661 --> 01:22.207
MAN (on TV): <i>Now, I can bite an apple
with confidence.</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:25.043
My Betsy left her job
at the La Grunta hotel.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.961
She could put in a good word for Luanne.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.047
-What's the job?
-MAN: Golf course drink girl.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.841
-Hm.
-I went to the La Grunta once.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.552
It cost eight dollars just to park there.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.222
You could get 200 washers for that.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.890
400 at the Mega Lo Mart.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.934
What's that supposed to mean?

01:41.017 --> 01:42.519
Now, calm down, guys.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.187
This is why I shop here.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.606
It may cost more, but it's worth it.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.441
Eight cents.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
I've got a family.

01:54.072 --> 01:57.033
Luanne, that's my helmet phone.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.036
I'm sorry,
but I can't just starve to death

02:00.120 --> 02:02.372
as convenient as that would be for you.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.624
And you won't give me any more money

02:04.707 --> 02:06.960
because I spent everything
you gave me last night.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.545
But...
(stammers)

02:08.628 --> 02:10.296
Well, you know what? It doesn't matter

02:10.380 --> 02:13.716
because I found an exciting
opportunity for you.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.179
How would you like to be
a golf course drink girl?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.349
You'd have your own money.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.018
(gasps)
My own money.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.439
Nobody making me beg
for every little penny like a dog.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.734
Uh, yep, you'd show me, all right.
(chuckles)

02:31.818 --> 02:34.904
Ooh, a golf course drink girl.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.781
Hey, why not me?

02:36.865 --> 02:37.699
Thata girl.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.034
I'll be my own boss.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.370
Uh, no, you'll have a boss,

02:42.453 --> 02:44.497
but the tips are all under the table.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
(laughing)

02:46.249 --> 02:47.333
(nervous chuckle)

02:47.417 --> 02:48.877
Uh, okay.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.839
The golfers are cheap.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.966
They think, 'cause I'm a woman,

02:55.049 --> 02:58.219
I'm supposed to be miss Merry Sunshine.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.513
Well, the hell with that.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.765
I had no idea you were a woman.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.185
Just take these drinks out to seven.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.521
As long as you can do basic math,
you'll be fine.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.773
(quirky music)

03:10.857 --> 03:12.275
LUANNE: Excuse me.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.943
Did you order these drinks?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.403
Yeah, but maybe I've had enough.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.614
You look a lot better than you did
15 minutes ago.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.073
(men laughing)

03:19.157 --> 03:20.450
I had them check my math,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.743
so I know it's right.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.538
MAN: Here you go.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.917
Okay. I can do this.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.210
Hey, it's all yours,

03:30.293 --> 03:32.128
as long as you don't let the sea hag

03:32.212 --> 03:33.338
bring our drinks anymore.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.672
(men laughing)

03:34.756 --> 03:37.008
And we can eat what's left over
from the buffet,

03:37.091 --> 03:39.344
and we get to use the kids' pool
until 7:00 a.m.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.763
Well, how do I get a job like that, huh?

03:41.846 --> 03:43.681
Oh, Aunt Peggy, I don't know.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.642
The other drink girl is a woman your age,

03:45.725 --> 03:47.685
and the golfers don't like her.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.188
I could be a golf course drink girl.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.523
(feminine voice)
Is there anything else

03:52.607 --> 03:54.442
I can get you gentlemen?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.153
Bobby, don't let your father
see you do that, honey.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.864
(squeals)
I have to thank Uncle Hank.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.532
What is the best possible present

04:01.616 --> 04:02.784
I could possibly get him?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.869
Well, I always get him pants.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.622
I got him socks one year.
Mm-mm. Never again.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.624
No, no, no, no, no. That's no good.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.252
I have to get him something
he really loves.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.129
Something that will just make him go...
Wow!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.298
(Luanne laughing)

04:19.259 --> 04:22.387
I've noticed that uncle Hank
doesn't wear any jewelry,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.681
so I'm going to get him some jewelry.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.266
That's not what he needs.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.602
I know a man who can remove
Hank's fingerprints for him.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.063
But believe me, pay the extra

04:32.146 --> 04:33.815
and get the 50 dollar job.

04:33.898 --> 04:37.235
I tell you what, man, boy, man,
dang ol' electronic assistant.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.820
I never don't miss me, man.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.196
-BOOMHAUER: Check it out.
-(beeps)

04:40.280 --> 04:42.365
BOOMHAUER (over device):
<i>Wake up about five.</i>

04:42.448 --> 04:45.410
<i>Gonna go have a bear,
then go hangin' out at auto store,</i>

04:45.493 --> 04:47.537
<i>you know, come back and take a nap maybe.</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:48.955
<i>Do something like that.</i>

04:49.038 --> 04:51.291
Oh, man, that dang ol' Wednesday, man.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.501
You know, Hank and me,
we used to go bowling,

04:53.584 --> 04:55.378
and I'd tell people we were brothers,

04:55.461 --> 04:56.671
and he was better than me,

04:56.754 --> 04:58.631
but he'd let me win sometimes,

04:58.715 --> 05:00.591
and we'd stay out way too late,

05:00.675 --> 05:03.344
and maybe if you bought him
another bowling ball...

05:03.428 --> 05:05.763
(voice breaking)
...it'd be like before Peggy came.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.145
What man doesn't like
a nice soap or candle?

05:12.228 --> 05:15.898
LUANNE: Oh, that bottle of Vicks
is really expensive.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.109
Why don't you get him a gift certificate?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.486
There are lots of things
at the hotel he can use.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.572
I bought my husband a round of golf,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.866
and our love life has never been better.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.995
LUANNE: Of course, that's it.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.456
And she said I should buy him
a round of golf,

05:31.539 --> 05:33.082
and then it was easy.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.418
Oh, Luanne, Hank loves golf.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.670
A round of golf makes
my presents look like...

05:37.754 --> 05:40.089
-Well, nothing.
-Oh, no, Aunt Peggy.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.007
Of course it does.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.092
No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
(gasps)
Surprise!

05:45.053 --> 05:47.722
(chuckles)
Well, what's this?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.098
I know it's not my birthday.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.850
I didn't get my pants from Peggy.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.268
(Hank chuckling)

05:54.854 --> 05:57.357
(laughing)

05:57.440 --> 05:59.108
Oh, my God!

05:59.192 --> 06:00.485
Look at your face!

06:00.568 --> 06:03.112
You thought it was a big box,
but it's a small box!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.447
(laughing continues)

06:04.530 --> 06:07.075
But you know what they say
about small packages.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.701
It's a round of golf.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.036
No, Bobby, no.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.455
The round of golf gave me the idea,
but it's not...

06:12.538 --> 06:14.248
A dolphin encounter?

06:14.332 --> 06:15.333
That's right.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.668
There's a dolphin in a pool at the hotel,

06:17.752 --> 06:19.462
and you can swim with it and touch it,

06:19.545 --> 06:20.880
and it communes with you,

06:20.963 --> 06:22.632
and you can feed it dead fish.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.052
Well, Luanne, this sure was
a thoughtful present,

06:26.135 --> 06:28.054
and it looks like you, uh,

06:28.137 --> 06:29.597
spent a lot of money on it.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.891
And hey, if I wanted to exchange it

06:31.974 --> 06:34.477
for that round of golf,
I could do that, right?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.522
But... you wouldn't want to replace it.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.567
(stammers)
It cost more than a round of golf.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.653
And I... I just...

06:43.736 --> 06:47.323
(sobbing)
I... I...

06:48.658 --> 06:50.243
LUANNE: Excuse me.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.206
Well, somebody should go talk to Luanne.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.751
(humming tune)

06:59.919 --> 07:01.629
(sighs)
Oh, all right.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.465
(sobbing)

07:04.549 --> 07:06.843
Well, hey, Luanne, you know what?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.971
I've never climbed into a pool
with a big fish.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.390
I guess it just never occurred to me.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.143
So maybe this dolphin confrontation

07:15.226 --> 07:17.311
would be something I'd be glad I had done

07:17.395 --> 07:18.438
after it was over.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.107
It's an encounter.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.151
Even better.
(chuckles)

07:24.569 --> 07:25.695
PEGGY: Come on, Hank.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.617
(grunts)

07:33.119 --> 07:35.455
Looks like you're going golfing.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.789
HANK: Yeah, looks like.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.126
Didn't know dolphins
knew how to play golf.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.587
(laughing)

07:42.670 --> 07:44.005
Shut up, Dale.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.429
PEGGY: They have a store
that sells red Skelton paintings.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.763
I am there.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.391
Although I do not like his clowns.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.977
(gasps)
Look at that brunch!

08:00.396 --> 08:01.731
Prime rib for breakfast?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.024
Wow, it's true.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.775
I guess I owe Bill an apology.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.402
Uncle Hank,

08:06.486 --> 08:09.655
it's time for your dolphin
encounter orientation.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.032
(Luanne chuckles)

08:11.115 --> 08:12.825
HANK: Boy, look at that beef.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.745
I never get brunch.

08:16.704 --> 08:20.791
To think of all the years
I've wasted without capers.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.543
They work with the salmon.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.420
They work with the little pickles,

08:24.504 --> 08:28.633
and I think they might work
with fruit pies.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.718
(faint music playing)

08:31.552 --> 08:32.428
(sniffing)

08:32.512 --> 08:35.348
Hello, what have we here?

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
(epic music)

08:37.642 --> 08:40.353
One man who was healed
by dolphins told me,

08:40.436 --> 08:43.523
"Angels are dolphins
who haven't learned to swim."

08:43.606 --> 08:46.275
FACILITATOR: People ask me
how to approach these wise cetaceans.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.778
And I can only say, be honest with them

08:48.861 --> 08:51.113
and they will share
their secrets with you.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.659
I'm going to lower the lights now
so we can watch our video,

08:54.742 --> 08:56.744
<i>A Dream Of Dolphins.</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:58.829
(new age music playing)

08:59.455 --> 09:02.208
WOMAN: <i>I dive into the gentle sea</i>

09:02.875 --> 09:05.586
<i>to free the dolphin inside of me.</i>

09:05.670 --> 09:07.213
(whimpers)

09:07.296 --> 09:09.423
(light music)

09:10.341 --> 09:11.551
(dolphin clicking)

09:12.927 --> 09:14.554
I don't want any photos.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.681
Go take pictures of the golf course.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.350
They can feel negative energy.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.393
Relax.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.481
(whistles)
Go!

09:25.565 --> 09:26.816
(dolphin squealing)

09:26.899 --> 09:29.318
(suspenseful music)

09:29.402 --> 09:30.736
(gasps)

09:30.820 --> 09:32.280
(dolphin chattering)

09:32.947 --> 09:34.949
Wow!
(chuckles)

09:36.075 --> 09:38.786
That was a mighty fine catch.
(chuckles)

09:38.869 --> 09:41.289
He kind of feels like rubber.
(chuckles)

09:41.372 --> 09:43.332
Hold on to Duke's fin.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.543
Let him take you.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.795
Hey, look at me.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.879
(chuckles)

09:48.963 --> 09:50.965
(epic music)

10:05.646 --> 10:09.233
Hey, Luanne,
this isn't as asinine as I thought.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.318
Thanks.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.819
(chuckling)

10:11.902 --> 10:13.779
(dolphin chattering)

10:13.863 --> 10:14.822
Boy, I tell you what,

10:14.905 --> 10:16.699
this is one...

10:16.782 --> 10:18.409
just a second, Duke.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.327
(chattering)

10:19.410 --> 10:21.412
Hey... Hey, cut it out.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.497
(suspenseful music)

10:23.581 --> 10:25.583
(sputtering)
Oh!

10:25.666 --> 10:27.084
What's going on?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.336
There's nothing wrong,

10:28.419 --> 10:30.421
but maybe you should get out
of the pool immediately.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.506
(yelling)

10:34.300 --> 10:35.259
What do I do?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.510
Have fun.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.762
Get the manager out here.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.221
-(dolphin chattering)
-(yelps)

10:42.391 --> 10:43.726
(gurgling scream)

10:46.103 --> 10:47.271
BOBBY: How's this?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.023
Well, that is perfect.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.941
-(camera shutter clicks)
-PEGGY: No, wait, wait.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.486
-One with the flash just to be safe.
-(camera shutter clicks)

10:57.865 --> 10:59.950
Excuse me. Is it safe to assume

11:00.034 --> 11:02.995
you won't be purchasing a videotape
of your dolphin encounter?

11:03.079 --> 11:05.498
Get out of here!
You're in trouble. All of you!

11:05.581 --> 11:07.917
That fish better have had its shots.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.087
Mr. Hill, I'm the food and recreation
director here at La Grunta.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.713
That thing attacked me!

11:12.797 --> 11:15.174
That's not what my niece paid for.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.425
-Is it?
-No.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.511
Is it?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.054
Y'all used me for chum.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.847
That stupid fish could have drowned me.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.557
Mr. Hill, there's no way on earth

11:23.641 --> 11:25.643
Duke would have let you drown.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.645
That dolphin loves you. A lot.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.605
That's a damn funny way to show it.

11:29.689 --> 11:34.110
Um, Mr. Hill, Duke has
the same desires we all do.

11:34.193 --> 11:38.155
With all of your fondling,
Duke became aroused

11:38.239 --> 11:40.950
and was attempting to become...

11:41.534 --> 11:43.160
physically intimate with you.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.621
Oh, my God.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.081
TRAINER: It's a compliment, really.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.999
(retching)

11:49.083 --> 11:50.960
He's not going to get away with this.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.211
Give me that tape!

11:52.294 --> 11:54.547
I'm sending this in
to <i>When Animals Attack</i>.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.550
And then they'll fly us out to Hollywood,
'cause it's going to win.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.801
Luanne, please!

11:58.884 --> 12:01.178
No one is going to see that tape.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.265
Now, Mr. Hill,
let's move on past the blame game.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.975
I don't care who led who on.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.810
Now, if you'll sign our waiver form...

12:07.893 --> 12:08.728
Uncle Hank.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.188
-Your family's brunch is free.
-HANK: Mm-hm.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.149
That handsome bathrobe is yours

12:13.232 --> 12:15.568
-along with a beautiful gift basket.
-Mm-hm.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.987
And we'll throw in 25 La Grunta dollars.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.196
Fine.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.031
DIRECTOR: We'll go get the form.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.201
Luanne, you and I have a secret

12:24.285 --> 12:26.662
that we must take to our graves.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.750
Are you threatening to kill me,
Uncle Hank?

12:32.460 --> 12:33.836
Of course not.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.005
PEGGY: They're right,
La Grunta is the greatest.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.923
They even have extra-wide slippers

12:38.007 --> 12:39.216
for the full-footed woman.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.718
Oh, Luanne, honey,

12:40.801 --> 12:42.636
how could you afford all these things?

12:42.720 --> 12:46.182
Um... How could I afford not to?

12:46.265 --> 12:47.266
(chuckles)

12:47.349 --> 12:48.934
No, Luanne. What I really meant was...

12:49.018 --> 12:51.687
I don't know how she could be
so dang generous, either.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.481
You didn't steal them, did you?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.316
(chuckles)

12:55.399 --> 12:56.400
You didn't.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.696
Honey, did you try the capers
with your fruit pies yet?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.115
That was a real disappointment.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.034
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.790
We're doing great.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.541
They don't suspect a thing.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.794
You see that? It's like it never happened.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.963
But, uh... Luanne,
you can't mention it to me, even

13:18.047 --> 13:19.965
or it's like it did happen, you see?

13:20.049 --> 13:20.883
Gotcha.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.223
Ooh! "La Grunta Microbrewery."

13:27.306 --> 13:28.724
(sighs)
Shut up, Dale.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.518
You can't say "shut up."

13:30.601 --> 13:32.978
I haven't made fun of you
for going to the hotel yet.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.356
How long are you going to beat this
into the ground?

13:35.439 --> 13:36.982
The hotel is history.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.567
I thought I could have a morning

13:38.651 --> 13:40.361
without hearing about the dolphin,

13:40.444 --> 13:41.403
but I guess not.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.489
So what's your damn dolphin joke?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.783
Now you've ruined it.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.992
Good.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.577
(exclaims)
Hank's got one!

13:48.661 --> 13:50.746
(upbeat music)

13:51.413 --> 13:53.541
I get hooksies!
(chuckles)

13:53.624 --> 13:54.875
Ah!

13:55.459 --> 13:56.627
(screams)

13:56.710 --> 13:57.837
HANK: Ah! Get it off.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.046
(screams)

13:59.129 --> 14:00.714
(gasping)

14:01.715 --> 14:03.551
It was an ugly fish.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.219
I got a little scared, too.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.763
PEGGY: 98.8 degrees.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.974
Well, you can have it your way, Mr. Egg.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.935
We can wait just as long as you.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.689
You're not dealing with a couple
of hormone-crazed teenagers here.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.190
Come on!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.650
(knocks on door)

14:20.317 --> 14:21.735
Okay. We're decent.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.737
Turndown service.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.739
Here's your hotel mints.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.660
PEGGY: Bingo!

14:29.743 --> 14:30.995
It's time!

14:35.040 --> 14:36.250
Oh, yeah!

14:37.543 --> 14:40.921
(bedsprings squeaking like dolphin)

14:41.005 --> 14:42.673
(screaming)

14:42.756 --> 14:44.258
Hank, what's wrong with you?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.135
(knocks on door)

14:46.218 --> 14:48.971
Are you guys gonna eat those mints?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.392
-It was a good day for it, too.
-(men laughing)

14:53.475 --> 14:54.727
Hey, all right! Drink girl! Hey!

14:54.810 --> 14:57.313
Hey! The drink girl gets to take
my putt for me.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.481
Oh, I don't know how.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.733
MAN: It's easy. Here, I'll show you.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.568
Now, you relax the grip.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.278
Keep your arms straight, huh?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.446
Shoulders back.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.699
Now, flex those knees and bend your waist.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.951
MEN (laughing)

15:11.744 --> 15:14.747
Hey, you have good form.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.165
Sorry. I got to go.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.750
Whoa! Wait! The lesson's not over yet.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.293
I mean, we didn't pay for our drinks.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.003
-That's okay.
-(cart zooms)

15:24.590 --> 15:25.841
BOBBY: Coming through.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.800
Don't touch me!

15:26.884 --> 15:28.052
I'm sorry.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.970
That's okay.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.639
You didn't do anything.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.349
Is something wrong?

15:33.432 --> 15:36.018
Oh, I shouldn't tell anyone.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.811
Well, you didn't tell me.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.521
I figured it out.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.731
I guess.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.944
Bobby, some of the men on the golf course

15:45.027 --> 15:46.570
got fresh with me.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.907
Hmm. Did they use any swear words?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.785
No. It was more physical.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.869
HANK: Did you report them?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.246
Well, no.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.706
Then everyone would know.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.501
Besides, I shouldn't have taken
the putt in the first place.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.710
That was unprofessional.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.045
Luanne, that's crazy.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.297
Well, you didn't tell anyone
when you were...

16:05.381 --> 16:07.174
Luanne, please?

16:07.257 --> 16:09.969
You see, it's better to just put
these things behind you.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.346
If you can make it work, so can I.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.557
-Now, wait a minute. I didn't mean...
-Sorry. Can't talk about it.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.352
Now I'm not so sure

16:18.435 --> 16:20.646
I want to be a golf course drink girl.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.398
(somber music)

16:25.567 --> 16:28.070
Dad, we're down to two jars of capers.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.571
Well, we can't get any more.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.948
What does that mean?

16:31.031 --> 16:32.408
How hard can it be?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.201
You don't want to know.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.411
What are you doing, Luanne?

16:35.494 --> 16:38.247
Looking pretty in public
is just asking for trouble,

16:38.330 --> 16:40.874
so I borrowed some of your clothes.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.586
Okay, I'm just saying

16:44.670 --> 16:47.589
those two jars aren't going to get me
through the weekend.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.507
No!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.554
All right, Hank, I'm nobody's fool.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.931
So what exactly is going on?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.687
(sighs)
It was the dolphin.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.939
He, uh... attacked me.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.315
Hmm. I see.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.067
No, it was more than that.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.654
He... Uh, remember the movie on Lifetime,

17:10.738 --> 17:13.824
you know, what Gregory Harrison
did to Valerie Bertinelli?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.659
Oh, my God!

17:15.743 --> 17:17.202
Oh, I have never...

17:17.286 --> 17:19.371
Well, actually I have had
a dog hump my leg.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.998
Oh, it doesn't feel good, does it?

17:21.081 --> 17:23.959
No. I thought ignoring it
would make it better,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.920
but it just made it worse for everyone.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.963
You know, I've never

17:28.047 --> 17:29.757
said this about anything before,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.259
but it feels good to talk about it.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.385
That's good, Hank.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.762
Come on, just let it all out.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.138
It is so horrible.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.141
I mean, that creature swimming at you
with that hungry look

17:39.224 --> 17:42.019
waving his... I mean,
does he even have a...

17:42.102 --> 17:43.228
It's a mammal, Peggy.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.147
Oh, well, then of course he would.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.065
I'm sorry.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.776
He is a mammal,
and would have mammalian organs,

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
roughly in proportion to body size,
I'm guessing?

17:51.111 --> 17:53.781
Uh. That's enough
talking about it for now.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.491
Whatever feels best.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.701
This is all so disorienting.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.869
It's hard not to...

17:58.952 --> 18:00.329
I mean, did he know where to go?

18:00.412 --> 18:01.663
Peggy!

18:01.747 --> 18:03.082
I don't know what I'm going to do,

18:03.165 --> 18:05.918
but it starts with not lying
about what happened.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.504
It's the dolphin who ought
to be ashamed of himself.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.007
(all laughing)

18:17.596 --> 18:20.933
(crying)

18:21.016 --> 18:22.768
It happened to me!

18:22.851 --> 18:27.523
The same thing happened to me
six years ago.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.525
And four years ago.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.442
ALL: What?

18:30.526 --> 18:31.401
Oh, yeah.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.905
I saved up the 150,
and I was going to live it up.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.866
I was going to live it up
like the big boys

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
swimming with the dolphins.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.746
It was going to turn my life around,

18:42.830 --> 18:45.457
give me my confidence back...

18:46.166 --> 18:47.209
and then...

18:47.292 --> 18:48.877
Well, what did you do about it?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.464
Those hotel guys bought me off

18:52.548 --> 18:57.219
with this t-shirt.
It made me feel cheap and used

18:57.302 --> 18:59.221
but it... it breathes nice.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.473
All right, well,
there's one thing I can do.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.975
Quit drinking that hotel beer.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.393
I'm going to take it back.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.311
(grunting)

19:06.395 --> 19:07.437
BOBBY: Hey!

19:09.773 --> 19:10.816
Good for you, Hank Hill.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.861
You throw those 30 pieces of silver
right back at them.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.113
The slippers, too, Peggy.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.283
Oh, a pair of slippers isn't going to
give you your dignity back.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.909
You were humped by a dolphin.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.119
Come on, Peggy.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.539
(upbeat music)

19:26.957 --> 19:29.459
(dolphin chattering)

19:29.543 --> 19:31.670
Yes, that's so true.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.213
You're so wise.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.423
There! Take it all back!

19:34.506 --> 19:35.924
I don't want your payoff!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.176
What do you want?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.760
Money? Publicity?

19:38.844 --> 19:40.012
I want to see to it

19:40.095 --> 19:42.806
that no one has to go through
what i went through

19:42.890 --> 19:44.808
except for a female dolphin.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.185
You signed the agreement.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.561
Our lawyers will do what it takes

19:47.644 --> 19:49.229
to protect the good name of La Grunta.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.318
Why must you speak through guys like him?

19:54.401 --> 19:55.986
Why is it never me?

19:56.069 --> 19:57.237
(dolphin chattering)

20:00.073 --> 20:01.074
MAN: Here you go, darlin'.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.868
(men laughing)

20:04.036 --> 20:06.914
(dolphin chattering)

20:06.997 --> 20:08.999
(upbeat music)

20:11.418 --> 20:12.711
Hey! Hey, what's this?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.129
Who are you, the parking guy?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.964
Okay, I'm not handicapped.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.593
LUANNE: Go ahead! Run!

20:19.676 --> 20:21.929
Because I'm through running away from you!

20:22.012 --> 20:24.681
From now on,
I'm going to dress any way I want

20:24.765 --> 20:26.516
and you're just going to have
to deal with it!

20:26.600 --> 20:29.728
(applause)

20:30.562 --> 20:33.941
HANK: You think you can touch anyone
you want anywhere you want?

20:34.024 --> 20:36.068
Think it's okay
because no one says it's not?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.240
Okay, you threw me in the pool.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.783
Good job! I don't care!

20:42.866 --> 20:45.118
I was going for a swim anyway.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.329
(dolphin squeaking)

20:47.412 --> 20:49.831
MAN: You know, people pay
a lot of money to swim in here!

20:49.915 --> 20:50.749
(laughs)

20:50.832 --> 20:52.876
So you gave it to me for free.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.544
Thanks, pal.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.754
Hey, I owe you one!

20:55.837 --> 20:57.214
Maybe I'll buy you a beer!

20:57.297 --> 20:59.883
Hey, hey, what are you... What... Hey!

20:59.967 --> 21:02.344
-Hey-hey-hey-hey! Hey!
-(dolphin chattering)

21:02.427 --> 21:04.012
(man screams)

21:04.096 --> 21:05.097
(shutter clicks)

21:05.180 --> 21:07.349
(dolphin chattering)

21:07.432 --> 21:08.767
(dolphin squealing)

21:10.644 --> 21:12.354
TRAINER: <i>Let's all wish Duke good luck</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:15.482
<i>as he begins his return to the ocean.</i>

21:15.565 --> 21:16.984
(voice breaking)
Good-bye, Duke.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.151
Good-bye.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.195
-ALL: Bye, Duke.
-So long, little buddy.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.447
Good-bye, Duke.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.949
I love you!

21:24.574 --> 21:27.369
Mom, can I have a T-shirt?

21:29.621 --> 21:31.498
Thank you, Uncle Hank.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.791
You're welcome, Luanne.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.545
Can I send in the video
to <i>When Animals Attack</i> now?

21:36.628 --> 21:37.879
I don't think so.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.464
LUANNE: We could split the money.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.216
HANK: That's not necessary.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.759
LUANNE: I can have it all?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.386
HANK: Luanne, give me the tape.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.222
LUANNE: I already sent it in.
I thought you'd say yes.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.307
(Hank sighs)

21:54.688 --> 21:56.690
(fast-paced light music)

22:25.093 --> 22:26.595
HANK: <i>I never get brunch.</i>
