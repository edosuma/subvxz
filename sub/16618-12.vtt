I coproduced with Lil Wayne.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.825
Aw, he eats
the same way I do,

09:20.827 --> 09:22.527
without swallowing.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.764
You've flown south for
the winter with my heart.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.898
(honks)
Ow!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.901
I hope this bite
never heals.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.703
When I wrote an advice book,
I never dreamed

09:31.705 --> 09:33.238
it would help anyone.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.441
Everything I am
I owe to you.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.010
And a little bit

Well, then good news, Monty.

HOMER:<i> And so was forged the</i>

10:32.165 --> 10:33.498
Market greens?

Bone broth brittle?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.601
I don't know
what this place hates more,

10:36.603 --> 10:37.936
kids or ice cream.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.338
Really, man, a 3 Series?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.640
I mean, what is he?

10:41.642 --> 10:42.974
A sophomore at Exeter?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.243
Yeah, one cup of salted caramel.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.146
Woo-woo-woo,
scoop with the stripe, stupid.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.447
(chuckling):
I mean...

10:49.449 --> 10:51.116
That kid just cut in line.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.917
Are you gonna
let him do that?

10:52.919 --> 10:54.753
That's Blake Black.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.321
His dad runs
BlackLake Investments.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.622
So?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.591
Richest dad rules?

10:59.593 --> 11:00.825
Everyone knows that.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.527
Well, I don't.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.628
Don't misunderstand me,

11:03.630 --> 11:06.431
Mats Wilander may
have been a decent player,

11:06.433 --> 11:09.801
but until his inglés gets
just a little bit better,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.336
he can coach
somebody else.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.437
Pardon me a second.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.439
What is it,
head points, what?

11:14.441 --> 11:16.207
Just because your
father has money

11:16.209 --> 11:18.043
doesn't mean
you can cut.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.679
Hmm, it kind of
looks like it does.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.846
All right,
I'll tell you what:

11:21.848 --> 11:23.281
because I am
a nice guy,

11:23.283 --> 11:26.017
I am going to pay
for everyone's cones.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.620
Is that okay?
Does that make it okay?

11:28.622 --> 11:29.854
Yeah!
Yes!

11:29.856 --> 11:30.889
No!

11:30.891 --> 11:32.624
I would never accept ice cream

11:32.626 --> 11:35.794
from someone whose manners
are in the bottom one percent!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.128
(gasping)

11:37.130 --> 11:38.563
Boom.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.999
So, hey, hi.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.500
Are you going to the Allens'

11:42.502 --> 11:43.868
hot-dog-and-horseshoes
thing later?

11:43.870 --> 11:44.869
No.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.971
The Forstmans'
firefly thing?

11:46.973 --> 11:47.972
No.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.841
The Olins'
jellyfish fry thing?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.410
I'm not going to
any things at all!

11:52.412 --> 11:55.847
But I want to,
um, hang out.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.382
What? Why?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.417
I've never met anyone
like you before.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.820
Anyone with, you know,
I don't know, um,

12:01.822 --> 12:03.054
morals.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.489
Oh.
(giggles)

12:04.491 --> 12:06.691
Well, I guess it is
a little judgy of me

12:06.693 --> 12:09.594
to be completely
disgusted by you.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.896
Great, I'll set something up.
Erin, are you on?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.866
Okay, I need to bail on
the Kravises' freeze tag thing.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.701
No, I know,
I have to.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.570
Send the big basket.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.904
What's wrong, honey?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.606
Lisa's got
a rich boyfriend,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.942
Dad's hanging out
with a hip-hop super producer,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.543
and I'm stuck window-shopping

12:25.545 --> 12:28.346
with you two fun-sucking
stink buckets.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.581
It's not fair!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.382
Life's not fair, kid.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.584
Do I know you?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.853
If life was fair,
you would know me.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.522
But know this:
Jay G ain't all that.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.389
What do you mean?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.058
Buy a candle
and I'll tell you.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.559
What's your
cheapest one?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.094
$55.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.598
No way. I could start a fire
in the woods for nothing.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.601
HOMER:<i> So Bart met someone</i>
<i>who I think comes back later.</i>

12:49.603 --> 12:51.269
<i>I forget why.</i>

12:51.271 --> 12:54.372
Hmm. Who would have thought
two billionaire Republicans

12:54.374 --> 12:56.941
from such different backgrounds
could end up as chums?

12:56.943 --> 13:00.145
Is not green a more powerful
color than black or white?

13:00.147 --> 13:03.148
The Lord picks a select few
to accumulate more money

13:03.150 --> 13:04.582
than anyone else.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.885
You and I bear that
sacred avarice.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.954
Each of my enterprises
has its own G6.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.589
What's that one?

13:11.591 --> 13:13.792
That's for my...
(chuckles)

13:13.794 --> 13:15.660
personal horticulturalist.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.428
(chuckling):
You know what I'm sayin'?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.863
I don't.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.742
You seem to
get so much joy

13:30.744 --> 13:32.811
out of your money.
I envy you.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.146
You've given me so much, Monty.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.917
Let me give you something back:
the freedom to live large.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.787
A charge plate?

13:42.789 --> 13:45.857
I've never had one of those
newfangled swipe-a-ma-jigs.

13:45.859 --> 13:49.027
It's an Obsidian Card,
the most exclusive.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.863
No spending limit,
no store has ever heard of it.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.832
But they have to accept it.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.367
Take it
if you want to roll like G.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.771
Don't forget
to sign it.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.972
Oh, right.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.842
No, no, not a felt-tip.
Oh! It'll smudge.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.643
Okay, quick, blow on
it to dry the ink.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.880
(both blowing)

14:12.052 --> 14:15.053
Blake, I have to say,
this whale watch

14:15.055 --> 14:17.956
was a very
thoughtful idea.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.559
(gasps)
Oh, it's a whole family.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.228
But they're so far away.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.130
Far? Babe, when you
whale watch with me,

14:26.132 --> 14:27.699
you sit pod-side.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.201
Fellas!
What can we do here?

14:31.171 --> 14:34.973
This way, the whales know
we are VIPs.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.708
Um, where's the baby?

14:36.710 --> 14:37.809
There's supposed
to be a baby.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.544
I paid for a calf.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.713
Does that mean anything?

14:41.715 --> 14:45.049
Whale-copters?
VIP pod-view?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.718
This is awful!

14:46.720 --> 14:49.420
Well, if we went
on some lame econo-watch,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.522
we might not see
blowhole one.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.857
I mean,
what are you saying?

14:52.859 --> 14:54.058
Are you hearing
yourself?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.661
Blake, I really believed
you could change.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.497
And you did, you became
even more horrible.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.600
(singing)

15:02.602 --> 15:04.569
(grunts)

15:04.571 --> 15:06.905
These aren't VIP emotions.

15:06.907 --> 15:07.939
This is worse than the time

15:07.941 --> 15:10.541
I had to eat
grocery store sushi.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.378
The shiso leaf was plastic!

15:13.380 --> 15:14.879
(crying):
It was plastic!

15:14.881 --> 15:17.515
JAY:
<i>You got to buy it,</i>
<i>M.B., it's fate.</i>

15:20.220 --> 15:22.353
Oh, I don't know.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.123
$100,000 feels like
a lot of money.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.791
You've got to
splash the cash,

15:26.793 --> 15:28.927
fling the bling,
spill them bills.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.629
It don't matter, just
splatter the batter.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.898
Splash the cash.

$10 million!

16:28.822 --> 16:29.821
(crowd gasps)

16:29.823 --> 16:31.239
Sold!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.656
I just spent more
money than I know

16:32.659 --> 16:34.258
on something I
don't even want.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.594
And it's the greatest
feeling I've ever had!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.831
(grunts weakly)

16:39.833 --> 16:41.232
Still better than Shaq.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.106
HOMER:<i> Mr. Burns was living</i>
<i>the high life,</i>

16:48.108 --> 16:51.509
<i>splurging on every luxury,</i>
<i>even the ultimate indulgence--</i>

16:51.511 --> 16:54.679
<i>useless hangers-on like me.</i>

16:57.050 --> 16:58.449
Noice.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.719
To think, all the years
I wasted without a posse.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.454
Good-bye, loneliness.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.789
We get all this stuff

17:04.791 --> 17:06.858
just for letting Mr. Burns
beat us in mini golf.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.326
(chuckling):
What a deal!

17:08.328 --> 17:10.795
My whole job is to not
make eye contact with him.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.900
I thought I'd get tired
of window-shopping

17:15.902 --> 17:19.070
in this fancy little town,
but it ain't happening.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.373
A chessboard
where the pieces are lipsticks!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.374
(gasps)

17:23.376 --> 17:24.442
(groans)

17:26.379 --> 17:28.613
(gasps)
A horse show!

17:29.582 --> 17:32.316
(gasps)
A protest!

17:32.318 --> 17:33.885
Huh?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.387
Blake, is that you?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.889
What happened to
your privilege?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.090
I checked it.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.091
(gasps)

17:40.093 --> 17:41.692
Lisa, when you rejected me,

17:41.694 --> 17:44.395
I knew I had to do
whatever it took

17:44.397 --> 17:45.730
to become
worthy of you.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.000
This now runs
on solar power and falafel.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.102
Now, that's sustainable!

17:51.104 --> 17:53.404
I've dedicated
my entire allowance

17:53.406 --> 17:55.740
to Trustafarians
for Horse Justice.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.009
Here's an upside down bucket
for you to drum on.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.011
Well, what girl
could say no

18:00.013 --> 18:02.747
to a socially
conscious drum circle?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.015
Yo, lamp dress,

18:04.017 --> 18:07.185

Mr. Burns, your bill came
from the Obsidian Card.

Are you sure you're not

to get back at Jay G.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.711
Fill his office
with balloons?
Too soft.

28:00.713 --> 28:01.679
Fill his office
with scorpions?

28:01.681 --> 28:02.946
Eh, I'm having a fight

28:02.948 --> 28:04.181
with my scorpion guy.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.116
Oh, oh, oh. Banana
in his tailpipe.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.618
I can't afford a banana!

28:07.620 --> 28:08.852
(twig snaps)

28:08.854 --> 28:11.221
What's that? A spy! Grab him.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.656
Come here, spy.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.024
What are you doing here, boy?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.126
You're not dead. Are you?

28:16.128 --> 28:18.829
I followed you. I got suspicious
when you came home last night

28:18.831 --> 28:20.397
covered in grave dirt.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.399
Be gone, urchin.
We have work to do.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.834
Wait, wait! He can help.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.837
No one's better
at nasty schemes than this kid.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.872
I mean, he's messed up.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.409
Look at him. You got to figure
his family life's a disaster.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.344
Why should I help Burns
now that he's broke?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.313
I've got more money
than he does.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.382
Would the cape and gloves

28:38.384 --> 28:40.684
of the infamous
Gaslight Strangler

28:40.686 --> 28:43.420
change your mind?

28:43.422 --> 28:45.856
If you want to take down
a rapper, you got to destroy

28:45.858 --> 28:49.326
the thing that's most important
to him: his rep.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.863
(whispering):
Rep means reputation.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.332
To do that, we got to go
to the ultimate expert

28:55.334 --> 28:57.267
on urban culture.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.902
<i>A white nerd.</i>

28:58.904 --> 29:01.271
So, in South Central
Springfield in the '90s,

29:01.273 --> 29:03.240
there were four major
hip-hop sub-scenes.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.876
The Good Time Mafia,
Licorice Avenue,

29:05.878 --> 29:08.679
The Dirty, Dirty North,
and The FLTA.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.414
The Fine Ladies Thug Army.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.282
Fascinating.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.052
Yes, yes.
But do you have anything

29:15.054 --> 29:17.955
we can use
against my sworn enemy, Jay G?

29:17.957 --> 29:20.891
Before he was Jay G,
he was Jeremy Gilroy,

29:20.893 --> 29:23.293
a founding member
of The Five Boyfriends,

29:23.295 --> 29:24.928
a soulful R&B quintet.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.730
Hey, I know this guy.

29:26.732 --> 29:29.533
He tried to sell me
a $55 candle!

29:29.535 --> 29:32.202
That's Jazzy James,
the Lyrical Miracle.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.271
He wrote all of
Jay's early hits.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.706
But they had a falling out,

29:35.708 --> 29:38.108
and he was never
heard from again.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.277
Then only one man
can write the rap

29:40.279 --> 29:43.313
that will ruin the rep of Jay G.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.915
Jazzy James.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.117
HOMER:<i> I told you this guy</i>
<i>would come back.</i>

29:47.119 --> 29:48.485
<i>Told you.</i>

29:48.487 --> 29:51.221
Yeah, I used to be
Jazzy James.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.990
The Lyrical Miracle?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.925
My skills were empirical.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.829
I wrote all the rhymes for
Jay G's first hip-hop record.

29:58.831 --> 30:02.499
I didn't get a dime, because
I signed over all the rights.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.734
Why'd you do that?

30:03.736 --> 30:04.735
(groans)

30:04.737 --> 30:05.736
All right, all right.

30:05.738 --> 30:07.037
I'll sign!

30:09.341 --> 30:11.775
He took my money,
stole my girl,

30:11.777 --> 30:15.779
made me get a tattoo of
the baseball from<i> Major League.</i>

30:15.781 --> 30:17.514
It broke me. I fell hard,

30:17.516 --> 30:18.916
into scented candles.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.684
(inhales deeply)

30:20.686 --> 30:22.686
(exhales)
Quince.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.755
Listen, Jazzy.
We're gonna tear down Jay G

30:24.757 --> 30:26.690
with the ultimate revenge rap.

30:26.692 --> 30:27.925
And you're gonna write it.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.760
Oh...
(grunts)

30:29.762 --> 30:30.761
(glass shatters)

30:30.763 --> 30:31.995
I'm in.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.497
Excellent.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.199
What is... rap?

30:35.201 --> 30:36.200
Hmm?

30:36.202 --> 30:37.634
Hmm.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.436
Quick, boy! Hide this thing.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.871
(Bart grunting)

30:42.708 --> 30:46.610
Homie, it's so sweet of you
to come visit me at my store.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.613
But aren't you gonna get in
trouble for missing work?

30:49.615 --> 30:52.282
You let me worry
about the nuclear plant.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.884
The important thing
for you to do

30:53.886 --> 30:56.486
is believe I still work there.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.723
I can't wait to show you
the changes I've made.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.292
We're getting
a lot of foot traffic.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.795
Three people used
the bathroom yesterday.

31:04.797 --> 31:06.797
How much should I charge
for these handbags

31:06.799 --> 31:09.499
made from the speaker covers
of old jukeboxes?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.501
Five dollars.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.971
A hundred dollars!
(gasps)

31:13.973 --> 31:16.540
It's happening.
It's happening.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.209
I love my store!

31:19.211 --> 31:22.512
We're putting up new wallpaper.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.848
(grunting)

31:24.850 --> 31:27.017
Is Mom gonna be okay?

31:27.019 --> 31:30.053
I don't know, son,
I don't know.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.822
MAN:
Oh, it's not her, fellas.

31:31.824 --> 31:34.258
It's the curse of the
adorable little store.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.693
Didn't always used to
be like this. No, no.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.162
Once, this land was
full of actual stores,

31:39.164 --> 31:41.031
as far as the eye could see.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.067
Then the rich people came.
They didn't need to make money,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.837
they just needed a place for
their friends to wander into,

31:46.839 --> 31:48.872
after spin class.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.440
Yeah, that's progress for you.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.242
I suppose.

31:52.244 --> 31:55.245
HOMER:<i> And so,</i>
<i>with Jazzy James on board,</i>

31:55.247 --> 31:58.448

a corking revenge rap.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.348
If anyone's hungry,
we've set up a deli platter

Oh. Ain't no deli platter

33:14.259 --> 33:16.927

hear about. Mm-mm.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.762
Praline?
She's Jay G's ex-wife.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.263
I thought
you were in prison.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.032
That's what the guards said,

33:22.034 --> 33:23.734

33:27.272 --> 33:28.538
(chuckles)
I see.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.539
Oh, no,
he didn't.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.674
No, he
did not.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.142
Shut up, Miata.
Oh.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.012
Mm-hmm, that one.

33:35.014 --> 33:38.682
So, Praline, are you with us
or against us?

33:38.684 --> 33:41.118

the Rhyme Crime All-Stars.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.754

35:28.460 --> 35:32.229
Sorry to crash your party
as a hologram, M.B.,

35:32.231 --> 35:34.664

a little celebration of my own.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.299
I just bought
the master recording

35:36.301 --> 35:38.768

Jazzy James

All-Stars hate you!

35:43.275 --> 35:44.774
They'd never sell out.

35:44.776 --> 35:45.942
They would...

35:45.944 --> 35:48.111
for money!

35:48.113 --> 35:49.346
Sorry, Monty.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.181
Jay G is the best producer
in the world

35:51.183 --> 35:54.618
and you're a tone-deaf pauper
who lives in a grave.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.619
Ouch.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.988
I thought I hated him,
but now I don't.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.789
So now I'm here.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.925

a strong female hologram,

spiritual journey.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.836
Lesson one:
protect your neck.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.772
Say good-bye
to your revenge rap forever.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.374
'Cause it's
about to drop.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.342
(gulps, honks)

36:19.344 --> 36:21.044
Mmm.
(kisses)

36:21.046 --> 36:23.013
Party at the power plant, y'all.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.984
I swear on the squid beak
of Lord Cthulhu

36:27.986 --> 36:29.786
and all his briny shoggoths,

36:29.788 --> 36:32.289
I will get revenge on you,
Jay G.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.357
HOMER:
<i>And so Mr. Burns beat on,</i>

36:34.359 --> 36:36.459
<i>fists against the hologram,</i>

36:36.461 --> 36:39.863
<i>punching back ceaselessly</i>
<i>into his own face.</i>

36:45.304 --> 36:47.370
Which new name
do you like better?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.805
Next Doorables...

36:48.807 --> 36:51.374
(gasps)
or the Lavender Zeppelin?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.210
I just don't
know anymore.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.244
(door opens, bell rings)

36:54.246 --> 36:55.745
(gasps)
A customer!

36:55.747 --> 36:57.480
Oh, it's you.

36:57.482 --> 36:58.748
Baby, I'm sorry.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.684
I stayed loyal to Mr. Burns,

37:00.686 --> 37:02.752
coproduced a failed revenge rap,

37:02.754 --> 37:04.221
and now we've got nothing.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.555
(gasps)

37:05.557 --> 37:08.158
I know it's crazy,
but he needed me.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.993
Oh, it's okay, Homie.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.595
You're not mad?

37:11.597 --> 37:14.497
Your heart told you to
stick with Mr. Burns,

37:14.499 --> 37:16.499
and the thing I
love about you most

37:16.501 --> 37:19.736
is you've got a heart
as big as The Ritz.

37:19.738 --> 37:23.240
Wow, Mom, you just made an
F. Scott Fitzgerald reference.

37:23.242 --> 37:26.710
Lisa, please,
I did graduate high school.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.945
(sighs)

37:34.853 --> 37:39.723
I've just hatched a plan
for the most delicious revenge.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.458
Simpson,
we must away.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.859
Did you want to buy that?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.527
Just looking.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.529
We can't afford the store
anymore!

37:46.531 --> 37:47.897
Oh, thank God.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.766
Ha! I'm free!

37:49.768 --> 37:50.967
(grunts)

37:51.937 --> 37:54.571
Well, before long,
another aimless soul

37:54.573 --> 37:56.873
will open another
adorable store here.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.277
And when they do,
Old Sam the Sign Hanger

38:00.279 --> 38:03.446
will be ready,
with his level and his ladder.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.715
Oh, why,
here comes one now.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.817
Oh, honey, isn't it darling?

38:07.819 --> 38:08.818
Huh?
(laughs)

38:08.820 --> 38:10.887
We finally found
the Bookmark Barn.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.456
(cackling)
Oh, this<i> is</i> Wicker Works.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.725
We're gonna sell
so many Yorkie sweaters.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.628
We can use the contractor
that did Karen's store.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.997
HOMER:
<i>Mr. Burns' plan was</i>
<i>so horrifying,</i>

38:20.999 --> 38:23.967
<i>I could barely shut up</i>
<i>and go along with it.</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:25.969
<i>But I was the only friend</i>
<i>he had left in the world</i>

38:25.971 --> 38:27.971
<i>and he was whipping me so hard.</i>

38:27.973 --> 38:30.407
Ow, ow!

38:30.409 --> 38:32.776
Oh, Goosius.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.445
Daddy's got your oatmeal.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.882
Golden raisins,
just the way you like 'em, baby.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.823
Goosey!

38:46.825 --> 38:48.758
(tires screech)

38:48.760 --> 38:51.127
Where's my goose?

38:51.129 --> 38:53.363
Why, he's right here.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.333
Fancy a bite of roast Goosius?

38:59.805 --> 39:01.171
You didn't!

39:01.173 --> 39:03.273
(laughing):
Oh, I did.

39:03.275 --> 39:05.942
Mmm. A trifle fatty,
but other than that,

39:05.944 --> 39:07.510
excellent.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.380
Damn, I didn't think
you had it in you, M.B.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.716
(sobbing):
Oh, man.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.384
I don't want to
live in a world

39:14.386 --> 39:17.854
without the mascot
of my multinational empire.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.289
(sobs)

39:19.291 --> 39:21.691
(Goosius honking,
Homer grunting)

39:21.693 --> 39:23.026
Stop it!

39:23.028 --> 39:25.028
I saved your life,
you stupid duck!

39:25.030 --> 39:28.398
Simpson, I told you
to cook his goose.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.666
I couldn't do it.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.967
We just had our
portrait done.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.836
(honks)

39:32.838 --> 39:34.704
Then, what did I eat?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.740
Roast goose from
the gas station.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.842
Fine, then I'll
kill it myself.
(gasps)

39:50.589 --> 39:52.489

39:53.325 --> 39:56.426
Damn it, Monty,
I don't want to die.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.061
Well, if we have
to end this way,

39:58.063 --> 39:59.996
at least it's
of natural causes.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.432
A business deal
gone wrong.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.701
(creaking)

40:04.703 --> 40:05.702
(shouts)

40:05.704 --> 40:06.836
Tell me, Jay.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.071
Why'd you betray me?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.706
We were kindred souls.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.074
Brothers in avarice.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.077
Why? Because
you told me to!

40:14.079 --> 40:16.112
In your own last chapter.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.718
"You will never be
truly ruthless

40:21.720 --> 40:23.853
until you destroy the one
who made you."

40:23.855 --> 40:25.922
I had to tear
you down, M.B.!

40:25.924 --> 40:28.625
It was the final rung.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.827
(creaking)

40:32.431 --> 40:34.431
I just wanted
to be ruthless,

40:34.433 --> 40:35.865
like you.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.907
That I inspired you to such pure
and evil greed,

40:43.909 --> 40:45.775
that is my greatest triumph.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.877
I am truly immortal.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.546
We're about to die, fool.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.784
(yelling)

40:58.824 --> 41:02.225
Smithers, I ordered ice,
not slush.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.827
Sorry I'm late, sir.

41:03.829 --> 41:04.994
A few of these
French Canadian bikers

41:04.996 --> 41:06.429

at the border.

41:06.431 --> 41:08.832
Apparently,
I'm their leader now.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.901
Smithers, Smithers, Smithers!

41:11.903 --> 41:14.170
(chuckles)

41:14.172 --> 41:15.839
Ow. That stings.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.607
Oh, that one's nice.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.175
How dare you.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.610
Fascinating.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.778

Excellent.

really over.

41:34.526 --> 41:38.595

I'm gonna miss Goosius.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.597
Aah!

41:40.599 --> 41:42.131
Thanks, boy.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.634
Do you think Mr. Burns
learned anything from all this?

41:44.636 --> 41:46.636
Could it have changed him
for the better?

41:46.638 --> 41:47.937
You know what?

41:47.939 --> 41:50.073
<i>I have a feeling it did.</i>

For the sheer joy of it,
