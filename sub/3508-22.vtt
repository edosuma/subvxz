WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:02.399
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.426 --> 00:04.026
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.360 --> 00:06.086
Psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:06.324 --> 00:07.346
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.747 --> 00:08.347
Who am I?

00:08.436 --> 00:09.575
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.576 --> 00:09.976
Castle.

00:10.010 --> 00:10.670
Castle.

00:10.671 --> 00:12.671
I really am ruggedly
handsome, aren't I?

00:12.817 --> 00:15.007
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:15.217 --> 00:16.036
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:16.071 --> 00:17.091
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:17.126 --> 00:19.032
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:19.078 --> 00:20.564
And thanks to my
friendship with the mayor,

00:20.565 --> 00:21.565
I get to be on her case.

00:21.599 --> 00:23.542
I would be happy to
let you spank me.

00:23.577 --> 00:24.453
And together, we catch killers

00:25.401 --> 00:26.389
we make a pretty good team,
you know?

00:26.390 --> 00:27.390
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.524 --> 00:28.218
Turner and Hooch.

00:28.581 --> 00:30.084
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

00:30.783 --> 00:32.080
Ahh.

00:32.081 --> 00:33.908
You meet up with
that baby last night?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.870
Yeah. Yeah? No sleep again?

00:35.871 --> 00:38.598
Never. No sleep, baby.
That's how we do it.

00:46.025 --> 00:48.308
Chef? Chef?

00:49.089 --> 00:50.193
Check his pulse.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.384
Ah!

00:52.504 --> 00:54.222
Whoa.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.626
What broke? A stupid glass.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.673
Remind me to get smarter glasses.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.511
Somehow I feel that the glass
is not quite the problem.

01:01.512 --> 01:03.886
I got invited to the
Hamptons with Lacey's family

01:04.006 --> 01:06.343
and a couple of other friends.
Well, that sounds like fun.

01:07.612 --> 01:08.996
So why do you look like someone

01:09.116 --> 01:10.167
who just got voted off the island?

01:10.428 --> 01:11.729
A.P. tests are next week,

01:11.849 --> 01:13.595
so I really need to
study all weekend.

01:13.971 --> 01:15.518
But I really want to
go to the Hamptons.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.026
The eternal struggle
between work and play.

01:18.273 --> 01:19.675
The trick is, when you grow up,

01:20.241 --> 01:21.773
find work that feels like play.

01:22.579 --> 01:24.010
Speaking of work...

01:24.742 --> 01:26.366
What are you doing up
and dressed so early?

01:26.486 --> 01:28.565
Oh, no reason. Just thought I'd
get an early start to my day.

01:28.685 --> 01:30.444
Mm-hmm. Bye.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.588 --> 01:42.834
All right. So, um,
I'll see you tomorrow night?

01:42.954 --> 01:44.754
Yeah. Good. Okay. Okay.

01:45.342 --> 01:46.708
See ya.

01:47.456 --> 01:49.262
What's Demming doing
in our break room?

01:49.382 --> 01:50.666
Is there something wrong
with the coffee downstairs?

01:50.786 --> 01:52.069
Well, you're the one who bought us

01:52.189 --> 01:53.209
the Cappuccino machine, Castle.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.759
Yes, but I bought it for homicide

01:54.879 --> 01:56.729
not the entire precinct. Oh.

01:57.179 --> 01:58.412
What's tomorrow night? What?

01:59.907 --> 02:00.789
Oh, Tom was wondering

02:00.909 --> 02:02.654
if I wanted to get
together tomorrow night.

02:03.941 --> 02:05.076
Why? Is that a problem?

02:05.582 --> 02:06.690
Why would I have a
problem with that?

02:07.054 --> 02:08.094
Hmm.

02:08.214 --> 02:09.747
Excuse me.

02:09.747 --> 02:10.975
Beckett.

02:12.117 --> 02:13.949
Okay. Be right there.

02:15.317 --> 02:17.250
Tom.

02:19.334 --> 02:21.257
Right. Right. The murder is at Q3?

02:21.620 --> 02:23.066
This place has only
been open three months.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.252
<i>I</i> can't even get a
reservation here.

02:24.372 --> 02:25.785
I've been dying to eat here.

02:25.905 --> 02:27.186
Well, evidently,
you're not the only one.

02:27.575 --> 02:28.934
Where are we? In the kitchen.

02:29.339 --> 02:31.609
Victim's name is Balthazar Wolf.
He's the head chef here.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.856
Big bad Wolf? Winner of
"Kitchen Wars," season six?

02:34.976 --> 02:36.046
I know. Right?

02:36.166 --> 02:38.728
Aw, man. I never got to taste
his Foie gras sandwich.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.236
He was found this morning
by the pastry chef--

02:41.356 --> 02:43.318
Spike Ridenhauer-
and one of the dishwashers--

02:43.438 --> 02:44.472
Juan Costa.

02:46.184 --> 02:47.326
Oh.

02:47.327 --> 02:48.860
Castle, stop!

02:49.245 --> 02:51.707
D-do you not see the little
orange cones around the body?

02:51.982 --> 02:53.210
Is that actually his hand?

02:53.330 --> 02:55.621
That's the effect of L-N-2...

02:56.480 --> 02:57.434
Commonly known

02:57.554 --> 03:00.079
as liquid nitrogen,
a cryogenic refrigerant.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.795
It instantly freezes anything
it comes in touch with,

03:02.915 --> 03:05.398
including Mr. Wolf-
made him fragile as glass.

03:05.922 --> 03:08.984
This is both literally
and figuratively cool.

03:10.185 --> 03:12.440
Uh, Wolf was a follower
of molecular gastronomy.

03:12.686 --> 03:15.589
It's using the science
to manipulate the...

03:18.061 --> 03:19.075
And you don't care.

03:19.562 --> 03:22.164
It's usually pretty safe
unless someone dumps it on you.

03:22.477 --> 03:23.439
Time of death?

03:23.771 --> 03:27.077
Well, all our normal indicators...

03:27.197 --> 03:29.539
Are contaminated by the L-N-2.

03:29.858 --> 03:31.826
I'll see what I can do
once I get to the morgue.

03:31.946 --> 03:35.018
But, uh, we're gonna have
to let him thaw a bit

03:35.019 --> 03:36.079
before we can move him.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.777
Looks like there was a struggle.

03:38.153 --> 03:38.862
Robbery?

03:38.982 --> 03:41.556
No, no sign of forced entry,
nothing's missing.

03:41.557 --> 03:44.268
According to Mr.
Ridenhauer and Mr. Costa here,

03:44.629 --> 03:45.713
our victim stayed at the restaurant

03:45.833 --> 03:46.978
long after everyone else had left.

03:47.098 --> 03:48.077
And what time was that?

03:48.197 --> 03:49.101
It was around 11:00.

03:49.221 --> 03:50.821
One of our clients had
special ordered a cake,

03:50.941 --> 03:52.336
and Wolf stayed behind
to finish it up.

03:52.929 --> 03:53.993
Aren't you the pastry chef?

03:54.113 --> 03:56.205
Yeah, but I don't do crazy
stuff like Wolf does.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.078
I just, uh, I made the cushion,

03:58.198 --> 04:00.451
and he sculpted the crown, uh,
the heart and the jewels.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.683
That's probably why he had
the rotary evaporator out

04:02.803 --> 04:04.034
and the liquid nitrogen.

04:04.154 --> 04:05.725
All right, after Perlmutter
gets the body out,

04:05.845 --> 04:07.750
I'm gonna want C.S.U. to come in
and sweep for fibers and prints.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.461
Yeah, yeah.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.280
Yo, Beckett. The owner's here.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.754
Say there's been an
accident. Madison?

04:14.620 --> 04:16.742
Becks? What are you doing here?

04:17.103 --> 04:18.902
I'm a homicide Detective.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.223
Shut the front door. I know.

04:21.224 --> 04:23.180
I-I know, right?

04:23.455 --> 04:25.276
What a messed up way
for us to reconnect.

04:25.396 --> 04:27.071
Madison Queller,
this is Richard Castle.

04:27.191 --> 04:28.107
Hi.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.284
Hi. Please call me Rick.

04:29.404 --> 04:30.912
How do you two know each other?
High School.

04:31.032 --> 04:32.541
Ninth grade French.

04:33.018 --> 04:35.419
I can't believe the biggest
scofflaw at Stuy became a cop.

04:35.539 --> 04:37.049
Yeah.

04:38.386 --> 04:39.862
So I'm gonna need
contact information

04:39.863 --> 04:41.427
for all the restaurant staff.

04:41.547 --> 04:42.437
Come on, Becks.

04:42.557 --> 04:43.569
You think somebody here
might have done it?

04:43.689 --> 04:45.680
You know, no forced entry
usually means that the killer

04:45.800 --> 04:47.649
either knew the chef or
was someone who had keys.

04:47.769 --> 04:50.268
So I'm gonna need alibis
from everyone, including you.

04:50.571 --> 04:52.205
Sorry. No. No, I, uh...

04:52.206 --> 04:53.173
I understand.

04:53.621 --> 04:55.383
I was at a party
until the wee hours.

04:55.642 --> 04:56.684
Lots of people saw me.,

04:56.804 --> 04:58.157
Now did you know if
Wolf had any enemies

04:58.277 --> 04:59.672
anyone that wanted to do him harm?

04:59.976 --> 05:01.886
He was the bad boy
America loved to hate.

05:02.189 --> 05:03.714
I was a guest judge.
That's how we met.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.496
Seriously?

05:05.616 --> 05:07.124
You never heard of "Kitchen Wars"?

05:07.369 --> 05:08.599
Uh...

05:09.334 --> 05:12.677
No. I don't really get a
lot of time to watch tv.

05:12.797 --> 05:14.792
This from the girl
who'd spend hours

05:14.912 --> 05:16.762
watching "Saved By
the Bell" reruns?

05:17.268 --> 05:18.306
Really?

05:18.826 --> 05:20.595
What else did she
spend hours doing?

05:21.049 --> 05:22.379
Castle, real crime scene.

05:22.499 --> 05:24.464
Not mystery writer
research time, okay?

05:25.101 --> 05:27.355
Did you notice anything
unusual about Wolf lately?

05:27.703 --> 05:28.699
Anything at all.

05:28.819 --> 05:30.185
There was one thing.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.440
Wolf usually worked nonstop.

05:32.818 --> 05:34.522
You couldn't tear him
away from the kitchen.

05:34.977 --> 05:36.553
But for the last couple of weeks,

05:36.673 --> 05:38.512
he'd disappear around 3:00,

05:38.513 --> 05:40.581
and come back just in
time to prep at 5:00.

05:40.941 --> 05:41.799
Did he say where he was going?

05:41.919 --> 05:43.343
No. He said it was personal.

05:43.463 --> 05:45.165
Hey, guys. I found something.

05:46.457 --> 05:48.545
Juan the dishwasher was the
last one here last night,

05:48.665 --> 05:50.005
and he swears he finished
every single dish.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.467
Two dirty bowls,
two spoons and a soup pot?

05:52.901 --> 05:54.496
Looks like Wolf had
some late-night company.

05:55.416 --> 05:57.513
It's popcorn soup.
It's Domingo's specialty.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.939
Domingo? Our line chef. .

05:59.200 --> 06:00.615
He must have come back
after everybody left.

06:00.904 --> 06:02.948
That means he's the last one
to have seen Wolf alive.

06:03.068 --> 06:04.644
Do you have an address? Of course.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.318
All right, track
down Domingo and see

06:06.438 --> 06:08.000
why he was here so
late and what he saw.

06:08.862 --> 06:11.479
I'll also need the contact
info for Wolf's next of kin.

06:15.749 --> 06:16.949
High School friend, huh?

06:17.069 --> 06:18.843
I bet she knows where all
your bodies are buried.

06:19.121 --> 06:20.365
You can dig all you want, Castle.

06:20.485 --> 06:22.494
My secrets are safe with her.
How can you be sure?

06:22.614 --> 06:23.933
Because whatever
she knows about me,

06:24.295 --> 06:25.683
I know worse about her.

06:26.624 --> 06:28.601
We used to hang out,
big group of us,

06:28.721 --> 06:29.630
had a good time.

06:29.933 --> 06:32.068
And... what's a good time?

06:32.069 --> 06:33.643
Well, if you don't know by now,

06:33.763 --> 06:35.364
I'm sure it's too
late to show you one.

06:36.541 --> 06:37.973
Here's Wolf's emergency contact--

06:38.093 --> 06:39.127
David Nicolaides.

06:39.472 --> 06:41.479
Wolf didn't have any real family.

06:41.889 --> 06:44.332
He spent most of his childhood
in and out of foster homes,

06:44.452 --> 06:47.383
which is why we're listed as,
uh, next of kin.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.919
My girlfriend Cecily and I are
about as close as it gets.

06:51.599 --> 06:52.743
They were like brothers.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.517
How long did you know each other?

06:54.864 --> 06:55.819
Since our teens.

06:56.218 --> 06:58.028
My dad gave him a job in
our restaurant as a busboy,

06:58.148 --> 07:00.404
uh, when he got out of juvie.

07:01.011 --> 07:03.690
It didn't take long to tell that
he had a real gift for food.

07:03.978 --> 07:05.251
Been like family ever since.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.382
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?

07:07.967 --> 07:09.390
He had a bad-boy
image from the show,

07:09.510 --> 07:10.868
but he was actually sweet.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.886
Winning "Kitchen Wars" must
have been huge for him.

07:14.006 --> 07:14.902
How was he handling it?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.357
He loved it-- the fame,
the fortune.

07:17.477 --> 07:20.132
It was everything he ever
dreamed of, e-except...

07:20.407 --> 07:21.411
Except what?

07:21.531 --> 07:23.897
I-I think he might have had
some financial troubles.

07:24.241 --> 07:25.078
What do you mean?

07:25.395 --> 07:27.590
When my dad passed
away a few months back,

07:27.710 --> 07:29.558
he left his restaurant
to Wolf and me.

07:29.678 --> 07:31.309
It was nothing fancy like Q3.

07:31.612 --> 07:33.030
It was just a little
diner in Queens.

07:34.129 --> 07:35.436
But about two weeks ago,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.167
he came to me asking
if I would buy him out.

07:37.609 --> 07:39.769
I tried to talk him out of it.

07:39.889 --> 07:41.337
I even told him that I
would loan him the money,

07:41.457 --> 07:42.612
but he refused.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.841
And in the end, I gave in
and I bought out his share.

07:47.202 --> 07:49.627
For how much? $40,000.

07:49.987 --> 07:51.857
Didn't he just win a lot
of money on "Kitchen Wars"?

07:51.977 --> 07:53.879
Well, he put it all
into the new restaurant.

07:53.999 --> 07:55.955
I tried to tell him to
hold some of it back,

07:56.075 --> 07:58.720
but he was an
all-or-nothing kind of guy.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.316
<i>Jennifer, Wolf,</i>

08:03.436 --> 08:06.629
<i>we've scored your dishes,
and although it was very close,</i>

08:07.265 --> 08:08.339
<i>Balthazar Wolf,</i>

08:08.459 --> 08:10.386
<i>you're the winner of "Kitchen Wars,
New York!"</i>

08:11.013 --> 08:12.446
<i>Yeah!</i>

08:13.328 --> 08:14.632
Look at his face.

08:15.514 --> 08:17.220
See how happy he is? Hmm.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.967
He had no idea in eight months,
he'd be dead.

08:20.989 --> 08:22.323
Well, the bank has the warrant,

08:22.324 --> 08:24.126
so we should have his
financials in a couple of hours.

08:24.694 --> 08:26.183
If he was having money troubles,
we'll find out.

08:26.303 --> 08:27.234
Beckett.

08:27.354 --> 08:30.073
Hey, how'd it go with the
late-night soup maker?

08:30.193 --> 08:31.985
You guys find him? Oh,
we found him all right.

08:32.506 --> 08:35.279
In line at the airport with $5,
000 cash in his suitcase

08:35.280 --> 08:36.727
and a one-way ticket to Ecuador.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.049
Mm. Nothing says "I'm guilty"

08:39.051 --> 08:40.770
like an attempt to
flee the country.

The next time you decide to go

08:54.702 --> 08:56.223
all Mr. Freeze on someone,

08:56.343 --> 08:57.974
you should really clean
up after yourself.

08:58.094 --> 08:59.432
We found your bowls in the sink.

08:59.938 --> 09:00.834
I don't understand.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.077
We found you with
a packed suitcase,

09:03.707 --> 09:07.900
plane tickets to Ecuador
and $5,000 in cash.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.283
That is not a crime.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.493
I have a passport.

09:11.494 --> 09:13.063
Which you were using
to flee a murder.

09:13.324 --> 09:14.233
Murder

09:15.158 --> 09:16.411
Who do you think I killed?

09:16.531 --> 09:18.145
Your boss in the big white hat.

09:18.265 --> 09:19.129
Wolf?

09:19.650 --> 09:21.011
Wolf's dead? How?

09:21.131 --> 09:23.166
Mr. Verdugo, sit down.

09:24.621 --> 09:26.004
I did not kill anyone.

09:26.005 --> 09:28.506
We know you came to
see him last night.

09:28.507 --> 09:29.648
Yes

09:30.053 --> 09:32.125
I came back to the
restaurant last night.

09:32.245 --> 09:34.077
My sister, she's in Ecuador.

09:34.078 --> 09:36.112
She's very sick. She needs surgery.

09:36.113 --> 09:38.242
I came to ask chef if can go home.

09:38.831 --> 09:40.647
$5,000 is a lot of money.

09:41.049 --> 09:42.045
Where did you get it from?

09:42.165 --> 09:45.405
Chef Wolf gave it to me
for my sister's operation.

09:45.955 --> 09:47.861
Told him he was crazy,
but he insisted.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.422
He said, "go take
care of your sister."

09:51.130 --> 09:54.296
Look, five years, I've worked
with Wolf. He's my friend.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.263
I didn't kill him.

09:56.383 --> 09:58.445
And he just happened
to have 5 grand on him?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.065
Yes, in his backpack.

10:00.585 --> 10:01.957
Look, I promised to pay him back.

10:02.077 --> 10:03.733
He had that much
money in a backpack?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.241
Yeah, he had more, a lot more.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.542
Look, I told him he shouldn't
carry so much cash.

10:08.662 --> 10:09.786
He could get...

10:11.275 --> 10:12.539
killed.

10:12.855 --> 10:14.911
There was no backpack at the scene.

10:14.912 --> 10:16.419
Maybe that angry lady stole it.

10:16.539 --> 10:17.644
Maybe she's the one
who killed Wolf.

10:17.764 --> 10:18.863
What angry lady?

10:18.983 --> 10:20.352
One of his girlfriends.

10:20.472 --> 10:22.153
I left when she came. When?

10:22.419 --> 10:24.495
After midnight, like around 12:45.

10:24.770 --> 10:25.986
Do you know her name?

10:26.106 --> 10:28.261
No. But she came into the
restaurant all the time.

10:28.381 --> 10:29.562
Can you describe her?

10:32.957 --> 10:34.728
So the kitchen staff confirms

10:34.729 --> 10:37.197
that Wolf did have a
backpack with him yesterday,

10:37.198 --> 10:39.198
and the only reason
that they noticed it

10:39.199 --> 10:40.576
is because he didn't
usually carry one.

10:40.696 --> 10:42.797
Hmm. So Domingo was
telling the truth.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.319
Well, just because
the backpack exists

10:45.439 --> 10:47.625
doesn't mean that the rest
of his story is credible.

10:47.745 --> 10:49.460
No, but he's telling the
truth about the money.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.010
Wolf's financials came in.

10:51.366 --> 10:52.397
There's nothing out of the ordinary

10:52.517 --> 10:56.281
over the last six months,
but then--bam--two weeks ago,

10:56.282 --> 10:58.483
he withdraws all his savings
from his checking account.

10:58.484 --> 11:00.418
$15,000. 2 weeks ago?

11:00.809 --> 11:02.412
That's about the time that Wolf

11:02.532 --> 11:04.756
asked his foster brother
David to buy his share.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.320
Yeah, and as soon as
that check cleared,

11:06.440 --> 11:08.052
he withdrew that $40,000 in cash.

11:08.172 --> 11:09.568
On the day he was killed.

11:09.926 --> 11:11.799
Why would someone need $40,
000 in cash?

11:11.919 --> 11:13.234
Well, nothing legal.

11:13.731 --> 11:15.575
You know, Madison said that
he would disappear every day

11:15.695 --> 11:17.236
between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M.

11:17.356 --> 11:20.067
Maybe where he went had
something to do with the money.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.308
Why don't you guys talk to the
kitchen staff again? Yeah.

11:22.428 --> 11:24.120
And let's look into his
credit card receipts.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.671
Maybe we can figure out
where he was going.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.469
And where are we on
the phone records?

11:28.589 --> 11:30.230
Oh, the SIM card was
damaged from the freezing.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.910
Tech's seeing what
they can salvage.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.457
And we subpoenaed his phone
records from the provider.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.181
We're waiting on those. Okay.

11:37.452 --> 11:39.462
Mm. She looks kinda sketchy to me.

11:41.195 --> 11:42.486
That's Sandra.

11:42.487 --> 11:44.293
She and her husband
are in every Saturday.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.456
Husband?

11:45.576 --> 11:46.241
Yeah.

11:46.361 --> 11:48.362
Domingo hinted at a
romantic relationship.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.324
Which has to violate
several health codes.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.856
Do you remember their last name?

11:53.976 --> 11:54.667
No, no.

11:54.787 --> 11:56.650
But her information should
be in the reservation book.

11:57.726 --> 11:59.389
How you holding up?

11:59.509 --> 12:02.267
I'm still reeling,
and I have no time to grieve.

12:03.017 --> 12:04.862
Wolf was a friend,
but like it or not,

12:04.863 --> 12:06.383
I have to interview
replacement chefs.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.301
I still haven't found
that customer slip

12:08.421 --> 12:11.266
for that cake Wolf was making,
and I have this charity event

12:11.267 --> 12:12.734
tomorrow night at
Rocco Dispirito's.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.124
If I don't show up,

12:14.244 --> 12:16.674
people will think Wolf's
death means the death of Q3.

12:17.592 --> 12:19.043
Hey, maybe you should come with me.

12:19.559 --> 12:20.612
I could use the moral support,

12:20.732 --> 12:22.909
and maybe we can catch
up on old times.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.851
You know, I would love to.
It's just, I have something.

12:25.971 --> 12:27.257
"Something"?

12:30.539 --> 12:32.415
You know, I'm available
for moral support.

12:32.416 --> 12:34.714
And I've been dying to try
out Rocco's new place.

12:34.985 --> 12:37.605
A charming raconteur.
That's just what the doctor ordered.

12:37.725 --> 12:38.760
Thank you, Rick.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.250
Unless that's a problem.

12:40.896 --> 12:42.584
No, not a problem.

12:43.058 --> 12:44.091
Oh, here it is.

12:44.893 --> 12:46.216
Sandra Meyers.

12:49.114 --> 12:50.530
What was the exact nature

12:50.531 --> 12:51.864
of your relationship with Wolf?

12:52.533 --> 12:53.703
Food turns me on.

12:54.122 --> 12:57.209
Not as a sex toy,
but the sensual act of cooking.

12:57.628 --> 12:59.121
And when I saw Wolf
on "Kitchen Wars,"

12:59.241 --> 13:02.201
how passionate he was with his
ingredients, I fell in lust.

13:02.742 --> 13:04.614
My husband and I were the
first through the doors

13:04.615 --> 13:05.715
when Q3 opened.

13:05.835 --> 13:07.498
And when Wolf came by
to check on our meal,

13:07.618 --> 13:08.748
I slipped him my number.

13:08.868 --> 13:12.076
Did you always have
sex in the restaurant?

13:12.439 --> 13:14.222
Well, Wolf did his best
work in the kitchen.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.227
Ow.

13:17.228 --> 13:18.639
And your husband never suspected?

13:18.759 --> 13:20.418
When he's not working
nights at the E.R.,

13:20.538 --> 13:22.130
he's conked out on sleeping pills.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.977
I could shoot porn in my living room,
he'd have no idea.

13:27.059 --> 13:28.123
Are you gonna tell my husband?

13:28.243 --> 13:30.741
You're the primary suspect
in a murder investigation.

13:30.861 --> 13:33.255
Your husband is the
least of your worries.

13:33.375 --> 13:35.344
So what happened
that night, Sandra?

13:35.345 --> 13:37.640
The sex turn deadly? No,
there was no sex.

13:38.074 --> 13:40.149
Two weeks ago,
Wolf called me out of the blue

13:40.150 --> 13:41.367
to tell me we were through.

13:42.039 --> 13:42.807
Two weeks.

13:42.927 --> 13:44.968
I tried calling him,
but he wouldn't call me back.

13:45.088 --> 13:47.035
So I went to the restaurant
last night to find out why.

13:47.155 --> 13:48.180
And?

13:48.491 --> 13:50.526
He said he was done
screwing around,

13:50.527 --> 13:53.696
that it was time to grow up,
turn over a new damn leaf.

13:53.697 --> 13:55.633
And that clearly made you angry.

13:55.909 --> 13:57.200
Sure.

13:57.201 --> 13:58.585
But I didn't kill him.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.180
Mrs. Meyers, you cheat on your
husband on a regular basis.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.470
Why should we believe you?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.388
Ask the doorman at my building.

14:04.508 --> 14:06.009
I was back before 1:30.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.427
When I left the restaurant at 1:15,
Wolf was alive.

14:10.539 --> 14:11.495
Yo.

14:11.771 --> 14:13.513
Doorman confirms Mrs.
Meyers' story,

14:13.875 --> 14:15.202
and the hospital has Dr.
Meyers logged

14:15.322 --> 14:16.343
as working the graveyard shift.

14:16.463 --> 14:18.358
Well, our lying, cheating
wife was telling the truth.

14:18.478 --> 14:20.437
Yeah, but until we figure
out Wolf's time of death,

14:20.557 --> 14:21.650
she's still our best suspect.

14:21.770 --> 14:25.015
Hey. So I ran down Wolf's
daily disappearance.

14:25.016 --> 14:26.484
His credit card records

14:26.803 --> 14:29.252
show a charge at Cafe Rex

14:29.372 --> 14:31.896
every day the last couple
of weeks around 3:45.

14:32.185 --> 14:35.780
Cafe Rex? That's
on 2nd in the 70's.

14:35.781 --> 14:37.882
What was Wolf doing there?
Why don't you guys head up

14:37.883 --> 14:39.458
and see if he was
meeting with anyone?

14:40.485 --> 14:41.554
Beckett.

14:42.584 --> 14:44.254
Okay. We'll be right there.

14:44.255 --> 14:46.955
Come on. Perlmutter
found something.

14:47.739 --> 14:49.034
How's our corpse-sicle?

14:49.154 --> 14:50.369
Thawing nicely.

14:50.489 --> 14:53.093
Uh, in spite of the
obvious challenges,

14:53.094 --> 14:56.429
I found enough unaffected
tissue to narrow time of death

14:56.430 --> 14:58.230
to between 2:00 and 4:00 A.M.

14:58.350 --> 15:00.900
Well, that knocks out both
Domingo and Mrs. Meyers.

15:01.146 --> 15:02.847
Now once we got him
under the heat lamps,

15:02.967 --> 15:04.856
some bruising began to present.

15:05.676 --> 15:06.764
Uh, first...

15:06.884 --> 15:09.096
there were significant contusions

15:09.216 --> 15:11.120
along his back and legs.

15:12.409 --> 15:14.964
Wow. This looks like
a pretty bad beating.

15:15.336 --> 15:16.496
Did this happen the
night of the murder?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.818
Uh, these bruises are
at least two weeks old.

15:19.283 --> 15:21.964
Bruising on the body,
$40,000 in cash...

15:22.563 --> 15:24.480
sold his shares in the diner
to his foster brother...

15:24.600 --> 15:26.421
all within the same
2-week time span.

15:26.824 --> 15:28.650
I also found a fresh bruise

15:28.983 --> 15:31.167
from a blow he suffered
just before he was frozen.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.101
I went through the crime
scene photos from C.S.U.,

15:34.221 --> 15:35.601
and the bruise pattern

15:35.721 --> 15:37.867
matches one of the
objects from the kitchen.

15:38.228 --> 15:38.909
Ah!

15:39.029 --> 15:40.195
Rotary evaporator.

15:40.315 --> 15:43.116
It's a tool that chefs use to
distill and extract flavors

15:43.236 --> 15:46.622
from... and again, you don't care.

15:47.066 --> 15:50.273
Yeah, we didn't find any prints
on the body of the appliance,

15:50.393 --> 15:53.053
but there were some partials
on its shattered glass tube.

15:53.173 --> 15:54.112
Now the guys in the lab

15:54.232 --> 15:56.283
were able to humpty-dumpty
together a usable print.

15:56.403 --> 15:58.383
Didn't match any of the
restaurant employees,

15:58.503 --> 16:01.853
but when they ran it through AFIS,
they got a hit.

16:02.771 --> 16:04.343
Jennifer Wong. <i>No.</i>

16:05.131 --> 16:06.605
Who's Jennifer Wong?

16:06.606 --> 16:08.556
<i>You knew I was using the veal,
so you went</i>

16:08.676 --> 16:10.447
<i>straight to the butcher and bought
everything he had.</i>

16:10.943 --> 16:13.107
<i>You think I care about sabotaging you?</i>

16:13.586 --> 16:14.912
<i>I can cook you off the show</i>

16:14.913 --> 16:16.947
<i>with one hand tied behind my back.</i>

16:16.948 --> 16:18.776
<i>You lost because you cook</i>
<i>with your head.</i>

16:18.896 --> 16:20.738
<i>I cook with my soul.</i>

16:22.742 --> 16:24.075
<i>Oh!</i>

16:24.818 --> 16:26.652
<i> </i>

16:26.653 --> 16:28.986
<i>He's a liar. He stole that
recipe from me.</i>

16:29.421 --> 16:30.594
<i>I swear to God, if Wolf wins,</i>

16:30.714 --> 16:32.662
<i>I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.</i>

16:36.435 --> 16:38.241
<i>He stole that recipe from me.</i>

16:38.746 --> 16:40.563
<i>I swear to God, if Wolf wins,</i>

16:40.683 --> 16:42.197
<i>I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.</i>

16:44.724 --> 16:46.603
Sounds like you and Mr.
Wolf had quite the rivalry.

16:46.723 --> 16:48.472
What about it? Oh, come on.

16:48.863 --> 16:50.420
It had to be difficult,
watching him walk away

16:50.540 --> 16:52.566
with that $100,000 prize.

16:52.842 --> 16:54.600
Not to mention the
publicity and fame

16:54.720 --> 16:55.675
that catapulted his career.

16:55.795 --> 16:57.443
And it's not hard to
believe that the resentment

16:57.563 --> 16:59.239
was building up over the
past couple of months

16:59.359 --> 17:01.903
until the pressure finally
put you over the edge.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.827
Wait. You think <i>I</i> killed him?

17:05.550 --> 17:07.876
That rivalry between Wolf and me...

17:08.165 --> 17:09.483
it was just an act.

17:09.603 --> 17:10.613
An act?

17:10.874 --> 17:13.122
I thought that "Kitchen
Wars" was a reality show.

17:13.643 --> 17:16.482
Emphasis on "show.
" And win or lose,

17:16.602 --> 17:18.330
you want people to remember
your name when it's over.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.067
That's how you build your brand.

17:20.186 --> 17:22.290
And who doesn't remember
a great villain?

17:22.411 --> 17:23.346
Exactly.

17:23.465 --> 17:24.867
Hey, we made for great TV.

17:25.288 --> 17:27.147
Why do you think they kept
us on until the final two?

17:27.268 --> 17:28.002
But then he won.

17:28.123 --> 17:29.742
Personally, I was shocked that

17:29.862 --> 17:31.971
your oven-roasted pork belly
glaze didn't take top prize.

17:32.091 --> 17:33.837
That was... just...

17:34.316 --> 17:36.084
But look, we both won.

17:36.204 --> 17:37.770
Yes, Wolf got his own restaurant,

17:37.890 --> 17:40.121
but I secured financing
for a catering company,

17:40.241 --> 17:41.235
and I'm doing great.

17:41.355 --> 17:42.471
Well, then if you didn't kill him,

17:42.591 --> 17:45.296
maybe you can explain why we
found your prints at the scene.

17:45.614 --> 17:47.509
They were all over the appliance

17:47.629 --> 17:49.006
used to bludgeon Mr. Wolf to death.

17:50.789 --> 17:52.824
Are you talking about
the rotary evaporator?

17:53.847 --> 17:55.398
My prints are on it
because it's mine.

17:55.518 --> 17:57.481
I loaned it to him the
day before yesterday.

17:57.933 --> 18:00.034
He said he needed it to make
something really special.

18:00.154 --> 18:01.642
Wait, you saw him the day he died?

18:02.063 --> 18:04.178
He called me early in the
morning and asked to meet.

18:04.298 --> 18:06.135
Was he carrying a backpack?

18:06.512 --> 18:07.903
Yeah.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.486
He seemed in a rush, like he had

18:11.606 --> 18:13.515
a lot of things to do and
not a lot of time to do it.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.840
I gave him the evaporator,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.827
and then he said he had
a meeting in Midtown.

18:16.947 --> 18:18.699
He asked me to drop him
off on my way home.

18:18.819 --> 18:19.634
And where was that?

18:19.754 --> 18:21.687
Uh, the northeast
corner of 47th and Lex--

18:22.090 --> 18:23.974
one of those big office buildings.

18:25.982 --> 18:27.315
Jennifer's employees confirm

18:27.435 --> 18:29.504
that she had a catering
job in the Hamptons

18:29.874 --> 18:31.308
and that she stayed the night.

18:32.283 --> 18:33.884
Well, just as well.

18:33.885 --> 18:35.383
Her culinary talents
would've been wasted

18:35.503 --> 18:36.495
in a prison kitchen.

18:36.857 --> 18:38.963
Hey, you guys. I need you
to check on the tenants

18:39.083 --> 18:40.263
at this address.

18:40.884 --> 18:42.159
423 East 47th?

18:42.279 --> 18:44.294
Apparently, Wolf visited someone
there the day that he died.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.169
<i>And</i> he had the backpack with him.

18:46.546 --> 18:47.779
Hey, how'd things go Uptown?

18:47.899 --> 18:49.019
Ryan) Well,
we talked to every waiter,

18:49.139 --> 18:50.704
busboy and manager at Cafe Rex.

18:50.824 --> 18:52.609
They remember Wolf
coming in and said he sat

18:52.729 --> 18:55.111
at the same table out front,
but he was always alone.

18:55.231 --> 18:56.187
What was he doing?

18:56.307 --> 18:57.676
Sipping tea, staring.

18:57.951 --> 18:58.873
Sometimes, he ordered the brioche.

18:58.993 --> 19:00.412
That's right. That's it?

19:00.659 --> 19:02.050
Every day for the last two weeks?

19:02.245 --> 19:04.012
Why would he go all the
way to the Upper East Side

19:04.132 --> 19:05.253
just to sit there alone?

19:05.340 --> 19:06.797
Maybe he had a
rendezvous with destiny,

19:06.917 --> 19:07.847
and it stood him up.

19:08.224 --> 19:09.832
Which reminds me, what color shirt

19:09.952 --> 19:11.536
do you think Madison
would like on me?

19:14.425 --> 19:16.234
Going out with
Beckett's old friend?

19:18.167 --> 19:19.712
That's a mistake.

19:19.832 --> 19:21.400
Oh, Beckett didn't seem to mind.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.704
Oh, honey.

19:22.824 --> 19:24.679
Do you want to hand
me an apple? Yeah.

19:25.643 --> 19:27.181
Stop frowning, Alexis,

19:27.426 --> 19:29.455
or your father will freeze
your face like that.

19:29.575 --> 19:30.764
He doesn't have to.

19:30.884 --> 19:32.922
I just found out I have to
study slides with a microscope

19:33.042 --> 19:34.240
for my A.P. Chem exam.

19:34.544 --> 19:36.227
I can't take a microscope
to the Hamptons.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.901
Oh, so you're canceling your trip?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.682
Well, when I'm studying,

19:40.802 --> 19:41.905
I'll want to be on the
beach with the girls,

19:42.025 --> 19:42.828
and when I'm on the beach,

19:42.948 --> 19:44.275
I'll feel guilty for not studying.

19:44.395 --> 19:45.579
Well, don't look at me.

19:45.699 --> 19:48.298
I'm from the "have your
cake and eat it, too" school

19:48.418 --> 19:50.216
of decision making. I say do both.

19:50.336 --> 19:52.376
Or maybe by this weekend,

19:52.496 --> 19:56.563
I'll figure out a way to take
this tank of liquid nitrogen

19:57.590 --> 19:59.666
and build it into
a weather machine.

19:59.786 --> 20:03.075
I'll make it rain, your friends
will have to cancel their trip.

20:03.195 --> 20:04.161
You won't have to choose,

20:04.281 --> 20:06.220
and then we can
take over the world!

20:09.149 --> 20:10.353
Not helpful.

20:11.454 --> 20:12.469
But evil.

20:13.555 --> 20:14.776
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your date?

20:15.210 --> 20:17.066
Mm. Shouldn't you be
back home with Chet?

20:17.834 --> 20:18.820
Oh, you're right. I...

20:18.940 --> 20:20.664
Hey.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.224
I froze time.

20:26.795 --> 20:27.864
Maddie?

20:27.984 --> 20:28.934
Oh, hey.

20:29.054 --> 20:30.983
You look amazing.

20:31.103 --> 20:34.461
Thanks. Hey, I, um...
I wanted to drop this off.

20:35.012 --> 20:36.931
It's my way of saying thank you

20:37.395 --> 20:38.517
for everything you guys are doing.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.319
Oh, y-- You know, it's what we do.

20:41.898 --> 20:44.317
But we are always very
grateful for cookies.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.687
I love oatmeal cookies.

20:47.807 --> 20:48.761
I'm glad.

20:49.328 --> 20:50.705
Hey, Becks...

20:51.010 --> 20:52.270
Do you remember
when we used to like

20:52.390 --> 20:54.201
the same guy in English class?

20:54.321 --> 20:56.185
Yes. Brent Edwards. Yes.

20:56.475 --> 20:57.724
He was very hot.

20:57.844 --> 20:58.992
Yes.

21:00.181 --> 21:02.945
Do you also remember what
happened senior year?

21:04.003 --> 21:05.237
Uh, yeah. Why?

21:05.744 --> 21:07.515
This date with Rick.

21:08.530 --> 21:09.758
If you guys are at all...

21:09.878 --> 21:11.655
Castle? N-no.

21:12.857 --> 21:14.024
Are you sure?

21:14.328 --> 21:15.533
Because I really wouldn't want

21:15.653 --> 21:17.381
Brent Edwards to
happen all over again?

21:19.323 --> 21:20.540
Trust me. It's not.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.242
Okay. Great.

21:23.778 --> 21:25.035
So have fun tonight.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.120
Thanks. You, too.

21:31.262 --> 21:32.219
Hey.

21:32.610 --> 21:34.321
Hey. Uh, so you ready?

21:34.441 --> 21:36.788
No. My lieutenant just
brought down the hammer.

21:37.585 --> 21:39.667
Fives have to be written up
before shift end tonight.

21:39.787 --> 21:41.297
I'm sorry. Uh, no.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.544
Uh, you know, I have--

21:43.664 --> 21:44.848
I have, uh, some
paperwork to do as well.

21:44.968 --> 21:46.176
So maybe another time.

21:46.524 --> 21:49.246
Well, the thing is,
I kinda had my heart set on tonight.

21:50.949 --> 21:52.247
You like chinese?

21:52.367 --> 21:53.526
It's my favorite.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.328
Great. Wait here.

22:03.903 --> 22:05.722
Madison, I'm so sorry. Hi.

22:05.842 --> 22:08.195
It's a tragic loss.
Wolf was a good friend.

22:08.315 --> 22:10.162
Yeah, he really admired you.

22:10.282 --> 22:12.253
Thanks for coming tonight.
It means a lot to me.

22:12.572 --> 22:14.128
Rocco, this is Richard Castle.

22:14.389 --> 22:16.120
I ought to punch you
in the face, Castle...

22:17.453 --> 22:19.183
For killing Derrick
storm like that.

22:19.303 --> 22:22.316
He was my favorite character.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.711
But I'll admit,
"Heat Wave's" fun, too.

22:24.831 --> 22:26.249
Based on my friend, Kate Beckett.

22:27.017 --> 22:29.197
I should introduce you.
You guys might hit it off.

22:30.092 --> 22:31.088
I'd like that.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.233
If she's half as interesting in
person as she is on the page,

22:33.480 --> 22:34.920
I think I like her already.

22:35.040 --> 22:35.943
Well, you guys have fun.
Enjoy your dinner.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.145
Thanks.

22:37.580 --> 22:38.584
Fabulous chef.

22:40.363 --> 22:42.769
You... you really think
he's Beckett's type?

22:42.889 --> 22:44.846
Well, Becks never had a type.

22:45.629 --> 22:47.467
She dated a guitarist
in a grunge band,

22:47.587 --> 22:49.485
a med student and this french guy,

22:49.605 --> 22:51.650
but I'm pretty sure he
was some kind of royalty.

22:52.650 --> 22:53.852
Who is she seeing now?

22:54.504 --> 22:56.580
Oh, just... some guy.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.183
I don't see it going anywhere.

23:03.896 --> 23:05.075
This food's amazing.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.589
Where did you get it from?

23:06.709 --> 23:08.599
Hung's China Sea.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.773
Oh, get out.
Hung's doesn't deliver.

23:11.048 --> 23:12.853
Well, he delivers to me.

23:13.621 --> 23:15.729
Mr. Hung had this medal--

23:16.288 --> 23:18.317
a 15th-century chinese medal,
Ming Dynasty.

23:18.437 --> 23:20.253
It was passed down through
the generations, right?

23:20.512 --> 23:22.816
Well, last year it was
stolen along with some cash

23:22.936 --> 23:24.393
and some kitchen
appliances and whatnot.

23:24.849 --> 23:27.153
The only thing that mattered to Mr.
Hung was the medal.

23:28.197 --> 23:29.827
So I got it back for him.

23:29.947 --> 23:32.425
And because I delivered,
now so does he.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.100
Really?

23:34.853 --> 23:35.758
Hmm.

23:36.464 --> 23:38.090
Well, then maybe I should
get you to figure out

23:38.210 --> 23:40.584
why our victim was carrying
a backpack full of cash.

23:41.062 --> 23:42.190
Well, maybe you should.

23:42.495 --> 23:43.908
You know, I got some
guys on the street.

23:44.227 --> 23:45.610
If you want, I can put out feelers,

23:45.730 --> 23:46.749
see if anybody knows anything.

23:46.869 --> 23:48.213
Yeah, sure.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.038
Excuse me, Detectives. Hey, guys.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.987
Wow. Nice candle. Come on in.

23:53.107 --> 23:53.885
What'd you find?

23:54.005 --> 23:56.160
Well, we checked the sign-in
log at that building

23:56.280 --> 23:58.568
where Jennifer wong
dropped off Wolf. Mm-hmm.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.809
Turns out he was seeing a guy
named Simon Haim, esquire.

24:02.142 --> 24:04.232
He was delivering a backpack
full of cash to a lawyer?

24:04.352 --> 24:05.566
Well, according to Mr. Haim,

24:05.686 --> 24:07.090
Wolf had the backpack
in his possession,

24:07.210 --> 24:09.303
but he never opened it and he
never even mentioned the cash.

24:09.423 --> 24:12.048
But he did mention your
High School friend Madison.

24:12.168 --> 24:14.343
Apparently, Wolf wanted
out of his contract.

24:14.463 --> 24:15.696
He wanted to leave the restaurant,

24:15.816 --> 24:17.519
and he wanted his investment back.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.857
But the restaurant just opened.
Why would he want to leave?

24:19.977 --> 24:21.345
Creative differences,

24:21.465 --> 24:22.959
but Ms. Queller refused
to release him.

24:23.079 --> 24:24.180
Wolf was planning to sue.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.758
She'd built the restaurant
on his reputation.

24:26.878 --> 24:29.018
If he left, she would've
lost everything.

24:29.613 --> 24:32.675
So what happens to Q3
now that Wolf is dead?

24:32.795 --> 24:34.208
She had business insurance on him.

24:34.328 --> 24:35.404
So with the payout,

24:35.794 --> 24:38.084
Madison gets the restaurant,
free and clear.

24:38.402 --> 24:41.156
Wolf's death protects her from
potentially losing $2 million

24:41.276 --> 24:43.127
in real estate,
appliances and fixtures.

24:43.645 --> 24:45.079
Sounds like motive to me.

24:46.473 --> 24:51.691
♪

24:53.276 --> 24:55.287
Mmm.

24:56.310 --> 24:57.846
Mmm. Mmm.

24:57.966 --> 25:00.484
This... Mmm. Mmm.

25:00.604 --> 25:02.131
Right? Mm. Oh, my God.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.391
This is...

25:03.511 --> 25:05.494
This caviar parfait is delicious.

25:05.885 --> 25:08.559
Trade you for some of
my black truffle Risotto

25:08.679 --> 25:09.815
with crispy shrimp.

25:09.935 --> 25:12.690
Oh, well... how could I resist?

25:14.763 --> 25:16.154
Mmm. Oh.

25:16.274 --> 25:17.586
Mmm. That is...

25:18.572 --> 25:19.713
I'm sorry to interrupt.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.615
Hey. Beckett.

25:23.636 --> 25:24.617
What are you doing here?

25:24.737 --> 25:26.744
I-I need to ask Madison
a few questions.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.300
Oh, well, pull up a chair.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.742
Not here. Downtown.

25:33.902 --> 25:35.069
You realize Madison and I

25:35.070 --> 25:36.837
weren't halfway through
our tasting menus

25:36.838 --> 25:38.257
when you stomped in there
like the fun police?

25:38.377 --> 25:41.338
What part of her being a suspect
in a murder investigation

25:41.458 --> 25:42.314
do you not get?

25:42.434 --> 25:43.564
The waiter was about to come out

25:43.684 --> 25:45.208
with the duck confit en croute,

25:45.483 --> 25:47.222
Rocco Dispirito's Pumpkin gnocchi,

25:47.342 --> 25:48.835
not to mention the langoustine,

25:48.955 --> 25:50.614
the lavender crème brûlèe
that was coming up.

25:50.734 --> 25:52.516
And don't even get me started
on the wine pairings.

25:53.571 --> 25:55.920
I'm just saying,
you could've been more civilized

25:55.921 --> 25:57.889
and allowed us to finish
our meal. Unh-unh.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.524
You can watch from
the observation room.

26:00.644 --> 26:01.614
And now...

26:02.305 --> 26:03.363
And now you're benching me?

26:03.483 --> 26:06.153
You were just giggling
over the Risotto

26:06.273 --> 26:07.703
with our suspect.

26:08.298 --> 26:09.697
Which was to die for, by the way.

26:12.263 --> 26:14.741
Okay. Next time I'm
hitting on a guy you like,

26:15.074 --> 26:16.660
come clean with me
before I go out with him

26:16.780 --> 26:18.974
so you don't have to arrest
me to break up the date.

26:18.975 --> 26:20.960
Madison, that's not-- no,
no, no, no, no.

26:21.080 --> 26:21.809
I get it.

26:21.929 --> 26:23.223
You're hot for Castle.

26:23.803 --> 26:25.336
You want to make
little Castle babies.

26:25.655 --> 26:27.115
Why couldn't you just
be honest? Maddie.

26:27.376 --> 26:28.821
What? He can hear us.

26:28.822 --> 26:31.525
Oh, really? Yes.

26:31.645 --> 26:33.140
Rick's behind the mirror? Yeah.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.680
Oh. Like on tv?

26:38.845 --> 26:41.672
Hey there! Sorry we missed
the Pumpkin gnocchi.

26:41.792 --> 26:42.972
They're really good.

26:45.934 --> 26:47.524
I have to Tweet about this.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.240
Madison, put the phone down.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.214
Sit.

27:01.989 --> 27:03.219
You lied to me.

27:03.339 --> 27:05.386
You knew that Wolf
wanted out of Q3,

27:05.506 --> 27:07.063
and you knew that he
was gonna Sue you.

27:07.367 --> 27:08.093
You know about that?

27:08.213 --> 27:10.485
Yeah, I know about that.
Okay, but I didn't lie.

27:10.804 --> 27:12.579
I just neglected to
say anything about it.

27:13.202 --> 27:14.565
Okay, you know how hard it is

27:14.685 --> 27:16.361
to open a restaurant in Manhattan?

27:16.781 --> 27:18.868
If word got out that
Wolf was trying to leave,

27:18.988 --> 27:20.058
it would've ruined me.

27:20.178 --> 27:21.085
But if he dies,

27:21.205 --> 27:23.662
with your insurance policy,
you make out just fine.

27:23.909 --> 27:26.407
So what happened, Maddie?
Did you guys get into a fight?

27:26.527 --> 27:27.589
Did you throw something at him?

27:27.709 --> 27:29.616
Because I remember you
throwing things at people

27:29.736 --> 27:30.396
when you got angry.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.777
Oh, come on.
Don't you people have rules

27:31.897 --> 27:33.756
about using personal
knowledge against suspects?

27:33.876 --> 27:35.879
Maddie, you better start
being straight with me.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.735
Becks, I didn't kill him.

27:40.347 --> 27:41.449
Two weeks ago,

27:41.869 --> 27:43.462
Wolf tells me he wants out
of the restaurant biz,

27:43.810 --> 27:45.656
completely out of nowhere.

27:45.917 --> 27:47.420
Says he's trying
to change his life.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.426
Now I'm thinking
he's being poached.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.361
So I start offering
better equipment,

27:51.607 --> 27:54.086
a bigger piece in the business,
whatever he wants.

27:54.087 --> 27:55.987
He insists he's really getting out

27:55.988 --> 27:57.421
and that I can't change his mind.

27:57.541 --> 28:00.568
It was like something
changed in his life.

28:01.877 --> 28:04.124
Now I was gonna let him
out of his contract.

28:04.244 --> 28:06.491
I just needed time
to find a new chef.

28:07.032 --> 28:09.080
But I swear, Becks,
I didn't kill him.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.972
You don't really think
she did it, do you?

28:16.092 --> 28:17.397
Well, until I can rule her out,

28:17.398 --> 28:18.603
it doesn't matter what I think.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.015
She has motive.
Yeah, she also has an alibi,

28:21.135 --> 28:22.457
which you're conveniently ignoring.

28:22.577 --> 28:24.668
I'm not ignoring.
I'm just rechecking.

28:25.146 --> 28:27.432
I asked her to stay
in town in any case.

28:27.552 --> 28:29.097
Yes, I know. I heard...

28:29.808 --> 28:30.742
Everything.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.774
Uh...

28:35.894 --> 28:38.361
So, uh, selling his
stake in the restaurant,

28:38.481 --> 28:41.038
a backpack full of cash...

28:41.158 --> 28:42.726
That sounds like Wolf was
getting ready to run.

28:42.846 --> 28:43.922
Yes, but from what?

28:44.042 --> 28:45.494
Hey, you guys. Hey.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.542
I'm so sorry to cut
out on you earlier.

28:47.662 --> 28:48.413
No worries.

28:48.533 --> 28:49.934
It gave me time to put
the word out on your Vic.

28:50.054 --> 28:50.972
And?

28:51.674 --> 28:54.583
Well, a guy I know runs paper
for a local bookmaking ring.

28:54.703 --> 28:56.049
Turns out he's a bit of a foodie.

28:56.513 --> 28:58.289
He clocked Wolf doing
business with a bookie

28:58.409 --> 29:01.244
at two Bridges bar. Apparently,
your boy likes to bet big.

29:01.672 --> 29:02.716
He was in deep with a bookie.

29:02.836 --> 29:04.328
That explains the
beating and the cash.

29:04.448 --> 29:06.015
Does this bookie have a name?

29:06.713 --> 29:07.823
Wesley Slade?

29:08.388 --> 29:10.352
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

29:10.353 --> 29:12.454
We're investigating the
murder of Balthazar Wolf.

29:12.850 --> 29:13.815
Never heard of him.

29:15.269 --> 29:17.453
Really? Well,
given the marks on his body

29:17.573 --> 29:18.578
after the beating
your boys gave him,

29:18.698 --> 29:19.604
I think you have.

29:19.865 --> 29:20.735
What happened?

29:20.855 --> 29:22.755
He get in too deep with you,
so you had to take him out?

29:22.875 --> 29:25.097
You really think I'm gonna
tell my business to a cop?

29:25.217 --> 29:26.883
It's either that or you
face murder charges.

29:27.003 --> 29:28.173
That can't be good for business.

29:29.171 --> 29:31.472
<i>♪</i>

29:32.185 --> 29:33.504
All right.

29:34.099 --> 29:36.713
Let's say, hypothetically,
that I made book for him.

29:37.011 --> 29:40.284
And let's say for the sake of
argument that he owed me a lot.

29:40.404 --> 29:43.258
How much, hypothetically? 25 thou,

29:43.501 --> 29:45.432
which <i>maybe</i> he couldn't pay.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.694
So <i>maybe</i> he needed some
encouragement.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.582
Maybe the encouragement
went too far.

29:50.053 --> 29:51.251
Or maybe it was the right amount.

29:51.987 --> 29:54.583
So he paid what he owed
and went his merry way.

29:54.890 --> 29:55.541
When?

29:55.778 --> 29:58.245
The day he died, he comes in
with a backpack full of cash,

29:58.365 --> 30:01.664
puts 25 thou on the table
and asks for his ring back.

30:01.939 --> 30:03.439
His ring? What kind of ring?

30:03.990 --> 30:05.628
Diamond engagement ring.

30:05.903 --> 30:07.163
Why'd you have it?

30:07.602 --> 30:08.784
Hypothetically.

30:09.392 --> 30:12.244
Couple of weeks back,
I sent my guys to collect,

30:12.364 --> 30:14.879
didn't have the money,
gave some sob story about a woman,

30:14.999 --> 30:16.965
how he spent everything
he had on a diamond ring.

30:17.502 --> 30:21.109
So when my guys go to give
him some... encouragement,

30:21.110 --> 30:23.246
oh, what do they find?
A nice diamond ring. Nice.

30:23.580 --> 30:27.274
Must have set him back 10,
15 grand... of my money.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.850
So your guys took
it for collateral?

30:29.851 --> 30:31.719
No, as incentive.

30:32.371 --> 30:33.639
And it worked.

30:33.944 --> 30:35.726
I got my money, he got his ring,

30:36.294 --> 30:38.633
and he goes home alive...
hypothetically.

30:39.548 --> 30:41.247
<i>♪</i>

30:42.264 --> 30:43.997
An engagement ring
makes perfect sense.

30:44.406 --> 30:46.065
That's why he broke things
off with Mrs. Meyers.

30:46.066 --> 30:49.234
That's why he took $15,
000 out of his account 2 weeks ago.

30:49.235 --> 30:51.171
Well, then where is it?

30:51.172 --> 30:52.461
He went to the
restaurant right after,

30:52.581 --> 30:54.136
and we didn't find it
at the crime scene.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.433
Unless we did find it and
we just didn't know it.

30:58.024 --> 30:58.828
Just straight back.

30:58.948 --> 30:59.667
Thank you.

30:59.787 --> 31:02.971
You remember what Spike was saying
about why Wolf was staying late?

31:03.091 --> 31:04.922
Yeah, he was finishing
off that cake.

31:10.218 --> 31:11.686
A cake...

31:13.650 --> 31:16.115
with a heart-shaped mold on it.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.332
He wasn't running away.

31:25.452 --> 31:26.603
He was going to propose.

31:27.037 --> 31:27.935
But to who?

31:28.055 --> 31:29.763
And why hasn't she
come forward yet?

31:29.883 --> 31:32.232
Maybe she's scared.
Maybe she's in danger.

31:33.249 --> 31:35.414
Or maybe she killed him.

31:44.317 --> 31:46.800
Who puts an engagement
ring inside a cake?

31:47.212 --> 31:48.061
It's romantic.

31:48.226 --> 31:50.579
Oh, pl-- it's a choking hazard.

31:50.699 --> 31:53.861
I swear, men act as though
there's some cosmic reward

31:53.981 --> 31:55.646
for crazy proposals.

31:55.766 --> 31:58.676
And what a woman really wants
is a man down on one knee,

31:58.981 --> 32:00.947
tears in his eyes,
ring in his hand.

32:01.369 --> 32:03.812
My proposal to Gina
was very romantic.

32:04.207 --> 32:07.795
A balloon ride is lovely,
but not in February.

32:08.522 --> 32:10.366
Her hand was shaking
so much from the cold,

32:10.486 --> 32:11.604
it was difficult
getting that ring on.

32:11.724 --> 32:12.730
It was a sign.

32:12.850 --> 32:14.546
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

32:15.718 --> 32:17.183
So have you decided?

32:17.677 --> 32:18.998
No.

32:20.664 --> 32:21.797
Ah.

32:23.203 --> 32:24.224
Again, David,

32:24.344 --> 32:25.703
I'm sorry for your loss.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.554
Hey.

32:29.764 --> 32:30.709
Shed any light?

32:30.829 --> 32:32.781
So David said that he
wouldn't have believed it

32:32.901 --> 32:34.497
unless I'd shown him the ring.

32:34.617 --> 32:37.088
He had no idea who
Wolf was proposing to,

32:37.208 --> 32:38.840
and neither did anyone
else in his life.

32:39.523 --> 32:41.310
It's like the guy was
in love with a ghost.

32:41.430 --> 32:43.760
Ooh, that'd be cool,
if it was actually a ghost.

32:44.646 --> 32:45.721
Went back through the phone logs

32:45.841 --> 32:47.186
from the restaurant
and Wolf's cell.

32:47.306 --> 32:48.431
Every call's accounted for.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.760
What about the cafe Uptown?

32:49.880 --> 32:50.969
The waitstaff all checked out.

32:51.089 --> 32:52.811
They're adamant that Wolf
never met anybody there.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.706
How do you have a
relationship with somebody

32:54.826 --> 32:55.752
without leaving any evidence?

32:55.872 --> 32:57.014
Maybe the ring wasn't his.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.711
Maybe he was holding
it for a friend.

32:58.831 --> 33:01.229
No, it had to be his.
Look at his behavior--

33:01.740 --> 33:03.948
he stops sleeping around,
he was paying off his debts,

33:04.068 --> 33:05.854
he sold the one thing in
life he actually cared about

33:06.099 --> 33:07.232
just to get that ring back.

33:07.711 --> 33:09.512
There's only one reason
a man cleans up his act.

33:09.876 --> 33:10.733
Ahh.

33:10.853 --> 33:12.837
Yeah, but murder isn't the
usual response to a proposal.

33:13.273 --> 33:14.526
Unless you got something to lose.

33:15.005 --> 33:16.219
He did like married women.

33:16.669 --> 33:18.687
All right. Have C.S.U.
resweep his apartment.

33:18.807 --> 33:20.329
If this girl spent any time there,

33:20.620 --> 33:22.087
she must have left
some evidence behind.

33:23.225 --> 33:25.306
Hey, Maddie. Thanks for coming.

33:25.426 --> 33:26.756
I thought you said
I was off the hook.

33:27.032 --> 33:28.470
Yeah, uh, witnesses have you

33:28.590 --> 33:30.153
at the party until after
the time of death.

33:30.444 --> 33:31.267
Then why am I here?

33:32.384 --> 33:33.938
Anyone ever offered
you one of these?

33:34.058 --> 33:35.697
No. You?

33:36.598 --> 33:37.683
Not yet.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.452
I had no idea Wolf was
even serious with anyone.

33:40.858 --> 33:42.501
Can you think of any girl
that he was close to?

33:42.908 --> 33:45.258
Every time I saw him,
he was with someone different.

33:46.288 --> 33:47.596
It's hard to believe
he'd ever commit.

33:47.930 --> 33:50.498
The guy lived his job 24/7.
It had to be somebody

33:50.618 --> 33:52.091
at the restaurant. Not necessarily.

33:52.211 --> 33:54.112
I've fallen in love with
random women on the subway.

33:54.475 --> 33:56.039
Well, if you can think
of anyone, call me.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.462
Yeah. And, Becks...

33:57.582 --> 33:58.805
I'm sorry...

33:59.488 --> 34:00.853
About lying to you.

34:01.812 --> 34:03.190
And I might have come down

34:03.310 --> 34:04.670
a little harder than I needed to.

34:05.019 --> 34:06.742
I've fallen I love with
operators on the phone.

34:06.994 --> 34:08.373
Even asked one out a
couple of years ago,

34:08.494 --> 34:10.498
but she was in Bangladesh.

34:11.138 --> 34:13.333
Yeah, I guess I wasn't
seeing you as a cop,

34:13.453 --> 34:16.245
but as my friend-- you know,
the girl

34:16.364 --> 34:18.286
who stole her mom's makeup
to give me a makeover,

34:19.049 --> 34:19.978
the first who told me

34:20.098 --> 34:22.159
that kissing boys might
involve some tongue.

34:22.279 --> 34:24.047
Oh, yeah.

34:24.168 --> 34:26.591
I bought a falafel from this
stand every day for two months

34:26.710 --> 34:28.025
just so I could talk
to the falafel girl.

34:28.145 --> 34:29.510
Yeah, you mean like
Demming showing up

34:29.630 --> 34:30.980
every morning for coffee
just to run into Beckett?

34:40.120 --> 34:41.195
What?

34:41.315 --> 34:43.949
The one who dragged me

34:44.069 --> 34:47.101
to stand outside Brent Edwards'
brownstone for hours on end

34:47.221 --> 34:49.335
just to catch a glimpse
of him through the window.

34:51.699 --> 34:52.938
Through the window.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.445
Oh.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.577
Wolf wasn't going to Cafe
Rex to meet his girl.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.423
He was watching her
out the cafe window.

34:58.543 --> 34:59.621
That's why there
were no phone calls.

34:59.741 --> 35:02.587
He was trying to gather up the
courage to propose to her.

35:06.383 --> 35:07.770
So that's the store

35:07.890 --> 35:09.686
with the clearest
view from the cafe.

35:09.806 --> 35:11.294
Well, either our mystery
girl works here,

35:12.074 --> 35:14.394
or Wolf was really
into women's clothes.

35:15.963 --> 35:17.140
Maybe it's him.

35:17.884 --> 35:19.344
Maybe that's Wolf's big secret.

35:20.992 --> 35:22.575
That's not his secret.

35:23.095 --> 35:24.443
She is.

35:24.563 --> 35:26.361
That's his foster
brother's girlfriend.

35:26.752 --> 35:28.298
Yep.

35:29.233 --> 35:34.697
Well, it definitely
made proposing tricky.

35:39.990 --> 35:41.708
I don't understand. Why am I here?

35:42.071 --> 35:44.004
How well did you know Wolf, Cecily?

35:44.556 --> 35:45.690
He was like family.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.777
So you knew him for a long time.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.603
Well, ten years,
ever since David's father

35:49.723 --> 35:51.027
hired me at his restaurant.

35:51.147 --> 35:52.969
Did the two of you ever...

35:54.291 --> 35:55.468
Why are you asking me this?

35:55.918 --> 35:57.318
Every day for the last two weeks,

35:57.438 --> 35:59.113
Wolf went to Cafe Rex,

35:59.233 --> 36:00.792
which is right across the
street from where you work.

36:01.142 --> 36:02.842
He would just sit there
and look out the window.

36:02.962 --> 36:03.815
Looking at you.

36:03.935 --> 36:05.127
Now why would he do that?

36:06.188 --> 36:07.878
I don't know. I think you do.

36:08.415 --> 36:10.231
In the last two weeks,
Wolf made a lot of changes.

36:10.507 --> 36:13.468
He'd stopped sleeping around,
paid off all his debts...

36:13.588 --> 36:14.612
and he bought this...

36:15.310 --> 36:16.832
For you.

36:16.952 --> 36:19.939
What makes a man-
a self-professed bad boy--

36:20.563 --> 36:22.627
suddenly declare himself
after ten years?

36:23.121 --> 36:24.343
Unless something changed.

36:24.463 --> 36:26.075
Cecily, these are
your phone records.

36:27.179 --> 36:30.492
Four months ago, you started
calling your ob/gyn regularly.

36:31.669 --> 36:33.947
You're pregnant.
It's Wolf's, isn't it?

36:34.528 --> 36:35.808
No one was supposed to know.

36:35.928 --> 36:37.086
It was supposed to be my secret.

36:37.769 --> 36:39.570
But when David told
Wolf we were pregnant,

36:40.354 --> 36:41.745
somehow he knew. He...

36:42.980 --> 36:44.287
He... he knew.

36:45.306 --> 36:46.862
God, you must think I'm awful.

36:47.312 --> 36:49.693
It's not my job to judge.
I'm just here to get the truth.

36:50.187 --> 36:52.885
David's father had just died,
so David went out of the country

36:53.005 --> 36:54.415
to bury his father in his hometown.

36:54.967 --> 36:56.174
Wolf came by.

36:56.987 --> 36:58.543
He held my hand,
and I remembered...

36:59.620 --> 37:02.532
how much I loved him,
that I'd always loved him.

37:02.938 --> 37:04.985
If you loved him so much,
why stay with David?

37:05.726 --> 37:07.244
Because David doesn't leave.

37:07.883 --> 37:10.212
David doesn't sleep with
every girl who walks by.

37:10.823 --> 37:12.283
You have no idea how hard it is

37:12.403 --> 37:14.053
to love someone, knowing
they're gonna break your heart.

37:15.607 --> 37:17.252
If I couldn't trust him as a man,

37:17.372 --> 37:18.712
how could he be a father?

37:19.889 --> 37:21.163
I had to make a choice.

37:22.330 --> 37:23.725
Oh, God. Please don't tell David.

37:23.845 --> 37:25.575
Are you sure he
doesn't already know?

37:25.695 --> 37:27.473
Where was he the night
that Wolf was murdered?

37:27.593 --> 37:30.303
At home... with me in bed.

37:30.776 --> 37:31.764
All night?

37:33.667 --> 37:34.583
Oh, God.

37:34.703 --> 37:35.832
What?

37:36.939 --> 37:38.450
I had been having trouble sleeping.

37:38.915 --> 37:40.208
So David gave me a pill,

37:40.328 --> 37:41.730
the kind the doctor said was okay.

37:43.168 --> 37:45.638
It was the only time he's
ever given me a pill.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.296
Hey, man. Take him
to the hole, please?

37:53.416 --> 37:55.731
Sure. Yeah, lock him up.
We'll be right over.

37:55.851 --> 37:57.430
Come on. Let's go.

37:57.550 --> 37:59.181
He's not talking.
Yeah, but he didn't have to.

37:59.301 --> 38:01.100
We found Wolf's backpack
in their apartment

38:01.299 --> 38:02.488
along with the extra cash.

38:02.664 --> 38:04.027
We also found a pair of his shoes

38:04.147 --> 38:05.494
with cracked soles from
the liquid nitrogen.

38:05.714 --> 38:07.338
I can't imagine the
betrayal he must have felt.

38:07.642 --> 38:09.288
It's still not an excuse to kill.

38:11.773 --> 38:12.910
You ask me...

38:13.419 --> 38:14.836
she should've followed her heart--

38:14.956 --> 38:16.469
left David, gone with Wolf.

38:16.589 --> 38:18.346
You know, I can see
the virtue in staying.

38:18.884 --> 38:20.564
I mean, guys like Wolf,
they come in,

38:20.684 --> 38:22.143
they upset the apple cart.

38:23.087 --> 38:24.468
Of course he makes you feel alive,

38:24.588 --> 38:26.611
but eventually, you know
he's just gonna let you down.

38:26.731 --> 38:28.152
So why risk it?

38:29.387 --> 38:31.043
Because the heart wants
what the heart wants.

38:33.281 --> 38:34.351
Speaking of...

38:34.471 --> 38:35.756
I gotta get outta here.

38:36.730 --> 38:37.950
Madison?

38:38.070 --> 38:39.494
No. Actually,
with everything going on,

38:39.614 --> 38:40.926
she said she didn't
have time to date.

38:41.046 --> 38:42.364
She didn't tell you that? Mnh-mnh.

38:42.484 --> 38:44.239
So I gotta get home.

38:44.359 --> 38:46.776
Alexis has a little
head-heart problem of her own,

38:47.634 --> 38:49.233
and I want to be there
for the decision.

38:54.148 --> 38:55.950
Case closed?

38:56.472 --> 38:57.460
Yes.

38:58.331 --> 38:59.853
Thank you so much for
all of your help.

38:59.973 --> 39:01.098
Anytime.

39:01.218 --> 39:03.114
But, you know, we never
really finished our dinner.

39:03.324 --> 39:04.499
No more fives.

39:04.934 --> 39:06.799
You want to grab a beer
and a burger at Remy's?

39:07.133 --> 39:09.519
You know, I would love to,
it's, just, uh...

39:10.759 --> 39:12.197
can I take a rain check?

39:12.851 --> 39:13.933
Somewhere else you need to be?

39:14.282 --> 39:15.357
Yeah.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.649
How about tomorrow?

39:17.769 --> 39:19.354
Yeah. You're on.

39:19.601 --> 39:21.592
Okay. All right.

39:28.851 --> 39:30.217
Oh.

39:30.337 --> 39:32.520
You decided to go away for the
weekend with your friends.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.595
They're picking me up in an hour.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.399
You don't sound thrilled
with your decision.

39:36.519 --> 39:37.315
I'm not.

39:37.435 --> 39:39.509
I feel awful about it,
but either way, it's the same.

39:40.352 --> 39:41.613
Well, is there anything I can do

39:41.733 --> 39:43.159
to make it easier on you?

39:45.062 --> 39:46.268
Yes.

39:46.515 --> 39:48.048
You can order me to stay home.

39:48.528 --> 39:49.690
Y-you're serious?

39:51.477 --> 39:52.608
All right.

39:54.932 --> 39:57.663
Alexis, your A.P.
exams are far too important

39:57.783 --> 39:59.809
for you to go gallivanting
around the weekend

39:59.929 --> 40:01.191
with your friends at the beach.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.545
You have to stay home
and study. I insist.

40:07.344 --> 40:08.479
Oh, I gotta call Lacey.

40:12.426 --> 40:14.385
Lacey. Yeah, I'm so sorry.

40:14.505 --> 40:16.462
But my dad <i>just</i>
told me I can't go.

40:17.334 --> 40:20.058
I have to stay home and study
for exams this weekend.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.577
Yeah, I know. I know.
Can you believe it?

40:22.970 --> 40:25.273
Yeah, so much for having
a cool dad. Dude--

40:25.393 --> 40:26.494
well, I'm sorry.

40:26.614 --> 40:28.484
And just take lots of
pictures and text 'em to me.

40:29.021 --> 40:30.692
Okay. Bye.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.199
Thank you.

40:34.405 --> 40:35.770
You won't be thanking
me when you see

40:35.890 --> 40:37.057
what I have planned
for this weekend.

40:38.771 --> 40:41.393
1,001 ways to distract
someone who's studying.

40:41.513 --> 40:43.881
We start by freezing
ping-pong balls. Hey!

40:44.142 --> 40:45.686
Okay, guys, let's
remember to be sharp,

40:45.806 --> 40:47.537
respectful and attentive. Okay?

40:47.657 --> 40:49.714
Have a good night. Hey!

40:49.834 --> 40:51.950
Hey, you're reopening. Yes.

40:52.070 --> 40:54.097
I found a hot new chef to
step into Wolf's shoes.

40:54.217 --> 40:55.468
Oh, that's so great. Yeah.

40:55.588 --> 40:58.159
Hello, Detective. You're not
here to question me again?

40:58.279 --> 41:00.266
No, I'm just here as a friend.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.381
Congratulations. Thank you.

41:03.150 --> 41:05.683
So David killed Wolf? Yeah.

41:05.803 --> 41:07.775
It turns out that he
intercepted a text

41:07.895 --> 41:09.637
that Wolf sent Cecily
asking about the baby.

41:09.757 --> 41:11.453
And at first, he was gonna
approach Cecily about it

41:11.573 --> 41:13.691
until he realized that
eventually she would leave him

41:13.811 --> 41:14.859
as long as Wolf was alive.

41:14.979 --> 41:17.052
Wow. Very Kane and Abel.

41:17.172 --> 41:19.501
Yeah. So I take it
that you're swamped.

41:19.621 --> 41:21.148
Always. Why?

41:22.077 --> 41:23.559
I thought that we could
get a drink and catch up.

41:23.679 --> 41:24.504
That'd be great.

41:24.780 --> 41:27.102
<i>Apparently,</i> we have a lot
of catching up to do.
