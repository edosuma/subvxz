WEBVTT

00:41.876 --> 00:46.836
[door buzzer]

00:56.224 --> 00:57.555
I'm busy.

00:57.642 --> 01:01.635
Seriously? Come on.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.640
We talked about this, Bo.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.518
Last time. I promise.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.691
Please.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.945
Please.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.069
Okay, Bo, that's enough.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.740
That's enough!

02:21.183 --> 02:25.973
Do I even want to know what kind
of trouble you got up to tonight?

02:26.063 --> 02:28.224
Nothing exciting.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.274
Just tracking some guy for a client.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.821
Thought he was alone. He
wasn't. Violence ensued.

02:39.577 --> 02:42.819
At least you're healing a lot faster.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.450
Yeah, thanks.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.328
Been working on that with Lauren.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.789
I bet.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.088
Jesus, Dyson. Leave it already.

02:54.175 --> 02:58.134
She's just leading you on.
She's never going to love you.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.802
Who said anything about love?

03:02.016 --> 03:04.132
And you don't know that.

03:08.064 --> 03:11.477
Bo, I meant what I said.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.855
This was the last time.
For your own good.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.903
You've got to start handling
your healing on your own.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.508
[BO] He is being such a girl.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.965
[KENZI] Why? Because Wolfboy's
tired of you life-sucking him

03:46.060 --> 03:48.802
whenever the mood hits?
You're right, what an asshole.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.854
[BO] It is not like he's not getting
anything out of it, trust me.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.307
[KENZI] Okay, first off, eew. And second,

03:54.402 --> 03:57.735
obviously, you can't have Dyson and
chase after Dr. Hotpants anymore.

03:57.822 --> 04:00.234
Time to pick a team, dude.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.189
[BO] Teams are stupid.

04:05.121 --> 04:08.204
[KENZI] Are you sure this is where
we're supposed to meet this guy?

04:10.626 --> 04:13.038
Yeah, but it'll be a short meeting.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.335
Why?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.208
'Cause that's him.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.047
[KENZI] Ouch.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.462
Yeah, we really need to start hanging
out with a better class of people.

04:26.142 --> 04:29.179
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.012
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.018
My love carries a death sentence.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.225
l was lost for years,

04:37.319 --> 04:40.026
searching, while hiding,

04:40.114 --> 04:44.198
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

04:44.285 --> 04:49.245
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.306
What do you think?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.385
Well, if it's suicide, I think he seriously

05:12.480 --> 05:15.313
should have rethought his last outfit.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.312
--Hey, hey.
--Hey, hey, hey.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.611
Relax. I'm on your side.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.733
Can you call off your human, please?

05:26.827 --> 05:31.241
Sorry. Thought you were
dead. What's with the noose?

05:31.332 --> 05:34.244
Unrelated business disagreement.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.916
"Dead."
[laughing]

05:36.003 --> 05:39.916
As if a little lynching could kill me.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.419
l'm mildly insulted.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.752
| mildly apologize.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.758
So...

05:48.849 --> 05:51.636
what's this information I'm
going to be dying to have?

05:51.727 --> 05:53.968
Ohh.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.858
What if I said I found your mother?

06:02.530 --> 06:05.943
I'd say you better not be
messing with me, Siegfried.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.819
Here.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.659
Is this her?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.992
For 20 blood bags? You wish.

06:18.087 --> 06:21.955
That's as far as I got on the trail.
The rest is up to you.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.505
She's out of my reach.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.672
Lou Ann Heidinger?

06:24.760 --> 06:27.126
C'mon. "Short, fat, and
fangy" here is playing us.

06:27.221 --> 06:27.926
You know her?

06:27.972 --> 06:30.839
Yeah, she's all over the news.
And not only is she on death row,

06:30.933 --> 06:33.140
but she's on the other side
of the border, genius.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.390
Her execution is in, like, three
days. That's very convenient.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.440
I said she had the answers. I didn't
say you had a lot of time to get them.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.159
I like your necklace.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.081
Thank you.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.751
So, do you ever miss
working on normal people?

07:04.842 --> 07:11.088
No offence to my own kind, but
humans are a little pedestrian now.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.263
Once you go Fae, you
never go back, huh?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.261
So I hear.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.597
Speaking of humans...

07:20.691 --> 07:25.435
have you had any success sexually yet?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.861
Still a little scared to
try the whole meal deal.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.861
But there's no rush, right?

07:31.952 --> 07:36.366
Oh, no. No, of course.
You should take your time.

07:36.457 --> 07:43.204
Because I was thinking that taking
things slow on that front would be good.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.788
For everyone.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.590
If they were okay with that.

07:50.512 --> 07:55.723
Devil's advocate--a succubus needs a
healthy sex life in order to be stable.

07:55.809 --> 08:00.098
And, of course, when wounded, you'll
still need to have sex in order to heal.

08:00.189 --> 08:04.728
Yeah. Well, I've kinda got
that covered. Or, I did, anyway.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.936
Oh. Really? With who?

08:10.574 --> 08:14.908
Dyson. I trust him and he's Fae,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.907
so I don't have to worry
about draining him to death.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.159
Everybody wins.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.784
Well, that's good to know.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.750
As your doctor, I would
be more comfortable

08:26.840 --> 08:32.426
with you choosing someone
slightly less well travelled. But...

08:32.513 --> 08:34.299
it's your choice.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.176
[BO] Now Lauren's
acting jealous, I swear.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.477
[KENZI] The three of you
should just get a room already.

08:42.564 --> 08:45.931
Here. I owe about a million
favours for the rush job on these.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.482
Nice work.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.114
This is crazy.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.368
A lead is a lead.
Let's just see where it goes.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.667
Special Agent Krazner and associate.
We're here to conduct a final profile.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.385
No. I don't see you on the list.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.885
Sure you do. It's right...

09:18.976 --> 09:20.762
here.

09:28.402 --> 09:32.020
Okay. Head on in, Agent.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.028
And if you need anything, just call me.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.737
I bet you've never paid for a
single speeding ticket. Bitch.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.007
What do you want?

09:54.094 --> 09:57.552
Well, first off, for the record,
we aren't really cops.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.847
She knows.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.970
She's Fae.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.352
I'm looking for my mother.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.230
l was told that you
might know who she is.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.606
I don't even know who you are.

10:13.697 --> 10:17.406
She sent me to be raised by
humans, if that triggers anything.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.151
You're the Foundling.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.874
I've heard about you, even in here.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.077
Just rumours, though.
Nothing that could help you.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.297
Are you sure you don't know anything?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.248
Believe it or not, I am the last person

10:35.344 --> 10:38.711
that would want to keep
a mother from her child.

10:38.806 --> 10:43.140
Someone's wasting your time.
And you're wasting mine.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.436
Siegfried sends his best.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.354
Never heard of him.

10:54.822 --> 10:58.155
Well, that was rude and anticlimactic.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.492
Something's wrong.

11:02.579 --> 11:06.071
| just don't think Siegfried
would have lied to me like that.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.827
Why, did he find Vampire Jesus?

11:07.918 --> 11:11.911
No, but he knows I'm going to turn right
back around and kick his ass. A lot.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.496
There's easier ways for
him to score blood.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.877
There's something else going on here.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.980
[humming]

11:54.631 --> 11:58.795
I hear you've been sharing
family business with outsiders.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.844
--Bad Vampire.
--No, I swear.

12:01.930 --> 12:06.890
Well, maybe a teensy bit. But a
fella's got to make a living, right?

12:06.977 --> 12:08.933
Oh, don't hurt me.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.678
No talking.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.849
Oh, balls.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.230
Am I interrupting a meal?

12:18.322 --> 12:20.779
Please, don't let me stop you.

12:35.088 --> 12:40.708
How clumsy. You would be a dove
and pick that up for me, would you?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.758
No!

13:03.116 --> 13:08.076
[screaming]

13:25.305 --> 13:26.806
All right, I'm done.

13:26.890 --> 13:31.304
Tell Forensics he's all theirs when they
decide to bless us with their presence.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.605
Is he dead?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.944
What the hell are you
doing in my crime scene?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.484
Just tell me! Is Siegfried dead?

13:41.571 --> 13:43.072
So, you admit knowing him?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.657
He was helping me with something.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.323
--Something what?
--Something personal.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.995
Bo, please don't tell me this
was another tip on your mother.

13:58.714 --> 13:59.920
You don't get to judge me.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.670
You did not spend the last ten years
a raging freak with a body count.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.137
l'm entitled to some damn answers.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.839
Fine. What was this incredible tip?

14:09.933 --> 14:14.267
That I needed to talk to Lou Ann
Heidinger, that woman on death row.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.561
Did you know she's Fae?

14:18.066 --> 14:19.931
She's Dark Fae.

14:20.027 --> 14:24.316
And whenever they're
involved, Bo, you back off.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.146
I hope you're dropping this now.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.482
Well, I would if I got
closure from Siegfried.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.863
But somebody made that impossible.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.784
Get me Heidinger's police file.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.833
If there's nothing helpful
in there, I will drop it.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.835
Promise.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.379
Ask nice.

14:43.467 --> 14:48.632
Pretty please? With Siegfried's
rushed autopsy report on top?

14:48.722 --> 14:53.216
You just used up your last
favour, Bo. Hope it's worth it.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.473
Siegfried didn't go easy.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.152
Someone made an amusement
park out of his pain receptors.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.354
Yeah. There's nothing in
Lou Ann's file that helps me either.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.691
There's no connection
to Siegfried or me.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.913
Okay. So, forensics proved that
Lou Ann drowned her stepkids

15:15.999 --> 15:18.331
and then set the house
on fire to cover it.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.874
Uh huh.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.372
Siegfried wasn't
drowned, by any chance?

15:22.464 --> 15:25.672
Uh uh. Heart cut out.
While he was still alive.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.125
What? Let me see that.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.932
There's no way a human
got close enough for this.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.806
It's got to be some type of Fae.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.936
Why are there no defensive wounds?

15:44.027 --> 15:47.190
The report say anything about
ligature marks, sedatives?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.566
Hang on.

15:49.658 --> 15:54.368
Nope. No restraints, no drugs.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.786
How is that even possible?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.537
You didn't do it.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.617
What are you talking about?

16:04.798 --> 16:08.211
Someone was controlling you.
Someone made you kill those kids.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.008
Lukas, Jacob, and Cody.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.714
They have names.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.768
And why does it matter now?

16:19.855 --> 16:22.312
They are going to execute you
for something that you didn't do.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.061
I meant to you.

16:25.152 --> 16:30.067
Because I still think that
we are connected somehow

16:30.157 --> 16:34.321
and we just need more
time to figure out how.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.198
Maybe we can help each other.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.707
How did things go so wrong for you?

16:45.839 --> 16:49.127
I fell in love with a human.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.965
I knew the rules and I ignored them.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.263
Seems crazy now.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.341
It's not that crazy.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.435
Did he know what you really were?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.979
No. God, no.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.853
And the more I loved him and the boys,

17:07.944 --> 17:12.358
the more I tried to cut myself off
from my clan to protect them.

17:16.411 --> 17:19.403
Guess I didn't do a very good job.

17:22.209 --> 17:26.953
Are you saying the boys were killed
to punish you for choosing humans?

17:27.047 --> 17:30.039
I'd say they did a pretty
good job, wouldn't you?

17:31.801 --> 17:35.009
Listen, l have a friend.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.472
She's connected with the Light Elders.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.468
I can get an audience with
the Ash and plead for help.

17:39.559 --> 17:44.770
He won't let this stand.
I'm going to get you out of here.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.727
Thank you for arranging this.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.073
I know he's not a fan.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.490
Just... j-just...

17:57.577 --> 18:00.159
...try to be respectful and brief.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.533
And don't mention that I'm
helping you with your treatments.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.331
--That's just between us.
--Should I also curtsy?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.204
Would you relax?

18:14.636 --> 18:17.878
[THE ASH] You've been rethinking
your allegiance, perhaps?

18:20.684 --> 18:23.767
It has come to my attention that
a Fae is about to be executed

18:23.853 --> 18:26.344
under human law for a
crime that she didn't commit.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.853
I know of whom you speak.
It's a matter for the Dark Fae.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.354
But they're the ones that betrayed her.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.528
She is not of my clan,
nor under my protection.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.071
To interfere would be madness.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.400
Lesser things have
started wars between us.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.779
So, you would let her rot
in jail for something

18:43.873 --> 18:48.116
that you all know she didn't do
because you're scared to start trouble?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.042
It would be so easy for you to fix this.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.370
You have power in the
human world that--

18:51.464 --> 18:57.460
Perhaps you should have thought of
that before declining to join us.

18:57.554 --> 19:05.552
Child, you mean well. But you toy
with elements you don't understand.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.601
So do you.

19:10.191 --> 19:15.402
Thanks for the advice.
I'll let myself out.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.980
My, still so charming.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.783
Go.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.081
What were you thinking in there?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.750
What was I thinking?
God, you're the human.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.954
How can you work for that jackhole?
He's as bad as the Dark Fae.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.459
Just by the fact that
you're even saying that

19:35.550 --> 19:38.587
proves you have no idea
what you're dealing with. Bo!

19:38.678 --> 19:40.134
This is dangerous.

19:40.221 --> 19:43.179
l have no influence with the Dark.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.006
I can't help you if you get into trouble.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.308
I am not asking you to.

19:52.734 --> 19:56.977
You tell your boss he's not
the only connection I have.

20:21.554 --> 20:25.638
They call this moo shu?
I could make this.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.556
You're the one that eats
here every damn day.

20:27.644 --> 20:28.884
Well, why shouldn't I?

20:28.978 --> 20:34.439
Took me twenty years to get this
seat just the way I like it. Eat.

20:39.239 --> 20:43.983
l have a friend in jail. I need
some help getting her out.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.819
So, you come to me?

20:46.913 --> 20:47.823
I'm flattered.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.745
Well, don't be. You're
the only contact l have

20:49.833 --> 20:51.994
in the Dark Fae and the
human criminal worlds.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.202
Even I'm not so good with death row.

20:56.631 --> 20:57.746
You know?

20:57.841 --> 21:00.674
Sweetheart, you're not
so good with subtlety.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.003
Some advice? Let this one go.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.384
God! Doesn't anyone want
to help this woman?

21:07.475 --> 21:12.390
Sure. I want to climb Everest, but
it may not be so good for my health.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.516
Are you saying the Fae
will physically stop me?

21:14.607 --> 21:21.729
I am saying that Light Fae, Dark Fae,
all of us must respect the one rule.

21:21.823 --> 21:25.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keeping our
existence secret from humans. So?

21:25.785 --> 21:29.949
So, what you're attempting
is too high profile.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.748
All human eyes are on
this woman, this Lou Ann.

21:33.835 --> 21:38.374
She chose humans over her own.
My people objected.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.877
Who wouldn't feel slighted?

21:40.967 --> 21:44.050
So, we made an example of her.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.049
Family business. End of story.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.552
So, it's okay for you to
kill one of your own?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.428
How is that all right with everybody?

21:51.519 --> 21:54.477
Because we exposed nothing.

21:54.564 --> 22:00.400
The humans have someone in jail, the
case is closed, leave it alone already.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.977
That's how things work in our world.

22:02.071 --> 22:07.441
Well, that is exactly why I won't
join your world, Light or Dark.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.071
Not yet.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.574
Look, if you won't help me get her out,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.371
at least help me find
out who put her in.

22:15.877 --> 22:18.289
Who did the real killing?

22:21.216 --> 22:23.377
I'll look into it for you.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.543
You'll hear from me.

22:29.891 --> 22:33.759
Bo, be careful with this.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.390
You've already made some enemies.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.643
Then I'm asking the right questions.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.743
l have had a shit day.

22:56.376 --> 23:00.540
If anyone wants me, I'll be in the
world's longest, hottest bath.

23:00.630 --> 23:06.375
And I will be saving the world
from robot hookers. You're welcome.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.835
[roaring]

24:49.656 --> 24:51.442
Bo?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.949
[BO screaming]

25:02.752 --> 25:05.368
Bo! Bo!

25:10.843 --> 25:13.630
Hey, Fugly! Over here!

25:36.577 --> 25:38.488
I'm not finished yet.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.159
Holy shit!

25:48.881 --> 25:51.167
Smells like fried bitch.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.222
It wasn't an assassination.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.054
At least not one
sanctioned by the Elders.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.645
So, she wasn't coming to kill me?

26:09.736 --> 26:12.398
She was just in my
shower to, what, loofah me?

26:13.656 --> 26:18.696
If that had been an official hit, they
would have sent more than just one.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.744
Your powers are too unknown for them
to risk anything but a major assault.

26:21.831 --> 26:24.664
Isn't there some kind of
general Fae rule about,

26:24.751 --> 26:27.834
I don't know, not knocking
each other off?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.831
Keeping peace between the sides?

26:29.922 --> 26:32.834
But you don't have a side.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.507
That's what we've been trying
to get you to understand.

26:35.595 --> 26:40.680
Why we want you to choose between
Light and Dark, like the rest of us.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.679
You have no protection
if you have no fealty.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.556
So, I have to be owned to be free?

26:45.646 --> 26:49.355
No. Just to stay breathing.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.478
Well, I don't accept that.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.356
Maybe you just never tried hard
enough for something more.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.442
I've tried.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.583
You can stay with me tonight.

27:11.214 --> 27:15.048
You need more healing than
Lauren's little needles can give you.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.423
I needed your help tonight.
Not your pity.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.898
You actually do dishes.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.271
I dunno, I guess I thought
you just sort of "poof."

27:35.363 --> 27:40.232
l have an industrial dishwasher in
the back, that "poof" enough for you?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.112
You're a little too early for a drink.

27:42.203 --> 27:45.491
And probably too late for advice,
but it's what I need.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.578
What's a Morragh?

27:49.669 --> 27:51.785
Why?

27:51.879 --> 27:54.370
Because one just tried to kill me.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.836
Come in back.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.966
Our little succubus is very persistent.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.432
I know you've been helping
her without my permission.

28:11.524 --> 28:15.767
I assume you've been getting close to
her for the good of the Light Fae, yes?

28:15.862 --> 28:18.274
Yes, of course I have.

28:18.364 --> 28:22.983
Good. And now, we can
use that relationship.

28:27.123 --> 28:31.116
The man Bo seeks is called Vex.
He's a favourite of the Dark Fae.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.166
lf Bo kills Vex, the Dark will kill Bo,

28:33.254 --> 28:35.461
and I'm not ready for that
until I know more about her.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.960
Good. How can I help?

28:38.050 --> 28:41.133
l'll negotiate with the
Morrigan to have Vex sent away.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.506
You will keep Bo on a
leash until he's gone.

28:43.598 --> 28:46.465
How? I've tried to reason with her.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.471
She's a succubus. If you
want to keep her alive,

28:49.562 --> 28:52.520
I'm sure you can think of
some way to distract her.

29:01.782 --> 29:05.366
Nice. It's like Antiques
Roadshow in here.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.496
Hey, Lauren has one of
these around her neck.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.994
What is it, some kind of amulet?

29:13.085 --> 29:17.499
Lauren? She's ward of the Ash.
She wears his mark.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.046
Because she works for him?

29:19.133 --> 29:22.421
Fae Elders don't employ humans.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.173
They own them.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.550
In return for their protection.

29:29.268 --> 29:33.181
Oh. Cozy.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.729
She neglected to mention.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.727
Sorry to keep bugging you
with all these questions,

29:37.818 --> 29:40.730
it's just there's so many
different types of Fae.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.654
| wish there was some kind of
book or something to keep track.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.445
I also want a pony.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.256
Kelties. Sprites.

30:03.678 --> 30:06.215
Djieien, Halforn. I haven't heard
of half of these things growing up.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.921
We wouldn't have been
doing our jobs if you had.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.099
There.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.814
The Morragh.

30:15.898 --> 30:21.894
So, tell me something--as a
succubus, what do you feed on?

30:21.988 --> 30:24.195
Nicotine and wishful thinking?

30:25.992 --> 30:30.076
Chi, I guess, or whatever you
want to call the human life force.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.653
Most of us feed on the
humans in some way.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.579
Their blood...

30:34.667 --> 30:38.034
energy, emotion.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.339
It's the nature of Fae.

30:43.426 --> 30:46.668
The Morragh feeds on rage.

30:50.016 --> 30:53.099
You've angered someone and
they sent one of these after you.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.267
Well, what if they send more, or worse?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.640
You're your own weapon.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.768
--A succubus is not without power--
--Look, that is not an option.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.441
I don't like losing control like that.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.315
At a certain point, it's not
about losing control anymore.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.317
It's about taking it.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.651
Until you're there...

31:27.553 --> 31:29.544
The Siracon.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.181
From the old times.

31:34.268 --> 31:38.762
|t'll hurt all Fae and it protects
the bearer from corruption.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.649
Well, whatever it is,
I think it's happy to see me.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.358
What's it made of?

31:52.453 --> 31:53.659
Unicorn horn.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.236
Ha.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.372
Shit, really?

32:01.337 --> 32:02.873
I never know when to believe you.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.794
Probably better that way.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.338
I heard your friend Lou Ann
dropped her appeal.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.049
I thought you might not
want to be alone right now.

32:23.317 --> 32:26.104
Can I ask you something?

32:26.195 --> 32:30.188
You barely know this woman.
Why are you taking this so personally?

32:30.282 --> 32:33.069
Because we both want the same things.

32:34.954 --> 32:38.117
No matter how miserable l was

32:38.207 --> 32:42.200
before you told me that l was Fae,
at least I had hope back then

32:42.294 --> 32:45.878
that I could live a normal
human life one day if I wanted to.

32:45.965 --> 32:49.583
But do you want a normal life?
The picket fence and the kids and--

32:49.677 --> 32:54.717
I want to know that it's my
choice to make. Not theirs.

32:54.807 --> 32:58.425
Lou made her choice and
look at what they did to her.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.226
And if I just let that go, if I
let them get away with it,

33:01.313 --> 33:05.602
then what chance do l have
at living a life of my own?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.936
And who would want to live it with me?

33:13.576 --> 33:16.568
Look, all I know is that whoever
framed her, I'm going to find them--

33:16.662 --> 33:18.277
Wait.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.339
What are you doing?

33:38.434 --> 33:42.643
I don't know yet. Just let me.

34:01.624 --> 34:04.991
--What? What's wrong?
--I don't want to hurt you.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.878
I trust you.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.707
And nobody owns you.

35:17.324 --> 35:21.863
Hey. Sorry. Go back to sleep.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.411
You're leaving.

35:24.498 --> 35:25.704
Why?

35:25.791 --> 35:30.376
I'll be back. |just... I can't let
this Lou Ann situation go.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.044
There's just... something
I've got to take care of.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.750
No. No, you have to stay.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.594
I didn't figure you for clingy.

35:42.141 --> 35:44.598
Hey. What's going on?

35:44.685 --> 35:47.051
Nothing.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.138
Lauren, what?

35:50.232 --> 35:53.599
Just please let this go, Bo.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.230
For me.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.812
Your revenge could start a damn war.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.898
I'm doing what I can, politically.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.984
| just need a few more hours.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.240
Is that why you're here with me?

36:09.335 --> 36:12.077
You're a diversion?

36:12.171 --> 36:14.913
Just hear me out.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.417
We have your best interests at heart.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.499
"We"? Who's "we"?

36:18.594 --> 36:20.050
Bo.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.801
Were you sent here?

36:24.892 --> 36:28.009
--Let me explain.
--Were you sent here?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.094
Yeah.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.850
Look, it's not what you think. Just--

36:31.940 --> 36:36.809
You have no idea what I think,
and less about what I feel,

36:36.904 --> 36:38.769
or you could not have done this to me.

36:38.864 --> 36:42.448
I'm sorry. Goddamn it, Bo,
I'm trying to protect you!

36:42.534 --> 36:44.991
I haven't done anything wrong!

36:51.043 --> 36:56.709
You were in my bed
because he told you to be.

36:56.799 --> 37:00.132
Everything about that is wrong.

37:00.219 --> 37:03.677
This is suicide. Vex is
too strong for you.

37:03.764 --> 37:07.302
Oh, you know his name?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.258
Where is he?

37:11.146 --> 37:12.522
Where are you going?

37:12.606 --> 37:18.067
I'm going to get answers.
lam through playing nice.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.283
Don't forget your dog collar.

37:44.138 --> 37:45.548
This is how you say hello?

37:45.639 --> 37:48.676
I know his name.
Where do | find this Vex?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.223
--Bo.
--You owe me.

37:50.310 --> 37:54.269
I'm calling the debt.
On your blood honour.

37:54.356 --> 37:58.019
This is no favour that I'm doing you.

37:58.110 --> 38:02.353
Here. Here is where you
go if you're crazy enough.

38:02.448 --> 38:07.067
Vex is a favourite of the Dark Elders.
You don't want that trouble.

39:07.763 --> 39:14.475
[VEX] Ladies and gentlemen,
she's classy, she's sassy.

39:14.561 --> 39:19.476
Please welcome to the stage, Bo!

39:19.566 --> 39:21.147
You going to show yourself?

39:21.235 --> 39:25.979
That's right. We haven't
officially met yet, have we?

39:26.073 --> 39:30.783
And here, | feel like old friends.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.281
I've heard a lot about you.

39:33.372 --> 39:39.117
You're a very silly, confused girl
to care so much for the humans.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.453
You see, it's that kind of thinking
that got Lou Ann killed.

39:42.548 --> 39:47.463
Actually, you're what got her killed.
And I'm here to make that right.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.966
Ooh, I've got chills.

39:51.056 --> 39:55.516
How do you intend
to do that, pray tell...

39:55.602 --> 39:59.561
...when you can't even
control your own weapon?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.818
What the balls, man? Are you cheating?

40:10.909 --> 40:13.070
No. Just genetically superior.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.823
[KENZI] Oh, so you are cheating.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.826
I didn't know where else to go.
It's Bo. I made a huge mistake.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.873
--What did you do?
--She knows who framed Lou Ann.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.326
It's a Mesmer named Vex.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.207
He's too strong for her, Dyson.

40:24.298 --> 40:25.834
--Where?
--We think the strip club

40:25.924 --> 40:27.710
on Prospect Road.

40:41.815 --> 40:43.897
Care for a drink?

40:43.984 --> 40:48.353
You know, I think you're the first
person I'm going to enjoy killing.

40:48.447 --> 40:52.110
Well, that's awfully judgmental.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.031
You barely know me.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.734
You cut out Siegfried's heart

40:55.829 --> 40:58.696
and you forced a woman to
drown her own children.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.953
Well, I never said I was perfect, did I?

41:08.383 --> 41:10.294
[laughing]

41:10.385 --> 41:13.877
Uh oh. Puppet cut her strings.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.435
And that one's cheating, by the way.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.729
--I can live with that.
--Careful.

41:24.816 --> 41:29.150
I know things about you.
And about your mother!

41:29.237 --> 41:31.569
Shut your mouth.

41:31.657 --> 41:35.320
Why do you think I took my time
with that chubby little Vampire?

41:35.410 --> 41:40.404
Ohh, he was holding out on you.
But I've got all the goodies now.

41:40.499 --> 41:43.241
Then I suggest you share.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.245
Bo!

41:44.336 --> 41:48.830
No more games. You tell me who
lam, or I will cut it out of you.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.672
You, go!

41:56.682 --> 41:57.967
To be continued then?

41:58.058 --> 41:58.922
I said go!

41:59.017 --> 42:00.427
--[VEX] Whoo hoo hoo!
--What are you doing?

42:00.519 --> 42:01.599
Saving your ass.

42:01.687 --> 42:02.472
Let me go.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.681
--No!
--Let me go!

42:03.772 --> 42:06.013
If you kill him, they won't
stop until you're dead.

42:06.108 --> 42:08.144
I don't care.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.445
I do.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.068
Bo.

42:27.087 --> 42:31.046
He was the only lead
that I had left to her.

42:31.133 --> 42:33.419
He was lying to you, Bo.

42:35.053 --> 42:38.466
| wish I could tell you there was some
grand conspiracy, but there isn't.

42:38.557 --> 42:43.722
Vex, Siegfried, Lou Ann, they didn't
know anything about your mother.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.104
Nobody does.

42:50.068 --> 42:55.028
Somebody knows. Somebody knows!

42:57.743 --> 43:00.359
Let's go home.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.240
Let's go.

43:23.310 --> 43:26.802
[gasping]

43:30.776 --> 43:32.983
We need to talk.
