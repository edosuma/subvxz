00:15.960 --> 00:17.394
It's time for you to go.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.755
Can I have my gun back?

00:19.840 --> 00:20.830
PAOLO: <i>Is that...</i>

00:20.920 --> 00:22.274
FRED: <i>It's one of
the data streams</i>

00:22.360 --> 00:23.635
<i>that Dresden was collecting.</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:25.752

directly from Eros.

Not people.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.314
Building something.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.476

You think this is for real?

00:40.920 --> 00:42.798
I think I got something

is this?

00:46.560 --> 00:48.119
MILLER: <i>Tell me a little bit
more about yourjourney.</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:50.476
Two kilometers long,
half a kilometer wide.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.710
And at the center,

00:51.800 --> 00:53.871

curved back on itself.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.440

00:56.800 --> 00:59.156
Any idea how we can
take out a whole asteroid?

were you expecting
to find this?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.871
I don't know
what I was expecting.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.474
He could be playing you.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.950
Then at least we know
he's willing to play.

- Huh.

all of them were last employed

03:18.960 --> 03:20.838

Yes.

ass off this station by now.

I don't expect you
to understand

04:40.920 --> 04:42.149

04:42.240 --> 04:44.914
Actually,
I understand your Belter bullshit just fine.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.956
Good.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.032
Then you know we need to
do something about this rock.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.270
Yeah, and you put
a bullet in the guy

04:49.360 --> 04:50.430

04:50.560 --> 04:53.314
Yeah, I did.
I killed the mad scientist.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.158
And now we need to kill
his science experiment.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.799
And how do you suppose
we do that?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.436
The Martian quarantine patrols

04:59.520 --> 05:00.510

clear us a lane?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.159
The patrols are gone.

redeploying ships

05:04.160 --> 05:05.560
all over the system

05:05.640 --> 05:07.359
since Earth blew up Deimos.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.950

And it's only a matter of time
before someone lands on it

05:11.800 --> 05:13.075

05:13.160 --> 05:14.310
or gets infected.

have to do with him?

around the docks.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.040
Even if you mine the docks,

05:23.120 --> 05:24.315
if someone wants in
badly enough,

05:24.400 --> 05:25.470
they'll find a way.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.153
That's why we're gonna
use that.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.231
To knock Eros
right into the sun.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.994
Did you just say
you're gonna use the <i>Nauvoo</i>

05:34.080 --> 05:35.150
as a battering ram?

05:35.880 --> 05:36.836
That's well put.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.071
NAOMI: The <i>Nauvoo</i>
is a cathedral.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.592
What do the Mormons
have to say about this plan?

05:43.080 --> 05:44.514
We're commandeering the ship.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.994
You're insane.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.390
And you might be, too,
for listening to this lunatic.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.791
Well, I guess we could just
broadcast everything we know,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.270
and wait for Earth, Mars
and the OPA

05:55.360 --> 05:58.319
to all rally together
and start singing <i>Kumbaya</i>

05:58.400 --> 05:59.800
and do the right thing.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.149
Just hear me out,
all right?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.470
Look.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.076
We're gonna...

06:07.120 --> 06:08.873
We're gonna launch the <i>Nauvoo,</i>
from here, okay?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.952
We're going to shoot her
like a bullet towards Eros,

06:11.040 --> 06:12.269
picking up speed.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.874
Fred's geeks crunched
all the numbers.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.555
Velocity, speed, angle,
all that crap.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.915
So when she hits...

06:19.760 --> 06:21.194
Eros is on her merry way.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.557
We're gonna detonate
the bombs after impact.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.235
Controlled explosion that
just destroys the docks

06:28.320 --> 06:29.515
and cooks the surface.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.959
Nobody ever gets
in there again.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.000
There's got to be
a better way.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.994
Screw it.
Why don't we just pack

06:41.080 --> 06:42.480
every bomb we have
onto the surface

06:42.560 --> 06:44.233
and detonate them
all at once?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.152
Vaporize the whole
damn station.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.919
MILLER: We'd turn one big
infected rock

06:48.000 --> 06:48.990
into a million tiny ones.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.560
And if one of them rocks falls
down a gravity well...

06:50.680 --> 06:52.672
Cortazar said
the protomolecule

06:52.760 --> 06:54.831
was building
something inside Eros.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.909
What if it's a weapon?

06:58.080 --> 07:00.959
MILLER: We need a gunship
to deliver the bombs

07:01.040 --> 07:04.397
and to provide cover in case
we run into any hostiles.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.431
We need the <i>Roci.</i>

07:08.520 --> 07:09.749
And her crew.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.479
This is gonna destroy you.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.590
Along with everything
you've tried to build here.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.278
Somebody's got to act.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.192
It's the right thing to do.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.111
Stars are better off
without us.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.554
All right. We're in.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.477
I believe in always
clearing up misunderstandings

08:26.600 --> 08:27.670
eye-to-eye.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.070
Good.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.835
So, you had no knowledge
of the money being funneled

08:32.240 --> 08:35.916
from Protogen to build a fleet
of secret stealth ships?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.153
Of course not, Madam.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.595
Mao-Kwikowski has hundreds
of satellite companies

08:41.679 --> 08:43.433
under its umbrella.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.115
Protogen represents
less than

08:46.200 --> 08:47.919
a third of one percent
of our revenue.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.515
We all know that Fred Johnson
still has ties to Earth,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.160
but you need
to explain to us

08:53.240 --> 08:54.640
how the OPA could
infiltrate your company.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.749
We do business in every part
of the system.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.792
So naturally we're going
to be a target

09:00.080 --> 09:01.434
for corporate espionage

09:01.600 --> 09:02.920
and political radicals.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.271
So, you believe the stealth
ships are the work of...

09:06.680 --> 09:07.750
OPA moles?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.117
That's the theory that our
security team is operating under.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.396
These moles are still
your employees

09:13.480 --> 09:14.516
whom you hired

09:14.600 --> 09:17.195
and vetted through
your security screenings.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.151
Day-to-day operations
are handled by

09:20.240 --> 09:22.755
Protogen executives,
with full autonomy.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.517
With such a small project,
my team would only be notified

09:26.600 --> 09:29.115
if the company exceeded
its budget allotment.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.876
So, these rogue employees
managed to make a profit

09:32.960 --> 09:35.998
and a war without even
going over budget?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.120
God, maybe we should get
these people on our payroll.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.311
Protogen is a biotech
research company,

09:46.520 --> 09:49.160
and it had a government
contract on Phoebe Station.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.949
Is that correct?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.713
I'm sorry, Chrisjen.
How is this relevant

09:52.880 --> 09:54.633
to the stealth ships?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.792
The Martians seemed very
intent on destroying Phoebe

09:57.880 --> 09:59.997
before the <i>Nathan Hale</i>
could secure it.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.320
I just wanted to know what
Protogen was working on there.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.313
JULES-PIERRE: I'll check
into that for you.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.149
But if this was
a government contract,

10:10.280 --> 10:11.600
I'm sure that you would
have full access

10:11.680 --> 10:12.670
to those same records.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.116
And here I thought you
came in to clear up

10:15.200 --> 10:16.714
any misunderstandings.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.916
We're being polite,
<i>Monsieur</i> Mao,

10:21.120 --> 10:24.557
but the Deputy Secretary and
I are trying to stop a war.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.157
The fact is,
these stealth ships

10:27.360 --> 10:29.352
were built by your company,

10:29.520 --> 10:30.920
under your watch.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.709
And the people of Earth

10:32.800 --> 10:35.679
will hold you
personally responsible

10:35.800 --> 10:38.315
when the first rock
falls from the sky.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.031
SADAVIR: I'm sure <i>Monsieur</i> Mao
will personally see that Protogen

10:42.560 --> 10:45.155
helps the UN investigation
with complete transparency

10:45.400 --> 10:47.039
before any more
tragedy occurs.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.430
Isn't that right?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.157
Of course, Deputy Secretary.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.390
I only want what's in the
best interests of the system.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.430
Good.
