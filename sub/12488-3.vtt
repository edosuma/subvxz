WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.336
- Ace McFumbles here.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.088
It's our first game
of the season

00:05.171 --> 00:06.923
and our Bulldogs
will face off against

00:07.006 --> 00:08.007
the number one ranked
Wentworth Rangers.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.386
Even worse--Wentworth has
a new offensive weapon--

00:11.469 --> 00:13.930
former Bulldogs star,
Troy Dixon.

00:14.013 --> 00:16.099
You may know him
by his other names--

00:16.181 --> 00:18.518
"Traitor," "Jerk,"
"Butt Face."

00:18.601 --> 00:20.270
But that ends today.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.064
From now on, Troy Dixon
will only be known as...

00:23.148 --> 00:25.942
"He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named."

00:26.025 --> 00:27.777
What's that, Chauncy?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.112
Voldemort?

00:29.195 --> 00:31.239
Hmph, never heard of him.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.243
- Wow, Ace is not
going easy on Troy.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.870
- Shhh! Don't say his name.

00:36.953 --> 00:37.620
- Newt, don't listen to Ace.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.248
Troy is still our boy.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.374
- I know, but I like rules.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.084
Some people think it's good
to question authority,

00:43.168 --> 00:46.379
but I find comfort
in blind obedience.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.717
- So, Rangers,
this is the Starcade.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.968
My home away from home.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.386
They even have a pizza
named after me.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.305
Check it.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.806
Excuse me, can I get
two Troy Dixons

00:56.890 --> 00:58.475
with all the fixin's?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.977
- I'm sorry, we renamed it
when we took down your jersey.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.021
It's now called
"The Traitor."

01:03.104 --> 01:05.147
You want that with
all the fixin's?

01:05.230 --> 01:07.859
- I'll just take a salad.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.360
- [laughing]
Traitor.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.154
Hey, guys, I think
we found a nickname

01:11.237 --> 01:11.654
for What's-His-Face.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.906
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.159
I kinda like
What's-His-Face better.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.203
- RANGERS: [laughing]

01:18.286 --> 01:20.955
- Troy!
- Hey, Bella!

01:21.039 --> 01:22.832
- This is, uh,
this is my Wentworth group.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.875
- What's up? I'm Taylor.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.336
- This is our team
captain, Logan.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.087
- Hey. We've heard
a lot about you.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.923
This guy here seems
impressed with your arm.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.508
- Aw, thanks, Troy.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.343
- But he's also impressed
with this dump,

01:33.426 --> 01:35.303
so I'm not sure
if I should believe him.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.722
- Hey, don't call
this place a dump.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.350
My parents got
married here.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.352
- Yeah, and it's not like
you guys should talk.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.062
You think you're all
fancy in those uniforms.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.606
Well, I can't tell if
you're a football team

01:46.689 --> 01:50.026
or an a cappella group.
- OTHERS: Ooohhh...

01:50.109 --> 01:52.028
- Go, Bella. Bring it home.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.322
- I already did.
[laughs]

01:54.405 --> 01:55.865
That was the whole put-down.
- Right.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.034
That's right. We're home.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.411
Take yer shoes off
in my house, sucka!

02:00.495 --> 02:02.872
The 'hood.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.708
- Okay. Let's eat.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.961
- So...how are you guys?

02:09.044 --> 02:11.005
- Great. Just getting ready for
the big game against you.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.049
- Oh, man, it's
gonna be so weird

02:13.132 --> 02:14.551
playing against each other.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.928
What if I slap ya on the butt
when I'm supposed to tackle you?

02:17.011 --> 02:20.348
Or tackle you when I'm supposed
to slap you on the butt?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.475
- Just don't slap
me on the butt.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.269
Ever.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.438
- Look, Troy, I know everyone's
having a good time

02:27.522 --> 02:29.399
calling you a traitor
and saying you deserted us.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.569
But you know you're always
welcome around here, right?

02:32.652 --> 02:33.945
- Yeah, there's always
a seat at our booth for you.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.739
- Thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.908
But I'm a Wentworth man now.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.076
You can fill that seat.

02:40.159 --> 02:43.329
I've got a new one
right over here.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.914
I'll just pull
up a chair.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.585
- Oh, thanks. It's gettin'
a little cozy in there.

02:48.668 --> 02:53.965
- Right. I'll, just,
uh, lean here.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.552

ordered the raspberry smoo--

03:34.881 --> 03:36.466
{\an8}Aw, come on.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.259
{\an8}- Aw, Troy, did you just
buy a bunch of smoothies

03:38.343 --> 03:40.970
{\an8}for the team and they
left without you?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.056
{\an8}- No, these are for me,
all right?

03:43.139 --> 03:44.933
{\an8}I'm bulkin' up.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.601
{\an8}I just started!

03:46.684 --> 03:49.812
{\an8}And they didn't just leave.
They left a note.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
{\an8}- That's the check.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.942
{\an8}- Aw, come on!

03:54.025 --> 03:55.777
{\an8}Okay, fine.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.279
I've been havin' a tough
time fitting in at Wentworth.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.156
And that's never
happened before.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.033
All my life, people have
just fit in with me.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.327
- Troy, don't worry.
You're just new.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.496
You guys didn't accept
me at first either.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.997
But if a girl can fit
in on a boys' team,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.667
you can fit in
at Wentworth.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.793
- Yeah, I hope so.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.253
Bein' a girl is hard.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.463
- Truth, sista.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.298
- Who you callin' sista?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.216
- Look, Troy,
just give it some time

04:19.300 --> 04:20.343
and go with the flow.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.136
You'll fit in sooner
than you think.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.388
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.931
- [cell phone buzzing]

04:25.014 --> 04:26.975
- Oh, it's Logan.
[sighing]

04:27.058 --> 04:27.976
The team bus left
without me.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.520
Now I gotta walk home.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.065
With me luck crossin'
the highway.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.192
- Did he leave?
- Yeah.

04:36.275 --> 04:39.862
- You know he didn't
pay, right?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.531
- I do now.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.744
- Pepper, my schedule.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.871
- Uh, you have an interview
with Coach at 4:00.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.541
Then one with the captain of
the basketball team at 5:00.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.876
Then shoe shopping with
your mother at 6:00.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.131
- I keep telling her I don't
have the feet for flip-flops.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.550
- Pepper, are you
working for Ace?

05:00.633 --> 05:03.469
- If you mean in the traditional
sense--like for money?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.054
No, but if you mean
putting in

05:05.138 --> 05:06.848
more than 40 hours
a week for free--

05:06.931 --> 05:08.766
then, yes, I'm working.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.310
- Why would you do that?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.145
- It's the only way
I can get my own show

05:12.228 --> 05:13.646
on the school TV station.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.898
- Since when do you care so much
about being on TV, anyway?

05:15.982 --> 05:18.067
- Since I had this amazing
idea for a show--

05:18.151 --> 05:19.652
"Silverado Scoop."

05:19.736 --> 05:21.404
- Ooh, it's an ice cream show.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.989
- No, it's a gossip show.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.074
- Oh. I kinda like
the ice cream show better.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.161
- It was never
an ice cream show.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.288
Anyway, Ace doesn't think
I'm camera-ready,

05:30.371 --> 05:33.082
so I'm interning for him
to learn how TV works.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.834
- So, why are you
answering his phone

05:34.917 --> 05:36.544
and getting him coffee?

05:36.627 --> 05:38.171
- Apparently,
that's how TV works.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.757
- It sounds like
he's using you.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.633
Pepper, you need
to stand up for yourself.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.968
If you wanna make
an ice cream show,

05:44.052 --> 05:45.428
make an ice cream show.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.432
- Again--not an ice
cream show.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.976
But maybe you're right.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.395
Okay, I'm gonna tell him
I've interned enough

05:54.479 --> 05:55.646
and now I want
my own show.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.607
- Good for you.
- Pepper!

05:57.690 --> 05:58.775
[coughing]

05:58.858 --> 06:00.443
Get me some herbal
tea for my throat.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.111
I think I'm coming
down with something.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.072
- Got it, boss.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.115
Don't judge me.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.289
- Well, kids, seeing
players come and go

06:13.372 --> 06:14.874
is part of being
on a team.

06:14.957 --> 06:20.004
The key is never lettin'
it get to you.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.966
Oh, God...
[whimpering]

06:24.050 --> 06:26.094
- It's gonna be a while
before we get over this.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.012
- Yeah.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.058
- Why are you trying to put
your stuff in Troy's locker?

06:32.141 --> 06:34.227
{\an5}- Why are you trying to put
your stuff in Troy's locker?

06:34.310 --> 06:35.728
- Seriously, guys?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.896
He hasn't even been
gone a week.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.314
- You're right.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.109
- We really need to
respect his memory.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.861
- Newt!
- What?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.655
I need this space
to store my sweaters.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.740
- Just shove 'em in
the top of your locker.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.158
- Seriously?

06:49.242 --> 06:53.079
You do not shove cashmere.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.414
- Somebody likes
their sweaters.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.587
- Okay, all in favor of

07:01.671 --> 07:03.256
never eating at the Starcade
again raise your hand.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.008
- You guys having
a team meeting?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.552
- Yeah, we are.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.470
You can, uh,
come in in a minute.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.596
- Okay, but this
is my room.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.474
- Okay, all in favor of
Troy coming into his room.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.687
- Seriously, bro?

07:19.522 --> 07:23.109
- So, our final order of
business is the team prank.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.569
Right now, the plan is
to head down to their field

07:24.652 --> 07:28.948
and replace the Bulldogs'
banner with a Rangers' banner.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.284
- TROY: What?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.326
- You got a problem
with that?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.579
Don't want us to
prank your friends?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.581
- No, I wanna prank
them better than that.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.748
I mean, a banner?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.709
Come on, man,
that's amateur hour.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.210
- What?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.588
It took me most of yesterday
just to roll this thing up.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.299
- Hang on, Taylor,
let's just hear him out.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.717
Go ahead.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.552
- Okay, look, if you wanna
pull an impre--

07:49.635 --> 07:52.555
- [paper crackling]

07:52.638 --> 07:54.807
- If you real--
- [paper crackling]

07:58.811 --> 08:00.563
- If you wanna pull
an impressive prank,

08:00.646 --> 08:02.732
you should toilet paper
the Bulldogs' locker room--

08:02.815 --> 08:04.400
which, I can get you into.

08:04.483 --> 08:05.943
- And you'd do that
to your old team?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.571
- No, but I'd do it
for my new team.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.239
- Maybe you are
Wentworth material.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.659
Hey, Taylor, move over.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.244
Let Troy sit here.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.788
- Wait, so who's gonna pay me
back for this butcher paper?

08:20.499 --> 08:21.584
- Okay, tell us
how it's done.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.586
- Well, first of all,
not many people know that TP,

08:23.669 --> 08:26.339
or "Toilet Paper"
is derived from the French

08:26.422 --> 08:30.801
"toilette papier" which--
- Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

08:30.885 --> 08:32.428
Just give us the plan.
- Right. Right.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.929
Okay, so, here's
