WEBVTT

00:55.064 --> 00:58.232
Uh-huh.

00:58.234 --> 00:59.802
All right, sweetie.

01:00.669 --> 01:03.170
Yeah, have a good night.

01:03.172 --> 01:04.572
See ya tomorrow.

02:06.534 --> 02:07.370
Willie?

03:50.172 --> 03:53.075
Willie.

04:10.926 --> 04:13.929
Oh, my god!

04:50.366 --> 04:55.371
Who in God's
name's messing with me?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.209
God, work.

05:35.878 --> 05:36.944
Stupid.

05:36.946 --> 05:37.780
No.

06:14.682 --> 06:15.584
We can hear her.

06:16.986 --> 06:19.086
At night, we can
hear her upstairs.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.456
Far bedroom to the right.

06:21.624 --> 06:24.224
She used to spend her
time in there, sewing.

06:25.727 --> 06:27.963
She used to say it helped
keep her mentally alive.

06:29.664 --> 06:31.398
I understand that,
in these times,

06:31.400 --> 06:33.269
sometimes all you
wanna do is forget.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.805
And with your fiancÃ©
not being able to pass,

06:37.973 --> 06:39.940
it must really put
a weight on you.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.743
I just wanna move
on with my life.

06:44.013 --> 06:44.847
I'll help you.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.281
May I go upstairs?

06:47.283 --> 06:48.117
Please.

06:49.351 --> 06:50.953
Are you sure you
don't want me filming?

06:51.987 --> 06:52.821
I'll be fine.

06:54.023 --> 06:55.556
I can get it.

06:55.558 --> 06:57.591
Stay downstairs
and look after Ben.

06:57.593 --> 06:58.427
Sure.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.436
We're about to enter
the affected space.

07:42.438 --> 07:46.575
Just to recap for you guys,
Carla Johnson died in 2013.

07:47.977 --> 07:50.177
And ever since her
death, her fiancÃ©, Ben,

07:50.179 --> 07:52.081
has felt her presence
through this room.

08:22.678 --> 08:24.845
Carla Johnson.

08:24.847 --> 08:28.517
If you are here, please,
come and be present.

09:12.227 --> 09:14.330
Your fiancÃ© is trying to
move on with his life.

09:15.998 --> 09:19.501
It's not that you'll be
forgotten, 'cause you won't.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.211
Is that a sign?

09:55.170 --> 09:57.839
I'm here to help
you both move on.

09:57.841 --> 09:58.674
To let go.

11:10.245 --> 11:11.079
Jesus Christ.

11:13.817 --> 11:14.784
You ruined my shot.

11:15.984 --> 11:17.617
Kat, I told you to
wait downstairs.

11:17.619 --> 11:19.521
Reece, I think I caught her.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.858
I wanted to release her.

11:54.723 --> 11:57.892
I've been calling
you for half an hour.

11:57.894 --> 11:58.795
You didn't hear me?

12:02.331 --> 12:03.131
Kat.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.067
I said if my hearing went
again, I'd say, okay?

12:07.069 --> 12:10.704
It's not worth it if you're
having side-effects, Reece.

12:10.706 --> 12:13.776
What if one day your
hearing doesn't come back?

12:15.110 --> 12:17.579
I can't do this without
you, we're a team.

12:24.553 --> 12:26.219
I just wanna help
people, before...

12:26.221 --> 12:27.055
I get it.

12:28.423 --> 12:30.225
I just worry about
you is all, okay?

12:37.366 --> 12:38.200
Thank you.

12:39.401 --> 12:41.136
I appreciate it, I really do.

12:50.045 --> 12:51.113
Don't shut me out.

13:02.859 --> 13:05.193
I'm sorry, for any...

13:06.328 --> 13:08.530
I understand, your gift.

13:09.866 --> 13:11.832
I see what it does for people.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.733
And so do our followers.

13:13.735 --> 13:16.705
2,000 likes on the Carla
Johnson case already.

13:24.246 --> 13:25.247
We are a team.

13:34.456 --> 13:38.627
There are also a few
fans who wanted to do this.

15:17.827 --> 15:19.292
Hello.

15:19.294 --> 15:22.362
I'm sorry
it's late, I just,

15:22.364 --> 15:24.197
didn't know what else to do.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.565
Who is this?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.200
Sorry.

15:27.202 --> 15:28.104
Ruth O'Neil.

15:29.005 --> 15:30.372
I found you online.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.673
You speak to the dead.

15:33.675 --> 15:37.243
I can speak to those that
have trouble passing, yes.

15:37.245 --> 15:40.580
Something
is inside my house,

15:40.582 --> 15:43.984
but I'm not sure
if it's a spirit,

15:43.986 --> 15:48.055
or something else.

15:48.057 --> 15:51.393
Okay, may I ask
what's been happening?

15:54.596 --> 15:59.466
I can,
I can hear her.

15:59.468 --> 16:01.369
I see her, in my house.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.041
The Candywitch.

16:06.475 --> 16:09.242
And you can physically
see her in your house?

16:09.244 --> 16:12.614
I need help, I
didn't know who else to call.

16:14.716 --> 16:17.820
You see, I feel like a
prisoner in my own home.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.520
Do you understand?

16:20.522 --> 16:22.524
I understand too
well what you mean.

16:23.391 --> 16:25.260
I just want it to stop.

16:26.428 --> 16:30.030
I just want peace in
my life once more.

16:30.032 --> 16:30.867
I can't...

16:32.168 --> 16:34.436
I can't live a normal life.

16:35.337 --> 16:36.172
Please.

16:37.339 --> 16:39.674
Please, say you can help me.

16:52.188 --> 16:53.588
The Candywitch?

17:06.868 --> 17:08.434
That's her picture.

17:08.435 --> 17:10.805
Papers want you to believe
she's dead and gone.

17:10.807 --> 17:12.272
Don't trust them.

17:12.275 --> 17:15.742
You see her, you make
sure you hide your kids.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.179
She uses candy canes, people!

17:18.181 --> 17:19.182
Candy canes!

17:44.273 --> 17:46.909
Why does it matter
who believes in your gift?

17:48.144 --> 17:49.609
What do you mean?

17:49.611 --> 17:53.214
Well, the people who knew
your father, they knew his gift.

17:53.216 --> 17:55.883
What does it matter
what they say online?

17:55.885 --> 17:58.052
Reece, you gotta stop filling
your head with this stuff.

17:58.054 --> 17:58.888
Okay?

18:00.422 --> 18:02.024
I just hate seeing it online.

18:03.192 --> 18:04.124
He had a gift and he...

18:04.126 --> 18:06.659
And that gift killed him.

18:06.661 --> 18:08.965
And he wouldn't want it
to do the same to you.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.069
Stop doing this to yourself.

18:15.370 --> 18:16.404
Someone called.

18:17.539 --> 18:18.573
At this time?

18:20.309 --> 18:22.544
An old lady, her name's Ruth.

18:23.946 --> 18:26.180
Says she feels like a
prisoner in her own home.

18:26.182 --> 18:27.984
Struggling to move
on with her life.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.885
Right?

18:30.887 --> 18:32.820
Says the Candywitch
haunts her.

18:32.822 --> 18:34.788
The Candywitch?

18:34.790 --> 18:36.790
Sounds fun?

18:36.792 --> 18:37.759
A child murderer.

18:39.061 --> 18:40.830
What time do we leave?

18:56.444 --> 18:57.280
Tina?

19:05.888 --> 19:06.789
Tina?

19:13.528 --> 19:14.496
Tina?

19:26.976 --> 19:27.810
Tina, honey.

19:28.844 --> 19:30.445
It's time to go inside.

24:05.753 --> 24:07.823
Sure you wanna do this?

24:08.691 --> 24:10.290
Yeah, I'm sure.

24:10.292 --> 24:11.191
You?

24:11.193 --> 24:12.725
Absolutely.

24:12.727 --> 24:14.129
You ready for your close-up?

24:15.864 --> 24:16.865
Let's get going.

24:27.910 --> 24:29.343
Welcome to the mad house.

24:29.345 --> 24:31.247
Come on in, Ruth's
been expecting you.

24:37.820 --> 24:38.921
You're early.

24:42.958 --> 24:43.792
Hi, Ruth?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.861
Lovely to meet you and
thank you for coming.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.963
You have brought a guest?

24:49.965 --> 24:51.698
This is my girlfriend, Kat.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.368
She's gonna be documenting
this experience.

24:54.370 --> 24:58.005
Well, if that's
what's required, sure.

24:58.007 --> 25:00.474
We have a bedroom, but
it's a small double.

25:00.476 --> 25:02.976
Oh, no worries,
we'll make it work.

25:02.978 --> 25:06.246
- Hi, I'm Kat, nice to meet you.
- You too, darling.

25:06.248 --> 25:08.949
Okay, let me show
you in the house,

25:08.951 --> 25:10.953
and introduce you to the family.

25:20.996 --> 25:21.830
Come on in.

25:23.532 --> 25:26.235
- You have a beautiful house.
- Thank you.

25:34.710 --> 25:35.976
I didn't realize
you had a family.

25:35.978 --> 25:37.144
I thought you lived alone.

25:37.146 --> 25:38.645
No.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.315
Last week, my family
were away on travels,

25:41.317 --> 25:42.849
and I was on my own.

25:42.851 --> 25:46.687
That's when the incidents
heightened, when I was alone.

25:46.689 --> 25:48.357
Come meet my husband.

25:53.797 --> 25:54.630
Hi.

25:56.165 --> 25:58.098
- Hi.
- You must be Reece.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.333
I heard a lot about you.

25:59.335 --> 26:02.636
And thank you for coming
on such short notice.

26:02.638 --> 26:05.305
I'm Willie, Ruth's
long sufferin'.

26:05.307 --> 26:08.310
Of course, pleasure
to meet you, Willie.

26:09.411 --> 26:10.477
Tom?

26:10.479 --> 26:11.513
Tom, come in here.

26:12.681 --> 26:15.082
Tom's our son, he's
just in from college.

26:15.084 --> 26:16.917
- This is Reece.
- Nice to meet you.

26:16.919 --> 26:20.020
I've seen some of you guys'
stuff online, it's cool.

26:20.022 --> 26:20.856
Thanks.

26:22.024 --> 26:23.690
Is there anyone else
that lives here?

26:23.692 --> 26:25.692
My daughter, Lea, uh, Leanne.

26:25.694 --> 26:26.895
She's up in her bedroom.

26:27.963 --> 26:28.798
Okay.

26:29.698 --> 26:30.532
Coffee?

26:35.471 --> 26:37.106
It started late last year.

26:39.174 --> 26:42.709
Just before Christmas, I
was alone in the house,

26:42.711 --> 26:45.178
and I could hear this laughing.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.983
I couldn't figure out where
it was coming from at first.

26:49.184 --> 26:52.921
I thought it might
be Lea, but nothing.

26:54.089 --> 26:55.290
There was no one there.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.760
And I looked everywhere,
turning the place upside-down,

26:59.762 --> 27:01.730
but nothing, no one.

27:03.232 --> 27:07.267
Then the occurrences became,

27:07.269 --> 27:08.237
stronger.

27:10.973 --> 27:13.475
I could feel her around me.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.613
I wouldn't see her at
first, that came later.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.349
But when I did see her?

27:22.217 --> 27:25.285
That's when it all heightened.

27:25.287 --> 27:27.122
Everything became worse.

27:29.224 --> 27:30.325
I saw her.

27:34.062 --> 27:35.996
The Candywitch.

27:35.998 --> 27:41.003
A satanist, in my house.

27:41.838 --> 27:43.136
When you say "Candywitch,"

27:43.138 --> 27:44.973
you mean Jennifer
Harper, don't you?

27:46.208 --> 27:47.042
Yes.

27:58.353 --> 27:59.721
What are you doing?

28:00.689 --> 28:02.122
Sorry.

28:02.124 --> 28:03.623
Kat, nice to meet you.

28:03.625 --> 28:06.428
- I came here today with the...
- Paranormal investigator?

28:10.532 --> 28:13.400
What relevance does
she have with this house?

28:13.402 --> 28:16.871
Usually, a spirit has
some kind of attachment

28:16.873 --> 28:18.974
to either a home, or a resident.

28:22.044 --> 28:25.681
We found markings on
the children one evening.

28:27.549 --> 28:31.019
I was bathing Lea, and I found,

28:32.221 --> 28:35.224
on her legs, these marks.

28:37.159 --> 28:39.659
Of course, first thing
I do is check Tom

28:39.661 --> 28:44.066
for similar markings, and he
has them, across his back.

28:47.302 --> 28:49.238
She'd been whipping
the children.

28:50.172 --> 28:51.006
Hurting them.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.376
Scolding them for
god-knows what reason.

28:56.478 --> 28:59.145
When we confronted the children,

28:59.147 --> 29:01.116
they denied she'd
done these things.

29:02.217 --> 29:03.483
They were young.

29:03.485 --> 29:05.521
They didn't want to get
her in trouble, you see?

29:07.222 --> 29:12.125
When we found out, we
expelled her from the house.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.829
And the town's
children began vanishing?

29:16.933 --> 29:18.267
Old wives tales.

29:19.468 --> 29:21.768
Nothing was ever confirmed.

29:21.770 --> 29:25.038
But, if it walks like a duck.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.439
Don't mind him.

29:26.441 --> 29:29.576
- Keith, this is Kat.
- We met briefly downstairs.

29:29.578 --> 29:30.778
We sure did.

29:30.780 --> 29:34.414
The Ghostbusters
are here.

29:34.416 --> 29:37.952
Mom is totally wasting
her money on this, right?

29:37.954 --> 29:41.521
The gift Reece has, it's real.

29:41.523 --> 29:45.193
So, he what, speaks
to dead people?

29:46.094 --> 29:47.929
Oh, god, do his eyes roll back

29:47.931 --> 29:50.597
when he connects to the
spirit world?

29:50.599 --> 29:53.700
He can see them and
we help them move on.

29:53.702 --> 29:55.637
Using their energy,
he can help them.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.173
What's that you
got in your hand?

30:00.175 --> 30:01.176
An EMF reader.

30:02.744 --> 30:04.411
And that is?

30:04.413 --> 30:07.882
It's a way of measuring
ambient electromagnetic fields.

30:07.884 --> 30:10.820
It tells us when something from
the other side is close by.

30:12.087 --> 30:13.988
Oh, cool!

30:13.990 --> 30:17.357
So you bring props into this
studio production of yours too.

30:17.359 --> 30:19.194
I bet your Insta
followers love that.

30:22.999 --> 30:23.833
You knew her?

30:29.171 --> 30:30.938
She was our nanny.

30:33.910 --> 30:34.777
She did that?

30:36.578 --> 30:39.814
I don't remember, we were
kids when she did it to us.

30:39.816 --> 30:40.950
You and your brother?

30:42.250 --> 30:44.451
She would lose
her temper with us.

30:44.453 --> 30:47.021
Scold us when our
parents were out.

30:47.023 --> 30:47.924
I'm so sorry.

30:49.591 --> 30:51.861
Locals call her
the Candywitch.

30:53.261 --> 30:55.464
She used to hand candy canes
out to the little kids.

30:56.632 --> 30:58.600
Have you seen
her, the Candywitch?

30:59.936 --> 31:02.270
I bet you're dying for
me to say yeah, right?

31:03.472 --> 31:05.739
Your mom asked us to help her.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.743
We're here for her, and for you.

31:09.112 --> 31:11.647
It's not nice to feel you
can't breathe in your own home.

31:27.195 --> 31:29.329
It looks like your ghost
doesn't wanna be found.

31:35.470 --> 31:37.606
Last night, a neighbor.

31:38.774 --> 31:40.742
I suppose you saw
the police tape.

31:42.711 --> 31:45.412
Boiled alive, they say.

31:45.414 --> 31:46.916
In melting chocolate.

31:48.750 --> 31:49.618
It's her.

31:50.787 --> 31:53.788
The Candywitch, she's back.

31:53.790 --> 31:58.391
Sometimes, a spirit, it
can just be that of a host.

31:58.393 --> 31:59.594
Something we remember.

32:00.997 --> 32:03.898
And those memories can be
manipulated by an energy so evil

32:03.900 --> 32:07.767
that sometimes it can trick
a victim into believing

32:07.769 --> 32:09.671
it's the memories of
someone they knew.

32:10.672 --> 32:12.641
Do you believe in evil?

32:14.911 --> 32:15.912
Well, I do.

32:17.013 --> 32:19.347
And that's what that lady was.

32:21.984 --> 32:24.350
You have to help me, Reece.

32:24.352 --> 32:27.723
You have to help me get rid
of her, once and for all.

32:30.225 --> 32:31.060
Please.

32:53.348 --> 32:56.016
It's gonna
be all right, son.

32:56.018 --> 32:57.252
You understand?

33:00.223 --> 33:02.925
None of us have
slept in weeks.

33:04.392 --> 33:07.763
If this doesn't work,
you have to do something.

33:17.672 --> 33:20.775
My mind just keeps
replaying what she did,

33:20.777 --> 33:22.310
over and over again in my head.

33:23.946 --> 33:25.014
Can we just move out?

33:27.884 --> 33:31.351
This house has been in
my family for generations.

33:31.353 --> 33:33.653
I'm not gonna give that up.

33:33.655 --> 33:34.756
If she's here,

33:36.458 --> 33:39.759
if she wants this house, she's
gonna have to go through me.

33:39.761 --> 33:40.629
You understand?

33:41.964 --> 33:43.964
I'm gonna take a bath.

33:43.966 --> 33:45.367
Tiffany's coming over later.

33:47.769 --> 33:48.570
Tiffany!

33:50.639 --> 33:52.273
You check with your mother.

33:52.275 --> 33:55.109
You know she doesn't want
that girl in this house.

33:55.111 --> 33:56.378
I live here too, Dad.

34:27.576 --> 34:29.078
Something's definitely here.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.581
Of that, I'm sure.

34:35.885 --> 34:37.550
Hey, come on,
let's go into town.

34:37.552 --> 34:39.452
There's someone I
think we should meet.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.987
Who?

34:40.989 --> 34:42.487
Well, I did some research,
and this lady, Miss Carmel,

34:42.489 --> 34:45.159
has some really strong
opinions on what happened.

34:45.161 --> 34:46.927
I think she's worth
taking a look,

34:46.929 --> 34:48.630
and she's happy
to be filmed, too.

34:50.632 --> 34:54.667
You go, I need to
feel this energy out.

34:54.668 --> 34:55.835
You sure?

34:55.838 --> 34:57.503
Yeah, just go.

34:57.505 --> 34:58.341
Okay.

35:26.668 --> 35:27.935
Don't go!

35:27.937 --> 35:30.271
Your family have
lost their mind, Lea.

35:30.273 --> 35:32.339
Ghost hunters running
around, come on!

35:32.341 --> 35:35.276
Yeah, I get that, but you
were meant to be here for me.

35:35.278 --> 35:37.577
I am here for you, but,

35:37.579 --> 35:39.980
it's college break
and I need to unwind.

35:39.982 --> 35:41.248
And I need a stress-free time,

35:41.250 --> 35:43.449
before I go back next
semester, all right?

35:43.451 --> 35:45.752
Look, come to the mess party.

35:45.754 --> 35:47.922
You're going to that party?

35:47.924 --> 35:49.924
Is that what this is all about?

35:49.926 --> 35:52.028
You're just using my
family as an excuse?

35:53.162 --> 35:55.095
I said you can come
if you wanted to.

35:55.097 --> 35:56.897
I said I was going, days ago.

35:56.899 --> 35:59.465
No, you said it
would be cool to go.

35:59.467 --> 36:01.168
No, I said I was going.

36:01.170 --> 36:02.836
Do you wanna go or not?

36:02.838 --> 36:04.171
I'm good.

36:04.173 --> 36:05.374
All right, see ya.

36:46.048 --> 36:51.053
Tom!

36:56.758 --> 36:58.425
Tom!

37:03.866 --> 37:06.266
Tommy, you're
gonna be all right.

37:06.268 --> 37:07.937
Tom, oh, poor boy.

37:09.271 --> 37:10.339
What happened, Tom?

37:11.706 --> 37:13.943
Reece, what's going on here?

37:14.944 --> 37:16.045
The hell's going on?

37:21.683 --> 37:24.451
Ah, fuck, no connection.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.554
Shit.

37:28.190 --> 37:29.191
Where the hell am I?

37:31.659 --> 37:33.193
Oh, god.

37:33.195 --> 37:35.329
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

37:36.165 --> 37:37.133
Yes!

37:38.267 --> 37:40.467
Hey, Lexi.

37:40.469 --> 37:41.504
Show me the way home.

37:47.376 --> 37:48.942
Yes!

37:48.944 --> 37:51.013
All right, let's get
the hell outta here.

38:06.996 --> 38:07.830
Hello?

38:10.166 --> 38:11.000
Anyone in?

38:33.289 --> 38:35.823
What are you doing on my boat?

39:16.499 --> 39:17.333
So.

39:19.034 --> 39:21.368
What are you doing on my boat?

39:21.370 --> 39:22.538
The Candywitch.

39:25.808 --> 39:27.977
Her name was Jennifer Harper.

39:29.145 --> 39:31.512
I don't refer to her
like the locals do.

39:31.514 --> 39:33.080
It's insulting to name the dead.

39:33.082 --> 39:34.515
The dead?

39:34.517 --> 39:36.083
Yes.

39:36.085 --> 39:39.086
I haven't seen
any proof of her death.

39:39.088 --> 39:41.924
What, you think she just
picked up, packed up and left?

39:45.660 --> 39:47.196
What do you wanna
know about her?

39:48.864 --> 39:51.098
I saw an article online.

39:51.100 --> 39:54.301
You think she's dead,
something happened to her.

39:54.303 --> 39:56.870
My boyfriend, he's
a psychic medium.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.606
He was brought here
by the people at 106.

39:59.608 --> 40:00.742
Cronehill Farm?

40:02.278 --> 40:04.313
Ruth and her family?

40:06.748 --> 40:07.682
Oh, please.

40:09.717 --> 40:11.684
What, they think the
past has come back

40:11.686 --> 40:13.389
to haunt them now, do they?

40:14.423 --> 40:15.257
Sorry?

40:16.392 --> 40:19.161
If Jennifer Harper
is up there, somewhere,

40:20.262 --> 40:21.530
looking down on us,

40:22.932 --> 40:24.800
then I hope she is
messing with them,

40:25.968 --> 40:27.570
'cause hell knows
they deserve it.

40:30.072 --> 40:31.173
Come on, come on, come on.

40:39.114 --> 40:40.614
Hey.

40:40.616 --> 40:41.417
Excuse me?

40:45.387 --> 40:46.155
Hello?

40:48.157 --> 40:51.124
Um, I'm lost in the woods?

40:51.126 --> 40:52.561
My phone's died and...

40:57.633 --> 40:58.634
Yo, hello?

41:07.009 --> 41:08.143
Hey, excuse me.

41:10.279 --> 41:11.113
Hello?

41:12.114 --> 41:12.948
Hey, yo!

41:58.327 --> 42:01.730
They said she was
abusing their children.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.266
It's a small town.

42:06.268 --> 42:08.468
Reputation is everything.

42:08.470 --> 42:11.171
You don't think
she hurt the children?

42:11.173 --> 42:13.409
I don't know what
went on in that house,

42:14.576 --> 42:17.781
but all I know is, she
loved all children.

42:18.947 --> 42:21.216
She always wanted
to have a baby.

42:22.751 --> 42:25.187
This town is full of rumors.

42:26.121 --> 42:27.791
Dirty little secrets.

42:29.224 --> 42:32.125
And the more you tell a rumor,
the more people believe it.

42:32.127 --> 42:34.730
People go missing all the
time in a place like this.

42:37.633 --> 42:40.634
My own daughter ran
when she was 15.

42:40.636 --> 42:41.805
Just needed to get out.

42:52.314 --> 42:53.449
I should've done more.

42:56.318 --> 42:58.887
What happened on the lead
up to her disappearance?

43:02.658 --> 43:05.627
The rumors were
spreading like wildfire.

43:06.830 --> 43:09.698
She was supposedly
abusing those children.

43:10.599 --> 43:12.132
Tom.

43:12.134 --> 43:12.968
And Lea.

43:14.403 --> 43:17.272
Apparently the kids were
claiming she was beating them.

43:19.041 --> 43:22.846
Then rumor had it, she
was abducting children.

43:24.012 --> 43:25.314
But it was all a myth.

43:26.382 --> 43:27.750
How are you so sure?

43:31.253 --> 43:32.789
She came round here one time.

43:34.957 --> 43:36.125
She wanted help.

43:37.326 --> 43:38.594
I let her in my home.

43:58.313 --> 44:01.148
Evil, malicious
rumors spreading.

44:01.150 --> 44:02.317
She couldn't take it.

44:03.485 --> 44:04.951
She had said things
weren't going well

44:04.953 --> 44:06.686
at the house with the kids.

44:06.688 --> 44:08.790
That rumors were spreading,

44:08.792 --> 44:11.260
that Ruth was starting
to not trust her anymore.

44:14.663 --> 44:15.832
I should've helped her.

44:17.199 --> 44:20.702
I failed her, and I
regret it every day.

44:22.371 --> 44:24.139
I didn't know what to believe.

44:27.142 --> 44:29.445
Deep down, I knew she
didn't have it in her,

44:30.946 --> 44:32.614
to do those things.

44:34.683 --> 44:35.984
But I went along with it,

44:36.920 --> 44:38.253
and I asked her to leave.

44:39.321 --> 44:40.456
Sent her back to them.

44:45.727 --> 44:48.730
She came here, asking for help.

44:50.098 --> 44:52.234
Claiming I was the only one
left who could help her.

44:54.470 --> 44:56.940
She begged me not to
send her back to them.

45:00.175 --> 45:01.643
But I turned my back on it.

45:05.347 --> 45:07.616
And I believe I am part
of the reason why...

45:09.685 --> 45:10.752
Why she vanished.

45:11.855 --> 45:13.355
Where do you think she went?

45:18.994 --> 45:21.796
I think this town
are responsible.

45:21.798 --> 45:23.898
They did something to her.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.801
I don't know what,

45:26.235 --> 45:29.071
but this town are the reason
why she is no longer here.

45:30.772 --> 45:32.774
And if it is true, what you say,

45:34.676 --> 45:36.078
that she is back,

45:37.546 --> 45:39.414
that she is here, for them,

45:41.450 --> 45:43.552
then they have a price to pay.

45:52.127 --> 45:53.995
Your parents are
looking into the pipework.

45:53.997 --> 45:54.831
Useless.

45:56.098 --> 45:57.531
Do you need some help?

45:57.533 --> 45:58.467
What's the point?

46:00.168 --> 46:02.502
It's never gonna stop, is it?

46:02.504 --> 46:03.572
What are you saying?

46:06.475 --> 46:07.476
She did things.

46:08.544 --> 46:09.378
To me.

46:11.647 --> 46:14.116
When I was younger,
about 15, 16.

46:16.118 --> 46:18.184
You know, at that
age, you're growing,

46:18.186 --> 46:19.454
and learning and...

46:21.123 --> 46:23.158
The worst part is I
felt fucking special.

46:28.363 --> 46:29.197
Now I...

46:33.769 --> 46:37.070
People say that ghosts
don't exist, but,

46:37.072 --> 46:38.041
everyone's haunted.

46:41.945 --> 46:43.312
I just want her to be gone.

47:27.723 --> 47:29.558
Where have you
been today, sweetie?

47:32.527 --> 47:34.361
I went for a walk around.

47:34.363 --> 47:36.630
Got some pickup shots of
your lovely little village.

47:36.632 --> 47:38.465
I think that'll edit
together really nicely.

47:38.467 --> 47:42.335
I, uh, been informed by a
neighbor that you been visiting

47:42.337 --> 47:45.238
that crazy lady on
the river, Trish?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.075
I did.

47:49.478 --> 47:54.349
We would really appreciate
you just sticking to your job.

47:55.785 --> 47:59.854
Instead of listening to the
crazy rants of some woman

47:59.856 --> 48:01.523
who's half lost her mind.

48:02.524 --> 48:03.791
I didn't mean to intrude.

48:03.793 --> 48:06.194
Look, ignore her,
she's struggling.

48:08.163 --> 48:10.232
We haven't slept a
decent night in weeks.

48:13.168 --> 48:14.003
That'll be Tiff.

48:30.153 --> 48:33.022
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:34.523 --> 48:35.357
Come on.

48:39.628 --> 48:41.394
I'm never gonna get
tired of this house.

48:41.396 --> 48:42.930
Thanks for
coming out here.

48:42.932 --> 48:47.500
Oh, this is Kat, she's doing
some stuff around the house.

48:47.502 --> 48:49.105
Everyone into the dining room.

52:48.610 --> 52:50.179
Jennifer?

52:56.718 --> 53:00.453
If that is y...

53:00.455 --> 53:03.390
And if you are here.

53:03.392 --> 53:06.996
If it is true that
you are here, with us,

53:08.364 --> 53:09.298
in death...

53:13.869 --> 53:17.472
Then I am sorry for
turning my back on you.

54:43.059 --> 54:45.094
So, what's the
plan behind this?

54:47.530 --> 54:48.563
A seance.

54:51.100 --> 54:52.234
To connect to Jennifer.

54:53.969 --> 54:56.571
Whoever it is I feel within
the walls of this house.

54:58.573 --> 54:59.774
You have seen it?

55:02.511 --> 55:04.313
I believe there
is something here.

55:07.817 --> 55:09.251
The Candywitch?

55:10.152 --> 55:11.251
I need to make sure it is her,

55:11.253 --> 55:13.055
and not a spirit within a shell.

55:13.956 --> 55:15.324
So, what are we gonna do?

55:16.292 --> 55:17.460
We hold hands.

55:19.627 --> 55:22.064
We breathe, in the same rhythm.

55:23.232 --> 55:25.468
And at no point do
we break the circle.

55:26.936 --> 55:28.802
Take each other's hands.

55:28.804 --> 55:31.706
I'll take over now while Reece
connects to the other side.

55:50.192 --> 55:52.893
Will this expel the spirit?

55:52.895 --> 55:54.895
This is about communication.

55:54.897 --> 55:58.731
Finding out what it wants from
the house, from the family.

55:58.733 --> 56:01.504
Everybody close your eyes
and lower your heads.

56:03.439 --> 56:06.342
Start to take a deep breath
in through your nose,

56:08.410 --> 56:10.946
and slowly out
through your mouth.

56:16.118 --> 56:19.155
Keeping calm, out
through your mouths.

56:20.322 --> 56:23.025
Giving up your energy
for those passed to use.

56:24.659 --> 56:27.294
Allowing them to connect
to us in this very moment

56:27.296 --> 56:28.531
in which we live in.

56:31.233 --> 56:32.034
Spirit.

56:34.637 --> 56:36.038
I ask for your presence.

56:37.506 --> 56:38.807
I offer you our energy.

56:42.778 --> 56:44.013
A place to be present.

56:46.448 --> 56:47.749
A place to be listened to.

56:48.918 --> 56:49.818
To be seen.

57:01.163 --> 57:02.762
Is it working?

57:02.764 --> 57:03.899
Please be silent.

57:09.271 --> 57:12.206
Spirit.

57:12.208 --> 57:14.074
When I open my eyes,

57:14.076 --> 57:14.910
be present.

57:16.412 --> 57:17.546
Stand before me.

57:26.121 --> 57:28.023
Someone tell
me what's going on?

57:33.629 --> 57:34.463
Spirit.

57:37.299 --> 57:39.034
I'm trying to
communicate with you.

57:42.471 --> 57:43.439
I mean you no harm.

57:46.208 --> 57:47.309
I'm here to help you.

57:48.877 --> 57:49.878
What is going on?

58:00.556 --> 58:02.725
Spirit, why do you come here?

58:10.232 --> 58:14.069
Something is in this
room with us, isn't it?

58:16.939 --> 58:20.173
Someone answer me,
what is going on?

58:56.645 --> 58:57.878
No, I can't!

58:57.880 --> 58:58.782
Ruth, no!

59:25.307 --> 59:26.575
What'd you see?

59:50.299 --> 59:52.299
Does it hurt?

59:52.301 --> 59:53.135
She's here.

59:55.704 --> 59:57.940
And she's got a grudge so deep,

59:58.974 --> 01:00:00.209
so bitter and twisted.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.780
I've never dealt with
anything like this before.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.848
What happened in there?

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:07.683
Nothing.

01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:12.619
Your hearing, if
this is affecting you,

01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:15.021
with your health,
we've gotta give it up.

01:00:15.023 --> 01:00:16.325
Reece, it's not worth it.

01:00:17.493 --> 01:00:18.927
No, I can't give
up on this now.

01:00:20.028 --> 01:00:22.765
I, I think
we should go home.

01:00:24.199 --> 01:00:28.803
The fans won't mind, we can
spin it as a, I don't know,

01:00:28.805 --> 01:00:30.570
a beast we couldn't tame.

01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:06.139
Where are you going?

01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:07.009
What did you see?

01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:17.953
We gotta get inside that shed.

01:01:19.856 --> 01:01:21.223
You're gonna need these.

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:25.827
That circle...

01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:27.162
Seance thing?

01:01:28.898 --> 01:01:30.798
I don't know how
you guys did it.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.265
Lea?

01:01:32.267 --> 01:01:35.870
You've gotta believe us,
we didn't do anything.

01:01:35.872 --> 01:01:36.906
Fine.

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:40.075
But I wanna see
what you're up to.

01:03:17.272 --> 01:03:18.638
Tiff, wait.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.007
Wait.

01:03:20.009 --> 01:03:21.510
Relax.

01:04:32.147 --> 01:04:33.446
Tiffany.

01:04:33.448 --> 01:04:36.083
Ow, my back hurts.

01:04:38.654 --> 01:04:43.659
Tiffany, my back.

01:04:50.332 --> 01:04:51.566
Tiff, it hurts.

01:04:59.374 --> 01:05:01.976
This is what you
wanted, isn't it, Tom?

01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:23.465
Tom.

01:05:25.267 --> 01:05:26.102
What?

01:05:29.271 --> 01:05:30.205
What is it?

01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:33.642
What is it?

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.074
Don't know what
I'm looking for, but,

01:06:07.076 --> 01:06:09.078
she wanted me to find
something in here.

01:06:23.492 --> 01:06:24.459
Oh, my god.

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:27.964
I remember this.

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:33.401
It's all our stuff
from when we were kids.

01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:37.773
Why do your parents
keep it locked up?

01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:41.077
I guess they
use it as storage.

01:06:51.187 --> 01:06:52.619
What's this?

01:06:52.621 --> 01:06:55.490
Oh I think
that's our family photo album.

01:06:57.592 --> 01:06:58.426
Yeah.

01:06:59.361 --> 01:07:00.930
Jennifer should be inside here.

01:07:19.248 --> 01:07:20.183
Yeah, look.

01:07:22.051 --> 01:07:22.985
There's me.

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:25.453
Tom.

01:07:29.558 --> 01:07:30.392
And Jennifer.

01:07:38.466 --> 01:07:39.902
So, I'm intrigued.

01:07:41.336 --> 01:07:44.040
What exactly do you think she
wanted you to find in here?

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:49.245
I'm not sure.

01:07:50.712 --> 01:07:54.181
But whatever it is,
she wanted us to uncover it.

01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:56.683
It might end this
for your family.

01:07:56.685 --> 01:07:58.154
The neighbor, Trish, she...

01:07:59.822 --> 01:08:02.790
She said she thinks the
rumors might be lies.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:05.758
She doesn't think Jennifer
committed any crimes.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.495
I have the scars the prove it.

01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:11.431
And my brother has the
most disturbing memories of

01:08:11.433 --> 01:08:14.767
her doing horrendous
things to him.

01:08:14.769 --> 01:08:16.238
She's pure evil.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.144
Whatever that crazy
lady told you was a lie.

01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:25.979
Please don't go.

01:08:25.982 --> 01:08:27.479
I wanna support you,

01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:29.082
but I think you need to
get the hell out of here.

01:08:29.085 --> 01:08:31.419
Well, come on, come with me.

01:08:32.787 --> 01:08:34.720
I wanna move on,
really, I do, but...

01:08:34.723 --> 01:08:35.957
Well, then leave!

01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:38.457
Now.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.127
I can't leave my family.

01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:42.296
Well, I'm
leaving this house now,

01:08:42.298 --> 01:08:43.698
and I want you to follow me.

01:09:47.562 --> 01:09:48.397
May I?

01:10:19.561 --> 01:10:21.862
What year did she join
you as your nanny?

01:10:21.864 --> 01:10:22.697
Oh, god.

01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:24.666
'97?

01:10:42.018 --> 01:10:43.319
Reece?

01:11:32.134 --> 01:11:35.302
What were you doing outside
at this time of night?

01:11:55.657 --> 01:11:56.892
I don't understand.

01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:05.466
That matches
the marks on my legs.

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:07.036
Your mom has a walking stick?

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:13.242
And they owned it before
Jennifer begun working here?

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:18.247
This could be more.

01:12:41.769 --> 01:12:42.770
Oh, god, no.

01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:05.594
You were supposed to help
get rid of that spirit.

01:13:06.761 --> 01:13:10.097
But all you have done
is cause problems here,

01:13:10.099 --> 01:13:11.731
in my house.

01:13:11.733 --> 01:13:15.135
I wanted you to get rid of her.

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:17.840
I didn't want you
to give her a voice.

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:20.908
Mom!

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.476
Dad!

01:13:22.478 --> 01:13:23.279
Where's Tom?

01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:37.927
You abused those children.

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:40.362
It wasn't her.

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.897
When I was a little girl,

01:13:43.899 --> 01:13:46.669
my mother did far worse.

01:13:48.304 --> 01:13:51.205
A little discipline
didn't hurt anyone.

01:13:51.207 --> 01:13:52.174
This was all you.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:56.612
Why couldn't you just
keep your mouth shut?

01:13:57.846 --> 01:14:00.147
She's here because
of what you did to her.

01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:01.383
She had it coming.

01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:06.889
All that she got, she
deserved, I assure you.

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.191
Why did you do it?

01:14:10.326 --> 01:14:11.325
Why did you allow
her to take the blame

01:14:11.327 --> 01:14:13.460
for your children's abuse?

01:14:13.462 --> 01:14:15.329
You don't have children.

01:14:15.331 --> 01:14:17.099
No, I looked.

01:14:18.234 --> 01:14:22.171
All your pretty little
perfect life online.

01:14:23.272 --> 01:14:25.541
She touched him!

01:14:27.076 --> 01:14:30.446
That disgusting, filthy bitch,

01:14:31.981 --> 01:14:34.083
defiled my son.

01:14:35.884 --> 01:14:38.852
No mother, no parent,

01:14:38.854 --> 01:14:42.191
would ever let anyone
like that not suffer.

01:14:43.926 --> 01:14:47.529
She tore this family to pieces.

01:14:48.931 --> 01:14:53.533
It was justice that her
partner came to know

01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:56.270
what kind of person she was.

01:14:56.272 --> 01:14:59.708
She found him hanging from
the ceiling the next day.

01:15:00.876 --> 01:15:04.378
I didn't feel sorry for
her in the slightest.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.147
She is a monster.

01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:08.684
You must see that.

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:49.485
Tiffany?

01:16:51.186 --> 01:16:52.018
Tiffany?

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.587
Hey, hey, hey, Tiff!

01:16:53.589 --> 01:16:54.588
Tiff, wake up, hey!

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:55.989
Hey, can you hear me?

01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:56.826
Tiff!

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.294
Tiff, can you,
Jesus Christ, Tiff!

01:17:23.919 --> 01:17:24.753
Dad?

01:17:27.423 --> 01:17:28.624
Dad, what are you doing?

01:17:32.261 --> 01:17:33.262
We need to find Tom.

01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:36.565
Have you seen him?

01:17:47.976 --> 01:17:52.245
You knew, and you
didn't say anything?

01:17:52.247 --> 01:17:56.985
No, because if I had,
more people would be hurt.

01:18:01.356 --> 01:18:02.691
He was obsessed with her.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.726
How long?

01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:07.162
Years.

01:18:13.635 --> 01:18:15.571
All the letters he
wrote, she kept.

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:22.846
I thought it was mutual,
but after she rejected him,

01:18:23.813 --> 01:18:25.547
he made the accusations.

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:33.790
She was the innocent
one all along?

01:18:37.392 --> 01:18:38.494
I need to go find Tom.

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:42.966
Lea.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:09.456
No!

01:19:15.932 --> 01:19:19.867
Get off me!

01:19:19.869 --> 01:19:21.334
Jesus Christ, Jen.

01:19:21.336 --> 01:19:22.269
Listen to me, please!

01:19:22.271 --> 01:19:24.805
Please, she didn't do anything!

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:36.383
She didn't do anything,
please listen to me!

01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:37.250
Jennifer!

01:19:37.252 --> 01:19:38.451
Jennifer, listen!

01:19:38.453 --> 01:19:41.755
Please.

01:19:41.757 --> 01:19:43.690
Please listen.

01:20:02.144 --> 01:20:02.979
Fuck!

01:20:04.047 --> 01:20:04.881
Fuck!

01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:11.084
God!

01:20:11.086 --> 01:20:13.587
You made her out to be a
monster, that's why there was

01:20:13.589 --> 01:20:16.456
no proof of those town's
children vanishing.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:19.695
It was just town's
gossip out of control.

01:20:21.129 --> 01:20:25.565
I had to make sure
that the town hated her.

01:20:25.567 --> 01:20:29.906
I wanted the town to
hate her, to fear her.

01:20:31.273 --> 01:20:35.275
So that when she went
missing, no one would care.

01:20:35.277 --> 01:20:37.044
No one would miss her.

01:20:37.046 --> 01:20:38.246
That's why she's here.

01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.316
That's why she won't
leave you alone.

01:20:42.484 --> 01:20:45.619
'Cause she has a grudge
so deep to the core,

01:20:45.621 --> 01:20:48.791
that she can't,
she won't move on.

01:20:49.993 --> 01:20:52.626
What's the one thing
you would do if someone

01:20:52.628 --> 01:20:57.098
hurt your child, if they
touched your child in that way?

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:00.300
You would make sure they
could never do it again.

01:21:06.075 --> 01:21:07.574
You killed her.

01:21:07.576 --> 01:21:11.146
We buried her out
back, behind the house.

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:17.918
We buried her, hoping that
no one would ever find her.

01:21:22.758 --> 01:21:23.993
Just kill me!

01:21:25.193 --> 01:21:26.294
Just kill me.

01:22:05.935 --> 01:22:06.635
Tom!

01:22:21.884 --> 01:22:23.818
Kat?

01:22:37.766 --> 01:22:40.203
I think we need to go,
this really isn't safe.

01:22:43.271 --> 01:22:45.940
- What?
- Reece, we need to leave now.

01:22:45.942 --> 01:22:48.441
There is more to this
family than we know about.

01:22:48.443 --> 01:22:50.710
I know, Ruth told me.

01:22:50.712 --> 01:22:52.447
She knew too, about Tom?

01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:54.347
What?

01:22:54.349 --> 01:22:55.883
He lied!

01:22:55.885 --> 01:22:57.918
He was obsessed with her and
when he couldn't have her,

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.587
he made it seem like
she'd abused him.

01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:04.225
But, Ruth, she killed her.

01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:05.425
For Tom?

01:23:05.427 --> 01:23:06.894
Oh, my god.

01:23:06.896 --> 01:23:08.296
We need to call the police.

01:23:10.233 --> 01:23:11.067
Are you okay?

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.767
It's not leaving.

01:23:13.769 --> 01:23:15.435
Reece, what's happening?

01:23:15.437 --> 01:23:17.140
She's sure, I can feel it.

01:23:22.145 --> 01:23:23.678
We need to find her bones.

01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:28.717
She can't move on because
they've kept them here.

01:23:30.285 --> 01:23:31.786
And she will kill
anyone that's pained her

01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:33.222
until we find them.

01:23:34.456 --> 01:23:35.290
Guys?

01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:37.557
We need to find him.

01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:38.961
If it's true, he's not safe.

01:23:40.196 --> 01:23:41.296
He was with Tiffany.

01:23:55.343 --> 01:23:58.145
What the hell is that?

01:23:58.147 --> 01:23:59.381
Why is the car door open?

01:24:00.682 --> 01:24:01.483
Oh.

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:03.920
Oh, my god!

01:24:08.157 --> 01:24:09.225
It's Tiffany.

01:24:15.965 --> 01:24:16.799
Tom!

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:22.635
Tom.

01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:29.375
No.

01:24:29.377 --> 01:24:30.213
Tom.

01:24:32.048 --> 01:24:32.949
Oh, my god.

01:24:41.157 --> 01:24:45.025
Oh, my god, my baby,
what has she done to you?

01:24:45.027 --> 01:24:45.928
Oh, no, no.

01:25:06.148 --> 01:25:08.150
Reece, where
are you taking us?

01:25:10.119 --> 01:25:11.519
She said she buried her.

01:25:15.258 --> 01:25:18.593
This land, the energy
here is deafening.

01:25:27.303 --> 01:25:28.137
She...

01:28:32.221 --> 01:28:33.055
Jennifer!

01:28:35.623 --> 01:28:38.058
We used to get along,
what're you doing?

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:38.894
You!

01:28:40.096 --> 01:28:40.930
Knew!

01:28:43.631 --> 01:28:44.666
I never hurt you!

01:28:46.268 --> 01:28:48.368
Jennifer, I never
did anything to you!

01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:49.872
You did nothing!

01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:55.209
You need to leave
my family alone.

01:28:55.211 --> 01:28:56.711
You need to leave!

01:28:59.815 --> 01:29:01.415
What're you doing?

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:02.349
You need to go!

01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:15.929
Leave!

01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:17.097
Now!

01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:29.711
Your name is nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:29:32.815 --> 01:29:36.385
You will no longer die
with those memories.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.355
And your body...

01:29:41.257 --> 01:29:42.823
Your body has been found.

01:30:00.476 --> 01:30:02.144
You can move on now.

01:30:41.217 --> 01:30:42.251
Is that it?

01:30:43.452 --> 01:30:44.685
Did it work?

01:30:48.490 --> 01:30:50.157
It worked.

01:30:50.159 --> 01:30:51.126
Dad!

01:30:52.561 --> 01:30:54.061
Reece, honey.

01:30:54.063 --> 01:30:55.030
You're okay.

01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:06.242
Did you call the police?

01:31:17.519 --> 01:31:18.354
Are you okay?

01:31:19.221 --> 01:31:21.223
Are you hurt in any way?
