00:16.536 --> 00:17.833
- Harrison Wright?
- Quinn Perkins.

00:17.937 --> 00:19.029
- I can't stay.
- What are you drinking?

00:19.138 --> 00:20.127
I can't stay. I'm sorry.

00:20.239 --> 00:22.639
I only came because Lori wouldn't
give me your number so I could cancel,

00:22.742 --> 00:23.709
and I didn't want you to be waiting here

00:23.810 --> 00:25.244
because getting stood up
in this particular bar

00:25.346 --> 00:26.938
is like falling face down on a runway.

00:27.147 --> 00:28.114
And even though I don't know you,

00:28.215 --> 00:29.512
Lori's got this annoying habit
of meddling,

00:29.616 --> 00:30.981
- so it seemed only decent...
- What are you drinking?

00:31.085 --> 00:33.110
I can't stay, is what I am saying.
I don't do blind dates.

00:33.287 --> 00:35.620
My parents met on a blind date.
They've been inseparable ever since.

00:35.724 --> 00:36.952
I'm happy for your parents, and for you,

00:37.058 --> 00:38.719
because it means you exist.
But I don't do blind dates.

00:38.827 --> 00:40.124
- This isn't a blind date.
- What?

00:40.228 --> 00:41.559
It's a job interview.
What are you drinking?

00:42.063 --> 00:43.826
Dirty martini. What do you mean
this is a job interview?

00:43.932 --> 00:45.730
- This is a job interview.
- You're a baby lawyer.

00:45.835 --> 00:47.393
- You're 12 years old.
- I am 28 years old.

00:47.503 --> 00:48.663
Why aren't we sitting in an office
in a law firm?

00:48.771 --> 00:49.965
'Cause that's not how we do
job interviews.

00:50.072 --> 00:51.061
- I didn't apply for a job with you.
- You did.

00:51.173 --> 00:52.140
- I didn't.
- You did.

00:52.241 --> 00:53.971
Okay. You know what?
This has been... Whatever.

00:54.077 --> 00:56.045
- But I don't do blind dates, so...
- Ask me who I work for.

00:56.179 --> 00:57.168
- What?
- You

00:57.280 --> 00:58.907
really wanna ask me who I work for.

00:59.015 --> 00:59.982
Fine. Who do you work for?

01:00.083 --> 01:01.175
Olivia Pope.

01:04.122 --> 01:07.853
Olivia Pope? The Olivia Pope?

01:07.959 --> 01:10.621
Wait. Shut up.

01:10.728 --> 01:12.355
Is this some kind of ploy
to make me stay on this date?

01:12.497 --> 01:14.227
Quinn, this is not a blind date.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.698
On blind dates,
I like to buy a woman dinner

01:15.801 --> 01:17.393
because it makes her more likely
to either sleep with me

01:17.503 --> 01:19.937
or give me a second date.
When I buy you dinner,

01:20.205 --> 01:21.229
you'll know I'm interested.

01:21.573 --> 01:22.733
You did apply for a job with me.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.104
The way I know
you applied for a job with me

01:24.210 --> 01:25.837
is that I have your résumé on my iPad.

01:26.146 --> 01:27.773
The way I know
you'd kill puppies to get this job

01:27.881 --> 01:30.042
is the way you stopped breathing
when I said the name Olivia Pope.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.380
Which is a tell, your tell,
which you should look at,

01:32.485 --> 01:34.852
'cause I'm going to offer you
a crap salary and you'll have to take it,

01:34.955 --> 01:37.515
'cause you never really learned how
to breathe in and out without stopping.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.650
But don't feel bad,
because we all get paid crap salaries,

01:39.760 --> 01:41.250
because we're the good guys.
I'm a good guy,

01:41.362 --> 01:43.456
which means I generally don't lie,
but I just did to you.

01:43.899 --> 01:44.991
This is not a job interview.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.795
Wait. I don't... I'm confused.

01:46.902 --> 01:49.427
Olivia already told me to hire you.
The job is yours if you want it.

01:49.838 --> 01:52.272
The best job you'll ever have.
You'll change lives, slay dragons,

01:52.374 --> 01:53.637
love the hunt
more than you ever dreamed,

01:53.743 --> 01:56.644
because Olivia Pope is as amazing
as they say.

01:58.047 --> 02:00.447
And, uh...
I'm not a baby lawyer.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.414
I'm a gladiator in a suit,

02:02.518 --> 02:04.146
'cause that's what you are
when you work for Olivia.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.984
You're a gladiator in a suit.
Do you wanna be a gladiator in a suit?

02:07.591 --> 02:08.558
You gotta say it.

02:09.293 --> 02:11.693
I wanna be a gladiator in a suit.

02:12.986 --> 02:14.926
<i>sync and corrections by majtjkong</i>

02:23.275 --> 02:24.264
We're going to get killed.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.037
Did you propose?
Weren't you going to ask her tonight?

02:26.145 --> 02:27.635
I was doing this tonight.
Liv, we're gonna get killed.

02:27.746 --> 02:28.804
We're $3 million short.

02:28.914 --> 02:30.404
So you flaked. Why are we short?

02:30.516 --> 02:31.778
The Ambassador
couldn't come up with the rest,

02:31.884 --> 02:33.352
which is a problem, a very big problem,

02:33.453 --> 02:35.250
why we shouldn't even be going
up there in the first place.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.016
And I did not flake. I'm working. For you.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.249
Don't worry,
they'll take what we give them.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.689
Did you at least buy
the engagement ring?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.851
Ukrainian mobsters
do not take what you give them,

02:42.029 --> 02:43.997
they just shoot you.
So we have bigger things to worry about

02:44.098 --> 02:45.588
than me not proposing to my girlfriend.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.792
We are in a situation here. Focus.
Do what you do.

02:54.276 --> 02:56.073
Good evening, gentlemen.

02:56.178 --> 02:57.907
- You got the money?
- Of course. All three million.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.613
- We said six.
- Did we?

02:59.815 --> 03:01.373
- We did!
- I have three.

03:03.086 --> 03:04.053
That's a problem.

03:04.153 --> 03:06.280
Well, it's all the Ambassador had
on such short notice,

03:06.389 --> 03:08.220
so you're just gonna have to take it.

03:08.491 --> 03:10.220
Leave the three.
When you come back with the rest...

03:10.326 --> 03:12.386
- Liv.
... we have a deal.

03:16.033 --> 03:17.967
- That's not gonna happen, Oskar.
- No?

03:18.202 --> 03:19.999
<i>Nyet, What's going to happen is,</i>

03:20.104 --> 03:21.766
you and Vlad
are going to take the three million

03:21.973 --> 03:24.908
and leave right now for Dulles
to make your flight to the motherland.

03:25.010 --> 03:26.807
The reason
you're going to want to go right now,

03:26.945 --> 03:28.572
beside the fact
that it's just good travel sense

03:28.713 --> 03:30.738
to give yourself enough time
for international check-in,

03:30.849 --> 03:33.011
is in exactly four hours and 15 minutes,

03:33.319 --> 03:35.310
both of your names
are going to suddenly pop up

03:35.421 --> 03:37.355
on Homeland Security's No-Fly list.

03:37.456 --> 03:40.186
Lucky for you, you're booked on a flight
that leaves in two and a half hours.

03:40.293 --> 03:43.695
So if it were me,
I'd much rather spend $3 million in Kiev

03:43.797 --> 03:46.129
than here in Georgetown,
way more bang for your buck.

03:46.233 --> 03:49.259
In fact, it may even feel
like six once you're there.

03:58.813 --> 04:01.374
Good boys. So, since we have a deal,

04:02.117 --> 04:04.085
I am gonna take what we paid for.

04:04.253 --> 04:05.277
Pleasure doing business with you.

04:05.421 --> 04:09.585
I thank you. My client thanks you.
And I hope to never see you again.

04:10.627 --> 04:12.060
God, I love this job.

04:22.873 --> 04:24.397
Do I look okay?

04:24.508 --> 04:27.409
Too much cleavage.
Olivia will talk about you.

04:27.511 --> 04:29.138
Just take it in.

04:29.246 --> 04:31.681
This is Huck. He's our tech guy.
Used to be CIA. Right, Huck?

04:31.783 --> 04:33.614
- I don't talk about that. New girl?
- New girl.

04:33.752 --> 04:35.515
Are you sure she's here? It's late.

04:35.621 --> 04:37.919
She's here. She's always here.
That's Stephen. That's Abby.

04:38.056 --> 04:39.751
He's a litigator, she's an investigator.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.551
- And that's...
- Olivia Pope.

04:44.464 --> 04:45.658
Come on.

04:46.666 --> 04:47.928
I'm not doing it.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.935
Well, I'm not doing it either.
- Don't look at me.

04:50.070 --> 04:51.367
- How'd it go?
- We gave them three million.

04:51.472 --> 04:53.099
They gave us the package.

04:53.207 --> 04:54.674
Three million down,
the woman doesn't flinch.

04:55.442 --> 04:57.069
We're just waiting for pick up.

04:57.911 --> 04:58.935
Too much cleavage.

04:59.146 --> 05:01.274
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that I was coming here.

05:01.416 --> 05:02.815
Can I just say that I am a huge fan.

05:02.951 --> 05:04.179
I so admire your work
in the White House.

05:04.285 --> 05:05.752
It is an honor to work for your law firm.

05:05.854 --> 05:09.085
We're not a law firm.
We're lawyers, but this is not a law firm.

05:09.190 --> 05:11.284
- Law firms are for pansies.
We solve problems.

05:11.427 --> 05:13.156
Manage crises. Save reputations.

05:13.295 --> 05:15.263
Right. Of course. It's still an honor.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.425
Harrison feed you a line
about being a gladiator in a suit?

05:19.536 --> 05:21.731
- Liv.
- He did. And I am ready to gladiate.

05:21.838 --> 05:22.805
Or whatever.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.840
You know how to gladiate
a diaper change?

05:30.615 --> 05:31.775
Thank you,

05:32.316 --> 05:34.079
thank you.
When the Russians kidnapped him,

05:34.185 --> 05:35.174
I thought...

05:35.286 --> 05:37.049
But you've returned my son back to me.

05:37.221 --> 05:38.518
Thank you.

05:40.192 --> 05:42.422
Anything I can do for you. Anything.

05:42.528 --> 05:43.552
If you ever have a second child,

05:44.229 --> 05:45.491
Olivia's a beautiful name.

05:45.631 --> 05:47.121
Mr. Ambassador,
you can take your son back

05:47.232 --> 05:48.757
to the consulate and keep him safe.

05:48.868 --> 05:51.132
And you can never tell anyone
about this.

05:51.371 --> 05:52.668
The FBI is sick of me.

05:53.206 --> 05:54.230
Of course.

05:54.507 --> 05:55.531
Thank you.

05:56.209 --> 05:57.176
Thank you.

06:04.051 --> 06:05.985
Good work, everyone.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.984
So, what...

06:18.401 --> 06:20.892
We've got incoming.

06:21.003 --> 06:23.130
It's after hours. Take
a message. We're going home.

06:23.239 --> 06:24.399
Not on the phone. Here.

06:24.574 --> 06:25.541
And you wanna talk to him.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.581
You have to help me.
Somebody has to help me.

06:36.887 --> 06:41.484
Please. My girlfriend. She's dead.

06:43.428 --> 06:44.725
The police think I killed her.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.426
Welcome to
Olivia Pope and Associates.

06:56.442 --> 06:59.241
Lieutenant Colonel
Sullivan "Sully" St. James,

06:59.346 --> 07:01.143
age 32, did two tours in Iraq,

07:01.281 --> 07:03.408
was injured saving the lives
of his entire unit.

07:03.583 --> 07:04.914
- A war hero.
- And not just any war hero.

07:05.018 --> 07:07.043
The first living Marine awarded
the Medal of Honor

07:07.155 --> 07:08.486
for action in any war since Vietnam.

07:08.589 --> 07:10.216
A famous war hero,
working class,

07:10.324 --> 07:12.121
patriotic, comes from
a long line of soldiers.

07:12.226 --> 07:13.284
Here he is with the President.

07:14.729 --> 07:16.697
Also, Sexiest Man Alive, 2010.

07:16.798 --> 07:17.993
Poster boy for the military.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.465
And for the conservative right.

07:19.601 --> 07:22.229
That's how he makes his living.
He gives expensive speeches.

07:22.371 --> 07:24.862
Makes a fortune.
He's anti-choice, pro-gun,

07:25.073 --> 07:27.042
hates the gays
and likes it when kids pray in school.

07:27.143 --> 07:28.576
- Abby.
- Just saying he sickens me politically.

07:28.678 --> 07:30.839
- I'm not saying we shouldn't help him.
- Who is the dead girlfriend?

07:30.947 --> 07:32.778
Paige Montgomery, 27.
Rich girl, good family.

07:32.882 --> 07:34.144
It's on the police scanners.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.947
Girl was found dead in her apartment,
three shots to the head.

07:37.054 --> 07:38.043
Three?
That's not an accident.

07:38.155 --> 07:40.919
Sully called 911,
but took off before the police arrived.

07:41.158 --> 07:42.819
What do we... Can I ask?

07:42.927 --> 07:45.157
What do we do?
I mean, if we aren't defense lawyers,

07:45.262 --> 07:47.094
we're not the State's Attorney,
it looks like he did it,

07:47.232 --> 07:48.790
so what do we do? What can we do?

07:48.900 --> 07:49.958
First, we interview Sully.

07:55.607 --> 07:56.870
I was gonna propose.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.573
We were gonna get married.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.108
Paige was everything to me.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.208
She was my best friend.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.306
We listen to him, we watch him.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.486
Did you kill her?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.487
No. I would never.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.722
I loved her.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.347
Where'd the blood come from?

08:11.458 --> 08:14.291
In this moment,
we are the judge and we are the jury.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.089
The media and the public opinion.

08:18.199 --> 08:21.225
Went to her apartment
and I found her like that.

08:21.636 --> 08:26.574
I held her.
But there was so much blood.

08:26.675 --> 08:29.200
I called the police and I panicked.

08:29.778 --> 08:32.871
I'm on TV, you know?
So, I didn't know what to do.

08:33.015 --> 08:34.778
I thought
that they would think that I did it.

08:35.852 --> 08:36.977
I panicked, I'm sorry.

08:37.087 --> 08:40.250
This is the moment
where we decide who he is.

08:40.357 --> 08:42.018
Where were you? During the murder?

08:42.392 --> 08:45.190
I walk at night. Around
the neighborhood. I was walking.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.287
And I stepped into Matty's Pub

08:47.431 --> 08:48.955
and then I had a beer.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.667
And then I kept walking.
Then I went to go see Paige.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.070
Do you own a handgun?

08:53.237 --> 08:55.331
Not since I left the military.

09:00.779 --> 09:03.145
I just don't believe she's actually gone.

09:03.248 --> 09:05.149
I vote no.
The guy's a fugitive covered in blood,

09:05.251 --> 09:06.775
not once did he question
who killed Paige,

09:06.920 --> 09:09.445
or ask us to find her killer.
We all know that's a red flag. He did it.

09:09.589 --> 09:10.681
No, I don't think he did.

09:10.790 --> 09:12.985
He's a soldier, a government-issue
trained killing machine.

09:13.092 --> 09:15.220
He'd have to be an idiot
to get her blood all over himself,

09:15.329 --> 09:18.787
call 911 and then run. But I still vote no.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.423
It's a media hand grenade.

09:20.534 --> 09:21.899
I don't wanna take it
because it's too messy,

09:22.002 --> 09:24.129
too much work. And I hate Republicans.

09:24.873 --> 09:27.740
My vote always comes down to my gut.

09:27.842 --> 09:29.673
My gut tells me
everything I need to know.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.507
We're taking the case.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.376
Why do we even bother voting?

09:33.481 --> 09:36.781
You're pretty and smart.
So pretty, so smart.

09:38.854 --> 09:40.344
Next I set the rules.

09:41.257 --> 09:44.055
We're going to give you a clean shirt
and put you in Stephen's office.

09:44.428 --> 09:45.554
You are to stay there.

09:45.729 --> 09:48.892
<i>No phone calls,
Not to work, not to friends, not to press,</i>

09:49.533 --> 09:52.058
No one. This is on us now.

09:52.169 --> 09:55.970
Your job is to stay in that office
and let us do our job.

09:56.074 --> 09:59.771
Then I warn them. I always warn them.

10:00.611 --> 10:02.841
I have one rule. Do not lie.

10:03.081 --> 10:04.879
You lie, all bets are off. Got it?

10:07.252 --> 10:10.517
Now, is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

10:12.658 --> 10:13.647
I didn't kill her.

10:15.762 --> 10:18.253
She was my best friend.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.625
I loved her.

10:35.584 --> 10:38.417
Why am I not
surprised that you're on this?

10:38.520 --> 10:41.250
You have to give me 48 hours before
you arrest or charge Sully St. James.

10:41.356 --> 10:42.345
I was sleeping.

10:42.457 --> 10:43.618
The U.S. Attorney's Office never sleeps.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.421
- You told me that once.
- I was being ironic.

10:45.528 --> 10:47.291
Forty-eight hours
before you arrest or charge.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.991
Olivia, you don't have
the muscle of the White House

10:50.099 --> 10:51.327
behind you anymore.

10:51.434 --> 10:54.370
You're just a private citizen who is,
by the way, annoying.

10:54.538 --> 10:55.732
He's a decorated war hero.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.807
He's a patriot.
You realize the blowback you'll get

10:57.908 --> 10:59.273
for rushing to judgment on a patriot?

10:59.510 --> 11:00.477
The blowback you'll create?

11:00.577 --> 11:01.942
Well, yeah. That's my job.

11:02.046 --> 11:03.378
Do you actually have the naive belief

11:03.481 --> 11:05.676
that waking me in the middle
of the night and threatening me

11:05.784 --> 11:07.479
is the correct path to getting your way?

11:07.585 --> 11:09.109
I wasn't threatening you.
He didn't kill her.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.287
My gut says he didn't.

11:10.455 --> 11:13.357
Your Spidey senses aren't evidence.

11:13.459 --> 11:16.428
I've been on the phone with Homicide.
He killed her and ran.

11:16.529 --> 11:18.520
I can have a reporter out here
in 20 minutes,

11:18.631 --> 11:21.065
with cameras,
asking why you are persecuting

11:21.167 --> 11:23.636
an innocent, handicapped,
Medal of Honor winner.

11:23.737 --> 11:26.228
Perhaps because he's a well-known
conservative Republican

11:26.339 --> 11:29.308
and you are considering a bid
on the Democratic ticket next year?

11:29.409 --> 11:31.741
Just to be clear,
that was me threatening you.

11:33.648 --> 11:35.275
- You have until morning.
- Thirty-six hours.

11:35.383 --> 11:36.611
- Twenty-four hours.
- Sold!

11:36.717 --> 11:37.911
Pleasure to see you again.

11:39.954 --> 11:43.015
Hey, Wally. Body still here
or did the morgue take it already?

11:43.125 --> 11:44.456
Go home. I'm not telling you a thing.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.755
You don't have to. I'll just take
a quick peek at the crime scene.

11:46.862 --> 11:47.829
Not on my watch.

11:47.930 --> 11:50.330
How's your wife, Wally?
She's what, six months pregnant?

11:50.432 --> 11:51.490
Does she know about the stripper?

11:51.867 --> 11:52.960
You're a real bitch, you know that?

11:53.069 --> 11:55.128
I do know that, Wally.

12:18.763 --> 12:21.231
So you guys don't try cases?
You don't go to court?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.529
If we do our jobs right,
we never need to go to court.

12:23.636 --> 12:25.263
No, look,
the reason we're not a law firm is

12:25.371 --> 12:27.100
we don't have to play
within the rules of the law.

12:27.273 --> 12:29.002
We're fixers, crisis managers.

12:29.108 --> 12:31.737
We make the problems of our client,
big or small, go away.

12:32.212 --> 12:35.773
It's not about solving a crime.
It's not about justice.

12:35.883 --> 12:37.783
It's about our client.

12:41.189 --> 12:42.383
- No.
- Lisa!

12:42.490 --> 12:43.548
- No!
- Lisa?

12:43.658 --> 12:45.717
- You didn't call me.
- I'm an ass.

12:45.827 --> 12:47.294
Who slept with me and didn't call me.

12:47.529 --> 12:49.258
I'm getting married.

12:49.364 --> 12:51.833
You? You're getting married. You.

12:52.001 --> 12:53.832
Her name is Georgia,
she teaches third grade.

12:53.936 --> 12:57.565
Which is why,
as much as I would like to,

12:58.207 --> 13:01.268
I can't do it with you
in the freezer anymore.

13:05.982 --> 13:06.971
What do you want?

13:07.384 --> 13:09.818
I need you to fast track an autopsy,
slip me the report.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.852
We've been here all night.

13:17.295 --> 13:18.421
Hey, don't you people ever sleep?

13:18.529 --> 13:22.398
Don't any of you have husbands,
wives and kids, lives?

13:22.501 --> 13:24.162
- No.
- Oh.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.305
Gladiators. In suits.

13:55.003 --> 13:57.130
We need more.

13:58.673 --> 14:03.111
The guy's alibi is water, bloody clothes
and he's a runner. He killed her.

14:03.212 --> 14:04.270
Definitely killed her.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.846
There. Gun was found on the scene.

14:06.949 --> 14:09.748
I'll work the cops. Find out
if there are any fingerprints on the gun.

14:09.853 --> 14:11.548
And there. Look at them.

14:11.655 --> 14:13.555
Look how he's looking at her.
He loves her.

14:13.657 --> 14:15.284
A guy in love only kills
if he has a motive.

14:16.493 --> 14:19.361
If he has a motive, we need to find it
before the police do.

14:19.464 --> 14:20.431
I have to step out.

14:20.665 --> 14:21.859
I'll be back.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.163
We need more!

14:27.238 --> 14:28.967
So what happens now?

14:29.074 --> 14:31.770
She wants more. We get more.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.223
What?

14:45.325 --> 14:46.986
Hi, hello, how are you?

14:47.093 --> 14:48.789
"Hi, hello, how are you" what?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.191
You working the Sully St. James thing?

14:50.298 --> 14:51.322
I'm trying to stamp out the flames.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.865
If you guys could refrain
from commenting...

14:52.967 --> 14:54.195
- What's your gut say?
- He didn't do it.

14:54.335 --> 14:55.734
Well, your gut's never wrong.
We'll stay quiet.

14:55.836 --> 14:57.326
But keep me in the loop.

14:57.705 --> 15:00.197
You didn't ask me here
to talk about Sully St. James.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.069
- He needs a favor.
- I don't work for him anymore.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.577
- He trusts you.
- I don't work for him anymore.

15:04.713 --> 15:05.975
And yet you came when I called.

15:10.186 --> 15:11.551
What?

15:11.654 --> 15:13.417
There's a girl, an aide,

15:13.589 --> 15:15.022
going around
saying she's sleeping with him.

15:15.124 --> 15:16.091
- Is she?
- Liv.

15:16.192 --> 15:19.594
Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky.
John Edwards, Rielle Hunter. Is she?

15:19.730 --> 15:21.425
No. You know him, he's not that guy.

15:21.799 --> 15:23.289
I need you to shut her down.

15:25.769 --> 15:28.364
- I need to see him.
- Liv, that's not possible.

15:28.473 --> 15:29.440
If you want me to shut her down,

15:29.541 --> 15:31.509
then I need to look him in the eye
and know he's not lying.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.302
He's not...

15:33.411 --> 15:35.777
Look, the man's schedule is insane.
He has no time to see you.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.507
He wants the favor.

15:37.749 --> 15:40.776
He wants my services.
I do not work for him anymore.

15:41.020 --> 15:44.751
So, you tell the President
of the United States to make time.

15:54.801 --> 15:55.995
- You're going?
- I'm going.

15:56.103 --> 15:58.299
- To Camp David.
- I won't be gone long.

15:58.406 --> 16:00.874
You're going to Camp David
to meet with the President, why?

16:00.975 --> 16:03.535
Meeting at the White House
is too official. Press is there.

16:03.644 --> 16:06.204
He wants you to take your old job back,
doesn't he? He's wooing you.

16:06.314 --> 16:08.306
He's not wooing me. We're friends.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.885
You and I are friends.
He's the leader of the free world.

16:11.019 --> 16:12.748
Your life makes me feel unsuccessful.

16:12.855 --> 16:16.916
Stay on Sully. Text me
if anything happens. I'll be back soon.

16:17.025 --> 16:20.587
Hey. Should I really do it?

16:20.697 --> 16:21.721
Yes.

16:21.831 --> 16:23.264
I'm talking about asking Georgia
to marry me.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.458
- Yes.
- Because I was thinking

16:24.567 --> 16:25.932
I'd buy the ring today,
but now with Sully...

16:26.035 --> 16:28.231
Stephen, do you want me to talk you
into it or out of it?

16:28.339 --> 16:31.775
Into it. Out of it. No. Into it.

16:31.876 --> 16:33.036
Normal lives. That's the dream.

16:33.144 --> 16:35.408
You love her, she loves you.
Normal people get married.

16:35.513 --> 16:36.776
You won't even date.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.440
I'm not normal.

16:49.829 --> 16:52.195
Huck finally managed
to hack Paige's e-mail.

16:52.298 --> 16:53.822
I've been reading them
and I think I found something.

16:53.933 --> 16:56.094
Paige sent an e-mail to a friend,
Ariel Masse.

16:56.202 --> 16:57.727
On the night of the murder,
they were supposed to attend

16:57.838 --> 16:59.669
- an embassy party together.
- So, why didn't she go?

16:59.773 --> 17:01.297
I don't know.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.933
Don't ever say, "I don't know. "
Olivia doesn't believe in "I don't know. "

17:04.044 --> 17:06.012
She asks you why,
you better have an answer. Abby!

17:09.684 --> 17:12.175
Yeah, Paige and I were supposed to go
to the French Consulate dinner.

17:12.287 --> 17:13.948
- What happened?
- She called at the last minute

17:14.055 --> 17:15.920
and she canceled. No big deal.

17:16.025 --> 17:18.016
Ariel, if there's something
you're not telling me...

17:18.127 --> 17:20.391
Look, you have to understand.
Paige loved Sully.

17:20.930 --> 17:24.366
She used to be, we both used to be,
you know, party girls.

17:24.767 --> 17:28.363
Always out, always with a different guy.
And then Paige met Sully

17:28.472 --> 17:31.202
and she just settled down with him,
you know.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.675
It made her family really happy.
They were amazing together.

17:36.247 --> 17:38.238
Oh, I just can't believe
she's dead.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.680
Ariel, you can cry.
That's understandable.

17:40.785 --> 17:41.843
But it's not going to make me go away.

17:43.788 --> 17:44.880
What aren't you telling me?

17:48.126 --> 17:49.855
<i>In other news,
White House Press Secretary</i>

17:49.962 --> 17:51.657
<i>Joyce Armstrong
is saying that, as of now,</i>

17:51.763 --> 17:54.254
<i>President Grant will issue no comment
regarding war hero</i>

17:54.433 --> 17:56.197
<i>Sullivan St, James'
possible involvement</i>

17:56.302 --> 17:57.326
<i>- in the murder of socialite...
- Olivia Pope.</i>

17:57.604 --> 17:58.866
<i>...Paige Montgomery,</i>

17:59.405 --> 18:00.599
He'll be right with you.

18:02.175 --> 18:03.699
Hi, hello, how are you?

18:03.977 --> 18:05.809
Better.
They're here, be out in a moment.

18:05.913 --> 18:07.710
The First Lady came.
She knows about this?

18:08.015 --> 18:09.482
It's not like during the election, Liv.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.140
The isolation of the White House
bonded them.

18:11.285 --> 18:12.343
The marriage is stronger than ever.

18:12.987 --> 18:14.477
- Liv!
- Mellie.

18:15.257 --> 18:17.418
- You never call, you never write.
- Well, you're a little busy.

18:18.894 --> 18:20.361
How are the kids?

18:20.462 --> 18:22.191
Jerry's adjusting
to White House life pretty well,

18:22.297 --> 18:24.026
but Karen, she misses her friends,

18:24.132 --> 18:26.101
hates the Secret Service. How are you?

18:26.569 --> 18:27.558
Are you dating anybody?

18:27.670 --> 18:29.365
Because there's this guy
at Council's Office,

18:29.472 --> 18:30.530
I think you'd really hit it off with.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.073
I'm good. Really. Thank you.

18:32.174 --> 18:33.573
Livvie.

18:33.876 --> 18:36.038
- Mr. President.
- It's good to see you.

18:39.182 --> 18:41.878
I know you've got your hands full
with the Sully St. James thing.

18:42.185 --> 18:45.747
I can't thank you enough
for taking this on.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.721
Her name is Amanda Tanner.

18:47.825 --> 18:51.818
She's 27.
I've got rumors she might be talking.

18:52.897 --> 18:55.458
And you can't fire her.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.934
Not without a nightmare on our hands.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.868
Look. As yet
she hasn't gone to the press.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.496
I'd like to put a stop to it
before she does.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.631
It's not right.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.309
It makes me look like a dirty old man.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.112
I have to ask...

19:06.212 --> 19:07.236
No.

19:08.048 --> 19:11.814
I never. I would never. No.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.915
You've known me a long time.
Longer than most.

19:16.023 --> 19:17.854
You know I did not fall
for some young girl.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.354
You know
there's only one person I love.

19:20.461 --> 19:21.985
Mellie and Fitz are happy together, Liv.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.891
He'd have no reason to cheat.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.002
I'll handle it.

19:28.704 --> 19:29.671
Consider it handled.

19:30.272 --> 19:31.330
You should come back
to the White House.

19:32.407 --> 19:33.636
We need you on our side.

19:33.843 --> 19:35.538
I like working for myself.

19:36.079 --> 19:38.240
But I've never left your side.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.050
The band is back together.

19:45.022 --> 19:45.989
Where are we?

19:46.256 --> 19:47.883
Waiting on forensics
on the gun to come in.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.452
Paige is a whore!

19:50.761 --> 19:53.059
She was screwing some guy
named Tom Henderson!

19:53.331 --> 19:54.730
She canceled on the embassy party

19:54.866 --> 19:57.357
to meet up with him!
We have another viable suspect!

19:57.469 --> 19:59.437
Paige is a whore!

19:59.537 --> 20:02.165
I'm gonna run down Henderson,
see if I can make something stick.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.673
Quinn, I need you to find out
everything you can

20:04.777 --> 20:05.903
about an Amanda Tanner.

20:06.012 --> 20:07.980
You have an hour
and then I need you to come with me.

20:12.451 --> 20:13.419
Impress her.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.155
- Can I ask...
- You're acting as my witness.

20:20.327 --> 20:22.488
Just stay by my side,
don't say anything.

20:27.969 --> 20:30.437
Cute dog. Golden retriever?

20:30.538 --> 20:33.531
Yeah. His name's Thomas Jefferson.

20:33.676 --> 20:36.509
Which is lame, I know,
but he's very presidential.

20:36.612 --> 20:38.102
Aren't you, TJ?

20:39.948 --> 20:41.210
Amanda, it would be a mistake to think

20:41.316 --> 20:43.751
there will be no consequences
to you telling lies about the President.

20:45.522 --> 20:47.547
How do you know my name?
Who are you?

20:47.757 --> 20:49.782
My name is Olivia Pope.
And I want to be clear,

20:49.926 --> 20:52.395
I'm not here in any official capacity.
I'm only here to warn you,

20:52.496 --> 20:54.293
because you should know
what could happen.

20:54.398 --> 20:56.525
It could become hard for you
to find employment,

20:56.667 --> 20:57.759
your face would be everywhere.

20:58.002 --> 20:59.902
People would associate you
with a sex scandal.

21:00.004 --> 21:02.997
All kinds of information about you would
easily become available to the press.

21:03.108 --> 21:06.407
For example, you've had
22 sexual partners that we know of.

21:06.745 --> 21:08.406
Also there's that ugly bout of gonorrhea.

21:09.081 --> 21:11.072
And your family,
your mother's mental illness,

21:11.183 --> 21:13.379
a psychotic break,
two years at Bedford Hospital.

21:13.519 --> 21:15.953
I bet that's private.
She runs a daycare now, right?

21:16.089 --> 21:19.490
He told me he loved me.
He gave me this dog.

21:19.592 --> 21:21.959
See, it's those kind of lies
that could hurt you

21:22.062 --> 21:25.156
if you said them to other people.
People not as nice as me.

21:25.566 --> 21:28.330
I'll give you some free advice.
Hand in your resignation.

21:28.502 --> 21:32.200
And pack up your dog and your things,
get in your car and go.

21:32.340 --> 21:35.332
Find a small city. Minneapolis, maybe.
Or Denver.

21:35.610 --> 21:39.011
Get a little job, meet a boring boy,
make some friends.

21:39.114 --> 21:41.515
Because, in this town,
your career is over.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.613
You're done.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.086
Why are you doing this
to me? I'm a good person.

21:47.456 --> 21:49.981
You know who else was a good person?
Monica Lewinsky.

21:50.292 --> 21:53.023
And she was telling the truth.
But she still got destroyed.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.732
If you get subpoenaed
in front of a grand jury,

21:58.869 --> 22:01.964
you can testify as an officer of the court
that I was working on my own.

22:02.273 --> 22:03.797
I didn't blackmail or threaten her.

22:04.075 --> 22:06.236
If you don't get subpoenaed,
this never happened.

22:10.314 --> 22:11.577
It's handled.

22:25.899 --> 22:28.595
Are you crying?

22:28.701 --> 22:30.363
- This is the ladies' room.
- Are you crying?

22:30.471 --> 22:31.836
- No.
- Yes, you are.

22:31.939 --> 22:33.839
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

22:35.910 --> 22:38.640
Fine. I'm crying.

22:38.746 --> 22:39.906
Well, don't let Olivia see you doing that.

22:41.082 --> 22:43.312
She doesn't believe in crying.

22:43.418 --> 22:46.512
She doesn't believe in...
What is that? Who says that?

22:46.788 --> 22:48.585
Olivia. She says that.

22:49.926 --> 22:51.257
Can I ask you,

22:52.028 --> 22:53.290
why did she hire me?

22:53.396 --> 22:56.729
She must get 100 résumés, why me?
What about me?

22:56.833 --> 22:57.800
What about me says,

22:57.900 --> 23:00.802
"Stand next to me while I decimate
a girl walking her dog?"

23:03.006 --> 23:05.998
You're here because you worship her,
you wanna be her,

23:06.109 --> 23:08.202
you think if you're near her,
if you stand in her light,

23:08.312 --> 23:11.282
then you'll finally do stuff that matters.

23:11.382 --> 23:13.179
Because you need to believe
that there's something greater

23:13.284 --> 23:17.380
than a nine-to-five crap job,
that there's a higher purpose,

23:17.488 --> 23:18.978
that your life has meaning,

23:19.090 --> 23:24.119
because the world feels big
and you feel lost. Am I right?

23:28.100 --> 23:30.262
Olivia Pope fixes things.
That's who she is.

23:30.370 --> 23:33.305
You need fixing. I don't know your story,
I don't need to know.

23:33.406 --> 23:38.309
We all have a story.
Everyone in this office needs fixing.

23:38.411 --> 23:40.880
You're a stray dog.
And Olivia took you in.

23:41.182 --> 23:42.706
Don't question it.

23:44.886 --> 23:46.979
No crying. We don't cry.

23:47.521 --> 23:48.488
Ever.

23:49.491 --> 23:50.685
<i>The President
and the First Lady are</i>

23:50.792 --> 23:52.384
<i>just now returning to the White House,</i>

23:52.494 --> 23:54.052
<i>where tonight
they will be hosting a state dinner</i>

23:54.162 --> 23:55.561
<i>for President Sarkozy
and the French First Lady,</i>

23:56.765 --> 23:58.734
<i>Even though many
see this as a positive move</i>

23:58.835 --> 24:00.826
<i>in relations between the two countries,
opposition...</i>

24:00.937 --> 24:03.064
<i>Cyrus Beene,
- Put him on. I just need a second.</i>

24:04.274 --> 24:06.139
<i>Olivia needs you,</i>

24:06.276 --> 24:07.300
<i>Hi, Liv,</i>

24:07.410 --> 24:08.571
Did you buy her a dog?

24:08.946 --> 24:11.744
<i>- What?
- Just answer the question.</i>

24:12.049 --> 24:14.017
<i>No, Of course not, Why do you ask?</i>

24:14.118 --> 24:16.416
Do me a favor.
Turn your head a little to the left.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.560
Okay. Sorry. Forget I asked.
Thank you, Mr. President.

24:26.865 --> 24:30.063
Sully's on the crawl
on the big three cable news stations.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.364
All over Drudge.
Network news is still hours away,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.632
but Diane Sawyer's already sniffing.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.332
I've got good, I've got bad, I've got ugly.

24:36.442 --> 24:37.967
The good,
Tom Henderson spilled his guts

24:38.078 --> 24:40.774
the minute I leaned on him.
Bad, he has an airtight alibi.

24:40.881 --> 24:43.042
He was working as a bouncer at a club
at the time of the murder,

24:43.150 --> 24:44.378
100 witnesses.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.451
Ugly?

24:45.552 --> 24:48.078
Henderson claims that Sully knew
he was sleeping with his girlfriend.

24:48.623 --> 24:50.420
- Which gives Sully motive.
- Even uglier.

24:50.525 --> 24:53.289
The gun found in the murder
has Sully's prints all over it.

24:53.628 --> 24:55.220
- Which gives him means.
- Damn it!

24:58.600 --> 25:00.500
Did you know Paige was sleeping
with Tom Henderson?

25:01.103 --> 25:03.333
- What?
- Did you know?

25:03.672 --> 25:05.299
I hired you.
You can't come in here and...

25:05.407 --> 25:07.341
Yes, she can.
She can do whatever the hell she wants

25:07.444 --> 25:09.878
because without her,
you are definitely going to jail.

25:10.547 --> 25:12.242
My guess is 20 years,
but if they get fancy,

25:12.615 --> 25:15.243
a life sentence is a possibility.
Is that what you want?

25:15.352 --> 25:17.753
Did you know Paige was sleeping
with Tom Henderson?

25:20.024 --> 25:21.889
Yeah. Yeah, I knew.

25:22.093 --> 25:23.617
Look over our statement.
Make sure it uses the words...

25:23.728 --> 25:26.026
Get me five soldiers,
preferably with bars on their uniforms,

25:26.130 --> 25:29.157
who are willing to attest to Sully's
heroism and kindness on the record.

25:29.267 --> 25:31.758
Wait, wait, I did not kill Paige.

25:33.138 --> 25:36.505
Paige, she slept around a lot before.

25:37.143 --> 25:38.269
I would have forgiven her.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.402
But I didn't kill her.
You have to believe me.

25:40.546 --> 25:43.538
Sully, your fingerprints are on the gun.

25:43.649 --> 25:45.674
That's because I picked it up
off of the floor.

25:46.452 --> 25:47.681
I am a soldier.

25:47.788 --> 25:50.484
Now, I have looked into the faces
of men as I killed them.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.286
I know what it means to take a life.

25:52.693 --> 25:55.127
I don't know how a person could do this
to someone they loved.

25:55.295 --> 25:57.662
I loved Paige. She was my best friend.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.460
I did not kill her.

26:21.091 --> 26:22.319
Find me somebody, anybody,

26:22.426 --> 26:24.257
who can say they saw Sully
at the time of the murder.

26:24.394 --> 26:25.383
Make his alibi stick.

26:25.729 --> 26:26.924
- Liv.
- I believe him.

26:27.198 --> 26:30.827
Abby, I believe him.
Go make his alibi stick.

26:30.935 --> 26:31.959
I'll get the car.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.332
In a minute.

26:33.438 --> 26:34.962
- Huck, did you talk to my guy?
- Yeah.

26:35.073 --> 26:36.041
- You got it?
- I got it.

26:37.943 --> 26:39.001
What?

26:41.847 --> 26:42.814
Open it.

26:49.456 --> 26:52.186
- They're engagement rings.
- Yes.

26:52.292 --> 26:53.316
They're engagement rings.

26:53.593 --> 26:56.062
- For getting engaged.
- They're engagement rings!

26:56.197 --> 26:59.792
Stephen, we made you a reservation.
8:00 p. m. Chez Henri.

26:59.900 --> 27:01.162
Best table.

27:01.268 --> 27:03.099
Huck already called Georgia,
she's meeting you there.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.896
Pick a ring. Marry the girl. Be normal.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.369
You can't just... You're bullying me.

27:08.477 --> 27:10.240
As long as I've known you,

27:10.345 --> 27:13.178
you've dated a series of women
I can only describe as trashy

27:13.982 --> 27:16.543
and too young for you
and most of all, stupid.

27:17.753 --> 27:21.120
Georgia is funny and fun

27:21.224 --> 27:24.318
and old enough and brilliant,

27:24.594 --> 27:26.028
and you know you want to marry her,

27:26.196 --> 27:27.458
we all know you want to marry her.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.895
So pick a damn ring already

27:28.999 --> 27:31.797
so we can go find an alibi
for Sully St. James.

27:47.453 --> 27:48.420
She'd like this one.

27:49.021 --> 27:50.716
Excellent choice.

28:01.601 --> 28:03.762
I want to see her.
She's not available.

28:03.870 --> 28:05.532
- I want to see her!
- She's not available.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.073
- Let me through.
- Amanda!

28:07.175 --> 28:08.369
I want you to give him a message.

28:08.476 --> 28:10.034
That's not appropriate.

28:10.144 --> 28:12.806
Not appropriate? Not appropriate?
You came to me.

28:12.914 --> 28:14.644
And I know he sent you,
I know you can give him a message.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.183
Stop, this conversation is over.
Please leave.

28:16.285 --> 28:18.344
I quit my job, okay? I did it.
Now please, give him a message.

28:18.453 --> 28:20.421
Marlin, take her down,
do not let her back up.

28:20.522 --> 28:21.784
I am telling the truth.

28:21.957 --> 28:23.219
I am.

28:25.929 --> 28:28.090
Time's up, Liv. I have a warrant.

28:28.198 --> 28:29.529
I still have 40 minutes.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.227
Fine. 40 minutes. And then
I want Sully St. James in handcuffs.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.931
You stay out here.
Nobody crosses this doorway.

28:36.907 --> 28:39.000
Get Abby on the phone,
tell her we've been invaded.

28:39.109 --> 28:40.076
Tell her time is up.

28:44.416 --> 28:46.384
Yeah, okay, okay. All right.

28:46.484 --> 28:48.384
I showed Sully's picture
to everyone in the bar.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.011
No one saw him the night of the murder.
And Liv's got cops in the lobby.

28:51.122 --> 28:52.589
He's finished.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.182
Maybe not.

28:59.899 --> 29:04.064
I have $500 in cash and a pizza.

29:04.171 --> 29:05.763
Howie, meet your $500 and your pizza.

29:06.073 --> 29:07.370
- Deep dish, sausage and mushroom?
- Yeah.

29:07.474 --> 29:08.668
Show me.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.935
- We have a ticking clock here, Howie.
- I'm counting.

29:14.282 --> 29:15.681
Last night.
Between 10:00 and midnight.

29:15.783 --> 29:18.047
The bank camera that points northeast,
towards Matty's Pub.

29:18.152 --> 29:20.950
Speed through. Stop!

29:21.789 --> 29:23.155
- Right there.
- Is...

29:24.593 --> 29:26.220
Is that Sully?

29:28.697 --> 29:30.221
We're gonna need a copy of that.

29:32.034 --> 29:33.366
We don't have a lot of time.

29:33.470 --> 29:36.769
The police are here.
So, I need you to listen.

29:39.209 --> 29:41.734
- What's going on?
- We were able to verify your alibi.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.777
You were?

29:45.316 --> 29:46.283
That's...

29:47.685 --> 29:48.652
That's a good thing, right?

29:49.020 --> 29:53.355
Sully, you're the most decorated hero
since the Vietnam War.

29:53.592 --> 29:56.083
You come from a family of soldiers.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.856
You make your living giving speeches
for the conservative right.

29:58.964 --> 30:03.595
And you've said over and over
Paige was your best friend.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.029
Not your lover.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.001
Your best friend.

30:26.394 --> 30:27.986
Paige knew, didn't she?

30:28.396 --> 30:30.387
She was your best friend.
She knew you were gay,

30:30.498 --> 30:33.229
- the two of you had a deal.
- You can't show that tape to anyone.

30:33.336 --> 30:34.803
I need the name of the man
you were kissing.

30:34.904 --> 30:37.338
You can't show that tape
and you can't have a name.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.169
- It's your alibi.
- No.

30:43.413 --> 30:47.008
You cannot tell people I am gay.
I am a hero.

30:49.319 --> 30:50.980
The police have a warrant
for your arrest.

30:51.088 --> 30:52.613
All due respect,
people finding out you're gay

30:52.724 --> 30:54.487
- is no big deal compared to that.
- No!

30:56.094 --> 30:57.686
I am a hero.

30:58.162 --> 31:00.562
I honor the uniform.

31:00.732 --> 31:03.429
- Sully.
- I honor the uniform!

31:09.408 --> 31:11.775
Sully? Look at me.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.107
The rules have changed.

31:14.381 --> 31:15.905
"Don't ask, don't tell" is over.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.243
That is talk!

31:17.450 --> 31:21.182
I am a conservative Republican.
I am publicly anti-gay!

31:21.288 --> 31:23.017
I am the deacon in my church.

31:23.157 --> 31:26.285
They're talking about me
running for Congress one day.

31:26.394 --> 31:30.559
I am Lieutenant Colonel
Sullivan St. James!

31:30.665 --> 31:34.431
I'm a hero. I can't be gay.

31:34.569 --> 31:36.036
But you are.

31:36.371 --> 31:39.602
This is who you are. This is your alibi.

31:39.741 --> 31:41.369
Let us help you.

31:42.645 --> 31:44.169
Come on, Sully.

31:53.056 --> 31:54.080
- No.
- Sully.

31:56.627 --> 31:57.753
Sully!

32:04.169 --> 32:07.138
Sullivan St. James,
you have the right to remain silent,

32:07.705 --> 32:10.698
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.409
You have the right to an attorney.

32:12.511 --> 32:15.105
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided to you by the court.

32:18.851 --> 32:19.841
Hey, you seen Olivia?

32:19.986 --> 32:23.649
Sully was just arrested.
Olivia went to the police station.

32:23.757 --> 32:24.724
Oh.

32:25.959 --> 32:27.119
What's up? I'm on my way there.

32:27.227 --> 32:29.696
I got a strange call.
Some girl named Amanda Tanner?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.456
- What about her?
- She's in the hospital.

32:31.566 --> 32:33.693
She tried to kill herself.

32:44.746 --> 32:46.441
Reporters are starting to gather outside.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.709
- Crap.
- Our defense attorney is with Sully now,

32:48.817 --> 32:50.251
but didn't seem optimistic.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.115
- What do we do?
- We can't use the alibi.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.416
Can we leak it?

32:53.523 --> 32:55.218
He's our client.
We have to do what he wants.

32:55.325 --> 32:56.758
I hate this.

32:58.127 --> 32:59.823
- I have to go.
- Now?

32:59.930 --> 33:01.830
It's after 6:00.
They won't arraign him until morning.

33:01.932 --> 33:06.028
I'll be back. Get in to see Sully.
See if you can change his mind.

33:08.072 --> 33:11.304
Georgia's gonna be waiting for me
at Chez Henri. I could cancel.

33:12.444 --> 33:13.468
We'll work on Sully. Go.

33:15.046 --> 33:16.104
Go!

33:16.948 --> 33:19.144
Okay. Thanks.

33:20.353 --> 33:22.981
Get down on one knee.
Women like that.

33:27.994 --> 33:29.087
What happened?

33:29.263 --> 33:30.753
She slashed her wrists.

33:30.864 --> 33:31.956
Any press sniffing around?

33:32.065 --> 33:33.965
No. No one. One of the nurses told me

33:34.067 --> 33:35.625
her dad's flying in.
He'll be here in the morning.

33:35.736 --> 33:39.264
Okay. She hasn't spoken to anyone,
no nurses or doctors about anything?

33:39.374 --> 33:41.774
- Just to me.
- Good. Stay with her.

33:42.343 --> 33:43.469
Olivia.

33:43.845 --> 33:45.369
You said to trust your gut.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.742
My gut says she's telling the truth.

33:46.848 --> 33:47.872
- She's not.
- How do you know?

33:47.983 --> 33:48.972
Because I know the President.

33:49.084 --> 33:52.315
Okay, she was going on and on and on
about how there's this secret room

33:52.421 --> 33:53.718
off of the Oval Office where they've met,

33:53.822 --> 33:56.154
and I've read about the White House.
There is a little room.

33:56.292 --> 33:57.316
If you read it, she read it.

33:57.693 --> 34:00.094
People are crazy.
They get fixated on famous people.

34:00.196 --> 34:01.720
- They stalk them.
- But I don't think she's crazy.

34:03.833 --> 34:04.857
- Tell me why.
- Okay.

34:05.235 --> 34:07.328
Because she tried to kill herself,
but she didn't wanna die.

34:07.437 --> 34:09.235
She called you right after she did it.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.864
Because she wanted him to find out
she was hurt and come see her.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.476
- She thought he would do that.
- Quinn.

34:13.578 --> 34:14.806
She was going on and on and on

34:14.911 --> 34:16.937
about how she thought he'd come
and call her "sweet baby"

34:17.047 --> 34:18.539
- and everything would be fine...
- What?

34:18.650 --> 34:20.174
What?

34:20.284 --> 34:22.844
- What did you say?
- That he'd come if she was hurt.

34:22.955 --> 34:24.149
And he would call her...

34:24.255 --> 34:26.156
"Sweet baby. " And I was just thinking

34:26.257 --> 34:29.489
that if she really thought
that if he found out...

34:38.371 --> 34:39.339
Where is he?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.271
It'll just be a moment.

34:45.245 --> 34:48.737
Stephen, I can't talk right now.
What's wrong?

34:48.850 --> 34:51.478
Okay, I'll be there. I'm coming.

34:51.585 --> 34:54.578
Maybe half an hour.
Because I'm doing something.

34:54.688 --> 34:57.215
I'm coming. I have to go.

34:57.326 --> 35:00.386
Livvie? This is a surprise.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.361
We're gonna need the room, please.

35:10.374 --> 35:12.842
Sir, you have to give the toast to
the President of France in 10 minutes.

35:13.276 --> 35:15.244
- Maybe you can find another...
- We need the room.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.017
Livvie.

35:25.923 --> 35:26.948
Sweet baby?

35:29.361 --> 35:31.022
Sweet...

35:31.130 --> 35:32.927
Sweet baby!

35:40.306 --> 35:41.773
Come here.

35:57.826 --> 35:58.815
You left me.

35:59.161 --> 36:00.423
Because you're married.

36:00.629 --> 36:03.063
Because you said you wanted to try
to dedicate yourself to your marriage!

36:03.165 --> 36:04.757
Because you are the leader
of the free world

36:04.866 --> 36:06.357
and I wanted you to be a better man.

36:06.736 --> 36:08.226
I wanted you to be the man
I campaigned for,

36:08.337 --> 36:09.895
helped get elected, and I voted for.

36:10.006 --> 36:13.134
Do not touch me. Don't touch me.
Please...

36:31.596 --> 36:32.790
Look at me.

36:33.965 --> 36:35.558
Look at me.

36:36.869 --> 36:38.166
Look at me.

36:39.939 --> 36:42.169
- Did you give her that dog?
- Livvie.

36:45.579 --> 36:47.137
Did you give her that dog?

36:47.881 --> 36:49.610
I love you.

36:56.491 --> 36:57.617
I believed you!

36:57.759 --> 36:59.090
You clouded my judgment!

36:59.193 --> 37:02.856
You made me mistrust my gut
because I wanted to believe you!

37:02.964 --> 37:06.230
I destroyed that girl!
She tried to kill herself!

37:11.774 --> 37:14.710
I just wanna say
that we can hear you screaming...

37:30.261 --> 37:33.355
Mr. President, you'll wanna go clean up.

37:33.464 --> 37:36.025
- Cy.
- No, you have lipstick on your mouth.

37:36.835 --> 37:38.632
You need to clean up.

37:48.347 --> 37:49.314
Mother of God.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.079
You didn't know.

37:56.924 --> 37:58.084
He tells you everything.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.384
Didn't tell me this.

38:00.727 --> 38:02.695
Because it didn't matter enough.

38:03.965 --> 38:06.866
- Oh, Liv, just wait.
- Don't... I have to go.

38:27.157 --> 38:28.283
Liv!

38:31.094 --> 38:33.393
You're in a coat closet.
What do you need?

38:33.531 --> 38:34.896
Did you forget the ring or something?

38:34.999 --> 38:36.762
No, I have the ring.

38:38.369 --> 38:40.860
- You can do this.
- That's the thing.

38:40.972 --> 38:42.200
I don't think I can.

38:43.075 --> 38:45.168
Tell me.

38:45.277 --> 38:48.440
You know,
what if I marry her and I cheat,

38:49.214 --> 38:52.412
or she gets bored with me
or she doesn't love me enough?

38:55.755 --> 38:59.452
I am not a good guy, Livvie.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.327
And what if she

39:02.963 --> 39:03.987
leaves me?

39:05.232 --> 39:07.132
I gotta trust my gut. And my gut is what?

39:07.468 --> 39:10.335
- Never wrong.
- Never wrong.

39:10.437 --> 39:13.271
And my gut tells me that she's in this.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.933
She's in this with you.

39:15.243 --> 39:17.507
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

39:17.612 --> 39:19.671
But you have to try.

39:19.814 --> 39:23.410
Because if you try,
if you leap and you try

39:23.519 --> 39:26.886
and it doesn't work out, it's not on you.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.458
It's not on me.

39:30.226 --> 39:31.215
You can do this.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.162
Okay.

39:34.698 --> 39:35.722
Okay.

39:37.034 --> 39:38.592
I can do this.

39:39.670 --> 39:41.605
Go. Be happy. Get some normal.

39:59.024 --> 40:04.292
Georgia, it would give me
the greatest honor...

40:34.263 --> 40:37.255
We may never know who killed Paige.

40:37.367 --> 40:40.633
But this isn't about you not going to jail
for Paige's murder.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.536
This is about you not living a lie.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.268
Sully, I saw that kiss.
You love that man.

40:46.377 --> 40:50.678
Whoever he is, you love him.

40:50.782 --> 40:56.186
You've been living with a secret
for a really long time.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.619
I know what that's like.

40:58.723 --> 41:01.625
I honestly do.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.695
And you think you're doing it
for the right reasons.

41:03.796 --> 41:05.889
You think you're doing it
for your country

41:05.998 --> 41:07.966
and for the people who look up to you.

41:08.067 --> 41:12.198
But the thing is,
who you are, who you love,

41:12.305 --> 41:14.102
that shouldn't be a secret.

41:14.207 --> 41:17.108
It shouldn't have to be a secret,
should it?

41:29.992 --> 41:30.981
John Latimer.

41:34.363 --> 41:36.524
That's his name.

41:40.070 --> 41:43.267
And I do love him.

42:09.535 --> 42:12.993
<i>I am honored
to have served my country,</i>

42:15.408 --> 42:19.072
<i>I am honored to have been injured
serving my country,</i>

42:21.682 --> 42:24.981
<i>And just as importantly,</i>

42:25.085 --> 42:28.783
<i>I am honored to be a gay man
who served my country,</i>

42:28.890 --> 42:32.053
<i>That was Sullivan
St, James, cleared of murder charges...</i>

42:32.160 --> 42:34.788
The other soldiers are a nice touch,
don't you think?

42:34.896 --> 42:37.296
<i>...soldiers standing by his side,</i>

42:38.901 --> 42:40.698
You, you have good ideas.

42:50.413 --> 42:54.213
So, Sully's innocent.
He didn't kill Paige. Then who did?

42:54.317 --> 42:56.342
- Doesn't matter.
- It matters. Just not to us.

42:56.486 --> 42:57.886
All that matters is Sully. That's the job.

42:57.989 --> 42:59.149
Look, I take all this stuff to the police.

42:59.257 --> 43:01.555
Maybe it helps them.
Finding Paige's killer is their job.

43:04.262 --> 43:06.560
- You said we were the good guys.
- We are.

43:06.664 --> 43:09.361
Really? I mean, is Olivia?
Is she one of the good guys?

43:09.468 --> 43:12.494
No. She's not one of the good guys.
She's the best guy.

43:16.308 --> 43:19.335
It's not enough to say it.
You gotta believe it.

43:21.247 --> 43:23.579
Gladiators. In suits.

43:23.683 --> 43:25.514
That's what I'm talking about.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.923
Nice work on Sully St. James.

43:38.767 --> 43:39.734
He wants to see you.

43:40.101 --> 43:41.466
Tell him to go to hell.

43:41.570 --> 43:42.935
I'm just the messenger.

43:43.805 --> 43:46.535
You tell him that he better hope to God

43:46.641 --> 43:49.805
Amanda Tanner doesn't want
to come forward with her story,

43:49.912 --> 43:52.437
because she just became my client.

43:56.519 --> 44:00.115
<i>I am honored

44:02.392 --> 44:06.351
