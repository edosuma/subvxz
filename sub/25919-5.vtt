Look, Spirit. They're taking pictures
for the wedding announcement.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.477
Lucky, how'd you like
to join us for a photo?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.395
The first portrait of our new family.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.521
You bet I would!

01:03.605 --> 01:05.065
Oh. Just a second.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.692
Lucky, I want you to have this.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.986
[Lucky gasps] Oh, wow.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.783
But that's your mom's necklace.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.243
It's all you have left of her.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.081

Of course Spirit can be in one.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.980
No way! I might lose it
while we're riding.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.191
I'm only going to wear it
on special occasions.

Oops, how did that happen?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.538
Snips, what are you doing?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.206
I'm looking for a rotten apple.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.457
I think we found one.

I'm going to string together
some shrunken heads and wear them

02:11.756 --> 02:15.051
as a way to distract
from my devilish good looks.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.847
Ew. Here, your third shrunken head.
Just take it and go!

02:18.930 --> 02:21.516
Whoa! At last, Señor Carrots!

[Mary Pat] Telegram!

02:34.112 --> 02:37.782
Lucky, it's for you.
It's from your cousin Julian.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.994
He sent it from the Dusty Rose Hotel
in Silverlode,

02:41.077 --> 02:42.662
and he needs your help.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.956
Telegrams are supposed
to be private, Mary Pat.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.541
But we just learned how to read.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.168
Soon we'll know everything about everyone.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.211
Blackmail!

02:50.295 --> 02:55.091
"In Silverlode. Please help.
Don't tell the grown-ups. Julian."

02:55.174 --> 02:58.094
Eh, it's probably just another one
of his scams.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.929
Oh! He sent this one, too.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.390
"This is not another one of my scams."

03:02.473 --> 03:05.226
Anyway,
we've got more telegrams to deliver.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.478
Winthrop's mom got new teeth!

03:07.562 --> 03:11.065
Ooh, I wonder what kind of trouble
Julian has gotten into this time.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.234
Whatever it is,
he can get himself out of it.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.194
But aren't you kind of curious?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.821
-No.
-[Lucky] You have to admit--

03:16.905 --> 03:20.283
things have been pretty dull in Miradero
with all this wedding planning.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.870
It's never dull when Julian's around.
It's exciting! And sometimes dangerous.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.205
And usually painful.
But it sure isn't dull.

03:26.289 --> 03:30.126
Come on, Pru. We've got all day.
A ride to Silverlode could be fun!

03:30.209 --> 03:32.211
-What do you think, girl?
-[neighs]

03:32.295 --> 03:34.047
[sighs] Okay, okay.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.716
But don't say I didn't warn you
when we get scammed.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.805
[Lucky] The telegram was sent
from the hotel,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.225
so Julian must be around here somewhere.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.435
-I'll find him.
-And we'll go water the horses.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.520
And then answer the age-old question:

03:49.604 --> 03:52.565
is Silverlode ice cream yummier
than Miradero ice cream?

03:53.149 --> 03:56.527
Oh, I hope not. Silverlode is awfully far
to go for ice cream.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.199
[Julian] Psst! Lucky. Psst!

04:01.282 --> 04:02.825
-[Lucky] Julian?
-[Julian] Psst!

04:04.827 --> 04:05.995
Where are you?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.039
-Aah!
-What took you so long?

04:08.122 --> 04:10.875
-Julian, what's going on?
-I need your help.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.336
Have you ever heard of the Scoundrels?

04:13.419 --> 04:14.754
-The who?
-The Scoundrels!

04:14.837 --> 04:17.089
[scoffs] Only the best secret club around,

04:17.173 --> 04:19.341
which is exactly why
you haven't heard of them.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.468
They have their own handshake,

04:20.551 --> 04:22.720
and you need a password
to get into their clubhouse,

04:22.804 --> 04:26.474
and no one ever became a titan of industry
without being a Scoundrel first.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.560
There's a chapter at my school,
and I want to join.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.145
So? Join!

04:31.229 --> 04:34.941
Thing is, to get in, they make you
do these really fun rituals.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.443
Kissing a pig, wearing a dress to class--

04:37.527 --> 04:38.486
You wore a dress?

04:38.569 --> 04:39.696
And I looked gorgeous.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.907
But for the final test,
they want me and the other pledge

04:42.991 --> 04:45.201
to sneak
into the headmaster's house tonight

04:45.285 --> 04:47.870
to nab an old map for the clubhouse wall.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.832
But if I get caught,
I'll get kicked out of school for sure.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.250
Seriously?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.711
We rode here to help you get into a club?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.922
I thought somehow the trouble
you were in would be... exciting!

04:58.006 --> 04:59.674
Oh, it's gonna be exciting!

04:59.757 --> 05:01.759
-Because I'm gonna rob you.
-What?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.052
[snorts]

05:03.136 --> 05:04.846
I need a trophy for the club.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.015
So I'll convince the pledge master

05:07.098 --> 05:10.768
that there's something way more amazing
than a map to nab at your house--

05:10.852 --> 05:13.021
something you and I will plant.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.731
And then I'll take it!

05:14.814 --> 05:17.859
So you want to steal something
without really stealing.

05:17.942 --> 05:18.943
Exactly.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.157
This is just like Boxcar Bonnie
and the Dastardly Double-Deal.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.533
Oh, it's so good.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.286
Bonnie convinces some thieves
they're stealing a priceless diamond,

05:28.369 --> 05:31.497
-but, really, it's just a chunk of ice!
-Huh?

05:31.581 --> 05:34.292
It was winter. Okay, we're in.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.335
-Wait, you're in?
-[Calvin] Who's in, Prescott?

05:37.211 --> 05:39.630
[Julian] Hey! What do you know?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.007
Look at that.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.510
It's my pledge master Calvin
and my fellow pledge Pete.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.430
-Who's your friend?
-Yeah, Prescott, who's your friend?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.349
-This is my--
-Cohort in capers, Fortuna Navarro.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.268
They call me Sticky Fingers.

05:52.351 --> 05:56.272
And this is my trusty steed Sp-- Spunky.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.690
[whinnies]

05:57.774 --> 06:00.610
[scoffs] What kind of capers
do you and Julian have going?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.487
Devious ones.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.489
Like the one
we were gonna pull off tonight.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.699
Julian was gonna get me
into the house of his cousin,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.452
Lucky the Railroad Heiress,
but now he's putting me off

06:09.535 --> 06:11.704
because you want
to steal some dumb map?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.582
"Dumb"? [chuckles] Is that so?

06:16.459 --> 06:18.127
Yeah, is that so?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.587
It's small potatoes!

06:19.670 --> 06:22.673
There's a much more valuable prize
inside the cousin's house.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.050
That should be your target.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.552
-What kind of prize?
-Is it potatoes?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.388
It's... amazing.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.600
And you'll be... amazed.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.227
It's, uh...

06:36.604 --> 06:38.106
A string of shrunken heads!

06:38.189 --> 06:39.273
-Oh.
-[spits]

06:39.357 --> 06:42.902
Lucky's dad's an adventurer who stole them
from a band of headhunters

06:42.985 --> 06:45.822
and nearly got his own head shrunk
in the process.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.824
But he escaped, and after tonight,

06:47.907 --> 06:49.951
he's taking them back to the city
with him.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.829
Shrunken heads?
That'll beat a map any day.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.624
[laughs] I can see 'em now,
hanging around the neck of old Bartleby.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.043
That's the club mascot. He's a moose head.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.962
Bartleby deserves something nice.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.880
I was thinking the same thing, Calvin.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.341
Sticky here was saying we get in,
grab the heads

07:05.424 --> 07:07.051
and get out before anyone sees us.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.386
Clean and simple.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.263
Yeah, clean and simple!

07:10.346 --> 07:11.556
Once Julian gets us

07:11.639 --> 07:14.434
into the big party his spoiled cousin
is throwing tonight.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.521
Hmm. You two knuckleheads
will be full-fledged Scoundrels.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.064
[chuckles]

07:20.940 --> 07:22.191
[Julian groans softly]

07:22.275 --> 07:25.653
All right, spill it.
What's Julian's scheme this time?

07:25.736 --> 07:30.241
Julian doesn't have a scheme,
but Sticky Fingers here sure does.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.785
It was supposed to be a simple plan,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.663
but now it has guests and music
and light refreshments!

07:35.746 --> 07:38.207
Clearly you're not a Boxcar Bonnie fan.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.751
All the best heists happen
at dinner parties.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.420
Oh! We're having a party?

07:42.503 --> 07:46.841
Something way more fun than a party.
Pals, we're pulling a con of our own!

07:46.924 --> 07:50.803
Hold on. You roped Julian
into one of your schemes?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.972
-Ha! Count me in!
-Me too!

07:53.055 --> 07:54.265
Well, count me out!

07:54.348 --> 07:56.350
You've got a major problem, genius.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.562
In your plan, Lucky Prescott's
the one throwing the party.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.648
But they've seen you,
so how's that gonna work?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.151
We can get someone to play me!

08:05.234 --> 08:06.486
[Maricela] I'm honored!

08:06.569 --> 08:10.323
Lucky Prescott,
heiress to a railroad fortune.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.283
It'll be the role of a lifetime!

08:12.366 --> 08:16.120
But do I play you as you are,
or do I play you as you ought to be,

08:16.204 --> 08:19.123
with poise and class and je ne sais quoi?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.625
I vote for me as me.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.336
You're right.
I'll let the muses be my guide.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.005
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.967
"Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.178
Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,

08:32.260 --> 08:33.721
-seized his knees and sneezed..."
-[door opens and closes]

08:33.804 --> 08:35.932
Maybe I'll just drop out of school now,

08:36.015 --> 08:39.559
save the Scoundrels the trouble of having
to string me up the flagpole tomorrow.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.647
Julian, you'll be a Scoundrel
before the day is over.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.563
Trust me.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.360
Okay, pals, now that we have our Lucky,
it's time for the rest of the plan.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.905
First, we need a safe.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.951
[grunts]

08:55.034 --> 08:56.160
Whoa.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.663
Next, we need Turo to fix the safe.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.582
And I know exactly what
we'll use as shrunken heads.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.085
Wait, you want to use apples?

09:04.168 --> 09:07.255
Not just apples. Rotten apples.

Oh, that rotten Snips took them all!

09:19.016 --> 09:20.518
I'll handle this.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.855
[snoring]

09:24.939 --> 09:27.024
[softly] Ah...

09:27.108 --> 09:29.777
[sleepily] What a lovely hat,
Señor Carrots.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.822
-Ugh.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.199

09:35.283 --> 09:36.617

09:36.701 --> 09:38.786

-[Julian] Yeah!

09:38.869 --> 09:40.204
Eep!

09:40.871 --> 09:41.998

09:52.633 --> 09:55.303
When we're done doctoring the apples,

09:55.386 --> 09:58.264
those know-nothings
will never be able to tell.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.273
[Lucky] Now that we've got
the house to ourselves,

10:07.356 --> 10:09.483
let's get ready to get those Scoundrels.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.028
-[Jim laughs]
-They're still here!

10:12.111 --> 10:13.946
[sighs] We're cutting it close.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.323
[Abigail] What do we do?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.534
[both laugh]

10:19.952 --> 10:23.497
[grunts] Miss Flores,
you have two left feet.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.624
Ooh! [laughs]

10:24.707 --> 10:27.460
Well, then, Mr. Prescott,
you must have two right ones.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.962
Kind of makes us a perfect match,
don't you think?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.631
-[both chuckle]
-[Lucky] Uh...

10:31.714 --> 10:33.299
If you keep Aunt Cora waiting,

10:33.382 --> 10:35.843
your dance lesson will turn
into a "being on time" lesson.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.220
You're right. Be back in two hours.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.014
[Kate] Bye, girls.

10:42.016 --> 10:42.892
-Have fun!
-Safe dancing!

10:42.975 --> 10:44.018
[train whistle blows]

10:44.101 --> 10:45.936
Just in time. There's the train whistle.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.939
Turo and Maricela should be here
any minute with the snacks.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.566
We'll get the house ready.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.402
Me and Spirit will meet Julian
and the Scoundrels at the depot.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.489
This is it, pals.
Our first con! Good luck!

-All set, pledge master.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.792
-Hiya, Spunky.
-[snorts]

11:07.875 --> 11:09.752
The pieces are in place.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.879
Maybe this scheme is gonna work after all.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.547
Of course it's going to work.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.466
What could possibly go wrong?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.223
-Here we go, boy.
-[neighs]

11:25.893 --> 11:27.645

11:28.312 --> 11:29.563
Turo.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.649
Welcome, Julian...

11:31.732 --> 11:35.569
-[stutters] ...and his friends.
-[Calvin] Ready, fellas?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.696
This is gonna be a night to remember.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.074
-[Turo] Can I take your coat, sir?
-[Calvin] Thanks, sport.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.867
Indubitably.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.456
Lucky will join us moments... tarily.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.166
Did someone call for me?

11:50.126 --> 11:54.547
Enchantée, Cousin Julian!
How delightful to see you!

11:54.630 --> 11:55.881
[kisses]

11:56.006 --> 11:57.466
Lucky, you look lovely.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.428
Oh, forgive my rumpled appearance,

12:00.511 --> 12:04.181
but I have just returned
from riding my horse wildly about.

12:04.265 --> 12:08.269
It may be base, but I do love it so.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.939
Allow me to introduce some friends
from school. Calvin and Pete.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.399
Nice to meet you.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.693
Enchantée. Enchantée.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.028
And this is Sticky Fingers Navarro.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.738
Sticky Fingers?

12:19.822 --> 12:23.742
Well, there's soap and water out back
if you care to wash your hands.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.621
[laughs, snorts]

12:27.705 --> 12:29.582
Won't you meet my doting admirers?

12:29.665 --> 12:32.585
[growls] Hi, y'all! I'm Maricela!

12:32.668 --> 12:36.672
My daddy's the mayor, but I work
at the ramada, mucking out the stalls.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.215
-[growls]
-[Pru] Put 'er there.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.383
[Pete] Hiya!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
And I'm Mary Pat!

12:41.260 --> 12:43.637
I have a twin sister Bianca.
I'll go get her.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.769
[dishes clattering]

12:50.853 --> 12:52.480
Hi, I'm Bianca.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.482
I'm the one who wears blue boots.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.947
-[chuckles nervously]
-[mutters] What are you doing?

13:02.031 --> 13:05.451
[quietly] I don't know! Everybody's being
everybody else, and I panicked!

13:05.534 --> 13:07.203
Hoo-whee! [chuckles]

13:07.286 --> 13:10.998
I came straight from the barn
smelling like horses and hard work.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.626
[sighs] Classic Maricela!

13:13.709 --> 13:16.086
Oh! Pâtisserie?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.671
Mmm!

13:17.755 --> 13:18.923

13:19.006 --> 13:23.093
Let us all move into the sitting room
and enjoy some delicious refreshments.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.011
Come along.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.223
[Maricela] Oh, such a night we'll have.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.226
Can I get anyone a glass of...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.102
lemonade?

13:33.687 --> 13:34.522
No?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.944
The safe's in the dining room.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.155
Pete, you keep the heiress yakking.
We'll go crack the safe.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.282
-But I want to do some rob--
-Eat a croissant, Pete.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.285
You'll be delighted to know
I've prepared a poetry reading.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.872
Whoa!

13:52.748 --> 13:54.583
All right, here we go.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.711
No safe is safe
from my safecracking skills.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.588
This lock is a piece of cake.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.924
Cracked more than a couple of these
in my early days.

14:02.007 --> 14:02.967
[lock clicks open]

14:03.050 --> 14:05.678
And that's why they call me
Sticky Fingers.

14:05.761 --> 14:09.640
Prepare to be awed and amazed
by genuine shrunken heads!

14:12.142 --> 14:14.687
-[chuckles nervously]
-Uh...

14:14.770 --> 14:19.441
Okay. No problem. [chuckles]
We'll just find another way to crack it.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.777
[snoring]

14:21.861 --> 14:25.030

14:25.114 --> 14:28.367
Awake, gallant slumberer! [giggles]

14:28.450 --> 14:32.705
Stop it, Señor Carrots.
I told you I had a bath last week.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.999
-[giggles]
-[gasps] Yuck!

14:35.082 --> 14:39.628
My shrunken heads are supposed
to repel you and your vile smoochin'!

14:39.712 --> 14:43.299
Snips, there's nothing shrunken
about your big head.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.800

14:45.968 --> 14:47.511
Huh? Ah!

14:47.595 --> 14:50.139

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
We're defenseless, Señor Carrots.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.726
Run for your life!

14:53.809 --> 14:55.769

14:55.853 --> 14:57.021
[Mary Pat] Hmm.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.650
[Maricela] "...and a broken heart's
most sorrowful sighs."

15:02.651 --> 15:03.611
Oh!

15:04.194 --> 15:07.239
Perhaps Pete would care
to hear another poem?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.742
Ooh, "The Girl So Fair
with Her Lustrous Hair"

15:09.825 --> 15:11.368
is a personal favorite.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.495
"There was a girl so fair,

15:13.579 --> 15:16.665
-with her lustrous hair..."
-[Pru] Aw, phooey!

15:16.749 --> 15:20.669
I bet Pete wants to hear about the time
I won the pig-rasslin' contest.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.963
Another Maricela gasser.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.258
-Uh... tea cakes?
-[Maricela] Excuse me!

15:26.342 --> 15:27.426
-I was reciting.
-[Turo] Oh!

15:27.509 --> 15:30.554
Uh... excuse me.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.597
Ugh!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.766
Safe's busted. We're not getting in.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.393
Guess we got to hit
the headmaster's house after all.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.605
No! I mean, let's take a look
in Lucky's room.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.942
She's got a treasure trove of trophies
for us to liberate.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.234
Follow me!

15:45.694 --> 15:47.571
Mary Pat, what are we gonna do?

15:47.655 --> 15:51.158
Bianca, there's only one thing we can do.
We have to warn Lucky.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.160
Good thinking, Mary Pat. Let's go.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.245
No, you're Mary Pat. I'm Bianca.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.956
[groans] This is so hard!

15:59.249 --> 16:01.627
-[snorts]
-[sighs] Know anything about safes, boy?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.838
Sticky! Mary Pat and Bianca just heard
Julian and the Scoundrels!

16:04.922 --> 16:07.174
They're going to take something
from your room as a trophy

16:07.257 --> 16:08.884
instead of the shrunken heads.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.762
Ugh! Even when Julian and me are
on the same side,

16:11.845 --> 16:13.806
I end up losing my stuff! [sighs]

16:13.889 --> 16:17.267
Have Turo get the safe open.
I'll check on the Scoundrels.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.689
Hi, Spirit. It's really me-- Abigail.
Don't tell anyone.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.900
[neighs]

16:24.984 --> 16:25.985
Eh?

16:30.406 --> 16:32.199
[Calvin] Face it, Pete.
This place is a bust.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.993
[Pete] This quartz is nice and shiny.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.202
-[Julian] Uh...
-[gasps]

16:35.285 --> 16:38.414
-Or what about this snow globe, Calvin?
-No, not those!

16:38.497 --> 16:42.543
What we need is something that the guys
back at the club will remember us by--

16:42.626 --> 16:46.046
something amazing, something like, uh...

16:46.130 --> 16:48.215
-[necklace rattling]
-Genius idea, Pete!

16:48.298 --> 16:50.551
How hilarious would
this dainty necklace look

16:50.634 --> 16:53.303
dangling from the neck
of our old mascot Bartleby?

16:53.387 --> 16:56.098
Ha! Well, well, Pete saves the day.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.391
Hee-haw, Prescott!

16:57.474 --> 16:59.435
All right. Now I'm hungry.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.645
Let's go get some of those croissants.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.857
-What's going on?
-Don't worry, RF.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.858
They were eyeing
your snow globe and your quartz,

17:06.942 --> 17:08.569
but I handled it.

17:08.652 --> 17:09.653
You're welcome.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.324
Huh?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.368
[gasps]

17:18.537 --> 17:21.330
My necklace! Did you take my necklace?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.041
I have to get it back!

17:23.125 --> 17:25.502
I thought it was okay.
I've never seen you wear it.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.714
It belonged to Kate's mother.
She just gave it to me.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.467
We have to stop all of this
and tell Calvin the truth.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.343
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not be hasty.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.429
-Julian!
-Okay, okay.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.973
We can get it back
and get me into the Scoundrels.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.308
I have a plan.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.352
Or I will by the time I get
to the bottom of these stairs.

-[whispers indistinctly]
-Come on, Julian.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.609
-We got what we need.
-We can't go yet.

-[square dance music playing]
-That's right!

18:00.037 --> 18:04.041
We got us a square dance.
Maricela loves a good square dance.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.085
That's me! Now, grab your partners.

Your cousin and her friends are crazy.
Let's get out of here.

-This always happens with allemande!

20:08.040 --> 20:09.708
Scoundrels, let's go!

20:10.417 --> 20:13.670
[Pete] Let's go to the headmaster's house
and find those potatoes.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.588
Wait for me!

I mean, Spirit.
I'm trying to help Sticky--

Calvin! Calvin, hey, wait!
Hold on a minute!

20:30.145 --> 20:32.481
-I need that necklace.
-Don't worry. I've got it.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.650
No, I mean, I need to give it back.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.109
It belongs to Lucky.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.028
I thought that was Lucky.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.656
No, that's Maricela. And that's Pru.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.866
I'm Abigail. Both of me are.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.618
Prescott, what's going on?

20:44.701 --> 20:47.871
I just wanted to prove I belong
in the Scoundrels.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.582
But I needed a new target,
and Lucky invented the story

20:50.666 --> 20:53.794
about the shrunken heads,
which, even though it's crazy, you bought.

20:53.877 --> 20:58.382
Except we took the necklace and it means
a whole lot to her. I didn't know.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.926
If you have to,
you can string me up the flagpole.

21:01.009 --> 21:01.927
I don't care.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.721
But I do care about my cousin,
so hand it over, Calvin.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.390
Let me get this straight.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.435
The shrunken heads, this party,
it was all a setup?

21:10.978 --> 21:14.189
You... scammed the Scoundrels?

21:17.192 --> 21:20.654
Boy, that's a true Scoundrel move!

21:20.737 --> 21:22.823
Consider yourself in, Prescott.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.284
-Really?
-Does that mean I'm in, too?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.119
Can it, Pete.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.748
-[sighs] Thanks.
-[Turo] I did it!

21:31.832 --> 21:33.000
