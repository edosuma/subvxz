00:02.346 --> 00:05.405
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all about

00:05.427 --> 00:08.226
knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:09.288 --> 00:12.207
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.208 --> 00:14.327
sending prices sky-high,

00:14.328 --> 00:16.607
literally, literally

00:16.608 --> 00:19.687
taking the grass from its own roots.

00:19.688 --> 00:22.567
And now you've got
your condemnation.

00:22.568 --> 00:26.247
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:26.248 --> 00:29.087
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?!

00:29.088 --> 00:31.127
Is revolution a word?

00:31.128 --> 00:32.967
Or was it never?

00:32.968 --> 00:34.687
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:34.688 --> 00:38.927
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:38.928 --> 00:42.247
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:42.248 --> 00:45.127
and they charge us for water!

00:45.128 --> 00:47.327
I wandered lonely as a clown,

00:47.328 --> 00:49.767
necking mushrooms rarely found,

00:49.768 --> 00:53.527
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:53.528 --> 00:56.127
yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:56.128 --> 00:59.407
It's not theirs any more.

00:59.408 --> 01:01.927
This is our England now!

01:01.928 --> 01:03.567
Party!

'Like it or not,

01:20.862 --> 01:23.821
'competition
is the marrow in our bones.

01:23.892 --> 01:26.611
'Without it, everything stagnates.

01:26.612 --> 01:30.732
'People, communities, society,
everything.'

01:33.652 --> 01:35.851
'As soon as you stop competing,

01:35.852 --> 01:39.571
'if you rest on your laurels,

refuse to retire.

'Work on until 70 and 80 and 85.

'Because, if they stop competing,
they'll die.

individually and collectively.

'It's in our DNA.'

02:05.932 --> 02:07.531
Fuck's sake, Shane!

02:07.532 --> 02:10.091
They won't be here long.
We'll get shot of them no sweat.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.651
Or they'll be here for a while,

02:11.652 --> 02:13.691
because we've got no chance
of shifting them.

02:13.692 --> 02:15.931
I thought you were
flogging them locally?

02:15.932 --> 02:18.210
Everyone who wants one has got one,
sometimes two.

02:18.211 --> 02:20.052
People are using them
as patio furniture.

02:20.053 --> 02:22.091
Supply and demand, Jackson.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.932
There's a world
beyond the Chatsworth.

02:23.933 --> 02:26.771
I just want them out my fucking yard!
Makes us a target!

02:26.772 --> 02:28.052
His objection's political.

02:28.053 --> 02:29.171
No, it's not!

02:29.172 --> 02:32.611
Doesn't like robbing from the nice
people in the nice houses, do you?

02:32.612 --> 02:34.331
I don't like robbing, period.

02:34.332 --> 02:35.490
Oi, Question Time,

02:35.491 --> 02:36.772
Shut the fuck up!

02:38.332 --> 02:39.532
If I go to jail,

02:39.533 --> 02:42.371
it won't be for renewable energy.

02:42.372 --> 02:43.771
The fucking shame!

02:43.772 --> 02:46.252
They'd stick you in with the nonces!

02:56.452 --> 02:57.931
I think it's lovely.

02:57.932 --> 03:00.611
The place smells of
piss and cabbage.

03:00.612 --> 03:02.011
Why be unpleasant?

03:02.012 --> 03:06.411
What did it gain you, that little
bit of fucking nastiness just now?

03:06.412 --> 03:08.091
All right, I take it back!

03:08.092 --> 03:10.771
The place smells of rose petals
and Chanel No. 5.

03:10.772 --> 03:12.330
Oi! What do you think you're doing?

03:12.331 --> 03:13.730
They're not going to miss them.

03:13.731 --> 03:15.370
Half of them
have forgot they smoke.

03:15.371 --> 03:16.732
Re-distribute the cigarettes.

03:20.612 --> 03:22.812
Same again all round, please.

03:23.852 --> 03:26.051
Kiss. My. Arse!

03:26.052 --> 03:27.651
What have I done?

03:27.652 --> 03:29.612
Apart from casual theft
and abuse of trust?

03:32.012 --> 03:34.892
I think what you're doing
is very kind, Patty.

03:36.452 --> 03:38.132
Most of these folks have no-one.

03:39.972 --> 03:42.571
Loved ones dead and gone,
moved away,

03:42.572 --> 03:44.731
or just couldn't be fecked with them
anymore.

03:44.732 --> 03:46.450
I'll bring your drinks over, Patty.

03:46.451 --> 03:47.290
Thank you.

03:47.291 --> 03:48.532
What's that smell?

03:50.732 --> 03:53.291
I am not clambering
across any more roofs.

03:53.292 --> 03:54.451
You never did.

03:54.452 --> 03:56.091
You held the ladder.

03:56.092 --> 03:57.972
I clambered across
the fucking rooftops.

03:57.973 --> 04:00.851
Whatever, I'm not doing it.

04:00.852 --> 04:03.411
I want a proper, legit business.

04:03.412 --> 04:05.972
If you want to stay the Artful
Dodger all your life, go ahead.

04:08.532 --> 04:10.891
What are you doing?

04:10.892 --> 04:13.211
Saving myself a job.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.572
I'd only have to pack it up
and take it to the dump.

04:15.573 --> 04:17.930
You can't give it away!

04:17.932 --> 04:20.891
Jackson, it's the end-of-the-day
shit that even we can't get shot of.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.172
Fucking dogs wouldn't eat it.

04:23.612 --> 04:25.411
Carry on. It's fine for you.

04:25.412 --> 04:27.731
This is a business.

04:27.732 --> 04:30.011
Allow them a loaf
and bag of stale lettuce,

04:30.012 --> 04:32.732
while they ponder
where they might sleep tonight!

04:34.412 --> 04:36.131
Again, feel free to continue.

04:36.132 --> 04:37.132
Basic economics.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.971
People won't pay for stuff
they can get for free.

04:39.972 --> 04:42.531
Economics, my arse!

04:42.532 --> 04:44.171
You're a snob!

04:44.172 --> 04:45.331
Bollocks!

04:45.332 --> 04:47.530
You won't steal solar panels
from the middle class,

04:47.531 --> 04:49.090
but you're happy to see them starve.

04:49.091 --> 04:50.772
I hate tramps as much
as the next man,

04:50.773 --> 04:53.651
but you can't stand by and watch
them starve, while you bin grub.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.531
Yes, you can.

04:55.532 --> 04:57.851
Word gets out you're giving it away,

04:57.852 --> 05:00.931
we won't have a business or money,
or fuck all!

05:00.932 --> 05:02.971
Go on then. Ask them for it back.

05:02.972 --> 05:05.451
As of tomorrow,

05:05.452 --> 05:06.972
we split what's left
down the middle.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.331
Fair enough.

05:08.332 --> 05:10.011
You'll damage us.

05:10.012 --> 05:12.331
No, I won't.
I'll feed a couple of muppets,

05:12.332 --> 05:15.051
and I'll get to feel
less of a cunt for a while.

05:15.052 --> 05:16.852
What could be better?

05:18.452 --> 05:21.411
Never put her hand in her pocket
all day,

05:21.412 --> 05:25.251
started a kitty,
and then pocketed the change.

05:25.252 --> 05:26.852
Smart as paint, that one.

05:30.252 --> 05:32.491
It's a gender thing.

05:32.492 --> 05:34.731
Men need sex,

05:34.732 --> 05:36.571
women choose sex.

05:36.572 --> 05:39.251
It's not a choice
with me. I can't go without.

05:39.252 --> 05:40.532
Can tell by the way you walk.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.051
Cheeky!

05:42.052 --> 05:44.611
I'm with Ruby.
We're fighting biology.

05:44.612 --> 05:48.251
Women are more evolved,
more developed.

05:48.252 --> 05:51.411
We choose our partners.

05:51.412 --> 05:53.652
Men would fuck a hole in the wall
if they had to.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.331
They're like animals with needs.

05:55.332 --> 05:57.291
Shut up! I'm single!

05:57.292 --> 06:00.651
I am living in hope of finding
the last remaining good one.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.931
Oh, that ship sailed long ago,
love.

06:02.932 --> 06:05.372
Last good man - Cary Grant.

06:09.372 --> 06:11.931
Open relationship, my arse!

06:11.932 --> 06:13.612
- Out!
- I'm just finishing...

06:13.613 --> 06:14.932
Out!

06:16.292 --> 06:17.372
You have needs.

06:19.492 --> 06:22.531
Food, shelter, and basic sanitation.

06:22.532 --> 06:24.932
Would you shag a hole in the wall?

06:26.852 --> 06:28.092
Do you want me to?

06:28.093 --> 06:31.052
We haven't had sex in three weeks.

06:32.212 --> 06:33.571
You're always too tired.

06:33.572 --> 06:35.651
You're asleep before me every night.

06:35.652 --> 06:38.011
Then I'm always tired.

06:38.012 --> 06:41.451
When I finish my shift,

06:41.452 --> 06:43.932
we're going to do some riding.

06:49.652 --> 06:51.291
Place your bets.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.812
Now's your chance to win back
some of your cash.

07:01.092 --> 07:02.411
Again?!

07:02.412 --> 07:03.492
In the living room.

07:06.652 --> 07:08.411
Ahem!

07:08.412 --> 07:11.132
Someone'll steal your fags one day.
We all get old.

07:13.252 --> 07:15.531
She hit me! Get off!

07:15.532 --> 07:18.051
Pack it in, the pair of you!
Lend a fucking hand!

07:18.052 --> 07:20.372
She's robbed my watch!

07:21.452 --> 07:24.491
Does someone want to tell me
what this is all about!?

07:24.492 --> 07:26.052
I won the watch fair and square!

07:27.492 --> 07:29.531
I took it off,
cause I'm retaining water,

07:29.532 --> 07:33.131
and my wrists are all swelled up.

07:33.132 --> 07:35.531
Next thing, it's on her wrist!

07:35.532 --> 07:37.892
The mad cow ran out of money
and wagered the watch!

07:37.893 --> 07:39.931
I did no such thing!

07:39.932 --> 07:43.371
I extend the hand of friendship
to you people,

07:43.372 --> 07:45.571
and this is how I'm repaid?

07:45.572 --> 07:47.052
I'm attacked in my own home!

07:48.372 --> 07:51.172
I think it's time you all left.

07:56.132 --> 07:57.651
Come on.

07:57.652 --> 07:59.692
That's it.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.611
Tell me that woman was mistaken.

08:05.612 --> 08:09.092
She barely knows
Christmas from Tuesday.

08:48.452 --> 08:49.971
Are they...?

08:49.972 --> 08:52.051
Like rabbits.

08:52.052 --> 08:55.411
Running commentary
for a good hour now.

08:55.412 --> 08:57.052
My sainted mother.

09:03.132 --> 09:07.171
Oh, that was fucking awesome!

09:07.172 --> 09:10.211
You could suck the chrome
off an exhaust pipe!

09:10.212 --> 09:12.011
Ow! What the fuck?!

09:12.012 --> 09:13.250
You're faking it!

09:13.251 --> 09:13.812
I'm not!

09:13.813 --> 09:15.451
I didn't have the chance

09:15.452 --> 09:16.811
to spit or swallow.

09:16.812 --> 09:18.971
There's fuck all there!

09:18.972 --> 09:20.132
It's dry as the Gobi!

09:24.332 --> 09:26.052
How long's this been going on?

09:28.412 --> 09:30.251
Don't you love me anymore?

09:30.252 --> 09:32.331
Now you're just offending me.

09:32.332 --> 09:32.972
What's going on?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.172
Nothing!

09:38.772 --> 09:42.012
I'll just finish myself off
then, shall I?!

09:45.252 --> 09:46.532
Taped Corrie for you.

09:46.533 --> 09:47.972
Omnibus.

10:01.983 --> 10:04.262
Poor buggers have hardly got two
brain cells as a group,

10:04.325 --> 10:05.725
and you're fleecing them!?

10:05.838 --> 10:09.996
It was a card game. Sometimes you
win, sometimes you lose. They lost.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.759
Should be ashamed of yourself.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.039
You were robbing their cigarettes.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.319
With no skill whatsoever, I may add.
Might as well have sounded a klaxon.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.040
A few tabs isn't purses
and jewellery.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.879
No, it isn't.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.039
Where do you two get the nerve
to try

10:25.040 --> 10:27.960
and occupy the moral high ground?

10:29.240 --> 10:33.479
You, a harlot, in the
old-fashioned Biblical sense.

10:33.480 --> 10:38.799
And you, a truanting, occasional
drug-running little arsehole.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.400
Hardly paragons of virtue.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.839
Come ahead, you fucking pricks.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
Look, you got us wrong!

11:14.841 --> 11:16.439
You're Shane Maguire...

11:16.440 --> 11:19.079
What the fuck's it to you?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.599
What you doing?

11:20.600 --> 11:24.039
These fuckers are after doing me in.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.840
We just want... food.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.879
Food?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.120
Been out of work since summer
and we heard you help people.

11:30.121 --> 11:32.240
Oh, for fuck's sake.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.200
You "help people" - like Spider-Man.

11:35.201 --> 11:40.240
And what were you gonna do, Chatsworth Ninja,
fucking meditate them into submission?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.319
It was karate.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.759
It was bollocks.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.799
Let's get some food
for these muppets.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.719
Oh, no, that's your look-out,
fuck all to do with me.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.159
He'll do you a good deal on
a solar panel as well, lads.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.960
Heat your water with
the Manchester sun.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.600
Oh, fuck off.

11:59.320 --> 12:07.400
She was on a losing streak and accused me - me - of
dishonesty, in an attempt to recover her losses.

12:07.401 --> 12:11.719
Why not give it back?

12:11.720 --> 12:12.400
All right, Jez?

12:12.401 --> 12:13.559
Excuse me?

12:13.560 --> 12:17.079
You should be gambling
for coppers,

12:17.080 --> 12:18.799
not watches and pearls and shit,

12:18.800 --> 12:21.959
it's not fair for the people
with... you know, mental.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.920
Dementia or not, a bet's a bet,
there's a principle.

12:23.921 --> 12:27.479
And you wonder how come
you've got no mates.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.240
I have many close... acquaintances.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.120
I'll give you 40 for this.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.799
What the fuck's going on?!

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
Excuse I.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.720
And a herb and avocado wrap, please.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.640
Out of my way, you fucking tramp.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.718
You were supposed to clear the yard,
not fill it up with

13:06.719 --> 13:09.439
- The Boys from the Blackstuff.
- He's proving a point.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.559
That shite attracts flies?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.400
That he can give
away left-over stock,

13:14.401 --> 13:16.759
without it affecting
the business, or his life.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.399
They kept coming all fucking day '

13:18.400 --> 13:21.199
I thought it'd make more sense
to throw it all together,

13:21.200 --> 13:22.318
make a big pot.

13:22.319 --> 13:23.920
So you're Mother Theresa now, then?

13:23.921 --> 13:26.199
I'm trying to get shot of
the smelly bastards...

13:26.200 --> 13:28.399
thought this might be
a bit quicker.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.240
You wanna earn your place
in heaven,

13:30.241 --> 13:35.719
take your spares down to Saint Macs,
Father McGinn runs a kitchen there.

13:35.720 --> 13:39.640
I'm not trying to...

13:40.880 --> 13:44.720
Shouldn't laugh quite so hard -
peed yourself a little bit there.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.960
All right, one at a fucking time!

13:53.920 --> 13:58.160
I want my yard back.
Fucking move, you scruffy twats!

13:59.360 --> 14:01.199
Have you got any bacon?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.440
What do you think?

14:06.480 --> 14:07.760
You're firing blanks?

14:07.761 --> 14:09.799
Don't fucking say nothing, please.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.479
You got a kid, you can't be.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.880
No, it's not exactly blanks,

14:12.881 --> 14:15.559
everything's as usual,
and the sex is fucking mint,

14:15.560 --> 14:19.439
it's just... every time I pull
the trigger, no bullets.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.279
Maybe you are faking it.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.158
I'd know, wouldn't I?

14:22.159 --> 14:23.080
Men can't fake it.

14:23.081 --> 14:24.919
Of course they can.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.959
This one time,
I was banging a right dog,

14:26.960 --> 14:31.799
yeah, so I'm fucking pounding away
and pounding away,

14:31.800 --> 14:34.520
but, no flourish at the end,
you know. So, I faked it all.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.599
"Argh, yeah, baby,
I'm gonna come..."

14:39.600 --> 14:40.800
Fuck off!

14:42.520 --> 14:43.919
Did she not know?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.839
Nah, man, she was just grateful.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.440
Yeah, grateful that you got off her.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.679
Shit. Nah, but honestly,
the sex is fucking amazing,

14:54.680 --> 14:58.440
and loads of it,
but it's just no spunk.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.200
Maybe I've used it all up.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.280
You can't get a tan off them,
you know?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.280
Get upstairs,
I'm gonna fuck you juicy.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.119
Thought you'd gone to work.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.280
Just heading. Bye, now.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.279
Stack the pallets when you're done,
Father, I'll pick them up later.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.519
I can't tell you how grateful
we are, Shane.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.839
Well, was only gonna toss it,
so...

16:06.840 --> 16:10.799
I shouldn't be worrying about where
they've come from, should I?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.118
No, it's all legit.
Pass it on with a clear conscience.

16:13.119 --> 16:14.240
I'll give your regards
to me mam, yeah?

16:14.241 --> 16:15.879
Come to the hall later,

16:15.880 --> 16:18.639
see the
difference your generosity can make?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.040
If this is to be a regular thing,

16:20.041 --> 16:22.879
you should at least see
where your donation goes.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.200
With all due respect, Father,

16:24.201 --> 16:26.799
I'm not naturally sympathetic
to tramps...

16:26.800 --> 16:28.359
The homeless.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.720
You're on your uppers, don't go asking for
hand-outs, get off your arse and sort it.

16:31.721 --> 16:33.279
So, why help?

16:33.280 --> 16:36.520
Like I say, it was either here
or the bin. Don't make me Gandhi.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.360
Price tag over sell-by, they've at
least got a couple of days in them.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.879
Brie and black grape?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.000
Shaun Ryder.

16:59.120 --> 16:59.760
What?

16:59.761 --> 17:01.080
Nothing.

17:03.000 --> 17:12.480
- C'mon, it's a job lot, you can't pick and choose,
all or nothing.
- I'll give you a tenner for the lot.

17:12.481 --> 17:16.760
Fuck off, there's 100 items here,
easy. 40.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.319
This is me being generous.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.320
Can I have this back, please?

17:45.680 --> 17:48.200
Get some weed. And get a
load of sweets for tonight.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.440
Too late.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.480
What? Oh, you're joking.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.920
How many times is that?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.600
Three, maybe four.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
Anything?

18:16.360 --> 18:17.919
Dry as Gandhi's flip-flop.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.719
Thought so. I've got friction burns.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.159
Do you want to quit?

18:23.160 --> 18:25.679
Fuck, no.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.200
The only way to get over a bad patch
is to hump your way out of it.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.719
Just let me baste the goose.
Come on.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.080
Fuck.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.759
Jesus, Tish.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.880
Shouldn't you be hanging around
street corners drinking cider?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.240
I'm not going to ask,
you're gonna have to tell me.

19:04.280 --> 19:08.839
You know, like you said I could have
Nana's wedding ring when you died?

19:08.840 --> 19:11.680
When I die, future tense.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.279
I kind of borrowed it.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.599
Explain "kind of."

19:18.600 --> 19:22.599
You're not allowed to wear
jewellery to school.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.080
I pawned it.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.960
And they've lost it.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.200
Where's the ring?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.639
She's still got plenty of time
to get it back.

19:44.640 --> 19:49.639
She must have altered the receipt,
you know what kids are like.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.400
Where is it?

19:50.401 --> 19:54.519
I may have weighed it
and sent it off for cash.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.319
Sent to who?

19:56.320 --> 20:00.279
I packed up a whole load
of unclaimed,

20:00.280 --> 20:02.959
second-rate items to one
of those companies,

20:02.960 --> 20:06.559
Brass-for-Gold-dot-www
or something.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.759
It may have got mixed up with that.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.359
You sold my mum's ring on
to some trashy scrap merchant?

20:12.360 --> 20:16.719
What I sent was little better
than costume jewellery.

20:16.720 --> 20:21.279
You're welcome to the money,
I don't want it, it's tainted.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.279
Now if you don't mind,
I'm having my fecking tea.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.439
Lapsang Souchong, mind,
none of your Darjeeling crap.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.240
You're mental.

20:29.241 --> 20:30.879
No, I'm livid.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.079
What kind of world
is it where a poor pensioner

20:34.080 --> 20:35.719
can't eat her cake in peace?

20:35.720 --> 20:37.480
There must be a cancellation clause,
a declaration?

20:37.481 --> 20:40.679
I signed all the forms,
it's above board.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.759
It wasn't yours to sell!
You stole it.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.279
How dare you!

20:44.280 --> 20:47.479
I want the ring back,
or I'm going to the police.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.800
- They'll laugh at you.
- Be with you in five minutes, mate.

20:49.801 --> 20:53.239
I'm just looking for my wife's
engagement ring.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.760
Ah, feck!

20:57.200 --> 21:01.319
Muesli, yoghurt, bio-thingy,
freshly squeezed orange,

21:01.320 --> 21:03.519
fresh coffee and for dessert,

21:03.520 --> 21:06.439
a little bit of bugle.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.080
Really? All day?

21:10.320 --> 21:12.519
I've been stuck here for hours,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.840
leave, before she gets her
powdered rhino horn out.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.840
You ready for the next round,
lover?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.160
Baby?

21:33.240 --> 21:34.640
I've got no spunk.

21:36.280 --> 21:40.119
For weeks, I keep coming and coming,
and everything's great,

21:40.120 --> 21:43.720
but nothing comes out.
I'm totally dry.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.480
I'm spunkless.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.079
Are you sure this won't
affect your business?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.519
I'm determined it won't.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.279
My partner's laughing
up his cuff at me.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.279
Might have a point,
you can't afford to show weakness

22:06.280 --> 22:07.639
in business these days.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.720
We do all right.

22:08.721 --> 22:13.319
Sorry, guys, you're too late -
we're eaten out of house and home.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.160
Sally Army in Langley run a kitchen
till nine, though.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.239
Quite a bit still left there,
would've done them.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.199
You need to establish boundaries,
or it gets unmanageable,

22:24.200 --> 22:27.319
feed those guys now, and two more
will be along in half an hour,

22:27.320 --> 22:30.919
then three more an hour after that.
You end up a 24/7 cafe.

22:30.920 --> 22:34.199
And besides, it helps people
in their situation

22:34.200 --> 22:38.839
to have some structure, some rules,
helps give shape to their day.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.919
Well, I don't know how you do it,
I wouldn't have the patience.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.519
Same time tomorrow, padre.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.760
Yep.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.640
How are we today?
Mind if I join you?

23:34.920 --> 23:38.839
Keep it to yourselves,
but you'll never believe

23:38.840 --> 23:40.719
who I saw doing the walk of shame.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.320
Give it a rest, Patty,
not interested.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.039
You bitch.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.880
Yeah, go on, piss off.

24:21.284 --> 24:23.244
There's tea in the pot.

24:29.444 --> 24:34.724
I've been made redundant,
did you hear?

24:42.044 --> 24:45.363
It would seem I'm to be made
a scapegoat,

24:45.364 --> 24:50.283
for all sorts of the pent-up
bitterness from every quarter.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.563
Little more than victimisation,

24:52.976 --> 24:57.536
and me, a senior citizen
with special needs.

25:00.256 --> 25:03.095
I'm not sure my health is up to it.

25:03.096 --> 25:05.295
26 people, you stole from,

25:05.296 --> 25:10.695
that's the ones we know about,
some in a far worse state than you.

25:10.696 --> 25:13.056
And not a word of fucking remorse.

25:18.696 --> 25:21.375
I'm sorry, all right?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.396
If that's what it takes.

25:25.676 --> 25:29.315
Maybe I'm being punished by...

25:29.316 --> 25:32.715
you know who. I've fucked too much,
enjoyed it more than I should.

25:32.716 --> 25:36.796
Sex is a gift from God, baby,
you're supposed to enjoy it.

25:37.916 --> 25:41.675
All those little Rain Man thoughts
running about up there.

25:41.676 --> 25:43.995
Don't think, just do.

25:43.996 --> 25:46.875
Actually, that might be
the worst thing you can do.

25:46.876 --> 25:49.475
If you don't mind me butting in.

25:49.476 --> 25:51.595
It's kind of personal, Father.

25:51.596 --> 25:54.515
Don't call him Father.
He's not even practising.

25:54.516 --> 25:57.475
Just a random bloke who wants
to talk about my spunk.

25:57.476 --> 25:59.555
I know something about this.

25:59.556 --> 26:00.875
What, God or spunk?

26:00.876 --> 26:02.755
We could use the help.

26:02.756 --> 26:05.035
Is something bothering you,
making you anxious?

26:05.036 --> 26:06.835
I don't think so.

26:06.836 --> 26:08.316
Happy with your life, marriage?

26:08.317 --> 26:11.835
I love Mimi, right,
don't ever say that!

26:11.836 --> 26:12.876
The Scouser's right.

26:12.877 --> 26:15.955
You don't have to over-think these
things, it's a bodily function.

26:15.956 --> 26:19.835
Right, this is a private
conversation!

26:19.836 --> 26:21.795
It's not an uncommon problem,

26:21.796 --> 26:24.876
the pair of you, come round to
mine later, soon have it sorted.

26:40.196 --> 26:41.595
You're late.

26:41.596 --> 26:44.475
Sorry, my partner was busy
walking on water.

26:44.476 --> 26:45.736
Should've come earlier,
it's all gone.

26:45.833 --> 26:46.911
What has?

26:46.912 --> 26:50.391
Everything - produce, bakery,
ready meals, about an hour ago.

26:50.392 --> 26:51.991
I'm not following.

26:51.992 --> 26:54.432
Manager brought the bloke down,
got us to load the van,

26:54.433 --> 26:57.191
supposed to have it ready
for collection, same time, every day.

26:57.192 --> 26:58.231
What bloke?

26:58.232 --> 26:59.911
The Priest, from Saint Mac's.

26:59.912 --> 27:03.031
He gets all the sell-by from now on,
totally gratis.

27:03.032 --> 27:05.672
I'm gutted,
that were a nice little earner.

27:19.432 --> 27:22.551
No way are these ten-denier, Chesney,
no light gets through,

27:22.552 --> 27:24.032
fucking 80 if they're a day.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.631
It says ten on the packet.

27:25.632 --> 27:27.951
Yeah, and made in Uzbekistan.

27:27.952 --> 27:30.071
Oh, for fuck's sake.

27:30.072 --> 27:32.871
I'll be gone before you know it.
I've come to collect my things.

27:32.872 --> 27:34.512
Yeah, I've boxed 'em up.

27:36.552 --> 27:37.951
Are you all right?

27:37.952 --> 27:39.511
I'm fine.

27:39.512 --> 27:42.272
Did someone throw that at you?

27:47.512 --> 27:51.751
Don't matter what she did, throwing
things at an old lady is not right.

27:51.976 --> 27:54.416
No, it's not.

28:10.976 --> 28:12.655
I fucking told you!

28:12.656 --> 28:16.495
How was I supposed to know we'd get
done over by a priest?

28:16.496 --> 28:19.615
You've cost me my living,
you've lost our business

28:19.616 --> 28:22.575
because you wanted to get one over
on me, and feel good about yourself.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.456
It's fuck all to do
with that and you know it.

28:24.457 --> 28:27.975
Basic common sense,
you give something for nothing

28:27.976 --> 28:31.415
and people will grab it off you,
because you put no value on it.

28:31.416 --> 28:33.055
That's not entirely true is it?

28:33.056 --> 28:34.615
You gave it away!

28:34.616 --> 28:38.375
You valued the business at nothing,
so now we have nothing!

28:38.376 --> 28:42.095
Look at this place,
you're not a businessman,

28:42.096 --> 28:44.655
you're a
petty thief/rag and bone man,

28:44.656 --> 28:46.655
you're fucking klepto Steptoe.

28:46.656 --> 28:50.936
There's got to be a mistake,
right, he's a priest.

28:58.176 --> 29:02.535
How many times, you cannot get
a tan from a solar panel!

29:02.536 --> 29:03.696
Jesus!

29:05.496 --> 29:07.136
Thinks he knows everything.

29:27.576 --> 29:29.376
'Night.

29:42.856 --> 29:44.416
Why'd you do it?

29:46.496 --> 29:49.735
I never thought they'd return
for their goods.

29:49.736 --> 29:52.495
Most don't. Glad to get what little
we can give them.

29:52.496 --> 29:56.736
I never asked you to explain
the opportunity. I asked why.

29:59.656 --> 30:02.815
You and Marty will be
making a life for yourselves,

30:02.816 --> 30:07.815
some place,
Aidan has his future ahead of him,

30:07.816 --> 30:10.655
which leaves me with
Frank Gallagher,

30:10.656 --> 30:13.295
who's going to look after me then?

30:13.296 --> 30:15.615
Bollocks,
don't kid a fucking kidder,

30:15.616 --> 30:18.095
this isn't about a rainy-day fund.

30:18.096 --> 30:20.935
Don't keep lying, Patty...

30:20.936 --> 30:23.256
much like yourself, it's getting old.

30:32.216 --> 30:35.975
Anejaculation.
It's a condition, dry cumming.

30:35.976 --> 30:37.375
Am I dying?

30:37.376 --> 30:39.095
Don't be fucking soft!

30:39.096 --> 30:41.935
Dominic was right, it's anxiety,

30:41.936 --> 30:44.496
your jizz is worried about
coming out.

30:47.736 --> 30:49.295
What the fuck's that?

30:49.296 --> 30:50.695
An electro-ejaculator,

30:50.696 --> 30:55.375
a gift from a grateful
psychiatric nurse, back in the day.

30:55.376 --> 30:58.055
I wiped it down wi' Vim.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.015
How's it work?

31:00.016 --> 31:03.575
It stimulates the prostate gland -
milks the man, essentially.

31:03.576 --> 31:05.936
Is the prostate
the one at the back of the throat?

31:05.937 --> 31:07.136
The other one.

31:15.816 --> 31:17.176
All right, baby? Is it in?

31:18.616 --> 31:20.456
Likes to keep himself
nice and clean.

31:20.457 --> 31:21.775
He's a stickler.

31:21.776 --> 31:22.976
Kind of ironic, really,

31:22.977 --> 31:26.136
considering you're such a fan
of back-door this, back-door that.

31:28.696 --> 31:32.536
Fuck me, love is...?

31:33.896 --> 31:36.216
Wonder how long it'll take.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.016
That should do it.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.095
I've put some credit on that.
So if you need me, ring.

31:47.096 --> 31:49.735
But don't take the piss.

31:49.736 --> 31:51.695
Get to fucking school!

31:51.696 --> 31:53.056
I'm going.

31:54.096 --> 31:56.255
Was on the step.
Has your name on it.

31:56.256 --> 31:59.495
They're going to make you repeat,
you know.

31:59.496 --> 32:01.895
You'll be in school
till you're fucking 24.

32:01.896 --> 32:02.976
Can they do that?

32:02.977 --> 32:04.096
Oh, my...!

32:05.776 --> 32:08.015
Jesus Christ!

32:08.016 --> 32:10.255
It's shit! It's human shit!

32:10.256 --> 32:11.296
How d'you know?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.656
Be my guest.

32:19.416 --> 32:23.015
How many pallets is that?
What a bastard.

32:23.016 --> 32:24.695
I am fucking having him.

32:24.696 --> 32:28.616
No violence - makes him a victim,
gets him sympathy.

32:29.696 --> 32:33.056
Sympathy keeping you warm, is it?

32:41.976 --> 32:43.375
You stitched us up.

32:43.376 --> 32:45.455
You said it wouldn't
affect your business.

32:45.456 --> 32:48.215
There is no business any more,
you've taken it.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.815
Shut us down.

32:49.816 --> 32:51.576
All's fair in love,
war and business.

32:51.577 --> 32:53.735
It's a brilliant idea,

32:53.736 --> 32:56.495
making use of what greedy
corporate giants throw away.

32:56.496 --> 32:58.935
You couldn't buy publicity
like this...

32:58.936 --> 33:00.895
how kind they are,

33:00.896 --> 33:03.695
how humane.
Everyone's a winner!

33:03.696 --> 33:04.935
Except us.

33:04.936 --> 33:07.175
Collateral damage.

33:07.176 --> 33:10.855
Think of it as a sacrifice
for the greater good.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.615
That business was our livelihood.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.535
Not much of a business,
living off scraps.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.295
I'm sorry, mate, I was wrong.

33:18.296 --> 33:23.455
I owe you an apology
but I will make it up to you.

33:23.456 --> 33:26.255
I hope that's not a threat.

33:26.256 --> 33:28.775
Threats.

33:28.776 --> 33:30.976
Now that is my business.

33:35.336 --> 33:36.776
What are you going to do?

33:36.777 --> 33:38.096
Haven't a clue, mate.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.339
McGinn's one of the good guys,
old school, mind,

33:43.373 --> 33:45.073
bit Old Testament,
not big on tolerance.

33:45.110 --> 33:48.108
Not big on tolerance.

33:48.185 --> 33:49.664
What do you mean?

33:49.665 --> 33:52.024
Well, he's been at St Mac's
for 27 years.

33:52.025 --> 33:54.964
Y'know, one parish, all the time.

33:54.994 --> 33:56.193
Thank you.

33:56.194 --> 33:59.713
Used to be a smart area.
He hates that it's not now.

33:59.714 --> 34:03.073
You can see the resentment
sweating through his pores.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.153
So, doesn't tolerate who?

34:05.154 --> 34:08.554
Anybody who doesn't meet
his exacting standards.

34:16.514 --> 34:20.393
Put your pen down!
Don't be a loser all your life.

34:26.194 --> 34:28.273
Sent it back, no questions asked.

34:28.274 --> 34:30.553
Can I have it back now?
I've learnt my lesson.

34:30.554 --> 34:33.473
When I'm dead, that's
when you can have it back.

34:33.474 --> 34:34.474
Fuck!

34:37.634 --> 34:38.914
Call an ambulance!

34:38.915 --> 34:40.234
Quick!

34:45.194 --> 34:47.193
Have you checked her pulse?

34:47.194 --> 34:50.473
So, are we supposed to use
this every time we...?

34:50.474 --> 34:52.793
No, baby.

34:52.793 --> 34:54.714
Emergencies only.

34:56.034 --> 34:57.634
Well, am I fixed?

35:03.234 --> 35:04.914
I don't think you are.

35:11.474 --> 35:15.793
There's nothing wrong with you
physically. It's in your head.

35:15.794 --> 35:18.914
Something's bothering you so much,
that you don't want to...

35:20.114 --> 35:21.192
do that with me.

35:21.193 --> 35:22.474
That's not true!

35:23.634 --> 35:26.674
Subconsciously, it's in your head.

35:29.554 --> 35:31.034
I know you think you love me.

35:31.035 --> 35:32.274
I do!

35:35.034 --> 35:37.713
Maybe what you really want,
deep down,

35:37.714 --> 35:40.114
is to be with girls your own age.

35:44.194 --> 35:48.393
Like that bit of stuff
you were hanging all over at
the pool table the other night.

35:48.394 --> 35:50.154
She was just a mate.

35:52.754 --> 35:56.193
There's something's
blocking your pipes.

35:56.194 --> 35:58.513
And I don't want to get in your way.

35:58.514 --> 35:59.993
You're not in the way.

35:59.994 --> 36:01.353
They're in the way.

36:01.354 --> 36:03.953
All the girls you make me see.

36:03.954 --> 36:08.754
I don't want to sleep with anyone
else. I just want to be with you.

36:10.914 --> 36:12.713
Don't cry, please.

36:12.714 --> 36:15.754
I married you and I only
want to be with you.

36:31.594 --> 36:33.913
What's wrong?

36:33.914 --> 36:35.794
I've just come in my pants.

36:42.674 --> 36:44.713
What d'you need him for?

36:44.714 --> 36:48.034
He's not a manager,
he's an assistant.

37:21.994 --> 37:27.513
I've never really seen him
cry before, not properly,

37:27.514 --> 37:29.233
sobbing, tears.

37:29.234 --> 37:32.113
That's gotta be a good thing.

37:32.114 --> 37:35.993
He's able to express himself,
let his feelings out.

37:35.994 --> 37:39.074
It's the other thing
that worries me.

37:40.914 --> 37:44.633
Seems to be unblocked everywhere.

37:44.634 --> 37:47.673
Y'know, he's clearly
been holding it all in.

37:47.674 --> 37:49.634
Love you, baby.

37:51.194 --> 37:52.874
Thank you, babe.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.913
We don't want any trouble.

38:12.914 --> 38:15.353
No trouble from me, Padre.

38:15.354 --> 38:17.753
I just want you to know,
I'm onto you.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.673
Good for you.

38:19.674 --> 38:22.193
Man in your position
has a lot to lose.

38:22.194 --> 38:23.393
It's a pity.

38:23.394 --> 38:25.954
I won't be intimidated.

38:30.354 --> 38:31.794
Wait!

38:36.434 --> 38:39.393
I will go to the police.

38:39.394 --> 38:41.753
There is nothing you
can legitimately...

38:41.754 --> 38:43.633
You're a bigot. Huh?

38:43.634 --> 38:46.833
No blacks, no Asians,

38:46.834 --> 38:48.074
no gays.

38:49.514 --> 38:50.593
It's not true!

38:50.594 --> 38:53.273
We care for all colours,
creeds and sexualities here.

38:53.274 --> 38:54.554
Bollocks!

38:56.994 --> 38:59.073
I know the sting of bigotry.

38:59.074 --> 39:02.313
I have experienced the
sharp end of prejudice,

39:02.314 --> 39:06.033
so don't think you can
play that card with me.

39:06.034 --> 39:07.954
Used to be black, did you?

39:08.994 --> 39:11.433
I'm a homosexual, as it happens.

39:11.434 --> 39:14.153
I don't practise, of course.
That would be sinful.

39:14.154 --> 39:16.034
Now, that is fucked up for a start.

39:16.035 --> 39:17.154
Do you mind?

39:18.394 --> 39:21.513
I can't open the door to
everybody who comes knocking.

39:21.514 --> 39:23.913
We'd be swamped with the wrong type.

39:23.914 --> 39:25.873
The "wrong type"?

39:25.874 --> 39:29.913
I don't care about gay or
straight, creed or colour,

39:29.914 --> 39:32.153
I'm talking about you people.

39:32.154 --> 39:34.033
You filthy, fucking people,

39:34.034 --> 39:38.153
with your crime and your drugs
and your constant breeding,

39:38.154 --> 39:39.473
always breeding!

39:39.474 --> 39:42.273
You should all be sterilised.

39:42.274 --> 39:43.953
Like I said,

39:43.954 --> 39:45.153
a bigot.

39:45.154 --> 39:49.233
This was a good area -
schools, houses, nice roads,

39:49.234 --> 39:53.313
but then the 'Underbelly'
had to be given a chance.

39:53.314 --> 39:57.194
- Good people are supposed to be
protected from your kind.
- The "wrong type", yeah?

39:57.195 --> 39:59.193
Yes, the wrong fucking type.

39:59.194 --> 40:03.913
Well, maybe all the "wrong type"
could live in the same place,

40:03.914 --> 40:07.593
maybe get 'em a little uniform...

40:07.594 --> 40:08.953
stripes,

40:08.954 --> 40:10.634
little yellow star.

40:11.874 --> 40:13.473
That is beneath you.

40:13.474 --> 40:16.833
But not beneath you, apparently.

40:16.834 --> 40:21.033
Now I'm guessing this could be
the wrong kind of publicity.

40:21.034 --> 40:22.833
Meet Mr Wardak.

40:22.834 --> 40:26.754
I believe his employer
supplied today's foodstuffs.

40:29.074 --> 40:30.473
Blackmail?

40:30.474 --> 40:32.593
That's, uh,

40:32.594 --> 40:34.993
rather crass.

40:34.994 --> 40:36.314
But effective.

40:38.754 --> 40:43.834
All is fair in love,
war and business, Padre.

40:50.194 --> 40:52.153
You really don't want to?

40:52.154 --> 40:55.473
No. I hate sleeping
with other women

40:55.474 --> 40:57.433
I only do it cos you make me.

40:57.434 --> 41:01.194
You're my wife and
I want to fuck you.

41:02.954 --> 41:06.473
Then let's end this
open relationship thing.

41:06.474 --> 41:07.874
Let's just be...

41:08.914 --> 41:10.714
you for me, and me for you.

41:12.714 --> 41:14.033
Are you sure?

41:14.034 --> 41:16.633
Of course I am.

41:16.634 --> 41:18.714
Oh, thanks, babe.

41:42.074 --> 41:44.153
Everyone deserves a second chance,

41:44.154 --> 41:47.153
so you can have your job back.

41:47.154 --> 41:50.633
Clerical duties only once
you're back on your feet,

41:50.634 --> 41:52.713
so to speak.

41:52.714 --> 41:55.914
Well, I'm very grateful.

41:57.754 --> 41:59.714
It may be a while.

42:02.034 --> 42:03.874
We'll give you some peace.

42:33.194 --> 42:36.393
I have no evidence whatsoever
for what I'm about to say,

42:36.394 --> 42:38.474
so you're off the hook, either way.

42:41.314 --> 42:43.193
Bag of flour,

42:43.194 --> 42:45.073
turd in an envelope,

42:45.074 --> 42:48.073
tragic fall from your chair,

42:48.074 --> 42:50.553
from which you made
a miraculous recovery.

42:50.554 --> 42:52.273
What are you...?

42:52.274 --> 42:53.834
No protests, no denials.

42:59.954 --> 43:03.073
If I licked my finger and
wiped it across your eye,

43:03.074 --> 43:04.914
how would your bruises be then?

43:16.394 --> 43:20.153
You... are a devious,

43:20.154 --> 43:23.034
conniving old fraud.

43:24.514 --> 43:28.353
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

43:28.354 --> 43:29.954
Course you don't.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.794
From one tough bird to another...

43:38.554 --> 43:42.714
if it stops here,
your secret's safe.

43:44.634 --> 43:46.074
Understood?

44:04.554 --> 44:07.513
'Competition is a good thing.

44:07.514 --> 44:09.593
'It provides
motivation and incentive.

44:09.594 --> 44:14.073
'Sir Chris Hoy and his giant thighs
didn't get onto the Olympic podium

44:14.074 --> 44:17.033
'because it's the
taking part that counts.

44:17.034 --> 44:20.113
'But everyone has to start
with the same chance.

'That's how a society moves forward.
