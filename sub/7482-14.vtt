WEBVTT

00:18.633 --> 00:21.796
Take up the whole bench. Ugh.

00:28.076 --> 00:29.635
Hey, stop!

00:29.811 --> 00:30.835
Stop!

00:31.012 --> 00:32.673
Hey! LAP.D.!

00:59.207 --> 01:00.504
What the hell?

01:34.242 --> 01:37.644
- Well...
- It's last minute.

01:37.812 --> 01:40.907
No, it's not. It's tonight.
That's hours from now.

01:41.082 --> 01:42.413
I got stuff to do.

01:42.584 --> 01:43.710
Like what?

01:43.885 --> 01:46.445
Just, you know, stuff.

01:46.854 --> 01:49.255
Please. You're gonna leave here,

01:49.424 --> 01:51.518
you're gonna go get some takeout,
probably Indian,

01:51.693 --> 01:53.684
you're gonna go home,
you're gonna open a beer,

01:53.861 --> 01:56.796
turn on the History Channel,
and play chess against the computer.

01:56.965 --> 01:58.433
Oh, you are so off base.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.897
Oh, yeah?

02:00.568 --> 02:01.933
I'm having Greek food.

02:02.103 --> 02:03.764
No, you're coming out to dinner
with us.

02:03.938 --> 02:06.737
- Why can't I just come to your house?
- No, we're going out.

02:06.908 --> 02:09.467
It's important to Michelle and me,
all right?

02:09.644 --> 02:12.306
We have something
we wanna talk to you about.

02:13.781 --> 02:15.180
What?

02:15.450 --> 02:17.248
I'll tell you tonight.

02:21.856 --> 02:25.952
You can stare at me all you want.
I'm not telling you unless you show up.

02:26.761 --> 02:29.093
You're not gonna ask me
to be your kids' guardian, are you?

02:29.264 --> 02:31.665
I told you, that's not a good idea.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.765
L.A.P.D. just called
with a double homicide.

02:37.939 --> 02:40.874
- You have to see this.
- Why? Who are the victims?

02:41.042 --> 02:42.942
Richard Davis and James Miller.

02:43.111 --> 02:47.014
Both former military
and both formerly employed by...

02:47.181 --> 02:48.615
- Any guesses?
- Cirque du Soleil.

02:48.783 --> 02:50.945
No, Applebee's. You been there?

02:51.119 --> 02:52.985
Triple Treat Sampler?
Place is delicious.

02:53.154 --> 02:54.834
Entertainment industry
or service industry?

02:54.989 --> 02:56.957
What? At least I'm trying.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.854
How about our friends at D-7?

02:59.027 --> 03:02.964
The private contracting firm
linked to the plane crash in Burbank

03:03.131 --> 03:05.395
that killed former
Vice Admiral William Gardner

03:05.566 --> 03:07.398
and reporter, Jason Carter.

03:07.568 --> 03:09.730
That would have been
my next guess.

03:09.904 --> 03:12.202
Carter was ghostwriting
the admiral's memoir,

03:12.373 --> 03:14.603
which may have included references
to war crimes

03:14.776 --> 03:17.108
committed by D-7 contractors
in Afghanistan.

03:17.278 --> 03:18.803
- Is this related?
- Don't know.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.813
There were no witnesses. And I've
been checking traffic-cam footage,

03:21.983 --> 03:23.303
found nothing of interest so far.

03:23.451 --> 03:24.782
What's D-7 saying?

03:25.320 --> 03:27.311
Not much.
They shut down six weeks ago,

03:27.488 --> 03:29.183
probably due
to our ongoing investigation.

03:29.357 --> 03:31.052
Yeah, but that investigation
is stalled.

03:31.225 --> 03:33.250
- Until now.
- Shotgun!

03:34.696 --> 03:35.976
I am not riding in the backseat.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.859
- I'll put him in the trunk.
- Ha, ha.

03:39.334 --> 03:40.893
Granger.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.505
- Hey.
- "Assistant director” will suffice.

03:45.673 --> 03:47.163
Sorry. When did you get here?

03:47.775 --> 03:49.004
About 20 minutes ago.

03:49.177 --> 03:50.872
No. When did you get back
from Afghanistan?

03:51.045 --> 03:52.103
About 20 minutes ago.

03:55.249 --> 03:58.708
Wait. So does that mean
that the mission is over?

03:58.886 --> 04:00.513
No.

04:00.855 --> 04:03.483
And she's not here,
if you're asking about your partner.

04:04.759 --> 04:06.887
What, so you just...?
You just left her there?

04:07.061 --> 04:09.530
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.571
Okay, uh, I have vacation time
coming to me,

04:16.738 --> 04:18.298
and the guys have this placed
dialed in,

04:18.439 --> 04:20.168
so I was wondering,
if you wanted me to,

04:20.341 --> 04:22.139
I could go over there,
I could help out.

04:22.643 --> 04:23.940
Deeks, nothing personal,

04:24.112 --> 04:28.709
but you in Afghanistan sounds like
a National Lampoon Vacation movie.

04:31.819 --> 04:33.218
Right.

04:38.726 --> 04:40.387
But listen,

04:41.229 --> 04:42.856
she's doing good over there.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.030
Okay?

04:46.033 --> 04:47.432
Yeah.

04:50.838 --> 04:52.533
Thanks, Granger.

06:37.278 --> 06:38.473
Looking for something?

06:38.646 --> 06:40.512
Jeez. Yeah.

06:40.681 --> 06:43.207
You know how to turn up
the thermostat? It's freezing in here.

06:43.384 --> 06:44.874
Oh, thermostat's fine.

06:45.052 --> 06:47.817
One of the camp generators stopped.
Marines are working on it.

06:49.056 --> 06:51.457
- Where have you been?
- Just checking out the generator.

06:52.193 --> 06:54.890
- With your weapon?
- Don't leave home without it.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.492
All right, I'll see you in the morning.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.967
If you do get cold,
I got a heating blanket.

07:03.137 --> 07:04.536
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

07:04.705 --> 07:06.298
- Good night.
- Good night.

07:31.766 --> 07:33.029
Okay.

07:39.907 --> 07:42.171
Come on.

08:03.798 --> 08:05.766
Definitely wasn't a professional hit.

08:05.933 --> 08:08.630
- They left brass everywhere.
- Hmm.

08:12.273 --> 08:13.934
It was a bloody
back and forth struggle.

08:15.076 --> 08:16.805
Car was found parked down the street,

08:16.978 --> 08:18.707
so they must have walked over here.

08:19.447 --> 08:21.006
Another vehicle was here.

08:21.182 --> 08:22.911
Got its windshield smashed.

08:23.618 --> 08:26.747
Maybe they came to meet somebody,
things go sideways?

08:34.462 --> 08:36.897
Both bodies were found over here.

08:38.566 --> 08:40.330
So one guy gets hit,

08:40.501 --> 08:41.991
his buddy comes to help,

08:42.169 --> 08:44.159
he gets popped too.

08:51.579 --> 08:52.944
What do you think?

08:53.114 --> 08:55.947
I think Cinderella
was in the wrong part of town.

09:15.535 --> 09:18.505
- No way, forget it.
- What the...?

09:19.239 --> 09:21.765
Heh. Thanks a lot, fellas.

09:25.078 --> 09:27.740
Hey, Boys Town is that way.

09:27.914 --> 09:30.440
- Take it easy. You got a minute?
- Whoa.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.149
Hope you can do better than that.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.111
Just wanna talk.

09:36.890 --> 09:38.688
The older ones always do.

09:40.727 --> 09:41.956
Were you working last night?

09:42.128 --> 09:43.857
Day shift only. I got a kid in school.

09:44.030 --> 09:46.226
Double homicide
about 20 yards from here.

09:46.399 --> 09:48.060
Another reason I prefer
the lunch crowd.

09:48.535 --> 09:50.003
Can I help you, gentlemen?

09:51.938 --> 09:53.064
Just talking.

09:53.239 --> 09:55.799
I'm afraid my friend here
doesn't have time to talk.

09:55.975 --> 09:57.636
Oh. You're her friend?

09:58.411 --> 10:00.243
- And her agent.
- Ah.

10:00.747 --> 10:03.182
- He's an agent.
- That's funny, so are we.

10:03.349 --> 10:06.182
- See? Special agent.
- Wow.

10:06.352 --> 10:08.753
I give 10 percent discount
to all law enforcement.

10:09.255 --> 10:12.190
- Heh.
- Fifteen if you share the same girl.

10:14.861 --> 10:17.853
- How old are you?
- She doesn't speak English.

10:18.031 --> 10:20.295
- She's just visiting.
- You do realize prostitution

10:20.467 --> 10:22.265
and solicitation's illegal
in this country?

10:22.435 --> 10:24.130
Of course.

10:24.304 --> 10:28.207
I also do know that she doesn't have
to talk to you if she doesn't want to.

10:28.374 --> 10:29.842
I majored in law.

10:30.009 --> 10:31.602
Minored in stupid.

10:32.912 --> 10:34.038
Break's over. Let's go.

10:35.548 --> 10:37.380
Yeah. Break's over.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.850
Piece of garbage.

10:44.023 --> 10:46.185
I'd say you girls need a new agent.

10:50.463 --> 10:52.158
Elise.

10:55.468 --> 10:59.029
I think I found your Cinderella.
Elise Elena Jaeger, 30 years old.

10:59.205 --> 11:01.367
She was arrested twice
for prostitution.

11:01.541 --> 11:05.239
Got off once claiming entrapment
and once for insufficient evidence.

11:05.411 --> 11:07.675
Last known residence
is in Mar Vista.

11:07.847 --> 11:09.838
And last legitimate job

11:10.016 --> 11:12.417
seems to be a clothing store
on Hollywood Boulevard.

11:12.585 --> 11:15.384
All right, have Deeks pick her up
and meet us at the boatshed.

11:15.555 --> 11:16.989
We need to make a quick side trip.

11:17.157 --> 11:18.283
Where to?

11:18.458 --> 11:20.517
Protective Services.

11:38.278 --> 11:40.474
Did you, uh...?
Did you need something?

11:40.647 --> 11:42.137
Maybe.

11:42.549 --> 11:44.677
I want to, but I don't think I should.

11:45.118 --> 11:46.142
Should what?

11:46.820 --> 11:48.413
Involve you.

11:50.156 --> 11:51.521
Are you in trouble?

11:51.691 --> 11:53.090
No.

11:53.259 --> 11:55.057
Then what is it?

11:57.063 --> 11:58.861
Okay. All right.

11:59.032 --> 12:00.898
Look at me. Take a deep breath.

12:02.268 --> 12:03.736
Close your eyes.

12:03.903 --> 12:07.396
Let it out slowly.
Feel your muscles relaxing.

12:07.574 --> 12:10.168
Just think about butterflies
fluttering around you.

12:10.343 --> 12:12.334
Heh. What?

12:12.512 --> 12:15.277
Butterflies.
They're fluttery and they're calming.

12:15.448 --> 12:18.543
Okay, that's nice, but...

12:19.652 --> 12:23.020
- I think Kensi's in serious trouble.
- What's going on?

12:23.189 --> 12:25.988
She asked me to look
into CIA Officer Sabatino.

12:26.159 --> 12:29.322
His bank records, why he was pulled
off the Sidorov case.

12:29.495 --> 12:32.556
- That's not good.
- No. It gets worse.

12:32.732 --> 12:34.461
The guy he went over
to Afghanistan with

12:34.634 --> 12:35.863
got his head cut off.

12:36.035 --> 12:37.628
That's really not good.

12:39.772 --> 12:42.639
I think Kensi suspects Sabatino.

12:54.187 --> 12:56.986
- Nice look.
- You like it?

12:57.156 --> 12:58.851
Taliban chic.

12:59.025 --> 13:01.221
Well, most guys couldn't pull it off.

13:01.928 --> 13:03.362
I'm not sure you do either, but...

13:04.564 --> 13:06.896
- Where are you guys heading?
- Hunting bad guys.

13:07.066 --> 13:09.535
- Want some company?
- I don't think so.

13:09.702 --> 13:10.931
- I'm a good tracker.
- Yeah?

13:11.104 --> 13:12.833
- Yeah.
- I appreciate the offer,

13:13.006 --> 13:14.337
but like I said, I work alone.

13:15.775 --> 13:16.833
What about this guy?

13:17.010 --> 13:19.240
This guy? He's just dropping me off.

13:19.412 --> 13:20.504
- Right, Hung?
- Yes, sir.

13:21.281 --> 13:23.841
- All right. Suit yourself.
- Maybe next time.

13:25.051 --> 13:27.213
- Make sure he doesn't get lost.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:27.387 --> 13:28.980
Let's roll.

13:39.065 --> 13:41.193
Seriously,
they haven't fixed that generator yet?

13:41.367 --> 13:42.425
Not completely.

13:42.602 --> 13:44.366
It's either heat
or power for the equipment.

13:45.838 --> 13:48.364
Maybe I should light a bonfire
in the sink.

13:48.541 --> 13:49.872
I would not recommend that.

13:50.576 --> 13:51.873
Seriously?

13:52.045 --> 13:54.980
- You were kidding.
- Yeah. It's called humor.

13:55.148 --> 13:57.640
- You should try it sometime.
- Too cold to be funny.

13:57.817 --> 13:59.785
See? Now, that was funny.
How did that feel?

13:59.953 --> 14:02.854
- I can't feel anything.
- Okay.

14:03.022 --> 14:05.062
You know, I'm gonna ask Harris
to pull some strings.

14:05.224 --> 14:08.592
Oh, too late. She's gone. Granger
called her back to Washington.

14:08.761 --> 14:10.229
Why?

14:10.396 --> 14:12.888
- Above my pay grade.
- Who's in charge of the team now?

14:13.066 --> 14:15.558
Looks like it's Sabatino
until they send a replacement.

14:16.102 --> 14:18.469
I know. I know it sucks.
The guy's a tool.

14:20.506 --> 14:23.635
Booker, did you know Sanders,
the CIA SOG guy I'm replacing?

14:24.243 --> 14:25.540
- Yeah, the sniper?
- Yeah.

14:25.712 --> 14:27.942
No, he and Sabatino
kept to themselves.

14:28.114 --> 14:30.674
- Were they friends?
- Hard to tell.

14:30.850 --> 14:33.114
You know spooks,
everything's top secret.

15:10.856 --> 15:13.484
- Elise Jaeger?
- Yes?

15:13.659 --> 15:16.356
Detective Marty Deeks, L.A.P.D.
You got a minute?

15:16.528 --> 15:18.292
Uh, not really. What is this about?

15:18.463 --> 15:20.363
It's about two bodies we found
last night

15:20.532 --> 15:22.626
and a shoe with your fingerprints
at the crime scene.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.235
Look, I really need this job.

15:24.403 --> 15:26.599
I am clean and sober three months,
but my boss...

15:26.772 --> 15:29.571
Elise, is there a problem?

15:29.741 --> 15:30.765
No problem.

15:31.977 --> 15:33.672
Detective Marty Deeks, L.A.P.D.

15:35.047 --> 15:37.277
Elise here, um,

15:38.450 --> 15:40.530
has been helping us close in
on a counterfeiting ring

15:40.686 --> 15:42.780
that has been targeting
local businesses.

15:42.955 --> 15:44.320
What?

15:44.489 --> 15:45.786
I'm so sorry for the confusion,

15:45.958 --> 15:47.926
but she was under strict orders
not to mention it,

15:48.093 --> 15:50.425
but I can assure you
that she's saved your store

15:50.596 --> 15:52.836
over several hundred dollars
in the last couple of weeks.

15:52.998 --> 15:55.626
- Really?
- Getting close to busting these guys,

15:55.801 --> 15:57.064
but I do need a favor from you.

15:57.236 --> 15:58.965
If we could borrow her
for a couple hours,

15:59.137 --> 16:01.401
we got to take her downtown,
show her some mug shots.

16:01.573 --> 16:02.768
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

16:02.941 --> 16:04.221
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

16:04.376 --> 16:06.310
- You ready?
- Yeah. Thank you.

16:06.478 --> 16:08.003
You're welcome.

16:12.351 --> 16:14.683
Sam, you got a name?

16:15.454 --> 16:16.922
Yeah.

16:17.089 --> 16:19.524
It's Kiril Melnyk.

16:19.691 --> 16:20.920
Have L.A.P.D. pick him up,

16:21.093 --> 16:22.959
ask them to sit on him
for a couple of days.

16:23.128 --> 16:24.960
Give his girls a chance to relocate.

16:25.130 --> 16:27.531
- You got it.
- Out.

16:28.734 --> 16:29.826
Piece of work.

16:30.002 --> 16:31.094
Think she'll be okay?

16:31.270 --> 16:33.898
She's better off than she was
an hour ago.

16:34.072 --> 16:37.064
I'll have somebody from the local
Ukrainian community reach out to her.

16:37.242 --> 16:38.607
I can check in on her after work.

16:38.777 --> 16:41.906
Or tomorrow,
since we have our dinner tonight.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.913
Oh, and wear a suit and tie.
It's a nice place.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.211
- What?
- Yeah.

16:47.386 --> 16:51.118
This is L.A.
Funeral directors don't even wear ties.

16:51.290 --> 16:53.730
Seriously, do you even know anyone
that owns a tie these days?

16:54.526 --> 16:56.722
- Honestly.
- Adults?

16:57.329 --> 16:59.058
Let's go.

16:59.231 --> 17:00.630
Let's go.

17:09.574 --> 17:12.737
You can barely get a tie around
that telephone pole you call a neck.

17:12.911 --> 17:15.881
I happen to know Hetty
has those ties custom-made for you.

17:16.048 --> 17:18.517
Probably by some circus folk.

17:18.684 --> 17:21.381
This coming from a guy who thinks
black jeans are formal wear.

17:21.553 --> 17:23.353
I can clean up
when the occasion calls for it.

17:23.521 --> 17:26.787
Okay, well, tonight
the occasion is calling.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.921
Oh, God.

17:30.529 --> 17:32.964
You know what? Forget it.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.192
- Dialing.
- What are you doing?

17:37.369 --> 17:38.928
Calling Michelle.

17:39.371 --> 17:40.930
Tell her I don't wanna wear the suit?

17:41.106 --> 17:42.835
She would wanna know.

17:47.012 --> 17:48.946
Okay, okay.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.849
- I'll wear the suit.
- Thank you.

17:52.017 --> 17:54.315
Can't believe you were gonna use
Michelle to threaten me.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.420
Can't believe you caved.

17:56.588 --> 18:00.456
For the record, I, unlike you,
am not afraid of your wife.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.686
Yeah, yeah. You're not that stupid.

18:06.198 --> 18:07.324
Suit.

18:09.901 --> 18:11.665
Man.

18:12.671 --> 18:14.662
- What'd you find?
- Nothing.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.706
Sabatino appears to be clean.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.866
That's good, right?

18:19.044 --> 18:21.411
I still think I should tell someone.

18:21.580 --> 18:24.242
Well, you did. You told me.
And no one knows you told me,

18:24.416 --> 18:27.909
so if something happens
to you and Kensi, I know.

18:28.153 --> 18:30.019
Wait, what's gonna happen
to me and Kensi?

18:30.188 --> 18:31.917
I don't know. But just in case,

18:32.090 --> 18:34.491
I should probably create a file
with a dead man's switch.

18:34.659 --> 18:36.619
That way, if something happens
to you and to Kensi

18:36.762 --> 18:37.882
and something happens to me,

18:38.030 --> 18:40.110
it will automatically go out
to the rest of the team.

18:40.265 --> 18:41.699
Wait, what are you talking about?

18:41.867 --> 18:44.564
Okay, if someone goes undercover
and it's so secret and dangerous

18:44.736 --> 18:46.670
only their boss knows,
but their boss gets killed

18:46.838 --> 18:50.035
or their boss is one of the bad guys,
and now you're in double danger

18:50.208 --> 18:52.142
because no one knows the truth.

18:52.310 --> 18:55.041
That wouldn't happen with my plan.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.060
Cool. Now you've officially
freaked me out,

18:57.215 --> 18:59.149
and I'm going to tell Hetty.

19:03.755 --> 19:06.019
I'm still gonna create
a dead man's switch.

19:06.191 --> 19:07.590
Hey, wait up.

19:14.266 --> 19:15.825
- Granger.
- Granger.

19:26.078 --> 19:30.015
Those two meerkats you got working
in Ops are getting stranger.

19:32.384 --> 19:37.584
It takes a special type of personality
to do what they do.

19:37.756 --> 19:40.589
Yeah, well, they're special, all right.

19:40.759 --> 19:41.920
I think they need a window.

19:42.094 --> 19:44.222
Or at least an exercise wheel.

19:46.364 --> 19:47.991
Owen,

19:48.300 --> 19:49.927
relax.

19:50.102 --> 19:55.541
I just brewed a fresh pot
of Makaibari Silver Tips.

19:55.707 --> 19:58.199
I... It's all good.

19:59.111 --> 20:02.274
Never really understood the appeal
of hot, dirty water.

20:02.447 --> 20:06.077
It takes an evolved palate.

20:06.818 --> 20:09.253
That's what they say
about head cheese.

20:14.559 --> 20:19.725
You seem extraordinarily irritable,
even for you.

20:20.165 --> 20:21.496
Thanks for noticing.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.967
You care to share?

20:24.903 --> 20:26.997
Yeah, it's about Blye.

20:27.606 --> 20:29.540
What about her?

20:29.708 --> 20:33.303
I'm starting to wonder
why you insisted on sending her.

20:34.279 --> 20:36.907
You needed someone
you could trust.

20:37.082 --> 20:38.846
And that's it?

20:40.452 --> 20:43.786
Could anything be more important
than that?

20:49.094 --> 20:51.529
I need to know about the guy
that you were with.

20:52.397 --> 20:53.523
Is he a regular?

20:54.266 --> 20:57.031
No, I told you, it was a one-off.
I never saw him before.

20:57.202 --> 20:58.966
What was his name?

20:59.337 --> 21:01.362
- David.
- Did you get a last name?

21:02.974 --> 21:04.169
What about a car?

21:05.010 --> 21:07.877
Oh, it was silver SUV.
A Lexus, I think.

21:08.046 --> 21:09.411
Okay, so walk me through it.

21:09.581 --> 21:12.846
Silver Lexus, he picks you up,
takes you to the alley. What happens?

21:16.454 --> 21:19.116
Well, he started touching my face,

21:19.524 --> 21:22.289
said how much he liked my eyes.

21:22.861 --> 21:25.762
Then suddenly, the window smashes,
before I can know what's happening,

21:25.931 --> 21:27.956
I'm being dragged out by my hair.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.658
Did they say anything?

21:29.834 --> 21:32.804
They told me to get lost and took off.
I didn't even look back.

21:34.306 --> 21:35.946
They say anything to David?
To each other?

21:36.107 --> 21:37.472
Say each other's names?

21:38.543 --> 21:40.841
Not that I heard.

21:41.112 --> 21:42.910
I thought they were gonna Kill me.

21:43.081 --> 21:46.540
I kept waiting for them to shoot me
in the back.

21:47.686 --> 21:50.053
They didn't. You're safe.

21:50.488 --> 21:51.580
You're okay.

21:51.756 --> 21:53.781
I'm gonna grab you some coffee.

21:57.262 --> 22:00.254
- She seems legit.
- Yeah.

22:00.599 --> 22:03.466
I gotta be honest,
I think she's telling the truth.

22:03.635 --> 22:06.730
- I agree.
- Anything you wanna ask her?

22:10.342 --> 22:14.142
- Did you find it?
- Silver Lexus SUV on Sierra Bonita

22:14.312 --> 22:15.552
around the time of the murders,

22:15.714 --> 22:18.240
registered to a Robert Brown.

22:18.416 --> 22:19.850
Guess where he used to work.

22:20.418 --> 22:23.115
I mean, my first instinct is SeaWorld,
but I'll go with D-7.

22:23.922 --> 22:24.946
You are correct, sir.

22:25.123 --> 22:27.182
Address is already on your GPS.

22:27.359 --> 22:28.485
We're out of here.

22:28.660 --> 22:31.288
I'll see if she can give a positive ID.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.812
- Clear.
- Clear.

23:05.563 --> 23:07.156
Bedroom suggests
our guy bugged out

23:07.332 --> 23:08.800
with some firepower.

23:08.967 --> 23:12.801
Either he got out of here in a hurry,
or someone else came looking for him.

23:13.371 --> 23:15.965
No clues to where he may have gone.

23:21.313 --> 23:22.838
Check it out.

23:27.752 --> 23:30.744
It's Brown acting all buddy-buddy
with the two dead guys from the alley.

23:32.057 --> 23:33.752
So why are they trying to kill him?

23:52.142 --> 23:53.541
It's Sunshine.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.177
- Kitty litter.
- Aah.

24:00.484 --> 24:03.545
I suggest you shop for your cats
on your own time, Jones.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.815
- I don't own any cats.
- We were just chasing down a lead

24:06.990 --> 24:08.617
on a suspect who has a cat...
Had a cat.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.351
We don't know
what happened to the cat.

24:10.527 --> 24:11.688
It's a missing cat. Ahem.

24:11.862 --> 24:13.125
Catnapped, kidnapped.

24:15.699 --> 24:17.224
What do you know about Blye?

24:17.400 --> 24:20.392
Bligh. He was mutinied by his crew
for being a martinet?

24:20.570 --> 24:22.470
But managed to travel
over 4,000 miles

24:22.639 --> 24:23.731
in a small launch to Timor.

24:24.307 --> 24:27.004
Not Captain Bligh, you idiots.

24:27.177 --> 24:28.645
Agent Blye.

24:28.812 --> 24:30.803
She's on a classified assignment.

24:30.981 --> 24:32.608
And we're not classified.

24:32.783 --> 24:34.114
So you're not in touch with her?

24:35.051 --> 24:36.610
I don't think we're allowed, are we?

24:36.787 --> 24:38.812
I don't know. Are we?

24:43.260 --> 24:44.386
You gonna check that?

24:44.561 --> 24:45.824
It's probably just my mom.

24:45.996 --> 24:47.657
On a secure work device?

24:47.831 --> 24:49.424
No.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.395
Ah! Callen and Sam are back.

24:51.568 --> 24:54.060
I... The...

25:01.077 --> 25:02.602
I like your facial hair.

25:02.779 --> 25:04.474
Makes you look like a pirate.

25:11.521 --> 25:13.819
Robert Brown,
former Army Intelligence.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.290
He worked for D-7 at the same time
as Richard Davis and James Miller,

25:17.460 --> 25:19.220
the two men who were found dead
in the alley.

25:19.362 --> 25:22.024
- They know each other from Army?
- Not as far as I can tell.

25:22.199 --> 25:24.930
I think they met after they started
working as private contractors.

25:25.101 --> 25:27.593
Okay, well, we know D-7
provides logistic, courier

25:27.771 --> 25:29.330
and security services worldwide

25:29.506 --> 25:31.702
using former military
and law enforcement personnel.

25:31.875 --> 25:35.004
We also know they were probably the
ones that killed Vice Admiral Gardner.

25:35.278 --> 25:36.575
Possibly to keep him quiet

25:36.746 --> 25:39.181
about their employees' war crimes
in Afghanistan.

25:39.349 --> 25:41.010
Shut down
because of our investigation?

25:41.184 --> 25:43.915
Well, officially
it was due to internal restructuring,

25:44.087 --> 25:47.022
which led them to the decision to
terminate their government contracts.

25:47.190 --> 25:50.888
Contracts worth, what,
about a billion dollars? I don't buy it.

25:51.061 --> 25:53.621
Even if these guys weren't
working for D-7 when they were killed,

25:53.763 --> 25:56.323
it could still be tied to something
that happened when they were.

25:56.399 --> 25:58.834
Yeah, probably,
but here's the real kicker.

25:59.002 --> 26:01.403
Two and a half weeks
after D-7 shut its doors,

26:01.571 --> 26:03.471
both Richard Davis
and James Miller

26:03.640 --> 26:05.802
were employed by a new company,

26:06.243 --> 26:08.007
- Durendell Securities.
- Let me guess.

26:08.178 --> 26:09.304
New name, same company.

26:09.479 --> 26:11.573
Winner winner, chicken dinner.

26:12.983 --> 26:16.180
Sam's right. Somebody had to have
picked up those government contracts.

26:16.353 --> 26:17.650
So I looked into it.

26:17.821 --> 26:20.256
D-7 basically shut its doors

26:20.423 --> 26:23.518
and reemerged
as a new out-of-state entity.

26:23.693 --> 26:25.559
Did you contact Durendell Securities?

26:25.729 --> 26:28.096
Not yet, I didn't wanna tip them off
that we were onto them.

26:28.265 --> 26:29.790
But Eric is currently searching

26:29.966 --> 26:31.934
for a way into their system
as we speak.

26:32.102 --> 26:34.628
What about our, uh, missing man
here, Robert Brown?

26:34.804 --> 26:36.670
Does he work
for Durendell Securities too?

26:36.840 --> 26:38.365
No.

26:38.541 --> 26:41.272
Or could be he saw something
over there he didn't like.

26:41.444 --> 26:43.674
Same thing they didn't want
the admiral talking about,

26:43.847 --> 26:45.487
which explains
why they tried to kill him.

26:45.615 --> 26:47.344
We need to find this guy
before they do.

26:47.517 --> 26:50.043
Kaleidoscope just got a hit
on Robert Brown's silver Lexus.

26:50.220 --> 26:53.121
Unfortunately,
it's in the parking lot of a bus station.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.816
If he bought that ticket with cash,
he didn't have to show ID.

26:55.992 --> 26:57.289
No way to know where he went.

26:57.460 --> 26:59.758
I've been looking through
surveillance video, but nothing.

26:59.930 --> 27:01.898
If he left last night,
he's got a huge head start.

27:02.065 --> 27:04.534
Guy could be on the beach in Mexico
by now.

27:04.701 --> 27:07.830
Well, we should hit the bus depot,
see if someone recognizes him,

27:08.004 --> 27:09.472
remembers what ticket he bought.

27:09.639 --> 27:11.129
Nail down when he parked the car.

27:11.308 --> 27:13.436
It'll narrow the list of buses
he could have been on.

27:13.610 --> 27:15.874
If we're lucky, he just arrived.

27:16.212 --> 27:19.238
I'll go back to the house, see if I can
find anything that gives us a hint.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.578
- Keep in touch.
- Al right.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.751
Hey, Granger.

27:24.921 --> 27:27.583
Assistant Director Granger. Sorry.

27:27.757 --> 27:30.385
Um, wanna to get some fresh air?

27:30.827 --> 27:32.317
What'd you have in mind?

27:32.862 --> 27:34.830
Come on,
I need some backup in the field.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.932
- Why not?
- Great.

28:14.104 --> 28:15.435
All right, listen up, people.

28:15.605 --> 28:18.472
We need everyone out of here
while we perform a security test. Now.

28:18.641 --> 28:20.234
- Okay.
- All right.

28:20.410 --> 28:22.105
Let's move. Let's move. Let's move.

28:25.315 --> 28:27.647
Your pet supply store called.

28:27.817 --> 28:29.683
We're going flying.

28:41.731 --> 28:43.893
Good morning, Sunshine.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.033
Nice to hear your voice again, Kensi.

28:48.571 --> 28:52.166
So you should be getting
the drone feed momentarily.

29:07.424 --> 29:08.823
You getting this yet?

29:09.426 --> 29:12.157
- Yup. We're online.
- All right.

29:12.328 --> 29:16.492
Switching controls over to you now.

29:16.666 --> 29:18.327
Look, Mom.

29:18.868 --> 29:20.267
I'm flying.

29:20.437 --> 29:22.735
Say hello, Kensi.

29:26.109 --> 29:28.601
- Come on.
- Seriously?

29:28.778 --> 29:31.440
- Come on.
- Will you back off?

29:31.614 --> 29:33.844
This is one thing
I am not gonna miss about L.A,

29:34.751 --> 29:36.549
traffic.

29:36.953 --> 29:39.388
What do you mean "miss"?
Where are you going?

29:40.390 --> 29:41.824
I don't know.

29:41.991 --> 29:43.857
Somewhere they don't have cars.

29:44.027 --> 29:45.552
Catalina?

29:46.162 --> 29:49.462
You'd look really cute
driving one of those golf carts.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.995
With your little margarita.

29:53.970 --> 29:55.870
- Hey!
- Come on, let the cars through!

29:56.039 --> 29:57.803
- Hey, hey!
- Come on, move!

29:59.609 --> 30:01.236
It's Brown.

30:01.845 --> 30:04.280
- You got these guys?
- Oh, yeah.

30:08.384 --> 30:10.751
- Federal agents!
- Ugh!

30:13.456 --> 30:14.480
Federal agents!

30:18.428 --> 30:19.953
Brown!

30:46.522 --> 30:49.719
You should have just let me leave.
I'd be safer on my own.

30:49.892 --> 30:51.724
You're safe here.

30:52.361 --> 30:55.160
- You don't know these guys.
- Why do they want you dead?

30:58.333 --> 30:59.459
Come on.

31:00.702 --> 31:03.797
Look, some bad stuff went down
in Afghanistan.

31:03.972 --> 31:06.031
These guys are willing to kill
to keep it quiet.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.969
They got the Defense Department
in their back pocket.

31:09.144 --> 31:10.976
They got half the Pentagon
on speed dial.

31:11.146 --> 31:13.274
You guys cannot protect me
from them.

31:13.448 --> 31:14.813
Yes, we can.

31:14.983 --> 31:17.145
In fact, we already have.

31:19.054 --> 31:20.522
Wanna know what happened?

31:20.689 --> 31:22.453
Ask the guys that were chasing me.

31:22.624 --> 31:24.285
We will.

31:24.459 --> 31:26.951
But one of them's in surgery
and the other one's unconscious.

31:27.663 --> 31:29.062
You're welcome.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.135
There's no way I'm gonna testify
against these guys

31:34.303 --> 31:36.032
unless I'm granted full immunity

31:36.738 --> 31:39.002
and given a new identity.

31:39.174 --> 31:41.973
I don't wanna wind up dead.

31:50.185 --> 31:52.745
Are you in communication
with Blye?

31:53.288 --> 31:54.881
Not really.

31:55.057 --> 31:58.322
What the hell does "not really" mean?
Either you are or you aren't.

31:58.493 --> 32:00.257
Well, her operation is classified, sir.

32:00.429 --> 32:02.625
So she hasn't said anything to you
about her mission?

32:02.798 --> 32:05.768
No. Why?
What's going on over there?

32:11.607 --> 32:14.508
All right.
Ahem, Kensi and I aren't just partners.

32:17.512 --> 32:21.107
She's my friend,
and I look out for her.

32:21.283 --> 32:24.116
And so I'm asking you man-to-man,

32:24.286 --> 32:26.516
is there something
I should know about?

32:26.688 --> 32:28.713
Not really.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.446
Can I help you?

32:57.586 --> 33:00.055
Hands on your head.
Turn around slowly.

33:03.458 --> 33:05.324
Down on your knees.

33:05.994 --> 33:07.484
Come on.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.129
And cross your ankles.

33:16.938 --> 33:18.406
Now you lower your gun.

33:19.474 --> 33:21.135
Lower it.

33:22.110 --> 33:24.272
And get on your knees.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.475
Cross your ankles.

33:29.785 --> 33:32.516
Now touch your left ear
with your right hand

33:32.788 --> 33:35.621
- and your right ear with your left hand.
- What?

33:35.791 --> 33:39.022
I thought we were playing Gun Twister.
Are we not playing Gun Twister?

33:39.194 --> 33:41.356
You couldn't come out
before he made me get down

33:41.530 --> 33:42.827
on my bad knee?

33:43.999 --> 33:45.330
Not really.

33:47.102 --> 33:49.264
- What's up, Eric?
- Deeks and Granger just caught

33:49.438 --> 33:51.133
a Durendell Securities employee

33:51.306 --> 33:55.243
- breaking into Robert Brown's house.
- Tell them to sit tight, we'll be there.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.344
And send Nell over to babysit
till we get back.

33:57.512 --> 33:58.911
Got it.

34:06.021 --> 34:10.288
One of these guys better be a lawyer,
or you're all screwed.

34:11.226 --> 34:12.887
Told him
I used to be a public defender,

34:13.061 --> 34:15.962
but for some reason,
he declined my services.

34:16.130 --> 34:17.155
That's funny.

34:17.331 --> 34:18.561
He's pretty feisty for a guy

34:18.734 --> 34:20.793
who could be looking at jail time
for war crimes.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.168
You're gonna have to do better
than that.

34:23.338 --> 34:24.897
Actually, we don't.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.235
We have Robert Brown
in protective custody.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.503
- Protective custody?
- Mm-hm.

34:29.678 --> 34:31.703
You better have his ass in a cage.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.245
What's that supposed to mean?

34:34.882 --> 34:38.148
Like I said, I want a lawyer.

34:41.123 --> 34:44.388
Here. Call your lawyer.

34:57.406 --> 34:59.738
Why are you trying to kill Brown?

35:00.876 --> 35:03.038
The next one's going in your head.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.206
He killed three women
in Afghanistan.

35:09.317 --> 35:12.116
We got him out of there
as soon as we found out.

35:12.721 --> 35:15.656
Tried to stop him
before he did the same here.

35:17.259 --> 35:18.852
Guy's a psycho.

35:20.695 --> 35:22.993
- Hello.
- Hey.

35:23.165 --> 35:25.600
So can I get you anything?

35:26.201 --> 35:27.691
What happened to the other guys?

35:27.869 --> 35:30.099
Oh, they just had
to go check on something.

35:32.808 --> 35:35.038
So you're the only one here
to protect me?

35:35.544 --> 35:36.705
Yup.

35:38.013 --> 35:39.071
Are you an agent?

35:39.581 --> 35:41.948
Well, technically, I'm an analyst.

35:43.919 --> 35:45.114
Lucky me.

35:56.164 --> 35:57.563
Everything okay?

35:58.033 --> 35:59.831
Just my mom.

36:05.841 --> 36:07.240
I'm gonna call her back.

36:09.177 --> 36:10.303
Okay.

36:11.646 --> 36:12.772
Okay.

36:21.723 --> 36:23.213
No!

37:18.380 --> 37:19.404
Nell?

37:21.316 --> 37:22.909
You all right? Nell?

37:25.020 --> 37:27.182
- Nell?
- Did I get him?

37:28.690 --> 37:31.022
Yeah. You got him.

37:31.192 --> 37:32.284
Good.

37:41.303 --> 37:43.032
I'll call an ambulance.

37:48.610 --> 37:50.772
Not bad for an analyst.

37:56.885 --> 37:58.512
Are you all right?

37:58.687 --> 38:00.086
Yep.

38:04.559 --> 38:06.926
Good girl.

38:10.565 --> 38:12.363
Up you go.

38:13.568 --> 38:14.729
Big stones, Jones.

38:22.344 --> 38:24.642
Robert Brown's stable.

38:25.113 --> 38:28.048
My guess is he'll make a plea bargain
against D-7

38:28.216 --> 38:31.208
to save him from the death penalty.
It's too bad.

38:31.386 --> 38:33.354
Indeed.

38:34.656 --> 38:36.317
Your people did well.

38:36.491 --> 38:38.960
They always do.

38:44.399 --> 38:46.197
I told you,

38:46.368 --> 38:48.200
I'm gonna stop letting you
leave Ops.

38:48.370 --> 38:49.735
Thank you. Heh.

38:49.904 --> 38:51.235
Hey, hey, hey.

38:51.406 --> 38:52.430
I know.

38:55.677 --> 38:56.940
Kensi calling on her sat phone.

38:58.013 --> 39:00.744
- Yeah, this is Nell.
- Hey.

39:00.915 --> 39:03.145
- Did you find him?
- Uh, yeah.

39:03.318 --> 39:06.811
He traveled another eight
and a half kilometers northeast on foot

39:06.988 --> 39:08.080
where he met three men.

39:08.256 --> 39:09.746
- Ours?
- Hard to say.

39:09.924 --> 39:11.153
They're all in local attire.

39:11.893 --> 39:13.520
- Could you identify them?
- No.

39:13.695 --> 39:15.720
I had to keep the drone high
to avoid detection.

39:15.897 --> 39:19.492
Its optics aren't good enough
for facial recognition at that distance.

39:19.668 --> 39:21.432
I sent you the coordinates
and the footage.

39:21.603 --> 39:23.162
Maybe you can make
something out.

39:23.338 --> 39:25.670
- Okay. Thanks.
- / also sent you

39:25.840 --> 39:29.037
what I found on Sabatino,
but it's not much so far.

39:29.210 --> 39:32.373
There's no reason given
for pulling him off the Sidorov case,

39:32.547 --> 39:36.643
and the incident report he filed
on the death of CIA Officer Sanders

39:36.818 --> 39:38.183
is pretty thin.

39:39.187 --> 39:40.882
There was nobody else with them
that day,

39:41.056 --> 39:44.082
so Sabatino's account
is the only one on record.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.819
All right, keep digging.

39:46.995 --> 39:49.692
- Maybe something will turn up.
- You got it.

39:50.098 --> 39:52.123
Everything okay back there?

39:52.300 --> 39:55.497
Yeah. Just another day at the office.

39:57.806 --> 39:59.831
Mr. Callen?

40:02.210 --> 40:05.339
- What's this?
- A suit and shirt.

40:05.947 --> 40:08.541
- Sam.
- Uh-huh.

40:08.917 --> 40:11.909
Uh, shoes and socks
should be outside your locker.

40:12.087 --> 40:14.988
Uh, I'm leaving undergarments
to you.

40:15.156 --> 40:16.385
Please use them.

40:16.558 --> 40:19.152
And you can return it all
tomorrow morning.

40:19.327 --> 40:21.853
Hetty, what is this all about?

40:22.330 --> 40:25.356
I think it's about
trying to make you presentable.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.763
No, no, no, I mean, what...?

40:27.936 --> 40:31.201
Heh. Never mind. Thank you.

40:32.073 --> 40:33.165
Yes, yes.

40:33.575 --> 40:35.566
Go on.

40:48.823 --> 40:50.655
He's not gonna like this.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.886
Well, it's for his own good.

41:01.903 --> 41:03.769
- I'm sorry, this isn't who...
- Callen?

41:04.339 --> 41:05.704
Hi, I'm Joelle.

41:05.874 --> 41:09.572
- My friends call me Joe.
- Hi.

41:09.744 --> 41:11.405
I just got a text
from Sam and Michelle.

41:11.579 --> 41:13.775
They said they're having car trouble
and running late,

41:13.948 --> 41:17.316
so I, um, ordered a drink. Heh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

41:17.485 --> 41:21.046
I just didn't know until now
that they had invited anyone else.

41:21.689 --> 41:23.680
That makes two of us.

41:23.858 --> 41:25.417
I guess this is me.

41:25.593 --> 41:27.823
- Can I get you a drink?
- What are you having?

41:27.996 --> 41:30.431
A vodka martini, just a little bit dirty.

41:31.099 --> 41:32.260
Girl after my own taste.

41:33.101 --> 41:35.092
- I will have the same.
- Absolutely.

41:35.270 --> 41:36.533
Thanks.

41:38.072 --> 41:39.972
- So...
- So, ha-ha-ha.

41:40.241 --> 41:44.701
Um, should I call Sam and Michelle,
in case they need a ride or something?

41:44.879 --> 41:48.008
Oh, actually, wait.
This is probably them. Sorry.

41:50.952 --> 41:52.113
Oh, heh.

41:54.422 --> 41:55.685
Don't tell me.

41:55.857 --> 41:57.291
They're not coming.

41:57.926 --> 41:58.950
How'd you know that?

42:00.795 --> 42:02.923
That was a, uh, lucky guess.

42:06.367 --> 42:08.301
I guess we can leave.

42:09.270 --> 42:11.602
Yeah. Uh...

42:12.307 --> 42:18.269
Although I just ordered a drink,
and I'm actually starving.

42:20.348 --> 42:22.976
But you're more than welcome to go
if you'd like.

42:23.151 --> 42:25.483
- Honestly.
- No, no, I'm fine to stay.

42:25.653 --> 42:27.178
I haven't eaten either, so...

42:29.224 --> 42:31.022
So, ha, ha.

42:32.393 --> 42:34.418
- For you.
- Thank you.

42:36.798 --> 42:38.493
So how do you know
Sam and Michelle?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.396
Oh, I taught their daughter
in kindergarten.

42:42.303 --> 42:44.670
- Teacher.
- Yeah.

42:44.973 --> 42:46.168
Nice.

42:48.142 --> 42:50.873
Do you work in the medical
equipment field with Sam?

42:51.913 --> 42:55.645
No. I'm in securities.

42:57.018 --> 42:58.986
- Yeah.
- That's interesting. Heh.

42:59.153 --> 43:01.417
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

43:01.589 --> 43:04.217
- To, uh, Sam and Michelle.
- Michelle.
