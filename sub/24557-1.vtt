00:35.491 --> 00:36.824
I'm honoured to
be here today

00:36.826 --> 00:39.897
to celebrate the life
of a great man...

00:41.398 --> 00:44.502
a great husband
and a great father.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.437
The releasing of these
ashes into the sea

00:49.439 --> 00:51.473
represents a
return to home.

00:51.475 --> 00:53.777
Life and death
is a great mystery.

00:54.911 --> 00:57.414
We are summoned to
this world, and then...

00:58.615 --> 00:59.881
called upon
to return,

00:59.883 --> 01:03.585
God's vast plan
and purpose so deep

01:03.587 --> 01:06.524
that our
understanding fails...

01:07.625 --> 01:09.793
and our reason
cannot follow.

01:12.263 --> 01:15.800
Sean, would you like
to say a few words?

01:21.537 --> 01:23.604
I didn't
prepare anything.

02:01.344 --> 02:05.079

04:23.454 --> 04:25.820
What's up, my man?
Can I help you?

04:25.822 --> 04:28.459
Hey! No,
I'm OK. Thanks.

05:06.863 --> 05:08.632
Hi!

05:11.201 --> 05:13.868
Does Henry Barnes live here?

05:13.870 --> 05:16.837
He used to.
Who's asking?

05:16.839 --> 05:18.606
My name's Sean.

05:18.608 --> 05:19.841
OK.

05:19.843 --> 05:21.976
Uh, see, I...

05:21.978 --> 05:23.844
Um, how do you
know my stepfather?

05:23.846 --> 05:25.680
We... we're old friends.

05:25.682 --> 05:26.848
Old friends?

05:26.850 --> 05:30.851
Yeah. Um...

05:30.853 --> 05:33.221
Do you know
where he lives now?

05:33.223 --> 05:34.990
He's out of
town right now.

05:34.992 --> 05:37.959
I'm guessing he'll be back
to LA in a couple days.

05:37.961 --> 05:39.127
You can see him then.

05:39.129 --> 05:41.562
All right. Well...

05:41.564 --> 05:45.469
- Hey! Scott, was it?
- Sean.

05:47.036 --> 05:49.003
Are you nervous?

05:49.005 --> 05:53.076
You look like you could use
a glass or two of water.

06:00.850 --> 06:04.221
OK. How do I say this?

06:05.788 --> 06:08.022
I'm not an old friend of his.

06:08.024 --> 06:10.727
I've never even met him before.

06:13.196 --> 06:16.031
I found this letter on my
car windshield yesterday

06:16.033 --> 06:19.034
when I was on the way back
from my father's funeral.

06:19.036 --> 06:22.002
- Your father's funeral?
- Yeah.

06:22.004 --> 06:24.805
The letter was
written anonymously,

06:24.807 --> 06:26.274
but as you can see,

06:26.276 --> 06:29.247
I have this address
and I have a name.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.781
Apparently, your stepdad
is also my half-brother.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.750
That's
pretty insane!

06:36.752 --> 06:38.152
Tell me about it.

06:38.154 --> 06:40.322
I don't know what
the hell to believe

06:40.324 --> 06:42.627
or who could have
written the letter.

06:43.994 --> 06:46.627
What can you
tell me about him?

06:46.629 --> 06:48.964
Henry? He was a writer.

06:48.966 --> 06:52.099
Um... He even wrote a book
that got published.

06:53.235 --> 06:55.769
But then he fell into
some hard times,

06:55.771 --> 06:58.772
and he hasn't really
written anything since.

06:58.774 --> 07:01.745
Listen,
he's a drunk.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.945
He's a criminal.

07:03.947 --> 07:06.848
And he's definitely
not to be trusted.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.319
And...

07:10.286 --> 07:11.685
he's a murderer.

07:11.687 --> 07:12.786
What?

07:12.788 --> 07:14.255
He killed a woman.

07:14.257 --> 07:18.058
There was a trial,
but he got off.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.695
If you get involved with him,
I can promise you this:

07:21.697 --> 07:24.332
You're gonna be dragged down
into a world

07:24.334 --> 07:26.668
you don't wanna
go anywhere near.

07:26.670 --> 07:30.074
This is a lot of information
to process at one time.

07:33.175 --> 07:35.243
I should, uh,
get going.

07:35.245 --> 07:36.411
Oh yeah? OK.

07:36.413 --> 07:39.680
Uh, well, it was
nice meeting you.

07:39.682 --> 07:41.348
- You too.
- Uh-huh.

07:41.350 --> 07:43.250
- Yeah.

09:39.503 --> 09:41.002
<i>He's got a fruit stand</i>

09:41.004 --> 09:43.470
on a street corner
somewhere downtown.

09:43.472 --> 09:45.873
A fruit stand?
I'd never have guessed.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.374
How could you have?

09:47.376 --> 09:48.445
What kind of fruit?

09:49.413 --> 09:51.246
Um, I think he deals
exclusively in mangoes,

09:51.248 --> 09:52.513
but I could be wrong.

09:52.515 --> 09:53.516
I'm just curious:

09:55.152 --> 09:56.984
Why did you tell me he
was out of town yesterday?

09:56.986 --> 09:59.853
I was hoping I could
convince you not to meet him.

09:59.855 --> 10:01.022
But if
you're dead set

10:01.024 --> 10:03.090
on finding your
long lost, evil brother,

10:03.092 --> 10:04.358
I guess I'll
help you out.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.393
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

10:06.395 --> 10:07.862
Is this your car?

10:07.864 --> 10:11.000
Yeah. She's a pretty
sweet ride, isn't she?

10:29.485 --> 10:31.419
From what you
told me about him,

10:31.421 --> 10:33.921
I can't picture him
working at a fruit stand.

10:33.923 --> 10:36.391
Well, it's not your
average fruit stand.

10:36.393 --> 10:38.560
"Mango" is a code word for meth.

10:38.562 --> 10:40.261
What do you mean?

10:40.263 --> 10:44.132
I mean he uses the fruit stand
as a cover for his drug sales.

10:44.134 --> 10:48.169
- Drug sales?
- Yeah, Henry's a drug lord.

10:48.171 --> 10:51.039
- What?
- I thought I told you this!

10:51.041 --> 10:52.406
No!

10:52.408 --> 10:55.980
Oh! Well, I did say
he was dangerous, didn't I?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.519
You still want to meet him?

11:03.419 --> 11:05.320
Yeah.

11:05.322 --> 11:07.287
It's your funeral.

11:14.998 --> 11:19.600
OK, I think he used to
work that corner right there,

11:19.602 --> 11:23.438
but I guess he recently moved.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.939
So, how do we find him?

11:24.941 --> 11:27.574
Well, he's got about
5 different locales

11:27.576 --> 11:29.243
that he
circles between,

11:29.245 --> 11:31.112
so eventually,
we should find him.

11:31.114 --> 11:33.348
I gotta warn
you, though:

11:33.350 --> 11:35.483
Once we get close
to Henry's turf,

11:35.485 --> 11:38.288
things might get
a little crazy, OK?

11:40.456 --> 11:42.089
Why?

11:42.091 --> 11:44.160
Because he's
a drug lord.

11:57.173 --> 11:58.373
Oh, shit!

11:58.375 --> 12:00.108
What's going on?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.975
Don't turn around.

12:01.977 --> 12:04.112
There's a guy behind us
in a red car.

12:04.114 --> 12:07.382
It's Henry's ex-partner, and he
owes him a shit ton of money.

12:07.384 --> 12:10.251
This guy will go after
anyone close to Henry to get it.

12:10.253 --> 12:12.954
- Bloody hell!
- Bloody hell is right.

12:12.956 --> 12:15.489
OK, I'm pretty sure he's
ID'd me. You need to get down.

12:15.491 --> 12:18.526
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious! Get down.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.527
I don't want him
to ID you too!

12:20.529 --> 12:22.262
How much money
does Henry owe?

12:22.264 --> 12:24.132
Enough to sleep
with one eye open.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.667
Now you think this thug
ex-partner guy is after you?

12:26.669 --> 12:28.502
Well, yeah,
that's what thugs do!

12:28.504 --> 12:29.472
They come after you.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.141
Ah...

12:33.143 --> 12:35.575
OK, hold on to your
tea and biscuits.

12:35.577 --> 12:37.512
I gotta lose this guy.

12:37.514 --> 12:40.982
- Oh, for goodness' sake!
- Didn't I tell you to get down?

12:40.984 --> 12:43.151
Stop looking back.
They'll ID you!

12:43.153 --> 12:45.185
They? You said one
ex-partner thug guy.

12:45.187 --> 12:47.321
These assholes
always travel in pairs.

12:49.692 --> 12:51.427
Watch out! Ah!

12:55.398 --> 12:57.565
Why are you driving
on the sidewalk right now?

12:57.567 --> 12:59.400
Watch out for this guy!

12:59.402 --> 13:01.469
- Don't worry, I got this.
- Ah!

13:01.471 --> 13:02.505
Whoa!

13:04.341 --> 13:07.407
I feel like I'm in
<i>The French Connection</i> right now.

13:07.409 --> 13:08.743
The French what?

13:10.212 --> 13:13.918
Whoa! Be careful!

13:21.291 --> 13:23.590
Stop talking
and duck your head down.

13:23.592 --> 13:25.663
OK, OK!

13:41.778 --> 13:43.614
You can come up now.

13:56.725 --> 13:59.495
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:01.663 --> 14:04.065
You're a
sensational driver.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.233
Well, thank you.

14:06.602 --> 14:08.171
Mmm...

14:22.684 --> 14:24.320
Hey...

14:28.691 --> 14:30.791
Have you ever
been in love?

14:32.361 --> 14:33.730
Yes.

14:35.065 --> 14:36.696
You?

14:36.698 --> 14:38.368
Yes.

14:42.471 --> 14:45.105
Tell me a secret,

14:45.107 --> 14:48.776
something nobody
else knows.

14:48.778 --> 14:50.614
A secret?

14:51.581 --> 14:54.018
Hmm. Um...

14:56.318 --> 14:58.254
- I...
- OK, fine. I'll go.

15:00.590 --> 15:03.394
I'm killing myself
two weeks from today.

15:06.863 --> 15:08.265
What?

15:09.264 --> 15:10.800
I'm serious.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.302
You're not happy?

15:15.304 --> 15:18.041
Happiness has nothing
to do with it.

15:23.413 --> 15:25.713
Why are you
telling me this?

15:25.715 --> 15:29.052
I don't know. I figured
I should tell someone.

15:33.623 --> 15:35.826
Why would
you do that?

15:37.826 --> 15:40.129
Why do you
care, anyway?

15:41.498 --> 15:43.631
Because I have
a conscience.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.537
Is that the only
reason you care?

16:30.179 --> 16:33.347
So, we're just supposed to
hang out for the next two weeks

16:33.349 --> 16:34.549
until you
kill yourself?

16:34.551 --> 16:36.550
I never said
I wanted to spend

16:36.552 --> 16:38.652
the last two weeks
of my life with you.

16:38.654 --> 16:39.722
Oh.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.223
I'm kidding.

I've always had it

17:35.979 --> 17:38.278
I could see it all

is he was abandoned by
his father, your father.

18:55.325 --> 18:57.658
And you know who
he was left with?

18:57.660 --> 18:59.693
His alcoholic mother.

18:59.695 --> 19:03.396
She abused the shit out
of him when he was a kid, OK?

19:03.398 --> 19:05.365
Horrible things
went down.

19:05.367 --> 19:07.567

to meet your dad,

get a chance to.

19:11.007 --> 19:13.540

19:13.542 --> 19:15.811
You know who
he hates even more?

19:16.913 --> 19:18.749
- Who?
- You.

19:19.981 --> 19:22.083
Well, how do
you figure that?

19:22.085 --> 19:25.419
Your father left him
with his fucked-up mother

19:25.421 --> 19:27.421
so he could start
his new family.

19:27.423 --> 19:30.091
You're everything
he could have been.

19:30.093 --> 19:33.427
You tell him you're
his half-brother,

19:33.429 --> 19:35.595
and he'll kill you.

19:44.539 --> 19:48.441
How do you even know
that he's guilty, though?

19:48.443 --> 19:49.809
I mean, he got off.

19:49.811 --> 19:53.382
Why are you so sure
that he killed that woman?

19:55.884 --> 19:57.584
Well...

19:59.122 --> 20:01.692
...because that
woman was my mother.

20:04.026 --> 20:06.063
Here's your smoke.

20:17.539 --> 20:19.873
If you ever see that man,

20:19.875 --> 20:23.143
I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

20:23.145 --> 20:26.682
I didn't know. I...
I'm really sorry.

20:27.650 --> 20:29.119
It's OK.

20:39.528 --> 20:42.833
What makes you so certain
that he killed your mother?

20:47.537 --> 20:49.036
Get out!

20:49.038 --> 20:50.871
What?

20:50.873 --> 20:52.873
Now!

20:52.875 --> 20:56.142
I didn't mean
to upset you, though.

20:56.144 --> 20:59.048
Apology accepted.
Now please leave!

21:01.451 --> 21:04.621
- Sean, out!
- OK!

21:05.621 --> 21:07.124
Go!

22:06.749 --> 22:08.785
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:10.286 --> 22:13.120
- Can I come in?
- No!

22:13.122 --> 22:14.955
I need to
talk to you.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.758
Well, talk.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.529
OK.

22:21.696 --> 22:23.466
Um...

22:25.634 --> 22:28.605
I don't know how to
say this, other than...

22:30.306 --> 22:32.107
can we
start over?

22:33.776 --> 22:37.581
What I said, questioning
you about Henry...

22:38.948 --> 22:40.684
and your mother...

22:41.951 --> 22:43.953
I had no right.

22:45.855 --> 22:47.757
I don't need
to see him.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.229
I'd much rather
continue to see you...

22:54.195 --> 22:55.965
if that's
all right.

23:07.009 --> 23:09.112
That would be nice.

23:11.079 --> 23:13.582
I want to
take you out.

23:18.988 --> 23:21.857
- Like, on a date?
- Yeah.

23:24.993 --> 23:27.663
Any place in mind
you'd like to go?

23:39.709 --> 23:42.676
- What are we doing here?
- I need a new dildo.

23:42.678 --> 23:46.046
Cool! All right.
Um, you got a lot of choice.

23:46.048 --> 23:47.981
This looks
like a cactus.

23:47.983 --> 23:49.984
Can I help you with anything?

23:49.986 --> 23:51.352
Oh, no. No, no.
We're good.

23:51.354 --> 23:52.655
We're just
looking around.

23:53.656 --> 23:54.657
Actually, I'm looking
for a new vibrator.

23:55.525 --> 23:57.091
Do you have any that
you would recommend?

23:57.093 --> 24:00.094
We have a wide range
of dildos and vibrators,

24:00.096 --> 24:01.862
and, of course,
vibrating dildos.

24:01.864 --> 24:03.863
Vibrators, we have
all your standards:

24:03.865 --> 24:06.400
your egg-shaped, your
wand, your bullet, etc.,

24:06.402 --> 24:09.103
both battery operated
and rechargeable.

24:09.105 --> 24:11.270
Uh, we have your
dual stimulation

24:11.272 --> 24:15.409
to get the Z-spot and
the G-spot simultaneously.

24:15.411 --> 24:17.378
We have ticklers.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.845
We have some
anal beads,

24:18.847 --> 24:20.847
butt plugs
and, oh, cock rings.

24:20.849 --> 24:23.116
Oh, we'd like to
know how those work.

24:23.118 --> 24:25.986
Absolutely!
Let me show you.

24:25.988 --> 24:28.421
- This is your cock ring.
- Mm-hmm.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.224
So, when you
bring in your penis,

24:30.226 --> 24:32.159
you can wear this
at different points

24:32.161 --> 24:34.228
to get different kinds
of stimulation.

24:34.230 --> 24:37.230
If you place it at the tip,
that's a good place to start.

24:37.232 --> 24:39.900
Now, if you want some
more testicular sensation,

24:39.902 --> 24:43.770
just move this
on down to the bottom,

24:43.772 --> 24:46.907
and there, the vibrations
go into the balls.

24:48.144 --> 24:48.877
Wow!

24:50.046 --> 24:51.081
Yeah. That's
really fascinating.

24:52.248 --> 24:54.280
- Thank you so much!
- Absolutely!

24:54.282 --> 24:57.383
Um. I think I'll
get this one.

24:57.385 --> 24:58.421
Great choice!

25:00.088 --> 25:01.124
I'll ring you up at the register
whenever you're ready.

25:02.791 --> 25:04.290
And we have lots of lube
as well, if you're interested.

25:04.292 --> 25:06.026
- Oh, perfect!
- Yeah!

25:06.028 --> 25:07.428
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:08.864 --> 25:10.430
How often do
you masturbate?

25:11.433 --> 25:13.199
I can't answer that.
I'm a lady.

25:13.201 --> 25:14.767
Hmm!

25:14.769 --> 25:15.902
Mmm...

25:15.904 --> 25:17.173
Thank you.

25:24.246 --> 25:27.948
Did you hate waking up
in the morning to work there?

25:27.950 --> 25:30.049
He fell off a roof
while laying brick

25:30.051 --> 25:32.452
on some rich guy's house
in Beverly Hills.

25:32.454 --> 25:34.220
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

I know I sort of peer-pressured
you into that one.

26:22.505 --> 26:26.974
It's OK. But you do
owe me now, so be aware.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.109
Well, how can I
ever repay you?

26:29.111 --> 26:31.344
Well, I don't
know yet.

26:31.346 --> 26:34.113
Well, uh, I do have a few
great natural talents.

26:34.115 --> 26:35.217
Oh!

26:36.951 --> 26:38.384
One of them is that I give
an incredible foot massage.

26:38.386 --> 26:41.087
- Hmm!
- It's a gift.

26:41.089 --> 26:44.824
OK, then. Let's
test your skills.

26:46.295 --> 26:48.264
OK...

26:51.567 --> 26:55.238
Come on, we're waiting,
my feet and I.

27:00.308 --> 27:02.241
OK.

27:08.284 --> 27:09.850
You look so nervous!

27:09.852 --> 27:10.851
What?

27:10.853 --> 27:13.019
I thought you
were good at this.

27:13.021 --> 27:15.055
I am! Oh my god!

27:15.057 --> 27:17.857
They're incredibly
cute feet.

27:17.859 --> 27:20.362
Maybe the cutest
I've ever seen.

27:23.031 --> 27:25.367
OK. Thanks,
I guess.

27:29.204 --> 27:30.437
Sean...

27:30.439 --> 27:31.939
Mm-hmm?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.173
You're kind of
terrible at this.

27:34.175 --> 27:37.411
I know. I just really
wanted to touch your feet.

27:43.085 --> 27:44.584
You can keep
massaging my feet,

27:44.586 --> 27:46.319
but, um, you're
not gonna kiss me

27:46.321 --> 27:47.554
or sleep with
me tonight.

27:47.556 --> 27:49.189
Oh, that's good,
that's good.

27:49.191 --> 27:51.924
I didn't want to kiss you
or sleep with you tonight.

27:51.926 --> 27:52.895
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

27:53.895 --> 27:55.228
Hmm.

here at night, sometimes.

28:33.035 --> 28:34.938
OK.

28:37.038 --> 28:38.907
Hold on,
hold on.

28:54.056 --> 28:55.625
Thank you.

29:14.710 --> 29:17.143
That... that
was fun today.

29:17.145 --> 29:18.947
Yeah, it was.

29:22.151 --> 29:25.251
Except for the
terribly disappointing

29:25.253 --> 29:26.719
foot-massage fiasco.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.587
Yes, minus that.

29:40.970 --> 29:42.505
So...

29:47.343 --> 29:49.646
What do you
want to do now?

30:12.768 --> 30:15.071
Looks like
we both lied.

30:17.006 --> 30:20.442
You also said you didn't
want to sleep with me.

30:29.518 --> 30:32.154
I'm in a lying
kind of mood right now.

30:35.490 --> 30:38.027
I only lie
once per day.

31:19.500 --> 31:23.472
Siren Seduction

31:24.740 --> 31:26.675
<i>Hmm...</i>

31:30.445 --> 31:33.180
<i>"The sight of her heaving bosoms</i>

31:33.182 --> 31:37.584
<i>"caused a torture inside him
he prayed would never end.</i>

<i>"He was powerless

32:01.175 --> 32:03.876

32:22.131 --> 32:25.498
Excuse me.
Are you Henry Barnes?

32:25.500 --> 32:28.567
Depends what mood
I'm in. Who's asking?

32:28.569 --> 32:31.872
I'm looking to write
an article on you.

32:31.874 --> 32:34.607
Look, if this
is about the trial,

32:34.609 --> 32:37.611
a court of law
saw fit to let me go.

32:37.613 --> 32:39.446
I don't do interviews.

32:39.448 --> 32:41.248
It wouldn't be
about the trial.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.883
Honestly, I don't know
anything about that, really.

32:43.885 --> 32:47.222
Um, I'd be more interested in
what you've been doing since.

32:49.724 --> 32:51.490
I really liked
your novel.

32:51.492 --> 32:53.192
You read my book?

32:53.194 --> 32:55.862
Yes. It's
really, um...

32:55.864 --> 32:57.796
Hey, Chris!
How's it going, man?

32:57.798 --> 32:58.797
All right.

32:58.799 --> 33:00.366
- The usual?
- Yep!

33:00.368 --> 33:02.635
Got something for you.
You got something for me?

33:02.637 --> 33:04.904
Yeah, man. You should
come by, have some mango.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.340
It was really
fascinating.

33:07.342 --> 33:08.878
What did you
like about it?

33:10.278 --> 33:13.513
How real it felt,
the characters.

33:13.515 --> 33:15.414
You're my one fan.

33:16.518 --> 33:18.218
I'm sure
that's not true.

33:18.220 --> 33:20.786
Shouldn't you be
in school or something?

33:20.788 --> 33:22.288
What are you, 16?

33:22.290 --> 33:23.458
I'm 24.

33:24.893 --> 33:26.927
I remember
when I was 24.

33:26.929 --> 33:28.795
It all seemed to
make sense.

33:28.797 --> 33:32.399
My whole life ahead of me,
my whole fucking life.

33:32.401 --> 33:33.699
What are you doing?

33:33.701 --> 33:36.638
I'm just taking down
a few notes for the article.

33:37.838 --> 33:39.706
How'd you find out
I was here?

33:39.708 --> 33:42.976
Um, I just got told that
you worked on a fruit stand

33:42.978 --> 33:44.911
on a street corner
in downtown.

33:44.913 --> 33:46.249
So I took
my chances.

33:47.282 --> 33:49.282
I started walking around,
hoping I'd find you,

33:49.284 --> 33:50.920
and, um, here you are!

33:56.857 --> 33:58.627
So, uh...

34:00.328 --> 34:02.365
you gonna buy
some mangoes or what?

34:03.999 --> 34:06.235
I'm OK, thanks.

34:07.236 --> 34:08.601
You don't
like mangoes?

34:08.603 --> 34:10.469
They're OK.

34:10.472 --> 34:13.304
I think you should
lay down some cash

34:13.306 --> 34:15.378
and have one of
these delicious treats.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.812
Fresh off the boat.

34:19.748 --> 34:21.280
Sure, OK.

34:21.282 --> 34:22.951
- I'll... I'll have one.
- Hmm.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.552
Does... does
that cover it?

34:26.554 --> 34:28.590
What else you
got in there?

34:30.626 --> 34:32.695
That'll do. Here.

34:35.429 --> 34:37.966
Eat one. Hmm?

34:41.902 --> 34:43.271
Put it in.

34:52.713 --> 34:54.416
Chew it.

34:57.918 --> 34:59.821
Slower.

35:03.525 --> 35:04.923
Mm-hmm.

35:06.594 --> 35:08.394
- Bag of mangoes, please.
- Yeah.

35:08.396 --> 35:09.896
- The mangoes fresh?
- Absolutely!

35:10.898 --> 35:11.833
How much for a bag?

35:12.668 --> 35:13.900
- $2. Just mangoes?
- Just mangoes.

35:13.902 --> 35:16.036
- You got a sweet tooth?
- Yeah.

35:16.038 --> 35:18.505
All right.
Enjoy! Stay healthy.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.309
Did you, um...

35:22.077 --> 35:23.913
Did you remarry?

35:25.813 --> 35:28.483
You think I
killed her, don't you?

35:29.451 --> 35:30.916
No, I don't.

35:30.918 --> 35:32.619
I don't know
anything about it.

35:32.621 --> 35:35.421
But you read about it.

35:35.423 --> 35:36.858
Yeah, a little.

35:37.958 --> 35:39.958
So, you want
to interview me,

35:39.960 --> 35:42.528
and you don't want to
talk about that?

35:42.530 --> 35:45.097
You said you didn't
want to talk about that.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.402
You fucking with me, kid?

35:48.903 --> 35:51.641
No, I swear!

35:54.576 --> 35:56.278
I didn't do it.

35:59.114 --> 36:00.750
OK.

36:17.465 --> 36:18.831
Hey!

36:18.833 --> 36:21.770
Hi! What have you been up to?

36:22.771 --> 36:24.537
Oh, a little bit of this,

36:24.539 --> 36:25.704
a little bit of that.

36:25.706 --> 36:26.675
What are you doing?

36:27.742 --> 36:29.809
Cigarettes and laundry.

36:29.811 --> 36:33.548
- Sounds like fun.
- Tons.

36:35.016 --> 36:36.615
Can I join you?

36:36.617 --> 36:39.054
Yes, you shall.

36:41.789 --> 36:45.992
Why do laundry if you're gonna
just end it all in a few weeks?

36:45.994 --> 36:48.561
I'm civilized,
and I like clean stuff.

36:49.864 --> 36:51.865
Don't you have
a mother back home

36:51.867 --> 36:53.032
who's worried about you?

36:53.034 --> 36:54.867
She's always worried about me.

36:54.869 --> 36:58.604
Have you told her about
what your father did,

36:58.606 --> 37:01.840
that you have
a half-brother?

37:01.842 --> 37:05.114
I don't know if it's anything
she even needs to know.

37:06.081 --> 37:07.613
It would crush her.

37:07.615 --> 37:09.782
She... she loved
my father very much.

37:09.784 --> 37:11.619
She respected him.

37:15.690 --> 37:18.023
She ever
tell you that,

37:18.025 --> 37:21.096
that she loves
and respects him?

37:26.835 --> 37:30.903
She was in love with him.

37:30.905 --> 37:33.576
Well, love is
a tricky thing.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.579
It can be pretty deceiving.

37:39.079 --> 37:40.914
You never wonder?

37:40.916 --> 37:42.916
Wonder what?

37:42.918 --> 37:44.920
Well, if it
was real or not.

37:46.121 --> 37:48.153
Well, I've been
trying to go through

37:48.155 --> 37:50.690
these moments in my head,

37:50.692 --> 37:52.795
images of my
parents, um...

37:54.128 --> 37:57.796
things my father said
to me through the years,

37:57.798 --> 38:01.503
things he's said
to my mother.

38:04.639 --> 38:07.907
And my mom can't ever
know about this.

38:07.909 --> 38:11.012
Shouldn't she know
the truth about him?

38:13.248 --> 38:15.951
Sometimes, it's
better not to know.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.658
Could you see yourself being
married to the same person...

38:24.759 --> 38:29.061
for, like, 30,
40, 50 years?

38:29.063 --> 38:31.900
So daunting to
think about it.

38:33.601 --> 38:35.503
I can
picture it.

38:37.005 --> 38:38.941
I just, um...

38:40.275 --> 38:42.575
can't imagine
being in a marriage

38:42.577 --> 38:45.181
with someone I wasn't
madly in love with.

38:48.516 --> 38:50.983
Could you hand me my thong?

38:50.985 --> 38:53.119
It dropped next
to your leg.

39:05.666 --> 39:07.566
Kate...

39:07.568 --> 39:09.135
Yeah?

39:09.137 --> 39:11.974
If you fell in love
with someone...

39:13.775 --> 39:16.077
madly in love
with someone...

39:18.780 --> 39:21.880
would that make life
worth living more?

39:21.882 --> 39:25.017
So, you're saying
if I met this man

39:25.019 --> 39:29.722
and fell deeply, madly,
passionately in love with him

39:29.724 --> 39:31.990
in the next week and a half,

39:31.992 --> 39:34.894
would I decide
not to kill myself?

39:34.896 --> 39:36.499
Yes.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.103
I'd take him with me.

39:44.338 --> 39:47.639
You coming here
has shaken me up a bit.

39:47.641 --> 39:50.075
But I am glad
you decided to stay

39:50.077 --> 39:52.612
instead of going behind my back

39:52.614 --> 39:55.315
and tracking down
my mother's killer.

39:57.851 --> 39:59.788
Me too.

40:00.889 --> 40:02.591
You again?

40:03.358 --> 40:04.791
I have a, uh...

40:04.793 --> 40:07.327
I have a few more
questions for you,

40:07.329 --> 40:08.961
if you're not
gonna mind.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.932
Hey, man,
why should I mind?

40:12.934 --> 40:15.004
All I got is time!
You want a taste?

40:16.371 --> 40:18.139
I do!

40:23.978 --> 40:27.847
- Oh, that's good!
- Mm-hmm.

40:27.849 --> 40:32.021
Um, I do have a few
questions about your family.

40:33.288 --> 40:35.220
Do they live
around here?

40:35.222 --> 40:38.324
Family. Let's see...
Oh, right, for your article.

40:38.326 --> 40:39.958
Yeah.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.330
Getting personal
now, are we?

40:44.065 --> 40:46.965
I haven't seen my
mother since I was 17,

40:46.967 --> 40:49.267
and, uh, I never
had the pleasure

40:49.269 --> 40:51.970
of being introduced
to the old man.

40:51.972 --> 40:53.940
I'm sorry
to hear that.

40:53.942 --> 40:55.340
Sorry? About what?

40:55.342 --> 40:57.744
That you never got
to know your father.

40:59.114 --> 41:00.849
I'm not!

41:03.784 --> 41:05.017
And your mother?

41:05.019 --> 41:06.956
Why... why haven't
you seen her?

41:08.155 --> 41:12.025
She used to do
the beauty-pageant circuit

41:12.027 --> 41:14.229
when she was
a teenager.

41:15.797 --> 41:18.898
She was a troubled
woman later in life,

41:18.900 --> 41:21.103
something wrong
in her brain.

41:22.070 --> 41:24.807
I feel sorry
for her, actually.

41:27.708 --> 41:28.874
Right.

41:32.179 --> 41:34.349
Do you have
any siblings?

41:35.315 --> 41:37.619
Nope.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.690
Do you talk to
Kate anymore?

41:43.925 --> 41:46.028
You've really
done your homework.

41:47.061 --> 41:49.795
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

41:49.797 --> 41:51.396
How come?

41:51.398 --> 41:53.868
You know how
these things are.

41:54.969 --> 41:56.269
Yeah.

41:57.938 --> 42:00.273
Well, um, don't
you miss her?

42:01.943 --> 42:06.749
Yeah, sometimes, when I'm
lying in bed late at night.

42:08.215 --> 42:12.286
She gave me the
best head I've ever had.

42:14.489 --> 42:17.126
You wouldn't
fucking believe it!

42:21.929 --> 42:23.132
Hey!

42:24.833 --> 42:26.833
How was your morning?

42:26.835 --> 42:30.503
- Oh, fine.
- Mmm.

42:30.505 --> 42:31.907
What are you up to?

42:33.041 --> 42:34.941
I'm gonna take a shower.

You have, um, really

thinking about right now?

Mm-hmm.

43:56.391 --> 43:57.990

43:57.992 --> 44:00.394

want to talk about?

44:13.007 --> 44:16.244
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

44:17.277 --> 44:19.345
Why did you stop?

44:19.347 --> 44:22.447
I'm just a little bit
nervous. That's all.

Don't worry so much.

44:37.297 --> 44:38.399
Oh...

44:39.367 --> 44:41.467
Are you serious?

44:41.469 --> 44:44.470
Hmm. How about I wash
your hair or something?

44:44.472 --> 44:47.373
How about you get
the fuck out of my shower?

44:47.375 --> 44:50.943
What?
What the fuck?

44:50.945 --> 44:53.081
Hey, no, wait!

44:54.181 --> 44:55.914
Wait! Can we talk?

44:55.916 --> 44:57.048
No!

44:57.050 --> 44:58.483
But I need to
talk to you.

44:58.485 --> 45:00.253
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

45:00.255 --> 45:02.220
Get out
of my house!

45:02.222 --> 45:06.360
- Please!
- Go! Get the fuck out!

45:08.528 --> 45:11.097
- Fine!
- Wait!

45:11.099 --> 45:14.236
- What?
- Drop the towel.

45:15.670 --> 45:18.574
- Are you serious?
- It's my favourite towel.

45:20.275 --> 45:22.407
You are one crazy...

45:58.713 --> 46:00.579
I'm not
letting you in.

46:00.581 --> 46:02.483
I don't want
to come in.

46:45.559 --> 46:48.461
I'm glad I didn't
go and see Henry.

46:48.463 --> 46:51.199
I think if I ever
met him, I...

46:52.367 --> 46:54.002
I would kill him.

47:00.273 --> 47:02.277
I'm gonna go change.

47:04.579 --> 47:07.345
I'll be here,

47:07.347 --> 47:12.385
waiting patiently
for you to return.

47:28.135 --> 47:30.972
<i>"Birds Do the Strangest Things."</i>

47:57.697 --> 48:00.469
Oh! Uh...

48:02.170 --> 48:03.436
Oh...

48:04.438 --> 48:05.804
Whoa!

48:05.806 --> 48:08.773
- Hey!
- Yeah, hey! Hey.

48:08.775 --> 48:10.275
I need a smoke.

48:10.277 --> 48:11.510
OK.

48:11.512 --> 48:13.179
Want me to
roll you one?

48:13.181 --> 48:15.349
Uh, sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:16.717 --> 48:18.516
Hey...

48:18.518 --> 48:19.717
Hmm?

48:19.719 --> 48:21.854
What's wrong
with you?

48:21.856 --> 48:24.557
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.

48:24.559 --> 48:25.825
Mmm...

48:25.827 --> 48:27.827
No, I'm just, um...

48:27.829 --> 48:30.862
I was just thinking about
that letter, you know.

48:30.864 --> 48:32.197
Mmm.

48:32.199 --> 48:34.666
Like, who the hell
could have written it?

48:34.668 --> 48:37.436
Do you have, um...
Do you have any idea?

48:37.438 --> 48:39.807
No. I have no idea.

48:41.242 --> 48:43.678
I mean, your guess
is as good as mine.

48:45.213 --> 48:49.384
Hey, I'm hungry!
Let's go get some food.

49:13.673 --> 49:15.740
- So, Kate...
- Hmm?

49:15.742 --> 49:17.709
Look, I need to
ask you something...

49:17.711 --> 49:20.748
Hey. I wrote the letter.

49:23.550 --> 49:25.483
You may never
want to see me again,

49:25.485 --> 49:26.885
and I'll understand that.

49:26.887 --> 49:29.220
So, what? This whole
thing's been a lie?

49:29.222 --> 49:31.356
Just let me explain, OK?

49:31.358 --> 49:33.626
Well, tell me!
Enlighten me into your psyche.

49:33.628 --> 49:35.394
- OK, I'm...
- The truth.

49:35.396 --> 49:37.463
- Yes, of course.
- No more lies.

49:37.465 --> 49:38.567
No more lies.

49:40.601 --> 49:42.267
I wrote you the letter

49:42.269 --> 49:44.769
because I wanted to
lure you over here

49:44.771 --> 49:47.940
and seduce you
into falling in love with me

49:47.942 --> 49:51.579
so I could convince you
to kill him, to kill Henry.

49:53.213 --> 49:55.748
What does that even mean?
What are you telling me?

49:55.750 --> 49:57.516
I thought that
if you fell for me

49:57.518 --> 49:59.552
and you knew that
he murdered my mother,

49:59.554 --> 50:01.322
you'd want to
help me get revenge.

50:02.489 --> 50:04.423
Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

50:04.425 --> 50:06.691
Well, now that I'm
the one falling for you,

50:06.693 --> 50:08.927
I can't go through
with it, so...

50:08.929 --> 50:10.528
You are? You're...

50:10.530 --> 50:13.601
Falling for you?
Completely.

50:17.572 --> 50:19.405
This doesn't make any sense.

50:19.407 --> 50:21.840
Why would you write me a letter
and lure me down here,

50:21.842 --> 50:24.677
but when I get down here,
you convince me not to see him?

50:24.679 --> 50:26.412
Henry's a very
convincing guy.

50:26.414 --> 50:28.546
I knew if you
met him, he would...

50:28.548 --> 50:30.682
You know, you
wouldn't believe me.

50:30.684 --> 50:32.284
Oh, I should
believe you now?

50:32.286 --> 50:33.651
Yes.

50:33.653 --> 50:35.253
OK, but why me?

50:35.255 --> 50:36.988
Why not get someone
else to kill him?

50:36.990 --> 50:39.557
- Motive.
- Why would I have a motive?

50:39.559 --> 50:41.961
Your recently deceased father
was having an affair

50:41.963 --> 50:43.394
and had a
secret family.

50:43.396 --> 50:45.396
You'd have motive
to want to kill the child

50:45.398 --> 50:46.567
that was a result
of that affair.

50:48.369 --> 50:49.934
I can't fucking believe
that you wanted me to kill him,

50:49.936 --> 50:51.470
or anyone
for that matter.

50:51.472 --> 50:53.005
That man fucking
killed my mother!

50:53.007 --> 50:55.673
- Yeah, I know. But...
- But what?

50:55.675 --> 50:58.276
It doesn't mean you have
the right to murder him.

50:58.278 --> 50:59.979
I mean, OK, he might
have deserved it.

50:59.981 --> 51:02.748
And if that was my mother,
I might want to do the same.

51:02.750 --> 51:04.316
So, what are
you saying?

51:04.318 --> 51:05.985
If you're so set
on killing yourself,

51:05.987 --> 51:07.552
why wouldn't you
just kill him?

51:07.554 --> 51:09.621
Believe me, that was
my first instinct,

51:09.623 --> 51:11.990
to just kill that
asshole myself.

51:11.992 --> 51:14.360
But, on the off chance
that I got caught,

51:14.362 --> 51:17.329
I wouldn't be able to execute
my suicide as planned.

51:17.331 --> 51:19.300
Oh, fuck!
You're insane.

51:22.369 --> 51:24.672
I just want what
he has coming to him.

51:26.507 --> 51:28.840
- I'm gonna go.
- Hey, don't go!

51:28.842 --> 51:31.744
Well, I'm going.
I need to figure shit out.

51:31.746 --> 51:34.847
Please, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to lie to you.

51:34.849 --> 51:36.481

52:50.590 --> 52:52.527
Mission accomplished.

52:54.661 --> 52:56.994
You look tired.

52:56.996 --> 53:00.099
Yeah. I couldn't sleep
at all last night.

53:00.101 --> 53:02.037
Me either.

53:04.739 --> 53:06.907
You should quit those,
you know.

53:14.014 --> 53:15.817
Let me have a drag.

53:26.025 --> 53:28.092
How do you think
I'd do in prison?

53:29.597 --> 53:31.599
What a defeatist
attitude.

53:33.067 --> 53:35.867
You don't think you
can get away with it?

53:38.505 --> 53:40.505
- Let's get out of here.
- OK.

53:40.507 --> 53:42.476
Should we get
something to eat?

53:43.510 --> 53:44.945
Definitely!

55:05.125 --> 55:07.191

55:07.193 --> 55:09.827
I woke up, and you
weren't next to me.

55:09.829 --> 55:11.729
I thought you'd left.

55:11.731 --> 55:14.101
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

55:19.773 --> 55:21.675

55:23.643 --> 55:25.110
Yeah.

55:25.112 --> 55:28.450

Wh-what's wrong?

55:31.684 --> 55:33.188
I don't know.

55:41.295 --> 55:44.097
Last night
was so much fun.

55:45.164 --> 55:47.231
Maybe we could do
something today.

55:47.233 --> 55:51.603
We could go somewhere
neither of us have been before.

55:53.873 --> 55:58.212
I... I don't want to
do anything today, OK?

56:01.648 --> 56:03.217
Are you upset with me?

56:09.856 --> 56:12.092
You can go if you want to.

56:14.061 --> 56:15.697
I get it.

59:05.231 --> 59:07.932
- What?
- I can't sleep.

59:07.934 --> 59:11.336
I need to talk to you

59:11.338 --> 59:12.970

I don't know.

OK.

59:29.389 --> 59:31.025
Hey...

59:34.460 --> 59:36.394
I was thinking
about what you said,

59:36.396 --> 59:38.362
about wanting me to kill Henry.

59:38.364 --> 59:40.434
What about it?

59:42.436 --> 59:44.135
I want to do it.

59:44.137 --> 59:45.440
What?

59:46.873 --> 59:48.940
Henry murdered
your mother.

59:48.942 --> 59:50.474
The guy
deserves it.

59:50.476 --> 59:53.478
He deserves to die,
and I want to do it.

59:53.480 --> 59:55.349
I want to
do it for you.

59:56.449 --> 59:58.516
Are you fucking with me?

59:58.518 --> 01:00:01.054
No, I'm
totally serious.

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.992
OK, well, why the change?

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:08.526
Don't you agree it's insane?

01:00:08.528 --> 01:00:11.396
I mean, you're a lot of things,
but you're not a killer.

01:00:11.398 --> 01:00:13.865
Yeah, you're right,
I'm not a killer,

01:00:13.867 --> 01:00:16.568
but I've also never felt
this way about anyone before.

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.103
People change.

01:00:18.105 --> 01:00:19.970
People do crazy things,

01:00:19.972 --> 01:00:22.342
things they never could
have imagined doing.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.313
This is what
you wanted, right?

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:31.115
It's what you
were planning.

01:00:31.117 --> 01:00:32.284
Yeah, but...

01:00:32.286 --> 01:00:34.885
Well, let's just
stick to the plan.

01:00:34.887 --> 01:00:36.454
It was a crazy plan.

01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:39.227
Well, I'm in
a crazy kind of mood.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.028
You're being ridiculous.

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:46.530
You don't think I'm capable
of going through with it.

01:00:46.532 --> 01:00:50.003
I'm not saying that.
I just don't know if...

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:52.436
You'll get caught.

01:00:52.438 --> 01:00:54.107
I've got this.

01:00:58.478 --> 01:01:01.079
So, how are you
gonna do it exactly?

01:01:01.081 --> 01:01:02.313
Shoot him.

01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:04.548
- Shoot him?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.085 --> 01:01:07.854
You know,
with a gun.

01:01:10.556 --> 01:01:13.191
Well, do you
even have a gun?

01:01:13.193 --> 01:01:15.329
No, I need to go buy one.

01:01:16.896 --> 01:01:19.597
OK, sure.
Go get a gun and shoot him.

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:23.101
Hey, I'm offering up
my services.

01:01:25.972 --> 01:01:27.905
I... You're crazy.

01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:31.976
Blah! I'm fucking crazy!

01:01:31.978 --> 01:01:34.211
I'm a fucking nutter!
And I'm gonna do it.

01:02:02.175 --> 01:02:04.508
Where did you get a gun?

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:07.211
From a shady gun dealer guy.

01:02:07.213 --> 01:02:09.916
He even threw in
some free bullets.

01:02:13.219 --> 01:02:14.653
Now I just need to figure out

01:02:14.655 --> 01:02:16.521
how to execute
the perfect murder.

01:02:16.523 --> 01:02:20.258
Sean, have you ever
even shot a gun?

01:02:21.427 --> 01:02:22.661
How hard could it be?

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:25.362
This guy said this is
really easy to handle.

01:02:25.364 --> 01:02:27.965
It's just a point and
a shoot type of deal.

01:02:27.967 --> 01:02:32.003
I thought about using a blade,
but that would be too messy.

01:02:32.005 --> 01:02:34.139
You're not serious?
This is crazy!

01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:38.079
No. I'm willing
to do anything for you.

01:02:42.315 --> 01:02:43.951
OK.

01:02:57.496 --> 01:02:59.000
You know...

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.298
I'm pretty impressed

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.971
you actually went out
and bought a gun.

01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:08.175
It's kind of bad-ass.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:13.380
Well, you're
bringing it out of me.

01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:17.014
So, what's the plan?

01:03:17.016 --> 01:03:19.684
Well, I've come up
with something

01:03:19.686 --> 01:03:22.220
totally elaborate and genius.

01:03:22.222 --> 01:03:23.688
Mm-hmm.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:26.027
I'm gonna follow him.

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:31.666
And then I'll corner him in
a hidden alley somewhere nearby.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.339
And then I'll shoot him
in the back of his fucking head.

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:43.144
What do you think?

01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:47.414
I think it'll work.

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:50.648
You got any bananas?

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.688
No. If you want fruit, go
to the fucking grocery store!

01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:56.588
Uh, two mangoes.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:59.490
Get out
of here. Go!

01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:01.728
Jesus Christ!

01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:13.641
Are you ready for this?

01:04:15.409 --> 01:04:17.608
Ready as
I'll ever be.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.313
You brought the gun?

01:04:20.347 --> 01:04:22.216
I've got it.

01:04:24.818 --> 01:04:26.383
What about
the gunshot?

01:04:26.385 --> 01:04:29.253
When the gun goes off,
people are gonna hear it.

01:04:29.255 --> 01:04:30.621
What if there
are witnesses?

01:04:30.623 --> 01:04:32.657
That's why you've
gotta be my lookout.

01:04:32.659 --> 01:04:35.526
Signal me if you see
someone loafing about,

01:04:35.528 --> 01:04:36.661
and I'll back away.

01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:38.599
Plus, it's late.
Look, nobody's around.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:44.135
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I don't.

01:04:44.137 --> 01:04:46.271
But if something weird happens,
I'll improvise.

01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:48.409
What about the body?

01:04:50.577 --> 01:04:52.142
What about it?

01:04:52.144 --> 01:04:54.545
What are gonna do with it
after you've killed him?

01:04:54.547 --> 01:04:56.414
Nothing. We're just
gonna leave him.

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:58.682
What?

01:04:58.684 --> 01:05:02.088
I don't think there's anything
wrong with leaving the body.

01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:07.093
Why are you
doing this?

01:05:08.228 --> 01:05:10.030
Why?

01:05:10.864 --> 01:05:12.666
You know why.

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:15.369
No, I don't.

01:05:16.335 --> 01:05:17.771
Not really.

01:05:20.239 --> 01:05:21.508
He's leaving.

01:05:22.476 --> 01:05:25.443
OK, this is it.

01:05:25.445 --> 01:05:26.680
Are you...

01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:38.322
Henry.

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:45.729
Stop! Stop.

01:05:45.731 --> 01:05:47.231
What... what
are you doing?

01:05:47.233 --> 01:05:48.599
I can't let
you do this!

01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:50.501
- Kate?
- Hey.

01:05:50.503 --> 01:05:53.470
Look, I lied to you
about everything, OK?

01:05:53.472 --> 01:05:55.340
He's not your
half-brother.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.740
What?

01:05:56.742 --> 01:05:58.610
You told him I'm
his half-brother?

01:05:58.612 --> 01:05:59.776
- Yes.
- Hey, fuck this!

01:05:59.778 --> 01:06:01.347
No, don't touch me!

01:06:02.916 --> 01:06:05.383
He's just this guy
I used to date.

01:06:05.385 --> 01:06:07.217
Henry's your
ex-boyfriend?

01:06:07.219 --> 01:06:08.288
Yes.

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:13.191
But the murder trial.
This guy killed your mother.

01:06:13.193 --> 01:06:15.726
Well, he really was
on trial for killing a woman.

01:06:15.728 --> 01:06:17.795
It... it just wasn't my mother.

01:06:17.797 --> 01:06:20.365
You told this guy
I killed your mother?

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:21.798
Yes, OK? Sorry!

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.235
This is so fucked up.
Why do you have a gun?

01:06:24.237 --> 01:06:26.604
- He was gonna kill you!
- What?

01:06:26.606 --> 01:06:28.509
I wasn't really
gonna do it.

01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:32.242
I knew that you
were lying to me.

01:06:32.244 --> 01:06:33.279
I was just
calling your bluff.

01:06:35.215 --> 01:06:37.749
I even did the research
on this guy, on the trial.

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:39.650
Your parents
aren't even dead.

01:06:39.652 --> 01:06:41.219
I found the speech
that I wrote

01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:42.920
for my father's funeral
in your house.

01:06:42.922 --> 01:06:44.889
You've been lying
to me this entire time!

01:06:44.891 --> 01:06:46.925
And could everyone
just calm the fuck down!

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:48.659
This thing isn't
even loaded. Look.

01:06:50.697 --> 01:06:52.262
That wasn't
meant to happen.

01:06:52.264 --> 01:06:54.532
There might have been
something in the chamber.

01:06:54.534 --> 01:06:56.700
There's... This was
a mistake. I swear.

01:06:56.702 --> 01:06:59.269
You guys are
both psychotic.

01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:00.938
I should
call the cops.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.807
No! No, no, no.
Don't do that.

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:05.409
He's right. There's
no need to call the cops.

01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:07.545
This is just a big
misunderstanding.

01:07:07.547 --> 01:07:09.680
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

01:07:09.682 --> 01:07:11.282
Let's go, Kate.

01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:12.684
I'm not
coming with you!

01:07:12.686 --> 01:07:13.653
Fine!

01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:16.688
I've gotta go.

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.655
Sean. Wait!

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:22.930
I guess I'll see you
on the other side.

01:07:24.797 --> 01:07:26.731
Oh, what?
The whole suicide thing?

01:07:26.733 --> 01:07:28.432
I don't know a lot
about anything,

01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:30.436
but I know you're not
gonna kill yourself.

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.604
You came to my father's
funeral, though.

01:07:33.606 --> 01:07:34.972
That was real.

01:07:34.974 --> 01:07:37.307
I'm still trying
to figure out

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:40.311
what kind of a sick
person would do that,

01:07:40.313 --> 01:07:43.847
to screw with someone
in their weakest moment.

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:47.253
A really, really
fucked-up person.

01:07:48.655 --> 01:07:52.593
You're an original.
I'll give you that much.

01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:58.265
No! No, I take that back.

01:07:59.032 --> 01:08:01.335
You're a fucking cliché!

01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:26.894
<i>My whole life is a lie.</i>

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.868
<i>Falling for you?</i>

01:08:37.002 --> 01:08:38.770
<i>Completely.</i>

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.676
Kate?

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.354
Kate?

01:10:47.065 --> 01:10:49.502
Kate?

01:11:05.685 --> 01:11:08.856
Uh, hi.
It's me. Um...

01:11:10.457 --> 01:11:12.790
Uh, I'm... I'm...
I'm at the house.

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:15.759
Could you call me
when you get this, please?

01:11:15.761 --> 01:11:19.465
Uh, thanks. OK. Bye.

01:11:32.645 --> 01:11:35.245
Hey! Can I help you?

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:37.915
Oh, I'm... I'm just looking
for my friend Kate.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.420
She lives up
in this house.

01:11:44.056 --> 01:11:46.760
Sir, no one named Kate
lives in that house.

01:11:48.161 --> 01:11:49.927
What do you mean?

01:11:49.929 --> 01:11:51.928
The house is on the market.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.900
No one's lived there
for the last 4 months.

01:11:56.869 --> 01:12:00.537
N-no, it isn't.
What are you talking about?

01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:02.607
I was here recently.
You've seen me here.

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:04.709
I've never seen you
in my life.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.210
Yes, you have.

01:12:06.212 --> 01:12:09.112
You waved to me once when you
were throwing your trash out.

01:12:09.114 --> 01:12:10.947
I don't know
what to tell you, pal.

01:12:10.949 --> 01:12:12.051
But you got
the wrong guy.

01:12:13.152 --> 01:12:16.056
I gotta get to work.
Take it easy!

01:12:26.198 --> 01:12:27.533
You're here!

01:12:29.167 --> 01:12:31.471
Hi!

01:12:33.171 --> 01:12:35.475
Hey.

01:12:36.943 --> 01:12:38.679
You came back.

01:12:43.082 --> 01:12:44.952
Just in time.

01:12:46.118 --> 01:12:47.884
You moved out?

01:12:47.886 --> 01:12:51.155
Yeah. Packed up all my junk
and I'm headed out of here.

01:12:51.157 --> 01:12:53.624
I just had a run-in
with your neighbour.

01:12:53.626 --> 01:12:55.192
He told me he
didn't know you,

01:12:55.194 --> 01:12:57.294
and nobody's lived
here for months.

01:12:57.296 --> 01:12:59.930
I paid him a few bucks
to put you on.

01:12:59.932 --> 01:13:01.632
You kidding me?

01:13:01.634 --> 01:13:03.668
Would you expect
anything less?

01:13:04.904 --> 01:13:06.670
You're certifiable.

01:13:06.672 --> 01:13:09.976
You are for
coming back here.

01:13:16.349 --> 01:13:19.920
You told me one day
that you were falling for me.

01:13:21.253 --> 01:13:23.256
Was that real?

01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:36.270
No.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:41.140
I was totally in love
with you at that point.

01:13:43.876 --> 01:13:46.079
How can I
believe you?

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.916
You can't.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.889
Kate, are you happy?

01:13:59.993 --> 01:14:02.296
I've been
happiest with you...

01:14:03.261 --> 01:14:05.097
even when I'm sad.

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.968
I went to that beach.
I told my father about you.

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.803
What did he say?

01:14:12.805 --> 01:14:14.641
He likes you.

01:14:17.909 --> 01:14:21.782
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.384
I still don't,
um, understand.

01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:31.121
Why were you at
the beach that day?

01:14:31.123 --> 01:14:33.124
Why did you
write that letter

01:14:33.126 --> 01:14:35.662
and leave it on
my car windshield?

01:14:37.296 --> 01:14:39.733
I guess it doesn't
matter why.

01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:46.137
I was there at the
beach, taking a walk,

01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:49.106
and I stopped to watch
some of the ceremony.

01:14:49.108 --> 01:14:52.712
I saw you and thought
you were handsome.

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:56.817
I wanted to
talk to you.

01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:00.985
Are you serious?

01:15:00.987 --> 01:15:03.387
You couldn't have just
introduced yourself?

01:15:04.724 --> 01:15:06.924
Is it strange that
never occurred to me?

01:15:08.293 --> 01:15:11.394
Strange? Oh, strange
is one way of putting it.

01:15:11.396 --> 01:15:12.862
You really had
me believe

01:15:12.864 --> 01:15:14.898
you had a death wish
there for a minute.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.867
And when I came back to your
apartment and it's empty,

01:15:17.869 --> 01:15:19.903
I'm expecting to see
yellow police tape

01:15:19.905 --> 01:15:21.772
and a chalk outline
of your body.

01:15:21.774 --> 01:15:23.773
That wasn't my intention.

01:15:23.775 --> 01:15:26.943
I was hoping you would
think I never existed.

01:15:26.945 --> 01:15:29.412
I was a figment of
your imagination

01:15:29.414 --> 01:15:32.482
brought on by some
kind of psychotic break.

01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:36.786
And everything you'd ever known
about this life was wrong.

01:15:36.788 --> 01:15:39.259
That was my
very next thought.

01:15:41.127 --> 01:15:43.864
Why do I
like you so much?

01:15:46.899 --> 01:15:51.201
Being with you
has been amazing

01:15:51.203 --> 01:15:53.139
and chaotic...

01:15:54.106 --> 01:15:55.940
random.

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:58.808
Being without you,
I felt like I've died,

01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:01.445
like a vampire comes
into my room at night

01:16:01.447 --> 01:16:04.083
and drains all the blood
out of my body.
