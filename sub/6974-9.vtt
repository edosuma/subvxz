00:27.193 --> 00:30.629
Sector Station to Unit One.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.858
Unit One, please report.

00:32.932 --> 00:37.198
Unit One reporting.
No traffic or unusual activity.

00:37.270 --> 00:43.140
Tell her my ass is freezing off and l need
somebody here to get the blood circulating.

00:43.209 --> 00:48.374
Sector Station, Agent Daley
has a very special request.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.384
The mic's off.

00:51.451 --> 00:56.047
- Don't scare me like that.
- Keeps you awake, don't it?

01:01.594 --> 01:04.256
- Something moving.
- Where?

01:04.330 --> 01:08.198
Heading right through the trees.
Straight ahead.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.566
You see it?

01:15.775 --> 01:17.970
Got it.

01:28.922 --> 01:34.792
Unit One to Sector Station. We are
in pursuit of an illegal border crossing.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.173
The rabbit's running for the hole.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.865
End of the road, buddy.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.475
Agent Scully. He's expecting me.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.983
Go right in. They're all waiting for you.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.884
''They?''

04:30.503 --> 04:36.601
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Have a seat, please.

04:36.676 --> 04:40.806
- May l ask what this is about?
- You can take a seat, please.

04:57.664 --> 05:03.432
Deputy Director Kersh has called you
here today to ask you a few questions.

05:03.503 --> 05:07.803
All right? Just a few routine questions.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.474
Do you know what this is?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.141
Should l?

05:22.955 --> 05:26.982
lt's a simple question, Agent Scully.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.994
Do you know what this is?

05:41.908 --> 05:44.240
- l'm not sure.
- But you've seen it before?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.472
Am l under suspicion here?

05:47.547 --> 05:53.349
Assistant Director Skinner led us to believe
that you'd be able to identify this evidence.

05:53.419 --> 05:57.150
- Why is that?
- You once worked on the X-Files.

05:57.223 --> 06:00.852
Then why don't you ask somebody
who's working on the X-Files?

06:00.927 --> 06:03.657
Because we're asking you.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.093
Where did you get these?

06:08.201 --> 06:16.108
They were found during an illegal border
crossing in North Dakota. Canada to the US.

06:16.209 --> 06:23.445
- An illegal border crossing by whom?
- We're asking the questions here today.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.779
What AD Follmer is saying is,

06:25.885 --> 06:32.290
your cooperation is important
to this investigation, Agent Scully.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.762
l'd like to cooperate.
l'd be happy to cooperate.

06:39.565 --> 06:45.595
l just wish that you would tell me
who or what you are investigating.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.605
Were you called about this?

06:58.651 --> 07:01.552
- Has AD Follmer been down here?
- Brad Follmer?

07:01.621 --> 07:04.454
Yeah. Going through the X-Files.

07:05.158 --> 07:10.755
l doubt Agent Follmer even knows
who we are down here, Agent Scully.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.557
Why? What are you looking for?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.302
These.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.241
- What are they?
- Rubbings.

07:27.313 --> 07:31.113
- Taken from the surface structure of a craft.
- A craft?

07:31.184 --> 07:37.145
A spacecraft, Agent Doggett,
if you can wrap your brain around that.

07:37.256 --> 07:40.487
They were found by fishermen
off the western coast of Africa.

07:40.593 --> 07:44.495
Two years ago, l traveled there to study it,
and l took these.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.428
What has this to do with Follmer?

07:46.499 --> 07:51.835
l was called into the deputy director's office
and shown an exact copy of that rubbing.

07:51.938 --> 07:55.203
l was asked by senior staff
to identify it for them.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.937
- Where did they get them?
- A guy running the border from Canada.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.536
Or so they say.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.639
What did you tell them about these?

08:04.717 --> 08:06.514
Nothing.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.617
And what aren't you telling us?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.293
That they're powerful.

08:15.361 --> 08:18.888
We're talking about
pieces of paper with marks on.

08:18.998 --> 08:23.162
They're notjust marks, Agent Doggett.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.227
lt's writing.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.136
Words.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.835
Powerful words.

08:31.644 --> 08:37.707
And if the FBl has them, and they're keeping
their investigation of them a secret,

08:37.817 --> 08:41.650
then they have a sense of their power as well.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.902
Special Agent John Doggett,
out of Washington.

09:06.012 --> 09:09.778
Looking for the agent in charge out here.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.410
Anybody point me to the ASAC?

09:35.775 --> 09:38.403
Agent Doggett.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.206
Assistant Director.

09:40.279 --> 09:44.443
l don't recall asking for your help
or assistance on this case.

09:44.550 --> 09:49.146
The way it looks, l'm the only agent
outside DC you didn't ask.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.951
What's the big attraction?

09:53.626 --> 09:57.653
Last night, a man made
an illegal border crossing from Canada.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.561
A chase ensued. Ended here.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.898
Do you know anything about him?
About what he was doing?

10:03.970 --> 10:07.963
We're endeavoring
to learn as much as we can.

10:08.074 --> 10:13.273
- Was he carrying anything interesting?
- Like what?

10:14.814 --> 10:20.252
l don't know. Like maybe
something you'd find in an X-File.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.023
lf that's what you came looking for,
then you came a long way for nothing.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.027
- Then what's with the cavalry?
- Excuse me?

10:30.129 --> 10:35.260
A lot of good shoes out here
looking for what's gotta be a dead man.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.996
The guy was killed, right?

10:38.104 --> 10:41.096
A man survives a fall like this, on fire?

10:41.173 --> 10:43.869
lt's not very likely.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.240
You got a body?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.213
We will, Agent Doggett.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.444
Like you say, l got the cavalry out here.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.712
You find that funny?

10:56.822 --> 11:00.952
A dead man up and disappearing?
Happens every day, right?

11:01.027 --> 11:03.791
At least it does on the X-Files.

11:04.563 --> 11:10.058
Trust me, Mr Doggett,
this has nothing to do with you.

11:10.169 --> 11:14.629
Nothing to do with you, or the X-Files.

11:16.709 --> 11:22.477
Stick your nose in this case,
and l promise you, you'll live to regret it.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.216
Hi. Thanks for coming.

12:34.787 --> 12:39.781
- l needed to talk to you about this in person.
- What is it?

12:42.728 --> 12:46.494
What l'm reading in your field report
on these rubbings.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.568
There's something l didn't understand.

12:49.635 --> 12:53.469
You say these were taken off a spacecraft.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.941
You determined they were words, writings.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.945
You didn't tell us you knew what they said.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.974
What little l read was
through the help of an interpreter.

13:07.086 --> 13:12.752
But you interpreted them as text
from the Bible, from the Koran...

13:13.793 --> 13:17.126
Scripture from religions around the world.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.029
And science, too.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.499
The periodic table of elements.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.593
Yes.

13:26.872 --> 13:31.832
And you wrote in your report
they were millions of years old.

13:31.944 --> 13:37.814
Based on radiometric readings from fossils
encrusted on the surface of the ship.

13:39.685 --> 13:46.352
Agent Scully, l know you've become
more open-minded about these things,

13:46.458 --> 13:49.791
but do you know what it is
you're saying here?

13:52.531 --> 13:58.800
lf it were true,
these symbols wouldn'tjust be words.

14:00.039 --> 14:06.467
They'd be the very word of God
on the surface of an alien spacecraft.

14:07.179 --> 14:15.416
lt'd mean that everything
mankind believes in... is in question.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.589
And you believe this?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.683
l didn't.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.662
l refused to believe it.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.364
But now l think...

14:31.170 --> 14:34.765
l think there may be answers there.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.741
Answers to what?

14:37.843 --> 14:40.710
Answers about my son.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.216
l know how that sounds.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.250
l have no one else to say it to.

14:53.759 --> 14:58.059
That l was meant to find these.

14:58.964 --> 15:04.061
Somehow these were meant for me.

15:04.770 --> 15:09.867
Why would the FBl keep that from you?
From us?

15:09.942 --> 15:13.207
And what exactly do they want with them?

15:16.048 --> 15:19.745
Those are questions l can't answer.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.101
Forget our extension?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.429
Or you just can't be bothered?

15:42.308 --> 15:45.505
- Excuse me?
- Returning calls.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.741
Agent Reyes's, mine.
What the hell's that about?

15:49.815 --> 15:53.581
l've been tied up.
l just haven't had a chance.

15:53.652 --> 15:59.420
That's not what your phone log says. lt says
you've returned everyone's calls but ours.

15:59.491 --> 16:03.086
Let me remind you
who answers to whom here.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.858
l think you owe me an answer, sir.

16:05.965 --> 16:12.336
And if you don't owe it to me, you owe it to
Agent Scully, on this X-File case the FBl's got.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.305
The one they're keeping us
from investigating.

16:15.374 --> 16:20.471
Are you ready for my answer?
lt's not an X-File case.

16:20.546 --> 16:26.815
That's why you have 40 agents combing
the border for a dead man that ain't dead.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.448
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- l was there.

16:31.523 --> 16:34.458
Without any authorizations.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.391
l don't understand.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.159
None of us do.

16:41.233 --> 16:45.829
Why you're keeping their secrets.
Why you're keeping quiet.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.807
Because l know things you don't.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.906
And it's for your own good.

19:18.357 --> 19:23.351
- Yeah? Who's there?
- lt's me. Open up, Monica.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.833
- Got it.
- Got what?

19:28.901 --> 19:32.462
What they've been keeping a secret.
What they won't tell Scully.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.132
What they wouldn't tell us.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.236
What am l looking at?

19:40.345 --> 19:45.647
A file on the guy crossing
the Canadian border last night.

19:45.717 --> 19:49.016
- Special Agent Robert Comer.
- He's FBl.

19:49.087 --> 19:53.183
l know this guy. l worked a case with him
in New Orleans. Straight as a ruler.

19:53.258 --> 19:58.025
- Last six months he's been deep undercover.
- Undercover doing what?

19:58.096 --> 20:03.329
We got a pile of reading to do -
what's not blacked out. And...

20:04.536 --> 20:07.437
l picked these up in a bargain.

20:08.707 --> 20:13.167
- AD Skinner gave you these?
- l sort of got it on loan.

20:14.279 --> 20:18.375
- We'd better call Agent Scully.
- l already did.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.724
You need a hand there, bro?

21:06.798 --> 21:08.993
How about l just help you out?

21:37.529 --> 21:39.429
l'm on my way.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.298
That was Agent Doggett again.
They're waiting. Mom, l gotta go.

21:43.368 --> 21:46.633
l don't understand why
it can't wait till tomorrow.

21:46.705 --> 21:51.540
- lt's important. l wouldn't go if it weren't.
- You say it's about getting answers.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.339
Answers about William, Mom.

21:54.446 --> 21:59.008
l know you're worried about him,
but there are things you just can't explain.

21:59.117 --> 22:03.178
- lf you got answers, what would it change?
- He's my child.

22:03.288 --> 22:07.987
And you have to love him and raise him,
in spite of everything.

22:08.060 --> 22:15.125
Dana, God has given you a miracle,
a child that wasn't supposed to be.

22:15.901 --> 22:21.134
Maybe it's not to question,
just to be taken as a matter of faith.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.975
l can't take this on faith.

22:26.044 --> 22:28.342
l need to know.

22:31.083 --> 22:35.076
l need to know
if it's really God l have to thank.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.949
- Where'd you get those?
- l got 'em.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.357
And the FBl's file
on the man who was carrying 'em.

23:16.428 --> 23:19.022
He's one of ours, working deep undercover,

23:19.097 --> 23:23.295
infiltrating a religious group,
some whacked out UFO cult.

23:23.368 --> 23:27.464
- A case they never told us about.
- Where's this cult supposed to be?

23:27.539 --> 23:30.997
North Dakota. At some point
they disappear into Canada.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.273
Agent goes along with them,
FBl loses contact with him.

23:34.346 --> 23:38.476
What did they think he was doing, running
across the border with these rubbings?

23:38.550 --> 23:42.748
The FBl thinks he went on to the dark side,
became whacked out himself.

23:42.821 --> 23:45.984
And that's the secret
they've been trying to keep.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.787
That's it? That's the big secret?

23:49.795 --> 23:54.630
That, and they can't seem to find him,
best l can figure.

23:57.769 --> 24:02.968
l was questioned this morning
by the senior staff of the FBl,

24:03.074 --> 24:06.942
not about an FBl agent
but about these rubbings.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.412
There's gotta be something more.

24:09.481 --> 24:14.919
There may be, Agent Scully.
But l'm not sure even the FBl is aware of it.

24:14.986 --> 24:18.979
How could they be,
without access to your files?

24:19.090 --> 24:22.958
- What are you talking about?
- The set of rubbings the man smuggled

24:23.028 --> 24:26.327
doesn't match the rubbings you took.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.359
Wait a second.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.433
How can that be?

24:33.505 --> 24:38.875
lt could only be that this whacked UFO cult
found a second spacecraft.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.570
Mom?

25:52.350 --> 25:55.251
He wants to kill the baby.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.538
Don't. Please!

26:15.607 --> 26:17.700
Don't.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.882
l'll kill you!
l'll kill you if you touch my baby!

26:31.957 --> 26:34.084
Dana.

27:08.493 --> 27:10.120
Oh, my God.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.095
Mrs Scully, are you OK?

27:19.537 --> 27:23.803
- What the hell happened here?
- l need your help.

27:25.343 --> 27:30.508
Agent Reyes, l need you to take
my mom and the baby. Can you do that?

27:31.683 --> 27:34.151
Of course.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.800
Who is that? ls somebody here?

28:10.989 --> 28:14.481
You gotta tell me what this is,
who the hell this is.

28:14.559 --> 28:20.088
That man, that FBl agent,
came here to kill my baby.

28:20.198 --> 28:24.362
- You gotta help this man.
- No. Not until he tells me why.

28:24.436 --> 28:29.430
He won't tell anybody anything unless you
get him to a hospital. He's losing blood fast.

28:29.541 --> 28:34.945
l am not gonna turn him over to the FBl. l am
not gonna let them cover their tracks on this.

28:35.046 --> 28:39.005
Why? Why do you want to hurt my son?

28:40.585 --> 28:43.713
Agent Doggett, put down the phone.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.518
He has to answer me.

28:46.591 --> 28:49.424
- He has...
- What? Say it.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.261
- Your son...
- Say it.

28:53.364 --> 28:56.424
- has to die.
- Why?

28:56.534 --> 28:59.731
Who told you that?

29:00.472 --> 29:02.736
He's my son.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.738
He's my son.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.904
l've got a medical emergency,
a man in critical...

29:20.558 --> 29:23.459
This man have any kind of a weapon?

29:25.463 --> 29:27.556
A pillow.

29:30.068 --> 29:35.062
Whatever brought him here,
l hope to God we figure it out.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.024
What is it?

31:43.468 --> 31:47.871
- This changes everything.
- He can expose all this.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.874
He's got proof he can show them.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.401
What do you wanna do?

31:58.316 --> 32:00.910
There's only one thing to do.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.893
Agent Scully, Agent Doggett.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.911
You can both have a seat.

32:35.987 --> 32:41.482
lf this is just gonna be
another interrogation, l'd prefer to stand.

32:43.127 --> 32:47.757
Agent Scully, a man was shot
in your apartment. An FBl agent.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.459
Trying to kill my son.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.594
That is not in question.
There'll be an investigation.

32:52.670 --> 32:57.698
Another secret investigation, or one where
l'm given warning that my family's in danger?

32:57.809 --> 33:03.372
lt would help us to help you if you tell us
anything this man communicated to you.

33:03.481 --> 33:08.145
l wouldn't tell 'em anything until they explain
why all the hush-hush over this case,

33:08.219 --> 33:12.212
why the doublespeak,
the mincing words from Mr Follmer.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.451
Cos l want answers myself.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.463
The man you shot had been undercover,

33:19.530 --> 33:23.990
which you've already found out
through whatever unethical means.

33:24.068 --> 33:30.337
His assignment was to infiltrate a religious
cult, one led by a former military officer,

33:30.408 --> 33:33.900
a very dangerous man by all accounts,

33:34.012 --> 33:39.814
and who also believed in
very dangerous ideas about aliens.

33:41.252 --> 33:47.350
Why wasn't l told? Why not Agent Doggett,
or Agent Reyes? Why wasn't this an X-File?

33:47.425 --> 33:52.522
l asked them to put somebody else on the
case because l was afraid it might break you.

33:55.933 --> 33:58.367
What are you talking about?

34:00.838 --> 34:07.539
Agent Comer, our undercover man,
was sent to infiltrate the cult

34:08.579 --> 34:12.413
based on a series of threats.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.784
Threats to who? To me? My child?

34:15.887 --> 34:20.551
Threats... on Agent Mulder's life.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.393
That's what this is about?

34:30.234 --> 34:35.194
Then why pull me in here
and show me those rubbings?

34:35.273 --> 34:37.366
l don't understand.

34:39.710 --> 34:46.411
Before losing all contact with our undercover
agent, he sent us a communication,

34:47.251 --> 34:50.708
a communication
we've been trying to confirm,

34:50.788 --> 34:52.380
that...

34:54.257 --> 34:57.887
that Mulder was already dead.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.619
- Here's your mommy.
- Hi, honey.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.763
Dana, what's wrong?

35:48.212 --> 35:50.305
What's happened?

35:55.486 --> 35:59.354
lt's OK. Just tell me what it is.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.830
lt's Mulder.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.748
What is it?

36:26.851 --> 36:29.319
An artifact.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.413
l got it from the man
who was trying to kill William.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.424
OK. But what the hell is it?

36:35.526 --> 36:39.189
lt's a piece of the spacecraft.

37:34.785 --> 37:37.481
- Where's Agent Scully?
- Still upstairs.

37:37.588 --> 37:41.547
l wanna talk to you before you see her,
to explain what's happened.

37:41.626 --> 37:45.221
You said it had something to do
with the kid, that piece of metal.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.491
A piece of that ship in Canada.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.500
Come on. You're just guessing
there's any such thing.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.265
lt flew through the air at the baby. l saw it.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.511
- Just tell me the boy's OK.
- l don't think you understand.

38:01.612 --> 38:05.275
The boy has some connection
with this thing, this piece of metal.

38:05.349 --> 38:07.317
You saying this kid's an alien?

38:07.418 --> 38:12.151
You can believe or not, but the man who
tried to kill Scully's baby believed it.

38:12.256 --> 38:19.321
So must this cult, who are obviously more
than willing to kill for their belief.

38:30.041 --> 38:34.000
- Where are we going?
- l'll tell you on the way.

38:59.503 --> 39:02.404
- You drive.
- What is it?

39:07.745 --> 39:11.181
- l'm right behind you guys.
- What is it?

39:11.248 --> 39:13.682
Probably nothing.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.978
Federal agent. Stop the car!

40:02.266 --> 40:07.101
- Who are we meeting?
- The only ones left we can trust.

40:24.955 --> 40:27.048
Hey, little man.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.332
Your baby's in good hands.

40:50.581 --> 40:54.915
l need to know that you're
taking him to a safe place.

40:54.985 --> 40:58.682
l need to know that
you're taking every precaution.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.417
We understand. Langly?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.486
There's a chance that
my phone lines have been tapped.

41:05.596 --> 41:09.259
- lf so, they can trace you.
- We thought about that.

41:09.333 --> 41:14.669
Six cellphones, their signals scrambled.
Use each one once and then throw it away.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.028
Whatever you do, don't worry.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.888
- What's going on here?
- l don't know.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.200
What happened?

42:23.507 --> 42:26.237
ls it John?

42:36.186 --> 42:39.053
Agent Scully.

42:39.123 --> 42:43.355
My baby. They're after my baby.
l have to get back.

42:53.437 --> 42:57.100
- What the hell is this?
- What the hell is what?

43:44.755 --> 43:47.349
