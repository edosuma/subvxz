Looks like he was stabbed in the chest.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.524
Got a bloody knife on the grill.
No sign of a forced entry.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.900
There’s still money in the register.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.529
He’s got a watch on his wrist,
hearing aid in his ear.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.365
-How’d the job come in?
-The son, Alex Stratis.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.867
He found him when he came in to work.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.285
-That’s him?
-Yeah.

-5:30.

-JOHN: Your dad usually here before that?
-Most mornings by 4:00.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.390
Once in a blue moon,
he’d decide to sleep in,

00:57.557 --> 00:58.683
roll in around 5:00.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.894
Can you think of anybody
who might had it in for him?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.104
Anybody get let go recently?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.774
About a month ago
he got rid of a guy. But,

01:06.191 --> 01:07.901
I don’t think he’d be the type to do this.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.195
We’ll need a list of all your employees.

01:11.362 --> 01:16.117
-ANDY: Your mom still around?
-Yeah. She and my dad split up years ago.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.663
She wanted to travel, see a movie.
All he did was work.

01:20.955 --> 01:24.334
He gave her the house in Astoria.
Took care of all the bills.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.128
Got himself a little apartment,
close to the restaurant.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.339
-He gamble?
-No, never.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.633
You know of anybody
that he borrowed money from?

01:31.716 --> 01:32.717
Not a soul.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.429
My father came to this country,
he didn’t know three words of English.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.808
Managed to buy a coffee shop, a house,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.060
a new car every two years,
on what he earned.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.771
On 50,000 orders of bacon and eggs.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.150
Hundred thousand hamburgers.
He bought my mother a mink coat.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.487
Sent my sister to private school,
put her through four years of college.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.823
I could’ve gone, too, if I wanted.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.533
Why didn’t you?

Paula? What happened? She get an A-minus?

04:03.701 --> 04:06.246
-You haven’t seen her in a while.
-Not that long.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.917
She got herself involved with a guy.
He’s 15 years older than her.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.710
He’s changed her.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.297
-How has he changed her?
-She dresses different.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.217
She talks to me different.
She stays out late.

-She’s 19.
-I smelled liquor on her breath

04:21.970 --> 04:23.137

04:23.554 --> 04:25.473
And I found, pills in her bag.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.477
I took two to see what they were.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.607
Well, these could be anything.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.944
-How many did she have?
-Ten or twelve.

04:39.028 --> 04:43.449
Oh, she’s always been such a good girl.
I prayed that this wouldn’t happen.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.828
-I don’t know what to do.
-You want me to talk to her?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.247
(SIGHS) She doesn’t listen to me.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.582
I’ll come by the apartment after work.

If you go by the store where she works,

04:54.919 --> 04:58.464
-you can meet him, too. It’s his store.
-Where is it?

04:59.590 --> 05:02.635

uh, Lafayette Street.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.490
I already got a call
from the captain downstairs.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.868

was popular with the guys on patrol.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.286
We’ll keep you posted.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.381
Wallet’s missing, watch is missing,
pockets turned inside out.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.258
Whatever cash he had on him is gone.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.719
Any I.D. in the vehicle?

05:44.886 --> 05:48.473

Paul Westerville, address in Armonk.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.891
Anybody hear anything?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.226
None of the attendants on duty
heard anything.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.771
From what they say,
this place is pretty deserted at night.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.190
Which might be why the body
wasn’t found until this morning.

-Good.

-Now let’s go talk in room 24.

-So, did you get second grade yet?
-No, not yet.

Nah. Always keeping the black man down.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.913

06:57.959 --> 07:01.379
Yeah, he was, uh, shot and killed
in a parking garage.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.173
-That’s unbelievable.
-What’s your connection to him?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.593
He’s a partner in the public relations
firm at the P.B.A. contract.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.887
When they decided to use me in the ads,
we got to know him.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.973
-How well?
-Pretty well.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.099
He... he’s a nice guy.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.560
Yeah... actually, we got to be kind
of friends. You know,

07:15.643 --> 07:18.771
me and Sheila had dinner with him
a bunch of times, been out to his house.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.108
-The last time you were with him was when?
-Yesterday afternoon.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.278
They had me come into this photographer’s
studio ’cause they’re doing new ads.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.865

a couple of hours taking pictures,

07:28.948 --> 07:30.533

07:31.033 --> 07:32.618
Paul was there for a while,
and then he left.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.036
Did he say where he was going?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.788
Yeah, I think he was going
back to his office.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.707
Why, did he got a call about
meeting somebody?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.250
Not that I was aware of.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.962
You... you get any hit off this guy
that’d make you think it was anything

07:43.045 --> 07:45.840
-other than a straight-up robbery?
-No, I didn’t.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.636
-All right. Thanks again for coming in.
-No problem.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.847

Smoking a joint, for starters.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.190
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.983
Yeah making me run,
that doesn’t help either.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.527
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.207
There’s so much to do getting
this stuff ready for storage.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.501
You have to pack up all his things?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.504
His personal things,
once his estate is probated,

09:06.587 --> 09:08.923
I’m expecting various characters
to come out of the woodwork

09:09.006 --> 09:10.299
claiming to be his children.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.427
-Why’s that?
-The way he conducted himself.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.055
Are you aware of anyone
who might have had a grudge against him?

09:16.347 --> 09:17.390

Public relations can be a nasty business.

Paul Westerville didn’t have a lot of
consideration for other people’s feelings.

You must have borne the brunt of that.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.234

09:29.569 --> 09:32.530
When I first started working for him
and I got the treatment,

09:33.239 --> 09:34.824
I’d run out of the office crying.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.244
I’d vow I’d never work for anyone
that abusive again.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.080
He’d apologize, give me a raise,

09:41.205 --> 09:43.708
and after a while,
it got so he needed me.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.629
I organized his life, I put up with him,
and he learned.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.966
Yell at everyone else.
Me, you don’t yell at.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.387
Are you aware of any current romantic
relationships

09:56.512 --> 09:58.139
Mr. Westerville was involved in?

09:58.222 --> 10:01.100
There was very little in Mr. Westerville’s
life that I wasn’t aware of.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.353
Anything come to mind that might have
created problems for him?

10:05.062 --> 10:08.107
Sleeping with someone else’s wife
has been known to create problems.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.567
Who are we talking about?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.028
The wife of this young police officer
who was paralyzed.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.529
And it made me sick.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.365

10:17.241 --> 10:19.368
-The officer’s father knew.
-How’d he find out?

10:19.785 --> 10:20.828
I told him.

-Hey.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.841

10:34.258 --> 10:36.302
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I’d say hello.

-What makes you think that?
-Don’t lie to me, <i>Prima.</i>

She have any reason to ask me
to check up on you?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.226
No.

-Now who’s lying?
-What are you talking about?

from your bag lately?

beat me for them.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.571
When did you start in with that stuff?

10:56.197 --> 10:59.116
It’s not like they’re hard-core narcotics.
They’re disco biscuits.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.660
People die from those things.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.536
Not to mention the fact
that they’re illegal.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.457
Listen, I got a guy.
We go to a club, we have a good time.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.876
-It’s all good.
-No, it’s not.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.545
-Think back to when you were 19.
-We are not talking about me.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.131
What? Were you a saint back in the day?

11:15.883 --> 11:17.301
-Who’s the guy?
-You want to meet him?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.844
-Sure.
-BOBBY: Huh.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.805
Ah. You tell him
he either delivers the tops

11:20.888 --> 11:23.182
with the jeans or the order’s canceled.
You got it?

11:23.849 --> 11:26.227
-Guapo, ¿no?
-Give my love to Cheryl.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.065
-Hey, what’s doing?
-I want you to meet my cousin, Rita.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.401
-Hi, cousin Rita.
-Bobby Friedman.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.152
-How’s it going?
-See anything you like?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.987
I just stopped in to see Paula.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.031
-You live in the city?
-Brooklyn.

-You’re a beautiful girl.
-Hey.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.620
-What, I can’t say that?
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah, you can.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.789
Maybe she wants to go out
this one night, this weekend.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.416
Uh, I don’t think I can this weekend.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.836
-It could be wild.
-Rita’s a detective, Bobby.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.048
Well, detectives get to have fun
sometimes.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.926
-Maybe some other time.
-You bet.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.638
-So, I gotta run, babe.
-When are we leaving for Atlantic City?

12:02.763 --> 12:06.392
We gotta be there by nine o' clock,
so figure 6:30.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.811
I’ll go home to get my clothes.
I’ll meet you at your apartment?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.438
All right. Don’t be late.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.107
-Nice meeting you.
-Same.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.069
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

12:24.660 --> 12:27.329
-Where were you last night, Antoine?
-With my girlfriend.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.248
-Didn’t go out?
-Didn’t go out.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.084
When Gene Stratis fired you,
did he owe you money?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.295
Well, somebody rob him
and y’all think it was me?

12:34.378 --> 12:35.379
JOHN: Somebody killed him.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.007
-And you think that’s me?
-We’re not ruling it out.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
-I don’t believe this.
-Why’d he fire you?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.470
For kissing my girlfriend.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.305
ANDY: No, you gotta do better
than that, Antoine.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.640
I'm telling you he usually comes in
at 4:00 to start up the grill.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.226
One day, he asked me to do it.
I knew I couldn’t get up that early,

12:49.310 --> 12:52.688
so I just stayed up, came in with my girl.
He walked in on us making out,

12:53.063 --> 12:54.940
said she’s gotta get out, rough, though.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.692
I told him he was out of line.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.527
One thing led to another,
and I’m out on my ass.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.031
-So he was disrespectful to your girl.
-I wasn’t gonna let it go, that's right.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.492
His bim coming around,
I’m nothing but nice.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.118
He can manage to be nice to mine.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.454
What’s his bim’s name? Do you know?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.665
Margo... something.
I don’t know her last name.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.793
And this was a serious relationship
he had?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.669
I guess so, I don’t know.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.131
He said he took out an insurance policy
for her ’cause that was the way

13:19.215 --> 13:20.216
to keep ’em in line.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.968
Fat Greek, stained on his pants
and a hearing aid,

13:23.052 --> 13:24.678
telling me how to keep ’em in line.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.390
Anyone besides your girlfriend
can vouch for you being home last night?

13:28.766 --> 13:30.643
My parole officer called around 11:00.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.813
You’re gonna have to stay here
while we check with him.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.565
You gonna tell him about the joint?

13:36.690 --> 13:38.943
If you’re telling us the truth,
we’ll leave it be our little secret.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.536
-Hey, you wanna grab some lunch?
-I can’t. I gotta do this.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.662
Okay.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.459
Hey, I ran a credit card check on your
D.O.A. the only recent hit

13:55.543 --> 13:57.336
-was from a video rental store.
-All right.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.798
I’ll leave it to you to figure out
what a grown man was doing with Mulan

14:00.881 --> 14:02.007
and <i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

14:10.766 --> 14:13.394
Thanks for coming in, Sheila.
Why don’t you have a seat?

14:13.477 --> 14:14.478
Sure.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.440
-You know about Paul Westerville?
-Yeah.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.401
Brendan told me, it’s awful.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.528
-How well did you know him?
-Just from his doing those ads

14:22.653 --> 14:23.737
that Brendan was in.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.781
You see him when they were taking
pictures or that kinda thing?

14:25.906 --> 14:26.907
Uh-huh.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.743
There were a lot of calls
from his cellphone to your cellphone.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.662
I’d make the arrangements.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.248
He’d sometimes call you
two, three times a day.

14:34.748 --> 14:38.460
Well, with getting parking for the van
and this and that.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.170
The arrangements could be complicated.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.090
Was there something going on
between you two?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.633
No.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.760
Look, Sheila,
this is a homicide investigation.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.554
If you’re lying to us,
we’re gonna find out.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.187
I prayed this day would never come.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.649
I prayed that I could just die
with my secret.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.320
-When did it start?
-Last summer.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.949
Paul rented a house out in Bellport.
He’d have us there for the weekend.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.786
We’d drive into town,
get stuff for dinner, and he’d start in.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.790
This one time, he got me in a weak moment.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.627
Was that the one time,
or were there other weak moments?

15:21.253 --> 15:22.546
There were other weak moments.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.216
-Who else knows about it?
-As far as I know, no one does.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.638
I’m 28 years old, you know?
I have physical needs.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.766
-We’re not here to pass judgment.
-Brendan and I were a normal couple,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.184
until this happened to him.

15:35.559 --> 15:40.105
-Yeah, I’m sure it’s difficult.
-I drive him places, I take care of him.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.443
I clean up after him, and I love him more
now than I loved him before,

15:44.526 --> 15:50.115
and I was sick in love with him before.
But yeah... it's difficult.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.243
Sometimes it’s real difficult.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.207
Does Brendan have to find out?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.377
Let’s hope not.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.603
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, Josh,

16:19.937 --> 16:22.147
could you make Miss Wiley
comfortable in interview three?

16:22.272 --> 16:23.399
Sure, right this way.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.651
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-How’s it looking?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.821
Uh, apparently this guy gave out
life insurance policies

16:28.904 --> 16:31.865
like they were party favors.
Got the name of the broker from the son.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.284
In addition to the policies naming
the ex-wives

16:34.493 --> 16:36.829
and kids is beneficiaries.
This time he started seeing someone.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.664
He’d just take out another policy
naming her.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.291
-The one you just brought in?
-She’s a real slugger.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.628
She got priors for assault
and assault with a deadly weapon.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.840
She’s also got a young kid,
and this guy rented two kids’ movies

16:47.923 --> 16:49.174
on the day he was killed.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.052
-Sounds like a definite candidate.
-We’ll let you know.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.890
Thanks, Josh.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.935
So, what kind of an insurance scam?

17:00.060 --> 17:02.521
Oh, yeah sure. We’re just trying
to find out as much as we can

17:02.604 --> 17:04.690
about policies written
by this particular broker.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.484
Well, Gene took care of all of that.
I don’t know anything about it.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.946
It’s a little unusual to be named
beneficiary by a boyfriend, isn't it?

17:11.321 --> 17:12.948
Gene isn’t your usual boyfriend.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.702
He knew I had concerns,
for myself, for my daughter.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.620
He did what he could
to put my mind at ease.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.747
How old’s your daughter?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.999
-She’s ten.
-ANDY: Where were you last night, Margo?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.294
-Why are you asking me that?
-Part of the investigation.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.215
I took Jaycee to her figure-skating
lesson, then I took her home.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.342
You go out at some point?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.345
No, I didn't. What does any of that
have to do with an insurance scam?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.514
Gene Stratis was killed last night.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.894
Don’t... don’t tell me that.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.188
-Did you go over there last night, Margo?
-How was he killed?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.899
If you went over there with your daughter,
at some point last night,

17:46.982 --> 17:47.983
you want to tell us that.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.277
Why, do you think I killed him
and I’m lying?

17:50.360 --> 17:51.987
Here’s what we’re looking at, Margo.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.239
You were arrested
for assaulting your ex-husband.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.449
That was self-defense.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.035
You were arrested for threatening
an ex-boyfriend with a knife.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.953
I was having a lot of problems
at the time.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.040
You were the beneficiary
of Stratis’ life insurance policy.

18:03.165 --> 18:06.376
And we have reason to believe that there
was a child present in his apartment.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.879
-I don’t go there with my child.
-Why is that?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.802
It was best he wasn’t around her.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.013
Girl children were a problem for him.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.641
You... you mean sexually?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.645
-Yeah.
-And you still continued to see him?

18:25.395 --> 18:27.856
I don’t know
that he ever acted on his temptations.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.691
I don’t think that’s true, Margo.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.861
He was very good to me.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.157
Now, that might not sound like
very much to you,

18:37.491 --> 18:40.285
but in my stage of the game,
it meant a lot.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.371
I’m sure it meant a lot to every woman

18:42.496 --> 18:44.915
that he took out
a life insurance policy for.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.042
But we’re gonna look into those women.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.796
And what do you want to bet that every one
of them had a young daughter, too?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.675
-I kept my daughter away from him.
-Except when you didn’t.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.180
He couldn’t do just anything.

19:00.973 --> 19:05.936
I was very clear with him about what I was
and was not willing to tolerate.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.439
-In other words, no penetration.
-Of any kind, that’s right.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.277
-Did he forget?
-ANDY: Or did it just turn your stomach

19:13.360 --> 19:15.445
that you were letting him do what he did?

19:15.571 --> 19:18.073
Maybe that was enough for you
to stick the knife in him.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.703
Last night, I took my daughter
to her figure-skating lesson.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.830
You’re gonna stay here
while we verify that.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.005
Anything come in on pattern robberies
in the area of your crime scene?

19:33.088 --> 19:35.883
Uh, actually we’re not so sure
it was a robbery.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.677
But we need to do more canvassing.
And we need to go through security tapes

19:38.760 --> 19:39.887
from parking garages in the area.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.348
If you’re thinking it’s not a robbery,

19:43.515 --> 19:45.017
you'll let me know
what you’re thinking it is.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.394
We’ll tell you what we have.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.107
-Ortiz. In my office.
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

19:58.155 --> 19:59.198
Sorry.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
Close the door.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.041
You run a guy named
Robert Friedman through B.C.I?

20:09.374 --> 20:11.168
-Yeah.
-On what case?

20:11.418 --> 20:12.836
(SIGHS) There was no case, boss.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.048
He’s going out with my cousin.
I met the guy.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.967
-Something about him struck me as wrong.
-You know better than that.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.638
-Is there a problem with him?
-A flag popped up when you ran him.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.015
The Joint Narcotics Task Force
has him as a target.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.518
My instincts about him were right,
at least.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.771
Now give me some case number
I can go back to them with.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.607
And... don’t let this happen again.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.484
Thanks, boss.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.916
-Thanks for meeting me, Ernie.
-What, are you kidding me?

20:51.124 --> 20:53.794
I’ve been waiting for this phone call
ever since I heard you were single.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.380
(CHUCKLES) Will it disappoint you
to find out I have a favor to ask?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.006
No, baby. What do you need?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.842
There’s a guy named Bobby Friedman,
my cousin’s been seeing.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.137
I ran him found out he’s the target
of a narcotics investigation

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
that your unit’s conducting.
I just want to know what he’s up to.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.934
This the Bobby Friedman
that owns the clothing store?

21:09.184 --> 21:10.227
Right.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.647
-This stays between you and me, right?
-Absolutely.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.358
We’re taking him down tonight
in Atlantic City

21:16.483 --> 21:17.901
on a half million dollars’ worth
of ecstasy.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.736
(SIGHS)

21:19.820 --> 21:21.947
I guess I won’t need to worry about him
too much longer, will I?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.326
Now, uh, let’s get back
to you being single.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.954
Thanks, Ernie. I owe you one.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.632
-When’s the last time you saw your father?
-Last summer.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.426
-Not since then?
-Right.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.220
Any reason you didn’t see him
over the holidays?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.098
Uh, it just didn’t work out that way.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.351
-Where were you last night, Melanie?
-I was home.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.312
-Anyone with you?
-My daughter.

21:53.395 --> 21:56.231
She’s had a fever, and I stayed home
to take care of her.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.860
Melanie, we have to ask you this question.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.363
And we apologize if it’s uncomfortable
for you but...

22:04.197 --> 22:06.366
were you ever sexually molested
by your father?

22:08.327 --> 22:11.371
I don’t think I’m obligated
to discuss that if I don’t want to.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.249
Now the problem is,
this is a homicide investigation.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.334
I don’t care.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.171
Melanie, it’s our job to find out
any pertinent information.

22:19.504 --> 22:24.676
But, what you asked about is my business,
and it doesn’t concern anyone but me.

22:24.843 --> 22:29.056
So if I don’t care to discuss it,
then I don’t have to discuss it.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.600
We don’t know
if your father’s sexual history

22:31.683 --> 22:33.143
was related to him being killed.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.437
That’s right. (SIGHS) You don’t.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.398
One way or another, we are gonna
find out what that history was.

22:39.191 --> 22:43.570
In other words, you’re going to drag me
into it whether I like it or not?

22:44.071 --> 22:47.240
If his sexual history involves you, yeah.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.659
We don’t have a choice.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.791
The first time I remember him
molesting me, I was nine years old.

22:57.709 --> 23:01.588
About a year later, he did it again.
Then again when I was 11.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.258
On Easter Sunday.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.140
In my yellow Easter dress.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.270
With my new Mary Janes
under the chair in my room.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.942
The following fall, I was sent away
to boarding school.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.194
Did you tell anyone?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.199
-I told my mother, I told my brother.
-What did they do?

23:30.450 --> 23:32.411
The first couple times,
my mother said I imagined it.

23:32.494 --> 23:37.332
My brother said it was just roughhousing,
and I took it the wrong way.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.087
When I ran away after that Easter Sunday,
my mother decided I was crazy.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.631
She sent me to a shrink.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.510
And then because I begged her,
and because the shrink said

23:48.593 --> 23:51.388
it was a good idea,
I was sent away to boarding school.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.014
(DOOR OPENS)

23:56.184 --> 23:57.477
Hey. (SOBS)

24:02.816 --> 24:04.359
She’s never seen him.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.361
And now she never will.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.794
-(SIGHS) I got a problem.
-What?

24:23.211 --> 24:24.671
My cousin’s dating a bad guy.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.384
He’s gonna get taken down tonight
in a federal narcotics bust,

24:29.509 --> 24:32.095
-and she’s planning on being with him.
-What are you gonna do?

24:33.096 --> 24:34.931
This idiot’s got her using ecstasy.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.895
If we could have somebody snatch her up
and put her into the system overnight,

24:40.270 --> 24:43.190
-at least she wouldn’t be there with him.
-I'll do it.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.984
-You sure?
-Where’s she gonna be?

24:46.234 --> 24:48.195
She lives with my aunt
over on Columbia street.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.739
I know she’ll be going there
between 4:30 and 5:00,

24:50.864 --> 24:52.616
and she’ll be holding enough
for a misdemeanor.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.410
I’ll need a description,
an address, and a photo.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.579
I got one in my bag.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.664
Thanks, Laura.

25:05.128 --> 25:09.633
I don’t know how much help I can be.
I hadn’t seen Gene in quite some time.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.052
What was the relationship between
Gene and your daughter?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.388
-Not very good.
-Why was that?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.558
(SIGHS)
Melanie had difficulty growing up. She...

25:19.434 --> 25:22.229
she was kind of a sad child. I...

25:22.395 --> 25:25.982
I think she always felt as though
her brother enjoyed a closer relationship

25:26.107 --> 25:29.486
-with Gene than she did.
-Well, she claims Gene molested her.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.197
I know she does.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.951
I think it gives her something to blame
her difficulties on.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.247
-You don’t hold out any chance it’s true?
-No, I don't.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.000
Gene may not have been the most
attentive of husbands,

25:44.084 --> 25:47.504
but as a father, those kids were lucky
to have him.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.423
-Is your daughter capable of killing him?
-No.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.551
She seems to have a lot of anger
towards him.

25:52.634 --> 25:57.931
It’s not something she would do.
She’s not a violent person, she’s quiet,

25:58.557 --> 25:59.558
shy.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.644
Just getting through her day-to-day life
is hard enough for her.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.021
She doesn’t think
in terms of killing anyone.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.856
How is her day-to-day life hard?

26:07.190 --> 26:10.026
She worries, about everything.

26:10.735 --> 26:16.157
From hurricanes to nuclear bombs
on the subway.

26:16.449 --> 26:20.161
One day, I called her, and she told me
the ice was melting on the North Pole

26:20.245 --> 26:22.372
and the weather was gonna change.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.834
I didn’t understand
what she was talking about.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.669
Did she worry about her daughter?

26:27.877 --> 26:29.129
Oh, constantly.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.882
It was only in the last year
that she let her stay overnight with me.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.219
And because the girl
absolutely adores her uncle.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.389
Once in a great while,
she lets her stay with my son.

26:41.516 --> 26:45.145
-You know the last time that happened?
-I think he had her yesterday.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.781
If we were narcotics, this would be like
shooting ducks in a barrel.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.455
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(SIREN WAILING)

27:05.373 --> 27:06.458
That’s her.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.339
-Police. We need you to come with us.
-What is this?

27:12.422 --> 27:13.840
-Who are you?
-We are detectives.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.508
Did you just engage in a drug transaction?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.761
-No.
-This is a known drug location.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.262
I live a block away from here.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.097
I was coming home from the subway.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.350
-You have any drugs in this bag?
-No.

27:27.937 --> 27:28.980
-What are these?
-Nothing.

27:29.939 --> 27:32.067
-They’re not even mine.
-Whose are they?

27:33.693 --> 27:34.944
Put your hands behind your back.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.156
-Am I under arrest?
-Yep.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.830
I hope you understand, Mr. Quinn.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.415
There’s some questions
we have to ask to you

27:47.499 --> 27:48.500
as a part of investigation.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.628
I was a cop for 35 years.
You don’t have to explain yourself.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.004
Thanks.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.049
Fire when ready.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.802
What was your relationship
with Paul Westerville?

27:59.928 --> 28:01.221
I didn’t have a relationship with him.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.974
He had a contract with the P.B.A.
He used my son a few times in the ads.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.727
If I was there, I’d talk to him.
That's it.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.813
Can you tell us where you were yesterday?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.357
This one’s moving in for the kill,
isn’t he?

28:13.149 --> 28:14.275
It’s a standard question.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.778
I know it’s a standard question, Johnny.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.365
Where was I yesterday?

28:20.615 --> 28:22.742
I did some chores around the house
in the morning.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.579
I walked over to the O.T.B.
on Springfield Boulevard.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.708
In the afternoon,
I grabbed myself something to eat

28:29.874 --> 28:32.585
at the Scobee Diner on Northern Boulevard.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.422
And I was back home by eight O'clock.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.465
We have evidence that your car

28:37.590 --> 28:39.175
was in a parking garage
in Manhattan yesterday.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.302
I don’t know where you got
that evidence from.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.430
As far as I know, my car was in Queens.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.599
It was I.D'd on a video from
a security camera in the parking garage.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.601
It wasn’t me.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.062
They’re your plates on the car.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.023
My car is parked on 221st street.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.944
Once a week, Tuesday mornings
between 10:00 and 12:00,

28:58.111 --> 29:00.071
the street sweepers come,
and I gotta move it.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.823
Other than that, it sits.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.492
And you’re telling me it was in the city?

29:09.497 --> 29:12.459
Old habits die hard.
I still leave my keys over the visor.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.919
Maybe somebody took it, brought it back.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.130
And I didn’t know nothing about it.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.298
Uh-huh.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.176
What kind of relationship do you have
with your daughter-in-law?

29:21.676 --> 29:23.470
-Excellent.
-Were you aware of her behaving

29:23.553 --> 29:25.889
in any inappropriate manner?
With regard to your son.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.515
No, I’m not.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.935
Did you ever have a conversation
with Paul Westerville’s secretary

29:31.060 --> 29:33.396
-regarding your daughter-in-law?
-No. I did not.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.690
She claims to have told you
that Paul Westerville

29:35.774 --> 29:38.318
had an illicit relationship
with your daughter-in-law.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.986
She’s mistaken.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.656
Is she also mistaken about you going
to see him after she told you that?

29:44.032 --> 29:46.451
Right, she’s mistaken about that, too.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.499
Mr. Quinn...

29:54.167 --> 29:56.294
There’s a sign-in log in Westerville’s
office building.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.712
There are security camera tapes.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.299
You’re not gonna find my name
in any sign-in books.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.761
You’re not gonna I.D. me
from any security camera tapes.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.138
You wanna check my guns?

30:07.430 --> 30:09.808
I’ll sign a consent form.
You can test-fire everyone of them.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.768
We know we could understand
you being angry.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.186
We can understand you're going the same.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.104
We can understand that there might
have been a struggle.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.233
Save yourself the exercise, kid.
I didn’t go see him.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.693
There was no struggle. I didn’t kill him.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.909
Now, you want me to wait around here,
while you figure out what you’re gonna do?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.871
-Yeah.
-No problem.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.881
-What do we know now?
-Uh, nothing solid yet.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.258
The father did it.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.219
I don’t know if there’s enough to convict,
but there’s no doubt he's in.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.471
-I’ll talk to the D.A.
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

30:51.307 --> 30:54.644
The one thing is the reason why he killed
Westerville is because his son’s wife

30:54.727 --> 30:55.854
was having an affair with him.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.148
Now if we make an arrest,
his son’s gonna know about that affair.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.526
I don’t know if there’s anything
we can do about that.

31:02.944 --> 31:03.945
I understand.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.641
-Can you get me out?
-I can’t get you out right away.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.811
Fortunately, the amount you were busted
with was small enough.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.022
So they’ll release you in the morning,
on your own recognizance.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.025
-I have to stay here overnight?
-Yeah, you do.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.861
That’s what happens
you get caught with illegal drugs.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.989
I’ve never been in jail before.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.950
Think about what it would feel like
to stay in for a few years.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.702
(SNIFFLES)

31:53.036 --> 31:54.746
Why did they even stop me, though?

31:54.871 --> 31:57.123
The question you should be asking is
why did you have the drugs?

31:57.540 --> 32:01.961
You were going past a known drug location.
They did what narcotics cops do.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.844
I talked to them outside.
They’ll keep you in a segregated cell.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.179
No one’s gonna bother you.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.598
Does my mother have to find out?

32:14.974 --> 32:15.975
Yeah.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.811
Would you tell her I’m sorry?

32:21.189 --> 32:23.483
(SOBS)

32:24.692 --> 32:25.777
Shh.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.702
You were taking care of your niece
yesterday, Alex?

32:34.911 --> 32:38.039
My sister had to work late, so,
she parked her with me for a few hours.

32:38.623 --> 32:42.043
-What’d you do with her?
-Walked, window-shopped.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.629
Then I took her back to my apartment.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.339
Did you take her
to your father’s apartment?

32:46.422 --> 32:47.799
-No.
-Why not?

32:48.675 --> 32:50.009
He’s always tired after work.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.595
He had rented <i>Mulan</i>
and <i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

32:52.679 --> 32:54.305
-Why would he have done that?
-I've no idea.

32:55.598 --> 32:59.185
Maybe the video store ran someone else’s
rentals on his card. Who knows?

33:00.603 --> 33:02.230
You loved your father, didn’t you, Alex?

33:03.898 --> 33:05.024
Yeah.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.113
Did you think it was right that he didn’t
get to see his granddaughter?

33:10.405 --> 33:11.864
That was between him and my sister.

33:11.948 --> 33:15.159
-But you felt bad about it, though, right?
-Yeah. I felt bad.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.121
He worked hard all his life.
He provided for his family.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.582
And now all he wants is to spend
a little time with his granddaughter,

33:21.666 --> 33:23.418
and you’re gonna deny that to him?

33:23.501 --> 33:25.920
I told you, that was between him
and my sister.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.756
Yeah, except he didn’t talk
to your sister, he talked to you.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.633
And the kid was with you.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.803
You were in a position that you could do
something nice for your dad

33:33.886 --> 33:36.389
and at the same time show your sister
that he wasn’t the monster

33:36.472 --> 33:38.891
-she made him out to be.
-And you’re a good son, Alex.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.437
-You did what a good son does.
-No, I... I didn’t do anything.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.898
We’ll talk to your niece if we have to,
Alex.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.943
We’ll get her in the room, and
we’ll ask her where she was yesterday.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.821
Where she was and what happened to her.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.911
He wanted to give her dinner.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.831
And he wanted it to be
just the two of them.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.585
And what did you find
when you came back for her?

34:06.711 --> 34:07.920
She was sitting on the couch.

34:10.673 --> 34:13.760
The movie was playing in the V.C.R,
but she wasn’t watching it.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.014
He was in the other room.
All she said to me was...

34:19.474 --> 34:21.142
that her underpants were on backwards.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.479
What did you do?

34:24.645 --> 34:27.273
I told her to go into the bathroom.
To turn them back around.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.943
Then I took her home to her mother.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.988
Then you went to your dad’s
coffee shop to confront him?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.782
I had to ask him, you know?

34:37.283 --> 34:41.120
I had to hear from him,
what he did, if he did anything.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.289
And what did he tell you?

34:43.790 --> 34:47.668
He got this weird, ashamed smile
on his face.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.130
He said, "Sometimes we make mistakes."

34:55.218 --> 34:57.512
Yeah. Like I made a mistake with him.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.432
Like all those years ago
when I stood up for him to my sister,

35:01.933 --> 35:03.768
tried to convince her
that it didn’t happen.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.939
Stood next to my mother and said,
"Pop would never do that."

35:09.649 --> 35:11.067
Now here’s this little kid,

35:14.487 --> 35:15.655
there because of me.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.451
She’s got that same look
on her face that my sister had.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.831
I grabbed the knife,
and I stuck it in him.

35:26.874 --> 35:30.253
He looked at me like,
"How could you do this to me?"

35:32.672 --> 35:33.965
I don’t know, Pop.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.928
How could you do that to them?

35:42.223 --> 35:43.432
(SOBS)

35:45.059 --> 35:46.727
How do we know
the wife was having an affair?

35:47.603 --> 35:48.604
She admitted it.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.898
And we can put the father-in-law
at the vicinity of the crime scene,

35:51.023 --> 35:52.233
but not at the crime scene itself?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.403
You can try. He claims not to have used
the car all week,

35:55.486 --> 35:57.446
and if it was in the vicinity
of the crime scene,

35:57.530 --> 35:58.739
somebody else drove it there.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.241
He knew about the affair?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.451
Westerville’s secretary claims
to have told him.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.162
Sounds like she hated Westerville.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.622
Not exactly an impartial witness.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.333
Hmm. Ballistics will be useless.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.170
Whatever gun he used,
you can be sure you’ll never find it.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.214
Oh, you should proceed with your
investigation, but with what you have now,

36:15.339 --> 36:17.425
I don’t think my boss is gonna
want to go to bat with it.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.968
Do you need to run it by him?

36:19.343 --> 36:22.513
Ask a grand jury to indict a retired cop
whose looking out for his son.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.683
A hero cop, confined to a wheelchair,
whose wife’s cheating on him.

36:25.975 --> 36:29.145
And who has a trunkful of alibis?
I don’t think so.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.732
-I’ll see what more we come up with.
-Let me know when you come up with it.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.528
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

36:37.945 --> 36:39.322
-Hey, good looking.
-Hey.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.991
What makes you think I was talking to you?

36:47.413 --> 36:48.414
He go for it?

36:48.581 --> 36:50.583
He found out his father molested
his niece.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.669
-He’s writing up a statement now.
-That’ll knock it down to manslaughter.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.671
He’s still gonna do five years.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.424
Oh, nothing we can do about that,
unfortunately.

37:02.970 --> 37:06.015
Oh, uh, Brendan Quinn left a message
for you. Dinner at 8:00.

37:06.849 --> 37:07.975
Just like the play.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.356
You’ve given me
everything you’ve got on this?

37:13.648 --> 37:15.441
-Yeah.
-If that’s true,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.194
I don’t see a case against
Charlie Quinn making.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.489
I’ll go kick him.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.704
Um, I’d like to know
what’s going on with my brother.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.582
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:33.376 --> 37:35.211
Why don’t you come on back here, Melanie?

37:49.976 --> 37:52.270
Your brother’s confessed
to killing your father.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.147
There may be a trial. There may be a plea.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.776
The likelihood is that
he’s gonna spend some time in prison.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.071
Why did he kill him?

38:03.447 --> 38:05.616
When he took care
of your daughter yesterday...

38:07.785 --> 38:10.037
(SIGHS) ...he let your father watch her.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.207
No.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.714
Oh, my God. (SOBS)

38:21.716 --> 38:23.426
Your father’s not gonna do this
to anyone else.

38:23.718 --> 38:27.221
(SNIFFLES) But he did it to her.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.558
He did it to me.
And now he did it to her.

38:30.683 --> 38:34.270
He did it to a bunch of kids.
That’s awful and terrible.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.565
And I wish we could have nailed him
long ago.

38:39.942 --> 38:42.236
But now you have a chance
to do for your daughter

38:42.320 --> 38:43.863
what your mother never did for you.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.158
The damage has already been done.
I can’t do anything about that.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.869
You can tell her
that she doesn’t have to keep it a secret.

38:50.786 --> 38:54.749
Tell her that you know she isn’t crazy,
you know she isn’t making it up.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.960
That she has nothing to be ashamed of.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.421
Where is my brother now?

39:01.255 --> 39:03.466
-He’s inside.
-I’d like to talk to him.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.302
You may want to wait on that.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.139
I’d like to tell him I’m not angry at him,
and I think he needs to hear that now.

40:01.273 --> 40:04.568
-Sheila, the lasagna’s fantastic.
-Thank you.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.447
We’re planning a trip to Italy,
speaking of lasagna.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.033
-Brendan’s never been there.
-I’ve never been there, either.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.077
Well, first you gotta get
somebody to go with.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.287
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, that’s true.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.082
Hey, honey,
can I have a minute with Baldwin?

40:18.499 --> 40:19.500
Sure.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.298
Now she figured out all the logistics,

40:26.507 --> 40:28.717
what hotels are best
for accommodating a chair,

40:28.801 --> 40:31.011
-ev... everything.
-Uh, that's great.

40:31.637 --> 40:35.474
(SIGHS) Not the easiest thing in the world
being married to me.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.768
Um... she seems to be doing okay.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.273
I want you to know
I had a little talk with her.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.733
Also with my father.

40:46.902 --> 40:51.115
I let them both know that I can,
uh, accept certain things.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.078
What are we talking about, Brendan?

40:57.413 --> 41:00.458
My wife loves me.
I don’t have any doubt about that.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.751
We talk, we laugh.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.255
There’s a million and one things
we know about each other

41:06.464 --> 41:09.049
that no one else in the world
will ever know, but...

41:11.760 --> 41:14.638
But I also know there’s things she needs
that she can’t get from me.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.517
Things that maybe she can
only get from another person.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.354
I told her, I told my father,

41:23.272 --> 41:25.566
if it’s a choice between that
and losing her...

41:28.736 --> 41:30.029
I can accept it.

41:32.531 --> 41:35.618
-And your father understands this?
-Yeah. (SIGHS)

41:45.419 --> 41:47.004
I’m the luckiest guy in the world.

42:01.936 --> 42:06.524
