02:04.500 --> 02:06.701
<i>I first saw her in April...</i>

02:07.021 --> 02:11.943
<i>...when her parents moved from Arrame
on the other side of the pass.</i>

02:12.184 --> 02:17.386
<i>Her name was Eliane but everyone
called her Elle or "that girl".</i>

02:17.906 --> 02:22.468
<i>Her father, old Devigne, was paralysed
after a fall from a ladder.</i>

02:22.668 --> 02:28.371
<i>Her mother was German. Devigne
met her while doing forced labour.</i>

02:28.751 --> 02:31.032
They call her Eva Braun.

02:33.033 --> 02:37.555
Back to work. You don't even know
who Eva Braun was.

02:39.956 --> 02:46.239
<i>I first saw her at the cinema while on
fire duty. She was playing the star.</i>

02:46.399 --> 02:48.960
<i>She'd won a beauty contest...</i>

02:49.200 --> 02:51.201
<i>as "Miss Camping-Caravanning"...</i>

02:51.962 --> 02:53.982
<i>and acted like a star ever since.</i>

03:02.126 --> 03:04.807
<i>I thought she was good looking...</i>

03:05.248 --> 03:07.129
<i>but no more than that.</i>

03:07.289 --> 03:11.491
<i>She said she sat close to the screen
to get some peace.</i>

03:11.611 --> 03:15.973
<i>The truth was she wouldn't wear
glasses...</i>

03:16.133 --> 03:18.494
<i>and couldn't see from further back.</i>

03:24.257 --> 03:25.977
Get a move on!

03:26.818 --> 03:28.499
What's the hurry?

03:28.659 --> 03:31.420
Can't hang about. 'Bye.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.061
<i>Small towns are all alike.</i>

03:34.221 --> 03:39.263
<i>The film ends and thirty seconds later
everyone has vanished.</i>

03:44.146 --> 03:49.167
<i>With M. Loubet's wife there wasn't much
time for words. We used the aisle...</i>

03:50.389 --> 03:53.390
<i>to have a carpet under us.</i>

04:02.034 --> 04:05.355
The place needs a coat of paint.

04:12.839 --> 04:18.000
<i>I usually drove my brother's van home.
His driving sent me crazy.</i>

04:22.243 --> 04:25.525
<i>We'd load up the back with kids.</i>

04:28.646 --> 04:31.327
<i>They'd fall fast asleep on the way.</i>

04:33.808 --> 04:35.249
Everyone's asleep here.

04:43.653 --> 04:47.695
I've stopped. A fireman needs
all his puff.

04:48.415 --> 04:51.617
Before, I smoked like a chimney.

04:56.259 --> 04:58.020
Find yourself a girl?

04:58.140 --> 05:00.020
Eva Braun's daughter.

05:01.261 --> 05:03.382
You done it with her?

05:03.502 --> 05:05.543
Not tonight. Her mother was with us.

05:05.663 --> 05:08.104
What about other nights?

05:08.985 --> 05:12.386
Twice. Last Saturday and the one before.

05:12.506 --> 05:13.547
Where?

05:13.747 --> 05:16.308
In the van on a tarpaulin.

05:18.749 --> 05:20.310
How was it?

05:20.430 --> 05:24.472
What an arse! Really something.

05:25.152 --> 05:30.795
It was too cold to undress. I just
pulled up her skirt.

05:31.995 --> 05:32.996
What an arse!

05:38.038 --> 05:40.799
You get nought for conversation.

05:41.359 --> 05:44.481
You're a fine bunch.

05:46.282 --> 05:48.763
Don't call me Pin-Pon.

05:53.365 --> 05:55.406
What is it? What's going on?

05:57.727 --> 05:59.488
I'll catch pneumonia!

05:59.648 --> 06:00.848
I thought you were in a hurry.

06:02.569 --> 06:05.971
If I die, I'll take you with me.

06:06.091 --> 06:08.572
<i>My brother, Mickey, is a haulier
and amateur cyclist.</i>

06:09.852 --> 06:12.174
<i>He's as daft as a brush...</i>

06:12.294 --> 06:17.096
<i>but we get on well. We don't need
to talk much.</i>

06:17.416 --> 06:20.057
You ass. Now there's no more water!

06:24.939 --> 06:25.900
Mother!

06:26.100 --> 06:31.422
<i>My other brother, 13 years younger
than me, was born when father died.</i>

06:31.462 --> 06:35.504
<i>He's the intellectual of the family.</i>

06:35.624 --> 06:39.186
<i>Father would call him "Doctor"
if he were still alive.</i>

06:39.386 --> 06:43.108
<i>Our father walked here, all the way
from Southern Italy.</i>

06:43.268 --> 06:47.150
<i>Like all Italians, he was set on going
to America...</i>

06:47.310 --> 06:50.871
<i>but he never had enough money
for the ticket.</i>

06:51.031 --> 06:55.233
<i>He ended up marrying my mother
who came from Digne.</i>

06:55.954 --> 07:01.916
<i>They took in her sister who's been
stone deaf since Marseilles was bombed.</i>

07:02.036 --> 07:05.638
<i>She's called Cognata by everyone
but my mother.</i>

07:09.880 --> 07:12.001
What vegetables do you want?

07:12.961 --> 07:14.162
What's that?

07:14.402 --> 07:18.704
She wants peas as usual
on Sundays.

07:19.765 --> 07:22.046
Ace, two and three, as usual.

07:22.366 --> 07:28.769
My aunt's choice never varies. "Don't
confuse Fate," she says. And it works.

07:28.969 --> 07:31.090
She's won twice

08:01.544 --> 08:02.564
I'd go for her.

08:02.904 --> 08:05.105
What with, may one ask?

08:05.666 --> 08:08.147
It's not that difficult,

08:08.347 --> 08:13.069
The town chemist and a visiting friend
of my nephew's had her.

08:13.189 --> 08:16.751
And even one of those Portuguese
workers.

08:29.356 --> 08:30.317
Wake up.

08:31.237 --> 08:33.038
A fellow needs a break.

08:33.118 --> 08:37.559
If your eyes were that blowtorch,
she'd not sit down for a week.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.722
<i>We all call my boss Henry IV. He's
the best boules player I know.</i>

08:43.582 --> 08:47.485
<i>I went to school with his wife,
Josette.</i>

08:47.525 --> 08:49.926
Can I fetch your mother anything?

08:50.046 --> 08:55.208
Some steaks. Five normal and a big
one for Bou-Bou. Say they're for us.

08:55.408 --> 08:59.010
- Why?
- You know steak like he knows limos.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.412
<i>I've a Delahaye with leather seats.</i>

09:02.532 --> 09:06.013
<i>I swapped her for an old van.</i>

09:06.173 --> 09:10.575
<i>She takes up all my spare time
but she still won't go.</i>

09:10.615 --> 09:14.737
Three hundred metres. Sixty metres.
Better than last time.

09:14.857 --> 09:18.659
- It's the gaskets.
- You saw me change them.

09:18.779 --> 09:21.100
She's allergic to gaskets.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.501
No, it's the oil intake.

09:23.541 --> 09:27.903
If you ask me, she's allergic
to everything.

09:28.023 --> 09:30.384
We'd better push her back.

09:31.105 --> 09:34.386
- Poor Pin-Pon!
- Don't call me that!

09:34.586 --> 09:36.387
Mrs Nosey Parker.

09:36.587 --> 09:41.550
What's to stop us making a complaint
about the pollution?

09:58.117 --> 10:02.239
- Do you know the Braun girl?
- Just about.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.601
If you want my advice, you'll keep
well away from her.

10:07.721 --> 10:09.842
I didn't ask your advice.

10:09.963 --> 10:13.764
You can meet her any Sunday at
the Bing Bang dance.

10:14.725 --> 10:18.086
That place makes me feel old.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.288
Come along and I'll do the rest.

10:21.528 --> 10:26.610
I don't need your help I can chat
her up as easily as you.

10:29.371 --> 10:32.453
You're wrong there. I'm not smitten!

10:45.899 --> 10:49.581
<i>The Bing Bang came to one village or
another each Sunday.</i>

10:49.741 --> 10:52.942
<i>The kids followed it around.</i>

10:53.062 --> 10:58.465
<i>For a bit, I danced with Mickey's girl
who works In the post office.</i>

12:16.621 --> 12:20.502
- Where's Mickey?
- Gone to play boules.

12:29.386 --> 12:31.868
Come on, I'll be the man.

12:35.029 --> 12:36.390
Shall we dance?

12:37.190 --> 12:40.151
What's the alternative? Climbing trees?

12:44.874 --> 12:47.755
<i>That knocked me back a bit.</i>

12:47.875 --> 12:51.837
<i>What's more, I hate people with
clammy hands.</i>

12:51.957 --> 12:55.318
<i>But hers were different. They were
damp...</i>

12:55.478 --> 13:00.161
<i>but they reminded me of babies
or children.</i>

14:02.149 --> 14:05.230
Don't you feel thirsty?

14:43.488 --> 14:45.129
I'm not a goldfish!

14:48.090 --> 14:50.131
Is your hair natural?

14:50.171 --> 14:52.972
No, it costs me a fortune.

14:58.535 --> 15:03.057
There's a good restaurant near
Cavaillon. Care to go some time?

15:04.898 --> 15:07.899
Candles on the table, silver cutlery...

15:08.019 --> 15:09.900
Okay, take it easy.

15:11.421 --> 15:13.982
You won't get me in bed that way.

15:14.942 --> 15:16.143
That's a fact.

15:24.427 --> 15:30.549
Look, we can't stand here all night.
I can only dance on Sundays.

15:43.595 --> 15:45.876
I've got to go.

16:07.206 --> 16:10.388
- Who are you playing against?
- Locals.

16:10.568 --> 16:14.690
We're leading by three points.
Massigne is hopeless.

16:14.810 --> 16:17.211
To hell with Massigne!

16:18.451 --> 16:24.654
There's a fair at Thorame. Let's make
a foursome with Georgette and Moune.

16:24.814 --> 16:28.856
Moune isn't that bad, is she?

16:29.376 --> 16:32.178
Let's play rummy with Cognata tonight.

16:32.298 --> 16:38.401
And invite Henry IV when we return
the car. We'll drown our sorrows.

16:40.902 --> 16:43.623
I'll just lose this game and come.

16:44.984 --> 16:48.625
<i>I told myself there were other fish
in the sea...</i>

16:48.745 --> 16:51.987
<i>that she wasn't worth the trouble.</i>

16:54.588 --> 16:56.229
Anyone at home?

17:00.011 --> 17:01.691
I've a flat tyre.

17:01.731 --> 17:03.692
Move back a bit.

17:04.311 --> 17:07.273
As you repair cars, I thought
you'd do bikes.

17:11.356 --> 17:12.316
What fun!

17:12.696 --> 17:14.537
You'll get dirty!

17:18.358 --> 17:20.040
What's she doing here?

17:20.260 --> 17:25.202
- Her bike needs repairing.
- Tell her to take herself off.

17:29.004 --> 17:33.926
Your tyre has a huge rip in it.
How did that happen?

17:36.847 --> 17:41.449
Come back tomorrow. I've some spare
tyres at home.

17:41.610 --> 17:43.851
When do you stop work?

17:44.011 --> 17:45.211
Not for another hour. Maybe longer.

17:47.532 --> 17:49.653
I'll wait outside.

17:56.016 --> 17:58.257
<i>She sat motionless.</i>

18:00.159 --> 18:02.420
<i>Like a doll thrown in a corner.</i>

18:05.621 --> 18:08.102
<i>Mother detests anything in a skirt.</i>

18:08.262 --> 18:10.303
<i>She'd even hate a Scotsman.</i>

18:10.823 --> 18:12.023
I've a bike to mend.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.791
Your brother cornered me last night.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.792
- Mickey?
- No, Bou-Bou.

18:32.033 --> 18:35.954
He asked me what I'd done to you.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.596
When I said, "nothing" he got all
hoity-toity and said...

18:39.876 --> 18:41.637
"So why was he upset?"

18:42.317 --> 18:43.278
So silly.

18:46.479 --> 18:48.640
What made you go?

18:48.720 --> 18:52.282
Misgivings - because of
Georges Massigne.

18:52.762 --> 18:55.884
I'd have you know I belong to nobody.

18:58.685 --> 19:00.966
And we're not together any more.

19:04.247 --> 19:07.689
Do you really have a barrel organ
in your barn?

19:07.969 --> 19:09.170
Who told you?

19:09.490 --> 19:12.091
Bou-Bou did, when we made it up.

19:13.732 --> 19:18.334
That's all our father left us when
he died. Four walls...

19:18.894 --> 19:20.015
and the organ.

19:20.255 --> 19:22.136
Does it still work?

19:22.376 --> 19:28.479
Yes, on its own sometimes, if a mouse
gets in. But it has only one tune.

19:39.984 --> 19:41.985
You did it on purpose?

19:43.585 --> 19:44.586
To see me?

19:50.589 --> 19:51.989
With secateurs.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.672
Pin-Pon isn't a real name. What were
you christened?

19:59.353 --> 20:02.034
My real name is Florimondo.

20:02.154 --> 20:06.516
But the Italians were against us
in the war...

20:06.636 --> 20:09.437
so it didn't go down well
in the village.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.142
- Could we go to your restaurant?
- Anytime.

20:19.242 --> 20:22.523
Why not now? At once.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.444
Tell you what.

20:25.885 --> 20:31.888
If you go round the back, you can choose
which dress I wear.

20:32.128 --> 20:33.528
All right?

20:36.009 --> 20:40.892
<i>That's why I couldn't do without her
She lived life in top gear.</i>

21:01.341 --> 21:02.702
<i>It was wonderful.</i>

21:02.902 --> 21:06.423
<i>For that moment, I'd start all over
again.</i>

21:08.024 --> 21:09.065
Hurry up!

21:11.106 --> 21:12.306
Bou-Bou's belt.

21:15.668 --> 21:17.268
Where is he going'?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.389
Nobody tells me anything.

21:19.549 --> 21:25.151
- He's meeting a client.
- What's her name?

21:27.233 --> 21:28.634
I don't know.

21:30.354 --> 21:33.796
If the fire station wants me, call
the restaurant.

21:33.916 --> 21:36.077
All right, but hurry up.

21:36.117 --> 21:37.958
- I'll do?
- Fantastic.

21:41.880 --> 21:46.482
Mother, I may be back late. Don't worry.

21:57.767 --> 21:58.968
Will I do?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.971
You look like Zorro!

22:08.692 --> 22:12.294
Go fast or I'll have to sit and wave
to the village.

22:19.617 --> 22:23.219
He drives well. The car won't suffer.

22:23.379 --> 22:26.340
Maybe, but it's the last time I lend it.

22:26.660 --> 22:28.581
Not feeling sick?

22:29.461 --> 22:30.822
You're joking.

22:31.703 --> 22:37.425
I'd spend my life in a car
if my stupid father could afford one.

22:37.665 --> 22:39.186
What was he before?

22:40.507 --> 22:42.507
A watchman and road man.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.348
He had a stroke?

22:45.789 --> 22:48.150
I don't want to talk about it.

22:51.752 --> 22:54.073
I've a Delahaye. Know what that is?

22:54.513 --> 22:56.954
No - except that it doesn't work.

22:57.154 --> 23:03.597
I'll make it work when I find the parts.
And then I'll take you on holiday.

23:05.438 --> 23:07.279
Oh, yes? Where?

23:07.519 --> 23:08.840
Wherever you like.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.202
All right. To Nice?

23:14.362 --> 23:17.203
To a crummy room where you'll screw me?

23:26.928 --> 23:30.409
It's incredible. What did I say?

23:34.091 --> 23:35.932
You bite your nails?

23:36.173 --> 23:38.373
- Don't look.
- They're false?

23:40.654 --> 23:44.696
Say anything and I'll tell everyone
you sleep with Mme Loubet.

23:44.816 --> 23:46.697
Who told you that?

23:46.817 --> 23:48.538
It's common knowledge.

23:48.658 --> 23:50.779
There's no point in telling, then.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.943
I promise I won't tell a soul.

24:01.584 --> 24:04.465
And I'll take you back if you prefer.

24:07.707 --> 24:08.787
No, don't.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.391
It's like Hollywood.

24:17.311 --> 24:18.471
You come often?

24:19.552 --> 24:22.954
I came once to fix a customer's car.

24:23.154 --> 24:26.475
You can laugh but I promised myself
I'd come back...

24:26.635 --> 24:31.137
with a glamorous girl like the ones
I saw that day.

24:32.998 --> 24:37.960
When I was little, they took me to
the eye doctor and we ate out.

24:40.562 --> 24:45.044
But there were oiled tablecloths and
fly papers It was squalid.

24:46.604 --> 24:47.645
Squalid.

24:47.965 --> 24:49.486
You've bad sight?

24:51.687 --> 24:52.887
I can't see my own feet.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.808
Why not wear glasses?

24:54.928 --> 24:56.429
Who cares about feet?

24:57.609 --> 24:59.170
The band leader!

24:59.210 --> 25:01.611
Has Mademoiselle chosen?

25:02.812 --> 25:07.374
A melon without port and strawberries,
if you have them.

25:09.455 --> 25:13.137
Perch with fennel and asparagus
to start with.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.298
What wine would you like?

25:17.539 --> 25:18.499
Not for me.

25:18.659 --> 25:22.741
- It makes me cry and cry.
- But tonight is special.

25:24.462 --> 25:28.904
- Which champagne?
- The one you always serve us.

25:32.786 --> 25:35.267
It was the Piper Heidsieck, wasn't it?

25:36.107 --> 25:38.188
Is there gold on the label?

25:38.308 --> 25:39.509
Gold? Yes, I think so.

25:41.109 --> 25:42.990
Then that will do.

25:52.875 --> 25:58.197
At school, I never listened. I repeated
the same year three times.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.759
In the end, they gave in and I left.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.080
You're not eating.

26:10.523 --> 26:13.684
But I was by far the prettiest.

26:14.685 --> 26:16.686
Everyone said so.

26:17.166 --> 26:23.089
At thirteen or fourteen I was fully
grown. Don't you believe me?

26:25.450 --> 26:31.372
My teacher, Mlle Dieu, was mad about
me. She'd have done anything for me.

26:36.495 --> 26:42.918
And I'm not stupid. Take arithmetic.
No one can count faster than me.

26:44.218 --> 26:47.100
I beat the supermarket till.

26:52.422 --> 26:58.225
Choose two numbers. Anything from
one to ten thousand. Hurry!

26:58.825 --> 27:03.307
Okay... 3547 + 8768

27:03.507 --> 27:06.108
12,315.

27:06.308 --> 27:07.309
Check it!

27:09.310 --> 27:11.511
You're right, wow!

27:12.511 --> 27:13.472
Another.

27:13.952 --> 27:16.193
No, I believe you.

27:18.914 --> 27:22.596
When I was small, I played that
with my father.

27:23.736 --> 27:29.239
He used to say "You can beat anyone
else on earth, no matter who".

27:29.879 --> 27:31.240
"No matter who".

27:41.485 --> 27:44.246
I mustn't drink any more.

27:50.649 --> 27:54.210
- What's got into you?
- Nothing.

27:54.410 --> 27:55.971
You were like it in the car.

27:56.972 --> 27:59.133
Don't take any notice.

28:02.174 --> 28:08.657
Generally, boys don't take so much
trouble to make me see...

28:17.341 --> 28:19.062
You know what I mean?

28:19.262 --> 28:23.064
Who are you talking about?
The chemist?

28:23.704 --> 28:27.986
Or that man on holiday,
or the Portuguese?

28:28.666 --> 28:29.827
It's not true.

28:30.507 --> 28:34.109
- You weren't there.
- Okay, so they lied.

28:35.429 --> 28:37.670
Did Massigne tell you that?

28:37.790 --> 28:39.431
- I said "then".
- They are stupid.

29:03.162 --> 29:07.284
I only meant that if you like me...

29:07.404 --> 29:09.805
you don't have to do all this.

29:10.045 --> 29:15.928
You can have me here
among the plates...

29:16.088 --> 29:18.089
in front of everybody!

29:19.730 --> 29:21.931
Would you like anything else?

29:22.091 --> 29:23.531
Leave us alone!

29:33.776 --> 29:34.776
Cheer up.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.181
9,322 and...

29:44.381 --> 29:46.062
7,825.

29:52.304 --> 29:53.505
17,147.

30:01.189 --> 30:06.791
<i>Well, two things she said were true
About the counting and the crying.</i>

30:24.519 --> 30:26.120
I told you, I'm tipsy.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.681
We'll go home.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.962
I want to stay with you.

30:35.204 --> 30:38.206
No need to wake the Holy Family.

30:39.366 --> 30:41.967
We can sleep in the barn.

30:42.327 --> 30:44.608
<i>Seeing her look at me like that...</i>

30:45.289 --> 30:47.790
<i>I made my biggest mistake ever.</i>

30:49.891 --> 30:51.292
Where are you?

30:59.615 --> 31:05.618
<i>What an idiot you look, Elle. If it
weren't so funny, I'd kill myself.</i>

31:05.778 --> 31:09.379
<i>He wants to get his pants down
and Elle just wants it over with...</i>

31:10.941 --> 31:12.901
<i>without her zip jamming.</i>

31:14.382 --> 31:16.423
<i>Let Elle forget for a moment...</i>

31:16.623 --> 31:18.824
<i>he's the son of his beastly father.</i>

31:20.205 --> 31:26.168
<i>I'll say, what are they doing
to you, Little Eliane?</i>

31:26.268 --> 31:28.108
<i>Let her enjoy it this once.</i>

32:21.093 --> 32:22.693
<i>A bit of patience and I'll find
them all.</i>

32:22.894 --> 32:25.095
<i>They'll pay dearly, and their families.</i>

32:48.585 --> 32:52.547
You could at least say where you've been.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.468
You know where I've been.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.831
For Christ's sake, don't just
stand there.

33:00.851 --> 33:06.473
What must I do to make you take
a swipe at me just once?

33:07.994 --> 33:10.035
Don't you understand?

33:10.996 --> 33:15.478
I want you to hit me. I'd prefer it
that way. Can't you see?

33:26.923 --> 33:30.404
<i>But she can't see, any more than
she ever has.</i>

33:30.444 --> 33:34.887
<i>She'll go on thinking about who I am
and what happened to us.</i>

33:36.287 --> 33:41.329
<i>I mustn't mention the barrel organ.</i>

33:41.830 --> 33:44.811
<i>I must do it all myself. She'd stop me.</i>

33:55.536 --> 33:56.576
Come on.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.818
To please me.

34:08.862 --> 34:09.822
Mother.

35:12.131 --> 35:14.212
Haven't you finished yet?

35:16.053 --> 35:18.414
You're disturbing the whole village.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.975
Wait till I get my hands on you.

35:22.736 --> 35:26.418
Why must they be so stupid?

35:26.898 --> 35:29.219
They're just having a joke.

35:34.821 --> 35:38.303
Yes, what does it matter?

35:59.513 --> 36:01.394
Sit down there.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.681
Something to say?

36:20.362 --> 36:22.043
What about you?

36:22.683 --> 36:24.204
What has she pinched?

36:24.764 --> 36:27.125
Nothing. These are my knickers.

36:27.806 --> 36:30.647
I hate wearing yesterday's clothes.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.209
This is my house.

36:34.369 --> 36:38.251
- Leave her alone.
- Is she going to stay?

36:39.371 --> 36:40.572
She's staying.

36:45.614 --> 36:48.655
I'm going to live with the Montecciaris.

36:58.420 --> 36:59.620
She's leaving?

37:02.622 --> 37:03.982
Good riddance.

37:10.465 --> 37:12.546
I love you best of all.

37:16.548 --> 37:17.669
No, you don't.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.050
I'm only down the village street.
It's not far.

37:26.993 --> 37:33.196
<i>Our trip back was a real joke. You'd
have thought we were April fools.</i>

37:34.236 --> 37:38.018
It must be deadly indoors to bring them
out like this.

37:39.799 --> 37:43.921
<i>Brochard and his wife were
the stupidest of all.</i>

37:44.081 --> 37:45.521
You're moving?

37:49.883 --> 37:52.485
What's it got to do with you?

37:53.725 --> 37:58.756
<i>You don't have to turn on the TV
to hear idiots talk.</i>

38:13.772 --> 38:15.580
- It's not very nice.
- But it's clean.

38:16.368 --> 38:17.075
I must go to work.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.985
- Can I put up my posters?
- It's your home.

38:32.307 --> 38:36.975
- Mind if I say something?
- No need, I'm not stupid.

38:39.009 --> 38:43.166
I didn't have time to put on pants.
I'll do it now.

38:44.474 --> 38:47.832
<i>His smile made me want to give up.</i>

38:56.355 --> 38:57.955
Not much room here.

39:01.972 --> 39:04.004
I had this bath when I was a baby.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.672
It's a good thing our water's free.

39:16.583 --> 39:18.979
She's going to bathe right here!

39:31.668 --> 39:33.155
I have to admit!

39:33.988 --> 39:34.781
What?

39:39.199 --> 39:43.257
- I've my own upstairs.
- Either way, I'll be doing the washing.

39:44.918 --> 39:50.259
Your mother didn't teach you much
to go by your hands.

39:50.379 --> 39:55.661
My mother wouldn't like you speaking
to me like that. She'd say your son...

39:55.781 --> 39:57.382
shouldn't have fetched me.

39:57.542 --> 40:00.143
It won't last long.

40:03.064 --> 40:04.945
Hey, Broken Hi-fi!

40:07.627 --> 40:08.947
Listen to this.

40:09.387 --> 40:14.750
Before he's rid of me, your sister will
have bought me a wedding dress.

40:15.070 --> 40:17.951
I'm sorry, I'm hard of hearing.

40:23.554 --> 40:28.116
<i>Smothered in lace. And I'll see she
cries all over it.</i>

40:33.078 --> 40:36.720
I'm taking eggs to your mother
any message?

40:59.810 --> 41:04.593
<i>In the Ice Mother's bedroom was
a bed that could kill.</i>

41:06.093 --> 41:07.294
<i>And his photograph.</i>

41:10.495 --> 41:13.097
<i>How did I stop myself spitting on it?</i>

41:21.580 --> 41:24.382
You look like a monkey when you eat.

41:26.062 --> 41:30.144
Fancy being so old, greedy,
and ugly too.

41:30.264 --> 41:33.706
I'd rather die at thirty, or maybe forty.

41:33.746 --> 41:35.627
Your turn, stupid!

41:42.670 --> 41:45.471
- You counted my winnings?
- No bloody fear!

41:45.511 --> 41:47.912
You're a good girl.

41:48.153 --> 41:53.875
We're already good friends. I've a
soft spot for old people.

41:57.197 --> 41:59.598
Two and twenty, Our Sorrowful Lady.

42:08.962 --> 42:10.483
You left these behind.

42:11.363 --> 42:15.645
I wondered why you stuck your nose
in things.

42:16.766 --> 42:18.807
I'm going up to change.

42:19.727 --> 42:23.489
<i>She said nothing about her visit
but it doesn't matter.</i>

42:24.649 --> 42:28.131
<i>My mother would never talk to
strangers.</i>

42:30.012 --> 42:31.893
You can dry the salad.

42:32.013 --> 42:33.934
I don't know how.

42:38.376 --> 42:41.937
Has that barrel organ always belonged
to you?

42:42.778 --> 42:48.500
My husband brought it here when he
was young. On foot, if you must know.

42:48.620 --> 42:49.581
On foot!

42:50.621 --> 42:52.862
It was his living.

42:55.543 --> 42:56.944
Why do you ask?

42:57.224 --> 43:01.666
I thought I'd seen it when I was small
in Arrame.

43:02.787 --> 43:05.028
It's never gone that far.

43:06.148 --> 43:09.590
The last time it left here
you weren't even born.

43:40.044 --> 43:40.764
What's the matter?

43:41.485 --> 43:43.886
Nothing. It's all right.

43:47.487 --> 43:49.328
Turn that thing off!

43:52.169 --> 43:54.731
It's nothing. I'll soon be better.

43:58.332 --> 43:59.653
Don't say anything.

44:00.973 --> 44:01.934
Promise?

44:08.737 --> 44:09.858
Who did that?

44:12.819 --> 44:15.500
Your aunt with the cheese grater.

44:17.181 --> 44:19.182
What made you do that?

44:22.143 --> 44:24.144
What's he saying?

44:24.344 --> 44:27.025
Tell him it's not true, you hussy!

44:27.186 --> 44:31.053
- Stop that. She never insulted you.
- Steady on.

44:31.147 --> 44:32.148
You agree?

44:32.428 --> 44:33.949
No, I don't.

44:34.069 --> 44:36.510
- What's going on?
- Hang on.

44:39.191 --> 44:40.712
I was joking.

44:42.192 --> 44:45.274
It's hardly your aunt's style, is it?

44:47.275 --> 44:48.955
What did she say?

44:49.076 --> 44:50.036
Nothing.

44:55.679 --> 44:57.479
Aren't you ashamed?

44:57.599 --> 45:00.201
Fancy imagining that of your aunt.

45:01.801 --> 45:04.202
It's always the same.

45:04.843 --> 45:08.324
I felt faint and fell.

45:10.685 --> 45:13.487
Faint? How do you mean?

45:14.767 --> 45:18.129
I was in the barn. Bou-Bou found me.

45:22.771 --> 45:24.892
Has this happened often? '

45:24.972 --> 45:25.972
Never.

45:30.374 --> 45:36.257
You spend all day reading stupid
magazines. No wonder you feel ill.

45:41.019 --> 45:42.420
No it's not that.

45:45.822 --> 45:52.024
<i>I let a few weeks pass and am as sweet
as pie with everyone.</i>

45:52.305 --> 45:57.327
Can't you rest a bit? Anyone would
think you were the maid here.

46:00.228 --> 46:04.310
<i>In the afternoons while I wait for
Pin-Pon I play patience.</i>

46:04.550 --> 46:09.312
<i>I change dresses, fix my false nails,
varnish them...</i>

46:09.392 --> 46:14.595
<i>or lose myself in thoughts of that
other old fool.</i>

46:19.597 --> 46:21.998
You've won again, my pet.

46:26.760 --> 46:31.282
<i>After an hour or so dreaming
like that...</i>

46:31.402 --> 46:33.643
<i>I'm so fed up I have to go out.</i>

46:49.131 --> 46:53.172
<i>On Sunday mornings, Mickey sets off
for a race saying...</i>

46:53.332 --> 46:54.653
I'll win, dammit!

46:59.575 --> 47:00.896
<i>And returns, saying:</i>

47:01.536 --> 47:03.657
I lost, dammit!

47:03.777 --> 47:05.298
Hardly surprising.

47:05.538 --> 47:09.740
It's your fault too. You service
the bike.

47:10.780 --> 47:15.863
However well I ride, the bike's so heavy
I always beat it past the post.

47:16.463 --> 47:18.944
- Where's Mother?
- Outside.

47:19.044 --> 47:21.105
Then listen to me.

47:21.265 --> 47:23.586
Your bike doesn't drink or smoke.

47:25.227 --> 47:28.469
Or spend every night with Georgette

47:31.510 --> 47:33.551
How can you hope to win?

47:37.833 --> 47:39.274
Is this large?

47:39.434 --> 47:41.755
- Read the ticket.
- I cant read.

47:42.595 --> 47:45.076
Ninety-seven francs fifty.

47:47.277 --> 47:51.559
- You counted that fast.
- My looks apart, that's all God gave me.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.561
What are you knitting?

47:54.681 --> 47:56.561
What do you think?

48:02.284 --> 48:04.525
How do you know?

48:04.685 --> 48:09.728
I went to the doctor. He said
I cant know yet but I’m sure.

48:10.248 --> 48:15.090
I'm sure she is. She's tricked you,
my poor boy.

48:15.290 --> 48:20.092
Be quiet. No one's tricked anyone.
It's one of those things.

48:26.695 --> 48:32.698
Anyway I hate people whispering about
her. We'll deal with this fast.

48:33.378 --> 48:39.821
<i>End of chapter. A little perseverance
and I'll sign my name Montecciari.</i>

48:40.101 --> 48:42.382
Look, I've some work for you.

48:42.623 --> 48:46.104
Josette, Henry IV's wife, gave it to me.

48:46.304 --> 48:48.986
You're really going to be married?

48:49.106 --> 48:52.107
I knew it. I prayed in church.

48:54.468 --> 48:58.350
It's beautiful. Worth a lot of money.

48:58.790 --> 49:04.593
Make it tight, with lots of lace
and trimmings, like a Marilyn dress.

49:07.474 --> 49:10.435
He looks such a kind boy.

49:11.276 --> 49:15.438
So serious and such a good worker.

49:15.598 --> 49:16.798
And so handsome too.

49:17.198 --> 49:20.000
Yes, Italians aren't bad.

49:21.841 --> 49:23.161
Describe yours.

49:24.842 --> 49:27.708
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes you do.

49:29.564 --> 49:33.566
Tall. Dark. With a black moustache.

49:35.567 --> 49:36.607
What else?

49:39.889 --> 49:41.890
Come on, tell me.

50:10.903 --> 50:15.025
<i>What more can I say than I've said
hundred times before...</i>

50:15.065 --> 50:18.767
<i>when you've badgered me
with your questions?</i>

50:19.987 --> 50:21.828
<i>It was November, 1955.</i>

50:23.429 --> 50:28.151
<i>A Saturday, in the middle of
the day.</i>

50:28.271 --> 50:31.472
<i>There were three of them. One was
Italian.</i>

50:31.593 --> 50:37.035
<i>There was a fork before Arrame and
sometimes motorists missed the road.</i>

50:37.435 --> 50:39.820
<i>Otherwise no-one came our way.</i>

50:40.917 --> 50:44.158
We've lost our way. Is Arrame far?

50:44.398 --> 50:46.099
Go back to the fork.

50:46.439 --> 50:48.760
Take the road along by the river.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.401
That's a fine rabbit.

50:52.762 --> 50:55.003
It's nice and quiet here.

51:00.246 --> 51:01.646
<i>I was alone.</i>

51:03.367 --> 51:06.849
<i>Every other Saturday, Gabriel visited
his sister.</i>

51:07.529 --> 51:11.091
<i>But she refused to see me.</i>

51:13.692 --> 51:19.775
<i>I was shy then. More so than now,
but not easily scared.</i>

51:19.935 --> 51:24.297
<i>I'd had that knocked out of me
in the war.</i>

51:26.017 --> 51:29.019
<i>But I was on edge all day...</i>

51:30.540 --> 51:34.581
<i>as if something inside me knew
they'd be back.</i>

51:36.622 --> 51:41.625
<i>When they come, I thought
"No, it's not true".</i>

51:42.545 --> 51:44.946
<i>But I knew it was true. That was my life!</i>

54:39.266 --> 54:41.707
Here are your clean clothes.

54:42.187 --> 54:44.909
Shall I cook carrots or courgettes?

54:46.269 --> 54:50.471
<i>My sister is a nitwit. A good woman
but a nitwit.</i>

54:51.192 --> 54:54.733
<i>She shouts though she knows
I can't hear.</i>

54:54.953 --> 54:59.315
<i>The child doesn't shout. She speaks
slowly so I understand.</i>

55:00.196 --> 55:04.238
What was your brother-in-law like?

55:04.358 --> 55:05.478
Poor Lello?

55:06.639 --> 55:07.999
Irritable.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.161
But kind hearted.

55:13.282 --> 55:15.323
A real Italian.

55:18.724 --> 55:22.446
<i>She gets on well with Mickey and
especially Bou-Bou.</i>

55:22.686 --> 55:27.448
<i>I'm sure she bought him that sweater
he wore last Sunday.</i>

55:28.729 --> 55:33.011
<i>She said nothing to the others but
I don't miss much.</i>

55:35.132 --> 55:37.173
I'll win, dammit!

55:44.896 --> 55:50.899
<i>Only my sister dislikes her. She
thinks her insincere and giddy.</i>

55:51.859 --> 55:53.060
She's a bad lot.

55:54.140 --> 55:56.161
The child is unhappy.

55:58.602 --> 56:00.563
Life can't have been easy.

56:01.163 --> 56:04.385
But she'd rather show her bottom
than her true feelings.

56:04.785 --> 56:08.195
You were so stuck up as a girl.

56:08.730 --> 56:10.067
And guess what she calls you.

56:10.147 --> 56:15.190
I know "Broken Hi-fi"
She told me.

56:18.992 --> 56:25.013
Did she ask you who brought the barrel
organ back after Lello pawned it?

56:25.248 --> 56:26.235
I can't hear.

56:26.315 --> 56:31.677
She asked who brought
the barrel organ back.

56:32.078 --> 56:33.158
I cant hear.

56:33.278 --> 56:34.879
<i>I remember who it was.</i>

56:34.919 --> 56:37.120
<i>Lebalech and his brother-in-law.</i>

56:37.240 --> 56:39.561
You weren't there when they came.

56:39.761 --> 56:42.963
It was the day the tractor crushed
Massigne.

56:43.163 --> 56:46.124
You'd gone to the wake. So there!

56:51.607 --> 56:57.289
<i>Leballech and his brother-in-law.
That was fifty-five or fifty-six.</i>

56:57.609 --> 57:01.531
<i>No, fifty-five. In November.</i>

57:06.694 --> 57:10.415
<i>The men had a drink together,
here in the kitchen.</i>

57:10.615 --> 57:15.498
<i>Florimond was just a boy then,
always at his father's side.</i>

57:15.578 --> 57:21.840
<i>I knew Leballech by sight. He drove
for Ferrold's like Mickey does now.</i>

57:22.621 --> 57:28.924
<i>I didn't know the brother-in-law.
He said he was from Digne.</i>

57:28.944 --> 57:33.426
<i>I was worried that the boy wasn't
in bed. It was past midnight.</i>

57:35.947 --> 57:39.509
<i>Strange how clearly I remember
that time...</i>

57:39.709 --> 57:44.011
<i>but not those marvellous days
with my husband before the war.</i>

57:45.511 --> 57:49.813
<i>In the summer we rented a cottage
at Susset-les-Pins.</i>

57:51.034 --> 57:53.815
<i>The garden was full of oleanders.</i>

57:53.875 --> 57:59.758
<i>I remember the gramophone and my
favourite record "The Barge Sails On".</i>

58:00.959 --> 58:05.000
<i>"Thinking of nothing the current
runs on...</i>

58:06.641 --> 58:09.823
<i>making wanderers of us all"</i>

58:23.649 --> 58:25.570
<i>I don't remember the singer.</i>

58:25.730 --> 58:27.851
<i>Yes, I do Lys Gauy.</i>

58:29.211 --> 58:31.513
<i>I don't remember the gramophone.</i>

58:32.533 --> 58:35.067
<i>But there was a dog on the label.</i>

58:35.454 --> 58:37.655
<i>It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

58:40.217 --> 58:43.418
<i>Oh God, I can't remember the make.</i>

58:43.938 --> 58:45.019
His Master's Voice.

58:45.139 --> 58:49.141
The dog is His Master's Voice. Everyone
knows that.

58:50.781 --> 58:52.462
You're going daft.

58:52.862 --> 58:53.902
You're wicked!

58:54.823 --> 58:56.784
Yes, you're very wicked.

59:04.228 --> 59:10.530
I love you best in this house but
you're losing your memory.

59:11.391 --> 59:13.592
Don't let them know.

59:16.673 --> 59:17.593
Ask me.

59:23.496 --> 59:27.958
I'm not wicked. I'm going daft too.

59:30.219 --> 59:31.340
You understand?

59:41.325 --> 59:46.607
<i>That afternoon she went to town to get
her birth certificate for the wedding.</i>

59:48.568 --> 59:51.269
<i>When she came back, she'd changed.</i>

59:51.409 --> 59:56.732
<i>Her eyes weren't made up any more.
She was sad.</i>

59:57.252 --> 59:58.452
<i>Worse than that.</i>

59:59.373 --> 01:00:02.414
Can I see your birth certificate?

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.195
Mind your own bloody business!

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:09.097
Coming for a swim?

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.021
Let me see it. Be a good girl.

01:00:21.783 --> 01:00:26.305
<i>She was born on the tenth of July,
nineteen fifty-six.</i>

01:00:26.425 --> 01:00:28.692
<i>She'd be twenty in few days.</i>

01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:34.021
<i>Her name was Eliane Manuela Herta
Wieck.</i>

01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:40.392
<i>Her mother, Paula Manuela Wieck
was a naturalised French citizen.</i>

01:00:41.592 --> 01:00:43.953
<i>Her father was unknown.</i>

01:00:46.114 --> 01:00:47.835
You've your mother's name.

01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:49.355
Do you mind?

01:00:49.516 --> 01:00:50.716
Just explain.

01:00:52.397 --> 01:00:54.398
There's nothing to explain.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:59.340
Don't go away. I'm on your side.

01:01:03.362 --> 01:01:08.645
<i>I had to wait two or three days to
be alone with her again.</i>

01:01:09.085 --> 01:01:13.167
<i>Curiosity gets worse with age.</i>

01:01:13.287 --> 01:01:17.168
I want to speak to you. Come here

01:01:17.649 --> 01:01:22.851
She was off to see her old teacher,
Mlle Dieu on the bus.

01:01:28.534 --> 01:01:33.096
<i>I know she'll tell me to leave
her hair alone.</i>

01:01:33.216 --> 01:01:36.097
I won't mess up your hair.

01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:39.339
All right, you won't mess it up.

01:01:40.859 --> 01:01:43.340
What did you want to say?

01:01:44.461 --> 01:01:46.662
Want to know about that organ?

01:01:48.063 --> 01:01:51.424
Delivered eight months before
you were born.

01:01:51.504 --> 01:01:55.946
I'm not as stupid as you imagine.
I've plenty of time to think.

01:01:57.707 --> 01:01:59.588
Go on, ask me.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:09.032
Ask what? Who brought the organ back?
I couldn't care less.

01:02:09.152 --> 01:02:13.394
No use asking my sister. She wasn't
there.

01:02:13.554 --> 01:02:17.516
But I was. Nobody else but me
can tell you.

01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:23.599
I don't want to know.

01:02:24.159 --> 01:02:28.281
I want to marry Pin-Pon. That's all!

01:02:35.124 --> 01:02:36.325
Silly ass.

01:02:44.408 --> 01:02:46.109
I know you're there.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.171
His name is Leballech.

01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:54.533
He was with his brother-in-law.
Do you hear me?

01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:08.620
He drove a lorry for Ferraldo,
Mickey's boss

01:03:11.861 --> 01:03:16.543
When you see Pin-Pon, tell him I'm
having supper with my teacher.

01:03:17.763 --> 01:03:19.017
I'll tell him.

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:28.349
Leballech left to go and work for
himself.

01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:32.711
He has a sawmill on the Coustelet
road.

01:03:32.871 --> 01:03:36.512
- And his brother-in-law?
- Name of Touret.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:38.693
Works in Carpentras.

01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:42.995
Your father sent you?

01:03:43.435 --> 01:03:44.536
He can't move.

01:03:46.117 --> 01:03:47.838
He knew Leballech?

01:03:49.438 --> 01:03:55.401
It's odd. The Holy Family - I mean my
future mother-in-law - knew him.

01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:58.923
He brought back their barrel organ once.

01:03:59.963 --> 01:04:01.004
You remember?

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.845
November fifty-five.

01:04:06.606 --> 01:04:09.968
There we are Saturday the nineteenth
Leballech.

01:04:10.528 --> 01:04:15.290
Timber for Bonnet, fencing for Poncet,
Arrame.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.731
Barrel organ, Montecciari.

01:04:19.212 --> 01:04:20.252
And below...

01:04:20.452 --> 01:04:24.094
lorry out all night. Leballech warned.

01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:34.659
<i>There were so many cars in Carpentras
and I'd such a headache.</i>

01:04:45.624 --> 01:04:46.664
Can I help?

01:04:47.785 --> 01:04:48.745
M. Touret?

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:53.067
He's out with a client but he shouldn't
be long.

01:04:53.548 --> 01:04:57.349
I've been transferred from Nice I'm
a teacher.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:00.751
I need a furnished flat. Nothing too
dear.

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:05.873
This is just the thing Rue de L'Hubac,
fourth floor.

01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:13.517
- This young lady wants a flat.
- Thank you, Suzy.

01:05:16.998 --> 01:05:20.200
<i>I wish he were dead and rotting
already.</i>

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.121
It's fine. Just what I want.

01:05:25.402 --> 01:05:29.684
But eight hundred francs a month is
an awful lot.

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:34.226
<i>If this were the cinema not an eye
would be dry.</i>

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:40.609
I'm sorry but I can't make up my mind.
Tonight I'll think it over.

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.570
But of course.

01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:45.652
Ring when you've decided.

01:05:46.412 --> 01:05:49.893
Then we can meet again.

01:05:59.157 --> 01:06:01.058
- Dad's in his office
- Thanks

01:06:01.659 --> 01:06:06.141
<i>Laugh while you've still the chance.</i>

01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:16.065
Sorry to bother you, but I may rent
a flat from your brother-in-law.

01:06:17.426 --> 01:06:18.627
I'm a teacher.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:30.752
How much would you charge for
a bookcase?

01:06:30.952 --> 01:06:33.954
Just shelves for my books.

01:06:34.114 --> 01:06:39.636
I'm not a carpenter. I could maybe let
you have some wood but that's all.

01:06:40.957 --> 01:06:42.438
I'll give you a name.

01:06:45.199 --> 01:06:48.680
Say I sent you and they won't rook you.

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:54.563
I may not take the flat after all.
It's really too dear for me.

01:06:54.683 --> 01:06:59.085
Do you know how much a teacher
earns? Less than nothing.

01:06:59.205 --> 01:07:02.127
Try bargaining with him.

01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:07.049
I know where that would get me.
I'm not stupid.

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:10.891
He undresses you with a glance.

01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:13.772
Have I offended you?

01:07:14.212 --> 01:07:19.595
The less I hear of my brother-in-law,
the better pleased I am.

01:07:28.179 --> 01:07:32.260
- How old are you?
- Twenty. My name is Jeanne.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.421
And you're a teacher?

01:07:34.862 --> 01:07:37.103
Make my shelves and you'll see.

01:07:42.606 --> 01:07:45.667
- See you.
- I hope so.

01:07:48.868 --> 01:07:53.430
<i>If he's still standing there when
I turn round, he's had it.</i>

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:57.072
<i>As sure as I'm alive I'll have
his soul.</i>

01:08:02.154 --> 01:08:04.555
<i>My teacher had been waiting an age.</i>

01:08:07.236 --> 01:08:10.738
<i>A budgie-fancier would have
put her in a cage.</i>

01:08:10.998 --> 01:08:15.120
Well, we are all dressed up!

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.841
Why did you keep me hanging about?

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:24.044
Did you dress up for me?
It's quite amazing.

01:08:24.144 --> 01:08:26.925
Let's go I'm hungry.

01:08:28.326 --> 01:08:30.327
How much does a teacher earn?

01:08:30.487 --> 01:08:32.568
Enough to buy you a present.

01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:35.009
That's not why I asked.

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:37.630
Do I look like a teacher?

01:08:40.732 --> 01:08:42.733
You look like no one else.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:48.335
Do you remember I once had tests
done in Nice?

01:08:49.256 --> 01:08:51.937
A bloody counsellor typed a report...

01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:57.459
saying I was unfeeling, antisocial
and perverse. Do you think that's true?

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.981
No, I wrote and said so.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:04.582
I am not unfeeling. And you've done
worse than that.

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:10.064
On my certificate last week, you wrote
'father unknown".

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:14.307
You're the village clerk, you could
easily...

01:09:14.426 --> 01:09:17.788
have written Gabriel Devigne,
couldn't you?

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:20.790
For me!

01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:31.795
You know what you are? An idiot.

01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:37.078
Calm down.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.362
What about your napkin?

01:10:00.808 --> 01:10:03.090
But I never smoke.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:05.411
Except to annoy.

01:10:10.493 --> 01:10:12.214
But it's very pretty.

01:10:14.175 --> 01:10:16.416
There's a card in the box.

01:10:17.456 --> 01:10:18.417
Leave it.

01:10:21.938 --> 01:10:23.939
'Let me be your flame".

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.901
Terribly trite but I found it touching
too.

01:10:32.183 --> 01:10:35.464
I'll give you a better kiss in the car
later.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.465
I love seeing her blush.

01:10:40.587 --> 01:10:43.308
- What are you thinking about?
- You.

01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:45.589
What's so funny about me?

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:51.752
You put a bra on under your blouse.

01:10:53.433 --> 01:10:55.634
I'd see you didn't at home.

01:10:57.595 --> 01:11:00.556
Give me a birthday treat.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.757
Go and take it off in the toilet.

01:11:04.037 --> 01:11:06.719
Don't be crazy. People will see.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.560
Please.

01:11:19.965 --> 01:11:23.006
I warn you I’m going to do it.

01:12:13.389 --> 01:12:14.510
I did it.

01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:20.793
Next time, show your behind.

01:12:23.314 --> 01:12:28.416
I always repay what I owe, for good
or ill. Then I'm quits.

01:12:30.557 --> 01:12:32.598
She kissed amazingly well.

01:12:58.730 --> 01:12:59.931
Are you angry?

01:13:03.852 --> 01:13:07.574
I rang Mlle Dieu at seven.
She wasn't in.

01:13:07.854 --> 01:13:11.056
She took me out for my birthday.

01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:13.217
She gave me a lighter.

01:13:16.218 --> 01:13:18.299
She did you proud.

01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:30.264
- Is that yours?
- My father's.

01:13:31.905 --> 01:13:33.546
Are you a good shot?

01:13:33.586 --> 01:13:34.787
He was better.

01:13:35.427 --> 01:13:39.008
Would you use it if someone hurt me?

01:13:39.029 --> 01:13:41.069
Who'd want to do that?

01:13:45.752 --> 01:13:46.912
I don't know.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:55.316
<i>He's very quiet up there.
Maybe he seeps all day.</i>

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:59.718
<i>Or he's not shouting at me
because I'm twenty.</i>

01:14:06.201 --> 01:14:10.583
Mother, I want to ask you something.
Don't be cross.

01:14:10.683 --> 01:14:12.804
Am I generally cross?

01:14:16.126 --> 01:14:19.407
How was he when you knew him
in Germany?

01:14:20.968 --> 01:14:25.570
He was lost. He was hungry,
like we all were.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:29.652
We were fleeing. What do you want
me to say?

01:14:29.772 --> 01:14:32.413
I don't know just what he was like.

01:14:32.773 --> 01:14:35.494
You saw at once he was French.

01:14:35.614 --> 01:14:40.537
He looked as if he'd been punished
for something he hadn't done.

01:14:46.059 --> 01:14:48.820
Lower, so the best man can take it off.

01:14:48.981 --> 01:14:51.022
That'll amuse Mickey.

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:52.942
And later?

01:14:58.385 --> 01:15:00.506
November fifty-five.

01:15:00.826 --> 01:15:04.268
When he came back from visiting
his beastly sister.

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:07.029
What did he do?

01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:09.470
I knew you'd get back to that.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:13.752
I warn you I'll break everything.
Windows, crockery the lot.

01:15:13.912 --> 01:15:18.114
- I've told you a hundred times.
- Make it a hundred and one.

01:15:18.234 --> 01:15:21.235
Why didn't he go to the police?

01:15:21.555 --> 01:15:22.756
I stopped him.

01:15:23.636 --> 01:15:26.478
You didn't recognise any of them?

01:15:26.638 --> 01:15:29.919
No, they weren't from round here.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.962
Do nothing. Don't tell anyone.

01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:38.923
I'm a foreigner.

01:15:39.084 --> 01:15:41.685
They'll laugh at you.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:48.088
I'll find them myself.

01:15:48.728 --> 01:15:50.489
Kill them with my own hands.

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:54.130
But I knew he wouldn't.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:58.773
He was a mouse of a man.
And miserly with it.

01:16:00.573 --> 01:16:02.294
He was always good to me.

01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:06.656
Yes, that's true. He was different
with you.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.057
Leave the dress alone.

01:16:09.177 --> 01:16:13.299
The truth is you didn't love him.
So he didn't care.

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:20.382
If it turns out you were having it off
behind his back...

01:16:22.343 --> 01:16:25.545
I've never looked at another man.

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:28.986
Ask him, if you don't believe me.

01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:33.569
But you're right. I didn't love him
enough.

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.870
Not to sacrifice everything.

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:42.152
We'll have to find a midwife who'll
do it. I'll ask my sister.

01:16:44.353 --> 01:16:49.716
I agree with the doctor. Whoever
made it, the child is mine.

01:16:53.117 --> 01:16:55.158
If you want, I'll go away.

01:17:05.203 --> 01:17:10.045
Listen, Gabriel even the man himself
doesn't know.

01:17:10.245 --> 01:17:12.806
For us, it's as if he's dead.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:14.167
Dead!

01:17:14.207 --> 01:17:16.608
Would I be taking like this
if he were dead?

01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:20.150
But all three are alive and kicking.

01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:24.712
And all I seem to be good for is
cleaning up the mess they made.

01:17:26.653 --> 01:17:31.255
Do as you like, but I'll never accept
the child as mine.

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.577
You should have left me where I was.

01:17:36.457 --> 01:17:38.258
I didn't ask to be born.

01:17:40.419 --> 01:17:42.900
And he'd still be walking.

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:54.466
Sure you're not too hot like that?

01:17:54.626 --> 01:17:57.067
What would you suggest? Armour?

01:17:57.467 --> 01:18:01.669
<i>As usual, I got over it. I had a bit
of a headache, that's all.</i>

01:18:06.911 --> 01:18:08.912
Climb on my back.

01:18:12.034 --> 01:18:14.195
I know where to find some trout.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:20.777
As Cognata said, they were good times.
I didn't know they were 'before'.

01:18:22.238 --> 01:18:25.040
How I wish it was now.

01:18:31.122 --> 01:18:34.404
What do you say to some glasses?

01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:37.205
Won't that be nice?

01:19:01.656 --> 01:19:04.858
That's rubbish, just for the Social
Security.

01:19:05.058 --> 01:19:06.218
I'll explain.

01:19:06.819 --> 01:19:08.940
It's because of the war.

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.381
Mummy was German.

01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:15.303
But that it makes no difference to us.

01:19:15.423 --> 01:19:16.623
You understand?

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:45.156
<i>When I've done it, I'll go and say...</i>

01:19:45.276 --> 01:19:48.918
<i>"Dad, they're dead. We'll both get
better now".</i>

01:19:54.281 --> 01:19:56.201
<i>I mustn't stay here.</i>

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:05.045
<i>These shoe's are hopeless. Damn!</i>

01:20:11.048 --> 01:20:12.969
<i>He was always my dad.</i>

01:20:13.169 --> 01:20:16.891
<i>He didn't touch me. It was me that
saw evil everywhere.</i>

01:20:22.533 --> 01:20:25.415
Be careful, you'll have your hand off!

01:20:26.535 --> 01:20:27.736
That was a big one.

01:20:28.936 --> 01:20:31.097
Come down, that's enough now.

01:20:31.337 --> 01:20:32.498
What a girl.

01:20:33.739 --> 01:20:34.939
I could eat you.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:39.701
What is it?

01:20:41.822 --> 01:20:44.063
Don't touch me...

01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:12.356
<i>His silence proves he thought of me
as his daughter.</i>

01:21:12.476 --> 01:21:15.478
<i>"He'd fallen from a tree". Full stop.</i>

01:21:15.598 --> 01:21:20.440
<i>The doctor might not have believed it
but no one could budge him.</i>

01:21:37.608 --> 01:21:41.089
It took me three bends to catch up
with you.

01:21:43.451 --> 01:21:47.733
I'm racing at Manosque tomorrow.
I'll come in last.

01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:50.974
Unless I add a motor.

01:21:58.898 --> 01:22:01.139
How many kilometres today?

01:22:01.259 --> 01:22:03.980
I'll tell Pin-Pon a hundred.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.141
But really it was fifty.

01:22:06.261 --> 01:22:09.342
And I drank three cans of beer.

01:22:12.264 --> 01:22:14.305
Got any cigarettes?

01:22:17.426 --> 01:22:19.907
Pin-Pon says I'm a daft brush.

01:22:20.748 --> 01:22:23.389
You're all as bad as each other.

01:22:28.631 --> 01:22:30.712
A first-class brush.

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:46.439
What are you thinking about?

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.241
There's one race I can win.

01:22:51.322 --> 01:22:53.403
It's in Carpentras in July.

01:22:53.763 --> 01:22:56.064
The week after your wedding.

01:22:57.124 --> 01:22:58.165
At Carpentras?

01:22:58.805 --> 01:23:02.287
Three tours of the town with a bonus
each time.

01:23:03.207 --> 01:23:04.568
What's the prize?

01:23:07.369 --> 01:23:11.571
A medal and a bike Pin-Pon will flog
for fifty francs.

01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:15.933
Oh, I'd like you to win.

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:22.176
<i>There we were not saying a word...</i>

01:23:22.296 --> 01:23:27.878
<i>and for no reason I began glooming
about Pin-Pon, Bou-Bou and Cognata.</i>

01:23:29.499 --> 01:23:31.740
Sunsets are such sad things.

01:23:44.826 --> 01:23:46.187
Look who's coming!

01:24:27.686 --> 01:24:30.087
<i>Three little notes of music.</i>

01:24:30.247 --> 01:24:31.448
<i>Locked in the attic...</i>

01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:34.289
<i>in the house of souvenirs.</i>

01:24:35.649 --> 01:24:41.732
<i>But they never cease to play,
turn the page though you may.</i>

01:24:44.173 --> 01:24:48.215
<i>Then one day without warning...</i>

01:24:48.335 --> 01:24:52.297
<i>you find they are calling.</i>

01:24:52.457 --> 01:24:55.459
<i>You'd prefer to forget...</i>

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.901
<i>their notes of regret...</i>

01:25:02.902 --> 01:25:05.903
<i>from that summer you met.</i>

01:25:08.465 --> 01:25:11.626
<i>But you will never forget...</i>

01:25:15.108 --> 01:25:18.149
<i>the notes that you heard...</i>

01:25:19.269 --> 01:25:21.310
<i>and the girl that you met.</i>

01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:08.492
Where's the best man?

01:26:36.185 --> 01:26:37.385
Who'd have thought it?

01:26:40.387 --> 01:26:42.187
That wasn't very manly.

01:26:44.509 --> 01:26:46.509
It's a wonderful day.

01:26:52.032 --> 01:26:58.075
<i>The sun, the music, everyone laughing,
it was all wonderful.</i>

01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:05.198
<i>I started laughing to myself. To think
it was my wedding. I was married.</i>

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:08.800
<i>Nothing around me seemed real.</i>

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.002
<i>Not even the home I'd always known.</i>

01:27:45.456 --> 01:27:47.457
I'll get you another.

01:27:57.582 --> 01:28:01.464
<i>It was then I started looking for Elle.</i>

01:28:01.584 --> 01:28:04.065
<i>But nobody knew where she was.</i>

01:28:05.226 --> 01:28:06.426
Have you seen Elle?

01:28:06.466 --> 01:28:08.587
She was in the house just now.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.872
I've already lost my wife.

01:28:45.604 --> 01:28:48.445
- Mickey, are you there?
- No, go away.

01:28:48.605 --> 01:28:52.567
<i>There was Mickey with Georgette
losing his next race</i>

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:55.369
Have you seen your daughter?

01:28:55.689 --> 01:28:57.329
She's not with you?

01:29:00.891 --> 01:29:02.892
Is something wrong?

01:29:09.895 --> 01:29:12.376
- Are you looking for Eliane?
- Have you seen her?

01:29:14.137 --> 01:29:18.139
<i>I disliked Eliane's teacher on sight
don't ask me why.</i>

01:29:18.299 --> 01:29:20.780
<i>There's no point explaining now.</i>

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.502
<i>What happened was as much my fault
as hers.</i>

01:29:30.705 --> 01:29:33.746
This is a wedding, not a funeral.

01:29:33.866 --> 01:29:36.627
Plenty of time later for regrets.

01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:42.670
Where's the bride?

01:29:43.391 --> 01:29:44.911
Gone in to rest.

01:29:49.393 --> 01:29:52.955
<i>I danced and forced myself
to join in the fun.</i>

01:29:53.155 --> 01:29:55.356
<i>At seven, she still wasn't back.</i>

01:29:55.476 --> 01:29:59.398
<i>Mickey and I went to look for her
in the village.</i>

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.481
Brochard, have you seen Elle?

01:30:06.581 --> 01:30:09.182
I last saw her coming out of church
on your arm.

01:30:09.282 --> 01:30:11.003
And very nice you looked.

01:30:11.163 --> 01:30:14.205
Let's try her mother's. It costs nothing
to look.

01:30:14.605 --> 01:30:18.687
<i>A nurse was looking after M. Devigne.</i>

01:30:19.527 --> 01:30:21.528
I've a good reputation.

01:30:23.529 --> 01:30:24.649
What happened?

01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:27.291
She wanted to see her father.

01:30:27.571 --> 01:30:31.613
But he didn't want to see her.
He was shouting like a madman.

01:30:32.773 --> 01:30:35.614
But she went up all the same.

01:30:37.976 --> 01:30:39.296
Don't look at me!

01:30:40.497 --> 01:30:42.538
Please, please.

01:30:42.898 --> 01:30:45.539
I did nothing. I meant no harm.

01:30:46.139 --> 01:30:48.781
Let go of me, you old whore!

01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:11.071
<i>They stayed like that a long time.</i>

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:20.315
Go along, Eliane, and find your mother.

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.396
I want your mother.

01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:54.651
You'll see.

01:31:57.372 --> 01:32:00.413
For both of us it'll be like before.

01:32:05.376 --> 01:32:06.576
I'm sure it will.

01:32:19.542 --> 01:32:24.825
You shouldn't believe everything women
say. They always exaggerate.

01:32:25.865 --> 01:32:27.746
He must be crazy.

01:32:27.946 --> 01:32:30.187
Shut up in his room all day.

01:32:32.228 --> 01:32:36.670
She moved in with you, so he decided
never to see her again.

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:39.431
Imagine how you'd feel.

01:32:42.513 --> 01:32:44.674
Is that all you can say?

01:32:46.074 --> 01:32:49.796
Don't you want to win at Carpentras?

01:32:51.877 --> 01:32:57.760
She's hiding somewhere. You know what
she's like, she's only a kid.

01:33:03.962 --> 01:33:05.363
Maybe she's back.

01:33:07.964 --> 01:33:13.367
Don't be angry with her.
It's not her fault.

01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:28.574
<i>I had a lump in my throat, like I had
as a boy when I wanted to howl.</i>

01:33:33.376 --> 01:33:35.377
We still have to eat.

01:33:54.746 --> 01:33:57.387
I hoped to find you alone.

01:33:59.188 --> 01:34:01.429
I thought they'd have left.

01:34:12.914 --> 01:34:15.355
We'll call you Hope in future.

01:34:22.238 --> 01:34:23.319
Damn you all!

01:34:40.487 --> 01:34:42.488
What did you say to her?

01:34:42.768 --> 01:34:47.890
That I was looking forward to my wedding
night but the rest was a farce.

01:34:56.494 --> 01:34:59.035
<i>She was too free too wild.</i>

01:34:59.455 --> 01:35:03.817
<i>The more I asked her questions,
the more annoying I was.</i>

01:35:04.058 --> 01:35:05.818
<i>A stupid husband.</i>

01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:07.259
Your turn

01:35:15.663 --> 01:35:17.904
<i>In one way I was right.</i>

01:35:18.024 --> 01:35:20.745
<i>From the 17th to the 26th.</i>

01:35:20.865 --> 01:35:25.988
<i>That's how long our marriage lasted
but nothing else turned out...</i>

01:35:26.108 --> 01:35:27.268
<i>as I thought.</i>

01:35:27.468 --> 01:35:31.110
<i>On Wednesday when I came home for
lunch she was missing.</i>

01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:32.511
No idea where she went?

01:35:34.391 --> 01:35:35.432
You asked her?

01:35:36.632 --> 01:35:37.833
What did she say?

01:35:40.394 --> 01:35:43.836
The girl must go out sometimes. I expect
she's sunbathing.

01:35:44.316 --> 01:35:48.758
No, she was wearing her red dress
and had a handbag.

01:35:51.279 --> 01:35:52.480
Do you know anything?

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.683
We aren't going to steal your plate.
You'll choke one of these days.

01:36:00.563 --> 01:36:02.884
You're going back to the garage?

01:36:12.289 --> 01:36:14.370
What will they think?

01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:16.611
Let them think what they like.

01:36:23.494 --> 01:36:25.895
You aren't a teacher, are you?

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:30.017
What do you do?

01:36:31.177 --> 01:36:32.138
Nothing.

01:36:48.545 --> 01:36:50.987
Why did you come to Carpentras?

01:36:51.187 --> 01:36:54.108
It was just chance really.

01:36:56.989 --> 01:36:59.030
But I'm glad I came.

01:37:02.632 --> 01:37:04.553
<i>This time he made up his mind.</i>

01:37:04.673 --> 01:37:08.375
<i>He put his tongue in my mouth and I'd
have vomited...</i>

01:37:08.675 --> 01:37:12.356
<i>but for the vow I'd made to kill
them both.</i>

01:37:15.918 --> 01:37:19.320
<i>He wasn't interested in my state
of mind, the bastard.</i>

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.881
Not here.

01:37:26.123 --> 01:37:29.324
Will you take my brother in law's flat?

01:37:29.564 --> 01:37:31.805
I'd forgotten about it.

01:37:33.406 --> 01:37:37.088
If you like, I'll take it.

01:37:48.133 --> 01:37:49.333
There's no need.

01:37:50.214 --> 01:37:52.215
It's just a little something.

01:38:01.339 --> 01:38:04.060
Right, I'll go to the agent's.

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:09.583
I'll meet you tonight.

01:38:09.743 --> 01:38:11.744
I can't manage tonight.

01:38:13.825 --> 01:38:18.427
I've things to do in Nice. But I'll ring
directly I'm back.

01:38:19.907 --> 01:38:20.988
I promise.

01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:27.511
Be nice.

01:38:30.432 --> 01:38:34.114
I'm dying for it too. Call me a taxi.

01:38:34.354 --> 01:38:36.235
<i>Off I went for the keys.</i>

01:38:36.395 --> 01:38:39.356
<i>I scoured the shops for the right togs.</i>

01:38:39.476 --> 01:38:42.518
Come in quick. You mustn't be seen.

01:38:43.998 --> 01:38:46.920
What are you doing in a place like this?

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.561
If you were found here, it'd be
a catastrophe.

01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:52.362
But you asked me.

01:38:53.203 --> 01:38:55.083
Don't speak so loud.

01:38:57.685 --> 01:38:58.605
Listen.

01:39:02.327 --> 01:39:05.448
Some things I can only tell to you.

01:39:05.488 --> 01:39:09.210
I can't tell my mother or even Pin-Pon.

01:39:11.931 --> 01:39:15.573
Promise you won't tell anyone.
Swear it.

01:39:15.773 --> 01:39:17.774
I swear, but what is it?

01:39:18.334 --> 01:39:19.295
Listen.

01:39:22.816 --> 01:39:25.377
Last summer when we lived in Arrame.

01:39:25.497 --> 01:39:30.099
I used to go up into the hills
to sunbathe.

01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:33.721
One day, I was on my own when
two men...

01:39:34.061 --> 01:39:37.383
well, they grabbed hold of me.

01:39:39.464 --> 01:39:42.465
I was too scared to tell anyone.

01:39:42.905 --> 01:39:47.487
Later, they came to the house and
I was even more scared.

01:39:47.587 --> 01:39:50.549
So I went with them to the woods.

01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:52.630
Of your own accord?

01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:55.791
You don't know what they were like.

01:39:55.911 --> 01:40:00.113
They threatened to beat me up,
and my mother too.

01:40:00.393 --> 01:40:03.195
I hoped, once I'd married, they'd stop.

01:40:05.596 --> 01:40:11.478
But no. They came to the village
on my wedding day.

01:40:11.598 --> 01:40:12.799
They made me.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.481
So you see why they rented me this flat?

01:40:19.682 --> 01:40:23.484
To receive men, to be a prostitute.

01:40:25.685 --> 01:40:27.806
<i>She cried so much...</i>

01:40:27.886 --> 01:40:29.487
<i>we nearly drowned.</i>

01:40:29.647 --> 01:40:34.289
If anything happens, see Pin-Pon gets
this.

01:40:34.449 --> 01:40:37.290
It gives their names and addresses.

01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:41.012
The flat keys will always be
in the letter box.

01:40:43.773 --> 01:40:45.494
It's not for you.

01:40:46.615 --> 01:40:52.417
Only Pin-Pon must know.
Remember that.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.741
If one day you have to tell him.

01:41:02.422 --> 01:41:06.824
Say what hurt me the most...

01:41:06.944 --> 01:41:11.426
was what they did to me on
our wedding day.

01:41:22.231 --> 01:41:23.672
Don't torture yourself.

01:41:23.752 --> 01:41:26.393
- What are you saying?
- There's no need to shout.

01:41:28.914 --> 01:41:30.915
Where's her knitting now?

01:41:48.243 --> 01:41:49.924
Hit me and I'll leave.

01:41:50.084 --> 01:41:52.565
Tell me. Where have you been?

01:41:54.246 --> 01:41:56.447
Go ahead, hit me.

01:42:16.616 --> 01:42:18.177
I've lost a heel.

01:42:21.738 --> 01:42:27.461
I went to town to look at the shops
and I missed the last bus.

01:42:27.621 --> 01:42:29.262
Where's your shopping then?

01:42:29.382 --> 01:42:32.863
I didn't need anything. I was just
looking.

01:42:32.983 --> 01:42:36.465
Between your mother and aunt,
life's not much fun.

01:42:43.828 --> 01:42:47.310
Button your dress. Must you show
yourself to everyone?

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:51.872
Come on.

01:42:53.073 --> 01:42:57.180
I'm fed up with the dress too. I Won't
wear it any more.

01:42:57.915 --> 01:43:00.556
Is it my cooking you dislike?

01:43:01.276 --> 01:43:02.637
How did you guess?

01:43:03.357 --> 01:43:04.838
I prefer my mother's.

01:43:05.038 --> 01:43:08.360
When you're expecting, you have to eat.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.841
You don't knit much these days.

01:43:13.962 --> 01:43:15.723
Have you lost your tongue?

01:43:15.763 --> 01:43:18.564
I've put on two kilos since I came here.

01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:20.965
Then I'm scolded for not eating.

01:43:21.245 --> 01:43:27.328
<i>What annoyed me most was that she
took me for a fool - and I was.</i>

01:43:27.648 --> 01:43:30.890
Catch. Your mother can use it
for polishing.

01:43:46.977 --> 01:43:49.458
So this baby was pure invention?

01:43:55.981 --> 01:43:57.302
I'm speaking to you.

01:43:59.823 --> 01:44:01.824
Yes, you were saying?

01:44:03.985 --> 01:44:05.986
Pure invention. Admit it!

01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:18.992
<i>I don't know what I said...
that I wanted an answer...</i>

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:21.913
<i>that we could have married anyway.</i>

01:44:27.156 --> 01:44:31.157
There, there, my dear, it's all over.
Calm down.

01:44:48.726 --> 01:44:54.248
You were always the calm one.
I didn't recognise you.

01:44:54.408 --> 01:44:56.809
You even hit her on the breast.

01:44:57.009 --> 01:44:59.210
- He wasn't in control.
- Exactly.

01:45:00.731 --> 01:45:04.213
<i>That night I was called to
a forest fire near Grasse.</i>

01:45:06.854 --> 01:45:11.736
<i>For the first time that summer
I was good to leave home.</i>

01:45:12.016 --> 01:45:14.457
<i>It was two days before I got back.</i>

01:45:23.261 --> 01:45:26.463
I won't be much good for a bit.

01:45:27.143 --> 01:45:28.624
Careful! It hurts.

01:45:30.305 --> 01:45:31.865
How was it?

01:45:31.985 --> 01:45:34.867
It's still burning on a wide front.

01:45:34.987 --> 01:45:38.108
We saw it on TV. It's too bad.

01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:42.350
I'll have a shower and go to bed.

01:45:53.995 --> 01:45:57.357
I don't mind if you have a baby now
or later.

01:45:58.878 --> 01:46:01.559
But I can't bear you lying.

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:09.202
I've the feeling you're hiding something
from me and it makes me furious.

01:46:09.883 --> 01:46:12.964
If I am, it's not what you think.

01:46:14.405 --> 01:46:15.565
I love you.

01:46:17.926 --> 01:46:21.608
Go to your fires till the cows come
home, I'll still be faithful.

01:46:24.569 --> 01:46:25.530
It's true.

01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:27.331
So what's the secret?

01:46:27.731 --> 01:46:30.372
If I ever tell it, it will be to you.

01:46:32.053 --> 01:46:33.013
I swear.

01:46:37.175 --> 01:46:43.618
<i>Arabedian, Tarrazzi and Montecciari
are in the lead at the sprint.</i>

01:46:55.784 --> 01:46:58.585
<i>Mickey was winning all the sprints.</i>

01:46:58.785 --> 01:47:03.547
<i>He kept just behind Tarrazzi till
the last moment.</i>

01:47:03.747 --> 01:47:05.388
<i>Then shot past him.</i>

01:47:06.509 --> 01:47:08.670
He's going to win!

01:47:11.511 --> 01:47:13.872
<i>Then Mickey dropped back.</i>

01:47:13.992 --> 01:47:17.914
<i>And I lost Elle in the crowd.</i>

01:47:28.759 --> 01:47:30.840
Explain yourself.

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.601
What do you want?

01:47:34.762 --> 01:47:36.162
I saw my old boss.

01:47:39.004 --> 01:47:42.004
You're the Devigne girl from Arrame.

01:47:42.605 --> 01:47:44.686
You've married a Montecciari.

01:47:44.806 --> 01:47:45.767
So what?

01:47:47.968 --> 01:47:51.329
I'll tell you one thing about that night
at your parents'.

01:47:51.489 --> 01:47:54.571
My brother-in law and I weren't involved.

01:47:57.372 --> 01:48:01.074
You didn't deliver the piano to
the Montecciari?

01:48:01.654 --> 01:48:03.335
Let me out of here.

01:48:04.655 --> 01:48:07.957
You're going to listen. It won't take
long.

01:48:08.257 --> 01:48:09.337
<i>That November...</i>

01:48:09.538 --> 01:48:12.339
<i>I bought my sawmill. You can check.</i>

01:48:12.539 --> 01:48:17.621
<i>I visited Touret to sign the papers
but I had to keep it quiet.</i>

01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:20.943
<i>So I found two mates to do my
deliveries.</i>

01:48:21.183 --> 01:48:24.264
<i>It was after eleven when they came back.</i>

01:48:26.465 --> 01:48:28.966
Do you know what time it is?

01:48:32.108 --> 01:48:33.188
We got stuck.

01:48:33.429 --> 01:48:37.270
<i>The one, Pamier, got a job in Avignon.</i>

01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:42.433
<i>Fiero, the Italian, became manager
of a bar in Marseilles.</i>

01:48:44.113 --> 01:48:48.635
<i>I only knew the other one by sight.
A hooligan called Rostolan.</i>

01:48:50.276 --> 01:48:53.998
Get the hell out of here. Piss off!

01:49:01.641 --> 01:49:04.883
And they didn't even deliver the organ.

01:49:05.043 --> 01:49:07.404
It'll only take half an hour.

01:49:08.645 --> 01:49:10.646
So that's what we did.

01:49:11.726 --> 01:49:13.007
Don't believe me?

01:49:15.768 --> 01:49:19.970
My head's not just something to put
a hat on.

01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:23.051
- Why would I lie?
- Yes, why?

01:49:23.612 --> 01:49:28.814
If you weren't there, how did you know
the van stopped at my parents'?

01:49:29.534 --> 01:49:31.835
Because I've had trouble before.

01:49:32.656 --> 01:49:35.097
Ten years ago, your father came...

01:49:35.337 --> 01:49:38.658
and I told him the same thing.

01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:42.340
Who?

01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.221
Your father. Gabriel Devigne.

01:49:48.263 --> 01:49:50.144
Ask him yourself.

01:49:56.066 --> 01:49:59.108
I don't believe you, you bastard.

01:50:10.953 --> 01:50:16.136
<i>When I finally saw Elle, she seemed
to be sleepwalking.</i>

01:50:17.276 --> 01:50:20.798
<i>That was my very first thought.</i>

01:50:30.842 --> 01:50:32.443
What's the matter?

01:50:45.089 --> 01:50:46.610
Just be quiet.

01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:48.691
Don't move.

01:50:50.131 --> 01:50:55.173
<i>I didn't even dare speak to her.
She was passive and remote.</i>

01:50:55.974 --> 01:50:58.175
<i>I didn't even hear who won.</i>

01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:13.142
It must be sunstroke or
something she ate at midday.

01:51:13.302 --> 01:51:17.184
What's the matter? Paula, come up here!

01:51:17.424 --> 01:51:19.465
Shut up, you up there.

01:51:21.626 --> 01:51:23.707
Let's leave them.

01:51:25.067 --> 01:51:29.149
Speak to me. Please speak to me.

01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:34.952
Your brother is right.
Leave her here tonight.

01:51:49.678 --> 01:51:53.040
<i>That's roughly what happened.</i>

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.942
<i>Who can say what really happens?
None of us sees it all.</i>

01:52:02.284 --> 01:52:03.485
Still bad?

01:52:05.606 --> 01:52:09.327
I'll be back at midday. Drink up
your chocolate.

01:52:09.608 --> 01:52:10.808
I don't feel like it.

01:52:21.213 --> 01:52:24.935
What's this? It's not like you to bite
your nails.

01:52:29.257 --> 01:52:30.217
Off you go now.

01:52:47.945 --> 01:52:49.986
I won't open the door.

01:52:52.107 --> 01:52:54.068
Please let me in.

01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:59.591
I must speak to you.

01:53:02.072 --> 01:53:03.512
Are you ill?

01:53:06.634 --> 01:53:07.834
Let me come in.

01:53:08.835 --> 01:53:10.516
To tell me what?

01:53:14.757 --> 01:53:16.678
Did you know Leballech?

01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:24.082
You can't get in.

01:53:25.002 --> 01:53:27.003
Come on now. Go away.

01:53:35.527 --> 01:53:36.848
Stop that.

01:53:38.488 --> 01:53:41.170
Leballech had nothing to do with it.

01:53:51.334 --> 01:53:52.535
You saw him?

01:54:01.539 --> 01:54:03.100
I'll get the axe.

01:54:17.026 --> 01:54:18.707
Yes, I saw Leballech.

01:54:19.667 --> 01:54:21.068
And Touret too.

01:54:23.909 --> 01:54:25.110
You were nine...

01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:28.271
when I found the organ.

01:54:31.673 --> 01:54:35.114
They lied to you too.

01:54:35.995 --> 01:54:38.956
No. I already knew Leballech.

01:54:39.876 --> 01:54:42.158
Before they attacked your mother.

01:54:42.518 --> 01:54:44.759
She would have recognised him.

01:54:45.919 --> 01:54:52.342
But what do you want? To find out
which of the bastards..

01:54:52.642 --> 01:54:54.203
was your father?

01:54:58.405 --> 01:55:01.046
No. You're my father.

01:55:14.292 --> 01:55:16.373
Why did you say that?

01:55:23.937 --> 01:55:28.219
You knew where they were and
who they were!

01:55:32.901 --> 01:55:35.542
Why didn't you say?

01:55:46.467 --> 01:55:48.708
And have my head cut off?

01:55:56.312 --> 01:55:57.392
Come closer.

01:56:06.276 --> 01:56:10.578
Do you remember the day I went to see
my sister in Puget?

01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:15.320
<i>I didn't go to my sister's.</i>

01:56:22.323 --> 01:56:25.805
I'll be back on the seven o'clock bus.

01:56:31.007 --> 01:56:33.689
<i>Fiero was in July in Marseilles.</i>

01:56:34.449 --> 01:56:36.610
- Sorry, we're closing.
- Just a brandy.

01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:37.931
No, it's late.

01:56:46.414 --> 01:56:49.896
<i>Pamier was three weeks later
in Avignon.</i>

01:56:54.298 --> 01:56:55.779
Is someone there?

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:04.063
<i>Rostollan was in September,
again in Marseilles.</i>

01:57:04.263 --> 01:57:06.104
Did you call for a cab?

01:57:06.944 --> 01:57:09.945
You've brought me to an odd spot.

01:57:11.266 --> 01:57:12.627
Where's it to?

01:57:13.307 --> 01:57:15.408
You can tell the police.

01:57:16.989 --> 01:57:19.029
I don't care any more.

01:57:20.150 --> 01:57:21.270
I'm finished.

01:57:24.992 --> 01:57:26.713
I did it for you.

01:57:27.994 --> 01:57:31.035
For you, I'd have done anything.

01:57:36.838 --> 01:57:40.799
In the cellar in the lining of
my jacket.

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.761
Go and look.

01:58:35.344 --> 01:58:37.105
<i>If they were dead...</i>

01:58:37.265 --> 01:58:39.907
<i>I thought it would be like before.</i>

01:58:40.787 --> 01:58:46.950
<i>But they've been dead a long time
And nothing has come right.</i>

01:58:54.953 --> 01:58:57.274
I hear you were ill yesterday.

01:58:58.955 --> 01:59:00.316
Feeling better?

01:59:01.717 --> 01:59:04.118
Won't you come in for a moment?

01:59:05.238 --> 01:59:07.439
Where are you going?

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.682
<i>What was I doing just now?</i>

01:59:13.042 --> 01:59:14.482
<i>And this morning?</i>

01:59:15.723 --> 01:59:17.244
<i>And yesterday?</i>

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:21.566
<i>It just be another of those bad dreams.</i>

01:59:23.166 --> 01:59:26.848
<i>I know when I'm myself and that's now.</i>

01:59:26.888 --> 01:59:28.089
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

01:59:34.452 --> 01:59:37.253
Pin-Pon looking for his wife again.

01:59:37.413 --> 01:59:38.854
You've not seen her?

01:59:39.374 --> 01:59:40.854
Not on the bus?

01:59:47.097 --> 01:59:49.658
I suppose you think this is funny.

01:59:49.979 --> 01:59:51.499
Of course not, Pin-Pon.

01:59:51.659 --> 01:59:53.420
Don't call me that

01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:56.502
Do you boast about her?

01:59:57.262 --> 01:59:58.703
You're wrong.

02:00:02.344 --> 02:00:03.305
Idiot!

02:00:05.666 --> 02:00:09.388
He's knocked his teeth out.
Call the police!

02:00:09.588 --> 02:00:11.188
No, he can't help it.

02:00:17.631 --> 02:00:19.192
She's been found.

02:00:19.232 --> 02:00:24.154
In a hospital in Carpentras. Her teacher
is on the telephone.

02:00:24.675 --> 02:00:27.956
He's knocked out two of Massigne's
teeth.

02:00:28.076 --> 02:00:30.197
Teach him to keep his mouth shut.

02:00:30.277 --> 02:00:35.600
I can't speak on the 'phone.
They've done terrible things to her.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.601
Who have? Explain.

02:00:39.561 --> 02:00:42.443
They won't let you see her today.

02:00:42.603 --> 02:00:44.203
What's wrong with her?

02:00:44.324 --> 02:00:48.686
She doesn't know who she is.
She says she's Eliane Devigne.

02:00:48.846 --> 02:00:52.968
<i>She lives in Arrame and
she's nine years old.</i>

02:00:53.128 --> 02:00:55.048
I'll be right over.

02:00:59.611 --> 02:01:01.371
Go and change first.

02:01:01.411 --> 02:01:02.812
What for?

02:01:02.972 --> 02:01:04.733
I'll take the car.

02:01:21.461 --> 02:01:23.301
What are you going to do?

02:02:16.966 --> 02:02:19.007
A visitor for you, Eliane.

02:02:22.889 --> 02:02:24.009
He knows you.

02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:28.611
This gentleman knows your father.

02:02:33.053 --> 02:02:36.095
He's brought you some lovely flowers.

02:03:02.827 --> 02:03:06.129
Is there anything I can bring you?

02:03:10.751 --> 02:03:13.952
I'd like my gold heart and my glasses.

02:03:17.594 --> 02:03:18.714
And I'd like...

02:03:28.479 --> 02:03:30.760
Yes. What would you like?

02:03:33.721 --> 02:03:37.683
The gentleman is going to bring
your father here.

02:03:38.443 --> 02:03:41.445
By car. Very soon.

02:03:46.807 --> 02:03:48.528
I'd love that.

02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:56.532
That'll be lovely.

02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:16.541
It's time we left.

02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:41.672
Come along, I warned you.
Be sensible.

02:04:43.593 --> 02:04:46.535
She won't be like that for ever.

02:04:48.195 --> 02:04:49.316
She can't be.

02:04:50.036 --> 02:04:52.437
She's only twenty. There's still hope.

02:04:57.079 --> 02:04:59.240
I must explain.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:02.742
Your wife has been mentally unbalanced
for a long time.

02:05:03.642 --> 02:05:07.084
A neurosis has built up over the years.

02:05:09.285 --> 02:05:13.386
And, following some terrible emotional
shocks...
