WEBVTT

00:02.484 --> 00:05.286
I was reading about this
jellyfish that never dies.

00:05.287 --> 00:07.155
Instead, it reverts
to its asexual state

00:07.157 --> 00:08.706
and then grows up again.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.575
We thought my 90-year-old
grandfather had reverted

00:10.577 --> 00:12.326
to an asexual state,
but the lawsuit

00:12.328 --> 00:15.696
from his Jamaican caregiver
proved us all wrong.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.965
My point is, immortality is not

00:17.967 --> 00:19.700
only a possibility, it is real.

00:19.702 --> 00:22.003
Only if you're this
jellyfish which periodically

00:22.005 --> 00:25.173
reverts to a mass of
undifferentiated protoplasm.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.757
If I could keep
my Gmail account,

00:26.759 --> 00:28.810
I'd be okay with that.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.813
- Hello, fellas.
- Hey.

00:31.815 --> 00:34.265
Remember when we were trying
to figure out what that smell

00:34.267 --> 00:36.050
coming from Professor
Tupperman's office was?

00:36.052 --> 00:37.051
Yeah?

00:37.053 --> 00:39.437
Turns out it was Tupperman.

00:40.689 --> 00:42.490
Dead at his desk for two weeks.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.609
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.560
In lieu of flowers,
the department chair

00:46.562 --> 00:50.581
is asking that everyone donate
a bottle of Febreze.

00:51.733 --> 00:53.751
If we're going to change
the topic from jellyfish,

00:53.753 --> 00:55.286
I'd be okay with brine shrimp

00:55.288 --> 00:57.538
or the history of the unicycle.

00:58.373 --> 01:01.042
Show a little compassion--
a man died.

01:01.044 --> 01:02.910
And turned into a puddle of goo.

01:02.912 --> 01:04.345
Now, we can either

01:04.346 --> 01:07.849
sit around and cry
over spilt professor, or...

01:07.851 --> 01:09.684
we can rejoice in the knowledge

01:09.686 --> 01:12.386
that a tenured position
has just opened up.

01:12.388 --> 01:13.437
I choose to do

01:13.439 --> 01:15.473
the latter.

01:15.475 --> 01:18.759
Excuse me, the whole tenure
system is ridiculous.

01:18.761 --> 01:20.111
A guaranteed job for life

01:20.113 --> 01:22.697
only encourages the faculty
to become complacent.

01:22.699 --> 01:24.031
If we really
want science

01:24.033 --> 01:25.950
to advance, people should have

01:25.952 --> 01:28.069
chips implanted in their skulls

01:28.071 --> 01:31.405
that explode when they say
something stupid.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.942
Well, I believe people
do their best work

01:34.944 --> 01:36.961
when they feel
safe and secure.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.968
If you need my nose,
you'll find it firmly lodged

01:43.970 --> 01:46.954
up the rectum of the
tenure committee.

01:48.006 --> 01:50.725
You Ph.D's gonna go
suck up like Kripke?

01:50.727 --> 01:51.759
No.

01:51.761 --> 01:52.927
I mean, I'll apply,

01:52.929 --> 01:55.263
but I'm not gonna stoop
to playing politics.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.265
Yeah, me neither.
It should be about the work.

01:57.267 --> 01:58.399
And if I can't get tenure,

01:58.401 --> 02:00.484
I'd like to see you
or Sheldon get it.

02:00.486 --> 02:02.436
Raj, don't dangle
false hope

02:02.438 --> 02:04.906
in front of Leonard like that.

02:04.908 --> 02:06.640
Excuse me, but I think I'm

02:06.642 --> 02:08.576
just as qualified as you are.

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

02:41.989 --> 02:44.459
So "tenured" means
a job for life?

02:44.460 --> 02:46.076
Yup.
And you can't get fired

02:46.078 --> 02:47.078
even if you're bad at it?

02:47.079 --> 02:48.546
Mm, not really.

02:48.548 --> 02:50.965
Wow, sounds a lot like being
a pretty waitress

02:50.967 --> 02:52.750
at the Cheesecake Factory.

02:54.035 --> 02:56.921
While I disagree
with the premise of tenure,

02:56.923 --> 02:58.205
if they gave it to me,

02:58.207 --> 02:59.840
it wouldn't diminish my output.

02:59.842 --> 03:01.809
You know, I'm like the sun.

03:01.811 --> 03:04.011
Can't turn this off.

03:05.146 --> 03:08.732
Are Rajesh and Leonard
competing for it as well?

03:08.734 --> 03:09.883
Mm-hmm.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.569
Do they know they
don't stand a chance

03:11.571 --> 03:13.037
'cause you're so great?

03:13.039 --> 03:15.139
Well put.

03:16.074 --> 03:18.158
You know, I must say
I go back and forth

03:18.160 --> 03:19.944
on this boyfriend-girlfriend
thing, but those moments

03:19.946 --> 03:22.780
when you worship me
really keep you in the running.

03:26.401 --> 03:28.335
It would be nice to have
the increased income.

03:28.337 --> 03:29.837
Stop taking money
from my parents.

03:29.839 --> 03:32.756
Money from family does come
with strings attached.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.708
You have no idea.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.378
They buy me a new BMW
for my birthday

03:37.380 --> 03:39.096
but can I get seat warmers?

03:39.098 --> 03:40.798
No.

03:41.616 --> 03:42.933
"Rajesh, if you
want a warm butt,

03:42.935 --> 03:44.251
you're gonna have
to pay for it yourself."

03:44.253 --> 03:46.186
Well, maybe I will, old man!

03:49.307 --> 03:53.477
I think that's
enough wine for now.

03:53.479 --> 03:55.362
I just keep thinking
about how cool it would be

03:55.364 --> 03:56.997
if I called my mom and told her

03:56.999 --> 03:59.149
that I got tenure at Caltech.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.367
She'd be proud, huh?

04:00.369 --> 04:01.435
Oh, very.

04:01.437 --> 04:03.937
Assuming she takes my call.

04:05.206 --> 04:08.309
My primary concern
with being granted tenure

04:08.311 --> 04:11.512
is living with an insanely
jealous roommate after the fact.

04:11.514 --> 04:14.248
I might need to sleep
with a gun under my pillow.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.800
Or a chainsaw.

04:16.802 --> 04:20.220
Or you take advantage of your
newfound economic stability

04:20.221 --> 04:21.471
and move out...

04:21.474 --> 04:23.290
buy a house...

04:23.292 --> 04:24.958
get married...

04:24.960 --> 04:27.461
start a family.

04:28.296 --> 04:29.763
Yeah, or...

04:29.765 --> 04:31.899
the chainsaw.

04:34.019 --> 04:36.854
And I will return
to New Delhi in triumph

04:36.856 --> 04:39.940
atop a bejeweled white elephant!

04:39.942 --> 04:42.326
And you know
what will be

04:42.328 --> 04:43.360
on that elephant's back?

04:43.362 --> 04:45.479
A seat warmer.

04:46.731 --> 04:50.668
"No, Father, you may not
have a ride!"

04:51.819 --> 04:53.454
I'm gonna make some coffee.

04:55.573 --> 04:57.908
So, who do you have to schmooze
to get this deal?

04:57.910 --> 04:59.543
I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.

04:59.545 --> 05:01.462
I'm gonna let my work
speak for itself.

05:01.464 --> 05:02.630
That's great.

05:02.632 --> 05:04.098
That shows a lot of integrity.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.133
Thank you.

05:06.135 --> 05:08.552
I'm a naive idiot, right?

05:08.554 --> 05:10.804
Oh, good, you heard me.

05:11.806 --> 05:13.223
You know, if you
really want tenure,

05:13.225 --> 05:15.609
maybe you should cozy up to
the people making the decision.

05:15.611 --> 05:18.729
Sheldon Cooper
does not do "cozy."

05:18.731 --> 05:22.316
You don't say.

05:22.318 --> 05:24.034
But I suppose
it wouldn't hurt

05:24.036 --> 05:25.653
to know who's
on the committee.

05:25.655 --> 05:27.187
Let's see...

05:27.189 --> 05:29.022
Oh, Janine Davis.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.190
Oh, dear.

05:30.192 --> 05:31.825
Is that a problem?

05:31.827 --> 05:34.161
Well...

05:34.163 --> 05:35.245
Yeah, even you.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.880
You're a slave.

05:40.502 --> 05:42.870
I'm a what?

05:44.439 --> 05:47.474
I'm not sure;
it could go either way.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.074

05:57.051 --> 05:59.720
Hey. Mrs. Davis.

05:59.722 --> 06:00.654
Hey.
Hey.

06:00.656 --> 06:03.190
Dr. Hofstadter.
Yeah.

06:03.192 --> 06:05.109
Just thought I'd come down
and start getting ready

06:05.111 --> 06:06.276
for swimsuit season.

06:08.030 --> 06:09.730
Good for you.
Eh.

06:09.732 --> 06:10.781
Not that you need it.

06:10.783 --> 06:12.499
I bet you look great
in a swimsuit.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.069
Thank you.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.405
I've got what my father used
to call "furniture disease."

06:18.407 --> 06:20.040
My chest is falling
into my drawers.

06:26.765 --> 06:29.016
I'm not, uh, familiar
with this model.

06:29.018 --> 06:30.684
How do I make it start?

06:30.686 --> 06:33.053
You push start.

06:33.055 --> 06:35.305
Right.

06:42.697 --> 06:44.531
This one might be broken.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.316
You have to move.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.869
Got it.

06:48.871 --> 06:50.437
Oh.

06:50.439 --> 06:52.823
There.

06:57.996 --> 06:59.446
Oh, yeah!

07:00.281 --> 07:03.083
Yeah, now I'm <i>feeling</i> it.

07:04.252 --> 07:05.803
Oh, this is great.

07:05.805 --> 07:08.422
I could do this
for the rest of my life.

07:08.424 --> 07:09.840
Hey, speaking...

07:09.842 --> 07:12.826
speaking of things you do
for the rest of your life...

07:12.828 --> 07:16.296
uh, did I read that you're
on that-that tenure committee?

07:16.298 --> 07:17.631
Yep.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.800
I got to get a home gym.

07:21.519 --> 07:24.738
Well, I'm sure you have
a lot of good applicants, I just

07:24.740 --> 07:27.741
wanted to say hi and...

07:27.743 --> 07:29.610
let you know that I'll be...

07:29.612 --> 07:31.144
throwing my hat in the...

07:33.482 --> 07:35.699
...ring.

07:35.701 --> 07:37.553
All right, I'll keep
an eye out for that.

07:37.578 --> 07:38.169
Yeah.

07:38.170 --> 07:41.071
Hey, Hofstadter.

07:41.073 --> 07:43.090
Funny seeing you here
for the first time in...

07:43.092 --> 07:45.509
ever.

07:45.511 --> 07:48.679
Go... away.

07:49.547 --> 07:51.048
Janine the Machine,
let's do this!

07:51.050 --> 07:52.332
Hey, Barry.

07:53.718 --> 07:55.018
Well, look at that.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.521
Burned a whole calorie.

07:57.523 --> 07:59.056
I guess you got here

07:59.058 --> 08:02.059
early to burn off that
banana bread I baked you.

08:02.061 --> 08:03.677
Yeah, it was delicious.
Thank you.

08:03.679 --> 08:04.695
No, my pleasure.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.680
Oh, if you... if you
like banana bread...

08:06.682 --> 08:08.949
I've got a-a great recipe.

08:08.951 --> 08:11.451
The trick
is in... in fresh ground...

08:11.453 --> 08:14.571
I'll e-mail it to you.

08:14.573 --> 08:15.622
All right, I'm warm.

08:15.624 --> 08:17.291
Ready to kick it up a notch?

08:17.293 --> 08:19.693
Let's go.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.295
That's enough cardio for me.

08:21.297 --> 08:24.548
I'm just... gonna stretch out
before I hit the weights.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.804
You okay?

08:31.673 --> 08:34.207
Call someone!

08:38.679 --> 08:41.532
Good day, Mrs. Davis.

08:41.534 --> 08:42.933
This is Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali

08:42.934 --> 08:45.402
from the astrophysics
department.

08:45.404 --> 08:46.887
Don't be alarmed,

08:46.889 --> 08:49.556
I'm not really in space.

08:52.243 --> 08:55.245
Anyhoo...

08:55.247 --> 08:56.730
I'd like to take
this opportunity

08:56.732 --> 08:58.231
to tell you about myself,

08:58.233 --> 09:00.667
so sit back, relax and enjoy

09:00.669 --> 09:03.337
the following 90-minute video.

09:03.339 --> 09:05.389
Oh, come on.

09:07.158 --> 09:08.458
<i>Born in New Delhi,</i>

09:08.460 --> 09:11.261
<i>the third son</i>
<i>of an itinerant gynecologist,</i>

09:11.263 --> 09:14.498
<i>I showed early</i>
<i>signs of genius.</i>

09:14.500 --> 09:17.868
<i>At the age of five,</i>
<i>I discovered a celestial object</i>

09:17.870 --> 09:21.305
<i>which later turned out</i>
<i>to be the moon.</i>

09:24.627 --> 09:25.926
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis? Mrs. Davis?

09:25.928 --> 09:28.145
Mrs. Davis?

09:28.147 --> 09:30.647
God, they're everywhere.

09:30.649 --> 09:32.699
Come in.

09:34.035 --> 09:35.903
Dr. Cooper,
how can I help you?

09:35.905 --> 09:38.071
Yes, hello. I'm fine. Um...

09:39.908 --> 09:42.576
I understand you may have
a bad impression of me,

09:42.578 --> 09:44.745
so I bought you a gift.

09:44.747 --> 09:46.780
Uh, Dr. Cooper,
that's not necessary.

09:46.782 --> 09:47.948
It's too late.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.550
Get ready to like me.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.272
<i>Roots?</i>

09:56.674 --> 10:01.511
The tragic history
of slavery in America.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.014
Fun for the whole family.

10:05.967 --> 10:08.652
Why would you think
this is an appropriate gift?

10:08.654 --> 10:10.988
Um...

10:10.990 --> 10:13.273
Well...

10:15.910 --> 10:18.111
You are black, right?

10:20.114 --> 10:22.516
This meeting has come to an end.

10:22.518 --> 10:24.818
Because you want to start
watching it right now.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.370
Copy that.

10:27.221 --> 10:29.589
Let's see.

10:29.591 --> 10:33.043
Up next
on the tenure committee is...

10:33.045 --> 10:35.145
Professor Wu.

10:35.147 --> 10:38.765
Well, get ready for the complete
works of Jackie Chan.

10:48.437 --> 10:50.438
Gentlemen.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.956
Where have
you been?

10:51.958 --> 10:54.092
Nurse's office.

10:55.244 --> 10:56.194
Asthma attack?

10:56.196 --> 10:58.112
Asthma, heart--
some kind of attack.

10:58.114 --> 10:59.748
I'm fine, though.

11:00.750 --> 11:01.949
You guys going

11:01.951 --> 11:03.117
to Professor Tupperman's
memorial?

11:03.119 --> 11:04.135
I don't know.
Probably not.

11:04.137 --> 11:05.220
Barely knew him.

11:05.222 --> 11:06.504
Yeah, you wouldn't want to look

11:06.506 --> 11:08.623
like you guys are brown-nosing
the tenure committee,

11:08.625 --> 11:10.124
who will all be there.

11:12.178 --> 11:15.313
Oh, yeah, that's what
I was hoping for-- meerkats.

11:21.821 --> 11:25.356
I won't be able to make our
date night this Thursday, so...

11:25.358 --> 11:27.308
bad news for you.

11:28.194 --> 11:30.195
You better have a
good excuse this time,

11:30.197 --> 11:32.363
because "trimming Q-tips
to fit your ears right"

11:32.365 --> 11:34.148
is obvious nonsense.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.401
First of all,

11:36.403 --> 11:38.870
when you say things like that,
people think you're crazy.

11:38.872 --> 11:42.490
Second, the reason
I'm cancelling is because

11:42.492 --> 11:45.493
I have to attend a memorial
service for Professor Tupperman.

11:45.495 --> 11:47.829
It sounds like a long
and tedious evening.

11:47.831 --> 11:49.330
Eh, it will be.

11:49.332 --> 11:51.883
Honestly, if I must endure
a long and tedious evening,

11:51.885 --> 11:54.352
I'd rather it be
with you on date night.

11:54.354 --> 11:56.438
But I have no choice.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.940
The tenure committee's
going to be there.

11:58.942 --> 12:01.843
Oh! Well, in that case,
perhaps I should come along.

12:01.845 --> 12:04.679
Well, now that I think about it,
that would be most helpful.

12:04.681 --> 12:05.814
Of course it would.

12:05.816 --> 12:07.849
I'm well-versed in
academic politics,

12:07.851 --> 12:09.451
and as a respected scientist,

12:09.453 --> 12:11.870
I can only raise your
stock as a candidate.

12:11.872 --> 12:14.873
Actually, I meant
you could drive me.

12:16.992 --> 12:20.361
But if it makes you happy,
that other stuff, too.

12:22.832 --> 12:25.133
Do anything
interesting today?

12:25.135 --> 12:27.135
Oh, not really.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.553
I was out shopping with Amy.

12:28.555 --> 12:30.605
She wanted me
to help her find something

12:30.607 --> 12:31.706
for this memorial thing.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.174
Wait--
Sheldon's going to be there?

12:33.176 --> 12:35.209
We all promised
we weren't going to go.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.711
Oh, what a jerk.

12:36.713 --> 12:37.829
I know.

12:37.831 --> 12:39.931
I was hoping to go
without anyone finding out.

12:41.484 --> 12:43.234
Well, since Amy's going,
do you want me there?

12:43.236 --> 12:44.402
You know, to support you?

12:44.404 --> 12:45.687
Oh...

12:45.689 --> 12:47.238
that's nice,
but it-it's just gonna be

12:47.240 --> 12:48.890
a room full of boring old men

12:48.892 --> 12:50.692
and I'm not sure
how much help you'd be.

12:50.694 --> 12:52.226
Okay.

12:52.228 --> 12:54.529
I'm just gonna tie my shoe
while you think about that.

13:02.004 --> 13:03.499
Oh, yeah. No.
Thanks, that would

13:03.500 --> 13:05.499
be great help.

13:06.584 --> 13:07.951
You realize
you might kill some of them.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.421
Oh, then you <i>all</i> can get tenure.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.658
Come on, Daddy.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.829
All the other scientists
have seat warmers.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.848
This is so humiliating.

13:20.850 --> 13:23.634
I've got to get tenure.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.335
Okay, l-let's meet halfway.

13:25.337 --> 13:28.505
How about I cut my cleaning
lady down to twice a week?

13:29.566 --> 13:33.568
Looks like we're both going
to be living like animals.

13:36.071 --> 13:38.524
Let's go over our emotional
responses one last time.

13:38.525 --> 13:39.957
Okay.

13:39.959 --> 13:43.527
Professor Tupperman is dead,
and that makes us...?

13:43.529 --> 13:45.996
Sad.

13:45.998 --> 13:48.082
The fact that there
are so many people

13:48.084 --> 13:49.249
here tonight doesn't make us

13:49.251 --> 13:50.718
cranky and claustrophobic.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.702
It makes us...?

13:51.704 --> 13:54.054
Glad.

13:54.056 --> 13:57.474
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set
of <i>Roots</i> was...?

13:57.476 --> 13:59.710
Bad.

13:59.712 --> 14:01.712
However...
No.

14:01.714 --> 14:03.314
Fine. Bad.

14:04.182 --> 14:06.517
Unbelievable.

14:06.519 --> 14:08.268
You have some nerve
showing up here

14:08.270 --> 14:10.104
just to schmooze
with the tenure committee.

14:10.106 --> 14:11.188
You're here.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.606
Excuse me.

14:12.608 --> 14:14.775
I'm here to pay my respects
to Professor... Tupperware,

14:14.777 --> 14:16.110
or whatever his name is.

14:16.112 --> 14:17.328
So am I.

14:17.330 --> 14:20.164
His passing makes
me feel... bad.

14:23.451 --> 14:26.670
Well, well, well, Sheldon,
fancy meeting you here.

14:26.672 --> 14:28.539
I guess the train store
in Glendale

14:28.541 --> 14:30.624
wasn't having a cotillion
after all.

14:31.793 --> 14:34.328
And you-- you said
you weren't coming here, either.

14:34.330 --> 14:38.098
I have a thick accent.
You don't know what I said.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.134
I'd like to know
why Penny's here.

14:40.136 --> 14:42.919
I'm here to support
my man, just like you.

14:42.921 --> 14:44.471
What are you going to do?

14:44.473 --> 14:47.191
Take people's drink orders
and get them wrong?

14:48.043 --> 14:50.227
Do it.

15:04.108 --> 15:06.610
What? Did she do it yet?

15:09.113 --> 15:11.832
She plans on flirting with
members of the tenure committee

15:11.834 --> 15:13.884
to further
Leonard's cause.

15:13.886 --> 15:16.303
Well, that's a fine
how-do-you-do.

15:16.305 --> 15:18.672
Don't just stand there.
Take your breasts out.

15:22.143 --> 15:24.762
Ooh, meerkat fight!

15:25.981 --> 15:27.731
You're all
wasting your time.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.933
Sheldon is the most
qualified for the job,

15:29.935 --> 15:33.687
and no amount of gravity-defying
bosom's going to change that.

15:34.989 --> 15:36.306
Seriously, is that tape?

15:36.308 --> 15:38.442
Like, how are they
staying up like that?

15:38.444 --> 15:40.444
Way to hit 'em
with both barrels.

15:43.615 --> 15:45.949
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

15:45.951 --> 15:48.502
Using women to advance
your cause with sexuality,

15:48.504 --> 15:50.671
and whatever Amy plans on doing.

15:52.156 --> 15:53.064
Are you implying

15:53.065 --> 15:55.599
that my girlfriend has
no sexuality to exploit?

15:55.647 --> 15:56.401
Yes!

15:56.426 --> 15:58.129
Okay, because
that was not clear.

15:58.130 --> 15:59.296
Sheldon!

16:01.850 --> 16:03.383
What?

16:03.385 --> 16:04.852
That was ambiguous.

16:04.854 --> 16:07.554
Well, now it's biguous.
What are you gonna do about it?

16:07.556 --> 16:08.639
Um...

16:08.641 --> 16:09.940
You could talk some smack
about his mother.

16:09.942 --> 16:11.859
Well, yes, of course,
he wouldn't like that at all.

16:11.861 --> 16:14.144
Last night,

16:14.146 --> 16:16.313
I was feeling in need
of sexual release

16:16.315 --> 16:18.849
when I happened
to come across your mother.

16:20.318 --> 16:22.536
Okay, okay.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.037
Guys, what are we doing here?

16:24.039 --> 16:25.205
I don't know what you're doing,

16:25.207 --> 16:26.657
but I was about to insinuate

16:26.659 --> 16:30.127
that I had coitus
with Raj's mother for a dollar.

16:31.463 --> 16:32.963
Oh, you do
what you want,

16:32.965 --> 16:35.382
but I don't want to lose
my friends over tenure.

16:35.384 --> 16:36.500
Friends are forever.

16:36.502 --> 16:37.668
So is tenure.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.269
Walk!

16:40.505 --> 16:44.224
I'm just gonna go home and
let my work speak for itself.

16:44.226 --> 16:46.477
You're right.
This is beneath me.

16:46.479 --> 16:49.513
Like your mother was last night.

16:50.715 --> 16:52.683
How about it, Sheldon?

16:52.685 --> 16:56.219
What do you think
I should do?

16:56.221 --> 16:59.323
Well, you'll always be
an academic success,

16:59.325 --> 17:00.724
but...

17:00.726 --> 17:02.025
I seriously question

17:02.027 --> 17:04.227
whether you'll make
any more friends.

17:06.564 --> 17:08.832
I don't want any more,
but let's go.

17:10.285 --> 17:12.920
Are you kidding? I would
"wove" to baby-sit for you.

17:12.922 --> 17:15.172
I could not ask
you to do that.

17:15.174 --> 17:16.573
Nonsense.
Children "wove" me.

17:16.575 --> 17:19.675
Something about me just makes
them "waugh" and "waugh."

17:26.885 --> 17:29.520
No. We cannot lose
to that jerk.

17:29.522 --> 17:31.555
Yeah, screw it.

17:31.557 --> 17:32.773
I'm going in.

17:32.775 --> 17:34.257
You... Wait. Hold on.

17:34.259 --> 17:36.193
I believe "Screw it,
I'm going in" is what

17:36.195 --> 17:37.978
I said to your
mother last night.

17:40.198 --> 17:42.950
Don't worry, I didn't
really say that.

17:42.952 --> 17:44.701
I-I find the concept

17:44.703 --> 17:46.987
of coitus ridiculous
and off-putting.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.825
Should have taken my breasts out
while I had the chance.

18:01.466 --> 18:04.000
Mrs. Davis?

18:04.836 --> 18:06.420
Mrs. Davis?

18:06.422 --> 18:08.505
Mrs. Davis?

18:08.507 --> 18:10.373
I know you're in there.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.360
I saw your car
in the parking lot.

18:13.362 --> 18:15.545
What?

18:15.547 --> 18:18.381
I just found out
that you recommended myself,

18:18.383 --> 18:20.517
Dr. Hofstadter
and Dr. Koothrappali

18:20.519 --> 18:22.719
to be on the short list
for tenure.

18:22.721 --> 18:23.920
Well, despite your quirks,

18:23.922 --> 18:26.556
the three of you
are very accomplished

18:26.558 --> 18:28.208
in your respective fields.

18:28.210 --> 18:31.895
I don't know what you mean
by "quirks," but, um...

18:33.030 --> 18:34.411
...I do want
to express my gratitude.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.628
You didn't bring
another gift, did you?

18:35.653 --> 18:37.653
No, no.

18:37.736 --> 18:39.402
No, I learned my lesson.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.104
I understand
that was inappropriate.

18:41.106 --> 18:42.322
Good.

18:42.324 --> 18:44.658
Anyway, thank you.

18:44.660 --> 18:47.077
You're welcome.

18:53.668 --> 18:56.553
I'm gonna pretend
that didn't happen.

18:56.555 --> 18:58.054
Yeah, right on, sister.
