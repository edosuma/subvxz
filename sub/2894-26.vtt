WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:04.737
(rumbling)

00:04.739 --> 00:06.471
Captain america:
Think, cabal!

00:06.474 --> 00:10.109
The red skull, your
so-called leader,
abandoned you.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.777
And we just cleaned
your clocks.

00:11.779 --> 00:15.581
How about you avoid
further humiliation
and stand down?

00:15.583 --> 00:18.250
You think we'll just let you
haul us off to the vault?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.252
Iron man: Right now,
I'm more concerned

00:20.254 --> 00:22.021
About the guy running
around with my armor

00:22.023 --> 00:25.257
And the most powerful artifact
in the known universe.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.761
The tesseract! Without
it, this entire place
will collapse!

00:28.763 --> 00:31.764
(rumbling)

00:31.766 --> 00:33.399
(grunts)

00:33.401 --> 00:34.700
(metal clanking)

00:34.702 --> 00:38.070
Hyperion!

00:38.072 --> 00:39.738
(rumbling)

00:39.740 --> 00:42.241
(both groaning)

00:42.243 --> 00:44.743
Whoa! We're gettin'
sucked in here!

00:44.745 --> 00:46.712
(screams)
widow!

00:46.714 --> 00:51.517
(black widow grunts)

00:51.519 --> 00:53.552
(metal clanking)

00:53.554 --> 00:56.789
(screams)

00:56.791 --> 00:59.058
(grunts)

00:59.060 --> 01:00.592
(metal clanking)

01:00.594 --> 01:02.294
The skull!
(metal clanking)

01:02.296 --> 01:05.096
I'll crush his
shriveled red
cranium!

01:05.099 --> 01:07.733
Sounds like we all want
to bring the skull
down, m.O.D.O.K.

01:07.735 --> 01:14.740
Maybe that gives us
a mutual goal.

01:14.742 --> 01:18.744
And so much for the
spirit of cooperation.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.547
(explosion)

01:21.549 --> 01:23.482
(rumbling)

01:23.484 --> 01:38.230
(crashes)

01:38.232 --> 01:40.766
(rumbling)

01:40.768 --> 01:52.311
(screaming)

01:52.313 --> 01:54.480
This is awkward.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.815
Iron man: I didn't have time
to clean up or anything.

01:56.817 --> 01:57.816
Fool!

01:57.818 --> 02:00.285
You teleported them too?

02:00.287 --> 02:04.189
There was no time to reduce
the transport field, dracula!

02:04.191 --> 02:07.759
Or would you rather
I'd left half of your
miserable corpse behind?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.394
And why here?

02:09.395 --> 02:11.864
We need resources
to carry on.

02:11.866 --> 02:14.266
You would rely on them?

02:14.268 --> 02:16.668
Attuma will get
his own revenge!

02:16.670 --> 02:18.904
There's no way we'd team up
with the likes of you.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.506
Maybe we would.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.774
Check his head.
Must've hit it hard.

02:22.776 --> 02:22.774
Iron man: No, listen.

02:22.776 --> 02:27.246
This is a good time
for all of us to try
and work together.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.447
Hyperion:
Wrong!
Huh?

02:28.449 --> 02:38.323
It's a good time
for the avengers to fall.

02:38.325 --> 02:52.538
(grunts)

02:52.540 --> 02:55.707
Ha!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.776
That nanosecond-processor
brain of yours

02:57.778 --> 03:00.612
Could easily have teleported
the cabal and left us.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.947
What's your
game, m.O.D.O.K.?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.949
(groans)

03:03.951 --> 03:06.752
(grunts)

03:06.754 --> 03:07.853
(iron man grunts)

03:07.855 --> 03:09.888
Glad you rejoined
the team, tony.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.257
If you've got a game plan,
now's the time.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.660
We have to work
with the cabal, cap.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.329
It's the only chance we
have against the skull.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.698
I've tried teaming up
with the enemy before.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.201
It's a surefire way
to deep-six you
and your team.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.437
Yet who beamed us
out of there and
saved our skin?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.639
Now... (groans)

03:27.641 --> 03:29.341
Starting to feel
the shrapnel.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
Jarvis, activate
support systems.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.579
(iron man groans)
tony's chest unit
is damaged.

03:33.581 --> 03:40.352
Jarvis: <i> Replacement</i>
<i>parts already prepped.</i>

03:40.354 --> 03:41.553
(gasps)

03:41.555 --> 03:43.288
Oh, man!

03:43.290 --> 03:44.556
That's better.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.458
Now, to get you
into a spare suit.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.362
Sorry, cap. I used
every suit when we
attacked skull's base.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.431
Iron or no,
you're still the man.

03:52.433 --> 03:56.668
Sure. I'll go all
billionnaire philanthropist
on their butts.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.437
Billionaire genius
philanthropist!

03:58.439 --> 04:01.673
You'll think of something.

04:01.675 --> 04:10.249
Jarvis, I may have found
something to wear after all.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.617
Jarvis: <i> Transferring</i>
<i>power control.</i>

04:11.619 --> 04:13.285
(groans)

04:13.287 --> 04:15.387
What? (yells)

04:15.389 --> 04:19.423
(grunts)

04:19.426 --> 04:21.793
Iron man: <i> Who's up for</i>
<i>broiled halibut?</i>

04:21.795 --> 04:23.862
(machine whirring)

04:23.864 --> 04:25.797
(screams)

04:25.799 --> 04:28.867
(yells)

04:28.869 --> 04:36.041
(groans)

04:36.043 --> 04:37.976
(glass shattering)

04:37.978 --> 04:40.879
Why do we always end up
trapped in a horror movie?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.014
(both gasping)

04:42.016 --> 04:43.515
It's been too long

04:43.517 --> 04:46.785
Since I've feasted on
such healthy specimens.

04:46.787 --> 04:46.785
(both groaning)

04:46.787 --> 04:46.785
Iron man: <i> You're lookin'</i>
<i>a little pasty there, drac.</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:51.857
<i>What you need</i>
<i>is a good dose</i>
<i>of vitamin d.</i>

04:51.859 --> 04:54.326
(snarls)

04:54.328 --> 04:56.461
Not sure if I should
take credit for
that victory.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.963
But you will,
won't you?

04:57.965 --> 04:58.997
Probably.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.366
(growls)

05:01.368 --> 05:03.435
(grunts)

05:03.437 --> 05:07.339
(growls)

05:07.341 --> 05:10.942
(yells)

05:10.944 --> 05:16.948
(groans)

05:16.950 --> 05:19.918
Iron man: <i> Hey! Hey!</i>

05:19.920 --> 05:22.387
What is that
annoying sound?

05:22.389 --> 05:24.823
Don't know.
Your voice?

05:24.825 --> 05:24.823
Iron man: <i> Hey, muscle-head!</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:30.929
<i>I've remapped my suit's</i>
<i>anatomical controls</i>
<i>into the tower's systems.</i>

05:30.931 --> 05:34.833
<i>The entire tower</i>
<i>is my armor now.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:38.904
(grunts)

05:38.906 --> 05:40.806
Iron man: <i> That was me</i>
<i>moving my pinky.</i>

05:40.808 --> 05:44.943
(groans)

05:44.945 --> 05:47.779
<i>You don't want</i>
<i>to know what I did</i>
<i>to make that happen.</i>

05:47.781 --> 05:49.915
Jarvis: <i> No offense, sir,</i>
<i>but you're stealing my...</i>

05:49.917 --> 05:52.084
<i>I believe the term</i>
<i>is "shtick."</i>

05:52.086 --> 05:56.388
That was fun, but, jarvis,
can you get to work
on something a little more

05:56.390 --> 05:57.589
Outdoorsy?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.692
Jarvis: <i> Already done, sir.</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:01.860
Captain america:
<i>What's the status</i>
<i>of the cabal?</i>

06:01.862 --> 06:01.860
(screams)

06:01.862 --> 06:04.996
Hawkeye: <i> Fishface, uber-dweeb,</i>
<i>and the prince of dorkness</i>

06:04.998 --> 06:06.765
<i>Are on lockdown.</i>

06:06.767 --> 06:08.700
<i>We lost track of the</i>
<i>flying bobblehead.</i>

06:08.702 --> 06:11.737
I guess operation
"super-villain team-up"
is on hold.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.373
Split up and search the tower.
We need to find m.O.D.O.K.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.974
I already ran
a full sweep, cap.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.043
He's not in the tower.
Neither is widow.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.578
They're both gone?
Where?

06:19.580 --> 06:20.846
Scanning.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.914
But teleportation beams
are tough to track.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.982
Iron man: I'll locate
widow, sam.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.917
Right now, we have
a bigger problem.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.919
What's bigger than finding
a lost teammate?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.722
(rumbling)

06:30.724 --> 06:34.893
The skull is
attacking new york.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.129
Thor: <i> He possesses</i>
<i>the tesseract.</i>

06:37.131 --> 06:38.830
<i>He has access</i>
<i>to countless portals,</i>

06:38.832 --> 06:41.566
Cutting through
multiple dimensions.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.068
Captain america:
We'll send the team out
to take him down.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.003
Avengers, assemble!

06:45.005 --> 06:47.105
Iron man: He's also
attacking europe

06:47.107 --> 06:49.408
And asia and south america.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.476
Every major continent,
in fact.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.578
He's everywhere.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.013
Okay, I admit it.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.517
That's bad.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.986
Iron man: Operation
"earth's mightiest" is online.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.855
We've got clearance
from across the globe
to stop the skull.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.524
Okay, avenge-lings,

07:05.526 --> 07:07.092
Jarvis and I are
holding new york.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.895
You've been deployed
worldwide. Roll call.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.830
<i>Sydney, australia</i>
<i>reporting in.</i>

07:11.832 --> 07:14.599
(engines roaring)

07:14.601 --> 07:16.601
<i>Rio, brazil, check.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:19.204
(engines roaring)

07:19.206 --> 07:23.442
(growls)

07:23.444 --> 07:26.478
<i>I'm here.</i>
<i>Too much sand.</i>

07:26.480 --> 07:28.880
That'd be cairo,
egypt, hulk.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.882
<i>Flying high</i>
<i>over hong kong.</i>

07:30.884 --> 07:32.551
<i>Greetings from agnafit.</i>

07:32.553 --> 07:33.952
Iron man:
Stockholm, thor.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.122
It hasn't been called
"agnafit" since the norse age.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.224
Hawkeye: Tony, what
about black widow?

07:39.226 --> 07:41.960
Iron man: <i> No word. If</i>
<i>and when she shows up,</i>

07:41.962 --> 07:47.799
<i>I'm sticking her</i>
<i>with antarctica.</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:50.869
<i>So, everyone stay sharp</i>
<i>and stay in contact.</i>

07:50.871 --> 07:52.871
Skull thinks
by splitting us up
across the world,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.606
He can divide
and conquer.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.942
But be clear,
we may be separated,

07:56.944 --> 08:04.483
But the avengers
will never be divided.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.052
<i>So-called</i>
<i>leaders of the earth,</i>

08:07.054 --> 08:09.955
<i>I, the cosmic skull,</i>

08:09.957 --> 08:13.692
<i>Now wield the power</i>
<i>to match my ambition.</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:17.229
Surrender to
my eternal servitude!

08:17.231 --> 08:22.634
Any country that resists
will cease to exist!

08:22.636 --> 08:23.935
He's headed
to stockholm.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.038
Iron man: <i> Thor, you're up.</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:31.610
(grunts)

08:31.612 --> 08:34.246
How dare you attack
the fair city of agnafit!

08:34.248 --> 08:38.015
Have at thee!

08:38.018 --> 08:41.019
(red skull laughs maniacally)

08:41.020 --> 08:43.087
(grunts)

08:43.090 --> 08:46.057
(screams)

08:46.059 --> 08:47.993
Iron man:
<i>Watch it, hawkeye.</i>
<i>He's coming.</i>

08:47.995 --> 08:49.961
<i>Those hydras</i>
<i>might be empty armor,</i>

08:49.963 --> 08:52.697
<i>But they're a cosmic extension</i>
<i>of skull himself.</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:56.935
<i>He controls them</i>
<i>like puppets.</i>

08:56.937 --> 08:58.970
Hawkeye: Maybe we can
make him cry just a little

08:58.972 --> 09:10.215
When we break
all his toys.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.750
Hawkeye: Definitely not...

09:11.752 --> 09:13.885
(grunts)
...How I was picturing...

09:13.887 --> 09:17.889
(grunts)
...My first trip to rio.

09:17.891 --> 09:24.262
Iron man: <i> Heads up, cap.</i>
<i>Skull's down under.</i>

09:24.264 --> 09:25.997
Computer: <i> Malfunction.</i>

09:25.999 --> 09:35.840
Captain america: No problem.

09:35.842 --> 09:45.884
(roars)

09:45.886 --> 09:50.956
(roars)

09:50.958 --> 09:53.124
(grunts)

09:53.126 --> 10:01.032
Iron man: <i> Hulk,</i>
<i>he's on his way.</i>

10:01.034 --> 10:03.902
Hulk smash stupid,
flying, skull man!

10:03.904 --> 10:07.138
How very eloquent.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.875
(roars)

10:10.877 --> 10:15.714
(screams)

10:15.716 --> 10:18.984
Red skull: The power of
universe is at my command!

10:18.986 --> 10:22.854
And still you follow
these worthless heroes.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.857
You should
be worshipping me!
(laughs maniacally)

10:25.859 --> 10:28.059
<i>Is it me or is</i>
<i>skull losin' it?</i>

10:28.061 --> 10:30.862
<i>The tesseract is too much</i>
<i>for any mortal.</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:33.898
<i>Soon, he'll lose</i>
<i>every shred of vanity.</i>

10:33.900 --> 10:36.801
Skull, you can't control
that much power.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.771
It's clouding your already
deranged mind.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.841
I've never seen
more clearly.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.843
To start a new world,

10:44.845 --> 10:49.347
I must burn the old one
and its heroes,

10:49.349 --> 10:53.251
To the ground.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.987
Such surefire precision!

10:55.989 --> 10:59.024
And yet, how can a hawk
attack what it can't see?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.026
(screams)

11:01.028 --> 11:04.763
My eyes!
I'm blind!

11:04.765 --> 11:07.265
(sighs)
the other bird.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.901
I'm reminded
of the myth of icarus.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.871
He flew too close
to the sun,

11:12.873 --> 11:15.073
And his wings melted.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.307
(groans)

11:16.309 --> 11:17.709
(laughs maniacally)

11:17.711 --> 11:19.911
(screams)

11:19.913 --> 11:21.880
Red skull: What's the
inscription?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.882
"whosoever holds
this hammer,

11:23.884 --> 11:25.817
"if he be worthy,

11:25.819 --> 11:28.687
"shall possess
the power of thor."

11:28.689 --> 11:31.456
Mjolnir! No!

11:31.458 --> 11:32.924
(screams)

11:32.926 --> 11:36.961
It seems you are
not worthy after all.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.863
This ends now, skull!

11:38.865 --> 11:41.933
An unbreakable shield.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.203
A thorn in my side
for half a century.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.907
Do you know what happens
when the unstoppable force

11:48.909 --> 11:50.975
Meets the immovable object?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.310
(glass shattering)

11:52.312 --> 11:53.478
(groans)

11:53.480 --> 11:54.913
(screams)

11:54.915 --> 11:56.948
You're making me angry!

11:56.950 --> 12:00.318
Is it true, monster,
that the madder you get,

12:00.320 --> 12:02.220
The stronger you become?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.222
(roars)
red skull: Shall we find out?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.490
(groans)

12:05.492 --> 12:12.931
(screams)

12:12.933 --> 12:16.735
Red skull: But you avengers
must be so lonely.

12:16.737 --> 12:25.910
Let's reunite the team
for their final moments,
shall we?

12:25.912 --> 12:29.280
Here, where
it all began.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.183
Avengers, assemble.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.919
(all screaming)

12:34.921 --> 12:36.087
And perish!

12:36.089 --> 12:37.322
(screams)

12:37.324 --> 12:39.791
Hey, everyone,
just a quick f.Y.I.

12:39.793 --> 12:40.959
(chuckles)

12:40.961 --> 12:42.160
I'm blind as a bat.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.762
(groans)

12:43.764 --> 12:45.029
(crashes)

12:45.031 --> 12:47.332
Does hulk smell
angrier than usual?

12:47.334 --> 12:51.169
(roars)

12:51.171 --> 12:52.871
(grunts)

12:52.873 --> 12:52.871
(crashes)

12:52.873 --> 12:55.507
Do I want to know
what this looks like?

12:55.509 --> 12:57.308
You don't. Trust me.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.543
(screams)

12:58.545 --> 13:02.447
I'd planned on ripping you
atom from atom,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.916
But I must confess
a certain joy

13:04.918 --> 13:07.118
Of seeing you
torn apart

13:07.120 --> 13:09.120
By your own teammate.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.990
This kind of thing
happens way
too often.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.025
Tony, we need a plan.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.061
Iron man: <i> How's this?</i>
<i>You've got to</i>
<i>subdue the hulk.</i>

13:17.063 --> 13:19.330
Jarvis, light a fire under it.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.799
Jarvis: <i> Sorry, sir.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:23.001
<i>The damage impaired</i>
<i>my 3-d printers.</i>

13:23.003 --> 13:25.203
<i>Estimate armor completion</i>
<i>in two hours.</i>

13:25.205 --> 13:28.306
And I estimate world
destruction in one.
(grunts)

13:28.308 --> 13:30.475
Game plan's
out the window.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.877
Cap's gonna hate me
for this.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.345
<i>Howdy, gents.</i>

13:34.347 --> 13:37.448
<i>Thought you'd appreciate</i>
<i>seeing the fruits</i>
<i>of your labor.</i>

13:37.450 --> 13:41.386
<i>This is what the end</i>
<i>of everything looks like.</i>

13:41.388 --> 13:42.954
<i>Nice job.</i>

13:42.956 --> 13:45.557
<i>But this is your</i>
<i>chance to stop it.</i>

13:45.559 --> 13:46.991
<i>Help save the world</i>

13:46.993 --> 13:49.093
<i>Or be destroyed</i>
<i>with the rest of us.</i>

13:49.095 --> 13:51.262
<i>Your choice.</i>

13:51.264 --> 14:02.607
Stark, you are
indeed a fool.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.176
(roars)

14:05.178 --> 14:06.845
(rumbling)

14:06.847 --> 14:09.080
Avengers, as one!
Attack!

14:09.082 --> 14:11.416
(roars)

14:11.418 --> 14:13.885
(all groaning)

14:13.887 --> 14:19.424
Not to be negative,
but this really
couldn't get any worse.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.992
Hawkeye: I'm gonna
assume that it did.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.862
Hyperion: Greetings, losers.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.997
Tony, tell me
you're not that stupid.

14:25.999 --> 14:32.904
Oh, he most certainly is.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.472
Captain america:
<i>Tony, a cosmic skull</i>

14:34.474 --> 14:36.541
<i>And a rampaging hulk</i>
<i>weren't bad enough?</i>

14:36.543 --> 14:39.010
<i>You had to let the cabal</i>
<i>out of their cages too?</i>

14:39.012 --> 14:40.445
Iron man: Hey,
desperate times

14:40.447 --> 14:43.982
Call for one of tony's
genius ideas, remember?

14:43.984 --> 14:47.085
Easy for you to say.
You're not here.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.520
Falcon: Okay.
That's just creepy.

14:49.522 --> 14:49.520
Where are they?

14:49.522 --> 14:53.024
You have lasted longer
than I thought.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.260
I shall show you mercy

14:55.262 --> 14:58.930
By destroying you
here and now!

14:58.932 --> 15:01.032
(groans) what?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.934
Who would dare?

15:02.936 --> 15:05.003
The cabal dares!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.938
(groans)

15:06.940 --> 15:09.207
You have no honor, skull.
(groans)

15:09.209 --> 15:14.679
And you will pay
for this betrayal!

15:14.681 --> 15:17.115
(screams)

15:17.117 --> 15:20.184
(groans)

15:20.186 --> 15:21.286
(roars)

15:21.288 --> 15:23.588
Red skull: You
flatter yourselves.

15:23.590 --> 15:28.459
I shed you like
so much dead skin.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.029
(hulk roars)

15:31.031 --> 15:34.699
This is our chance
to eliminate them
once and for all.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.335
Fools! First the skull,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.705
Then the avengers.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.140
Iron man:
<i>Okay, avengers.</i>

15:42.142 --> 15:44.342
<i>The cabal bought you</i>
<i>some time.</i>

15:44.344 --> 15:44.342
You knew this
would happen.

15:44.344 --> 15:49.314
Iron man:
<i>Fighting each other is what</i>
<i>the cabal does best, cap.</i>

15:49.316 --> 15:51.149
(grunts)

15:51.151 --> 15:53.017
All right,
here's part two.

15:53.019 --> 15:53.017
Subdue the hulk.

15:53.019 --> 15:58.323
Iron man: <i> Thor, knock a little</i>
<i>asgardian sense into him.</i>

15:58.325 --> 16:01.459
<i>And cap, remind the hulk</i>
<i>who he is.</i>

16:01.461 --> 16:03.027
(yells)

16:03.029 --> 16:06.731
(rumbling)

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
(grunts)

16:08.401 --> 16:09.968
(groans)
stand down, avenger!

16:09.970 --> 16:11.302
That is an order!

16:11.304 --> 16:14.205
(roars)

16:14.207 --> 16:16.607
I said, "stand down, soldier!"

16:16.609 --> 16:19.077
(grunts)
huh? Cap?

16:19.079 --> 16:23.214
I can handle hulk now.
You deal with the skull.

16:23.216 --> 16:27.618
(all screaming)

16:27.620 --> 16:29.320
Amusing,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.989
That this entire attack

16:30.991 --> 16:33.291
Amounts to exactly nothing.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.159
Hawk, hang on!

16:35.161 --> 16:36.995
(grunts)

16:36.997 --> 16:39.030
(screaming)

16:39.032 --> 16:39.030
Hello!

16:39.032 --> 16:43.501
But I turned you into
a mindless beast!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.703
(grunts)

16:45.705 --> 16:48.573
(groans)

16:48.575 --> 16:51.042
But even you can't
touch his heart.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.110
(grunts)

16:52.112 --> 16:59.417
And his heart
is 100% avenger.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.719
Iron man: <i> Hey, guys,</i>
<i>I've got someone on the line</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:03.654
<i>Who wants to add</i>
<i>to the fun.</i>

17:03.656 --> 17:05.490
Black widow: <i> Sounds like</i>
<i>I'm missing a good time.</i>

17:05.492 --> 17:08.326
Widow, where are you?
Wait, don't tell me.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.294
It's...
Black widow and falcon:
Classified.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.396
Black widow:
<i>A little private time</i>
<i>with m.O.D.O.K.</i>

17:12.398 --> 17:13.765
<i>At a top secret</i>
<i>s.H.I.E.L.D. Facility,</i>

17:13.767 --> 17:16.367
<i>And I got all the intel</i>
<i>I needed.</i>

17:16.368 --> 17:18.703
There's a way to disrupt
the skull's portals.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.172
I'm uploading the intel
to your data cards now.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.342
Black widow: The processor
will reconfigure hawkeye's
disrupter arrowheads.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.310
(red skull laughs maniacally)

17:26.311 --> 17:31.049
Falcon, get me up there.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.350
I thought
you couldn't see.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.752
Say when.

17:34.754 --> 17:40.358
When!

17:40.360 --> 17:49.067
What?
Impossible!

17:49.069 --> 17:53.071
You did this!

17:53.073 --> 17:54.305
(both grunting)

17:54.307 --> 17:56.741
(captain america yells)

17:56.743 --> 18:04.849
What? You think that's
the first triangular shield
I've ever had?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.851
(grunts)

18:06.853 --> 18:07.752
(groans)

18:07.754 --> 18:09.253
I've got his arm!

18:09.255 --> 18:11.089
Of course, you
do, weakling.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.758
The legs are much
harder to hold.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.494
Your soul is
mine, skull.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.797
For your betrayal,
you shall forever be a slave

18:19.799 --> 18:22.834
To the king of darkness.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.535
(snarls)

18:24.537 --> 18:26.838
That's not how
we do things.

18:26.840 --> 18:31.409
If this is my end,
it will also be yours!

18:31.411 --> 18:38.883
Avengers!

18:38.885 --> 18:41.819
I wouldn't have
hesitated to
bite you.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.888
And still you saved me.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.823
Why?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.892
Because that is how
we do things.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.294
Red skull: You think
you've stopped me?

18:50.296 --> 18:53.131
You've merely
prolonged your agony.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.700
I've evolved beyond
the need...

18:55.702 --> 18:57.235
(rumbling)

18:57.237 --> 19:02.140
No! No!

19:02.142 --> 19:04.609
You? How?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.345
You should never
have double-crossed me.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.614
I gave you that armor.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.849
I can take it away.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.619
So can I.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.753
(sniffs)
whoo!

19:15.755 --> 19:15.753
Next time you borrow
my clothes,

19:15.755 --> 19:20.491
Can you run them
to the dry cleaner
before you give them back?

19:20.493 --> 19:23.261
(groans)

19:23.263 --> 19:26.764
Stark and I needed you
to focus all your energy

19:26.766 --> 19:29.433
On the cabal
and the avengers.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.170
That allowed m.O.D.O.K. Here
to get past your defenses

19:32.172 --> 19:33.905
And use his
technopathic abilities

19:33.907 --> 19:35.907
To remove my armor.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.209
This is the power!

19:38.211 --> 19:40.444
The armor is nothing!

19:40.446 --> 19:43.581
I'm going to obliterate
you all.

19:43.583 --> 19:50.755
Starting with iron man.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.925
Nothing is beyond me!

19:53.927 --> 19:56.294
Foolish would-be tyrant!

19:56.296 --> 19:59.397
You've already
forgotten something!

19:59.399 --> 20:03.834
(groans)

20:03.836 --> 20:09.941
(screaming)

20:09.943 --> 20:12.510
What now? We
gonna duke it out?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.812
As new leader
of the cabal,

20:14.814 --> 20:17.949
I say the avengers
will be destroyed...

20:17.951 --> 20:27.358
Another day.

20:27.360 --> 20:32.230
Hey, everyone,
I can see again!

20:32.232 --> 20:34.799
(unenthusiastically)
yeah, I'm thrilled too.

20:34.801 --> 20:38.869
Look, I know
I'll regret feeding
the tony stark ego machine,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.805
But nicely done.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.507
You led the team from here
without your armor.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.776
You finagled the cabal
to work with us.

20:45.778 --> 20:45.776
That's real leadership.

20:45.778 --> 20:51.582
Just between us, there's
no better role model
than captain america.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.584
But all the leadership
in the world

20:53.586 --> 20:55.953
Means squat
without a good team.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.856
And we have the best team
in this dimension.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.459
Hawkeye: When you're done
with the pep talk,
answer me one thing.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.362
If you weren't the one
who convinced
no-neck to break ranks,

21:04.364 --> 21:05.763
Then what's widow been up to?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.831
Where is she?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.499
Like she said,

21:08.501 --> 21:11.469
Captain america and iron man:
It's classified.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.538
Black widow: The skull is
in one of those dimensions,
director fury.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.474
And so is the tesseract.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.942
Let's hope
we find him first.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.812
Before someone worse does.

21:21.814 --> 21:27.485
Red skull: Master.

21:27.487 --> 21:27.518
As you desired, thanos.
