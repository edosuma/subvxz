WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:06.180
KNOWING HOW UNTRAINED
AND UNTETHERED MAGIC

00:06.354 --> 00:08.138
COULD LEAD TO DISASTER,

00:08.312 --> 00:11.228
THE ONE IN ATLANTIS
BEING THE PRIME EXAMPLE,

00:11.402 --> 00:15.450
THE ELDERS KNEW THAT THEY
NEEDED TO NURTURE YOUNG MAGIC.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.716
THE ELDERS KNEW THEY NEEDED
TO NURTURE YOUNG MAGIC.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.457
BILLIE.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.328
BILLIE, ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

00:24.502 --> 00:26.113
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
UNTETHERED MAGIC,

00:26.287 --> 00:28.202
ELDERS,
YADA, YADA, YADA.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.856
OK, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE OVER THE FIGHT
FOR THE GREATER GOOD,

00:31.031 --> 00:32.771
I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA

00:32.945 --> 00:35.818
IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY
OF GOOD MAGIC.

00:35.992 --> 00:38.125
LISTEN, PAIGE
WANTED ME TO TEACH YOU
SOMETHING GOOD,

00:38.299 --> 00:40.997
AND I THINK YOU'RE KINDA
MAKING ME LOOK BAD
RIGHT NOW.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.173
OH, COME ON. YOU COULD BE
TEACHING ME TIC-TAC-TOE.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
SHE WOULDN'T CARE.

00:45.045 --> 00:45.958
SHE'S JUST HAPPIER GETTING ME
OFF HER BACK FOR THE DAY.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.309
OK. SO,
THE MAGICAL COMMUNITY

00:48.483 --> 00:51.225
KNEW IT NEEDED A PLACE
TO NURTURE YOUNG MAGIC,

00:51.399 --> 00:53.923
SO THE ELDERS CREATED
MAGIC SCHOOL.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.274
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
IMAGINING A BUNCH OF
OLD FARTS IN ROBES

00:57.448 --> 00:59.842
LECTURING ON THE MORAL
IMPLICATIONS OF MAGIC.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.236
THERE'S THAT.
THERE'S ALSO
ADVANCED COURSES

01:02.410 --> 01:05.369
IN TELEKINESIS,
SPELL CASTING,
POTION MAKING--

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
WAIT. WHAT?ASTRAL PROJECTION,

01:07.502 --> 01:09.504
AND MEDIEVAL WEAPONRY.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.114
THEY REALLY
TEACH THAT STUFF?

01:13.638 --> 01:14.813
[GASPS]

01:14.987 --> 01:16.728
THIS IS SO COOL!

01:21.385 --> 01:23.735
OH, SORRY.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.044
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:24.840 --> 02:26.755
OW!

02:28.887 --> 02:31.847
OK. EITHER THERE IS
A GREMLIN INFESTATION
IN THIS HOUSE,

02:32.021 --> 02:33.327
OR WYATT'S LITTLE
ORBY FINGERS

02:33.501 --> 02:35.242
HAVE GOTTEN A HOLD
OF MY JEWELRY.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.896
JEWELS THIS, UH,
EARLY IN THE MORNING?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.333
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
[GROANS] I HAVE
A COFFEE DATE,

02:41.639 --> 02:43.337
AND I'M TRYING
TO GET OUT OF HERE

02:43.511 --> 02:44.599
BEFORE LEO CHANGES
HIS MIND ABOUT
TRAINING BILLIE.

02:44.773 --> 02:45.861
Wyatt: AH YAH!

02:46.035 --> 02:48.864
OH, NICE TRY,
LITTLE PIRATE.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.214
I SEE WHAT
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.260
THANKS A LOT, MATEY.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.088
OH, WYATT, HONEY!
MOMMY SAID NO MAGIC.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.481
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
YOU ARE MORE WORRIED

02:57.655 --> 02:59.483
ABOUT HIM USING MAGIC

02:59.657 --> 03:02.051
THAN YOU ARE ABOUT
HIM, UH, STEALING.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.185
ACTUALLY, I'M MORE CONCERNED
WITH HIM BLOWING OUR COVER

03:05.359 --> 03:06.969
WITH HIS SCHOOL PLAY
COMING UP.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.710
NOT YOUR CUP
OF TEA, HUH?

03:08.884 --> 03:12.279
NO, I'M JUST A LITTLE
OUT OF PRACTICE, THANK YOU.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.934
YEAH, WELL, ME, TOO.
HENCE THE...MORNING DATE.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.501
OK, HERE'S MY PROBLEM.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.765
DO I PICK A LIPSTICK COLOR
TO GO WITH MY FACE...

03:20.939 --> 03:22.767
OR MY ALIAS' FACE?

03:22.941 --> 03:25.161
WELL...

03:25.335 --> 03:27.946
SEEING AS WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN SEE THE REAL YOU,

03:28.120 --> 03:31.211
I'D GO WITH...PINK.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.303
AWW.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.262
I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT
LIKING THIS WHOLE...

03:39.436 --> 03:40.959
"NEW YOU" THING.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.352
NO.

03:42.526 --> 03:45.529
I GUESS I JUST MISS
THE OLD ME A LITTLE.

03:45.703 --> 03:49.098
UH, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
ONLINE DATING THING ANYWAY?

03:49.272 --> 03:50.491
YOU GET ASKED OUT
ALL THE TIME.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.101
NOT ANYMORE,

03:52.275 --> 03:54.059
NOT WITH ME HAVING TO DEAL
WITH BILLIE ALL THE TIME.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
BESIDES, IT'S NOT
ANY RISKIER

03:56.410 --> 03:58.412
THAN WHAT PHOEBE'S
DOING, RIGHT?

03:58.586 --> 03:59.804
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:59.978 --> 04:01.676
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
CHARTS SHE LOOKS AT

04:01.850 --> 04:04.809
TO SEE IF DEX IS THE FATHER
OF HER FUTURE CHILD.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.115
HE'S STILL A PLAYER.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.725
OH, PAIGE--

04:07.899 --> 04:08.900
WHAT? IT'S TRUE.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.206
EVEN HER OWN NEWSPAPER

04:10.380 --> 04:11.468
WRITES ABOUT IT
IN THE GOSSIP COLUMN.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.383
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT,

04:13.557 --> 04:16.517
BUT IN THE INTEREST
OF SISTERLY HARMONY,
I WOULD REALLY--

04:16.691 --> 04:18.606
HEY, GUYS. DID YOU HEAR
THE GOOD NEWS?

04:18.780 --> 04:20.564
HMM. LET ME GUESS.
DEX IS THE ONE?

04:20.738 --> 04:23.698
YEP, ACCORDING
TO EVERY MAGICAL
CALCULATION THERE IS.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.221
UH-HUH!

04:25.395 --> 04:27.005
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT
ALL TIMES OUT PERFECTLY,

04:27.179 --> 04:28.398
YOU KNOW, MY VISION
OF US GETTING MARRIED,

04:28.572 --> 04:29.530
WHEN I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET PREGNANT,

04:29.704 --> 04:30.574
ALL OF IT.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.228
HE'S THE ONE.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.274
YEAH. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
CHECK THAT ONE MORE TIME.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.667
I'M SORRY?

04:36.841 --> 04:39.627
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS SNAZZY COSTUME?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.237
[LAUGHS]

04:43.718 --> 04:45.372
COME ON, SWEETIE.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.808
DON'T YOU WANNA BE
ONE OF CINDERELLA'S
FOOTMEN?

04:46.982 --> 04:49.550
OK. HANG ON A SECOND.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.899
COME ON. WHAT'S WRONG?

04:51.073 --> 04:52.901
IT'S A GOOD COSTUME.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.817
LOOK. IT'S SHINY.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.949
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

04:58.123 --> 04:59.386
THERE YOU GO.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.126
DON'T MAKE SAD FACES.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.217
HI, CUTIE-PIE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:05.392 --> 05:06.480
I DON'T KNOW.

05:06.654 --> 05:07.785
HE'S NEVER USUALLY
LIKE THIS.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.178
HE JUST HATES IT.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.745
MAYBE HE'S ALLERGIC
TO THE FABRIC.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.834
OR SOMETHING
COULD BE STICKING HIM.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.096
A PIN?
A NEEDLE MAYBE?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.054
OH, NO, NO.
I CHECKED IT.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.058
OH, THAT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN IN THERE.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.104
REALLY. HE TRIED IT ON
BEFORE AND WAS FINE.

05:22.278 --> 05:25.847
IT'S OK. YOU'RE DOING
THE BEST YOU CAN,

05:26.021 --> 05:27.457
NOT BEING HIS
REAL MOM AND ALL.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.591
YOU'RE A DISTANT
COUSIN, RIGHT?

05:30.765 --> 05:33.768
OH, WE'RE A LITTLE BIT
CLOSER THAN YOU THINK.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.813
WELL, ISN'T THAT
GOOD TO KNOW.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.250
HERE.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.774
HOW'S THE OTHER
COSTUME COMING?

05:39.948 --> 05:41.602
UH...THE OTHER...

05:41.776 --> 05:43.125
THE PUMPKIN?

05:43.299 --> 05:45.388
IT WAS ON THE INFO SHEET
I SENT OUT.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.435
THE OTHER COSTUME.
RIGHT!

05:48.609 --> 05:50.611
UHH...IT'S ALL SEWN UP.

05:50.785 --> 05:54.136
GREAT. AS LONG AS IT LOOKS
LIKE THE OTHER BOYS'.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.921
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS
CAN TEASE.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.270
OK, WYATT.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.229
LET'S GO WORK ON
THAT FOREST SCENE, OK?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.274
LET'S GO.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.233
[SIGHS]

06:14.156 --> 06:15.766
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.595
SHH.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.436
LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING,

06:33.610 --> 06:34.959
BUT YOUR PICTURE
ON THE DATING SIGHT

06:35.133 --> 06:36.744
DIDN'T DO YOU JUSTICE.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.094
THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

06:42.793 --> 06:43.881
SO, TELL ME WHAT YOU DO

06:44.055 --> 06:45.317
THAT KEEPS YOU
SO CRAZY BUSY.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.103
OH, DID I SAY THAT I WAS?

06:48.277 --> 06:50.279
NO. BUT I SENSE
YOU'RE LIKE ME,

06:50.453 --> 06:51.672
OLD-FASHIONED
AT HEART,

06:51.846 --> 06:53.804
NOT ONE TO DO
THE ONLINE
DATING THING,

06:53.978 --> 06:55.676
BUT TOO SWAMPED
TO MEET PEOPLE
ANY OTHER WAY.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.418
YEAH. WELL,
YOU COULD SAY I...

06:58.592 --> 07:01.986
HAVEN'T HAD A NORMAL LIFE
IN A WHILE, BUT, UH...

07:02.160 --> 07:03.727
I THINK THAT
COULD BE CHANGING.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.033
GOOD.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.121
[LAUGHS]

07:06.295 --> 07:08.079
SO, UH...
WHAT DO YOU DO?

07:08.253 --> 07:11.343
WELL, UH, I TEACH--
ER, I TAUGHT.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.649
KIND OF, UM...

07:12.823 --> 07:15.739
AT A SPECIAL-NEEDS SCHOOL,
IF YOU WILL.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.567
I, UH,
TUTOR ONE-ON-ONE NOW.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.961
THE GIRL'S A REAL
PAIN IN THE BUTT.
LET ME TELL--

07:20.135 --> 07:21.919
OK. OVERSHARING.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.792
UM, WHAT DO YOU DO?

07:24.966 --> 07:26.315
OK. WELL, UH--

07:26.489 --> 07:28.752
HUH. WHERE TO START?

07:28.926 --> 07:30.667
I FIND THE MOST
EXCITING THING ABOUT
MARKET RESEARCH

07:30.841 --> 07:32.103
IS THE VARIETY.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.149
I MEAN, THE ARENAS
WE INTERFACE WITH,

07:34.323 --> 07:36.238
WHETHER IT BE
THE JOB'S PHARMACEUTICAL
VALIDATION

07:36.412 --> 07:38.719
OR QUALIFICATION,
FDA COMPLIANCE,

07:38.893 --> 07:40.416
INFO-TECH, YOU NAME IT.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.766
THE FIRST THING WE DO
IS WE GET A DATABASE
IN ORDER.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.681
UH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH, BLAH-BLAH.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.162
BLAH, BLAH-BLAH-BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH-BLAH.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.469
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH, BLAH-BLAH.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.471
BLAH, BLAH-BLAH-BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.473
BLAH-BLAH-BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH, BLAH-BLAH...

07:53.647 --> 07:55.083
DEX?

07:55.257 --> 07:56.954
BLAH-BLAH-BLAH...

07:57.128 --> 07:58.652
HEY, BABE.
HEY.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.610
BLAH, BLAH-BLAH, BLAH.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.133
BLAH, BLAH-BLAH, BLAH.
BLAH-BLAH, BLAH-BLAH.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.526
BLAH, BLAH-BLAH,
BLAH-BLAH.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.268
BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.922
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH-BLAH--BLAH.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.233
SO I'M FINE WITH COLOR,
BUT IF YOU CAN SEE IF JESS

08:15.407 --> 08:18.019
CAN FIT ME IN FOR
A QUICK CUT AFTER MY LEG WAX,

08:18.193 --> 08:19.542
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.588
SURE. UH, DO YOU WANT ME
TO PICK UP SOME CANDLES?

08:21.762 --> 08:23.111
YOU KNOW,
SET THE MOOD?

08:23.285 --> 08:25.374
OHH! GREAT IDEA. YEAH.
MAKE IT A COUPLE OF DOZEN.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.158
THANKS.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.076
HEY THERE.
BAD TIME?

08:32.250 --> 08:34.078
HI. NO, I'M JUST
GETTING READY

08:34.252 --> 08:35.645
FOR MY BIG DATE
WITH DEX TOMORROW.

08:35.819 --> 08:36.951
OHH.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.474
HEY. WEREN'T YOU ON A DATE?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.563
EGH. YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

08:40.737 --> 08:43.087
OH. I KNOW. IT'S HARD.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.308
I JUST GOT REALLY LUCKY THAT
DEX SHOWED UP AT MY FUNERAL.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.092
YEAH. RIGHT.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.137
YOU'VE KNOW HIM
FOR, WHAT,

08:49.311 --> 08:50.442
ALL OF A FEW WEEKS NOW?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.053
YEAH. IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE, ISN'T IT?

08:52.227 --> 08:54.185
YEAH. I MEAN, HOW WELL
DO YOU REALLY KNOW HIM?

08:54.359 --> 08:57.275
CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT
OF TIME YOU'VE ACTUALLY
SPENT TOGETHER.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.278
PAIGE, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

09:00.452 --> 09:01.802
NOWHERE.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.151
I SWEAR.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.849
OK. WELL, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.460
I DIDN'T LIKE RICHARD.
YOU DIDN'T LIKE COLE.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.506
BUT WE PROMISED
EACH OTHER

09:10.680 --> 09:13.204
THAT WE'D STAY OUT OF
EACH OTHER'S LOVE LIVES, RIGHT?

09:13.378 --> 09:14.510
OK. JUST ANSWER ME THIS.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.860
HOW WELL DO YOU
REALLY KNOW HIM?

09:17.034 --> 09:18.688
[SIGHS] PAIGE,
PLEASE DON'T START.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.734
WOULD IT KILL YOU JUST
TO SLOW THINGS DOWN?

09:20.908 --> 09:21.996
YOU KNOW, A SMIDGE?

09:22.170 --> 09:23.824
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
SLOW THINGS DOWN,

09:23.998 --> 09:25.434
BECAUSE OF MY PREMONITIONS.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.740
THEY'RE NOT
ALWAYS LITERAL.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.524
BUT I STILL HAVE TO
HONOR THEM, DON'T I?

09:28.698 --> 09:29.656
BUT LOOK--

09:29.830 --> 09:31.440
HONEY, I REALLY LIKE HIM,

09:31.614 --> 09:33.050
AND I REALLY
CARE ABOUT HIM,

09:33.224 --> 09:35.531
AND HE REALLY
CARES ABOUT ME, OK?

09:35.705 --> 09:37.881
SO DON'T WORRY, OK?

09:38.055 --> 09:42.190
NO, IT'S NOT OK.

09:49.850 --> 09:50.807
Leo: PIPER!

09:55.464 --> 09:58.075
LOOK, I'M A LITTLE
BEHIND IN THE CRAFTY
DEPARTMENT, OK?

09:58.249 --> 09:59.686
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO HONE MY SKILLS

09:59.860 --> 10:02.514
WITH A DEMON ATTACKING
EVERY 5 MINUTES.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.777
IT'S STILL NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.822
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.477
WHILE OF THOSE OTHER
MOTHERS WERE OUT THERE
MAKING CUTESY COSTUMES,

10:08.651 --> 10:10.348
I HAD MY NOSE
IN THIS BOOK,

10:10.522 --> 10:13.525
SO THIS BOOK
IS GONNA HELP ME MAKE
A DAMN CUTE PUMPKIN OUTFIT.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.006
WHAT'S UP?

10:16.180 --> 10:17.704
OH, YOU KNOW, JUST
UM, SOAKING UP KNOWLEDGE.

10:17.878 --> 10:18.705
I'M A VIRTUAL SPONGE.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.185
GOOD. KEEP IT UP.

10:21.359 --> 10:25.276
SO, YOU KNOW, HON,
BESIDES PERSONAL GAIN,
THERE--

10:25.450 --> 10:26.321
WHY ARE YOU SO SWEATY?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.410
OH. YOU KNOW,
THOSE, UM--

10:28.584 --> 10:32.196
THESE SALEM WITCH HUNTS,
AND THE--THE LYING
AND THE BURNING.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.502
IT'S JUST--
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.808
WELL, NOW THAT
I'M ALL CAUGHT UP,

10:34.982 --> 10:35.896
HOW ABOUT WE HOP ON OVER
TO MAGIC SCHOOL

10:36.070 --> 10:37.245
AND GET SOME
REAL EDUCATION?

10:37.419 --> 10:38.594
OK, WE CAN'T,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

10:38.768 --> 10:40.509
MAGIC SCHOOL BEING
THE HUB OF GOOD MAGIC,

10:40.683 --> 10:42.903
YOU KNOW,
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO EXPOSE OURSELVES.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.514
OH. AND WHAT IS
YOUR WIFE DOING?

10:45.688 --> 10:48.604
MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME.
NOW ZIP IT!

10:48.778 --> 10:53.478
ACTUALLY, SHE IS NOT
GONNA USE MAGIC TO MAKE
WYATT A COSTUME.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.350
OH, NO? WATCH ME!

10:55.524 --> 10:56.830
YOU WANTED
A NORMAL LIFE, REMEMBER?

10:57.004 --> 10:58.658
OK, LOOK, THAT WAS
BEFORE I REALIZED

10:58.832 --> 11:00.747
OUR SON WAS
GONNA BE HUMILIATED

11:00.921 --> 11:02.792
IN FRONT OF
HIS ENTIRE CLASS.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.751
OH, YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

11:04.925 --> 11:05.926
IT JUST MADE ME STRONGER.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.797
AND SHUT IT!

11:07.971 --> 11:10.713
OK, IS THIS ABOUT
WYATT'S HUMILIATION
OR YOURS?

11:10.887 --> 11:13.847
NO, IT'S ABOUT WYATT
AND THE PAGEANT AND--

11:14.021 --> 11:16.066
AND YOU OUTDOING MANDI?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.636
FINE.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.987
NO MAGIC.

11:24.161 --> 11:27.904
BUT I WILL STILL
MAKE THE BEST DAMN
PUMPKIN OUTFIT EVER,

11:28.078 --> 11:31.342
AND THAT WOMAN WILL BE
SORRY SHE TANGLED WITH ME.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.477
THAT IS ONE
DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.659
WELL?

11:45.835 --> 11:48.620
I'M BEGINNING
TO GAIN THE BOY'S TRUST.

11:48.795 --> 11:52.886
ONCE HE KNOWS IT'S SAFE
TO USE HIS POWERS AROUND ME--

11:53.060 --> 11:54.583
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.803
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
THIS CLEANED DAYS AGO.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.109
YEAH, WELL...

11:59.283 --> 12:00.154
IT WASN'T AS EASY
AS WE THOUGHT.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.459
IT'S A LOT MORE
TRASHED--

12:01.633 --> 12:02.591
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE EXCUSES,

12:02.765 --> 12:04.506
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

12:09.685 --> 12:12.296
WE NEED TO CREATE
A COMFORTABLE PLACE
FOR THE BOY,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.603
A FAMILIAR PLACE,

12:14.777 --> 12:18.389
OR ELSE HE'LL NEVER DO
WHAT I WANT HIM TO DO.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.885
DON'T LET
THAT THING DIE,

12:36.059 --> 12:40.585
NOT UNTIL AFTER
I'M DONE USING IT
TO GET WYATT.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.769
OK, HONEY, I KNOW
THIS IS NOT THE MORNING
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,

12:49.943 --> 12:51.553
BUT THE COFFEE MAKER'S
ON THE FRITZ.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.337
OH, THAT'S OK.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.817
DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE YOU
SOME TEA INSTEAD?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.732
TEA?
YEAH,
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.168
I WAS JUST
CLEANING UP.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.257
WELL, YOU ARE IN
A SURPRISINGLY CHIPPER MOOD

13:00.431 --> 13:02.346
FOR SOMEONE WHO HASN'T
SLEPT ALL NIGHT.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.436
WELL, I HAD TO FINISH
WYATT'S PUMPKIN COSTUME,
DIDN'T I?

13:05.610 --> 13:06.873
AND DID YOU FINISH?ABSOLUTELY.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.178
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY
BEING A SUPER MOM

13:08.352 --> 13:10.006
CAN BE SURPRISINGLY
SATISFYING.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.704
DON'T FORGET. YOU'RE REALLY
HIS SUPER LEGAL GUARDIAN.

13:12.879 --> 13:13.923
YES!

13:14.097 --> 13:15.316
AND ARE THERE
ANY OTHER SOFT SPOTS

13:15.490 --> 13:16.839
YOU'D LIKE TO POKE AT
WHILE YOU'RE HERE?

13:17.013 --> 13:19.276
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.279
OH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

13:22.453 --> 13:25.239
I THINK AT LEAST
WYATT KNOWS WHO
HIS MOTHER REALLY IS.

13:25.413 --> 13:28.068
OF COURSE HE DOES.
HE SEES YOU AS PIPER.
WE ALL DO.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.983
YEAH, BUT IT'S GOTTA BE
CONFUSING FOR HIM,

13:30.157 --> 13:33.551
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE
ALL OF HIS CLASSMATES
THINK I'M HIS COUSIN,

13:33.725 --> 13:35.945
HIS DISTANT COUSIN.

13:36.119 --> 13:39.079
LOOK, HE'S JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GET USED TO
THE WAY THINGS ARE.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.776
HEY.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.257
YOU WANNA HEAR MY PLAN
ON HOW TO SAVE PHOEBE FROM DEX?

13:43.431 --> 13:44.736
AH, COME ON, PAIGE.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.608
DO WE REALLY NEED THIS
IN OUR LIVES RIGHT NOW?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.263
DO WE REALLY NEED OUR SISTER
MARRYING A CHEATER?

13:49.437 --> 13:52.570
WELL, IT WAS
JUST A KISS, RIGHT?

13:52.744 --> 13:54.572
SO MAYBE IT WAS
HIS SISTER?

13:54.746 --> 13:56.096
EWW. THAT'S DISGUSTING.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.359
SISTERS DON'T KISS
BROTHERS LIKE THAT.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.143
PAIGE--

14:00.317 --> 14:02.363
LOOK, ALL I'M GONNA DO
IS FIND OUT WHO SHE REALLY IS.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.104
PHOEBE'S NEVER
GONNA KNOW.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.367
SHE'S GONNA KILL YA.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.847
SHE'S GONNA THANK ME.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.500
ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.806
HAVE A GREAT TIME
AT THE PLAY.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.939
THANKS.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.638
HA HA!

14:16.812 --> 14:18.858
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?

14:33.524 --> 14:35.787
WE'RE CLOSE.

14:38.834 --> 14:42.533
PRETTY ELABORATE RITUAL
YOU GOT US DOING HERE.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.709
WHEN DO I GET TO KNOW WHO
YOU'RE PLANNING TO CONJURE?

14:44.884 --> 14:45.928
YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.712
ACTUALLY,
I THINK I DO,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.627
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M THE ONLY ONE

14:49.801 --> 14:51.891
WHO KNOWS HOW TO BRING BACK
A DEMON FROM THE WASTELAND.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.501
IF YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE,

14:53.675 --> 14:55.677
I WOULDN'T NEED THE BOY,
NOW WOULD I?

14:58.854 --> 15:00.900
WHY DO YOU NEED HIM?

15:01.074 --> 15:02.771
WHAT DOES HE OFFER?

15:02.945 --> 15:06.644
HE OFFERS...POWER,

15:06.818 --> 15:09.082
A POWER NEITHER
YOU OR I POSSESS,

15:09.256 --> 15:11.084
A POWER
I'M GOING TO NEED

15:11.258 --> 15:14.914
IF I'M GOING TO
BRING BACK THE DEMON
I HAVE IN MIND.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.133
TEMPUS?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.874
BARBAS?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.139
ZANKOU?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.532
WHEN IT'S TIME--
NOW...

15:24.706 --> 15:25.837
OR I STOP
WHAT I'M DOING.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.622
YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.711
NO. I JUST THINK
I HAVE THE RIGHT

15:29.885 --> 15:32.844
TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH, THAT'S ALL,

15:33.019 --> 15:34.934
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THE INHERENT RISK INVOLVED

15:35.108 --> 15:37.327
WITH KIDNAPPING THE SON
OF A CHARMED ONE.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.286
I'M NOT KIDNAPPING HIM.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.157
I'M OFFERING HIM
A NEW HOME,

15:41.331 --> 15:46.554
A FAMILY,
A PLACE TO EXPRESS
HIS FULL POTENTIAL.

15:46.728 --> 15:50.384
EVEN IF YOU LURE HIM
IN HERE,

15:50.558 --> 15:52.560
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'LL STAY?

15:52.734 --> 15:55.258
BECAUSE I'M
GOING TO REPLACE
THE MOMMY HE LOST,

15:55.432 --> 15:57.869
AND THE SOURCE WILL
REPLACE HIS DADDY.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
THE SOURCE?

16:00.089 --> 16:01.656
WE CAN'T BRING HIM BACK.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.310
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE CAN'T,

16:03.484 --> 16:05.486
NOT WITHOUT WYATT,
ANYWAY.

16:19.674 --> 16:22.416
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

16:23.765 --> 16:25.636
I'M SORRY.
IS THAT Y-YOURS?

16:25.810 --> 16:26.942
IS YOUR NAME
SYLVIA, TOO?

16:27.116 --> 16:30.032
SYLVIA? THAT'S SO FUNNY.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.252
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

16:32.426 --> 16:34.645
UM...FINE. GREAT.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.126
YEAH. THANKS.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.955
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU? THAT'S OK.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.609
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
WHEN WE MET,

16:41.783 --> 16:43.045
KIND OF A CROWDED PARTY.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.481
DEX INTRODUCED US,
ACTUALLY.

16:44.655 --> 16:45.613
OH, DEX! RIGHT.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.702
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.

16:47.876 --> 16:48.572
I DON'T
REMEMBER MEETING--

16:48.746 --> 16:50.270
JO. JO BENNET.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.141
I'M A--I'M AN ART DEALER.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.622
REALLY? SO AM I.
WHAT FIRM?

16:54.796 --> 16:56.537
OH! UM...

16:56.711 --> 16:58.495
WELL, I DEAL MOSTLY
WITH PRIVATE COLLECTORS,

16:58.669 --> 17:00.889
YOU KNOW, KIND OF
HUSH-HUSH TRANSACTIONS,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.891
STUFF LIKE THAT--
HOW IS DEX?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.415
UH, DEX IS...GOOD,
I GUESS.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.243
YEAH, HE JUST, UH--
HE JUST HAD A SHOW
LAST WEEK.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.244
IT WENT REALLY WELL.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.245
HE'S GOT
SOME GOOD STUFF.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.333
GREAT. GREAT.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.465
ARE YOU TWO
STILL GOING OUT?

17:11.639 --> 17:14.120
DEX AND I? NO.
NO, NOT ANYMORE.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.426
REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.820
UH, YEAH.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.083
I THINK
I'D REMEMBER THAT.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.476
WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.086
OH, PROBABLY JUST
A LITTLE STRANGE THING.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.088
I WAS ACTUALLY HERE, UM,
YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY,

17:26.262 --> 17:28.699
AND I--I THOUGHT
I SAW YOU TWO KISSING.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.658
OH, YEAH, THAT. UM...

17:30.832 --> 17:31.702
YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS NOTHING.

17:31.876 --> 17:32.834
WE WERE JUST
SAYING HELLO.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.575
OH. OH.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.316
WE BROKE UP
MONTHS AGO.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.231
THAT'S GREAT.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.016
NO! THAT'S AWFUL.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.932
HEY, IT WAS FUN
WHILE IT LASTED.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.065
YOU KNOW,
IT STILL IS FUN ONCE
IN A WHILE, ACTUALLY.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.893
IF YOU,
YOU KNOW, INCLUDE
THE BREAKUP SEX.

17:49.894 --> 17:50.895
BREAKUP SEX?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.897
YEAH. IS THERE
ANYTHING BETTER?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.464
LISTEN, I GOTTA RUN.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.727
UH, IT WAS NICE
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

17:56.901 --> 17:57.946
YEAH, IT WAS...

17:58.120 --> 18:00.470
REAL NICE SEEING YOU.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.999
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S NOT A PUMPKIN?

18:08.174 --> 18:11.220
OH. I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW IT SLIPPED MY MIND.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.789
WE DECIDED MICE COSTUMES
WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE.

18:14.963 --> 18:19.272
OH, BUT WYATT'S
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
BEING A PUMPKIN.

18:19.446 --> 18:22.275
OH. POOR THING.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.668
MAYBE THE PROBLEM
IS THE GREEN THING
ON HIS HEAD.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.583
THE...

18:26.757 --> 18:28.455
GREEN THING
IS THE STEM,

18:28.629 --> 18:30.674
THE STEM
OF THE PUMPKIN I WAS
UP ALL NIGHT MAKING.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.590
AND IT'S A CUTE PUMPKIN...
REALLY.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.331
WELL, I THINK
HE SHOULD WEAR IT.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.160
BUT THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU NOW...IS IT?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.901
EXCUSE ME?

18:40.075 --> 18:43.426
LADIES. WE ALL WANT
THE CHILDREN TO BE
HAPPY, DON'T WE?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.862
ESPECIALLY WYATT.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.081
HE'S BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH LATELY.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.909
AND LOSING
HIS MOTHER AND ALL...

18:48.083 --> 18:50.694
WE DON'T WANT TO
TRAUMATIZE HIM ANY FURTHER.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.741
OH, NO.
HE'S NOT TRAUMATIZED.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.525
I MEAN, HE HAS...ME.

18:55.699 --> 18:59.877
AND YOU'RE DOING
THE VERY BEST JOB
YOU CAN...

19:00.051 --> 19:01.052
CONSIDERING.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.576
CONSIDERING WHAT?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.491
HOW NEW YOU ARE AT THIS,

19:04.665 --> 19:06.101
HOW OVERWORKED
YOU MUST BE.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.321
SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU DO LOOK EXHAUSTED.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.497
I'M FINE,
AND WYATT'S FINE.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.934
WE'RE ALL FINE. NOW...

19:13.108 --> 19:14.675
IF YOU'LL
JUST EXCUSE ME.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.765
SWEETIE, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THE MOUSE COSTUME,

19:17.939 --> 19:19.854
I CAN WHIP ONE UP
FOR WYATT IN A JIFFY.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.203
[FORCED LAUGH][CELL PHONE RINGS]

19:21.377 --> 19:24.467
I CAN JIFFY-WHIP ONE
UP MYSELF, ACTUALLY.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.166
REALLY, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.863
YOU'VE DONE QUITE
ENOUGH ALREADY.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.300
[RING]RIGHT.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.174
LEO...

19:35.348 --> 19:37.611
PLEASE TELL ME
THERE'S A DEMON SOMEWHERE,

19:37.785 --> 19:39.526
BECAUSE I REALLY NEED
TO BLOW SOMETHING UP.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.918
SORRY.
EVERYTHING'S FINE,

19:41.092 --> 19:42.703
EXCEPT BILLIE WANTS
TO GO TO MAGIC SCHOOL.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.008
WHAT? NO.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.532
THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD HER, TOO.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.838
OOH! THAT WOMAN
IS OUT TO GET ME.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.405
LOOK, PIPER,
I THINK SHE'S DEFIANT,

19:49.579 --> 19:51.364
BUT I THINK
HER INTENTIONS ARE GOOD.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.670
WELL, SHE MAY SEEM
NICE AND SWEET,

19:53.844 --> 19:56.195
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPLY
TWEAKED BENEATH THE SURFACE.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.587
COME ON, PIPER.
I DON'T THINK BILLIE--

19:57.761 --> 19:59.676
NO, NOT BILLIE. MANDI...

19:59.850 --> 20:02.244
THE "MISS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE"
I'VE BEEN GRIPING ABOUT.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.639
NOT ONLY IS SHE GETTING
MORE CLOYINGLY PERFECT
WITH EVERY MOMENT,

20:05.813 --> 20:07.597
BUT NOW SHE IS ACTUALLY
OUT TO GET ME.

20:07.771 --> 20:08.990
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.601
UGH! I WISH I COULD
JUST BLOW HER UP.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.081
PIPER, YOU CAN'T
BLOW HER UP.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.213
SHE'S NOT A DEMON.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.605
NO, SHE'S WORSE
THAN A DEMON.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.085
SHE'S A ROOM MOM!

20:17.259 --> 20:18.782
IT'S TIME TO COME HOME
NOW, HONEY, OK?

20:18.956 --> 20:21.524
[SIGHS]

20:23.787 --> 20:25.789
HEY! ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

20:25.963 --> 20:27.313
WE'RE GOING TO
MAGIC SCHOOL OR WHAT?

20:27.487 --> 20:29.445
UH, WELL, SHE SAID
WHAT I THOUGHT SHE'D SAY--NO.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.925
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.274
COME ON. DO YOU ALWAYS
LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS?

20:32.448 --> 20:33.754
YOU GUYS USED TO
LIVE AND BREATHE DANGER.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.190
RIGHT, AND NOW
WE'RE RETIRED.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.670
EXACTLY. YOU'RE OFF
BEING OZZIE AND HARRIET.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.020
IT'S MY JOB TO PICK UP
THE SLACK AROUND HERE.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.151
I NEED TO LEARN QUICK.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.892
AND MAGIC SCHOOL
HAS BOOKS,

20:42.066 --> 20:43.459

AND REALLY
BITCHIN' WEAPONS.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.896
WHICH YOU CAN READ ABOUT
IN THE TEXTBOOKS.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.638
I'M DONE READING 'EM.

20:48.812 --> 20:49.900
I'M GONG
TO MAGIC SCHOOL.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.467
HOW?
I'M A QUICK STUDY.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.077
OK, WAIT. WE'LL GET...

20:54.078 --> 20:55.428
EXPOSED.

20:55.602 --> 20:56.516

20:56.690 --> 20:58.822
I DID?
HOW COOL.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.302
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.436
WHO ARE THEY?
ARE THEY STUDENTS?

21:03.610 --> 21:04.959
NO, THEY'RE DEMONS.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.178
DEMONS? WHAT ARE
DEMONS DOING HERE?

21:09.137 --> 21:12.009
TAKING OVER.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.188

21:17.363 --> 21:18.320
OK. THIS IS BAD.

21:18.494 --> 21:19.626

REALLY BAD.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.149
HE'S KINDA CUTE, THOUGH.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.194
NO, THEY'RE NOT CUTE,
OK? THEY'RE DEMONS.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.718
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS, HUH?

21:24.892 --> 21:25.936
HURT, MAIM, KILL.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.460
A LOTTA MONOSYLLABLES.
GOT IT.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.244
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
IF THEY'VE TAKEN OVER,

21:29.418 --> 21:30.724
IT MEANS THEY HAVE
ACCESS TO EVERYTHING,

21:30.898 --> 21:32.508
SPELLS, MAPS, WEAPONS.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.641
YOU KNOW, THESE MIGHT
COME IN HANDY.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.512
LOOK, WITH
EVERYTHING HERE,

21:36.686 --> 21:38.558
THEY CAN WIPE US ALL

ELDERS, GNOMES.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.211
WITCHES?

21:41.387 --> 21:42.518
OK, FINE.

POTION, RIGHT?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.091

21:50.265 --> 21:51.527
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.181
DO I LOOK LIKE
I THINK AHEAD?

21:53.355 --> 21:54.748
COME ON. YOU USED
TO RUN THE PLACE.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.140
HOW DID YOU GET

IF WE CAN FIND IT.

22:02.582 --> 22:03.844
OK. I'M LISTENING.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.281
OK. HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO--

22:06.455 --> 22:08.414
OK. DON'T MOVE.
DON'T SAY A WORD.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.546
HYAH!

22:10.720 --> 22:12.287

AN HAND?

22:14.855 --> 22:15.856
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:16.030 --> 22:17.510
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM,
JOIN 'EM.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.387
LEO.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.957

22:40.184 --> 22:43.753
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT

22:43.927 --> 22:46.495
YUCKY SANDWICH

BUT I'M HERE.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.836

YOU DO YOUR MAGIC.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.447
I DO.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.014
IN FACT,

23:27.188 --> 23:33.977
WHY DON'T WE JUST

23:34.151 --> 23:35.544

TRASH CAN?

23:35.718 --> 23:37.154
CAN YOU DO THAT?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.548
NO ONE'S WATCHING.

23:39.722 --> 23:40.941
[GASPS]

23:43.291 --> 23:44.814
LOOK AT THAT.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.816
GOOD BOY!

23:46.990 --> 23:49.340
GOOD BOY!

23:49.515 --> 23:51.517
GOOD JOB!

23:52.996 --> 23:55.521
LET'S DO THAT AGAIN.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.660
OK. OK.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.401
FOR PHOEBE.

24:12.102 --> 24:15.758
I CREATED THIS ONE AS
A COMPANION TO THE ONE
I ALREADY SOLD YOU.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.281
HI, SYLVIA.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.674
HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING.

24:18.848 --> 24:19.893
ACTUALLY, IF YOU
COULD JUST GIVE US--

24:20.067 --> 24:21.677
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE CAN COME BACK.

24:21.851 --> 24:22.852
ARE YOU SURE?
I'M SURE.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.114
WE NEED TO THINK
ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.682
WE'LL CALL YOU.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.641
WELL,
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.165
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.254
I HOPE I DIDN'T
SCREW UP A SALE.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.299
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, SYLVIA?

24:35.474 --> 24:36.475
WHAT, I'M FINE
IN THE SACK,

24:36.649 --> 24:38.041
BUT I DON'T RATE
A WORK VISIT, HUH?

24:38.215 --> 24:39.913
WHAT?
PLEASE.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.741
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.394
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.440
HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.137
OK, LOOK,

24:47.311 --> 24:48.225
HERE'S THE DEAL, BUSTER.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.010
IT'S OVER, ALL RIGHT?

24:50.184 --> 24:51.315
FINITO. NO MAS.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.839
YESTERDAY'S NEWS,

24:53.013 --> 24:54.101
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.103
DO I HAVE TO SPELL THIS
OUT FOR YOU?

24:56.277 --> 24:59.541
I AM DONE WITH
THE BREAKUP SEX.

24:59.715 --> 25:00.890
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME
OR ANYBODY ELSE

25:01.064 --> 25:03.937
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
SEEING AT THE MOMENT,

25:04.111 --> 25:05.068
UNDERSTAND?

25:05.242 --> 25:07.027
YEAH, BUT--

25:07.201 --> 25:10.073
UH-UH. FORGET IT.
NO MORE FREEBIES.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.249
IT'S TIME TO MAKE
AN HONEST MAN OUT OF YOURSELF,

25:12.423 --> 25:14.077
BE TRUE TO THE ONE
YOU LOVE.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.470
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:15.644 --> 25:17.733
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.344
WE HAVEN'T
SLEPT TOGETHER
IN OVER 2 MONTHS.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.957
WE HAVEN'T?
NO.

25:27.003 --> 25:30.354
DO I...LIE A LOT?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.618
THAT'S WHY WE BROKE UP.

25:33.619 --> 25:34.968
DEX. HEY.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.317
PHOEBE!

25:37.579 --> 25:38.580
EXCUSE ME?

25:38.754 --> 25:39.842
FREEBIES.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.844
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT FREEBIES.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.153
JULIE, UH, SYLVIA.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.676
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

NICE MEETING YOU.
TAKE CARE. BYE-BYE.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.818
UH...EX-GIRLFRIEND.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.515
UH-HUH.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.567
WHEW, WHEW, WHEW.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.790
WOULD YOU JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE?
IT LOOKS HOT.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.705
REALLY?
THANKS, I THINK.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.885
HEY! WATCH IT,
BUDDY!

26:25.192 --> 26:26.410
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET US KILLED?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.195
WHAT? WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE EVIL, NOT WIMPS.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.500
OK, LET'S JUST
FIND THE SPELL, OK?

26:29.675 --> 26:30.980
FINE.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.420
Demon: RIGHT THERE
ALREADY.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.598
OW.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.296
EVERYTHING'S
OUT OF ORDER.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.211
WHAT IS?

26:44.385 --> 26:46.213
THE BOOKS.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.041
NOTHING'S WHERE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.956
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE DOING?

26:51.697 --> 26:53.481
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO HANG AROU--

26:55.396 --> 26:56.484
Billie: WYATT.

26:56.658 --> 27:00.227
WELCOME HOME,
SWEETIE PIE.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.279
Mandi: YOU WANNA

27:09.453 --> 27:10.280
Wyatt: YEAH.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.456
COME OVER HERE.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.762
HOW DID SHE EVEN
GET WYATT?

27:13.936 --> 27:15.459
HEY.
SEE THAT?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.897
I SHOULD'VE LET
PIPER BLOW HER UP.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.028
WHAT, YOU KNOW HER?

27:19.202 --> 27:21.465
YEAH,
SHE'S WYATT'S ROOM MOM,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.032
OR SO SHE SAID
SHE WAS.

27:23.206 --> 27:24.381
Mandi: WANNA FLY
THE HELICOPTER?

27:24.555 --> 27:26.035
WHAT DOES SHE
WANT WITH HIM?

27:27.428 --> 27:29.778
WAIT. WHAT--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:29.952 --> 27:30.997
I'M GOING
TO SAVE MY SON.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.651
ARE YOU INSANE?
LOOK AROUND.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.565
YOU'RE GONNA GET US KILLED.
YOU'RE GONNA GETMEKILLED.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.393
[SIGHS] YEAH,
WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.308
WE GOTTA GET HELP.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.267
FEELS GOOD TO BE
BACK AT MAGIC SCHOOL,
DOESN'T IT?

27:40.441 --> 27:44.445
IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.626
IS EVERYTHING READY?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.193
YES.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.587
ALTHOUGH, ARE YOU SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

27:56.762 --> 27:59.590
THE BOY TRUSTS ME.
OTHERWISE HE WOULD
HAVE ORBED ME INTO--

27:59.765 --> 28:02.115
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE BOY.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.943
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE SOURCE.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.249
FOUND IT.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.164
WHO'S THE SOURCE?

28:08.338 --> 28:09.557
THE SOURCE?

28:11.646 --> 28:14.127
I'M JUST SAYING, HE
COULD BE PRETTY PISSED.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.694
AFTER ALL,
HE NEVER THOUGHT

28:15.868 --> 28:17.260
THE CHARMED ONES
COULD VANQUISH HIM.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.523
I'LL HANDLE HIM.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.790
HOW?

28:24.964 --> 28:27.880
I'M BRINGING HIM BACK
FROM THE DEAD, AREN'T I?

28:28.054 --> 28:29.229
HE'LL OWE ME.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.535
PLUS HE'LL HAVE A SON
OF THE CHARMED ONE

28:31.710 --> 28:34.277
TO RAISE AS HIS VERY OWN.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.323
WHAT BETTER REVENGE
IS THERE THAN THAT?

28:36.497 --> 28:37.367
OK, THE SPELL'S
ON PAGE 86.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.847
YOU GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

28:39.021 --> 28:39.979
WAIT. WAIT. YOU WANT ME
TO GO BY MYSELF? WHY?

28:40.153 --> 28:41.110
I'M NOT LEAVING MY SON.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.198
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY POWERS.

28:42.372 --> 28:43.460
I HAVE POWERS.
I SHOULD STAY.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.766
LISTEN TO ME.
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE

28:44.940 --> 28:46.333
THAN THE SOURCE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

28:46.507 --> 28:48.030
I CAN'T LEAVE
MY SON ALONE.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.904
OK. JUST BE CAREFUL.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.866
ARE YOU SURE
ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER

28:58.040 --> 28:59.868
DIDN'T PICK HIM UP?

29:00.042 --> 29:02.044
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T
BE FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.394
OHH! OK, OK,
HERE, SEE?

29:04.568 --> 29:05.352
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.006
WYATT IS WITH MANDI.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.182
MANDI?
