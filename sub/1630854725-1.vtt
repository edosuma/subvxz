WEBVTT

02:49.604 --> 02:51.649
I thought the coppers
almost at me that time.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.316
Oh!

03:06.490 --> 03:10.364
Do say cheers
to St. Peter for me, Mary Kelly.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.676
- Here.
- Jack!

03:19.938 --> 03:20.938
Hello.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.376
Anyone here?

03:24.378 --> 03:27.337
Jack!

03:27.511 --> 03:28.512
Richard?

03:32.647 --> 03:34.562
Blimey! Is that you?

03:36.520 --> 03:39.044
Oh, it's okay, mate.
I lost the coppers.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.733
What are you doing? I said I lost them.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.531
Hey, you.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.880
Caught.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.621
Caught like a rat in a trap.

03:52.884 --> 03:53.885
What are you doing?

03:54.669 --> 03:55.669
Stop!

04:11.207 --> 04:12.339
Oh.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.168
Did you see
what that woman was wearing?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.388
Is that how the
puritans really dressed?

04:18.867 --> 04:20.608
Uh... I don't think

04:20.782 --> 04:23.611
the puritans wear
their dresses that low cut,

04:23.785 --> 04:26.701
- at least not without a scarlet aye.
- Yeah.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.529
And I love this old house.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.748
It just screams "scream."

04:31.532 --> 04:32.794
Just like the doorbell.

04:33.751 --> 04:34.839
Um, anyway,

04:35.666 --> 04:39.888
this is the master library
in all its, uh, booky splendor.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.854
Is this where you want me
to set up?

04:42.717 --> 04:43.761
In the library?

04:44.109 --> 04:45.435
Well, it's where we found him.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.548
And he liked to be called Jack.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.941
Is that because he claimed
to be Jack the Ripper?

04:50.115 --> 04:54.685
- Oh, he was Jack the Ripper. He channeled the original.
- Yep.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.818
How could you tell?

04:56.992 --> 04:59.037
- He started carrying around a knife...
- Jesus!

04:59.211 --> 05:02.127
And memorizing 900 numbers.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.956
- You brought the real one.
- Yeah.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.916
He was re-enacting
the five canonical murders.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.137
If he had time,
the Putnam murders.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.705
But they never found
any evidence.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.533
Remember that.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.492
Only because
he was extremely clever.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.668
Well, he was also very psychic.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.801
You know, it helps to know
what the police are gonna do next.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.367
This is true.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.938
But bad people
don't get to stick around.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.070
They go somewhere.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.943
I never did understand all this.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.117
What? Yeah...

05:37.380 --> 05:38.947
Uh, good people after death,

05:39.121 --> 05:41.645
sometimes hang around
their loved ones or a place,

05:41.819 --> 05:45.823
especially if they have unfinished
business or regrets about passing.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.697
And what happens
with the bad spirits?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.394
Oh, well...

05:52.874 --> 05:54.223
Oh, jeez!

05:55.006 --> 05:56.006
And...

05:56.878 --> 05:58.706
what's the determining
factor? I mean...

05:59.924 --> 06:01.012
it's not, uh,

06:01.839 --> 06:03.275
fudging on your taxes?

06:04.407 --> 06:07.323
I never could prove up
my dependence.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.238
Man, you're single.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.935
That's why
I could never prove 'em up.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.698
The dividing line is souls
that would torment the living.

06:13.851 --> 06:14.983
That fits Jack.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.029
Well, allegedly.

06:18.203 --> 06:22.033
But hey, if he's found a way
to stick around,

06:22.512 --> 06:26.211
then maybe he was innocent.
Habeas no corpus.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.954
All right, I guess we do need
to find out what happened to him.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.653
If my uncle
is channeling Jack the Ripper,

06:32.827 --> 06:35.090
their spirits gonna become
twisted together,

06:35.612 --> 06:38.398
mix into one soul
so they can't be separated.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.748
Oh. That's awful.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.403
Channeling can be risky
if the spirit's malignant.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.796
Maybe we should rethink this.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.929
Um, the important thing

06:48.103 --> 06:49.409
is to figure out what happened.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.324
But why did we have
to sneak in the backway?

06:55.371 --> 06:57.721
Uh, we're under
strict instructions

06:57.895 --> 07:00.942
not to let anyone disturb
the Halloween party.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.031
But I want to see the ballroom.

07:03.205 --> 07:06.164
Yeah,
that would be against the rules.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.603
You have to be an Auldcraft

07:09.777 --> 07:13.607
in order to attend an Auldcraft
Hallowed Eve's ball.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.740
- Why can't I go as Seymour's date? He's an Auldcraft.
- Um...

07:16.914 --> 07:19.482
- I took my name off the attendee list years ago.
- Yeah.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.137
Not even girlfriends
or significant others.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.921
You don't have any caterers?

07:24.531 --> 07:27.142
Well, they come in early
and set up.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.709
People to clean up?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.015
They'll come in tomorrow.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.802
And all the curtains are drawn,
before you ask.

07:34.976 --> 07:38.240
And we would check IDs
at the gate

07:38.893 --> 07:40.460
if we didn't know
everyone already.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.549
- Um.
- You really think of everything.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.377
I am the estate manager.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.944
Can't I just take a peek?

07:47.379 --> 07:49.294
Uh, n... I'm sorry.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.297
It is a private party
for family only.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.778
And I am not family. I get it.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.608
Hey, that doesn't mean
you can't have

07:58.782 --> 08:01.829
a world-famous
Auldcraft Hallowtini.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.657
What's a Hallowtini?

08:03.831 --> 08:07.182
Well, it may be eye of newt,

08:07.356 --> 08:11.403
unicorn horn powder,
and boiled frog.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.057
Delicious.

08:13.231 --> 08:16.191
Or it may be vodka,

08:16.365 --> 08:18.454
powdered sugar,
and green food coloring.

08:18.628 --> 08:19.628
You decide.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.631
- One for you?
- Nah, thank you.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.328
I don't drink
while conducting séances.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.939
Oh, I get it.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.113
Don't drink and drive.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.641
Lily, it's just a stupid party
everybody goes to.

08:32.294 --> 08:36.167
- A party that we have to be married to attend.
- Yeah, but...

08:36.820 --> 08:38.779
And you don't believe in marriage.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.172
- I believe that's come up over brunch.
- But...

08:41.738 --> 08:44.045
Yeah, but,
but we've talked about this.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.259
I mean, we're still young.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.091
Let's talk about it again.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.398
But what's wrong
with keeping our relationship

08:49.572 --> 08:51.095
the way it is? We're just fine.

08:51.748 --> 08:55.447
So I can continue to endure
the frantic calls from my mother

08:55.622 --> 08:59.016
- and the smirks from my blissfully married sister.
- Lily?

09:00.801 --> 09:04.065
My point is,
I'll survive missing a party.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.895
Even a famously spooky one.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.509
At least there won't be any
ghost attending, right?

09:10.724 --> 09:13.814
I mean, it's like that time
we actually saw Bigfoot.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.425
That was moss on a tree.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.296
It was very scary moss.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.212
We shouldn't finish setting up.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.825
So what are we using tonight?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.349
Uh, tonight is all me.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.090
But the show?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.180
You don't need
any gimmicks.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.660
Well, people are so disappointed

09:33.834 --> 09:35.836
without the cheesy
special effects.

09:36.532 --> 09:40.188
- What's the first rule?
- The second rule is to get them to text all their friends.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.886
Um, yeah,
but what's the first rule?

09:44.192 --> 09:47.674
- Never use more special effects than people need to believe.
- Exactly.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.806
And these people
believe already.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.722
- Well, that's not surprising, considering where we are.
- True.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.204
But I bought new gear.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.988
Mm, you wasted your money.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.773
Come on, Mr. Auldcraft.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.387
Don't you want to show them
how we...

10:02.079 --> 10:04.081
play with fire?

10:05.909 --> 10:07.737
- How did you do that?
- You like?

10:08.172 --> 10:11.349
- Yeah, I like.
- It's a shame we aren't using any tricks.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.272
All right, fine.
We'll use that one.

10:13.351 --> 10:14.526
- I like that one.
- Yay.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.268
But don't use that tonight.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.793
Oh, come on,
just let me do a quick reading.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.185
Aren't you curious?

10:21.795 --> 10:24.014
I bet this place
registers a two.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.150
Oh, see? I told you, a two.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.763
No! A two and a half. Wow!

10:34.372 --> 10:37.854
The famously haunted Auldcraft
Mansion lives up to its reputation.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.205
We should really finish
setting up.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.035
Remember that time that
we visited Dunridge Sanatorium,

10:45.209 --> 10:46.689
and I got a reading of four?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.478
Well, the spectrograph
is reading eight.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.830
A... A ten.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.746
What?

11:04.011 --> 11:05.012
What is this place?

11:07.144 --> 11:09.581
It's weird. That's weird.
That shouldn't happen.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.281
Oh, but... I got a reading of 12.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.893
I mean, I wouldn't expect that
high of a reading in purgatory.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.491
It's probably just
a surge in the battery.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.289
Those old models, it happens.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.169
I'm back.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.041
And I got 'em

11:34.215 --> 11:37.958
to give you
extra unicorn horn powder,

11:38.523 --> 11:42.179
mummy dust, and a gummy maggot.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.355
- Uh...
- Whoa!

11:46.836 --> 11:48.795
You looked like you need it.
What happened?

11:49.230 --> 11:51.972
I... Uh, it's, it's nothing.
Equipment problems.

11:52.146 --> 11:52.973
Thanks for the drink.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.411
Can you, um,
turn down that drink?

11:56.585 --> 11:58.979
I have to concentrate.

11:59.153 --> 12:02.069
Hey, look, don't be grumpy
just because you can't drink.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.363
This is your element, right?

12:04.158 --> 12:05.420
I mean, yeah,

12:05.594 --> 12:07.291
but we still don't know
the details.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.467
How did Jack die?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.557
Um... All right, we...

12:14.646 --> 12:17.301
found his body right here...

12:18.563 --> 12:20.827
with his knife in his chest.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.786
Someone murdered him
in this room?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.527
Well, couldn't have.

12:25.701 --> 12:28.356
There was no one in the house
that whole weekend.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.619
Oh, then he fell
on his own knife?

12:33.883 --> 12:35.102
Weird, huh?

12:35.755 --> 12:36.755
Uh...

12:37.452 --> 12:39.889
That's why we need a seer

12:40.063 --> 12:41.935
to help us figure out
the details.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.980
And who better than my nephew?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.376
Wow.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.639
Party's turning up.

12:51.683 --> 12:55.818
It sounds like the "Monster
Mash" being played on a Victrola.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.777
They will dance to it
until dawn.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.867
- Wow!
- And yeah, your, uh...

13:02.042 --> 13:06.437
Julia asked about
whether you'd be coming tonight.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.788
Oh! What did you tell her?

13:10.093 --> 13:11.791
Told her you'd be busy as usual.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.662
Uh, who's Julia?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.533
Mm, nobody in particular.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.013
Gerald?

13:19.189 --> 13:20.408
Um...

13:21.191 --> 13:23.803
- She's...
- Yes. Who?

13:25.587 --> 13:26.980
Uh, you know...

13:28.416 --> 13:32.724
Seymour, it was a really fantastic
idea to bring Lily here tonight.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.292
I mean, there's absolutely
no possibility

13:35.466 --> 13:37.642
- of a complete disaster.
- All right, f...

13:38.426 --> 13:40.506
Let's proceed with the séance
as quickly as possible.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.865
What... We're not all here.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.737
S... Someone else is joining us?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.739
Well, commandeering
is more like it.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.612
You, you promised me.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.485
Yes, I promised you.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.010
Okay.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.101
Just remember
whatever happens after this...

14:02.537 --> 14:03.625
wasn't my idea.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.409
Oh, come on.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.588
Oh, but... Oh, okay.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.200
I wasn't finished.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.681
They're here.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.777
I have materialized.

14:25.952 --> 14:30.217
Oh. This female is a mistake,
Seymour Edwin Auldcraft.

14:30.391 --> 14:33.751
All right, buddy, I don't want you in my
personal life. Or I'm walking out that door.

14:33.916 --> 14:38.312
You would do well to show more
respect for the head of your family.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.010
Or what? If this was a donks,
I think I'd miss.

14:41.184 --> 14:44.057
Oh, you conceited,
young popinjay.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.148
Now, Richard, compose yourself.

14:48.322 --> 14:52.630
No one who is not in the family
should be in the manor tonight.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.068
She is my family.

14:55.242 --> 14:58.027
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You haven't married her.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.030
- Oh...
- So it would be wonderful if you did.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.947
What if she discovered
our secret, hmm?

15:05.513 --> 15:08.081
She could break over 200 years
of tradition.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.866
Look, she's been told
not to leave this room, okay?

15:11.345 --> 15:13.477
Hey, I promise
not to see anything tonight.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Delightful.

15:15.479 --> 15:19.135
The unenforceable promise
of a femme seule.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.659
- A what?
- A woman alone.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.096
You sound like my mother.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.054
Let's all calm down.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.709
Uh, perhaps if I prepare
some tea.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.410
Oh, lemon curd
and clotted cream.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.803
I am in heaven.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.196
Not yet, dear.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.285
Why are you two even here?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.809
I don't need any help
conducting this séance.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.419
Of course you do.

15:42.593 --> 15:46.467
Every conductor
needs his symphonic orchestra.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.956
- But...
- Don't worry, Mr. Auldcraft.

15:48.991 --> 15:49.992
Seymour will do great.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.170
Because he's got spirit.
Yes, he does.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.172
He's got spirit and my love.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.395
I see why a wedding
is out of the question.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.309
- Shut up.
- Uh.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.357
Now, Richard,
let me see if I understand.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.967
Seymour, dear...

16:09.925 --> 16:12.667
you can't perform your séance
without your little friend?

16:13.059 --> 16:14.059
That's right.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.236
And we need a séance.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.890
One with Seymour's
particular set of skills?

16:19.065 --> 16:20.066
Regrettably so.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.634
Then we must proceed. Correct?

16:23.808 --> 16:26.333
We might as well
be pleasant to each other.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.291
Hey, I am being pleasant.

16:28.465 --> 16:33.601
I do not like being forced
to be pleasant under duress.

16:34.558 --> 16:35.298
Boys...

16:38.910 --> 16:39.910
Fine.

16:40.738 --> 16:41.738
Acceptable.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.177
Wonderful. Wonderful.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.788
Now, I believe
it would be proper

16:46.962 --> 16:50.183
for me to introduce myself
to our guest.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.100
Good evening,
I'm Victoria Fidelia Auldcraft.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.840
Lily Herdston.
Pleased to meet you.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.408
Pleasure to meet you, dear.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.149
My visiting card.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.892
Oh! I'll Facebook you.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.414
Yes?

17:06.373 --> 17:08.288
Well, dear,
if you like to face books,

17:08.462 --> 17:10.768
the library
is a perfect place to be.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.466
No, Mrs. Auldcraft. I meant...

17:12.640 --> 17:14.642
Oh, no, please call me
by my Christian name.

17:14.816 --> 17:18.167
Victoria. I was named after
the British Queen, of course.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.040
I could have sworn
the Queen was named after you.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.522
I trust the family history
has been explained to you.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.133
Uh, no, not really.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.526
Um...

17:30.614 --> 17:33.661
They like to dress up
in fancy past duds.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.142
It reminds them
of the good old days.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.275
That's a bit simplistic,
but, but true.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.844
And did you explain
our illustrious family history?

17:43.018 --> 17:44.715
Why we enjoy our duds?

17:46.717 --> 17:49.590
Right. Yeah. So, um,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.593
this place is old, right?

17:53.724 --> 17:56.510
So a whole bunch of people

17:56.684 --> 17:59.774
have died here over the years,
a whole lot.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.690
No, that won't do
in the slightest.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.997
Many wonderful people
have lived,

18:06.868 --> 18:08.870
and yes, died here.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.656
Generals, governors,
captains of industry.

18:12.830 --> 18:16.704
The history of the Auldcraft
family is the history of great men,

18:16.878 --> 18:21.143
- like our founder.
- A distinctly dashing fellow

18:21.317 --> 18:24.842
who laid the cornerstone
to this house in 1786.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.583
He laid it crooked.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.151
- He laid it perfectly.
- No, he didn't.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.241
Balls were held here,
the Civil War planned,

18:32.415 --> 18:37.116
fortunes were made, and,
and squandered and amplified.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.640
Throughout the eras,
the Auldcraft family

18:39.814 --> 18:42.599
has maintained the highest
standards of civilized living.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.254
Not to mention civilized deaths.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.913
Today, the Auldcraft family continues
its march proudly to the present.

18:52.087 --> 18:56.091
And now we proudly proceed
to our present business

18:56.657 --> 18:58.267
- contacting Jack.
- Oh!

18:58.441 --> 19:03.229
I refused to refer
to Jonathan Theodore as Jack.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.883
Call him what you like,
but we must call him.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.276
Oh, I understand.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.235
How do we proceed,
Seymour, dear?

19:09.974 --> 19:12.455
Well, everybody gather
around the table.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.381
Did you see that?

19:27.035 --> 19:28.428
Did you see that?

19:28.602 --> 19:29.907
Can we get on with it?

19:30.821 --> 19:32.910
Ah! Yes.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.826
Wow, no wonder this place rates
at 12 on the spectrograph.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
All right.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.528
Everyone, take a deep breath
and focus your thoughts.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.449
So romantic.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.801
- Oh, self-igniting candles.
- Oh, check that out.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.803
How quaint.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.302
I can't believe it actually
worked. - All right...

19:57.326 --> 19:59.720
Do you have this, uh, patented?

19:59.894 --> 20:02.375
No more talking, guys.
We gotta... I gotta concentrate.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.336
Close your eyes.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.991
Focus on summing Jack.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.645
Envision him.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.125
Form his image in your mind.

20:14.691 --> 20:15.691
Lily?

20:17.085 --> 20:18.565
Spirits of the night,

20:19.174 --> 20:22.699
spirits that avoid the light,
speak to us.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.963
Uh, nothing's happening.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.705
Contacting the spirit world
isn't like using a cell phone.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.879
Okay? It takes time.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.795
There's not an app for this?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.668
No more commentary, okay?
I have to concentrate.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.583
I'm sorting the dead here, okay?

20:41.457 --> 20:44.504
Spirits, Seymour Auldcraft
is calling to you.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.463
Open the door
and pass on through.

20:47.637 --> 20:50.466
Perhaps another nursery rhyme
to try.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.468
Richard, be polite.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.166
Spirits,

20:55.341 --> 20:57.691
Seymour Auldcraft
is calling to you.

20:58.126 --> 21:01.172
- Open the door and pass on through.
- Focus.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.436
I smell perfume.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.743
Hmm.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.745
Oh!

21:08.919 --> 21:09.919
Hello, everybody.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.227
That's not Jack.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.403
Gerald...

21:16.275 --> 21:17.493
don't you recognize me?

21:18.146 --> 21:21.802
Um, Seymour Afterdark?

21:22.368 --> 21:25.284
Young lady,
leave that body immediately.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.338
- You're tying up the line.
- No, wait.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.157
Beatrice?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.466
- Is that you?
- Gerald, yes.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.904
Oh! I have been waiting ages
to see you again, dear.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.995
- Who is Beatrice?
- Gerald's fiancé. Deceased.

21:41.169 --> 21:44.433
They met in amateur theatricals
playing Romeo and Juliet.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.305
She crashed her car
into the cemetery

21:46.479 --> 21:48.176
- on the night they were engaged.
- Mm.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.178
Too many Hallowtinis.

21:50.352 --> 21:54.225
Um, Beatrice, why haven't you
passed on through to the light?

21:54.791 --> 21:56.097
Because I had to warn you.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.318
Warn me about what? Jack?

22:00.144 --> 22:01.144
Yes.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.148
Something is anchoring him
to this house.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.194
Something evil.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.066
You must destroy it, Gerald.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.242
Enough of this.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.028
- Uh, be gone, you interloper.
- No.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.682
Not yet.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.945
Stay a little longer.
What am I supposed to do?

22:18.380 --> 22:19.860
I can't hurt Seymour.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.036
I have to go.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
Goodbye, Gerald.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.043
Beatrice?

22:31.654 --> 22:33.656
Seymour, wha... what's going on?

22:34.918 --> 22:38.139
My spirit cannot leave this body
without a physical shock.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.577
What sort of physical shock?

22:41.751 --> 22:43.405
Well, I don't know exactly.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.105
But the greater the shock, the more
likelihood my spirit will be expelled.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.892
Well, I... I can't hurt Seymour.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
Mm, you're going
to have to kill him.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.072
- Or...
- Or?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.334
You could kiss me.

23:01.554 --> 23:02.554
Kiss you?

23:03.382 --> 23:04.382
In that body?

23:04.774 --> 23:05.774
No way.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.737
You loved me once.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.826
Oh, I, I still do.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.393
I just can't.

23:16.830 --> 23:17.830
Okay.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.095
Then take my hand.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.228
Oh. Sure. Okay.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.405
Anything for you, Beatrice.

23:29.277 --> 23:33.803
"For each pilgrim's hand
holds a saint's hand."

23:34.935 --> 23:39.896
"And palm to palm
is holy palmers kiss."

23:45.815 --> 23:47.895
Gerald,
what... what are you doing?

23:47.948 --> 23:49.558
Patty Cake?

23:49.732 --> 23:50.732
Seymour,

23:51.386 --> 23:52.996
your parlor tricks
are not working.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.390
You failed to channel Jack.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.305
Look, I'm sorry.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.742
Something's interfering
with the connection.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.180
I, uh... Whatever happened,
he's really stuck down there.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.748
We need answers, not old lovers.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.533
- Who?
- Um,

24:07.707 --> 24:09.012
my old fiancé.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.407
She smelled
just like Chanel No. 5.

24:13.234 --> 24:16.629
She told us a physical shock
was necessary to release her spirit.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.674
That's true.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.983
And the longer a spirit
stays inside a physical body...

24:24.158 --> 24:25.958
the more force it takes
to get it to leave.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.510
So, channeling is dangerous.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.732
- We can't leave Jonathan Theodore...
- Uh, Jack.

24:32.906 --> 24:35.996
Trapped forever between
the physical and spiritual realms.

24:37.127 --> 24:38.999
I got the sense
of an enormous evil.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.697
Uh, alleged enormous evil.

24:42.437 --> 24:46.006
Look, I can go deeper, but that
might give Jack control over me.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.399
I...
will control him.

24:49.096 --> 24:52.273
My superior ability to focus
my psychic kinetic energy

24:52.447 --> 24:55.537
will have a cooling effect
on your agitated fluids.

24:55.711 --> 24:56.930
- Mm.
- Superior.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.671
Yeah. I feel so much better

24:58.845 --> 25:00.716
That... Then we will proceed.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.458
I will. Just give me
a moment to gather my strength.

25:06.417 --> 25:10.291
Ah, the tea is ready,
and we could use a rest.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.685
Lily, would you like
to help, please?

25:12.859 --> 25:13.990
Uh, sure.

25:14.730 --> 25:15.731
Lovely.

25:16.602 --> 25:20.431
You know, I have always said
that no matter what the problem,

25:20.997 --> 25:24.000
- tea always improves one's perspective.
- Mm.

25:24.174 --> 25:27.308
Seymour,
you need more discipline.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.050
Discipline strengthens the will.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.834
I like discipline.

25:32.487 --> 25:36.360
If as long as she doesn't have
a problem with it.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.886
- When you channel Jack, will you have him firmly?
- Yes.

25:40.060 --> 25:44.891
And will he be able to control
your body like the previous one?

25:45.065 --> 25:48.111
Yeah, he will be...
...if...

25:48.285 --> 25:50.916
He might even have some slight
physical power if he's strong enough.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.115
Like what?

25:52.289 --> 25:54.770
Blowing
some air, candle.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.338
Well, I can handle the weather.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.906
Uh, let me know
when you are ready to proceed.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.691
I just need a couple more
moments to gather my strength again.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.781
Would you mind pouring, dear?

26:05.955 --> 26:10.177
My hands have been
particularly stiff today.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.744
Oh, I'd be happy to.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.446
- Tea is served.
- Oh, cucumber

26:18.620 --> 26:20.622
and watercress sandwiches.
It's my favorite.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.104
Huh. How are you feeling, dear?

26:24.757 --> 26:25.758
You look pale.

26:26.933 --> 26:30.937
Uh, well, I've watched Seymour
conduct séances for years.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.460
It's a wonderful skill.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.637
We go around and we do
a lot of good for people.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.552
- But...
- Yes?

26:38.118 --> 26:41.904
Channeling Jack feels wrong.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.907
We're in the Auldcraft Manor.
Nothing wrong ever happens here.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.520
Could you take this
to Seymour, dear?

26:52.175 --> 26:54.961
It just,
it doesn't make any sense.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.053
I just don't understand
why this is so hard.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.098
Is his name written down?

27:02.272 --> 27:03.491
Yes.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.493
His name is duly inscribed.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.843
Unlike yours.

27:08.496 --> 27:11.281
Yeah, thanks
for rubbing that in.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.283
Something is tying Jack
to this world

27:13.457 --> 27:15.329
and interfering
with the connection.

27:16.373 --> 27:19.725
Um, Beatrice said something
that you should know.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.509
- What?
- Uh, Gerald.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.295
Uh, there's no need
to trouble Seymour with trivia.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.907
- But...
- I said it's irrelevant.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.822
May I talk to you?

27:30.823 --> 27:32.172
- Privately?
- Sure.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.568
Seymour, you're going
to go deeper?

27:38.134 --> 27:40.006
Yeah, I have to.
There's interference.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.791
But the deeper you go, the
more the spirit is in control.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.228
Well, look, I can handle it.

27:45.794 --> 27:49.058
What is it with this place? Why is
there so much spiritual energy here?

27:50.277 --> 27:52.714
- Can't say.
- You mean you won't say.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.412
This isn't some child's game
of hokey-pokey.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.719
This is stepping in,
and stepping out,

27:57.893 --> 28:00.069
and shaking
this fair world all about.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.289
Lily, I'll be fine, all right?

28:02.942 --> 28:04.702
I wasn't this weirded out
when we met the ghost

28:04.726 --> 28:07.511
of Christmas Past,
Present, and Future.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.513
Look, those were carolers,
all right?

28:09.688 --> 28:11.341
They were very scary carolers.

28:11.515 --> 28:12.515
Lily.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.344
What?

28:15.781 --> 28:18.305
- Slap me.
- What? Come again.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.960
If Jack does take control,

28:21.743 --> 28:23.658
a slap will shock him
into releasing me.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.007
Are you sure?

28:25.834 --> 28:26.835
I'm positive.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.490
- Well, there's something else.
- What?

28:33.276 --> 28:34.625
Oh, no.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.236
Good evening.

28:36.845 --> 28:40.370
- Why, good evening, Julia.
- Julia?

28:40.544 --> 28:42.590
You look lovely tonight.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.766
Don't I always?

28:44.940 --> 28:46.900
You're supposed
to stay at the party.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.640
Darling, you are here,

28:49.815 --> 28:51.294
and handsome as ever.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.253
Black always suited you.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.125
I'm in the middle
of something.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.867
And who is our guest?

28:59.346 --> 29:01.435
I insist on being introduced.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.264
She hasn't been invited
to the party.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.180
But she has been invited to tea.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.444
I'm Lily.
Seymour "the Seer's" assistant.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.536
- Is this a séance?
- Yeah.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.190
Then I am decidedly staying.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.887
But we've already started.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.584
Well, why shouldn't she stay?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.195
See, we've decided.

29:22.673 --> 29:23.849
- Hey...
- Oh, wait.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.948
Not, not in front
of my girlfriend.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.071
- Girlfriend?
- Girlfriend.

29:29.985 --> 29:33.684
But, honey, why haven't
you mentioned her to me?

29:33.859 --> 29:36.383
Yeah, Seymour,
why haven't you mentioned me?

29:38.211 --> 29:40.169
I was busy.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.127
That's silly.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.869
I'm not threatened in the least.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.960
After all,
no one can replace me.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.134
Why not?

29:50.005 --> 29:50.745
No, dear.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.138
Do you have one of those

29:52.312 --> 29:54.749
"we mustn't talk" relationships?

29:54.923 --> 29:56.838
Perhaps you are ready
to continue.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.928
- Oh, of course. I mean...
- Wonderful.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.278
Gerald, would you show Julia
a seat?

30:02.452 --> 30:03.714
Oh...
Got you.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.893
Thank you, sweetie.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.067
Sure.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.639
How close are you
and Julia exactly?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.556
Just about a natural distance.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.210
We've always been close.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.560
I've... I've known her
since I was a child.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.737
In fact, he was the first person
I ever possessed.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.348
- Possessed?
- Oh.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.308
All the time,
and in every available location.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.007
- Why? I remember...
- Julia!

30:35.181 --> 30:36.181
Darling!

30:36.791 --> 30:38.706
How else am I
to handle my competition?

30:38.880 --> 30:42.405
- She's not your...
- Might I remind you time is of the essence?

30:42.579 --> 30:44.451
Stop this distaff tittle-tattle
at once.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.192
No more talking!

30:47.106 --> 30:48.498
No more questions.

30:48.672 --> 30:49.978
No more comments.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.413
Nothing.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.418
Let's hold hands
around the table.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.118
- Lily?
- Yes.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.336
Take my hand.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.949
Oh. All right.

31:04.123 --> 31:06.255
Would you please perform
the incantation for me?

31:07.256 --> 31:08.256
Absolutely.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.783
Spirits, come to Seymour,

31:12.958 --> 31:15.786
keeper of secrets
and teller of lies.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.311
It looks like his girlfriend
is getting wise.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.314
I like it.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.316
Are we channeling Dr. Phil?

31:24.708 --> 31:25.708
Lily.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.668
All right.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.934
Spirits from beyond the veil,

31:33.108 --> 31:35.328
follow my voice and do not fail.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.327
Lily, keep going.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.248
Spirits, awake,

31:42.422 --> 31:44.250
Seymour "the Seer" awaits.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.990
Hear him.

31:46.513 --> 31:47.513
Fear him.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.170
Night be true and clear,
let the tortured one appear.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.870
Jack, arise from the grave.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.306
We are your master.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.221
You are our slave.

32:01.136 --> 32:03.225
Jack, are you with us?

32:04.270 --> 32:05.488
Please give us a sign.

32:13.714 --> 32:16.630
Wow. We asked for a sign,
not a billboard.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.639
Ah! Good evening, everyone.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.686
I trust we're all
prim and proper.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.733
So, we are speaking to Jack?

32:32.907 --> 32:35.736
Mm, you are speaking at me,
Richard.

32:36.432 --> 32:37.868
As is your want.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.658
You know, it was some hard work
getting me out. Cheers.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.748
- So you knew about our difficulty?
- Of course.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.881
- Then you also know the cause.
- Yes.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.883
And who killed you?

32:53.841 --> 32:55.147
A knife killed me.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.063
And what a wonderful surprise
that was.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.629
Talk straight, man!

33:00.456 --> 33:02.502
Are all my souvenirs in place?

33:02.676 --> 33:05.809
What are you doing? Why
are you going through the family safe?

33:06.332 --> 33:08.421
- No one's used that in years.
- Oh.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.205
No one except me.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.688
Ah! It's
always good to have a spare.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.778
You know, the coppers
confiscated my last one.

33:18.648 --> 33:19.910
That's all they got though.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.304
Please tell me
that does not contain

33:22.478 --> 33:24.437
crime scene souvenirs.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.178
All right, I won't.

33:26.961 --> 33:29.877
Did you like
Mary Kelly's scarf?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.140
It matched her eyes.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.231
So, you did hurt those women?

33:36.753 --> 33:38.799
Oh, yes. Well, more than hurt.

33:39.365 --> 33:42.194
Well, at least your victims
are going to... to heaven.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.240
And I helped them get there,
express.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.939
Well, you're going straight
to the bad place.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.854
Not straight to the bad place.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.160
I mean, obviously.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.864
What's your name, crumpet?

34:04.216 --> 34:05.216
Don't be shy.

34:05.956 --> 34:06.956
I don't bite.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.222
- Because I'm dead.
- Might I remind you,

34:10.396 --> 34:12.267
you are in my household.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.356
Your household?

34:14.530 --> 34:16.184
Yes, and under my roof.

34:16.358 --> 34:19.405
I will not allow disrespect
to the weaker sex.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.189
They have enough problems.

34:21.363 --> 34:22.843
Yeah, they do.

34:24.323 --> 34:26.977
But this is your roof?

34:27.152 --> 34:29.545
Wh... What an absurd question.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.376
Because now this roof is mine.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.206
What's happening?

34:38.859 --> 34:40.687
Oh. This is neat.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.647
Stop. There's no way
you have this much power.

34:45.561 --> 34:46.761
You're right.

34:47.694 --> 34:50.566
With this body, I have more.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.829
What is that?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.224
It's time for a new order,

34:56.398 --> 34:59.401
and for new rules
in my kind of fun.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.577
Sorry, Jack. Play time is over.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.975
What was that?

35:08.149 --> 35:10.499
I... That's supposed
to snap you out of it.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.849
You're a pretty one, aren't you?

35:13.241 --> 35:14.547
Uh, sure.

35:15.069 --> 35:17.027
Do you know what I do

35:17.593 --> 35:19.943
- with pretty ones?
- Let them die of old age?

35:21.249 --> 35:22.649
I do let them die.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.342
How dare you?

35:27.864 --> 35:29.083
Wow.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.345
Uh!

35:31.651 --> 35:32.782
Man, I missed.

35:34.175 --> 35:35.175
Let's try again.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.787
Practice, practice, practice.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.807
It's how you get
to help a whore.

35:39.876 --> 35:40.964
Enough!

35:49.103 --> 35:52.237
By power of parchment and pen,

35:52.411 --> 35:54.369
return the way you came in.

35:54.543 --> 35:55.675
I banish you!

35:55.849 --> 35:57.416
Gerald, strike him.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.418
With pleasure.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.074
Jack, you were a lousy brother.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.902
Ah, Gerald.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.210
Still sniveling
over your dead girlfriend,

36:09.384 --> 36:11.125
- with the drinking...
- Hold that thought.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.519
Seymour.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.304
Oh! You banished him.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.524
Oh, let's not speak of it.

36:18.698 --> 36:21.657
- But are you sure that wasn't necessary?
- Don't question my judgment.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.355
He needed to be returned
to the ether.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.096
Hey, you're back.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.969
What happened?

36:29.622 --> 36:31.928
Uh, you attacked Lily
with Cupid.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.102
What?

36:33.408 --> 36:35.628
Well, I, I guess Jack, um,

36:36.194 --> 36:37.891
attacked her, shot love's arrow.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.373
But, but not in a cute
Cupid shuffle kind of way.

36:41.547 --> 36:45.986
It was more of a Dexter:
Valentine's Day Specialway.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.294
Something's screwing with
the natural order of things.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.165
- Excuse me.
- Nonsense.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.690
Everything is, uh,
working exactly as expected.

36:54.864 --> 36:57.302
I gained the sense
of something malevolent.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.869
Maybe that's what
Beatrice meant.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.742
What? Beatrice imparted
a message?

37:03.743 --> 37:06.180
She said that

37:06.615 --> 37:10.967
whatever it was that
was anchoring Jack to this plane

37:11.141 --> 37:13.492
needed to be destroyed,
that it was evil.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.960
I wish
I never agreed to do this.

37:16.973 --> 37:20.760
Jack had more psychic energy
than I have seen anyone have.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.588
But that's impossible.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.591
He's only been dead
for, like, three days.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.898
Amassing that kind of
psychic-kinetic energy takes years.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.639
It takes decades.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.424
Well, he found a way.

37:32.598 --> 37:33.729
Excuse me?

37:34.121 --> 37:34.904
What...

37:35.078 --> 37:36.558
What is going on?

37:37.429 --> 37:40.258
The room,
and Jack and the arrow?

37:40.432 --> 37:41.911
Am I going insane?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.478
Poor thing.

37:44.436 --> 37:46.742
- Tell her.
- Absolutely not.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.440
Tell her everything or I will.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.529
My lips and my tome

37:50.703 --> 37:52.487
- are sealed.
- Perhaps just this...

37:52.661 --> 37:54.181
- What's this...
- We're ghosts.

37:54.663 --> 37:55.663
What?

37:56.361 --> 37:57.361
Julia.

37:58.363 --> 38:02.367
- That is our most closely guarded family secret.
- Please.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.065
How long were you going
to string her along?

38:05.457 --> 38:06.457
An eternity?

38:06.501 --> 38:08.503
It was getting old.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.376
- Ghosts?
- 'Fraid so.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.291
Boo, sweetheart.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.336
But that can't be.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.339
Um, hey, watch this.

38:21.647 --> 38:24.650
Stop that.
Most insensitive.

38:24.824 --> 38:29.176
So Richard is like
the dawn of the family.

38:30.395 --> 38:35.138
And Victoria
is my dead great grandmother.

38:35.922 --> 38:36.966
And Julia...

38:38.403 --> 38:40.405
is Seymour's mother.

38:40.579 --> 38:41.754
His, uh...

38:42.581 --> 38:46.541
And everyone else,
all the partygoers,

38:46.715 --> 38:50.066
they are past generations
of the Auldcrafts

38:50.240 --> 38:56.421
that are all gathered together for a
huge family reunion at Halloween.

38:56.595 --> 39:00.425
Feting me
and the destiny I bequeath them.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.906
And that is why
it is so exclusive.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.909
Because you have to be dead
in order to get in.

39:07.736 --> 39:10.826
So, I think that
about covers it.

39:11.436 --> 39:12.436
That's about it.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.439
We're all on the same page.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.745
But we don't know
who killed Jack.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.269
Or how he acquired that power.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.794
Or if she is worthy
of my Seymour.

39:21.968 --> 39:24.840
I, I, I didn't say
we finished the book.

39:25.232 --> 39:29.454
So this, and you're all and I...

39:31.891 --> 39:33.675
- Uh.
- Oh. Oh.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.852
Excuse me
while I get some smelling salts.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.421
Ghosts!

39:40.595 --> 39:41.944
I was dreaming that I was...

39:42.118 --> 39:45.600
Still here,
and I'm still fabulous.

39:45.774 --> 39:47.689
You're all ghosts!

39:47.863 --> 39:49.387
Um, except for me.

39:50.736 --> 39:51.954
Wow.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.176
I've searched for evidence of
the supernatural my entire life,

39:56.350 --> 39:58.350
and until now, all I could
manage was...

39:58.787 --> 40:00.528
A streaked photograph.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.094
Are you okay?

40:02.965 --> 40:03.965
Okay?

40:04.445 --> 40:05.577
Wow. I am great.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.101
I should be recording this.

40:08.275 --> 40:09.885
Well, now that you know,

40:10.582 --> 40:14.281
I should relay the entire
Auldcraft family history.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.722
The Auldcraft family...
Excuse me, dear.

40:20.896 --> 40:26.206
The Auldcraft family came
to this land over 200 years ago

40:26.380 --> 40:29.296
searching for opportunity,
and we found it like most.

40:29.470 --> 40:32.604
Richard founded
the Auldcraft family fortune

40:32.778 --> 40:34.649
and built this lovely mansion,

40:34.823 --> 40:37.347
and he found a way
to keep us together,

40:37.522 --> 40:40.002
even after death.
Isn't that wonderful?

40:40.176 --> 40:44.354
All the Auldcrafts fly
to the mansion after passing,

40:44.746 --> 40:46.269
and they share rooms,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.663
and the generations
tell stories.

40:48.837 --> 40:52.841
Seymour, you knew
about the ghosts?

40:53.189 --> 40:56.236
Of course he knew. All the
Auldcrafts know the family history.

40:57.150 --> 41:00.240
Seymour. This is incredible.
Why didn't you tell me?

41:01.110 --> 41:05.332
This... ...is
not some idle fireside gossip.

41:05.506 --> 41:09.597
This is a treasured family's
secret, at least until now.

41:10.642 --> 41:13.775
Seymour, they're ghosts
you can see.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.864
Please do try to keep up.

41:16.996 --> 41:20.260
We've recorded
low-register moaning, flickers.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.131
Now I can prove everything.

41:24.090 --> 41:25.610
There's one more thing
you should know.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.659
Don't you dare!

41:28.442 --> 41:29.811
She should know
what we're dealing with.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.581
Is nothing sacred?

41:37.190 --> 41:40.193
Lily, meet
the Auldcraft family sigil.

41:40.759 --> 41:43.457
It's the key
to our way of life after death.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.286
Wow. Explain how it works.

41:47.069 --> 41:50.149
Any name written in the sigil will be
kept from traveling to the great beyond.

41:50.203 --> 41:52.901
The ultimate family scrapbook.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.947
Seymour, I don't see your name.

41:55.382 --> 41:56.382
Well, I'm not on it.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.516
I appear to be immune somehow.

41:58.864 --> 42:02.694
But once a name is added
to the sigil...

42:02.868 --> 42:04.957
It is bound to this house
until death.

42:06.306 --> 42:10.049
Then what happened to Jack?
I mean, Jonathan Theodore?

42:10.440 --> 42:11.964
I can still read his name.

42:12.138 --> 42:13.835
Although it's faint.

42:14.009 --> 42:16.272
I have the power
to banish any soul

42:16.446 --> 42:18.405
bound in the sigil to the ether.

42:18.927 --> 42:20.668
What exactly is the ether?

42:20.842 --> 42:23.149
It's like
a supernatural drunk tank.

42:25.586 --> 42:29.285
In theory, Jack should have gone
straight to the bad place,

42:29.938 --> 42:31.778
but, instead, he's able
to linger in the ether.

42:31.810 --> 42:34.552
Why doesn't
he appear on his own?

42:34.900 --> 42:37.772
Uh, why does he need
to go through you?

42:37.946 --> 42:40.079
That's the thing.
It doesn't make sense.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.648
Unless the sigil is acting
like some sort of transmitter.

42:43.822 --> 42:45.040
We have to find out.

42:45.780 --> 42:48.478
Seymour, you will have
to channel Jack again.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.829
You serious?
After what I almost did to her?

42:51.003 --> 42:52.570
I think I'll pass.

42:52.744 --> 42:56.617
Yes, that's what you do,
Seymour. You pass.

42:56.791 --> 43:00.012
I am deceased and I have more
of a life than you do.

43:00.186 --> 43:03.755
Richard Auldcraft, you have not
blessed this family.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.106
- You've cursed it.
- Oh, pfft.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.587
There you go
with your, your lies.

43:09.761 --> 43:11.327
I did nothing of the sort.

43:11.501 --> 43:13.373
Ghosts are my profession,
all right?

43:13.547 --> 43:15.549
I can recognize a curse
when I see a curse.

43:15.723 --> 43:19.640
The sigil is not a curse.
It's a blessing.

43:19.814 --> 43:22.469
Mm. And how did you attain this
blessing? Why don't you tell us?

43:24.297 --> 43:27.605
I am amazing!

43:28.823 --> 43:30.042
You met someone.

43:31.086 --> 43:32.086
What happened?

43:34.394 --> 43:38.746
After I made my fortune
in molasses and whale oil...

43:38.920 --> 43:42.141
Believe me, you don't want to
get those two bottles confused.

43:42.315 --> 43:44.970
I wanted to build
a mansion big enough to...

43:45.144 --> 43:48.408
house the entire
family for generations,

43:48.582 --> 43:50.671
and that's when I met the angel.

43:51.411 --> 43:53.369
And how did you know
he was an angel?

43:53.718 --> 43:55.110
Uh, big wings,

43:55.284 --> 43:58.287
he carried a quill
and a scale of justice.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.899
It reminded me of a lawyer.
Uh...

44:01.769 --> 44:04.598
I signed a covenant
that suspended judgment

44:04.772 --> 44:07.949
upon death indefinitely
for me and my heirs.

44:10.212 --> 44:11.212
Richard.

44:12.693 --> 44:16.392
There's only one kind of angel
that has scales.

44:18.351 --> 44:19.439
Fallen angels.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.398
Who are commonly known

44:23.051 --> 44:24.313
as demons.

44:24.487 --> 44:26.838
- I need a drink.
- Preposterous.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.667
We've been fine
for hundreds of years.

44:29.841 --> 44:30.841
Yeah.

44:31.886 --> 44:34.280
But now Jack is coming
to kill us all.

44:35.803 --> 44:37.892
You haven't blessed this family.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.111
You've cursed it.

44:39.589 --> 44:40.590
How dare you?

44:41.461 --> 44:45.030
How dare you accuse me
of such a calumny?

44:46.031 --> 44:48.163
You put this entire family
in danger,

44:48.337 --> 44:50.035
our very mortal souls.

44:50.209 --> 44:51.906
If you had a sense of honor,

44:52.080 --> 44:53.995
you would undo
what you have done.

44:54.169 --> 44:57.172
How dare you speak
to me of honor?

44:57.346 --> 44:59.261
You, of all people?

44:59.958 --> 45:01.438
What's happening?

45:01.524 --> 45:05.441
Your very birth
besmirched the family honor!

45:06.007 --> 45:07.705
Richard, listen to me for once.

45:07.879 --> 45:10.229
And what exactly
would you have me do?

45:10.403 --> 45:13.885
- You need to destroy the sigil!
- Destroy it?

45:14.450 --> 45:16.104
The sigil is our way
of afterlife.

45:16.626 --> 45:17.626
Destroy it.

45:18.846 --> 45:22.241
Cease this, cease this at once!

45:22.415 --> 45:24.678
Richard, calm down.
You're gonna pop a lightbulb.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.767
Oh! Too late!

45:26.941 --> 45:29.204
Richard, no.

45:32.077 --> 45:34.079
Don't hurt my baby.

45:34.253 --> 45:38.300
There's more than one way
to deal with a pest.

45:39.258 --> 45:41.608
Victoria, do something.

45:42.087 --> 45:42.827
Help him.

45:43.001 --> 45:44.089
This ends now!

45:44.263 --> 45:45.263
- No!
- Sigil.

45:46.918 --> 45:51.270
Sigil, by the power of parchment
and pen, release Richard.

45:53.228 --> 45:54.229
What are you doing?

45:55.274 --> 45:58.973
Sigil, I command you,
release Richard Auldcraft.

46:01.323 --> 46:03.064
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I...

46:03.238 --> 46:06.111
The big cheese eaten
just like that.

46:06.285 --> 46:08.417
I didn't,
I didn't think that would work.

46:08.591 --> 46:10.593
- You banished him.
- I...

46:11.116 --> 46:13.640
Oh, my deepest apologies.
I panicked.

46:13.814 --> 46:15.294
Well, you panicked like a fox.

46:15.468 --> 46:17.339
He was gonna kill Seymour.

46:17.513 --> 46:18.732
Oh, we don't know that.

46:18.906 --> 46:21.300
What? He wasn't gonna use
that candlestick

46:21.474 --> 46:22.910
for a candle at dinner.

46:23.345 --> 46:25.565
Well, he isn't here
to defend himself,

46:25.739 --> 46:27.828
so let's just,
let's just drop the matter.

46:28.002 --> 46:30.613
- Did he go to the bad place?
- No.

46:31.353 --> 46:33.181
The sigil says,
"Unfinished business."

46:34.052 --> 46:36.010
He's anchored in the ether
just like Jack.

46:37.229 --> 46:39.709
Why didn't you mention
something about that earlier?

46:39.884 --> 46:42.974
I, I got drunk
at the Devil's party.

46:43.583 --> 46:46.263
I mean, th... this isn't gonna look
good in the big book in the sky.

46:46.412 --> 46:48.109
There's not much you can do.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.025
Without Richard here, I...

46:51.547 --> 46:53.506
I needed him
to destroy the sigil.

46:54.637 --> 46:56.509
- Pardon?
- Why?

46:57.249 --> 46:58.772
They're tied together.

46:59.555 --> 47:00.555
He created the covenant,

47:00.687 --> 47:01.949
only he can rescind it.

47:03.951 --> 47:05.735
If he did agree,
what would you have done?

47:07.607 --> 47:09.652
Well, we would've
reenacted the ceremony

47:09.827 --> 47:11.698
and reversed the sequence
of events.

47:12.873 --> 47:14.919
Then we're stuck here
without him.

47:15.484 --> 47:16.484
Yeah.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.140
What... You couldn't have
mentioned that

47:19.314 --> 47:20.533
in the heat of the argument?

47:20.707 --> 47:22.187
Well, he was busy yelling.

47:23.492 --> 47:26.147
Are you sure
there's no other way?

47:26.495 --> 47:29.803
Uh, okay.
What if we call the Devil

47:30.630 --> 47:34.068
and complain about the warranty
on this thing?

47:34.242 --> 47:37.071
There's... No, we...

47:37.245 --> 47:39.682
Okay, look, you've got magic.

47:40.596 --> 47:43.512
Wave your hands, make sparks.

47:43.686 --> 47:44.686
Look.

47:45.775 --> 47:46.776
Kapow!

47:47.212 --> 47:48.474
Goodbye, sigil, right?

47:50.128 --> 47:53.696
There is a small possibility that I
could destroy it without Richard's help.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.002
Right. Oh.

47:55.176 --> 47:57.178
Then let's do it. Kapow!

47:57.352 --> 47:58.876
But there's a large possibility

47:59.050 --> 48:01.226
that I could send everyone
down to the bad place.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.184
- Well, let's just hold that thought.
- Yeah.

48:03.663 --> 48:07.449
Curses are more difficult to deal
with than frizzy hair on a humid day.

48:07.623 --> 48:08.929
Well, it's not a curse.

48:09.103 --> 48:10.931
It, it may have
started out like that,

48:11.105 --> 48:15.109
but, but it's done nothing
but good things for our family.

48:15.718 --> 48:19.070
At the end of the day, it keeps you
from going to where you need to be.

48:19.635 --> 48:21.855
No, it keeps us together.

48:22.638 --> 48:26.599
Yeah, but now we're together with
the spirit of a cold-blooded murderer.

48:26.773 --> 48:30.820
Well, I can't be held
accountable for modern schooling.

48:31.821 --> 48:33.998
If Richard's still here,
What if you channeled him?

48:34.520 --> 48:35.825
Could he revoke the sigil, then?

48:36.478 --> 48:39.003
I mean, yeah,
but not if he doesn't want to.

48:39.568 --> 48:43.050
Let me talk to him. I may be
able to change his perspective.

48:43.224 --> 48:46.358
I tried changing that
perspective for my entire life.

48:46.532 --> 48:50.405
And I have been successfully
changing it well beyond that.

48:51.363 --> 48:54.018
Okay...
Hold on.

48:59.806 --> 49:00.807
I can see Jack.

49:02.287 --> 49:03.679
He... He's waiting for me.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.303
He wants
to possess me permanently.

49:07.379 --> 49:08.859
And he will
if I try to channel again.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.208
How can he do that?

49:10.860 --> 49:11.860
Sigil?

49:13.907 --> 49:17.041
The sigil
is just a piece of paper.

49:17.911 --> 49:19.304
Heaven help us if it's not.

49:19.478 --> 49:21.654
Julia, how do names
get on the sigil?

49:22.524 --> 49:24.526
Only Richard understood
how it works.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.746
Sometimes a name appears
at birth,

49:27.181 --> 49:30.576
sometimes at marriage,
and sometimes even after death.

49:30.750 --> 49:33.753
So we really are out of options?

49:34.362 --> 49:35.711
What can we do?

49:37.322 --> 49:40.455
There is one technique I know,
but it's extremely dangerous,

49:40.629 --> 49:44.372
and it could, it could hurt
everybody, living or dead.

49:44.546 --> 49:45.678
Please tell us.

49:46.287 --> 49:49.160
I've practiced
some of the ancient studies,

49:49.334 --> 49:50.422
and these...

49:51.162 --> 49:53.482
...are ways that
a priest would consult the dead.

49:54.730 --> 49:55.862
- Okay.
- Like what?

49:56.036 --> 49:58.038
So I'm gonna have to go out

49:58.212 --> 50:00.475
and buy some, uh, goat's blood

50:00.649 --> 50:02.260
No. No.

50:02.869 --> 50:06.742
They used visual means
to consult with them.

50:07.439 --> 50:09.759
Passed for the ghosts to go on
to appear before the living.

50:10.268 --> 50:11.660
Doors to the other side.

50:12.618 --> 50:17.579
We could communicate with Richard's
spirit and reverse the ceremony?

50:18.493 --> 50:20.104
In theory.

50:20.278 --> 50:23.063
Direct links to the afterlife
are notoriously unstable.

50:24.108 --> 50:29.026
But if someone
were to go through the door,

50:29.200 --> 50:31.463
they could find Richard
and retrieve him.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.334
Yes.

50:34.640 --> 50:38.209
In fact, that would be safer than me
going in and opening the door myself.

50:38.861 --> 50:41.038
That's all I need to hear.
I'm going.

50:41.777 --> 50:42.996
You?

50:43.170 --> 50:44.519
I'm the one
that banished Richard.

50:44.693 --> 50:46.173
I should be the one
to bring him back.

50:46.695 --> 50:47.957
You'd risk death?

50:48.132 --> 50:50.090
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm already dead.

50:52.832 --> 50:55.922
But I, I have no idea what
will happen if I attempt this.

50:56.357 --> 50:58.664
Uh, you could be lost forever
in the haze

50:58.838 --> 51:01.623
between the phy... physical
and the spiritual realms.

51:02.711 --> 51:04.974
We have to control
this power, Seymour.

51:05.149 --> 51:06.976
It must not control us.

51:08.326 --> 51:09.109
All right.

51:09.283 --> 51:10.850
Everybody, stand back.

51:13.287 --> 51:14.462
But before I depart,

51:15.202 --> 51:18.466
I would like
to go see the family.

51:19.032 --> 51:22.949
- Why?
- They really should know that Richard's passed and...

51:23.776 --> 51:27.258
Well, I'd like to say my farewells
in case something happens.

51:27.432 --> 51:30.130
I'll go with you. Give me a
minute to calibrate my ectometer.

51:30.304 --> 51:33.133
Dear, dear, I'm so sorry, but this
really must be restricted to family.

51:34.134 --> 51:35.701
And I am not family.

51:35.875 --> 51:36.919
I understand.

51:38.399 --> 51:40.009
- Gerald?
- Yeah.

51:40.184 --> 51:42.273
Would you escort me, please?

51:43.970 --> 51:46.364
My parents are out there.

51:46.538 --> 51:47.538
You know that, right?

51:47.669 --> 51:48.670
Yes, of course.

51:49.236 --> 51:53.458
I never exactly saw
eye to eye with them

51:53.632 --> 51:55.286
even when they had eyes.

51:55.938 --> 51:59.159
As the oldest living
representative of the family.

52:01.988 --> 52:04.077
Let's rock.

52:04.512 --> 52:07.124
- Seymour, you go too.
- Me?

52:07.689 --> 52:10.475
I'll stay here
and keep Lily company.

52:10.649 --> 52:12.694
We'll have
a beating-heart-to-heart talk.

52:12.868 --> 52:16.133
- Ah...
- See? She loves the idea.

52:16.307 --> 52:17.307
Hurry along.

52:21.399 --> 52:25.446
- Uh...
- Now, how long have you known my Seymour?

52:26.404 --> 52:27.492
Three years.

52:28.057 --> 52:30.016
I have a degree
in linguistic archaeology,

52:30.190 --> 52:33.193
and we met when I was writing
my thesis on talking in tongues.

52:33.976 --> 52:35.239
Ah, yes,

52:35.717 --> 52:38.198
another of Seymour's
many talents.

52:38.372 --> 52:41.070
It's not every boyfriend
who can tweet in Biblical Greek.

52:41.767 --> 52:44.291
And you've dated him
all that time?

52:44.770 --> 52:45.770
For the past year.

52:46.206 --> 52:48.165
Until then, I was his assistant.

52:48.730 --> 52:50.776
- In the ghost trade?
- Yes.

52:51.777 --> 52:54.127
- And you enjoy your profession?
- I love it.

52:54.649 --> 52:55.649
Why?

52:56.347 --> 53:00.133
- Uh...
- Surely, dear, I'm asking honestly.

53:02.222 --> 53:04.442
Well, sometimes
people need a second chance,

53:04.616 --> 53:07.575
but death's a barrier
they can't cross.

53:08.228 --> 53:11.405
Yes, the River Styx flows
only one way.

53:11.579 --> 53:14.887
Seymour comes in, helps
everyone say what they need to say.

53:15.409 --> 53:16.584
You enjoy that.

53:17.019 --> 53:18.673
I can't describe the thrill.

53:19.674 --> 53:22.111
When we help,
everything feels brighter.

53:22.895 --> 53:24.735
The only thing
that I love more than that is...

53:26.768 --> 53:28.553
Your hair is a lovely, my dear,

53:29.075 --> 53:31.904
- but you really should do something with it.
- Excuse me?

53:32.513 --> 53:34.428
I am sorry, that came out wrong.

53:34.994 --> 53:37.562
I mean, you should change
your hairstyle

53:37.997 --> 53:39.216
while you still can.

53:39.781 --> 53:40.869
What's wrong with it?

53:41.609 --> 53:44.308
Once you're dead, you're frozen
in your present state.

53:45.047 --> 53:48.312
I've been making this dress work
for 20 years.

53:48.877 --> 53:51.837
Believe me, don't worry
about dying in clean underwear.

53:52.011 --> 53:53.578
Worry about your hair.

53:54.753 --> 53:56.798
- Twenty years?
- Yes.

53:57.190 --> 53:58.322
Seymour is 20.

53:58.974 --> 53:59.975
He is.

54:00.149 --> 54:02.369
How time flies when you're dead.

54:03.631 --> 54:05.242
You died when he was born?

54:06.025 --> 54:07.244
Only a few months after.

54:08.288 --> 54:09.420
Wha... What happened?

54:11.683 --> 54:14.990
Well... when I got pregnant,

54:15.382 --> 54:17.210
marriage was out
of the question.

54:18.167 --> 54:20.909
Not because I wasn't lovely.

54:21.083 --> 54:22.128
You understand?

54:23.042 --> 54:25.653
But because the father
was already married.

54:26.437 --> 54:28.221
Everyone was terribly upset.

54:29.222 --> 54:31.050
But I insisted
on keeping the baby.

54:31.964 --> 54:33.139
Then I died.

54:34.183 --> 54:36.098
How? How did you die?

54:40.451 --> 54:42.148
I can't seem to recall.

54:42.801 --> 54:44.281
Try to remember, Julia.

54:45.020 --> 54:46.300
I have a feeling it's important.

54:47.762 --> 54:49.111
I remember that Richard and I

54:49.286 --> 54:51.723
had just had
a spectacular fight.

54:51.897 --> 54:52.897
Over what?

54:53.812 --> 54:55.292
It seems trivial now,

54:55.466 --> 54:57.859
but Richard refused
to register Seymour's name

54:58.033 --> 55:00.384
in the family Bible
with the other Auldcrafts.

55:06.955 --> 55:08.261
I remember now.

55:09.349 --> 55:10.742
It's coming back to me.

55:12.744 --> 55:14.920
I snuck back into the library

55:15.094 --> 55:17.444
to add Seymour's name
to the family Bible.

55:18.924 --> 55:21.056
I decided I didn't need
Richard's approval.

55:22.449 --> 55:24.103
Julia.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.062
Julia.

55:27.585 --> 55:28.585
Richard.

55:29.456 --> 55:31.197
Julia.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.374
Richard, is that you?

55:34.853 --> 55:37.943
Julia, what are you doing?

55:38.726 --> 55:41.033
I'm adding Seymour's name
to the family Bible,

55:41.207 --> 55:42.904
and you can't stop me.

55:43.078 --> 55:45.907
It doesn't work that way, Julia.

55:46.081 --> 55:47.474
He's an Auldcraft,

55:47.866 --> 55:49.868
just like
all the other Auldcrafts.

55:50.042 --> 55:53.567
I agree that
Seymour is a very special boy,

55:53.741 --> 55:56.962
and he should be raised
in a very special way.

55:57.136 --> 55:58.746
So you will add his name.

55:59.225 --> 56:02.228
Eventually,
his name will be inscribed

56:02.402 --> 56:05.100
with the others on the list,
I promise you.

56:06.667 --> 56:07.973
That's not good enough.

56:08.452 --> 56:10.628
I want his name
written down tonight,

56:10.802 --> 56:13.544
or I will leave this house in the
morning and take Seymour with me.

56:13.892 --> 56:16.155
Poor little Julia,

56:16.590 --> 56:18.810
I can see you're upset.

56:19.985 --> 56:22.291
You know I always get my way.

56:22.466 --> 56:24.903
So do I.

56:25.686 --> 56:29.168
I think you should go outside
and take a walk.

56:46.664 --> 56:47.708
Now I remember.

56:50.319 --> 56:51.930
I died in the cemetery.

56:52.539 --> 56:54.019
Covered in the winter's snow.

56:54.193 --> 56:55.760
How horrible.

56:56.543 --> 57:00.155
After I died, parties were out
of the question, of course,

57:00.329 --> 57:01.896
except for Halloween.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.596
And I realized,
I could still raise Seymour.

57:06.205 --> 57:07.206
How?

57:07.772 --> 57:09.991
Which was difficult,
but we made it work.

57:10.949 --> 57:13.908
I would possess him in
the morning and make breakfast.

57:14.082 --> 57:16.084
Then un-possess him
in time for school.

57:16.911 --> 57:21.568
And every night, I would float over
his bed and moan bedtime stories.

57:21.742 --> 57:24.658
So you raised Seymour
even though you are a ghost?

57:26.747 --> 57:30.490
There's something about tonight
that reminds me of the time I died.

57:32.274 --> 57:34.189
But the memory is out of reach.

57:35.190 --> 57:37.584
The figure
on the other side of a window.

57:40.587 --> 57:41.588
No, no, no, no.

57:42.197 --> 57:44.330
How about those shapeshifters?

57:44.504 --> 57:46.506
Oh, talk
about your party animals.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.727
And did you catch that
xylophoning skeleton band?

57:50.249 --> 57:51.642
Oh, I hope they party that hard

57:51.816 --> 57:53.774
- when they find out I died.
- Ah.

57:53.948 --> 57:55.559
They were excited.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.648
Oh, they would have been
hopping up and down

57:57.822 --> 58:00.085
if they had their feet.

58:00.259 --> 58:03.436
Richard obviously made quite
an impression throughout the ages.

58:03.610 --> 58:07.092
Oh, there were
some 19th century cuss words

58:07.266 --> 58:09.921
that they needed to get off their chest.

58:10.095 --> 58:12.967
You would think mature manifestations
could manage their decorum.

58:13.359 --> 58:18.712
Well, and instead it's This
House is Cleansed dance party.

58:19.583 --> 58:22.934
Well, I'm just glad that they're
taking my imminent departure

58:23.108 --> 58:24.370
in a more subdued manner.

58:26.546 --> 58:27.546
What's up with you two?

58:28.417 --> 58:29.506
Just girl talk.

58:30.594 --> 58:32.987
- Julia raised you as a ghost?
- Mm, yeah.

58:33.771 --> 58:34.771
Whole life.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.228
Do you think that's
where your gift came from?

58:37.252 --> 58:39.646
I mean,

58:39.820 --> 58:42.562
not a lot of people grow up
being constantly possessed.

58:42.736 --> 58:44.259
So maybe...

58:44.608 --> 58:46.174
And it wasn't just Julia.

58:46.653 --> 58:50.048
The whole family took advantage
of his channeling skills.

58:50.657 --> 58:54.008
We just so rarely have a chance
to interact with the living.

58:54.879 --> 58:57.229
I was the youngest guy
had a lot of bridge matches.

58:57.403 --> 59:00.972
The look on some of
those ladies' faces when he won.

59:01.146 --> 59:05.542
Oh, I also got kicked
out of Civil War Historical Societies.

59:05.933 --> 59:08.370
Well, they never knew
who he was gonna argue for,

59:08.545 --> 59:10.242
the north or the south.

59:10.416 --> 59:13.811
So yes, it's, it's,
it's certainly possible

59:13.985 --> 59:17.597
that Seymour's powers emanated
from his unique childhood.

59:17.771 --> 59:19.947
Do you think that's why
you're not named on the sigil?

59:21.079 --> 59:25.213
I mean, it could be, but a lot of people
just are passed over for some reason.

59:26.214 --> 59:29.914
You had this whole amazing life
and you never told me.

59:31.132 --> 59:32.412
I promised to keep their secret.

59:33.221 --> 59:34.221
I'm glad I know.

59:35.310 --> 59:38.052
Seymour was raised
in a very loving family,

59:38.923 --> 59:40.794
albeit a, a little peculiar.

59:41.490 --> 59:43.405
I do love your spin, Gran.

59:45.538 --> 59:46.538
Well...

59:47.322 --> 59:48.802
I think I'm ready.

59:49.324 --> 59:50.935
Any final advice?

59:51.109 --> 59:52.197
Oh. Yes.

59:53.241 --> 59:56.549
Proper penmanship is important
to both the living and the dead.

59:58.029 --> 1:00:00.118
And a freshly ironed shirt
is never cause for regret.

1:00:00.292 --> 1:00:02.120
Okay, iron shirts, check.

1:00:02.294 --> 1:00:05.297
A... And, uh, parents shouldn't
argue in front of the children.

1:00:05.471 --> 1:00:08.692
Okay, if, if I promise to read Emily
Post, can we just get on with it?

1:00:10.781 --> 1:00:11.781
Well...

1:00:13.087 --> 1:00:14.306
it's been a lovely life

1:00:14.915 --> 1:00:16.134
and an even better death.

1:00:18.919 --> 1:00:21.182
Do the Auldcraft family proud.

1:00:22.488 --> 1:00:23.488
All right.

1:00:24.403 --> 1:00:25.622
How do we proceed?

1:00:25.796 --> 1:00:27.624
Oh, please tell me
she has to knock

1:00:27.798 --> 1:00:28.799
"Shave and a Haircut."

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.000
Simply open the door.

1:00:34.587 --> 1:00:36.850
- Seymour, it's not working.
- Seymour.

1:00:37.024 --> 1:00:39.505
- There's too much interference.
- Oh.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:41.855
- Victoria, you have to keep trying.
- I'm trying.

1:00:42.029 --> 1:00:43.869
Seymour, stop this.
She isn't going to make it.

1:00:44.031 --> 1:00:45.467
Victoria, you have
to open the door.

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:47.600
I can't reach the door.

1:00:47.774 --> 1:00:49.384
Victoria!

1:00:51.386 --> 1:00:52.779
That wasn't supposed to happen.

1:00:54.825 --> 1:00:57.281
It didn't. She's in
the beyond, but the door failed.

1:00:57.305 --> 1:00:58.742
Can she speak to Richard?

1:00:58.916 --> 1:01:00.134
I mean, yeah, but, uh,

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.049
without a stable working door,

1:01:02.223 --> 1:01:03.503
I can't get either of them back.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:04.878
Well, can you do it again?

1:01:06.793 --> 1:01:07.838
I can sense Jack

1:01:08.447 --> 1:01:09.447
What's he doing?

1:01:09.535 --> 1:01:10.971
He wants to come back.

1:01:11.842 --> 1:01:13.642
And he'll come through
if I open another door.

1:01:14.671 --> 1:01:15.671
What can we do?

1:01:17.499 --> 1:01:18.587
I have to think.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.852
Seymour, I love you.

1:01:23.288 --> 1:01:25.551
But there's something
that bothers me.

1:01:26.204 --> 1:01:30.034
- What?
- This is a freaking piece of paper.

1:01:30.208 --> 1:01:33.690
It doesn't take woo-woo magic
to destroy it.

1:01:33.864 --> 1:01:37.258
It just takes
two functioning hands.

1:01:37.432 --> 1:01:41.262
Let's destroy
Richard's demon love letter now.

1:01:41.436 --> 1:01:44.439
Gerald, I've told you this.
It's extremely dangerous.

1:01:44.613 --> 1:01:47.747
Well, and, and I'm sure
to your handwaving magic,

1:01:48.226 --> 1:01:50.707
this is probably stupid,
but look at this.

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:56.016
Is it putting up
much of a struggle?

1:01:56.930 --> 1:02:00.107
Does this look dangerous,
scary to you?

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:03.110
- Gerald, put that back right now.
- Or what?

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.112
I'm gonna get a paper cut?

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:09.813
Beatrice told me
to destroy this thing,

1:02:09.987 --> 1:02:11.292
and I'm going to do it

1:02:11.945 --> 1:02:15.601
for her and for all lost loves!

1:02:15.775 --> 1:02:18.778
- Gerald...
- You have caused enough trouble.

1:02:19.779 --> 1:02:21.520
- Time to go by bye-bye.
- Gerald, stop!

1:02:22.782 --> 1:02:25.567
- I ain't afraid of no dead ghost!
- Don't. Stop!

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:27.502
- Gerald...
- You don't know...

1:02:27.526 --> 1:02:29.199
- what you're doing.
- ...it's watching you.

1:02:29.223 --> 1:02:31.791
No, it's making
the room do the samba.

1:02:31.965 --> 1:02:34.402
- Take it.
- You maniac, give it back.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:36.013
- Time to go rippity-rip.
- No!

1:02:51.724 --> 1:02:53.030
And you can see me.

1:02:54.118 --> 1:02:55.162
I'm not invisible.

1:02:55.815 --> 1:02:56.815
I can see you.

1:02:57.817 --> 1:03:00.689
And I'm not floating.
Tell me I'm not floating.

1:03:01.473 --> 1:03:02.517
You're not floating

1:03:03.257 --> 1:03:05.433
You know,
that's something, I guess.

1:03:05.607 --> 1:03:08.393
Not only did it kill me,
but it made a mess.

1:03:08.567 --> 1:03:10.699
I'm sorry,
I can't help clean up.

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:12.571
Like you would have anyway.

1:03:14.312 --> 1:03:15.661
This is so weak.

1:03:16.705 --> 1:03:21.101
You know, I kind of remember
telling you not to touch the sigil.

1:03:21.710 --> 1:03:24.409
It was a piece of paper.

1:03:24.583 --> 1:03:27.412
It's a piece of paper
created by a demon.

1:03:29.588 --> 1:03:31.329
The party is picking back up.

1:03:32.112 --> 1:03:33.418
Should we tell them to stop?

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:35.986
I don't see
what good it would do.

1:03:38.379 --> 1:03:41.165
Let 'em play the wailing waltz
as long as they can.

1:03:44.603 --> 1:03:45.603
You know something?

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:50.043
Being a ghost sobers you up.

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:51.217
Yeah?

1:03:53.612 --> 1:03:55.875
It's my worst nightmare
realized.

1:03:57.703 --> 1:03:59.270
You know, that really sucks.

1:04:00.488 --> 1:04:02.360
I kind of wish I had warned you.

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:05.469
You know, maybe it would've prevented
you from doing something stupid.

1:04:05.493 --> 1:04:06.493
Yeah, well...

1:04:07.626 --> 1:04:10.194
smack me upside the head
if you can find my body.

1:04:11.543 --> 1:04:12.761
What was that?

1:04:15.112 --> 1:04:16.112
That's Jack.

1:04:17.288 --> 1:04:18.288
Look at the sigil.

1:04:18.811 --> 1:04:21.422
Oh! Wow, it's, it's Vegas style.

1:04:22.206 --> 1:04:23.511
Jack is coming back.

1:04:24.121 --> 1:04:25.121
Yeah, and soon.

1:04:26.253 --> 1:04:28.429
Why couldn't he have been
an evil botanist?

1:04:29.604 --> 1:04:34.218
Then we could be tormented
in an evil rose garden.

1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:37.699
I don't think the Devil's
interested in foliage.

1:04:38.048 --> 1:04:40.398
Well, he started off wrapped
around a tree, didn't he?

1:04:40.964 --> 1:04:43.836
Is there anything we can do
to prevent Jack from returning?

1:04:44.402 --> 1:04:45.620
Or defend ourselves.

1:04:46.752 --> 1:04:47.752
I don't know.

1:04:48.667 --> 1:04:51.409
Um, not that it matters,
now that I'm a ghost.

1:04:52.062 --> 1:04:53.062
Uh...

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.066
There are ways
to torture ghosts.

1:04:58.111 --> 1:04:59.983
And I'm hearing about this now.

1:05:01.549 --> 1:05:03.421
- Strange.
- What?

1:05:04.552 --> 1:05:06.772
Nothing. Never mind.

1:05:09.209 --> 1:05:12.125
It felt like someone
just walked over my grave.

1:05:13.170 --> 1:05:14.562
The way this night is going,

1:05:15.259 --> 1:05:17.783
someone probably drove
a hummer over it.

1:05:19.350 --> 1:05:20.350
Hey, I've got it.

1:05:21.526 --> 1:05:23.397
Channel a marine to fight him.

1:05:24.703 --> 1:05:25.834
You're kidding.

1:05:26.009 --> 1:05:28.228
Well, we can,

1:05:28.402 --> 1:05:29.969
we can use
night creature goggles

1:05:30.143 --> 1:05:32.885
and attack 'em
with ectoplasmic grenades.

1:05:33.407 --> 1:05:36.106
That, that's not how this works,
though.

1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:38.151
That's not
how any of this works.

1:05:38.543 --> 1:05:41.328
Well, call Casper then,
I hear he's friendly.

1:05:41.502 --> 1:05:42.502
No, he's not.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:46.855
What kind
of busted Ghostbuster argue?

1:05:48.031 --> 1:05:50.076
The kind that's responsible.

1:05:50.772 --> 1:05:52.209
Julia.

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:54.907
You seem distracted.

1:05:55.386 --> 1:05:56.474
Sorry.

1:05:57.779 --> 1:05:59.172
Almost as if...

1:06:01.435 --> 1:06:02.435
Kids...

1:06:03.655 --> 1:06:06.353
you may want to get out of
here while you're still alive.

1:06:06.527 --> 1:06:07.528
I'm not leaving.

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:08.790
So neither am I.

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:16.015
Good evening.

1:06:16.189 --> 1:06:18.278
Richard, how are you back?

1:06:18.452 --> 1:06:23.501
Please don't compare
me to that bumptious buffoon.

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:25.590
You sound like Richard.

1:06:26.504 --> 1:06:27.504
Who are you?

1:06:30.421 --> 1:06:31.596
The sigil.

1:06:31.770 --> 1:06:34.860
So, you do remember me.

1:06:35.513 --> 1:06:37.906
You were the voice
that spoke to me when I died.

1:06:38.081 --> 1:06:39.299
Of course.

1:06:41.171 --> 1:06:43.086
Why are you
showing yourself now?

1:06:43.260 --> 1:06:44.870
Now that Richard is gone,

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:47.916
it's not possible
to reverse the ceremony

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:49.527
that created me.

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:53.618
Yeah, yeah.
We've had all kinds of bad news.

1:06:53.792 --> 1:06:56.534
Oh, and, hey,
thanks for killing me.

1:06:56.708 --> 1:06:59.189
I had to protect myself.

1:06:59.363 --> 1:07:02.192
Well, next time try lamination.

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:06.544
Stop trying to keep me at bay.

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:07.980
How noble.

1:07:08.459 --> 1:07:10.591
Forgive me. Wrong word.

1:07:10.765 --> 1:07:12.419
Pathetic!

1:07:13.290 --> 1:07:14.639
I can hold you off.

1:07:15.205 --> 1:07:17.468
We both know that's not true.

1:07:17.642 --> 1:07:22.081
I'm gathering power
even as we speak.

1:07:22.255 --> 1:07:25.171
How would you like
to spend the rest of your days

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:28.348
stapled to the back
of a Chinese takeout menu?

1:07:28.522 --> 1:07:30.133
Such theatrics,

1:07:30.742 --> 1:07:33.832
just like your little friend.

1:07:35.007 --> 1:07:38.271
- Beatrice?
- Too bad about her little accident.

1:07:38.445 --> 1:07:40.708
I'm sure
she would appreciate the irony

1:07:40.882 --> 1:07:42.710
of dying in a cemetery.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:45.365
You killed Beatrice?

1:07:46.584 --> 1:07:50.414
- Why?
- Every haunted mansion needs a drunken caretaker.

1:07:52.329 --> 1:07:53.504
It's a tradition,

1:07:53.678 --> 1:07:55.593
and like
dearly departed Richard,

1:07:55.767 --> 1:07:59.336
I do cherish my traditions.

1:07:59.510 --> 1:08:02.861
I would have quit drinking
after Beatrice and I were married.

1:08:03.035 --> 1:08:05.820
You do not think
I knew of your plans

1:08:05.994 --> 1:08:08.867
to convert this house
to a summer stock theater?

1:08:09.563 --> 1:08:11.913
I may be consigned
to the netherworld,

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:15.178
but even I have my limits.

1:08:15.352 --> 1:08:16.962
No one wants you here.

1:08:17.136 --> 1:08:18.268
Go away!

1:08:18.442 --> 1:08:19.965
Silly child.

1:08:20.139 --> 1:08:23.795
The only desires that matter
are my own.

1:08:23.969 --> 1:08:26.450
All I want is some white-out.

1:08:26.928 --> 1:08:30.715
- What's that?
- Jack hates that he's missing the party.

1:08:31.368 --> 1:08:32.760
Leave Jack out of this.

1:08:33.239 --> 1:08:35.415
But I've always accommodated

1:08:35.589 --> 1:08:39.289
the wishes
of the Auldcraft family.

1:08:41.334 --> 1:08:42.335
Seymour,

1:08:43.075 --> 1:08:45.599
now might be a good time
to have a trick up his sleeve.

1:08:53.259 --> 1:08:54.782
You okay?

1:08:57.698 --> 1:08:58.698
The sigil is right.

1:09:00.005 --> 1:09:01.137
It's gaining power.

1:09:02.442 --> 1:09:03.443
Well...

1:09:03.922 --> 1:09:06.011
Okay, everyone,

1:09:06.446 --> 1:09:08.883
take a minute
to catch your lack of breath.

1:09:10.581 --> 1:09:11.712
Julia,

1:09:12.626 --> 1:09:14.454
the sigil spoke to you
before this?

1:09:15.455 --> 1:09:17.283
Spoke to me the night I died.

1:09:18.241 --> 1:09:20.547
That awful, haunting voice.

1:09:21.244 --> 1:09:24.986
It sounded like Richard, but
somehow I knew it wasn't him.

1:09:26.162 --> 1:09:28.990
So it was the sigil that
lured you into the cemetery?

1:09:31.341 --> 1:09:33.038
- Yes.
- Man.

1:09:33.647 --> 1:09:36.650
That sigil loves killing people
more than bad movie directors.

1:09:37.216 --> 1:09:40.350
But why? Why would the sigil
want me dead?

1:09:40.915 --> 1:09:44.005
Because you were going
to take Seymour away.

1:09:44.789 --> 1:09:49.359
And it's difficult for a piece of
paper to file for visitation rights.

1:09:51.056 --> 1:09:54.015
It wants me to be the human
receptacle for Jack the Ripper.

1:09:56.279 --> 1:09:59.151
Now that Richard's gone,
it's got more power.

1:10:01.806 --> 1:10:03.721
It's going to force me
to channel Jack.

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:08.116
It's going to turn you
into an army of ghosts.

1:10:09.117 --> 1:10:11.163
So we're not only drafts,
we'll be drafted.

1:10:11.337 --> 1:10:13.687
This night can start
getting better anytime now.

1:10:13.861 --> 1:10:14.688
What can we do?

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:17.822
Since Richard's not here,

1:10:17.996 --> 1:10:18.996
there's no way for me

1:10:19.084 --> 1:10:20.390
to get rid of it on my own.

1:10:21.478 --> 1:10:22.478
We have to get him back,

1:10:22.870 --> 1:10:24.307
whatever the cost.

1:10:25.046 --> 1:10:26.966
You're not going
to try to create the door again.

1:10:27.353 --> 1:10:30.748
Remember what happened to
Victoria when she tried to open it?

1:10:31.488 --> 1:10:32.488
I have to.

1:10:33.838 --> 1:10:34.882
I'll force the door open.

1:10:36.014 --> 1:10:37.581
No one will have
to touch it this time.

1:10:37.755 --> 1:10:40.061
But what will you do
if Jack tries to step through?

1:10:42.150 --> 1:10:43.717
I'll slam the door in his face.

1:10:44.370 --> 1:10:47.765
Great. So everything depends
on metaphysical rules of etiquette.

1:10:49.767 --> 1:10:50.767
Lily...

1:10:51.943 --> 1:10:53.292
it's time for you to leave.

1:10:54.119 --> 1:10:56.774
Not the type of door you need
to be showing me, Seymour.

1:10:56.948 --> 1:10:58.515
But this isn't up
for discussion.

1:10:59.864 --> 1:11:02.388
So you need my help
to channel ghosts,

1:11:02.562 --> 1:11:04.434
but forcing them back
to the land of the living

1:11:04.608 --> 1:11:06.871
- is solo time?
- Yeah.

1:11:07.698 --> 1:11:10.178
So I'm just trying
to follow your logic here.

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:12.485
Apparently,
the more circles we cross,

1:11:12.659 --> 1:11:14.270
the more you want
to be ringleader.

1:11:15.749 --> 1:11:18.186
My logic is to see you
out of this place.

1:11:18.796 --> 1:11:20.667
It's too dangerous.
It's getting risky.

1:11:21.581 --> 1:11:23.975
Which we'll face together,
like we always have.

1:11:25.019 --> 1:11:27.283
If we can face
the Loch Ness monster together,

1:11:27.457 --> 1:11:28.936
we can face this.

1:11:29.110 --> 1:11:31.678
Lily, that was a branch
floating in the water.

1:11:31.852 --> 1:11:33.289
It was a very scary branch.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:37.989
This is different.
And you're right.

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:41.253
It is solo time.

1:11:43.647 --> 1:11:46.127
Hey, this is
super unnatural cheating.

1:11:47.128 --> 1:11:48.128
Guys...

1:11:50.828 --> 1:11:51.828
Oh.

1:11:53.439 --> 1:11:56.094
Seymour? Hey, let me in.

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:02.535
- Wow.
- Sweetie, your power is incredible.

1:12:02.709 --> 1:12:04.624
I did grow up around ghosts.

1:12:04.798 --> 1:12:08.802
But all we can do is float books
and flicker lights.

1:12:08.976 --> 1:12:12.110
Yeah, my bar tricks were
a lot better when I was alive.

1:12:12.284 --> 1:12:13.284
But this,

1:12:14.025 --> 1:12:16.984
this is one of a kind special.

1:12:18.290 --> 1:12:19.378
One of a kind special.

1:12:20.684 --> 1:12:21.685
Then you knew.

1:12:22.990 --> 1:12:23.990
Of course I knew.

1:12:24.427 --> 1:12:26.080
I had to keep
my abilities secret.

1:12:26.994 --> 1:12:29.432
I, I couldn't risk being used
as an experiment.

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:31.129
Or, or a weapon.

1:12:32.522 --> 1:12:35.327
- I had to keep them secret from my friends, from my...
- Let me in.

1:12:35.351 --> 1:12:38.223
Hey. Hello. I know
you can hear me. I'm so mad.

1:12:38.397 --> 1:12:40.399
From reality television
producers.

1:12:40.921 --> 1:12:43.184
But now Lily knows.

1:12:44.751 --> 1:12:46.100
And accepts you.

1:12:47.275 --> 1:12:48.451
She's an amazing girl.

1:12:49.103 --> 1:12:51.236
Are you trying
to make me feel worse?

1:12:51.410 --> 1:12:53.543
- No.
- Let's get on with it.

1:12:54.239 --> 1:12:56.079
- All right...
- I'm starting to lose my nerve.

1:12:56.546 --> 1:12:57.546
Go then.

1:12:58.635 --> 1:12:59.853
Everyone, get ready.

1:13:09.820 --> 1:13:11.082
Almost there.

1:13:13.606 --> 1:13:14.651
Seymour.

1:13:15.478 --> 1:13:17.697
Hurry. Jack is coming.

1:13:18.263 --> 1:13:20.265
Richard, step through.

1:13:21.048 --> 1:13:25.270
- Victoria!
- Head toward the light, or the.

1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:27.925
Nothing's happening.

1:13:28.447 --> 1:13:31.581
I'm coming.

1:13:32.059 --> 1:13:33.365
Toward the light.

1:13:33.539 --> 1:13:35.236
I, I thought you wanted
to annoy Seymour,

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:37.108
so I brought up women's rights.

1:13:37.282 --> 1:13:39.415
Don't you hear them?
They're calling us.

1:13:40.024 --> 1:13:44.942
Sorry, does this have anything to
do with that upstart Alexander Bell?

1:13:45.638 --> 1:13:47.988
No, they want us
to come through.

1:13:50.774 --> 1:13:53.167
Honestly, Richard,
in over 200 years,

1:13:53.341 --> 1:13:55.300
did you never learn to RSVP?

1:13:55.474 --> 1:13:57.911
Oh, oh. He's behind us.

1:13:58.956 --> 1:14:00.566
Seymour.

1:14:00.740 --> 1:14:03.787
Here's Jack!

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.354
What is this?

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:09.357
You're behind bars,
where you belong.

1:14:09.532 --> 1:14:11.664
These bars won't hold me.

1:14:12.709 --> 1:14:16.843
- Well, I will.
- The sigil wants me in complete control.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:21.979
Did you really think Richard
was afforded this opportunity

1:14:22.153 --> 1:14:24.198
because of his
charming personality?

1:14:24.372 --> 1:14:25.852
It is rather charming.

1:14:26.374 --> 1:14:30.074
The fallen knew
you would rise one day.

1:14:30.683 --> 1:14:33.077
Why would the fallen care?
They can't even get up.

1:14:33.251 --> 1:14:36.080
A boy with incredible power,

1:14:36.559 --> 1:14:40.432
a man who could shape
the destiny of the entire world.

1:14:40.606 --> 1:14:41.607
You're wrong.

1:14:42.086 --> 1:14:43.479
When I have your power,

1:14:44.262 --> 1:14:46.133
everyone will bleed!

1:14:46.307 --> 1:14:47.700
You monster.

1:14:47.874 --> 1:14:50.137
That's why I was stabbed
with a knife.

1:14:50.311 --> 1:14:51.356
That's why I died.

1:14:55.186 --> 1:14:56.186
Seymour!

1:14:56.796 --> 1:14:59.059
My spirit,
so we could be united,

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:01.453
and Richard won't ruin it
this time.

1:15:01.627 --> 1:15:03.890
I never ruin anything.

1:15:04.064 --> 1:15:06.023
That's a good thing.

1:15:06.197 --> 1:15:07.198
Idiots.

1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:10.941
Honestly, I have no idea
what's going on.

1:15:11.115 --> 1:15:14.988
Your name will be written
on the sigil at last.

1:15:18.818 --> 1:15:19.906
No.

1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:22.474
- Lily!
- Hold this.

1:15:27.827 --> 1:15:28.827
Ow.

1:15:29.742 --> 1:15:31.352
How did you get back in?

1:15:31.527 --> 1:15:32.832
Uh, the front door was open,

1:15:33.703 --> 1:15:34.834
I walked right through.

1:15:35.008 --> 1:15:36.314
You're kidding me!

1:15:37.228 --> 1:15:40.448
What? Ghosts are
a great security system.

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:43.539
I'm going to kill you again.

1:15:43.713 --> 1:15:45.453
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:15:45.845 --> 1:15:48.587
The next time my nephew attempts
to find Jack the Ripper

1:15:48.761 --> 1:15:51.329
to his hell cloud,
without using his girlfriend,

1:15:51.503 --> 1:15:53.287
I'll remember
to lock the freaking door.

1:15:53.461 --> 1:15:56.377
You may remove yourself
from me, Victoria.

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:59.990
Honestly, Richard,
you have the gratitude of a cat.

1:16:02.514 --> 1:16:03.514
Are you okay?

1:16:04.124 --> 1:16:05.256
I'm okay, but I'm drained.

1:16:06.344 --> 1:16:08.346
We're here. Oh.

1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:10.478
And it's so wonderful
to see everyone.

1:16:10.870 --> 1:16:12.306
Well, welcome back to the party.

1:16:12.829 --> 1:16:14.178
How was, uh, limbo?

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:17.398
Oh, interminable. It was
like calling for the butler,

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:20.140
- and he would never come.
- Speak for yourself.

1:16:20.314 --> 1:16:22.273
The butler responded
immediately.

1:16:22.447 --> 1:16:25.232
Lily, are you okay?

1:16:25.711 --> 1:16:27.017
I feel funny.

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:29.019
What did you do to her?

1:16:29.193 --> 1:16:30.977
There are consequences

1:16:31.151 --> 1:16:32.675
to disobedience.

1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:35.765
If she's into
that sort of thing.

1:16:35.939 --> 1:16:38.463
Are we addressing
a piece of paper?

1:16:38.942 --> 1:16:40.813
I inscribed a new name.

1:16:41.292 --> 1:16:43.816
Perhaps not the one
I originally intended,

1:16:43.990 --> 1:16:46.776
but one I quite like.

1:16:46.950 --> 1:16:48.125
"Lily Herdston."

1:16:49.517 --> 1:16:51.258
It says, "Lily Herdston."

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:52.999
That's me.

1:16:53.478 --> 1:16:55.480
Funny thing about doors.

1:16:55.872 --> 1:16:58.048
You can walk through
either side.

1:17:00.877 --> 1:17:02.269
- No.
- No! Seymour, no.

1:17:02.443 --> 1:17:03.923
Remember what happened to me?

1:17:05.882 --> 1:17:07.144
I kept her safe!

1:17:08.145 --> 1:17:09.842
I kept her away from you!

1:17:10.016 --> 1:17:11.801
Mortals!

1:17:12.584 --> 1:17:14.760
Is that how my voice sounds?

1:17:15.369 --> 1:17:17.502
It's been a long night.

1:17:18.721 --> 1:17:21.071
Is that the real reason
why you didn't want to marry me?

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:25.747
Well, this has nothing to do

1:17:25.771 --> 1:17:27.773
with you being a modern man

1:17:27.947 --> 1:17:29.862
who needs his space. You just,

1:17:30.036 --> 1:17:32.386
you wanted to protect me
from being cursed?

1:17:33.474 --> 1:17:36.173
He wanted to protect me
from the bridal registry.

1:17:36.695 --> 1:17:39.872
I hate paying for wrapping paper
and silver ribbon.

1:17:40.046 --> 1:17:42.092
- Gerald.
- What?

1:17:43.310 --> 1:17:44.834
Dead fiancé card.

1:17:47.488 --> 1:17:49.577
I couldn't risk you
for anything.

1:17:49.752 --> 1:17:51.754
I, I got...

1:17:52.624 --> 1:17:53.712
You wanted to marry me?

1:17:56.149 --> 1:17:57.749
I wanted to marry you
more than anything.

1:17:59.065 --> 1:18:01.546
Seymour, you're an idiot.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:03.809
I can deal with any curse
if I were with you.

1:18:04.288 --> 1:18:05.724
Don't you know me at all?

1:18:05.898 --> 1:18:08.379
I'm Seymour
"the Seer's" assistant,

1:18:08.727 --> 1:18:12.426
and together, we do
the impossible before breakfast.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:13.600
Breakfast?

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:16.256
Are we having breakfast already?

1:18:18.084 --> 1:18:19.869
- What?
- Richard.

1:18:21.871 --> 1:18:24.090
You need to tell me
how to enter names in the sigil.

1:18:24.874 --> 1:18:26.658
Now, why would I do that?

1:18:26.832 --> 1:18:29.269
- To save us.
- Julia?

1:18:29.792 --> 1:18:32.533
Is this another one
of your feminine causes?

1:18:33.143 --> 1:18:35.362
To get her name off of it.
That's why.

1:18:35.885 --> 1:18:37.930
Well, I'm afraid
that's impossible.

1:18:38.104 --> 1:18:41.629
Once a name is added to the
sigil, it's written indelibly.

1:18:41.804 --> 1:18:44.937
I do have the power to banish
a spirit to the ether,

1:18:45.111 --> 1:18:48.549
but even then, the...
The, the ink, it only fades.

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:50.179
It does not disappear.

1:18:54.033 --> 1:18:56.079
Best thing I ever did
was sign that contract,

1:18:56.253 --> 1:18:58.081
even better
than whale oil.

1:18:58.255 --> 1:19:00.276
Well, it's time to
revoke the contract right now.

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:01.824
No more excuses.

1:19:01.998 --> 1:19:04.478
You would have me
return my gift to the family.

1:19:04.957 --> 1:19:06.524
Size didn't fit, Richard.

1:19:08.004 --> 1:19:11.442
I, I need to consider the
ramifications of such a decision.

1:19:11.921 --> 1:19:14.880
We need to recreate the ceremony
so I can reverse it.

1:19:15.054 --> 1:19:16.403
Aren't we being hasty?

1:19:16.577 --> 1:19:18.884
Perhaps the sigil can be
reasoned with.

1:19:19.058 --> 1:19:20.146
Reasoned with?

1:19:20.843 --> 1:19:22.932
That thing's worse than
a time-share run by the UN.

1:19:23.106 --> 1:19:25.586
It was only acting
in self-defense.

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:27.763
Self-defense? It wrote her name.

1:19:27.937 --> 1:19:30.940
Perhaps it wishes to give her
the same blessing as well.

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:32.855
May I weigh in?

1:19:33.029 --> 1:19:34.160
No.

1:19:34.334 --> 1:19:35.858
Huh, I could never deny

1:19:36.032 --> 1:19:37.685
that incredible voice.

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:40.776
Richard, think of the future,

1:19:40.950 --> 1:19:41.951
and your legacy.

1:19:42.125 --> 1:19:44.127
The entire world

1:19:44.301 --> 1:19:47.478
will know the name Auldcraft.

1:19:48.044 --> 1:19:50.046
The entire world.

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:53.484
Your portrait will
be on everyone's mantel.

1:19:53.658 --> 1:19:56.617
Uh, I'd rather have it
on the money.

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:59.838
Richard, don't listen
to that thing.

1:20:00.012 --> 1:20:02.972
But my ambition
is the best part of me.

1:20:03.146 --> 1:20:05.670
No, the best part of you
is your heart.

1:20:06.062 --> 1:20:07.585
Hear and obey me.

1:20:07.759 --> 1:20:10.675
Your name will live forever.

1:20:11.328 --> 1:20:13.286
You wished to bless this family

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:15.569
because you wanted to be remembered.

1:20:15.593 --> 1:20:19.075
And I have been
thanks to the sigil.

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:22.165
My entire life has been devoted

1:20:22.339 --> 1:20:26.299
- to the needs of this family and preserving its memories.
- I know.

1:20:27.039 --> 1:20:29.825
I can barely remember
the name I was born with.

1:20:30.434 --> 1:20:32.566
The years do pile on,
don't they?

1:20:33.567 --> 1:20:37.006
I became an Auldcraft
when I married your grandson.

1:20:37.180 --> 1:20:38.572
Which was wonderful.

1:20:39.051 --> 1:20:42.315
Make me proud of that name,
Richard, like you always do.

1:20:42.707 --> 1:20:46.145
Victoria, I just can't do it.

1:20:46.319 --> 1:20:47.625
Not even for you.

1:20:48.365 --> 1:20:49.801
Well, here we are.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:51.934
The final choice.

1:20:52.543 --> 1:20:54.937
Are you motivated by love
or by the past?

1:20:55.111 --> 1:20:56.721
You must choose at last.

1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:00.116
I have so much
more to give you, Richard.

1:21:00.594 --> 1:21:03.467
This house, the family party,

1:21:03.641 --> 1:21:08.167
Mary, an amuse bouche
before every feast.

1:21:08.341 --> 1:21:11.910
And yes, your picture
can be on the money.

1:21:12.432 --> 1:21:15.261
Choose now, and forever.

1:21:18.525 --> 1:21:20.266
Seymour, huh.

1:21:20.832 --> 1:21:22.181
We're going to need a bell.

1:21:22.355 --> 1:21:23.182
I started the ritual

1:21:23.356 --> 1:21:24.444
by ringing a bell

1:21:24.618 --> 1:21:25.793
to toll for the dead.

1:21:26.185 --> 1:21:27.795
I, I've got an app for that.

1:21:27.970 --> 1:21:30.010
That won't work with
the Spirit World. It's digital.

1:21:30.102 --> 1:21:32.235
Jeez, get with the times,
Spirit World.

1:21:32.670 --> 1:21:34.672
I have a bell.

1:21:34.846 --> 1:21:36.021
Perfect.

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:38.981
Then I snuffed a candle.

1:21:39.155 --> 1:21:40.852
Gee, what did the candle
ever do to you?

1:21:41.026 --> 1:21:42.026
Done.

1:21:42.462 --> 1:21:44.595
And then I signed my name

1:21:44.769 --> 1:21:46.162
in a book and I closed it.

1:21:46.336 --> 1:21:48.555
Which book?

1:21:48.729 --> 1:21:49.729
It's Jack.

1:21:49.861 --> 1:21:50.981
We don't have a lot of time.

1:21:52.255 --> 1:21:53.691
I don't remember. Uh...

1:21:53.865 --> 1:21:55.625
It, it, it was the one
about the family history,

1:21:55.649 --> 1:21:56.912
the Auldcraft family history,

1:21:57.086 --> 1:21:59.349
um, of births,
uh, deaths, marriages.

1:21:59.523 --> 1:22:00.935
It has
to be here somewhere.

1:22:00.959 --> 1:22:02.265
Start with the As.

1:22:02.787 --> 1:22:03.614
Take your time.

1:22:03.788 --> 1:22:05.398
Let's have some tea.

1:22:05.572 --> 1:22:06.965
Don't mock tea.

1:22:07.139 --> 1:22:08.967
Births, death, marriages?

1:22:09.141 --> 1:22:10.360
I know the book.

1:22:11.317 --> 1:22:13.276
Richard, I still
don't understand

1:22:13.450 --> 1:22:15.626
why you refused to record
Seymour's birth.

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:17.410
Seymour, uh...

1:22:17.933 --> 1:22:21.414
The... The other side
of the blanket and all that.

1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:24.200
I was never able to write
your name in it, Seymour.

1:22:24.635 --> 1:22:26.419
That's why your name
isn't on the sigil.

1:22:26.767 --> 1:22:27.768
Lucky for us.

1:22:28.247 --> 1:22:30.380
'Cause this night
is going so well.

1:22:30.989 --> 1:22:34.427
So to reverse the ritual,
you'd have to light the candle,

1:22:34.601 --> 1:22:36.038
open the book and ring a bell.

1:22:36.212 --> 1:22:37.648
To toll for the dead.

1:22:41.739 --> 1:22:43.697
No, that's not all.

1:22:43.871 --> 1:22:45.569
There has to be
a binding phrase.

1:22:45.743 --> 1:22:48.920
Um, how about, "'Round
the fang, through the gums,

1:22:49.094 --> 1:22:51.314
- look out Heaven, here he comes"?
- Richard.

1:22:51.879 --> 1:22:53.838
What did you say
at the end of the ritual?

1:22:54.012 --> 1:22:56.012
Uh, it's, it's, it's,
it's on the tip of my tongue.

1:23:00.149 --> 1:23:02.064
Say the binding phrase, Richard.

1:23:02.238 --> 1:23:03.761
Don't rush me.

1:23:03.935 --> 1:23:05.893
I said it's
on the tip of my tongue.

1:23:08.070 --> 1:23:09.680
We really should make haste.

1:23:09.854 --> 1:23:13.031
Oh, oh, oh.
I have it, I have it.

1:23:13.205 --> 1:23:16.339
All right. Then it's time
for one last family activity.

1:23:16.513 --> 1:23:18.254
Say the binding phrase, Richard.

1:23:18.428 --> 1:23:19.559
Here it goes.

1:23:20.908 --> 1:23:23.215
To lift the sigil from the land,

1:23:23.389 --> 1:23:26.392
use ghostly prayer
in unwrit hand.

1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:30.570
Uh, the bad portrait didn't give
you a tip off that it was a demon?

1:23:30.744 --> 1:23:33.095
Well, I was excited about
the thought of immortality.

1:23:33.269 --> 1:23:35.184
I didn't judge the syntax.

1:23:35.358 --> 1:23:37.795
How can you have
unwritten handwriting?

1:23:37.969 --> 1:23:41.407
It's just paranormal prittle-prattle.
It doesn't mean anything.

1:23:41.581 --> 1:23:43.627
Is that your opinion,
or the angel with scales?

1:23:43.801 --> 1:23:46.238
Both of ours. We were trying
to end the ceremony early.

1:23:46.412 --> 1:23:47.848
We had previous engagements.

1:23:48.023 --> 1:23:50.590
Oh, Richard,
you are truly one of a kind.

1:23:50.764 --> 1:23:52.244
Oh, thank you.

1:23:52.766 --> 1:23:55.030
All right.
Say the words, Richard.

1:23:55.204 --> 1:23:56.988
All right, don't shout.

1:23:57.989 --> 1:24:00.774
The dead shall stay
to the end of time.

1:24:01.123 --> 1:24:04.126
The fallen shall rise at the,
the final time...

1:24:04.691 --> 1:24:06.824
What does it mean?

1:24:10.088 --> 1:24:13.178
It means that if we don't destroy
this thing by the end of midnight,

1:24:13.352 --> 1:24:15.180
we're screwed.

1:24:21.317 --> 1:24:23.275
Lily, I need you by my side.

1:24:23.449 --> 1:24:24.668
You don't have to say that

1:24:24.842 --> 1:24:26.148
'cause that's
where I already am.

1:24:27.410 --> 1:24:28.802
I have to light the candle.

1:24:36.288 --> 1:24:37.985
It's resisting!

1:24:38.986 --> 1:24:40.553
Not enough magic bubble bath.

1:24:40.727 --> 1:24:41.728
Let me try.

1:24:42.381 --> 1:24:46.168
Lily. No, it's,
it's too powerful.

1:24:46.342 --> 1:24:48.126
Auldcrafts!

1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:49.475
Are you okay?

1:24:51.086 --> 1:24:52.130
On my signal.

1:24:52.826 --> 1:24:56.700
One, two, three!

1:24:58.180 --> 1:24:59.300
We're almost there.

1:25:01.052 --> 1:25:02.292
Yeah, we have to open the book.

1:25:07.189 --> 1:25:08.364
I'm not strong enough.

1:25:09.539 --> 1:25:12.933
There's ghostly prayer in unwrit
hand, "Seymour" name is unwritten,

1:25:13.108 --> 1:25:14.413
and I'm a ghost.

1:25:14.979 --> 1:25:17.721
Together. Seymour,
we must open the book together.

1:25:21.638 --> 1:25:22.943
Hey, it's almost midnight.

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:24.249
Victoria, ring the bell.

1:25:25.772 --> 1:25:26.772
No!

1:25:27.992 --> 1:25:30.037
- We're doomed.
- We're out of time.

1:25:30.212 --> 1:25:33.737
The fallen will
rise at the final charge.

1:25:33.911 --> 1:25:35.608
Oh, no. No.

1:25:35.782 --> 1:25:38.220
The fallen will rise.

1:25:38.394 --> 1:25:40.309
The fallen, arise!

1:25:40.483 --> 1:25:44.704
Auldcraft, beware my wrath!

1:25:44.878 --> 1:25:47.118
This thing doesn't want to
hand out trick-or-treat candy.

1:25:47.577 --> 1:25:48.795
Seymour.

1:25:50.014 --> 1:25:51.189
Seymour!

1:25:52.625 --> 1:25:54.149
It's absorbing my power.

1:25:55.237 --> 1:25:57.413
Of course,

1:25:57.587 --> 1:25:59.547
church bells ring
at midnight on All Hallows' Eve.

1:25:59.719 --> 1:26:01.199
To toll for the dead!

1:26:01.373 --> 1:26:02.461
Now, Richard!

1:26:03.332 --> 1:26:06.683
I am revoking the contract!

1:26:18.434 --> 1:26:19.826
Can I open my eyes now?

1:26:20.305 --> 1:26:21.393
Is this over?

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.360
One last throat
for old time's sake.

1:26:32.361 --> 1:26:33.840
- Hey, Jack.
- What?

1:26:34.363 --> 1:26:35.538
Go to hell.

1:26:37.583 --> 1:26:39.759
The sigil and me had a deal.

1:26:39.933 --> 1:26:41.370
A deal!

1:26:41.935 --> 1:26:44.590
Now is it truly over?

1:26:44.764 --> 1:26:47.071
Uh, yes.

1:26:47.941 --> 1:26:49.769
Jack is gone.

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:52.163
The sigil is destroyed.

1:26:52.859 --> 1:26:55.297
And we aren't bound
to this plane any longer.

1:26:55.819 --> 1:26:59.692
Then, now boarding to...

1:27:02.391 --> 1:27:04.480
- Oh!
- What is that?

1:27:04.654 --> 1:27:05.655
Oh!

1:27:06.264 --> 1:27:07.918
It's warmth!

1:27:08.527 --> 1:27:12.618
I... I had
forgotten what warmth felt like.

1:27:12.792 --> 1:27:15.273
That, my dears,
is the other side.

1:27:16.274 --> 1:27:19.234
I shall retreat. The family
will need a head count.

1:27:20.670 --> 1:27:21.670
Um...

1:27:22.759 --> 1:27:24.326
They don't all have heads.

1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:25.718
Oh, Richard.

1:27:26.589 --> 1:27:27.851
Allow me.

1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:31.202
Everyone,

1:27:31.985 --> 1:27:35.293
please adjourn to the cemetery.

1:27:36.033 --> 1:27:39.254
This year
the party continues upstairs.

1:27:40.951 --> 1:27:41.951
Oh.

1:27:44.346 --> 1:27:47.000
Lily, I'm pleased
to introduce you

1:27:47.174 --> 1:27:50.352
to over 200 years of Auldcrafts.

1:27:51.266 --> 1:27:53.093
- Oh.
- Bye, Mom.

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:54.878
Dad, see you in a minute.

1:27:55.052 --> 1:27:56.052
Whoa!

1:27:56.923 --> 1:27:58.363
Everyone...

1:27:58.534 --> 1:27:59.970
Attention on me, please.

1:28:00.536 --> 1:28:03.103
Yes, Richard.

1:28:03.278 --> 1:28:06.063
Tonight was an extraordinary night.

1:28:06.759 --> 1:28:08.848
And I confess that I see things

1:28:09.022 --> 1:28:11.590
in a different light,
literally.

1:28:11.764 --> 1:28:17.335
And...
I apologize

1:28:17.857 --> 1:28:22.906
if my actions were
a little less than convenient.

1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:24.603
Less than?

1:28:25.169 --> 1:28:26.692
- Look...
- Apology accepted.

1:28:27.867 --> 1:28:29.391
And thank you
for making it, Richard.

1:28:30.261 --> 1:28:31.261
Seymour.

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:35.397
I'm sorry. I... I misjudged you.

1:28:36.528 --> 1:28:37.528
That's fine.

1:28:38.051 --> 1:28:40.010
We're in different generations,

1:28:40.184 --> 1:28:43.579
- like 200 years or so.
- All right.

1:28:44.797 --> 1:28:45.842
You're forgiven.

1:28:46.016 --> 1:28:47.887
I guess we all signed contracts

1:28:48.061 --> 1:28:50.716
without seeing the devil in
the details every now and then.

1:28:52.196 --> 1:28:53.719
I suppose I should follow them.

1:28:54.851 --> 1:28:58.855
You know, I shouldn't think
that paradise should compare to

1:28:59.725 --> 1:29:00.725
all this.

1:29:01.684 --> 1:29:03.729
Richard, if the worst
you have to worry about

1:29:03.903 --> 1:29:05.383
is lack of control,

1:29:05.557 --> 1:29:09.300
it will be a very nice
afterlife, after all.

1:29:10.083 --> 1:29:11.346
Indeed.

1:29:12.042 --> 1:29:14.305
Well, I... I should hurry up.

1:29:15.262 --> 1:29:18.744
Humility is not
my finest quality.

1:29:21.051 --> 1:29:22.444
I shall be next.

1:29:22.618 --> 1:29:23.618
Seymour,

1:29:24.184 --> 1:29:26.317
you make me proud
to be an Auldcraft.

1:29:27.057 --> 1:29:28.057
Thank you.

1:29:28.754 --> 1:29:31.148
Oh, I have a superior
final thought this time.

1:29:32.105 --> 1:29:35.979
It's all right to be sentimental
as long as you are in love.

1:29:37.807 --> 1:29:39.635
Bye, Victoria...

1:29:39.809 --> 1:29:40.809
I'll miss you.

1:29:41.767 --> 1:29:42.942
Remember us, Seymour.

1:29:44.204 --> 1:29:47.643
I hope that whatever's beyond
the great beyond,

1:29:48.339 --> 1:29:49.819
there's a lovely cup of tea.

1:29:52.648 --> 1:29:53.823
My turn.

1:29:55.041 --> 1:29:56.041
Mom.

1:29:56.826 --> 1:29:58.305
You don't have to say anything.

1:29:59.002 --> 1:30:02.005
You're a wonderful son,
and you've made me very proud.

1:30:04.050 --> 1:30:05.878
But if you don't marry
that girl,

1:30:06.052 --> 1:30:07.793
I promise I will find a way
to haunt you.

1:30:08.577 --> 1:30:09.752
Yeah.

1:30:10.405 --> 1:30:13.277
My love to both of you,
depend on it.

1:30:14.234 --> 1:30:15.234
Love you too, Mom.

1:30:22.808 --> 1:30:23.808
My turn.

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:29.946
Oh.

1:30:30.860 --> 1:30:31.860
Right.

1:30:32.209 --> 1:30:33.515
Drink in front of me.

1:30:33.689 --> 1:30:36.169
That'll make me feel better.

1:30:36.735 --> 1:30:38.041
Just hang in there, Gerald.

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:46.440
What?

1:30:47.703 --> 1:30:48.983
That's impossible,
you know that.

1:30:49.095 --> 1:30:50.488
Take it. Come on, try.

1:30:56.276 --> 1:30:57.276
Hey, look at that.

1:30:57.408 --> 1:30:59.062
Seymour, how'd you do that?

1:31:01.107 --> 1:31:04.676
I am amazing.

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:11.596
Well, are you going to drink?

1:31:13.163 --> 1:31:14.686
You don't have to tell me twice.

1:31:21.563 --> 1:31:22.912
To the Auldcraft family.

1:31:26.393 --> 1:31:29.614
I believe I...
speak for everyone

1:31:30.267 --> 1:31:31.442
when I say...

1:31:33.226 --> 1:31:34.489
what the hell was that?

1:31:40.669 --> 1:31:42.105
Oh, wow.

1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:45.587
Oh, twice as smooth
when you're dead.

1:31:47.806 --> 1:31:48.806
Nephew...

1:31:50.983 --> 1:31:53.769
you are, without a doubt,

1:31:54.247 --> 1:31:57.599
the best bartender ever.

1:31:58.382 --> 1:32:00.689
Ready for the golden light now?

1:32:01.037 --> 1:32:03.518
All right, all right. Um...

1:32:05.215 --> 1:32:06.999
I am a one for the road
kind of guy.

1:32:07.173 --> 1:32:08.871
It's going to be a long...

1:32:09.045 --> 1:32:10.307
Gerald.

1:32:12.962 --> 1:32:14.050
Oh, I love you two.

1:32:16.531 --> 1:32:18.707
And I better
not see you again

1:32:18.881 --> 1:32:21.710
for a long, long time.

1:32:28.412 --> 1:32:29.544
But when we do...

1:32:31.110 --> 1:32:34.984
it's going to be
one heck of a happy hour.

1:32:41.294 --> 1:32:42.294
They're all gone.

1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:45.080
All gone.

1:32:46.952 --> 1:32:47.997
Are you sure?

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:50.880
I mean, I'm sure.

1:32:52.305 --> 1:32:55.744
Well, the house
doesn't seem so scary now

1:32:55.918 --> 1:32:59.051
- without these vortexes of doom.
- You bet.

1:32:59.530 --> 1:33:01.271
It hasn't been this empty in

1:33:02.054 --> 1:33:03.578
over 200 years.

1:33:04.143 --> 1:33:06.058
It's kind of boring.

1:33:06.232 --> 1:33:07.862
Come on, we could use
a lifetime of boring

1:33:07.886 --> 1:33:09.845
- at this point.
- Point.

1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:13.675
So, what are we
going to do with this mansion?

1:33:14.763 --> 1:33:17.026
Well, look at the place.

1:33:18.375 --> 1:33:19.695
Obviously, we're going
to keep it.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.947
Kind of a perfect place
to have my wedding.

1:33:26.078 --> 1:33:29.125
Seymour Edwin Auldcraft,

1:33:29.734 --> 1:33:32.171
are you finally proposing to me?

1:33:32.868 --> 1:33:36.436
I mean, somebody
has to keep the lineage going.

1:33:37.133 --> 1:33:39.222
I mean, this place
just screams...

1:33:39.962 --> 1:33:40.962
Family!

1:33:45.141 --> 1:33:47.012
We have a lot of planning to do.

1:33:47.186 --> 1:33:49.406
There is definitely
an app for that.

1:34:20.437 --> 1:34:23.092
Auldcrafts, rest in peace.
