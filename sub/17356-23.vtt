WEBVTT

00:06.874 --> 00:09.041
- Ha, Phoebs, did you see
how I stopped

00:09.043 --> 00:10.142
that runaway refrigerator?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.477
- It was on wheels
and way lighter

00:11.479 --> 00:14.213
than the piano I stopped,
but great job.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.415
Not bad for morning saves.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.118
- Wait! Phoebe, it's dinnertime.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.154
- Max, for the last time, you
have to look at the little hand,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.390
not the--oh my gosh,
it's dinnertime!

00:25.226 --> 00:28.060
I had so much stuff
I was supposed to do today.

00:28.062 --> 00:28.594
- Me, too.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.661
- I have
a history project to do.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.231
And I have to find an outfit
for the spring fling dance.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.500
And I have got to sew
a pocket into my cape,

00:34.502 --> 00:36.468
because this isn't working out.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.270
- Ever since we
stepped up our game to impress

00:38.272 --> 00:40.572
the Z Force, there's just not
enough time to do everything.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.941
- I know, I still have to--
- Quiet, Phoebe,

00:42.943 --> 00:45.044
no one likes a complainer.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.213
- Hey, kids, how are you?
- Hungry.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.082
- Hello, sandwiches.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.321
- Get your fingers
off the finger foods!

00:56.323 --> 00:57.689
- Ow!

01:00.027 --> 01:01.493
- What's with
Sergeant Slap Hands?

01:01.495 --> 01:04.096
- This was our old sidekick,
Assista Boy.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.066
- We told you tons of stories
about him.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.700
- Oh, this is gonna be awkward,

01:08.702 --> 01:11.303
but we never
listen to your stories.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.306
- He's currently between heroes,
and came by to say hello.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.108
- Well, actually,
Electra's called me

01:16.110 --> 01:17.409
to snake out the toilet.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.412
I haven't taken care
of a Thunder clog in years.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.549
- You work miracles.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.484
- Golly gee, Thunder Twins,

01:25.486 --> 01:27.252
I hear that you two
are Z Force contenders.

01:27.254 --> 01:31.390
I bet you're gonna be great
heroes just like your parents.

01:32.326 --> 01:36.261
- Not today, pickle.
- Oh.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.630
How do I function without you?

01:38.632 --> 01:39.198
[laughs]

01:39.200 --> 01:41.333
- The only reason we were able
to save the world

01:41.335 --> 01:43.368
is because you took care
of everything else.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.271
- Yeah, he filed our paperwork,
cleaned our super suits.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.674
He even trimmed
your dad's nose hairs.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.675
- Mm-hmm.

01:49.677 --> 01:53.212
- Speaking of which,
lot of hay in the barn.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.013
- Oh.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.483
- I exist...to assist!

02:00.321 --> 02:03.322
- [motor running]

02:03.324 --> 02:04.690
- Whooo!
- [sniffs]

02:04.692 --> 02:06.625
I can breathe again!

02:08.028 --> 02:09.428
- Oh, I almost forgot.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.697
I have presents
for my favorite supes.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.631
- Oh.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.633
- Being helpful!

02:17.171 --> 02:20.339
- Wait, so he just loves
doing things for you?

02:20.341 --> 02:20.806
- Yes.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.741
- And he's looking
for a new job?

02:22.743 --> 02:23.308
- Yes.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.277
- BOTH: We need him
as our sidekick!

02:25.279 --> 02:27.045
- BOTH: No!

02:27.047 --> 02:29.214
- I stopped listening again,
did they say yes?

02:29.216 --> 02:30.516
- I think they did!

02:30.518 --> 02:31.049
- No!

02:31.051 --> 02:33.719
To have a sidekick means
you two would have to share.

02:33.721 --> 02:37.322
And sharing
brings out the worst in you.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.790
- Since when?

02:38.792 --> 02:41.059
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine!

02:41.061 --> 02:42.561
- [cracks]

02:43.464 --> 02:45.564
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine!

02:45.566 --> 02:47.399
- [snaps]

02:47.601 --> 02:49.334
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine!

02:49.336 --> 02:51.403
- [crash]

02:53.440 --> 02:56.408
- Still waiting for you
to make your point.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.345
- Sorry, guys, in order
for you to get a sidekick,

03:00.347 --> 03:03.081
you need us to sign
a Hero League permission slip.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.284
- Sorry, guys, in order
for you to get a sidekick,

03:05.286 --> 03:07.486
you need us to sign
a Hero League permission slip.

03:07.488 --> 03:11.056
I'm just repeating what he says
in case you didn't listen.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.626
- Thunder back!

03:14.628 --> 03:16.094
I'm back with your gifts.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.830
- Oh, whoa, Assista Boy!

03:18.832 --> 03:21.233
[gasps] A day at the spa?

03:21.235 --> 03:22.334
- Not just any spa.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.802
The Metroburg Super Spa.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.438
Relax while you wax.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.172
- This is too much.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.541
- Yeah, you're not even
our sidekick anymore.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.443
- Mm, but if you
refuse my gifts,

03:31.445 --> 03:33.579
it would turn me
into a sad monster.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.647
- Oh, whoa, no,
nobody wants that.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.682
- We happily accept.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.384
In fact, let's book
our spa day right now.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.285
- No, I'll call for you.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.388
If you don't get Cindy,
it's a waste of a day.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.192
- It's not fair!

03:47.194 --> 03:49.194
Assista Boy could
solve all our problems.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.230
We need him as our sidekick.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.498
- [mumbling] And he will be.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.133
- What?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.135
- I said, "And he will be."

03:57.137 --> 03:59.304
'Cause I'm totally gonna get
Mom and Dad to sign

03:59.306 --> 04:00.572
that sidekick permission slip.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.841
- What makes you think
that'll work?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.577
Oh, just tell me
when you're done eating!

04:07.214 --> 04:10.148
- ¶

04:10.150 --> 04:14.119
- Ladybug candy bars for sale!

04:14.121 --> 04:15.687
Will you guys buy some?

04:15.689 --> 04:20.492
- Sorry, but we're not allowed
to take candy from strangers.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.560
- Billy, it's Chloe.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.463
- I know, I just
don't have any money.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.665
- I'm the only one in my troop
who doesn't

04:26.667 --> 04:28.200
have a sweet tooth badge.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.269
I'll never get it.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.304
- How many customers
have you had?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.839
- Just one.

04:33.841 --> 04:34.506
- [humming]

04:34.508 --> 04:39.278
- Hank! You can't bring
a bunch of chocolate to the spa.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.746
- It relaxes me.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.414
- It's gonna melt in the sauna.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.250
- Barb, you are just
making it sound better.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.186
- Alright, kids, we're off
to the Metroburg Super Spa,

04:48.188 --> 04:49.488
so we'll see you later.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.425
- Thunderman, getting pampered!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.697
- Billy, we have to help
our little sister

04:58.699 --> 05:01.199
sell her candy bars.
It's our duty.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.235
- [laughs] You said doodie.

05:03.237 --> 05:04.569
- [buzzer sounds]

05:04.571 --> 05:05.537
- What?

05:05.539 --> 05:07.339
- Don't worry, Chloe, we're
gonna make sure you sell

05:07.341 --> 05:10.342
your candy bars so you can earn
that sweet tooth badge.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.710
- You're gonna help me?

05:11.712 --> 05:12.344
- Of course.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.680
Now, your first problem
is location.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.647
Right, Billy?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.515
- [laughs]

05:16.517 --> 05:18.617
I'm still laughing at doodie.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.351
[laughs]

05:19.353 --> 05:21.353
- In the meantime, let's find
a place where people

05:21.355 --> 05:24.723
are so desperate for food
that they'll eat anything.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.958
- Doodie-ville!

05:26.960 --> 05:28.493
- No, Splatburger.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.229
- Splatburger!

05:31.231 --> 05:33.432
- ¶

05:33.434 --> 05:36.301
- Okay, I have 20 minutes
to build a model London Bridge

05:36.303 --> 05:38.470
for my history project.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.240
Ah, fish and chips!

05:42.242 --> 05:45.277
- Phoebe, I have
a surprise for you.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.778
Come in!

05:47.247 --> 05:49.648
- I exist to assist!
- Ha!

05:49.650 --> 05:53.251
- Queen's crown, London Bridge
has fallen down!

05:56.390 --> 05:56.988
- You did it!

05:56.990 --> 05:59.458
How did you get Mom and Dad
to sign the permission slip?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.360
- Wasn't easy. I confronted them
in the fancy spa

06:01.362 --> 06:04.262
and explained how we're mature,
hardworking supes

06:04.264 --> 06:05.731
who can totally
share a sidekick.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.765
- I can't believe that worked.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.534
- It didn't,
so I forged their signatures.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.636
- ¶

06:11.638 --> 06:14.673
¶ What you see
is not what you get ¶

06:14.675 --> 06:17.709
¶ Living our lives
with a secret ¶

06:17.711 --> 06:20.712
¶ We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess ¶

06:20.714 --> 06:24.015
¶ Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest ¶

06:24.017 --> 06:27.753
¶ A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be ¶

06:27.755 --> 06:31.456
¶ But closer you might see
the crazy things we do ¶

06:31.458 --> 06:33.291
¶ This isn't make-believe ¶

06:33.293 --> 06:34.025
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:34.027 --> 06:37.696
¶ Just your average family
trying to be normal ¶

06:37.698 --> 06:39.464
¶ And stay out of trouble ¶

06:39.466 --> 06:43.502
¶ Living a double life ¶¶

06:46.473 --> 06:48.373
- You faked
Mom and Dad's signatures?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.775
We can't have
an unauthorized sidekick!

06:49.777 --> 06:52.744
- But he's an amazing
unauthorized sidekick!

06:52.746 --> 06:54.479
- Mom and Dad are gonna
ground us for life.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.982
- Okay, the only reason why
Mom and Dad won't let us have

06:56.984 --> 06:58.683
a sidekick is because
they think we can't share.

06:58.685 --> 07:02.554
But we can prove them wrong
by sharing Assista Boy.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.423
- Wait, why is he Assista Boy?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.858
He's clearly a man.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.626
- Stay on track, Phoebe.

07:07.628 --> 07:11.630
If we pull this off, we can keep
him as our sidekick forever.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.631
- It's too risky, Max.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.833
I'm just gonna tell him
he has to go.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.501
- [scoffs]

07:17.905 --> 07:18.837
- Homework's complete.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.772
Time for a treat.
- [bell rings]

07:20.774 --> 07:22.707
- I made brownies.

07:24.378 --> 07:27.078
- Oh, he's never leaving.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.480
- Right.

07:28.482 --> 07:28.947
- ¶

07:28.949 --> 07:31.983
- Thanks! Have a nice day!

07:31.985 --> 07:33.552
Cha-ching!

07:33.554 --> 07:36.021
- I knew she just needed to be
where people could see her.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.558
Nobody with a heart can resist
an adorable little girl.

07:40.127 --> 07:44.896
- Stop stealing my customers,
you diaper dork!

07:44.898 --> 07:47.666
- Come on, Mrs. Wong,
just let her sell her candy,

07:47.668 --> 07:48.567
and then we'll leave.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.402
- If I let her stay,
then tomorrow

07:50.404 --> 07:51.803
the gator scouts will show up.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.638
Soon, everyone's
eating candy bars

07:53.640 --> 07:55.941
and not my overpriced food!

07:55.943 --> 08:00.078
Everything on this side
of that burger is my property!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.880
So get lost!

08:01.882 --> 08:04.616
- You're right, we'll leave.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.488
- So long, losers.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.123
Wait! Why'd you losers stop?

08:12.125 --> 08:15.527
- 'Cause now we're not
on your property.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.561
- Yeah!

08:16.563 --> 08:18.830
I don't know what's happening.

08:18.999 --> 08:23.001
- Everything on this side of
that burger is public property,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.570
which means Chloe
can sell her candy bars,

08:25.572 --> 08:27.839
and you can't do
anything about it.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.808
- Yeah!

08:30.410 --> 08:31.142
- You win this round.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.613
But you'll never make a fool
of Olympia Wong again!

08:34.615 --> 08:36.581
- [bang]
- Oh!

08:37.518 --> 08:39.584
You didn't see that.

08:39.586 --> 08:42.654
- ¶

08:45.993 --> 08:49.728
- Just when you think the place
is clean, he finds new dirt.

08:49.730 --> 08:53.431
- He is the greatest thing
to ever happen to this lair.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.735
- I'm in the room!

08:56.737 --> 08:59.604
- [guitar strings plays]
- [hums]

08:59.606 --> 09:00.472
All done.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.608
You've...been assisted!

09:03.610 --> 09:06.111
- Uh, Assista Boy,
I hate to be that guy,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.713
but the slide
could use a polish.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.517
- I can't resist...
the need to assist.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.024
- Did he just--

09:19.026 --> 09:21.459
- Yes, he just
flew up the slide.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.728
- He's fantastic.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.630
I mean, earlier,
he got me an outfit

09:25.632 --> 09:26.698
for the spring fling and a date.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.133
Look, I don't even know
who this cutie is,

09:28.135 --> 09:32.170
but according to Assista Boy,
we're 99% compatible.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.171
- He can get us dates?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.640
I've just been using him
to do my homework,

09:35.642 --> 09:38.476
and laminate my socks
for no reason.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.178
- [slide squeaks]

09:40.681 --> 09:41.680
- Slide's polished!

09:41.682 --> 09:44.716
And...I found this inside.
- [gasps]

09:44.718 --> 09:46.785
My pan flute!

09:48.889 --> 09:49.487
- Wow.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.625
Wonder how that got jammed under
the second rock to the left?

09:53.627 --> 09:55.560
- Max, I missed regionals.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.696
Anyway, Assista Boy,
I was gonna go workout,

09:57.698 --> 09:59.564
and I could use
an Assista-spotter.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.534
- It would be an honor
to witness your fitness.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.502
- Uh, actually, Phoebe,

10:04.504 --> 10:06.671
he needs to find me a date
for the spring fling.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.273
- He's been helping you
for an hour already.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.942
- So what? Cleaning my filth
makes him happy.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.044
- That's not the point.
I wanna use him.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.212
- BOTH: No, I do.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.113
- No, me!

10:15.115 --> 10:16.648
- [horn sounds]

10:16.650 --> 10:19.684
- And there goes my hearing.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.620
- Oh, gee, sorry, guys.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.924
But I couldn't risk yelling and
losing control of my emotions.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.928
I can sense that you two
have a problem sharing.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.863
- No.
- Crazy.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.898
- Don't hide your problems
from me.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.936
I'm here to fix them
with...this.

10:38.972 --> 10:39.804
- "Team share schedule"?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.107
- Bingo. And all the time
is perfectly divided

10:42.109 --> 10:45.143
between Hero A and Hero B.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.911
- Alright. I'll be Hero A.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.013
That's what Phoebe would want.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.249
- Uh, no, no,
Phoebe don't want.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.954
- Guys, we'll settle this
the way I always do.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.723
Assista Boy can't stand a fight,
and so he'll choose

10:58.725 --> 10:59.457
and set things right.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.727
Eenie, meanie, moochie moo,
Hero A is surely you.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.996
- Yes, ha! I won!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.097
Come on, let's go.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.899
- [claps]

11:09.636 --> 11:11.136
- Oh. Okay. Good idea.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.171
We'll fly up the slide.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.008
Uh, ow! [groans]

11:17.010 --> 11:19.878
I landed on my pan flute!

11:19.880 --> 11:20.879
- ¶

11:20.881 --> 11:21.813
- Thank you.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.850
I make this look easy, baby!

11:25.852 --> 11:28.586
- You're gonna get that
sweet tooth badge in no time.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.822
- Yeah, nothing can stop us.

11:34.261 --> 11:39.297
- Get ready for a sugary
smackdown from the Wong scouts.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.199
- [whistle blows]

11:45.238 --> 11:47.772
- Oh come on!

11:48.008 --> 11:49.941
- Wong scouts?
That's not a thing.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.912
- Oh no? Then why do I have
all these badges?

11:53.914 --> 11:54.646
- She's legit.

11:54.648 --> 11:57.849
Badges don't lie.
- She's not legit.

11:57.851 --> 11:58.650
Don't worry, Chloe,

11:58.652 --> 12:01.252
those customers
will see right through her.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.956
- Candy bars,
get your candy bars.

12:04.958 --> 12:09.227
- My candy bars come
with a free Splat shake.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.229
- CROWD: [indistinct chatter]

12:11.231 --> 12:15.767
- Hey, she's cheating!

12:15.769 --> 12:16.501
- Don't worry, Chloe.

12:16.503 --> 12:20.071
I'm gonna go over there
and give her a piece of my mind.

12:21.007 --> 12:21.940
Yo, Wong!

12:21.942 --> 12:26.111
I'll have one chocolate Wong bar
and A free Splat shake.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.013
- Billy, get back here!

12:29.015 --> 12:31.816
- [whispers] Better make that
to go.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.351
- ¶

12:33.353 --> 12:36.187
- Ah, Assista Boy, that was one
of the best workouts

12:36.189 --> 12:36.855
I've ever had.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.858
Who knew cartwheels
could burn so many calories.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.259
- I did.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.161
Now you do.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.897
- Oh, thank you for sewing
pockets into my cape.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.199
Do you mind making one
for my phone?

12:48.201 --> 12:50.235
- Already did!

12:50.237 --> 12:52.103
- Can I hug you?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.938
- No.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.075
And look, I added
a Thunder-tanium shield mode

12:57.077 --> 12:58.710
for added protection.

12:58.712 --> 12:59.911
- ¶

12:59.913 --> 13:01.079
- [metal banging]

13:01.081 --> 13:01.980
- Ah!

13:01.982 --> 13:04.182
Where have you been all my life?

13:04.184 --> 13:05.984
- Mostly Papua New Guinea.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.086
But that's classified.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.357
- Hey, Assista Boy,
what are you doing up here?

13:12.359 --> 13:13.191
According to the schedule,

13:13.193 --> 13:14.893
you're supposed to be
finding me a date.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.261
- Yeah, I used
some of your time,

13:16.263 --> 13:17.762
but you can take
some of mine later.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.864
- So it's just okay
just to steal my time?

13:19.866 --> 13:21.432
- Technically,
I didn't steal it,

13:21.434 --> 13:24.002
I borrowed it without asking.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.971
- Well then, I guess it's okay
if I borrow your cape

13:26.973 --> 13:27.872
without asking.

13:27.874 --> 13:31.442
- [gasps] Give me
my cape of many pockets.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.745
- Hey, these pockets
were made on my time,

13:33.747 --> 13:35.280
which means they belong to me.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.415
- [fabric ripping]
- [gasps]

13:37.417 --> 13:42.020
I knew I should have done
a cross-stitch.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.887
- My cape.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.790
You ripped a pocket off my cape.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.294
Say goodbye
to everything you love!

13:50.363 --> 13:52.463
- [door opens]

13:52.465 --> 13:54.332
- Phoebe!

13:58.038 --> 13:58.903
- [grunts]

13:58.905 --> 14:01.272
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.074
Sorry.
- Phoebe, no!

14:03.076 --> 14:06.978
I spent all day watching
Assista Boy do that homework.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.379
- Well, watch this.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.114
- [wind blowing]

14:10.116 --> 14:11.416
- No!

14:11.418 --> 14:12.750
- Ha! It's funny,

14:12.752 --> 14:16.221
because he cares
about school now.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.356
- Thunder Twins,
please don't fight!

14:18.358 --> 14:19.457
- PHOEBE AND MAX:
Stay out of this!

14:19.459 --> 14:22.160
- Max, from now on, Assista Boy
is my sidekick. Let's go!

14:22.162 --> 14:24.329
- Hey, my sidekick's
not going anywhere!

14:24.331 --> 14:25.763
- He's mine!
- No, mine!

14:25.765 --> 14:27.198
- If you two don't
stop fighting,

14:27.200 --> 14:30.268
I'm gonna turn
into a sad monster.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.002
[sobbing]

14:31.004 --> 14:34.105
- Dude, you're a grown man,
get it together.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.407
- [growling]

14:39.212 --> 14:41.479
- Change my mind,
Max, you can have him.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.147
- ¶

14:45.418 --> 14:49.254
- ASSISTA BOY: [growling]

14:49.256 --> 14:51.122
- Okay, so when
Assista Boy gets sad,

14:51.124 --> 14:53.224
he turns into an angry
orange monster.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.826
- [growling]

14:54.828 --> 14:56.928
- [crash]

14:57.230 --> 15:00.798
- So glad we're in your room
and not mine.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.533
- Okay, we just need
to get through to him

15:02.535 --> 15:04.969
before he destroys my lair...
and me.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.037
And you, I guess.
- [growling]

15:06.039 --> 15:08.506
- Stop! Or I'll be forced to use
my powers on you,

15:08.508 --> 15:10.808
and I will show you no mercy.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.477
- [wind blowing]

15:12.479 --> 15:13.811
- [growling]

15:13.813 --> 15:17.115
- Oh, freeze breath
doesn't work on you.

15:17.117 --> 15:17.882
Okay, cool.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.917
Guess I'll use my other power.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.885
Running away
to call Mom and Dad. Bye!

15:20.887 --> 15:25.156
- [growling]

15:25.158 --> 15:27.258
- Alright,
settle down, big guy.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.863
I'm your boss, and I command you
to stop being scared!

15:31.865 --> 15:33.598
Don't you take another step.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.232
- [growls]

15:34.234 --> 15:37.101
- Okay, I'll give you that one.
Don't take another.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.270
You took it.
Don't like, not one bit!

15:39.272 --> 15:40.004
- [growling]

15:40.006 --> 15:42.073
- I don't like this either!
Put me down!

15:42.075 --> 15:44.008
- [growling]
- [crash]

15:46.146 --> 15:48.379
- I meant put me down gently!

15:50.050 --> 15:52.917
- Phone, phone,
where's my phone?

15:52.919 --> 15:55.453
- Uh, uh, don't worry, Phoebe,
I was able to get away.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.623
And he's way too big
to get up the slide--

16:01.061 --> 16:02.493
- Uh, he put the phone pocket

16:02.495 --> 16:04.429
right where
you think it would be.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.064
- [phone beeps]

16:06.066 --> 16:07.532
- MAX: Call Mom and Dad!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.334
- Got it!

16:09.903 --> 16:13.338
- Ah, Assista Boy
really knows his spas.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.475
- Guess you have to when sadness
turns you into a giant monster.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.543
[laughs]

16:18.545 --> 16:21.079
- Would have been a disaster
if we let him be

16:21.081 --> 16:23.047
Max and Phoebe's sidekick.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.482
- BOTH: [laughing]

16:24.484 --> 16:27.452
- Could I get
another hand, please?

16:30.590 --> 16:34.192
- [phone vibrating]

16:34.194 --> 16:37.462
- ¶

16:37.464 --> 16:39.931
- So call me back before the
giant monster manages to destroy

16:39.933 --> 16:42.900
the house and everything in it,
including us. Bye!

16:44.604 --> 16:45.403
It's quiet.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.471
Maybe Max calmed him down.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.473
- ASSISTA BOY: [growling]

16:48.475 --> 16:50.475
- Phoebe, do something!

16:50.477 --> 16:52.543
- [glass shattering]

16:52.545 --> 16:54.912
- Don't worry! I'll help you!

16:56.349 --> 16:58.116
- Seriously?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.318
- French doors aren't cheap.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.353
- ¶

17:02.355 --> 17:03.988
- Guys, this is hopeless.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.492
Mrs. Wong is on fire.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.227
- Fire!

17:09.229 --> 17:10.228
- [gunshot]

17:10.230 --> 17:13.498
- CROWD: [cheering]

17:13.500 --> 17:15.566
- Let's just go home.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.635
- No, if badges
were easy to get,

17:17.637 --> 17:19.370
they wouldn't be worth anything.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.539
- Yeah. You gotta work for them.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.240
- But how?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.342
- Mrs. Wong may have
a candy bar cannon,

17:24.344 --> 17:27.612
but we have something
even more powerful.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.515
The tears of a child!

17:30.517 --> 17:32.984
- That doesn't sound fair.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.719
Let's do it!

17:35.388 --> 17:39.323
Oh, why won't anybody
buy my candy?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.391
[crying]

17:40.393 --> 17:42.660
- Oh no, this poor little girl
is crying

17:42.662 --> 17:45.496
because nobody will buy
her candy bars.

17:45.498 --> 17:50.435
- These are actual tears
on this actual girl.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.172
- I just wanna be a good scout.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.274
- CROWD: Aw!

17:59.512 --> 18:03.448
- MRS. WONG: Wait!
Where are you all going?

18:03.450 --> 18:10.321
I can cry too if I had a heart,
or emotions, or a soul.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.689
- That was the last bar!

18:11.691 --> 18:12.523
- We sold out, Chloe!

18:12.525 --> 18:15.993
- I'm gonna get
my sweet tooth badge!

18:17.430 --> 18:20.031
- You made me look
like a fool again!

18:20.033 --> 18:24.569
I spent $700
on that candy bar cannon!

18:24.571 --> 18:25.636
- I know you're mad, Mrs. Wong,

18:25.638 --> 18:29.207
but at least we're getting
out of your hair.

18:29.209 --> 18:29.774
- Let's go.

18:29.776 --> 18:34.445
I gotta try this crying thing
on my Mommy and Daddy.

18:34.447 --> 18:38.249
- Ah, children are the worst!

18:39.419 --> 18:39.884
[grunts]

18:39.886 --> 18:42.720
- Don't worry, Max,
I'm still here to help you.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.257
- [grunts] Wah!

18:48.761 --> 18:51.462
- Your help causes
nothing but pain!

18:51.464 --> 18:53.464
- [growling]

18:53.466 --> 18:54.298
- Let's think about this.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.567
He turned into a raging monster
because we made him sad.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.302
Maybe we should just try
to make him happy.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.471
- Okay. He loves cartwheels.
Let's do that.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.073
- Okay.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.344
- Hey, buddy, how 'bout
them cartwheels?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.512
- [growling]

19:07.514 --> 19:09.680
- Uh, if a cartwheel
is what you want,

19:09.682 --> 19:15.720
then prepare
for some razzle daz--ahhhh!

19:17.423 --> 19:19.257
- ¶

19:19.259 --> 19:24.295
- Randy, can you hand me
my chocolate bar?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.564
- Hank, he's out of hands.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.368
- Ahhhh!

19:30.370 --> 19:32.436
[moaning]

19:32.438 --> 19:35.806
Have I got something
to tell you!

19:35.808 --> 19:36.841
But first...

19:36.843 --> 19:40.311
lay one of those hands on me,
will you, Cindy?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.445
- ¶

19:41.447 --> 19:44.849
- [pan flute music plays]

19:44.851 --> 19:47.351
- Phoebe, what are you doing?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.453
- Soothing the savage beast
with music.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.323
I call this
"Memories of Machu Picchu."

19:52.325 --> 19:55.626
- [pan flute music plays]

19:55.628 --> 19:57.595
- [wood crumbling]

19:59.699 --> 20:03.401
- Well, that's one good thing
that came from all this.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.736
- Gotta find a way
to make him happy!

20:05.738 --> 20:07.271
I have an idea.
- What?

20:07.273 --> 20:10.741
Stop leaving me with him!
- [growls]

20:10.743 --> 20:12.677
- Hey, uh, what
about impressions?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.278
[in New York accent]
I'm a New Yorker.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.713
This subway's late.
Forget about it.

20:15.715 --> 20:20.251
- [growling]

20:20.253 --> 20:21.786
- [thud]

20:21.788 --> 20:24.422
- You pan flute made him
hate my impression!

20:24.424 --> 20:27.358
- Maybe it'll make him happy
if we tell him how much

20:27.360 --> 20:28.025
we appreciate him.

20:28.027 --> 20:31.295
Assista Boy, I love
the cape you made me.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.863
Oh!

20:32.865 --> 20:34.832
See? The shield mode
protects me

20:34.834 --> 20:37.635
from the things you're lopping
at my head. Oooh!

20:39.572 --> 20:40.705
- [growling]

20:40.707 --> 20:41.339
- Whoa!

20:41.341 --> 20:44.375
- Get over here
and hide behind my cape.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.644
- [growls]
- Ah!

20:46.646 --> 20:49.146
- My bad, here, take
this corner, I'll take this one.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.414
We'll share it.
- Good idea.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.148
- [glass shatters]

20:51.150 --> 20:53.451
- Wow, we're actually sharing
something for the first time?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.820
- I guess so. At least we did it
once in our life

20:55.822 --> 20:58.256
before we're crushed
by a rampaging monster!

20:58.258 --> 21:01.592
- ASSISTA BOY: Oh,
bravo, Thunder Twins!

21:01.594 --> 21:03.861
- PHOEBE AND MAX: Assista Boy?

21:03.863 --> 21:04.495
- Phew!

21:04.497 --> 21:08.499
Ah, golly, Thunder Twins,
you two made me pretty sad.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.737
But seeing you share that
cape made me happy again.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.205
- Guess we never would have
learned all

21:14.207 --> 21:17.174
this if you hadn't tried
to smash us with yard junk,

21:17.176 --> 21:19.410
so thanks, Assista Boy.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.111
How 'bout that hug?

21:20.113 --> 21:22.813
- [chuckles] How 'bout no?
- Okay.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.718
- How 'bout we ground you guys?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.320
- We would have been here
sooner, but somebody

21:29.322 --> 21:35.626
wouldn't tell us what was going
on until after his massage.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.562
- Worth it!

21:38.564 --> 21:40.431
- We're so sorry about
all this, Assista Boy.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.633
Even if we were allowed
to have a sidekick,

21:42.635 --> 21:43.634
we wouldn't deserve you.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.237
- Yeah. We're gonna miss you,
big guy.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.371
I mean, not the big guy,

21:47.373 --> 21:48.706
the little guy
who likes to clean.

21:48.708 --> 21:52.710
- [chuckles] I'm gonna
miss you guys, too.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.679
I mean, when I think
of our time together,

21:54.681 --> 21:58.382
it turns me into a little bit
of a sad monster.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.650
[sobbing]

21:59.652 --> 22:01.819
- PHOEBE AND MAX: Not again!

22:03.656 --> 22:04.755
- I couldn't resist.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.525
- ALL: [laughing]

22:10.530 --> 22:22.773
- ¶

22:32.685 --> 22:38.289
