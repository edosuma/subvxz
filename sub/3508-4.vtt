<Font color=#FFFF00>Fool Me Once</font>

00:00.258 --> 00:01.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.264 --> 00:02.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.198 --> 00:04.924
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.385 --> 00:07.085
Who am I?

00:07.174 --> 00:08.313
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.314 --> 00:08.714
Castle.

00:08.748 --> 00:09.408
Castle.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.409
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.655 --> 00:13.845
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.955 --> 00:14.774
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.809 --> 00:15.829
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:15.864 --> 00:17.770
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.816 --> 00:19.402
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.403 --> 00:20.703
I get to be on her case.

00:20.737 --> 00:22.480
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.415 --> 00:23.591
And together, we catch killers

00:24.139 --> 00:25.827
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.828 --> 00:26.628
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.962 --> 00:27.656
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.757 --> 00:29.257
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:30.258 --> 00:32.258
(woman) # oh, oh #

00:36.659 --> 00:39.059
Everybody, settle down.
Quiet down, please.

00:39.260 --> 00:40.760
Come to the front.
You know your assigned seats.

00:40.761 --> 00:42.761
( children speaking indistinctly)

00:42.862 --> 00:43.462
Careful.

00:45.663 --> 00:46.463
Take your seats.

00:46.664 --> 00:47.364
Now listen,

00:47.665 --> 00:50.365
if you remember, the last time
we spoke with Fletcher,

00:50.866 --> 00:52.466
he had just entered
the polar ice cap.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.167
from Greenland, right here,

00:54.168 --> 00:55.568
headed toward the North Pole.

00:55.869 --> 00:56.569
Remember?

00:56.870 --> 00:59.170
Now he was supposed to ski
about 10 miles a day,

00:59.771 --> 01:03.871
which would have put him
right about here.

01:04.471 --> 01:05.372
( TV beeps, snow hisses )

01:05.773 --> 01:08.473
Oh, good. Right on time.
Now listen, everyone.

01:08.474 --> 01:11.674
Remember,
Fletcher can't hear us, right?

01:12.175 --> 01:13.475
So no yelling out questions,

01:14.076 --> 01:15.176
especially you, Kahlil.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.077
Hey, kids.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.078
( children ) Hi, Mr. Fletcher.

01:21.079 --> 01:23.679
I don't know if you can tell,
but a blizzard just blew in

01:23.680 --> 01:25.180
about an hour ago.

01:25.181 --> 01:27.481
And let me tell you,
it wasn't easy setting up camp

01:27.482 --> 01:29.382
in 50-mile-an-hour winds.

01:29.383 --> 01:30.383
( children ) ooh.
- good thing I was able to buy

01:30.384 --> 01:31.584
such a strong tent

01:31.685 --> 01:33.085
with all the, uh, money--
( thud )

01:33.286 --> 01:34.386
money you raised.

01:35.687 --> 01:37.087
Must be a polar bear out there

01:37.088 --> 01:39.088
looking for a little bit
of trouble, huh?

01:39.289 --> 01:42.789
Anyway, I want to tell you
about this herd of Caribou

01:42.790 --> 01:45.290
I saw yesterday
while I was out skiing.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.991
There were 12 of 'em,
including 4 calves

01:47.992 --> 01:50.592
who had just started to grow
the velvet on their horns.

01:50.593 --> 01:51.993
Oh, talk about cute.

01:52.194 --> 01:53.594
So there I am,

01:53.995 --> 01:56.095
and I'm trying to pull out
my camera when all--

01:57.196 --> 01:58.196
Wait, what are you...

01:58.397 --> 02:00.097
No, No, No, don't.
Don't! Don't! Aah!

02:00.098 --> 02:01.098
[ gunshot ]

02:06.099 --> 02:06.999
( doorbell buzzes )

02:10.300 --> 02:11.000
( buzz )

02:16.401 --> 02:18.801
Hi, I'm Dylan.
I'm here for Alexis.

02:20.402 --> 02:22.002
I'm her new violin teacher.

02:22.003 --> 02:23.903
Dylan, Hi.
Thanks for coming.

02:26.204 --> 02:26.904
Dad, let him in.

02:27.905 --> 02:28.705
Yeah.

02:32.706 --> 02:33.706
( mutters )

02:34.307 --> 02:35.407
(lowered voice)
What happened to Olga?

02:35.908 --> 02:36.508
(lowered voice)
She retired.

02:36.709 --> 02:37.709
So you went male model?

02:37.910 --> 02:39.910
Dylan goes to Julliard.
He's a musical prodigy.

02:40.211 --> 02:42.011
I was lucky to get
a lesson with him.

02:42.112 --> 02:44.912
Prodigies are supposed to be
all nerdy and awkward,

02:44.913 --> 02:46.113
not...that.

02:46.914 --> 02:50.414
(hums) Well, hello there.
I'm Martha.

02:50.315 --> 02:51.315
Hi. Dylan.

02:51.416 --> 02:54.716
Dylan. Oh, Alexis tells me
you're very talented.

02:54.717 --> 02:55.717
(chuckles)
and,

02:55.718 --> 02:56.718
very strong, I might add.

02:57.019 --> 02:57.919
- uh, gram.
ooh. Quite a grip.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
(laughs)

03:00.021 --> 03:02.521
Uh, why don't we get started?
I can assess where you are,

03:02.522 --> 03:04.322
and then tomorrow we can
start your lessons. Does that

03:04.523 --> 03:05.223
sound good.

03:05.224 --> 03:06.324
Yeah, my room's upstairs.

03:06.925 --> 03:07.725
Lead the way.

03:08.026 --> 03:10.726
Uh, wh-why don't you
do it down here?

03:10.927 --> 03:12.227
You know how I love
watching you play.

03:13.028 --> 03:13.928
Nonsense.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.429
She needs privacy,
not a performance.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.330
Spoken with
true artistic insight.

03:19.331 --> 03:20.231
Well, thank you.

03:20.232 --> 03:22.932
I'm an actor,
so it stands to reason.

03:24.033 --> 03:24.733
Well...

03:24.734 --> 03:25.534
(Dylan) So how have you been?

03:25.535 --> 03:26.735
He's a charming
you man.

03:27.436 --> 03:28.336
Well, I'm off.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.237
See you later, darling.

03:32.138 --> 03:32.838
I liked Olga.

03:32.839 --> 03:34.739
(cell phone rings
and beeps)

03:35.240 --> 03:35.840
Castle.

03:39.641 --> 03:40.541
(whispers)
Hey, Mike.

03:40.542 --> 03:41.342
Where's the body?

03:42.543 --> 03:43.243
You didn't tell him?

03:43.244 --> 03:44.044
Tell me what?

03:44.145 --> 03:45.045
And ruin the surprise?

03:45.546 --> 03:46.346
What surprise?

03:48.648 --> 03:49.548
Hey, kids.

03:50.149 --> 03:53.149
I don't know if you can tell,
but a blizzard just blew in

03:53.150 --> 03:54.350
about an hour ago...

03:54.551 --> 03:56.451
Do we have jurisdiction
in the North Pole?

03:56.552 --> 03:57.252
Wait for it.

03:57.253 --> 03:59.253
...50-mile-an-hour winds,
good thing that--

03:59.854 --> 04:02.754
...of Caribou I saw yesterday
while I was out skiing.

04:02.755 --> 04:03.955
(Beckett) Okay.
there comes the guy.

04:03.956 --> 04:05.256
there were 12 of 'em
including 4 calves...

04:06.257 --> 04:06.757
(Castle) Whoa.
- who had just started to grow

04:06.758 --> 04:07.958
- the velvet on their horns.
- (Beckett) We see the gun.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.759
I'm trying to pull out
my camera when all--

04:10.860 --> 04:12.060
Wait, what are you...

04:12.161 --> 04:13.761
No, No, No, don't.
Don't! Don't!

04:13.862 --> 04:14.762
[ gunshot ]

04:14.763 --> 04:17.563
That was awesome! I mean, well,
obviously it was horrible, but--

04:18.064 --> 04:19.064
That's not the Arctic.

04:19.464 --> 04:20.765
That's an apartment.
But where?

04:21.266 --> 04:22.166
Ryan, rewind it.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.067
I thought I saw something
when the camera was falling.

04:25.968 --> 04:27.168
Stop. Right there.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.369
Out the window
in the background.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.770
That's classic
upper West Side architetcture.

04:34.071 --> 04:35.571
Take a picture of it.
Send it to the precinct.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.472
See if any of the beat cops
recognize it.

04:37.473 --> 04:38.273
On it.

04:42.774 --> 04:44.874
Mr. Wheeler,
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

04:44.875 --> 04:45.875
This is Rick Castle.

04:46.576 --> 04:47.576
I just don't understand.

04:47.577 --> 04:48.877
Everything seened
on the up and up.

04:49.278 --> 04:50.478
He had Yale, PhD.

04:51.379 --> 04:53.179
When was the first time
that you met Mr. Fletcher?

04:53.580 --> 04:55.280
A few months ago.
He came into the school

04:55.281 --> 04:56.981
and made a presentation
to the school board--

04:57.382 --> 04:59.682
A month-long, one-man trip
to the North Pole.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.283
We agreed to help fund
the expedition.

05:01.284 --> 05:03.584
in exchange, Fletcher said
he would give

05:03.585 --> 05:05.585
a unique educational experience
for the kids,

05:05.586 --> 05:08.686
including weekly video reports
from the Artic Circle.

05:08.687 --> 05:09.787
How much did you raise?

05:09.788 --> 05:12.088
Between our school and others
in the area, around $50,000.

05:12.089 --> 05:12.489
hmm.

05:12.490 --> 05:14.490
(Castle whistles) (Beckett) Wow.
That's a lot of pemmican.

05:15.591 --> 05:18.691
A basic staple of the, uh,
polar explorer diet.

05:18.692 --> 05:20.692
High in fat and protein--
Basically, it's beef and grease

05:20.693 --> 05:21.993
kind of melted together
into a jerky.

05:22.094 --> 05:23.894
You think it'd be disgusting,
but surprisingly...

05:25.395 --> 05:26.495
I'll fill you in later.

05:26.896 --> 05:28.596
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Fletcher?

05:28.897 --> 05:30.397
He came by the school
two weeks age to pick up

05:30.398 --> 05:32.298
a stack of letters the kids
wrote to him for his trip.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
He was supposed to get on the
plant to Greenland the next day.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.400
We got an I.D. on the building.

05:37.401 --> 05:38.201
79th and Amsterdam.

05:38.202 --> 05:40.102
All right, tell Lanie
that we'll meet her there.

05:40.903 --> 05:42.003
( police radio chatter )

05:42.304 --> 05:43.004
(camera shutter clicking)

05:44.405 --> 05:46.205
Uniforms said the door
was unlocked when they got here.

05:46.606 --> 05:48.006
Either the victim left it
that way or, uh--

05:48.107 --> 05:49.507
or the killer had a key.

05:49.508 --> 05:50.108
mm-hmm.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.309
All right, talk to
the neighbors.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.810
See if Fletcher had
any regular visitors.

05:53.111 --> 05:56.011
But first, I'm thinking our vic
might have been a squirrel.

05:56.012 --> 05:57.312
Mm. I'll check the bedroom.

05:58.313 --> 05:59.513
I'm sorry, a squirrel?

05:59.514 --> 06:01.314
Likes to hide his nuts
for the winter.

06:02.715 --> 06:03.915
And by "nuts" you mean.

06:04.316 --> 06:05.216
- Valuables.
- Ah.

06:05.517 --> 06:07.517
Secrets, anything s guy
living a lie

06:07.518 --> 06:08.818
wouldn't want someone
to find.

06:10.219 --> 06:13.319
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.420
This reminds me of that movie
"Capricorn One,"

06:20.421 --> 06:21.921
But with, like,
a winterland twist.

06:22.122 --> 06:22.722
Yeah.

06:25.222 --> 06:26.222
Lanie, what do we got?

06:26.523 --> 06:29.423
Victim was shot in the face
with a large caliber bullet.

06:30.024 --> 06:31.724
- Ouch.
- Oh, I don't think he felt

06:31.725 --> 06:33.125
much with a bullet that size.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.526
Face shots usually indicate
a deep anger in the shooter.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.827
Literally trying to erase
what makes the victim a peron.

06:39.128 --> 06:41.428
Well, con men do leave
a wake of angry people.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.629
It's amazing
that this is all it took

06:43.630 --> 06:44.930
to fake two weeks
in the Arctic.

06:45.031 --> 06:47.731
Mm-hmm. The wonders
of modern technology.

06:48.232 --> 06:49.732
A lot of criminal today
don't take advantage,

06:50.133 --> 06:50.833
I blame the parents.

06:52.434 --> 06:56.034
I'll give this to Fletcher--
He did do his homework.

06:57.435 --> 07:00.035
Oh! This is a library book.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.036
Something tells me he wasn't
planning on returning it.

07:05.037 --> 07:05.937
You were right.

07:05.938 --> 07:07.838
Look what our little squirrel
was hiding in the air vent.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.139
Something tells me
our Steven Fletcher

07:13.140 --> 07:14.340
wasn't actually
Steven Fletcher.

07:14.541 --> 07:15.041
Hmm.

07:15.042 --> 07:17.642
Multiple I.D.s
usually indicates multiple cons.

07:17.643 --> 07:20.143
I'd say our killer is someone
who Fletcher duped.

07:20.944 --> 07:22.644
From the height of
the bullet hole in the tent,

07:22.645 --> 07:25.645
I'd say our shooter was anywhere
between 5'3" and 6'.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.146
Mm-hmm.

07:26.247 --> 07:27.747
I guess that rules out
the first graders.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.148
Unless one was standing
on another one's shoulders.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.749
Hiding inside
of a trench coat, maybe.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.450
(Castle snaps fingers)
Diabolical. I like it.

07:33.451 --> 07:34.351
Thank you.

07:34.352 --> 07:35.752
Lanie, I'm gonna need a rush
on the fingerprints.

07:35.753 --> 07:37.453
We're gonna need to know
who our victim really was.

07:37.454 --> 07:38.254
Okay.

07:38.255 --> 07:39.855
Let's bag all of this,
get it back to the station.

07:39.956 --> 07:41.056
- Right on.
- Um-hmm.

07:42.957 --> 07:43.857
(Ryan)
Just like cap, huh?

07:44.658 --> 07:45.658
(Esposito) If I climbed
in a tent,

07:47.659 --> 07:49.259
(Beckett)
Couple of U.S. passports.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.260
Hmm.

07:50.461 --> 07:52.261
- See ya.
- Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

07:52.262 --> 07:53.462
Oh, thank you.

07:53.563 --> 07:54.563
So have you read it?

07:55.664 --> 07:56.264
Read what?

07:56.365 --> 07:57.065
The book.

07:57.466 --> 07:58.266
What book?

07:58.967 --> 08:02.067
Oh, your book.
"Heat Wave."

08:06.268 --> 08:07.068
Well?

08:07.269 --> 08:08.669
I haven't gotten to it yet.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.070
What do you mean,
you haven't gotten to it yet?

08:11.371 --> 08:12.971
I'm sorry. I've just been
so busy with work.

08:12.972 --> 08:13.872
I haven't had time.

08:14.173 --> 08:16.273
You were all over me to get
a copy of that book,

08:16.574 --> 08:18.474
Do you have any idea how many
hoops I had to jump through

08:18.475 --> 08:20.275
just so my editor
wouldn't send an armed guard

08:20.276 --> 08:22.076
to watch over you
while you read it?

08:22.377 --> 08:23.577
The least you could do
is to...

08:25.878 --> 08:29.078
Oh. (chuckles) Oh.
I see what you're doing.

08:29.279 --> 08:30.079
I'm not doing anything.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.380
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.581
You're trying to push
my buttons,

08:33.582 --> 08:34.582
but it's not gonna work.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.482
Really?

08:35.484 --> 08:36.484
mm-hmm.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.485
'Cause it seems to be working
just great.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.086
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to input these I.D.s.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.787
into Vi-CAP to see if any of
Fletcher's other identities

08:44.788 --> 08:45.588
have been flagged.

08:45.689 --> 08:47.489
Where do you want all this stuff
from Fletcher's apartment?

08:47.490 --> 08:48.290
Right here.

08:48.391 --> 08:49.491
How come you have to
carry everything?

08:51.492 --> 08:52.392
Ryan hurt his back.

08:54.193 --> 08:56.693
( groans) We checked with
all of Fletcher's neighbors.

08:57.094 --> 08:59.094
None of 'em could remember
seeing anyone but Fletcher

08:59.095 --> 09:00.795
coming or going
from the apartment. Ah.

09:01.196 --> 09:03.096
And we called Yale.
Turns out Steven Fletcher

09:03.097 --> 09:05.797
Does have a PhD
in Wildlife Biology, only--

09:05.898 --> 09:08.798
Only their Steven Fletcher
is a 7-foot-tall Albino.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.999
No. 300-pound Hawaiian,
but close.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.300
(Ryan)
You know what I don't get?

09:12.301 --> 09:12.601
Mm-hmm.

09:12.602 --> 09:15.102
Why go to so much trouble to
create such an elaborate scam?

09:15.303 --> 09:16.503
Fletcher
must have spent weeks

09:16.504 --> 09:17.604
going through
all the prep work.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.705
I can give you
50,000 reasons why.

09:20.006 --> 09:22.006
Yeah, but for con men,
it's not just about the money.

09:22.407 --> 09:24.707
I mean, for them,
it's about the game.

09:25.408 --> 09:27.908
The-the thrill they get
from pulling a con?

09:27.909 --> 09:28.909
It's like a drug high.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.310
Con man was on drugs?

09:30.711 --> 09:33.011
No, sir. Castle was just
giving us psychological insight

09:33.012 --> 09:34.912
based on his extensive
experience as a fraud.

09:35.913 --> 09:36.613
(whispers)
Meow.

09:36.614 --> 09:37.714
Well, I just fielded
several phone calls

09:37.715 --> 09:39.515
from some very embarrassed
private schools,

09:39.516 --> 09:41.416
and they want this solved
quickly and quietly.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.317
Unfortunately,
it looks like our con man

09:43.318 --> 09:45.018
was running a whole
slew of cons.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.919
unraveling all of them
and finding the killer

09:46.920 --> 09:47.920
is gonna take some time.

09:48.621 --> 09:49.021
(beeps)

09:49.522 --> 09:50.522
or maybe not.

09:51.323 --> 09:51.723
(beeps)

09:52.024 --> 09:54.724
One of Fletcher's aliases conned
a woman named Patty Schultz

09:54.725 --> 09:56.725
out of her life savings
about a year ago.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.426
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

09:58.827 --> 10:01.127
Apparently Ms. Schultz
has spent several stints

10:01.128 --> 10:03.828
in Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital,

10:04.229 --> 10:06.329
and none of them voluntary.

10:08.330 --> 10:09.530
Straightjacket.

10:09.531 --> 10:17.531
<font color=#7FFF00># Castle 2x04 #</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>Fool Me Once</font>
Original Air Date on October 12, 2009

10:18.832 --> 10:20.332
Ms. Schultz
I'm, Detective Beckett.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.033
Is this about Sanchez? 'Cause,
you know, I only hit him

10:23.034 --> 10:24.934
because he was drilling holes
in the wall

10:24.935 --> 10:26.335
to watch me exercise.

10:26.336 --> 10:29.336
This isn't about Sanchez.
This is about him.

10:30.137 --> 10:33.337
Steven Fletcher--
also known as Steven Miles.

10:34.238 --> 10:35.438
Are you arresting me?

10:36.139 --> 10:37.739
Why would we arrest you?

10:37.740 --> 10:39.240
Because I killed him.

10:40.241 --> 10:43.141
Um, Mrs. Schultz,
you've just confessed to a crime.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.442
- I'm gonna read you your--
- in my mind

10:46.043 --> 10:47.143
Did you just say

10:47.244 --> 10:48.744
you killed him
in your mind?

10:48.745 --> 10:51.945
I mediatate--
an hour every day.

10:51.946 --> 10:54.646
It--Doctor's orders. And

10:54.647 --> 10:56.547
all I think about
are my cats...

10:57.948 --> 11:00.048
and killing
this son of a bitch.

11:00.649 --> 11:02.149
And it finally worked,
didn't it?

11:03.050 --> 11:03.850
Well, I'm not sure.

11:04.251 --> 11:05.951
How did you kill him
in your mind?

11:06.152 --> 11:07.552
With a belt sander.

11:08.553 --> 11:10.453
Where were you at 9:00 A.M.
this morning?

11:10.454 --> 11:11.354
At the Vet.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.955
Mr. Muffins has
high cholesterol, so--

11:14.056 --> 11:15.456
Okay. Thank you.
We're done.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.357
How did--How did
Mr. Fletcher con you?

11:17.858 --> 11:19.458
He said he was
a Cryogenist

11:19.459 --> 11:21.759
and that he would freeze me
and my cats

11:21.760 --> 11:23.160
so we could
be resurrected

11:23.261 --> 11:25.661
once science had conquered
the death barrier.

11:26.362 --> 11:27.162
And you believed him?

11:27.463 --> 11:28.963
Have you ever been duped?

11:29.264 --> 11:30.464
I've been married twice.

11:30.865 --> 11:32.865
You think I got suckered
because I'm crazy.

11:33.666 --> 11:34.566
Well, you're wrong.

11:34.867 --> 11:37.967
I have paranoid
personality disorder,

11:37.968 --> 11:39.968
which makes me the
most suspicious person

11:39.969 --> 11:40.869
you've ever met.

11:41.670 --> 11:43.470
And Steven just
made me feel safe

11:43.471 --> 11:44.971
for the first time in years.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.172
And then he vanished
with $60,000 of my money.

11:51.873 --> 11:54.073
That man could sell sand
to a camel.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.174
Thank you...

11:57.475 --> 11:58.075
for coming.

12:01.876 --> 12:03.376
Can I see his body?

12:06.077 --> 12:06.877
Uh...

12:08.278 --> 12:08.878
No.

12:11.379 --> 12:11.879
(whimpers)

12:12.480 --> 12:14.480
You know, I can't hel[
but be a little impressed

12:14.481 --> 12:15.481
with our boy Fletcher.

12:15.782 --> 12:16.782
Please tell me
you're kidding.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.283
Not on a personal level.

12:18.284 --> 12:20.084
Just more of
a professional one.

12:20.085 --> 12:21.285
I mean, one storyteller
to another.

12:21.686 --> 12:22.586
The guy's a master.

12:22.587 --> 12:23.487
He's a leech.

12:23.488 --> 12:26.488
He preys on innocent victims
and ruins their lives.

12:26.489 --> 12:28.589
Well, it looks our leech has
jumped up to the major leagues.

12:28.590 --> 12:29.390
What do you mean?

12:29.391 --> 12:32.091
One of Fletcher's identities was
recently engaged to be married.

12:32.092 --> 12:33.192
(Esposito)
To Elise Finnegan.

12:33.293 --> 12:34.793
Wait. Finnegan.
Where do I known that name?

12:35.094 --> 12:36.994
Her family owns
half of Park Avenue South.

12:37.195 --> 12:39.595
Our lovely bride-to-be is worth
a cool 100 million bucks.

12:39.696 --> 12:40.096
(whistles)

12:40.097 --> 12:41.897
Ooh.
Now I'm really impressed.

12:42.498 --> 12:44.298
(woman)
He wasn't a con man.

12:44.299 --> 12:45.699
(Beckett)
I'm afraid he was, Elise.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.200
We've already uncovered
two other scams,

12:47.201 --> 12:48.501
and I'm certain
we'll find more.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.202
No. No.
I don't believe you.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.003
Elise--

12:52.004 --> 12:53.004
(woman)
It's okay, Sue.

12:53.205 --> 12:55.405
They were getting married
next weekend.

12:55.606 --> 12:57.206
Elise was so excited.

12:57.807 --> 12:59.207
How long
did she know Fletcher?

12:59.608 --> 13:00.408
Six month.

13:00.409 --> 13:01.809
That's quite
the whirlwind romance.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.910
It was love at first sight
for both of them.

13:03.911 --> 13:06.311
So there were no clues
that he was setting her up?

13:06.412 --> 13:08.812
Stories that didn't add up
or bills he couldn't pay?

13:08.813 --> 13:11.613
He insisted on, uh,
paying for the wedding

13:11.614 --> 13:14.414
even though the cost
was substantial.

13:14.915 --> 13:17.715
He seemed to live
to make her happy.

13:18.016 --> 13:21.016
That's because making her happy
was vital to his con.

13:21.017 --> 13:21.917
You're wrong.

13:22.918 --> 13:25.318
I have been rich
my whole life, Detective.

13:25.719 --> 13:28.019
So if there's one thing
I've learned, it's how to spot

13:28.020 --> 13:30.420
a man who's only interested
in me for my money.

13:31.221 --> 13:32.821
Steven wasn't like that. He...

13:34.322 --> 13:35.922
He love me
for me.

13:37.223 --> 13:39.023
I can't believe
how naive she's being.

13:39.124 --> 13:42.324
even with overwhelming evidence
that her fiancé was a con man,

13:42.325 --> 13:43.925
she still believes
he loved her.

13:43.926 --> 13:45.426
People see
what they want to see.

13:45.527 --> 13:46.827
It's what con artists
prey on.

13:47.628 --> 13:48.828
It's really kind of
a psychopathy--

13:48.829 --> 13:51.629
to be so cold that you can
look someone in the eye,

13:51.630 --> 13:53.630
tell them that you love them
and then rob them blind

13:53.631 --> 13:55.131
without the
slightest remore.

13:55.132 --> 13:57.932
Whoa. I just flashed back
to the eighth grade.

13:57.933 --> 14:00.733
Sherry Ort--broke my heart
stole my lunch money.

14:00.734 --> 14:01.734
(cell phone rings and beeps)
Beckett.

14:01.735 --> 14:03.235
Then she laughed about it
with her friend.

14:03.836 --> 14:05.036
All right, thanks.

14:05.437 --> 14:06.037
Well?

14:06.138 --> 14:07.538
No match on
Fletcher's fingerprints.

14:08.239 --> 14:09.639
We still don't know
his real identity.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.240
(Montogmer)
What you got?

14:12.441 --> 14:14.541
Trying to find a clue to
the con that killed Fletcher,

14:14.542 --> 14:17.342
but it looks like our guy
was a criminal overachiever.

14:18.143 --> 14:18.743
(Ryan laughs)

14:19.344 --> 14:19.844
What?

14:19.845 --> 14:21.945
Oh, you know those
Nigerian e-mail scams?

14:21.946 --> 14:23.446
Oh. Fletcher didn't pull
one of those?

14:23.447 --> 14:26.047
No. It looks like someone
tried to pull one on him.

14:26.048 --> 14:27.548
Fletcher conned the guy
out of 10 grand.

14:28.249 --> 14:29.549
Man, our boy
was good.

14:29.550 --> 14:30.350
Damn good.

14:30.351 --> 14:32.651
Don't be so impressed.
The guy was a criminal.

14:32.652 --> 14:35.452
Oh, no, there's something
about a-a well played con

14:35.453 --> 14:37.253
that just makes you want
to tip your hat, though.

14:37.254 --> 14:39.854
and they have such great names--
the Spanish prisoner,

14:39.855 --> 14:41.755
The pig in the poke,
the pigeon drop.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.056
Oh, I love
a good con movie--

14:43.057 --> 14:44.957
"House of Games",
"Catch Me if you Can."

14:44.958 --> 14:46.358
(mouth full)
"Ocean's Eleven," baby.

14:46.359 --> 14:48.359
"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
(imitates Steve Martin)
"Mother?"

14:50.161 --> 14:51.261
(imitates Steve Martin)
"Not Mother?"

14:51.262 --> 14:52.262
(Montgomery laughs)

14:52.763 --> 14:55.663
For my money, it starts
and it ends with "The Sting."

14:55.664 --> 14:56.464
Oh.

14:56.465 --> 14:58.065
How about you Beckett?
What's your favorite?

14:58.066 --> 14:58.966
I hate con movies.

14:59.067 --> 14:59.767
(Castle and Esposito)
What?

14:59.768 --> 15:00.868
Really?

15:00.869 --> 15:04.069
How can you hate "The Sting"?
It, like, what, took 20 Oscars?

15:04.070 --> 15:04.970
Something like that.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.171
Because the only people
that get conned

15:07.172 --> 15:09.472
in a con movie
are the audience members.

15:09.673 --> 15:12.673
You can't invest in anything
because nothing is real.

15:12.674 --> 15:13.874
That's what makes it fun.

15:14.075 --> 15:15.875
Well, it wasn't fun
to these kids--

15:16.176 --> 15:18.676
The ones from Wheeler's class
who wrote to Fletcher?

15:19.377 --> 15:21.477
"Dear Mr. Fletcher,
when do Polar Bears sleep?"

15:21.978 --> 15:24.778
"Dear Mr. Fletcher, do Penquins
really wear tuxedos?"

15:25.079 --> 15:25.979
Penguins are South Pole.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.980
Hey, these are 6-year-old kids.

15:28.181 --> 15:29.381
And he scammed them.

15:29.782 --> 15:31.582
You guys still impress
by this dirtbag?

15:31.583 --> 15:33.983
If you were just scamming
these kids,

15:34.584 --> 15:35.884
Why would you
write them back?

15:35.885 --> 15:37.185
'Cause it's all
a part of the con.

15:37.486 --> 15:39.186
Yeah...
I'm not sure.

15:39.187 --> 15:41.687
I mean, if you were just
a greedy monster,

15:41.688 --> 15:44.488
would you really bother
writing back to all of them?

15:44.489 --> 15:45.189
He's got a point.

15:45.190 --> 15:45.590
(Esposito)
Yeah.

15:45.591 --> 15:46.791
Oh, now who's
the sucker?

15:49.592 --> 15:50.192
Sir.

15:51.093 --> 15:51.993
Sucker or no sucker,

15:52.194 --> 15:54.094
clearly there's more to
this guy than meets the eye.

15:55.995 --> 15:57.295
(Ryan)
Busted.

15:57.296 --> 15:58.796
(Clicks tongue)

15:59.096 --> 16:00.396
Shut up, Esposito.

16:00.797 --> 16:02.497
All right, I'm gonna
leave you guys to it.

16:03.698 --> 16:04.998
Where you going?
It's early.

16:05.099 --> 16:05.899
I got plans.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.200
Oh, you have a date,
don't you?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.001
No.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.502
You liar.
Who's the unlucky guy?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.803
Ha Ha. Yeah, right.
See you guys in the morning.

16:12.804 --> 16:13.704
All right,
see you tomorrow.

16:13.705 --> 16:14.505
Careful.

16:16.306 --> 16:17.306
Okay, so who is it?

16:17.307 --> 16:18.407
- I don't know.
- Got me.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.608
So she hasn't
mentioned anyone?

16:20.609 --> 16:21.709
In case you
haven't noticed,

16:21.710 --> 16:24.910
Beckett isn't exactly
what you'd call a "sharer."

16:25.011 --> 16:26.811
Why do you care
anyway, Castle?

16:27.112 --> 16:28.712
Do you have
some unresolved feelings?

16:28.713 --> 16:29.513
mm.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.314
For Beckett?

16:30.315 --> 16:31.215
(Esposito)
Yeah.

16:31.216 --> 16:32.616
The woman
hates con movies.

16:32.617 --> 16:37.617
(Mozella's "Can't Stop" playing)

16:43.318 --> 16:45.618
# speak to me #

16:46.519 --> 16:49.819
# read my mind #

16:51.220 --> 16:53.820
# fill your mouth #

16:54.721 --> 16:56.021
# with flesh #

16:56.822 --> 16:57.822
# and wine #

16:58.623 --> 17:01.323
# and I'll be yours #

17:01.724 --> 17:03.424
# just give #

17:03.425 --> 17:05.224
# me time #

17:05.226 --> 17:06.925
# mm #

17:09.527 --> 17:12.227
# give me time #

17:13.828 --> 17:17.728
# and I just can't stop #

17:18.529 --> 17:21.329
# Lord, I can't stop #

17:21.329 --> 17:22.630
# myself #

17:22.631 --> 17:25.231
# I can't stop #

17:26.531 --> 17:29.232
# Lord, I can't stop #

17:29.233 --> 17:31.333
# myself #

17:31.634 --> 17:33.334
# now #

17:33.335 --> 17:35.335
##

17:35.336 --> 17:43.436
( violin music playing)

17:44.237 --> 17:45.737
I thought you said
her lesson was tomorrow.

17:46.238 --> 17:47.638
Oh, Dylan
had a cancellation.

17:47.639 --> 17:49.539
Alexis begged him to let her
take the slot.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.540
(Alexis) So it's B-flat
and C-sharp, right?

17:52.541 --> 17:53.541
(Dylan speaks indistinctly)

17:54.042 --> 17:54.842
What are you doing?

17:54.943 --> 17:55.743
Nothing.

17:55.744 --> 17:56.744
(Dylan) Rest.
Beautiful.

17:57.745 --> 17:58.945
(Alexis) Right, I know
I keep forgetting that rest.

17:58.946 --> 17:59.946
Very nice.
(song ends)

18:01.447 --> 18:02.347
Why'd it just get
so quiet?

18:03.348 --> 18:04.548
Maybe he's teaching her
something.

18:04.849 --> 18:07.049
Maybe he's filling her head
full of lies.

18:07.450 --> 18:08.950
What are you
talking about?

18:09.451 --> 18:11.051
All right, that's it.
I'm going up there.

18:11.052 --> 18:12.052
Oh.

18:13.753 --> 18:16.153
So when I start the piece,
should it be up-bow?

18:16.554 --> 18:18.054
- Ah, Yeah, I would.
- Okay.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.355
Oh, hey, you guys. I had
no idea you were even here.

18:20.556 --> 18:22.656
Well,  she's a
very talented girl.

18:22.657 --> 18:23.957
And a real hard worker.

18:23.958 --> 18:25.858
So, um,
practice your sautillé,

18:25.859 --> 18:27.659
and we'll take another stag
at Brahms next week,

18:27.760 --> 18:28.460
Okay, great.

18:29.161 --> 18:29.861
Have a good night.

18:29.862 --> 18:30.462
You too.

18:30.563 --> 18:31.563
Night, Dylan.

18:31.564 --> 18:32.564
Bye.

18:34.665 --> 18:35.465
You be safe.

18:36.466 --> 18:37.666
(door closes)

18:39.467 --> 18:40.267
I don't trust him.

18:41.668 --> 18:42.268
What? Why?

18:42.269 --> 18:43.569
What do we really know
about this guy?

18:44.070 --> 18:45.670
I know that he's
an amazing violinist

18:45.671 --> 18:46.871
and a really great teacher.

18:47.372 --> 18:48.372
Olga was a great teacher.

18:48.373 --> 18:50.573
Olga kept a tissue
up her sleeve

18:50.574 --> 18:51.874
and smelled like
hard candy.

18:53.275 --> 18:54.375
What's this about, Dad?

18:54.376 --> 18:55.576
I just don't think
that you realize

18:55.577 --> 18:57.877
that what you see
is not always what you get.

18:57.878 --> 19:00.378
I mean. how do you know that
Dylan really goes to Juilliard?

19:00.379 --> 19:01.279
Did you call the school?

19:01.580 --> 19:02.080
No.

19:02.081 --> 19:02.881
Check his transcripts?

19:02.982 --> 19:03.982
No, but, Dad, I--

19:03.983 --> 19:05.383
Okay, I don't think you should
take any more lessons

19:05.384 --> 19:06.684
from this guy until he's been
properly vetted.

19:06.985 --> 19:09.985
I want credit check, school
reports, maybe even a polygraph.

19:10.286 --> 19:12.386
Okay, you're officially
out of control.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.387
No, I'm not.
And back me up here.

19:14.388 --> 19:16.788
You want her violin teacher
to take a lie detector test?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.389
You're off the
reservation, kiddo.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.590
Okay, you know what?
You're cut off?

19:19.591 --> 19:20.391
- Oh.
- Dad.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.392
No, you know what?
I am the grown up here.

19:22.393 --> 19:23.693
Oh, this is scary.

19:23.694 --> 19:25.494
And I say no more lessons
from this guy

19:25.495 --> 19:26.695
until we've got him
checked out.

19:28.296 --> 19:28.896
What?

19:29.297 --> 19:31.897
I finally find a teacher
that I connect with,

19:31.898 --> 19:33.898
who's as exicited about music
as I am.

19:34.499 --> 19:35.399
Why are you trying
to ruin it?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.400
I'm not. I'm just...

19:38.501 --> 19:39.201
Hey.

19:39.202 --> 19:40.202
(signs)

19:42.203 --> 19:43.103
What's going on with her?

19:43.104 --> 19:46.104
Besides your unreasonableness?
Hormones.

19:47.005 --> 19:48.005
What's your excuse?

19:50.000 --> 19:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:58.406 --> 20:01.206
Okay, Castle,
what was so important

20:01.207 --> 20:03.007
that you had to cut
my sparring session short?

20:03.008 --> 20:05.908
Just that I cracked this case
wide open.

20:06.009 --> 20:08.009
You know, the thought of you
fighting in a ring

20:08.010 --> 20:10.310
with another woman--
strangely arousing.

20:10.311 --> 20:12.411
Who says I was sparring
with a woman?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.412
Oh, your mystery date.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.613
Oh, do I detect
some jealousy?

20:17.614 --> 20:17.714
Me, jealous? Ha!

20:18.415 --> 20:19.715
Double Ha!

20:21.416 --> 20:23.216
What if I told you
that my date

20:23.217 --> 20:25.317
was with your book?

20:25.518 --> 20:26.318
Really?

20:27.319 --> 20:28.219
No.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
God, you're easy.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.121
Give me your
case-breaking information

20:33.781 --> 20:36.832
Well, I went a little
"Daddy Dearest" on Alexis,

20:36.842 --> 20:37.515
and it got me thinking.

20:37.516 --> 20:40.016
If I can go this crazy
over a violin teacher.

20:40.225 --> 20:41.483
How crazy would I go
if my daughter

20:41.484 --> 20:43.184
was about to marry
a scam artist?

20:43.593 --> 20:45.343
Crazy enough to kill, maybe?

20:45.772 --> 20:46.476
- That is--

20:46.477 --> 20:47.377
- Inspired?
- No.

20:47.378 --> 20:47.878
-  Brilliant?
- mnh-mnh.

20:47.879 --> 20:48.679
- Genius?
- Unh-unh.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.780
-What?
- Thin.

20:49.847 --> 20:50.363
- Oh

20:50.373 --> 20:51.463
We don't have
the slightest indication

20:51.464 --> 20:53.764
that Elise's father knew
that Fletcher was a con artist.

20:54.073 --> 20:57.014
Maybe not, but Castle here
suggested that we check

20:57.024 --> 20:59.402
gun registration records
for Gerry Finnegan.

20:59.412 --> 21:00.377
and guess who happens to own

21:00.378 --> 21:02.478
the same caliber handgun
as our murder weapon.

21:02.587 --> 21:03.848
- Who?
- Gerry Finnegan.

21:03.883 --> 21:05.251
Shut the front door!

21:05.261 --> 21:07.766
No time for dirty talk,
Go get changed.

21:08.646 --> 21:10.315
I keep it
locked in the safe.

21:10.325 --> 21:11.818
Hasn't been fired
in years.

21:12.253 --> 21:13.915
Did anyone else
have the combination?

21:13.950 --> 21:14.954
No one.

21:17.701 --> 21:20.586
Hasn't been fired recently
or cleaned.

21:22.163 --> 21:24.067
I'd like to take it
to the lab if you don't mind.

21:24.077 --> 21:25.081
Certainly.

21:25.234 --> 21:26.466
- Mr. Finnegan.
- Hmm?

21:26.476 --> 21:28.570
One father to another,

21:29.256 --> 21:31.745
I just can't believe
that you never had the urge

21:31.780 --> 21:33.719
to check out your
future son-in-law.

21:33.729 --> 21:35.897
I mean, you never thought
for a moment that maybe

21:35.932 --> 21:38.179
Fletcher wasn't what he was
making himself out to be?

21:38.189 --> 21:39.189
I didn't think.

21:39.224 --> 21:40.224
I knew.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.519
Two weeks ago, I hired a private
investigator to look into Steven.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.817
Not that I was suspicious
I wasn't.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.579
I just thought
better safe than sorry.

21:49.589 --> 21:51.149
I was shocked
when he called to tell me

21:51.150 --> 21:53.250
that Steven was a fraud.

21:53.651 --> 21:55.483
Then I got angry.

21:55.702 --> 21:56.702
Please.

21:58.334 --> 21:59.836
I confronted Steven.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.479
I told him
I was going to expose him.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.786
and have the wedding
called off.

22:04.821 --> 22:07.991
Well, he begged
me not to.

22:08.602 --> 22:11.748
He said he was head over heels
in love with Elise,

22:11.783 --> 22:14.478
wanted to spend the rest
of his life with her.

22:16.358 --> 22:18.831
(chuckles) I told him
I wasn't buying it,

22:19.061 --> 22:22.534
but he promised
that he was done with cons,

22:22.544 --> 22:25.171
that the only reason
that he was still pretending

22:25.181 --> 22:27.504
to be a polar explorer
was for the kids.

22:27.539 --> 22:29.007
He didn't want
to let them down.

22:29.042 --> 22:31.468
He was a professional liar,
Mr. Finnegan.

22:31.678 --> 22:33.223
Yes, I know that.

22:33.824 --> 22:37.127
But what ultimately
convinced me was the prenup.

22:37.264 --> 22:39.777
He said I could draw up
any document,

22:39.812 --> 22:43.036
cut him out of our fortune
entirely if I wanted,

22:43.071 --> 22:44.418
and he would sign it.

22:44.428 --> 22:47.082
After a lifetime of greed,
he said,

22:47.092 --> 22:50.263
he'd finally found something
more important than money--

22:50.960 --> 22:53.021
- Love.
- And you believed him?

22:53.056 --> 22:54.290
Yes, I did.

22:54.325 --> 22:57.796
So I never said a word
about it to anybody.

22:58.868 --> 23:01.979
and then when you
showed up here yesterday,

23:02.163 --> 23:04.382
I...I-I just
couldn't tell Elise.

23:04.914 --> 23:06.652
The private investigator
that you hired,

23:06.653 --> 23:08.153
did he take
any photographs?

23:08.262 --> 23:09.265
Yes.

23:09.526 --> 23:11.193
He followed Stevem
for a week.

23:11.228 --> 23:13.619
He offered me the photos,
but I said I didn't want

23:13.620 --> 23:16.620
them in the house
were Elise might see them.

23:17.011 --> 23:18.195
What are you thinking?

23:18.957 --> 23:19.704
That Fletcher's killer.

23:19.805 --> 23:21.805
might be in one
of those photographs.

23:22.168 --> 23:22.854
You think it's possible

23:22.855 --> 23:24.855
that Fletcher was
telling Gerry the truth?

23:24.964 --> 23:27.470
That he's suddenly a con man
with a heart of gold? No.

23:27.505 --> 23:28.727
That's just another con.

23:28.762 --> 23:29.834
Who, Who.

23:29.869 --> 23:31.680
You don't think
people can change?

23:32.146 --> 23:33.153
No.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.712
I've seen too many
repeat offenders

23:35.713 --> 23:37.713
to believe for one second
that a guy who promises

23:37.722 --> 23:40.587
never to beat his wife again
actually won't.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.552
- That's a pretty bleak attitude.
- Not bleak.

23:43.587 --> 23:44.798
Realistic.

23:47.357 --> 23:48.422
After Mr. Finnegan hired me,

23:48.423 --> 23:51.023
I followed your boy
night and day.

23:51.032 --> 23:53.765
It became clear pretty fast
he was a grifter.

23:54.003 --> 23:55.318
Hello.

23:55.353 --> 23:56.445
What?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.059
- Isn't that
- Jim Wheeler.

24:00.069 --> 24:02.460
First grade
teacher extraordinaire.

24:02.773 --> 24:04.641
- When was this taken?
- Ten days ago.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.899
When Fletcher was supposed
to be in the Artic.

24:07.128 --> 24:09.489
Looks like Mr. Wheeler
was in on the scam.

24:15.090 --> 24:15.690
Um..

24:18.269 --> 24:20.077
Okay, I... I'm not
gonna lie to you.

24:20.112 --> 24:22.154
Really? 'Cause clearly,
you're pretty good at it.

24:22.249 --> 24:25.722
(sighs) Listen, I realized
that Fletcher was faking it

24:25.757 --> 24:26.972
when I discovered
that the pictures

24:26.973 --> 24:28.973
in his promotional booklet
were photoshopped.

24:28.982 --> 24:30.470
So you figured you'd make
a few bucks.

24:30.471 --> 24:31.871
rather than,

24:32.058 --> 24:34.087
I don't know,
protect your students?

24:34.122 --> 24:36.352
No. I-I know
this sounds crazy, but...

24:37.456 --> 24:38.771
the kids were learning.

24:38.806 --> 24:40.784
Fletcher loved those kids,
and they loved him.

24:40.794 --> 24:42.864
Sure, he was faking the trip,
technically,

24:42.899 --> 24:43.973
but he went out of his way

24:43.974 --> 24:46.774
to provide a dynamic,
fact-filled presentation.

24:46.783 --> 24:48.154
I just figured,
if he was making money on it,

24:48.155 --> 24:50.955
why shouldn't I?
Nobody was getting hurt.

24:51.001 --> 24:53.533
He was scamming little kids,
and you were his accomplice.

24:53.568 --> 24:56.272
Any jury in the world
would convict you of that.

24:56.282 --> 24:57.301
Jury?

24:58.286 --> 24:58.955
I didn't kill him.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.556
I was standing right here
when he was murdered.

25:00.590 --> 25:02.780
Doesn't mean I won't prosecute
you for criminal fraud.

25:02.790 --> 25:04.335
Now you want
to stay out of jail,

25:04.370 --> 25:06.781
You better point us
towards Fletcher's killer.

25:07.029 --> 25:09.700
Listen, I-I swear,
I don't know who killed him.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.181
Have you spoken
to his partner?

25:12.216 --> 25:13.260
- Partner?
- Partner?

25:13.295 --> 25:13.911
I guess that's who
she was.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.312
She was with him at the café
when I met him.

25:16.321 --> 25:17.875
She's in the picture.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.534
Where?

25:23.581 --> 25:24.732
Hard to see.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.193
Do you have
a magnifying glass?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
Better.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.955
That's Elise Finnegan,
Fletcher fiancé.

25:40.470 --> 25:43.224
Who is conning
whom here?

25:44.308 --> 25:44.812
First you tell me

25:44.813 --> 25:47.713
that you have no idea
that Fletcher is a con man.

25:47.885 --> 25:49.103
And then I find
a picture of you

25:49.104 --> 25:51.504
witnessing him make a payoff
during one of his scams.

25:51.538 --> 25:53.281
That's not what it was.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.636
- Then what was it?
- I can't...

25:57.972 --> 26:00.906
Elise, the man
that you loved is dead.

26:00.941 --> 26:03.220
I am trying to find
his killer.

26:03.666 --> 26:04.742
Help me.

26:08.926 --> 26:11.139
Steven wasn't a con man.

26:11.149 --> 26:12.983
- Elise, we--
- He wasn't.

26:13.226 --> 26:15.015
He was in the CIA.

26:15.381 --> 26:17.004
- This is the best case ever
- Shut up.

26:17.014 --> 26:19.010
What makes you think
he's in the CIA?

26:19.040 --> 26:20.595
A month
after we started dating,

26:20.596 --> 26:23.896
he told me that he couldn't bear
lying to me anymore.

26:24.025 --> 26:26.269
He wasn't really
a corporate lawyer,

26:26.299 --> 26:29.781
he was a CIA agent
on a top-secret case.

26:29.811 --> 26:32.513
And what part of this case
involves conning first graders?

26:32.543 --> 26:34.837
Well, that was part
of his mission.

26:35.418 --> 26:36.214
Next you're gonna tell me

26:36.215 --> 26:38.415
that Wheeler
was also a secret agent.

26:39.524 --> 26:41.370
- Oh, comeon.
- Think about it.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.070
Wheeler works
at the International School.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.611
Half of those students
are the children

26:45.612 --> 26:47.312
of U.N. diplomats--

26:47.341 --> 26:50.250
Syria, China, the Middle East.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.937
Getting close to their kids
allowed Steven unique access

26:53.967 --> 26:56.565
to some of our country's
worst enemies.

26:56.595 --> 26:58.950
- That is--
- Pretty smart.

26:59.917 --> 27:03.237
Steven wasn't killed
for being a con man,

27:03.267 --> 27:06.237
he was killed
for his intelligence work.

27:07.384 --> 27:08.437
No.

27:08.719 --> 27:10.303
- I'm just saying--
- No.

27:10.493 --> 27:14.103
<i>- You can't deny it's a possiblility...
- He is not in the CIA.</i>

27:16.222 --> 27:17.870
I'll bet you a dollar.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.816
All right.
You're on.

27:21.217 --> 27:21.617
(keypad beeping)

27:21.907 --> 27:24.796
- Who are you calling?
- My guy in the CIA.

27:24.826 --> 27:26.508
You have a guy
in the CIA?

27:26.824 --> 27:29.522
When you gonna learn?
I've got a guy everywhere.

27:29.866 --> 27:32.854
Thai food is pleasing
to the tongue.(beep)

27:33.948 --> 27:35.233
Secret code.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.989
He'll call me back.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.178
I met agent Gray when I was
researching "Storm Warning".

27:42.188 --> 27:43.105
Now this guy was invaluable

27:43.106 --> 27:48.506
for the really hard-core
secret agent stuff.

27:46.535 --> 27:48.632
This guy is a machine.

27:49.194 --> 27:51.942
I've interviewed
serial killers, hiy men.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.343
- Agent Gray?
- mm-hmm.

27:53.344 --> 27:55.944
By far the deadliest man
I've ever met.

27:57.012 --> 27:59.003
He once killed
a North Korean agent

27:59.004 --> 28:00.404
with a melon baller.

28:00.433 --> 28:02.970
It was an
ice cream scoop, Castle.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.348
and that information
was supposed to remain private.

28:05.478 --> 28:07.554
- Sorry.
- Agent Gray.

28:07.584 --> 28:10.511
Not quite what I pictures
based on Castle's description.

28:10.541 --> 28:13.621
I live in a world where nothing
is as it seems, Detective.

28:13.651 --> 28:14.887
For good reason.

28:14.917 --> 28:17.043
Transoarency gets you killed.

28:17.073 --> 28:19.277
Didn't you use that line
in "Storm Warning"?

28:19.307 --> 28:21.551
Yeah. I use some of your kines
in "Heat Wave," too.

28:21.581 --> 28:23.363
Which you'd know
if you'd read it.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.129
I read it.

28:24.359 --> 28:27.248
I thought it was terrific,
especially that sex scene.

28:27.249 --> 28:28.249
Talk about racy.

28:28.778 --> 28:30.510
Wait. There' a sex scene
in the book?

28:30.811 --> 28:31.711
Between us?

28:31.940 --> 28:34.000
There's a sex scene in
the book between Nikki Heat

28:34.010 --> 28:36.161
and the roguishly handsome
reporter who's helping her.

28:36.191 --> 28:38.500
Oh, good.
So he's nothing like you.

28:38.530 --> 28:39.549
Funny.

28:39.579 --> 28:42.361
Wait, how did--How did you
get a copy of the book?

28:43.849 --> 28:46.047
Look...Can you just tell us
that Fletcher wasn't a spook

28:46.077 --> 28:48.637
so wee can get on
with the case?

28:49.080 --> 28:50.095
Not here.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.219
Get out.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.915
Officially, I am not
at liberty to confirm or deny

29:06.925 --> 29:08.479
whether anyone is an agent,

29:08.780 --> 29:10.380
but unofficially...

29:13.367 --> 29:15.456
We've never heard
of your boy.

29:22.580 --> 29:23.975
(whispers) - So cool.
- Wh--

29:25.114 --> 29:26.816
<i>I can't believe
Fletcher conned me.</i>

29:26.846 --> 29:28.648
We need to take
another run at Elise,

29:28.678 --> 29:31.033
see if there's anything else
she's holding out on us.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.068
Dad!

29:33.151 --> 29:34.528
We need to talk.

29:37.462 --> 29:39.161
- Sweetie...
- Sit.

29:41.355 --> 29:41.987
Dylan called.

29:42.288 --> 29:44.688
Did you call Juilliard
and check on him?

29:45.457 --> 29:46.563
Maybe.

29:46.593 --> 29:48.446
I can't believe you.
After I told you.

29:48.476 --> 29:50.312
how much taking lessons
from him means to me?

29:50.322 --> 29:51.678
- Sweetie--
- No, no, quiet.

29:51.688 --> 29:53.244
Am I a troublemaker, Dad?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.228
Do I get drunk,

29:54.629 --> 29:56.629
disobey authority,
steal police horses...

29:56.630 --> 29:57.630
- That--
- Naked?

29:57.858 --> 29:59.430
No, That's be you.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.278
I seem to be the only person
in this family

30:01.279 --> 30:02.379
blessed with good judgement,

30:02.408 --> 30:04.085
And yet,
you don't trust me.

30:04.115 --> 30:07.417
I trust you. It's just--it's
a dangerous world out there...

30:07.447 --> 30:08.423
(whispers)
and people lie.

30:08.424 --> 30:11.124
You don't think I know that?
I'm in high school.

30:11.253 --> 30:13.128
it's like the wild wild west
with hormones, and I think

30:13.158 --> 30:14.516
I'm doing a pretty good job
navigating it.

30:14.517 --> 30:15.617
You are, and I'm proud.

30:15.618 --> 30:17.318
Well, then why don't you
trust me to pick the person

30:17.319 --> 30:18.919
Who's gonna inspire me
as an artist?

30:21.446 --> 30:24.328
I love you, daddy, but I'm not
a little girl anymore.

30:24.338 --> 30:26.349
You can't protect me
from everything.

30:34.024 --> 30:35.026
She's good.

30:36.286 --> 30:38.163
She took you apart
like a pro.

30:38.173 --> 30:40.597
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm. Through the glass.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.338
It was actually kind of
difficult to watch.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.869
Even harder to experience.

30:48.001 --> 30:50.936
So do you need a minute,
or can we get back to work?

30:51.511 --> 30:52.893
I'll give you a minute.

30:56.536 --> 30:58.470
You're the one who's been
pushing her to break the rules,

30:58.480 --> 31:01.480
<i>and when she suddenly steps
outside of your comfort zone,</i>

31:01.481 --> 31:01.581
(rings doorbell)

31:01.610 --> 31:03.533
I didn't freak out.
I was...

31:04.639 --> 31:06.619
I freaked out a little,
didn't I?

31:06.629 --> 31:09.405
Welcome to parenting
a teenage girl.

31:09.415 --> 31:12.911
as someone who used to be one,
you have my sympathy.

31:13.631 --> 31:14.699
Detective...

31:15.997 --> 31:17.370
Can we come in?

31:18.498 --> 31:19.586
Sure.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.654
Is everything okay?

31:28.877 --> 31:29.905
Fine.

31:30.269 --> 31:33.624
We did some checking, Elise.
Fletcher wasn't in the CIA.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.395
Okay. I-Is that all?

31:36.485 --> 31:37.203
I don't understand.

31:37.204 --> 31:39.404
You fight me tooth and nail
that he wasn't a con man,

31:39.413 --> 31:40.540
and now you just give in?

31:40.875 --> 31:43.774
I just--I just want
this whole thing behind me.

31:44.291 --> 31:45.702
There's something
you aren't telling us.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.755
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:47.765 --> 31:49.542
Elise, tell them
the good news.

31:49.577 --> 31:51.096
- What good news?
- Nothing.

31:51.131 --> 31:52.481
Fletcher alive.

31:53.909 --> 31:55.968
(whispers)
Best case ever.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.000
I'm sorry
I tried to fool you.

32:01.001 --> 32:01.701
It's just...(sighs)

32:02.035 --> 32:05.144
Steven left me a voice mail
a half an hour ago.

32:05.379 --> 32:06.729
And you're sure
it was him?

32:07.577 --> 32:09.070
<i>Elise,
they're after me.</i>

32:09.071 --> 32:11.071
<i>I'll contact you
when I can.</i>

32:11.362 --> 32:13.012
<i> Trust no one.
(cell phone beeps)</i>

32:13.487 --> 32:15.558
Okay, I just got
a chill.

32:18.729 --> 32:19.578
(whispers)
That's not possible.

32:20.279 --> 32:21.279
(whispers)
and yet...

32:22.942 --> 32:23.886
But if Fletcher's alive,

32:23.887 --> 32:26.187
then who's the dead guy
in out morgue?

32:30.332 --> 32:31.875
It's Fletcher, right?

32:32.020 --> 32:35.020
Honestly,
I'm not 100% sure.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.684
His prints match the ones
found at the apartment,

32:37.694 --> 32:40.389
but we never got a fingerprint
match on his real identity.

32:40.399 --> 32:42.362
So I have nothing else
to compare it to.

32:42.372 --> 32:45.525
Plus, Fletcher has seven known
identities, and so far,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.721
I haven't found a single one
that went to the dentist.

32:47.756 --> 32:49.805
So I have no dental records
to compare.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.677
Okay, bottom line?

32:50.878 --> 32:53.278
This body could
or could not be

32:53.287 --> 32:55.411
a man whose alias
is Steven Fletcher.

32:55.546 --> 32:58.146
- But we saw him die.
- Or did we?

33:00.279 --> 33:03.267
<i>- I hate this case/
- I know, isn't it great?</i>

33:04.431 --> 33:07.131
<i>Wait. What are you...No.
No. No, don't. Don'! Don't!</i>

33:07.332 --> 33:08.132
(gunshot)
Aah!

33:09.149 --> 33:10.351
We don't actually see
his murder.

33:10.361 --> 33:12.168
The camera's already fallen
when the shot went off.

33:12.178 --> 33:14.210
And the body we have
doesn't even have a face.

33:14.745 --> 33:18.505
But why? Fletcher was about to marry
into an obscene amount of money,

33:18.515 --> 33:20.923
and the only other scam
he had going was at the school.

33:20.933 --> 33:23.122
Why would he just jump ship
and fake his death?

33:23.157 --> 33:25.656
It's possible agent Gray
was lying to us about Fletcher

33:25.657 --> 33:26.557
to protect the mission.

33:26.691 --> 33:27.900
No, he wasn't in the CIA

33:27.901 --> 33:30.201
the paper trail for the cons
is way too extensive.

33:30.202 --> 33:30.702
(cell phone ringing)

33:30.735 --> 33:32.111
There's something else
that we're not seeing here.

33:32.112 --> 33:32.912
Yeah.

33:33.146 --> 33:34.645
Yeah, one of Fletcher's
credit cards was just used

33:34.680 --> 33:37.574
to buy a plane ticket--
JFK to Jakarta, Indonesia.

33:37.575 --> 33:38.475
He's making a run for it.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.074
- Why Indonesia?

33:39.175 --> 33:40.475
it's a nonextradition country.

33:40.684 --> 33:42.876
- What time does the plane leave?
- 5:00 o'clock.

33:44.318 --> 33:45.992
Alert D.H.S. and T.S.A.

33:46.093 --> 33:47.493
We'll cordinate a plan
of attack on the way.

33:47.602 --> 33:49.071
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

33:49.106 --> 33:50.715
We also got hits
on five other identites--

33:50.725 --> 33:52.339
credit card reservation
for flights out of Newark

33:52.340 --> 33:54.340
and LaGuardia, car rental
reservations out of New York

33:54.349 --> 33:56.343
and Philadelphia
and an Amtrak out of D.C.

33:56.478 --> 33:58.438
He's trying to confuse
his trail, spread us thin.

33:58.448 --> 33:59.018
Well, it's gonna work.

33:59.019 --> 34:01.019
We don't have resources
to cover that territory.

34:01.253 --> 34:02.567
And these are just the ID's
that we know about.

34:02.702 --> 34:04.117
I guarantee you he's got
at least one identity

34:04.118 --> 34:05.218
we've never heard of.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.702
So he's gonna get away
with this murder?

34:07.362 --> 34:08.649
- No.
- What do you mean, "No"?

34:08.684 --> 34:10.275
By the time we figure out
his real escape route,

34:10.275 --> 34:12.376
He'll be on a beach somewhere
laughing at us.

34:12.409 --> 34:14.063
We don't need to figure out
his escape route,

34:14.063 --> 34:16.464
Because all roads lead
to Elise.

34:17.654 --> 34:20.692
Why would he risk everything
by calling Elise?

34:21.224 --> 34:22.708
Sir, I believe
he really does love her,

34:22.710 --> 34:24.610
and he was planning on
running away with her.

34:24.944 --> 34:27.192
If we get to Elise,
we'll find Fletcher.

34:27.226 --> 34:28.243
Go.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.592
You just missed her.

34:30.594 --> 34:33.793
She left about ten minutes ago
after she got another call.

34:33.928 --> 34:34.601
From Fletcher?

34:34.803 --> 34:37.103
She wouldn't say.
She just ran out the door.

34:37.337 --> 34:39.295
But I think she might have
written something down

34:39.297 --> 34:39.996
by the phone?

34:42.603 --> 34:43.728
What's going on?

34:43.763 --> 34:44.962
Try the old pencil trick
where

34:44.963 --> 34:45.862
<i>- I know.
- you rub it--</i>

34:49.960 --> 34:51.061
Damn it.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.167
I'm gonna call in
an A.P.B. on Elise,

34:54.202 --> 34:57.009
see if we can get lucky
at one of the airports.

34:58.531 --> 34:59.623
or...

35:03.919 --> 35:04.919
What?

35:05.701 --> 35:08.131
- Mrs. Finnegan, What is this?
- Oh, oh.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.318
that's their
engagement albumn.

35:10.627 --> 35:12.061
it just came.

35:12.071 --> 35:13.396
Sue made it for the wedding.

35:13.397 --> 35:15.597
Every guest
was going to get one.

35:15.631 --> 35:16.466
This looks just like the--

35:16.467 --> 35:18.367
The Artic brochure
Fletcher handed out.

35:18.376 --> 35:19.852
You said Sue made this?

35:19.887 --> 35:21.437
Yes,
she's a graphic artist.

35:21.664 --> 35:23.170
How long has
Sue known Elise?

35:23.205 --> 35:24.955
Oh, I don't know.
A year, maybe.

35:25.268 --> 35:26.781
Sue is Fletcher's partner.

35:26.816 --> 35:28.531
It's the
undercover lover con.

35:28.766 --> 35:31.420
Sue is the scout.
She gets close to Elise first,

35:31.430 --> 35:32.586
learns everything
there is to know,

35:32.587 --> 35:33.987
paving the way
for Fletcher.

35:33.996 --> 35:34.948
Who comes in
with a playbook

35:34.949 --> 35:37.049
of all of Elise's
hopes and dreams,

35:37.050 --> 35:39.550
and voilà,
it's love at first sight.

35:39.913 --> 35:42.159
Oh, no, no, no.
Something doesn't quite track.

35:42.169 --> 35:44.731
Why would they fake Fletcher's
death in such a public way?

35:44.741 --> 35:46.659
They had to know the police
were gonna get involved,

35:46.669 --> 35:48.791
exposing their con to a lot
of dangerous scrutiny.

35:48.801 --> 35:50.842
Unless Fletcher
really is dead.

35:50.852 --> 35:51.931
If her dad is right,

35:51.932 --> 35:53.932
and Fletcher really
fell in love with Elise...

35:53.966 --> 35:55.894
And was going to give up
his con man ways...

35:55.929 --> 35:58.235
Then Sue stood to lose a fortune
by not finishing the con,

35:58.245 --> 36:00.322
and if Fletcher married Elise,
then Sue had no chance

36:00.323 --> 36:01.423
of pulling off the con
on her own.

36:01.457 --> 36:03.090
So Sue takes matters
into her own hands,

36:03.091 --> 36:05.091
she kills Fletcher,
shooting him in the face,

36:05.100 --> 36:06.907
making sure a positive I.D.
is impossible.

36:06.917 --> 36:07.279
Bingo.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.880
But what about the
phone call from Steven?

36:11.139 --> 36:12.210
Well, she must have
faked it somehow.

36:12.511 --> 36:13.811
Why?

36:14.145 --> 36:15.341
Because...

36:15.567 --> 36:17.354
- The con is still on.
- The con is still on.

36:17.389 --> 36:18.750
If Elise needed money
where would she go?

36:18.951 --> 36:21.751
National Bank and Trust.
84th and Lexington.

36:22.039 --> 36:24.910
- Thank you Mrs. Finnegan.
- Save these, they're evidence.

36:26.644 --> 36:27.675
Sue.

36:28.199 --> 36:29.409
Is Steven okay?

36:29.419 --> 36:31.811
Yeah, yeah. He would've called
himself, but it wasn't safe.

36:31.846 --> 36:34.079
and-and he's sure that
a million's going to be enough?

36:34.089 --> 36:35.486
it's enough to get you
out of the country.

36:35.487 --> 36:36.987
He's got money
stashed overseas.

36:36.996 --> 36:38.418
Oh, thanks, Sue.

36:38.453 --> 36:40.304
- You need to hurry.
- Okay (chuckles).

36:50.976 --> 36:52.477
- Any problems?
- No, no.

36:52.487 --> 36:53.847
(man) Ms. Finnegan!

36:56.875 --> 36:59.349
- You forgot your phone.
- Oh, thank you.

36:59.359 --> 37:00.542
Your welcome.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.286
Steven just called.

37:03.296 --> 37:05.038
He wants me to drop the money
at the safe house,

37:05.039 --> 37:06.339
while you go pack.

37:06.348 --> 37:08.083
He said to meet him
at Grand Central at 9:00

37:08.084 --> 37:09.584
after he does
one last thing.

37:09.793 --> 37:11.389
- And then you two
can be together.

37:11.390 --> 37:12.290
Here.

37:13.074 --> 37:14.773
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

37:32.395 --> 37:33.195
Newspapers

37:33.596 --> 37:35.596
I didn't think people
read those anymore.

37:35.597 --> 37:39.597
(sirens wailing)

37:43.699 --> 37:44.895
Outta the car, you.

37:45.223 --> 37:46.734
Come on,
Let me see your hands.

37:46.924 --> 37:47.935
Turn around.

37:48.662 --> 37:49.746
You know,
Detective Beckett here

37:49.747 --> 37:52.047
didn't think we could con
a con artist, but

37:52.081 --> 37:53.732
I told her
you just weren't that smart.

37:54.067 --> 37:56.040
You did, after all, fall for
the oldest con in the book--

37:56.775 --> 37:58.102
The lazy susan.

38:00.916 --> 38:02.725
The lazy susan?

38:02.735 --> 38:04.111
It's either that
or the grumpy beaver.

38:04.112 --> 38:05.212
I always get
them mixed up.

38:05.221 --> 38:06.236
Detective.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.867
Thank you so much
for your help.

38:10.877 --> 38:11.881
Absolutely

38:12.222 --> 38:13.722
It's my job
to protect our clients.

38:14.623 --> 38:15.923
Hey.
(laughs)

38:16.163 --> 38:17.471
Oh, wow. Whoa.
Hang on a second.

38:17.472 --> 38:19.872
I thought you said
you hated con movies.

38:20.106 --> 38:23.657
Oh, Castle, you are such
an easy mark, aren't ya?

38:23.692 --> 38:25.473
Hey, I got something.

38:29.068 --> 38:31.002
<i>Elise,
they're after me.</i>

38:31.432 --> 38:34.543
<i>I'll contact you
when I can. Trust no one.</i>

38:34.575 --> 38:37.725
When you see how it's done,
it really takes the magic out of it.

38:37.770 --> 38:38.785
Detective?

38:42.261 --> 38:43.961
Is Steven really dead?

38:45.889 --> 38:46.989
I'm afraid so.

38:49.115 --> 38:51.139
(voice breaks)
Then it was all a lie?

38:52.296 --> 38:52.774
No, Elise.

38:52.775 --> 38:55.675
You need to know that Steven
loved you very much.

38:56.687 --> 39:01.137
He changed his ways because you
made him want to be a better man.

39:03.136 --> 39:04.147
Thank you.

39:14.705 --> 39:16.190
No hot date tonight?

39:16.225 --> 39:17.954
No, Just the paperwork.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.275
One of the many reasons I'm glad
I'm not actually a cop.

39:20.276 --> 39:21.276
Uh-huh.

39:21.510 --> 39:23.779
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, you, too.

39:52.180 --> 39:52.880
Aha.

39:52.942 --> 39:54.757
Oh!. (whispers) Castle,
What are you doing here?

39:54.792 --> 39:57.412
- I knew you were reading it.
- Uh, I w--

39:57.447 --> 40:00.569
- It's one page 105, by the way.
- What?

40:00.579 --> 40:02.338
That sex scene
you're looking for.

40:02.439 --> 40:04.839
And Agent Gray was right.
It's steamy.

40:05.473 --> 40:06.132
I wasn't.

40:06.242 --> 40:07.046
See you tomorrow

40:08.047 --> 40:08.747
(gasps)

40:08.748 --> 40:09.748
(whistles)

40:11.749 --> 40:12.749
(door opens)

40:13.150 --> 40:13.950
(exhales)

40:14.351 --> 40:15.251
Oh.

40:16.252 --> 40:17.052
(door closes)

40:26.653 --> 40:32.353
("Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"
playing out-of-tune on violin)

40:36.130 --> 40:37.995
Wait.
Who's getting a lesson?

40:38.030 --> 40:39.045
Gram.

40:39.143 --> 40:41.643
- (Dylan) Very good. Very good.
- Thank you.

40:42.042 --> 40:43.784
- That's nice
- Yeah.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.750
- Very nice
- Yeah

40:55.171 --> 40:57.671
Yeah, Oh, I-It's--Yes.

40:57.911 --> 41:00.415
I'm sorry for how I acted.

41:00.983 --> 41:03.614
There's no one in the world
I trust more than I trust you.

41:05.015 --> 41:06.515
And I'm gonna try
to be more respectful.

41:07.864 --> 41:09.645
Just promise me one thing.

41:12.586 --> 41:14.162
Be patient with me.

41:14.440 --> 41:17.172
I've never had
a teenage daughter before.

41:19.288 --> 41:20.319
Deal

41:20.571 --> 41:21.573
Thanks.

41:28.993 --> 41:32.452
Aren't you worried about Dylan's
intensions towards Gram?

41:32.487 --> 41:34.539
I'm hoping they involve
running away together,

41:34.540 --> 41:35.840
but I'm not that lucky.

41:35.841 --> 41:36.841
(Dylan) It's getting better.

41:38.098 --> 41:40.892
Speaking of running away,
how about we have dinner out?

41:40.927 --> 41:42.671
- Yes, please.
- Thank yo.

41:42.706 --> 41:44.455
(Dylan) Really keep
that wrist relaxed.

41:44.552 --> 41:45.739
Good, good.

41:45.825 --> 41:46.856
Come on.
