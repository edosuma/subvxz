00:01.502 --> 00:03.204
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.237 --> 00:07.875
Now remember, big brothers look
out for their little brothers.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.843
It's their only job.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.382
I want to enlist, Doc.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.016
I need to be there with him.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.585
Hey, little brother.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.491
BETH: I have known her
all of her life.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.659
Her background is complicated.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.695
She will break you, Kevin.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.197
KEVIN:
That is a visa application

00:29.230 --> 00:30.498
for a trip to Vietnam.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.266
I'm gonna go to the place
where my dad last served.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.501
I'm gonna track down that woman,

00:33.534 --> 00:34.902
and I'm gonna figure out
my dad's story.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.204
Vietnam, huh?

00:36.237 --> 00:37.238
-Yeah.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.239
Yeah, all right.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.341
Do you want to go on a drive?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.442
Where do you want to go?

00:41.475 --> 00:44.011
Los Angeles.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.913
-Yeah.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.981
Yeah, let's go to Los Angeles.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.003
*

01:27.488 --> 01:29.990
Hi. Uh, could I get a look
at that one?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.927
Shiny. Girls like shiny, right?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.815
PILOT :
Preparing for landing

02:27.848 --> 02:29.817
at Tân Son Nhat
International Airport.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.187
*

02:45.065 --> 02:47.501
Jack.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.136
Is that really you?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.539
Yeah, it's really me.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.080
If you die out here,
that's not on me.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.517
It's okay.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.152
-It's okay.
-Don't, no.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.788
Don't touch me.
Don't look at me.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.060
You're not here. I'm not here.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.095
I'm not even here.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.865
What are you on, Nick?

03:33.981 --> 03:35.583
I'm gonna get you out of here.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.518
-Yeah.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.886
:
How?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.122
I'll figure something out.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.692
Oh, yeah?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.227
Why, do you got a plan, Jack?

03:47.261 --> 03:50.130
I got charged with Article 15.
That's unbecoming conduct.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.301
I'll figure something out.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.135
Jesus Christ.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.875
You know...

04:01.909 --> 04:03.777
it was just a nickname, man.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.116
You're not Superman.

04:09.149 --> 04:13.587
It's just a... stupid nickname.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.104
* Sitting in a park
in Paris, France *

04:31.138 --> 04:32.940
* Reading the news
and it sure looks bad *

04:32.973 --> 04:36.009
-* They won't give
peace a chance *

04:36.043 --> 04:38.646
* That was just a dream
some of us had... *

04:38.679 --> 04:41.749
Well, we're officially
out of Pittsburgh.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.485
Only 2,423 more miles
till we get to Los Angeles.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.821
-So almost there.
-Yeah, exactly.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.258
* I'll even kiss a sunset pig

04:51.291 --> 04:53.527
* California,
I'm coming home... *

04:53.561 --> 04:56.664
My mom says I'm nuts for doing
this with a guy I barely know.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.599
We've known each other
a whole week.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.603
* Who did the goat dance
very well *

05:02.636 --> 05:06.006
* He gave me back my smile, but
he kept my camera to sell... *

05:06.039 --> 05:07.541
The record label that
I'm meeting with out in L.A.?

05:07.575 --> 05:09.643
-Mm-hmm. -They actually
released this album.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.978
-Mm-hmm.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.980
-* Stayed on with him there

05:13.013 --> 05:15.182
* But my heart cried
out for you... *

05:15.215 --> 05:17.050
They'd be lucky to have you.
I mean...

05:17.084 --> 05:18.652
This woman's got nothing on you.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.889
D... "This woman"
is Joni Mitchell,

05:21.922 --> 05:24.057
and she runs circles around me.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.996
-I don't think so.
-Um, she does.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.034
Oh, I can't wait to get to L.A.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.536
Sunset Boulevard.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.170
The Pacific Ocean.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.205
-Mm.
-Mm.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.741
See, I love being
from Pittsburgh,

05:40.774 --> 05:43.577
but sometimes it just feels

05:43.611 --> 05:45.846
a little small.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.081
-Yeah.
-* All the news of home...

05:50.618 --> 05:52.686
Oh, my friend, Nicole,
says that we can stay with her

05:52.720 --> 05:54.988
-as long as we need to.
-Sounds good.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.891
* Bought me a ticket,
I got on a plane to Spain *

05:57.925 --> 06:00.193
* Went to a party
down a red dirt road... *

06:00.227 --> 06:02.930
Is there anything that you want
to do in particular

06:02.963 --> 06:04.231
when you're out in L.A.?

06:04.264 --> 06:08.068
I want to go see some folks
I know in Reseda.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.202
Oh.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.038
Friends of yours or...?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.441
Yeah, sort of.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.077
* Oh, will you
take me as I am? *

06:17.110 --> 06:18.879
* Strung out on another man...

06:18.912 --> 06:20.213
I made some turkey sandwiches.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.882
I don't know if you're
a turkey fan, but...

06:21.915 --> 06:23.250
I love turkey.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.785
Ah, me, too.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.788
Look at us--
couple of turkey freaks.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.190
-Driving across the country.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.860
And my mom said it was too soon
to take a road trip.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.794
Yeah?

06:37.598 --> 06:41.569
* Take me as I am.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.579
I can't believe
we're in Vietnam.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.448
It's amazing.
I wonder if my dad actually

06:54.482 --> 06:57.050
flew in here before
he was stationed, you know?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.786
It's like I already kind of feel

06:58.819 --> 07:00.220
connected to him
just being here.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.824
Hey, when do we get
to my dad's fishing village?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.659
-Monday.
-Awesome.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.461
Hey.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.096
Say "Vietna-cheese."

07:09.129 --> 07:10.831
I just made that up.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.433
I'm sure. Just don't tag me
on Instagram.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.635
Really?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.904
I thought we graduated
to "tagging" status.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.071
It's not that.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.209
I just don't want my dad
to know I'm in Vietnam.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.646
I'm gonna need more words.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.681
My father lives in China.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.618
If he sees I'm in Vietnam, he'll
try and reach out and see me.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.620
Don't want to see him.

07:32.653 --> 07:37.324
-Yeah.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.459
You literally never
mentioned that before.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.595
Or-or really anything
about your family.

07:41.629 --> 07:45.533
Well... Hey, I found us
this great market for lunch.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.167
Best bánh bèo in town.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.505
It's like eating the ocean.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.207
Okay. Yeah, no. Looks great.

07:54.241 --> 07:58.812
Let's, uh, let the greatest trip
of all time begin.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.490
Major Dawson?

08:10.524 --> 08:14.027
-I'm Jack Pearson.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.730
-Nicky Pearson's brother.

08:16.764 --> 08:21.368
I'm a staff sergeant down
a ville on the Sông Trà Khúc.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.303
Came here for my brother.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.372
I was hoping
to take him back with me.

08:25.405 --> 08:29.009
-Get his ass squared away.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.211
That kid hasn't been
"squared away" for months.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.481
Insubordination,
partying like it's Woodstock.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.149
That's why I got him
on doo-doo detail.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.185
I can get him right, sir.
I know I can.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.519
Why's that, Pearson?

08:39.553 --> 08:40.921
'Cause you're his brother?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.890
'Cause you used to share
a room?

08:42.923 --> 08:45.192
Used to whisper ghost stories
to each other in the dark?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.760
He's not cut out for this.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.195
That's why I'm here.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.098
Well, you're too late.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.340
You know, we did
used to share a room.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.444
Drafty old house,
a lot of spiders, big spiders.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.446
Spiders so big,

09:06.479 --> 09:09.516
you could see their knees.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.118
My father saw one of them,

09:11.151 --> 09:13.587
he'd take the nearest
rolled-up newspaper,

09:13.621 --> 09:15.589
smash the hell out of it.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.792
You know what Nicky would do
when he saw a spider?

09:18.826 --> 09:22.429
He'd go to the kitchen,
he'd get himself a glass,

09:22.462 --> 09:24.264
grab a comic book,

09:24.297 --> 09:26.099
and then carefully,
so carefully,

09:26.133 --> 09:28.268
he would guide the spider
onto the book,

09:28.301 --> 09:31.639
trap it under the glass
and then take it outside,

09:31.672 --> 09:34.742
so it could crawl away.

09:34.775 --> 09:39.279
That was his favorite part,
watching it be okay.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.318
I need to try and save
my little brother

09:45.352 --> 09:47.621
before 'Nam eats him alive.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.757
Sir, please.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.424
We don't put brothers
in the same outfit.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.493
That's basic policy.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.262
I mean, who wants to write
two condolence letters

09:55.295 --> 09:56.596
to the same mother?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.266
Now I suggest you make your way
back to your ville.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.600
Guess you're walking.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.003
V.C. owns the road at night.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.304
You better move out.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.777
Sir.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.868
Thank you.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.870
Chicken. Bat.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.605
KEVIN:
Great. Appreciate it.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.207
I wonder what "bat" means
in English.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.374
It means bat.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.943
Hmm?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.045
Really? You're just gonna sit
there and casually eat a bat?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.380
I like to immerse myself
when I travel.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.016
-No. No, I do not.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.650
No way. No way in hell.
You enjoy.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.352
-Coward.
-Well, I'm sorry

10:52.385 --> 10:54.187
my taste buds aren't
eclectic like yours.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.957
We were more of a, like, a beige
food fam growing up, you know?

10:56.990 --> 11:00.227
A lot of chicken nuggets,
lot of mac and cheese.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.495
Want to get wild, we'd go,
like, chicken potpie

11:02.529 --> 11:04.331
every once in a while.
What about you?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.399
What about me?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.636
Well, you know, what was dinner
like when you were a kid?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.372
For you. I mean, I know you
moved in with Beth's family

11:12.405 --> 11:14.574
when you were eight,
I know that, but before that.

11:14.607 --> 11:18.578
I don't know. Dinner's dinner.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.881
-Right. Got it.
-Oh, God.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.682
Please tell me we don't look
that touristy.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.992
Excuse me. Excu...

11:32.025 --> 11:34.527
Excuse me. Hi.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.063
Your necklace, I-- uh,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.497
uh, do you mind telling me
where you got that?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.767
Souvenir shop, at the entrance.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.435
Here.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.293
Can I ask you a question.
Do you sell a lot of these?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.931
Sell many, many, many.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.344
"I Fall to Pieces"
by Patsy Cline plays)

12:33.020 --> 12:35.422
JACK: So how did you
get this meeting?

12:35.455 --> 12:36.790
With the record company?

12:36.824 --> 12:40.427
My friend Nicole got my demo
to an assistant,

12:40.460 --> 12:43.130
and then the assistant
got it to an A&R guy there.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.165
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.134
And what happens when they fall
in love with you?

12:47.167 --> 12:50.470
-Which they will.

12:50.503 --> 12:54.674
I think I make a more
professional-sounding demo.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.477
And then, if by some miracle,
that goes well,

12:57.510 --> 13:00.513
I make a full album.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.284
And then, if we're really
getting into fantasyland, I...

13:06.119 --> 13:09.156
...I open up for Neil Young.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.591
Mm. And then I'm just
on the road.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.126
Is that what you want?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.262
I don't know.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.998
-Hmm.
-I just love watching people
dance while I sing.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.835
People don't slow dance nearly
as much as they should.

13:24.972 --> 13:28.808
And I... love doing
my small part

13:28.842 --> 13:31.478
to keep it alive.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.814
Hint taken.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.816
("Lonely Comin' Down"
by Dolly Parton playing)

13:36.850 --> 13:38.618
Oh.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.553
:
Okay.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.027
* I woke up

13:47.060 --> 13:49.963
* This morning

13:49.997 --> 13:54.167
* In a strange place

13:54.201 --> 13:56.569
-Ooh.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.704
* I looked into...

13:57.737 --> 13:59.873
Where did you get those moves?

13:59.907 --> 14:03.010
Well, it wasn't Christmas in my
house until my mom got to dance

14:03.043 --> 14:05.145
-to Frank Sinatra's
Christmas record.
-Mm-hmm.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.815
My dad, he didn't
like to dance with her.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.651
So I, I might have picked up
a move or two.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.654
Hmm.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.857
* But you could
not be found... *

14:17.891 --> 14:20.860
:
Look how sweet they are.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.932
Sorry, I'm kind of an easy cry.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.566
That's okay.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.601
I mean, I usually make it
past the third date.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.940
What about you

14:32.973 --> 14:35.575
Nope. Never.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.344
Never?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.346
-Mm-mmm.
-Like,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.449
not even at the end
of Old Yeller?

14:42.482 --> 14:45.052
No, I...

14:45.085 --> 14:49.222
I've gotten really good at just
swallowing the bad stuff.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.795
This is nice.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.231
You know,
it's like I always say.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.468
People don't slow dance nearly
as much as they should.

15:01.501 --> 15:07.040
* I woke up this morning

15:07.074 --> 15:11.644
* In a strange place...

15:11.678 --> 15:13.646
-Yeah, that's...
-Yeah, exactly.

15:13.680 --> 15:19.086
* I looked into the mirror...

15:19.119 --> 15:20.887
Did you want to use
the sink first?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.456
-To, uh, brush your teeth, or...

15:23.490 --> 15:25.825
Oh, yeah. Okay.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.627
* Then I looked

15:27.660 --> 15:30.930
* For you

15:30.964 --> 15:34.167
* But you could not

15:34.201 --> 15:38.005
* Be found

15:38.038 --> 15:42.309
* And then I felt the lonely

15:42.342 --> 15:47.280
* Coming down...

15:47.314 --> 15:49.849
You know, I think my grandfather
had those pajamas.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.652
Be quiet. I like to be toasty
when I sleep.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.325
* To the empty bed

16:01.028 --> 16:03.997
* Saw the imprint

16:04.031 --> 16:06.166
* On the pillow

16:06.199 --> 16:10.970
* Where you laid your head

16:13.073 --> 16:15.275
* The presence of you...

16:15.308 --> 16:19.946
Three dates, three kisses.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.615
Three amazing kisses.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.617
* Around

16:24.651 --> 16:27.020
* And once again

16:27.054 --> 16:29.389
* I felt the lonely

16:29.422 --> 16:33.993
* Coming down

16:36.096 --> 16:40.967
* Then I felt the lonely

16:41.000 --> 16:45.405
* Dripping down

16:45.438 --> 16:47.840
* My face

16:47.874 --> 16:52.179
* As I realized

16:52.212 --> 16:56.849
* No one could take your place

16:59.352 --> 17:04.991
* And then again,
I felt the lonely *

17:05.024 --> 17:06.359
* Coming down

17:10.863 --> 17:14.634
* Hmm, hmm...

17:25.078 --> 17:26.446
REBECCA:
Hey.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.014
Hey, Jack.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.617
Hey, Jack, Jack. Hey, Jack.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.019
You okay?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.422
Yeah.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.390
I'm okay.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.595
*

18:09.289 --> 18:12.058
Have you been having
a lot of bad dreams

18:12.091 --> 18:14.794
since you got back from Vietnam?

18:14.827 --> 18:19.065
You know, I don't really
remember my dreams much, so...

18:19.098 --> 18:22.335
Okay.

18:22.369 --> 18:26.273
But maybe, you're having these
nightmares because you...

18:26.306 --> 18:27.907
Rebecca.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.843
-Please.
-Sorry.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.320
It's okay.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.065
*

19:09.749 --> 19:11.818
Hello. Hi.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.020
I'm trying to get to the river.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.657
-Sông Trà Khúc.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.794
Yeah. Yeah, the, uh,
fishing-fishing ville.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
Y-You know the fishing ville--
you take me there?

19:31.037 --> 19:33.005
I'm Jack.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.507
Jack.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.209
-Bao.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.877
Bao.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.979
Nice to meet you, Bao.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.383
-No. No walk.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.052
No drive. My ride left, I...

19:46.085 --> 19:47.887
You can take me.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.358
Yeah?

19:53.593 --> 19:55.127
Of course.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.602
("Stay With Me"
by Faces playing)

20:21.988 --> 20:24.424
You are gonna love Nicole.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.426
She moved from Pittsburgh
to be an actress.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.261
-Uh-huh.
-She just did
a paper towel commercial.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.796
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

20:29.829 --> 20:34.434
* In the morning,
don't say you love me *

20:34.467 --> 20:39.372
* 'Cause I'll only kick you out
of the door *

20:39.406 --> 20:42.575
* I know your name is Rita

20:42.609 --> 20:45.712
* 'Cause your perfume
smelling sweeter *

20:45.745 --> 20:49.749
* Since when I saw you down
on the floor *

20:49.782 --> 20:51.751
* Guitar...

20:51.784 --> 20:53.386
NICOLE:
Oh, Becky!

20:53.420 --> 20:55.221
-Becky.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.424
She is the only one
allowed to call me that.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.326
Don't get any ideas. Oh...

21:03.095 --> 21:04.464
Oh, is this him?

21:04.497 --> 21:06.899
Uh, this is, uh, Jack.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.901
Hey. Thanks for having us.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.137
This place is amazing.
You live here?

21:11.170 --> 21:14.173
I'm staying here while Greg's
on location in Canada.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.776
Greg Billagio.
He's an up-and-coming director,

21:16.809 --> 21:19.111
-and my occasional sweetheart.
-Oh.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.513
-Oh, drinks.
You guys need drinks.
-Yes.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.782
I'll get them.
Let you two catch up.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.984
-Thank you.
-Oh, he's a gentleman.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.853
-Okay, tell me about your Jack.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.523
I don't even know what to say.
It's still so new.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.292
So, we've been traveling
together for a few days now,

21:33.326 --> 21:37.464
and I just, I feel like I don't
know any more about him

21:37.497 --> 21:39.499
than when we first started.

21:39.532 --> 21:43.135
Like, he's going to visit
someone in Reseda tomorrow,

21:43.169 --> 21:45.672
-and he won't tell me who it is.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.840
No, no, no, no, no.
Not like that.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.478
It's just, he, um...
he just got back from Vietnam,

21:51.511 --> 21:53.813
so he's clearly working through
some things,

21:53.846 --> 21:55.515
but he won't talk to me
about it.

21:55.548 --> 21:59.786
I just... ugh,
I wish he would let me

21:59.819 --> 22:01.854
be in it with him.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.625
You're really wild
about this guy, huh, Becky?

22:05.658 --> 22:10.597
Yeah. I just...
I want to be wherever he is.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.201
I just wish he would let me in.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.140
KEVIN: I was positive that
this necklace came

22:21.173 --> 22:22.909
from that woman
in the photo, you know,

22:22.942 --> 22:25.645
that it had some epic
origin story to it.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.246
It turns out you can get it
anywhere here.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.748
-Kevin...
-Maybe Randall was right.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.349
I should've just left well
enough alone, you know.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.019
Let my father be remembered the
way he wanted to be remembered,

22:33.052 --> 22:36.022
and stop asking
so many questions.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.258
You ever go through
anything like that?

22:39.291 --> 22:42.261
Did I ever travel to Vietnam to
find out my father's war story?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.497
No. I think I would've mentioned
that uncanny coincidence to you.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.599
I think you know what I mean.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.401
Mind if we go back
to the hotel?

22:48.435 --> 22:51.370
I-I think I want to lay down.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.039
Yeah, no, let's go back
to the hotel.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.407
You can continue to tell me

22:54.441 --> 22:55.708
absolutely nothing
about your life.

22:55.742 --> 22:56.776
-That's not fair.

22:56.809 --> 22:57.877
I tell you plenty.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.278
I'm just saying, you know,

22:59.311 --> 23:00.947
you're obviously going through
something with your dad.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.717
I'm not going through
anything, Kevin.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.119
It's just a constant,
terrible part of my life

23:07.153 --> 23:08.688
that I try not to dwell on.

23:08.721 --> 23:12.625
So... can we please go back
to the hotel?

23:12.659 --> 23:14.694
I-I don't think I feel well.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.697
That's real mature.
That's great.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.335
Oh, wow.
That's a lot of bad bat.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.752
-Hey.
-Hi.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.287
-Champagne.
-Thank you.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.122
-ALL: Cheers.

23:43.155 --> 23:46.158
Mm!

23:46.192 --> 23:48.127
-It was just champagne.
-Okay.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.629
-Yeah.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.830
I'm fine.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.333
I'm fine.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.146
Bao, why are we stopping?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.684
What is this place?
Where are we, Bao?

24:14.521 --> 24:15.922
You.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.193
(indistinct chatter
in Vietnamese)

24:21.227 --> 24:23.462
Please be a good guy, Bao.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.152
What you got, Squirrel?

25:20.186 --> 25:23.623
Toe popper. Homemade.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.374
You gonna take me back
to my squad, Bao?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.699
The bathroom's down the hall,
if you need it.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.500
Okay.

26:21.413 --> 26:25.051
I can't talk about it.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.587
Vietnam.

26:28.621 --> 26:32.925
What I did and what I saw.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.864
I just, I don't...

26:40.867 --> 26:43.770
I don't want to bring that part
of my life

26:43.803 --> 26:46.673
into... this

26:46.706 --> 26:48.808
with you.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.678
Okay.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.450
Are you gonna come back
to Pittsburgh?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.892
I don't know.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.047
*

27:40.760 --> 27:43.562
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.198
Good luck with... yours, too.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.534
Thanks.

28:01.914 --> 28:06.085
REBECCA:
* Give it enough time

28:11.223 --> 28:14.727
* Just give it time.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.072
Good stuff. Great stuff.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.241
-That was beautiful.

28:29.275 --> 28:33.012
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.114
Thank you for coming in.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.518
-So...
-So keep in touch.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.588
Definitely keep us posted
on what you're up to.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.193
All right, thank you very much
for your time.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.196
Nice to meet you.
Thank you. Thanks.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.535
Um, I'm-I'm sorry.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.605
Could you actually just be
a little bit more specific

28:59.638 --> 29:01.607
with your feedback?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.275
Meaning?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.544
"Keep in touch,"
what does that look like?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.380
You let us know
if you have a show,

29:08.414 --> 29:10.216
and we will try to get
someone out to see it.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.318
And then what?

29:12.351 --> 29:15.287
And then we keep in touch.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.459
Please, I-I drove
a really long way.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.063
If you could be very clear.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.999
-Pittsburgh.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.305
I think you're Pittsburgh good.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.980
Thank you.
I appreciate the feedback.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.257
Mrs. Watterson?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.893
Yes. Can I help you?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.196
Mr. Watterson.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.168
I'm Staff Sergeant Jack Pearson.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.271
Your son was under my command.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.240
I'm responsible for his death.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.821
Bao, why

30:22.855 --> 30:25.124
Why are you stopping?
The ville is that way.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.726
You walk. You walk.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.932
You go. You walk.

30:36.402 --> 30:40.106
Are you a good guy
or a bad guy, Bao?

30:43.409 --> 30:45.511
Are you V.C.?

30:47.779 --> 30:49.281
Sometime.

31:10.903 --> 31:16.075
Everything about the war
is murky,

31:16.108 --> 31:20.146
and all my memories
are just... murky.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.750
I don't know whose idea it was

31:24.783 --> 31:30.222
to pick up the football first
that day, but knowing Squirrel--

31:30.256 --> 31:34.026
excuse me, Roger--

31:34.060 --> 31:38.931
knowing Roger,
it was probably his idea.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.735
A lot of energy, that kid.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.642
It was a quiet night.

31:50.676 --> 31:55.147
At least, we...
we thought it was.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.953
Hey, Townie, knock it off.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.554
-Oh, just one more, Sarge.
-No.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.423
-Go long, pretty boy.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.958
I don't think
you got the arm, Townie.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.226
Yeah, want to bet? Go deep.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.794
Now, for a big boy,
you sure throw

32:08.827 --> 32:09.761
-like a small...

32:14.200 --> 32:16.135
I let my guard down.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.746
I failed many times
when I was over there,

32:27.779 --> 32:33.485
but taking my eye
off your son, that...

32:33.519 --> 32:37.589
It was the worst thing I did,

32:37.623 --> 32:41.593
and I take responsibility.

32:41.627 --> 32:45.597
I take full responsibility.

32:45.631 --> 32:50.036
And I know it may not
mean much but...

32:50.069 --> 32:53.339
I needed to come here

32:53.372 --> 32:56.542
and tell you that,

32:56.575 --> 33:00.212
well, he was one
of the good ones.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.051
And that I am sorry.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.769
*

33:36.748 --> 33:40.119
It wasn't your fault, son.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.923
It wasn't.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.701
Don't say anything.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.870
It's the safest place
for me to be right now.

33:58.904 --> 34:01.807
Okay. Uh...

34:04.576 --> 34:07.746
I got you this. I can't read
the label, but, um,

34:07.779 --> 34:09.581
it's either coconut water
or suntan lotion.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.550
I'd give it a little sniff

34:11.583 --> 34:13.152
before I drank it,
if I were you.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.256
Want me to help you with that?

34:17.289 --> 34:20.226
-No, I-I can do it.
-No, you can't.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.102
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.373
Coconut water?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.608
-Suntan lotion.
-Ah.

34:37.943 --> 34:42.448
You know, my dad, um...

34:42.481 --> 34:45.917
he kept the first 28 years of
his life a secret from my mom,

34:45.951 --> 34:49.488
which worked for them, you know.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.857
I mean, it more than worked
for them, actually, but...

34:54.793 --> 34:57.329
I don't want that for us.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.398
Okay?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.932
I don't.

35:00.966 --> 35:04.970
I-I want to be able to tell you
everything and I want to know...

35:05.003 --> 35:08.207
I want to know everything
about you.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.845
But if I can't,

35:13.879 --> 35:17.816
um,

35:17.849 --> 35:19.685
it's okay.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.853
That's okay

35:21.887 --> 35:25.657
because you smell like peaches,

35:25.691 --> 35:27.826
and, well, right now
you-you don't.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.528
You smell like garbage
right now, actually,

35:29.561 --> 35:31.997
but, typically,
you smell like peaches.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.566
And you keep snacks in that
big purse that you have and...

35:40.038 --> 35:43.642
Well, I'm falling
in love with you.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.549
Whether you open up
to me or not,

35:50.582 --> 35:53.084
I'm falling in love with you.

36:03.995 --> 36:08.200
My father sexually abused me.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.479
He, uh...

36:20.512 --> 36:23.382
he tries to contact me
every so often,

36:23.415 --> 36:25.851
try and make amends,

36:25.884 --> 36:29.255
but I have no interest.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.724
I've moved on.

36:35.193 --> 36:39.365
Um, I'm not telling you this
because you asked me to,

36:39.398 --> 36:42.501
or because you told me

36:42.534 --> 36:46.405
you-you're falling
in love with me,

36:46.438 --> 36:49.375
or even because I'm falling
in love with you, too.

36:49.408 --> 36:52.177
I'm telling you this
because my father

36:52.210 --> 36:55.213
has already ruined
so much for me,

36:55.247 --> 36:58.784
and I'm not gonna let him
ruin this, too.

37:05.257 --> 37:09.895
I d-- I didn't, um...

37:09.928 --> 37:12.698
It's just you-you always seem
so strong, you know.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.965
I-I didn't, uh...

37:16.602 --> 37:20.005
I am strong.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.494
Thank you.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.064
How'd it go?

37:46.097 --> 37:50.235
Uh, it went okay.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.071
How did it go, your visit?

37:53.104 --> 37:57.543
Yeah, it went, uh,
as good as it could go.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.953
It's kind of nuts here, right?

38:07.986 --> 38:12.190
I mean, every day you wake up,
it's 73 and sunny.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.827
What is that? I like the rain.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.934
They said that I was
"Pittsburgh good,"

38:22.968 --> 38:25.003
which I've decided to take
as a compliment.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.579
Can I hear the song?

38:36.415 --> 38:39.585
I think that I'm done singing
for today.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.856
Bec, please.

38:44.890 --> 38:48.059
Bec?

38:48.093 --> 38:50.028
No one has ever called me that.

38:52.197 --> 38:54.833
I like it.

39:03.074 --> 39:06.678
* People say
it's nice to meet me *

39:06.712 --> 39:12.050
* I often wonder why

39:12.083 --> 39:16.154
* I've studied my reflections

39:16.187 --> 39:20.592
* I've looked me in the eye

39:20.626 --> 39:25.330
* But I still can't
draw conclusions *

39:25.363 --> 39:29.167
* I'm still talking
out of turn *

39:29.200 --> 39:34.105
* Now I ask too many questions

39:34.139 --> 39:38.309
* About the lessons
I won't learn *

39:39.978 --> 39:44.683
* It turns out all my mistakes

39:44.716 --> 39:47.919
* Were forgivable

39:47.953 --> 39:51.757
* And the time I spend lost...

40:04.102 --> 40:06.738
* Was a sign

40:06.772 --> 40:11.477
* That all the ink

40:11.510 --> 40:15.714
* Is invisible

40:15.747 --> 40:17.382
* If you give it

40:17.415 --> 40:21.687
-* Give it enough time

40:27.125 --> 40:30.529
* Now I think my eyes
are open *

40:32.798 --> 40:35.400
* I take a deeper dive

40:35.433 --> 40:40.772
* When I feel the blue
surround me *

40:40.806 --> 40:44.142
* That's when I come alive

40:44.175 --> 40:48.947
* When it starts
to feel too lonely *

40:48.980 --> 40:52.484
* When it's out of my control

40:52.518 --> 40:57.255
* When the world goes on
without me *

40:57.288 --> 41:00.526
* Will I feel it take
its toll? *

41:00.559 --> 41:05.330
* Turns out all my mistakes

41:05.363 --> 41:07.699
* Were forgivable

41:09.835 --> 41:13.639
* The time I spent lost

41:13.672 --> 41:16.441
* Was a sign...

41:16.474 --> 41:18.309
You got two weeks.

41:18.343 --> 41:21.847
* And all the ink

41:21.880 --> 41:23.949
* Is invisible...

41:23.982 --> 41:26.284
You should've left me to rot!

41:26.317 --> 41:29.888
* If you give it

41:29.921 --> 41:33.725
* Give it enough time.

41:47.405 --> 41:49.407
Come on.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.710
Let's go home.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.346
Okay.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.259
