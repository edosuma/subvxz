00:00.987 --> 00:02.521
Behold, my fellow travelers.

00:02.522 --> 00:05.157
Today, we cross the winding straits

00:05.158 --> 00:09.126
to the rocky river
to the shores of Valencia.

00:09.128 --> 00:11.196
No, I wouldn't take the rocky river route.

00:11.197 --> 00:13.131
There are rumors of thieves and bandits.

00:13.132 --> 00:14.833
I don't care about bandits.

00:14.834 --> 00:18.636
I'm Galavant, and Galavant will
be deterred by no foe in his...

00:18.637 --> 00:20.638
Who ate all the raisins
out of the trail mix?

00:20.639 --> 00:22.774
I hate cashews, and Brazil nuts are gross.

00:22.775 --> 00:24.943
You know what?

00:24.944 --> 00:27.545
Heroes get the raisins.
And they choose the path.

00:27.546 --> 00:29.748
That's just the way it goes.

00:29.749 --> 00:33.017
Look, can we just hold it
together for a few more days?

00:33.018 --> 00:34.812
We've been doing so well, right?

00:34.814 --> 00:36.821
- Right.

I thought you said I was gonna
have the big finish this time.

02:40.111 --> 02:41.345
It was supposed to be my turn afterwards.

02:41.346 --> 02:43.180
- It's never your turn.
- Well, no, that's...

02:44.349 --> 02:45.582
Bandits.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.685

02:56.855 --> 03:00.524
I've got something else
you can do with your hands.

03:04.029 --> 03:07.640
I cannot believe My Queen is
cheating on me with that joker.

03:07.642 --> 03:09.142
He's a jester, sir.

03:09.144 --> 03:10.801
I know he's a jester, Gareth.

03:10.802 --> 03:12.546
I was insulting him
by calling him a joker,

03:12.548 --> 03:14.439
like when you call someone a clown.

03:14.439 --> 03:17.541
- But people like clowns.
- Damn it, man! Would you just let me vent?!

03:19.062 --> 03:21.879
I think I know why Madalena
likes him more than me.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.848
He's funny.

03:23.849 --> 03:26.217
How do I compete with that?

03:26.710 --> 03:29.854
Well, funny's easy. I mean, I'm funny.

03:29.855 --> 03:30.888
Really?

03:30.889 --> 03:33.391
- Yeah. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

03:33.392 --> 03:34.892
He's a  you  thing up

03:34.893 --> 03:36.961
you in the  chair

03:36.962 --> 03:38.629
with the  and knees

03:38.630 --> 03:42.366
is taking it
out that son

03:42.367 --> 03:43.701
Good Lord, Gareth.

03:43.702 --> 03:45.469
Do you kiss my ring with that mouth?

03:45.470 --> 03:47.371
My mum taught me that one.

03:47.372 --> 03:49.573
Oof.

03:51.376 --> 03:54.545
Now, if that fool is tickling
my wife's funny bone,

03:54.546 --> 03:56.714
it leaves me no choice.

03:56.715 --> 03:59.116
I know what I have to do.

04:04.823 --> 04:07.091
Hello, jester.

04:07.092 --> 04:09.526
Do you think I'm an idiot?

04:09.527 --> 04:15.499
I know precisely what you have
been doing with my wife.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.002
Aah!

04:19.170 --> 04:20.671
It's a bendy sword.

04:20.672 --> 04:21.839
Isn't that fantastic?

04:21.839 --> 04:23.774
Oh!

04:25.031 --> 04:26.777
Not even a giggle.

04:26.778 --> 04:30.881
See, this is precisely
why I need your help.

04:30.882 --> 04:32.683
Please teach me to be funny.

04:32.684 --> 04:34.318
I'm begging you.

04:34.319 --> 04:35.619
- Gah!
- Ohh!

04:35.620 --> 04:37.287
- Oh!
- Aah!

04:37.288 --> 04:40.390
Even when you know it
bends, you still think... whoa!

04:41.526 --> 04:44.661
Please tell me you hid the jewel.

04:44.662 --> 04:46.130
Of course I hid the jewel...

04:46.131 --> 04:48.098
In a place where no one will ever find it.

04:48.099 --> 04:50.534
Uh, excuse me. Where are you taking us?

04:50.535 --> 04:53.237
The pirate king will decide your fate.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.641
"I don't care what road we choose.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.809
I'm Galavant.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.898
- I get to eat the raisins."
- "I'm Isabella.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.347
I chew with my mouth open like
a cow working on a fresh cud."

05:03.348 --> 05:05.816
I have a deviated septum. I told you that.

05:05.817 --> 05:07.451
I can't breathe through my nose.

05:07.452 --> 05:09.753
If I chew with my mouth closed,
I'd get no air.

05:09.754 --> 05:10.888
Do you want me to die?

05:12.724 --> 05:14.224
Well...

05:14.225 --> 05:17.761
Wait. What are pirates doing
miles from the ocean?

05:22.567 --> 05:25.402
I'm... so sorry. Am I missing something?

05:25.403 --> 05:26.737
Where's your boat?

05:26.738 --> 05:30.540
I'll be asking the questions around here.

05:30.541 --> 05:32.309
Arr!

05:32.310 --> 05:34.277
Actually, go ahead.

05:34.278 --> 05:35.679
I didn't have a question ready.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.182
Um... don't you need a boat to be pirates?

05:39.183 --> 05:40.951
You're on land.

05:40.952 --> 05:43.820
- Land ho!
- Carl, stop it.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.457
All you need to be a pirate
is a dark heart

05:47.458 --> 05:50.227
and a wicked disregard
for other people's lives.

05:50.228 --> 05:51.528
And swords.

05:51.529 --> 05:54.531
Of course swords.
That goes without saying.

05:54.532 --> 05:56.500
Everyone knows pirates need swords.

05:56.501 --> 05:58.435
- What about a hook hand?
- Parrots? Peg legs.

05:58.436 --> 06:01.738

10:52.572 --> 10:54.540
Pirates, that's pomade.

10:54.541 --> 10:57.776
It's for relaxing my curls, not eating.

11:01.081 --> 11:03.348
Right, men.

11:03.348 --> 11:06.417
Let's stow this booty in the chest.

11:06.419 --> 11:08.220
Carl, give me the key.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.359
Oh, come on, guys. Not again.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.328
These idiots really stink
at being pirates.

11:16.329 --> 11:17.429
No kidding.

11:17.430 --> 11:18.831
Unbelievable.

11:18.832 --> 11:21.967
It's kind of nice being
on the same page, isn't it?

11:21.968 --> 11:23.902
It is nice to have a break

11:23.903 --> 11:25.971
from the relentless stream
of criticism, yeah.

11:25.972 --> 11:29.308
Maybe if you did things right,
I wouldn't have to say it.

11:29.309 --> 11:30.709
- Mouth breather.
- Egomaniac.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.277
And it's over.

11:32.278 --> 11:36.348
You. Walk with me.

11:37.817 --> 11:39.284
Oh, right. Of course.

11:50.229 --> 11:51.530
Lads, could you give me a hand?

11:51.531 --> 11:52.631
Arr.

11:56.335 --> 12:00.604
You know, we met before, at Lilith Faire,

12:00.606 --> 12:02.841
the island of Lesbos.

12:02.842 --> 12:06.344
I looked a little different...
Fewer wrinkles.

12:06.345 --> 12:08.113
More like...

12:08.114 --> 12:09.614
Yes, of course.

12:09.615 --> 12:12.050
Well, you're Peter Pillager,
the pirate king.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.753
Well, your men used to be
the scourge of the seas.

12:15.888 --> 12:16.922
What happened there?

12:16.923 --> 12:18.523
Oh.

12:18.524 --> 12:21.393
You know how it is when you
spend too much time with people.

12:21.394 --> 12:23.528
Little things start to get to you...

12:23.529 --> 12:25.463
- Oh...
- And before you know it,

12:25.464 --> 12:27.432
it's all about who's taken whose booty.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.201
"It's my booty." "No, it's my booty."

12:29.202 --> 12:30.769
booty, booty, booty.

12:30.770 --> 12:33.305
- You stopped working together.
- Big-time.

12:33.306 --> 12:37.008
We can't even agree on how to
get our ship off that damn hill.

12:37.009 --> 12:41.313
The truth is...
I could do with a man like you.

12:41.314 --> 12:44.583
So I have a proposition.

12:44.584 --> 12:48.320
Either, "A," I kill all of you

12:48.321 --> 12:51.356
and keep that jewel
and the girls' supplies.

12:51.357 --> 12:56.294
- Why do you want the girls' supplies?
- Or "B," you join me and I let your squire

12:56.295 --> 12:59.264
and that annoying little
mouth breather go.

12:59.265 --> 13:01.700
Well, in all fairness to her,

13:01.701 --> 13:04.035
only 'cause she's not here
to defend herself,

13:04.036 --> 13:06.271
the mouth breathing
is a medical condition,

13:06.272 --> 13:09.507
- so she can't really help it.
- Seems like a pretty simple fix to me.

13:09.508 --> 13:11.476
Put food in mouth, close mouth, chew.

13:11.477 --> 13:13.578
What kind of moron can't do that?

13:15.381 --> 13:18.183
Again, not to get into semantics here,

13:18.184 --> 13:21.286
but if she closes her mouth
while she eats,

13:21.287 --> 13:24.589
she's literally not breathing
out of anywhere.

13:24.590 --> 13:25.757
You get used to it.

13:25.758 --> 13:28.860
Honestly, lately, I can't fall asleep
until she starts snoring.

13:28.861 --> 13:31.162
Dude, you're making me uncomfortable.

13:31.163 --> 13:33.565
Who are you choosing,
me or the mouth breather?

13:33.566 --> 13:37.001
Call her a "mouth breather" one more time.

13:37.002 --> 13:39.237
Mouth breather.

13:39.238 --> 13:41.706
How did you do that?

13:41.707 --> 13:43.641
I keep trying to tell everyone...

13:43.642 --> 13:44.809
Oh.

13:44.810 --> 13:47.345
I'm not just the guy
that eats the raisins.

13:50.082 --> 13:52.050
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:52.051 --> 13:54.986
Chef coming through. Thank you.
This way, my lady.

13:54.987 --> 13:56.788
Here's your table, My Queen.

13:56.789 --> 13:59.757
What fresh idiocy does king
Richard have in store for me now?

13:59.758 --> 14:01.392
Um, I'm...

14:01.393 --> 14:03.361
That was rhetorical. Shoo.

14:03.362 --> 14:06.297
Chef out.

14:07.766 --> 14:09.467
Welcome to the show!

14:09.468 --> 14:12.437
I introduce to you, without further ado,

14:12.438 --> 14:13.905
the king of comedy!

14:13.906 --> 14:17.222
Hello! Thank you very, very, very much.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.177
Now, I understand you've all come here

14:19.178 --> 14:22.113
under threat of death,
and I appreciate it.

14:22.114 --> 14:24.649
In fact... I ordered it.

14:27.419 --> 14:29.320
Everybody laugh!

14:30.923 --> 14:32.581
What on God's flat earth is going on?

14:32.583 --> 14:35.193
Well, they say the way to a woman's heart

14:35.194 --> 14:38.183
- is through her funny bone, so...
- Oh, God. Let's not do this.

14:38.185 --> 14:41.132
Why did the king go to the dentist?

14:41.133 --> 14:42.533
To get his teeth crowned.

14:42.534 --> 14:44.691
To get his teeth crowned.
Uh, you've heard that one.

14:44.693 --> 14:47.004
Mm! "You might be a peasant" jokes.

14:47.005 --> 14:51.275
If you have more children than teeth,

14:51.276 --> 14:53.911
you might be a peasant.

14:56.615 --> 14:58.783
Is this thing on?

14:58.784 --> 15:02.219
Ugh. He's dying out there.
Give him the pie.

15:02.220 --> 15:03.721
Now?!

15:03.722 --> 15:05.523
That's the big finale.

15:05.524 --> 15:07.692
Damn it, man, look at the poor bastard.

15:07.693 --> 15:09.160
Give him the pie.

15:09.161 --> 15:15.488
If your toilet is a tree,
then you might be...

15:22.207 --> 15:25.342
She laughed! It worked! She laughed!

15:25.343 --> 15:28.846
Quick, give me more pies so I can
keep hitting Gareth in the face.

15:28.847 --> 15:32.277
Or someone else. I-I can pie someone else.

15:34.448 --> 15:35.448
You're a fool.

15:35.449 --> 15:37.116
When my men see me captive,

15:37.117 --> 15:39.618
they will swarm on you like hornets.

15:39.619 --> 15:40.953
No. Bees.

15:40.954 --> 15:42.121
No, hornets was better.

15:42.122 --> 15:43.622
Well, you can let them try,

15:43.623 --> 15:46.386
but I'll be damned if I'm letting my team
end up like yours.

15:46.388 --> 15:49.628
So I'm gonna rescue them,
rouse us to work together,

15:49.629 --> 15:51.831
defeat your... hold on.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.501
Oh, for the love of Mike, what happened?

15:55.502 --> 15:56.835
Sid was right.

15:56.836 --> 15:59.171
It was time to stop bickering
and work together.

15:59.172 --> 16:00.673
So we did, and we overthrew the camp.

16:00.674 --> 16:04.410
You missed an amazing battle,
better than anything at castle black.

16:04.411 --> 16:07.179
Well, FYI, I was also gonna come back,

16:07.180 --> 16:09.448
and I was gonna suggest that
we start working together, too,

16:09.449 --> 16:10.849
- wasn't I? Tell them.
- Oh, please, stop.

16:10.850 --> 16:12.484
This whole time, I've been
saying that I was gonna...

16:12.485 --> 16:16.455
- This is all a little humiliating.
- You know what? Doesn't matter.

16:16.456 --> 16:18.023
I know we've been
driving each other crazy,

16:18.024 --> 16:20.092
but I think we've got something
really good going on here.

16:20.093 --> 16:23.195
I mean, look at us...
We're gorgeous, very diverse.

16:23.195 --> 16:27.665
I think if we pull it together, we could
do something great, legendary even.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.335
What do you say?

16:30.336 --> 16:31.703
We are diverse.

16:32.939 --> 16:35.174
Super diverse.

16:35.175 --> 16:37.843
I remember when we had something special.

16:37.844 --> 16:39.611
Arr.

16:39.612 --> 16:40.972
I miss us.

16:41.948 --> 16:44.616
Now, look, either we can take
your pirate supplies...

16:44.617 --> 16:46.385
The swords, the hooks...

16:46.386 --> 16:47.386
- Parrots.
- Booty.

16:47.387 --> 16:48.854
- Peg legs.
- Girls' supplies.

16:48.855 --> 16:51.356
Yes, yes, all of it,
or we can work together

16:51.357 --> 16:56.028
to get your ship off that hill
and you can take us to Valencia.

16:56.029 --> 16:57.062
What do you say?

17:04.037 --> 17:06.338
Did I just cut your hand?

17:06.339 --> 17:08.707
Yes. Very badly.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.509
Sorry.

17:16.082 --> 17:17.749
Where are you going?

17:17.750 --> 17:19.584
It's time for 4:00 fool-around.

17:19.585 --> 17:20.660
Is it?

17:20.662 --> 17:23.922
M-my sundial must be slow
because of the... c-clouds.

17:23.923 --> 17:26.590
If you're worried I'm upset
about you helping my husband

17:26.592 --> 17:28.827
with that ridiculous show, then don't be.

17:28.828 --> 17:31.997
Who cares? He's an idiot.

17:31.998 --> 17:33.598
Yes, well, that's the thing.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.233
I don't think I can do this anymore.

17:35.234 --> 17:39.938
I guess I just feel a little... guilty.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.606
Well, that's very noble of you

17:41.607 --> 17:43.875
to care about someone's feelings.

17:43.876 --> 17:45.839
Guards!

17:45.841 --> 17:48.511
If you're developing a conscience,
then you're no good to me.

17:48.513 --> 17:50.949
Take him to the dungeon,
the really scary one.

17:50.950 --> 17:52.117
With the mice.

17:52.118 --> 17:53.284
Wait, no! Please!

17:53.285 --> 17:54.953
At least let me change my clothes!

17:54.954 --> 17:57.455
These are gang colors!

17:57.456 --> 17:59.958
Oh, hello.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.226
I was just coming to see Steve.

18:01.227 --> 18:02.727
Who's Steve?

18:02.728 --> 18:05.363
Steve McKinzie. The jester.

18:05.364 --> 18:07.932
You don't know his name?

18:07.933 --> 18:09.567
Well, no matter.

18:09.568 --> 18:13.738
Say, what do you call
a tiny mosquito in a tin suit?

18:13.739 --> 18:15.573
- Oh, God.
- Nope.

18:15.574 --> 18:17.575
A <i> gnat</i> in shining armor.

18:17.576 --> 18:20.645
- I've got so many of these.
- Please stop talking.

18:20.646 --> 18:22.247
No, I love talking with you.

18:22.248 --> 18:24.582
Right, you maggots!

18:24.583 --> 18:27.485
Let's get this boat off the hill.

18:27.486 --> 18:29.787
What?

18:29.788 --> 18:32.790
It's just nice to hear you
call us "maggots" again.

18:32.791 --> 18:35.627
You've always been maggots in here.

18:35.628 --> 18:37.595

Gal...

19:33.619 --> 19:34.952
Can I call you "Gal"?

19:34.953 --> 19:36.487
Uh, well, I don't love it.

19:36.488 --> 19:39.323
I have to talk to you.

19:39.324 --> 19:40.858
I feel a little guilty about something.

19:40.859 --> 19:43.127
Actually, so do I.

19:43.128 --> 19:45.496
I stashed a bag of trail mix
before we left.

19:46.665 --> 19:47.999
Raisins intact.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.400
Really?

19:49.401 --> 19:50.568
Knock yourself out.

19:50.569 --> 19:52.636
And feel free to eat with your mouth open.

19:52.637 --> 19:54.305
It's not as gross as I make it out to be.

19:54.306 --> 19:58.008
I mean, it's gross,
but it's not gross-gross.

19:59.644 --> 20:02.680
Listen, Galavant,

20:02.681 --> 20:05.349
I think the reason
I've been so difficult recently

20:05.350 --> 20:09.019
is that I was villainizing you
so I felt better about myself.

20:09.020 --> 20:13.190
I'm probably signing my parents' death
warrant by telling you this, but...

20:13.191 --> 20:14.525
I lied.

20:14.526 --> 20:17.061
I'm leading you into a trap.

20:19.503 --> 20:20.931
Galavant?

20:20.932 --> 20:22.666
We're almost there.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.169
Did you hear anything I just said?

20:25.170 --> 20:27.171
Sorry.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.519
I don't always listen when you talk.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.371
I will get better in that.

20:31.373 --> 20:32.847
***

20:32.848 --> 20:34.848
Your parents or something?

20:36.097 --> 20:38.091
I look foward to see them.

20:38.092 --> 20:41.292
Right. Yeah, parents are the best.

20:42.448 --> 20:44.878
***

20:44.879 --> 20:46.472
To Valencia!

20:46.473 --> 20:48.473
Arr!

20:50.449 --> 20:52.449
I'm coming, my love.
