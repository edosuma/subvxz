00:00.109 --> 00:01.671
<i>Previously on
"Famous In Love..."</i>

00:01.688 --> 00:03.731
I can do the movie
and stay in school.

00:03.732 --> 00:05.858
Being a movie star
isn't a part-time job.

00:05.859 --> 00:07.359
You have to make a choice.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.528
Any chance you can come
over more than once a week?

00:09.529 --> 00:10.696
I'll pay you an extra 50.

00:10.697 --> 00:12.364
You look a lot like a guy...

00:12.365 --> 00:13.782
Yeah, movies. People
think they know you.

00:13.783 --> 00:14.950
<i>I promise you you don't.</i>

00:14.951 --> 00:17.494
Can we start over? I'm a
different person now.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.708
Alan Mills, do I need
to call security?

00:19.733 --> 00:21.540
Tell them your new boss is here.

00:21.541 --> 00:23.459
Did I see you arrive
with Paige Townsen?

00:23.460 --> 00:24.501
Yeah, we're good friends.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.336
Any friend of Paige's
is a friend of mine.

00:26.337 --> 00:28.106
_

00:28.131 --> 00:31.340
You're sure you can make this
movie and stay in school.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.303
Dad, I promise I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to do both.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.055
<i>Freshman theater workshop.</i>

00:36.056 --> 00:37.097
That's when I knew we'd
be friends forever.

00:37.098 --> 00:39.343
That's what you need
right now, a friend.

00:39.368 --> 00:41.286
It wouldn't be right
to complicate things.

- Hey, you.
- Did you pull an all-nighter?

01:09.339 --> 01:12.132
Well, I woke up with
a line of drool

01:12.133 --> 01:14.176
all over my macro
theory textbook

01:14.177 --> 01:16.261
so I'm not sure that counts.

01:16.262 --> 01:17.971
So did you finish your paper?

01:17.972 --> 01:20.307
No, I'm still researching

01:20.308 --> 01:21.725
but I'm rescheduling
the wardrobe fitting

01:21.726 --> 01:24.545
I had this morning, so I
have the whole day now.

01:24.607 --> 01:26.747
Your light was on
pretty late last night.

01:26.772 --> 01:29.482
I was working on my pitch
for the film board.

01:29.483 --> 01:32.109
What? You got a slot to
pitch your film thesis?

01:32.110 --> 01:33.777
- Yeah. Friday.
- Ah.

01:33.778 --> 01:35.404
If I get it, they're gonna
pay for the entire thing.

01:35.405 --> 01:36.780
Oh, my God!

01:36.781 --> 01:40.450
Jake, that's... amazing!

01:40.451 --> 01:42.914
Forget that stupid agent
that passed on your script.

01:42.939 --> 01:44.372
This is...

01:44.872 --> 01:47.499
so much better.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.126
What? What is it?
What did I miss?

01:49.127 --> 01:51.420
Jake got a slot to
pitch his film thesis!

01:51.421 --> 01:53.880
- What? Jake, that's awesome!
- I know.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.133
You're by far the best
director in the class.

01:56.134 --> 01:57.551
You're definitely gonna
win that grant, Jake.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.844
<i>Well, let's hope so</i>

01:58.845 --> 02:01.026
<i>cause I cannot ask my
parents for anymore money</i>

02:01.051 --> 02:02.556
<i>plus, the whole point
of going to film school</i>

02:02.557 --> 02:04.128
was to graduate with a film.

02:04.153 --> 02:05.350
And who wants pancakes?

02:05.351 --> 02:06.352
- Me.
- Me.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.252
So how's the paper coming along?

02:10.276 --> 02:12.153
I'll finish my research by noon

02:12.154 --> 02:13.863
write the first ten
pages this afternoon

02:13.864 --> 02:17.075
ten more pages tomorrow morning
and turn that bad boy in.

02:17.076 --> 02:18.368
- Ambitious.
- Mm-hmm.

02:18.369 --> 02:20.453
I don't really have a choice,
so it's worth half my grade.

02:20.454 --> 02:22.205
Is there anything
we can help with?

02:22.206 --> 02:24.291
How's your knowledge
on net neutrality?

02:25.032 --> 02:26.293
Figured.

02:27.544 --> 02:30.212
- <i>Hey, who are you texting so early?</i>
- _

02:30.237 --> 02:32.993
Well, since I've been spending
so much time at the Pizza Dome

02:33.018 --> 02:34.384
I decided to apply
for a job there.

02:34.385 --> 02:35.385
That's great!

02:35.386 --> 02:36.803
Can I borrow your skirt again

02:36.804 --> 02:38.054
for the interview?

02:38.055 --> 02:40.432
- Yes. <i>Me closet et su closet.</i>
- Thanks.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:50.025 --> 02:51.943
Wow, every time you do that

02:51.944 --> 02:53.946
I'm more and more impressed.

02:54.738 --> 02:57.658
Um, Jake, you and I...

02:59.618 --> 03:01.744
we're still good, right?

03:01.745 --> 03:03.580
Yeah. We're good.

03:04.498 --> 03:06.250
Yeah.

03:11.296 --> 03:13.135
- Oh, my God.
- What?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.785
I-I just got seven
texts from Nina Devon.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.927
She's not letting me
reschedule my wardrobe fitting

03:17.952 --> 03:20.863
and she needs to see
me at her office...

03:21.598 --> 03:22.975
now.

03:38.407 --> 03:41.909
Hi. Nina, you said you
wanted to speak to me.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.245
You missed your wardrobe
fitting this morning. Why?

03:44.246 --> 03:47.665
Uh, y-yeah, uh, you know,
actually, I rescheduled...

03:47.666 --> 03:49.375
Where were you?

03:49.376 --> 03:51.544
I was studying for a paper.

03:51.545 --> 03:53.104
That's not my problem.

03:53.129 --> 03:54.881
I do not have time to
be your babysitter.

03:54.882 --> 03:56.806
You need an agent.

03:56.831 --> 03:58.468
You also need a publicist,
a lawyer and a manager

03:58.469 --> 04:01.157
but let's start with the agent.

04:01.182 --> 04:03.555
I've set you a meeting
with Ken Chapman at TAC.

04:03.557 --> 04:05.330
He will walk you through
your deal and your life

04:05.354 --> 04:06.934
over lunch today at Savoy.

04:06.935 --> 04:08.519
Uh, today? No.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.605
- Uh, actually, I-I can't...
- I'm sorry.

04:10.606 --> 04:12.857
Are you too busy to be the star
of a major motion picture?

04:12.858 --> 04:14.275
Uh, n-no, no, no.

04:14.276 --> 04:17.197
Uh, o-of-of course not. I, I...

04:17.223 --> 04:20.298
Today is just great, actually.

04:21.241 --> 04:23.243
Thanks so much, Nina.

04:34.015 --> 04:35.475
Would you like a drink?

04:38.311 --> 04:40.437
Who's Jake Salt?

04:40.438 --> 04:44.441
Uh, friend/roommate
of Paige Townsen.

04:44.442 --> 04:46.780
There's some sort of weird
"Three's Company" thing

04:46.805 --> 04:47.972
happening with her.

04:47.973 --> 04:49.181
Okay, so you hate her.

04:49.182 --> 04:50.599
So why are you
reading his script?

04:50.600 --> 04:53.394
Because I haven't been
sent a script in months

04:53.419 --> 04:55.477
and I would be perfect
for the lead.

04:55.531 --> 04:59.409
Maybe I can earn my way back to
the top with some indie cred.

04:59.410 --> 05:02.202
Oh, look at you
being so ambitious.

05:02.227 --> 05:04.456
Well, I have to hunt
down my own projects now

05:04.457 --> 05:06.333
since my agent forgot how
to dial a telephone...

05:06.334 --> 05:08.046
Hey, babe, you are in "Locked."

05:08.071 --> 05:10.837
I'm playing the dumbass
sister, remember?

05:10.838 --> 05:13.381
Well, I mean, at least
we're in it together.

05:13.382 --> 05:15.530
I mean, that's something, right?

05:17.261 --> 05:19.846
Okay. Wow. That hurts.

05:19.847 --> 05:21.932
No, it's...

05:21.933 --> 05:25.435
it's something. It's awesome.
It...

05:25.436 --> 05:29.074
I'm afraid that, uh, if
we start working together

05:29.099 --> 05:30.690
it will complicate things.

05:30.691 --> 05:33.777
Really? We're back here again?

05:33.778 --> 05:35.654
You don't wanna go public?

05:35.655 --> 05:36.988
Well, it's not because
you're a girl.

05:36.989 --> 05:39.631
It's because my private
life is private.

05:39.656 --> 05:42.536
Yeah, okay, that's your code
for I don't wanna commit.

05:42.537 --> 05:43.620
- I don't do code.
- Look.

05:43.621 --> 05:45.413
One minute you kiss me
and then the next minute

05:45.414 --> 05:47.040
you act like we're strangers.

05:47.041 --> 05:48.542
Okay, Rach, dial
down the drama...

05:48.543 --> 05:51.294
Uh, no, I'm, I'm not
gonna go on that set

05:51.295 --> 05:53.380
and pretend like we're
just friends, okay?

05:53.381 --> 05:55.590
So you might as well
figure out what you want

05:55.591 --> 05:57.343
before that movie starts.

06:00.346 --> 06:02.348
I know exactly what I want.

06:09.109 --> 06:11.990
Devon, we need to talk.

06:18.693 --> 06:22.117
How can I help you, Alan?
Do you need a tampon?

06:22.118 --> 06:23.702
Well, you need to
cut three million

06:23.703 --> 06:24.911
from the "Locked" budget.

06:24.912 --> 06:26.872
I know you're late to the
party, but I've squeezed

06:26.873 --> 06:29.040
every possible penny
from that budget.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.005
Well, then you need
to get creative.

06:31.052 --> 06:32.294
"Locked" is a summer tent-pole.

06:32.295 --> 06:34.087
You know, blockbusters
don't come cheap.

06:34.088 --> 06:35.685
Cut three mil...

06:36.340 --> 06:37.425
or you're fired.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.808
Anything else, Mr. Mills?

06:43.222 --> 06:45.390
Oh, Tangey's deal hasn't closed

06:45.391 --> 06:47.393
so, uh, get that done.

06:49.238 --> 06:51.521
TAC? Aren't they one of the
biggest agencies in town?

06:51.522 --> 06:53.064
And are you sure she said Savoy

06:53.065 --> 06:55.442
because Matt Damon loves
their lamb chops.

06:55.536 --> 06:56.661
<i>Guys, what am I gonna do?</i>

06:56.662 --> 06:58.831
I mean, I'm not gonna be
able to finish my paper

06:58.856 --> 07:00.081
if I break for lunch.

07:00.082 --> 07:01.791
Paige, you're looking
at this wrong.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.794
Agents make your life easier.
My mom loved hers.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.921
- You knew your mom's agent?
- Sid Siddleberg.

07:06.922 --> 07:08.590
He repped all the
big soap stars.

07:08.591 --> 07:10.717
And he still sends
me a Christmas card.

07:10.718 --> 07:12.715
- Was your mom that famous?
- No.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.660
But she would have been
if she didn't get sick.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.853
Cassie, I, uh, really
want you to come with me.

07:21.854 --> 07:24.718
You can kick me under the table
if I say anything stupid.

07:24.743 --> 07:25.785
I'm in.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.901
And, Jake, I know it's
a lot to ask of you

07:27.902 --> 07:29.486
and you're busy with your
pitch and everything

07:29.487 --> 07:31.779
but do you think you could
take off one hour for me?

07:31.780 --> 07:34.449
- You don't need me for this.
- Yes, I do.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.493
Remember when you negotiated
the deal for my car?

07:36.494 --> 07:38.847
I mean, it died a mile after
we drove it off the lot.

07:38.872 --> 07:39.996
Not the point, Cassie

07:39.997 --> 07:42.040
Jake still fixed the
alternatey thingy

07:42.041 --> 07:44.209
and, boom, the rest is history.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.252
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That was way different.

07:46.253 --> 07:48.546
Jake, you're not
gonna need a grant

07:48.547 --> 07:50.798
if you have an agent
selling your script.

07:50.799 --> 07:52.343
You should bring it with you.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.387
Okay, alright, I'm in.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.139
- Yay!
- Yay!

07:58.557 --> 08:00.058
- Hm.
- Ow. Ow.

08:06.815 --> 08:08.195
Yo.

08:09.026 --> 08:11.226
You took your own sweet-ass
time getting here.

08:11.251 --> 08:14.197
- What do you want this time?
- I want out of this fresh hell.

08:14.198 --> 08:16.866
You think I like serving
drunks night after night?

08:16.867 --> 08:18.398
Well, it takes one to know one.

08:18.423 --> 08:19.744
Oh?

08:19.745 --> 08:22.497
I see the big movie star's
got a mouth on him.

08:22.498 --> 08:24.151
Well, I got a mouth, too.

08:24.152 --> 08:25.778
I wonder what your
adoring fans would think

08:25.802 --> 08:27.929
if they knew about the real you.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.216
How much do you want?

08:33.217 --> 08:34.926
Fifty grand.

08:34.927 --> 08:37.511
Fifty.. Are you
out of your mind?

08:37.513 --> 08:40.347
I got my eyes set on opening
a nail salon in Tucson.

08:40.349 --> 08:42.600
Consider it your final payment.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.644
I need time. That's
a lot of money.

08:44.645 --> 08:48.016
You got two days or
I start talking.

09:05.085 --> 09:06.303
You were in the water alone?

09:06.328 --> 09:08.245
You know I'd rather you
surf with a friend.

09:08.246 --> 09:09.796
You coming to join me?

09:09.821 --> 09:11.665
I'm kidding. What's up?

09:11.666 --> 09:13.792
Alan's hardballing
me on the budget.

09:13.793 --> 09:15.382
I need to cut three mil.

09:15.407 --> 09:18.255
- Or what? He'll shut us down?
- No.

09:18.256 --> 09:19.840
He'll fire me.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.300
So what are you gonna do?

09:21.301 --> 09:23.460
Look, I've slashed
everything below the line

09:23.485 --> 09:25.679
and there's no way to
get there unless...

09:25.680 --> 09:27.946
- I cut my fee.
- Not just you.

09:27.971 --> 09:29.600
The entire cast.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.508
But my deal's been
closed for months.

09:31.533 --> 09:33.354
I'll restructure it.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.606
I'll, uh, adjust your points

09:35.607 --> 09:36.857
and you'll make it
on the back end.

09:36.858 --> 09:38.652
If it's a hit.

09:41.144 --> 09:44.532
Honey, everything I have
is invested in "Locked."

09:45.973 --> 09:47.409
I've even borrowed
money from people

09:47.410 --> 09:48.869
I would never want you to meet.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.706
I had no choice.

09:58.779 --> 10:00.781
I'll do anything
you need me to do.

10:02.008 --> 10:03.300
Thank you.

10:08.807 --> 10:12.476
Truffle grilled cheese sandwich
with charcoal ice cream?

10:12.477 --> 10:14.436
It's like lunch and
dessert all in one.

10:14.437 --> 10:16.814
Thirty six dollars?

10:16.815 --> 10:19.274
Have you read the prices?

10:19.275 --> 10:22.695
- Well, I got a twenty.
- I can come up with four bucks.

10:22.696 --> 10:25.322
Paige Townsen. Ken Chapman.

10:25.323 --> 10:27.741
Hi. Nice to meet you.

10:27.742 --> 10:29.326
Well, I see you already
got an entourage.

10:29.327 --> 10:31.829
No, these are my friends.
This is Jake and Cassie.

10:31.830 --> 10:34.581
Oh, well, thank you
for allowing me

10:34.582 --> 10:36.721
to take you all out to lunch.

10:36.746 --> 10:38.748
What do you say we eat
first, talk business later?

10:41.965 --> 10:43.441
If handled the right way

10:43.466 --> 10:45.725
a franchise can be a
meal ticket for life.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.972
Hey, Ken. Ken, what's up?

10:47.997 --> 10:49.916
Ethan, Grayson.

10:50.787 --> 10:53.308
Oh, my God! That's
the Dolan twins.

10:53.309 --> 10:55.242
Grayson, Ethan, this
is Paige Townsen.

10:55.267 --> 10:57.050
- She's the star of the new...
- The "Locked" books.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.522
<i>Our fans are obsessed.</i>

10:58.523 --> 11:01.233
- I'm Team Ed.
- I'm Team Noah all the way.

11:01.234 --> 11:02.818
<i>Alright, we look alike,
but we don't think alike</i>

11:02.819 --> 11:03.819
except when it
comes to this guy.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.946
- Oh.
- Ken's the man.

11:05.947 --> 11:07.573
You're in good hands, Paige.

11:07.574 --> 11:09.790
Oh, did our attorney get back to
you about the, uh, tour dates?

11:09.814 --> 11:12.202
Oh. Hey, just give
me two minutes.

11:13.538 --> 11:15.025
They're so cute.

11:23.384 --> 11:25.288
What the hell are
you doing here?

11:26.718 --> 11:28.969
Sorry. Jeanette told me
you'd be gone today.

11:28.970 --> 11:31.346
<i>I thought it'd be a good
time to finish moving out.</i>

11:31.347 --> 11:33.766
<i>In sports, the International
Basketball League was busy...</i>

11:37.483 --> 11:40.366
_

11:43.735 --> 11:45.183
Dude, are you okay?

11:46.863 --> 11:48.222
Yeah.

11:52.702 --> 11:55.204
Well, thanks for
what you did today.

11:55.205 --> 11:57.207
<i>My agents were
never gonna budge.</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:00.877
S-so you didn't take a pay cut?

12:01.768 --> 12:04.046
- Oh, man, I-I-I thought...
- Just go.

12:04.047 --> 12:06.321
- Bro, I'm sorry, I...
- Whatever, just go.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.888
<i>Back to you, Paige.</i>

12:12.889 --> 12:14.681
"Locked" starts
shooting in a few days.

12:14.682 --> 12:17.226
So you know how we
handle this opportunity

12:17.227 --> 12:20.442
could really determine your
career for the next 20 years.

12:20.467 --> 12:22.773
But no pressure, right?

12:22.774 --> 12:24.691
Uh, you know

12:24.692 --> 12:26.860
you've already got a bunch
of interview requests

12:26.861 --> 12:28.529
so we're gonna set you
up with a publicist...

12:28.530 --> 12:30.489
- When, when are those?
- <i>Uh, well...</i>

12:30.490 --> 12:32.908
you're gonna need 'em for the
press junkets and the photos.

12:32.909 --> 12:35.244
There's the "Vanity Fair" teaser
spread that shoots tomorrow...

12:35.245 --> 12:38.205
Wait, what? N-nobody
told me about that.

12:38.206 --> 12:40.415
Is there any way this stuff
could wait a few days?

12:40.416 --> 12:43.669
'Cause Paige has a paper due
that's worth half her grade

12:43.670 --> 12:46.547
<i>and she'd promised her dad that
she'd continue her classes.</i>

12:46.548 --> 12:49.133
Yeah, about school, um,
that's gonna be an issue.

12:49.134 --> 12:52.052
She knows that, but we were
wondering if there is any way...

12:52.077 --> 12:54.239
Why don't we talk about it
when you come to my office?

12:54.264 --> 12:55.430
You know, and if your
friends don't mind

12:55.431 --> 12:57.724
maybe when you come down,
it'll just be you?

12:57.725 --> 13:00.382
Uh, well, why can't we
talk about it here?

13:00.407 --> 13:01.408
Well...

13:02.897 --> 13:04.577
Is that yours?

13:04.816 --> 13:07.234
Yeah. Actually, he's
a writer-director.

13:07.235 --> 13:10.696
Oh, wow! Hyphenated already.
That's impressive.

13:10.697 --> 13:12.990
Well, can I read it?

13:12.991 --> 13:14.658
That's why he brought it.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.661
Hey, I'll look it
through tonight.

13:17.453 --> 13:20.205
So am I allowed to ask

13:20.206 --> 13:22.492
how much money I'm
making on "Locked?"

13:22.517 --> 13:24.752
No one told you when
your deal closed?

13:25.712 --> 13:27.078
Oh.

13:35.054 --> 13:37.764
- Can you live with that?
- Uh, she can live with it.

13:37.765 --> 13:38.891
Yeah.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.565
Paige, this movie is
gonna make you rich.

13:46.566 --> 13:48.275
Yes. But you know what
my dad's gonna say?

13:48.276 --> 13:49.651
It's actually not
that much money

13:49.652 --> 13:52.237
once everybody gets their
cut, including Uncle Sam.

13:52.238 --> 13:53.322
Then he's gonna say
a lot could happen

13:53.323 --> 13:55.073
between now and when
the movie comes out

13:55.074 --> 13:56.158
so it could really fall apart.

13:56.159 --> 13:57.618
Anything could happen.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.246
And then he's also gonna say

13:59.271 --> 14:01.413
"Nobody can take
away your education.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.999
"That's the one thing nobody
can take away from you."

14:06.419 --> 14:09.296
Oh, my God. This really
is a conspiracy.

14:09.297 --> 14:10.923
They just rescheduled my
fitting for right now.

14:10.924 --> 14:12.174
Paige, relax.

14:12.175 --> 14:13.800
As it is I'm really
behind on this paper

14:13.801 --> 14:15.052
and if you weren't
working on your pitch

14:15.053 --> 14:18.347
I would just hire you to help
me with the econ research.

14:18.348 --> 14:20.726
Oh, l-look, I can do both.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.809
Uh, we can do the research

14:22.810 --> 14:24.948
and I can start writing tonight.

14:25.527 --> 14:27.987
It means a lot that you got
my script to your agent.

14:28.012 --> 14:29.191
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:29.192 --> 14:31.276
A friend in need
is a pain indeed

14:31.301 --> 14:33.887
but we love you anyway
and we got this.

14:35.235 --> 14:37.071
Seriously? Are you guys sure?

14:38.117 --> 14:40.327
Oh, my God. Thank you, guys,
thank you, thank you.

14:40.328 --> 14:41.962
I really, really owe you one.

14:41.987 --> 14:43.205
Okay, thank you so much.

14:43.206 --> 14:45.291
- My car's here. Bye-bye!
- Good luck.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.095
Uh, one sec. I need to
reschedule my interview.

14:55.259 --> 14:57.552
Hey, Brody, it's Lacey.

14:57.553 --> 14:59.798
Uh, I need to cancel for today.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.318
<i>Look, I totally respect
Tangey's creative process</i>

15:13.319 --> 15:16.627
but you need to tell Ida that
I have to talk to her today.

15:16.652 --> 15:19.117
Tell her her daughter's "Locked"
deal is about to go away.

15:20.743 --> 15:21.952
<i>She's on the phone.</i>

15:21.953 --> 15:23.787
I gave up a million
dollars for Jordan?

15:23.788 --> 15:25.205
Are you kidding me?

15:25.206 --> 15:27.457
You did not give up
that money for him.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.529
You gave it up for me.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.729
You said the whole
cast was taking a cut.

15:31.754 --> 15:33.422
Everyone did...

15:33.423 --> 15:34.923
except Jordan.

15:34.924 --> 15:36.049
Including you?

15:36.050 --> 15:37.884
I sacrificed more than my fee

15:37.885 --> 15:40.040
to get this movie made.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.288
Rainer?

15:43.617 --> 15:45.159
Look...

15:45.309 --> 15:46.685
we sold "Locked" to the studio

15:46.686 --> 15:48.020
based on the book's popularity

15:48.021 --> 15:51.867
but also because of
its critical acclaim.

15:52.706 --> 15:54.943
I need an actor who can
bring that kind of cache

15:54.944 --> 15:56.446
to the project.

15:58.071 --> 15:59.534
And that's not me?

16:02.900 --> 16:04.675
I'm sorry...

16:05.288 --> 16:07.164
but I need Jordan.
His indie films...

16:07.165 --> 16:08.373
You know, every once in a while

16:08.374 --> 16:11.941
I need you not to be Nina
Devon, the producer.

16:12.712 --> 16:14.254
I need you to be my mom.

16:14.255 --> 16:17.549
It's not just the movie. You
know what he did to me.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.255
This was one of those times.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.765
Rainer, I...

16:34.991 --> 16:37.158
_

16:37.183 --> 16:40.253
Oh, hell, no. Is this
your parking spot?

16:40.254 --> 16:43.256
Yeah, they told me to park here.

16:43.257 --> 16:45.176
Where is yours?

16:47.053 --> 16:49.179
Not here.

16:50.598 --> 16:52.474
Um, I'm sorry.

16:52.475 --> 16:56.061
Uh, I'm-I'm gonna be late,
but I'll see you inside.

17:03.206 --> 17:04.867
You have perfect timing.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.550
I need a closer parking
spot worked into my deal.

17:07.551 --> 17:08.969
<i>Lot A is for extras
and nobodies...</i>

17:08.970 --> 17:11.012
Uh, look, I was calling to
say we're passing for you.

17:11.013 --> 17:12.473
Why would I do that?

17:12.473 --> 17:14.888
<i>The numbers are just too low.</i>

17:14.914 --> 17:16.977
- How low?
- The offer was an insult.

17:16.978 --> 17:18.608
How low?

17:19.021 --> 17:20.231
Scale.

17:26.897 --> 17:28.113
Adriana...

17:28.542 --> 17:30.127
I need this.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.402
What, you actually wanna do it?

17:33.616 --> 17:35.455
Just close the deal.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.125
Were you guys able to
find the IPO valuations?

17:40.126 --> 17:42.171
- Ooh, ow!
- Hold still, honey.

17:42.196 --> 17:44.088
Uh, yeah. We got 'em right here.

17:44.089 --> 17:45.964
We couldn't find your statistical
comparisons, though.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.258
Oh, they're, uh, they're-they're
in my green notebook.

17:48.259 --> 17:50.511
Um, right over on the..
Ah! Ha-ha-ha...

17:50.512 --> 17:52.221
- I'm sorry.
- Um...

17:52.222 --> 17:54.181
I really need to be out of
here in, like, 20 minutes.

17:54.182 --> 17:57.184
- I really have to be home.
- Yeah. I'll have you out in 15.

17:57.185 --> 17:59.061
Amazing. Um...

17:59.062 --> 18:00.979
Do you guys mind
starting the analysis?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.898
It might save me a
little, I think.

18:02.923 --> 18:05.442
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Oh, thanks.

18:15.912 --> 18:18.736
You look wonderful.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.126
Uh, I have to go.

18:22.127 --> 18:25.775
Uh, I'm gonna call you guys back, okay?
Alright, bye.

18:31.928 --> 18:35.612
- How's it going?
- I'm bursting at the seams.

18:35.637 --> 18:38.055
Literally and figuratively.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.457
Um, I really have to get home
'cause I have a paper due.

18:41.813 --> 18:43.147
Don't shoot the messenger

18:43.148 --> 18:46.024
but they need us for a
camera test on Stage 18.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.986
I'm supposed to get you
to Hair and Makeup.

18:50.071 --> 18:53.249
I swear, this really
is a conspiracy.

18:57.495 --> 19:00.354
Jordan, I got your message.

19:00.832 --> 19:02.260
I need some money.

19:04.169 --> 19:05.669
How much are we talkin'?

19:05.670 --> 19:08.172
Fifty thousand. In cash.

19:08.173 --> 19:10.370
You can take it from
my personal account.

19:10.893 --> 19:13.802
Look, Jordan, I'm hired
to handle your money

19:13.803 --> 19:15.637
and I know it's
none of my business

19:15.638 --> 19:17.473
but this is the third
time this year

19:17.474 --> 19:19.680
you've asked for fast cash.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.102
- You in some kind of trouble?
- It's my money, right?

19:22.103 --> 19:23.883
So just get it done.

19:25.907 --> 19:27.266
Alright.

19:29.692 --> 19:31.442
- So do we just stand here?
- Mm-hmm.

19:33.698 --> 19:35.389
<i>Stay on your mark, please.</i>

19:40.455 --> 19:43.332
How long do these
things usually take?

19:43.333 --> 19:46.293
Uh, I know you need
to get out of here.

19:46.294 --> 19:48.296
Wish we could make it go faster.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.842
August, turn to
face Noah, please.

19:58.503 --> 20:01.285
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:02.143 --> 20:04.478
- Maybe she's driving.
- She better be.

20:04.479 --> 20:06.035
She said she'd be
home two hours ago.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.228
There must have been a
problem with the dress.

20:08.253 --> 20:11.738
Yeah. And I'm sure Rainer
had nothing to do with it.

20:11.903 --> 20:13.527
You don't know that.

20:18.076 --> 20:20.160
Okay.

20:20.161 --> 20:22.412
<i>Thank you for driving
me back to my car.</i>

20:22.413 --> 20:24.665
My friends are gonna kill me

20:24.666 --> 20:29.211
and... honestly, I
don't blame them.

20:29.212 --> 20:32.839
Jake's supposed to be working
on his pitch, but instead..

20:32.840 --> 20:34.872
Wait, stop, stop the car.

20:36.615 --> 20:38.295
_

20:38.429 --> 20:40.138
Is that us?

20:40.163 --> 20:42.099
They just started
buildin' our sets.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.519
You wanna see?

20:45.895 --> 20:48.059
Yeah. I think, yeah.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.904
Wow.

20:55.905 --> 20:58.248
This is one of the biggest
stages on the lot.

21:08.626 --> 21:10.094
Jimmy Stewart

21:10.119 --> 21:12.628
Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant

21:12.630 --> 21:15.925
they all made movies right
where you're standing.

21:18.303 --> 21:20.728
I've always dreamed of this.

21:22.098 --> 21:24.683
I've been acting for ten years

21:24.684 --> 21:27.212
and every time they
put up new sets...

21:28.688 --> 21:30.148
it never gets old.

21:47.624 --> 21:50.000
You're still awake.

21:50.001 --> 21:51.960
Your research is on the table.

21:51.961 --> 21:53.295
Oh, wow!

21:53.296 --> 21:54.505
Thank you.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.085
Are you writing your pitch?

22:00.345 --> 22:02.347
Yeah. Finally.

22:07.352 --> 22:08.686
I'm sorry.

22:10.271 --> 22:14.232
We ended up having to do this
camera test and it took forever

22:14.233 --> 22:17.110
and then Rainer took me to
see some of our stages.

22:17.111 --> 22:19.738
Uh, it was really cool, um..

22:19.739 --> 22:21.338
Goodnight.

22:25.370 --> 22:26.371
Goodnight.

22:37.207 --> 22:39.708
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, those bags.

22:39.709 --> 22:41.502
Yeah, I know, but
it's a book bag.

22:41.503 --> 22:43.257
I meant the bags
under your eyes.

22:43.282 --> 22:45.672
Oh. Sorry, I pulled
an all-nighter.

22:45.673 --> 22:47.591
- I hope he was worth it.
- Uh, no.

22:47.592 --> 22:50.427
I'm in the middle of this big
econ paper I have due tomorrow

22:50.428 --> 22:52.179
and, uh, never mind.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.640
I'm Francine, your stylist
and fairy godmother.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.108
Alright. Come on.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.437
Stop me if you see
something you like.

23:00.563 --> 23:02.106
Oh, wow.

23:02.223 --> 23:05.028
That looks just like Jennifer
Lawrence's Oscar dress.

23:06.402 --> 23:09.404
Today it's Paige
Townsen's dress.

23:20.187 --> 23:24.273
♪ We could do this all night ♪

23:24.337 --> 23:27.549
♪ We could do this all night.. ♪

23:28.424 --> 23:31.510
Wow. I am good.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.512

23:33.513 --> 23:35.681

23:43.106 --> 23:44.857
<i>Ah. Oh, yeah.</i>

23:44.858 --> 23:46.860
Ah, I love when the bass
comes in like that.

23:48.278 --> 23:50.120
This is great.

23:50.145 --> 23:52.588
You're a hard woman
to track down.

23:52.613 --> 23:55.323
Oh. Give me a minute.

23:55.493 --> 23:58.412
- We just wrapped a session.
- Did you get my message?

23:58.413 --> 24:01.123
Like I said, we just wrapped.

24:01.124 --> 24:03.750
I don't take calls when
Tangey's recordin'.

24:03.751 --> 24:05.309
Look, uh...

24:05.334 --> 24:08.229
we've had our ups
and downs, but...

24:08.254 --> 24:10.422
so I wanted to tell
you this in person.

24:10.584 --> 24:13.377
Alan doesn't like the idea
of Tangey doing the music.

24:13.402 --> 24:14.986
What?

24:15.098 --> 24:17.223
Nina, you said this
was a done deal.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.642
The Business Affairs
Department at the studio

24:18.643 --> 24:20.394
has been nickel and
diming me for days.

24:20.395 --> 24:22.563
Yeah, because he doesn't
want her deal to close.

24:22.564 --> 24:23.689
Yeah, well, he
doesn't wanna hear

24:23.690 --> 24:25.357
what I have to say
about that, either.

24:25.358 --> 24:27.443
The sad thing, it's not
even about creative.

24:27.444 --> 24:28.945
Alan thinks Tangey's
a great singer.

24:28.970 --> 24:31.055
He's just a cheap bastard.

24:31.056 --> 24:33.641
Well, what, does he want my
daughter to do it for free?

24:35.936 --> 24:38.396
Connect me with Alan
Mill's office, please.

24:41.650 --> 24:43.025
Wait a minute.

24:43.026 --> 24:45.321
That's how we can pull this off.

24:45.346 --> 24:46.862
Oh, this is brilliant.

24:46.863 --> 24:48.740
No, no, don't leave a message.

24:50.951 --> 24:53.012
Okay, I see the wheels turnin'

24:53.037 --> 24:54.620
but your lips aren't movin'.

24:54.621 --> 24:56.622
You want your daughter to
be a triple threat, right?

24:56.623 --> 24:58.832
I thought the movie was cast.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.575
There might be a
role opening up.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.836
If you can make
that happen, Nina

25:02.837 --> 25:05.339
Tangey will do the
movie for scale.

25:05.340 --> 25:06.632
Well, Alan's not gonna
let her do the movie

25:06.633 --> 25:07.758
if we can't work
out a deal on...

25:07.759 --> 25:10.176
Oh-oh, wait, then
we'll reduce her fee

25:10.201 --> 25:11.637
for the music, too.

25:11.638 --> 25:13.806
Let me see what I can do.

25:13.807 --> 25:17.143
Alright, Ms. Nina.
Then I owe you one.

25:23.608 --> 25:24.900
Jake, how'd the pitch go?

25:24.901 --> 25:27.486
Tell me everything and
start at the beginning.

25:27.487 --> 25:29.738
The beginning? Oh, the
beginning was awful.

25:29.739 --> 25:31.949
And then it only got
worse from there.

25:31.950 --> 25:33.785
It's my fault, though.

25:34.119 --> 25:35.536
I thought I was prepared

25:35.537 --> 25:38.246
and then they asked me to
present a detailed budget.

25:38.388 --> 25:39.639
And I had nothing.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.768
I'm sure it was not as
bad as you think...

25:41.793 --> 25:43.795
Trust me, I'm not
getting the grant.

25:48.842 --> 25:51.320
Well, there's always next year.

25:52.762 --> 25:56.348
Cassie, I can't afford the
five-year plan, remember?

25:56.349 --> 25:58.100
So finance your
movie another way.

25:58.101 --> 26:00.265
It's not that easy.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.813
Jake, you have a real agent
interested in your work

26:02.814 --> 26:05.360
and you're not even
out of school yet.

26:05.775 --> 26:07.727
He threw my script away.

26:07.752 --> 26:09.737
- I saw it in the trash.
- What?

26:09.738 --> 26:12.781
That lying, no-good bastard!

26:12.782 --> 26:14.616
I mean, even Alexis
Glenn blew me off.

26:14.617 --> 26:16.118
But I shouldn't be
surprised, though

26:16.119 --> 26:17.453
'cause she's a movie star.

26:17.454 --> 26:19.246
Wait. When did you
talk to Alexis Glenn?

26:19.247 --> 26:20.622
At the party.

26:20.623 --> 26:22.124
She said she'd give my
script to her agent

26:22.125 --> 26:24.460
but she was probably drunk
'cause she never called back.

26:25.705 --> 26:27.713
I'm sorry.

26:27.714 --> 26:29.131
You know, a practical guy

26:29.132 --> 26:31.437
would probably switch his
major right about now.

26:31.462 --> 26:33.595
Yeah, but you're not practical.

26:34.383 --> 26:35.721
Are you?

26:35.722 --> 26:38.484
I have to do it now if I
wanna graduate on time.

26:38.509 --> 26:41.226
I mean, journalism's cool. I-I
could still write at least...

26:41.227 --> 26:43.854
Jake Salt, snap out of it.

26:43.855 --> 26:45.439
You have dreamed
of making movies

26:45.440 --> 26:47.149
since you were seven years old

26:47.150 --> 26:49.818
when you shot that Harry Potter
short on your dad's flip phone.

26:49.819 --> 26:51.820
But I almost burned
down our garage

26:51.821 --> 26:53.822
when I blew up Hogwarts, so...

26:58.828 --> 27:00.037
Can I help?

27:00.038 --> 27:01.205
Not unless you can tell me

27:01.206 --> 27:02.748
the expected gross earnings

27:02.749 --> 27:05.084
of all the companies
that had IPOs this year.

27:05.085 --> 27:07.795
- IPOs?
- Never mind.

27:10.006 --> 27:12.633
Uh, uh, yeah, hold, hold
on one, one second.

27:12.634 --> 27:15.052
I really need to take this.

27:15.077 --> 27:16.845
Hey, Cassie, what's up?

27:16.846 --> 27:18.722
<i>Jake's switching majors.</i>

27:18.723 --> 27:20.516
What? He didn't get the grant?

27:20.517 --> 27:22.267
Nope. He tanked it.
Totally bombed.

27:22.268 --> 27:24.144
Plus, your agent threw
his script in the trash

27:24.145 --> 27:26.355
<i>and Alexis Glenn flaked on him.</i>

27:26.356 --> 27:28.472
Wait. Hold on. Back that up.

27:28.497 --> 27:30.540
Jake saw it in the trash.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.900
Uh, I-I'll deal with that later.
What did you say about Alexis?

27:33.925 --> 27:35.593
I-I don't know, they-they
met at the party

27:35.618 --> 27:38.308
then she offered to help him
with the script, then ghosted.

27:39.035 --> 27:41.576
Oh, my God.

27:41.639 --> 27:44.014
I think I did a
really bad thing.

27:44.642 --> 27:46.726
Alexis did call him.

27:46.727 --> 27:50.438
He just doesn't know because I
answered the phone in Spanish.

27:50.439 --> 27:52.607
<i>Wait. You did what?</i>

27:52.608 --> 27:55.401
- Oh. I gotta tell him.
- <i>Maybe not.</i>

27:55.402 --> 27:58.738
Maybe you could get her to call
him again, like, as a favor?

27:58.739 --> 28:00.239
Have you met Alexis?

28:00.240 --> 28:02.033
He's changing his
major tomorrow.

28:02.034 --> 28:03.701
So you need to fix this tonight.

28:03.702 --> 28:06.120
Oh. Okay, okay, okay. Bye.

28:10.584 --> 28:13.586
Hideous. Ugly.

28:13.587 --> 28:14.940
No.

28:15.673 --> 28:18.383
Hard no. Heinous.

28:18.384 --> 28:20.802
Hey, Alexis.

28:20.803 --> 28:23.721
Um, do you by any
chance remember

28:23.722 --> 28:25.765
calling my friend, Jake

28:25.766 --> 28:28.267
and hearing somebody curse
you out in Spanish?

28:28.268 --> 28:29.936
Maybe. Why?

28:29.937 --> 28:31.062
Well, uh...

28:32.648 --> 28:34.190
I'm not proud of this

28:34.191 --> 28:37.639
but, uh, <i>soy ella.</i>

28:38.904 --> 28:40.947
You naughty little <i>senorita.</i>

28:40.948 --> 28:43.324
If you're mad at me,
I'm fine with that

28:43.325 --> 28:47.704
but would you consider maybe
calling him back again?

28:47.705 --> 28:49.747
- Seriously?
- I mean, I'll...

28:49.748 --> 28:51.120
I'll do anything you want.

Hey, uh, Alexis

29:57.673 --> 30:00.321
did you, um, get a
chance to call him?

30:00.346 --> 30:03.821
What? You didn't think it would
take just one favor, did you?

30:03.822 --> 30:06.740
Uh, okay, fine. What...

30:06.765 --> 30:08.808
what else can I do for you?

30:10.078 --> 30:13.197
Well, these stilettos
are killing me

30:13.222 --> 30:15.458
and we're gonna be here late.

30:15.459 --> 30:18.419
I think I have a pair
of slippers in my car.

30:18.420 --> 30:22.220
And you want me to get them?

30:22.245 --> 30:25.510
Oh. That would be awesome.

30:25.511 --> 30:29.138
Uh, okay. Uh, where
are you parked?

30:29.139 --> 30:31.066

on the other side of the lot?

30:35.308 --> 30:37.438
It's a Mercedes SLK.

30:37.439 --> 30:39.024
Don't ding the doors.

30:50.536 --> 30:52.203
Here's your new budget.

30:52.204 --> 30:55.249
It's three million lighter
and Tangey's closed.

30:57.334 --> 30:59.167
How did you do that?

30:59.192 --> 31:00.776
You're welcome.

31:07.594 --> 31:09.762
You backstabbing bitch!

31:09.763 --> 31:11.462
You didn't want people
finding out about us

31:11.487 --> 31:12.890
so you made sure that
wouldn't happen.

31:12.891 --> 31:15.286
- What are you talking about?
- You got me fired!

31:15.311 --> 31:17.645
- What did you do?
- Nothing! I swear.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.088
Oh, so it's just a coincidence

31:19.089 --> 31:21.298
that I'm being replaced
by your best friend?

31:21.299 --> 31:22.716
Tangey? She doesn't even act.

31:22.717 --> 31:25.135
With your history, I have
no reason to believe you.

31:25.136 --> 31:27.931
Rach, please, can we
talk about this tonight?

31:34.211 --> 31:36.688
Gorgeous, guys. Just a few more.

31:41.069 --> 31:43.195
You took my 3/2 wetsuit?

31:43.196 --> 31:44.489
I don't have it.

31:45.648 --> 31:47.449
Then why can't I find it?

31:47.450 --> 31:48.951
Maybe the housekeeper
moved it somewhere

31:48.952 --> 31:51.250
when she was cleaning up
after your sorry ass.

31:51.555 --> 31:53.723
- You know what I think?
- Enlighten me.

31:53.724 --> 31:56.059
Like everything else in my
life, you probably stole it.

31:58.020 --> 32:00.479
Look, I didn't steal your stupid
wetsuit or your girlfriend...

32:17.706 --> 32:19.165
Hey, Rachel

32:19.166 --> 32:22.044
I got your favorite,
Singapore noodles.

32:34.266 --> 32:36.180
_

32:57.454 --> 32:59.413
You almost missed our deadline.

32:59.414 --> 33:01.457
It wasn't easy gettin' this
much cash on short notice.

33:01.458 --> 33:04.411
- But you did, right?
- Twenty five.

33:04.497 --> 33:06.922
That wasn't our deal.
I want fifty.

33:08.048 --> 33:10.083
Of course, you do.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.676
- Nina, what are you...
- Who is this bitch?

33:12.677 --> 33:14.930
I'm the bitch with the other 25.

33:16.014 --> 33:17.848
Take your money and
get out of here.

33:18.317 --> 33:20.351
And if you ever bother him again

33:20.352 --> 33:22.354
you'll be dealing with me.

33:31.446 --> 33:34.115
- What if she comes back for more?
- Don't worry.

33:34.116 --> 33:37.034
I think this is the last we'll
be seeing of your mother.

33:48.713 --> 33:50.382
What the hell?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.389
Is there a problem, Officer?

33:58.390 --> 34:00.141
Got a report of someone
swerving in traffic

34:00.142 --> 34:01.517
that matches your
vehicle's description.

34:01.518 --> 34:03.102
What? No, I-I wasn't swerving.

34:06.267 --> 34:08.435
Could you please hand
me that satchel, ma'am?

34:08.460 --> 34:10.359
- What for?
- Ma'am!

34:19.369 --> 34:22.089
Last I checked, there was no
law against having money.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.168
What? That's not mine!

34:27.168 --> 34:28.585
Ma'am, step out of
the car, please.

34:28.587 --> 34:29.795
I'm telling you that's not mine!

34:29.795 --> 34:32.214
Ma'am, step out of the
car, please, ma'am.

34:32.215 --> 34:33.716
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

34:33.717 --> 34:35.551
<i>Anything you say can and
will be held against you</i>

34:35.552 --> 34:38.013
<i>in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney...</i>

34:45.329 --> 34:47.405
Hey, uh...

34:47.813 --> 34:49.389
You're up early.

34:49.414 --> 34:50.998
I got good news.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.649
Alexis Glenn called me.

34:53.904 --> 34:56.114
- She did?
- Yeah.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.494
And she told me everything.

35:02.008 --> 35:04.731
Why didn't you tell me she
called the first time?

35:05.207 --> 35:06.665
I'm sorry

35:06.666 --> 35:09.906
but Alexis...

35:09.931 --> 35:12.517
she's not a nice person.

35:13.882 --> 35:16.476
And she's never gonna help you.

35:16.501 --> 35:18.594
Her agents liked the script
and they want to rep me.

35:18.595 --> 35:20.285
What?

35:20.472 --> 35:22.098
Oh, my God.

35:23.043 --> 35:24.725
That's awesome! Congrats...

35:24.726 --> 35:26.185
I don't understand what's
going on with you.

35:26.186 --> 35:27.478
Ever since you got
cast in this film

35:27.479 --> 35:29.522
you're like a different person.

35:29.523 --> 35:32.775
Come on, that's not
fair and it's not true.

35:32.776 --> 35:35.611
Before all this, you never would
have done something like that.

35:35.612 --> 35:37.404
Paige, we're supposed to
look out for each other.

35:37.405 --> 35:39.073
- We do.
- Really?

35:39.074 --> 35:42.034
Because right now it
doesn't feel like that.

35:42.035 --> 35:44.454
Why are we using
our inside voices?

35:46.915 --> 35:50.210
Oh. You found out about the...

35:50.904 --> 35:52.475
You knew, too?

35:55.298 --> 35:56.299
<i>Um...</i>

35:57.926 --> 35:59.095
Uh...

36:15.625 --> 36:16.999
_

36:21.855 --> 36:24.293
_

36:36.878 --> 36:39.088
- <i>Rainer?</i>
- For you.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.888
- What's this?
- Open it.

36:52.685 --> 36:55.402
<i>Oh, the dress from
the photo shoot?</i>

36:57.386 --> 36:59.220
Francine's a family friend.

36:59.245 --> 37:02.916
I mean, it's gorgeous, but..

37:04.113 --> 37:06.490
- Why?
- Uh...

37:06.491 --> 37:08.951
I'm sorry for the way I
acted at the photo shoot.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.661
Thanks.

37:11.662 --> 37:14.451
But I think the person you
should be apologizing to

37:14.476 --> 37:16.103
is Jordan.

37:18.211 --> 37:21.979
Uh, it's, uh, it's complicated.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.091
We used to be like family.

37:25.652 --> 37:28.112
Look, I'm not gonna pretend like

37:28.137 --> 37:30.096
I know what you're going through

37:30.097 --> 37:32.849
but... if you have a friend

37:32.850 --> 37:35.852
that you consider like family

37:35.853 --> 37:38.370
they're worth giving
a second chance to.

37:39.232 --> 37:42.317
At least that's what I
hope my friend would do.

37:42.318 --> 37:44.110
Who's mad at you?

37:44.111 --> 37:47.871
It's a very long story.

37:53.287 --> 37:55.247
I'm sorry about you and Jordan.

37:55.248 --> 37:56.998
I really hope you
guys work it out.

37:56.999 --> 37:59.000
Yeah.

37:59.001 --> 38:02.254
So what's going on with the paper?
Did you get it done?

38:03.443 --> 38:05.073
No, um...

38:06.509 --> 38:08.343
Your mom was right.

38:08.344 --> 38:10.345
I really can't do
school and the movie.

38:10.346 --> 38:12.305
You're sure about that?

38:12.306 --> 38:13.682
When I was 14

38:13.683 --> 38:16.935
I really wanted to do
this summer baseball camp

38:16.936 --> 38:18.353
with the Dodgers

38:18.354 --> 38:21.189
but I was on "Backsplash"
and we were shooting.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.483
So no camping with the Dodgers?

38:23.484 --> 38:26.695
Actually, I told my mom
how much it meant to me

38:26.696 --> 38:29.239
and I offered her a
doable compromise.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.741
You sound like a producer.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.660
I'm a producer's son.

38:33.661 --> 38:35.881
I know how she thinks.

38:36.235 --> 38:40.390
You got to give her a
solution, not a problem.

38:44.380 --> 38:48.049
So, uh, what's my solution?

38:48.074 --> 38:50.530
Let her know how much
it means to you.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.306
I'm staying in school.

38:54.307 --> 38:56.224
- We've had this discussion.
- Yes, I know.

38:56.225 --> 38:58.768
And I've done everything
everybody's asked me to do, Nina

38:58.769 --> 39:01.187
but I can't physically be
in two places at once.

39:01.188 --> 39:03.649
So I rearranged my
courses for the semester

39:03.674 --> 39:05.900
and the key is my statistics
class on Wednesday.

39:05.901 --> 39:07.464
- We shoot all week.
- I know that.

39:07.489 --> 39:09.863
But I've rearranged my
whole entire schedule

39:09.864 --> 39:11.364
around this one day.

39:11.365 --> 39:14.075
That's all I need from
you to make it work.

39:14.076 --> 39:16.703
When you were cast in this
film, we entered an agreement.

39:16.704 --> 39:20.248
Yes, but, Nina, school
means the world to me.

39:20.249 --> 39:22.667
And I've also entered an
agreement with my parents

39:22.668 --> 39:24.711
and it will break my
dad's heart if I quit.

39:24.712 --> 39:26.421
<i>So that's not an option.</i>

39:26.422 --> 39:28.548
All I need from you to
make things work, Nina

39:28.549 --> 39:31.302
is this one day.

39:32.553 --> 39:34.846
What do I get in exchange?

39:34.847 --> 39:37.265
Me, a 110% every day

39:37.266 --> 39:39.643
busting my ass for you, on time.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.934
Whatever you want
August to be...

39:42.959 --> 39:44.301
it'll be me.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.021
Then we have a deal.

39:57.286 --> 39:59.490
<i>Hey.</i>

40:00.998 --> 40:02.607
Got your message.

40:05.711 --> 40:07.838
I found that wetsuit
in the garage.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.592
Can I borrow it?

40:15.096 --> 40:16.649
Maybe.

40:26.982 --> 40:29.819
- Look, bro, I really am...
- It's over. Okay?

40:32.405 --> 40:34.023
Let's just move on.

40:40.788 --> 40:43.248
Big south swell
filling in today.

40:43.249 --> 40:46.771

You know, it's a 103 degrees
in the desert at night?

41:15.823 --> 41:19.075
Seriously? I-I had no idea.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.994
Ha. Stick with me.

41:20.995 --> 41:22.912
I can teach you all
kinds of things.

41:22.913 --> 41:26.166

something about Hollywood, too.
