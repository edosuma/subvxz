00:47.972 --> 00:52.013
Kent. It's a farm.
Do they even have addresses?

00:55.870 --> 01:01.331
Look, the last super genius I had on the line
told me to turn right on route 31.

01:01.397 --> 01:03.934
Now I'm totally lost.

01:04.269 --> 01:07.298
Oh, about a billion stalks of corn.

01:11.587 --> 01:13.841
That's just great.

01:17.928 --> 01:19.768
Okay, if you smoke this,
you are going to spend

01:19.774 --> 01:22.585
the rest of the night
hating yourself.

02:17.123 --> 02:18.496
Oh, my god.

02:31.377 --> 02:33.374
Are you... are you okay?

02:36.595 --> 02:38.130
What's your name?

02:39.503 --> 02:41.093
I don't know.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.059
I need to get you to a hospital.

02:44.216 --> 02:45.932
I am fine.

02:47.741 --> 02:49.607
You've just been hit by lightning,

02:49.670 --> 02:53.664
you're stark naked, and, uh, and you
don't even remember your own name.

02:53.727 --> 02:57.097
You have a fairly loose definition of "fine."

02:59.313 --> 03:01.528
Look at his face.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.947
I have a blanket in the trunk.

03:09.073 --> 03:11.475
Don't move. I'll be right back.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.191
Wait.

03:14.659 --> 03:16.375
Who are you?

03:17.498 --> 03:18.834
Lois.

05:18.037 --> 05:19.960
Try and keep up.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.790
Why are we here?

05:22.163 --> 05:25.153
- To get you checked out.
- I am fine.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.516
Do you know how many people are struck
by lightning every year? Hardly any.

05:28.591 --> 05:30.616
You know how many survive? Even less.

05:30.675 --> 05:33.644
And the number who get
picked up by lost drivers? Zero.

05:33.684 --> 05:35.799
So far you're 3-for-3, so
how about a little less

05:35.805 --> 05:38.008
complaining and a little
more forward motion?

05:38.169 --> 05:41.913
Excuse me. Got a guy here
who needs immediate attention.

05:42.582 --> 05:45.585
Fill out these admission forms
and include proof of insurance.

05:45.590 --> 05:46.637
Slight problem...

05:46.713 --> 05:48.931
I don't know who he is, and...

05:49.010 --> 05:50.248
neither does he.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.667
He's got amnesia. So,
I'm turning him over to you.

05:53.824 --> 05:55.633
You can keep the blanket.

05:57.007 --> 05:58.364
Whoa, whoa,

05:58.600 --> 06:01.033
does this look like an animal shelter?

06:01.825 --> 06:04.971
Now, you have to stay with him until
we find someone who can I.D. Him.

06:05.050 --> 06:06.914
It's hospital policy.

06:07.249 --> 06:08.429
Look,

06:08.547 --> 06:11.772
I did the good Samaritan thing,
but I can't be responsible for this guy.

06:11.832 --> 06:13.440
You already are.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.115
Now I have to call a deputy to get your statement.

06:23.158 --> 06:26.428
I think you might want to
get him some clothes first.

06:48.322 --> 06:50.890
<i>Merci</i>.

07:00.868 --> 07:02.575
Ooh, sorry.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.940
- You're American, right?
- Yes.

07:05.372 --> 07:07.083
Great. Can I ask you a big favor?

07:07.122 --> 07:09.443
Sure... as long as it doesn't get me arrested.

07:09.507 --> 07:11.925
No, I'm supposed to meet
my girlfriend here.

07:11.945 --> 07:13.755
Well, she's not really
my girlfriend...

07:13.775 --> 07:15.642
even though we spend
every waking moment together.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.310
See, we met two months ago today
on this exact street corner,

07:18.336 --> 07:19.491
and I bought her something
to mark the occasion.

07:19.498 --> 07:20.835
I wanted to get
your opinion.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.339
All right.

07:29.085 --> 07:31.331
Well, uh, I think that
would probably be

07:31.357 --> 07:33.492
the last thing she
would be expecting.

07:33.526 --> 07:35.728
It doesn't really scream "romance," does it?

07:35.867 --> 07:38.443
But, see, the first time we met,
I was driving by on my vespa,

07:38.469 --> 07:41.044
and I clipped her. She thought I
was going to steal her purse.

07:41.079 --> 07:42.667
So she kicked me off my bike,

07:42.747 --> 07:44.409
I messed up an old football
injury, and then she spent

07:44.425 --> 07:46.625
five hours with me at the
hospital, and we just clicked.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.980
Well, it sounds like love at first crash.

07:49.079 --> 07:53.244
Yeah. Well, for me it was, anyway,
but I'm just an impulsive kind of guy.

07:53.304 --> 07:54.896
Well, how does she feel?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.439
I don't know. She doesn't really
talk about it. I think she.. uh..

07:57.499 --> 08:01.570
She got hurt by somebody, but...
maybe she needs to talk about it.

08:03.875 --> 08:07.710
Well, nothing says "I love you"
like a motorcycle helmet.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.521
Yeah,

08:10.601 --> 08:13.586
it's for a weekend trip to nice... if she's...

08:13.842 --> 08:15.395
if she's interested.

08:16.851 --> 08:20.784
If a guy did something that romantic for me,

08:20.863 --> 08:23.216
- I think I'd have to kiss him.
- Yeah?

08:23.255 --> 08:24.474
Yeah.

08:31.827 --> 08:34.559
I'd love to go to nice with you, Jason.

08:34.595 --> 08:37.270
Happy anniversary, Lana.

08:42.561 --> 08:45.078
<i>"After breakfast, I wanted
to talk about the dead man</i>

08:45.157 --> 08:48.146

But Jim didn't want to.</i>

Huck Finn.

08:56.197 --> 08:58.203
Jonathan's favorite.

08:59.847 --> 09:03.254
Martha, I wanted to know
if you thought about what we discussed.

09:03.284 --> 09:06.038
I'm not pulling the plug on my husband.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.541
It's been three months,
and there's been no change.

09:13.704 --> 09:15.592
Jonathan is brain-dead.

09:15.652 --> 09:18.119
Your insurance is already capped out.

09:18.226 --> 09:20.011
You need to think about the future.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.848
My future is lying in that bed.

09:22.927 --> 09:25.109
I will not give upon him.

09:45.579 --> 09:46.641
Okay,

09:46.701 --> 09:49.300
we need to stay in the room.
I'm not supposed to be here.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.941
Yeah, well,

09:51.472 --> 09:53.459
that makes two of us.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.767
Stay. Good.

09:57.693 --> 10:00.053
I came to Smallville to investigate
my cousin's death.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.726
Her name was Chloe Sullivan.
Heard of her?

10:04.143 --> 10:05.987
Of course you haven't.

10:08.919 --> 10:10.079
Nicorette.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.030
I've given up smoking.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.475
These are the only things
that get me through the day.

10:13.557 --> 10:16.172
It started when I was 15.
It's my father's fault. He said if he

10:16.232 --> 10:18.474
ever caught me smoking, he'd
kill me, so in a fit of

10:18.500 --> 10:20.716
teenage rebellion... I
started, then I couldn't stop.

10:20.755 --> 10:22.721
Now I've got a gum addiction.

10:23.204 --> 10:24.525
You talk a lot.

10:24.564 --> 10:27.576
Well, I'm just not very comfortable
with uncomfortable silence, and

10:27.602 --> 10:30.481
you're not exactly keeping up with
your end of the conversation.

10:37.351 --> 10:39.750
45 minutes, and still no doctor?

10:39.829 --> 10:41.501
You know, if this
isn't an indictment

10:41.527 --> 10:43.551
of small town medicine,
I don't know what is.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.007
Whoa!

10:45.031 --> 10:46.408
Where are you going?

10:46.449 --> 10:47.707
I'm leaving.

10:48.475 --> 10:51.228
Well, you're gonna have to get through me first.

11:05.635 --> 11:06.756
Hey!

11:10.462 --> 11:11.976
Wait! Wait!

11:12.468 --> 11:13.963
Wait, Clark!

11:14.278 --> 11:15.556
Okay, stop!

11:15.596 --> 11:17.307
What was that?

11:18.920 --> 11:21.693
It is you! I can't believe it!

11:21.732 --> 11:24.032
I thought I'd lost you forever.

11:24.092 --> 11:25.547
Who are you?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.009
It's me mom.

11:32.184 --> 11:35.173
Don't take it personally. He doesn't
even remember his own name.

11:35.232 --> 11:36.392
Lois Lane.

11:36.609 --> 11:39.027
I found him lying in a field near route 31.

11:39.084 --> 11:40.695
Thank you for helping him.

11:40.755 --> 11:43.902
Guess I'm a sucker for stray dogs and naked guys.

11:45.397 --> 11:47.560
Okay, that didn't come out right.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.270
It's been a long night,
and I am nicotine deprived.

11:50.329 --> 11:52.748
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's get you home.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.852
I'm waiting for the sign.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.222
I think you should have a
doctor take a look at him.

11:57.228 --> 11:59.133
I'm starting to think the
lightning fried his brain.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.373
Um... Lois?

12:01.653 --> 12:03.442
I'm so grateful, but...

12:03.531 --> 12:05.595
this is a family matter.

12:05.654 --> 12:06.632
Okay.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.170
Here's me backing away.

12:11.668 --> 12:15.896
I don't know what's going on, but you need
to come home with me right now.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.145
I can help you find the sign,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.330
but I need to get you out of here, okay?

12:25.449 --> 12:26.703
Come on.

12:32.171 --> 12:35.746
I passed amnesia boy off to his mother.
I didn't catch her name.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.818
Yeah, Martha Kent. She's in here all the time.

12:39.897 --> 12:41.190
Kent?

12:42.175 --> 12:43.905
As in Clark Kent?

12:43.984 --> 12:46.166
Wait a minute! I have to talk to...

12:46.953 --> 12:48.330
you.

13:03.934 --> 13:06.863
Heat too much for you, Mr. Luthor?

13:06.943 --> 13:09.577
I don't want any record that I was here.

13:16.364 --> 13:18.251
Bury everything.

13:28.065 --> 13:31.348
We will be like footprints in the sand.

13:56.975 --> 13:58.509
You're two hours late.

13:58.549 --> 14:00.830
I'm well aware of my tardiness, doctor.

14:00.889 --> 14:02.679
But some things are worse the risk.

14:02.739 --> 14:04.764
What's more important than your life?

14:04.882 --> 14:06.274
The truth.

14:06.452 --> 14:09.295
Your body survived a
massive chemical onslaught

14:09.321 --> 14:11.545
that would've killed
99.9% of people.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.102
That in itself is a miracle.

14:14.181 --> 14:16.096
Spare me the lecture.

14:16.597 --> 14:20.167
I told you, if your blood
isn't purified every 72 hours,

14:20.193 --> 14:23.977
your internal organs
will start to shut down.

14:25.247 --> 14:27.803
You're living on borrowed time, Lex.

14:29.691 --> 14:31.618
Stop trying to borrow more.

14:47.549 --> 14:49.100
What is this place?

14:49.152 --> 14:52.101
Well, your dad calls it
your fortress of solitude.

14:52.181 --> 14:55.484
It's where you come
to think and look at the stars.

15:03.404 --> 15:05.606
Well, here's some pictures.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.926
Maybe they'll jog your memory.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.846
Who are these people?

15:14.358 --> 15:16.088
People who love you.

15:17.740 --> 15:20.719
Do you remember anything
about where you were

15:20.745 --> 15:23.076
before you showed
up in that field?

15:24.552 --> 15:26.853
I was in a place that felt like home.

15:26.894 --> 15:28.663
No, Clark,

15:29.174 --> 15:31.136
this is your home.

15:37.706 --> 15:39.908
- I recognize this man.
- Good.

15:40.626 --> 15:43.025
That's your dad.
You're starting to remember.

15:43.085 --> 15:45.799
He's not my father. He tried to
prevent me from being reborn.

15:45.858 --> 15:47.348
No, Clark.

15:47.487 --> 15:51.872
He loves you, He tried
to save you from Jor-El.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.392
Either way, he's dead.

16:13.311 --> 16:15.061
Better buckle up, Dr. Vaughn.

16:15.149 --> 16:16.663
We're about to hit some turbulence.

16:20.201 --> 16:20.810
Oh, no!

16:20.870 --> 16:24.075
Lex, no, wait! I'll get it for you!
I'll get it for you! Sit down!

16:56.230 --> 16:58.472
I am Kal-El of Krypton.

16:59.161 --> 17:01.451
It is time to fulfill my destiny.

17:02.366 --> 17:03.895
Destiny?

17:04.053 --> 17:06.117
That's Jor-El talking!

17:06.157 --> 17:08.301
He did this to you!

17:08.359 --> 17:11.699
I want my son back! Give me my son back!

17:11.759 --> 17:13.922
Clark Kent is dead.

17:59.773 --> 18:03.861
Jason, stop it. We are in a church,
and I have an art history project to finish.

18:03.901 --> 18:06.457
Okay, when my girlfriend invites
me to some old crypt for some

18:06.483 --> 18:08.876
brass rubbing, I thought that
was code for something else.

18:08.911 --> 18:10.838
Mr. Teague, you have a dirty mind.

18:10.898 --> 18:12.884
But I have a pure heart.

18:14.914 --> 18:16.588
Wait, wait,

18:16.664 --> 18:19.005
Come on, I've already scoped out our victim.

18:20.843 --> 18:22.412
Meet your art project

18:22.461 --> 18:25.528
countess Margaret Isabelle Theroux.

18:25.922 --> 18:29.398
It says here she was a warrior princess who...

18:29.463 --> 18:32.397
kicked a lot of ass and broke a lot of hearts.

18:32.613 --> 18:35.347
Is that a direct translation?

18:35.780 --> 18:37.880
No, I just... I figured you
guys had a lot in common.

18:37.887 --> 18:40.733
You know, you're both, uh,
you're both strong and, uh,

18:40.984 --> 18:44.327
both uncompromising. Both beautiful.

18:45.782 --> 18:47.650
We should get to work.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.499
- The church closes in an hour.
- Not me.

18:49.534 --> 18:51.875
I have a hot date to plan for tomorrow.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.182
Somebody failed to mention it was their birthday.

18:56.241 --> 18:57.672
Who told you?

18:57.751 --> 18:59.796
Sources at the highest level of government.

19:00.505 --> 19:03.002
All right, I slipped
the admissions clerk 20 euros.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.318
Look, Jason, I don't expect

19:06.066 --> 19:07.953
stop talking. Start rubbing.

19:07.993 --> 19:09.075
By the way,

19:09.115 --> 19:13.736
festivities begin at 10 a.m. tomorrow
at the <i>Cafe de Fleurie</i>.

19:16.513 --> 19:17.692
All right.

19:19.637 --> 19:20.619
Okay.

20:27.790 --> 20:32.825
No, it can't wait a couple of days.
I need to speak with him now.

20:33.234 --> 20:34.393
Look, just

20:34.453 --> 20:37.934
tell him it's regarding my son Clark Kent.

20:38.031 --> 20:39.348
Hey.

20:40.013 --> 20:42.687
I tried calling earlier,
but I kept getting a busy signal.

20:42.746 --> 20:45.115
I don't know how you survive without call waiting.

20:45.351 --> 20:46.727
Where's Clark?

20:48.223 --> 20:49.560
Upstairs.

20:49.619 --> 20:50.366
Great.

20:50.406 --> 20:52.037
Um... sleeping.

20:53.730 --> 20:57.439
Is that fresh coffee?
I have been waiting for a cup all day.

20:57.498 --> 21:00.723
I can't believe this is the town
that Starbucks forgot.

21:01.432 --> 21:05.266
I heard the only decent
coffee shop in town shut down.

21:05.424 --> 21:06.860
The falcon or something?

21:06.900 --> 21:10.932
Uh, Lois, I really appreciate
everything you did for Clark, and

21:10.971 --> 21:12.799
I don't mean to be rude, but

21:13.193 --> 21:14.334
look,

21:14.885 --> 21:17.556
I didn't come here fishing for thanks.

21:17.752 --> 21:21.664
I think Clark might know something
about my cousin Chloe's death.

21:21.902 --> 21:25.068
I'm so sorry for your loss.

21:25.607 --> 21:26.904
Yeah.

21:27.928 --> 21:30.051
Were she and Clark ever an item?

21:30.091 --> 21:31.503
Uh, I think for
a minute, but...

21:32.129 --> 21:34.694
that's funny. I never thought
she'd fall for the farm boy type.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.948
Trust me, that can happen to the best of us.

21:36.980 --> 21:39.995
Not me. Give me a nerd with
glasses any day of the week.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.671
Clark has many sides.

21:43.044 --> 21:46.190
Yeah, I've seen several of them already.
Speaking of Clark,

21:46.250 --> 21:49.904
- do you think he'll be up any time soon?
- I... I doubt it.

21:55.451 --> 21:59.523
Right now he is my only chance
to get justice for Chloe.

21:59.975 --> 22:02.375
The FBI investigation closed last week.

22:02.434 --> 22:05.227
They've ruled the explosion an accident.

22:05.443 --> 22:09.060
I mean, how many gas leaks
do you know of in safe houses?

22:09.808 --> 22:13.525
And in two weeks,
Lionel Luthor is going to walk free.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.142
And Chloe's death...

22:19.048 --> 22:21.270
it will have been for nothing.

22:22.525 --> 22:26.379
I'll have Clark call you
if he remembers anything.

22:29.094 --> 22:31.060
You know, Chloe said in her notes

22:31.100 --> 22:33.065
that you used to work for Lionel.

22:33.441 --> 22:37.453
And I'm trying to get in to see him,
but he keeps refusing me.

22:37.727 --> 22:39.339
Any advice?

22:39.891 --> 22:41.346
Stay away.

22:41.504 --> 22:44.199
You don't want to get pulled into Lionel's web.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.266
How did you escape unscathed?

22:47.327 --> 22:48.684
I didn't.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.213
Goodbye, Lois.

22:59.534 --> 23:00.596
Bye.

23:17.255 --> 23:18.867
Check this out.

23:19.694 --> 23:21.345
What is it?

23:21.425 --> 23:23.647
A bird, a plane?

24:15.172 --> 24:18.968
I'm afraid that the answers
that you're searching for

24:19.027 --> 24:21.307
won't be found in this barn.

24:23.287 --> 24:27.200
I'm Bridgette Crosby.
Dr. Swann sent me.

24:29.561 --> 24:31.061
You'll have to forgive me.
I was...

24:31.065 --> 24:33.895
You were expecting to speak to Dr.
Swann personally.

24:34.317 --> 24:36.276
The matter I need
to discuss with him

24:36.302 --> 24:38.724
can't exactly be relayed
through someone else.

24:38.757 --> 24:41.432
I can understand your hesitancy,

24:41.491 --> 24:44.023
discussing Kal-El with a complete stranger.

24:44.064 --> 24:47.522
Dr. Swann promised Clark
that no one else knew.

24:47.561 --> 24:50.416
He promised that your son's
secret would not

24:50.435 --> 24:52.872
leave the confines of the
foundation, and it hasn't.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.660
This was a mistake. I never
should've called. I wish that Clark

24:55.665 --> 24:58.350
hadn't contacted Dr.
Swann in the first place.

24:59.591 --> 25:03.131
Your son's destiny was set in motion

25:03.447 --> 25:05.453
long before their paths crossed.

25:05.508 --> 25:09.225
You don't know anything about my son.

25:12.549 --> 25:13.886
You're right.

25:16.028 --> 25:17.620
You're right. I don't.

25:18.939 --> 25:20.990
But I do know what it's
like to love somebody

25:21.016 --> 25:23.794
whose calling is
greater than your own.

25:26.341 --> 25:28.523
You and Dr. Swann?

25:29.488 --> 25:31.592
In a different lifetime.

25:33.706 --> 25:37.706
Martha, I can help you if you'll let me.

25:37.764 --> 25:41.835
- Now, where's your son?
- I don't know.

25:44.864 --> 25:46.551
He flew.

25:46.788 --> 25:48.597
He flew away.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.622
So he's...

25:51.763 --> 25:54.615
he has completely embraced
his Kryptonian destiny.

25:56.326 --> 25:59.020
Do you know what that destiny is?

25:59.135 --> 26:01.022
No, but the symbol

26:01.095 --> 26:03.277
burned into your field three months ago...

26:03.344 --> 26:07.336
that's the Kryptonian symbol for "crusade."

26:07.749 --> 26:10.755
I don't know what Jor-El did to him, but

26:10.833 --> 26:12.956
I know, deep down, Clark is still in there.

26:13.016 --> 26:17.908
Martha, the only challenge to a father's will...

26:18.843 --> 26:21.167
is a mother's love.

26:23.946 --> 26:27.596
I... I can't possibly face Clark alone.

26:29.072 --> 26:31.196
You don't have to. Look.

26:36.017 --> 26:38.495
It's black Kryptonite,

26:40.385 --> 26:42.194
You're his only hope.

26:51.893 --> 26:54.037
Wow, dad, you are in great shape.

26:54.092 --> 26:57.258
Lex, I've been reading about you.

26:57.298 --> 26:59.598
Interesting article.

27:05.884 --> 27:07.674
You know, they, uh,

27:08.500 --> 27:11.351
they dubbed Mussolini a savior.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.440
And look what happened to him.

27:17.955 --> 27:21.809
Dad, if you want to blame someone
for LuthorCorp's woes,

27:21.869 --> 27:23.993
why don't you lookin' the mirror?

27:24.345 --> 27:27.963
A CEO on trial for murder
usually erodes consumer confidence.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.739
Yeah... to go gallivanting around
the world on a fool's errand

27:31.857 --> 27:34.964
ain't gonna win any points
with shareholders, either.

27:36.539 --> 27:38.426
I'm in a cage, Lex.

27:38.486 --> 27:40.197
I'm not dead.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.291
Think I haven't been keeping tabs on you?

27:46.176 --> 27:49.027
- Then how'd you do it?
- Do what?

27:49.205 --> 27:52.233
Break into my jet at 20,000 feet.

27:57.225 --> 27:59.998
You look pale, Lex. Are you all right?

28:02.220 --> 28:03.577
Where is it?

28:05.702 --> 28:08.945
Honestly, Lex, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:08.986 --> 28:11.719
Well, then perhaps I can refresh your memory.

28:11.955 --> 28:13.587
Three artifacts

28:13.844 --> 28:16.480
hidden around the world
by scientifically

28:16.506 --> 28:18.137
advanced ancient cultures

28:18.445 --> 28:20.779
legend has it that, when united, they

28:20.878 --> 28:23.513
they point the way to a
treasury of knowledge

28:23.539 --> 28:26.173
that puts the library
of Alexandria to shame.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.292
You're chasing a fairy tale, Lex.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.582
A fairy tale you believed
in enough to finance

28:38.608 --> 28:40.876
six expeditions over
the last two years.

28:40.933 --> 28:44.980
I funded several educational digs
through the LuthorCorp foundation. So?

28:45.020 --> 28:46.219
So?

28:46.298 --> 28:48.923
So they all focused on
sites that unearthed

28:48.949 --> 28:51.573
the same symbols as
those on the cave wall.

28:57.386 --> 29:01.299
You think those artifacts can save your life, dad?

29:04.664 --> 29:09.954
I don't have time for foolishness, Lex.
I'm about to stand trial for murder.

29:12.157 --> 29:14.816
And when I'm cleared,
those responsible

29:14.830 --> 29:17.162
for putting me here will
certainly feel my wrath.

29:17.201 --> 29:18.696
Like Chloe did?

29:21.141 --> 29:22.907
Chloe Sullivan

29:23.123 --> 29:26.782
was killed in a tragic accident.
She didn't deserve to die.

29:26.821 --> 29:28.295
But I did?

29:29.869 --> 29:32.130
Is that why you poisoned my brandy?

29:32.190 --> 29:34.837
Oh, what kind of a
monster do you think I am?

29:34.863 --> 29:39.236
I lay there for 10 minutes before
the paramedics came, dad, 10 minutes.

29:39.269 --> 29:41.769
They said that dosage would
kill an ordinary man,

29:41.785 --> 29:43.867
but apparently,
I'm not ordinary.

29:44.014 --> 29:45.921
No, you're not.

29:47.004 --> 29:48.635
You're my son.

29:50.091 --> 29:51.522
God help me.

29:55.870 --> 29:58.855
You shouldn't wound
what you can't kill, dad.

31:35.575 --> 31:37.040
What's going on?
You were supposed to

31:37.055 --> 31:39.010
meet me at 10:00. It's now
12:00.Are you okay?

31:41.397 --> 31:42.573
Yeah,

31:42.828 --> 31:44.520
I don't know how I got here.

31:44.855 --> 31:46.625
I must've passed out.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.414
I'll meet you downstairs.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.033
You shouldn't have come here,
Martha Kent.

32:17.188 --> 32:18.151
Clark...

32:20.295 --> 32:23.107
if you're still in there, I love you.

32:48.158 --> 32:50.026
Humanity has made you weak.

32:50.479 --> 32:51.678
Clark!

33:17.669 --> 33:18.829
Clark?

33:21.714 --> 33:23.129
Clark?

33:26.001 --> 33:28.577
It's me, mom. I'm back.

33:51.508 --> 33:53.474
What'd the doctors say?

33:54.871 --> 33:58.273
Well, she said that your father is A...

33:58.313 --> 34:00.752
walking, breathing miracle.

34:02.719 --> 34:04.410
And that's thanks to you.

34:05.098 --> 34:06.927
The real hero's mom.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.466
If it wasn't for her, I'd still be Kal-El.

34:14.692 --> 34:16.186
Son...

34:18.389 --> 34:21.090
do you remember anything
that happened after you...

34:21.149 --> 34:23.194
got pulled into that wall?

34:23.201 --> 34:25.561
I just remember that last couple of days.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.370
Even that's a little jumbled.

34:28.487 --> 34:29.746
Clark...

34:31.596 --> 34:34.132
your mother tells me you...

34:34.349 --> 34:36.060
can fly?

34:37.384 --> 34:39.056
Kal-El can fly.

34:39.547 --> 34:41.670
Clark Kent is still earthbound.

34:43.068 --> 34:44.679
How did that feel?

34:46.922 --> 34:48.987
Amazing.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.318
And scary...

34:53.165 --> 34:56.253
because if I can do that,
maybe I'm capable of anything.

34:56.288 --> 34:57.782
You are.

35:00.319 --> 35:02.167
No, that's you, mom.

35:03.348 --> 35:05.935
Cause I don't know if I would've
had the strength to hold on for

35:05.961 --> 35:09.224
three months, not knowing where I
was and if dad would pull through.

35:10.885 --> 35:13.126
Well, my father used to tell me,

35:13.182 --> 35:16.465
life asks of you what it thinks you can handle.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.652
There were days

35:19.987 --> 35:22.559
when I thought that it had asked too much.

35:22.693 --> 35:24.404
But then I would think about

35:24.444 --> 35:26.646
this family and...

35:27.473 --> 35:29.596
all the things we've endured

35:29.636 --> 35:32.168
and the good things ahead of us.

35:32.748 --> 35:36.721
And I found the strength
to keep going because...

35:37.881 --> 35:41.282
I knew the three of us would be together again.

37:13.076 --> 37:15.022
You're not Martha Kent.

37:15.279 --> 37:18.129
Would you have seen me
if they said it was Lois Lane?

37:18.189 --> 37:20.627
Lois Lane. Yes.

37:24.856 --> 37:27.314
You're Chloe Sullivan's cousin.

37:29.961 --> 37:31.849
What a loss.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.487
You bite your nails. Bad girl.

37:35.725 --> 37:38.611
But getting through the door
doesn't mean I'll talk to you.

37:38.652 --> 37:39.910
Guard?

37:40.815 --> 37:43.980
I don't believe that safe house
explosion was an accident.

37:44.011 --> 37:47.570
Of course you don't.
You believe I'm responsible.

37:47.970 --> 37:49.150
No.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.981
A stunt like that is...

37:52.021 --> 37:54.362
thuggish and obvious.

37:54.755 --> 37:57.055
It smacks of desperation

37:57.941 --> 38:00.426
all the things you aren't.

38:01.272 --> 38:04.458
All right, miss Lane, you have my attention.
What's your theory?

38:04.576 --> 38:06.208
I don't have one.

38:08.097 --> 38:10.078
Then why are you here?

38:11.869 --> 38:14.597
Because I wanted to look
into the face of the son of a bitch

38:14.623 --> 38:17.459
who's responsible for my cousin's death.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.787
You may not have blown her up,

38:22.201 --> 38:24.030
but you're the reason she's gone.

38:24.089 --> 38:26.299
Before you begin to
anoint her for sainthood,

38:26.308 --> 38:30.135
let's get some of the facts
straight, all right?

38:31.235 --> 38:33.201
The simple truth is,

38:33.241 --> 38:35.326
I made her an offer, she took it.

38:35.365 --> 38:38.453
I kept my end of the bargain, she didn't.

38:39.913 --> 38:45.832
She's dead as a result of her own actions.
I had nothing to do with it.

38:46.482 --> 38:48.662
And the next time you come
at me with accusations,

38:48.675 --> 38:53.399
try to have a little more than
righteous indignation.

38:56.760 --> 39:00.202
Zoo hours are over,
miss Lane. Good day.

39:08.111 --> 39:09.487
You know,

39:11.061 --> 39:15.091
it must kill you that
somebody has given you this gift.

39:15.150 --> 39:18.316
And you don't know who
and you don't know why, but

39:18.631 --> 39:21.015
without Chloe's testimony,
you're probably

39:21.041 --> 39:22.981
gonna walk out of
here a free man.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.381
Or are you being set up?

39:52.270 --> 39:54.036
I have a confession to make.

39:54.114 --> 39:55.786
I didn't go to your funeral.

39:56.593 --> 39:58.323
I hate funerals.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.745
Dad says everybody does,

40:03.198 --> 40:07.445
but it's a way of paying
tribute to a life well-led.

40:17.907 --> 40:21.151
I hate myself for being weak.

40:22.514 --> 40:25.523
I just knew that, the moment I came here,

40:25.898 --> 40:27.785
it would make it real.

40:30.244 --> 40:33.296
I promise I'll find out who did this to you...

40:34.350 --> 40:37.103
even if I have to do it alone.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.011
You're not alone.

40:41.558 --> 40:45.648
A fact you could've shared before
you were breathing down my neck.

40:46.002 --> 40:48.677
I'm sorry, Lois. I didn't know you were out here.

40:59.311 --> 41:04.012
Glad to see we've moved beyond the
clothing-optional stage of our relationship.

41:04.425 --> 41:07.100
I'm surprised you even
remember who I am.

41:07.887 --> 41:09.303
Chloe's cousin.

41:10.325 --> 41:14.472
Nicorette addiction,
can't stand uncomfortable silences...

41:14.827 --> 41:18.466
I guess this means your
synapses are all firing again.

41:21.238 --> 41:25.170
Look, I can't
explain my actions over the past few days.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.304
But Chloe was my best friend.

41:30.933 --> 41:33.096
You're not the only one who misses her.

41:33.727 --> 41:36.334
I'm just the only one doing
something about it.

41:37.219 --> 41:40.129
I get the feeling you like to do things yourself.

41:40.543 --> 41:43.316
My dad raised me to be
independent and self-sufficient.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.593
That would be one way to describe you.

41:45.889 --> 41:49.350
You know, the only thing I like about you
at the moment is your mom.

41:49.448 --> 41:53.469
You can't possibly be as weird as I think
you are with a mom that cool.

41:55.338 --> 41:58.445
Look, why don't you let me help,
find out who did this to Chloe?

41:58.505 --> 42:00.923
Come on, you can stay
at our house while you're in town.

42:03.363 --> 42:05.804
It beats living out of your car.

42:09.731 --> 42:10.674
Thanks.

42:11.166 --> 42:13.416
But you should know I
don't pay attention to curfews,

42:13.425 --> 42:15.980
and I never make my bed.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.553
I'll give you some time alone.

42:49.354 --> 42:50.573
Lois!

42:52.836 --> 42:54.763
Chloe's still alive.

42:55.305 --> 43:01.171
