skittered along the
cobblestones,

02:11.432 --> 02:14.833
gunk dripping

02:14.835 --> 02:18.170

No, I'm not!

02:48.202 --> 02:49.535
Yes, I am.

02:49.537 --> 02:53.405

03:01.448 --> 03:06.418
Anyway, The Bloody Hangman
set to his gory work.

03:06.420 --> 03:11.390
Bodies piled up like those
stackable plastic chairs.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.859
Like those chairs

Huh. It's a pigeon.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.842
Aw, the poor guy
hurt his wing.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.844
Hey, there's a
number on him.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.779
What is it?

03:33.781 --> 03:36.014
(gasps) I bet it's a
combination to a safe!

03:36.016 --> 03:40.786
Or, more likely, the phone
number of the bird's owner.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.621
(dialing)

03:42.623 --> 03:43.322
Ask about the safe.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.291
No, better yet, act like you
know about the safe.

03:46.293 --> 03:46.825
MAN:
Hello.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.262
Yes, I believe I have your
pigeon, "Raymond Bird,"

03:50.264 --> 03:51.730
and I need to know how
to return him to you.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.200
He's a homing pigeon, girlie.
Why don't you let him fly home?

03:55.202 --> 03:56.668
Unless you want
to spring for a limo.

03:56.670 --> 04:01.707
Yes, he could fly home, except
that he has a broken wing.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.375
Perhaps you and your sarcasm

04:03.377 --> 04:06.311
could come to Springfield
and retrieve him.

04:06.313 --> 04:06.812
Are you kidding?

04:06.814 --> 04:09.281
Wherever I go, 200 birds gotta
come with me.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.385
And they all want to sit in the
front seat with Daddy.

04:14.521 --> 04:15.420
(dial tone)
(sighs)

04:15.422 --> 04:18.457
Looks like you're going to have
to take care of him, Bart.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.426
Me? Just what in my long,
sad history with frogs

04:21.428 --> 04:23.929
makes you think I can
take care of a bird?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.697
(yelps) No, no...

04:25.699 --> 04:28.133
Listen, don't tell
anyone, but...

04:28.135 --> 04:29.835
I can't stand pigeons!

04:29.837 --> 04:31.603
They're like rats with wings!

04:31.605 --> 04:33.438
He's crawling on your arm.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.072
(gasps)

04:34.074 --> 04:37.776
Oh... Okay, maybe
he's not so bad.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.810
(giggles)
(retches)

04:38.812 --> 04:43.515
Oh! No! No! No! Get off!
Get off! Get off!

05:28.295 --> 05:31.697
Okay, Ray, your wing is healed.
Go on.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.465
Live your life.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.536
Aw, c'mon, man.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.439
Admit it-- you knew this day
would come.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.640
(cooing)

05:57.925 --> 06:00.926
You and I have shared too many
seed bells

06:00.928 --> 06:03.095
to just walk away from this.

06:03.097 --> 06:05.764
(cooing)

06:06.967 --> 06:08.567
Go ahead,
make fun of me.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.469
I lost my heart to a bird.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.803
(half-heartedly):
Haw-haw.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.673
Man, you were not into that.
What's wrong?

06:14.675 --> 06:18.076
My mom ran off
with my birthday clown.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.911
(cooing)

06:22.649 --> 06:25.951
(staples clacking)

06:26.587 --> 06:27.953
All finished, boy.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.755
That coop looks a little flimsy.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.822
(scoffs) Flimsy?

06:30.824 --> 06:34.860
This gentle pat says different.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.433
D'oh!

06:41.435 --> 06:42.667
Now that you're
officially my bird,

06:42.669 --> 06:44.936
let me fill you in on the
pecking order around here.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.840
The top dog is me, followed by
the top dog, the dog...

06:48.842 --> 06:50.142
then the cat and then you...

06:50.144 --> 06:52.444
But don't feel bad.
You're ahead of Milhouse.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.480
C'mon Bart. How long
can you stay mad?

06:55.482 --> 06:58.817
I thought your race car was
a Transformer!

06:58.819 --> 07:01.052
Nothing's one thing anymore!

07:01.054 --> 07:02.587
Sorry, man, it's still too soon.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.457
No problem. I'll just be right
behind this fence,

07:05.459 --> 07:09.027
whenever you're ready
to forgive me.

07:09.596 --> 07:14.032
Now? Do you
forgive me now?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.802
Now? Now?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.071
I'm scared, Bart.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.917
Wow, Ray, you have hidden
talents!

08:05.919 --> 08:06.718
Is he good at tic-tac-toe,

08:06.720 --> 08:10.222
like that chicken I played, lost
to, and ate at the State Fair?

08:10.224 --> 08:11.122
No, I was thinking

08:11.124 --> 08:13.725
we could use him to send
messages back and forth.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.494
Way ahead of you.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.029

08:21.068 --> 08:24.503
Mom, why am I so
repulsed by pigeons?

grizzlies, and...

you know,
I'm not crazy about opossums.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.232

this note

Dearly beloved,
I'd like to open this service

12:58.378 --> 13:00.812
with the words
of Emily Dickinson:

13:00.814 --> 13:03.948
"Hope is the thing

13:03.950 --> 13:05.483
Oh, stupid dog!

13:07.521 --> 13:11.189
(groaning)

13:11.258 --> 13:13.424
This funeral just
got depressing.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.460
Let's lighten up
the mood, boys.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.574
That song does make me
feel a little better.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.976
It's from Bye Bye Birdie.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
(sobbing)

13:40.287 --> 13:42.287
You really don't get it.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.834
Your crimes
against the animals

13:55.836 --> 13:57.268
have gone before the jury.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.003
We probably
should deliberate,

13:59.005 --> 14:01.506
but we're kind
of in a hurry.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.945
I never met a dog
I didn't hate.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.213
(chuckles)

14:10.050 --> 14:11.115
Ah, yes.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.519
A little hair
of the dog that bit me.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.596
I hope you've learned
something here.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.998
(groans)

14:28.468 --> 14:32.871
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Bart
has been very sad lately.

14:32.873 --> 14:33.338
We know.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.573
And we're going to do
something about it.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.175
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.042
Please don't do anything.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.277
Not only have
his grades gone up,

14:39.279 --> 14:42.380
but the enthusiasm has
gone out of his pranks.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.148
I mean, take a look at this.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.216
(Marge groans)

14:45.218 --> 14:46.584
(chuckles) If anything,
I was wondering

14:46.586 --> 14:47.919
if you could make him sadder.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.154
How can you say
a thing like that?

14:50.156 --> 14:53.491
Marge, listen to the man;
he pays Bart's salary.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.392
No, he doesn't.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.628
Why can't you support
my gibberish?

14:56.630 --> 14:58.196
I'd do it if
you were stupid.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.932
Marge, Homer, this marital
discord is perfect.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.502
But please, save it for home
where your son can see it.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.037
(groans):
Oh!

15:06.039 --> 15:08.539
(clock ticking)

15:09.009 --> 15:12.610
Bart, Santa's Little Helper,
come on in.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.280
A shrink that takes
kids and pets?

15:15.282 --> 15:19.017
Hey, in this economy,
I'll even remove tattoos.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.385
Even my tramp stamp?

15:20.387 --> 15:24.555
I got the idea from a show
where people regret these.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.458
Homie, why don't
you study these?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.361
(laughs)

15:31.164 --> 15:34.232
(sobbing)

15:34.968 --> 15:35.600
(gasps)

15:35.602 --> 15:38.069
(frightened whimpering)

15:38.071 --> 15:39.370
Oh, baby.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.239
Well, what do you know!

15:41.241 --> 15:42.674
Oh, come on!

15:43.009 --> 15:45.476
So, Marge, what I understand

15:45.478 --> 15:47.011
from our phone conversation is

15:47.013 --> 15:49.080
you have a very poor
service provider.

15:49.082 --> 15:53.284
I bought it because
Catherine Zeta-Jones told me to.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.086
What a fool I was.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.689
Secondly, there's been
a major breach of trust

15:57.691 --> 16:00.391
between Bart and
Santa's Little Helper.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.960
Well, he shouldn't kill birds.

16:01.962 --> 16:02.427
It's not right.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.996
That is correct,
according to human standards.

16:04.998 --> 16:10.168
But all a dog can do is follow
his animal inclinations, right?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.035
I guess.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.036
So, Bart,

16:12.038 --> 16:14.439
as the one
with the larger brain...

16:14.441 --> 16:15.373
Nicely done, boy.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.243
...maybe you can find it
in your heart to forgive him.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.147
(growling)

16:23.149 --> 16:24.549
See? He's a
questionable character.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.718
He used to hang around
racetracks, you know.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.454
Bart, could you
wait outside?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.390
(growling)

16:35.061 --> 16:36.027
It's not going to work.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.628
You have to give the dog away.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.563
Are you sure?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.999
As sure as I am that
I'll be billing you

16:41.001 --> 16:42.166
for that torn
magazine.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.768
Oh, that's pretty sure.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.303
Subscription rate, right?

16:45.305 --> 16:46.471
Newsstand.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.505
D'oh.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.040
(groans)

16:54.314 --> 16:56.047
Why is it
coming with us?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.682
And for once, I'm not
talking about Lisa.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.052
It's amazing how I can
feel sorry for you

17:01.054 --> 17:02.787
and hate you
at the same time.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.024
I'm sure there's
a German word for it.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.660
We're bringing the dog because
we've found him a new home

17:09.662 --> 17:14.198
at a farm upstate where he can
run and play all day.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.466
You're gonna put him down?

17:15.468 --> 17:19.137
No! For once, a pet
going to a farm upstate

17:19.139 --> 17:22.473
really is going to
a farm upstate.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.641
What about all the other pets

17:23.643 --> 17:25.343
you told us
went to a farm upstate?

17:25.345 --> 17:28.579
Hmm. Backyard, backyard,
toilet, ocean, don't know,

17:28.581 --> 17:33.251
backyard, Flanders' mailbox,
Lenny's freezer, tire fire.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.756
This is where
we're ditching the dog?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.526
Well, "ditching"
is a harsh word.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.427
Enough chitchat.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.162
Time for Operation
Dog Dump.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.197
It wasn't really
a lot of chitchat.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.066
It was still
too much.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.772
We'll take good
care of your dog.

17:54.774 --> 17:55.640
I'm sure you will,

17:55.642 --> 17:59.143
because you take such good care
of your ostriches.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.511
(humming)

18:00.513 --> 18:01.179
D'oh.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.081
Maybe we should
get going.

18:03.583 --> 18:08.186
Bart, sweetie, would you
like to say good-bye?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
Well, boy, I guess this is it.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.524
We've shared a lot
of great memories,

18:13.526 --> 18:16.094
like the time we got
our picture in the paper

18:16.096 --> 18:17.795
with the caption
"Who's walking who?"

18:17.797 --> 18:21.265
I mailed them the answer,
but they never printed it.

18:21.267 --> 18:21.766
(sniffles)

18:21.768 --> 18:25.303
But it's not my fault
you're leaving, it's yours.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.504
Because you should never,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.306
ever kill a bird!

18:28.308 --> 18:29.273
Ever!

18:29.375 --> 18:31.576
I'd like a moment to myself.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.179
(cell phone ringing)

18:35.181 --> 18:37.615
Ooh, unknown caller!

18:37.617 --> 18:38.683
(squawks)

18:38.685 --> 18:40.051
Hey!

18:42.422 --> 18:46.324
All right, you, give me back
my phone and nobody gets hurt!

18:46.326 --> 18:46.824
(grunts)

18:46.826 --> 18:48.459
You said nobody gets hurt!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.561
Those were your exact words!

18:50.563 --> 18:53.164
(grunting)

18:53.166 --> 18:55.399
(whimpers)

18:57.170 --> 18:58.703
(squawking)

18:58.705 --> 18:59.737
(grunting)

18:59.739 --> 19:02.340
(screaming)

19:05.245 --> 19:08.746
So, Lisa, do you want an
ostrich feather centerpiece?

19:08.748 --> 19:09.714
Not really.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.449
Well, we've got
to buy something.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.152
(ostrich squawking,
Bart screaming)

19:14.854 --> 19:15.887
Help!

19:15.889 --> 19:17.188
(barking)

19:17.190 --> 19:18.589
Kill the bird!
(growling)

19:18.591 --> 19:21.759
Never kill a bird!
Never kill a bird!

19:21.761 --> 19:23.728
(whimpering)

19:31.204 --> 19:32.336
Why, you little...

19:32.338 --> 19:34.572
(pained squawking)

19:39.379 --> 19:42.346
Pa! You got to see this!

19:43.082 --> 19:45.283
Oh, right, I-I forgot.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.652
(pained squawking)

19:49.789 --> 19:52.123
(groans):
Oh.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.495
More Oxycontin
Candy, sweetie?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.663
Mm-hmm.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.506
Well, boy, I guess
I owe you an apology.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.675
Who's a bird-eating monster?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.410
You are! You are!

20:12.412 --> 20:14.512
Yes, you are.

20:14.514 --> 20:14.845
Aw.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.915
Well, Bart learned a lesson,
and most important of all,

20:17.917 --> 20:21.686
we don't have to stop
and pick up dinner.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.621
You do for me.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.327
(choking)

20:29.329 --> 20:31.495
(tires screeching)

20:34.701 --> 20:35.700

21:22.382 --> 21:24.548
Shh!
