00:06.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.178 --> 00:13.513
[Edha] Get up and get out.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.933
-[Teo] What is it?
-Get up and get out.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.272
-What happened?
-Lorenzo's looking for you.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.652
[snorts]

00:29.529 --> 00:32.073
-Can you explain what happened?
-Family business.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.075
I know who you are.

00:40.832 --> 00:41.833
Who am I?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.210
Are you going to keep lying?

00:48.673 --> 00:51.718
-Brother of the foreman who died.
-You weren't involved.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.304
Why did you come here?

00:54.679 --> 00:56.806
-I wanted to know.
-Now you know.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.517
I didn't know of it.
Now it's late, they're coming for me.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.686
I know things that can help you. Trust me.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.023
Trust? You lied to me all along!

01:07.358 --> 01:08.193
Not all.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.838
I don't care what you say,
that son of a bitch is out of our company.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.806
[Edha]  Teo lied to me.
I trusted him and he lied.

01:38.306 --> 01:43.102
I should be furious, I should hate him.
I should listen to my father's advice.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.687
But I don't.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.690
Strangely,
I feel closer to him than ever.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.528
I understand Teo's motivation.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.905
He, like me, is looking for the truth.

01:55.990 --> 01:59.452
Avenge his brother's death,
find out who set fire to the factory.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.454
Hey.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.166
-There was a bike there, did you see it?
-No, I didn't.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.419
-Weren't you here all night?
-I fell asleep.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.756
A guy like you
shouldn't worry about a bike.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.882
What?

02:18.680 --> 02:22.851
[Edha]  Teo is no longer a mystery to me,
but he's starting to be one to himself.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.104
I need him... and he needs me.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.730
He's dangerous, Edha.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.525
You have no common sense.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.069
Your self-destructing tendencies
want him here.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.864
There are images of Teo everywhere.
Tatiana wants him in Milan.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.159
-Without him, we lose everything.
-You know more about business than me?

02:39.826 --> 02:43.079
Can we talk in private?
Get the door, please.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.414
Go, Aníbal.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.462
We're partners.
You can't decide things on your own.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.300
Partnerships have expiration dates.
I am the brand.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.011
From now on, Edha is Teo.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.805
We're not changing anything.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.892
Don't speak to Teo.
The only one who speaks to him is me.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.436
He's the brother of a guy
who died in the factory.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.856
-Why do you think he's here?
-A factory you contracted, not me.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.107
[Aníbal] Edha...

03:12.317 --> 03:13.318
it's for you.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.737
Who is it?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.117
Yes?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.994
-Edha Abadi?
-Yes.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.955
You're being subpoenaed.
I need your signature, please.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.251
[sighs]

03:33.296 --> 03:34.422
Good, this is yours.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.883
[Lorenzo] Thank you, officer. See him out.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.218
[Aníbal] This way, officer.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.679
A subpoena about your factory.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.016
What about the DA?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.353
-You two have history.
-I'll call Pastene.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.231
I know very well that you planned
Antonio's testimony

03:51.314 --> 03:54.275
with your lawyer behind my back.
I'm not stupid.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.443
What are you saying?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.446
I'll handle my legal issues from now on.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.366
I'm going to speak with Durruti,
my lawyer.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.917
I'm close by. I need to see you.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.294
No, now.

04:17.799 --> 04:21.844
They're talking about a guy who had
trouble with your brother... Ollanta.

04:21.928 --> 04:22.971
Yes.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.098
My brother left him hanging.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.727
[Teo]  He was the guy who gave
Manito a job when we got to this city.

04:29.811 --> 04:34.232
[Mota]  Looks like Ollanta is really mad.
A seamstress who worked with him

04:34.315 --> 04:37.360
told me that your brother's sweatshop
put him out of business.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.655
After the sweatshop fire,
Ollanta disappeared.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.865
He's the one to blame.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.744
[door opens and closes, footsteps]

04:47.870 --> 04:48.871
[Ollanta] Hello.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.459
I'm waiting for you.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.338
[Ollanta] I want my people back.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.758
I told you I wasn't coming back.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.387
Those people aren't yours.
They wanted to come here with me.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.432
This is how you repay me?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.144
You were dead on your feet.
I gave you a job.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.647
-I've already learned it.
-Son of a bitch.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.610
Son of a bitch. Who are you working for?
Who gave you the money?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.112
[Aníbal] What's up?

05:26.784 --> 05:30.621
You're playing away from home here.
No one around here knows you.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.000
In this workshop, I'm the home team.
I'm in charge.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.961
Watch your ass, dude.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.256
Watch it,
because I'm gonna bust it so bad.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.175
You for being a ho...

05:43.676 --> 05:45.344
and your pimp for having lip.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.932
Do things right, you don't want
this place going up in smoke.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.393
You'd have a real mess on your hands.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.215
[Mota]  You knew Ollanta.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.801
You said nothing
when I told you about him.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.595
Nor did you tell me you worked for the DA.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.847
We're getting to know each other.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.308
Tell me where I can find Ollanta.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.893
He's lying low.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.937
What are you going to do?

06:57.667 --> 07:00.128
-Why are you after me?
-Excuse me?

07:00.962 --> 07:03.214
You're mixing up the fire
with my mother's death.

07:03.881 --> 07:09.303
No, Inés Musccini's death was one case,
the sweatshop is another case.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.306
Stop harassing me.
I'm not connected to the sweatshop.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.768
There's no harassment here.
It's an ongoing investigation.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.937
You're obsessed with Lorenzo.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.731
Your investigation drags
something personal into the case.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.735
You shouldn't be here.

07:25.111 --> 07:29.073
Your dad was sick, that's why he died.
Inés's case had nothing to do with it.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.243
We never knew what happened
with your mother, you don't know either.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.411
She killed herself.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.205
You should check what you've been told.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.250
-Inés Musccini committed suicide.
-Really?

07:41.627 --> 07:42.837
Is that what you think?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.305
What are you doing?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.932
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.768
-Where to?
-None of your business.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.481
You're free... to let them fool you,
dress you up,

08:01.564 --> 08:03.608
appear on magazine covers.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.277
Stop pretending that you care for me.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.279
-I care for you.
-Yes, a lot.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.115
Last night you cared about me,
wherever you were.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.535
-Remember what you told me?
-I do, you're the one who forgot.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.413
-You even forgot about Manito.
-I haven't forgotten!

08:17.497 --> 08:20.625
-But you're a traitor.
-You don't tell me what to do.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.587
I'm earning money and doing well.
I'm not throwing that away.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.005
I'm going to use it.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.549
Celia...

08:29.509 --> 08:31.093
what are you doing?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.762
We have nothing in common.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.432
You're dead, like your brother.
You just haven't realized yet.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.226
Idiot.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.071
[Yastin] I thought you were staying.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.115
-He can die.
-We all die at some point.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.034
If we make it to 15, we're lucky.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.870
It's late. Put this on.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.998
-Where are we going?
-Where we should be already. Get in.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.959
-Hi, Pija.
-What's up, kid?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.127
[motor revs]

09:05.753 --> 09:06.879
Come on, Pija.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.465
[motor revs]

09:31.487 --> 09:35.032
I like it, but something's wrong
with the pattern. It's wrinkled.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.409
-Here.
-OK.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.911
[footsteps approach]

09:44.417 --> 09:45.585
Hurry up with that.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.422
I'm going to die.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.300
-No, you're not, Ronnie.
-No?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.428
-Look at this.
-What is that?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.430
An ECG. Look at it.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.433
If you were diagnosed
with something, tell me.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.935
You don't need to be a doctor.
Compare the peaks.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.438
-Look at the difference. See?
-No, I don't.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.857
Antonio, I'll die if you don't come back.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.402
It's not the right time to go back.
Let's keep our distance.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.446
It's not the time to keep our distance.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.781
You're scared, that's why
you're back with your family.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.199
Did you get the report?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.911
The report for the ECG?

10:23.205 --> 10:24.707
Don't be this cold with me.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.792
I'm capable of anything.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.257
[door closes]

10:33.758 --> 10:35.426
[Durruti] You should
have called me before.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.096
I thought Lorenzo would deal with it.
He always deals with legal issues.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.558
"Lorenzo deals with it." Your mother
used to say the same, then she'd call.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.603
-Is this the subpoena?
-Yes.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.861
It's a complex issue.
But a subpoena is a logical move.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.655
I'll get the case file and call you.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.699
I want to ask you for something else,
but it's personal.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.451
Everything's personal, tell me.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.245
I need to see something, you can get it.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.540
-Tell me what.
-My mother's case file.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.407
[cellphone vibrates]

11:39.824 --> 11:43.035
[cellphone rings]

11:47.123 --> 11:49.041
It's settled. I talked to Lorenzo.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.543
Y ou're staying at EDHA.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.253
Does he know who I am?

11:52.336 --> 11:55.506
He does. But like me, he needs you.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.676
-Did you see the posters?
-Yes.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.888
Are you sure?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.308
I've never been more sure.
I'll wait for you.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.393
OK.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.747
I want this one.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.292
How much is it?

12:35.337 --> 12:37.381
[motor starts]

12:37.465 --> 12:39.592
[engine revs]

12:41.385 --> 12:43.053
[engine revs]

12:44.680 --> 12:46.932
[engine revs]

12:51.187 --> 12:55.441
The event at Paloma's store is confirmed,
but my dad won't let me call you.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.651
Won't your mom talk to him?

12:57.735 --> 13:01.447
We could've called a cab
and your dad wouldn't have known.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.782
I got scared, I told you.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.535
But now I can't see you.
When will he get over it?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.037
I don't know.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.580
He's watching me constantly.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.666
Thankfully he hasn't
pulled me out of school.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.211
My mom doesn't want to call him.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.464
My dad is acting really weird.
He's watching me all the time.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.758
That sucks.

13:20.841 --> 13:25.054
They take turns being at home.
They think I'm stupid and don't see it.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.430
Something happened with them.

13:28.807 --> 13:29.934
Are you there?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.770
Yes. Are you coming over today then?

13:33.437 --> 13:36.065
I don't know, it's complicated.
Text me the address.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.525
OK, got it.

13:38.567 --> 13:43.364
[footsteps approach]

13:47.785 --> 13:49.912
-Everything OK?
-Yeah.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.705
It's Mom.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.502
-Did you invite her over?
-No, I don't think she'd like it.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.837
I was just saying hello.

14:20.192 --> 14:24.947
You people don't learn. You make some
money and spend it all on toys, like kids.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.660
What people?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.996
You know what I mean.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.376
Be careful with the bike.
It's dangerous to ride on two wheels.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.049
A bike and keys to the house.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.887
[Edha] Did you give Florencia
your passport?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.013
Yes.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.558
Good. Today they'll make
the ticket reservations.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.811
You know how important
this is, don't you?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.688
-For you or for me?
-Both of us.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.442
What is it? Are you backing down?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.280
The fire could have been intentional.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.118
-Why would someone do that?
-That's what I want to know.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.706
-If it was, then the DA should know.
-He knows.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.208
They're covering it up.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.463
-Do they have a suspect?
-Yes.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.342
A guy that my brother worked for
when he started... Ollanta.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.177
We have to get him to testify.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.429
-Are you ready?
-Almost.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.769
What do I say?

15:36.852 --> 15:39.813
Tell your story. Not all of it.
People will love it.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.359
I don't think they'll like my story.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.236
We decide what's to like
and what's not. Go on.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.909
-[journalist] Hello.
-[Teo] Hello.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.411
-How are you?
-Good. You?

15:54.495 --> 15:55.746
This way.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.502
Are we ready? Good.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.548
What does an Argentinian feel

16:06.632 --> 16:09.176
about doing a show in Milan,
the fashion capital?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.014
I don't know, I'm not Argentinian.

16:15.057 --> 16:19.103
Oh. Where are you from?
How did you get here?

16:19.770 --> 16:23.273
-Do you have time?
-We do have time.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.192
DURRUTI: DONE, I HAVE THE FILE

16:25.275 --> 16:26.527
[Teo] What do you want to know?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.489
At what point did you think
about doing this?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.118
Don't touch that, it's really expensive.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.496
So? Did you talk? Is she interviewing us?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.749
She wants to see you. She's not
looking for a conventional model.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.710
-[Yastin] Hello.
-Hello.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.753
Erm...

16:45.546 --> 16:47.464
Yes. She's fine.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.884
I said you'd like her.
She's perfect for what you want.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.095
Yes... Yes, I like her.

16:53.595 --> 16:57.057
Celia is worth a lot.
On top of what you see, she's with Teo,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.393
-The ethnic model for Edha.
-Ethnic?

16:59.476 --> 17:01.854
If I close the deal, I'm keeping her.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.024
But I don't want you as a middleman.
No agencies.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.609
-[Celia] What are you talking about?
-Does she have a passport?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.028
What for?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.904
Does it have to be Argentinian?

17:11.238 --> 17:12.614
We're going to Milan.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.534
[Paloma] Edha will not be
the only one going.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.001
Here's the file on Inés's death.

17:24.501 --> 17:28.297
I made you a copy,
but that's not your priority now.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.509
We have to prove you didn't know anything
about the factory that caught fire.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.595
-I didn't know anything.
-That's not enough.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.598
There's a DA who wants you to testify,
that means pretrial detention.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.266
-What?
-You heard.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.853
We have to focus on finding something
to uphold your version.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.065
Mariano, in two weeks I'm going to travel

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
to the most important fashion fair--

17:48.192 --> 17:51.278
Sorry, that's not going to happen,
because DA Pereyra Ramos

17:51.361 --> 17:53.989
issued a temporary injunction
to stop you leaving the country.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.033
So I'll tell you what we'll do.

17:56.116 --> 18:00.704
You'll sit with my secretary and remember
everything that happened that night.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.333
Every minute, in great detail. OK?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.126
[Edha]  Now I can't leave the country.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.170
If this doesn't get settled,
Milan is over for us.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.924
Darling, let me talk with Pastene
and see what the best strategy is.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.510
I don't want you or your lawyer.
I'll solve this.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.554
You can't act rashly. OK?

18:17.638 --> 18:19.264
This is a very delicate issue.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.726
I got the money
to pay the company's debts,

18:22.810 --> 18:24.478
and I'm responsible for that.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.271
I don't care who you owe.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.856
Yes, I know you don't.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.234
You and your mother
always lived a fantasy,

18:30.317 --> 18:33.112
and I had to figure out
how to pay the debts.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.280
I can't argue about this,
I'm driving. Bye.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.122
[motor starts]

18:48.085 --> 18:51.463
The campaign is impressive,
they covered the city with posters.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.259
I guess. It's marketing, posing as art.

18:55.884 --> 18:59.680
Edha won by plagiarizing her own mother.
It's whimsical what she did.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.349
An insane investment
that could also go wrong.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.561
-Why?
-Well, it's always a possibility.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.564
Look at you here, with Edha's daughter.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.275
She's my daughter too, OK?

19:11.358 --> 19:12.609
Where can I change?

19:13.026 --> 19:16.864
Yes... hold on a moment,
another girl is coming. OK?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.248
No!

19:28.250 --> 19:31.295
That girl knows me.
She's the one who was on our turf.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.006
-Is that her?
-Her and two others.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.632
-Did she see your face?
-Yes.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.633
Fuck.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.013
-Are you waiting for someone?
-No.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.306
Huh?

19:42.389 --> 19:44.725
-Nice place, congratulations.
-Thank you.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.811
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-No way, I'm not leaving.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.899
-Let me, you play dumb.
-But she'll recognize me. I scared her.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.402
Even if she does, that doesn't mean
she'll talk. Look at her.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.947
She's a rich kid. You're a nobody.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.073
And if she talks?

20:00.824 --> 20:03.076
Deny it, straight-faced.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.328
[loudspeaker] Yastin!

20:04.411 --> 20:05.662
Yes! They called us.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.546
[Paloma] This way. Celia, Elena,
you'll be in the same sector.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.548
You can go and change.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.842
-Sorry, Yastin, Luciano Jáuregui.
-Hello.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.220
[Paloma] He's Elena's father,
a future court judge.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.347
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.485
-Who is he?
-He runs an alternative agency.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.070
A color I'd like to include.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.239
A really weird color.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.492
Weird is you asking me to include Elena.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.203
A father helping his daughter,
what's weird?

20:46.995 --> 20:48.538
So, you're Edha's daughter?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.708
Perhaps we came across each other before.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.504
-I've never seen you before.
-I recognize your face from somewhere.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.422
Maybe from some magazine.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.300
[Yastin] I don't think
we go to the same places.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.760
I don't know you.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.596
You look nervous.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.224
Not at all.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.646
-Nervous?
-No.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.732
Worse. Angry.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.735
-You look tense. What happened?
-Nothing.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.738
-You were happy to come here.
-I am happy.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.491
-So? What happened?
-I told you, nothing.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.784
Elen...

21:26.326 --> 21:28.453
Elen... I know you by now.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.082
I don't like them being here.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.626
No, I don't like it either, but...

21:35.252 --> 21:36.169
did something happen?

21:39.589 --> 21:43.093
Elena. Your attitude changed when
they got here. Tell me what happened.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.263
She was in the gang
that robbed us.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.473
When you picked me up.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.770
Are you sure? It's a serious accusation.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.522
I'm sure, or I wouldn't tell you.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.318
Don't talk to her, please,
it'll only be worse.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.405
JULIÁN: I'M OUTSIDE

22:03.488 --> 22:05.198
-I'll be right back.
-Don't go far.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.700
I'm just getting some air.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.044
[Celia talking, indistinct]

22:18.545 --> 22:20.213
Can we talk for a second, please?

22:20.714 --> 22:21.757
Yes.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.513
-My daughter told me everything.
-Everything?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.390
I'm sure she kept something to herself.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.602
-I know what happened the other night.
-What do you know?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.771
Your kid likes being a drug dealer?

22:36.396 --> 22:38.148
Come on, man, I'm working here.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.609
Looks like you have
varied activities, right?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.153
What do you mean by that?

22:43.862 --> 22:46.573
Your daughter and me are the same shit.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.659
The only difference is
she thinks she dresses well.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.085
[cellphone beeps]

23:16.186 --> 23:18.980
What are you doing here?
We didn't agree anything.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.691
Don't be childish. I wanted to see you.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.945
This is finished, Julián.
We can't see each other.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.073
I'll do things the right way.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.700
-No!
-I'll give you all the time you need.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.828
I don't want that.

23:33.787 --> 23:37.124
I want everything to be like before.
Me and Delfi, you with Monina.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.297
It's too late for that now.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.092
I can't do this.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.136
Not anymore.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.145
Goodbye.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.197
Bye.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.702
[car door shuts]

24:34.139 --> 24:35.432
Where have you been?

24:35.932 --> 24:37.767
-Outside.
-Doing what?

24:38.643 --> 24:39.936
Getting some air.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.315
The other night you went to a party.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.484
You like to say things half way.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.653
I told you the truth.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.031
I went to a party.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.325
You don't believe me?

24:54.993 --> 24:57.329
-Who were you talking to?
-Mom.

24:57.412 --> 25:01.791
She misses me. I miss her,
and the fact that she doesn't distrust me.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.376
It seems like you do.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.254
I get it, you don't know me yet.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.051
I want to see her today.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.013
-I'll take you.
-No, I'd rather go alone.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.681
I'll be back early.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.938
-Where does that guy live?
-Who?

25:23.021 --> 25:25.482
-The one you told me about.
-Ollanta?

25:26.608 --> 25:28.693
-Far away, in the suburbs.
-I'll take you.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.862
-No.
-You told me to trust you, trust me.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.906
[Edha]  I need to know
if this man is guilty.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.380
Did something happen?

25:52.050 --> 25:53.343
Lorenzo lied to me.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.554
He lied to me for years.

25:57.847 --> 26:01.226
His statement says that
he was in the city the night Inés died.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.687
I always thought he was on a trip.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.982
He showed up at the burial
with a suitcase. Why did he lie?

26:08.733 --> 26:10.735
[inhales deeply]

26:11.444 --> 26:14.114
[door rattles]

26:19.703 --> 26:20.787
Monina!

26:22.163 --> 26:24.124
Monina, open up, I need to come in!

26:25.583 --> 26:27.377
[banging on door]

26:28.503 --> 26:29.838
[banging on door]

26:29.921 --> 26:31.589
Monina, I need some clothes!

26:32.173 --> 26:34.050
[banging on door]

26:34.759 --> 26:36.261
[banging on door]

26:38.430 --> 26:41.766
Monina, can you open the door?
I know you're inside, open up!

26:42.434 --> 26:45.020
"The widower claims to have been
on a business trip.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.731
Plane tickets and hotel receipt
are presented as evidence.

26:47.814 --> 26:51.359
But he returns from his trip
ahead of schedule, at 9 pm.

26:51.443 --> 26:56.990
He doesn't return to his home address
but stays overnight at 445 Ituzaingó St.

26:57.073 --> 27:00.660
[Edha]  The extramarital bond
is therefore confirmed

27:00.744 --> 27:03.997
and the declarant's testimony
confirms the alibi."

27:04.080 --> 27:07.709
See? He had a lover
and was with her that day.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.211
OK. Give me the name,
tell me who she is.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.839
I need you to find out.
That page is missing.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.842
I need to know who she is.
I'll wait for your call.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.055
[sighs]

27:24.392 --> 27:25.643
You should go home.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.647
Are you sure?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.650
Yes. I'll take care of Ollanta.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.197
Thank you.

27:43.703 --> 27:47.290
[Edha]  Tonight, Teo and I
are united by a search for the truth.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.127
A truth hidden by others...

27:51.920 --> 27:54.214
but mostly by ourselves.

27:58.760 --> 28:03.056
Before moving forward together,
we have to see our stories through...

28:04.682 --> 28:06.643
and we have to do it on our own.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.605
Take separate paths
so we can later reunite.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.654
-Come on, relax a little.
-No, I don't want to.

28:19.155 --> 28:22.325
I can't believe that chick was there.
Is she a model too?

28:22.409 --> 28:23.952
I can't believe it either.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.039
-Paloma has no standards.
-She didn't know.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.333
People are so weird.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.503
Here.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.506
No, I have to go to my dad's.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.760
You're the only person
who wants to go back to jail.

28:41.177 --> 28:44.305
I don't want to go back. He's a pain.

28:45.473 --> 28:48.143
He was never around,
now he wants to look after me.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.562
-What will you do?
-I don't know.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.648
I don't know if I should
go back to my mom's.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.901
We should live together somewhere.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.154
I can't stand my parents either.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.115
-Shall we?
-Let's do it.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.784
-[Sebastián] Shall we?
-Let's do it.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.745
[they laugh]

29:07.620 --> 29:10.248
[Delfina] Come on, do something
naughty for once in your life.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.917
-[Sebastián] That's the spirit!
-[Delfina] Yeah!

29:13.001 --> 29:15.837
-Smoke it right.
-Yeah, smoke it and like it.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.091
[people rapping in background]

29:20.800 --> 29:22.427
[Sebastián laughs]

29:23.845 --> 29:25.722
My dad is acting really weird.

29:26.222 --> 29:27.807
[Delfina] They argued a lot today.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.726
I don't want to know.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.811
[laughs]

29:32.479 --> 29:35.815
-Looks like Elena got grumpy and high.
-I'm not high yet.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.401
[rappers in background] Hey!

29:49.621 --> 29:52.040
[beatboxing]

29:52.123 --> 29:57.337
[rapping]  Rapping texts, smoking pot,
Watching my mind activate with the dope

29:57.420 --> 30:02.342
When the night falls, I burn out a jay,
Words pour out of me, my mind flies away

30:02.425 --> 30:07.305
Even if a killjoy says it's bad for me,
This natural fruit fills me with glee

30:07.388 --> 30:09.849
To share this, with all my brothers

30:09.933 --> 30:12.602
Like with the rhymes,
From one to the other

30:12.685 --> 30:14.103
[crowd] Whoa!

30:14.187 --> 30:17.232
[rapping]  By the window in my room
I have a holy plant

30:17.315 --> 30:20.026
I tend to it and smoke it
I love it

30:20.109 --> 30:22.445
And though I know it's banned

30:22.529 --> 30:25.657
I don't think it's wrong
To share it with my pals

30:25.740 --> 30:27.826
In spring, I sow the fruit

30:27.909 --> 30:30.495
In winter
I harvest it, roll it, enjoy it

30:30.578 --> 30:32.413
[crowd] Whoa!

30:32.497 --> 30:35.208
[beatboxing]

30:35.291 --> 30:38.461
That idiot is Edha's daughter.
Her father is a judge.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.964
So what? We can make lots of money.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.590
I know, but I don't like it.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.470
Celia, you've never thought
of going to Milan. It's a dream.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.598
Yes, it's a dream,
but that girl worries me sick.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.017
I'll call Paloma
and tell her you're not going.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.936
The other girl is going.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.814
-I didn't say that.
-Yes, you didn't say it.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.109
You said some other stupidity.
We don't choose who goes.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.862
What matters is
that Paloma takes us with her.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.280
[breathes deeply]

31:05.363 --> 31:06.489
Listen to me.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.200
This is what I need to change my life.

31:09.742 --> 31:13.121
-Don't fuck it up. Is that clear?
-Yes.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.459
-[Edha]  Durruti .
-I made some calls.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.380
I have to check the info,
but I think I know who the woman is.

31:22.463 --> 31:25.216
-Who?
-María Antonia Gómez.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.176
She goes by "Marita."

31:28.928 --> 31:30.138
What's her address?

31:38.187 --> 31:39.314
Mom?

32:24.442 --> 32:27.904
[cellphone rings]

32:28.446 --> 32:31.407
-Hi, Dad.
-[Jáuregui]  Elena, are you OK?

32:31.491 --> 32:33.201
Yes, I'm at Mom's.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.787
You were coming back early.
Put your mother on.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.331
She's sleeping.
She'll kill me if I wake her up.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.084
Tomorrow is an important day, Elena.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.087
-Why? What happens?
-What happens?

32:44.671 --> 32:47.507
They decide if I'm part
of the Supreme Court. It's nothing.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.386
-Oh, impressive.
-Impressive, yes.

32:51.469 --> 32:55.723
I don't have time to play cab driver
or run after a problematic teenager.

32:56.265 --> 32:58.643
I'm not problematic. Who told you that?

32:59.143 --> 33:01.354
I'm not an idiot. I want you home.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.731
Let me stay at Mom's, I'll come tomorrow.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.359
-You're coming now.
-I don't get it.

33:06.442 --> 33:09.028
Is that a house or a prison?

33:10.029 --> 33:12.115
Let me stay at Mom's. I'll come tomorrow.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.950
[hangs up]

33:20.039 --> 33:21.666
[sighs]

33:32.802 --> 33:36.264
CLOTHES MADE TO MEASURE!

33:41.728 --> 33:43.604
[doorbell rings]

33:46.941 --> 33:49.235
[door buzzes open]

34:39.077 --> 34:40.703
[doorbell rings]

34:47.043 --> 34:49.087
-Hello.
-Marita?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.214
Yes?

34:52.006 --> 34:55.468
I'm Edha. Inés and Lorenzo's daughter,
Edha Abadi.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.012
You worked at our home, remember me?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.181
Yes.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.809
Yes, of course... you were a child.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.977
Can I come in?

35:55.611 --> 35:57.864
Hey! Welcome.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.533
Do you like it?

36:02.118 --> 36:04.537
It wasn't an accident. Talk.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.913
You finally realized?

36:07.373 --> 36:08.916
It took you a while.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.545
You couldn't stand it
when Manito left the factory.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.463
Your brother was very rude.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.507
I taught him everything.

36:17.216 --> 36:20.011
I gave him a place, and he fucked me over.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.846
Good riddance.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.390
-You set fire to the factory.
-No.

36:25.308 --> 36:29.353
It wasn't me, though I should have.
But it wasn't me. Now get out.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.023
-Who did it then?
-How should I know?

36:32.690 --> 36:35.193
I wouldn't tell you, I'm no rat.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.364
Who set fire to the factory?

36:44.243 --> 36:46.787
-Talk.
-Don't make a mistake.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.665
[man]  Drop the gun.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.256
Manito?

37:05.306 --> 37:07.308
