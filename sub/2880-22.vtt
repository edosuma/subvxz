00:02.151 --> 00:05.786
Gentlemen, <i>Star Wars</i> day
is rapidly approaching.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.538
We should finalize our plans.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.606
What? That's a real thing?

00:10.358 --> 00:12.776
What is it, <i>Star Wars</i> Christmas?

00:12.778 --> 00:15.379
No. Don't be ridiculous.

00:15.381 --> 00:17.331
That's Wookiee Life Day.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.917
So, when is it?

00:19.919 --> 00:22.636
Uh, well, it's not
May the fifth...

00:22.638 --> 00:25.556
and it's not
May the third...

00:28.960 --> 00:31.979
It's May the fourth.

00:33.331 --> 00:35.482
Get it?

00:35.484 --> 00:38.519
May the fourth
be with you?

00:39.404 --> 00:41.805
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

00:41.807 --> 00:44.575
Oh, no. This face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

01:15.653 --> 01:16.752
Come in.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.589
Hey, you got a second?

01:20.591 --> 01:21.740
Yes.

01:21.742 --> 01:23.075
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

01:23.077 --> 01:26.662
I-I'm working on the
<i>Star Wars</i> Day schedule.

01:26.664 --> 01:30.065
Now, I have a window built in
after <i>Phantom Menace,</i>

01:30.067 --> 01:32.017
for complaining, but...

01:33.970 --> 01:37.106
...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

01:39.592 --> 01:42.861
Sheldon, I-I've got
some bad news.

01:42.863 --> 01:43.979
What is it

01:43.981 --> 01:46.782
I just read online

01:46.784 --> 01:49.434
that Arthur Jeffries
passed away.

01:51.271 --> 01:53.305
Professor Proton is dead?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.158
Sorry, buddy.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.336 --> 02:08.554
What are you doing?

02:08.556 --> 02:11.773
Comforting you?

02:11.775 --> 02:14.092
Y-Your heart might be
in the right place,

02:14.094 --> 02:16.345
but your head, chest and
arms certainly aren't.

02:18.765 --> 02:20.732
Anyway, the-the
funeral's on Sunday.

02:20.734 --> 02:23.352
But, that's
<i>Star Wars</i> Day.

02:23.354 --> 02:25.470
Yeah... um...

02:25.472 --> 02:27.940
of all the things about this
that are sad,

02:27.942 --> 02:30.809
that might not be number one.

02:32.245 --> 02:34.446
You okay?
I know he meant a lot to you.

02:34.448 --> 02:36.481
I'm fine.

02:36.483 --> 02:39.317
Okay.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.590
Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

02:46.593 --> 02:48.577
This, uh,
this is something interesting

02:48.579 --> 02:50.045
boys and girls.

02:50.047 --> 02:53.749
After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

02:53.751 --> 02:57.452
that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

03:00.156 --> 03:01.757
Is-Isn't that a hoot?

03:06.429 --> 03:10.866
We'll be right back
after I fire my writers.

03:11.969 --> 03:14.803
Oh, shut up.

03:14.805 --> 03:17.039
Watching your
old friend?

03:17.041 --> 03:19.074
Hmm. Yes.

03:19.076 --> 03:20.325
Look at him, Amy.

03:20.327 --> 03:21.843
It's such a shame.

03:21.845 --> 03:24.546
Struck down
in the prime of my life.

03:26.365 --> 03:29.534
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

03:29.536 --> 03:31.386
Oh, I'm not going
to the funeral.

03:31.388 --> 03:32.804
Why not?

03:32.806 --> 03:35.040
All those people
blowing their noses.

03:35.042 --> 03:39.061
You can't tell the sick
from the sad. Mm.

03:39.063 --> 03:43.181
I'll be at home celebrating
<i>Star Wars</i> Day, as planned.

03:43.183 --> 03:45.400
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

03:45.402 --> 03:51.089
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

03:51.091 --> 03:53.742
And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

03:53.744 --> 03:55.994
you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

03:55.996 --> 03:58.597
If we were in
a physical relationship,

03:58.599 --> 04:00.282
you just lost sex tonight.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.003
Hey, guys.

04:05.005 --> 04:08.123
Hey, Penny.
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

04:09.592 --> 04:11.593
Okay.

04:11.595 --> 04:13.578
Can I make you
breakfast?

04:13.580 --> 04:17.766
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.084
No, thanks. Leonard and I
are just going to the funeral.

04:20.087 --> 04:22.253
You sure. Not even coffee?

04:22.255 --> 04:24.422
We have R2-Decaf.

04:25.108 --> 04:28.310
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

04:29.445 --> 04:31.096
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

04:31.098 --> 04:33.649
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

04:33.651 --> 04:37.602
Oh, I get it-- like C-3PO.

04:37.604 --> 04:39.571
What happened to me?

04:39.573 --> 04:42.440
Hey, uh, Sheldon,
you want anything?

04:42.442 --> 04:43.992
Uh, no, thank you.

04:43.994 --> 04:45.443
You're being so quiet.

04:45.445 --> 04:49.197
Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

04:49.199 --> 04:50.966
I'm fine.

04:50.968 --> 04:52.334
Sweetie, are you sure

04:52.336 --> 04:54.619
you don't want to
come with us to the funeral?

04:54.621 --> 04:56.838
Oh, I appreciate the
offer, but Arthur is gone

04:56.840 --> 04:59.091
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

04:59.093 --> 05:01.643
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

05:01.645 --> 05:04.346
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

05:04.348 --> 05:05.347
No.

05:05.349 --> 05:06.565
He blew up the Death Star.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.317
Why do I know this?!

05:09.736 --> 05:11.803
Arthur Jeffries
was a scientist.

05:11.805 --> 05:13.271
I'm sure he didn't care about

05:13.273 --> 05:15.640
silly superstitions
like funerals.

05:15.642 --> 05:18.076
You know, if he were here,
I think he'd say,

05:18.078 --> 05:19.945
"Enjoy <i>Star Wars</i> Day."

05:19.947 --> 05:23.081
He was 84;
he'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

05:24.667 --> 05:27.069
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

05:27.071 --> 05:30.088
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.758
Oh, like <i>Attack</i>
<i>of the Clones.</i>

05:32.760 --> 05:34.926
We are leaving
right now.

05:36.796 --> 05:39.197
Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

05:39.199 --> 05:40.849
than he's ready to admit.

05:40.851 --> 05:42.517
Really hoping
this will cheer him up.

05:42.519 --> 05:43.685
Me, too.

05:43.687 --> 05:45.053
Although, it
might've been

05:45.055 --> 05:47.439
thoughtless of us to
bake a Death Star cake.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.176
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

05:51.178 --> 05:52.644
chocolate chips

05:52.646 --> 05:56.114
and the ability to destroy a
planet at the push of a button.

05:56.116 --> 05:59.151
Well, anyway, it'll be a
nice surprise for the boys.

05:59.153 --> 06:01.570
And Howie doesn't think I
take his interests seriously,

06:01.572 --> 06:04.289
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

06:04.291 --> 06:08.326
Okay, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

06:08.328 --> 06:09.795
This is pretty cool.

06:09.797 --> 06:12.381
You don't see too many
spherical cakes.

06:15.118 --> 06:17.819
I wonder why that is.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.211
I have a confession to make.
Hmm?

06:26.213 --> 06:28.313
I've never been
to a funeral before.

06:28.315 --> 06:29.314
Really?

06:29.316 --> 06:31.216
I just never knew
anyone that died.

06:31.218 --> 06:33.652
I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.104
I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

06:36.106 --> 06:38.190
we had a barbecue.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.662
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

06:46.565 --> 06:50.401
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

06:50.403 --> 06:53.538
It's weird that he's...
just gone.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.090
I know.

06:55.092 --> 06:57.592
I feel like I want to cry.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.577
Oh... that's-that's fine.

06:59.579 --> 07:01.096
Go ahead.

07:06.219 --> 07:07.719
I can't do it
with you staring at me.

07:07.721 --> 07:09.554
Sorry.

07:13.059 --> 07:15.093
No, I'm dry.

07:15.095 --> 07:17.646
You're a big crybaby--
you start, I'll join in.

07:18.731 --> 07:20.649
I am not a crybaby.

07:20.651 --> 07:21.933
<i>Toy Story 3?</i>

07:21.935 --> 07:25.237
The toys were holding hands
in a furnace!

07:30.159 --> 07:32.944
Look, A-Arthur lived
a full life.

07:32.946 --> 07:36.298
And he inspired
a lot of people.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.251
Sure, he-he was
my childhood hero,

07:39.253 --> 07:42.804
but... the fact that
I got to work with him,

07:42.806 --> 07:45.590
side by side,
before he...

07:45.592 --> 07:48.459
died was...

07:48.461 --> 07:51.596
it was... it was a gift.

07:51.598 --> 07:54.149
It was a gift.

07:54.151 --> 07:56.485
Thank you for being
the emotional one

07:56.487 --> 07:58.520
in this relationship.

07:58.522 --> 08:01.139
I got your back.

08:01.141 --> 08:02.607
Yeah.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.945
Okay, here we go.

08:06.947 --> 08:09.247
<i>Episode I--</i>
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>

08:10.417 --> 08:11.816
Let's get this over with.

08:11.818 --> 08:13.952
Since we all agree
<i>Episode I</i> isn't our favorite,

08:13.954 --> 08:15.370
maybe we just skip it this time.

08:15.372 --> 08:17.455
Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

08:17.457 --> 08:18.823
should avoid espousing
the principle

08:18.825 --> 08:20.625
that if something
is not our favorite

08:20.627 --> 08:22.511
we should just get rid of it.

08:25.431 --> 08:28.333
You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

08:28.335 --> 08:31.636
called the Machete Order, where
you watch <i>Episodes IV</i> and <i>V,</i>

08:31.638 --> 08:33.388
then skip <i>Episode I,</i>

08:33.390 --> 08:35.774
watch <i>II</i> and <i>III</i>
as a flashback,

08:35.775 --> 08:37.308
and then finish with <i>VI.</i>

08:37.311 --> 08:39.443
Okay, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

08:39.446 --> 08:42.280
all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

08:42.282 --> 08:45.567
which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.169
Get rid of the
trade route part?

08:48.171 --> 08:50.405
Then how would Palpatine
get Chancellor Valorum

08:50.407 --> 08:51.806
kicked out of office?

08:51.808 --> 08:52.857
Eh.

08:52.859 --> 08:54.910
How would he get
himself elected? How?

08:54.912 --> 08:56.645
Can we get through one holiday

08:56.647 --> 08:59.831
without you saying
something ridiculous?

08:59.833 --> 09:01.132
It was just a suggestion.

09:01.134 --> 09:03.418
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

09:03.420 --> 09:05.420
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

09:05.422 --> 09:08.340
Hmm? And you know
who got hurt by that?

09:08.342 --> 09:10.258
Every single person
who eats breakfast!

09:13.613 --> 09:15.013
Wow.

09:15.015 --> 09:16.064
I think he's taking

09:16.066 --> 09:18.099
this Professor Proton thing
pretty hard.

09:18.101 --> 09:21.486
Should we try to console him?

09:21.488 --> 09:24.773
Or... should we
respect his privacy

09:24.775 --> 09:27.058
in this moment of grief?

09:27.060 --> 09:29.744
By staying here
and watching the movie.

09:29.746 --> 09:32.247
That's what
good friends would do!

09:42.263 --> 09:43.679
Well, at least
without Sheldon here,

09:43.681 --> 09:46.049
we got to start
with <i>Episode IV.</i>

09:46.051 --> 09:47.433
Mm, true.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.871
I do feel guilty about him.

09:51.873 --> 09:52.922
Me, too.

09:52.924 --> 09:53.973
Maybe we should see
how he's doing.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.007
Yeah.

09:55.009 --> 09:56.676
But after the cantina scene.
Obviously.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.501
Look at Arthur...

10:05.503 --> 10:08.604
cracking up at a joke
I told him.

10:11.408 --> 10:14.077
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

10:14.079 --> 10:16.712
You never
heard it <i>that</i> time.

10:21.301 --> 10:22.635
Arthur!

10:22.637 --> 10:24.804
I thought you were dead.

10:24.806 --> 10:26.255
I am.

10:26.257 --> 10:29.458
Oh, it-it's fantastic.

10:30.227 --> 10:32.311
I mean, this is the longest

10:32.313 --> 10:36.632
that I've gone without
running into a men's room

10:36.634 --> 10:39.602
in-in years.

10:40.437 --> 10:42.438
Why are you here?

10:42.440 --> 10:44.690
I-I don't know.
I was...

10:44.692 --> 10:49.061
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

10:49.863 --> 10:52.748
I know why.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.984
You've come
to me because

10:54.986 --> 10:58.504
you're my Obi-Wan.

10:58.506 --> 11:01.340
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

11:01.342 --> 11:04.460
Is... is-is that an...

11:04.462 --> 11:07.280
an Internet?

11:09.116 --> 11:10.600
Wow.

11:10.602 --> 11:13.603
Uh, you're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

11:14.838 --> 11:18.357
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from <i>Star Wars.</i>

11:18.359 --> 11:19.725
After his
physical demise,

11:19.727 --> 11:24.297
he comes to Luke Skywalker
as his mentor in spirit form.

11:24.299 --> 11:27.283
Well, that...
that clears that up.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.485
Yeah.

11:30.270 --> 11:32.972
You must be here
to give me advice.

11:38.295 --> 11:41.447
Well, this... this is weird.

11:42.199 --> 11:44.700
Most-most of my robes open in...

11:44.702 --> 11:46.869
in the back.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.707
Those are your Jedi robes.

11:52.576 --> 11:55.428
Oh, wait. What...?

11:55.430 --> 11:58.047
What-what... what is this?

11:58.983 --> 12:00.433
Oh! Be careful
with that!

12:00.435 --> 12:02.852
Whoa!

12:09.893 --> 12:11.577
Whoa!

12:13.231 --> 12:16.082
Oh, neato.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.790
I'm, uh... I'm going
to need a Band-Aid.

12:27.577 --> 12:30.246
So...

12:30.248 --> 12:32.131
what did you think
of your first funeral?

12:32.133 --> 12:36.585
Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

12:36.587 --> 12:39.939
Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

12:39.941 --> 12:42.225
You think about dying?

12:42.227 --> 12:46.262
Mm. Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

12:46.264 --> 12:47.647
What would you regret?

12:47.649 --> 12:50.700
Mm, you know,
that I didn't travel more,

12:50.702 --> 12:53.452
take more risks,
learn another language.

12:53.454 --> 12:56.072
You know Klingon.

12:56.074 --> 12:57.623
That's true.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.792
No, I meant that
as a regret.

13:03.947 --> 13:05.550
I just thought of one more.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.384
What's that?

13:07.386 --> 13:10.804
I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

13:12.674 --> 13:14.892
Well, it just wasn't
the right time.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.844
Yeah.

13:16.846 --> 13:18.679
And this is also
not the right time.

13:18.681 --> 13:20.564
Do not propose.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.349
What?

13:22.351 --> 13:24.735
I know that face.
That's your propose face.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.767
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

13:26.768 --> 13:27.818
What's two to one?

13:27.843 --> 13:29.569
I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.403
Oh, my... It's
not a contest.

13:31.405 --> 13:32.788
I don't know what
you're upset about.

13:32.790 --> 13:35.106
I'm the one who's losing.
Okay.

13:35.108 --> 13:36.941
Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

13:36.943 --> 13:38.660
so you could turn
me down again?

13:38.662 --> 13:40.045
Yeah, I think I would.

13:40.047 --> 13:42.047
Okay. Leonard,
will you marry me?

13:42.049 --> 13:44.666
Hmm.

13:44.668 --> 13:45.967
No, don't you dare.

13:45.969 --> 13:48.470
You reject me right
now and tie things up.

13:50.423 --> 13:52.557
It's just such a big decision.

13:52.559 --> 13:54.676
I don't want
to have any regrets.

13:57.263 --> 13:59.931
Did you ever watch
Professor Proton

13:59.933 --> 14:01.149
when you were a kid?

14:01.151 --> 14:02.467
No.

14:02.469 --> 14:03.802
My dad controlled the TV,

14:03.804 --> 14:05.637
so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

14:05.639 --> 14:07.939
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

14:09.158 --> 14:11.777
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

14:11.779 --> 14:13.445
that Sheldon got interested
in science.

14:13.447 --> 14:14.946
Not me. I got
into science

14:14.948 --> 14:17.148
'cause I was always the
smallest kid in school,

14:17.150 --> 14:19.167
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

14:19.169 --> 14:21.920
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

14:21.922 --> 14:23.672
That's cute.

14:23.674 --> 14:25.957
Yeah, I thought it was
working for a while,

14:25.959 --> 14:27.325
but then I found out

14:27.327 --> 14:31.129
my brother was just lowering the
pencil marks on the door frame.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.214
How about you?

14:32.216 --> 14:34.316
Oh, I guess
it must have been

14:34.318 --> 14:37.269
back when I was
in the Girl Sprouts.

14:37.271 --> 14:39.671
Girl <i>Sprouts?</i>

14:39.673 --> 14:42.474
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

14:42.476 --> 14:44.559
She didn't want me
selling cookies

14:44.561 --> 14:47.112
on some street corner
"like a whore."

14:51.016 --> 14:53.318
How did that get
you into science?

14:53.320 --> 14:54.953
Oh, I went to the library

14:54.955 --> 14:58.206
and took out a book on biology
to see what whores did.

15:01.544 --> 15:05.029
On the one hand,
if I say yes...

15:05.031 --> 15:07.048
This isn't funny anymore.

15:07.050 --> 15:08.717
Just say no
so we're done with this.

15:08.719 --> 15:10.535
Will you marry me or not?

15:10.537 --> 15:14.105
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

15:14.107 --> 15:16.374
No.
Really?

15:16.376 --> 15:18.310
Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

15:18.312 --> 15:21.479
That's two
proposals, one day.

15:21.481 --> 15:24.048
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

15:24.050 --> 15:26.885
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.939
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

15:30.941 --> 15:32.774
Hey.

15:32.776 --> 15:34.910
Penny, don't get upset.

15:34.912 --> 15:37.112
Here.

15:37.114 --> 15:41.082
I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.701
Thank you.

15:42.703 --> 15:44.068
Now, about that
second proposal.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.788
On the one hand...

15:57.800 --> 16:00.018
Where... where... where are we?

16:01.020 --> 16:04.189
This is the
swampland of Dagobah.

16:04.191 --> 16:07.058
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.310
Oh.

16:08.312 --> 16:11.563
Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

16:18.036 --> 16:22.240
When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

16:22.242 --> 16:25.609
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.112
So, um...

16:28.114 --> 16:31.032
what do you got for me?

16:31.034 --> 16:34.252
Um...

16:34.254 --> 16:36.454
always...

16:36.456 --> 16:38.740
get... get a prenup.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.729
That's it?

16:44.731 --> 16:48.483
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

16:48.485 --> 16:52.019
Well, why-why do <i>you</i> think
I'm here?

16:52.021 --> 16:55.606
I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

16:55.608 --> 16:58.576
Is-is this the...
the first time

16:58.578 --> 17:01.145
you've lost, you know,
someone close to you?

17:01.147 --> 17:03.281
Oh, no. No.

17:03.283 --> 17:06.701
I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

17:10.005 --> 17:13.040
Yeah, I've-I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

17:15.794 --> 17:19.012
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

17:19.015 --> 17:21.832
My father died when I was 14.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.551
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

17:24.554 --> 17:26.721
And now you're gone, too.

17:28.123 --> 17:31.359
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

17:32.311 --> 17:34.395
Well, you know, it's...

17:34.397 --> 17:37.899
it's okay to...
to be sad about them.

17:37.901 --> 17:42.737
Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate

17:42.739 --> 17:45.706
those who... who are
still there for you.

17:45.708 --> 17:49.577
But I do appreciate them.

17:49.579 --> 17:52.580
Well, then,

17:52.582 --> 17:55.550
what am I doing in a swamp...

18:00.422 --> 18:03.391
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

18:08.931 --> 18:11.582
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

18:14.387 --> 18:16.220
Hey, buddy.

18:16.222 --> 18:18.322
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

18:18.324 --> 18:20.074
I'm okay.

18:20.943 --> 18:23.227
How was the funeral?

18:24.062 --> 18:26.914
It was nice, you know.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.083
A lot of people showed up,

18:29.085 --> 18:32.069
told some great stories
about him.

18:32.071 --> 18:35.423
Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci...?

18:51.256 --> 18:53.774
Hey, the guys are about
to start <i>Jedi.</i>

18:53.776 --> 18:55.109
You want to go watch?

18:55.111 --> 18:56.760
I do.

18:58.113 --> 19:01.649
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

19:04.202 --> 19:06.804
Sheldon, that-that'll
take us all night.

19:06.806 --> 19:08.239
That's true.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.625
Oh, it's a good thing
I had a nap.

19:16.983 --> 19:18.883
Boy, some of the
physical comedy

19:18.885 --> 19:21.886
with Jar Jar is a
little tough to watch.

19:23.672 --> 19:26.991
At least they toned him down
in the second one.

19:26.993 --> 19:29.510
Yeah, he is
pretty stupid.

19:32.281 --> 19:34.815
Hey, we can say it.
You can't.

19:36.151 --> 19:37.685
Hey, guys.

19:37.687 --> 19:39.236
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day!

19:39.238 --> 19:41.072
Wow!

19:41.074 --> 19:43.441
- A Death Star cake!
- Yeah.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.742
We were hoping
it might cheer you up.

19:44.744 --> 19:45.660
And even though

19:45.662 --> 19:46.944
it meant we had to
miss the movies,

19:46.946 --> 19:48.195
we could still be
part of the fun.

19:48.197 --> 19:49.196
Well, you didn't
miss anything.

19:49.198 --> 19:50.314
We just started over.

19:50.316 --> 19:52.500
Son of a bitch.

20:11.654 --> 20:13.171
You're back.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.339
Yeah, apparently, um,

20:15.341 --> 20:18.142
I'm here whenever...
when-whenever you need me.

20:18.144 --> 20:19.977
That's nice.

20:19.979 --> 20:22.897
May-Maybe for you.

20:25.150 --> 20:27.702
Why do I need you now?

20:27.704 --> 20:30.154
Well, as near as I could tell,

20:30.156 --> 20:33.541
you-you fell asleep
watching <i>Star Wars,</i>

20:33.543 --> 20:37.244
and now you're-you're dreaming
you're watching <i>Star Wars.</i>

20:37.246 --> 20:39.013
So?

20:39.015 --> 20:42.032
I mean, don't-don't you see
a problem there?

20:42.034 --> 20:43.367
I mean, how-how

20:43.369 --> 20:46.704
you're spending
your limited time on Earth?

20:48.451 --> 20:50.617
Not at all.

20:50.619 --> 20:53.054
Okay, good luck to you.
