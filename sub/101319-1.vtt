00:31.857 --> 00:33.492
My wife...

00:34.627 --> 00:37.630
committed suicide
on our wedding day.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.507
<i>Tom, come here.</i>

00:48.774 --> 00:50.210
<i>What is it?</i>

00:50.243 --> 00:52.745
<i>"The Millennium Project
seeks married couples</i>

00:52.778 --> 00:56.016
<i>"to participate in a thirty day
research study.</i>

00:56.049 --> 00:58.986
<i>Payment,
fifty thousand dollars."</i>

00:59.019 --> 01:00.053
<i>Wow.</i>

01:00.653 --> 01:02.089
<i>You can finish your book.</i>

01:02.122 --> 01:04.890
<i>We'd have enough money
to start our lives together.</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:07.961
<i>If only I can find work.</i>

01:07.995 --> 01:09.930
<i>Fifty thousand dollars worth?</i>

01:10.964 --> 01:13.166
<i>Babe, we don't know
what this is.</i>

01:14.334 --> 01:16.036
<i>You're right.</i>

01:16.336 --> 01:18.604
<i>So how do you feel
about porn?</i>

01:18.637 --> 01:21.241
<i>We're not married.</i>

01:23.010 --> 01:24.277
<i>We lie.</i>

02:03.716 --> 02:05.318
Hold on, hold on.

02:06.652 --> 02:08.554
I almost forgot.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.991
It's not exactly
your fairy tale wedding.

02:11.024 --> 02:12.159
But I love you.

02:12.192 --> 02:12.993
Tom.

02:13.026 --> 02:15.128
Ya' hate it,
I know I should've...

02:17.863 --> 02:19.232
I love it.

02:20.699 --> 02:22.735
9/23.
What day is that?

02:22.868 --> 02:25.038
It's the day
you stole my heart.

02:27.407 --> 02:28.408
What?

02:32.279 --> 02:34.047
The Honeymoon Phase.

02:34.847 --> 02:37.250
That fleeting feeling
of ecstasy

02:37.284 --> 02:39.219
that young couples
experience.

02:40.187 --> 02:41.887
Why do the feelings fade?

02:42.189 --> 02:44.324
What's the difference
between newly weds

02:44.357 --> 02:47.827
and a couple celebrating
their fiftieth anniversary?

02:47.860 --> 02:49.996
Sex.

02:50.030 --> 02:51.597
Precisely.

02:52.865 --> 02:56.069
So, how long have you two
been married?

02:56.103 --> 02:57.670
About a month.

02:58.438 --> 03:00.373
Well, I hate to sound crass

03:00.407 --> 03:04.677
but statistically your marriage
is likely to fail.

03:05.078 --> 03:05.878
Excuse me?

03:05.911 --> 03:08.848
Sorry.
The science is against us.

03:08.881 --> 03:12.651
It takes a very special
kind of relationship

03:12.685 --> 03:14.387
to outlast biology.

03:15.388 --> 03:17.224
Are you married?

03:20.759 --> 03:22.862
Did biology
get the best of you?

03:22.895 --> 03:25.198
My wife passed away
a long time ago.

03:25.798 --> 03:27.400
- I'm sorry, I...
- She's actually the reason

03:27.434 --> 03:29.236
I began this study.

03:29.269 --> 03:32.738
Why should the
Honeymoon Phase end?

03:32.771 --> 03:34.374
Why can't it last forever.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.278
It should.

03:40.846 --> 03:45.018
Well... today we're here
to determine

03:45.051 --> 03:48.054
if you're viable candidates
for our program here.

03:49.256 --> 03:51.824
Think your marriage
is up to the test?

03:55.328 --> 03:57.097
Absolutely.

03:59.765 --> 04:01.001
Please state your name.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.702
Thomas Henry Jacobs.

04:03.736 --> 04:05.972
- State your name please.
- Evelyn Jacobs.

04:06.006 --> 04:09.708
So Mrs. Jacobs, what's your
favorite thing about Tom?

04:09.742 --> 04:12.179
<i>He's just...
...he's so sweet.</i>

04:12.212 --> 04:14.014
<i>He's really observant, too.</i>

04:15.382 --> 04:16.983
<i>That's what makes him
a great writer.</i>

04:19.452 --> 04:21.387
And your favorite
thing about Eve?

04:21.421 --> 04:22.721
That's easy.

04:23.156 --> 04:24.391
<i>Everything.</i>

04:24.424 --> 04:26.092
Your worst memory together?

04:28.461 --> 04:30.363
<i>We don't have one.</i>

04:31.298 --> 04:33.300
- Hmm.
- Is that a problem?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.068
Favorite memory together?

04:35.768 --> 04:37.103
What?

04:37.370 --> 04:38.704
<i>Just one?</i>

04:41.074 --> 04:42.875
How about your sex life?

04:43.210 --> 04:44.144
What?

04:44.177 --> 04:47.147
Is your husband dominant
or submissive?

04:47.180 --> 04:48.415
<i>Um...</i>

04:48.448 --> 04:49.915
<i>I'm dominant.</i>

04:50.450 --> 04:52.452
I'm pretty...
pretty dominant.

04:53.987 --> 04:55.522
Has Tom changed
since you met him?

04:55.555 --> 04:56.889
Of course.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.824
<i>Everyone changes.</i>

04:58.857 --> 05:00.793
<i>But we'll always
love each other.</i>

05:00.826 --> 05:02.229
It's a vow, right?

05:22.382 --> 05:24.850
I can't concentrate
with you doing that.

05:31.824 --> 05:34.961
Hey, we don't have to do this,
if you don't want to.

05:35.929 --> 05:37.796
No, we're doing this
together.

05:46.239 --> 05:48.807
But hypothetically speaking,
you know,

05:48.841 --> 05:52.212
if things become disadvantageous
to us we should um...

05:53.146 --> 05:55.115
have a code word to stop it.

05:56.149 --> 05:57.883
Like a safe word?

05:58.884 --> 06:01.021
Yes, like a safe word.

06:05.392 --> 06:07.227
9/23.

06:10.964 --> 06:12.865
9/23.

06:14.401 --> 06:17.170
Did you seriously forget to
pack my Tempur-Pedic pillow?

06:17.203 --> 06:18.605
You know I can't
sleep without it.

06:18.638 --> 06:20.573
Julie, do we really have
to do this right here?

06:20.607 --> 06:22.542
Yes, we have
to do this here.

06:23.209 --> 06:25.545
You know, a good husband
would go home and get it.

06:27.013 --> 06:29.249
- Glad we're not them.
- Right.

06:33.987 --> 06:36.256
Welcome everyone

06:36.289 --> 06:38.992
and thank you for being
part of history.

06:39.926 --> 06:41.528
Each and every one of you
were chosen,

06:41.561 --> 06:45.065
not because you relationship
was perfect,

06:45.098 --> 06:46.899
but because it's unique.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.968
Now as you may know...

06:49.002 --> 06:51.971
I once was married too
and my wife Samantha

06:52.005 --> 06:55.508
would be very proud of the work
we're about to begin here.

06:56.209 --> 06:59.612
Now, each couple here will be
separated for final briefing.

06:59.646 --> 07:03.183
I know the process can be
a little intimidating.

07:03.216 --> 07:06.586
I promise you'll all be reunited
very soon.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.423
So, uh,
A spouses will follow

07:10.457 --> 07:12.092
with the doctor on my left.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.860
B spouses with the doctor
on my right.

07:16.930 --> 07:19.065
I hope you all
enjoy your stay here.

07:26.239 --> 07:27.474
Tom, it's good.

07:27.507 --> 07:29.376
You sure?
Because I think that it could...

07:29.409 --> 07:32.145
I have notes.
But it's good.

07:32.178 --> 07:33.613
It's really good.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.084
A spouses,
follow me.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.621
I'll see you soon.

08:14.621 --> 08:19.025
Now, I am going
to countdown from ten.

08:19.058 --> 08:22.162
By the time I reach one...

08:22.195 --> 08:25.365
...you'll be with Mr. Jacobs,
in your new home.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.642
There.

08:37.210 --> 08:41.648
Ten, nine, eight,

08:42.782 --> 08:45.185
seven, six,

08:46.186 --> 08:49.989
five, four,

08:50.023 --> 08:54.494
three, two... one.

09:33.099 --> 09:35.235
Tom. Tom.

09:35.268 --> 09:38.104
<i>Before I had arrived,
I had no idea what to expect.</i>

09:39.339 --> 09:43.443
By the end of all of this,
would she love me,

09:46.079 --> 09:47.647
would I love her?

09:52.785 --> 09:55.255
<i>At the moment I laid eyes
on her I knew.</i>

09:57.123 --> 10:00.460
I had to spend the rest
of my life with here.

10:03.096 --> 10:04.397
Hey.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.165
Hey.

10:23.283 --> 10:24.684
Tom.

10:25.685 --> 10:28.254
<i>Welcome, I'm your Hander,</i>

10:28.288 --> 10:30.690
<i>It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.</i>

10:30.723 --> 10:32.792
<i>Please, come in.</i>

10:37.163 --> 10:38.831
Whoa, what is this?

10:41.267 --> 10:42.802
<i>We call it The Mediator.</i>

10:42.835 --> 10:44.270
<i>It allows me to be with you</i>

10:44.304 --> 10:46.439
<i>without skewing the results
of the study.</i>

10:46.706 --> 10:48.441
That's incredible.

10:48.474 --> 10:50.143
<i>Take a seat.</i>

10:50.510 --> 10:52.445
<i>I'll walk you through
the protocol.</i>

10:59.285 --> 11:02.155
<i>Now, put on your headsets.</i>

11:11.598 --> 11:13.600
<i>Welcome to your orientation.</i>

11:13.833 --> 11:15.768
<i>These headsets will record
your brain waves</i>

11:15.802 --> 11:18.705
<i>as we discuss your experiences
over the next month,</i>

11:18.738 --> 11:22.475
<i>hopefully uncovering the truth
behind The Honeymoon Phase.</i>

11:24.777 --> 11:26.646
<i>We'll start with
something simple.</i>

11:26.679 --> 11:28.181
<i>Question one,</i>

11:28.214 --> 11:29.482
<i>who are you?</i>

11:29.515 --> 11:31.351
I'm Eve Jacobs.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.823
Sorry.
I'm Eve's husband,

11:36.856 --> 11:38.758
Thomas Henry Jacobs.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.860
<i>That concludes Question One.</i>

11:40.893 --> 11:42.762
<i>If you need anything,
I can be reached through</i>

11:42.795 --> 11:44.764
<i>The Mediator at any time.</i>

11:44.797 --> 11:46.766
<i>We'll speak again tomorrow.</i>

11:55.808 --> 11:57.644
Oh...
No way.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.786
What do you want
to listen to?

12:08.321 --> 12:09.822
Whatever you'd like.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.308
Ooo Ooo Oooo

12:29.342 --> 12:30.176
What.

12:31.577 --> 12:33.613
"I've got your picture
on my wall.

12:33.646 --> 12:36.549
"I think...
dream about you when I sleep."

12:36.582 --> 12:37.151
Come on.

12:37.183 --> 12:38.551
"I think..."
Whoa.

12:50.863 --> 12:53.232
Oh, your favorite.

12:59.405 --> 13:01.474
Hmm...
What are these?

13:01.507 --> 13:02.875
Cookies.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.377
Really?

13:04.410 --> 13:05.445
Cookies.

13:05.478 --> 13:07.280
LSD cookies.

13:09.849 --> 13:11.417
My contribution to your book.

13:23.429 --> 13:24.597
Tom!

13:24.630 --> 13:25.933
What?

13:26.833 --> 13:27.767
Mine.

13:44.650 --> 13:45.852
Popcorn.

13:51.824 --> 13:53.326
Vodka.

14:05.872 --> 14:07.406
Chocolate cake.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.045
It's not instant.

15:21.581 --> 15:22.950
Oh my God.

15:54.747 --> 15:56.515
It's perfect.

15:58.618 --> 15:59.919
No.

16:03.556 --> 16:05.158
You're perfect.

16:07.194 --> 16:08.794
I love you...

16:38.557 --> 16:40.027
Get a condom.

17:01.747 --> 17:03.649
You are so beautiful.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.786
Then what are you
waiting for?

18:24.764 --> 18:25.932
Whoa.

18:25.966 --> 18:28.101
That was incredible.

18:33.706 --> 18:35.208
What's wrong?

18:36.776 --> 18:39.745
I'm still processing it all.

18:40.813 --> 18:42.249
Was it too much?

18:43.250 --> 18:45.618
It just wasn't like you.

18:46.719 --> 18:48.821
- I'm sorry I...
- No.

18:48.854 --> 18:50.257
I thought you would
like it rough.

18:50.290 --> 18:53.592
No, it's okay.
It's no one's fault.

18:59.899 --> 19:01.301
Hey.

19:04.037 --> 19:05.305
I love you.

19:06.639 --> 19:08.208
I love you, too.

19:23.023 --> 19:24.790
<i>We're gonna get
through this, babe.</i>

19:31.664 --> 19:32.865
I love you.

19:32.898 --> 19:33.766
Push!

19:35.701 --> 19:37.137
Come on!
Push!

19:37.170 --> 19:39.406
Come on!
Here it comes.

19:42.175 --> 19:43.742
It's coming...

19:46.046 --> 19:47.646
Aw fuck!

19:50.283 --> 19:52.285
Fuck this!

20:00.160 --> 20:02.095
So cute.

20:12.372 --> 20:14.074
Wow.

20:18.878 --> 20:19.980
We should make one.

20:27.053 --> 20:28.955
Wait, you're serious?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.756
Why not?

20:30.789 --> 20:33.193
We're not exactly
parent material.

20:42.469 --> 20:44.703
We can still have sex.

20:47.806 --> 20:49.176
With a condom.

20:50.944 --> 20:53.079
The first week was like
our honeymoon...

20:56.149 --> 20:59.386
until one night
everything changed.

21:09.828 --> 21:11.364
Are you sure they're safe?

21:12.399 --> 21:14.034
I...

21:16.136 --> 21:17.337
I know.

21:20.307 --> 21:21.942
Stop being a wimp.

21:21.975 --> 21:23.742
You've done it before.

21:27.147 --> 21:28.982
Oh wait,
I forgot the drinks.

21:49.936 --> 21:51.904
Oh my brave man.

21:52.439 --> 21:54.341
It's not that bad.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.311
Blah.

22:03.882 --> 22:05.851
I don't feel anything.

22:10.190 --> 22:11.324
<i>One, two...</i>

22:11.358 --> 22:14.127
- Three, four,
- Let go!

22:14.160 --> 22:16.529
- five, six, seven.
- Close your eyes.

22:16.563 --> 22:18.565
Eight.
Twenty-three...

22:18.598 --> 22:19.366
<i>I can hear you.</i>

22:19.399 --> 22:21.867
<i>You're walking
down the hall...</i>

22:24.571 --> 22:27.274
<i>...Two and three quarters.
Nine and three quarters.</i>

22:27.307 --> 22:31.144
<i>31, 32, 33, 34... 60.</i>

22:31.177 --> 22:33.046
<i>Ready or not,
here I come.</i>

22:34.547 --> 22:36.016
<i>I heard that.</i>

22:36.349 --> 22:38.218
<i>I know where you are now.</i>

22:43.623 --> 22:46.359
<i>Come out. Come out,
wherever you are.</i>

22:52.865 --> 22:54.000
Hmm.

22:55.035 --> 22:56.169
<i>I give up.</i>

22:56.936 --> 22:58.305
<i>Come out.</i>

23:01.074 --> 23:02.908
Boo!

23:02.942 --> 23:04.277
Asshole!

23:04.311 --> 23:06.346
Come on,
you love jump scares.

23:06.379 --> 23:08.014
Just go hide.

23:08.048 --> 23:11.618
1, 2, 3, 4.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.320
Alright, alright.
Don't look.

23:13.353 --> 23:18.091
5, 10, 11, 12,

23:18.124 --> 23:22.162
13, 14, 15, 16.

23:24.998 --> 23:26.266
Tom?

23:28.301 --> 23:30.036
<i>Help me!</i>

23:33.673 --> 23:35.608
Somebody help!
Help!

23:36.009 --> 23:37.243
Hey! Open!

23:37.277 --> 23:40.547
Open the door,
he's trying to kill me!

23:41.948 --> 23:44.050
Let me in, please!

23:44.084 --> 23:46.619
- Who's trying to kill you?
- Just let me in!

23:49.422 --> 23:51.324
It's locked, I'll tell Tom.
Hold on!

23:51.358 --> 23:52.392
No, no!

23:52.425 --> 23:54.561
Tom,
I need your help!

23:54.594 --> 23:55.662
Tom!

23:55.695 --> 23:57.430
Let me in please!

23:57.464 --> 23:59.165
Hey!
Unlock the door!

23:59.699 --> 24:02.469
Let me in!
Please!

24:02.502 --> 24:04.037
Tom!

24:23.289 --> 24:25.191
Hey.
Hey, what's wrong?

24:25.592 --> 24:27.961
He killed her.

24:27.994 --> 24:29.329
Who?

24:32.399 --> 24:33.500
Hey, there's nobody there.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.034
He, he killed her.

24:35.068 --> 24:36.035
Babe, wait.

24:36.069 --> 24:38.037
<i>Mrs. Jacobs,
I need you to calm down.</i>

24:38.071 --> 24:39.939
Don't tell me
to calm down okay,

24:39.973 --> 24:41.141
because he killed her!

24:41.174 --> 24:43.042
<i>It's not possible.</i>

24:43.076 --> 24:45.879
Just check the cameras.
Please.

24:52.352 --> 24:54.120
<i>Somebody help!</i>

24:56.556 --> 24:58.258
<i>Open the door!</i>

24:58.291 --> 25:00.360
<i>Can you open the door!</i>

25:13.373 --> 25:14.607
<i>What's wrong!</i>

25:15.775 --> 25:17.310
<i>I checked without Handlers,</i>

25:17.343 --> 25:19.512
<i>every couple in the study
is accounted for.</i>

25:24.684 --> 25:26.486
But I saw them.

25:26.519 --> 25:29.055
I know I saw them.

25:31.024 --> 25:32.759
Babe, hey, hey.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.228
Maybe you just thought you did,
okay?

25:35.261 --> 25:36.496
- No.
- Yeah...

25:37.764 --> 25:40.300
She took some LSD earlier.

25:42.402 --> 25:45.672
<i>Well, that explains
the hallucinations.</i>

25:46.272 --> 25:48.274
<i>Illegal substances were
strictly prohibited.</i>

25:48.308 --> 25:49.542
I know.

25:49.642 --> 25:51.211
I know.

25:51.611 --> 25:53.246
We're sorry.

25:58.151 --> 25:59.519
<i>Mrs. Jacobs...</i>

25:59.552 --> 26:01.254
<i>You're just gonna have to</i>

26:01.287 --> 26:03.623
<i>let the drugs
take their course.</i>

26:37.857 --> 26:39.526
Tom.

26:46.332 --> 26:47.600
Tom!

26:47.634 --> 26:49.469
Sorry, um...

26:49.502 --> 26:51.304
I don't know why
I can't remember the notes.

26:51.337 --> 26:52.705
Then stop.

26:52.739 --> 26:54.207
Please.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.210
Hey, hey, hey.

26:58.578 --> 26:59.612
What's wrong?

26:59.646 --> 27:01.214
I'm just hungover.

27:01.247 --> 27:02.181
Want to lie down?

27:02.215 --> 27:04.317
No, I really need
to get some work done.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.653
- I was thinking...
- About you book?

27:31.778 --> 27:36.449
You know, last night
when I was tripping,

27:37.784 --> 27:40.553
I kept imagining what our kids
would look like?

27:41.321 --> 27:45.391
It just made me really
want to start a family.

27:45.425 --> 27:48.661
Can we talk about this later?
My head is killing me.

27:49.362 --> 27:51.898
Yeah.
I just,

27:51.932 --> 27:54.500
I think it would be
really good for us.

27:54.534 --> 27:56.536
You never felt
that way before.

27:58.404 --> 28:00.173
Well I do now.

28:00.206 --> 28:01.407
We don't have the money.

28:01.441 --> 28:03.176
We're making fifty grand
from this.

28:03.209 --> 28:05.244
- And what happens when we spend that?
- Well I...

28:05.278 --> 28:07.614
Who knows when my visa's
gonna go through,

28:07.647 --> 28:08.715
and then there's
the green card.

28:08.748 --> 28:11.584
- And your fucking book.
- Hey, I'm gonna finish it.

28:11.618 --> 28:13.620
Really Tom, because
half the trip's gone

28:13.653 --> 28:14.687
and you haven't touched it!

28:14.721 --> 28:15.788
I've had writer's block.

28:15.822 --> 28:17.590
Well unblock it.

28:22.295 --> 28:24.263
I'm sorry.

28:24.464 --> 28:25.865
Me too.

28:25.898 --> 28:27.935
I'd help write it if I could.

28:27.968 --> 28:29.569
I know.

28:38.444 --> 28:41.648
Finish your book,
and then we'll talk.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.550
Really?

28:44.584 --> 28:47.487
Yeah.
Just try and write.

28:48.554 --> 28:49.889
Okay.

28:51.491 --> 28:54.394
I'll, uh...
I'll be in my office.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.452
Come in.

29:24.457 --> 29:26.392
I have a surprise for you.

29:31.932 --> 29:33.533
You hate it.

29:33.566 --> 29:36.803
No, not at all.
I love it.

29:38.905 --> 29:40.807
Then spill.

29:50.817 --> 29:52.785
You normally can't go a day
without writing.

29:52.819 --> 29:54.253
What's up?

29:55.288 --> 29:57.557
Is this really the life
we want?

29:57.590 --> 29:59.225
What do you mean?

29:59.859 --> 30:02.963
Me writing?

30:02.996 --> 30:05.398
Not being able
to support a family?

30:05.431 --> 30:07.700
I know what I signed up for.

30:07.734 --> 30:09.669
You write the books.
I'll design the covers.

30:09.702 --> 30:10.870
Remember?

30:11.704 --> 30:14.340
Hey, where'd our
excitement go for that?

30:14.373 --> 30:16.809
Where's the Tom who dreamed
of book signings

30:16.843 --> 30:18.611
and movie deals?

30:18.644 --> 30:21.014
Who believed anything
was possible?

30:21.048 --> 30:23.750
That's the guy
I fell in love with.

30:23.783 --> 30:26.319
Sure, it's gonna be
a rough road ahead

30:26.352 --> 30:30.757
but we're a team no matter
how broke we are.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.632
I'll meet you in bed.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.481
<i>Don't trust Tom.</i>

30:59.352 --> 31:00.653
Hello?

31:05.491 --> 31:06.759
Hello?

31:09.428 --> 31:11.497
Shit, sorry.

31:11.531 --> 31:12.598
You coming?

31:12.632 --> 31:14.534
Yeah, just gonna pee.

31:36.589 --> 31:38.391
Time to unwind.

31:43.496 --> 31:44.797
You gonna join me?

31:44.831 --> 31:46.532
I'm tired.
Tomorrow?

31:48.936 --> 31:50.736
Alright.

32:13.961 --> 32:16.029
You look like you need
a little relaxing,

32:16.063 --> 32:17.763
Mrs. Jacobs.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.070
I love that trip.

32:25.905 --> 32:28.075
Tom, I photoshopped you in.

32:28.108 --> 32:30.476
Yeah, I know.

32:30.509 --> 32:33.746
but that's when you realized
you couldn't live without me.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.652
Is everything okay?

32:39.685 --> 32:41.955
You've been distant
the past few days.

32:41.989 --> 32:43.156
Just because we
haven't had sex,

32:43.190 --> 32:45.491
doesn't mean I'm not okay.

32:45.524 --> 32:46.960
I know,

32:46.994 --> 32:49.896
it's just you know
you can talk to me, right?

32:49.930 --> 32:51.731
Mm-hmm.

33:21.228 --> 33:23.496
Why did you tell me
not to trust Tom?

33:24.897 --> 33:27.034
<i>He is not the man
you think he is.</i>

33:28.501 --> 33:29.702
What do you mean?

33:30.070 --> 33:32.039
<i>You really can't tell?</i>

33:35.042 --> 33:36.909
<i>From your file I didn't think
you'd make it past</i>

33:36.944 --> 33:38.511
<i>the first week.</i>

33:38.544 --> 33:40.047
What are you saying?

33:44.850 --> 33:46.552
<i>Tom's...</i>

34:15.648 --> 34:19.119
Hey, what are you
doing in here?

34:19.987 --> 34:21.587
I can't sleep.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.255
Again?

34:28.860 --> 34:32.531
And uh, what's that
you're holding?

34:33.899 --> 34:35.835
I was hoping it could
put me to sleep.

34:35.868 --> 34:38.205
That's very funny.

34:42.042 --> 34:44.543
You didn't read any,
did you?

34:44.577 --> 34:46.612
It's still pretty rough.

34:47.179 --> 34:50.317
Just the dedication,
it's really sweet.

34:50.350 --> 34:53.753
Well, you are my everything.

34:56.156 --> 34:58.258
Tom, what's going on?

34:58.291 --> 34:59.725
What do you mean?

34:59.759 --> 35:03.829
I know this sounds crazy but,

35:03.863 --> 35:05.898
are you messing with me?

35:07.300 --> 35:08.801
What?

35:08.834 --> 35:10.736
It's just,

35:10.770 --> 35:13.806
the Handler told me
not to trust you.

35:15.275 --> 35:16.243
I'm gonna go talk to her.

35:16.276 --> 35:17.743
No, wait please.

35:17.777 --> 35:19.112
That night that I
hallucinated

35:19.146 --> 35:21.248
you took the drugs too,
right?

35:21.281 --> 35:23.150
Are you being serious?

35:24.317 --> 35:27.154
It's just, you've always
been the anxious one

35:27.187 --> 35:28.355
and you're fine.

35:28.388 --> 35:30.723
You had a bad trip,
it happens.

35:30.756 --> 35:33.026
But how do you know
it wasn't real?

35:33.060 --> 35:35.262
I was with you,
no one was there.

35:35.295 --> 35:37.197
You were barely there.

35:37.230 --> 35:40.866
Eve, listen to yourself,
alright?

35:40.900 --> 35:42.768
If you can't trust me,

35:43.736 --> 35:45.305
maybe our relationship
isn't strong enough.

35:45.338 --> 35:47.040
No, no.
I do trust you,

35:47.074 --> 35:49.809
it's just... ever since
we got to this house,

35:49.842 --> 35:52.845
things have felt... off.

35:52.878 --> 35:54.948
Why would she lie to me?

35:56.950 --> 35:59.086
To get to you,

35:59.119 --> 36:01.354
to drive us apart.

36:02.122 --> 36:05.758
Now this whole thing,
it's one big test.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.962
Hey.

36:09.296 --> 36:11.231
Have I ever
lied to you before?

36:11.965 --> 36:13.166
No.

36:13.366 --> 36:14.367
No.

36:16.369 --> 36:18.338
Then why would I now?

36:23.043 --> 36:24.177
Whatever.

36:24.211 --> 36:26.379
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.983
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

36:42.062 --> 36:43.196
My girl is back.

36:44.998 --> 36:46.732
<i>Good afternoon, Mrs. Jacobs.</i>

36:46.765 --> 36:48.235
<i>Oh, that looks great.</i>

36:48.268 --> 36:50.403
<i>Is there anything
I can assist you with?</i>

36:54.040 --> 36:55.674
Nope.

37:51.498 --> 37:53.266
Jesus!

37:53.300 --> 37:54.833
Eve, you scared me.

37:54.867 --> 37:56.436
I have a surprise for you.

37:56.469 --> 37:58.405
Okay, I'm coming.

38:00.006 --> 38:01.740
Right now?

38:09.349 --> 38:11.251
It's incredible.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.457
How about you unwrap one
of your presents early?

38:36.243 --> 38:39.279
Tom, wait.

38:39.312 --> 38:40.447
Stop.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.015
Stop!

38:45.986 --> 38:47.254
What's wrong now?

38:47.287 --> 38:49.356
That's not how
you kiss me.

38:50.223 --> 38:52.993
I'm kissing you the same way
I always have.

38:53.526 --> 38:55.428
No, it feels different.

39:08.408 --> 39:10.310
What about now?

39:12.279 --> 39:13.879
- Now?
- Please.

39:13.912 --> 39:15.348
- Now?
- Tom, stop.

39:15.382 --> 39:17.550
Ow, fuck!

39:25.091 --> 39:28.328
For days I tried to convince her
that everything was fine...

39:30.230 --> 39:32.132
she wouldn't hear it.

39:39.472 --> 39:41.041
<i>I'll be handling you
and Mrs. Jacobs</i>

39:41.074 --> 39:42.908
<i>from here on out.</i>

39:42.942 --> 39:44.044
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

39:44.077 --> 39:46.279
<i>No.
She's not stable.</i>

39:46.313 --> 39:48.914
<i>She doesn't trust me,
she doesn't trust anything.</i>

39:51.384 --> 39:53.919
<i>She's not the only one
having trouble adjusting.</i>

39:53.953 --> 39:56.356
<i>Well I think she needs help.</i>

39:57.624 --> 39:59.159
<i>We're prescribing her
a light sedative</i>

39:59.192 --> 40:00.960
<i>to help ease her worry.</i>

40:11.271 --> 40:13.106
I'll let you know
how things go.

40:13.373 --> 40:15.108
Who are you talking to?

40:15.141 --> 40:17.077
The Handler,
the mediator rang.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.945
I didn't hear it,
what did she want?

40:18.978 --> 40:21.514
- I called Mr. Jacobs...
- Was I talking to you?

40:23.183 --> 40:24.617
She wanted to talk to me.

40:24.651 --> 40:26.619
Your headset's not on.

40:26.653 --> 40:27.587
Okay.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.522
What have you been
telling her about me?

40:29.556 --> 40:32.359
That I've got a bit
mad recently?

40:32.392 --> 40:33.960
- Have you?
- Fuck you.

40:33.993 --> 40:35.128
You're trying to drug me?

40:35.161 --> 40:36.930
What would give you
that idea?

40:38.965 --> 40:40.467
Eve, come on.

40:49.976 --> 40:50.977
Let me explain.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.011
<i>We're trying to help.</i>

40:52.045 --> 40:53.912
<i>You've been missing
your daily check-ins.</i>

40:53.947 --> 40:55.515
So you drug me?!

40:55.548 --> 40:57.984
I think you're losing
touch with reality.

40:58.017 --> 41:00.186
No.
She's fucking with us, okay.

41:00.220 --> 41:02.655
First she says you're a liar
and now she's your best friend.

41:02.689 --> 41:04.923
<i>Eve, you need to calm down.</i>

41:04.958 --> 41:06.593
Don't tell me to calm down.

41:06.626 --> 41:08.294
She's manipulating us.

41:08.328 --> 41:10.096
- Eve, come here.
- Get off me!

41:10.130 --> 41:12.298
- Come here.
- Get the fuck off me!

41:12.699 --> 41:16.035
You're the one running away,
not me!

42:11.624 --> 42:13.059
Tom!

42:13.092 --> 42:14.594
<i>What's wrong?</i>

42:15.295 --> 42:16.596
Oh my God.

42:16.629 --> 42:18.231
Hey, are you okay?

42:21.568 --> 42:23.503
I think I'm pregnant.

42:25.605 --> 42:26.706
Are you sure?

42:26.739 --> 42:28.508
I keep gaining weight

42:28.541 --> 42:31.511
and I'm in here pissing nonstop.
I'm pregnant...

42:32.645 --> 42:33.980
That's...

42:35.415 --> 42:37.250
...amazing.

42:39.419 --> 42:40.753
Tom.

42:40.787 --> 42:42.622
We're gonna be a family.

42:42.655 --> 42:46.025
Tom, I'm only two weeks late,
look at me.

42:46.059 --> 42:48.361
I need a doctor,
we need to leave.

42:48.394 --> 42:49.329
We can't.

42:49.362 --> 42:52.465
Something is wrong, okay.

42:52.499 --> 42:56.402
To be this far along,
I must've done something.

42:56.436 --> 43:00.106
Hey, which is why
we need to trust them.

43:01.140 --> 43:02.542
What?

43:02.575 --> 43:06.379
No, we need to talk
about our options.

43:08.615 --> 43:10.617
Options?

43:13.820 --> 43:15.722
There are no options.

43:16.756 --> 43:18.691
Experiment or not,
that's my child,

43:18.725 --> 43:21.494
that's our child.

43:21.528 --> 43:24.330
What kind of
a mother are you?

43:24.364 --> 43:26.466
What? Seriously...

43:27.834 --> 43:31.504
We're given the opportunity
of a lifetime.

43:31.538 --> 43:35.241
And you choose now to have
a fucking mental breakdown?

43:35.275 --> 43:36.276
I'm not crazy.

43:36.309 --> 43:39.479
Now, it's almost
Christmas Day.

43:39.512 --> 43:41.281
For the sake of our family,

43:41.314 --> 43:46.719
can you please hold your
prepartum depression shit

43:46.753 --> 43:49.322
together for six more days?

43:51.190 --> 43:54.727
Okay Tom,
whatever you say.

43:58.765 --> 44:00.433
God.

44:03.269 --> 44:05.204
<i>Mrs. Jacobs...</i>

44:08.775 --> 44:10.577
<i>Eve!</i>

44:17.817 --> 44:19.218
Merry Christmas.

44:28.661 --> 44:30.196
This looks awesome.

44:30.229 --> 44:33.166
You hate that film,
I bought it as a joke.

44:47.547 --> 44:49.449
Thanks.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.522
Not making
an effort tonight?

45:29.555 --> 45:31.257
Not for you.

45:43.836 --> 45:46.239
- What about Amber?
- What about no.

45:46.940 --> 45:49.375
We have to talk about it
at some point?

45:49.409 --> 45:51.878
Yeah really, well how is that
book coming along?

45:54.247 --> 45:56.616
<i>You know you're attracted
to a monster.</i>

46:01.287 --> 46:02.455
What are you doing?

46:02.488 --> 46:04.323
I'm bored

46:04.357 --> 46:06.292
What would you like to do?

46:06.325 --> 46:08.494
You don't wanna
finish the movie?

46:08.528 --> 46:10.396
Not if you don't want to.

46:10.430 --> 46:12.231
Well what do you
want to do then?

46:12.265 --> 46:13.466
It doesn't matter.

46:13.499 --> 46:14.634
It does matter, Tom.

46:14.667 --> 46:17.938
Have a opinion that doesn't
involve my body for once.

46:20.373 --> 46:21.975
You're doing it again.

46:22.009 --> 46:23.409
Doing what?

46:23.443 --> 46:25.878
Willing a problem
into existence.

46:25.912 --> 46:27.747
Probably.

46:28.381 --> 46:31.384
Come on, please?

46:34.787 --> 46:36.389
This isn't you.

46:37.657 --> 46:39.960
- Do I need to get you pills?
- No.

46:39.993 --> 46:42.595
Then can we just enjoy
each other's company?

46:43.030 --> 46:45.264
And stop hating me?

46:45.999 --> 46:48.568
Because I love you,
Mrs. Jacobs.

46:48.601 --> 46:50.536
You don't have to say that.

46:51.404 --> 46:53.306
- Say what?
- "Mrs. Jacobs."

46:53.339 --> 46:56.776
Don't confuse me even more,
I'm delusional enough.

46:58.911 --> 47:00.713
I'm gonna make
some more popcorn.

47:27.607 --> 47:28.942
- <i>Good evening, Eve.</i>
- Shh.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.944
I've only got a minute
until he gets back.

47:30.978 --> 47:32.578
We need your help.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.580
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

47:34.614 --> 47:36.549
<i>I can only observe
your marriage.</i>

47:36.582 --> 47:37.884
No, we are not married,
okay.

47:37.917 --> 47:39.585
I don't know what
this experiment is

47:39.619 --> 47:41.821
but I'm six fucking
months pregnant...

47:41.854 --> 47:43.456
<i>Eve.</i>

47:44.457 --> 47:45.892
<i>He's playing you.</i>

49:23.856 --> 49:25.892
Tom, honey?

49:27.194 --> 49:28.728
Just a sec.

49:29.495 --> 49:30.998
I can wait.

49:31.597 --> 49:33.033
What?

49:34.700 --> 49:36.535
I read your book.

49:39.206 --> 49:41.108
All of it?

49:41.507 --> 49:43.076
All of it.

49:45.145 --> 49:46.712
There's a rational
explanation.

49:46.746 --> 49:47.948
Can't wait to hear it.

49:47.981 --> 49:50.549
I haven't felt
inspired to write,

49:50.583 --> 49:52.152
you keep pressuring me.

49:52.885 --> 49:54.720
I'll inspire you then.

49:56.223 --> 49:57.623
Write.

49:58.791 --> 49:59.859
Eve.

49:59.892 --> 50:01.128
Write.

50:01.161 --> 50:03.596
- I can't.
- Write!

50:05.032 --> 50:06.565
Is this how you treat
your husband?

52:02.748 --> 52:04.550
<i>Tom, could you come here?</i>

52:06.019 --> 52:08.188
Yeah, I'll be right there.

52:17.897 --> 52:19.299
Shut the door.

52:22.768 --> 52:24.703
I have an apology to make.

52:27.174 --> 52:29.742
I haven't been
a good partner.

52:30.277 --> 52:32.312
You've been through
a lot this month.

52:35.881 --> 52:37.750
Care to join me?

52:52.865 --> 52:54.667
Should you be drinking that?

52:54.700 --> 52:56.203
One glass won't hurt.

53:02.775 --> 53:04.377
Call it.

53:04.411 --> 53:06.179
Um...

53:07.813 --> 53:10.683
To our family.

53:11.251 --> 53:12.419
To your family.

53:23.964 --> 53:25.764
Lets play a game,

53:25.798 --> 53:27.367
one of your favorites.

53:28.301 --> 53:30.937
- Okay.
- Never have I ever.

53:31.837 --> 53:33.306
You're on.

53:33.340 --> 53:34.941
I'll go first.

53:35.408 --> 53:39.879
Never have I ever
been an American citizen.

53:41.982 --> 53:43.984
Drink.

53:47.988 --> 53:50.923
- Never have I ever.
- What?

53:50.957 --> 53:52.993
Had sex with a man.

53:57.763 --> 53:59.798
Never have I ever
had sex with a woman.

53:59.832 --> 54:02.002
Mm-hmm, yeah.

54:26.193 --> 54:27.928
Shit.

54:29.062 --> 54:31.131
It's okay,
we have more.

54:55.288 --> 54:57.057
I've got another.

54:58.225 --> 54:59.960
Shoot.

55:02.229 --> 55:04.231
Never have I ever...

55:05.932 --> 55:08.101
...tried to get someone
pregnant.

55:13.373 --> 55:16.109
It's okay, I know.

55:19.546 --> 55:21.814
I just wanted a family.

55:22.549 --> 55:24.117
Drink.

55:36.930 --> 55:39.399
Never have I ever
been married.

55:42.302 --> 55:45.005
That's a dumb one.
You drink.

55:47.274 --> 55:49.175
Drink.

55:59.452 --> 56:01.554
9/23.

56:03.123 --> 56:04.124
What?

56:04.157 --> 56:06.092
9/23.

56:08.094 --> 56:09.963
I don't get it.

56:14.567 --> 56:17.070
I'm going to go
get more wine.

56:44.397 --> 56:45.999
Hey.

57:01.147 --> 57:03.183
How about we go to bed?

57:31.578 --> 57:33.179
What are you doing?

57:33.213 --> 57:35.014
I'm cold.

57:37.584 --> 57:39.252
I'll warm you up.

58:10.016 --> 58:13.086
We're married,
kiss me.

58:13.119 --> 58:15.054
We're not married.

58:17.590 --> 58:21.261
I'm... your... husband.

58:21.294 --> 58:22.996
You're not my husband.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.468
Calm down.

58:35.608 --> 58:37.677
Babe, unlock the door.

58:37.710 --> 58:40.480
I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

58:41.648 --> 58:43.716
Let me in, okay.

58:43.750 --> 58:45.985
This is not good
for our baby.

58:47.020 --> 58:49.255
<i>Just open the door.</i>

58:57.063 --> 58:58.431
Let me in!

58:59.332 --> 59:00.667
<i>Eve?</i>

59:07.340 --> 59:08.741
Eve.

59:16.516 --> 59:17.450
I'm coming in!

59:19.552 --> 59:21.020
Eve!

59:32.532 --> 59:33.299
Eve!

59:42.809 --> 59:44.511
Go on, say it.

59:44.544 --> 59:46.779
You're not my husband.

59:46.813 --> 59:48.748
Look at me.

59:48.781 --> 59:52.352
I said, look at me.

59:54.420 --> 59:58.391
If you question
that I am him again,

59:58.424 --> 01:00:00.260
they're gonna see it.

01:00:00.293 --> 01:00:04.364
And this whole experiment
is over.

01:00:04.397 --> 01:00:06.399
So,

01:00:06.432 --> 01:00:08.601
when the lights
come back on,

01:00:08.635 --> 01:00:11.404
you're gonna hug me

01:00:11.437 --> 01:00:15.542
and say I'm sorry
like a good wife.

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:23.182
And if you ever try to hurt
my baby again,

01:00:23.216 --> 01:00:25.351
I'll fucking kill you.

01:00:39.866 --> 01:00:41.601
I'll fucking kill you.

01:00:44.137 --> 01:00:47.206
Shh...
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:49.409 --> 01:00:50.476
I'm sorry.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.412
I know, I know, baby.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.348
It's okay.

01:01:11.197 --> 01:01:13.199
<i>I think it's in
your best interest</i>

01:01:13.232 --> 01:01:14.734
<i>that I terminate your stay.</i>

01:01:14.767 --> 01:01:16.869
- What?!
- Wait why?

01:01:16.903 --> 01:01:19.772
<i>You're both entirely
unfit to continue.</i>

01:01:20.907 --> 01:01:22.575
Tom will help me through it.

01:01:25.278 --> 01:01:27.614
Please, we need this.

01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:34.621
<i>Fine.</i>

01:01:36.923 --> 01:01:39.559
<i>I'm going to prescribe
a stronger sedative</i>

01:01:39.592 --> 01:01:41.494
<i>for the duration
of your stay.</i>

01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:43.830
Thank you.

01:01:45.298 --> 01:01:46.633
Where's our handler?

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:48.701
<i>She's been removed
from the study.</i>

01:01:48.735 --> 01:01:51.537
<i>Why don't we try to proceed
as normal then?</i>

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.375
<i>Question 26.</i>

01:01:55.408 --> 01:01:58.544
<i>How has your spouse changed
over the past month?</i>

01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:10.556
He hasn't.

01:02:31.344 --> 01:02:33.179
Very productive day,

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.581
if I do say so myself.

01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:41.854
I have a surprise for you.

01:02:53.399 --> 01:02:55.301
Put it on.

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:41.581
You know, the past month
has been hard on us.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.384
Let's make tonight the start
of something new.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.609
Eat up.

01:04:14.447 --> 01:04:16.415
Can I have a knife please?

01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:19.819
You don't need one.

01:04:40.439 --> 01:04:41.808
Do you like them?

01:04:45.145 --> 01:04:46.712
They're your favorite.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.652
You can take your medicine
after dinner.

01:04:55.022 --> 01:04:56.856
It's better on
a full stomach.

01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:09.669
You love this song.

01:05:20.646 --> 01:05:22.515
May I have this dance.

01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:52.079
Where's Tom?

01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:56.749
I'm right here.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:58.986
You're not him.

01:06:00.453 --> 01:06:03.123
You need to stop
asking questions

01:06:03.156 --> 01:06:05.591
and accept that
we are a family.

01:06:11.797 --> 01:06:14.400
Let him go
and I'll leave with you.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:18.905
In your condition?

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.742
No.

01:06:22.775 --> 01:06:25.178
Our love would never
survive out there.

01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:28.081
Not yet.

01:06:29.882 --> 01:06:34.520
I know, I've made
a lot of mistakes.

01:06:36.189 --> 01:06:38.858
We stay and we finish
the experiment.

01:06:43.863 --> 01:06:45.831
I want you to know

01:06:48.801 --> 01:06:50.670
that I love you

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.709
and our baby so much

01:07:00.546 --> 01:07:02.882
and you'll learn
to love me, too.

01:07:19.832 --> 01:07:22.735
Why don't you love me?

01:08:40.147 --> 01:08:41.680
<i>Let's move out.</i>

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:00.293
<i>Mapping at 90%.</i>

01:10:25.452 --> 01:10:27.187
Beautiful creatures,
aren't they?

01:10:29.289 --> 01:10:31.057
Monarch butterflies.

01:10:32.092 --> 01:10:33.960
The only known species

01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:36.029
with access to its
genetic memory.

01:10:38.231 --> 01:10:41.101
The key to the perfect clone.

01:10:44.004 --> 01:10:45.671
You cloned Tom?

01:10:46.439 --> 01:10:47.240
Where is he?

01:10:47.274 --> 01:10:49.376
We still need him
as a failsafe

01:10:49.409 --> 01:10:52.912
to fill in any gaps
of his clone's memory.

01:10:52.946 --> 01:10:55.415
You see,
prior to this experiment,

01:10:56.782 --> 01:10:59.386
we can barely map memory
to the brain.

01:11:01.154 --> 01:11:04.090
By using multiple couples
with clone spouses,

01:11:04.124 --> 01:11:07.394
each imprinted with a slightly
different technique.

01:11:09.795 --> 01:11:13.366
We've been able to create
the perfect imprinting map.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.867
I just want Tom.

01:11:17.404 --> 01:11:19.072
I'm sorry.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.241
That's not possible.

01:11:21.274 --> 01:11:24.110
<i>Mapping at 99%.</i>

01:11:25.145 --> 01:11:25.911
No don't...
Stop!

01:11:25.946 --> 01:11:27.846
Why?
One dying doesn't matter.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.482
They all matter to me.

01:11:30.417 --> 01:11:31.518
We'll see.

01:11:31.551 --> 01:11:32.185
Don't!

01:11:33.386 --> 01:11:35.121
Welcome to your orientation.

01:11:35.155 --> 01:11:36.389
Stop! Eve!

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.292
She's not ready.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.494
Stop! Stop!

01:11:41.528 --> 01:11:44.130
Shut up!
All of you drop your weapons.

01:11:44.164 --> 01:11:45.198
Now!

01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:47.067
Do it.

01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:53.039
Kick them over to me.

01:11:55.575 --> 01:11:57.310
<i>Reconnect now.</i>

01:11:59.446 --> 01:12:02.048
Bring... me... Tom.

01:12:02.282 --> 01:12:03.816
Now Eve...

01:12:03.849 --> 01:12:05.252
Bring me Tom!

01:12:06.386 --> 01:12:07.988
Fetch Mr. Jacobs.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.397
Okay Samantha, darling,
it's okay.

01:12:17.998 --> 01:12:19.332
This'll be over soon.

01:12:21.534 --> 01:12:23.203
Jonathan?

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:26.039
Yes, it's me.

01:12:28.174 --> 01:12:29.442
What's going on?

01:12:31.877 --> 01:12:33.346
I brought you back.

01:12:35.582 --> 01:12:38.952
This is your wife,
you sick fuck.

01:12:38.985 --> 01:12:40.287
You wouldn't understand.

01:12:42.289 --> 01:12:43.822
Does she know?

01:12:45.225 --> 01:12:47.227
- Know what?
- No, please don't.

01:12:48.628 --> 01:12:51.197
- That she's a copy.
- No, no, don't listen to her.

01:12:51.231 --> 01:12:52.332
Oh, she doesn't...

01:12:52.365 --> 01:12:54.367
Samantha, you're a clone,

01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:56.002
a knock off
of someone else.

01:12:56.036 --> 01:12:57.504
A fucking experiment.

01:12:57.537 --> 01:12:59.239
A what?

01:13:01.874 --> 01:13:03.909
You experimented on me?

01:13:08.114 --> 01:13:09.848
I had no choice.

01:13:11.651 --> 01:13:14.354
He's been through what?
Dozens of versions of you.

01:13:14.387 --> 01:13:16.423
Why use her
as our Handler?

01:13:18.258 --> 01:13:20.126
To find the perfect one.

01:13:22.262 --> 01:13:23.530
You're her.

01:13:25.198 --> 01:13:27.033
I love you.

01:13:32.405 --> 01:13:34.240
I don't.

01:13:47.687 --> 01:13:49.022
Hey.

01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:51.391
Hey.

01:13:52.992 --> 01:13:54.627
Let him go.

01:14:05.305 --> 01:14:07.941
Samantha honey,
I've got you.

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:10.377
You're gonna be fine.

01:14:36.469 --> 01:14:38.037
Come on.

01:15:05.665 --> 01:15:07.400
We're going to get you
out of here.

01:15:08.435 --> 01:15:09.636
Shit.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.608
Eve!
Get away from him!

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.513
- Hey, hey, whoa.
- Leave her alone!

01:15:22.081 --> 01:15:22.916
If how...

01:15:22.949 --> 01:15:26.419
How do you know
I'm not the real Tom?

01:15:27.086 --> 01:15:29.122
We're both bleeding out!

01:15:29.155 --> 01:15:31.157
They're still fucking with us!

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:45.271
They stabbed me

01:15:45.305 --> 01:15:47.707
when they saw
what you did to him.

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.375
You know it's me.

01:15:51.544 --> 01:15:52.712
Kiss me.

01:15:52.745 --> 01:15:54.013
What?

01:15:54.047 --> 01:15:55.482
Just kiss me.

01:16:11.164 --> 01:16:12.632
You don't know anymore?

01:16:17.604 --> 01:16:19.038
9/23.

01:16:20.773 --> 01:16:23.610
Eve.
9/23 is our safe word.

01:16:23.643 --> 01:16:25.678
They were going to kill you
if I didn't tell 'em.

01:16:25.712 --> 01:16:27.747
I'm the one
who told him that?

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.582
Stop lying to her!

01:16:29.616 --> 01:16:32.652
Please,
you're my everything.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.556
Your favorite color
was crimson.

01:16:36.589 --> 01:16:38.591
- You love horror films.
- Eve!

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:40.226
On my 24th birthday,

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.362
you created a picture
of us together

01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:45.298
in England because you
missed me so much.

01:16:45.331 --> 01:16:47.367
You know it's me.

01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.538
And I proposed to you
that evening.

01:16:51.571 --> 01:16:52.672
Remember?

01:16:52.705 --> 01:16:54.207
We framed the picture

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.343
and it's in a cabinet
beside the bed.

01:16:57.377 --> 01:16:59.178
Eve, he's playing you.

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.282
I told him everything.

01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:07.787
I've been watching him
torture you for a month.

01:17:08.555 --> 01:17:09.789
Cuddling you.

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:12.525
Fucking you.

01:17:14.627 --> 01:17:16.429
Getting you pregnant.

01:17:19.532 --> 01:17:21.200
I'm so sorry.

01:17:37.684 --> 01:17:39.319
What are you doing?

01:17:39.352 --> 01:17:40.853
Eve.

01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:42.355
Wait.

01:17:42.388 --> 01:17:44.090
I can't lose you.

01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:46.826
Do it.

01:17:48.294 --> 01:17:49.729
Eve, do it!

01:17:51.731 --> 01:17:53.566
Don't!

01:18:16.456 --> 01:18:17.757
Why?

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.485
Tom?

01:18:50.523 --> 01:18:52.225
It's me.

01:18:58.698 --> 01:19:00.299
We gotta get out of here.

01:19:02.402 --> 01:19:03.603
Tom.

01:19:11.344 --> 01:19:12.679
Fuck.

01:19:21.254 --> 01:19:22.956
<i>Eve lost the baby.</i>

01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:32.665
But we managed
to escape alive.

01:19:36.869 --> 01:19:38.371
Finally, her visa
went through

01:19:38.404 --> 01:19:41.607
and we were able
to start again.

01:19:45.678 --> 01:19:48.381
<i>Tom, place the ring
on Eve's finger</i>

01:19:48.414 --> 01:19:50.216
and make your vows to her.

01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:55.588
I Tom,

01:19:55.621 --> 01:19:58.458
take thee, Eve,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

01:19:59.993 --> 01:20:02.528
To have and to hold,
from this day forward,

01:20:04.831 --> 01:20:06.666
for better or for worse,

01:20:08.701 --> 01:20:11.270
for richer or for poorer,

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:13.473
in sickness
and in health,

01:20:14.507 --> 01:20:16.676
for as long
as we both shall live.

01:20:17.477 --> 01:20:20.680
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:20:20.713 --> 01:20:22.515
Tom, you may kiss the bride.

01:20:34.894 --> 01:20:36.329
She was mine.

01:21:23.076 --> 01:21:24.877
You are beautiful.

01:21:57.443 --> 01:21:59.345
Get a condom.

01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:02.548
Are you sure?

01:22:02.582 --> 01:22:04.884
I want to have sex
with my husband.

01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:37.483
You okay?

01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:38.885
Yeah.

01:23:33.572 --> 01:23:37.077
We were supposed
to be a family.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.821
I love you.

01:24:11.244 --> 01:24:12.878
Eve?

01:24:24.557 --> 01:24:25.192
No.

01:24:25.225 --> 01:24:26.692
No, no, no.

01:24:26.726 --> 01:24:28.561
No, no.
No.

01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:32.099
Come on, babe.

01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:33.934
Come... on.

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.173
Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:24:44.643 --> 01:24:46.213
Please.

01:24:54.254 --> 01:24:55.855
Fuck!

01:24:55.888 --> 01:24:58.158
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:59.059 --> 01:25:00.793
Fuck!

01:25:37.097 --> 01:25:38.898
I don't know why she did it,

01:25:43.736 --> 01:25:45.172
we had the perfect life.

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.079
I was the perfect husband.
