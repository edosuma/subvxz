00:38.473 --> 00:41.389
Did someone say
"steamed broccoli"?

00:43.347 --> 00:45.219
I wish to immerse
the tiny green trees

[Cyborg] To steam the broccoli
to the perfect soft texture,
five minutes.

Plus two additional minutes
to bring that water

seven minutes total.

What is this "montage"?

01:13.421 --> 01:16.902
It's a filmmaking technique
that was pioneered by Soviet
director Sergey Eisenstein

01:16.946 --> 01:19.209
to condense long,
potentially-boring periods
of repetitive action

01:19.253 --> 01:21.168

of time.

you're gonna tell us.

Yes. I will explain
in full detail how
we came to this point,

07:21.397 --> 07:23.747
and why your use of montages
was a mistake.

Anything we skipped past
doing in our montage
never actually got done.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.743
It was just the illusion
of results,

08:02.786 --> 08:05.397
but real results
come from real work.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.968

there are none
of the shortcuts.

And we owe you the apology.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.495
No time!
We still have to stop Katarou.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.628
But how can we possibly
defeat him?

08:18.672 --> 08:21.065
With a crane kick.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.764
Uh, we never learned how,
remember?

08:23.807 --> 08:25.417
I will teach you properly
this time.

08:25.461 --> 08:28.072
How will we learn it in time
to defeat the Katarou.

08:28.116 --> 08:32.773
With another
filmmaking device, a dissolve.

08:32.816 --> 08:37.342
It's another way to show
the passage of time without
the flashiness of a montage.

Can we get on with this?

Don't worry, Katarou,
we are going to defeat you
very, very slowly.
