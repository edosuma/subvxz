WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.639
- ( music playing )
- ( seagull screeching )

00:14.682 --> 00:18.352
Donna:
On our network, users can
already have a conversation,

00:18.386 --> 00:21.689
send mail,
share information,
connect.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.592
But this promises
to be far more.

00:24.625 --> 00:28.062
This is the world's first
virtual handshake deal.

00:28.096 --> 00:31.132
- A trade.
- A trade made
on your computer

00:31.165 --> 00:33.334
that swaps tangible items
between users.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.836
You get everything
you want without ever
leaving your home.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.705
You do everything
from your keyboard.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.840
The only person
you'll ever see
is the mailman.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.310
We're looking
for the right partner.

00:42.343 --> 00:46.380
We've currently got
100,000 dedicated users
and we're growing,

00:46.414 --> 00:50.251
so expansion like this
requires another level
of funding.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.453
We need to add
more bodies to
the coding team,

00:52.486 --> 00:54.822
- enhance our interface,
and purchase--
- How much?

00:54.855 --> 00:58.859
In the back of our
prospectus you'll find
a detailed breakdown of--

00:58.892 --> 01:01.562
I saw the number.
I'd just like to hear it
said out loud.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.697
( chuckles )

01:03.731 --> 01:05.699
$1.4 million.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.169
Donna:
Our base is loyal

01:08.202 --> 01:10.238
and costs only rise
in success.

01:10.271 --> 01:14.408
So our churn rate, page 25,
and our burn rate, 26,

01:14.442 --> 01:16.444
are practically
nonexistent.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.647
In its first year alone,
we believe Mutiny Exchange

01:19.680 --> 01:23.584
will see upwards
of a half a million deals.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.087
Today, we're offering you
the opportunity to make
the first one.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.261
Told you, Mac.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.329
You were right.
First-rate.

01:35.363 --> 01:39.733
( clears throat )
Best I've heard in a while.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.436
Why am I one
of the last to hear it?

01:44.305 --> 01:47.775
Because we've been
assessing the VC
landscape--

01:47.808 --> 01:50.311
I've heard you've been
up and down Sand Hill Road
with this.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.581
Well, we're new in town.
We're hungry and we want
to move fast.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.283
Okay, I get that.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.686
Our portfolio
is 27 companies deep
as of Q2 '86.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.921
We are in on 3Com
and Cisco and--

02:00.954 --> 02:03.824
shit, Tim, that reminds me,
I gotta call Sandy back.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.794
One of your best
was Oracle.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.498
IPO'd last month,
two million shares,
$55 a pop.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.167
Sure did.
Larry made us $55 million.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.203
Are you telling me
you could do the same?

02:15.236 --> 02:18.672
Well, lend us
1.4 of that 55
and we'll show you.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.545
We've been burned
in the past.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.380
We will throw
our hat in the ring

02:26.414 --> 02:28.882
only to have
our offer shot up
and down the Valley.

02:28.916 --> 02:33.221
I don't like games
and I don't want to be
used as a stalking horse.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.924
If we were to move on this
and give you a term sheet,

02:36.957 --> 02:39.960
we'd want a no-shop
in return.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.563
We wouldn't be here
if we weren't ready
to do business.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.886
Excuse me,
Mr. MacMillan, sir.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.489
If I can have
a moment of your time.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.492
Sir.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.797
3,000 to one.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.600
Those are the odds
of getting hit by lightning
in your lifetime.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.403
They're also the odds
of getting hit by
a computer virus.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.606
But in, like, five years,
those odds are gonna
go way up.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.608
For-- for viruses,
not lightning.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.543
But that's why your work
is so critical.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.745
Because people
are focused on today

03:31.779 --> 03:33.747
and you're already
into tomorrow.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.650
- Do you have a name?
- Yeah, of course.
It's Ryan.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.851
Ryan Ray.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.787
Ryan, it's 52 degrees
in that water.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.390
I'm gonna get into
some dry clothes.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.924
I work for Mutiny

03:43.957 --> 03:46.494
with Cameron Howe
and Gordon Clark.

03:46.527 --> 03:50.898
MacMillan Utility
is basically Sonaris
virus with lipstick.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.335
And only two KLOCs
out of 452 separate it.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.470
And those two KLOCs
completely changed

03:56.504 --> 03:58.672
the functionality
and purpose of
the entire program.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.708
It's completely amazing.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.977
And, you know,
I pulled it apart
in less than a day.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.614
Trying
to impress me, Ryan?

04:06.647 --> 04:09.016
Uh, yeah, that was
sort of the point.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.851
Can I ask you a question?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.520
Yeah, sure, anything.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.659
The Bay Area has 13 breaks
worth surfing.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.462
How many did you go to
before you found me?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.797
Honestly? Four.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.468
11.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.836
( engine starts )

04:41.749 --> 04:44.618
( theme music playing )

05:14.815 --> 05:17.685
12 days and the same old
song and dance.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
He's still working on Mac.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.690
Okay, so then Tim's
either full of shit
or he's got no juice.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.526
Harpor was our last shot.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.129
We've got a couple
more meetings, but they're
smaller boutique firms.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.599
If we get denied first-round
funding across the board,

05:31.632 --> 05:35.569
then it'll be impossible
to get that stink off
no matter what we do next.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.539
I don't get it.
The idea is great.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.774
The prospectus kicks ass
every meeting we've gone into.

05:40.808 --> 05:44.545
14 VC firms and nobody's
stepped up, why?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.614
Well, these clowns
love to make you wait.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.849
They think it gives them
some kind of an allure.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.585
But it just takes one of them
to ask you to the dance.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.021
God, I love how even
the metaphors in this
business are sexist.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.990
We can hit them
with all the data and
all the hard facts we want,

05:57.024 --> 05:59.893
but the minute we walk in there,
they still see just one thing.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.095
You guys can't take
this stuff so personally.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.865
- But this company is us.
- Well, just give it time.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.835
Bos, we haven't
heard back from a single
investor in weeks.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.903
Bosworth:
What do you
want me to say?

06:09.937 --> 06:13.073
Look, the fact that
you two are women I'm sure
doesn't help matters.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.112
I think I liked it better
when you were lying to us.

06:19.146 --> 06:23.817
These smiling VCs
out here love to grin
and screw you, don't they?

06:23.851 --> 06:26.654
At least in Texas
they stab you in the front.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.155
- ( knocks )
- What?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.724
Tim Hankel
from Harpor Capital.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.931
( clears throat )

06:37.965 --> 06:40.668
Tim, hey, have you
heard from Mac yet

06:40.701 --> 06:44.004
or do I have to keep
calling you until you take out
a restraining order on me?

06:44.037 --> 06:46.206
- ( chuckles )
- Tim: Ha, I know, I know.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.042
I'm sorry
it's taking so long,
but it was worth it.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.044
We are a go.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.848
I told you I'd get Mac on board
and I'm a man of my word.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.150
He just got back from Aspen,
but he's off to LA tomorrow,

06:57.184 --> 06:59.853
so he wants something
in place before he leaves.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.955
You two free to talk
first steps tonight?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.661
Yes, let me
check my schedule
and get back to you.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.863
- ( laughs )
- ( cheering )

07:09.897 --> 07:11.799
"So Sad" playing

07:20.240 --> 07:23.176
* If you had
the right spot *

07:23.210 --> 07:26.647
* And you can see
the sky... *

07:26.680 --> 07:29.917
No, you can do that
without the GOTO statements.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.820
And it's always better
without spaghetti branching.

07:32.853 --> 07:37.224
Structured programing.
Böhm-Jacopini style.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.628
Böhm-Jacopini.
You got it.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.163
Yeah,
I'll write it down.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.634
Walking the floor,
not really working,
wearing a tie.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.936
You looking
to become management?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.605
What?
No, no.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.808
I got another bullshit
deposition today.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.045
Going in tomorrow, too.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.514
MacMillan lawsuit?

08:00.548 --> 08:02.049
Yep.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.951
That's three
already this month.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.953
Dogget:
Is that intimidating?
Getting grilled

08:05.986 --> 08:09.523
with Joe MacMillan
staring at you with
those eyes of his?

08:09.557 --> 08:12.893
No, he's not there.
It's just me and
the lawyers.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.028
More boring than brutal.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.532
You know, they ask you
the same stupid questions

08:18.566 --> 08:21.134
over and over,
hoping you'll slip up.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.304
Give anything if it was
to be over so I can collect
the damn check already.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.808
That'd be sweet.
Better brush the nacho dust
off your tie first.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.077
( coders laugh )

08:30.110 --> 08:32.045
Bosworth:
Okay, gentlemen.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.816
Gentlemen, it's that time
of the week again.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.952
- ( coders groan )
- Bosworth: I know.
I love it, too.

08:40.888 --> 08:44.057
All right, I need
some clarification
on your supply needs

08:44.091 --> 08:47.861
because, well,
there was a bit
of confusion last time.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.598
After we made the deal
with Hayes for the 2400s,

08:50.631 --> 08:53.033
I got on the phone with
the fella from Fulfillment

08:53.066 --> 08:57.337
and he asked
if I wanted those
additional RS-232 cables

08:57.370 --> 09:00.708
to which I,
per your wise
instruction, reply,

09:00.741 --> 09:04.011
"No, sir, those are
not the droids that
I'm looking for."

09:04.044 --> 09:06.079
( laughing )

09:06.113 --> 09:08.982
So after he got done
laughing his ass off,

09:09.016 --> 09:11.719
he explained that someone
must be messing with me.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.254
Well done, boys.
I appreciate it.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.023
Moving on.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.226
All right, I need an update
on the graphics extension

09:19.259 --> 09:21.662
for the Mutiny Exchange demo
y'all are working on

09:21.695 --> 09:25.633
and how it will
interface with existing
neighborhood graphics.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.735
We have the sprite engine
mostly working,

09:27.768 --> 09:30.638
but we still have a problem
with the scan line rendering.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.205
Yeah, we're getting
a tile map cache miss,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.941
so we're losing
synchronization
on the palette.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.843
Okay, well, hold it.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.078
So is the thing
with the palette
connected to the--

09:38.111 --> 09:40.748
- ( pounds table )
As I said last time...
- Hey.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.684
...we should be using
a blitter on a bitmap
so we can do it in software

09:43.717 --> 09:46.253
and not freeze out devices
that don't have support
for hardware sprites.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.689
Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Are we
in agreement here?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.390
You're talking
about a whole new
change of course.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.860
Doesn't matter.
Just scribble down
what we say,

09:52.893 --> 09:54.895
give it to Cameron,
she'll understand what
we're talking about

09:54.928 --> 09:56.129
and stop wasting
our time.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.409
You know, I'm not sure
I got all that.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.378
See, sometimes
I'm a bit slow.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.182
Need things repeated
to me twice.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.985
Why don't you stand up
and say that to my face?

10:18.018 --> 10:21.621
You want to stand
right up and repeat
that to my face, son?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.826
Hey, Bos.
Bos, you got a sec?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.795
Real quick.
Bos.

10:31.865 --> 10:36.136
Hey, listen, look, I know
you hate these meetings.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.972
Oh, yeah, compared
to a prostate exam, no,
I positively love them.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.974
- Look, this is not
my forte, Gordon.
- I understand.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.043
The girls got
their plates full,
but Cameron says,

10:43.076 --> 10:45.813
- "Bos, you want to come in"--
- Okay, okay, let me run them.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.848
Okay? I speak
their language,

10:47.881 --> 10:50.818
so they can't mess with me
and it could be more efficient.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.720
Look, I'm not trying
to step on your toes--

10:52.753 --> 10:54.421
Wake me
if there's a problem.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.201
- Gordon.
- Yeah?

11:08.235 --> 11:12.039
Um, thanks for
having my back.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.941
Yeah, sure.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.675
Listen...

11:18.178 --> 11:21.014
I know what it's like
to be the smartest
guy in the room

11:21.048 --> 11:25.118
and I also know it's a waste
of time trying to prove it.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.855
Let your work
speak for itself

11:27.888 --> 11:29.757
and be open
to the possibility

11:29.790 --> 11:31.491
that people that
don't understand you,

11:31.524 --> 11:33.994
they're not necessarily
trying to get in your way.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.264
How can I if no one
can see the work?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.733
I have ideas.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.069
Real ideas.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.505
They might sound
theoretical,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.207
but I can make
them happen.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.243
I told Cameron and Donna,
but they didn't even listen.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.914
They just had Bos
pay me to shut up.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.152
What ideas?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.520
"Bonna Rue" playing

12:00.553 --> 12:02.422
Mac:
On the way back
to the lodge,

12:02.455 --> 12:05.358
Dawkins says,
"Let's make snow angels."

12:05.392 --> 12:08.996
He lies down in the snow,
sticks out his arms,

12:09.029 --> 12:12.900
and then passes out
just drunk as a skunk.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.535
We called him Snow Jesus
the rest of the trip.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.271
( laughter )

12:18.305 --> 12:20.908
Okay, glad you had
a good ski thing.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.344
Tim said that you wanted
to discuss first steps.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.479
- I want to level with you.
- Donna: Okay.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.516
- I'm sure you heard about
AT&T axing Viewtron.
- Oh, yeah.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.120
Some folks in town
think that is the end
of online newspapers,

12:33.153 --> 12:36.790
but I have got some insight
into what's really going on
over at Knight Ridder

12:36.824 --> 12:40.794
and I think that
just real opportunity
is being vacated there.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.097
Which means?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.466
Which means I'm gonna
go in big on videotex.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.969
It's gonna tie up
more of our capital,

12:49.002 --> 12:52.205
which also means
I don't think I can do 1.4.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.474
I'm sorry.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.177
- Oh.
- Oh, so...

12:57.210 --> 12:58.979
it's a pass, then.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.848
No, hold on.
It's not that
black and white.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.249
We still want you
in the portfolio.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.118
Your concept has
just great potential.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.254
And, honestly,
the two of you,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.189
- really sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.992
- Oh, thank you, but--
- Tim, you want to walk
them through it?

13:12.025 --> 13:14.161
Yeah, okay,
so we can't do 1.4,

13:14.194 --> 13:17.330
but what if we aim
for a leaner, meaner
Mutiny Exchange?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.299
- You mean cheaper?
- No, smarter.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.234
Doing more with less.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.170
Like, for instance,
I think you can make do

13:23.203 --> 13:25.939
with half as many
new hires as you have
laid out in the prospectus.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.109
Yeah, and I think you can skip
the server computer upgrades,
at least initially.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.879
Less risk, more reward.
It's a surefire way to go.

13:31.912 --> 13:35.048
- Does that sound good?
- You know, let's just
hold off on the--

13:35.082 --> 13:37.350
just for a second.

13:37.384 --> 13:41.288
What I'm hearing is that
you want to lock us up

13:41.321 --> 13:43.590
by investing a fraction
of what we're asking.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.625
No, you're misinterpreting
what we're saying.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.161
Oracle was the same deal.
Investment grew over time.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.230
It's how things
get done out here.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.100
Okay, so then how much money
are you offering us?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.602
Mac:
That is a number that we are
still trying to figure out.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.038
That's what
this was all about,
getting the ball rolling,

13:58.071 --> 14:00.540
assuming that
you are amenable.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.076
Well, we've put a lot
of thought into this

14:03.110 --> 14:05.045
and there really
isn't much fat.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.180
Yeah, you know,
there's no fat.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.617
Well, ahem, you two
are new to the Valley

14:10.650 --> 14:14.087
and I know you want
everything that you want
right away.

14:14.121 --> 14:18.425
But out here, funding
is like doubles tennis.

14:18.458 --> 14:23.096
- Mm-hmm.
- You got to know who
you're partnering with.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.598
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you trust each other?

14:25.632 --> 14:28.135
Do you play well
together?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.470
Is it a good fit?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.244
And that's not easy to know
after just one meeting

14:37.277 --> 14:39.079
or even over dinner.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.448
Yeah, listen,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.551
we both know that success
in this industry comes
down to timing.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.954
We have to be first
to market,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.455
and without
sufficient funding,

14:48.488 --> 14:50.557
our ability to do so
is seriously compromised.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.959
And then we all lose.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.261
I hear that,
but let's just...

14:54.294 --> 14:57.230
( exhales )
just take a beat,

14:57.264 --> 15:00.133
enjoy our meal,
see how the evening goes.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.003
And then maybe I will
look into cutting you

15:03.036 --> 15:05.038
a good-faith check
in the morning.
( chuckles )

15:10.143 --> 15:11.644
I'm gonna pop out
for a call.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.580
Just think it over.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.355
I thought this
was a serious meeting.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.325
- We are serious.
- What the hell was that?

15:25.358 --> 15:28.728
It was an opportunity
for you guys to jump to
the front of the line.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.463
Isn't that what you wanted?

15:32.332 --> 15:35.702
Wow, okay, my apologies
if he misread things.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.971
What could he have
possibly misread?

15:38.005 --> 15:40.173
We have been nothing
but professional.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.210
Are you kidding?
You guys call every day
for two weeks.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.146
You drop everything
the night he calls
you to dinner.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.548
And I'm sorry,
but nobody wears
that shade of lipstick

15:48.581 --> 15:50.950
unless they
have come to play.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.257
We're going.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.629
No, you know what?
I'm going to tell him---

16:12.172 --> 16:14.241
- ( chatter )
- ( phones ringing )

16:17.510 --> 16:19.346
Joe:
I want our discs
available beyond stores

16:19.379 --> 16:21.281
aimed at the computer crowd.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.750
What's the point
of making something free
if no one can find it?

16:23.783 --> 16:27.687
Listen, be creative.
We're after first-time
PC users.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.690
We should be
in grocery stores,
video stores, malls.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.659
We want to be
everywhere they are.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.327
I want people
sick of seeing us

16:34.361 --> 16:36.763
the same way I'm sick
of seeing you. Go.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.547
( keyboard clacking )

16:56.349 --> 16:58.385
Joe:
Cynthia!

17:03.523 --> 17:05.525
( door opens )

17:13.566 --> 17:16.169
- Are you Ryan Ray?
- Yeah.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.105
Mr. MacMillan
will see you.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.287
Every day this week
at 9:00 A.M.,

17:34.321 --> 17:36.589
I've got a meeting
scheduled with Ryan Ray.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.729
How long
did this take you?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.697
Two hours.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.234
Okay, you're here.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.636
You've gone to a lot
of trouble to be here.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.404
You've got three minutes.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.874
Okay, then I'll cut
to the chase.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.577
I want to work
at MacMillan Utility.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.712
Want is very different
than need.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.882
- Okay, I need
to work here.
- Why?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.485
Because I'm fascinated
by antivirus software.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.254
I'm not.
It bores me.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.756
Okay, um, because you set
the gold standard

18:09.789 --> 18:12.192
and you're looking
for your next challenge.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.861
- I am, too.
- What makes you think you
know what I'm looking for?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.696
I don't.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.232
Yeah, that was presumptuous.
Only you know that.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.901
What makes you think
I know what I'm looking for?

18:21.934 --> 18:25.872
Because you're brilliant.
Wait, don't you?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.641
I mean, you don't
have to answer that.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.244
Why would you? I
just--

18:31.278 --> 18:34.181
Whatever you
want to do next,
I'm in.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.554
This is a test
and that was the wrong
answer, right?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.295
This is a test and that
was the right answer?

18:50.197 --> 18:51.831
I don't know what
you want me to say.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.734
Whatever you actually
came here to say.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.170
I can't imagine
that I've heard it yet.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.506
I feel like you're judging me.
It doesn't matter what I say.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.342
Even when you're not talking,
you seem disappointed.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.211
You could ask me
what color the sky is

19:04.244 --> 19:06.946
and I would say blue
and somehow I'd be wrong.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.148
You would be.
It's overcast.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.687
You plucked Gordon Clark
out of obscurity, right?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.456
He was nothing
before he met you.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.758
I know him.
I work with him.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.493
So you keep saying.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.828
I'm just as good as he is

19:21.861 --> 19:25.432
and a hard worker
with initiative.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.968
I learned you surfed,
so I woke up at 5:00
in the morning

19:29.001 --> 19:32.939
for two weeks straight
and cased 11 beaches
to find you.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.275
I hacked
a security company.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.644
Your security company.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.712
Doesn't any
of that prove that...

19:43.883 --> 19:46.353
Okay, this is gonna
sound weird

19:46.386 --> 19:47.987
and I feel ridiculous
even saying this,

19:48.020 --> 19:51.491
but I know
that something's coming.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.560
Something big.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.564
Like a train and all I want
is to jump on board.

19:57.597 --> 20:01.501
But it's getting faster
and faster and I'm terrified
that I'm gonna miss it.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.737
That night--
that night that you
spoke at the Castro,

20:04.771 --> 20:06.906
I was like,
finally,

20:06.939 --> 20:10.243
somebody sees
the world the way I do.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.546
And I knew right then
that this was my ticket
on that train.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.317
I don't know what else
to tell you, man.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.820
I just want
to work with you--
need to work with you.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.356
On anything.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.757
Please.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.427
Nobody listens to me.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.762
No one takes me
seriously.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.231
I don't want to get
left behind.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.280
Your three minutes
are up.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.295
You look great.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.465
( door opens )

21:05.498 --> 21:07.467
Mrs. Clark,
Miss Howe.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.835
Follow me.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.677
Thank you.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.546
We're just going
right down there.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.381
Oh.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.818
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.754
- Okay.
- Should we sit?

21:27.787 --> 21:29.689
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:29.722 --> 21:33.693
- Oh, Diane.
- Donna, hi.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.795
Oh, my God,
I feel so stupid.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.898
I had no idea
you were the Gould
in Amador Gould Gilson.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.800
Small world.
Smaller valley.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.769
But this is great.
Now we don't have
to waste time

21:42.802 --> 21:44.471
exchanging pleasantries
or small talk.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.339
- Except for...
- Yes, Cameron Howe.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.042
Oh, Diane is a mom
at Joanie's school.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.878
Okay.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.846
Oh, wait, the mom
of the girl that
Joanie beat up?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.583
I heard it was
more of a draw.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.618
( laughs )

21:58.651 --> 22:01.120
This is Elias Amador.
He'll be joining us.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.556
Hello.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.526
Full disclosure,
I haven't had time
to read this,

22:06.559 --> 22:09.328
but love how you've
grown Mutiny and can't wait
to hear what you've got.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.434
I can't tell you
what a nice change
this is,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.869
pitching to
a familiar face
and Elias.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.942
- Shall we just...?
- Whenever you're ready.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.081
Imagine a place
you could go

22:29.115 --> 22:32.819
where whatever your passion,
whatever you collect or love,

22:32.852 --> 22:35.688
it's available to you
at the push of a button.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.658
A rare Spider-Man comic,
a bootleg Dylan concert,

22:38.691 --> 22:42.929
first edition Fitzgerald,
even a hard-to-find part
for your Apple II.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.599
- It's all there.
- You don't have to scour
the local flea market.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.835
On the chance that
they might have it.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.604
- Or hit every garage sale.
- On the chance that they
might have it.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.706
Or even leave your home.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.108
Cameron:
Because you're connecting
to people across the country

22:56.142 --> 22:58.645
- who are all part of--
- Let me stop you right there.

22:58.678 --> 23:02.181
Everything you're saying
sounds terrific, but just
to cut to the chase,

23:02.214 --> 23:05.985
you're shifting your core
business from chat
to trade, yes?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.787
No, not shifting.
We're expanding.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.657
And it isn't the first time.
We started with games.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.626
We noticed that our users
were chatting during games,

23:13.660 --> 23:16.896
so we moved into chat
and our base jumped
exponentially.

23:16.929 --> 23:20.500
And then we noticed
that our users were
trading during chat,

23:20.533 --> 23:24.003
so we go where the user
behavior takes us.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.073
It's our business model
and it's proven to be
highly effective.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.476
Right, just to be clear,
though,

23:29.509 --> 23:33.012
your expansion is predicated
on the idea of swapping goods
through a BBS?

23:33.045 --> 23:35.181
- Yes.
- Yes, exactly.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.017
Elias, anything
you'd like to ask?

23:38.050 --> 23:40.787
I'm good.
Thank you.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.822
Okay, thank you
for coming in.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.625
Our pleasure.
We'll look forward to--

23:45.658 --> 23:47.126
But I'm afraid
it's a pass.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.828
I'm sor--
I don't understand.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.663
Don't you want to at least
look at the numbers?

23:50.697 --> 23:52.565
No, sorry.

23:55.668 --> 23:59.639
Okay, well, thank you
for your time.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.474
Thank you.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.510
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yeah.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.818
Unbelievable.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.920
So much for sisters
doing it for themselves.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.524
Jesus, they say the next best
thing to a yes is a quick no.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.891
You can't get
much quicker than that.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.027
Yeah, well, that was
too goddamn quick.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.763
It's like she made up
her mind when she saw
it was me.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.039
No, she didn't.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.250
Aaron:
Mr. Clark, you created
the Sonaris virus

24:44.283 --> 24:47.153
that took down WestNet,
yes?

24:47.186 --> 24:50.256
No, I created a fetch program
to detect network size.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.058
Due to an error,
it self-propagated.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.594
I had nothing to do
with it infecting WestNet.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.564
But it's your contention
that the MacMillan
antivirus software

24:57.597 --> 24:59.632
is a variation
of this fetch program?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.668
No, no, it's not
a variation.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.671
Only two kilo lines of code
out of 452 were changed.

25:04.704 --> 25:08.240
I know this because
I changed them myself and
hand-delivered it to Joe.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.710
Yes, he may have added
some bells and whistles
since then,

25:10.743 --> 25:13.646
but, come on,
he's not fooling anyone.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.282
Aaron:
When you say you
hand-delivered the program,

25:16.315 --> 25:18.651
was that a gift
or a transaction?

25:18.685 --> 25:22.088
Aren't gifts a type
of transaction?

25:22.121 --> 25:23.823
You give a gift
to a friend.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.793
You have a transaction
with a business partner.

25:26.826 --> 25:30.697
Okay, did you
just make that up
or is that a real thing?

25:32.699 --> 25:36.736
Mr. Clark, at what
address did you live

25:36.769 --> 25:39.105
on the date
of July 30, 1985?

25:39.138 --> 25:43.042
Same address that I lived at
on February 17, 1985,

25:43.075 --> 25:47.079
and January 27, 1985,
and May 1, 1985,

25:47.113 --> 25:49.315
and every other date
that you've asked me about.

25:49.348 --> 25:53.119
Could you please
repeat the address?

25:53.152 --> 25:57.089
2824 DePue Drive,
Richardson, Texas.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.860
And did Mr. MacMillan
visit you

26:00.893 --> 26:03.596
at your residence
at 2824 DePue Drive

26:03.630 --> 26:06.032
on July 30, 1985?

26:06.065 --> 26:08.000
Yes.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.870
And how did he know that
you lived at said address?

26:10.903 --> 26:12.805
Because he had
been there before.

26:12.839 --> 26:15.074
And why had he
been there before?

26:15.107 --> 26:18.611
Because we were
business partners.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.847
And friends?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.049
Yeah, and friends.

26:24.651 --> 26:29.155
So, when he visited you
on July 30, 1985,

26:29.188 --> 26:32.291
at 2824 DePue Drive,

26:32.324 --> 26:36.328
was that as a business
partner or a friend?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.264
I don't know.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.199
You'd have to ask him.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.934
From your perspective.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.970
From my perspective?

26:44.003 --> 26:47.173
From my perspective,
Joe MacMillan does things
for one reason

26:47.206 --> 26:49.642
and one reason only
and th--

26:49.676 --> 26:52.845
Hey, excuse me,
we are right--

26:52.879 --> 26:56.983
We had an agreement
to keep these depositions
private, Mr. MacMillan.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.051
Please,
finish that thought.

26:59.085 --> 27:03.022
Because he's a selfish,
self-loathing, self-serving
piece of shit.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.062
I'm prepared to offer
you 50% of my stake
in the company.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.998
Aaron:
Mr. MacMillan,
this is completely--

27:12.031 --> 27:14.266
Joe:
It's an even split.
I've got one condition.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.435
I want you to come
run it with me.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.270
Mr. MacMillan,
I'd really prefer that you
run something like this--

27:18.304 --> 27:20.039
Aaron, it's fine.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.646
60%.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.822
70%.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.924
Come be my partner

27:37.957 --> 27:40.827
and 70% of the company
is yours.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.232
Mr. Clark, my professional
advice would be to seriously
consider--

27:46.265 --> 27:49.101
I'd like to state
for the record that this
is not a legitimate offer.

27:49.135 --> 27:52.071
It's fully legitimate.
I'll sign anything you put
in front of me.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.742
Just say the word, Gordon.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.014
I don't want to work
with you, Joe.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.096
I think we now know what
this lawsuit is really about.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.816
Aaron:
Returning to the date
of July 30, 1985,

28:36.849 --> 28:39.251
Mr. Clark, from your
perspective,

28:39.285 --> 28:43.122
did Joe MacMillan
come to your residence

28:43.155 --> 28:46.525
at 2824 DePue Drive

28:46.558 --> 28:50.429
as a business partner
or a friend?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.434
I have no idea.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.139
Joanie:
What are we looking
for anyway?

29:00.172 --> 29:02.308
A mistake.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.243
My parents are up
in their bedroom

29:04.276 --> 29:06.145
wrapping presents
for my birthday party.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.314
Like I don't know exactly
what they're doing.

29:11.818 --> 29:15.521
They still think
of me as little.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.289
Well, it's 'cause
they've never seen you

29:17.323 --> 29:19.458
throw back a whiskey
and smoke a cigar
like I have.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.060
I never did that!

29:21.093 --> 29:23.029
( chuckles )

29:23.062 --> 29:26.332
You're joking.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.268
I wish I didn't have
to have a birthday party.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.870
I don't believe
in birthday parties.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.371
You can do that?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.240
Yeah, it's your birthday.
You can do whatever you want.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.408
( sighs )

29:43.449 --> 29:46.118
Did you find the mistake?

29:46.152 --> 29:47.553
No.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.361
So who's coming
to this stupid party

29:55.394 --> 29:58.230
your parents are making you
throw that you don't really
want to have anyway?

30:04.570 --> 30:08.340
Okay, let's take it
outside, okay?

30:08.374 --> 30:11.510
All right,
everybody, let's move it
on out to the backyard.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.580
Slip'N Slide is out there.
Let's go, let's go.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.482
Everybody out.
Move it.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.218
Get out of here.
Go. Go.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.987
( doorbell rings )

30:21.020 --> 30:25.257
Joanie, you've got
another guest to greet.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.159
Joanie!

30:27.193 --> 30:29.862
Oh, thank goodness.
( laughs )

30:29.896 --> 30:31.864
Come on in.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.400
Jennifer knew the name
of the street, but not
the address.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.003
So we parked, prayed,
and followed the screams.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.205
Donna:
I wasn't expecting you.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.573
Diane: Joanie invited
Jennifer and seeing as how
I am her chauffeur,

30:41.607 --> 30:44.410
we're part
of a package deal.
Where should I put this?

30:44.443 --> 30:47.046
You know what?
The girls and the gift
table are all out back.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.653
I cannot believe
she's here.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.089
I guess Joanie patched
things up with Jennifer.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.592
God, I'm telling you,
girls at this age,
it's crazy.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.094
One day
they're mortal enemies,

31:02.128 --> 31:03.295
the next day
they're best friends.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.466
What?

31:07.499 --> 31:09.301
Well, I mean,
she's here.

31:09.335 --> 31:13.272
Should we take
advantage of it?

31:13.305 --> 31:16.008
No, I don't want to face
that humiliation again.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.977
"I Need That Record" playing

31:18.010 --> 31:20.479
Daddy, Daddy!
Watch me!

31:27.353 --> 31:30.489
Hey, Ryan,
you made it.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.259
Yeah.
I can't stay long.

31:33.292 --> 31:37.063
- Not that it's not
a nice party.
- Thanks.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.966
I wouldn't know; I've never
been to a 10-year-old's
birthday party.

31:39.999 --> 31:43.235
Well, not since
I was 10.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.437
What do grown-ups do
at these things?

31:45.471 --> 31:47.406
Oh, well, drink.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.541
Hey, so--

31:51.510 --> 31:55.181
so listen,
we're not supposed
to be talking shop today,

31:55.214 --> 31:58.517
but I had a few ideas
on how to move your
chat idea forward.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.186
Oh, yeah?
Really? How?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.454
Yeah, well,
all right, listen.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.391
A few years back,
CompuServe had this
CB Simulator

32:05.424 --> 32:07.159
that I was totally
obsessed with.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.361
We could start with that
as a rudimentary template.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.430
My idea
is way more advanced
than CompuServe.

32:11.463 --> 32:15.034
I know, I know.
All we would take
from CompuServe is--

32:15.067 --> 32:18.670
is the shared memory
virtual array manager
from the CBSIM code.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.107
We make it bigger
so we can support more users

32:21.140 --> 32:23.209
and the rest
we build from scratch.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.612
That would be
a time-saver.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.647
Yeah, totally.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.650
Come here.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.987
No one designs
in a vacuum.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.989
What's the point
in reinventing the wheel

32:37.023 --> 32:39.425
if your true innovation
is creating the tire?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.692
Yeah.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.262
Take the Giant, okay?

32:43.295 --> 32:46.665
Say what you will about it,
but I started with a IBM PC

32:46.698 --> 32:49.301
and made something
that was twice as fast
at half the cost

32:49.335 --> 32:51.237
and portable
at 15 pounds.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.739
I thought
that was Joe MacMillan.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.008
( coughs )

32:56.042 --> 32:59.045
Joe MacMillan
might have pulled
the specs out of his ass,

32:59.078 --> 33:01.013
but turning them
into a working product?

33:01.047 --> 33:03.182
No, not really
his bag of tricks.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.084
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.386
Howdy, Ryan.
Look at this.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.421
- What you got there?
- Got it for Joanie.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.124
- Robo Butler.
- That looks ridiculous.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.226
Yeah, well, it ain't
your birthday, is it?

33:14.260 --> 33:17.596
- What's it do exactly?
- Here, look at this.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.066
( laughs )

33:20.099 --> 33:21.733
Lookit here.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.669
Come here,
let me show you.
Come on.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.739
Look, all right, here.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.542
Get your beers right there
into the metal paws. Come on.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.812
If you got to put the beers
in his hands, why don't you
just take them with you?

33:33.845 --> 33:36.748
I mean, what's the point
of having the robot
bring them to you?

33:36.782 --> 33:39.351
'Cause he's a butler, man.
It's what he does.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.620
- All right.
- Now back up.
Back up. Watch.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.555
Joanie gonna love this.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.459
Hey!
( laughs )

33:47.493 --> 33:49.728
Look at him.
Come on there, butler.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.531
Look at me,
I'm Robo Butler.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.067
Would you gentlemen
care for more beers?

33:55.101 --> 33:57.669
Bos, it's so slow.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.605
I mean, look, it's taking
forever to get here.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.473
I could've walked
over here faster.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.243
- ( laughs )
- I got the receipt.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.712
Don't give that
to Joanie, all right.
You're only gonna upset her.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.347
She gonna love it.

34:21.127 --> 34:24.196
Hey, nice to see Joanie
and Jennifer getting along.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.800
Just so you know,
I get 60 proposals a week.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.636
Most weeks
I pass on all 60.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.371
It really had nothing
to do with you.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.640
No, I completely
understand.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.312
It was a really
quick no you gave us
in there, though.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.651
All right, let's talk,
but not out here.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.819
Are you laughing
at my butler, children?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.721
Get out of here.
Scram, all of you.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.124
- ( girls laughing )
- Get out of here.
Dang butler.

34:52.158 --> 34:55.127
Oh, hell.
Oh, for Christ's sake.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.463
I've been combing
over our prospectus,
replaying our meeting,

34:57.496 --> 34:59.665
trying to figure out why
Elias's note derailed things.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.168
I've narrowed it down
to three possibilities.

35:02.201 --> 35:05.371
A: Elias doesn't believe
our user base will embrace

35:05.404 --> 35:08.874
Mutiny Exchange as rapidly
as our projections,
which is wrong.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.644
B: Elias thinks
our timeframe from
development to beta

35:12.678 --> 35:15.714
is overly optimistic,
which is also wrong.

35:15.747 --> 35:20.586
C: Elias is a sexist jerk
who doesn't believe two women
can run a company, which--

35:20.619 --> 35:22.654
- Okay.
- I'm leaning towards C.

35:22.688 --> 35:26.825
Elias is a sexist jerk,
but better than most.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.895
He doesn't care who runs
a company as long as it
makes him money.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.864
Okay, then I'm at a loss
because you're a smart woman

35:32.898 --> 35:34.666
and Exchange
is a great idea.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.203
I am smart
and it is a great idea.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.772
And that's your problem.
You didn't allow for D.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.841
Another company
is already doing this.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.876
What? Who?

35:44.910 --> 35:48.447
It's a small outfit
Elias has been tracking
as a potential investment.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.715
SwapMeet.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.784
It's a good name.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.354
I wasn't aware of it.
Otherwise I never would
have had you come in.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.722
What do you know
about them?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.590
Only that they have
an 18-month head start.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.692
( groans )

36:00.726 --> 36:03.795
And at the end of the day,
that's what informed
our decision.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.198
It made no sense
to bet on Mutiny

36:06.232 --> 36:07.966
in a battle
you weren't just losing,

36:07.999 --> 36:09.768
but didn't even know
you were fighting.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.939
( girls laughing,
chatting )

36:13.972 --> 36:15.874
Jennifer:
Hey, wait, guys,
do you want to come play?

36:15.907 --> 36:17.743
Okay, let's play a game.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.446
Hey, sweetie.
You doing okay?

36:24.283 --> 36:26.952
Oh, she's really pulling
focus, isn't she?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.357
Kind of like
it's her birthday
party and not yours.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.996
Look, honey,
I just want you to know
how proud I am of you

36:38.029 --> 36:39.831
for inviting Jennifer.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.667
It shows real maturity.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.770
- Okay.
- A birthday's
not just a party.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.005
It's marking a passage
of time in your life.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.241
You're showing me you're not
just a little girl anymore--

36:49.275 --> 36:52.278
Okay, I heard you.
Growing up and you're
proud of me.

36:52.311 --> 36:55.281
- Can we just
do the cake now?
- No, no. Come here.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.317
I want to make sure
you hear what I'm saying.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.986
Okay, you did a really
grown-up thing today

37:01.019 --> 37:04.523
and your dad, he couldn't
be more proud of you than
he is right now.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.825
Stop saying that.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.728
Cameron paid me 20 bucks
to invite Jennifer to come.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.264
Okay?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.765
I hate Jennifer.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.368
Can we just do
the cake now, please?

37:16.402 --> 37:18.737
- Everyone's asking for it.
- Yeah, sure.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.406
Let's do the cake.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.014
Okay, I've been on Mutiny
asking around,

37:29.047 --> 37:31.383
trying to figure out
what I could about
this SwapMeet.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.352
- And?
- From what I can tell,

37:33.385 --> 37:35.854
it sounds seriously
less robust than what we
have in mind for Exchange.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.657
Plus, it's focused
on sports memorabilia,

37:38.690 --> 37:40.759
so I just can't see it
reaching anywhere

37:40.792 --> 37:42.894
near the size and scope
of our user base.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.831
Hey, sure was weird
that Jennifer came to
the party, wasn't it?

37:45.864 --> 37:48.600
Yeah. We will not lose
to an inferior product.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.903
- I refuse to be Betamax.
- 'Cause I don't remember
inviting her.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.073
Oh, no, we didn't.
Joanie did that all
on her own.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.809
- Wasn't that mature of her?
- Yeah, it was.

37:57.843 --> 38:01.313
It shows a hell of a lot
of maturity that she
would invite Jennifer.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.014
Which, you know,
reminds me.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.554
What?
What is this for?

38:08.587 --> 38:10.556
For all your help today.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.827
Okay.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.496
Thanks.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.500
Uh, I'll be in my room.

38:23.068 --> 38:25.571
She went out
and grabbed some cups
for us at the party.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.719
( phone rings )

38:40.752 --> 38:42.854
Ryan Ray.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.523
Joe:
Ryan.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.693
Mr. MacMillan.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.429
Ryan, I want you to do
something for me.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.733
Um, okay.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.568
What?

38:56.602 --> 38:58.537
I want you to stand up.

39:00.706 --> 39:04.876
I want you to take
a long look around.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.945
I want you
to make sure you see

39:06.978 --> 39:09.715
every single person
in that room.

39:09.748 --> 39:12.017
- Are you doing that?
- Uh, yeah.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.520
Good.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.922
Now forget them,

39:16.955 --> 39:19.558
because you don't work
with those people anymore.

39:21.627 --> 39:25.564
I'll see you tomorrow
at my office, 9:00 A.M. sharp.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.500
Oh, my God.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.773
I'll be there.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.908
Thank you.

39:36.942 --> 39:40.712
Now, Ryan,
there's one more thing
I want you to do for me.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.080
( elevator bell dings )

39:42.113 --> 39:44.149
- Incredible.
- Look.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.552
It's her.
Turn around.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.055
Isn't this a bit
formal for us?

39:50.088 --> 39:52.491
We could just meet
at Jennifer's birthday
party next month.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.893
Oh, no, we'll just
be a minute.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.463
I admire persistence,
I really do,

39:57.496 --> 39:59.030
but we've been over this.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.932
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't convince

40:00.966 --> 40:02.534
my partners to fund
your expansion.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.570
- I'm sorry.
- No, we understand.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.472
- That's not why we're here.
- No, because you're right.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.574
SwapMeet is our competition.
It'd be foolish for you
to invest

40:08.607 --> 40:10.809
over a million dollars just
to see if we can catch up.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.444
And that's why
we've done our homework.

40:12.478 --> 40:15.046
And what we found
is that while SwapMeet
does have

40:15.080 --> 40:19.117
a functional program
that it would take us a year
or more to compete with,

40:19.150 --> 40:23.855
what they don't have
is anywhere near the size
of our user base.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.692
We don't want you to help us
compete with SwapMeet.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.494
We want you
to help us buy them.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.497
It's not a million
to fight a war,

40:31.530 --> 40:33.599
it's a few hundred
thousand to win it.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.743
( laughs )
Yes!

40:44.776 --> 40:46.812
Yes!

40:46.845 --> 40:49.515
Oh, my God, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.117
( stall door closes,
locks )

41:01.226 --> 41:05.163
Hey, Ryan.
Great news.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.566
I tracked down
that CBSIM code,

41:07.599 --> 41:09.835
so we can get
started today.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.070
You know, just--
just you and me.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.205
( sighs )

41:14.239 --> 41:16.808
I'm going to work
for Joe MacMillan.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.312
( music playing )
