00:00.399 --> 00:02.399
<i>Previously on...</i>
Beauty & the Beast.

00:02.400 --> 00:03.484
Are you a doctor?

00:03.548 --> 00:04.948
I'm the EMT who brought you in.

00:04.983 --> 00:06.349
Kyle.
Nice to meet you.

00:06.384 --> 00:07.717
I'm Heather.
I know.

00:07.753 --> 00:09.018
I brought you in.

00:09.054 --> 00:11.054
Oh. (laughs)
(laughs)

00:11.089 --> 00:13.923
I don't know anything about beasts.
Seeing as

00:13.959 --> 00:16.592
someone's willing to pay
$5 million to capture one...

00:16.628 --> 00:18.461
There's a bounty?

00:18.496 --> 00:21.561
One mystery buyer puts out a bounty.
Yeah, but he was close.

00:21.562 --> 00:22.744
He has no idea it's me.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.812
There's got to be
some way to stop it.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.614 --> 00:40.215
Damn it.
(phone ringing)

00:40.251 --> 00:43.085
I still got time.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.719
But you're running out of it.

00:44.755 --> 00:46.555
You know what's at stake
if you can't find JT.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.824
Don't worry.
I will find him, okay?

00:48.859 --> 00:51.126
(panting)

00:51.162 --> 00:53.461
Come on, Vincent. Focus.

00:53.497 --> 00:55.463
Relax. You can do this.

00:55.499 --> 00:57.899
(sighs)
Focus.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.168
JT:
<i>Vincent?</i>

01:06.910 --> 01:08.476
(tires screeching)

01:08.512 --> 01:11.179
Got you.

01:15.351 --> 01:18.853
(yelling, blows landing)

01:18.888 --> 01:21.689
(grunts)
(yelling, blows landing)

01:21.724 --> 01:23.657
(sighs)
Took you long enough.

01:23.693 --> 01:25.059
(yelling on game)
What do you mean?

01:25.094 --> 01:27.227
Come on, man.
I found you, didn't I?

01:27.262 --> 01:29.630
20 minutes, city of eight million people.
(yelling, blows landing on game)

01:29.665 --> 01:30.675
I think that's pretty good.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.501
Ah. Still need to get
back to the hospital before

01:32.501 --> 01:35.068
your break's over. Otherwise,
you haven't proven a thing.

01:35.103 --> 01:39.473
Wait. What...? I still need
advice on what to tell Tess.

01:39.508 --> 01:41.241
Hello! About my
turning down tenure.

01:41.276 --> 01:43.543
She's gonna freak.
How do I tell her

01:43.578 --> 01:45.545
without her thinking I don't
want to move in with her?

01:45.580 --> 01:48.849
Uh... honesty is
the best policy.

01:49.852 --> 01:52.919
Really?

01:52.955 --> 01:54.955
(yelling and blows landing
in game, JT sighs)

01:57.025 --> 01:59.992
Ah! See?

02:00.027 --> 02:02.395
Five minutes to spare.
Told you I can do it.

02:02.430 --> 02:03.763
Barely.
Barely?

02:03.798 --> 02:05.598
Barely is better than not.

02:07.034 --> 02:09.201
Come on, admit it.

02:09.237 --> 02:11.738
I passed your little test,
didn't I?

02:11.773 --> 02:13.205
This proves it.

02:13.241 --> 02:16.108
I can juggle my job,
our wonderful marriage

02:16.143 --> 02:20.579
and finding whoever
is after a beast, i.e., me.

02:20.614 --> 02:23.548
Tracking JT is totally
different, and you know it.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.284
This could take
weeks, months.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.953
Catherine, I can do it.
Okay, we can do it.

02:27.989 --> 02:29.454
I know our lives are completely

02:29.490 --> 02:30.789
out of control right now.
We barely have

02:30.824 --> 02:32.591
time to breathe, let alone...

02:32.626 --> 02:33.626
Pay bills?

02:34.024 --> 02:36.462
I was gonna say
"make love," but that, too.

02:36.463 --> 02:39.230
Look, the point is, we just
have to manage it all, okay?

02:39.266 --> 02:41.533
Keep our heads above water.
It-it really is no different

02:41.568 --> 02:42.809
to any other marriage.

02:42.833 --> 02:45.306
Every other marriage
doesn't have to worry about

02:45.406 --> 02:46.805
getting attacked,
being exposed.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.239
No, but they still
have to juggle

02:48.275 --> 02:50.375
all the things of life,
right? Careers,

02:50.410 --> 02:53.111
errands, bills,
all those wonderful things.

02:53.146 --> 02:57.048
Come on. If they can do it,
we can so do it.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.651
Okay.
Okay.

03:00.686 --> 03:04.222
Speaking of beast bounties,
Deputy Secretary Hill called,

03:04.257 --> 03:05.634
and he's got a lead,
so I got to go.

03:05.658 --> 03:06.658
Oh, God.

03:06.659 --> 03:07.925
What? What is going on?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.628
We still have three minutes.

03:10.663 --> 03:13.397
Three minutes? That's
not enough time.

03:13.433 --> 03:15.065
You want to bet?
(gasps)

03:15.100 --> 03:19.403
(grunts) Mmm. Mmm.

03:19.439 --> 03:21.271
No one touches that body
until I get there.

03:21.307 --> 03:22.772
I'm on my way. Okay.

03:22.808 --> 03:24.274
(sighs)

03:24.310 --> 03:26.410
(JT sighs)

03:26.445 --> 03:28.078
Oh. Hey.

03:28.113 --> 03:28.870
Hey.

03:28.894 --> 03:30.348
I thought you'd be
at work by now.

03:30.349 --> 03:31.915
Why? Hoping to avoid me?

03:31.951 --> 03:34.651
No. Why? Why would you say that?

03:34.686 --> 03:36.153
JT, I'm kidding. Relax.

03:36.188 --> 03:38.287
I actually have
to get going anyway.

03:38.323 --> 03:40.690
A Vic just turned up
that I think could be connected

03:40.725 --> 03:42.492
to that fight club ring I've
been trying to bust since, like,

03:42.527 --> 03:45.962
forever. Can you do me a favor
and find our lease agreement?

03:45.997 --> 03:46.745
Lease agreement?

03:46.769 --> 03:49.532
Yeah, I think I packed it
accidentally, and we need it

03:49.534 --> 03:50.767
before we move in
to our new place.

03:50.802 --> 03:52.669
Yeah. Uh, sure, I'll look.

03:52.704 --> 03:55.037
(liquid pouring)
Uh, listen...

03:55.073 --> 03:59.842
can we find time to,
you know, talk? You've,

03:59.877 --> 04:02.011
you know, been kind of busy
lately, and we haven't had

04:02.046 --> 04:04.680
much time to... catch up.

04:04.715 --> 04:07.116
I know. I'm sorry. There's just
been a lot going on, and

04:07.151 --> 04:08.617
especially now
with this new case.

04:08.652 --> 04:10.519
I actually think
I'm gonna put Cat on it.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.321
You know, maybe we could work it
together like the old days.

04:13.357 --> 04:15.023
Teamed up pretty well
with her last week.

04:15.058 --> 04:16.458
I know,
and she's probably right.

04:16.494 --> 04:18.360
I need to get back out
into the field, you know?

04:18.394 --> 04:20.495
Anyway, I have to go.

04:20.531 --> 04:22.731
Do you want to meet at
Il Cantuccio later for drinks?

04:22.766 --> 04:25.868
Yeah.
Okay. I'll call you.

04:25.903 --> 04:27.502
And, hey, maybe
you should call the university,

04:27.537 --> 04:29.971
see what's taking so long
to find out about tenure.

04:30.007 --> 04:33.041
Yeah. Uh, I'll do that.
Cool. Great.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.047
(sighs deeply)

04:39.082 --> 04:42.017
HILL:
<i>I'm getting nervous.</i>

04:42.230 --> 04:44.362
First, Agent Russo's
murdered, butchered.

04:45.186 --> 04:46.886
Then they hack
into our classified files,

04:46.922 --> 04:48.822
DHS is on alert. Sit.

04:48.858 --> 04:52.359
Which means everyone's
under heightened scrutiny

04:52.394 --> 04:52.944
around here, including me.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.046
But it turned out the hack had
nothing to do with Vincent.

04:55.047 --> 04:57.882
But it could have, Detective.

04:57.917 --> 05:00.117
Listen, Cat...
Is it Cath or Catherine?

05:00.152 --> 05:01.718
Either is fine.

05:01.753 --> 05:03.653
I need your help.

05:03.689 --> 05:06.123
Neither one of us can afford
any more high-profile attempts

05:06.158 --> 05:07.291
at capturing your husband.

05:07.326 --> 05:08.658
They may be after a beast,

05:08.694 --> 05:10.060
but they do not
know it's Vincent yet.

05:10.096 --> 05:11.996
But I do,
and I'm covering for him.

05:12.031 --> 05:15.032
Just like Agent Russo did,
and if it's all the same to you,

05:15.067 --> 05:16.900
I don't want
to get skinned alive, too.

05:16.935 --> 05:19.135
I'm the only other one
around here

05:19.170 --> 05:21.671
who knows the secret, which
means I'm at risk now, too.

05:21.707 --> 05:23.006
Which is why I'm giving you

05:23.041 --> 05:24.841
the full resources
of Homeland Security--

05:24.877 --> 05:26.042
to speed things up.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.143
Find out who's behind this

05:27.178 --> 05:29.412
as soon as possible.

05:29.447 --> 05:31.381
Who's this?
Eckhart Richter.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.916
German mercenary.
Fits your profile

05:33.951 --> 05:35.651
of the type somebody might hire

05:35.686 --> 05:37.987
to find a beast.
Bounty hunter, too,

05:38.023 --> 05:41.157
just like the last attacker.
He just turned up.

05:41.192 --> 05:43.259
Where?
Meatpacking district.

05:43.294 --> 05:45.228
Dead, unfortunately.

05:45.263 --> 05:47.763
You might be able to backtrack
Richter to a suspect.

05:47.798 --> 05:49.399
Uh, but I'm gonna need

05:49.434 --> 05:51.366
to get this cleared
with my captain first.

05:51.402 --> 05:54.003
No, you won't.
Sorry?

05:54.038 --> 05:57.573
Like I said, I need you to jump
on this for both our sakes.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.676
Nobody knows I'm covering
for Vincent, and nobody can.

06:00.711 --> 06:04.580
The longer this goes on,
and the messier it gets...

06:10.587 --> 06:12.554
It's all taken care of.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.790
You don't work
at NYPD anymore.

06:15.825 --> 06:17.959
You work for me now.

06:20.564 --> 06:22.464
(siren wailing)

06:25.435 --> 06:27.468
Keller?

06:28.404 --> 06:30.071
Hey. How's it going?

06:30.106 --> 06:31.773
What do we got?
Oh.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.207
Don't worry.
Patel's got him.

06:33.242 --> 06:35.476
Okay.

06:35.511 --> 06:36.978
Someone will be
right with you.

06:38.347 --> 06:39.880
So, how's Heather?

06:39.915 --> 06:42.783
Uh, Nurse, admit
patient to Trauma 5,

06:42.818 --> 06:44.755
put him on anti-coags and
get him to Imaging, okay?

06:44.756 --> 06:46.569
Do you know if she got the bouquet
of flowers I sent?

06:46.593 --> 06:47.788
Which one? You sent four.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.823
Too much, right?
Ah.

06:49.858 --> 06:50.896
Think I'm trying too hard?

06:50.919 --> 06:52.025
Look, Kyle, I'm
on a double shift.

06:52.027 --> 06:53.894
I'm juggling a
lot here, okay?

06:53.929 --> 06:55.296
So, if you wouldn't mind.
I like her. I do.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.730
I think she likes me, too,

06:56.765 --> 06:58.465
but I don't get
why she's shining me on.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.001
Come on, Doc, what's
the prognosis here?

07:01.036 --> 07:03.269
Do I have a shot at your
sister-in-law, or don't I?

07:03.305 --> 07:06.840
I don't know. Okay, there's
a lot happening right now.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.408
(phone buzzing) I don't understand.
What do you mean?

07:08.443 --> 07:10.844
Inbound car accident,
multiple injuries.

07:10.879 --> 07:12.445
ETA three minutes.
(overlapping chatter)

07:14.449 --> 07:15.781
(overlapping chatter)

07:15.817 --> 07:17.917
Uh... I'm sorry.

07:17.952 --> 07:19.852
I...
I'll talk to you later.

07:19.887 --> 07:22.622
WOMAN (over P.A.): All available
medical personnel to the E.R.

07:24.025 --> 07:26.326
(siren wailing)

07:28.463 --> 07:30.162
(indistinct radio transmission)

07:34.902 --> 07:39.672
And make sure to get a picture
of his bloody knuckles, please.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.441
Tess.

07:42.476 --> 07:43.676
What are you doing here?

07:43.711 --> 07:45.277
Could be another
fight club Vic.

07:45.312 --> 07:46.978
I was just about
to call you.

07:47.014 --> 07:50.149
Body just got dumped. It
could be our best lead yet.

07:50.184 --> 07:52.717
Wait. How did you find out?
Long story.

07:52.753 --> 07:56.455
But turns out that he may be
connected to the, uh...

07:56.490 --> 07:58.723
the bounty.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.560
The... bounty? Based on what?
We haven't even ID'd him yet.

08:01.595 --> 08:04.145
Eckhart Richter, German
mercenary, bounty hunter.

08:04.168 --> 08:04.930
Bounty hunt...

08:04.931 --> 08:07.165
How the hell do
you know that?

08:07.200 --> 08:09.668
Okay, I know this case
is really important to you,

08:09.703 --> 08:12.070
so, I need you to believe me
when I say that I had

08:12.105 --> 08:14.072
nothing to do with this.

08:14.107 --> 08:16.007
Nothing to do with what?
What are you talking about?

08:16.043 --> 08:18.576
How do you know who
this guy is, and I don't?

08:25.084 --> 08:26.917
Where'd you get this?

08:26.952 --> 08:30.521
Deputy Secretary.

08:30.557 --> 08:33.157
I'm sorry, Tess,
I hate to do this,

08:33.193 --> 08:35.058
but this isn't
your case anymore.

08:35.094 --> 08:36.193
It's mine.

08:53.373 --> 08:54.044
TESS: You could've called.

08:54.045 --> 08:56.079
That's all I'm saying,
given me a little warning

08:56.113 --> 08:57.846
instead of just springing
it on me like that.

08:57.881 --> 08:59.380
Tess, I would have.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.016
I just didn't expect
to see you on the scene.

09:01.051 --> 09:02.517
What are you
talking about?

09:02.552 --> 09:03.885
You know I've been
trying to bust that ring

09:03.921 --> 09:05.353
since before
I was captain.

09:05.388 --> 09:06.887
When you and I were
partners, remember?

09:06.923 --> 09:09.290
Of course I remember.

09:09.326 --> 09:11.459
Really? You don't act like it,
especially when you try

09:11.494 --> 09:13.261
to steal my case right
from underneath me.

09:13.296 --> 09:14.729
Okay, Tess, trust me.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.264
I was just as
surprised as you were

09:16.299 --> 09:17.765
when the deputy secretary
recruited me.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.200
I had no idea
this was in the works.

09:19.236 --> 09:20.702
No, but you love
it. Admit it.

09:20.737 --> 09:21.936
Yeah, you've been
wanting to be a part

09:21.971 --> 09:23.604
of something bigger
for a while now.

09:23.639 --> 09:25.139
You and JT both.
That is not what this is about.

09:25.174 --> 09:27.574
If this Vic,
Richter, can lead us

09:27.610 --> 09:29.309
to whoever put the
bounty on Vincent,

09:29.345 --> 09:31.478
that's a good thing,
right, for all of us.

09:31.513 --> 09:33.781
It means we can all go
back to our normal lives.

09:33.816 --> 09:35.249
Yeah?
Even better.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.051
If this guy turns out
to be the same one

09:37.086 --> 09:40.254
who's behind your fight club
case, then the ring is broken.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.223
Two birds, one stone.
All right, okay.

09:43.259 --> 09:45.303
Why don't you set up shop
in my office...?

09:45.327 --> 09:46.372
I can't.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.898
This isn't a joint
investigation, Tess.

09:51.933 --> 09:53.800
Hill wants DHS to handle it.

09:53.835 --> 09:56.803
He wants me to
handle it off-site.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.838
Off-site? What does that mean?
It means he wants me

09:58.874 --> 10:01.274
to set up a satellite office so
the rest of DHS doesn't find out

10:01.309 --> 10:02.909
that he's been protecting us.

10:02.944 --> 10:05.411
Not only am I losing my case,
I'm losing my detective?

10:05.446 --> 10:07.480
For now.

10:09.851 --> 10:11.317
(sighs)
Great.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.988
That's just great.

10:16.023 --> 10:21.327
Sorry, um, but I am going
to need your files, too.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.598
VINCENT:
<i>Special Agent Chandler?</i>

10:25.633 --> 10:27.667
Hmm...

10:27.702 --> 10:29.768
Come on, I mean,
you're happy about this?

10:29.804 --> 10:32.671
I guess. Frankly,
my head's still spinning.

10:32.706 --> 10:34.173
It's probably
just temporary till we

10:34.208 --> 10:35.607
figure out
who's behind the beast bounty.

10:35.642 --> 10:36.675
It doesn't sound
<i>that</i> temporary.

10:36.710 --> 10:38.110
Otherwise,
why would Hill

10:38.145 --> 10:39.511
set you up with an office?
I don't know.

10:39.546 --> 10:41.180
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

10:41.215 --> 10:43.515
We've got enough on our plates
without having to worry about this.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.950
What? This is nothing to worry
about. I think it's great.

10:45.985 --> 10:47.885
Higher-profile cases,
more resources,

10:47.921 --> 10:50.622
more action.
More work, more juggling.

10:50.657 --> 10:52.524
More <i>money.</i>
Come on,

10:52.559 --> 10:54.225
I mean, we could afford
to hire an assistant.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.461
We sure as hell could
use one right now.

10:56.496 --> 10:58.229
Funny you should say that.

10:58.264 --> 10:59.864
Well, it's a two-career
household, okay?

10:59.899 --> 11:01.332
They're a little overwhelmed.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.007
(whispers):
Electric company. I hate them.

11:03.036 --> 11:07.205
Okay. I am sending the past-due
payment now, which should

11:07.240 --> 11:08.372
make them current.
Okay, thank you.

11:08.407 --> 11:10.308
Ciao. Okay,

11:10.343 --> 11:12.243
I picked up your dry cleaning,
used a coupon,

11:12.278 --> 11:14.879
but they accidentally sent
Vincent's lab coats

11:14.914 --> 11:16.814
to the hospital,
so I will pick those up

11:16.850 --> 11:19.216
when I drop off
your rent checks.

11:19.251 --> 11:21.585
Whew! Married life
is complicated.

11:21.620 --> 11:25.255
Meet our new assistant.
Okay.

11:25.290 --> 11:28.934
Uh, a-are you sure you can
handle all this, Heather?

11:28.958 --> 11:30.862
I mean, it's-it's a lot.

11:30.863 --> 11:32.730
Oh, please, did I not plan,
like, three weddings last year?

11:32.765 --> 11:34.898
Besides, I really need
the job, remember?

11:34.933 --> 11:36.900
(exhales): Okay, I am off
to the hospital.

11:36.935 --> 11:38.534
To pick up lab coats

11:38.570 --> 11:40.036
or to see Kyle?

11:40.072 --> 11:42.538
Kyle? Kyle who?

11:42.574 --> 11:44.674
Uh, don't worry,
I know I can't risk

11:44.709 --> 11:46.409
starting a new relationship
right now

11:46.444 --> 11:49.112
with somebody after you. <i>Again.</i>

11:49.147 --> 11:50.213
Celibacy sucks.

11:50.882 --> 11:52.081
Agreed.

11:52.116 --> 11:54.751
Well, then the sooner
we find Pierre Medjani,

11:54.786 --> 11:56.386
the better.
Who?

11:56.421 --> 11:58.921
Someone I found
on the DHS watch list

11:58.956 --> 12:01.724
that Hill gave me, and somebody
I think is after you.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.426
Why?
Because...

12:03.461 --> 12:05.595
he is an arms dealer, and you
are the ultimate weapon--

12:05.630 --> 12:06.763
a living, breathing

12:06.798 --> 12:08.230
super soldier, right?

12:08.266 --> 12:10.065
Plus, apparently,

12:10.101 --> 12:12.234
Medjani is into blood sports--

12:12.270 --> 12:13.602
these underground
fight club rings where

12:13.637 --> 12:14.703
sometimes people fight

12:14.738 --> 12:16.071
to the death.
Oh, nice.

12:16.107 --> 12:17.306
Who's this guy?

12:17.341 --> 12:18.573
Eckhart Richter.

12:18.609 --> 12:19.975
According to the M.E.,

12:20.011 --> 12:22.044
he's the latest victim
of those rings,

12:22.079 --> 12:23.578
and a known associate
of Medjani.

12:23.614 --> 12:25.380
So you think Medjani
was gonna send

12:25.416 --> 12:27.081
this guy out to get me?
Possibly.

12:27.117 --> 12:28.417
Could be that he wanted

12:28.452 --> 12:30.084
to see if Richter
could handle you

12:30.120 --> 12:31.720
by testing him out
in the ring first.

12:31.755 --> 12:33.121
Makes sense that
Medjani would want

12:33.156 --> 12:34.989
to audition somebody
after the last attempt.

12:35.025 --> 12:37.759
Okay, so find the fight club,
find Medjani.

12:37.795 --> 12:39.494
It's worth a try.
The problem is,

12:39.530 --> 12:41.595
trying to find
a place to look.

12:41.631 --> 12:44.498
The fights, they're
super exclusive-- invite-only.

12:44.534 --> 12:47.468
Maybe I could backtrack this guy
where he's dumped in the alley,

12:47.503 --> 12:50.004
but the problem is,
how do we find our way in?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.973
Well, this may help.

12:52.008 --> 12:53.741
I'm assuming that this

12:53.776 --> 12:55.276
is how Richter got in.

12:55.312 --> 12:57.144
He was a fighter, right?

12:58.280 --> 13:01.081
No. What, you want me to fight?

13:01.116 --> 13:03.951
Relax. Only
if necessary.

13:03.986 --> 13:05.419
Come on, it's not
like you have

13:05.455 --> 13:07.020
to worry about losing--
they're not beasts.

13:07.056 --> 13:08.689
Oh, yeah, tell that to that guy.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.791
Besides, I already changed
my shift at the hospital once today.

13:10.827 --> 13:13.193
I can't do it again. I got
to get back as soon as possible.

13:13.228 --> 13:15.095
I know, I know.
You're squeezed-- we both are--

13:15.130 --> 13:16.830
but if we don't catch
whoever's after you,

13:16.865 --> 13:19.833
then we have a lot more to worry
about than just our jobs.

13:24.073 --> 13:26.639
Hey there! How's it going?
Hey.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.141
Sorry I'm late.

13:29.345 --> 13:31.344
What's wrong?

13:31.379 --> 13:34.814
(sighs) I just wish I didn't have
to find out this way, you know?

13:34.850 --> 13:38.351
Find out about
what, exactly?

13:38.386 --> 13:39.953
About Cat.
Didn't you hear?

13:39.988 --> 13:41.788
Cat? Uh, no. Hear what?

13:41.823 --> 13:43.222
I-I just talked to her.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.291
She wanted me to...
pick up some files,

13:45.326 --> 13:46.859
do some research
on a case

13:46.894 --> 13:48.827
she's working on.
My c... that was my case.

13:48.863 --> 13:50.162
Now it's her case.

13:50.198 --> 13:52.164
What are you talking about?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.200
Cat works for DHS now.

13:54.235 --> 13:55.567
She's a special agent.
Wait.

13:55.603 --> 13:57.236
What? Just like that?

13:57.271 --> 13:58.371
Just like that.

13:58.406 --> 14:00.572
I mean,
I'm happy for her.

14:00.608 --> 14:03.842
I am. It's just...
a shock, you know?

14:03.878 --> 14:06.144
Not only am I losing
my best detective, she's...

14:06.179 --> 14:07.880
she's my friend.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.347
(sighs) I just wish

14:09.383 --> 14:12.985
she'd broken the news
to me earlier, you know?

14:13.020 --> 14:17.022
Maybe she wanted to, but d...
didn't know how you'd react.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.290
That's no excuse, that's never an excuse,
you know that.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.828
Uh, look, there's something
I need to tell you.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.563
It's fine, JT.
I'll be fine.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.500
Life goes on, you know?
I have to get back to work.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.403
I have to reassign all
of Cat's open cases tonight,

14:31.438 --> 14:32.570
so don't wait up.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.771
Uh...

14:33.806 --> 14:36.206
okay, but, um...

14:36.242 --> 14:38.242

Kyle! Hi.

14:55.627 --> 14:58.295
You're a tough girl to get ahold of.
I know. I've been super busy.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.231
I'm sorry. But thank you
for the flowers.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.366
I got to go.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.967
Wait. Heather...

15:04.002 --> 15:05.135
hold up.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.770
Are you avoiding me
for some reason?

15:06.805 --> 15:09.372
Me? No. Why?

15:09.407 --> 15:11.107
Why? Are you kidding?

15:11.142 --> 15:14.277
I've texted, sent flowers,
cornered your brother-in-law...

15:14.312 --> 15:16.746
who, by the way, I don't think
likes me very much.

15:16.782 --> 15:19.115
Oh, please.
Who couldn't like you?

15:20.619 --> 15:22.318
I mean...

15:22.353 --> 15:24.554
That came out wrong.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.921
Come on, what's the big secret?

15:27.459 --> 15:28.657
You can tell me.

15:30.295 --> 15:32.962
Actually, I can't.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.932
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

15:43.373 --> 15:45.674
CATHERINE: Are you sure
this is the right place?

15:45.710 --> 15:47.509
VINCENT:
Well, from what I can tell,

15:47.544 --> 15:49.778
Medjani's man was dragged
through this alleyway

15:49.814 --> 15:52.014
and thrown into
a waiting car.

15:52.049 --> 15:55.350
So if there's a fight club, it's got
to be around here somewhere.

15:55.385 --> 15:56.852
Are you okay
with doing this?

15:56.887 --> 15:59.020
Ha! <i>Now</i> you're asking.

18:42.096 --> 18:44.029
I've got you
in my corner.

18:44.065 --> 18:48.000
Remember? They're the ones
who should be worried. (sighs)

18:48.035 --> 18:49.502
(grunting)

18:50.705 --> 18:52.672
(crowd cheering)

18:52.707 --> 18:55.207
Maybe I'm a little worried.

18:55.242 --> 18:56.508
(sighs)

18:58.879 --> 19:00.846
(horn honking)

19:00.881 --> 19:03.048
WOMAN (on phone): Mm-hmm.
No, I don't want to fight with you.

19:03.084 --> 19:05.050
I'm just saying I sent it in.

19:05.086 --> 19:08.020
Are you sure...?
Yes! I hit "send."

19:08.055 --> 19:09.321
It said "payment received."

19:09.356 --> 19:11.523
I moved on with my life,
such as it is.

19:11.558 --> 19:14.659
Can you hold on...?
No! No, no, no. Do not transfer me.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.993
God.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.363
(frustrated grunt)
Unbelievable!

19:18.398 --> 19:20.398
(groans):
Oh...!

19:21.535 --> 19:23.067
Is Cat here?

19:23.103 --> 19:25.069
Does it look
like Cat is here?

19:25.105 --> 19:27.105
Gosh, JT, I
changed my mind.

19:27.140 --> 19:29.006
I never want
to get married.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.508
Not like it's ever gonna happen
to me at this rate anyway.

19:31.544 --> 19:32.544
God.

19:32.578 --> 19:35.213
(frustrated yell)

19:36.449 --> 19:38.750
So she wanted me
to pick up some files...

19:40.553 --> 19:41.953
Thanks.

19:41.988 --> 19:42.988
(ringtone plays)
(sighs)

19:45.057 --> 19:47.391
Kyle.

19:47.426 --> 19:49.693
(big sigh) So,

19:49.729 --> 19:52.095
when's the happy day?
Sorry?

19:52.131 --> 19:54.531
You and Tess-- you guys are
moving in together, right?

19:54.567 --> 19:56.267
Please tell me somebody's
getting laid around here.

19:56.302 --> 19:58.235
Did I just say that?

19:58.271 --> 20:00.237
I... got to go.

20:00.272 --> 20:01.304
Wait.

20:01.339 --> 20:02.405
Hold it.

20:03.175 --> 20:04.440
Did something happen?

20:04.476 --> 20:05.541
Did she dump you?

20:05.577 --> 20:06.977
No, she didn't dump me.

20:07.012 --> 20:08.278
At least not yet.

20:09.148 --> 20:10.747
I haven't had a chance

20:10.783 --> 20:12.582
to tell her
I turned down tenure yet.

20:12.617 --> 20:14.584
So...
Really?

20:14.619 --> 20:16.319
You turned it down?

20:16.354 --> 20:17.720
Why?

20:17.756 --> 20:19.722
Because being a professor
for the rest

20:19.758 --> 20:21.724
of my life isn't what
I want to do anymore.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.293
That's why.
I mean,

20:23.328 --> 20:25.595
I-I thought it was, but...

20:25.630 --> 20:27.330
So you're unemployed now.
Yeah.

20:27.365 --> 20:29.231
Which means you can't afford
your half of the new rent.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.167
No.
And Tess doesn't know about it.

20:31.202 --> 20:32.468
Right.

20:32.504 --> 20:33.669
She's gonna kill you.

20:33.704 --> 20:35.504
I know!

20:39.043 --> 20:40.609
(bell clangs)
(groans)

20:40.644 --> 20:42.011
CATHERINE:
In fairness, I didn't realize

20:42.046 --> 20:43.779
this was gonna be
a four-way brawl

20:43.815 --> 20:46.348
when I agreed to do this.
We can still get out of this,

20:46.383 --> 20:47.333
and I can still keep my job.

20:47.357 --> 20:49.238
Yeah, and we lose our chance
at finding Medjani.

20:49.553 --> 20:51.119
We're here, Vincent,
let's do it.

20:51.154 --> 20:53.021
Any tips?
Yes.

20:53.056 --> 20:54.889
Go for the kickboxer first,
okay? That's your specialty.

20:54.925 --> 20:57.626
Let the other two brawl it out,
but you go for her left knee.

20:57.661 --> 21:00.829
It's got a surgical scar on it.
That's her Achilles' heel.

21:00.864 --> 21:03.031
Every fighter's got one, okay?
Wow,

21:03.066 --> 21:04.333
good tip.
(bell dings)

21:04.368 --> 21:06.600
Anything else?
Yeah. Don't let them hit

21:06.636 --> 21:07.869
that pretty face of yours.

21:07.904 --> 21:09.537
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.172
(bell dings)

21:18.681 --> 21:20.014
Get up, honey!
Up, up, up.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.682
Come on.

21:26.055 --> 21:28.055
Go for the knee!
Go for the knee!

21:29.425 --> 21:30.691
That's it, baby, that's it.

21:30.727 --> 21:32.192
Aah!

21:32.228 --> 21:34.161
Yeah!

21:34.864 --> 21:36.330
Sorry.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.199
Hey.

21:42.704 --> 21:44.905
(bell dings)

21:50.846 --> 21:53.513
Vincent.

21:53.548 --> 21:56.349
Okay, yeah, she needs
to get to a hospital.

21:56.385 --> 21:59.385
No, no... no hospital.
He'll find out.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.087
Come with me. You won.
What?

22:01.122 --> 22:02.922
Into the van.
Final round.

22:02.957 --> 22:05.057
You're going to see Medjani.
Hey, no, no, no!

22:05.093 --> 22:06.492
No, she doesn't
go anywhere without me.

22:06.527 --> 22:07.659
Hey, no trainers.
Fighters only.

22:07.695 --> 22:09.161
Vincent, it's okay, I'm fine.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.930
You'll find me, you always do.

22:10.965 --> 22:12.865
She needs you more right now.

22:26.243 --> 22:28.243
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:35.752 --> 22:37.553
Hey, what's going on?

22:37.588 --> 22:39.988
Where am I?
It's okay, you're at the hospital.

22:40.023 --> 22:41.390
You'll be absolutely fine.

22:41.425 --> 22:44.192
And you-- you're a doctor?

22:44.227 --> 22:46.494
Yes, I'm a doctor.

22:46.529 --> 22:49.631
I'm gonna check
your eyes.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.399
Dr. Keller?
What's going on?

22:51.434 --> 22:53.001
Someone said
you brought a patient in.

22:53.036 --> 22:55.670
Yes, I did.

22:55.706 --> 22:58.372
Uh, she's been beat up
and I found her.

22:58.408 --> 23:00.708
Found her?
Where? How?

23:00.743 --> 23:02.510
Look, could you please
do me a huge favor--

23:02.545 --> 23:04.178
go get me 20 milligrams
of morphine.

23:04.214 --> 23:05.546
Okay?
It's fine. I will

23:05.582 --> 23:06.914
explain later.
Please.

23:06.949 --> 23:08.282
Okay.

23:10.253 --> 23:11.586
I'm sorry
about that.

23:11.621 --> 23:14.222
Okay.

23:14.257 --> 23:15.889
Up you go.
Yeah, easy.

23:15.925 --> 23:18.525
Easy. I got to get
you stabilized

23:18.560 --> 23:21.095
so I can go back out
and find my wife.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.596
Your wife?

23:22.632 --> 23:24.331
Um, I can't be here.

23:24.366 --> 23:26.366
I got to fight.
Listen, you.

23:26.401 --> 23:28.769
You're not doing any more
fighting for today, okay?

23:28.804 --> 23:30.838
Just relax.
You're lucky to be alive.

23:30.873 --> 23:32.606
You think Medjani gives a damn?

23:33.708 --> 23:35.074
All he cares about is winning.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.343
You know him?

23:36.378 --> 23:37.910
You know Medjani?

23:37.946 --> 23:39.246
Yeah, unfortunately.

23:39.281 --> 23:40.913
How do you know him?

23:42.251 --> 23:44.751
He gave me my first big break

23:44.786 --> 23:47.454
as a fighter and he helped
get my family out of debt.

23:47.489 --> 23:50.056
But I didn't realize that

23:50.091 --> 23:52.558
that meant he owns me.
But he does.

23:52.593 --> 23:55.962
And he always expects me to win.

23:55.997 --> 23:59.431
Because... he always bets on me.

24:00.434 --> 24:01.934
He doesn't like to lose.

24:01.970 --> 24:04.070
What happens if you don't win?

24:04.105 --> 24:06.272
I'm dead.

24:06.307 --> 24:10.242
Like I said,
he doesn't like to lose.

24:10.278 --> 24:12.578
He won't let your wife lose.

24:12.613 --> 24:14.613
And once he has her...

24:14.649 --> 24:15.747
Listen to me.
You help me find Medjani--

24:15.783 --> 24:17.783
you help me
find my wife--

24:17.818 --> 24:20.386
and I promise you,
you will never have to worry

24:20.421 --> 24:22.420
about that guy again.

24:25.793 --> 24:29.394
First round takes place at some
club that Medjani frequents.

24:29.429 --> 24:30.896
Upper East Side somewhere.

24:30.931 --> 24:33.165
I-I don't know, JT,
maybe, uh, check

24:33.200 --> 24:35.466
Catherine's DHS files, okay? See
if anything pops up, all right?

24:35.502 --> 24:37.135
And keep trying
to track down that van

24:37.171 --> 24:39.051
that took her, too, okay?
I'm gonna do the same.

24:43.376 --> 24:44.842
(knocking)

24:46.813 --> 24:48.779
Hey.
Hey. Where you been?

24:48.815 --> 24:50.948
Oh, I, uh,
decided to stay

24:50.983 --> 24:53.318
at my place last night.
Yeah, I figured.

24:53.353 --> 24:56.020
Yeah, I did have a,
uh, nice, long chat

24:56.055 --> 24:57.654
with our
future landlord, though.

24:57.690 --> 25:00.357
Right. Listen, uh, could
we talk about that later?

25:00.392 --> 25:03.127
I'm trying to track this van.
So you turned down your tenure, huh?

25:06.332 --> 25:07.865
Oh, how'd I find out?
Well, it wasn't

25:07.900 --> 25:09.433
from my boyfriend,
which is, of course,

25:09.468 --> 25:10.534
how you'd expect me to find out.

25:10.569 --> 25:11.801
Tess...
No, no, no, no.

25:11.837 --> 25:13.136
I had to find out

25:13.171 --> 25:14.871
from the landlord
who called the university

25:14.906 --> 25:16.373
to verify your employment

25:16.408 --> 25:18.308
and then called me.
I wanted to tell you.

25:18.344 --> 25:20.711
I did, but I just...

25:20.746 --> 25:23.213
I didn't know how to, and I-I
knew you'd think it meant...

25:23.249 --> 25:24.701
What, that you don't want
to move in with me? It does.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.651
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

25:26.652 --> 25:29.152
Then how come you're still
packing five weeks later, huh?

25:29.187 --> 25:31.554
All right? You don't even
have that much stuff.

25:31.589 --> 25:34.057
Then you quit your job,
you change your mind

25:34.092 --> 25:35.691
about your entire life
without including me?

25:35.727 --> 25:38.862
What am I supposed to think?

25:38.897 --> 25:40.897
I... Look, I-I'm an idiot.

25:40.932 --> 25:42.331
I am. And-and

25:42.367 --> 25:43.833
you have every right
to be pissed,

25:43.869 --> 25:45.534
but honestly, right now

25:45.570 --> 25:47.570
I need to help Vincent find Cat.

25:47.605 --> 25:49.872
Find Cat?

25:49.907 --> 25:51.173
What happened?
VINCENT: JT?

25:51.208 --> 25:52.508
You find that
van yet?

25:52.543 --> 25:54.176
Uh, no.

25:54.211 --> 25:55.311
I lost it at 58th

25:55.346 --> 25:57.179
and Park. You couldn't track it?

25:57.214 --> 26:00.549
If I could, would I be here?

26:00.585 --> 26:01.850
Oh, I'm sorry, man,
that was a jerk

26:01.886 --> 26:03.718
of a thing to say. I'm
just-- I'm panicked,

26:03.754 --> 26:05.220
you know, I shouldn't
have left Catherine

26:05.256 --> 26:06.822
just to take that other
fighter to the hospital.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.590
What the hell was I thinking?
Whoa, whoa, wait--

26:08.625 --> 26:11.526
fighter? Does this have to do
with my fight club case?

26:11.561 --> 26:14.263
Yeah. Look, we may have
found a lead on whoever

26:14.298 --> 26:17.266
put up the bounty. Some-some
guy called Medjani.

26:17.301 --> 26:18.266
Pierre Medjani?

26:18.302 --> 26:19.334
You know him?

26:19.369 --> 26:20.369
Yeah.

26:21.438 --> 26:22.937
Are my files here?

26:22.972 --> 26:24.572
Yeah.

26:24.608 --> 26:26.608
Pierre Medjani
was my key suspect

26:26.643 --> 26:28.242
behind the ring, but I didn't
have enough to bust him

26:28.278 --> 26:30.445
at the time, but I was...
I was working on it. Here.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.046
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

26:32.081 --> 26:34.282
Because the case was
taken away from me, remember?

26:35.418 --> 26:37.885
This is what happens
when people stop communicating.

26:39.655 --> 26:41.689
Here, Alighieri House.

26:41.724 --> 26:43.191
This is the name
of Medjani's club.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.792
It's on 69th
between Fifth and Madison.

26:44.828 --> 26:46.760
Yeah, it looks like
a condo from the outside,

26:46.796 --> 26:48.296
but that's just a cover.
Mm!

26:48.331 --> 26:50.331
I love you!
At least somebody loves me.

26:54.637 --> 26:56.603
I love you.

26:56.639 --> 26:59.340
(groans)

27:02.311 --> 27:04.511
(indistinct chatter)

27:14.489 --> 27:15.755
MAN:
Let's go.

27:37.044 --> 27:38.811
How's it going?

27:41.849 --> 27:43.582
WOMAN: That's him,
that's Pierre Medjani.

27:43.617 --> 27:44.750
(applause)

27:44.785 --> 27:46.385
MAN:
Pierre Medjani.

27:56.330 --> 27:57.596
Good evening,

27:57.631 --> 27:59.631
Mr. Medjani.

28:01.535 --> 28:02.801
EMCEE:
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:02.836 --> 28:05.771
if I may have
your attention, please.

28:05.806 --> 28:08.373
The main event
is about to begin.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.975
Winner take all.

28:11.011 --> 28:13.077
(cheering)

28:15.015 --> 28:16.480
(grunting)

28:31.406 --> 28:32.838
(grunting)

28:47.354 --> 28:50.656
TESS:
<i>No, D-J-A-N-I. Medjani.</i>

28:50.691 --> 28:53.526
Does that mean I have it?
Oh, great, thanks.

28:53.561 --> 28:55.027
All right,
judge approved the warrant,

28:55.062 --> 28:57.095
tac team is scrambling.
ETA ten minutes.

28:57.131 --> 28:58.573
Ten minutes? What... Catherine
might not have ten minutes.

28:58.597 --> 28:59.433
Hey, turn on 61st.

28:59.434 --> 29:00.699
(chimes)

29:00.735 --> 29:02.100
That's me. Can
you check it?

29:02.937 --> 29:04.069
Is it Catherine?

29:04.104 --> 29:06.004
No, it's New York General.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.273
Apparently you missed your shift.
Ah, what else is new?

29:08.309 --> 29:09.874
I thought this would
get easier, Tess.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.843
I thought when Catherine
and I got married,

29:11.878 --> 29:14.112
you know, we'd move on to
the next chapter of our lives...

29:14.148 --> 29:16.581
Will you gun it, please?
Come on!

29:17.784 --> 29:19.216
(grunting)

29:29.295 --> 29:30.562
No.

29:30.597 --> 29:32.363
(grunts)
Enough.

29:32.398 --> 29:35.299
(crowd, whistling, cheering)

29:41.107 --> 29:42.506
Wait.

29:59.124 --> 30:00.624
NYPD!
Nobody move,

30:00.659 --> 30:02.759
you're under arrest.
Everybody freeze!

30:08.133 --> 30:10.133
MAN: Hey, everybody remain
where you are.

30:10.168 --> 30:12.135
Vincent?
He's here.

30:17.709 --> 30:19.709
Freeze. DHS.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.789
You're DHS?

30:33.825 --> 30:35.758
You set me up?

30:35.793 --> 30:38.995
Yeah. And you're under arrest
for, among other things,

30:39.030 --> 30:41.030
putting a bounty out
on my husband.

30:41.065 --> 30:42.831
Bounty? What bounty?

30:42.866 --> 30:44.699
What are you talking about?

30:44.735 --> 30:45.867
Kill her.

30:48.739 --> 30:50.472
(screams)

30:51.909 --> 30:53.008
(screams)

30:55.179 --> 30:56.378
What the hell was that?

30:56.414 --> 30:58.146
I think you know.

30:58.181 --> 31:00.415
(low growling)

31:02.886 --> 31:04.819
What the hell?

31:04.855 --> 31:06.120
What are you?

31:06.156 --> 31:07.121
What's happening?

31:07.157 --> 31:08.723
Please, please, please,

31:08.759 --> 31:10.892
don't-don't kill me,
I beg you. I'm sorry.

31:10.928 --> 31:13.861
Whatever I've done...
I don't, I don't... please,

31:13.896 --> 31:15.129
I'm sorry.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.031
Or maybe he doesn't know.

31:23.406 --> 31:25.173
(indistinct chatter)

31:37.053 --> 31:39.486
Hey, for the record,
Cat didn't need rescuing.

31:39.521 --> 31:41.254
She kicked ass.
Uh, for the record,

31:41.290 --> 31:45.325
I wasn't worried, Tess.
Mm-hmm. Still, Vincent,

31:45.360 --> 31:47.827
SWAT almost saw you,
and, worse, Medjani did.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.463
Eh, who's gonna believe him?

31:50.599 --> 31:52.765
Thank you.
You're welcome.

31:57.639 --> 31:59.606
Hey.

32:00.809 --> 32:02.209
You mind if we have
a minute?

32:02.244 --> 32:03.275
It's okay.
I'm a... I'm a doctor.

32:03.311 --> 32:05.211
And her husband.

32:05.246 --> 32:07.213
At least, I hope I still am.

32:07.248 --> 32:09.515
Okay. All yours.
Thank you.

32:09.550 --> 32:12.218
For better or worse, right?

32:19.793 --> 32:21.560
Oh, gosh.
Ow.

32:21.596 --> 32:23.629
Yeah, that is gonna need
stitches. I thought

32:23.664 --> 32:25.598
I told you not to let anyone hit
that pretty little face

32:25.633 --> 32:27.233
of yours. Oh.
I'm sorry,

32:27.268 --> 32:28.800
I was too busy trying
to stay alive.

32:28.836 --> 32:31.303
Oh, yeah, that.
Huh.

32:31.339 --> 32:33.905
Look, I'm so sorry. I tried
to get here as fast as I could.

32:33.941 --> 32:35.574
It's okay, really.

32:35.610 --> 32:37.643
I'm the one who volunteered
for this, remember?

32:37.678 --> 32:39.377
Yeah, but only 'cause you
thought by taking down Medjani

32:39.412 --> 32:41.212
that we'd get our lives back,
right?

32:41.248 --> 32:42.881
Yeah. Try again.

32:42.916 --> 32:44.282
Yeah.

32:44.317 --> 32:46.284
Eh, come on.
It's not all that bad.

32:46.319 --> 32:50.455
We took down Tess' undercover
fight club, and you got

32:50.490 --> 32:52.490
one of DHS's most wanted.

32:52.526 --> 32:55.126
That's pretty good for your first day
on the job, Special Agent.

32:55.162 --> 32:56.628
Yeah, and you saved

32:56.663 --> 32:59.096
that fighter's life.

32:59.132 --> 33:02.500
But that doesn't solve any
of <i>our</i> problems.

33:02.536 --> 33:03.434
No.

33:03.470 --> 33:04.569
(phone chimes)

33:04.604 --> 33:06.437
(clears throat)

33:06.473 --> 33:07.505
Let me guess,

33:07.541 --> 33:08.673
the hospital?

33:08.708 --> 33:11.608
Damn it. I-I really got to go.

33:11.644 --> 33:13.978
I'll send the paramedic
back in, okay?

33:14.013 --> 33:14.945
Sure. He's cute.

33:14.981 --> 33:16.113
And you're married.

33:16.149 --> 33:17.982
Ow!

33:20.619 --> 33:23.154
(chuckles softly)

33:28.957 --> 33:30.256
Come in.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.009
Hey.

33:32.045 --> 33:34.813
Since when do you knock?

33:34.849 --> 33:35.861
Since, uh...

33:35.862 --> 33:38.063
Oh, right.
Since you became a fed.

33:38.098 --> 33:40.165
Sounds really weird.
Yeah, that's 'cause

33:40.200 --> 33:41.733
feds are usually the enemy.

33:41.768 --> 33:44.368
They tend to, uh, exercise their
jurisdictional authority

33:44.404 --> 33:46.804
whenever the hell
they feel like it, remember?

33:46.839 --> 33:48.172
Bad time.

33:48.208 --> 33:48.839
No, no.

33:48.874 --> 33:49.907
Whatever.

33:49.942 --> 33:50.942
I'm not mad anymore.

33:52.011 --> 33:54.378
Doesn't mean
I like it.

33:54.414 --> 33:57.181
I was hoping we'd get
to work together on cases,

33:57.217 --> 33:58.516
you know,
like we used to.

33:58.551 --> 33:59.750
We still can,
Tess,

33:59.785 --> 34:01.218
just in a different way.

34:01.954 --> 34:03.020
Seriously.

34:03.055 --> 34:04.588
Vincent
told me

34:04.623 --> 34:06.523
that you were the one
that found me,

34:06.558 --> 34:07.591
because you were
on Medjani's trail

34:07.626 --> 34:09.726
the entire time and DHS wasn't.

34:09.762 --> 34:12.529
Imagine,
we could just share resources,

34:12.563 --> 34:14.231
work together
on a bunch of cases.

34:14.266 --> 34:15.565
It could be great.

34:25.444 --> 34:27.744
(exhales)

34:28.780 --> 34:31.715
(sniffles)

34:34.418 --> 34:37.754
You sure DHS
is really what you want?

34:37.789 --> 34:40.255
For now, yeah. You know,

34:40.291 --> 34:42.291
at least until we figure out
who's behind this beast bounty.

34:42.326 --> 34:43.292
And then...

34:43.327 --> 34:45.561
and then we'll see.

34:45.596 --> 34:47.230
I don't know.

34:47.264 --> 34:48.864
Something tells me
this is gonna stick.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.467
And I can totally see it.
(chuckles)

34:51.502 --> 34:54.803
Ten years, we've been
working together, Cat.

34:54.838 --> 34:58.039
I'm... I'm really
gonna miss you.

34:58.075 --> 35:01.243
I'm gonna miss you.
(sniffles)

35:01.279 --> 35:05.247
Well, at least you don't have
to cover for me anymore.

35:05.283 --> 35:06.348
(both chuckle)

35:12.256 --> 35:13.922
HEATHER:
<i>I'll have another, please.</i>

35:14.958 --> 35:17.325
Thank you.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.267
I'll take a glass, too, please.

35:26.303 --> 35:29.404
Kyle?What-what are you doing here?
I'm not giving up.

35:29.439 --> 35:31.238
That's what I'm doing here.

35:31.274 --> 35:33.741
Kyle, listen...
I like you, Heather.

35:33.777 --> 35:34.809
A lot.

35:34.844 --> 35:36.277
Look,
if you want

35:36.313 --> 35:37.612
to pretend
that we never slept together,

35:37.647 --> 35:38.846
that's fine.
Kyle.

35:38.881 --> 35:40.281
But we did sleep together.

35:40.316 --> 35:41.916
It was fantastic.

35:41.951 --> 35:43.684
It was the kind of
fantastic that says

35:43.719 --> 35:46.120
it was a hell of a lot more
than just a one-night stand.

35:46.155 --> 35:47.721
For both of us.

35:49.391 --> 35:50.858
So you've got family secrets.

35:50.893 --> 35:52.827
Big deal. Who doesn't?

35:52.862 --> 35:53.828
You have no idea.

35:53.863 --> 35:55.796
I don't care.

35:55.832 --> 35:58.365
I don't.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.166
And I don't care how hard
your brother-in-law tries

36:00.202 --> 36:02.101
to push me away either.

36:02.137 --> 36:04.338
'Cause I'm not giving up
unless you tell me to.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.673
Right here, right now.

36:06.709 --> 36:11.545
(sighs)
Look at me, Heather.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.546
Just tell me you don't ever want
to see me again,

36:13.581 --> 36:15.448
and I'll walk away.

36:15.483 --> 36:17.483
I promise.

36:19.354 --> 36:22.322
But if you can't do that...

36:22.357 --> 36:25.358
I'm not going anywhere.

36:29.231 --> 36:31.997
Just...

36:33.401 --> 36:36.001
...don't ask too many questions,
okay?

36:36.036 --> 36:37.336
Like what?

36:37.372 --> 36:39.137
(scoffs)

36:39.173 --> 36:41.173
I won't.

37:05.899 --> 37:07.265
What are you doing?

37:07.300 --> 37:08.900
Hi.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.902
I didn't hear you come in.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.407
You all right?

37:15.442 --> 37:17.842
(sighs)
No, I'm not all right.

37:17.878 --> 37:20.711
My best detective and partner
just quit on me,

37:20.746 --> 37:22.046
and my...

37:22.081 --> 37:23.447
boyfriend lied to me.

37:23.482 --> 37:26.217
Whoa.
I didn't exactly lie to you.

37:26.252 --> 37:28.119
No, you did, though.

37:28.154 --> 37:29.887
Every time we saw each other

37:29.923 --> 37:31.688
and you didn't tell me
you turned down tenure,

37:31.724 --> 37:34.292
that's... that's no
different than a lie.

37:34.327 --> 37:36.393
Lucky for you,

37:36.429 --> 37:38.629
I'm just too tired to be mad
right now.

37:38.664 --> 37:40.196
(chuckles)
Lucky me.

37:40.232 --> 37:42.433
Uh, don't press your luck.

37:49.174 --> 37:51.742
Hey.

37:51.777 --> 37:54.277
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.912
I... (stammers)
I should have,

37:55.948 --> 37:58.648
regardless of how
I thought you'd react.

37:58.683 --> 38:01.918
But I don't want you to think
that my turning down tenure

38:01.954 --> 38:04.787
has anything to do with
wanting to move in with you.

38:04.823 --> 38:06.556
But it does, JT. It has
everything to do with it.

38:06.591 --> 38:08.158
Don't you see that?

38:08.193 --> 38:10.125
You realized you don't
want to be a professor

38:10.161 --> 38:12.061
for the rest of
your life, right?

38:12.096 --> 38:13.563
You made a decision,

38:13.598 --> 38:15.397
a gutsy one,
even though you have

38:15.433 --> 38:17.433
no idea what you want
to do now, right?

38:18.970 --> 38:20.436
Well, yeah, I guess.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.839
But see, I, I do
know what I want.

38:22.874 --> 38:24.440
I'm not confused.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.675
I'm not searching
like you are.

38:28.479 --> 38:30.980
And yes, the-the past
couple of years

38:31.015 --> 38:32.982
have been really, really crazy

38:33.017 --> 38:35.684
and I fought really, really hard
to get my life back...

38:37.021 --> 38:40.622
...personally, professionally.

38:40.657 --> 38:43.157
But I know what I want.

38:43.193 --> 38:46.695
And what I want is
to move in with you.

38:46.730 --> 38:48.363
Now I'm ready, but you're not.

38:48.398 --> 38:51.099
Not anymore.

38:51.134 --> 38:53.835
Otherwise, you would've finished
packing a long time ago.

38:53.871 --> 38:56.371
And you know it.

38:56.406 --> 38:59.207
Just be honest.

38:59.242 --> 39:01.476
But I love you.

39:04.047 --> 39:06.614
I love you, too.

39:06.649 --> 39:09.350
We would be so stupid
to take the next step

39:09.386 --> 39:11.319
without you finding what...

39:11.354 --> 39:13.554
whatever the hell it
is you're looking for.

39:18.394 --> 39:21.929
So, where do we go
from here?

39:25.234 --> 39:27.601
I don't know.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.322
Honey?

39:50.358 --> 39:51.824
(groans)

39:51.860 --> 39:53.760
Aw, baby, how was your day?

39:53.795 --> 39:55.227
(sighs)
Oh, you know,

39:55.263 --> 39:57.229
same old, same old.

39:57.265 --> 40:00.767
Oh, by the way, our
electricity got cut off

40:00.802 --> 40:03.169
and our rent check bounced.

40:03.204 --> 40:04.670
I thought Heather was...

40:04.705 --> 40:07.339
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I fired her already.

40:07.375 --> 40:09.341
She sounded relieved actually.

40:09.377 --> 40:12.010
Said our lives
were out of control

40:12.046 --> 40:13.579
and too hard to manage.

40:13.614 --> 40:16.215
That we already know.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.451
So, got any ideas
what we're gonna do about it?

40:18.486 --> 40:21.019
Nope, not a one.

40:21.055 --> 40:22.554
Great.
(groans)

40:22.590 --> 40:23.956
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where does it hurt?

40:23.991 --> 40:25.591
You mean where
doesn't it hurt?

40:25.626 --> 40:27.292
Uh-huh.
I admit, you know,

40:27.327 --> 40:29.394
I really like kicking ass.

40:29.429 --> 40:32.297
I do not like having my ass kicked.
Ditto.

40:32.332 --> 40:34.399
Uh-huh.
What are we gonna do?

40:34.434 --> 40:36.902
I mean, we're no closer
to finding whoever's put up

40:36.937 --> 40:39.137
this bounty than when we first
got back from our honeymoon.

40:39.172 --> 40:41.872
Okay, so maybe we haven't
passed all the tests yet.

40:41.908 --> 40:44.142
But we will figure
out a way, Vincent.

40:44.177 --> 40:46.244
We always do.

40:46.279 --> 40:48.713
Although I'm
starting to doubt

40:48.748 --> 40:50.582
if there really
is a beast bounty.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.117
I mean, we keep looking.

40:52.152 --> 40:54.118
We keep bringing in bad guys,

40:54.153 --> 40:55.620
but nobody's attacked since.

40:55.655 --> 40:57.888
What if that bounty
hunter was lying?

40:57.924 --> 40:59.624
What if he was working alone?

41:00.209 --> 41:01.708
Maybe.

41:01.743 --> 41:03.677
But on the other hand,
if he wasn't lying,

41:03.712 --> 41:05.779
and we let our guard down...
Yeah, then we're screwed.

41:05.814 --> 41:07.147
I know.
Yeah.

41:07.183 --> 41:08.382
In that case,

41:08.417 --> 41:10.016
there's only one thing
left to do.

41:10.052 --> 41:11.951
Yeah, and what's that?

41:11.987 --> 41:13.252
Oh.

41:16.524 --> 41:18.891
(laughs)

41:19.193 --> 41:20.225
I like it.
Uh-huh.

41:20.261 --> 41:22.346
Ow!
Oh, sorry.

41:23.764 --> 41:25.730
No hands.
No hands.
