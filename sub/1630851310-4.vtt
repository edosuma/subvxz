00:07.700 --> 00:09.700
The victim is Laura Jennings.

00:09.701 --> 00:12.201
A swimming instructor
at the local pool.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Ron Radford was Laura's ex.
He's the one that abused her?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.440
You should have said
that he was ex-police.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.480
She was pregnant. About six weeks.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.320
I'm on an online sperm donor site.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.600
I'm doing nothing wrong.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.840
You're my garden angel.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.600
This is Cara.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.240
"I'm looking for your brother.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.640
"He's my dad."

00:41.640 --> 00:44.240
A daughter? Could you do
a DNA test for me?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.680
You don't know she's mine.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.960
You don't know she isn't.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.240
Tim Garrick. Laura researched
the hell out of him.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.080
Address, workplace, school.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.200
It turns out his wife
was reported missing two years ago.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.880
I think we've found Joanna Garrick.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.520
There's something else here.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.960
Could be another body.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.720
The body of the female
is in a state of decomposition.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.280
Evidence of blood stains.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.560
Potential site of entry wound.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.280
Looks like a single stab wound.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.200
We have what appears to be
a dark pattern mark

02:49.200 --> 02:50.960
on the male body's face.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.680
Possibly a full-thickness burn.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.920
What is it?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.200
I don't know.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.560
If there are any burns,
residue of carbon?

03:09.760 --> 03:11.960
In areas beneath the clothing,

03:11.960 --> 03:14.440
decomposition appears
slightly delayed.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.480
We have a similar pattern mark
on the right hand.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.360
The dark deposits
in the upper airways and trachea -

03:44.360 --> 03:45.680
I think it's charcoal.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.200
She's got a pacemaker.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.760
Do we know if Joanna Garrick
had a heart condition?

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
So pacemakers store data about
heart rate and stress patterns,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.560
like a mini computer.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.440
So if this had enough memory,

04:10.440 --> 04:12.520
it should show
all event information,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.160
up to the point of death.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.560
Even a time and date.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.440
OK. What am I after?

04:28.440 --> 04:30.360
Something metal.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.480
Like a grid about an inch apart.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.120
Like a grill?

04:51.560 --> 04:52.800
From a barbecue?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.600
Mm-hm.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.000
If he was pushed in headfirst,
burnt his face,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.080
puts his hand out to try to stop it?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.440
His airways could have swollen.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.160
Death by inhalation of hot gases.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.640
Thanks, Jack.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.960
Nice work.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.800
Ssh! Kids,
your daddy's working.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.120
You'll give him a headache.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.720
Who's giving me a headache?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.920
Wasn't she the one
from the swimming pool?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.080
No, don't think so.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.000
Is the man coming back?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.120
What man?

05:49.120 --> 05:50.840
The man at the shops.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.600
What happened at the shops?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.680
Somebody helped us with our bags.
That's all.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.640
It was nothing.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.360
My dinosaur killed his cat.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.960
Did he?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.880
You be good for your mum now, OK?
OK.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.240
I did see the man.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.280
Where?

06:48.320 --> 06:49.600
What's cooking?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.680
I'm pretty sure it's human.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.760
Well, the Garricks'
dental records are in and...

06:55.760 --> 06:57.720
Cara. What are you doing here?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.440
Sorry, Nikki. Adam?

07:09.520 --> 07:11.360
Oh, it's-it's not what you think.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.600
Paedophile? Who's a paedophile?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.360
Oh, my God, no, no, no.
She thinks Ryan's a paedophile.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.920
He's not. He's not.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.440
No.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.280
Er...it's complicated.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.240
He arranged for another man...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.920
..to have sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.800
What happened to the girl?

07:52.440 --> 07:53.640
She died.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.240
It wasn't Ryan...

08:04.960 --> 08:07.280
..but it happened because of him.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.520
"I never want to meet him.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.400
"Who wants a father like that?

08:14.400 --> 08:17.240
"He's scum."
Cara... Cara. Please.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.440
Cara! Cara! Cara!

08:20.360 --> 08:21.880
I didn't know how to tell you.

08:24.440 --> 08:25.800
I'm sorry.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.680
Our female victim's
most likely cause of death

08:38.680 --> 08:42.720
was the penetrating wound
to the abdominal aorta.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.280
Now, as far as we can tell,
given the condition of the uterus,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.160
her os appeared nulliparous,

08:49.160 --> 08:51.320
which means that
she hasn't given birth,

08:51.320 --> 08:53.800
which fits with Joanna Garrick's
medical records

08:53.800 --> 08:56.000
of three failed rounds of IVF.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.800
But...there's no mention
of a pacemaker

08:58.800 --> 09:00.840
or any issues with her heart.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.560
So it's not her.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.880
Well, I couldn't initially
say that for sure.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.320
There's always the possibility

09:07.320 --> 09:09.680
that a pacemaker
was fitted in an emergency -

09:09.680 --> 09:12.240
maybe the hospital
didn't forward the information.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.280
But the Garricks' dental records
just came in.

09:15.280 --> 09:20.800
Now, this is an X-ray
of our female victim,

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
and this the male.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.880
That's not Joanna Garrick.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.520
And he's not Tim Garrick either.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.640
Then where are the Garricks?

09:38.640 --> 09:40.320
Why was Laura at their house?

09:42.160 --> 09:43.480
And who are they?

09:44.760 --> 09:46.320
We don't know,

09:46.320 --> 09:49.320
but every pacemaker
has an individual serial number,

09:49.320 --> 09:51.840
which is usually
on the patient's files.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.160
I've contacted
the Danish manufacturer

09:54.160 --> 09:56.480
to find which hospital it went to.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.080
We'll find out who she was,
and that should help with him.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.320
Thank you.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.800
How can no-one miss them, eh?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.320
Right. I'm heading back now.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.280
When was this?

10:20.360 --> 10:22.000
She's a teenager.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.320
She'll come round.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.960
Ryan doesn't want to meet her.
Cara doesn't want to meet him.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.760
She'll go back to where she came
from and we'll never see her again.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.240
Problem solved.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.960
She's family.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.720
I didn't even know she existed
until a few days ago. It's fine.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.160
Really?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.200
Adam? Yep?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.320
You're a Forensic Medical Examiner?

10:46.360 --> 10:47.840
Yes. What's going on?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.960
Frank Johnson's been attacked.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.680
Frank the Wank? Yeah.
They just identified him.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.200
You ready?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.160
Is there nothing he can't do?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.640
Your blood pressure's rather high,
Molly.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.280
We need to keep an eye on that.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.400
Don't want you
having another stroke.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.960
Dr Renn's prescribed antibiotics
for the UTI.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.920
Make sure you keep drinking
plenty of liquids,

11:34.920 --> 11:37.600
or you'll end up in hospital again.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.520
I don't like your bedside.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.680
Keep talking around the subject,
Molly.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.920
The words will come.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.160
Table.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.680
Make sure she drinks enough.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.760
I'm still here.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.360
My bonnie boy.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.520
My chickadee.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.600
I want my bonnie boy.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.480
Not now.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.720
I'm...

12:20.720 --> 12:22.600
..kerplunk.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.480
Broken ribs.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.360
Skull fracture,
extradural haemorrhage.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.000
Acute bleed between
the dura mater and the skull.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.880
They operated to relieve
intracranial pressure.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.120
The artery on the side
of his brain was bleeding.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.440
He could have died.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.040
Does he have any brain damage?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.880
Is he going to wake up?

12:54.280 --> 12:55.440
I don't know.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.160
Significant bruising on the torso.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.320
Distinct tramline bruising,

13:34.320 --> 13:37.960
which occurs when struck
with a cylindrical object.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.120
Like an iron bar, or a bat?

13:43.400 --> 13:47.200
Same on the arm,
suggesting defensive action.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.520
Probably trying to protect
his head and face.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.760
Mrs Johnson?

14:18.840 --> 14:20.000
We met before.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.160
I'm sorry about Frank.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.440
Is there anything you can tell me
about the night he was attacked?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.760
I've already spoken to the police.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.760
I'm taking over
the investigation now.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.000
He went to work.
He didn't come back.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.160
Were you at home?

14:40.560 --> 14:41.720
Was anyone with you?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.160
Rocco.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.200
The dog?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.320
I got into the shed.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.960
I know what he was doing.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.120
He lied to me.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.360
All this time
he said he didn't want kids.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.920
But look what he's done.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.480
Bastard!

15:21.560 --> 15:23.680
I hope you die!

15:23.680 --> 15:26.000
You bastard!

15:30.560 --> 15:34.640
Blood spatter patterns
show multiple blows, a dozen plus.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.960
This wasn't a quick smash-and-grab.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.720
I found shards of wood,
which I've identified as ash,

15:39.720 --> 15:41.320
commonly used for baseball bats.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.160
That fits with
the tramline bruising.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.000
And look here -

15:45.000 --> 15:48.280
it matches the splinter
from under Frank's skin.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.840
I found a slice
of what could be leather

15:50.840 --> 15:54.520
snagged on a wood fragment,
possibly from a glove?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.040
Waiting for results
on any usable DNA.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.360
Frank's attacker
would be highly bloodstained.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.160
You'd think someone would notice.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.720
Not if you know what you're doing.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.160
He's come prepared, evaded CCTV.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.400
Radford knows how people get caught.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.400
You think Ron Radford did this?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.480
But there's no evidence
to support that yet.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.120
Thought he was in custody. Got bail.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.640
And he's got an alibi -
cosying up with his girlfriend.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.000
She's lying.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.200
This is no random mugging.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.960
Ron was obsessed with Laura,

16:25.960 --> 16:28.000
and Frank was the man
that got her pregnant.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.200
But he doesn't know that.
Or anything about Frank.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.280
Want to bet?

16:31.280 --> 16:34.480
Could be a coincidence.
I don't trust coincidences.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.280
Or you don't trust your team?

16:40.240 --> 16:42.280
I think someone tipped him off.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.680
I just can't prove it.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.080
 Oi-oi! Ha-hey! Oi, love.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.240
Cara?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.720
Give us a smile! Let's go
and have a drink. Come on, love.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.160
Just come and have a drink.
We're having a party at my place.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.320
Come back to my place.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.760
Where are you?

17:51.760 --> 17:54.000
Come on, let's go. We're going to
have a party at mine.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.480
I don't know what that means!
Cara!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.240
Oh, f...

18:13.720 --> 18:15.160
I need your help.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.200
She's upset. I think she's drunk.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.160
Get upset, get drunk -
that's something you have in common.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.400
I'm just saying.
Can't you go any faster? Where to?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.720
Jeez, my grandmother drives
faster than you.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.440
Get her to find a street sign and
take a picture. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.360
Got it. Where is she?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.480
Addlesham Road,
just off the high street.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
Thank you for this.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.640
That's OK.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.200
What are friends for?

19:22.640 --> 19:24.320
I'm growing on you.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.400
Yeah. Like a rash.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.880
Is that her? Where? See?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.000
Yeah. Pull in. Pull over. Pull over.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.600
One sec.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.080
Er...

19:58.160 --> 20:02.120
This is Cara.
She's not very well.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.680
Cara, this is your grandad.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.080
Your gran-dad.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.640
Here's a toothbrush.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.400
Oh, Christ.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.080
There's more. There's always more.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.440
That's it, that's it!

21:00.440 --> 21:01.880
There we go.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.200
Whoa! Are you all right? Bro...

21:19.080 --> 21:20.440
What was that?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.800
Go on, get him.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.920
I'll get you for this, Simples!

21:32.560 --> 21:34.400
Open up this door, man!

21:34.400 --> 21:38.880
Open this up! You're dead!

21:43.920 --> 21:45.120
We'll have him.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.400
Fry an egg on that!

22:16.400 --> 22:18.160
Come and warm yourself by the fire!

22:35.880 --> 22:38.680
This is my reconstruction
of the unknown woman.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.600
The data came in from the pacemaker

22:40.600 --> 22:42.520
with the time and the date of death.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.480
She died two years ago,
on the 13th of April.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.720
I used phenotypic DNA testing
for hair and eye colour.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.240
So that's our mystery woman.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.240
Whoever she was.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.840
Coffee?

23:14.440 --> 23:15.840
Morning. Morning.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.680
Ah. Yeah.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.400
Belonged to your grandmother.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.040
You want it?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.800
Yeah, go for your life.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.600
A little magpie, that one. Aye.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.960
There you go.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.160
Cara? Cara?

23:54.640 --> 23:57.440
Your mum. Your mum?
I should call her.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.120
Want to see?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.000
The other one.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.480
Yeah. That's your...

24:36.080 --> 24:37.280
That's Ryan.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.080
You be careful.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.200
Someone's going to get hurt.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.200
OK. How can I help you?

25:54.200 --> 25:57.040
I'm worried someone's
been in my garden, or my house.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.320
Can I get a description?

25:59.320 --> 26:01.840
Sorry. No. I didn't see anyone.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.320
I did. I think it was a ghost.

26:04.320 --> 26:07.120
You're lying.
No, I'm not. Tell him, Mummy.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.400
I think I should...
We could start with your name?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.080
Sally.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.480
Sally what?

26:23.840 --> 26:26.520
Is there something you'd like to
talk about without the children?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.840
Maybe to a female officer?

26:30.640 --> 26:34.360
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
This has been a mistake.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.880
Let's go.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.760
Jack.
Oh, I'm going to make your day.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.800
The results on the slice of leather
from the wood in Frank's attack,

26:51.800 --> 26:54.760
there were skin cells on
the underside. We got a DNA match.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.720
It's Ron Radford.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.960
You were right.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.360
Ronald Radford, I'm arresting you

27:08.360 --> 27:11.240
on suspicion of grievous
bodily harm. Yeah. Of who?

27:11.240 --> 27:13.600
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

27:13.600 --> 27:15.240
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

27:15.240 --> 27:17.040
something which you
later rely on in Court.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.160
You're talking nonsense.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.000
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.680
Yeah, I know this bit. Do you
understand? Yeah, I understand. Who?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.160
Frank Johnson. Never heard of him.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.440
You're setting me up, aren't you?
She's setting me up.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.280
We're looking at GBH
at the very least,

27:28.280 --> 27:31.160
but I'm going to push the CPS
for attempted murder.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.520
Mike? You're talking rubbish.
I don't know the man.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.280
But you knew
he was being investigated

27:35.280 --> 27:37.360
in connection with Laura's murder?
Was he? Mm.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.160
Well, if that's the case,
and he's guilty,

27:39.160 --> 27:42.120
then I'm glad he was attacked.
I'd like to buy that man a drink.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.440
When this Frank comes round,
are you going to charge him?

27:44.440 --> 27:45.640
Are you up to it?

27:45.640 --> 27:49.120
If Frank Johnson recovers, then no.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.000
But if he dies, then
you'll be charged with murder.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.360
Full disclosure.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.800
We found your DNA
at the crime scene.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.760
You're loving this, aren't you?

27:57.760 --> 27:59.960
Hello?

28:01.480 --> 28:02.760
Frank Johnson?

28:05.080 --> 28:06.520
What time was this?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.080
Hello?

29:03.080 --> 29:05.480
Jack? It's me.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.600
Ryan?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.360
Um...

29:10.360 --> 29:12.480
I've been thinking about Cara,
and...

29:14.240 --> 29:15.760
..I'd really like to meet her.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.240
Er...

29:20.880 --> 29:24.480
Right, um, you said
you didn't want to.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.280
As soon as I told you
she was deaf, you...

29:26.280 --> 29:28.040
It wasn't that. I swear to you.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.160
OK. Look, maybe I was scared.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.680
It was a bit of shock, you know?

29:36.680 --> 29:39.040
Just needed time to
get my head around it all.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.640
Uh-huh.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.360
If Aoife says she's mine,
she's mine.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.880
Even if she was unfaithful, that
doesn't mean I'm not the father.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.720
I don't need a DNA test.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.520
I just...just need a second chance.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.240
This has happened for a reason.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.720
Cara, now.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.160
I think we need each other.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.040
Well...I need her.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.840
I've got a daughter, Jack.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.720
Yeah. Um, Ryan...

30:18.960 --> 30:20.360
Ryan, I'm sorry.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.400
I didn't mean for it to happen,
but I, er...

30:26.400 --> 30:27.720
What is it?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.800
Cara knows you're in prison.
She doesn't want to see you.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.480
Why did you tell her?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.960
I get out soon.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.400
She didn't need to know.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.000
If I could have met her first,
tried to explain...

30:46.000 --> 30:47.520
She'll hate me now.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.080
Ryan, listen, I didn't tell her.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.960
I wouldn't be in here
if it wasn't for you.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.440
I had a life. A woman I loved.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.920
I lost everything!

30:58.360 --> 31:00.560
And now I've lost her too.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.520
I never want to hear from you again.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.000
Ryan? Ryan?

31:34.920 --> 31:36.240
God morgen.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.160
Or is it "god eftermiddag"?

31:39.160 --> 31:42.880
What? We have our dead woman's name.
Sally Trask.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.080
Doesn't sound very Danish.
It isn't. She's from here.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.080
Her pacemaker implantation
wasn't an emergency,

31:49.080 --> 31:52.280
it was a scheduled operation.
Private and paid for.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.480
Why would you go to Denmark

31:53.480 --> 31:55.840
to pay for an operation
you can have free on the NHS?

31:55.840 --> 31:58.760
That's what I said.
Yes, it is rather unusual.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.760
What was wrong with her heart?

32:00.760 --> 32:03.160
Well, according to
the Danish hospital report,

32:03.160 --> 32:05.160
sick sinus syndrome.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.800
Irregular heartbeat.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.640
When we thought the body
was Joanna Garrick,

32:08.640 --> 32:10.120
I pulled up her medical records,

32:10.120 --> 32:12.600
and the odd thing is
they're almost identical.

32:12.600 --> 32:17.280
They're both the same age, both had
repeated failed attempts at IVF.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.480
The lengths they went to
to have a family.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.160
Poor Sally.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.240
You go though all that, and then you
end up dead on a slab with nothing.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.920
Marie fell pregnant
straight away with ours.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.120
I just have to look at her,
and...boomph.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.520
Oh.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.040
Anyway...

32:38.760 --> 32:40.040
He's got super sperm.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.080
What do you think about
the whole "having kids" thing?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.360
I try not to think about it.

32:50.880 --> 32:55.040
I remember joking with Harry once
that I'd end up a dried old prune.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.000
Ten years later, it's not so funny.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.200
I don't know.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.560
Work, life.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.840
Before you know it, you're 100
years old and growing facial hair.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.240
I think you'd look good
with a ginger beard.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.720
It's Cara.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.880
It's beautiful. I love it!

33:26.120 --> 33:28.480
Even better than before.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.360
Thank you.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.320
Adam? Come and tell her I love it.
OK.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.040
Don't think I need to.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.040
Jack? Look what Cara did. Fixed it.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
Wow! That's amazing.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.720
You're like a proud dad.
Meredith's on the phone for you.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.400
Hm? "She's very pretty.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.080
"Do you like her?"

34:00.080 --> 34:03.120
Er...I think that's enough of that.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.920
Here, Adam,
I need to tell Cara something.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.320
Would you mind?

34:09.160 --> 34:11.720
Er, Cara, your dad...

34:13.320 --> 34:14.520
..he's not a bad man.

34:16.840 --> 34:20.640
He, er, he made a mistake
and he paid for it.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.240
Could you give him a chance?
Will you think about it?

34:37.480 --> 34:38.680
For me?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.680
"For me."

34:43.960 --> 34:45.520
For me.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.680
Meredith sent these links across.

34:55.680 --> 34:58.720
This is CCTV from outside the pool
on the Saturday,

34:58.720 --> 35:00.360
the day before Laura was killed.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.960
And here's CCTV from the street
with the Garrick house,

35:07.960 --> 35:09.520
where she went the next day.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.160
That's Laura arriving. Mm-hm.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.600
There.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.480
She was being followed? Exactly.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.400
The scooter only has a numberplate
on the back,

35:25.400 --> 35:27.360
so there's no screen grab
for the registration.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.480
What about ANPR? They're onto it.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.400
Meredith's getting back to me.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.160
Did you see the update
on Sally Trask?

35:34.160 --> 35:36.000
No.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.080
Look at this.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.280
Meredith sent over
her passport photo,

35:42.280 --> 35:45.240
and here's my reconstruction.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.080
Ta-dah!

35:47.080 --> 35:49.120
Oh, you're good.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.520
And this is Sally's husband,
Michael Trask,

35:52.520 --> 35:56.000
which matches my reconstruction
of the other dead body.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.400
You are talented.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.080
Oh...

36:01.080 --> 36:03.760
Hey, Meredith.
Just talking about you.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.280
Any luck with our scooter?

36:05.280 --> 36:08.080
Yeah. It's registered
to a Simon Morton.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.120
I'll text you his address now.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.320
Great. On my way. Bye.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.720
Not getting jealous, are you?

36:18.720 --> 36:20.080
Just go!

36:53.480 --> 36:54.560
Jack?

36:55.920 --> 36:58.360
He works at Daisybeck Nursing Home.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.400
OK. Let's go.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.840
May we come in? Mm.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.280
We're looking for Simon.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.600
No tree.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.640
If he's not here,
I have no idea where he can be.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.560
He can't have come in today,
and that's not like him at all.

37:22.880 --> 37:23.920
Meredith.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.720
Isn't that our man, Trask?

37:31.520 --> 37:34.800
Yeah, it looks like both of them.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.760
That's your son, isn't it, Molly?

37:36.760 --> 37:39.080
My...my Michael.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.520
Over the ocean.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.960
They emigrated to Australia.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.280
It's all right for them,
going off and starting a new life,

37:50.280 --> 37:51.680
and leaving Molly here.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.160
How do you know?

37:56.160 --> 37:58.480
Oh, they sent me an email.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.880
Do you still have it?

38:01.080 --> 38:02.560
Has something happened?

38:23.240 --> 38:27.240
Where's my bonnie boy?

38:34.040 --> 38:36.200
Oh...

38:51.360 --> 38:54.520
Simon must know
Molly's house is empty.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.960
Well, someone's been here.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.200
And recently, by the looks.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.600
Nikki? Can this wait? Not really.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.680
I just spoke to Sally Trask's GP.

39:04.680 --> 39:08.040
I think I know why she went
to Denmark for her operation.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.680
She didn't want it
on her medical records.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.480
She needed a clean bill of health.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.560
The Trasks were trying
to adopt at the time.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.240
And they did.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.680
They had two children.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.880
Thanks, Nikki.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.000
Meredith?

39:30.600 --> 39:32.400
Nobody said they had kids.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.760
They adopted them.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.280
Did we miss them at the Garricks?

39:41.280 --> 39:44.160
Ah, God.
Tell me they're not buried there.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.400
We need to go back.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.040
No, we don't. Look.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
They look older here.

40:00.720 --> 40:05.280
He looks like the guy
in Laura's old school year book.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.600
Tim Garrick?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.480
Yeah.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.480
It's fresh mud.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.360
Simon?

40:53.080 --> 40:54.720
Is he fit to interview?

40:54.720 --> 40:57.480
I believe he has mutism
and social anxiety.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.640
He won't speak under pressure
or in a stressful environment.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.840
There might be
some communication he has

41:02.840 --> 41:04.480
with a family member or a friend.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.720
Yeah, I'll arrange
for an appropriate adult,

41:07.720 --> 41:09.200
someone he knows and trusts.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.600
Simon? What can you tell me
about Laura Jennings?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.560
It's OK, Simon.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.280
If you can tell them anything...

41:42.360 --> 41:43.880
You don't know her?

41:47.200 --> 41:49.720
But you were seen on CCTV,
following her.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.600
That's Laura Jennings.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.080
And that's you.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.560
So why were you following her?

42:20.240 --> 42:21.480
You weren't?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.000
Not her.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.000
Him.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.640
Him.

42:42.600 --> 42:43.920
And who is that?

43:04.760 --> 43:06.000
Him?

43:08.520 --> 43:09.600
OK.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.080
Thank you.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.880
Laura saw Tim Garrick at the pool.
That's what set this off.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.040
Where's that list
of swimming sessions?

43:26.520 --> 43:27.960
Trask.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.080
Dylan Trask and Toby Trask.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.520
Yeah.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.960
Simon was trying to
find Molly's family.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.320
He found her grandkids...

43:39.760 --> 43:41.680
..and this man with them.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.600
He doesn't know what his name is,
but he knows what it isn't.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.480
It's not Molly's son, Michael Trask.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.680
The social worker who handled
the Trasks' adoption got back to me.

43:58.680 --> 44:01.040
She said that,
as far as they were concerned,

44:01.040 --> 44:02.680
the adoption had gone smoothly

44:02.680 --> 44:05.880
and that the Trasks
had then moved to Australia.

44:05.880 --> 44:09.520
She also said that
the Trasks knew the Garricks.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.720
Apparently, they had met on a course

44:11.720 --> 44:14.160
for parents
who were trying to adopt.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.640
But the Garricks were rejected.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.960
The panel felt
that Joanna was still grieving

44:18.960 --> 44:21.960
after her last failed attempt
at IVF.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.760
And there were question marks
about her medical history,

44:24.760 --> 44:26.600
anti-depressants...

44:26.600 --> 44:29.200
But Tim was also an issue.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.400
Coercive control?

44:32.400 --> 44:33.960
It came up in a reference.

44:33.960 --> 44:36.160
And, of course,
he wasn't happy about that.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.440
Well, look at that.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.560
The money from the sale
of the Garricks' house

44:44.560 --> 44:47.520
was transferred to an account
in the name of Michael Trask.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.920
We couldn't find the Garricks
because they became the Trasks.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.680
One couple took the lives
of the other,

44:54.680 --> 44:56.720
and stole their children.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.840
And nobody missed them,
apart from Molly.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.200
Then Laura saw Tim
and knew who he really was...

45:05.360 --> 45:06.640
..so he killed her.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.040
Thanks, Nikki.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.160
Joanna.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.560
Don't talk to anyone.

45:36.560 --> 45:37.880
Don't come back.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.280
Tim Garrick, I'm arresting you
in connection with the murders

45:43.280 --> 45:46.120
of Laura Jennings,
Sally Trask, Michael Trask,

45:46.120 --> 45:48.800
and the abduction
of Dylan and Toby Trask.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.240
Dylan? Toby?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.400
Anything?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.960
No.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.400
Where's your wife, Tim?
Where are the children?

46:12.720 --> 46:16.000
Where are they?
She went to the shops.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.200
She'll be back soon.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.200
So you didn't just ring her up
to warn her off?

46:20.200 --> 46:21.240
No.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.040
I rang to check on her.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.160
She's not been well.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.440
Laura Jennings
recognised you at the pool.

46:34.080 --> 46:37.120
She tracked you down,
found your old house.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.240
She was on to you.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.880
Camera?

46:40.880 --> 46:42.960
She could ruin everything.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.760
Supposition.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.360
You can't prove it.

46:46.360 --> 46:49.480
Oh, we can. We found the same DNA
on all three bodies,

46:49.480 --> 46:51.720
and I'm willing to bet it's yours.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.120
How could you do that
to the Trasks?

46:54.120 --> 46:55.520
This was their life.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.040
Not yours.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.920
You stole their children.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.080
They didn't deserve them.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.720
They got them under false pretences.

47:05.720 --> 47:07.200
No.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.960
You don't deserve to be a parent.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.720
I love my kids.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.120
Then tell me where they are.

47:16.280 --> 47:17.920
Where would your wife take them?

47:21.720 --> 47:23.160
No comment.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.320
Meredith. Meredith!

47:50.200 --> 47:53.120
Found a tracker on his phone.
We can find her with this.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.240
Great.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.920
Come on.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.920
What's going on?

48:11.920 --> 48:13.160
Joanna?

48:14.920 --> 48:16.200
No, it's Sally.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.040
Where's my husband?

48:18.040 --> 48:20.960
Joanna, my name's Meredith.
I'm with the police.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.600
I can help you,
but you need to come in.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.120
You need to talk to me.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.040
Are the kids OK?

48:34.480 --> 48:35.680
Joanna?

48:36.840 --> 48:38.120
Are you still there?

48:39.960 --> 48:41.320
It's all my fault.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.840
I'm Sally now.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.600
I am keeping her alive.
She deserves to be alive.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.200
Joanna doesn't.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.320
Oh, shit!

49:03.920 --> 49:06.120
It's OK. We've still got her.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.160
Hey.

50:03.640 --> 50:06.040
Don't hate me, OK?

50:06.040 --> 50:07.120
Don't hate me.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.240
You all right, Tobes?

50:10.240 --> 50:12.640
Hey, look at this.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.120
Would you like it?

50:15.520 --> 50:17.480
This was your other mummy's.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.080
We both loved you very much.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.680
Mummy loves you.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.320
I always have.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.400
And I always will.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.080
Hi.

53:16.080 --> 53:17.760
Are you all right?

53:17.760 --> 53:19.560
Where's your mummy?

53:19.560 --> 53:21.160
Where's Mum? Jack...

53:23.360 --> 53:24.720
..is that her?

55:18.080 --> 55:19.960
Hey.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.360
Are they all OK?

55:21.360 --> 55:22.680
All good.

55:22.680 --> 55:23.880
Where's Jack?

55:27.680 --> 55:29.640
Here he is.

55:29.640 --> 55:31.600
The hero of the hour.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.280
Nah. You must mean some other guy.

55:39.040 --> 55:41.240
Keys. I'll drive us home.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.320
All right.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.200
What happened to you
at the shoreline?

55:48.960 --> 55:50.000
Can't swim.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.480
At last - something he can't do.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.440
You should keep warm. Mm-hm.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.280
Bye.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.000
Bye, Meredith.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.400
Thanks.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.960
All right?

57:02.960 --> 57:04.080
Are you...

57:05.080 --> 57:06.520
..ready...

57:08.280 --> 57:11.000
..to see Ryan?

57:22.320 --> 57:24.520
My little chickadee.
