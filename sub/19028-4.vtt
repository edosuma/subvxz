00:03.952 --> 00:06.466
<i>Elliot had just finished
her last shift at Sacred Heart</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.219
<i>before starting her new career
in private practise.</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:10.607
I can't believe it's all over.

00:10.792 --> 00:15.229
God, so many memories.
So many, many memories.

00:17.632 --> 00:19.782
Who wants to say something first?

00:20.218 --> 00:23.688
Elliot, your new office is right there.

00:23.972 --> 00:26.088
Nothing's gonna change
but your lab coat.

00:26.308 --> 00:27.946
Anyone else want to go?

00:30.020 --> 00:33.171
<i>Speaking of new jobs, I wasn't
thrilled that my pregnant girlfriend</i>

00:33.440 --> 00:35.476
<i>was offered
a research grant in Tacoma.</i>

00:35.692 --> 00:38.570
<i>On the up side, I could give her
dramatic "don't-go" kisses</i>

00:38.820 --> 00:40.139
<i>whenever I felt like it.</i>

00:40.322 --> 00:44.156
That was hot, stud, but I think it's
just my leg that's supposed to be up.

00:46.536 --> 00:47.889
Oh, J.D.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.674
This is going to be
such a tough decision,

00:50.916 --> 00:51.905
'cause I don't know
if you're aware of this,

00:52.084 --> 00:55.201
- but I've been really digging you lately.
- Oh, I'm aware, baby.

00:55.462 --> 00:57.373
<i>Oh, my God, she likes me!</i>

00:57.589 --> 00:59.102
Still, I'd only be gone four months,

00:59.299 --> 01:00.573
and you don't want to be around me
when I'm pregnant.

01:00.759 --> 01:01.828
All the women in my family go psycho.

01:02.010 --> 01:04.285
- Yeah, but Kim...
- I wasn't finished!

01:05.806 --> 01:06.841
You know, I'm back. I'm back.

01:07.015 --> 01:08.448
It's perfectly fine. Just hit the wall.

01:08.642 --> 01:10.997
Look, whatever your decision is,
I support you.

01:11.895 --> 01:13.726
You're so awesome, J.D.

01:14.231 --> 01:16.426
<i>My lips taste weird.</i>

01:17.818 --> 01:20.855
Hey. Look who I brought
to see her mama.

01:21.238 --> 01:22.637
Somebody else's child?

01:24.700 --> 01:26.338
We got a code pink, people!

01:26.535 --> 01:28.491
Somebody just stole a baby.

01:29.913 --> 01:31.392
Just shut that.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:46.596 --> 01:49.827
Baby, so, after I take this kid back to
the nursery, I was thinking

01:50.100 --> 01:52.250
maybe we could pack up you
and Isabella and head home?

01:52.519 --> 01:55.033
Turk, I can't handle going home
right now.

01:55.272 --> 01:57.581
This place is really expensive, honey.

01:57.816 --> 01:59.932
Now, I don't know if you know this,
but the ice packs you've been putting

02:00.152 --> 02:02.620
on your hooey run about
42 bucks a pop.

02:02.863 --> 02:06.333
My body's a disaster zone right now,
but it will get better,

02:06.616 --> 02:08.174
so if you want to get near it ever again,

02:08.368 --> 02:10.359
I would stop talking about money.

02:11.955 --> 02:14.992
All right, who can tell me
anything about Mr Pierce?

02:15.250 --> 02:17.684
He uses oil heaters at his house
in New Hampshire.

02:17.919 --> 02:20.194
That answer was either
very sarcastic or very stupid.

02:20.422 --> 02:22.014
Either way, I'm whacking you
with my clipboard.

02:22.215 --> 02:23.170
- Brace yourself.
- Wait.

02:23.341 --> 02:24.933
He's hypoxic with a clear chest x-ray

02:25.135 --> 02:28.172
which can be a sign of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

02:28.430 --> 02:29.704
<i>I learnt that watching House.</i>

02:29.890 --> 02:31.642
House is a genius.

02:32.684 --> 02:35.437
That's it. I'm whacking both of you.

02:35.687 --> 02:38.724
Look, I know you all curl up
on your futons at night,

02:38.982 --> 02:42.213
dreaming of cracking a real-life
medical mystery so that

02:42.486 --> 02:45.239
some doctor-slash-supermodel will
want to touch your eruption button.

02:45.489 --> 02:48.959
But here's the bad news,
this isn't a TV show.

02:49.242 --> 02:52.712
There aren't any cameras over here.
Real medical mysteries don't happen

02:52.996 --> 02:55.510
every week and doctors damn sure
don't look like models.

02:55.749 --> 02:57.023
They look like Rex.

02:58.877 --> 02:59.832
What?

03:00.003 --> 03:03.712
Chin up, you ugly bastard.
So, if you want to solve a real mystery,

03:04.007 --> 03:05.838
<i>go ahead and figure out who's
taking my New York Times</i>

03:06.051 --> 03:08.849
every Sunday. Or, better yet,

03:09.096 --> 03:12.691
how about why anybody on the planet
actually thinks Dane Cook is funny.

03:12.974 --> 03:16.330
As far as Mr Pierce goes, he has your
run-of-the mill pulmonary embolism.

03:16.603 --> 03:18.559
And I know, I know,

03:18.772 --> 03:20.763
it is a boring medical diagnosis,

03:20.982 --> 03:23.621
but that's what hospitals are. Boring.

03:26.863 --> 03:28.819
Hey, there's that baby you stole.

03:29.032 --> 03:31.023
I kind of miss the little cutie.
We really bonded.

03:31.243 --> 03:33.711
Come on, that kid doesn't
remember you.

03:39.918 --> 03:41.874
So, you're really cool
if Kim decides to take this job?

03:42.087 --> 03:44.362
Hell no, man. She's going to be
all the way in Washington.

03:44.589 --> 03:47.228
And phone sex is out of the question,
because I'm a righty when I talk on

03:47.467 --> 03:50.857
the phone, but I'm also a righty when
I'm teaching mini-J.D. who daddy is.

03:51.388 --> 03:52.741
Can't you work your way around that?

03:52.931 --> 03:55.286
I'm screwed, dude.
I mean, if I ask her to stay,

03:55.517 --> 03:57.109
she's gonna resent me forever.
You know what I gotta do?

03:57.310 --> 04:01.098
I gotta be the best boyfriend ever
so she never wants to leave me.

04:01.398 --> 04:04.788
Turkleton. I need a word.

04:06.445 --> 04:09.437
I wanted to give you
your paycheque in person

04:09.698 --> 04:11.973
so you can hand it back to me
to pay your bill.

04:12.951 --> 04:15.340
- Why don't you just hold onto that, sir?
- That's not how it works.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.896
Now, I'm going to hand it to you
and I want you to look at it,

04:19.166 --> 04:21.077
sigh, and give it back to me.

04:23.837 --> 04:25.031
Splendid!

04:25.213 --> 04:27.727
<i>Nurse Espinosa,
mi hospital es su hospital.</i>

04:27.966 --> 04:30.082
No problemo, chiefo.

04:34.765 --> 04:36.995
Hey, nice new digs.

04:37.225 --> 04:40.058
Looks like you could use
a new coat of paint, though.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.303
If you're interested...

04:44.274 --> 04:45.229
Thank you.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.755
Now I just gotta find someone
to replace this rug.

04:47.986 --> 04:52.138
Air traffic controller, gemologist,
captain of industry, middle reliever,

04:52.449 --> 04:53.928
ruggist.

04:54.785 --> 04:57.299
I invented a machine
that prints business cards.

04:57.871 --> 04:59.429
That's already been invented.

04:59.706 --> 05:01.981
Oh, yeah, I know. But mine

05:02.209 --> 05:04.165
also fires paint pellets.

05:04.378 --> 05:05.697
How about it? Observe.

05:09.716 --> 05:13.789
Curved off to the left. It was working
great yesterday at the zoo.

05:15.389 --> 05:18.938
Doctor Reid, I thought I would just
stop in and say goodbye.

05:19.309 --> 05:21.027
Why? I'll still be working here.

05:21.478 --> 05:24.515
Yes, but you won't be working for
Sacred Heart, the place that spent

05:24.773 --> 05:28.561
a fortune training you, only to
have you take off for greener pastures.

05:28.944 --> 05:31.663
You're like a prostitute that gets
paid up-front and then bolts

05:31.905 --> 05:35.295
from the restaurant after dinner.
It's about common courtesy, Reid.

05:35.951 --> 05:38.704
Whether to your boss or to a
kind-hearted John

05:38.954 --> 05:41.627
who's given you a lot of business
over the years.

05:41.873 --> 05:45.786
So, goodbye, Miss Mei Ling
of Gentle Oriental Escorts,

05:46.086 --> 05:49.078
and goodbye, Dr Reid.

05:49.339 --> 05:52.615
I won't be speaking
to either of you ever again.

05:53.301 --> 05:56.020
Seriously gonna ignore me
because I took another job?

06:00.434 --> 06:03.346
Hey, Sarah. How are you?
I'm Dr Dorian.

06:03.603 --> 06:05.195
Look, you were in and out
of consciousness

06:05.397 --> 06:06.386
when they brought you in.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.237
Do you have any family
you want us to contact?

06:08.483 --> 06:10.075
No, it's just me and my dog, Charlie.

06:10.277 --> 06:12.916
You can try him,
but he rarely answers his cell.

06:14.656 --> 06:16.055
What's Charlie's cell phone number?

06:16.241 --> 06:18.516
1-800-CATS-R-LAME?

06:20.328 --> 06:24.321
Okay. Other than the
obvious loss of your sense of humour,

06:24.624 --> 06:28.617
I understand you've been having
palpitations and shortness of breath.

06:29.296 --> 06:31.730
We'll run some tests
and see what's happening.

06:31.965 --> 06:33.034
There's my girl.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.155
Hey, I got you something. It's a star.

06:36.386 --> 06:38.661
You can get them off this website.
I named it after you.

06:38.889 --> 06:39.878
That's so sweet.

06:40.057 --> 06:43.413
Unfortunately, Kim was taken, so I tried
Kim with two M's, Kim with three M's,

06:43.685 --> 06:46.040
- Kim-1, Kim-2...
- Well, what's it called?

06:46.354 --> 06:48.106
Frecklefart90.

06:49.316 --> 06:51.511
For the freckle on my ass,
my lactose intolerance

06:51.735 --> 06:54.010
and the fact
I graduated high school in 1990.

06:54.488 --> 06:55.477
Yes.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.293
<i>That was so lucky.</i>

06:57.657 --> 06:59.932
How could I ever leave you?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.673
<i>It's working!</i>

07:06.375 --> 07:08.843
Damn it! Is it the sight?

07:13.340 --> 07:14.773
I've been hit.

07:15.926 --> 07:17.154
Not the sight.

07:19.346 --> 07:21.143
Dr Cox, I need your help.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.691
Make it quick. I gotta be somewhere.

07:23.892 --> 07:24.881
Where?

07:25.060 --> 07:27.528
Anywhere you and I aren't talking. Go.

07:27.771 --> 07:29.204
Okay. It's Carla.

07:29.439 --> 07:33.591
I can't get her out of here, and she
listens to you, so I was thinking...

07:33.902 --> 07:35.176
Say no more.

07:36.154 --> 07:40.352
You know, yelling at those interns
made me realise how monotonous it is,

07:40.742 --> 07:44.655
facing the same disease day after day,
and that no matter what I do

07:44.955 --> 07:47.708
to entertain myself, I'm still bored.

07:47.958 --> 07:51.348
Whether it's reading the paper
or shaving the sideburns off

07:51.628 --> 07:55.143
of a resident because his licence plate
says, "PARTY DOC."

07:56.216 --> 07:59.731
By my calculations,
that rant just cost me $27.

08:01.471 --> 08:04.269
- Excuse me, Dr Cox?
- Yes, Party Doc?

08:04.599 --> 08:08.148
I heard crying coming from this room
last night. I thought you should know.

08:09.229 --> 08:11.697
Don't look at me. I wasn't crying.

08:11.940 --> 08:14.898
Maybe it was Mrs Mehleison.
She just had her baby yesterday.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.449
Maybe she got postpartum depression.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.421
One of us needs to check this out.

08:19.614 --> 08:20.763
I got it.

08:21.825 --> 08:23.895
- What?
- I can't do it.

08:24.119 --> 08:26.030
- Why?
- 'Cause her husband is orange.

08:35.172 --> 08:37.003
- Good afternoon.
- What's up?

08:39.509 --> 08:42.501
Oh, Dr Kelso, what radiologist
is on call today?

08:43.722 --> 08:45.713
Oh, right. The silent treatment.

08:45.932 --> 08:48.207
Well, unfortunately for you,
the Reid family has actually been

08:48.435 --> 08:50.505
giving each other the silent treatment
for generations.

08:50.729 --> 08:53.163
There was one time my dad wasn't
talking to my mom because

08:53.398 --> 08:56.674
she stopped boffing the gardener
right at the height of weed season.

08:56.943 --> 08:58.296
I know. She wasn't thinking.

08:58.487 --> 09:00.637
Anyhoo, she finally broke him down
with this little ditty.

09:00.864 --> 09:03.822
Nobody can hear it without chiming in.

09:04.868 --> 09:08.747
<i>Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli</i>

09:09.039 --> 09:12.031
<i>Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli</i>

09:13.710 --> 09:15.541
<i>Lollipop</i>

09:18.090 --> 09:20.160
He was about to crack, Ted.
What the hell?

09:20.384 --> 09:23.376
<i>Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli</i>

09:23.637 --> 09:25.070
<i>Lollipop</i>

09:25.889 --> 09:29.404
Well, your labs are back
and it's definitely heart failure,

09:29.810 --> 09:32.563
but there are no blockages, no virus
is present and you have

09:32.813 --> 09:35.327
no family history of coronary disease.

09:35.732 --> 09:38.485
So why would I have heart failure?

09:38.735 --> 09:41.647
<i>Even though real hospitals aren't like
TV shows, that doesn't mean</i>

09:41.905 --> 09:45.580
<i>there aren't mysteries. Like why
a healthy woman's heart is failing.</i>

09:45.867 --> 09:47.858
<i>Or why a grown man is orange.</i>

09:48.078 --> 09:52.151
Grab a seat, people.
This just got interesting.

09:57.170 --> 09:58.523
Wow.

09:58.714 --> 10:00.591
Elliot, I wouldn't take that if I were you.

10:00.799 --> 10:03.836
<i>Or why a friend is mad at you
instead of the guy being the jerk.</i>

10:04.094 --> 10:05.447
Don't even talk to me.

10:05.637 --> 10:07.514
<i>Of course, for me, the biggest mystery</i>

10:07.723 --> 10:10.874
<i>was what my girlfriend
was gonna do about her job offer.</i>

10:11.143 --> 10:14.499
So I spent the entire day thinking
I can't leave you for four months,

10:14.771 --> 10:17.649
but you're so amazing about the whole
thing that I finally just called them

10:17.899 --> 10:19.457
and accepted the job.

10:19.651 --> 10:21.846
They want me there tonight.
Can you believe it?

10:23.947 --> 10:26.017
Okay! I'm gonna go get us a muffin.

10:28.326 --> 10:29.315
You okay?

10:31.747 --> 10:32.862
Finally.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.788
<i>No.</i>

10:39.733 --> 10:41.610
So, you're sure you don't mind
taking me to the airport tonight?

10:41.818 --> 10:43.297
Of course not, babe.

10:43.486 --> 10:46.046
<i>I had to think of a new plan
to keep Kim from leaving.</i>

10:46.281 --> 10:49.671
<i>Unfortunately, work got in the way.</i>

10:49.951 --> 10:52.419
<i>The only thing worse than not knowing
why a patient is crashing</i>

10:52.662 --> 10:56.018
<i>is being offered help by the hospital's
grief counsellor, Dr Headrick.</i>

10:56.291 --> 10:57.485
Need help, old friend?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.066
Oh, yeah. Her kidneys are failing.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.482
- Give her a pep talk. Stat.
- Yeah, no.

11:01.713 --> 11:02.668
Treating her emotionally,

11:02.839 --> 11:05.034
that would have nothing
to do with her medical well-being.

11:05.258 --> 11:07.533
You know,
maybe instead of lashing out at me

11:07.761 --> 11:11.231
you should turn that anger gun
at the person you're really mad at.

11:11.514 --> 11:14.506
Mommy? Just a guess.

11:14.809 --> 11:17.323
I mean, there's got to be some reason
you're always such a D-bag, right?

11:18.021 --> 11:19.340
D- bag.

11:20.398 --> 11:26.030
Okay, we have a 41-year-old male
who is as orange as an NBA game ball.

11:26.404 --> 11:27.359
Who can tell me why?

11:27.530 --> 11:29.600
- I got an idea.
- Yeah, I got an idea, too.

11:29.824 --> 11:33.100
If you want to work, let's stop paying
for the room, so you can go home.

11:33.370 --> 11:34.883
Then you can come back
and get paid to work.

11:35.288 --> 11:38.803
Turk, I just need a break from the baby.

11:40.335 --> 11:43.771
Mr Mehleison might be a vegetarian.
He's always eating carrots.

11:44.047 --> 11:46.356
But carotene, like jaundice,
turns you yellow,

11:46.591 --> 11:48.547
just like certain blood disorders
turn you blue

11:48.760 --> 11:50.432
and tomatoes can turn you red.

11:50.637 --> 11:54.471
Sadly, there isn't anything on God's
green Earth that turns you orange.

11:55.183 --> 11:57.139
Maybe he got freaky
with some Cheetos.

11:57.352 --> 11:59.229
Swing and a miss, Webster. Next.

11:59.437 --> 12:01.712
Maybe he used some fake tan cream.

12:02.232 --> 12:05.827
I used it once.
Turned me orange all over.

12:06.236 --> 12:08.466
There were no foreign substances
found on his skin.

12:08.697 --> 12:10.927
But kudos, Keith,
on finally outing yourself.

12:13.034 --> 12:17.824
Hello, Stacy, Rebecca, Larry.

12:18.581 --> 12:21.698
Jennifer, Lyle, portly island boy...

12:22.210 --> 12:25.327
Elliot, I can't get Carla
to leave this place.

12:25.922 --> 12:29.153
Yeah, I don't really
give a rat's doo-doo maker, Turk.

12:29.759 --> 12:32.114
- Why does she hate me?
- Don't say "hate," Gandhi.

12:32.345 --> 12:33.858
You kids throw that word
around so much

12:34.055 --> 12:35.454
it's lost all of its meaning.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.790
Now I have to find
a word stronger than hate

12:38.018 --> 12:40.407
to describe how I feel about others.

12:44.774 --> 12:47.607
I mega-loathe you all. Good day.

12:50.905 --> 12:53.373
Here's Dr Cox.
He's one of my colleagues

12:53.616 --> 12:54.890
and he's gonna help me
with your diagnosis.

12:55.076 --> 12:56.270
We're kind of teammates.

12:56.453 --> 12:58.444
So, Sarah here has
the beginnings of what looks like...

12:58.663 --> 12:59.778
I can read a chart, Newbie.

12:59.956 --> 13:02.311
Now, leave before I put
a rhinestone collar around your neck,

13:02.542 --> 13:05.420
have you fixed,
and make you my lap doctor.

13:05.670 --> 13:07.581
- Again, teammates. Okay.
- Go.

13:08.298 --> 13:11.654
I see by your chart here that you are...

13:11.926 --> 13:14.315
- You are single.
- That's right.

13:19.809 --> 13:22.198
<i>Kim's leaving to pack and I still have
no plan to make her stay.</i>

13:22.437 --> 13:23.426
<i>It's go time.</i>

13:23.605 --> 13:25.402
<i>Just say the first thing that pops
into your head.</i>

13:25.607 --> 13:27.245
- Hey, J.D.
- I'm rich.

13:27.442 --> 13:30.002
- You don't have to take that job.
- You're not rich.

13:30.487 --> 13:31.476
Oh, yes, I am, Kim.

13:32.197 --> 13:36.270
And this right here is
my dope-ass Mercedes, okay?

13:41.790 --> 13:45.863
I didn't want to tell you 'cause
I wanted you to like me for me.

13:46.378 --> 13:49.370
- You're an idiot, J.D.
- Am I, Kim?

13:52.092 --> 13:57.928
Dr Tabini. Dr Tabini, I'm on the car.
Larry! Larry! I'm on the car.

14:09.943 --> 14:10.898
There's my girl.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.262
J.D., why didn't you just tell me
you didn't want me to go?

14:14.531 --> 14:18.126
What am I supposed to say, Kim?
"Don't go 'cause I'll miss you"?

14:19.286 --> 14:21.754
Kim, we both know you were
always gonna take that job

14:21.997 --> 14:24.591
and I was always going
to want you not to.

14:24.833 --> 14:28.143
Look, it's only four months.
It's really good for my career.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.354
<i>And then I said something
I wish I hadn't.</i>

14:31.589 --> 14:34.149
Why don't you just do
what's best for you?

14:36.303 --> 14:39.101
You know what?
I'll get myself to the airport.

14:51.651 --> 14:56.247
You usually have to go to a van
convention to see art of this quality.

14:56.573 --> 14:58.564
- You do.
- Gotta confess, though.

14:58.783 --> 15:02.617
I cheated a little bit. I used an actual
head from the morgue as a model.

15:03.204 --> 15:06.116
Be careful, it's actually
around here somewhere.

15:11.379 --> 15:14.576
- I think I heard something break.
- Here you go.

15:17.052 --> 15:18.121
Podiatrist?

15:18.345 --> 15:22.816
I also buy and sell feet. So, any way
you want to go, I got you covered.

15:23.558 --> 15:24.627
Great.

15:34.319 --> 15:37.277
Hey, Elliot,
you gonna finish that muffin?

15:38.406 --> 15:42.001
- Why are you so pissy with us?
- Why is Sarah dying?

15:42.869 --> 15:45.542
Why is that guy orange?

15:45.789 --> 15:48.542
<i>Around here, sometimes you do wish
it was more like TV.</i>

15:49.209 --> 15:52.121
<i>And a bigger-than-life character
like House would just show up</i>

15:52.379 --> 15:54.847
<i>and conveniently solve everything.</i>

15:56.299 --> 16:01.293
Ah, yes, the huddled masses.
Carla, I see you're trying one of

16:01.638 --> 16:04.106
this establishment's disgusting
new tomato muffins.

16:04.349 --> 16:06.544
Do you know who else
just loved tomatoes?

16:06.768 --> 16:09.328
<i>Our little orange friend, Mr Mehleison.</i>

16:09.729 --> 16:12.084
As you correctly pointed out,
the only thing he loved more than

16:12.315 --> 16:15.387
tomatoes were carrots.
And if carrots turn you yellow

16:15.652 --> 16:19.008
and tomatoes turn you red,
what colour would he most likely turn

16:19.280 --> 16:21.714
if he were to gorge himself
on both those items?

16:22.659 --> 16:25.173
- Orange.
- Correct. And Gandhi,

16:25.412 --> 16:27.050
I understand that you are confused

16:27.247 --> 16:29.477
as to why Private Practise Barbie
has a beef

16:29.708 --> 16:31.858
with you and your
scrawny little life partner.

16:32.085 --> 16:33.962
Kelso's the one being the jerk. Not us.

16:34.170 --> 16:38.049
Yes, but even though that horny old
raisin is acting like an ass,

16:38.341 --> 16:41.936
in doing so, he's actually
acknowledging that she's ready

16:42.220 --> 16:46.213
to move on professionally.
Guess who hasn't acknowledged that?

16:46.516 --> 16:49.076
Nothing's gonna change
but your lab coat.

16:49.311 --> 16:52.860
He's right. I mean, lately all this great
stuff's been happening to you guys.

16:53.148 --> 16:54.547
You're settling down
and having babies...

16:54.733 --> 16:57.247
Dear God, Barbie, we get the point.

16:57.485 --> 16:59.077
This would roughly be my time.

17:00.071 --> 17:04.587
Now, Newbie, as far as
your patient is concerned,

17:04.909 --> 17:07.662
Takosobu Cardiomyopathy.

17:07.912 --> 17:10.300
- Ever heard of it?
- I haven't.

17:10.874 --> 17:14.833
Takosobu Cardiomyopathy, also
known as "Broken Heart Syndrome,"

17:15.127 --> 17:17.881
is when a severe emotional trauma
triggers a weakening

17:18.131 --> 17:21.680
of the heart muscle. On her chart
you indicated that she was single,

17:21.968 --> 17:24.607
<i>yet I noticed she was
still wearing her wedding ring.</i>

17:25.763 --> 17:27.321
Turns out her husband had just died

17:27.515 --> 17:29.631
and she wasn't ready to
take the ring off yet.

17:29.851 --> 17:32.809
I'm betting that her grief
over his passing

17:33.063 --> 17:34.621
is what caused her heart failure.

17:34.814 --> 17:38.648
And, no, no, I'm not Superman.

17:39.361 --> 17:42.478
I'm just Dr Cox.

17:44.157 --> 17:45.385
Thanks for the coffee.

17:50.997 --> 17:53.557
She's going to need a lot more
counselling, but we'll get her there.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.181
Well, not "we," so much as me.

17:56.419 --> 17:59.092
I mean, your part, the bungling
of the diagnosis, is done.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.614
I can't believe you can have heart
failure just from being sad.

18:01.841 --> 18:04.674
I mean, how are you
supposed to treat that?

18:07.847 --> 18:11.044
He's coding!
Get me a box of kittens, stat!

18:19.985 --> 18:22.863
Possible side effects of kittens
include sneezing,

18:23.113 --> 18:25.752
tiny scratches and erectile dysfunction.

18:27.575 --> 18:29.645
Wouldn't I be a great spokesperson
for things?

18:29.869 --> 18:30.858
Could you do me a favour?

18:31.037 --> 18:34.313
Next time, just remember to take care
of your patient emotionally.

18:35.458 --> 18:38.894
If someone's in a good place, they heal
quicker. If they're in a negative place,

18:39.170 --> 18:43.243
well, that can destroy the body,
the mind... It can destroy anything.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.714
<i>Even a relationship.</i>

18:45.927 --> 18:48.885
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Oh, God, yes.

18:54.352 --> 18:57.424
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Action Air, flight 65.</i>

18:57.689 --> 19:00.328
<i>Non-stop service
to Tacoma, Washington.</i>

19:02.444 --> 19:06.437
- Kim, wait!
- J. D?

19:12.912 --> 19:14.345
I couldn't let you leave
without you knowing

19:14.539 --> 19:16.018
I completely support your decision.

19:16.207 --> 19:17.686
Oh, J. D!

19:21.463 --> 19:26.059
Now, let's get that shirt off.
There they are.

19:31.348 --> 19:34.226
So, then everyone watches us do it
and claps after?

19:34.643 --> 19:37.077
- The end.
- Sweet story.

19:37.437 --> 19:41.271
I'm sorry. I was such an idiot.
I just... I'm really gonna miss you.

19:42.484 --> 19:43.803
Look, we're gonna talk every night,

19:43.985 --> 19:45.100
we're gonna get you
a hands-free headset

19:45.278 --> 19:47.394
for phone sex
and we're gonna get through it.

19:48.114 --> 19:49.593
Oh, God, I'm gonna be
so big when I get back,

19:49.783 --> 19:51.341
you're not going to want to touch me.

19:51.534 --> 19:54.970
Don't be ridiculous.
I've been with a lot of big girls.

19:55.246 --> 19:56.599
Oh, yeah?

19:57.707 --> 20:00.858
<i>The best part of a great mystery
is its resolution.</i>

20:03.088 --> 20:05.727
<i>Whether you finally realised
what your friend was looking for...</i>

20:05.966 --> 20:09.675
- So, tell me about your new job.
- It's amazing.

20:10.637 --> 20:13.105
<i>...or just figuring out
why a guy was orange.</i>

20:13.348 --> 20:15.464
Am I ever going to look normal again?

20:15.684 --> 20:19.313
Oh, sure, sure, as long as you cut
back on your vegetables.

20:19.604 --> 20:22.721
Maybe, I don't know,
buy some clothes from this decade.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.201
Oh, I almost forgot.

20:25.402 --> 20:26.915
Your wife was crying the other night.

20:27.112 --> 20:29.546
Keep an eye out for postpartum
depression. It's pretty serious.

20:29.906 --> 20:33.182
She hasn't seemed sad at all,
but I'll keep an eye out.

20:33.785 --> 20:36.458
<i>Of course, no matter how many
mysteries you solve,</i>

20:36.705 --> 20:38.935
<i>it's always easy to miss one.</i>

20:39.749 --> 20:41.785
Turk, I can't handle
going home right now.

20:42.836 --> 20:44.747
Don't look at me. I wasn't crying.

20:46.339 --> 20:48.899
I just need a break from the baby.

20:52.304 --> 20:54.374
<i>Like who's really in trouble.</i>
