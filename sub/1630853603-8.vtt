WEBVTT

00:03.951 --> 00:07.391
(audience applauding
and cheering)

00:07.424 --> 00:08.661
Welcome back to?

00:08.694 --> 00:09.630
AUDIENCE:
The Bear!

00:09.663 --> 00:10.732
The Bear!

00:10.765 --> 00:12.168
I'm Carmen Berzatto,

00:12.201 --> 00:15.107
and today, we're gonna
be making beef braciole.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.744
Now this is a very special dish

00:16.777 --> 00:19.115
in my dysfunctional
nightmare of a household.

00:19.148 --> 00:21.787
My brother Mike made this
for us every single Sunday.

00:21.820 --> 00:22.655
AUDIENCE:
Aw.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.495
And, you guys,
this is a cute story.

00:25.528 --> 00:29.302
My brother, who was
addicted to painkillers,

00:29.335 --> 00:32.576
blew his head off
on the State Street bridge.

00:32.609 --> 00:33.511
Bam!

00:33.544 --> 00:35.414
AUDIENCE:
Oh...

00:35.447 --> 00:37.318
Now, hold on, it gets better.

00:37.351 --> 00:40.625
No letter, no goodbye, nothing.

00:40.658 --> 00:42.295
Except he did leave me

00:42.328 --> 00:43.831
our family's restaurant
in his will,

00:43.864 --> 00:45.334
which was a nice curveball

00:45.367 --> 00:47.338
considering he never let
me work there with him,

00:47.371 --> 00:48.439
even though I'm...

00:49.475 --> 00:51.379
pretty good at this, right?

00:51.412 --> 00:53.149
(audience cheering)

00:55.420 --> 00:59.295
Uh, I used to run
the best restaurant
on the planet Earth.

00:59.328 --> 01:01.132
It was pretty different
from my brother's shithole,

01:01.165 --> 01:03.771
which is barely
hanging on by a thread.

01:03.804 --> 01:05.875
So that was a nice
final "fuck you"

01:05.908 --> 01:07.278
from Michael on the way out.

01:07.311 --> 01:08.848
(audience applauding)

01:08.881 --> 01:11.385
Anyway, braciole.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.391
(audience gasps)

01:15.160 --> 01:16.329
The fuck?

01:18.734 --> 01:19.669
Guys?

01:20.905 --> 01:21.907
Where's my stuff?

01:21.940 --> 01:23.877
(audience laughing)

01:27.484 --> 01:29.689
(laughing continues)

01:32.762 --> 01:34.733
(slams counter)

01:34.766 --> 01:36.302
(laughing continues)

01:36.335 --> 01:38.340
The fuck is going on?

01:38.373 --> 01:40.176
(laughing continues)

01:41.379 --> 01:42.616
Fuck!

01:42.649 --> 01:43.818
Shit!

01:43.851 --> 01:44.720
Mike!

01:44.753 --> 01:46.590
(Mike laughing)

01:46.623 --> 01:49.596
I'm sorry, guys,
I'm sorry. Um...

01:49.629 --> 01:51.867
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm really--
I'm just fucking this up, guys.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.270
I'm fucking this up.
Stop, please.

01:53.303 --> 01:54.438
-It's--
-(beep)

01:56.309 --> 01:57.311
I'm fucking this up.

01:57.344 --> 01:58.514
MICHAEL:
I'm right here.

02:00.818 --> 02:02.689
I can't do this.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.727
Guys, I can't do this!

02:04.760 --> 02:07.733
Stop! I can't, I can't do this!

02:07.766 --> 02:09.268
(beeping)

02:10.470 --> 02:11.741
(ominous music plays)

02:11.774 --> 02:14.613
(audience applauding)

02:14.646 --> 02:15.881
MICHAEL:
You know (inaudible).

02:17.552 --> 02:18.788
-(heavy breathing)
-(cell phone buzzes)

02:18.821 --> 02:20.156
I'm right here.

02:26.335 --> 02:28.741
Hey, Carm, hey,
can you hear me?

02:28.774 --> 02:29.910
(horn blares)

02:29.943 --> 02:32.783
Get the fuck off
my expo, Chef, now!

02:32.816 --> 02:34.586
Get the fuck off!

02:34.619 --> 02:36.791
MICHAEL:
Come on, you're better
than this place.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.159
You're better.

02:45.842 --> 02:47.912
I wanna set this place
on fuckin' fire.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.887
Why are you--

02:51.920 --> 02:54.693
MICHAEL:
Hey, Bear... let it rip.

02:54.726 --> 02:56.964
(indistinct chatter on TV)

02:56.997 --> 02:58.333
I got you, Car.

02:58.366 --> 02:59.803
(chatter continues)

03:05.681 --> 03:07.251
Would anyone that's been to

03:07.284 --> 03:09.421
fewer than 15 meetings
like to speak?

03:12.394 --> 03:13.296
(Carmy clears throat)

03:33.871 --> 03:34.939
My name's Carmen.

03:36.309 --> 03:37.410
My, um...

03:38.914 --> 03:39.817
my brother's an addict.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.318
My, My brother was an addict.

03:45.962 --> 03:47.598
And this morning, I, um--

03:52.609 --> 03:54.813
Sorry, uh...

03:54.846 --> 03:59.388
I forgot, um--
B-Before I came to Al-Anon,
I was a cook.

03:59.421 --> 04:00.658
I mean, I'm-I'm still a cook,

04:00.691 --> 04:02.762
I'm just a different
kind of cook, I guess.

04:09.408 --> 04:11.412
My brother and I,
we would cook a lot together,

04:11.445 --> 04:13.818
especially when we were kids.

04:13.851 --> 04:16.857
You know, that's-that's
when we were closest.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.961
Food was always
our common ground.

04:22.334 --> 04:23.905
We wanted to open
a restaurant together.

04:23.938 --> 04:27.043
Um, we had a name,
we had a vibe, all of it.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.360
My brother could make you
feel confident in yourself.

04:37.899 --> 04:39.603
You know, like, when I
was a kid, if I was nervous,

04:39.636 --> 04:41.105
I was scared,
I wouldn't wanna do something,

04:41.138 --> 04:43.410
he'd always tell me
to just face it.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.048
You know, get it over with.
He would always say, um--

04:47.451 --> 04:49.488
Stupid, he would
always say, um...

04:51.359 --> 04:52.427
"Let it rip."

04:56.937 --> 04:57.972
He was loud.

04:59.609 --> 05:00.744
And he was hilarious.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.786
And he had this amazing ability.

05:04.819 --> 05:06.657
He could just,
he could walk into a room,

05:06.690 --> 05:08.393
and he could take
the temperature of it instantly.

05:08.426 --> 05:09.796
You know, he could just,
he could dial it.

05:12.669 --> 05:13.704
And, um...

05:16.710 --> 05:18.046
I'm not built like that, man.

05:18.079 --> 05:19.047
I, um...

05:21.118 --> 05:22.822
I didn't have a lot
of friends growing up.

05:24.659 --> 05:26.095
I had a, a stutter
when I was a kid.

05:26.128 --> 05:28.501
I was scared
to speak half the time.

05:28.534 --> 05:31.372
And, uh, I got shitty grades

05:31.405 --> 05:32.709
'cause I couldn't
pay attention in school.

05:32.742 --> 05:33.878
I didn't get into college.

05:33.911 --> 05:34.880
I didn't have any girlfriends.

05:34.913 --> 05:35.981
I don't think I'm funny.

05:44.599 --> 05:47.639
I always thought my brother
was my best friend.

05:47.672 --> 05:49.776
Like, Like, we just knew
everything about each other.

05:54.118 --> 05:55.019
Except...

05:56.890 --> 05:58.761
everybody thought
he was their best friend.

05:58.794 --> 06:00.531
You know, he was that,
he was that magnetic.

06:01.165 --> 06:02.400
And, um...

06:09.883 --> 06:11.853
I didn't know my brother
was using drugs.

06:16.128 --> 06:17.430
What does that say?

06:21.707 --> 06:23.109
As we got older, I-I realized

06:23.142 --> 06:24.612
I didn't know
anything about him...

06:25.681 --> 06:26.650
really.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.629
He stopped letting me
into the restaurant

06:32.662 --> 06:33.897
a couple years ago.

06:34.966 --> 06:36.670
He just cut me off cold.

06:36.703 --> 06:37.805
And that, um...

06:39.676 --> 06:41.078
that hurt, you know.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.722
And I think that just,
that flipped a switch in me

06:45.755 --> 06:49.161
where I was like,
"Okay, fuck you, watch this."

06:51.600 --> 06:53.637
And because we had
this connection through food

06:53.670 --> 06:56.710
and he had made me feel
so rejected and lame

06:56.743 --> 06:58.581
and shitty and uncool,

06:58.614 --> 07:00.083
I-I made this plan where
I was gonna go work

07:00.116 --> 07:02.121
in all the best
restaurants
in the world.

07:02.154 --> 07:04.493
You know, like, like, I'm gonna
go work in real kitchens.

07:04.526 --> 07:06.663
Like, fuck Mom and Dad's
piece of shit, right?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.243
And it sounds ridiculous,
you know, me saying that now,

07:13.276 --> 07:15.046
but that's-that's-that's
what I did.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.058
And I got the shit
kicked outta me.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.768
And I separated herbs
and I shucked oysters

07:25.801 --> 07:28.674
and clams and uni.

07:28.707 --> 07:32.114
And I cut myself,
and I got garlic and onions

07:32.147 --> 07:34.051
and peppers in my fingernails
and in my eyes,

07:34.084 --> 07:36.824
and my skin was dry
and oily at the same time.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.861
I had calluses
on my fingers
from the knives,

07:38.894 --> 07:41.098
and my stomach was fucked,
and it was...

07:42.100 --> 07:43.069
everything.

07:49.883 --> 07:51.587
And a couple years later,
this funny thing happened

07:51.620 --> 07:52.521
which is like...

07:53.824 --> 07:54.960
for the first time in my life

07:54.993 --> 07:57.932
I-I started to find this,
uh, this station for myself.

08:03.342 --> 08:06.149
And I was fast. I wasn't afraid.

08:06.182 --> 08:08.119
And it was clear,
and I-I felt...

08:10.891 --> 08:12.561
I felt okay, you know.

08:17.939 --> 08:19.275
I knew which vegetables
went together,

08:19.308 --> 08:21.880
proteins, temperature,
sauces, all that shit.

08:21.913 --> 08:24.251
And when somebody new came
into the restaurant to stage,

08:24.284 --> 08:25.955
I'd look at them like
they were competition,

08:25.988 --> 08:27.792
like I'm gonna smoke
this motherfucker.

08:32.602 --> 08:34.171
I felt like I could
speak through the food,

08:34.204 --> 08:36.944
like I could communicate
through creativity.

08:36.977 --> 08:38.948
And that kind of
confidence, you know,

08:38.981 --> 08:41.854
like I was finally--
I wa-- I was good at something,
that was so new,

08:41.887 --> 08:43.757
and that was so exciting
and I just wanted him

08:43.790 --> 08:45.293
to know that and, fuck,
I just wanted him

08:45.326 --> 08:47.230
to be like, "Good job!"

08:54.244 --> 08:55.882
And the more he
wouldn't respond,

08:55.915 --> 08:57.685
and the more our relationship...

08:58.754 --> 09:00.958
kinda strained,

09:00.991 --> 09:03.062
the deeper into this I went
and the better I got.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.209
And the more people I cut out,
the quieter my life got.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.117
And the routine
of the kitchen was so...

09:15.955 --> 09:19.629
consistent and exacting and busy

09:19.662 --> 09:21.232
and hard and alive,

09:21.265 --> 09:23.570
and I lost track
of time and he died.

09:29.281 --> 09:30.717
And he left me his restaurant.

09:34.926 --> 09:39.335
And over the last couple months
I-I've been trying to fix it

09:39.368 --> 09:41.740
'cause it was in rough shape,
and I think it's very clear

09:41.773 --> 09:45.247
that me trying to fix
the restaurant...

09:45.280 --> 09:49.221
was me trying to fix whatever
was happening with my brother.

09:49.254 --> 09:51.960
And I don't know, maybe fix
the whole family because...

09:54.231 --> 09:57.137
that restaurant,
it has and it, it does mean

09:57.170 --> 09:58.272
a lot to people.

10:04.218 --> 10:05.319
It means a lot to me.

10:11.131 --> 10:13.002
I just don't know if it
ever meant anything to him.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.649
(upbeat music playing)

10:25.093 --> 10:26.997
Anything from Marcus yet?

10:27.030 --> 10:28.065
No, Jeff.

10:28.099 --> 10:31.205
For real, she just missed
my asshole, you know.

10:31.238 --> 10:34.278
Like, what happens if you get
stabbed in the asshole?

10:34.311 --> 10:36.950
You can't sew an asshole.

10:36.983 --> 10:38.386
-EBRAHEIM: I've sewn asshole.
-RICHIE: Whose?

10:38.419 --> 10:39.556
EBRAHEIM:
A close friend.

10:39.589 --> 10:43.329
Chefs, yo, let's bring it
in for pre-service, please.

10:43.362 --> 10:44.833
Yes, Chef.

10:44.866 --> 10:46.970
CARMY:
Everybody, come on out.

10:47.003 --> 10:50.143
Uh, okay, look, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

10:50.176 --> 10:52.815
but we are gonna be closed
for dinner service tonight

10:52.848 --> 10:56.122
'cause we are having
a bachelor party in the front.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.357
-Fuck that!
-CARMY: I know.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.030
I know.
It's Cicero's friends, so...

11:00.063 --> 11:01.867
-Yo, Cousin.
-That sucks, Jeff.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.236
I was just getting
into the zone.

11:03.269 --> 11:04.739
No, I know. I get it.

11:04.772 --> 11:06.710
But, uh, it's just
for the night.

11:06.743 --> 11:08.179
We're still gonna
rock lunch, alright?

11:08.212 --> 11:09.481
I'll run point
out front tonight

11:09.515 --> 11:10.985
in case I gotta use
the big boy voice.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.287
I think we'll be fine,
thank you.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.323
Bro, you can never tell

11:13.356 --> 11:14.926
with these
white-collar criminals.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.797
-Carmen, how many people?
-CARMY: How many people?

11:16.830 --> 11:19.401
Um, I'm not sure, but, uh, we're
gonna try to keep it chill.

11:19.434 --> 11:21.038
They're gonna bring
their own booze.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.875
We're gonna have
snacks, small plates

11:22.908 --> 11:23.977
moving right through, okay?

11:24.010 --> 11:25.280
-TINA: Alright, yes, Chef.
-EBRAHEIM: Thanks, Chef.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.381
Thank you, Chefs.

11:33.062 --> 11:34.899
(soft jazz music playing)Okay, I see you.

11:34.932 --> 11:35.968
You see me?

11:36.001 --> 11:38.305
Yeah, combining ingredients.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.243
Yeah.

11:40.276 --> 11:42.715
Just take the compliment. Jeez.

11:44.384 --> 11:47.257
Now I see you adding
salt and everything.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.894
-No--
-You're outta control.

11:48.927 --> 11:50.096
Yeah.

11:50.129 --> 11:52.034
That's cool.
You didn't even take a day off.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.806
Uh, I don't know about cool.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.344
I feel like, uh,
I'm just the type, like,

11:57.377 --> 11:59.515
as soon as I stop, I...

12:00.551 --> 12:01.452
(imitates explosion sound)

12:01.485 --> 12:02.522
You know?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.258
Yeah, I feel that.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.393
My dad's like that.

12:07.898 --> 12:10.436
Yeah, my, uh,
my mom's like that.

12:14.177 --> 12:19.054
I, um, I feel kinda bad
'cause I feel like

12:19.087 --> 12:23.831
I haven't really like
asked you how you're doing,

12:23.864 --> 12:28.139
um, with everything
since, you know.

12:28.172 --> 12:31.178
Yeah. I mean, I feel okay.

12:32.013 --> 12:33.416
Better.

12:33.449 --> 12:36.222
You know, my head just got
real fucked up for a minute.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.794
I mean, welcome to the club.

12:38.827 --> 12:40.063
Is that not weird, though?

12:40.096 --> 12:42.367
Dude, it would be weird
to work in a restaurant

12:42.400 --> 12:44.004
and not completely
lose your mind.

12:44.839 --> 12:45.941
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

12:48.914 --> 12:51.185
Mm. It's good?

12:51.218 --> 12:53.322
SYDNEY:
I mean, we're
about to find out.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.926
So what is this?

12:54.959 --> 12:59.001
This is, uh, Chilean sea bass.

12:59.034 --> 13:01.405
We got a little...

13:01.438 --> 13:06.415
(inaudible)-inspired,
uh, tomato confit.

13:06.448 --> 13:09.254
Then, uh, I don't know, herbs,

13:09.287 --> 13:11.893
'cause... fuck it.

13:11.926 --> 13:13.196
MARCUS:
You know, why the fuck not?

13:13.229 --> 13:14.599
SYDNEY:
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

13:14.632 --> 13:16.068
MARCUS:
Yeah.

13:16.101 --> 13:18.239
So, have you like,

13:18.272 --> 13:20.544
eaten at all these people
that you studied?

13:20.577 --> 13:23.182
Oh, man, when
I was at the CIA,

13:23.215 --> 13:26.355
the, um, the
Culinary Institute of America,

13:26.388 --> 13:28.494
not the, you know, CIA--

13:28.527 --> 13:30.029
Yeah, thanks
for clearing that up.

13:30.062 --> 13:31.098
Yeah, I thought you were a spy.

13:31.131 --> 13:33.002
I could do a regime change

13:33.035 --> 13:34.338
if I really felt like it.

13:34.371 --> 13:36.543
A chef by day,
a CIA agent by night?

13:36.576 --> 13:39.148
Okay, it's--
Crazier things have happened.

13:39.181 --> 13:41.252
-Your coordination, though.
-Hey!

13:41.285 --> 13:43.122
What do you mean, hey?
You spilled veal stock.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.926
I've seen you in action,
I'm just saying--

13:44.959 --> 13:48.132
I invite you into my home
and this is how you treat me?

13:48.165 --> 13:51.606
You, You reward me
with memories
for cooking for you?

13:51.639 --> 13:55.280
Anyway, when I was at the CIA,

13:55.313 --> 13:58.921
I felt like the biggest
idiot on the planet

13:58.954 --> 14:01.225
because I didn't know
half of the people

14:01.258 --> 14:04.364
that anyone was
talking about, and...

14:04.397 --> 14:09.208
I was also so, so broke
when I was there.

14:09.241 --> 14:12.180
And the moment
the semester finished,

14:12.213 --> 14:14.619
I bought a one-way ticket
to New York

14:14.652 --> 14:18.392
and I spent every
single dollar I had,

14:18.425 --> 14:21.666
every last penny, just eating.

14:21.699 --> 14:24.304
Every single place
that I could think of.

14:24.337 --> 14:29.314
And one of those places
was the best meal I ever had.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.085
MARCUS:
That's so tight.

14:31.118 --> 14:32.487
So what was the best one?

14:32.521 --> 14:36.294
Wait one second,
because I forgot...

14:37.565 --> 14:38.900
this.

14:41.371 --> 14:42.941
-Get ready for this.
-Mm-hmm.

14:43.475 --> 14:45.013
Wow, yeah.

14:45.046 --> 14:46.516
SYDNEY:
I had a chef who...

14:47.751 --> 14:51.425
would only let me zest.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.628
-Mm-hmm.
-That was it.

14:52.661 --> 14:56.335
I worked at the place
for like, eight months,

14:56.368 --> 14:57.939
and all I did was zest.

14:57.972 --> 14:59.208
Oh, that's normal.

14:59.241 --> 15:00.243
So normal.

15:00.276 --> 15:01.244
Yeah.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.604
Wow.

15:13.637 --> 15:16.141
This is really,
really, really good.

15:18.112 --> 15:19.113
Thank you.

15:25.994 --> 15:26.963
Nope.

15:30.537 --> 15:32.374
Fuck, Mikey.

15:32.407 --> 15:35.079
(footsteps approaching)

15:35.112 --> 15:37.685
-(knock on door)
-TINA: Yo, Jeff.

15:37.718 --> 15:39.020
Yo. What's up, T?

15:40.223 --> 15:41.660
Jeff?

15:41.693 --> 15:42.661
Yeah?

15:43.362 --> 15:44.430
You good?

15:46.168 --> 15:47.069
Yeah.

15:48.439 --> 15:50.143
Yeah, why?

15:50.176 --> 15:51.713
TINA:
Hmm.

15:51.746 --> 15:54.752
No. You're not as
annoying as usual.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.493
I'm just, uh, tired, I think.

15:58.526 --> 15:59.662
TINA:
Heard.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.574
You're dressed like Syd.

16:05.607 --> 16:08.412
Hmm.
Like a profesh?

16:08.445 --> 16:10.049
Yeah.

16:10.082 --> 16:12.554
-CARMY: I like it.
-I like it, too.

16:16.295 --> 16:17.698
Hey, T, you don't know
anything about, uh,

16:17.731 --> 16:19.769
KBL Electric, do you?

16:19.802 --> 16:22.575
Mikey never mentioned
anything about that to you?

16:22.608 --> 16:24.745
(scoffs) Who the fuck knows?

16:25.714 --> 16:26.682
That kid?

16:27.818 --> 16:29.153
Marone.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.358
Marone.

16:32.260 --> 16:34.197
TINA:
What's it for?

16:34.230 --> 16:36.402
CARMY:
I don't know.

16:36.435 --> 16:40.043
He was paying these
big pieces out every month.

16:40.076 --> 16:42.447
Adds up to the amount
that Cicero loaned him.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.616
How much was the loan?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.056
CARMY:
It's a lot.

16:48.693 --> 16:51.499
That's a lotta bachelor parties
to pay it back, huh?

16:52.333 --> 16:53.468
Yes, Chef.

16:55.106 --> 16:57.277
Why didn't he just
pay the vendors?

16:57.310 --> 16:59.381
TINA:
I don't know, Carm.

16:59.414 --> 17:03.489
I remember there was one month
we didn't have napkins.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.426
He wasn't paying them on time.

17:05.459 --> 17:09.368
I was like, "Mikey, pay these
motherfuckers. We need napkins."

17:09.401 --> 17:12.842
And he was like,
"What's the point?

17:12.875 --> 17:15.647
We not gonna be able to pay
'em next month anyways."

17:16.783 --> 17:18.787
Hmm.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.791
Sounds like that was
his attitude, huh?

17:20.824 --> 17:22.728
(sighs) No, no.

17:22.761 --> 17:25.366
I remember it because
it wasn't his attitude.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.818
Hey, Tina, you go ahead,
you take the night off, okay?

17:35.854 --> 17:37.424
I got you.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.493
TINA:
Thanks.

17:40.564 --> 17:41.632
Yo, Jeff?

17:44.605 --> 17:47.711
You know how much
I loved him, right?

17:50.917 --> 17:52.153
How much?

17:53.857 --> 17:54.825
A lot.

17:56.496 --> 17:57.764
I loved him a lot.

18:00.737 --> 18:02.106
Thanks, Jeff.

18:18.172 --> 18:22.615
I, um, I had some
of your donut the other day.

18:22.648 --> 18:25.319
-Off the floor?
-Yeah, off the floor.

18:25.352 --> 18:26.288
Gary keeps it clean.

18:26.321 --> 18:27.490
No, I don't wanna hear--

18:27.524 --> 18:28.527
That's not a good excuse.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.398
Listen, the man works hard.

18:31.431 --> 18:32.902
Well, so what'd you think?

18:32.935 --> 18:36.275
It was, It was really good.

18:36.308 --> 18:40.283
-It was really, really good.
-Hmm.

18:40.316 --> 18:43.189
And I'm really sorry

18:43.222 --> 18:47.197
that Carmy destroyed it
like a little bitch.

18:47.230 --> 18:51.205
That's exactly what he did.
He destroyed it like a bitch.

18:51.238 --> 18:52.808
-Little bitch.
-Little small bitch.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.743
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

18:57.483 --> 19:01.157
Have you, um, have you
talked to him yet, or--

19:01.759 --> 19:03.362
No.

19:03.395 --> 19:07.705
I'm gonna go back,
and we'll hash it out, I guess.

19:07.738 --> 19:10.276
Or maybe not,
and that's just how it is,

19:10.309 --> 19:12.447
"Thank you, Chef,
may I have another?"

19:12.480 --> 19:15.754
Yeah, there is
no right answer.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.291
You gonna go back to UPS?

19:19.829 --> 19:22.200
UPS is the crazy shit
that made me

19:22.233 --> 19:25.439
wanna do this crazy shit,
so, probably not.

19:27.343 --> 19:29.515
We didn't really like
eat out a lot growing up,

19:29.548 --> 19:34.525
so when we did, it felt special
even if it wasn't.

19:34.558 --> 19:35.794
-MARCUS: Mm-hmm.
-I don't know.

19:35.827 --> 19:37.865
Yeah, I mean,
my family
was the same.

19:37.898 --> 19:40.904
Like, for my cousin
Terrell's graduation,

19:40.937 --> 19:43.008
we went
to Michael Jordan's
steakhouse.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.379
-Okay, and?
-What do you mean, and?

19:45.412 --> 19:46.549
It's the best
restaurant on Earth.

19:46.582 --> 19:47.751
-What do you mean?
-The bacon?

19:47.784 --> 19:50.591
Yes, yes, exactly,
you understand, yeah.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.795
It's the best bacon.

19:52.828 --> 19:55.701
That's what
I wanna do, though.
I wanna...

19:55.734 --> 19:59.909
I wanna cook for people
and make them happy

19:59.942 --> 20:04.552
and give them
the best bacon on Earth.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.923
Well, even though that spot
is, is taken, actually.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.958
Second-best is cool.

20:07.991 --> 20:09.394
-That's great.
-Mm-hmm.

20:09.427 --> 20:11.599
-I'd love that.
-MARCUS: Yeah.

20:11.632 --> 20:14.004
So back
to The Beef
then, huh?

20:14.037 --> 20:17.611
I don't know. Knowing me,
I'll just probably...

20:17.644 --> 20:20.316
get a job at another spot.

20:20.349 --> 20:24.525
Another after that,
and I guess just do that forever

20:24.558 --> 20:29.233
until my credit isn't
negative one million.

20:29.635 --> 20:30.703
Uh.

20:32.708 --> 20:33.777
You got a dream spot?

20:33.810 --> 20:35.012
Of course.

20:35.045 --> 20:36.516
MARCUS:
Like what?

20:36.549 --> 20:37.618
I mean, you'll find out
when it's open.

20:37.651 --> 20:38.987
-Okay.
-SYDNEY: Okay.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.323
I like that attitude.

20:40.356 --> 20:41.759
That's how you win.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.563
Yeah, or, or lose everything

20:43.596 --> 20:45.634
and, um, end up
living back with your dad

20:45.667 --> 20:48.271
and his stinky fuckin'
CPAP machine.

20:49.608 --> 20:52.715
But... it was cool
seeing you guys

20:52.748 --> 20:54.619
be good at different things,
you and Carmen,

20:54.652 --> 20:55.753
and I learned a lot from y'all.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.524
Hmm.

20:58.993 --> 21:00.730
Wait, so what was the best one?

21:01.464 --> 21:02.668
Best what?

21:02.701 --> 21:03.870
Best meal you ever had.

21:07.410 --> 21:08.813
Yeah, it was, it was Carmy's.

21:08.846 --> 21:11.351
-I knew it. I knew it, yeah.
-SYDNEY: Hmm.

21:13.422 --> 21:15.994
He is really, really...

21:17.396 --> 21:18.398
really good.

21:20.469 --> 21:21.539
High praise.

21:23.643 --> 21:26.415
Yeah, but he's
still a little bitch.

21:26.448 --> 21:27.383
Yeah.

21:28.686 --> 21:29.755
I won't disagree.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.896
(electronic music playing)

21:37.504 --> 21:38.906
(cheering)

21:40.777 --> 21:42.413
Fuckin' asshole.

21:44.818 --> 21:46.756
I'm standing right
here doing nothing.

21:46.789 --> 21:49.661
Not you, your fuckin' brother.

21:52.701 --> 21:54.839
This is a fucking
disgrace right here.

21:54.872 --> 21:56.775
(music continues)

22:06.394 --> 22:07.363
Addicts.

22:09.935 --> 22:12.708
They, They say some shit like
they gotta help themselves,

22:12.741 --> 22:15.647
but I should've
fuckin' handcuffed

22:15.680 --> 22:17.383
that motherfucker to the desk.

22:18.586 --> 22:20.489
You knew he was using?

22:20.523 --> 22:21.659
How could you not?

22:23.997 --> 22:25.466
Because I never
fuckin' saw him,

22:25.500 --> 22:26.736
I never fuckin' talked to him.

22:26.769 --> 22:27.905
He wouldn't take my calls.

22:27.938 --> 22:29.473
He wouldn't let me
work in the restaurant.

22:30.677 --> 22:31.779
I should've done more.

22:33.650 --> 22:34.518
What could you do?

22:34.551 --> 22:36.120
I don't fuckin' know!

22:40.997 --> 22:42.433
(exhales)

22:45.807 --> 22:47.744
I never thought he was,
would f--

22:50.717 --> 22:52.554
You know, he was so loud and...

22:53.956 --> 22:56.127
obnoxious and fuckin'...

22:57.898 --> 22:59.034
hilarious.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.069
You know, he was Mikey Bear.

23:00.102 --> 23:01.706
I thought...

23:01.739 --> 23:03.041
he would pull out of it.

23:07.651 --> 23:09.888
(rattling and pounding)

23:13.128 --> 23:16.167
What the fuck?
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

23:17.738 --> 23:18.873
(groans)

23:19.908 --> 23:21.078
(grunting)

23:21.111 --> 23:23.082
CARMY:
Hey, get the fuck--

23:23.115 --> 23:24.719
RICHIE:
That's enough!

23:24.752 --> 23:26.487
That's fuckin' enough!

23:27.691 --> 23:29.460
Enough! Enough!

23:30.897 --> 23:31.866
(groaning)

23:31.899 --> 23:34.070
(slow techno music playing)

23:37.009 --> 23:37.878
Yo.

23:37.911 --> 23:39.715
(music continues)

23:51.706 --> 23:52.674
Fuck.

23:55.647 --> 23:57.182
-(cell doors close)
-(buzzer buzzes)

24:11.579 --> 24:13.248
Any word?

the minute he wakes up.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.528
But he's still in the ICU?

24:19.561 --> 24:20.530
GUARD:
Correct.

24:23.970 --> 24:26.809
Uh, what, what happens
if he doesn't wake up?

24:26.842 --> 24:28.278
He better wake up.

24:28.311 --> 24:32.053
But I'm saying,
what happens if he doesn't?

24:32.086 --> 24:33.956
You'll be looking
at manslaughter.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.709
Hold on. Guard? Sir?

24:44.611 --> 24:46.080
Sir? Officer?

(chuckles)

25:29.735 --> 25:33.075
I'm just getting off work.
It's been a crazy day.

25:33.108 --> 25:34.611
All good, though. Um...

you know, I was just...

25:37.149 --> 25:38.251
(exhales)

25:40.957 --> 25:42.661
I was just thinking

25:42.694 --> 25:44.330

25:45.265 --> 25:46.668

what I called him.

25:51.244 --> 25:52.580
And, uh...

25:56.087 --> 25:57.356
you were right, you know.

25:58.893 --> 26:00.128
That was not okay.

26:00.997 --> 26:02.099

26:06.775 --> 26:08.078
I'm sorry.

26:08.111 --> 26:09.681
Uh... (clears throat)

26:12.186 --> 26:14.692
um, you know,
that's pretty much it.

26:14.725 --> 26:15.726
Um...

26:18.733 --> 26:22.774

Give Eva a big hug.

26:22.807 --> 26:26.782

This is not respect.

30:48.004 --> 30:49.574

Of course, I do, Neil.
But I don't talk about it.

I keep it all inside.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.958
