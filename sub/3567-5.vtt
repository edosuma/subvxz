<b>1x05 - "Frybo" </b>

00:28.503 --> 00:31.894
Where are you?

00:31.896 --> 00:36.249
- You're a mess, Steven.
- I know I had eight.

00:36.251 --> 00:39.468
Hey, Steven, have you
seen a gem shard anywhere?

00:39.470 --> 00:42.171
- It's very important.
- No.

00:42.173 --> 00:46.275
Have you seen my pants?
They're also very important.

00:46.277 --> 00:49.178
I'm serious, Steven.
These shards have a powerful

00:49.180 --> 00:51.781
partial consciousness that has
been harnessed by gems

00:51.783 --> 00:53.716
throughout history
in order top create...

00:53.718 --> 00:56.118
<i>They weren't in the kitchen, either.</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:58.020
<i>Under the bed!
No, wait.</i>

00:58.022 --> 01:01.190
<i>I looked there, too.
And then Pearl walked in...</i>

01:01.192 --> 01:02.892
<i>Pearl!</i>

01:02.894 --> 01:04.610
...waned as the shards...

01:04.611 --> 01:06.646
<i>Oh, geez.
She's really explaining</i>

01:06.648 --> 01:08.781
<i>something.
I can't just start</i>

01:08.783 --> 01:13.129
<i>listening now. I'd be lost.
Just like my pants.</i>

01:13.130 --> 01:15.270
...could become a monster.

01:15.272 --> 01:17.406
That's why it's very, very important

01:17.408 --> 01:22.845
that it's kept away
from any kind of garment.

01:22.847 --> 01:25.548
If you see it, bring it to me
right away.

01:25.550 --> 01:31.821
- I'm going to check in town.
- For my pants?!

01:31.823 --> 01:37.143
I guess I'll keep looking here.
That's unusual!

01:38.641 --> 01:41.630
Come on!
We used to be friends!

01:41.632 --> 01:44.600
We used to go everywhere together!

01:44.502 --> 01:46.702
Whoo!

01:46.704 --> 01:49.639
Got you now, pants!

01:49.641 --> 01:53.521
Hyah!
I wear the pants in this relationship.

01:53.522 --> 01:55.711
What's gotten into you?

01:55.713 --> 01:59.048
Hmm?
Oh!

01:59.050 --> 02:04.270
It's a... thingy.
Is this Pearl's shard thingy?

02:04.272 --> 02:05.534
Whoa!

02:08.911 --> 02:10.886
Ha! Now who's smart?

02:10.887 --> 02:12.862
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:12.864 --> 02:15.998
Stop! Oh.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.036
Thanks.
I got to get you to Pearl.

02:21.631 --> 02:24.874
<i>Hey, Pearl! Pearl!</i>

02:24.876 --> 02:28.344
She must still be looking for my pants.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.880
<i>Please help me!
No! Get them away!</i>

02:36.120 --> 02:38.354
I'm not fries!

02:43.227 --> 02:45.595
Ah, where's your face, Frybo?

02:45.596 --> 02:50.567
Being part of the Fryman family
means you got to sell fries.

02:50.568 --> 02:53.169
And be my son, which you are.

02:53.171 --> 02:58.574
So, you're already
halfway there. Keep at it, Frybo.

02:58.576 --> 03:03.212
- I'm Pete... y.
- Hi, Petey!

03:03.214 --> 03:06.832
When I told my Dad I wanted
to be part of the Fryman family

03:06.834 --> 03:09.952
business, I didn't think it
meant being stuck in a sweaty

03:09.954 --> 03:13.169
old costume.
Things used to be different, Steven.

03:13.204 --> 03:15.057
Nothing to worry about back then

03:15.059 --> 03:17.960
except making myself
dizzy on the old seahorse

03:17.962 --> 03:21.760
- ride at funland.
- Oh, Frybo, you're hilarious.

03:24.352 --> 03:28.470
I wish there was a way for
this costume to do its job

03:28.472 --> 03:29.923
without me in it.

03:31.276 --> 03:33.642
Maybe it can, Petey.

03:33.644 --> 03:37.322
Maybe it can.

Mnh! Mnh!
Shoo, shoo!

04:04.956 --> 04:06.625
Whoa.

04:10.717 --> 04:15.517
- Stop!
- Unbelievable!

04:15.519 --> 04:21.312
- Get up!
- Do a little dance.

04:28.766 --> 04:31.751
<i>Whoa! All right!</i>

04:31.753 --> 04:35.686
Well, it's about ti...
I mean, good job, buddy!

04:35.840 --> 04:38.307
<i>That's what I'm talking about, Frybo.</i>

04:38.309 --> 04:41.854
Keep it up!

04:42.096 --> 04:44.880
Eee! I'm free!

04:44.882 --> 04:50.236
You got the job, Frybo!
Let's shake on it.

04:50.238 --> 04:53.239
Br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br!

04:53.241 --> 04:57.243
- He's got jokes!
- Okay. No more shaking.

04:57.245 --> 04:59.578
Put me down!

04:59.580 --> 05:05.067
Just go make people eat fries.
Ha ha ha!

05:05.069 --> 05:07.023
Let's go be kids!

05:24.228 --> 05:27.106
This seahorse
used to make me so happy.

05:27.108 --> 05:29.424
Now it's just giving me whiplash.

05:31.370 --> 05:33.548
I feel like there's just no point to it.

05:33.679 --> 05:36.676
- You know what I mean?
- I-I-I just feel

05:36.773 --> 05:40.085
tingl-y-y-y-y-y!

05:40.088 --> 05:41.962
You'll understand when you have a job.

05:42.055 --> 05:45.490
I do have a job.
I protect humanity from magic

05:45.492 --> 05:48.327
- and monsters and stuff.
- I mean a real job that you

05:48.329 --> 05:51.430
- get paid for.
- I'm paid in the smiles

05:51.432 --> 05:54.967
- across the town's faces.
- I don't see anyone smiling.

05:54.969 --> 05:59.405
You pick up a job to buy a
house or raise kids or to...

05:59.407 --> 06:02.808
impress your dad.
You work away your life, and

06:02.810 --> 06:05.577
- what does it get you?
- Smiles and faces?

06:05.579 --> 06:09.314
No. You get cash ...
cash that can't buy back

06:09.316 --> 06:14.486
what the job takes...
Not if you rode every seahorse

06:14.488 --> 06:17.304
in the world.

06:18.259 --> 06:22.661
Whoa.
Wanna try the jellyfish?

06:22.663 --> 06:25.898
That came from the fry shop!

06:37.140 --> 06:38.810
<i>Whoa!</i>

06:40.795 --> 06:44.266
We didn't tell him to do that!
Did we tell him to do that?!

06:51.459 --> 06:53.859
<i>Please!
No more fries!</i>

06:56.447 --> 06:58.597
Frybo, stop!

07:09.105 --> 07:12.578
- I don't even like fries!
- Why isn't he listening?!

07:12.580 --> 07:16.077
- I don't know!
- Petey!

07:16.282 --> 07:20.300
Where's all this coming from?

07:20.335 --> 07:22.174
<i>Aw, I get it.</i>

07:22.298 --> 07:24.528
I pushed you too hard.

07:24.529 --> 07:28.494
I thought you wanted to be as
good a Fryman as you could be.

07:28.495 --> 07:32.165
You're a tough kid for putting
up with it as long as you did.

07:32.166 --> 07:35.585
The truth is, you're a valued
member of Fryman Brothers,

07:35.586 --> 07:39.021
Incorporated, and all its affiliates!

07:40.974 --> 07:44.660
D-a-a-ad!

07:44.662 --> 07:47.994
No!
He'll mash your potatoes!

07:48.404 --> 07:52.551
- What are you gonna do?!
- My job!

07:52.553 --> 07:54.892
<i>Whoa!
Ohh!</i>

07:59.964 --> 08:02.294
<i>Steven!</i>

08:02.296 --> 08:05.497
Did you put my missing
shard in that fry costume?

08:05.499 --> 08:07.832
- Yes!
- Didn't you hear what I

08:07.834 --> 08:10.114
said about the living armor and
infantries and many,

08:10.216 --> 08:12.554
- many deaths?!
- No!

08:12.556 --> 08:14.523
Oh, Steven...

08:24.259 --> 08:27.364
Pearl!

08:29.323 --> 08:32.039
Ugh! The ketchup!
It's everywhere.

08:32.042 --> 08:34.803
- I can't see.
- Shards.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.525
- Need!
- Wha...?

08:37.577 --> 08:40.028
- Steven?
- Dad!

08:49.367 --> 08:50.776
Go away!

08:50.778 --> 08:53.011
- Petey?
- You are awful!

08:53.013 --> 08:55.747
<i>I hate you!
I've always hated you!</i>

08:55.749 --> 08:58.650
Wait.
You've always hated Frybo?

09:08.349 --> 09:11.062
- Steven!
- Where?

09:13.733 --> 09:19.950
Your move... Frybo.

09:20.646 --> 09:22.741
Attack!

09:31.910 --> 09:36.304
I didn't want to do
this, but you leave me no choice.

09:36.379 --> 09:38.257
Underwear ... go!

09:50.915 --> 09:54.070
Steven, are you all right?

09:54.215 --> 09:56.865
- Fine.
- I'm okay.

09:56.979 --> 10:00.887
As soon as I bared my
butt, I knew he'd crack.

10:10.909 --> 10:16.206
You were great, Frybo.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.574
Kids today just didn't understand.

10:18.616 --> 10:21.667
And now...
they never will.

10:21.669 --> 10:24.903
Weren't people scared
of it before he attacked them?

10:24.905 --> 10:30.141
- Shh!
- It's time... to send him off.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.499
As greasy in death as he

10:42.532 --> 10:48.702
- was in life.
- Dad, um... I'll...

10:48.900 --> 10:51.046
are you going to get another costume?

10:52.088 --> 10:58.294
No, I don't need another Frybo.
I've got the Fryman.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.953
Pearl, I think our
work here is done.

11:06.098 --> 11:08.416
