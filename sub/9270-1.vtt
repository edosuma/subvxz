01:43.700 --> 01:45.770
He was that fast,
I thought I was done for.

01:45.820 --> 01:47.690
~ Inspector!
~ No-one's allowed through.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.370
No, Father! This is a crime scene.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.370
But that poor man's soul.
At least let me pray over his body.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.130
If we need your services later,
we'll let you know.

01:56.180 --> 01:59.090
You wouldn't have even found him
if it wasn't for me.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.930
Yes, tell me, what were you doing
trespassing on private land?

02:01.980 --> 02:04.570
We'll let you
carry on with your job.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.940
Mmm.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.530
Oh, don't bother knocking.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.900
Have you seen?

02:24.900 --> 02:26.490
It was no accident.

02:26.540 --> 02:29.050
Don't be ridiculous, Sidney.
It's in the newspaper.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.170
You mean it's what Inspector
Sullivan told the newspaper.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.170
That body was dry as a bone
when I saw it.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.010
Archibald Waterson.
I know that name.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.090
Wasn't he a friend of the Sheppards?

02:38.140 --> 02:40.370
Best man at their wedding last year?

02:40.420 --> 02:43.210
Yes. Yes, I think you may be right.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.570
Why is Sullivan covering this up?

02:45.620 --> 02:47.490
He's not even interviewed me
as a witness.

02:47.540 --> 02:53.380
True. Still, I suppose
it's none of our business.

03:02.740 --> 03:05.250
Mrs Sheppard, I've come
to offer my condolences

03:05.300 --> 03:06.770
on the death of your friend.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.060
That's kind of you. Come in.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.050
Congratulations!

03:13.100 --> 03:14.380
Thank you.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.810
Ah, I've been looking for you.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.290
Must be your lucky day.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.690
I spoke to Alf Turner
at the Red Lion.

03:24.740 --> 03:28.010
He told me about your fanciful
interpretation of what
happened yesterday.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.690
Nothing fanciful about it.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.010
You've got to stop this.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.420
What? It's a free country.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.860
Trust me...

03:38.460 --> 03:39.930
.. don't go making a fuss.

03:39.980 --> 03:43.300
You know me, Inspector.
Soul of discretion.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.210
We're still in shock.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.860
Archie was one of
the finest men I ever met.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.610
Do you know what happened?

04:00.660 --> 04:03.340
Only what we read in the paper -
that he drowned.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.850
I wonder what
he was doing at the lake.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.650
I don't know, it was a warm day.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.860
He probably just wanted to cool off.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.250
Did he live nearby?

04:15.300 --> 04:17.130
Little Haydock.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.329
That's several miles away.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.410
Yes, I don't know what
he was doing around here.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.260
We saw him yesterday morning
at the Manor.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.050
Made plans for the weekend.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.370
He was part of the
restoration project?

04:30.420 --> 04:33.610
Archie specialised in the
conservation of oil paintings.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.850
There must be hundreds
of those at Bridgemore.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.180
Everyone there is going
to miss Archie.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.730
The pair of you most of all.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.820
We barely slept last night.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.700
Well, I've intruded
for far too long.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.450
Once again,
my sincerest condolences.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.180
Thank you.

Of course.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.610
All right, what exactly
are we looking for?

06:13.660 --> 06:15.890
Anything out of the ordinary.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.450
This is where the Sheppards
knew Archie from.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.610
We can learn a great deal about
all three of them from here.

06:21.660 --> 06:22.970
Why are you suspicious?

06:23.020 --> 06:26.810
Because one of them said they
found out about what happened
from the morning's paper,

06:26.860 --> 06:30.300
~ the other one said they
couldn't sleep the previous
night because of it. ~ Ha!

06:32.420 --> 06:35.210
Perhaps they had good reason to lie.

06:35.260 --> 06:39.170
Sullivan isn't treating
this case as routine.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.100
Something else is going on here.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.890
I'll see what I can find.

06:49.940 --> 06:53.450
Assuming His Lordship lets us
into his house in the first place.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.540
Oh, he will. I hope you realise
the sacrifice I'm making.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.650
You know he's a madman?

06:59.700 --> 07:01.370
He's a member of the House of Lords!

Exactly.

Do you play?

07:13.060 --> 07:15.410
I did, I did - but never on carpet.

07:15.460 --> 07:19.210
Ah-ha-ha! It's good to see you,
old girl.

07:19.260 --> 07:21.300
Whoo! Mwah!

07:22.660 --> 07:25.740
Now, please, make yourselves at home.

07:33.100 --> 07:37.450
So, what can I do for you?

07:37.500 --> 07:44.210
Well, Monty and I are holding
a little soiree next Saturday,
you know.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.530
Sounds divine.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.970
I was just passing and I thought
I'd ask you in person.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.290
We'd love it if you could come.

07:51.340 --> 07:55.570

such an offer? Eh? ~ Yeah.

07:57.540 --> 08:00.050
I was sorry to hear what happened,
Lord Masters.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.050
Sorry, what?

08:02.100 --> 08:06.970
The man working on your restoration
project. Archibald Waterson.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.850
Ah! I've been expecting you.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.010
Now, where the hell is the thing?

08:52.860 --> 08:54.890
I found it on my desk this morning.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.730
Archie had left a note with it.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.010
He said an important stranger
would ask about him

09:00.060 --> 09:01.900
and I should give them
this envelope.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.690
Did you know Archie well?

09:04.740 --> 09:05.930
Barely at all.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.940
Those restoration fellows stick to
the far side of the house.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.380
Love letter, is it?

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
"I'll take the secret to my grave."

09:17.340 --> 09:19.730
~ Does that mean anything to you? ~ No.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.740
CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE

09:25.700 --> 09:26.940
Do you know him?

09:29.140 --> 09:30.650
I can't say.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.260
Oh, like that, is it? Eh?

09:44.660 --> 09:46.810
Sorry. Who are you?

09:46.860 --> 09:48.970
Lady Felicia's driver.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.370
Oh.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.850
Are you all right?

09:51.900 --> 09:53.250
Allergies.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.540
Oh.

09:55.660 --> 09:59.570
It's William, isn't it?
I've seen you around Kembleford.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.090
I'm sorry to hear about your mate.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.940
That must be tough for you.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.650
I'm fine. Thank you.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.180
Right.

10:11.580 --> 10:12.780
Right you are.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.570
So, when did the
restoration project start?

10:23.620 --> 10:27.250
My dear, I have people who
remember dates for me.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.690
Would you like some apple crumble?

10:29.740 --> 10:31.090
Roughly.

10:31.140 --> 10:34.690
Er, well, 18 months ago.
Give or take.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.890
How did you find
the people to do it?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.610
I didn't, they found me.

10:38.660 --> 10:42.170
They're a benevolent organisation,
who wanted to help me

10:42.220 --> 10:45.890
preserve my family's
heritage for future generations.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.850
Sticky tart?

10:47.900 --> 10:51.690
No cake, thank you.
How many people work on it?

10:51.740 --> 10:53.090
Well, I don't know.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.850
These restoration fellows,
they keep themselves to themselves

10:55.900 --> 10:58.690
and I rattle around the East Wing.

10:58.740 --> 11:02.130
I suppose about a dozen in total.

11:02.180 --> 11:03.930
That seems a lot.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.570
Well, it's a big house.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.890
No-one's tried to catalogue it
since great Uncle Basil.

11:08.940 --> 11:10.690
HE LAUGHS

11:10.740 --> 11:12.530
What a fruitbat he was.

11:12.580 --> 11:16.090
He organised the heirlooms
in colour order,

11:16.140 --> 11:18.290
according to their aura.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.650
So you don't go over to the
part of the house where they work?

11:21.700 --> 11:23.450
They use dangerous chemicals!

11:23.500 --> 11:26.450
No, they said it was safest for me
to stay clear.

11:26.500 --> 11:31.100
Not that I mind, of course. No,
I'm quite happy here with Terrance.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.650
Terrance?

11:33.700 --> 11:35.220
Oh.

11:36.540 --> 11:37.740
Ah!

11:40.900 --> 11:44.380
Nobody is to touch anything
in this room until I give the word.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.140
You're all to return home and
remain there until I send for you.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.100
Sorry, wrong door.

12:01.580 --> 12:05.810
Now, Cousin George - he set himself
the challenge of translating

12:05.860 --> 12:08.770
every book in the house
into Ancient Greek.

12:08.820 --> 12:12.450
Died tragically with
the finishing line just in sight,

12:12.500 --> 12:16.290
16 books from the end
of the zoology section.

12:16.340 --> 12:18.330
We've taken up too much
of your time.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.530
Oh, not at all.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.210
It's a delight to see you
without old Monty in tow.

12:22.260 --> 12:25.530
Was it he who insisted you be
chaperoned with the priest?

12:25.580 --> 12:28.210
Father Brown is not here
to keep an eye on me.

12:28.260 --> 12:30.490
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

12:30.540 --> 12:33.090
It's been a pleasure.
I look forward to the weekend.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.410
I'm already counting the minutes.
Tick, tock.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.970
Must dash.

12:38.020 --> 12:40.100
Goodbye, Your Lordship. Terrance.

12:42.620 --> 12:45.410
I didn't see nothing.
Honestly, I can keep shtoom.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.490
Take him to the station for now.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.010
Who are you?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.580
You were warned.

12:57.140 --> 12:58.930
Lady Felicia.

12:58.980 --> 13:01.330
What has Sid done?

13:01.380 --> 13:03.130
And you must be Father Brown.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.370
You have the better of me.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.250
What are you doing here, Daniel?

13:07.300 --> 13:09.050
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.490
Please, I'm sure we can
sort this out.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.890
I'll arrange for someone
to give you a lift back to town

13:13.940 --> 13:15.450
while your driver is indisposed.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.340
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have urgent matters to attend to.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.610
Lady Felicia, can you please
explain what's going on?

13:25.660 --> 13:27.490
Who was that man?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.260
His name is Daniel Whittaker.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.570
How do you know him?

13:34.620 --> 13:37.700
We had dealings during the war.

13:38.780 --> 13:40.420
He works for the government.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.650
What part of the government?

13:44.700 --> 13:45.980
MI5.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.860
Wait there.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.250
What now?

14:04.300 --> 14:07.370
I realise there are legal reasons
why you shouldn't talk about this.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.770
I won't abandon Sid.

14:08.820 --> 14:12.130
Good. We need a better idea
about what's really happening.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.290
The restoration project
is just a front.

14:14.340 --> 14:15.970
That's why the Sheppards lied to me.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.850
What do you make of Archie's letter?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.810
"I'll take the secret to my grave."

14:19.860 --> 14:22.730
He must have left it as a safeguard
in case anything happened to him.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.690
~ He knew he was in danger.
~ But why didn't he ask for help?

14:25.740 --> 14:27.250
Why put yourself in harm's way?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.170
Perhaps he was involved
in something illegal?

14:30.220 --> 14:33.410
~ I'll find out more about the
official investigation. ~ Good.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.340
~ Cheerio. ~ Anon, anon. ~ Thank you.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.420
HE SIGHS

14:56.380 --> 14:58.020
Hello, Archie.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.170
Lord Masters, do you think
I might have a quick word?

15:11.220 --> 15:16.180
Oh, hello. Have a seat,
have a nibble.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.140
Excuse my fingers. There you go.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.500
Thank you.

15:26.460 --> 15:31.130
My name is James Gregson, I'm
overseeing the restoration project.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.770
I'm here because a member
of my staff had an unfortunate

15:34.820 --> 15:36.370
accident yesterday.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.210
Oh, yes. Beastly business,

15:38.260 --> 15:43.170
as I was saying to that minx
and her priest earlier.

15:43.220 --> 15:44.970
They were asking about it?

15:45.020 --> 15:48.380
Poor Archie.
He left a letter for them.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.340
Do you know what it said?

15:59.180 --> 16:02.370
You have finally gone insane.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.290
Just a moment, Mrs McCarthy.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.210
The shame of it.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.090
Unless you've heard that poor soul

16:08.140 --> 16:11.900
knocking on his coffin to be
let out, you must stop this.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.450
There's nothing here.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.780
Oh, surprise, surprise(!)
What are you up to?

16:21.420 --> 16:22.970
Nothing.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.810
A likely story.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.090
Now I'm going to have to
clear all this up,

16:28.140 --> 16:29.780
get some fresh flowers.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.330
And do you think you could resist
digging up any more residents

16:35.380 --> 16:36.660
until I get back?

16:37.820 --> 16:39.500
Scout's honour.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.900
SHE SIGHS

16:58.060 --> 17:00.050
May I?

17:00.100 --> 17:01.740
Please.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.730
You aren't going to read it?

17:08.780 --> 17:11.050
~ What did you make of it? ~ Nothing.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.690
Spare me the modesty.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.089
You've solved too many crimes to be
the bumbling idiot you appear to be.

17:16.140 --> 17:20.089
No, I am a bumbling idiot.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.369
But I see patterns to things.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.369
You seem to know a lot about me.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.010
You've shown up on our radar
a few times.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.740
Have you got a file on me?

17:29.820 --> 17:32.090
Why don't we pool our resources?

17:32.140 --> 17:34.090
We both want the same thing,
after all.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.490
~ Do we? ~ The truth.

17:35.540 --> 17:37.330
I want my friend released.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.940
Then perhaps you could start
by telling me about the letter.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.290
Well, it obviously
wasn't meant for me

17:50.340 --> 17:53.170
and Archie didn't leave it
for his colleagues either,

17:53.220 --> 17:55.340
which means he didn't trust them.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.410
He wanted it to go to an outsider -
someone who'd come to

17:59.460 --> 18:01.130
investigate if things went wrong -

18:01.180 --> 18:02.420
you.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.770
But I got to the manor house first,

18:06.820 --> 18:10.900
which meant Lord Masters got
the wrong end of the stick...

18:13.260 --> 18:16.610
.. and doesn't know what's
going on in his own house.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.140
But you do.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.660
I'm sure Lady Felicia
has filled you in.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.730
She said nothing.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.090
Fine.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.330
If you want to play it that way.
My name is Daniel Whittaker

18:30.380 --> 18:31.970
and I work for the Security Service.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.730
There, can we move on now?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.650
Yes, I'd like to know how Sid is.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.450
~ Maybe later. You worked out
what the message means. ~ Yes.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.930
It wasn't a question.
What did you find?

18:42.980 --> 18:44.570
Nothing.

18:44.620 --> 18:48.570
Local officers don't know the
sources of each others' aliases -

18:48.620 --> 18:49.890
only senior staff.

18:49.940 --> 18:51.540
And you, it appears.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.420
I recognised the name.

18:56.980 --> 19:01.060
I buried Archibald Waterson
20 years ago.

19:03.220 --> 19:06.650
~ He was 18 months old.
A tragic death. ~ I can imagine.

19:06.700 --> 19:10.570
Why did your man use
that poor little boy's name?

19:10.620 --> 19:13.930
When we create new identities
for our officers,

19:13.980 --> 19:17.570
it's easier to use
real people - dead people.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.530
There's an existing paper trail
we can manipulate.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.460
~ How tasteless. ~ You did ask.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.090
Do you know who killed
that young man?

19:28.140 --> 19:30.410
What did you find at the grave?

19:30.460 --> 19:32.940
I found nothing there.

19:34.420 --> 19:37.850
We found your friend trespassing
in a very sensitive area.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
It's a serious charge, espionage.

19:42.540 --> 19:45.740
I did not find
anything at that grave.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.610
I'll see you later, Father.

19:49.660 --> 19:51.530
I thought we were sharing
information?

19:51.580 --> 19:52.610
I've changed my mind.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.530
You cannot play with
an innocent man's life like this.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.610
~ Actually, I can. ~ I cannot
give you what I do not have.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.690
Don't leave it too long
to come to your senses.

20:00.740 --> 20:03.340
Once people disappear,
it can be hard to find them again.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.420
Take a seat.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.130
I want to see Sid.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.930
Sorry, orders from on high -
no visitors.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.370
Then let me
speak to Daniel Whittaker.

20:16.420 --> 20:18.010
Can I ask why?

20:18.060 --> 20:19.810
You can ask.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.770
Ah, good. I'll need your office.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.620
Lady Felicia, this way.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.060
I suppose this is your doing?

20:45.580 --> 20:47.690
What happened?

20:47.740 --> 20:51.620
I went down to put fresh flowers
on that grave. This is what I found.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.290
Is that the only vase that
was broken?

20:55.340 --> 20:57.130
Yes. Why?

20:57.180 --> 21:00.860
Because the vase
on Archie's grave was cream.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.690
Why are you here, Daniel?

21:09.740 --> 21:12.490
Oh, the usual.
Trying to save the country.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.330
We're hardly in danger out here.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.290
It's that kind of complacency
that'll get us all killed.

21:17.340 --> 21:21.130
Oh, is that your job? Going round
trying to frighten people?

21:21.180 --> 21:24.050
We don't have officers out
in this godforsaken nowhere

21:24.100 --> 21:25.930
just for the fun of it.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.570
It's because the fight is going on
right now, all around us.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.690
Is that why you
had my driver arrested?

21:30.740 --> 21:33.050
Because he's a threat
to national security?

21:33.100 --> 21:34.740
We all need a little leverage.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.940
Your priest has something I need.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.220
A conscience?

21:42.420 --> 21:44.380
An item he found in his graveyard.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.650
What is it?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.250
I don't know.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.050
I thought you might find out
and bring it to me.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.570
You are joking?

21:53.620 --> 21:57.410
Oh, I rarely joke. Especially
when reputations are concerned.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.210
I really don't care
what you tell people about me.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.530
How about the Earl?
Does he feel the same way?

22:03.580 --> 22:05.210
We paid our debt.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.810
And we're very grateful for that.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.370
So now we're offering you another
chance to help your country.

22:11.420 --> 22:12.930
This isn't fair.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.970
Past indiscretions can
be made to vanish for a while,

22:16.020 --> 22:18.770
but sadly they never really go away.

22:18.820 --> 22:23.010
Which is a problem for men
who rely on their reputation.

22:23.060 --> 22:26.780
A few words in the right ears,
who knows what the fallout might be?

22:29.220 --> 22:32.090
I need something from you in return.

22:32.140 --> 22:33.540
The man who died.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.970
I want details.

22:37.020 --> 22:41.370
Why not? Your friend
might unearth something useful.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.020
But you know the price.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.700
Yes.

22:53.060 --> 22:54.500
You swapped the vases!

22:55.540 --> 22:57.530
Now, don't you go giving me grief.

22:57.580 --> 23:00.570
Someone had to tidy up
the mess you made...

23:00.620 --> 23:02.180
Father Brown...!

23:10.060 --> 23:13.530
"Dear Mother, enjoying my holiday.
Weather fine.

23:13.580 --> 23:16.570
"It was a long journey,
but we got here safely.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.060
"Your loving daughter, Marjory."

23:20.380 --> 23:21.780
And what does that mean?

23:22.980 --> 23:25.810
It means Marjory
is having a nice holiday.

23:25.860 --> 23:29.100
What have you gone and got
yourself mixed up in this time?

23:30.700 --> 23:33.250
It's safer if you don't know.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.860
I am a grown woman!
I don't need protecting.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.930
But maybe he did.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.580
Now, please, don't start
talking in riddles.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.970
Take this.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.660
Put it somewhere safe.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.180
Oh, and he's off again.

23:59.580 --> 24:00.860
Oh...

24:12.180 --> 24:13.860
We can name the baby after him?

24:16.100 --> 24:18.690
It would be a way
of remembering him.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.380
I'm hardly likely to forget.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.370
Sorry.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.700
~ It was just a thought.
~ Hey, I'm sorry.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.780
I should be stronger than this.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.860
KNOCKING

24:39.180 --> 24:41.100
Father Brown. Please, come in.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.890
~ Hello. ~ What can we do for you?

24:46.940 --> 24:50.740
Perhaps I should start by saying
that I know what you do.

24:52.580 --> 24:55.620
Not exactly, but I know that
you're more than historians.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.090
And I've had a thought...

24:59.140 --> 25:01.690
and I wondered
if you could help me?

25:01.740 --> 25:02.980
What with?

25:08.100 --> 25:11.460
I think we all know that
Archie's death was not an accident.

25:13.540 --> 25:16.130
He deliberately put himself
in danger and paid the price.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.490
What makes you think that?

25:17.540 --> 25:20.210
I've been trying to work out why.
At first, I thought he must have

25:20.260 --> 25:24.090
been in trouble, but then another
possibility occurred to me.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.890
Compassion.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.890
He was trying to save someone else.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.500
Save them from what?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.980
Well, I was rather hoping
you could tell me that.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.610
If you know what we are,

25:37.660 --> 25:41.170
then you'll understand
that we can't talk about this.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.580
A shame.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.610
I was hoping to reach out
to whoever Archie was trying to help

25:48.660 --> 25:52.300
because they must be carrying
a terrible burden.

25:59.580 --> 26:01.100
I must be mistaken.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.690
Silly me.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.660
I'm always wading out of my depth.

26:10.540 --> 26:12.340
I won't trouble you any longer.

26:13.900 --> 26:16.580
Why did you say that
he put himself in danger?

26:19.460 --> 26:23.850
He left a note, in case
anything happened to him.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.890
What did it say?

26:25.940 --> 26:29.460
Oh, it's not my place to tell you.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.780
Good day.

26:41.980 --> 26:43.490
Hello, William.

26:43.540 --> 26:45.010
Why do you think I was involved?

26:45.060 --> 26:46.940
I know a broken man when I see one.

26:48.420 --> 26:49.970
What was in Archie's letter?

26:50.020 --> 26:54.490
There's a game going on around me,
one I do not wish to play.

26:54.540 --> 27:00.140
Spies and official bullies
and all manner of madness.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.410
The people in my parish
are suffering because of this.

27:05.460 --> 27:08.170
They are my only concern.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.900
Then help me.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.370
I've done a terrible thing.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.300
FATHER BROWN SIGHS

27:19.340 --> 27:20.890
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

27:20.940 --> 27:24.540
It's been six weeks since
my last confession. I...

27:25.700 --> 27:27.100
.. I killed my best friend.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.380
What happened?

27:33.340 --> 27:37.090
Archie had intercepted a dead drop...

27:37.140 --> 27:40.050
a message to the Soviets
about our work at the manor.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.140
Marion was still at work.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.650
Archie came to confront me
over what he had discovered.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.570
Why?

27:48.620 --> 27:50.300
Because I sent the message.

27:53.180 --> 27:54.740
I used to be a Soviet spy.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.210
Does Marion know?

27:58.260 --> 27:59.740
No.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.940
No, it would destroy her.

28:04.220 --> 28:08.060
It was being with her that
first made me change my views.

28:09.860 --> 28:13.610
I realised we could have
a better life here. A family.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.250
The past six months,
I've just fed the Soviets lies

28:16.300 --> 28:17.930
and inconsequential information.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.730
Did you explain this to Archie?

28:19.780 --> 28:21.100
I tried...

28:22.780 --> 28:23.970
.. but he was furious.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.690
'I trusted you!'

28:25.740 --> 28:27.100
He felt betrayed.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.170
He attacked me.

28:30.220 --> 28:31.660
I just wanted him to stop.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.730
To give me a chance to explain.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.580
He was frantic.

28:37.660 --> 28:39.210
He broke a bottle.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.370
It was just instinct.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.610
There was a knife.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.090
I didn't mean to hurt him.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.450
'Argh!'

28:45.500 --> 28:46.940
I swear.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.890
I can't live with myself.

28:51.940 --> 28:54.740
Please, Father,
please absolve me of my sins.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.130
I can't.

28:58.180 --> 28:59.860
What?

29:02.260 --> 29:04.460
You attacked Sid Carter
this morning.

29:06.540 --> 29:07.930
I panicked.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.210
What you did was deliberate.

29:10.260 --> 29:14.100
So how can I believe
you regret anything?

29:15.660 --> 29:17.330
You can't tell anyone.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.730
I won't, but I urge you
to give yourself up

29:20.780 --> 29:23.530
~ for the sake of your mortal soul.
~ They'll kill me.

29:23.580 --> 29:28.050
I must warn you that Archie left
what he found for your superiors.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.850
Others will follow, looking for you.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.330
What can I do? Marion is pregnant.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.180
How can I tell her what I am?
What I was?

29:38.060 --> 29:40.060
Then you will pay a terrible price.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.900
For that, I am sorry.

29:47.460 --> 29:48.860
Keep an eye on her...

29:51.820 --> 29:53.370
.. and on my child.

29:53.420 --> 29:56.810
~ Make sure that they're all right.
~ Of course.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.970
I'll get the train to London,
disappear until I can find a...

30:00.020 --> 30:01.460
Don't tell me your plans.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.300
I don't want anything more
to do with this.

30:10.700 --> 30:15.060
Goodbye, Father. I'm sorry
I couldn't be a better man.

30:31.420 --> 30:32.940
What's the matter?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.540
You're scaring me.

30:51.060 --> 30:53.700
~ Is Father Brown here?
~ No, he is not.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.610
Do you know when he'll be back?

30:57.660 --> 30:59.490
Oh, I thought you could tell me.

30:59.540 --> 31:03.650
I presume you're a part
of his latest little escapade?

31:03.700 --> 31:05.290
No.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.970
Why? What's he been up too?

31:08.020 --> 31:09.690
Heaven only knows.

31:09.740 --> 31:13.340
But he seems to think this
has something to do with it.

31:15.980 --> 31:17.780
Hello?

31:19.140 --> 31:20.810
Her Royal Highness is here,

31:20.860 --> 31:24.250
and your precious postcard
is behind the tea caddy.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.660
Oh, and your dinner is in the oven.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.410
Lady Felicia.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.690
Any luck?

31:38.740 --> 31:40.340
A copy of the police report.

31:42.820 --> 31:45.010
How did you manage that?

31:45.060 --> 31:48.650
Oh, you know, wild flirtations
and laughing at dreadful jokes.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.100
I need to go.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.810
Are you all right?

31:52.860 --> 31:54.180
Yes.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.580
It's frightening, what
we've got ourselves involved in.

32:03.740 --> 32:07.130
Better get on. I need to explain
to my husband why I've invited

32:07.180 --> 32:09.450
that landed lunatic to our soiree.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.740
Ha-ha. Mmm.

32:14.940 --> 32:16.460
DOOR CLOSES

32:20.380 --> 32:22.250
We do still have police
business to conduct.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.930
I'm sure you'll cope.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.690
Lady Felicia.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.260
Take it.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.420
~ Thank you for your service.
~ Go to hell.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.980
Inspector!

33:26.180 --> 33:28.690
Get your people to watch
the roads out of town.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.130
We'll take the station.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.130
~ Why? ~ We have our man.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.020
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

34:07.740 --> 34:10.489
The ticket clerk saw a man
fitting his description.

34:10.540 --> 34:12.889
He bought a ticket to London.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.810
Sir?

34:14.860 --> 34:16.370
Father Brown.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.650
That'll keep him out of our way.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.620
That's the train for Birmingham.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.219
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

34:28.620 --> 34:30.210
Ah.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.969
The thing about my job is you do
drink an awful lot of tea

34:33.020 --> 34:34.739
and I do like my sugar.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.179
And the inevitable biscuit.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.969
How did you find me?

34:43.020 --> 34:45.210
When a chap in your line of work
says one thing,

34:45.260 --> 34:47.050
you can be sure he means another.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.210
And you said you
were going to London.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.250
Did you bring the police?

34:51.300 --> 34:53.889
Our conversation remains
between us and God.

34:53.940 --> 34:57.450
Although I do think you
have some explaining to do.

34:57.500 --> 35:00.250
I've just seen my wife's
face for the last time.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.170
My child will grow up
without a father.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.890
Can you call that justice?

35:03.940 --> 35:05.810
You lied to me.

35:05.860 --> 35:07.810
The confession is sacrosanct,

35:07.860 --> 35:10.890
not somewhere where you
can spin stories.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.690
The train is stopping.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.450
It's signals.

35:14.500 --> 35:15.970
We're only just out of Kembleford.

35:16.020 --> 35:18.610
Another train coming in.
Single line working.

35:18.660 --> 35:19.820
This is your doing.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.540
No-one knows you're here.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.970
Stay where you are!

35:26.020 --> 35:27.220
Liar.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.370
William!

35:31.420 --> 35:33.220
William!

35:37.060 --> 35:38.980
Keep back! Both of you!

35:40.620 --> 35:42.220
Just stay calm.

35:44.980 --> 35:46.770
Tunnel.

35:46.820 --> 35:48.010
What?

35:48.060 --> 35:49.610
Tunnel!

35:49.660 --> 35:51.220
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

35:53.820 --> 35:57.100
Please let me help you.
I know you didn't kill your friend.

36:00.340 --> 36:03.410
~ We've got him now.
~ No! You have to get in there.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.700
~ He's not going anywhere. ~ Do it.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.540
Oh, no.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.180
Damn.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.660
I'm sorry.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.580
SHE CRIES QUIETLY

36:31.700 --> 36:33.740
How did you know he was involved?

36:35.100 --> 36:37.980
You do realise this is
an official investigation?

36:40.460 --> 36:42.380
I'm bound by different laws.

36:44.820 --> 36:48.290
How did you know
he'd be on that train?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.650
Lucky guess.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.450
Shouldn't you be writing this down?

36:53.500 --> 36:55.660
As you said, different laws.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.850
If you let Sid Carter go,
I will ensure that he says

37:00.900 --> 37:03.370
nothing about what he has seen.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.940
We don't make deals.

37:06.420 --> 37:08.260
I think you will this time.

37:09.580 --> 37:10.810
I found...

37:10.860 --> 37:15.740
I already have the postcard,
thanks to a friend of yours.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.700
Well, I think that's all.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.020
You can go.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.740
KETTLE WHISTLES

37:29.980 --> 37:31.420
I'll get you a tea.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.530
You don't need to.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.100
The kettle was already on.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.690
I know William
cared very much for you.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.340
He would have done anything for you.

37:44.900 --> 37:47.810
No matter what trouble you were in.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.050
What do you mean?

37:50.100 --> 37:53.540
He died trying to throw us
off the scent.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.980
He made himself look guilty...

37:59.540 --> 38:02.740
.. so that we thought
he was acting on his own.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.900
Have a seat.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.500
Could I trouble you for some sugar?

38:52.100 --> 38:54.100
Only I have a terrible sweet tooth.

38:57.420 --> 39:00.860
The story William told me
can't be true.

39:03.780 --> 39:06.460
I've read the police
report on Archie's death.

39:09.100 --> 39:12.180
Archie found out that William
was a Soviet agent.

39:13.940 --> 39:17.020
He should have reported him,
but he didn't.

39:18.540 --> 39:22.460
He wanted his friend to explain.
But there was no misunderstanding.

39:23.780 --> 39:26.060
William was working
for the other side.

39:27.820 --> 39:29.770
It turned into a fight,

39:29.820 --> 39:33.500
but William couldn't have killed
Archie in self-defence...

39:35.700 --> 39:37.780
.. because Archie was stabbed
in the back.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.620
It's an interesting story.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.610
Before I came here,

40:01.660 --> 40:05.100
I prayed that you only acted
to defend your husband.

40:06.420 --> 40:09.020
That you had no idea
of his political beliefs.

40:11.060 --> 40:14.900
On the contrary,
you defected to his cause.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.250
And why would you think that?

40:18.300 --> 40:21.380
When he was cornered,
William took his own life...

40:22.420 --> 40:27.060
.. as I imagine he was trained to do,
rather than be captured.

40:29.180 --> 40:32.780
And you showed your hand
when you put cyanide...

40:34.300 --> 40:35.700
.. into your tea.

40:38.340 --> 40:44.220
I will not let you take
your own life and your child's.

40:45.340 --> 40:46.780
It won't be long now.

40:50.180 --> 40:51.620
I swapped the teas.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.850
I should just follow you
around all day, Father.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.300
You turn up the most
interesting things.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.020
FATHER BROWN SIGHS

41:19.340 --> 41:21.890
~ You know what I did? ~ Yes.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.210
I'm so sorry.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.050
There's no need for you
to apologise.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.010
I betrayed you.

41:27.060 --> 41:31.690
I'm sure you did what you did
for the best of reasons.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.570
Selfish ones.

41:33.620 --> 41:37.170
Well, without the police report,
I wouldn't have known the truth

41:37.220 --> 41:40.780
and I'm sure Daniel charged you
a high price for it.

41:43.820 --> 41:46.970
Right, let's bring
Sid from the choky.

41:47.020 --> 41:48.540
If you say so.

41:55.900 --> 41:58.690
Next time, keep quiet
when I tell you.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.370
Whatever you say, Inspector.

42:00.420 --> 42:02.250
Are you all right?

42:02.300 --> 42:03.970
I'll live.

42:04.020 --> 42:08.340
Oh, I'll be on my way. Thank you,
Father, for your assistance.

42:11.380 --> 42:14.890
You have a keen mind.
You're wasted out here.

42:14.940 --> 42:16.410
On the contrary,

42:16.460 --> 42:19.850
I think that you've proved
that this is where I should be.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.970
There's a war on,
just as terrible as the last one.

42:23.020 --> 42:26.940
The Red Menace poses as much
of a threat as the Nazis ever did.

42:28.540 --> 42:31.730
Then we have to hold ourselves
to higher standards.

42:31.780 --> 42:35.730
If we resort to bullying
and underhand tactics,

42:35.780 --> 42:38.050
then what's the point?

42:38.100 --> 42:39.580
We're as bad as them.

42:40.580 --> 42:44.090
You've no idea what goes on
to let you live in ignorant peace.

42:44.140 --> 42:46.260
The evils I see every single day.

42:49.540 --> 42:51.220
Then I feel for you.

42:54.140 --> 42:55.460
Lady Felicia.

43:02.820 --> 43:04.780
Inspector?

43:06.020 --> 43:07.540
Sad to see him go?

43:12.100 --> 43:13.620
Get out of here, Father.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.940
PHONE RINGS

43:25.300 --> 43:28.420
'Father Brown, I need your help!'

43:31.740 --> 43:35.890
I woke up this morning
and my whole staff has changed -

43:35.940 --> 43:38.130
unless I'm losing my marbles.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.500
Surely not.

43:40.580 --> 43:43.980
Over 18 months they've been
working in here.

43:47.420 --> 43:49.700
What have they been doing
all this time?
