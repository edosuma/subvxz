00:04.567 --> 00:07.133
I am going to be
in an off-Broadway play.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.133
There's only one problem.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.000
I was born with hearing loss.

00:10.033 --> 00:13.166
I'm gonna try
the extra small hearing aid.

00:13.166 --> 00:14.166
Oh, my god.

you f---ed her,

- Don't answer for her.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.300
- Annalise deserves
to know the truth.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.433
- As far as the egg freezing...

00:36.467 --> 00:38.066
- You happened to lie to me.

00:38.066 --> 00:40.000
- Yeah, because I don't
trust you.

00:40.033 --> 00:41.467
- I know you love her,

00:41.500 --> 00:44.333
and I know right now your anger
is stemming from hurt.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.033
- Of course I'm hurt.

00:46.066 --> 00:47.467
- But her pain has nothing
to do with me.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.266

that I love and adore.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.533

over a cold, so...

02:09.500 --> 02:11.633
I brought a vision board.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.533

02:13.533 --> 02:15.000
I'm gonna die.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.533
Right now, it's condo first.

Then, we can start family,

03:02.667 --> 03:04.166
- I just got my knee makeup

03:04.166 --> 03:05.166
- Exactly.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.367
And in two years,

03:06.400 --> 03:09.400

will be dirty beige,

- Bread, would you like some?

we're gonna do, okay?

Looking back, when I started
this project years ago,

it was always about me

- At the end of the day,
I'm a hustler.

another reason

any kids myself,

that's so untapped.

There's a handful of companies
out there that are doing this.

But most of the shoes that you
see on the market right now,

06:47.500 --> 06:49.266
they literally disintegrate
in your hands,

06:49.300 --> 06:51.333
because they're using
the cheapest materials.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.433
These are premium, you know?

06:53.467 --> 06:56.233
- It's soft, it's flexible,
it's not restricting.

06:56.266 --> 06:57.500

06:57.533 --> 06:59.633
- These baby shoes...
- These are dope.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.467
- This is probably
my favorite one, for the kids.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.767
- Like I'm saying, dude,

it would be super cute
if Dad takes his son out,

and the baby's rocking theirs.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.700
I think we can make
something happen, man.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.233
I'm thinking two size runs
of the mens,

07:26.233 --> 07:28.033
a size run of the womens,
a size run of the kids.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.000

in our journey.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.533

times you get knocked down.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.166

of some huge play.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.166
But, I mean, lots of actors
have a crazy past,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.433

or Robert Downey Jr.,

17:16.033 --> 17:18.133
They somehow managed
to pull it off.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.467
I could do it.

at Thanksgiving,

17:32.066 --> 17:33.433

17:33.467 --> 17:35.166

through a lot,

17:35.200 --> 17:36.533
but at the end of the day,

17:36.567 --> 17:39.400
sometimes people just need
to forget and forgive,

17:39.433 --> 17:41.533

no matter what.

17:41.567 --> 17:43.200

not just with me,

17:46.467 --> 17:49.333

17:49.367 --> 17:51.033

17:54.200 --> 17:56.200

18:01.066 --> 18:02.367

out of my parents' house

25:23.433 --> 25:24.767
and steal their car.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.300
- This is where Robyn Brown
taps into her inner tiger.

25:28.300 --> 25:30.033
- I'm gonna let him know

25:30.066 --> 25:35.700
that I...am gonna
take very good care of him.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.100
- Holy banana.

25:38.133 --> 25:39.100
Whoa!

25:39.133 --> 25:40.133
[laughter]

25:40.166 --> 25:41.133
- Yes.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.600
That is so good.

25:42.600 --> 25:47.467
- Ms. Brown.
- That's Professor Brown.

25:47.467 --> 25:50.133
- I've discussed the basics
of my play with Shalom,

25:50.166 --> 25:55.066
but I think it's just better
to leave some things unsaid,

25:55.066 --> 25:56.567
like making out with a guy.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.433
- Ah, ha-ha.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.000
- While acting.

26:00.033 --> 26:01.467
- Is Michael gonna
make your boyfriend jealous?

26:01.467 --> 26:05.000
- I'm letting him know
Michael's gay.

26:05.033 --> 26:07.600
[laughter]

26:11.467 --> 26:13.000
- I like this hotel.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.467
It's a landmark of L.A.

26:15.467 --> 26:18.467
This place, I know they have
a good filet mignon.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.633
- Only the best for you, Vida.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.367
- Let me get the door.

26:23.367 --> 26:24.767
- I'm not that old, Merc.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.767
- I'm not saying--
it's out of courtesy.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.100
- I can get out of the car
on my own,

26:29.100 --> 26:30.567
walk to the restaurant.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.433
- But I can't
open your door for you?

26:36.133 --> 26:37.166
- Ooh.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.100
- Welcome to the Biltmore Hotel.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.633
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.500
- May I suggest something
from the bar today?

26:42.533 --> 26:44.166
- Ice water and iced tea,
please.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.100
- And for you?
- The same.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.633
- And have you taken a look
at the menu yet?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.567
- Do you have filet mignon?

26:49.600 --> 26:52.367
- I'd be happy to,
probably a nice filet mignon,

26:52.400 --> 26:54.767
maybe garnish
with some vegetables.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.767
- I like filet mignon.

26:56.767 --> 26:58.467
- What about French fries?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.500
- I think that sounds wonderful.

27:01.533 --> 27:02.700
- Surprise me.

27:02.734 --> 27:04.500
- Okay, thank you so much.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.533
- Even though
she's a big pain in the ass,

27:10.567 --> 27:14.667
I'm choosing not to abandon Vida
because she gets mean sometimes.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.633
- You don't look rested.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.500
- I'm always gonna be
a sucker for her,

27:18.533 --> 27:21.000
because I know nothing matters
more in the world to her

27:21.000 --> 27:23.667
than connecting with me
and being involved in my life.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.500
She wants nothing
but the best for me.

27:26.533 --> 27:29.133
- Filet mignon.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.467
- That looks really nice.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.734
I hope I got more French fries
than my mom.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.133
- Thank you.

27:34.133 --> 27:36.734
- The thing is, Mom,

27:36.767 --> 27:43.500
my intention is to seriously
try to get pregnant.

27:43.533 --> 27:46.033
- Pregnant?

27:46.033 --> 27:47.567
You mean with Tommy?

27:47.567 --> 27:49.033
- Yes.

27:49.033 --> 27:50.667
- He's not patient
to be a father.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.033
Maybe he doesn't want
to be a father right now.

27:52.066 --> 27:53.166
- He does.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.567
I need you to be in,

27:54.567 --> 27:56.233
"I'm gonna get her pregnant,"
mental space.

27:56.266 --> 27:57.233
- I'm gonna go to work.

27:57.266 --> 27:58.500
I'm gonna do my part.

28:00.567 --> 28:02.166
- He's the one
that's gonna get me pregnant.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.166
He has to want it.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.100
- No "he has to, he must do."

28:05.133 --> 28:07.567
- No, I mean, he won't do it
if he doesn't want to.

28:07.567 --> 28:09.100
- No, he says yes, of course.

28:09.133 --> 28:10.533
He says yes to please you.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.700
But in reality,
you think that you can

28:12.700 --> 28:14.166
leave the baby with him

28:14.166 --> 28:17.166
and be sure that
he's not watching game,

28:17.166 --> 28:19.567
he doesn't neglect the baby?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.533
I think he's
the kind of person that,

28:21.567 --> 28:23.233
you get in fight with him,

28:23.266 --> 28:27.600
he's gonna put the baby
in his backpack and walk away.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.467
Are you willing to take a risk?

28:29.467 --> 28:30.467
- Yes.

28:30.467 --> 28:31.467
- Of the baby too?

28:31.467 --> 28:33.467
- Exactly.

28:33.500 --> 28:37.700
My mom's high expectations
definitely had a big impact

28:37.734 --> 28:40.033
on me keeping men
at arm's length.

28:40.066 --> 28:43.266
- Don't you think Charlie's
handsome and tall?

28:43.300 --> 28:44.667
- Tall?
- He's 6'1".

28:44.700 --> 28:46.567
- It's average for a man.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.066
- He's not a good match for you.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.033
- You haven't gotten a chance
to get to know him.

28:50.066 --> 28:52.600
- But I can tell
that he's not.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.066
- But now that I've met the man

28:55.066 --> 28:59.133
that I want to have babies with
and grow old and decrepit with.

28:59.166 --> 29:01.467
- You always fall in love
with the wrong people.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.066
- Oh, my god.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.600
I very much have to stand up
for myself as a woman

29:05.600 --> 29:08.500
and say, "I'm grown now,
this is what we're doing."

29:08.500 --> 29:10.567
- I fell in love with Tommy;
you didn't.

29:10.600 --> 29:15.633
It's time for you
to accept me and my choices,

29:15.633 --> 29:18.500
and not only accept them,
but to support them.

29:18.533 --> 29:20.233
I know you don't want
to accept it, Vida, joon,

29:20.266 --> 29:23.066
but you are going to be
a grandmother.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.633
- You are my daughter,

29:24.633 --> 29:26.734
and I think I know
what's best for my daughter.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.266
- No, you don't.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.633
- Yeah, I f---ed around before.

29:32.633 --> 29:33.633
- You asshole.

29:33.633 --> 29:34.734
- How many girls?

29:34.767 --> 29:36.100
- Five, six.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.000
- You motherf---ing
piece of sh--.

29:52.066 --> 29:52.266
- [whistles]

29:52.266 --> 29:52.667
- [whistles]
- Bitch, I'm not your dog!

29:54.400 --> 29:56.000
- It's the Persian doorbell.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.667
I can see your bulge, player.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.667
God damn.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.133
- [laughs]

30:00.166 --> 30:01.133
- Hop in.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.667
- These are workout shorts.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.367
They have built-in underwear.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.066
My naneh wears these.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.266
- No, she doesn't.
- She does.

30:07.266 --> 30:09.000
- Your naneh is very stylish,
by the way.

30:09.033 --> 30:10.133
- Right?

30:10.166 --> 30:11.767
- Mike, what the f---
are you wearing?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.133
We're going to paint.

30:13.133 --> 30:14.667
- Paint what?
- Her apartment.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.100
- Paint whose apartment, MJ's?
- MJ, yeah.

30:17.133 --> 30:18.667
- F--- no.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.667
- Why do you think
you're coming today to help?

30:20.667 --> 30:23.133
- She said there's pizza
and beer being served.

30:23.166 --> 30:26.066
- You're in for
a rude awakening, my friend.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.200
I'm not gonna lie.

30:27.233 --> 30:29.734
It's irritating
to be a laborer,

30:29.767 --> 30:32.033
a free laborer at that.

30:32.033 --> 30:34.133
But, on the plus side,

30:34.166 --> 30:36.300
it's actually
gonna achieve something

30:36.300 --> 30:38.133
that needs to get done

30:38.166 --> 30:40.000
and needs to get done
right away.

30:40.033 --> 30:42.567
I'm all about
forward movement today.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.266
Whether we like it or not
design-wise,

30:45.300 --> 30:46.700
we need to be nice.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.700
She gets really offended
if you talk sh-- about it.

30:50.734 --> 30:52.700
- I'm gonna try my best.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.633
- Do you want to take bets on
how many times she'll cry today?

30:55.667 --> 30:58.033
- Oh-ho-ho.

31:05.734 --> 31:07.166
- Got to paint the girls

31:07.200 --> 31:10.767
before we paint the walls
or anything else.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.066
- Oh, my god,
it smells good in here.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.667
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.433
- What's up, how's it going?
- Hi.

31:17.467 --> 31:20.133
- Okay, hi.

31:20.166 --> 31:22.200
Welcome, thank you
for coming and helping me.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.433
- Absolutely, I love you.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.066
- Okay, let's get to work.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.266
What are we here to do?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.166
- We're gonna cover
the floors first,

31:28.200 --> 31:30.300
and then we're gonna get
painting started too.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.200
I am long overdue

31:32.233 --> 31:36.033
to graduate from Get My Sh--
Together University.

31:36.066 --> 31:38.300
- We could actually make this
your newlywed pad.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.667
- So you're gonna do that
for us?

31:39.700 --> 31:41.066
- Are you gonna have kids?

31:41.066 --> 31:42.667
Do you need a place
for your kids?

31:42.700 --> 31:44.667
- Yeah, we're gonna have kids
in like five minutes.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.667
- Okay, well,
it's a great kids room.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.333
- Just like
in "Field of Dreams,"

31:48.333 --> 31:50.700
when you say, "If you build it,
they will come,"

31:50.734 --> 31:54.200
but in this scenario,
Ray Liotta is my son

31:54.233 --> 31:57.633
who grows up to be an MLB pro.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.033
- That's so weird,
how did this--

31:59.066 --> 32:00.200
oh, this screws in here?

32:00.233 --> 32:04.300
I don't want to destroy it.

32:04.333 --> 32:09.233
Damn, you're a f---ing thug.

32:09.266 --> 32:12.633
- Okay, cool.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.767
- So do you see this dirt
along the base molding?

32:15.767 --> 32:16.767
It's sticky.

32:16.767 --> 32:18.367
- The couch was blocking this.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.066
- Merc, I'm not complaining
about it.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.367
I'm just making a request.

32:21.367 --> 32:22.633
- I'm not saying
you're complaining.

32:22.633 --> 32:24.100
- Just clean across the bottom.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.767
- And what does this
look like to you?

32:26.000 --> 32:29.166
Somebody on her hands and knees,
wiping this.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.367
- Since you're on your knees,
MJ.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.633
Hey, MJ, MJ.

32:32.667 --> 32:33.633
- [laughs]

32:33.667 --> 32:35.233
- [laughing]

32:35.266 --> 32:36.433
- Ugh.

32:36.467 --> 32:38.400
- [laughing]

32:38.433 --> 32:39.533
- Yo, yo, yo.

32:39.533 --> 32:43.233
- Shervin be swervin'!

32:43.266 --> 32:44.400
- Shervin's bringing you
some cool stuff,

32:44.400 --> 32:45.400
is what he's doing.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.433
- Thank you.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.133
- What's up, buddy?
- Good to see you.

32:50.133 --> 32:53.000
- Oh, hell yeah.
- What up, girl?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.200
- Who else is coming?

32:54.233 --> 32:56.400
- I know that Asa
could not be asked

32:56.433 --> 32:58.400
to participate in this.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.133
- You didn't ask her
to come over?

33:00.166 --> 33:02.500
- The last thing
that I'm gonna do

33:02.533 --> 33:05.200
is pretend that she should be
in a room with people

33:05.233 --> 33:07.133
that she doesn't want
to be in a room with.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.767
- So where does this put us?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.400
Like, what the f---
are we supposed to do?

33:10.433 --> 33:12.133
- What kind of friendship
do you have

33:12.133 --> 33:14.667
if it's not 100%
honest with each other?

33:14.700 --> 33:16.667
- You have an acquaintanceship,
is what you have.

33:16.700 --> 33:18.300
- That's right.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.100
- I definitely view
my friendship with Asa

33:20.133 --> 33:21.767
in a different light now.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.300
She doesn't understand
that there's a correlation

33:24.300 --> 33:27.433
between her sharing secrets
with me

33:27.467 --> 33:29.700
and the pain it caused MJ,

33:29.734 --> 33:31.400
and the rift.

33:31.433 --> 33:34.133
It doesn't exist in her world.

33:34.166 --> 33:37.166
- I wish I wasn't the one
that you confided in.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.133
And I'm f---ed if I do,
and I'm f---ed if I don't.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.300
- But that's not my fault.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.367
- She's not gonna
change her mind,

33:44.400 --> 33:48.367
and she's sure as hell
not gonna apologize to MJ.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.166
- We get to a point in our lives

33:50.166 --> 33:53.300
where we need our friends,
to lean on each other.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.300
- We need to keep
each other accountable.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.033
- We have to keep
each other in check.

33:57.033 --> 33:58.266
- I don't want fake friends.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.166
- There's no point
in having a friendship

34:00.200 --> 34:02.467
if I can't share something
with you, and vice versa.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.166
- You want a taquito?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.400
- No, thank you,
that's actually a dog treat.

34:06.433 --> 34:07.333
[laughter]

34:07.333 --> 34:08.333
Very tempting.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.467
[knocking]

34:09.467 --> 34:11.300
- You guys, did someone knock?

34:11.333 --> 34:13.467
- I'll go get it,
you're eating, brother.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.166
- What it do, it do?
- Oh, sh--.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.066
- Hi!

34:19.066 --> 34:21.533
- How y'all doing?
- Hi, boo-boo.

34:21.567 --> 34:22.734
- You know what we need?

34:22.734 --> 34:23.734
Shots.

34:23.734 --> 34:25.033
We're celebrating.

34:25.066 --> 34:28.000
- So what can I do?
- Drink.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.200
- I'll do it.

34:29.233 --> 34:34.200
- You guys, I feel
like Mr. Miyagi right now.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.333
- Somebody give Reza
a baby shot.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.300
- Just a baby shot.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.133
- Then down it, bitch.

34:40.166 --> 34:41.333
Whoo!

34:41.333 --> 34:43.100
Mike, take off your shirt.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.100
- I can take off my pants.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.100
It's more impressive.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.600
- Do that.

34:46.633 --> 34:48.767
I don't want you to get
any paint on your nice jeans.

34:49.000 --> 34:49.767
- You see my underwear?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.500
- Is that directions for women?

34:51.533 --> 34:55.033
[laughter]

34:55.066 --> 34:57.033
- Oh, Shervin f---ed up!

34:59.100 --> 35:00.633
- I'll fix it, relax.

35:00.633 --> 35:02.333
- That's nothing,
it's a little frickin'...

35:02.367 --> 35:04.066
- The whole ceiling is, like,
another $5,000.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.500
- You can paint over that;
that's fine.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.100
- I don't think we're supposed
to paint that wall.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
Never mind.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
- Okay, let me do Mike.

35:09.133 --> 35:10.100
- Reza!

35:10.133 --> 35:11.166
- Hold on, hold on.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.233
- I need to put
a canker sore.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.767
- You have to put big tits,
big tits too.

35:15.767 --> 35:17.767
- Look at this.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.767
- You guys, I'm fixing to
keep it just exactly like this.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.500
- I think if this sofa was gray,

35:22.500 --> 35:24.133
it would look a lot better.

35:24.133 --> 35:25.600
- Let me see.

35:25.633 --> 35:27.533
- Hey, Reza!

35:27.533 --> 35:29.633
- Sectionals are fantastic,

35:29.667 --> 35:33.367
but if you're a messy bitch
and you live in a shoe box,

35:33.400 --> 35:37.133
sectional shouldn't be
on your list of possibilities.

35:37.166 --> 35:39.233
- Look how dirty it is.

35:39.266 --> 35:40.266
- Look what he did.

35:40.266 --> 35:42.000
- Stop.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.500
[laughter]

35:43.533 --> 35:44.500
Everybody chill.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.100
Everybody just chill.

35:46.133 --> 35:48.000
- Okay, hey,
in the midst of chilling,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.133
I want to talk about something.

35:50.133 --> 35:51.600
You know, I came in, and we were
talking about Asa,

35:51.633 --> 35:53.633
and we were talking about
keeping it real

35:53.667 --> 35:55.533
and being upfront
and being honest and stuff.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.367
You know, I think it's not cool
that Asa wasn't upfront,

35:57.400 --> 35:59.533
and I don't want to be
in that same boat.

35:59.533 --> 36:02.100
And in saying that,
I got to tell you, like,

36:02.133 --> 36:05.567
yeah, I f---ed around before.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.266
- Okay.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.300
- You're admitting
that you f---ed around.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.266
- I'll admit that.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.300
Up till recently.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.166
- That was the lamest f---ing
admission I've ever heard.

36:13.166 --> 36:17.300
Like, dude, of course
you've f---ed other women.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.033
- How many times?
- While you were with Annalise?

36:19.033 --> 36:20.300
- A bunch.
- A bunch?

36:20.300 --> 36:22.033
- A bunch.
- A bunch of different girls?

36:22.066 --> 36:23.033
- Yeah.

36:23.066 --> 36:24.133
And I know I denied it before,

36:24.166 --> 36:25.433
and I'm sorry for lying to you.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.033
- You asshole.

36:27.033 --> 36:28.433
- I'm scared of commitment.

36:28.467 --> 36:30.300
- Did you tell Annalise?

36:30.333 --> 36:32.433
- No, because, you know,
it's a weird arrangement.

36:32.467 --> 36:34.633
It's like, she's all the way
on another continent, bro.

36:34.667 --> 36:38.500
- You motherf---ing
piece of sh--.

36:38.533 --> 36:40.100
Where in my life

36:40.133 --> 36:42.433
is someone not lying to me?

36:42.433 --> 36:45.266
Why is the truth
so f---ing hard?

36:45.300 --> 36:48.333
- I'm sorry,
but it's been bothering me.

36:48.333 --> 36:52.600
It's been eating me up inside.

36:52.633 --> 36:53.667
I don't want to make
any more excuses.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.333
I did it because my fault.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.667
- And because your dick
wanted you to.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.133
- Yeah, because Shervin
was swervin'.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.433
- Did you do it in your house,

37:01.467 --> 37:03.467
where she comes to
when she comes to L.A.?

37:03.500 --> 37:05.467
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

37:05.467 --> 37:06.433
- No.

37:06.467 --> 37:08.333
- Why do you have--

37:08.333 --> 37:09.600
- I go out and I party--
look, look, guys.

37:09.633 --> 37:11.400
- Let's be real.

37:11.433 --> 37:13.600
- I'm sorry if I'm not
gonna respond to nonsense.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.467
- So you f--- them
in hotel rooms?

37:15.467 --> 37:17.166
- Actually, okay,
has anybody been to my house?

37:17.200 --> 37:18.600
Yeah, sure, actually, yeah.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.166
- This is what we do;
friends talk.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.567
- Let me ask you a question.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.667
What f---ing difference
does it make where I f--- her?

37:23.700 --> 37:25.200
- We're just asking.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.467
- What difference does it make?

37:26.467 --> 37:28.200
- We're having a conversation!

37:28.200 --> 37:30.233
- On your f---ing couch,
how's that?

37:30.233 --> 37:32.233
- All I'm thinking is,
poor Annalise.

37:32.266 --> 37:34.633
Annalise is giving up
her whole life for this dude,

37:34.633 --> 37:38.233
and I always thought
he was very classy,

37:38.233 --> 37:42.200
until I saw a whole
different side of him.

37:43.367 --> 37:44.367
- What a mess.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.367
Oh, my god, look at the walls.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.433
Oh, my god.

37:47.467 --> 37:48.734
Why you did that?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.734
Please don't make
some additional damage.

37:58.667 --> 37:59.266
- She said, do you f--- them

38:00.633 --> 38:02.700
in the same bed
as you f--- Annalise?

38:02.734 --> 38:04.734
- Okay, so let me
respond to that.

38:04.767 --> 38:06.166
None of your business.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.367
- Hey, I want to say one thing,

38:07.367 --> 38:08.500
and I'm not trying
to choose sides.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.467
For a woman,
it's very important,

38:10.500 --> 38:12.533
because they feel
that's their sanctuary,

38:12.533 --> 38:15.200
the place where they
lay their head.

38:15.233 --> 38:17.500
[doorbell dings]

38:17.533 --> 38:21.200
- Ho-ho!
- Hello, how are you?

38:21.233 --> 38:22.400
- Eating pizza, huh?

38:22.433 --> 38:25.667
- Hi, Vida, joon.
- How are you?

38:25.667 --> 38:27.600
- Nice to see you again.
- You look so nice.

38:27.633 --> 38:31.200
- Look what you have done
to Mercedes' apartment.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.367
Look at the walls,
and look at this.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.400
Oh, my god, why you do that?

38:35.433 --> 38:36.667
Oh, my god!

38:36.667 --> 38:38.266
Oh, look at that.

38:38.266 --> 38:39.533
Look what a mess, look.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.533
- Mom.
- I mean, it's horrible.

38:41.533 --> 38:44.233
- One drop of paint
on this glass,

38:44.266 --> 38:46.367
that's gonna be
the end of this table.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.367
Please don't make
some additional damage.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
- We're gonna take care
of everything, don't worry.

38:51.433 --> 38:53.367
- Let's get to work.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.700
- Hey, now.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.433
- What's up?
- Tommy Boy!

38:56.433 --> 38:58.166
- They got you working, huh?
- Hey, buddy.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.166
- Looks good, babe.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.300
How you doing?

39:01.300 --> 39:02.567
- Hi, Tommy, joon!

39:02.567 --> 39:03.767
- How are you?
- What's up, buddy?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.433
- What up, Big T.
- What's up?

39:05.433 --> 39:06.533
- Oh, Shervin,
I didn't even notice you.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.000
I thought you were the help.

39:08.033 --> 39:08.700
It's coming together.

39:08.734 --> 39:10.133
It's a nice color, babe.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.300
- It's coming together?

39:11.300 --> 39:13.166
- Yeah, I'm trying
to be supportive.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.433
- Oh, my god.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.233
- Vida, joon, did you see
the ovulation sticks

39:16.266 --> 39:17.567
that were on the table?

39:17.567 --> 39:21.266
It tells her when to have sex
to get pregnant.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.300
- Are you sure you want
to have a child with Tommy?

39:23.333 --> 39:24.367
- Yes.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.567
- No, I mean, are you sure?

39:25.600 --> 39:26.767
- I'm like herpes, baby.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.400
You can't get rid of me.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.567
- Does she have your approval?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.300
- And if I have your approval,

39:31.333 --> 39:35.700
I'll be planning that wedding
together with my mom.

39:35.734 --> 39:37.200
- Yeah, Mom.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.300
Mom, I'm....

39:40.700 --> 39:41.734
- Yes.

39:41.767 --> 39:43.734
- Vida may not be cool now,

39:43.734 --> 39:46.200
but when there's a little vessel

39:46.200 --> 39:48.734
of a tiny little baby
in her arms,

39:48.734 --> 39:50.333
she'll be into it.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.333
And those are
pretty tough years.

39:52.367 --> 39:53.600
I will take the help.

39:53.633 --> 39:56.734
- If I approve,
then I'll be there for her.

39:56.734 --> 40:00.567
- But once my children become
maybe 4 or 5 years old,

40:00.600 --> 40:04.200
then we'll have to file
a restraining order.

40:04.233 --> 40:07.200
The second I get pregnant,
name your price.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.667
I will purchase your retirement.

40:09.700 --> 40:13.333
- $100,000.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.033
- All right, Mom, do you
want me to write you a check?

40:15.066 --> 40:17.233
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

40:17.233 --> 40:18.633
- Sh--, if we're
buying people out...

40:18.633 --> 40:20.567
- Hey, I have
a buyout clause.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.433
Sh--.

40:22.467 --> 40:23.633
- Mommy, joon,

40:23.633 --> 40:27.300
you will take
a $100,000 retainer.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.533
If I get pregnant,
you cash this.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.367
- I don't want
that kind of money from you.

40:39.767 --> 40:41.300
- She is so mean.

40:41.333 --> 40:42.467
- What's the matter?

40:42.500 --> 40:44.500
That wasn't even bad,
what she said.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.600
On a scale of one to Vida,
that was, like, a "V."

40:47.633 --> 40:50.033
- She's always been critical,

40:50.066 --> 40:54.300
and most people would tell me
to kick her out of my life.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.333
And I'm not gonna do that.

40:56.367 --> 40:57.533
[sobbing]

40:57.533 --> 41:01.533
- You are an emotional nut.

41:01.567 --> 41:03.633
Damn, you're beautiful.

41:07.433 --> 41:09.767
- I just feel like...

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
- How much you been drinking?

41:11.033 --> 41:13.500
- Feelings with my mom

41:13.533 --> 41:16.066
that wouldn't want me
to get pregnant.

41:16.100 --> 41:21.266
I want to expand my family,
and it's almost too late.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.333
Oh, thank god,
there's more tequila.

41:23.367 --> 41:25.667
- Oh, you're right, thank god.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.400
Thank god.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.500
- You better get me pregnant.

41:29.533 --> 41:32.667
- Yeah, I definitely can't wait
to get that person pregnant.

41:32.667 --> 41:35.400
- Merc.
- Yeah, yes.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.000
- What are you guys
doing in there?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.667
- Just weeping.

41:38.667 --> 41:41.033
- Everybody's making fun
of every emotion that I have.

41:41.033 --> 41:42.567
Vida should be down.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.767
- Reza, joon, bye-bye,
got to go.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.433
- Bye, Vida, joon.
- Bye-bye.

41:47.467 --> 41:49.433
- Mercedes, what are you doing,
crying?

41:49.433 --> 41:50.767
- You shouldn't
make fun of me, Mom.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.433
It's not cool.

41:52.467 --> 41:55.166
- I don't want $100,000
from my daughter.

41:55.166 --> 41:58.133
- Everybody has to really
support me.

41:58.166 --> 41:59.767
It's not gonna be a joke.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.400
- Merc, I swear to god,
no one is not supporting you.

42:02.433 --> 42:03.433
- Bye-bye, everybody.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.033
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:05.033 --> 42:06.567
- Listen, babe,
your mother's not Donna Reed.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.033
We already know
that she's not Donna Reed.

42:08.033 --> 42:09.000
- Who's Donna Reed?

42:09.033 --> 42:10.133
- Donna Reed.

42:10.166 --> 42:11.667
It's like
the quintessential mom.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.567
- Are you sure that you want
to get pregnant too?

42:13.567 --> 42:16.500
- Yeah, babe, yeah.

42:16.533 --> 42:18.367
I just don't think it's as easy

42:18.400 --> 42:20.133
as you just saying,
"I want to be pregnant."

42:20.166 --> 42:22.333
We both have to make
preparations to be parents.

42:22.367 --> 42:24.333
- Are you saying
that you want to have a baby,

42:24.367 --> 42:25.533
or you're not ready?

42:25.567 --> 42:26.700
- I'm saying
that we need to prepare.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.066
- You're not ready, then.

42:28.066 --> 42:32.600
- You're not ready.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.600
- No.
- Okay.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.333
- All you have to do
is get pregnant.

42:36.333 --> 42:40.033
- People typically do
at 20 years old, not at 40.

42:40.066 --> 42:41.066
- Just give her a hug.

42:41.066 --> 42:44.734
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:44.734 --> 42:46.600
- Come here.

42:46.633 --> 42:51.000
- [crying]

42:51.033 --> 42:52.700
- Come here, baby,
what are you getting mad about?

42:52.734 --> 42:54.433
- No, I don't want
to talk to you.

42:54.467 --> 42:56.433
- Okay.
- Please get away from me.

43:00.734 --> 43:02.166
- I think that there's
more preparations

43:02.200 --> 43:03.500
that we need to make as a couple

43:03.533 --> 43:04.734
before we're ready
to have a baby.

43:04.767 --> 43:06.500
- Okay, that's very adult
of you.

43:06.533 --> 43:09.600
- Merc, he just has doubts--

43:09.633 --> 43:12.033
- I know, but he wants
to get there.

43:12.066 --> 43:15.100
- I don't care about any
of his reasons!

43:15.100 --> 43:17.633
- I just feel like she feels
like she has a gun to her head,

43:17.667 --> 43:19.200
because her father's real sick.

43:19.233 --> 43:20.600
She's told me
on numerous occasions,

43:20.633 --> 43:22.100
"I want him
to hold my baby."

43:22.100 --> 43:23.633
Okay, then what?

43:23.633 --> 43:26.367
- I will f--- a f---ing pimp.

43:26.367 --> 43:27.767
I will f---ing do this.

43:27.767 --> 43:30.066
I will go get pregnant
by an ex.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.467
I don't care.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.700
- And you know...
- Merc, I know you.

43:32.734 --> 43:34.367
- That I have somebody
that is willing.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.734
- No sh--, I know.

43:35.767 --> 43:37.100
- Okay, and you know what?

43:37.100 --> 43:39.633
He should be down
on all f---ing fours

43:39.667 --> 43:41.767
so that he can beg
to be the father.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.066
That's where I'm at right now.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.233
- I'm not a healthy guy.

43:45.266 --> 43:46.767
I've smoked cigarettes,
I drink.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.533
She's not real healthy either.

43:48.567 --> 43:50.533
The thing that terrifies me
more than anything in life

43:50.533 --> 43:52.000
is to leave a baby
without a parent.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.066
It's happened to me.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.066
You know what I'm saying?

43:54.100 --> 43:55.066
She's 40 years old.

43:55.100 --> 43:56.767
I was 13.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.467
You know, my mom died of cancer
from smoking cigarettes,

43:59.500 --> 44:01.000
and she loved to have
a drink or two.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
So I want us
to be a lot more healthy.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
I don't want to not be there
for any kid I have.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.533
You know, I remember finding out
that she died,

44:10.533 --> 44:15.633
and not crying,
and feeling like the worst...

44:15.667 --> 44:17.567
worst person.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.266
I love her,
and I miss her every day.

44:31.300 --> 44:32.767
- It's now or never.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.667
You want to have cold feet
with this bitch?

44:34.700 --> 44:36.166
- Merc, Merc,
you're overreacting.

44:36.166 --> 44:37.500
- You're having cold feet
with the wrong bitch.

44:37.533 --> 44:38.700
- No one's having cold feet.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.133
- Yes, he is.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.767
- It's now or never.
- Now or never?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.133
- You hear one f---ing word
I just told you?

44:47.166 --> 44:49.033
- You're an asshole.
- Then it's never.

44:53.066 --> 44:53.367
- It's now or never.

44:55.300 --> 44:56.700
You want to have cold feet
with this bitch?

44:56.700 --> 44:58.166
- Merc, Merc...

44:58.200 --> 44:59.633
- You want to have cold feet
with this bitch?

44:59.667 --> 45:00.700
- You're overreacting right now.

45:00.734 --> 45:01.700
- You're having...

45:01.734 --> 45:03.266
- Merc, you're overreacting.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.000
- You're having cold feet
with the wrong bitch.

45:05.033 --> 45:06.633
- No one's having cold feet.
- Yes, he is.

45:06.667 --> 45:09.033
- You know, is this really
a great place to raise a baby?

45:09.066 --> 45:10.700
I mean, this looks
like downtown Baghdad.

45:10.734 --> 45:12.467
- These are all excuses.

45:12.467 --> 45:14.033
The chances
of ever having a child

45:14.066 --> 45:17.133
are getting less and less
every f---ing month,

45:17.166 --> 45:18.200
every year that you wait.

45:18.233 --> 45:20.200
- Tommy.
- Yes, buddy?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.200
- Please come here right now.
- Absolutely.

45:22.233 --> 45:25.600
- You've made your girl
very uncomfortable and upset.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.033
Please talk to her,

45:27.066 --> 45:29.066
and make her not
be uncomfortable,

45:29.066 --> 45:30.200
and make her not be upset.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.734
- Everything's perfect.

45:31.767 --> 45:33.200
- I don't understand
what you're so upset about.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.233
- So, are you ready
to get pregnant?

45:41.700 --> 45:43.133
- I'm not, no, no.

45:43.166 --> 45:44.133
You're not either.

45:44.166 --> 45:45.133
- I am.

45:45.166 --> 45:46.567
- No, you think you are.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.133
Just because you say
the words doesn't mean--

45:48.166 --> 45:49.633
Babe, how many shots
did you have today?

45:49.633 --> 45:51.166
- It doesn't have anything--

45:51.200 --> 45:52.734
- Yeah, it doesn't have
anything to do with it?

45:52.767 --> 45:53.767
Has nothing to do with it?

45:53.767 --> 45:55.233
- No.
- Really?

45:55.233 --> 45:57.333
- Okay, f---, I drink.

45:57.367 --> 45:58.734
Big f---ing deal.

45:58.767 --> 46:00.767
- We need to both
make better preparations.

46:00.767 --> 46:04.100
- I'm gonna get pregnant
by another man.

46:04.133 --> 46:05.367
- Slow down.

46:05.367 --> 46:07.367
- Okay, I'll go slow
now by leaving.

46:07.367 --> 46:09.633
- All right, that's not gonna
make things any better.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.700
- You're with a woman
of a certain age

46:11.734 --> 46:13.467
that got her eggs frozen,

46:13.500 --> 46:16.500
and you have the nerve
to say you're not sure?

46:16.533 --> 46:19.567
This is equivalent
to lying to me.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.734
I swear to god, I'm never
gonna talk to him again.

46:21.767 --> 46:23.233
- Merc, come on.

46:23.266 --> 46:25.233
- I've never
wanted kids before.

46:25.233 --> 46:26.633
I haven't.

46:26.633 --> 46:28.166
And it sounds
like I don't want them know.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.633
And that's not the case.

46:29.633 --> 46:31.633
There's never been any person
I met in my life

46:31.667 --> 46:33.667
where I want more to have a baby
than with her.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.266
I just want to make sure
that we're doing it

46:35.266 --> 46:36.600
for the right reasons.

46:36.633 --> 46:38.133
It's about me,
you know what I mean?

46:38.133 --> 46:40.100
Her mom didn't die,
her father didn't die.

46:40.133 --> 46:41.100
Mine did.

46:41.133 --> 46:42.266
If we do have a baby,

46:42.300 --> 46:43.633
I want to make sure
that that baby

46:43.667 --> 46:45.000
never wants for nothing.

46:45.033 --> 46:46.600
I'm talking about, from love.

46:46.633 --> 46:48.066
- Which is wonderful.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.133
- There's nothing like someone
like your mom

46:50.133 --> 46:52.000
just telling you
it's gonna be all right.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.133
You know, today was a bad day--

46:53.133 --> 46:56.367
[crying]

46:56.400 --> 46:58.367
- Oh, my god.

47:02.133 --> 47:05.533
Tommy, joon.

47:05.567 --> 47:09.533
- There's been so many nights
that I've gone to bed alone.

47:09.567 --> 47:13.033
Felt alone,
and woke up alone.

47:13.066 --> 47:15.300
And I just--
I don't ever want that.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.667
It's the worst thing on earth.

47:22.667 --> 47:24.133
- What's up, pretty girl?

47:24.166 --> 47:26.033
- Hey, you been crying?
- Yeah, a little bit.

47:26.066 --> 47:27.166
- For whom?

47:28.700 --> 47:30.000
- For whom?

47:30.033 --> 47:31.567
- You guys,
this is the perfect time

47:31.567 --> 47:34.166
for us to check out
and allow you guys some space.

47:34.166 --> 47:35.667
We love you guys.

47:35.700 --> 47:37.100
Make some babies.

47:39.166 --> 47:40.233
- MJ.

47:42.433 --> 47:43.633
- Okay.

47:51.033 --> 47:53.367
- Tell her what it is,

47:53.400 --> 47:55.133
or else she's gonna
get really defensive.

47:55.166 --> 47:56.734
- I'm gonna f---ing walk away.

47:56.734 --> 47:59.734
Whatever the f--- you said
that was vulnerable,

47:59.734 --> 48:01.266
just say right now.

48:10.734 --> 48:12.200
- I need to make sure

48:12.200 --> 48:14.333
that what you're talking about
is real.

48:14.367 --> 48:16.400
- Why would I lie
to you, babe?

48:16.433 --> 48:18.600
- Clearly, you haven't
been honest with me before.

48:18.633 --> 48:20.300
- I've been nothing
but honest with you.

48:20.333 --> 48:22.166
- Well,
let me close this door.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.600
- Anything I told you
hasn't changed.

48:23.633 --> 48:25.200
- So this conversation
doesn't have to be

48:25.200 --> 48:28.066
part of the entire
apartment complex.

48:28.100 --> 48:30.033
- Anything I've told you
hasn't changed.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.266
I've had my reservations
from day one.

48:32.300 --> 48:33.734
I, uh--

48:33.734 --> 48:35.200
- You've had
your reservations?

48:35.200 --> 48:36.233
- Yeah.

48:36.233 --> 48:37.233
- Listen, just let him talk.

48:37.233 --> 48:39.100
Just let him talk, really quick.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.734
- I mean, all I want to
make sure is that we're ready.

48:40.767 --> 48:42.200
I want to make sure
that we're good parents.

48:42.233 --> 48:44.200
I want to make sure
that we're both healthy.

48:44.233 --> 48:47.066
You know, I grew up
without anybody.

48:47.100 --> 48:48.767
I watched my mom die.

48:48.767 --> 48:50.767
I didn't have somebody to
tell me it's gonna be all right.

48:50.767 --> 48:52.767
"Tomorrow's a better day,"
I didn't have that.

48:52.767 --> 48:54.433
I've ran my whole life
from it,

48:54.467 --> 48:58.233
because there's no more
lonely feeling in the world

48:58.233 --> 48:59.767
when you have a great day

48:59.767 --> 49:02.333
and you have no one
to tell about it,

49:02.367 --> 49:06.233
and you have a sh---y day
and no one to tell about it.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.166
- So I'm not that person?

49:10.200 --> 49:13.367
- It has nothing--no, we need
to be that for someone else.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.200
It's not you,
and it's not me.

49:15.233 --> 49:17.100
It's more important
than both of us.

49:17.133 --> 49:19.400
- Oh, so are we that
for each other?

49:19.433 --> 49:21.367
- I hope so,
but that doesn't mean

49:21.400 --> 49:23.000
that you're gonna
be a good mom.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.367
It doesn't mean I'm gonna be
a good dad.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.734
It doesn't mean
that we're ready.

49:25.767 --> 49:27.000
It doesn't mean
that we're prepared,

49:27.033 --> 49:28.333
because we love each other.

49:28.367 --> 49:31.400
- You're saying that,
because of your mom,

49:31.433 --> 49:34.266
God rest her soul,

49:34.266 --> 49:37.133
that I'm not gonna be there
for my kid?

49:37.166 --> 49:39.467
Or you're not gonna be there
for your kid?

49:39.500 --> 49:42.667
- I'm saying that I want to
make sure we're here for them.

49:42.700 --> 49:44.767
- Okay, what do you need
for that?

49:45.000 --> 49:46.233
- For us both to be healthy.

49:46.266 --> 49:49.133
- Your mom died;
my mom's dying.

49:49.133 --> 49:50.266
You need to make sure

49:50.300 --> 49:52.266
that one of us
needs to not die?

49:52.300 --> 49:53.767
- No, I need us
to be prepared.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.400
- I need you not to f---ing
be full of sh--.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.467
- Stop yelling.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.133
This is what I'm talking about.

49:58.166 --> 50:00.166
Stop yelling; I'm not trying
to make this a fight.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.433
I was just real and honest--

50:01.433 --> 50:03.166
- I'm the screamer?
- I was just--

50:03.200 --> 50:04.300
- You're right, babe, forget it.

50:04.333 --> 50:06.033
- You're right.
- Yes.

50:06.066 --> 50:08.300
- Let's forget it, no problem.

50:08.300 --> 50:11.000
Because I'd rather
have a baby...

50:11.033 --> 50:12.433
- Yeah, with some stranger.

50:12.433 --> 50:15.266
- With someone who says
it's okay to have a problem.

50:15.300 --> 50:16.400
- Got it, this is definitely
the right way.

50:16.433 --> 50:17.433
- It's now or never.

50:17.433 --> 50:19.300
- See, now or never?

50:19.300 --> 50:22.166
All right, did you hear one
f---ing word I just told you?

50:22.166 --> 50:23.767
- This is the biggest betrayal.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.033
I don't want a fearful man.

50:27.033 --> 50:28.567
- No, cool,
then it's never.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.166
Then it's never,
then it's never, got it.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.166
- You're an asshole
who screams a lot.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.433
- I'm an asshole, thanks.

50:34.433 --> 50:38.567
- That wants to find a side door
to skate out of.

50:38.567 --> 50:42.333
I need somebody that's
a little bit stronger than this.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.166
- Yeah, I'm not...

50:44.200 --> 50:47.066
I'm not gonna continue
to have this conversation.

50:47.066 --> 50:50.066
- I'm gonna be
the most amazing mother.

50:50.066 --> 50:52.200
So the fact
that you're sitting here

50:52.200 --> 50:54.333
to f---ing humiliate me...

50:54.367 --> 50:56.066
- What?

50:56.066 --> 50:58.200
- While you're not doing
a goddamn f---ing thing.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.333
You smoke a hundred cigarettes.

51:00.333 --> 51:01.533
- No sh--, no sh--.

51:01.567 --> 51:02.600
- You, right now,

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
need to be about your truth

51:04.600 --> 51:07.467
that says, "You know what,
Mercedes Javid,

51:07.467 --> 51:11.066
"even though I f---ing
hit you up on Tinder

51:11.066 --> 51:13.433
"and we f---ed
and we moved in together,

51:13.467 --> 51:15.166
"and I bent down on one knee,

51:15.200 --> 51:18.266
I'm actually full of sh--."

51:23.633 --> 51:24.100
- You need to be

51:24.100 --> 51:24.467
- You need to be
about your truth that says,

51:27.233 --> 51:29.767
"I'm actually full of sh--."

51:30.000 --> 51:31.433
- Yeah, I'm full of sh--, why?

51:31.467 --> 51:33.633
Because I want to make sure
we're good parents?

51:33.633 --> 51:35.300
You're right,
I'm a piece of sh--,

51:35.333 --> 51:36.367
and I'm a liar.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.100
You're right, you're right.

51:38.100 --> 51:39.567
- It's a good time
for you to bow out.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.433
- Yes, yes.

51:41.467 --> 51:43.100
- It's getting a little too hot
in this room for you.

51:43.133 --> 51:44.633
- No, I'm not gonna listen
to the nonsense.

51:44.633 --> 51:46.633
- Of course it's nonsense
when I'm making a point.

51:46.633 --> 51:48.633
- You didn't listen to one thing
I just told you.

51:48.633 --> 51:50.333
You pissed on it.

51:50.367 --> 51:52.367
You took it and threw it
on the floor like, "Dah!"

51:52.367 --> 51:55.367
That does not make me say,
"Let's have a baby."

51:55.367 --> 51:58.100
All your feelings don't matter.

51:58.133 --> 51:59.633
- No, you're not.

51:59.633 --> 52:02.233
Tommy, if you said,

52:02.266 --> 52:05.533
"I, Tommy, have quit smoking;

52:05.567 --> 52:08.533
you, MJ, continue to drink,"

52:08.533 --> 52:11.400
then you'd have
a f---ing leg to stand on.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.467
- No, you had
ten f---ing shots today.

52:13.500 --> 52:14.467
What's your point?

52:14.500 --> 52:15.533
- Accountability.

52:15.533 --> 52:17.100
- Okay, so tell me your point.

52:17.133 --> 52:18.266
I would love to hear this.

52:18.266 --> 52:21.066
- I'll repeat it.
- Okay, please.

52:21.100 --> 52:22.633
- Now you're in a pickle,

52:22.667 --> 52:25.066
and you have two choices:

52:25.100 --> 52:27.533
sh-- or get off the pot.

52:27.533 --> 52:30.266
I opt that you
get off the pot.

52:30.300 --> 52:33.133
Never f---ing call me again,
or anything.

52:33.166 --> 52:34.266
- Got it, no problem.

52:34.266 --> 52:35.266
- Just bounce.

52:35.266 --> 52:36.533
- MJ, why?

52:36.533 --> 52:38.133
- No problem,
let's have seven kids.

52:38.133 --> 52:39.400
- In my life,

52:39.400 --> 52:41.467
all I see is a bunch
of f---ing liars.

52:41.500 --> 52:43.233
- Let's have 17, right.

52:43.266 --> 52:45.200
- I'm gonna get pregnant
by somebody within half an hour.

52:45.233 --> 52:46.567
- Bye.
- You told me that already.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.633
- No, this was not
how it was supposed to go down.

52:48.667 --> 52:50.400
Tommy.

52:50.433 --> 52:54.633
- You want to start with
Shervin, Michael, Reza, Tommy?

52:54.667 --> 52:59.166
Which one of them
can hold a candle to my dad?

52:59.166 --> 53:00.300
- Whatever, man.

53:00.333 --> 53:02.100
Go have a baby
with whoever, then.

53:02.133 --> 53:03.233
- MJ.

53:03.266 --> 53:04.667
- Lock that door,
lock that door.

53:04.700 --> 53:07.300
Thank god for my dad,

53:07.300 --> 53:12.300
because, you know what,
I still have him.

53:12.300 --> 53:13.367
So...

53:16.433 --> 53:20.500
Lesson of the day:

53:20.533 --> 53:22.567
Don't get fooled by the weak.

53:22.567 --> 53:25.033
What the f---?

53:25.066 --> 53:26.166
[door slams]

53:26.166 --> 53:28.467
- Next on "Shahs of Sunset."

53:28.500 --> 53:29.734
- This is the judgment.

53:29.734 --> 53:31.266
You're keeping
what's in your name.

53:31.300 --> 53:32.467
She's keeping
what's in her name.

53:32.467 --> 53:34.600
I just need you
to sign here.

53:34.600 --> 53:37.166
- We're going to New York,
bitches!

53:37.200 --> 53:38.300
- We're in New York.

53:38.333 --> 53:40.567
- Rabbi, we met
with a surrogacy doctor.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.533
- My partner and I did this
six years ago.

53:42.567 --> 53:44.467
- Why did you choose
surrogacy?

53:44.467 --> 53:47.333
- For Jews, the body
is a meaningful space.

53:47.367 --> 53:49.333
- How is Jessica?
- She's cool.

53:49.367 --> 53:52.166
- It just feels like
there's more there.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.333
- I'm always gonna love her.

53:53.333 --> 53:55.133
It's not something
I just switch off.

53:55.166 --> 53:57.667
- I can turn up,
believe me, motherf---er!

53:57.700 --> 53:59.467
Any of these
motherf---ing people!

53:59.500 --> 54:00.467
You want to turn up?

54:00.500 --> 54:01.734
Come on, bring it, bitch!

54:01.734 --> 54:04.700
- For more "Shahs of Sunset,"
go to:
