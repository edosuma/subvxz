I know I can.

Only on Fox.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.555
*

00:36.537 --> 00:38.706
Ana?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.110
What are you doing here?

00:43.711 --> 00:44.945
Waiting for you.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.715
Wait, that's...
that's not possible.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.486
God, it's been 22 years.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.756
You're not my sister.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.429
Why did you leave Punia?

01:02.896 --> 01:06.400
When the cardinal found me
on the streets...

01:06.434 --> 01:09.270
it was my chance
to escape this life.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.573
Get an education,
become something more.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.242
I had to take it.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.613
You said you would come back.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.315
I did.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.819
I tried.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.989
I couldn't find you, I was...

01:29.022 --> 01:30.891
I was too late.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.893
(sighs)

01:32.926 --> 01:36.330
I... I waited for you.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.676
I'm so sorry, Ana.

01:55.983 --> 01:59.320
I'm just glad you're back.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.295
(exhales, sniffles)

02:08.196 --> 02:10.664
I won't leave you.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.466
Ever again.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.879
PRIEST: And you're sure
he's the best candidate?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.348
The Office of Exorcism

02:27.381 --> 02:30.351
has been a stain on our faith
for far too long.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.320
I can think of
no one more suited

02:32.353 --> 02:35.623
to do the convincing
than Father Bennett.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.427
Assuming he returns to us with
the proper... temperament.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.695
And how are we doing tonight?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.431
VATICAN OFFICIAL:
Fine, thank you.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.336
You ask me, I think your friend
is gonna wake up soon.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.337
Is that right?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.038
I was in here earlier

02:51.071 --> 02:53.974
and I'm pretty sure I heard him
talking in his sleep.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.676
Praise the Lord.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.892
(hissing, demonic whispers)

03:22.035 --> 03:24.204
(grunts)

03:32.546 --> 03:34.948
(grunts)

03:36.317 --> 03:38.452
(panting)

03:44.258 --> 03:46.494
Took you long enough.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.304
Hello, Marcus.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.314
*

04:16.524 --> 04:18.225
Are you gonna talk to her,

04:18.258 --> 04:19.727
or just keep brooding?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.761
What's she even doing here?

04:20.794 --> 04:24.164
She was at the house
when I woke up.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.666
I came with Bennett to find you.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.435
I don't see him anywhere.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.404
I left him in a hospital
outside of Spokane.

04:30.438 --> 04:33.674
He was injured by your friend,
Maria Walters.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.743
Is he all right?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.077
You saw Maria?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.246
Saw her die.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.014
You're welcome, by the way.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.650
Miserable creature.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.818
Still doesn't answer
my question.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.988
Why are you here?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.358
The Church has been compromised.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.627
Every exorcist is being
recalled from the field.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.129
They're hunting down
the ones that resist--

04:56.163 --> 04:57.598
turning or killing them.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.267
Not what I'm asking.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.670
You, Mouse.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.038
-Why are you here?
-MOUSE: I don't need permission

05:05.072 --> 05:07.675
from you, or the Church.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.210
You lost the right
to tell me what to do

05:10.243 --> 05:12.513
-when you walked out that door.
-You were in good hands.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.215
I should have been
in your hands.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.284
I was in Hell, Marcus.
For six months.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.520
And you just left me there.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.690
I fought to save you.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.892
Day and night.
Everything I had,

05:24.925 --> 05:27.395
everything inside me,
it wasn't enough.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.896
I wasn't enough.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.031
You needed help
that I wasn't fit to give.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.335
I needed you.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.040
(whispers): I never wanted
this life for you.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.844
We have no time for this.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.879
You sent the kids off the island
to find help.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.648
That means people will
come looking for us.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.451
We'll do what we can
in the time we've got left.

06:00.928 --> 06:04.832
What a lovely day
for an exorcism.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.667
(laughing)

06:06.700 --> 06:08.802
(thunder rumbles)

06:31.592 --> 06:33.427
Is there, like, some...

06:33.461 --> 06:37.297
stupid Bible verse
I can say or something?

06:37.330 --> 06:38.899
You mean, like a prayer?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.869
Like whatever.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.704
I just...

06:43.737 --> 06:46.574
I need to do something.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.543
You could start
by asking God for help.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.580
Does it matter if I don't...

06:52.613 --> 06:55.749
exactly, totally believe?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.218
No.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.687
No, it doesn't matter.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.243
MARCUS:
Whoever dwells in

07:23.276 --> 07:24.311
the shelter of the Most High

07:24.344 --> 07:26.313
-will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty. -(growls)

07:26.346 --> 07:27.915
I will say of the Lord,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.283
"He is my refuge
and my fortress,

07:30.317 --> 07:32.119
-my God, in whom I trust."
-Surely He will save you...

07:32.152 --> 07:33.754
-(snarls) -...from
the fowler's snare and from

07:33.787 --> 07:35.756
the deadly pestilence. He will
cover you with His feathers,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.858
and under His wings
you will find refuge.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.760
-You will not fear the terror
of the night... -(yowls)

07:39.793 --> 07:41.161
...nor the arrow
that flies by day!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.535
(panting)

07:47.568 --> 07:49.770
(demonic panting)

07:49.803 --> 07:51.471
Nor the pestilence
that stalks in the darkness,

07:51.505 --> 07:54.041
nor the plague
that destroys at midday.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.809
MARCUS/MOUSE: A thousand may
fall at your side,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.612
10,000 at your right hand,

07:58.646 --> 08:00.113
but it will not come near you.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.182
-TOMAS: They will lift you up
in their hands... -(groans)

08:02.215 --> 08:04.952
...so that you will not strike
your foot against a stone.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.954
You will tread on the lion
and the cobra.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.790
-You will trample the great lion
and the serpent. -(growls)

08:09.823 --> 08:11.391
"Because he loves me,"
says the Lord.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.894
-"I will rescue him. I will
protect him, -(boards creaking)

08:13.927 --> 08:16.997
because he acknowledges
my name."

08:17.030 --> 08:19.032
-He will call on me and I will
answer him. -(screams)

08:19.066 --> 08:22.169
With long life,
I will satisfy him,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.171
and show him my salvation!

08:24.204 --> 08:27.007
(demonic screaming)

08:42.355 --> 08:44.892
(laughs)

08:48.195 --> 08:50.330
This one's strong.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.965
We're running out of time.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.139
(helicopter blades whirring)

09:03.410 --> 09:06.013
How long until they find us?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.414
Doesn't matter.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.782
We keep working.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.217
You're making a mistake.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.586
What do you think's gonna happen
when the police show up?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.723
Get yourself arrested
and the enemy wins.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.126
(gun cocks)
I can't allow that.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.564
Well, this is new.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.934
-What are you doing? -MOUSE:
What you should have done

09:26.967 --> 09:29.737
a long time ago: kill the host,
kill the demon.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.238
You've lost him either way.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.707
At least this way
we save his soul.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.542
Put the gun down.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.612
Tell me I'm wrong.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.589
We're exorcists...

09:51.491 --> 09:53.093
...not executioners.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.006
ANDY:
I know a priest

10:06.039 --> 10:09.309
in Chicago
who would beg to differ.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.613
Slit his throat from ear to ear.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.984
What's he talking about?

10:17.017 --> 10:20.520
It was an integrated demon;
it left me no other choice.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.156
There's always a choice.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.760
Every kill I've made,
every finger on the trigger,

10:26.794 --> 10:30.163
every hand closing around
a little throat,

10:30.197 --> 10:34.634
it all came down
to that one choice.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.337
That's what makes it all
so tasty.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.140
Don't listen to it.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.775
I'm not.

10:41.809 --> 10:45.946
You act like Brother Simon
was the first,

10:45.979 --> 10:49.850
but his is not the face you see
when you close your eyes.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.620
(as Marcus's father):
Where are yeh, Marky-boy?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.823
I know you're in here.

10:55.856 --> 10:59.026
My dad was a mad dog.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.394
I did what needed to be done.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.131
You tell yourself that.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.467
But your mum were long dead,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.738
and the door right there.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.973
You could have run.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.374
You could have gone for help.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.945
You chose to take that gun
off the wall.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.082
That's why it haunts you.

11:22.115 --> 11:26.486
Not because you regret it,
but because you enjoyed it.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.689
It makes you wonder
if that violence in your heart

11:29.723 --> 11:32.492
was always there.

11:32.525 --> 11:37.564
Or if it gets passed
from one generation to the next.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.900
(whispers):
You know something?

11:42.535 --> 11:46.073
You're the first one
that ever got that right.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.610
Lucky me.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.913
MOUSE:
My question is,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.681
why is it still here?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.249
It failed to kill the family,

11:56.283 --> 11:58.518
it knows it can't beat
all three of us,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.287
so why hasn't it left?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.255
Because of Andy.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.859
He's trapping it
inside the body,

12:05.893 --> 12:08.728
holding it in place
until we kill it.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.430
So then we honor
his last request.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.933
Destroy the demon
while we still have a chance.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.701
But you're talking about murder.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.270
We don't have time
to finish the exorcism.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.273
And Andy can't keep holding
that thing back forever.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.976
-It will escape.
-There is another way.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.116
We offer something
it wants even more.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.920
(whispers):
Bait.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.957
Absolutely not.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.126
The demon let me in once before.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.962
The only way it's going
to release its hold on Andy

12:41.995 --> 12:43.730
is if a better host comes along.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.232
You've said it yourself--

12:45.265 --> 12:47.734
there's no higher prize
than an exorcist.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.236
You're talking
about a suicide run.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.472
I am talking about saving Andy.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.640
Andy's still in there.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.843
I saw him, I spoke with him.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.778
Even if there's a chance
we can save him...

12:58.812 --> 13:00.247
You let that thing
inside your head,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.949
you're not coming back out.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.152
...even the slightest chance,
we have to take it.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.587
You taught me that, Marcus.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.490
We go to the ends of the earth.
We bring them back.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.092
Nothing else matters.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.962
It'll take your soul, Tomas.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.765
It'll destroy you.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.368
It was my fault Andy escaped.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.472
It was my fault
I let the demons in.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.042
I need to make things right.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.778
What, by throwing your life
away?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.147
My life belongs to God.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.152
It has always been in His hands.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.024
I don't want to lose you.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.364
Then bring me back.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.149
No, this is madness.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.317
Just let him do it.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.319
Tomas, stop.
He's not worth it.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.854
Don't listen to her, priest.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.556
It's just you...

14:16.589 --> 14:18.258
and me.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.928
You can feel it, can't you?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.996
Scratching at the back
of your mind.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.865
Like little claws,
skritch, scratch.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.035
Waiting to come in.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.539
All you have to do
is say the word.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.009
You want me?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.445
Come and get me.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.447
(seething breaths)

14:55.495 --> 14:57.430
(floor creaks softly)

14:57.464 --> 14:59.566
*

15:07.507 --> 15:09.076
(gasps)

15:11.911 --> 15:13.113
(clattering upstairs)

15:20.453 --> 15:22.622
*

15:27.527 --> 15:29.296
(loud clattering)

15:57.224 --> 15:59.192
(loud clattering)

16:08.868 --> 16:12.005
(demonic whispers)

16:19.979 --> 16:24.617
(overlapping voices)

16:24.651 --> 16:27.487
(growling)

16:32.525 --> 16:34.727
(panting)

16:34.761 --> 16:36.129
Andy.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.630
We have to hurry.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.800
It won't be gone long;
it never is. Come on.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.635
To the bedroom.
The bedroom.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.504
(Tomas panting)

16:48.708 --> 16:50.410
(panting)

16:53.680 --> 16:58.518
Every time I kill it,
it comes back a little stronger.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.021
We're getting you out of here.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.923
(whispers):
No.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.025
I can't leave.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.696
People are dead, Father.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.468
Russ and Colleen,
Harper's mom.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.740
Because I brought this thing
into our lives.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.575
I let it hurt Rose...

17:22.609 --> 17:25.678
(whispers):
and the children.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.747
How am I supposed
to live with myself?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.019
How can they ever forgive me?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.155
You might be surprised.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.127
If I leave...

17:40.160 --> 17:42.595
the demon runs...

17:45.965 --> 17:48.067
...with some other family.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.537
We have to kill it.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.039
(rumbling)

17:53.072 --> 17:54.741
Father.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.312
-If this goes wrong...
-No, no, no, it won't.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.684
(whispers):
But if it does...

18:07.187 --> 18:09.722
...I want you
to take back a message

18:09.756 --> 18:11.624
for the kids.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.397
(whispers):
Say what you have to say.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.467
MOUSE:
You could have stopped him.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.635
You don't know my partner.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.737
I know you're wasting
his talent.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.473
God sent you an atom bomb,

18:26.506 --> 18:29.276
and you're trying to turn him
into a surgeon's scalpel.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.079
Thing about bombs, they explode,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.915
destroying themselves
and everything around them.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.252
Only if we're not there to
protect him, show him the way.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.587
What do you think
I've been doing?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.790
The old way doesn't work
anymore, Marcus.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.927
How long does it take
to save a single soul?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.496
Weeks. Months.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.166
And in that time, the enemy
takes a hundred more hosts.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.034
-I'm aware.
-Are you?

18:55.067 --> 18:58.271
You asked me why I came.

18:58.305 --> 19:02.108
I came because we're losing,

19:02.141 --> 19:04.110
and I don't know
what else to do.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.712
And if there's a chance

19:05.745 --> 19:09.882
that his gift can help turn
the tide, we need to take it.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.858
(loud clattering)

19:26.366 --> 19:28.501
I don't see anything.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.206
(clattering in distance)

19:36.343 --> 19:38.177
(clattering)

19:39.178 --> 19:41.514
(clattering)

19:50.089 --> 19:51.591
(door creaking)

20:02.769 --> 20:04.537
(floor creaking)

20:07.740 --> 20:09.876
You ever have
one of those dreams

20:09.909 --> 20:12.545
you feel like
you can't wake up from?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.850
That'd be nice, huh?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.553
If this was all a dream?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.623
Yeah.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.959
-(yells)
-Andy!

20:26.993 --> 20:30.029
(screaming)

20:30.062 --> 20:32.265
*

20:36.002 --> 20:37.304
(gasps)

20:37.337 --> 20:39.472
(demonic growling)

20:42.141 --> 20:42.975
(gasps)

20:48.515 --> 20:50.417
-(cracking)
-(shouts)

20:57.990 --> 20:59.892
(pounding)

20:59.926 --> 21:01.761
ANDY:
That won't work.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.297
Andy.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.334
(pounding)

21:08.301 --> 21:10.537
I can't hold her back anymore.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.974
-Andy.
-(weakly): She's too strong.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.281
You don't have to fight anymore.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.417
It's my turn.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.753
What do you mean?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.288
If I offer myself to the demon,

21:29.322 --> 21:31.891
it will let you go.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.098
No.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.934
That wasn't part of the deal.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.770
I'm changing the deal.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.772
(pounding)

21:45.805 --> 21:47.306
Go home, Andy.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.041
Be with your kids.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.778
It's my...

21:51.811 --> 21:54.614
mistake.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.115
(groans)

21:56.148 --> 21:57.717
It's my responsibility.

21:57.750 --> 22:01.320
(pounding)

22:01.354 --> 22:03.322
No.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.159
We cast you out...

22:07.193 --> 22:08.661
every unclean spirit,

22:08.695 --> 22:11.964
-(pounding, clattering)
-every satanic power...

22:11.998 --> 22:16.068
every onslaught
of the infernal adversary.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.571
(praying in Spanish)

22:37.557 --> 22:40.026
(Tomas continues praying softly)

22:42.695 --> 22:45.832
...driven from this good man.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.001
From his soul, made in the image
and likeness of God,

22:49.035 --> 22:53.440
and redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine lamb!

22:53.473 --> 22:55.074
Any onslaught

22:55.107 --> 22:56.342
of the infernal adversary.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.078
We cast you out!

23:10.457 --> 23:12.592
ANDY:
Father.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.545
(demonic voice):
Hello, Father.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.815
Let him go.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.250
Take me instead.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.888
With pleasure.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.222
No!

23:43.255 --> 23:45.592
MOUSE:
Something's wrong.

23:47.494 --> 23:51.598
Tomas. Tomas. Tomas!

23:53.933 --> 23:56.168
Bloody Tomas,
I need you to wake up.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.470
Wake up!

23:58.437 --> 24:00.006
(Tomas gasping)

24:02.374 --> 24:05.478
-(yells)
-(growling)

24:05.512 --> 24:07.747
MARCUS:
Get out of there.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.783
Tomas. Tomas, get out of there!

24:10.817 --> 24:13.052
MOUSE:
We're losing him.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.590
Marcus!

24:17.624 --> 24:20.527
If you can hear me, shoot her!

24:21.661 --> 24:23.830
(demonic yelling)

24:24.997 --> 24:26.866
Shoot her now!

24:26.899 --> 24:27.967
Tomas!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.736
(demonic growling)

24:34.406 --> 24:36.175
Do it.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.710
(demon growls)

24:52.491 --> 24:54.994
(panting)

25:04.403 --> 25:06.505
Oh.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.848
Oh.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.128
(sirens wailing)

25:32.398 --> 25:34.100
Inside. Inside!

25:34.133 --> 25:36.335
(indistinct chatter)

25:36.368 --> 25:38.671
(pounding)

25:38.705 --> 25:40.339
(officers shouting outside)

25:40.372 --> 25:41.507
Over here.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.842
There's nothing out here.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.211
ROSE:
I want to make one thing clear.

25:45.244 --> 25:48.748
Andrew Kim
was an amazing father.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.850
I've known him since college.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.086
And whatever happened,
whatever he did,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.689
it doesn't change
the fact that for six years,

25:56.723 --> 26:00.026
he loved those kids
with all his heart.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.195
OFFICER: That isn't really
the issue, Miss Cooper.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.231
Four people are dead.

26:05.264 --> 26:08.234
I've got a room full of
foster kids, all beat to hell,

26:08.267 --> 26:10.202
claiming they were attacked
by their own father.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.106
And you said that it
started with this, uh...

26:14.140 --> 26:16.475
Lorraine Graeme.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.744
That's right.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.813
She broke into the house

26:20.847 --> 26:22.548
and she held a knife

26:22.581 --> 26:24.917
to her own daughter's throat.

26:24.951 --> 26:28.554
What Andy did was self-defense.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.823
OFFICER:
He disemboweled her.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.893
ROSE:
He was protecting his family.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.995
OFFICER:
And the neighbors?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.764
Russ and Colleen Holstrom.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.066
Was that also self-defense?

26:40.099 --> 26:44.070
ROSE: Something happened to Andy
after he killed Lorraine.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.805
OFFICER: And then when you tried
to take them off the island,

26:45.838 --> 26:46.839
that's when he got

26:46.873 --> 26:48.641
violent against the children.

26:48.675 --> 26:49.742
ROSE:
Yes.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.010
Against you.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.679
Yes.

26:52.712 --> 26:57.016
But you didn't report
the assault...

26:57.049 --> 26:59.418
or the murder of Miss Graeme.

26:59.451 --> 27:04.456
I was trapped on an island
with no power, no cell service,

27:04.490 --> 27:07.126
chased by
a disturbed individual,

27:07.159 --> 27:10.697
with four traumatized kids
in need of medical attention.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.733
I thought the paperwork
could wait.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.371
I have to say what you did...

27:19.405 --> 27:22.675
took a lot of guts.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.211
Those kids are alive
because of you.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.882
When can I see them?

27:31.718 --> 27:34.954
HARPER:
What's gonna happen to us?

27:34.987 --> 27:39.525
They're gonna put us in homes.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.293
Together?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.529
It doesn't matter where
they send us.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.365
We're still a family.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.838
ROSE:
Okay, guys, they said we can go.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.573
Thank you for watching them.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.042
TOMAS:
Of course.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.176
Come on.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.380
Rose. Um...

28:04.616 --> 28:05.918
Before he died,

28:05.952 --> 28:08.387
he gave me a message
for the kids...

28:10.723 --> 28:13.025
...and for you.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.864
What kind of message?

28:20.132 --> 28:22.802
He said that every kiss
was real.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.875
From the party in college to the
first night Harper came to stay.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.846
He should have told you
how he felt,

28:33.880 --> 28:36.015
what you meant to him,

28:36.048 --> 28:40.252
but he hopes you knew it anyway.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.830
What did he say?

29:00.006 --> 29:02.541
He said tell the kids that...

29:02.574 --> 29:04.710
Nikki and I loved them.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.413
(chuckles softly)

29:07.446 --> 29:10.216
We loved them all so damn much.

29:10.249 --> 29:15.721
Tell Truck, never forget
that he is smarter

29:15.754 --> 29:17.423
and kinder

29:17.456 --> 29:20.092
than anyone gives him
credit for.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.461
And just because sometimes
people don't see that

29:22.494 --> 29:24.396
doesn't mean it's not true.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.465
Tell Harper,

29:26.498 --> 29:28.400
don't let anyone tell you

29:28.434 --> 29:33.072
that anything's wrong with you
because you are perfect

29:33.105 --> 29:34.907
in every way.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.177
And, um, even though you
weren't in my house for long,

29:38.210 --> 29:41.480
you will always be my daughter.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.786
Caleb...

29:49.989 --> 29:53.425
...I am in awe of your courage

29:53.459 --> 29:55.527
and the fact that you can
still face the world

29:55.561 --> 29:58.597
with a smile on your face
makes me love you...

29:58.630 --> 30:01.600
(laughs) all the more.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.171
Shelby...

30:05.204 --> 30:08.007
I know...

30:08.040 --> 30:12.011
you did everything you could
to protect our family.

30:12.044 --> 30:16.282
You were strong when I was weak

30:16.315 --> 30:20.052
and you were brave
when it mattered.

30:20.086 --> 30:25.324
Ah, God, I'm so proud
to call you my son.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.998
And tell Verity...

30:33.665 --> 30:38.504
...tell Verity that she changed
our lives when she came to stay.

30:38.537 --> 30:42.241
She saved us.

30:47.579 --> 30:51.383
Tell them that it doesn't matter
where you came from.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.853
Every one of you is gonna go
to do amazing things

30:54.887 --> 30:57.356
and live amazing lives.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.995
And even though he may not
be there to see it happen,

31:03.029 --> 31:05.998
you will always...

31:06.032 --> 31:11.537
...always be a part of me.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.744
Andy died

31:18.777 --> 31:22.881
to stop the demon from hurting
anyone ever again.

31:22.915 --> 31:27.853
I hope you know your father
was a hero.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.957
Yeah. We know.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.591
(sniffles)

31:41.567 --> 31:44.370
ROSE:
Thank you.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.305
Come on, guys.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.943
(sniffles)

32:18.370 --> 32:19.938
How is he?

32:19.972 --> 32:22.274
You should talk to him.

32:41.060 --> 32:45.164
(cupboard opens, closes)

32:47.533 --> 32:51.037
We can leave whenever
you're ready.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.273
I'm not going.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.775
What?

32:56.808 --> 33:01.313
You can't do this job
if you're compromised.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.649
I learned that a long time ago.

33:03.682 --> 33:07.153
I took a man's life.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.720
I'm unworthy.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.957
No.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.960
Andy knew there
was no coming back.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.729
He wanted you to stop
the demon no matter the cost.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.068
It's still murder.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.670
Still a mortal sin.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.306
Every sin can be forgiven.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.643
There are rules
in place for a reason.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.545
We maintain purity,

33:33.579 --> 33:36.315
we don't harm the innocent,
we put duty before self.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.151
How many lives...

33:39.185 --> 33:41.019
will be saved
because of Andy's sacrifice?

33:41.053 --> 33:43.322
Because of what you did?

33:43.355 --> 33:47.326
I don't regret
pulling the trigger.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.829
But I can't pretend
it never happened.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.766
It's been a long time since...

33:54.800 --> 33:57.836
since I heard God's voice,

33:57.869 --> 34:02.007
or... felt His touch.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.545
And now, I don't feel
anything at all.

34:08.447 --> 34:14.052
How can I be a vessel for His
grace when, in that moment...

34:16.222 --> 34:20.659
I rejected His love?

34:22.128 --> 34:26.265
I was so close to saving him.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.470
I could have done it.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.572
But you'd have been lost.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.608
It was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.077
I wasn't.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.080
Marcus, Marcus.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.049
I, I...

34:44.082 --> 34:47.719
I don't know how
to do this without you.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.389
You'll learn.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.924
You're an exorcist.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.728
You put your trust in God.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.531
No one else.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.438
Until the next time.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.818
Adios, hermano.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.493
Not forever.

35:28.794 --> 35:32.431
Just for now.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.733
For now.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.879
You've come a long way...

35:47.913 --> 35:52.017
little church mouse.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.885
Keep an eye on him.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.887
Don't let him drive.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.789
He's rubbish at it.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.124
(laughs softly)

35:59.157 --> 36:01.126
I will.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.763
Take care of yourself.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.401
You, too.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.173
Tomas.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.777
(sighs)

36:51.810 --> 36:53.745
It's-it's fine. Uh...

36:53.779 --> 36:57.949
He does this sort
of thing, yeah.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.486
He'll come back.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.490
I don't think so.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.373
I cannot do this alone.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.475
You don't have to.

37:25.243 --> 37:30.282
If God brought you to Marcus
to help start your journey,

37:30.316 --> 37:34.252
maybe he sent me to you
to help you finish it.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.256
I believe in you, Tomas.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.428
And I believe
there's more work to be done.

37:42.461 --> 37:46.332
Will you help me?

37:53.605 --> 37:56.141
You know, we're being hunted by
the single largest, richest,

37:56.174 --> 37:59.745
and most powerful organization
in the history of mankind.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.980
I'm not afraid.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.016
I had a good teacher.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.357
(engine starts)

38:19.164 --> 38:21.132

38:21.166 --> 38:23.301

38:37.048 --> 38:39.518

38:46.725 --> 38:48.660

39:16.254 --> 39:18.890

39:18.924 --> 39:22.694
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

39:25.363 --> 39:27.766
(lock buzzes)

39:31.236 --> 39:33.004
Am I allowed to hug her?

39:33.038 --> 39:34.172
ROSE:
Yes.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.374
You're allowed.

39:47.285 --> 39:48.887
TRUCK:
I miss him.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.123
Me, too.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.560
How are you holding up?

39:54.593 --> 39:58.564
I can't sleep.

39:58.597 --> 40:02.568
They don't turn the lights off,
and no one talks to me.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.972
What if I told you,

40:07.005 --> 40:09.541
I might have found
a home for you?

40:09.575 --> 40:12.944
It's temporary.

40:12.978 --> 40:16.381
But maybe one day,
it will be permanent.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.916
Really?

40:21.920 --> 40:24.956
ROSE: You have to
promise me something.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.225
This is a brand-new
foster parent.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.894
Never done it before.

40:28.927 --> 40:33.999
So you're gonna have to be
really patient with her, okay?

40:34.032 --> 40:35.867
Okay.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.979
So what do you think?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.017
It's nice.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.673
This is your house?

41:16.241 --> 41:18.276
Would that be okay?

41:18.309 --> 41:22.013
(indistinct chatter nearby)

41:22.047 --> 41:23.649
SHELBY:
You know what I'm saying?

41:23.682 --> 41:26.151
-Just don't hurt yourself, okay?
-VERITY: I'm not.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.219
SHELBY: Are you sure
you don't need any help?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.555
'Cause you're gonna fall.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.722
VERITY:
Dude, I got this.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.924
Don't call me dude, bro.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.827
Truck.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.797
-CALEB: Truck!
-Guys, I missed you.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.832
Oh, oh, oh, no, ah, no.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.968
-(all shouting, laughing)
-Truck's just too big.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.705
-TRUCK: Okay, whoa.
-(shouting, laughing continues)

41:46.738 --> 41:48.574
TRUCK:
Oh, God! I'm-I'm down.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.009
-I missed you guys.
-CALEB: Missed you, too.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.644
-TRUCK: Ah.
-HARPER: You got bigger.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.846
TRUCK:
I love you.

41:58.717 --> 42:01.687
MAN:
Slip 14, you'll see it.

42:03.755 --> 42:07.693
(indistinct chatter)

42:07.726 --> 42:10.128
MAN: You know, that's what
I don't understand.

42:13.064 --> 42:17.836
How you feeling, man?
I'm ready to go home.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.772
Hey, fellas.
How's it going?

42:20.806 --> 42:22.908
No catch for me...

42:22.941 --> 42:26.912
(indistinct chatter continues)

42:50.736 --> 42:54.873
(low rumbling)

42:54.906 --> 42:57.643

43:06.685 --> 43:08.820
(whispering):
Yes.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.260
I can hear you.

43:17.362 --> 43:19.297
I'm listening.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.946
Tomas.

here are a few more shows
