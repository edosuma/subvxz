08:53.750 --> 08:56.640
Right. There were several 911 calls
in the area during the hoax.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.230
Two domestic disputes, a burglary,
and a fight at a local dive bar.

09:00.430 --> 09:04.150
One of the men assaulted at the bar fight
was treated at DC General.

09:04.350 --> 09:05.980
Which we thought may be related,

it seemed like it was a personal matter.

next to DC General placed a 911 call.

Saw someone suspicious using a tool
to get into a silver Audi on the lot.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.120
The janitor gave the plate to the police,
but when they responded, the car was gone.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.590
The police assumed the owner would report
if anything had been taken.

you need to pay our friend Phil a visit.

Yeah, he refused to receive it,
hasn't paid us, and won't return my calls.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.820
He needs to start construction
by the end of next week.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.570
He can't do that without materials.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.080
Does he realize how hard it is
to get steel right now?

10:41.280 --> 10:44.430
And I called in a favor to fast-track it.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.750

- Before you do, there's one more thing.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.430
Bring him to DC.

11:00.630 --> 11:04.080
I'll head down
after I pay a visit to Phil.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.320
Mr. Thieman.
So glad we could make this work.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.320
You do realize this is the first time
HexRoot's left the Pentagon.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.200
Yes, and we appreciate your concerns.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.370
But what is politics
without some pageantry?

11:19.570 --> 11:23.140
The committee is gathering right now
and looking forward to the presentation.

11:26.350 --> 11:27.810
- [machine beeps]
- [lock clicks]

11:30.980 --> 11:32.020
They're going up.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.510
Wujing made it very clear,
we have one shot.

11:35.710 --> 11:37.970
No second chances. Call the troll farm.

11:38.170 --> 11:39.240
Tell them it's time.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.890
- [telephone rings]
- [Dembe] <i>Malik, did you reach Flynn?</i>

11:44.090 --> 11:46.100
I called to let him know
you're on your way to his office,

11:46.300 --> 11:47.480
<i>but I got his assistant.</i>

11:47.680 --> 11:50.610
She said Flynn's in a closed-door
intelligence committee meeting

11:50.810 --> 11:51.730
happening right now.

11:51.930 --> 11:54.360
So Chang broke into the vehicle
of a man attending

11:54.560 --> 11:56.530
a top-secret intelligence meeting today?

11:56.730 --> 11:57.610
That can't be good.

11:57.810 --> 12:00.160
It's taking place
at one of their satellite offices,

12:00.360 --> 12:02.630
the Stevenson Building,
for security purposes.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.250
I'd like to start by expressing
our gratitude to the NSA, Mr. Thieman.

12:07.450 --> 12:12.170
As you know, we have requested
this demonstration for some time.

12:12.370 --> 12:14.050
Yes, and you've been very persistent.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.470
We've spent billions
developing the program.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.340
It would be irresponsible
not to have some oversight

12:19.540 --> 12:21.300
on the progress the agency's made.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.240
- You can understand that.
- Of course.

12:24.030 --> 12:26.200
So, without further ado,

12:26.950 --> 12:29.740
this is HexRoot.

12:30.620 --> 12:34.480
A world-class malware program
that targets supervisory control

12:34.680 --> 12:35.980
and data-acquisition systems.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.030
Now, it hones in on PLCs

12:38.230 --> 12:41.490
that allow for automation
of electro-mechanical processes.

12:41.690 --> 12:44.950
We've developed stealth programs
in a similar vein,

12:45.150 --> 12:46.750
but what makes HexRoot unique

12:46.950 --> 12:49.420
is it's deployable
from this mobile command-center unit

12:49.610 --> 12:51.130
and can be taken into the field.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.670
I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm getting word
that we have a situation in the building.

12:54.870 --> 12:55.880
What kind of situation?

12:56.080 --> 12:58.260
[alarm blaring]

12:58.460 --> 12:59.840
I've got an update, guys.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.050
Reports of a massive fire
at the Stevenson Building.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.850
<i>Or an explosion that started a fire.</i>
<i>It's unclear.</i>

13:06.050 --> 13:07.220
I keep having to refresh.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.770
But social-media posts
are coming in one after another.

13:09.970 --> 13:11.440
<i>I've reached out to fire and EMS,</i>

13:11.640 --> 13:14.150
they're treating it as a credible threat
until they're on the ground.

13:14.350 --> 13:15.900
- This has to be Chang.
- Has to be.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.990
Well, I'm watching live footage
of smoke coming out the windows.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.740
If it's another false-flag attack,
it's a convincing one.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.410
All right, we're two minutes out.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.240
Suspicious package? What?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.240
How? Nobody even knows about this site.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.410
I don't have details yet,

13:28.610 --> 13:30.960
but we're been told
to follow protocol and evacuate.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.210
Committee members to the east stairwell.
NSA to the west stairwell.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.000
We're to stay outside the building
until Capitol Police arrive.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.980
- This presentation is hereby suspended.
- For now. We'll find another time.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.530
[alarms blaring]

13:45.530 --> 13:47.720
- Restricted area!
- Officer, we need to get through here.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.980
- I'm sorry. I can't allow that.
- We're with the NSA.

13:50.170 --> 13:51.850
We're operating
under a presidential directive.

13:52.050 --> 13:54.520
Now step aside or my men will move you.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.810
Will they? Really?

13:56.010 --> 13:57.360
Hands away from your weapons!
Where we can see them!

13:57.560 --> 13:58.900
Hands high! Keep 'em high or we shoot!

13:59.100 --> 14:00.860
Lock your hands behind your head!

14:01.060 --> 14:04.800
- I can't put my hands behind my head!
- You'll be able to in a moment.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.930
[ominous music playing]

14:22.360 --> 14:24.090
Excuse me. Agent Ressler, FBI.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.010
This is Agent Zuma.
We need to speak with you and your boss.

14:27.210 --> 14:30.990
He's on with the Secretary of Defense.
We're dealing with a crisis at the moment.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.580
[softly] I'll do it.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.230
[softly] The FBI, sir.

14:36.430 --> 14:39.460
Mr. Congressman,
Agent Zuma, Agent Ressler, FBI.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.650
We have reason to believe
the purpose of this charade,

14:42.850 --> 14:45.450
the fire and explosion,
was to target your meeting.

14:45.650 --> 14:49.540
Our meeting today was classified.
Look, guys, I'm under the gun here--

14:49.730 --> 14:53.460
It's quite obvious that something critical
went down here today.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.420
The man behind these events today
is highly dangerous.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.630
We know he was after something here.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.100
We just don't know what.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.680
He was after HexRoot.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.720
- HexRoot?
- It's a new cyber weapon.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.680
Our meeting was with the NSA.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.270
They were about to demonstrate
HexRoot's capabilities

15:12.470 --> 15:13.600
when all hell broke loose.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.310
In the chaos, the NSA team was ambushed,
the weapon stolen.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.690
The fact that it's gone is catastrophic.

15:19.890 --> 15:21.900
Can you tell us more about HexRoot?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.240
[Graham] HexRoot
is next-gen military tech.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.780
It'll saw through any cyber defense
and hide inside any computer network.

15:27.980 --> 15:29.410
And now it's out in the world?

15:29.610 --> 15:30.630
I mean, that's just...

15:31.680 --> 15:34.120
- You know what? Never mind.
- [McFarley] It's okay, Agent Ressler.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.750
I understand your point of view.

15:35.950 --> 15:39.040
But the next World War,
it's gonna be a cyber war.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.300
And this nation needs to do what it takes

15:41.490 --> 15:44.650
to defend itself
against the global conflict to come.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.900
That was the whole idea behind HexRoot.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.760
- The NSA team, where are they now?
- With building security.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.160
Trying to get a lead on who attacked them.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.400
[classical music playing]

15:59.600 --> 16:01.160
[footsteps approaching]

16:03.830 --> 16:05.210
[Reddington] Hello, Phillip.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.030
Reddington.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.420
- How'd you find me?
- [chuckles]

16:12.050 --> 16:14.160
Phil, you're as predictable
as the demographic

16:14.360 --> 16:17.390
in one of the city's
most pretentious men's clubs.

16:18.430 --> 16:22.940
A predictability I'd grown to appreciate
in our years of doing business.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.970
So imagine my surprise
when you failed to pay me

16:27.170 --> 16:30.970
and rejected my shipment
for the first time in... 17 years?

16:31.170 --> 16:35.780
I know. But I'm between
a rock and a hard place.

16:36.450 --> 16:39.690
Really? It's actually
quite comfortable here.

16:39.890 --> 16:42.230
Little bit stuffy. Bit stale.

16:42.430 --> 16:45.820
People keep telling me
that you've cozied up to the feds.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.650
I'm concerned.
I don't want to believe them.

16:48.850 --> 16:50.210
Well, perhaps you should.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.800
Because I have.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.700
I also work with assets from the Mossad,

16:57.900 --> 17:01.750
MI6, CIA, FSB.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.880
I have judges in my pocket.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.270
People in police departments
from New York to New Delhi.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.110
The way they were talking
about the FBI, though,

17:12.610 --> 17:13.970
it was different.

17:14.170 --> 17:15.600
People were insinuating

17:15.800 --> 17:18.560
that you were handing people over
to a secret task force.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.650
That... That some of my own associates

17:21.840 --> 17:24.250
have gone to federal prison
directly because of you.

17:26.830 --> 17:28.440
When I was a child,

17:28.640 --> 17:32.030
I spent many summers
at my grandmother's farm.

17:32.230 --> 17:36.830
She kept pigs, chickens,
and some cows, sheep.

17:37.030 --> 17:40.600
And there was this one little goat, Belka.

17:42.430 --> 17:44.890
Poor thing had only one eye.

17:45.850 --> 17:49.810
My grandmother thought she was hideous,
but I took quite a shine to her.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.760
Those summers were...

17:53.960 --> 17:55.800
[breathes deeply]

17:56.000 --> 17:57.450
paradise.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.330
And my grandmother gave me free rein.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.200
She had only one rule:

18:05.210 --> 18:07.080
stay out of the green shed.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.300
Year after year,
I thought and thought of that shed.

18:15.090 --> 18:18.680
I dreamed and nightmared of the place.

18:20.010 --> 18:21.850
What could possibly be in there?

18:23.140 --> 18:25.140
What sort of secrets did it hold?

18:25.850 --> 18:27.350
And who went in there?

18:28.350 --> 18:29.480
And when?

18:29.980 --> 18:30.980
Why?

18:32.270 --> 18:34.980
Well, one day,

18:36.070 --> 18:39.240
Belka went missing.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.410
Must have gotten out of her pen.

18:45.410 --> 18:47.060
And I looked.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.580
I looked all over the property.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.320
It was getting late.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.920
Getting dark.

18:55.630 --> 18:59.050
And then I heard it,
her familiar little bleat.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.640
And it was coming from the shed.

19:05.390 --> 19:07.500
I don't know how she got there,

19:07.700 --> 19:11.600
but I screwed up my courage
and pulled open the door.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.280
Do you know what was in that shed?

19:18.530 --> 19:19.820
No.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.120
Nothing.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.830
Literally nothing but a little hay.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.910
And Belka, of course.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.650
All that fear

19:32.850 --> 19:35.200
and trepidation,

19:35.390 --> 19:36.840
anticipation

19:38.670 --> 19:39.720
for nothing.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.080
Tell yourself all the stories
you want to about me, Phil,

19:46.280 --> 19:48.680
but there's nothing there
except a one-eyed goat.

19:51.230 --> 19:52.650
Still getting rich?

19:53.810 --> 19:54.860
Of course.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
And I appreciate it.

19:58.070 --> 20:01.390
Do you understand
the competitive advantage I offer?

20:01.590 --> 20:05.850
Steel, wood, cement at close to cost.

20:06.050 --> 20:09.060
Expedited shipments
when supply-chain issues

20:09.260 --> 20:12.330
are delaying projects for months,
if not years.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.690
How long has it been
since you've had a labor problem?

20:15.890 --> 20:17.780
I know all you've done for me.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.670
Then stop worrying about the feds.

20:22.260 --> 20:26.290
I have a soft spot in my heart
for the sort of development you do.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.080
But make no mistake,

20:28.280 --> 20:31.890
you can't do it the way you do it

20:33.270 --> 20:34.310
without me.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.400
I expect full payment by tomorrow morning.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.760
And if something like this
ever happens again,

20:42.960 --> 20:45.450
it won't end with a polite conversation.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.370
I have a train to catch.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.780
We're still on the ground here,
but we're making progress.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.490
I'm coordinating with the Capitol Police
and the building security.

21:03.690 --> 21:06.490
<i>We confirmed why Chang</i>
<i>targeted Graham Flynn.</i>

21:06.690 --> 21:10.000
Chang used Flynn's work credentials
to access a secure entrance.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.920
That's where he ambushed
the NSA officer and his guards.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.420
How'd he get the credentials?

21:14.620 --> 21:17.880
We assume that he cloned them somehow.
It's all within his skill set.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.130
That's why he broke into Flynn's car.
Remember, nothing was "stolen."

21:21.330 --> 21:23.390
So we know how Wujing
orchestrated the attack

21:23.590 --> 21:24.970
and what he wanted, but why?

21:25.170 --> 21:26.060
Why not?

21:26.260 --> 21:28.640
That thing they stole
is a digital nuclear bomb.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.150
It can destroy anything,
people, corporations, governments.

21:32.340 --> 21:33.560
That's worth a lot of money.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.360
I find it hard to believe
Wujing's motivation was purely financial.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.460
What would he use that device for?

21:39.340 --> 21:42.070
- It's Malik and Cooper.
- Sorry to interrupt, but this can't wait.

21:42.270 --> 21:46.200
The NSA officer just informed me
that there's a concealed geo-locator

21:46.400 --> 21:49.290
embedded inside the metal case
that contains the HexRoot.

21:49.490 --> 21:50.540
Well, that's convenient.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.710
[Ressler] <i>Leave it to the NSA</i>
<i>to hide tech within their tech.</i>

21:52.910 --> 21:55.460
Now I don't suppose
they're gonna share that location with us?

21:55.660 --> 21:58.090
No. But I saw the coordinates
on the computer screen.

21:58.290 --> 21:59.380
I texted them to you.

21:59.580 --> 22:01.840
<i>They're assembling a team to move in</i>
<i>by the end of the hour.</i>

22:02.040 --> 22:03.970
We need to move fast
if we want to beat them there.

22:04.170 --> 22:05.050
Can we?

22:05.250 --> 22:07.510
You mean outfox the NSA foxes?

22:07.710 --> 22:09.060
I believe we can.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.580
Let's get a tac team
to that location immediately.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.400
- [door closes]
- [lock clicks]

22:18.600 --> 22:20.530
[sighs] What's going on?

22:20.730 --> 22:22.570
Let's see what we got here.

22:22.770 --> 22:24.860
Extra-spicy burrito, no rice.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.180
- You get jalapenos on mine?
- Uh-huh.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.620
- FBI!
- FBI! Hands where we can see them!

22:29.820 --> 22:31.750
[agents shouting indistinctly]

22:31.950 --> 22:32.890
[grunts]

22:34.680 --> 22:36.580
Mr. Chang, we meet again.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.730
[dramatic music playing]

22:51.450 --> 22:53.530
[elevator door opens]

22:55.330 --> 22:56.440
What is this place?

22:56.640 --> 22:57.790
Oh, just the office.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.860
Harold Cooper, FBI.

23:01.060 --> 23:01.990
Rod Thieman, NSA.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.360
What, uh, exactly
does your task force do here?

23:04.560 --> 23:05.950
I'm afraid that's classified.

23:06.150 --> 23:09.620
We operate under special authority
from the Attorney General.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.160
I'm sure you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.170
Well, whatever it is, you, uh...
you obviously must be very good at it.

23:16.370 --> 23:19.250
You beat us
to our own classified super weapon.

23:19.450 --> 23:21.670
We have a team examining
Chang's hard drives

23:21.870 --> 23:24.090
to see if the program
was uploaded or compromised.

23:24.290 --> 23:26.220
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Could be them now.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.360
Nope.

23:28.610 --> 23:29.990
[whispers] Herbie.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.080
So, uh, who exactly
is this Chang character anyway?

23:34.990 --> 23:35.940
MIT grad.

23:36.140 --> 23:39.480
Started his career as a security engineer
for GetToGather.net.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.610
Now he creates social-media events
to commit crimes.

23:42.810 --> 23:46.030
But he's never done anything close
to stealing an NSA weapon before.

23:46.230 --> 23:48.870
He a solo act, or you think
he's working for someone else?

23:49.060 --> 23:50.620
Your guess is as good as mine.

23:50.820 --> 23:54.200
We know you're working with Wujing.
We know you stole HexRoot for him.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.140
But what we don't know is why.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.540
Agent Ressler.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.140
I thought you looked familiar.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.900
You ruined my life.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.110
I'm pretty sure
you did that all on your own.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.680
And you...

24:08.880 --> 24:11.890
I guess we both got tired
of working for Reddington, huh?

24:12.090 --> 24:13.470
The feds, though?

24:13.670 --> 24:14.870
Really, Dembe?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.740
You can address me as Agent Zuma.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.020
You wanna know why
I got on board with Wujing?

24:21.220 --> 24:22.170
Reddington.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.960
I was on retainer with that man
for three years.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.820
Did some of my best work with him, too.

24:29.020 --> 24:33.580
I got him and Elizabeth Keen out of DC
in the middle of a national manhunt.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.790
And how'd he repay me?

24:34.990 --> 24:37.850
By giving up me and my entire team to you.

24:39.850 --> 24:41.540
He's a snake.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.710
What makes you think
Reddington gave you up?

24:43.910 --> 24:46.340
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

24:46.540 --> 24:48.170
I am not playing that game.

24:48.370 --> 24:50.470
We both know who you people
really work for.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.820
Why does Wujing want HexRoot?

24:54.360 --> 24:55.850
I got nothing else to say.

24:56.050 --> 24:58.030
You tell that to Reddington and his hat.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.000
That damn hat.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.960
When I saw it, I couldn't resist.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.710
- There you go.
- [Herbie chuckles]

25:09.630 --> 25:11.530
She looks just like you.

25:11.730 --> 25:12.700
[both laugh]

25:12.900 --> 25:15.790
I wasn't expecting you today.
You need a place to crash tonight?

25:15.990 --> 25:18.960
No, no, no.
This isn't purely a social call.

25:19.150 --> 25:23.210
- Harold Cooper reached out to me.
- Harold? I love that guy.

25:23.410 --> 25:24.540
He's so regal.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.590
And firm. And there's a little softness
to him, you know?

25:27.790 --> 25:29.720
That's all very... specific.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.070
He told me you've been calling Ms. Malik.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.180
Obsessively.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.910
Did he actually use that word?

25:38.280 --> 25:39.560
I blew it, didn't I?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.790
What is your aim here?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.440
I gotta get outta the house.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.610
All my work is done at an arm's length.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.030
No one wants me on a crime scene
or in a courtroom

25:49.230 --> 25:51.570
after everything that happened.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.510
And working with them,

25:54.340 --> 25:57.700
for a moment, I felt like I was back
in the game again. On a team.

25:57.900 --> 26:00.410
And, oh, that whole secret hideout
where they work?

26:00.610 --> 26:02.750
With the blacked-out van
and the cool goggles?

26:02.950 --> 26:04.250
It was all so exciting.

26:04.450 --> 26:07.710
You really want this, don't you, Herbie?
A full-time job?

26:07.910 --> 26:09.260
I do.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.550
I mean, not, like, full full-time.
I have Sue. And my foosball and stuff.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.200
But, yes, mostly full-time.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.140
When I can, of course.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.890
If you get the chance to speak to Harold,

26:20.090 --> 26:22.940
I wouldn't lead
with all the other obligations.

26:23.140 --> 26:25.060
Well, since I don't have his phone number,

26:25.260 --> 26:27.770
and I get the strong feeling
he might not want me to have it,

26:27.970 --> 26:31.070
the next time <i>you </i>speak to Harold,
could you put in a good word?

26:31.270 --> 26:33.400
- [Sue coos]
- [sniffs] Is that...

26:33.600 --> 26:35.490
Poop, yes. Right on schedule.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.970
It really does define your day,
doesn't it?

26:38.590 --> 26:39.660
Perfectly.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.290
All right. Come here.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.600
[Sue coos]

26:46.980 --> 26:48.210
He won't talk.

26:48.410 --> 26:50.050
He's too afraid.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.170
What, of Wujing?

26:51.370 --> 26:52.470
Afraid of Raymond.

26:52.660 --> 26:54.760
Well, it doesn't matter.
We need to keep working on him.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.800
We need to figure out
why Wujing stole HexRoot.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.070
I mean,
it's obviously part of a larger plan.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.830
Maybe we don't need Chang
to talk to us to figure it out.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.520
Why? What are you thinking?

27:06.720 --> 27:11.190
Wujing broke The Freelancer out of custody
to come after the task force last week.

27:11.390 --> 27:12.280
Why?

27:12.480 --> 27:14.030
To gather photographic evidence,

27:14.230 --> 27:16.070
proof of Reddington's connection
to our team.

27:16.270 --> 27:19.200
And now there's another Blacklister
with a grudge against us

27:19.400 --> 27:20.830
sent out by Wujing.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.200
Stands to reason he's after the same goal.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.640
To find more proof.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.330
Look at the object that he stole.

27:27.530 --> 27:30.850
A virus that covertly invades
and controls a computer system.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.900
Our computer system.

27:33.650 --> 27:36.220
With all our case files
and questionable tactics.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.110
Not to mention the immunity agreement
that Raymond has with Main Justice.

27:41.030 --> 27:44.700
Can you imagine if all of that came out?
I can see the national headlines now.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.310
With our faces right below them.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.110
Okay, I buy it.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.020
I just have one more question.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.110
[door opens]

27:52.310 --> 27:53.190
Where's the drop?

27:53.390 --> 27:54.360
We know you stole HexRoot,

27:54.560 --> 27:56.710
so what's the plan
to get the device to Wujing?

27:57.760 --> 27:58.910
What's in it for me?

27:59.110 --> 28:03.370
How about survival?
That's if we're in bed with Reddington,

28:03.570 --> 28:04.870
- as you suggest.
- Which we're not.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.250
Then everything said in this room
would get back to him.

28:07.450 --> 28:10.840
Including the fact that you helped
his task force capture Wujing.

28:11.030 --> 28:13.210
That assistance may just be enough

28:13.410 --> 28:16.470
to keep you alive in prison
and safe from Reddington's retribution.

28:16.670 --> 28:19.140
I mean, that's if the task force
works with Reddington.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.280
Which it doesn't.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.600
The drop's today at 4:00.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.370
Madison Park in Northeast.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.070
You just make sure Reddington
finds out that I'm helping you.

28:32.260 --> 28:33.480
[door closes]

28:33.680 --> 28:35.440
[Siya] These are
satellite shots of the park.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.200
Plenty of places to hide a team.

28:37.390 --> 28:40.450
Do you think Wujing will make
an appearance to retrieve the device?

28:40.650 --> 28:43.740
Chang seemed to think so.
He's agreed to assist in our operation.

28:43.940 --> 28:45.200
Should we involve Raymond?

28:45.400 --> 28:47.330
We know Reddington's endgame here.

28:47.530 --> 28:50.290
It's not our job to aid and abet him
in murdering Wujing.

28:50.490 --> 28:53.130
Our job is to arrest a criminal,
stop a war,

28:53.330 --> 28:54.800
and to protect this task force.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.800
I want a surveillance plan
for Madison Park in the next hour.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.890
If Wujing shows up, this ends today.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.030
[tense music playing]

29:09.790 --> 29:12.770
[device beeps]

29:12.970 --> 29:14.980
You all good?
You understand how that wire works?

29:15.180 --> 29:17.240
I do. But I wouldn't say I'm "all good."

29:17.430 --> 29:19.280
I can't believe
I'm working for Reddington again.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.910
You're not. You're working for the FBI.

29:22.110 --> 29:25.280
Again with the charade?
Just own it already, man.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.620
[Ressler] It's a duplicate case.

29:26.820 --> 29:30.710
All the electronics are non-functional,
so don't open it up during the handoff.

29:30.910 --> 29:33.380
[over intercom]
<i>Let's go over this thing one more time.</i>

29:33.580 --> 29:34.670
[button clicks]

29:34.870 --> 29:36.170
You think he can handle this?

29:36.370 --> 29:41.130
He engineered and executed a plan
to steal a top-secret weapon from the NSA.

29:41.330 --> 29:42.640
He'll be okay.

29:42.830 --> 29:44.320
Can I be candid with you?

29:45.950 --> 29:49.430
I was a bit thrown off
by Cooper's decision

29:49.630 --> 29:52.060
not to tell Reddington
about the meeting with Wujing.

29:52.260 --> 29:53.980
Aren't we supposed to be a team?

29:54.180 --> 29:57.190
How can this task force function
if you're hiding things from him?

29:57.390 --> 29:59.070
Raymond hides things, as well.

29:59.270 --> 30:02.760
If you don't trust him,
and he doesn't trust the task force,

30:03.460 --> 30:07.620
how can you possibly make criminal cases
based on his information?

30:07.820 --> 30:09.700
It sounds dysfunctional,

30:09.900 --> 30:11.910
but I have faith

30:12.110 --> 30:14.850
that Raymond wants good things
to happen to good people.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.840
You two were so close before.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.840
Must be strange
keeping things from him now.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.590
We keep things from each other
to <i>protect </i>each other.

30:24.790 --> 30:27.320
It's a healthy mistrust,
and I trust in that, too.

30:28.110 --> 30:29.720
[sighs]

30:29.920 --> 30:33.770
I have to think this place
would have driven my mother mad.

30:33.970 --> 30:36.460
She was so black-and-white.

30:39.380 --> 30:43.820
You think she ever had second thoughts
about working with him?

30:44.020 --> 30:45.820
I'm sure she did.

30:46.020 --> 30:49.330
We all do. It comes with the territory.

30:49.530 --> 30:52.710
But your mother was very guarded.
She kept a lot of things to herself.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.540
You mean, what, like secrets?

30:54.740 --> 30:57.130
Raymond would know better than I do.

30:57.330 --> 30:59.300
He did his own vetting when Diane Fowler

30:59.490 --> 31:02.010
put your mother on the task force
all those years ago.

31:02.210 --> 31:03.570
I don't know the details,

31:04.650 --> 31:07.140
but I always got the impression
that he knew something

31:07.340 --> 31:08.860
about everyone's past.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.020
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

31:12.220 --> 31:13.830
We're all set. Let's go.

31:16.910 --> 31:19.940
- Do we have an update?
- [Chuck] <i>Our man from New Orleans landed.</i>

31:20.140 --> 31:22.400
I don't think you'll have time
to see him beforehand,

31:22.600 --> 31:24.820
but, uh, he's agreed to do the job.

31:25.020 --> 31:27.200
That'll be fine.
As long as everything's on schedule.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.580
We'll reconvene after. I have to go.

31:29.780 --> 31:30.930
[cell phone clicks]

31:32.220 --> 31:33.600
[knocking]

31:37.180 --> 31:39.020
- Hi, Agnes.
- Hey, Pinkie.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.800
You doing some cooking?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.460
Well, I'm doing something.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.380
I'm not sure if you'd call it cooking.

31:45.580 --> 31:46.800
Is Harold around?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.350
He's still at work,
and Mom's out running an errand.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.140
They leave you home alone?

31:51.340 --> 31:52.680
I can handle myself.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.890
I'm sure you can.
Something smells delightful.

31:56.090 --> 31:57.440
What are you baking here?

31:57.640 --> 32:00.360
- That's a complicated question.
- [chuckles]

32:00.560 --> 32:02.670
Here, try this.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.990
It's awful, right?

32:08.190 --> 32:11.430
No. I mean, it leaves
a little something to be desired.

32:12.590 --> 32:13.890
[sniffs] What's in it?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.620
Or perhaps it's something
that's not in it that should be.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.460
Yeah, probably.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.880
I was trying to make
a baking video for my vlog,

32:22.080 --> 32:24.360
and this is my third try.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.470
It'd be pretty shady
to demo bad chocolate cake.

32:27.670 --> 32:32.970
You know, Julia Child didn't graduate
from Le Cordon Bleu until she was 39.

32:33.170 --> 32:36.810
In fact, she even failed
her first exam there.

32:37.010 --> 32:38.540
Practice makes perfect.

32:39.750 --> 32:44.780
And sometimes, a little assistance
doesn't hurt, either. May I?

32:44.980 --> 32:46.170
Of course.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.990
Let's turn that off, just while I'm here.

32:51.190 --> 32:53.450
That sort of defeats
the purpose of a vlog.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.120
It stands for "video blog."

32:55.320 --> 32:59.060
And you can record
to your heart's content once I leave.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.690
Okay. Let's look at this recipe.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.020
Everything's in this bowl.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.140
More information
on the espresso powder below.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.390
[Agnes laughs]

33:14.590 --> 33:15.780
[chuckles]

33:18.030 --> 33:19.540
Hmm.

33:20.120 --> 33:24.360
You're still missing
two crucial ingredients.

33:24.560 --> 33:29.320
- A little <i>more </i>sugar, just that amount.
- Okay.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.880
And also...

33:32.920 --> 33:36.540
- Uh, we don't have any fancy...
- Ah.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.330
European kind of stuff,
if that's what you...

33:39.530 --> 33:40.750
- Mayo?
- [chuckles]

33:40.950 --> 33:42.040
In chocolate cake?

33:42.240 --> 33:43.540
But that's disgusting.

33:43.740 --> 33:48.510
No, it gives it
the perfect level of moisture...

33:48.710 --> 33:50.260
There we go.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.610
And richness.

33:54.070 --> 33:55.110
Ugh.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.490
The key

33:58.490 --> 34:02.140
is to fold the ingredients
together gently.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.440
When we're done,

34:03.640 --> 34:07.190
if this isn't the most decadent cake
you've <i>ever </i>had,

34:07.390 --> 34:13.300
I will personally fly you to Vienna
for a Sachertorte at the Café Demel.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.580
The world's most famous chocolate cake,

34:17.780 --> 34:21.140
and its history is rife with controversy.

34:21.850 --> 34:27.520
It all began in 1832 with a prince.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.050
[Ressler] Well,
there's still no sign of Wujing.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.860
[Dembe] Wasn't he supposed to be here
five minutes ago?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.580
I'm gonna see if I can get a closer look.

34:50.290 --> 34:53.490
Should I stay here?
Something doesn't feel right.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.360
<i>Wujing's never late.</i>

34:55.560 --> 34:56.590
Hold your position.

35:03.010 --> 35:06.540
Knit cap. Black jacket, boots.
My eight o'clock.

35:06.740 --> 35:08.350
Approaching Chang from behind.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.060
I'm here to pick up the package.

35:12.820 --> 35:14.110
It's The Freelancer.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.340
Veseli?

35:16.540 --> 35:18.100
What's he doing here?

35:18.300 --> 35:19.470
[Siya] <i>Should we move in?</i>

35:19.670 --> 35:20.810
What if Wujing is here?

35:21.010 --> 35:23.580
<i>Shouldn't we stand fast</i>
<i>until he reveals himself?</i>

35:28.500 --> 35:31.650
No, we can't wait.
We need to move in now. Now!

35:31.850 --> 35:32.780
What are you doing, man?

35:32.980 --> 35:35.490
What are you doing? What's going on?

35:35.690 --> 35:37.210
[footsteps approaching]

35:41.840 --> 35:43.550
FBI! Stop!

35:44.970 --> 35:46.420
[grunts]

35:46.620 --> 35:47.850
[scooter revs]

35:54.900 --> 35:56.650
[both grunt]

36:08.620 --> 36:09.750
[tires screech]

36:10.710 --> 36:12.080
Get in!

36:13.290 --> 36:15.950
- [engine revs]
- [tires screech]

36:16.140 --> 36:17.150
Was that...

36:17.350 --> 36:19.820
Richard Deever. My former colleague.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.800
[Dembe] He's still working for Wujing?

36:27.890 --> 36:30.420
For the record, that whole thing
at the park, not my fault.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.210
- You'll tell Reddington I tried, right?
- [sighs] Walk.

36:33.410 --> 36:35.340
[Siya] I can't believe it was Deever.

36:35.540 --> 36:38.010
I would've strangled him
with my bare hands if I could.

36:38.210 --> 36:41.030
I can't say I can blame you.
I mean, the guy did shoot you.

36:41.820 --> 36:46.240
I'm so sorry. Seems my old pal Deever's
made a career of absconding with Veseli.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.100
- Do we have any leads?
- The BOLO is out.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.400
Including a description of his sedan.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.080
We got every law-enforcement officer in DC
looking for him.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.740
We need to ditch this car.

37:00.940 --> 37:03.280
They're onto us.
They're <i>more </i>than onto us.

37:03.480 --> 37:07.140
Relax. We don't have far to travel,
and we'll be safer there.

37:10.350 --> 37:11.850
Surprised to see you pull up.

37:13.140 --> 37:15.250
Didn't know you were
still working for Wujing.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.760
I'm the reason why Wujing knows
about the NSA weapon in the first place.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.820
They were developing it
while I was at the CIA.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.760
Once I found out they were planning on
bringing it before the board,

37:24.960 --> 37:27.100
I knew it was his chance to make a move.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.740
Wujing asked me to keep an eye
on the drop as backup.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.000
Well, I'm glad you were there to grab me.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.820
Though I'm a little panicked
as to what's gonna happen

37:37.020 --> 37:39.290
when I show up to Wujing's empty-handed.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.070
It'll be fine.

37:44.270 --> 37:45.550
He's just this way.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.470
Hello, Alban.

37:53.310 --> 37:55.000
Can I go now? I did what you asked.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.350
Not so fast.

37:57.810 --> 38:01.050
That was our deal. You said
if I brought him in, you would let me go.

38:01.250 --> 38:02.760
I never said I'd let you go.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.570
I said I'd let you live.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.000
[cell phone vibrating]

38:22.170 --> 38:23.110
<i>Ms. Malik.</i>

38:23.310 --> 38:27.030
How are you enjoying your time
with the task force so far?

38:27.230 --> 38:29.120
Well, today wasn't so great.

38:29.320 --> 38:32.870
We lost Veseli, then Richard Deever,

38:33.070 --> 38:35.460
and didn't even get eyes on Wujing.

38:35.660 --> 38:38.690
Deever, you and he share a past,
do you not?

38:39.520 --> 38:43.090
I'm pretty sure you're aware
he's the CIA agent who betrayed me.

38:43.290 --> 38:45.760
Ah, well, the nice thing about this job

38:45.960 --> 38:48.850
is that your fortunes
can change on a dime.

38:49.050 --> 38:51.160
I'm texting you an address.

38:51.950 --> 38:53.910
Hold on. It's a new phone.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.440
- Ah. There.
- [cell phone beeps]

38:56.640 --> 38:58.400
I suggest you get there right away.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.570
- Why?
<i>- There's a gift waiting for you.</i>

39:00.770 --> 39:03.460
Consider it a belated
"welcome to the team."

39:06.760 --> 39:08.340
[cell phone chimes]

39:25.820 --> 39:27.890
Well, hey, there, partner.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.320
Did you miss me?

39:32.870 --> 39:35.230
I heard you paid Agnes a visit today.

39:35.430 --> 39:37.730
She was raving
about the merits of mayonnaise.

39:37.930 --> 39:39.270
[chuckles] Yes.

39:39.470 --> 39:40.710
I stopped by.

39:41.460 --> 39:45.700
I was hoping to speak with you
about Herbie Hambright.

39:45.900 --> 39:49.780
Ah, Herbie. He's a little starved
for attention, isn't he?

39:49.980 --> 39:50.870
<i>Indeed.</i>

39:51.070 --> 39:53.000
I think you should hire him, Harold.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.290
Excuse me?

39:54.490 --> 39:57.290
He so desperately
wants to be part of a team.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.210
Your team, in fact.

39:59.410 --> 40:01.380
I think it would be wonderful for him.

40:01.580 --> 40:05.470
Though I should warn you,
he's not entirely a team player.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.680
- What a ringing endorsement.
<i>- He's an unconventional choice.</i>

40:08.880 --> 40:12.850
What can I say? You won't find
a more qualified forensic analyst.

40:13.050 --> 40:15.810
He did do great work for us,
but he'd have to be vetted.

40:16.010 --> 40:19.860
Wasn't he fired by the DA's office
for dropping the ball on a murder case?

40:20.050 --> 40:23.150
No, the DA's office dropped the ball,

40:23.350 --> 40:24.900
and Herbie left the job.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.990
It all took quite a toll on him.

40:27.190 --> 40:30.240
Of course, I'm biased. I adore the guy.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.700
Somewhere in all those frailties
is an incredible mind.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.750
He sees things in ways that others don't.

40:38.950 --> 40:42.590
<i>I really think</i>
<i>he could offer a fresh perspective.</i>

40:42.790 --> 40:44.340
I'll see if I can get him approved.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.090
<i>On a provisional basis.</i>

40:46.290 --> 40:48.340
That sounds just fine.

40:48.540 --> 40:52.550
Harold, I couldn't help but notice
that you forgot to inform me today

40:52.750 --> 40:55.100
about your plan to entrap Wujing.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.270
And you forgot to tell me
that you found Deever.

40:57.470 --> 40:59.390
- I didn't forget.
<i>- What about Veseli?</i>

40:59.590 --> 41:01.940
The man Deever "rescued" for you.
What are you going to do with him?

41:02.140 --> 41:03.900
Whatever the hell I want.

41:04.100 --> 41:07.440
I can't in good conscience
allow you to murder him. Or Wujing.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.000
Or any of these Blacklisters.

41:14.510 --> 41:16.680
So much for being
more transparent with each other.

41:18.390 --> 41:22.460
You know, Harold, I have, in fact,
been keeping something from you.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.290
Something big.

41:24.490 --> 41:27.520
It's time for me
to let you and the task force in.

41:28.230 --> 41:30.090
<i>If we play our cards right,</i>

41:30.290 --> 41:33.720
this war with Wujing
will be over in 72 hours,

41:33.920 --> 41:39.350
and my connection to the task force
will forever remain shrouded in secrecy.

41:39.550 --> 41:42.370
As if it was never there.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.170
[dramatic music playing]
