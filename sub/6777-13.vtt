01:43.570 --> 01:45.595
OKAY, SWEETHEART,
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE.

01:45.630 --> 01:46.767
I DON'T WANT TO.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.892
BUT WE HAVE TO.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.532
GOD HAS OTHER
PLANS FOR HER.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.709
I'LL MISS YOU, BIRDIE.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.401
I KNOW, SWEETH EART.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.704
BUT BY RESCUING HER
AND NURSING HER BACK TO HEALTH

01:55.740 --> 01:57.708
AND NOW
SETTING HER FREE,

01:57.750 --> 01:59.809
WE ARE DOING
A GOOD DEED.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.511
GOOD DEED !

02:01.550 --> 02:04.439
WHEN WE DO SOMETHING KIND,
EVEN FOR A LITTLE LOST BIRD,

02:04.490 --> 02:06.412
WE GIVE A GIFT

02:06.460 --> 02:08.451
THAT RESONATES
THROUGHOUT ALL HUMANITY.

02:08.490 --> 02:10.151
HUMANITY !

02:10.190 --> 02:11.384
SAY BYE BYE.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.499
BYE BYE.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.395
BE FREE,
LITTLE LOST BIRD.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.226
BE FREE.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.769
"NO, FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER !"

02:23.540 --> 02:24.666
NO, FUCK YOU.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.372
YOU'RE A
MOTHERFUCKER !

02:28.510 --> 02:30.899
OH, FUCK ME.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.911
IT'S BROKEN !

02:36.950 --> 02:39.180
BIRD CRAPPED
ON MY HAT.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.482
I JUST NEED
TO WASH IT.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.657
ALRIGHT.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.952
JUST USE THE SINK.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.355
TOILET BROKEN.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.687
AND HURRY UP.

02:45.730 --> 02:46.719
I'M GOING TO CLOSE.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.199
FUCK YOU, MOTHERFUCKER,
FUCK YOU, MOTHERFUCKER.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.730
FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER.

02:54.770 --> 02:57.637
FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER.

02:57.670 --> 03:02.300
FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.940
( toilet flushing )

03:04.980 --> 03:07.278
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS BROKEN !

03:07.320 --> 03:09.311
FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER !

03:11.590 --> 03:13.353
EXCELLENT.

03:13.390 --> 03:14.755
FUCK A-FEE YOU.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.918
( speaking Armenian )

03:17.960 --> 03:19.496
( phone ringing )

03:22.730 --> 03:25.665
HELLO ?

03:25.700 --> 03:27.759
( speaking Armenian )

03:34.640 --> 03:37.905
( static on phone )

04:02.540 --> 04:03.507
ANAHID ?

04:05.670 --> 04:07.672
ANAHID ?

04:07.710 --> 04:10.304
HELLO, HELLO ?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.859
(Uw)
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU WANT TO LEAVE ?

05:06.900 --> 05:07.992
( Nate )
LEAVE ?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.735
OH NO, I WOULD
HAVE TO LEAVE,

05:09.770 --> 05:11.362
BECAUSE I MOVED MY WHOLE FUCKING
LIFE TO THIS SHITHOLE CITY.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.002
NOT FOR ME,
YOU DIDN'T !

05:13.040 --> 05:14.007
SO, YOU WANT
TO SPLIT UP ?

05:14.040 --> 05:14.972
MAYBE, YEAH.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.108
( baby crying )

05:47.840 --> 05:50.547
WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD JUST
LEAVE A CHILD ALONE LIKE THAT ?

05:50.580 --> 05:52.047
OH, DON'T BE
TOO HARD ON HIM.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.547
HE'S NOT HIMSELF
RIGHT NOW.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.946
BESIDES, MAYA IS
FAR FROM ALONE,

05:55.980 --> 05:57.743
AREN'T YOU,
LI'I'I'LE LADY ?

05:57.790 --> 05:59.587
GO TO GRANDMA.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.418
THERE YOU GO.

06:18.470 --> 06:21.405
SO, WHAT IS NATE LIKE
A TOTAL ALKIE NOW ?

06:21.440 --> 06:22.600
I MEAN, SHOULD WE
DO SOMETHING ?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.106
HE'S JUST
NUMBING THE PAIN.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.447
HE HAS TO.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.812
SOMETIMES HE GOES
OUTSIDE TO SMOKE,

06:27.850 --> 06:29.613
AND HE PACES
UNDERNEATH MY WINDOW.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.413
HE TALKS TO HIMSELF.

06:31.450 --> 06:32.610
I KNOW.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.515
SERIOUSLY, LIKE
WHOLE CONVERSATIONS.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.020
WHY IS EVERYONE
IN MY HOUSE ?

06:45.070 --> 06:47.459
MAYA WAS CRYING HER
LITTLE HEART OUT.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.502
WHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU GO
AT 4:30 IN THE MORNING ?

06:49.540 --> 06:50.939
I WAS HAVING
A CIGARETTE.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.631
IN POMONA ?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.705
WE HEARD HER CRYING
ALL THE WAY IN THE HOUSE.

06:54.740 --> 06:55.934
ALL OF US,
POOR THING.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.470
POOR LITTLE BABY.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.046
YOU THOUGHT
NO ONE LOVED YOU.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.481
MOM, I CAN TAKE HER.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.923
WHERE'S HER BLANKY ?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.690
OH, I HAVE IT.

07:12.730 --> 07:14.095
ARE YOU
LIVING HERE NOW ?

07:14.130 --> 07:15.495
NATE !

07:19.770 --> 07:21.032
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.935
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A BIG POT OF COFFEE,

07:22.970 --> 07:25.609
AND THEN YOUR MOTHER AND I
WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.428
IN THE KITCHEN,
IN SAY ABOUT 10 MINUTES ?

07:39.790 --> 07:40.882
YOU'RE GETTING
MARRIED ?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.182
WHEN ?

07:42.220 --> 07:43.687
DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

07:43.730 --> 07:47.951
A SMALL CEREMONY,
JUST ME AND GEORGE,

07:48.000 --> 07:49.228
AND ALL OF YOU.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.228
UH, YOU GUYS MET
LIKE, LAST WEEK.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.261
SIX AND A HALF
WEEKS AGO, ACTUALLY.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.836
MOM !

07:54.870 --> 07:56.269
WHEN EXACTLY WERE YOU
PLANNING ON TELLING US ?

07:56.300 --> 07:58.063
WE ONLY BOOKED THE WEDDING
CHAPEL LAST NIGHT !

07:58.110 --> 08:00.032
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.071
NATE, I LOVE
YOUR MOTHER.

08:02.110 --> 08:03.975
AND SHE LOVES ME.

08:04.010 --> 08:07.173
YEAH, THAT'S JUST SO FUCKING
MOVING I CAN HARDLY STAND IT.

08:07.220 --> 08:11.543
FINE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
WHAT DO I CARE ?

08:14.020 --> 08:15.556
( door slamming )

08:16.990 --> 08:19.151
MOM, MAYBE WITH LISA
AND EVERYTHING, YOU SHOULD--

08:19.190 --> 08:20.851
LIFE DOESN'T STOP,
ALRIGHT ?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.561
WE DIDN'T DIE.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.967
WE HAVE THIS
PRECIOUS GIFT OF LIFE

08:26.000 --> 08:27.797
AND IT'S SO
TERRIBLY FLEETING

08:27.840 --> 08:30.104
AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT TO KEEP ON LIVING,

08:30.140 --> 08:32.574
TO NOT GIVE UP HOPE.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.148
FINE, DON'T COME.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.944
IF NO ONE'S GOING
TO CELEBRATE THIS WITH US,

08:40.980 --> 08:42.311
THEN I DON'T WANT
ANY OF YOU THERE.

08:42.350 --> 08:46.241
LET'S GO
BACK TO BED.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.022
IT'S UPSETTING TO YOU,

08:56.060 --> 08:57.322
THAT YOUR KIDS
DON'T APPROVE, ISN'T IT ?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.860
DO YOUR CHILDREN
APPROVE ?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.664
THEY'RE...

09:01.700 --> 09:03.668
SUPPORTIVE.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.905
BUT MAGGIE SAYS
TO JUST SEND PICTURES.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.828
AND BRIAN SAID SIX
AND HE'S DONE.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.804
I DON'T NEED
THEIR APPROVAL.

09:10.850 --> 09:16.243
NOT ONE OF THEM HAS EVER HAD
A RELATIONSHIP I'D WANT.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.339
GEORGE, I DON'T
WANT TO WAIT.

09:18.390 --> 09:22.759
I FEEL LIKE I'VE SPENT
MY ENTIRE LIFE WAITING.

09:22.790 --> 09:25.122
THEN LET'S NOT WAIT.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.593
THEY DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.599
ALTHOUGH, MAYBE THAT'S
THE BEST TIME TO MARRY SOMEONE.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.063
OTHERWISE,
YOU'D NEVER DO IT.

09:45.850 --> 09:49.013
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP
THROUGH ALL THIS ?

09:49.050 --> 09:52.213
NOT THAT GOOD.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.287
YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ?

09:55.320 --> 09:58.027
HOW CAN I ?

09:58.060 --> 10:02.292
WITH LISA JUST GONE, AND
NATE'S LIKE TOTALLY LOSING IT.

10:02.330 --> 10:06.369
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A RIGHT TO HAVE MY OWN PROBLEMS.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.699
OF COURSE
YOU HAVE A RIGHT.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.374
IS IT RUSSELL ?

10:14.410 --> 10:16.799
GOD, IT'S SO MUCH
MORE THAN THAT.

10:24.150 --> 10:29.679
A YEAR AGO, I WAS LIKE, IF I
CAN JUST GET INTO ART SCHOOL,

10:29.730 --> 10:32.119
THEN MAYBE, FINALLY,

10:32.160 --> 10:34.924
MY LIFE WILL START TO BE
ABOUT SOMETHING, YOU KNOW ?

10:34.960 --> 10:38.794
AND THEN I DO, AND IT'S JUST
SO SICKLY POLITICAL AND DUMB

10:38.830 --> 10:43.108
AND FULL OF EVIL,
HATEFUL FREAKS,

10:43.140 --> 10:48.669
THAT NOW I JUST DESPISE THE ONE
THING THAT WAS MY ONLY HOPE.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.687
AND YOUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP
FELL APART TOO, HUH ?

10:57.720 --> 10:59.984
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY--

11:00.020 --> 11:02.818
YEAH.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.021
SORRY.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.790
THAN KS.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.300
HEY, DON'T FORGET TO BRING
BACK YOUR COFFEE CUP.

11:21.110 --> 11:23.442
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
COFFEE CUPS IN THIS KITCHEN.

11:23.480 --> 11:28.019
PEOPLE KEEP
LEAVING WITH THEM.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.993
A PLANE !

11:44.030 --> 11:45.918
A PLANE GOING
TO BURBANK AIRPORT,

11:45.970 --> 11:47.392
JUST BEFORE LANDING.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.135
THEY CALL IT
THE BLUE ICE.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.808
I DON'T KNOW.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.230
SOME BALL OF CHEMICAL FOR TOILET
OF AIRPLANE IT COME OFF,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.430
RIGHT ONTO ANAHID.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.005
IN OUR OWN YARD.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.348
ONE MINUTE I'M TALKING TO HER
ON TELEPHONE, NEXT MINUTE.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.416
( speaking Armenian )

12:03.450 --> 12:05.486
YOU BELIEVE THIS ?

12:05.520 --> 12:08.216
AND NOW I FINDING OUT
IT'S HAPPEN ALL THE TIME,

12:08.260 --> 12:10.785
BUT BIG COMPANIES

12:10.830 --> 12:12.081
SO PEOPLE LIKE ME

12:12.130 --> 12:14.496
THAT BLUE ICE

12:17.500 --> 12:18.762
HEY.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.131
HEY.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.330

12:28.040 --> 12:29.871
WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF
A FUCKING BUSINESS TO YOU.

12:29.910 --> 12:32.003
GODDAMN RIGHT
IT'S A BUSINESS !

12:32.050 --> 12:33.449
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M HERE FOR,
THE LOVE OF HUMANITY ?!

12:33.480 --> 12:35.414
YOU THINK
I WANT TO BE HERE,

12:35.450 --> 12:37.247
WITH PEOPLE ON THE WORST
FUCKING DAY OF THEIR LIVES ?!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.349
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOUR BOSS, PLEASE.

12:39.390 --> 12:41.119
I AM THE BOSS.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.025
AND I WANT YOU OUT OF
MY FUCKING ESTABLISHMENT, NOW !

12:45.090 --> 12:47.126
GO ON,

12:47.160 --> 12:50.266
I'LL HAVE YOUR WIFE BROUGHT
OVER TO WHEREVER YOU END UP.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.393
FREE OF FUCKING CHARGE.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.569
JUST OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY HEART,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.238
BECAUSE I'M IN THIS BUSINESS
BECAUSE I LOVE PEOPLE

12:56.270 --> 12:58.830
AND I LOVE
HELPING PEOPLE !

13:00.480 --> 13:02.334
I FELT SO FREE.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.574
YOU KNOW,
FOR LIKE A WEEK.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.202
BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WITHIN DAYS,

13:05.250 --> 13:06.877
IT WENT FROM YAY,
I'M INDEPENDENT

13:06.920 --> 13:08.376
TO HOLY FUCK,
I'M GOING TO DIE ALONE.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.344
I KEEP SWITCHING BACK
AND FORTH BETWEEN, YOU KNOW,

13:11.390 --> 13:14.018
WE'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER,
WE CAN GROW TOGETHER,

13:14.060 --> 13:16.449
INTO WHO WE FULLY ARE, TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW WHATI MEAN ?

13:16.490 --> 13:18.082
NOT REALLY.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.291
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
I COMPLETELY FLIP OVER

13:20.330 --> 13:22.195
TO WE'RE POISON FOR
EACH OTHER, THIS IS ABUSE.

13:22.230 --> 13:26.929
YOU ALWAYS GO THROUGH
TOUGH PATCHES, DAVID.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.165
YOU JUST HAVE
TO WORK THROUGH THEM.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.031
HAVE YOU AND VANESSA
EVER GONE THROUGH A TIME

13:31.070 --> 13:32.901
WHERE YOU FELT LIKE
BY STAYING WITH HER

13:32.940 --> 13:35.238
YOUR ENTIRE SENSE OF SELF
WAS GOING TO BE OBLITERATED ?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.248
UH...

13:37.280 --> 13:38.474
NO.

13:38.510 --> 13:39.841
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.178
VANESSA AND I
HAVE OUR ISSUES,

13:42.220 --> 13:46.543
MAINLY BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE
TRY TO COME BETWEEN US.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.615
WOULD THAT BE
ANGELICA ?

13:48.660 --> 13:52.426
I SWEAR, DAVID.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.849
I WISH I COULD JUST
KICK HER SORRY ASS OUT.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.095
THEN VAN ESSA ALWAYS
TAKES HER SIDE,

13:57.130 --> 13:59.098
IT'S LIKE I HAVE
A FUCKING TWO-HEADED WIFE.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.337
AS OPPOSED
TO A NO-HEADED WIFE.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.565
THAT'S GOOD.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.362
UNHOOK HER !
EXCUSE ME ?

14:05.410 --> 14:06.308
JUST FUCKING
UNHOOK HER !

14:06.340 --> 14:07.602
WHOA, WHOA, HEY !

14:07.640 --> 14:08.868
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU ?

14:08.910 --> 14:11.071
THE HUSBAND
CHANGED HIS MIND.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.510
OKAY, BUT WAIT UNTIL I GET
THE CANULA OUT OF HER.

14:13.550 --> 14:14.949
AND I SHOULD REALLY
ASPIRATE BEFORE WE MOVE HER.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.880
DID WE GET
OUTBID AGAIN ?

14:16.920 --> 14:20.959
YEAH, THE PRIEST OR PASTOR
OR WHATEVER FROM THEIR CHURCH

14:20.990 --> 14:23.379
WANTED TO USE A DIFFERENT PLACE,
AN ARMENIAN PLACE.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.159
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:25.190 --> 14:26.896
WELL, MAKE SURE WE CHARGE THEM
EXTRA FOR EMBALMING AND TRANSPO.

14:26.930 --> 14:30.127
I TOLD THEM
IT WOULD BE FREE.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.489
WHY DID YOU
DO THAT ?!

14:31.530 --> 14:34.192
YOU JUST LOST US
$500, NATE !

14:34.240 --> 14:35.969
BECAUSE I MADE
A MISTAKE, ALRIGHT ?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.059
YEAH, I MADE
A FUCKING MISTAKE !

14:38.110 --> 14:39.975
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT
OF MY FUCKIN' PAYCHECK ?!

14:40.010 --> 14:42.478
FUCK YOU GUYS !

14:45.280 --> 14:47.168
I'm so alone.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.279
You're not alone.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.446
You have me.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.311
Do I, Philip ?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.920
Do I really ?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.151
How can I ever trust you after
what happened in Budapest ?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.088
I had amnesia,
I'd been brainwashed !

15:02.130 --> 15:03.620
HEY.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.092
I NEED YOU
TO WATCH MAYA FOR ME.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.165
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.690
NATE, I WANT
TO HELP YOU,

15:07.740 --> 15:11.198
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE
DEALING WITH BUT I AM SERIOUSLY,

15:11.240 --> 15:13.276
AS OUT OF IT AS
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.572
I DON'T THINK MY ENERGY
WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR MAYA.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.271
YOU'RE BETTER
THAN ME.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.388
Well, maybe when it
comes to forgiving,

15:23.420 --> 15:25.980
you need to start
with yourself.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.679
( music )

15:49.580 --> 15:51.377
ONE MORE ?

15:51.410 --> 15:54.573
YEAH, DO YOU GUYS
SELL ANY FOOD HERE ?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.645
PEAN UTS.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.181
THEM EGGS
OVER THERE.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.711
I COULD
ORDER YOU A PIZZA.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.184
NO, I CAN'T EAT
A WHOLE PIZZA.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.094
I'LL HAVE
A SLICE WITH YOU.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.008
HAWAIIAN ?

16:17.040 --> 16:19.167
HAM AND PINEAPPLE ?

16:19.210 --> 16:25.274
SORRY, I'M NOT A PINEAPPLE
ON PIZZA KIND OF GUY.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.016
OH YEAH ?

16:27.050 --> 16:30.144
WHAT KINDA
A GUY ARE YA ?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.617
THE KIND OF GUY WHO WANTS
TO FUCK YOU SENSELESS.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.399
( French horn playing )

17:06.520 --> 17:07.509
AM I TOO LOUD ?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.811
OH, NO.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.350
I WAS JUST CURIOUS
WHAT THE SOUND WAS.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.755
FRENCH HORN.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.826
NOBODY EVER KNOWS
WHAT IT IS.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.293
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:15.330 --> 17:16.524
DON'T LIE,
THERE'S NO NEED.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.620
IT'S NOT ONE OF
THOSE INSTRUMENTS

17:19.670 --> 17:21.467
THAT'S MEANT
TO BE HEARD ALONE.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.264
OH, I'M BRENDA.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.307
JOE.

17:26.340 --> 17:27.637
HEY.
HEY.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.705
I JUST MOVED IN
A MONTH AND A HALF AGO.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.140
OH, WELCOME.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.738
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.146
SEEMS LIKE
A NICE ENOUGH PLACE.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.284
YEAH, I LIKE IT.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.153
PLUS, IT'S CHEAP SO
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK A LOT.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.728
I DO SESSION WORK MOSTLY,
BUT THESE DAYS MOST PEOPLE

17:44.760 --> 17:49.151
PREFER THE SYNTHESIZED
PSEUDO-HORN BY-PRODUCT
OF THAT OF AN ACTUAL HUMAN.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.724
DO I SOUND ANGRY ?

17:50.770 --> 17:51.794
'CAUSE I'M NOT ANGRY.

17:51.830 --> 17:54.162
NO, IT'S FINE,
IT'S NICE...

17:54.200 --> 17:55.531
TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

17:55.570 --> 17:58.368
JUST GET OUT OF PRISON ?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.105
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:00.140 --> 18:03.644
HAVE YOU FULLY CHECKED OUT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD YET ?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.102
FIGURED OUT
WHERE STUFF IS ?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.208
NAH.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.842
NAH ?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.485
NAH, I JUST MOSTLY
STAY AT HOME.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.183
WELL, IF YOU WANT
I'LL WALK YOU DOWN.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.384
BUT THERE'S SOME
GREAT LITTLE PLACES.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.557
THERE'S A GREAT
CUBAN BAKERY I LOVE,

18:19.590 --> 18:22.297
THEY MAKES REALLY GOOD
CAFE CON LECHE.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.427
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.438
OKAY.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.791
JUST TO GET THAT
OUT IN THE OPEN.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.865
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT WAS AN OPTION.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.468
IT'S NOT AN OPTION.

18:33.510 --> 18:34.704
I GOT IT.

18:34.740 --> 18:39.279
SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.184
IT'S JUST,
I'VE BEEN UM...

18:43.220 --> 18:46.246
CELIBATE FOR
QUITE A LONG TIME

18:46.290 --> 18:49.817
AND IT'S BEEN KIND OF
A GOOD THING FOR ME.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.591
AND YOU'RE REALLY
ATTRACTIVE.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.825
BUT YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT ?

18:55.860 --> 18:59.864
SO YEAH, I'LL HAVE
COFFEE WITH YOU,

18:59.900 --> 19:03.609
BUT I DON'T DRINK,
OR SMOKE POT.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.529
I'M PRETTY BORING,
ACTUALLY.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.777
SOMEHOW, I FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.213
WELL, THEN, UM...

19:13.250 --> 19:16.777
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU
AND YOUR HORN.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.217
YEAH.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.560
( tv chatter )

19:49.420 --> 19:50.318
HEY.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.649
TRAVIS, CLEAR OUT.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.908
MAMA'S GOT COMPANY.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.612
OKAY, I'M READY.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.464
IT'S LIKE TWO
IN THE MORNING !

20:45.510 --> 20:46.636
SHH, SHH, SHH.

20:46.670 --> 20:47.739
YOU LEFT AT
LIKE DINNERTIME !

20:47.780 --> 20:49.532
JUST GO BACK
TO SLEEP.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.610
GOD, YOU'RE
SO FUCKING SAD.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.958
I KNOW.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.981
WHAT ?

21:06.030 --> 21:07.292
NOTHING.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.820
I'M JUST HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.328
YOU ARE ?

21:11.370 --> 21:12.928
YEAH.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.467
I'M HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.042
CALL HIM.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.640
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.885
YEAH, BUT SHOULD I ?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.615
WHY NOT ?

21:36.660 --> 21:37.888
YOU MISS HIM.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.579
I MISS A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.029
I MISS YOU.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.426
YEAH, BUT YOU
REALLY MISS HIM.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.791
I MISS HAVING SEX
WITH HIM.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.024
YOU CAN HAVE SEX
WITH ANYBODY.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.334
YEAH, I DID THAT.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.507
I SAW.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.031
SLUT.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.606
( chuckling )

21:54.640 --> 21:58.371
SO, WHAT IF I JUST
SHUT THE DOOR ON KEITH ?

21:58.410 --> 21:59.843
LIKE HE'S DEAD TO ME.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.643
I'LL JUST END UP REPLACING HIM
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

22:01.680 --> 22:03.614
THE SAME WAY MOM IS
REPLACING YOU WITH GEORGE.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.789
IS THAT ALL LIFE IS ?

22:05.820 --> 22:07.458
WE JUST GO THROUGH IT
REPLACING PEOPLE ?

22:07.490 --> 22:08.957
PRETTY MUCH.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.878
SOME PEOPLE JUST DO IT FASTER
AND MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.023
DON'T TOUCH THOSE.

22:17.030 --> 22:20.693
GEORGE REMINDS ME
OF YOU, YOU KNOW.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.889
HUH.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.635
I DON'T REALLY
SEE THAT.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.535
JUST ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME SAD.

22:25.570 --> 22:29.472
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WISH I COULD
SEE YOU AND MOM TOGETHER AGAIN.

22:29.510 --> 22:32.399
WELL, THAT MAN
IS ALIVE,

22:32.450 --> 22:33.747
AND I'M DEAD.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.714
I THINK THAT
MEANS HE WINS.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.635
HEY, IT'S ME.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.695
LISTEN, I...

22:59.840 --> 23:03.901
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TO CHURCH
WITH ME THIS MORNING ?

23:03.950 --> 23:07.738
(tv) _
You have to be real qUIet,
so we can sneak up on him.

23:07.780 --> 23:10.943
I don't think he's
gonna like that.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.639
HEY.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.715
HEY.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.450
GOT ANOTHER BEER ?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.468
FRIDGE.

23:28.170 --> 23:31.139
Okay, but you gotta
stay real close,

23:31.170 --> 23:33.161
And keep quiet !

23:35.980 --> 23:37.208
WHATCHYA DOING ?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.741
WATCHING THE BABY.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.112
LITERALLY.

23:41.150 --> 23:44.187
AH, THE LITTLE ONES.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.586
THERE'S A REASON
TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.

23:46.620 --> 23:49.054
WHEN WE FORGET
OUR OWN REASONS.

23:49.090 --> 23:52.924
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO LAY
SOME SORT OF HOMESPUN WISDOM

23:52.960 --> 23:55.849
INSTANT BONDING
LOAD OF HORSESHIT
ON ME RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU ?

23:55.900 --> 23:58.926
BECAUSE THAT'D BE
SERIOUSLY OBNOXIOUS.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.097
WE'RE ALL VERY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, NATE.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.198
WE, WHO ?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.208
YOUR MOTHER,
YOUR FAMILY.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.901
WHICH, LIKE IT OR NOT,
I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.134
FUCK YOU.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.604
YOU NEED YOUR FAMILY NOW,
MORE THAN EVER.

24:12.950 --> 24:16.716
GEORGE, YOU CAN SIT IN OUR
GODDAMN TV ROOM AND RENT MOVIES,

24:16.750 --> 24:18.684
YOU CAN BONE MY MOTHER
DAY AND NIGHT IF YOU WANT TO,

24:18.720 --> 24:20.142
BUT DON'T YOU DARE
COME IN HERE

24:20.190 --> 24:21.748
AND ACT LIKE YOU'RE
MY FUCKING FATHER.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.918
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.521
IT'S TIME
FOR MAYA'S NAP.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.262
I ONLY WANTED TO--

24:35.300 --> 24:37.461
JUST LEAVE ME
THE FUCK ALONE, ALRIGHT ?!

24:50.990 --> 24:52.981
I'M SORRY, BABE.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.109
SORRY.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.558
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I SAW YOU.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.566
OUT THERE
IN THE PARKING LOT.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.737
REALLY ?

25:14.780 --> 25:16.771
I THOUGHT WE MET DOWNSTAIRS
AT THAT BUFFET THING ?

25:16.810 --> 25:18.675
YEAH, THAT'S
WHERE WE MET,

25:18.710 --> 25:20.610
BUT I HAD ALREADY
SEEN YOU A COUPLE TIMES.

25:20.650 --> 25:23.983
GETTING OUT OF
YOUR CAR, ALL STUDLY.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.087
YOU LOOKED
SO INTENSE.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.884
THE WAY YOU POINTED YOUR LITTLE
ALARM THINGY AT YOUR CAR,

25:29.920 --> 25:31.751
LIKE FUCK YOU CAR,
NOW YOU'RE LOCKED.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.052
PLEASE.

25:33.090 --> 25:36.127
THEN I REMEMBER SOMEBODY
TOLD ME YOU WERE A COP

25:36.160 --> 25:39.721
AND FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF SUNDAYS

25:39.770 --> 25:41.863
I TIMED IT SO
I'D PULL IN NEXT TO YOU.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.606
YOU WERE WATCHING ME ?

25:43.640 --> 25:46.165
YOU STALKER.

25:46.210 --> 25:49.134
I LOVED THAT
YOU WERE A COP.

25:49.180 --> 25:52.877
THE THOUGHT OF BEING
WITH YOU MADE ME FEEL SAFE,

25:52.910 --> 25:55.640
ALTHOUGH
I CAN'T IMAGINE

25:55.680 --> 25:57.682
WHAT I THOUGHT I NEEDED
PROTECTION FROM.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.588
I JUST LIKED KNOWING THAT YOU
WERE STRAPPED TO A GUN ALL DAY.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.657
I SAW YOU BEFORE
WE TALKED, TOO.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.783

STOP.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.298

STOP LOOKING AT YOU.

26:20.340 --> 26:23.741
THAT'S FUNNY.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.771
WHY IS THAT FUNNY ?

26:25.810 --> 26:28.574
DON'T YOU KNOW I THINK
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL ?

26:30.950 --> 26:33.282
NO.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.357
AND KIND, AND SMART,
AND LOVING ?

26:36.390 --> 26:38.187
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT ?

26:38.230 --> 26:41.825
NO.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.594
WELL, I DO.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.418

27:52.400 --> 27:54.231
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.

27:54.270 --> 27:58.468

27:58.510 --> 28:01.229
COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.877
SO HOW'S LIFE ?

28:05.910 --> 28:08.174
HOW'S DEATH ?

28:08.220 --> 28:09.869
IT'S GOOD, GOOD.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.309
I'VE MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS,
JOINED THE CHESS TEAM.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.157
I'M GLAD
YOU CAME TAY.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.385
WHY, IS THIS SOME KIND OF
SPECIAL OCCASION ?

28:18.430 --> 28:21.957
NOPE, IT'S LIKE

28:29.400 --> 28:31.732
HELLO, PRECIOUS GIRL.

I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE MARRYING GEORGE.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.310
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.988
I KNOW HE'S
A PRESUMPTUOUS,

28:47.020 --> 28:48.453

28:48.490 --> 28:51.084
PLUS HE'S SELFISH,
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.927
HOW IS HE SELFISH ?

28:52.960 --> 28:54.791
COME ON, MOM.

28:54.830 --> 28:56.821
HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.020
HE JUST WANTS YOU
ALL FOR HIMSELF !

28:58.070 --> 28:59.264
HE'S NOT EVEN
THINKING ABOUT

28:59.300 --> 29:00.892
HOW MUCH MAYA'S
GOING TO NEED YOU.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.158
MAYA'S GOING TO NEED STRONG,
HAPPY PEOPLE IN HER LIFE.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.462
AND I LOVE GEORGE

29:04.510 --> 29:06.364
AND I FEEL STRONG AND HAPPY
WHEN I'M WITH HIM.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.037
I THINK THAT
HELPS MAYA.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.809
IT'S A HELP TO MARRY
SOME TOTAL FUCKING STRANGER

29:09.840 --> 29:11.341
AND JUST GO OFF AND LEAVE MAYA
WITH NO FAMILY AT ALL ?

29:11.380 --> 29:14.213
I MEAN, JESUS CHRIST,
HER MOTHER IS FUCKING MISSING.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.138
MAYA STILL
HAS ONE PARENT !

29:16.180 --> 29:18.284
A LOT OF KIDS
DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT !

29:18.320 --> 29:22.882
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME UNTIL 2:30
IN THE MORNING LAST NIGHT.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.057
I HAD A SITTER.

29:24.090 --> 29:25.352
YOU HAD CLAIRE, NATE.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.051
YOU CAN'T KEEP
EXPECTING US TO BE THERE

29:27.090 --> 29:28.250
EVERY TIME YOU WANT
TO CHECK OUT.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.392
WHY THE FUCK NOT ?

29:29.430 --> 29:31.819
I STUCK AROUND
AFTER DAD DIED !

29:31.870 --> 29:33.838
YOU KNOW,
I HAD A LIFE !

29:33.870 --> 29:35.565
I WAS READY TO GO BACK
TO SEATTLE, BUT NO--

29:35.600 --> 29:37.033
I NEVER ASKED
YOU TO--

29:37.070 --> 29:39.334
YES, YOU DID,
YES, YOU DID !

29:39.370 --> 29:40.928
YOU ASKED ME
TO STICK AROUND.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.868
OH, I KNOW, IT'S JUST FOR
A FEW FUCKING DAYS, NATE,

29:42.910 --> 29:44.400
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
NOBODY IN IS FUCKING FAMILY

29:44.450 --> 29:46.907
CAN EVER SAY
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN !

29:46.950 --> 29:48.577
YOU KNOW YOU WANTED ME
TO STAY FOR GOOD,

29:48.620 --> 29:52.317
SO, DON'T YOU DARE
FUCKING ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T !

29:53.490 --> 29:55.151
GODDAMNIT !

29:55.190 --> 29:56.987
I CHANGED EVERYTHING IN
MY FUCKING LIFE BECAUSE OF YOU !

29:57.020 --> 29:59.079
AND MAYBE,
MAYBE IF I HADN'T,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.155
NONE OF THIS FUCKING SHIT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED !

30:01.200 --> 30:03.020
OH PLEASE.

30:03.060 --> 30:05.062
AND NOW WHEN I NEED YOU THE MOST
YOU REFUSE TO FUCKING HELP ME--

30:05.100 --> 30:06.499
HOW CAN I HELP YOU ?

30:06.530 --> 30:09.499
I'M ON THE SHORE TRYING
TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE WATER

30:09.540 --> 30:11.428
AND YOU'RE STRAPPING
ON LEAD BOOTS !

30:11.470 --> 30:13.028
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

30:13.070 --> 30:15.231
BUT WATCH YOU
SELF-DESTRUCT ?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.100
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.175
I WON'T DO THAT !

30:18.210 --> 30:19.609
FINE, MOM.
THANKS, MOM.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.072
THANKS FOR
FUCKIN' EVERYTHING.

30:30.990 --> 30:34.050
( sobbing )

30:58.620 --> 31:01.054
SO, THOSE ARE
ALL YOUR CATS ?

31:01.090 --> 31:03.650
NO, THEY'RE
THE BUILDING'S.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.955
BUT IF I DON'T FEED 'EM
THEY'RE GONNA EAT LIKE,

31:06.990 --> 31:09.151
DEAD DISEASED BIRDS
OR SOMETHING.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.464
SO, YOU'RE A GIVER.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.230
OH, YEAH,
I'M SO FUCKING NOBLE.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.330
NOT ENOUGH TO CATCH THEM
AND GET THEM SPAYED

31:18.370 --> 31:19.906
AND FIND THEM HOMES.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.100
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THEM IN YOURSELF ?

31:21.140 --> 31:23.608
I'M ALLERGIC.

31:28.420 --> 31:33.380
SORRY IF I UNLOADED TOO MUCH
PERSONAL STUFF ON YOU YESTERDAY.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.651
NO PROBLEM.

31:36.690 --> 31:39.352
SO, IS THE COFFEE THING
STILL AN OPTION ?

31:39.390 --> 31:42.154
SURE, IF YOU
WANT IT TO BE.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.998
YEAH, I DO.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.099
OKAY.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.334
NOW ?

31:49.370 --> 31:51.338
OH, YEAH, I COULD.

31:51.370 --> 31:52.962
OH NO,
THEY'RE CLOSED SUNDAY.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.534
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

31:54.580 --> 31:55.672
I HAVE TO DO
LAUNDRY TODAY.

31:55.710 --> 31:58.577
OH, SURE, OKAY,
THAT'S FINE.

31:58.610 --> 32:02.046
WELL, WE COULD
DO DINNER

32:03.450 --> 32:05.543
THERE'S A KOREAN BARBECUE
NEARBY, JUST OPENED UP.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.478
I DON'T REALLY
THINK THAT'S--

32:07.520 --> 32:10.353
THINK OF IT AS LUNCH
IN ANOTHER TIME ZONE.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.352
I ALREADY KNOW SEX
IS NOT AN OPTION.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.257
SURE, WHY NOT ?

32:16.300 --> 32:18.427
GOOD.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.478
MONKEYS ?

32:35.520 --> 32:38.512
WHAT, YOU THINK
MONKEYS DON'T DIE ?

32:42.320 --> 32:44.356
( male )
YEAH, ANTHONY,
GOOD CATCH, MAN.

32:44.390 --> 32:46.028
OVER HERE !

32:55.370 --> 32:56.769
HE'S DEAD ?

32:56.800 --> 32:59.268
DON'T ASK ME,
THIS IS YOUR THING.

33:01.140 --> 33:05.144
MAN, I WAS JUST
SO CONSTANTLY AGGRO.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.379
I COULDN'T RELAX.

33:09.420 --> 33:13.186
I WISH I COULD HAVE
HELPED YOU MORE.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.085
OH CLAIRE, COME ON.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.656
THERE WAS NOTHING
ANYBODY COULD DO.

33:16.690 --> 33:22.128
LIFE JUST WASN'T THE RIGHT
ENVIRONMENT FOR ME.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.189
BUT DON'T YOU
MISS IT ?

33:27.230 --> 33:30.734
NO, NOT REALLY.

33:30.770 --> 33:34.228
ACTUALLY, I LIKE IT
BETTERERE.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.077
I'M TAKING CARE
OF ANTHONY,

33:37.110 --> 33:39.305
AND I'M DOING THE WHOLE
HOME SCHOOL THING.

33:39.350 --> 33:43.172
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A PURPOSE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.745
I NEVER COULD'VE DONE THAT
WHEN I WAS ALIVE,

33:45.790 --> 33:47.746
I WAS JUST
SO FUCKING SELFISH.

33:47.790 --> 33:50.611
YEAH.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.752
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH
MY NIECE SOMETIMES,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.223
IT'S LIKE JUST BY
SPENDING TIME WITH HER

33:57.260 --> 34:00.525
I GET TO RE-EXPERIENCE
THE SORT OF ETERNAL

34:00.570 --> 34:02.492
YOUNG-NESS OF THINGS.

34:02.540 --> 34:07.705
BUT THEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
AND IT JUST GOES AWAY.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.719
SO...

34:15.750 --> 34:18.082
YA SEEING ANYBODY ?

34:18.120 --> 34:20.179
NO.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.122
I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.823
ALRIGHT, LET'S GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.396
COME ON.

34:30.430 --> 34:34.196
WELL, I GOTTA RUN--

34:34.240 --> 34:37.368
YEAH, OKAY.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.231
COME HERE.

34:49.550 --> 34:52.189
I LOVE YOU.

34:52.220 --> 34:56.111
I LOVE YOU TOO.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.252
OKAY !

35:03.300 --> 35:05.495
( laughing )

35:09.200 --> 35:11.407
AND IT WAS ALWAYS MORE
LIKE I HAD NO CHOICE,

35:11.440 --> 35:12.668
MY BELIEF
WAS ALL FEAR.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.405
YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE CATHOLIC THING,

35:14.440 --> 35:15.771
EVEN THOUGH
I'M EPISCOPALIAN.

35:15.810 --> 35:17.732
YOU HAVE TO DO RIGHT
OR YOU'LL BE PUNISHED.

35:17.780 --> 35:20.442
I GOT THAT TOO, ONLY NOT
FROM OUR RELIGION.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.913
FROM MY DAD.

35:21.950 --> 35:23.713
I MEAN, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD
DO THE RIGHT THING,

35:23.750 --> 35:25.149
BUT NOT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
GET REWARDED IN HEAVEN,

35:25.190 --> 35:26.782
THAT'S JUST LIKE,
BRIBERY.

35:26.820 --> 35:27.889
NO, WE SHOULD
DO THE RIGHT THING

35:27.920 --> 35:29.410
BECAUSE WE CAN
DO THE RIGHT THING.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.609
AND BECAUSE WE CHOOSE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

35:30.660 --> 35:32.548
EVEN IF IT'S GONNA
MAKE LIFE HARDER,

35:32.590 --> 35:33.522
WHICH IT OFTEN DOES.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.120
YEAH.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.806
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
RIGHT FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

35:44.840 --> 35:49.129
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S WRONG, EITHER.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.317
I'VE JUST BEEN SO UNHAPPY
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.625
I SLEPT WITH PATRICK.

36:18.870 --> 36:21.873
OKAY.

36:23.810 --> 36:25.869
OKAY, LOOK.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.605
LISTEN TO ME.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.311
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.

36:29.350 --> 36:32.217
AND I'LL DO ANYTHING I HAVE
TO DO TO WORK THROUGH THIS,

36:32.250 --> 36:34.457
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE YOU.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.928
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
ANYTHING.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.632
JUST DON'T GIVE UP.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.969
NOT YET.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.641
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

37:05.690 --> 37:07.544
I DON'T WANNA SIT AROUND
LIKE A PIG IN MY OWN FILTH

37:07.590 --> 37:09.751
FOR ONE SUNDAY
IF NOBODY MINDS.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.759
HEY, SWEETIE.

37:12.790 --> 37:14.792
WHY DON'T WE
GO TO CHURCH ?

37:14.830 --> 37:16.422
WHY DON'T WE
DO SOMETHING ?

37:16.460 --> 37:18.826
OH BABY, ANGIE JUST RENTED
THE KIDS A BUNCH OF MOVIES.

37:20.370 --> 37:21.632
WHOA.

37:21.670 --> 37:23.934
WHOA, ANGIE, HEY,
THAT'S NOT FOR KIDS.

37:23.970 --> 37:25.267
PUT ON SOMETHING ELSE.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.607
WHAT THEY GET,
THEY GET,

37:26.640 --> 37:27.766
WHAT THEY DON'T GET
GOES OVER THEIR HEADS ANYWAY

37:27.810 --> 37:29.004
SO, DON'T EVEN
STRESS ABOUT IT.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.302
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.477
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.000
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE POTTY.

37:33.050 --> 37:35.268
WILL YOU PUT IT
ON PAUSE ?

37:37.450 --> 37:38.439
HEY!

37:38.490 --> 37:39.548

37:48.630 --> 37:50.393
THAT IS IT,

37:50.430 --> 37:51.692

37:53.100 --> 37:54.761
SHE NEEDS TO FIND

37:54.800 --> 37:56.665
SHE'S BEEN PUTTING IT OFF,
SHE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING.

37:56.700 --> 37:57.837
WHY SHOULD SHE ?

37:57.870 --> 37:59.007

NOT GETTING THIS.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.973
THERE'S NOTHING TO GET.

39:12.010 --> 39:15.138
LISA, IF I'D KNOWN
YOU WERE GONNA DIE,

39:15.180 --> 39:17.114
I WOULD HAVE HUNG OUT
WITH YOU MORE.

39:17.150 --> 39:20.085
OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.818
YOU KNOW I MISS YOU

39:55.860 --> 39:56.918
LIKE ALL THE TIME.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.589
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

40:00.630 --> 40:04.623
IT'S SO WEIRD THAT
MOM'S GETTING MARRIED.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.059
IT'S LIKE...

40:07.100 --> 40:08.965
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
BEING ERASED OR SOMETHING.

40:09.000 --> 40:09.932
AREN'T YOU
PISSED OFF ?

40:09.970 --> 40:11.528
NAH, THAT'S YOU.

40:11.570 --> 40:14.676
I THINK THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

40:29.960 --> 40:34.499
( phone ringing )

40:44.940 --> 40:45.964
YEAH ?

40:46.010 --> 40:47.568
( male )
Mr. Fisher ?

40:47.610 --> 40:48.929
YEAH.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.675
This is
Deputy Wheeler

40:50.710 --> 40:52.678
from the Santa Barbara
Sheriff's Department.

40:52.710 --> 40:55.213
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you, Sir,

40:55.250 --> 40:58.708
you might want
to sit down.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.948
OKAY.

41:05.990 --> 41:08.652
We found
a body, sir,

41:08.700 --> 41:13.728
and it matches with
your wife's dental records.

41:13.770 --> 41:16.466
I'm so sorry.

41:18.570 --> 41:21.107
( Latin music playing )

41:31.180 --> 41:33.216
YOU READ ALL THESE
ARTICLES, YOU KNOW,

41:33.250 --> 41:37.118
HOW AUSTIN'S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS
HIP, HOT ENCLAVE OF ARTISTS,

41:37.160 --> 41:38.752
BUT GOD, IT WAS
MORE THAN JUST HOT.

41:38.790 --> 41:41.520
A MILLION DEGREES
AT ALL TIMES.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.199
I'D BE LAYING AROUND
MY APARTMENT GOING,

41:44.230 --> 41:47.620
"I KNOW I NEED TO EXPERIENCE
THAT EDGY LOCAL SONGWRITER

41:47.670 --> 41:49.831
"WHO'S PLAYING AT
THE FABULOUS NEW CLUB

41:49.870 --> 41:52.259
BUT I'M JUST
SO DAMN HOT."

41:52.310 --> 41:53.902
IS THAT WHY YOU
CAME BACK TO L.A. ?

41:53.940 --> 41:55.703
MY DAD GOT SICK.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.037
OH, I'M SORRY.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.969
HE DIED, ACTUALLY.

42:00.010 --> 42:02.114
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.243
OH THANK YOU,
IT'S OKAY.

42:04.280 --> 42:08.910
THE ODDEST PART IS THAT
I ACTUALLY RETURNED

42:08.960 --> 42:11.827
WITH THE INTENTION OF
RECONNECTING WITH MY FAMILY.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.249
AND THEN, WITHIN
A MATTER OF MONTHS,

42:14.290 --> 42:16.895
I'M IN THIS
PLACE WHERE...

42:16.930 --> 42:20.320
WITHOUT SAYING TOO MUCH
AGAIN AND SCARING YOU.

42:20.370 --> 42:23.259
SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

42:24.810 --> 42:28.837
I... I ACTUALLY
HAVE NO ONE.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.804
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER BEEN SO...

42:31.850 --> 42:35.274
BY MYSELF.

42:46.190 --> 42:48.055
I KNOW THAT ONE DAY
I NEED TO START--

42:48.090 --> 42:50.650
I WANT TO START
DATING AGAIN.

42:50.700 --> 42:53.828
FUCK DATING,
DATING IS STUPID.

42:53.870 --> 42:56.088
( laughing )

42:56.140 --> 43:00.008
BUT THIS IS A DATE.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.302
ISN'T IT, KIND OF ?

43:01.340 --> 43:03.376
WELL, IT IS IF
WE WANT IT TO BE.

43:03.410 --> 43:07.176
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE ?

43:08.410 --> 43:11.117
CAN I GET BACK
TO YOU ON THAT ?

43:11.150 --> 43:13.311
TAKE YOUR TIME.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.126
I KNOW THE WOMAN THAT
TEACHES SALSA ON TUESDAYS.

43:25.170 --> 43:27.161
SHE'S DELIGHTFUL.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.929
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

43:28.970 --> 43:30.096
I'M TAKING OFF.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.960
OKAY.

43:32.010 --> 43:34.308
I THINK THEY'RE USING THIS SPACE
FOR A PRIVATE PARTY TONIGHT,

43:34.340 --> 43:36.035
WE PROBABLY
SHOULD CLEAR OUT.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.776
OH, OKAY.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.116
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GET A DRINK ?

43:43.150 --> 43:44.742
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU HAVE SOME TIME.

43:44.790 --> 43:46.246
OH, MAN, I'VE GOT
NOTHING BUT TIME.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.110
THANK YOU.

43:48.150 --> 43:49.219
WHERE'S YOUR CAR ?

43:49.260 --> 43:50.386
IN THE LOT.

43:50.420 --> 43:51.819
WHY DON'T YOU
FOLLOW ME ?

43:51.860 --> 43:53.020
OKAY.

43:53.060 --> 43:55.722
* YOU AIN'T GOT
NO WORRY *

44:09.910 --> 44:12.071
SO, WHAT'LL IT BE ?

44:12.110 --> 44:15.409
A SHOT OF TEQUILA.

44:15.450 --> 44:18.374
( Nate )
YOU WANT TO GET TO YOUR
SISTER'S BEFORE DARK, RIGHT ?

44:18.420 --> 44:20.638
YOU WANT
TO GET RID OF ME.

44:24.190 --> 44:26.658
KEEP IT COMING.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.109
HI, MOM.

44:53.150 --> 44:54.481
HELLO, DEAR.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.080
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

44:59.490 --> 45:02.152
HOW LONG BEFORE
WE LEAVE ?

45:02.200 --> 45:05.795
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

45:05.830 --> 45:07.320
OH GOOD.

45:07.370 --> 45:09.258
I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GONNA BE LATE.

45:09.300 --> 45:13.361
DO YOU WANT ME TO PACK UP
THE VIDEO CAMERA ?

45:13.410 --> 45:15.833
NO, THEY PROVIDE THAT
AT THE CHAPEL.

45:15.880 --> 45:19.202
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD
TAKE CARE OF MAYA TONIGHT,

45:19.250 --> 45:20.274
AT THE WEDDING ?

45:20.310 --> 45:22.278
GEORGE HAS HER
RIGHT NOW.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.118
WHERE'S NATE ?

45:25.150 --> 45:27.186
I HAVE NO IDEA.

45:27.220 --> 45:30.849
I'VE TRIED CALLING
HIS CELL PHONE ALL AFTERNOON

45:30.890 --> 45:33.029
BUT THERE'S NO ANSWER.

45:37.830 --> 45:40.867
OH, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.943
THEY'RE ANTIQUE,
SO THEY'RE OLD,

45:51.980 --> 45:53.845
BUT I JUST BOUGHT THEM,
SO THEY'RE ALSO NEW.

45:53.880 --> 45:56.246
AND TECH NICALLY
I'M GIVING THEM TO YOU,

45:56.280 --> 45:57.941
RATHER THAN LETTING YOU
BORROW THEM, BUT.

45:57.980 --> 46:00.949
THEY'RE BLUE, RIGHT ?

46:03.320 --> 46:05.049
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

46:05.090 --> 46:07.354
I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU
FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE.

46:07.390 --> 46:11.326
THANK YOU, MY SWEET
DARLING CLAIRE.

46:11.360 --> 46:15.467
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME...

46:15.500 --> 46:17.889
FROM YOU.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.271
DO YOU LIKE THEM ?

46:28.310 --> 46:29.538
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

46:29.580 --> 46:33.209
PRETTY.

46:33.250 --> 46:36.287
( music )

46:46.430 --> 46:49.228
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, KID,
JUST A PLACE TO GET A DRINK.

46:49.270 --> 46:51.534
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I JUST...

46:51.570 --> 46:53.367
I JUST NORMALLY
DON'T DO THIS.

46:53.410 --> 46:57.835
THESE LADIES,
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

47:20.270 --> 47:23.137
( cheering )

47:26.640 --> 47:28.608
SO...

47:35.480 --> 47:38.142
THAT WASN'T A KISS.

47:38.180 --> 47:40.080
NO.

47:40.120 --> 47:43.112
BUT IT WAS CLOSE.

47:51.300 --> 47:52.619
GOODNIGHT.

47:52.670 --> 47:54.467
GOODNIGHT.

48:11.350 --> 48:13.409
HI.

48:13.450 --> 48:15.384
OH, HEY.

48:15.420 --> 48:17.479
I'M INFINITY.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.954
HI, I'M RICO.

48:19.990 --> 48:21.628
HI.

48:21.660 --> 48:24.026
THIS IS A GREAT SONG !

48:24.060 --> 48:27.496
YEAH, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA DANCE AGAIN ?

48:27.530 --> 48:29.464
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A GREAT DANCER.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.491
SOON, DON'T WORRY.

48:31.540 --> 48:34.566
MY REAL NAME
IS SOPHIA.

48:34.610 --> 48:37.272
BUT YOU GOT
TO CALL ME INFINITY.

48:37.310 --> 48:39.346
HOW COME ?

48:39.380 --> 48:41.200
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S THE RULES.

48:41.250 --> 48:45.949
I'M SORRY, I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS BEFORE.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.480
( laughing )

48:47.520 --> 48:50.489
DUH !

48:55.530 --> 48:59.318
WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA DANCE AGAIN ?

48:59.370 --> 49:02.032
( laughing )

49:18.680 --> 49:21.979
COULD YOU PLEASE
STOP DOING THAT ?

49:23.590 --> 49:26.320
IF YOU CAN GIVE ME
A GOOD REASON TO.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.555
BECAUSE IT'S DRIVING ME
FUCKING CRAZY.

49:28.590 --> 49:32.128
NOT A GOOD
ENOUGH REASON.

49:45.180 --> 49:47.740
WHAT THE FUCK IS
YOUR PROBLEM, ASSHOLE ?

49:47.780 --> 49:50.146
YOU'RE MY PROBLEM,

49:51.820 --> 49:55.415
HOW'S YOUR PROBLEM NOW,

50:36.300 --> 50:40.066
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.261
TO SEE JOY
THROUGH YOUR EYES,

50:42.300 --> 50:45.167
TO FEEL SORROW
THROUGH YOUR HEART,

50:45.210 --> 50:49.078
TO SHARE ALL THE WONDERS
OF EXISTENCE WITH YOU,

50:49.110 --> 50:51.328

54:48.950 --> 54:50.645
ADJACENTLY

54:50.680 --> 54:51.840
SEE, THAT'S PICKING.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.347
I WAS NOT PICKING,

55:34.490 --> 55:36.629
THERE'S A PART THAT GOES
RIGHT OVER THE CANYON.

55:36.660 --> 55:37.752
THE GUARD RAIL'S OUT.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.597

I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.101
