WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:06.423
- That was my dorm hallway
and this is my fancy dorm.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.259
Check out the exquisite
craftsmanship.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.553
- I'll bet even the knock
sounds expensive.

00:11.636 --> 00:14.973
[knocking on door]
Sounds like Beverly Hills.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.058
- I can see why
you came to Wentworth.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.769
Not only will it help you
get to the pros,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.479
but this place
is pretty sweet.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.773
- No way.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.110
There must be like $500 worth
of tropical fish in here.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.779
Oh, hey, that one's floating.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.489
Oh...

00:31.573 --> 00:33.783
No way.

00:33.867 --> 00:38.455
There must be like $465 worth
of tropical fish in there.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.707
- Yeah, pretty fancy, right?
And guess what they eat.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.292
French truffles.
- What?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.960
- No way.
- Are you serious?

00:44.043 --> 00:45.712
- Nah, nah,
I'm just kidding.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.338
I'm not sure
what they eat.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.507
- Well, that explains
the floater.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.135
- Whoa, nice TV.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.930
- Yep, it's HD3D KYHOF.
- Wait, what's KYHOF?

00:56.014 --> 00:59.184
- Keep Your Hands Off Fool.
- Oh.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.812
- Oh, my gosh,
this bed is awesome.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.858
The memory foam
is to die for.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.860
Oh, no, I'm sinking in!

01:08.943 --> 01:11.696
I might get stuck
in here forever.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.781
But I'm okay with that.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.992
- [text bings]
- That's my mom.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.660
Time for us to go, guys.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.953
I have to get back for
my end of the summer

01:19.037 --> 01:22.332
girls' night
with Sophie and Pepper.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.917
I'm gonna miss you, Troy.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.335
- I'm gonna miss y'all, too.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.337
I mean, I can't believe
I don't know anyone here.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.963
I'm gonna have to make
all new friends.

01:29.047 --> 01:29.798
It's just weird, you know?

01:29.881 --> 01:32.342
- Oh, you'll be
all right, bro.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.718
So maybe we can
come visit some time?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.054
- Yeah, I'd love that.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.722
All right, now get outta here
before I get all misty-eyed.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.808
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, guys.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.892
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, you, too.

01:40.975 --> 01:44.020
- Oh, uh, I forgot
to say goodbye.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.688
- Aw, bring it in,
little man.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.232
- Excuse me.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.025
[voice cracking]
Goodbye.

01:49.108 --> 01:49.692
I'm gonna miss you.

{\an8}Check it out.

02:40.785 --> 02:44.247
{\an8}Well, what do you think?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.249
{\an8}- I love it.
- What?

02:46.332 --> 02:48.084
{\an8}Seriously, mama,
did you do all that?

02:48.167 --> 02:49.961
{\an8}- Yeah, I did.
It took me five months.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.379
{\an8}- Five months?

02:51.462 --> 02:55.592
{\an8}- Yeah, football has really

02:55.675 --> 02:57.093
{\an8}This is fun.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.761
{\an8}In fact, I would say
this girls' night

02:58.845 --> 03:00.430
{\an8}has been kind of perfect.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.307
- It has.
- [doorbell rings]

03:02.390 --> 03:04.100
- Speaking of perfect.
There's the pizza--finally.

03:04.183 --> 03:07.353
My body was starting
to eat itself alive.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.273
- Maybe the perfect
girls' night will continue

03:10.356 --> 03:14.819
with the perfect
super-cute pizza boy.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.613
- BELLA: Oooh!

03:16.696 --> 03:19.282
- Dang, girl, he must
be a supermodel.

03:19.365 --> 03:19.949
- He's Zach Barnes.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.119
- Zach Barnes? He's cute.

03:23.202 --> 03:27.290
I mean, Zach Barnes?
Arrgghh!

03:27.373 --> 03:29.208
- You cannot be serious.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.627
- I haven't seen that
jerk since last year

03:30.710 --> 03:32.086
when he bailed on
our Homecoming date.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.298
- Yeah, just because
you beat his team.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.215
What a butt-knuckle.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.009
- Not to downplay
how terrible it was,

03:38.092 --> 03:40.470
but he's out there
with our pizza

03:40.553 --> 03:43.473
and I'm crazy hungry, so...

03:43.556 --> 03:45.308
- Okay, um, you guys
get the door.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.770
He doesn't know you
and I don't wanna see him, so...

03:52.398 --> 03:54.150
- Hey, did you girls
order a pizza?

03:54.233 --> 03:55.485
- Yeah, did you order
a door in the face?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.320
- ZACH: What?
- [door slams]

03:57.403 --> 03:59.197
- Shutting off the porch light.
[clicks switch]

03:59.280 --> 04:00.156
- So you might wanna
watch out for the--

04:00.239 --> 04:03.660
- ZACH: [high-pitched squeal]
- Cactus.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.702
- Thanks for getting
rid of him.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.664
- My pleasure.
- And now back to girls' night.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.500
Mmmm, this pizza
smells so good.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.918
Hey.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.253
- I'm not eating anything
associated with Zach Barnes!

04:14.337 --> 04:16.547
- Yeah. Me neither.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.423
Aw...

04:21.260 --> 04:22.053
- And, if you get hungry,

04:22.136 --> 04:23.805
the cafeteria has
free food delivery

04:23.888 --> 04:26.057
all day or night.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.058
Just pick up the room
phone and dial.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.478
- Oh, what can I get?
- Anything.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.564
For example, seven corn dogs
at 1:00 in the morning.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.651
- What? Who would ever
order that? [laughs]

04:39.612 --> 04:41.948
Did...did you enjoy them?

04:42.031 --> 04:44.492
- So good.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.662
And those Wentworth tablets
come preloaded with

04:47.745 --> 04:48.538
all your textbooks
and football playbooks.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.541
- Ah, awesome.
Hey, what's this app do?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.043
- [farting noise]
- BOTH: [laughing]

04:54.127 --> 04:56.045
- That's the fart machine.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.463
And I have an app
that can do this.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.093
- Ah, room remote.
Impressive.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.721
Here, let me give
it a try.

05:04.804 --> 05:09.726
- [mellow jazz music]
- [fire crackling]

05:09.809 --> 05:12.103
- Uh. Heh.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.398
- That was...
- [music &amp; fire stop]

05:15.481 --> 05:17.400
- I'm sure you'll
get the hang of it.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.818
- Yeah, yeah.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.528
Uh, thanks for showing
me the ropes, Rufus.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.238
It's not easy
being the new guy.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.740
- It's cool. I was the new
guy last year.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.616
So I know what it's like to have
to make all new friends.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.035
- Don't forget
your old friends!

05:27.118 --> 05:31.247
Ha! Ha!
- We're back, sucka!

05:31.330 --> 05:33.166
- Hey, I knew you guys
would be back.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.917
I didn't know it
would be the same day.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.420
- Hi, I'm Troy's friend Newt.
- Hi, I'm Troy's roommate.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.090
First name Rufus, last name...
- [farting noise]

05:41.174 --> 05:43.009
- SAWYER: [laughing]
Oh, nice.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.094
I'm Troy's other friend.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.471
First name Sawyer.
Last name--

05:46.554 --> 05:50.349
- Man, if you're not
usin' the app, stop!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.018
- Hey, I'm gonna meet
some of the team

05:52.101 --> 05:53.478
for dinner in the cafeteria.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.606
Do you guys wanna come?
- Nah, nah, we're good.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.691
We'll order from the cafeteria
delivery service. Thanks.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.276
- Cool. Well,
nice meeting you guys.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.528
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.615
- Ah, yes,
this is Mr. Dixon.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.366
Um, I'll take three
bacon cheeseburgers

06:07.450 --> 06:09.452
and three root beers.
- SAWYER: Ohhh...

06:09.535 --> 06:11.287
- Also, do you have
any suggestions

06:11.370 --> 06:13.790
on what to feed the fish?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.249
The flaky stuff?

06:15.333 --> 06:18.628
Shoot, I thought that
was for the pizza.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.006
- A lion? A tiger? A liger?

06:22.090 --> 06:25.635
- A dirty rotten cobra.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.930
- That thing clearly
has legs.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.308
- I think she's
talking about Zach. Again.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.811
- Look at me.
I'm a pizza guy now.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
Aren't I special?

06:36.395 --> 06:38.481
[tsk'ing] Dork.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.650
- Bella, if you don't let
this Zach Barnes thing go,

06:40.733 --> 06:42.652
it'll eat away
at you forever.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.654
Like the hunger pains
in my stomach

06:44.737 --> 06:47.406
after you threw
out the pizza.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.074
- Yeah, ever since
Zach showed up,

06:48.157 --> 06:50.660
you've been a mess.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.663
- Sorry. I won't
let him ruin tonight.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.872
So, who wants
to watch a movie?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.875
- We have "Not Boyfriend
Material" and "He's the Worst."

06:57.959 --> 07:00.670
- [groaning]

07:00.753 --> 07:02.421
- Sorry, I rented
these before I knew

07:02.505 --> 07:03.422
who the pizza
guy would be.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.591
- Bella, if you wanna
get past Zach,

07:05.675 --> 07:07.510
you need to get
revenge on him.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.512
Make him feel as bad
as he made you feel.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.304
- Yeah, it would be
fun to torture him.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.349
But I really want
an apology.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.392
- [gasping] I know
what you should do.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.895
Order another pizza.
Extra cheese.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.689
- How does that solve
her Zach problem?

07:19.772 --> 07:23.192
- It doesn't.
Who wants mushrooms?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.361
- Wait. But it could.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.822
Ordering another pizza
will get Zach back here.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.866
And as soon as he sees me,
he'll feel guilty,

07:29.949 --> 07:33.661
and give me the apology he
should have given me last year.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.163
- I know you're talking,
but all I hear is...

07:35.246 --> 07:37.498
"Pizza, pizza, pizza."

07:41.669 --> 07:45.506
- Ah, this dress code
is gonna be a breeze.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.218
As soon as I learn
how to tie this tie.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.720
- Sorry, Troy, I'd help,

07:50.803 --> 07:52.096
but I'm trying to find
you a good slumber number.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.556
- Uh, I think I'm a three.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.892
- No, no, no, you may
think you're a three.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.604
But you're actually...
[snoring]

07:59.687 --> 08:03.900
Oooh! Sorry!
I fell asleep for a second.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.651
This bed is amazing.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.571
- All right, look, it was good
of you guys to stop by.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.699
But I have a team meeting
to get ready for, so...

08:11.782 --> 08:13.451
Hey! Hey! Hey, man,
take it easy.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.870
I don't want the team
to think I'm messy.

08:15.953 --> 08:16.787
- Oh, no problem.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.664
I was just about to
vacuum anyway. Hm.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.048
- [motor whirring,
sizzling]

08:27.131 --> 08:28.341
- Oh, poor thing.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.636
At least he died
doing what he loves.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.136
- When are your parents coming
to pick you guys up?

08:33.221 --> 08:36.974
- I forget. Let me check.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.562
- Oh! Nothing like hot sauce
on an open blister.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.273
I, uh, guess you guys
are still here, huh?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.274
- Yeah, I know.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.985
Look, I love 'em,
but I've gotta say

08:48.069 --> 08:49.779
I'm kinda looking forward
to them leaving

08:49.862 --> 08:51.113
so I can settle in
with the new team, you know?

08:51.197 --> 08:54.367
- Yeah, that'd be good.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.452
- My mom just talked
to Newt's dad

08:56.535 --> 08:59.413
and we can stay
the whole weekend! Yes!

08:59.497 --> 09:02.792
- Yay.
- Woo!

09:02.875 --> 09:04.752
Would you look
at that, Troy.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.879
Little guy's droolin'
all over your pillow.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.635
- Okay, guys, let's go over
the plan for when Zach arrives.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.636
- You're going to get the door.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.305
- And we'll give you
and Zach some space.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.348
- Right and as soon
as he sees

09:17.431 --> 09:19.976
my "You know what
you did" face,

09:20.059 --> 09:21.185
he'll melt into
a puddle of apologies.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.771
We may hug, we may not hug.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.106
And he might even go
as far as to ask me out.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.483
But I'll say "no"

09:27.567 --> 09:29.527
because I have far
too much self respect.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.528
- Yeah, you do, mama.
- [palm slap]

09:30.611 --> 09:33.531
- [laughing] I am so excited
for this pizza--

09:33.614 --> 09:36.325
uh, guy to apologize.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.160
- [doorbell rings]
- He's here.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.204
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.499
- [exhales forcefully]

09:43.582 --> 09:46.127
- Hey, Bella.
It's good to see you.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.628
- Zach.

09:47.712 --> 09:53.092
- Uh, okay, well,
here's your pizza.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.219
- And?

09:55.303 --> 09:58.431
- And that'll be $15.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.727
- Don't you have
something to say?

10:02.810 --> 10:07.148
- I thought I already
said it.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.735
- Unbelievable.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.236
- What?
- [door slams]

10:12.320 --> 10:14.530
- I can't believe it.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.533
That loser didn't apologize
and I did--

10:17.616 --> 10:18.534
three times!

10:18.617 --> 10:21.412
Oh, but I know what
to do now.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.331
- PEPPER: Eat?
- Get my revenge.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.665
- Sweet!
- Cool.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.544
So, you guys want
any plates or...?

10:28.627 --> 10:31.005
Yep, throwin' this away.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.551
- Okay, Sophie, revenge.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.011
Give me your worst.
- Okay.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.930
The perfect revenge is something
Zach will never forget.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.725
Something that hits
him where it hurts.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.935
- I've got it--
we get on that phone,

10:45.019 --> 10:46.562
place the biggest,
heaviest order we can

10:46.645 --> 10:48.064
and make Zach
bring it to us.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.317
I'm talking like three extra
large pizzas, cheesy sticks,

10:51.400 --> 10:53.527
garlic knots with
little Italian meats.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.779
Maybe some salad.
- Pepper!

10:54.862 --> 10:58.616
If you're so hungry,
eat something. Have a banana.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.787
That was perfect pizza!
Pizza, pizza, pizza!

11:02.870 --> 11:05.790
- Wait, okay, Pepper might
be onto something.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.416
We're going to make
this the worst night

11:07.500 --> 11:09.668
of Zach's pizza-
delivering life.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.296
Pass me my phone, Soph.
- [phone clatters]

11:12.380 --> 11:15.257
- Sorry. Reflex.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.551
I'm so hungry.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.681
- Vitale's Pizza?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.267
I placed an order tonight
and when it got here,

11:25.351 --> 11:28.646
it was completely
messed up.

11:28.729 --> 11:33.526
Why thank you.
I would like a replacement.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.445
- [doorbell rings]

11:36.529 --> 11:38.781
- Um, hi.
So here's your new pizza.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.700
I'm sorry for
the mix-up. Bye.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.620
- Wait, wait, wait, there's not
enough mushrooms on here.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.497
- Yeah, we ordered
"Mushroom Lover's"

11:46.580 --> 11:48.958
not "Mushroom Liker's."

11:49.041 --> 11:52.711
- What?
- Take it back, pizza boy.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.463
- Oh, and by the way,
we moved that--

11:54.547 --> 11:56.173
- ZACH: Ow!
- Cactus.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.466
- ALL: [laughing]

11:57.550 --> 12:00.344
- Here he comes.
Hit it.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.179
- ZACH: Ah, the sprinkler!

12:02.263 --> 12:04.932
- ALL: [laughing]

12:06.517 --> 12:08.727
- [water splashes]
- SOPHIE: Oh!

12:08.811 --> 12:10.729
- This pizza's all wet.
- So am I.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.316
- Take it back, pizza boy.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.194
- ALL: [laughing]
- [palm slaps]

12:18.737 --> 12:20.489
- Shouldn't Zach
be here by now?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.658
- Oh, Zach's not coming here.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.035
I placed an order that sent him
to the neighbors' house.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.037
- Why would you do that?

12:27.121 --> 12:27.913
- They have a pit bull

12:27.997 --> 12:30.666
and he loves chasing
delivery boys.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.335
- [dog barking]
- ZACH: [screaming]

12:33.419 --> 12:35.838
- ALL: [laughing]

12:35.921 --> 12:37.840
- You're right, Sophie,
revenge is fun.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.886
- SOPHIE: [sighing]
So good.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.722
- Yes, that's one
banana-nut muffin,

12:44.805 --> 12:47.892
one very large hot chocolate
and a dozen hot wings.

12:47.975 --> 12:51.854
Oh, wait. Troy, you want
some hot wings?

12:51.937 --> 12:52.938
- No.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.525
- Your mouth says "no,"
but your stomach says,

12:56.609 --> 12:59.737
"Want more wings!"
[laughing]

12:59.820 --> 13:01.530
Make that two dozen
hot wings.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.907
And do you know
what, Kelly?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.533
Why don't you get
something for yourself?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.367
Just put it on my tab.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.786
- You don't have a tab.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.455
- You know what?
You're right.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.375
Put it on Troy's tab.
Thanks, Troy.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.544
- Guys, this bed
is so good,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.380
I was dreaming
about sleeping.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.300
Wait, is this real?
Am I here?

13:21.383 --> 13:23.219
Who cares?

13:25.554 --> 13:26.222
- TROY: I can't
believe these guys.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.557
- It happens.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.518
Your squad comes to visit and
act like they're on vacation.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.602
- What am I supposed to do?

13:31.685 --> 13:34.396
I can't just kick
'em out, you know?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.856
They're my boys.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.902
But maybe I can make it hard
for them to want to stay.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.531
- [loud drumming music]
- Turn it up!

13:43.614 --> 13:44.698
- Sorry, Newt. Ha.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.574
Didn't mean to
disturb your sleep.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.701
Hope it's not
too loud for ya.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.787
- No way. I am
feelin' this track.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.916
Watch out. Newt's gettin'
it turned up.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.793
- OTHERS: [laughing]
- Ready?

13:55.876 --> 13:59.421
- TROY: Newt, no.
- NEWT: [laughing]

13:59.505 --> 14:01.924
- Last time. No.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.426
- [motorcycle engine revving]

14:04.510 --> 14:06.428
- [turns off TV]

14:06.512 --> 14:08.764
- [dramatic music]
- [turns off TV]

14:08.847 --> 14:10.808
- What?
- [dramatic music]

14:10.891 --> 14:11.767
- [turns off TV]
- Hey!

14:11.850 --> 14:15.229
Troy, I think
your TV's broken.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.272
- Oh, so unfortunate.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.816
Well, I guess there's no
reason to stay anymore.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.652
- [knock at door]
- Unless the food's here!

14:21.735 --> 14:23.821
- This ends now.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.241
- [mellow jazz music]
- Ooh, "Quiet Storm," okay?

14:29.493 --> 14:31.704
Hello?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.418
Troy, this music
is perfect,

14:37.501 --> 14:38.460
'cause I'm about
to make out--

14:38.544 --> 14:40.212
with these hot wings.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.422
Thank you.

14:41.505 --> 14:45.676
- Ooh, pillow dance.

14:45.759 --> 14:49.054
- I'm glad that's
not my pillow.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.472
- Oh, Troy,
I've got your wings.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.807
Catch!

14:51.890 --> 14:53.559
- [basket thuds]

14:53.642 --> 14:57.771
- Are you kidding me?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.983
- Zach's not gonna
know what hit him

15:01.066 --> 15:03.652
when that door opens.
- [plastic blasters clicking]

15:03.736 --> 15:06.113
- The wrath of a girl scorned.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.365
- And the wrath of
a girl starved.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.992
- [doorbell rings]

15:10.075 --> 15:13.329
- You can take the kneecaps,
I'll take the rest.

15:18.334 --> 15:22.463
- Unarmed!

15:22.546 --> 15:24.506
- You're not Zach.

15:24.590 --> 15:28.344
- Nope, I'm Lavelle.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.055
So, one large pepperoni with
sausage, ham, meatballs,

15:31.138 --> 15:34.266
Canadian bacon, chicken
and shrimp pizza.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.478
It sounds delicious.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.520
That'll be $22.73.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
- Uh, but where's Zach?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.317
- Zach's fired.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.486
That'll be $22.73.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.945
- Fired? Why was he fired?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
- He had a ton of
customer complaints

15:49.114 --> 15:49.782
and returned pizzas tonight,

15:49.865 --> 15:51.617
and the manager
had enough.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.911
Too bad. He was a good kid.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.455
Didn't deserve
to go out like that.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.876
That'll be $22.73.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.671
- Oh, my gosh, that's awful.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.506
- I just wanted to
teach Zach a lesson,

16:05.589 --> 16:07.216
not make him lose his job.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.052
- I mean, I'm all
for revenge, but...

16:10.135 --> 16:12.388
maybe we went
a little too far.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.807
- We should figure out a way
to get Zach his job back.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.100
Agree?
- SOPHIE &amp; PEPPER: Agreed.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.144
- That'll be--
- ALL: $22.73!

16:21.146 --> 16:22.940
- There's an extra
five bucks for you

16:23.023 --> 16:25.275
if you've got some
garlic knots in your car.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.652
- No garlic knots,

16:26.735 --> 16:28.278
but I've got some
old parmesan packets

16:28.362 --> 16:30.989
in my glove compartment.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.326
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.831
- Okay, I think
my plan is working.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.207
- It better 'cause
I need to get some sleep.

16:43.293 --> 16:46.380
- No TV, no stereo,
no food service.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.049
My dorm has turned into a pretty
lame hangout spot, huh?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.427
- Dude, don't even
worry about it.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.428
- Yeah, check it out.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.097
We gave the fish voices.
You're gonna love it.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.014
- Pardon me, fish friend,

16:56.098 --> 16:57.808
can you point your
way to the restroom?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.810
- Uh, you're swimming
in it, sir.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.938
- SAWYER &amp; NEWT:
[laughing]

17:03.021 --> 17:03.939
- Now you try, Troy.
It's fun.

17:04.021 --> 17:07.818
- Guys, it's time
for you to go.

17:07.901 --> 17:11.696
- Which fish voice was that?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.949
- Oh, probably that
snooty angelfish.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.117
- Yeah, he's always
swimming around

17:15.200 --> 17:18.078
like he's got a spear gun stuck
up his you-know-what.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.873
It's very intimidating
to the other fish in the tank.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.875
- It's not a fish,
man, it's me.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.961
Can't you guys
take a hint?

17:26.044 --> 17:27.212
Let me move on
with my new life.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.924
Look, I powered down all the
electronics with my tablet.

17:31.008 --> 17:31.842
And I called Kelly
in the cafeteria

17:31.925 --> 17:34.261
and told her to
freeze my account.

17:34.344 --> 17:38.140
- [gasping]
You called Kel-Kel?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.349
- Does this mean you don't
think you have bedbugs?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.019
- No!

17:42.102 --> 17:44.813
But I do think you
were taking certain...

17:44.897 --> 17:48.817
unforgiveable liberties
with my pillow.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.737
- If you want us to go,
we'll go.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.155
We're only here because
this morning

17:53.238 --> 17:55.949
you said it was lonely
being the new guy in school.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.159
- Yeah, we thought we could
help ease you into

17:57.242 --> 18:00.162
the new school year by making
it feel more like home.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.831
- Sorry for getting
on your nerves.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.417
We'll leave.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.296
- Guys, wait.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.966
I didn't know that that's
what you were trying to do.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.344
Even though you were
getting on my nerves,

18:15.427 --> 18:20.557
having you around has made
me feel less...lonely.

18:20.641 --> 18:25.813
So, thank you and I'm
sorry I yelled at you.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.356
- Um, I just wanted
to apologize for

18:27.439 --> 18:31.860
any actions I may have
taken with your pillow.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.653
- You know what?
We should call it a night.

18:32.736 --> 18:36.281
- Yeah! Dibs on the bed!

18:38.158 --> 18:40.369
- Yeah, you're right.
You should probably take it.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.540
- And I believe this
belongs to you.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.712
- Okay, the plan
is we call Vitale's,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.172
apologize profusely,

18:52.256 --> 18:55.259
and beg them to give
Zach his job back.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.385
- And if that fails,
we get him a job

18:56.468 --> 18:58.804
spinning a sign outside
my dad's dental office.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.055
- That sounds so lame.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.682
- Hey, he gets free floss.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.684
- Oh, that makes it better.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.686
- [doorbell rings]

19:08.355 --> 19:12.234
- Zach, I heard what happened
and I am so sorry.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.527
We were just about
to call the restaurant and--

19:13.610 --> 19:16.405
- Hey, look, don't bother.
- Oh, no, it's that bad?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.532
- No, Bella, I didn't
really get fired.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.325
Look! Gotcha! Ha.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.038
Ha? Ha?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.791
- I was actually
worried about you.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.334
- Hey, look, I only
did this because

19:29.418 --> 19:30.502
you guys put me through
the ringer tonight.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.920
- Yeah? Well, you were a jerk
to Bella at Homecoming

19:32.004 --> 19:34.965
and never even apologized.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.092
- Look, I was acting
like an idiot last year.

19:37.175 --> 19:40.262
But I've apologized a hundred
times since then.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.638
Don't you ever
read my emails?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.766
- Well...no.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.437
As soon as you stood me up,
I blocked your email address.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.606
I may have also
blocked your number.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.774
And I may have also written
some nasty things about you

19:52.858 --> 19:55.903
on the wall in
the girls' bathroom.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.029
- Okay, didn't you
at least open

19:57.112 --> 19:59.823
the first pizza
I delivered tonight?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.450
- Sorry, I...I threw
that away.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.619
- Like a monster.
- Aren't you full yet?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.203
- I like to eat. Sue me.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.757
- "I'm so so sorry." Aw.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.300
That must have
taken some work.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.719
- As far as apologies go,
it's pretty "cheesy."

20:20.802 --> 20:22.179
[laughing]

20:22.262 --> 20:25.766
Continue talking.
- I thought it was great.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.686
- Look, Bella,
I knew this was your house.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.646
And I've been leaving
menus here all summer

20:30.729 --> 20:32.814
on the chance that
you'd call and order--

20:32.898 --> 20:34.650
and you finally did.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.276
- And I spent the whole
night terrorizing you.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.195
- And I took it because
I was so wrong

20:38.278 --> 20:42.157
for what I did at
Homecoming--totally wrong.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.744
I wanted to make sure you
knew how sorry I was.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.913
- That's so sweet.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.748
- Can we be friends?

20:49.831 --> 20:53.835
- No, absolutely not.
- What?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.713
- Gotcha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

20:56.797 --> 20:58.298
Of course, we can
be friends.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.132
- Awesome.
Well, hey, I've gotta go.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.134
My buddy Lavelle
took my deliveries

21:01.218 --> 21:02.344
and I think your neighbors

21:02.427 --> 21:04.262
actually placed an order
this time, so...

21:04.346 --> 21:05.430
- [dog barking]
- LAVELLE: [screaming]

21:05.514 --> 21:08.433
- Oh, gosh. Just throw
him the pizza, Lavelle!

21:08.517 --> 21:10.310
It's not worth it!
- [loud thud]

21:10.394 --> 21:12.688
- Oh, no, he tripped.
- LAVELLE: Zaaaaach!

21:12.771 --> 21:13.897
- Bye, Zach.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.024
- OMG! That was so sweet!

21:16.108 --> 21:18.860
- [dreamily]
I know...

21:18.944 --> 21:20.529
- We should call
Animal Control.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.322
- I know.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.830
- Spaghetti?
- Oh, arm...armpit?

21:29.913 --> 21:31.623
- Jennifer Lawrence?

21:31.707 --> 21:34.209
- Jennifer Lawrence's
armpit? Bam!

21:34.292 --> 21:36.336
- Really? No. Look, it's...

21:36.420 --> 21:39.047
- TROY: Guys,
it's a hurricane, duh.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.632
- Thank you!

21:40.716 --> 21:41.383
See? Troy gets me.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.385
- Dang it.
- Come on, man.

21:43.468 --> 21:47.222
- TROY: Six for six.
I am the king of game night.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.016
Salute your king, peasants.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.934
Pay tribute to
your lord and master.

21:51.018 --> 21:51.727
Show the Troy some lov--

21:51.810 --> 21:54.062
- ALL: [laughing]

21:54.146 --> 21:55.439
- I'm sure gonna
miss that guy.
