00:43.200 --> 00:48.040
Much of our planet
still remains unexplored...

00:50.720 --> 00:53.960
..for most of it is covered
by water.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.440
Every journey below the surface
can reveal something extraordinary.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.560
More than a thousand new species
are discovered here every year.

01:24.760 --> 01:32.760
The ocean is home to 80%
of all animal life on Planet Earth.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.680
But today,
thriving in this varied world

01:45.680 --> 01:50.520
sometimes demands
the most surprising behaviour.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.960
The shallow seas of the tropics.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.120
This may look like a paradise...

02:24.120 --> 02:28.560
..but beneath the surface,
it is an arena

02:28.560 --> 02:31.960
for constant
life-and-death struggles,

02:31.960 --> 02:35.520
where not everything
is quite as it seems.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.680
A predatory lionfish...

02:51.440 --> 02:54.760
..on the hunt for shrimp
and small fish.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.920
With so many places
for its prey to hide,

03:07.920 --> 03:10.920
the lionfish has to be patient.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.080
This shrimp appears tempting.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.160
As the lion-fish closes in,

03:25.160 --> 03:30.000
it fans out its fins
to disorientate its prey.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.560
The hunter becomes the hunted.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.560
Tricked by one
of the shallow sea's

03:54.560 --> 03:57.120
most extraordinary predators...

04:01.120 --> 04:03.880
..a clown frogfish!

04:06.400 --> 04:10.000
On its head, it carries
a fishing rod –

04:10.000 --> 04:12.320
a modified dorsal fin,

04:12.320 --> 04:17.240
baited with a lure -
easily mistaken for a shrimp.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.400
But, when the fish stop biting,

04:30.400 --> 04:33.000
it's time to pack the rod away

04:33.000 --> 04:35.280
and move on.

04:38.280 --> 04:43.920
And, for a frogfish,
that takes time.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.080
Rather than swim, frogfish walk!

05:01.000 --> 05:04.760
Its fins have, in effect,
become feet.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.360
It may not look pretty,

05:16.360 --> 05:23.000
but what appears to be coral living
on its skin is actually camouflage.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.320
As every good angler knows,

05:39.320 --> 05:42.440
picking the right spot is important.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.280
Jigging the rod sends out
pressure waves

05:51.280 --> 05:54.520
to attract the attention
of possible prey.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.840
These dragonets
are certainly interested.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.880
Almost there.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.640
Hook, line, and sinker.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.880
Like all shallow seas,
the cold waters

06:52.880 --> 06:55.840
off the coast of North America,

06:55.840 --> 06:59.560
benefit from the intensity
of the sunshine.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.640
Here, that fuels

07:08.640 --> 07:12.160
one of the fastest-growing
organisms on the planet...

07:14.160 --> 07:16.120
..giant kelp.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.640
Towering forests
can eventually reach the height

07:22.640 --> 07:25.080
of a 12-storey building.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.040
These forests are nurseries
for young horn sharks.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.720
As the sun begins to set,

07:48.720 --> 07:51.840
they leave their daytime shelter

07:51.840 --> 07:57.440
and set off into the heart
of the kelp forest to find food.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.640
Barely half a metre long,

08:09.640 --> 08:13.440
this little shark
is extremely vulnerable.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.280
There are monsters here.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.080
A giant sea bass –

08:26.080 --> 08:29.040
weighing over 200kg...

08:32.280 --> 08:35.880
..and wolf-eels, with big teeth

08:35.880 --> 08:39.200
that can crush
little red sea urchins.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.200
But the biggest danger
comes from other sharks -

08:49.400 --> 08:52.560
houndsharks...

08:56.160 --> 08:59.880
..and huge broadnose sevengills.

09:11.520 --> 09:16.120
In this forest,
it pays to keep a low profile.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.040
An angel shark...

09:55.400 --> 09:59.440
..one of the most deadly sharks
in the kelp forest,

09:59.440 --> 10:03.040
and certainly
the best camouflaged.

10:13.640 --> 10:18.520
An angel shark
will lie in wait for days...

10:27.960 --> 10:33.800
..but this one has already attracted
too much attention.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.040
It's not welcome here.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.400
Now, the coast is clear.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.080
But angel sharks hunt
around the clock.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.080
Openings for breathing,
called spiracles,

11:18.080 --> 11:21.400
blow out sand
that helps cover its body.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.480
The trap is set.

11:42.920 --> 11:49.040
Staying close to the seabed is
a good way to avoid most predators.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.000
Faster than the blink of an eye.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.840
But it's not over yet.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.880
Horn sharks have a secret weapon.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.880
Sharp spikes keep them very much
off the menu for most.

13:19.400 --> 13:25.200
So, this young horn shark
can hunt in safety...

13:27.160 --> 13:29.160
..for now.

13:55.760 --> 14:00.720
Violent winter storms
batter these kelp forests.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.160
The plants can be ripped
from the seafloor...

14:14.120 --> 14:17.720
..and carried away far out to sea.

14:29.680 --> 14:34.960
The open ocean
is a vast, featureless desert.

14:38.840 --> 14:43.560
Even a small piece of drifting kelp
can become valuable.

14:53.520 --> 14:58.520
It's just what these fish
have been searching for.

15:00.280 --> 15:05.400
Here, shelter where eggs can be laid
unobtrusively is rare...

15:07.200 --> 15:09.960
..so they make the most of it.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.120
Each female produces
up to a thousand eggs,

15:16.120 --> 15:19.440
and the males rush in
to fertilise them.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.360
All this activity attracts
the attention of blue sharks.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.920
They can travel thousands of miles

15:40.920 --> 15:43.560
through the ocean
in search of food...

15:47.960 --> 15:52.920
..and they may not have eaten
for weeks.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.680
It seems that they're in luck.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.600
But these fish are no easy meal.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.040
They are flying fish!

17:15.120 --> 17:17.920
The blue shark, however,

17:17.920 --> 17:20.040
are not here for the fish...

17:23.040 --> 17:27.160
..they have come for the caviar.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.720
But flying fish lay so many eggs,

17:44.720 --> 17:48.160
that the sharks' feasts
hardly make an impact.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.960
And, in a few months' time, a new
generation will take to the skies.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.040
Floating islands of weed
are always attractive to creatures

18:20.040 --> 18:23.520
looking for shelter
out in the big blue.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.600
But, in today's ocean, they are
being replaced by something else...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.800
..plastic.

18:38.800 --> 18:43.440
12 million tons of it
end up in the ocean every year.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.360
The deadliest kind are discarded
fishing lines and nets.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.800
Each year, it's likely over
half a million animals are ensnared

19:00.800 --> 19:04.480
and killed by these "ghost nets."

19:14.040 --> 19:16.400
But some animals are learning

19:16.400 --> 19:19.520
how to take advantage
of the plastic rafts...

19:22.320 --> 19:26.920
..and use them for shelter,
or even as a home.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.960
This male Columbus crab – barely
bigger than your thumb nail –

19:34.960 --> 19:37.360
is a castaway.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.040
Clinging to his net,

19:42.040 --> 19:46.080
he may have been drifting
on ocean currents for months.

19:49.040 --> 19:53.040
Now, fully grown,
he needs to find a partner.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.600
But where?

20:05.160 --> 20:07.640
Certainly not here,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.400
alone on the net.

20:19.160 --> 20:24.520
Columbus crabs are not good
swimmers, so this male is marooned.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.920
Perhaps a passing loggerhead turtle
could be the chance

20:37.920 --> 20:39.640
to hitch a lift.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.160
Made it!

21:35.040 --> 21:39.360
But there's more than one
passenger here -

21:39.360 --> 21:42.360
a female Columbus crab!

21:50.120 --> 21:53.760
They waste no time
in getting acquainted...

21:57.160 --> 21:59.560
..and start to mate.

22:07.280 --> 22:12.040
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

22:21.880 --> 22:26.560
A turtle, after all,
makes an excellent home.

22:34.840 --> 22:40.000
In return, the crabs provide
an onboard grooming service.

23:10.840 --> 23:16.240
Finding a partner in the vast ocean
is not easy.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.720
Dawn in the Sea of Cortez...

23:50.160 --> 23:52.640
..Mobula rays.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.640
They're gathering here,
most likely to breed.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.560
No-one is sure why they leap,

24:24.560 --> 24:29.160
but the loud splashes
certainly seem to attract more rays.

24:33.320 --> 24:37.600
Other creatures, however,
are also listening.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.360
Orca have heard the splashes.

25:12.840 --> 25:17.200
This female specialises
in hunting rays.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.240
But today, she is teaching
two youngsters

25:28.240 --> 25:32.560
the finer points
of Mobula ray hunting.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.680
The rays are fast
and can outmanoeuvre an orca.

25:56.880 --> 26:01.720
She knows she needs to herd
the prey into a tight group...

26:06.680 --> 26:10.200
..but she can't do that on her own.

26:10.200 --> 26:14.160
It will take teamwork,

26:14.160 --> 26:16.840
and that is today's lesson.

26:24.160 --> 26:28.200
The young orca
are quick to catch on.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.040
The rays are surrounded.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.160
They dive...

26:45.000 --> 26:50.200
..only to be forced back up again
by the experienced female.

26:53.880 --> 26:59.280
And now, with the exhausted rays
trapped against the surface,

26:59.280 --> 27:01.600
she attacks...

27:14.640 --> 27:18.560
..and the young ones
follow her lead.

27:27.600 --> 27:32.360
This family are the only orca
known to hunt rays like this...

27:33.960 --> 27:36.920
..and they are lethally efficient.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.200
But it appears that school
is over for today.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.880
For a few battle-scarred survivors,

27:50.880 --> 27:53.360
it's a lucky reprieve.

28:03.880 --> 28:08.800
With the orca gone, the rays
can resume their courtship...

28:17.040 --> 28:20.960
..and they do so
in astounding numbers.

28:30.120 --> 28:34.320
Tens of thousands of rays
in a single shoal.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.640
Vast areas of our ocean
are yet to be explored.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.960
The least known parts of it
are its great depths.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.800
Only highly-specialised vessels
can take you there.

29:16.080 --> 29:20.520
As you descend,
the sunlight rapidly fades.

29:26.840 --> 29:31.600
200m down,
you enter the twilight zone...

29:38.800 --> 29:45.040
..an alien world, inhabited
by creatures beyond imagination.

30:06.720 --> 30:12.680
A siphonophore – with a cloak
of lethal stinging tentacles.

30:25.760 --> 30:29.840
Siphonophores repeatedly
clone themselves

30:29.840 --> 30:32.920
and so grow to immense lengths.

30:37.440 --> 30:43.320
This one measures 45m and is
the longest animal ever recorded.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.320
With such deadly predators around,

30:50.320 --> 30:54.080
creatures here go
to great lengths to hide.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.120
A glass squid...

31:08.840 --> 31:11.640
..completely transparent,

31:11.640 --> 31:14.200
except for its eyes...

31:17.720 --> 31:21.000
..and stomach,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.920
so it is extremely difficult
to find in the gloom.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.920
Below 1,000m,

31:48.920 --> 31:52.680
all traces of sunlight
have disappeared.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.480
This is the midnight zone.

32:03.680 --> 32:08.320
Catching food in the perpetual
darkness is not easy.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.640
A gulper eel.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.920
Its giant, extendable mouth

32:41.920 --> 32:45.400
can engulf prey
larger than its own body.

33:08.880 --> 33:14.000
Two miles down,
you finally reach the ocean floor.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.080
We know more
about the surface of Mars.

33:28.480 --> 33:34.600
The pressure of the water is 300
times greater than at the surface...

33:34.600 --> 33:37.040
..and it's freezing cold.

33:39.360 --> 33:44.360
Yet, amazingly,
there are animals living here.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.640
Muusoctopus robustus,

33:52.640 --> 33:55.920
nicknamed the pearl octopus.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.560
Breeding, in these
extreme conditions poses

34:02.560 --> 34:05.600
a particular problem
for these animals.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.000
At these low temperatures,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.640
this female's eggs could take
over ten years to develop.

34:24.760 --> 34:29.040
So she travels
to a very special place.

34:43.200 --> 34:48.600
This is the largest known
gathering of octopus in the world.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.520
She joins 20,000 other females...

35:04.440 --> 35:07.320
..all here to lay their eggs.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.400
Water, heated deep
in the Earth's crust,

35:17.400 --> 35:20.680
rises through cracks
in the seabed...

35:22.560 --> 35:27.840
..raising the temperature
to as much as 10 degrees Celsius.

35:29.240 --> 35:32.080
A deep-sea thermal spa!

35:37.080 --> 35:40.120
This warmth significantly speeds up

35:40.120 --> 35:43.280
the development of their eggs.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.400
Even so, they will still take
nearly two years to hatch.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.040
Once a female is settled,

35:52.040 --> 35:54.600
she won't move from her spot...

35:56.080 --> 35:58.600
..not even to feed.

36:10.120 --> 36:14.200
She will constantly tend
to her brood –

36:14.200 --> 36:17.120
keeping them clean,

36:17.120 --> 36:19.200
and oxygenating them

36:19.200 --> 36:21.840
with jets of water.

36:25.480 --> 36:30.600
Pearl octopus mothers must surely be
amongst the most devoted.

36:47.880 --> 36:53.360
After almost two years,
the ordeal take its toll.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.120
But the vigil is almost over.

38:01.920 --> 38:06.280
The last of the brood
are gently encouraged to leave.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.240
But this will be a final act.

38:19.080 --> 38:25.360
Like all the mothers here, this
octopus is starved and exhausted.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.480
Her life will soon be over.

38:49.520 --> 38:53.160
But this devotion means
that her offspring are among

38:53.160 --> 38:58.040
the largest and most developed
of any octopus

38:58.040 --> 39:00.720
and have the best chance of survival

39:00.720 --> 39:03.560
in the demanding world of the deep.

39:19.920 --> 39:24.280
We're finding more of these
strange hot springs every year.

39:35.160 --> 39:39.120
In some places,
they can be astonishingly violent.

39:40.560 --> 39:45.360
Super-heated water –
hot enough to melt lead -

39:45.360 --> 39:47.960
spouts from the seafloor.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.960
Dissolved minerals
condense around them

39:51.960 --> 39:57.040
to form towering chimneys,
known as hydrothermal vents.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.240
They are home to unique
communities of animals

40:05.240 --> 40:09.080
that all rely on the nutrients
in the scalding water.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.880
Some suggest that vents
like these could be the places

40:22.880 --> 40:27.080
where life on Earth first began
four billion years ago.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.200
And there is now evidence
of hydrothermal vents

40:38.200 --> 40:41.280
on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.960
Could they too be supporting life?

40:50.600 --> 40:54.920
Here on Earth,
the influence of these vents

40:54.920 --> 40:57.880
extends far beyond their chimneys.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.880
The essential nutrients
carried in these plumes

41:02.880 --> 41:07.800
can rise all the way to the surface
two miles above.

41:13.320 --> 41:18.160
Here, they stimulate the rapid
growth of tiny marine plants...

41:18.160 --> 41:20.880
..on an astronomic scale.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.040
This phytoplankton is so abundant

41:31.040 --> 41:35.320
that it produces half
of all the oxygen on Earth.

41:53.400 --> 41:58.000
It's also food for a host
of minute animals -

41:59.480 --> 42:01.800
zooplankton.

42:03.560 --> 42:07.280
Together, they are the basis
of the food chains

42:07.280 --> 42:10.360
that sustain
nearly all life in the ocean.

42:16.040 --> 42:19.520
In the Pacific waters
off South America,

42:19.520 --> 42:24.480
they feed anchovy
that gather here in billions.

42:37.760 --> 42:42.120
This is one of the world's
most productive ecosystems.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.440
These South American
sea lions are on the hunt.

43:17.760 --> 43:22.680
But the anchovy shoal
has already been located...

43:27.280 --> 43:30.680
..by the planet's
most efficient hunters.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.800
A net, over half a mile long,

43:36.800 --> 43:38.760
encircles the shoal.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.800
It can trap over a million fish.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.600
But the sea lions
aren't about to go hungry.

44:01.920 --> 44:05.520
They have learnt
to look for holes in the net.

44:16.040 --> 44:22.640
Why waste energy when food
comes to you as easily as this?!

44:29.320 --> 44:32.600
As more and more sea lions arrive,

44:32.600 --> 44:35.120
some change their tactics.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.720
They line up
on both sides of the net...

44:47.360 --> 44:49.200
..and wait.

45:03.960 --> 45:08.840
As the net tightens, the anchovy
panic and rush for the surface.

45:15.240 --> 45:19.360
This is the moment the sea lions
have been waiting for.

45:33.640 --> 45:37.400
It's such an effective way
of hunting that the sea lions here

45:37.400 --> 45:40.240
are changing
their natural behaviour...

45:43.400 --> 45:47.200
..and are raiding the fishing nets

45:47.200 --> 45:49.640
in their thousands.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.560
With the net almost drawn in,

45:59.560 --> 46:02.800
the fishermen beat out
a warning signal.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.280
Time is up.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.800
In the confusion,
not everyone manages to escape.

46:50.400 --> 46:54.920
The trapped sea lions are in danger
of being drowned.

47:16.600 --> 47:20.360
Pups are separated
from their mothers.

48:24.120 --> 48:28.840
Then, at the last minute, the
fishermen briefly drop their net...

48:36.240 --> 48:39.360
..and the trapped sea lions
can escape.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.880
But many are not so lucky.

48:52.760 --> 48:57.800
Around the world, millions
of animals are accidently caught

48:57.800 --> 49:01.880
and die in fishing nets every day.

49:04.280 --> 49:08.080
And this by-catch, as it's known,

49:08.080 --> 49:11.480
is pushing many species
toward extinction.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.720
Animals have evolved
in remarkable ways

49:19.720 --> 49:22.360
to the demands of life in the ocean.

49:27.040 --> 49:30.080
But can they now adapt
to the new challenge -

49:31.320 --> 49:33.840
living alongside us?

49:51.040 --> 49:54.160
The open ocean is home
to some of the largest

49:54.160 --> 49:56.880
and most extraordinary animals
on Earth.

49:59.320 --> 50:01.560
But here, off the Canary Islands,

50:01.560 --> 50:05.160
the Planet Earth team are searching
for one of its smaller,

50:05.160 --> 50:07.800
and less familiar residents.

50:07.800 --> 50:10.360
We're looking for a tiny creature
called a Columbus crab,

50:10.360 --> 50:12.520
which is only about the size
of your thumbnail,

50:12.520 --> 50:16.200
which live on floating objects
in the open ocean.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.520
Columbus crabs were once
only found on natural debris,

50:19.520 --> 50:21.600
like driftwood or seaweed,

50:21.600 --> 50:23.640
but the oceans are changing,

50:23.640 --> 50:25.840
and they've been forced to adapt.

50:40.240 --> 50:44.640
One of the most common items
they find is discarded fishing gear.

50:46.960 --> 50:52.240
Over a million tons is left adrift
in the ocean each year.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.600
And Columbus crabs are now
making their homes

50:56.600 --> 50:59.120
on these unnatural materials.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.920
Surprisingly, Columbus crabs
are thriving on this new habitat.

51:15.200 --> 51:20.080
But, for larger ocean creatures,
these nets can be lethal.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.760
Loggerhead sea turtles
are especially vulnerable.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.800
Many times, they are very injured

51:32.800 --> 51:36.680
and many times
they don't even survive.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.200
It's a sad situation.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.640
As a rule, wildlife film-makers
observe natural behaviour

51:44.640 --> 51:46.720
and do not interfere.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.680
But this is far from natural.

51:53.680 --> 51:57.120
The team feel they must take action.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.480
Sh...

52:09.480 --> 52:11.840
It seems that the turtle
is quite OK.

52:11.840 --> 52:16.480
We'll just finish to cut
the plastic and then we release it.

52:32.920 --> 52:35.120
It's a bittersweet moment,

52:35.120 --> 52:40.360
as this is one of eight turtles
they rescued whilst filming here.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.680
This situation is not natural,

52:43.680 --> 52:47.440
it's something that is
being caused by human beings.

52:49.040 --> 52:52.480
Sadly, the crew now face
dilemmas like this

52:52.480 --> 52:55.800
on many of their
filming expeditions...

52:57.840 --> 53:01.960
..including, when they travelled
to the Pacific coast of Chile,

53:01.960 --> 53:04.920
to show how sea lions
are competing for food

53:04.920 --> 53:07.480
with one of the biggest fisheries
on Earth.

53:12.560 --> 53:17.320
Expedition leader Fernando Olivares
takes the team to the fleet.

53:24.520 --> 53:28.160
Diving near fishing nets
is extremely dangerous,

53:28.160 --> 53:31.720
so the crew must ensure they have
the full cooperation

53:31.720 --> 53:33.640
of the fishermen.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.120
Pretty hazardous place to dive.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.440
It's just a case of trying
to keep an eye on the divers,

54:03.440 --> 54:06.000
but the sea lions also like
to go down and blow bubbles,

54:06.000 --> 54:07.840
so you'll think
you're following the divers,

54:07.840 --> 54:10.160
and then a sea lion will pop up.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.880
Taking the utmost care,

54:17.880 --> 54:19.960
the divers get a close-up view

54:19.960 --> 54:22.520
of the sheer scale of the operation.

54:28.440 --> 54:32.000
This one net must have
about 15 tons of fish in it

54:32.000 --> 54:35.120
and there's eight or nine boats
in this one little bay,

54:35.120 --> 54:36.800
and these are just the small boats.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.880
Out there, there are huge
factory ships that are taking

54:38.880 --> 54:41.040
even bigger catches.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.640
How much fish a year from just here?

54:44.640 --> 54:48.480
From a million tons a year
more or less.

54:56.520 --> 54:59.160
The catches are so vast,

54:59.160 --> 55:02.280
the sea lions have changed
their natural behaviour

55:02.280 --> 55:05.600
to collect anchovies
directly from the nets.

55:09.760 --> 55:11.800
But it's a risky strategy.

55:13.360 --> 55:17.320
The crew witnessed sea lions
caught in nets multiple times.

55:18.360 --> 55:21.520
Whoa, it's intense mate,
there are so many in there.

55:27.720 --> 55:30.320
There's a pup stuck in the net,
calling to its mother,

55:30.320 --> 55:33.360
and its mother's just on the outside
of the net calling back.

55:39.640 --> 55:42.240
That's really hard to watch.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.040
Oh, the pup's really panicking now.

55:52.520 --> 55:57.040
Sometimes, fishermen are able
to release trapped sea lions...

55:58.360 --> 56:00.520
..but not this time.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.160
The pup is in serious danger.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.960
Once again,
the crew decide to step in.

56:12.840 --> 56:16.080
Hey, he's going to go
inside of the net to save him.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.040
Wow.

56:45.880 --> 56:49.800
Nice, really nice.

56:49.800 --> 56:51.880
It's a relief this time...

56:54.400 --> 56:59.880
..but it highlights the new
realities of filming wildlife

56:59.880 --> 57:03.520
in today's changing ocean.

57:12.560 --> 57:16.880
Next time, a journey to Earth's
greatest wilderness -

57:20.600 --> 57:24.200
deserts and grasslands...

57:29.720 --> 57:33.160
..where nature puts on
its most dramatic show.

57:36.040 --> 57:40.160
