00:00.100 --> 00:04.590
Otter gone wild 

00:10.378 --> 00:13.540
- Steady, men. Steady. 

00:14.784 --> 00:16.586
On my mark... 

00:17.097 --> 00:17.705
Go. 

00:30.881 --> 00:32.375
And time. 

00:32.958 --> 00:34.397
- Well done, boys. 

00:34.477 --> 00:36.623
A new record. Which means... 

00:36.703 --> 00:38.898
- Say it, say it, say it... 

00:39.316 --> 00:41.839
- Sno-cones! - Oh, yes. 

00:47.454 --> 00:48.877
- Hey, guys. What's doing? 

00:48.957 --> 00:51.494
- We're going for yummy sno-cones. Wanna come? 

00:51.574 --> 00:55.457
Oh, yes. Sno-cones? Sno-cones are the best. 

00:55.537 --> 00:58.025
And real quick, a sno-cone is... 

00:58.105 --> 01:01.656
- 70.2% shaved ice, 15.6% flavored syrup, 

01:01.736 --> 01:06.930
14.2% paper, of which 8.7% is recycled. 

01:07.010 --> 01:09.527
Um, okay. Sounds good. Let's go. 

01:09.607 --> 01:10.668
Excellante. 

01:10.748 --> 01:14.336
Our intel has pinpointed a stand just west of the museum. 

01:14.416 --> 01:17.508
- Museum? Since when is there a museum in the zoo? 

01:17.588 --> 01:20.906
- Since-- and this is only an estimate, of course-- 

01:20.986 --> 01:21.873
Um, never. 

01:21.953 --> 01:23.967
- The sno-cone stand's in the park, Marlene. 

01:24.047 --> 01:27.364
- The park? I mean-- You mean-- You mean the park-park? 

01:27.444 --> 01:29.151
Outside the zoo walls? 

01:29.231 --> 01:30.856
- That's the one. Can't miss it. 

01:31.003 --> 01:34.919
- We-- oh, I just remembered. I got to clean my habitat 

01:34.999 --> 01:38.208
and, um, you know, a whole lot of other stuff-- Ton of stuff. 

01:38.288 --> 01:43.160
So I'm way too busy to go over the wall for sno-cones. 

01:43.240 --> 01:46.080
- Kowalski, baloney detector reading. 

01:51.626 --> 01:54.908
- Skipper, I'm detecting dangerous levels of baloney. 

01:54.988 --> 01:57.925
- Marlene, do I need to call you a phony baloney? 

01:58.005 --> 01:59.576
Okay, you guys are cute. 

01:59.656 --> 02:01.813
Listen, the truth is, I'm-- 

02:01.898 --> 02:04.087
I'm just, well, a little scared. 

02:04.346 --> 02:05.705
Of sno-cones? 

02:05.785 --> 02:07.536
- No. The outside. 

02:07.914 --> 02:09.503
I was born in... 

02:09.584 --> 02:13.081
Captivity; there, I said it, okay? I've never, ever set foot outside. 

02:13.161 --> 02:16.319
- Marlene, there's no reason to fear the outside world. 

02:16.464 --> 02:17.902
- Other than random street crime... 

02:17.982 --> 02:19.037
- And natural disasters... 

02:19.117 --> 02:20.138
- Industrial accidents... 

02:20.218 --> 02:21.075
Badger attacks. 

02:21.155 --> 02:22.390
- Are you two finished? 

02:23.075 --> 02:24.577
- Falling space debris. 

02:24.963 --> 02:26.517
Uh, all finished. 

02:26.754 --> 02:29.176
- The point is, marlene, we are city savvy. 

02:29.256 --> 02:32.288
- And we'll be with you the whole time. What could go wrong? 

02:32.368 --> 02:34.913
- Okay, you win. I'm in. 

02:35.787 --> 02:37.775
I recommend the rainbow cone. 

02:37.918 --> 02:41.053
You get to try every flavor, and it looks like a clown's head. 

02:41.133 --> 02:42.537
- Fabjulous! 

02:43.202 --> 02:45.997
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go. 

02:46.077 --> 02:48.925
- Where did he-- - Get the loads out, penguins. 

02:49.005 --> 02:50.741
The snowy cones might melt. 

03:10.377 --> 03:15.138
It's just so big and free and-- And outside. 

03:15.218 --> 03:17.837
- Outside, outside, outside. Who cares? 

03:18.036 --> 03:19.388
Where are the-- 

03:20.211 --> 03:23.122
Hey, where is the outside? Hello? 

03:23.202 --> 03:24.407
- We could leave him. 

03:24.487 --> 03:27.076
- Tempting, but it violates the penguin code. 

03:27.156 --> 03:28.046
- Oh, yeah. 

03:28.126 --> 03:29.235
- No walls... 

03:30.300 --> 03:31.723
No fences.

03:40.896 --> 03:42.906
- Put your back into it, men. 

03:49.867 --> 03:51.125
Nothing to hold me back. 

03:51.205 --> 03:54.195
I can- I can go wild. 

03:58.568 --> 03:59.712
Oh, hello. 

03:59.792 --> 04:01.008
Did you miss me? 

04:01.088 --> 04:02.448
- Not as much as you might think. 

04:02.528 --> 04:04.946
- Um, skipper, where's marlene? 

04:09.051 --> 04:10.124
- Anything? 

04:10.204 --> 04:11.778
- Negative. - Nothing. 

04:13.539 --> 04:16.772
- Blast. She's gone without a trace. 

04:21.369 --> 04:22.717
- Is that marlene? 

04:22.797 --> 04:25.168
- She doesn't look quite right. 

04:26.209 --> 04:27.811
- It is marlene. 

04:29.080 --> 04:30.782
- She's just...a little cranky. 

04:42.020 --> 04:44.974
- You've got this new vibe going on. 

04:45.054 --> 04:47.495
I like it. It's bol-- 

04:47.639 --> 04:50.350
Ah, help! I'm being king-napped! 

04:50.988 --> 04:53.684
- Somebody want to tell me what just happened? 

04:53.764 --> 04:55.196
- The answer is obvious: 

04:55.276 --> 04:57.398
marlene has fallen victim to... 

04:57.542 --> 05:00.247
The mind control satellites that circle our earth. 

05:00.327 --> 05:01.964
Protective head gear, everyone. 

05:02.391 --> 05:04.407
- Gee, I think she's just gone wild. 

05:04.487 --> 05:06.802
- Right. I'm declaring level-red emergency. 

05:06.882 --> 05:08.080
Search and rescue, men. 

05:08.160 --> 05:09.169
- Um, skipper? 

05:09.249 --> 05:11.149
Does this mean we're not getting sno-cones? 

05:11.229 --> 05:14.503
- Private, how could you even ask that at a time like this? 

05:15.690 --> 05:19.122
- Oh, we start here, sweep this way, and circle around. 

05:19.279 --> 05:20.280
Any questions? 

05:22.015 --> 05:23.381
- Okay, marlene. 

05:23.736 --> 05:26.547
I suppose you'll be demanding some ransoms. 

05:26.760 --> 05:30.114
Now, I am worth very much, so you must ask for top-- 

05:32.636 --> 05:38.479
- Why are you eyeing my delicious flanks and my robust rump? 

05:38.894 --> 05:42.559
Wait. You are not going to ransom me. 

05:42.639 --> 05:45.584
You are... Going to eat me! 

05:46.624 --> 05:48.383
Eat me if you must. 

05:48.463 --> 05:50.757
But I will give you terrible indigestion, 

05:50.837 --> 05:54.299
a gas unlike... any ever! 

05:54.583 --> 05:55.949
Marlene? 

05:57.118 --> 05:58.584
- Eh, that is not eating. 

05:59.176 --> 06:01.332
Oh, my. No, please. 

06:01.412 --> 06:04.127
You must stop. I am royal. 

06:04.207 --> 06:07.525
- It isn't right for a commoner such as yourself to- 

06:08.999 --> 06:11.565
Well, maybe just a minute more. 

06:11.645 --> 06:13.118
No! Marlene! 

06:13.905 --> 06:16.551
How would I be explaining this to my mother? 

06:18.154 --> 06:21.222
You're right. Her problem, not ours. 

06:21.302 --> 06:25.112
Just maybe... Not so tight. 

06:27.939 --> 06:29.140
- You, there. 

06:30.291 --> 06:32.207
Have you seen this lemur and otter? 

06:32.696 --> 06:35.285
- Which one of them is the otter? 

06:36.044 --> 06:38.382
- This one, obviously. Note the whiskers? 

06:38.462 --> 06:40.081
- No, I thought that was a cat. 

06:40.161 --> 06:42.512
- Did I say, "have you seen this lemurandcat?" 

06:42.592 --> 06:45.624
No; that's why I thought it was strange that you drew a cat. 

06:45.704 --> 06:46.782
- It's not a cat. 

06:46.931 --> 06:48.704
- Then why does it have whiskers? 

06:49.279 --> 06:50.816
- You know what? Never mind the otter. 

06:50.896 --> 06:52.462
- Cat. - Whatever! 

06:52.542 --> 06:53.515
Have you seen the lemur? 

06:53.595 --> 06:54.535
- What's a lemur? 

06:54.695 --> 06:56.523
- I think we're done here. 

06:57.793 --> 06:58.816
- Any luck? 

06:58.970 --> 07:00.515
- No. - Negatory. 

07:00.664 --> 07:02.716
- This is getting us nowhere fast. 

07:02.863 --> 07:03.930
We need a new tack. 

07:04.989 --> 07:06.062
- Ringtail. 

07:08.744 --> 07:10.561
- Ringtail. Marlene! 

07:10.764 --> 07:12.616
What are you doing? 

07:13.051 --> 07:15.954
- Skipper, I'm not comfortable watching this. 

07:17.089 --> 07:20.013
- Marlene is in love with me, 

07:20.093 --> 07:22.387
which makes perfect sense, really. I am a catch. 

07:22.467 --> 07:25.206
But why does this have to happen when she is snarly and gross? 

07:31.625 --> 07:35.189
Where are you taking me? 

07:40.596 --> 07:44.066
- Help me before I am squeezed and hugged 

07:44.146 --> 07:46.248
and doodle-doed into pulpiness! 

07:47.192 --> 07:50.046
- Kowalski, tell me you packed the climbing gear. 

07:50.126 --> 07:52.597
- Sorry, skipper. No room with all the trail mix. 

07:56.006 --> 07:58.295
- How are we going to get up that tower? 

07:58.375 --> 08:00.610
- Skipper? What about those? 

08:02.791 --> 08:04.314
- Good headwind today, huh? 

08:13.198 --> 08:15.208
Oh, hey, look, I can see my throne. 

08:27.783 --> 08:29.307
Please, no pushing. 

08:41.068 --> 08:43.807
- Two of my top four pilots. 

08:58.814 --> 09:00.538
- Help! 

09:00.618 --> 09:04.207
- It all comes down to me... Again. 

09:13.787 --> 09:15.804
Help! 

09:21.788 --> 09:23.125
Bottoms up! 

09:29.471 --> 09:32.059
Uh, where did that cage come from? 

09:32.139 --> 09:33.884
Sorry, that's classified information. 

09:36.843 --> 09:38.602
Top marks, boys. 

09:38.682 --> 09:41.121
- Does this mean... - You know it does. 

09:46.236 --> 09:48.017
- Will she ever be the same? 

09:48.123 --> 09:51.026
Possibly. But it may take months, perhaps years 

09:51.106 --> 09:53.129
to restore her back to her normal self. 

09:53.209 --> 09:55.193
- Um, guys? Why am I in a cage? 

09:55.330 --> 09:57.490
Or...maybe we just need to bring her home. 

09:57.570 --> 09:59.532
- Marlene? Are you okay? 

09:59.620 --> 10:01.930
- I'm in a cage, so not okay. 

10:02.010 --> 10:04.945
- You don't rember anything that happened outside the zoo? 

10:05.025 --> 10:08.329
- No. - Skipper, there's a scientific term for this, 

10:08.751 --> 10:10.102
weird. 

10:12.423 --> 10:15.053
What's up? Hey, hey! 

10:15.133 --> 10:17.541
- Oh, knock it off, you knuckleheads. 

10:19.580 --> 10:22.655
- Eh, now that you are much less growlily, 

10:22.735 --> 10:25.229
I accept your invitation of courtship. 

10:25.309 --> 10:27.022
- Wait. What? 

10:27.102 --> 10:30.502
- You don't remember being hopelessly in love with me? 

10:30.582 --> 10:31.921
- Ew, ew. 

10:32.001 --> 10:34.380
- You know what I say? I say you do remember, 

10:34.460 --> 10:36.264
and you are just trying to play it off. 

10:36.445 --> 10:37.825
That's what you are doing. 

10:37.905 --> 10:41.673
You are trying to play it off and to lift yourself higher. 

10:41.753 --> 10:42.865
It is not working. 

10:42.945 --> 10:44.753
Look, everybody is looking at you. 

10:45.166 --> 10:48.413
The female of the species, any species, 

10:48.493 --> 10:51.365
who is understanding them? Excuse me. 

10:53.702 --> 10:55.311
- I hear you, brother. 

10:55.732 --> 10:57.678
- Um, guys? Hello? 

10:57.758 --> 11:00.538
I thought we were getting sno-cones? Guys?
