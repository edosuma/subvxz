WEBVTT

00:14.764 --> 00:15.765
-Why am I naked?
-Oh, no.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.102
Go!

00:19.185 --> 00:20.562
I'll see you in Hell.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.776
What the hell?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.238
Where am I?

00:33.616 --> 00:34.451
Babe?

00:37.370 --> 00:38.455
What's wrong?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.041
Oh, Gabby.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.293
I just had the worst nightmare.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.004
I was with this old man, and he...

00:47.047 --> 00:48.757
He frickin' blew up in front of me.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.592
And the old man was Pete.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.386
It was just a dream.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.387
It was so real.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.806
The missing billionaire was there and...

00:57.432 --> 00:59.392
And there was this blonde.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.436
Not again.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.897
Again? What do you mean, "again"?

01:08.026 --> 01:10.361
Your name is Jack Morton.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.322
You go to Belgrave University.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.532
You have a scholarship.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.952
Your mom died in a car accident
when you were eight.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.039
Your grandfather recently died
of a stroke.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.584
You have never heard of
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose

01:24.667 --> 01:26.503
or the Knights of Saint Christopher,

01:27.337 --> 01:30.381
and you're so in love
with Gabrielle Dupres

01:30.465 --> 01:32.884
you are willing to wait until marriage.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.182
And you think all blonde girls
are stuck-up skanks.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.233
This isn't the first time
we've had issues

01:48.316 --> 01:50.401
with your use of <i>pulveris memoria,</i>
Miss Drake.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.861
Wasn't intentional.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.032
Oh, so you didn't want Mr. Morton
to wander around Norwich

01:56.116 --> 01:57.784
with complete amnesia for two days.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.538
Maybe promoting you to Magistratus
was a premature decision.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.583
I didn't want to modify his memories
in the first place.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.212
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were questioning my decisions.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.672
Of course not, Magus.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.966
<i>Grand </i>Magus.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.344
I only wonder if our response was
a little overzealous.

02:17.428 --> 02:21.349
Well, can't be a secret society
if outsiders know your secrets.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.727
The Knights of Saint Christopher
would've always been a threat to us

02:24.811 --> 02:26.271
as long as they knew we existed.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.273
Or they could be powerful allies.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.109
No, the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose
doesn't have allies.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.487
But they helped us defeat Edward Coventry.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.199
If you are looking for happily ever after,
you're in the wrong place.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.329
Comfort yourself with the knowledge
that Jack Morton is still alive.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.250
Sometimes that's the best
you can hope for.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.419
Now, what is it you wanted to show me?

02:50.378 --> 02:53.214
I think I figured out
how the Knights make their werewolves.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.717
Diego?

03:00.722 --> 03:01.973
Grand Magus.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.394
Thought you said you wanted to try out
a transformation spell.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.478
I do.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.772
The Knights possess a set of magic hides,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.442
each one imbued
with the spirit of a werewolf.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.194
You never said anything about werewolves.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.445
You didn't ask.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.197
Stand in front of the locker.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.623
Now what?

03:26.706 --> 03:27.540
We wait.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.756
Any day now, Miss Drake.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.008
The hide chooses the champion.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.344
So...

03:40.094 --> 03:43.723
your plan consists of, what,
marching every disciple in here

03:43.806 --> 03:46.017
to see if a fur coat
takes a fancy to them?

03:46.100 --> 03:48.519
You said you wanted a werewolf,
one you can control.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.648
I want a practitioner with
the magic strength of a werewolf.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.774
There's a difference.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.901
You're dismissed, Diego.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.861
Thank you, Grand Magus. Thank you.

04:01.074 --> 04:01.908
Stop.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.744
Wait. Come back.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.248
Do what she says.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.164
Jack Morton, you've been summoned.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.416
Will you accept the call?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.584
I promise to give my life...

04:54.294 --> 04:55.795
to cheer squad!

05:04.470 --> 05:07.974
<i>♪ When I was younger</i>
<i>I was insane for fame ♪</i>

05:54.145 --> 05:56.064
Come on, babe. I made first alternate.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.317
"First alternate" is just another term
for "best loser."

05:59.817 --> 06:00.693
I worked hard.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.279
Fixed your hair, fixed your clothes.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.366
Created you.
Should have made the team.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.077
Honestly, I don't really care
if I make cheer squad or not.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.080
You live for cheer squad.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.039
Do I?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.123
You will.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.750
-Whoa!
- Excuse you!

06:15.833 --> 06:17.710
-Check your route, dude.
-Yeah, okay, coach.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.920
Stick to the bench.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.755
You stick... I'll bench you.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.298
Carpio, let's go!

06:23.841 --> 06:26.052
You were over there so long,
I thought you were proposing.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.595
Yeah, he wishes.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.971
Hey, let's go to the gym.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.724
-Let's take a break.
-Let's go to the gym later.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.892
-Uh... Okay.
-Hey.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.770
Sorry I'm late.
I got tied up with something.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.438
Ooh, sounds kinky.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.273
It could be.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.193
-You don't give up, do you?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.152
I will...

06:44.153 --> 06:46.364
as soon as you tell me
you're not interested.

06:49.075 --> 06:49.951
You know,

06:50.368 --> 06:52.286
I'm not the good girl you think I am.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.249
How long have we known each other?
Two years?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.919
But how long have we
<i>really </i>known each other?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.880
Out of all the time that we spend
together, and that's going to be, what...

07:03.965 --> 07:05.591
two, three months?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.261
We've taken eight classes together.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.680
We are in the same study group.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.057
-We live in the same building.
-Exactly.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.601
We're practically strangers.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.563
Oh, undergrads. So naive.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.607
They actually think their education
will be used in the real world.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.026
Don't be cruel.
If they didn't want their useless degrees,

07:24.110 --> 07:25.903
we would never get
the teaching assistants jobs

07:25.987 --> 07:28.448
we need to pursue <i>our </i>useless degrees.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.783
My doctorate isn't useless.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.078
"Help! My wife has fallen.
Is there a metaphysician in the house?"

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
"Well, my son's choking.

07:37.915 --> 07:41.127
Oh, dear God, where is an epistemologist
when you need one?"

07:41.210 --> 07:42.670
Probably the nearest bar.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.713
It's noon somewhere.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.049
Would it have killed you
to smile more for the judges?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.677
But I was just busy
trying to be sharp and tight.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.430
You were sharp and tight,
but you also need to snap and shine.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.768
But you tried your hardest,
and that's all I care about.

07:57.852 --> 07:58.769
It is?

07:58.853 --> 08:03.191
Of course it is,
because you are my sweet Jack snack pack,

08:03.733 --> 08:05.026
and I love you.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.616
And I can't wait until we're married.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.660
-We don't have to wait for everything.
-Uh, yes, we do,

08:14.744 --> 08:18.414
because I made a vow
and I intend to keep that vow,

08:18.498 --> 08:19.790
and if I meant anything to you,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.584
you wouldn't put
that kind of pressure on me.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.337
Do you hear that ringing sound?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.715
I don't hear anything,
and don't interrupt me.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.301
As I was saying,
if I meant anything to you,

08:30.384 --> 08:31.928
you wouldn't put that kind of pressure--

08:33.888 --> 08:34.722
Jack?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.399
He's okay. He's hypoglycemic.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.153
First week of school.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.366
Your name is Jack Morton,
you go to Belgrave University,

08:53.449 --> 08:54.575
you have a scholarship.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.788
But you live for cheer squad.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.375
-Quality still needs to be up there.
-Oh, my God.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.919
Okay, so how long are we gonna be here?
'Cause I've got an exam.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.092
The <i>pulervis memoria</i>
isn't working anymore.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.261
I have to powder Morton
every few days now.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.138
You're right, it does seem to wear out
faster than before.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.598
Randall's had more relapses, too.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.102
In all honesty, the hardest part for me
is keeping pace with Hamish.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.770
That man can drink.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.188
Tell me about the transformation.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.982
Jack and I were walking
on the main concourse

09:26.065 --> 09:29.193
when Randall almost killed me because
his monitor can't keep him on his leash.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.028
You wanna swap? Say the word.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.114
The guy needs, like,
20 hours of exercise a day.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.865
Focus. The transformation.

09:34.949 --> 09:39.078
Jack said he heard a ringing noise,
and then he went all werewolf.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.246
Yeah.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.414
Same.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.166
Were any of you performing magic?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.669
What does that have to do with anything?

09:46.752 --> 09:49.505
We've performed magic all summer.
They've never transformed before now.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.591
Do I really need to remind you

09:51.674 --> 09:54.885
of the dangers of answering my questions
with a question?

09:57.179 --> 09:58.472
No, Grand Magus.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.891
No magic.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.691
So, what should we do?

10:10.526 --> 10:11.736
Go back to your charges.

10:12.653 --> 10:16.699
And as of now, no one is to perform magic
of any kind without my permission.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.703
So, I have to open the door...

10:21.954 --> 10:23.122
with my hand?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.376
What are you waiting for? Get the door.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.172
Oh, my God. Chivalry is dead.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.468
No magic.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.434
It's rather barbaric.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.911
Werewolves transformed.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.665
In broad daylight?

11:05.748 --> 11:06.832
Simultaneously.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.669
This endeavor has become
more trouble than it's worth.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.965
But this is the first time
that any of them have transformed.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.260
But it is not the first time we've had
issues with their memories resurfacing.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.637
Which is why I developed this.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.515
It's a more potent version
of <i>pulveris memoria.</i>

11:24.433 --> 11:25.351
Mm.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.021
And how long do you think it will take
for them to become immune to this?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.774
We can make them compliant.

11:32.024 --> 11:32.942
I know it.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.572
Unfortunately, I don't share
your sense of optimism.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.783
And if we cannot control them,

11:41.534 --> 11:43.160
we cannot induct them.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.371
-Then induct them first.
- You're not serious.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.416
Well, the Knights hear a ringing sound
when magic is performed,

11:48.499 --> 11:50.459
except when I helped them find Randall

11:50.543 --> 11:52.211
because we were working together.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.089
You want to control them
before we induct them,

11:55.172 --> 11:57.883
but maybe we have to induct them
to control them.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.888
I already have a reputation
for being too soft.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.349
Right.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.145
If I induct them now,
people will think I'm a bleeding heart.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.105
You wouldn't want them dead, either,

12:11.856 --> 12:16.444
because that would be the waste
of a potentially invaluable commodity.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.531
We'll try your new powder.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.743
The next time they're out of control

12:23.826 --> 12:25.244
will be the last.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.795
- I don't wanna practice anymore.
- Okay.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.255
Morning.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.841
All right. Settle down.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.552
- Take my picture. Get in here.

12:42.136 --> 12:46.724
This is your tutorial group
for ethics and politics.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.104
My name is Professor Cameron Foley.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.273
Uh... You can call me Professor Foley.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.192
Uh... Okay, housekeeping.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.404
Office hours are 3:00 to 3:45
every Thursday

13:00.488 --> 13:01.864
unless following a holiday,

13:01.947 --> 13:05.159
then it's the Tuesday preceding
the next scheduled lecture,

13:05.242 --> 13:07.787
provided that lecture doesn't fall
on an even-number day,

13:08.370 --> 13:12.583
in which case,
office hours are 4:00 to 4:45...

13:14.919 --> 13:16.295
on Wednesdays.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.798
There-- Oh, God. There's no, uh,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.633
extensions on assignments.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.177
Good morning. How was the sleep?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.261
And so...

13:25.846 --> 13:27.640
What was I talking about in the lecture?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.228
Seriously, folks.
I was on autopilot yesterday.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.231
You discussed the two branches
of political ethics,

13:35.314 --> 13:36.857
process and policy.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.901
Okay, sounds like something I'd do. Yeah.

13:39.735 --> 13:40.653
So who can define them?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.696
- You.
-Jack.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.614
Didn't ask.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.200
Um...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.327
Ethics of process is the idea

13:48.410 --> 13:52.289
that a leader or a party may have
to do wrong in order to achieve right,

13:52.373 --> 13:56.710
and ethics of policy
are the moral questions that arise

13:56.794 --> 13:59.088
from a leader of party's propositions,

13:59.421 --> 14:02.174
mainly around contentious issues
like healthcare,

14:02.258 --> 14:03.843
taxation, and the death penalty.

14:03.926 --> 14:04.760
Okay, great.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.887
Now we know you read the textbook.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.808
So what do you think?

14:10.891 --> 14:11.725
About what?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.813
Let's just stab at the deep end here,
okay?

14:16.063 --> 14:20.276
Should your government have the right
to assassinate an enemy leader?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.319
I guess that depends on the leader.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.362
Ouch.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.864
Hey, some leaders deserve it.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.282
Maybe by your standards,

14:26.365 --> 14:28.492
but maybe by their standards,

14:28.742 --> 14:29.952
that leader's awesome.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.664
Is there even such a thing
as good and evil, or...

14:34.915 --> 14:36.250
is it all just perception?

14:37.334 --> 14:40.045
Remember, when Truman dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima,

14:40.129 --> 14:41.463
we were all thrilled.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.882
USA! USA!

14:42.965 --> 14:43.966
Japanese, however...

14:44.049 --> 14:47.094
I doubt they were thinking,
"You know what? We had that coming."

14:50.931 --> 14:51.807
Do you hear that?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.226
The sound of someone
who loves their own voice? Sure do.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.769
No, it's a ringing sound.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.230
For the love of God, okay.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.524
<i> Las an dorchadas.</i>

15:07.197 --> 15:08.574
Someone call 911!

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
-<i> Quidquid requiritur.</i>

15:19.460 --> 15:20.878
Hurry up, let's go!

15:20.961 --> 15:22.212
-Don't look!
- Get help!

15:27.551 --> 15:29.970
Do you know why you're here?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.640
Because every time someone dies on campus
from magic,

15:32.723 --> 15:34.642
I'm the first person everyone blames.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.227
And it's not fair.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.396
I would say it was very fair,

15:39.480 --> 15:42.232
given your predilection
to settle your disputes with magic.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.985
I already told you,
I don't know what happened to Brandon.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.117
But I'm sure he got what he deserved.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.204
Yes, well...

15:57.581 --> 15:59.166
Thanks to this latest incident,

15:59.249 --> 16:04.338
I was compelled to perform yet another
<i>respondeo</i> incantation.

16:05.714 --> 16:10.177
<i>Respondeo</i> can be an effective
memory modifier, but it has a drawback.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.220
And that is?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.389
The longer you wait,
the weaker the impact.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.473
Yes.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.266
That's right.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.478
Time is of the essence, and today,

16:19.561 --> 16:23.232
I lost precious time to tracking
and tranquilizing four werewolves

16:23.649 --> 16:26.485
to prevent the spell from triggering
their transformation

16:26.568 --> 16:30.447
because magic makes werewolves angry.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.076
And you're only telling us that now?

16:38.205 --> 16:42.042
-Apologies, Grand Magus.
-Did you ignore my explicit orders

16:42.126 --> 16:43.127
and practice magic?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.754
No, Grand Magus.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.556
Send in the next disciple.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.941
Your turn. Have fun.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.987
Do you know why you're here?

17:10.946 --> 17:13.699
Because someone performed magic
without your permission.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.867
It's you.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.286
You're dismissed.
Send in the next disciple.

17:22.916 --> 17:26.295
Grand Magus,
maybe a magic tourist is responsible.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.131
Hm.

17:31.050 --> 17:31.967
Please.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.596
A fluff-bunny can't even use
tarot cards properly,

17:35.679 --> 17:39.183
let alone cast a successful murder spell.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.644
But it is possible that
a rogue practitioner killed that student.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.980
Sure. It's possible,

17:45.606 --> 17:46.982
but not probable.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.318
What's going to happen to the Knights?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.821
You know what has to happen.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.742
I also know the Knights are experts
at hunting down rogue practitioners.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.535
You want me to induct them.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.371
I can't induct them
if I can't control them.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.582
Uh... They're our enemies.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.292
But they don't know that.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.006
Let's say I was willing
to entertain your proposal.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.301
How would this work?

18:14.384 --> 18:16.678
Well, for starters,

18:17.346 --> 18:19.765
we'd have to invite them
without using any magic.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.228
<i>Since we spent the entire summer</i>

18:24.311 --> 18:26.688
<i>making them forget</i>
<i>that the Order even exists...</i>

18:28.440 --> 18:30.651
<i>we'll need to establish our mystique.</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:38.951
Is that a blue rose?

18:39.034 --> 18:41.203
Oh, my God, did the Hermetic Order
invite you to join?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.121
The Hermetic what?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.747
Like you don't know about the Order.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.625
They're like the Illuminati,
if the Illuminati existed.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.641
<i>But it shouldn't be too hard</i>
<i>to catch their attention...</i>

19:02.724 --> 19:05.477
"According to rumor,
a gender-neutral collective

19:05.561 --> 19:08.063
originally formed to protect
magic knowledge

19:08.147 --> 19:09.690
from religious oppression."

19:10.440 --> 19:12.860
...and pique their curiosity enough
to draw them out.

19:12.943 --> 19:16.655
"Kneebend Trail, midnight.
A new world awaits you."

19:31.128 --> 19:32.671
Is this the place for...

19:33.714 --> 19:34.590
this?

19:39.136 --> 19:42.973
Have any of you even ever
heard of this Blue Rose group before?

19:43.056 --> 19:44.433
No. You guys?

19:44.516 --> 19:45.934
Yeah, I did. I heard.

19:46.018 --> 19:51.356
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elon Musk,
and Jason Priestley are all members.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.066
Wow, someone's Wikipedia-smart.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.652
Wikipedia.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.321
Have you and I met before?

19:59.239 --> 20:00.115
I don't...

20:00.824 --> 20:01.783
think so.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.871
Silence.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.998
Subservience.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.083
Observance.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.377
You are no longer students.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.546
You're neophytes.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.092
Find the gold coins.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.011
Take only one...

20:21.094 --> 20:23.597
-...or we will know.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.598
Oh, shit.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.820
Where am I?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
How did I end up naked?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.913
Why am I covered in blood?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.795
This can't be blood.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.132
Oh, yeah, that's blood.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.886
Does anyone remember anything?

21:02.970 --> 21:05.973
Only up until that weird meeting,
and then it all goes blank.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.850
I think we did something terrible.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.187
And not the fun kind of terrible.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.232
I just hope we didn't hurt anyone.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.865
You were supposed to tell him, "No magic."

21:25.242 --> 21:26.994
I did tell him "No magic."

21:27.536 --> 21:29.037
So much for your new formula.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.541
It should have worked.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.042
I enchanted it myself.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.003
Then maybe
there's something wrong with you.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.589
They're long gone.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.590
We lost their tracks,

21:40.674 --> 21:42.676
but I have a good idea of where they went.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.512
Go, find them.
Make sure they haven't killed anyone else.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.430
Let's go.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.814
Sorry about your plan, Alyssa.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.234
Thought it had potential.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.653
Any other ideas?

22:03.447 --> 22:07.409
I was thinking that we could try adding
a <i>servitudinis</i> spell the next time around.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.120
They kill someone,
and you want to try again.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.664
Don't blame the disciple for this, Vera.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.417
We all know a fish stinks from the head.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.335
Kepler.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.295
This is a surprise.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.254
Ouch.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.882
How are you gonna
<i>respondeo</i> your way out of this one?

22:21.965 --> 22:22.799
Shaving accident?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.968
Still trying to generate that new eye?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.804
Unforeseen side effect
of a werewolf attack.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.765
Their injuries are harder to heal.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.059
If only we had known earlier.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.604
Forewarned is forearmed.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.107
Well, it's so rare for a werewolf
to leave someone alive.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.984
Case in point.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.778
We'll have this resolved soon enough.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.405
If the Council listened to me
in the first place,

22:45.489 --> 22:46.990
there wouldn't be an issue to resolve.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.909
Is that why you're here, Kepler?

22:48.992 --> 22:51.453
To try and gather ammunition?

22:52.037 --> 22:56.083
I'm here to ensure that
the situation doesn't get out of hand.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.669
But if this is a bad time...

23:00.379 --> 23:01.338
Not at all.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.173
Let us retire to the reliquary.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.633
I'll catch you up to speed.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.136
Clean this up
before a jogger trips over it.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.384
We're your "we."

23:48.635 --> 23:49.761
Hey, think fast!

23:49.845 --> 23:51.388
Wow, nice catch.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.390
It's so weird.

23:53.473 --> 23:58.103
There's this really dope room upstairs
with clothes that fit me.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.271
We had the same luck.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.356
I'd swear we lived here.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.776
Yeah, it's weird.
I do feel like I've been here, but...

24:05.819 --> 24:07.779
definitely haven't lived here before.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.781
That would explain the lack of clothes.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.283
Or you're a pervert.

24:11.366 --> 24:12.451
No judgment.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.410
Pervert.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.327
Thanks.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.663
So many questions.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.665
I need a drink.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.375
But you're not an alcoholic,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.794
-you're an alcohol aficionado.
-Alcohol aficionado.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.505
All right, I'm sure we've met before.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.590
Same.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.301
And I keep getting wave after wave
of déjà vu.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.136
It's been happening ever since I woke up.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.140
It's like memories from the past
that we just can't quite remember.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.266
Someone's coming.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.267
I don't hear anything.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.435
I can...

24:38.977 --> 24:39.978
smell them?

24:40.061 --> 24:41.605
That's ridiculous.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.734
Jack! Jack, are you in there?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.236
Babe!

24:48.945 --> 24:50.155
Oh, God, I was so worried.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.239
You ran off again.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.283
Did you have another blackout?
You did, didn't you?

24:53.366 --> 24:55.535
-A blackout?
-Yeah, they started just after Pete died.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.786
Who's Pete?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.038
His grandfather.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.915
Don't worry,
the doctors call it a fugue state.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.374
-I brought your medication.
-Wait.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.001
-She's lying.
-Let go of me!

25:03.084 --> 25:05.003
They don't have medication
to treat a fugue state,

25:05.086 --> 25:07.297
-only the underlying conditions...
-You're hurting me!

25:07.380 --> 25:09.424
-Jack, help me.
- What the hell is that?

25:10.425 --> 25:11.593
Your last chance.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.844
Oh, God!

25:13.303 --> 25:14.971
I told you it wouldn't work.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.181
-He's pre-med.
-Angus?

25:31.988 --> 25:33.490
Something you want to tell me, "babe"?

25:34.032 --> 25:36.368
You're a dead man. All of you.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.702
You're dead.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.456
I have no idea why,
but I'm really gonna enjoy this.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.795
That is for dyeing my hair.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.047
We should get out of here.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.340
They'll be after us.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.925
Who will be after us?

25:52.008 --> 25:53.093
The Blue Rose people.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.512
Who put tall boy in charge?

25:57.556 --> 25:58.848
A disciple is dead, Vera.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.100
Grand Magus.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.853
How many more have to die before
you realize the stupidity of this notion?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.982
How often did you express your concerns
about dead disciples to Edward?

26:07.065 --> 26:09.568
Was it after the three neophytes
were murdered?

26:09.651 --> 26:11.194
Those deaths were not his fault.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.445
No magic.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.825
What about the Gnostic Councillor

26:16.908 --> 26:18.994
and the neophyte
that he sentenced to death

26:19.077 --> 26:19.911
for those murders?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.205
Did you ever question that decision?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.624
He was performing his duties.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.337
Was he performing his duties
when he dissolved the Gnostic Council?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.256
He said he was speaking metaphorically.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.633
And then there was Hemmings,
his assistants,

26:33.717 --> 26:37.137
every other disciple who died
enforcing Edward's will.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.931
No one could have anticipated
the fallout of his commands.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.768
So then what gives you the right
to think you can question mine?

26:43.852 --> 26:46.938
My job as Gnostic Councillor
is to act as a safeguard.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.440
You did a hell of a job with Edward.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.526
Maybe if you keep your mouth shut
and let me do my job,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
our disciples will have a fighting chance.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.697
You talk a good game, Vera.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.784
But you care about those disciples
about as much as I do.

27:00.243 --> 27:04.289
I bet you can't name
even one of your precious victims.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.003
Weston.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.088
Drea.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.423
Amir.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.799
Margaret.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.051
Gregory.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.719
Kyle.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.262
Jonas.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.805
Hemmings.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.765
Ruby.

27:21.973 --> 27:22.849
Marty.

27:23.099 --> 27:23.975
Diego.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.269
Shall I go on?

27:27.479 --> 27:29.230
Diego should only count as half.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.656
See, werewolves are
powerful practitioners.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.284
If we can harness their power properly,
they will be an asset to the Order.

27:41.951 --> 27:44.037
Perhaps you should put
your prejudices aside

27:44.454 --> 27:45.997
and remember the greater good.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.129
I hate what you've done to the place.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.089
Hm.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.884
Pull, not push.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.770
Nicole's my friend.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.146
Why would she attack me?

28:10.230 --> 28:12.232
She's not your friend. None of them are.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.317
Do you think they're all
part of this Blue Rose cult?

28:14.401 --> 28:17.362
We have to find some place to hide
and just figure out what's happening.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.571
We're safer in public.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.074
We should split up.
We're a pretty conspicuous group.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.992
-We should stick together--

28:34.546 --> 28:35.839
What the hell was that?

28:36.923 --> 28:38.425
-We were changing.
-Into what?

28:38.508 --> 28:41.302
I don't know. Something scary.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.930
-Is that what happened to us last night?
-Yeah, I think so.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.682
So why did it stop this time?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.684
I don't think it stopped.
I think we stopped it.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.728
Is that why our memories are messed up?

28:49.811 --> 28:51.312
Because we're monsters?

28:57.068 --> 28:57.902
Could be a trap.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.446
It's probably a trap.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.905
We have to do something.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.615
Stuck-up skank.

29:07.036 --> 29:07.912
<i>Convertat.</i>

29:23.720 --> 29:24.554
Run!

29:25.430 --> 29:26.264
Come on.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.185
Over here!

29:30.643 --> 29:31.478
Now!

29:37.734 --> 29:39.444
Those guys were right there.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.780
-Not my problem.
-Explaining to Vera will be.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.592
It was... sloppy magic.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.552
Dangerous.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.347
I've never met
a practitioner who'd consider

30:07.430 --> 30:09.349
casting a spell like this
in public before.

30:09.766 --> 30:13.436
Maybe if you tried performing
a <i>convertat</i> incantation,

30:13.520 --> 30:15.522
that student might still be alive.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.525
I... I...

30:18.608 --> 30:20.610
I wish I thought of that.
I guess I just...

30:20.693 --> 30:21.986
I panicked in the moment.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.071
Miss Drake...

30:24.280 --> 30:27.951
you were romantically involved
with the double agent Jack Morton?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.245
Romantic?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.419
There was an attraction,
but then I learned the truth about him.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.548
You know that werewolves
are duplicitous and dangerous,

30:41.631 --> 30:43.967
but you don't suspect them
of this heinous act?

30:45.426 --> 30:48.805
If anything, they'd be trying to stop
whoever performed this incantation.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.098
Magus,

30:50.640 --> 30:54.018
I think in a situation like this,
it's better to be safe than sorry,

30:54.644 --> 30:56.813
especially when
innocent lives are at stake.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.024
Don't you agree?

31:00.108 --> 31:03.444
Grand Magus, there's no way the Knights
would do something this vicious.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.823
Not to an innocent civilian,
not on purpose.

31:07.156 --> 31:11.035
Prepare for another <i>respondeo</i> incantation,
Miss Drake.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.663
You're dismissed.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.925
-You've made the right call.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.344
You're dismissed as well.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.037
Okay. So...

31:54.704 --> 31:56.164
Magic is real.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.208
At least we know what
that ringing means.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.711
What the hell are we?

32:01.794 --> 32:04.088
Aliens? Superheroes?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.799
Alien superheroes.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.301
We're not aliens.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.385
How can you be sure?

32:09.469 --> 32:11.638
I don't know, I just know.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.181
I agree with Kilith.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.643
-More memories.
-Insane.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.479
Ever since we saw that blonde.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.230
The real one.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.649
Alyssa.

32:23.524 --> 32:24.400
You're a monster.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.781
Look, these things inside of us...

32:30.949 --> 32:32.617
I think they want us to remember.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.288
I'm going somewhere I can let mine out.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.595
You guys smell that?

32:54.055 --> 32:54.889
Blood.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.518
We totally killed that masked dude.

32:59.936 --> 33:00.979
Funny.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.231
I don't really have a problem with that.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.441
Probably why we call you Kilith.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.155
Okay, we're here.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.492
Now what?

33:18.079 --> 33:19.622
Whoa, dude.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.291
-Little aggressive, don't you think?

33:33.678 --> 33:34.679
Okay.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.639
I take it back.

33:37.056 --> 33:38.975
That's not scary.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.185
That's badass.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.567
They're not coming back here.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.653
They might, so someone needs to be here.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.238
Might as well be us.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.781
God, I hate it here.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.116
Everything is so...

33:56.242 --> 33:57.910
-antique.
-I like antiques.

33:58.911 --> 33:59.954
Uh-huh.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.081
You like your wolf.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.167
I haven't done anything inappropriate.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.127
Except mess with her mind a little.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.754
Make sure she's into you.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.338
Don't be disgusting.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.966
I would never do anything like that
to someone,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.634
because I'm a professional.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.930
But you like her, right?

34:18.014 --> 34:19.640
Ye-- Yes.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.518
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, I like her.

34:22.602 --> 34:23.478
I'm evil.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.313
I'm an evil person.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.608
I keep trying to make her not like me,
but...

34:28.941 --> 34:31.277
The last time I powdered her,
I tried to make her hate me,

34:31.360 --> 34:33.154
-and it didn't work.

34:34.238 --> 34:35.114
Then go for it.

34:35.198 --> 34:36.157
I can't.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.867
-It's wrong.

34:39.535 --> 34:40.369
Nicole,

34:40.453 --> 34:41.454
you can go.

34:47.043 --> 34:47.919
What about me?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.546
Angus, right?

34:50.838 --> 34:53.758
I've got a plan
to catch the wolves, but, uh...

34:55.051 --> 34:56.594
I need the perfect partner for it.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.096
I'm perfect.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.641
What's the plan?

35:02.892 --> 35:04.602
Right. Um...

35:06.354 --> 35:07.230
Well...

35:11.317 --> 35:13.277
I knock you out
with a simple sleep incantation,

35:13.361 --> 35:15.530
and the sound of my magic
draws the wolves right here.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.115
Sounds g-- Wait, what?

35:17.198 --> 35:18.491
<i>Dormi regulia.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:24.539
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.790
-Shit.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.458
That was not supposed to happen.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.584
Are you okay?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.419
-Can you speak?

35:44.183 --> 35:45.017
Jack?

35:49.480 --> 35:51.023
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.155
Okay.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.825
I know you have a lot of questions

36:01.492 --> 36:02.869
and you're really confused.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.079
But...

36:10.918 --> 36:12.086
I can help you.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.267
You can help a monster?

36:42.825 --> 36:44.160
You're not monsters.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.830
You're the Knights of Saint Christopher.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.749
You're champions.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.586
And we were friends.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.255
Yes.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.259
Close friends,
which is why I can help you.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.930
Your memories, your real memories,
they've been suppressed.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.224
-I can return them.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.851
You need to be human.

37:11.854 --> 37:12.980
What do you think, guys?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.612
Oh. Thank God.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.864
Did you say that we're champions?

37:21.948 --> 37:25.368
Yeah, you mean champions
as in "alien superheroes," right?

37:25.618 --> 37:26.953
Who took our memories?

37:27.036 --> 37:31.082
Okay, I can answer all your questions,
or I can just return your memories.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.167
It's up to you.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.300
Okay, we'll try.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.330
Is this a "Blood in, blood out"
kind of thing?

38:12.540 --> 38:14.625
You have passed our tests...

38:16.210 --> 38:17.878
and proven yourselves worthy.

38:19.922 --> 38:21.048
Thank you.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.093
You may now know the first truth.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.386
Magic...

38:26.137 --> 38:27.013
is real.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.681
Magic is real?

38:28.764 --> 38:29.640
Sure.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.766
Silence!

38:33.853 --> 38:37.231
And with practice, dedication
and commitment,

38:37.315 --> 38:38.733
anything is possible.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.568
Weapons, now.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.038
Damn it.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.205
Yo, magic is real.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.168
Jack Morton.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.295
Randall Carpio.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.630
Lilith Bathory.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.549
Hamish Duke.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.010
You have all been summoned.

39:06.093 --> 39:08.137
Will you heed the call?

39:08.220 --> 39:09.805
-I will.
-I will.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.891
Rise, acolytes.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.506
So was our whole relationship just a test

39:43.589 --> 39:45.549
to see if I have what it takes
to be in the Order?

39:45.633 --> 39:47.009
Oh, hell, no, babe.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.512
-This was just the cherry on top.

39:49.595 --> 39:50.721
We're going to be

39:50.805 --> 39:54.975
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose's
new power couple.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.604
Oh, that's...

39:59.522 --> 40:00.356
just great.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.108
Yeah, it sure is.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.984
Angus, Angus!

40:04.235 --> 40:05.361
Dude!

40:05.444 --> 40:08.072
This is awesome.
We're going to be magic buddies.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.573
Yeah, yeah, it's great.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.950
Yeah, yeah.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.369
So what's the coolest spell you know?

40:13.452 --> 40:17.331
Like, what's the craziest thing you've
ever done with magic? Can you fly?

40:17.748 --> 40:18.916
Can I fly?

40:18.999 --> 40:20.584
Dude, can we fly?

40:20.668 --> 40:23.838
Why didn't you tell me you were
a member of a secret magic society?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.756
You kind of answered your own question.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.717
But I can give you the full story
over dinner?

40:29.718 --> 40:32.179
What's wrong? You've been asking me out
for three months,

40:32.263 --> 40:33.931
and now that I say yes, you don't want to?

40:34.014 --> 40:36.142
-It's not that I don't want to--
-You changed your mind.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.769
I've kept this huge secret from you,
and now you're mad at me.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.938
-No, no, no, please.
-I totally understand.

40:41.021 --> 40:41.856
Nicole, listen.

40:42.857 --> 40:43.691
Okay.

40:45.609 --> 40:46.902
You just caught me by surprise.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.281
I didn't actually think
you would ever say yes,

40:50.656 --> 40:52.366
but dinner...

40:54.618 --> 40:55.786
Dinner would be great.

40:58.164 --> 41:01.834
This is the happiest night of my life.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.263
If you're gonna stand there,
you might as well make yourself useful.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.281
Tonight,

41:32.865 --> 41:36.619
we welcome four new members
into our family.

41:37.244 --> 41:40.331
That is what the Hermetic Order
of the Blue Rose is,

41:40.414 --> 41:41.499
a family.

41:42.583 --> 41:46.212
And it has chosen
each and every one of you...

41:46.754 --> 41:48.339
<i>-to be a member.</i>

41:58.015 --> 41:58.849
<i>Éirí</i>

41:59.517 --> 42:00.809
<i>lag agus</i>

42:01.268 --> 42:02.353
<i>básaigh.</i>

42:04.104 --> 42:05.523
<i>Just like any family,</i>

42:06.106 --> 42:07.983
there are going to be disagreements,

42:08.526 --> 42:09.693
and fights,

42:10.236 --> 42:12.404
and you are going to hate
doing your chores.

42:14.823 --> 42:18.494
Oh,<i> Éirí lag agus básaigh.</i>

42:20.329 --> 42:21.205
<i>Éirí</i>

42:22.039 --> 42:23.541
<i>lag agus</i>

42:23.999 --> 42:24.875
<i>básaigh.</i>

42:29.838 --> 42:32.716
But at the end of the day,
we rally together.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.802
-We protect our own.

42:35.803 --> 42:36.637
And tonight...

42:37.930 --> 42:39.390
we are stronger

42:39.473 --> 42:40.474
because of you.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.854
<i>To our new acolytes.</i>

42:45.938 --> 42:48.315
And to the Hermetic Order
of the Blue Rose.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.733
-Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

43:03.998 --> 43:08.419
Any idea who was performing magic
during Vera's little "Kumbaya" moment?

43:09.044 --> 43:11.380
Probably someone
who was as bored as I was.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.549
Are the ceremonies always so long?

43:13.632 --> 43:14.466
Oh, yeah.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.219
This is my second time
and it doesn't get any better.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.472
See, that's what I love
about our initiation ceremony.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.891
It's brief and casual,

43:22.975 --> 43:24.935
and we get to the drinking
a hell of a lot quicker.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.360
It was nice of Alyssa
to return our memories.

43:33.736 --> 43:34.570
Did she?

43:35.029 --> 43:37.615
Or did she just return the ones
that would get us on side?

43:37.698 --> 43:38.824
She returned them all.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.160
How can you be so sure?

43:41.243 --> 43:43.370
Because I want to kill her
for betraying us.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.872
You'll have to get in line.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.958
If the Order finds out what she did,
they'll kill her.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.126
And us.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.046
We better make sure that doesn't happen.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.213
How do we do that?

43:53.297 --> 43:54.673
Let them think they've won.

43:55.007 --> 43:55.841
They have won.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.721
They stole all our magic crap,
our journals, our hide lockers.

44:00.804 --> 44:01.889
They have Silverback.

44:01.972 --> 44:02.931
We'll get him back.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.142
We'll get it all back.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.560
Sounds like you got a plan.

44:07.519 --> 44:08.354
Not yet.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.940
But when the time is right,
we're gonna make them pay.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.779
All of them.

44:24.536 --> 44:27.498
And then we're gonna burn this place
to the fucking ground.
