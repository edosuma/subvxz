WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:11.428
Well, the race is on to save a young,
British Asian man, Hassan Ahmed,

00:11.512 --> 00:14.806
who has been kidnapped
by members of a far right group

00:14.890 --> 00:17.684
calling themselves the Sons of Albion.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.354
-The kidnappers have made no demands…
-Jesus.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.189
…and it appears
the authorities are no closer…

00:22.272 --> 00:23.815
-Shit.
-…to discovering his whereabouts.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.442
-So bleak.
-Yeah.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.945
I mean, we're behind the scenes,
and we know nothing.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.322
Well, we know the bastards
are gonna kill him.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.533
-Yeah, because they haven't made--
-Made any demands, yeah.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.244
…how and, indeed, why he was targeted

00:35.327 --> 00:36.620
beyond his ethnic background.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
Do you think Lamb knows what's going on?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.875
Well, I'm sure he could find out
if he wanted to.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.418
I'm not sure he cares.

00:43.502 --> 00:47.506
You know, Lamb's password is "password."

00:47.589 --> 00:48.924
"Password"?

00:49.007 --> 00:51.051
-How do you know?
-Ho told me.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.762
-And what did that cost you?
-Nothing.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.724
He just wanted to tell someone, didn't he?
To prove how clever he is.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.479
How much do you think
the Park's gonna be telling Lamb?

01:02.563 --> 01:06.316
I mean, we could find out. He's bound
to be copied in on updates for live ops.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.406
But… probably shouldn't.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.242
Do you want another drink?

01:15.742 --> 01:18.495
Yeah, maybe. Or…

01:19.121 --> 01:21.164
I don't know. Maybe back to the office.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.670
Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, it's better
than getting pissed here, isn't it?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.255
-Not helping, are we?
-Exactly. No.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.715
-Yeah.
-Last order at the bar, guys.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.008
Okay, thanks. Another drink?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.759
Okay, but something quick. Shots.

01:35.554 --> 01:39.391
-Oh, my God. I don't know--
-Can you hurry up?

01:39.474 --> 01:40.601
-Can I just do it?
-Here.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.352
-'Cause it's really painful to watch.
-Go on.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.229
-All right. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.440
-Want to see my technique in action?
-Yeah.

01:46.940 --> 01:47.941
Okay.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.279
Arse.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.531
You have to turn the handle at the same--

01:55.866 --> 01:58.702
How have you still not learned
how to open the fricking door?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.245
-But that was smooth.
-Uh-huh.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.414
-That was smooth as you like.
-According to who?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.918
What? Me. That was cool.
Cool as a cucumber. All right, shush.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.252
-Try and be quiet.
-No, you sh--

02:07.336 --> 02:08.628
Try, if you can.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.380
I can't see.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.548
Right, turn that w--

02:11.632 --> 02:13.425
Let me get the light.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.859
Sorry. Am I not doing it right?

02:30.943 --> 02:33.153
-I haven't-- It's been a while.
-Did you hear that?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.781
Hear what?

02:35.864 --> 02:36.949
I don't know. A noise.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.116
Like a mouse?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.409
Do we have mice?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.746
Yeah. Yeah, we've got lots of mice.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.748
Or something that does mouse droppings
around the place.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.166
-Shut up.
-Ho.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.090
Okay, I heard that.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.429
I think it was Lamb's office.
Sounded like Lamb's office.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.473
I don't know. There's no lights on.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.923
Wait. Are you sure we wanna do this?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.217
What else should we be doing?

03:37.301 --> 03:40.304
Well, I mean, I'd rather be doing
what we were just doing.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.223
-God.
-All right. Of course. Priorities.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.255
No.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.675
Corkboard?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.928
No, there were two noises.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.263
Well, maybe it bounced.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.725
Okay.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.329
Fuck it.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.957
So, what now?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.001
Do you wanna go back to my place
or we go back to yours?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.255
Let's do one more sweep.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.102
Min? Min!

05:12.771 --> 05:13.772
Min.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.358
-Min, you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.943
-Min?
-The gun, the gun.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.781
-You okay?
-Fine. I'm fine.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.244
No pulse. I think you broke his neck.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.954
He broke his own fucking neck.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.790
Oh, my God.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.795
Oh, my God.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.922
-Fuck.
-What the fuck?

06:34.728 --> 06:37.898
Dr. Lawrence, come to surgical three.
Non-emergency.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.400
Dr. Lawrence, please.
Dr. Lawrence, please.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.904
Dr. Lawrence, come to surgical three.
Non-emergency.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.599
Can I help you, sir?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.647
Think you must be lost, sir.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.650
They'll help you at reception
with whatever you're after.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.593
A shoe…

07:49.344 --> 07:50.512
in a bag?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.265
I'm embarrassed for you.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.563
Wait, wait, wait.
He's got my phone and my pass.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.071
-Take all the time you need.
-Yeah.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.413
Sorry. Sidonie Baker, do you where she's--

08:17.080 --> 08:18.415
Lamb.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.877
Lamb, I can't just leave
without knowing how she is.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.587
She's still on the table.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.173
What do you mean? Is she gonna make it?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.800
Why the fuck
did you ride in the ambulance?

08:28.884 --> 08:32.011
I thought she was dying. I'm not
just gonna fucking leave her there, am I?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.679
-Would you?
-Yes.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.682
It was a dumb dick move.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.061
Once you called it in, your ID
was flashing lights and sounding whistles

08:39.144 --> 08:40.604
from here to Regent's Park.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.272
That's why that Dog was waiting for you.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.859
Wait, how did you know I was here?

08:45.943 --> 08:47.319
'Cause once you went walkabout,

08:47.402 --> 08:50.030
-I got Ho to monitor the Park's alerts.
-Why?

08:50.113 --> 08:52.282
In case you did something
as stupid as you did.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.629
Okay.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.590
They-- They say she might live.

09:08.674 --> 09:09.842
Thank Christ.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.556
No thanks to you.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.606
No indication as yet

09:24.690 --> 09:27.067
that the authorities know
where Hassan is being held.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.480
Police are now saying

10:05.564 --> 10:10.068
the threat to Leeds University student
Hassan is grave and imminent.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.071
His liaison officers remain
with Hassan's parents,

10:13.155 --> 10:16.283
but it has been some hours
since anyone has been seen

10:16.366 --> 10:18.952
entering or, indeed, leaving the house.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.955
Well, I believe we can go
to a live press briefing

10:22.039 --> 10:24.541
-being given by West Yorkshire Police.
-Yeah?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.377
Cartwright's gone. I think it was Lamb.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.462
Find them.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.882
Hassan Ahmed was here
after he left this comedy club,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.550
The Last Laugh, at approximately 11…

10:41.767 --> 10:42.935
Slough House?

10:43.560 --> 10:44.978
Why have you brought me back here?

10:45.604 --> 10:46.688
Because you're my agent,

10:46.772 --> 10:49.191
and you were there
when another of my agents was shot,

10:49.274 --> 10:51.276
so I'm doing your debrief.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.196
What the hell
were you two doing at Hobden's?

10:55.864 --> 10:58.200
He's got something on his laptop
that the Park want.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.452
I think he's connected to the kidnappers.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.454
Sid thought this too?

11:03.247 --> 11:04.998
Well, she followed me following Hobden.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.379
She told me she'd been put
in Slough House to watch me.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.510
Was that before
or after she got shot in the head?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.107
Who was it?

11:30.899 --> 11:32.025
Who was what?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.986
Who shot her, you pillock?

11:34.069 --> 11:37.698
I don't know. I couldn't see his face.
He had a balaclava on and tactical gear.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.366
So, a pro?

11:40.742 --> 11:43.620
Yeah. But-- Well, kind of.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.622
For fuck's sake, Cartwright.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.165
-I--
-God.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.294
Can you let me think
for one minute? Would that be fine?

11:54.256 --> 11:56.466
I don't know. It was strange.
It was like he--

11:57.176 --> 11:59.636
he wanted me to think
that he was one of the Dogs.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.806
But it just-- It wasn't quite right.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.146
And he didn't speak the whole time.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.276
Like he was worried
I might recognize his voice.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.360
God.

12:35.464 --> 12:39.510
There's your answer, Cartwright.
Jed fucking Moody.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.430
If you had issues with him,
I could have spoken to HR.

12:43.514 --> 12:44.806
No, we didn't know it was him.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.142
-He jumped out.
-I'm not sure that counts as a defense.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.644
He had a gun.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.229
Better. He used it earlier.

12:50.312 --> 12:53.232
-Shot Sid Baker with it.
-What, he killed Sid? Why?

12:53.315 --> 12:54.900
No. She's fine. She's alive.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.235
She was 20 minutes ago.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.446
But wait. Why the fuck did he shoot her?
Where were they?

13:00.614 --> 13:03.534
We were at Robert Hobden's.
Sid followed me. I never asked her to.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.077
What was Moody doing there?

13:05.160 --> 13:08.080
I don't know why he was there.
He broke in dressed like this.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.832
-What was he doing here?
-Well, we didn't get a chance to ask.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.210
But he'd been in your office.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.003
Your corkboard was off the wall.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.425
Can you account for your movements?

13:20.509 --> 13:23.512
-Well, we were over the road. And…
-In the pub.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.056
Fuck me.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.685
If this is nicer than going back
to your place, I pity you.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.521
Where's the gun?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.647
It's over there.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.191
He looked like using it?

13:39.278 --> 13:41.947
Look, let's get this straight.
This is not a court of law.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.949
Did he look like using it?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.201
He didn't point it exactly, no.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.871
Yeah, well, you might want to reconsider
your position on that.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.374
-I didn't mean to kill him.
-Of course you didn't.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.293
If you meant to kill him,
he'd still be alive.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.254
What's this?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.299
Dirty bastard.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.967
What, was he gonna bug your office?

14:02.926 --> 14:05.596
It'd be an odd move
after shooting one of my joes.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.473
No, he was cleaning up.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.309
Prior to getting out.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.102
Well…

14:12.603 --> 14:14.521
the prostitutes of Paraguay,

14:14.605 --> 14:17.608
or whichever non-extradition destination
he was headed for,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.234
have had a lucky escape.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.410
Two mobiles.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.329
Jed, Jed, Jed.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.540
I'm surprised
you had enough friends to carry one.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.588
This one's barely used.
Just one incoming call.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.672
You should ring it.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.092
Thank fuck you're here.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.845
I would never have thought of that.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.851
Moody?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.646
I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone right now.

14:56.605 --> 14:57.814
Jackson.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.358
We need to talk.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.488
Come on.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.325
-Yes?
-I need to see him.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.743
It's very late, sir.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.246
-I know that. Is he here?
-Who shall I say, sir?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.122
Hobden. It's Robert Hobden.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.378
Just save us all a lot of back and forth.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.880
Just tell him,
if he's not receiving guests now,

15:21.964 --> 15:24.299
he will need to make himself available
in the morning,

15:24.383 --> 15:28.387
'cause there will be cameras out front
and tabloids trying to get in the back.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.941
Wait here.

15:57.708 --> 16:01.295
Robert Hobden, as I live and breathe
and shag like a lord.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.963
Good to see you, old chum.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.882
Timing's a little off.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.634
But when a friend drops by,
my door is always open,

16:07.718 --> 16:10.345
and my wine is waiting to be uncorked.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.181
I've got this, Seb.
Give us a moment, would you?

16:13.974 --> 16:17.060
What the fuck are you doing here,
you stupid fucking twat?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.979
I have been trying to contact you.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.566
I've been avoiding your calls.
Take the hint. You're fucking toxic.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.568
-Did anyone see you arrive?
-I don't know.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.821
-What kind of prick answer is that?
-It's the only prick answer I've got.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.199
What happened?

16:31.241 --> 16:33.577
Someone tried to kill me tonight.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.912
Well, a lot of fanatics about.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.873
-You're not the most popular--
-It wasn't a fanatic. It was a spook.

16:37.956 --> 16:38.957
A spook?

16:39.041 --> 16:43.253
MI5 sent a man, masked man, to my flat,
with a gun, to get my laptop.

16:43.337 --> 16:46.548
Fucking hell! I don't know where
anything is. I hardly ever come in here.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.344
Why would MI5 want your computer?

16:50.427 --> 16:54.473
Because I have intel about the kidnapping.
The Muslim boy.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.058
Why should I care about the kidnapping?

16:56.141 --> 16:59.478
I've already made enough of a tit
of myself, claiming it was ISIS.

16:59.561 --> 17:03.357
Because your entire career has been
playing the nationalist card.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.401
And if that boy dies,
the closest you'll get to Downing Street

17:06.484 --> 17:09.195
is looking down on it
from an open-top bus.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.055
You alone?

17:38.684 --> 17:41.228
Don't know why
they had to clean up the canals.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.399
There was a time
you could find an oil drum

17:45.482 --> 17:48.485
or a corpse to use as a target.

17:58.412 --> 17:59.955
What do you think you're playing at?

18:00.664 --> 18:03.333
Well, that's fucking choice,
considering I lent you an agent

18:03.417 --> 18:05.252
for what you said was
a run-of-the-mill op,

18:05.335 --> 18:06.879
who now has a bullet in her head.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.423
"What do you think you're playing at?"
is my line,

18:09.506 --> 18:11.425
with a few fucking fucks thrown in.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.969
I'm sorry, but the brief was not
for her to be on Hobden 24/7.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.221
No, the brief was
to be on Cartwright 24/7.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.808
Which makes me think
she was your agent all along,

18:19.892 --> 18:21.727
and you were just asking for show.

18:23.478 --> 18:27.357
-Where was she when she was--
-She was shot outside Hobden's.

18:28.192 --> 18:33.488
Intentionally or otherwise, by Jed Moody,
another one of your recruits.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.115
So, if I may be so bold,

18:35.199 --> 18:37.201
what the living fuck do you think
you're playing at?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.203
Check the rule book, Lamb.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.748
You run Slough House, and God knows
no one wants to take that away from you,

18:42.831 --> 18:45.542
but I am Second Desk, head of ops,

18:45.626 --> 18:47.377
which means directing personnel.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.380
All personnel. Yours or anybody else's.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.052
Better out than in.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.846
God, you're vile.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.390
Actually, maybe not.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.270
So, say you're right
and this is none of my business,

19:06.146 --> 19:08.815
what do I do about the body
on my staircase?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.985
-Moody?
-Yeah.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.112
He's dead?

19:14.196 --> 19:17.282
It's hard to tell, given his IQ, but yes.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.659
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

19:18.742 --> 19:22.371
But if you wanted to subcontract,
you could've done better than Jed Moody.

19:22.454 --> 19:26.625
Even when he was good, he wasn't any good.
The guy's a fucking fridge magnet.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.001
-Who took him down?
-W--

19:28.502 --> 19:31.630
Here's the funny part.
He forgot to tie his shoelaces.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.258
He fell down the stairs.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.470
Yes. When you're in front of Limitations,

19:38.554 --> 19:40.973
you might want to leave out
the bit about that being funny.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.017
Limitations.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.479
So, do we call in the Dogs?

19:47.563 --> 19:49.481
Hell, it's a death, Diana.

19:49.565 --> 19:52.192
I could call the police. I should.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.236
I've got a mobile phone on me.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.280
Yeah, I could use that.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.073
Yeah, I found it on Moody's body.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.743
The odd thing is,
the only number in it is yours.

20:01.827 --> 20:03.412
Yeah, you've made your point.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.000
It's after 02:00, Diana.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.335
And my team is smaller
than it was yesterday.

20:10.419 --> 20:14.631
You've got till I finish this fag
before I start making calls.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.177
Okay.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.848
I was talking to my brother
at the Frontline Club.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.394
And I mentioned we were developing
operations to neutralize the nationalists.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.146
You are fucking kidding me.

20:29.229 --> 20:33.066
Sons of Albion have links to groups
all under Simmonds's umbrella.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.027
I can use this to roll them all up.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.946
So, you set up some half-arsed scheme

20:38.030 --> 20:42.034
involving a neofascist group
kidnapping a Muslim kid

20:42.117 --> 20:44.745
and threatening to chop his head off
on YouTube?

20:44.828 --> 20:47.873
Except it's not going to happen
'cause one of the group is yours.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.249
-Close?
-Half-arsed?

20:49.333 --> 20:52.586
One dead and one in intensive care
because what?

20:52.669 --> 20:55.172
You think
Hobden's got a piece of the puzzle?

20:56.715 --> 20:58.634
When I went to the bar
at the Frontline Club,

20:58.717 --> 21:00.802
I saw Hobden in the booth behind us.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.681
Bad tradecraft on my part, no question.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.852
You thought he might have
overheard you or recorded it?

21:08.936 --> 21:10.979
That's why you needed to know what he had.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.152
Do you have any proof?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.615
No, but MI5 must think I do.
That's why they tried to kill me tonight.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.368
And you come here,
leaving a trail of mad, shitty footprints.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.205
-I don't want to be caught up in this.
-You're already caught up in this.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.999
You have to warn them and get them out!

21:31.083 --> 21:32.167
And say what?

21:32.793 --> 21:38.006
Tell them that this whole setup,
this supposed execution, is a fake.

21:38.090 --> 21:41.593
That the Sons of Albion, who've never been
more than a bunch of moronic street thugs,

21:41.677 --> 21:43.929
have been set up
by the intelligence services.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.764
By an agent provocateur.

21:45.848 --> 21:48.141
And I'm to, what,
announce this in the House?

21:48.225 --> 21:49.309
Or maybe on the Today program?

21:49.393 --> 21:52.771
Peter, we've known each other for years.
Don't try and fob me off.

21:52.855 --> 21:54.648
We are not friends, Robert.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.859
You've always treated me fairly in print,
and I respect that.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.485
But let's face it,
you're a fucking has-been,

21:58.569 --> 22:01.154
and it's no longer appropriate
to be associated with you.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.407
So take it somewhere else.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.576
Maybe to your pals
in the British Patriotic Party.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.160
What? They won't believe me.

22:07.244 --> 22:10.497
Well, I can't warn these Sons of Whatever.
I don't know the fuckers.

22:10.581 --> 22:13.125
But you know people who know people.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.085
You have to warn them.

22:15.169 --> 22:18.505
You have to get the word out.
A spy's in their midst.

22:18.589 --> 22:21.717
A rescue will be staged,
and they will all be killed.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.094
I'm a respected
and much-loved national figure.

22:24.178 --> 22:27.222
I don't have any of the contacts
you're talking about, you mad bastard.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.765
Peter, you're needed!

22:30.184 --> 22:31.393
The second I go upstairs,

22:31.476 --> 22:33.645
you get the fuck out of here,
or I'll have Seb drag you out.

22:33.729 --> 22:35.439
I have the photo of you at the rally.

22:35.522 --> 22:39.610
Darling, Nahim and Ursula
are going to go very soon.

22:39.693 --> 22:42.905
Already? And skipping cheese, are they?
I'll see about that.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.948
Let's open some port
and tempt them to stay.

22:45.449 --> 22:47.242
Would your friend care to join us?

22:47.326 --> 22:50.412
Rob and I have been discussing some
very official secret hush-hush, darling.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.122
No one's supposed to know he's here.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.249
You wait here, bud.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.544
I'll settle things upstairs
and be back in a jiffy.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.888
I can't help but notice you seem,
you know, pretty relaxed

23:07.971 --> 23:10.140
for someone who set up
a false flag operation

23:10.224 --> 23:14.728
to behead an innocent kid
in what… four hours.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.563
They're not gonna do it.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.441
Their core messaging suggests
they very much are.

23:19.525 --> 23:22.152
Our agent told them
they didn't actually need a beheading.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.738
They just had to show
that they could do it if pushed.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.991
That's a hell of a gamble.
I wouldn't fancy your odds.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.326
You underestimate me.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.662
The boy was chosen with care.

23:33.539 --> 23:34.790
The kid. Who is he?

23:35.374 --> 23:37.960
He's Mahmud Gul's nephew. Gul is--

23:38.043 --> 23:40.838
I know who Mahmud fucking Gul is.

23:40.921 --> 23:44.049
He's number two
in Pakistan's military intelligence.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.592
And this gets you what?

23:45.676 --> 23:47.010
We will rescue his nephew,

23:47.094 --> 23:50.973
and if that gets us even 10%
more cooperation with the Pakistanis,

23:51.056 --> 23:52.099
it will be worth it.

23:52.182 --> 23:54.935
If this goes tits up-- and Christ knows
it hasn't gone right yet--

23:55.018 --> 23:57.396
you've assassinated his nephew!

23:57.479 --> 24:00.148
-Our man is--
-"Your man."

24:00.941 --> 24:03.402
This isn't a sanctioned service op, Diana.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.070
This is off the books!

24:05.153 --> 24:08.866
This is pirate shit!
Now you've got Hobden in the wind!

24:10.075 --> 24:11.243
You gotta roll this up!

24:12.536 --> 24:13.954
-It can still work.
-It--

24:14.037 --> 24:17.958
-This can neutralize the far right.
-It can't.

24:35.350 --> 24:37.102
How the fuck is he sleepin'?

24:37.644 --> 24:40.772
I know I couldn't sleep with what he
thinks is about to happen. I know that.

24:42.733 --> 24:44.568
He won't have slept since we grabbed him.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.321
He must be exhausted.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.489
You wanna go down
and sing him a lullaby, do you?

24:55.996 --> 24:56.997
Fuck's sake.

24:58.624 --> 24:59.666
I'll mute it.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.211
Can still see the lights.

25:50.509 --> 25:51.927
-Little fucker!
-Bastard!

25:52.594 --> 25:53.971
Come on then.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.391
Get down there.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.061
Help! Somebody help me!

26:01.812 --> 26:03.230
Somebody help me, please!

26:03.313 --> 26:04.481
-Grab his legs!
-No, no.

26:04.565 --> 26:07.442
-Somebody help me! No!
-Get him down from there!

26:07.526 --> 26:10.696
-Help me! Help me! Help!
-Get the fucker out of here.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.117
Just humor me and explore the flip side.

26:15.701 --> 26:18.287
If those Sons of Nonsense get wind
of what you're up to,

26:18.370 --> 26:20.539
that kid is as good as dead,
and your man too.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.916
You've gotta call him
and tell him his cover's blown.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.711
Not possible.
He wanted them to go dark. No phones.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.297
Send in the Dogs early.

26:28.881 --> 26:31.383
If we bring it forward,
we need to let him know

26:31.466 --> 26:33.343
so he can secure Hassan
and get out himself.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.846
-Yeah. Well, lots of luck with that one.
-You're gonna help me.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.390
Oh, no, I'm not.
And nor are any of my people.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.766
They brought the boy to London.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.102
They're holding him in a house
this side of the river.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.855
All I'm asking you to do is
literally knock on the door.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.523
Our man will answer, and…

26:47.649 --> 26:49.943
-What's the signal?
-Your face is the signal.

26:50.777 --> 26:51.987
My face?

26:52.070 --> 26:54.573
You're a legend in the service, Jackson.

26:55.407 --> 26:58.493
He'll recognize your face
and know something's about to go down.

26:58.577 --> 27:01.705
He'll secure Hassan,
and Dogs will be right behind you.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.790
They'll go in and do the dirty work.

27:06.543 --> 27:09.046
I've got other things
I could do tonight, Diana.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.174
I've got a really massive shit brewin'.

27:12.257 --> 27:14.968
I could sit and read a book
and birth that beauty.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.058
Was Moody alone when he died?

27:21.808 --> 27:24.269
We're all alone in the end,
don't you think, Diana?

27:24.353 --> 27:25.854
In those final moments?

27:25.938 --> 27:27.648
If he did have company,

27:28.315 --> 27:31.401
that company might
come under intense scrutiny.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.362
By all means, call in the Dogs.

27:33.445 --> 27:35.322
And when they're finished
tearing you apart,

27:35.405 --> 27:38.367
maybe they'll have enough strength
to pick at the rest of this.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.619
Either way, I couldn't give a monkey's.

27:41.286 --> 27:43.080
Even if it was Standish?

27:45.791 --> 27:48.377
You're tossin' darts.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.838
Standish wasn't there.
She's at home asleep.

27:50.921 --> 27:52.673
I'm not talking about tonight.

27:52.756 --> 27:55.592
I'm talking about the night
Charles Partner died.

27:56.510 --> 28:00.764
Catherine Standish came very close
to a treason charge.

28:01.849 --> 28:04.393
That file could be reopened, reassessed.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.895
Didn't fly then. It won't fly now.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.939
A lot of other things might come out.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.737
That is not a can of worms
you want to open.

28:15.821 --> 28:17.489
Do I look keen?

28:20.909 --> 28:22.995
Like it or not,
Slough House is part of this now.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.746
You'll all get turned over.

28:25.247 --> 28:29.209
Standish will find out some things
it would be better for her not to know.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.348
I'll go knock on the door for you.

28:45.809 --> 28:49.605
But in return, I want the Standish file.

28:52.482 --> 28:56.069
And you've been using Slough House
as your personal toy box,

28:56.153 --> 28:57.279
which pisses me off.

28:57.362 --> 28:58.780
-Are we clear?
-Crystal.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.073
There's more.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.577
Moody disappears.

29:04.745 --> 29:07.706
Baker, a victim of street crime.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.376
Anyone with me tonight is fireproof.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.839
And you are in my debt
until you're in a care home.

29:15.923 --> 29:18.091
God, you really care about them,
don't you?

29:19.718 --> 29:22.930
Nah. I think
they're a bunch of fucking losers.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.266
But they're my losers.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.397
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Baker.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.108
I'll have that marked on her chart.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.779
You know, the one that clips
to the bottom of her bed

29:38.862 --> 29:40.989
that tells you
when her catheter needs changin'.

29:49.998 --> 29:55.170
I apologize for the threat,
but I do need you to listen to me.

29:55.754 --> 29:56.755
Don't you see?

29:56.839 --> 30:00.175
They want everyone to forget

30:00.259 --> 30:04.096
about body parts on the tube.

30:04.179 --> 30:08.016
Madmen with swords,
hacking people to bits on bridges.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.476
But instead, we'll have footage

30:09.560 --> 30:13.647
of our brave spooks
rescuin' some brown-skinned boy

30:13.730 --> 30:16.358
and paintin' the right
as a bunch of murdering bastards.

30:18.944 --> 30:20.612
Do you want them to get away with it?

30:20.696 --> 30:25.075
This will stop you from taking your party
and your country further to the right.

30:26.410 --> 30:28.287
That ground will be poisoned,

30:28.370 --> 30:33.083
and there'll be a swing
to happy-clappy, rainbow Britain.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.460
Where the rights of the minority

30:35.544 --> 30:38.422
drown out the rights
of the true-born majority,

30:38.505 --> 30:40.174
and you'll have to go along with it.

30:40.257 --> 30:43.844
And that will pain you.
And I know that you're with me on this.

30:46.138 --> 30:50.392
Now I don't want to have to use that photo
to make you do this.

30:50.475 --> 30:52.269
I want you to do this willingly.

30:59.234 --> 31:01.069
Listen to me, fucko.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.739
That photo doesn't exist.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.158
If it did, anyone who was in it

31:06.241 --> 31:09.369
would make sure all copies
and negatives were destroyed.

31:10.579 --> 31:14.416
But say it did exist
and you somehow had a copy.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.253
I can brush it off
quicker than you can cream your piles.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.547
"It's photoshopped.

31:20.631 --> 31:23.050
It's a wave, not a Nazi salute.

31:23.133 --> 31:25.677
It was fancy dress.
Poor taste, but not a crime.

31:26.303 --> 31:29.097
I was young and drunk and stupid,

31:29.181 --> 31:32.017
and this is not the man
I know myself to be.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.394
Here's ten grand
to an anti-fascist group."

31:36.355 --> 31:39.816
Now get the fuck out of my house before
I punch you so hard, I break my fist.

31:47.866 --> 31:48.867
Seb.

31:54.665 --> 31:57.417
You want me to follow him?
Warn him off a return visit?

31:57.501 --> 32:00.045
No, but I'll need you to make some calls.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.923
Fuck! That was close.

32:04.091 --> 32:08.303
He is a horrible, slippery little prick.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.973
Yeah. Well, he's not goin' anywhere now,

32:11.557 --> 32:13.225
so if either of you wanna doze off.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.977
Nah. I'm pretty wired now.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.272
No. I'm stayin' awake,
because I don't trust this little bastard.

32:18.355 --> 32:21.775
Easy. All in good time. All in good time.

32:21.859 --> 32:23.443
Where's fucking laughing boy?

32:23.527 --> 32:26.363
Don't know. Probably upstairs,
havin' a bubble bath.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.700
All right, let's have some fun then.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.370
Might as well make some money off you two.

32:35.330 --> 32:36.331
Who's in?

32:36.832 --> 32:38.792
-I'm all for a game of cards.
-Yeah, all right.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.378
Let's get rid of some of these bottles.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.297
-Don't be falling asleep in there.
-Yeah, go on.

32:54.308 --> 32:55.517
What happened to the gun?

33:00.314 --> 33:02.733
All right. Come on, pillocks.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.120
Keep an eye on the place, eh, Jed?

33:18.999 --> 33:21.627
-Has anyone else got a car here?
-I have.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.630
-You in a fit state to drive?
-I can drive.

33:24.713 --> 33:26.340
I hold my drink better than Min.

33:26.423 --> 33:28.800
All right. Cartwright, you're with me.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.261
You two fuckbirds follow.

33:31.345 --> 33:32.554
Where we going?

33:32.638 --> 33:34.306
Roupell Street. South of the river.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.058
-Why?
-To assist with the rescue

33:36.141 --> 33:37.226
of Hassan Ahmed.

33:43.690 --> 33:44.691
Speaking this morning,

33:44.775 --> 33:47.069
the Prime Minister described
the kidnappers as pure evil.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.987
Government is doing
plenty of tough talking…

33:49.071 --> 33:53.200
The kidnappers are claiming to be
from a group called the Sons of Albion.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.910
…despicable and ghastly acts.

33:54.993 --> 33:57.829
The fear is that
another British citizen is going to die…

33:57.913 --> 34:00.040
The British government now finds itself

34:00.123 --> 34:02.918
fighting international terrorism
on its home turf.

34:03.001 --> 34:07.089
…as extremely worrying
and added the investigation continues…

34:07.172 --> 34:09.757
The deadline set
by the men holding Hassan Ahmed

34:09.842 --> 34:12.386
is now less than four hours away.

34:27.109 --> 34:29.527
Proceed. Lamb will knock. You clean up.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.445
Go!

35:01.268 --> 35:03.478
-It was money, wasn't it?
-What?

35:03.562 --> 35:06.023
"What?" Come on.
In that envelope you took off Moody.

35:06.106 --> 35:09.151
It's your flight fund,
in case you need to make a run for it.

35:09.234 --> 35:12.613
Flight fund?
Why, I haven't heard that for a long time.

35:12.696 --> 35:15.782
-Where'd you get that? Your grandfather?
-How much?

35:16.617 --> 35:18.035
Fifteen hundred,

35:18.118 --> 35:21.246
a passport and a key to a box.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.207
-Switzerland?
-Fuck you, Switzerland.

35:23.290 --> 35:27.544
Bank in a two-donkey French town
four hours' drive from Paris.

35:27.628 --> 35:29.046
Why am I telling you all this?

35:30.380 --> 35:32.382
Probably so you'd have
an excuse to kill me.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.468
That's probably it.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.810
Home Office, ma'am. Barrowby.

35:44.561 --> 35:47.105
Tell him I'm operational.
I'll call him back when I can.

35:47.606 --> 35:48.607
Yes, ma'am.

35:52.569 --> 35:54.821
Do you think he can breathe in there?

35:54.905 --> 35:55.989
Get a move on.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.574
He hasn't moved in ages.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.243
That's 'cause he's tied to a chair.

36:03.914 --> 36:05.499
You can breathe, can't you?

36:06.875 --> 36:09.419
Don't piss about. Nod.
I know you can hear me.

36:09.503 --> 36:10.504
See? He's fine.

36:14.675 --> 36:15.676
Fifteen.

36:18.929 --> 36:19.763
Call.

36:21.890 --> 36:22.891
Fifteen.

36:24.601 --> 36:25.811
Where have you been?

36:26.562 --> 36:27.980
Hugging a pillow and crying?

36:30.732 --> 36:32.943
Hey, what were you doing up there?

36:33.527 --> 36:34.528
Just thinking.

36:35.112 --> 36:36.905
Thought I heard a dull clang.

36:37.781 --> 36:39.283
Want me to deal you in?

36:39.366 --> 36:41.076
Playing for real money though.

36:41.159 --> 36:42.786
You may not have the stones for that.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.038
I'll raise another 30.

36:45.831 --> 36:47.124
What regiment were you in?

36:47.207 --> 36:49.168
-What?
-In the army.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.629
You know,
when you were out killing towelheads.

36:53.547 --> 36:54.631
Marines.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.508
Asked about the regiment--

36:56.592 --> 36:58.218
Marines don't have regiments.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.888
It's battalion units known as commandos.

37:00.971 --> 37:02.848
Stop makin' a twat of yourself.

37:05.726 --> 37:06.727
Well?

37:09.938 --> 37:10.939
All in.

37:17.779 --> 37:18.864
Bollocks to it.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.744
Looks like you two
are finally growing a dick.

37:24.369 --> 37:25.746
One between you.

37:26.455 --> 37:28.457
You haven't used one of these though,
have you?

37:30.876 --> 37:31.877
Put it down.

37:32.753 --> 37:33.754
No.

37:34.671 --> 37:36.673
It feels good in my hand.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.470
All it'd take is one swing, I reckon.

37:42.804 --> 37:44.264
Cut right through.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.267
Put it down before you fuck everything up.

37:48.519 --> 37:49.603
Hold on.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.481
So, killing him now
would fuck everything up?

37:55.609 --> 37:56.652
That's odd.

37:57.486 --> 37:59.154
I mean, what are you talkin' about, mate?

38:00.864 --> 38:03.367
I thought we were strikin' a blow
for Britain at sunrise.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.119
Look.

38:07.162 --> 38:09.665
At the end of this,
I report to Simmonds, yeah?

38:10.415 --> 38:13.544
Now, I can tell him you're a good soldier.
You get a pat on the back.

38:14.545 --> 38:19.716
Or I can tell him you're a twat liability
and have his boys break your spine.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.302
Up to you.

38:42.948 --> 38:44.074
You little prick.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.036
-Full house, dickheads.
-Bollocks.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.204
-Hey!
-No!

39:06.221 --> 39:07.598
Seems pretty quiet.

39:07.681 --> 39:11.059
What'd you expect?
Balloons tied to the door?

39:15.981 --> 39:18.734
Whoa. Why are you takin' a gun
if you just have to knock on the door?

39:18.817 --> 39:21.361
Because this whole op is fucked up.

39:22.404 --> 39:25.532
Taverner's playin' London rules,
but I'm the one in joe country,

39:25.616 --> 39:28.035
so I'll play Moscow rules. Thank you.

39:41.590 --> 39:42.591
Hey.

39:43.217 --> 39:45.052
What are you doin'?

39:45.135 --> 39:46.386
Stroking a cat.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.037
Shit!

40:14.081 --> 40:15.082
Go around the back!

40:20.003 --> 40:21.296
Lamb?

40:23.966 --> 40:24.967
Lamb?

40:25.634 --> 40:26.635
Kitchen.

40:37.855 --> 40:38.856
Oh, fuck.
