01:54.250 --> 01:56.250
<i>The police investigation continues</i>

01:56.250 --> 01:58.708
<i>at Trent Hamilton Agricultural College
in Shropshire,</i>

01:58.708 --> 02:02.500
<i>after one of its students was arrested
for membership of the IRA.</i>

02:02.500 --> 02:07.583
<i>The authorities are concerned
that Kevin Barry, 22, from County Tyrone,</i>

02:07.583 --> 02:11.208
<i>may have been part of a wider IRA cell
operating in the area.</i>

02:24.833 --> 02:26.250
Just drive on through, sir.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.083
<i>There's a trick that spies use.</i>

03:07.250 --> 03:09.916
<i>He told me they learn it
on their first day of training.</i>

03:13.333 --> 03:16.166
<i>If you want to make
an instant connection with someone,</i>

03:16.666 --> 03:18.083
<i>look into their eyes,</i>

03:19.041 --> 03:21.666
<i>just long enough
to register their eye color.</i>

03:23.583 --> 03:25.125
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.416
Uh... I'm here about the job.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.041
- Yeah. Come in.
- Thanks.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.125
<i>He said it works every time.</i>

03:43.416 --> 03:45.666
<i>He learned how to hide in plain sight.</i>

03:53.708 --> 03:55.125
<i>How to read people.</i>

03:59.583 --> 04:01.125
-

04:01.125 --> 04:02.125
Thank you!

04:02.125 --> 04:03.458
Thank you so much!

04:05.833 --> 04:08.041
Are you sure I can't buy you a drink?

04:08.708 --> 04:09.958
I don't drink.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.458
Uh...

04:14.541 --> 04:17.333
<i>He learned how to recruit
the right people.</i>

04:19.625 --> 04:20.791
Listen, Ian.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.708
There is something
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.625
You and your friends.

04:27.625 --> 04:28.750
Uh...

04:28.750 --> 04:30.083
Not here, though.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.166
<i>How to persuade them.</i>

04:33.250 --> 04:34.375
You're a spy?

04:35.541 --> 04:38.375
I... I'm an officer
in the British security services.

04:40.041 --> 04:44.083
The IRA cell have been installed
here at Trent Hamilton for over a year.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.750
They are posing as students.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.375
Stealing fertilizer to create bombs.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.666
As you know,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.375
one of them was recently caught
back in Ireland,

04:55.375 --> 04:57.208
trying to blow up a police station.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.875
And the others are still here,
on active service.

05:02.750 --> 05:03.625
Bloody hell.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.541
Can't believe this is happening.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.166
Sorry.

05:09.666 --> 05:10.916
What can we do about it?

05:12.041 --> 05:12.916
Plenty.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.416
Get close to them in ways that I can't.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.958
Find out things
that could really help our investigation.

05:17.958 --> 05:19.041
No.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.791
I'm sorry, no.

05:22.708 --> 05:23.708
Sophie.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.250
Sit down.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Sit.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.750
If you help me do my job,

05:44.750 --> 05:46.875
it will save lives.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.375
I promise you that.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Men.

05:56.541 --> 05:57.541
Women.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.333
Children.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.500
Just read...

06:09.375 --> 06:10.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.833
- Hey.
- How you doing?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.333
- Grand. You?
- Good.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.458
<i>He said
that espionage is storytelling.</i>

06:16.458 --> 06:17.833
<i>Sl√°inte!</i>

06:17.833 --> 06:20.875
<i>And everyone has a story
they want to be told.</i>

06:20.875 --> 06:22.041
Never heard of it.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.541
Tonight is the night.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.291
Tonight, we put into practice
everything I have taught you.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.458
over the last three months.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.625
And remember, this is not a test.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.208
There is no room for failure.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.333
Okay?

06:39.125 --> 06:40.291
Sophie, Mae.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.458
What's your role?

06:44.541 --> 06:45.666
To clear the house.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.416
Get everyone out.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.541
<i>- But there's a moment you have to act.</i>
- Well, listen!

06:51.625 --> 06:54.958
<i>- And that is the moment of maximum risk.</i>
- On that note, I have an announcement.

06:54.958 --> 06:58.833
So I think we should all go
across the road to the Swan,

06:58.833 --> 07:00.791
where I'll buy everyone a round.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.208
- Yes!
-

07:02.208 --> 07:04.208
And that's an offer
we can't refuse. Let's go!

07:04.208 --> 07:05.541
Let's go!

07:05.625 --> 07:06.666
Come on!

07:06.750 --> 07:10.291
<i>In that world, duplicity is a necessity.</i>

07:11.458 --> 07:13.083
Niall, I'm gonna use your toilet.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.041
- Go in the pub.
- Mate, I'm bursting.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.916
- I'll follow you over in a sec.
- Fine. It's upstairs.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.208
- Cool. Ready?
- We ready?

07:20.208 --> 07:21.583
- Let's go, guys!
- Let's go.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.666
- I left my jacket here.
- You're paranoid.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.291
I don't like that, there's no surprise.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.125
- Then I can surprise you.
- Surprise me!

07:37.125 --> 07:38.583
- Nah, I'm not doing that.
- Oh, yeah!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.708
-
- Can you get me a pint of water?

07:43.583 --> 07:46.666
<i>But the greater the ruse,
the bigger the risk.</i>

07:48.750 --> 07:51.208
Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.666
- Doesn't matter. I'm buying.
- I'll just be a minute.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.166
- You can just get it later.
- It's fine, honestly.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.250
Oh, come on.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.250
See you.

08:55.875 --> 08:57.375
You didn't take a shit, did you?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.375
Yeah, there was nothing there.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.208
Thank you.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.375
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

09:22.375 --> 09:25.958
<i>His world was thrilling and mysterious.</i>

09:28.666 --> 09:30.375
<i>But it came at a cost.</i>

09:32.666 --> 09:33.625
Sophie.

09:34.416 --> 09:35.333
Sophie.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.666
Sophie, get up. Get up!

09:37.750 --> 09:39.166
- What?
- We've been compromised.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.833
We're extracting. You need to get up.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.625
- What?
- They know about us.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.833
About you. Okay? They know.

09:46.875 --> 09:47.833
Sophie---No!

09:47.833 --> 09:49.333
You do not have a choice.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.791
They could be here any second.
Get up. Come on.

09:54.541 --> 09:56.541
-

09:59.375 --> 10:00.750
<i>A cost to him...</i>

10:02.125 --> 10:03.458
<i>and to others.</i>

10:05.958 --> 10:07.708
- What happens now?
- I don't know.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.500
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.416
I never had an agent compromised before.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.291
But I promise you, I will protect you.

10:19.458 --> 10:20.875
I will keep you safe.

10:37.583 --> 10:41.416
<i>Anyone who entered that world
left behind the lives they had before.</i>

10:44.083 --> 10:45.708
<i>People they once were.</i>

10:46.833 --> 10:48.916
<i>That was the price they had to pay.</i>

11:12.708 --> 11:13.833
So you have it?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.625
And what does it say?

11:20.083 --> 11:21.125
Perfect.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.875
Oh, yeah. Usual place.

11:25.791 --> 11:27.416
No, she's a beautiful car.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.875
Beautiful. She won't let you down.
She's simple, elegant.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.125
- You've made the right decision.
- Mmm.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.500
Believe me.
It's a whole new world.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.041
Thank you.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.583
So, Andrew, where is she?

11:57.166 --> 11:58.583
You know what the trains are like.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.416
- Come on.
- She travels by train?

12:03.458 --> 12:05.250
Alice, welcome.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.416
Nice of you to join us.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.041
There's been a development.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.916
An email chain
between senior managers at the bank

12:18.833 --> 12:21.041
proving they did indeed
verbally agree with you

12:21.125 --> 12:23.166
to waive the security over the assets.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.583
An agreement
that they not only failed to disclose,

12:26.583 --> 12:29.958
but it now seems,
have actively tried to cover up,

12:30.791 --> 12:33.333
which is potentially criminal
on their part.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.416
Certainly, it blows their case
out of the water.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.125
- How did we...
-

12:42.666 --> 12:43.916
Aaah!

12:44.416 --> 12:46.708
I rather feel a celebration is in order.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.833
I must say, Alice, I'm most impressed.

12:58.833 --> 12:59.916
Thank you.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.333
And you're also not a bad lawyer.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.416
-
- I'm joking! I'm joking!

13:10.041 --> 13:11.166
Sam! More drinks.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.000
- Another bottle of Bollinger.
- Are you okay?

13:21.166 --> 13:22.208
Hi there.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.750
I saw you walking past this morning.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.791
In fact, I see you most mornings.

13:28.875 --> 13:29.750
Oh, fuck off, mate.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.083
-

13:50.083 --> 13:51.250
-

14:04.958 --> 14:07.541
Oh God.

14:44.625 --> 14:45.500
Hi.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.166
- Hi.
- Look.

14:49.916 --> 14:53.416
I wanted to apologize for last night.

14:54.125 --> 14:57.041
- I was rude.
- No, no, it was, uh... it was my fault.

14:57.625 --> 15:01.708
You must get completely fed up with men
coming up and talking to you all the time.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.500
I apologize. It won't happen again.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.166
Okay.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.083
Well,

15:10.333 --> 15:11.333
good.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.625
On a scale of one to ten,
how hungover are you?

15:20.000 --> 15:20.833
Fourteen.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.000
And you're gonna get the Tube
on a hot summer's day like today?

15:26.333 --> 15:28.916
- Hey, I'll give you a lift.
- What?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.208
I'll tell the manager
you want a test drive.

15:31.208 --> 15:34.041
No, no, I-- I really don't think that--

15:34.125 --> 15:35.458
I'll put the roof down.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.041
If you wanna puke,
you can just do it over the side.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.583
- Preferably on a cyclist.
-

15:42.583 --> 15:43.541
Take the BMW.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.666
<i>‚ô™ Beetles and eggs and blues ‚ô™</i>

15:48.750 --> 15:52.875
<i>‚ô™ And pour a little everythin' else ‚ô™</i>

15:54.833 --> 15:58.000
<i>‚ô™ As good news ‚ô™</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:04.041
<i>‚ô™ Still we can find our love
Down from behind ‚ô™</i>

16:08.708 --> 16:15.041
<i>‚ô™ Down from behind this fabulous
My turn rules ‚ô™</i>

16:17.000 --> 16:18.083
Thanks.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.375
My card.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.625
In case you wanna buy a car.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.125
Or have dinner.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.541
Robert Hansen.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.416
Look, um...

16:41.416 --> 16:45.416
I'm not trying to be an arsehole here,
but I should put my cards on the table.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.708
I, uh... I don't usually--

16:47.708 --> 16:50.500
You don't usually date guys
who sell cars for a living.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.916
Have you had bad experiences
with car salesmen before?

17:00.416 --> 17:01.708
Okay.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.541
Well, top marks for persistence.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.041
Tomorrow night works for me.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.416
- Pick you up at eight?
- You don't know where I live.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.583
A couple of doors down from the showroom.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.041
You own a blue Mercedes.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.375
It's not a bad car, that.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.791
See you, tomorrow, Alice.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.791
<i>‚ô™ At least you know
But either way ‚ô™</i>

17:40.875 --> 17:45.458
<i>‚ô™ I wanna call but you're so far away... ‚ô™</i>

17:50.000 --> 17:53.083
<i>‚ô™ Come on and say, somebody said ‚ô™</i>

17:53.083 --> 17:56.875
<i>‚ô™ You're not helping
You're so far away... ‚ô™</i>

18:21.625 --> 18:22.916
Prick.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.083
It's really a question
of loan-to-value ratio

18:25.083 --> 18:27.791
and whether we can roll
the wider assets into the case.

18:27.875 --> 18:31.333
In my view, because the holding company
is named in the contract, we can.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.916
If anybody disagrees, I'm all ears.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.125
Alice?

18:38.541 --> 18:40.083
-
- We good?

18:40.708 --> 18:41.583
Yeah.

18:42.916 --> 18:44.750
All right. You know what to do.

18:58.291 --> 18:59.708
Don't think so, mate.

18:59.708 --> 19:00.958
Fuckin' idiot.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.708
- Yeah?
- <i>I'm so sorry about last night.</i>

19:16.708 --> 19:19.250
Okay, well, you don't get
a second chance, I'm afraid.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.208
- Don't contact me again. <i>- My dad was taken to hospital.</i>

19:23.041 --> 19:24.083
Your dad?

19:24.083 --> 19:25.458
<i>That's why I couldn't call.</i>

19:25.458 --> 19:28.041
<i>I was by his bedside all night.
They don't allow phones.</i>

19:28.125 --> 19:30.291
<i>I'm-- I'm so sorry, I really am.</i>

19:30.916 --> 19:32.166
Is he okay?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.125
<i>Uh...</i>

19:34.125 --> 19:36.333
<i>Yeah, yeah, I think so.</i>

19:36.333 --> 19:39.000
<i>Uh, it was a bit of difficult evening,
to be honest.</i>

19:40.083 --> 19:41.000
Oh.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.125
Okay.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.750
<i>Listen, I'm, uh... I'm outside.</i>

19:47.791 --> 19:49.083
You're outside?

19:49.750 --> 19:50.875
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

19:52.458 --> 19:53.708
Can I come in?

19:53.708 --> 19:56.333
No, you can't come in.
I don't even know you.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.250
Oh, yeah. Um... Of course. Well...

20:01.083 --> 20:03.708
<i>Well, look, can I leave this
by the doorstep?</i>

20:04.291 --> 20:07.500
<i>It's a present I got you
to say sorry about last night.</i>

20:09.083 --> 20:10.875
Bollocks. Okay.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.000
Mmm!

20:25.166 --> 20:26.541
It's delicious. Thank you.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.583
No, um... it was only really enough for one.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.208
It was great.

20:34.708 --> 20:35.708
Really great.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.791
Uh, are you sure you won't have...

20:40.875 --> 20:42.000
No, I don't drink.

20:42.666 --> 20:43.708
Oh.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.833
Did you stop or...

20:47.666 --> 20:49.500
I just never really started.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.083
Mmm.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.166
So, do you like it?

21:01.583 --> 21:02.500
It's...

21:03.583 --> 21:05.458
it's unique, isn't it?

21:08.291 --> 21:09.791
I like its eyes.

21:13.958 --> 21:16.208
So, where are you from, originally?

21:16.791 --> 21:17.791
Um...

21:18.708 --> 21:20.958
Well, the north of England, and then, um...

21:21.541 --> 21:23.958
Catterick, Aldershot, then Belfast.

21:23.958 --> 21:25.708
- Everywhere and nowhere, really.
-

21:25.708 --> 21:29.125
My dad was in the military,
so we moved every two or three years.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.750
That must have been difficult.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.791
You sort of get used to it, I guess.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.416
And you weren't tempted
by the military life yourself?

21:37.500 --> 21:38.791
No, God no.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.458
No, at the end of the day,

21:41.458 --> 21:43.541
put on a uniform,
you gotta be prepared to...

21:44.666 --> 21:47.666
pull the trigger and end someone's life.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.541
- I just don't think I could do that.
- Really?

21:51.791 --> 21:53.166
- Yeah.
-

21:57.000 --> 21:59.208
So you sell cars instead?

22:00.083 --> 22:01.291
I sell luxury cars.

22:01.375 --> 22:04.416
- Right. There's a difference, is there?
- Oh, a huge difference.

22:05.375 --> 22:09.166
If someone wants a luxury car,
they're looking for an idea of themselves.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.458
- They're searching for a dream.
- Hmm.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.166
If you think about it,
it's actually quite moving.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.916
Well, I've met plenty
of barroom philosophers,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.625
but you're the first showroom philosopher.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.583
What about you? Do you like what you do?

22:31.583 --> 22:33.041
Mmm...

22:34.875 --> 22:36.500
Um... "Like..."

22:37.875 --> 22:39.541
is a pretty strong word.

22:40.875 --> 22:41.958
So why do you do it?

22:42.458 --> 22:44.416
Well, uh...

22:46.458 --> 22:47.458
I mean...

22:50.958 --> 22:53.583
it's... it's my job, you know?

23:02.375 --> 23:05.625
Well, thank you for dinner.
That was really... really lovely.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.208
Oh-- Yeah, yeah, well...

23:08.250 --> 23:10.541
- Uh...
- And sorry again about last night.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.875
No, it's-- it's fine, honestly.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.541
Uh... uh...

23:14.625 --> 23:15.833
Oh. Um...

23:16.541 --> 23:18.583
Uh, I hope your dad recovers quickly.

23:19.625 --> 23:20.958
Yeah. Thank you.

23:22.583 --> 23:23.916
-
- Um...

23:28.208 --> 23:30.375
Oh, yeah.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.708
Take care, Alice.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.125
What the fuck?

23:54.208 --> 23:57.000
The file on the latest
Jeremy Ascott litigation.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.250
Hello.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.541
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

24:12.625 --> 24:13.750
What, <i>now</i> now?

24:14.416 --> 24:15.833
I'm working.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.625
<i>I'd like to show you something.</i>

24:19.000 --> 24:21.083
- What? <i>- It's a surprise.</i>

24:22.375 --> 24:24.625
- Where are we going?
- Be patient.

24:24.625 --> 24:27.875
- Is this it?
- So full of questions. Trust me!

24:28.500 --> 24:31.166
- Two, please.
- All right. Ten pounds.

24:32.583 --> 24:33.583
- Thank you.
- What is this?

24:33.583 --> 24:35.083
- Thank you.
- Come on.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.208
Come on.

24:39.041 --> 24:40.166
- Uh--
- Oh.

24:40.666 --> 24:42.416
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

24:52.416 --> 24:53.666
What is it?

24:54.250 --> 24:55.708
It's called <i>Longplayer.</i>

24:58.083 --> 24:59.708
These are Tibetan music bowls.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.125
They're playing a composition
that lasts for 1,000 years

25:03.125 --> 25:05.000
without ever repeating itself.

25:06.583 --> 25:08.375
It's controlled by a computer,

25:09.208 --> 25:11.375
and it never, ever stops.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.083
The plan is...

25:15.625 --> 25:18.791
to just let it keep playing
without stopping.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.750
Maybe, hopefully, for a thousand years.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.791
You are...

25:27.750 --> 25:30.375
so fucking random.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.041
Do you not like it?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.166
I do like it.

25:38.125 --> 25:40.083
I've never seen anything like it.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.500
Listen to that.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.666
Hey, come with me.

25:56.791 --> 25:58.208
Okay.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.791
- Seriously, come on.
- All right.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.166
I love lighthouses.

26:17.416 --> 26:19.208
Wow.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.583
-

26:23.583 --> 26:27.000
This lighthouse was here
way before any of those skyscrapers were,

26:28.333 --> 26:31.000
and it'll probably be here
long after they're gone.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.708
You think so?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.000
Yeah. I hope so.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.750
Sophie?

27:59.208 --> 28:00.208
Okay.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.750
Right, I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.458
-

28:09.416 --> 28:10.333
Uh, it's my dad.

28:11.541 --> 28:12.791
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

28:12.875 --> 28:14.250
- Great.
- Great.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh!

28:25.958 --> 28:27.291
Just a standard check?

28:27.916 --> 28:29.708
Credit histories, mortgages,

28:29.708 --> 28:31.166
and spouses?

28:33.583 --> 28:35.791
- Thank you.
- I'll be in touch.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.041
-
- Hello, Sophie.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.250
Rob.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.875
Supply run.

29:58.958 --> 30:00.041
How's it going?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.416
Oh, well, um...

30:03.583 --> 30:06.291
I have the guest logs
for the last two weeks.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.000
I can't find a pattern.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.666
Nothing's standing out to me.

30:23.916 --> 30:25.875
I'll get the analysts to take a look.

30:30.041 --> 30:30.875
Well done.

30:33.291 --> 30:36.750
Oh. I got you some, uh... some proper grub.

30:38.625 --> 30:39.833
Spaghetti

30:41.375 --> 30:42.333
and...

30:43.416 --> 30:44.416
bolognese.

30:47.291 --> 30:48.291
Thank you.

30:49.625 --> 30:51.500
No credit history at all?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.541
<i>Nothing.
And no marriage certificate.</i>

30:55.166 --> 30:58.125
<i>In terms of public records,
Robert Hansen is a ghost.</i>

30:58.958 --> 31:00.958
And what does that tell you?

31:01.833 --> 31:02.833
<i>Nothing good.</i>

31:04.791 --> 31:06.875
Okay. Thank you.

31:10.166 --> 31:11.708
Ooh, I think this is us.

31:12.208 --> 31:13.166
Great.

31:13.666 --> 31:17.083
How was work? I didn't see you
when I passed this morning.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.166
Thank you.

31:20.625 --> 31:21.625
Thanks.

31:22.291 --> 31:23.625
Um...

31:23.625 --> 31:27.333
Work... Uh, yeah,
I guess I was on a-- on a test drive.

31:29.416 --> 31:31.375
- Sell many cars?
- Two.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.583
Not a bad day at the office.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.500
How about you?

31:40.375 --> 31:41.375
The usual.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.291
How's your dad?

31:55.416 --> 31:57.083
He's better, thank you. Yeah.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.333
He, um... he came home, which is great.
Such a relief.

32:01.625 --> 32:02.625
Yeah.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.458
Everything all right?

32:17.416 --> 32:18.625
Everything's great.

32:23.541 --> 32:24.541
Give me a chip.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.125
- One. No more.
-

32:40.333 --> 32:41.833
You're not sure about me.

32:42.583 --> 32:43.583
What?

32:44.125 --> 32:46.250
You have reservations.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.500
Questions.

32:51.041 --> 32:52.375
I had you checked out.

32:53.958 --> 32:54.958
You did what?

32:54.958 --> 32:57.083
You know I'm a litigation solicitor.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.375
We have people
who do client checks for us.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.166
Credit history. That sort of thing.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.541
Sorry, you put
a private investigator onto me?

33:08.625 --> 33:10.041
Yes, I did.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.958
And as far as he can see, you don't exist.

33:15.208 --> 33:16.583
- Right.
- Yeah.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.500
- Impressive.
- Yeah, isn't it?

33:23.666 --> 33:24.666
Well...

33:25.708 --> 33:26.708
technically,

33:28.333 --> 33:29.416
that's right.

33:30.166 --> 33:31.083
I don't exist.

33:32.958 --> 33:36.583
Or rather, the name that
you have been searching for doesn't exist.

33:39.333 --> 33:43.041
Alice, Robert Hansen is an alias.

33:44.625 --> 33:46.750
My real name is Robert Freegard.

33:48.583 --> 33:50.541
- Alice, wait.
- Get the fuck off me.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.125
Wait. Jesus, give me a second.

33:52.125 --> 33:55.083
- You're married, aren't you?
- No, I'm not married.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.500
-
- Alice, please.

34:04.791 --> 34:08.666
I am an officer
in the British security services.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.083
MI5.

34:17.916 --> 34:21.125
- You work in a car showroom.
- That's my cover right now.

34:21.125 --> 34:25.250
- I can't tell you any more than that.
- What? Come on.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.666
No, I'm sorry, no. Bullshit.

34:27.750 --> 34:30.250
- It's the truth.
- Well, then, who's Sophie?

34:33.250 --> 34:34.625
How do you know about her?

34:35.125 --> 34:37.625
She rang your phone
when you were in the shower.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.250
She works with me.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.833
I supervise her on a job.

34:45.541 --> 34:49.791
She's undercover as well, like me, okay?
We're on the same investigation.

34:51.041 --> 34:54.041
Alice, listen, I know this is a shock,
but it's the truth.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.833
I-- I just...

35:00.666 --> 35:01.500
A spy?

35:06.000 --> 35:10.416
No. You-- you told me...
You said that you could never kill anyone.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.333
I don't think I could.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.458
I-- I never have, either.

35:20.541 --> 35:24.125
- Do you have a gun?
- No, it's not like the movies.

35:30.833 --> 35:35.416
Listen, now that I've told you all this,
I have to let my superiors know, okay?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.916
Means you're gonna be vetted.

35:37.583 --> 35:38.458
Vetted?

35:38.458 --> 35:41.916
It just means they're gonna do
some basic inquiries into your life.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.875
It's a pain in the arse,
but it won't take long.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.583
All long-term partners have to be vetted.

36:18.166 --> 36:21.875
<i>‚ô™ "Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick" ‚ô™</i>

36:21.875 --> 36:25.041
<i>‚ô™ "The one that makes me scream"
She said ‚ô™</i>

36:25.125 --> 36:27.708
<i>‚ô™ "The one that makes me laugh" she said ‚ô™</i>

36:28.583 --> 36:31.333
<i>‚ô™ And threw her arms around my neck ‚ô™</i>

36:31.333 --> 36:34.083
<i>‚ô™ Show me how you do it ‚ô™</i>

36:34.083 --> 36:36.250
<i>-‚ô™ And I'll promise you... ‚ô™
- </i> Where did you get this?

36:36.250 --> 36:39.291
<i>-‚ô™ I promise that I'll run away with you ‚ô™</i>
- Borrowed it from the showroom.

36:39.375 --> 36:42.291
They lease it to men
who are trying to impress beautiful women.

36:44.625 --> 36:45.833
Oh my God.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.916
- It's true.
-

36:54.416 --> 36:55.791
What are you doing?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.750
Right.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.583
- Your turn.
- What?

37:03.083 --> 37:04.666
- No. Oh, no.
- What?

37:04.750 --> 37:05.708
You can't drive?

37:05.708 --> 37:08.500
- I-- I can drive.
- Well, then.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.041
- Really?
- Really.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.416
- Come on.
- All right, fine.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.041
Shit!

37:17.750 --> 37:19.875
Oh my God.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.458
This is insane.

37:22.666 --> 37:24.375
- Aah!
- What am I doing?

37:25.708 --> 37:27.666
- You have to teach me.
- I'll teach you.

37:28.791 --> 37:31.000
- How does it feel?
- Good.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.625
- Nervous?
- Yes.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.750
You can go a bit faster.

37:37.666 --> 37:41.041
- We're already at 70.
- Yeah, exactly. Put your foot down.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.625
<i>-‚ô™ "Why are you so far away..." ‚ô™</i>
- Go on, put your foot down.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.166
- Okay.
- Go on.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.166
- Oh, shit!
-

37:48.833 --> 37:49.708
Come on!

37:49.708 --> 37:51.791
<i>-‚ô™ That I'm in love with you... ‚ô™</i>
-

37:53.500 --> 37:55.625
- Oh my God!
- Whoo!

37:55.625 --> 37:57.375
Yeah! The car's made to go fast.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.708
Oh my God!
<i>‚ô™ You, lost and lonely ‚ô™</i>

37:59.708 --> 38:02.833
<i>‚ô™ You, strange as angels ‚ô™</i>

38:02.833 --> 38:06.083
<i>‚ô™ Dancing in the deepest ocean ‚ô™</i>

38:06.083 --> 38:07.875
<i>-‚ô™ Twisting in the water... ‚ô™</i>
- Go for it!

38:07.875 --> 38:10.625
- Go on! Go on!
- Oh my God!

38:11.791 --> 38:13.500
<i>‚ô™ You're just like a dream ‚ô™</i>

38:20.458 --> 38:23.000
Oh my God!

38:23.583 --> 38:25.500
- Look at this place!
-

38:27.375 --> 38:28.791
It's ours for the weekend.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.833
- Not bad, eh?
- I love it.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.750
It's amazing.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.250
You're amazing.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.833
-

38:38.416 --> 38:39.666
Whoo!

38:40.208 --> 38:41.458
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

38:41.458 --> 38:44.291
<i>‚ô™ Well, I guess it would be nice ‚ô™</i>

38:44.375 --> 38:46.625
<i>‚ô™ If I could touch your body ‚ô™</i>

38:46.625 --> 38:48.958
<i>‚ô™ I know not everybody ‚ô™</i>

38:48.958 --> 38:50.958
<i>-‚ô™ Has got a body like you... ‚ô™</i>
- Wow.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.416
<i>‚ô™ Oh, but I gotta think twice ‚ô™</i>

38:54.416 --> 38:56.833
<i>-‚ô™ Before I give my heart away... ‚ô™</i>
-

38:56.833 --> 38:58.958
<i>‚ô™ And I know all the games you play ‚ô™</i>

38:58.958 --> 39:00.791
<i>‚ô™ 'Cause I play them too ‚ô™</i>

39:01.458 --> 39:04.916
<i>‚ô™ Oh, but I need some time off ‚ô™</i>

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
<i>‚ô™ From that emotion ‚ô™</i>

39:07.708 --> 39:10.750
<i>‚ô™ Time to pick my heart up
Off the floor... ‚ô™</i>

39:10.750 --> 39:14.708
- <i>-‚ô™ Oh, when that love comes down with ‚ô™</i>

39:14.708 --> 39:16.625
You're so distracting.

39:16.625 --> 39:19.250
How can you possibly be working?
Look at this place.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.833
I'm starting to fall behind

39:20.833 --> 39:23.541
because someone
won't stop texting me in the office.

39:23.625 --> 39:24.541
- Oh.
- Mmm.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.250
- Stop it.
-

39:33.416 --> 39:35.333
Have you thought
about doing anything else?

39:36.458 --> 39:37.750
What do you mean?

39:37.750 --> 39:40.416
I mean, if you weren't a lawyer,
what would you be?

39:41.500 --> 39:42.916
I dunno. Um...

39:44.041 --> 39:45.791
My own boss, ideally.

39:46.666 --> 39:49.291
- Oh, like an entrepreneur?
- It's silly.

39:50.541 --> 39:51.625
No, it's not.

39:55.833 --> 39:56.916
What about kids?

39:58.166 --> 39:59.166
Kids?

39:59.958 --> 40:01.458
You wanna have kids?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Do you?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.000
- Yeah.
-

40:07.416 --> 40:10.416
Five years' time, I wanna be running
my own business, with a kid.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.500
Maybe two.

40:12.916 --> 40:14.500
So you'd leave the service?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.041
Mmm... Not straightaway.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.625
But I think I've done my bit.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.625
It's time for a change.

40:23.875 --> 40:25.208
What kind of business?

40:25.750 --> 40:26.916
Car leasing.

40:27.583 --> 40:28.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.125
- Car leasing?
- Yeah, the rich don't buy cars anymore.

40:32.708 --> 40:34.375
They do it on short-term rentals.

40:34.375 --> 40:36.791
That way, when they get bored,
they can move on.

40:36.875 --> 40:40.333
promise you, there is
a fortune to be made leasing cars.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.916
- Look at you and all your plans.
- Mmm.

40:45.625 --> 40:47.833
- Hey, a man has gotta have a plan.
- A man does.

40:47.833 --> 40:49.416
- A man does.
- A man does.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.791
God, you're so beautiful.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.416
- Oh! Piss off!
- Mmm!

40:56.500 --> 40:57.666
- Do you know what?
- No

40:57.750 --> 40:59.916
- Goodbye!
- No!

41:01.625 --> 41:03.958
So, Robert, you're a brave man

41:03.958 --> 41:06.500
if you're willing to do battle
with our Alice on a daily basis.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.041
- Oh, hilarious.
-

41:09.125 --> 41:11.541
I, uh... I think
I've got the measure of her.

41:15.583 --> 41:18.250
So, how is the motor business these days?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.250
You know, it couldn't be better.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.791
It'll all end in tears.
You mark my words.

41:23.458 --> 41:25.875
- Too much debt around.
- I don't know about that.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.541
Make hay while the sun shines,
as they say.

41:31.166 --> 41:32.458
Thank you.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.666
And what are your plans
for the future?

41:37.750 --> 41:40.125
- Mum!
- We're not asking him to marry you, Al.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.916
We're just asking what his plans are.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.166
- Dad!
- It's okay.

41:43.875 --> 41:46.791
Uh, well, Madeleine, my plans are, um...

41:47.958 --> 41:49.958
my plans are to make the most of things.

41:49.958 --> 41:51.041
Right.

41:51.708 --> 41:55.750
Actually, Alice and I are thinking
about starting a little business together.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.666
Leasing cars.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.541
What? No, Alice is a lawyer.
She's a bloody good one.

42:04.625 --> 42:07.916
I'm not leaving my job, Dad.
It's just a side project.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.333
Side project?

42:09.333 --> 42:12.708
You're an entrepreneur, aren't you,
Richard? You can't blame us for trying.

42:12.708 --> 42:16.625
Everyone always wants more
than what's in front of them, don't they?

42:17.125 --> 42:21.083
You know, I don't think it is about
wanting more, at least not materially.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.125
What is it about, then?

42:25.291 --> 42:26.500
Oh, it's about...

42:28.250 --> 42:29.625
Oh, it's about freedom.

42:35.666 --> 42:38.291
-
- Oh my God!

42:38.375 --> 42:40.375
- They hated me.
-

42:40.375 --> 42:42.541
No, my mum liked you.

42:43.166 --> 42:44.958
But, yeah, Dad hated you.

42:45.541 --> 42:48.625
- Yeah. I talk too much.
- So does he.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.625
- Two bloody stags in a clearing.
- Yeah.

42:53.125 --> 42:55.833
- My antlers are bigger than his, though.
-

42:56.583 --> 42:59.666
Maybe he is right
about the business.

43:01.375 --> 43:04.333
Maybe we should just stay in our lane, eh?

43:04.958 --> 43:05.958
No!

43:06.750 --> 43:07.875
We should do it.

43:08.833 --> 43:09.833
We should.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:11.750 --> 43:13.000
-
- Oh!

43:13.583 --> 43:17.291
- Aah! Okay, we're doing it.
- Yeah. Don't listen to my dad.

43:32.166 --> 43:34.333
- It's time to move on.
- Now?

43:34.333 --> 43:35.500
Now.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.625
- What about my stuff?
- Leave it.

43:39.833 --> 43:41.333
Have we been compromised?

43:41.333 --> 43:43.291
- I was so careful.
- No.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.583
No, you, uh...

43:48.250 --> 43:49.583
you got the place.

43:51.333 --> 43:54.000
- On the field officer training program.
- What?

43:54.708 --> 43:57.416
- You've been selected.
- What?

43:57.500 --> 43:58.791
-

43:59.291 --> 44:02.500
- Oh my God.
- Your days of being a freelancer are over.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.791
Now, listen.
It doesn't start for a little while.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.916
I'll find you
somewhere to stay until then.

44:11.208 --> 44:12.833
-

44:16.833 --> 44:18.416
Hey. Come on.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.958
Sorry.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.208
Congratulations, Sophie.

44:23.916 --> 44:26.458
- Nobody deserves this more than you.
-

44:29.125 --> 44:30.791
Oh my God.

44:31.875 --> 44:33.125
Come on. Let's go.

44:33.125 --> 44:34.916
-

44:43.458 --> 44:46.416
- I didn't wanna talk over the phone.
- Okay.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.875
This guy you asked me
to check out, the ghost.

44:50.541 --> 44:52.666
Oh, yeah. No, that's all been resolved.

44:53.541 --> 44:56.125
Oh. Well, I managed to do
a little bit more digging.

45:00.416 --> 45:01.458
Go on.

45:02.333 --> 45:05.791
So, we know Robert Hansen
doesn't exist, not officially.

45:05.875 --> 45:07.583
But I did find, in the court records,

45:07.583 --> 45:11.125
a couple of minor judgments
against a Robert Hansen-Freegard.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.458
Nothing serious, mind you, but, well,

45:15.250 --> 45:18.250
I like to do a thorough job,
so I ran all the iterations.

45:18.250 --> 45:19.250
Robert Hansen,

45:20.291 --> 45:23.958
Robert Hansen-Freegard,
and Robert Freegard.

45:25.208 --> 45:26.375
Court documents?

45:26.958 --> 45:28.541
Sealed court documents, no less.

45:29.041 --> 45:31.625
They're relating to someone
called Robert Freegard.

45:31.625 --> 45:34.125
Date of birth, May 21st, 1967.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.750
1991, he had a brush with the court.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.833
Up in front of a judge, on the receiving
end of a non-molestation order.

45:42.208 --> 45:44.875
A few years later,
he successfully had that set aside.

45:45.375 --> 45:46.708
Or somebody did.

45:47.333 --> 45:48.833
Wh-- what was it about?

45:49.458 --> 45:52.833
The allegation was for stalking
and harassment of a young woman.

45:52.833 --> 45:56.541
Julie Harper. Wouldn't leave her alone.
Made her life hell, it seems.

45:56.625 --> 45:59.375
I couldn't find the girl,
but I managed to get a phone number

45:59.375 --> 46:02.375
for a Bridget Harper,
who I'm pretty sure is her mother.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.166
Anything else?

46:06.875 --> 46:07.875
No.

46:08.958 --> 46:09.958
No, thank you.

46:32.750 --> 46:34.625
- How was work?
- Good. Good

46:38.833 --> 46:40.000
Is everything okay?

46:40.666 --> 46:41.666
Great.

46:47.208 --> 46:49.416
Have you heard from my employers yet?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.916
- Your employers?
- Yeah.

46:52.791 --> 46:55.291
They haven't tried
to shit-test you, have they?

46:55.791 --> 46:56.958
"Shit-test"?

46:56.958 --> 47:00.000
Throw some crap at you.
Something unexpected.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.583
See if it sticks.

47:02.458 --> 47:04.750
It helps them draw up
a psych profile of you.

47:05.375 --> 47:06.708
What do you mean, throw some crap?

47:06.708 --> 47:08.625
Pfft. I don't know.
They can be pretty creative.

47:09.333 --> 47:13.125
They don't always do it,
so, uh... forget I said anything.

47:13.125 --> 47:16.375
No, um... I mean, what-- what kind of crap?

47:17.708 --> 47:19.083
Um...

47:19.083 --> 47:20.750
I don't know. Some bullshit about me.

47:21.333 --> 47:24.583
Something to throw you off guard.
Test your loyalty to me.

47:26.750 --> 47:28.958
Honestly,
they probably won't do it.

47:28.958 --> 47:32.458
And even if they did,
I know that you would handle it perfectly,

47:32.458 --> 47:34.958
so forget I said it.

47:36.916 --> 47:38.666
Ready. Here we go.

47:41.125 --> 47:43.000
- Try this.
- Mmm!

47:45.958 --> 47:48.375
There was actually one more thing
I wanted to say to you.

47:48.875 --> 47:51.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Um...

47:55.500 --> 47:56.500
I love you.

48:03.541 --> 48:04.666
Right, let's eat.

48:06.375 --> 48:10.000
This is the best bolognese
that you have ever eaten.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.250
I promise you that.

48:14.916 --> 48:15.791
Mmm.

48:27.916 --> 48:29.083
Uh

48:41.083 --> 48:42.583
Okay, then. Shit-test me.

48:42.583 --> 48:44.500
-

48:52.000 --> 48:55.541
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello. Mrs. Harper?

48:55.625 --> 48:57.416
<i>That's right. How can I help you?</i>

48:57.500 --> 48:59.541
Hi, uh, my name's Alice Archer.

49:00.125 --> 49:01.625
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh--

49:02.125 --> 49:05.208
I need to talk to you
about someone your daughter used to know.

49:06.416 --> 49:08.208
His name is Robert Freegard.

49:13.625 --> 49:14.958
Mrs. Harper?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.250
Hey, babe.

49:22.041 --> 49:24.541
Ooh, you look incredible.

49:26.333 --> 49:27.458
This is nice.

49:28.833 --> 49:31.333
I was speaking to someone
that used to know you today.

49:31.833 --> 49:34.333
She told me the most extraordinary story.

49:35.708 --> 49:36.583
Oh?

49:36.583 --> 49:37.791
Bridget Harper.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.583
Mother of Julie Harper?

49:41.000 --> 49:45.125
She told me that, years ago,
you and Julie had a whirlwind romance.

49:45.875 --> 49:49.666
She borrowed 20 grand off her parents
to get married, but it never happened.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.708
- I did tell you this was gonna happen.
- Oh, fuck off.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.291
There was a court case. You harassed her.

50:00.291 --> 50:03.375
- Are you telling me this is all made up?
- Not all of it, no.

50:04.083 --> 50:05.125
Ahem...

50:11.000 --> 50:12.458
Julie was my first girlfriend.

50:13.666 --> 50:15.958
Thought I loved her.
Maybe I did. I don't know.

50:17.333 --> 50:19.833
Uh... She drank, a lot.

50:20.333 --> 50:23.500
At first, I excused it,
thought it was normal, but it wasn't.

50:24.666 --> 50:27.625
She was, uh... she was an alcoholic. It was...

50:29.583 --> 50:32.708
It was horrible. She's actually
the reason I gave up drinking.

50:34.583 --> 50:36.791
Eventually, I persuaded her
to go into rehab.

50:36.875 --> 50:39.916
We found a place.
It was private, expensive.

50:41.250 --> 50:45.166
She borrowed the money off her parents,
but she never told them why she needed it.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.833
Then the night before she was meant to go,
she just disappeared.

50:49.833 --> 50:52.666
I guess she really didn't want
to give up drinking.

50:53.958 --> 50:55.791
I tried to find her, of course I did.

50:56.583 --> 50:57.541
And yeah.

50:58.791 --> 51:01.208
Yeah, she complained to the police
to keep me away.

51:02.166 --> 51:03.541
I went to court.

51:03.625 --> 51:06.583
Judge threw it out
in about five minutes flat.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.750
This came out in my clearance interviews
when I applied for the service.

51:12.750 --> 51:14.041
That's why it's coming up.

51:14.125 --> 51:16.291
They use this
when they do this kind of thing.

51:16.375 --> 51:19.208
- But the woman I spoke to--
- Is Bridget, and, yes, she's real.

51:19.208 --> 51:23.000
This is what she really thinks.
I can't change her mind. No one will.

51:23.583 --> 51:26.833
Oh, and by the way, the person
who gave you all this information?

51:26.833 --> 51:30.125
They're working for us.
I imagine, as a freelancer.

51:31.666 --> 51:32.666
But why?

51:33.708 --> 51:37.416
- I mean, why?
- To see if you'll trust me in a crisis.

51:47.625 --> 51:48.875
Where are you going?

51:50.500 --> 51:54.125
Uh, I'm gonna work out
if I wanna spend the rest of my life

51:54.833 --> 51:58.958
with someone whose job has turned them
into a cynical, entitled bitch.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.166
Hello?

52:21.250 --> 52:23.541
<i>Hello. Is this Alice Archer?</i>

52:24.375 --> 52:25.375
Yes.

52:26.416 --> 52:29.500
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, but I was given
your number earlier today</i>

52:29.500 --> 52:30.708
<i>by Bridget Harper.</i>

52:32.208 --> 52:35.000
<i>I'm calling
in relation to Robert Freegard.</i>

52:35.666 --> 52:36.666
Who is this?

52:36.750 --> 52:38.750
<i>My name is Paul Jones.</i>

52:39.750 --> 52:41.208
<i>Robert Freegard has...</i>

52:41.833 --> 52:45.500
<i>well, he has kidnapped
my daughter, Sophie.</i>

52:45.500 --> 52:48.000
I'm sorry, but you need to stop this now.

52:48.583 --> 52:53.333
This is an infringement of my privacy
and that of my partner. This is obscene.

53:39.708 --> 53:41.750
That's just before
she went to college.

53:42.250 --> 53:44.041
Before it all happened.

53:47.041 --> 53:49.958
And so she just disappeared?

53:52.208 --> 53:55.791
Her, another girl,
and a young man called Ian Preston.

53:55.875 --> 53:58.000
His people are from Burley Vale.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.291
He came home, eventually.

54:04.750 --> 54:06.083
Sophie didn't.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.791
Obviously, we involved the police.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.208
After a few days, she called.

54:14.208 --> 54:15.833
She said that she was safe,

54:15.833 --> 54:19.958
that they were doing something important,
and that they would be gone for some time.

54:21.708 --> 54:23.708
The police lost interest after that.

54:24.750 --> 54:26.750
So why do you say she was kidnapped?

54:27.250 --> 54:29.708
Do you think
she was making the call under duress?

54:30.375 --> 54:33.375
Not duress exactly. More like...

54:34.208 --> 54:35.125
More like what?

54:37.125 --> 54:38.166
He brainwashed her.

54:45.041 --> 54:47.000
- Where are we?
- One last mission.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.791
- But I thought--
- Hey.

54:49.666 --> 54:50.666
No questions.

54:57.375 --> 54:59.166
Of course I tried to find them.

54:59.708 --> 55:03.083
I traced her credit card withdrawals
all over the country.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.083
But I was always two steps behind.

55:06.875 --> 55:09.041
I thought,
if only I could see her face-to-face,

55:09.125 --> 55:11.416
I could jolt her out of this madness,

55:11.500 --> 55:12.666
but I never could.

55:13.833 --> 55:16.250
It was a phone call here, a letter there.

55:17.500 --> 55:21.166
Never asking how we were.
Never saying she missed us.

55:21.250 --> 55:23.791
- Just only ever asking for money.
- Money?

55:23.875 --> 55:25.333
That's all she ever wanted.

55:26.333 --> 55:30.083
In the end, she asked for her share
of the inheritance. She wanted it now.

55:31.208 --> 55:32.458
Before we died.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.166
And did you give her the money?

55:39.333 --> 55:41.250
Yes.

55:41.250 --> 55:43.708
I realize now
it was the wrong thing to do.

55:45.916 --> 55:48.125
How much did you end up giving her?

55:51.083 --> 55:52.708
About ¬£300,000.

56:38.875 --> 56:42.000
If there's any way
you could get him to lead you to her,

56:42.000 --> 56:43.416
any way at all...

56:44.291 --> 56:45.750
Ah... I mean, I...

56:46.416 --> 56:48.041
I don't really...

56:48.125 --> 56:50.583
- How?
- You're still close to him.

56:51.375 --> 56:53.583
If you could keep it that way
a while longer,

56:53.583 --> 56:55.833
maybe he could tell you where she is.

56:55.833 --> 56:58.333
Find something out, anything.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.291
I, uh-- I can't promise anything.

57:00.958 --> 57:02.875
I've got so much to think about.

57:06.250 --> 57:07.208
Thank you.

57:08.458 --> 57:09.458
And...

57:10.333 --> 57:11.375
I'm sorry.

57:13.958 --> 57:17.166
Do you believe in God, Miss Archer?

57:17.250 --> 57:18.750
And the devil?

57:21.375 --> 57:23.541
I, uh... I don't really think about it.

57:23.625 --> 57:24.708
Well, I do.

57:26.250 --> 57:29.083
I believe that some people
have been put on this Earth

57:29.083 --> 57:31.000
to be the agents of one or the other.

57:31.666 --> 57:33.625
Robert Freegard is such an agent,

57:34.708 --> 57:36.125
and he's not the Lord's.

58:03.125 --> 58:04.541
Alice Archer.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.583
Alice Archer.

58:25.375 --> 58:26.458
Oh.

58:27.500 --> 58:28.916
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:35.375 --> 58:37.916
I called you at work today.
They said you were out.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I was.

58:40.041 --> 58:41.583
- Where were you?
-

58:42.083 --> 58:43.583
I was at a meeting.

59:00.958 --> 59:02.125
We need to talk.

59:09.958 --> 59:11.083
I'm sorry.

59:12.791 --> 59:13.875
What for?

59:14.833 --> 59:16.250
Sorry I doubted you.

59:17.791 --> 59:18.916
I had a choice.

59:19.958 --> 59:23.666
To believe you, to put my faith in you,
or to let you down.

59:24.958 --> 59:26.416
And I let you down.

59:29.333 --> 59:30.666
It won't happen again.

59:32.041 --> 59:33.250
I love you.

59:44.291 --> 59:45.625
I'm here for you.

59:47.625 --> 59:48.625
Always.

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:18.958
- Why are we doing this?
- It's need-to-know.

1:00:21.333 --> 1:00:22.791
Oh God, I don't think I can.

1:00:22.875 --> 1:00:25.500
You do not question me
in the middle of a mission.

1:00:30.708 --> 1:00:33.791
Can't decide
whether to buy them or sue them.

1:00:34.375 --> 1:00:36.583
-
- What do we think? A takeover?

1:00:37.208 --> 1:00:40.416
Or do we go to war with them?
Just crush them in litigation?

1:00:42.916 --> 1:00:45.541
- Alice? What course of action?
-

1:00:48.916 --> 1:00:50.041
Um...

1:00:50.958 --> 1:00:51.958
Sorry.

1:00:54.208 --> 1:00:56.916
I pay a lot of money for your advice.

1:00:57.708 --> 1:00:59.916
The very least I expect is your attention.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.041
Of course.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:11.541
Oh, you bastard.

1:01:12.416 --> 1:01:14.416
You fucking bastard.

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.708
- Alice!

1:01:53.916 --> 1:01:56.708
Miss Archer. DC Sonny Chandra,
Greater London Police.

1:01:57.458 --> 1:01:58.541
Yeah. Come in.

1:02:05.125 --> 1:02:09.208
We, uh checked with our colleagues
in security services.

1:02:09.208 --> 1:02:12.666
He's not one of theirs. Never has been.

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:14.916
No, of course not.

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.500
- In terms of the money he's withdrawn--
- Stolen.

1:02:19.333 --> 1:02:23.041
Well, on that point, because he was
a joint signatory on the business account,

1:02:23.125 --> 1:02:24.583
it makes it a bit more complicated.

1:02:24.583 --> 1:02:25.708
What do you mean?

1:02:26.750 --> 1:02:30.375
We need to hear his side of the story
to establish if a crime's been committed.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:31.916
You're not serious?

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:34.958
I'm sorry.

1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:41.166
Try not to feel too bad.
This kind of thing happens all the time.

1:02:41.250 --> 1:02:42.583
More often than you think.

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:50.375
He knew I knew. Then he moved first.

1:02:51.125 --> 1:02:52.583
I'm a fucking idiot.

1:02:54.958 --> 1:02:57.666
- You don't have to agree.
- Wh-- No, no, I was...

1:02:58.541 --> 1:03:00.541
Sorry, I was just...

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.833
- <i>Mr. Freegard?</i>
- Yes.

1:03:27.375 --> 1:03:30.166
<i>This is DC Sonny Chandra
with the Greater London Police.</i>

1:03:31.041 --> 1:03:34.916
<i>I need to speak to you about alleged fraud
perpetrated against the bank accounts</i>

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.416
<i>of a Miss Alice Archer.</i>

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.791
Is that what she told you?

1:03:41.416 --> 1:03:43.333
Look,

1:03:43.916 --> 1:03:48.166
we've had a couple of disagreements
about how to proceed with our business.

1:03:48.750 --> 1:03:52.166
Uh, I've withdrawn a sum of money,
which I'm legally entitled to do,

1:03:52.250 --> 1:03:54.541
in order to purchase a fleet of cars.

1:03:55.250 --> 1:03:57.916
But I can assure you,
there is no fraud.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.708
Would you be willing to attend
a police station to discuss it?

1:04:00.708 --> 1:04:02.041
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1:04:02.125 --> 1:04:05.000
<i>Uh... I'm back in London on Wednesday.</i>

1:04:05.625 --> 1:04:07.458
<i>- Say, four p.m.?</i>
- Okay.

1:04:07.458 --> 1:04:11.625
Yep, fine. It's the Notting Hill station.
Ask for me at the front desk. Chandra.

1:04:11.625 --> 1:04:13.208
Great. I'll see you then.

1:04:13.875 --> 1:04:16.125
I'm looking forward
to straightening this out.

1:05:34.916 --> 1:05:37.458
What have I been training you for
all these years?

1:05:37.958 --> 1:05:40.916
- To be a field officer.
- And what is the role of a field officer?

1:05:41.416 --> 1:05:44.458
To blend in and survive
over a long time in any environment.

1:05:44.458 --> 1:05:47.208
Inconspicuous, self-reliant, tough.

1:05:51.541 --> 1:05:52.791
Stay in this postcode.

1:05:52.875 --> 1:05:54.916
Someone will find you
and take you to the program.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.625
- When?
- Will you ask that question in the field?

1:06:00.416 --> 1:06:02.458
Well, consider yourself in the field.

1:06:06.875 --> 1:06:08.458
This is in case I need to contact you.

1:06:09.083 --> 1:06:11.083
There's no credit on it.
Incoming calls only.

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:13.750
If you put credit on
or try to make a call, you have failed.

1:06:13.750 --> 1:06:14.875
Do you understand?

1:06:16.208 --> 1:06:17.208
Yeah.

1:06:47.208 --> 1:06:49.291
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

1:06:50.250 --> 1:06:52.166
You'll probably never hear this message,

1:06:53.541 --> 1:06:55.958
but I want you to know
that you haven't broken me.

1:06:56.916 --> 1:07:00.458
It's important that you know
that you haven't broken me.

1:07:14.958 --> 1:07:17.625
- How are you?
- Good. Fine.

1:07:21.083 --> 1:07:22.500
You look tired.

1:07:23.166 --> 1:07:25.500
You know you should
never say that to a woman.

1:07:27.458 --> 1:07:29.166
I'm saying it to an employee.

1:07:30.750 --> 1:07:32.375
What are you getting at, Andrew?

1:07:33.875 --> 1:07:35.208
I mean, look at yourself.

1:07:35.708 --> 1:07:36.875
You're a mess.

1:07:41.750 --> 1:07:42.791
Okay, look.

1:07:43.625 --> 1:07:46.833
We think you should take some time off.
Couple of weeks.

1:07:46.833 --> 1:07:48.708
- We?
- The partners.

1:07:56.541 --> 1:07:58.375
- Really?
- Really.

1:08:03.666 --> 1:08:05.875
Andrew, tell me straight.

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.541
Should I look for another job?

1:08:13.666 --> 1:08:16.041
If you think you'd be happier
somewhere else,

1:08:17.041 --> 1:08:18.500
yes, sure.

1:08:44.125 --> 1:08:45.125
<i>Alice?</i>

1:08:47.291 --> 1:08:48.541
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:51.458
You're sorry?

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.625
<i>Yeah. I'm truly sorry.</i>

1:08:55.583 --> 1:08:56.833
<i>For everything.</i>

1:08:57.666 --> 1:08:59.958
<i>For the lies. For taking the money.</i>

1:09:01.583 --> 1:09:05.916
<i>Listen, I-- I know you think
it was all one big lie, but it wasn't.</i>

1:09:07.208 --> 1:09:08.291
<i>I love you.</i>

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:13.375
<i>I think you are the only person
I've ever really loved.</i>

1:09:14.250 --> 1:09:15.625
<i>In my whole life.</i>

1:09:17.333 --> 1:09:18.333
<i>Only you.</i>

1:09:20.750 --> 1:09:21.791
<i>I just...</i>

1:09:22.291 --> 1:09:23.958
<i>I just want you to know that.</i>

1:09:25.375 --> 1:09:26.583
<i>Goodbye, Alice.</i>

1:09:27.125 --> 1:09:28.125
-

1:09:34.125 --> 1:09:36.916
<i>The number you have dialed
has not been recognized--</i>

1:09:56.291 --> 1:09:57.875
Can I buy you a drink?

1:09:57.875 --> 1:10:00.083
- Sorry, I'm not--
- Hear me out.

1:10:00.083 --> 1:10:02.333
One minute of your time.
Not a second more.

1:10:03.416 --> 1:10:05.666
So, I was just thinking--

1:10:05.750 --> 1:10:07.666
You were just thinking...

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:10.750
You were just thinking...

1:10:12.125 --> 1:10:13.500
"She's hot.

1:10:14.208 --> 1:10:15.916
- Yeah.
- "Definitely hot."

1:10:17.083 --> 1:10:19.291
"She looks to be at least 30, though,

1:10:19.791 --> 1:10:22.250
which means she's probably
one of those working women

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:24.708
that's starting to get
just a teensy bit desperate."

1:10:24.708 --> 1:10:25.708
No, I was--

1:10:25.708 --> 1:10:28.791
"She's just been sittin' here,
drinkin' alone,

1:10:28.875 --> 1:10:30.916
which means she's probably upset."

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:33.416
"Maybe about a man."

1:10:34.458 --> 1:10:37.875
"Which means she might be in the market
for an anger fuck."

1:10:38.375 --> 1:10:40.083
Or a revenge fuck."

1:10:40.875 --> 1:10:44.125
- "Or maybe just a plain old sad fuck."
- Listen, I wasn't gonna--

1:10:44.125 --> 1:10:46.958
"But if I do get lucky and fuck her.

1:10:47.625 --> 1:10:50.625
oh, I'd better make sure
not to leave any contact details

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:55.541
'cause this is the last kind of girl
I want trackin' me down in the mornin'."

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:59.875
"That would be an absolute train wreck."

1:11:02.250 --> 1:11:04.666
Is that what you were "just thinkin'"?

1:11:48.333 --> 1:11:49.291
Fucking...

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:52.250
Fucking bastard.

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:54.541
Fucking bastard!

1:11:55.625 --> 1:11:57.041
Fucking bastard.

1:12:02.791 --> 1:12:04.625
I need you to help me find him.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.208
- Alice, I don't think that's a good idea.
- I need you to help me, Phil.

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:11.375
Going after this guy is not the answer.

1:12:11.875 --> 1:12:14.625
- The money's long gone.
- It's not about the money anymore.

1:12:14.625 --> 1:12:16.250
Well, then, what is it about?

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:19.416
Revenge? I mean,
that's not gonna happen, Alice.

1:12:24.583 --> 1:12:25.916
He's still in here.

1:12:26.750 --> 1:12:27.750
In my head.

1:12:28.541 --> 1:12:31.875
And he won't get out
until I look him in the eye one last time.

1:12:31.875 --> 1:12:33.791
Okay, listen.

1:12:35.333 --> 1:12:36.625
I was a copper for 18 years.

1:12:36.625 --> 1:12:39.708
When you're doing that job,
you deal with three types of people.

1:12:39.708 --> 1:12:43.500
Mad, sad, and bad.

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.000
"Mad" are people
with everyday mental health problems.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.791
They get in trouble without wan

1:12:47.875 --> 1:12:51.458
"Sad" are people who've had shit lives.
It's obvious why they end up criminals.

1:12:52.125 --> 1:12:54.833
Those two are your vast majority
of perpetrators, but...

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:58.208
"bad" is a different story.

1:12:58.791 --> 1:13:01.833
Sociopaths, psychopaths,
fantasists, manipulators.

1:13:01.833 --> 1:13:05.041
They spend their entire lives
destroying other people.

1:13:05.625 --> 1:13:08.125
They're smart,
they're always one step ahead,

1:13:08.125 --> 1:13:10.083
and they all have one thing in common.

1:13:10.083 --> 1:13:11.291
What's that?

1:13:11.375 --> 1:13:13.208
They can't change.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:15.708
They do what they do again,
and again, and again,

1:13:15.708 --> 1:13:18.166
and they never, ever stop.

1:13:19.916 --> 1:13:23.666
The only thing you can do is try
to stay as far away from them as possible.

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:26.541
The last thing you wanna do
is ever see him again.

1:13:26.625 --> 1:13:29.250
Try to find a way
to put things back together.

1:13:29.250 --> 1:13:33.583
- Loads of firms need people like you.
- No, that's all over now. I'm done.

1:13:42.041 --> 1:13:42.875
Phil.

1:13:44.041 --> 1:13:45.041
Alice.

1:13:49.625 --> 1:13:52.000
Would it surprise you
if I don't take your advice?

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.125
Course it bloody wouldn't.

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:55.500
But for God's sake,

1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:57.708
be careful.

1:13:57.708 --> 1:13:59.958
You're not gonna get better
than nine grand.

1:13:59.958 --> 1:14:01.666
You can-- Daniel will attest to it.

1:14:03.750 --> 1:14:04.875
- Right-oh.
- Mmm.

1:14:05.458 --> 1:14:06.500
Right-oh. So...

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.500
- Wanna take a test drive?
- Yeah.

1:14:09.291 --> 1:14:11.416
- Hi.
- Hello.

1:14:13.333 --> 1:14:14.833
Any idea what you're looking for?

1:14:36.916 --> 1:14:38.833
- Ian Preston?
- Yes.

1:14:38.833 --> 1:14:41.000
Hi. I'm Alice Archer.

1:14:41.583 --> 1:14:43.916
I need to talk to you
about Robert Freegard.

1:14:47.416 --> 1:14:49.875
For two years,
we lived on the run from the IRA.

1:14:50.375 --> 1:14:53.500
We used fake names,
always moving from one place to the next.

1:14:54.458 --> 1:14:57.416
He told us the IRA wanted to kill us
to make an example of us.

1:14:57.916 --> 1:15:01.250
He said if we ever went home
to our families, we'd put them in danger.

1:15:01.250 --> 1:15:04.625
As time went on, he told us
we were candidates for a special program.

1:15:04.625 --> 1:15:05.833
A program?

1:15:05.833 --> 1:15:07.916
A recruitment program to join MI5.

1:15:08.625 --> 1:15:10.083
To make us officers like him.

1:15:10.083 --> 1:15:12.416
But to qualify,
we'd have to pass these tests.

1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:13.791
What kind of tests?

1:15:13.875 --> 1:15:15.125
Spy stuff.

1:15:15.916 --> 1:15:19.166
Delivering an envelope somewhere.
Following someone in the street.

1:15:19.250 --> 1:15:20.750
To prove you were good enough.

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:23.375
And how long did all this go on for?

1:15:23.875 --> 1:15:24.916
For me, it was...

1:15:25.583 --> 1:15:26.583
four years.

1:15:28.333 --> 1:15:29.750
I know it sounds ridiculous,

1:15:29.750 --> 1:15:33.000
but he just has this way
of making you believe...

1:15:34.083 --> 1:15:35.166
you know, anything.

1:15:35.833 --> 1:15:37.833
It doesn't sound ridiculous to me.

1:15:45.083 --> 1:15:46.208
He told me something once.

1:15:47.416 --> 1:15:50.416
It was a... a throwaway thing,
but I never forgot it.

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:54.625
He said everybody's got a story
that they wanna be told.

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:58.000
What was your story?

1:15:59.708 --> 1:16:01.375
Well, look around you.

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:03.250
I'm a farm boy.

1:16:03.916 --> 1:16:06.666
A simple life. Boring, mostly.

1:16:07.375 --> 1:16:09.083
He gave me the opposite of boring.

1:16:11.083 --> 1:16:12.875
What was the story you wanted to hear?

1:16:16.125 --> 1:16:17.666
That I could be free.

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:27.375
Ian, can I ask you,

1:16:28.958 --> 1:16:30.458
how did you get away?

1:16:31.541 --> 1:16:33.041
Um...

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:38.083
Well, I-- I didn't.

1:16:38.583 --> 1:16:39.750
Mmm...

1:16:39.750 --> 1:16:42.958
Yeah, one day, I woke up,
and-- and they were just gone.

1:16:45.916 --> 1:16:47.875
Yeah, I-- I didn't leave Freegard. Um...

1:16:48.958 --> 1:16:49.958
He left me.

1:16:51.250 --> 1:16:53.958
Him and Sophie and Mae
were-- were just gone.

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:55.375
Mae?

1:16:55.875 --> 1:16:58.958
Yeah, Mae Hansen.
Yeah, she was with us for years.

1:16:59.916 --> 1:17:00.791
Hansen?

1:17:09.875 --> 1:17:11.875
Kidnapping?
He hasn't kidnapped anyone!

1:17:11.875 --> 1:17:15.875
In 1993, he takes three students
from Trent Hamilton University.

1:17:15.875 --> 1:17:18.208
Two of them, young women,
haven't been seen since.

1:17:18.208 --> 1:17:21.458
- They got in touch with their families.
- To ask for money.

1:17:21.458 --> 1:17:23.041
Sonny, for fuck's sake.

1:17:23.583 --> 1:17:24.625
Okay, look.

1:17:27.875 --> 1:17:32.083
All right. This is the legal definition
of kidnapping. Read it. Come on. Read it.

1:17:32.083 --> 1:17:34.833
I know what the legal definition is.
This is ridiculous.

1:17:34.833 --> 1:17:39.458
"Kidnapping is the taking of one person
or another by force or fraud."

1:17:39.458 --> 1:17:42.541
Fraud is what he's doing.
This is a common-law indictable offense.

1:17:42.625 --> 1:17:45.250
- We can make this stick.
- We? Are you a CPS lawyer now?

1:17:45.250 --> 1:17:47.041
No, but I'm more of a lawyer than you are.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:51.208
- I'm sorry.
-

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:53.041
Sometimes I get a bit carried away.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:55.250
Yeah, you don't say, yeah.

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:05.250
You say he's been using
Mae Hansen's name?

1:18:05.250 --> 1:18:07.625
Sometimes he uses Robert Hansen.

1:18:07.625 --> 1:18:11.208
Sometimes Robert Hansen-Freegard.
Sometimes just Robert Freegard.

1:18:15.416 --> 1:18:16.833
Well, why would he do that?

1:18:19.291 --> 1:18:20.458
Use her name in particular?

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:27.250
Okay, I'm gonna run Mae Hansen
through the PNC.

1:18:28.375 --> 1:18:31.291
If she ever contacted emergency services,
there'll be an address.

1:18:31.375 --> 1:18:33.291
It's not much, but it's worth a try.

1:18:33.375 --> 1:18:37.125
But I'm warning you, the chances
of this going anywhere are...well...

1:18:38.583 --> 1:18:39.750
Thank you.

1:18:42.875 --> 1:18:44.500
Have you always lived here alone?

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:48.291
Mmm--

1:18:48.791 --> 1:18:51.958
I still haven't been down the aisle,
if that's what you mean.

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:54.750
You?

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.125
Yes, unfortunately.

1:18:59.416 --> 1:19:00.250
Wasn't pretty.

1:19:16.041 --> 1:19:17.041
Sorry.

1:19:19.208 --> 1:19:21.208
What did you do in America?

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.666
Um... I was an academic, in psychology.

1:19:28.875 --> 1:19:30.708
- Psychology?
- Yeah.

1:19:31.708 --> 1:19:33.583
So you better be careful.

1:19:34.541 --> 1:19:36.333
I can read you from a mile off.

1:19:36.333 --> 1:19:37.416
Oh, I will.

1:19:42.166 --> 1:19:43.916
So go on, then. Hmm?

1:19:45.375 --> 1:19:46.375
What's your secret?

1:19:48.250 --> 1:19:49.958
- My secret?
- Yeah.

1:19:51.083 --> 1:19:54.166
A guy like you. Lives all alone.

1:19:54.250 --> 1:19:56.166
Doesn't talk much about his past.

1:19:56.666 --> 1:19:59.791
Makes a mean spaghetti bolognese.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:03.208
What are you hiding?

1:20:06.833 --> 1:20:09.416
- Wow, you are good.
- I am!

1:20:11.250 --> 1:20:12.666
Phew. Uh...

1:20:12.750 --> 1:20:15.000
Well, Jenny...

1:20:15.625 --> 1:20:18.750
I had been meaning to--
to tell you something.

1:20:20.208 --> 1:20:21.916
Uh... it's about my job.

1:20:24.666 --> 1:20:26.291
I'm not really a car salesman.

1:21:00.208 --> 1:21:02.375
Mm. I love this place.

1:21:03.416 --> 1:21:04.708
Yeah, me too.

1:21:09.750 --> 1:21:12.833
Have you ever considered
doing something completely different?

1:21:13.541 --> 1:21:14.541
What do you mean?

1:21:15.916 --> 1:21:17.625
I mean, like a new career.

1:21:18.125 --> 1:21:20.708
Like what?

1:21:20.708 --> 1:21:24.458
Well, this is gonna sound
completely crazy...

1:21:24.458 --> 1:21:26.083
Go on.

1:21:28.666 --> 1:21:29.833
Uh...

1:21:32.291 --> 1:21:35.708
Well, there's a recruitment round
coming up.

1:21:36.625 --> 1:21:37.625
At work.

1:21:38.708 --> 1:21:40.208
For intelligence analysts.

1:21:40.208 --> 1:21:42.000
What?

1:21:43.166 --> 1:21:44.791
Oh my God.

1:21:44.875 --> 1:21:47.416
What? You think I should become a spy?

1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:50.375
No, you wouldn't be a field officer,
you'd be an analyst.

1:21:52.625 --> 1:21:54.833
You have a background in psychology.

1:21:55.791 --> 1:21:57.958
You can read people,
work out their motivations.

1:21:57.958 --> 1:22:01.041
I-- I think you'd be really,
really good at it.

1:22:01.541 --> 1:22:04.791
- But I'm American.
- We recruit NATO allies all the time.

1:22:06.666 --> 1:22:08.041
-

1:22:09.375 --> 1:22:12.500
Robert,
I gotta tell you something.

1:22:13.958 --> 1:22:16.000
Oh, God. Um, okay, here goes.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.500
Um... I am actually on a...

1:22:19.541 --> 1:22:22.208
pretty intense cocktail
of antidepressants.

1:22:22.958 --> 1:22:24.125
Since my divorce.

1:22:25.625 --> 1:22:27.333
So...

1:22:29.166 --> 1:22:32.750
So? I don't see why
that would be a problem.

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:44.833
- And a mushy pea?
- Gross.

1:22:44.833 --> 1:22:46.500
- Really?
- Yeah!

1:22:49.250 --> 1:22:50.625
Listen, Jenny, uh...

1:22:50.625 --> 1:22:52.583
- If you are gonna take this job...
- Mmm?

1:22:52.583 --> 1:22:55.500
There are a couple of things
we need to discuss.

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:01.750
You mentioned you had
a lot of student debt?

1:23:02.250 --> 1:23:03.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:23:04.875 --> 1:23:07.000
It might turn out
to be a bit of a problem.

1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:09.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.208
Everyone who goes to college
in the States is in debt.

1:23:13.125 --> 1:23:14.000
Yeah, I know.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.833
In this country, uh, the security services
see large debts owed by members of staff

1:23:18.833 --> 1:23:21.083
as a potential liability.

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.750
- Yeah, like a blackmail risk.
-

1:23:23.750 --> 1:23:26.083
- Really? Are you kidding me?
- No.

1:23:26.708 --> 1:23:28.416
-
- I know. It's ridiculous.

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.166
They're just--
they're just so set in their ways.

1:23:31.250 --> 1:23:33.083
It's-- it's absurd.

1:23:34.916 --> 1:23:36.625
How much is it, your student debt?

1:23:37.166 --> 1:23:40.375
Shit, I mean,
last time I checked, about...

1:23:41.125 --> 1:23:42.458
$80,000.

1:23:43.875 --> 1:23:46.083
- Yeah. Wow.
- Yeah, that's America.

1:23:46.875 --> 1:23:47.875
Um...

1:23:49.083 --> 1:23:51.666
And you have, uh...
you have no way of paying it back?

1:23:52.166 --> 1:23:54.291
I mean, let me check my pockets.

1:23:54.375 --> 1:23:55.708
No.

1:23:58.875 --> 1:23:59.875
Shit.

1:24:00.791 --> 1:24:01.958
Um...

1:24:01.958 --> 1:24:04.375
Well, listen,
if it really is a problem, I...

1:24:05.375 --> 1:24:07.208
I guess I could ask my folks.

1:24:07.208 --> 1:24:08.250
I mean...

1:24:08.833 --> 1:24:10.208
maybe I could ask them.

1:24:13.166 --> 1:24:15.166
Do you really think
this could be her?

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:17.291
Date of birth matches.

1:24:19.458 --> 1:24:22.083
-

1:24:23.125 --> 1:24:25.291
You just let me
take the lead, okay?

1:24:29.583 --> 1:24:30.708
Mae Hansen?

1:24:33.166 --> 1:24:34.000
Yes.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.000
Did you attend Trent Hamilton University
with Ian Preston and Sophie Jones?

1:24:41.541 --> 1:24:43.500
- Yes.
- I'm Detective Constable Chandra.

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:45.125
We're here about Robert Freegard.

1:24:45.125 --> 1:24:47.958
- Or Hansen-Freegard, as he's also known.
- He's not here at the moment.

1:24:49.833 --> 1:24:50.833
May we come in?

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:57.708
<i>Oh, Jim!
Oh, the chickens are coming in the boat!</i>

1:24:57.708 --> 1:24:58.916
Thank you.

1:25:02.625 --> 1:25:04.875
<i>Depends. I'm going to the forest.</i>

1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:06.541
<i>Please, Jim!</i>

1:25:06.625 --> 1:25:07.875
Who are these children?

1:25:08.375 --> 1:25:09.583
They're our girls.

1:25:10.458 --> 1:25:11.541
Mine and Rob's.

1:25:18.541 --> 1:25:20.166
How often do you see him?

1:25:22.791 --> 1:25:24.125
He comes and goes.

1:25:25.250 --> 1:25:26.708
His work is very important.

1:25:28.583 --> 1:25:30.291
But he looks after you?

1:25:31.750 --> 1:25:32.958
You and the children?

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:40.375
Look, Mae.

1:25:41.416 --> 1:25:42.458
Are you okay?

1:25:44.666 --> 1:25:45.750
Can we help you?

1:25:47.708 --> 1:25:49.541
If you ask for help, I can help you.

1:25:55.916 --> 1:25:57.458
He said this would happen.

1:25:58.208 --> 1:25:59.250
What?

1:25:59.250 --> 1:26:03.541
He said you would come
and try to test me to see if I was loyal.

1:26:05.125 --> 1:26:06.208
No, Mae.

1:26:06.791 --> 1:26:08.041
This isn't a test.

1:26:08.125 --> 1:26:10.958
- Unless you've something else to say, go.
- He's in danger.

1:26:12.416 --> 1:26:13.250
What?

1:26:13.750 --> 1:26:17.375
Rob may be in danger
because of the important work he does,

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:20.458
and we need to find him
because we need to warn him.

1:26:21.041 --> 1:26:22.333
That's all I can say.

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:25.666
You understand? It's national security.

1:26:27.208 --> 1:26:31.166
Now, do you know of anything
that can help us find him?

1:26:31.958 --> 1:26:34.333
- An address, a-- a phone number, anything.
- Listen.

1:26:34.333 --> 1:26:36.625
- I think we should--
- Mae, we need to find him.

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:38.125
We need to warn him.

1:26:38.625 --> 1:26:39.625
Please.

1:26:46.708 --> 1:26:47.833
There's a notebook.

1:26:49.041 --> 1:26:51.541
In his sock drawer.
It has phone numbers in it.

1:26:54.333 --> 1:26:56.250
I can't believe it you did that.
I could be fired.

1:26:56.250 --> 1:26:59.041
It's just mobile phone numbers.
Line after line of them.

1:26:59.125 --> 1:27:00.916
- Must be hundreds.
- It doesn't prove anything.

1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.291
Doesn't prove anything? Are you serious?

1:27:03.375 --> 1:27:05.250
- This could be how we track him down!
- Then what?

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:06.916
- Come on!
- I'm serious. Where's the crime?

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.333
Go on, you're the lawyer. Where?

1:27:08.333 --> 1:27:12.208
And even if we did get all this to court,
what will a jury make of Mae Hansen?

1:27:12.208 --> 1:27:14.875
- She's the mother of his children!
- Don't you see?

1:27:14.875 --> 1:27:16.833
He never ever stops.

1:27:16.833 --> 1:27:19.875
He goes on and on,
destroying people's lives,

1:27:19.875 --> 1:27:21.500
until somebody stops him.

1:27:30.208 --> 1:27:33.708
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
That must have been...

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:37.333
That must have been hard,
seeing the kids and that...

1:27:39.666 --> 1:27:40.833
It's not enough.

1:27:42.333 --> 1:27:43.708
None of this is enough.

1:27:55.041 --> 1:27:57.750
Mum! You don't listen!

1:28:39.125 --> 1:28:41.875
<i>The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.</i>

1:28:41.875 --> 1:28:43.041
<i>Please check and--</i>

1:29:38.458 --> 1:29:40.791
It is a bit strange
they still haven't called.

1:29:40.875 --> 1:29:42.958
It's a lot of money, Robert.

1:29:43.541 --> 1:29:44.541
Takes time.

1:29:48.083 --> 1:29:50.916
Look, I don't have to apply for this job
this time round.

1:29:51.416 --> 1:29:52.416
I can wait.

1:29:53.291 --> 1:29:54.750
I mean, to be honest...

1:29:55.666 --> 1:29:57.583
I'm not even really sure I should apply.

1:29:57.583 --> 1:30:00.333
I don't think you realize
that there won't be a next time.

1:30:02.041 --> 1:30:02.916
Oh...

1:30:05.750 --> 1:30:07.666
- Robert, what are you doing?
-

1:30:10.458 --> 1:30:11.583
What are you doing?

1:30:13.416 --> 1:30:15.041
What the fuck are you doing?

1:30:15.125 --> 1:30:18.041
- You don't need those things.
- Those are my meds! I need my meds!

1:30:18.125 --> 1:30:20.625
No, we're gonna get you off them,
starting today.

1:30:20.625 --> 1:30:22.875
Those aren't drugs
you can quit, cold turkey.

1:30:22.875 --> 1:30:25.041
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1:30:25.125 --> 1:30:27.250
Yes, you can. I'm right here, okay?

1:30:27.833 --> 1:30:30.500
I'm right here. I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:32.208
I promise you, Jenny.

1:30:33.083 --> 1:30:34.833
This is a good thing, okay?

1:30:35.625 --> 1:30:37.541
It's a good thing. It's a good thing.

1:30:38.916 --> 1:30:39.833
Hey.

1:31:01.083 --> 1:31:03.125
- Out all night again?
- Piss off.

1:31:05.541 --> 1:31:07.708
- You were right.
- What?

1:31:08.375 --> 1:31:09.583
He never stops.

1:31:10.875 --> 1:31:11.875
Can you come with me?

1:31:11.875 --> 1:31:13.250
Where are we going?

1:31:13.750 --> 1:31:15.125
To the American embassy.

1:31:18.166 --> 1:31:19.291
Give me ten minutes.

1:31:22.208 --> 1:31:23.041
Five.

1:31:24.375 --> 1:31:27.791
Thank you for coming, Miss Archer.
Special Agent Harland.

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:30.000
Please, follow me.

1:31:34.666 --> 1:31:35.916
Have a seat.

1:31:41.500 --> 1:31:42.500
So,

1:31:43.125 --> 1:31:46.666
I understand that you have
some experience of this guy.

1:31:47.291 --> 1:31:48.666
What's all this about?

1:31:50.375 --> 1:31:55.083
The FBI is concerned about the whereabouts
of an American citizen.

1:31:56.291 --> 1:31:57.333
Jenny Jackson.

1:31:57.833 --> 1:32:01.458
She's been here in the UK
for three months.

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.166
Usually, she calls her parents
several times a week,

1:32:05.250 --> 1:32:06.500
but about three weeks ago,

1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:08.833
she darn near fell off
the face of the Earth.

1:32:09.625 --> 1:32:11.291
Then a couple of days ago,

1:32:11.791 --> 1:32:14.041
she called her parents in Connecticut

1:32:14.541 --> 1:32:17.916
and asked them for $80,000.

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:22.333
She said she needed to clear
her student debt in preparation for a job

1:32:22.333 --> 1:32:25.041
that her boyfriend was providing for her.

1:32:25.583 --> 1:32:29.166
The boyfriend goes by the name
of Robert Freegard.

1:32:34.125 --> 1:32:36.083
Did you get
comms surveillance up on him?

1:32:36.833 --> 1:32:38.291
We never got that far.

1:32:41.416 --> 1:32:43.875
I have a notebook.

1:32:45.166 --> 1:32:48.541
It's just numbers.
All his-- his burner phones.

1:32:48.625 --> 1:32:51.416
I've called about half of them,
but they're all disconnected.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:53.291
Can you show 'em to me?

1:32:55.208 --> 1:32:57.250
- What?
- Agent Harland.

1:32:58.250 --> 1:33:00.666
I don't want your people
calling those numbers.

1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:02.791
Excuse me?

1:33:02.875 --> 1:33:05.041
If we get through to Robert or Jenny

1:33:05.125 --> 1:33:07.583
or any of his victims,
they could really screw this up.

1:33:07.583 --> 1:33:11.041
We have just one shot at this. Just one.

1:33:11.125 --> 1:33:16.041
My agents are trained investigators. Negotiators.

1:33:16.125 --> 1:33:18.416
But they don't know
Robert Freegard like I do.

1:33:19.458 --> 1:33:22.375
- Let me make the calls.
- I can get a court order.

1:33:25.083 --> 1:33:28.083
Actually, you'd need
an evidential retrieval order.

1:33:28.083 --> 1:33:30.125
That's usually a High Court matter.

1:33:32.208 --> 1:33:33.333
I see what you mean.

1:33:35.333 --> 1:33:38.083
You make the calls. I listen in.

1:33:38.791 --> 1:33:39.916
We work together.

1:33:40.416 --> 1:33:41.416
Deal.

1:34:05.958 --> 1:34:08.666
<i>The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.</i>

1:34:08.750 --> 1:34:10.541
<i>Please check and dial again.</i>

1:34:14.416 --> 1:34:17.041
<i>The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.</i>

1:34:17.125 --> 1:34:18.916
<i>Please check and dial again.</i>

1:34:20.375 --> 1:34:22.041
- Hey. <i>- The number you have dialed...</i>

1:34:22.125 --> 1:34:25.833
Yeah, get me purchase points
on every handset on this list.

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.958
Put 'em all on a map. Plot 'em out.

1:34:28.958 --> 1:34:30.500
Get 'em right to me. Thanks.

1:34:31.583 --> 1:34:33.583
- They going through on your end?
- All good.

1:34:33.583 --> 1:34:34.791
Perfect.

1:34:35.375 --> 1:34:36.375
<i>Hello?</i>

1:34:37.416 --> 1:34:38.916
<i>Rob? Hello?</i>

1:34:40.291 --> 1:34:41.291
Sophie?

1:34:43.291 --> 1:34:44.500
Let me call you back.

1:34:46.125 --> 1:34:47.125
Who's this?

1:34:47.625 --> 1:34:48.750
<i>Sophie...</i>

1:34:48.750 --> 1:34:51.166
Um... My name's Alice.

1:34:51.250 --> 1:34:54.750
I'm a-- I'm a colleague of Rob's.
I work with him.

1:34:54.750 --> 1:34:56.041
<i>Where is Rob?</i>

1:34:56.791 --> 1:34:59.083
I can't discuss that on the phone, Sophie.

1:35:00.041 --> 1:35:02.375
Listen. We're ready to bring you in.

1:35:03.041 --> 1:35:04.416
Oh...

1:35:05.625 --> 1:35:07.375
Have-- have I passed?

1:35:09.416 --> 1:35:11.458
That-- that's right, Sophie. You have.

1:35:12.291 --> 1:35:13.500
<i>You've passed.</i>

1:35:16.625 --> 1:35:18.791
Rob said it would be him
that brought me in.

1:35:19.291 --> 1:35:22.583
<i>He's on a mission.
You'll see him very soon.</i>

1:35:25.250 --> 1:35:26.291
Okay.

1:35:26.791 --> 1:35:29.208
Sophie, where are you?

1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:31.750
What's your location?

1:35:33.875 --> 1:35:34.833
Um...

1:35:36.916 --> 1:35:37.916
Mom,

1:35:38.708 --> 1:35:40.666
if you could send the money,

1:35:40.750 --> 1:35:43.083
it will really help
with this new opportunity.

1:35:43.916 --> 1:35:45.125
This means a lot to me,

1:35:45.125 --> 1:35:48.875
and everything will go smoothly
once the debt has been cleared.

1:35:50.666 --> 1:35:51.666
Mom?

1:35:52.583 --> 1:35:55.291
I really need you
to send this money, okay? Please.

1:36:04.291 --> 1:36:06.666
- I'm really not feeling very well, Robert.
- Sh.

1:36:09.208 --> 1:36:10.583
Can you help me?

1:36:19.791 --> 1:36:21.708
Okay, listen. This is important.

1:36:22.208 --> 1:36:24.625
When we get to her,
we can't tell her the truth.

1:36:24.625 --> 1:36:25.541
Wait. What?

1:36:25.625 --> 1:36:29.958
If we want to find Jenny,
we can't tell Sophie Jones the truth.

1:36:29.958 --> 1:36:31.458
- Not yet.
- Why not?

1:36:32.791 --> 1:36:34.583
Because it would destroy her.

1:37:08.625 --> 1:37:09.625
Robert.

1:37:11.625 --> 1:37:13.125
I...

1:37:14.791 --> 1:37:16.125
I need my meds.

1:38:16.375 --> 1:38:17.750
Hello, Sophie.

1:38:19.541 --> 1:38:20.541
I'm Alice.

1:38:24.666 --> 1:38:25.833
Those are my colleagues.

1:38:27.125 --> 1:38:28.375
Are you ready to go?

1:38:29.166 --> 1:38:31.250
-
- Sophie...

1:38:32.416 --> 1:38:33.625
You've done so well.

1:38:37.875 --> 1:38:40.208
Oh... It's okay.

1:38:41.416 --> 1:38:42.416
It's okay.

1:38:57.250 --> 1:38:58.625
Now, then...

1:39:07.708 --> 1:39:08.791
There you are.

1:39:09.583 --> 1:39:11.083
You can puke there all you want.

1:39:53.583 --> 1:39:55.791
As part of your training with Rob,

1:39:56.708 --> 1:39:59.166
you stayed in a lot of safe houses, yes?

1:39:59.250 --> 1:40:00.708
Yeah, dozens.

1:40:00.708 --> 1:40:03.541
And did any of them stand out to you?

1:40:04.416 --> 1:40:05.541
What do you mean?

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.083
Do any of them feel different?

1:40:09.083 --> 1:40:12.000
Like, maybe somewhere
that felt more like home.

1:40:14.708 --> 1:40:15.666
Um...

1:40:18.583 --> 1:40:21.583
Well, there-- there was one place I...

1:40:22.291 --> 1:40:25.791
- I had to wear a blindfold on the way.
- Yeah, yeah. Exactly like that.

1:40:26.416 --> 1:40:29.208
And do you remember,
even roughly, where it was?

1:40:31.333 --> 1:40:32.958
Well, um...

1:40:33.541 --> 1:40:38.125
Rob taught me that if...
if you're deprived of one of your senses,

1:40:38.125 --> 1:40:41.708
you can learn what you need
to know from the others, so, um...

1:40:42.333 --> 1:40:44.541
we came sou-- south out of Cambridge,

1:40:45.166 --> 1:40:48.833
um, and then when we came off the M11,
that's when I put the blindfold on.

1:40:49.791 --> 1:40:50.958
Um...

1:40:50.958 --> 1:40:53.958
So, we went straight
for about ten minutes.

1:40:53.958 --> 1:40:56.041
I counted the seconds. And then...

1:40:56.791 --> 1:41:00.250
we turned left, up into the hills,
for about 30 minutes.

1:41:04.333 --> 1:41:05.333
It fits.

1:41:05.833 --> 1:41:09.500
There's a cluster of handsets that
were purchased right by Saffron Walden.

1:41:10.125 --> 1:41:11.375
Well done, Sophie.

1:41:12.750 --> 1:41:13.750
Well done.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000
So I would keep to the right...

1:41:29.208 --> 1:41:31.666
I'm really sorry. I just...

1:41:32.250 --> 1:41:35.666
- I can't remember exactly where.
- It's fine. Really.

1:41:36.458 --> 1:41:37.583
You're doing great.

1:42:23.458 --> 1:42:25.875
<i>Hello? Jenny, honey, is that you?</i>

1:42:26.375 --> 1:42:27.875
<i>Rob? Is this Rob?</i>

1:42:27.875 --> 1:42:28.958
Yes.

1:42:30.250 --> 1:42:31.958
<i>Can I speak to Jenny, please?</i>

1:42:31.958 --> 1:42:34.458
No, not right now. She's taking a bath.

1:42:34.458 --> 1:42:38.125
<i>Okay, look. We've transferred the money.
It-- it's all there.</i>

1:42:38.708 --> 1:42:39.541
Right.

1:42:39.625 --> 1:42:42.333
<i>- Can you tell her that, please</i>?
- I'll let her know.

1:42:42.958 --> 1:42:43.916
Thank you.

1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.333
<i>Well-- Rob, please, uh, tell me.
Is she okay?</i>

1:42:48.125 --> 1:42:49.375
Yeah, she's fine.

1:42:49.375 --> 1:42:50.541
<i>Uh...</i>

1:42:50.625 --> 1:42:52.041
<i>- Okay--</i>
- Talk soon, okay?

1:42:52.125 --> 1:42:53.125
<i>- Wh--</i>
-

1:43:03.125 --> 1:43:05.583
It's gettin' dark.
We should come back tomorrow.

1:43:05.583 --> 1:43:06.666
No.

1:43:07.166 --> 1:43:08.666
Let's keep going.

1:43:10.958 --> 1:43:11.958
Okay.

1:43:42.166 --> 1:43:43.166
Jenny.

1:43:44.875 --> 1:43:46.333
Jenny, I've got some good news.

1:43:46.833 --> 1:43:48.666
Your folks have sent the money.

1:43:50.708 --> 1:43:52.625
How great is that?

1:43:57.541 --> 1:43:58.541
Hey, listen.

1:43:59.583 --> 1:44:02.458
Uh, I think there might be
some of your medicine in the car.

1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:05.125
I'll go and check, shall I?

1:44:08.625 --> 1:44:09.708
Jenny.

1:44:12.875 --> 1:44:14.708
Jenny, everything's gonna be okay now.

1:44:50.083 --> 1:44:51.083
Alice.

1:44:53.333 --> 1:44:55.583
You have to stop at some point, Robert.

1:44:56.333 --> 1:44:57.875
This can't go on forever.

1:45:01.541 --> 1:45:02.791
You're not alone.

1:45:10.666 --> 1:45:12.541
- Come with me.
- What?

1:45:13.333 --> 1:45:15.583
You didn't come here
'cause you wanted to catch me.

1:45:16.291 --> 1:45:19.708
You came because you wanted to see
if what I said on the phone was true.

1:45:21.208 --> 1:45:23.833
If you're the only person
I've ever really loved.

1:45:23.833 --> 1:45:26.625
-
- Well, Alice, it is true.

1:45:27.708 --> 1:45:30.541
You know it's true. You're the only one.

1:45:32.875 --> 1:45:34.041
Alice, look at me.

1:45:35.666 --> 1:45:37.083
Look at me, Alice.

1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:39.916
I think you're my last chance, Alice.

1:45:42.125 --> 1:45:43.750
- I can change. I can.
-

1:45:44.375 --> 1:45:46.750
Come on. There's a life for us.

1:45:47.458 --> 1:45:49.666
Me and you. Let's get out of here.

1:45:51.333 --> 1:45:54.708
Just fuck it.
Let's get in the car. The keys are there.

1:45:55.708 --> 1:45:56.708
Come on.

1:45:58.250 --> 1:45:59.583
You run, they'll catch you.

1:45:59.583 --> 1:46:00.750
No, they won't.

1:46:01.833 --> 1:46:03.458
They won't.

1:46:04.125 --> 1:46:06.583
Come on. Let's go.

1:46:07.375 --> 1:46:09.875
Alice, this is it, okay?
It's now or never.

1:46:11.250 --> 1:46:12.416
Alice, please.

1:46:14.208 --> 1:46:16.458
- Alice?
- Fuck's sake.

1:46:16.458 --> 1:46:17.958
Alice!

1:46:45.041 --> 1:46:46.166
Sophie.

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:53.708
- Thanks.
- Right.

1:46:53.708 --> 1:46:57.416
Right, we're taking the suspect
back now, sir...

1:47:19.041 --> 1:47:20.708
She's gonna be okay.

1:47:22.666 --> 1:47:24.250
Physically, anyway.

1:47:57.041 --> 1:47:59.125
-
- Oh!

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.083
I'm so happy you're safe.

1:48:14.708 --> 1:48:16.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:48:27.625 --> 1:48:31.875
Anyone entering that world
left behind the lives they had before.

1:48:33.916 --> 1:48:35.708
The people they once were.

1:48:35.708 --> 1:48:38.000
That was the price they had to pay.

1:48:38.833 --> 1:48:41.791
And many of us in this room
have paid dearly.

1:48:43.375 --> 1:48:46.583
He promised us freedom,
but actually, he took it away.

1:48:47.166 --> 1:48:50.500
But we're standing here
as proof that there is a way out.

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.958
From now on,
we get to tell our own stories.

1:48:55.291 --> 1:48:56.666
That's real freedom.

1:48:59.583 --> 1:49:01.000
Thank you, Miss Archer.

1:49:02.291 --> 1:49:06.458
And I also understand you're no longer
a practicing lawyer. Is that correct?

1:49:07.291 --> 1:49:08.666
I'm a company director.

1:49:09.541 --> 1:49:13.333
My company leases luxury cars
to corporate clients.

1:49:30.291 --> 1:49:32.833
- Oh, we're closing in ten minutes.
- That's okay.

1:49:36.875 --> 1:49:37.875
Thanks.

1:49:38.541 --> 1:49:39.541
Thank you.

1:49:40.291 --> 1:49:42.291
-

1:50:18.625 --> 1:50:19.791
Sorry.

1:50:19.875 --> 1:50:21.375
I've gotta ask.

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.416
Some of the screws are saying
that you're not really a lag.

1:50:28.875 --> 1:50:31.041
They're saying you're MI5 or somethin'.

1:50:32.041 --> 1:50:34.666
You're investigating the Bailey gang
down on the ones.

1:50:39.416 --> 1:50:42.625
I can't talk about that.
And neither should you.

1:50:43.333 --> 1:50:46.416
- That kind of talk could get me killed.
- Yeah, course.

1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:48.875
Your secret's safe with me.

1:50:50.250 --> 1:50:54.125
Now, if... if there's anything you need,
you just ask.

1:50:55.041 --> 1:50:56.041
Yeah.

1:51:30.708 --> 1:51:31.833
You all right?

1:51:36.416 --> 1:51:38.125
You know, it goes on forever.

1:51:39.250 --> 1:51:40.500
Never stops.

1:51:42.875 --> 1:51:43.875
We'll see.

1:52:16.875 --> 1:52:21.375
<i>‚ô™ "Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick" ‚ô™</i>

1:52:21.375 --> 1:52:25.333
<i>‚ô™ "The one that makes me scream"
She said ‚ô™</i>

1:52:25.333 --> 1:52:29.083
<i>‚ô™ "The one that makes me laugh" she said ‚ô™</i>

1:52:29.083 --> 1:52:33.208
<i>‚ô™ And threw her arms around my neck ‚ô™</i>

1:52:33.208 --> 1:52:36.416
<i>‚ô™ Show me how you do it ‚ô™</i>

1:52:36.500 --> 1:52:38.625
<i>‚ô™ And I promise you ‚ô™</i>

1:52:38.625 --> 1:52:42.458
<i>‚ô™ I promise that I'll run away with you ‚ô™</i>

1:52:44.125 --> 1:52:46.833
<i>‚ô™ I'll run away with you ‚ô™</i>

1:53:03.875 --> 1:53:07.708
<i>‚ô™ Spinning on that dizzy edge ‚ô™</i>

1:53:07.708 --> 1:53:11.333
<i>‚ô™ I kissed her face, I kissed her head ‚ô™</i>

1:53:11.333 --> 1:53:15.250
<i>‚ô™ I dream of all the different ways ‚ô™</i>

1:53:15.250 --> 1:53:18.125
<i>‚ô™ I had to make it work ‚ô™</i>

1:53:19.458 --> 1:53:23.458
<i>‚ô™ "Why are you so far away?" she said ‚ô™</i>

1:53:23.458 --> 1:53:26.291
<i>‚ô™ Oh, won't you ever know ‚ô™</i>

1:53:26.375 --> 1:53:29.208
<i>‚ô™ That I'm in love with you? ‚ô™</i>

1:53:30.208 --> 1:53:32.708
<i>‚ô™ That I'm in love with you ‚ô™</i>

1:53:34.750 --> 1:53:38.583
<i>‚ô™ You, soft and only ‚ô™</i>

1:53:38.583 --> 1:53:42.250
<i>‚ô™ You, lost and lonely ‚ô™</i>

1:53:42.250 --> 1:53:46.291
<i>‚ô™ You, strange as angels ‚ô™</i>

1:53:46.375 --> 1:53:49.958
<i>‚ô™ Dancing in the deepest oceans ‚ô™</i>

1:53:49.958 --> 1:53:52.625
<i>‚ô™ Twisting in the water ‚ô™</i>

1:53:52.625 --> 1:53:57.416
<i>‚ô™ You're just like a dream
Daylight licked me into shape ‚ô™</i>

1:53:57.500 --> 1:54:01.500
<i>‚ô™ I must have been asleep for days ‚ô™</i>

1:54:01.500 --> 1:54:05.125
<i>‚ô™ And moving lips to breathe her name ‚ô™</i>

1:54:05.125 --> 1:54:09.041
<i>‚ô™ I opened up my eyes ‚ô™</i>

1:54:09.125 --> 1:54:12.958
<i>‚ô™ And found myself alone, alone ‚ô™</i>

1:54:12.958 --> 1:54:16.541
<i>‚ô™ Alone above a raging sea ‚ô™</i>

1:54:16.625 --> 1:54:20.541
<i>‚ô™ That stole the only girl I loved ‚ô™</i>

1:54:20.625 --> 1:54:24.708
<i>‚ô™ And drowned her deep inside of me ‚ô™</i>

1:54:24.708 --> 1:54:28.458
<i>‚ô™ You, soft and only ‚ô™</i>

1:54:28.458 --> 1:54:32.250
<i>‚ô™ You, lost and lonely ‚ô™</i>

1:54:32.250 --> 1:54:37.208
<i>‚ô™ You, just like heaven ‚ô™</i>
