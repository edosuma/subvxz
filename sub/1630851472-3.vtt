01:13.920 --> 01:20.520
<i>There was once a mer-king who was
married to a beautiful mer-queen.</i>

01:20.600 --> 01:23.600
<i>And they were truly happy together.</i>

01:26.160 --> 01:28.000
<i>Until one day the king had to travel</i>

01:28.080 --> 01:32.160
<i>to the outer reaches
of his watery kingdom.</i>

01:35.160 --> 01:39.960
<i>When he came home,
he found the queen sitting on a rock</i>

01:40.040 --> 01:44.600
<i>in the arms of a human. A sailor.</i>

01:45.960 --> 01:50.280
<i>And the queen was singing to him
in a voice as clear as glass</i>

01:51.160 --> 01:54.640
<i>as the sailor
was brushing her hair.</i>

02:13.320 --> 02:15.240
Jo, what are you doing?

02:24.440 --> 02:26.880
Come on, are you gonna tell me
what she said?

02:30.040 --> 02:31.880
Oh, you mean Rose?

02:33.760 --> 02:36.680
Oh... the girl who works where I work

02:36.760 --> 02:39.560
doing the job
that nobody told me I have.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.920
Right, the thing is
you don't actually have a job

02:46.000 --> 02:48.600
and you don't actually work there.
They let you go.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.760
That's not what she said.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.720
Just before your accident,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.360
after everything
that you'd done for them,

02:58.440 --> 03:00.000
they treated you really badly, Jo.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.000
And that woman, Rose, is nuts.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.800
And Nick is so far up
his own arsehole.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.640
Screw 'em. They used you.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.640
Hasn't anyone mentioned
you had a new job?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.160
Don't you think that's a bit...

03:14.240 --> 03:16.000
That's when you dyed your hair.

03:16.080 --> 03:16.920
JUNE

03:17.000 --> 03:19.360
And you really don't
remember anything?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.640
<i>You're still staring into a void, Jo.</i>

03:32.160 --> 03:33.880
<i>And you're totally at the mercy</i>

03:33.960 --> 03:37.360
<i>of whatever people are willing
to tell you.</i>

03:39.400 --> 03:43.120
THE FALL
LOST JOB

03:48.240 --> 03:50.600
<i>So, what are they not telling you?</i>

04:00.320 --> 04:03.280
Get out of my fucking house!

04:10.680 --> 04:12.040
You OK?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.880
No. No.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.080
Not really.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.040
- What's up?
- I have to tell you something.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.120
There was somebody else in the house.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.240
- What?
- When I fell down the stairs.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.800
I wasn't alone.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.680
I remembered when she...
when Rose was here.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.000
I'm not sure
if it was just before I fell or...

04:44.480 --> 04:45.280
What?

04:49.960 --> 04:52.120
Did we have a row?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.640
- Was it you?
- No!

04:57.800 --> 04:59.040
Have you slept on this?

05:00.480 --> 05:01.720
There was something stolen.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.360
Maybe somebody broke in
and that's why I can't find my phone.

05:05.440 --> 05:09.160
Are you seriously suggesting to me
that somebody else was in this house?

05:11.520 --> 05:15.480
I was screaming... at somebody.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.000
Well you must have some idea
who that was.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.880
I was thinking that maybe we...

05:23.640 --> 05:26.120
That I went and got drunk or...

05:26.200 --> 05:30.600
Or maybe we...
I came home drunk and then we...

05:31.880 --> 05:35.200
It's all so muddled.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.200
Why do you keep saying we?

05:41.280 --> 05:47.160
Get your coat. We need
to tell the police about this.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.600
Get your coat, Jo.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.960
Please, try and think.
Think about who it was.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.480
I am.
It's just it's hard remember exactly.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.440
Anything about them.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.800
Fuck, Jo. Why did you wait
to tell me this.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.840
- I'm sorry.
- What were you thinking?

06:20.920 --> 06:22.280
You were screaming at them.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.280
Do you remember
what you were screaming?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.080
Get the fuck out of my house!

06:27.160 --> 06:28.440
Shit.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.800
I think I said, "Get out of..."

06:36.880 --> 06:38.880
"Get out of my fucking house."

06:38.960 --> 06:41.840
That doesn't sound like something
you'd say to anybody we know.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.680
But it's great
that you're starting to remember.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.880
No, it's not. It's not great.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.160
They can check the house for DNA,
fingerprints, signs of a break-in.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.200
- It's too late for that.
- How do you know?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.120
I can't believe
that somebody was in our house...

06:55.200 --> 06:58.160
I keep seeing your boards everywhere.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.640
None of them have "sold" on them.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.120
You need to focus.
Is anything else coming back to you?

07:04.200 --> 07:05.920
Get the fuck out of my house!

07:07.880 --> 07:10.280
- I can't do this, OK? I can't.
- What?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.040
- I can't do it!
- Don't be ridiculous.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.440
Stop! Stop!

07:18.680 --> 07:19.840
Are you OK?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.600
OK, OK, OK.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.120
It's OK.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.120
It's alright.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.400
Maybe there wasn't anybody
in the house. I don't know.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.720
I feel like someone
broke into my head,

07:57.800 --> 08:01.480
and trashed the place
and now I can't find anything.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.440
It's...

08:06.520 --> 08:12.200
I don't feel safe inside my own head.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.280
I'm sorry.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.480
Oh, my God.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.680
Oh, come on!

08:32.840 --> 08:34.080
Such a dad.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.680
That's the first time
I've seen you laugh for ages.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.800
I love you with all my heart
and I'm so sorry for all this shit.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.600
<i>Look at his head,</i>

09:07.680 --> 09:10.640
<i>so full
of all the things you've lost.</i>

09:10.720 --> 09:14.800
<i>Don't you just want
to cleave it open like a coconut?</i>

09:14.880 --> 09:17.720
<i>Scrape out the bits you need.</i>

09:44.240 --> 09:46.720
Get out of my fucking house!

09:57.720 --> 10:00.280
<i>Who was in the house, Dad?</i>

10:38.880 --> 10:42.320
Hey. I'm at my dad's.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.440
I took a taxi.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.600
I don't know how long, Rob.
I'm fine. Please stop worrying.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.640
Bye.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.840
Jo?

11:24.240 --> 11:27.360
Oh, hi! You're the dog lady.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.800
You were in my dream.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.040
What are you doing here?

11:33.120 --> 11:37.320
Yes, I have dogs.
But I am fully human.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.760
I heard about your accident
and your...

11:41.840 --> 11:45.680
Really awful. I'm really sorry.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.320
- Wendy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.680
Would it be alright if I came over
and we could talk

11:53.760 --> 11:57.000
- and you might help me remember.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.120
There she is! Mrs. H!

13:08.200 --> 13:11.560
Look, Frederik.
It's your daughter, Jo.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.160
- Jo's come to see you.
- No, no, no, no.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.840
- Hey, Dad.
- It's your daughter, Jo.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.960
- Where is Susanne?
- This Jo, Fred.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.520
Susanne was my mother.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.240
Dad, I'm really sorry
I haven't been to see you in a while.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.560
I was in an accident,
so I couldn't.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.640
But I've been desperate
to come and see you.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.200
Dad. Dad, it's Johanne.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.320
Little Johanne, see?

14:11.080 --> 14:15.840
He didn't sleep too well last night,
did you, Fred? Eh?

14:15.920 --> 14:19.640
Up all night partying.
Come on.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.760
There we go. Careful.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.080
Maybe I could tell him a story?

14:32.240 --> 14:35.280
What do you think, Dad?
You love stories.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.840
I'm sure he'd love that.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.480
Do you remember the one
about the old mer-king

14:45.560 --> 14:47.640
you used to tell me
when I was little?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.120
I've been thinking about it lately.

14:53.640 --> 14:59.120
He found his queen with the sailor
and he was furious.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.280
It used to send shivers
down my spine.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.480
Danish stories are quite dark.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.000
Who are you?

15:08.280 --> 15:12.480
It's Jo, Dad.
I'm a bit like you these days.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.720
I don't know which way is up.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.960
I... I want to see Susanne.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
Hi.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.320
Dad asked me to...

15:41.360 --> 15:42.520
Mum.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.680
I didn't get to say goodbye.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.760
He's still Grandpa.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.800
You know he has better days
than this. He's still there.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.200
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.240
Hey, um. I've got some news
that might cheer you up.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.200
Um... I'm pregnant.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.440
- What's your boyfriend's name?
- Thomas.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.680
Wow!

16:21.640 --> 16:23.280
I didn't know about the baby before?

16:23.360 --> 16:26.640
No, no. You're actually
the first person we've told.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.080
It's about time you knew something
that no one else knows.

16:31.160 --> 16:37.880
Fuck! I'm about to be a grandma.
Tick tock.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.280
- Oh, no! Oh, Mum!
- It's good crying.

16:45.160 --> 16:49.400
Oh, my baby! I'm so happy for you.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.840
But you <i>have</i> to take care of yourself
from now on.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.800
Mum...

17:03.040 --> 17:05.240
Will you tell Dad about the baby?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.360
Well, don't you want to?

17:07.440 --> 17:11.960
Um... He doesn't like Thomas.

17:14.880 --> 17:20.200
- OK. But I do, right?
- Yeah. He makes you laugh.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.480
Yes!

17:22.560 --> 17:26.640
You just... You know
what Dad can be like sometimes.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.480
- He's a wanker.
- Is he really that awful?

18:23.560 --> 18:24.640
He's really that awful.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.080
The minute he came into her life,
we all disappeared.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.840
Everything's about him.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.960
Alright. But we're going
to be grandparents, Rob.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.880
Great! Years of hearing him
talk about how successful his bar is.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.880
I know you're waiting for me
to sign those loan papers, Rob.

18:44.960 --> 18:45.960
How desperate is it?

18:46.040 --> 18:49.040
Honestly, I don't think
we'll make it til Christmas.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.560
You know, Jo,
I don't like asking you for money.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.280
I don't like asking begging you
to save my life's work, but...

18:56.360 --> 19:00.120
I... You've got a small chain
of estate agents.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.080
You're not finding the cure
for cancer.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.280
How's the disinhibition going, Jo?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.520
Cos it's a real blast
for the rest of us.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.360
Sash said she wanted me to tell you
about the pregnancy

19:22.440 --> 19:25.120
because she says
she knows what you can be like.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.880
Why is she so afraid of you?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.360
What? She isn't.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.800
You know what Jo,
I'd really appreciate

19:35.880 --> 19:38.240
if you fucked off
out of my office now.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.120
Go on.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.280
Can you take a picture of us?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.000
Smile!

21:10.080 --> 21:11.480
Oh, fuck!

21:17.200 --> 21:20.280
Oh, hi, Jo. I'm afraid
we've just ended the session.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.040
I can see that.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.000
I've got a bit of time.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.840
Yep. That's great, thanks.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.560
- I should probably just go.
- No, wait. Wait there. Stay there!

21:41.200 --> 21:42.680
I mean it. Don't move.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.560
Ask you... Ask you something.
Anything.

21:55.640 --> 21:59.760
OK. What happened to you?

21:59.840 --> 22:03.960
I was on my honeymoon.
Skiing accident.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.200
And I crashed into a tree
at 100 mph.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.040
My God. You're mad.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.560
Do you know that that's actually
really dangerous?

22:11.640 --> 22:13.440
I don't care.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.280
Don't you find that you're just
not afraid of anything anymore?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.680
You know, since cheating death.

22:19.760 --> 22:24.240
Nowadays, if I wanna do something,
I just do it.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.080
Fuck the consequences.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.120
What about the guy you married?
Did he stick around?

22:37.920 --> 22:39.040
Nah.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.400
- Fucker.
- Yeah.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.240
I'm afraid of everything.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.440
I don't know who to trust anymore.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.360
It's like everyone around me,

22:57.440 --> 23:02.720
they know everything that happened
last year but I don't.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.360
And I think
they're hiding things from me.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.760
But then I get these little clues.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.160
You need to listen
to that voice in your head, Jo.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.160
Your intuition.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.040
Just follow the breadcrumbs,
see where they lead you.

23:21.200 --> 23:29.120
I... I think I may have been
having sex with someone.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.040
Someone decidedly not my husband.

23:41.760 --> 23:47.720
My mother had affairs, and I swore
I'd never ever do anything like that.

23:51.080 --> 23:56.400
Part of me thinks
that maybe my husband knew.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.800
Wow!

24:09.280 --> 24:13.960
Maybe he's not saying anything
because of what happened.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.080
I lost a baby 15 years ago.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.280
Nearly pushed me over the edge.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.160
Every year on his birthday...

24:31.680 --> 24:36.440
...I wonder what kind of boy
he would have become.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.920
What was his name?

24:48.440 --> 24:49.720
Lucas.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.680
Jo.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.800
Sorry to interrupt,

26:13.880 --> 26:17.640
but if you can spare a bit of time?
There's something I'd like to say.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.440
I'm sorry, Jo, that...

26:35.560 --> 26:37.840
...that I get so knotted up.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.040
I'm an arsehole.

26:40.280 --> 26:43.800
There's somewhere I want to take you,
if you'll come with me.

26:49.560 --> 26:54.320
<i>One minute he's saying "fuck off",
and then next he's inviting you away.</i>

26:55.160 --> 26:56.960
<i>What's going on, Rob?</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:11.800
You ready?

27:11.880 --> 27:14.520
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm not telling you.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
Where are you taking me, Rob?

27:36.400 --> 27:39.400
Do you remember
when the kids were young?

27:39.480 --> 27:41.960
Whenever we went on holiday,
just before we drove off,

27:42.040 --> 27:46.360
you'd run back inside
and rearrange all their toys

27:46.440 --> 27:49.800
so it would look like they'd been
on an adventure while we were away?

27:51.160 --> 27:54.560
I used to love seeing
their little faces when we got back.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.480
No one's too old for a surprise, Jo.
Come on, let me have this.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.680
You always wanted
to come here, right?

29:35.840 --> 29:40.520
<i>When the mer-king came back,
he found his queen sitting on a rock</i>

29:41.760 --> 29:46.520
<i>in the arms of a human. A sailor.</i>

29:50.920 --> 29:55.560
It's been a long time.
I'm so glad we finally got here.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.320
<i>She says there's someone
in the house. A man! In my house!</i>

30:24.400 --> 30:27.360
<i>She has a lively imagination.
She lives in a world of her own.</i>

30:27.440 --> 30:29.920
<i>Susanne, for fuck's sake.
How many more times?</i>

30:31.120 --> 30:32.680
I think I need some air.

30:33.640 --> 30:34.880
We've only just arrived.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.360
<i>The mer-king's heart was broken.</i>

30:49.440 --> 30:52.480
<i>But luring sailors was in her nature.</i>

30:54.040 --> 30:56.280
<i>And no one can change their nature.</i>

31:19.520 --> 31:23.360
It's not that I don't want to...

31:23.440 --> 31:26.280
- It's just that...
- That's not why I brought you here.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.400
You know?
I just miss being close to you.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.920
Actually, you know,
I really need some air.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.280
I'm so sorry. I won't be long.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.640
<i>It's been empty for years.</i>

32:57.720 --> 33:00.720
<i>Actually,
we were just about to gut it.</i>

33:01.840 --> 33:03.680
<i>Is this how you remember it?</i>

33:04.840 --> 33:09.240
<i>No, not really.
It's very strange to be back.</i>

33:20.680 --> 33:23.280
<i>- This used to be my room.
- Really?</i>

33:24.080 --> 33:28.360
<i>We called it the Fox's Den.
Because of the wallpaper.</i>

34:01.080 --> 34:04.080
- You bastard!
- What?

34:05.560 --> 34:08.280
It's easier to go through
the things you tell me

34:08.360 --> 34:10.240
than the things you don't.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.200
- What are you talking about?
- I went home last year.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.120
I went to Denmark.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.960
You didn't think to put that up
on the wall?

34:18.040 --> 34:20.800
I didn't put it on the wall
because we didn't go to Denmark.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.160
We talked about it
but we didn't go because...

34:26.920 --> 34:31.720
We looked. We didn't go to Denmark
because the house isn't there.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.040
It's been knocked down.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.720
But that's just...

34:39.600 --> 34:41.440
I remember going.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.600
- Every detail of it.
- I'm sorry.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.520
I'm so sorry, but we didn't go.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.000
I get these vague bits of memories.

35:27.080 --> 35:32.200
These tiny glimpses
of things that actually happened.

35:33.880 --> 35:38.600
And then I get every single detail
of a trip I never took.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.080
That's some crazy shit.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.520
I know.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.320
- You do? Really?
- Yes.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.320
I just don't know what to believe.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.960
What are you saying?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.400
I don't know.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.760
<i>You know what you need?
Some new cool, kick ass music.</i>

37:15.240 --> 37:17.560
Owen. Hi.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.040
Hey.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.160
Do you like tattoos?

37:30.440 --> 37:34.200
- Do you have any?
- What? Why are you asking?

37:35.160 --> 37:39.720
Would you take those off?
Just take the gloves off, please.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.440
I'm not sure what we're doing here.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.360
Take those ridiculous things off,
please.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.160
I want to see your arms.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.880
OK. Are we playing some weird form
of strip poker, or...?

37:47.960 --> 37:51.120
Alright, I'm just gonna
come straight out and say it.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.720
Did we...?

37:57.160 --> 37:59.720
Just take the fucking gloves off,
please.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.800
Oh, thank God.

38:16.800 --> 38:22.600
No... I... I feel
so incredibly embarrassed right now.

38:22.680 --> 38:26.840
- Why?
- I thought we'd had sex.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.080
Whoa. Um...

38:34.960 --> 38:39.320
We haven't ever, ever. So...

38:42.640 --> 38:44.600
Slightly offended
by how relieved you look.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.800
But, you know.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.920
You know, it's hard sometimes
to know what's real up here.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.480
Or not. You know?

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
God, someone shoot me right now.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.600
What?!

39:51.400 --> 39:54.280
<i>Susanne, for fuck's sake.
How many more times?</i>

39:55.200 --> 39:59.200
<i>I won't do it ever again.
Please, don't go!</i>

40:00.160 --> 40:02.720
<i>- You can't change who you are.
- I can.</i>

40:21.040 --> 40:22.120
Who the fuck are you?

40:23.520 --> 40:25.760
If it isn't the woman
who can't remember.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.080
The Eastbourne Identity.

40:30.360 --> 40:34.480
Hey, Mum.
Hey, you. Are you being nice?

40:34.560 --> 40:35.880
Course I am.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.760
Hi, Jo.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.480
I've just come by
to get some clothes.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.400
Do you mind?
I think they're in the loft.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.160
Of course I don't mind.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.640
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.480
Hi. Uh... Nice to meet you.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.480
For the first time. Again.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.720
I hear you make me laugh.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.680
Well, for now,
he's just gonna play it safe

41:04.760 --> 41:06.640
and make us some tea.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.280
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.960
They are indeed.
I know it's early days yet.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.080
Oh dear.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.800
What?

41:32.880 --> 41:34.160
Just as I suspected,

41:34.240 --> 41:36.680
the drawer has gone back
to its well-ordered self.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.280
Last time I was here we had
quite a heated discussion.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.800
About drawers,
it's thrilling, obviously,

41:43.880 --> 41:45.360
and what they say about us.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.280
So, you don't like me,
and you judge me.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.880
No.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.920
I think you're awesome.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.200
Spoiler alert:
bit less keen on your husband.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.000
Do you still take milk?

42:10.880 --> 42:12.960
- No. Never.
- Is the right answer.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.080
Yeah. I think I put Rob on edge.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.800
It's just willy-waving.

42:20.440 --> 42:21.680
Best forgotten about.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.160
You know, my friend's mother

42:25.240 --> 42:27.440
lit one cigarette after another
her whole life,

42:27.520 --> 42:30.880
got Alzheimer's, completely forgot
she was a smoker.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.640
I'm still waiting
for you to make me laugh.

42:49.320 --> 42:52.120
You don't remember
the last time we met, do you?

43:00.760 --> 43:03.160
You don't remember what happened.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.120
Didn't think so.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.400
It's a shame.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.120
I have to...

43:42.160 --> 43:43.760
Oh God.

43:46.520 --> 43:49.200
Mum? Are you alright?

43:50.320 --> 43:51.760
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.080
Mum. Let me in.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.920
Oh, Sash, I'm OK.
You guys go ahead home.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.360
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll call you tonight.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.680
- OK. Well, love you.
- I love you, baby.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.760
<i>What if you're not the victim
in all this?</i>

44:14.720 --> 44:16.200
<i>Do you ever think about that?</i>

44:30.360 --> 44:32.720
<i>What if you're the fucking problem?</i>

45:14.920 --> 45:18.000
