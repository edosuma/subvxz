For some reason in my hometown,
being in an orchestra was a thing,

00:26.651 --> 00:28.945
so everyone made fun of me
because I played violin.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.032
-Violin is a hard instrument to learn.
-[Tan] It's very hard.

00:32.115 --> 00:36.536
I ended up good at it, and then I did
get to play first chair first violin,

00:36.619 --> 00:39.622
because the girl who was first chair
broke her arm.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.833
-How did she fall?
-I didn't do it.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.293

we've been to.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.274
Like it hasn't been touched
since 1872.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.776
Which is adorable.

It looked like something
out of a Western movie,

It was fascinating.

This week, we're gonna meet
Sean Van Meter. He is 18.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.288
He's nominated by his godmother
and number one fan, Lulu.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.623
I love the name Lulu.

02:03.706 --> 02:08.044
He lives with Lulu in Jefferson, Georgia.
He's a singer, songwriter, pianist.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.463
-He's like Beyoncé of Jefferson County.
-Yes.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.303
My name is Sean Van Meter,
and I am a singer, songwriter, pianist.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.641
I've been playing the piano
since I was 6 years old.

02:21.724 --> 02:26.271
I play classical music, country,
jazz, pop, blues.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.982
Everything all over the musical spectrum.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.776
-[Lulu] What song?
-"Fall in Love Every Day."

02:31.860 --> 02:32.861
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.197
I knew
that I would never have children.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.284
The second I held Sean, that was over.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.079
He's been my life for 18 years.
I love him so much.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.500
[Sean] Lulu helped raise me and take care
of me when my parents weren't able to.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.753
People ask who Lulu is to me.
She's my mom.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.298
[Lulu] From an early age,
I knew he had talent.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.925
So, I worked hard to nurture the talent,

02:56.009 --> 02:59.804
but private school didn't have
the capability of working with us.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.725
A virtual school offered him
the opportunity to hone his craft.

03:03.808 --> 03:08.980
[Sean] An online high school worked great,
but I didn't see my classmates a lot.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.857
I was alone most of the time.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.860
Let's figure out what you're gonna wear.
All right.

03:13.943 --> 03:18.239
Lulu books me just about all my shows,
she'll go through my set list

03:18.323 --> 03:20.074
and pick out each song.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.078
And she's been the one
who really molded my fashion sense.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.415
[Lulu] When Sean started playing,
he never would say anything.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.708
He'd sit there and play.

03:28.791 --> 03:32.211
So, I got him a jacket and had his name
embroidered on the back,

03:32.295 --> 03:36.174
so everybody would know what his name was.
It's his trademark now.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.093
When Sean's on-stage, he's the guy.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.471
He makes the audience
part of the show.

When Sean's off-stage...

03:45.516 --> 03:46.476
Double three!

03:46.559 --> 03:49.437
He's an introvert, shy,
doesn't talk to people.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.981
He doesn't have a lot of friendships,

03:52.065 --> 03:55.109
and the friendships that he has
are people my age,

03:55.193 --> 03:57.779
because that's the only people
he's around.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.657
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Sean Van Meter.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.325
Now that I am an adult,

04:02.408 --> 04:05.745
going to college
is a major step forward for me.

04:05.828 --> 04:09.832
I'll be around a lot of people
for the first time since middle school,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.252
and I'm nervous about that.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.798
[Lulu] College is about new experiences,
you meet new people, you find new friends.

04:16.881 --> 04:20.260
And that concerns me.
Is he prepared to be independent?

04:20.635 --> 04:21.761
Not at the moment.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.263
[Sean] I need the Fab 5 to help me,

04:23.346 --> 04:26.975
because this is gonna be
a big transition in my life

04:27.183 --> 04:29.936
and I just need help fitting in.

04:30.019 --> 04:34.607
So, Sean heads to college in a few weeks,
and he's moving into his own place.

04:34.691 --> 04:39.487
-He's going from home school to college?
-You're in charge of a bachelor pad.

the biggest performance of his life.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.995
It's nearly sold out. He is the headliner.
He's worked hard on this.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.013
-Yes. Yeah.
-Yeah?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.975
His parents handed him to me
when he was born,

12:06.058 --> 12:08.477
and I've done my best
to teach him what I knew.

12:08.894 --> 12:14.316
It means a lot to me, 'cause I'm adopted.
And I was handed to my mama.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.737
And just like you, she took me in,
and they raised me as their own

12:19.029 --> 12:20.406
and gave me everything.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.952
And so, I have a lot of respect for you
and what you've done for Sean.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.037
Sean raised me. He did.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.750
Piedmont College. Why that school
and how you're feeling?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.752
What I liked about Piedmont

12:33.836 --> 12:36.380
was how well everyone seemed to know
each other.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.300
The students all knew each other,
uh, they knew the professors.

12:39.383 --> 12:43.345
I kind of missed that, because
I did go to a brick-and-mortar school

12:43.429 --> 12:47.433
up until middle school.
And then going to high school,

12:47.516 --> 12:50.269
staying at home,
I missed that socialization.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.355
-You were home-schooled?
-I was. But it gets lonely.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.525
I'm excited to start this new chapter
somewhere else.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.069
How you feeling about your baby
leaving the nest?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.404
It's gonna be hard.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.449
I found this great spacey apartment
for him.

13:03.532 --> 13:07.077
About 25, 30 minutes down the road.
Close to school.

13:07.369 --> 13:12.291
And I'm hoping that that'll help with
the separation anxiety I'm having here.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.043
He has a safe place to come home to.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.670
He's got a safe place,
but more importantly,

13:16.754 --> 13:19.882
he can be his own person,
and be the man he's becoming.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.509
I found your cards.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.678
-The real Sean Van Meter.
-Yeah. That's what--

13:24.762 --> 13:28.474
It's what I wanna be, it's what
I want people to think of me.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.101
But you don't know
who the real Sean Van Meter is yet?

13:31.185 --> 13:33.312
I'm trying to figure it out.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.439
[Karamo] We've lost Sean's voice.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.691
When you're with people
who are older than you,

13:37.775 --> 13:40.486
you don't get to assert your opinions
the same way you would

13:40.569 --> 13:44.448
with your own peers. We gotta get him
around people his own age.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.494
I want Sean to take us over to
the new place, so we can check that out.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.539
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-We're going investigating.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.833
[Karamo] Where do you hang out here?

13:54.917 --> 13:59.255
Oh, well, you know, I, um, hang out
at my house a lot, play music.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.507
What if you wanna go see a movie?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.551
I mean, there's a movie theater.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.387
Where? Show me the receipts.
I don't see anything.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.848
I can relate. The town I grew up in
didn't have anything.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.351
[Jonathan]
Which one is your apartment? Like, where?

14:12.434 --> 14:15.229
-[Sean] It's this one on the right.
-This red building.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.814
Cute.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.857
[Bobby] This new apartment
is so important.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.110
Sean needs a place for entertaining,

14:21.193 --> 14:24.989
bringing friends over
and finding that group of core people.

14:25.072 --> 14:25.906
After you.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.952
[Jonathan] Nice of you, Bobby.
Now, mind the gap, boys.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.081
-[Bobby] I love a nice raw space.
-[Antoni] Cool.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.249
[Jonathan] It's so raw.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.918
[Bobby] How old is this building?
Do you know?

14:38.002 --> 14:41.130
Um, it's been here
about a hundred years. Yes.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.426
-[Karamo] This is your future home.
-I'll miss the luxuries of living at home,

14:45.509 --> 14:48.345
having someone cook,
do the dishes, the laundry.

14:48.429 --> 14:52.141
But it's worth it to be able
to have the rule of the roost.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.268
You're ready to spread
those wings.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.978
I'm really excited.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.356
At the end of this week, I'm gonna be
playing at a cool venue in Athens

14:59.440 --> 15:02.735
called The Foundry,
and I want them to see the new Sean.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.236
-Awesome.
-Good job.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.572
Once we're done,
you'll feel confident.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.742
-Are you ready to get this week started?
-[Sean] Absolutely.

15:09.825 --> 15:13.078
No, I need more energy.
You got boots on, you are young.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.748
-This week is gonna be peachy.
-Yeah!

15:15.831 --> 15:18.375
I love it! Let's get this party started.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.348
[Jonathan] I begged to be home-schooled,
it was not gonna happen.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.891
In Sean's case, it did happen.

15:33.974 --> 15:37.603
I think that's impeded his ability
to connect with people

15:37.686 --> 15:41.815
for the last seven, eight years.
He's getting a crash course in people.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.859
There's five gay guys
giving you life.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.863
[Tan] I don't wanna be Lulu
and convince him to dress a certain way.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.991
I wanna collaborate
to create a look he loves.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.535
And I want it to be very much him.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.789
The thing that I want Sean to understand

15:56.872 --> 15:59.583
is that some people blossom
after high school.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.962
You go off to college,
you get out into the real world,

16:03.045 --> 16:06.048
and you just become the man or woman
you want to be.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.133
That's when life truly happens.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.052
This is a huge step for Sean.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.221
When you see good taste around you,

16:12.304 --> 16:15.099
it helps you evolve
your own good taste as well.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.977
So, I wanna incorporate clean,
modern pieces,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.979
but also make it industrial.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.439
[Antoni] With Sean,
I really wanna plant the idea

16:22.523 --> 16:25.943
of learning something at its most basic,
fundamental level,

16:26.026 --> 16:29.321
and how he can make that his own.
Because he's gonna be on his own.

16:29.405 --> 16:33.283
Unless Lulu brings him meals,
which I wouldn't put it past her.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.673
Do you think you're good at what you do?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.426
I mean, I think I'm all right at it.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.594
Oh, that was a test.

16:52.678 --> 16:56.765
I just need to get to the point
where you know that you're great.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.977
So, therefore, you don't have to wear
all of that garb

17:00.060 --> 17:01.562
to make yourself seem confident,

17:01.645 --> 17:03.564
you naturally
will have the confidence.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.482
-That sounds great to me.
-Good.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.817
Ready to try some stuff on?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.193
-Absolutely.
-Good.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.238
You have been wearing tuxes and blazers,

17:11.780 --> 17:16.452
and just because you're sat behind a piano
doesn't mean you have to be in tails.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.954
So, I'm gonna give you a bomber jacket.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.248
A simple black tee
to go underneath.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.583
Keep this one classic.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.543
You can be the one that looks super cool.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.545
-Do you know who John Legend is?
-Yeah.

17:26.628 --> 17:31.467
Okay, the music's beautiful,
his voice is beautiful, but he looks hip.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.803
People wanna get to know him,
he's relatable.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.972
I want you to be relatable
to every generation,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.807
not just an older generation.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.062
So, your trouser is gonna have
a racer stripe on the side.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.522
-Okay.
-Let me get you to try on the tee

17:45.606 --> 17:47.232
and the trousers first.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.609
All right.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.320
I want him to understand
one cohesive look.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.824
It will make you look youthful
but a little bit dressed up.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.867
Yeah.

17:56.950 --> 18:01.330
He can go from school to the mall,
the stage, from morning to evening,

18:01.413 --> 18:04.124
and he feels fantastic,
and he looks fantastic.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.876
Look at that guy in the mirror.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.464
I want you to do me a favor.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.133
Loosen up, shake, just shake for me.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.345
Physically shake, let it go, let it go.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.350
And now look at yourself,
because you're turning like this.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.561
I want you to have swag,
you're young and attractive.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.773
-Like "swag" swag. There you go.
-All right, got swag.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.652
When I look at him look in the mirror,
I see confidence I've not seen before.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.154
There you go. Tell me how you're feeling.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.032
Do you feel like it's something
you could wear?

18:37.116 --> 18:40.202
I do. It's kind of classy,
but, like, not so classy

18:40.285 --> 18:42.412
-you couldn't wear it day to day.
-Good.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.333
I've never done the stripe before,
but I could get used to it.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.962
It's classic, but it's age appropriate.
This look isn't wearing you.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.590
Try this on for me.
Put these jeans with this shirt, yeah.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.301
I want him to feel young
and cool and hip.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.804
All right, all right.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.597
Okay, okay, okay.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.434
What I wanna do,
instead of wearing the blazer jazzy,

19:04.518 --> 19:06.436
I'm gonna have a brighter shirt
underneath.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.981
-All right.
-And keep the blazer classic.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.692
So, it's still very much
what you had before,

19:11.775 --> 19:15.070
but just a very contemporary,
cool version.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.866
The way he's responding to these looks,
the way he carries himself in these,

19:18.949 --> 19:21.451
there's a shift in confidence, in comfort.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.620
Yeah, I would go out in this, yeah.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.456
-I would, um--
-Uh, yeah, yeah, mate.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.457
Tantastic.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.086
[laughs] Check you out.
All right, I'll go for that.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.134
When did you discover
you wanted to be a singer?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.802
When I was about 10.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.139
That's when I played
in my first band, and I had--

19:42.222 --> 19:45.100
-What was the name of the band?
-Death of the Peanut King.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.560
[laughing]

19:46.894 --> 19:49.396
That sounds like the name
of a 10-year-old group.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.941
That was the first time I'd ever had
any experience being a front man

19:53.025 --> 19:54.526
and doing a lot of singing.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.529
Before that, I mostly played
instrumental music

19:57.613 --> 20:00.699
and had never worked
with other musicians before.

20:00.782 --> 20:03.619
-But that's--
-Working with other people is hard.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.916
No it's not. It's not hard.
What are your interests outside of music?

20:08.999 --> 20:12.878
You know, there aren't a ton.
Uh, lasers, I really like lasers.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.840
[Karamo] Like shooting laser beams or...?

20:17.674 --> 20:22.262
Uh, yeah, I like to go outside at night
and just see the beams in the sky.

20:23.096 --> 20:23.931
Um...

20:25.599 --> 20:27.017
Where do I start with that?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.977
No, there's no possible way.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.395
[chuckles]

20:30.646 --> 20:34.441
We are complex human beings,
and there are things we love to do.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.151
Do you like to swim?

20:36.693 --> 20:39.196
-I do. I do.
-[Karamo] Okay, there goes an interest.

20:39.863 --> 20:43.700
-Uh... Do you like to play video games?
-Yeah.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.078
There goes another.
Help me out here.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.248
I'm trying to figure out
what do you like to do.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.667
Okay, um, I like to read books.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.168
-Okay, books.
-Um...

20:58.715 --> 21:00.968
Listen, I know it's hard,

21:01.051 --> 21:04.179
Normally, these conversations
would happen organically

21:04.263 --> 21:05.847
when you were with other kids.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.600
They would say,
"Hey, do you wanna skip rope?"

21:08.684 --> 21:10.560
You would be like,
"I love skipping rope,"

21:10.644 --> 21:12.437
or "No, I've never tried."

21:12.521 --> 21:15.691
You'd know
skipping rope is something I like to do.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.569
That's all about how you socialize
and how you find your tribe.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.447
Friends who have
the same interests as you.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.324
Friends who love what you love

21:24.408 --> 21:28.745
outside of just music...

21:28.829 --> 21:31.748
-And laser beams.
-And laser beams. Exactly.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.753
We are here.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.425
Oh!

21:41.508 --> 21:44.511
-Now you're getting me excited.
-Now you're excited?

21:44.594 --> 21:46.972
Didn't think homos
would take you out shooting guns?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.849
-It's classic paintball.
-[laughing]

21:48.932 --> 21:51.935
[Karamo] I want Sean to be a kid again.
Have fun.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.937
What better way to loosen him up

21:54.021 --> 21:57.232
and hang with other kids
his own age than paintball?

21:57.607 --> 22:00.777
Now, I wouldn't paintball in this.
Do you see this outfit?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.404
-Yes, yes, we do.
-Okay.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.205
Just remember, just shake it up
and have a good time,

22:12.289 --> 22:13.623
and remember your age.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.460
[man] At the end of the day,
if you hadn't been shot,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.920
-you haven't played paintball.
-[laughs]

22:19.671 --> 22:23.008
And y'all have a great time.
I hope you make some friends

22:23.091 --> 22:25.385
and not enemies while you're here.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.470
Thank you.

22:26.553 --> 22:30.223
You know, this is about you
obviously making new friends.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.852
There is a group of people over here.
Do a little small talk,

22:34.102 --> 22:37.856
and hopefully, that leads to us
having people to hang with us.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.612
-Hey. How you guys doing?
-Doing good, how are you?

22:43.695 --> 22:47.157
I was just noticing,
I love your hair cut, man, really hip.

22:49.951 --> 22:50.786
Okay.

22:50.869 --> 22:54.081
I love your sweater.
Green, it's my favorite color.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.085
-What's your name?
-Travis.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.003
Nice to meet you, I'm Sean.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.173
Sean's a musician.
He practices all the time.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.759
He's been out of practice
when it comes to socializing.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.469
-I like your shoes. I have
-Thanks.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.930
a collection of Converse. That and Vans.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.141
All right, nice. I like Converse, too.
I'm Sean.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.935
-Victoria.
-Nice to meet you.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.603
-Nice to meet you.
-How do you feel

23:16.686 --> 23:18.105
about playing paintball
with us?

23:18.188 --> 23:20.023
-Yeah, definitely.
-Yeah? Awesome.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.900
Yes.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.779
I'm super competitive.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.824
I might have to show these kids
that the old man's still got it.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.368
We're gonna split up into teams.

23:31.451 --> 23:36.039
Object of the game is to touch the other
opponents' base without getting shot.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.791
[horn honking]

23:39.793 --> 23:40.794
[Karamo shouts]

23:42.045 --> 23:44.506
[Karamo] I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!
[shouts]

23:44.756 --> 23:46.633
There's a kid that lives in all of us.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.303
Some high-pressure guns.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.933
When you're 18,
you're not that far removed from that kid.

23:55.016 --> 23:58.895
-[Sean] We got one from the left.
-Shake off all of that old guy stuff.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.772
You're young, you're fresh.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.649
You're confident.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.318
You are a cool kid.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.779
[shouting]

24:07.863 --> 24:09.573
[horn honking]

24:09.656 --> 24:11.158
[Karamo] Victory!

24:13.827 --> 24:15.036
I almost had him, man.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.038
[Sean] I know. That was a good game.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.542
Congratulations to me and my team
for being victorious.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.921
Give us a round of applause.
Thank you, we deserve that.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.966
This is the first time
I'm not getting one of those

24:28.049 --> 24:32.762
fake I-hang-around-old-people smile.
Like, he's giving me genuine happiness.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.432
He's starting to realize
he's a normal kid.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.392
-You look familiar, man.
-Yeah?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.895
-You look familiar.
-I like to hear that.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.813
Wanna hear that everywhere someday.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.691
I'm like a proud daddy,
looking at my baby bird

24:44.774 --> 24:47.527
off in the world,
chirping his way through life.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
-[Sean] Glad you made it here today.
-[Victoria] You're not leaving.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.157
-[Karamo] Wanna play another one?
-Yeah.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.074
Let's go.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.669
-Hey. What you doing?
-Hi, Lulu.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.838
-I'm painting.
-I can see.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.424
-Oh, my.
-Thank you for accepting my invitation.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.384
Oh, thank you for inviting me.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.221
Nothing can move forward in Sean's life
without Lulu.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.223
Oh, wow, this is nice paint.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.349
-Right?
-Yeah.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.267
We're gonna do a kitchen here.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.771
-Okay.
-And then I'm thinking a living room here.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.522
-Okay.
-Dining room here.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.566
And then, back there, bedroom.

25:26.650 --> 25:31.238
Sean's never even spent the night
away from Lulu his whole life.

25:31.571 --> 25:35.325
And now, he's moving into his own space.
That's a lot for Lulu.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.952
How are you feeling?

25:37.035 --> 25:39.871
Uh, anxious, nervous, sad, happy.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.415
Those are all good emotions.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.795
As much as I don't want him to go,
I'm excited about having space of his own.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.965
Having a space of your own
is important, you know?

25:50.090 --> 25:54.803
Just having alone time to figure out you.

25:55.929 --> 25:59.391
You know, I just hope
he becomes what he wants to be.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.602
Not what I want him to be
or what anybody--

26:02.686 --> 26:05.021
I want Sean to be what he wants to be.

26:05.146 --> 26:08.942
And I think the key to that
is me letting go.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.488
You think he's gonna miss me, right?

26:13.571 --> 26:16.157
-Clearly.
-Okay. [laughs]

26:22.789 --> 26:25.500
-Are you guys from Georgia?
-I'm currently in school.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.919
-[Antoni] What are you studying?
-Communications.

26:28.003 --> 26:31.006
The clock's ticking.
Sean's starting college in a week.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.009
He didn't have the standard
high-school upbringing

26:34.092 --> 26:36.594
where you're in a room with kids your age.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.389
The sooner we get him into
a classroom setting, the better.

26:39.973 --> 26:43.310
So, welcome, everybody,
to a little 101 class in cooking.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.520
I wanna teach you
how to make a French omelet.

26:45.603 --> 26:46.646
Yes!

26:47.439 --> 26:49.733
[Antoni] Sean knows nothing about cooking.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.651
Basics are where we need to start.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.695
Butter, flour, eggs.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.072
You gotta learn those rules
before you break them.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.743
To start off, put the burner on
as low as it will go.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.995
Is it gonna get as hot as you are?

27:02.078 --> 27:04.080
-Inappropriate.
-They're all thinking it.

27:05.457 --> 27:10.211
And then we wanna take a generous
tablespoon of butter, coat the entire pan.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.006
We have chives. Chop them finely.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.593
-Crack an egg.
-Very, very quick.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.636
-Be assertive with your egg.
-Yes.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.389
We wanna break them up.
You don't want chunks.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.685
It's coming down almost like water.
We're gonna season with kosher salt.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.520
So, you pour it in.

27:27.604 --> 27:31.066
And you take chopsticks,
and we mix them around in the pan.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.901
We wanna have a small curdle.

27:33.109 --> 27:35.737
When I use a spatula,
it has a larger curdle,

27:35.820 --> 27:39.657
and we want these to be delicate.
This is cooking really quickly.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.453
And now, with the rubber spatula,
fold them over lightly like so.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.540
There you go. Okay, guys.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.084
Pair up, two by two.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.044
You each have your station.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.505
-Wanna be partners? Let's do it.
-[Sean] Sure.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.006
I was paying attention.

27:55.090 --> 27:59.386
-Can we start, teacher?
-On your marks, set, cook.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.680
Let's do a massive omelet
and do all the eggs.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.518
[woman] Is that a chive?

28:06.601 --> 28:09.396
-Yeah, cut it with a knife.
-It'll be all right.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.272
Oh, are we supposed to season?

28:12.774 --> 28:14.776
-All right.
-Just add the salt at the end.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.945
Cooking doesn't have to be complicated.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.156
Is it meant to look
like cottage cheese, chef?

28:20.698 --> 28:23.368
Very good, very good.
Beautiful, I like it.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.870
-It looks good.
-That's kind of folded.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.748
It forces Sean to communicate,
to ask questions.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.834
-Is that our plate?
-Right here.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.086
To work with somebody,
creating something.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.712
Very successful.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.800
[woman] You're gonna be a freshman?
I'm starting at UG in a week.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.510
Okay, congratulations.

28:40.593 --> 28:41.511
Thanks.

28:41.594 --> 28:46.266
Yeah, Sean is just like this bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed little baby bunny rabbit

28:46.349 --> 28:47.600
shedding off the baby coat.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.019
-What are you studying?
-Nutritional science.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.646
-Oh, okay.
-Mm-hm.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.940
So, this will be the first
cooking class of many.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.151
-Yes.
-[Jonathan] And they were just talking

28:56.234 --> 28:58.737
and teamwork-ing
and doing the cute stuff.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.030
He's totally feeling better
about himself.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.451
We weren't selfish like you.
We made enough for everyone.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.828
So, are you grading it?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.872
-Oh, yeah.
-I'll be the judge of that.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.039
[Antoni] This is beautiful.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.126
-Celebrity guest judges.
-[Antoni] Right amount of salt.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.463
Okay, that was really good.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.382
This one's a little more yellow.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.718
That one's really good.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.137
This one's cute. It's a little rustic.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.932
It's missing a bit of salt.

29:29.017 --> 29:29.851
Oh, my.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.436
We made a 12-egg omelet.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.105
Tan and I are the worst.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.610
But we had so much fun.
So, thanks for having us.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.863
It's actually super close.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.240
Sean, love you,
but we have plenty to learn.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.619
Jason put just the right amount
of kosher salt in there.

29:47.702 --> 29:52.290
-And for that reason, Jason wins.
-Yes!

29:53.082 --> 29:54.793
-That was beautiful.
-Good job!

29:54.876 --> 29:57.879
It's about learning
how to make it his own.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.048
Sean is a little less intimidated

30:00.131 --> 30:02.550
and a little more motivated
going away to college.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.344
He's excited, which is great.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.221
It's time for us to go to the salon.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.722
-Are you ready?
-I'm very ready.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.600
All right, well, let's blow
this Popsicle stand.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.811
-Come with me. Bye.
-Come on, buddy.

30:18.733 --> 30:22.862
This is my favorite salon, Dragonfly.
I love it here. Come on back.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.073
My station's back here.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.324
Are you nervous?

30:26.825 --> 30:30.245
-Mostly excited.
-Good. I'm excited for you to be excited.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.413
Sean is in an image-heavy industry.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.208
When you throw away your look
to the first available person,

30:35.291 --> 30:38.336
and you don't invest in that,
that can be an issue.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.630
That's how you turn out
with a Scooby-Doo haircut.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.841
I wanna just de-hair-ify you.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.301
I'm gonna take these sides off
and take this back off

30:45.385 --> 30:48.054
and maybe have this top live more
out of your face.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.138
You know what I mean?

30:49.222 --> 30:53.309
-Yeah. Mm-hm.
-I feel like it'll be sexier and younger.

30:53.393 --> 30:57.480
And also, too,
I am not digging this facial hair.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.650
In two years, in three, five,
seven years maybe,

31:00.733 --> 31:03.653
when these islands connect, beard out.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.739
Grooming isn't like you get one look
and that has to be forever.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.409
It can be fun, and you don't
always have to do one thing.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.160
I'm so excited to change it up.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.205
I wanna take Sean
from a prepubescent Justin Bieber

31:14.289 --> 31:17.041
into, like, a world-tour Purpose Biebs,

31:17.125 --> 31:19.085
except for one that didn't get canceled.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.504
♪ Hey, boy, what are you waiting for? ♪

31:23.423 --> 31:26.467
Your eyes gonna be popping.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.512
Sean is so ready
for this next chapter.

31:29.596 --> 31:33.725
I feel like he's got a little more soul.
He's got more polished moments

31:33.808 --> 31:36.102
with the little bit
of ruffled texture moments.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.314
I can hear the girls
chasing you already.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.109
I feel like he's ready
to just jump off this cliff

31:43.192 --> 31:45.695
and spread those wings and fly, honey.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.865
It shows off your face so much.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.702
-You can still jam with it, which I love.
-That's right.

31:53.578 --> 31:57.373
-What do you think?
-Different and cool, yeah. I like it.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.834
Feel your hair like someone who feels it.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.338
Yes, like, and get--
Give me a little like sexy, like--

32:03.963 --> 32:07.592
Like, photoshoot hair.
Like, give me, like-- Yeah, both hands.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.886
Give me a little face when you do it.

32:09.969 --> 32:13.723
Yes. That's what I'm talking about.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.183
You just owned that.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.747
[Bobby] I think I hear Lulu, guys.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.249
I just show the guy
who's gonna live here

32:40.333 --> 32:42.460
but Lulu's the person who loves him most.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.588
I wanna give her the assurance
that Sean's gonna be okay.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.132
-You brought cookies.
-I did.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.177
-Come on in. Come in. Come in. Come in.
-[laughing]

32:51.469 --> 32:54.055
Oh, my God.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.350
-Let me get the cookies.
-And these are for you.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.980
-Oh, my gosh!
-You like it?

33:04.649 --> 33:05.608
That's gold.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.527
I love that Lulu.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.320
Isn't it crazy?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.406
Lulu with her emotions.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.492
Yeah, can't get enough.

33:15.034 --> 33:19.080
I was going through all this anxiety,
you know, starting college,

33:19.163 --> 33:23.751
and, you know, being with him
every single minute, and just everything.

33:24.085 --> 33:29.799
And seriously, when I walked in the door
and saw the space--

33:29.882 --> 33:34.679
Seriously, when I saw the space,
it was just all gone.

33:34.762 --> 33:37.765
-Aw...
-I know he's gonna be okay.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.768
I know when I get a good tear, it's legit.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.230
-I'm gonna go away, I guess.
-Yeah.

33:44.647 --> 33:48.901
I kind of want Sean to have the same
overwhelming moment that I just had.

33:48.985 --> 33:52.655
-Before you go, I got flowers for you.
-Yay.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.407
Thank you all so much.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.409
-Thank y'all, it's beautiful.
-Thank you.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.744
-Thank you, bye.
-Bye.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.412
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.706
-Oh, she's so sweet, I can't...
-Love.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.542

with this look--

34:12.842 --> 34:14.135
That's what I was saying.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.596
People are gonna say,
"You look killer."

34:16.679 --> 34:18.514
You're gonna have a great time.

34:18.598 --> 34:22.935
When you start inviting people
back to this house, wait till you see it.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.647
-You're really gonna be like, wow.
-I'm so ready, 100 percent.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.029
-Okay, okay.
-Get excited.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.131
[Bobby] Is it you?

34:52.298 --> 34:56.677
Yes. It's like a whole side of me
I never knew I had until now.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.387
[all laughing]

34:58.471 --> 35:01.265
-I really love this.
-Take it in. It's a lot.

35:01.349 --> 35:05.686
[Bobby] So, I did more of an industrial
modern, with bar stools, sleek uplighting.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.523
And mixed it in
with more industrial pieces.

35:08.606 --> 35:12.610
[Sean] It's sophisticated, but it's not
too cluttered, which I love. It's simple.

35:12.693 --> 35:16.114
-I'm in love with this table.
-I've never seen you smile this much.

35:16.197 --> 35:19.242
You have been laughing
and smiling so much.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.368
[Sean] I am.

35:21.869 --> 35:24.497
It's perfect. It's just perfect.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.582
-Thank you.
-Of course, thank you.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.085
I hope this gives you
the confidence you need.

35:29.168 --> 35:32.630
Take a seat with me.
This is a very big week for you.

35:32.713 --> 35:36.050
-Yeah.
-I can see a different change in you.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.054
Every time you smile.
Do that for the rest of your life.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.140
I mean, you just seem happy.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.600
It's not that I wasn't happy before,

35:44.684 --> 35:48.312
but I think
it really opened my mind a lot.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.523
As long as you know who you are,

35:50.606 --> 35:53.192
and you believe in yourself,
then it's okay.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.820
Whatever life throws at you,
you can handle.

35:55.903 --> 35:59.657
Knowing that has brought me
to a whole new level of happiness.

35:59.740 --> 36:03.327
Good. So, the real Sean Van Meter
is confident,

36:03.703 --> 36:06.455
and he's young, and he's ready for life.

-Yeah.
-I feel that from you now.

36:08.624 --> 36:11.252
Thank you so much. Thank you. Come here.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.879
Thank you.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.593
I wanted to get to the point
where we've got one Sean Van Meter

36:18.718 --> 36:21.762
who looks great in the daytime
and can throw on a jacket

36:21.846 --> 36:24.932
or change out just a shirt,
and then he looks amazing for on-stage.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.810
So, that's what we've got here.
I love some of your old stuff,

36:27.894 --> 36:29.562
but don't wear it the way
you were.

36:29.645 --> 36:34.150
You can wear a button-up shirt and one
of your jackets, that's good enough.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.610
-I like these.
-Good.

36:36.194 --> 36:41.282
Footwear. I didn't wanna take away
the full-on crazy stuff,

36:41.365 --> 36:43.117
so I got you one color.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.661
It's black. It's a simple color.

36:45.745 --> 36:48.414
And it can just be the showpiece itself.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.126
I wanna get to the point
where you feel comfortable enough

36:52.210 --> 36:57.048
to use your style as a conversation
starter to help gain new friends.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.466
Speaking of friends...

36:59.675 --> 37:01.510
tell me about this group.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.139
[Sean] That was my very first band,
Death of the Peanut King.

37:05.306 --> 37:09.101
They're a year or two older.
I don't see them as much as I did.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.854
-Are they enjoying school?
-Yes, they are.

37:11.938 --> 37:16.192
Good, so I hope that gives you hope
that you'll have the best time there.

37:16.567 --> 37:20.905
You know, I was scared a week ago,
and now that's all gone.

37:20.988 --> 37:24.242
-Good.
-I owe that to you guys and to this week.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.828
-Let's try on some clothes. You ready?
-Yeah, absolutely.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.746
Okay, good.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.042
-Will you try those on?
-Absolutely.

-Head on your way, thank you.

It's literally like sophisticated you.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.869
-Yeah.
-Great jacket. That's like a staple piece.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.122
It's a great thing
to wear on-stage,

38:11.205 --> 38:14.709
it looks slick and cool and young,
but it's also timeless.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.420
You can wear it till you're 50
and look great.

Hello. Yeah, the fit of that shirt
is fabulous.

and I feel so much better for it.
