WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:07.175
What are you guys doing?

00:07.208 --> 00:09.110
I thought you were
taking Hope to the park.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.244
It's too hot.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.313
I can't believe
you guys are so lazy.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.815
We're not lazy; we just...

00:14.848 --> 00:17.551
I don't have the energy
to argue with you.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.420
She's having fun.
We did this kind of stuff

00:19.453 --> 00:21.189
with you,
and you loved it.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.224
It's smart parenting.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.259
Like, why would you drag a tent
out to the forest

00:25.293 --> 00:26.427
when you can build one
with blankets

00:26.460 --> 00:27.695
in your own living room?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.497
Can I come out now?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.365
Not yet, buddy.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.367
Daddy's still
fighting the bear.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.436
(growls)

00:35.469 --> 00:37.438
VIRGINIA:
And why spend all day

00:37.471 --> 00:39.540
standing in lines at the museum
when we've got

00:39.573 --> 00:41.442
plenty of old stuff
right here in the house?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.244
And this is what ladies

00:43.277 --> 00:45.213
used to wear in
the '40s and '50s.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.182
They had no sense of style
like we do today.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.085
Or when you wanted
to take karate,

00:51.119 --> 00:52.386
but it would've been
a hassle to drive

00:52.420 --> 00:54.122
two towns over to where
they held the classes.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.424
Okay, grasshopper.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.392
Time for your
kung fu lesson.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.861
Whatever that guy
in the black pajamas does,

01:00.894 --> 01:03.097
you do the same,
all right?

01:04.265 --> 01:07.501
You want to fight, fight me.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.338
You want to fight?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.441
Fight me.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.576
Look, if you want to call that
"smart parenting"

01:15.609 --> 01:18.212
to make yourselves feel better,
that's fine,

01:18.246 --> 01:20.381
but Hope is not going
to grow up that way.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.483
I am taking her to a park

01:22.516 --> 01:26.120
so she can have an actual
outdoor experience in nature.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.293
Hot out there, huh?

01:32.326 --> 01:33.627
And muggy.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.096
I wasn't expecting the muggy.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.233
Whoo!

01:39.267 --> 01:40.234
* Here we go

01:40.268 --> 01:43.504
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:43.537 --> 01:45.306
Are you sure you can do this?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.608
Piece of cake. Don't move.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.577
Don't hit my face.
Don't move.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.280
Don't hit my face.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.481
I don't know what
you guys are doing,

01:53.514 --> 01:54.415
but Hope wants
to go on the swing.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.150
Oh, hold on.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.318
I'm dying to know
if I can do this.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.486
Don't hit my face.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.920
All right.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.522
Coming at you.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.429
(grunts)

02:08.462 --> 02:09.297
It's okay, sweetie.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.798
Burt, go grab
a dustpan, would you?

02:10.831 --> 02:13.367
Just a picture of your dad
when he was a baby.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.369
I'm sure we can find another one
around here somewhere.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.271
Here, have a seat.

02:17.305 --> 02:20.274
I really was cute as a baby.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.344
Oh, look at you.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.346
So cute and happy
and thinking

02:25.379 --> 02:26.447
life's going to turn out great.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.249
Good for you.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.319
Hey, it's... it's folded.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.454
There's more picture.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.357
Who are these people?
I have no idea.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.292
Uh, that picture
came with the frame.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.328
But how did I get in the picture
that comes with the frame?

02:40.361 --> 02:43.231
Okay, we were never
going to tell you this,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.566
but, uh, when you
were little,

02:45.599 --> 02:48.336
I took you to
a baby modeling tryout

02:48.369 --> 02:50.404
and you got the job
to be in that picture.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.640
But then I saw
a special on TV

02:52.673 --> 02:55.243
about Danny Bonaduce,
and it scared me,

02:55.276 --> 02:56.544
so I never took you back.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.379
But you love Danny Bonaduce.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.713
The actor, not the person.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.250
Don't turn around
or say anything.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.318
Dad, who are the people
in this picture?

03:04.352 --> 03:06.354
That is me and your mother.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.821
Really?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.490
We were never
going to tell you this,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.525
but, uh, your mom and I
used to be spies.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.394
That's what we
used to look like

03:13.427 --> 03:14.495
before we retired
and the government

03:14.528 --> 03:16.497
gave us new faces.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.866
That, uh, older boy is a robot--
ran on "C" batteries.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.434
He's not buying it, Burt.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.270
Ah, damn.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.504
I told you we should have thrown
that picture away.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.373
But Jimmy looked
so adorable,

03:25.406 --> 03:26.707
and we couldn't afford
a little sailor suit.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.442
So, who are these people?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.444
Besides, you were supposed
to cut the other people

03:30.478 --> 03:33.347
out of the picture,
not fold them behind.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.749
Cutting a picture
is bad luck.
Says who?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.618
I don't know. People.
Isn't that a thing?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.353
Why am I in this picture?

03:39.387 --> 03:40.421
No, that's not a thing.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.755
You know what's bad luck?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.357
Folding a picture

03:43.391 --> 03:45.459
instead of cutting it,
and then 25 years later,

03:45.493 --> 03:47.795
having to explain to your son
that he's adopted.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.430
What?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.931
You have a good point.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.633
I guess folding is worse.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.502
Live and learn.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.376
I'm adopted?
Before you get mad,

04:02.410 --> 04:04.945
just give us a
chance to explain.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.783
You're not
that kind of adopted.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.586
We are your
biodegradable parents.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.322
Well, but then who
are these people?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.589
They're Bill
and Denise Jenkins,

04:15.623 --> 04:17.891
and they adopted you from us.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.461
(baby crying)
When you were born,
we weren't really prepared

04:20.494 --> 04:23.431
for the impact it was going
to have on our leisure time.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.366
(cartoon volume rising)

04:30.371 --> 04:32.606
(wailing)

04:32.640 --> 04:34.375
It was a nightmare.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.743
You were a nightmare child.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.511
You know that movie
The Exorcist?

04:37.545 --> 04:40.080
You cried the whole way
through it.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.582
That's the thing
about babies, Jimmy.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.485
They don't come with
an instruction manual.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.419
Someone really
should write a book

04:45.453 --> 04:46.787
about how to
care for a baby.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.456
So we did
what we thought

04:48.489 --> 04:49.523
was the responsible
thing to do

04:49.557 --> 04:52.626
and had an adoption agency
find you a better home.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.429
But after a few weeks, we kind
of missed having you around.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.365
Plus, with you gone,
we lost our little excuse

04:57.398 --> 04:58.432
for not doing our homework.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.733
So we got you back.

05:01.569 --> 05:06.807
Are you maybe a little mad
that we kind of...

05:06.840 --> 05:10.511
sort of tried to pretend
you never happened?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.980
No, I'm not.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.848
I mean, I get it.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.784
I had the same thought
when I first had Hope.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.486
I was just a
little bit older,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.854
and I was lucky 'cause I
had you guys to help me.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.523
I just can't stop wondering

05:22.556 --> 05:25.393
what it would have been like
to not be an only child.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.495
I always wanted a brother.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.431
So I invented one: Johnny.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.666
Want to do some math problems
while we wait?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.734
Okay.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.636
Three plus four.
Nine.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.371
Right. Six plus eight.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.473
200.
Correct.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.841
You're a genius, Jimmy.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.543
Thanks, Johnny.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.413
And all this time,
I did have a big brother.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.847
Almost.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.551
I was Chad, and he was Brad.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.386
Brad.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.389
I'm going to go under my bed
and tell Johnny about this.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.932
(sighs)

06:06.767 --> 06:08.936
He took that
really well.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.671
Should we tell him
some of the bigger stuff?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.940
You mean like when I realized
I'd never have a daughter,

06:12.973 --> 06:15.409
so I dressed him
like a girl for a month?

06:15.443 --> 06:16.944
I miss Jamie.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.413
Or when he ate a whole pack
of your cigarettes

06:19.447 --> 06:20.881
and his heart stopped
for a while?

06:23.617 --> 06:26.454
Nah, let's not tell him.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.589
There's usually
a couple good laughs when he

06:28.622 --> 06:29.957
figures these things out
on his own.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.596
Brad? Brad?

06:35.629 --> 06:36.864
Hey, Jimmy.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.499
Oh, you can stop
doing that.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.601
I found your almost-brother
on the Internet.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.769
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.036
That's him?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.805
I've seen his picture
on bus benches.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.939
Oh, my God.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.475
My almost-brother is famous.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.776
(button clicks)

06:51.545 --> 06:52.746
If you're looking for a house

06:52.780 --> 06:54.482
in Natesville,
Natesville-adjacent

06:54.515 --> 06:57.451
or just outside Natesville,
then come see me.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.887
I'm Brad Jenkins,
Real Estate Agent with the Hat.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.989
Not...

07:02.022 --> 07:04.525
the Real Estate Agent
with the Bat.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.496
Not the Real Estate Agent
with the Rat.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.764
And certainly not

07:10.798 --> 07:13.601
the Real Estate Agent
with the Flat.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.769
(air hissing)

07:25.679 --> 07:27.515
No, I'm Brad Jenkins,

07:27.548 --> 07:29.550
Real Estate Agent with the Hat.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.520
And I'm going to find you
your dream house

07:32.553 --> 07:35.623
because the only difference
between realty

07:35.656 --> 07:37.925
and reality is the "I."

07:37.958 --> 07:42.530
So, if you can find
a better deal on a home,

07:42.563 --> 07:45.633
I will eat my hat.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.366
VIRGINIA:
That's him?

07:46.399 --> 07:48.569
I've seen his ad
at the bus stop.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.670
He looks a lot better

07:49.703 --> 07:51.605
without the blacked-out teeth
and the devil horns.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.273
I made an appointment
with him for tomorrow.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.708
We're going to pretend
that we're selling

07:54.742 --> 07:56.877
Sabrina's grandmother's house.
Why?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.712
He was my brother for over
three weeks. I want to meet him.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.047
So just tell him
who you are

08:00.080 --> 08:01.515
and meet up for a
beer one night.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.983
Are you kidding?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.652
He's the Real Estate Agent
with the Hat.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.986
I bet someone's coming up
to him claiming

08:06.019 --> 08:07.688
to be his long-lost brother
like once a week.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.523
I just want to
hang out with him,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.058
see what he's like.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.161
The Real Estate Agent
with the Hat.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.564
Who would have guessed?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.666
That's what I need:
a gimmick.

08:18.699 --> 08:23.003
Burt Chance,
Landscaper with...

08:23.036 --> 08:26.006
Two... Watches.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.041
"I'll work double-time for you."

08:28.075 --> 08:30.578
I like it. Which one of
these buttons do you push

08:30.611 --> 08:32.580
to get one
of those Web sites?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.915
Try one of those on the top
with the little "F"s on them.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.685
They seem like they
do the tricky stuff.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.724
I was thinking,
just for fun,

08:43.757 --> 08:45.926
we should spice up our
cover story about who we are.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.596
Like, instead of being
a surgical laser salesman,

08:48.629 --> 08:51.599
you could be a NASCAR driver
and I could be a Southern belle.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.734
Uh, you know, I haven't...
I haven't, uh,

08:53.767 --> 08:54.702
traveled that much,
so I don't know

08:54.735 --> 08:56.069
if your accents are
any good, and I really

08:56.103 --> 08:57.571
want to make a great
first impression.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.573
So, just showing off
the fact that you eat

08:59.607 --> 09:00.708
your own eyebrows
when you're nervous

09:00.741 --> 09:02.075
is going to make
a perfect icebreaker.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.612
(doorbell rings)

09:05.646 --> 09:08.616
Oh, my God, it's really him.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.584
And he's wearing a hat.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.752
You must be Jimmy.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.654
Yes, I am.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.656
And, uh, this
is my fiancée...

09:15.689 --> 09:17.625
(Cockney accent): Bridget.
Pleasure to meet you, love.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.360
Hey, give us a holler
if you fancy a cup of tea

09:20.393 --> 09:21.862
or a crumpet or
perhaps a heap

09:21.895 --> 09:23.096
of fish and chips wrapped in

09:23.130 --> 09:24.732
last Saturday's
Evening Post, eh?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.667
Well, okay.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.870
(whistles)

09:29.903 --> 09:31.872
Dynamite house.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.608
Man, if this place had
a hat on its roof,

09:34.642 --> 09:36.276
it would sell itself.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.712
I'm just going to take
a look around

09:38.746 --> 09:40.280
and let you know what we can...

09:40.313 --> 09:42.082
cap our listing at.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.752
Man, you really work "hat"
into everything.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.654
It's what I do.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.758
Hey, what say me, you
and your fedorable fiancée

09:50.791 --> 09:54.294
take my chapeau on a tour
of your château?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.763
Ha!

09:55.796 --> 09:58.098
"Chapeau" means hat, right?

09:58.131 --> 09:59.767
Yeah.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.201
I love him.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.638
You think,
if we left Jimmy

10:04.672 --> 10:06.674
with that other family,
he would have been better off?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.275
Maybe he would have
his picture on that bench?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.412
Nah, Jimmy looks
horrible in hats.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.782
That's true.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.283
But there are lots of good jobs
where you don't need a hat.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.186
Can't think of any right now.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.689
Fireman, cowboy,
football player.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.191
I'm telling you,
all the good jobs have hats.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.993
I just hope it's not our fault

10:26.026 --> 10:28.161
that Jimmy turned out
to be so...

10:28.195 --> 10:30.097
Jimmy.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
Let's not think
about this too hard.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.801
It's a beautiful day.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.168
I don't like
where this is going.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.205
Okay, honey.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.841
Water park's
closed for the day.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.842
How about we take her down
to the pet store,

10:41.875 --> 10:43.711
tell her it's a zoo?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.012
The Chinese restaurant
has a lobster tank.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.313
It's only half a block away.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.917
Aquarium it is.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.157
I can't believe
how much space you got in here.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.127
Yeah, it's big enough
in here to... go long.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.864
JIMMY: Our plan to get Brad
in the house worked perfectly.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.133
Now I needed
to squeeze a lifetime

11:06.166 --> 11:09.136
of brotherly memories
into two hours.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.038
(whispers): I'm playing catch
with my almost-brother.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.774
I think the house
might show better

11:13.807 --> 11:15.175
with the couch over there.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.877
Wow. How much
do you bench?

11:16.910 --> 11:20.781
I don't know, about 225, 230.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.816
Might help if you grab
the other side.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.485
Of the couch.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.721
Ten feet, four inches.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.756
(Cockney accent):
Tally-ho, wankers!

11:28.789 --> 11:30.323
Found this lift in the garage.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.160
We're good!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.229
Yeah, I guess
if it came down to it,

11:36.263 --> 11:39.066
I could beat up every other
real estate agent in town.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.268
Probably helps that most of them
are middle-aged women.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.235
You're awesome.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.737
This house is awesome!

11:43.771 --> 11:44.738
(chuckles)

11:44.772 --> 11:46.173
When this thing sells,

11:46.206 --> 11:47.941
you got to come over
to my neighborhood

11:47.975 --> 11:49.142
in Pleasant Valley Estates.

11:49.176 --> 11:53.280
There is a beautiful Tudor
Revival for sale on my block.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.215
We could be
block brothers.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.884
(Cockney accent):
Well, that sounds quite posh!

11:56.917 --> 11:59.186
Might be a little bit
out of our price range, yeah?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.288
It's not that pricey.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.358
Course, you'd have to join the
Pleasant Valley Country Club.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.962
There's a, uh, open house
this weekend.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.031
My parents are on
the new member committee.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.132
Mom and Dad?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.266
I mean, your mom and dad.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.301
That would be great.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.903
I would love to meet them.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.304
Listen, I'll just take a couple

12:17.337 --> 12:18.939
of more pictures here
for the Web site,

12:18.972 --> 12:20.407
and I'll be out of your hair.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.375
(giggles)

12:22.409 --> 12:24.311
(whispers, normal voice):
What are you doing?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.913
Didn't you see
what happened here?

12:25.946 --> 12:28.215
I mean, we played catch,
he gave me a shoulder ride,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.383
he told me four times
that he didn't want to wrestle.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.853
I mean, I finally
have a big brother.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.288
And I'm gonna meet
my almost-parents.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.290
Okay, but what are you gonna do
when he finds out

12:37.324 --> 12:38.926
that you're not a wealthy
surgical laser salesman

12:38.959 --> 12:39.626
who is selling a house?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.228
In a few weeks, I'll tell him

12:41.261 --> 12:43.063
we're keeping the house
because I got fired,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.264
which he'll believe
because I couldn't answer

12:44.297 --> 12:46.366
any of his questions
about surgery or lasers.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.268
He's amazing.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.837
He is amazing.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.904
Who?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.005
Oh, my almost-brother.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.807
And I hope you're not mad,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.943
but he invited me to
Pleasant Valley Country Club

12:55.976 --> 12:57.310
to meet with my almost-parents.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.812
Pleasant Valley
Country Club?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.914
That place is
crazy expensive.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.182
Now it all makes sense.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.952
Of course the Real Estate Agent
with the Hat

13:04.985 --> 13:06.086
turned out better than Jimmy.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.188
His parents were rich!

13:08.221 --> 13:10.023
What do you mean?
Your mom was starting to think

13:10.057 --> 13:12.359
that you're being a failure
was our fault.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.295
Oh, my God, you're right.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.430
I could've been
as successful as him.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.300
And it's all
your fault.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.269
Why didn't I realize
that earlier?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.971
Oh, that's probably
your fault, too.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.205
No, no.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.306
It has nothing to do
with parenting.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.008
They had money.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.042
Okay, but the Jenkins
aren't rich.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.178
I mean, he's
got a little

13:31.211 --> 13:32.512
plumbing business
and she's a school lunch lady.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.981
That's impossible, Jimmy.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.949
Everyone who goes to
that country club is rich.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.918
I bet they all own swans.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.619
No, Brad got them
their membership.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.022
And he's the one who's rich
because his parents gave him

13:42.055 --> 13:44.925
confidence, education
and self-esteem!

13:44.958 --> 13:47.060
Well, we don't have
any of those things, Jimmy,

13:47.094 --> 13:49.829
so how are we supposed
to give them to you?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.218
Excuse me, señor.
Coat check?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.285
Oh. Um...

14:15.388 --> 14:17.424
Good to go.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.261
Hey, Jimbo!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.330
(chuckles):
Hey!

14:23.363 --> 14:25.098
Where's the fiancée?
Oh, uh, sick.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.900
Just terrible sore throat.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.336
The doctor says she might even
lose her accent.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.370
That's crazy.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.905
I know.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.341
The body-- she's a mystery, huh?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.342
Yeah.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.244
Well, how about we get
you an application, huh?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.512
Uh, we might have to hold off.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.215
There have been some cutbacks
at the laser surgery factory.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.417
I mean, who knows,
a month from now, I could be

14:44.451 --> 14:46.253
bagging groceries for a living.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.287
We'd still be friends, right?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.456
Playing hard
to get, huh?

14:49.489 --> 14:53.093
Well, there's a reason why
"Sheila with the Scarf"

14:53.126 --> 14:55.195
isn't the number one home
broker in Natesville anymore.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.230
Because I never
give up on a sale.

14:57.264 --> 15:01.001
Hey, come on, I want
you to meet my parents.

15:01.034 --> 15:05.238
Mom and Dad, I want you to
meet my new friend, Jimmy.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.706
Well, hello, Jimmy.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.208
We've heard
a lot about you.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.276
And these are the Bergers.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.044
They're thinking
of joining, too.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.946
Hello, my good man.
Ronald Berger.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.214
I own a rock and roll

15:14.247 --> 15:16.249
equipment
manufacturing company.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.284
This is my wife, Wendy.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.252
She's a nurse.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.453
And a lawyer.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.123
And I'm also a
private detective.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.225
Okay, well, you guys
get to know each other.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.161
We'll go put your applications
in the office.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.330
Brad, why don't you
go get us a table.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.965
On it, Mommy.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.303
What are you guys doing here?

15:36.336 --> 15:39.139
We had to see these Jenkins
for ourselves.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.308
There is no way they raised
a kid like Brad without having

15:41.341 --> 15:43.343
some kind of advantages
we didn't.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.346
Did you ever think that
maybe they just weren't lazy?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.347
Oh, please.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.348
All parents are lazy.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.150
Kids are exhausting.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.618
They're God's punishment
for having sex.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.420
They're cheating somehow.
We're gonna find out how.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.522
You're gonna blow this for me.
I am bonding with

15:55.555 --> 15:56.456
my almost-parents.
You ripped me

15:56.489 --> 15:57.991
out of their lives once,

15:58.025 --> 15:59.092
just don't do it again.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.293
Oh, stop doing that.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.029
It's so gross!

16:02.062 --> 16:03.430
It's a nervous habit!
I probably picked it up

16:03.463 --> 16:04.464
'cause of something
you guys did.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.033
No way.
You had that creepy habit

16:06.066 --> 16:07.534
since before you were born.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.302
I got ultrasound pictures
of you nibbling on my kidney.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.272
Okay, guys, table's ready.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.274
Okay, Sabrina warned me
about a couple things.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.209
Sometimes the water has bubbles.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.379
And there are way more forks
than you will ever need.

16:21.381 --> 16:27.187
I met Ronald while
I was nursing him

16:27.220 --> 16:30.323
after an accident at the rock
and roll manufacturing plant.

16:30.357 --> 16:35.062
We sued the factory,
and now he owns it.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.064
And I'm a private detective.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.399
(chuckles)

16:39.432 --> 16:41.534
Anyway, that's
our boring story.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.172
So, Denise, Bill,
you are not wealthy.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.041
What advantages did you have
in raising your child?

16:48.075 --> 16:49.709
Excuse me?

16:49.742 --> 16:52.212
I'm sure the gentleman
is just wondering

16:52.245 --> 16:54.314
how you managed to raise
such a successful son.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.149
I'm guessing that

16:56.183 --> 16:58.351
it was just doing
the normal things,

16:58.385 --> 17:02.255
like camping outdoors,
actual karate lessons,

17:02.289 --> 17:04.257
going to the park
even if it's hot.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.293
Well, yeah. Of course.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.162
But he's a huge, successful

17:09.196 --> 17:11.131
real estate mongrel.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.100
You don't get that
from karate lessons.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.335
Jackie Chan couldn't
sell me a house.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.270
I can't understand
a word he says.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.507
Actually, I developed a love for
real estate when my mom took me

17:20.540 --> 17:23.076
to a Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit
at the museum.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.577
You took him to real museums?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.279
Good for you.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.116
But weren't there
really long lines at the museum?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.284
We've heard museums usually have
really long lines.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.619
Well, sometimes.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.556
But I always carried
little games and puzzles

17:36.589 --> 17:38.191
in my purse
just in case.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.160
Games and puzzles in your purse.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.095
I guess you can do that
if it's not stuffed

17:42.129 --> 17:43.230
with cigarettes and licorice.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.297
I shared the licorice with you,

17:44.331 --> 17:46.499
but you cried and said
it tasted like cigarettes.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.638
Do you... know each other?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.273
JIMMY:
No.

17:53.306 --> 17:57.244
I'm sorry, um, what did you--

17:57.277 --> 17:59.312
Did you say
something about...

17:59.346 --> 18:01.148
licorice?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.415
Chad?

18:11.258 --> 18:14.294
Did he just eat his eyebrow?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.428
Oh.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.564
Chad?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.166
Is it you?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.301
It is. It's me.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.169
(spits)

18:22.202 --> 18:23.270
BILL:
Thank heavens.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.138
Our Chad's come back!

18:25.172 --> 18:26.173
(sobbing)

18:38.385 --> 18:41.154
I'm just so relieved
that you turned out to be

18:41.188 --> 18:43.156
a successful businessman

18:43.190 --> 18:44.257
who's going to join
our country club.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.758
Me, too.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.295
I did not think
those two idiot teenagers

18:48.328 --> 18:50.197
had what it took to
raise a successful kid.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.331
They didn't.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.266
They did a horrible job.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.204
I barely got my GED,
I knocked up a serial killer,

18:57.237 --> 19:00.340
and now I'm a single dad working
as a bagger at a grocery store.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.774
Plus, I still
say "pasghetti,"

19:01.808 --> 19:04.444
and I don't know why
or how to fix it.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.845
It's true.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.314
We're the worst
parents ever.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.381
I knew this day would come.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.682
We've run out of excuses.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.717
No kidding.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.552
When we get home, there's some

19:12.585 --> 19:15.388
"World's Greatest" mugs
I'm gonna need to get rid of.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.657
Wait, you're
the idiot teenagers?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.392
Sorry, Jimmy.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.193
We feel horrible.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.263
You are who you
are because of us.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.365
If we hadn't been so selfish
and stolen you back,

19:25.398 --> 19:27.400
you might have ended up
like Brad.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.369
I hope this doesn't affect
our chances for membership.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.304
I've never tasted meat
like this.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.206
I can't believe you people.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.643
You are the worst,
laziest parents ever.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.546
And you're no better--
with an illegitimate child

19:39.579 --> 19:42.282
from a serial killer?

19:42.315 --> 19:45.352
And all of you lie
about your identities.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.354
You're as bad as the Mexicans!

19:48.388 --> 19:50.423
Excuse me.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.260
I happen to work with
quite a few Mexicans.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.427
Oh, there's a shocker.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.328
BILL: Judging by
your grammar,

19:55.362 --> 19:57.430
I'm guessing you're chummy

19:57.464 --> 19:59.332
with the blacks, as well.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.369
BURT, VIRGINIA and JIMMY:
Oh!

20:02.402 --> 20:06.373
I can't believe I let you
sit on my shoulders.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.281
Oh, my God.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.283
If you hadn't taken me back,

20:16.316 --> 20:18.251
I would've ended up
just like them.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.687
Thank you.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.555
Let's go home.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.357
You know, before we go,

20:24.391 --> 20:27.427
I have been dying to try
Bill's fancy macaroni.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.528
Excuse me, sir.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.263
I cannot let you eat

20:30.297 --> 20:33.300
Mr. Jenkins' pasta
in special Alfredo sauce.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.434
Why not?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.935
Because I am Alfredo.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.274
JIMMY: I'm not gonna lie,
we were pretty lucky

20:41.308 --> 20:43.810
those folks turned out to be
massive racists.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.712
Because it made me realize
that even though

20:45.745 --> 20:48.315
my parents were kind of lazy,
I was better off

20:48.348 --> 20:50.983
having been raised
by good people.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.622
It also made us realize
that we had to work on

20:55.655 --> 20:57.490
not being so lazy with Hope.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.959
Like going camping outdoors,
so we could roast marshmallows

20:59.992 --> 21:01.461
over a campfire instead of

21:01.494 --> 21:03.396
pressing them up against
the radiator.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.299
Even if we only made it to
the backyard, it was a start.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.668
Or finding a clever way
to survive

21:08.701 --> 21:12.805
a 15-minute wait
at an actual museum.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.442
Or going to an actual park,

21:15.475 --> 21:17.810
no matter how hot
it was outside.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.313
Wow, she is really
into that rock.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.315
Maybe she's gonna be
a geologist.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.354
Ooh. Or an extreme eater.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.522
That's a thing, right?

21:29.556 --> 21:31.691
I've heard
people say it.
