00:07.477 --> 00:10.401
What are you doing?
That's Crisco!

00:11.334 --> 00:15.355
I can't help it. I'm delirious
from cosmetics depravation.

00:15.356 --> 00:18.291
I rush-ordered some indonesian
rosewood oil last week,

00:18.292 --> 00:19.693
And it still hasn't arrived.

00:19.694 --> 00:22.295
- The indonesian rosewood
is endangered.

00:22.296 --> 00:26.329
- I know. That's why the box
is labeled "auto parts."

00:26.330 --> 00:28.092
- We're just going
to a wine tasting.

00:28.093 --> 00:29.858
It's not exactly
a photo shoot for <i>vogue.</i>

00:29.859 --> 00:30.890
- Yeah, well,
what if someone

00:30.891 --> 00:32.555
Tips off
the cleveland paparazzi?

00:32.555 --> 00:34.022
- You called three times.

00:34.023 --> 00:37.253
He's not coming.

00:40.594 --> 00:43.894
- Oh, elka,
have you gone goth?

00:43.895 --> 00:45.528
- I'm going to a funeral.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.793
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47.794 --> 00:48.894
Who died?

00:48.895 --> 00:51.393
- I don't know.

00:51.394 --> 00:53.160
Some guy, I guess.

00:53.161 --> 00:58.034
My friend sheila
crashes funerals to meet men.

00:59.406 --> 01:01.306
I'm going with.

01:01.307 --> 01:03.309
- But you have max.

01:03.310 --> 01:06.311
- Just because
I'm chained to the fence,

01:06.312 --> 01:10.217
It doesn't mean
I can't bark at the cars.

01:14.524 --> 01:16.625
- Good morning!

01:16.626 --> 01:19.295
- Great morning!

01:23.968 --> 01:27.537
- What else do you want
for breakfast?

01:27.538 --> 01:30.908
- I really don't have much
of an appetite this morning.

01:30.909 --> 01:33.710
- I don't either anymore.

01:33.711 --> 01:35.611
- Well, I better
get out of here

01:35.612 --> 01:38.013
So you women
can talk about me.

01:43.217 --> 01:46.452
- How cute is she?

01:46.453 --> 01:48.620
- Oh, very.

01:48.621 --> 01:51.189
- How cute is he?

01:51.190 --> 01:52.924
Wait, wait, wait,
I'll walk you out.

01:52.925 --> 01:54.859
That way,
you can frisk me again.

01:54.860 --> 01:58.029
- Well, you are
a "person of interest."

01:58.030 --> 02:01.733
- Oh, I'll be so relieved when
the bad pun stage is over.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.501
- It could be worse.

02:03.502 --> 02:04.870
You know,
we hardly ever see melanie

02:04.871 --> 02:06.138
Now that she's
dating pete.

02:06.139 --> 02:07.806
- But I've heard everything.

02:07.807 --> 02:09.874
Everything.

02:09.875 --> 02:11.642
- Well, I have some earplugs
you can use.

02:11.643 --> 02:12.977
I had to buy a box of them

02:12.978 --> 02:14.812
Because of that owl
that keeps me up at night.

02:14.813 --> 02:18.482
- That's not an owl,
that's them!

02:18.483 --> 02:21.651
- Good lord,
she hoots like that?

02:21.652 --> 02:24.887
- I think it's him.
It's weird.

02:27.657 --> 02:29.490
- Isn't pete the best?

02:29.491 --> 02:32.493
- "owl" say.

02:41.271 --> 02:43.372
- What?
What's so funny?

02:43.373 --> 02:44.640
- It's nothing.

02:44.641 --> 02:47.644
You better get dressed
for our ohio wine tasting.

02:47.645 --> 02:51.347
- Oh, no!
I totally forgot about that.

02:51.348 --> 02:52.549
You know,
I promised pete

02:52.550 --> 02:53.983
That I'd take him
hiking this afternoon.

02:53.984 --> 02:55.385
- You're canceling
on us again?

02:55.386 --> 02:57.520
- I'm sorry. I seem to be
doing that a lot.

02:57.521 --> 02:58.688
But you guys
can go without me.

02:58.689 --> 03:00.423
- Oh, no, we'll just wait
till next week.

03:00.424 --> 03:01.691
It's no fun without you.

03:01.692 --> 03:03.360
- Aw.

03:03.361 --> 03:07.631
- After all, you're
our designated driver.

03:07.632 --> 03:11.735
- Yes. I'm not gonna spit out
perfectly free wine.

03:11.736 --> 03:13.270
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:13.271 --> 03:15.907
But you and I are definitely on
for our movie tonight, okay?

03:15.908 --> 03:18.276
But can you guys blame me?
You understand, right?

03:18.277 --> 03:20.879
He's just so cute!

03:20.880 --> 03:24.115
Outside, I stole a kiss

03:24.116 --> 03:27.852
And then he pretended to
read me my miranda rights,

03:27.853 --> 03:33.853
And then he said, "you have the
right to remain adorable."

03:37.695 --> 03:40.730
- Hear that?

03:40.731 --> 03:45.201
It's the sound of us
all turning against you.

[doorbell rings]

03:59.717 --> 04:02.085
- Don't get up.

04:04.588 --> 04:05.889
- Where is she?

04:05.890 --> 04:06.956
- I beg your pardon?

04:06.957 --> 04:10.560
- Oh, my god.

04:10.561 --> 04:13.930
Ms. Chase.

04:13.931 --> 04:15.531
My name is zack adams.

04:15.532 --> 04:20.402
Like yourself, I am a devotee
of the craft of thespis.

04:20.403 --> 04:22.237
- Shocker.

04:22.238 --> 04:25.473
- I am also a devotee
of honor st. Raven,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.208
Which is why I am pleased
to give you this package

04:27.209 --> 04:29.444
From "indonesian
beauty auto supply."

04:29.445 --> 04:31.712
- Oh, my rosewood oil!

04:31.713 --> 04:33.481
How did you get this?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.615
- The mailman brought it.

04:34.616 --> 04:37.018
I live at the same house number,
two blocks over.

04:37.019 --> 04:41.890
And it's almost as if the hand
of god was at work,

04:41.891 --> 04:44.492
Only it wasn't god because the
mailman does this all the time,

04:44.493 --> 04:47.330
And I think he smokes weed.

04:47.331 --> 04:49.165
- Well, thank you, zack.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.901
It's always so nice to meet
such an enthusiastic fan.

04:51.902 --> 04:56.906
- Honor st. Raven taught me
courage, determination, love...

04:56.907 --> 04:58.908
Even how to
survive a blizzard

04:58.909 --> 05:02.445
By crawling
inside a bear carcass.

05:02.446 --> 05:07.083
- "I never wear fur,
but this is an emergency!"

05:07.084 --> 05:09.219
- That was during the writers'
strike, wasn't it?

05:09.220 --> 05:13.790
- Ah! The best six months
of my life.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.992
- Actually, ms. Chase,

05:15.993 --> 05:18.328
I too am in
a blizzard of sorts,

05:18.329 --> 05:24.100
And I need you
to be my bear carcass.

05:24.101 --> 05:26.202
- I'm intrigued.

05:26.203 --> 05:28.271
- We're in rehearsal
for our school play

05:28.272 --> 05:30.873
And I desperately need you
to help us not make it suck.

05:30.874 --> 05:32.875
Even a word from you

05:32.876 --> 05:36.079
Would be as rejuvenating as
the indonesian rosewood oil--

05:36.080 --> 05:38.014
Which, I might add,
you hardly need.

05:38.015 --> 05:41.252
- [laughs]

05:44.890 --> 05:48.292
- Look, I'm flattered,

05:48.293 --> 05:50.661
But I'm not really
a school play sort of person.

05:50.662 --> 05:52.029
- But you have to!

05:52.030 --> 05:53.230
We're doing
<i>romeo and juliet,</i>

05:53.231 --> 05:54.632
Which I know
is the first thing

05:54.633 --> 05:56.033
You ever acted in
in high school.

05:56.034 --> 05:57.134
- Well, that is true.

05:57.135 --> 05:58.569
- And our production
is doomed

05:58.570 --> 06:01.339
Because the soccer coach is now
doubling as the drama teacher

06:01.340 --> 06:04.809
Due of budget cuts.

06:04.810 --> 06:06.177
- God, I hate jocks.

06:06.178 --> 06:08.179
- You were married
to a wide receiver.

06:08.180 --> 06:10.482
- I still don't know
what sport that was.

06:13.587 --> 06:14.854
- Please come.

06:14.855 --> 06:16.589
The man wants to put
the character names

06:16.590 --> 06:18.558
On the back of our costumes.

06:18.559 --> 06:22.596
- What kind of monster
is he?

06:22.597 --> 06:26.000
Zack, I will be
your carcass.

06:33.902 --> 06:36.003
- All acting is an art,

06:36.004 --> 06:38.239
Whether some great work
on broadway

06:38.240 --> 06:39.907
Or a production of
<i>romeo and juliet</i>

06:39.908 --> 06:42.844
Right here in your little
school cafetorium.

06:42.845 --> 06:45.247
For why else would
victoria chase

06:45.248 --> 06:48.750
Be standing here before you
on this humble stage?

06:48.751 --> 06:50.752
Because, believe it or not,

06:50.753 --> 06:53.355
I was once where you are.

06:53.356 --> 06:56.058
Albeit taller
and with better skin.

06:56.059 --> 07:01.530
So dig deep and strive hard
to be a true artist.

07:01.531 --> 07:05.100
Because that is when
the awards come a'calling.

07:05.101 --> 07:08.770
And you had better be ready
because they are awesome.

07:08.771 --> 07:11.940
[applause]

07:11.941 --> 07:13.908
- Inspiring stuff.
- Ah, thank you.

07:13.909 --> 07:15.676
- Campbell, I see you smirk
like that again,

07:15.677 --> 07:17.945
I'll knock your block off.

07:17.946 --> 07:22.317
Okay, bring it in
and take a knee.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.685
Listen up.

07:23.686 --> 07:25.820
We got our first show
on Friday,

07:25.821 --> 07:27.221
And your parents
aren't paying

07:27.222 --> 07:30.124
To see a bunch of amateur
ragtime grab-ass up here.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.192
So let's execute!

07:32.193 --> 07:34.227
Hands in,
"shakespeare" on three.

07:34.228 --> 07:37.063
Everybody, know your lines
and be awesome.

07:37.064 --> 07:38.064
One, two, three.

07:38.065 --> 07:41.067
All: Shakespeare!

07:42.236 --> 07:44.403
- I see what
you're dealing with here.

07:44.404 --> 07:47.140
- Shh! Don't let him
catch you talking to me.

07:47.141 --> 07:49.442
He'll make me do push-ups.

07:49.443 --> 07:52.446
Boy push-ups.

07:57.219 --> 08:00.589
- Excuse me,
is this seat taken?

08:00.590 --> 08:03.358
- Oh.
Um...

08:03.359 --> 08:05.628
Sorry, I'm waiting
for my friend.

08:05.629 --> 08:08.297
- No problem.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.835
- Is this seat taken?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.278
- So that guy's
the bachelor?

08:24.279 --> 08:25.946
- For this season.

08:25.947 --> 08:29.317
- Looks like a guy
you want to punch.

08:29.318 --> 08:33.455
- Shh! They're about to start
the rose ceremony.

08:33.456 --> 08:39.328
- Do the women know
he's gay?

08:39.328 --> 08:40.863
Oh, big surprise.

08:40.864 --> 08:43.332
He chose the one with
the biggest breasts.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.536
- And she's a paralegal.

08:46.537 --> 08:48.171
And they made
a beautiful connection

08:48.172 --> 08:49.906
That night he dated
those two other women.

08:49.907 --> 08:51.207
- Oh, yeah.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.543
Told them both
they were the one.

08:53.544 --> 08:54.710
- You know what?

08:54.711 --> 08:56.545
You're worse than
watching this with joy.

08:56.546 --> 08:58.647
Oh, my god, joy!

08:58.648 --> 09:00.349
I was supposed to
meet her at the movies!

09:07.123 --> 09:08.390
- Excuse me,

09:08.391 --> 09:10.759
It appears my friend
isn't coming after all.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.761
- Thanks, I'm good.

09:18.735 --> 09:20.737
- Coming soon...

09:20.738 --> 09:22.806
They were
as close as sisters,

09:22.807 --> 09:26.877
Until the summer that would
change everything.

09:26.878 --> 09:29.880
- If you don't have friends,
you have nothing.

09:29.881 --> 09:32.549
Nothing!

09:35.474 --> 09:38.587
- My lips, two blushing
pilgrims, ready stand

09:38.588 --> 09:42.515
To smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.872
- Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

09:45.873 --> 09:48.507
Which mannerly devotion
shows in this--

09:48.508 --> 09:49.642
- [whistle blows]

09:49.643 --> 09:51.110
Barker, you're out
of position again.

09:51.111 --> 09:53.379
Drop and gimme 20.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.947
- This is
a waking nightmare.

09:54.948 --> 09:57.517
- Well, everyone's just
too scared to act.

09:57.518 --> 10:01.187
Except you, zack.
You are mercutio.

10:01.188 --> 10:03.523
[gina clears her throat]

10:03.524 --> 10:06.359
- This is my friend, gina.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.996
My girlfriend, gina.

10:09.997 --> 10:12.632
- Really. Well,
nice to meet you, gina.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.200
And are you an actor also?

10:14.201 --> 10:15.769
- Oh, hair and makeup.
- Ah.

10:15.770 --> 10:17.537
- I keep telling her
I should have a beard.

10:17.538 --> 10:20.540
- Oh, I wouldn't bother.

10:20.541 --> 10:22.475
- All right, guys,
pick up the pace.

10:22.476 --> 10:24.143
We need to motor
through the boring parts.

10:24.144 --> 10:27.314
Actually, coach, I know
a couple of acting exercises

10:27.315 --> 10:28.682
I think might loosen
everyone up.

10:28.683 --> 10:30.985
- These kids
don't need loosening up.

10:30.986 --> 10:32.987
They need
a swift kick in the ass.

10:32.988 --> 10:34.622
- You know, I have worked

10:34.623 --> 10:36.257
With tyrannical directors
like you.

10:36.258 --> 10:38.092
It's not helpful.

10:38.093 --> 10:40.260
Performance
is a collaboration.

10:40.261 --> 10:42.830
- Lady, I'm just trying
to get to the sword fight.

10:42.831 --> 10:46.334
- <i>Romeo and juliet</i> is not
about a sword fight.

10:46.335 --> 10:47.801
- Well, if it was,

10:47.802 --> 10:50.537
Maybe more people
would have heard of it.

10:52.707 --> 10:54.341
- You are
a terrible director,

10:54.342 --> 10:56.610
And I know a thing or two
about directing.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.846
I took a class called "a thing
or two about directing."

10:58.847 --> 11:02.584
- Fine, if you think
you can do better, go for it.

11:02.585 --> 11:04.419
Just don't dehydrate them.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.520
We've had lawsuits.

11:05.521 --> 11:07.489
- No, but you d--

11:11.829 --> 11:13.396
- What's all that?

11:13.397 --> 11:15.900
- Oh, I told melanie
I'd do her brows.

11:15.901 --> 11:18.335
- I'm surprised you're even
speaking to her,

11:18.336 --> 11:19.703
The way
she's been treating you.

11:19.704 --> 11:21.572
- Oh, it's okay.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.641
So she stood me up
a few times.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.542
She has a new boyfriend.
I get it.

11:25.543 --> 11:28.212
- That's no excuse.

11:28.213 --> 11:32.883
In poland, the nuns had a
saying, "kur przed koguty."

11:34.052 --> 11:37.322
It means,
"chicks before..."

11:37.323 --> 11:39.858
You know what.

11:41.795 --> 11:43.295
- The nuns said that?

11:43.296 --> 11:47.767
- It was no <i>sound of music.</i>

11:47.768 --> 11:49.769
- Right.

11:51.172 --> 11:52.907
- Thanks again
for doing this.

11:52.908 --> 11:54.909
And again, I'm so sorry
about last night.

11:54.910 --> 11:57.278
- Stop apologizing.
It's all forgotten.

11:57.279 --> 11:58.679
- I just lost track of time.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.713
Whenever I'm with pete,

11:59.714 --> 12:01.948
I just--I forget about
everything else.

12:01.949 --> 12:03.516
Oh, did I tell you,

12:03.517 --> 12:06.119
This morning,
he said the cutest thing.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.253
Ow!

12:07.254 --> 12:10.256
- Oh, my bad.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.564
Raw cookie dough?

12:18.565 --> 12:21.668
Did you finally get that
peruvian tapeworm you ordered?

12:21.669 --> 12:25.439
- No. The mule got caught
at customs again.

12:27.141 --> 12:29.277
Look, it's opening night,
and I need this.

12:29.278 --> 12:31.145
- I thought everything
was going great.

12:31.146 --> 12:32.180
What's the problem?

12:32.181 --> 12:34.315
- The problem is juliet.

12:34.316 --> 12:36.050
She's a lox.

12:36.051 --> 12:37.819
When she dies at the end,
no one can tell,

12:37.820 --> 12:41.355
Because she's been
so lifeless all along.

12:41.356 --> 12:42.723
- Doesn't she have
an understudy?

12:42.724 --> 12:44.224
- Ah, yes, theresa.

12:44.225 --> 12:45.559
Remind me
to send her flowers.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.196
She had her baby
this afternoon.

12:50.197 --> 12:51.665
God, what am I gonna do?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.800
- Maybe your actress
is just scared.

12:53.801 --> 12:55.535
Weren't you scared
when you started?

12:55.536 --> 13:00.207
- Of what?
Too much adulation?

13:00.208 --> 13:02.977
- Clearly it's hard for you
to relate to the untalented,

13:02.978 --> 13:04.879
But imagine,
just for a second,

13:04.880 --> 13:07.348
What it would be like
if you were one of them.

13:11.587 --> 13:13.722
- Inspiration has struck.

13:13.723 --> 13:15.657
I know just
what to say to her.

13:15.658 --> 13:18.193
Oh, victoria chase's
<i>romeo and juliet</i>

13:18.194 --> 13:19.928
Is going to be a triumph!

13:19.929 --> 13:22.831
Isn't it william shakespeare's
<i>romeo and juliet?</i>

13:22.832 --> 13:24.466
- Uh, well,
I tweaked a few lines,

13:24.467 --> 13:27.803
So will and I are gonna share
credit on the program.

13:29.038 --> 13:31.773
- The wax is hot. Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:31.774 --> 13:33.775
Can you give me a little bit
of a higher arch this time?

13:33.776 --> 13:34.776
Because I'm meeting
pete's friends

13:34.777 --> 13:35.877
For dinner tomorrow night,

13:35.878 --> 13:37.645
And I want them
to think I'm pretty.

13:37.646 --> 13:40.248
Well, you know,
and smart and stuff.

13:40.249 --> 13:43.051
- Tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

13:43.052 --> 13:45.453
[gasps]
oh, joy! Oh, no!

13:45.454 --> 13:46.787
Little Italy,
you and me, dinner.

13:46.788 --> 13:48.956
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:48.957 --> 13:51.458
Listen, I would cancel,
but it's pete's friends,

13:51.459 --> 13:52.892
And you know how important
friends are.

13:52.893 --> 13:56.029
- Yes, if you don't have
friends, you have nothing.

13:56.030 --> 13:58.332
Nothing.
- Ow!

13:58.333 --> 14:01.335
- Ooh, boy.

14:02.671 --> 14:06.074
- What?
What did you do?

14:06.075 --> 14:09.445
Aah!

14:09.446 --> 14:12.481
Where's my eyebrow?

14:12.482 --> 14:16.186
- It's right here.

14:17.188 --> 14:18.888
- [crying]

14:20.429 --> 14:21.596
- And exhale.

14:21.597 --> 14:24.165
[all exhaling]

14:24.913 --> 14:27.548
Now, places.

14:27.549 --> 14:29.416
Where is my juliet?

14:29.417 --> 14:31.485
- Yeah, ms. Chase?

14:31.486 --> 14:33.254
- How are you feeling,
francesca?

14:33.255 --> 14:34.589
- Like I want to puke.

14:34.590 --> 14:36.457
- Ah, that's good.
- That's good?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.393
- Yes, yes. That means
you're afraid.

14:38.394 --> 14:41.696
Now, do you know
what you're afraid of?

14:41.697 --> 14:43.398
- You?

14:43.399 --> 14:46.401
- No, realizing your dream.

14:46.402 --> 14:48.904
Because in that dream is
the truth about yourself.

14:48.905 --> 14:50.906
Now, I want you to
close your eyes

14:50.907 --> 14:52.508
And visualize it.

14:52.509 --> 14:54.777
Can you see it, francesca?

14:54.778 --> 14:57.446
- I think so.

14:57.447 --> 14:59.315
Yeah, I see it.

14:59.316 --> 15:03.186
- You are confident, talented,
owning the stage.

15:03.187 --> 15:06.122
Every line a triumph,
every gesture a revelation.

15:06.123 --> 15:11.662
You are a young--well, younger--
victoria chase.

15:11.663 --> 15:13.931
You are me.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.167
- But I don't
want to be you.

15:16.168 --> 15:17.802
- What?

15:17.803 --> 15:20.639
- No, that's not my dream.
- But francesca--

15:20.640 --> 15:23.675
- Look, I'm sorry,
ms. Chase, but we both know

15:23.676 --> 15:25.410
This play's gonna be
way better without me.

15:25.411 --> 15:28.513
- Oh, boy.

15:28.514 --> 15:29.914
- Oh, my gosh.

15:29.915 --> 15:32.283
Thank you, miss chase.

15:32.284 --> 15:34.719
I see the truth
about myself, too!

15:34.720 --> 15:36.453
And I just want to
shout it out loud!

15:36.454 --> 15:39.155
- Not until after prom,
you don't.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.296
- Now who's gonna
play juliet?

15:47.297 --> 15:50.700
- Finally,
it's zack's turn.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.068
I know all of her lines,

15:52.069 --> 15:54.804
And besides,
it's my wig anyway.

16:02.246 --> 16:04.514
- I think there are three
empty seats over there.

16:04.515 --> 16:06.917
- I'm not blind,
just disfigured.

16:06.918 --> 16:09.186
- Accidents happen.

16:09.187 --> 16:10.921
- Yeah, accidents happen.

16:10.922 --> 16:14.191
- A wise man once said,
"there are no accidents."

16:14.192 --> 16:15.559
- That was freud.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.727
- I didn't get his name.

16:16.728 --> 16:19.530
It was just some old guy
I spilled my soda on.

16:22.901 --> 16:24.234
- Sorry.

16:24.235 --> 16:25.435
- Oh, now you apologize.

16:25.436 --> 16:28.005
- I was talking to them,
not to you.

16:28.006 --> 16:29.173
Sorry.

16:29.174 --> 16:31.175
Still them.

16:32.310 --> 16:34.178
Look, even if I did
do it on purpose,

16:34.179 --> 16:35.880
On some deep,
subconscious level,

16:35.881 --> 16:37.353
I must have had
a good reason.

16:37.354 --> 16:39.617
- So you admit it!
- I admit nothing.

16:39.618 --> 16:41.286
- Well, are you just
secretly upset

16:41.287 --> 16:42.487
That I have a boyfriend?

16:42.488 --> 16:44.722
- Of course not.
- Then what's the big deal?

16:44.723 --> 16:46.791
- She's upset that you've been
ditching your friends

16:46.792 --> 16:49.076
just because there's a new guy
in your life.

16:49.077 --> 16:52.280
It's as obvious
as that hickey on your neck.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.687
- She's right.

16:54.688 --> 16:57.490
Aren't we past the days when
a guy comes into your life

16:57.491 --> 17:01.094
And suddenly you become
oblivious to everyone else?

17:02.863 --> 17:03.997
- You're right.

17:03.998 --> 17:05.632
I have been acting a little bit
like a teenager.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.800
But in my defense, the last time
I had a boyfriend,

17:07.801 --> 17:10.703
I was a teenager.

17:10.704 --> 17:13.205
I'm really sorry that
we've been in your face.

17:13.207 --> 17:15.986
- And I'm sorry I took off
part of yours.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.377
- So far, I hate it.

17:29.041 --> 17:33.820
- O, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

17:35.692 --> 17:40.885
They pray; grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

17:48.110 --> 17:52.393
- Saints do not move, though
grant for prayer's sake.

17:53.144 --> 17:54.096
- [laughs]

17:54.097 --> 17:58.068
- Then move not, while
my prayer's effect I take.

18:05.844 --> 18:07.975
[audience ohs]

18:09.191 --> 18:13.154
- It's funny
'cause it's gross.

18:18.158 --> 18:20.440
[laughter]

18:20.441 --> 18:21.552
- Oh!

18:21.553 --> 18:23.636
[cheers and applause]

18:23.637 --> 18:26.339
- Honey,
that was so great!

18:26.340 --> 18:28.474
- Best romeo and juliet
I've ever seen.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.409
- Oh, yeah,
a lot of laughs.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.046
- Oh, thank you.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.649
Kelly mushlin proclaimed it
a "smash hit."

18:36.650 --> 18:37.543
- Who?
- A tenth grader.

18:37.544 --> 18:40.947
She writes for the school paper.

18:40.948 --> 18:42.921
- Wow, you seem so happy.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.322
- Well, I'm just so excited
to be back

18:44.323 --> 18:47.625
In the legitimate theater
again.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.328
Um, I have
an announcement to make.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.364
Uh, the school asked
if I would stay on

18:53.365 --> 18:56.601
As the drama advisor,
and I said yes.

18:56.602 --> 19:00.238
- Are you serious?
That's wonderful!

19:00.239 --> 19:04.242
- I think that might
actually be quite fantastic.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.710
- What about your career?

19:05.711 --> 19:07.212
- Oh, if get offered a part,

19:07.213 --> 19:08.947
I am on the next plane
out of here.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.517
You know, in acting, we call
that michael caine's law.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.952
[text message chime]

19:13.953 --> 19:16.321
- Oh.
Oh, it's pete.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.924
He wants me
to come meet him.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.693
But I'm telling him no.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.628
I'm spending the evening
with my girlfriends.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.029
- Ah!

19:25.030 --> 19:28.766
- Because nothing in life
is as important as friendship.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.736
- Or is it also because you look
like a hideous freak

19:31.737 --> 19:33.871
Without your eyebrow?

19:41.247 --> 19:42.814
- Yeah, there's that too.
