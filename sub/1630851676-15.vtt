WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.178
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:04.221 --> 00:06.702
I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.

00:06.745 --> 00:09.226
Oh, man, we're screwed.
This guy's a cop.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.272
I'm here for you.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.100
Whenever you need me.

00:13.143 --> 00:16.103
Give that to the chief for me?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.541
Now that you know my secrets,

00:19.584 --> 00:22.326
you're gonna have to grow up
just a little faster.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.807
But maybe we can just
start by giving each other

00:24.850 --> 00:26.200
the benefit of the doubt.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.682
That's Dad.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.989
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.208
No, no, no, no!

00:37.689 --> 00:39.343
Bishop.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.548
I can't do it, Shareen.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.160
Thank God. I thought
I was the only one.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.422
This isn't us.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.727
We're cashiers,
not criminals.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.294
But we really need the money.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.730
We'll find another way.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.515
We planned the
heist, didn't we?

01:20.558 --> 01:22.082
And look how
far we got.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.388
We'll figure it out
and do it honestly.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.955
Come on. We leave now,

01:25.998 --> 01:28.131
it'll be like
we were never here.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.306
Are you kidding me?

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
After everything
I have done for you,

01:30.960 --> 01:32.266
you stuff your pockets
in the middle of a job?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.876
No! I swear.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.138
That's why we've been short.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.748
He's been skimming us
this whole time.

01:36.792 --> 01:37.923
Oh, you're a little Judas
bitch, you know that?

01:40.404 --> 01:42.058
Yo.Someone here?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.320
- Go!-
Get them!

01:45.061 --> 01:46.541
Come on!

01:58.553 --> 02:01.164
Well, sure, if you're up for it.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.948
Okay. I'll meet you there.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.211
Going out?

02:10.347 --> 02:13.263
Aunt Vi, what you
doing up so late?

02:13.307 --> 02:15.265
The muse strikes at odd hours.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.267
When it does, I listen.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.356
I could ask
the same of you.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.315
The muse and trouble both.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.925
You be careful out there.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.274
I always am.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.849
Hey. Mom just go out?

02:33.892 --> 02:36.982
Yeah. She, uh...

02:37.026 --> 02:39.594
She just got
one of those calls.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.900
Did we wake you up?

02:41.944 --> 02:44.555
No, I, um, heard her
on the phone.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.169
It's like00 a.m.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.171
Does she really have to get up
and run out

02:51.214 --> 02:52.172
in the middle of the night?

02:52.215 --> 02:53.912
I mean,

02:53.956 --> 02:55.653
Dad's a doctor, he has to.

02:55.697 --> 02:59.483
But at least when he does it,
I know he'll come back.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.919
You're worried.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.095
Aren't you?

03:04.619 --> 03:06.925
Bishop was her mentor.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.189
She said that he was
one of the best agents

03:09.232 --> 03:12.757
she'd ever met, and...

03:12.801 --> 03:14.977
he's gone.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.892
Mom's been pretty devastated.

03:19.503 --> 03:20.983
Don't you worry?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.465
Yeah, I do.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.728
Because no matter

03:26.771 --> 03:29.992
how capable your mom is,
she's...

03:31.950 --> 03:34.605
...she's not invincible.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.263
I say we talk to her. Together.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.960
Soon as she gets home.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.486
Yeah. Okay.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.712
We heard something weird
coming out of the safe,

03:54.756 --> 03:56.888
so we hid and then
these guys came out.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.455
There were three of them.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.718
They were arguing,
and then one of them just, like,

04:00.762 --> 04:03.330
pulled out a gun and, like,
murdered the other one.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.245
Just slow down, Jenna.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.421
Which Dollar One was robbed?

04:07.464 --> 04:09.249
The big one, off the 3.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.251
I'm a cashier there
with my friend Shareen.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.948
Why were you
at the store so late?

04:12.991 --> 04:16.908
Okay, you got to understand,
we were desperate.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.694
The court just gave full custody

04:19.737 --> 04:22.131
of my five-year-old son to my ex
because I got evicted.

04:22.174 --> 04:24.699
I can't pay rent
with what they pay me there.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.483
Shareen, she's got all
these medical bills

04:26.527 --> 04:29.312
from a miscarriage
that she had which...

04:29.356 --> 04:31.793
probably wouldn't have happened
if our college boy boss

04:31.836 --> 04:34.404
would've let her, I don't know,
sit down for five minutes

04:34.448 --> 04:36.754
or keep a water bottle
by the register.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.930
We didn't see any other way out.

04:38.974 --> 04:42.064
I'm not gonna get my Cody back
working minimum wage.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.761
Not even
with overtime.

04:43.805 --> 04:47.069
But we decided not to go
through with it, I swear.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.549
Go through with what, Jenna?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.204
We were gonna try
and rob the place, too.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.337
Give ourselves
a leg up.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.166
I figured insurance
would cover the losses.

04:57.209 --> 05:00.343
So Shar stole the key
to the safe,

05:00.387 --> 05:02.258
I cut the power to the cameras.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.825
And that's why you
didn't call the police.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.653
Yeah, but we didn't do it.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.351
As messed up as our lives are,
we-we knew it was wrong.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.484
We were about

05:10.527 --> 05:13.051
to walk away, and that's
when those guys came out.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.490
We ran and they shot at us.
They shot Shareen.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.622
Wait, they shot Shareen?Yeah, they shot her.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.145
Where is she?

05:24.062 --> 05:25.586
Hey, Shar?

05:25.629 --> 05:27.196
These people
are here to help us.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.502
How's it look?

05:28.545 --> 05:29.851
Jenna had a semester

05:29.894 --> 05:32.375
at nursing school and she...

05:32.419 --> 05:34.899
did her best
to stop the bleeding.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.380
You got a serious gunshot wound.
We got to get you to a hospital.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.122
No. No hospitals.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.602
We heard them say they'd check
every ER in the city

05:41.645 --> 05:42.820
until they found us.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.822
Did they see your faces?No.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.085
We were wearing ski masks.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.566
But we saw theirs.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.525
Did you recognize them?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.396
The shooter looked familiar,
like I'd seen him before.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.789
At the store.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.312
A customer, maybe.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.970
She's got a bullet
lodged in her abdomen.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.667
If we don't it treated,
she's gonna die.

06:05.974 --> 06:09.412
You get Jenna to the safe house.
I'll take Shareen to help.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.718
Any hospital you take her to

06:10.761 --> 06:12.415
will have to report it
to police.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.853
I'm not going to a hospital.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.642
Rob, what are you doing here?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.079
Delilah okay?

06:24.122 --> 06:27.299
Delilah's fine.
Miles, I need your help.

06:30.433 --> 06:34.002
Oh.Look, I know it's a hell
of a thing to ask your ex,

06:34.045 --> 06:35.612
but you're one of the
best surgeons in the city

06:35.656 --> 06:37.658
and I got no other choice.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.190
I need to know whose life
I'm saving here, Rob.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.758
The less you know, the better.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.021
Well, let's see.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.153
You couldn't take
this woman to a hospital,

06:55.197 --> 07:00.507
and so you brought her to me,
at home.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.031
Who's she running from?

07:03.074 --> 07:04.511
Police?

07:04.554 --> 07:07.209
Some international
bad guy collective?

07:07.252 --> 07:09.472
Shouldn't you be concentrating?

07:09.516 --> 07:11.213
I just know how you operate.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.869
Thought you left the CIA.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.087
I did.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.349
Then who are you
working for now?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.047
No one. I'm just
helping a friend.

07:19.090 --> 07:23.007
Well, your friend is very lucky.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.879
The bullet entered right here.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.969
A couple centimeters down, this
could've pierced her spleen.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.101
You guys were lucky I was here.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.410
I knew you'd be here.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.501
Kelly's out of town
and you a homebody now.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.242
Not like back in the day.

07:40.285 --> 07:46.161
Well, that's 'cause
I am older and wiser

07:46.204 --> 07:48.163
and we're not
in Somalia anymore.

07:48.206 --> 07:51.035
Oh, don't act like
you didn't love it.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.777
The danger, the adrenaline.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.953
Bullets flying over our heads,

07:55.997 --> 07:58.478
both of us believing
we could save the world.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.309
Yeah, I remember.

08:07.269 --> 08:11.099
But I left Doctors Without
Borders a long time ago,

08:11.142 --> 08:12.970
and this...

08:13.014 --> 08:15.712
is clearly not a peacekeeping
mission you're on.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.673
You know, Rob,
if anybody finds out about this,

08:19.716 --> 08:21.109
I'm gonna lose
my medical license.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.503
You can trust me, Miles.

08:24.678 --> 08:27.289
Yeah, I know better
than to trust you.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.554
I promise, no one will
find out about this. Just...

08:31.598 --> 08:34.209
I just need you to help me
save this woman's life.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.081
I just did.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.575
You're taking the bullet?

08:52.619 --> 08:55.099
I got to find out who shot her.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.146
She has no one else.

09:00.235 --> 09:04.587
I really appreciate this, Miles.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.546
Truly.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.421
Hey, wait, what should I do
with the patient?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.771
Keep her alive.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.129
You do know
I'm not a cop anymore?

09:25.173 --> 09:27.262
You still have friends.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.178
Look, I know what
you're going through,

09:30.221 --> 09:31.658
and I know it's not easy.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.095
Questioning the institution
and yourself.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.576
But I know you still
believe in justice.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.404
Does this have anything to do

09:39.448 --> 09:40.710
with what happened
to your friend?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.976
That's gonna take
a little more time.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.239
But I'm dealing with it
the best way I know how,

09:48.283 --> 09:51.982
which is focusing on others.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.897
Maybe that'd help you.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.204
You're really selling this.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.727
Look, I'm just trying to see

09:57.771 --> 10:00.643
if you'll call in a favor,
that's all.

10:00.687 --> 10:04.125
Run ballistics, see if that
slug connects to anything.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.822
Call in a favor, huh?

10:07.781 --> 10:10.958
Okay. On one condition.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.221
I'm gonna need
something from you.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.528
Your name.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.227
My name?

10:22.447 --> 10:25.581
And here I am thinking
you like a little mystery.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.584
Satisfying mysteries
are the ones that get solved.

10:30.368 --> 10:33.763
Let's just see
where this leads to first.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.854
Showing up to your ex-husband's

10:37.898 --> 10:39.290
with a gunshot victim?

10:39.334 --> 10:40.509
That's not awkward.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.032
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.077
How'd he react?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.687
Not well.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.471
But I did manage to keep
my new vocation out of it.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.648
And despite
our history,

10:48.691 --> 10:50.388
he saved Shareen's life.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.042
How'd it go with the robberies?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.740
So, you'd think all hell
would've broken loose

10:53.783 --> 10:55.306
this morning
after the store opened,

10:55.350 --> 10:58.353
but there hasn't been
a single call to the NYPD.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.964
Well, the safe should be open.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.792
Cash drawers
should be distributed.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.533
Someone should've noticed.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.056
Right, I don't know.
Maybe they gave the money back.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.797
After killing their partner?

11:07.841 --> 11:09.364
There would've been no time.
They would've had to grab

11:09.407 --> 11:11.105
that body and get
the hell out of there.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.542
Mm-hmm.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.370
Jenna said they were maskless.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.850
Were you able to pull up
any surveillance?

11:16.893 --> 11:20.505
Mm-hmm. Check this out.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.203
This is right about the time
of the robbery last night.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.639
Now, Jenna and Shareen

11:23.683 --> 11:26.163
said that they unplugged
the camera, right?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.949
So, technically, there shouldn't
be any image at all.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.733
Unless someone tampered
with the system.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.343
Uh-huh. And so, I checked,

11:32.387 --> 11:35.172
and this is looped footage
from the previous night.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.653
The robbers didn't wear masks
because they didn't have to.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.176
Rob, for someone
to pull this off,

11:39.220 --> 11:41.178
they would have to physically
access the system

11:41.222 --> 11:42.876
inside the store
before the break-in

11:42.919 --> 11:44.747
to make sure that nothing
was captured on camera.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.618
Well, can you tell
when the loop started?

11:46.662 --> 11:48.490
Yeah, it was just
last night before closing.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.232
And given that the system
is in an employees-only area...

11:51.275 --> 11:52.886
Then a Dollar One employee
was helping.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.540
Mm-hmm.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.281
If the accomplice
works in the store,

11:57.325 --> 12:00.502
then he's gonna know about
the two masked female witnesses.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.026
And when Jenna and Shareen
don't show up to work...

12:03.070 --> 12:04.506
Yeah, the killers
are gonna know,

12:04.549 --> 12:05.899
and they're gonna
come after them.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.422
Yeah, and it's gonna become

12:07.465 --> 12:09.641
even more dangerous
for their families.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.948
Jenna is gonna have
to go into work.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.776
And smile like
nothing ever happened.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.647
In the meantime,
run a background check

12:15.691 --> 12:17.475
on everyone in that store.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.999
See if anything stands out.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.132
You really think
someone from the store

12:22.176 --> 12:23.960
let those men in last night?

12:24.004 --> 12:27.921
Well, we don't know for
sure, but it looks like it.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.706
Jenna, if you're not
comfortable going in,

12:30.750 --> 12:31.881
you don't have to.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.535
No, I'll do it.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.190
I want to keep any suspicion
off me and Shareen.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.061
Besides, I-I can't afford
to lose this job.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.889
Not if I'm gonna get Cody back.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.412
Where is he now?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.806
Uh, he's with his dad
and his grandmother.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.417
They have a house in Michigan.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.724
With a yard.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.813
I couldn't afford to pay rent
on the studio apartment we had

12:50.857 --> 12:52.336
with what I make here.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.991
It's why I got evicted,

12:55.035 --> 12:57.646
why I had to give up
on nursing school.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.605
Why the judge
gave custody to my ex.

13:00.649 --> 13:03.260
You know, sometimes
I think Cody's better off.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.785
I know you don't believe that.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.007
Well, I better
get in there, hmm?

13:11.051 --> 13:13.314
Hey.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.794
If you change your mind

13:14.837 --> 13:17.971
or if you feel in any danger,
you call.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.363
Okay?
Okay.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.843
All right.
Thank you.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.366
Sure.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.469
Hey, Jenna.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.862
Tell Shar thanks a lot.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.473
God forbid I should
get a day off.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.866
Where are you going, Jenna?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.085
Uh, to punch in.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.477
Shareen called in sick,

13:46.521 --> 13:48.305
but I suppose you
already know that.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.220
Yeah, she said
she wasn't feeling well.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.222
Seemed okay
yesterday.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.745
Anything happen last night?

13:53.789 --> 13:55.051
What?

13:55.095 --> 13:56.487
You two left together,
didn't you?

13:56.531 --> 13:58.838
Yeah, we walk
to the subway together.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.970
You didn't see
her after that?No.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.754
Then how'd you know
she called in sick?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.321
Lyle.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.584
Didn't you want to get
another register open?

14:06.628 --> 14:09.109
Let the lady punch in
and get her drawer.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.590
Register three.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.205
Thanks, Bernie.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.555
Keep your head down.
He's in a mood today.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.253
Go get your drawer.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.522
You stuff your pockets
in the middle of a job?

14:31.566 --> 14:33.873
He's been skimming us
this whole time.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.489
ROBYN
How'd it go?

14:41.532 --> 14:44.013
I owe a guy Knicks tickets,
but we got a bite.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.929
The bullet was traced back to
a gun used in another burglary.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.933
Four months ago at the Herndon
Manufacturing plant.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.761
Manufacturing plant?

14:52.804 --> 14:55.590
That doesn't sound like a cash
robbery. What did they take?

14:55.633 --> 14:58.419
I don't have much more because
the Feds took over the case.

14:58.462 --> 15:01.117
Feds? What does Herndon make?

15:01.161 --> 15:04.425
According to the Internet,
dyes, resins, waxes.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.209
So why would the Feds
be involved?

15:06.253 --> 15:08.951
Not sure. I called a detective
friend who was on the case

15:08.995 --> 15:10.910
before the Feds took it over.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.347
He said it was all
very hush-hush,

15:13.390 --> 15:16.263
but he did remember
interviewing a witness.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.614
A former employee
named Gordon Racine.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.311
Quit Herndon just
after the burglary

15:21.355 --> 15:22.965
and opened a shop of his own.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.011
Can you tell me
where the shop is?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.448
Only if I can meet you there.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.406
I thought you weren't
a cop anymore.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.975
Maybe I want to see
where this leads.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.152
Nah, you just want my name.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.687
Gordon Racine?How can I help you folks?

15:49.731 --> 15:53.343
We were hoping to talk to you
about the burglary at Herndon.

15:53.387 --> 15:54.562
Hang on.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.259
Did you, did you catch them?

15:58.653 --> 16:00.089
You're cops, right?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.961
No.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.441
But a friend of ours may have
had a run-in with the same guys.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.314
I feel for them. That was
the worst night of my life.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.663
You mind telling us about it?

16:08.706 --> 16:11.405
Um, I, uh, I worked I.T.
for the plant,

16:11.448 --> 16:13.755
sometimes late. That
night I heard noises.

16:13.798 --> 16:17.498
And when I came out of
my office, this guy grabs me,

16:17.541 --> 16:20.544
shoves a gun in my mouth
and says if I make a sound,

16:20.588 --> 16:22.851
he's-he's gonna
blow my brains out.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.374
How many guys were there?

16:24.418 --> 16:25.767
Three total.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.290
They nearly killed
the security guard

16:27.334 --> 16:29.075
who tried to stop them--
Not that anybody cared.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.120
I tried to take a few days off
after it happened,

16:31.164 --> 16:32.600
just to get my head together,

16:32.643 --> 16:35.603
and management
threatened to fire me.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.127
Some American
dream, huh?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.608
$20 an hour
and a gun in your face.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.218
Makes you think.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.785
I'm sure it does.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.788
I quit right there,
opened up this shop.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.137
Can you describe the men?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.660
Mm, they wore masks.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.445
The only thing I saw
with clarity was the gun.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.576
Well, what'd they steal?

16:52.620 --> 16:53.969
Management didn't say.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.275
Probably didn't want it
getting back

16:55.318 --> 16:56.319
to the big companies
they sell to.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.538
VIP accounts.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.714
Government contracts.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.282
I know Herndon
makes resins and dyes.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.979
Is there a chance they make ink?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.285
Yeah, there's a whole division.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.896
Did you ever come
across the initials

17:07.939 --> 17:10.072
B.E.P. on the VIP
account list?

17:10.116 --> 17:14.033
Yeah, um, as a matter of fact,
I did. Why?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.774
Not important.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.820
Appreciate your help, Gordon.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.564
B.E.P. What's that?

17:23.607 --> 17:25.087
A hunch. I'll let you know
if it pays off,

17:25.131 --> 17:26.915
but I got to check
on something first.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.191
You find everything okay?

17:42.235 --> 17:43.975
Yes, thank you.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.022
And Shareen? She okay?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.545
She will be.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.156
How about you? How you doing?

17:55.335 --> 17:58.555
My manager Lyle, he's been
asking a lot of questions.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.817
But he's a real
stickler for the rules.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.777
Not the type to... you know.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.126
You sure?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.823
Because we can
pull you out of here.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.130
No, if I left now, Lyle would
ask even more questions.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.437
Just tell me
you found something.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.743
We're working on it.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.181
I'll be back before
the end of your shift.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.487
$13.89.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.662
Thank you.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
Hey, can you break this for me?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.013
Thanks.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.236
Thank you.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.766
For the boys.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.986
You knew I followed you?

18:38.029 --> 18:41.642
I mean, well, y-you're good,
but I'm better.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.210
So, what's this hunch?

18:44.253 --> 18:47.996
Federal involvement.
Factory makes ink.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.694
I think I know what those guys
stole from the plant that night.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.485
B.E.P.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.922
Bureau of Engraving
and Printing.

19:00.965 --> 19:04.099
Herndon Manufacturing
supplies ink for U.S. currency.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.323
So, this is about
counterfeiting?

19:10.366 --> 19:12.194
Yeah, that's why
there was no money was missing.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.892
They weren't stealing it,
they were exchanging it.

19:14.936 --> 19:18.113
Taking real bills and
replacing them with fake ones.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.680
Well, that's how
they clean their cash.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.509
And the big chain
store isn't any wiser.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.032
I mean, they come
across a phony,

19:24.075 --> 19:25.599
they assume a customer
just slipped it to them.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.817
And to avoid suspicion,
they funnel the fakes

19:26.861 --> 19:28.471
through different stores,

19:28.515 --> 19:30.386
not hitting the same ones
too frequently.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.259
Well, they must have a system
for picking their targets.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.174
Well, Dante's gonna give
some bills to a friend of his

19:35.217 --> 19:38.525
at the Secret Service, so we'll
see if they can shed some light.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.658
Dante's helping you out
with this, is he?

19:42.703 --> 19:43.834
He's got some time to kill.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.749
Oh, I bet he does, yeah.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.447
Look, what we do know

19:47.490 --> 19:49.623
is that that they have
a man on the inside.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.320
Now, if we can
figure out who that is,

19:51.364 --> 19:53.583
then we can use them
to get to the crew.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.976
I'm sure they're
not that different

19:55.019 --> 19:56.630
from Jenna and Shareen.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.110
In debt. Desperate.

19:59.154 --> 20:02.026
Overleveraged.
Looking for a way out.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.377
Oh, you just described
the entire staff of this place.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.424
Everybody there is either
strapped or working an angle.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.643
You got a cashier here

20:09.686 --> 20:11.601
who's on the verge
of bankruptcy.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.734
A stock boy who started
a GoFundMe account

20:13.777 --> 20:15.692
'cause his brother got jumped.

20:15.736 --> 20:19.043
And their manager over there is
being crushed by student loans.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.958
I mean, if these counterfeiters
are looking for somebody

20:21.002 --> 20:23.352
to leverage or bribe,
the possibilities are endless.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.441
So which one of them is it?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.530
Yeah, and how deeply
involved are they?

20:30.229 --> 20:33.406
Here you go. Have a good day.Thank you.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.870
Jenna, you okay?

21:02.913 --> 21:04.915
I saw him. The shooter was here.

21:04.959 --> 21:05.960
Are you sure?

21:06.003 --> 21:07.657
I knew I'd seen him before.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.051
He's the delivery guy
for Bolt Blast Energy Drinks.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.445
And I just saw him talking
to my jerk-ass manager.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.274
Here, I took a photo.
I'll send it to you now.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.668
Is he still there?

21:18.712 --> 21:20.322
No, he left.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.498
Okay, I'm gonna send my friend
Mel to come pick you up.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.848
No, no. I don't think
they know it was me

21:24.892 --> 21:26.372
and Shareen here last night.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.896
If I leave now,
it'll just look suspicious.

21:28.939 --> 21:32.116
I can't lose this job.
I think I'm good.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.989
Jenna.Just come get me after my shift?

21:35.032 --> 21:37.513
Don't do anything to draw
attention to yourself.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.819
Keep your phone close.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.995
And if anything goes wrong,
call me.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.258
I will. I got to go.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.088
Lyle.No phones allowed on the floor.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.873
That's the rule.I'm sorry, it was an emergency.

21:49.917 --> 21:50.874
My kid.Hand it over.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.528
What?

21:52.572 --> 21:54.661
You can have it back
at the end of your shift.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.316
Lyle.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.621
She's not a child.

21:58.665 --> 21:59.970
She doesn't have
to give you her phone.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.407
She does if she wants
to keep her job.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.756
But you're right.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.758
It's her choice.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.990
Got him.
The shooter?

22:20.034 --> 22:21.296
Yeah, I hacked
Bolt Blast Energy.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
The guy's name is Nick Gleeson.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.995
He's been working
for the company for
a little over a year.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.998
Company's known for offering
second chances to ex-cons.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.304
Well, he sure
learned his lesson.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.045
What was he in for?

22:31.088 --> 22:33.569
Burglary, larceny, check fraud.
He started in, uh, juvie.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.397
He's done a couple
of stints in state.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.877
And graduated to counterfeiting.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.400
It's hard to believe
a street thug like Nick

22:38.444 --> 22:39.836
could've created those bills.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.925
Well, they were damn good fakes.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.362
Yeah, as good as the ones
coming out of Peru,

22:43.405 --> 22:44.798
which has specialized artisans

22:44.841 --> 22:46.626
making the best fakes
on the planet.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.193
If Nick was the shooter,
he was the muscle,

22:49.237 --> 22:51.370
not the brains.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.676
If we're gonna protect
Jenna and Shareen,

22:53.720 --> 22:55.635
we're gonna have to break up
this whole ring.

22:55.678 --> 22:59.116
And find out who his connection
is on the inside of Dollar One.

23:00.770 --> 23:01.728
Harry, do me a favor.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.730
Track down Nick Gleeson.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.732
And check NYPD files
for known associates.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.386
Yep.

23:08.691 --> 23:11.085
Hey, Miles. How's our patient?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.870
Might want to get over here.
She's awake.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.786
What's your interest in this?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.440
Last I heard,
you quit the force.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.137
Just helping out a buddy.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.357
What, out of
the goodness of your heart?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.880
I had some spare time.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.927
Right. Look, I know
P.I. work when I see it.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.021
Your pal's on to something.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.588
These bills
are definitely counterfeit.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.024
Part of a batch
that started hitting the streets

23:37.067 --> 23:38.460
about three months ago.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.027
Some of the best I ever seen.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.463
Do you know who's behind this?

23:41.507 --> 23:44.118
Not yet, but we will.

23:44.161 --> 23:46.337
I got one of their
ring members on ice.

23:46.381 --> 23:47.730
Caught him with $200
of these same bills

23:47.774 --> 23:49.819
in sequential order
about two months ago.

23:49.863 --> 23:53.301
Problem is is he's loyal.
Won't give up his crew.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.521
You think you can get me on the
visitor's list to talk to him?

23:55.564 --> 23:56.957
Whatever
leads I get,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.089
I'll share. It's a win-win.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.311
Okay.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.921
Since you have
so much spare time.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.592
She asked if her girlfriend
was all right

24:23.636 --> 24:26.073
and if you had caught
the men that shot her.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.119
So you gonna tell me
what this is about?

24:29.163 --> 24:31.992
Like I said,
I'm just helping out a friend.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.472
This woman doesn't
even know your name.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.952
Robyn, I
need to know

24:35.996 --> 24:37.606
what I'm dealing with
so I can protect myself.

24:39.434 --> 24:40.740
And more importantly, I need
to know that you're not putting

24:40.783 --> 24:41.958
my daughter at risk.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.656
Our daughter.
And Delilah is safer

24:43.699 --> 24:45.571
with me than she is with anyone.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.137
You of all people
should know that.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.748
Or did you forget

24:48.791 --> 24:51.664
how my unit protected your
medical team from incursions?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.100
20 years ago,

24:53.143 --> 24:54.971
thousands of miles
away from home

24:55.015 --> 24:56.756
and long before
Delilah was even born.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.714
And you were lying
to me then, too.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.150
It was my job.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.283
You're still angry.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.502
And you're still selfish.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.984
How much does Delilah
really know about you?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.988
I told her what she was
ready to hear.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.294
And if I'm guessing,
that was right around the time

25:13.337 --> 25:14.948
her friend was killed?

25:14.991 --> 25:18.473
That week she came here,
wouldn't even leave her room?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.562
Robyn, she used to talk to us
about everything,

25:20.606 --> 25:24.218
what's going on at school,
what's going on at home.

25:24.261 --> 25:25.567
Now it's like she's scared

25:25.611 --> 25:27.308
she's gonna say something
she shouldn't.

25:27.351 --> 25:30.093
You are so quick to blame.

25:30.137 --> 25:33.140
But I'm not the only one who was
keeping secrets from Dee.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.971
But Miles,

25:38.014 --> 25:40.277
isn't losing a friend
in a drive-by shooting

25:40.321 --> 25:43.498
enough to change a child?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.414
She's been struggling
for months with PTSD.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.590
You know how real that is.

25:48.634 --> 25:53.769
Robyn, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

25:53.813 --> 25:57.817
What are you involved with
so close to home?

25:59.122 --> 26:01.385
Nothing that would
harm our daughter.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.476
I'm-a come back tonight
and get Shareen

26:05.520 --> 26:07.304
and move her to a safe place.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.394
Thank you.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.528
What you got?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.008
Hey. I found Nick Gleeson.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.754
Yo. Who the hell are you?

26:21.797 --> 26:23.407
Karma. I'm here to talk to you

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
about that guy
you murdered last night.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.063
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.456
Sure, you do, Nick.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.936
And you're also gonna
tell me all about

26:29.979 --> 26:31.677
your little
counterfeiting operation, too.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.908
I'm telling you
like I told the Feds,

26:45.952 --> 26:48.128
I've got nothing
to do with this.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.870
Then how'd you end up
with that much counterfeit cash?

26:50.913 --> 26:52.567
Hell if I know.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.482
One minute I'm picking up milk
for my kid's cereal,

26:54.525 --> 26:56.876
I walk out and next thing
I know I'm in a squad car.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.356
And because
I couldn't make bail,

26:59.400 --> 27:00.923
I lost my job.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.838
My car got repossessed.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.666
My wife had to ask
her parents for money

27:04.710 --> 27:06.102
to keep from getting evicted.

27:06.146 --> 27:09.105
Look, I'm not a cop.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.281
You can be straight with me.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.457
Do you have any idea
how you may have gotten

27:13.501 --> 27:14.981
the counterfeit money?

27:15.024 --> 27:16.852
For the last time, no.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.898
Getting slipped a
fake 20 is one thing,

27:18.941 --> 27:21.030
but hundreds in fakes
suggests you're involved.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.121
Do you shop
at Dollar One?
No.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.733
Trey, the Feds aren't messing
around. This is your life.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.909
And with your priors...From ten years ago.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.650
They don't care.
They will let you rot in here.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.348
Haven't you
lost enough?

27:34.391 --> 27:35.741
What about your son?

27:35.784 --> 27:37.003
Think about your family.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.658
I am thinking about my family.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.314
Who are you protecting?

27:49.406 --> 27:50.973
Hey, Dante. What's up?

27:51.017 --> 27:52.366
I think I just got a lead.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.629
Well, good,
'cause I just lost one.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.198
The guy in possession
of the fake bills?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.853
Turns out his wife cashed
a check at this grocery.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.246
He was taking the fall
in order to protect her.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.161
Who said chivalry is dead?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.772
If the cash came
from this store,

28:06.815 --> 28:08.643
there may be a common
link to Dollar One.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.689
Maybe the same delivery guy.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.343
It's a great way to case
a place, get a sense of routine,

28:13.387 --> 28:14.823
groom an inside man.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.695
I don't think it was Nick.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.045
The beverages he delivers
aren't sold here.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.960
My team checked.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.831
But maybe one
of the other ring members does.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.441
Maybe.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.229
Uh, sorry, no. Never seen him.

28:29.272 --> 28:32.754
I just received some photos
of known associates.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.495
Would you mind
taking a look at them?

28:36.105 --> 28:37.019
No.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.067
Uh, yeah.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.198
Yeah, that one.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.983
It's, uh, it's Brody Mavers.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.028
Yeah, he was here
about a week as a,

28:46.072 --> 28:48.901
eh, fill-in stock clerk
before he quit.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.772
Thanks for your help.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.948
Looks like you've got
another lead.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.384
I'd run background
for you, but...

28:54.428 --> 28:55.777
No, I got it.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.213
But first, I want
to check with my client

28:57.257 --> 28:58.562
to see if Brody
was there that night.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.444
Lyle, they need you
down in inventory.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.315
Said there's a problem
with a shipment.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.238
Jenna.

29:25.546 --> 29:28.288
You owe me for this one.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.811
Bernie, you're gonna
get us both fired.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.508
You shouldn't be
on break without it.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.946
And I think someone's
been trying to reach you.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.168
Everything all right?

29:39.212 --> 29:41.214
I need to respond
to this right away.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.606
Well, Lyle's on the floor.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.130
I know.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.219
Come with me.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.617
There.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.705
I'll stand watch.Thanks, Bernie.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.359
And Jenna?

29:56.403 --> 29:58.013
I'm really sorry.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.406
What?

29:59.449 --> 30:01.887
Hey! You said you
wouldn't hurt her!

30:01.930 --> 30:03.671
Stay out of this, old man!

30:11.853 --> 30:13.986
Jenna still hasn't responded
to my text.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.292
Well, maybe she's at
the register and can't answer.

30:16.336 --> 30:19.643
Maybe, but Rob, I can't get
a location off her phone.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.297
It's not connected to the
network. Maybe it's off.

30:21.341 --> 30:24.779
I told her to keep it on.
Something's wrong.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.434
I'm looking for Jenna.
Have you seen her?

30:27.477 --> 30:29.175
No.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.393
Jenna?

30:30.437 --> 30:32.004
You're looking for Jenna?Yes.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.049
I'm a friend of hers.
Do you know where she is?

30:34.093 --> 30:36.312
No, but when you find her, tell
her don't bother coming back,

30:36.356 --> 30:37.879
because she's fired.Fired?

30:37.923 --> 30:39.446
Yeah. She went on break
and never came back.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.100
I need to see
your security footage.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.318
And I need
reliable employees.

30:42.362 --> 30:45.104
Listen to me, whoever you are...

30:46.453 --> 30:48.890
No, you listen to me.
She's in danger.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.283
And it happened on your watch.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.763
So I need to see
that footage now.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.678
I don't know how to
operate the system.

30:54.722 --> 30:58.334
My assistant manager
is the one who controls it.

30:58.378 --> 31:01.903
Bernie. What
are you doing?

31:01.947 --> 31:04.036
He's deleting evidence
of Jenna's disappearance.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.865
You're the inside man.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.956
It was supposed to be simple.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.480
Take care of the cameras
and give them the access codes.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.221
Who paid you?

31:15.264 --> 31:17.571
Was it the
delivery guy Nick?

31:17.614 --> 31:19.573
My mother

31:19.616 --> 31:21.096
is 92.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.533
Having to maintain
her prescriptions,

31:23.577 --> 31:24.926
I was struggling.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.885
He said I could make

31:26.928 --> 31:28.799
some cash
and no one would get hurt.

31:28.843 --> 31:33.587
Because of what you did, Jenna
could be a lot worse than hurt.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.981
When I overheard her
on the phone

31:36.024 --> 31:38.157
saying that she recognized Nick,

31:38.200 --> 31:40.246
I thought
my life was over.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.551
So you called them.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.031
I don't know what to do.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.903
Where did they take her?

31:44.946 --> 31:47.906
I don't know. I thought they
were just gonna talk to her.

31:47.949 --> 31:51.213
But a guy I didn't
know grabbed her.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.650
He-he put her in a car.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.871
Was that him?

31:58.264 --> 32:00.179
Look, you got to know.

32:00.222 --> 32:03.399
I adore those girls.
I-I never thought...

32:03.443 --> 32:05.488
Last ping on Jenna's cell
was two blocks from the store.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.708
Yeah, the abductors must have
turned off her phone.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.318
What about Nick's?It's a burner.

32:09.362 --> 32:10.711
It's off-network, too.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.148
Meaning we have
no way to track her.

32:19.589 --> 32:22.114
Okay, I'm gonna
need you to think.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.507
Is there anything you remember

32:24.551 --> 32:25.813
that could help me
track her down?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.468
A license plate number,

32:28.511 --> 32:29.991
something distinctive
about the car?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.514
No.Anything about
the phone call?

32:31.558 --> 32:34.430
Uh, something Nick
might have said?

32:34.474 --> 32:36.955
Bernie! Do you know what they
are going to do to her?

32:36.998 --> 32:39.218
They are going to torture her
and kill her

32:39.261 --> 32:40.871
if they haven't done it already.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.351
Now I need you to think.

32:42.395 --> 32:46.877
The phone call was quick.
Nick didn't say...

32:46.921 --> 32:49.271
B-But...
But what?

32:49.315 --> 32:52.883
I heard music in the background
when Nick was on the phone.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.886
It sounded like...
opera?

33:02.197 --> 33:04.286
Rob, you were right. Nick, Brody

33:04.330 --> 33:05.461
and Gordon are connected.

33:05.505 --> 33:06.897
How?

33:06.941 --> 33:07.942
They all grew up
in the same public housing.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.248
Gordon almost made it out.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.466
He was a high school standout.

33:10.510 --> 33:11.990
He got into MIT

33:12.033 --> 33:13.643
for engineering,
but he couldn't afford to go.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.777
Instead, he, uh, he just got
a job as an I.T. tech, working

33:16.820 --> 33:19.040
far below his potential.So Gordon's the brains.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.824
We're guessing

33:20.868 --> 33:23.131
when his old pals found out
he was working at Herndon,

33:23.175 --> 33:25.394
they convinced him to put
his engineering skills to use,

33:25.438 --> 33:27.962
counterfeiting the perfect bill.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.139
So the story about the robbery
at the plant was a cover.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.315
Gordon was in on it.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.969
Harry, what were
you able to find out

33:35.013 --> 33:36.710
about that computer shop?

33:36.753 --> 33:38.842
Yeah, the store front's just
a small part of the space.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.975
There's a much larger
storage area in the back.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.716
Yeah, it's closed off,
it's discrete.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.762
It's the perfect place
to run their operation from.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.982
And the perfect place
to hold Jenna.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.290
Where's your partner, huh?

33:51.333 --> 33:52.204
And who's that woman
that attacked me?

33:52.247 --> 33:54.336
I told you. I don't know.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.599
No, no, Nick, Nick, stop,
stop. We agreed, no violence.Oh, my God.

33:56.643 --> 33:57.992
Are you kidding me, man?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.428
Look, these bitches,
they saw us.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.082
All right?
They saw me smoke Rudy,

34:01.126 --> 34:03.563
so if we don't get rid of her
and the other girl,

34:03.606 --> 34:04.999
we all go to prison.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.522
Is that what you want?No, no, but what if

34:06.566 --> 34:07.958
she really doesn't know
where her friend is?

34:08.002 --> 34:09.830
We shot the woman. I mean...

34:09.873 --> 34:11.397
What, you think she just left
her on the sidewalk to bleed?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.703
No. No, no, no. She knows, okay?

34:13.747 --> 34:15.096
She knows.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.184
Well, what if we find
the other one,

34:16.228 --> 34:17.316
get them to agree not to talk?

34:18.882 --> 34:21.059
Yeah, we should, like,
draw up a contract,

34:21.102 --> 34:22.886
have them sign it, right?

34:22.930 --> 34:25.585
Like, how-- Come on, how can
someone so smart be so stupid?

34:25.628 --> 34:27.630
Come on, look, look.

34:27.674 --> 34:30.068
We got a good thing
going on here, right?

34:30.111 --> 34:31.547
And I, for one,
I'm not gonna let

34:31.591 --> 34:33.462
a couple Dollar One cashiers
ruin that for us.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.247
They know about the
counterfeiting, Gordy.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.596
The woman who attacked Nick
asked you about the B.E.P.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.554
Mm-hmm.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.730
So this threat, this
needs to be handled.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.298
Like you handled Rudy?I did what I had to do.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.518
Because you don't cross
your partners.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.086
Maybe you're right.
Maybe she doesn't know anything.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.784
So maybe I should just put
a bullet in her skull

34:50.827 --> 34:52.786
and end this right now.

34:52.829 --> 34:55.484
Do it and you're next.Yo.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.051
Put the gun down.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.314
You put yours down
or I'll blow her head off.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.977
Come on, Nick. Don't be stupid.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.631
Put the gun down.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.502
All right, yeah, you're
not a cop, so who are you?

35:13.546 --> 35:15.069
I'm just someone
who doesn't want to see

35:15.113 --> 35:17.071
an innocent person die.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.507
Jenna, you will
be all right.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.074
You take another step
and she won't be.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.294
Nick, Nick, it's over.
Just let her go.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.296
No, I'm not going
back to prison.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.820
And I am done breaking
my back for minimum wage.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.038
Brody, get the cash.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.692
Don't do it.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.173
It doesn't matter.
I am walking out of here

35:32.217 --> 35:33.435
with the cash.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.089
All right, you...

35:35.133 --> 35:38.092
Nick.You're gonna put the money

35:38.136 --> 35:41.008
in this bag. Now!

35:42.575 --> 35:44.881
Did you know the CEO of
Bolt Blast Energy Drinks

35:44.925 --> 35:46.927
made $7 million
last year?

35:46.970 --> 35:48.929
And guys like us,
we're barely making it.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.278
How is that right?

35:50.322 --> 35:52.324
I'm not going
back to that life.

35:52.367 --> 35:55.327
I worked too hard
to let all this go.

35:55.370 --> 35:58.112
So I will drop you all

35:58.156 --> 36:00.201
a postcard from México.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.602
You okay, Jenna?

36:09.645 --> 36:10.733
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.915
Ah!

36:18.959 --> 36:21.135
Come on.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.930
Looks like I owe you one.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.932
Just a private citizen
doing my part.

36:35.976 --> 36:39.371
Oh, don't give me that.
No, you got cop in your bones.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.111
You should give up
this P.I. nonsense,

36:41.155 --> 36:43.201
do something worthwhile.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.115
Join us big boys in the Service.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.030
I can put in a good word.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.641
Thanks.

36:48.684 --> 36:51.818
I'm not looking for another
badge right now,

36:51.861 --> 36:53.863
but there is something
you can do for me.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.519
What's that?

37:04.787 --> 37:05.832
Hey.

37:21.587 --> 37:22.544
It's over.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.416
We're safe now.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.852
What about your job?

37:25.895 --> 37:28.507
Lyle fired me, so...

37:28.550 --> 37:31.901
Actually, it's Lyle
who's gonna be out of a job.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.948
The store was being used to
distribute counterfeit money.

37:34.991 --> 37:37.124
And it happened on Lyle's watch.

37:37.167 --> 37:40.127
Can't imagine the owners
will be too happy about that.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.782
Let's get you home
so you can recover.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.305
You ready? Okay.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.526
One, two, there you go.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.626
Thank you for stepping up.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.629
I took an oath.

38:03.672 --> 38:06.980
I'd appreciate you not taking
advantage of that again.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.677
I got a family to think about.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.247
You do, too.

38:29.176 --> 38:32.310
Hey, thanks for the
assist back there.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.834
I guess the shoulder and the
knee are getting better, huh?

38:34.877 --> 38:37.967
I'm gonna pay for it
tomorrow, trust me.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.319
But the Secret Service
was quite appreciative.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.408
And you were able to keep
my clients out of it?

38:43.451 --> 38:46.846
Unfortunately, no.

38:46.889 --> 38:50.153
Turns out the Feds were
offering a $10,000 reward.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.939
I might've mentioned that Jenna
was the one who tipped me off.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.118
Enough to get Jenna and Shareen

38:58.161 --> 39:00.903
back on their feet.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.776
As long as the Secret Service
is paying,

39:03.819 --> 39:05.604
I believe it's your turn?

39:05.647 --> 39:07.997
Hmm.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.608
Would you look at the time?

39:09.651 --> 39:11.436
So you backing out on me?

39:12.437 --> 39:13.786
Come on.

39:13.829 --> 39:14.830
A deal's a deal.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.093
What's your name?

39:22.795 --> 39:24.318
Robyn.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.627
My name is Robyn.

39:34.937 --> 39:37.375
Nice to finally meet you, Robyn.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.612
What are y'all still doing up?

39:57.656 --> 39:59.353
We were worried about you.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.702
Neither of us

40:00.746 --> 40:03.183
can sleep until we
know you're home,

40:03.226 --> 40:05.141
safe and in one piece.

40:05.185 --> 40:06.534
Wow.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.971
I'm here.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.582
It's all good.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.845
Now. Right this minute.

40:12.888 --> 40:16.544
I mean, Mom, you
tell us not to worry,

40:16.588 --> 40:18.938
but you also said
that Mr. Bishop was the best.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.200
Look at what happened to him.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.984
We know you can take care

40:22.028 --> 40:25.466
of yourself,
but you're not invulnerable.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.816
I promise you,

40:27.860 --> 40:31.472
if I'm ever in real danger,
I will let you know.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.648
Now, where is all this
coming from?

40:41.874 --> 40:43.353
Dad called.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.010
And what did he want?

40:48.054 --> 40:50.622
He wants to know
if she feels safe

40:50.665 --> 40:52.362
in this house.

40:52.406 --> 40:55.496
And he asked if there was
anything he should know,

40:55.540 --> 40:58.107
about what you may
be involved in.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.502
And what did you say?

41:01.546 --> 41:03.591
What do you think I said?

41:05.941 --> 41:07.203
I lied.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.991
Just be safe, okay?

41:15.037 --> 41:16.865
I love you.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.519
Love you, too, babe.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.521
Get some sleep.

41:25.570 --> 41:29.791
She lied... to protect me?

41:33.882 --> 41:35.754
She shouldn't have to do that.

41:35.797 --> 41:38.800
And it won't be the last time
she has to do that, either.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.501
Come on,
you know Miles.

41:43.544 --> 41:46.895
That man is like
a dog with a bone.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.245
He's not gonna let this go.
