Hey!

00:21.349 --> 00:22.801
Is anyone there?

00:23.133 --> 00:24.880
Look, I need some help in here!

00:37.183 --> 00:38.197
<i>All right...</i>

00:38.626 --> 00:41.738
<i>look. I know you're probably panicking
right now, but there's no time for that.</i>

00:41.818 --> 00:44.269
<i>You need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering</i>

00:45.286 --> 00:46.701
<i>who tied you to the desk.</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:49.337
<i>Well, the truth is, it was you.</i>

00:50.041 --> 00:51.337
<i>I mean, me.</i>

00:52.555 --> 00:54.902
<i>I did it because
I needed you to get this message.</i>

00:55.507 --> 00:58.214
<i>It would take too long to give you
the explanation, and you wouldn't</i>

00:58.294 --> 01:01.719
<i>remember it anyway so you're just going
to have to trust me on this. Now,</i>

01:02.580 --> 01:05.519
<i>You'll find a knife taped
to the underside of your chair.</i>

01:06.489 --> 01:08.366
<i>Find it, and cut yourself loose.</i>

01:12.111 --> 01:13.975
<i>Now, I need you to listen.</i>

01:14.614 --> 01:18.100
<i>It is vitally important
that you find this woman.</i>

01:25.101 --> 01:28.032
<i>I don't know where she is,
but you have to find her. She can help.</i>

01:28.143 --> 01:32.095
<i>Check the mess hall, maybe they took her
to the brig, I don't know. Keep looking.</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:33.950
<i>Don't worry about anything else.</i>

01:34.165 --> 01:35.895
<i>And for God's sake, don't trust anyone.</i>

01:35.975 --> 01:39.326
<i>Just find her and do it fast, because
if you don't, hundreds of people</i>

01:39.406 --> 01:41.847
<i>are going to die. Including you.</i>

02:59.870 --> 03:00.874
Katie!

03:02.523 --> 03:03.545
Rodney!

03:03.738 --> 03:06.109
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I heard you were back, and

03:06.220 --> 03:08.594
- I hadn't seen you for a while, so...
- Yeah, I know.

03:08.674 --> 03:10.553
We have this whole new mainland
to explore,

03:10.642 --> 03:12.627
and I've been bringing
back samples all week.

03:12.707 --> 03:14.483
So I see. Anything interesting?

03:14.966 --> 03:17.850
Well, it's all pretty similar
to what we found back on Lantia.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.473
We found a few new species.

03:19.679 --> 03:22.545
Oh, which reminds me,
I've got a surprise for you.

03:29.524 --> 03:31.874
I found this guy
hiding in some shrubbery.

03:32.969 --> 03:34.080
What is that?

03:34.179 --> 03:37.376
Well, it doesn't have a name yet
but I'm thinking of calling it...

03:38.727 --> 03:40.479
Rodneyana Villosa.

03:41.078 --> 03:42.089
After you.

03:43.239 --> 03:44.242
Really?

03:44.576 --> 03:46.464
- What... you can do that?
- Yeah.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.280
Be careful.

03:49.703 --> 03:51.491
The bristles will pierce skin.

03:53.329 --> 03:55.024
Anyway, look, I wondered if I could...

03:55.104 --> 03:58.170
you know, tear you away from all of this
long enough to have some lunch?

03:58.252 --> 04:01.409
Oh, I would love to, but...

04:02.524 --> 04:04.391
I think I'm coming down with something.

04:04.757 --> 04:07.082
I have a headache,
and I've had a few dizzy spells,

04:07.162 --> 04:09.098
so I was thinking of going down
to the infirmary.

04:12.209 --> 04:13.631
Well, I'll come with you.

04:14.576 --> 04:15.955
No, you don't have to do that.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.218
I know how much you hate
being around sick people.

04:19.065 --> 04:20.820
No, really, it's fine.

04:21.563 --> 04:23.650
Oh, that is so sweet.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.654
- Thanks.
- After you.

04:33.867 --> 04:35.537
Dr. Brown...

04:35.617 --> 04:37.462
I see you've brought
my number one patient.

04:37.542 --> 04:40.509
What? Oh, no, we're not here
for me this time. I'm-I'm here for her.

04:40.956 --> 04:42.474
Okay, well, what can I do for you?

04:42.554 --> 04:45.781
Well, I've got this really bad headache
that won't go away, and

04:45.878 --> 04:47.678
I feel kind of dizzy.

04:48.311 --> 04:51.373
- When did you first notice it?
- Some time this morning. Why?

04:51.618 --> 04:54.758
Well because you're the fourth person to
come in here with those exact symptoms

04:54.869 --> 04:57.450
and the second person
from the botany department.

04:58.982 --> 05:00.954
Gerald? Hey...

05:01.445 --> 05:03.937
- Who's that?
- Gerald Baxter. He's on my team.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.727
You've met him before.

05:06.509 --> 05:08.132
He's got the bug collection?

05:09.176 --> 05:11.577
Oh, sure, right, yeah. I remember now.

05:12.857 --> 05:14.585
Well, I'm gonna need to take some blood.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.350
- You, too, Doctor.
- What?

05:16.695 --> 05:19.938
If there is something going around, you
might have been exposed to it as well.

05:20.658 --> 05:21.666
Sorry.

05:23.165 --> 05:26.872
Major Dorsey and his team
just returned from M6R-214.

05:27.569 --> 05:30.659
They examined the debris field above
the planet and found the parts from one,

05:30.739 --> 05:33.518
- possibly two, Replicator ships.
- It was just a matter of time before

05:33.598 --> 05:35.806
the Wraith got organized
and started hitting back.

05:35.886 --> 05:38.874
I suppose. They did
defeat the Ancients, after all.

05:39.057 --> 05:40.803
The Replicators may
look like the Ancients

05:40.892 --> 05:44.133
and they may use the same technology but
they're gonna be tougher to put down.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.644
<i>Colonel Carter, come in, please.</i>

05:47.149 --> 05:48.170
Go ahead, Doctor.

05:48.256 --> 05:49.946
<i>I've got a situation developing.</i>

05:50.026 --> 05:53.026
<i>Be advised I've imposed a quarantine
on the entire infirmary level.</i>

05:53.925 --> 05:55.805
<i>- What's going on?
- 11 patients</i>

05:55.938 --> 05:57.600
<i>have shown up here in the last hour,</i>

05:57.680 --> 06:01.065
complaining of headache and dizziness.
Eight of them are from the survey teams

06:01.184 --> 06:04.106
- <i>that just got back from the mainland.</i>
- Any idea what's wrong with them?

06:04.291 --> 06:07.981
I ran some blood tests and found
a bacteria I've never seen before. I'm

06:08.115 --> 06:09.892
<i>checking it against
the Ancient database.</i>

06:10.008 --> 06:11.288
What do you want us to do?

06:11.368 --> 06:14.595
The first thing we need to do is isolate
everyone that went to the mainland

06:14.675 --> 06:17.862
and have them report to Dr Neves
in the auxiliary med lab for testing.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.332
<i>Will do. Keep us posted.</i>

06:19.412 --> 06:23.150
More test results. You and I are
both infected. So's Dr. Mckay.

06:23.312 --> 06:25.728
The good news is the most advanced case
is still only showing

06:25.808 --> 06:27.310
mild, flu-like symptoms.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.465
- Maybe it won't get worse than that.
- Yeah, let's hope so.

06:38.009 --> 06:39.016
Hello?

06:54.471 --> 06:56.371
Hey... hey, wake up.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.514
What are you doing here?

07:00.519 --> 07:02.558
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

07:03.310 --> 07:04.594
You're not a soldier.

07:04.767 --> 07:05.966
If you say so.

07:08.612 --> 07:11.811
- You should come with me. It's safer.
- No, slow down. What's going on here?

07:11.891 --> 07:14.866
It's the soldiers. They're after us.
If they catch us, they'll take us away.

07:14.946 --> 07:17.080
Take us where? What soldiers?
What is this place?

07:17.214 --> 07:19.758
- Shut up. The soldiers will hear us!
- What the hell's going on?

07:19.853 --> 07:21.415
- Why can't I remember?
- <b>I don't know.</b>

07:21.495 --> 07:23.125
- No one can.
- No one can?

07:23.922 --> 07:26.219
- You've seen others?
- Yes, one or two others,

07:26.478 --> 07:27.833
apart from the soldiers.

07:27.913 --> 07:29.914
- What about her? Was she there?
- No.

07:30.837 --> 07:32.057
I have to find her.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.227
- Why?
- I don't know. It's important.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.479
The soldiers probably
have her by now, okay?

07:36.685 --> 07:38.511
- Well, can we ask them?
- Are you crazy?

07:38.607 --> 07:40.781
If the soldiers see you,
they shoot you, take you away.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.169
Again with the taking away.

07:42.249 --> 07:44.859
- You should hide with me.
- I can't, I've to keep looking.

07:44.961 --> 07:47.977
Fine, suit yourself. If you get
yourself killed, I don't care.

07:57.318 --> 07:59.587
It started suddenly, and then it just...

07:59.668 --> 08:00.736
just stopped.

08:00.924 --> 08:03.122
Okay, well, I appreciate you telling me.

08:03.202 --> 08:04.643
Aren't you going to do anything?

08:04.978 --> 08:06.917
To be honest,
I don't see how it's relevant.

08:06.998 --> 08:09.062
It's a new symptom.
I thought it might be important.

08:09.158 --> 08:12.882
I don't see how a "tingling sensation in
your knees" relates to this condition,

08:12.963 --> 08:15.339
especially since
you're the only one experiencing it.

08:15.421 --> 08:16.676
Yeah, but, so far.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.772
I'm just saying, we don't know
anything about this disease.

08:19.852 --> 08:23.053
The best thing for you to do
right now is try to relax, okay,

08:23.134 --> 08:24.605
and let me do my work.

08:33.957 --> 08:35.698
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.115
What did Dr. Keller say?

08:43.948 --> 08:46.532
She's going to...
take it into consideration.

08:46.882 --> 08:49.636
Thanked me for my input and...
how you doing?

08:51.403 --> 08:52.222
I'm okay.

08:52.846 --> 08:55.911
Dr. Keller's got her team working pretty
hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch

08:55.991 --> 08:59.084
of stuff. I'm sure they'll come up with
a way to beat this thing in no time.

09:02.754 --> 09:03.947
Seriously, are you okay?

09:04.547 --> 09:06.369
It's... my headache.

09:06.575 --> 09:07.904
It's getting worse.

09:08.522 --> 09:09.989
Is there anything I can do?

09:11.149 --> 09:12.244
Could you...

09:12.594 --> 09:14.160
ask the nurse to bring me some tea?

09:16.810 --> 09:18.326
What's wrong with this one?

09:21.367 --> 09:22.174
Right.

09:27.447 --> 09:29.393
Marie? What's... what's going on?

09:29.536 --> 09:31.725
I don't know. I just got really dizzy.

09:38.362 --> 09:41.730
Are you telling us that the infection
has breached hazmat protocol?

09:41.922 --> 09:43.398
<i>I'm not entirely sure.</i>

09:43.671 --> 09:46.146
It's possible she could
have been previously exposed,

09:46.227 --> 09:47.843
but that would mean it's already spread

09:47.923 --> 09:50.930
much farther among
the general population than we thought.

09:51.259 --> 09:53.513
I've got off-duty medical
personnel conducting random

09:53.593 --> 09:56.525
<i>blood tests around the City
just to get a sense of where we're at.</i>

09:56.605 --> 09:58.872
Have we confirmed it came
from the mainland?

09:59.110 --> 10:02.920
The plant and soil samples brought back
by the botany department were negative,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.420
but it still seems like
the most likely point of origin.

10:05.546 --> 10:06.772
What about the database?

10:06.852 --> 10:08.965
<i>I haven't found a match yet,
but I'm still looking.</i>

10:09.638 --> 10:11.187
<i>There is one more thing.</i>

10:11.754 --> 10:14.263
Since we have no idea
what this disease does,

10:14.343 --> 10:15.676
or how it's spread,

10:15.756 --> 10:19.300
or even if our containment measures
are having any effect, I...

10:19.952 --> 10:22.896
recommend we suspend
all Gate travel immediately.

10:25.879 --> 10:27.063
Thank you, Doctor.

10:39.758 --> 10:40.762
How you feeling?

10:42.463 --> 10:43.958
I-I don't know.

10:45.132 --> 10:47.779
They brought dinner. This salisbury
steak's actually quite good.

10:47.893 --> 10:51.382
And by the way, I asked Dr. Keller
about your friend, Dr. Baxter.

10:51.681 --> 10:54.469
She says he's asleep,
but apparently the fever's down.

10:56.411 --> 10:57.214
Who?

10:57.358 --> 10:59.375
Dr. Baxter. That's his name, right,

10:59.640 --> 11:00.800
the guy on your team?

11:05.862 --> 11:06.689
Where am I?

11:08.371 --> 11:11.341
What do you mean? You're in the
infirmary. I brought you here, remember?

11:11.793 --> 11:12.779
Who are you?

11:25.951 --> 11:27.163
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

11:27.243 --> 11:29.431
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I just...

11:35.976 --> 11:37.482
Yeah, put him with the others.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.341
- Go and get him out of here.
- Yes, Sir.

11:56.469 --> 11:57.668
<i>What's the word?</i>

11:58.465 --> 12:00.474
<i>Well, the random test results came back.</i>

12:00.554 --> 12:03.869
<i>Six different people working
in six different areas of the City,</i>

12:04.041 --> 12:05.046
<i>all positive.</i>

12:05.246 --> 12:06.875
<i>That doesn't sound very promising.</i>

12:07.048 --> 12:10.211
It's either a statistical miracle,
or the entire base has been exposed.

12:10.494 --> 12:13.177
<i>We're running more tests to confirm it,
but it doesn't look good.</i>

12:13.257 --> 12:14.978
I don't know about you, but I feel fine.

12:15.058 --> 12:16.778
Me too, and that's the problem.

12:17.081 --> 12:19.188
If there is a delay
before the first symptoms appear,

12:19.268 --> 12:22.391
it could've spread anywhere
before we even knew what was happening.

12:22.535 --> 12:25.413
I've informed Stargate Command
that we're suspending Gate operations.

12:25.499 --> 12:27.979
<i>- Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller.</i>
- Go ahead.

12:28.219 --> 12:29.861
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown,

12:29.957 --> 12:33.700
as well as three other patients who are
beginning to show signs of amnesia.

12:33.924 --> 12:36.700
<i>All of them show
large concentrations of affected cells</i>

12:36.780 --> 12:38.376
<i>in the medial temporal lobe.</i>

12:38.456 --> 12:41.650
It looks like the bacteria is causing
these cells to produce a hormone

12:41.731 --> 12:44.790
that interferes with the brain's ability
to access episodic memory.

12:45.687 --> 12:47.040
How bad are we talking?

12:47.427 --> 12:50.404
Rate of deterioration seems
to vary from patient to patient,

12:50.485 --> 12:53.504
but, in all cases,
it looks like it's progressive, meaning,

12:53.584 --> 12:56.299
the longer they go without treatment,
the worse it gets.

12:57.435 --> 13:00.125
<i>Pretty soon, they won't be able
to remember their own names.</i>

13:00.206 --> 13:03.381
You said the first symptoms
were headaches and dizziness.

13:03.462 --> 13:04.610
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

13:04.691 --> 13:07.685
How long after they appeared
before the first signs of memory loss?

13:08.143 --> 13:09.668
Again, it seems to vary,

13:09.748 --> 13:13.024
but you're looking at
an average of about six hours.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.943
What about you, Doc, showing any signs?

13:15.219 --> 13:17.862
Yeah, the headaches
started half an hour ago.

13:19.175 --> 13:20.933
All right, keep searching the database.

13:21.013 --> 13:23.057
It still think it's our best bet
to find a solution.

13:23.153 --> 13:26.955
I'd love to, but if we're right about
these numbers, I'm about to get overrun

13:27.035 --> 13:30.442
<i>with a lot of new patients.
It's already pretty crowded in here.</i>

13:31.239 --> 13:32.043
Mess hall.

13:32.316 --> 13:34.226
We can clear it out
and make a temporary ward.

13:34.307 --> 13:35.904
That's a good idea. At the very least,

13:35.985 --> 13:38.675
it'll consolidate everyone
in one place for treatment.

13:38.899 --> 13:39.706
Do it.

13:57.473 --> 13:59.222
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

14:00.798 --> 14:01.798
Where am I?

14:03.056 --> 14:04.909
We were hoping you could tell us.

14:07.255 --> 14:08.611
Who are all you people?

14:09.823 --> 14:10.856
We don't know.

14:11.179 --> 14:13.167
None of us can remember anything.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.080
What's happening out there?
What did you see?

14:15.879 --> 14:16.879
Nothing.

14:17.434 --> 14:18.496
It was just...

14:19.220 --> 14:20.375
empty hallways.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.355
How did I get here?

14:22.877 --> 14:24.369
<i>The soldiers brought you.</i>

14:24.914 --> 14:25.929
Why?

14:26.506 --> 14:28.077
They bring everyone here.

14:28.364 --> 14:30.250
<i>They say it's for our own protection.</i>

14:32.058 --> 14:33.945
Don't waste your time. It won't open.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.154
Why are they doing this to us?

14:36.478 --> 14:37.949
Why can't anyone remember?

14:40.683 --> 14:41.486
My...

14:42.239 --> 14:43.243
the computer.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.096
- Where's my computer?
- It...

14:46.176 --> 14:48.619
wasn't with you when
they brought you here. Why?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.879
I have to find someone. It's a...

14:52.354 --> 14:53.381
a woman.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.558
Do you know who that is?

15:01.754 --> 15:03.176
Does anyone here know Teyla?

15:06.016 --> 15:06.819
<i>Anyone?</i>

15:10.805 --> 15:12.343
I thought this City had some sort of

15:12.429 --> 15:14.451
<i>automatic lockdown
to prevent stuff like this.</i>

15:14.535 --> 15:15.535
It does.

15:15.964 --> 15:16.968
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

15:17.485 --> 15:18.510
What happened?

15:18.590 --> 15:19.996
You're asking me?

15:21.524 --> 15:22.736
You got a headache?

15:23.647 --> 15:25.877
I guess it was just a matter of time.

15:29.091 --> 15:30.138
I'm fine.

15:33.107 --> 15:34.204
How you feeling?

15:35.416 --> 15:36.375
I am fine.

15:36.851 --> 15:39.125
- Any symptoms?
- No, none yet.

15:39.835 --> 15:40.835
Me neither.

15:43.178 --> 15:44.204
What is it?

15:44.375 --> 15:46.233
How do they know we're all infected?

15:47.194 --> 15:49.545
My blood wasn't part
of the sample that was tested.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.350
Nor was mine. Even so,
it is likely we were exposed.

15:52.802 --> 15:55.069
So? Being exposed
doesn't mean you've got it.

15:55.636 --> 15:57.801
Maybe it doesn't affect
everybody the same way,

15:57.881 --> 15:59.273
and all I know is I feel great.

16:00.658 --> 16:01.662
So do I.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.768
Perhaps you should make
Dr. Keller aware of this.

16:13.643 --> 16:14.643
Excuse me.

16:20.090 --> 16:23.297
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm a little busy right now.

16:23.821 --> 16:24.929
I'm not sick.

16:26.295 --> 16:28.124
If you're lucky enough
not to be exposed,

16:28.204 --> 16:29.709
you just blew it by coming in here.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.268
No, I know I've been exposed.

16:31.348 --> 16:33.741
People I've been working with
all day have been getting sick,

16:33.837 --> 16:36.155
but I'm not feeling anything.
Neither is teyla.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.254
You think you might have
some kind of immunity?

16:38.334 --> 16:39.360
You're the doctor.

16:40.450 --> 16:42.242
I'm going to need
a sample of your blood.

16:42.322 --> 16:43.756
Take as much as you need.

16:54.349 --> 16:55.423
What are you doing?

16:55.503 --> 16:57.179
I have to remember somehow.

16:57.385 --> 16:59.559
I already feel certain
things slipping away.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.151
- All right, now what are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.463
All right, everyone!

17:08.634 --> 17:09.634
<i>Listen up!</i>

17:10.232 --> 17:12.595
I need to escape as quickly as possible.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.599
- Does anyone know how I can do that?
- You can't just leave.

17:16.406 --> 17:18.665
- Why not?
- What about the soldiers?

17:18.744 --> 17:20.522
We're just going to have
to deal with them.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.854
I'm sorry, call me crazy,
but I don't exactly trust them.

17:22.934 --> 17:26.021
That doesn't mean we should be running
loose. We have no idea what's out there.

17:26.104 --> 17:27.731
Look, something caused this to happen,

17:29.739 --> 17:32.762
We're not gonna figure it out from in
here. Somewhere out there, there's a...

17:32.842 --> 17:34.398
a woman that...

17:35.394 --> 17:36.489
a woman named...

17:38.835 --> 17:40.012
Right, thank you.

17:40.869 --> 17:42.417
I think she knows something.

17:42.631 --> 17:43.644
What?

17:44.303 --> 17:46.326
I don't know.
We got to get out there and find out.

17:47.056 --> 17:49.235
- I think we should listen to him.
- Why?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.219
It makes sense.

17:52.392 --> 17:54.555
<i>Why haven't the soldiers
told us what's happened?</i>

17:54.764 --> 17:57.583
Why haven't there been any
announcements, or any help on the way?

17:59.813 --> 18:01.921
Maybe they don't know
any more than we do.

18:06.591 --> 18:07.752
We need a plan.

18:10.742 --> 18:11.879
They let you out?

18:11.961 --> 18:15.435
The second set of random blood tests
just came back, all positive.

18:15.518 --> 18:18.111
Didn't see much point in quarantining
the infirmary anymore.

18:18.194 --> 18:19.660
You showing any signs?

18:19.923 --> 18:21.801
- Headache?
- Yeah, same here.

18:22.329 --> 18:24.840
Five bucks says you start
losing your memories first.

18:27.361 --> 18:29.116
We've got food, water, and blankets.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.733
We don't have enough beds,
but we're just gonna have to make do.

18:31.815 --> 18:34.512
We may need to think about
ordering all non-essential personnel

18:34.592 --> 18:38.118
to report to the mess hall. 
They're gonna wind up there anyways,

18:38.213 --> 18:41.348
- we won't have people with no memories.
- That's what I'm worried about.

18:41.428 --> 18:44.595
I'll send Lorne and a team out,
make sure those orders are followed.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.221
These are from Dr. Neves.

18:47.851 --> 18:48.995
They're stimulants.

18:49.201 --> 18:51.450
He thinks they may slow
the effects of the memory loss.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.850
It's just a stopgap, but

18:52.930 --> 18:55.549
- at least it may buy us a few hours.
- Do we know what's in these?

18:55.629 --> 18:57.668
- Because I'm allergic to a lot of...
- Take it.

18:58.515 --> 19:00.360
Hand these out to Lorne and his men.

19:00.921 --> 19:02.191
One more thing.

19:02.609 --> 19:06.118
I've ordered Dr. Zelenka to remove
the Gate's main control crystal.

19:06.207 --> 19:08.392
No matter what happens,
we cannot risk spreading

19:08.472 --> 19:10.902
this disease elsewhere
in the galaxy, or to Earth.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.502
And what happens
when we all start losing our memory?

19:14.798 --> 19:17.794
Dr. Keller will come up with
something before that happens.

19:24.472 --> 19:26.584
I thought we were moving
everyone to the mess hall.

19:26.664 --> 19:30.778
He's our most advanced case. His vitals
are too unstable. What can I do for you?

19:30.977 --> 19:32.768
I was just wondering
if you found anything.

19:32.860 --> 19:33.913
What do you mean?

19:34.790 --> 19:36.773
I'm not showing
any sign of the disease, remember?

19:37.611 --> 19:41.819
Oh, well, it's possible you could have
some sort of natural immunity.

19:42.848 --> 19:43.994
- Doc...
- Stay here.

19:44.076 --> 19:45.722
I'm gonna take a sample of your blood...

19:45.802 --> 19:47.800
Doc... you've already done that.

19:50.211 --> 19:51.913
It's happening to me, isn't it?

19:52.987 --> 19:54.647
Doctor, he's convulsing!

19:58.904 --> 19:59.913
Okay...

20:00.139 --> 20:03.339
OK, give him... meda...
medazelam, four milligrams.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.139
<i>He's in V-fib. I need a crash cart.</i>

20:09.757 --> 20:11.357
Charge it to two hundred.

20:12.466 --> 20:13.466
Clear.

20:15.666 --> 20:17.430
Charge it to three hundred...

20:20.612 --> 20:21.412
Clear.

20:34.506 --> 20:35.542
<i>Go! Go!</i>

20:43.348 --> 20:44.348
This way!

20:55.442 --> 20:57.278
All right, I think we're clear.

20:57.351 --> 21:00.060
Oh, thank God!
My lungs were about to give out!

21:00.974 --> 21:02.116
So, what next?

21:02.196 --> 21:04.435
I don't know. How do we find her?

21:04.819 --> 21:05.827
Who?

21:05.996 --> 21:08.413
Teyla. The one
we just risked our lives for.

21:08.703 --> 21:10.144
Right, right.

21:10.692 --> 21:11.802
I don't know.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.291
All right, we'll just have to search
room by room. I mean,

21:15.671 --> 21:17.778
how big could this place possibly be?

21:37.347 --> 21:40.107
- Where are you taking us?
- I already told you. The mess hall.

21:40.204 --> 21:41.702
I don't want to go there.

21:41.826 --> 21:44.282
Just relax. I know you're scared,

21:44.425 --> 21:46.748
you just to have to trust me.
It's for your own good.

21:48.443 --> 21:50.205
So much for coming quietly.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.140
Hey...

21:54.212 --> 21:55.709
mess hall's this way.

21:56.955 --> 21:57.984
Right.

22:00.029 --> 22:01.583
Don't look at me that way.

22:01.663 --> 22:03.620
It's easy to get turned
around in this place.

22:09.129 --> 22:12.039
Major Lorne's picking up
some more stragglers.

22:12.237 --> 22:13.976
We're starting to get
a little resistance.

22:14.056 --> 22:15.905
Yeah, they're starting
to lose their memories.

22:15.985 --> 22:18.797
They can't understand why
there's a bunch of soldiers after them.

22:18.877 --> 22:22.228
That's why I told him to take his men to
the armory and equip them with stunners.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.748
I'm not sure I like the idea
of us shooting at our own people.

22:24.913 --> 22:26.606
Well, we may not have a choice.

22:26.688 --> 22:28.034
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

22:28.114 --> 22:31.682
Pretty soon, there's going to be
some panicked confused people out there.

22:32.183 --> 22:33.579
Okay, carry on.

22:34.795 --> 22:35.801
What?

22:36.559 --> 22:37.693
Come with me.

22:48.009 --> 22:50.250
You might want to go
easy on that stuff, Major.

22:50.332 --> 22:52.599
Sir, we need to delay this thing
as much as possible.

22:52.679 --> 22:54.281
If we all go, there's no coming back.

22:54.489 --> 22:55.492
Yeah, I know.

22:56.061 --> 22:58.726
That's what I want to talk
to you about. I got an idea.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.723
- Didn't we come this way before?
- No.

23:02.971 --> 23:04.058
Are you sure?

23:05.316 --> 23:06.325
No.

23:07.138 --> 23:08.600
I have an idea.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.568
What are you doing?

23:13.648 --> 23:16.087
If we come back here, we'll know
we've been this way before.

23:16.184 --> 23:17.758
Presuming of course that we remember

23:17.856 --> 23:20.245
that we're the ones
who put it there in the first place.

23:23.990 --> 23:25.496
I know you're out there.

23:25.634 --> 23:28.434
<i>Drop your weapons and come out slowly.</i>

23:39.477 --> 23:41.019
Little guy with glasses.

23:43.498 --> 23:45.780
- What are you doing?
- Hey, I know him.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.475
Don't shoot.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.848
I don't have any weapons.

23:51.521 --> 23:52.611
Who are you?

23:52.693 --> 23:54.683
We were captured
by the soldiers. We escaped.

23:55.696 --> 23:56.721
Really?

23:57.920 --> 23:59.044
Wait a second.

23:59.374 --> 24:00.503
What is that?

24:01.378 --> 24:02.977
- I found it.
- Let me see.

24:03.756 --> 24:05.493
- What is it?
- I don't know, but...

24:05.573 --> 24:07.049
something tells me it's important.

24:07.187 --> 24:08.198
Why?

24:08.482 --> 24:09.491
I don't know.

24:19.127 --> 24:20.581
Hey, how did you know to do that?

24:21.285 --> 24:23.411
- I don't know. I just did.
- Well, that's her, Teyla.

24:23.618 --> 24:24.706
You know her?

24:26.061 --> 24:27.893
Well, not exactly.

24:28.870 --> 24:31.064
We're looking for her.
We think she can help us.

24:33.746 --> 24:35.190
It says, "find her."

24:36.355 --> 24:38.055
How are we going to do that?

24:44.356 --> 24:46.254
This is what I wanted to show you.

24:46.656 --> 24:49.148
<i>This is the bacteria
that is causing our disease?</i>

24:49.295 --> 24:51.809
Not exactly, but it's very similar.

24:52.129 --> 24:53.824
And you found this in the database?

24:54.184 --> 24:56.345
I stopped looking in the database.

24:57.026 --> 24:59.593
<i>I knew there was a reason why
Teyla and Ronon are the only people</i>

24:59.719 --> 25:01.477
who've tested negative so far,

25:01.610 --> 25:04.272
and we don't have a lot of information
on the Satedans, so I started

25:04.352 --> 25:06.835
<i>looking through Dr. Beckett's records
on the Athosians.</i>

25:07.081 --> 25:09.908
This is a blood sample
taken from a 10-year-old boy.

25:10.024 --> 25:12.278
He was suffering
from something called...

25:15.683 --> 25:16.884
I wrote it down.

25:17.504 --> 25:18.592
Kirsan fever?

25:19.182 --> 25:20.329
Yeah, that's it.

25:21.045 --> 25:24.273
It is a common childhood ailment
throughout the galaxy.

25:24.353 --> 25:25.880
I had it when I was 8.

25:26.409 --> 25:27.582
I had it when I was 10.

25:27.662 --> 25:30.126
But this cannot be the same disease.

25:30.206 --> 25:32.830
Kirsan fever does not affect adults,
nor does it cause memory loss.

25:33.389 --> 25:35.426
Well, that may be true but...

25:35.506 --> 25:38.282
the structure of the bacteria
is too similar to ignore.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.188
They have to be related somehow.

25:40.971 --> 25:42.074
Wait a minute.

25:42.368 --> 25:43.856
Maybe they are the same.

25:43.995 --> 25:46.694
That would explain why the sensors
didn't identify it as a threat.

25:46.926 --> 25:48.941
- How is that possible?
- Well, think about it.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.572
I mean, this planet didn't have
a Stargate until we came here.

25:52.080 --> 25:56.018
<i>Maybe when the Ancients
were first scouting this place,</i>

25:56.127 --> 25:58.273
they accidentally brought this...

25:58.355 --> 26:01.624
Kirsan fever with them. It got trapped
here and over the course of 10,000 years

26:01.704 --> 26:03.903
it mutated to cause the symptoms
we're now experiencing.

26:03.983 --> 26:06.263
That would also explain
why you and Ronon aren't affected.

26:06.343 --> 26:08.460
<i>You have antibodies built
up from when you were young.</i>

26:08.540 --> 26:10.459
Well, if they have
the antibodies, then...

26:10.615 --> 26:13.679
It would take months
to reverse-engineer a cure.

26:13.759 --> 26:15.617
I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.076
The sap of the enchuri plant.

26:17.648 --> 26:20.336
<i>My people have used it for
generations to combat Kirsan fever.</i>

26:20.509 --> 26:23.093
It is highly effective
and not much is needed.

26:24.801 --> 26:26.795
- Let's go get some.
- Take a Jumper.

26:26.925 --> 26:27.931
Wait a minute.

26:28.434 --> 26:30.203
You've disabled the Gate, remember?

26:30.532 --> 26:33.896
You ordered Doctor Zelenka
to take the control crystal.

26:34.989 --> 26:36.254
Where did he put it?

26:39.835 --> 26:41.777
Zelenka, this is Sheppard. Come in.

26:43.355 --> 26:45.419
Check out the rooms
down there and there.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.811
I want this section
cleared out in ten minutes.

26:47.915 --> 26:49.120
<i>Lorne, come in.</i>

26:49.282 --> 26:51.571
- Yes, Sir, go ahead.
- <i>You seen Zelenka?</i>

26:51.848 --> 26:53.201
As a matter of fact, I have.

26:53.895 --> 26:55.628
Did you bring him to the mess hall?

26:56.252 --> 26:58.836
Sorry, Sir, but he gave us the slip.
Must have heard us coming.

26:59.235 --> 27:01.552
<i>Cracked one of my people
over the head with a metal rod and</i>

27:01.632 --> 27:04.538
disappeared down a service hatch before
I could get a shot off. There's...

27:04.630 --> 27:05.950
no telling where he is now.

27:12.315 --> 27:13.581
<i>Zelenka, respond?</i>

27:15.593 --> 27:17.032
Zelenka, come in.

27:17.674 --> 27:21.020
Radek? We are not trying to hurt you.
We need your help.

27:21.532 --> 27:25.010
OK, this is pointless. Look, we don't
even know if he still has a radio, and

27:25.090 --> 27:27.966
even if we find him, he's not gonna
remember where's the control crystal.

27:28.046 --> 27:31.598
- Let's face it: we're screwed.
- There's gotta be some way out of this.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.001
What about the Jumpers?
They've got DHDs.

27:34.096 --> 27:37.245
It doesn't matter. Without the crystal,
the Gate can't establish a wormhole.

27:37.332 --> 27:38.584
We're not going anywhere.

27:38.669 --> 27:39.935
I'm missing something.

27:40.524 --> 27:42.155
I can't concentrate.

27:42.518 --> 27:44.079
What about the mainland?

27:44.183 --> 27:45.362
Ronon is right.

27:45.483 --> 27:48.258
The enchuri plant is abundant
on many worlds. It may be here as well.

27:48.517 --> 27:49.523
All right.

27:49.613 --> 27:52.058
Assuming we can find the stuff,
how're we gonna distribute it?

27:54.278 --> 27:55.647
I'll figure something out.

27:57.407 --> 27:59.460
I'll stay with Rodney.
Do you know what to look for?

27:59.560 --> 28:00.982
It grows like a weed on Sateda.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.571
It's... right there.

28:21.857 --> 28:23.313
You can fly this thing.

28:23.393 --> 28:24.476
It's in your blood.

28:25.706 --> 28:26.595
Literally.

28:45.115 --> 28:46.276
Wait a second...

28:46.372 --> 28:47.557
what am I doing?

28:49.636 --> 28:51.548
You said, the quickest way
to spread the cure

28:51.628 --> 28:54.931
was to aerosolize it and distribute it
through the ventilation system.

28:55.019 --> 28:57.667
You are currently attempting
to override base protocol

28:57.749 --> 29:00.496
for temperature, humidity,
and air pressure.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.372
Right... right, okay, it's easy.

29:02.461 --> 29:05.531
Just a simple matter of accessing
the root directory, and...

29:06.547 --> 29:07.915
- Come on!
- Rodney...

29:08.115 --> 29:10.547
No, no, no, no.
I should be able to do this in my sleep.

29:11.925 --> 29:14.364
Oh, God...
it's happening to me too, isn't it?

29:14.511 --> 29:15.704
You have to remain calm.

29:15.829 --> 29:17.842
No, no. You don't understand.
My memory was lousy.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.423
I mean, people's names, birthdays.

29:19.566 --> 29:21.506
I once forgot mother's day
five years in a row.

29:22.046 --> 29:24.576
What is the ratio of circle's
circumference to its diameter?

29:25.423 --> 29:27.585
Well, that's pi. It's 3.14159265,
et cetera, et cetera.

29:27.746 --> 29:30.470
- That doesn't count. That's easy.
- You are a scientist, Rodney.

29:30.552 --> 29:33.451
That is what you care about. That is
what you will hang on to the longest.

29:34.817 --> 29:35.829
Right.

29:36.170 --> 29:37.305
Right, so...

29:38.533 --> 29:39.558
wait a minute.

29:40.456 --> 29:42.225
Doesn't that make me
a really bad person?

29:42.307 --> 29:45.702
It makes you the type of person
who is going to save all our lives.

29:46.043 --> 29:47.138
Oh, okay.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.757
What is this place?

29:58.411 --> 29:59.477
I don't know.

30:00.615 --> 30:02.064
Looks like they left in a hurry.

30:02.389 --> 30:05.057
- She's not here. Let's...
- <i>Down here! This way!</i>

30:05.562 --> 30:07.790
Quiet! Go, go.

30:16.605 --> 30:19.566
All right, everybody, spread out.
They got to be in here somewhere.

30:39.215 --> 30:40.027
<i>Sir!</i>

30:41.664 --> 30:42.678
Found 'em.

30:43.195 --> 30:45.550
Good. Let's go. Let's move out, come on.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.967
Can we get out of here, please?

31:00.577 --> 31:02.441
- What is it?
- I have an idea.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.830
Come on.

31:09.059 --> 31:10.059
<i>Let's go.</i>

31:13.860 --> 31:14.981
Wait a minute.

31:16.069 --> 31:18.229
- What is this place?
- The mainland.

31:19.381 --> 31:21.270
- What are we doing here?
- I told you already.

31:21.350 --> 31:22.680
We need to get that plant.

31:24.349 --> 31:25.638
Something seems fishy.

31:30.765 --> 31:31.894
Never gets old.

31:38.121 --> 31:40.336
Sorry, buddy.
You're just going to slow me down.

31:53.705 --> 31:54.894
How's it coming, Rodney?

31:54.976 --> 31:56.835
I'm just about finished... I think.

31:58.792 --> 31:59.913
What was that?

32:00.072 --> 32:02.258
I will go see. Keep working.

32:23.503 --> 32:24.513
Don't move!

32:25.560 --> 32:26.571
Major Lorne.

32:27.132 --> 32:29.277
<i>- It's me, Teyla.</i>
- You shouldn't be out here.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.076
Major, it's me.

32:31.295 --> 32:33.161
Everyone's been ordered
back to the mess hall.

32:33.304 --> 32:34.452
But Dr. Mckay and I...

32:34.541 --> 32:37.187
Put your hands on your head. Slowly.

32:51.061 --> 32:52.086
Teyla?

33:02.486 --> 33:03.511
Oh, God...

33:36.438 --> 33:38.174
<i>All right, let's get her up.</i>

33:49.858 --> 33:50.951
Come on...

33:53.568 --> 33:54.624
All right.

33:55.003 --> 33:57.108
Look, I know you're probably
panicking right now,

33:57.190 --> 33:59.440
but there is no time for that.
You need to focus.

33:59.822 --> 34:02.601
I'm sure you're wondering,
who tied you to the desk...

34:11.701 --> 34:14.105
- You're awake.
- Major Lorne, you must set me free...

34:14.185 --> 34:17.306
Save it. You're not going anywhere
till I get some answers.

34:18.463 --> 34:20.952
I need to know
what you've done to my people.

34:21.032 --> 34:23.274
What I've done?
You believe I'm behind this?

34:23.356 --> 34:26.330
Is it a drug? Some kind of bio-weapon?

34:26.426 --> 34:29.310
Major, they're sick. You as well.

34:29.406 --> 34:31.935
<i>The entire base is infected
with a disease.</i>

34:32.583 --> 34:34.366
Everyone except you.

34:35.283 --> 34:37.534
Yes. I'm immune to its effects.

34:37.702 --> 34:38.911
Isn't that convenient?

34:39.288 --> 34:40.744
How many of those have you taken?

34:40.826 --> 34:42.902
Why don't you just let me
worry about that, okay?

34:42.985 --> 34:43.991
It's the pills.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.670
<i>They're what's making you act like this.</i>

34:46.927 --> 34:49.545
They're confusing you.
They're making you unstable.

34:49.658 --> 34:50.975
Making me unstable?

34:51.350 --> 34:54.795
I'm not the one who unleashed a disease
on my people, okay? Quit stalling.

34:54.877 --> 34:56.831
I want to know what you were doing
in the hall...

35:00.898 --> 35:01.923
Rodney!

35:02.214 --> 35:03.719
- Teyla?
- Yes.

35:04.150 --> 35:07.403
It's good to see you. Colonel Carter,
Dr. Zelenka, you as well.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.052
How did you find me?

35:10.239 --> 35:14.009
Well, we were having trouble finding you
by ourselves, so we followed him.

35:14.294 --> 35:15.540
Did you finish your work?

35:16.250 --> 35:17.429
What do you mean?

35:19.326 --> 35:20.745
Can you disarm the force shield?

35:24.068 --> 35:25.763
I don't know.

35:46.236 --> 35:47.261
Quickly!

36:06.584 --> 36:07.525
Don't move!

36:09.336 --> 36:10.361
Drop it.

36:12.029 --> 36:13.138
Now back away.

36:19.609 --> 36:20.627
Now...

36:21.304 --> 36:22.356
Tell me...

36:23.404 --> 36:24.838
Who the hell are you?

36:28.964 --> 36:30.848
I know you don't remember everything.

36:31.069 --> 36:32.595
You have no idea what's going on.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.373
You're confused,
maybe even a little scared.

36:35.537 --> 36:36.571
I know I would be.

36:37.669 --> 36:38.919
But you have to trust me.

36:41.130 --> 36:42.259
We're friends.

36:42.599 --> 36:45.367
The things we've been through together,
I don't care what anyone says,

36:45.463 --> 36:46.870
no disease can wipe that away.

36:47.401 --> 36:48.543
Not completely.

36:48.955 --> 36:51.498
Okay, deep down,
you know I'm telling the truth.

36:54.043 --> 36:55.938
- Now, give me the gun.
- Oh, nice try.

36:58.514 --> 37:00.383
For all I know,
you're the one who tied me up.

37:00.469 --> 37:01.476
Fine.

37:01.846 --> 37:05.103
Then shoot me, and you'll be all alone,
in the middle of a dark forest,

37:05.183 --> 37:08.739
with no idea who you are, where you're
going, or what you're going to do next.

37:09.172 --> 37:10.939
How could I possibly make it any worse?

37:12.465 --> 37:13.654
That's a good point.

37:24.934 --> 37:26.383
Here. Sit.

37:26.779 --> 37:28.469
Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?

37:28.549 --> 37:30.417
- I do not know how.
- And I do?

37:30.497 --> 37:33.114
Yes. You created the override program.

37:33.204 --> 37:36.809
- You said you were almost finished.
- Oh, then it should be easy.

37:37.137 --> 37:40.933
Rodney, listen to me.
You must do this, It is our only chance.

37:44.386 --> 37:46.044
The knowledge is inside you.

37:46.255 --> 37:47.706
You just have to find it.

38:09.808 --> 38:10.930
He did it.

38:11.024 --> 38:13.898
When I said I was almost finished,
I guess I wasn't kidding.

38:15.134 --> 38:16.226
Now what?

38:16.669 --> 38:20.182
Well, now we just have to hope
that colonel Sheppard and Ronon

38:20.427 --> 38:22.065
completed their side of the mission.

38:22.177 --> 38:23.811
Right. Right...

38:26.085 --> 38:27.110
- Who?
- Who?

38:29.852 --> 38:30.864
What is it?

38:31.110 --> 38:33.632
A ship.
Headed for the bay doors on the roof.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.568
Have they identified themselves?

38:35.648 --> 38:37.815
No, Sir. It could be help.

38:37.997 --> 38:39.912
It could also be some kind of an attack.

38:39.992 --> 38:43.093
Get in touch with the others.
Tell them to meet me at the Jumper bay.

38:43.206 --> 38:44.737
<i>And find major Lorne!</i>

38:51.153 --> 38:53.299
- Nice flying.
- Thanks.

38:53.614 --> 38:55.560
Come on, help me with this stuff.

38:57.399 --> 38:59.209
We got to get this to Teyla right away.

38:59.331 --> 39:00.337
Who?

39:00.723 --> 39:01.742
Come on.

39:04.499 --> 39:05.982
Hands in the air. Now.

39:06.697 --> 39:08.501
Listen, Lieutenant, this is medicine.

39:08.582 --> 39:10.855
- We need to deliver it.
- I said, hands in the air.

39:15.652 --> 39:16.964
Let's take them to the brig.

39:17.743 --> 39:19.000
You're making a mistake.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.054
There are sick people who need that.

39:21.765 --> 39:23.375
You sure you know what you're doing?

39:23.458 --> 39:25.317
What the hell is going on here?

39:25.453 --> 39:28.258
Sir, we caught these men
trying to infiltrate the base.

39:28.338 --> 39:29.879
Lorne, you have got to listen to me.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.043
Everybody on this base
is going to die if you don't.

39:32.123 --> 39:34.092
- And who are you?
- Look in your pocket.

39:34.393 --> 39:36.653
- What?
- Just look in your vest pocket.

39:41.309 --> 39:43.618
<i>You took a picture of him
just in case it came to this.</i>

39:43.728 --> 39:44.842
<i>I was there.</i>

39:47.009 --> 39:48.409
He's telling the truth.

39:49.469 --> 39:51.211
This is our commanding officer.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.080
That's right.

39:53.735 --> 39:55.496
I am your commanding officer.

39:55.665 --> 39:58.189
So... you should do what I say.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.842
Yes, Sir. What are your orders?

40:04.214 --> 40:05.966
- Do what he says.
- Gun.

40:07.327 --> 40:08.434
Follow me.

40:29.575 --> 40:30.906
Colonel, you're awake.

40:34.405 --> 40:35.527
What happened?

40:35.607 --> 40:38.139
Teyla distributed the plant
through the ventilation system.

40:38.245 --> 40:39.647
<i>Knocked you out for a bit.</i>

40:39.917 --> 40:41.482
How long have I been asleep?

40:41.734 --> 40:42.609
About a day.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.485
A day?

40:44.686 --> 40:46.679
Hit some people harder than others.

40:47.857 --> 40:49.699
How are you feeling, John?
How's your memory?

40:51.390 --> 40:53.677
Oh, pretty good, I think. I mean...

40:54.307 --> 40:55.946
things are a little fuzzy.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.214
If I forget your birthday next year...

40:59.038 --> 41:00.370
I will forgive you.

41:02.008 --> 41:03.899
When you are feeling well enough,

41:04.072 --> 41:07.136
major Lorne wishes to speak with you.
He feels badly about what happened.

41:07.773 --> 41:09.165
It wasn't his fault.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.804
Just glad he still had
the photo I gave him.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.007
- That was good thinking, by the way.
<i>- Yes.</i>

41:14.087 --> 41:16.440
If the distribution of the cure
had been delayed any longer,

41:16.560 --> 41:18.176
many more people would have died.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.030
What do you mean?

41:23.344 --> 41:24.470
Where's McKay?

41:44.654 --> 41:46.037
You should get some sleep.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.712
It's okay. I'm fine.

41:51.597 --> 41:53.569
I can let you know when she wakes up.

41:53.795 --> 41:54.922
I wanna stay.

41:56.053 --> 41:57.060
Okay.

41:58.675 --> 42:00.484
She's not giving up, you know.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.763
She's a fighter.

42:14.463 --> 42:15.365
Katie?

42:18.384 --> 42:19.408
Doctor!

42:20.106 --> 42:21.539
She's moving her fingers.

42:23.442 --> 42:24.585
Katie? Katie!

42:28.331 --> 42:29.338
Hello.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.265
Where am I?

42:31.570 --> 42:33.103
You're in the infirmary.

42:33.436 --> 42:34.472
You're safe.

42:35.517 --> 42:37.004
Do you remember anything?

42:49.747 --> 42:51.070
It's good to see you.

42:51.318 --> 42:53.765
Yeah, it's good to see you too.
