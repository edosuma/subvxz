WEBVTT

00:10.043 --> 00:13.079
Yeah, I had a great time
today, too, Charlotte

00:13.079 --> 00:14.214
Oh, nothing really.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.515
I'm having the folks
over for dinner.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.210
Just the family and Roz.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.053
Well, I've done it
a thousand times before.

00:20.053 --> 00:23.420
Okay, then,
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow
.

00:24.124 --> 00:24.419
Bye.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.130
For God's sake.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.431
This thing...

00:31.431 --> 00:33.422
breaks like crockwork.

00:34.134 --> 00:37.137
(laughs)

00:37.137 --> 00:38.138
Crockwork.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.439
I'll tell you.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.441
Frasier, once again,
you suffer the tragedy

00:41.441 --> 00:43.432
of being cleverandalone.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.054
Oh, for God's sake, Dad.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.355
Would you please
throw that thing away?

00:55.355 --> 00:56.356
Why? What for?

00:56.356 --> 00:58.058
When I get
through gluing it,

00:58.058 --> 00:59.359
it'll be as good as new.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.360
(doorbell ringing)

01:00.360 --> 01:02.362
It wasn't any good
when it was new.

01:02.362 --> 01:05.364
It's just an ugly,
worthless pot.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.067
Oh.
Hello.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.228
Hi. How was
the honeymoon?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.638
Oh, Tahiti
was absolute paradise,

01:11.638 --> 01:14.232
except for poor Niles
getting sunburned.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.278
Oh, dear, Niles.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.145
You look like you
crawled out of a bisque.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.484
And you look like someone
who doesn't want

01:24.484 --> 01:26.179
his Paul Gauguin
souvenir oven mitt.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.082
Niles, you remembered.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.256
Hey, guys.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.324
Welcome back.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.826
Hello, Martin.
Hey.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.327
You're a bit dressed up
for a family dinner.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.158
Oh, well,
Roz is dropping
by

01:36.463 --> 01:38.164
with someone she
wanted me to meet.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.825
Ooh, a lady friend?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.564
No, we're going
to form a jazz trio, Niles.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.303
Of course it's
a lady friend,

01:44.504 --> 01:47.240
you cherry-faced fool.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.442
So you want us
to clear out?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.211
No, no, no,
you don't have to do t
hat.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.513
Actually, if I don't like her,
Roz will just take her away.

01:53.513 --> 01:58.518
We've agreed upon
a safety word--Enchant
?
..

01:58.518 --> 02:00.509
If circumstances should dictate,
all I have to do is say it

02:01.221 --> 02:02.518
and Roz will know
that I'm not interested.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.124
(doorbell ringing)

02:04.124 --> 02:05.148
Niles, would you
mind getting that?

02:05.358 --> 02:06.459
That's probably Roz.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.161
I'm just going
to get rid

02:08.161 --> 02:09.458
of Dad's arts and crafts project here, all right?

02:11.464 --> 02:12.465
Hi, Roz.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.200
Hey, you guys are back.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.468
Hey, Martin.
Hi, Roz.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.163
This is my
friend Lizbeth.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.164
How are ya?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.173
Good, good. That's
all right. Yes.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.474
This is Daphne
and Martin and...

02:21.474 --> 02:22.809
Hi.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.276
Can I get you a glass of wine?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.204
Oh, please. Frasier has
the greatest wine.

02:27.714 --> 02:28.715
Oh, sounds
good to me.

02:28.715 --> 02:31.284
Life's too short
to drink bad wine, right?

02:31.284 --> 02:32.842
Amen to that.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.722
Just a half a glass
with club soda.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.316
You know how
I love my spritzer.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.321
Frasier.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.219
What? Oh, hi.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.700
Roz, what a
pleasant surprise.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.302
This is Lizbeth.
We were just shopping

02:49.302 --> 02:51.304
.
in the neighborhood
and thought we'd stop by

02:51.304 --> 02:53.840
How lovely. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Elizabeth.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.676
It's not Elizabeth.
It's Lizbeth.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.378
Ah. Like "Lisbon. "

02:58.378 --> 03:00.246
Like a what?

03:00.246 --> 03:01.838
Enchant?.

03:04.651 --> 03:05.652
Right,

03:05.652 --> 03:08.519
and meeting you
is just...super.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.825
Yes, the feeling
is mutual.

03:12.825 --> 03:16.329
Enchant?. Enchant?. Enchant?.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.821
Oh, and for me, it's
just been super. Super, super.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.502
I took a shot.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.204
Yes.
Yeah. Okay.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.205
Well, I guess
we can stop

03:25.205 --> 03:26.206
shaking hands now.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.507
Oh, well, I'm ready
whenever you are.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.496
Well, then just let go.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.870
I did. You're
holding on to me.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.413
Oh, dear.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.711
?
.
Dad, what kind of glue
were you using on that pot

03:37.717 --> 03:39.412
Super.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.422
How could you be so stupid
to glue us together?

03:42.422 --> 03:45.258
I thought you said he was smart.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.360
Don't panic. I
-I seem to recall

03:47.360 --> 03:50.363
that Super Glue can be
dissolved with acetone.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.398
You know, nail
polish remover.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.456
He's the smart one.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.535
How did you know that?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.303
I knew that
from, from school.

03:57.303 --> 03:57.860
School lunches!

03:58.304 --> 03:59.706
The Kriezel brothers
used to glue

03:59.706 --> 04:01.874
a cafeteria tray to his tie.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.808
DAPHNE:
Well, I suppose
we better get some.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.278
Let's go
to the drugstore.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.575
Drugstore. Oh. I gotta go.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.282
No, they'll be
back in ten minutes.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.583
No, no, no, I-I gottago.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.285
I started
the new juice diet

04:12.285 --> 04:13.586
and I got 64 ounces

04:13.586 --> 04:16.289
of cran-raspberry
looking for a new home.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.290
.
Oh, for God's sake

04:17.290 --> 04:18.279
I'll tell you what.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.591
Just, uh... Here.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.293
Just, just come
right in here.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.295
There we are.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.388
Yes, uh, all right,
just a moment. Uh...

04:25.832 --> 04:28.323
Are you there?

04:28.835 --> 04:29.324
Almost.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.739
That's close enough!

04:36.009 --> 04:38.344
Could you maybe
put on some music?

04:38.344 --> 04:40.778
Dad, could you
put on some music, please?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.016
Yeah. Sure. What do
you want? Pop? Big band?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.007
Oh, for God's sakes,
just turn the damn thing on!

04:50.456 --> 04:51.457
Sorry I'm late.
Mm-hmm.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.948
The Cinco de Mayo traffic
wasmuy malo.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.995
Oh, yes, that's right.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.986
They closed some streets
for the fireworks display.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.726
Well, happy birthday, Roz.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.898
Yeah, happy birthday.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.702
Whatever.

05:02.702 --> 05:06.706
Used to be I'd go out and get
a little wild on my birthday.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.402
Now I go out
and get a little dinner.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.698
There's nothing wrong
with dinner.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.080
I know, but
it used to come with sex.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.581
Come on, Roz.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.583
Sounds like you need a drink.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.986
Oh, that used
to come with sex, too.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.923
Sounds like we've got
another passenger

05:23.923 --> 05:25.425
on the SSAin't Gettin' Any.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.414
(doorbell ringing)

05:27.927 --> 05:29.429
Hello.
Hi, Niles.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.431
Wonderful day, marvelous day.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.432
You two look grand.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.525
Where's Daphne?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.693
Who shoved a bluebird in you?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.063
You know the SS Ain't
Gettin' Any?Man overboard.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.444
You and Daphne?

05:44.444 --> 05:49.541
Last night, Daphne and I engaged
in sweet carnal delights.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.685
Did you say
"carnal" or "caramel"?

05:54.921 --> 05:58.491
I gotta go wrapt.
Roz's birthday gift

05:58.491 --> 06:01.794
Oh! I forgot
about Roz's birthday.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.785
You don't have anything
I could give her, do you?

06:04.430 --> 06:04.797
Well, let's look.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.499
Maybe one of
these books. Just...

06:06.499 --> 06:07.800
For God's sake, Niles.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.802
I mean... How could you
forget her birthday?

06:09.802 --> 06:11.504
It's the whole reason
we're having dinner.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.802
Oh, forgive me. I've been
a little distracted lately.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.509
Especially last night.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.510
And again this morning.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.499
Niles. Oh...

06:18.811 --> 06:19.709
Oh, dear God.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.614
If Daphne knew I was
speaking so indiscreetly,

06:21.614 --> 06:22.603
she'd be mortified.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.474
And just when I thought
I'd worn him out,

06:24.984 --> 06:26.486
he flips me over
like a griddle cake

06:26.486 --> 06:28.488
and off we go again.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.479
Niles?

06:30.790 --> 06:31.848
.
I couldn't catch me breath

06:32.592 --> 06:33.860
It was like a marathon.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.762
I tell you, he spoilt
me for any other man.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.965
Frasier's brother Niles?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.067
And guess how he woke
me up this morning.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.902
Oh, shut up already.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.504
Okay, birthday girl.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.639
Come on over here
and open some gifts.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.508
Hello.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.066
Hello, yourself.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.414
All right, you two,
let's pay attention.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.715
.
This is Roz's birthday

06:55.715 --> 06:57.583
This gift is from Niles.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.574
Happy birthday, Roz.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.757
It's a crock.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.463
With a chipped lid...

07:10.463 --> 07:11.452
and a dead bee.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.765
Thank you, Niles.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.756
Glad you like it.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.771
Oh, you know, I-I think I left
your present in my room.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.673
Niles, will you help me with it?

07:20.673 --> 07:21.901
Oh, of course.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.609
We'll be back very quickie.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.844
Quickly.

07:24.844 --> 07:25.708
Quickly.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.615
You don't think
they're gonna...?

07:29.615 --> 07:32.218
Oh, I have no idea.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.487
Try not to
think about it.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.479
(fireworks exploding)

07:42.061 --> 07:44.664
Wow. He really is good.

07:44.664 --> 07:48.998
(explosions continue)

07:49.635 --> 07:51.933
(firecrackers going off)

07:55.641 --> 07:56.509
Dad,

07:56.509 --> 07:58.238
I bought you these headphones

07:58.744 --> 08:02.248
so that I wouldn't be subject
to your sports drivel.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.649
Please put them on.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.151
All right, I will.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.551
But only if you say it.

08:11.491 --> 08:17.497
I want you...
to wear those headphones.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.498
I don't know why you care.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.932
You're just gonna
be out riding on that

08:19.932 --> 08:21.934
stupid parade float.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.770
The KACL Fourth of July
float is not stupid.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.228
Unless you think it is stupid
to commemorate a hardy band

08:28.674 --> 08:30.076
of revolutionaries,
their minds ablaze...

08:30.076 --> 08:31.544
Hey, you're right!

08:31.544 --> 08:33.705
This does cut out
all the drivel.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.950
Oh, hi, Daph.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.951
My God, you
look hideous.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.653
Thank you.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.953
I wouldn't normally
wear polyester

08:41.953 --> 08:43.523
on the hottest
day of the year,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.091
but some English friends of mine

08:45.091 --> 08:46.592
are having
an Ugly American party

08:46.592 --> 08:47.760
in honor of the Fourth.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.529
(doorbell ringing)

08:49.529 --> 08:51.831
(speaking in American accent) :
We're going to toss back

08:51.831 --> 08:53.833
a couple of cold brewskis,
watch the ball game

08:53.833 --> 08:56.536
and not use
the metric system.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
Oh, hello, Niles.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.538
Oh, hello, Uncle Sam.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.839
Didn't you just hand me

08:59.839 --> 09:00.840
a flyer for
a mattress sale?

09:00.840 --> 09:02.842
Uh, listen, Roz is
running a little late,

09:02.842 --> 09:05.538
so we're just gonna meet
her downstairs, all right?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.647
Dad!

09:07.647 --> 09:09.205
We're off!
See you later.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.716
Oh, okay. Good luck.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.718
Boy, these are great.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.721
Now I can watch TV
without bugging anybody.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.225
??
..
?? My bacon
is Farmer Frank's bacon

09:19.225 --> 09:24.026
?? There's no mistakin'?
?the quality...??

09:24.730 --> 09:26.766
Wait a minute.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.334
Is my bunting adroop?
It's supposed

09:28.334 --> 09:29.824
.
to drape evenly.
Oh, for God's sake

09:30.269 --> 09:31.837
You're not going to send me back

09:31.837 --> 09:33.339
to the Space Needle
with binoculars

09:33.339 --> 09:34.840
and a walkie-talkie
again, are you?

09:34.840 --> 09:36.342
No, there's
no time for that.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.833
We can fix it on the fly.
It'll just take a second.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.337
Niles, you grab that end.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.853
Excuse me.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.356
This shouldn't come off
like this, should it?

09:50.356 --> 09:53.348
Oh, dear.
Um, here.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.225
Oh, Lord.

09:56.629 --> 09:57.697
Oh, Dad!

09:57.697 --> 09:58.698
Hey, Dad.
Dad!

09:58.698 --> 09:59.699
Mr. Crane.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.700
Dad!

10:00.700 --> 10:01.701
Dad!

10:01.701 --> 10:02.702
Mr. Crane.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.033
Dad! Dad! Dad!

10:04.604 --> 10:05.605
He can't hear us.
We're stuck out here.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.106
What are we going to do?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.108
Let's not panic.
Maybe some of our neighbors

10:09.108 --> 10:10.097
are on their balconies.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.777
Hello!
Hello!

10:11.777 --> 10:13.369
Yeah. Mr. Winston,
are you home?

10:13.613 --> 10:17.316
Hello? Hello?!

10:17.316 --> 10:18.408
(jets flying by)

10:18.818 --> 10:21.412
The Blue Angels!

10:24.190 --> 10:25.680
Wow.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.762
What?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.957
Locked out!

10:32.765 --> 10:34.062
Dad!
Dad!
Martin!

10:34.767 --> 10:36.758
Mr. Crane!
Martin!
Dad!

10:37.069 --> 10:38.004
Oh...

10:38.004 --> 10:39.096
(sighs)

10:39.772 --> 10:42.675
Roz, how long does
a baseball match last?

10:42.675 --> 10:43.643
Well, usually three hours.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.746
Oh, dear.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.306
This sucks. I don't
even have my cell phone.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.250
Don't you have you
r cell phone, Frasier?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.318
Roz, I'm Uncle Sam.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.853
I don't have a cell phone.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.222
I shouldn't even
have this zipper.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.091
It's going to be
a hundred degrees out here.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.786
I'm roasting in these things.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.791
That's it. These
clothes are coming off.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.972
(phone ringing)

11:12.972 --> 11:14.974
That's all right, Niles.
Allow me.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.373
Daphne.

11:16.742 --> 11:17.810
Coming.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.111
(phone ringing)

11:19.111 --> 11:22.114
Hello. Crane residence.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.684
Oh, hello, Mum.
Happy Thanksgiving.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.087
It's the holiday where
everyone eats turkey.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.790
No, we're having goose.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.091
Daphne, when you're finished with that,

11:32.091 --> 11:34.927
could you please bring us some
snacks to soak up this wine?

11:34.927 --> 11:36.996
Yes, and a little
more wine.

11:36.996 --> 11:40.397
Who knew my sorrows
would be such strong swimmers?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.268
I can't talk right now, Mum.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.769
Dr. Crane has guests.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.134
Yeah, he's still out of work.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.808
Of course I'm worried
he might let me go.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.810
I worry about it every day.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.107
But I'm coping.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.980
Alice is so cute.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.284
She fell asleep
hugging her bottle.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.352
I'm right behind her.

12:00.352 --> 12:04.857
Niles, would you please stop
being so morose?

12:04.857 --> 12:07.359
It is Thanksgiving.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.861
Oh, you're right.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.830
I should count
my blessings.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.467
I'm in the midst
of a bitter divorce.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.469
Maris is freezing my assets,

12:16.469 --> 12:17.970
forcing me to live
in the Shangri-la

12:17.970 --> 12:19.972
which is the devil's
own apartment complex

12:19.972 --> 12:22.975
where last night,
they turned off my heat,

12:22.975 --> 12:24.465
re-freezing my assets.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.480
We're all going through
a bit of a rough patch.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.845
Look at Roz and me.
We're out of a job.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.816
Oh, not me.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.818
I just took a phone temp job
in customer service.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.120
I can work from wherever I am.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.815
They just patch
the calls through.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.491
Well, now, you see.
There's a positive attitude.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.494
Some people see losing a job
as an opportunity.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.995
Oh, thank you, Daphne.

12:42.995 --> 12:46.362
(phone ringing)

12:46.866 --> 12:48.934
Hello.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.936
(sexy voice) :
Oh, hello.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.133
Yes, this is Monique.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.177
I'm just lying in the tub,
soaping myself all over...

13:00.846 --> 13:02.181
FRASIER:
Good heavens, Roz!

13:02.181 --> 13:05.184
Is that the sort
of customer you're servicing?

13:05.184 --> 13:06.452
Hang that up!

13:06.452 --> 13:09.054
Call me later, tiger, okay?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.556
What? It pays the bills.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.046
And I'm not tied to a desk.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.927
Not unless they ask you to be.

13:14.927 --> 13:18.898
Good news.
The Cowboys just scored.

13:18.898 --> 13:24.403
.
Bad news is, I kind
of screamed and wokesomebody's baby up

13:24.403 --> 13:25.267
Oh, Daphne,

13:25.838 --> 13:26.896
my bath salts man

13:26.972 --> 13:28.574
has just delivered
a new shipment

13:28.574 --> 13:30.064
of my proprietary blend.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.511
Could you please
run me a tub tonight?

13:32.511 --> 13:36.482
Of course I will, Dr. Crane.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.040
What would you do without me?

13:39.518 --> 13:41.020
A little more?

13:41.020 --> 13:44.089
I know things have
been tough lately.

13:44.089 --> 13:45.591
But they'll turn around for you.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.081
Just watch.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.097
She's an angel.

13:52.097 --> 13:54.088
You're right,
Frasier--

13:54.600 --> 13:55.601
I'm being too morose.

13:55.601 --> 13:56.602
Not taking action.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.502
I'm telling Daphne
I love her tonight.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.005
Niles, let's
not be rash.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.007
Come on, let's get you
some fresh air.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.998
I don't want air.
I want Daphne!

14:10.049 --> 14:12.643
(phone ringing)

14:19.625 --> 14:21.616
Hello.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.634
Well, thank you.

14:28.634 --> 14:33.138
You've got a nice
deep voice, too.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.406
Oh, I don't know...

14:34.406 --> 14:38.978
Uh, brown pants
and a plaid shirt.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.970
Hello? Hello?

14:47.987 --> 14:48.988
Is everything
all right?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.923
What's wrong with Niles?

14:50.923 --> 14:52.324
MARTIN:
He decided that
today's the day

14:52.324 --> 14:54.026
he's going
to tell Daphne.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.017
He's going to tell Daphne
with all of us here?

14:56.328 --> 14:58.564
That's gonna be
uncomfortable.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.327
I know, but I guess
he figures he just can't
afford to wait any longer.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.269
All right, Niles...

15:03.269 --> 15:04.904
Niles, Niles, please.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.272
NILES:
Daphne...

15:06.272 --> 15:07.973
Dr. Crane, I know what
you're going to do.

15:07.973 --> 15:08.974
You do?

15:08.974 --> 15:10.276
Not you, Dr. Crane--
Dr. Crane.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.277
And you can't fire me
because I quit.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.278
What?!

15:12.278 --> 15:14.980
After all I've done
to save you money.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.982
I'm washing my face
with dish soap

15:16.982 --> 15:18.973
while you're out buying
imported bath salts

15:19.285 --> 15:20.286
Iike a big rich girl.

15:20.286 --> 15:24.347
I hope you rot
in debtor's prison!

15:25.624 --> 15:27.615
She's an angel.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.092
I'll pick you up
at 7:00, my angel.

15:38.938 --> 15:45.010
You'd better get used
to the name Evelyn Griebel,

15:45.010 --> 15:47.706
because you're going
to be hearing an awful lot

15:48.113 --> 15:49.478
of it around here.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.484
Evelyn Griebel.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.287
Sounds like music, doesn't it?

15:55.287 --> 15:57.022
Haven't you only been
dating her a week?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.011
Well, yes,

15:58.357 --> 16:01.026
and you know how loath I am
to use the expression,

16:01.026 --> 16:02.027
"She may be the one, "

16:02.027 --> 16:04.222
but I think in this case
it's appropriate.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.033
I finally got Maris calmed down.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.134
I hope you're happy.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.694
All I said was,
"Maris, why the long face?"

16:12.171 --> 16:14.173
Yes, and now she's on
the phone

16:14.173 --> 16:16.175
to her chin grinder
in Zurich.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.166
(doorbell ringing)

16:18.677 --> 16:20.179
I'll get that.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.168
It's probably Roz.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.683
Well?

16:24.683 --> 16:26.185
Sorry I'm late,
but I had a date.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.187
Yes. I thought
that was last night.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.456
It was a good date.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.157
How's your new girlfriend?

16:32.157 --> 16:35.194
I allowed her to climb
to the first base camp

16:35.194 --> 16:37.196
on Mt. Crane, and I believe

16:37.196 --> 16:42.034
she's feeling the effects
of the altitude.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.436
Is one of them nausea?
I'm getting that now.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.304
Oh, shut up.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.772
You hungry, Roz?

16:46.772 --> 16:48.273
There's cheese here.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.342
Oh, nobody opened it.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.379
Dear God, Dad, that's
three years old.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.368
Throw it out.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.781
No, it'll be fine.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.783
You sure you don't want any?

16:57.783 --> 17:00.149
"
The label says
it's "famously spreadable.

17:00.552 --> 17:04.123
Funny, Roz, doesn't your
label say the same thing?

17:04.123 --> 17:06.625
What does yours say, Niles?

17:06.625 --> 17:08.183
"May cause drowsiness"?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.195
I'm just having some fun.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.499
'Cause I know I'll be
settling down soon.

17:13.499 --> 17:19.070
Yes, well, thank God
my dating days are over.

17:19.070 --> 17:22.141
Three years on the Seattle
singles scene

17:22.141 --> 17:23.631
is quite enough, thank you.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.047
(phone ringing)

17:28.047 --> 17:29.537
Hello.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.517
Oh, hi, Evelyn.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.382
She can't go five minutes
without talking to me.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.689
Listen, I'm really looking
forward to dinner tomorrow.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.191
I see.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.692
Well, if tomorrow's no good...

17:40.692 --> 17:42.125
I see.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.431
But you said you were having
such a lovely time.

17:45.431 --> 17:46.693
I see.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.135
Perhaps I'd better
take this in my room.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.229
Oh, what are you smirking at?!

18:00.512 --> 18:03.782
What are you staring at?

18:03.782 --> 18:06.485
It's 14.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.253
What?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.550
You're reading about
Jack Russell terriers, right?

18:10.155 --> 18:11.757
That's how man
y years they live.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.816
14.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.389
(doorbell ringing)

18:22.634 --> 18:23.702
Oh, hello, Niles.

18:23.702 --> 18:28.264
There are the merry bachelors
in their swinging new pad.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.131
Where's Maris?

18:31.443 --> 18:33.445
She's take
n to her bed.

18:33.445 --> 18:37.438
This large earring fad
has compressed her spine.

18:37.749 --> 18:42.209
Where is your, uh, enchanting
new home healthcare worker?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.656
I just found out what
that second toilet

18:44.656 --> 18:46.146
in me loo is for.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.250
Talk about a shock.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.495
Hello there.

18:49.495 --> 18:50.762
Hello.
You're, uh...

18:50.762 --> 18:53.322
Oh, don't tell me.
I'm good with names.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.666
Uh... Miles Crane.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.497
Yes, I am.

18:56.768 --> 18:57.700
.
And, and, you're..

18:58.137 --> 19:00.506
Daphne Moon from
Manchester,

19:00.506 --> 19:01.507
where you developed
a liking

19:01.507 --> 19:03.308
for Knickerson's
Lemon Biscuits.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.345
What a kind man you are,
Miles Crane.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.245
FRASIER:
Oh, by the way,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.215
I've invited
Roz Doyle to join us.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.518
She's my producer
over at the radio station.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.219
She had no plans this evening.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.516
You know, I think
the poor thing

19:16.221 --> 19:17.210
has a hard time
meeting men.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.525
Anyway...

19:19.525 --> 19:20.526
Would you care for
a scotch, Niles?

19:20.526 --> 19:21.515
Yes... Actually...

19:21.960 --> 19:24.163
No, I'm in
a sherry mood tonight.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.222
Sherry?

19:27.299 --> 19:30.836
What an intriguing idea.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.339
I think I can scare up
a bottle of sherry.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.207
(doorbell ringing)

19:35.207 --> 19:36.208
DAPHNE:
Oh, I'll get it.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.344
FRASIER:
Oh, hi, Roz.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.712
Come on in.
I'd like you to meet my dad.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.714
This is
Martin Crane

19:42.714 --> 19:45.350
and his home healthcare worker Daphne Moon,

19:45.350 --> 19:48.220
and, of course, this is
my brother-- Niles Crane.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.221
Oh, God, is it Niles?

19:49.221 --> 19:50.722
I feel so embarrassed.

19:50.722 --> 19:51.711
Oh, no, please
don't be.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.723
Actually, I prefer Miles.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.074

20:03.368 --> 20:04.369
(doorbell ringing)

20:04.369 --> 20:05.358
Oh, that'll be
my pizza.

20:05.637 --> 20:06.638
Would you get it?

20:06.638 --> 20:08.373
What?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.374
You are not having pizza.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.343
I made a duck.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.377
What, you're going to tell m
e what I can eat now?

20:12.377 --> 20:14.413
No, I'm just saying
that it's rude

20:14.413 --> 20:16.415
to bring your own food
to a dinner party.

20:16.415 --> 20:17.916
Hi.

20:17.916 --> 20:18.917
Hello.

20:18.917 --> 20:19.918
1 2 bucks.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.408
Right.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.423
Hey, aren't you that
new radio shrink at KACL,

20:24.423 --> 20:25.924
Dr. Frasier Crane,
right?

20:25.924 --> 20:26.925
Yes, I am.

20:26.925 --> 20:27.926
It's always nice to meet a fan.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.428
Actually, I'm in
the radio game myself.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.929
This pizza thing
is just paying the bills

20:30.929 --> 20:32.431
until a job opens up.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.921
Maybe you could put
a good word in for me down...

20:36.935 --> 20:37.799
The pizza smells good.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.371
Have some.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.269
It's called
"The Dirty Dozen. "

20:40.405 --> 20:44.610
1 2 delicious toppings,
and not one of them duck.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.345
This from the gourmet

20:46.345 --> 20:48.280
who dumped my Cornish Yarg
cheese down the disposal.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.008
It was covered with moId.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.380
It was supposed to be!

20:50.749 --> 20:52.784
Well, I said I'd replace it, didn't I?

20:52.784 --> 20:55.776
Here it is.
Hope you're happy.

20:58.290 --> 21:05.355
With "pasteurized, processed
cheese-flavored snack food. "

21:07.766 --> 21:09.734
Dear God.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.938
Looks like someone
melted down a highway cone.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.929
I was just trying
to be nice.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.942
You don't need to
be a jerk about it.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
You're right, Dad.
I'm sorry.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.808
Thank you.

21:20.078 --> 21:22.046
Would you please
join me in the kitchen--

21:22.347 --> 21:24.372
Miles!

21:30.389 --> 21:32.391
He is driving me batty.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.484
All right, we
are making a deal.

21:34.693 --> 21:35.727
He spends six months here

21:35.727 --> 21:37.429
and then he's moving into your house.

21:37.429 --> 21:40.489
Absolutely.
We'll switch off.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.334
MARTIN:
Someone bring
me a beer?

21:42.334 --> 21:43.969
ROZ:
Yeah, beer
sound good.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.767
I should have just
gotten a keg.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.007
I'll tell you something-
- this is the last time

21:49.007 --> 21:51.066
I try to make a nice dinner
for these people.

22:00.552 --> 22:02.042
(doorbell ringing)

22:10.729 --> 22:11.430
Oh, hey, Dad.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.419
Hey.

22:12.731 --> 22:13.732
.
Dinner's ready

22:13.732 --> 22:14.596
All right.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.371
Hello, you guys.
Come on in.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.360
Dinner is served.

22:20.872 --> 22:21.861
Hello, Martin.
