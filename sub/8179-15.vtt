HEY.
HEY, BABE.

00:39.688 --> 00:42.123
UGH. I GOTTA LEARN TO PUT
A FEW MORE MINUTES

00:42.191 --> 00:44.959
BETWEEN TOOTHBRUSHING
AND ORANGE JUICE.

00:45.027 --> 00:48.062
NOW, DON'T FORGET, WE HAVE THAT
SHOW AT THE ART GALLERY TONIGHT.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.497
OH, GOD.

00:49.564 --> 00:51.065
COME ON, YOU CAN KEEP
YOURSELF BUSY

00:51.217 --> 00:52.850
BY LOOKING FOR PAINTINGS
WITH BOOBIES.

00:52.918 --> 00:55.002
OH, YEAH, LIKE BOOBIES IN
PAINTINGS ARE A REAL TURN-ON.

00:55.070 --> 00:58.005
THEY GOT LIKE ONE BOOBIE HERE, A
BOOBIE ON HER HEAD... IT'S CRAZY.

00:58.073 --> 00:59.607
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
HERE'S THE ADDRESS,

00:59.675 --> 01:02.043
GO STRAIGHT FROM WORK,
THE GALLERY'S IN SOHO.

01:02.110 --> 01:04.444
IT'S IN AN OLD
MEAT-PACKING WAREHOUSE.

01:04.513 --> 01:07.983
OK, SO THEY TOOK OUT BEEF
AND MOVED IN ART.

01:09.318 --> 01:11.386
I HAVE NOTHING MORE
TO SAY TO YOU.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.685
GOD, THIS IS BRUTAL.

01:27.753 --> 01:29.504
I CAN'T BELIEVE CARRIE'S
MAKING ME DO THIS.

01:29.572 --> 01:31.288
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING
WITH ME, MAN.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.708
<i>THANKS FOR RESCUING ME FROM
KELLY'S AMERICAN IDOL PARTY.</i>

01:33.776 --> 01:36.711
MAN, DENISE
WOULD'VE LOVED THIS.

01:36.779 --> 01:40.147
THIS IS THE FIRST GALLERY
OPENING I'VE BEEN TO SINCE...

01:40.215 --> 01:41.482
SINCE SHE DUMPED YOU?

01:41.550 --> 01:43.384
SHE DIDN'T DUMP ME, OK?

01:43.452 --> 01:46.755
WE PARTED AT HER REQUEST.

01:46.822 --> 01:49.890
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHILL
OUT AND GET SOME WINE?

01:51.427 --> 01:53.194
WHERE THE HELL
IS CARRIE?

01:53.262 --> 01:55.430
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:55.497 --> 01:58.032
NOTHING. I JUST GOT
A LITTLE MUSEUM HEAD.

02:00.135 --> 02:02.120
OH, UH, GO AHEAD,
TAKE IT.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.321
NO, NO. GO AHEAD.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.723
I HEARD IT'S A ZINFANDEL,
SO NO BIG LOSS.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.226
WELL, ACCORDING TO
MY WINE ENTHUSIASTS' CLUB,

02:08.294 --> 02:09.994
ZINFANDEL
IS THE NEW MERLOT.

02:10.062 --> 02:10.828
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

02:10.895 --> 02:13.281
WHAT'S NEXT? WE START
CHILLING CHIANTIS?

02:16.869 --> 02:18.637
OH, MY GOD, NO.

02:18.704 --> 02:19.871
WHAT?

02:19.938 --> 02:21.222
SEE THAT GIRL
OVER THERE?

02:21.290 --> 02:23.391
THAT'S
TRISH FLINTOFF.

02:23.459 --> 02:24.658
I DATED HER, LIKE,
10 YEARS AGO.

02:24.726 --> 02:25.994
YEAH, AND WHAT HAPPENED?

02:26.061 --> 02:28.829
OH, THE WAY I ENDED THINGS, I WAS-

02:28.898 --> 02:32.000
WHAT YOU CALL IN THE BUSINESS
- A "JACKASS."

02:32.067 --> 02:33.784
YOU KNOW WHAT?
PULL IN HERE, MAN.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.836
GUY, TAKE IT EASY, MAN. YOU'VE
BEEN MARRIED FOR, LIKE, 8 YEARS.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.838
I KNOW, YOU KNOW, BUT I
CANNOT BE SEEN BY HER, OK?

02:37.907 --> 02:41.509
SHE'S ON MY "TOP 3 MOST MOST
AWKWARD PEOPLE TO RUN INTO" LIST.

02:41.576 --> 02:44.678
RIGHT AFTER THIS FRIEND OF MY
DAD'S, WHO TAUGHT ME TO WRESTLE.

02:49.218 --> 02:50.918
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUYS.

02:50.986 --> 02:52.920
I JUST GOT ASKED OUT
ON A DATE.

02:52.988 --> 02:54.789
GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.
WHERE IS SHE?

02:54.856 --> 02:56.791
UH, IT'S THAT GUY OVER THERE.
BY THE WAY,

02:56.858 --> 03:01.729
IF YOU LIKE SHEEP'S MILK,
DO NOT MISS THE CHEESE TABLE.

03:02.781 --> 03:05.450
OK, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK,
ALL RIGHT?

03:05.517 --> 03:06.784
AFTER THIS WHOLE THING
WITH DENISE,

03:06.852 --> 03:09.286
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE
WHO'S INTO ME AGAIN.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.888
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

03:10.956 --> 03:12.623
WELL, I COULD THINK
OF 2 THINGS,

03:12.691 --> 03:14.658
AND THEY RHYME
WITH SCHMESTICLES.

03:16.812 --> 03:19.947
CALM DOWN.
IT'S JUST DINNER AND A MOVIE.

03:20.015 --> 03:21.282
WAIT. YOU SAID YES?

03:21.350 --> 03:23.885
YEAH. HE'S A NICE GUY.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.654
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,
AND I GOTTA EAT.

03:28.223 --> 03:30.808
WHAT'S YOUR
END GAME HERE?

03:30.876 --> 03:33.828
WE GO OUT, HE MAKES ME
FEEL DESIRABLE AGAIN,

03:33.896 --> 03:35.430
AND THEN WHEN HE
MAKES HIS MOVE, I GO,

03:35.498 --> 03:38.666
"OOH, SORRY, BUDDY.
I'M SWEET ON LADYKIND...

03:38.734 --> 03:40.635
BUT I'M VERY TOUCHED."

03:40.703 --> 03:42.270
I'M SURE
YOU WILL BE.

03:42.338 --> 03:45.339
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
TELL YOU GUYS ANYTHING.

03:45.407 --> 03:47.942
OH, GOOD. THERE'S CARRIE. LET'S GO.

03:48.010 --> 03:48.793
OK.

03:50.412 --> 03:53.848
OH, CARRIE, TOO CLOSE
TO SHE WHO HATES ME.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.184
MY GOD, THEY TOUCHED!

03:56.251 --> 03:58.286
THEY TOUCHED!
THEY'RE TALKING!

03:58.354 --> 03:59.954
DO SOMETHING.
CREATE A DISTRACTION.

04:00.021 --> 04:01.288
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

04:01.357 --> 04:02.957
I DON'T KNOW.
MOONWALK.

04:04.593 --> 04:07.061
OH, SHE LIKES HER PURSE.
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

04:07.129 --> 04:09.096
WOW, THEY'RE REALLY
HITTING IT OFF.

04:09.164 --> 04:10.615
STOP IT.
STOP TALKING.

04:10.683 --> 04:12.450
STOP TALKING.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.752
OH, NO.
THEY'RE COMING OVER HERE.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.288
HELL. I'M IN HELL.

04:17.623 --> 04:19.440
HONEY, HI.

04:19.507 --> 04:22.643
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEBODY.
TRISH, THIS IS MY HUSBAND DOUG.

04:22.712 --> 04:23.845
DOUG, THIS IS TRISH.

04:25.881 --> 04:27.164
HI, DOUG.

04:28.383 --> 04:30.318
I OWE YOU A PHONE CALL.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.907
I'M JUST SAYING, DO YOU
HAVE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HER?

04:35.975 --> 04:37.592
DOUG, YOU WENT OUT WITH HER
10 YEARS AGO

04:37.660 --> 04:39.728
AND WE HIT IT OFF
AND SHE WORKS FOR SAKS

04:39.795 --> 04:42.563
AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE ME TO THE
FRIENDS AND FAMILY SALE NEXT WEEK.

04:42.631 --> 04:44.365
LOOK, I AM BEGGING YOU
TO LET THIS GO.

04:44.433 --> 04:45.750
DOUG, COULD YOU JUST
EXPLAIN TO ME

04:45.818 --> 04:47.485
WHAT HAPPENED THAT
WAS SO TERRIBLE

04:47.553 --> 04:49.219
THAT I CAN'T EVEN HAVE
A MEAL WITH HER?

04:49.287 --> 04:52.740
I- I'LL TELL YOU, BUT I
JUST WANT YOU TO REMEMBER

04:52.808 --> 04:54.308
I'M STILL THE SAME OL' DOUG
WHO CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH

04:54.376 --> 04:56.143
WITH ONLY HIS BELLY BUTTON.

04:56.211 --> 04:58.012
WOULD YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.248
WELL, WE WENT OUT
A COUPLE TIMES

05:00.316 --> 05:03.984
AND I REALIZED IT WASN'T
GOING ANYWHERE LONG-TERM,

05:04.052 --> 05:07.738
<i>SO I MAY HAVE BOUGHT
CONCERT TICKETS</i>

05:07.806 --> 05:09.406
FOR A TOUR THAT WAS
6 MONTHS IN THE FUTURE

05:09.475 --> 05:10.942
TO MAKE HER THINK
I WAS SERIOUS

05:11.009 --> 05:14.211
SO THAT SHE WOULD SLEEP
WITH ME.

05:14.279 --> 05:16.897
THAT'S REALLY JERKY,
BUT-

05:16.965 --> 05:17.882
THERE'S MORE.

05:19.701 --> 05:21.635
AH, AFTER WE
FINALLY HOOKED UP,

05:21.703 --> 05:24.205
<i>I MAY HAVE CLIMBED OUT
OF HER BEDROOM WINDOW</i>

05:24.273 --> 05:29.810
<i>WITH $20 THAT I MAY HAVE TAKEN
OFF HER DRESSER FOR CAB FARE.</i>

05:31.313 --> 05:33.014
OK, THAT'S HORRENDOUSLY JERKY
- A LITTLE MORE.

05:33.081 --> 05:35.133
<i>A LITTLE MORE.</i>

05:35.200 --> 05:39.303
THE NEXT DAY, SHE CALLED MY ANSWERING
MACHINE AND LEFT THIS CRAZY MESSAGE.

05:39.371 --> 05:42.473
<i>AND SHE MAY HAVE
CAUGHT ME PLAYING IT</i>

05:42.541 --> 05:46.244
FOR A BUNCH OF MY BUDDIES
FOR OUR GENERAL AMUSEMENT.

05:46.311 --> 05:48.480
OH, MY GOD, DOUG.
YOU'RE A MONSTER!

05:48.547 --> 05:51.416
WHAT COULD'VE POSSIBLY
POSSESSED YOU TO ACT THAT WAY?

05:51.484 --> 05:53.017
WAS SHE SO AWFUL?

05:53.085 --> 05:53.817
I DON'T KNOW.

05:53.885 --> 05:56.838
SHE SAID THE WORD
"LITERALLY" A LOT.

05:56.905 --> 05:58.172
WHAT?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.492
<i>YEAH. IT'S LITERALLY THE
BEST MUFFIN I EVER HAD.</i>

06:00.559 --> 06:02.260
<i>OH, IT'S LITERALLY THE
FUNNIEST SHOW I EVER SAW.</i>

06:02.327 --> 06:03.694
AAGG.
YEAH. AAGG.

06:03.762 --> 06:06.347
I KNOW, WHAT A BITCH.
I WISH SHE WERE DEAD.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.783
I'M NOT PROUD OF WHAT I
DID, OK? I FEEL TERRIBLE.

06:08.851 --> 06:10.217
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO DROP THIS.

06:10.285 --> 06:11.603
NO, I CAN'T DROP THIS, OK?

06:11.670 --> 06:14.972
ON BEHALF OF ALL WOMEN, I THINK
I OWE IT TO HER TO HAVE LUNCH,

06:15.040 --> 06:17.776
AND WE'RE HAVING LOBSTER
THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR.

06:17.843 --> 06:21.112
FINE, BUT... WHATEVER BAD
STUFF SHE SAYS ABOUT ME,

06:21.179 --> 06:22.614
JUST REMEMBER THIS.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.034
AH, THAT WAS LITERALLY

06:43.101 --> 06:45.453
THE MOST ANNOYING WAITER
I'VE EVER HAD.

06:45.521 --> 06:47.488
OHH.
HE WAS ALL OVER US.

06:47.556 --> 06:49.440
DO YOU KNOW HE ACTUALLY
TRIED TO FILL MY ICED TEA

06:49.507 --> 06:51.442
<i>AS I WAS DRINKING IT.
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED.</i>

06:51.509 --> 06:52.877
I KNOW.
CRAZY.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.411
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA RUN UPSTAIRS.

06:54.479 --> 06:56.281
COULD YOU THROW THIS
IN THE FRIDGE? SURE.

07:01.019 --> 07:02.654
HEY, DOUG.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.656
I GUESS THERE'S
A LITTLE OUTLET THERE.

07:04.723 --> 07:06.591
THERE'S AN OUTLET THERE.
HEY.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.594
SO HOW WAS LUNCH? A LITTLE
MIDDAY LADY CHOW, HUH?

07:09.662 --> 07:11.496
IT WAS GREAT. WE HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

07:11.563 --> 07:14.181
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS
SAY ABOUT A GOOD LUNCH.

07:14.249 --> 07:16.684
JUST LIKE A GOOD DINNER.

07:16.752 --> 07:19.186
ONLY EARLIER AND...

07:19.254 --> 07:22.640
OFTEN A SANDWICH,
AS OPPOSED TO A PLATTER.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.841
DOUG, IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.

07:23.909 --> 07:25.943
I'M OVER WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.612
YOU ARE?
YEAH.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.430
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
IT DIDN'T HURT ME,

07:29.497 --> 07:31.198
BUT, UM, IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO

07:31.266 --> 07:34.618
AND I'VE LOST THE WEIGHT. THE WEIGHT?

07:34.686 --> 07:37.705
YEAH. I PUT ON ABOUT 100
POUNDS AFTER YOU DUMPED ME.

07:37.773 --> 07:39.423
ALL RIGHT. OK.

07:39.491 --> 07:40.975
I LOST THE WEIGHT.
I KICKED THE AMPHETAMINES,

07:41.043 --> 07:44.245
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, I TOOK TO
LOSE THE WEIGHT, AND I'VE MOVED ON.

07:44.313 --> 07:47.064
HEY, AT LEAST YOU HAD A FUN TIME
EATING YOUR WAY UP THAT HUNDRED POUNDS.

07:48.550 --> 07:51.119
I'VE LOST THE USE
OF ONE KIDNEY.

07:52.654 --> 07:53.605
BEEN THERE.

07:58.193 --> 08:04.364
LOOK, TRISH, I, UH, I NEVER OFFICIALLY
APOLOGIZED TO YOU. YOU KNOW, I-I...

08:04.432 --> 08:08.786
I ACTED LIKE A REAL JERK. ESPECIALLY
ABOUT THAT WHOLE ANSWERING MACHINE THING.

08:08.937 --> 08:12.039
IT'S, UH, IT'S FINE. I
OFFICIALLY ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

08:12.107 --> 08:16.711
AND, UM, YOU DID SET ME BACK
ABOUT A YEAR OR SO DATING-WISE,

08:16.779 --> 08:21.048
BUT, HEY, AS LONG AS I HAVE
A BABY BY 45, I'M ALL RIGHT.

08:22.785 --> 08:24.034
AND BESIDES, CARRIE'S
A WONDERFUL WOMAN,

08:24.102 --> 08:25.903
SO SOMETHING VERY GOOD
CAME OUT OF THIS.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.221
THAT IS GOOD.
YEAH, IT IS.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.723
HEY, SO DID THE LEFTOVERS
MAKE IT TO THE REFRIGERATOR,

08:29.791 --> 08:31.892
OR DID THIS ONE SWALLOW
EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE FOIL?

08:31.961 --> 08:33.193
OH, YOU'RE FUNNY.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.144
NO. THEY'RE OK
FOR NOW.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.596
I SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE OFF.

08:35.664 --> 08:36.647
OH, OK.
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

08:36.798 --> 08:38.030
ALL RIGHT.

08:38.099 --> 08:39.984
SO, WE STILL ON FOR
THAT SAKS SALE ON SATURDAY?

08:40.052 --> 08:41.552
OH, MY GOD,
YES, WE ARE.

08:41.619 --> 08:42.720
OK, I'LL CALL YOU.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.054
OK, BYE-BYE.
BYE.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.056
BYE-BYE.
BYE-BYE.

08:48.459 --> 08:50.344
WELL, THIS IS GREAT.
YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS,

08:50.412 --> 08:53.064
AND I DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
GUILTY. IT'S ALL GOOD.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.516
OH, MY GOD,
I CAN'T STAND HER.

08:57.502 --> 08:58.519
WHAT?

08:58.587 --> 09:01.506
DOUG, LUNCH WAS TORTURE.

09:01.573 --> 09:04.341
I MEAN, YOU ARE RIGHT.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HER-

09:04.410 --> 09:06.844
THE NEEDY THING,
THE "LITERALLY" THING.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.515
WHEN SHE ORDERED A SOUFFLE THAT
WAS GONNA TAKE A HALF HOUR AT LUNCH,

09:10.582 --> 09:14.419
I ALMOST DROVE A FORK
THROUGH MY HANDS.

09:14.486 --> 09:18.773
AFTER THE SAKS SALE IS OVER,
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE'S TOAST.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.976
YOU'RE JUST GONNA USE HER TO GET
WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN THROW HER AWAY?

09:22.044 --> 09:24.278
YEAH.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.696
YOU... CAN'T DO THAT,
CARRIE.

09:25.764 --> 09:27.698
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I DID WITH HER!

09:27.766 --> 09:30.367
AND YOU WERE RIGHT TO DO IT.
SHE'S UNBEARABLE.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.571
YOU SHOULD'VE STOLEN $80
FROM HER DRESSER.

09:33.639 --> 09:34.889
I CANNOT BE PART
OF THIS AGAIN.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.791
YOU CAN'T DUMP HER
AFTER SAKS.

09:36.858 --> 09:40.895
DOUG, SHE GETS
A 40% EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT

09:40.963 --> 09:43.564
ON ALREADY
MARKED DOWN ITEMS, OK?

09:43.631 --> 09:46.734
I HAVEN'T SHOPPED IN
3 MONTHS. THIS IS SAKS.

09:46.801 --> 09:48.903
THERE'S A REASON WHY
WINONA STOLE FROM THERE.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.437
THEIR STUFF IS GORGEOUS.

09:50.505 --> 09:52.406
THIS IS SO BAD.
THIS IS SO BAD.

09:52.474 --> 09:54.241
CARRIE, LOOK,
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, OK.

09:54.309 --> 09:55.743
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,

09:55.811 --> 09:58.178
YOU CAN'T DUMP HER THE
SAME WAY I DID, ALL RIGHT?

09:58.246 --> 09:59.413
YOU GOTTA LET HER
DOWN EASY.

09:59.481 --> 10:01.415
YOU GOTTA SEE HER A COUPLE
TIMES AFTER THE SALE.

10:01.483 --> 10:02.750
YOU KNOW,
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:02.818 --> 10:04.418
YOU GET BUSY,
SHE GETS BUSY,

10:04.486 --> 10:06.086
NOBODY HAS TO GET HURT.

10:06.154 --> 10:09.006
ALL RIGHT,
HOW MANY TIMES?

10:09.073 --> 10:11.425
5.
ABSOLUTELY NO.

10:11.493 --> 10:13.010
ALL RIGHT, 3.

10:13.078 --> 10:17.431
OK, BUT I'M ONLY SEEING HER,
LITERALLY, 3 TIMES, DOUG, OK?

10:17.499 --> 10:19.266
OH, MY GOD.
I CAUGHT IT.

10:23.805 --> 10:27.592
OK, THIS ONE'S $80 OFF.

10:27.659 --> 10:30.527
59 OFF. 30 OFF.

10:30.595 --> 10:32.112
OH, YEAH.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.047
105 OFF.
OHH!

10:34.115 --> 10:37.601
FOR A TOTAL SAVINGS
OF NEARLY $300.

10:38.587 --> 10:39.937
SO WHERE DO YOU
WANNA GO FOR LUNCH?

10:40.005 --> 10:41.471
I COULD LITERALLY
EAT ANYTHING.

10:41.539 --> 10:42.773
ACTUALLY, I GOTTA GO.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.665
OH, COME ON, GET 'IM,
GET 'IM, GET 'IM! GET 'IM,

10:51.733 --> 10:53.134
YES!
OH! IT'S A FUMBLE.

10:53.201 --> 10:55.069
FUMBLE!
THERE YOU GO!

10:55.137 --> 10:58.139
DO YOU GUYS THINK
I LOOK GOOD IN BLUE?

10:59.408 --> 11:00.808
EXCUSE ME?

11:00.875 --> 11:03.778
SPECIFICALLY, THAT BLUE TURTLENECK
I HAVE. YOU KNOW THE ONE.

11:03.845 --> 11:05.413
NO. I REALLY DON'T.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.381
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, IN
TERMS OF TURTLENECKS,

11:07.449 --> 11:09.884
YOU PROBABLY LOOK ENOUGH
LIKE A TURTLE ALREADY.

11:11.853 --> 11:14.755
THANKS. THANKS A LOT. WHAT'S YOUR
PROBLEM? IS IT THIS GUY AGAIN?

11:14.823 --> 11:16.773
YES! WE'VE BEEN OUT
4 TIMES,

11:16.842 --> 11:19.176
AND HE HASN'T MADE
HIS MOVE YET.

11:20.445 --> 11:22.246
THIS IS WAY BETTER
THAN THE GAME.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.899
I MEAN, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF.

11:24.966 --> 11:27.668
AND IT'S JUST MAKING ME FEEL
WORSE, SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:27.736 --> 11:30.855
MAYBE HE'S JUST
PLAYING HARD TO GET.

11:32.141 --> 11:34.158
I HOPE SO.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.244
I... OH, I GOTTA GO.
HE'S PICKING ME UP AT 8:00,

11:37.312 --> 11:38.913
AND I GOTTA DO SOMETHING
WITH MY HAIR.

11:39.981 --> 11:41.749
I SHOULD SPLIT, TOO.

11:41.817 --> 11:44.318
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

11:44.385 --> 11:45.286
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

11:53.144 --> 11:55.062
OH, HI, CARRIE.
IT'S TRISH.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.698
UM, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
GOT MY OTHER MESSAGES,

11:57.766 --> 11:59.967
I LEFT, LIKE, 4, BUT I
HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU

12:00.035 --> 12:02.637
IN LITERALLY AGES
SINCE THAT SAKS SALE.

12:02.704 --> 12:06.040
I MISS YOU. UM, ANYWAY,
I HOPE WE'RE STILL ON

12:06.107 --> 12:07.708
FOR THAT HUGH GRANT
MOVIE TONIGHT.

12:07.776 --> 12:09.710
I NEED MY CARRIE FIX.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.212
SO, I GUESS IF I
DON'T HEAR FROM YOU,

12:11.280 --> 12:15.550
WE SHOULD JUST MEET AT THE FAIRWAY
AT 9:00. OK, SO, OK, OK, BYE.

12:17.886 --> 12:18.536
HEY, HONEY.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.721
HEY. WHAT ARE
YOU UP TO?

12:20.789 --> 12:22.556
OH, I JUST STOPPED
AT THAT FALAFEL PLACE.

12:22.624 --> 12:26.227
I DON'T KNOW WHY I KEEP HAVING
FALAFEL. I KINDA HATE IT.

12:26.295 --> 12:29.563
WHAT DO YOU GOT
PLANNED FOR TONIGHT?

12:29.631 --> 12:31.065
NOTHING. WHY?

12:31.132 --> 12:33.867
'CAUSE TRISH JUST CALLED. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO MEET HER AT THE MOVIES.

12:33.935 --> 12:35.652
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED HER
SINCE SAKS, HAVE YOU?

12:35.720 --> 12:38.072
NO. I-I'VE, UM-

12:38.139 --> 12:39.574
YOU-YOU-YOU-YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:39.641 --> 12:42.910
WE HAD A DEAL. YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO SEE HER 3 MORE TIMES.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.878
YOU WANT HER TO GAIN
THAT HUNDRED POUNDS BACK?

12:44.946 --> 12:46.096
NO.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:46.164 --> 12:47.515
IF YOU DON'T MEET HER
AT THE MOVIES,

12:47.582 --> 12:49.517
SHE CAN GAIN 10 OF THEM TONIGHT ON
POPCORN AND LITTLE ICE CREAM BALLS.

12:49.584 --> 12:50.651
YOU'RE GOING.

12:50.719 --> 12:52.086
NO. I'M NOT GOING
TO THE MOVIES.

12:52.154 --> 12:53.988
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

12:54.056 --> 12:55.522
DOUG, LISTEN TO ME.

12:55.590 --> 12:59.026
I AM NOT GOING TO THE
MOVIES TONIGHT, OK?

12:59.094 --> 13:02.362
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SPEND
LISTENING TO TRISH FLINTOFF

13:02.430 --> 13:05.199
GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW
SHE MISSES ME SO MUCH

13:05.266 --> 13:07.735
WHEN WE ONLY MET
LAST WEEK.

13:07.803 --> 13:10.270
NOW, I KNOW YOU FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT HER,

13:10.338 --> 13:13.807
BUT I FEEL NOTHING.

13:23.218 --> 13:24.718
HEY, TRISHY.

13:24.786 --> 13:26.920
HEY, DOUG.
WHERE'S CARRIE?

13:26.988 --> 13:28.922
OH, UM, SHE
COULDN'T MAKE IT.

13:28.990 --> 13:32.460
SHE GOT SICK AND
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

13:32.527 --> 13:34.795
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S
GOT A LOT GOING ON.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.863
YEAH. SHE-SHE FELT BAD
THAT SHE COULDN'T BE HERE.

13:36.931 --> 13:38.599
ACTUALLY, SHE WANTED
TO SAY HI TO YOU.

13:38.666 --> 13:39.600
OH! YAY!

13:39.667 --> 13:40.867
HOLD ON A SECOND.

13:40.935 --> 13:42.369
HERE WE GO.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.210
HELLO.

13:49.277 --> 13:52.480
HEY, SWEETIE. I'M AT
THE MOVIES WITH TRISH.

13:52.547 --> 13:54.482
WHAT?

13:54.549 --> 13:57.218
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
GOING JOGGING.

13:57.285 --> 13:59.820
YEAH. ANYWAY, I WAS JUST
TELLING HER HOW SORRY YOU WERE

13:59.887 --> 14:02.656
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT
AND THAT YOU WANTED TO SAY HI TO HER.

14:02.724 --> 14:03.657
NO, NO, DOUG.
DON'T PUT HER ON.

14:03.725 --> 14:04.992
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO-

14:05.059 --> 14:06.827
HI!
HI, TRISH!

14:06.894 --> 14:11.232
HI. I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO YOU IN LITERALLY FOREVER.

14:11.299 --> 14:13.450
UH-HUH.

14:13.518 --> 14:15.619
DOUG SAID YOU HAD
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

14:15.687 --> 14:21.108
WHAT? OH, UH, YEAH.
I'M OK. I'M OK.

14:21.176 --> 14:26.847
IT'S JUST HARD WHEN, YOU KNOW,
YOUR FAMILY HAS... AN EMERGENCY.

14:26.914 --> 14:30.017
YOU KNOW, BUT WE'RE PULLING
THROUGH. WE'RE PULLING THROUGH.

14:30.084 --> 14:31.185
CAN I SPEAK TO DOUG
REAL QUICK?

14:31.253 --> 14:32.353
SURE.
THANKS.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.354
OK. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

14:33.421 --> 14:35.022
BYE-BYE.
BYE-BYE. BYE.

14:35.089 --> 14:37.758
AHEM. WHAT'S UP?

14:37.825 --> 14:39.009
LITERALLY FOREVER?

14:39.077 --> 14:41.912
I MEAN, DOES SHE KNOW
THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE?

14:41.980 --> 14:45.616
WHAT'S THAT? YOU WANNA INVITE HER TO
DINNER AT OUR HOUSE SATURDAY NIGHT?

14:45.683 --> 14:46.951
OH!
NO.

14:47.018 --> 14:49.353
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
I'LL ASK HER.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.388
DOUG, YOU BETTER STOP THIS,

14:50.538 --> 14:52.473
OR I SWEAR I WILL KILL YOU
IN YOUR SLEEP.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.342
7:00 SOUNDS REALLY GOOD. OK. I'LL
TALK TO YOU LATER, SWEETIE. BYE-BYE.

14:55.410 --> 14:58.312
SHE INVITED YOU TO OUR HOUSE
SATURDAY NIGHT FOR DINNER.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.881
OOH, SATURDAY NIGHT. I'VE
BEEN BUMPED UP TO THE "A" LIST.

15:00.948 --> 15:02.349
YEAH.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.497
IT'S, UH, CHILLY
IN HERE, ISN'T IT?

15:17.566 --> 15:18.499
A LITTLE.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.000
BRR. HA HA.

15:20.068 --> 15:23.003
THE, UH, SEATS ARE
REAL COMFY THOUGH.

15:23.071 --> 15:25.172
YOU CAN JUST
SNUGGLE RIGHT IN.

15:26.741 --> 15:28.509
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.017
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:37.085 --> 15:39.320
WHAT?

15:39.387 --> 15:41.005
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK IS GOING ON HERE,

15:41.073 --> 15:42.473
BUT I'M NOT GAY.

15:42.540 --> 15:43.441
WELL, NEITHER AM I.

15:44.926 --> 15:47.227
THEN WHY DID YOU TRY TO
PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME?

15:47.295 --> 15:49.863
MY GIRLFRIEND DUMPED ME.
IT'S A VERY CONFUSING TIME.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.967
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.

15:54.035 --> 15:56.704
MAYBE IT'S BETTER
IF I JUST HEAD OUT.

15:56.771 --> 15:58.972
FINE! LEAVE
LIKE THEY ALL DO.

16:11.386 --> 16:12.986
WOW, THESE ARE
REALLY GOOD.

16:13.054 --> 16:14.321
OH, THANK YOU.

16:14.389 --> 16:15.656
EVERY TIME I GET INVITED TO
SOMEBODY'S HOUSE FOR DINNER,

16:15.724 --> 16:17.157
I GOTTA MAKE EMPANADAS.

16:17.225 --> 16:18.325
I LEARNED HOW
IN ARGENTINA.

16:18.393 --> 16:19.560
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN?

16:19.628 --> 16:20.561
NO.

16:20.629 --> 16:24.048
OH, YOU HAVE TO GO.
IT'S SO WONDERFUL.

16:24.115 --> 16:26.217
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT
OF MONEY TO TRAVEL RIGHT NOW.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.219
GO ON THE INTERNET. THEY
HAVE REALLY CHEAP TICKETS.

16:28.286 --> 16:30.054
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S
STILL KINDA HARD TO GET-

16:30.121 --> 16:31.171
YEAH.
NO, GO TO ARGENTINA.

16:31.239 --> 16:33.507
OK. OK. OK.

16:34.742 --> 16:37.061
HEY, CAR, HOW ARE WE
DOING ON THOSE DRINKS?

16:37.128 --> 16:39.246
THEY'RE COMING!

16:39.314 --> 16:42.048
EGGROLLS IN THE HOUSE.
OH, AND GOOD NEWS.

16:42.117 --> 16:43.617
CHEF MING HAD THE BABY.

16:43.684 --> 16:45.385
HA HA. BRIAN.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.356
HOL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:49.424 --> 16:51.291
CARRIE
INVITED ME OVER.

16:51.359 --> 16:52.792
DID SHE?

16:52.860 --> 16:55.462
WELL, LET ME JUST
DROP THIS OFF HERE.

16:57.532 --> 17:00.367
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? ARE YOU
TRYING TO PALM TRISH OFF ON HOLLY?

17:00.435 --> 17:03.970
NO. HOLLY DROPPED BY, AND I
INVITED HER TO STAY FOR DINNER.

17:04.038 --> 17:06.373
I LIKE PEOPLE, DOUG.

17:06.441 --> 17:08.342
CARRIE, I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE.

17:08.410 --> 17:10.344
HERE'S YOUR 30 BUCKS BACK.

17:13.214 --> 17:14.714
YOU'RE PAYING HER?

17:14.781 --> 17:16.715
I TOLD YOU, DOUG. I
COULDN'T DO THIS, OK?

17:16.784 --> 17:18.152
LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

17:18.219 --> 17:20.887
I KNOW. AND NOW I THINK
I HAVE TO GO TO ARGENTINA.

17:20.954 --> 17:22.656
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:22.723 --> 17:23.890
I'M JUST GONNA END THIS,
OK?

17:23.958 --> 17:25.959
I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT
THERE AND TELL TRISH

17:26.027 --> 17:28.262
THAT SHE SAYS
"LITERALLY" TOO MUCH,

17:28.329 --> 17:31.298
AND I'M GONNA GIVE THIS LOVELY
CHINESE FOOD AS A PARTING GIFT.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.667
NO. WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT A SECOND.

17:33.735 --> 17:36.169
LOOK, I STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING.

17:36.237 --> 17:38.672
I SHOULD END IT
LIKE A MAN.

17:38.740 --> 17:41.575
I OWE HER THAT MUCH.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.677
OK. HOLLY, YOU WANNA SEE MY NEW CLOTHES?

17:43.745 --> 17:44.712
SURE.
OK.

17:46.898 --> 17:47.831
HI.

17:47.899 --> 17:48.933
THERE YOU ARE.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.201
I THOUGHT YOU
LITERALLY GOT LOST

17:50.268 --> 17:52.686
ON YOUR WAY BACK
FROM THE KITCHEN.

17:52.753 --> 17:53.937
HA HA HA HA.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.607
AH, TRISH,
YOU...

17:57.675 --> 18:00.010
ARE AN INCREDIBLE
PERSON.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.011
THANK YOU.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.146
YOU REALLY ARE,
YOU KNOW.

18:02.213 --> 18:07.617
YOU'RE FUN. YOU'RE A
GREAT EMPANADA MAKER.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.621
AND YOU'RE
A GREAT FRIEND...

18:11.689 --> 18:14.658
FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT CARRIE.

18:14.725 --> 18:17.294
WHAT?

18:17.361 --> 18:20.130
CARRIE DOESN'T REALLY
THINK IT'S IN THE CARDS

18:20.198 --> 18:22.299
FOR YOU TWO
TO BE FRIENDS.

18:22.366 --> 18:23.801
IT'S NOT YOU,
YOU KNOW.

18:23.868 --> 18:25.803
SOMETIMES THE CHEMISTRY
IS NOT RIGHT.

18:25.870 --> 18:29.639
AND I THINK IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE BEST

18:29.707 --> 18:34.644
IF WE ALL JUST KINDA,
YOU KNOW, MOVED ON.

18:36.214 --> 18:38.515
PLEASE DON'T
START EATING.

18:40.718 --> 18:45.088
WELL, UH, THAT'S ACTUALLY
THE MOST MATURE WAY

18:45.156 --> 18:49.126
ANYONE HAS EVER HANDLED
THIS KIND OF THING WITH ME.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.444
REALLY?

18:50.511 --> 18:52.880
YEAH, UM, I'M NOT HAPPY.

18:52.947 --> 18:56.182
BUT I GOT A GREAT FRIEND
IN HOLLY OUT OF IT, SO...

18:56.250 --> 18:58.318
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

18:59.987 --> 19:01.655
I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA TAKE OFF.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.423
SO, WILL YOU SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THEM FOR ME?

19:03.491 --> 19:04.625
DEFINITELY, YEAH.

19:04.692 --> 19:06.260
THANKS.

19:06.327 --> 19:08.428
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR
HONESTY. IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

19:08.496 --> 19:10.530
OH, NO PROBLEM.
MY PLEASURE, YOU KNOW.

19:10.598 --> 19:15.369
LIFE'S A LONG ROAD, AND WE
ALL STOP FOR GAS, YOU KNOW.

19:21.108 --> 19:22.108
IS SHE GONE?

19:22.176 --> 19:23.026
YEAH.

19:23.094 --> 19:24.878
CARRIE, YOU CAN
COME DOWN NOW.

19:26.947 --> 19:28.114
IS IT DONE?

19:28.182 --> 19:29.783
YEAH, IT'S DONE.

19:29.850 --> 19:31.885
OH, GOD, DOUG, COME ON,
HONEY, LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

19:31.952 --> 19:34.854
THIS WAY SHE'LL BE FORCED TO
TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT HERSELF

19:34.922 --> 19:37.457
AND COME UP WITH
A BETTER PERSONALITY.

19:37.525 --> 19:40.059
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH.

19:40.127 --> 19:41.194
SHE'S A NICE PERSON.

19:41.262 --> 19:42.730
HAH. SERIOUSLY,
DOUG, COME ON.

19:42.797 --> 19:45.232
SHE'S A FREAK SHOW.
YEAH. I HAVE TO AGREE.

19:45.299 --> 19:46.466
SHE'S NOT.

19:46.534 --> 19:48.052
SERIOUSLY.
REALLY.

19:48.119 --> 19:50.554
HAVE YOU LISTENED TO THE
MESSAGES SHE LEFT ME? LISTEN.

19:51.622 --> 19:53.557
DON'T.
YEAH.

19:53.624 --> 19:55.225
SO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM YOU IN A WHILE.

19:55.293 --> 19:57.394
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO ANNOY YOU?

19:57.462 --> 19:59.396
