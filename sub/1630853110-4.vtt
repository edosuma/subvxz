00:12.888 --> 00:14.640
(in Korean) Are you certain?

00:14.723 --> 00:17.351
Really, it'll cost the same as a new one.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.355
(in Japanese) Koh-<i>san</i> !

00:21.438 --> 00:22.689
Your timing is perfect.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.483
Your new suit is ready.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.611
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.323
You can serve me after the pastor.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.494
I'm in no rush.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.539
Yes.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.294
I didn't realize it was so obvious.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.881
Do I really look like
that much of a pastor?

00:53.929 --> 00:56.640
I make it my business to know
what happens around here.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.352
When I hear a newcomer comes
bearing illness…

01:01.603 --> 01:03.814
I pay attention.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.070
I am well now.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.030
No need for concern.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.365
That is good to hear.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.915
Your clothes really don't suit you.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.918
So it seems.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.173
This suit belonged
to my late older brother.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.763
Did he die of the same illness?

01:39.183 --> 01:40.184
No.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.394
My brother, Samoel,

01:43.145 --> 01:44.897
he was never ill a day in his life.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.154
The Independence Movement.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.782
I was just a boy then.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.495
He was one of those taken.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.710
And we never saw him again.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.295
So a martyr, then?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.010
To me, just my brother.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.601
Well, it matters how a man
presents himself to the world.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.604
Those first impressions follow you.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.066
I know from experience.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.653
And how does the world see me now?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.030
Like a man who does not matter.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.201
Why wear clothes that don't fit you?

02:40.327 --> 02:44.623
Hanging on to the past, it looks pathetic.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.338
Are you sure
we are still talking about a suit?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.680
Get a new one, Pastor.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.348
I'll pay for it.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.456
Do not concern yourself.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.918
I can pay for my own suit.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.129
I apologize for the wait.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.965
I wanted to check
the stitchings once more.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.426
Please make sure it fits properly.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.473
Kinoshita-<i>san</i> ,

03:44.183 --> 03:45.726
I have decided to get a new suit.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.061
I will need it right away.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.272
I want to wear it
for my upcoming nuptials.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.482
What wonderful news.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.195
Congratulations! I will make sure
it lasts you for many, many years to come.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.281
And please, re-hem this one as well.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.450
Even if it doesn't fit me,

04:01.533 --> 04:02.576
who knows.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.703
My son might grow into it one day.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.829
A wise idea.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.458
I'll have your wedding suit ready first.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.751
Three days.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.587
I'll return then.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.025
Do you understand
the consequences of this?

05:59.526 --> 06:02.946
For an unmarried woman to be with child,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.699
it's a serious blight.

06:06.909 --> 06:10.287
And then to claim a child
that is not yours?

06:12.039 --> 06:15.584
I assure you I have put much thought
and prayer into the matter.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.129
Pastor Shin, these women
risked their lives to save mine.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.508
I owe them this gratitude.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.979
Rise, child.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.489
Look at me.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.831
You have brought a dark scourge
upon not only yourself and your child,

06:55.415 --> 06:56.750
but also your family,

06:57.584 --> 07:01.088
and this man's good name.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.256
Do you understand?

07:03.841 --> 07:07.135
Pastor, is this necessary?

07:08.178 --> 07:11.682
It gives me no comfort to say such things,

07:12.266 --> 07:15.561
but we live in difficult, callous times.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.190
Even good people find themselves

07:21.400 --> 07:24.778
preying upon the weakness of others.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.287
Do you understand the nature of your sin?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.794
Forgive me.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.297
Forgive you?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.341
My child, I am not the one to forgive.

07:47.050 --> 07:51.430
It is to God
who you must direct your prayers.

07:54.349 --> 07:59.271
I know you do not come
from a family of believers, so I must ask,

08:00.522 --> 08:01.732
can you sincerely

08:02.774 --> 08:04.985
commit to the Lord?

08:12.910 --> 08:13.911
I can.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.794
Both of you, come closer.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.476
Dear Father,

08:39.977 --> 08:44.316
I ask you today to bless this union
between these two people.

08:47.069 --> 08:51.156
I pray that through your mercy,

08:51.823 --> 08:55.327
they seize upon this opportunity
for redemption.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.165
Teach them

09:00.249 --> 09:05.212
that the spiritual ties that
bind them together as husband and wife

09:06.338 --> 09:08.131
must remain impregnable.

09:09.925 --> 09:15.514
And show them how to care for
and respect one another.

09:17.391 --> 09:23.230
May a true, deep love blossom.

09:24.982 --> 09:31.405
In Jesus's name we pray.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.992
Amen.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
Sir.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.345
Hello.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.516
That boardinghouse
must be keeping you busy.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.602
It's been ages!

10:01.685 --> 10:02.853
Yes.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.439
It's been so long since I've been here,

10:05.981 --> 10:08.066
I hardly remember my way around.

10:08.150 --> 10:12.529
Well, those boarders of yours
must be getting their money's worth.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.866
Didn't I send your daughter off
with two sacks of barley last week?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.701
And you're already out?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.203
How much more do you need?

10:20.829 --> 10:22.414
I'm here for white rice.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.792
I'm not asking for much.

10:27.753 --> 10:28.795
Just two bowls.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.049
I'll pay more if I must.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.011
You must know,
I can't sell that rice to just anyone.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.181
If an official came in here

10:39.264 --> 10:42.142
and saw I didn't have enough
for the Japanese customers,

10:42.226 --> 10:44.269
I'd be in deep trouble.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.522
You know my other grains are high quality.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.194
My daughter was married today.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.278
Sunja?

10:53.362 --> 10:54.988
Really?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.449
Why didn't you say so?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.912
It must ease your mind
to know she is settled.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.747
He is a good man.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.250
We are very fortunate.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.043
In that case,

11:08.126 --> 11:10.587
some millet just came in this morning.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.258
I'll give it to you
for the price of the barley.

11:18.971 --> 11:19.972
Soon,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.350
she'll follow her husband to Japan.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.105
I don't have much
to offer them for a dowry.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.442
But a taste of her own country
before she leaves home…

11:35.195 --> 11:37.155
I would like to give her that.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.063
Three bowls.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.482
Thank you.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.401
Perhaps the taste of it

12:15.485 --> 12:18.989
will swallow
some of your sorrow as well.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.400
Shall we pray?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.744
Almighty Father,

15:12.037 --> 15:14.039
please bless this bountiful feast,

15:16.333 --> 15:17.835
and watch over this house

15:18.710 --> 15:20.879
and the good people who dwell here.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.678
In their times of need,

15:28.971 --> 15:30.264
be a comfort to them.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.228
Through Jesus Christ. Amen.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.457
How will we get by
without your mother's cooking?

16:01.545 --> 16:04.923
Perhaps this is why
you are so strong, Sunja.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.387
Is your sister-in-law a good cook?

16:14.141 --> 16:17.978
It's strange to think
of Kyunghee cooking at all.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.355
Her family was once very wealthy.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.578
Mrs. Jang says, in America,

17:16.662 --> 17:20.165
people don't even ask their elders
for permission to marry.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.459
Can you imagine?

17:23.794 --> 17:24.920
For us,

17:25.002 --> 17:28.549
I guess our suitors would
have to ask Sunja's mother

17:29.132 --> 17:30.342
since we're orphans.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.138
I hope I can have rice cakes
on my wedding day.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.850
Who would you eat them with?

17:37.933 --> 17:39.643
You, of course.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.353
Bokhee will be there too.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.897
And your mother, the Chung Brothers,

17:45.023 --> 17:46.275
even the one who doesn't like me.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.570
He's quiet with everyone.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.613
He's such a terrible old man.

17:52.322 --> 17:56.410
He gave me the meanest look yesterday
just because I dropped his pipe.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.911
Nothing happened to it,

17:58.412 --> 18:00.289
and I still burst into tears.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.460
But it doesn't seem right
to invite the two brothers and not him.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.630
Oh, and Pharmacist Chu.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.924
He seems like such a nice man.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.509
Will you stop this ridiculous talk!

18:13.635 --> 18:15.679
When will you get some sense
in that feeble brain of yours?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.933
You and I, we have no family.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.353
No name, no dowry.

18:25.147 --> 18:28.984
Our only option is to take
a man just as penniless.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.071
And then what?

18:34.615 --> 18:36.283
We can't afford to live together.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.958
And if we had children…

18:47.544 --> 18:50.714
we'd just be bringing them
into the same miserable poverty.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.593
So what's the point?

18:55.594 --> 18:57.679
Why bother dealing with marriage

18:58.722 --> 19:01.058
when we aren't even
entitled to any of its benefits?

19:05.479 --> 19:06.939
That's how it is for us.

19:11.276 --> 19:15.280
That's how it will always be for us.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.319
<i>With no signs of slowing,</i>

19:54.403 --> 19:56.321
<i>the Nikkei continues to rise.</i>

19:56.405 --> 19:58.740
<i>At the close of yesterday's market,</i>

19:58.824 --> 20:02.035
<i>the index nearly reached 33,000.</i>

20:03.370 --> 20:06.373
<i>This has led
some influential analysts to predict</i>

20:06.456 --> 20:10.377
<i>the market could surge to 45,000
by the year's end,</i>

20:10.878 --> 20:12.296
<i>further fueling speculation</i>

20:12.379 --> 20:16.383
<i>that Japan will overtake the United States</i>

20:16.466 --> 20:18.594
<i>as the world's richest nation.</i>

22:26.972 --> 22:28.307
You're early.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.184
Yes.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.978
I suppose it's not just me

22:33.562 --> 22:35.063
who is eager to close this deal.

22:35.814 --> 22:36.815
I suppose we are.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.403
You don't like me.

22:42.613 --> 22:43.739
Is that a problem?

22:44.656 --> 22:46.533
You will be leaving, isn't that so?

22:50.037 --> 22:53.123
Is that how you felt about Tom
when he first arrived?

22:53.207 --> 22:54.875
That he didn't belong here?

22:55.751 --> 22:58.504
Or did the affair just begin right away?

23:01.089 --> 23:02.257
Well,

23:02.341 --> 23:04.760
I don't care what the two of you do.

23:05.302 --> 23:09.765
Just like I don't care if you
and everyone else here is jealous of me.

23:10.557 --> 23:14.686
All that matters
is that she signs the deal.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.067
Baek-<i>san</i> , how many copies of the contract
do we need?

23:20.150 --> 23:21.652
I wrote it down on the memo.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.280
Please read it.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.672
Do you know
how he came to be at Shiffley's?

23:42.673 --> 23:45.551
No. Why's that important?

23:47.261 --> 23:48.762
Before Shiffley's,

23:49.638 --> 23:52.224
Arimoto was with the top bank
in the country.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.311
But over the years,
Arimoto saw his fellow colleagues rise,

23:56.395 --> 23:59.606
while he was left behind.

24:00.858 --> 24:03.777
His superiors warned
that he was not contributing to his team.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.321
They tried shaming him
through rigorous training to do better.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.907
But he was unable
to meet his superiors' expectations.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.994
I heard he was let go shortly afterwards.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.291
Your father, Baek-<i>san</i> ,

24:18.417 --> 24:19.918
he's in the pachinko business, no?

24:22.921 --> 24:23.922
So?

24:25.966 --> 24:29.386
You didn't grow up living
under the shadows of the Japanese company.

24:30.596 --> 24:32.472
You don't understand

24:32.556 --> 24:35.684
that for a salaryman,
the company is your family,

24:35.767 --> 24:38.187
sometimes even more so
than your own flesh and blood.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.982
When I was a girl,

24:42.065 --> 24:44.902
I would record the number of minutes
I saw my father each day.

24:46.570 --> 24:49.364
If they added up to more than an hour,

24:49.448 --> 24:51.450
I would consider that to be better
than an average week.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.494
So now you understand.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.790
Arimoto wasn't just fired…

25:00.792 --> 25:02.377
he was disowned by his family.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.548
And after that,

25:06.632 --> 25:09.843
no other major corporation would have him.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.763
That's how he came to be with us.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.767
That makes no sense.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.229
Shiffley's is a top firm.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.813
In America, perhaps.

25:22.314 --> 25:26.276
But here, this is the graveyard
where people like the Arimotos go.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.114
Why are you here then?

25:32.366 --> 25:34.993
You're from a good school, a good family.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.331
Yes, because of that, I was sought after

25:39.414 --> 25:42.751
by all the top banks in the country.

25:45.128 --> 25:48.924
But against my parents' wishes,
I chose Shiffley's.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.136
You see, as a woman,

25:53.220 --> 25:57.558
it helps to be surrounded
by those less accomplished.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.979
Here, I can rise.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.654
What will your mother do without you?

26:13.031 --> 26:14.700
Oh, my.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.745
Not today. It's my gift to you.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.539
But--

26:20.622 --> 26:21.707
Rush home now.

26:21.790 --> 26:22.791
Hurry!

27:18.972 --> 27:20.224
Is something wrong?

27:33.320 --> 27:34.696
You need to go with him.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.243
Go on.

27:47.042 --> 27:48.293
Leave us.

28:02.474 --> 28:03.809
What are you doing?

28:05.477 --> 28:07.896
I can't be seen alone with you.

28:22.703 --> 28:24.079
Do you feel safe now?

28:29.001 --> 28:30.919
You've really done it, haven't you?

28:32.421 --> 28:34.256
You married that fool.

28:36.758 --> 28:40.012
All illusions, with no inkling
of how this world truly runs.

28:43.223 --> 28:46.143
Yes, we've met.

28:50.439 --> 28:52.107
Why have you brought me here?

28:52.191 --> 28:53.942
To tell you not to delude yourself.

28:54.443 --> 28:56.945
Do you really think he married you
because he's some saint?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.659
That's not what I saw.

29:04.703 --> 29:09.499
I saw a sickly man who couldn't burden
himself to any other woman but you.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.168
How can you speak of him like that?

29:11.668 --> 29:13.128
He is my husband now.

29:14.713 --> 29:16.507
He did what you could not.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.593
I offered you so much more.

29:20.928 --> 29:23.430
You offered me shame. Nothing more.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.684
I have heard whispers…

29:29.186 --> 29:31.897
of who you are over there, of what you do.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.984
It sickens me.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.198
Whispers…

29:43.283 --> 29:45.536
And those whispers,

29:46.537 --> 29:48.539
do they also tell you
about the life you'll find over there?

29:49.790 --> 29:51.875
You said it had everything.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.794
Sure, if you have money.

29:53.877 --> 29:54.878
If you don't…

29:57.005 --> 30:01.552
I have seen and lived
what it is like for us over there.

30:02.302 --> 30:06.515
And I'm telling you that you will suffer.
Our son will as well.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.109
Sunja…

30:24.783 --> 30:26.535
Do you really think you can forget me?

30:28.203 --> 30:29.288
Do you?

30:33.584 --> 30:35.419
Even in your decent marriage…

30:37.713 --> 30:40.132
your thoughts will return to me.

30:49.850 --> 30:50.851
Don't go.

30:57.566 --> 30:59.026
That is my blood you carry.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.365
No.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.826
This is my child.

31:10.579 --> 31:12.748
- Mine.
- You stupid girl!

31:13.540 --> 31:16.043
You're as much of a fool
as that husband of yours.

31:20.005 --> 31:21.006
Fine.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.176
Go to Osaka.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.224
There, you will call for me
and beg me to save you.

31:35.521 --> 31:37.356
But I won't even remember your name.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.712
How are we to go on without you?

32:00.796 --> 32:03.340
Who will give me a stern look
when I ask for too much food?

32:03.423 --> 32:07.010
Don't worry.
You'll still have Donghee and Bokhee.

32:07.761 --> 32:10.389
Those two just like to laugh at me.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.599
I'm their cheap entertainment.

32:16.353 --> 32:19.022
A parting gift from me and my brothers.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.150
Please take it.

32:24.361 --> 32:25.654
Thank you.

32:40.419 --> 32:42.379
I can't do it.

32:45.299 --> 32:47.134
I thought I could,

32:48.010 --> 32:49.344
but I can't.

32:50.929 --> 32:53.682
I can't bear you going.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.186
You must.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.444
But still…

33:07.070 --> 33:08.488
you must do something for me.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.742
Can you promise?

33:20.083 --> 33:21.502
My mother…

33:26.507 --> 33:28.008
will you look after her?

33:45.400 --> 33:46.401
Don't cry.

33:54.493 --> 33:56.620
The man who made them,

33:57.913 --> 34:02.084
he says ducks mate for life.

34:03.669 --> 34:05.212
Bokhee, it's too much.

34:05.796 --> 34:07.464
You must return this.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.221
Build yourself a good life over there,

34:14.304 --> 34:15.472
you hear me?

34:19.893 --> 34:21.937
It won't be easy.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.693
But it is a new start for you.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.280
Don't squander it.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.205
Enough now. They'll never leave.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.793
Mother, I can take those.

34:45.878 --> 34:47.880
Never mind these. You just lead the way.

34:48.422 --> 34:50.424
- Please--
- Enough!

35:34.551 --> 35:35.552
Mother.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.599
Are you sure you want to go back?

35:43.644 --> 35:46.355
What are you talking about?
We already paid for the tickets.

35:46.438 --> 35:47.439
Come on.

35:59.409 --> 36:02.120
We've been expecting you.
This way, please.

36:18.095 --> 36:19.429
It's a pleasure to meet you.

36:21.014 --> 36:22.850
Tom Andrews, Shiffley Bank.

36:26.645 --> 36:28.605
I'm Abe from Waei Enterprises.

36:31.775 --> 36:34.570
Grandmother, it is good to see you again.

36:37.406 --> 36:39.658
Enough! Let's just get on with it.

36:49.293 --> 36:51.378
You'll be more comfortable waiting here.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.886
I must go get our travel papers approved.

37:15.652 --> 37:17.154
She's a famous singer, apparently.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.531
She's so beautiful.

37:23.702 --> 37:24.828
Wait!

37:31.543 --> 37:32.961
Thank you.

37:33.045 --> 37:34.713
Someone I care about gave this to me.

37:38.258 --> 37:39.510
When is your child due?

37:42.346 --> 37:43.680
We expect in two months.

37:44.848 --> 37:46.975
But you are leaving home?

37:49.561 --> 37:52.022
I've just been married.

37:56.193 --> 37:57.361
I see.

37:59.029 --> 38:04.243
Then tonight, I'll sing for us all.

38:06.787 --> 38:07.871
I wish you well.

38:17.714 --> 38:20.217
<i>We welcome you
as our distinguished guests today.</i>

38:21.051 --> 38:27.266
As the Americans have warmly welcomed
the Japanese on US soil,

38:27.933 --> 38:29.518
we now feel the same generous spirit here.

38:30.102 --> 38:31.812
And I'm certain,

38:32.938 --> 38:35.315
when the hotel opens,

38:36.191 --> 38:38.944
we can convince Colton Hotels to throw in…

38:40.028 --> 38:42.531
a suite for the weekend.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.828
Now then, let's get started.

38:48.328 --> 38:52.291
As we've already received your consent
to the agreement… Excuse me.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.337
…we have ten copies of the agreement
here for signature.

38:58.964 --> 38:59.965
Excuse me.

39:00.674 --> 39:06.221
Please sign
where there is a highlighted mark.

39:06.305 --> 39:07.306
Excuse me.

39:21.862 --> 39:23.488
It's the same contract we walked through.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.826
You haven't even looked at it.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.204
How can you be so sure?

39:37.169 --> 39:40.547
<i>You cannot afford to make a mistake.</i>

39:41.048 --> 39:42.549
Not over there.

39:44.968 --> 39:46.345
As a wife,

39:46.428 --> 39:47.846
as a mother,

39:47.930 --> 39:49.765
you must be absolutely flawless.

39:49.848 --> 39:50.849
Do you hear me?

39:51.808 --> 39:52.809
I understand.

39:54.436 --> 39:57.564
And you must be good to your in-laws.
Understand?

40:02.152 --> 40:04.988
They may be unfair to you, cruel even.

40:06.031 --> 40:07.199
Be patient,

40:08.283 --> 40:09.868
and be grateful, you understand?

40:14.039 --> 40:16.416
It is not easy feeding an extra mouth.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.169
And Sunja…

40:24.132 --> 40:26.093
even though you are with child…

40:28.804 --> 40:30.138
and it may be unpleasant…

40:33.600 --> 40:35.978
you must see to
your husband's physical needs.

40:37.145 --> 40:38.856
The pastor is a man first.

40:41.608 --> 40:43.277
Even decent men have been known

40:44.736 --> 40:46.446
to take comfort with other women.

40:48.949 --> 40:51.326
I wonder how you even got pregnant at all.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.787
You must know these things now.

41:05.549 --> 41:06.884
Long ago,

41:06.967 --> 41:08.302
your father's mother gave me these…

41:12.639 --> 41:16.560
once she was sure I wouldn't run off
in the middle of the night.

41:18.979 --> 41:20.272
Hide them in a safe place.

41:20.856 --> 41:23.066
Don't even tell your husband, you hear?

41:23.692 --> 41:26.820
It's important for a woman
to have money hidden away.

41:28.030 --> 41:32.659
Things can happen,
and we don't have the same choices as men.

41:35.037 --> 41:37.497
No, you keep those.

41:38.790 --> 41:39.791
I have…

41:42.294 --> 41:43.295
this.

41:44.505 --> 41:46.089
What is this?

41:50.761 --> 41:51.929
Is this from the father?

41:52.012 --> 41:53.555
Is this from him?

41:55.307 --> 41:56.475
What kind…

42:02.022 --> 42:04.024
What does it matter now?

42:06.318 --> 42:07.486
Sunja.

42:08.362 --> 42:11.365
You must forget him now.

42:11.448 --> 42:12.908
Understand?

42:12.991 --> 42:14.576
I know.

42:24.711 --> 42:25.921
Here.

42:26.588 --> 42:28.465
Your father would want you to have these.

42:32.469 --> 42:35.639
He wanted so much for you.

42:38.642 --> 42:42.187
Here I was, wanting your roots
planted firmly in the ground…

42:45.232 --> 42:47.734
but your father wanted you to fly.

42:59.955 --> 43:02.165
There will be many difficult days ahead.

43:05.294 --> 43:07.337
I don't know when
we will see one another again.

43:09.798 --> 43:11.633
It may be a very long time.

43:17.139 --> 43:18.140
There now.

43:18.849 --> 43:21.059
Pour out all your tears here.

43:23.187 --> 43:25.272
I don't want them to fall over there.

43:28.650 --> 43:31.153
- My daughter.
- They're boarding now.

43:32.779 --> 43:35.532
Mother! Mother!

44:11.610 --> 44:12.611
I feel sick.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.337
Mother,

44:31.129 --> 44:33.340
you're keeping
all these important people waiting.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.635
Look at how many of them there are.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.931
They must have other appointments as well.

45:02.619 --> 45:04.329
Grandmother, you won.

45:06.373 --> 45:09.334
Today you'll secure great wealth
for your children and their children.

45:11.044 --> 45:14.256
Never again
will they have to worry for money.

45:14.923 --> 45:16.758
That sounds like a curse to me.

45:17.259 --> 45:20.512
Do you know
what my grandmother is doing today?

45:20.596 --> 45:23.182
She's flying back to Korea
for the first time since leaving home.

45:25.267 --> 45:27.978
Fifty years ago,
she came here with nothing.

45:28.812 --> 45:30.939
But today she goes back in first class.

45:33.317 --> 45:34.902
Now that's something.

45:43.327 --> 45:48.790
Look at these lowlifes!
Now the whole ship stinks of their shit.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.835
I should go elsewhere.

45:51.919 --> 45:54.213
Wait here. I'll bring you water.

45:54.838 --> 45:57.674
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

45:58.926 --> 46:00.260
Don't leave me.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.845
I'll be right back.

47:03.907 --> 47:08.161
I hope you enjoy my repertoire tonight.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.267
Where can I find water?

47:50.370 --> 47:53.707
Who are all of you here?

47:53.790 --> 47:57.377
We're going over to work in the mines.
The company's paying for our travel over.

47:57.461 --> 47:59.421
And the women and children?

47:59.505 --> 48:00.797
Where are your families?

48:01.507 --> 48:05.177
They say if we do well, they'll pay
for our families to join us later.

48:09.890 --> 48:15.103
<i>My father was the first one to come.</i>

48:18.357 --> 48:23.111
Me and my mother,
we followed a few years later.

48:24.196 --> 48:25.656
Madam, is this--

48:31.578 --> 48:36.625
He came over to work the mines in Chikuho.

48:38.377 --> 48:41.505
The conditions were terrible.

48:41.588 --> 48:46.593
So bad that he and the 400 other
Korean miners decided to strike.

48:47.928 --> 48:48.929
What's going on?

48:49.012 --> 48:50.597
But,

48:50.681 --> 48:56.103
they lasted 20 days
before they were all fired.

49:03.944 --> 49:08.407
Back then,
no one wanted to rent to us Koreans.

49:09.241 --> 49:13.203
They said we were too dirty, too loud.

49:17.499 --> 49:19.042
They were right.

49:19.710 --> 49:22.963
We were too dirty. We were too loud.

49:24.006 --> 49:27.634
Because we had to crowd two,
three families

49:27.718 --> 49:32.973
into one room so as to afford
the jacked-up rents.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.642
That's all behind us now.

49:40.522 --> 49:41.857
If you really believe that…

49:43.817 --> 49:47.988
then you're a bigger idiot than I thought.

50:00.167 --> 50:03.253
They called us cockroaches.

50:03.337 --> 50:05.839
They said we needed
to be pounded into the ground.

50:07.925 --> 50:09.510
Think about that.

50:11.220 --> 50:13.055
They're talking about you.

50:18.936 --> 50:20.187
Grandmother…

51:03.230 --> 51:05.315
What is this singing?

51:24.835 --> 51:29.131
- Do you hear that?
- That's our music. Come now!

51:38.932 --> 51:41.101
Drag her off the stage!

51:41.185 --> 51:43.145
- What is this?
- Where are the guards?

51:43.228 --> 51:44.688
Get her down immediately!

51:44.771 --> 51:46.231
Make her stop!

51:46.315 --> 51:47.608
Where are the guards?

51:54.448 --> 51:55.866
Let me hear you say it.

52:00.245 --> 52:01.580
If it was your grandmother…

52:04.208 --> 52:08.170
sitting here,
staring at these smug faces in the room…

52:10.797 --> 52:13.467
if she was here telling you…

52:15.177 --> 52:17.888
that every drop of her blood…

52:19.723 --> 52:21.975
was against signing these papers…

52:24.770 --> 52:26.355
what would you say?

52:27.481 --> 52:30.234
What's going on? Speak Japanese!

52:33.946 --> 52:35.739
Would you still tell her to sign?

53:17.281 --> 53:18.323
Don't do it.

53:21.910 --> 53:23.370
That's what I would tell her.

53:25.038 --> 53:26.331
Don't sign.

53:37.176 --> 53:38.343
What's going on?

53:38.427 --> 53:39.428
I can't hear the music.

54:09.541 --> 54:11.084
What is going on here?

54:12.336 --> 54:13.420
What's happening?

54:14.713 --> 54:15.964
Where's she going, Solomon?

54:16.048 --> 54:19.134
The signing was just protocol.

54:19.218 --> 54:21.220
- What just happened?
- Goddamn it.

54:21.303 --> 54:23.722
She already agreed to the contract!

55:11.645 --> 55:13.480
What the fuck was that, Solomon?

55:14.398 --> 55:15.440
What did you say to her?

55:19.611 --> 55:20.988
Now you're not gonna talk to me?

55:21.071 --> 55:23.615
Why couldn't you shut up ten minutes ago,
Solomon?

55:24.825 --> 55:25.868
That was so fucked.

55:25.951 --> 55:27.619
Fuck you, "defy gravity".

55:27.703 --> 55:29.746
Three year-- Three fucking years, man.

55:31.957 --> 55:35.210
- Jesus Christ-- Yeah, yeah.
- I warned everyone of this.

55:35.294 --> 55:37.880
To bring someone like him into this…

55:38.547 --> 55:40.632
It was reckless. Worse, it was dangerous.

55:40.716 --> 55:43.760
He should never have been trusted!
He made a fool of us!

55:54.730 --> 55:56.398
You fucked me, Solomon Baek.

56:01.695 --> 56:03.197
Fucking embarrassment.

57:35.330 --> 57:36.582
Stop here.

57:37.749 --> 57:39.835
But we're not at the hotel.

57:40.419 --> 57:41.628
Mother!
