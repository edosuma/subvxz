WEBVTT

00:06.111 --> 00:07.577
Dad, I need your opinion on this.

00:07.679 --> 00:08.812
I finally figured out

00:08.881 --> 00:10.592
why there are only three people
in Font Club.

00:10.616 --> 00:11.915
Because it's Font Club?

00:11.984 --> 00:14.484
Exactly... It's a "Club,"
not an "Activity."

00:14.586 --> 00:15.986
But I petitioned the school

00:16.088 --> 00:17.587
to grant Font Club "Activity" status,

00:17.689 --> 00:19.422
so now kids can get
community-service credit

00:19.491 --> 00:20.690
if they join.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.679
Now, let me walk you through
the different fonts.

00:22.728 --> 00:24.561
I suggest you close your eyes
between each one

00:24.663 --> 00:26.316
as a palate cleanser.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.934
How 'bout I close my eyes
for all of 'em?

00:27.958 --> 00:29.324
Now, the first font in contention

00:29.426 --> 00:31.226
is Caviar Dreams...

00:31.328 --> 00:32.928
clean, modern...

00:34.431 --> 00:36.509
See, normally,
Mike would jump at the chance

00:36.533 --> 00:39.601
to escape Brick's droning
with a phone call.

00:39.703 --> 00:41.136
But this call was from Sue,

00:41.205 --> 00:43.905
who lately kept calling him
wanting to chat.

00:43.941 --> 00:47.542
And the only thing Mike hated
more than droning was chatting.

00:47.611 --> 00:52.302
Suddenly, I realized I was
wearing two different socks.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.109
So, what's new with you?

00:55.178 --> 00:57.445
Same.

00:57.514 --> 01:00.081
And then I just think
"Where do I fit in this world?"

01:00.149 --> 01:02.149
'Cause some days,
I feel like I'm special,

01:02.217 --> 01:04.650
but then I think, "Who am I to
even think that I'm special?"

01:04.753 --> 01:06.520
Doesn't everyone think they're special?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.522
- Do you thinkyou're special?
- Nope.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.024
Flamenco is a font top-five for me.

01:11.093 --> 01:12.526
It's a bit randy, and I don't want

01:12.594 --> 01:14.294
to promise anything I can't deliver.

01:14.330 --> 01:17.160
I need to talk to you
about my ovaries. - Uh...

01:17.262 --> 01:19.093
I'm going back in for more fonts.

01:20.887 --> 01:22.153
I have to go in tomorrow.

01:22.188 --> 01:24.148
The doctor wants me to do
an ultrasound, remember?

01:24.190 --> 01:25.223
Yeah, I remember.

01:25.325 --> 01:27.258
- You don't remember.
- Yeah, I don't remember.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.428
You know, I find talking to you
less and less enjoyable.

01:30.530 --> 01:32.864
Tell Sue... Why does she
keep calling me?

01:32.966 --> 01:34.332
She doesn't have anything to say.

01:34.434 --> 01:36.200
She just wants to chat,
and I hate chatting.

01:36.302 --> 01:37.869
Well, she's not dating anyone right now.

01:37.937 --> 01:40.304
You're kind of her boyfriend substitute.

01:41.741 --> 01:43.461
Let's go back to talking
about your ovaries.

01:47.547 --> 01:48.980
Turns out, given the choice

01:49.082 --> 01:52.083
between feeding old people
and meeting at Font Club,

01:52.185 --> 01:53.785
Font Club gave you the most bang

01:53.887 --> 01:56.154
for your community-service buck.

01:56.256 --> 01:57.288
Hello, all.

01:57.390 --> 01:58.790
Welcome to Font Club.

01:58.892 --> 02:00.825
So, I thought it'd be a nice icebreaker

02:00.894 --> 02:04.157
to go around and have everybody
say their favorite font.

02:04.864 --> 02:05.763
Yeah.

02:05.865 --> 02:07.632
Can you sign my community service?

02:07.701 --> 02:09.901
Okay, I know some of you are just here

02:10.002 --> 02:13.104
for community-service credit,
but if you'll give me a chance,

02:13.206 --> 02:15.940
I'll show you fonts
can change your life.

02:16.009 --> 02:18.776
You know what'd change my life?
If you gave us all pillows.

02:18.878 --> 02:20.198
'Cause you're putting me to sleep.

02:21.548 --> 02:22.980
Oh, that's funny?

02:23.049 --> 02:24.682
Well, let's see how funny it is

02:24.751 --> 02:26.471
when you write a letter
to the girl you love

02:26.553 --> 02:28.419
and you need to choose between Windsong

02:28.521 --> 02:29.687
and Herr von Muellerhoff,

02:29.789 --> 02:31.656
and you choose wrong
and lose her forever.

02:31.725 --> 02:33.491
Well, I wouldn't choose either of those.

02:33.593 --> 02:37.028
I'd go with Pinyon Script,
and I think you know why.

02:38.565 --> 02:40.465
I do!

02:42.402 --> 02:44.268
Who gave you a key?

02:44.370 --> 02:46.170
I had one made.
You can pay me back later.

02:46.272 --> 02:48.573
I brought someone here to see you.

02:48.675 --> 02:50.575
Hey, there, Suzy Q.

02:50.677 --> 02:52.610
Oh, Sean! Aah!

02:52.712 --> 02:54.078
What are you doing here?

02:54.180 --> 02:56.748
Well, I had an interview
at IU for med school.

02:56.850 --> 02:59.183
I just thought I'd drop in
and see my favorite Hecks.

02:59.285 --> 03:01.352
Don't tell the rest
of your family I said that.

03:01.454 --> 03:03.321
- I love all you guys.
- Aww.

03:03.423 --> 03:05.301
Well, sounds like you two
have a lot to catch up on.

03:05.325 --> 03:07.058
I'm gonna use your steam shower.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.437
Do you have that conditioner
I asked for?

03:08.461 --> 03:09.660
I can't use what you'll use,

03:09.729 --> 03:12.563
'cause I don't want my hair
to look like... that.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.200
Toast me a bagel in seven minutes.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.984
Well, I'm fine.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.285
You sound great.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.087
No, I am.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.789
My ovaries are fine.

03:27.891 --> 03:30.825
Unfortunately, they're like raisins.

03:30.927 --> 03:33.395
And not the cute, plump California ones

03:33.497 --> 03:35.230
that dance and wear gloves.

03:35.332 --> 03:39.067
They're like the hard,
shriveled, sad, deformed ones

03:39.169 --> 03:41.670
in the Raisin Flakes we get
from the Frugal Hoosier.

03:41.772 --> 03:43.338
Well, this can't be a shock, Frankie.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.440
- I mean, you are 50...
- I know what I am, thanks.

03:45.509 --> 03:46.786
You don't get it.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.610
Because they don't
shut men's factories downs.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.779
They only shut women's factories down.

03:50.881 --> 03:51.613
What factories?

03:51.682 --> 03:53.014
This factory.

03:53.116 --> 03:54.683
I mean, I liked knowing it was open.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.317
Now it's all red-tagged and padlocked

03:56.420 --> 03:58.887
with bulldozers in the parking lot.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.557
I feel like anything I say here
is gonna be wrong,

04:02.626 --> 04:06.895
so... you want to just hug me?

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.205 --> 04:17.639
Shut your eyes, Frankie.
I got a surprise for you.

04:17.741 --> 04:21.202
Hey, baby. I got you a baby.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.571
I don't understand.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.906
Nothing to understand... got you a baby.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.441
What do you mean, you got me a baby?

04:27.510 --> 04:29.977
It's Dierdre's.
She's letting us borrow it.

04:30.079 --> 04:31.456
I forgot to ask
whether it's a boy or a girl,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.113
but I figure we'll find out eventually.

04:33.182 --> 04:35.783
What? Why are we watching it?

04:35.885 --> 04:37.095
Well, she was supposed to go out,

04:37.119 --> 04:39.853
but her mom had some fake dizzy spell,

04:39.956 --> 04:41.965
but she was all dressed up,
so I felt bad.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.190
She was wearing clunky jewelry.

04:43.224 --> 04:44.635
I don't know what that is,
but she made it seem

04:44.659 --> 04:46.779
- like it's a big deal.
- And you just offered to babysit?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.828
- Why do you sound angry?
- Because I am angry!

04:48.930 --> 04:49.941
You said you wanted a baby.

04:49.965 --> 04:51.464
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.533
You were upset about your
dried-out ovaries,

04:53.602 --> 04:55.568
and you wished you could
have a baby, so...

04:55.604 --> 04:57.003
got you a baby!

04:57.105 --> 04:59.138
I wished I could still have
a baby if I wanted to,

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
but I don't want to.

05:00.308 --> 05:01.374
Take that baby back.

05:01.443 --> 05:03.009
I can't take the baby back.

05:03.111 --> 05:04.711
I promised Dierdre we'd watch it.

05:04.813 --> 05:06.279
Damn it! I had plans tonight.

05:06.381 --> 05:08.982
I was gonna watch "Outlander"
and eat my frosting sandwich.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.517
And have you forgotten
how much work babies are, huh...

05:11.620 --> 05:13.186
all the crying and feeding them

05:13.288 --> 05:14.650
and diapering them?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.847
I spent my entire 30s

05:15.949 --> 05:17.327
with my hands smelling like butt cream.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.262
I would eat a cookie and think,
"What's that weird smell?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.919
Oh, yeah, butt cream."

05:20.988 --> 05:22.632
Doo-dee, doo-dee, doo-dee, doo.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.357
Fine. When are they getting home?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.192
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?!

05:27.294 --> 05:28.994
Her husband got her Brad Paisley tickets

05:29.096 --> 05:30.096
for their anniversary.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.363
Now, that's a good present.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.661
And then I think
"Where do I fit in this world?"

05:41.716 --> 05:43.816
'Cause some days I feel
like I'm special,

05:43.885 --> 05:46.819
but then I think, "Who am I to
even think that I'm special?"

05:46.888 --> 05:49.388
- You know? Do you feel special?
- Hmm.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.425
You know, in my anatomy class,
we read about this new study,

05:52.527 --> 05:53.859
and even in identical twins

05:53.928 --> 05:56.362
where all the genes are
supposed to be exactly alike,

05:56.464 --> 05:58.764
there's this "X" factor
that makes them different.

05:58.866 --> 05:59.983
It's like snowflakes...

06:00.008 --> 06:01.754
no two people are exactly the same.

06:01.822 --> 06:04.586
But even if I never read that,
I'd know that you, Suzy Q,

06:04.654 --> 06:06.539
are a very special snowflake.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.885
You know, it is so great to hear things

06:09.987 --> 06:11.220
from a guy's perspective.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.455
My dad isn't much of a talker, you know?

06:13.524 --> 06:15.624
And Axl isn't always very sensitive.

06:25.169 --> 06:27.569
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:27.671 --> 06:29.204
Hi!

06:29.273 --> 06:31.740
Oh, sorry. Uh... Lexie,
this is Sean Donahue.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.542
Sean, this is my roommate Lexie.

06:33.611 --> 06:35.974
Donahue... Wait. I know that name.

06:36.043 --> 06:38.305
Your mom sends Sue those care packages.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.407
Tell her her scones are amazing.

06:40.475 --> 06:42.115
Yeah, yeah, she'll tell you
it's the love,

06:42.210 --> 06:43.488
but it's really
the five pounds of butter.

06:44.646 --> 06:45.912
Is my right hand bleeding,

06:46.014 --> 06:47.926
'cause it feels like blood,
but I can't really see.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.684
You know, uh, Axl and I were
gonna go grab some food later.

06:50.752 --> 06:51.785
You should come.

06:51.887 --> 06:53.386
I mean, you should both come.

06:53.488 --> 06:55.589
Oh. Sounds great.

07:03.565 --> 07:06.399
Come on, baby, look at the keys!

07:06.468 --> 07:08.234
Look at the keys!

07:08.303 --> 07:09.736
Look at the keys.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.851
Well, we got a great turnout
at Font Club.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.375
Unfortunately, most of the kids

07:16.444 --> 07:17.810
are just in it for the credit.

07:17.845 --> 07:19.945
But there is this one guy, Gibson.

07:20.047 --> 07:21.413
He's a savant.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.482
He's a font savant. He's a safont!

07:23.551 --> 07:25.851
Brick, you're on your own
for dinner tonight.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.453
I just got to raise my game.

07:27.555 --> 07:29.321
I got too relaxed...

07:29.390 --> 07:31.490
You know, a little sloppy,
a little lazy.

07:31.592 --> 07:32.791
So this is good.

07:32.893 --> 07:34.793
It's like when
a new sports star comes in

07:34.862 --> 07:37.509
and forces the established
sports star to up his sport.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.715
That's right!
That's what I'm talking about.

07:41.319 --> 07:42.930
I'm gonna check out
the new font websites,

07:42.954 --> 07:44.887
see what the kids are using these days.

07:44.956 --> 07:46.355
Who's the bald guy?

07:46.457 --> 07:47.890
It's the neighbors' baby.

07:47.992 --> 07:49.325
Ah.

07:49.394 --> 07:51.634
I knew it wasn't yours, 'cause
of your shriveled ovaries.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.729
The walls are very thin here, Mom.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.967
Look at you.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.369
Can't believe you've already
been married and divorced.

08:00.471 --> 08:02.004
Now you're dating your ex-wife?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.406
You're such a playa.

08:03.474 --> 08:06.275
Well, yeah, I'm a playa.
Or it's just weird.

08:06.377 --> 08:07.377
I don't know.

08:07.412 --> 08:08.744
Yeah, how exactly does that work?

08:08.846 --> 08:10.424
I don't know.
We see each other when we can.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.615
There's no real rules.
I don't know what I'm doing.

08:12.717 --> 08:14.016
Well, as long as you're happy.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.951
Yeah, that's why we got divorced.

08:16.054 --> 08:17.253
We were happy.

08:17.355 --> 08:18.666
So, listen, uh... why didn't you tell me

08:18.690 --> 08:20.122
Sue had such a hot roommate?

08:20.224 --> 08:22.002
I would've come down a lot sooner.

08:22.026 --> 08:23.726
Oh. I, uh...

08:30.601 --> 08:32.702
I heard they have great onion rings.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.327
Brick decided he needed to study fonts

08:39.352 --> 08:42.020
in their purest form...
on the written page.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.980
So he went to buy some paper.

08:44.015 --> 08:48.451
And, for no apparent reason,
a Flip Wilson DVD.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.821
Gibson.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.656
Funny seeing you in aisle F,

09:18.725 --> 09:20.892
which is in the Bookman Old Style font.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.234
- Not surprised to see you here.
- Mm.

09:23.270 --> 09:24.696
Looking for something
to put on that burn

09:24.764 --> 09:27.050
I laid on you this afternoon?

09:27.767 --> 09:30.694
No one walks into my Font Club
and shows me up.

09:30.796 --> 09:32.368
Looks like someone just did.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.207
There's not room enough
in Font Club for the both of us.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.368
So let's settle this like men.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.787
We pull boxes of the same
feminine-hygiene product

09:40.856 --> 09:42.021
and call the font on the back.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.423
I win...

09:43.525 --> 09:44.991
you're out of the club.

09:50.332 --> 09:51.598
- Open Sans!
- Open Sans!

09:58.140 --> 10:00.006
- Graviola Soft!
- Graviola Soft!

10:06.782 --> 10:09.400
Guilder Free Italic.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.797
...so I hope with five interviews

10:23.899 --> 10:24.839
at different med schools,

10:24.916 --> 10:26.126
at least one of them will like me.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.316
With that smile?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.430
I'm willing to bet at least
two of them will like you.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.587
Well, while you're
interviewing for schools,

10:31.689 --> 10:33.489
I'll be interviewing for actual jobs

10:33.591 --> 10:34.969
where they give me money.

10:34.993 --> 10:36.470
Good, you're gonna need it
to pay my bill

10:36.494 --> 10:37.593
when I'm your doctor.

10:37.662 --> 10:39.073
Well, you're gonna need to pay my bill

10:39.097 --> 10:40.830
when I'm your businessman.

10:41.966 --> 10:43.666
So, I've been sitting here
this whole time

10:43.735 --> 10:46.202
just looking at you and thinking
you look like someone,

10:46.271 --> 10:49.071
and now I know who... Snow White.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.427
You've been staring at me
this whole dinner,

10:51.451 --> 10:52.728
and the best you can come up with

10:52.752 --> 10:54.318
is a cartoon character?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.953
A very pretty cartoon character.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.688
I was Belle for Halloween once!

11:01.127 --> 11:03.728
Oops! You dropped your fork.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.599
So, Sean? Are you guys like...?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.001
What?! No!

11:10.103 --> 11:11.535
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.304
He's like an older brother to me.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.872
So you wouldn't mind if I...?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.273
Pbht!

11:16.342 --> 11:17.441
Sorry. I spit on you.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.210
That is how strongly I wouldn't mind.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.545
Of course not. You go for it, girl.

11:23.783 --> 11:27.151
Look at this.
My breadstick is a moustache.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.486
Right?

11:28.554 --> 11:32.585
So, Sean, which out of the five
schools is your favorite?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.125
Uh, well, I love Duke.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.693
They've got a great Med-Peds program,

11:35.728 --> 11:37.128
and they have killer architecture.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.698
Uh, sorry, I don't believe that
they have the Gumford Gazebo.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.100
It was built by Ezekiel Gumford in 1882.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.002
And after the big flood,
they rebuilt it,

11:45.038 --> 11:47.672
and now it's half-plastic.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.408
Wow, that could really tip the scales.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.642
I'll have to check that out.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.030
Oh, well, I'm done.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.238
Let's go.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.807
I give tours
to prospective students, so...

11:57.909 --> 11:59.029
Or you can just go yourself.

11:59.077 --> 12:00.143
Okay.

12:03.982 --> 12:05.448
Is it me, or was that weird?

12:05.550 --> 12:06.916
Yes.

12:06.985 --> 12:09.786
I mean, I love that Sean
and Lexie went off together,

12:09.855 --> 12:12.255
- 'cause they're both great.
- Yeah, they're awesome.

12:12.324 --> 12:14.202
And it's cool that Lexie
was being so nice to Sean,

12:14.226 --> 12:16.571
'cause he's got that squeaky-clean,
successful med-school-student thing

12:16.595 --> 12:18.762
that most girls are not that into.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.430
I just hope he wasn't put off by her,

12:20.499 --> 12:23.066
'cause she was so obvious.

12:23.135 --> 12:24.535
You order a salad in front of a guy,

12:24.603 --> 12:27.740
it's like, "Hello! Please marry me."

12:27.789 --> 12:29.723
Uh, Sean was the obvious one.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.125
"You're so pretty.
You look like Snow White." Lame.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.128
What about Lexie, showing off
her Ezekiel Gumford knowledge?

12:35.230 --> 12:37.664
I just thought Sean had game,
but if that's his game,

12:37.766 --> 12:38.766
then damn.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.667
But, hey, if Lexie liked it, then great.

12:40.736 --> 12:42.302
That's great. They're both great.

12:42.404 --> 12:44.215
And if they were a couple,
they'd be twice as great.

12:44.239 --> 12:45.239
Oh, duh!

12:45.307 --> 12:46.706
My best friend and my neighbor

12:46.808 --> 12:48.586
who's like a brother to me...
and nothing more...

12:48.610 --> 12:49.610
end up together?

12:49.711 --> 12:51.077
What could be better than that?

12:51.146 --> 12:52.546
I actually now hope it happens.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.047
I'm gonna pray on it tonight.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.625
Do you weirdly feel like you want to eat

12:56.693 --> 12:57.959
a lot of ice cream right now?

12:58.061 --> 13:00.095
- I weirdly do.
- Yeah.

13:01.798 --> 13:04.666
Oh, it's okay, little angel.

13:04.768 --> 13:07.102
It's okay.

13:07.170 --> 13:08.637
Let me try.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.374
Oh, I know.

13:12.476 --> 13:18.213
♪ Indiana, our Indiana,
Indiana, we're all for you ♪

13:18.315 --> 13:22.817
♪ We will fight for Indiana
and the glory of old IU ♪

13:22.920 --> 13:24.319
♪ IU! ♪

13:29.726 --> 13:31.626
Look at that. I love that...

13:32.103 --> 13:33.703
when they smile in their sleep,

13:33.805 --> 13:36.372
dreaming their little baby dreams.

13:36.894 --> 13:38.093
Oh, my God.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.367
You didn't get this baby for me.

13:40.469 --> 13:41.702
You got it for you.

13:41.771 --> 13:44.015
What? No. I got it for you.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.578
You just sniffed its head.
You got it for you.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.042
Oh, okay. So what if I did?

13:48.110 --> 13:49.143
I don't know.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.278
I was just thinking,
the kids are growing up.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.646
And Sue's been calling me,

13:52.715 --> 13:54.035
but today, she didn't call at all.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.516
I thought you hate to chat.

13:55.618 --> 13:56.450
Yeah.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.698
I'm glad you're a girl. I wanted a girl.

14:02.225 --> 14:05.726
Uh-huh. I'm just gonna ease her down.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.509
Wow. You're still up.

14:30.611 --> 14:31.910
Well, yeah.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.211
So, how was it?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.320
What'd you do? How'd it go?

14:34.348 --> 14:35.547
Great.

14:35.616 --> 14:39.127
We walked around campus,
then we got coffee.

14:39.152 --> 14:41.266
- Mm!
- He's kind of perfect.

14:41.335 --> 14:43.673
Ahh! I'm so happy!

14:43.742 --> 14:45.157
Look how happy I am!

14:46.010 --> 14:48.977
It's just he's a lot like
every other guy I've dated.

14:49.046 --> 14:51.847
And I don't know if that's
what I want right now.

14:51.949 --> 14:54.950
Oh! Ohh. Ohh, yeah.

14:55.052 --> 14:56.985
Oh, okay. Well, sure. Ohh.

14:57.054 --> 14:59.688
I feel like I'm at a point
where I need to date a bad boy.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.658
Oh, yeah, I totally get that...

15:02.726 --> 15:04.293
like someone who drives with one hand.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.594
I just want to be with a guy

15:05.663 --> 15:08.023
who doesn't have his life all
figured out already, you know?

15:08.065 --> 15:09.494
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.006
Hey, Doctor. How'd it go?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.288
Did you write her
a prescription for love?

15:16.357 --> 15:19.725
Man, she's beautiful and smart.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.461
I get it. She's smart.
She's a smart girl.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.197
But when did we as a society
decide that that was important?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.399
It's just that...

15:26.434 --> 15:27.878
I don't know, about halfway
through the night,

15:27.902 --> 15:29.113
I started thinking, "What am I doing?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.436
I'm going to med school.

15:30.505 --> 15:32.671
I can't get involved with anybody now."

15:32.774 --> 15:34.140
Oh, that's too bad.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.042
You guys would have been great together.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.677
That sucks, man.

15:38.746 --> 15:41.080
You guys would have been
great together. Aw.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.349
Do you feel like ice cream?
I feel like ice cream.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.120
Um... I think we might be out.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.123
Oh, my gosh.

15:51.192 --> 15:53.138
Do you know where we are?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.835
Hell?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.071
We just drove past the doll hospital,

15:58.140 --> 16:00.173
and you're about to turn on Applewood.

16:00.242 --> 16:03.110
Ah, it's "the route."

16:03.178 --> 16:04.711
How many times did we take this drive

16:04.813 --> 16:06.893
to get the kids to stop crying
when they were babies?

16:06.982 --> 16:08.193
Must've been a lot, 'cause my body

16:08.217 --> 16:09.616
just drove us here automatically.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.785
Axl was the worst, remember?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.487
- Mm.
- Ugh!

16:13.555 --> 16:15.956
We had to drive with him for hours...

16:16.024 --> 16:19.025
and listen to that "Sesame Street"
cassette over and over.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.203
But we had to skip
that song with the Count.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.272
Oh, yes! He was terrified of the Count!

16:23.340 --> 16:24.540
Aww!

16:24.642 --> 16:27.042
I always liked Oscar.
The guy just liked trash...

16:27.111 --> 16:29.122
- - ...and didn't
want other people messing it.

16:29.146 --> 16:30.946
Why's that make him a grouch?

16:33.384 --> 16:34.384
Listen.

16:34.485 --> 16:35.918
She stopped.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.553
Hmm?

16:37.621 --> 16:38.887
Well, not for long.

16:38.989 --> 16:41.191
We're about to hit that
bump on Northaven.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.758
Ohh.

16:44.987 --> 16:46.462
Huh.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.263
Yeah, they must have paved it.

16:48.365 --> 16:49.798
Hmm.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.420
They paved the bump.

16:55.523 --> 16:58.223
Come on.

16:58.292 --> 17:00.826
We just got that one to stop crying.

17:00.861 --> 17:04.695
It's just one minute, you're
driving around with your kids,

17:04.765 --> 17:08.461
listening to Elmo sing
"I Don't Want To Live On The Moon,"

17:08.486 --> 17:10.386
and the next minute,
your doctor's telling you

17:10.454 --> 17:12.320
he can't find your ovaries.

17:12.424 --> 17:14.656
And it was all just funny to him,

17:14.759 --> 17:16.559
but it's not funny.

17:16.661 --> 17:20.530
That moment should be
marked in some way.

17:20.632 --> 17:22.397
No, I mean it.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.778
I mean, everybody makes a big deal

17:23.801 --> 17:25.601
when you get married and have a baby,

17:25.637 --> 17:28.771
but nobody's having a ceremony
for your shriveled ovaries.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.961
- You know what I mean?
- Like when a player retires,

17:30.985 --> 17:32.422
and they hoist his jersey
into the rafters.

17:32.477 --> 17:34.610
Yes! Exactly.

17:34.712 --> 17:35.912
They just...

17:36.722 --> 17:38.989
They deserve more respect.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.657
You know?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.693
I mean, they may not have been
the flashiest ovaries,

17:43.762 --> 17:45.529
but they got the job done.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.130
Hey, they gave us three great kids.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.666
Well, at any given time,

17:49.768 --> 17:51.246
two of the three of them were great...

17:51.270 --> 17:52.569
or at least good.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.037
Hey, no one's in jail.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.839
They deserve something,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.408
some sort of send-off
for all their years of service.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.644
They deserve more of an ending.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.846
They deserve...

18:03.316 --> 18:05.148
a goodbye.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.925
They had a good run.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.517
I think Ernie sang
"I Don't Want To Live On The Moon."

18:21.601 --> 18:23.000
No.

18:23.102 --> 18:23.935
Ernie? Was it Ernie?

18:24.003 --> 18:25.470
- I think it was.
- What'd I say?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.505
- Elmo.
- Elmo.

18:27.574 --> 18:31.409
Yep, there's nothing like a car
ride to put a baby to sleep.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.178
And it works pretty well
on old people, too.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.182
Uh, hello?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.151
Oh, hi. Yeah.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.989
We were just all going out
for a pancake breakfast.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.891
It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.626
Sorry.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.694
It's been a while since we did this.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.555
You know what? I don't even care.

18:53.624 --> 18:54.890
I had the best night of my life.

18:54.992 --> 18:57.826
Brad Paisley did three encores,
I had six margaritas,

18:57.895 --> 18:59.339
Steve and I made out in the parking lot,

18:59.363 --> 19:00.262
and I threw up on the hood.

19:00.331 --> 19:01.813
I felt 32 again!

19:01.838 --> 19:04.072
Thank you, really.

19:04.195 --> 19:05.761
Thank you.

19:14.378 --> 19:16.378
All right.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.781
I got to go get the other ones.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.483
Aww.

19:21.585 --> 19:24.920
She has four little kids.

19:25.022 --> 19:26.622
You know what she doesn't have?

19:26.690 --> 19:29.091
Time for pancakes.

19:29.193 --> 19:31.059
Yes.

19:36.801 --> 19:37.666
Hi, honey.

19:37.768 --> 19:39.101
Hey, Dad. Is this a bad time?

19:39.203 --> 19:42.604
No. Matter of fact, it's a good time.

19:42.706 --> 19:44.740
Well, I've been thinking.

19:44.842 --> 19:47.176
I think I need to put myself
out there a little more.

19:47.278 --> 19:49.611
Like, I don't know, there's
this one guy that I like,

19:49.713 --> 19:51.947
but I think he might
just see me as a friend.

19:52.049 --> 19:53.949
Well, I don't know if you need boys

19:54.051 --> 19:56.185
to be anything more
than friends... ever.

19:56.287 --> 19:58.020
Ha ha.

19:58.122 --> 20:01.723
Anyway, he drives this
safety cart around school,

20:01.826 --> 20:04.493
and he's super nice.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.428
Okay, well, I like safety.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.163
Safety cart sound good.

20:08.265 --> 20:09.965
Yeah. I know. Me, too.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.266
And if you come...

20:21.053 --> 20:24.321
I need to make an announcement,
and I'd like you by my side.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.056
It depends on what you say.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.891
I knew I could count on you.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.632
I have a brief statement...

20:35.701 --> 20:37.601
...and then I'll take questions.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.603
It's been an amazing nine weeks,

20:39.705 --> 20:42.806
but it's with a heavy heart
that I must step down.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.876
I have found another
more worthy of the mantle.

20:45.978 --> 20:50.914
And so, I leave Font Club
in the hands of Gibson...

20:51.016 --> 20:53.483
something, or something Gibson.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.219
I don't know if that's his first
or last name.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.888
God bless you all.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.956
And God bless Font Club.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.158
I will now take questions.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.261
Do we still get credit?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.961
No more questions.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.564
Wait.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.199
I can't be president.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.908
I don't even go here.
I'm in eighth grade.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.035
The only reason I'm here

21:12.137 --> 21:13.681
is 'cause my mom's the computer teacher,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.516
and she makes me walk over
from the middle school

21:15.540 --> 21:16.706
so she can drive me home.

21:20.821 --> 21:21.853
Never mind.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.082
Come on, get in the car...
Family breakfast.

21:39.106 --> 21:41.217
Mom, I have to practice
my squat jumps for volleyball.

21:41.241 --> 21:43.875
Your what? Oh, good Lord.

21:43.978 --> 21:45.310
If I did that,

21:45.412 --> 21:46.790
Anna-Kat wouldn't wouldn't be
the only one peeing in the yard.

21:46.814 --> 21:48.614
Get in the car.

21:48.649 --> 21:50.616
Oh, and we have to stop by Office Depot.

21:50.718 --> 21:52.896
I need to make some posters for
the school's recycling drive...

21:52.920 --> 21:55.520
chairman. You can start by recycling

21:55.623 --> 21:58.557
that stupid blue bag
from The New York Times

21:58.592 --> 22:00.325
that you leave next to
the toilet every day.

22:00.394 --> 22:02.594
Do I have to go? Yes!

22:02.663 --> 22:06.198
I want a fun family outing.
Now get in the car.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.567
Mom, we talked about the sweat pants...

22:08.669 --> 22:10.569
Westporters get dressed
to go out in public.

22:10.671 --> 22:11.671
We're not Westporters.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.405
We are renters who live in Westport.

22:13.474 --> 22:15.941
It is a small distinction,
but I cling to it.

22:16.010 --> 22:19.378
Now, get in the car.

22:21.148 --> 22:23.382
Mama, I found this on the windshield.

22:23.484 --> 22:25.617
A "concerned" neighbor thinks

22:25.719 --> 22:27.753
we should get the dent
in our minivan fixed.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.222
It's sullying the neighborhood.

22:30.324 --> 22:32.057
And look at that... unsigned.

22:32.159 --> 22:35.861
There's something very wrong
with this place.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.664
Coward!

22:38.766 --> 22:41.800
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by VITAC</font>...

22:49.610 --> 22:52.044
Anna-Kat, the weird-versus-cute ratio

22:52.146 --> 22:54.079
is getting way out of whack.

22:54.181 --> 22:55.291
Don't talk to your sister like that.

22:55.315 --> 22:56.815
She's always embarrassing me.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.017
You should see how she walks
down the hall at school.

23:03.157 --> 23:06.224
Hey, isn't that your sister?

23:06.326 --> 23:10.829
Yeah. She's feral.
We found her in the woods.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.498
I don't care if she's setting
the teachers' lounge on fire.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.001
You're her brother,
and you need to have her back.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.502
 Just in case...

23:17.571 --> 23:20.405
I actually do care if you set
the teachers' lounge on fire.

23:20.507 --> 23:22.507
Mnh-mnh! No cellphones.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.609
I have rights.

23:23.677 --> 23:25.510
Isn't that cute?

23:25.612 --> 23:26.678
No, you don't.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.581
Whoever told you that
is not helping you.

23:29.683 --> 23:30.849
I am in charge,

23:30.951 --> 23:33.018
and we are going to have
a low-tech family breakfast

23:33.120 --> 23:34.653
like we used to do back home.

23:34.755 --> 23:36.332
Westport is our home.
We're not visiting.

23:36.356 --> 23:38.868
You know, I saw on Facebook that
everyone from our old cul-de-sac

23:38.892 --> 23:40.403
got together
for the annual kickball game.

23:40.427 --> 23:43.395
Carl made that punch in a trash
can that he always brings.

23:43.497 --> 23:44.196
What's that stuff called?

23:44.298 --> 23:45.163
Trash Can Punch.

23:45.265 --> 23:46.465
Yeah, that makes sense.

23:46.567 --> 23:48.600
They didn't even think to invite us.

23:48.669 --> 23:50.069
Because we don't live there anymore.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.337
We still kind of live there.

23:52.439 --> 23:55.140
In no way, shape, or form
do we live there.

23:55.242 --> 23:57.743
That's why I said "kind of."

23:57.845 --> 23:59.111
I'm bored.

23:59.213 --> 24:01.780
Okay, let's play a family game.
I Spy. Who wants to go first?

24:01.882 --> 24:03.248
I'd love to go first.

24:03.350 --> 24:04.583
Oh!

24:04.685 --> 24:08.019
I spy Alice coming in,
and I spy you in sweat pants,

24:08.122 --> 24:11.156
so I spy me going over to her.

24:11.225 --> 24:13.558
It's "I spy with my little eye"!

24:13.660 --> 24:20.031
Oh! I spy with my little eye the
girls from the volleyball team.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.234
I Spy is really
bringing this family together.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.102
Why don't they want to eat with us?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.849
You should be happy
they're making friends.

24:25.873 --> 24:27.706
Yeah, Westport friends.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.908
Look at them...
They're probably talking about

24:29.977 --> 24:32.077
their Christmas vacation
in Turks and Caicos.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.447
I am angry that I even know
what Turks and Caicos is now.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.282
And look at Taylor and her friends...

24:37.351 --> 24:39.351
They are splitting a muffin
four ways. Why?

24:39.419 --> 24:42.320
Because this town muffin shames
women, and it starts early.

24:42.422 --> 24:44.623
I just wanted to do something
as a family,

24:44.725 --> 24:46.758
and this town is getting in our way.

24:49.163 --> 24:50.495
Can I have some cream?

24:50.564 --> 24:52.631
Soy, almond, cashew, or lactose-free?

24:52.733 --> 24:54.166
Mnh-mnh. Half-and-half.

24:54.268 --> 24:55.767
Half almond, half soy?

24:55.836 --> 24:58.103
No. Half milk, half fatter milk.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.472
Oh, I'm sorry.
We stopped carrying cream.

25:00.574 --> 25:03.542
Nobody wants it, because
it's very unhealthy for you.

25:03.610 --> 25:06.111
No... This was not the day to say that.

25:06.180 --> 25:09.281
I want cream and other normal stuff.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.183
I object to gluten-free pancakes,

25:11.285 --> 25:13.185
turkey bacon, and almond soy milk!

25:13.253 --> 25:14.452
I want real milk.

25:14.521 --> 25:17.889
Why can't any of you in this
town be normal and regular?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.424
And why can't any of you

25:19.526 --> 25:23.128
drink cocktails out of a trash
can like the rest of America?!

25:23.197 --> 25:24.863
Huh?!

25:31.205 --> 25:32.982
This might be why they don't
want to eat with us.

25:35.809 --> 25:38.944
Well, that about wraps up the
popular phase of our childhood.

25:39.012 --> 25:40.912
The cream was my last straw.

25:40.981 --> 25:42.948
Now I get why Fat Pam moved away.

25:43.050 --> 25:44.349
I wonder what her last straw was.

25:44.451 --> 25:46.651
Maybe she got her arm stuck
in one of those tiny blouses

25:46.720 --> 25:48.832
that they sell on Main Street
and couldn't get it out.

25:48.856 --> 25:50.867
Then the seam split,
she had to roll it up in a ball,

25:50.891 --> 25:51.891
hide it in her pants,

25:51.925 --> 25:53.369
and then throw it out
in the ladies' room.

25:53.393 --> 25:55.627
I'm worried about
how specific that example was.

25:55.696 --> 25:58.997
No bright-siding it...
We just don't fit in,

25:59.066 --> 26:01.933
and I haven't liked it
since the minute we got here.

26:10.410 --> 26:14.412
I love it! I have such
a good feeling about this!

26:14.514 --> 26:15.981
Hello!

26:16.083 --> 26:17.182
Hi! I'm Katie.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.018
Ah, nice to meet you.
This is my husband, Greg.
