[indistinct chatter]

01:37.725 --> 01:38.726
Come on!

01:40.728 --> 01:42.980
Go. Fuck!

01:57.495 --> 01:59.330
-Seriously?
-What you want me to do?

01:59.414 --> 02:01.166
It's like a fucking <i>carnaval</i> out there.

02:01.249 --> 02:03.293
That don't mean
we gotta behave like animals.

02:03.376 --> 02:05.336
You think animals got oral hygiene?

02:08.088 --> 02:09.757
I hate everybody.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.304
[Aleida] We ain't gonna
let this take us down.

02:14.387 --> 02:15.471
You hear me?

02:15.555 --> 02:19.642
-We're gonna fight it.
-Are you stupid?

02:19.725 --> 02:23.020
Kids that go into the system is like
flushin' a goldfish down the toilet.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.397
They don't swim back up.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.859
Well, I've had more than my share
of toilets reversing their shit and piss

02:28.943 --> 02:30.903
and dead goldfish
all over my bathroom floor.

02:30.986 --> 02:32.613
I got you back, didn't I?

02:32.697 --> 02:35.032
You got lucky once
because the caseworker died,

02:35.115 --> 02:38.161
and the temp spiked
her Big Gulp with vodka.

02:38.244 --> 02:41.414
But now, we don't know the caseworker.
We're in jail.

02:41.497 --> 02:42.998
How do you think this plays?

02:44.041 --> 02:45.751
You know, if fucking Bennett
wouldn't have lost his balls--

02:45.835 --> 02:47.253
This is your fault.

02:48.003 --> 02:49.755
You just had to, huh?

02:49.839 --> 02:53.384
Snatch my baby from a lady
that would've bought her organic,

02:53.468 --> 02:56.971
and piano lessons,
and toys made out of wood.

02:59.599 --> 03:02.310
Listen, Cesar's gonna get out,

03:02.393 --> 03:04.061
-and he's gonna fix this.
-[sighs]

03:05.104 --> 03:08.107
-He punched two cops.
-Please.

03:08.190 --> 03:12.278
I seen him beat a murder rap
where they found the gun in his pants.

03:12.362 --> 03:17.242
His sharky cousin, Duardo, got a Jew
who reps everyone in the game.

03:17.325 --> 03:20.202
Cesar will be back on the street
in like a week, I'm telling you.

03:21.287 --> 03:24.332
Cool. I guess I don't have
nothin' to worry about.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.709
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.296
I'm saying we still got cards.
We're alive.

03:33.216 --> 03:34.925
And don't kid yourself.

03:35.009 --> 03:38.221
Babies hate wood toys.
They don't make noise or nothing.

03:38.304 --> 03:39.972
That's some yuppie bullshit.

03:42.892 --> 03:43.893
[sighs]

03:43.976 --> 03:45.895
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

03:51.692 --> 03:54.111
-Morning.
-Dwight.

03:54.194 --> 03:56.196
I'm glad you're here.

03:56.281 --> 04:01.327
Turns out we, but mostly you,
have a very big problem.

04:01.411 --> 04:04.247
Oh, good gobsmackers,
I did it again last night, didn't I?

04:04.330 --> 04:08.459
If you mean your impression of a sack
of marbles being dumped in a dryer,

04:08.543 --> 04:10.670
then, yes, you did it.

04:10.753 --> 04:14.465
For six fucking hours straight.

04:14.549 --> 04:17.134
I am so sorry, Mrs. Reznikov.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.762
Ugh, this is so embarrassing.
It's my greatest affliction.

04:20.846 --> 04:24.642
Mmm, I'm gonna say you weren't
the afflicted one last night, no?

04:24.725 --> 04:26.311
You were asleep.

04:26.394 --> 04:28.604
I know, I know.
But you have no idea.

04:28.688 --> 04:30.273
I've tried everything.

04:30.356 --> 04:31.774
[sighs]

04:31.857 --> 04:34.109
Those sticky strips for your nose?

04:34.193 --> 04:37.322
Yes, but those don't work for me
because the problem isn't my nose.

04:37.405 --> 04:38.448
It's my uvula.

04:41.033 --> 04:43.243
I have an abnormally large uvula.

04:43.328 --> 04:44.954
Of course you do.

04:45.037 --> 04:46.163
[Piper] Larry snored.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.834
I used to stick books under the top
of his side of the mattress

04:49.917 --> 04:51.336
so his head would stay elevated.

04:51.419 --> 04:53.588
-And that worked?
-Not really.

04:53.671 --> 04:57.091
But half an Ativan did.
It knocked me right out.

04:57.174 --> 04:59.385
And if I was asleep first,
it didn't bother me.

05:00.135 --> 05:02.513
I guess that's not helpful
in this situation.

05:09.395 --> 05:11.146
That's not happening.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.940
Today or any other day.

05:13.023 --> 05:14.274
It's just until it dries.

05:14.359 --> 05:16.276
It's just until... No!

05:16.361 --> 05:18.237
<i>Mi casa</i> is not <i>su casa, comprende?</i>

05:18.321 --> 05:19.905
I mean, okay,

05:19.989 --> 05:23.117
but when it starts to grow mildew,
we're both gonna smell it.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.244
You gotta think globally.

05:25.328 --> 05:26.829
[Red chuckling]

05:27.955 --> 05:30.791
-You have one hour.
-Let's see how it goes.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.044
I mean, it's a little humid, you know?

05:38.424 --> 05:39.509
Yep.

05:45.556 --> 05:46.932
Uh, nope.

05:47.016 --> 05:48.350
Error.

05:48.434 --> 05:50.978
Your shoes can't go on that floor, scarfy.

05:51.729 --> 05:52.772
They're shoes.

05:52.855 --> 05:55.232
I'm aware, but you live on the top bunk.

05:55.315 --> 05:57.693
The floor is a part of the bottom bunks.

05:57.777 --> 05:59.445
[female officer] Count time, ladies.

05:59.529 --> 06:00.738
Let's move it!

06:00.821 --> 06:02.031
[inmate sighs]

06:03.282 --> 06:06.201
So, I'm supposed to, what,
hang shit off the ceiling?

06:06.285 --> 06:08.287
You free to do whatever you want
with the ceiling.

06:08.370 --> 06:09.580
That ain't a way to live.

06:09.664 --> 06:12.542
Look, all I'm sayin' is,
before y'all got here,

06:12.625 --> 06:14.919
this floor was bottom-bunk property.

06:15.002 --> 06:17.713
Now, you showin' your face
don't change the rules.

06:17.797 --> 06:19.632
I don't care how much
your mama loves you.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.677
Um, excuse me, sir,

06:22.760 --> 06:26.013
is it okay if I keep
my shoes on the floor?

06:27.473 --> 06:28.599
Sure.

06:30.893 --> 06:34.647
Okay, okay, that's how you want it?

06:34.730 --> 06:37.357
You and Tova got beef now.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.695
First of all, your name ain't Tova.

06:40.778 --> 06:42.613
I'm sorry?

06:42.697 --> 06:44.699
Black people been naming
their kids some crazy shit,

06:44.782 --> 06:46.366
but Tova ain't on the list.

06:46.451 --> 06:48.536
Unless the "V" is, like,
a five or somethin'.

06:48.619 --> 06:50.580
It's Hebrew.

06:51.330 --> 06:53.499
[clicks tongue] Please, you ain't no Jew.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.335
You wanna say that again, bitch?

06:57.294 --> 06:59.464
Like you was born in Karachi.

06:59.547 --> 07:00.548
[Taystee laughs]

07:00.631 --> 07:02.216
[female officer]
Okay, that's it for count.

07:02.299 --> 07:05.094
Remember, we have a meeting
in the chapel in five minutes.

07:06.428 --> 07:08.973
Everyone should be walking.

07:09.849 --> 07:11.100
[inmates muttering]

07:15.187 --> 07:16.689
Even you, puffy head.

07:23.613 --> 07:25.364
[indistinct chatter]

07:26.616 --> 07:28.534
There's so many Mexicans now.

07:28.618 --> 07:30.244
It's like a Home Depot
parkin' lot in here.

07:30.327 --> 07:31.328
Dominicans.

07:31.411 --> 07:33.623
If you're gonna be racist,
you gotta be accurate,

07:33.706 --> 07:35.583
or you just look dumb.

07:35.666 --> 07:39.462
Is Dominicans the ones that
wear gold chains and smoke cigars

07:39.545 --> 07:41.255
-and swim to Florida?
-No.

07:41.338 --> 07:43.508
Is it the coffee and the coke
and the "Hips Don't Lie"?

07:43.591 --> 07:46.093
No, they talk a lot
and play baseball,

07:46.176 --> 07:47.845
and they're always like,
"I'm super not black,"

07:47.928 --> 07:49.555
even though Haiti
is the exact same island.

07:49.639 --> 07:50.973
That's right.

07:51.682 --> 07:52.975
Yeah, I hate them.

07:55.144 --> 07:57.229
Caputo! [clapping]

07:57.312 --> 07:58.438
Morning, ladies.

07:58.523 --> 08:02.317
For those of you who don't know,
I am Mr. Caputo,

08:02.401 --> 08:06.113
and I am the Director of Human Activity
here at Litchfield.

08:06.196 --> 08:07.948
This is CO Piscatella.

08:08.032 --> 08:10.535
I have asked him
to stay on here at camp

08:10.618 --> 08:13.829
as our new Captain of the Guards.

08:14.872 --> 08:16.081
It's my old job.

08:16.165 --> 08:18.626
-Judy King!
-[inmate yelling] Judy!

08:18.709 --> 08:20.335
So...

08:20.419 --> 08:24.048
things have gotten a little
crowded around here, huh?

08:25.340 --> 08:28.218
We at MCC are aware

08:28.302 --> 08:31.013
that new situations can be trying
for you ladies.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.432
So we called this meeting
to let you know

08:33.515 --> 08:38.062
of the measures we're taking
for your comfort and safety.

08:38.145 --> 08:42.857
For instance, porta-potties have been
installed out in the yard

08:42.942 --> 08:45.152
to take some of the...

08:45.235 --> 08:47.905
strain from the bathrooms.

08:47.988 --> 08:50.240
We gotta shit outside now?

08:50.324 --> 08:53.578
Side note, porta-potty maintenance
will be an additional responsibility

08:53.661 --> 08:55.329
for our janitorial jobs crew.

08:55.412 --> 08:56.997
[Taystee] Hell, no!
[Suzanne] Yes!

08:57.081 --> 08:58.290
We gonna get jobs?

08:58.373 --> 09:01.335
Job assignments for new inmates
is still under review.

09:01.418 --> 09:03.420
We'll get to that at a future time.

09:03.503 --> 09:09.093
MCC realizes it can be challenging
living with this many people.

09:09.176 --> 09:12.179
But we thought ahead.

09:12.262 --> 09:16.684
And today, on your way out,
each of you will receive...

09:16.767 --> 09:19.687
a free pair of earplugs.

09:19.770 --> 09:21.188
-You're kidding me, right?
-[inmate 1] Oh, man!

09:21.271 --> 09:22.356
[Taystee] Judy King!

09:22.439 --> 09:26.736
You just pop these babies in,
lie back in your bunk,

09:26.819 --> 09:29.404
and it's...
like you're on a desert island.

09:29.488 --> 09:31.949
Where is Sophia Burset?

09:32.032 --> 09:33.033
[inmate 2] Where is she?

09:33.117 --> 09:35.578
[inmate 3] That's some bullshit, Caputo.

09:35.661 --> 09:37.412
We also have a plan in place

09:37.496 --> 09:40.457
for stress management
in these transitional times.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.209
Breathing exercises.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.253
Calm you right down.

09:44.336 --> 09:46.546
CO Piscatella, please.

09:46.631 --> 09:48.716
Okay, so...

09:48.799 --> 09:53.470
we are going to inhale on a count of five,
hold it for five,

09:53.553 --> 09:57.182
then exhale on a count of five, okay?

09:57.266 --> 09:58.893
Repeat after me.

09:58.976 --> 10:00.352
[inhales deeply]

10:00.435 --> 10:02.146
[mock inhaling]

10:03.230 --> 10:04.523
[scoffing]

10:06.942 --> 10:09.361
-[air horn blaring]
-[all exclaiming]

10:09.444 --> 10:10.487
-Jesus Christ!
-Whoa!

10:10.570 --> 10:12.782
He couldn't have passed out
the earplugs first?

10:12.865 --> 10:15.159
I'm sorry, did that sound
in any way optional?

10:15.242 --> 10:18.370
Because it could save your life one day.

10:18.453 --> 10:21.456
Now... inhale!

10:21.540 --> 10:23.626
[all inhaling]

10:25.127 --> 10:26.837
[speaking Spanish]
Our lives are about to change, Ruiz.

10:26.921 --> 10:28.005
About to?

10:28.463 --> 10:30.465
Somebody already stole
my shower shoes.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.635
Look around you, dumbass.
Don't you get it?

10:32.718 --> 10:35.638
-What?
-We're the majority now.

10:35.721 --> 10:37.014
[chuckles]

10:40.893 --> 10:41.936
Whoo.

10:42.019 --> 10:44.396
The Colombian cartels...

10:44.479 --> 10:45.898
their time is over!

10:45.981 --> 10:49.234
Now, it's the Mexicans
moving powder up I-90

10:49.318 --> 10:52.321
and deliverin' it to our neighborhoods,
like the fuckin' UPS guy!

10:53.072 --> 10:55.449
They don't care about us,
they don't care about our family,

10:55.532 --> 10:57.076
they don't care about our heritage.

10:59.619 --> 11:01.288
They're all about the money.

11:01.371 --> 11:02.748
We're all about love!

11:02.832 --> 11:04.917
[all speaking Spanish] Homeland forever!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.501
[speaking English]
That's why we're gonna destroy 'em.

11:06.585 --> 11:08.587
These <i>cundangos</i> think
they're gonna run our city?

11:08.671 --> 11:09.714
Well, guess what.

11:09.797 --> 11:13.258
El Chapo's in jail,
but El León is still here!

11:13.342 --> 11:14.551
Dominican forever!

11:14.634 --> 11:16.428
[all speaking Spanish] Homeland forever!

11:17.221 --> 11:20.432
[speaking English]
Now, for the real reason we're here.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.601
To say happy birthday
to my baby girl, Maria!

11:22.684 --> 11:24.729
-Come on, Maria!
-[all cheering]

11:27.898 --> 11:28.899
[grunts]

11:28.983 --> 11:30.192
[laughs]

11:31.443 --> 11:34.905
See, princess? This is all for you.

11:34.989 --> 11:36.949
Everybody came out tonight for you.

11:38.784 --> 11:39.785
[upbeat music playing]

11:39.869 --> 11:41.787
-My cake.
-That's your cake!

11:42.371 --> 11:43.789
What's that, honey?
What's it say there?

11:43.873 --> 11:45.290
[Maria] Maria!
[El León] Who's that?

11:45.374 --> 11:47.584
-Me.
-That's you! That's right!

11:47.667 --> 11:49.754
Happy birthday.
Give Daddy a kiss.

11:51.046 --> 11:52.464
[El León laughs]

11:54.633 --> 11:57.970
[speaking Spanish] Arlenis,
still the hottest girl at the party.

11:58.846 --> 12:01.140
Shut your lying mouth.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.600
Happy birthday.

12:03.683 --> 12:07.104
I made my special quipes for you.

12:08.563 --> 12:09.606
[speaking Spanish]

12:11.441 --> 12:13.652
No. Put that away. What are you doing?
It's a party.

12:13.735 --> 12:14.945
Take it.

12:15.029 --> 12:16.155
For your son's leg.

12:16.613 --> 12:18.115
Surgery is expensive.

12:21.827 --> 12:22.995
<i>Gracias,</i> León.

12:23.078 --> 12:24.538
[both speaking Spanish]

12:26.540 --> 12:27.917
We take care of our people.

12:30.335 --> 12:31.879
[speaking Spanish]

12:33.755 --> 12:35.340
-[Maria exclaiming]
-[El León laughs]

12:41.847 --> 12:43.223
[speaking English]
What do you say, baby?

12:43.307 --> 12:44.975
[speaking Spanish] Homeland forever!

12:45.059 --> 12:47.436
[speaking English] Yes!

12:47.519 --> 12:49.229
You know, you're captain now.

12:49.313 --> 12:52.107
You can take off that uniform,
put on a suit.

12:52.191 --> 12:55.694
I prefer the uniform, sir.
It keeps me action-ready.

12:58.113 --> 13:00.950
-Healy?
-Yes, sir?

13:01.033 --> 13:02.868
Boss-man, sir.

13:02.952 --> 13:05.454
Listen, I put Judy King in room four.

13:05.537 --> 13:09.208
Everybody who used to be in room four,
I moved into room five.

13:10.417 --> 13:11.961
You gave her a private room?

13:12.044 --> 13:15.589
No, that would be special treatment.
I've given her...

13:15.672 --> 13:17.466
a business class room.

13:17.549 --> 13:18.675
By herself?

13:18.758 --> 13:21.846
No, we're giving her a roommate,
like everyone else who's--

13:21.929 --> 13:25.557
Like everyone else who has 39 roommates,
but that's on an average.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.476
Why are you riding me on this one?

13:27.559 --> 13:30.562
HQ has got its twat in a knot over this.

13:30.645 --> 13:33.941
Public relations, yada yada.
We gotta keep her happy.

13:34.024 --> 13:37.402
You do understand the business
that we're doing here?

13:37.486 --> 13:41.240
Yes, the business I'm in charge of.

13:41.323 --> 13:45.285
So you need to find me someone
she can get along with.

13:45.369 --> 13:49.915
-You know the ladies.
-I'm processing 80 new inmates, Joe.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.833
I got enough on my plate here.

13:51.917 --> 13:56.922
Well, scrape it off.
Judy King is your new main course.

13:58.590 --> 14:00.467
Watch your attitude, Healy.

14:00.550 --> 14:05.639
MCC, they love a recent college graduate
with no salary quote.

14:10.895 --> 14:12.312
[inmates grumbling]

14:13.939 --> 14:18.402
Yes, if he goes off the pills,
his balls might go back to a normal size,

14:18.485 --> 14:19.904
but so will everything else.

14:19.987 --> 14:22.907
It'll be like 2009 all over again.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.116
Benny?

14:24.199 --> 14:25.659
Yeah.

14:25.742 --> 14:27.912
I'm okay.

14:27.995 --> 14:31.081
Listen, <i>papi,</i> I need you to do
something for me, all right?

14:31.165 --> 14:36.086
I want you to go over to Michael's
and tell his mom that Sophia's in the SHU.

14:37.546 --> 14:39.589
And she didn't do nothin' wrong.

14:46.721 --> 14:49.975
[inmate 1] Oh, that ain't right.
[inmate 2] Come on, man.

14:50.059 --> 14:51.685
[inmates muttering in Spanish]

14:59.776 --> 15:01.070
[Maritza chuckles]

15:02.654 --> 15:04.406
Hey, Doggett.

15:06.616 --> 15:08.202
I'm feeling a lot better.

15:09.286 --> 15:11.997
-How you feelin'?
-I'm okay.

15:12.081 --> 15:14.583
-That was a gnarly seizure.
-I'm fine.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.419
You should really make sure
you're gettin' enough rest.

15:17.502 --> 15:19.046
I read that helps.
I've been readin' up.

15:19.129 --> 15:20.214
Yeah?

15:20.297 --> 15:23.342
Thanks, okay, for readin'.

15:28.472 --> 15:31.558
Yeah, uh, good night's sleep, Doggett.

15:31.641 --> 15:33.310
That'll fix you right up.

15:34.728 --> 15:37.356
Well, ain't he thoughtful?

15:37.439 --> 15:41.193
Got a real tight ass on him, too.
Have you noticed?

15:41.276 --> 15:43.195
Reminds me of my second husband.

15:43.278 --> 15:44.779
Mmm.

15:44.863 --> 15:46.323
Lucky you.

15:50.244 --> 15:54.623
Look, frankly, I don't know why Mr. Caputo
didn't leave me in my assigned bunk.

15:54.706 --> 15:56.666
I would've been perfectly happy there.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.710
Well, I'm sure you would've.

15:58.793 --> 16:02.672
Although, let's admit it.
That bunk was a bit...

16:03.923 --> 16:05.759
urban for you.

16:05.842 --> 16:07.177
You mean black?

16:08.762 --> 16:13.850
Well, no, I mean, you don't wanna
be the only star in the night sky.

16:13.933 --> 16:16.686
Oh, I have no problem
with black people, Mr. Healy.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.147
Do you?

16:19.481 --> 16:21.400
No, of course not.

16:21.483 --> 16:24.069
They're friendly, individually.

16:25.237 --> 16:28.157
-As a group, though--
-Well, I get along with everybody.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.869
My daddy used to say,
"Well, Judy will talk to a dog in a hat."

16:32.952 --> 16:35.289
[chuckling] Asians, the other way around.

16:35.372 --> 16:38.708
Hardworking people, clean,
but one-on-one, they--

16:38.792 --> 16:40.294
Look, let me tell you somethin'
about a roommate.

16:40.377 --> 16:42.837
All I care is that she's clean
and considerate.

16:42.921 --> 16:45.257
Beyond that, I don't care
if she comes from the moon.

16:46.550 --> 16:53.390
But, of course, no fatties, Nebraskans
or anybody with too much hair.

16:55.725 --> 16:57.727
I understand you perfectly.

17:00.064 --> 17:01.815
[commentator speaking Spanish on TV]

17:09.239 --> 17:12.159
These <i>cocolos</i> all over the ball
like it's a free sandwich.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.867
[Maria] <i>Cocolos?</i> For real?

17:14.453 --> 17:17.080
I bet you got cousins
darker than they are, <i>pana.</i>

17:17.164 --> 17:19.333
They ain't black-black.
They indigenous.

17:19.415 --> 17:22.502
Yo, the score's been zero-zero for,
like, 40 minutes!

17:22.586 --> 17:23.877
This shit is boring!

17:23.962 --> 17:26.089
It's only the most popular sport
in the world,

17:26.173 --> 17:27.840
but whatever, grumpy.

17:27.924 --> 17:30.135
It's not a sport. It's running.

17:30.219 --> 17:31.845
[inmate] Yeah, we wanna watch
the Travel Channel.

17:31.928 --> 17:34.598
They got a show on there
about hotels in Europe

17:34.681 --> 17:35.974
where they have swim-up bars.

17:36.058 --> 17:37.476
-No.
-What?

17:37.559 --> 17:38.685
She asked nicely!

17:38.768 --> 17:42.272
And I said, "No."
You need a replay on anything else?

17:42.356 --> 17:45.609
She ain't swimming to Euro booze
no time soon anyhow.

17:45.692 --> 17:47.194
Hey, come on.

17:47.277 --> 17:49.113
You gonna let 'em step?

17:49.196 --> 17:52.282
[mouths] Look how many there fucking are.
Come on.

17:52.366 --> 17:53.408
Fuckin' brownies.

17:53.492 --> 17:55.327
[scoffs] There ain't never just one.

18:00.832 --> 18:01.958
[speaking Spanish] Yo, Flores.

18:06.546 --> 18:08.047
What's up with you?

18:08.132 --> 18:10.842
Everyone's already pissed at us.

18:10.925 --> 18:14.304
You're acting like an asshole.

18:14.388 --> 18:15.722
It's a World Cup qualifier.

18:15.805 --> 18:17.516
[speaks Spanish]

18:17.599 --> 18:21.520
[speaking English] Never in the history of
FIFA has the Dominican Republic qualified.

18:21.603 --> 18:23.522
[speaking Spanish] Because they stink.

18:23.605 --> 18:26.150
-So what the fuck?
-It's about national pride.

18:26.233 --> 18:27.859
[speaking English] Fuck national pride.

18:27.942 --> 18:30.279
-[in Spanish] What is the matter with you?
-Their coach is from Cuba!

18:30.362 --> 18:31.571
That's not his fault.

18:31.655 --> 18:33.240
You know it's all bullshit, right?

18:34.616 --> 18:37.202
[speaking English] Like,
we're all the same, Cuban, Puerto Ricans.

18:37.286 --> 18:40.414
[speaking Spanish] We're all mestizos,
we all eat rice and beans.

18:40.497 --> 18:43.625
Holy shit, when people hear about this,
there will be no more war.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.335
[speaking English] Fuck you, Flores.

18:45.419 --> 18:47.629
[speaking Spanish]
You can't even tell us apart.

18:47.712 --> 18:50.424
You thought I was Venezuelan for,
like, two months.

18:50.507 --> 18:54.469
I've been in here three years
getting ignored and shit on.

18:54.553 --> 18:57.556
But now?
No one's gonna push us around.

18:57.639 --> 18:58.723
You hear me?

19:04.896 --> 19:07.816
-[Maria laughing] So stupid.
-I know.

19:10.277 --> 19:11.528
All right!

19:12.487 --> 19:15.199
-Thank you.
-Come on.

19:15.282 --> 19:18.076
[El León] They got fucking factories
churning this shit out, man.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.120
They got the whole market on lock,
the whole country.

19:21.205 --> 19:22.831
Fucking Mexicans, man.

19:22.914 --> 19:24.040
Wait, is that your dad?

19:24.123 --> 19:25.709
It's like cumming inside of Jesus.

19:25.792 --> 19:26.876
[laughing] I'm telling you.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.297
<i>Pero,</i> but for three days,
I felt like I had bugs all over me.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.091
Maria.

19:33.175 --> 19:34.676
Maria's friend. <i>Que hay?</i>

19:34.759 --> 19:36.720
-[chuckles] Hey.
-We gotta study.

19:36.803 --> 19:38.263
You're not gonna introduce us?

19:39.598 --> 19:40.765
I'm Sirena.

19:44.018 --> 19:45.937
Well, it's nice to meet you, Sirena.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.065
You know why they call me El León?

19:49.148 --> 19:51.235
Because you made it up.
Your name is Jorge.

19:51.318 --> 19:52.486
[chuckles]

19:53.737 --> 19:56.698
Our organization is called
Dominican Pride.

19:57.824 --> 20:00.076
Pride, like a herd of lions.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.538
-Where you from?
-Inwood.

20:03.622 --> 20:06.583
-[clicks tongue] Where you really from?
-San Cristóbal.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.543
When I was like two, though.
I don't remember.

20:08.627 --> 20:11.296
It don't matter. You still got the blood
running through your veins.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.673
-Oh, my God!
-I guess. [chuckles]

20:13.757 --> 20:15.509
Pretty girl like you,

20:15.592 --> 20:17.636
we need you to have pretty babies.
You hear me?

20:17.719 --> 20:20.472
Ugh! What is your problem?
<i>Tu ta pasao!</i>

20:20.555 --> 20:22.181
<i>Qué?</i> What? I'm being friendly!

20:22.266 --> 20:25.477
-Come on, let's get out of here!
-What, you embarrassed now?

20:25.560 --> 20:27.061
I made you, baby girl!

20:27.145 --> 20:31.525
You got my blood and my nose.
And for that, I'm sorry, okay?

20:31.608 --> 20:32.859
[laughs]

20:32.942 --> 20:34.528
Oh, my God!

20:39.324 --> 20:42.076
So, that's why you never want
anyone to come over.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.288
They all front like, <i>"La patria,"</i>

20:44.371 --> 20:47.416
but all they really do is sell drugs
and drink Presidente,

20:47.499 --> 20:51.545
then complain about, "Presidente doesn't
taste the same as like back home."

20:51.628 --> 20:53.463
The machete thing is cool.

20:53.547 --> 20:56.174
Why can't he just run
a bodega or something?

20:56.258 --> 20:57.342
Drive a bus?

20:57.426 --> 20:59.135
-[siren wails]
-[man] Hey!

21:02.806 --> 21:04.140
[panting]

21:06.268 --> 21:07.352
Oh, shit!

21:07.436 --> 21:10.314
It's that Mexican <i>papi chulo</i>
that hangs out next to school.

21:15.402 --> 21:17.028
[officer] Where is it? Come on.

21:25.662 --> 21:26.830
[gasps]

21:28.998 --> 21:30.249
[indistinct radio chatter]

21:30.334 --> 21:31.835
There's nothin'.

21:31.918 --> 21:34.504
Yeah, because you ditched it in the alley.

21:34.588 --> 21:35.839
We're not idiots, son.

21:42.637 --> 21:44.222
[grunts]

21:45.432 --> 21:47.266
Turn around. Behind your back.

21:50.395 --> 21:52.856
Hey, I'm not seein' anything.

21:52.939 --> 21:54.691
How about our friend there?

21:54.774 --> 21:55.817
Hey, you!

21:55.900 --> 21:57.444
Where'd you come from?

21:57.527 --> 21:58.695
I was just takin' a walk.

21:58.778 --> 22:00.489
Hands up! Against the wall!

22:00.572 --> 22:01.865
Ow! Ouch!

22:01.948 --> 22:04.409
What the-- Ow! Come on, man!

22:09.956 --> 22:12.083
-Anything?
-Nothing but ass.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.418
-Fuck you!
-Watch your mouth, little girl!

22:13.502 --> 22:15.462
I ain't done nothin'!
You're wasting your time, yo!

22:15.545 --> 22:17.171
Shit!

22:19.716 --> 22:21.050
[Red] Ah!

22:22.636 --> 22:24.388
What are you smiling about?

22:26.848 --> 22:31.310
Just thinkin' about when I first got here
and all the shit that you put me through.

22:31.395 --> 22:34.981
But now look,
I'm at the big girls' table.

22:36.357 --> 22:39.986
Chapman and Reznikov sit here.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.406
And Norma.

22:42.489 --> 22:46.618
So, you're enjoying this, hmm?
Soaking in it like a bubble bath.

22:46.701 --> 22:48.620
What's not to like?

22:48.703 --> 22:50.914
Last few days,
I'm a Gambino up in here.

22:50.997 --> 22:54.418
Yes, I have noticed that you talk
with your hands more lately.

22:55.419 --> 22:57.253
[whispers] What should I cook
for your funeral?

22:57.336 --> 22:58.422
Pasta.

22:58.505 --> 23:01.925
You know, if I wanted to eat
a giant harsh-mellow,

23:02.008 --> 23:03.635
I'd be hanging out with Vause right now.

23:03.718 --> 23:07.138
You get some power in here,
they come gunning for you, darling.

23:07.221 --> 23:08.515
Trust me.

23:08.598 --> 23:13.144
Especially when they ask for their pay
and you don't have it.

23:14.270 --> 23:18.525
But they're scared of me.
That's my protective coating.

23:19.609 --> 23:23.196
I cold-heartedly fed
my own paramour to the wolves.

23:23.279 --> 23:24.614
She was a rebound,

23:24.698 --> 23:28.827
and you retaliated against her
after she stole your money.

23:28.910 --> 23:30.995
So, what I learned from that is,

23:31.079 --> 23:33.331
don't give Chapman
the chance to retaliate.

23:33.414 --> 23:34.583
Take her out first.

23:34.666 --> 23:36.626
Come on, now you're just tryin' to...

23:37.752 --> 23:39.378
scare me. I'm...

23:43.800 --> 23:45.384
Do you think that I should get a shiv?

23:45.469 --> 23:46.761
[laughs]

23:46.845 --> 23:51.224
What, so they can take it away from you
and stab you in the throat?

23:51.307 --> 23:52.767
No, listen.

23:52.851 --> 23:55.353
Have you ever seen the president anywhere

23:55.436 --> 23:58.815
without an armored car
and a bunch of commandos in suits?

23:58.898 --> 24:01.192
No, because without them,

24:01.275 --> 24:04.320
he is still a Poindexter with skinny legs.

24:04.403 --> 24:05.864
Like you.

24:07.156 --> 24:10.619
So, you're saying I need to develop
kind of like a...

24:10.702 --> 24:12.120
mystique?

24:12.203 --> 24:15.915
You need them to think
you're stronger than you actually are.

24:18.668 --> 24:19.794
That's what you do.

24:19.878 --> 24:23.047
Me? Oh, no.

24:23.131 --> 24:25.592
My power is no illusion.

24:25.675 --> 24:28.637
I can fucking demolish you.

24:35.519 --> 24:38.813
Norma, you are a deadly force.

24:55.955 --> 24:57.248
Where's my shit?

24:57.999 --> 24:59.668
All the stuff I had on the window?

24:59.751 --> 25:02.712
Well, you like the floor so much,
I put it down there.

25:05.006 --> 25:09.468
I lost the space on top of my locker,
so I had to make it up.

25:09.553 --> 25:12.972
That's not my problem,
and this half of the window is my half.

25:13.056 --> 25:17.561
You on the east side of the cubicle.
This part belongs to the west bunk!

25:18.144 --> 25:20.396
How you even know what's
east and west up in here?

25:20.479 --> 25:23.357
When you pray to Mecca five times a day,
you figure that shit out!

25:24.776 --> 25:26.903
Bottom line,
I got way more things than you.

25:26.986 --> 25:27.987
Fair is fair.

25:28.071 --> 25:29.322
"Fair"?

25:29.405 --> 25:31.032
Well, by "fair," I actually mean,

25:31.115 --> 25:34.118
"I'm bigger and stronger,
and I got more friends."

25:34.202 --> 25:37.413
It's from the Latin word "fairay,"
meaning,

25:37.496 --> 25:39.332
"Go suck a fart...

25:39.415 --> 25:40.875
five times a day."

25:43.670 --> 25:45.129
You really wanna go there with me?

25:45.213 --> 25:48.299
Oh, went there, bought a house,
moved in, bitch.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.426
And now I'm remodeling the kitchen.

25:58.101 --> 25:59.435
That's what I thought.

26:03.732 --> 26:04.733
[sighs]

26:05.692 --> 26:07.443
[knocking on door]

26:09.237 --> 26:10.571
Hey.

26:13.658 --> 26:14.659
Hi.

26:14.743 --> 26:15.952
Welcome.

26:17.787 --> 26:19.497
[chuckles]

26:21.708 --> 26:23.459
[snoring]

26:32.677 --> 26:33.678
[inmate coughing]

26:35.263 --> 26:36.640
[snoring continues]

26:37.891 --> 26:39.684
[snoring continues]

26:43.688 --> 26:44.773
[groans]

26:46.650 --> 26:48.526
[snoring quiets]

26:48.609 --> 26:50.028
[snoring stops]

26:53.447 --> 26:54.658
[sighs contentedly]

26:55.909 --> 26:57.118
[snoring resumes]

27:08.254 --> 27:09.588
[snoring stops]

27:11.049 --> 27:12.591
[sighs]

27:12.676 --> 27:14.177
[snoring resumes]

27:18.389 --> 27:19.598
[snoring stops]

27:21.559 --> 27:22.811
[sighs]

27:24.771 --> 27:25.897
[sighs heavily]

27:27.606 --> 27:29.150
[snoring resumes loudly]

27:29.233 --> 27:30.526
[gasps]

27:33.487 --> 27:34.488
[groans]

27:36.783 --> 27:38.409
[bed creaking]

27:42.872 --> 27:43.915
[inmate] Twenty-two...

27:51.005 --> 27:52.716
[exhales]

27:58.387 --> 28:01.390
Did I do something to hurt you
in a previous life?

28:02.683 --> 28:04.728
I'm just stretching.
I didn't think you'd feel it.

28:04.811 --> 28:06.270
Well, I do.

28:07.188 --> 28:08.481
So, knock it off.

28:09.733 --> 28:12.276
You got a lot of anger, Chapman.

28:14.195 --> 28:15.404
[inmate 1 yawning]

28:21.786 --> 28:23.496
[inmate 2] Come on, get up.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.790
[inmate 1 sighs]

28:26.457 --> 28:27.917
[indistinct chatter]

28:35.424 --> 28:38.136
I don't know about you, kid,
but I'm not seein' it.

28:39.595 --> 28:41.723
What exactly are you
supposed to be seein'?

28:41.806 --> 28:43.599
Her limping around or somethin'?

28:43.682 --> 28:45.810
Let's just say that when you were...

28:45.894 --> 28:46.978
violated...

28:50.439 --> 28:52.859
you went through
a significant dip in morale.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.406
Well, maybe she's just
covering it up, you know,

28:58.489 --> 29:00.699
like turn that rape upside down
or whatever.

29:01.868 --> 29:05.038
Or maybe there's nothing to cover.
I mean, it's only been a couple of days.

29:05.121 --> 29:06.455
Maybe he's gotta warm up to it.

29:14.672 --> 29:16.800
-I don't...
-No, no.

29:16.883 --> 29:18.968
-No.
-Oh, shit!

29:19.052 --> 29:21.763
-See, I knew it.
-Oh, fuckin' asshole!

29:21.846 --> 29:23.514
No, don't cry.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.349
[both laughing]

29:25.433 --> 29:27.018
-Stop! I'm just kidding!
-You're a dick!

29:27.101 --> 29:28.186
[scoffs]

29:31.981 --> 29:34.650
He's still a fucking asshole.

29:34.733 --> 29:38.321
I mean, everyone tells you
it's gonna be completely different,

29:38.404 --> 29:41.282
but you don't really understand

29:41.365 --> 29:44.702
until you hear the words
"husband and wife."

29:44.786 --> 29:46.495
And then, it's just like...

29:46.579 --> 29:48.664
[exclaims] I mean,

29:48.747 --> 29:52.043
you were like Dorothy, you know,
walking out the door of your house,

29:52.126 --> 29:55.463
and there's all those little midgets,
and they're just givin' you candy.

29:55.546 --> 29:56.630
You know what I mean?

29:58.257 --> 29:59.467
Sure.

30:00.593 --> 30:04.388
For instance, for breakfast, he had eggs.

30:05.181 --> 30:08.977
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know.

30:09.978 --> 30:15.608
I mean, the connection is so deep,
it's like I'm inside his head.

30:16.609 --> 30:18.277
It's spiritual.

30:18.361 --> 30:22.615
I mean, this is the kinda connection
you have with someone

30:22.698 --> 30:28.162
when they 100%, completely and utterly,
belong to you forever and ever and ever,

30:28.246 --> 30:30.874
and you pretty much got their doinker
locked up in a little box

30:30.957 --> 30:32.917
until the day that he dies.

30:33.501 --> 30:35.211
Amazing, right?

30:37.088 --> 30:38.589
Hey.

30:38.672 --> 30:40.424
You know, I know you're single,

30:40.508 --> 30:43.552
and you're probably jealous
about everything,

30:43.636 --> 30:46.389
but I was thinking,
seeing how we're friends,

30:46.472 --> 30:51.144
maybe you could just push through that
and be a little happy for me.

30:55.814 --> 30:58.026
Sorry. Okay.

31:01.154 --> 31:03.281
So...

31:03.364 --> 31:04.991
what's his favorite color?

31:10.621 --> 31:12.415
Why you gotta be like that?

31:12.498 --> 31:13.707
What?

31:16.377 --> 31:18.046
-Hey, Vause.
-Oh, shit.

31:18.129 --> 31:19.338
What's new?

31:24.218 --> 31:26.220
-How many fucking trays can there be?
-Whoa!

31:26.304 --> 31:30.058
It was bad enough before these fucking
plantain-eating Dominican bitches came.

31:30.141 --> 31:33.102
-Everyone's gotta eat.
-They're fucking everywhere!

31:33.186 --> 31:35.604
They're taking over the TVs,
blocking the bathrooms,

31:35.688 --> 31:37.398
and commissary's all out of VapoRub.

31:37.481 --> 31:39.025
Like, no offense, but it's the truth.

31:39.108 --> 31:40.151
[in Spanish]
You see what I'm talking about?

31:40.234 --> 31:41.402
[speaking English]
Just leave her alone, okay?

31:41.485 --> 31:43.821
She tried to do the right thing.
Her baby got snatched up, and--

31:43.905 --> 31:45.614
[speaking Spanish]
Being sad made her racist?

31:45.698 --> 31:48.201
[speaking English] She ain't racist.
She's just saying racist things.

31:48.284 --> 31:49.368
[speaking Spanish] See?

31:49.452 --> 31:51.537
How are you okay with this?

31:51.620 --> 31:53.164
[speaking English]
Besides, we're Puerto Rican.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.541
-We're supposed to give you shit.
-Ah.

31:55.624 --> 31:58.836
And Puerto Ricans are not the one
clogging the drain in the Spanish bathroom

31:58.920 --> 32:00.629
-with all that kinky hair.
-Oh!

32:00.713 --> 32:03.007
That would be the Dumb-inicans.
Am I right?

32:03.091 --> 32:04.508
Dumb-in-a-can.

32:05.009 --> 32:06.302
Not you guys.
You guys are cool.

32:06.385 --> 32:07.971
Fuck you, Bacardi bitches.

32:08.054 --> 32:09.055
[Aleida] Ah!

32:11.599 --> 32:12.850
[boxers grunting]

32:14.018 --> 32:15.769
[Maria speaking Spanish]

32:15.853 --> 32:16.895
[Yadriel speaking English] Hey.

32:19.482 --> 32:21.192
I got something that's yours.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.404
Shit.

32:27.115 --> 32:28.699
It wasn't up my cooch or nothing.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.702
I threw it in my window.
You were running past my house.

32:34.122 --> 32:35.164
[exhales]

32:35.248 --> 32:36.249
Thank you.

32:37.541 --> 32:39.418
I guess you owe me big time now, huh?

32:43.839 --> 32:47.593
Oh, you think you could get it back
just like that, after what I went through?

32:48.261 --> 32:50.471
That cop was fucking handsy.

33:01.274 --> 33:02.275
Fight me for it.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.403
Come on, fight me for your shit.

33:08.531 --> 33:09.615
Come on.

33:12.368 --> 33:14.412
[clicks tongue] Pussy.

33:14.495 --> 33:17.623
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!

33:17.706 --> 33:18.749
[man] Oh, damn.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.834
Like, you're a boxer.
I thought you would block me.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.094
I mean, the good thing is,
he always looked out for me, you know,

33:30.178 --> 33:32.888
made sure I went to school and everything.

33:32.971 --> 33:35.683
I'm thinking about being
a dental hygienist.

33:35.766 --> 33:40.521
It's not sexy or nothing,
but I could help people smile, you know?

33:40.604 --> 33:43.607
Get the yellow off,
give them some confidence.

33:43.691 --> 33:45.651
And I don't get grossed out easy.

33:48.404 --> 33:49.905
How about you?

33:52.908 --> 33:55.036
-I got plans.
-Oh, yeah?

33:56.912 --> 33:58.122
What are they?

33:58.206 --> 34:01.375
Convenience stores, like gas stations.

34:02.293 --> 34:03.419
Okay.

34:07.673 --> 34:09.550
You don't talk much, do you?

34:17.433 --> 34:19.976
When I was little, in Texas,

34:20.061 --> 34:22.146
we used to move a lot
so my dad could work.

34:23.438 --> 34:25.483
Sometimes we was driving all night.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.070
I hated moving.

34:30.237 --> 34:33.907
I never knew where we were gonna sleep,
or if the beds were gonna be clean,

34:33.991 --> 34:36.659
or stains on the toilet or whatever.

34:38.246 --> 34:40.289
But when they pulled over to get gas,

34:40.373 --> 34:42.250
they'd let me go inside the store
to get a piece of candy

34:42.333 --> 34:43.876
or an ice cream or something.

34:45.503 --> 34:47.755
That made me happy.

34:47.838 --> 34:51.092
Like, maybe life is all crazy, but...

34:52.260 --> 34:54.594
-at least you can get snacks, you know?
-[Maria laughs]

35:27.211 --> 35:29.838
How you sleeping at night, Joseph Caputo?
Pretty good?

35:29.922 --> 35:32.800
-I'm sorry?
-I'm Crystal Burset.

35:32.883 --> 35:35.469
Sophia Burset's wife.

35:35.553 --> 35:37.305
I see.

35:37.388 --> 35:39.598
Well, I'm here to give you
a chance to fix this

35:39.682 --> 35:42.393
before I call Lambda and the ACLU.

35:42.476 --> 35:46.980
Mrs. Burset, I empathize, I really do,
but it wasn't my decision.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.317
Oh! Well, so then,
you're gonna fight this?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.693
You're gonna get her out?

35:50.776 --> 35:53.612
It was for her own protection.
She'd become violent.

35:53.696 --> 35:55.823
-She assaulted several inmates.
-Oh, that's bullshit.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.741
-She would never do--
-And yet she did.

35:57.825 --> 35:59.452
I know her.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.329
Do you, though?

36:01.412 --> 36:02.788
Do you?

36:03.581 --> 36:07.084
You think you understand what goes
through her head in a place like this?

36:07.168 --> 36:09.878
Everybody in there is doing things
they don't wanna do,

36:09.962 --> 36:12.965
every single day,
things they're not proud of.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.134
Whatever it takes
to keep your head above water.

36:21.265 --> 36:22.600
[car lock beeping]

36:26.937 --> 36:29.064
Do you believe in God, Mr. Caputo?

36:30.065 --> 36:32.860
You believe there's a judge
between right and wrong?

36:34.278 --> 36:37.490
I'm sorry, but I don't have time
to discuss this.

36:37.573 --> 36:39.032
I have a very important meeting.

36:42.203 --> 36:43.454
[sighs]

36:43.537 --> 36:44.830
[car engine starting]

36:51.712 --> 36:54.840
Rosa snored, didn't she?

36:54.923 --> 36:57.593
Like a spoon in the garbage disposal.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.387
So, what did you do about it?

36:59.470 --> 37:02.473
Mostly, I just waited for her
to die of cancer.

37:03.724 --> 37:04.808
Interesting.

37:04.892 --> 37:07.019
Red! No.

37:07.102 --> 37:09.730
But she'd be so quiet if she were dead.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.318
Does Dwight sleep on her back?

37:14.402 --> 37:17.029
Like a starfish in the sun.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.448
There was this nun from Saint Mary's,
Sister Alphonso,

37:19.532 --> 37:22.326
she snored like the Second Coming.
You could hear her from the chapel.

37:22.868 --> 37:25.203
I sewed tennis balls
to the back of her nightgown

37:25.288 --> 37:26.414
so she couldn't roll that way.

37:26.497 --> 37:27.915
And that worked?

37:27.998 --> 37:29.375
Not really.

37:29.458 --> 37:31.835
[sighs] It turns out
she liked to sleep naked.

37:32.461 --> 37:33.462
Hmm.

37:44.515 --> 37:46.600
It's pretty terrible, huh?

37:46.684 --> 37:50.187
Yeah, it's not great,
but my people eat poi, so...

37:50.271 --> 37:52.022
Oh, sure.

37:52.105 --> 37:54.775
-That was a joke.
-Sorry.

37:57.445 --> 37:59.572
Listen, I just came over here
to bury the hatchet.

37:59.655 --> 38:01.490
I'm sorry I've been such a crank.

38:01.574 --> 38:05.661
[chuckles] It's just that all these
new people, it's a big adjustment.

38:06.662 --> 38:07.663
Okay.

38:07.746 --> 38:12.501
What you may not know is, I happen to be
kind of a big deal around here.

38:13.794 --> 38:17.923
I own a small business
that pays my employees actual money

38:18.006 --> 38:22.678
in return for a very small
personal investment,

38:22.761 --> 38:27.265
and I thought maybe I could interest you
in an employment opportunity.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.854
I'm not wearing no g-string,
butt-floss underwear.

38:33.314 --> 38:34.982
And I respect that choice.

38:35.608 --> 38:37.109
Here's what I'm thinking.

38:37.192 --> 38:38.986
[reciting in Italian]

38:43.824 --> 38:46.744
[speaking Italian]

38:48.704 --> 38:50.122
[speaking English] Italian.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.541
By the time I get out of here,
I am gonna be fluent,

38:52.625 --> 38:54.752
and I am headed straight to Florence.

38:54.835 --> 38:56.086
Firenze.

38:56.169 --> 39:02.676
Eat, pray, and mingle limbs
with some Italian <i>con grande pene.</i>

39:02.760 --> 39:06.221
I'm uncomfortable
with this whole situation.

39:06.304 --> 39:09.057
The Florence situation?
Or the big sausage?

39:09.141 --> 39:10.476
[sighs]

39:10.559 --> 39:13.020
Oh, hey, maybe I should go
to Bologna instead.

39:13.103 --> 39:16.357
See, this is exactly...

39:16.440 --> 39:21.945
Okay, I was living a regular prison life
in my regular prison bunk,

39:22.029 --> 39:23.781
and now I'm the one percent.

39:23.864 --> 39:27.993
Everyone else is living
on top of each other like Petco budgies.

39:28.076 --> 39:29.787
This is not fair.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.372
I was a hippie once.

39:31.455 --> 39:32.998
I outgrew it.

39:33.081 --> 39:37.210
You know, but I still do miss that
rickrack edging on blouses and skirts.

39:37.294 --> 39:41.339
Boy, I did love me some rickrack.
I wonder if it's ever gonna come back?

39:41.424 --> 39:45.260
Healy said you specifically requested
a white roommate

39:45.343 --> 39:47.930
of the non-threatening variety.

39:48.013 --> 39:52.518
Well, I know
that yoga makes you super flexible,

39:52.601 --> 39:56.564
but maybe you could just
ease your butt off your shoulders a bit.

39:58.231 --> 40:00.275
I cannot be the only one

40:00.358 --> 40:04.447
who's ever noticed that Counselor Healy
is a bit of a moron.

40:05.989 --> 40:07.032
You are not.

40:07.575 --> 40:11.745
Hmm. Now, look, I know
I'm a little bit famous outside of here.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.289
The powers-that-be made a fuss
and made some assumptions,

40:14.372 --> 40:15.833
but I didn't ask for this.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.460
You didn't turn it down.

40:17.543 --> 40:20.045
Well, I'm not gonna pitch a fit
for my own discomfort.

40:20.128 --> 40:23.173
[chuckles] Lord, call me crazy,
but I have learned,

40:23.256 --> 40:27.553
if someone is offering you something nice,
you shut up and say "thank you."

40:27.636 --> 40:31.139
You can't shut up and say "thank you"
at the same time.

40:31.223 --> 40:33.266
The two things negate one another.

40:33.350 --> 40:35.143
Oh, a dog with a bone, huh?

40:35.227 --> 40:37.521
It's the principle of it.

40:37.605 --> 40:41.900
But you're probably used to having your
asshole polished by everyone you meet.

40:41.984 --> 40:45.696
Oh, maybe 80%, 85%.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.490
Well, you sure make jokes.

40:48.449 --> 40:52.202
Hmm, how about the one
about the criminal who got rich

40:52.285 --> 40:56.582
by making TV-watching saps think
they need an immersion blender

40:56.665 --> 40:59.752
to feel good about themselves?
Now, there's a good one.

40:59.835 --> 41:00.961
You know what I think?

41:02.713 --> 41:06.467
I think that you secretly love
being in this room,

41:06.550 --> 41:08.969
away from all the others.
You think it's nice.

41:09.052 --> 41:13.098
And that's throwing all the crunchy parts
of you into quite a tizzy.

41:17.227 --> 41:21.482
Just because we live together
doesn't mean we have to talk.

41:26.319 --> 41:28.531
That seems perfectly fair.

41:31.742 --> 41:34.286
[speaking Italian]

41:36.371 --> 41:37.790
[speaking English] It's herbal.

41:38.499 --> 41:39.750
[sniffs]

41:39.833 --> 41:41.293
Mmm.

41:41.376 --> 41:42.628
[sighs]

41:43.754 --> 41:45.172
God damn it.

41:46.381 --> 41:47.841
[sighs]

41:47.925 --> 41:50.969
Sounds like we've had some glitches
down at Litchfield.

41:51.053 --> 41:52.846
Glitchfield.

41:53.388 --> 41:55.390
I'm not gonna pretend
it's been smooth sailing.

41:55.473 --> 42:00.103
We've had big problems,
mostly due to the guards walking out,

42:00.187 --> 42:03.691
which, if you remember,
I warned as a possible reaction

42:03.774 --> 42:06.944
-to the cut in benefits and hours.
-But it's all under control now?

42:07.027 --> 42:10.405
No more impromptu swimming lessons?

42:12.658 --> 42:15.661
[stammering] Yes...
No, of course not.

42:17.370 --> 42:18.664
I know what I'm doing.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.165
Well, good,

42:20.248 --> 42:24.502
because our contract with the feds
is giving us 30 grand per head in a bed.

42:24.587 --> 42:29.091
We can't fuck up this gorgeous deal
dear Uncle Sam has gifted us.

42:29.174 --> 42:32.886
Well, then, we need to solve
our security problem.

42:32.970 --> 42:36.724
I've got guards from Max covering
for right now, but that's just temporary.

42:36.807 --> 42:40.227
I need quality COs.
I need guys with experience.

42:40.310 --> 42:43.188
We could pay a bit more,
now that we've got all those beds.

42:43.271 --> 42:48.694
Hmm. Quality COs.
How, how, how?

42:50.153 --> 42:51.154
Veterans.

42:52.990 --> 42:56.284
The government gives tax credits
to companies that hire vets.

42:56.368 --> 42:58.829
You get more money
the longer the vet's been out of work.

42:58.912 --> 43:03.917
We looked into putting that into play
at our offices, but, you know, veterans...

43:04.793 --> 43:06.128
[imitates gunfire]

43:06.211 --> 43:09.464
Right, but if we hire them as guards,

43:09.547 --> 43:13.886
if anything ever happened,
well, they're already in prison, so...

43:14.887 --> 43:16.847
And how much is this credit?

43:16.930 --> 43:20.225
I think it's five or six thousand
if the guy's been unemployed for a year.

43:20.308 --> 43:23.061
And it is double that
if they're on crutches or in a wheelchair,

43:23.145 --> 43:24.938
or something like that, so...

43:25.022 --> 43:28.692
That might make the guard less effective.

43:28.776 --> 43:30.944
Oh, yeah, there is that.

43:31.028 --> 43:34.197
But I think it's a great idea,
hiring vets.

43:34.281 --> 43:37.826
-I could use some guys with discipline.
-Mmm.

43:37.910 --> 43:39.995
[Jack] Problem is getting them
to Litchfield.

43:40.078 --> 43:44.166
Our, um, our shareholders demand
an aggressive cap on wages, so--

43:44.249 --> 43:46.459
We would need
some other kind of incentive, like--

43:46.543 --> 43:48.921
Free haircuts, like at Google.

43:50.923 --> 43:51.924
Housing.

43:52.507 --> 43:56.428
What if we can provide
free housing on campus?

43:56.511 --> 43:58.972
I don't know
if that would be cost-effective.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.599
It's already there.

44:01.684 --> 44:04.186
We got a bunch of cabins by the lake.
A good coat of paint...

44:04.269 --> 44:06.563
Inmate labor is free.

44:06.647 --> 44:07.940
[laughs]

44:08.691 --> 44:11.276
This is a brilliant idea, Joe, really.

44:11.359 --> 44:12.402
[chuckles]

44:13.361 --> 44:16.448
-Thanks to you, Linda.
-No, thanks to you. [laughs]

44:16.531 --> 44:18.033
No, this is you.

44:18.116 --> 44:19.451
-[Jack] All right.
-I guess both of us.

44:19.534 --> 44:22.245
Nice work, Joe and Linda.
[chuckles]

44:22.329 --> 44:25.207
Let's take ten.
What do we got, uh, sandwiches?

44:25.290 --> 44:26.499
[chuckles] Sandwiches.

44:26.583 --> 44:27.876
-Do you wanna...
-Yeah, let's go.

44:27.960 --> 44:29.712
-Yeah. [laughs]
-After you.

44:29.795 --> 44:31.004
Oh, thank you.

44:34.717 --> 44:38.261
Jasmina, slow down.
What are you saying?

44:44.893 --> 44:46.895
Man, a thousand new inmates,

44:46.979 --> 44:50.190
and the only Mexicans
are <i>campesinos</i> from Fresno.

44:50.273 --> 44:53.443
What do you care?
You don't even like other Mexicans.

44:53.526 --> 44:55.487
Been thinking about my ma, you know?

44:55.570 --> 44:57.322
Yeah. How's she doing?

44:58.656 --> 45:00.993
So, if I'm looking
for something positive...

45:02.870 --> 45:05.705
let's just say, I probably don't gotta
get her nothing for Christmas.

45:05.789 --> 45:07.540
If I hadn't buried my feelings so deep

45:07.624 --> 45:09.584
that they only come up
when I watch <i>Stepmom,</i>

45:09.667 --> 45:11.503
I would totally be tearing up right now.

45:12.796 --> 45:15.215
-I know.
-[softly] I'm sorry.

45:16.258 --> 45:17.592
Hey, buddy.

45:19.594 --> 45:20.720
Can I help you?

45:20.804 --> 45:22.765
I was just seeing how you're doing,
you know,

45:22.848 --> 45:26.684
making sure everything's all right
regarding the van or whatever.

45:26.769 --> 45:29.646
Look, it ain't my fault
I got your job, okay?

45:29.729 --> 45:32.732
I got assigned.
I didn't even ask for it, so...

45:32.816 --> 45:34.860
That's cool, that's cool.

45:34.943 --> 45:36.403
Okay.

45:38.738 --> 45:40.198
So, you seen the ducks?

45:40.282 --> 45:41.449
What?

45:42.075 --> 45:44.787
[gasps] You know, some people
can be sleep-walking,

45:44.870 --> 45:46.246
they don't even know it.

45:47.705 --> 45:48.706
No.

45:48.791 --> 45:50.083
What I'm trying to say is,

45:50.167 --> 45:52.627
did you get the ice cream?
You know what I mean?

45:54.129 --> 45:56.714
Aw, it's her brain.

45:56.799 --> 45:59.927
She must've, like, broke it in half
when she drove into that wall.

46:02.470 --> 46:04.973
So, you like ducks?

46:07.184 --> 46:09.519
No. Not anymore.

46:12.730 --> 46:14.191
Excuse me.

46:15.943 --> 46:17.777
Oh, my God.

46:17.861 --> 46:20.738
-Oh, look, it's my favorite soccer fan.
-[laughs]

46:20.823 --> 46:22.199
Up yours, asshole.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.077
Whoa! Are you serious?

46:25.160 --> 46:27.120
I'm enjoying the one time in my day

46:27.204 --> 46:29.664
when there's less than ten
fucking brown bitches in my way.

46:29.747 --> 46:33.085
Hey, maybe they're having
a housekeeping convention in C-Dorm.

46:33.168 --> 46:34.252
[both laughing]

46:34.336 --> 46:36.296
[speaking Spanish]
You jokers are wasting my life.

46:36.379 --> 46:39.507
Hey, we're in America, chalupa.
Speak English.

46:39.591 --> 46:40.926
Your country's turning brown.

46:41.009 --> 46:43.053
There's more of us every day,
fucking <i>pendeja,</i>

46:43.136 --> 46:44.972
and there's fucking nothing
you can do about it!

46:45.055 --> 46:46.598
Oh! [exclaiming]

46:47.099 --> 46:48.516
[Blanca] Ruiz!

46:48.600 --> 46:49.601
Ahh!

46:50.227 --> 46:51.519
[groaning]

46:57.192 --> 46:58.360
[groaning]

47:04.199 --> 47:05.450
[cursing in Spanish]

47:05.533 --> 47:06.701
-[inmate in English] Shit.
-[groans]

47:08.871 --> 47:11.206
[in Spanish] You just stand there
watching, eh? You get a good view?

47:11.289 --> 47:13.625
[in English] Hey, don't worry about her.
Listen, who did this to you?

47:13.708 --> 47:15.502
[speaking Spanish]
That white girl from the TV room.

47:16.044 --> 47:17.337
[inmate sighs]

47:18.130 --> 47:19.131
[speaking English] No.

47:21.508 --> 47:23.551
This is not how we play this.

47:24.386 --> 47:25.720
You're pissed right now.
You ain't thinking.

47:25.803 --> 47:27.597
That's how you make mistakes.

47:27.680 --> 47:31.476
What you gonna do, start some kinda brawl?
Get your asses thrown into Seg?

47:31.559 --> 47:32.810
Then who wins?

47:32.895 --> 47:35.355
So, we just let that bitch get away?

47:37.482 --> 47:39.067
That ain't what I said.

47:46.324 --> 47:49.161
Are you pissed at me about something
and you're taking it out on me?

47:49.244 --> 47:51.704
-This ain't about you.
-Oh, like hell it ain't!

47:52.622 --> 47:54.958
I put food in your mouth,
I take you to school,

47:55.042 --> 47:57.877
I give you a piece of whatever I got.

47:58.753 --> 48:00.588
Well, that don't mean
I gotta be your little robot.

48:00.672 --> 48:02.132
I got a brain.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.592
Is that what that <i>cabrón</i> is telling you?

48:05.843 --> 48:06.886
Hmm?

48:06.970 --> 48:08.596
Whispering in your ear,

48:08.680 --> 48:10.723
trying to steal you from your house,
your father's house?

48:10.807 --> 48:14.019
-No, he ain't done nothing to you!
-Why do you think we ain't got money?

48:14.102 --> 48:16.188
-Ugh.
-Huh?

48:16.271 --> 48:18.982
They've driven me off my own corners,
those fucking roaches.

48:19.066 --> 48:22.110
They're breaking my back.
You understand that?

48:22.194 --> 48:24.321
-They took everything.
-I'm so tired of this shit.

48:24.404 --> 48:26.281
He's just trying to make a living,
same as you.

48:26.364 --> 48:27.449
[scoffs]

48:28.951 --> 48:31.369
-My baby girl is taking <i>cholo</i> dick.
-Yo, stop it.

48:31.453 --> 48:35.915
I have given my life to this organization,
to look out for our people, our identity!

48:35.999 --> 48:37.292
You know what? Fuck you!

48:38.210 --> 48:40.503
Fuck you, fuck the DR,
fuck your stupid fucking bullshit

48:40.587 --> 48:44.382
about, "We're so much better,"
when you're doing the same exact thing!

48:47.760 --> 48:50.472
If this is what it means
to be Dominican...

48:52.515 --> 48:54.642
then I ain't gonna be Dominican no more.

49:02.775 --> 49:04.361
Get out of my house.

49:47.362 --> 49:50.032
It ain't like you only got one soulmate.

49:50.115 --> 49:52.409
You could have a soul connection
with lots of people.

49:52.492 --> 49:56.038
Well, so then, why haven't I vibed
with someone already?

49:56.121 --> 49:58.790
You know, someone who's not
gingerbread in the head?

49:58.873 --> 50:00.667
I've been alive as long as I can remember.

50:00.750 --> 50:04.546
You know, maybe you the exception
prove the rule, and you only got one.

50:04.629 --> 50:05.630
One?

50:05.713 --> 50:09.384
But you got a soul mate
somewhere in the world.

50:10.677 --> 50:11.928
I promise.

50:13.930 --> 50:16.474
[sighing] I hope she speaks English.

50:20.187 --> 50:22.980
Oh, hello!

50:23.065 --> 50:26.943
Looks like somebody lost track
of their beverage!

50:27.026 --> 50:31.781
Ooh, we should act as sleuths
to discover the true owner and return it.

50:31.864 --> 50:33.866
You know,
demonstrate that there's still some...

50:33.950 --> 50:35.160
some good in the world.

50:35.243 --> 50:38.037
[stammers] I see where you're going
with that, and I like it.

50:38.121 --> 50:40.498
-Mmm-hmm.
-Definitely has a lot of upside.

50:40.582 --> 50:42.667
But on the other hand...

50:42.750 --> 50:43.751
[yelps]

50:49.048 --> 50:50.133
Oh...

50:50.217 --> 50:53.010
We could've been sleuthing.

50:55.222 --> 50:57.224
Oh, it's on now.

50:58.891 --> 51:00.935
[inmate crying softly]

51:18.995 --> 51:20.330
[crying continues]

51:33.343 --> 51:35.345
They got him on conspiracy.

51:38.848 --> 51:41.643
Plus two counts assaulting an officer.

51:48.107 --> 51:50.235
He's gonna be old when he gets out.

51:53.363 --> 51:54.947
What am I gonna do?

51:56.408 --> 51:59.452
You're gonna be strong
like you always was.

51:59.536 --> 52:00.703
'Cause you had to.

52:01.871 --> 52:03.623
What am I gonna do?

52:03.706 --> 52:04.957
[shushing]

52:05.041 --> 52:06.042
[sniffling]

52:06.125 --> 52:10.172
There's the two of us still.
Two heads together.

52:13.258 --> 52:15.802
Stop crying. Remember?

52:15.885 --> 52:17.887
Crying makes you ugly and weak.

52:26.854 --> 52:28.022
We got each other.

52:38.658 --> 52:39.951
[groans]

52:42.495 --> 52:43.871
-[gasps]
-[thudding]

52:45.207 --> 52:47.375
[groaning] Ow.

52:47.459 --> 52:49.168
Jesus, Dwight!

52:49.919 --> 52:50.962
[groaning]

52:51.921 --> 52:53.172
I'm okay.

52:56.175 --> 52:58.220
I think I should go to medical.

52:59.095 --> 53:00.222
[Red] Oh.

53:02.056 --> 53:05.477
I should come with you.

53:17.989 --> 53:19.282
[sighs]

53:23.077 --> 53:26.248
What the fuck?
Get off me, man!

53:29.334 --> 53:31.378
-[inmate groaning]
-[blows landing]

53:48.603 --> 53:50.438
[opera music playing faintly]

53:53.775 --> 53:55.777
[inmate breathing deeply]

54:00.239 --> 54:02.158
[opera music continues]

54:18.425 --> 54:19.926
It looks amazing on you.

54:20.009 --> 54:21.303
[Caputo sighs]

54:22.345 --> 54:24.431
[chuckles] You say that to everybody.

54:24.514 --> 54:25.890
It's true, I do.

54:25.973 --> 54:27.809
But this time, I really mean it.

54:27.892 --> 54:30.061
I also say that to everyone. [laughing]

54:30.144 --> 54:31.145
[clears throat]

54:32.397 --> 54:34.399
-How much is it?
-It's actually on sale.

54:34.482 --> 54:36.192
Only $1,100.

54:37.026 --> 54:38.653
-Mmm-hmm.
-[sighs]

54:48.120 --> 54:49.121
I'll take it.

54:49.205 --> 54:50.415
Oh, yay. [chuckles]

54:50.498 --> 54:51.833
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

55:02.844 --> 55:04.346
What the heck happened to them?

55:04.429 --> 55:06.556
I don't know, man.
There's too many people in here.

55:06.639 --> 55:10.017
Everybody getting on each other's nerves,
shit's gonna get stirred.

55:10.101 --> 55:14.647
It's like when the poultry people
just stick all the chickens into one cage

55:14.731 --> 55:16.441
and they start pecking chunks
out of each other.

55:16.524 --> 55:18.067
[chuckles]

55:18.150 --> 55:19.361
Yeah, basically.

55:19.444 --> 55:21.070
Oh, man.

55:21.153 --> 55:23.906
You know, mainly, I was just experiencing
this whole overcrowding thing

55:23.990 --> 55:26.701
as, like, annoying,
but I guess it could be dangerous, too.

55:26.784 --> 55:27.994
Oh!

55:28.077 --> 55:29.829
It could.
It could be really dangerous.

55:29.912 --> 55:30.955
That's why...

55:31.038 --> 55:34.542
[whispering] you're really lucky,
'cause I'm looking out for you.

55:34.626 --> 55:35.793
[laughs]

55:36.669 --> 55:39.005
You know, you're, like,
one of maybe four people in this prison

55:39.088 --> 55:40.757
who actually might be smaller than I am.

55:41.257 --> 55:44.176
Okay, okay, but...
but I got heart, right?

55:44.260 --> 55:45.803
Uh, well, you could use biceps.

55:45.887 --> 55:47.764
-Shit, man.
-[both laugh]

55:47.847 --> 55:49.599
No, I'm kidding.

55:49.682 --> 55:53.478
I'd take heart any day. [laughs]

55:53.561 --> 55:55.187
Good, 'cause that's all I got.

55:55.271 --> 55:57.314
[both laughing]

56:23.841 --> 56:25.092
Go grab me some lunch.

56:25.176 --> 56:27.929
-Go get it yourself.
-You're supposed to be Secret Service.

56:28.012 --> 56:30.347
Secret Service doesn't serve lunch.

56:31.891 --> 56:34.894
Well, maybe they would if they weren't
so busy plowing Colombian hookers.

56:46.781 --> 56:48.074
Save me my seat.

57:12.306 --> 57:13.558
[speaking Spanish]
Someone's still got twos?

57:13.641 --> 57:15.518
[speaking English]
Yo, stop talking the board.

57:16.352 --> 57:17.353
[speaking Spanish] Shit.

57:19.814 --> 57:22.484
<i>Capicúa,</i> bitches. [laughing]

57:22.567 --> 57:24.569
Shit, yo. What I tell you?

57:24.652 --> 57:28.948
I'm unbeatable.
I'm sorry, man. Shit!

57:30.324 --> 57:31.993
-Damn!
-[inmate] Stay put.

57:32.076 --> 57:34.411
-What? What?
-Always.

57:41.711 --> 57:43.963
[speaking Spanish]
Let's see how we do together.

57:47.091 --> 57:48.300
[speaking English] Okay.

57:55.224 --> 57:56.976
