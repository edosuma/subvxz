I love you, Ricki!

03:16.240 --> 03:18.800
- Ricki! I love you, Ricki!
- Heh-heh-heh.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.560
Thanks, everybody.
Thank you, my sweet Daniel.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.473
- I adore you.
- Aw.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.632
Good evening, Tarzana!

03:27.400 --> 03:29.073
- I owe 10?
- That was Tom Petty.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.071
"American Girl" from 197...
What was it, Greg?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.873
- '77.
- Yeah.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.271
'77. Wow.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.080
And, you know,
I am proud to be an American girl...

03:43.320 --> 03:45.471
...born in the best country in the world.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.150
- I know you're proud too, Walt.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.671
Yes, sir. Too bad things aren't being run
very well these days.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.918
Anyway, I'm Ricki Rendazzo...

03:58.120 --> 04:03.195
...and I'd like to take this minute
to introduce my band, the Flash.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.910
We've been the house band here
at The Salt Well since 2008.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.557
Yeah, that was the year
we elected you-know-who.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.911
No offense, Billy.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.510
Ha-ha-ha. Whoa!

04:18.680 --> 04:21.274
Yeah, we joke around.
Anyway, speaking of Billy...

04:21.440 --> 04:23.955
...he's the man on keys.
The great Billy Lambert.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.231
- And we got Buster Frye on bass.
- Buster.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.640
- Mr. Joey Sweeney on the drums.
- Ow!

04:36.920 --> 04:39.196
Newly single, ladies.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.517
- Call me, Joe.
- And finally...

04:43.440 --> 04:46.194
...my right hand man,
Mr. Greg Sandoval...

04:46.400 --> 04:48.756
- ...and his sweet Gibson SG.
- Yeah.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.071
Whoo!

04:51.400 --> 04:53.119
And, you know, uh...

04:53.280 --> 04:56.432
I've been told it's not good
to date someone in the band...

04:56.640 --> 04:59.917
...but honestly, I don't think
it's hurting our sound, right?

05:00.120 --> 05:04.717
- We're not really dating, Greg.
- Oh.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.349
Excuse me, is that not
the correct terminology?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.711
Are we hooking up
like my kid says, right?

05:09.920 --> 05:10.956
Yes.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.236
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.639
Well, we've been spending
some time together, yeah.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.753
I spend time with Buster.
I think you and I are different.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.593
Shit, I hope so. Shit.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.878
Okay, I think this is a conversation
for backstage.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.958
So let's just round it up, okay?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.994
We learned a tune
since our last gig at The Salt Well.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.591
Because some of you have asked
for more of today's hits.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.075
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.432
- And we aim to please. Okay.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.951
- Oh. Thank you, darling.
- Yes, of course.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.594
Hey, Danny,
I'm sorry I couldn't talk before the gig.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.439
- Vocal rest.
- Oh, please.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.429
Vocal rest? She thinks this
is Madison Square Garden. Ha-ha-ha.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.199
- Hey, I...
- Great set, man.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.679
- I take things seriously, that's all.
- I know. I love that about you.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.876
I'm sorry that I, um...

06:47.320 --> 06:51.360
Sorry about what I said onstage.
That was just some fun banter. Heh, heh.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.914
You know, the crowd loves that drama
and tension. Yeah?

06:56.120 --> 06:58.760
- Good one.
- Thanks, boy.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.194
That was just, uh...

07:01.440 --> 07:04.399
Anyway, that was what made
Fleetwood Mac really popular.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.637
- Okay.
- Your purse is vibrating.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.595
If she moved with me,
she wouldn't need that kind of thing.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.918
It's probably my manager.
He's, like, 17.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.951
- Three-one-seven.
- Where's that? Bufu, Egypt?

07:20.160 --> 07:22.197
- It's Indianapolis.
- Hm.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.039
It's a telemarketer.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.711
I once got an Old Navy credit card.
It haunts me to this day.

Good morning to you.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.391
Hey.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.950
It's ringing up. Okay.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.232
That's the way it goes. One.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.715
- Okay, that's 447.74.
- Ouch.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.597
I guess that's why they call it
"total paycheck."

08:01.800 --> 08:04.952
Well, that actually is truly
my total paycheck. Heh, heh.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.956
Four forty-seven, seventy-four.
That's about what I make in a week. Heh.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.316
- How about that?
- Ooh.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.837
And you'd like $150 cash back.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.440
Yes, please.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.400
Can an associate
meet a customer in frozen foods?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.950
There you go. There's your receipt.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.992
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, sir.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.196
Have a good day.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.677
- Let me know how you like those cookies.
- Yeah, right.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.558
- Hey.
- You alienated the customer.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.231
- I...
- I need you to satisfy...

08:41.440 --> 08:43.557
...and delight the customer.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.512
Okay. I'm sorry, Troy.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.794
No, it's okay. Just remember, gratitude.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.355
- Cool. Thanks. Hi.
- Hi.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.153
Thanks.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.514
Come on.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.957
- Hello.
- Linda?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.391
You actually picked up.
I was expecting...

09:32.600 --> 09:35.638
...maybe you'd gotten, you know,
another new phone number.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.234
I'm sorry. I don't have...

09:37.440 --> 09:41.320
I can't figure out how to set up
the message box thing.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.591
You know me. Ha-ha-ha.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.319
Oh, yeah.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.996
Yeah.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.556
What's the problem, Pete?

09:49.760 --> 09:53.640
It's Julie. Max left her.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.112
Where'd he go?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.520
"Where'd he go?"
He left her. He's divorcing her.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.712
He met someone new.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.434
How is Julie?

10:03.640 --> 10:06.235
Well, that's really why I'm calling you.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.070
She's not well.
She's absolutely unhinged.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.749
She's been here at the house now
for a few days.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.799
She hasn't changed her clothes,
she hasn't showered.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.238
Uh, she's a wreck. I'm worried.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.153
Okay.
How is your wife handling all this?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.034
Maureen is in Seattle
visiting her father.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.392
- He is failing.
- Oh, right.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.478
He has Alzheimer's.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.320
No, it's ALS.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.799
Yeah, that's short for Alzheimer's, right?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.396
No, it's not.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.595
Okay, so how can I help?

10:46.120 --> 10:47.520

13:21.080 --> 13:22.196
Let me.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.353
Here. I'll get those.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.353
Hey, who is this?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.313
Is this Ralphie?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.193
No, that's Sigma.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.392
Ralphie passed away a few years ago.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.717
- Excess bloat.
- Aw.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.556
Well, then we're new
to each other, huh?

13:40.760 --> 13:42.319
How was your flight?

13:42.560 --> 13:48.716
It was fine, but travel has really changed
since we took the kids to Disney World.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.673
That was 1988.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.236
Yeah. No, I just mean, you know...

13:53.440 --> 13:56.751
I remember when flying was a treat.
People got dressed up even.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.431
Now I see these young girls in the airport
in their jammy bottoms.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.554
Yeah. Well, I can see
you still put in the effort.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.229
Thanks, Pete.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.193
This is some place.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.437
This is like a mansion.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.872
Thanks.
Yeah, well, double-height entry...

14:15.080 --> 14:18.437
...and Maureen had to have Palladian
windows, so we put those in.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.636
Very classical.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.998
Yeah. I feel like Jefferson at Monticello.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.840
- I'll go tell Julie you're here.
- Heh, heh.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.117
Okay. I'll just have a look around.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.471
Okay. Julie?

14:32.280 --> 14:35.352
Oh, my God.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.634
Look at this place.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.759
Mm-hm.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.680
Mm-hm.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.000
Mm. My, my, my.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.999
Wow.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.076
Man.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.632
Uh, Julie's pretty tired.
But she's glad you're here...

15:53.840 --> 15:56.400
...and looks forward to seeing you
in the morning.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.233
Wrong. No, no, no.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.753
Julie is not looking forward to shit!

16:04.280 --> 16:06.158
Hey, Ju-jee.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.716
Nice of you to grace us
with your presence.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.760
Couldn't make the wedding, but here
you are right in time for the divorce.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.038
Okay. Nobody wanted me
at that wedding.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.432
Do you have a gig or do you always
dress like a hooker from Night Court?

16:21.680 --> 16:24.957
Going through a separation,
it can be a crazy time.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.836
I'm not crazy, Dad.
I've actually never felt such clarity.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.509
Well, there's actually a book
called Crazy Time.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.514
- Oh, shut up, Pete!
- Honey, listen.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.231
This whole thing is not a big deal.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.757
- I read something in Parade magazine.
- No big deal?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.394
A lot of women your age...

16:43.640 --> 16:47.919
- ...having starter marriages and...
- This was not a "starter" marriage.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.715
I was gonna marry Max,
stay with him, have kids...

16:50.920 --> 16:53.355
...and actually raise them to adulthood.

16:53.560 --> 16:56.394
Oh, okay. Julie, just take it easy.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.159
Why are you defending her?

16:58.360 --> 16:59.760
- She is your Max.
- What?

16:59.960 --> 17:02.316
- She walked out on you...
- Hey, no.

17:02.520 --> 17:07.675
- ...just like Max walked out on me.
- But I was never unfaithful, Julie.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.713
Ju-jee...

17:32.360 --> 17:33.919
So, um...

17:36.440 --> 17:39.638
- We'll try again in the morning.
- Yeah, of course.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.438
I'll, uh, give you a ride to the hotel.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.560
Oh...

17:46.720 --> 17:48.871
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.158
I... I'm so sorry.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.354
I could hardly afford the plane ticket,
you know?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.119
And, uh...

17:59.640 --> 18:01.677
- Well, you know, I lost my car.
- Yeah.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.554
- I'm filing for chapter 11.
- I know.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.913
So I just thought since you and Maureen
built this big, new house...

18:09.120 --> 18:12.716
- ...that it wouldn't be a problem.
- It's not a problem, space-wise.

18:12.920 --> 18:13.956
It's, uh...

18:14.160 --> 18:15.753
It's just...

18:16.640 --> 18:18.916
I don't know, a boundary thing.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.437
- But it's fine.
- Mm.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.990
Hope Maureen doesn't mind.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.271
No, Mo's very chill.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.678
I'm the one that tends to get worked up
about certain things.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.037
Maybe Julie gets that from you.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.557
- The bathroom is en suite.
- Oh.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.989
Okay.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.840
So, um, welcome.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.633
Sigma, come.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.320
Come.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.197
- I trained her myself.
- Heh-heh-heh.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.193
Okay, well...

18:53.600 --> 18:54.954
- Welcome.
- Okay.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.879
Good night, Linda.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.675
Good night, Pete.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.036
Linda.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.392
- Linda!
- Huh?

20:02.280 --> 20:04.476
I was a real bitch last night, huh?

20:04.720 --> 20:08.634
Well, it was late. Heh.

20:09.400 --> 20:13.713
My therapist has me on Effexor,
and we need to titrate down a little bit...

20:13.920 --> 20:17.630
...because it's made me volatile,
anorgasmic.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.352
You're having orgasms?

20:20.560 --> 20:22.950
Anorgasmic. "An" means "not."

20:23.200 --> 20:24.520
- It's Latin.
- Oh, I...

20:24.720 --> 20:27.315
Yeah, I know. I knew that.
I just didn't hear you.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.398
- What time is it?
- It's almost 10.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.679
Blowing up here, Mom.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.152
Who's Greg?

20:38.360 --> 20:42.240
He's the lead guitarist in The Flash.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.715
The Flash?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.354
My band, The Flash.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.473
I sent you the Facebook page
a long time ago, remember?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.200
Give me the phone.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.915
- He calls you "babe."
- Yeah, that's an L.A. thing.

20:53.080 --> 20:57.233
Uh-huh. He also makes copious use
of the smiley face emoji.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.518
As well as the cat
with the hearts for eyes.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.551
- How long has Greg been getting it in?
- Hey, let's go to Krupke's.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.957
I need a doughnut.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.876
Uh, I don't have any money.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.480
You have a credit card?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.677
Yeah, but it's linked
to Max's account.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.715
Oh, that's not a problem.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.394
Hop in.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.554
♪ So you do what you gotta do ♪

21:39.040 --> 21:42.112
♪ Come on, girl, walk on ♪

21:44.360 --> 21:48.752
♪ I know you're fighting an uphill battle ♪

21:48.920 --> 21:52.675
♪ But you'll win with a little struggle ♪

21:53.240 --> 21:57.951
♪ 'Cause you're really not that fragile
So walk on ♪♪

22:07.400 --> 22:12.236
You know, it's hard to find a good cruller
in California. Heh, heh.

22:13.560 --> 22:18.635
I guess you got to give up a lot
of special things to become a rock star.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.510
Crullers were the least of it.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.759
Yeah, Linda, that was the subtext.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.472
Listen, honey, I came out here
because I wanted to help you.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.314
I know you're in shock right now, right?

22:45.520 --> 22:48.160
And I know
you're probably feeling lost.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.556
I tried to kill myself.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.752
You... You...

22:56.120 --> 22:58.555
Hm. Dad didn't mention that.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.030
Oh. Really?

23:01.800 --> 23:06.829
Three Fridays ago, Max told me that
he was in love with a girl named Nicole...

23:07.040 --> 23:08.997
...who works in traffic.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.439
- Julie...
- I thought for a while about what to do...

23:12.640 --> 23:15.712
...and ultimately, I decided...

23:17.120 --> 23:19.510
...to take a bunch of sleeping pills.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.795
I had them on hand
because I'm an insomniac.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.638
Like me.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.595
And millions of other Americans, yeah.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.997
What are you doing?

23:39.600 --> 23:43.389
I can't believe...
I can't believe you tried to kill yourself.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.877
Julie, you... You're precious.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.916
Listen, a lot of horrible things
have happened to me since you left.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.794
- Oh... Don't.
- This is just the incident you know about.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.116
Excuse me.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.952
- Could you guys take this outside?
- What, are you listening in?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.072
That is so Midwestern.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.316
Excuse me.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.876
Hey, you can't raise kids
in a bubble, man.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.959
I can enjoy my time with my kid
when it's my weekend.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.200
Your weekend? Maybe you should've
tried to stick it out with her mother...

24:16.400 --> 24:19.393
...instead of leaving
the second that your boner wilted.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.839
Let's go, Journey. Come on.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.918
Journey?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.469
- Ugh.
- Aw.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.632
That's sweet.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.236
I like that name.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.954
Oh, you would.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.593
It's a great band.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.870
He lays this one
right down the center of the fairway.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.476
- Unh!
- Oh.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.680
You went to Krupke's. I was wondering
where you went. You bring one for me?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.400
Nope.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.117
She's eating.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.352
Our child attempted
suicide and you didn't tell me?

25:01.600 --> 25:04.672
I didn't... I didn't even find out
till the day after, okay?

25:04.880 --> 25:07.714
And I was little more concerned with Julie
than Ricki.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.391
- You should've called and told me.
- I did. That's why you're here.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.354
I didn't realize that she was suicidal.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.233
I thought she was just depressed
because of Max leaving.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.591
Depressed?
No, I could've managed that.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.474
No, I'm...
Julie's always been a moody kid.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.990
I wouldn't have even bothered
to call you.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.236
Well, why not?

25:27.440 --> 25:30.080
Because, Linda,
you don't really give a damn.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.634
Yes, I do!

25:33.960 --> 25:36.395
You shut me out of this family.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.829
I shut you out?

25:38.040 --> 25:41.238
- Yup.
- You came back here from California...

25:41.440 --> 25:42.476
...if you recall...

25:42.720 --> 25:45.679
...with a chip on your shoulder.
You were shut down.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.473
- Well, I did come back.
- Well...

25:47.640 --> 25:50.553
- You had moved on.
- I had to move on.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.639
I wanted the kids to have a mother
who was there!

25:53.840 --> 25:56.196
- It was my dream, man.
- And stupid me.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.030
- I thought we were your dream.
- I can't have two dreams?

26:00.280 --> 26:04.115
- No. In fact, Linda, you can't.
- Hey, you guys are fighting.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.596
It's like the '80s all over again.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.757
Too bad Adam and Josh aren't here
to relive the trauma.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.754
- Oh, good grief. Oh.
- That's enough.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.313
Speaking of, uh, Josh and Adam, um...

26:17.520 --> 26:20.240
...I let both the boys know
that you came into town.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.874
Oh, g...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.959
- Do they wanna see me?
- Josh does.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.196
Adam doesn't.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.869
In fact,
they're up for dinner this evening.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.120
Josh is gonna bring his girlfriend, Emily.
They've gotten pretty close.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.439
- Mm. Is Adam bringing anybody?
- I...

26:38.400 --> 26:40.153
I don't think so.

26:41.040 --> 26:45.080
Well, I'll have all my kids in one room.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.678
- What a treat.
- Yeah.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.111
It should be really enjoyable.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.990
Hey, here's Ricki.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.839
Oh, tell her we love her.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.600
I gotta be careful with the L word.
She's gun shy.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.638
Oh, you'll get there.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.634
- Hey, babe.
- So, uh, my daughter, Julie...

27:06.840 --> 27:09.480
...she apparently, uh...

27:12.040 --> 27:14.430
She tried to kill herself
with sleeping pills.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.515
Oh, man.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.189
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Whoa.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.119
How is she?

27:23.800 --> 27:26.554
Oh, no, no, she's okay. She's okay.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.070
- But, uh...
- I don't know what to say.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.114
I mean, you know my son, Derek,
freaked out on acid...

27:32.320 --> 27:35.518
- ...but it was an accident.
- I blame myself.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.790
No way.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.356
Blame that punk that cheated on her.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.270
You got on the plane to Indiana
to be by her side. You're a great mom.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
Oh...

27:44.680 --> 27:47.798
I'm seeing my boys tonight.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.400
Oh, that's great.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.915
Enjoy it, okay?

27:51.120 --> 27:53.510
I'm scared. I'm just...

27:53.920 --> 27:57.709
- They're all grown up now.
- No.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.834
No, you grow them, you know them.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.397
They're the same kids whose diapers
you changed way back when.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.310
Enjoy it.

28:07.520 --> 28:12.231
- Mr. Brummel, it's nice to see you.
- Hi, Mabel. Nice to see you.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.870
- Thanks for squeezing us in.
- Anytime.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.152
- Your party is waiting. Yup, follow me.
- Oh, okay.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.477
Five minutes late.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.040
Yeah. So now we have to...

28:38.200 --> 28:40.078
Here she comes.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.836
Oh, boy.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.517
Josh. Hey.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.519
- Hi, Mom.
- Aw.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.033
Josh.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.277
- This is my girlfriend, Emily.
- Hi.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.870
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Linda.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.720
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey. That's Ricki Rendazzo.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.350
You're in the presence of greatness.
Don't forget.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.920
Heh. Adam.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.430
You look so handsome, sweetie.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.717
Oh, thanks, Mom.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.389
Why don't you take that seat?
We can flank them.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.634
- Good to see you. Sorry we're late.
- Yeah, you are.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.877
Nice to see you're so punctual.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.230
It's okay.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.632
Can I get you some drinks?
Would you like another martini?

29:22.840 --> 29:24.991
Yeah. Why not? Keep them coming.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.471
- I'll just have water.
- Me too, water.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.838
With Scotch.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.313
So, um...

29:46.200 --> 29:47.793
How is Maureen's father doing?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.670
Oh, not well at all.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.909
No, the disease is progressing
more rapidly than they'd anticipated.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.077
So you've met Maureen?

29:56.280 --> 29:57.680
Yeah, of course.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.473
Lots of times. Heh, heh.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.796
Mo's great.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.276
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's...

30:03.480 --> 30:06.917
Emily and I have been together
for almost two years.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.919
- She's met the whole family.
- Yup.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.114
- Yeah.
- Em, why aren't you wearing your ring?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.512
Your engagement ring.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.876
You two are engaged?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.600
Yes.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.115
- Yup.
- Yeah.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.516
Josh got Emily
this conflict-free diamond.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.036
He proposed at the lake.
We were all there.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.720
It was beyond gay.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.474
- It was lovely. It was lovely.
- I'm happy for you.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.314
So happy for you, honey.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.553
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.879
Well, we, uh, wanted to keep
things quiet for a while...

30:46.080 --> 30:50.552
- ...so we could enjoy the news privately.
- Oh.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.195
But Julie said everybody
was at the proposal.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.232
Did this just happen?

30:55.440 --> 30:57.557
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No. No, it was...

30:57.760 --> 30:59.672
- No. It was July 4th.
- Yeah.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.599
So that was months.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.194
Months ago.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.791
We all know you're going through
something, but you're cray-cray.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.834
We were planning on
telling you tonight in person.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.633
Because I hadn't met you and...

31:13.840 --> 31:18.039
Why don't you be honest and tell Mom
that you don't want her at the wedding?

31:21.120 --> 31:24.158
Would you be interested
in hearing our appetizer specials?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.039
- Yes.
- No.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.556
We're practically eloping, Mom.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.515
Yeah, it's gonna be very small,
very green.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.952
Not gonna be a big, formal wedding
like the one Julie had.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.272
- Thanks for referencing that.
- Yeah, well, thanks for this.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.314
I'm still having Ambien shits
from my suicide attempt.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.638
- You wanna talk about my wedding?
- It's okay. Go ahead.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.112
You know, it won't hurt my feelings
if you decide to elope.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.834
Your dad and I eloped.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.839
- It was great.
- Yes, it was.

31:54.520 --> 31:58.070
Yeah. So, anyway,
this is wonderful, wonderful news.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.953
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.437
Hey, Adam, when are you gonna
settle down and get married?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.359
Who wants some appetizers?

32:05.560 --> 32:08.712
- Mom, I'm gay, as you know.
- You used to love the carpaccio.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.355
And unfortunately...

32:10.560 --> 32:13.473
...many of my fellow gay men
still can't get married.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.991
Well, I didn't mean to a man
necessarily.

32:17.240 --> 32:21.029
- Who would I marry, then?
- Well, I thought you were bisexual.

32:21.240 --> 32:25.120
That was my cover story in college,
like, 10 years ago.

32:25.320 --> 32:29.633
I'm really sorry that you didn't stay
updated on my sexuality...

32:29.880 --> 32:33.874
...but then again, you didn't stay updated
on much of anything. Am I right?

32:34.080 --> 32:38.233
Okay. Okay. Now that I know that you
decided to say you're completely gay...

32:38.440 --> 32:42.150
- "Decided"? You are such a homophobe.
- ...I won't ask about it again.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.990
This is what she does. She costumes
herself as this edgy rocker...

32:46.200 --> 32:48.510
...who's cooler
than the other PTA moms...

32:48.720 --> 32:51.713
...when in fact,
she voted for George W. Bush twice.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.274
I support our troops.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.790
And I'm the one
with the questionable lifestyle.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.112
Huh? Meanwhile, she's running around
calling herself Ricki.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.994
Well, that's a name, not a lifestyle.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.759
I was born gay.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.117
I was born Ricki.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.439
Touché.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.394
This shit-show is making my day.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.718
Is this whole thing a plea for attention
as per usual...

33:15.920 --> 33:18.151
...or are you actually a psychotic bitch?

33:18.360 --> 33:21.398
Hey, don't you dare call your sister
psychotic!

33:24.640 --> 33:27.838
Oh, my God, she's parenting.
Someone get a camera.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.794
Just cool it. This...

33:31.160 --> 33:33.311
Let's... Look.

33:33.720 --> 33:38.840
It's a very rare occasion
that we all get together like this.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.713
Your mother's here, right?

33:41.120 --> 33:44.796
I mean, I know...
I know we've always had...

33:45.040 --> 33:48.033
...some, you know,
issues and personality conflicts...

33:48.240 --> 33:50.675
- ...but what family hasn't?
- Yeah.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.640
But we are a family, still.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.351
You know, let's... We can put
all that crap behind us, can't we?

33:57.560 --> 34:00.997
And just appreciate the proximity.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.791
I mean, at this moment,
the Brummel family and family-to-be...

34:05.000 --> 34:07.560
...is proximal.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.480
That's special in itself, isn't it?

34:10.679 --> 34:11.830
Thank you.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.554
I would get a bottle of champagne
for the whole table.

34:15.960 --> 34:20.112
- No, but that's...
- But I just filed for bankruptcy.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.072
Describe to me how it makes you...

34:22.280 --> 34:24.158
Well, doc...

34:24.360 --> 34:26.112
And thank you for asking.

34:26.320 --> 34:30.438
It's not that I feel unbreakable
or even impenetrable.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.994
It's just...

34:32.199 --> 34:35.112
What is it? Come on, Angelo.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.994
This is a major breakthrough here.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.518
There is a wonderful,
old Italian joke about a poor man...

35:05.720 --> 35:06.836
You're still here?

35:07.880 --> 35:09.678
Hey.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.709
What are we gonna do today?

35:18.320 --> 35:20.152
I have therapy at noon...

35:20.360 --> 35:24.320
...so I gotta go wash my dick...

35:24.520 --> 35:27.319
...or I'll get another lecture
in personal care.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.870
Why don't you skip therapy?

35:30.080 --> 35:31.673
Just today.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.075
Call in sick.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.474
I am sick.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.752
That's why I'm in therapy.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.600
I mean, how often am I here? Heh.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.393
Never?

35:49.440 --> 35:50.840
Honestly.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.431
It's just a shampoo and trim.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.792
You have really good hair.
You should, like, brush it.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.992
She has my hair.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.157
Ow! Unh!

36:01.720 --> 36:05.111
Not more than half an inch.
I can feel how much you're cutting.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.880
Why are we so attached to our hair?

36:08.080 --> 36:11.357
Someday you're gonna find a gray hair,
and I don't mean on your head.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.754
No one wants to hear
about your steel wool, Mom.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.877
I look like Nosferatu.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.794
Oh, don't worry, they file them down.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.714
That's 190 on the card
and you can add whatever tip.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.600
Let's leave a nice, big one, shall we?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.154
Hey.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.835
Hey.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.831
You look very nice.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.319
Well... How?

37:11.040 --> 37:14.272
I just made a suggestion, you know?

37:15.320 --> 37:17.437
- She listens to me.
- Huh.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.353
I was a bit of a jerk yesterday.
I'm sorry about that.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.950
The market had... The...

37:25.160 --> 37:28.119
Things have been really stressful
at the company.

37:28.320 --> 37:32.280
Yeah, well, you work very hard.
I admire that.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.795
- You do?
- Yeah.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.789
You used to call me
an uptight workaholic.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.275
Yeah, honey.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.433
- I used to call you a lot of things.
- Heh, heh.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.751
But I changed, Pete.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.996
I have.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.513
I see that.

37:48.720 --> 37:53.158
I mean, I've been trying to get her
to change her clothes for days.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.637
Well, sometimes a girl
just needs her mother.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.713
I guess so.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.199
- Here we go. Taste it.
- They changed it a little.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.119
No, no, it's the same taste.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.313
- It's... Why would they change it?
- No. I don't know why.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.671
- Holy shit.
- It's a recipe that has...

38:11.880 --> 38:13.712
Oh, my God.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.032
- What?
- Nicole from traffic. This is her car.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.118
But you can't be sure.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.589
No, I know.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.952
She's got
these stupid stick figure thing...

38:28.640 --> 38:29.915
Oh, baby.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.240
Oh, she added Max. Oh, my God.

38:33.680 --> 38:37.720
- Let's not vandalize the car. Come on.
- Hey, hey! Let's just go home, all right?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.553
Let's go home.

No, a heart isn't something
that's like a steak, you know, that spoils.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.676
A heart is like a Big Mac.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.349
It just sits and sits and sits.

40:38.560 --> 40:41.712
It gets older, yeah,
but it doesn't change.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.431

a Big Mac never goes bad?

40:45.640 --> 40:48.155
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.592
- Interesting.
- It lives forever.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.832
I saw it on 60 Minutes.

40:54.040 --> 40:58.193
- That's disgusting.

A coworker gave it to me
for my migraines.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.789
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- Which I still get from time to time.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.191
And it's in the freezer
because I read...

41:26.400 --> 41:28.631
...that helps it maintain its potency.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.397
- Yup.
- Oh, my God.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.076
Look.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.159
- Do you think it would still fit me?
- Oh, yeah.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.155
- Should I try it on?
- Yeah.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.718
Okay, goodbye.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.877
Hey, where are you going?

45:18.080 --> 45:20.675
- Bathroom.
- Yeah.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.111
Don't kill yourself in there.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.277
- Pete. Oh, I can't believe it.
- I didn't say that.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.160
- She didn't hear you.
- Can't believe I said that.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.396
Oh, my God.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.354
And you notice, it smells nice.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.313
- It does.
- She's gotta be here.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.079
Julie?

45:45.520 --> 45:46.556
There she is.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.160
- Come on, sit down.
- No.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.314
You're tired.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.190
- I'm not a bit tired.
- Out.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.716
See?

45:58.920 --> 46:01.754
You know that little thing
you gave me about Napoleon?

46:01.960 --> 46:03.952
- No, what?
- By Robert G. Ingersoll?

46:04.120 --> 46:06.077
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm not sure I get that.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.999
Are you hungry?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.673
Are you hungry?

46:11.880 --> 46:13.678
You stay right there.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.240
Arugula.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.477
Nine-four-eight-eight-four.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.277
You just know that
off the top of your...?

46:23.480 --> 46:25.597
- Boom.
- Is it...?

46:27.240 --> 46:29.277
Yes, you are absolutely right.

46:29.480 --> 46:30.800
Of course I'm right.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.276
I know all the PLU codes.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.995
I ring stuff up all day long.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.196
Hm.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.831
Go ahead, try me.
Anything, anything, anything.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.839
- Bananas.
- Organic or regular?

46:43.040 --> 46:46.317
Organic is nine-four-two-three-seven.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.440
Yes.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.597
You're like a memorizing genius.

46:54.280 --> 46:55.714
Yes.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.357
You know, they say, like...

47:00.720 --> 47:03.758

47:04.000 --> 47:10.349
It's the air or the radio waves

47:10.560 --> 47:13.155

the one...

47:13.360 --> 47:15.795
What was his name?
Fa... Dr. Fa... Farling.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.515
Fena... Fenamana.
Fenan... Fenan.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.998
The guy in Wheaton.
What about him?

47:22.200 --> 47:25.318
That doctor. Remember,
he said Joshy was hyperactive.

47:25.520 --> 47:28.752
Turns out he was just drinking
too much pop.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.873
- Pop, yeah.
- Right?

47:32.480 --> 47:35.359
They know nothing.

47:35.560 --> 47:39.440
Yeah, they know nothing.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.840
We know nothing.

50:21.360 --> 50:22.555
Hi, Maureen.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.672
Oh, hi. Hi, there.

50:24.880 --> 50:29.079
Well, you're just in time for Maureen's
famous brioche French toast.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.640
How's your dad?

50:33.880 --> 50:35.439
I thought you were in Seattle.

50:35.640 --> 50:39.953
Oh, yeah, well, thanks for asking.
Dad's plateaued at the moment...

50:40.160 --> 50:43.278
...and so they said I should come back
for the time being...

50:43.480 --> 50:45.915
...and I didn't wanna be away
from my family.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.196
Mo, uh... Mo makes the best breakfasts.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.796
Oh, yes, that is all I'm good for, right?

50:53.000 --> 50:54.593
- No, I didn't mean to say that.
- Mm-hm.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.678
So, anyway, I, uh...

50:56.880 --> 50:59.873
I thought I would just take
the red-eye back last night...

51:00.080 --> 51:03.312
...and I got in at 6 this morning.
I feel like a hot mess.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.479
- You don't look like a hot mess.
- Ha-ha-ha.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.474
Linda, you're sweet.
Do you, uh...? You want some coffee?

51:10.520 --> 51:12.477
Uh, Mo makes, really, the best coffee.

51:12.680 --> 51:14.672
Thought her French toast
was the best.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.435
Hard to decide what's best
when Mo's cooking.

51:19.040 --> 51:21.396
Come on, Linda. Sit down.
Have some breakfast.

51:21.640 --> 51:25.350
No, I'm good, thanks.
I'm not really hungry. Ha, ha.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.193
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.915
Okay, well, suit yourself.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.589
By the way, you look good in my robe.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.715
Keep it.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.116
Okay.

51:38.600 --> 51:42.310
I'm gonna go out
and make a little phone call.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.957
Okay. Come on, you guys,
let's eat before it gets cold.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.680
- Okay. Uh, syrup?
- No, I have it.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.314
- Can I start?
- After you.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.715
Hi.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.632
Can we talk?

51:57.080 --> 51:58.753
I'm practically naked right now.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.794
I have five sisters.
I've seen a naked lady before.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.559
Well, I just had a brother.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.238
Killed in Nam.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.715
Oh, I didn't know.

52:10.720 --> 52:15.476
So as you know,
we're really concerned about Miss Julie.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.751
She's gonna be all right, you know?

52:17.960 --> 52:20.998
- She's always been a fighter. Heh, heh.
- Well, she's had to be.

52:22.240 --> 52:25.551
Uh, right now, we are working
with her doctor to stabilize her...

52:25.760 --> 52:30.471
...and she's on some meds
and she's been going to therapy as well.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.912
I don't like her to miss a session.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.589
Oh. I don't think one's that big a deal.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.230
I also understand
you gave her some marijuana.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.796
No. Pete did.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.320
It's Pete's marijuana.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.117
For his headaches.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.992
Yeah, we did smoke some. It's a plant.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.600
Okay.

52:52.800 --> 52:56.077
I just think that maybe it's not great
for you to be here now.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.112
You're always welcome
in our home.

52:58.360 --> 53:01.831
And I know Pete thought
it would do Julie some good to see you...

53:02.040 --> 53:05.670
...but I think what she needs right now
is normalcy.

53:05.880 --> 53:11.194
Well, I got her out of those pajamas
and I got her hair done.

53:11.400 --> 53:16.350
And I think she's doing a lot better
since I arrived.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.916
Linda, hey, come on, please.

53:19.120 --> 53:22.955
Please, don't be offended.
I'm just looking out for my kid.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.960
Your kid?

53:26.160 --> 53:28.277
Yeah, she's your kid too, of course.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.996
But, Linda, come on.
Let's... Let's be real.

53:32.200 --> 53:35.034
You haven't lived with her
since she was a little girl.

53:35.240 --> 53:37.709
I was there
for the teen years and college.

53:37.920 --> 53:40.230
She went to college in Milwaukee!

53:40.480 --> 53:43.439
Yeah, and who do you think
drove her ass there?

53:45.000 --> 53:48.152
Who do you think helped her
put together her dorm furniture?

53:48.360 --> 53:50.670
Or paid her bail
when she got that DUI...

53:50.880 --> 53:55.716
...or went to the mother-daughter tea
at that God-awful white sorority, huh?

53:55.960 --> 53:58.873
Who do you think's
been doing all the mom stuff?

53:59.520 --> 54:04.231
Look, Linda, I respect you
as the woman who gave her life.

54:04.440 --> 54:07.638
But after you went to L.A.,
Christmas visits didn't cut it.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.760
There was a hole in this family
and I filled it.

54:10.960 --> 54:12.838
No, no, no.

54:13.040 --> 54:18.991
I tried to come out here to see them more,
but you always made it so difficult.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.637
"Oh, this isn't a good time
because we're doing SAT prep."

54:22.840 --> 54:26.436
Or, "Joshy has an away game."
Or... Yes, yes, you did.

54:26.640 --> 54:30.600
You alienated my children from me,
Maureen. You poisoned the relationship!

54:30.800 --> 54:32.200
Are you serious right now?

54:32.400 --> 54:34.232
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.590
Really?

54:35.800 --> 54:39.635
You know all those birthday and
Mother's Day gifts you got from the kids?

54:40.400 --> 54:42.073
I paid for those.

54:42.480 --> 54:46.394
I sent them. I'm the one who made sure
they didn't forget about you...

54:46.600 --> 54:48.193
...though they had reason to.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.676
You should be kissing my feet
right now.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.917
Bullshit!

54:56.400 --> 54:58.039
Well...

55:00.920 --> 55:04.994
- I didn't want it to go like this.
- Well, that's how it's going.

55:10.680 --> 55:13.673
Do you need help
paying for a flight back?

55:14.600 --> 55:16.432
You wish.

55:18.680 --> 55:20.239
Hey.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.480
Pete's still in love with me.

55:30.720 --> 55:33.235
I'm gonna let you have that.

56:11.160 --> 56:14.232
- I couldn't find Julie.
- Oh, okay.

56:14.440 --> 56:17.000
Shuttles aren't so bad.
It's like sharing a taxi.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.556
Yeah, it's great.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.634
Thanks for, uh, calling.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.957
It was nice to see you.

56:34.320 --> 56:39.111
Ultimately, I think it was good
that you came.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.471
Yeah, it was a real...

56:43.160 --> 56:44.480
Uh, fly safely.

56:44.680 --> 56:47.400
I have no control over that.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.672
- No.
- Wait.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.871
Okay. Later.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.594

He's got seven children by four
different women. Do you believe that?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.431
Get it, Mick! Ow!

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.910
Yeah. Yeah, busy guy, right?

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.190
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.839
Of course, he didn't raise those kids.
He's a rock star.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.156
And more importantly,
he's not the mother.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.598
Daddy can do whatever Daddy wants.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.116
Daddy can go make love
with whoever he wants.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.636
He can take risks.
He can get hooked on drugs.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.593
He can leave and...

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.998
Who cares? Some people get hurt.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.590
As long as you get some great songs
out of it. Ha, ha.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.634
Okay. Let's hear
some of those great songs right now.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.234
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.600
Hey, by the way, though,
your kids will still respect...

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.832
...and they'll love you
because you're the man!

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.718
- You know what I'm talking about, girls?
- Yeah.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.877
But if you're a woman, mm-mm.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.319
God forbid you should forget
one school concert or you...

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.590
Or a wedding or...

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.591
Or you forget to be the tooth fairy
one time because you had a gig.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.629
Congratulations, you're a monster.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.876
Okay, Ricki, I think that's enough.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.630
You're scaring some guys here.
I felt my balls suck up into my body.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.800
Ow!

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.152
You didn't need them anyway, Greg.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.234
Ooh.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.194
Yes, I actually do, Linda.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.639
What did...? Excuse me?

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.390
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let's keep it tight, people. Come on.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.240
Oh, yeah.
You're right, you're right, Buster.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.999
What do we got up next?

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.112
We got Pink.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.517

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.873
It's been a difficult week.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.238
It's been a difficult few years,
but I still love you.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.312
I can't say that?
Do I ever get to say that?

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.400
- Do you love me?
- Of course, I love you. Of course, I do.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.152
- And I love Buster and I love Joey.
- Oh.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.957
I don't mean do you love me like
Wendy loves the goddamn Lost Boys.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.560

What do you...? What? I don't get...

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.120
I'm old, I'm broke, I can't cook
a decent meal, I'm getting fat.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.479
Why would you love a ruined person
who ruins other people, kids?

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.396
Is that it? You think because you screwed
up once, you don't get a second chance?

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.440
I cheated on my first wife...

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.395
...with a stripper who was addicted
to codeine cough syrup.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.512
My kids didn't forgive me.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.995
They're still mad.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.078

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.276
Doesn't matter if your kids love you.
It's not their job to love you.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.156
It's your job to love them.
That's why you were put here.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.951
That's why you're their mom.
That's why I'm my kids' dad.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.634
I love my kids so much.

I look absurd.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.959
I'm sure you look gorgeous.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.470
I look like my mother.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.673
Well, that's not possible.
Your mother's dead.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.359
Oh, you look beautiful.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.598
Come on,
that is the most amazing blue.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.231
Looks like Roger Daltrey's eyes
from Tommy.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.552
- Thanks.
- Are you finished with these?

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.592
Yeah. Do you have anything black?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.871
- Black?
- We'll take this one.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.029
Okay. It looks nice.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.636
How do you know these TSA scanners
aren't government mind control?

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.073
These days, nothing would surprise me.
See they made me take my toe ring off?

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.160
I can't believe that woman, Janet,
made me take the tequila out of my bag.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.596
That was Cabo Wabo,
Sammy Hagar's recipe.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.680
- Does he look like a terrorist to you?
- Told you, you can't bring liquids.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.951

Can't do what?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.438
I can't go to this wedding.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.751
Big mistake.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.838
Gotta call Buster,
tell him we're heading back to L.A.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.875
No way. Come on,
you're the mother of the groom.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.880
There's no understudy, sweetheart.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.115
I'm so scared.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.636
Wow.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.156
- Hi, I'm Bodhi.
- Hey, Bodhi.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.079
- Hi.
- Thank you for coming.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.034
You can pick up
your table number here.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.755
These are bags for the birdseed toss.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.113
Also, Emily and Josh request
that you turn off your cell phones.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.673
Well, I would, but the phone company
beat me to it. Ha-ha-ha.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.958
- We take these, right?
- Yes, that's for you.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.670
Would you like a cocktail
before the ceremony?

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.069
What are these?

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.320
This one's called The Josh.
It's ginger beer and small-batch whiskey.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.958
And this one is The Emily.
It's kind of a playful take on a Kir Royal.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.834
- For free?
- Yes.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:12.990
- I probably shouldn't.
- I think me and my small-batch whiskey...

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.352
...are gonna go try and find
the little boy's room. You okay?

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.195
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.679
Linda.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.997
- Linda. Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh, hi.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.316
Oma.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.591
- How are you?
- Oh.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.076
Oh, I like you, you know?

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.670
Even though you ran off on my son.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.397
- Oh. I always liked you too, Oma.
- Ha, ha. Between you and me...

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.751
...I don't like Peter's new wife.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.274
Peter and Maureen are happy.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.637
Maybe now.
It's only been a few weeks.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.311
- No, it's been many, many years.
- Oh?

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.196
I've been looking for you.
Why don't we go find our seat, okay?

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.036
Jeff. Will you show Oma to her seat?

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.158
Thanks. Jeff will take you.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.793
- Take care.
- Hi, Oma.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.191
Come on, let's go sit down.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.989
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.390
Hi.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.071
I'm very busy right now, so I...

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.120
Yeah, sure. Big... Huge day for you.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.951
But we'll, uh... Yeah.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.476
Oma, are you comfortable?

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.353
- Thanks. Thank you.
- That's her.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.596
That's Linda.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.996
She's not even sitting with the family.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.671
So here we are, gathered here.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.720
This big tree over us
and the roots beneath us.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.154
I can't think of a better place to do this
than out here in Mother Nature.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.596
And now we can open
the wedding ceremony.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.720
Go ahead.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.630
Oh. Don't. Don't. Don't run away.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.917
Walk on.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.797
Mom. I'm so glad you're here.
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.319
- Yeah. Greg pawned his Gibson SG.
- Oh.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.079
- Hi, Josh.
- Hey.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.272
- Wow. Heh.
- Yeah.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.558
Well, we got your RSVPs so late.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.032
We couldn't really move things around
with the hall...

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.631
...so, um, I hope you guys
don't mind sitting with Emily's cousins...

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.991
- ...and, like, our harpist. Heh, heh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.839
No, not at all.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.918
We'd love to learn some harp licks.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.873
Okay, bye.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.550
Yeah, bye.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.400
It really means a lot to me
that you came, Mom.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.916
Hi, we're the Bremen Quintet.
Congratulations, Josh and Emily.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160
Bye.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.516
- Congratulations.
- Hi.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.674
So whatever table we're at,
that's the cool table...

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.718
- ...okay?
- Oh, yeah.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.634
Ooh. There's Adam.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.632
He's a sharp dresser.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.433
- Come on, go say hi.
- Mm...

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.279
Come on.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.114
Adam.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.915
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.196
- Um, Desmond, this is my mother, Linda.
- A pleasure.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.995
- Hi.
- I see where Adam gets his cheekbones.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.676
We are seeing each other.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.032
Oh, that's... That's wonderful.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.120
Thanks.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.956
Adam, I'm so glad you met someone.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.512
Particularly someone so handsome.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.589
- This is Greg, my boyfriend.
- Adam.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.154
- Hello.
- Desmond, hey.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.314
- Nice to meet you. Oh, groovy tie, Greg.
- Heh-heh-heh.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.996
You're probably too young for this,
but have you heard of Bruce Lee?

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.191
Of course I've heard of Bruce Lee.
He's the man.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.995
Yeah, you look just like him.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.429
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.710
Not even a little.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.189
You're not even Chinese.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.393
Bruce Lee wasn't Chinese.
He was born in San Francisco.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.559
- Mm-hm.
- Huh. Oh.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.995
Hope you have a nice time
and enjoy your vegan meal.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.919
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.112
I'm a team member at Total Foods.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.670
- Oh, I love Total Foods.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.759
All you boys do. Ha-ha-ha.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.832
Okay, she has got to be
heavily medicated.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.191
I like her.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.074
Cut.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.634
Yeah!

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.755
Here we go.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.675
Aw.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.031
And how did you meet the groom?

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.271
Oh. Caesarean section.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.591
Budapest, actually.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.190
Yeah. It's gonna be, like, I don't know...

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.319
- We need to... We need to go.
- Okay.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.672
All right, folks.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.715
- Pete, it... It's time.
- Oh.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.275
Your toast.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.113
Hm. Well, um...

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.196
Good luck.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.840
Well...

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.553
All right, speech.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.595
Thanks.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.111
Hello, everybody. Ahem.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.592
Yeah. Hi.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.759
I'm, uh...

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.670
I'm Rick... I'm, heh, Linda Brummel,
mother of the groom.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.596
And I remember some of you
from years ago.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.678
And it's nice to see...

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.720
Nice to see you again.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.391
Um, yeah, at first I didn't know...

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.955
Whoo. Heh, heh.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.360
What to give Josh and Emily,
you know, as a gift.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.232
Not only because I don't have
any money, heh, heh, but...

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.992
But, ahem, also because there's so much
I haven't given them.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.870
I was never a traditional mom, right?
Ha-ha-ha.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.033
Um, so I won't be
a traditional mother-in-law.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.630
I hope. Ha-ha-ha.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.159
So I realized the only thing I have to give
Josh and Emily is the only thing I...

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.717
I have to give anyone.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.958
I was never much of a housekeeper...

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.677
...or a cook. Ha, ha. Right?
Ha-ha-ha.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.833
But I am a musician, you know?

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.036
That's all I am.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:03.479
And that's what I have to give,
so I would like to give all I have to my...

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.919
My son and his beautiful wife...

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.629
...right now.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.480
Boys, you can come out.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.313
Oh. I wanna thank
my children's other mother...

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.110
...for everything.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.794
- Oh, God.
- What happened?

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.156
It's okay.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.997
Josh, who are they?

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.795
I think that's The Flash.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.032
I usually have a way cooler guitar.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.157
This is a tune by Bruce Springsteen.

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:45.793
And this is for Josh and Emily.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.679
One, two.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.799
- I'm just gonna...
- No.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.996
