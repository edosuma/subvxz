Hi.

This is jeff;
jeff strongman.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.707
So what happened
between you and your girl?

00:08.709 --> 00:11.577
She wanted to get married and
I'm just not sure I'm ready.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.245
It's the same reason
I lost lyndsey.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.947
It's like we were
dating the same woman.

00:14.949 --> 00:17.583
I am gonna ask lyndsey
to marry me.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.718
Lyndsey macelroy...

00:19.720 --> 00:20.953
Will you marry me?

00:20.955 --> 00:22.988
Yes! I will marry you!

00:22.990 --> 00:25.224
Everything you need to know
is right in here.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.627

a billion dollar idea--

00:28.629 --> 00:30.062
Thought controlled computing.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.430
We have so much work to do

00:31.432 --> 00:33.399
And all I can think about
is you and me-- wow...

00:33.401 --> 00:35.034
Gotta stop thinking about sex.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.635

saying--

00:38.472 --> 00:41.140

just read his thoughts!

00:49.717 --> 00:51.316
And a great bottle

00:51.318 --> 00:53.852
Uh, uh, technically
it's french canadian.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.754
Uh, it's called
"two-buck canuck,"

I mean, you know, there's
no rush to start a family.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.414
I mean, after all, uh,

01:22.416 --> 01:24.716
Lyndsey's well beyond
her child-bearing age.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.187
Well, we have talked about
adopting a baby from china.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.389
Oh!
Course, then we'd
have to teach it english,

01:30.391 --> 01:32.458
Which seems like a lot of work.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.027
Would you mind
getting desert, sweetie?

01:35.029 --> 01:37.062
Sure.

01:38.398 --> 01:39.398

02:00.354 --> 02:02.421
Why the hell are you here?

02:02.423 --> 02:03.555
Larry asked me to dinner.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.124
What was I supposed to say?

02:05.126 --> 02:06.825
That you couldn't come.
That you had to work.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.327
That you're not really
jeff strongman

02:08.329 --> 02:10.162
And your entire friendship
is a lie.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.197
That I had to work--
that's a good one.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.233
(sighs)

02:14.235 --> 02:17.703
Alan, this wedding
is very important to me.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.705
If you still have
any feelings for me at all,

02:19.707 --> 02:21.540
You will let me have this day.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.674
Fine.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.743
I shan't go.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.245
(sighs)

02:26.247 --> 02:27.613
But good luck getting
the chicken dance

02:27.615 --> 02:29.014
Started without me.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.318
Hey, jeff, you want
a piece of lyndsey's pie?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.687
There's no way
I can eat it all myself.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.189
I don't know.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.824
Last time I had some,
there was a hair in it.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.594
Jeff was actually just saying
that he's got to get going.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.129
Mm.
Really? Oh.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.531
Well, then I'll
make this quick.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.267
I know we haven't known
each other for a long time,

02:48.269 --> 02:50.102
But I feel like
we share a lot.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.870
M-more than you know.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.039
So I was wondering
if you'd do me the honor

02:54.041 --> 02:55.240

02:55.242 --> 02:56.775

03:05.419 --> 03:08.120
You sure? Don't you want to
take a moment to think about it?

03:08.122 --> 03:09.321
What is there
to think about?

03:09.323 --> 03:10.489
You know, you could
change my name from

03:10.491 --> 03:12.424
"jeff strongman",
to "jeff best man."

03:12.426 --> 03:13.759

03:13.761 --> 03:15.460
That's the kind of stuff
I want in your toast!

Bachelor party.

Yeah. My brother's
letting me crash here.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.233
I told him it was just
for a couple days,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.735
But, between you and me,
it's a pretty sweet deal.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.304
Huh. I should try that.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.472
Part of me thinks

09:34.474 --> 09:35.774
I should just stay here
till he dies.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.642
Why stop there?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.611
Why not move in with
the next guy who buys the house?

09:39.613 --> 09:40.645
Yeah.

09:40.647 --> 09:41.780
So, uh, what do you do?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.448
I'm a vet.
I moved out here

I'm glad you're not one
of those people who thinks

17:13.466 --> 17:16.000
Every person they meet
is their soul mate. Or...

17:16.002 --> 17:18.403
That-that you would think
that we were moving in

17:18.405 --> 17:20.972
With each other
just 'cause we had sex.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.207
She's not a lesbian, dude.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.878
I gotta call the guy back.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.479
Go ahead.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.615
Good luck in san francisco.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.816
Thanks.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.555
All right.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.061
I'm sorry, buddy.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.962
I'm here for you.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.831
Appreciate that.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.068
You know, actually...

17:50.070 --> 17:53.071
What she's offering
is a pretty good deal, so...

17:53.073 --> 17:54.739
If you wanted to go with her...

17:54.741 --> 17:56.274

Well, um, there
isn't much to tell.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.551
I, um... I grew up
in chicago,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.886
I went to northwestern,
became a veterinarian,
mmm.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.889
Married the man of my dreams
but apparently he was dreaming

18:11.891 --> 18:14.425
Of banging
my best friend, so...

18:14.427 --> 18:15.626
How 'bout you?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.295
Uh, I haven't met
your best friend.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.763
Is she hot?

18:18.765 --> 18:22.100
You know I neuter dogs
for a living.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.574
Uh, just looking
for a fresh start.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.909
You know? I mean, out here,
I can be whoever I want to be.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.744
I can reinvent myself.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.146
Mm. I thought about doing that.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.282
But in the end, I can't be
anyone but jeff strongman.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.085
Well, I wouldn't mind
a strong man in the end.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.920
Ooh, dirty word play.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.355
I'm vibrating.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.556
I'm growing.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.392
No, uh...

18:48.394 --> 18:49.627
No, our-our table's ready.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.095
Oh, great, great.
Uh, well,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.798
Let's take our wine
and have a seat.
Yeah, or, um,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.533
You know, there's 20 minutes
left in happy hour.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.135
I mean, we could just stay here
and fill up

18:57.137 --> 18:59.170
On two-for-one appetizers
and half-off drinks.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.238
Yes!

19:01.406 --> 19:03.107
I mean, you know,
if that's what you want.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.310
It's just... I hate
spending money unnecessarily.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.347
Anything we don't finish
is going home with us.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.884

it's for the dogs, but...

Actually, I'm starting to think
alan harper is the problem.

I mean, jeff strongman
has a girlfriend, a best friend

20:07.240 --> 20:09.273
And he's practically debt-free.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.608
Practically?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.810
He may have received
a free credit card offer

20:12.812 --> 20:14.979
That was a little too good
to pass up.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.683
Jeff strongman has
a credit card?

20:18.685 --> 20:24.155
And get this, alan harper got
100 bucks for referring jeff.

20:27.726 --> 20:32.863
Now I just need to figure out
a way to get rid of alan harper.
