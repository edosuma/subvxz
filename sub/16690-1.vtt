WEBVTT

00:02.569 --> 00:04.071
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.137 --> 00:05.672
Chef Ramsay visits
the Spanish Pavillion.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.374
Just put it on
the  plate right now.

00:07.441 --> 00:08.475
Shut up!

00:08.542 --> 00:09.676
Get out of here!

00:09.676 --> 00:11.011
A New Jersey restaurant

00:11.077 --> 00:12.846
That specializes in
nightly battles.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.147
Give me three steaks!

00:14.214 --> 00:15.582
Like these three
right here!

00:15.582 --> 00:17.016
It's brother against brother

00:17.083 --> 00:18.818
in the main event.
I want you to listen to me.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.186
Agh!

00:20.186 --> 00:21.287
And a family business

00:21.354 --> 00:22.555
is on the line.

00:22.622 --> 00:25.191
It's not
the Spanish Pavillion.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.593
The kitchen has been neglected.

00:27.693 --> 00:28.828
Ugh.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.000
The food is a mess.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.163
The food is a mess.

00:30.229 --> 00:33.266
A dead lobster,
stuck at the bottom.

00:33.332 --> 00:34.467
And the staff is ready
to mutiny.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.335
I wanna see
all the  food out.

00:36.402 --> 00:37.603
- Out!
- Tonight...

00:37.670 --> 00:38.804
in one of the most
difficult challenges

00:38.871 --> 00:39.939
he's ever faced...

00:40.039 --> 00:41.507
Stop, stop!

00:41.574 --> 00:43.442
Chef Ramsay tries to save

00:43.509 --> 00:44.644
A family legacy...

00:44.710 --> 00:46.479
If your grandfather
sat at my table today,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.114
he'd be beating
the crap outta you.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.016
That is spiraling
out of control.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.817
Agh!

00:51.817 --> 00:53.519
That's tonight
on Kitchen Nightmares.

00:53.586 --> 00:55.354
Agh!
Get outta here!

00:55.421 --> 00:56.555
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:14.741 --> 01:16.109
Harrison, New Jersey

01:16.176 --> 01:17.677
is home to
the Spanish Pavillion,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.212
located a mile and a half

01:19.279 --> 01:22.015
from Newark's historic
iron bound neighborhood,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.852
an area highly populated
by Spanish restaurants.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.220
The Spanish Pavillion

01:27.287 --> 01:29.055
was opened by
a man ahead of his time--

01:29.122 --> 01:30.000
Antonio Fernandez.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.524
Antonio Fernandez.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.793
My grandfather was a pioneer in
the Spanish cuisine.

01:33.893 --> 01:36.029
He opened up in 1964.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.631
The first Spanish restaurant
in the state of New Jersey.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.367
Retired after ten years,
very successful.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.002
And then came
out of retirement

01:43.069 --> 01:45.405
to open the Spanish Pavillion
in 1976.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.942
Antonio finally retired
for good in 1996,

01:49.008 --> 01:50.810
leaving the successful
Spanish Pavillion

01:50.877 --> 01:52.312
to his daughter, Balbina,

01:52.378 --> 01:54.147
and her two sons,
Jerry and Michael.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.782
Table 11,
please, Ma.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.016
When we took over,

01:57.083 --> 01:58.985
the Spanish Pavillion
was the place to be.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.000
There was
a line out the door.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.820
There was
a line out the door.

02:00.887 --> 02:04.190
Five years later, everything
still runs down the tube.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.160
The customers complain.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.996
You see the same old menu,
the same old dishes.

02:10.063 --> 02:12.632
No flavors, bland.
No flavor?

02:12.699 --> 02:14.667
That sauce is good,
I don't care.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.803
We're like
a casual family restaurant,

02:16.870 --> 02:18.371
and we have to wear a tuxedo.

02:18.438 --> 02:21.107
And you're serving people
with shorts and T-shirts.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.675
It just doesn't match.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.778
Looks like you're
in a wedding party in 1973.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.620
Where's my brother?

02:37.557 --> 02:39.192
You gotta
be here more often.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.130
I'm dying to have a drink.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.733
My staff might complain
that I'm not here a lot.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.635
But as far as I'm concerned...

02:50.403 --> 02:52.372
Jerry doesn't do anything.

02:52.438 --> 02:53.940
So the mayor's
coming to pick up lunch?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.241
He's always on the phone,

02:55.308 --> 02:56.743
he's always this,
he's always that.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.212
I'm a councilman in my town.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.000
Tomorrow night
we'll celebrate victory,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.247
Tomorrow night
we'll celebrate victory,

03:01.314 --> 03:02.749
I smell it in here.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.050
And I am out of here more.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.852
But sometimes I
don't wanna be here enough,

03:05.919 --> 03:08.188
because Michael
can get a little tough.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.622
What the hell
happened to this?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.457
"A" with
the lobster bisque.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.493
Oh,!

03:13.560 --> 03:14.627
Screaming and yelling,

03:14.694 --> 03:15.795
and I guess
it kinda wears you out.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.363
You know, there's
a real easy solution

03:17.430 --> 03:18.531
for this  problem.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.233
Michael...
What?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.501
Stop it.
It's...

03:21.568 --> 03:23.536
Michael, stop it.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.038
Michael and Jerry
have a lot of differences,

03:25.104 --> 03:26.573
and I find
myself in the middle.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.341
I don't wanna hear
any more about the situation.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.676
That's too bad.

03:29.742 --> 03:30.000
My mother is
at this restaurant right now

03:30.000 --> 03:32.845
My mother is
at this restaurant right now

03:32.912 --> 03:33.780
just to make sure
that my brother and I

03:33.846 --> 03:34.914
do not kill each other.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.318
Nothing.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.520
This place
needs big-time help.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.188
I don't know what to do.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.858
On a Saturday night, maybe
I'll do 10, 15, 20 dinners.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.393
That's not paying the bills.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.229
I still haven't
even paid my fish guy.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.030
I gotta pay my fish guy.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.933
We're into debt over
$500,000 or $600,000.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.301
I'm scared.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.270
We can't support our families
in this business.

03:57.370 --> 04:00.000
So it's a stress.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.174
So it's a stress.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.710
I'll do anything
it takes to succeed.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.411
Spanish Pavillion is
all I got.

04:18.825 --> 04:19.959
Hello.
Hi.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.494
Hello.
How are you?

04:21.561 --> 04:23.263
Somebody die?

04:23.329 --> 04:24.631
Did somebody pass away?

04:24.697 --> 04:26.299
No. Why?
No?

04:26.366 --> 04:28.768
You all look immaculately
formal with the tuxedos.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.000
Undertakers
at a funeral.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.203
Undertakers
at a funeral.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.705
How old are those suits?

04:32.772 --> 04:33.906
They are beautiful!

04:33.973 --> 04:35.008
Huh?

04:35.074 --> 04:36.876
Made to measure.
thank you very much.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.211
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Wow, wow, wow.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.446
These guys are stuck
back in the '80s.

04:40.513 --> 04:41.581
They look
like little penguins,

04:41.648 --> 04:42.849
and they're
wobbling back and forth

04:42.915 --> 04:44.017
with their little--
you know, little tuxedos.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.451
Hi, how are you?

04:45.518 --> 04:46.552
Slightly underdressed,
my apologies.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.587
No, you're--
you're okay.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.921
I'm very nervous

04:48.988 --> 04:50.757
about Chef Ramsay coming
into the restaurant.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.293
I wasn't a fan of
this idea; Michael was.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.995
And I'm a little nervous.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.463
I'm the mom.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.531
Okay, great.
Sorry, first name, excuse me?

04:58.598 --> 05:00.000
Balbina.
Where's that from?

05:00.000 --> 05:00.500
Balbina.
Where's that from?

05:00.566 --> 05:01.834
From Spain.
Oh, wow.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.336
Would you like
to come to the table?

05:03.403 --> 05:05.004
I'd love to.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.707
This will be Joe,
he'll be your server.
Joe.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.242
Welcome
to Spanish Pavillion.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.376
I'm very happy to see
another unique tuxedo.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.878
Wow.
Thank you very much.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.079
You wear this
every day for lunch?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.280
Yes, lunch and dinner.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.516
Anyway...

05:16.582 --> 05:17.550
So when did
the Spanish Pavillion open?

05:17.617 --> 05:19.852
1976.
Wow.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.522
Take me back to what
it was like in its day.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.724
My grandfather
worked seven days a week.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.427
At 75, he would
jump behind the broiler,

05:27.493 --> 05:28.695
and do the meats.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.000
I mean, if he were
in his prime right now,

05:30.000 --> 05:30.063
I mean, if he were
in his prime right now,

05:30.129 --> 05:31.631
I know that he would be doing
a better job than we would.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.066
You're here five days?

05:33.132 --> 05:34.934
I'm out
a little more lately,

05:35.001 --> 05:37.303
because I was elected
as a committeeman in my town.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.938
Politician?
Yeah.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.239
I enjoy it, I really do.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.246
My brother and I
both went to

05:47.313 --> 05:49.282
Johnson & Wales University
for this.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.550
I work
the front of the house,

05:50.616 --> 05:51.951
my brother did more of
the culinary end.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.653
And he's
thechef de cuisine?

06:05.164 --> 06:07.233
He, um...well, I don't
know if he's the chef.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.502
But he's back there
quite a bit.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.436
Thank you.
I'll have a little eat.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.438
No problem.
Thank you.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.675
Listen, no playing
around right now.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.176
Oh, don't worry
about it.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.211
We're gonna nail this.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.946
Put your phone away.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.485
Oh, yes. Let's start off
with lobster bisque.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.786
Okay, sir.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.789
Um, I'll go for the, uh--
the, uh, marinara.

06:31.057 --> 06:31.991
Wonderful.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.528
Please. Lovely.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.430
In the beginning, when I walked
in, I thought it was a funeral.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.265
Now I'm in Spain.
You've got me back.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.333
Okay, brilliant.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.635
Yeah, I can't wait.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.641
I ain't hanging
my boys to dry, bud.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.144
I'm so confident
overseeing my guys

06:51.210 --> 06:52.545
that I got
nothing to worry about.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.847
These guys have been
by my side 15 years.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.883
Go, go, go, man, go.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.352
Let's see
what he thinks.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.000
It just looks
disgusting.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.587
It just looks
disgusting.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.391
It's very creamy.
Is it always this creamy?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.430
It just looks like the lobster
was dead before they cooked it.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.964
They're from...

07:12.031 --> 07:13.132
The lobster
is from the tank.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.700
You wanna take a look?

07:14.767 --> 07:16.569
Okay.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.971
Is he dead?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.273
No, I think
they're just sleeping.

07:20.339 --> 07:21.808
He must be dead.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.509
We keep
a good eye on them.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.211
You keep a good eye on them?
Surely not.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.980
He's  dead.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.000
A dead lobster!
No, he's gone.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.716
A dead lobster!
No, he's gone.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.218
Is he?
Ew.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.854
Ugh.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.756
What I'm concerned about is,
everything else in there,

07:36.823 --> 07:38.524
they've been
feeding off that lobster.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.392
Yes.
And they've become

07:39.459 --> 07:40.726
full of bacteria.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.530
That is extremely
unacceptable.

07:44.597 --> 07:45.698
Dangerous.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.733
People could get
extremely sick with that.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.335
I'll get rid of this
right now.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.169
Okay, good.
Please...

07:50.236 --> 07:51.737
Can you take that?

07:51.804 --> 07:54.307
All right.
Love you, bye.

07:59.912 --> 08:00.000
It don't smell.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.581
It don't smell.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.282
That lobster's fresh.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.184
Even though it died,
it's...good.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.321
Hey, Michael.
Are you good?

08:08.387 --> 08:09.555
Good, I'm doing fine.

08:09.622 --> 08:10.623
Thank you.
Yeah, good.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.525
I know you
saw a lobster in there

08:12.592 --> 08:14.126
that passed away.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.761
Well, I try to--we try
to check that every day.

08:15.862 --> 08:16.829
I was just
slightly concerned

08:16.896 --> 08:18.130
to see the dead
lobsters in there...

08:18.197 --> 08:19.499
I try to freeze them
right away,

08:19.565 --> 08:20.766
and then I make
the bisque from that.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.201
You must be busy.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.236
Thank you, enjoy.

08:23.302 --> 08:24.303
Thank you.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.105
Okay.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.000
Uh, what is all that there,
the grease?

08:30.000 --> 08:30.676
Uh, what is all that there,
the grease?

08:30.743 --> 08:32.111
Olive oil, garlic.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.312
Can I have a little bowl to just
drain some of that out?

08:33.379 --> 08:34.814
It's like they're swimming.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.782
Thank you.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.084
Ooh, dear.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.552
It's like the
Exxon Valdez there.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.087
Too much olive oil
for you?

08:41.153 --> 08:44.724
You think there's
too much olive oil in there?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.759
It's like a heart attack
waiting to happen.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.160
I hope there's
a hospital nearby.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.665
The chicken tastes

08:52.732 --> 08:54.567
absolutely dreadful.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.502
I just want you
to taste the chicken.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.905
Just taste that.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.000
It's a little--
it's dry.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.673
It's a little--
it's dry.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.174
You sound
like a politician now.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.176
Okay, I'm
not  around.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.212
That's gross.
Do me a favor.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.947
Can you ask your brother
to taste that?

09:08.014 --> 09:08.881
Yeah.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.387
He wants you
to try this.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.889
What--what's
the next dish?

09:16.956 --> 09:18.157
Paella?
Send the paella.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.460
The paella.
What did Michael say?

09:21.527 --> 09:22.762
He's trying it right now.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.530
We're gonna find out.
Okay, fine.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.900
What do
you have to say?

09:27.967 --> 09:29.135
I thought
it was  good.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.000
I'll tell him that.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.202
I'll tell him that.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.938
Have faith in me, baby.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.106
This ain't a normal guy.
It's a brit, huh?

09:34.173 --> 09:35.942
They're a pain in the neck.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.378
He thought
it was  good.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.214
Well...

09:42.281 --> 09:43.349
If he thought
that was  good,

09:43.416 --> 09:44.550
then I'm screwed.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.319
If you're screwed,
imagine how I am.

09:47.786 --> 09:48.821
And this is the...?

09:48.888 --> 09:50.356
Paella Marinara.

09:50.422 --> 09:51.524
The lobster
in this paella...

09:51.590 --> 09:52.691
Did it come from the tank?

09:54.727 --> 09:55.928
It comes from the tank.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.000
Oh,.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.100
Oh,.

10:01.132 --> 10:02.334
Okay.

10:04.736 --> 10:06.838
You don't like it?

10:06.839 --> 10:09.375
Well, would you be so kind
to taste it for me?

10:09.475 --> 10:11.110
Yeah.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.512
Badly, badly seasoned.

10:13.579 --> 10:16.081
Yeah.

10:16.148 --> 10:17.450
That's overcooked.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.819
This is ridiculous
that this pan even came out.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.821
Out of respect for
your granddad,

10:21.887 --> 10:23.823
that is a joke.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.158
Give me five minutes and
we'll have a chat together.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.861
Can I take this?
Yeah, please.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.000
Thank you.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.030
Thank you.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.568
Very kind,
but I've lost my appetite.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.941
Are you doing stuff
purposely wrong

10:42.007 --> 10:45.244
or is this paella...
I mean is that--?

10:45.311 --> 10:46.579
It's overcooked.

10:46.645 --> 10:47.680
All right.
All right?

10:47.746 --> 10:49.014
You go sit
and listen to him.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.149
He's right about everything.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.017
Nothing I can do
about that right now.

10:52.084 --> 10:56.689
I feel utterly
embarrassed and humiliated.

10:56.755 --> 10:58.123
The way food went out
the way it did,

10:58.190 --> 10:59.825
- it killed me.
- Okay.

10:59.892 --> 11:00.000
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.393
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.063
bisque,
dead lobsters,

11:04.129 --> 11:05.197
And the paella...

11:05.264 --> 11:07.967
The burnt
at the bottom.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.603
This is your grandfather
that put this thing together.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.404
Was he sending food out
like that?

11:12.471 --> 11:13.672
No.
No.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.341
What was wrong with
the chicken and garlic?

11:15.407 --> 11:16.442
The chicken
was way overcooked.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.143
Maybe the piece you had,
it was dry,

11:18.210 --> 11:19.745
but I finished the plate.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.947
Did you cook that dish?

11:23.983 --> 11:26.018
No, I did not cook
any dishes here today.
No.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.188
What do you
actually do, Michael?

11:29.255 --> 11:30.000
I don't taste
everything,

11:30.000 --> 11:30.356
I don't taste
everything,

11:30.422 --> 11:31.824
but I try to taste
as much as I can.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.160
You're the last
line of defense.

11:36.795 --> 11:38.430
Out of every dish
that I had there today,

11:38.497 --> 11:39.999
what did you taste of mine?

11:40.065 --> 11:41.800
Every single one.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.902
At least,
when it came back.

11:43.936 --> 11:45.437
When it came back?

11:45.504 --> 11:47.306
If your grandfather
sat at my table today,

11:47.373 --> 11:49.775
he'd be beating the crap
out of you.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.577
I'm proud of
what went out today.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.779
This is the food I do,
this is how they cook it,

11:53.846 --> 11:56.081
and I know the food
over here is good.

11:56.181 --> 11:58.017
You're
dreaming, Michael.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.654
Coming up...

12:01.720 --> 12:03.889
Chef Ramsay is confronted
with the most overstocked

12:03.956 --> 12:05.391
food storage
he has ever seen.

12:05.457 --> 12:07.293
Ugh!

12:07.359 --> 12:09.995
A kitchen whose standards
are a complete disgrace.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.298
Rancid chicken.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.933
You can't serve
that  tonight!

12:13.999 --> 12:16.602
And a family that is
being ripped apart.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.270
Just put it on
the  plate right now.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.439
Shut up!

12:20.506 --> 12:21.774
What the  you doing?
Get outta here!

12:21.840 --> 12:23.008
Stop it.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.977
Then, just when you think

12:25.044 --> 12:26.078
it couldn't get any worse...

12:26.145 --> 12:27.646
Come here!
Give me!

12:27.713 --> 12:29.648
I want the  food out,
leave me the  alone!

12:29.715 --> 12:30.000
Get out!
Leave him alone!

12:30.000 --> 12:30.983
Get out!
Leave him alone!

12:31.050 --> 12:32.551
Michael, Michael.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:32.551 --> 12:34.786
Coming up on Kitchen Nightmares.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.696
Hi, how are you?

12:43.762 --> 12:44.997
Enjoy your meal tonight.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.365
Welcome to
Spanish Pavillion.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.200
After an afternoon that included

12:48.267 --> 12:49.735
a dead lobster in the tank,

12:49.802 --> 12:51.270
a miserable lunch,

12:51.337 --> 12:53.572
and a head chef
that doesn't cook,

12:53.639 --> 12:55.674
Chef Ramsay
is anxious to observe

12:55.741 --> 12:57.609
a dinner service
at Spanish Pavillion.

12:57.676 --> 12:58.610
Can I get
the chicken and rice?

12:58.677 --> 12:59.912
Chicken and rice?

12:59.978 --> 13:01.547
I'm gonna try
the pollo Quixote.

13:01.613 --> 13:02.915
I'll pick
my own lobster right

13:02.981 --> 13:04.016
from the lobster tank
for you.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.556
Table eight, coming up.

13:06.556 --> 13:07.019
Table eight, coming up.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.487
Where's...
Where's Michael?

13:08.554 --> 13:10.022
He's just sitting
at the bar.
At the bar?

13:10.089 --> 13:11.090
How you doing, bro?

13:11.156 --> 13:12.524
Good, how you doing?
Nice to see you.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.360
Michael...
Can we get ready?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.428
I'm ready, Jerry.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.130
Ready...I see how
ready you are.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.200
No one's really
in the back of the house,

13:21.266 --> 13:23.402
you know, observing and
making sure everything's 100%.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.170
I think my brother

13:25.237 --> 13:26.271
should be monitoring that,
watching it.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.773
Despite head chef Michael

13:27.840 --> 13:30.042
Being absent
from the kitchen,

13:30.109 --> 13:31.543
dishes are being sent out.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.746
There you go,
they're here already.

13:33.812 --> 13:34.813
Unfortunately...

13:34.880 --> 13:35.948
They're all undercooked?

13:36.014 --> 13:36.556
You want me to cook them
a little more?

13:36.556 --> 13:37.583
You want me to cook them
a little more?

13:38.917 --> 13:40.119
Not done enough?

13:40.185 --> 13:41.987
They're also coming back.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.555
Said these are undercooked,
and a little chewy.

13:43.622 --> 13:44.890
Undercooked?
Yeah.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.892
They're right.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.160
Look at that.
Oh, my God!

13:48.260 --> 13:49.261
That's completely raw.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.029
Raw.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.898
Yep.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.199
Is this normal?
Yes.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.439
There's no one person
in charge of the kitchen.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.143
With dishes coming back,

14:04.209 --> 14:05.811
Michael jumps
back into the kitchen.

14:05.878 --> 14:06.556
This came back?
Michael, what was this?

14:06.556 --> 14:07.446
This came back?
Michael, what was this?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.047
I don't
know what that is.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.984
But so does Jerry.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.519
And both brothers are trying
to take control of the kitchen.

14:13.585 --> 14:14.653
Michael.
Yeah?

14:14.720 --> 14:16.121
Take this off
the window right now.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.756
I don't know what
you're pointing at, Jerry.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.491
You're driving me nuts.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.760
I won't let my brother
dictate what I do

14:21.827 --> 14:22.961
or how I run my business.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.463
Give me those
crab legs right now.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.464
Those crab legs have
to be finished cooking--

14:25.531 --> 14:26.865
Michael,
do what you're doing!

14:26.932 --> 14:27.766
When they're done cooking,
they'll come out!

14:27.833 --> 14:28.901
Do what you're doing!

14:28.967 --> 14:30.102
I am doing what
I'm doing.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.171
I'm telling you
about them snow crabs.

14:32.237 --> 14:34.840
Michael, can anyone
work together here?

14:34.907 --> 14:36.556
I mean, this is absolutely
hideous.

14:36.556 --> 14:38.677
I mean, this is absolutely
hideous.

14:38.777 --> 14:39.778
King crab legs...

14:39.845 --> 14:41.980
Already out, no?
This is just snow.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.215
No, there's
no king crab legs out.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.184
My God.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.885
If I'd known it
was gonna take this long,

14:46.952 --> 14:48.954
I would've definitely
had something before we left.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.089
Hopefully,
it's worth the wait.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.991
You confuse me.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.326
See? Gimme.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.360
The only thing I take
is the yellow ticket.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.628
You cannot touch me.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.564
Listen to me--
Give me a pork chop!

14:58.630 --> 14:59.965
Medium!

15:00.032 --> 15:02.201
Mike was in the middle,
he tried to do everything.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.803
And you know,
he confuses a lot of people.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.556
I need an order of
Spanish potatoes and rice.

15:06.556 --> 15:07.172
I need an order of
Spanish potatoes and rice.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.141
And I want this--
Together or separate?

15:09.208 --> 15:10.476
It doesn't matter--
Tell me!

15:10.542 --> 15:12.244
Separate.
Stop yelling.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.246
I'll knock you out
right here, you hear me?

15:14.313 --> 15:15.948
We need to get organized,
big time.

15:16.014 --> 15:17.783
Everyone's arguing with
each other, and it's like--

15:17.850 --> 15:19.318
No teamwork anywhere.
No.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.453
I want the food out.
I'm gonna go home
in a minute!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.121
Okay, me too.
I gotta go home too.

15:24.623 --> 15:25.924
Okay, give me--
Listen to me.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.693
Give me those lobsters!
People are waiting!

15:27.759 --> 15:28.760
They're right here,
where do you want them?

15:28.827 --> 15:29.862
Up your  a minute?

15:29.928 --> 15:30.896
Give them to me,
I'll take them out.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.299
Michael...
Keep it together.

15:34.366 --> 15:35.300
Listen, give
me the  food,

15:35.367 --> 15:36.535
I want to send it out!

15:36.602 --> 15:37.970
I want to send
all the  food out!

15:38.136 --> 15:39.371
Let's--come here!
Give me!

15:39.438 --> 15:41.240
- I want the  food out!
- Leave me  alone!

15:41.306 --> 15:42.841
Leave him alone!
Out!

15:42.908 --> 15:44.676
Just leave him alone.
Give me the food
that I want.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.044
The customers are waiting
for the food.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.312
Nobody's waiting
for any food.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.647
We're okay, we're okay,
we're okay.

15:48.714 --> 15:49.715
You got four tickets.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.383
I understand you're excited
right now.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.584
Leave me alone.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.553
Talk to me later!
Then get outta here!

15:54.620 --> 15:55.687
Michael!
Get out!

15:55.787 --> 15:56.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:05.630 --> 16:07.399
It's two hours
into dinner service...

16:07.465 --> 16:08.733
That's completely raw.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.402
With dishes being returned,

16:10.468 --> 16:12.037
and very little
food leaving the kitchen.

16:12.103 --> 16:13.238
Give me the food
that I want!

16:13.305 --> 16:14.806
The customers
are waiting for the food!

16:14.873 --> 16:16.508
There's now chaos
at Spanish Pavillion.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.944
- I want the  food out!
- Leave me  alone!

16:19.010 --> 16:20.445
Leave him alone!
Out!

16:20.512 --> 16:21.580
And it's all too much
for Michael.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.882
Talk to me later!
Then get outta here!

16:23.949 --> 16:25.083
Michael!
Get out!

16:25.150 --> 16:26.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

16:26.651 --> 16:28.286
Get outta here!
Stop it.

16:28.353 --> 16:29.754
Get outta here!
Michael!

16:29.821 --> 16:31.523
What's the matter with you?
Stop yelling!

16:31.623 --> 16:32.991
Is what I'm saying!

16:33.058 --> 16:34.059
- Al, Al.
- Stop it, Al.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.327
Michael, stop it.

16:35.393 --> 16:37.529
Al, no way.
Stop it.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.663
Stop it.

16:38.730 --> 16:41.466
Michael, Michael!
Okay, okay, okay.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.634
Michael, come here.
You better listen to them.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.336
Relax, relax, relax, relax.

16:44.402 --> 16:45.804
Just stop.
Stop.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.373
Michael...

16:48.440 --> 16:50.008
You're a  owner.
Just boom.

16:50.108 --> 16:51.476
Big, deep breath.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.812
What are you doing?
What are you doing to that man?

16:53.878 --> 16:56.047
He's here to help you.
I know he is.

16:56.114 --> 16:58.049
Well, then what
the  you doing?

16:58.116 --> 17:00.118
Michael should
never touch somebody.

17:00.218 --> 17:01.353
Stop it.

17:01.419 --> 17:01.594
Michael had
no right to do that,

17:01.594 --> 17:02.554
Michael had
no right to do that,

17:02.621 --> 17:04.089
Michael should not do that.

17:04.155 --> 17:06.424
That's where my brother
sometimes doesn't get it.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.093
Let's get
back at normal here.

17:08.159 --> 17:10.262
Go take a breather.

17:13.131 --> 17:14.266
Is that normal?

17:14.332 --> 17:15.900
My brother's reaction?
Yeah? Yeah.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.903
Um, he can get--he can flip
like that sometimes, yeah.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.305
I can't work like that.

17:23.475 --> 17:25.143
Jumping around
like a maniac.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.313
I--calm down,
calm down, calm down.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.848
Michael...

17:29.914 --> 17:31.594
Calm down,
calm down, calm down.
Michael, Michael.

17:31.594 --> 17:31.683
Calm down,
calm down, calm down.
Michael, Michael.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.018
You calm down now.

17:33.084 --> 17:35.220
And stop making
a big show out of this.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.521
I'm not--mom!
Stop it.

17:36.588 --> 17:37.989
I was the one that
made the show out of this.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.357
Again, it's my fault.
Stop it, Michael.

17:39.457 --> 17:40.725
Again,
it's my fault, Mom.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.494
Michael, stop it.
Again, it's my fault.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.263
Yeah.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.766
I lost my temper.
In the heat of the moment...

17:47.832 --> 17:48.833
It happens, but...

17:48.900 --> 17:51.102
Gotta calm down, regroup.

17:51.202 --> 17:53.171
And just breathe.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.373
With Michael cooling off
outside...

17:55.440 --> 17:57.075
Hey!

17:57.142 --> 17:58.076
The kitchen manages
to pull it together...

17:58.143 --> 17:59.978
Five's ready.
Take it out.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.579
Sending out the last orders
of the night.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.281
Have a good night.
You too.

18:03.381 --> 18:04.582
Thank you.

18:07.185 --> 18:08.987
Okay.

18:09.054 --> 18:12.257
Uh...
What a day.

18:12.324 --> 18:15.026
I've never, ever seen
such a disorganized,

18:15.093 --> 18:18.029
fragmented service--
ever.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.799
Disaster!

18:20.865 --> 18:22.200
Confusion in the kitchen,

18:22.267 --> 18:23.368
chaos in the dining room.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.136
Lots of confusion.

18:25.203 --> 18:26.738
Michael...

18:26.805 --> 18:29.140
I thought you were supposed
to be running the kitchen.

18:31.009 --> 18:31.594
I don't think you realize
how bad tonight was.

18:31.594 --> 18:34.012
I don't think you realize
how bad tonight was.

18:34.079 --> 18:38.316
I'll see you in the morning.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.089
After a night in which 21 dishes

18:44.155 --> 18:45.824
came back
during dinner service...

18:45.890 --> 18:47.092
That's completely raw.

18:47.158 --> 18:48.526
Oh, my God!
This is raw.

18:48.593 --> 18:50.295
Chef Ramsay comes in early

18:50.362 --> 18:52.197
to do
a little investigating.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.933
What is in there?

18:54.999 --> 18:57.736
They're not drumsticks,
they're crab sticks.

18:57.802 --> 19:00.505
Just dumped in here,
on top of another bag...

19:00.572 --> 19:01.594
of Alaskan crab.

19:01.594 --> 19:02.674
of Alaskan crab.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.543
No dates, no labels.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.412
How on Earth are you
supposed to run a business

19:07.479 --> 19:09.214
when you've got no idea
what's in the freezers?

19:11.716 --> 19:14.552
What is down in here?

19:14.652 --> 19:16.354
My God, it gets worse.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.190
Look at it.
It's absolutely jam-packed.

19:19.257 --> 19:23.428
Chicken after chicken
after chicken.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.363
My big worry
is how much chicken

19:25.430 --> 19:26.798
does this restaurant
really need?

19:26.865 --> 19:28.099
I mean, there
are just bags of it.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.402
And not only that,

19:30.468 --> 19:31.594
the smell is horrific.

19:31.594 --> 19:32.203
the smell is horrific.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.774
Ugh!
My God.

19:37.542 --> 19:38.810
Look at these fillets.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.613
I've seen less packs
at an army base.

19:41.679 --> 19:45.550
There's over
50 packs of meat.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.252
And whoever's buying this...

19:47.318 --> 19:48.520
Needs to be fired.

19:48.586 --> 19:49.754
Now what worries me
about this

19:49.821 --> 19:52.090
is there's
one more fridge upstairs.

19:55.026 --> 19:56.861
What is that?

19:56.928 --> 19:58.930
Pigeon.

19:58.997 --> 20:01.566
Oh, my God.
It's never-ending.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.734
Just when I think
I've seen enough,

20:02.801 --> 20:03.768
there's more.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.939
They're dead!

20:08.006 --> 20:10.575
Decomposed,
drop dead!

20:13.044 --> 20:15.613
Oh, that's the snails.
Ugh, hell.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.049
What is that in there?

20:18.116 --> 20:19.584
That is a raw, dead lobster.

20:19.684 --> 20:21.352
That is disgusting.

20:21.419 --> 20:22.554
It's two hours

20:22.620 --> 20:24.456
into Chef Ramsay's inspection.

20:24.522 --> 20:26.991
Michael, Balbina,
and Jerry arrive,

20:27.058 --> 20:28.259
unaware of what
Chef Ramsay is doing

20:28.326 --> 20:30.862
and what he has uncovered.

20:30.929 --> 20:31.594
Morning.

20:31.594 --> 20:31.996
Morning.

20:32.063 --> 20:33.431
Morning, Chef.
Good morning, Chef.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.801
I just need you
for two minutes.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.536
Who in the hell
buys the produce here?

20:38.603 --> 20:39.771
Who--who's responsible
for that?

20:39.838 --> 20:40.972
I am.
You are?

20:44.542 --> 20:48.046
Ing pigeon.

20:48.112 --> 20:49.247
What I'm trying to look at
are the proper--

20:49.347 --> 20:50.582
it's the purchasing,

20:50.648 --> 20:53.117
the thousands of dollars
of waste.

20:53.184 --> 20:56.421
These here--

20:56.521 --> 20:57.889
They came in yesterday.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.624
That's dead.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.594
Let's have a little look
around here.

21:01.594 --> 21:01.693
Let's have a little look
around here.

21:01.759 --> 21:03.828
Jerry, please.

21:03.895 --> 21:08.666
And you wonder why
I don't like your sauce.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.897
That is a dead lobster.

21:15.306 --> 21:17.008
And the freshest thing
in this kitchen

21:17.075 --> 21:18.543
is that pigeon,
flying around.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.813
And he's lucky
he's still alive.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.083
I thought that the kitchen
was in somewhat of a disarray.

21:25.149 --> 21:26.584
Did I think it was that bad?
No.

21:26.651 --> 21:30.121
I'd love to turn around
and say, "That's it."

21:30.188 --> 21:31.594
Have you seen what's
downstairs in the fridge?

21:31.594 --> 21:34.959
Have you seen what's
downstairs in the fridge?

21:35.026 --> 21:37.929
Where do I start with this?

21:37.996 --> 21:41.933
Look at all this
ing meat here.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.301
I wanted to make sure
I was ready.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.236
Ready for what?
For whatever came my way.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.471
Help me, Michael.
Ready for what?

21:46.538 --> 21:47.772
Whatever came my way.
Whatever came your way?

21:47.839 --> 21:49.173
I don't know what to expect.

21:49.240 --> 21:54.746
You're burning money
you haven't got.

21:54.812 --> 21:56.047
Why is this like this?

21:56.114 --> 21:58.249
What happened, Michael?

21:58.316 --> 22:01.252
Somebody's not doing
their job in the kitchen.

22:01.319 --> 22:01.594
There's
expensive produce here.

22:01.594 --> 22:02.987
There's
expensive produce here.

22:03.054 --> 22:05.356
This is ridiculous.

22:05.423 --> 22:07.825
Yeah, my fault.

22:07.892 --> 22:10.094
My fault I never
refrigerated it.

22:10.161 --> 22:14.198
I'm disappointed that so much
was ordered in advance.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.634
There's no excuse for that.

22:16.701 --> 22:17.969
Spend some time together.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.237
I've got to wash
my ing hands

22:19.304 --> 22:23.007
Before I get diagnosed
with ing staphlococci.

22:23.074 --> 22:24.909
You need to concentrate.
You know what?

22:24.976 --> 22:26.177
Maybe I'm overwhelmed, mom.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.946
Maybe I'm trying to do
everything and I can't.

22:28.012 --> 22:30.515
Maybe the office,
the ordering--

22:30.582 --> 22:31.594
What's the most important?

22:31.594 --> 22:31.983
What's the most important?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.151
I gotta iron that out,
Ma, no?

22:33.217 --> 22:34.786
This is the most important.

22:34.852 --> 22:36.988
And I...
try my hardest.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.057
I don't know what
to tell you about--

22:39.123 --> 22:41.559
about all this meat
and everything here.

22:41.626 --> 22:42.727
I'm out of here right now.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.963
It's overwhelming.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.698
I just don't have the answers.

22:51.669 --> 22:56.541
Balbina, this is so sad.
You know that.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.376
What would your father say if
he walked in here and saw that?

22:58.443 --> 23:01.594
Ah, my father, of course
would be upset.

23:01.594 --> 23:02.347
Ah, my father, of course
would be upset.

23:02.413 --> 23:04.515
What I saw
down there today,

23:04.582 --> 23:07.952
it's not
the Spanish Pavillion.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.221
It's not what
I was brought into.

23:10.288 --> 23:13.358
The quality of the food
meant a lot to my father.

23:13.424 --> 23:15.360
It's upsetting,
and I would hope things

23:15.426 --> 23:18.863
wouldn't get to the extreme
that I have to close the doors.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.300
I don't know right now
what's going through his mind,

23:22.367 --> 23:24.602
but his concentration
right now is totally off.

23:24.669 --> 23:25.937
He's all over the place.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.238
It shows.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.974
I think Jerry has to put in
a little more too.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.594
When he's here, he should
concentrate on the restaurant,

23:31.594 --> 23:34.379
When he's here, he should
concentrate on the restaurant,

23:34.479 --> 23:35.947
forget all your politics.

23:36.014 --> 23:38.416
Jerry needs Michael,
Michael needs Jerry.

23:38.483 --> 23:41.119
They now have to
roll up their sleeves,

23:41.185 --> 23:43.621
work together,
but more importantly,

23:43.688 --> 23:46.457
they've got to set their
differences aside as brothers

23:46.524 --> 23:48.793
and stop being so stubborn,
'cause that's what they are.

23:48.860 --> 23:52.296
And the business
is fragmented.

23:52.363 --> 23:53.364
Coming up...

23:53.431 --> 23:55.933
I want you to listen to me.
Shut up!

23:56.000 --> 23:57.235
Michael and Jerry are
at it again.

23:57.301 --> 23:58.670
Just put it on the ing
plate right now.

24:01.072 --> 24:01.594
And Chef Ramsay is fed up
with the brothers...

24:01.594 --> 24:02.373
And Chef Ramsay is fed up
with the brothers...

24:02.473 --> 24:04.108
Michael, support!

24:04.175 --> 24:06.544
And the food that is
leaving the kitchen.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.113
You can't serve
that  tonight.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.581
At this point, we're just
gonna shut it down.

24:10.648 --> 24:12.283
Oh, stop! Stop!

24:12.283 --> 24:13.985
You don't want to miss

24:14.051 --> 24:16.287
what's coming up next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

24:22.993 --> 24:24.461
Today, Chef Ramsay is determined

24:24.528 --> 24:27.064
to move the Spanish Pavillion
in the right direction,

24:27.130 --> 24:28.899
and he knows one step
is getting Michael back

24:28.965 --> 24:30.267
to where he belongs.

24:30.334 --> 24:31.935
I want you to think of
something that you want to cook.

24:32.002 --> 24:33.904
In the kitchen, cooking.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.539
Something that you'll want
tonight as the special.

24:35.639 --> 24:37.007
Yes, Chef.

24:37.074 --> 24:38.542
Right out of college,
I had a lot of passion,

24:38.608 --> 24:39.910
I had a lot of creativity.

24:39.976 --> 24:41.611
I would come up with dishes
a little easier.

24:41.678 --> 24:43.146
But I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

24:43.213 --> 24:45.716
to come up with something
that's gonna impress the chef.

24:45.782 --> 24:48.151
First of all, I want to do
a chicken and garlic.

24:48.251 --> 24:48.657
Yeah? A modern version.

24:48.657 --> 24:49.519
Yeah? A modern version.

24:49.586 --> 24:51.955
I want you to work with me
at the same time, yeah?

24:52.022 --> 24:54.024
I start it off
with olive oil.

24:54.091 --> 24:56.793
If you start off with butter,
it's going to burn.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.796
I'm excited about having
the opportunity to learn

24:59.863 --> 25:02.232
from one of the top five most
famous chefs in the world.

25:02.299 --> 25:05.836
You've got that nice sauteed
sear on the chicken.

25:05.902 --> 25:08.205
From there, you put it
over the top.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.774
And then just scoop up
a touch of that sauce.

25:10.874 --> 25:13.643
Modern Spanish cuisine.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.245
What do you think
that you want to cook?

25:15.312 --> 25:16.913
My grandfather
is really well known

25:17.013 --> 25:17.981
for some octopus.

25:18.048 --> 25:18.657
Okay.

25:18.657 --> 25:19.182
Okay.

25:19.249 --> 25:20.951
And I want to make
some octopus with you.

25:21.051 --> 25:23.420
Nice. Go for it.

25:23.487 --> 25:24.821
I'm nervous right now.

25:24.888 --> 25:25.856
I hope this dish
comes out right.

25:25.922 --> 25:27.190
Through the years,

25:27.257 --> 25:30.627
I've lost some of my passion
for this kitchen.

25:30.694 --> 25:31.795
So far, it looks good.

25:31.862 --> 25:33.864
I know that Chef Ramsay
can help me

25:33.930 --> 25:35.332
by bringing my passion back,

25:35.399 --> 25:36.967
and I'm looking forward
to it.

25:37.033 --> 25:39.636
This is the octopus.

25:39.703 --> 25:40.670
Okay.

25:40.771 --> 25:41.938
And, uh, roasted potatoes.

25:42.005 --> 25:46.476
Yes.

25:46.543 --> 25:48.412
Yeah.
Good. That's nice.

25:48.478 --> 25:48.657
Yeah, I like it.
The presentation as well.

25:48.657 --> 25:50.113
Yeah, I like it.
The presentation as well.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.882
I like it.

25:51.948 --> 25:55.352
And tonight, I want you
this side of the line, right?

25:55.419 --> 25:56.353
Yeah?

25:56.420 --> 25:57.454
Yes, Chef.

26:00.457 --> 26:03.126
Chef Ramsay's
chicken and garlic special

26:03.193 --> 26:05.796
and Michael's octopus special
are going on tonight's menu.

26:05.862 --> 26:08.031
The chicken dish
is a modern version

26:08.098 --> 26:09.366
of a garlic chicken.

26:09.433 --> 26:10.767
But after serving

26:10.867 --> 26:11.902
the same old menu...

26:11.968 --> 26:13.103
Read the special
back to me.

26:13.170 --> 26:15.005
I'm sorry, I--

26:15.071 --> 26:16.573
20-year veteran Joe

26:16.640 --> 26:18.657
is having a hard time
with the change.

26:18.657 --> 26:18.809
is having a hard time
with the change.

26:18.875 --> 26:21.077
Chicken, Chef, on the bone,
with garlic.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.112
"Chicken, Chef,
on the bone"?

26:22.179 --> 26:23.647
Come on.
You can do it, Joe.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.649
You are making me
nervous now.

26:25.749 --> 26:27.117
I'm making you nervous?

26:27.184 --> 26:28.218
Yes.

26:28.285 --> 26:29.719
Just put your head in there
for two minutes.

26:29.786 --> 26:31.021
Cool it down.

26:31.087 --> 26:32.589
Put it in there.
That's it.

26:32.656 --> 26:34.424
Stay in two minutes.
it feels so nice, cold.

26:38.395 --> 26:39.262
Hi, how are you?

26:39.429 --> 26:40.530
So follow me, please.

26:40.597 --> 26:41.998
Thank you.
Enjoy.

26:42.065 --> 26:44.267
Okay, guys, let's go, yeah?

26:44.334 --> 26:45.235
Chef Ramsay knows

26:45.302 --> 26:47.404
the success of this restaurant

26:47.471 --> 26:48.657
depends on Jerry and Michael
working together.

26:48.657 --> 26:49.139
depends on Jerry and Michael
working together.

26:49.206 --> 26:50.774
Michael.
Yes, Chef.

26:50.841 --> 26:51.975
I want to look at you,
yeah?

26:52.042 --> 26:53.710
And I want this level
of communication.

26:53.777 --> 26:55.145
Much better than we had
last night.

26:55.212 --> 26:57.080
So tonight, both brothers are
assigned

26:57.147 --> 26:58.515
to doing what they do best--

26:58.582 --> 27:00.250
Michael cooking
behind the line...

27:00.317 --> 27:02.185
All right, listen.
Try to take care of this area.

27:02.252 --> 27:03.987
And Jerry running the pass.

27:04.054 --> 27:05.489
Michael, listen to me.
I'm listening.

27:05.555 --> 27:06.890
No, look at me one minute.

27:06.957 --> 27:10.060
If the  hits the fan,
I want you to listen to me.

27:10.126 --> 27:11.528
Yes, Chef.
No, I mean it.

27:11.595 --> 27:13.163
Yes, Chef.
Okay.

27:13.230 --> 27:14.731
I got to admit,
I'm a little nervous right now.

27:14.798 --> 27:15.732
I don't know what to expect.

27:15.799 --> 27:17.234
I'm afraid of failure.

27:17.300 --> 27:18.657
I might  it up,
but just remind me.

27:18.657 --> 27:19.636
I might  it up,
but just remind me.

27:19.703 --> 27:20.904
We can handle this,
all right?

27:20.971 --> 27:22.839
We're gonna see.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.442
The chicken today, uh,
the chicken, uh, our chef,

27:25.509 --> 27:29.012
a little wine for a dress.

27:29.079 --> 27:32.682
Sherry. Sherry wine.
Okay?

27:32.749 --> 27:33.750
A little lemon juice

27:33.817 --> 27:36.286
and a little touch of butter.

27:36.353 --> 27:39.055
There goes the first ticket,
right?

27:39.122 --> 27:40.490
Let me have
a chicken special, all right?

27:40.557 --> 27:42.692
First order comes in,
it's a special.

27:42.759 --> 27:43.960
It's good, it's good.

27:44.027 --> 27:46.563
It's, like, perfect, bro,
but it scares me.

27:46.630 --> 27:48.657
I just don't trust it.

27:48.657 --> 27:49.065
I just don't trust it.

27:49.132 --> 27:50.667
You can see it in his eyes,
he's a little nervous.

27:50.734 --> 27:53.336
So hopefully we'll get
through the night.

27:53.403 --> 27:55.272
Okay, I'll take that chicken
and garlic out.

27:55.338 --> 27:58.108
First one of the night.
Go. Table six.

27:58.174 --> 28:00.410
Despite Michael's lack
of confidence...

28:00.477 --> 28:02.646
I'm not gonna be able
to do it.

28:02.712 --> 28:04.114
The specials are not only
leaving the kitchen...

28:04.180 --> 28:05.715
Oh, wow.

28:05.782 --> 28:07.484
Ooh.

28:07.551 --> 28:08.752
The customers...

28:08.852 --> 28:10.120
This is really good.

28:10.186 --> 28:11.321
Are thrilled with the food.

28:11.388 --> 28:12.722
Delicious!
I like it.

28:12.789 --> 28:13.924
Wow.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.892
With the dining room now full

28:15.959 --> 28:17.494
And orders pouring
into the kitchen...

28:17.561 --> 28:18.657
I don't know
what's going on.

28:18.657 --> 28:19.663
I don't know
what's going on.

28:19.729 --> 28:21.131
Michael, not used to being
on the line,

28:21.197 --> 28:23.633
is starting to buckle
under the pressure.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.368
All right, give me
table three or six.

28:25.435 --> 28:26.670
We gotta get this food out.

28:26.736 --> 28:28.104
There's no rush.

28:28.171 --> 28:29.973
Well, there's a little bit
of a pressing now.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.275
Well, let 'em wait.

28:32.342 --> 28:35.946
Well, it's been taking
an awful long time.

28:36.012 --> 28:38.481
Uh, Joe, Joe,
is it me

28:38.548 --> 28:39.549
or are things taking
a long time to come out?

28:39.616 --> 28:40.684
Yeah. Yes.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.986
Too slow.
Way too slow.

28:43.053 --> 28:44.521
Oh!

28:44.588 --> 28:47.190
Tables are gonna
get up and leave in ten seconds.

28:47.257 --> 28:48.657
I need table 13.

28:48.657 --> 28:48.725
I need table 13.

28:48.792 --> 28:51.127
It's about four--three minutes
away. Don't keep asking.

28:51.194 --> 28:54.064
We have all these tables
waiting for food,

28:54.130 --> 28:57.734
and Michael is overwhelmed
with his kitchen duties,

28:57.834 --> 28:59.002
and I need him to focus.

29:00.403 --> 29:02.205
Just put it on the ing
plate right now.

29:02.272 --> 29:03.673
Shut up!

29:03.773 --> 29:05.208
Come on, guys.

29:05.275 --> 29:07.177
As tensions escalate
in the kitchen,

29:07.243 --> 29:10.847
very little food is making
its way out to the dining room.

29:10.914 --> 29:12.248
And one customer

29:12.315 --> 29:13.984
who was lucky enough
to receive food...

29:14.050 --> 29:16.219
The chicken is dry
and mushy.

29:16.286 --> 29:17.253
Isn't exactly happy.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.657
They didn't like it?

29:18.657 --> 29:20.523
They didn't like it?

29:20.590 --> 29:25.795
- Jerry, it's not normal.
- It's not ing normal.

29:25.862 --> 29:29.699
That one chicken,
it just didn't smell right.

29:29.766 --> 29:30.567
Oh, come on.

29:31.701 --> 29:33.136
Oh, no.

29:33.203 --> 29:34.638
Jerry.
Yeah?

29:34.704 --> 29:36.206
Two seconds. Michael.
Yes, Chef.

29:36.272 --> 29:37.540
Urgently, quickly.

29:37.607 --> 29:40.610
Smell. That's gone.
No, but smell it.

29:40.710 --> 29:41.978
Don't just say.

29:42.045 --> 29:43.279
Give me the sauce for this.
It's gone.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.916
You can't serve
that  tonight.

29:46.983 --> 29:48.657
I felt utterly embarrassed
and humiliated.

29:48.657 --> 29:50.253
I felt utterly embarrassed
and humiliated.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.755
At this point, we're just gonna
shut it down.

29:51.821 --> 29:53.423
Oh, stop! Stop!

30:02.666 --> 30:04.634
It's an hour and a half
into dinner service.

30:06.336 --> 30:07.471
And while Jerry and Michael

30:07.537 --> 30:08.805
continue to clash
in the kitchen...

30:08.872 --> 30:10.140
Just put it on the ing
plate right now.

30:10.207 --> 30:11.274
Shut up!

30:11.341 --> 30:12.476
Chef Ramsay discovers

30:12.542 --> 30:13.543
Something disturbing.

30:13.610 --> 30:14.611
Oh, no.

30:14.678 --> 30:15.579
Spoiled chicken

30:15.645 --> 30:16.847
in the Spanish Pavillion.

30:16.913 --> 30:20.283
You can't serve
that  tonight!

30:20.350 --> 30:22.152
Oh, no!

30:22.219 --> 30:24.654
Al, have you got chicken
in the fryer?

30:24.721 --> 30:26.356
Yes.
Just toss that chicken, eh?

30:26.423 --> 30:27.424
I got one here.
No, don't serve it!

30:27.491 --> 30:28.992
Don't ing dare!

30:29.059 --> 30:29.798
Sal, go get me a chicken.

30:29.798 --> 30:30.427
Sal, go get me a chicken.

30:30.494 --> 30:32.095
Let's cut an order
real quick, fresh, right now.

30:32.162 --> 30:34.598
Michael, how many fresh
chickens are downstairs?

30:34.664 --> 30:37.234
A case and a half.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.404
A case and a half downstairs
in the ing fridge?

30:40.470 --> 30:42.906
And he's serving you
that stinky?

30:42.973 --> 30:46.676
You're cooking it,
and it's off!

30:46.743 --> 30:48.879
You know, I don't know
why that chicken got there.

30:48.945 --> 30:50.714
We've got fresh chickens
downstairs.

30:50.781 --> 30:51.815
You know what?

30:51.882 --> 30:53.984
We gotta use
that fresh chicken there.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.185
But when you're
in the weeds,

30:55.252 --> 30:57.254
you have to focus.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.789
All right, we have
the chicken and garlic.

30:58.855 --> 30:59.623
They're using the ones
that are downstairs.

30:59.689 --> 30:59.798
Thank you, thank you.

30:59.798 --> 31:00.891
Thank you, thank you.

31:00.957 --> 31:02.759
If you're gonna keep
the customers waiting,

31:02.826 --> 31:04.027
you've got to make sure
it's right.

31:04.094 --> 31:05.395
I'm not gonna
let it crumble.

31:05.462 --> 31:06.530
He'll get it.

31:06.596 --> 31:08.031
We gotta get this food out.

31:08.098 --> 31:09.533
Give me that chicken
and garlic. Let's go.

31:09.599 --> 31:11.735
Jerry, you'll get
the chicken and garlic

31:11.835 --> 31:12.969
when it's done, please.

31:13.036 --> 31:14.905
Al! Al, give me table two.

31:14.971 --> 31:17.307
this. Give me
table two.
That's it.

31:17.374 --> 31:19.276
With Jerry clearly stepping up
as the leader...

31:19.376 --> 31:20.610
Take this to table two.

31:20.677 --> 31:23.013
The evening is salvaged,

31:23.079 --> 31:26.249
And food is leaving
the kitchen once again.

31:26.316 --> 31:27.818
Everything's coming out
right now.

31:27.884 --> 31:29.553
At the end of the day,
getting that food out

31:29.653 --> 31:29.798
Is, like, a relief.

31:29.798 --> 31:30.587
Is, like, a relief.

31:30.654 --> 31:31.822
Thank you.

31:31.888 --> 31:33.156
They might have had to wait,
like, an hour,

31:33.223 --> 31:37.127
but we'll get it down
eventually.

31:37.194 --> 31:39.629
Honestly,
tonight was better.

31:39.696 --> 31:41.865
Everybody
liked the specials,

31:41.932 --> 31:43.400
but let's not get too excited
about tonight,

31:43.467 --> 31:46.937
because the quality control
has to be much better.

31:47.037 --> 31:48.705
You're absolutely right.

31:48.772 --> 31:51.908
Michael, your cooks
are passing you

31:51.975 --> 31:54.578
stinking, rancid chicken,

31:54.644 --> 31:57.681
but you didn't spot it.

31:57.747 --> 31:59.798
Jerry, I thought
your performance tonight

31:59.798 --> 32:01.084
Jerry, I thought
your performance tonight

32:01.151 --> 32:02.986
was bloody good.

32:03.053 --> 32:04.421
Thank you, Chef.

32:04.488 --> 32:07.757
Tonight was better.

32:07.824 --> 32:10.460
Hopefully we're headed
in the right direction.

32:10.527 --> 32:13.296
Good night.

32:13.363 --> 32:15.398
With the Spanish Pavillion

32:15.465 --> 32:17.901
at least headed
in the right direction,

32:17.968 --> 32:19.536
Chef Ramsay and his team
work overnight

32:19.603 --> 32:24.174
to give the Spanish Pavillion
a modern makeover.

32:24.241 --> 32:25.175
Good morning.

32:25.242 --> 32:26.810
Good morning, Chef.

32:26.910 --> 32:29.212
Good to see you all.

32:29.279 --> 32:29.798
Let's be honest,
not much has changed

32:29.798 --> 32:30.647
Let's be honest,
not much has changed

32:30.714 --> 32:32.148
over the last 30 years,
right?
correct.

32:32.215 --> 32:34.184
Today is the beginning
of a new era,

32:34.251 --> 32:37.120
and through that door
is your future.

32:37.187 --> 32:38.855
Are you ready to see it?
Yes!

32:38.922 --> 32:39.789
Michael, are you ready?

32:39.890 --> 32:41.224
Yeah.

32:41.291 --> 32:44.394
One, two, three. Come on in.

32:44.461 --> 32:45.929
Look at this.

32:45.996 --> 32:46.830
Beautiful.

32:46.897 --> 32:48.565
Nice.

32:48.632 --> 32:50.634
That's what
I'm talking about.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.602
Great.

32:52.669 --> 32:54.070
A warm, inviting atmosphere.

32:54.137 --> 32:55.539
We removed
the stained glass

32:55.605 --> 32:56.606
to give it a modern feel.

32:56.673 --> 32:57.974
Really unreal.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.798
And then down here,
we've increased the seating

32:59.798 --> 33:00.544
And then down here,
we've increased the seating

33:00.610 --> 33:03.613
so we have a lovely
banquette.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.482
Tablecloths have gone.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.117
Gone!

33:07.183 --> 33:09.519
All the tables
have been replaced.

33:09.586 --> 33:11.288
Oh!
Yes!

33:11.354 --> 33:13.189
This is walnut.

33:13.256 --> 33:15.191
It's modern and it's warm.

33:15.258 --> 33:17.928
On the tabletops, we have
the most amazing China.

33:18.028 --> 33:19.663
Oh, baby!

33:19.729 --> 33:20.797
Provided by
tabletops unlimited.

33:20.864 --> 33:21.765
Awesome.

33:21.831 --> 33:22.666
How exciting is that?

33:22.766 --> 33:23.967
I love it, baby.

33:24.034 --> 33:25.235
It's amazing.

33:25.302 --> 33:26.736
I feel like I'm in
another restaurant.

33:26.803 --> 33:29.339
I couldn't believe the openness
of the dining room.

33:29.406 --> 33:29.798
I'm glad to see
the tablecloths gone.

33:29.798 --> 33:31.041
I'm glad to see
the tablecloths gone.

33:31.107 --> 33:32.108
The new plates.

33:32.208 --> 33:33.276
The Spanish look.

33:33.343 --> 33:34.311
I felt like
I was in Spain.

33:34.377 --> 33:35.245
It is awesome.

33:35.345 --> 33:37.147
Nice!

33:39.015 --> 33:41.251
Following the much-needed
redesign,

33:41.318 --> 33:43.320
Chef Ramsay
now turns his attention

33:43.420 --> 33:46.389
to attracting new customers.

33:46.456 --> 33:49.960
When your grandfather
opened his restaurant there,

33:50.026 --> 33:52.028
he did not face
the competition

33:52.095 --> 33:54.064
that you now face.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.633
I really do mean
competition.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.568
Look...
Oh!

33:58.635 --> 33:59.669
At that.

33:59.736 --> 33:59.798
2010,
40 Spanish restaurants

33:59.798 --> 34:02.772
2010,
40 Spanish restaurants

34:02.839 --> 34:05.575
within a two-mile radius
of your front door.

34:05.642 --> 34:08.345
Having studied
the neighborhood,

34:08.411 --> 34:09.479
all these restaurants
are serving

34:09.546 --> 34:10.981
the same bloody food.

34:11.047 --> 34:13.516
You have an opportunity now
to stand out.

34:13.583 --> 34:14.584
Are you ready
to see your dishes?

34:14.651 --> 34:15.852
Oh, yes.

34:15.919 --> 34:18.221
Come with me.
Let's go.

34:18.288 --> 34:20.790
Please, come through.

34:20.857 --> 34:23.793
Small tapas
is the taste of Spain.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.796
Authentic, delicious,
and homemade.

34:26.863 --> 34:29.399
You have to push
thetapas.

34:29.466 --> 34:29.798
This is what turns
this restaurant around.

34:29.798 --> 34:31.134
This is what turns
this restaurant around.

34:31.201 --> 34:35.205
A roasted lamb Spanish meatball
in a fresh tomato sauce.

34:35.271 --> 34:37.607
Bacon-wrapped dates, yes?

34:37.674 --> 34:40.510
Sauteed prawns with garlic,
a little bit of shaved fennel.

34:40.577 --> 34:42.846
Olives with
manchego cheese, yeah?

34:42.912 --> 34:44.547
We're going for flavor,
simplicity,

34:44.614 --> 34:46.182
and we're going for Spain.

34:46.249 --> 34:48.084
I love the new menu.

34:48.151 --> 34:50.186
To be different
is incredible.

34:50.253 --> 34:53.556
That is the key to make
our restaurant stand out.

34:53.623 --> 34:56.593
But just as important,
here are your new waiters.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.228
Come in, come in,
come in, come in.

34:58.294 --> 34:59.729
Look at these guys.
Come in.

34:59.796 --> 34:59.798
Ah, look at you.
Amazing.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.966
Ah, look at you.
Amazing.

35:03.033 --> 35:05.635
They now no longer look
like undertakers.

35:05.702 --> 35:07.470
It makes you look thinner.

35:07.537 --> 35:08.538
Love it, love it.

35:08.605 --> 35:09.673
Ah, baby.

35:11.274 --> 35:13.977
Ah, look, baby.
Look at this. Look.

35:16.112 --> 35:18.281
I love this guy.

35:18.348 --> 35:19.749
Okay,
tonight is your night.

35:19.816 --> 35:21.217
There's nothing that you
cannot do here.

35:21.284 --> 35:22.952
Good luck.
Thank you.

35:25.422 --> 35:28.291
Chef, an order comes in,
who's touching that ticket?

35:28.358 --> 35:29.798
Who do you think?
Jerry?

35:29.798 --> 35:30.093
Who do you think?
Jerry?

35:30.193 --> 35:31.261
That's right.

35:31.327 --> 35:33.096
And I'm gonna
give it right there.

35:33.163 --> 35:34.864
Absolutely, over.
Okay.

35:34.931 --> 35:36.266
But Jerry,
he's gonna lose the ticket.

35:36.332 --> 35:37.567
He will not lose it.

35:37.634 --> 35:38.835
Why are you talking
so negatively?

35:38.902 --> 35:40.670
Oh, no.

35:40.737 --> 35:42.338
I'm trying to foresee
a possible problem.

35:42.405 --> 35:43.573
Well, don't foresee.
Just focus.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.574
You're right.
Yeah?

35:44.641 --> 35:46.476
Yes.
You're thinking too hard.

35:46.543 --> 35:48.011
It must hurt.

35:48.078 --> 35:50.113
Right now, I have to
trust my brother,

35:50.180 --> 35:52.115
and I don't know
if I could do that.

35:52.215 --> 35:53.817
I'm worried that the whole thing
could fall apart.

35:53.883 --> 35:56.720
With over 40 Spanish restaurants

35:56.786 --> 35:58.188
in two square miles...

35:58.254 --> 35:59.622
This is our new menu.

35:59.689 --> 35:59.798
Chef Ramsay's menu overhaul

35:59.798 --> 36:01.558
Chef Ramsay's menu overhaul

36:01.624 --> 36:03.593
will now have the Spanish
Pavillion standing out.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.729
The croquetas is great.

36:05.795 --> 36:08.064
And I will do, um,
paella.

36:08.131 --> 36:09.299
But will the brothers

36:09.365 --> 36:10.433
Be able to pull it off?

36:10.500 --> 36:12.435
Here we go.
First order coming in.

36:12.502 --> 36:15.238
One meatball,
one manchego croquettes,

36:15.305 --> 36:16.740
and the clams with chorizo.

36:16.806 --> 36:17.807
Come on, guys.
This is the first order.

36:17.874 --> 36:18.942
We gotta do it right.

36:19.008 --> 36:21.010
Let's go.

36:21.077 --> 36:23.246
Table two appetizers,
go.

36:23.313 --> 36:25.582
I'm sending youpatatas bravas,
one dates, table 11.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.350
Okay.
It looks wonderful, brother.

36:27.417 --> 36:28.418
Let's go.
This is gone.

36:28.485 --> 36:29.798
Let's go.

36:29.798 --> 36:30.186
Let's go.

36:30.253 --> 36:32.555
After that,
it's a rack of lamb, medium.

36:32.622 --> 36:33.656
How is it?

36:33.723 --> 36:34.791
Yummy.

36:34.858 --> 36:35.892
How is it?
It's good.

36:35.959 --> 36:38.128
Yeah?
Yeah. I like it.

36:38.194 --> 36:40.997
The sauce is so spicy,
it tastes...Love it.

36:41.064 --> 36:42.832
I think they love
thosetapasplates.

36:42.899 --> 36:44.100
Sure, and it's
a great way of--

36:44.167 --> 36:45.301
I think that was a great idea
that you came up with.

36:45.368 --> 36:46.669
A great way of pulling in
extra revenue.

36:46.736 --> 36:49.205
I've had them in Spain,
but these are much better.

36:49.272 --> 36:51.674
We are Tobin,
party of 12.

36:51.741 --> 36:52.809
As the dining room fills up...

36:52.876 --> 36:53.977
Another order coming in.

36:54.043 --> 36:55.712
Orders continue to pour in,

36:55.779 --> 36:56.946
And it's time
for the kitchen

36:57.013 --> 36:58.882
to face its first big test.

36:58.948 --> 36:59.798
Send me that table six.

36:59.798 --> 37:00.016
Send me that table six.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.918
Table six,
didn't we send it out?

37:01.985 --> 37:03.353
That went out.
Six went out, Jerry.

37:03.419 --> 37:04.621
No. No, it didn't.

37:04.687 --> 37:06.289
Six went out, Jerry.
Or maybe not.

37:06.356 --> 37:08.124
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
Okay, here it is.

37:08.191 --> 37:10.126
Here it is. All right,
it's two meatballs.

37:10.193 --> 37:12.228
No, Michael, table six
doesn't have any meatballs.

37:12.295 --> 37:14.464
Michael, let Jerry
do his job.

37:14.531 --> 37:17.600
I think Michael is overwhelmed
and he doesn't focus,

37:17.667 --> 37:19.035
And that's what
we have to deal with

37:19.102 --> 37:20.069
almost every day
with Michael.

37:20.136 --> 37:21.771
That's it. Go. 17.

37:21.871 --> 37:23.439
Jerry, whoa, whoa!

37:23.506 --> 37:24.707
You got thecroquetas,
Jerry?

37:24.808 --> 37:25.708
'Cause he left without them.

37:25.809 --> 37:26.876
For who, Michael?
That's--

37:26.943 --> 37:29.345
The order is one mussels--
No.

37:29.412 --> 37:29.798
No, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

37:29.798 --> 37:31.714
No, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

37:31.781 --> 37:33.850
Get organized, buddy.
Yeah?

37:33.917 --> 37:35.485
He's like a ing rabbit
in a headlight.

37:35.552 --> 37:36.986
Look at him.
Let's go.

37:37.053 --> 37:38.488
Michael's confusion
in the kitchen

37:38.555 --> 37:40.256
Turns the dining room...

37:40.323 --> 37:43.793
I wonder what's taking them
so long?

37:43.860 --> 37:45.695
Into a waiting room.

37:45.762 --> 37:47.263
Michael, listen to me.

37:47.330 --> 37:50.967
Michael.
You're not listening.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.969
And Jerry's attempt to restore
the communication...

37:53.036 --> 37:54.537
I need--listen to me.
Listen to me.

37:54.604 --> 37:56.940
Falls on deaf ears.

37:57.006 --> 37:58.208
I need a shrimp
right now, Sal.

37:58.308 --> 37:59.375
Table five.

37:59.442 --> 37:59.798
Sir, did seven
get their appetizers?

37:59.798 --> 38:00.710
Sir, did seven
get their appetizers?

38:00.777 --> 38:01.578
Table five.

38:01.644 --> 38:03.112
No, table seven did not.

38:03.179 --> 38:05.782
But before table seven,
I need table five.

38:05.849 --> 38:07.083
It's not gonna cook
any quicker

38:07.150 --> 38:10.053
the more you ask for it,
brother.

38:10.119 --> 38:11.588
Right. Now you, you--

38:11.654 --> 38:13.189
Hey, step up to the mark
a little bit, okay?

38:13.256 --> 38:14.490
Work with your team.

38:14.557 --> 38:15.959
We all know Michael

38:16.025 --> 38:17.794
Feels that he has to be
in control at all times.

38:17.861 --> 38:21.030
Jerry, it's my line.

38:21.097 --> 38:22.665
So the reality of it is,

38:22.732 --> 38:24.534
The person on the other
side of the line

38:24.601 --> 38:26.102
is expediting the food,

38:26.169 --> 38:27.837
and that person
is the orchestra leader.

38:27.904 --> 38:29.798
He's got to listen to
that person no matter what.

38:29.798 --> 38:30.740
He's got to listen to
that person no matter what.

38:30.807 --> 38:33.443
And right now,
I'm that person.

38:33.509 --> 38:35.178
Michael, do you have table
seven over there, please?

38:35.245 --> 38:38.348
Didn't that go out?
No.

38:38.414 --> 38:39.682
Give me three skirt steaks
over there right away.

38:39.782 --> 38:43.519
Right here! Three!
One, two, three!

38:43.620 --> 38:45.688
Michael, support!

38:59.869 --> 39:01.971
It's re-launch night
at the Spanish Pavillion,

39:02.038 --> 39:03.339
and while the restaurant
feels new,

39:03.406 --> 39:05.642
the mounting pressure
has brought out the old Michael.

39:07.944 --> 39:10.213
And the restaurant is teetering
on disaster.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.481
I need table five.

39:11.548 --> 39:13.483
Didn't that go out?
No.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.218
Give me three skirt steaks
over there right away.

39:15.285 --> 39:17.821
Right here! Three!
One, two, three!

39:20.090 --> 39:22.725
Michael, come here.

39:22.792 --> 39:25.795
Two seconds.

39:25.862 --> 39:25.934
You have to
keep it together.

39:25.934 --> 39:27.897
You have to
keep it together.

39:27.964 --> 39:29.432
He's your brother.

39:29.499 --> 39:32.102
You can't do that in front
of the ing team.

39:32.168 --> 39:33.837
You've got to show him
some ing respect.

39:33.903 --> 39:35.772
Yes, it's hard,

39:35.839 --> 39:38.108
but you've got
to back off.

39:38.174 --> 39:39.576
He's up to his eyeballs
in the ing weeds,

39:39.642 --> 39:40.977
and you're laying into him.

39:41.044 --> 39:42.345
Ing slow down.

39:42.412 --> 39:43.713
He's your brother,

39:43.780 --> 39:45.915
and it's your business
and his business, got it?

39:45.982 --> 39:46.816
Yes, Chef.
Come on.

39:46.883 --> 39:48.651
Yes, Chef.

39:48.718 --> 39:50.487
Chef Ramsay's 100% right.

39:50.553 --> 39:53.590
I cannot argue
with my brother.

39:53.656 --> 39:55.158
I overdid it, man.

39:55.291 --> 39:55.934
I made a mistake,
and it won't happen again.

39:55.934 --> 39:58.261
I made a mistake,
and it won't happen again.

39:58.328 --> 39:59.395
I'm gonna learn, and it's
gonna be better.

39:59.462 --> 40:01.331
Right, regroup
and organize after that.

40:01.397 --> 40:02.899
Jerry,
what would you like?

40:02.966 --> 40:04.667
I need those clams

40:04.734 --> 40:06.769
and I need
the paella marinara for two,

40:06.836 --> 40:08.371
and then, after that,
it's a rack of lamb, medium.

40:08.438 --> 40:10.340
In my hand, sir.

40:10.406 --> 40:12.041
That's it right there,
right? Okay.

40:12.108 --> 40:13.476
Ooh, hot.
That's very hot.

40:13.543 --> 40:14.777
Okay. Gambas.

40:14.844 --> 40:15.879
Let's do the bar. I need
an order of gambas.

40:15.945 --> 40:18.248
Coming right now.
That's what I need.

40:18.314 --> 40:19.215
With Michael and Jerry

40:19.282 --> 40:20.683
Finally working together...

40:20.750 --> 40:21.618
I need patatas bravas.

40:21.684 --> 40:22.652
Gonna be right out.

40:22.719 --> 40:24.320
Patatas bravas
will be right out.

40:24.387 --> 40:25.788
The two brothers
complete dinner service...

40:25.855 --> 40:25.934
Yee-haw!

40:25.934 --> 40:27.624
Yee-haw!

40:27.690 --> 40:28.725
On a high.

40:28.791 --> 40:30.326
This is so good.

40:30.393 --> 40:31.461
Delicious.

40:31.528 --> 40:33.396
Oh!
That looks so good.

40:33.463 --> 40:34.731
How's your dessert?

40:34.797 --> 40:35.965
Very good.

40:36.032 --> 40:37.500
All right?
Okay.
Yeah.

40:37.567 --> 40:39.102
This is good.

40:39.169 --> 40:41.237
Best Spanish restaurant
in this area.

40:50.079 --> 40:52.281
Tonight confirmed that
the Spanish Pavillion

40:52.348 --> 40:55.551
is back on the map
and ready to compete.

40:55.618 --> 40:55.934
But tomorrow, it starts
all over again.

40:55.934 --> 40:57.754
But tomorrow, it starts
all over again.

40:57.854 --> 40:59.122
Tonight wasn't perfect,

40:59.188 --> 41:02.392
but we did make
an amazing transformation.

41:02.492 --> 41:03.726
Thank you, Chef.

41:03.793 --> 41:05.928
Fun to finally meet you.
Likewise.

41:05.995 --> 41:07.330
Likewise, likewise.
Thank you.

41:07.397 --> 41:10.767
Just to hear the chef say,
"You guys can do it,"

41:10.833 --> 41:13.669
it really got to my sons.

41:13.736 --> 41:16.339
You two, in 30 seconds,
in the bar, please, together.

41:16.506 --> 41:17.774
For them to realize

41:17.840 --> 41:20.109
if you work together

41:20.176 --> 41:22.111
and you concentrate,

41:22.178 --> 41:25.381
you've got
a good business here.

41:25.448 --> 41:25.934
You have an amazing
opportunity now

41:25.934 --> 41:28.084
You have an amazing
opportunity now

41:28.151 --> 41:29.619
to really turn
this restaurant around,

41:29.685 --> 41:33.089
but it requires both of you.

41:33.156 --> 41:36.592
Jerry, I thought you were
just some politician.

41:36.659 --> 41:38.361
You are a genuine leader.

41:38.428 --> 41:40.029
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you.
Great potential.

41:40.096 --> 41:42.565
Michael, a big heart,

41:42.632 --> 41:46.335
but you've got to focus
behind that line.

41:46.402 --> 41:48.438
If you stay focused
and master those dishes,

41:48.504 --> 41:50.239
you'll get there.

41:50.306 --> 41:53.409
I promise you, I will.
I promise you.

41:53.476 --> 41:54.377
Chef Ramsay came here,

41:54.544 --> 41:55.934
and I had the intentions

41:55.934 --> 41:55.978
and I had the intentions

41:56.045 --> 41:58.915
that he was gonna help put
this place back on track.

41:58.981 --> 42:01.784
I think he did more
than what I expected.

42:01.851 --> 42:04.821
I think he ignited my passion
in the kitchen again

42:04.887 --> 42:06.155
and put me closer
with my brother.

42:06.222 --> 42:07.523
This is what we needed.

42:07.590 --> 42:11.093
And look after each other.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.228
Good night.

42:16.332 --> 42:17.500
When I first arrived here,

42:17.567 --> 42:18.935
I was greeted
by a dead lobster

42:19.001 --> 42:20.603
and a restaurant
stuck in the '70s.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.104
And in just
a matter of days,

42:22.171 --> 42:24.474
the Spanish Pavillion
has been transformed.

42:24.540 --> 42:25.934
But this restaurant
will only succeed

42:25.934 --> 42:26.442
But this restaurant
will only succeed

42:26.509 --> 42:28.878
if those two brothers find
a way to stay united

42:28.945 --> 42:31.013
and work together.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.316
Big brother,
little brother.

42:34.884 --> 42:37.353
In the weeks that followed...

42:37.420 --> 42:39.355
Okay, take this
to table two.

42:39.422 --> 42:40.690
Jerry embraced his role
as expediter.

42:40.756 --> 42:41.824
Give me the frijoles.

42:41.891 --> 42:43.025
And is now devoting

42:43.092 --> 42:44.360
More time
to the restaurant.

42:44.427 --> 42:46.095
And I need a filet mignon,
medium well.

42:46.162 --> 42:47.597
You have that working,
right?

42:47.663 --> 42:49.232
Jerry, medium well.
I was waiting on you.

42:49.298 --> 42:50.500
Michael is staying
in the kitchen.

42:50.566 --> 42:52.134
Let's go. There you go.
There you go. There you go.

42:52.201 --> 42:53.369
And cooking full-time.

42:53.436 --> 42:55.104
Two steaks, medium rare.

42:55.171 --> 42:55.934
And the new menu is being
well-received

42:55.934 --> 42:57.206
And the new menu is being
well-received

42:57.273 --> 42:58.474
by the customers.

42:58.541 --> 43:00.343
The menu looks awesome.

43:00.409 --> 43:02.645
More importantly,
these brothers are united

43:02.712 --> 43:05.081
and carrying on
the successful legacy

43:05.147 --> 43:08.126
left to them
by their grandfather.
