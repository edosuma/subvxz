WEBVTT

00:06.630 --> 00:08.980
There she is.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.180
I can't believe you still volunteering

00:11.200 --> 00:13.200
at that airport information desk.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.090
I mean, what are those things even for?

00:15.270 --> 00:17.940
I'm gonna speak slowly so
that you can follow this.

00:18.020 --> 00:22.610
Information desks give
people information.

00:22.740 --> 00:26.280
Well, they should be called
"admit you're an idiot" desk.

00:26.410 --> 00:29.100
I mean, it's a airport.
They got signs everywhere.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.679
If you want to know where
Gate 5 is, guess what...

00:31.680 --> 00:35.410
it's between Gate 4 and Gate 6, idiot.

00:35.540 --> 00:36.690
You know what, Hank?

00:36.710 --> 00:39.100
Some people enjoy helping others.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.800
I'm not surprised you don't get it.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.300
You're only out for yourself.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.900
But I help people. I help
people all the time.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.600
Well, just now I was helping you
realize your job was stupid.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.680
I actually admire Hank.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.220
Thank you, Charlie.

00:53.260 --> 00:54.960
Yeah, most people would feel guilty

00:54.980 --> 00:57.279
about being so openly selfish.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.960
But not this guy.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.420
Actually, Hank, can you name

01:01.440 --> 01:03.600
the last time you
really helped somebody?

01:03.640 --> 01:07.110
Well, um, I helped someone, uh...

01:07.520 --> 01:11.680
Well, y-you remember that
time when-when-when...

01:11.740 --> 01:14.040
Well, just the other day, I, uh...

01:14.080 --> 01:16.000
Hey, look, here comes Sid.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.780
Wow.

01:17.790 --> 01:19.480
I cannot remember

01:19.500 --> 01:22.360
the last time someone
walked me to the door

01:22.380 --> 01:23.840
- after a date.
- Really?

01:23.920 --> 01:25.840
So you can't remember our last date

01:25.920 --> 01:28.380
and all the dates before that?

01:30.140 --> 01:32.420
The alarm goes off if the
door's propped open.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.600
They're really strict about the AC here.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.060
Mm. Makes sense. AC is... expensive.

01:40.240 --> 01:44.520
Especially when it's so hot.

01:48.110 --> 01:49.650
Call me later.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.570
Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.700
Only time will tell.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.370
Toodles.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.130
Wow.

02:05.210 --> 02:07.590
You are really into that guy.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.960
Who, John?

02:09.050 --> 02:11.020
Yes, John.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.620
You're head over heels.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.900
Which is a shorter distance
for you than for most,

02:14.930 --> 02:17.720
but still, it's really sweet.
When do we get to meet him?

02:17.810 --> 02:20.200
Well, I'm playing it cool.

02:22.580 --> 02:24.020
That's playing it cool?

02:24.070 --> 02:27.460
There are cooler guys
in my model train club.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.240
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.410
We're keeping it casual.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.150
Or I should say "caszh"

02:35.160 --> 02:38.160
because "casual" is not caszh enough.

02:38.180 --> 02:41.000
J-Just calm down. We're-we're
just happy for you.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.660
I mean, me and you both
in a relationship?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.520
This is... this is huge.

02:46.550 --> 02:49.540
Who said "relationship"?

02:49.560 --> 02:50.860
Did you say that? Don't say...

02:50.880 --> 02:53.120
No-Nobody's saying that. Don't say that!

02:53.140 --> 02:54.860
Sid, you're acting
like you've never been

02:54.890 --> 02:56.550
in a relationship before.

02:57.850 --> 03:01.020
You've never been in a
relationship before?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.690
Sid is a confirmed bachelor,

03:03.710 --> 03:06.400
just like my Uncle Ray
and his roommate...

03:06.480 --> 03:08.340
Christopher.

03:08.610 --> 03:11.990
I knew he wasn't sleeping on that futon.

03:36.970 --> 03:40.380
I can't believe you've never
been in a relationship, Sid.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.280
Of course, I barely know you.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.230
But still.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.690
Well, I mean, not a real one.

03:46.730 --> 03:50.690
Well, unless you count that
25-year marriage to a woman.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.240
Which I don't, because
that was based on a lie.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.990
Oh, dear. What was the lie?

03:56.070 --> 03:59.740
I'm gay, sweetie. Catch up.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.300
I'm just not good at relationships.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.740
Commitment scares me.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.540
The other day, John asked
me about my weekend plans,

04:08.560 --> 04:12.420
and I sent him a GIF of
a fat, clapping baby.

04:12.510 --> 04:15.780
Can Kathleen and I give you some
advice from a perfect couple

04:15.800 --> 04:17.200
that has stood the test of time?

04:17.220 --> 04:20.040
Oh, lord. You've been
dating for three weeks.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.120
I have milk older than that.

04:23.220 --> 04:26.580
Kathleen and I more than understand

04:26.600 --> 04:28.940
the thrill of the chase, the games.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.599
But when you stop with the games

04:31.600 --> 04:35.030
and you take the leap, that's
where the good stuff is.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.740
Now we're calling ourselves

04:36.860 --> 04:38.440
- "Charleen."
- Yeah.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.080
That's a combination of
Charlie and Kathleen.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.700
You're just brilliant.
I'm wild about you.

04:44.830 --> 04:48.080
Now, Sid, if you just want to hit
it and quit it, that's fine.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.760
I've been known to, uh,
toot it and scoot it.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.670
Tap it and scrap it.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.170
Hump it and bump it.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.050
But it seems like you
really like this John.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.300
I really, really do. But it's ju...

05:02.390 --> 05:04.810
Can we just talk about
something more fun, like...

05:04.890 --> 05:06.800
race relations?

05:06.820 --> 05:08.400
Okay, Sid, this is really simple.

05:08.420 --> 05:10.810
When you're with John, how
does he make you feel?

05:10.940 --> 05:13.940
He makes me feel...

05:14.070 --> 05:16.030
like cake.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.990
- And I love cake.
- Well, then,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.280
you better tell John
exactly how you feel

05:21.300 --> 05:23.240
before you lose that man cake.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.620
Cake man?

05:25.710 --> 05:29.290
And you are giving out
information at the airport.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.750
I'm a hollow reed.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.140
Trouble blows right through me.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.580
Are you okay?

05:43.180 --> 05:45.470
No, I'm fine. I'm just meditating.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.960
I was starting to think you
were scared of planes.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.100
Oh! Why would you think that?

05:50.190 --> 05:52.280
Well, every time one flies overhead,

05:52.300 --> 05:54.139
you do that "hollow reed" thing.

05:54.140 --> 05:57.440
Way off base there, Mitch.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.000
Well, good news, Margaret.

05:59.030 --> 06:00.780
You are gonna have some
help at the help desk.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.030
We've got a new volunteer.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.200
Oh, good.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.760
Oh, crap. What are you doing here?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.540
When you said I don't help
people, you were right.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.880
And I need you to be wrong, so now...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.880
I'm a servant of the people, baby.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.480
Step right up, stupid people

06:17.500 --> 06:20.340
who need obvious information
about the airport.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.520
I am a hollow reed.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.100
Trouble blows right through
me. I am a hollow reed.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.100
Oh, that sounded really big.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.100
Is this a menopause thing?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.040
What? No.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.650
I'm just... I'm a little...
I'm scared of planes.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.780
Then why are you working at the airport?

06:38.860 --> 06:41.400
This is where the planes live.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.640
My daughter's graduating
from beauty school

06:43.660 --> 06:45.080
this weekend in Boston,

06:45.100 --> 06:46.920
and I promised her
that I would be there,

06:46.950 --> 06:48.890
so that's why I'm working here.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.880
This is called immersion therapy.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.790
I just inch a little closer
to my fear every single day,

06:53.820 --> 06:56.580
and then, eventually, I
will set f-foot on a...

06:56.590 --> 06:58.520
a plane.

07:00.260 --> 07:01.820
Oh, stop laughing.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.780
This is why I didn't tell anybody.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.419
Listen, girl, I'm gonna help you,

07:05.420 --> 07:06.970
because that's what I do now.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.100
Excuse me, where's Gate 5?

07:09.120 --> 07:12.560
Probably between Gate
4 and Gate 6, genius!

07:12.640 --> 07:16.440
Another satisfied customer.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.460
Charlie, please help me.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.490
How do I get

07:24.510 --> 07:27.030
what you and Kathleen have?

07:27.080 --> 07:30.050
Well, that's like asking
to have what Pac-Man

07:30.080 --> 07:32.540
and Ms. Pac-Man have.

07:32.670 --> 07:35.670
No, you-you got to start
by opening up, Sid.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.710
Um, here, practice on me.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.170
I'm... Pretend I'm John.

07:39.210 --> 07:42.500
- Okay. John...
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.560
I don't know, this is hard.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.200
Well, if you can't say it to me,

07:46.210 --> 07:47.930
you'll never be able to say it to John.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.430
You're right. Okay, here goes.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.920
- John...
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.270
- I like you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:54.350 --> 07:57.900
I like you a lot. And I
want to be your boyfriend.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.690
- Pass.
- What?

07:59.730 --> 08:02.070
What? What? No, why did you do that?

08:02.150 --> 08:03.300
Well, what's the point of practicing

08:03.320 --> 08:05.490
if you can't do worst-case scenario?

08:05.570 --> 08:07.410
He could say no?

08:07.420 --> 08:10.740
Uh, yeah. That's the leap.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.280
I mean, you're putting
your heart out there.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.120
It could get kicked in the balls.

08:14.140 --> 08:16.850
I-I can't ask John to be my boyfriend

08:16.880 --> 08:18.710
if I don't know he's gonna say yes.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.960
- There has to be another way.
- Uh-huh, well, there isn't.

08:22.050 --> 08:25.480
Unless we lure him into a
bar under false pretenses,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.750
I strike up a conversation with him

08:27.780 --> 08:30.140
and ask him if he's sweet on somebody.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.600
Great. Let's do something like that.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.860
"Let's do something like that."

08:33.880 --> 08:37.280
I just offer you a
fully-formed, foolproof plan,

08:37.320 --> 08:39.309
and it's "Let's do something like that."

08:40.570 --> 08:42.230
Wow.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.420
- There he is.
- Yeah.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.130
Look at him, standing
there so tall and strong.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.020
I want to climb that man

09:04.080 --> 09:06.380
like a redwood.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.880
Well, yeah, he does look nice.

09:10.810 --> 09:13.600
He doesn't even look pissed
that you called him down here

09:13.620 --> 09:15.540
- and canceled on him.
- Do you really think

09:15.560 --> 09:18.420
you can find out if John like-likes me?

09:18.650 --> 09:22.590
Just relax, Sid. I worked
corporate espionage for years.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.830
If I can get the dirt
on Sully Sullenberger,

09:24.840 --> 09:26.440
I can get the dirt on this.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.570
You know, he aimed for those geese.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.740
Thank you.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.120
So, which branch of the military?

09:42.210 --> 09:43.290
Air Force.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.090
What gave it away, the posture?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.220
Yeah. No, the pectorals.

09:48.340 --> 09:51.180
I can always tell a military
man from the pectorals.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.560
Ah.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.100
Ah.

09:58.190 --> 10:01.400
How do you know when
you like-like someone?

10:03.110 --> 10:05.860
Are you still talking to me?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.800
No, I'm talking to these empty stools.

10:07.820 --> 10:10.020
Yes, silly, I am talking to you.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.280
I've got the hots for someone,

10:12.300 --> 10:14.550
and I can't tell if it's more than that.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.050
So, what-what would you
do in that situation?

10:17.060 --> 10:20.160
Could you just rattle off, say,
three things that you would do?

10:22.380 --> 10:25.290
Is there someone I could call for you?

10:25.380 --> 10:29.920
Come on. If two strangers
can't talk about love,

10:30.010 --> 10:31.930
the bad guys won.

10:32.010 --> 10:35.390
Look, I'm flattered, but I'm taken.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.400
Did you hear that?

10:44.440 --> 10:47.260
- He is taken.
- Mm-hmm.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.440
- That means I took him.
- Yep.

10:49.530 --> 10:52.570
He's like Liam Neeson,
or I'm like Liam Neeson.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.660
I can never remember the
plot of that thing.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.960
Oh, this is great. This is great.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.830
This means that I can take the leap,

10:58.870 --> 11:01.040
and John is gonna catch me.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.580
- What's the matter?
- Oh, um...

11:03.710 --> 11:07.090
Well, you know, I wasn't hitting on him.

11:07.210 --> 11:10.020
But if I was...

11:10.040 --> 11:11.630
I'm cute, right?

11:18.140 --> 11:19.860
All right, we're through security.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.480
- Just a half a block more.
- Ooh, ooh-ee. Okay.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.630
Okay. I think you've
gotten me close enough

11:25.660 --> 11:27.150
to the planes for one day.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.560
I think I'm breaking out in hives,

11:28.580 --> 11:30.820
and I have a severe case
of under-boob sweat.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.570
Uh, I-I think I need to
find a Purell station.

11:35.370 --> 11:38.180
Aren't you supposed to
take me to my gate?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.040
I'm gonna miss my flight.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.920
Your gate's right there, Brendan. Damn!

11:41.940 --> 11:44.000
No wonder your parents are
sending you to math camp.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.899
Okay, I need a break.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.130
We're getting too close to
the planes. They're so...

11:48.170 --> 11:50.630
so big and slow on the
ground and so fa-fast,

11:50.710 --> 11:52.550
so fast up in the air.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.360
Now you talking crazy.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.940
I'm gonna give you some
immersion therapy right now.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.500
You gonna take this kid to his gate.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.980
Brendan, hold this woman's
hand for support.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.400
- Oh.
- I'm eight!

12:04.420 --> 12:06.100
It's not for you, Brendan! Damn!

12:06.190 --> 12:08.500
Now I'm gonna go charge my
phone and get a chair massage.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.719
W-Well, Hank, you're
supposed to be helping me.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.320
I am helping you. Get
your life together! Bye.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.120
Oh, so close to plane.

12:18.140 --> 12:21.080
So itchy.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.930
Why are you so scared of planes anyway?

12:22.960 --> 12:25.580
You know you're more likely
to be in a car crash, right?

12:25.710 --> 12:28.540
Oh, wow, Brendan. I never heard of that.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.100
You got any more Snapple
cap wisdom for me?

12:31.130 --> 12:33.519
Let me ask you this. Have
you ever known anybody

12:33.520 --> 12:34.740
that was in a car crash?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.230
- Yeah.
- That's right,

12:36.260 --> 12:37.880
because you can walk away from them.

12:38.010 --> 12:39.640
You can't survive a plane crash.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.679
You have to stare death in the face

12:41.680 --> 12:43.780
as you plummet out of the sky

12:43.800 --> 12:47.270
and then you smash into the ground.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.820
Oh. I would be a pancake.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.780
You would be a mist.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.870
- Surprise!
- Ah.

13:00.950 --> 13:02.980
I thought before we went to dinner,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.450
we could enjoy this cake.

13:05.500 --> 13:10.040
Wow. I've never had cake
as an appetizer before.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
Well, I made it for us

13:13.880 --> 13:17.340
because I have something I
need to talk to you about.

13:18.050 --> 13:21.640
Ooh, how do I do this? Uh, oh, I'm...

13:21.760 --> 13:24.100
I'm just gonna be direct.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.810
John, as you may or may not know,

13:26.850 --> 13:31.060
many cultures celebrate
special moments with cake.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.779
- S... Sid.
- I think it was the late,

13:32.780 --> 13:33.899
great Harriet Tubman

13:33.900 --> 13:37.320
- who said cake is...
- Sid, I have to break things off.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.740
What?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.580
But aren't you... taken?

13:43.700 --> 13:47.260
Look, when you, uh,
stood me up last night,

13:47.380 --> 13:50.000
it just hit home for me that I can never

13:50.080 --> 13:52.130
get a read on you.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.500
Every time I mention the future, you...

13:54.550 --> 13:56.940
send me a fat, clapping baby.

13:56.980 --> 13:58.170
That's not true!

13:58.260 --> 14:00.620
One time, the baby was riding a Roomba.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.180
Remember the Roomba one?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.000
Yeah. I do remember.

14:05.020 --> 14:08.930
I had just asked you if you
wanted to meet my family.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.660
Look, you obviously see us
as casual, which is fine,

14:14.720 --> 14:18.410
and, um, a-a job popped up for me,

14:18.420 --> 14:21.530
and so I'm gonna go to
Atlanta for a few months.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.740
I leave tonight on the red-eye.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.790
Okay, uh...

14:27.850 --> 14:30.290
I get it.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.240
Got to chase that paper.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.330
Hotlanta!

14:34.820 --> 14:36.500
Same page.

14:36.590 --> 14:38.590
Super casual.

14:41.090 --> 14:42.800
Bye, Sid.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.420
Later, skater!

14:51.000 --> 14:53.230
I made that cake for myself!

15:05.240 --> 15:07.530
Oh, thank you for coming.

15:07.550 --> 15:09.850
He has been like this for hours.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.870
I keep thinking...

15:11.960 --> 15:14.340
the pain will subside,

15:14.400 --> 15:18.170
but it gets worse because I deserve...

15:18.300 --> 15:19.920
Oh, Sid.

15:20.010 --> 15:23.300
Why don't you try a less
complicated sentence?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.500
Okay. Why?

15:25.510 --> 15:28.350
Oh...

15:28.470 --> 15:31.390
This is your first real breakup, too.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.980
Isn't it just the worst?

15:34.060 --> 15:36.880
Doesn't it feel like you're
dead, only you're still alive?

15:36.900 --> 15:38.690
But 90-ten dead.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.440
Not helping, Charlie!

15:41.520 --> 15:43.240
Just empathize!

15:43.320 --> 15:46.760
I am! I mean, John rejected
me, too, you know.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.640
Sid,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.630
you've texted me 15 crying babies,

15:52.640 --> 15:56.290
each one fatter than the
last. What is going on?

15:56.340 --> 15:59.040
I didn't get your texts. My
phone was in airplane mode.

15:59.170 --> 16:03.090
By the way, I'm working at
the airport now, y'all.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.590
I ran John off with my games.

16:07.650 --> 16:10.430
I never told him how I felt,

16:10.520 --> 16:13.450
and now he's flying to Atlanta.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.100
He's flying?

16:15.190 --> 16:18.480
Oh, God, he's gonna be dead soon anyway.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.900
Enough!

16:20.030 --> 16:23.280
I have been silent long enough.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.500
You had been silent
for 30 seconds, tops.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.550
I know you don't think that
I am helpful or sensitive

16:30.580 --> 16:32.660
or even nice in any traditional way,

16:32.700 --> 16:35.500
but y'all about to get a
face-full of old Hank right now.

16:35.580 --> 16:38.269
Sid, you didn't even try to tell John

16:38.270 --> 16:39.630
how you really felt about him.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.500
If that man makes you feel like cake,

16:42.630 --> 16:44.480
you got to let him know!

16:45.080 --> 16:47.630
But, Hank, it's too late.
He's flying to Atlanta.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.040
His plane leaves in literally an hour.

16:50.060 --> 16:52.690
You waited 65 years

16:52.700 --> 16:54.599
to get into a relationship with a man,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.199
now you can't do a little long-distance?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.440
Wipe your face

16:58.460 --> 17:01.340
and get your big little
ass up off that couch,

17:01.360 --> 17:03.280
and go on and get your man!

17:03.360 --> 17:06.400
You could've just said, "Get
yourself off that couch."

17:06.470 --> 17:09.069
No need to talk about my ass.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.869
But you're right.

17:11.950 --> 17:13.839
Let's go to the airport.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.710
Oh, I'll drive! I like driving.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.539
Plus, you're the only
one that has a car.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.739
Oh, right.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.420
I just freaking love us.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.280
Well, looks like you got
this all under control,

17:25.300 --> 17:27.510
so I'll just stay here and
keep jamming on this cake.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.180
Like hell you will.
If I'm helping y'all,

17:30.260 --> 17:32.360
I'm doing it all at once
to get it over with.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.970
Come on, girl.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.900
This is John's gate.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.740
But he's not here.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.820
He must already be on the plane.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.850
Oh, well, we're too late. Sorry, Sid.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.640
But love comes around all the time.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.140
Wait a minute.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.120
You're not gonna get out of
this that easy, you chicken.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.450
The plane's still here.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.520
And with our red vests,
we can walk right on.

17:58.540 --> 18:01.040
Yoo-hoo! Information man,

18:01.170 --> 18:04.420
could you point me
towards baggage claim?

18:04.460 --> 18:07.170
Can you point me toward the most
annoying woman in the world?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.720
Oh, that's right. I just found her!

18:09.860 --> 18:12.550
Whoa. Did you just yell at this woman?

18:13.970 --> 18:16.510
Look, I've never had to fire

18:16.560 --> 18:18.770
a volunteer worker before, but um...

18:18.850 --> 18:20.810
yeah, stop coming here for free.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.360
And I'm gonna need that vest.

18:25.690 --> 18:29.780
You can take this non-job,
and you can shove it.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.400
Ma'am, baggage claim is this way.

18:31.530 --> 18:32.740
Thank you.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.680
They're about to close the doors.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.290
Well, it's all up to you now, Margaret.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.960
You're the only one that
can get on that plane

18:38.970 --> 18:40.400
and look for John.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.980
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.080
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:45.100 --> 18:46.500
Margaret.

18:46.590 --> 18:49.000
I need you.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.600
I'm okay.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.480
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.560
I'm... I'm okay.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.730
You'll tell us if we're
gonna take off, right?

19:05.750 --> 19:07.070
Okay...

19:07.150 --> 19:11.360
Oh. Hey, John. Cake man.

19:11.380 --> 19:15.620
Oh, God, did we just die?!

19:15.740 --> 19:18.790
Oh. Hi.

19:18.910 --> 19:22.080
I'm a hollow reed. Trouble
blows right through me.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.830
Is there someone I could call for you?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.210
Sid is here.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.400
I did it. I did it!

19:30.410 --> 19:33.760
I got on a friggin' airplane!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.800
Oh, and also, John is here.

19:36.930 --> 19:39.140
Sid, what's going on?

19:39.220 --> 19:42.430
I'm doing something I should
have done a long time ago.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.020
- Really, dating back to the '60s.
- Sid.

19:45.110 --> 19:47.060
They're holding the plane.

19:47.110 --> 19:50.060
Uh, I-I was playing it
cool. And I'm sorry.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.089
- The truth is...
- No, no, it-it...

19:51.090 --> 19:53.679
I've never been in a
relationship before,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.360
- and I was scared.
- Wait.

19:55.450 --> 19:58.780
You've never been in a
relationship before?

19:58.830 --> 20:01.490
John, they're holding the plane.

20:01.580 --> 20:04.160
Maybe I was scared my whole life,

20:04.170 --> 20:06.440
or maybe I've just never met someone...

20:06.520 --> 20:09.040
like you before.

20:09.130 --> 20:12.170
- Sir, the plane is leaving.
- Yeah.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.750
I-I want to be with you.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.510
I'll do long-distance.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.300
Uh, whatever it takes.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.480
I want to be with you, too.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.770
Let's do long-distance.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.780
I'll call you when we land.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.280
And I'll-I'll put you in my
telephone as "boyfriend."

20:38.410 --> 20:41.000
I'm in a relationship, y'all!

20:41.060 --> 20:44.789
Oh. Congratulations, Sid.
Doesn't it feel good?

20:44.790 --> 20:47.830
Yes, it...

20:49.090 --> 20:51.480
It's okay. It's a happy puke.

20:55.590 --> 20:58.690
So, this is gonna be my
first trip to Boston.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.470
I'm really excited to see my daughter,

21:00.480 --> 21:02.730
but I want to take in
some of the sights, too.

21:02.740 --> 21:04.919
I mean, it's Beantown, baby.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.640
Fenway Pahk.

21:06.730 --> 21:10.940
Pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.860
You know, these seats feel really solid.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.959
Flight crew, prepare for takeoff.

21:17.820 --> 21:21.070
Humans don't belong in the sky!

21:21.120 --> 21:24.240
This is a mass grave, make no mistake!

21:24.370 --> 21:28.040
We all bought one-way tickets to hell!
