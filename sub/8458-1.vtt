00:42.459 --> 00:47.422
In the middle of the night,
I have almost a nightmare.

00:47.548 --> 00:53.052
I wake up and I had forgotten
to nail shut the crate.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.221
So I go there, and
though it was raining...

00:56.473 --> 00:59.267
...I must have waked up the
whole neighbourhood, you know...

00:59.393 --> 01:02.353
...was not closing the box,
it was nailing the coffin.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.230
I am nailing the
coffin. I see it as that.

01:05.357 --> 01:08.151
Why, why this expression?
Why this thought?

01:08.277 --> 01:13.698
Well, maybe death is now looking through
the golden frame of this dream,...

01:13.824 --> 01:16.784
...and now reality is
going to choke me to death.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.371
Does it make any sense to conduct
surveillance when somebody knows about it?

01:20.497 --> 01:24.083
Now, I am Tuesday the 6th of August.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.545
The surveillance involved,
not what he was looking for...

01:27.584 --> 01:33.166
It was tense, but we were eager
to get going. Everything was ready.

01:34.803 --> 01:39.098
<i>...maintain surveillance, they
did so for security reasons,...</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:41.309
<i>...and I will not go beyond that.</i>

01:41.435 --> 01:44.437
<i>I have never obstructed justice,...</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:50.485
<i>...and, I think, too, that I could
say that in my years of public life...</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.737
<i>...that I welcome this
kind of examination,...</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:56.365
<i>...because people have gotta know
whether or not their Presidents a crook.</i>

01:56.492 --> 02:01.621
<i>Well, I am not a crook. I have
earned everything I have got.</i>

02:08.628 --> 02:11.422
Everybody was getting
more and more nervous.

02:11.548 --> 02:15.510
And finally, we were all
ready and said, "OK, lets go. "

02:15.636 --> 02:17.678
So we jump in the truck...

02:25.354 --> 02:29.857
Were not going to die,
were going to live.

02:34.534 --> 02:39.870
I remember the extremely
tense silence in the van.

02:44.778 --> 02:47.269
Alan was absolutely sombre,...

02:47.380 --> 02:49.371
...Philippe extremely tense.

02:49.416 --> 02:53.352
Annie As for me I was
petrified very worried.

02:56.323 --> 03:00.191
I was disguised as a workman
with a helmet, a shirt...

03:00.227 --> 03:03.390
Jean-Francois To look like an American,
I had lot of pens in my pocket.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.330
Thats typically American, apparently.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.609
I was gonna be on the
crew in the South Tower.

03:13.735 --> 03:19.740
We were gonna go at closing time with
a big hamper, with all the gear in it.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.243
There were gonna be some
guys in the North Tower,...

03:22.369 --> 03:26.330
...dressed for business
with much less gear,...

03:26.456 --> 03:30.751
...an architects tube... and I
believe that was holding the bow.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.379
Electricity in the air
between Jean-Louis and Albert.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.757
I can read it in Jean-Louis
face, he doesnt trust Albert.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.760
I had a bad feeling, er, there
is something wrong with this guy.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.514
He is not at all on the
same... track that we are.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.601
Fear was in the air.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.229
I assumed that even in the
best possible situation...

03:50.355 --> 03:52.356
...that we were all
going to be arrested.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.567
There was no doubt of that.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.989
I cant imagine how they
didn't feel the same way.

04:02.492 --> 04:07.246
I felt that the horizontality of driving
through the streets of Manhattan...

04:07.372 --> 04:08.623
...suddenly became slant.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.793
I was on the ramp. I was
being engulfed by the monster.

04:14.935 --> 04:17.165
And Philippe said to me: "I
know whats going to happen...

04:17.202 --> 04:19.466
...we are going to go in, and
were going to get caught. "

04:21.762 --> 04:26.766
It was suddenly not a dream
any more. It was tangible.

04:28.815 --> 04:33.809
He could no longer carry on living
without having at least tried to...

04:35.589 --> 04:37.921
...to conquer those towers

04:37.958 --> 04:40.825
because it felt like those
towers belonged to him.

04:42.495 --> 04:44.793
It was as if they had been
built especially for him.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.851
"Once upon a time... "

05:51.977 --> 05:57.815
Now, thats how you start fairytales,
and actually my story is a fairytale.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.948
Here I am, young, 17 years
old, with a bad tooth,...

06:06.074 --> 06:10.578
...in one of those uncolourful
waiting rooms of a French dentist,...

06:10.704 --> 06:13.372
...and its really lit
with a little 40-watt bulb.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.750
And you have old ladies
and people, you know,...

06:15.876 --> 06:20.004
...sheepishly looking at magazines,
its quiet, and suddenly I freeze.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.549
Because I have opened
a newspaper at a page...

06:23.675 --> 06:25.551
...and I see something magnificent,

06:25.677 --> 06:28.846
something that inspires
me, I see two towers.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.016
And the article says, "One day
those towers will be built. "

06:32.142 --> 06:33.768
They're not even there yet.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.272
And when they are, they will
become the highest in the world.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.693
Now, I need to have that, this
little tangible start of my dream,...

06:42.819 --> 06:45.696
...but everybody is watching
and... but I need that page.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.657
So what I do is, under the
cover of sneeze... Aaah!

06:48.784 --> 06:52.703
I tear the page, put it
under my jacket and go out.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.831
Now, of course, I would have
a toothache for a week,...

06:55.957 --> 07:00.669
...but whats the pain, in comparison
that now I have acquired my dream?

07:02.839 --> 07:06.008
Usually, when you have a dream, the
object of your dream is tangible.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.636
Its there. Its... its quixotic,...

07:08.762 --> 07:12.431
...but its there, nagging
you, you know, confronting you.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.934
But the object of my
dream doesnt exist yet.

08:28.154 --> 08:29.781
I was twenty years old.

08:29.823 --> 08:35.022
And I was a painfully shy young girl.

08:38.298 --> 08:40.823
I was very surprised
by this individual...

08:44.671 --> 08:49.301
...and even more surprised when he
began to chase me relentlessly,...

08:49.342 --> 08:52.641
...having just met me.

08:53.713 --> 08:57.308
He would bring me flowers,
arrange little dates,...

08:57.350 --> 09:00.046
...send me love letters.

09:00.286 --> 09:04.086
I was completely overwhelmed,...

09:04.123 --> 09:08.389
...bowled over, harpooned,
that's what it was.

09:12.999 --> 09:16.457
He introduced me to his wire.

09:16.502 --> 09:19.164
A wire set up at the end of a garden.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.238
I would spend hours watching him walk.

09:23.376 --> 09:25.105
He wasn't that experienced at the time.

09:25.144 --> 09:27.305
He was just beginning his
life as a tightrope walker.

09:37.390 --> 09:39.483
We became inseparable.

09:39.525 --> 09:41.925
In fact my life was
completely consumed by his.

09:41.961 --> 09:45.761
And he never thought to ask me
whether I had my own destiny to follow.

09:45.798 --> 09:48.130
It was quite clear I had to follow his.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.978
Annie, who knows me
better than everybody,...

10:04.104 --> 10:08.232
...Annie, who was at my side
during my discovery of the wire,...

10:08.358 --> 10:11.902
...whose large, green eyes move me.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.948
When we embrace, we
look like two kids...

10:16.074 --> 10:18.951
...plotting our next piece of mischief.

10:27.252 --> 10:31.088
I started as a young,
self-taught wirewalker,

10:31.214 --> 10:36.010
To dream of... not so much
conquering the universe,...

10:36.136 --> 10:40.139
...but as a poet
conquering beautiful stages.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.235
One day he said,...

10:53.361 --> 10:56.989
"I really would like to
put a wire on Notre Dame. "

10:57.866 --> 11:03.203
At first I thought it was a joke,
but in the meantime, I knew...

11:03.330 --> 11:06.957
I knew that there was something
a little bit real about it,...

11:07.083 --> 11:10.878
...and then we started to
talk more and more about it.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.881
And then we started to plan it.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.546
It took about a year to
find the right way to do it.

11:18.324 --> 11:20.884
Jean-Louis had told me right
away that it was illegal.

11:20.927 --> 11:23.452
Jean-Francois Accomplice

11:23.496 --> 11:26.795
So I knew it was illegal, but of
course that's what got me a bit excited!

11:27.633 --> 11:31.729
Against the law, but not wicked or mean.

11:31.771 --> 11:33.363
It was wonderful!

11:33.406 --> 11:35.365
Notre Dame Cathedral Paris, June 1971

11:35.695 --> 11:38.197
Can you imagine, you wake up
in the morning in the city...

11:38.323 --> 11:43.285
...and all of a sudden you see a
high-wirewalker between... Notre Dame?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.204
Its a dream.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.627
Thats what really attracts me.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.631
Its the challenge of doing something
thats supposed to be impossible.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.134
And, in the meantime, doing
something thats so beautiful...

11:59.260 --> 12:03.138
...that not only doesnt hurt anybody,
but gives something to somebody.

12:04.070 --> 12:07.335
Then Philippe appeared on the wire.

12:07.373 --> 12:09.307
It was amazing.

12:16.916 --> 12:19.384
I went inside, all excited,...

12:19.419 --> 12:25.881
...and I leant over the nave
and saw that a huge ceremony

12:25.925 --> 12:27.654
was taking place in Notre Dame.

12:31.631 --> 12:36.466
There were a dozen or so priests
dressed all in white, arm crossed.

12:36.502 --> 12:39.938
They were lying on the floor,
their heads against the floor.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.037
I was staggered, dumbstruck.

12:45.711 --> 12:49.169
The organist asked me:
"What are you doing here?"

12:49.215 --> 12:52.548
I said to him: "There's a
wirewalker up there on the towers!"

12:53.086 --> 12:55.987
This gentleman looked at me
with an expression of wonder...

12:56.022 --> 12:57.853
...and he said; "Oh,
really! A wirewalker!

12:57.890 --> 12:59.824
How amazing!"

13:39.398 --> 13:43.459
South Tower 3.58pm

13:44.370 --> 13:46.838
We drove the van inside.

13:46.873 --> 13:50.707
We got through the
first security barrier.

13:51.544 --> 13:56.743
We presented the company
documents and the fake invoices.

13:56.782 --> 13:59.250
Everything was quite carefully planned.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.174
And now we were horizontal again,...

14:02.300 --> 14:06.136
...we were driving in the
subterranean garage of the two towers.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.264
And we were going. I
knew the plan. Ha ha!

14:09.390 --> 14:15.354
We were going to the freight
elevator of the South Tower.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.607
It was... the whole
plan was in the making.

14:20.406 --> 14:24.137
North Tower 4.25pm

14:24.614 --> 14:27.199
The basic plan was very simple.

14:27.325 --> 14:33.622
We had ID cards, so it was just a matter
of kind of pushing our way through.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.919
Once wed gotten in the buildings...
it was pretty smooth sailing.

14:43.196 --> 14:45.164
The time had come for us to part.

14:45.198 --> 14:50.898
There was a real madness
in his eyes, a real rage.

14:53.072 --> 14:56.473
It was truly: " I'm going to do this,
no matter what, now is the time".

14:57.243 --> 15:01.907
And he held me in his arms as if
we would never see each other again.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.571
If I die, what a beautiful death.

15:05.697 --> 15:09.366
To die in the... in the
exercise of your passion.

15:11.757 --> 15:17.024
Sydney, Australia June 1973

16:38.247 --> 16:42.626
We broke into the Sydney Harbour
Bridge pylon one night,...

16:42.752 --> 16:45.545
...carried all this equipment
in, put a tightrope up,...

16:45.672 --> 16:48.715
...disappeared in the morning
and then sat down on the street

16:48.841 --> 16:51.635
...and watched Philippe
walk backwards and forwards.

17:10.696 --> 17:15.659
The fact that the wirewalking
activity is framed by death,...

17:15.785 --> 17:19.788
...its great because then you
have to take it very seriously.

17:19.914 --> 17:24.376
Its a little half a
millimetre of mistake...

17:24.502 --> 17:27.838
...or a quarter of a second of
inattention, and you lose your life.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.652
This is the Sydney Harbour Bridge
and the traffic was backed up.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.946
The police came, of
course, within minutes.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.509
When he was taken away,...

18:14.635 --> 18:18.847
...the first thing he did was
he picked the policemans watch.

18:18.973 --> 18:23.059
Philippe manages to take the
guys watch off his wrist...

18:23.519 --> 18:25.771
...and hide it in his pocket!

18:42.872 --> 18:46.041
These Twin Towers are
trotting in my head.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.085
You know, Im galloping in my brain.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.761
As Im back to Paris, slap in the face.

18:57.887 --> 19:02.057
"Paris Match", double page,
"The Twin Towers are built. "

19:03.100 --> 19:07.646
But right now the picture tells me
that those beams are not still covered.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.773
The things are not
painted. I see workers.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.693
I imagine maybe for a few more
months, or a year, who knows?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.287
Its in construction and I can sneak in.

19:15.367 --> 19:21.931
One day he showed me a photo
of two buildings in a magazine.

19:22.842 --> 19:25.310
And then I was a bit frightened.

19:27.379 --> 19:32.715
It was inhuman to want to go and
walk up there, 450 meters high.

19:32.885 --> 19:36.651
This was all becoming demonic.
I just wanted to say: "Stop!"

19:37.256 --> 19:41.784
Barry Greenhouse "The Inside Man"

19:43.558 --> 19:49.688
The plan was for me to bring all
my equipment to the 82nd floor,...

19:49.814 --> 19:51.690
...which was Barrys hiding place.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.276
There was one in each
tower, the same floor.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.404
And to put all the equipment there,
using the freight elevator,...

19:57.530 --> 20:00.824
...saying, "Delivery for 82nd floor. "
And Barry will be there to receive, OK.

20:00.950 --> 20:05.412
At the time, I was an Assistant
Director of Research...

20:05.538 --> 20:07.747
...at The New York State
Insurance Department.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.709
Wed just moved in, and
I was on what was then...

20:10.835 --> 20:14.546
...the highest occupied floor
in Two World Trade Center.

20:21.554 --> 20:25.640
I knew there was gonna
be a team in each tower...

20:25.766 --> 20:28.435
...and that the stuff was
gonna be delivered to me.

20:28.561 --> 20:32.397
Then it was gonna be carried
up... wouldve been 28 floors.

20:32.523 --> 20:37.527
The operator of the freight elevator
had not completely heard the foreman...

20:37.653 --> 20:39.654
...shouting, "82nd floor!"

20:39.780 --> 20:43.450
And it was clearly on our delivery
bill and on all the package.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.911
He asked to the group,
"What floor again?"

20:46.037 --> 20:50.373
Right there, I think, this is
it, and I said clearly, "104!"

20:50.499 --> 20:56.880
"OK, whatever. Watch your hands,"
and cling, the gate clanked shut.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.056
Now we are in a plywood box, in
a temporary freight elevator,...

21:06.182 --> 21:08.058
...going all the way up,...

21:08.184 --> 21:12.479
...and its dark, its a...
its a travel towards heaven.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.898
And the darkness becomes grey,...

21:15.024 --> 21:18.068
...and I see a square of
grey that becomes lighter.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.112
I see a square of light. It is the sky.

21:21.238 --> 21:27.994
Were getting there and were arriving
just a few floors below the roof...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.663
...with all our equipment.

21:29.789 --> 21:34.542
Annie came to my office and
told me that they had,...

21:34.669 --> 21:37.587
...by a great stroke of fortune,...

21:37.713 --> 21:40.757
...gotten on the freight elevator

21:40.883 --> 21:46.554
and saved themselves 20 floors
of carrying up all that equipment.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.975
Now, I find myself in
a deserted floor, 104,...

21:50.101 --> 21:55.188
...and the first thing we do is
unpack and take equipment out.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.109
Suddenly, I hear a guard coming.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.529
I just look and I see over there a tarp.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.740
So I just grab Jean-FranΓ§ois
and I throw him underneath,...

22:05.866 --> 22:07.667
...and I hear
Jean-FranΓ§ois yell, "Argh!"

22:07.706 --> 22:11.142
This beam was over the elevator
shaft that had a drop of 400 meters.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.712
"What? Were going under it?"
Yeah, we had to hide under a tarp.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.798
Donald starts saying, "Hold on my
leg, hold on this, where can I go?"

22:21.924 --> 22:24.843
And I kind of like... right
on the spur of the moment said,

22:24.969 --> 22:28.179
"You know what, man? I cant do this. "

22:29.181 --> 22:32.976
And hes like, "OK, go ahead. "

22:33.102 --> 22:37.856
"Go quick!" I think, who was the more
happy, Donald or I? Anyway, bye-bye, Donald!

22:37.982 --> 22:40.191
Unbridled glee.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.778
Im so happy to not have to do this.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.073
Im running down the stairs, 110 flights.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.618
Its like those dreams
where you never touch down.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.954
Itwas so beautiful.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.964
So here we are under the
tarp, frozen to death.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.468
I dont have to mumble to
Jean-FranΓ§ois, "Dont move. "

23:06.594 --> 23:10.221
He feels it in our body... connection.

23:10.931 --> 23:14.642
And now the guard comes. Has he seen us?

23:16.979 --> 23:21.566
Has he heard us? Has
he seen the tarp move?

23:21.692 --> 23:25.236
But the guard comes and leans
against the structure,...

23:25.362 --> 23:29.157
...and he seems to be a foot away.

23:29.283 --> 23:33.620
I hear the cracking of his walkie-talkie,
and I hear he takes a cigarette.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.123
The sound close-up now of the
lighter and of his first puff,...

23:37.249 --> 23:41.002
...the burning of the extremity
of the cigarette and the...

23:41.128 --> 23:44.255
He seems to be almost leaning on my ear.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.217
So, we are, I mean,
frozen. We dont breathe.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.312
We wait for 6, 6:30.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.776
So we start to climb.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.949
We saw nobody in the stairway,
nobody underneath the roof.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.243
Seems pretty safe.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.891
All of a sudden, we hear
somebody coming from the stairway.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.602
So, we are scared like hell.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.606
So we run to the hiding place
and we jump in the hiding place.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.569
We hear some steps. We hear
the walkie-talkie noise.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.621
And the noises were very confusing.

24:58.747 --> 25:02.292
Sometimes, you dont hear
the guy for 10 minutes.

25:02.418 --> 25:06.004
So, you think hes gone.
All of a sudden you hear...

25:06.130 --> 25:08.965
You hear him coughing or you
hear a talkie-walkie noise,...

25:09.091 --> 25:14.971
...like hes right next to the
hiding place, so we could not talk.

25:19.435 --> 25:23.938
We started to write little notes.

25:24.064 --> 25:29.152
We kept saying, "Do you think
now Yeah? Lets wait longer. "

25:29.278 --> 25:31.738
It was uncomfortable, but... you know

25:31.864 --> 25:33.990
Once you understand
you dont have a choice,

25:34.116 --> 25:36.993
you try to settle in and just wait.

25:41.123 --> 25:44.876
At that point, were in
suits. In business suits.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.629
Being in a business suit
with heavy equipment,...

25:47.755 --> 25:51.341
...hiding behind a pile of boxes,
I mean, there is no explanation.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.385
If we were caught at
that time, that was it.

26:07.107 --> 26:11.027
What if the guard is still
around, toying with us,

26:11.153 --> 26:15.740
waiting for us to make the slightest
movement before he pounces on us?

26:15.866 --> 26:18.368
We must wait.

26:18.494 --> 26:23.081
To ease the torment, I
return to my memories.

26:23.207 --> 26:28.169
The gold and mud, years of dreaming,...

26:28.295 --> 26:31.422
...months of organising.

26:31.548 --> 26:36.344
I dive back into the
past for a long while.

26:38.681 --> 26:42.517
That it will indeed serve
the purposes intended

26:42.643 --> 26:47.146
and that it will truly promote not
only harmony between the states,

26:47.273 --> 26:53.194
but harmony and communication
between the nations of the world.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.947
Itwas in January of 1974.

26:56.073 --> 27:01.369
I climbed on the roof of my little house
and screamed, "Im coming to America!"

27:18.345 --> 27:22.390
And the minute I got out of the subway,
climbing the steps, looking at them,

27:22.516 --> 27:24.726
I knew that they were no dream.

27:25.185 --> 27:29.314
I knew that it was... My
dream was destroyed instantly.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.405
Impossible. Impossible.
Impossible. Its clearly impossible.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.450
Not only to walk across this high,
I probably hardly thought of it,

27:40.576 --> 27:44.162
but to bring almost like a
ton of equipment secretly,

27:44.288 --> 27:46.914
to rig a wire for
hours, to guy-line it,

27:47.041 --> 27:51.252
its clearly out of human scale.

27:52.087 --> 27:57.258
But something in me pulls
me toward touching it.

28:01.259 --> 28:04.126
Jim Moore

28:05.267 --> 28:10.146
Thats when he spoke to
me about his project.

28:10.272 --> 28:15.526
He said, "Well, I want to string a wire
between the two World Trade Center Towers. "

28:15.652 --> 28:18.946
I said, "OK, sounds wild. "

28:19.073 --> 28:22.075
I mean, Id never met a
high-wirewalker before,

28:22.201 --> 28:26.329
so I had no idea what... nor did I
even entertain the idea at the time

28:26.455 --> 28:30.041
of what the consequences of
anything happening would be.

28:30.167 --> 28:33.252
It just sounded like a really
fun adventure to get involved in.

28:33.379 --> 28:37.632
So I took it upon myself to say,
"Sure, lets... lets work on it. "

28:37.758 --> 28:40.635
The first occasion we
went up in the elevator,

28:40.761 --> 28:42.929
we took the elevator to the 86th floor.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.598
When we got off, there
was a guard there.

28:45.724 --> 28:50.103
He said, "What are you doing here?"
So, obviously, we couldnt continue.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.064
So we took the elevator
back down and then realised,

28:53.190 --> 28:57.443
"Well, lets just walk up. "

28:57.569 --> 29:02.156
Then we proceeded to climb
up the 110 flights to the top.

29:08.205 --> 29:13.292
We are at the top of the world.

29:13.419 --> 29:19.382
I see two slabs of concrete, barely
inhabited, with some construction.

29:19.508 --> 29:24.011
No fence, no net, no nothing,
and... and I am frozen to death.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.309
I see the other tower and
I... I imagine the void.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.980
And if I were to run... on the slab,

29:34.106 --> 29:37.400
I will just fall to another life.

29:44.700 --> 29:49.704
And slowly I thought, "OK, its impossible.
Thats sure. So lets start working. "

29:49.830 --> 29:52.039
We took pictures of all
these things, thinking,

29:52.166 --> 29:58.337
"Perhaps thats where the cable might be
tied, or may be a cable we could use. "

29:58.464 --> 30:03.426
He wasnt sure how he was gonna
rig it at that particular time.

30:03.552 --> 30:08.097
I decided in the staircase
to draw a little fresco,...

30:09.892 --> 30:13.186
...as if I needed some tangible proof...

30:13.312 --> 30:16.355
...to show me that I was going
through different steps...

30:16.482 --> 30:21.402
...and approaching the impossible of
actually finding myself on that wire.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.495
I even rented a helicopter
at some point,...

30:30.621 --> 30:34.499
...and Jim was with me taking pictures
of the roof, of the equipment there,...

30:34.625 --> 30:37.168
...for making a model, for measuring.

30:37.294 --> 30:42.590
But I also wanted a little
bit to see if it was possible.

30:43.509 --> 30:47.512
He wanted to get higher than where he
was gonna be when he walked on the wire.

30:47.638 --> 30:52.558
It was a way of tricking his
mind into not feeling fear

30:52.684 --> 30:56.229
by being higher than where he was
gonna be when he actually did the walk.

30:56.355 --> 31:01.192
One day I received a postcard with a "W
- World Trade Center".

31:01.318 --> 31:04.403
I never heard about
the WTC at that time,

31:04.530 --> 31:09.242
and he had drawn a little
wire on top of the towers.

31:09.368 --> 31:13.329
I thought, "Of course, thats why
these towers are there: for Philippe!"

31:14.623 --> 31:16.707
So, now I go back to France.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.126
The minute I arrive,
I didnt even go home.

31:19.253 --> 31:24.423
I run to Jean-Louis, my old friend,
and I said, "I have a new idea. "

31:25.300 --> 31:28.261
This, we knew that
legally we could not do it.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.056
I mean, nobody knew...
knew Philippe Petit.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.141
Nobody knew us, you
go there and you ask,

31:34.268 --> 31:38.354
"Can I put a wire on top of the World
Trade Center?" Theyd say, "Get out. "

31:40.607 --> 31:43.568
So I tried to get
information from Philippe.

31:43.694 --> 31:44.944
"So you have been there,

31:45.070 --> 31:48.864
"you told me you have been ten times
on the top, but what did you get as...

31:48.991 --> 31:50.866
"... what do we have as information?"

31:50.993 --> 31:53.869
"But I have pictures, look,
and we can put the wire...

31:53.996 --> 31:57.748
"... I dont know where to put it but
well find out with the pictures. "

31:57.874 --> 32:00.001
This is the best.

32:00.065 --> 32:03.159
A minute ago you said the whole
place was swarming with cops.

32:03.201 --> 32:05.999
This is what they'll make
you do when you're prison.

32:06.504 --> 32:09.439
They'll make you clean the
windows in all the tall towers.

32:10.053 --> 32:14.599
I started to do... er... a
little recap in my head,...

32:14.725 --> 32:16.976
...and I found out we had nothing.

32:17.102 --> 32:21.772
Hes not driven by the impetuous
feeling of dancing between the towers.

32:21.898 --> 32:25.943
He is driven by, "Im gonna help Philippe.
I dont want to help him to kill himself.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.572
"I dont want to be caught there, and we
want to succeed, we dont want to fail. "

32:29.698 --> 32:33.784
So for plenty of reasons that are
actually noble and understandable,

32:33.910 --> 32:37.830
he becomes almost the...
We fight a lot on... on...

32:37.956 --> 32:42.084
"You dont have enough elements,
Philippe, to build up a serious plan. "

32:42.961 --> 32:47.173
So now I go back and this is
the second visit to America.

32:51.928 --> 32:55.014
Now I spend my time
spying on the Twin Towers.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.767
With all my might. I go day and night.

32:57.893 --> 33:03.814
I note things and fill the exercise books
with all those notes and little doodlings,

33:03.940 --> 33:09.612
...and I look at what commercial vehicles
go underneath for freight delivery.

33:09.738 --> 33:13.658
I go in. I find a way at
lunch time to disguise myself.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.163
The workers seem to
arrive in normal cars...

33:20.082 --> 33:24.835
At some point, I am so much into
taking notes as a spy around the Towers,

33:24.961 --> 33:26.962
I dont see its a construction site,

33:27.089 --> 33:32.051
I dont see one nail
sticking out of one plank.

33:32.177 --> 33:38.724
So, right there, the big nail goes
through my sole. Three days in bed.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.270
So, here I am with crutches.
Thinking I am incapacitated.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.856
No, no, no, no. Its the opposite.

33:45.982 --> 33:49.944
Its wonderful, a human being with
crutches. The Universe is his!

33:50.070 --> 33:53.948
The guards, you know, help me, "Can
I help you? Let me hold the door. "

33:54.074 --> 33:57.159
People, you know, "Sit down, take
your time. " Nobody asks me for an ID,

33:57.285 --> 34:00.955
...nobody says, "What are you doing
here?" I... I have this fabulous...

34:01.081 --> 34:04.041
So then now, even though my
foot is about to be repaired,...

34:04.167 --> 34:06.711
...I use the crutches a lot. OK?

34:06.837 --> 34:10.130
And sometimes you would see the man
leaving his crutches and running around...

34:10.257 --> 34:14.260
...to measure something and coming
back and being with crutches!

34:33.071 --> 34:36.114
One time we went up there,
it was very, very windy,...

34:36.241 --> 34:40.286
...and I... I actually wasnt
sure why we were going up there.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.748
I barely had the courage to get
out of my little trap door,...

34:44.875 --> 34:47.918
...and Jim, hanging on, I dont know how,

34:48.043 --> 34:51.130
managed to take a picture
of me hanging on to a post...

34:51.255 --> 34:55.134
...at the very roof of the tower,
with my body almost horizontally.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.970
The wind was blowing me away.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.055
- So, what if...?
- Very scary.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.058
That was may be one of the first times
I realised how crazy it was up there...

35:03.185 --> 35:07.021
...with that kind of condition and the
height and what we were involved in.

35:07.147 --> 35:10.274
What happens if Im up there and
I rig it and something happens?

35:10.400 --> 35:14.987
I started thinking about those things and
when we got closer to the actual event,

35:15.113 --> 35:18.032
I basically said, "No, I
cant... I cant help you rig.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.284
"I cant be part of that
team that goes to the top. "

35:39.250 --> 35:41.813
South Tower 8. 10pm

35:42.182 --> 35:43.849
Here we are,...

35:43.975 --> 35:47.561
...underneath the top of the
World Trade Center, under a tarp.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.983
Each time we would hear a noise,
it was very hard to tell...

35:53.109 --> 35:55.236
...if it was a cardboard
board flapping in the wind...

35:55.362 --> 35:57.363
...or a guard coming,
or a walkie-talkie.

36:03.286 --> 36:08.040
I drilled a little hole with a paperclip,
and I enlarged this hole in the canvas

36:08.166 --> 36:11.669
with a conical end of a ball-point pen.

36:14.339 --> 36:20.135
And then with one eye I was able to
see a little bit of the ambient light...

36:20.262 --> 36:22.221
...going onto the figure of my watch.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.142
What time is it? Is it dark outside?

36:27.269 --> 36:30.855
Oh, I heard noise, lets
try to go out of the tarp.

36:32.837 --> 36:36.705
His foot was up my nose...

36:36.741 --> 36:38.936
...and my foot was stuck
between his arms,...

36:38.977 --> 36:40.569
...we were completely entwined.

36:42.113 --> 36:44.479
I guess you could say we
really got to know each other.

36:44.516 --> 36:47.178
I've rarely known a man that way before!

36:50.959 --> 36:55.255
We kept hearing more and more noise from
the roof. Like voices, like machines.

36:55.322 --> 36:56.292
North Tower 9.38pm

36:56.381 --> 37:00.050
Sometimes, far away.
Sometimes, very close.

37:00.176 --> 37:03.387
But really like somebody
was walking on the roof.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.931
Gee, if they are working at night,...

37:06.057 --> 37:10.227
...we are stuck, I mean, there
is no chance the coup will happen.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.898
The longer we waited
and the longer we hid,...

37:14.024 --> 37:17.192
...the less time wed have to do
what we had to do to get up there.

37:17.319 --> 37:22.114
There was tension. I thought that
we were both out of our element.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.910
That neither of us really
should have been there.

37:26.036 --> 37:29.204
There is something that
I dont trust in this guy.

37:29.331 --> 37:33.667
Hes not deeply concerned
by anything. Why is he here?

37:42.807 --> 37:44.470
Mark "The Australian"

37:44.554 --> 37:48.515
When I finished university I flew to
Paris and I caught up with Philippe,...

37:48.642 --> 37:51.226
...and he showed me this
extraordinary sort of diagram

37:51.353 --> 37:55.314
...and this photograph of this building
that was being constructed in New York.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.025
This is a big one now.
And the wire, a big one.

37:58.944 --> 38:02.154
You know, I looked at
this huge tower or towers,

38:02.280 --> 38:05.407
and Philippe was just so
enthusiastic about doing this.

38:05.533 --> 38:11.288
So, er... I became, I guess, one
of the first members of the team.

38:33.603 --> 38:37.314
I intend on a giant meadow,
its a giant, giant field,

38:37.440 --> 38:41.944
to reproduce, not two roofs of the World
Trade Center, I dont have the money for that,

38:42.070 --> 38:45.155
but just the outline and practise!

38:48.806 --> 38:50.569
He wanted to set up a wire

38:50.608 --> 38:53.543
to correspond exactly to the
distance between the two towers.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.936
And to practice on
it a much as he could.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.130
Even if I miss, it doesnt matter.

39:01.256 --> 39:05.259
We had, I guess, a little bit of
a boot camp or a training camp.

39:05.385 --> 39:11.015
Essentially we spent time there
conceiving, er... designing,

39:11.141 --> 39:14.435
trying to work out how to make
this thing work from every aspect.

39:17.769 --> 39:22.706
Someone had spoken to him about
the elasticity of the building

39:23.541 --> 39:27.841
and the fact that the wind
could cause the towers to sway.

39:28.379 --> 39:31.405
So there was a moment of great concern.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.581
So I asked my friends
to make the cable dance.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.043
And here is Mark the Australian,
here is Jean-Louis, Annie.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.336
We would jump up and
down on these wires.

39:41.463 --> 39:45.340
Wed try and bounce
Philippe off of the wire.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.690
The World Trade Center
was extraordinary,

40:01.816 --> 40:04.735
because it was 200
feet between the towers,

40:04.861 --> 40:09.198
so how do you get a tightrope
from one tower to the other?

40:10.158 --> 40:13.368
Look what you will
see. Like that? Ha ha!

40:13.495 --> 40:16.205
We have to find a way
to throw something,

40:16.331 --> 40:20.042
then you can pull a little string and
then a bigger string and then a rope,

40:20.168 --> 40:24.379
and then eventually the wire.

40:24.506 --> 40:30.594
At some point, I mean, I thought even
of a little airplane, radio guided.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.640
Football and baseball, we have
to learn how to play baseball

40:34.766 --> 40:38.477
for two months before we
can do that. No, no, no.

40:38.603 --> 40:42.231
At some point, Jean-Louis came
up with a really silly idea.

40:42.357 --> 40:46.819
I dont even let him finish his sentence, he
says, "Philippe, what about a bow and arrrr...?"

40:48.238 --> 40:52.116
We drilled a very small hole in
the... in the end of an arrow,

40:52.242 --> 40:56.411
and we attached a monofilament or
a fishing line wire to the arrow.

40:56.538 --> 41:00.124
The whole idea would be that
Jean-Louis would, you know,

41:00.250 --> 41:02.334
send the arrow from
one building to another.

41:02.460 --> 41:08.298
Then, of course, whenever we
tried it... it just didnt work.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.704
Its pretty useless. Make a proper one.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.418
In the end we designed a spool
that had a conical shape on it,

41:44.544 --> 41:49.381
so that the monofilament would unravel
and go very freely through the air.

42:07.817 --> 42:10.611
Great! Hey, just right. Exactly!

42:26.878 --> 42:29.713
As a child I loved to climb everywhere.

42:29.839 --> 42:33.800
Ill let the psychiatrist decide why.
Maybe I wanted to escape my time.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.762
Maybe I wanted to see the world
from a different perspective

42:36.888 --> 42:38.931
and I was an explorer at heart.

42:39.057 --> 42:42.351
Who knows and who cares,
but I was a little climber,

42:42.477 --> 42:46.855
and nobody, not my parents, not
the teachers, nobody could stop me.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.532
I heard about wirewalkers,

42:57.659 --> 43:02.537
described to me as magnificent
men and women walking in thin air.

43:02.664 --> 43:06.250
And I thought, "Well, thats
nothing. With my ropes, I do that. "

43:30.108 --> 43:35.612
Oh, shit! If only I could control it.
Only a few steps are going to be nice.

43:37.595 --> 43:41.998
There was always and still is, this
'bad boy' side to Philippe's character.

43:42.166 --> 43:45.567
He had a very strict upbringing.

43:45.836 --> 43:49.670
And he would never have strayed
too far down that illegal road.

43:50.308 --> 43:57.805
But he got great pleasure from
taking certain 'liberties'.

43:58.015 --> 44:01.746
He's so excessive, so creative,

44:01.786 --> 44:05.017
...so each day is like
a work of art for him.

44:22.006 --> 44:26.375
What excited him most
about this adventure...

44:26.410 --> 44:29.709
...aside from being a beautiful show...

44:29.747 --> 44:32.648
...was that it was like a bank robbery.

44:32.683 --> 44:34.708
And that pleased him enormously.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.970
Ah, no. Cos its not...

45:14.158 --> 45:17.787
Gradually things began
to get more serious

45:17.828 --> 45:20.422
because a proper plan
had to be worked out.

45:20.464 --> 45:22.796
And then the arguments between
Jean-Louis and Philippe...

45:22.833 --> 45:24.232
...really got started.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.936
Mark said, "If... somebody
opened the door in the stairs

45:31.062 --> 45:35.899
"and see a very serious man, dark,
taking big... this is no good. "

45:36.025 --> 45:40.987
Now listen, now listen. In the stairway,
we can be discovered by anyone,...

45:41.114 --> 45:45.033
...now, so we have to be a combination
of a workman and an office man.

45:45.159 --> 45:49.663
I think this is perfect. This
is perfect. And this is no good.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.952
Ok, so we get through the main
gate, however we decide to do it.

45:52.997 --> 45:58.799
The trick is going to be on the top
floor, coming out of the elevator.

45:58.836 --> 46:00.619
It is better to be
dressed as office workers.

46:00.719 --> 46:02.916
- No! As workers...
- Wait! Let me finish!

46:03.016 --> 46:05.674
It was almost impossible
to imagine them...

46:05.709 --> 46:07.472
...getting into the tower undetected.

46:07.511 --> 46:10.241
They didn't even know how
they were going to get in.

46:10.281 --> 46:12.715
And I think right from the start,

46:12.750 --> 46:14.718
Jean-Louis felt an
enormous responsibility.

46:14.752 --> 46:19.985
And he wouldn't let
Philippe have it his way,...

46:20.024 --> 46:22.857
...perhaps because he felt that
Philippe wasn't being realistic.

46:26.063 --> 46:27.963
No! We're being complete idiots.

46:28.799 --> 46:31.427
Jean-Louis knew I sided with him...

46:32.303 --> 46:35.431
...and Philippe also knew I
was taking Jean-Louis' side.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.920
Since long before Vary,

46:39.046 --> 46:43.175
Annie has been angling for
an invitation to New York,...

46:43.301 --> 46:49.806
...using tenderness, blackmail,
threats, insults and tears.

46:51.225 --> 46:55.145
But I need absolute
detachment, complete freedom.

46:55.271 --> 46:59.733
I must be a castaway on a
desert island of my dreams.

47:03.968 --> 47:06.402
May 13th 1974

47:08.409 --> 47:11.620
Philippe and I travelled
to New York together.

47:11.746 --> 47:14.915
I remember looking out through
this hazy aeroplane window

47:15.041 --> 47:17.626
...and seeing in the far
distance the Twin Towers.

47:18.669 --> 47:24.799
Wed come all of this way, and
this was what we were here for.

47:24.926 --> 47:30.388
Metropolis, Frances number
one journal of urban planning.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.392
We are preparing a feature
profile of the workers...

47:34.519 --> 47:38.563
...who are presently constructing
the World Trade Center in New York.

47:38.689 --> 47:45.278
Our credentialed reporter, Philippe Petit, kindly
requests your co-operation for this article.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.199
He told me he was a French journalist,

47:49.325 --> 47:52.911
and it was just not
normal for me to say,

47:53.037 --> 47:55.664
"Show me your
credentials, if you would?"

47:55.790 --> 47:59.501
He was gonna write a story about the World
Trade Center for the French newspapers

47:59.627 --> 48:04.548
and he had two photographers with him, and
I thought that was pretty good publicity.

48:04.674 --> 48:07.008
Do you completely trust
the building yourself?

48:07.134 --> 48:12.264
Is it safe up there? You mean,
tumbling down? No, its safe!

48:12.390 --> 48:15.642
Here was this sort of
long-haired Australian

48:15.768 --> 48:19.646
and this very volatile Frenchman,
who couldnt speak great English,

48:19.772 --> 48:21.773
saying we were journalists,

48:21.899 --> 48:26.027
and we enlisted Jim Moore
and he was the cameraman.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.823
It was, er... it was interesting,
because, er... you know

48:29.949 --> 48:33.785
Here we are, disguising
ourselves as someone who were not

48:33.911 --> 48:36.329
and perfectly getting away
with it, and it was wonderful.

48:36.455 --> 48:39.040
When you are working
and the weather changes,

48:39.166 --> 48:41.001
you stop because you
cannot work any more?

48:41.127 --> 48:44.838
We start doing a day up here and
suddenly the weather gets bad?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.881
We have to finish the day.

48:47.008 --> 48:50.885
So you work on the top
in very bad conditions...

48:51.012 --> 48:53.763
- And you get a bit scared of that?
- No, not really.

48:53.889 --> 48:57.309
I remember Jim would act like he
was taking a photograph of a worker,

48:57.435 --> 49:01.271
then hed put the camera down
and take a photograph of a pylon

49:01.397 --> 49:04.274
or an anchor point or
something like that.

49:06.068 --> 49:09.654
The towers were not
corners facing corners.

49:09.780 --> 49:14.951
They were askew, which was a problem
for me to decide where to put my wire.

49:15.077 --> 49:18.913
So in principle, thats a
cable across the two roofs.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.627
I decided to attach the cable to
what I believe was the strongest beam

49:23.753 --> 49:25.754
at the top of the roof,

49:25.880 --> 49:31.843
and then Im going to tie the
wire to here, on the South Tower.

49:31.969 --> 49:36.264
A cable between two buildings
of very long length, it sways.

49:36.390 --> 49:37.891
It goes up and down,

49:38.017 --> 49:43.063
and there is almost an invisible
move which is a torsion on itself.

49:43.189 --> 49:49.694
So, what we devised is a... its called
a cavaletti in the circus parlance.

49:49.820 --> 49:54.866
Its actually a guy-line that is
perpendicular to the axis of the wire

49:54.992 --> 49:57.077
and it goes down to the ground.

49:57.203 --> 50:00.080
Even with permission, we couldnt go
a quarter of a mile to the ground.

50:00.206 --> 50:04.376
Plus I needed a pair.
Heres one and heres two.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.252
We know they cannot go down.

50:06.379 --> 50:10.590
So the solution was asymmetric rigging.

50:10.716 --> 50:14.010
Which is like this. Heres
the first attachment.

50:14.136 --> 50:17.931
Each cavaletti had two legs,
a short one and a long one.

50:18.057 --> 50:23.269
So, this is what I decided
was the best for the situation.

50:24.814 --> 50:27.066
And now I am preparing for le coup

50:27.105 --> 50:28.157
May 28th 1974

50:28.192 --> 50:30.193
We are going to do it.

50:31.153 --> 50:34.155
I arrived Saturday and
the coup was due on Monday.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.909
He is more and more ready for the coup,

50:38.035 --> 50:40.036
but the coup itself is not ready.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.247
And I was very frustrated about that.

50:43.874 --> 50:47.377
I knew we had to act quickly
and I knew we had nothing.

50:47.503 --> 50:51.172
Jean-Louis wants to know. "Have
you done what I asked you to do?

50:51.298 --> 50:55.677
"What do I say when the guard...?"
And I dont satisfy him with my answer.

50:55.803 --> 50:57.887
So he attacks my non-preparations,

50:58.013 --> 51:00.890
when actually I feel that
I have prepared immensely.

51:02.184 --> 51:06.688
I think the longer we were there,
the longer I was cognisant that...

51:08.274 --> 51:11.276
...it was a very ambitious
pursuit, what we were doing.

51:12.862 --> 51:14.654
We just werent ready.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.866
...more suede, we must put the screw...

51:17.992 --> 51:21.911
I never doubted Philippes
talent, his prowess on the wire.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.748
Itwas the unforeseen things
that really worried me.

51:24.874 --> 51:26.374
...if I need the cavalettis or not...

51:26.500 --> 51:29.836
You know, Americas a
very litigious society.

51:29.962 --> 51:33.047
You know, involuntary
manslaughter, assisted suicide.

51:33.174 --> 51:35.175
...a little bit. Then
we put everything down.

51:35.301 --> 51:38.261
I didnt want to be liable
for the death of a friend.

51:41.182 --> 51:44.184
We could clearly see
that we were not ready.

51:44.310 --> 51:48.313
Everybody could see it but
Philippe, and at the time I gave up.

51:50.316 --> 51:53.234
Obviously, with the
Australian not there,

51:53.360 --> 51:57.280
obviously the whole thing
is a total dΓ©bΓΆcle.

52:00.117 --> 52:03.828
I told him, "Philippe,
what do you think now

52:03.954 --> 52:08.208
"Its May 30th, were supposed
to go to do the coup today.

52:08.334 --> 52:10.210
"Do you think we can do it like that?"

52:10.336 --> 52:12.253
And he said no.

52:13.172 --> 52:16.049
He said, "No, its clear
that its impossible. "

52:16.175 --> 52:20.512
I said, "No, its not impossible. It
is possible, we are very close to it. "

52:22.223 --> 52:24.557
If you want something,
nothing is impossible.

52:24.683 --> 52:29.062
He kept repeating, "Ill be back.
Well prepare it and well do it. "

52:30.093 --> 52:32.357
The first attempt had failed.

52:32.729 --> 52:35.721
He called me and asked me
to come over immediately.

52:35.766 --> 52:40.703
Of course my role was to
support and encourage him.

52:47.878 --> 52:50.847
It was always a matter
of trying to understand

52:50.881 --> 52:53.179
what was going on in his
head and of encouraging him.

52:53.717 --> 52:56.208
That was my job and it
was really exhausting.

53:01.024 --> 53:04.721
He would spend the night
watching television.

53:04.761 --> 53:08.720
He only ever watched detective
movies, bank robberies,

53:08.765 --> 53:11.859
stories about cops and robbers.

53:13.036 --> 53:16.403
I'm convinced he was
getting in shape with this.

53:18.509 --> 53:21.808
He was looking for the strength,...

53:21.845 --> 53:24.507
...so he could break into these towers.

53:25.916 --> 53:28.783
So he went back, again and again,...

53:28.819 --> 53:31.913
...to the World Trade Center,
to the main entrance hall.

53:31.955 --> 53:33.923
And Philippe observed very carefully...

53:33.957 --> 53:40.055
...how people went in,
showing their passes, etc.

53:42.136 --> 53:45.138
I saw him in the lobby.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.557
It was just somebody that
didnt belong there,...

53:47.683 --> 53:51.936
...like someone who had come out...
It was just... it was just er...

53:52.062 --> 53:54.981
...a wrong juxtaposition.
It just was very, very odd.

53:55.107 --> 53:59.235
"Philippe, its wonderful to see you. "

53:59.361 --> 54:04.115
And his name is Barry. He has
seen me street-juggling in Paris.

54:06.535 --> 54:11.748
He started talking and telling me
all this wirewalking that he did.

54:11.874 --> 54:16.878
I think I said at some point, "If youre thinking
of doing the World Trade Center, forget it. "

54:17.004 --> 54:20.924
But he sort of draws
you in to his world.

54:21.050 --> 54:26.262
And I guess I was the kind of guy who was not
averse to doing things that were slightly er...

54:28.223 --> 54:30.224
...you know not... not totally legal.

54:32.561 --> 54:34.604
Barry called and said,
"Philippe, sorry to tell you,

54:34.730 --> 54:38.483
"but the security around the
World Trade Center has changed,

54:38.609 --> 54:41.694
"and now we all are
forced to carry an ID.

54:41.820 --> 54:45.782
"But I happen to have mine
freshly unsealed from the envelope.

54:45.908 --> 54:49.327
"It wont be too much trouble to abandon
it in your hands for a few hours. "

54:49.453 --> 54:54.499
He did this incredibly artistic,
perfect job of copying it

54:54.625 --> 54:57.835
and getting an ID card
with his own picture on it.

55:00.410 --> 55:04.346
David aka "Donald" Rock Singer

55:06.053 --> 55:10.974
One day he called me and said, "Ive
found two or three American guys.

55:11.100 --> 55:15.812
"They are crazy, they are great
and they are ready to help. "

55:15.938 --> 55:20.900
I meet two American young
men, Donald and Chester.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.988
We met with Petit and I had
a friend named Alan Welner

55:25.114 --> 55:27.073
who I went to high school with.

55:27.199 --> 55:29.409
He was always up for
an adventure. Always.

55:29.535 --> 55:33.037
I think Petit knew also that
this guy was a quality guy.

55:33.543 --> 55:34.501
Alan aka "Albert" Quality Guy

55:34.623 --> 55:40.128
Certainly smart. Certainly aware
of himself and knowing his limits.

55:40.254 --> 55:42.547
The ideal accomplice.

55:42.673 --> 55:45.758
He was pitching it.
He was presenting it.

55:45.884 --> 55:49.721
He was desperately sort of proposing it

55:49.847 --> 55:54.767
in a way that you would, you know,
sell a time share or something.

55:54.893 --> 56:00.231
I knew he was a nut or a con man or
something, but he seemed harmless enough.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.319
I didnt really take it
seriously at that point.

56:07.197 --> 56:10.199
I need to practise a
little bit on the wire,

56:10.325 --> 56:13.911
and I need mostly to show my
two, three American friends

56:14.038 --> 56:19.500
how to hook the cable,
how to help Jean-Louis.

56:19.626 --> 56:22.420
Thats when I saw him on a cable.

56:23.338 --> 56:26.007
I had never seen
concentration like that.

56:26.133 --> 56:28.551
And I think I never have to this day.

56:28.677 --> 56:33.556
And his face became this...
ageless mask of concentration.

56:33.682 --> 56:37.351
I mean, he became like
a sphinx. It was amazing.

56:51.658 --> 56:54.994
He did it beautifully and calmly.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.247
He just did it in fact,
literally with his eyes closed.

56:58.373 --> 57:02.418
Itwas just what he does.
Everything he told me was true.

57:16.780 --> 57:19.681
I was really very worried.

57:19.716 --> 57:24.085
The team included people
who were totally unreliable.

57:32.241 --> 57:35.576
I dont remember right now
when we fixed the date,

57:35.702 --> 57:38.412
but we had fixed the
date for August 7th.

57:40.470 --> 57:42.665
Jean-Louis reminded
me about Notre Dame,

57:42.706 --> 57:44.640
said it would be the same kind of thing,

57:44.674 --> 57:48.474
the same adventure, but this time in
New York at the World Trade Center.

57:49.045 --> 57:51.036
He didn't tell me much more,

57:51.081 --> 57:53.174
just asked whether I
wanted to come or not.

57:53.470 --> 57:57.014
Jean-Louis arrives and I go
and pick him up at the airport.

57:57.141 --> 57:59.600
Hes with Jean-FranΓ§ois,
whom of course I remember.

57:59.726 --> 58:02.728
Hes an adorable, little
apparition and hes all smiles.

58:02.855 --> 58:07.233
He doesnt have any questions. He
will just follow. Hes here to help.

58:08.098 --> 58:11.864
When we arrived in New
York on the Boston train,

58:11.902 --> 58:14.803
at one point we went past
the Empire State Building.

58:15.238 --> 58:18.401
At that moment I looked up,

58:18.441 --> 58:20.875
I saw the height of the
Empire State Building

58:20.911 --> 58:23.141
and I was horrified.

58:23.180 --> 58:26.638
My legs started to
shake, it was terrifying!

58:27.317 --> 58:29.581
Especially when I realised the
World Trade Center was even higher.

58:29.619 --> 58:33.350
I kept it all to myself,
but I was terrified.

58:39.016 --> 58:43.269
β™

58:43.896 --> 58:46.856
β™

58:49.306 --> 58:53.037
When Jean-Louis came back,
the tension rose enormously.

58:53.076 --> 58:55.670
It became unbearable.

58:55.712 --> 58:57.873
The problem was the team.

58:59.912 --> 59:02.747
β™

59:04.541 --> 59:07.376
I met the first two guys.

59:07.502 --> 59:13.299
One of them was a musician, the
other one, I think, was a carpenter.

59:14.801 --> 59:18.846
They really looked liked
losers. I mean, Im sorry but...

59:21.767 --> 59:24.518
When I saw these guys,
I thought, "Oh, my God!"

59:28.678 --> 59:34.446
The very night before the coup,
they arrived at the apartment

59:34.484 --> 59:37.317
in a deplorable state.

59:37.354 --> 59:39.083
One of them was stoned.

59:39.122 --> 59:43.582
He was completely gone,
lost in a haze of smoke.

59:43.627 --> 59:47.996
Jean-Louis was absolutely
dismayed. So was Philippe.

59:48.335 --> 59:51.504
It was likely I probably
had been smoking pot.

59:51.630 --> 59:54.548
Yeah, likely as all hell.

59:55.425 --> 59:58.094
I smoked pot every day for 35 years.

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.222
Theres no reason to think
I didnt smoke that day.

01:00:03.976 --> 01:00:07.436
When Jean-Louis meets Albert,
he has a little intuition,

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.399
I can read it in Jean-Louis
face. He doesnt trust Albert.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.527
You know you have this
feeling with people.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:18.823
Sometimes its wrong, but
you cant help it anyway.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.536
We shook hands, said hello.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:26.622
They didnt speak English,
I spoke no French.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.458
So, there wasnt too much to say.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:35.089
Just, "Nice to meet you, good
luck, lets do what we have to do. "

01:00:38.949 --> 01:00:42.385
11.08pm, August 6th

01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.323
When I felt that the whole
floor finally was silent

01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:03.826
and the darkness was
there, I ventured out.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:10.291
Imagine staying three hours on a beam,
you cannot walk. You need re-education.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:15.629
A normal human being staying completely
unmoving on a beam for three hours cannot walk.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:26.390
After a while I said, "We
cannot wait any more. "

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.893
I told Albert, "You
know what? You should go,

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.439
"because if I go, if Im caught,
there is no way we can do the rigging.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:38.444
"Im the only one who knows about
Philippes habit and how to do it. "

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:45.910
So he goes on the top and
comes back five minutes later.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:50.039
Im sure I just said, "OK, lets
go. Lets just get this done".

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:55.669
So he said, "Great, we dont know what
this noise comes from, but lets go. "

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:59.715
And now we moved and we go for
the most important equipment.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.677
I mean a wirewalker
needs a cable to walk on.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:08.974
Now we are walking toward a tiny little
construction staircase, very narrow,

01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:11.268
and hes in front and I am in the back.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:14.688
I see a nightmare: a policeman.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:17.605
And the policeman has his eyes
open and hes looking at me!

01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:19.581
There was someone there
that we hadn't expected,

01:02:19.616 --> 01:02:22.585
sitting at a desk with a little light.

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:28.119
I decide to hold him. But
hold on, he is pushing me.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.580
The same way I am holding him,
the same way he is pushing me.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:33.207
What is happening?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.252
There is no way I can get
Jean-FranΓ§ois to turn around.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.712
So, lets play his game. Lets follow.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.594
We were very silent, because
we didnt have shoes on.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.597
When we arrived on the top, I
whispered, "Did you see the guard?"

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.184
He said, "Of course I saw the guard, and
I was trying to alert you by pushing you.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.103
"But why did you resist?"

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:57.857
I said, "I was trying to resist, to have
you turn around and for me to explain... "

01:02:59.522 --> 01:03:03.925
I remember the vastness
of New York! The altitude!

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:10.923
The Statue of Liberty, the UN
building, all looking so tiny.

01:03:11.134 --> 01:03:13.193
It was magnificent.

01:03:13.236 --> 01:03:16.296
And the sounds as well, the
police sirens all night long.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.965
It was all so alive!

01:03:19.008 --> 01:03:20.566
And we were kings!

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.633
The most beautiful moment
is when I see a shape,...

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.344
...actually, two silhouettes
on the other tower.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.763
I recognise immediately in the darkness,

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:33.392
it is the silhouette of Jean-Louis and
the silhouette of Albert. They made it!

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:37.730
When I saw them on the
roof, I was so happy.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:41.108
And the impression I got, I
remember that all the time,

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:45.779
you go on the roof, its all dark and there
is this red light for the planes, you know,

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:49.909
thats turning, and thats
like a... like a metronome,

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:54.079
giving you an idea of time going by.

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:58.083
There was peace and
immensity, and I... I...

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:02.046
In the middle of all this madness,
I suddenly had hope and joy.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:26.111
So I put, like a bat, actually...

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:29.740
I put Jean-FranΓ§ois, upside down
in that little staircase opening.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.742
Just his head showing.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.204
So imagine what the guard must
have seen if he were awake.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:39.041
He would have seen a human beings
head, looking at him upside down!

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.970
First thing I did, I prepared my bow.

01:04:58.103 --> 01:05:04.692
Prepare the arrow and prepare the
fishing line and wait for them.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:16.954
So, there was this signal for Jean-Louis
to say, "I am ready to shoot. "

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.417
And there was a signal for me to
say, "I saw your signal. I am ready. "

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:25.504
And Im going to count till
ten and then he will shoot.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.757
But there were no signal
for "I am not ready".

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:31.468
I hadnt thought of that
and I was not ready.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:37.308
- Finally, they... they give the big signal.
- "I am ready. "

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:42.938
I have been waiting for so long, that
when he finally... gives a signal,

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:48.819
instinctively, I took the...
the bow, I aim and I aim at him.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.656
And he was almost at the edge
of the... of the building.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:59.121
I go hunting for the arrow.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:00.706
Nothing!

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.293
Out of frustration, I
take all my clothes off,

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:09.632
and I think that, the line, I will
feel... the line on my naked... skin.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.431
With a defeated heart,
I climb down to the edge,

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:22.061
and I feel a dancing fishing
line caressing my thigh.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:28.525
The arrow was actually
balancing... precariously

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:32.279
on the very edge of
the buildings corner.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:37.326
A little... ... a little
blow, and it was breezy,

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.453
would have simply made it fall.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.334
The first thing we did
after a few ordinaires,

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.253
a few little ropes getting
bigger and bigger and stronger,

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.631
was to bring a burlap bag.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:59.640
And this bag was carrying the very important
item of the communication, the interphone.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:03.519
A little tinny toy
intercom is connected.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.398
And we hear Philippes
voice on the other end.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.566
And that was an important moment.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.570
Now the four of us are together,
the work is truly going to begin.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.366
The guard leaves,
Jean-FranΓ§ois hardly can talk,

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.451
his head has been
upside down for so long.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.579
But we go back, we
rush, we get our shoes.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.165
And now we bring the
equipment like mad people,

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.335
and I put a little
trap in the staircase.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:35.217
And that will be like an alarm clock,
"Ah, somebodys getting on your roof. "

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:39.471
By that time, everything was perfect.
I mean, it was not even midnight.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.932
Itwas... normal rigging,

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:48.897
that means within three hours
everything wouldve been perfect.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.526
Now we are ready to pull the
wire. Philippe has a wire ready.

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:57.030
The nylon rope is... in
our hand. We are ready.

01:07:57.157 --> 01:08:02.244
At some point, I gave
probably too much cable.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:08.041
And all of a sudden, I see the
wire going... a tremendous noise.

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:10.252
I thought, "My God, whats going on?"

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.172
We almost lost the wire.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.635
So I called Philippe, "Whats going on?"
He said, "Yeah, we could not hold it. "

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:22.765
Which was... very unfortunate.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.144
The fact that I didnt speak French,

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:33.317
so I couldnt hear the details of what was
going wrong, was probably just as well.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.781
So we had to pull... er...

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:43.285
probably more than 100
metres of wire plus rope.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:47.122
I dont remember how much
we gained with each attempt.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:51.084
Maybe we worked hard for one minute,
two minutes, three minutes, four minutes,

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:55.046
and got a tiny bit of this
endless cable up there.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:59.259
Within, I dont know, half an
hour it became almost impossible.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.096
Here we are in big trouble.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.684
Somebody is coming on the roof.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.526
Jean-FranΓ§ois hears also,
and he hides immediately.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.694
And I see him, hes like a dead animal.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.615
As a child, have you ever
played hide-and-seek in a park

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:25.702
and taken refuge behind
a giant tree trunk?

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.537
And a policeman comes to the roof.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.750
And then your companion comes.
Circles the trunk, he walks, you walk.

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:33.417
He stops, you stop.

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:37.005
The man starts turning around this
obstacle in the centre of my tower,

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.716
and I turn around on the
side diametrically opposed.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.426
This little pas de deux
could go on forever,

01:09:42.554 --> 01:09:45.471
until one of you turn around
and bump into each other.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.390
Well, this is exactly what happened.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:51.353
He turns, I turn. He stops,
I stop. He goes on, I go on.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.481
Now, of course, if he would
have turned around, oops!

01:10:03.045 --> 01:10:07.311
4.48am, August 7th

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:16.211
Albert was starting to...
to give up, to argue,

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:21.174
to say, "No, I dont want to do this any more.
Its not possible. We are not going to do it. "

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:25.387
It was clear we werent going to get this
job done, but there was no arguing with him.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:28.932
There was just... you
know It was useless.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:32.477
He was just going to
go ahead, regardless.

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:38.775
Its impossible, impossible that he thought we
were going to be able to rig this before daylight.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:42.613
Imagine being... after
these months of preparation,

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:48.410
these months of all that,
and finally being on the roof,

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:52.122
on the roof and having to stop
because the wire is like that.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.457
I mean... phew!

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.835
At dawn, I assumed, "Well,
the jig is up," you know

01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:01.840
We... we did the best, and now,
you know, lets get outta here.

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:17.208
The streets were deserted.

01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:20.754
I found a taxi willing to take me there.

01:11:22.058 --> 01:11:25.516
So I waited with the others.

01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:28.223
Other members of the team joined us.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.167
And our eyes were absolutely
glued to the towers.

01:11:36.205 --> 01:11:38.673
I was looking out for
the slightest movement,

01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:40.335
but we couldn't see a thing.

01:11:42.878 --> 01:11:45.540
It was absolutely terrifying.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:52.557
Itwas a misty day, and I
thought, "Eegh, that sucks. "

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:57.354
And it wasnt windless either. There
was a little bit of air that morning.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.317
And you could see when the,
erm... when the cable was up there,

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.444
and it looked very, very slack.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.672
I pulled like crazy,
like crazy, like crazy.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.674
Finally, I got the wire.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.221
For some reason, the last metre
was the one that came the easiest.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.892
Despite the abandon of...
of his co-accomplice,

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.687
Jean-Louis has his last
communication almost,

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:43.483
"Philippe, I did it, I did it. Ive got two
clamps. We did it, the cable is anchored!"

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:54.494
All of a sudden we see this black spot
coming down off the top of the towers,...

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.448
...and we didnt know what the hell it
was, like, "Oh, my God, what is that?"

01:12:57.586 --> 01:13:00.783
Suddenly we saw something, a shape,...

01:13:00.823 --> 01:13:02.950
...just for a second, falling down.

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:06.339
I saw this thing falling down,...

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:09.885
...and... I couldnt believe it.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:14.598
And I said to myself, "Thats it, youve
been fooling yourself this whole time.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:19.811
"He went straight down with the first
step off the roof. He might be dead. "

01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:24.606
There was a huge cry of relief...

01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:26.774
...it was only a piece of clothing.

01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:30.217
We all thought: " He must have
just dropped something, that's ok. "

01:13:40.214 --> 01:13:40.214
We all thought: "Of course
it's possible he could fall. "

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:46.379
On the top of... Philippes roof, there
was a big wheel of the... the machines.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:53.261
So as soon as the elevator would move, we
would see the wheel starting to... to turn.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:00.852
I scream, "La roue, la roue!" to
Jean-FranΓ§ois. "The wheel, the wheel!"

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:04.397
Because I see the giant
wheel starting in motion,...

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:09.820
...and I know my fate has been written
now, time is no longer smiling at me.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:18.203
At that time I was really worried. I
think, the first time I was really scared.

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.664
"Oh, my God, hes
exhausted, like I am... "

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:26.670
Maybe not as much, but for what he has
to do... Its really not a good thing.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:31.591
The wire is the worst
wire we ever... did,...

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.553
...and... er... I was really scared.

01:14:41.056 --> 01:14:43.581
We all thought it, but
we didn't believe it.

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:46.017
We thought it, but we didn't believe it.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:55.740
And I had to make a decision

01:14:55.867 --> 01:15:00.328
...of shifting my weight from one
foot anchored to the building...

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.664
...to the foot anchored on the wire.

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:10.255
This is probably... I dont know... probably
the end of my life to step on that wire.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:13.925
And on the other hand, something
that I could not resist...

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:19.014
...and I didnt make any effort to
resist, called me upon that cable.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.686
And death is very close.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:59.721
I start walking as a wirewalker
who is studying his cable.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.808
And instead of doing an entire
study for the whole length,...

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:06.394
...seeing the first
cavalettiand keep walking,...

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.939
...seeing the middle which
is so soft and treacherous,...

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:11.274
...seeing the second
cavaletti how it is...

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.445
No, I do only go to the first
cavaletti and I know enough!

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:21.910
Now Im going to perform.

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:25.789
I saw his face changing.
He was very tense.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:30.085
And all of a sudden there was
something... like a relief in him.

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:35.507
And from that time I thought,
"Thats it. He is secure. Its good.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.425
"And wow, thats... "

01:16:53.055 --> 01:16:54.488
I saw Philippe.

01:16:54.523 --> 01:16:57.219
I saw Philippe up there,
it was extraordinary.

01:16:57.259 --> 01:16:59.625
It was so, so beautiful.

01:17:02.765 --> 01:17:06.326
It was like he was walking on a cloud.

01:17:09.905 --> 01:17:11.031
And there were such amazing moments.

01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:12.131
When he lay down...

01:17:12.174 --> 01:17:18.807
...we were thrilled by this image
of Philippe lying down up above.

01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:29.854
And another very powerful
moment was when he...

01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:35.794
It was so beautiful.

01:17:38.033 --> 01:17:40.399
When he knelt down.

01:17:40.436 --> 01:17:44.873
There was a moment when
he knelt down and saluted.

01:17:52.348 --> 01:17:54.543
I cried out: " Look! Look!"

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:58.519
People started gathering,
but they couldn't see.

01:17:58.554 --> 01:18:00.749
They asked me: "What
is it? What do you see?"

01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:05.192
I said: " Look, a
wirewalker! He's walking!"

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.978
I sat down on the wire
on one crossing,...

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.022
...and I did something
that amazed people.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:20.236
I actually looked all the way down, to look at
something that I will never in my life see again.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.868
So I can tell you, probably
its a lie, but to me its not,

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:32.082
I heard the crowd. I saw the
crowd. I heard them murmur.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.756
Beyond anything you could ever imagine.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.967
Its just... mind-boggling.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.513
The awe of the event...

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:50.934
...and the overwhelming largeness
of the scale of the situation...

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.979
...took my mind into a place where I
really wasnt that concerned about him.

01:18:55.106 --> 01:19:00.652
It just... it was... magical. It
was just... it was just profound.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:24.509
Officer Meyers and I
observed the... er...

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:29.514
...tightrope dancer, because
you couldnt call him a walker,

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.268
approximately halfway
between the two towers.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:37.480
And upon seeing us, he
started to smile and laugh.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.445
They dont know how to react
to a daydreaming wirewalker...

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:47.749
...lying down and dialoguing with
a seagull, so they were really mad.

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:49.991
Philippe did provoke them, naturally,...

01:19:50.032 --> 01:19:54.059
...because that's what he
does, that's his character!

01:19:54.236 --> 01:19:57.330
He would come close to the
guards or the police,...

01:19:57.372 --> 01:19:59.272
...who were trying to grab him,...

01:19:59.308 --> 01:20:03.005
...then he would turn around
and be out of their reach,...

01:20:03.045 --> 01:20:05.878
...because they weren't
about to get on the wire!

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:09.387
When he got to the building, we
asked him to get off the high wire,...

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:13.308
...but instead he turned around
and ran back out into the middle.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:18.188
Everybody was spellbound
in the watching of it.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:21.274
When we observed that he
wasnt about to come in...

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.359
...because he seemed to
be enjoying it so much,...

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:27.280
...we mentioned the fact to his
associate that if he did not come in...

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:30.533
...we would have a helicopter
pluck him up off the wire.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:34.287
At which time his associate...

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:38.458
...spoke to him in French,
being that hes a Frenchman.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.543
"Philippe!" you know

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.255
And he said, "The police are going
to dislodge you and you should stop. "

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:50.094
And I was... I was... I was madly enraged
by that, but also it saved my life.

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:53.181
There is somebody out
there on a tightrope walk...

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:57.560
...between the two towers of the World
Trade Center, right at the tippy-top!

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:01.606
I personally figured I
was watching something

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:05.610
that somebody else would
never see again in the world.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:08.696
I thought it was once in a lifetime.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:20.959
I had no reason to stay on that wire
any more, and also I felt... huh!...

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:22.585
...humidity in the air
and the wind growing.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:25.630
My friends later told me,

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:30.176
"You spent 45 minutes. You
know you did eight crossings?"

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.557
They grabbed me and they grounded me,...

01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:39.435
...handcuffed... actually hands in the
back, I was thrown down the staircase,...

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.271
...the most dangerous part
of this whole adventure.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:46.234
I almost broke my head on a narrow
staircase that led to the elevator.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.239
We got it from the Port Authority that
they took about three days to rig it up.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:55.076
Id say its about $1000
worth of cable,...

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:57.996
...and the rigging outfit itself,
its magnificent the way he did it.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.831
- Did he say why he was doing it?
- No.

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:04.085
Why did you do it? I will explain...

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.462
You know, "Why? Why?"
And that was a very...

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:10.300
...again in my way of seeing America,
a very American finger-snapping question.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:15.096
I did something magnificent and
mysterious, and I got a practical "why".

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:18.474
And the beauty of it is
that I didnt have any why.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:22.437
- Why did you do this?
- Thats the thousandth "why" this morning.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.230
There is no why.

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:33.364
I was then taken for a psychiatric
examination by a psychiatrist.

01:22:37.232 --> 01:22:39.860
The place was a sort
of scientific area...

01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:41.892
...where lunatics walk round in circles.

01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:47.837
So here we were,
surrounded by mad people.

01:22:48.076 --> 01:22:50.567
But we weren't mad, we were stars!

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:54.135
I kept asking for water,
because I was so dehydrated.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:56.304
He said, "When was the
last time you drank?"

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.349
I said, "Are you crazy Youre
mad! Do you know what I did?

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.727
"I danced at the top of the world! I
am on the front pages of all the world!

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:06.481
"300 journalists are waiting to talk to me,
and you ask when was the last time I drank?

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.149
"You're completely mad!"

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:11.444
So he wrote, "The guy is completely
normal. Hes just very thirsty. "

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:17.116
Police took a humourless view of the act.
They took Petit and a companion into custody.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:21.245
They finally decided to charge them with
trespassing and disorderly conduct...

01:23:21.372 --> 01:23:24.540
The District Attorney offered me a deal.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:28.169
He said, "Philippe, if you
agree to do a little show,

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:30.546
"like juggling three
oranges in front of four kids

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:36.302
"but on camera for the news and all
that, then well drop all the charges. "

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.304
So I said, "Sure. "

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:53.486
And now I climbed down the
steps of the Palais de Justice.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:57.573
I saw in the crowd an admirer,
she was smiling beautifully.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.537
She came to me and she put her
hands on my neck in a loving way,

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:07.583
and she amorously said, "Philippe,
I would like to be the first person

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:12.463
"to... to welcome you
and to celebrate with you.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:15.508
"Lets... lets... I can
follow you anywhere. "

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:23.516
So yes, it did end up on a
waterbed in a loft somewhere,

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:28.646
but I went for a very short
little moment of... of... of...

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:33.151
I dont know!... of pleasure
of the flesh. How disgusting!

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:36.821
But, but, but I am
sorry, how beautiful, too!

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:40.533
I mean, my friends were waiting
for me. Annie, my girlfriend...

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:42.535
It was a betrayal of my friends.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:47.457
I remember, I called and said, "I have many
interviews to do, so Ill see you soon. "

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:52.837
I had this magnificent explosion
of pleasure, lets say it,...

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:56.883
...and then I went back... oh, frightened
to death, you know, to my friends,

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:58.793
thinking Im a really, really guilty guy.

01:24:58.974 --> 01:25:03.741
I saw Philippe discover what
it meant to be famous,...

01:25:03.779 --> 01:25:10.412
...to be recognized, with expressions
of friendliness and enthusiasm.

01:25:10.452 --> 01:25:14.616
People would cross the street to
tell him: "You gave us such a gift!"

01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:16.590
"It was so beautiful!

01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:18.593
It was a breath of
fresh air... thank you!"

01:25:19.494 --> 01:25:23.988
It was extraordinary and I
think in Philippe's mind,...

01:25:24.032 --> 01:25:26.159
...many things were changing.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.917
I am a celebrity in
New York. People say,

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.669
"Are you the guy who walked
between the Twin Towers?"

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:36.631
I say, "Yeah, yeah, its
me. " "This is incredible!"

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:38.674
Then some people say, "Are you the
guy who...?" I say, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.502
Then people say, "Are you the
guy...? I say, "Yeah! Yeah! Its me!"

01:25:40.582 --> 01:25:44.177
So the judge's sentence
was pretty harsh, I thought.

01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:47.985
I was expelled from the United States.

01:25:51.487 --> 01:25:51.487
There was a love story.

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:55.650
We talked about it on the plane.
Jean-FranΓ§ois was so happy.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:26:00.822
He said, "Well, Im ready for the next time.
" I said, "No, there will not be any more...

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:04.700
"... any more stories like that. "

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:09.455
There was something broken,
probably, in this friendship.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.543
It doesnt matter, because...

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:19.340
Well, basically because we did
it. And... er... basically...

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:27.223
I mean, you cannot
take away what happened.

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:28.766
And er...

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.395
Yeah, what happened is that... er...

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.087
But it was clear...

01:26:54.389 --> 01:26:59.122
...that Philippe had gone through
an incredible moment in his life...

01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:03.488
...and he was starting
something else, a new life.

01:27:06.902 --> 01:27:09.735
Strangely, I felt the same way.

01:27:11.806 --> 01:27:15.173
Our relationship was
meant to end here...

01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:17.440
...and it was beautiful that way.

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:01.859
To me, its really... its so simple,...

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:05.905
...that life should be
lived on the edge of life.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.991
You have to exercise rebellion.

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:16.624
To refuse to taper yourself to
rules, to refuse your own success,...

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.876
...to refuse to repeat yourself,...

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:23.965
...to see every day, every year,
every idea as a true challenge,...

01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:27.551
...and then you are going to
live your life on the tightrope.
