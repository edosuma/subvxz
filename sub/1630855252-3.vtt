What?

06:38.990 --> 06:40.550
You were unusually quiet
in the car.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.920
I was singing along
to the Grateful Dead,

and you didn't
make fun of me once.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.890
Please, there's literally
nothing less important

06:47.090 --> 06:48.600

athletic competition.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.010
This kid gets it.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.560

- Yeah.

But intense, yeah.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.230

And, you know, she, sometimes,
she's a little...

07:02.930 --> 07:04.490
- Judgy?
- Dad, stop.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.410
But yeah, judgy.
She's totally judgy.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.570
Wait, judgy how?

07:08.770 --> 07:09.660
Like mom-judgy.

Oh, I want to chime in so badly.

[Charlie] It all comes
from a good place.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.580
She's just
a little overprotective,

07:15.780 --> 07:17.000
and I guess
I want things to go well,

I didn't wait
for you to respond.

07:50.730 --> 07:51.740
I shouldn't have crossed that
boundary without your consent.

I'm sorry.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.910
I'm a hugger, too,

07:55.110 --> 07:56.790
Okay, can we do it again, then?
'Cause I cut mine short.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.040

08:05.410 --> 08:07.840
And I can totally see why
already.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.470
I mean, who knew you could be
so chic under those lab coats.

08:10.670 --> 08:14.600
- [chuckles] I mean, this guy's
like a walking J.Crew catalog.
- [cell phone buzzes]

08:14.800 --> 08:15.930
You know,
you say it as an insult,

08:16.130 --> 08:17.310
but all I hear is a compliment.

08:17.510 --> 08:18.560
[Amanda] Oh, dang it.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.440
Lee's dad just bailed again.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.980
He was supposed
to bring fruit salad.

08:22.180 --> 08:23.610
That's actually
what I brought today.

08:23.810 --> 08:26.150
- Okay, it's official.
- [chuckles]

08:26.350 --> 08:27.860
You are a star. Come here.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.490
We're hugging again.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.120
I'm gonna be hugging you
all day, I think.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.370
I think we're gonna be hugging
all day.

08:32.570 --> 08:33.910
Ooh, you're so tiny.

08:34.110 --> 08:35.450
Little bird bones.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.040
I love it.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.560
Ah, I wish
we could share clothes.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.060
She likes you.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.210
This is gonna be
the wedding of the century.

08:44.410 --> 08:45.670
We're so hyped.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.170
[Chauncey] So,
how I like to start is,

08:47.370 --> 08:48.800
I kind of run through
some classics,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.470
just to get a sense of
what you like.

08:50.670 --> 08:52.720
It's broad strokes,
low presh.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.930
So, I'll click through
pretty quickly,

08:55.130 --> 08:57.060
and you just kind of
give me a gut instinct.

08:57.260 --> 08:58.810
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.230
Ooh. Willamette River Inn.

09:01.430 --> 09:03.360
- Love the water.
- No hotels.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.690
[Chauncy] Portland Rose Room.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.440
Yeah, like a cottagecore vibe.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.860
Oh, my allergies would
destroy me.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.450
The Pearl, very modern.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.950
- Dated the bartender.
- Max? Me, too.

09:13.150 --> 09:14.450
[both] Did not end well.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.240
So that's out. Fear not.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.620
Happens all the time,

09:18.820 --> 09:20.250
and I've got
some useful follow-up questions

09:20.450 --> 09:21.470
that can get us
on the same page.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.170
Like, uh, indoor or outdoor?

09:24.370 --> 09:25.600
- Outdoors is so nice.
- Indoor, obviously.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.340
Henry, our wedding is
in December.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.970
Jorge, our climate is
in collapse.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.430
No worries, no problem.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.510
Why don't we just get a little
more in-depth? Sasha?

09:34.710 --> 09:36.150
Complimentary Xanax?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.370
[doorbell rings]

09:40.370 --> 09:42.390
Hey, thank you so much
for coming.

09:42.590 --> 09:43.660
I'm just gonna get my bag
really quick.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.080
So...

09:52.130 --> 09:53.570
This is your gift.

09:53.770 --> 09:54.950
Oh, wow.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.620
Should I open it now?

09:56.820 --> 09:58.050
Yeah, sure.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.890
[gasps]

10:01.930 --> 10:03.210
Oh, my God.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.460
A custom travel makeup station.

10:05.660 --> 10:07.130
[chuckles] Did you make this?

10:07.330 --> 10:09.300
I mean, yeah.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.680
Uh, I started it
before you and I... you know.

10:12.870 --> 10:14.590
But friends give each other
gifts, right?

10:14.790 --> 10:16.470
- Yeah, right.
- [chuckles]

10:16.670 --> 10:19.910
So, I, uh,
put a mirror in here.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.810
- Stop.
- Thought you might like that.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.980
And, you know, some space
for your brushes and products,

10:25.180 --> 10:27.860
- and stuff like that.
- Santiago.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.190
Is this because
I was always bitching

10:29.390 --> 10:31.070
about not having
a mobile makeup station?

10:31.270 --> 10:32.440
See, I did listen sometimes.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.610
Oh! Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

10:34.810 --> 10:37.200
[gasps] Oh, this is, like,
the best present

10:37.400 --> 10:39.080
I've ever received
in my entire life!

10:39.280 --> 10:40.300
Well, I'm glad you like it.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.910
But we should get going.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.540
We owe it to 15-year-old Lily
to get you on the road.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.250
Okay. [chuckles softly]

10:49.450 --> 10:52.380
[groans] I'm gonna be dreaming
about those scallops for months.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.380
Well, if you're
dreaming about scallops,

10:54.580 --> 10:56.010
- then I'm doing
something wrong.
- No, don't worry.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.300
You're in there.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.010
Who do you think's catching
the scallops?

10:59.210 --> 11:01.560
- Naked.
- Ooh, sounds unsafe.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.020
- But, hey, your dream.
- Mm-hmm.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.390
[Nick laughs]

11:04.590 --> 11:07.560
You know,
I've kind of always wanted to.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.020
Well...

11:09.220 --> 11:11.030
- want no more.
- Oh!

11:11.220 --> 11:13.070
Oh, gosh, so he's fun.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.990
You're talking to
the naked scallop catcher, baby.

11:15.190 --> 11:16.700
- [entry bell chimes]
- Oh, wow. A noble profession.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.450
- Thank you.
- That's right. You're welcome.

11:18.650 --> 11:20.590
- [whistle blows]
- [overlapping cheering]

11:21.220 --> 11:22.620
Yes, Charlie!

11:22.820 --> 11:23.950
Eye of the tiger, baby!

11:24.150 --> 11:25.580
- No mercy!
- [Amanda shouts]

11:25.780 --> 11:26.620
You're doing great, honey!

11:26.820 --> 11:28.420
Just remember to feel the fun!

11:28.620 --> 11:30.540
- Oh, my God.
- Enjoy the wind in your hair.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.760
- He is so corny.
- I mean, truly. Thank you.

11:32.950 --> 11:34.720
- But it's cute.
- Well, it was.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.220
I mean, it's not for me anymore,

11:36.420 --> 11:37.630
but I love that you love it.

11:37.830 --> 11:38.900
[chuckles] I do.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.010
[Amanda gasps]

11:41.210 --> 11:42.890
Get 'em, king!

11:43.090 --> 11:43.930
That's how we do it.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.620
- [exhaling rhythmically]
- [chuckles]

11:47.910 --> 11:50.770
Wow. Okay.

11:50.970 --> 11:51.980
Something we like to do,
you know,

11:52.180 --> 11:53.900
to keep the spirits up.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.240
[laughing] I love it.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.110
That's amazing.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.030
Aw, seriously, Sol.

11:59.230 --> 12:01.370
I am just so grateful that
Charlie has you to look up to.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.450
Thank you.
It's special for me, too,

12:03.650 --> 12:05.290
but parents as supportive
as you two,

12:05.490 --> 12:06.410
that's a big deal.

12:06.610 --> 12:07.460
I wish I had that
when I was Charlie's age.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.710
Oh, my God. Please.

12:08.910 --> 12:10.830
That kid teaches me.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.170
I'm not just proud,
I am incredibly grateful.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.960
I-I feel blessed, you know,

12:16.160 --> 12:19.510
to have this incredible,
queer kid.

12:19.710 --> 12:22.300
Ugh, and an awesome,
amazing, queer,

12:22.500 --> 12:24.430
ex-husband as my co-parent.

12:24.630 --> 12:27.100
What? I'm not queer.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.140
But thank you, Amanda.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.190
I think you're
an awesome co-parent, too.

12:31.390 --> 12:33.270
[Amanda] Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I actually thought...

12:33.470 --> 12:34.780
Doesn't matter what I think,
right?

12:34.970 --> 12:37.190
[chuckles] Like, you know,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.070
every-every day there's like
a new teachable moment for me,

12:39.270 --> 12:41.120
and I'm learning lots of things.

12:41.310 --> 12:42.530
I'm sorry, I apologize.

12:42.730 --> 12:44.930
[sighs]

12:49.010 --> 12:51.000
[singsongy] I have cake!

12:51.200 --> 12:52.330
- Who doesn't like this part?
- [chuckles]

12:52.530 --> 12:54.630
Huh? Okay, now take your time.

12:54.830 --> 12:56.440
Savor each bite.

13:00.730 --> 13:03.280
♪ ♪

13:15.000 --> 13:17.730
Now, on the count of three,
you're both gonna point

13:17.930 --> 13:19.570
- to your favorite. One.
- [Jorge] Okay.

13:19.770 --> 13:22.130
Two. Three.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.240
Fondant, Henry? Oh, God.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.870
Uh, a naked cake?

13:26.070 --> 13:27.910
You get like a third of
the frosting you pay for.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.040
Fondant over my dead body.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.370
How many more times
are you gonna use that threat?

13:31.570 --> 13:33.540
'Cause, as of now,
I can't invite half my family

13:33.740 --> 13:35.750
as the seats are taken
by 20 of your dead bodies.

13:35.950 --> 13:37.050
[Jorge] Good!

13:37.250 --> 13:38.380
You know,
we actually collaborate

with some pretty wonderful
couples' therapists.

- Sasha.
- Purple binder?

13:42.130 --> 13:43.860
- Purple binder.
- Okay.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.030

13:48.720 --> 13:49.850
- Well, she did not look happy.
- [door closes]

13:50.050 --> 13:51.230
[whispers] Is this
a terrible idea?

13:51.430 --> 13:52.640
None of this is real.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.150
Whatever happens,
it's gonna make a great story.

13:54.350 --> 13:55.900
Hi, I'm Zari.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.070
Thanks for your patience.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.280
How can I help you?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.280
- Can we get a reading?
- Sure.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.610
Who wants to go first?

14:01.810 --> 14:04.320
Uh, me, apparently.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.870
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

14:06.070 --> 14:07.910
[Nick sighs]

14:08.110 --> 14:10.450
- Thank you.
- Of course.
- [chuckles]

14:10.650 --> 14:13.040
So, what's your name?

14:13.240 --> 14:15.130
Uh, aren't you gonna consult
your crystal ball

14:15.330 --> 14:16.340
for that little piece of info?

14:16.530 --> 14:17.500
I'm kidding.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.800
I'm sorry.
Uh, it's-it's Nick.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.840
Anything in particular
you want to ask the deck

14:21.040 --> 14:22.170
before the spread?

14:22.370 --> 14:24.640
Uh, uh, sure. Yeah.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.090
How am I doing?

14:26.290 --> 14:27.930
That is my question.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.430
- For the deck of cards.
- Great.

14:30.630 --> 14:31.730
I'm gonna pull three cards
for you, Nick.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.950
- Past, present and future.
- Okay.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.710
Let's start with your past.

14:37.750 --> 14:38.940
Ah.

14:39.140 --> 14:39.980
The card of beginning itself.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.110
[Nick] The Fool?

14:41.310 --> 14:42.400
Judgy.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.490
Okay, it's not necessarily
a bad thing.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.740
Could be speaking
to unformed potential,

14:46.940 --> 14:48.740
living in the present moment
without thinking twice.

14:48.940 --> 14:52.000
- Stuff like that.
- Yeah, that does describe me
up until my early 20s.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.660
And my late 20s.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.920
And really any time
up until last month. [chuckles]

14:56.120 --> 14:57.600
Okay, your present.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.500
The King of Cups.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.420
Hmm.

15:02.620 --> 15:06.260
It seems that while you were
once more naïve and fast-paced,

15:06.460 --> 15:08.260
you're now thinking
more seriously

15:08.460 --> 15:10.060
- about matters of the heart.
- Yeah.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.230
Yeah, actually, um, that's
my girlfriend Ana out there.

15:13.420 --> 15:14.770
Things are getting
pretty serious.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.600
Oh, but see,
the card is reversed.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.310
Is it possible there's
some big emotion

15:19.510 --> 15:21.150
you're not letting
yourself feel?

15:21.350 --> 15:25.150
Is there anyone
or anything in particular

15:25.350 --> 15:27.450
you've been avoiding
thinking about?

15:27.650 --> 15:31.290
What, you mean, mean like
an old crush or-or something?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.830
Uh, no.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.540
No, nothing, nothing like that.

15:35.740 --> 15:37.710
Okay, let's take a look
at the future, then.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.290
You know, sometimes
the last card is the piece

15:39.490 --> 15:40.920
that really makes
the whole puzzle fit.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.480
[softly] Yeah.

15:44.020 --> 15:48.180
Oh. Oh, Nick, this is
a beautiful omen of happiness

15:48.380 --> 15:51.510
and deep true love.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.350
But you're gonna have to deal
with whatever the King of Cups

15:53.550 --> 15:55.490
is saying
you're leaving unattended.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.060
Interesting.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.940
All three of these illustrations

16:01.140 --> 16:03.360
prominently feature
different flowers,

16:03.560 --> 16:04.820
and that's not a common symbol.

16:05.020 --> 16:08.090
Do flowers mean anything special
to you, Nick?

16:09.630 --> 16:11.580
Are those...

16:11.770 --> 16:13.300
lilies?

16:14.300 --> 16:16.080
[tires screeching]

16:16.280 --> 16:18.170
[Santiago exclaiming]

16:18.360 --> 16:21.250
- Okay, Lil, you got to...
- Do not say the grapes
and the tuna thing again!

16:21.450 --> 16:23.170
It's clearly not working.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.550
Also, it's a little distracting.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.170
Because it's a gross
food combination.

16:27.370 --> 16:28.430
- [laughing]
- Okay.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.760

27:49.350 --> 27:50.480
