02:03.723 --> 02:06.283
- Looks like an all nighter.
- Yeah, make that an all weeker, bro.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.824
How you doing?
How was Palm Springs?

02:07.994 --> 02:09.426
Excellent. Excellent.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.893
Hey, can you sport this for me?

02:11.064 --> 02:13.294
Oh, yeah, that's good, Steve.
Brain food, huh?

02:13.466 --> 02:16.128
Hey, I'm gonna need this.
This is a good sugar boost for me.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.998
I have my first intramural volleyball
game against the Deltas later.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.970
A game, right at the beginning
of finals? Whose great idea was that?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.336
Hey, I don't make the schedule.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.535
Oh, yeah, well, I guess
with the KEG super cram,

02:25.712 --> 02:28.078
you're not gonna be fazed
by it anyway, are you?

02:28.248 --> 02:29.408
Well, I wouldn't say that.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.642
Since I got back from winter vacation,
things at the house have been chilly.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.515
Are you kidding me?
After we got your charges dropped,

02:35.688 --> 02:38.213
I thought they'd be erecting
a beer-can statue in your honor.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.452
Not quite.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.994
I think some of the brothers
may feel I ratted to get off.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.324
Does Mike Ryan think that?

02:45.632 --> 02:48.260
No, Ryan doesn't think that.
But Sears has a lot of friends.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.197
If you think Sears
is the one who set you up,

02:50.370 --> 02:51.997
I say you blow the whistle on him.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.473
My dad said not to make waves.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.006
Yeah, maybe he's right.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.112
After your brothers see what a great
spiker you are on the volleyball court,

03:00.547 --> 03:02.515
I'm sure you'll be
their golden boy again.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.116
Well, I hope so.
You wanna come to the game?

03:05.652 --> 03:09.383
No, I have to tutor D'Shawn Hardell.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.156
Why are you looking at me like that?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.657
Because in order to get
the charges against you dropped,

03:14.827 --> 03:18.285
I had to promise Randall
I'd help D'Shawn prepare for his finals.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.398
Which is the same thing
you should be doing.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.227
Yeah, I know, but come on.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.132
With all the static at the KEG house,
it's hard for me to concentrate.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.533
Well, you're not the only one.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.334
I saw Silver today, man.
He is freaked.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.443
Why? Because he and Donna
broke up?

03:31.611 --> 03:34.239
No, because they're still sharing
the same apartment.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.709
How can he break up with me
on Christmas?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.911
And all because
I wouldn't sleep with him.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.851
Donna, stop tearing yourself up.

03:44.023 --> 03:47.356
You've made your decision.
Now don't be ashamed to live with it.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.259
<i>Has anybody seen my Cliff Notes?</i>

03:50.430 --> 03:52.227
On the couch.

03:55.602 --> 03:56.864
So how you doing?

03:57.036 --> 04:00.494
Why couldn't Shakespeare write
in normal English like everyone else?

04:00.673 --> 04:02.038
I meant, about us.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.234
Look, I told you already.
After finals, we'll figure it out, all right?

04:05.411 --> 04:08.141
We've both got enough
to worry about right now.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.084
David, if you have a problem,
then it's my problem too.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.089
I've got four finals, two term papers,
and a radio show every night.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.159
Which one of my problems
you wanna start with?

04:21.327 --> 04:23.192
Well, is there anything I can do?

04:23.363 --> 04:25.490
Yeah, you can stay out of my way.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.993
I'll get it. Hello?

04:32.171 --> 04:33.195
Hey, Kel.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.365
No, no, just called to check in,
see if you were studying.

04:36.809 --> 04:37.935
Did you have any doubt?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.806
Never.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.208
Dylan, what's going on there?
Sounds like you're at the Mardi gras.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.816
Oh, well, that is Erica.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.111
I bought her one
of those electric keyboards, you know?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.983
Having a family around,
it's like being at the carnival every day.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.081
Well, they seem nice.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.783
Yeah. Anyway, I just called
to wish you luck.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.156
Thanks. I love you.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.594
All right, you too.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.995
You are a pretty quick learner.

05:06.172 --> 05:08.072
Do you wanna hear it
so it sounds like a trumpet?

05:08.241 --> 05:12.507
Hey, I wasn't born yesterday, okay?
I know a few things about the trumpet.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.271
This is never
gonna sound like a trumpet.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.506
Oh, yeah? Just listen.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.952
That sounds like a trumpet.
It's amazing.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.614
And if you buy another one,
we can jam.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.023
There's a plan, huh?

05:37.203 --> 05:40.730
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking over the classifieds.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.603
The holidays are over, it's time
we stopped being a burden on you.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.834
No, Suzanne. You're no burden.

05:46.779 --> 05:47.803
Well, this will be better.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.972
I'll find a job,
and we'll get a place of our own.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.118
Then you can have a sister
and a life.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.885
Now do you wanna hear it
so it sounds like a flute?

05:56.055 --> 05:57.079
Hey...

05:57.256 --> 06:00.225
Honey, why don't you try
learning another song, okay?

06:00.393 --> 06:02.987
I'd like to play some Aerosmith.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.062
But would you settle
for "Swanee River"?

06:06.232 --> 06:08.291
Rock on, sister.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.767
You know, after the flood,

06:11.938 --> 06:14.338
I never thought
I'd get a second chance.

06:14.507 --> 06:18.739
Well, maybe we're all
getting a second chance.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.386
Well, my Stats final tomorrow.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.252
Wednesday, I have Romantic Poetry,
then Theater History.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.984
And on Thursday, I have English A.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.924
Plus on top of all that,
I still have to work.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.826
Well, talk about killer schedules,
I have three finals in one day.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.695
Andrea, stop being so neurotic.
You could ace them all in your sleep.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.860
I'd feel a whole lot better
if I'd hear from Jesse.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.402
What's going on?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.563
We made an agreement
we wouldn't talk during finals

06:48.741 --> 06:49.765
so I could concentrate.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.672
But I can't concentrate because I keep
wondering why he hasn't called.

06:52.845 --> 06:57.111
- Well, why don't you call him?
- I can't. We made an agreement.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.211
Okay, so maybe I am
just a little neurotic.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.012
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.621
Of course, living on the same floor
with Dan Rubin

07:03.790 --> 07:04.984
hasn't made it any easier.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.291
Andrea, try and remember.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.985
It's better to be the rejector
than the rejectee.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.687
Just ask Donna.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.355
Well, I wish I didn't have
to be either.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.367
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.705
Do you live on the floor?

07:27.980 --> 07:30.642
Yeah. I'm Andrea Zuckerman.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.717
I'm Cathy Fisher,
your new resident advisor.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.215
- What happened to Dan Rubin?
- Beats me.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.857
All I know is that he requested
transfer to another dorm.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.951
I see.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.326
Well, welcome.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.158
Thanks.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.302
Keep it going.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.099
Get it, Keith. Get it, Keith.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.414
Hey, man, you gonna eat
your MoonPie?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.716
Here, Muntz, knock yourself out.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.928
Good try. Come on.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.928
All right, time out.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.504
Forget it, man. We'll get it back.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.641
Let's get set up to return.
Keith, Carlos, you guys are out.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.674
Taylor, Jackson, you guys come in.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.368
Hey, wait a second.
What about me?

08:34.145 --> 08:36.774
What about you? You can use
the pine time to study for your finals.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.883
Put me in, John. This is my sport.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.313
At the Beverly Hills Beach Club,

08:40.486 --> 08:42.544
I've been the captain
of the champion team two years.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.020
You got me sitting on the bench?
What's up with that?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.649
All right. Powell, you're out.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.459
Muntz, you come in.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.628
- So this is how it's gonna be?
- Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.639
Sit down, Sanders.
You'll get your chance.

09:02.808 --> 09:03.832
KEG!

09:04.010 --> 09:05.841
- All right.
- All right.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.819
Figuring out how many points
you're gonna score against USF?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.191
Hey, man, come on in.
I've been expecting you.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.389
You have?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.330
Well, you could've fooled me,
the TV's not on.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.063
- What's the matter, cable out?
- There you go, being your harsh self.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.334
- I'm ready to be tutored, man.
- You're not kidding?

09:37.510 --> 09:40.172
I need something to take my mind off
the San Francisco game.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.712
I'm starting Thursday.
You know what I'm saying?

09:42.882 --> 09:44.816
If you're gonna get
this nervous about every game,

09:44.984 --> 09:46.952
you could probably graduate
in two years.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.179
I'm not fooling.
I'm taking the final tomorrow too.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.550
Man, I'm down with soc.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.352
You're down with soc?

09:53.526 --> 09:54.857
You heard me.

09:55.027 --> 09:58.394
Back home in my 'hood, I witnessed
a sociological system firsthand

09:58.564 --> 10:00.156
and could identify its different strata.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.164
You read chapter five.
I'm impressed.

10:02.501 --> 10:06.164
And chapter six.
Interdependent organizations?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.897
That's nothing but a basketball team.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.265
Was it something
I said turned you around?

10:10.810 --> 10:13.142
No, man. Something D'Tasha said.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.177
D'Tasha, is that the girlfriend?

10:16.349 --> 10:17.907
The twin sister.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.751
She made me study
the whole damn holiday.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.353
She said she'd whip my lazy butt

10:22.521 --> 10:25.354
if I didn't start
getting more out of college.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.220
She works for minimum wage
at a tire plant, you understand?

10:28.394 --> 10:30.658
Yeah, I do. I got a twin sister myself.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.730
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.427
- Come on, man, let's hit it.
- Yeah, man.

10:41.273 --> 10:42.865
Yeah?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.270
- Hey, Bren.
- Hey.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.243
Sorry to interrupt, but I must have just
missed your dad at the office.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.609
Well, he's in the living room,

10:50.783 --> 10:53.377
grumbling over some bills
as we speak.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.043
- Have you studied?
- Yeah, I'm getting there.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.747
You know, these Romantic poets
are driving me crazy.

10:58.924 --> 11:02.792
I don't think I will ever remember
who wrote what to whom and why.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.393
Come over tomorrow.
We'll sort it out.

11:05.731 --> 11:06.823
Well, thank you.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.968
You can spend some time
with Suzanne and Erica.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.572
I gotta tell you, Bren.
She is the cutest kid.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.606
It must be pretty incredible finding out
that you have a family all of a sudden.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.540
I hope your father sees it that way.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.640
Bye.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.111
You wanna do what?

11:23.282 --> 11:24.374
I wanna give them ten grand.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.916
Just enough to help them
get back on their feet.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.886
You know, Dylan, I warned you
about this from the very beginning.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.150
All sorts of scam artists
coming out of the woodwork,

11:33.325 --> 11:34.622
laying claim to your inheritance.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.762
Nobody is laying claim
to anything, Jim.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.191
I'm the one who's offering.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.195
How do you know
they are who they say they are?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.799
Has she shown you any proof?

11:41.967 --> 11:42.991
No.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.636
- Pictures, anything?
- No.

11:44.804 --> 11:48.035
Jim, but look,
you didn't trust my father to begin with,

11:48.207 --> 11:51.643
and he turned out
an awful lot different than you thought.

11:51.811 --> 11:52.835
It's my money.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.707
I know.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.281
And I know how much it means
to you to have a sense of family,

11:58.451 --> 12:01.079
but, Dylan, you gotta be careful.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.383
It's ten grand, Jim.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.555
All right.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.387
How about you give them
5,000 for a start.

12:08.761 --> 12:10.388
With one condition.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.825
What?

12:11.997 --> 12:13.760
She gives you
her Social Security number.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.194
For, like, a tax write-off?

12:17.369 --> 12:20.736
- No, so I can do a background check.
- What am I supposed to say to her?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.739
"Look, here's some money to help you,
but I don't really trust you"?

12:24.043 --> 12:25.874
Blame it on
your cynical business manager.

12:27.012 --> 12:30.243
Hey, if she's legit,
she won't have any problems with it.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.377
<i>The Best
of the David Silver Show?</i>

12:35.554 --> 12:37.283
That's an oxymoron, isn't it?

12:37.456 --> 12:40.948
Like jumbo shrimp
or wireless cable or something.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.891
Come on, Howard. Why can't we just
rebroadcast one of my old shows?

12:44.063 --> 12:45.655
Just so I can get through finals.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.425
Silver, we go live 24 hours a day.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.626
It's a bear, but we love it.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.567
It's just kind of a rough time
right now.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.206
I just broke up with Donna.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.706
Oh, man. That is tough.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.510
I hurt her pretty badly,
but I know it was for the best.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.842
Then let her buck. Cut loose.
Don't mope, do the show.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.610
I'm not looking to mope,
I'm looking to study.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.118
I've got finals in classes
I've hardly been in.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.916
All right, I hear you. Close the door.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.701
Crystal meth.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.837
The drug of choice
for long-distance truckers

13:26.005 --> 13:28.633
and DJ's
who wanna take their finals.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.440
This will do the trick.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.439
I don't know, man. What does it do?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.171
Everything.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.111
Do a hit right now, study.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.650
You'll go through your work
like a chainsaw through butter.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.720
Then you do a bit
right before your 2 a. m. Shift,

13:42.888 --> 13:45.152
you'll be in cruise control
till morning.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.383
Get the OJ out of my fridge.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.763
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Silver.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.516
You didn't happen
to hear my radio show, did you?

14:17.957 --> 14:19.390
No, David, I didn't.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.557
Then you just missed one of the
greatest raps of the 20th century.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.663
You know how everyone's
so uptight about finals?

14:25.831 --> 14:27.822
I just tied it into
the whole health care business,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.764
the environment,
campus parking, nuclear testing,

14:30.936 --> 14:32.426
leaving price tags on gifts.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.335
Everything that makes us
so paranoid.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.634
- Really?
- You know what I think?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.971
I think we were taught to live in fear.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.579
Like, any second,
disaster's gonna strike

14:42.748 --> 14:44.648
and we gotta be ready for it,
but you know what?

14:44.817 --> 14:46.409
You can't.
There's nothing you can do.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.485
If something's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen.

14:48.654 --> 14:53.318
So you just gotta go with the flow
and stop being so scared all the time.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.960
It was all in my show.
You didn't hear it?

14:56.128 --> 14:58.221
No, I'm sorry, I was sleeping.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.331
But I get the drift of it,
and it sounds great.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.662
I gotta tell you,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.565
it's one of the best shows
I've ever done.

15:07.806 --> 15:11.936
David, I don't understand.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.705
I thought you didn't wanna
have anything to do with me.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.144
How can I,
when we're living together?

15:17.316 --> 15:20.410
Well, that's what I was hoping
we could talk about.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.720
I think we need
to decide what we are to each other.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.653
Listen, everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

15:26.825 --> 15:30.192
Don't worry about it.
Do we have any orange juice left?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.422
Oh, hey, Kel, listen,
don't go anywhere, all right?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.625
I wanna tell you
all about the radio show.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.793
What's with Mr. Motor Mouth?

15:38.971 --> 15:41.405
He must have had too much coffee.

15:41.740 --> 15:46.143
You know, Kel,
I think things are gonna work out.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.613
- Hey, bro, did you study?
- Barely. I think I'm flunking life, Bran.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.585
What's the matter?
Did the KEGs lose?

15:57.756 --> 15:59.314
No, the KEGs won.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.823
I got to play two minutes
of garbage time in the last match.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.120
Sears froze me out.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.889
KEG brothers are treating me
like I have the plague or something.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.431
Well, you could always
become an ex-frat slob.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.591
I don't think I'm gonna
give Sears the satisfaction.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.293
So I think I'm gonna
make a few waves.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.400
Gonna tell Ryan
what happened during hazing?

16:14.573 --> 16:15.767
Yeah. I'm gonna name names.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.766
Well, what about
your father's advice?

16:17.943 --> 16:20.969
I never took his advice before,
so why should I start now?

16:21.146 --> 16:23.114
Okay, people,
it's all come down to this.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.443
Let's close the back doors, please.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.482
This final has begun.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.952
- I should have known.
- Known what? What's the matter?

16:34.126 --> 16:36.321
D'Shawn's not here.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.426
You got a pencil?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.695
You're the best.

16:42.868 --> 16:43.994
Sing it, Bren.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.263
<i>Camptown ladies sing this song
Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

16:47.439 --> 16:48.463
Yeah, like that.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.698
<i>Camptown race-track's five miles...</i>

16:49.875 --> 16:51.604
<i>Oh, dah doo dah day, yeah</i>

16:51.777 --> 16:55.577
<i>Gonna run all night
Gonna run all day</i>

16:55.748 --> 16:57.238
<i>Bet my money on a bob-tail nag</i>

16:57.416 --> 16:58.849
- Somebody bet on the bay.
- The bay.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.542
Yeah.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.316
Yeah.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.156
Very good.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.816
If you two are gonna get
any studying done, you better go do it.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.984
Oh, one more time through
and we will have it down.

17:11.163 --> 17:14.394
Yeah, we need some percussion. Grab
a bongo drum, knock yourself out.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.999
Why don't you invite
the neighborhood

17:16.167 --> 17:17.601
and we'll just have
a marching band?

17:17.770 --> 17:20.465
Hey, not a bad idea,
what do you say, sis?

17:22.307 --> 17:24.366
Hey, Suzanne, how did it go?

17:25.477 --> 17:26.501
Oh, I don't know.

17:26.678 --> 17:30.011
There don't seem to be
too many openings for paste-up artists.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.781
Looking for a job
is the worst, isn't it?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.084
I might just have
to go back to waitressing.

17:38.123 --> 17:42.116
Suzanne, could I talk
to you outside a minute?

17:42.294 --> 17:43.852
Five thousand dollars?

17:44.296 --> 17:46.764
I know you've been wanting
to get your own place and, you know,

17:46.932 --> 17:48.729
I figured there'd be
some expenses, so...

17:48.901 --> 17:52.302
Dylan, I don't know,
I really feel funny about this.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.838
Please don't.
It's something I wanna do for you.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.378
Well, as long as you understand
this is just a loan.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.605
As soon as I get a job,
I'm gonna pay you back.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.340
Suzanne, there's one more thing.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.077
And I really hope
that you don't have a problem with it.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.653
I've got to get
your Social Security number.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.485
My Social Security number?

18:14.059 --> 18:15.083
My business manger,

18:15.260 --> 18:18.718
he runs a background check
on everyone that I deal with.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.132
Oh, I see.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.201
I told him he was being overprotective,
you know?

18:24.369 --> 18:26.462
But he says he's looking out
for my best interest.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.162
And obviously, you agree with him.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.001
I didn't say that.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.938
But it is what you meant.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.841
You want
my Social Security number? Fine.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.140
And why don't you take
my fingerprints too?

18:37.316 --> 18:39.648
<i>Call America's Most Wanted.</i>

18:39.818 --> 18:42.252
You are just like your father.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.353
Take your damn check.
I am not for sale.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.753
Suzanne...

18:50.195 --> 18:53.392
Suzanne, hey,
I didn't mean it like that.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.943
David? David, wake up.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.773
What? What's going on?

19:08.947 --> 19:11.438
It's 3:30. Don't you have
your Music Theory final at 4?

19:14.620 --> 19:15.746
Yeah, thanks.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.682
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

19:20.359 --> 19:23.590
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm not feeling so hot myself.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.730
Jackie corralled me
into having dinner with her.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.025
I'm sure I have to sit there
and listen to her rave on

19:28.200 --> 19:29.690
about how the judge
has it in for her.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.327
Oh, that sounds rough.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.233
Hey, knock it off.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.375
You might pull that attitude with
Donna, but you're not gonna with me.

19:37.543 --> 19:38.737
Listen, I'm sorry, okay?

19:38.911 --> 19:41.379
All I'm saying is,
if you don't wanna go, don't go.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.242
What are you getting
on my back for?

19:57.796 --> 20:01.493
- So the test challenged you, I hope.
- Yeah, it did.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.567
Look, I gotta apologize to you.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.600
I don't know
what happened to D'Shawn.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.261
We really spent
a lot of time studying,

20:07.439 --> 20:08.701
and he promised me he'd be here.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.434
Well, it's no problem.
He's up in the Bay area.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.367
Why? The game isn't till tomorrow.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.070
Yeah, but the public-relations director
was besieged with calls,

20:16.248 --> 20:18.648
so he went up there early
to do some national interviews.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.682
You know, CNN, ESPN.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.581
In fact, if we're lucky,
he might mention us.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.221
And the fact
that he's missing finals?

20:24.389 --> 20:27.085
No, he's not missing anything.
I gave him the final as a take-home.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.352
Oh, what are you
gonna give him this time, an A-plus?

20:29.528 --> 20:32.326
Brandon, try to understand
that a successful athletic program

20:32.497 --> 20:34.362
helps to pay
for the education you're receiving.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.626
And the education
he's not receiving.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.532
Is every one of his teachers
as athlete-friendly as you?

20:39.705 --> 20:41.696
- Brandon...
- Well, what if his talent isn't enough?

20:41.873 --> 20:44.205
What if he can't make it in the pros?
Then what does he got?

20:44.376 --> 20:45.809
I'll tell you what he's got.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.071
He's got a minimum wage job
in some Texas tire plant,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.612
because he never got an education.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.648
Look, Brandon, if you decide you want
to take more classes in Sociology,

20:52.818 --> 20:54.649
I suggest you look
for another professor.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.650
Well, at least
we finally agree on something.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.522
So you didn't hear
any of my show last night?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.925
I did like that blast
you did against classic rock radio.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.963
- And you played Zeppelin anyway.
- Thanks, man.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.067
I was in the groove all night.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.725
So how about it?

21:11.903 --> 21:14.371
- Did you get any sleep?
- Oh, excellent Z's.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.439
And my break with Donna
is gonna be a good break

21:16.608 --> 21:18.166
because we both care
about each other.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.038
We worked some stuff out
this morning.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.181
So, what do you say?

21:23.348 --> 21:26.840
- What about your finals?
- I'm on top of it.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.317
Come on, I have a whole bunch
of stuff I have to do tonight

21:29.488 --> 21:32.048
and I just wanna keep
the pedal to the metal.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.920
All right. I have a little bit left.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.528
But listen, next time, you pay.
This stuff's not cheap.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.695
Hey, be cool.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.326
Thanks.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.578
Artie, what's going on, man?
What are you and Mike cooking up?

22:02.754 --> 22:06.053
Hopefully not you.
Watch your back.

22:12.297 --> 22:13.924
I should have known.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.567
What's the matter, wuss Sanders
complaining about playing time?

22:16.735 --> 22:17.929
Like every other freshman.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.038
Guys, relax.
I think Steve has bigger fish to fry.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.572
Whales. I got whales to fry.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.041
Hold on. We're trying to iron things
out, not start a war here, Sanders.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.141
What's going on?

22:29.715 --> 22:31.945
All right, Steve thinks
he was busted in Randall's office

22:32.117 --> 22:34.813
because one of you guys
called the campus cops on him.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.477
Oh, that just proves
besides being clumsy,

22:37.656 --> 22:39.123
Sanders is also paranoid.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.260
Campus security logged
an anonymous phone call that night.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.621
I checked. It's true.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.592
You were Hell Week pledge masters.
Talk to me.

22:45.764 --> 22:46.856
Are you serious?

22:47.032 --> 22:49.057
I'd never do that
to Steve or anyone else.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.428
Keith, maybe you wouldn't...

22:51.603 --> 22:53.366
You're asking for it, Sanders.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.096
You probably
called the cops yourself.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.865
Check this out.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.771
The guy won't even
answer a question.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.879
- He's guilty.
- I'm not guilty, I'm peeved.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.915
That after all I've been through in four
years with this fraternity means squat!

23:06.084 --> 23:07.984
How could you even consider
his word over mine?

23:08.153 --> 23:10.018
John, if you didn't do it, fine, okay?

23:10.188 --> 23:12.122
But if you did,
he's willing to accept an apology.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.689
Doesn't have to go
beyond this room.

23:13.859 --> 23:14.883
Apology?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.051
How can I apologize
for something I didn't do?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.787
- You did it.
- You're a liar, man!

23:18.964 --> 23:20.955
- Hey, man, come on.
- Come on, man.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.328
- Hold up. Hold on, hold on.
- Get off!

23:24.169 --> 23:25.727
I'm claming my right to the test.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.132
- Me too.
- You idiot.

23:27.305 --> 23:30.001
- You don't even know what the test is.
- I don't care.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.803
- As long as it's me against you.
- Well, you got that right.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.639
Because when this goes
before the brothers,

23:34.813 --> 23:36.872
the good news is,
you're out of this fraternity, pal.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.743
We'll see.

24:04.342 --> 24:05.900
David?

24:09.147 --> 24:12.605
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to make sure you were up.

24:13.485 --> 24:14.975
Yeah, well, I'm up.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.086
Well, I heard your show last night.

24:18.256 --> 24:20.816
And I thought that bit about seeing
the children in the playground

24:20.992 --> 24:23.324
being chased by the Grim Reaper,
I thought was really funny.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.923
Well, it wasn't meant to be funny.

24:27.766 --> 24:31.224
Well, I meant, I thought
it said a lot about the human condition.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.667
But it was also a good laugh.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.205
Thanks. I'll see you later.

24:38.343 --> 24:39.640
You know, it was getting so late,

24:39.811 --> 24:43.303
I was beginning to wonder
if you were gonna miss the whole day.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.117
Not that's it's a bad day to sleep in,
if you know what I mean.

24:51.289 --> 24:54.019
Actually, I'm pretty tired myself.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.618
Donna, get off the bed.
Get off the bed.

24:56.795 --> 24:57.887
What? What's wrong?

24:58.296 --> 25:01.356
Listen, if you're so tired,
why don't you go to your own room?

25:02.100 --> 25:05.467
You know, David,
I was just trying to be sweet.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.127
I mean, you said things
would work out.

25:07.305 --> 25:08.704
What do you want from me?

25:08.874 --> 25:09.932
Donna.

25:14.713 --> 25:16.738
Oh, God.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.724
Dylan.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.597
- I thought you guys left.
- No.

25:39.771 --> 25:42.262
Not yet.
Not without apologizing.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.766
I think I'm the one
who ought to be doing that.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.070
No, you've been great.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.213
Yesterday, I really overreacted.

25:49.381 --> 25:53.681
I guess I was feeling sorry for myself
about not finding a job.

25:54.152 --> 25:57.019
I just hate the idea
of being dependent on you.

25:57.188 --> 26:02.285
Listen, I had no business asking you
about your Social Security number.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.020
It only made your problem worse.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.527
Think we can put it all behind us?

26:07.699 --> 26:09.189
Could we?

26:09.367 --> 26:12.097
Only if you take back this check.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.779
Well, we were going
to take the Greyhound to Iowa.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.713
I guess we can fly now. Thank you.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.246
- You're still going?
- Just to tie up some loose ends.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.685
And then we'll come back
and make a fresh start.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.448
Mom, I don't wanna go back.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.650
Honey, we're only
gonna go for a few days.

26:36.628 --> 26:37.754
Can't I stay here with you?

26:37.929 --> 26:42.059
Oh, no, Erica, no. Dylan has too much
to do to be taking care of you.

26:43.735 --> 26:47.102
My last final's tomorrow.
And after that, I got a week off.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.638
- You ever been to Magic Mountain?
- Magic Mountain!

26:53.712 --> 26:55.043
Well, I guess that's settled.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.276
Yeah, Magic Mountain.

27:10.095 --> 27:13.258
David. David.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.432
- What do you want?
- Well, I haven't seen you in a while.

27:17.602 --> 27:20.400
I wanted to say, I was sorry to hear
about you and Donna breaking up.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.630
Man, have you seen Howard?

27:22.073 --> 27:23.700
Howard who?

27:25.910 --> 27:27.434
Never mind.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.870
Yeah, no problem.
What are friends for?

27:30.548 --> 27:32.209
Howard, Howard.
I need your help, man.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.681
You gotta hook me up for tonight.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.650
- I'm tapped, man, cupboard is bare.
- Come on, man, I'm willing to pay.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.482
I got 50 bucks.
Look, I got it right here.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.215
Put that away, man.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.519
Look at you. You look like
something my cat coughed up.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.559
Well, can you help me?

27:44.729 --> 27:47.960
I can make phone calls, but I'm not
gonna get anything till tomorrow night.

27:48.133 --> 27:52.399
- Tomorrow night?
- Oh, boy, you are a mess.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.060
Okay.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.935
- You got any finals today?
- No.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.166
Okay, good. Me neither.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.708
We'll go hang with friends of mine.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.470
Maybe one of them
will have some downers.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.615
- That will take the edge off.
- Thanks, man, you're the best.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.486
Could you get that? It's probably David
and he lost his keys again.

28:16.661 --> 28:17.719
I don't even wanna see him,

28:17.896 --> 28:20.091
no matter how sorry
he says he is about this morning.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.426
Okay, okay.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.228
Where's Silver?

28:27.405 --> 28:29.430
Who knows?
Thank you for the hello.

28:29.607 --> 28:31.939
I'm sorry. How you doing, Kelly?

28:32.110 --> 28:35.273
Fine. Obviously
you're another story, huh?

28:35.447 --> 28:38.678
- What are you looking for David for?
- It's been bugging me all day.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.545
I tried to talk to him
at the Student Union,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.243
but he blew me off like I'm invisible.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.388
Well, at least
he didn't scream at you.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.456
Look, I know we used to be close
at West Beverly.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.455
Now that we're in college,
we've drifted a bit.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.527
A lot of it is just
that you're in a fraternity and he's not.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.295
For the moment.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.059
- Why, what happened?
- Nothing, I gotta go.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.431
No, Steve.
Now you're blowing us off.

28:59.604 --> 29:02.004
We still need each other.

29:02.807 --> 29:04.900
Why don't you stay for dinner?

29:05.643 --> 29:07.372
What are we having?

29:10.048 --> 29:11.572
Hey, kids, did you have fun?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.310
Oh, we had a wonderful time.
It was very romantic.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.886
Oh, he's just excited because
we made the early bird special

29:17.055 --> 29:18.420
and we saved how much, hon?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.354
Thirteen thirty-five,
but who's counting?

29:22.694 --> 29:24.855
Brandon, how can you study
and listen to the radio?

29:25.730 --> 29:30.360
That's not the radio, Dad, that's
a little audio wallpaper I've arranged.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.935
Actually, I was listening
to the CU-San Francisco game.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.033
- How we doing?
- Well, we're up by 12 at the half.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.801
I had no idea CU
had turned into such a powerhouse.

29:38.977 --> 29:42.071
Well, it would appear my good friend,
D'Shawn Hardell, has arrived.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.808
He's already got 23 points,
four rebounds, six assists.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.475
Pure average,
awesome night for him.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.245
Oh, here we go.

29:50.421 --> 29:52.013
<i>All right, the teams are back
on the floor</i>

29:52.190 --> 29:54.249
<i>and if the Dons are gonna
get back in this ballgame,</i>

29:54.425 --> 29:55.449
<i>they gotta solve one...</i>

29:55.627 --> 29:57.390
I guess that's the end
of my romantic evening.

29:57.562 --> 29:58.586
<i>D'Shawn Hardell.</i>

29:58.763 --> 30:01.197
<i>Here's the inbound pass,
the Condors control.</i>

30:01.366 --> 30:02.958
<i>Marsden swings it over to Reed.</i>

30:03.134 --> 30:04.863
<i>He draws a crowd
and spots Hardell.</i>

30:05.036 --> 30:07.004
<i>Backdoor alley-oop for the slam.</i>

30:07.172 --> 30:09.037
- Yes.
- Nice.

30:09.207 --> 30:11.266
<i>Wait a second,
there's a pile up in the paint.</i>

30:11.442 --> 30:13.808
<i>And it looks like the young CU star,
D'Shawn Hardell,</i>

30:13.978 --> 30:16.344
<i>got submarined
coming down from that jam.</i>

30:16.514 --> 30:18.573
<i>And he may be hurt.</i>

30:19.818 --> 30:21.115
<i>The trainer's out there.</i>

30:21.286 --> 30:24.414
<i>And it looks like
he may be calling for the stretcher.</i>

30:24.589 --> 30:26.989
<i>A terrible break
for the electrifying young Hardell.</i>

30:27.158 --> 30:28.887
<i>And boy, you can see it now,
it's his knee.</i>

30:29.060 --> 30:31.028
- Oh, man.
- That's trouble.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.425
Oh, no more.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.024
Thanks for listening
to my problems, guys.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.432
I still think David's
gonna come crawling back, Donna.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.004
Like I'd want him.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.839
So how are you doing?

30:45.009 --> 30:48.035
Dr. Taylor's taking all calls.
What's going on at the KEG house?

30:49.147 --> 30:51.741
Tomorrow night,
we're holding the test.

30:51.916 --> 30:54.009
- Ever hear of it?
- No.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.886
Well, it's a variation
on the blackball ceremony.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.580
It's me against Sears,
and one of us has to be voted out.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.622
And you're afraid it's gonna be you?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.055
How can I compete with this guy?

31:03.228 --> 31:05.662
- He's a big man in the house.
- He's a toad.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.161
Yeah, but he has a lot of friends.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.357
Everyone else will be afraid
to vote against him.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.928
Don't you have one person
that will stand up for you?

31:12.303 --> 31:15.795
Yeah, but the fact remains that this
time tomorrow, I'll be an independent.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.442
I'm sorry.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.804
I just hope it's not unanimous.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.912
I would like to walk
out of there with my head up.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.707
Well, maybe it's for the best.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.713
Hey.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.375
Maybe I could move
into Silver's room.

31:29.153 --> 31:31.178
If you'd have me?

31:31.356 --> 31:33.916
Well, I've already had you.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.994
Kel, if that's David and he's calling
to apologize, tell him I am not here.

31:44.168 --> 31:46.329
I don't care what he says,
I don't care if he's begging,

31:46.504 --> 31:47.937
- I'm not here, please, okay?
- Okay.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.869
Hello.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.702
Hi, Dylan.

31:53.811 --> 31:56.143
That's very sweet.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.576
Who am I kidding?

31:57.749 --> 32:00.013
He's not calling.
He's not coming back.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.049
He just doesn't care.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.445
Donna...

32:15.867 --> 32:17.425
Come on, Donna.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.297
Come on.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.075
So which essay topic did you do?

32:28.246 --> 32:30.111
The alienation theme in Faulkner.

32:30.715 --> 32:31.943
I should have chosen that one.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.050
I'm feeling pretty alienated
myself lately.

32:34.218 --> 32:35.742
Donna,
you're gonna get through it.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.447
Yeah, well, thanks for letting me
use your room to study.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.184
I just didn't wanna go back
to the apartment,

32:42.360 --> 32:43.850
in case he's there.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.325
I'm glad I could be here for you.

32:45.496 --> 32:46.520
- Thanks.
- Come on.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.995
Okay.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.868
I must have left the door unlocked.

33:00.144 --> 33:04.012
Jesse, oh, I missed you so much.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.008
Who let you in here, huh?

33:06.184 --> 33:08.948
I'm gonna be a lawyer, right?
Well, the one thing I can do is talk.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.451
Your new resident advisor
is a big, big improvement.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.454
I know we said no contact.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.095
But I couldn't stay away any longer.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.696
Well, I'd better be going.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.494
No, Donna, don't, I'm sorry...

33:25.169 --> 33:26.466
You remember Jesse, don't you?

33:27.372 --> 33:28.999
- Sure.
- Nice to see you again, Donna.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.299
Hi. You too.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.111
Nice to see you again, Andrea.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.372
Nice to see you.

33:46.257 --> 33:47.519
Well, you know, I did.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.627
Well, I hope Mom is better on a plane
than she was on the bus.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.423
On the trip out here,
every time we transferred,

33:53.598 --> 33:55.657
she was convinced
we were on the wrong one.

33:55.833 --> 33:58.131
And I'd have to double check
with the driver, of course.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.070
Well, something tells me
she might get by without you.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.731
Although, I don't know how,
I don't know how I ever did.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.975
She'll find somebody to help her.
She always does, you know.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.774
Yeah.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.811
Do you think my mother's pretty?

34:13.150 --> 34:15.516
Of course I do. You know that.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.620
Do you think I'm gonna be as pretty
as she is?

34:18.589 --> 34:21.023
Sweetheart,
you are gonna be a knockout.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.188
Dylan, I really want you to like us.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.355
Well, I do like you.
I mean, I like you an awful lot.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.331
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't hit you
with this pillow all the time.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.163
What are you talking about?

34:33.838 --> 34:36.237
When you and Mom got in that fight,
it really scared me.

34:37.175 --> 34:40.406
Listen, we're family now.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.170
You and me.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.077
And there are always gonna be
some bumps along the way.

34:46.551 --> 34:50.748
Well, I hope you won't get angry at me
when I tell you what I did.

34:53.123 --> 34:55.319
I'm not gonna like this
very much, am I?

34:55.827 --> 34:58.887
I went into my mom's purse
when she wasn't looking.

34:59.063 --> 35:00.530
I got something for you.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.131
What?

35:03.234 --> 35:04.861
Her Social Security card.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.572
I only did it
because I knew you wanted it.

35:10.508 --> 35:12.271
Are you mad at me?

35:18.149 --> 35:19.912
<i>The Shaq,
who's covered off to Nick Anderson.</i>

35:20.084 --> 35:22.348
<i>Anderson drives through the paint
and hits...</i>

35:22.520 --> 35:23.817
- D'Shawn.
- Hey, coz.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.285
<i>Quite a game tonight. He's got...</i>

35:25.456 --> 35:28.755
- You heard about it?
- Yeah, I was listening to the game.

35:28.926 --> 35:30.393
Sorry.

35:30.561 --> 35:33.689
We were up by 14 and lose by 10.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.958
Someone could say
you were the difference.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.534
- Great first half.
- Yeah.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.500
Then in the second half,
what do I do?

35:40.671 --> 35:43.401
Out of the gate,
I sky when I shouldn't have.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.700
I didn't have to jam it home.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.367
I could have just went off the glass,
but no, I had to showboat.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.843
Come on, man. This isn't the time
to get down on yourself.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.140
Right.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.715
I got months to get into that.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.675
Maybe a lifetime.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.522
Come on, man, you're not
the first guy that ever went down.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.750
What'd the doctor say?

36:03.261 --> 36:04.888
Surgery.

36:05.062 --> 36:08.293
- Arthroscopic, you understand?
- Yeah.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.832
They say I'm through for the season.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.163
Who knows how long
I'll be on those sticks.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.430
Well, if anyone can make it back,
you can.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.767
I'm gonna try, but I gotta be realistic.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.500
No NBA team's gonna go first round

36:19.677 --> 36:21.611
for any college guy
whose wheels come off.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.340
Till you can prove them wrong,

36:23.514 --> 36:26.381
you'll just have to concentrate
on being a scholar.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.185
Here it comes.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.846
I figured you'd be dogging me
about not showing for the test.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.354
But I did it, man.

36:36.527 --> 36:40.088
Between interviews,
I had the PR director fedex it back.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.562
Although I don't think I did too well.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.030
I think you did all right.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.730
I ran into Randall this morning.
He asked me to give you this.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.069
You got a C.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.438
I got a C.

36:57.848 --> 37:01.340
You met your eligibility requirement
all by yourself.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.919
- It's a hell of a start, man.
- Yeah.

37:04.088 --> 37:08.184
Except if I don't play, all those perks
I have, including a tutor, are history.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.218
I think you'll be fine.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.090
If I need a buddy to study with,
you'll still be around?

37:13.264 --> 37:14.822
You're stuck with me, man.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.024
But next time, you'll get a B, huh?

37:17.201 --> 37:18.498
Yeah.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.199
Hey.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.742
- Yeah.
- It's cool.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.307
Hey, John, come on.
Everyone's already in.

37:32.483 --> 37:33.780
Let's get this over with.

37:33.951 --> 37:35.543
Afterwards,
we'll go get something to eat.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.915
You bet.
I just wish I could figure it out.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.818
Figure what out?

37:40.358 --> 37:44.226
- Who did call security that night?
- Are you serious?

37:44.395 --> 37:46.056
I did.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.164
That makes no sense. If you didn't
want Sanders in the house,

37:49.333 --> 37:51.324
then you could've blocked him
when he was a pledge.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.094
Why would you go
to all this trouble?

37:53.271 --> 37:54.636
After he messed me up with Kelly

37:54.805 --> 37:56.830
and that stunt he pulled
at the Downey house,

37:57.008 --> 37:59.408
man, he deserves to suffer.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.670
Now let's bury him.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.179
Before you sit
John Sears and Steve Sanders.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.221
Sanders claims that John
was responsible

38:14.392 --> 38:15.825
for his arrest during hazing.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.925
John denies it.

38:18.095 --> 38:19.892
It's one brother's word
against another.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.561
Now, you've each
received one black ball.

38:22.733 --> 38:23.859
When your turn comes to vote,

38:24.035 --> 38:25.764
you will drop the ball
into one of the bowls.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.934
You must vote
against one brother or the other.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.835
There will be no abstentions.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.839
The brother
with the most black balls

38:33.210 --> 38:35.644
will be dropped
immediately from the fraternity.

38:36.047 --> 38:41.075
And remember, a fraternity
is only as strong as its members.

38:41.919 --> 38:44.581
From now until the end,
your silence is expected.

38:45.156 --> 38:49.183
There will be no talking
until the last ball is dropped.

38:51.562 --> 38:53.462
Let us begin.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.127
Hold it. What are you doing, man?

39:29.300 --> 39:30.392
Is this some kind of joke?

39:30.568 --> 39:33.093
- No talking.
- No. He made a mistake.

39:33.270 --> 39:34.828
- Pick it up, Keith.
- I can't.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.235
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry, John.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.070
If you'd set up Steve, what's to say
you won't do the same to us?

39:40.244 --> 39:42.212
Shut up. Continue the vote.

41:07.998 --> 41:12.094
Are you burning the midnight oil,
or are you listening to David?

41:12.703 --> 41:14.796
At least I know where he is.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.872
I still can't believe
he didn't come home today.

41:17.575 --> 41:18.769
He'll be back tomorrow.

41:18.943 --> 41:22.572
Yeah, well, for someone who caused
it all, he sure isn't taking it too well.

41:23.714 --> 41:25.545
You know,
you should really get some sleep.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.707
Kel, what should I do?

41:27.885 --> 41:32.049
I mean, I don't even think sex
is the issue anymore.

41:33.357 --> 41:34.449
What's left for me?

41:34.625 --> 41:36.058
Dye my hair?

41:36.227 --> 41:37.694
- Donna...
- Get a boob job? What?

41:37.862 --> 41:40.023
I'm being serious.

41:41.298 --> 41:44.131
He was so mean
to me yesterday, Kel.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.668
Just tell me what I'm doing wrong.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.863
<i>That was a dynamite cut...</i>

41:50.040 --> 41:51.473
<i>What was it?</i>

41:51.976 --> 41:53.341
<i>Never mind.</i>

41:53.511 --> 41:55.342
<i>Shoot, where's the...?</i>

41:55.513 --> 41:57.208
<i>Hold on.</i>

41:57.381 --> 41:58.780
Way to be prepared, David.

41:58.949 --> 42:03.443
Stop, it's gotta be rough on him,
doing the show and taking finals.

42:03.621 --> 42:07.079
<i>Oh, yeah, there are some new testing
times that you should know about.</i>

42:07.258 --> 42:09.783
<i>Damn it. Hold on.</i>

42:11.695 --> 42:14.425
Listen to him. He's falling apart.

42:14.865 --> 42:18.562
Maybe I should just move out now
before I completely ruin him.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.639
Donna, I don't think
that you're David's problem.

42:23.908 --> 42:27.400
I've been watching him all week,
and I think that something's got him.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.011
And it's not too much coffee.

42:30.648 --> 42:32.206
Like what?

42:32.917 --> 42:33.975
Like drugs.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.016
David? No way.

42:36.186 --> 42:39.155
No, when my mom went into relapse,
she acted just like this.

42:39.323 --> 42:42.349
She had huge mood swings,
acting all secretive all the time.

42:42.526 --> 42:43.720
Oh, great. What are you saying?

42:43.894 --> 42:47.921
- I've driven him to drugs now?
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

42:48.098 --> 42:50.589
Look, I'm probably wrong, okay?

42:50.768 --> 42:53.100
It's just that he's been acting
so strange.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.138
Well, couldn't it be that...

42:55.306 --> 42:57.467
That he's hurting
just as much as I am?

42:59.610 --> 43:02.272
You're right, that's probably it.

43:15.826 --> 43:19.023
<i>Hi, this is Howard. Leave a message
or call me at the station.</i>

43:19.196 --> 43:20.925
Howard, where the hell are you?

43:21.098 --> 43:24.534
Right here.
Jeez, I said I was coming.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.863
Yeah, before the show, man.
I've been dying out here.

43:27.037 --> 43:29.437
- Where's the stuff?
- Listen, Silver, I am not a dealer.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.700
- Don't treat me like one.
- Okay, fine, I'm sorry.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.366
Just please, tell me you have it.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.714
Will you get a grip?
Crank's not an everyday drug.

43:41.885 --> 43:43.250
It will fry your brain.

43:43.420 --> 43:45.479
- Now you tell me.
- I thought you could handle it.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.920
I can. Look, I just have to
get through the week, okay?

43:48.092 --> 43:50.117
So I can get on with my life.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.826
Do you want a hit?
I have some extra juice.

43:54.999 --> 43:57.467
No. And don't come to me
for drugs anymore, all right?

43:57.635 --> 44:00.035
Because I don't wanna
be worrying about you.

44:07.811 --> 44:09.608
No worries.
