[woman speaking indistinctly on radio]

00:26.192 --> 00:28.194
[indistinct chatter]

00:46.796 --> 00:50.550
WHO WANTED HIM DEAD?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.597
[man] Last one.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.890
Have a good one, guys.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.268
[mariachi song playing]

01:05.440 --> 01:06.983
[in Spanish] Fucking soldiers are here.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.950
[mariachi song continues playing]

01:21.623 --> 01:23.083
[Héctor] Luís, we're here!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.048
We got the photo back -

01:30.548 --> 01:31.508
Look at the photo.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.176
First one we took.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.220
-She's beautiful.
-Thanks -

01:35.303 --> 01:37.806
You're boring the man already.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.310
What's up, Fide?

01:43.061 --> 01:44.020
Morning.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.064
Fueling up already?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.733
-What about you?
-Nah, I'm straight.

01:56.908 --> 01:57.784
That shit'll kill you.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.953
[Héctor] Might be
an interesting way to die.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.124
Berni.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.208
How's it going?

02:06.084 --> 02:08.586
-Good. You?
-Last stop.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.505
Take it easy.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.464
Want a drink?

02:11.548 --> 02:12.507
[man] No, thanks.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.550
More for me.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.052
[people screaming]

02:18.179 --> 02:19.389
[Gabriel groaning]

02:19.472 --> 02:21.474
[men shouting]

02:25.019 --> 02:25.979
Kid…

02:28.356 --> 02:30.358
[theme song playing]

03:57.779 --> 03:59.781
-[imperceptible]
-[phone ringing]

04:00.865 --> 04:03.785
[Isaac] Heard Salgado's gonna hire
a security company.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.747
With armed guards.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.251
How? With what money?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.461
For the delivery trucks?

04:13.544 --> 04:14.671
For the office.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.632
[Isabella] That's good.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.550
I guess.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.970
That we need armed security?

04:28.142 --> 04:29.852
Cops won't do a fucking thing.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.941
[Isaac] Heard we're having
the office phones swept for bugs.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.277
Where are you getting all this?

04:37.819 --> 04:38.736
Gloria.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.738
Gloria in accounting?

04:41.447 --> 04:45.034
Says she heard a funny clicking
on the line last week.

04:49.622 --> 04:53.710
[Andréa in English] <i>It wasn't declared,</i>
<i>but we were living through a war.</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:58.756
<i>And in war,</i>
<i>the first casualty is the truth.</i>

05:09.726 --> 05:11.894
[Rebollo] <i>We have a lead on our targets.</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:18.234
Cell phone calls have been made
out of this area

05:19.193 --> 05:20.695
two or three times a day,

05:21.612 --> 05:24.073
to a number in the Colonia Morelos

05:24.157 --> 05:27.285
which we believe
belongs to the girlfriend of one of them.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.749
The signal is coming from
this unfinished apartment complex

05:32.832 --> 05:34.125
owned by their father.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.920
Two teams will enter the south lobby

05:38.004 --> 05:40.423
and sweep the building bottom to top.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.717
The subjects are armed.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.635
[in Spanish] Dismissed.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.227
[Walt in English]
Curious when this came in, sir.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.563
Why am I just hearing about it now?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.442
Intelligence is fluid.
You're getting it now.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.862
What is this shit, man?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.490
Payback, hopefully.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.835
[man speaking indistinctly on radio]

06:18.419 --> 06:20.213
[in Spanish] Yo. He's coming. [kisses]

06:31.307 --> 06:32.809
[prisoner] Nice and pressed.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.732
[radio chatter continues]

06:44.070 --> 06:47.240
Little tighter on this side, sweetheart.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.993
Watch the ear.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.252
Your visitor's here, sir.

06:59.877 --> 07:00.711
[Chapo] Thanks.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.046
Hey!

07:03.297 --> 07:04.590
I'm about out.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.678
What do you think, Neto?

07:11.764 --> 07:12.682
Not bad.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.852
[door buzzer sounds]

07:18.604 --> 07:19.522
[Chapo] Mayo!

07:20.898 --> 07:22.942
-Joaquín.
-What a pleasure, man.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.611
How are you, brother?

07:26.612 --> 07:29.031
Like the first guy I killed.

07:29.907 --> 07:30.783
Fucked.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.704
Heard about Azul?

07:36.205 --> 07:37.373
Yeah, man.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.546
Fucking Arellanos.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.466
Yeah.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.847
Long drive from Mazatlán.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.807
Yeah.

07:56.684 --> 08:01.939
Wanted to ask about that offer
you made me. See if it still stands.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.402
Joining up with Sinaloa.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.405
You kidding?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.283
Sinaloa's done, man.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.453
Shit's good as dead.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
I got some ideas.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.632
To put Sinaloa back where it belongs.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.515
[lawyer] Francisco's been
transferred out of military custody.

08:36.307 --> 08:40.311
If he's questioned again,
one of us will be present.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.731
Do you know if he's getting enough to eat?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.817
What are you doing to get him out?

08:48.986 --> 08:51.072
They can't just release him.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.909
Keep working the Prosecutor.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.662
Everyone has a price.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.792
Ramón, show these gentlemen out.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.628
-[Ramón sighs]
-[lawyer] Thank you.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.463
Excuse me.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.010
[Benjamín] <i>Didn't think</i>
<i>shit could get worse.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:16.639
[Enedina over phone] <i>We had</i>
<i>to do something, Benjamín.</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:19.225
Still, you imagine what Amado's planning?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.142
[Enedina] <i>Yeah.</i>

09:22.144 --> 09:23.854
How'd it go with the lawyers?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.482
He isn't getting out.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.987
<i>Normal isn't coming back.</i>

09:33.114 --> 09:34.115
[sighs]

09:34.198 --> 09:36.117
We need product.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.494
You making any progress?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.747
Might have something with the FARC.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.166
<i>The fucking Peruvians, maybe.</i>

09:46.127 --> 09:50.006
The shit we got going on…
they all have concerns.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.552
<i>You know I've been praying.</i>

09:57.013 --> 09:59.974
Just hope God's still on our side.

10:01.475 --> 10:06.564
We don't find product -
God's not gonna save us Benjamín.

10:09.900 --> 10:14.363
Ruth's new medicine, it isn't working.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.867
Not like we hoped.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.120
Doctors say I shouldn't worry.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.164
She's like you.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.207
She's a fighter.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.795
We're gonna be okay.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
<i>As long as nothing happens</i>
<i>to you, Benjamín.</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:35.676
No. Nothing will happen to me.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.803
<i>I'll call when I have something.</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:39.263
All right.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.183
[phone disconnects]

10:43.017 --> 10:44.852
[man] <i>No, man. Please!</i>

10:45.603 --> 10:48.606
It wasn't fucking me! I swear…

10:49.732 --> 10:52.068
Didn't say shit to nobody! [coughs]

10:53.069 --> 10:55.488
Maybe the kid's telling the truth.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.116
-[man grunts, coughs]
-[Rogelio] Someone fucking talked.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.951
Give me a cigarette, partner.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.333
Son of a bitch.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.543
Think I broke something.
Hand's killing me -

11:09.627 --> 11:10.461
Let me see.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.714
[man groans]

11:13.798 --> 11:14.632
That hurt?

11:14.715 --> 11:16.133
[grunts] Just said it hurt, didn't I?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.469
If it were broken, you'd be screaming.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.637
Let's go.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.518
[Rogelio] Okay. Get outta here -

11:26.685 --> 11:27.895
-[groans]
-[Rogelio] Fuck off.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.983
-[Victor] Come on, dude.
-[gunshots]

11:37.947 --> 11:39.657
[Rogelio] Vicente says there's a snitch.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.741
[lighter clicking]

11:42.201 --> 11:43.244
He wants a body.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.916
Let's go, partner!

11:50.459 --> 11:52.795
[Salgado] <i>We've faced danger before,</i>

11:54.130 --> 11:56.257
but somehow it feels different every time.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.760
In light of the attack

12:00.469 --> 12:02.721
and the possibility of more violence…

12:04.265 --> 12:05.766
<i>La Voz</i> will no longer be using bylines.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.230
Wait.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.442
You're taking names off our stories?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.569
It's safer.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.405
As editor, I have to assume some risk.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.868
I'm not willing to ask anyone else to.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.122
What kind of message
will that send to our readers?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.418
[Salgado sighs]

12:32.501 --> 12:35.004
That's everything. Come on.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.213
Get to work.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.469
[Andréa] <i>We can't back down now…</i>

12:42.636 --> 12:45.347
We're a target 'cause <i>La Voz</i>
prints the truth. No matter what.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
That's why we all work here -

12:47.266 --> 12:49.351
I don't need a history lesson.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.688
The next president of Mexico
was assassinated -

12:52.771 --> 12:55.399
and no one trusts the government
to tell us who did it.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.610
The country's losing itself.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.322
Removing bylines says
we can be intimidated.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.323
That we're scared.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.909
And what if we are?

13:05.826 --> 13:08.329
People can't trust scared reporters.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.334
Back down now, we won't have
to worry about more threats -

13:15.669 --> 13:17.630
'Cause no one's gonna take
<i>La Voz</i> seriously.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.266
This paper matters.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.440
I'm not interested in producing
more martyrs to journalistic integrity.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.318
This is our new policy.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.906
It doesn't meet your approval,
find somewhere else to work.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.791
[Santos sniffles]

13:55.251 --> 13:57.127
[breathes deeply]

13:57.920 --> 13:58.754
[Santos] So?

14:00.297 --> 14:01.507
Still have a job?

14:05.135 --> 14:08.013
You like seeing your name
in print more than anyone here.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.892
How are you okay with this?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.981
'Cause I think he's right.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.402
He's doing it to protect us.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.905
[Andréa breathes deeply]

14:24.989 --> 14:26.699
We're all here for a reason.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.954
You should know, it's not just the truck.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.748
There's been other threats.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.378
Besides, it's not my fight anymore.

14:44.133 --> 14:44.967
I'm leaving.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.595
Told Salgado this morning.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.472
What are you talking about?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.478
I've got Vera at home.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.107
Alonso's headed to college next year.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.193
I won't put them through this Andréa.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.279
You're quitting.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.530
[Santos] Mmm-mmm.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.658
I'm running away.
There's a difference. [chuckles]

15:13.329 --> 15:19.793
There's half a novel sitting in
a desk at home, mocking me.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.131
It's my time.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.681
Or maybe I'm just showing
my true colors, right?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.189
I'm sorry.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.111
You don't have to apologize, Marcos.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.574
I get it.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.833
Go easy on him.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.379
Yourself too.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.139
[Brandon in English over TV]
<i>Let's get going.</i>

16:14.223 --> 16:16.225
<i>We'll have a great time</i>
<i>once we get on the road.</i>

16:16.850 --> 16:20.354
<i>Donna, nobody takes shoulder pads</i>

16:21.730 --> 16:23.607
[chatter continues over TV]

16:23.691 --> 16:25.234
[Alfredo coughs]

16:34.994 --> 16:37.371
<i>Yo, Dylan! What's bumpin'? Nice wheels.</i>

16:37.454 --> 16:39.248
[Alfredo in Spanish] Be fun to live there.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.750
[in English] <i>She's got everything.</i>
<i>Four-wheel drive, cruise control…</i>

16:41.834 --> 16:43.252
[in Spanish] L.A. is cool.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.549
When you think we can go home?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.302
Couple more weeks, shit'll settle down.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.141
Be fucking kings when we go back.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.022
Been thinking of going back to school.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.901
Abroad. Someplace cool.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.124
Gonna go out for snacks.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.501
Wait till it gets dark.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.586
[phone ringing]

17:27.087 --> 17:28.088
Move -

17:39.141 --> 17:40.350
[phone continues ringing]

17:41.310 --> 17:44.104
Seriously, don't be a bitch. Stay here.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.025
Hey, baby.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.235
How are you?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.490
Yeah. I'm alone.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.246
What're you wearing?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.418
[continues speaking indistinctly]

18:19.014 --> 18:19.848
[soldier 1] Stop!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.267
[soldier 2] Stop!

18:22.351 --> 18:23.352
Put the weapon down!

18:24.603 --> 18:26.522
-[men shouting]
-[gunshots]

18:37.157 --> 18:38.575
[Providencio] Check everything!

18:40.702 --> 18:41.537
[Alex grunts]

18:45.582 --> 18:46.416
Shit -

19:02.266 --> 19:03.308
[in English] He in there?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.102
Found an open window.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.728
Probably heard the shots.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
Shit.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.066
[in Spanish] Enough.
Get him back to the base.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.947
[Walt in English] Remember me, Alex?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.585
[mellow music playing over speakers]

19:38.594 --> 19:39.761
[Victor] The names you wanted.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.393
Want some coffee?

19:47.352 --> 19:48.228
No.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.025
[clears throat]

19:56.153 --> 19:59.406
Do you mind if, um, we switch places?

20:23.138 --> 20:27.851
This, uh… Flaco Masvidal,
got a real first name on him?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.020
No.

20:30.938 --> 20:31.897
Nothin' else?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.732
I got you everything I could last time.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.860
This shit is not easy, you know?

20:39.571 --> 20:43.075
Hit them soon.
They change spots every two weeks.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.623
You said it was gonna be a few days. Hmm?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.209
Got those lab results or not?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.965
All this, how solid is it?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.760
Those Dutch houses you hit last week,
that solid?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.054
That fucking punk from Mission Hills,

21:04.137 --> 21:05.931
how solid was he? Hmm? That solid?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.642
-I'm just doin' my job.
-You're doing your job?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.104
They got us hunting a snitch
on the other side of the river.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.774
My information is good.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.320
You think you're in danger?

21:23.031 --> 21:24.283
I want my results now.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.540
Not sure you're going to like it.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.339
[in Spanish] What the hell is this?

21:39.423 --> 21:40.841
[in English] What is this?
I don't understand.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.427
The results were inconclusive, basically.

21:43.510 --> 21:47.097
The sample was contaminated.
DNA is very touchy.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.267
Um, what I can tell you is
your sample came from a male.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.893
-[table clatters]
-[in Spanish] You fucking kidding me?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.229
[in English] No shit, it came from a man.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.903
Maybe if you told me what this was about.
What you were lookin' for--

22:01.987 --> 22:04.781
You told me you could do this.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.159
I need a name. I need a fucking match.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.828
I promised a test.
I got you the test, it didn't work.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.706
-Next time you get me a--
-Fuck next time.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.207
Fuck next time.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.502
Look, hey. You keep helping me,
I'll keep helping you.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.172
Maybe we can switch things up.
Put you on the payroll.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.466
[in Spanish] Fuck you, man.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.286
[Amado] Shit.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.209
Always come for what we love.

22:57.292 --> 23:01.171
Was old, but she still had
a few good years left.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.592
Thought I did too man…

23:08.553 --> 23:12.015
Arellanos only make these moves
if they're desperate.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.018
Losing control.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.358
Usually can see these things coming.

23:22.776 --> 23:26.279
That's the game.
We fuck each other over…

23:28.448 --> 23:30.951
The Arellanos helped me take Félix down.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.578
Just means they've had practice.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.706
Numbers you're doing…

23:37.833 --> 23:40.335
you're bigger than Félix ever dreamed.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.671
What'd you expect?

23:45.549 --> 23:46.633
Look, Amado…

23:47.384 --> 23:49.177
I decided to make a move…

23:51.930 --> 23:53.598
I'm with Sinaloa now.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.602
You tracked down Güero?

23:59.437 --> 24:00.272
Chapo.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.982
In prison.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.444
Fucking Chapo.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.740
You know Sinaloa's basically
worth shit, right?

24:10.824 --> 24:11.867
True.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.328
But they still got soldiers.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.248
Just need leadership organizing.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.208
Still no border crossing.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.338
How much longer you see
the Arellanos needing theirs?

24:29.217 --> 24:30.886
I know that plaza.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.723
Moved my product
through Tijuana for years.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.979
You want to put Sinaloa to work
in the Arellanos' plaza?

24:42.981 --> 24:45.734
Army's already got Benjamín scrambling.

24:48.153 --> 24:53.366
We hit his bottom line,
start to fuck with his money, product…

24:54.868 --> 24:57.579
Move smart, but above all,

24:58.747 --> 25:00.540
keep everything quiet.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.168
Quiet's nice.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.171
You've always worn it well.

25:08.506 --> 25:09.883
What would you need from me?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.302
Chapo already has men.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.555
What I don't have is cash product.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.849
To help us get going.

25:33.531 --> 25:37.535
Never understood what you see in all this.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.537
These boats and shit.

25:40.163 --> 25:43.458
Seems like nothing but problems.
Always something new.

25:43.959 --> 25:44.793
[scoffs]

25:46.002 --> 25:48.129
You sail out there…

25:49.422 --> 25:51.841
your problems stay here.

25:53.009 --> 25:53.843
Far away.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.854
Okay, Mayo.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.192
I'll advance you cash product…

26:11.987 --> 26:14.114
But the fucking Arellanos, they die.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.789
-And the shooters who came at me--
-First ones to go.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.375
No. Give 'em to my brother.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.005
<i>He takes things more personally than me.</i>

26:47.522 --> 26:48.606
[phone ringing]

26:50.692 --> 26:53.069
-Hello -
-[Alfredo] <i>Hey, Ramón.</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:54.195
<i>What's up, Alfredo?</i>

26:54.279 --> 26:55.697
Ramón, it's all gone to shit -

26:56.281 --> 27:00.827
I know it's bad out there. Come hang out--

27:00.910 --> 27:02.579
They took my brother!

27:04.039 --> 27:05.081
What the fuck are you saying?

27:05.165 --> 27:08.501
I don't know what happened,
the army came and took him.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.503
It's all gone to shit!

27:35.612 --> 27:37.405
[in English] The General
had some visitors.

27:45.622 --> 27:46.539
[soldier in Spanish] Hold up -

27:46.623 --> 27:49.626
General Rebollo wants the prisoner
brought to Building C.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.627
Yes, sir.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.089
[in English] Where the fuck's Building C?

28:01.971 --> 28:04.349
-[speaking indistinctly]
-[phone rings in background]

28:04.432 --> 28:05.934
[Walt] Got a second, sir?

28:06.017 --> 28:08.311
-Have a seat.
-I'm good.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.648
What's going on with Alex Hodoyan?

28:12.941 --> 28:13.983
"Building C"?

28:17.570 --> 28:21.741
Look, I understand after what happened
with Fausto, you're looking to--

28:21.825 --> 28:23.910
This is not about Fausto.

28:26.454 --> 28:29.040
Francisco Arellano,
what did he get us, huh?

28:30.375 --> 28:31.793
His arrest was public.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.837
Lawyers intervened,

28:33.920 --> 28:37.632
and we lost any chance we had
to learn something.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.596
Alex Hodoyan gives us a new opportunity.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.765
No one knows he is here.

28:45.849 --> 28:50.061
Instead of charging him,
we detained him unofficially.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.439
And we see what he tells us.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.401
And if he doesn't talk?

28:58.278 --> 29:01.406
Rich kid like him,
we let his imagination go to work.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.616
Not be a problem.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.662
I got a call today with my supervisor.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.748
DEA wants an update.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.668
Tell 'em what you want.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.546
But the lawyers get involved,
Alex Hodoyan goes away.

29:20.216 --> 29:23.219
-How much time do you need?
-Forty-eight hours.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.430
He will talk.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.519
I'll give you 24.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.606
Then we put him into custody.
Play it straight.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.526
I'll let San Diego know.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.403
Twenty-four. Agreed.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.948
Keep me in the loop.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.872
[sighs]

29:51.331 --> 29:52.540
[Alex in Spanish] <i>Who's there?</i>

29:53.541 --> 29:54.584
Hello?

29:55.794 --> 29:56.961
[grunting]

30:04.469 --> 30:06.095
[panting]

30:12.727 --> 30:13.978
[both grunting]

30:37.043 --> 30:38.461
[crying]

30:54.102 --> 30:55.478
[dog barking]

31:01.401 --> 31:02.819
[line ringing]

31:06.739 --> 31:09.325
-[Dani] <i>Hello.</i>
-Hey, it's me.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.704
<i>I didn't expect for you to answer.</i>

31:14.831 --> 31:16.416
I've been meaning to call you back.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.586
<i>'Cause I just needed some time.</i>

31:20.837 --> 31:22.839
-How's Chicago?
<i>-Good.</i>

31:23.673 --> 31:24.674
<i>School's good.</i>

31:25.717 --> 31:27.051
I like my students.

31:29.804 --> 31:30.763
Where are you?

31:31.848 --> 31:35.894
Military base, sort of, outside Tijuana.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.772
Look, when this is all done…

31:41.065 --> 31:42.525
I wanna come see you.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.986
<i>Get things back on track. I…</i>

31:48.990 --> 31:51.868
-Walt, I can't do this.
-Look, Dani, please.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.539
I just needed to see this thing through.

31:58.458 --> 32:02.128
<i>Put it behind me. I want to move on.</i>

32:02.211 --> 32:03.129
Walt…

32:03.922 --> 32:09.010
<i>You lie to the guys you're working with,</i>
<i>you lie to your bosses…</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:11.304
<i>You're good at it.</i> [chuckles]

32:12.305 --> 32:13.264
<i>You have to be.</i>

32:14.515 --> 32:18.978
I think that makes it easier
to start to lie to yourself.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.775
It's not like that.

32:25.902 --> 32:26.861
<i>Dani…</i>

32:27.946 --> 32:29.530
Take it easy on yourself, Walt.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.327
<i>Good luck. I mean it.</i>

32:35.286 --> 32:36.287
[line disconnects]

32:54.055 --> 32:57.350
[Chapo in Spanish] <i>Heard back from Mayo.</i>
<i>Amado went for it.</i>

32:58.226 --> 32:59.686
[Neto] Interesting.

33:00.853 --> 33:03.189
[Chapo] He's sending some shit
up to Tijuana now.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.531
Welcome to Tijuana, bro.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.826
[Chapo] <i>You think Mayo's idea can work?</i>

33:15.868 --> 33:17.745
We tried taking on
the Arellanos once before -

33:17.829 --> 33:19.914
That shit was a disaster.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.460
All depends how you play it.
Couple ways it could go.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.379
The first way?

33:27.255 --> 33:31.843
You go at them hard. Get crazy.

33:31.926 --> 33:35.179
Hope you end up on top.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.474
But bangin' it out
in the streets with them -

33:39.225 --> 33:41.185
you don't stand a fucking chance.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.856
<i>Or, you start small…</i>

33:48.192 --> 33:50.194
[men shouting]

33:51.821 --> 33:52.822
…like cancer.

33:53.990 --> 33:58.036
Starts in the lungs, then the liver.
Next thing you know, you're fucked.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.078
Get lost!

33:59.746 --> 34:00.580
[man mutters]

34:02.498 --> 34:03.958
That'll be Mayo's play.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.170
<i>He knows how Tijuana works.</i>

34:08.254 --> 34:11.132
<i>The independent guys</i>
<i>who pay tax to use the plaza…</i>

34:11.966 --> 34:13.926
<i>They're what keep the Arellanos alive…</i>

34:15.219 --> 34:16.637
So what's he do with them?

34:18.014 --> 34:19.724
Starts changing some minds.

34:22.935 --> 34:27.440
<i>Give 'em reason to rethink</i>
<i>who they work for.</i>

34:28.274 --> 34:29.358
[Beltrán] Who's next?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.569
[man screaming]

34:38.242 --> 34:41.287
[Neto] <i>Show 'em</i>
<i>the Arellanos aren't in control.</i>

34:45.666 --> 34:47.502
And cracks start to form.

34:49.003 --> 34:49.879
No.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.382
Wait! Look, I'll do it.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.052
For real!

34:56.135 --> 34:57.553
Fuck the Arellanos -

34:58.304 --> 35:00.181
I wanna work with you!

35:05.269 --> 35:06.687
[shushes]

35:09.107 --> 35:10.108
[Romo sniffles]

35:17.365 --> 35:18.533
[Mayo] Smart kid.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.576
Welcome to the family.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.371
[Neto] It's a long game.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.082
Takes patience…

35:26.791 --> 35:29.168
The right information. Cash too…

35:33.047 --> 35:34.757
That's why Mayo needs Amado.

35:37.593 --> 35:38.761
Can we trust him?

35:39.428 --> 35:40.304
My nephew?

35:41.139 --> 35:41.973
No.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.724
[laughs]

35:44.684 --> 35:46.352
But what choice do you have?

35:49.939 --> 35:55.194
<i>It works, he can always wipe Sinaloa out</i>
<i>after you've done the heavy lifting.</i>

35:55.862 --> 35:58.906
<i>It doesn't, Sinaloa goes down.</i>

35:59.615 --> 36:01.450
<i>Either way, he's good.</i>

36:04.662 --> 36:07.123
Doesn't feel right
making these decisions without Güero.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.086
In this world, you're looking for "right"?

36:14.130 --> 36:15.464
He's still the boss.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.759
Güero had his time, but he's on the run.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.846
And that won't last.

36:23.639 --> 36:24.765
He's done.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.978
Mayo needs <i>you.</i>

36:31.105 --> 36:32.648
Güero Palma doesn't play a role.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.194
How this thing goes.

36:42.742 --> 36:43.618
[Chapo sighs]

36:43.701 --> 36:47.371
Either way, I'm still locked in here.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.249
Till one day you're not.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.378
Should think about what's next.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.299
What you want out of all this.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.306
Cold as fuck out here. [grunts]

37:17.860 --> 37:19.862
[indistinct chatter]

37:28.120 --> 37:32.458
MISSING

37:42.093 --> 37:44.262
[in English] Hey. It's starting.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.782
[in Spanish] Where've you been, Enedina?

38:04.865 --> 38:06.867
I called you ten times!

38:07.618 --> 38:09.662
-What?
-The fucking army…

38:11.706 --> 38:14.500
They have Alex Hodoyan.
Alfredo called me -

38:16.836 --> 38:17.712
How much does he know?

38:17.795 --> 38:21.465
Nothing. He's a kid.
Did a few runs and shit.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.677
Not Alex. Alfredo. How much does he know?

38:27.179 --> 38:29.724
Alfredo? He's cool.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.019
What's going on? Where've you been?

38:33.978 --> 38:35.187
Warehouse on Batiz.

38:36.105 --> 38:36.939
It was hit.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.611
-[cell phone ringing]
-Hit by who?

38:45.281 --> 38:46.115
What's up?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.037
What?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.373
No, leave them.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.584
I want to see it.

38:57.752 --> 38:58.753
[horns honks]

38:58.836 --> 39:00.046
[indistinct chatter]

39:00.880 --> 39:04.216
<i>…The men we sent to Juárez.</i>
<i>To handle Amado.</i>

39:04.800 --> 39:06.635
[sirens wailing]

39:11.640 --> 39:12.808
What about the warehouse?

39:17.313 --> 39:19.732
Dina, what the fuck is going on?

39:21.525 --> 39:22.651
We're at war.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.157
Fuck Amado.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.950
I'll go to Juárez myself -

39:30.618 --> 39:32.078
Isn't just him, Ramón.

39:33.412 --> 39:36.082
That warehouse was small. Unprotected.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.835
We were hit by someone who knows us.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.591
Mayo chose a side.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.691
Fuck.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.626
[Hank] Had your maid make some iced tea.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.753
It isn't very good.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.005
[Hank clears throat]

40:26.132 --> 40:27.675
To what do I owe the honor?

40:29.635 --> 40:33.347
House's come a long way… Juárez as well.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.766
You forgotten why that is?

40:36.851 --> 40:39.645
Hard work. From you and me both.

40:41.355 --> 40:45.651
We had an agreement
on how we'd handle our business.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.363
Discreet, out of the spotlight. Remember?

40:50.948 --> 40:52.783
The things I'm hearing from Tijuana…

40:53.576 --> 40:56.745
Violence, public displays…

40:56.829 --> 40:58.622
New elements being introduced.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.166
Doesn't work for me.

41:02.042 --> 41:06.464
Someone tries to kill me,
it changes things.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.382
You'll have to adapt.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.219
This is what I do.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.929
[scoffs] No.

41:14.930 --> 41:17.433
There isn't anything you "do" without me.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.310
It's my end of the business -

41:19.393 --> 41:22.521
You don't have one.
That's something you made up.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.606
Doesn't exist.

41:24.523 --> 41:28.402
This vendetta, or whatever it is,

41:28.486 --> 41:29.570
ends today.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.823
Or what?

41:34.700 --> 41:35.618
See for yourself.

41:36.243 --> 41:39.830
The Citibank accounts are frozen.
Caymans too…

41:40.581 --> 41:43.083
Till I'm sure
no more surprises are coming.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.339
This ride you're on, Amado,

41:48.964 --> 41:50.257
it can end abruptly.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.029
[phone ringing]

42:14.156 --> 42:15.157
Andréa Nuñez…

42:16.534 --> 42:17.618
[Káren] <i>Hey. It's Káren…</i>

42:18.619 --> 42:20.454
<i>From the Colosio campaign.</i>

42:20.538 --> 42:23.332
Hi Káren. How have you been?

42:24.667 --> 42:27.711
<i>Look, I might have something for you.</i>

42:28.712 --> 42:29.964
<i>Can we meet?</i>

42:31.006 --> 42:32.591
Yes, of course. Where?

42:32.675 --> 42:34.176
<i>At the Public Park.</i>

42:35.553 --> 42:37.555
[siren wailing in background]

42:40.015 --> 42:41.767
[indistinct chatter]

43:19.763 --> 43:20.598
[Victor] Excuse me -

43:21.599 --> 43:22.558
Good evening, miss.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.727
Can I ask you a question?

43:24.810 --> 43:26.437
[woman 1] Sorry, we have to go.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.688
Good evening.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.690
Good evening, miss?

43:29.773 --> 43:31.942
Please. Just a couple questions.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.040
Police -

43:46.915 --> 43:48.083
Open the door, man.

43:56.050 --> 43:57.051
Good evening.

44:00.054 --> 44:04.642
I need help.
Finding out what happened to a friend.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.686
She hasn't been home in a while.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.149
This is her.

44:16.195 --> 44:22.576
Any of you ever see a man following her?

44:24.203 --> 44:25.371
Bothering her, maybe?

44:26.622 --> 44:28.916
Please. We just want to get home.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.960
[Victor] I'm trying to help you get home.

44:33.504 --> 44:37.800
I know she worked
at the auto parts factory.

44:38.717 --> 44:42.262
Some of you must've seen her.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.060
Nobody?

44:49.895 --> 44:50.771
Hmm.

44:54.149 --> 44:56.235
I worked with her for a couple months.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.655
Is she gone, too?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.331
[Victor] When was
the last time you saw her?

45:10.290 --> 45:12.668
-On her way home.
-[Victor] Hmm.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.503
At one of the bus stops.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.132
I think someone gave her a ride.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.341
Who?

45:19.425 --> 45:20.467
A man?

45:22.928 --> 45:26.014
What kind of car? You remember?

45:26.098 --> 45:28.559
Big one, I think.

45:29.893 --> 45:30.936
Nice.

45:32.479 --> 45:33.730
An American car.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.483
Seen it around here before?

45:37.860 --> 45:39.862
[woman 2] We need to get home now.

45:42.781 --> 45:43.991
Thank you.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.562
[phone ringing]

46:19.443 --> 46:20.277
[Amado] <i>What is it?</i>

46:21.153 --> 46:22.070
[Marta] <i>It's me.</i>

46:25.449 --> 46:28.327
Look who's using the phone.

46:29.536 --> 46:33.832
Thought I'd give it a try.

46:34.541 --> 46:35.918
<i>Wanted to hear your voice.</i>

46:37.920 --> 46:42.007
<i>Things any better with work?</i>
<i>The problems you've been having…</i>

46:42.841 --> 46:46.678
Honestly, maybe worse.

46:48.680 --> 46:53.560
Maybe time you tried something new.
If you're not happy.

46:56.688 --> 46:59.024
<i>This is what I chose. You know?</i>

46:59.650 --> 47:01.151
<i>It's mine.</i>

47:01.818 --> 47:03.111
I made a decision.

47:03.195 --> 47:08.909
To see if I could build something
bigger than myself.

47:09.952 --> 47:16.917
How it ends, that's not up to me.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.837
Does it have to end?

47:21.588 --> 47:23.298
[chuckling] I don't know.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.051
It always does.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.388
<i>And you only get one?</i>

47:31.139 --> 47:32.349
One what?

47:32.432 --> 47:33.684
Choice.

47:34.851 --> 47:38.063
I change my mind every day.

47:42.568 --> 47:45.696
<i>It's late. You need to go?</i>

47:46.697 --> 47:50.409
No. I don't need to go anywhere.

47:54.871 --> 47:56.456
[soldier] <i>I don't want to hurt you.</i>

47:58.083 --> 47:59.209
<i>But I will.</i>

48:04.548 --> 48:06.091
You understand that, Alex?

48:07.884 --> 48:09.094
This is a mistake.

48:09.886 --> 48:11.555
I need to make a phone call -

48:12.180 --> 48:15.100
You're not calling anyone
till you tell us what you know.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.857
How can we find your brother?

48:21.940 --> 48:22.899
[Alex] Please.

48:24.192 --> 48:25.444
I didn't do anything.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.289
No! No!

48:41.460 --> 48:43.920
I have a dog outside.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.715
It's gonna come and eat your balls.

48:48.675 --> 48:50.135
After that, I'm going to fuck you.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.098
It's all gonna be recorded.

48:55.766 --> 48:56.767
<i>So beautiful.</i>

48:57.434 --> 48:58.977
<i>Your whole family's gonna see.</i>

48:59.061 --> 49:00.520
<i>You got a girlfriend?</i>

49:01.980 --> 49:03.732
Huh? You got a girlfriend?

49:03.815 --> 49:06.026
She's gonna see me fuck you, too.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.738
[crying] I want to talk
to the American, please.

49:11.281 --> 49:12.324
Please!

49:13.575 --> 49:15.243
<i>I know he's here -</i>

49:16.036 --> 49:17.245
[in English] What the fuck?

49:18.497 --> 49:19.665
[Alex in Spanish] <i>I'll talk to him!</i>

49:25.295 --> 49:26.338
[Walt] Take a break.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.478
Alex.

49:43.313 --> 49:45.357
[in English] You need to tell us
where your brother is.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.067
It's your only way out of here.

49:47.693 --> 49:51.071
Help me. You have to help me
or they're gonna fucking kill me.

49:52.572 --> 49:54.116
I don't have to do anything.

49:54.741 --> 49:55.992
You don't understand.

49:57.619 --> 50:00.497
I was born in La Jolla, California.

50:00.997 --> 50:02.416
I have dual citizenship.

50:03.041 --> 50:04.459
I'm American.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.046
You're full of shit.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.007
I swear, man. You can check.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.552
And you're DEA, right?

50:14.636 --> 50:16.847
You have to do something. Please.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.598
You're fuckin' lying to me.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.725
I'm not.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.103
Scripps Memorial Hospital.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.566
That's where I was born.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.194
Please, man.

50:32.362 --> 50:33.697
Don't let them hurt me.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.032
Get me out of here.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.493
Please.

50:40.495 --> 50:41.621
[Walt] <i>Is it fucking true?</i>

50:43.457 --> 50:44.374
Huh?

50:46.543 --> 50:47.419
Is it?

50:49.004 --> 50:49.963
Could be.

50:51.465 --> 50:52.758
This does not change anything.

50:53.592 --> 50:57.179
This is an American citizen
being detained illegally.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.764
Yes, it fucking does.

50:58.847 --> 51:01.641
He's a dual citizen
and no one knows he's here.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.311
No, no. This, this is fucking over.

51:05.061 --> 51:06.396
Do you understand?

51:09.441 --> 51:13.195
How long before our bosses
will pull the plug on the task force?

51:14.321 --> 51:15.238
Shut it down.

51:16.990 --> 51:19.951
Because the shock of a cardinal
getting killed in broad daylight

51:20.619 --> 51:22.871
gets replaced by some other absurdity.

51:24.414 --> 51:26.875
Breslin. Memories are short.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.336
We're close now.

51:30.128 --> 51:35.842
This kid and his brother could be key
in arresting Benjamín Arellano.

51:37.344 --> 51:38.595
That happens…

51:40.430 --> 51:41.765
we take back Tijuana.

51:46.269 --> 51:51.566
Do you know what I have given up
to have an opportunity like this?

51:55.612 --> 51:57.697
I know you made sacrifices, too.

51:59.616 --> 52:04.162
This is what it takes
for all that to mean anything.

52:06.081 --> 52:09.626
Stop now, nothing changes.

52:11.336 --> 52:13.046
We're right back where we started.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.724
All right, get him to talk.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.312
And stop fuckin' recording.

52:34.526 --> 52:35.569
[Rebollo] Providencio.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.854
[in Spanish] Damn, Alex.
You're making me work.

53:22.032 --> 53:22.908
[whimpers]

53:25.994 --> 53:27.579
[Alex crying]

53:31.082 --> 53:33.209
[muffled screams]

53:42.052 --> 53:44.054
[somber music playing]
