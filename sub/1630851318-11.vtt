WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:04.605
Nira is half-blind
because of you.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.509
You think I control Salen?
How about taking a stand?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.711
You could've worked with me
to make things right.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.146
Instead, you had to
burn the building down.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.647
She lit the match.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.416
If you're gonna
go through with this deal,

00:15.549 --> 00:16.550
you're gonna
have to destroy me.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.653
Good luck.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.822
'Cause now this is all
your problem.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.803
Your
"Unsave-the-date" card.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.907
You're...uninviting us
to your wedding?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.809
We decided
there will be no wedding

01:48.942 --> 01:50.278
for the
foreseeable future.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.445
We've canceled
everything.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.747
The way
you're smiling,

01:53.881 --> 01:56.049
I feel like I should be
congratulating you.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.920
We're happy. We just want
to enjoy being happy.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.889
We've had enough stress
in our lives.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.791
We're living
in the moment.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.393
Mm-hmm.Good morning, everyone.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.566
Thanks for coming.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.404
As the new President,
I'd like to acknowledge

02:16.537 --> 02:18.138
we've been through
a challenging time,

02:20.107 --> 02:23.544
but St. Bon's has never
been about a logo

02:23.677 --> 02:25.746
or a fancy
coffee selection.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.148
We've always been about
the people in this room

02:28.282 --> 02:31.084
and how we can help the people
who come through these doors.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.757
So we're gonna get
back to what we've
always done the best,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.326
and that's
putting patients first.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.433
You know what a world-class
surgical center needs?

02:45.566 --> 02:49.136
It needs a world-class
Chief of Surgery.

02:49.270 --> 02:53.707
And that's why
I am reinstating
Dr. Audrey Lim.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.456
I'll also be hiring
three new oncology nurses,

03:08.589 --> 03:10.958
so if you know
some good people,
let me know, okay?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.629
You okay
with all this?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.865
No more board meetings.
Are you kidding?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.033
Plus, I get a lot more time
with the clinic.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.303
Doctors Reznick,
Glassman, can I have
a word with you two?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.075
We lost
a clinic contract.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.043
Our biggest.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.045
Thanks to your confession
of borderline malpractice

03:32.179 --> 03:33.514
to the person who runs
their health plan.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.417
Nira had the right
to know the truth.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.818
You're lucky it was
an experimental procedure.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.487
She's not pursuing
a lawsuit.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.790
But I'm closing
the clinic.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.625
I'm sorry.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.860
I just can't
justify the expense
of keeping it open.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.229
People need a way
to get healthcare

03:49.363 --> 03:50.631
they otherwise
can't afford.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.500
How's this
for justification...

03:52.633 --> 03:54.568
We can,
and so we should.
Exactly.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.705
I've arranged
for Bay Area Medical
to take over their care.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.444
Can I talk to you
for one second?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.413
If I can just
take a look at the budget,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.848
I can figure out a way
to keep this clinic open.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.418
I'm afraid you're gonna be
busy in the O.R.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.386
Aaron, you're
a gifted surgeon.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.555
This hospital
needs those skills.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.390
Wow. Okay.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.825
Uh, let's talk trade.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.860
I'll give you
20 hours a week,

04:19.993 --> 04:22.696
and we figure out a way
to keep this clinic open.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.698
So you can keep freezing
plantar warts?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.770
See? Someone must need
a really good neurosurgeon.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.249
Family of three
in a head-on collision.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.817
Another ambulance
is behind us

04:43.951 --> 04:45.553
with the occupant
of the other vehicle.
Park, you're with me.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.287
Bryan Liu.
40 years old.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.956
Hypotensive in the field.
GCS ten.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.659
Abdominal bruising,

04:51.792 --> 04:54.995
some distention,
internal bleeding.
How's that leg look?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.467
We might be able
to save his arm.
I need a vascular clamp.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.934
Elaine hit her head
on the dash.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.103
GCS 15.
Vomited twice.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.304
Elaine, I'm Dr. Glassman.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.739
How bad
was your headache?
Really bad.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.608
Is my daughter okay?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.943
She was wearing her seatbelt.
She has pain and bruising
in her chest.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.945
I'm right here, honey.
Spleen's ruptured.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.847
He's got about two liters
of blood in his abdomen.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.215
What's going on
with my dad?

05:15.349 --> 05:17.585
Please don't talk.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.919
Those doctors
are taking care of him.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.154
She has decreased
left-sided breath sounds.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.523
We need
to insert a chest tube.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.791
W-Why?
What's wrong?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.826
A broken rib
punctured her lung.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.862
Left pupil's dilated.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.464
Subdural?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.766
Elaine, you may
have some bleeding
around your brain.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.468
We're gonna have to
take you to the O.R.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.537
Mommy?
I-I'm okay, sweetie.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.305
We're all gonna be
just fine.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.339
You just need to...

05:39.473 --> 05:40.774
Oh!

05:40.908 --> 05:42.042
His BP's tanking.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.577
We have to get him
to the O.R. now.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.648
Mommy.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.016
Daddy.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.334
Splenic hilum
is clamped.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.836
His pressure's holding.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.337
Below-knee
amputation is complete.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.972
The stump is covered
and healthy.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.642
Start working on
his arm.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.177
I'm not
getting any circulation
to his hand.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.013
We could use
Andrews' vascular
reconstruction skills.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.483
Try reducing the fracture
to restore blood flow.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.721
It's not helping.

06:27.855 --> 06:28.922
I've got too much
bleeding to help.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.858
Try fasciotomies
to relieve pressure.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.093
There's too much
upstream damage.

06:36.029 --> 06:36.897
Page Andrews.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.037
She has an SSS tear.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.739
We'll have to
open up her skull
to find a fix,

06:45.873 --> 06:47.775
which I do not
want to do.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.543
I can stop the leak
with a dural flap,

06:49.677 --> 06:50.844
wait till
the swelling goes down,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.313
find a better fix.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.850
Pressure's still dropping.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.855
I got a tight seal.
No leaks.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.457
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.464
I hear an
early-diastolic murmur.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.364
It's her heart.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.733
Get me an echo.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.934
Contact social work.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.203
Make sure the daughter's
not alone today.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.571
She may be losing
both her parents.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.941
How bad are they?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.810
We won't know
anything for sure

07:22.943 --> 07:24.111
until your parents
get out of surgery.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.015
The chest tube
was successful.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.651
That doctor said my mom
was bleeding in her brain.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.785
Did he stop it?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.386
They're trying.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.623
She has one of the best
neurosurgeons in the state.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.024
Did they fix
my dad's leg?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.626
I don't know yet.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.460
And I understand how scary
and confusing it must be

07:40.594 --> 07:41.629
not to have
all the answers.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.296
I just want to know
what's happening.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.801
Your dad's leg
is likely unsalvageable.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.103
He also had
a severe splenic injury

07:50.237 --> 07:53.073
that caused catastrophic
internal bleeding
and hypovolemic shock.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.142
Removing his spleen
may stop the bleeding,

07:55.275 --> 07:56.910
but if not, they may need
to remove his kidney, as well.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.679
He may also lose
his lower arm.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.915
Dr. Murphy, maybe Isla and I

08:02.049 --> 08:04.117
should chat alone
for a few minutes.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.919
It's okay. You can stay.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.722
You can go.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.258
Thank you
for talking to me.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.125
Are you sure?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.195
Okay.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.064
I'll check in later.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.498
You can always
have a nurse page me.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.940
Could my parents...die?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.444
It is too soon to say

08:31.579 --> 08:34.247
if either of them
will survive their injuries.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.178
I'll round
on Asher's patients,

09:05.312 --> 09:08.348
and the night nurse
said Mr. Jones
is ready for discharge.

09:08.481 --> 09:12.152
Um, my bowel obstruction
- in 4
- C, did he pass gas?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.454
Why do you think the nurses
want him discharged?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.191
I'm hungry.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.329
The nurse gave me a sandwich,
but it has pickles.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.196
They're gross.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.599
They are.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.000
I'd like
something else, please.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
I gotta discharge
your windbag in 4C.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.874
Nurse.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.408
Will you find
this patient

09:35.542 --> 09:37.410
something to eat
without pickles?

09:37.544 --> 09:38.779
Sure.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.754
She isn't just hungry.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.921
She's scared.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.757
She wants
to spend time with you

09:49.890 --> 09:51.759
so she doesn't feel
all alone.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.294
Doctors need to maintain
professional boundaries.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.196
Convenient,
since you don't want

09:56.329 --> 09:57.631
to get close to patients.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.434
I think it's
the most rewarding
part of our job.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.770
Oh, no.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.238
Minimally invasive
microvascular surgery

10:05.372 --> 10:07.841
is the most rewarding part.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.310
I already treated
her pneumothorax.
She's fine.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.849
Subclavian artery's
also damaged.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.951
Yeah,
brachial plexus nerves, too.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.624
Thought you'd be
a little more excited
about being Chief again.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.593
Hard to get too jubilant
about being given a job

10:26.727 --> 10:28.061
I never should have lost
in the first place.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.264
One you were happy
to step into.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.734
BP's stabilizing.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.236
This arm's a mess.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.871
There's no
distal blood supply,

10:38.005 --> 10:40.273
nerves shot,
hand showing signs
of ischemia.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.843
I think
I can save it.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.712
I need
to open up his chest,

10:44.845 --> 10:47.047
get access to proximal vessel
for graft bypass.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.481
That's a big,
lengthy surgery

10:48.615 --> 10:49.950
with a catastrophic
risk of bleeding.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.819
Yeah, which may
save his arm.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.954
He's already lost
too much blood
from his other injuries.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.090
We have to amputate.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.496
Sorry to interrupt.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.099
Dr. Lim, there's major damage
to Elaine's heart valve.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.500
We need
a trauma surgeon.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.604
Go. Dr. Park
can close up
the abdomen.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.874
Put a wound vac
on the arm stump

11:14.007 --> 11:15.608
and run antibiotics
post-op.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.405
What are you doing?

11:48.341 --> 11:50.177
Practicing mindfulness.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.782
I...don't know
what that means.

11:56.116 --> 12:00.353
It helps you let go,
not be self-obsessed,

12:00.487 --> 12:03.223
stressed out,
utterly career-driven.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.158
I still don't understand.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.937
You're being mindful
right now.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.208
By letting go
of your wedding plan.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.376
Being "in the moment"
with Lea.
Oh.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.479
N-No, Lea and I are still
getting married.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.882
We're only
"enjoying the moment" for now.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.884
Good for you.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.786
I suck
at "the moment."

12:34.221 --> 12:35.722
I like making a plan,

12:35.856 --> 12:37.190
having a plan...

12:39.192 --> 12:40.260
Following a plan.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.632
Do you want my apple?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.635
You're acting
very strangely.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.107
Isla's hemoglobin
dropped to nine,

12:54.241 --> 12:55.375
and there's blood
in her chest tube.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.079
Oh. That's not good.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.817
We'll take a few
pictures to find out
where the problem is.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.418
Won't hurt at all.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.587
Then you can
stop the bleeding?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.256
Probably.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.725
But it will likely
require something
that does hurt.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.263
You need to remove that
before the M.R. Angiogram.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.832
No. I can't.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.536
It's a gum wrapper.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.305
My dad gave it to me.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.640
I wanted my birthstone,
sapphire.

13:27.774 --> 13:31.144
But we couldn't afford it.
So my dad made me this.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.579
He called it
a placeholder.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.014
That's really sweet.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.050
An MRI
is a powerful magnet.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.551
It will destroy
your gum-wrapper ring,

13:38.685 --> 13:39.752
and it could
burn your finger.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.590
Promise you won't
lose it?

13:43.723 --> 13:45.058
I promise.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.337
Okay.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.274
She damaged
her aortic valve.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.709
We'll need
to open her up.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.179
CP bypass is generally
not a good chaser
to a brain bleed.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.480
She needs
a functional valve.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.649
You'll need
to figure out a way
to give her one

14:09.782 --> 14:11.184
without turning her
into a vegetable.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.922
I brought you here
for your expertise.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.789
Or would you rather I try
to figure it out for you?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.460
Throwing up your hands
and making someone else

14:20.593 --> 14:22.495
solve the problem
is not leadership.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.764
I'm gonna guess
we're not talking
about a heart valve.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.868
When Ethicure took over,

14:29.002 --> 14:31.604
you just walked out,
headed for Paradise.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.440
I know you were
going through
a rough patch,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.075
but we were going
through it here, too.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.809
And you didn't bother
to step up

14:36.944 --> 14:38.711
until it became
a problem for Shaun.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.681
You want me to apologize
for my commitment to Shaun?
That's not gonna happen.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.651
I would never
ask you to do that.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.487
I just didn't realize
how little the rest of us
matter to you.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.695
I can insert an aortic pump
to support her heart.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.531
That should buy me
some time to fix her valve.

15:01.168 --> 15:04.737
The chest trauma
damaged a branch
of her pulmonary artery.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.239
The bleeding has stopped,

15:06.373 --> 15:07.907
but her artery could
re-bleed at any time.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.642
How do we get to it?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.544
It's surrounded
by vital organs.

15:11.678 --> 15:15.248
Thoracotomy, dissect from
proximal to distal hilum,

15:15.382 --> 15:17.350
isolate the vessel,
and reconstruct the vessel.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.387
That's a big surgery
for a small injury.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.124
It's almost as risky
as a re-rupture.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.026
We need a safer plan.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.502
I don't have one.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.070
I need time
to figure it out.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.471
I'll need to monitor her
around the clock

15:38.605 --> 15:39.973
in case she bleeds again.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.909
Looks like Isla's
getting some QT

15:43.043 --> 15:44.477
with Dr. Murphy
after all.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.383
Are we done?

15:51.384 --> 15:52.752
I'm bored.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.765
Who's your friend?
She's not my friend.
She's my patient.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.234
Isla Liu,
10-year-old female

16:07.367 --> 16:08.935
with a pseudo-aneurysm
of a segmental branch

16:09.069 --> 16:10.403
of the left
pulmonary artery.

16:10.537 --> 16:11.538
I need to monitor her
closely

16:11.671 --> 16:13.306
to make sure she
does not bleed out.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.908
This is my fiancee, Lea.
She's Head of
the I.T. Department.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.910
I need you
to talk to her

16:18.045 --> 16:19.479
while I figure out
how to fix her.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.882
She talks a lot.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.184
I do.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.720
Where's your ring?
He said you were his fiancee.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.990
I proposed to him,

16:31.124 --> 16:35.728
and it was
a spur of the moment
kinda thing, so no ring.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.330
Very modern.
Mm.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.699
I asked out my last boyfriend,
but it didn't work out.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.335
When's your wedding?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.204
We don't have a date.
Did you pick a cake?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.639
My aunt had red velvet.
It was really good.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.242
And her gown was super long.
They call it a train.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.777
Do you have
one of those?

16:50.910 --> 16:53.346
Trains can lead to tripping
and orthopedic injuries.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.615
I don't want a dress
with a train.

16:55.748 --> 17:01.621
You have no cake, no ring,
no dress, and no date?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.456
We have a cake.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.828
Then how are you
his fiancee?

17:08.961 --> 17:12.165
Isn't it just, like,
boyfriend and girlfriend?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.504
What's I.T.?

17:19.106 --> 17:22.609
Well, I.T. stands for
"information technology,"

17:22.742 --> 17:24.844
so I work with
a lot of computers.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.380
Increase the flow to P-eight
and get a CT of her heart.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.082
We need exact
valve measurements.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.551
Got some good news.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.253
I restored blood flow
to Bryan's arm.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.621
You were supposed
to amputate.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.822
I didn't open his chest.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.990
I rebuilt his vessels
from under the clavicle.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.626
Still got
a large tissue defect,

17:39.759 --> 17:41.394
but I can cover that
with a tissue flap.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.596
I know a great neurosurgeon
for the nerve repairs.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.166
More surgery?
He could bleed again.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.367
I can handle that.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.869
And what about
the potential

17:50.002 --> 17:51.504
for post-transfusion
clotting issues?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.240
Removing his arm
is the only way

17:53.373 --> 17:54.641
to guarantee
we save his life.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.876
Losing two limbs
would be devastating.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.780
It's such a high cost to avoid
a relatively small risk.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.415
But it's not small
to that little girl,

18:02.549 --> 18:04.584
whom you could orphan
to serve your own ego.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.854
Pretty harsh assessment,

18:07.987 --> 18:10.923
especially considering
I just rescued you
and our colleagues

18:11.057 --> 18:12.325
from your suicide mission.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.532
You want a medal for finding
your moral compass

18:19.666 --> 18:21.268
at the last
possible moment?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.736
I was there
when it counted.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.942
You did her bidding,
even after the baby died,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.280
and then leveraged
the situation

18:33.413 --> 18:34.914
so you came out in charge.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.084
I am in charge.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.886
I'm saving
this man's arm.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.431
Hmm.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.436
Are you stealing
from children now?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.737
This stuff's been in here

18:57.870 --> 18:59.572
since my first year
of residency.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.742
Aren't you supposed
to be in peer review?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.477
I'm tied up
on this trauma case.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.145
I thought you might want
to sit in on it for me.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.480
Dr. Farber's leading it.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.148
Chair of the Executive Ops
Committee.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.817
If you want to run
a hospital one day...

19:13.085 --> 19:14.421
Gotta go.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.588
But thanks for
thinking of me.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.293
How can I resect
a pseudo-aneurysm

19:20.427 --> 19:22.595
without cutting off blood flow
to the upper lobe?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.465
What about
arterial bypass?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.600
Isla's 10 years old.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.303
The bypassed artery
wouldn't grow with her lungs.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.538
Do you think Lea and I

19:31.671 --> 19:33.039
are just boyfriend
and girlfriend?

19:34.073 --> 19:35.107
No?

19:35.242 --> 19:37.810
Me neither.

19:37.944 --> 19:42.682
But if we're not
planning a wedding,
then what are we doing?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.951
Are we
moving backwards?

19:45.084 --> 19:47.153
Shaun, a wedding
is just a symbol.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.888
A very nice,
very expensive one,

19:49.021 --> 19:52.158
but real stability
comes from committing
to each other every day.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.660
What should I do?

19:55.127 --> 19:58.097
Uh, you and Lea will need
to figure that out.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.368
The older I get,
the less everyone
seems to know.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.304
That's probably true.

20:04.437 --> 20:09.676
Oh, have you considered
an endovascular embolization
for Isla's pseudo-aneurysm?

20:09.809 --> 20:13.012
Your medical advice
is much better
than your personal advice.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.185
Self-retaining retractor.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.222
Stay out of
my nerve field,
please.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.325
I need
better vessel exposure.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.659
This muscle needs a nerve.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.232
I feel bad about
closing the clinic,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.269
but we can't help anyone

20:36.403 --> 20:37.604
if we can't keep
the lights on.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.005
It's not about
helping anyone.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.708
It's about making sure
you can put your feet up

20:41.841 --> 20:44.243
on the biggest desk
in the building.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.346
You look down on me
'cause I want the big job,

20:47.980 --> 20:50.216
but it was your
apathy towards it
that made us vulnerable

20:50.350 --> 20:51.684
to Ethicure
in the first place.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.754
Nerves are attached.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.757
Reconstructed vessel's
blown.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.992
You want me to...
No, I got it.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.097
The embolization
will be short.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.800
It should prevent further
bleeding in your chest.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.802
Dr. Park thinks
you're wrong.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.604
Lea is still my fiancee

21:11.738 --> 21:13.606
and a wedding
is just a symbol.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.208
Symbols are
a super big deal.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.577
They remind us
what's important.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.447
That's what my mom said
when I wanted

21:20.580 --> 21:22.715
to return
my confirmation cross

21:22.849 --> 21:24.584
and use the money
to get my ears pierced.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.087
Lie down.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.456
I need to inject
the anesthetic.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.858
I hate needles.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.727
I still make my mom
hold my hand
when I get shots.

21:40.232 --> 21:43.403
You can squeeze my hand
as hard as you want.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.373
I practiced when Lea
was pregnant.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.475
You two have a baby?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.480
No.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.814
Why not?

22:01.588 --> 22:04.156
There was a clot
in the umbilical cord.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.492
The baby died.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.139
I'm injecting
the anesthetic.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.155
You can let go
of my hand now.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.359
That hardly hurt
at all.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.161
You're very good
at your job.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.801
Isla, the doctors are still
taking care of your mom,

22:48.935 --> 22:50.803
but your dad's
out of surgery.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.041
He lost his leg,

22:56.275 --> 22:59.011
but he's gonna
be okay.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.047
You can see him as soon
as you're done.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.519
I don't want
to see him.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.329
Fluid's backed up
in Elaine's brain.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.468
75 mannitol.
Hopefully, that'll
take the pressure off.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.939
Elaine needs a shunt.
Can her heart take it?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.775
Not with just a pump
keeping her alive,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.376
but she's got
another problem.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.744
She's got a big tear
in her trachea

23:31.878 --> 23:33.345
and she could lose
her airway any minute.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.584
Know of any experts
in tracheal reconstruction?

23:37.717 --> 23:40.019
Time to call
the President.

23:42.855 --> 23:43.990
This is Donald Adler.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.725
He's had chest pain
for the past few weeks.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.059
I'm fine.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.028
My son's taking me
to the doctor.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.263
The one who's postponed
three times already?

23:51.397 --> 23:53.833
I tried to contact his GP.
No luck.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.768
We need to rule out
coronary artery disease.

23:55.902 --> 23:56.869
Is he your patient?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.973
She's my chess partner
at the home.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.942
I beat her
three times in a row.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.244
Impressive.
She always kicks my ass.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.679
He's much better
than you are.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.081
How long
is this gonna take?

24:09.215 --> 24:10.750
We're having
arts and crafts
tonight.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.885
She's teaching us
how to decoupage.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.823
Let's, uh,
get you a cardiac CT.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.558
Help Mr. Adler
into a gown.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.966
You look a lot like
my girlfriend,

24:27.099 --> 24:28.601
but she doesn't
decoupage.

24:28.735 --> 24:32.004
She mocks people
who decoupage.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.606
Well, she sounds like
a real piece of work.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.979
Hey. I got this for Isla.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.114
How is she?
Hello.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.983
I'm waiting on labs to see
if the embolization

24:44.116 --> 24:46.252
repaired the artery
in her chest.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.920
I meant emotionally.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.657
She's refusing
to see her father.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.924
We don't know why.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.127
Well, shouldn't
you find out?

24:55.261 --> 24:58.531
I am waiting on labs.
Jordan is talking to her.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.932
I think we should
pick a date

25:00.066 --> 25:01.801
for when we're going
to start planning
our wedding again.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.537
June 8th?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.806
What happened to
enjoying the moment?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.643
I'm not enjoying it.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.679
Okay.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.446
We had a plan.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.949
Now, we don't have a plan,

25:17.083 --> 25:19.351
and you're okay with that,
but I'm not.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.020
We will figure it out,
Shaunie.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.823
How?

25:24.791 --> 25:25.792
I don't know yet.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.828
No one has
good advice anymore.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.963
Isla's not talking to me.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.466
We should page
the social worker.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.469
She's not going to open up
to the social worker, Shaun.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.874
Isla trusts you.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.351
I can use
a transcervical approach

25:52.484 --> 25:53.786
to reconstruct
the airway.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.321
If you use a retractor
in her neck,

25:55.454 --> 25:56.989
I'll lose drainage
from her brain.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.190
I need to start her
on heparin

25:58.324 --> 25:59.626
so I can get working
on her heart.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.161
You can't use heparin
until I've placed the shunt.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.596
Not while
I'm working on her neck.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.497
One wrong move,
she'll need
a lifelong trach.

26:05.632 --> 26:06.999
If she bleeds again
from her sagittal sinus,

26:07.133 --> 26:08.500
she'll be brain dead.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.870
If she has
catastrophic heart failure,
she'll be dead-dead.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.405
Okay.
Airway's priority one.

26:13.539 --> 26:15.942
Once it's secure,
you can fix the valve.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.877
You're overruling
my judgment again?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.378
Overruling? We...

26:19.511 --> 26:20.913
Elaine's pump failed.
She's in total heart failure.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.248
I'm prepping an O.R.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.821
Mm.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.096
That is a very accurate
drawing of a horse.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.032
It's my dog, Abigail.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.334
Oh.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.038
She must
look like a horse.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.050
Is my dad
in a lot of pain?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.052
No.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.454
He is on
very strong narcotics.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.056
Why don't you
want to see him?

27:08.360 --> 27:11.798
His residual limb
is heavily bandaged,

27:11.931 --> 27:13.866
so you won't be able
to see any...

27:14.000 --> 27:17.770
Blood or tissue
or bones.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.271
I'm not afraid of that.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.144
Okay.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.328
I was kicking
the back of the seat.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.598
The driver's seat,
which my dad hates.

27:48.434 --> 27:52.471
He missed my choir concert,
which made me mad,

27:52.604 --> 27:53.773
so I kicked his seat.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.976
And he told me to stop,

27:57.109 --> 27:59.478
but I kept kicking
and kicking,

28:00.913 --> 28:02.815
and then he turned around,

28:02.949 --> 28:04.316
told me to cut it out,

28:06.953 --> 28:08.788
and then I heard
Mom scream,

28:10.089 --> 28:13.125
and there were sirens,
and then we were here.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.928
He's going to hate me

28:16.062 --> 28:19.331
because I'm selfish and stupid
and it was all my fault.

28:29.675 --> 28:31.878
It was...

28:32.011 --> 28:35.147
My fault
my brother Steve died.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.355
But it was
Steve's fault, too.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.458
It was his idea to hide
on the roof of the train.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.664
He fell.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.167
He broke his neck.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.541
Your dad took his eyes
off the road,

29:04.343 --> 29:07.046
and a car ran a red light
and the airbags didn't deploy.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.547
Those things
are not your fault.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.019
And even if it were...

29:16.155 --> 29:18.190
Your parents would
probably still love you,

29:20.893 --> 29:23.195
because of your shared
experience in combination

29:23.329 --> 29:25.865
with the parental
bonding hormone oxytocin.

29:29.701 --> 29:33.605
Although, in my case,
it wasn't enough.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.477
My parents
didn't like me.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.215
I'm sorry
about your brother.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.218
And your parents.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.287
And your baby.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.224
You've had
a lot of bad things
happen to you.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.599
I've had
a lot of good things
happen, too.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.508
Okay.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.143
I want to go see my dad.

30:16.582 --> 30:17.449
Aah.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.385
Isla?

30:22.788 --> 30:25.757
I need a rapid response team,
stat.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.426
She's bleeding
in her chest!

30:33.933 --> 30:36.168
BP is 65 over palp.
Give another
unit of blood.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.637
We have to
open her up, Shaun.

30:38.770 --> 30:39.838
We could
injure her bronchi

30:39.972 --> 30:41.207
and cause
chronic respiratory failure

30:41.340 --> 30:42.674
or rupture her
pulmonary artery.

30:42.808 --> 30:43.976
She could bleed out.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.277
If we don't operate now,
she's gonna die.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.616
Prep an O.R.
for stat thoracotomy,
and page Dr. Lim.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.325
The old fart
needs angioplasty and a stent.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.293
You may have just saved
this guy's life.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.664
I'm gonna be late
for arts and crafts.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.299
Does this have anything
to do with Nira?

31:09.135 --> 31:11.470
Hey, you made one bad call.
You're not a bad person.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.006
Uh, that is not what
you said last week.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.374
I may have overreacted.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.312
I've woken up
every morning
my whole life

31:20.446 --> 31:23.815
wanting to conquer the world,
and then I hurt someone,

31:23.950 --> 31:25.184
and I almost lost...

31:27.319 --> 31:28.754
I almost lost everything.

31:30.356 --> 31:34.693
So now,
I am going to cultivate
virtuous intentions

31:34.826 --> 31:38.464
and...generally
not be so awful.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.666
If you want to meditate
and volunteer

31:40.799 --> 31:43.402
and save random old guys,
go ahead.

31:43.535 --> 31:46.505
But don't become
a totally different person.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.341
I would miss you.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.079
The world needs people
who wake up every morning

31:53.212 --> 31:55.181
wanting to conquer it.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.049
Those kinds of people
land on the moon

31:57.183 --> 31:59.351
and cure cancer and...

32:00.852 --> 32:03.389
Drag grumpy, old men
into the E.R.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.857
And trample innocent souls
along the way.

32:05.992 --> 32:06.825
Yeah, don't do that part.

32:10.196 --> 32:11.697
I'll be around
to remind you.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.636
I'll prep a suite
for Old Fart.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.879
Take much longer and she'll
have a cardiac arrest.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.983
Trach is secure.
Go ahead.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.387
Advancing the catheter
to the ascending aorta.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.625
Bring down her CO2.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.762
Retract the neck muscles
so there's...

32:43.895 --> 32:44.763
Yeah, no, I got it.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.408
The death of that baby
kept me up at night.

32:58.910 --> 32:59.778
It still does.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.915
I should have
taken a stand then,

33:05.717 --> 33:07.486
but Salen told me
it kept her up at night, too.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.222
She promised
to make changes

33:10.356 --> 33:11.923
to ensure that
it never would
happen again,

33:13.725 --> 33:16.695
and I believed her
because I cared for her.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.498
A lot.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.103
But my eyes were closed,

33:25.771 --> 33:27.506
and I should have
stepped up sooner.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.643
Because this place
is my home,

33:33.112 --> 33:36.882
and you pains-in-the-ass
are my family.

33:40.386 --> 33:44.156
Together, we can fix
this woman's heart,

33:44.290 --> 33:46.325
her brain, and neck.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.462
We can do great things
for all our patients...

33:53.599 --> 33:54.700
If we don't
kill each other first.

34:00.672 --> 34:01.840
Shunt's through.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.475
You can go ahead
with the trach repair.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.481
She's crashing.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.660
Dr. Cain will be here
in 20 minutes.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.363
We don't have
20 minutes.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.237
I have to
open her chest now.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.739
Get an attending
out of surgery.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.151
She has
critical bradycardia,

34:45.284 --> 34:46.685
but the valve
is well-positioned.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.521
Drain two cc's of CSF
every minute.

34:50.822 --> 34:51.890
That should buy me
ten minutes.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.427
I'll remove
the delivery valve.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.528
I'll put in
a temporary pacer.

34:59.064 --> 35:00.766
But I still don't know
what's tanking her heart rate.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.868
I do.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.870
The tracheal injury
compressed her carotid.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.071
It's lowering
her heart rate.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.843
Try removing
the retractor.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.512
Push atropine.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.750
No good.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.519
Heart rate's in the 30s.
She's gonna arrest.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.954
Gonna try to decompress
the carotid bulb.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.556
Shaun needs one of you
in O.R. three.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.925
Isla's
pulmonary vessel ruptured.
He's cracking her chest.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.466
I need ten minutes.
Tell Shaun to use every
bit of his Shaun-ness

35:34.600 --> 35:35.834
to keep her alive
till I get there.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.745
Andrews can be here
in ten minutes.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.714
I've located
the bleeding vessel.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.756
If I clamp too close
to the pulmonary artery,

35:57.889 --> 36:00.426
I'll extend the injury
and she will bleed out.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.093
If I get too close
to the hilum,

36:02.228 --> 36:03.995
I could cause
a pulmonary infarct.

36:04.129 --> 36:05.664
She'd need a ventilator
for the rest of her life.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.169
I need Andrews' help.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.972
She's going into shock.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.474
You can do this, Shaun.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.353
I need Metz, stay sutures,
and a needle driver.

36:35.627 --> 36:36.962
BP's climbing.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.641
Well done, Dr. Murphy.
Want me to take over?

36:51.277 --> 36:53.044
Yes.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.665
We're all going to be okay.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.035
Except for
the severe chest pain

37:17.168 --> 37:19.405
you will both experience
for several weeks.

37:19.538 --> 37:23.409
And there is a 1% chance of
a recurrent pseudo-aneurysm.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.378
But yes, you will
most likely be okay.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.048
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.352
We'll give you all
some time.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.891
I didn't lose it.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.276
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

38:28.574 --> 38:31.943
Personal connections
aren't so bad, are they?

38:34.245 --> 38:36.281
Mm. No.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.783
They are not so bad.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.253
But I do not
want to do it again.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.757
I have to go home.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.762
I think I can
save the clinic.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.465
Dr. Reznick,
it's been a long day.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.767
I talk fast.
Old people.

38:55.901 --> 38:56.968
They need care the most

38:57.102 --> 38:58.670
and they have
the least access.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.139
Telemedicine services
for nursing homes.

39:01.272 --> 39:04.376
I just brought in a patient
who needed a $100,000 angio,

39:04.510 --> 39:06.378
entirely paid for
by Medicare.

39:06.512 --> 39:07.679
That alone would
cover the cost

39:07.813 --> 39:09.448
of three uninsured
clinic patients.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.986
It's a good idea, but ideas
aren't your problem.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.690
I know.
I made a mistake...

39:18.824 --> 39:21.326
And followed it up
with another.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.529
You've bungled
your opportunity
from every direction.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.796
I know.

39:26.465 --> 39:30.502
Which is why
Dr. Glassman should
be in charge of the clinic.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.871
I'm not ready,
but I will be.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.205
Someday.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.641
And you're gonna need
people like me

39:35.774 --> 39:36.875
if you're gonna
save this place.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.346
And you know I'm right,

39:41.480 --> 39:42.748
because you wake up
every morning

39:42.881 --> 39:44.716
wanting to
conquer the world, too.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.613
What is all of this?

40:14.746 --> 40:16.214
I got you something.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.423
I made it myself.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.135
Lea Dilallo...

40:39.505 --> 40:42.073
...will you

40:42.207 --> 40:46.878
make a bond
of shared experience
and oxytocin...

40:49.548 --> 40:53.885
...and love with me
for the rest of our lives?

40:57.088 --> 40:58.524
Of course.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.239
It's a placeholder.

41:14.372 --> 41:16.341
It's perfect.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.499
I left a bottle of Scotch
around here somewhere

41:41.633 --> 41:43.535
after the first time
you stole my job.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.639
Did you drink
all my fizzy water?

41:47.773 --> 41:50.642
There's a cucumber one
left in the back.
They're disgusting.

41:50.776 --> 41:52.678
It's refreshing
and delicious.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.412
Agree to disagree.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.014
Yep.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.482
Found it.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.253
Why not?
