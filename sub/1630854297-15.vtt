WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.350
* *

00:08.550 --> 00:10.820
Guy runs one of the
biggest cartels in Mexico.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.230
Gets to be flown in
on a private jet.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.700
BAEZ:
Well, soon he'll be cooling
his jets in a federal prison.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.000
That's assuming we can
get him to his arraignment.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.700
(sighs)
Zaragoza Cartel

00:20.900 --> 00:23.540
has broken him out of two
different prisons in Mexico.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.000
That's why we're gonna
make him disappear

00:25.200 --> 00:27.620
until we walk him
into that courthouse.

00:31.790 --> 00:32.930
(sighs)

00:34.700 --> 00:36.450
BAEZ: Rodriguez is even
better-looking in person.

00:36.650 --> 00:38.770
A lot of bodies
behind that smile.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.550
BAEZ:
You know, getting him
to court could get hairy,

00:41.750 --> 00:43.560
you sure I can't tag along?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.460
Trust me, I'd rather
ride along with you

00:45.660 --> 00:47.460
than a bunch of Feds.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.500
Task force leader
wants it this way.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.010
Well, maybe I can
change his mind.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.750
You could try.
He's pretty stubborn.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.910
Thought you were gonna
bring me a hat.

01:04.110 --> 01:05.940
If we deliver this prisoner
without getting killed,

01:06.150 --> 01:06.980
I'll think about it.

01:07.180 --> 01:08.430
Sounds like a deal.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.120
Everything I've loved
and worked toward

01:11.320 --> 01:13.670
is gonna be destroyed
just because of a lie.

01:14.470 --> 01:18.110
Look, I-I'm not the monster that
they're making me out to be.

01:21.010 --> 01:24.700
Scott is a beloved brother
and son.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.230
A D1 athlete with a perfect GPA

01:27.430 --> 01:30.170
who devotes his limited free
time to helping the community.

01:30.370 --> 01:32.740
Do you think the rape
allegations will hinder Scott's

01:32.940 --> 01:34.510
chances of going
to the NBA?
Not one bit.

01:34.710 --> 01:37.240
Those allegations are
nonsensical, defamatory,

01:37.440 --> 01:38.480
and flat-out false.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.350
Are you saying the state
has no case?

01:40.550 --> 01:42.420
I'm saying that Erin Reagan,
the prosecutor,

01:42.620 --> 01:43.880
has all but filed the paperwork

01:44.080 --> 01:46.190
for her run for
Manhattan District Attorney.

01:46.390 --> 01:47.550
Let's just say
this outrageous charge

01:47.750 --> 01:50.060
has been influenced
by her career ambitions.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.690
REPORTER: Do you think
this case may hurt--

01:51.890 --> 01:53.630
You called an urgent
meeting for this?

01:53.830 --> 01:56.130
Lisa Reynolds is tossing
your name around like a salad.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.360
It's part of the job.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.530
She's a big shot
sports agent.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.070
And that's supposed
to scare me?

02:01.270 --> 02:03.670
And before that, she was an
even bigger defense attorney.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.800
I've seen her make people
in this office cry.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.740
Well, she hasn't
gone up against me.

02:07.940 --> 02:09.340
So you're not even
a little worried

02:09.540 --> 02:11.210
that she's playing this case
out in the press?

02:11.410 --> 02:14.550
And trying it in the court
of public opinion?
Exactly.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.720
Scott Taylor raped
Shayla Alexander.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.420
The only thing
I'm concerned about

02:19.620 --> 02:21.570
is getting justice
for his victim.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.220
(sighs)

02:24.420 --> 02:25.720
Human trafficking ring
we're targeting

02:25.920 --> 02:27.930
is active up and down
the East Coast.

02:28.130 --> 02:29.430
The Feds requested
our assistance

02:29.630 --> 02:30.860
taking down the
New York operation.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.030
Doesn't get much
worse than this.

02:33.230 --> 02:34.830
Yeah, they prey on kids
as young as ten.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.170
FLEMING:
The ring lures its victims
into sex trafficking

02:37.370 --> 02:39.710
through a combination
of targeted grooming

02:39.910 --> 02:41.610
and coerced drug dependency.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.280
Hell of a body count, too.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.710
And all of
'em minors.

02:44.910 --> 02:47.880
Except for the two dead
Carolina state troopers.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.080
They were adults,
with wives and kids.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.720
And that was a tragedy, sir.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.210
But one which we had no part of
in planning or execution.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.740
I understand.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.030
So, what's the game plan?

03:04.230 --> 03:05.430
Infiltrate the ring

03:05.630 --> 03:07.470
by placing an undercover officer
on the inside,

03:07.670 --> 03:09.740
catch them in the act
of recruiting these kids.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.590
Who's going undercover?

03:12.620 --> 03:13.810
That's Sergeant Reagan.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.620
He designed the operation.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.480
Well, first of all, clearly
you've done your homework.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.490
And it does seem to be
a can of worms

03:29.690 --> 03:31.940
you'd like to open
from the inside.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.360
But that said,
I think it would be wise

03:38.560 --> 03:41.550
to lead with our best punch.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.940
Sir?

03:45.140 --> 03:48.040
Well, the Vice Unit's
Human Trafficking Team

03:48.240 --> 03:52.330
has deep experience
in cases like this.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.570
I would like to hand it off
to them.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.490
All due respect...

04:01.690 --> 04:04.860
this ring's been operating
in the city for over a year.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.590
Vice hasn't been able
to crack it. I think we can.

04:07.790 --> 04:11.660
Well, not this time.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.650
That is all, Lieutenant.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.230
(door closes)

04:30.870 --> 04:32.420
Have you seriously never
watched <i>Romance Island?</i>

04:32.620 --> 04:34.090
Are you seriously
telling me that you do?

04:34.290 --> 04:36.560
20 eligible bachelors
vying for the attention

04:36.760 --> 04:38.560
of three women,
on an island.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.540
It's a masterpiece.
Officer Janko.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.230
Do I know you?
Well, you should.

04:44.430 --> 04:46.980
Ten months ago,
you told me my son was dead.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.230
I'm sorry--

04:49.440 --> 04:50.890
Don't you dare say that.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.670
Come on, Naomi.

04:52.870 --> 04:53.870
Calm down.
Don't tell me

04:54.070 --> 04:55.340
to calm down!
You lied to me!

04:55.540 --> 04:58.010
I...
You told me they would
find Jamal's killer.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.730
And today his death
is officially a cold case!

05:04.000 --> 05:05.330
You lied.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.090
FRANKLIN:
Come on.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.360
Naomi.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.740
I'll see you out.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.580
FELTON:
You okay?

05:20.180 --> 05:23.250
* *

05:43.140 --> 05:44.470
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>How was the flight?</i>

05:45.270 --> 05:47.160
Very pleasant.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.560
I wasn't talking to you.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.130
Once we cleared the airport
of cartel assassins,

05:51.330 --> 05:52.670
we got away fine.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.700
That airport was the least
of your problems, Major.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.270
DANNY: Well,
you're looking at life.

05:56.470 --> 05:59.270
So I'd say you're the one
with the problems.

05:59.470 --> 06:01.340
I hoped I'd finally get
to meet you, Detective.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.690
My condolences on
the loss of your wife.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.530
I think you should keep my
wife's name out of your mouth.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.490
La Mano Sangrienta is
a violent organization.

06:13.690 --> 06:16.320
And the Zaragozas are
regular pacifists.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.590
Except for their
murder, kidnapping,

06:18.790 --> 06:20.330
drug smuggling,
money laundering...

06:20.530 --> 06:22.400
I'm a businessman.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.900
My associates have a vested
interest in my liberation.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.100
Your associates are gonna be
very disappointed, then.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.250
I admire your confidence.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.320
* *

06:34.090 --> 06:35.820
(engines revving)

06:45.970 --> 06:47.290
We've got company.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.260
(chuckles)
Let the games begin.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.680
Shut your mouth.

07:00.350 --> 07:01.230
You ready?

07:01.430 --> 07:02.790
Yeah.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.420
Pull into the underpass.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.530
(engines revving)

07:14.600 --> 07:16.000
(man speaking Spanish)

07:28.180 --> 07:29.060
Let's go.

07:29.260 --> 07:31.350
What the hell is this?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.270
We picked up chatter
your associates

07:33.470 --> 07:34.650
were tracking
your arrival.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.640
They want to play
follow the leader?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.660
That's just what
they're gonna do.

07:44.490 --> 07:45.860
Pull your hat down.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.030
That's how we wear 'em
back home.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.450
Take them to the
designated location

07:51.650 --> 07:53.320
and take them down.
You got it.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.120
The games have begun.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.570
Your ass is losing.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.680
(engine starts)

08:04.380 --> 08:07.580
* *

08:09.050 --> 08:11.040
(door opens)

08:11.240 --> 08:12.300
GORMELY:
I checked it out.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.440
Vice has had eyes
on this trafficking ring

08:14.640 --> 08:15.540
for 15 months.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.440
I didn't doubt Jamie's intel.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.340
Yet they're still active.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.410
And what did Vice have to say?

08:21.610 --> 08:23.830
They said they're
hard at work on it.

08:25.570 --> 08:26.720
What do you doubt?

08:26.920 --> 08:28.750
You say you don't doubt
Jamie's intel...

08:28.950 --> 08:30.620
Right now...

08:30.820 --> 08:33.480
the wisdom of them
taking this on.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.330
Fleming ask you
to plead his case?

08:36.530 --> 08:37.960
He did.
(chuckles) Yeah.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.000
And I agreed because I think
his people would do a great job.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.330
They would.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.200
But there are
other considerations.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
Like what?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.540
Like two dead state troopers.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.830
Well, that's more
the reason to push.
Sid.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.480
Those troopers weren't
just killed.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.570
They were tortured
and buried alive.

08:59.870 --> 09:00.620
Wow...

09:00.820 --> 09:02.820
Fleming mention that?

09:03.020 --> 09:03.890
No.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.390
But I don't know
if I would either

09:05.590 --> 09:07.060
if it was me trying
to get the green light.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.890
I think you would, Sid.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.230
They're bad guys, boss.

09:10.430 --> 09:11.500
That's all I need to know.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.030
Look, Fleming's great
at what he does.

09:14.230 --> 09:17.100
He gets hard, fast results,
while other people get...

09:17.300 --> 09:18.300
caught in the weeds.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.840
Well, that's a good thing.
Yes, but

09:20.040 --> 09:22.470
that takes a certain gift
for tunnel vision

09:22.680 --> 09:25.890
with little appetite
for risk assessment.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.380
That's why you still
want Vice for this?

09:29.580 --> 09:31.380
You don't want to see
your son go undercover

09:31.580 --> 09:33.570
with animals like that?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.990
My son...

09:37.190 --> 09:38.870
or anybody else.

09:40.210 --> 09:44.260
No, we go at them with numbers
across the battlefield,

09:44.460 --> 09:46.530
not behind enemy lines.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.270
And Vice has the numbers.

09:48.470 --> 09:49.700
And the chops.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.840
It's gonna take a lot longer
that way, boss.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.070
Yeah, but...

09:55.270 --> 09:58.790
at least more of ours
will come home safe.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.020
(sighs)

10:03.220 --> 10:06.920
Detectives, can I ask you a few
questions about Jamal Wilson?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.820
Naomi Wilson sure
gave you an earful.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.560
I guess we have you to blame
for promising her an arrest.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.260
That's not an unreasonable
expectation.

10:14.460 --> 10:15.960
It is when the vic is a perp.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.530
I've seen the rap sheet.

10:17.730 --> 10:18.960
Then you know
that it was a mile long.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.030
So his criminal history
means that his...

10:21.230 --> 10:22.900
killer gets a free pass?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.170
No. (scoffs)

10:24.370 --> 10:26.440
Despite what Naomi
thinks, we did our best.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.670
We canvassed the area,

10:27.870 --> 10:29.540
but people weren't
excited to talk to us.

10:29.740 --> 10:30.840
Ten months is a short time

10:31.040 --> 10:32.580
to call a case cold.
Not when you've got

10:32.780 --> 10:34.380
at least ten other murders
within that time frame.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.410
FRANKLIN: Because the, uh,
seven-year-old gunshot victim,

10:36.610 --> 10:38.780
the woman who was
killed by her ex,

10:38.980 --> 10:40.020
man who caught
a stray bullet

10:40.220 --> 10:41.350
in front of his 12-year-old--
I get it.

10:41.550 --> 10:42.720
People are killed every day.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.820
Most of them innocent.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.190
And every day we have to decide

10:45.390 --> 10:46.690
which cases we prioritize.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.980
A drug dealer shot in the back
wasn't a priority.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.600
This way.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.700
Love what you've
done with the place.
Yeah.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.240
Well, too bad it's not one
of your fancy drug cribs.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.110
Sit down.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.880
RODRIGUEZ:
I lived in a sewer
for three weeks

11:03.080 --> 11:04.610
the first time
I escaped.

11:04.810 --> 11:06.210
Right where you belong.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.400
Mm.
(radio chatter)

11:09.300 --> 11:11.820
Just arrested your compadres who
followed us from the airport.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.390
Plenty more
where they came from.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.690
DANNY:
Good.

11:15.890 --> 11:16.860
They'll end up
the same way you are.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.190
RODRIGUQEZ: And some
of mine will die

11:18.390 --> 11:19.960
and some of yours
will die.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.460
So unnecessary.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.500
Then call off your dogs
and stand trial like a man.

11:23.700 --> 11:24.760
I'm El Granjero.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.400
I made my partners rich.
They need me.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.900
What's an El Granjero?

11:29.100 --> 11:30.640
"The Farmer."

11:30.840 --> 11:32.240
RODRIGUEZ: My father
owned a small piece

11:32.440 --> 11:33.910
of land in Zaragoza.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.510
The Droguistas ordered him
to grow for them.

11:36.710 --> 11:37.640
He refused.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.180
Too bad you
didn't try that.

11:40.380 --> 11:41.510
(chuckles)

11:41.710 --> 11:44.130
They cut off his hand
with a machete.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.490
That's when I decided I'd be
the one holding the knife.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.090
Could've gone another way.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.360
Mm-hmm.
In my village,
there was only one

11:51.560 --> 11:53.660
road to a better life,

11:53.860 --> 11:56.700
leading from our fields
to your streets.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.230
Well, sadly,
that road ends here.

11:59.430 --> 12:01.020
It doesn't have to.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.100
No?
Mm-mm.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.100
Hmm.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.590
What do you have in mind?

12:11.930 --> 12:13.950
I walk out that door,

12:14.150 --> 12:18.070
in exchange for $10 million,
apiece.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.490
I always wanted to buy a ranch.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.420
Breed quarter horses.
Mm.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.690
That sounds nice.

12:26.890 --> 12:29.230
How about you, Detective?
I'd love a boat.

12:29.430 --> 12:30.700
Maybe even one for my dad.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.630
You know, like, a
real fishing boat?

12:32.830 --> 12:35.670
Couple of twin
1,800-horsepower engines.

12:35.870 --> 12:37.270
Probably gonna need a crew, too.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.590
Yeah, definitely need a crew.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.640
Or...

12:41.840 --> 12:44.080
we can add bribery
of federal officers

12:44.280 --> 12:45.480
to your list of felonies.

12:45.680 --> 12:50.250
RODRIGUEZ: In exchange for
$10 million, apiece.

12:50.450 --> 12:52.070
Yeah, there is that.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.490
Your loss.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.020
DANNY: Would've
been nice.

12:57.220 --> 12:59.260
Love those ponies.
DANNY: Yeah.

12:59.460 --> 13:00.960
Oh, well.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.850
Sit down.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.700
I-I don't usually go to parties.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.130
But I'm a senior,

13:09.330 --> 13:11.740
and this was my last
Halloween weekend.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.170
So when Scott
invited me out,

13:14.370 --> 13:18.160
I felt like it was
my last chance to just...

13:19.130 --> 13:21.280
...be a normal college kid.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.320
And this is Scott Taylor?

13:23.520 --> 13:25.000
Yeah.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.820
When I got there,

13:28.020 --> 13:29.590
he gave me a jungle juice.

13:29.790 --> 13:32.560
And the last thing I remember

13:32.760 --> 13:34.430
was someone...

13:34.630 --> 13:36.160
overpowering me.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.810
And can you point out
your attacker?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.370
SHAYLA:
I can't.

13:44.570 --> 13:45.470
I can't.

13:45.670 --> 13:47.090
(hushed chatter)

13:48.960 --> 13:49.810
(gavel bangs)
JUDGE: Order.

13:50.010 --> 13:50.840
ERIN:
It's okay.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.150
Do you need to compose yourself?

13:53.350 --> 13:54.480
No.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.180
I don't know who attacked me.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.320
(more hushed chatter)

13:59.520 --> 14:01.150
(gavel bangs)
Order!

14:01.350 --> 14:03.120
ERIN: Shayla,
you understand

14:03.320 --> 14:06.360
there are serious repercussions
for lying on the stand?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.830
Um...

14:08.030 --> 14:11.300
You gave a statement
that Scott Taylor

14:11.500 --> 14:12.660
raped you.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.530
I don't know who raped me.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.920
(gallery whispering)

14:23.890 --> 14:26.960
My grandfather got me into
the Westerns when I was a kid.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.680
GATES: The Duke's
always cool, but

14:30.880 --> 14:34.050
Dean Martin in the Old West
is kind of pushing things.
Yeah.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.150
But Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda...

14:36.350 --> 14:39.060
I mean, those guys made me want
to grow up and become a cowboy.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.660
So what happened?

14:40.860 --> 14:41.930
I'm from Brooklyn.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.460
I'm scared of horses.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.260
Seriously?
Yeah.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.800
People are hell of a lot
scarier than horses.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.430
That's true, but I'd rather
have a Ford Mustang

14:49.630 --> 14:51.450
than a real mustang any day.

14:52.590 --> 14:53.540
(window opening)

14:53.740 --> 14:55.920
* *

15:00.730 --> 15:01.710
Police!

15:01.910 --> 15:03.100
Don't move!

15:14.240 --> 15:15.310
Ah!

15:18.680 --> 15:20.330
It's time to go.

15:20.530 --> 15:23.290
This location's compromised.
We're on the move.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.060
Come on.

15:35.930 --> 15:37.970
* *

15:39.000 --> 15:40.720
Yep, okay.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.320
Rodriguez is tucked away
in a safehouse in Queens.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.390
Question is
how long it'll be safe.

15:45.590 --> 15:46.720
Well, nobody came or went

15:46.920 --> 15:48.490
from the first location
after we arrived.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.000
So no one was followed.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.700
Unless they didn't have to be.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.000
Meaning...?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.430
Meaning it's possible
one of your people

15:54.630 --> 15:55.970
is playing for the other team.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.940
You think the cartel has
someone inside the task force?

15:59.140 --> 16:01.270
Pretty tough to turn your nose
up at $10 million.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.910
Might explain how
they tracked us down.

16:04.110 --> 16:05.540
Every member of this group

16:05.740 --> 16:07.780
has been carefully vetted.

16:07.980 --> 16:10.550
Yes, which is an inexact
science, as you well know.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.190
Come on, a well-trained agent
can cover their tracks.

16:13.390 --> 16:17.060
There's a classified file on
every member of the task force.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.220
I'm suggesting we take a look
at every single one of them

16:19.420 --> 16:21.440
who knew Rodriguez's location.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.850
I hope you're wrong.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.510
Me, too.

16:29.650 --> 16:30.640
Hey.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.620
Uh, what's your
take on, um...

16:35.520 --> 16:37.240
...Detectives Franklin
and Ricci?

16:37.440 --> 16:39.180
They're solid detectives.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.110
A little old-school
for my taste.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.750
Something tells me that wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

16:43.950 --> 16:46.450
I got this case ten month ago
and then it went cold.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.220
You don't sound convinced.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.550
It's a short time
to give up.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.020
No one said
they gave up.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.320
But face it,

16:52.520 --> 16:53.890
ten months might as well
be ten years

16:54.090 --> 16:56.430
without leads, evidence
or witnesses.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.530
The victim was a drug dealer.

16:58.730 --> 16:59.830
And?

17:00.030 --> 17:03.050
And maybe the detectives
didn't look hard enough.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.570
Case wasn't prioritized.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.470
I and everyone
in this department

17:07.670 --> 17:08.770
would've done the same thing.

17:08.970 --> 17:11.660
My husband
said that, too.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.210
We're supposed to...

17:14.410 --> 17:16.760
serve the community.
We do.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.750
Did you ask because
you wanted my honest opinion

17:20.950 --> 17:22.620
or because you thought
I would feel differently

17:22.820 --> 17:24.770
because the victim
and I are Black?

17:26.070 --> 17:27.840
Both.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.100
What that woman...
Naomi.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.630
...is going through is horrible.

17:35.830 --> 17:39.570
But finding a killer
on any case is tough work.

17:39.770 --> 17:41.010
Finding one ten months later

17:41.210 --> 17:43.780
is like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.530
So why don't we?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.380
Find the needle.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.600
* *

17:54.170 --> 17:56.470
What happened yesterday?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.560
I'm sorry.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.530
That's all you have to say
for lying on the stand?

18:03.730 --> 18:07.070
All my life, I've dreamed
about working in the NBA.

18:07.270 --> 18:08.700
And then
this happened and...

18:08.900 --> 18:10.540
all my job offers were gone.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.070
I can go after you for perjury.

18:13.270 --> 18:15.940
That would mean time
in a state prison.

18:16.140 --> 18:16.970
What? Prison?

18:17.180 --> 18:18.540
Yeah.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.680
ABETEMARCO:
And at that point,
you could kiss

18:19.880 --> 18:20.750
your dream
career goodbye.

18:20.950 --> 18:23.080
I'm sure the NBA has a policy

18:23.280 --> 18:24.650
against hiring felons.

18:24.850 --> 18:25.680
They said if I said I don't know

18:25.880 --> 18:26.980
that all this would go away.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.570
Who told you that?

18:29.570 --> 18:30.460
Lisa said...

18:30.660 --> 18:32.520
if I identified Scott,

18:32.720 --> 18:35.140
I'd lose everything.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.360
ABETEMARCO:
His agent?
Lisa Reynolds...

18:38.560 --> 18:39.730
spoke to you?

18:39.930 --> 18:40.800
Yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.300
ABETEMARCO:
What else did she say?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.690
That she could help me
start my career.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.660
And change my life.

18:49.590 --> 18:50.710
I want to apologize, boss.

18:50.910 --> 18:52.180
I thought my presentation
was solid.

18:52.380 --> 18:53.710
But clearly--
It was.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.310
Wasn't solid enough
to convince the commissioner.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.880
PC had a
fair point.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.150
Vice's task force has
more experience in this area.

18:59.350 --> 19:00.850
Yeah, but they failed
to crack this one.

19:01.050 --> 19:03.050
Maybe the problem wasn't
your PowerPoint.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.160
Then what?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.570
Maybe it's your last name.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.160
No, um, I know him.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
So do I. But in a different way.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.700
Look, your father
is a great top cop,

19:13.900 --> 19:15.830
but the top cop
lives by a measure

19:16.030 --> 19:17.670
that the rest
of us don't.

19:17.870 --> 19:20.070
Namely, how many of our guys
are still alive

19:20.270 --> 19:21.570
at the end of the day?

19:21.770 --> 19:24.760
And the bigger the number,
the better his result.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.150
You knew about
those dead troopers.

19:28.350 --> 19:29.450
I did.

19:29.650 --> 19:30.620
But you didn't
mention them to me.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.100
Hadn't
mentioned it yet.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.570
And they didn't die
suddenly, either.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.010
They were tortured
before they were killed.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.500
And now you know
everything, so...

19:43.700 --> 19:45.330
you still want this?

19:45.530 --> 19:47.080
Yes, sir.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.170
You know, when
the need arose,

19:51.370 --> 19:53.740
your resume was head and
shoulders above the rest.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.240
But I almost didn't choose you.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.180
Why's that, boss?

19:57.380 --> 20:00.110
Because I didn't want
One PP looking over my shoulder

20:00.310 --> 20:02.630
every time things got dangerous.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.350
Went through every
single one of the files.

20:07.550 --> 20:08.850
Including yours.

20:09.050 --> 20:11.060
Says you prioritize
results over regulations.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.860
Apparently you have a tendency
to challenge authority.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.810
Only when my boss is a hump.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.260
I'll keep that in mind.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.100
I narrowed it down
to two names.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.100
Agent Sanchez

20:21.300 --> 20:22.750
and...
Martin.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.840
That's right.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.470
I worked with Sanchez
for 12 years.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.070
Man took a bullet in the stomach

20:28.270 --> 20:30.530
during a raid
on a cartel drug lab.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.810
No way it's him.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.630
Okay. Well, that leaves
Agent Martin.

20:36.430 --> 20:37.680
Says here

20:37.880 --> 20:39.050
he invested in a bar
outside of San Antonio

20:39.250 --> 20:40.320
a few years back.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.990
Right before the pandemic hit.

20:42.190 --> 20:43.150
Lost his shirt.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.720
That bar was
his retirement plan.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.030
Sounds like a person
who could use some cash.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.830
Maybe we feed him
a little bad intel,

20:51.030 --> 20:53.280
keep the cartel
chasing their tails.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.270
Then we bust him.

20:55.470 --> 20:57.500
After Rodriguez is arraigned.
Great.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.340
Sorry.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.260
I know he's one of your guys.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.660
Not anymore.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.380
Is Tristan
Edmonds here?

21:07.580 --> 21:09.680
Hey, yo, Tris?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.580
There are cops here for you.

21:11.780 --> 21:13.120
Nice tattoo.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.390
That street related?

21:14.590 --> 21:16.650
It is. But I got it
when I was inside.

21:16.850 --> 21:17.790
TRISTAN:
Officers.

21:17.990 --> 21:19.720
I got it from here, Keon,

21:19.920 --> 21:21.880
you go take your 15.
All right.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.500
Are you in the habit
of hiring gang members

21:25.700 --> 21:27.470
and ex-cons for jobs?
Yes.

21:27.670 --> 21:28.900
My mission is to provide

21:29.100 --> 21:30.500
the formerly incarcerated
with a second chance.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.870
Is that how you met Jamal?

21:32.070 --> 21:33.810
Jamal and I met
in middle school.

21:34.010 --> 21:36.170
We were the only two kids
in the school who loved hockey.

21:36.370 --> 21:38.010
Imagine two Black kids

21:38.210 --> 21:39.780
wearing Rangers
jerseys in the hood.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.450
That sounds like a special bond.
It was.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.720
We became brothers.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.620
Naomi is like a second mom
to me.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.180
I'd do anything for her.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.890
Must've been hard for you to
stay friends with a drug dealer.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.860
TRISTAN:
I can't lie,
our lives diverged a bit.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.330
I got a full scholarship
to private school

21:53.530 --> 21:54.990
and he enrolled
in the school of hard knocks.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.860
Turned to a life on the street.
Exactly.

21:58.060 --> 22:00.870
I can't deny it was hard
watching him go from...

22:01.070 --> 22:02.830
my goofy sidekick to a thug.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.140
Jamal had a rap sheet
for drug charges.

22:05.340 --> 22:06.170
That's not all.

22:06.370 --> 22:08.320
Jamal was in a gang.

22:15.430 --> 22:16.780
I can't eat this <i>basura.</i>

22:16.980 --> 22:18.450
You said you
wanted Mexican.

22:18.650 --> 22:20.020
Yes, so what the hell is this?

22:20.220 --> 22:21.320
Mexican food.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.950
GATES: Man's
got a point.

22:23.150 --> 22:25.390
Worst machaca I ever tasted.

22:25.590 --> 22:27.120
Tastes good to me.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.190
Figures.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.530
<i>Güero.</i>

22:29.730 --> 22:31.030
What did he just call me?

22:31.230 --> 22:33.420
You don't want to know.
(ringtone playing)

22:35.750 --> 22:37.820
Gates.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.570
Got it.

22:41.770 --> 22:43.690
What is it?

22:45.360 --> 22:48.480
Our people went to the false
location we fed Martin.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.030
DANNY:
Okay.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.380
And they left a message.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.620
What's that?

22:53.820 --> 22:56.100
Agent Martin's corpse.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.660
My offer still stands.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.260
DANNY:
Shut up.

23:02.460 --> 23:03.810
Gates.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.160
This is not on you.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.950
This is on Martin.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.750
He died on my watch.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.390
(sighs)

23:27.300 --> 23:28.990
DUGGIN: This is
about Scott Taylor?

23:29.190 --> 23:30.920
Could've saved
you the trip.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.520
All I know
about Scott

23:32.720 --> 23:35.190
is that he's a fantastic
basketball player.

23:35.390 --> 23:37.530
Well, it doesn't make him
a good guy.

23:37.730 --> 23:39.900
DUGGIN: Does
in my book.

23:40.100 --> 23:41.830
ABETEMARCO:
So, uh, Dave...

23:42.030 --> 23:43.570
you were a cop, huh?

23:43.770 --> 23:44.640
30 years.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.270
Some of the best
of my life.

23:47.470 --> 23:48.920
I'm from a cop family.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.140
I know it's not without
its challenges.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.680
It has its moments.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.620
Yeah, kind of like when
you know a perp is guilty,

23:57.820 --> 23:59.950
but they're using
their privilege to get off.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.990
That ever happen to you?
(Duggin chuckles)

24:02.190 --> 24:03.690
Too many times to count.

24:03.890 --> 24:05.320
Well, that's what
we're up against.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.890
Scott Taylor is not
who he says he is.

24:08.090 --> 24:09.160
He's hurting
a lot of people.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.550
We need your help to prove that.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.540
Sure wish I could help you.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.970
(typing)

24:19.170 --> 24:21.710
But it is time for me...

24:21.910 --> 24:24.060
to take my break.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.830
You're more than welcome
to hang around till I get back.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.370
ERIN:
Okay.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.680
(soft gasp)

24:44.480 --> 24:46.600
(grunts) Maybe this
was a mistake.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.900
I mean, we keep
looking for answers

24:48.100 --> 24:50.570
and so far the only thing
that comes up:

24:50.770 --> 24:52.270
Jamal wasn't a good guy.

24:52.470 --> 24:56.310
I take it you didn't find anyone
on the street with information?

24:56.510 --> 24:58.480
Let's just say
Detective Ricci was right.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.810
People weren't too anxious

25:00.010 --> 25:01.850
to talk about
an alleged gang member.

25:02.050 --> 25:05.700
Jamal received a lot of calls
from this number.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.540
How about we see
where this trail leads?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.880
Game on.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.100
How's it going
in there, Sean?

25:21.300 --> 25:22.800
SEAN: You can't
rush perfection.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.040
HENRY:
Perfection?

25:24.240 --> 25:25.170
I'd settle
for something

25:25.370 --> 25:26.370
edible right now.

25:26.570 --> 25:28.940
Pop, the master is at work.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.140
"The master"?
DANNY:
Sean is the cook

25:31.340 --> 25:32.810
in his new frat house.

25:33.010 --> 25:34.880
What are you doing?
Ordering takeout.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.450
(chuckling)
Just in case
we need a backup.

25:36.650 --> 25:38.350
DANNY: Great idea.
Jamie.
What?

25:38.550 --> 25:39.450
How does pizza sound?

25:39.650 --> 25:40.720
Order me a pepperoni.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.720
With extra pepperoni.
Veggie, please.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.020
HENRY:
Meat lovers for me.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.320
JAMIE: Okay,
fine, hold on.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.720
Well, I will have

25:45.920 --> 25:48.960
whatever the culinary artist
is preparing.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.830
(cheers and applause)

25:52.030 --> 25:55.130
The moment you have all
been waiting for.

25:55.330 --> 25:56.700
My specialty...

25:56.900 --> 25:59.770
chicken and penne à la vodka...

25:59.970 --> 26:01.870
à la Sean.

26:02.070 --> 26:03.560
ERIN:
Oh.
Wow.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.440
ERIN:
Are those peppers in there?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.010
SEAN: That's
the à la Sean.

26:07.210 --> 26:08.480
Smells almost edible.

26:08.680 --> 26:09.910
Who's up first?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.020
This guy.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.180
HENRY: Not I.
DANNY: Yeah, Dad,

26:12.380 --> 26:13.620
you, uh, were
so anxious

26:13.820 --> 26:15.590
to try Sean's masterpiece,

26:15.790 --> 26:17.140
why don't you try some?

26:21.010 --> 26:21.890
I'd be honored.

26:22.090 --> 26:23.560
DANNY:
All right!

26:23.760 --> 26:25.260
(cheers and applause)
ERIN:
Brave, brave man.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.330
HENRY:
Yeah.

26:26.530 --> 26:27.330
DANNY:
That's right.

26:27.530 --> 26:28.330
Thank you.

26:28.530 --> 26:29.530
You're gonna love it.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.040
Good luck, Dad.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.470
Mm.

26:32.670 --> 26:34.820
Oh, gosh.

26:35.690 --> 26:38.430
DANNY: It's very clay-like.
SEAN: Just a little more.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.310
Okay. Hope you like it.

26:42.510 --> 26:43.930
SEAN:
All right.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.650
Thank you.
Yeah.

26:46.850 --> 26:48.420
ERIN:
You're a good man.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.040
Boy...

26:55.780 --> 26:57.210
What say you, Dad?

27:00.650 --> 27:02.550
Ooh, that doesn't look
encouraging.

27:06.190 --> 27:07.840
DANNY:
Dad?

27:08.040 --> 27:10.410
It's fantastic.
ERIN: Oh!

27:10.610 --> 27:12.010
Wow.
Thank you.

27:12.210 --> 27:13.040
(cheering)

27:13.240 --> 27:14.280
Guess I'm next.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.450
SEAN:
Pass the plates.

27:15.650 --> 27:16.580
I'll cancel the pizza.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.420
No, don't cancel my pizza.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.930
(laughter)

27:28.340 --> 27:30.130
Got a minute?

27:30.330 --> 27:32.130
Thought you and Eddie went home.

27:32.330 --> 27:34.220
Yeah, she got a ride
with Erin.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.840
I, uh...

27:38.040 --> 27:40.890
I got something I need to say.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.240
This about
the undercover operation?

27:44.440 --> 27:46.140
It is.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.580
(sighs)

27:47.780 --> 27:49.780
I know you didn't get
the answer you wanted.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.520
Less about the answer
than the reason behind it.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.250
Jamie, it was purely
a personnel decision.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.520
But I'm the personnel.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.060
And my boss thinks that...

27:58.260 --> 27:59.890
you're trying to keep me
out of the line of fire.

28:00.090 --> 28:02.130
Well, then your boss
is way off-base

28:02.330 --> 28:03.330
and way out of line.

28:03.530 --> 28:05.260
Problem is:

28:05.460 --> 28:07.000
I think he's right.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.870
Well, that just puts you

28:09.070 --> 28:10.430
on the wrong side
of the line with him.

28:10.630 --> 28:11.570
You sure?

28:11.770 --> 28:14.240
Jamie, the toughest part
of my job

28:14.440 --> 28:16.670
is putting officers at risk,

28:16.870 --> 28:19.580
and in this case,
the risk was just too big.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.780
But I'm willing to accept it--

28:20.980 --> 28:22.960
But that's not your call.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.990
I assign hazardous duty
to my most experienced people.

28:30.190 --> 28:32.260
In this case,
that was the Vice team.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.090
Danny's guarding
Diego Rodriguez.

28:34.290 --> 28:35.830
It doesn't get
more dangerous than that.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.130
You could've had
the most experienced

28:37.330 --> 28:38.960
US Marshals handling it,
but you didn't.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.570
Danny has been fighting
that cartel for years.

28:41.770 --> 28:43.200
He knows the territory.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.600
And he's earned your trust.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.600
That's right.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.290
And I haven't.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.110
I didn't say that.

28:50.310 --> 28:51.830
You didn't have to.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.110
I'm just as capable.

28:54.310 --> 28:56.250
(sighs)

28:56.450 --> 28:57.580
I know that.

28:57.780 --> 28:59.180
It doesn't feel like it, and...

28:59.380 --> 29:01.190
I think I've earned the right
to do my job

29:01.390 --> 29:02.690
without you looking
over my shoulder.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.990
And so have I,

29:05.190 --> 29:07.570
without you looking over mine.

29:13.610 --> 29:15.850
* *

29:19.220 --> 29:20.640
(door opens)

29:20.840 --> 29:22.220
(door closes)
(sighs)

29:29.130 --> 29:31.620
Armored vehicle en route?
Yeah.

29:31.820 --> 29:32.880
30 minutes out.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.720
Then we can dump
this yo-yo at the courthouse.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.190
Are they ready
on the other end?
Yeah.

29:37.390 --> 29:38.920
I'm gonna bypass
the main security checkpoint,

29:39.120 --> 29:40.360
circle around to the back,

29:40.560 --> 29:42.130
enter through the south.

29:42.330 --> 29:43.390
Sounds like a plan.
(knocking)

29:43.590 --> 29:45.830
This just came for you,
Detective.

29:46.030 --> 29:48.170
You know who it's from?
No.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.280
Thanks, Serrano.

30:00.190 --> 30:01.900
Everything okay?

30:06.770 --> 30:08.800
(Frank sighs)

30:15.680 --> 30:17.860
Have these been authenticated?

30:18.060 --> 30:20.600
NYPD and DEA both authenticated.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.470
And have the local authorities

30:22.670 --> 30:24.240
where our kids are
been notified?

30:24.440 --> 30:26.900
Yeah. I'd like to bring
Jack and Nicky

30:27.100 --> 30:28.510
home to the city forthwith.

30:28.710 --> 30:30.930
I'll take care of that.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.210
Rodriguez's arraignment
is in a few hours.

30:35.410 --> 30:36.810
Once he's inside
that courthouse,

30:37.010 --> 30:37.980
cartel can't touch him.

30:38.180 --> 30:40.280
Understood.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.500
This is their last chance
to get him back, Dad.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.710
That ain't gonna happen.

30:49.740 --> 30:50.560
(sighs)

30:50.760 --> 30:53.100
Danny, our family's been subject

30:53.300 --> 30:55.130
to threats before, so...

30:55.330 --> 30:57.720
Cartel plays by different rules.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.600
They came for my wife,
I couldn't stop them.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.490
Danny.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.690
Don't.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.180
How do I deliver Rodriguez

31:10.380 --> 31:12.800
when it puts our family
in danger?

31:14.100 --> 31:15.220
(sighs)

31:15.420 --> 31:17.120
You do your job.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.240
And I promise you,
we'll do ours.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.020
(sighs)

31:36.690 --> 31:39.010
It's time to confess, Scott.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.040
(chuckles)

31:40.240 --> 31:41.850
Look, I didn't rape Shayla.

31:42.050 --> 31:43.450
Okay? We had fun.

31:43.650 --> 31:45.220
She was just mad
I wouldn't date her.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.200
I'm actually not speaking
about Shayla.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.890
I'm talking about...
Brittany Campbell,

31:51.090 --> 31:52.520
Megan Lee

31:52.720 --> 31:54.810
and Destiny Powell.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.270
Now, that wiped
the smile off your face.

32:02.470 --> 32:03.330
He doesn't know

32:03.530 --> 32:04.940
what you're talking about.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.400
We got access
to the campus security logs.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.040
ERIN: All three
of those women

32:09.240 --> 32:11.440
lodged sexual assault complaints
against Scott,

32:11.640 --> 32:14.410
and, just like Shayla,
mysteriously recanted.

32:14.610 --> 32:15.980
Which we're guessing
is your handiwork.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.180
A guess isn't evidence.

32:17.380 --> 32:18.220
No,

32:18.420 --> 32:19.480
but the nondisclosure agreements

32:19.680 --> 32:21.120
that all three
of these women signed...

32:21.320 --> 32:22.250
ABETEMARCO:
...that were drafted up

32:22.450 --> 32:24.160
by your former law firm...

32:24.360 --> 32:25.560
...are.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.390
That's a coincidence.

32:27.590 --> 32:29.530
We've spoken to all
three of these women.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.300
They're ready to press charges.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.030
And we hope Shayla will, too.

32:33.230 --> 32:34.330
LISA:
My client

32:34.530 --> 32:35.970
will sue them
for everything they have.

32:36.170 --> 32:38.650
And they are all ready for that.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.410
He'll cooperate.

32:47.610 --> 32:49.310
We're still looking to
go in the first round,

32:49.510 --> 32:50.450
so jail is a no-go.

32:50.650 --> 32:52.070
What kind of deal you offering?

32:52.970 --> 32:55.820
Oh, I'm not actually
offering a deal.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.320
Then why are we here?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.860
To tell you face-to-face

33:00.060 --> 33:03.010
that you're both gonna go down
for what you've done.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.200
Yeah, that's a...
(siren whooping)

33:13.400 --> 33:14.870
(siren wails)

33:15.070 --> 33:16.710
(tires screech)

33:16.910 --> 33:17.740
Go, go.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.710
Hey!

33:18.910 --> 33:20.080
Hey, we want to talk to you.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.080
(groans)

33:21.280 --> 33:22.680
Come on.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.280
Yo, look, I ain't no snitch.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.380
How well do you know Jamal?

33:25.580 --> 33:26.680
We ran together.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.650
And by "ran,"
you mean "sold drugs"?

33:27.850 --> 33:28.720
Your words, not mine.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.120
Is that why you wanted him dead?

33:30.320 --> 33:31.520
I didn't say that.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.290
Jamal's phone and text records
prove otherwise.

33:33.490 --> 33:34.390
No, no,
y'all got this all wrong.

33:34.590 --> 33:35.560
Then make it right.

33:35.760 --> 33:36.990
Look, yeah, I was mad

33:37.190 --> 33:38.500
Jamal wanted out, but...

33:38.700 --> 33:39.700
I wouldn't have
killed him over it.
Wait...

33:39.900 --> 33:41.200
Jamal wanted out of the gang?

33:41.400 --> 33:42.580
Yeah.

33:43.580 --> 33:44.770
Could someone have
killed him over it?

33:44.970 --> 33:46.140
I don't know.

33:46.340 --> 33:47.340
Looks like we're gonna
have to take this guy in.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.410
Yeah.
Okay.

33:48.610 --> 33:49.810
Look, look, right, but...

33:50.010 --> 33:51.040
I do know that

33:51.240 --> 33:53.690
no one was as pissed
as Tristan was.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.750
Tristan Edmonds?

33:56.950 --> 33:58.350
Duh.

33:58.550 --> 34:00.150
Why would
he be mad about

34:00.350 --> 34:01.690
Jamal getting out?

34:01.890 --> 34:03.220
So much for being detectives.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.320
Y'all ain't even know
Tristan is Ace Double Trey?

34:05.520 --> 34:07.540
(scoffs)

34:14.580 --> 34:16.670
So what'd your father say?

34:16.870 --> 34:18.240
DANNY: Same thing
he always says.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.570
"Do your job."

34:19.770 --> 34:21.170
He's got some bulldog in him.

34:21.370 --> 34:22.510
DANNY:
Toughest guy I know.

34:22.710 --> 34:25.440
But when he saw
those pictures, he was...

34:25.640 --> 34:27.140
he was scared.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.080
Understandable.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.550
DANNY:
We think we can protect
these kids, but...

34:31.750 --> 34:34.550
if the cartel wants
to get to them, they will.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.890
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that.

34:37.090 --> 34:40.190
Zaragozas want Rodriguez
back alive.

34:40.390 --> 34:41.730
Something happens to him,

34:41.930 --> 34:43.090
they go back to Mexico,

34:43.290 --> 34:45.580
start fighting over
who takes his place.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.830
Threat to your family goes away.

34:48.030 --> 34:50.800
Except we're not gonna
let that happen.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.570
Let's say we get back
to the safehouse

34:53.770 --> 34:55.940
and you mosey down to the corner
for a Big Red.

34:56.140 --> 34:57.310
A what?

34:57.510 --> 34:59.880
It's a Texas thing.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.180
Now, if Rodriguez has
a chance to escape,

35:03.380 --> 35:05.580
goes for my gun...

35:05.780 --> 35:08.570
I've got no choice
but to defend myself.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.470
Problem solved.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.730
Mm. Problem solved
until you get jammed up.

35:16.930 --> 35:19.630
Ain't no cameras
in that safehouse, hoss.

35:19.830 --> 35:21.780
I'll be all right.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.370
I appreciate you trying
to help me and mine,

35:25.570 --> 35:27.520
but I can't let you do that.

35:32.790 --> 35:35.150
Besides, there...

35:35.350 --> 35:37.760
there may be another way.

35:40.070 --> 35:43.490
My office intends
to charge Scott Taylor

35:43.690 --> 35:45.420
with three additional
counts of rape.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.520
(reporters clamoring)

35:47.720 --> 35:48.860
We'll also be charging
Lisa Reynolds

35:49.060 --> 35:50.730
with harassment
and witness tampering.

35:50.930 --> 35:52.100
(reporters shouting)

35:52.300 --> 35:54.300
We will not be taking
any questions,

35:54.500 --> 35:56.370
we will let the rest of this
play out in court.

35:56.570 --> 35:59.090
(reporters shouting)

36:03.560 --> 36:04.580
ABETEMARCO:
You did great.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.180
I can see the
headlines now:

36:06.380 --> 36:09.750
"Erin Reagan and her handsome
sidekick save the day."

36:09.950 --> 36:12.050
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule

36:12.250 --> 36:14.220
to meet with us.
I would do anything for Jamal.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.320
Except be honest.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.820
(entry bell chimes)

36:18.020 --> 36:20.640
Why didn't you tell us
you're an Ace Double Trey?

36:21.780 --> 36:24.300
Tristan, is that true?
Ma.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.900
Are you...? You're what?
It's not that simple.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.600
He's using this restaurant
as a front for laundering money.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.370
EDDIE:
You've been lying
to Naomi for years.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.690
I think she deserves the truth.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.240
You don't get it, Ma.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.680
I worked hard to pull myself
up out the gutter

36:42.880 --> 36:44.180
and make a name for myself.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.220
To make you proud.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.480
Yeah.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.300
And Jamal.

36:50.270 --> 36:51.690
He was my right-hand man

36:51.890 --> 36:53.220
and he went
and messed it all up.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.490
By leaving the gang?

36:54.690 --> 36:55.830
Jamal wanted
to go to the cops.

36:56.030 --> 36:57.280
He wanted to blow
the whistle on this place.

36:58.210 --> 37:00.400
Talking about he wants to go
legit and live a clean life.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.230
Everything we built would've
came down if he left.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.670
I did what I had to do.

37:04.870 --> 37:06.740
You killed your best friend.

37:06.940 --> 37:08.610
Oh, God.
I was protecting
what I built.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.920
You killed my son!

37:11.490 --> 37:13.110
You killed him!

37:13.310 --> 37:14.950
I'm sorry, Ma.
You killed him!

37:15.150 --> 37:17.080
You did it.
I had to do it.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.250
You killed...

37:18.450 --> 37:19.750
You...
Okay.
I had to do it.

37:19.950 --> 37:21.740
(Naomi sobbing)
(cuffs clicking)

37:24.410 --> 37:26.640
(entry bell chimes)

37:35.250 --> 37:36.430
Time to go.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.040
My people will never let us
get to the courthouse.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.710
If there's an ambush,
you're the first man to die.

37:41.910 --> 37:43.010
I'd rather go out
like that than

37:43.210 --> 37:45.880
waste away
in some supermax prison.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.580
Well, personally, I don't give
a damn what happens to you.

37:48.780 --> 37:51.550
But there are other people
that you might want to consider.

37:51.750 --> 37:52.920
Such as?

37:53.120 --> 37:54.550
Well, your people
threatened my family.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.920
(chuckles)
You can't blame me for that.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.410
But I do.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.210
Take a peek.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.670
GATES:
Your daughters are beautiful.

38:14.870 --> 38:15.740
(Rodriguez sighs)

38:15.940 --> 38:17.770
How the hell did you get this?

38:17.970 --> 38:20.780
It was taken 12 hours ago
at your ranch.

38:20.980 --> 38:22.310
Lovely place.

38:22.510 --> 38:23.650
You can't threaten
my children.

38:23.850 --> 38:25.250
You're a cop.

38:25.450 --> 38:26.530
DANNY:
Yeah, I am.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.920
But if something were
to happen to my family,

38:29.120 --> 38:30.620
I probably wouldn't
go on being a cop.

38:30.820 --> 38:32.460
I'd be so
distraught.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.740
There's no telling
what I would do.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.560
GATES: Call
off your men.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.600
DANNY: Call
off your men,

38:39.800 --> 38:42.180
and we'll call off ours.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.820
Remind me never
to mess with you.

39:02.020 --> 39:03.920
Right back at ya.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.220
I think you earned
that hat, partner.

39:07.420 --> 39:08.430
Thank you.

39:08.630 --> 39:12.010
What say we mosey off
into the sunset?

39:12.950 --> 39:14.100
RODRIGUEZ:
Julio?

39:14.300 --> 39:15.920
(speaks Spanish)

39:38.640 --> 39:39.720
(sighs)

39:39.920 --> 39:41.980
(door opening)

39:43.210 --> 39:44.380
He's here.

39:47.410 --> 39:49.320
Let's have him.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.390
Please have a seat.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.460
(sighs)

40:03.700 --> 40:05.380
About last night.

40:05.580 --> 40:06.450
You were dead wrong.

40:06.650 --> 40:08.350
Sorry you feel that way.

40:08.550 --> 40:11.660
I do not think Danny is
a better cop than you.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.320
Different, yeah, but not better.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.060
Okay.

40:15.260 --> 40:16.660
And I hate feeling that somehow

40:16.860 --> 40:18.290
I'm supposed to prove that
to you.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.600
And I resent being put
in that position.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.000
I didn't mean to...

40:22.200 --> 40:24.540
Yeah, well, I know that.
At least I think I do.

40:24.740 --> 40:26.790
The effect's the same.

40:28.390 --> 40:29.770
But...

40:29.970 --> 40:31.680
that is father and son stuff

40:31.880 --> 40:34.390
and that's not what we do here.

40:35.330 --> 40:37.180
Lieutenant Fleming was
delayed in the field,

40:37.380 --> 40:41.070
so you will please debrief him
on this meeting.

40:45.640 --> 40:49.930
I am transferring Vice Unit's
human trafficking investigation

40:50.130 --> 40:53.930
of the Carolinas Ring
to your team.

40:54.130 --> 40:57.250
Along with their intel
and their assets.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.040
Thank you, sir.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.070
I will need full debriefings

41:03.270 --> 41:06.140
before any undercover
is inserted--

41:06.340 --> 41:09.950
in person, open-ended,
because I will have questions.

41:10.150 --> 41:11.650
Understood.

41:11.850 --> 41:13.520
And one additional request.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.200
Sir.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.720
(sighs)

41:19.920 --> 41:22.510
Be careful.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.110
Yes, sir.

41:38.590 --> 41:39.480
(door opens)

41:39.680 --> 41:40.990
