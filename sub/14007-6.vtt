00:00.600 --> 00:02.900
Previously on Damages:

00:02.900 --> 00:06.600
When Daniel Purcell flipped on the stand
he humiliated you in open court

00:06.600 --> 00:10.200
This is all about
Ultima National Resources.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.200
If you don't stop them, I will.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.000
- Do you want my help?
- Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.400
Whatever happened that night
in your house with your wife is over.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.100
This is a partnership now.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.900
- My legal advice is to eliminate exposure.
- Okay.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.500
- Did you tell anyone about us?
- No.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.400
Let me use the firm's resources to prove
that Frobisher had David killed.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.000
This is Detective Rick Messer.
He asked if he could take a look around.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.400
I'm very sorry for your loss.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.600
It's my fault.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.800
No. I know you're not
the enemy in all of this.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.700
- You're early.
- I know.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.200
Come in.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.099
- Want a drink?
- No, I'm good.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.500
The movie doesn't start
for another hour.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.600
Where's Mark?

01:08.600 --> 01:11.300
He's going to meet us
at the theater.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.600
I thought you and I could talk first.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.300
Sure. What's up?

01:17.800 --> 01:19.500
What's this?

01:19.700 --> 01:23.700
It's the security deposit
from your and David's apartment.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.700
The lease isn't up for another month.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.900
Yeah, I know, but they said
they could rent it a month early.

01:31.900 --> 01:35.800
- They said they were going to call you.
- No.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.700
No one called.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.100
I'm so sorry.
I thought you knew.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.200
My parents have packed
everything up, so...

01:50.700 --> 01:53.300
It's all ready to be moved.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.900
I thought that  I'd

01:57.000 --> 01:59.900
go back there one last time.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.500
Ellen, don't put yourself through that.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.800
The movers can put everything
into storage.

02:06.900 --> 02:12.000
If feels like that apartment's
all that I've got left of him.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.600
El, don't go back there.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
Damages s02e06

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
We're back with litigator Patty Hewes

03:04.300 --> 03:07.500
who somehow made it past
security with an axe.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
And she's looking to grind it.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.400
I've never seen you like this.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.100
Even Arthur Frobisher never
inspired this kind of attack.

03:15.100 --> 03:18.600
Arthur Frobisher has
nothing on Walter Kendrick.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.900
Kendrick and his company Ultima
National Resources have

03:21.900 --> 03:25.100
systematically ravaged the environment.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.700
But has the company
done anything illegal?

03:27.700 --> 03:31.700
Walter Kendrick is a corporate thug

03:31.700 --> 03:35.000
who's gone out of his way to
shield himself from litigation.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.900
Kendrick believes that
he can get away with anything.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.500
The tragedy is, so far he has.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.600
I mean, have you ever heard of
a toxin called Aracite?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
No, never.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.700
That's because Walter Kendrick
doesn't want you to.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.700
He's using it in his facility
in West Virginia

03:49.700 --> 03:51.300
and it's poisoning people.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.800
Can you prove that?

03:52.800 --> 03:56.000
UNR did its own study
and determined Aracite to be safe,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.900
which is, you know,
no big surprise,

03:58.900 --> 04:00.900
but a high-level consultant from

04:00.900 --> 04:03.900
an independent research firm
reported otherwise,

04:03.900 --> 04:05.700
and now his wife is dead.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.800
Ms. Hewes, are you implying
that Walter Kendrick

04:09.800 --> 04:11.600
is responsible for a murder?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.300
Implying it?

04:13.300 --> 04:15.800
I hope that's not what this
sounds like, Greta.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.399
I'm stating it outright.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.600
Patty Hewes said a few things on TV.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.200
- I heard.
- You have to take it seriously, Walt.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.800
It's outrageous.
She accused you of murder.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.000
She's a madwoman.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.900
Maybe, but people listen to her.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.400
She's a virtual celebrity now.
Riding high on Frobisher.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.100
We cannot afford...

04:33.100 --> 04:38.200
Arthur Frobisher is a narcissistic dipshit
who stumbled his way into billions.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.800
He dumped his own stock with
the whole world watching.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.600
Forget Frobisher.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.000
This is about Patty Hewes.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.100
We humiliated her in court.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.100
She wants to destroy you now.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.600
We have to shut her up.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
???

04:52.600 --> 04:55.200
Send a cease and desist order.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.900
Ah, it's not enough.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.400
The stock price fell today.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.000
I'll set up a meeting with
the major shareholders--  reassure them.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.200
Regardless, we can't let
Patty's accusations hang out there.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.600
I want to sue her.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.800
- For what?
- Well, obviously for defamation.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.100
We can't get involved in a lawsuit.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.300
That's just going to keep her
bullshit story alive.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.600
What are our options?

05:25.300 --> 05:27.600
Ignore it until she goes away.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.800
Patty's not going to go away.
She accused you of murder.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.700
7 weeks earlier

05:41.700 --> 05:44.300
Is everything taken care of?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.400
Not yet.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.700
Jesus Christ!

05:49.300 --> 05:51.600
What do you want me to do?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.300
Okay.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.400
I think we should sue.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.700
But you're the boss, Walt.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.100
It's your decision.

06:16.200 --> 06:20.700
Are you positive UNR is
behind Christine Purcell's murder?

06:20.700 --> 06:22.400
Of course not.
How could I be?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.500
Then why are you on national television
hurling accusations at him?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.800
To make it personal.

06:30.400 --> 06:35.700
Oh, by the way, I want you to work up
a complete background on Claire Maddox.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.400
I need to know who we're dealing with here.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.300
What do you think Patty Hewes is up to?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.500
She's on the warpath.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.900
She's beating the tom-toms.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.300
She's furious because of
what I did to her in that courtroom,

06:51.300 --> 06:54.900
and she's going to do everything she can
to take it out on your company.

06:54.900 --> 06:58.100
Why didn't you ever tell me
about your history with her?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.500
It had nothing to do with us.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.500
What else haven't you
told me about, Danny?

07:04.500 --> 07:08.500
If I haven't shared things with you...

07:10.200 --> 07:12.900
it's for your own protection.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.700
I'm not your daughter.
I don't need protection.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.100
Why don't you come out
to the country this weekend?

07:22.100 --> 07:24.600
I don't think I can.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.100
When can I see you again?

07:29.700 --> 07:32.900
I don't think you
will see me again, Danny.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.600
I see.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.200
It's gotten a little complicated,
don't you think?

07:41.500 --> 07:45.900
Your company, my company,
Patty Hewes, your wife.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.800
It was a mistake getting
involved with you.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.100
Then why did you come here tonight?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.900
To tell you in person.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.000
That was the last time.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.600
Take care.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.500
- Katie.
- I'm at the police station.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.400
- What is it?
- I was mugged.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.600
Can you pick me up
at the 19th Precinct?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.400
I'll be right there.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.400
I came out of the subway and

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I walked about a block.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.900
Which direction?

08:44.700 --> 08:47.800
Um, east, I think.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.900
And then I took a left.

08:49.900 --> 08:50.900
North?

08:50.900 --> 08:55.600
Right. And then he came up behind me
and grabbed my bag.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.800
All right, wait here. I just need to
get some forms for you to fill out.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.700
Hey, are you following me?

09:31.700 --> 09:33.200
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.100
Stay away from me!

09:51.600 --> 09:53.200
It was the same guy.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.800
- Are you sure?
- Look at this.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.700
This is the man
who was following me.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.500
And this was back when Frobisher wanted you
to sign the confidentiality agreement.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.800
Yes! He's a cop.

10:01.900 --> 10:05.100
I think he saw me, Ellen.
I don't know what to do.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.700
Okay, all right,
just sit down, all right?

10:06.700 --> 10:09.400
Calm down.
We'll figure this out.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.900
Now, if this guy traces back to
Frobisher in any way,

10:12.900 --> 10:14.900
we will find him.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.800
Okay?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.100
I promise.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.300
Yeah. Fine, Pam.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.500
I will sign the paperwork tonight.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.600
Hey. Hey.
You want to knock that off?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.900
All right, I am hanging up.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.300
Sorry.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.700
There's a cop I need you
to look into.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.800
Why?

10:43.800 --> 10:46.600
He may have something to do
with my fiancy's murder.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.100
Well, then...
we can't help you.

10:50.100 --> 10:54.200
Our investigation is limited to
Patty Hewes and her firm.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.100
Well, do it as a favor.
I need your help.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.700
- We can't.
- You're FBI-- you can do whatever you want.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.900
- Ellen...
- I'm telling you,this guy may be a killer.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.200
And I'm telling you
our hands are tied.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.200
He's right--
we are not authorized to do that.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
This is bullshit.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.300
I need your help.

11:13.300 --> 11:16.500
last year before Katie's deposition
she was being followed.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.900
I remember.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.900
This is the guy.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.100
He's a policeman.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.900
He must have been working for Frobisher.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.800
No wonder they haven't gotten
anywhere with David's murder.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.400
This is my first real lead.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.100
You told me I could use the firm
to go after Frobisher.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.500
My resources are your resources.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.300
Thank you.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.600
- Katie Connors saw you?
- Yes.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.300
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
What if she talks?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.600
She can't prove anything.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.800
But her friend, Ellen Parsons,
has been meeting with the Feds.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.500
Since when?

11:55.500 --> 11:57.300
I'm not sure.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.000
Well, Katie Connor made me.
So what do we do?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.800
You?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.700
You do nothing.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.000
Keep your mouth shut,

12:07.100 --> 12:09.200
and I'll handle the rest.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.400
Eight-passenger seating,
six-liter V-8 engine,

12:19.400 --> 12:21.700
with hybrid dual-mode transmission.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.900
Better city fuel economy than
the Mini Cooper S convertible.

12:24.900 --> 12:28.000
Seriously?
Impressive.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.900
- Does it have a navigation system?
- Oh, absolutely.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.600
It's DVD-based,
with turn-by-turn directions.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.600
I'll take it.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.700
Do you want to, uh,
take a test drive?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.700
I said I'll take it.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.000
Great. Uh, let me find my manager--
we can talk finance.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
We don't need any of that.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.500
I'll pay cash.
Sticker price.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.100
Car practically sells itself.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.100
What do you mean,
the UNR merger doesn't make sense?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.700
It's bad business.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.900
Kendrick overpaid to acquire
that company.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.500
Why would the UNR board let him do that?

13:29.500 --> 13:32.900
Because Kendrick makes money.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.900
Every gamble he's ever taken
has paid off.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.300
Well, if he overpaid he must
have a way to make that money back.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.800
Yeah.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.900
We have to find out what that is.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.900
You aren't concerned
about the Feds looking into you?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.300
We'll just...

13:58.100 --> 14:01.700
watch our step
and keep our eyes open.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.700
You know what I'm in the mood for?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.600
What's that?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.400
A fight.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.400
The merger's gone through.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.800
Are you ready on your end?

14:29.900 --> 14:33.500
Yeah. Let's get going.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.200
I prefer paintings I understand.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.400
Foxes, hounds, bugles,
that kind of thing.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.100
All this abstraction looks
the same to me.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.700
Well, in this case,
Dave, you're right.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.800
This piece of shit is a waste of canvas.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.800
I'm gonna try and claw my way
to the ladies'.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.900
And don't sneak out for a smoke.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.500
- Think of your heart.
- I know, I know.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.600
I' meet you at the seats.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.700
Walt Kendrick!

15:20.700 --> 15:23.600
Hey. Arthur Frobisher.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
I know.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.100
Yeah. We met once,
uh-- oh, shit, where...

15:27.100 --> 15:29.200
- Davos.
- Yeah, Switzerland,right, yeah.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.500
The economic forum.
Musharraf wouldn't shut up,remember that?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.900
Ooh, man, ballet.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.100
Can never get into it.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.200
Even the dancers--which is kind of odd
You know, you'd think,

15:42.200 --> 15:44.500
what could go wrong
with a pretty girl in a leotard?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.300
But that body type does nothing for me.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
I like 'em a little meatier.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.600
How come you're here?
Your girlfriend drag you?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.000
Other way around.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
No shit. You like ballet?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I like Balanchine.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.800
Only reason I come to this crap
hole of a city is for the culture.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Yeah, that's right.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.600
- Uh, I thought West Virginia was your roost.
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.400
I've been spending more time up here.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.800
Since the merger.
Yeah, of course, of course.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.400
Congratulations, by the way.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.700
Sailed right through the Trade Commission.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.200
I've been watching your stock.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.700
Too bad about today's little dip, though.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.400
Volatility is part of the game.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.100
Oh, of course.
You'll bounce right back.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.300
But Patty Hewes won't let us
forget about you.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.900
Slinging shit like that all over
the airwaves.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.200
What the hell'd you do to her, anyway?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.900
Never even met her.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.700
Wow. Well...

16:41.100 --> 16:42.900
take this from me.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.400
Don't engage with her.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.000
You step into the ring with that woman,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.700
she will cut your balls off
and jam 'em down your throat.

16:50.100 --> 16:53.200
My advice, when she straps one on,

16:53.200 --> 16:56.600
bend over, bite down hard
and just take it.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.300
Anyway... it's good to see you.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.500
Claire, it's me.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.099
Sue the bitch.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.900
Here's what I got on Claire Maddox--

17:13.900 --> 17:17.500
name of law school, Supreme Court clerkship,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.599
Spends three years at
a white-collar firm in DC,

17:19.599 --> 17:22.200
and then is handpicked by Kendrick

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
to join the UNR legal department.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.599
She's spent the last 18 years there.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.000
- Doing what?
- Kicking ass, mainly.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.600
Starts in litigation working
antitrust but quickly

17:33.600 --> 17:36.800
gets bumped up to associate general counsel.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.200
Kendrick championed Maddox.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.900
He took her under his wing.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.700
She's the only female attorney
in his company.

17:43.700 --> 17:47.100
Then he added vice president to
her title, but, uh...

17:47.300 --> 17:49.400
that's not all, there's, uh...

17:50.100 --> 17:51.900
...rumors.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.200
About?

17:53.200 --> 17:57.800
A relationship between Kendrick and Maddox
that is less than professional.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.500
- Interesting.
- But not substantiated.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.100
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.900
I'm sorry, I-I fail to see the strategy
in calling Walter Kendrick

18:07.900 --> 18:10.400
a murderer on national television.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.300
???

18:13.300 --> 18:16.000
Ms. Hewes, it's urgent.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.000
- Patty Hewes?
- Yes?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
You've been served.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.000
What is it?

18:31.200 --> 18:34.200
It's a defamation suit.

18:34.700 --> 18:38.700
UNR's suing me for $200 million.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
You leaving?

19:22.400 --> 19:25.100
Yeah, I just got called in.
I'm gonna see you later.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.200
- I love you
- I love you, too.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.100
You're gonna look sexy
when you're bald.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.700
david

20:04.800 --> 20:07.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.500
I don't know if you remember me.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.300
I live in 5E.
I'm president of the co-op board.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.000
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.900
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:15.900 --> 20:20.500
I never really got to know David,
but he seemed like a great guy.

20:22.300 --> 20:25.900
Anyway, this was, uh,
delivered a while back.

20:25.900 --> 20:29.200
I didn't have a phone number for you,
and you didn't ave a forwarding address,

20:29.200 --> 20:32.600
so, uh, I've been hanging onto it.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.000
Thank you.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.700
The statements Ms.Hewes made were true,
and therefore she has an absolute defense.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.800
Ms. Hewes claimed my client
murdered a woman,

21:24.800 --> 21:27.400
a woman whose actual killer
was incarcerated.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
There's absolutely no way
she can prove her allegations.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
All right, slow down.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.200
This is true?

21:34.200 --> 21:37.100
Your client believes Mr.Kendrick

21:37.100 --> 21:38.800
murdered this Christine Purcell?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.400
Not with his own hands, but yeah.

21:40.400 --> 21:45.400
Ms. Hewes believes that Mr.Kendrick
commissioned this murder.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.100
And what do the police
think of that theory?

21:48.100 --> 21:50.400
The man who was arrested
for Christine Purcell's murder,

21:50.400 --> 21:54.000
Kevin Walker, was killed in prison.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.200
Assistant D.A. Deevers is
looking into his death.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.800
And has found nothing.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.300
So now you're accusing
the plaintiff of two murders?

22:01.300 --> 22:04.900
The claim my client made,
the subject of this suit,

22:04.900 --> 22:07.800
is the murder of Christine Purcell.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.400
Mr. Kendrick has never been accused or even questioned
by the police about either of these deaths.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.000
We'd be happy to present our own evidence
that Mr. Kendrick was involved.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.200
Your own evidence?

22:16.200 --> 22:18.300
This is an obvious stunt to present their own

22:18.300 --> 22:21.800
so-called evidence as a way of
further defaming my client.

22:21.800 --> 22:26.000
Ms. Hewes, do you have a response to that?

22:26.500 --> 22:29.200
I defer to my attorney.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.300
All right, listen,

22:31.300 --> 22:35.700
I was tasked by the judge to encourage
a settlement here, so let's get to it.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.100
What's it gonna take?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.900
Well, Ms. Maddox should consider this:

22:38.900 --> 22:40.900
if she pursues this action,

22:40.900 --> 22:44.700
our only defense is to prove
these murder accusations.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.600
Does she really want that aired
in open court?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.200
And I think Mr.Shayes should consider this:

22:50.200 --> 22:52.700
if he can't prove my client was responsible,

22:52.700 --> 22:58.300
a jury is going to ram a $200 million bill
up his client's ass.

22:58.700 --> 23:03.500
Well, it seems to me you both
have incentive to come to terms.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.400
Are you busy?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.500
Just doing some red-lining for Tom. Why?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.400
I'm starving.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.600
David used to do
most of the cooking for us.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.400
Phil's out of town,

23:33.400 --> 23:36.500
just in case you think
I'm neglecting him.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.000
He goes away so much,
it must be hard.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.400
So is UNR serious about
this defamation suit,

23:50.400 --> 23:52.900
or are they just trying to
intimidate you?

23:52.900 --> 23:56.200
Walter Kendrick is serious
about everything he does.

23:56.200 --> 24:00.000
- We want his stock price to keep falling, right?
- Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.100
The judge has ordered the case into mediation.
He wants us to settle.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.600
Do you have any idea
what else Kendrick is up to?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.800
No, not yet.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.300
???

24:27.700 --> 24:30.500
You told Patty that I saw the guy?

24:30.500 --> 24:34.100
I know how you feel about her,
but she has resources we can use.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.300
So what have you found out?

24:36.300 --> 24:40.400
Nothing yet,
but I'm gonna hear something soon.

24:41.300 --> 24:44.400
Elle, are you okay?
What's going on?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.900
I went back to the apartment.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.400
What? Why?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.800
I need to see it again.

24:56.400 --> 25:00.300
When I was there,
I got a package.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.800
It was from David.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.400
What are you talking about, Elle?

25:06.400 --> 25:09.300
He ordered it before he died.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.400
It was delivered to the building.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.600
What was it?

25:14.200 --> 25:16.400
It was my wedding present.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.400
Oh, my God.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.700
What did he give you?

25:23.600 --> 25:25.400
I don't know.

25:27.900 --> 25:31.300
I can't bring myself to open it.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.600
I think I know what
Patty Hewes is angling for.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
Tell me.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.200
We both know why she went on television.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.500
To drive our stock price down.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.700
Yes. But I've been thinking.

25:46.700 --> 25:50.500
Her real goal may be to file a lawsuit
on behalf of our shareholders.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.600
She'll claim that the stock took a hit
because of the merger and poor management.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.500
Well, I've already
reassured our shareholders.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.900
And everyone's in line.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.100
Patty can't sue us without a plaintiff.

26:03.100 --> 26:06.200
I think we should settle the defamation suit
before she finds one.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.200
Why let her off the hook?
She knows she can't beat me in court.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.800
Right. So she'll be motivated
to make a deal.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.500
No.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.200
She picked this fight.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.700
I'm not letting this slide.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.800
Walt, our stock won't recover until
Patty retracts her statements.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.800
I think we let her off easy financially,

26:24.800 --> 26:27.900
provided she admits that she had
no basis for her accusations.

26:27.900 --> 26:31.700
That way, we neutralize her statements
and avoid a long trial.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.200
Walt.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.500
Everyone's got dirty laundry.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.500
Do you really want Patty Hewes
going through yours?

26:43.300 --> 26:47.600
Don't give her any more time
to find a plaintiff.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.200
What are you doing for dinner?

26:54.200 --> 26:55.400
That's your answer?

26:55.400 --> 26:58.300
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.700
I'm getting together with friends tonight.
You want to come along?

27:00.700 --> 27:05.000
You need to decide.
Are you going to settle or not?

27:06.200 --> 27:09.300
You'll have my answer by dessert.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.700
4 months later

28:52.900 --> 28:55.200
Ah, there's my lawyer.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.200
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.000
Excuse me. What's your poison?

29:03.000 --> 29:06.100
A vodka martini,
dirty, extra olive.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.200
Put you over there
next to Mitch.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.800
Mitch McCullen, Claire Maddox.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.000
Hi.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
- Lovely to meet you,Claire.
- Nice to meet you,too.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.300
Demographically,
the entire nation is changing.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.800
We'll all be in the minority by 2040.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.800
But it's not just us;
the entire balance of power in the world

29:22.800 --> 29:24.800
is swinging hard towards Asia.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.200
How does that make you feel?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.200
Me personally?

29:29.500 --> 29:33.800
Well, there is no one more endangered
than the American Caucasian male.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.400
Excuse me. I need to make a call.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.900
Your Manhattan.

29:39.900 --> 29:43.100
- I ordered an old-fashioned.
- Are you sure?

29:43.100 --> 29:45.000
He ordered an old-fashioned.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.500
Forgive me, sir.
I'll be right back.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.400
Job doesn't seem too difficult.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.000
You think he'd getonedrink right.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.400
I'm going to stretch my legs.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.100
Would you like some company?

30:02.100 --> 30:05.500
Oh, no, I'll just be a few minutes.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.700
Thanks.

30:12.300 --> 30:15.600
So what do you think?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.600
I'd have worn a shorter skirt
if I'd known I was getting pimped out.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.000
Oh, come on, Claire.

30:21.100 --> 30:24.600
Mitch lost his wife three years ago
in a car accident.

30:24.600 --> 30:28.100
He's not just looking for
a roll in the sack.

30:28.700 --> 30:32.100
Course, it doesn't hurt he's
got his own island.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.400
I don't need help
with my personal life, Walt.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.300
Give the guy a chance.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.100
Okay, I will.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.700
If you give me an answer
about the settlement.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.700
Our stock is still dropping.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.500
Have you made up your mind?

30:52.800 --> 30:57.200
I'm telling you, Patty wants
to file a shareholders' suit.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.700
Okay. Settle.

31:05.700 --> 31:09.700
It's part of Internal Affairs called
the Citizens Review Board.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.200
I filed a complaint.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.800
A complaint?
You can't trust the police with this.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.600
- What was I supposed to do?
- I told you I would handle it.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.200
And nothing happened.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.300
His name is Eliot Tolken.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.700
He's been disciplined a half
a dozen times for excessive force.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.900
Each time he keeps getting reinstated.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.900
Someone in the department
is clearly protecting this guy.

31:33.900 --> 31:37.400
- And can you get him arrested?
- There's nothing to arrest him for.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.200
So Patty can't help me then, can she?

31:39.200 --> 31:42.400
We want to trace this guy back to Frobisher,
then Patty's the one to do it.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.600
- What is it with you and that woman?
- Katie...

31:44.600 --> 31:47.400
David's murdered, and you go right
back to working with her.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.300
- You don't understand.
- All I know is, if you had never met Patty,

31:50.300 --> 31:53.200
my brother would still be alive.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.500
You don't have to blame me, okay?

31:57.500 --> 32:00.200
I spend enough time blaming myself.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.600
Do you? Really?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.300
Yes, and I'm trying to make things right.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.000
- How?
- I can't explain it all.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.900
This is such bullshit, and you accuse
me of not dealing with reality?

32:11.900 --> 32:14.300
I know what I'm doing, Katie, okay?
This is over your head.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.900
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry, but there are bigger things going on here.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.500
Things that you wouldn't understand.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.100
Right, because you're the lawyer,
and I'm an idiot.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.100
Look, Katie, you got a pretty shitty
track record of your life decisions,

32:24.100 --> 32:26.900
so please just let me handle this.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.700
Go to hell.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.700
Can you zip me?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.800
Should I put on some music?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.300
What do you like?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.600
I like silence.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.500
You smoke?

32:59.500 --> 33:01.900
I used to.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.000
Now I only smoke one.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.200
At the end of every day.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.500
- Only one?
- Only one.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.700
No, thanks.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.000
I smoke it alone.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.000
???

34:19.900 --> 34:23.199
Ten million to Mr.Kendrick's preferred charity.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.900
Three.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.199
Eight.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.100
- Four.
- Seven.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.100
Five.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.600
Five is fine.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.800
I think we have an agreement.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.900
Always nice when cooler heads prevail.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.500
What is the charity?

34:41.500 --> 34:43.300
The NRA.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.100
She's kidding.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.100
It's Environment First,

34:52.100 --> 34:54.699
a local West Virginia organization.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.000
That's perfect.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.300
So, if you'll sign
the memorandum of agreement

34:58.300 --> 35:01.300
we can send it right
on up to the judge.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.100
Five million to charity.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.800
I feel good.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.600
I'm surprised.
It could've been a lot worse.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.600
They could have destroyed us in court.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.300
The only reason they settled was
to stop their stock price

35:19.300 --> 35:22.400
from hemorrhaging before
we could find a plaintiff.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.200
Too late.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.200
- Claire Maddox?
- Yes.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.200
You've been served.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.500
- What is that?
- A lawsuit.

35:42.500 --> 35:46.700
Patty Hewes has just sued us on
behalf of a major UNR shareholder.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.500
Who?

35:50.300 --> 35:52.200
Thank you for your discretion.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.500
I didn't want all my associates
to know we're working together yet.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.100
You're welcome.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.500
I think your little
te-a-tete with Kendrick

36:03.500 --> 36:06.000
gave him the extra push we need.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.400
Listen, I will be your plaintiff,

36:08.400 --> 36:11.500
but we're not friends.
I don't like you.

36:12.300 --> 36:16.100
Well, I'm just glad
we could help each other out.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.600
I'm in this for me.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.600
Understood.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.600
???

36:28.600 --> 36:33.100
Katie, it's me.
Please call me back.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.200
I'm sorry.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.800
We need to talk.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.800
Patty?

37:03.800 --> 37:07.400
I found a UNR shareholder
who's willing to sue the company.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.800
That's good news.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.300
Claire Maddox will try to get it
thrown out of court,

37:12.300 --> 37:15.600
but if we can get to
the discovery phase,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.200
we can find out what Kendrick is hiding.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.600
I look forward to it.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.400
How are things going with Katie?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.800
Good, yeah. Fine.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.100
The policeman she saw...

37:35.100 --> 37:39.300
hopefully he'll lead back to Frobisher.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.500
Shit.
She filed a complaint?

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
It's not an issue.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
I have friends in Internal Affairs.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.800
If the C.C.R.B. kicks it upstairs

37:52.800 --> 37:56.400
- we'll find a way to make it disappear.
- All right.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.600
But that doesn't mean
the problem goes away.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.000
That's what I'm saying.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.500
We need to do what we should've done
a long time ago.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.100
all  right

38:24.500 --> 38:27.200
You really should lock your door.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.400
Where...

38:31.400 --> 38:33.200
is the goddamn videotape?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.100
I don't know.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.700
Well, what about David Connor?

38:38.700 --> 38:41.200
Do I have to worry about him?

38:41.700 --> 38:42.900
No.

38:43.900 --> 38:46.500
There's nothing that can
get back to you.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.600
4 months later

39:05.400 --> 39:07.800
Wes, is that you?

39:22.300 --> 39:23.800
Wes?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
