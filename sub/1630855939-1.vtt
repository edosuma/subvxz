Do you wanna be entertained?
Don't change the channel.

00:14.708 --> 00:18.375
Because in two minutes,
I will die before your eyes.

00:19.041 --> 00:23.833
I've leaked my location to your overlord,
Eden Innovation Technologies,

00:23.833 --> 00:26.791
a corporation that rose
from a crumbling empire

00:26.791 --> 00:30.958
that was once called
the United States of America.

00:30.958 --> 00:34.083
Crime, poverty, anarchy.

00:34.083 --> 00:37.791
Eden made it all disappear
by bringing UBI,

00:37.791 --> 00:43.375
Universal Basic Income,
an idealist stipend for obedience.

00:43.375 --> 00:47.375
Yeah. Eden saved you.
They brought you stability.

00:47.916 --> 00:50.375
You're free now. Mm-hmm.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.125
You're free to work,
as long as it's for Eden.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.250
You're free to eat,
as long as it's Eden's food.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.041
Free to consume
Eden's revisionist bullshit.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.375
And if you don't agree...

01:01.166 --> 01:02.166
[exhales]

01:02.666 --> 01:06.291
...they will instantaneously
turn you into something you're not.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.708
A monster. A terrorist to shoot on sight.

01:08.708 --> 01:12.083
No arrest. No trial.
Just as they're about to murder me.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.916
So you bow before Eden,

01:14.916 --> 01:19.333
regurgitating their propaganda
in exchange for their daily handouts.

01:20.125 --> 01:24.583

you know there is only one way out.

Would you please stop moaning?

In two days, we're out of Eden,

It would be easier to just rob a bank.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.625

02:52.625 --> 02:56.166
And no bank in Eden's got
untraceable credits and unlimited funds.

I'm just saying, Dolph.

03:12.250 --> 03:15.250
Being a rebel outlaw
means adapting to circumstance.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.833
One! You're gonna give me that cartridge.

12:42.833 --> 12:47.083
And two! You're gonna give yourself up,
Captain Laserjoke.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.458
I'm gonna have to kill you
for that terrible pun.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.916
- [fingers snap]
- Hey! You're that guy from TV, right?

12:51.916 --> 12:54.041
[Red stammers] I'm not "that guy from TV"!

12:54.041 --> 12:56.250
I dedicated myself to this army,

12:56.250 --> 12:59.458
and they picked you
for their ultimate cyber soldier?!

12:59.458 --> 13:02.583
[exhales] Fucking identity politics
ruin everything!

13:02.583 --> 13:03.750
Here we go again.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.166
[Red] Form the rainbow!

13:08.041 --> 13:11.208
[Niji 6] Niji 6!

13:12.541 --> 13:14.083
[Black] Ready to blow his face off, Red.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.458
[Red] No rockets.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.666
Make sure
Laserpigeon's cyber parts stay intact,

13:18.666 --> 13:20.458
so the boss can reinstall them.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.666
[Yellow] You mean reinstall on you.

13:22.666 --> 13:24.291
[Red] Yes. No! N-- That's not the point.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.541
[Violet] I was just asking myself.
Can I get the arm?

13:26.541 --> 13:28.208
[Red] No, you cannot get the arm!

13:28.208 --> 13:30.250
Is it too much to ask
to focus on the mission?!

13:30.250 --> 13:32.958
You know, I never really got
the whole rainbow thing.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.041
Yeah.

13:35.625 --> 13:36.833
Me neither.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.083

14:40.625 --> 14:43.083

[metal bangs]

15:10.041 --> 15:10.875
[Dolph grunts]

15:18.333 --> 15:21.500
You didn't need to fight
the whole gummy bear gestapo.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.333
[Dolph] I had to know you'd be safe.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.625
Otherwise, this is worth nothing.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.500
[Alex sighs] That's sweet of you.

15:30.666 --> 15:33.666
But seriously,
you didn't need to fight them.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.958
- There is no happy ending to this.
- [Dolph grunts]

15:39.666 --> 15:43.500
My source had a price
in exchange for giving me the location.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.208
The codec... for you.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.416
[Dolph] What?

15:47.416 --> 15:50.750
You gave me up... for money?

15:51.708 --> 15:54.250
[sighs] It's not nearly that simple.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.250
This is bigger than you and me, Dolph.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.583
The revolution must happen.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.875
None of us are free until Eden falls,

16:00.875 --> 16:03.333
and this gives me
everything I need to make it.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.125
[Dolph grunts]

16:08.125 --> 16:09.541
Those plans we made,

16:10.125 --> 16:12.750
leaving Eden together,
that was just the job, right?

16:13.666 --> 16:15.458
You were always gonna turn me in.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.916
I do love you, but...

16:19.125 --> 16:22.333
the cause is worth any sacrifice.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.250
[Dolph chuckles]

16:25.250 --> 16:27.083
Hell of an apocalypse
we're having, right?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.875
- Can you please stop that?
- [wrestler grunts]

16:54.875 --> 16:57.333
- I'm trying to focus.
- You got a problem, pig face?

16:57.333 --> 16:58.416
Guys, look!

16:59.125 --> 17:00.375
[Dolph grunting]

17:00.375 --> 17:01.625
Here. Let me help you.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.875
Hey! Don't you fucking touch--

17:03.875 --> 17:06.916
[muttering]

17:07.708 --> 17:09.000
[chuckles] Sorry.

17:09.000 --> 17:09.958
I'm Jade.

17:09.958 --> 17:12.291
- And this is Pey'j, my uncle.
- [Pey'j] Okay. I'm all right.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.583
[Jade] Oh yeah. The genius over there is--

17:14.583 --> 17:16.625
Hey! I'm Cody Rhodes!

17:16.625 --> 17:19.083
And I'm supposed to be fighting
for the championship tomorrow!

17:19.083 --> 17:21.750
And you're Captain Dolph Laserhawk,

17:21.750 --> 17:24.791
ex-Eden special op
and now public enemy number two.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.208
Smile.

17:27.708 --> 17:28.791
Or don't.

17:28.791 --> 17:29.916
Where are we?

17:29.916 --> 17:32.458
I don't know.
We just woke up here like you did.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.000
I think we were drugged or something.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.208
- Huh?
- [Pey'j] Jesus!

17:37.208 --> 17:38.625
[ancient music playing]

17:38.625 --> 17:40.750
[hooded figure] I can feel
the blood of my Brotherhood

17:40.750 --> 17:42.333
trying to say something to me.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.375
We are here for a reason.

17:45.125 --> 17:48.416
Our memories live on past us,
embedded in the DNA of our ancestors.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.916
That's a fucking frog.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.208
[Dolph] Yeah. That's a frog.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.583
Yes. I'm a frog, all right?

17:52.583 --> 17:54.625
But, uh... First and foremost,

17:54.625 --> 17:57.333
I am from the Brotherhood
of the Assassins.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.791
My name is Bull--

17:58.791 --> 18:01.083
[retching]

18:01.083 --> 18:03.125
- Jesus!
- [Dolph] That's a strange name.

18:05.041 --> 18:08.083
Wait. Wait, look.
There's something in there.

18:09.041 --> 18:13.291
Oh my God. This is the Supermaxx.
Does this mean we are actually in the--

18:13.291 --> 18:15.625
[alarm blaring]

18:18.416 --> 18:20.500
I sense that an enemy approaches.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.041
Yeah. We kinda get that too.

18:22.041 --> 18:26.708
Okay, cool. We got numbers on our side.
It's our best shot at escaping this pit.

18:26.708 --> 18:28.125
You move on my signal.

18:28.958 --> 18:29.958
[blaring stops]

18:31.916 --> 18:36.291
[footsteps approaching]

18:39.208 --> 18:41.708
I am the Warden of Supermaxx,

18:41.708 --> 18:43.791
and I've got three things to say to you.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.791
Number one.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.250
- You're my--
- Now! [yelling]

18:48.250 --> 18:49.333
[device activates]

18:55.625 --> 18:58.041
Okay. I'm gonna skip
right to number three, I guess.

18:58.041 --> 19:02.125
Yeah, you got a bomb in your brain.
And you do shit like that, boom.

19:03.250 --> 19:06.333
So, back to number one.
You're my prisoners.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.666
I brought you together
because you each possess a unique quality.

19:10.416 --> 19:14.083
Number two. To the world outside,
you don't exist anymore.

19:14.083 --> 19:18.625
Congratulations. You're now
my new special team of operatives.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.166
If that's what this is,
go ahead and execute me.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.625
I'd rather be a corpse
than work for Eden again.

19:24.625 --> 19:28.583
Oh, a shame. I thought you'd be interested
in finding that boyfriend of yours.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.958
[Dolph] What do you know?

19:31.958 --> 19:34.666
Speak. Now

19:35.291 --> 19:37.791
[Warden] Well, if you shoot now,
you'll never find out, will you?

19:38.500 --> 19:39.708
[Dolph grumbles]

19:39.708 --> 19:41.041
[Warden] Don't you worry.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.166
You won't be working for Eden.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.625
You'll be working for me.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.500
[rock music playing]
