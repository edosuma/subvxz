00:01.601 --> 00:03.769
    It's not what
    it looks like, mama.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.672
            Actually, mandy,
            it's exactly what
            it looks like.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.939
What's gonna happen
to us?

00:07.942 --> 00:10.609
            If you're smart,
            you'll say nothing.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.543
Please don't go.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.078
        There has been
        no one but you.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.981
Hannah: If joe were alive,
he would have contacted you.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.549
        Maybe there was a reason
        that he couldn't.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.019
            The fbi raided
            a follower
            safe house,

00:20.021 --> 00:23.322
            Killed 5 people,
            arrested a sixth.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.957
            The ones from
            the subway are
            still out there.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.259
    Man on tv: Killer twins.
    That's the breaking
    news today...

00:27.261 --> 00:28.827
        You guys have been made.

00:28.829 --> 00:29.628
    It was inevitable.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.196
    ...Eluded authorities
    at a charity gala,

00:31.198 --> 00:33.432
    Where they brutally stabbed
        a male guest.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.567
    Carlos: It's emma.
    She keeps calling.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.235
            Hello?

00:36.237 --> 00:38.270
    Meet me in person.
    Just come alone.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.172
Whoa, whoa. Stop.
What are you doing?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.573
            Is joe alive?

00:41.575 --> 00:42.241
    Yes.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.542
            So you planned
            these murders to

00:43.544 --> 00:44.910
            Lure joe out
            of hiding.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.345
            Judy:
            Mandy, stab him!

00:46.347 --> 00:48.113
            Stab him, honey.
            Do it!

00:48.115 --> 00:51.717
    I'm sorry, mama,
    but I can't let joe go.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.252
            Ryan: I have to
            say good-bye.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.553
            -Why?
    -For your own safety.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.321
    Ryan: What train is that?
    Mike: Express train.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.723
Why didn't she
get on it?

00:57.725 --> 00:59.158
Lily's lying.
She's in on it.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.326
    Mike on radio: 10-0.
    Lily might be compromised.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.195
        Ryan: Why go through
        so much trouble
        to get close to me?

01:03.197 --> 01:05.164
Lily: You're important
to joe, so you're
important to me.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.100
I see why joe's
so drawn to you.
Good-bye, ryan.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.368
            Luke: What happened?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.235
Just drive, dear.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.371
            Yes, mother.
            Of course.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.809
Mandy, voice-over:
I believe in you, joe.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.978
            Girl: I want
            chocolate milk!

01:19.980 --> 01:22.648
    That's how you want to
    spend your sugar allowance?

01:22.650 --> 01:23.682
            Chocolate milk!

01:23.684 --> 01:27.352
    Ok. It's your choice.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.121
    Slow down there, monkey.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.091
[giggling]

01:36.429 --> 01:37.496
        Good morning!

01:37.498 --> 01:40.599
Woman: Hi, jana!

01:40.601 --> 01:42.334
            She looks nice.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.136
    Yes.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.240
Yes, she does.

01:49.576 --> 01:53.679
Hey! Where did you
get that sucker?

01:53.681 --> 01:54.813
            The man.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.581
Who?

01:55.583 --> 01:58.984
Did you go
in the cabinet?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.954
        Where's billy?

02:01.956 --> 02:03.288
Andrea, did you take
him out?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.690
Where's your brother?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.525
            The man did.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.362
Honey, what man?

02:10.364 --> 02:14.133
            The man who talks
            funny.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.539
Uh, andrea honey,
look at me.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.207
Where's billy?

02:22.209 --> 02:24.276
            Andrea!

02:25.612 --> 02:27.880
        Honey? Billy?

02:27.882 --> 02:30.649
        Billy? Billy?

02:31.651 --> 02:35.387
        Billy?
        Billy, honey?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.189
            Bill--

02:49.135 --> 02:53.138
            Please don't
            hurt my son!

02:55.375 --> 02:59.678
        Children are such
        precious gifts,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.147
    Aren't they, jana?

03:10.156 --> 03:12.224
            [clang]

03:12.792 --> 03:16.895
    Joe, you're alive!

03:16.897 --> 03:20.165
            Joe! Ohh!

03:20.167 --> 03:23.202
            Where have you been?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.208
Lily gray is
the primary suspect

03:29.210 --> 03:30.976
In the murder
of two federal agents

03:30.978 --> 03:32.277
At her soho art gallery.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.613
We also are now viewing her
as a person of interest

03:34.615 --> 03:36.148
In the recent
subway slayings.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.650
        Tell us about the raid
        in burlington.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.219
        Is she linked to that
        group at all?

03:40.221 --> 03:41.954
We have yet to confirm
that connection.

03:41.956 --> 03:45.757
The raid resulted
in 5 casualties
and one arrest...

03:45.759 --> 03:46.992
            Have you eaten?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.660
            You need to eat.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.561
No. I'm good.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.230
Mendez: ...Asking
the public at this time

03:51.232 --> 03:53.432
If you know any--

03:53.666 --> 03:54.833
            Why was she
            targeting you?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.435
I'm the guy that
brought joe down.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.536
            But if she's
            a part of it,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.037
            Why would she
            put herself
            in the subway?

03:59.039 --> 04:01.373
She made herself
the victim to get
close to me.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.741
Those were superficial
wounds, max.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.344
She knows my background,
she knows my history
with the case,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.579
How I get too attached
to the victims.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.514
            Sarah fuller,
            claire matthews.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.682
She was playing a part.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.618
            This woman has no
            violent history,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.920
            No record, not even
            a traffic ticket.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.622
            She's an art dealer.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.957
            Why would
            she do this?

04:21.127 --> 04:22.894
To lure him out.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.231
            Who? Luring who out?

04:28.735 --> 04:33.972
            Joe carroll because
            he's still alive.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.612
            Well, if that's
            what's happening,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.347
            Then you need
            to prove it.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.783
            How can I help?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.119
Oh, no. Uh-uh.
Fbi is all over me.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.354
I'm being trailed.
They know you've
been helping me,

04:49.356 --> 04:50.555
So they're watching
you, too--

04:50.557 --> 04:52.124
Our cell phones,
our online activity.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.692
            Ryan, I work
            at the nypd
            intel division,

04:53.694 --> 04:56.128
            I trained with
            the best cia techs
            at the academy.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.330
            Do you honestly
            think that they
            can trace anything

04:58.332 --> 04:59.364
            I do online?

04:59.366 --> 05:00.866
Yeah, I do.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.334
            Well, maybe
            they can,

05:02.336 --> 05:03.769
            But it will take
            them 6 months.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.903
            I know how
            to bury it,

05:04.905 --> 05:06.338
            And pick up some
            disposable phones--

05:06.340 --> 05:07.639
You don't even believe
joe is alive.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.741
        I'm skeptical.
        There's a difference.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.977
I can't let you
lose your job over me.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.178
            I'm not gonna
            lose my job,

05:13.180 --> 05:14.579
            And so what
            if I did?

05:14.581 --> 05:15.981
            You, aunt jenny
            in boca, and me.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.582
            That's
            the hardy clan.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.850
            That's all there is.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.286
            There's no one else.

05:29.929 --> 05:34.466
            You know, um,
            until last year,

05:34.468 --> 05:36.635
            We hadn't
            said 5 words
            to each other

05:36.637 --> 05:39.638
            Since my dad died,

05:39.640 --> 05:43.608
            And I feel like
            you and me,

05:43.610 --> 05:48.180
            Dad would have liked
            this version of us.

05:48.182 --> 05:52.884
            So you don't get to
            decide what I do.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.689
If something happened
to you,

05:57.691 --> 06:00.025
That would end me.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.061
            Now you know
            how I feel.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.565
    Woman: Come on, hannah.
    What about emma hill?

06:06.567 --> 06:09.234
    What can you tell me
    about emma hill?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.802
    Do you know lily gray?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.971
    Tell me what you know
    about lily gray.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.108
        Is emma hill
        with lily gray?

06:16.110 --> 06:16.975
    Are they together?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.744
7 hours.
That's the best it got.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.379
            She'll break
            eventually.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.847
        All right.
    What about lily gray?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.515
            Well, we've only
            had a few hours,

06:23.517 --> 06:24.750
            But here's what
            we know.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.817
            Lily gray was
            born in denmark.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.918
She was orphaned
at a young age.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.286
She was taken in
by martin jansen,

06:28.288 --> 06:30.822
A wealthy businessman
who died when lily
was in college.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.157
Now she's the sole
beneficiary.

06:32.159 --> 06:35.127
She inherited all
businesses, properties,
holdings,

06:35.129 --> 06:35.961
All on the up and up.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.262
        This woman is
        a millionaire?

06:37.264 --> 06:39.030
            Billionaire.
            Estimated
            net worth 1.4.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.298
            Hopkins, what else
            you got?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.567
Her assets are controlled by
banks in belize and anguilla.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.436
You now how helpful
their privacy laws are.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.872
            Now money is
            not the most
            interesting thing

06:46.874 --> 06:47.773
            About this woman.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.207
            Hilda barkov,
            a russian
            housekeeper

06:49.209 --> 06:50.509
            Who maintained
            her father's
            estates,

06:50.511 --> 06:51.643
            She died giving
            birth to twin boys.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.378
    Lily's gray's
    the adoptive mother?

06:53.380 --> 06:54.679
    Lawrence: There's
    no record of adoption.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.882
        There's no record
        of the boys after
        their birth.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.617
    Well, hoe does one
    raise twin boys

06:58.619 --> 06:59.985
    And nobody knows
    about it?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.586
    Did you guys interview
    everyone in her life?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.389
Yes. Those closest
include her gallery
assistant kimmy lee.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.725
Surprisingly stupid.
She knows a great deal
of nothing.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.160
        And her business
        partner david roland,

07:08.162 --> 07:10.295
        Who was released
        from the hospital
        this morning.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.897
    All right. Well, the twins
    attacked him at the gallery,

07:11.899 --> 07:13.598
        But that does not
    rule out his involvement.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.034
He lawyered up.
Doesn't want to
come in voluntarily.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.470
Court order's
in the works.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.882
Lily: It's a late season.

07:30.884 --> 07:34.119
Everything's
still so green.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.156
            I missed
            this place.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.158
How long do we
have to stay here?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.426
            Don't be
            a downer, dear.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.195
I'm not a downer.
I'm being realistic.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.364
We don't even know
that joe's gonna call.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.333
    He'll call.

07:48.335 --> 07:53.205
I'm more concerned
we have the proper
response when he does.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.641
You shouldn't have
killed carlos.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.809
            Yeah. It's
            all my fault.

07:57.811 --> 08:03.114
We need to provide joe
with a sense of security, ok?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.551
Can emma hill
be trusted?

08:06.553 --> 08:08.787
            Talk to mark.
            He's convinced

08:08.789 --> 08:11.656
            We traded a pawn
            for a queen.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.091
Mark: Mom!

08:13.093 --> 08:15.527
        Oh, sweetie! Oh!

08:15.529 --> 08:16.962
You ok?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.363
        Careful. My arm.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.030
            Oh, sorry.

08:19.032 --> 08:23.468
Oh, baby.
I missed you so much.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.838
        Where's giselle?
        I thought she was
        coming with you.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.074
Oh, no.
She's back in town
taking care of david

08:29.076 --> 08:31.009
            Since luke
            failed to do so
            at the museum.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.511
    Actually, mark failed
    to do so, mother.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.347
Really?

08:35.349 --> 08:37.948
    I specifically remember
    tasking you with that.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.049
Why's david so important?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.284
He doesn't know
anything.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.020
        Well, I'd rather
    the fbi not question him,

08:42.022 --> 08:44.489
    But let's leave giselle
    to that, hmm? Yeah?

08:44.491 --> 08:46.858
            -Yeah.
            -Good!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.059
        Lily: We're here!

08:48.061 --> 08:49.961
            Yeah. Finally!

Ohh! He speaks english!

09:11.918 --> 09:13.385
        Very good.

09:24.730 --> 09:29.100
    Me, too. So are we liking
        the states?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.703
    Yeah? Is it everything
    I promised it would be?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.338
                Oui, oui.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.139
            You kids!

09:34.141 --> 09:36.841
        You bring me
        so much joy.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.247
            Emma.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.916
    Hi.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.117
Why are you
hiding back here?

09:46.119 --> 09:51.690
Come! We are so privileged
to have you with us.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.327
I'm sure you're
a little overwhelmed,

09:55.329 --> 09:58.196
But this is my family,

09:58.198 --> 10:02.367
And you're so welcome.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.970
You're so welcome here.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.547
            You're pretty.

10:15.549 --> 10:16.615
    Oh.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.250
Your house is pretty.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.755
            It's so big.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.391
What do you want
to play now?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.360
            Let's play wedding.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.295
Um, ok.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.398
        Mandy's a sweet girl.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.966
        Her skirt's too short.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.134
        It's not proper at all.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.303
Well, she comes from
a home of few resources

10:38.305 --> 10:42.440
And even fewer
proper role models.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.341
            Her mom?

10:43.343 --> 10:46.311
Sadly no longer with us.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.949
            Joe, I was here,
            I waited,

10:50.951 --> 10:53.251
            And you
            never showed.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.219
I took a detour.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.254
            A detour? Roderick
            said that you were
            gonna come to me.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.522
            I had it all set up.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.690
            What happened?

10:58.692 --> 11:02.527
Look. It's--it's
a very long story, jana,

11:02.529 --> 11:08.133
And I assume we're
on limited time. Yes?

11:11.337 --> 11:14.039
            I know what you
            came for.

11:48.407 --> 11:49.708
Woman on tv: Who is lily gray?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.376
    That is the question
    authorities are asking

11:51.378 --> 11:54.145
    This morning as she
    remains at large.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.780
Considered armed and dangerous,

11:55.782 --> 11:58.216
    Miss gray killed
    two federal agents

11:58.218 --> 11:59.451
    And eluded authorities

11:59.453 --> 12:01.786
At her soho gallery yesterday.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.255
From well-respected art dealer
    to murder suspect,

12:04.257 --> 12:06.958
    Miss gray is now believed
        to be involved

12:06.960 --> 12:08.526
    In the recent carroll cult
        murder spree.

12:08.528 --> 12:12.564
However, our sources tell us
that the fbi is still struggling

12:12.566 --> 12:15.066
To find miss gray's connection
        to carroll

12:15.068 --> 12:16.601
    And his former cult members,

12:16.603 --> 12:22.140
    But we do know is that
    death toll continues to
    rise in new york city,

12:22.142 --> 12:24.142
    And miss gray is
    a wanted fugitive.

12:24.144 --> 12:28.079
    Anyone with any inforamation
        regarding miss gray

12:28.081 --> 12:30.215
        Should contact--

12:30.217 --> 12:32.417
Someone out there?

12:38.023 --> 12:40.158
    Authorities also
    continue to search

12:40.160 --> 12:42.160
    For the still unnamed
        twin brothers,

12:42.162 --> 12:46.798
    Who are believed to be
    responsible for several
    of the recent mudrers.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.468
    While joe carroll has been
    dead for over a year now,

12:50.470 --> 12:51.870
    It has become
    painfully apparent

12:51.872 --> 12:57.075
To the people of new york city
that his legacy lives on.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.245
    We will continue to unravel
        more of the mystery

13:00.247 --> 13:01.446

        david's cooperation,
        show me your warrant

13:08.388 --> 13:09.788
        Or grant him
        full immunity.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.389
            And if a killer
            gets away
            in the meantime,

13:11.391 --> 13:12.757
            That's ok with you?

13:12.759 --> 13:14.793

    the warrant take 8th.

Well, they're tailing me,
so, yeah,

13:35.816 --> 13:37.582
But they didn't
invite me here.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.785

lawyer stonewall mendez.

13:40.787 --> 13:41.786

13:41.788 --> 13:43.521
I don't think
he's inside.

        en route.

No. Too easy.

lisa withers' credit card.

a room anyplace.

            any evidence?

smarter than that.

            Are you
            threatening me?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.864
Look. I'm ryan's friend.
If I wasn't,

17:46.866 --> 17:48.132
I'd be talking
to your captain right now.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.767
        Want to talk to him?
        He loves the fbi.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.503
Look. This is
about revenge for ryan.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.439
Now he's hurt
and traumatized,

17:54.441 --> 17:55.873
And he is grieving
over claire,

17:55.875 --> 17:59.310
But you and I both know
joe carroll is dead.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.614
Are you gonna be ok
when ryan gets
himself killed?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.583
I know death runs
in the hardy family--

18:05.585 --> 18:08.519
            Ok. We're done.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.562
I'm trying to help.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.441
It was good to
meet you, max.

        [door slams]

18:43.622 --> 18:45.289
            Emma.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.626
            Emma, I want you
            to know you're
            safe here.

18:57.669 --> 19:00.738
            It's beautiful,
            isn't it,

19:00.740 --> 19:04.175
            Peaceful, scenic?

19:04.177 --> 19:09.180
            See that dramatic
            contrast between
            shadow and light?

19:09.182 --> 19:14.585
            It's a wonderful
            place to paint.
            It really is.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.288
I understand
you're an artist.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.957
        Not really.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.060
            Maybe we
            can change that.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.428
            I want us
            to be friends.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.964
Because when joe calls,
you want me to tell him
that it's safe here.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.034
            I want you to tell
            him the truth.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.869
What is the truth
exactly?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.872
            Ask me anything
            you want.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.920
Can you tell me
anything about joey?

19:48.922 --> 19:51.622
        Your son is deep
        in witness protection
        with his grandmother.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.291
There's no way we can
find an address then?

19:53.293 --> 19:57.862
        I'll keep trying.
        I'll get something.
        I always do.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.641
            I held onto it.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.276
        Money, credit card,
        I.D.S,

20:12.278 --> 20:14.912
        Everything you needed
        to start your new life.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.981
I assume you still
have access

20:16.983 --> 20:18.649
To certain information.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.550
            Of course.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.920
Someone's
reached out to me.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.089
            A follower?

20:26.526 --> 20:32.063
Only a slight few
know how to leave
a message for me.

20:32.065 --> 20:35.433
I need to know if it's
safe for me to answer.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.636
Emma: You have
quite a diverse family.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.372
            Discards from
            across the globe,

20:41.374 --> 20:43.808
            Kids whom no one
            wanted,

20:43.810 --> 20:47.378
            Displaced by
            violence or neglect.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.381
            I used to be
            one of them.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.683
You?

20:52.685 --> 20:53.918
            My father killed
            my mother,

20:53.920 --> 20:56.187
            And then he took
            his own life
            when I was a child.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.822
            My mother was
            a maid,

20:57.824 --> 20:59.390
        And he was convinced
        I was the progeny

20:59.392 --> 21:01.892
        Of her wealthy employer
        martin jansen.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.262
        He thought
        they had an affair.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.097
Was it true?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.298
            Maybe.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.033
        After they died,
        martin took care of me,

21:09.035 --> 21:10.401
        Sent me to
        the best schools,

21:10.403 --> 21:11.702
        Bought me anything
        I desired,

21:11.704 --> 21:15.039
        But he was--
        he was never a parent.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.911
        I think you know
        what that's like,

21:20.913 --> 21:24.849
        To grow bereft
        of a parent's love.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.685
You've done
your research?

21:30.255 --> 21:31.789
        I know your mother
        didn't love you

21:31.791 --> 21:34.525
        The way you
        needed her to.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.470
            That's behind me.

21:50.142 --> 21:54.445
I think she didn't
see your strength,

21:54.447 --> 21:57.515
Your intelligence,
your beauty.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.883
If I had a daughter
like you,

21:58.885 --> 22:01.485
I'd...I'd honor her.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.954
            Why have you been
            looking for joe?

22:03.956 --> 22:04.955
            Do you know him?

22:04.957 --> 22:06.257
I feel like I do.

22:06.259 --> 22:09.994
Early on, I could see
that luke and mark
were different,

22:09.996 --> 22:13.064
And other mothers
might have tried
to change that,

22:13.066 --> 22:16.767
But I chose to love them
for exactly who they are,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.803
And I surrounded them
with a family

22:18.805 --> 22:22.106
Of like-minded souls.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.175
            That's what joe did
            for us.

22:24.177 --> 22:30.348
That's why I feel
so connected to him, to you.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.718
Isn't that really
all you need to know?

    can and will be used

        She thinks this is
        all about her.

27:11.897 --> 27:12.830
No. She was emotional.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.313
            And that is why
            she had to die.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.515
            Now miss jana
            wants to help us.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.250
            She's our friend.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.554
            You do see
            the difference,
            don't you?

29:17.556 --> 29:20.324
I guess.

29:20.326 --> 29:25.062
        You know, mandy,
        death is a...

29:25.064 --> 29:27.397
        It's a precious gift.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.500
        It can't be given
        indiscriminately,

29:29.502 --> 29:30.601
        Or it loses its value,

29:30.603 --> 29:35.105
        And we lose
        the great privilege
        of offering it.

29:35.107 --> 29:40.110
        Your mama, she gave us
        no choice.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.311
Jana: Here's what I have.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.848
Um...There are
several contacts,

29:44.850 --> 29:49.887
But I have no idea
if they're still valid.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.189
This was all
roderick's doing.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.691
        No. Of course.
        Thank you.

29:54.693 --> 29:57.394

    I'm here for you
    when you need anything.

30:03.335 --> 30:08.972

Ryan: Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.780
        Where are you?
        I found the car.

30:49.782 --> 30:52.149
    It's parked outside
    grand central station.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.551

    of a woman leaving it.

31:20.345 --> 31:23.447
            Hi. Can I have
            a table, that one
            over there?

31:23.449 --> 31:25.349
            -Sure.
            -Thanks.

31:38.496 --> 31:39.863
            Ryan: It's like
            I told you.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.331
            I knew the lawyer
            would be
            stonewalling,

31:41.333 --> 31:42.299
            So I went
            from there.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.701
            The york avenue
            apartment was
            easy to find.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.405
Are we keeping you?

31:48.407 --> 31:49.206

            ryan.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.710
        Mr. Hardy,
        what would you do

31:53.712 --> 31:55.679
        If you were
        in my position?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.014
            Do I slap
        your wrist again,

31:57.016 --> 31:58.181
        Or do I bring
        the d.A. In here

31:58.183 --> 31:59.449

31:59.451 --> 32:00.684

        possible way.

            with you.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.395
    They will kill you.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.463

It was stolen.

        at a table, she's
        reading a magazine.
