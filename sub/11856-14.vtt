WEBVTT

00:15.208 --> 00:19.083
Aw, jeez.
What a beautiful cake.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.583
Could've done without
the candles, though.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.917
[chuckles]
Oh, baloney, when you were a
kid

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
you couldn't wait to
blow out the candles.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.375
Yeah, back then,
there weren't 30 of them.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.583
Oh, go on, Ro, make a wish.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.542
Go, go, go, go! Get down!

00:38.375 --> 00:39.542
What did you wish for?

00:39.625 --> 00:41.792
I can't say, or
it won't come true.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.417
Oh, look who likes
being the kid now.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.083
Okay, but don't laugh.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.709
I wished I'd win the lotto.

00:49.792 --> 00:53.000
Then I could take
a cruise, go on safari

00:53.083 --> 00:54.000
travel to Greece

00:54.083 --> 00:55.709
travel the world.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.125
I think your wish
was perfect, Ro.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.959
And now

01:03.041 --> 01:04.458
you'll be ready

01:04.542 --> 01:05.583
'for anything.'

01:05.667 --> 01:07.250
'Oh, Terri.'

01:12.250 --> 01:14.542
'And don't you dare
say they aren't you.'

01:14.625 --> 01:15.959
You can't afford these.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.625
Oh, the store gives me half-off.

01:17.709 --> 01:20.291
Come on!

01:21.500 --> 01:24.000
- Sorry, Ro, I do have to
run.
- Oh.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.250
You sure you
don't
wanna come out?

01:27.625 --> 01:28.792
You're sweet, I can't.

01:28.875 --> 01:30.625
Tomorrow, I have to
be at work first thing.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.083
Oh.

01:43.834 --> 01:45.166
Let me see your hands!

01:45.250 --> 01:46.917
Back away from the alarms!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.458
Go! Do it now!

01:49.542 --> 01:51.208
You, get down on the ground!

02:33.625 --> 02:35.208
Got something off the teletype.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.792
Robbery at Emerson bank
this morning, southeast
branch.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.291
- Big heist?
- All told, $300,000.

02:40.375 --> 02:42.375
Robbery have something
to do with a homicide?

02:42.458 --> 02:44.208
Nick and I caught
a case six years back.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.917
Lady teller was
killed during a
hold-up.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.417
Same branch.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.834
Bank gettin' hit twice
makes it the same crew?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.250
Well, these guys were
wearing Johnny Cash masks

02:53.333 --> 02:54.834
just like six years ago.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.375
(Vera)
'Plus, this crew was
armed with sawed-off'

02:56.458 --> 02:58.083
pump-action shotguns,
same as last time.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.917
So catch who took
down today's score

03:00.000 --> 03:01.583
and we put down your old case.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.583
If I remember right, the
victim
was a real wallflower type.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.291
Minding her own business.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.750
Right. Wrong place.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.750
- Wrong time.
- Sad.

03:09.834 --> 03:14.125
Soon as they shot her, armed
robbery became murder one.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.750
There you are.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.000
Hey, you been looking for me?

03:17.083 --> 03:19.709
Not me, uh, some dude
on a Harley.

03:19.792 --> 03:20.792
Oh?

03:20.875 --> 03:22.709
Yeah, Ray, something-or-other.

03:25.709 --> 03:27.000
Oh.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.083
Well, it must be
something personal.

03:35.542 --> 03:38.000
I'm just saying.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.458
Guy on a Harley, always sexy.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.041
Sure there's nothing
you want to share, Lil?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.250
Yeah, he shows up again

03:47.333 --> 03:49.375
tell him I'm dead.

04:29.166 --> 04:32.792
Roween Ryan,
30 years, three weeks.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.667
Died from a shotgun
blast to the chest.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.542
Johnny Cash crew, three
in all, was never
identified.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.875
But one of them
had a nickname.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.667
- The Hat.
- The Hat?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.667
How one Johnny Cash was
overheard referring to
another.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.500
According to a fellow bank
teller, Darla Dunaway

04:45.583 --> 04:47.000
they were warned not to
press the silent alarm.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.667
- 'Roween did it anyway.'
- Brave lady.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.166
Sticks her neck out in
the name of what's right.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.166
Hmm. Don't see that every day.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.208
- Prints?
- Uh, three lifts.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.500
- Never got a hook on 'em.
- 'I'll grab Scotty.'

04:57.583 --> 05:00.208
Go tell Roween's family
we're re-opening the case.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.875
You and Will hit the bank,
see what's what with the FBI.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.208
Playing second fiddle
to the feds, fun times.

05:05.291 --> 05:09.166
Probably rolling out
the red carpet as we speak.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.083
(Jeffries)
'Darla, you were a
teller five years ago'

05:18.166 --> 05:19.750
when the bank was
robbed the first
time?

05:19.834 --> 05:22.083
I got my start at
the window next to Ro's.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.375
Worked my way up
to branch manager.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.208
Today marks my
one-month
anniversary.

05:27.291 --> 05:30.542
- Supposed to have cake.
- Instead, you got robbed.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.750
Like déjà vu.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.250
Three men in Johnny Cash masks

05:34.333 --> 05:37.542
half-hour before opening, they
overpowered the security guard.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.625
(Vera)
'Is there anything
you can tell us?'

05:39.709 --> 05:41.875
Maybe something
one of them
said?

05:41.959 --> 05:43.417
It was just a lot of yelling.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.166
Any other details
make an impression?

05:47.250 --> 05:49.625
[sighs]
I wasn't gonna do
this.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.875
Do what? Here, have a seat.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.000
See, it's flimsy, but I think

05:56.083 --> 05:57.291
I sort of got
a look at one of
them.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.917
I thought they
were wearing masks.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.959
Yeah, but the one
who held the gun on me

06:02.041 --> 06:04.917
on his pinky finger,
he had a skull ring.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.250
- I recognized it.
- Okay.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.583
Before the first robbery, say..

06:09.667 --> 06:11.792
...two weeks, a man
came into the bank.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.834
I remember, because he went
to Ro's window instead of
mine.

06:16.083 --> 06:19.291
I was sort of competitive
in those days.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.500
Next.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.959
Uh, $50 cashier's check, please.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.792
There's a two-dollar
service charge.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.041
Alright, you're worth it.

06:39.375 --> 06:40.709
Just joking you.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.291
Enjoy romance and
adventure, Roween?

06:49.375 --> 06:52.959
- What?
- The book you're reading.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.959
Oh, I guess.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.458
I like everything.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.375
What about a decent place
to have lunch around here?

07:00.458 --> 07:01.875
Oh, the Soft Shoe Cafe.

07:01.959 --> 07:05.375
It's a little eatery up the
street. I go there all the
time.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.291
I may have passed by,
uh,
art deco place?

07:08.375 --> 07:09.333
Yeah.

07:10.709 --> 07:13.000
It's been there since the '40s.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.208
Makes you feel like
you just stepped

07:15.291 --> 07:17.041
into one of those
old-time movie pictures.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.000
[chuckles]
Known for their
pastrami sandwich.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.500
Sit up at the
fountain or a booth?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.208
Fountain.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.500
Make sure you treat yourself

07:24.583 --> 07:27.083
to the velvet
ice cream for
dessert.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.083
Hey, gal, can I
borrow a scrunchie?

07:31.583 --> 07:33.250
Um...okay.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.834
- Sure.
- You're a doll.

07:40.917 --> 07:44.417
Hey, you should come to Zebra
tonight. We're going dancing.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.625
And, uh, bring
your cutie-pie friend.

07:52.792 --> 07:55.458
Sign...here.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.291
Pastrami, huh?

08:07.917 --> 08:10.500
Almost hot in
a bad boy sort of way.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.834
You see the skull
ring he was wearing?

08:12.917 --> 08:15.291
Uh, didn't notice.
I just thought he was nice.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.542
What's his name?

08:17.625 --> 08:19.875
Julius.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.458
Julius what?

08:22.542 --> 08:25.000
Sorry, Darla, you know
I can't tell you that.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.041
When I saw that
skull ring today

08:34.125 --> 08:37.375
I knew it had to
be him, this Julius.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.917
And you never learned
his last name?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.792
For me, it was always
about one-upping Ro.

08:43.875 --> 08:46.750
I was pretty awful back then.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.417
Maybe you're making up
for it now.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.333
This is, uh, Roween's bedroom.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.250
I left it just the way it was.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.542
(Valens)
'It's nice.'

09:03.625 --> 09:06.417
Don't let Terri
hear you say that.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.959
Your other daughter?

09:08.041 --> 09:11.125
Says I need to start using
the room for something else.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.291
It'll help me move on.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.959
I say, different strokes.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.125
These your daughters here?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.500
Oh, always loved that picture.

09:19.583 --> 09:23.083
Their faces smushed up
against one another.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.625
Two kinds of sisters.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.291
Sounds like yours were
the kind that got along.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.291
(Mary)
'Roween was shy, loved to
read.'

09:30.375 --> 09:33.792
Whereas Terri was
more the glamour girl.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.792
So your daughters
always lived at home then?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.583
Oh, not Terri.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.625
The boys were crazy for her.
She couldn't wait to leave.

09:40.709 --> 09:41.792
'But Ro's calendar'

09:41.875 --> 09:43.792
wasn't as full.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.709
Why the timing of
her death was so tragic.

09:46.792 --> 09:49.083
Because she never had a chance
to find someone special?

09:49.166 --> 09:51.333
No, I think she
had found someone.

09:51.417 --> 09:54.834
I even heard her gushy
on the phone one night.

09:54.917 --> 09:57.667
Ask me, she was in love.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.917
(Roween over phone)
'I did.'

09:59.000 --> 10:02.166
I read the autobiography.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.500
June adored Johnny.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.500
He never would've
survived without
her.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.125
Mother.

10:11.208 --> 10:14.583
- What are you doing?
- I was-I was getting some
tea.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.291
I gotta go.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.458
Yes, it's on then.

10:22.542 --> 10:23.792
Friday.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.500
'8:30.'

10:25.583 --> 10:28.875
[chuckling]
Bye.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.041
Who were you talking to?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.542
No one, just a friend.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.417
A friend, huh?
And where is this
friend

10:34.500 --> 10:36.625
taking you on Friday night?

10:36.709 --> 10:38.875
Mom, have you lost weight?

10:38.959 --> 10:40.709
Alright, you two, I'm off.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.542
Thanks for dinner.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.583
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.500
Uh, hold your horses.

10:46.583 --> 10:49.000
Roween was on
the phone with a man.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.041
- Really?
- 'Don't give me that jazz.'

10:51.125 --> 10:55.000
I have a sneaky idea you
know exactly who it is.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.333
Mom, have you lost weight?

10:59.041 --> 11:02.208
How is it I suffer
18 hours of labor with you two

11:02.291 --> 11:04.625
and now, when it comes
time for a mother to reap

11:04.709 --> 11:07.166
the small joys of motherhood

11:07.250 --> 11:09.333
this mother gets cut out?

11:17.834 --> 11:20.083
Sounds like your girls
could keep a secret.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.250
Thick as thieves.

11:23.333 --> 11:27.667
Roween mentioned she was
reading
about, uh, June and Johnny.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.834
Was that June Carter
and Johnny Cash?

11:29.917 --> 11:31.792
Johnny Cash was
one of her favorites.

11:31.875 --> 11:35.709
The bank robbers wore
Johnny Cash masks.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.083
Well, there's
a coincidence for you.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.917
Ro also mentioned something

11:40.000 --> 11:42.208
about 8:30 on Friday, right?

11:42.291 --> 11:43.583
Yes.

11:43.667 --> 11:48.083
The time the bank was robbed,
8:30. On the dot.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.917
Mrs. Ryan, did you ever get
them
to tell you who that guy was?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.959
Who it was Ro was
supposed to meet at 8:30?

11:54.041 --> 11:57.000
It-It took some doing, but, yes.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.083
His-his name was Julius.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.542
You've been smokin' 'em up
pretty good today.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.083
What can I say?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.917
A delightful little
addiction
I picked up in
narcotics.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.375
Where you got shot.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.667
Guess word really
does get around.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.125
Heard in fish town.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.792
Me and my partner
were undercover.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.667
Guy stops in to make a buy.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.542
Makes us for cops.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.291
Instead of walking away..

12:35.375 --> 12:37.333
He started blasting.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.208
Got me in the leg.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.000
My partner took him out.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.709
Partner made a good shooting.

12:44.458 --> 12:45.834
But I hesitated.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.667
It wasn't long after
that shooting in New
York.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.542
Black guy reached into his coat.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.333
Pulled out a wallet
instead of a gun.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.709
So you had that on your mind.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.542
You didn't want to
make the same mistake.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.000
And now I got
a pack-a-day habit.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.583
Trying to get
my head around that.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.750
(Terri)
'I still don't believe
it.'

13:09.834 --> 13:11.709
'Uh, Ro was
the perfect citizen.'

13:11.792 --> 13:13.917
Not a crook.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.500
Terri, your mom said
you and Ro were close.

13:16.583 --> 13:18.291
- Kept secrets.
- 'Yeah.'

13:18.375 --> 13:19.625
Not about bank robberies.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.291
But she did tell
you about Julius.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.083
That's what blows me away.

13:24.166 --> 13:25.458
(Jeffries)
'What do you mean?'

13:25.542 --> 13:27.792
Because I met the guy.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
You met Julius?

13:29.625 --> 13:31.625
- When?
- A few weeks before Ro died.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.875
She'd gone to lunch
and ran into him.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.709
He asked her for
drinks that night.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.083
And you went along?

13:37.166 --> 13:39.417
Ro was nervous.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.709
Besides, she really
wanted me to meet him.

13:41.792 --> 13:44.333
Said he was kind of
rock 'n' roll looking.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.375
But regular, nice.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.875
- And was he?
- Yeah.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.959
A perfect gentleman.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.166
The Soft Shoe Cafe. Who knew?

13:59.250 --> 14:01.417
I've never been here at night.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.917
Uh, Julius, this is Terri.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.500
A heads up about my pal.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.792
Bet you anything he
hits on you the second

14:07.875 --> 14:09.250
he brings the drinks.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.250
I love him, but
he...ain't the best.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.542
And you are?

14:13.625 --> 14:15.834
I'm the one you
gotta watch out for.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.750
Just jokin' ya.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.583
You're classier than
some of the winners

14:20.667 --> 14:22.125
I've been out with lately.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.458
About ready to lock myself away
with one of your books, Ro.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.583
"Lonesome, But Never Lonely",
right?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.834
- What's that?
- She teases me.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.083
About curling up with a book

14:31.166 --> 14:32.375
instead of going
out
Saturday nights.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.750
Says, "Aren't you lonely?"

14:33.834 --> 14:36.500
And Ro goes
"Lonesome, but never lonely."

14:36.583 --> 14:38.375
'Well, I'm like that,
working on my car.'

14:38.458 --> 14:41.291
Can spend a whole
weekend by myself.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.458
'Course, that's
also given me time

14:42.542 --> 14:44.333
to dream up my high wire act.

14:45.709 --> 14:48.375
I'm not against
a little danger
myself.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.250
Cocktails!

14:50.333 --> 14:51.542
Alright!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.625
Who's parched?

14:53.709 --> 14:55.458
The sisters, huh?

14:55.542 --> 14:56.959
Outstanding.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.375
Better say which
is which, Julius.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.625
Otherwise, I'll make
a run on 'em both.

15:00.709 --> 15:04.333
[laughs]
Well, I'm Terri

15:04.417 --> 15:05.917
and I'm leaving.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.125
(Julius)
'The Hat'

15:07.208 --> 15:08.375
strikes again.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.625
Okay, so, what happened?

15:13.709 --> 15:15.291
He got his hooks in her.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.667
She helps him rob the bank,
and then he kills her.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.375
We're working on all that.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.917
And the guy I met
was a bank robber, too.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.875
Julius called him "The Hat."

15:24.959 --> 15:26.000
Sounds like he was.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.625
He wanted me to go
dancing with him.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.208
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

15:31.291 --> 15:34.583
Chased me outside, said he was
a...bouncer at The Layback
Club.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.458
Um, we'd get right in.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.667
Layback Club. That was
a hot spot for a while.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.125
Well, the place is still open.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.917
Maybe "The Hat"
is still bouncin'.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.875
I don't know anything
about a nickname

15:44.959 --> 15:48.834
but the man you're talking
about sounds like Rick Carver.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.417
Rick still the
muscle around here?

15:50.500 --> 15:54.208
On the door up until
yesterday, then he retired.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.083
- Retired?
- His word, not mine.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.166
Pretty young to retire, right?

15:58.250 --> 16:01.500
Still had his bon voyage party
here last night, buying drinks

16:01.583 --> 16:04.583
for the whole club.
Bar bill was sick.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.375
It was so sick, why did you have
confidence he could pay the tab?

16:07.458 --> 16:09.875
Exactly, at first, I was
leery,
but then he flashed me

16:09.959 --> 16:11.500
the wad of hundreds
in his pocket.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.709
He give you the 4-1-1
where the money came from?

16:13.792 --> 16:18.375
Said his granny died,
and he got a big inheritance.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.125
What? That's not what happened?

16:20.208 --> 16:22.083
- No.
- Stop it.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.458
What did he do,
stick up a gas station?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.792
- Bank.
- Come on.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.542
Come on!

16:29.625 --> 16:33.792
So that's why Julius
was so pissed last night.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.125
- Who's Julius?
- Rick's brother.

16:36.208 --> 16:39.250
Stopped in at the end of the
night and was chewing him out.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.417
I was so drunk, couldn't
get all the super loungers

16:42.500 --> 16:44.875
to find out what was going on.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.792
Probably for burning through
that roll of hundreds.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.125
Don't you think?

16:49.208 --> 16:50.834
Making sense.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.458
I am going to need to
take the money, Ivan.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.917
Run those serial numbers
against the bank.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.875
How many you need, one?

16:57.959 --> 16:59.583
All of 'em.

16:59.667 --> 17:00.834
Crap.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.125
Hey! Up, up, up.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.583
- On your feet.
- Whoa, whoa!

17:08.667 --> 17:10.417
Man, this is unconstitutional.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.834
Rick Carver?

17:11.917 --> 17:13.750
- What is this?
- Detective Rush and Valens.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.959
- You did a robbery, Rick.
- No, I didn't.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.834
And your brother Julius, too.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.917
[sighing]
It's just a case
of mistaken identity.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.792
Yeah? We'll see about that.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.125
Hey, man, don't be
grabbin' that, yo.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.709
I just got that phone. Ow!

17:24.792 --> 17:26.542
Going to take your prints and
run 'em against that first

17:26.625 --> 17:27.834
bank job you pulled.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.959
- You're going down.
- It's a shame, too.

17:30.041 --> 17:33.041
Looks like you were
kicking butt in "Text
Twister."

17:33.125 --> 17:35.125
- I want a lawyer.
- 'It won't do you much
good.'

17:35.208 --> 17:37.667
Not after buying drinks last
night with that bank loot,
Rick.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.125
(Valens)
'We don't care
about the robberies.'

17:39.208 --> 17:40.792
FBI will bust you for that.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.959
We're here 'cause you
murdered
the teller, Roween Ryan.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.959
- I didn't shoot that girl.
- Then who did, your brother?

17:50.041 --> 17:51.792
After he tricked
her
into helping you?

17:51.875 --> 17:53.583
Boy, he sounds lower
than you, Rick.

17:53.667 --> 17:57.834
Hey, Julius never
tricked anybody.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.834
He was square with her, okay?

18:00.917 --> 18:03.458
And way before
we ever hit that bank.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.333
We've been having fun
together, right?

18:26.417 --> 18:27.959
Yeah, these two
weeks have been a
ball.

18:28.041 --> 18:31.583
So, you want to go
to Tahiti with me?

18:31.667 --> 18:33.291
Don't.

18:34.750 --> 18:37.291
Julius, are you serious?

18:37.375 --> 18:39.041
But I haven't even
stayed over yet.

18:39.125 --> 18:41.291
And I'd like for us
to wait on that till we

18:41.375 --> 18:45.083
get there, after a walk
on the beach at sunset.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.458
[laughs]
You
sure..

18:48.542 --> 18:51.000
You sure know how to
sweep a girl off her
feet.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.542
I need to tell you the rest.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.792
What? The suspense
is killing me.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.375
I want to rob
your bank on Friday

18:58.458 --> 19:01.208
and I want you to help me do it.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.041
Is this one of your jokes?

19:08.250 --> 19:10.375
- I don't get it.
- And the boys..

19:10.458 --> 19:11.917
'They're in it with me.'

19:13.709 --> 19:15.417
You're not fooling around,
are you?

19:15.500 --> 19:18.542
You know that high wire act
I've been talking about?

19:18.625 --> 19:21.166
- This is it.
- Julius, you can't rob a
bank.

19:21.250 --> 19:24.375
Ah, nobody'll get hurt,
and you know yourself

19:24.458 --> 19:27.291
all that money's insured.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.250
Ro, hear me out, please?

19:34.208 --> 19:36.250
I used to..

19:36.333 --> 19:38.959
...visit this
elderly lady..

19:39.041 --> 19:40.500
...Mary.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.917
On her last legs,
she liked to say.

19:44.125 --> 19:48.250
One day...I asked
if she had any regrets.

19:48.333 --> 19:52.041
'She, said, "Yes, a big one."'

19:52.125 --> 19:54.417
Said she played it too safe.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.417
Said, "as long as you
don't hurt no one"

19:57.500 --> 20:01.333
" go, have the time of your
life, 'cause before you know
it"

20:01.417 --> 20:02.917
"you're 87."

20:04.166 --> 20:07.208
Ha! Undefeated and
still champion.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.500
Ooh!

20:14.917 --> 20:17.500
That other friend of yours..

20:17.583 --> 20:20.500
...the way he stares,
it's like he has it out for
me.

20:20.583 --> 20:23.583
Oh, Phil, don't worry about him.

20:23.667 --> 20:26.083
We're not getting
any younger, Ro.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.375
So, how would it work?

20:43.542 --> 20:44.834
Who's Phil?

20:46.166 --> 20:48.792
Phil Jorgensen.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.041
I wasn't real big on him.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.333
He was...an old-time
pal of Julius'.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.750
Saying Phil shot Roween?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.583
My brother fell on his face
for that girl, okay?

20:59.083 --> 21:01.667
He wasn't gonna hurt her.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.834
And that's my bro's lady,
bro.
So you do the math.

21:04.917 --> 21:07.250
Where are they?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.208
- I don't know.
- 'Damn, bro.'

21:09.291 --> 21:11.625
You were doing so good, too.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.000
Guess it doesn't matter much.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.250
Jackie, Jake..

21:17.083 --> 21:18.542
Julius.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.667
FBI called, said we get
Rick's
phone back in the morning.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.333
So tomorrow, we use
it
to call Julius first
thing.

21:31.417 --> 21:34.375
That's the feds. Just gives
Julius more of a head start

21:34.458 --> 21:35.959
while we sit around 12 hours.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.625
Hey, let 'em have it, Scotty.

21:37.709 --> 21:40.291
It is a bank robbery,
it's their baby.

21:40.375 --> 21:43.166
- Yep.
- Goodnight.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.792
Goodnight, boss.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.041
Oh, see you tomorrow then?

21:47.125 --> 21:49.709
Sure thing.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.417
Yo. Heads up.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.125
Crap.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.333
You want me to take care of it?

22:07.333 --> 22:09.333
I'm good.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.875
I got to deal with
him sooner or later.

22:25.208 --> 22:27.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.125
(Miller)
'Boss?'

22:59.542 --> 23:00.667
Rick's prints match up?

23:00.750 --> 23:02.333
Good for both bank jobs.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.792
What do you got on the brother?

23:03.875 --> 23:06.208
A Julius Carver,
the younger of the two.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.250
Did a stint for burglary.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.875
Okay. Let's make the call.

23:10.959 --> 23:12.166
We're on it.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.458
Where the hell have you been?

23:26.542 --> 23:28.583
- 'Julius.'
- Who's this?

23:28.667 --> 23:31.291
John Stillman, Lieutenant,
Philly homicide unit.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.458
'We've got Rick.'

23:34.458 --> 23:36.500
You still there?

23:36.583 --> 23:37.625
Uh-huh.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.834
We need to talk, Julius.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.166
About?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.208
About the murder of Roween Ryan.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.667
Rick says he didn't shoot her.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.500
- He didn't.
- 'So?'

23:46.583 --> 23:48.333
Come in and tell us that.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.458
You're asking me
to turn myself in.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.125
You want to see Rick
get lethal injection,
Julius?

23:53.834 --> 23:54.834
Keep dreaming.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.625
- I'm not doing it.
- Unless..

23:57.709 --> 24:01.417
It was you who shot Roween.
Is that what happened, Julius?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.166
Buddy, if we were
face-to-face,
I'd take a swing at you.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.458
Say again?

24:05.542 --> 24:07.750
You don't talk
to me about Roween.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.959
And don't tell me
about sleepless nights.

24:11.041 --> 24:13.375
You saying you were
in love with Roween, Julius?

24:13.458 --> 24:14.917
'So much, that I..'

24:15.000 --> 24:20.375
...decided I could run from
my old life and start new.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.625
Wanna come inside?
You look cold.

24:29.709 --> 24:32.125
Oh, no, it's just these boots.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.792
I'm trying to break them in.

24:33.875 --> 24:36.875
Those the ones your
sister gave you?

24:36.959 --> 24:39.083
Yeah, they just
don't feel right.

24:39.166 --> 24:40.917
So maybe you should
take them off.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.417
No, I want to get
them ready, so..

24:43.500 --> 24:45.166
...I can wear them on Friday.

24:53.291 --> 24:56.458
Look, I'm starting to
worry that I won't show
up.

24:57.959 --> 25:01.667
Ro, I've been
thinking about Friday.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.375
- Oh?
- Let's call it off.

25:05.458 --> 25:06.417
What?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.750
It doesn't feel right.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.083
Julius, are you serious?

25:10.166 --> 25:11.291
Um-hmm.

25:12.709 --> 25:14.917
Well, what about Tahiti?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.250
I know how you wanna go.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.000
No, I got something way better.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.083
We'll have our own
little personal adventure

25:20.166 --> 25:21.834
right here in Philly.

25:24.667 --> 25:27.750
Oh, I'm so relieved.

25:29.917 --> 25:32.500
This has just all been
so perfect from the
moment

25:32.583 --> 25:35.834
you walked in the
bank.
It's like..

25:35.917 --> 25:39.083
Being down at the shore
and
getting swept up by the
tide.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.166
It's the same for me.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.000
But now we can

25:43.083 --> 25:44.959
catch a breath.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.959
- But what about the others?
- No, don't worry about them.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.959
I'll tell them
we're not doing it.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.125
But I do have one request.

25:58.625 --> 25:59.875
[laughing
]
What?

26:01.041 --> 26:03.125
I don't wanna wait anymore.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.792
I tried to call it off,
but Phil nixed it.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.917
So this Phil's a scary guy, huh?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.667
He's not someone you say no to.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.417
Maybe it's time
to break free of him.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.625
Yeah. Maybe so.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.333
I'll tell you where he is.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.333
Hums like you would not believe.

26:44.417 --> 26:45.542
Really?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.083
You ought to take
her out sometime.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.125
Not sure that's
the wisest thing.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.083
What's not the wisest?

26:51.166 --> 26:52.750
Hi, Lil.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.959
I was just telling Scotty
here he needs a bike.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.667
Let's talk. In private.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.500
What were you saying out there?

27:16.125 --> 27:18.625
Nothing.

27:18.709 --> 27:20.917
- Tell him about last night?
- No.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.208
Did he ask?

27:22.291 --> 27:25.041
Yeah, he did.

27:27.834 --> 27:29.000
Come here.

27:30.709 --> 27:32.208
No.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.542
Give me a kiss.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.792
- Forget it.
- Hey.

27:38.875 --> 27:42.041
[sighs]
You know, I'm the one
who should be mad.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.542
- You?
- Yeah.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.750
Took a page from my playbook.
I woke up this morning.

27:45.834 --> 27:47.250
- You were gone.
- 'Well, you know.'

27:47.333 --> 27:48.625
I have a job.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.542
Thought you'd be
on the road by
now.

27:53.625 --> 27:57.125
- Nope.
- You don't have to...clock
in?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.375
Not today.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.667
Still fixing those custom bikes?

28:01.750 --> 28:02.750
Better.

28:02.834 --> 28:03.959
Now I'm the boss.

28:05.959 --> 28:07.875
That's why I wanted to see you.

28:08.709 --> 28:09.875
Oh?

28:11.834 --> 28:13.458
So what do you think about that?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.583
Uh...boss is looking for you.

28:26.667 --> 28:28.917
- I need another minute.
- What should I tell him?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.667
That I need a minute.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.458
Gotta go, huh?

28:41.542 --> 28:42.834
In a sec.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.375
Why don't you just ditch work?

28:52.458 --> 28:54.125
Let's just go for a ride.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.375
So, that's it, huh?

29:04.458 --> 29:05.875
Sorry, I can't.

29:05.959 --> 29:07.417
Boss is calling.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.667
You did everything you said
you were gonna do, Lil.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.709
Made murder cop.

29:17.792 --> 29:19.875
I'm proud of you.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.792
But I guess
things change, right?

29:27.917 --> 29:30.041
I'm in town for one more night.

29:34.417 --> 29:35.709
Bye, Ray.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.333
- Philly PD.
- Show me your hands!

29:57.792 --> 29:59.125
What?

29:59.208 --> 30:01.709
- Phil Jorgensen?
- Yeah.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.709
You're under arrest for
the murder of Roween Ryan.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.333
And a couple of
bank
robberies, Phil.

30:05.417 --> 30:08.041
- I-I didn't kill Roween.
- Yes, you did, you hated
her.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.500
- Why would I hate her?
- Because she was Yoko Ono.

30:10.583 --> 30:11.875
Trying to break up the band.

30:11.959 --> 30:14.208
She was throwing Julius
off his game.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.542
Okay. That-that part is true.
I did think that.

30:17.625 --> 30:21.250
So when Julius came begging
off the job, you shut him
down.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.208
What? No.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.166
Julius didn't want
to stop the robbery.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.709
- He was telling stories.
- Stories to whom?

30:27.792 --> 30:30.375
Roween. He knew she was
going to go south on him.

30:30.458 --> 30:34.208
- So he beat her to the punch.
- So it was all just a con?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.875
Sure, that's what he does.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.875
The thing was going
forward as planned.

30:37.959 --> 30:39.917
We already got everything
from her we needed.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.208
Still, you're not concerned?

30:42.291 --> 30:44.750
Now Ro's not expecting it.
She could be a problem.

30:44.834 --> 30:47.375
Julius said she'd be
too scared to be a problem

30:47.458 --> 30:50.917
and if so, shoot her.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.709
- Cut and dried.
- That's why I had to warn
her.

30:54.667 --> 30:56.417
(Phil)
'He's lying to you, Ro.'

30:56.500 --> 30:58.333
'About the robbery,
about the two of you.'

30:58.417 --> 31:00.500
You weren't saying this the
other night at the apartment.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.917
Just glaring at me.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.750
You haven't even
said, "boo" till
now.

31:03.834 --> 31:06.667
There's lots of reasons
why people don't talk.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.125
Don't mean they don't want to.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.291
It- it's a setup, Ro.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.291
Besides, he's got someone else.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.208
Someone else?

31:19.291 --> 31:22.000
Be honest. You really
think you're his style?

31:22.083 --> 31:24.625
And I don't mean that in a bad
way, I mean it in a good way.

31:24.709 --> 31:26.125
Oh, you think it's just
impossible that I could turn

31:26.208 --> 31:27.250
someone's head, huh?

31:27.333 --> 31:29.500
No!

31:29.583 --> 31:32.000
No, you're something, Ro.

31:33.583 --> 31:35.917
Yeah, right.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.458
Maybe it's you that's
handing out the lines.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.208
That wasn't a line.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.291
Ro.

31:43.375 --> 31:46.458
Julius has a way
on people, alright?

31:46.542 --> 31:50.125
He spots your weakness,
mine was booze.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.458
You telling me he's got
you
under his thumb?

31:52.542 --> 31:54.959
I haven't made a decision
for myself till now.

31:56.792 --> 31:59.542
I'm not putting
moves on you, Ro.

31:59.625 --> 32:02.625
But after tomorrow,
I'm gonna be my own man.

32:02.709 --> 32:04.291
I know I'm good for someone.

32:07.208 --> 32:09.834
Tomorrow.

32:09.917 --> 32:11.041
The bank.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.000
'There's nothing we
can do about that.'

32:13.083 --> 32:15.333
'You have to go along
or he's gonna hurt you.'

32:15.417 --> 32:17.041
I swear.

32:19.875 --> 32:22.083
Who is she?

32:22.166 --> 32:25.333
- Who?
- You said he has someone else.

32:25.417 --> 32:26.875
You don't need to know that.

32:26.959 --> 32:29.041
Phil, if you're really
being
sincere, you'll tell me.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.667
And did you tell her?

32:35.750 --> 32:38.250
Yeah.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.834
Spill.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.041
Darla Dunaway.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.125
Bank teller who
worked alongside Ro.

32:44.208 --> 32:46.458
And current branch manager.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.500
So "worked-her-way-up" Darla

32:48.583 --> 32:49.959
was Julius's real squeeze, huh?

32:50.041 --> 32:53.083
And our other inside
connection on the bank job.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.458
Darla, you were the one

33:02.542 --> 33:04.917
making it with
Julius, not Roween.

33:06.125 --> 33:09.041
And it was my idea
to get Ro involved.

33:09.125 --> 33:10.542
Because she was the head teller.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.792
So the tale you told
about Julius stopping in

33:12.875 --> 33:16.583
for a cashier's check was
really you two reeling Ro in.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.875
That day was like a game.
Great fun.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.166
(Rush)
'So they rob the bank.'

33:24.250 --> 33:27.083
Shoot Ro and split.
But you stay.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.375
'So you can do it all
over again three days ago.'

33:29.458 --> 33:31.250
No. I wasn't a part
of it this time.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.125
And why should we believe that?

33:33.208 --> 33:35.417
Because Julius dumped me, too.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.083
- When?
- 'After the first heist.'

33:38.166 --> 33:40.583
I told him I wasn't some Roween.

33:40.667 --> 33:42.917
He told me that's
exactly what I was.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.125
And Julius knows you
won't rat him out now

33:45.208 --> 33:46.583
'cause you're an accomplice.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.083
But, I couldn't swallow it

33:48.166 --> 33:51.709
any longer, not after
what he did to us.

33:51.792 --> 33:53.041
Us?

33:53.125 --> 33:54.875
This was for Roween, too?

33:54.959 --> 33:57.125
Under the impression
you hated Ro.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.542
Probably what she thought
too, that last morning

34:01.625 --> 34:03.041
before she died.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.792
What's your problem?

34:12.875 --> 34:15.041
- I know.
- Know what?

34:15.125 --> 34:16.709
About you.

34:16.792 --> 34:18.959
How you're part of the robbery.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.709
How you're with Julius.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.125
[clicks tongue]
Ro, think of it this way.

34:24.208 --> 34:27.959
It's me and Julius's car. You
and Phil are in the backseat.

34:28.041 --> 34:31.250
Be grateful you're not
getting kicked to the curb.

34:33.542 --> 34:35.959
[clicks tongue]
I guess it is true
then.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.458
Don't let that mirror fool you.

34:41.542 --> 34:42.667
Excuse me?

34:43.792 --> 34:46.417
Julius sees us the same way.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.250
'He's playing you, too.'

34:48.333 --> 34:50.875
If you could just see that,
together we could stop this.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.000
Stop the robbery?

34:56.083 --> 34:58.417
On your own there, Ro.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.000
Don't sell me short.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.417
What are you going to
do,
call the cops?

35:02.500 --> 35:05.125
It's risky, but
there's still
time.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.458
Do it.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.208
[scoffs]
I knew
it.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.333
Face it, Ro, you're a toad.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.542
I'm not. It's not my fault.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.834
You try so hard to be
a bitch, and one day

35:17.917 --> 35:21.291
you'll see you don't need to.

35:21.375 --> 35:23.667
Even now, you still believe

35:23.750 --> 35:27.375
the knight on the white horse
is coming to take you away.

35:30.125 --> 35:33.041
8:20. Better get your
little heinie out there.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.250
It's almost time.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.208
Turns out, Ro was right.

35:37.291 --> 35:39.166
Julius screwed me.

35:39.250 --> 35:41.917
We've got Rick and
Phil in custody.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.375
- Now we need Julius.
- Been tracking him.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.750
We think he's in
Upper Darby somewhere.

35:46.834 --> 35:50.375
- 'Any ideas?'
- Luke's Lodge.

35:50.458 --> 35:51.792
His favorite B&B.

35:51.875 --> 35:55.125
And where he turned
me into a bank robber.

35:57.917 --> 35:59.375
Good.

35:59.458 --> 36:03.208
Now tell us Julius shot Ro,
and he'll take the worst of
it.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.542
All I know is
Julius
went to the vault

36:06.625 --> 36:08.709
and Rick was covering the door.

36:10.125 --> 36:12.959
Leaving Phil...at
the teller window.

36:14.542 --> 36:15.834
Where Ro was shot.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.792
Well, things just went from
bad to worse for you, Phil.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.375
What do you mean?

36:24.458 --> 36:26.917
You're all going down for
the robbery but you're taking

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
the heat for Ro's murder.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.750
I told you, Julius was the one.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.583
But the brothers joined
forces against you

36:32.667 --> 36:34.417
and Darla supports their theory.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.000
So three against one, you know.

36:37.083 --> 36:39.583
It's funny.

36:39.667 --> 36:42.917
I had no reason to go this time.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.625
Before, I was desperate.

36:44.709 --> 36:47.125
My boozing put me in the red.

36:47.208 --> 36:50.333
This time around,
my house was in order.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.959
Still, Julius
talked you into it.

36:52.041 --> 36:55.667
He found out Darla's
branch manager now.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.917
Job would be a piece of cake,
we'd score big this time.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.834
Hyped it pretty good, huh?

37:00.917 --> 37:04.000
He could've been the
world's
greatest car salesman.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.834
But it didn't matter.

37:05.917 --> 37:07.208
I just thought

37:07.291 --> 37:08.750
why not?

37:08.834 --> 37:11.333
I'm empty, anyway.

37:11.417 --> 37:13.208
Empty? Why?

37:14.375 --> 37:16.959
'Cause the one you loved
didn't love you back?

37:17.834 --> 37:20.000
No.

37:20.083 --> 37:22.667
In the end, I think
she would have.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.333
Thing is..

37:27.417 --> 37:29.875
...when someone opens a door..

37:29.959 --> 37:32.917
...you gotta be
ready to go through.

37:33.041 --> 37:36.500
So Ro was holding
the door for you?

37:36.583 --> 37:38.291
She offered me a way out.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.250
Should've taken it.

37:45.417 --> 37:48.667
But...should've,
would've, could've, right?

37:52.625 --> 37:54.750
Go! Open that door!
Open that door!

37:54.834 --> 37:56.834
Go, go, go, go!

37:56.917 --> 37:57.917
Get down!

37:59.750 --> 38:01.291
Everybody, down! On the floor!

38:01.375 --> 38:03.959
Everybody down! Stay down!

38:07.500 --> 38:09.625
Get down! Stay down!

38:09.709 --> 38:12.041
You! Come on! Come on! Come on!

38:12.125 --> 38:13.667
Open it!

38:13.750 --> 38:16.667
Let me see your hands!
Back away from the alarms!

38:16.750 --> 38:18.667
Do it! Do it now!

38:18.750 --> 38:20.250
Come on, come on, come on!

38:23.125 --> 38:24.792
You, get down on the ground!

38:27.667 --> 38:29.166
Let's go.

38:31.291 --> 38:35.291
- Give me her!
- You, go!

38:35.375 --> 38:36.875
Go on, do your part.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.959
Come on!

38:48.000 --> 38:50.208
[sighs]
Come on, baby.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.709
Baby, I couldn't tell you
we were going forward.

38:52.792 --> 38:54.583
You okay?

38:54.667 --> 38:57.500
Even calling me "baby" now, huh?

38:57.583 --> 38:58.750
What?

38:58.834 --> 39:01.083
You're a liar, Julius.

39:01.166 --> 39:02.500
'I know about Darla.'

39:02.583 --> 39:04.000
I know about everything.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.333
No kidding.

39:10.417 --> 39:12.959
So if you knew, why not
tip off the police?

39:14.500 --> 39:16.875
I guess one percent
of me was still
hoping

39:16.959 --> 39:19.875
that night on the
fire escape was for
real.

39:20.834 --> 39:23.417
Just joking you.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.917
The Hat is losing it
on the guard.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.917
Let's go. Hurry up.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.792
- Alright, open it.
- I'm gonna push the alarm.

39:43.875 --> 39:45.125
What are you talking about?

39:45.208 --> 39:47.667
It's time for
us
to stand up,
Phil.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.750
Stay with me.

39:52.834 --> 39:55.041
- We'll do it together.
- He'll hurt you.

39:55.125 --> 39:57.000
It's worth the risk.

39:57.083 --> 40:00.083
You can be your own
man right now, Phil.

40:07.166 --> 40:08.625
Bitch!

40:08.709 --> 40:10.542
She pushed the alarm.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.583
- What?
- She screwed us.

40:12.667 --> 40:13.917
We gotta walk.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.542
What are you waiting on? Do her.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.500
- No!
- 'No?'

40:30.583 --> 40:34.000
What, are you trying
to be someone now?

40:34.083 --> 40:36.208
You're worthless, a zero.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.041
'A friggin' lap dog.'

40:40.250 --> 40:42.166
Now!

40:42.250 --> 40:43.291
Do it.

40:45.417 --> 40:46.792
'I said do it!'

40:49.250 --> 40:50.959
'Don't try to decide.'

40:51.041 --> 40:53.166
'You can't make decisions.'

40:53.250 --> 40:54.208
'Not on your own.'

40:54.291 --> 40:56.458
'Not without booze.'

41:01.125 --> 41:02.417
'Good boy.'

41:04.375 --> 41:05.709
'That's it.'

41:08.291 --> 41:09.417
'Steady.'
