00:10.677 --> 00:15.181
  I don't believe you. Every
  morning you turn this place
   into a cosmetic counter.

00:15.215 --> 00:18.785
 You know I can't
 put make-up at home.
 My mom would kill me.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.054
   Make-up is your
   biggest problem?

00:21.087 --> 00:24.724
Trust me.
It takes a lot of hard work
to be a natural beauty.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.827
  Boy, must be easy being you.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.131
  Okay Nikki,
  what's your problem?

00:31.164 --> 00:34.167
  Parent-teacher week.
  The parent part.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.436
  What are you worried about?
  You're doing great.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.171
   Not great enough.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.240
  You know what my parents are
  gonna say when they find out

00:40.273 --> 00:42.409
  I'm only living
  up to my potential.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.478
 They'll say how
 proud they are of you.

00:45.512 --> 00:48.581
  That's what they'll say,
  but that's not
  what they'll mean.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.617
  You're nuts, you know that?

00:50.650 --> 00:53.153
 Maybe I should see a shrink.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.488
   And if that doesn't work,
   go shopping.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.458
( bell rings )

00:58.491 --> 01:01.661
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

01:01.695 --> 01:04.664
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

01:04.697 --> 01:07.767

02:03.823 --> 02:08.395
  Carrie: <i>Parent-teacher week</i>
  <i>reminds me of an anxiety</i>
  <i>filled show-and-tell.</i>

02:08.428 --> 02:11.865
 <i>Parents hoping</i>
 <i>to hear the best,</i>
 <i>students expecting the worst.</i>

02:11.898 --> 02:15.235
   <i>And the teacher</i>
   <i>having to place the truth</i>
   <i>somewhere in between.</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:17.270
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>how do you tell parents</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:20.206
   <i>their child is</i>
   <i>best qualified to</i>
   <i>be a speed bump?</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:24.477
Zack, Zack. Guess what?

02:24.511 --> 02:27.514
  Tickets to
  the Hot Lead concert
  go on sale Thursday morning.

02:27.547 --> 02:31.184
 Well, we're not gonna get any.
 Because Thursday
 is a school day.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.386
  Well,
  that shouldn't be a problem.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.522
   You said that ever since
   your parents got divorced,

02:35.555 --> 02:37.323
   your dad would do
   anything for you.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.692
   Well, can you believe it?

02:38.725 --> 02:40.527
   He won't write me
   any more doctor's excuses

02:40.560 --> 02:42.395
   unless I actually
   go to the doctor.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.832
 That's sick.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.603
Hi! Bye!

02:50.637 --> 02:53.540
 So, tell me about
 your rafting trip,
 did you meet anybody?

02:53.573 --> 02:57.677
   Well, actually,
   I met this wonderful man
   while clinging to a rock.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.746
 How exciting. What's his name?

02:59.779 --> 03:00.914
 -Peter.
 -Peter what?

03:00.947 --> 03:02.682
-I don't know.
-Well, what does he do?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.517
 -I don't know.
 -Where does he live?

03:04.551 --> 03:05.685
 I don't know.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.221
 Well, I certainly see
 why you like the guy.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.190
   No, it was
   the rules of the weekend.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.359
 No last names.
 No past. No present.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.727
Sounds like no future.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.663
 We did exchange phone numbers.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.931
   Why, he could be anybody.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.966
  A captain of industry.
  A famous surgeon...

03:20.066 --> 03:21.801
  Or Freddy Krueger.

03:21.835 --> 03:26.639
  Exactly.
  That's why I told him my name
  was Tina Paladrino.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.909
  I am not going out
  with any man whose
  nails are longer than mine.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.781
  Good morning, Mr. Belding.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.549
 My, aren't you
 cheery this morning.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.818
I am.
And you should be too.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.987
 It's the start of
 parent-teacher week.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.623
 Wonderful.
 My favorite time of the year.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.425
 Oh, it's always a lot of fun.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.994
  Maybe for you.
  Everyone loves you.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.865
 Mr. Belding,
 you're the principal.
 The man everyone looks up to.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.467
   Don't sweet talk me.
   I'm a hated man.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.270
   That's silly.
   They respect you.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.605
No they don't.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.507
 I am the man they were sent to

04:00.540 --> 04:03.043
 when they were children and
 they have never forgotten it.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.711
  Nobody wants to talk to me.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.252
  Hey, Zack, something's
  wrong with Screech.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.821
 Mikey, you've known
 him for eight years and
 you've just figured that out?

04:14.854 --> 04:17.390
 No, something's really wrong.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.458
 Look at him.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.062
  Okay I'll go cheer him up.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.898
 Hey, Screech, have you heard?

04:24.931 --> 04:29.502
 At exactly two o'clock today,
 a shower of asteroids is
 gonna level Cleveland.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.937
   Fine, I'll wear a helmet.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.475
You're right, Mikey.
He is strange.

04:35.508 --> 04:36.910
   Even for Screech.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.381
 Something wrong Lisa?

04:41.414 --> 04:44.517
 No, something's not wrong.
 Everything's wrong.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.353
   I wear make-up at school.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.822
   I know you do.
   You look lovely.

04:48.855 --> 04:53.426
 But you don't understand.
 My parents will kill me if
 they find out I wear make-up.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.928
 What make-up?

04:55.662 --> 04:57.097
Bless you, Miss Bliss.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.335
   Okay everyone.
   Settle down, settle down.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.704
 Now,

05:04.738 --> 05:08.842
 today is the start of
 a very special week.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.644
   And I'm really
   looking forward to
   meeting all your parents.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.714
  Uh, Miss Bliss,
  my mom can't come.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.884
  Okay class, I think
  we're in for a treat here.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.053
 And why is that Zack?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.321
 She went out of town.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.391
  -That's it?
  -That's it.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.359
 See, but my dad will be here.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.862
  He's got a very
  serious medical condition.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.431
 Doctors are fearful
 of any sudden shocks,

05:31.464 --> 05:33.633
   so just trash me
   at your own risk.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.337
 Now that's our Zack.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.446
  And we are now
  descending on the grand
  concourse of the facility.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.783
  This is the hub,
  the very heartbeat of JFK.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.985
 Those of us in
 the trade call it The Lobby.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.089
   To the right we
   have the lockers.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.825
   To the left, Mr. Belding.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.727
   Hello, I'm the principal.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.334
   I see you still
   haven't lost your touch.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.803
   Hey wait up. Mr. Wilson!

06:11.471 --> 06:13.740
   It was a pleasure
   meeting you Mrs. Reitman.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.710
 It's obvious who
 Cindy inherited
 her personality from.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.749
  Obviously from her father.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.953
Peter.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.056
Carrie.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.726
 What are you doing here?
 How did you find me?

06:32.759 --> 06:34.561
   Well, I didn't find you.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.731
  I mean, obviously I have,
  but I'm looking
  for a Miss Bliss.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.066
 Well, you found her.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.935
   I'm a teacher. Surprised?

06:41.968 --> 06:45.538
  Yes. Delightfully.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.074
  And I've got
  a surprise for you.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.610
 I'm Peter Morris. Zack's dad.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.746
 What?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.714
Oh, no.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.684
  No, tell me you're joking.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.853
All right, I'm joking.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.521
   I'm his brother.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.657
  Peter, be serious.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.060
 Don't make it any more
 difficult than it already is.

07:07.093 --> 07:12.032
 Hey, what happened to the girl
 who fell overboard with me?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.668
  She's treading water
  as fast as she can.

07:14.701 --> 07:18.571
 Listen, if you
 think Zack will mind us
 seeing each other, he won't.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.473
 He's seen me date other women.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.042
   Oh, and not a lot of 'em.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.777
  Actually, just one.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.113
  We are not even
  gonna discuss this.

07:27.147 --> 07:31.084
We are going to discuss
parent-teacher things.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.854
 All right, all right. You win.

07:34.888 --> 07:39.159
   Of all my students,
   Zack has the most potential.
   But...

07:39.192 --> 07:43.596
 I know, I know.
 He has no built-in boundaries,

07:43.630 --> 07:44.764
  discipline,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.067
or restraint.
Would you like to go
out to dinner with me?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.869
 Yes.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.073
   I mean no. We are
   here to discuss your son.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.477
You are just like Zack.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.612
  Well, I should be.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.748
   After all,
   I am his brother.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.620
And I'm his teacher
and I'm being serious.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.091
 And I can't go out with you.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.492
  I really am sorry.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.700
  Hi.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.036
 What's this?

08:23.069 --> 08:25.038
  Well, my parents
  are coming tonight.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.475
  And I know how
  boring it must be to talk
  about the same old things.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.810
   So you prepared
   a list of topics.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.611
   How considerate.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.881
The Cornelius Theory of
Nocturnal Polarization.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.051
 Yeah,
 they're real gravity freaks.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.890
  Ok, spill it. Now.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.494
 I told my parents I was
 president of the eighth grade.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.162
-Samuel.
-It gets worse,

08:49.195 --> 08:52.565
   I'm editor of newspaper,
   captain of the
   baseball team,

08:52.599 --> 08:54.534
   and lead baritone
   in the glee club.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.569
 Is that all?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.507
 Did I mention Homecoming king?

09:01.741 --> 09:04.010
 You lied to your parents. Why?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.079
You don't know what
it's like, Miss Bliss,

09:06.112 --> 09:08.782
   I can't let my parents
   think their son's a dud.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.817
  You are not a dud.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.620
   But what you've
   always been is truthful.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.023
  But I can't tell
  them the only position
  I've held is glue monitor.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.025
 Glue monitor?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.829
Believe me,
it's not as
glamorous as it sounds.

09:22.862 --> 09:26.099
 Your parents love you, Samuel,
 and you must
 tell them the truth.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.037
  Okay, Miss Bliss,
  but when they
  find out I'm tenor,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.138
   it'll break their hearts.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.115
   Peter.
   What are you doing here?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.217
 Came to pick up Zack.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.820
Well, you'll find him
on the athletic field.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.756
I know.
That's why I came here.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.559
Peter.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.694
  Didn't you hear
  anything I said last night?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.296
  Every word.

09:56.329 --> 10:00.567
 I told you nothing would have
 ever started if I had known
 you were Zack's father.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.135
 Well, it's too late.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.639
-It's already started.
-No, no. Peter.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.275
   ( door opening )

10:09.309 --> 10:10.944
  Hey, Dad...

10:10.977 --> 10:12.779
   Oh, jeez.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.922
 Zack.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.190
  Let me explain, you see...

10:24.224 --> 10:26.393
Uh, Zack, this is not
what it appears to be.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.962
 -You mean you weren't kissing.
 -No.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.998
 Uh, no, uh...
 We were, uh,

10:32.032 --> 10:34.000
   kissing.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.003
   Dad, I know you wanna make a
   good impression
   on my teachers,

10:37.037 --> 10:38.738
   you don't have to
   kiss all of 'em.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.041
   Not all of them,
   just Miss Bliss.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.744
 Oh, good thing.
 Coach Porius is really ugly.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.947
  Zack,
  this is not what you think.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.051
 We met last weekend
 on the rafting trip.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.987
  Great. Hey, Dad, are we still
  going out for burgers?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.856
 Zack, are you okay about this?

10:56.890 --> 11:00.326
Yeah, sure. Why won't I be?
Everything's fine.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.695
Adults get so uptight.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.664
 -Oh, I'm not uptight.
 Are you uptight?
 -No.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.799
 No, I'm not uptight.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.069
See? We're not uptight.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.672
  I was just going to ask
  Miss Bliss, if she wanted to
  come to dinner with us.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.707
   Oh, no thank you.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.375
  Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.943
 Zack?

11:16.976 --> 11:18.078
  Yeah, sure.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.851
 And then I walked in
 and saw them kissing.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.087
 It was like someone punched me
 in my stomach.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.122
I couldn't breathe.
It was like the worst.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.423
 Wow.

11:30.457 --> 11:34.194
   Your dad and Miss Bliss.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.130
  How would you feel
  if you saw your dad
  kiss your teacher?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.898
 I'd love it.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.334
  Hey,
  he'd have to pay me a fortune
  not to tell my mom.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.804
   You know,

11:44.838 --> 11:47.440
  if my dad's going
  to date my teacher,

11:47.474 --> 11:49.109
 it's gonna cost 'em.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.378
  What are you talking about?

11:51.411 --> 11:54.114
 We're going to
 the Hot Lead concert.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.983
  Well, uh, how are we
  going to cut school
  to get the tickets?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.918
  Hey, don't worry about it.

11:59.819 --> 12:00.820
   It's between me,

12:01.287 --> 12:02.889
  and Carrie.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.057
Carrie?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.127
Since when do you
call Miss Bliss Carrie?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.329
   Since I caught them
   making out in home room.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.073
  Oh, Samuel.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.275
  Now, I saw your
  parents last night.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.144
 I'm glad you
 told them the truth.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.079
  Can you believe it,
  Miss Bliss?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.847
  They just want me to be me.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.716
 I knew they'd react that way.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.286
 And get this.
 My dad told me he
 was glue monitor too.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.255
   That's how he got
   stuck on my mom.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.256
  ( giggles )

12:36.289 --> 12:39.092
 Well, I'm glad everything
 turned out all right.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.760
  Thanks, Miss Bliss.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.195
  You're a real pal.

12:42.228 --> 12:43.496
  If you ever want anything,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.465
   mice, hamsters, gerbils.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.100
   Anything at all.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.201
   Just ask.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.469
  Thank you, Samuel.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.005
   If I ever need a rodent,
   you're my man.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.511
 Okay everyone,
 pass your homework
 to the front, please.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.447
   Watch this move.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.350
  Miss Bliss, I'm sorry,
  but I didn't get
  a chance to do my homework.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.885
Who's this freak?
He's dead meat.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.954
 The truth is, I was up late.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.090
   Zack, that is no excuse.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.759
Well, I was talking
things out with my dad,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.327
   if you know what I mean.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.829
She'll never buy that.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.132
   Okay, I understand, Zack.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.400
 Hand it in tomorrow.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.336
  What have you
  done to Miss Bliss?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.140
 ( murmuring )

13:28.074 --> 13:29.476
How's it going,
Mr. Belding.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.077
Oh, hello, Miss Bliss.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.812
   I want you to know
   that I took your advice.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.080
   I extended myself

13:34.080 --> 13:37.384
 and I had a very pleasant talk
 with several of the parents.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.220
 Oh, good.
 I knew it would work.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.156
 Of course,
 he didn't exactly
 tell them who he was.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.092
   I was going to tell them,

13:46.092 --> 13:49.462
   but they started
   telling principal jokes.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.798
  So what did you do?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.000
What could I do?
I told a couple
of zingers too.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.502
 ( chuckling )

13:55.535 --> 13:57.971
 Actually, a couple of
 them weren't too bad.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.840
   Especially the one about
   the principal and Gumby.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.242
   -You see Gumby...
   -Mylo.

14:05.445 --> 14:09.783
  You're absolutely right.
  It is rather inappropriate.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.918
  Oh, come on.
  What was the joke?

14:11.951 --> 14:14.754
It's a side of Pokey
I'd rather not discuss.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.290
 Mr. Belding,

14:17.323 --> 14:18.525
  I need your advice.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.061
Oh, good. About school?

14:21.061 --> 14:23.430
  No. Well, sort of,

14:23.463 --> 14:24.864
but not really.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.534
Well, it's either about
school or it's personal.
It can't be about both.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.502
 Well, it is.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.439
  You see, last weekend I met
  this man and I thought
  he was someone else,

14:32.472 --> 14:36.276
 I mean, other than
 who I thought he was.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.944
  What was he, a spy?

14:38.545 --> 14:39.779
  No, he was,

14:40.146 --> 14:41.981
he is,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.884
  sort of related to
  one of my students.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.087
 Well, who is he?
 Zack Morris' father?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.154
  ( laughs )

14:50.557 --> 14:51.591
   Oh, boy.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.863
 If you'd rather
 not talk about this,
 I understand.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.199
   No, I don't mind
   talking about it.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.034
  I'm not dating
  a students' father.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.102
  Or mother?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.904
 I'm married.
 I am happily married.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.074
What am I going to do?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.776
Carrie,

15:09.809 --> 15:13.046
if it makes you feel any
better, I know what
you're going through.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.048
 -You do?
 -Yes.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.051
   See, you want me to tell you
   that everything
   will be all right.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.286
   I can't do that.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.856
I really feel for you.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.493
  Would you pass the ketchup?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.605
  Hey, Nikki, how did
  it go with your parents
  and Miss Bliss last night?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.740
You were right.
It was all in my head.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.876
I don't even know
why I was ever worried.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.978
   They said I'm doing great

15:45.078 --> 15:47.881
   and they're so happy,
   they're taking me to
   Chicago for the weekend.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.683
 Wow.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.951
  I'm doing great
  and my parents
  aren't taking me anywhere.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.288
 Come to think of it,

15:55.321 --> 15:57.524
they didn't say anything
about bringing me home.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.226
You know, you are nuts.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.529
  Skip the shopping.
  Go straight to the shrink.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.864
   ( bell ringing )

16:07.400 --> 16:09.402
  Anyone seen Zack or Mikey?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.905
 They were here for home room.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.308
 Don't look at me, Miss Bliss.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.578
 I know nothing about them
 cutting school to
 buy concert tickets.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.781
 Oops.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.452
 Concert tickets, huh?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.487
 Why do people tell me things?

16:28.755 --> 16:30.190
By any chance, Samuel,

16:30.223 --> 16:34.361
 did they happen to say when
 they might be gracing us with
 their presence?

16:34.394 --> 16:35.762
  For once I'm safe.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.330
 I really don't know.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.531
   Can't tell you anything.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.301
  But if they're on schedule,

16:41.334 --> 16:42.936
they're probably sneaking
through the school yard

16:43.770 --> 16:45.238
  right now.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.740
 ( students giggling )

16:47.340 --> 16:48.375
 Oops.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.811
   I think they
   deserve a proper welcome.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.681
Nikki, watch the class.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.720
  ( door squeaking )

17:01.454 --> 17:03.356
  Zack, we messed up.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.326
 We're really late
 for Bliss's class
 and we didn't get the tickets.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.694
 Well, don't blame me.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.463
  I didn't know Hot Lead
  was going to get the mumps.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.464
  Hey, would you just relax?

17:12.499 --> 17:13.733
 It's only Miss Bliss.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.602
  Miss Bliss?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.604
 Well,
 uh, what happened to Carrie?

17:17.637 --> 17:18.672
Carrie?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.474
   That's it. We're history.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.644
   Miss Bliss,
   we've been looking
   all over for you.

17:24.678 --> 17:25.712
   We looked in your class,

17:25.744 --> 17:26.746
  we looked in the cafeteria,

17:26.780 --> 17:28.314
and you weren't there.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.883
   Huh, you were in
   the halls the whole time.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.252
I know you were
buying concert tickets.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.319
 That's right.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.387
 And you weren't there either.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.822
You know,
Hot Lead got the mumps?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.858
 Zack, enough.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.061
   Call your father,
   I want to see
   him after school.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.529
 Can't you wait until tonight?

17:45.865 --> 17:48.535
  Mikey, go to class.
  You don't have to
  call your parents.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.602
   I don't?

17:50.337 --> 17:51.604
Thank you, Miss Bliss.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.307
   I'm so relieved.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.675
 So grateful.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.477
I'll see them tonight.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.545
   So dead.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.353
Zack, what's going on?

18:06.386 --> 18:09.389
Nothing.
I cut school, I got busted.
No big deal.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.825
   You're wrong.
   It is a big deal.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.831
  And, I think it's time,
  we talked about
  your father and me.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.766
Hey, there's
nothing to talk about.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.601
It's got
nothing to do with me.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.703
   It's between you and him.

18:23.737 --> 18:25.305
  It's got
  everything to do with you.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.840
How do you feel
about it, Zack?

18:26.873 --> 18:29.542
 -Hey, it's fine
 with me if you just...
 -Zack!

18:29.576 --> 18:30.944
-What?
-How did you...

18:31.044 --> 18:33.880
 How did you feel
 when you saw us kiss?

18:35.048 --> 18:36.683
  I hated it.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.051
   Look, I don't want you to be
   my fathers' girlfriend.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.386
 Is that what you want to hear?

18:39.919 --> 18:40.954
 Yes.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.490
 Yes, if that's the truth, yes.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.091
 Well, it is.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.961
I'm sorry, it probably
doesn't make any sense,

18:48.061 --> 18:49.829
 but it just doesn't feel good.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.368
   As a matter of fact,
   it makes very good sense.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.470
  And I'm...

18:57.504 --> 18:59.072
 I'm sorry I hurt you.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.077
 I tried to convince
 myself that it was all right

19:04.110 --> 19:08.081
to go out with your father,
but deep inside,
I knew it was wrong.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.550
  Miss Bliss,

19:10.583 --> 19:13.319
I don't want to
lose you as my teacher.

19:13.353 --> 19:17.424
And I don't want to
lose you as my student.
That's very important.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.025
 You're very
 special to me, Zack.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.429
 And I hope you can forgive me.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.831
 Yeah,

19:24.864 --> 19:26.366
  I can forgive you.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.370
  Miss Bliss,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.739
   I think this kind of means
   that we can forget about me
and Mikey cutting class.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.342
  No!

19:35.375 --> 19:38.044
  -But, Miss Bliss...
  -Zack, don't start.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.650
-Hi.
-Peter

19:44.818 --> 19:46.619
  I'm so glad you
  were able to come.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.054
Why, I feel privileged.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.590
   Two parent-teacher
   conferences in one week.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.059
 Well, this isn't about
 parents and teachers.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.561
  It's, um, about us.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.129
   Am I in trouble?

19:56.162 --> 19:57.530
Why don't you sit down.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.065
Uh, oh, I'm in trouble.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.937
Peter,

20:07.941 --> 20:12.045
 you're charming and
 intelligent and you have
 a great sense of humor.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.981
 In fact,
 everything a woman
 could possibly want.

20:15.015 --> 20:16.649
But...

20:16.683 --> 20:18.985
You are Zack's father.

20:19.019 --> 20:21.621
 And that makes you
 out of bounds for me.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.923
  Well, uh...

20:23.957 --> 20:27.660
   What if I sent Zack
   to school in Switzerland?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.129
 Peter...
 ( chuckles )

20:30.730 --> 20:35.068
What are my chances
of changing your mind?

20:35.101 --> 20:40.106
  About as good as Zack's
  chances are, of not getting
  punished for cutting school.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.812
  Oh.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.782
Boy, I'm glad I didn't
have you for a teacher.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.952
But I'm glad Zack does.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.988
   So am I.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.189
  He's very special.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.258
 Yes.
