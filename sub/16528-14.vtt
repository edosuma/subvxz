00:00.034 --> 00:02.768
ADULT ADAM:<i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> before you could</i>
<i> buy everything</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:04.169
<i> from your couch,</i>
<i> you had to drive</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:05.738
<i> to an actual location</i>
<i> to get stuff.</i>

00:05.740 --> 00:08.507
<i> This magical place</i>
<i> was known as "The mall."</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:11.143
<i> It was the center</i>
<i> of every teenager's universe.</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:14.747
<i> And nobody loved the mall more</i>
<i> than my brother and sister.</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:16.949
Mmm!
Hickory farms samples!

00:16.951 --> 00:17.950
What's better
than free meat?

00:17.952 --> 00:19.852
Do you even know
what you're eating right now?

00:19.854 --> 00:22.354
Hello?
It's summer sausage.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.790
It's delicious
because it's made by the sun.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.826
This just might be
the best day of my life.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.460
Oh, no!

00:28.462 --> 00:31.263
ADULT ADAM:<i> For my brother,</i>
<i> the mall took a dark turn</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:33.232
<i> when it was time</i>
<i> to make the lemonade.</i>

00:33.234 --> 00:35.634
Attention, perverts!

00:35.636 --> 00:38.670
Look away from
the hot dog on a stick girl

00:38.672 --> 00:40.372
or face my fury!

00:40.508 --> 00:41.340
Uh, Barry?
What's the deal?

00:41.342 --> 00:44.276
Well, honey,
similar to Bruce Lee in
<i> Enter the dragon,</i>

00:44.278 --> 00:46.545
I am about
to fight everyone!

00:46.547 --> 00:48.881
Erica, hold my meat.
Hold your own meat!

00:48.883 --> 00:51.817
Babe, these guys aren't here
just to watch me
make lemonade.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.019
They do it for everyone.
See? Look at Dave Kim.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.587
Boo!
(CROWD GROANS)

00:55.589 --> 00:57.156
That's right,
that's right.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.157
Walk away.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.324
Will you stop it?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.092
I want to keep this job.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.227
The money's good, and I got
my eye on one of those.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.663
The best yellow boom box
money can buy.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.664
Look at all that yellow!

01:05.666 --> 01:08.300
It's so compact
and waterproof.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.069
That's perfect
for my swim routine.

01:10.071 --> 01:10.736
Well, keep dreaming,

01:10.738 --> 01:12.738
'cause there's no way
Dad's ever gonna buy us one.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.706
Well, you could always
get jobs.

01:14.708 --> 01:14.973
A job?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.342
How would I be able to spend
time after school at the mall

01:17.344 --> 01:19.111
if I already have a job
after school at the mall?

01:19.113 --> 01:22.648
Eh, too bad, 'cause they're
hiring at Spencer's Gifts.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.083
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Ah, Spencer's Gifts,</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:24.983
<i> the mall's</i>
<i> one and only novelty store</i>

01:24.985 --> 01:29.621
<i> that specialized</i>
<i> in wacky gag gifts</i>
<i> guaranteed to offend.</i>

01:29.623 --> 01:30.389
BOTH: Whoa!

01:30.391 --> 01:32.758
I can actually get a job
at the store

01:32.760 --> 01:35.961
I bought two of my four
Spuds MacKenzie posters?

01:35.963 --> 01:37.496
This is a dream come true!

01:37.498 --> 01:39.832
'Cause I need money
and they're hiring!

01:40.601 --> 01:43.035
Dad, we need you to sign
a permission slip.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.803
Ask your mother.
She's not home.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.138
I hope it's not
time-sensitive.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.072
Good luck to both of you.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.474
We both got jobs
at Spencer's Gifts,

01:48.476 --> 01:50.309
and we can't start
until we get parental consent.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.777
Give it to me!
I'll sign it right now!

01:51.779 --> 01:53.645
Before you do,
you should really understand

01:53.647 --> 01:54.680
what you're agreeing to.
I agree.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.116
Just know if you
sign that slip,
there's a good chance

01:57.118 --> 01:59.518
we'll become fully independent
and move out.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.252
Damn it, where's my pen?

02:00.254 --> 02:01.653
You might not even
have to pay for college.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.522
I need my pen!
Here you go, Father.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.757
Let's sign this baby.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.660
And that's just
one of the many
hilarious items

02:08.662 --> 02:09.995
we'll be selling
at Spencer's Gifts.

02:09.997 --> 02:13.565
Not even you being a moron
can spoil my mood.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.401
This is the greatest day
of my life!

02:16.403 --> 02:17.936
Uh, this'll work.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.271
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:19.273 --> 02:23.142
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:25.446 --> 02:26.612
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:26.614 --> 02:30.382
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:30.584 --> 02:34.253
<i> ¶ I see your true colors</i>
<i> shining through ¶</i>

02:34.255 --> 02:36.722
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was February 15th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:36.724 --> 02:38.790
<i> and I was hard at work</i>
<i> honing my skills</i>

02:38.792 --> 02:40.926
<i> as a VHS home-movie maker.</i>

02:40.928 --> 02:42.995
<i> Not everyone was a fan,</i>
<i> but there was</i>

02:42.997 --> 02:46.498
<i> one blond-haired lady</i>
<i> who couldn't get enough.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.233
Yeah,
I stare at him, too.

02:48.235 --> 02:48.700
(CHUCKLES)

02:48.702 --> 02:50.836
It's hard to believe
that the bigger he gets,

02:50.838 --> 02:52.704
the more delicious
he becomes, huh?

02:52.706 --> 02:54.506
ERICA: Are we looking
at the same thing?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.008
The hell is in your
son's hands right now?

02:56.010 --> 02:59.678
Why does he have a waterproof
Sports Boombox with mega bass

02:59.680 --> 03:01.880
when we had to get jobs
to get one?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.682
Adam is not like
the two of you.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.951
He can't just work
any old job.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.754
He's, uh...
What do I want to say here...

03:08.756 --> 03:09.688
Better than you.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.190
He's better than you!
You can't say that!

03:11.192 --> 03:12.624
I knew you'd understand.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.994
Dad, tell your wife
to tell your boy son

03:15.996 --> 03:18.363
that he needs to get a job,
like the rest of us.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.464
Hey, moron!

03:19.466 --> 03:21.066
Get a job,
like the other two morons.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.203
No, thanks. See, I'm not
so much the job guy.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.171
I'm more the guy
behind the job guy

03:26.173 --> 03:28.040
who just sits there
and plays with his toys.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.108
You get it.
I don't. Get a job.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.412
No, n-n-n-n-n-n-no.
Adam doesn't need a job.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.214
He's already got a career.
Doing what?

03:35.216 --> 03:38.116
Adam is going to be
a famous director.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.918
Mmm.
And if you don't believe me,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.453
just ask his
guidance counselor.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.223
No, your son would do
miserably in Hollywood,

03:44.225 --> 03:44.957
and that's a fact.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.559
My son is a star,
and you're gonna die alone!

03:47.561 --> 03:48.927
While I do feel that way,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.662
I'm just stating
the hard truth.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.264
It's more likely
that your puny son

03:52.266 --> 03:54.299
will become a power forward
for the Sixers

03:54.301 --> 03:56.068
than a big
Hollywood muckety-muck.

03:56.070 --> 03:56.468
Oh, no, Mama.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.837
I don't want to play whatever
sport he's talking about.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.038
Don't worry, sweet potato.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.974
Mr. Glascott
doesn't know anything.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.141
Oh, but I do.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.310
You see, I once made
my way out to LA.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.445
With my own
foolish dreams.

04:06.447 --> 04:10.115
I thought I'd become
a big-time
Hollywood scriptwriter.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.217
I even wrote a teleplay.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.518
"Sole brothers"?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.887
MR. GLASCOTT:
That's "Sole" spelled S-O-L-E.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.757
Upon their father's death,
two brothers take the reins,

04:18.759 --> 04:21.827
or laces
of the family shoe store.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.163
They're detectives,
but they have
different styles.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.532
You really need to read it.
No, I don't.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.467
What are you telling
my boy?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.736
I'm telling your son the same
thing Robert Wagner told me

04:30.738 --> 04:33.205
when I approached him
in the men's room
at Chasen's,

04:33.207 --> 04:34.473
"This is inappropriate."

04:34.475 --> 04:35.574
Okay, let me clean this up.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.110
He's saying you're definitely
not gonna make it.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.278
Good talk.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.879
But Mom believes in me.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.147
Yeah, well,
she also believes

04:42.149 --> 04:44.850
that Erica's gonna be
on the cover of<i> Rolling Stone</i>

04:44.852 --> 04:46.351
and Barry's
gonna be a surgeon.

04:46.353 --> 04:49.688
Oh, sweet balls! None of those
things are ever gonna happen!

04:49.690 --> 04:50.322
I have to get a job.

04:50.324 --> 04:53.659
But you already have one,
making wonderful home movies

04:53.661 --> 04:56.061
and winning the
Academy Award of my heart.

04:56.063 --> 04:56.695
Mom, it's okay.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.032
Based on Mr. Glascott's
tale of broken dreams,

05:00.034 --> 05:01.199
I should explore
my options.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.435
Okay, fine.
You can try one job.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.471
But as soon
as everyone realizes
that this a detour

05:06.473 --> 05:08.440
from what is obviously
your destiny,

05:08.442 --> 05:11.109
you're going back to being
my little moviemaker.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.312
Boom! He's getting a job.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.613
There you go.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.714
Oh, speaking of
my screenplay,

05:15.716 --> 05:19.117
I mocked up a poster
to help sell it in the room.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.521
These are
twin shoe salesmen/detectives,

05:22.523 --> 05:24.256
Jeffrey Sole and
David Alan brothers.

05:24.258 --> 05:26.892
If they're brothers,
why do they have
different last names?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.627
If you read the script,
you'd understand!

05:28.629 --> 05:31.630
ADULT ADAM:<i> While I was</i>
<i> warming to the novelty</i>
<i> of having a job,</i>

05:31.632 --> 05:34.199
<i> Barry and Erica were</i>
<i> warming to their jobs</i>

05:34.201 --> 05:35.534
<i> of selling novelties.</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:36.635
And last but not least,

05:36.637 --> 05:41.640
we have our edible underpants
in all flavors and sizes.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.508
Questions?
I got one.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.609
This place is awesome.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.478
That's not a question,
kiss-ass.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.446
That's all right.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.781
I share young Barry's verve
for the gag game.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.918
Well, sir, I'm gonna learn
everything about this place,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.619
starting with
the exploding golf balls.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.988
Sorry.
Barry offers enthusiasm,
but not much else.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.824
Really?
'Cause on his application,

05:58.826 --> 05:59.991
he said he was a genius

05:59.993 --> 06:02.461
who was studying
pre-brain-surgery.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.931
Yep. (COUGHS)
They explode, all right.

06:05.933 --> 06:06.998
Okay, here's what
you need to know.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.435
Barry's gonna break stuff,
scare customers,
hurt himself.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.571
But he's my brother
and I love the dope,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.773
so I'm offering
to be a buffer.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.708
Thanks for the heads-up,
Erica.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.977
How could you!
What?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.546
I heard everything,
thanks to this!

06:21.548 --> 06:23.515
You sold me out
on the first day?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.984
I'm just protecting you
from the biggest danger

06:25.986 --> 06:27.018
in your life... you.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.721
You really think
you're better than me
at everything?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.155
That I'm a joke?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.691
Barry, you're covered
in exploding golf ball dust.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.625
Well, you're the joke.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.828
'Cause I'm not just gonna be
the greatest brain doctor,

06:36.830 --> 06:41.032
I'm also gonna be
the greatest Spencer's Gifts
employee.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.300
How, you ask?

06:42.302 --> 06:42.901
I'll Out-Spencer Gifts you.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.804
Now, I got to get myself
a new shirt,
'cause this one's ruined.

06:45.806 --> 06:50.275
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so began the great</i>
<i> Goldberg Spencer Gift-off.</i>

06:50.277 --> 06:52.844
Sold my first item.
Suck it.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.947
<i> Yep, my brother was convinced</i>
<i> he would walk away the winner.</i>

06:55.949 --> 06:57.682
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> I needed a job myself,</i>

06:57.684 --> 07:00.519
<i> and it was gonna take</i>
<i> a true miracle.</i>

07:00.521 --> 07:01.887
<i> Wait a minute.</i>

07:01.889 --> 07:02.721
Help found!

07:02.723 --> 07:05.323
<i> If I could pass</i>
<i> the impossible interview.</i>

07:05.325 --> 07:07.192
How many quarters
are in a dollar?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.093
Four.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.694
I'll be in the back,
taking a nap.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.497
Sweet.
Oh. And we're running
a promotion.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.966
Every "A" a kid has
on his report card,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.101
he gets a quarter.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.602
Got it?
Sir, yes, sir!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.104
Don't do that.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.840
Dad,
today I became a man!

07:21.842 --> 07:23.875
Go brag to your friends
and your Grandpa.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.143
That's not a "me" thing.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.912
No, no! I got a job!

07:26.914 --> 07:27.712
A real one?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.681
Yep, at my favorite place
in the world,

07:29.683 --> 07:30.916
the arcade.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.185
All my children
have jobs?

07:33.187 --> 07:34.085
This is my dream.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.487
I close my eyes,
and this is what I see.

07:35.489 --> 07:39.057
That's a sad dream,
but you have a sad life,
so I get it.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.225
Come here!

07:40.227 --> 07:42.027
What's happening?
This is me hugging you.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.396
No!
I'm hugging you!
Just accept it!

07:44.398 --> 07:46.131
Mom! Dad's trying to hug me!

07:46.133 --> 07:48.600
Oh, Murray,
you're finally expressing

07:48.602 --> 07:50.769
your love and affection
towards your children!

07:50.771 --> 07:52.938
No, the little weird one
got a job!

07:52.940 --> 07:54.739
What? Who would hire him?

07:54.741 --> 07:55.974
Don't know. Don't care.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.009
I thought he'd be
singing in a wig for years.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.212
Me, too.
Now, if you don't mind,

08:00.214 --> 08:01.713
I'm gonna go adjust
my change belt.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.281
It was hanging
a little low.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.115
(CLICKS TONGUE)

08:04.117 --> 08:07.552
How could you let him
accept a job
and be part of the world?

08:07.554 --> 08:08.420
I didn't do anything.
It was easy.

08:08.422 --> 08:11.256
It's fine.
I'll just wait it out until
he quits or gets fired.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.759
Or he'll learn
responsibility and pride
from a job well done.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.027
Oh, shut the (BLEEP) up,
Murray.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.330
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my parents</i>
<i> debated my new job,</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:20.966
<i> Erica was settling into hers.</i>

08:20.968 --> 08:22.000
Welcome to Spencer's.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.168
Shopping for anything
in particular?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.804
We're looking for party favors
for Billy's birthday.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.539
I'm turning this much!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.508
Okay...
Whatever that is.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.176
Well, we have
great stuff for kids.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.912
Balloons, fake tattoos,
bouncy balls.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.680
Boring! (CHUCKLES)

08:35.682 --> 08:38.650
Let me guess, William,
you like poo-poo?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.218
You like fake barf?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.521
You like big ol' farts?
Yes!

08:42.523 --> 08:44.456
Then come with me,
'cause you're gonna have

08:44.458 --> 08:46.892
the best birthday
farty ever!

08:46.894 --> 08:48.026
Yay!

08:48.028 --> 08:49.094
BARRY: Let's go, little man.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.429
I know you were worried
about your brother,

08:51.431 --> 08:52.864
but he's actually
doing great.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.301
I'd say he's really embraced
the spirit of Spencer's.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.970
Yeah, well,
he's not the only one.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.505
Watch this.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.974
Hey, handsome.
Welcome to Spencer's.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.409
Can I help you
with anything?

09:04.411 --> 09:05.744
Nah, just kinda browsing.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.846
Dude! You like chicks?

09:07.848 --> 09:08.847
Um... Yeah.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.048
I'm kind of
talking to one.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.116
Yeah, he's kind of
talking to one.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.819
What about chicks in bikinis
sun tanning on
rad sports cars?

09:14.821 --> 09:17.556
Isn't that better
than this dud?
Yeah, probably.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.690
Then step to your right

09:18.692 --> 09:20.759
and check out
our sweet posters!

09:20.761 --> 09:21.960
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And for the first time,</i>

09:21.962 --> 09:23.895
<i> Barry was</i>
<i> Out-Spencering Erica.</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:25.664
My Lord,
look at that boy!

09:25.666 --> 09:29.768
Scooping up every super car
and boobie poster we got.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.535
Just doing my job, sir.

09:30.537 --> 09:33.338
I know this is a small detour
on your way to becoming

09:33.340 --> 09:36.441
a big-time brain surgeon,
but how would you like

09:36.443 --> 09:38.276
to be assistant manager?
BOTH: What?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.079
I've been looking for somebody
to help me run this place.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.447
I found him.
What do you say?

09:42.449 --> 09:44.482
I say you're gonna be
out of business in two weeks.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.884
Thank you
for this opportunity.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.286
Erica, your brilliant
brother's in charge.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.790
Now, I'm gonna go
lose myself in a Cinnabon.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.058
BARRY: Well, well, well.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.227
Looks like the master
has become the student.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.128
That's not the expression.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.698
It is now,
'cause Barry's the boss.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.768
And the Boss Barry says
clean all the dribble glasses

10:03.770 --> 10:05.937
and restock the fake turds.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.940
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica faced the wrath</i>
<i> of a new boss,</i>

10:08.942 --> 10:11.142
<i> I was facing bossy customers.</i>

10:11.144 --> 10:13.345
Hey, there.
Nine quarters, please.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.347
What's this?
It's my report card.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.715
I'm a straight-A student.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.782
But I go to school
with you,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.284
and the report cards
haven't come out yet.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.452
Then why am I holding one?

10:20.454 --> 10:21.252
That's from three years ago!

10:21.254 --> 10:24.422
Plus, those aren't A's.
They're F's
you turned into A's.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.324
Nuh-uh.
Look.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.392
A's don't have
right angles.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.328
You should know that
'cause you got an "A"
in geometry.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.997
Well, here's something
you should know.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.398
Give me
a fistful of quarters

10:33.400 --> 10:35.900
before I give you
a faceful of fist.

10:36.303 --> 10:36.935
(CLICKING)

10:36.937 --> 10:39.638
Oh, yeah,
she's got nine A's, too.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.338
What? No way!

10:40.340 --> 10:41.539
I've got my report card
right here.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.509
That's a napkin!
Less talking,
more clicking.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.111
(CLICKING)

10:46.113 --> 10:46.778
That's it.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.613
Look me in the eye
as you do it.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.949
Don't you look away!

10:54.121 --> 10:55.353
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Still day one at my new job,</i>

10:55.355 --> 10:58.590
<i> and I was already feeling</i>
<i> like it was "Game over."</i>

10:58.592 --> 10:59.924
Dude, where'd all
these people come from?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.960
Everybody heard
I was giving out free money!

11:01.962 --> 11:03.595
But that's not even
a report card!

11:03.597 --> 11:04.863
That's a Sbarro box!

11:04.865 --> 11:06.431
I know, Dave Kim!

11:06.433 --> 11:07.832
I've lost control.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.234
I'm gonna get fired.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.602
Oh, for sure.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.771
Ah, dang it!
I'm all out!

11:12.773 --> 11:13.838
You're gonna need
more quarters.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.142
Wait! I've got
all the quarters in the world!

11:17.144 --> 11:18.276
<i> I had the perfect plan.</i>

11:18.278 --> 11:20.011
<i> I would just borrow</i>
<i> a couple quarters</i>

11:20.013 --> 11:21.980
<i> from the machine.</i>
Free quarters!

11:21.982 --> 11:24.482
<i> Oh, God!</i>
<i> Not part of the plan!</i>

11:25.118 --> 11:26.685
What the hell
is going on?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.253
It's a funny story,
really.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.322
I gave out free money.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

11:31.324 --> 11:32.757
It's not funny.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.229
Okay. Those beer helmets
are clean enough.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.932
Go tidy up
the naughty novelty
section in the back.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.134
ERICA: No.
There's creepos over there.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.736
And they're not
buying anything.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.572
Erica, you're objecting
to a direct order

11:47.574 --> 11:48.473
from your superior.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.341
Know what would happen
if this was the army?

11:50.343 --> 11:53.111
Uh, this isn't the army.
We sell butt mugs.

11:53.113 --> 11:53.845
Watch yourself.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.915
Oh, Leon, I'm gonna need
the keys to the glass case.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.615
The glass case?

11:57.617 --> 12:00.318
With the pewter dragons
holding the crystal balls?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.654
I haven't opened this case
in years.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.423
Yeah, I saw this stupid
goth kid in the mall,

12:05.425 --> 12:09.060
and I said to myself,
"That kid'll buy a dragon."

12:09.062 --> 12:11.296
So I struck up a convo,
and he's coming in.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.031
Oh, my God.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.333
Son, you've got it.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.668
The gift.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.670
The Spencer's gift.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.238
Come on.
That's not a thing.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.140
(SNIFFLES)
This is a big moment for me.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.910
(LAUGHING) I-I've never
said this before.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.645
You can lock up tonight.
You sure?

12:27.647 --> 12:31.216
I've never been more sure
about anything in my life.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.818
You!

12:34.054 --> 12:35.520
Learn from him.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.988
He has the gift.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.289
Spencer's gift, sure.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.858
BARRY: Well,
would you look at that.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.359
First,
I'm made the boss.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.261
Now I get the keys
to the store.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.196
I don't even have
the keys to the house.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.732
I have to sit in the tree
until someone comes home!

12:47.734 --> 12:48.867
I have to hand it to you,

12:48.869 --> 12:50.368
you really did
out-spencer gifts me.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.837
Eh, don't feel bad.
Not everyone has the gift.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.441
If anything,
I feel bad you don't get
to see Chuck Norris.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.343
Chuck Norris?
What about him?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.678
Oh, he's signing his new book
at B. Dalton.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.013
What's it called?

13:02.015 --> 13:02.614
Uh...

13:02.616 --> 13:04.649
"Punching America
in the throat."

13:04.651 --> 13:05.316
Damn it!

13:05.318 --> 13:07.085
Why are the two
most important things

13:07.087 --> 13:08.319
that ever happened
to me tonight?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.822
I guess...
I could cover for you.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.390
Thank you, Erica.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.025
You know,
you're not a good employee,

13:14.027 --> 13:15.827
but you're
an average sister.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.363
ADULT ADAM:<i> Erica knew</i>
<i> that in order to beat Barry,</i>

13:18.365 --> 13:19.864
<i> she'd have to play dirty.</i>

13:19.866 --> 13:22.901
<i> Meanwhile, I had to clean up</i>
<i> the mess I made at work.</i>

13:22.903 --> 13:23.601
It was terrible.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.370
They shook me down
for all my quarters.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.338
Was one dressed
like a ditzy redhead

13:27.340 --> 13:30.241
and the other like
a smart-alec shoeshiner?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.477
Albert, not everything
is a grift.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.978
Face it, Mom was right.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.680
I'm not qualified
to do anything

13:35.682 --> 13:37.315
besides make
stupid home movies.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.384
We can fix this, together.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.952
How much
they get you for?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.486
$110.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.787
You're gonna fix this
on your own.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.855
Fine.
I'll think of something.

13:43.857 --> 13:44.789
Just don't tell Mom
I got fired.

13:44.791 --> 13:49.294
Yes! I heard everything,
thanks to Barry's
stupid giant ear.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.030
Our Hollywood dreams
are back on the table.

13:52.032 --> 13:52.630
(GROANS)
(CHUCKLES)

13:52.632 --> 13:55.600
Mom, you got to stop.
I just lost a real job.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.035
You know
what else is real?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.337
You walking me
down the red carpet

13:59.339 --> 13:59.971
at the Academy Awards.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.707
To be clear,
if I ever get a job
in show business,

14:02.709 --> 14:05.543
I am not taking you
as my date to anything.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.478
Of course you are.
(SCOFFS) I'm super not.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.981
Well, who else
are you gonna take?
Um, my wife?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.316
Oh, it's cool.
She'll understand.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.318
No, she won't.
I'll talk to her.
She'll get it.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.320
You stay away from her.
Seriously.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.521
She didn't sign up
for this.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.590
So, what, I'm the only one
who believes in you,

14:18.592 --> 14:19.991
but I have to read
about your successes

14:19.993 --> 14:23.161
in<i> People</i> magazine,
like some poor slob
at a dentist's office?

14:23.163 --> 14:25.263
I'll tell you before
the article comes out, okay?

14:25.265 --> 14:28.366
If I pay back the arcade,
can I go to the Oscars then?

14:28.368 --> 14:31.069
You can ride with me
and my wife in the limo,

14:31.071 --> 14:33.671
but you can't go in.
I'll find a way.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.440
No! You're not
bailing him out of this.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.475
This is his job,
not yours.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.644
You got to find a way
to solve it on your own.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.014
And I just did,
by trading in my
future happiness for cash.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.450
Here's your money,
plus a little extra

14:45.452 --> 14:47.252
because you're
a special boy.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.553
Hey, my special-boy money!

14:48.555 --> 14:49.687
I'm gonna be brutal here

14:49.689 --> 14:51.122
because your mom's
in la-la land.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.259
You're not a boy,
and you're not special!

14:54.261 --> 14:55.426
What are you saying?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.528
He's not
some magic star.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.963
He's a regular Joe

14:58.965 --> 15:02.100
who's got to learn the value
of a hard day's work.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.569
By wearing wigs
and making home movies.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.071
Oh, my God!
What are you
doing to this kid?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.106
I'm being his mother.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.707
Well, I'm being his father.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.009
Welcome to reality.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.744
You go down to that job,

15:12.746 --> 15:15.380
and you solve it
any way you can!

15:19.920 --> 15:21.352
Solve it!

15:22.589 --> 15:23.488
What a rip!

15:23.490 --> 15:24.923
Chuck Norris
wasn't even there,

15:24.925 --> 15:26.791
just some lady
named Maya Angelou.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.693
She didn't know anything
about karate.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.129
Barry. We need to talk.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.864
Leon.
What are you doing back?

15:32.866 --> 15:35.333
Someone paged me
to come back to the store.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.336
When I got here,
you were gone...

15:38.338 --> 15:40.004
And so were
all the bottled farts.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.940
Oh, no!
Not the bottled farts!

15:41.942 --> 15:42.707
Yes, the bottled farts.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.743
When I saw all the
bottled farts were gone,
I was excited.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.545
I thought you sold
the bottled farts.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.648
But now it seems
you lost the bottled farts.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.050
I'd never lose
the bottled farts.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.686
Barry, do you understand
that each bottled fart

15:54.688 --> 15:58.056
was ass-crafted
by a third-generation fartist

15:58.058 --> 15:59.190
in Pueblo, Colorado?

15:59.192 --> 16:00.725
So they just fart
into the bottles?

16:00.727 --> 16:03.328
Oh, it's so much more
than that.

16:03.330 --> 16:08.366
Inside every bottled fart
lives a child's wish.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.102
And now all those wishes
have vanished,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.305
like...
Something in the wind.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.606
A squeaky fart?

16:15.608 --> 16:16.307
Damn it.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.910
No one gets it
like you, Barry.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.612
But I still need
that name tag.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.350
Wait! You can't fire him
for just losing some farts.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.885
It's not about the farts.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.488
It's about trust.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.591
You broke my heart, son.

16:34.728 --> 16:35.360
You did this.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.895
You couldn't deal
with the fact that
I was better than you,

16:37.897 --> 16:41.666
that I was good at something,
that I'll be a doctor one day.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.102
Barry...
No! Just don't talk to me.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.440
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My arcade job was a bust,</i>

16:49.442 --> 16:51.909
<i> but I had the perfect way</i>
<i> to get my money back.</i>

16:51.911 --> 16:54.312
Yo, ponytail!
Give me my damn money!

16:54.314 --> 16:56.214
No.
Okay, that didn't work.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.516
Please do the right thing
and give me my money.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.753
I've considered your offer,
and I have a counteroffer.

17:01.755 --> 17:02.120
Eat my butt.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.389
I totally thought
you were gonna do
the right thing,

17:04.391 --> 17:05.323
and then
you offered your butt!

17:05.325 --> 17:07.992
Can you guys please
just give me the money back?

17:07.994 --> 17:10.395
Sorry, man.
I need that money
to feed my family.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.263
Really?
No. My dad's a lawyer.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.165
He has that commercial
where he wears a neck brace

17:14.167 --> 17:16.768
and tells you his number is
dos dos dos, dos dos dos,

17:16.770 --> 17:17.702
dos dos dos dos.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.204
Wait! That's it!
I know how to fix this!

17:20.206 --> 17:21.706
Is it by you giving us
more quarters?

17:21.708 --> 17:25.076
No, but what if I told you
I could make you stars?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.879
Johnny's already a star.
You're a star, Johnny.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.881
I know, girl.
Everybody knows.

17:29.883 --> 17:30.515
So, you'll do it?

17:30.517 --> 17:33.151
Sure. But I got
two questions for you.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.619
Can I play my sax?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.888
And how loud
can I play my sax?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.156
(MUSIC PLAYING)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.190
<i> Yeah!</i>

17:39.192 --> 17:41.292
<i> Do you like video games?</i>

17:41.294 --> 17:42.427
<i> Do you like girls?</i>

17:42.429 --> 17:45.596
<i> Do you like girls</i>
<i> who like video games?</i>

17:46.032 --> 17:46.998
<i> Hey, big boy.</i>

17:47.000 --> 17:49.233
<i> How 'bout we make that</i>
<i> two-player?</i>

17:49.235 --> 17:50.535
<i> Well, all right.</i>

17:50.537 --> 17:53.004
<i> Come on down</i>
<i> to Challenges Arcade.</i>

17:53.006 --> 17:57.508
<i> All the latest games,</i>
<i> from Asteroids to Zaxxon.</i>

17:57.510 --> 17:59.243
<i> Did somebody say</i>
<i> "Zaxxon"?</i>

17:59.245 --> 18:01.379
<i> More like sax-on.</i>

18:01.381 --> 18:03.414
(SAXOPHONE SOLO)

18:04.584 --> 18:07.351
Dude, this commercial's
gonna be awesome.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.954
Commercial, huh?
Not a bad idea.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.656
And it can be yours
for only $5,000.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.827
How about no dollars
and you can have
your job back?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.562
Deal.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.631
Hey.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.666
Go away, fart thief.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.901
Well, maybe
this will cheer you up.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.604
Huh? Whoopee cushion?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.338
Bug in an ice cube?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.574
Even though all those
items are hilarious,

18:29.576 --> 18:31.576
you can't make up
for what you did.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.111
(SIGHS)

18:34.647 --> 18:36.214
Okay, fine.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.049
I paged Leon, and...

18:38.051 --> 18:42.019
I hid all of the
stinky bottles
in the stockroom.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.323
I did it
because I was jealous.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.459
You're better at
Spencer's Gifts than me.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.260
And I'm sorry.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.028
I-I don't want
another gag gift.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.864
No, it's a real one.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.601
<i> (TRUE COLORS</i> PLAYING)

18:56.603 --> 18:59.704
A stethoscope?
For when you're a doctor.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.606
You don't believe that.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.841
Look, I know I'm always
really hard on you,

19:03.843 --> 19:06.410
but watching you at that job
made me see

19:06.412 --> 19:09.447
that when you're passionate
about something,

19:09.549 --> 19:11.215
you can do anything.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.751
So you're gonna be a doctor,
all right?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.722
And a damn good one.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.391
You may not be
a good employee,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.326

<i> Willow Grove Park Mall.</i>

19:27.467 --> 19:29.000
Is this going on TV?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.468
My boss bought
local air time,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.436
and now the manager
of Spencer's Gifts

19:32.438 --> 19:34.505
wants me to shoot one
for him, too.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.307
Oh, my baby!

19:36.309 --> 19:38.376
Told you, Murray!
He is special!

19:38.378 --> 19:40.978
That's his job,
being amazing!

19:40.980 --> 19:44.248
You know, I think
I'm gonna keep my actual job
at the arcade.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.283
What?
Truth is, without it,

19:45.285 --> 19:48.386
I never would have gotten
my first real directing gig.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.354
Dad's right,
a real job is a good thing.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.224
Well, you're still gonna
take me to the Oscars,
though, right?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.392
I'm taking my wife.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.826
You'll take me

Eh, I'm taking my wife.

Sure you are.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.932
Bevy.

20:00.934 --> 20:01.766
Fine. I'll stop.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.368
You know, your mom
may be onto something.

20:04.370 --> 20:08.839
You might be more special
than I'm giving you
credit for.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.707
You really think so?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.742
Don't get a big head
about it.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.011
But, yeah,
keep making your movies

20:14.013 --> 20:16.981
with the, uh,
singing and the wigs.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.549
I thought you hate the wigs.

Oh, I...
I really hate the wigs.
