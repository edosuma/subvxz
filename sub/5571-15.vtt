WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.005
We got to hurry up.
Bell's in ten minutes.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.007
School's a block away.
Relax.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.408
We can't be late.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.576
Ow.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.678
You okay?

00:12.679 --> 00:14.779
Yeah, no, there's a rock
or something stuck in my shoe.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.048
Oh.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.151
There. I got it.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.353
Thanks.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.289
What if your
mom drives by?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.058
(Sighs)

00:26.060 --> 00:27.459
Is this about my mother again?

00:27.461 --> 00:31.397
I can't help it.
She terrifies me.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.298
You know she's got
eyes everywhere.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.300
One misstep,
and I'll end up at gitmo.

00:35.302 --> 00:39.104
I think those video games
are making you paranoid.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.508
Hey, it's just a kiss, okay?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.343
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.745
Trust me.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.449
(Vehicle approaching)

00:51.419 --> 00:54.253
(Tires screech)

00:54.255 --> 00:56.205
Do not move!

00:56.206 --> 00:58.156
I didn't do anything. Stop!
We got a second there.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.158
Move.
Hey. Wait, wait!

00:59.160 --> 01:00.492
Inside!
Where are you taking us?

01:00.494 --> 01:02.428
Now!
Okay, okay, okay.
No!

01:02.430 --> 01:05.364
Package secure. Critical!
Let's go!
Go! Go!

01:05.366 --> 01:07.833
(Tires screeching)

01:07.835 --> 01:10.536
¶ ¶

01:44.572 --> 01:46.105
(elevator bell dings)

01:46.107 --> 01:48.841
Hey. What, did you grind
those beans yourself?

01:48.843 --> 01:51.510
What Tony means
is thank you, McGee.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.679
You are welcome.
Hmm.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.647
Oh, you forgot one
for Gibbs.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.416
(Tony and McGee chuckle)

01:57.418 --> 01:59.118
(Chuckles) What?

01:59.120 --> 02:00.752
Oh, sweet probie. So naive.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.720
(Chuckles)

02:01.722 --> 02:04.139
Gibbs isn't coming to this.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.557
Uh, but director Vance said
the advanced tactical session

02:06.560 --> 02:08.760
is mandatory.
Right. And when was

02:08.762 --> 02:11.196
the last time you saw Gibbs
do anything mandatory?
You know, maybe he's got

02:11.198 --> 02:12.331
the right idea.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.599
I mean, look at us.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.434
I am
a particularly seasoned agent.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.902
I could probably teach
this class.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.871
Technically, you couldn't.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.240
Only NCIS agents
from the regional

02:21.242 --> 02:23.242
enforcement action
capabilities team

02:23.244 --> 02:25.177
are authorized
to be instructors.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.913
Oh, look at you, with
all the textbook fancy stuff.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.548
All right,
I'll make you a bet.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.450
By the end
of our little training session,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.685
they're gonna want me to lead
this react team.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.854
Unless they have
an age limit.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.855
(Elevator bell dings)

02:38.259 --> 02:40.259
Timothy farragut McGee,

02:40.261 --> 02:41.260
you are a sight

02:41.262 --> 02:42.761
for sore eyes.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.862
Val?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.931
Wow.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.233
Farragut? I knew
he had a middle name.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.935
Oh, my god. What-what
are you doing in D.C.?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.904
I'm leading
this training session.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.939
Wait, when did you join react?
Six months ago,

02:53.941 --> 02:56.175
after I finished my tour
in Afghanistan.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.177
Traded one unit for another.
You know what,
that makes

02:58.179 --> 03:00.812
a lot of sense, 'cause you were
always up for a challenge.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.247
You being my favorite.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.348
Oh, well, thank you.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.316
(Clears throat)

03:04.318 --> 03:05.284
Hi.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.485
We're over here.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.953
Sorry. Uh,
Tony, bishop,

03:07.955 --> 03:11.190
meet, uh, NCIS special
agent Valerie page.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.958
Oh. Tim's told me all about you.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.460
Nice to put the faces
to the names.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.629
How do you two
know each other?
Oh, we go way back.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.365
We're both Navy brats.
Yeah, we... our
parents were stationed

03:20.367 --> 03:22.534
on the same bases together.
Rota, Alameda...

03:22.536 --> 03:24.636
And don't forget Japan.
(Chuckles)
Right.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.737
(Chuckles)

03:25.739 --> 03:27.873
Fond memories.
(Chuckles)

03:27.875 --> 03:29.208
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>

03:29.210 --> 03:29.975
(Chuckles)

03:29.977 --> 03:31.476
Sorry. Continue.
(Phone chimes)

03:31.478 --> 03:34.947
Ooh, that's me.

03:34.949 --> 03:37.216
(Phones chiming)

03:37.218 --> 03:39.218
It's all of us.
What is it?

03:39.220 --> 03:40.586
Secnav's daughter's
been kidnapped.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.824
Well, my headache
just got worse.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.726
Ah. The ever-chipper

03:47.728 --> 03:49.394
special agent fornell.
Rough start to the morning.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.830
Didn't even get
my cup of coffee.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.000
Give me that.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.835
(Gulps)

03:56.837 --> 03:58.904
What the hell is that?

03:58.906 --> 03:59.955
It's herbal tea.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.005
Desmond?
Yes, sir.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.441
Would you toss that?
You got it.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.010
Agent fornell,
have you seen Gibbs?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.845
He's with secretary Porter.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.314
So, what do we know?
At 0750,

04:09.316 --> 04:12.751
a neighbor witnessed
Megan Porter and a classmate,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.037
Dean Campbell,

04:15.038 --> 04:17.322
being forced into a black SUV
by armed assailants.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.925
Any luck getting a GPS fix
on either of their cells?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.460
We checked that.
They're both turned off.
Bishop: I'll call Abby,

04:21.462 --> 04:23.528
see if she can turn them back
on remotely.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.631
Has there been any communication
with the kidnappers?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.632
It's too soon.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.666
They'll settle somewhere first.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.468
They'll probably make contact

04:29.470 --> 04:31.336
within the next 12 hours.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.804
Any idea who's behind it?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.674
Somebody with as high a profile
as the secretary of the Navy?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.377
How much time you got?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.047
(Recorded): Hi, this is Megan.
Sorry I missed your call...

04:42.049 --> 04:45.050
(Sighs) Megan's phone
keeps going to voicemail.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.620
Whoever took her knew
we'd trace it.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.621
Well,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.323
I have to keep trying.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.359
Has her father been contacted?

04:54.361 --> 04:55.360
I called him

04:55.362 --> 04:57.362
as soon as I got word.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.364
He's on a business trip
in New York.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.033
He's on his way back.
Megan mention seeing

05:01.035 --> 05:02.634
anyone suspicious
over the past few weeks?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.819
No.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.003
Did she say anything
about being followed?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.355
No.

05:06.356 --> 05:07.706
Nothing like that.
This classmate,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.441
Dean Campbell,
what do you know about him?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.542
Everything.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.311
I had
my personal security assistant

05:12.313 --> 05:14.613
check him out a few months ago.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.381
He's dating my daughter.
I had to have him vetted.
What do you know

05:16.383 --> 05:17.549
about his family?
Dean's parents

05:17.551 --> 05:19.551
are curators at the Smithsonian.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.554
I hardly think
they're cause for concern.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.390
Pardon me. Boss, can we talk?

05:25.392 --> 05:27.326
Hi, this is Megan.
Sorry I missed your call...

05:27.328 --> 05:29.728
Abby reactivated
Dean Campbell's cell phone.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.798
It's pinging at a location
five miles from here.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.376
Front's clear.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.579
Back's clear.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.448
It's been bleached.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.716
(Muffled screaming)

05:53.587 --> 05:55.887
It's Dean.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.726
(Grunting, panting)

06:02.663 --> 06:04.830
(Panting):
They have her.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.398
They have Megan.
Where'd they take her?

06:06.400 --> 06:09.134
I don't know.
I tried to stop them,

06:09.136 --> 06:10.569
I swear.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.371
Please,

06:12.373 --> 06:13.505
you got to find her.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.507
Why would they
leave Dean behind?

06:15.509 --> 06:18.977
He wasn't part
of the plan.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.421
So much for catching up.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.423
How long you sticking
around D.C.?

06:31.425 --> 06:33.859
Only until I get your team's
training out of the way.

06:33.861 --> 06:37.696
Well, under the circumstances,
that may take a while.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.931
(Chuckling):
Hey.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.934
So, giving your childhood bff
the grand tour?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.169
Well, I've been here before.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.538
Are these walls more orange
than I remember?

06:46.540 --> 06:49.040
So, what was it like
being military kids,

06:49.042 --> 06:51.443
moving to a new base
every few years?

06:51.445 --> 06:53.145
It had its ups and downs.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.147
Got to meet a few nice people
along the way.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.048
Yeah. Plus, we got
to travel the world.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.861
Yeah.

06:58.862 --> 07:00.673
Do you remember
our train ride to Austria?

07:00.674 --> 07:02.485
Oh, yes, I do. I still have
those lederhosen, by the way.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.789
(Chuckling):
Oh.
Whoa,

07:03.791 --> 07:05.023
Timothy Von trapp.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.992
I can see you frolicking
in the hills.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.494
You must have driven
those frauleins crazy.

07:09.496 --> 07:12.130
Oh. The girls on the base
did have a nickname for him.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.499
Mcstudmuffin.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.735
What? Really?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.569
Really.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.703
It's like we've entered

07:18.705 --> 07:19.938
the twilight zone.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.040
Give me an update.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.141
Ah. Yes, the SUV used
in the kidnapping was stolen.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.179
Reported yesterday
from a residence in Chevy chase.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.214
Abby's processing it
for prints now.
McGee: Spoke with

07:29.216 --> 07:30.749
director Vance at the summit
in Brussels.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.184
He wants
to be updated hourly.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.185
Dean Campbell?
Bishop: Released
from the hospital

07:33.187 --> 07:34.586
and his parents
brought him here.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.154
I escorted them
to the conference room.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.189
You two, go.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.691
Where are we on suspects?

07:39.693 --> 07:40.759
It's a pretty wide net, boss.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.826
We need some time
to narrow it down.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.994
I could lend a hand.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.496
NCIS special agent Valerie page,

07:44.498 --> 07:45.897
from the northeast field office.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.066
I'm instructing your team's
advanced tactics training.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.836
She's actually part
of NCIS's react unit.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.771
They're-they're trained
for high-risk cases like this.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.906
I think we should loop 'em
in, you know, being react.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.908
Regional enforcement...

07:56.910 --> 07:58.910
I know what it means.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.513
We got it covered.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
But seeing as I'm stuck here,

08:01.515 --> 08:03.148
you might as well
put me to work.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.749
Couldn't hurt to have
another agent lending a hand,

08:04.751 --> 08:06.151
could it?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.519
We'll see.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.492
I think he likes you.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.026
Some of it's still a blur.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.561
Just tell us
what you can remember.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.996
Did you see how many there were?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.599
Three men got out
and grabbed us.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.268
There was another one up front,
the driver.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.537
Anyone in the passenger seat?
I don't think so.

08:25.539 --> 08:29.107
But when we pulled over,
someone was waiting for them.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.809
That's when I got knocked out.
What about

08:30.811 --> 08:32.277
any distinguishing
characteristics--

08:32.279 --> 08:34.980
accents? Tattoos?
No.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.516
But I am positive
that they were military trained.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.984
Special forces, even.
What makes you

08:38.986 --> 08:41.052
say that?
The shorthand they used.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.955
"Copy that," "exfil," "klicks"--
that sort of thing.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.056
Plus, they were
each strapped

08:45.058 --> 08:47.125
with a sig sauer mark-25

08:47.127 --> 08:50.629
with a surefire x300 light
mounted on the picatinny rail.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.668
<i> Specops ten: Echo force?</i>

08:58.238 --> 09:00.872
It's one of the guns
in the video game.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.047
Secnav?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.082
Inside. She asked for a minute.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.584
Anything from the kidnappers?

09:12.586 --> 09:14.052
Radio silence.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.888
(Indistinct shouting)

09:16.890 --> 09:18.890
(Sighs) We're wasting time.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.092
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.828
Secnav's inside
with her ex-husband

09:23.830 --> 09:25.597
and his girlfriend.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.600
Porter: I have agents working
around the clock on this!

09:28.602 --> 09:30.135
Man:
That's not good enough!

09:30.137 --> 09:31.937
Makes me miss Diane.
Porter: Richard,

09:31.939 --> 09:33.572
we're done here.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.340
Gentlemen, I apologize.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.609
Please come in.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.581
Agents Gibbs and fornell,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.650
this is Richard Porter,
uh, my daughter's father,

09:45.652 --> 09:47.152
and his partner, justine wolfe.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.321
I'm tired of meeting
agent after agent.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.655
None of 'em have any answers.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.691
Richard, calm down.
They're on our side.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.293
Our side? Trust me, you'd do
well to stay out of this.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.128
Don't threaten her, Sarah.
I'm not threatening
her, Richard.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.730
Justine:
Enough, okay? Everyone's
on edge. Let's just...

09:58.732 --> 10:00.515
Just take a breath.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.299
Were you able to get
any more detail from Dean?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.302
He described the assailants
as military trained.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.605
This could be
politically motivated.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.039
(Scoffs) I knew the moment
you took this job,

10:08.041 --> 10:09.808
our daughter's life
would be in danger.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.811
I mean, how many times did I say
Megan needed a security detail?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.179
It wasn't protocol.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.947
To hell with protocol.
My daughter's been abducted.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.116
Richard, stop.
You're not helping matters.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.351
Time is a critical factor

10:19.353 --> 10:21.653
in situations like this,
madam secretary.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.655
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.990
Once I took office,

10:24.992 --> 10:26.324
I recommended base closures,

10:26.326 --> 10:28.994
I denied companies
government contracts,

10:28.996 --> 10:30.996
and I made changes
to military policy.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.998
Every decision creates
new enemies.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.333
How specific
do you want me to get?

10:35.335 --> 10:37.369
What about within the
special operations community?

10:37.371 --> 10:40.205
Well, once the combat exclusion
policy was lifted,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.307
I ordered all fields
opened to women.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.593
But old roots run deep,

10:44.594 --> 10:46.878
and there were a few
in naval special warfare command

10:46.880 --> 10:48.380
who pushed back.

10:48.382 --> 10:49.381
How hard?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.250
One officer chose

10:52.252 --> 10:54.319
to speak out publicly
against my decision.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.087
And with the full support
of the Navy,

10:56.089 --> 10:58.123
he was relieved of his command.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.925
Who?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.726
Commander Christian brodrick.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.432
So what do you think
of the northeast?
It's cold.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.968
I can't handle another
snowpocalypse, snowmageddon,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.736
or some other snow disaster,
you know?

11:11.738 --> 11:13.438
I'm ready
for something different.
Of course.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.441
Still the same. Never liked to
stay in one place for too long.

11:16.443 --> 11:20.679
First, you were gen crim,
then agent afloat,

11:20.681 --> 11:23.014
then deployed
with the troops overseas,

11:23.016 --> 11:24.382
and now you're part
of the react team.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.784
You know, it's kind
of hard to keep up.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.019
Yeah, well, it's in my blood.
What about you?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.354
13 years at headquarters.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.956
You must be itching to leave.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.258
Actually, I'm not.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.026
No, I'm happy, you know?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.428
My team is my family.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.463
It's actually really nice
to put down roots.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.031
You should try it sometime.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.166
Don't hold your breath.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.369
(Grunting)

11:47.207 --> 11:49.140
Christian brodrick.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.375
Hi.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.877
NCIS. We'd like to ask you
a few questions

11:52.879 --> 11:54.913
about your falling out
with secretary Porter.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.081
I wouldn't call it
a falling out.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.000
Page:
What would you call

11:58.001 --> 11:59.918
being relieved of duty
and forced into retirement?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.287
Inevitable.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.388
Enlightenment.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.390
Refreshing.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.792
Where were you this morning
between 7:00 and 8:00 A.M.?

12:07.794 --> 12:08.860
At my house.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.328
Why? What's this all about?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.864
The secretary of the Navy's
daughter has been abducted.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.065
My god.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.433
That's awful.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.969
And you think I had something
to do with it?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.104
Did you?
No, ma'am.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.905
Secnav and I had
differing views.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.907
When I voiced my concerns
over her plan,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.809
I never should've done it
so publicly.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.010
It was insubordinate.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.879
She was just doing her job.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.048
I don't harbor any ill will
towards her for that.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.267
Do you know anyone
who might have?

12:32.268 --> 12:34.485
The men I serve with are
the men I trusted with my life.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.921
I will not besmirch
any of their good names

12:36.923 --> 12:38.523
with speculation.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.025
Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.498
(Siren chirps)

12:46.500 --> 12:48.266
Alongi, take the front.
Sir.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.768
Cruz...

12:49.770 --> 12:51.269
You're on roving patrol.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.845
Ma'am.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.516
(Sighs)

13:04.518 --> 13:07.018
Are all of you in<i> every</i> room?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.520
I can leave.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.155
I'm-I'm sorry. It's fine.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.923
(Clears throat)

13:11.925 --> 13:13.892
You made coffee?

13:16.863 --> 13:18.396
(Sets cup down)
Uh-huh.

13:18.398 --> 13:22.233
Well, to be honest, I could use
something a little stronger.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.868
Your liquor cabinet's locked.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.839
You know, i-I've had days
where I felt like

13:27.841 --> 13:29.541
the world's worst parent,

13:29.543 --> 13:31.843
but today solidifies my reign.
There's nothing

13:31.845 --> 13:34.179
you could've done.
That's a lie,
and we both know it.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.914
My daughter
was targeted

13:35.916 --> 13:38.149
because of who I am.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.885
And Richard was right
to blame me.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.587
He's scared.
So am I.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.590
And so is Megan.
And every second that passes,

13:45.592 --> 13:46.908
I can't help but think

13:46.909 --> 13:48.225
of what she must be
going through.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.863
Terrified and alone.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.097
And god knows where
they're keeping her

13:53.099 --> 13:54.566
or if she's hurt...

13:54.568 --> 13:55.834
We're gonna find your daughter

13:55.836 --> 13:57.101
and we're gonna bring her home.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.469
(Phone rings)

13:58.471 --> 13:59.838
Fornell: Run the trace.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.005
It's a blocked call.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.874
That's them.
We're starting the trace.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.875
Remember what
we talked about.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.010
Stay calm,
keep him talking.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.013
Hello?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.148
Man: You've been very patient

14:10.150 --> 14:11.583
waiting for my call,
madam secretary.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.852
As have the agents
waiting with you.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.922
I want to speak to my daughter.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.858
You're not in a position
to make demands.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.092
Rest assured Megan is fine.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.928
Whether she stays that way
is up to you.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.565
What is it that you want?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.534
Your attention. Do I have it?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.236
Yes.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.204
Good. 'Cause if you want
to see your daughter again,

14:33.206 --> 14:34.639
it'll cost you
ten million dollars.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.875
You have 24 hours.

14:36.877 --> 14:37.942
(Line disconnects)

14:41.581 --> 14:43.414
Excuse me.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.218
Ransom money.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.621
So much for being
politically motivated.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.489
If that's all
they're after,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.324
why target Secnav?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.570
(Elevator bell dings)

15:05.572 --> 15:08.139
(Sighs heavily)
So, what do you got, Abbs?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.407
Tony, what are you doing here?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.575
I didn't call you.
I'm not ready.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.476
What do you mean?
You're always ready.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.011
Ooh. Salt in my wound.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.412
I like the tie-dye.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.080
(Groans) Well,

15:16.082 --> 15:18.149
the kidnappers bleach bomb

15:18.151 --> 15:20.084
not only destroyed
my favorite coveralls,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.353
but also eliminated
every bit of evidence.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.421
You got nothing?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.057
I've been over it
three times now,

15:26.059 --> 15:27.992
and... there's nothing.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.929
No DNA, no prints,
nothing, nada.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.697
This thing is cleaner
than my lab.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.132
Nothing is cleaner
than your lab.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.967
Aw. Well, I would
give you a hug,

15:35.969 --> 15:37.335
but I don't want to turn
your nice suit

15:37.337 --> 15:38.703
into a Jackson pollock.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.204
I appreciate that.
Okay.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.073
Maybe fourth time's
the charm.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.009
Hey, one more thing.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.944
What do you know
about special agent page?

15:45.946 --> 15:48.112
McGee's special agent page?
Aha. What does that mean?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.731
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

15:49.732 --> 15:51.349
What do you mean by that?
Abby. You know something.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.319
I know about her front tooth,
and I've said enough already.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.687
Mm. Abby?
Look,

15:55.689 --> 15:57.322
page is just...

15:57.324 --> 16:00.024
A part of McGee's history.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.259
Now shoo.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
I have to get back to work.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.562
"Shoo," said the shoe-tail. Hm.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.532
Okay, well, then I guess
i won't be able to tell you

16:07.534 --> 16:10.001
the middle name McGee's
been holding out on us.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.436
Farragut.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.406
(Trilling, elevator bell dings)

16:18.244 --> 16:20.311
(Elevator bell dings)
Does everybody know?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.448
Got it. Thanks.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.651
FBI tracked the ransom call
to a burner phone

16:26.653 --> 16:29.554
purchased at a Baltimore
gas station in cash.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.322
Any security footage?
No such luck.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.158
Well, same with
Christian brodrick here.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.494
Alibi checks out.
Three of his neighbors saw him

16:36.496 --> 16:38.429
walking his dogs during the time
of the kidnapping.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.497
Could brodrick
be orchestrating it

16:39.499 --> 16:41.332
from behind the scenes?
I doubt it.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.701
Besides the fact that he's got
a glowing service record,

16:43.703 --> 16:47.005
he comes from a family
with some pretty serious money.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.039
Look at this.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.040
Bishop: Whoa.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.341
That's a lot of zeroes.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.410
If he wanted
ten million dollars,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.145
he wouldn't have had to go
that far to find it.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.580
Neither would Secnav.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.181
What'd you find?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.716
Megan Porter had
a kidnap-and-ransom policy

16:58.718 --> 17:01.652
taken out on her three years ago
by Secnav herself.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.222
For how much?
Exactly ten million dollars.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.725
Porter:
What exactly are you implying?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.727
Gibbs: The ransom number
is not a coincidence.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.163
Fornell: Someone knew about
the policy you had on Megan.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.098
Wait a second.
So this is true?

17:14.100 --> 17:16.167
You took out a ten million
dollar insurance policy

17:16.169 --> 17:17.502
on our daughter?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.587
It's standard
operating procedure

17:19.588 --> 17:21.671
for all key government officials
and their children, Richard.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.408
And you didn't feel the need
to discuss this with<i> me,</i>

17:23.410 --> 17:24.375
her father?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.743
(Phone rings)

17:25.745 --> 17:27.278
It's them.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.613
Why so soon?
It hasn't been 24 hours.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.548
Someone's moving up
the timeline.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.050
Yes?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.284
Man: Do you have the money?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.619
First let me talk
to my daughter.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.521
Not until we get what we want.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.625
What are you doing?

17:40.627 --> 17:43.594
He's testing you. Push back--
let him know you're serious.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.596
Are you out of your mind?
What if he doesn't call back?

17:45.598 --> 17:46.497
He will.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.605
(Phone rings)

17:54.607 --> 17:56.541
Hello?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.309
Mom?
Megan.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.244
Mom, please,
i-i want to come home.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.213
Megan, honey, listen to me.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.181
Everything's gonna be okay,
i promise.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.818
Megan?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.386
Man: I hope you keep your word,
madam secretary.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.190
You'll have your money.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.624
2:00 P.M. the fountain
at the Haverford mall.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.693
You hand over the ransom,
I'll hand over your daughter.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.462
And no police.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.596
They only complicate matters.
(Line disconnects)

18:22.202 --> 18:25.169
Tony: The shopping center
has 22 consumer access points,

18:25.171 --> 18:27.371
not including the parking
structure and service areas.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.207
Fornell: We'll have
multiple agents surveilling

18:29.209 --> 18:30.608
both the interior
and the exterior.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.410
McGee and bishop.
McGee is placing trackers

18:32.412 --> 18:34.445
in the ransom bag,
and bishop's linking up

18:34.447 --> 18:35.646
with the mall security feed.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.515
DiNozzo, you run point
from MTAC with bishop.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.884
McGee and I'll be on the ground
with eyes on fornell.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.887
Once I make the exchange
and retrieve Megan,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.288
you'll move in.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.124
The hell you are.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.692
What kind of game
are you playing?

18:47.693 --> 18:49.259
They said they wanted<i> me </i>
to drop off the money.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.295
I'm here, and I fully intend
on doing so.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.430
No, we can't let
you do that.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.397
Let me?
I don't take orders

18:53.399 --> 18:55.299
from you, agent Gibbs.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.735
You are a walking file
of classified information.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.771
Putting you at risk means
we risk countless others.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.407
They want the ransom money,
not military intelligence.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.742
We don't even know who they are.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.878
Gibbs is right-- it's
a threat to national security.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.513
Then who do you suggest
does make the exchange?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.648
They said no cops--
have you looked in the mirror?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.617
You look like an mp,
you look like a fed,

19:12.619 --> 19:14.218
and you look like
Sonny Crockett.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.154
don Johnson or Colin Farrell?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.589
They're gonna know
it's a setup.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.458
Not if I do it.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.626
If they were fine
with Megan's mother,

19:21.628 --> 19:23.694
they're not gonna mind
her father.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.763
Richard, these are
dangerous people.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.565
Who have our daughter.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.600
Getting her back
is all that matters.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.173
Tell me what I need to do.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.483
Tony (Over radio): Go for
the high and tight, McGee.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.585
Accentuate those
feminine features.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.886
Tony, I was a model.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.621
When you were undercover.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.822
And you failed at it.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.691
Why does everyone
keep forgetting this?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.594
Bishop: Comms check.
Gibbs, fornell, you read me?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.729
Copy that, loud and clear.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.665
With eyes on Porter.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.933
Copy that. Standing by.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.669
Where are we on the feed
from Porter's pin cam?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.204
Still working on it.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.405
There's some sort
of interference.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.506
Right, well, tick-tock.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.974
It's almost 2:00.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.911
(Sighs) It feels weird
to just stand here and watch.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.830
I'm too type a
for this.

20:15.831 --> 20:17.748
Tony: So what happened?
Gibbs give you the brush-off?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.284
I get the sense
he thinks I'm the enemy.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.586
Well, you're not.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.754
Unless you're one
of his ex-wives.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.590
Or a lawyer.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.460
Gibbs has been here since
Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark,

20:29.462 --> 20:31.329
and you show up
with your acronym

20:31.331 --> 20:33.564
telling him he needs help
doing his own job?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.299
But that's not what I've said.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.968
That's what he heard.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.403
(Sighs)
React agents are NCIS agents.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.938
We're on the same team.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.640
Gibbs' team is different.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.342
(Whispers):
So I've noticed.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.977
(Chuckles)

20:45.978 --> 20:47.611
(Sighs) Public takedowns
make me nervous.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.913
Too much of
a wildcard.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.448
Don't worry.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.882
Tim McGee's very
good at his job.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.784
I know-- Tim can
take care of himself.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.519
So can you,
from what I've heard.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.755
Oh. Why?
What did he tell you?

20:57.757 --> 21:00.258
He may have mentioned...

21:00.260 --> 21:03.861
The time you kissed that guy.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.296
I was undercover.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.433
Porter's camera's up.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.274
(Phone ringing)

21:17.644 --> 21:18.709
Here we go.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.414
Hello.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.066
Man: Where's secretary Porter?

21:25.067 --> 21:26.717
Well, there's been
a slight change in plans.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.386
But I have your money.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.388
This is a dangerous game
you're playing.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.556
No, no, no, no,
no tricks, no games.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.592
I just want my daughter.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.827
Take the stairs to the parking
structure, lower level.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.397
Go.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.699
Porter's on the move.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.002
¶ ¶

21:48.908 --> 21:51.442
okay, he's taking the stairs
to the lower level

21:51.444 --> 21:52.743
of the parking structure.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.580
Start walking down
until you see the red pickup.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.616
Looking for a red pickup.

22:01.721 --> 22:05.956
Tony: All right, we got a visual
100 yards ahead on the left.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.629
(Tires squeal)

22:11.631 --> 22:12.730
Got movement.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.701
That's close enough.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.002
(Muffled scream)
Richard: Megan?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.337
Drop the money.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.039
(Megan screams)

22:23.676 --> 22:25.343
Confirmed visual
on suspects.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.345
Armed, gray cargo Van,
lower level.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.680
(Megan sobbing)

22:31.117 --> 22:33.617
(Megan continues sobbing)

22:33.619 --> 22:34.919
Okay, you have
the money.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.921
Now, give me my daughter!

22:36.923 --> 22:38.122
(Sobs)

22:38.124 --> 22:39.790
Slight change of plans.

22:40.393 --> 22:41.359
Daddy!

22:41.361 --> 22:42.727
(Screams)

22:44.764 --> 22:46.530
(Tires squealing)
Go! Go!

22:47.767 --> 22:50.067
(Grunting)

22:50.069 --> 22:52.536
(Car alarms blaring)

22:52.538 --> 22:53.637
McGee:
Car exploded.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.139
Gibbs and fornell are down.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.779
(Car alarms blaring)

23:04.117 --> 23:05.583
(Alarms continue over speaker)

23:05.585 --> 23:06.917
Gibbs?

23:06.919 --> 23:08.152
McGee?

23:08.154 --> 23:09.620
Answer me.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.621
Gibbs?

23:10.623 --> 23:12.790
We need backup now.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.592
(Car alarms continue)

23:33.146 --> 23:35.079
Ducky...

23:35.581 --> 23:37.782
I told you, I'm fine.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.684
Thank you for your expert
medical opinion, Jethro,

23:40.686 --> 23:42.520
but I will be
the judge of that.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.489
I almost called your Dr. taft.

23:45.491 --> 23:49.160
That explosion could have given
you severe internal injuries.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.162
At least McGee and fornell
had the common sense

23:51.164 --> 23:52.763
to go to the hospital.
Yes,

23:52.765 --> 23:55.032
which is why I do not have
the time to sit around.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.600
Unless you are a surgeon,

23:56.602 --> 23:58.869
there's nothing you can do
about Mr. Porter.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.739
And if you keel over
you're not gonna be much help

24:01.741 --> 24:03.808
in finding Secnav's daughter.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.444
Now, sit down.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.587
I positively hate it
when you make me talk like that.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.055
You make me
sound like my mother.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.057
It's effective.
(Chuckles)

24:20.059 --> 24:23.627
I should've never
let 'em get away.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.730
Well, you have a bolo out.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.832
The airports
and train stations are on alert.

24:27.834 --> 24:28.999
You'll find them.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.801
They got their ransom.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.870
Why are they still
holding onto Megan?

24:32.872 --> 24:35.906
Well, perhaps it's not only
the money they're after.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.775
Hello, who are you?

24:37.777 --> 24:40.110
Special agent page.
Sorry to interrupt.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.912
Bishop said you were
looking for me.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.615
Thanks, duck.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.016
(Chuckles)

24:46.018 --> 24:47.084
(Elevator bell dings)

24:51.224 --> 24:52.957
(Elevator bell dings)

24:56.896 --> 24:58.696
I'd ask
if you were all right,

24:58.698 --> 25:00.865
but you don't seem like
the "lean on me" type.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.769
Or the verbal type.

25:05.771 --> 25:06.804
You got a pen?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.205
What?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.974
A pen.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.042
Uh, okay. Here.

25:32.832 --> 25:36.200
Can you do it or not?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.868
Yeah.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.937
(Elevator bell dings)
See what I can do.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.943
Okay, thanks.
Keep us posted.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.112
Richard Porter
is still in surgery.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.280
Bullet missed
his vest, but they

25:49.282 --> 25:50.915
managed to stop the bleeding.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.783
That's a bit
of good news, at least.
Yeah.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.618
(Elevator bell dings)
Well, here comes some more.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.587
McGee, agent fornell,

25:56.589 --> 25:57.688
glad you guys are back.
You know,

25:57.690 --> 25:59.757
I hate hospitals.
Can't shake the smell

25:59.758 --> 26:01.825
of antiseptic.
You know what I'm saying?
Will you stop complaining?

26:01.827 --> 26:02.860
You're not the one
who had to drop trou

26:02.862 --> 26:04.662
in front of nurse ratched.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.564
Mm.
Where's Gibbs?

26:06.566 --> 26:09.099
He's, um, upstairs,
MTAC, talking to Vance.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.139
What?

26:15.141 --> 26:17.675
No, just...
It's a nice look--

26:17.677 --> 26:19.109
the neon chin strap.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.911
Did you guys stop by a rave

26:20.913 --> 26:22.179
on the way back
from the hospital?

26:22.181 --> 26:23.781
Look, the er

26:23.783 --> 26:25.583
ran out of bandages, okay?
They had to borrow

26:25.585 --> 26:26.850
from pediatrics.
Kind of hard

26:26.852 --> 26:28.352
to take you guys seriously
with those on.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.721
Is it?

26:31.958 --> 26:34.158
As Tony was saying,
we were doing background

26:34.160 --> 26:36.327
on Richard Porter
and found something interesting

26:36.329 --> 26:38.829
about his company,
d-tav biofuel.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.865
Turns out they are in some
serious financial trouble.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.934
Millions of dollars
in debt, and it's only

26:43.936 --> 26:45.903
a matter of time
before they become insolvent.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.638
How deep a monetary hole
is Richard in?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.790
Tony: Zero.

26:49.791 --> 26:51.941
Porter is the ceo, but he has no
financial investment in d-tav,

26:51.944 --> 26:55.079
so if the company goes under,
all he loses is his job.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.981
Hardly motive
for a kidnapping.

26:56.983 --> 27:00.184
Not for Richard,
but it was for justine wolfe.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.353
His girlfriend?

27:02.355 --> 27:03.654
And business partner.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.923
D-tav was her vision.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.625
Over the last
few years, she sunk

27:07.627 --> 27:10.060
over five million dollars
into the company.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.328
If they went under,

27:11.330 --> 27:13.397
justine stood to lose
more than anyone.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.069
Very waspy.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.871
Kind of reminds me of home.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.973
Uh, a little showy
for my taste.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.409
I bet you grew up with dolls
that didn't even have faces.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.844
That's an amish thing.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.245
I know.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.314
Tony, look.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.025
(Coughs)

27:41.961 --> 27:43.227
It's empty.

27:43.229 --> 27:46.230
Let it air out.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.298
She must have left in a hurry.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.769
She didn't get very far.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.380
<i> (Elevator bell dings)</i>

28:03.382 --> 28:05.082
Gibbs. Okay,
I'm ready this time.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.984
So go ahead, ask me,
ask me, ask me.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.786
Got anything?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.721
You know better than to
ask me that, Gibbs.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.340
You know
i found something.

28:13.341 --> 28:15.958
So when the kidnappers
abandoned the Van at the mall,

28:15.961 --> 28:17.728
they didn't have time
to bleach-bomb it

28:17.730 --> 28:19.129
like they did the SUV,

28:19.131 --> 28:21.999
and I found this
on the floor.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.435
Megan Porter's class ring.
I ran an analysis on it

28:24.437 --> 28:26.003
and I found a DNA profile

28:26.005 --> 28:28.872
on one of
the Jewel's prongs.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.008
She scratched one
of her attackers, Gibbs.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.943
Clever girl.
Yup. So I ran that DNA

28:32.945 --> 28:34.445
through the system
and I got a hit.

28:35.414 --> 28:39.149
Owen Dixon, 38,
former overseas operative

28:39.151 --> 28:41.018
for wynnewood security services.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.020
Gibbs: Private military company
in dam neck.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.055
Yup, that's the one.
And guess who

28:45.057 --> 28:48.926
used to be a member of
wynnewood's board of directors?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.994
Justine wolfe.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.030
She knew a dozen operatives
that could have done

28:53.032 --> 28:54.164
her dirty work for her.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.100
Why Dixon?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.102
Because she knew that Dixon
had history with Secnav.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.137
Two years ago,
Dixon's unit

29:00.139 --> 29:03.140
conducted for-hire
black ops missions overseas.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.976
Secnav threatened
to pull wynnewood's contracts

29:05.978 --> 29:07.177
if they didn't take action.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.779
Five, including Dixon,

29:08.781 --> 29:11.081
were fired and four others
were charged

29:11.083 --> 29:13.250
and are currently
serving prison sentences.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.221
Justine wolfe's in it
for the money, not Dixon.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.457
That's why he's holding on
to Secnav's daughter.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.427
He wants revenge.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.311
Oh, my god.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.380
Yeah.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.419
I'll leave you for a moment.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.223
I don't understand
what's going on.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.491
Why would they target justine?

29:54.493 --> 29:55.959
She could've
ID'd them.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.028
She was involved
in my daughter's abduction?

29:58.030 --> 29:59.296
Justine orchestrated it.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.165
Her plan
was to use the ransom

30:01.167 --> 30:03.333
to bail d-tav out of debt.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.203
She reached out to a
former colleague to do the job.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.505
An Owen Dixon.
Once an operative for...

30:08.507 --> 30:10.974
Wynnewood security services.
Yes, I remember him.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.442
Justine knew
that Dixon blamed you

30:12.444 --> 30:14.044
for what happened
to his unit.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.946
She used him.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.514
Till Dixon double-crossed her.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.183
Well, if he wanted
some sort of payback,

30:19.185 --> 30:21.151
why not come after me?
Why my daughter?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.554
Operatives like Dixon,
they do their homework.

30:23.556 --> 30:25.823
Your security detail
posed a risk.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.958
He found a weakness to exploit.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.993
Megan.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.497
Those bullets were intended
for me, not Richard.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.566
(Phone rings)

30:37.903 --> 30:39.369
Fornell.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.606
Someone claiming to be
the kidnapper called into hq.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.007
Put him through.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.409
(Phone beeps)

30:45.411 --> 30:47.444
This is special agent fornell.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.580
Dixon:
My instructions were clear.

30:49.582 --> 30:51.298
I said no cops.

30:51.299 --> 30:53.015
Had you listened, that entire
mess could've been avoided.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.952
I'm listening now.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.353
I want a private jet,
fueled and ready,

30:56.355 --> 30:58.288
at loring regional airport,
tonight at 9:00 P.M.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.523
No trackers.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.958
What about Megan?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.460
She comes with us.

31:02.461 --> 31:03.961
The only assurance that
i have you won't intervene.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.896
But I'd be willing
to make a trade.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.031
Megan for her mother.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.601
How badly do you want to save
your daughter, madam secretary?

31:10.603 --> 31:12.469
(Line disconnects)

31:17.476 --> 31:20.043
Get him the plane.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.912
Do what he wants.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.415
(Door opens)

31:25.417 --> 31:27.217
Dixon has the advantage.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.553
Going to the airport
only makes him vulnerable.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.954
He's playing us.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.656
You know,
I've been in her position.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.025
When Emily was abducted,

31:35.027 --> 31:36.360
I was willing to do anything
to get her back.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.628
So will Secnav.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.062
I know that.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.530
That's what worries me.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.965
McGee:
<i> Dixon's four accomplices</i>

31:41.967 --> 31:44.001
are most likely the four
non-incarcerated members

31:44.003 --> 31:46.570
of his former
wynnewood security unit.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.238
Bishop:
According to the company's
files, they all received

31:48.240 --> 31:49.907
special operations training,

31:49.909 --> 31:52.075
worked mainly protection
and extraction details

31:52.077 --> 31:53.510
in hostile territories.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.579
They also had documented
behavioral issues,

31:55.581 --> 31:58.081
and if there's one thing you
want in your soldier of fortune,

31:58.083 --> 32:00.083
it's a impulse
control problem.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.686
Of more concern
is the arsenal of weapons

32:02.688 --> 32:04.554
they may have
at their disposal.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.557
During wynnewood's investigation
into Dixon's crew,

32:07.559 --> 32:11.028
their armory reported massive
inventory discrepancies.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.063
These are not the type
of men to go down quietly.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.632
(Phone rings, beeps)
Yeah, Abbs.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.101
Can you come to the lab?
I'm on my way down.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.369
(Phone beeps off)

32:19.371 --> 32:21.171
(Elevator bell dings)

32:21.173 --> 32:24.041
Abbs, everything all right?

32:24.043 --> 32:26.643
Ah, it is now.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.682
So, I have spent hours
combing through

32:31.684 --> 32:34.651
Dixon's cell phone calls
and bank statements,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.119
and I got nothing.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.388
Nah, he's too smart
to leave a paper trail.

32:38.390 --> 32:42.359
True, but a chain
is only as strong

32:42.361 --> 32:43.694
as its weakest link,

32:43.696 --> 32:45.963
and one of his links

32:45.965 --> 32:49.967
made five calls in the
last two days to...

32:49.969 --> 32:51.969
Edmund baylor.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.037
Who is he?

32:54.039 --> 32:56.106
He's a helicopter pilot
for a private company,

32:56.108 --> 32:59.476
who also received
a wire transfer for $50,000

32:59.478 --> 33:01.345
into his bank account
this morning.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.313
Where's baylor now?
According to the flight log,

33:03.315 --> 33:05.115
he's scheduled
to fly a private charter

33:05.117 --> 33:07.651
to Canada tonight, at 8:00 P.M.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.655
He's smuggling Dixon's crew
over the border.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.490
The plane was a decoy.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.992
What about Megan Porter?

33:14.994 --> 33:17.461
Mm-mm. She's too valuable
to leave behind.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.230
Abbs, get me the location
of the helo.

33:22.067 --> 33:24.067
Is agent fornell
meeting us at the location?

33:24.069 --> 33:26.770
No. FBI has to cover
the airfield

33:26.772 --> 33:28.405
in case we're wrong about Dixon.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.108
And if we're right,
we're to engage with a unit

33:31.110 --> 33:33.710
of heavily armed, special ops
trained soldiers on our own?

33:33.712 --> 33:35.479
(Elevator bell dings)
We appreciate the vote
of confidence, boss,

33:35.481 --> 33:37.481
but don't you think maybe
we should call for backup?

33:37.483 --> 33:40.183
(Elevator bell dings)
Already have. Yesterday.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.652
(Elevator bell dings)

33:42.654 --> 33:44.021
Man: It's all been checked
and cleared, ma'am.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.156
Ready to go.
Thank you.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.092
As promised, agent Gibbs.
(Elevator bell dings)

33:49.094 --> 33:50.293
You're our backup?

33:50.295 --> 33:51.561
And I brought my react team.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.529
How come you get
all the cool gear?

33:52.531 --> 33:53.764
One of the job perks.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.199
So what's the plan, boss?

33:57.302 --> 33:58.635
You heard the man.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.271
I'll run you through it.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.340
(Megan crying)

34:06.678 --> 34:08.378
(Muffled):
Where are you taking me?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.781
Gibbs:
NCIS!

34:10.783 --> 34:12.215
(Muffled scream)

34:14.653 --> 34:16.319
Gibbs:
Drop the weapons!

34:16.321 --> 34:17.587
You first, or the girl dies.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.427
Gibbs:
You're surrounded.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.831
It's over, Dixon.
Check your math.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.466
Did you really think
I'd leave us unguarded?

34:29.468 --> 34:31.268
My best sniper
is in that tree line.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.336
No doubt he's got you in his
crosshairs right about now.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.678
It's not good enough.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.154
(Gunshot)
(Grunts)

34:51.156 --> 34:52.355
(Megan whimpers)
Page (Over radio): Target down.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.390
(Megan crying)

34:53.392 --> 34:56.093
Don't move!

34:57.596 --> 34:59.396
Drop your weapons!

34:59.398 --> 35:01.231
Don't move!
Do it!

35:01.233 --> 35:03.233
Let me see your hands!

35:03.235 --> 35:05.135
Turn around, face the truck,

35:05.137 --> 35:06.236
hands behind your head.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.672
(Megan gasps)

35:08.674 --> 35:10.674
Megan, don't look
at him. Look at me.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.342
Look at me.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.112
(Crying)
It's all right.

35:15.114 --> 35:18.448
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.283
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.219
All right, you okay?
Yeah.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.154
We'll get you home.

35:24.156 --> 35:26.223
(Crying)

35:28.227 --> 35:30.127
Gibbs:
Yeah?

35:30.129 --> 35:32.329
(Seagull screeching,
metallic clang)

35:32.331 --> 35:34.331
(Elevator bell dings)

35:34.333 --> 35:37.167
(Indistinct chatter)

35:37.169 --> 35:39.302
Okay, page, so, what does
this course consist of?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.538
All right,
we'll cover three main areas.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.440
First is an advanced
weapons session.

35:43.442 --> 35:46.143
Next is tactical movements,
where we'll cover

35:46.145 --> 35:48.211
silent entries,
and then we'll move... I'm...

35:48.213 --> 35:49.813
I'm sorry. Why-why are you
staring at my teeth?

35:49.815 --> 35:52.282
Huh? No, I'm not.

35:53.418 --> 35:56.219
Okay, Tim, just please
tell him the story already.

35:56.221 --> 35:57.787
You haven't heard this story?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.723
What? Bishop knows?!
McGee: All right.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.725
Look, I'll tell you,
but you can't make fun of me.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.894
I promise.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.562
My word is my bond.
All right.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.865
Well, val and I were
each other's first kiss.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.434
What does that have to do
with the tooth?

36:12.371 --> 36:13.870
It was allergy season,

36:13.872 --> 36:15.505
and, uh,

36:15.507 --> 36:18.575
well, uh, leaned in for a kiss,
got a little itch.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.243
Turned to sneeze,

36:20.245 --> 36:22.245
and I head-butted her.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.613
Spent the next few hours
at the dentist.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.215
Talk about memorable.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.751
Well, Timothy farragut McGee,
you smooth operator.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.453
Tony.
Thank you for honoring me

36:30.455 --> 36:32.822
with... the tooth,

36:32.824 --> 36:34.958
the whole tooth
and nothing but the tooth.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.660
Page, do tell me,

36:36.662 --> 36:38.528
how long are you gonna be
in D.C.?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.830
Because I have
so many questions for you.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.400
Uh, actually,
i head out tonight.
Oh, so soon?

36:43.402 --> 36:45.769
Other field offices to visit,
and other agents to train.

36:45.771 --> 36:49.272
Besides, you all will be begging
me to leave by the day's end.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.675
Now, let's go.
Got a lot of work to do.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.248
Mm-hmm.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.383
Finish packing up
the communications gear.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.685
Mm-hmm, yes, sir.

37:01.687 --> 37:05.222
Right. Right, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.990
Going someplace?

37:06.992 --> 37:09.292
Yeah, Richard Porter
regained consciousness.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.860
Secnav and Megan
are getting ready,

37:10.862 --> 37:12.329
and we're leaving
for the hospital in ten.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.431
Go home. I'll take
care of things.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.400
Actually,

37:17.402 --> 37:18.535
I was thinking
about driving up

37:18.537 --> 37:20.804
and surprising Emily
at school.
Nice.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.323
Give her my best.
I owe you one.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.841
No you don't.
Yeah. I'll bring you back a
bottle of that pure maple syrup.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.686
Do you have an internal
alarm that goes off

37:36.688 --> 37:38.555
every time
a fresh pot is brewed?

37:38.557 --> 37:40.557
How's Megan holding up?

37:40.559 --> 37:43.260
Better than me.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.763
I spent all night staring
at her while she slept.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.599
I was afraid
if I went to asleep,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.269
she'd be gone when I woke up.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.804
She's safe. It's over.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.573
Is it?

37:56.575 --> 37:58.975
When I took this job,

37:58.977 --> 38:01.278
I knew that I'd have to
make certain sacrifices,

38:01.280 --> 38:03.346
but my daughter's safety
can't be one of them.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.632
What does that mean?

38:05.633 --> 38:07.917
Well, maybe it's time i
reevaluate my priorities.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.786
You're gonna quit?

38:11.757 --> 38:14.391
If it's best
for my family.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.428
You don't agree?

38:18.430 --> 38:19.596
Think I'm letting them win?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.798
Being ruled by fear? What?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.000
I don't think
it matters what I think.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.468
Humor me.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.608
Family is important.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.744
That's it?

38:34.746 --> 38:36.746
No rousing pep talk?

38:36.748 --> 38:39.716
No "we need you on that wall,
madam secretary?"

38:39.718 --> 38:40.817
Disappointed?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.385
A little bit, yeah.

38:42.387 --> 38:45.322
Think you just answered
your own question.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.457
(Laughs)

38:47.459 --> 38:49.859
You're good.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.998
Agent Gibbs,
i have to thank you.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
For everything.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.802
Any time, madam secretary.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.437
Any time.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.706
Hey. I'm ready.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.075
(Makes kissing sound)

39:05.077 --> 39:07.711
You sure you're ready
to do this? Gonna be okay?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.379
Yes. I want to be there, mom.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.914
Daddy needs us.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.082
Car's outside.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.050
Okay, let's go.
Oh.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.052
Almost forgot something.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.722
Figured you might
want this back?

39:18.724 --> 39:21.524
That was smart,
getting his DNA.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.992
I knew you'd find it.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.028
Hmm. How?

39:25.030 --> 39:27.564
My mom's talked about you.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.965
And all this time,

39:28.967 --> 39:31.067
I thought you
weren't listening.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.070
Okay, let's go.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.140
