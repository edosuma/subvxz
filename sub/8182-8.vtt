01:06.432 --> 01:08.366
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

01:09.368 --> 01:10.768
OH, MY GOD.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.973

IN FRONT OF ME.

01:15.041 --> 01:19.493
OH, MY GOD.
COME ON. COME ON.

01:19.562 --> 01:21.930
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.317
OH. HE'S... HE'S OK.

01:25.384 --> 01:27.735
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHO HE BELONGS TO?

01:44.152 --> 01:45.670
HOLD IT.

01:45.737 --> 01:48.506
OH. MR. KAUFMAN.

01:48.573 --> 01:50.008
CARRIE.

01:52.077 --> 01:54.195
I GUESS I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE LATE TODAY, HUH?

01:54.263 --> 01:56.531
I GOT HERE AT 6 A.M.

01:56.598 --> 01:58.166
MMM.

01:58.234 --> 02:00.318
WHAT YOU GOT
THERE, A BOOK?

02:00.386 --> 02:01.702
OH. "THE CONTORTIONIST'S
DAUGHTER."

02:01.771 --> 02:03.537
IT FOLLOWS
A BEDRIDDEN PROFESSOR

02:03.605 --> 02:05.539
AND HIS GROWING
DISILLUSIONMENT

02:05.607 --> 02:08.542
IN 17th-CENTURY
PRUSSIA.

02:08.610 --> 02:11.044
OOH. THAT SOUNDS
FASCINATING.

02:11.113 --> 02:13.948
WELL... THEN HERE.

02:14.016 --> 02:14.732
WHAT?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.051
I JUST FINISHED IT
THIS MORNING.

02:16.086 --> 02:17.469
YOU CAN HAVE
MY COPY.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.054
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:19.121 --> 02:20.555
OH, PLEASE. I'D LOVE
TO HAVE SOMEONE

02:20.623 --> 02:22.057
TO DISCUSS IT WITH.

02:22.124 --> 02:23.558
MY WIFE THINKS
1,100 PAGES

02:23.626 --> 02:25.860
IS TOO LONG
FOR A BOOK.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.546
SOMETIMES I FORGET
SHE'S ONLY 29.

02:28.613 --> 02:31.566
WELL... ENJOY.

02:31.634 --> 02:33.934
WILL DO.

02:34.002 --> 02:35.053
CRAP.

02:39.124 --> 02:41.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T TAKE CHICKENS?

02:42.027 --> 02:43.078
YOU'RE ANIMAL CONTROL.

02:43.145 --> 02:45.080
I BETCHA IF I HAD
A DOG OR A CAT,

02:45.147 --> 02:47.082
YOU'D BE ROLLING OUT
THE RED CARPET.

02:47.149 --> 02:49.550
HELLO? HELLO?

02:51.771 --> 02:57.726
SO, UH... SHOULD I
DROP YOU OFF HERE OR...

03:00.746 --> 03:03.932
"AS YERGEN APPLIED AN OINTMENT
TO HIS WITHERED LEG,

03:03.999 --> 03:07.768
"HE THOUGHT BACK TO HIS DAYS
AS AN APPRENTICE BAKER.

03:07.837 --> 03:12.106
THE FIRST BREAD YERGEN MADE
WAS A PUMPERNICKEL."

03:15.344 --> 03:17.445
HOW LONG IS THIS RECIPE?

03:19.281 --> 03:22.116
HEY. I'M HOME.

03:22.184 --> 03:23.451
HEY.

03:24.854 --> 03:26.955
WHERE YOU BEEN? I HAD
DINNER READY FOR 2 HOURS.

03:27.022 --> 03:28.423
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE MY DAY.

03:28.490 --> 03:30.725
I HAD TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY
UP TO PLATTSBURG.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.059
WHAT?

03:32.111 --> 03:33.778
CRAZY STORY. I'M DELIVERING
IN CHINATOWN, RIGHT?

03:33.845 --> 03:35.280
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN-

03:35.347 --> 03:37.949
AH, GOOD. IT'S STILL
NICE AND JUICY.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.127
STOP IT!

04:23.195 --> 04:25.346
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

04:25.414 --> 04:26.831
I GOTTA GET SOME AIR.

04:31.519 --> 04:33.187
OH, MY GOD.

04:33.255 --> 04:35.923
HEY, DOUG.

04:35.991 --> 04:38.042
HEY, GLENN.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.194
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:40.262 --> 04:43.264
NOTHING.
IT'S STUPID.

04:43.331 --> 04:44.699
PROBLEMS
AREN'T STUPID.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.301
PEOPLE WHO
IGNORE THEM ARE.

04:48.587 --> 04:51.856
IT'S JUST... TODAY I HELPED
THIS INJURED CHICKEN,

04:51.923 --> 04:54.692
AND I SORT OF GOT
ATTACHED TO HIM,

04:54.760 --> 04:56.527
AND THEN WHEN
I CAME HOME,

04:56.595 --> 04:59.063
CARRIE HAD DINNER
WAITING FOR ME.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.833
LET ME GUESS.
CHICKEN?

05:01.901 --> 05:03.884
YEAH. I TOLD YOU
IT WAS STUPID.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.220
NO, DOUG, IT ISN'T.

05:06.288 --> 05:07.539
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

05:07.606 --> 05:09.541
WHAT GOES ON
AT A POULTRY MILL?

05:09.608 --> 05:11.909
IT'S BARBARIC.

05:11.977 --> 05:13.210
I GUESS I'M PRETTY MUCH
DONE EATING CHICKEN.

05:13.278 --> 05:14.712
I'LL TELL YOU
THAT MUCH.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.714
HEY, THANK GOD I DIDN'T
MAKE FRIENDS WITH A COW.

05:16.782 --> 05:19.216
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:19.284 --> 05:20.735
AFTER THEY'RE STUNNED,

05:20.803 --> 05:23.021
THE CATTLE ENTER
THE DEATH CHUTE

05:23.089 --> 05:25.740
WHERE THEY ARE KILLED,
DISMEMBERED,

05:25.808 --> 05:28.977
AND PREPARED
FOR PROCESSING.

05:29.044 --> 05:29.828
IS IT ALMOST OVER?

05:29.928 --> 05:32.463
NOT UNTIL YOU LEARN
HOW HOT DOGS ARE MADE.

05:34.433 --> 05:38.135
IT'S OK, DOUG.
IT'S OK, DOUG.

05:43.659 --> 05:45.560
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:45.627 --> 05:46.760
GLENN JUST SHOWED ME
SOME MOVIE

05:46.828 --> 05:48.262
ABOUT HOW MEAT
IS MADE,

05:48.330 --> 05:50.198
AND NOW
I CAN'T EAT IT.

05:50.265 --> 05:51.516
COME ON.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.951
CARRIE, I'M SERIOUS.

05:53.018 --> 05:54.251
I WAS JUST DOWN
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

05:54.319 --> 05:56.220
YOU KNOW WHAT I ATE?
AN APPLE!

05:56.288 --> 05:58.339
OH, MY GOD.

05:58.407 --> 06:02.527
AND A YODEL,
BUT STILL, I JUST...

06:02.595 --> 06:03.761
DOUG, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:03.829 --> 06:05.763
YOU EAT FAST FOOD
2 OR 3 TIMES A WEEK.

06:05.831 --> 06:08.933
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT ANIMALS WERE INVOLVED?

06:09.001 --> 06:10.601
BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE
IT LOOK LIKE AN ANIMAL.

06:10.669 --> 06:13.371
THEY'RE VERY CLEVER
THAT WAY.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.608
WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:16.675 --> 06:17.942
JUST TALK ABOUT MEAT
AND DO STUFF TO ME, OK?

06:18.010 --> 06:19.811
I GOT TO LINK IT
TO SOMETHING GOOD AGAIN.

06:19.878 --> 06:22.781
NO. OK, AS FLATTERING
AS THAT IS,

06:22.848 --> 06:24.448
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.550
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
STOP EATING MEAT?

06:26.618 --> 06:28.586
I MEAN, YOU HAD
AN APPLE, RIGHT?

06:28.654 --> 06:30.137
OH, COME ON. NO.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.473
MY BODY TRIED
TO REJECT IT.

06:32.541 --> 06:35.142
THANK GOD THE YODEL
KEPT IT DOWN.

06:37.012 --> 06:39.647
DOUG, MAYBE THIS WHOLE
THING IS FATE, YOU KNOW,

06:39.715 --> 06:42.483
A CHANCE FOR YOU
TO START EATING BETTER.

06:42.551 --> 06:44.819
YOU KNOW, STICK AROUND
A LITTLE LONGER...

06:44.887 --> 06:47.722
AND BURP LESS.

06:47.789 --> 06:49.990
I GUESS I COULD TRY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

06:50.058 --> 06:51.992
I'VE EATEN MEAT
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

06:52.060 --> 06:55.362
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
COMING OUT WITH ANYTHING NEW.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.418
COME ON. WE'VE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.154
ANY NEW BURGER IDEAS AT ALL?

07:03.222 --> 07:04.455
OK.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.340
HOW ABOUT WE REVISIT
THE MIAMI STACKER?

07:06.408 --> 07:08.526
WE'VE BEEN OVER THAT
A DOZEN TIMES.

07:08.593 --> 07:10.328
NO BUN IN THE WORLD
COULD SUPPORT 5 PATTIES.

07:10.395 --> 07:12.630
IT'S JUST PHYSICS.

07:12.698 --> 07:13.548
YEAH. YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.850
NOBODY WANTS A BURGER
THAT KEEPS FALLING DOWN.

07:17.769 --> 07:20.004
PEN. PEN.

07:27.496 --> 07:31.049
"THE LEANING TOWER
OF PIZZA BURGER."

07:31.116 --> 07:34.886
THE BOTTOM BUN
IS A MINI PIZZA.

07:41.860 --> 07:45.045
I GUESS THE OLD DOG STILL
HAS ONE MORE TRICK IN HIM.

07:45.113 --> 07:46.214
GOD, I LOVE YOU.

07:46.281 --> 07:47.781
WHAT?
NOTHING.

07:47.849 --> 07:49.333
GREAT IDEA,
BOSS.

07:53.788 --> 07:55.222
WELL, LOOK AT YOU,

07:55.290 --> 07:56.890
ENJOYING
YOUR TOFU SAUSAGE

07:56.959 --> 07:59.393
AND "I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE NOT EGGS."

07:59.461 --> 08:00.828
YEP.

08:00.895 --> 08:02.396
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
THEM TASTE BETTER?

08:02.464 --> 08:04.198
KNOWING I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING...

08:04.266 --> 08:09.170
AND A BUTTLOAD
OF HOT SAUCE.

08:09.237 --> 08:11.472
I AM REALLY PROUD
OF YOU, HONEY.

08:11.539 --> 08:14.391
AH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
REALLY.

08:19.381 --> 08:21.715
WHEN DID YOU
GET GLASSES?

08:21.783 --> 08:24.285
THE DOCTOR SAID I PROBABLY
NEEDED THEM FOR YEARS,

08:24.352 --> 08:25.787
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT
UNTIL I STARTED READING

08:25.854 --> 08:27.955
ALL THE STUFF
THAT GLENN GAVE ME.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.909
RUSSIAN RIVER, 5 LETTERS.

08:34.979 --> 08:37.715
VOLGA.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.154
WHAT?

08:44.222 --> 08:45.939
IT'S NOTHING.

08:46.007 --> 08:47.691
NO, COME ON.
WHAT? TELL ME.

08:47.759 --> 08:48.943
IT'S JUST...

08:49.011 --> 08:51.679
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE DRINKING COFFEE.

08:51.746 --> 08:54.415
WHY? IS THERE
MEAT IN IT?

08:56.751 --> 08:58.786
NO, BUT THE PEOPLE
WHO PICK THE BEANS

08:58.854 --> 09:02.023
WORK UNDER
VERY TERRIBLE CONDITIONS.

09:02.090 --> 09:04.959
JUAN VALDEZ, THAT NICE
GUY WITH THE DONKEY...

09:05.027 --> 09:08.429
HE'S AN ACTOR, CARRIE.
I KNOW THAT NOW.

09:25.948 --> 09:28.449
WOW. PAGE 480.

09:28.516 --> 09:30.017
YOU'RE ALMOST
HALFWAY THROUGH.

09:30.085 --> 09:32.637
OH. I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO PUT IT DOWN.

09:32.704 --> 09:35.139
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD
MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE.

09:35.206 --> 09:36.974
HAVE THEY?

09:37.041 --> 09:38.976
OH, NO. IT'S
CONSIDERED UNFILMABLE.

09:39.044 --> 09:41.646
LISTEN, WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE SHINDIG ON SATURDAY

09:41.713 --> 09:44.315
TO CELEBRATE THE OPENING
OF SEVEN WATER PLAZA.

09:44.382 --> 09:46.818
I'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO COME.

09:46.885 --> 09:49.487
REALLY? I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST FOR THE PARTNERS

09:49.555 --> 09:51.689
AND, YOU KNOW, BIG SHOTS.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.009
IT IS. HA HA HA.

09:55.077 --> 09:57.078
GOT TO HAVE
MY BOOK BUDDY THERE.

09:57.145 --> 09:59.580
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.186
DUGAN GROUP.

10:05.253 --> 10:06.353
HEY, BABE.

10:06.421 --> 10:07.521
HEY, HONEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:07.589 --> 10:08.856
UH, NOTHING.
JUST TELLING YOU

10:08.924 --> 10:10.324
NOT TO FILL UP
ON ANYTHING

10:10.391 --> 10:14.194
BECAUSE FOR DINNER,
I'M MAKING BEAN STEAKS.

10:16.498 --> 10:19.367
AGAIN? HA HA HA.

10:19.434 --> 10:21.369
YUMMY!

10:21.436 --> 10:23.871
OH, ACTUALLY,
I JUST REMEMBERED.

10:23.939 --> 10:26.573
I HAVE TO WORK
LATE TONIGHT.

10:26.641 --> 10:28.509
YEAH.
REALLY?

10:28.576 --> 10:30.210
OH, ALL RIGHT. WELL,
IF YOU GET HUNGRY,

10:30.278 --> 10:31.712
JUST LOOK
IN YOUR PURSE.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.314
I PUT IN
SOME SNAP PEAS.

10:33.381 --> 10:35.616
YEAH.

10:35.683 --> 10:36.717
YEAH, I SAW THAT.

10:36.785 --> 10:38.286
BUT NEXT TIME,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO

10:38.353 --> 10:40.721
PUT THEM
IN A LITTLE BAGGIE.

10:40.789 --> 10:42.223
NOT BIODEGRADABLE.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.225
OK. I GOT TO GO, BABE.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.533
HI, CARRIE.

10:53.601 --> 10:55.720
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:55.787 --> 10:56.888
PLEASE DON'T TELL DOUG.

10:56.955 --> 11:00.892
I JUST NEEDED TO EAT
SOMETHING WITH A FACE.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.993
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HIM, ANYWAY?

11:03.061 --> 11:04.729
HE JUST FOUND SOMETHING
THAT HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.698
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT IT'S A LITTLE ANNOYING.

11:07.766 --> 11:09.082
A LITTLE ANNOYING?
CAN YOU TELL HIM

11:09.150 --> 11:10.918
TO STOP THROWING
PAINT ON MY PANTS?

11:10.985 --> 11:13.153
HE THINKS CORDUROY
IS AN ANIMAL.

11:13.221 --> 11:14.238
HEY.

11:14.305 --> 11:15.539
HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

11:15.607 --> 11:16.923
HOW'S THE NEW JOB?

11:16.991 --> 11:18.075
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING, MAN?

11:18.142 --> 11:20.077
I STAND ON THE SIDEWALK
ALL DAY HOLDING THIS.

11:20.144 --> 11:21.913
YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST
NO ONE'S PEEING ON YOU,

11:21.980 --> 11:24.415
LIKE WHEN YOU WORKED
IN THE SUBWAY.

11:24.482 --> 11:26.433
HA. GUESS AGAIN.

11:26.502 --> 11:27.668
UH...

11:27.736 --> 11:30.705
OH. "THE CONTORTIONIST'S
DAUGHTER."

11:30.772 --> 11:32.757
I HEARD A REALLY GOOD
REVIEW OF THIS

11:32.825 --> 11:35.392
ON NPR's "BOOK NOOK"
THE OTHER DAY.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.794
REALLY?
YEAH.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.946
HEY, UM... ANY CHANCE
YOU WANT TO READ IT

11:39.013 --> 11:41.181
AND WRITE A LITTLE
SUMMARY FOR ME?

11:41.249 --> 11:42.767
PLEASE. IT WOULD
HELP ME OUT SO MUCH.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.435
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I DON'T
HAVE THE TIME.

11:44.502 --> 11:46.537
I HAVE TO BE OUT
WITH MY SIGN ALL WEEK.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.826
FREE PHONE. FREE PHONE.
FREE... PHONE.

12:00.852 --> 12:03.120
CLASSIC YERGEN.

12:05.824 --> 12:07.308
OH, HEY, BABE.

12:07.376 --> 12:08.543
HEY.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.478
OH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY,

12:10.546 --> 12:12.313
I MADE RESERVATIONS
AT THE SPROUTBACK.

12:12.381 --> 12:14.482
IS THAT OK?

12:14.550 --> 12:17.784
SPENCE FINISHED
THE BOOK ALREADY?

12:17.852 --> 12:21.121
NO. HE SAID HE COULDN'T
GET PAST PAGE 5.

12:21.189 --> 12:24.124
NOW I'M GLAD
I GOT HIM FIRED.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.827
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS PROBLEM IS.

12:26.895 --> 12:29.563
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING.

12:29.630 --> 12:30.831
YOU'RE READING IT?

12:30.899 --> 12:32.666
YEAH. FIRST
HUNDRED PAGES

12:32.734 --> 12:34.402
STARTS OUT
A LITTLE ROUGH,

12:34.469 --> 12:36.153
BUT ONCE YOU REALIZE
IT'S MEANT TO BE

12:36.221 --> 12:38.155
ALLEGORICAL, IT'S
A REAL PAGE-TURNER.

12:40.258 --> 12:42.009
HEY, HONEY, ANY CHANCE
YOU CAN FINISH THIS BOOK

12:42.077 --> 12:45.379
BY KAUFMAN'S PARTY
ON SATURDAY AND FILL ME IN?

12:45.447 --> 12:46.247
YEAH, I GUESS.

12:46.315 --> 12:48.115
OH, SPEAKING
OF THE PARTY,

12:48.182 --> 12:49.350
I GOT YOU SOMETHING TO WEAR.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.517
OH, REALLY?

12:50.585 --> 12:51.685
YEAH.

12:53.421 --> 12:55.356
CHECK IT OUT.

13:01.195 --> 13:02.863
READ THE LABEL.

13:02.931 --> 13:07.000
IT'S 100% PURE
UNPROCESSED HEMP.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.106
IT'S FROM THE WOODY
HARRELSON COLLECTION.

13:12.173 --> 13:14.041
HONEY, I APPRECIATE ALL THIS.
I REALLY DO.

13:14.109 --> 13:16.577
BUT I THINK YOU'RE THROWING
A LOT AT ME AT ONCE.

13:16.645 --> 13:18.212
I MEAN, I'M JUST
GETTING USED

13:18.280 --> 13:20.948
TO THE "ONE FLUSH A DAY"
RULE, SO...

13:21.015 --> 13:25.119
BUT YOU ARE... YOU'RE
GONNA WEAR IT, RIGHT?

13:26.271 --> 13:27.338
YES.

13:27.406 --> 13:28.889
YOU KEEP READING
THAT BOOK, BABY,

13:28.957 --> 13:30.390
AND I'M GOING TO
TRY IT ON

13:30.459 --> 13:31.725
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:31.793 --> 13:33.060
ALL RIGHT.
OK.

13:33.127 --> 13:35.162
THAT'S MY GIRL.
YEAH.

13:35.229 --> 13:37.898
"SIZE- HUMAN."

13:55.250 --> 13:56.467
YOU'RE ALWAYS WORRIED

13:56.535 --> 13:58.636
ABOUT SOMEONE WEARING
THE SAME DRESS.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.971
NOT TONIGHT.

14:01.039 --> 14:02.489
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
FORGET ABOUT THE DRESS.

14:02.557 --> 14:03.991
I WANT TO GO OVER

14:04.059 --> 14:05.826
THE NOTES YOU GAVE ME
FOR KAUFMAN, OK?

14:05.893 --> 14:07.661
THEMES, SYMBOLISM,
BREAD AS A MOTIF.

14:07.728 --> 14:10.164
IS THAT HOW
YOU SPELL "MOTIF"?

14:10.231 --> 14:13.167
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:13.234 --> 14:14.851
CARRIE. DOUG.

14:14.919 --> 14:16.370
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

14:16.437 --> 14:18.271
YOU REMEMBER
MY WIFE AMY.

14:18.339 --> 14:19.006
HEY.

14:19.073 --> 14:20.941
YES. OF COURSE.

14:21.009 --> 14:24.061
SHE WAS OUR INTERN
LAST SUMMER.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.345
BACON-WRAPPED SCALLOP?

14:25.413 --> 14:26.680
AMY MADE THEM.

14:26.748 --> 14:29.349
SHE'S TAKING CLASSES DOWN
AT THE CULINARY INSTITUTE.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.167
HAVE ONE.

14:30.235 --> 14:32.720
NO. THAT'S OK.
THANK YOU.

14:32.787 --> 14:34.555
YOU'RE NOT
HUNGRY, DOUG?

14:34.622 --> 14:37.191
ACTUALLY, I'M VERY HUNGRY.
IT'S JUST, UH...

14:37.258 --> 14:39.726
MMM... I'M A VEGETARIAN.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.463
HONEY, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE ITTY-BITTY THING.

14:43.532 --> 14:45.866
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST HAVE ONE?

14:45.934 --> 14:48.869
I'M AFRAID I DON'T
EAT ANIMALS...

14:48.937 --> 14:52.123
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE
WRAPPED IN OTHER ANIMALS.

14:52.190 --> 14:53.541
WELL, I THINK
THERE'S SOME MELON.

14:53.608 --> 14:55.208
I'LL PICK OFF
THE PROSCIUTTO.

14:55.276 --> 14:57.962
NO, NO. HE'S OK. YEAH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

14:58.029 --> 15:00.430
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL GO
EMPTY OUT SOME MUSHROOM CAPS.

15:00.498 --> 15:01.882
JUST MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO REMNANTS.

15:01.949 --> 15:03.617
OK? NO REMNANTS.

15:03.684 --> 15:05.819
SO, CARRIE,
HAVE YOU FINISHED

15:05.887 --> 15:08.655
"THE CONTORTIONIST'S
DAUGHTER" YET?

15:08.723 --> 15:11.926
FINISHED IT?
DEVOURED IT. HA!

15:11.993 --> 15:13.644
AND?

15:13.711 --> 15:15.228
LOVED IT!

15:15.296 --> 15:17.381
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

15:17.449 --> 15:20.568
YEAH. YOU KNOW
WHAT I REALIZED?

15:20.635 --> 15:22.569
YERGEN WAS NEVER AS FREE

15:22.637 --> 15:25.805
AS WHEN HE WAS
CONFINED TO THAT BED.

15:25.873 --> 15:28.576
YES! AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS OBSESSION

15:28.643 --> 15:32.079
WITH THE UMBRELLA?
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

15:32.146 --> 15:33.914
OH. OH, YEAH.
THE UMBRELLA...

15:33.981 --> 15:36.417
UM... WAS HIS NEED
FOR SHELTER...

15:36.484 --> 15:39.819
IN A...
IN AN UNFRIENDLY WORLD.

15:39.887 --> 15:41.738
HOW ASTUTE.
WELL, I'M GLAD

15:41.807 --> 15:45.009
YOU ENJOYED IT
AS MUCH AS I DID.

15:45.076 --> 15:46.344
OH, YES, I DID.

15:46.411 --> 15:47.911
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.413
THERE'S NOTHING
I ENJOY MORE

15:49.481 --> 15:51.648
THAN CURLING UP
WITH A GOOD BOOK

15:51.716 --> 15:53.250
AND A NICE CUP
OF COFFEE.

15:53.318 --> 15:54.584
MM-HMM.

15:56.888 --> 16:00.257
DOUG, I WAS REALLY SCORING SOME
BIG POINTS ON THAT STUPID BOOK.

16:00.325 --> 16:02.760
AND THEN YOU HAD TO GO ON
RANTING TO MR. KAUFMAN

16:02.828 --> 16:06.697
ABOUT JUAN VALDEZ
AND HIS DONKEY.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.516
I WASN'T RANTING.
I WAS EDUCATING.

16:10.818 --> 16:12.435
SWEET. MY SEEDS
ARE HERE.

16:12.503 --> 16:14.989
HELLO,
FRESH RADISHES.

16:15.056 --> 16:16.456
ENOUGH ALREADY.

16:16.524 --> 16:17.958
WHAT IS
YOUR PROBLEM?

16:18.026 --> 16:19.443
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?

16:19.511 --> 16:21.945
OK. WELL, EVER SINCE
YOU STOPPED EATING MEAT

16:22.013 --> 16:25.382
AND STARTED READING, YOU'VE
BEEN ACTING LIKE AN ASS.

16:25.450 --> 16:28.335
OK? HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO KEEP THIS UP?

16:28.402 --> 16:31.138
OK. FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T LIKE THE LANGUAGE.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.625
SECOND OF ALL,
THIS IS FOREVER.

16:35.693 --> 16:37.661
THIS IS FOR LIFE.

16:37.729 --> 16:40.647
OH, MY GOD.
WOULD YOU STOP IT ALREADY?

16:40.715 --> 16:41.815
STOP WHAT?

16:41.883 --> 16:43.634
THAT WHOLE THING
WHERE YOU SAY SOMETHING

16:43.702 --> 16:45.369
AND THEN PAUSE
FOR EMPHASIS

16:45.437 --> 16:47.304
AND THEN SAY
THE SAME EXACT THING

16:47.372 --> 16:50.507
ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.
IT'S SO SICKENING, MAN.

16:52.227 --> 16:53.643
I GET IT.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.413
YOU'RE... YOU'RE
THREATENED BY ME.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.647
WHAT?

16:57.716 --> 16:59.016
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:59.084 --> 17:03.087
BECAUSE...
I AM EVOLVING,

17:03.154 --> 17:04.503
AND YOU-

17:10.395 --> 17:13.329
YOU...

17:13.397 --> 17:18.117
ARE REMAINING STAGNANT
IN YOUR IGNORANT WAYS.

17:18.185 --> 17:20.020
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY-I HAD ENOUGH.

17:20.088 --> 17:21.689
THAT'S IT. OK?

17:21.756 --> 17:24.023
I HAD ENOUGH
OF THE COMPOST HEAPS

17:24.092 --> 17:26.358
AND THE STRAW MATTRESS.

17:26.426 --> 17:28.178
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, BUDDY.

17:28.246 --> 17:30.614
YOUR READING DAYS
ARE OVER. YEAH.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.682
HEY. HEY!

17:34.152 --> 17:36.703
THROW IT OUT! THROW OUT
ALL THE BOOKS YOU WANT!

17:36.771 --> 17:41.041
THE NEW DOUG HEFFERNAN'S HERE,
AND HE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE!

17:44.429 --> 17:46.947
SO THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY CLEAR,

17:47.015 --> 17:48.532
IF YOU JUST...
IF YOU JUST LOOK

17:48.600 --> 17:49.866
AT THE COMPARISON
BETWEEN-

17:49.934 --> 17:51.134
YES? WHAT IS IT?

17:51.202 --> 17:52.870
THIS IS FROM MY MOLE
AT ULTRA BURGER.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.371

A WHOLE NEW BURGER.

17:54.438 --> 17:56.006

17:56.074 --> 17:59.726
THE BOTTOM BUN

17:59.794 --> 18:03.147
OH, MY GOD.

18:03.214 --> 18:04.798
OK. LISTEN UP.

18:04.865 --> 18:06.650

18:39.667 --> 18:43.921
IT AIN'T ABOUT LAYERS.
IT'S ABOUT FLAVOR.
