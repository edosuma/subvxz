WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.216
This is my favorite tequila too.

00:08.299 --> 00:09.676
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.759 --> 00:11.344
Maybe it's an inherited taste?

00:15.640 --> 00:19.269
So that's why you guys came to Mexico.
To blackmail me.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.605
No, Mom has no idea I know.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.066
Right, you think I'm stupid?

00:25.150 --> 00:28.737
She told me that my dad was some guy
she had sex with in a bar.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.240
She protected you for 25 years.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.704
Written confessions are so risky, Simón.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.502
A letter doesn't prove I'm your father.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.547
Mom wouldn't go to Monterrey
to live so wretchedly,

00:47.630 --> 00:50.383
roam the world
and end up in the Canary Islands

00:50.467 --> 00:53.094
if she didn't have
her brother-in-law's kid.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.388
I bet we have the same birthmark.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.517
We can have a DNA test if you're not sure.

01:01.853 --> 01:06.191
Although someone else could find out.
Consider yourself lucky.

01:09.069 --> 01:09.944
Lucky?

01:11.946 --> 01:15.700
That your newfound daughter
never wants to see you again.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.705
Maybe if I were a little more bitchy

01:22.040 --> 01:23.708
it could be a different story.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.298
If you'll excuse me.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.728
Why didn't you tell me you saw my sister?

01:44.646 --> 01:47.440
Don't deny it. She told me herself.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.985
-She regrets we split up.
-But it's been two months.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.824
She needs to understand
you can't get back together.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.410
-Simón. Are you listening to me?
-What's your problem?

01:59.911 --> 02:03.331
I'm sick and tired
of these secret meetings!

02:03.414 --> 02:04.666
Especially now that…

02:06.376 --> 02:07.544
Why didn't you tell me?

02:10.088 --> 02:11.381
I didn't even tell him.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.386
I decided it was best to leave
and start all over again.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.598
The job in Monterrey was true.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.725
But who is the dad?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.062
Don't you know his name?

02:28.064 --> 02:29.440
Just do it.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.026
It's not that easy, Susana.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.281
I knocked up your sister.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.952
You should've told me, Susi.
I'm your sister.

02:41.035 --> 02:44.038
I would've understood and helped you.
Oh, Susi!

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
What did I miss?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.167
Another drink?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.794
-Yes, I'll have another.
-Good.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.106
You should've told us earlier, Matilde.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.860
I didn't want you to know
your sister is a criminal.

03:13.943 --> 03:18.156
-It was in self-defense.
-Yes, the bastard deserved to die.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.409
They can't find you. I'll ask Lorenzo…

03:21.492 --> 03:22.327
No.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.707
I'll change my name
and get my Mexican papers.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.293
It's just that

03:31.502 --> 03:33.338
Pocho asked me to marry him.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.758
No!

03:37.717 --> 03:39.302
You don't know him.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.304
Look who's talking.

03:41.387 --> 03:45.058
You don't know him.
Pocho is a great guy, Bautista.

03:54.984 --> 03:59.364
-Man! How did you get this palace?
-Good afternoon.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.574
Hey!

04:03.409 --> 04:05.245
What, asshole, what?

04:13.086 --> 04:16.839
I can't pay any more now.
I put all my savings in my salon.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.675
Shall we?

05:17.066 --> 05:18.192
Tell me something.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.778
Do you like spaghetti bolognese?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.655
Yes.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.533
Great, it's all I can cook.

05:26.034 --> 05:26.868
What?

05:26.951 --> 05:29.078
Did you think I'd just walk in,

05:29.162 --> 05:32.707
take your clothes off
and make love to you on the wall?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.462
Well…

05:39.297 --> 05:43.176
I admit that was my plan B
if you were vegetarian.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.762
Want some wine?

05:47.722 --> 05:48.806
It's top quality.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.814
Thanks.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.196
You need to be on social media.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.366
Especially if it's a new business.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.451
Mexico City is so big,

06:08.534 --> 06:11.621
that people won't find you
if you're not on social media.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.334
The problem is
not only clients would find me, Tomás.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.422
You don't need to say
who the guy in Cancún is,

06:23.007 --> 06:26.594
but if he hurt you
I'll beat the crap out of him.

06:31.766 --> 06:35.186
He's the assistant of a guy
I worked for ages ago.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.022
Doing what?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.317
Doing astrology charts.

06:43.486 --> 06:47.657
I told him the best dates
to make shipments to the USA.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.868
I'm not proud of it,

06:51.369 --> 06:55.206
but Grandma was sick,
I had to pay for her meds and treatments.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.541
Luis.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.712
I'm Juana Mai, you said to come over
when I had the dates.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.340
Luis.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.177
But the goods
weren't what I thought they were.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.354
Let's go.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.482
Come on, girls, get moving.

07:24.068 --> 07:28.656
I made an anonymous call to the cops
and told them everything I knew.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.702
The entire gang was arrested,

07:32.785 --> 07:36.456
but the guy from Cancún cut a deal
for a reduced sentence.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.752
You think he knows you reported him?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.005
I'm not sure,

07:44.630 --> 07:46.591
but I can't let him find me.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.180
Will you stay for the wedding?

07:53.639 --> 07:56.225
-Whose wedding?
-Pocho and Matilde's.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.978
Isn't that why you came?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.939
Your sister is marrying Pocho?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.944
I don't think that's a good idea.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.865
Me neither, but who can make her
change her mind?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.119
Knowing when pasta is al dente is an art.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.751
There we go.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.466
-Two more minutes. Want to try it?
-Sure.

08:52.657 --> 08:57.119
LORENZO

09:04.752 --> 09:06.254
-No.
-Wait.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.215
Coming!

09:19.392 --> 09:21.686
I phoned and texted you like eight times.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.897
-Sorry. I was busy.
-It's Ana, Val. We found her.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.566
Where? How?

09:26.649 --> 09:31.571
I'll explain on the way to the precinct.
Let's go before she's transferred.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.282
I just need a couple of minutes, please.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.666
-I'll be in the car.
-Sure. I need to go.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.551
-Thanks for everything, Cata.
-I love you!

09:53.634 --> 09:55.428
I hope to see you soon.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.639
I'm so glad we're family.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.227
Thanks for everything, Uncle. Aunt.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.189
-Shall we?
-Yes.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.858
This is your home.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.448
You couldn't even share
five minutes with us.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.408
Not even five.

10:17.491 --> 10:21.746
That's all I asked of you.
Just five minutes.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.914
Let me do that.

10:28.544 --> 10:32.298
You know how the nomination
is affecting me, I'm sorry.

10:33.466 --> 10:38.262
Do you know why 25 years ago
Susana left so suddenly?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.682
Because she was pregnant.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.939
Some poor fool never knew he had a kid.

10:49.857 --> 10:54.612
What's a man supposed to do
if a woman does something like that?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.782
Do you think that can ever be forgiven?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.750
Ana. Look who I brought you.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.378
Ana.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.887
That's not Ana.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.688
VOTER REGISTRATION CARD
ANA VALENCIA

11:30.940 --> 11:32.316
Where did you get this?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.071
Ana is my friend.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.491
Where did you get her ID?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.716
How are you?

11:57.883 --> 12:01.387
Scared to death. Any news about Chango?

12:03.347 --> 12:06.142
I need you to tell the detective
what you know.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.145
He said to call him
the minute you arrived.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.771
Caridad.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.276
The cops can't protect me.
I need to escape.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.570
Talk to him.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.658
I promise to make sure
Chango never finds you again.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.331
If that girl is right
about Ana being in the US,

12:30.332 --> 12:31.709
we'll never find her.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.754
She gave her that ID card.
Let's follow that lead.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.673
I'll never forgive myself.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.176
Ana gave you the information voluntarily,

12:40.259 --> 12:43.345
knowing you'd publish the names
of those bastards.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.808
She was 19. I was the adult there.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.978
I should've known how risky it was.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.398
-If she's dead…
-She's not dead.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.734
You saw the girl.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.737
They don't kill girls like Ana.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.617
The hell those women live in
can be worse than death.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.496
Val.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.456
Val.

13:12.666 --> 13:16.378
FEDERICO: THE PASTA ISN'T AL DENTE.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.345
-I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
-No. We just met.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.974
He took his shirt off
to fix the plumbing or what?

13:36.857 --> 13:38.192
Screw you, asshole.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.739
Hey, Val.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.241
I'm sorry, Val.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.243
I'll take you home.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.622
VOICE MAIL

14:01.215 --> 14:04.218
Hi, Simón, it's Manny.
I haven't heard from you.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.596
How much do you think a newspaper
would pay for my story?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.333
Good morning.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.335
Good morning.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.129
Teresa gave me some key info.

14:40.796 --> 14:44.550
She'd better stay here.
They could trace the informer.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.595
-As long as you need.
-Thank you, Mother.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.723
Thanks for convincing her.

14:51.849 --> 14:56.562
If no women like her are willing to talk,
our hands are tied.

14:57.688 --> 15:02.693
Detective, could you take Sister Caridad
to the hospital to see her mom?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.616
Yes, of course I can.

15:11.744 --> 15:16.457
I decided to hire your band permanently
for three shows per week.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.292
Really?

15:18.792 --> 15:22.504
-Under one condition.
-Anything you say, Daniel.

15:25.257 --> 15:29.345
I want to deal directly with you.
You seem to be more trustworthy.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.892
Any problem?

15:36.226 --> 15:40.940
Why would I say no,
when first of all, I have no papers.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.524
And secondly…

15:44.276 --> 15:46.111
my boyfriend is jealous of you.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.908
I hope you're kidding.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.081
Claudio. Come here.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.004
Meet Matilde Heredia.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.175
Nice to meet you.
Daniel says you have a great voice.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.302
I'd like to hear you sing.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.348
I must go. Bruno must be driving
the neighbors nuts howling for food.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.265
Right.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.810
-See you.
-Take care.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.650
Well, well. Look at you, Daniel!

16:25.192 --> 16:26.986
He's cute.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.542
-Yes?
-My place tomorrow at noon.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.504
Graciela's going out.
Catalina's meeting her friends.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.465
No, meet me somewhere else.

16:49.216 --> 16:52.845
I'm a public figure.
You need to pick up the cash here.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.775
-I hope I'm not imposing.
-Not at all.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.445
I need to speak with you.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.531
Do you know the guy Valentina's dating?

17:17.995 --> 17:19.955
Valentina's dating someone?

17:20.998 --> 17:24.543
-I didn't know.
-If you guys haven't met him, maybe not.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.964
I saw him at her apartment. I was furious.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.926
I have no right,
she hasn't encouraged me, but…

17:33.010 --> 17:35.137
Visiting hours are very strict.

17:35.220 --> 17:39.683
Thanks for the ride.
Have a nice day, detective.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.982
I've recently had a lot of doubts.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.320
And I'm thinking
about leaving the convent.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.115
It's not about Lorenzo.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.205
Although my doubts started
precisely after we met.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.166
Maybe it's about him.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.169
Well. I don't know.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.550
Mom.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.053
Mom.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.057
Mom, I need you to speak to me,
to respond somehow.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.726
I know you're in there somewhere.

18:27.064 --> 18:31.068
My dad didn't have sex only with you
back then.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.989
There were other women.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.158
At least four.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.621
I know because he had daughters
with all of them.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.541
And I know because…

18:48.418 --> 18:50.003
Because I found them.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.092
My birthmark in the form of a fish,

18:55.801 --> 18:57.177
we got it from him.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.473
We are five sisters.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.935
And we're all named Juana.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.562
Mom.

19:08.063 --> 19:08.939
Mom.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.611
-Mom.
-Alice.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.072
Alice. It's okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.158
No!

19:19.241 --> 19:21.368
Alice, breathe.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.080
It's okay, Alice.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.917
I don't remember much about my mom

19:29.001 --> 19:31.753
and there were very few photos of her
at home.

19:32.379 --> 19:36.008
It scares me to think I might see her
and not recognize her.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.553
How do you feel about her?

19:44.641 --> 19:45.684
I don't know.

19:45.767 --> 19:49.146
I just don't understand
why she rejected me.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.356
Maybe she fears that you hate her.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.738
I have a daughter your age
whom I haven't spoken to in ages.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.408
So I think I know how she feels.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.206
Why don't you patch things up
with your daughter?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.208
You'd be a great dad.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.005
Why don't you come to my wedding tomorrow?

20:15.088 --> 20:15.923
Wedding?

20:17.257 --> 20:20.385
Didn't you say you met Pocho
just recently?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.555
Yes, it's for my immigration status.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.808
But he's a great guy.
He treats me like a queen.

20:26.892 --> 20:31.563
All guys treat women as queens at first.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.232
That doesn't mean a thing.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.154
Sorry.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.657
It's none of my business.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
But be careful.
Appearances can be deceiving.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.831
Did you do or say anything to cause this?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.962
We'll give her a tranquilizer
to help her sleep.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.546
We'll be in touch.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.232
Alice.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.234
Be good.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.745
That wasn't so hard, right?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.581
You'll be able to rest now.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.415
I know I should've called,

22:13.498 --> 22:16.626
but I'll be brief,
there's a car waiting for me.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.171
It's a St. James almond cake.

22:19.921 --> 22:25.677
There's a Spanish bakery near the hotel
and I know you love them.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.471
How do I look?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.389
You look great.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.684
Your classmates will be green with envy.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.394
You're so sweet!

22:36.980 --> 22:37.814
Mom.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.277
I forgive you for turning me in.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.741
I know you did it to protect me.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.410
I want you to know that.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.045
Go, the cab will cost a fortune.

23:00.754 --> 23:01.588
I love you.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.799
I'll call you tonight.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.305
There must be another way
to hide one's identity.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.349
Not legally.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.560
There he is.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.208
We are gathered here today
to join this couple in matrimony.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.752
I will begin by…

24:29.384 --> 24:31.636
Can you wait a few minutes? Thanks.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.366
Listen, Manny.

24:54.951 --> 24:58.413
I'd like to have a chance to explain…

24:58.497 --> 25:00.290
Not interested.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.792
-Five minutes.
-The money.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.461
Five minutes.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.434
My relationship with Susana
was very intense.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.812
It was before I married Catalina.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.609
I swear if I had known she was pregnant…

25:27.692 --> 25:29.569
You'd have been a gentleman.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.614
By paying for the abortion, of course.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.332
Manny, I'm sorry
you had such a tough childhood.

25:42.415 --> 25:43.416
No, Simón.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.712
Save your guilty feelings
for a priest, or a shrink.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.009
The money.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.128
How do I know you'll keep your word?

26:29.129 --> 26:31.006
You'll have to trust me, Dad.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.097
The cab couldn't wait any longer
so I paid him.

26:40.265 --> 26:44.769
-No problem. Víctor can take you.
-No. I'd rather take a cab.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.648
Don't be silly, it's too risky out there,
especially with that.

26:49.232 --> 26:52.110
-Take her wherever she wants.
-Sure.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.256
Where to, Miss?

27:14.049 --> 27:18.803
To the north terminal.
But first I need to go to a post office.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.202
Matilde says you're a nun.

27:44.746 --> 27:49.751
I'm not a nun yet, just a novice.
I haven't taken my vows.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.669
Okay.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.595
Giving her away at the altar
was so sweet of you.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.349
It was an honor for her to ask me.

28:06.267 --> 28:10.730
You guys have become
such close friends with her

28:10.814 --> 28:13.733
although Matilde
just came to Mexico, right?

28:15.735 --> 28:16.903
We're not friends.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.030
We're sisters.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.619
Oh! Matilde hasn't told you.

28:27.372 --> 28:31.126
Well, it turns out
that we have the same dad.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.129
Thank you.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.516
What's wrong?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.228
Matilde and the other girls

28:51.396 --> 28:52.355
are sisters.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.274
What?

28:55.650 --> 28:56.484
Really?

28:59.028 --> 29:00.613
Don't leave yet.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.033
I have just enough time
to get to the airport.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.911
I have a surprise for you.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.665
What's this?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.417
MYSTICAL MAYA

29:12.500 --> 29:14.002
It's totally anonymous.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.837
-Is that me?
-Yes.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.673
Please promise me something.

29:19.299 --> 29:23.011
Get out of there quickly.
That place gives me the willies.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.597
Please. You promise?

29:26.723 --> 29:27.724
Yes.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.142
Thanks.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.060
Look.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.980
What right did he have to interrogate you?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.816
Lorenzo worries about you.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.611
He needs to cool it,
it's none of his business,

29:39.694 --> 29:41.780
and he showed up at the worst time.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.283
Or maybe at the best time.

29:47.911 --> 29:48.995
What a mess!

29:51.164 --> 29:52.415
Federico what?

29:57.754 --> 30:00.965
No, don't look at me like that.

30:01.466 --> 30:06.095
We've had more important things to do
than finding out his last name.

30:06.179 --> 30:10.099
So I hope Lorenzo and dumb fate
don't cross paths again,

30:10.183 --> 30:12.811
because I swear I won't be responsible.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.731
It's not fate or any such crap,
just bad luck.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.569
Whatever it is, I need it to change.
I'm crazy over that woman.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.780
What about the money?

30:24.864 --> 30:26.032
No, Fede.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.203
I need a new fermenting vat
and a pump or my garage blows up.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.788
I know. You told me.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.209
-At the end of the month for sure.
-Okay.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.461
Check out my new logo.

30:39.128 --> 30:42.799
WOMAN OF COURAGE CRAFT BEER

30:42.882 --> 30:44.008
"Woman of Courage?"

30:45.051 --> 30:46.928
You're inspired, dude.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.936
Who is she?

30:55.019 --> 30:57.230
Hey! That's my cousin!

30:57.313 --> 30:59.816
It's okay, dude. So, you found a woman?

31:00.650 --> 31:02.694
You've got a new cousin every week.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.114
I'll pick you up Wednesday at 11.

31:08.825 --> 31:09.868
I can't, dude.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.871
Counselor Suárez arrives on Wednesday.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.414
Give me a break, Camilo.

31:14.497 --> 31:17.292
Can't he have another driver
just for this time?

31:17.375 --> 31:21.421
All the local craft beers will be there,
our direct competition.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.549
The guy doesn't like any other driver.

31:25.216 --> 31:29.429
We poor people have to work
until we're rich, period.

31:29.512 --> 31:32.307
You'll make me cry, dude.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.183
Damn oligarch.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.935
Screw you.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.273
I'm so glad you came, Susi.

31:40.356 --> 31:44.777
They tell the same stories
over and over each year.

31:47.822 --> 31:53.244
Cata, what would you think
if I move to Mexico permanently?

31:54.746 --> 31:59.626
Seeing you again is the best thing
that's happened to me in ages,

31:59.709 --> 32:03.254
and I think Manny would like that too.

32:03.338 --> 32:08.927
That would be great for me,
because Federico has his life to live,

32:09.010 --> 32:12.597
and Simón thinks
I'm just a waste of space.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.807
-Don't talk like that.
-It's true.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.228
He only married me
because I was pregnant, but…

32:20.605 --> 32:22.148
he never loved me.

32:22.899 --> 32:26.486
And it's not the tequila that's talking.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.238
I knew it from day one.

32:30.365 --> 32:35.203
No, Susi. I married the wrong guy.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.414
No, honey.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.424
This is Manny. Leave a message.

33:01.604 --> 33:02.480
Hi.

33:03.147 --> 33:07.318
Catalina had too much to drink,
and you were out, so…

33:08.820 --> 33:12.365
Your driver said he'd take me home.
He's waiting.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.282
Okay.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.416
Susana.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.005
Have some coffee.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.008
Simón, please.

33:30.883 --> 33:33.594
We left all that behind a long time ago.

33:37.223 --> 33:40.601
We'd be together if things were different.

33:41.477 --> 33:42.311
I know it.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.983
But I couldn't do that to Catalina.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.526
-No.
-You understand?

33:49.235 --> 33:50.903
I'd never ask you to do that.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.240
I know and I appreciate that.

33:55.658 --> 33:59.495
Thanks for keeping the secret.
We'd have broken her heart.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.291
Nobody else knows, just you and I.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.546
-Not even Manny?
-No, she must never find out.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.967
I'm not proud of it.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.095
It's for the best.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.734
It's done, boss.

34:51.631 --> 34:53.883
This is Manny. Leave your message.

35:03.684 --> 35:04.519
Manny.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.618
ST. JAMES ALMOND CAKE

36:01.075 --> 36:04.245
I'm done, boss.
There's not a trace left of anything.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.419
