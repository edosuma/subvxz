00:00.834 --> 00:02.168
<i>Hot in Clevelandis recorded</i>

00:02.202 --> 00:04.637
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:06.038 --> 00:07.096
Hi, Elka.

00:07.130 --> 00:09.721
It's good to be home.
Warm smile.

00:09.756 --> 00:13.286
Why did she say "Warm smile"?

00:13.320 --> 00:18.423
Our faces are frozen
from a special form of Botox.

00:19.224 --> 00:21.822
So for the next 24 hours,

00:21.856 --> 00:24.143
the only way we can express
our emotions is to say them.

00:25.527 --> 00:28.748
Slightly embarrassed
from the situation red face.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.737
Why would you fly
to Los Angeles

00:32.876 --> 00:34.645
to get your face frozen?

00:34.679 --> 00:36.317
Couldn't you just stay here

00:36.351 --> 00:39.522
and stick your heads
in a snow drift?

00:39.556 --> 00:41.757
We have to get
our treatments in L.A.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.226
Because that's
where Dr. Minton is.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.527
That man is a genius.

00:45.562 --> 00:48.730
Dr. Minton is the best
dermatologist in the country.

00:48.764 --> 00:51.332
He's the reason
we don't look unnatural.

00:53.201 --> 00:55.403
Every A-list celebrity
goes to him.

00:55.437 --> 00:57.704
How did you get in?

00:57.739 --> 01:00.741
We have a gateway friend.

01:00.775 --> 01:02.742
A gateway friend is someone

01:02.777 --> 01:05.611
who can get you
into every place exclusive.

01:05.646 --> 01:07.248
Our gateway friend

01:07.283 --> 01:10.385
is Dr. Minton's receptionist/
girlfriend Courtney.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.489
When we're in L.A.,
I do her eyebrows

01:12.523 --> 01:13.958
and Victoria takes her
to premieres

01:13.992 --> 01:16.295
in exchange for appointments.

01:16.329 --> 01:19.365
What do you do for her?

01:19.399 --> 01:23.602
Not really caring.

01:23.636 --> 01:27.406
I listen to her
relationship problems.

01:27.441 --> 01:28.875
Yes, for the past three days,

01:28.909 --> 01:31.377
Melanie has had a fake smile
plastered on her face

01:31.411 --> 01:34.413
just so she could get a fake
smile plastered on her face.

01:34.448 --> 01:37.983
Oh, that's Courtney now.

01:38.017 --> 01:39.886
Hey, Court, what's up?

01:39.921 --> 01:41.287
Uh-huh.

01:41.322 --> 01:42.956
Uh-huh. What?

01:42.990 --> 01:44.958
Look of panic.

01:46.761 --> 01:50.631
Of course you can come
stay with us in Cleveland

01:50.666 --> 01:52.000
and cry on our shoulders.

01:52.034 --> 01:55.770
Oh, okay, we'll see you
when you get here.

01:55.805 --> 01:58.173
Bye-bye.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.808
She broke up
with Dr. Minton

01:59.842 --> 02:02.244
and quit her job
as his receptionist.

02:02.279 --> 02:04.247
We lost our gateway?

02:04.282 --> 02:06.917
Jaw drop, Melanie, jaw drop.

02:07.963 --> 02:16.844
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www. addic7ed. com</font>

02:18.437 --> 02:20.500
Have your faces unfrozen yet?

02:20.534 --> 02:24.771
Because I wanna see
anger and outrage.

02:24.806 --> 02:26.506
Why, what's up?

02:28.342 --> 02:30.443
"Help keep Cleveland
the forest city. "

02:30.478 --> 02:33.880
"Save 100-year-old historic
oak tree from destruction. "

02:33.914 --> 02:35.781
But this is at the end
of our block.

02:35.816 --> 02:36.782
Why would someone want
to get rid

02:36.817 --> 02:38.050
of that beautiful old tree?

02:38.085 --> 02:39.885
A developer bought the lot

02:39.920 --> 02:41.487
and he plans to bulldoze it.

02:41.521 --> 02:43.122
Oh, that's terrible.

02:43.157 --> 02:44.958
They wanna put in a day spa.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.893
- Finally, oh!
- That's fantastic.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.164
Elka, I'm sorry.

02:50.198 --> 02:52.099
But that means that
we'd have a day spa,

02:52.134 --> 02:55.804
a wine bar, and a fire station,
all within walking distance.

02:55.838 --> 02:59.541
Oh, it's the single ladies+
holy trinity.

03:01.511 --> 03:03.746
- Can someone open the door?
- Yeah-yeah.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.848
We're coming.

03:05.882 --> 03:08.183
Hello, girls.

03:08.217 --> 03:13.155
Oh, hello, Courtney.

03:13.189 --> 03:14.723
Can you give me a hand?

03:14.757 --> 03:15.924
She fainted getting out
of the car.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.533 --> 03:26.368
Thank you,
I feel much better now.

03:26.402 --> 03:29.271
I just got lightheaded
from the lack of smog.

03:29.305 --> 03:30.739
Right, honey,
we should've warned you.

03:30.774 --> 03:32.741
If you haven't been outside
of L.A. in quite a while,

03:32.776 --> 03:35.778
the pure oxygen
can be overwhelming.

03:35.813 --> 03:37.647
Yeah, sometimes
when I get homesick,

03:37.682 --> 03:40.450
I let the car run
with the garage door closed.

03:40.485 --> 03:42.519
Oh, springtime
in L.A.

03:42.553 --> 03:45.189
How are your faces doing?

03:46.758 --> 03:47.725
Excellent.

03:47.759 --> 03:50.294
No visible lines.

03:50.329 --> 03:52.964
Everything looks
to be in order.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.270
How did this happen?

03:58.304 --> 04:00.739
I'm 90.

04:00.773 --> 04:04.410
Since everyone lies
about their age by at least 20,

04:04.444 --> 04:06.979
that makes you 110.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.315
I'm 90.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.452
How long have you been
without oxygen?

04:12.487 --> 04:15.122
Well, I moved
to L.A. in 1980...

04:15.156 --> 04:18.259
Hey, you're trying to get me
to reveal my real age.

04:18.293 --> 04:21.829
She's good.

04:21.863 --> 04:24.599
Courtney, we are delighted
that you came to us

04:24.633 --> 04:27.000
in your time of need,
but isn't there any way

04:27.035 --> 04:29.436
that you could patch things up
with Dr. Minton?

04:29.470 --> 04:32.939
No, and now you've got me
sobbing again.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.308
I don't see any tears.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.443
The last time
Dr. Minton and I broke up,

04:37.477 --> 04:39.411
he said he would never
make me cry again.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.947
So he removed my tear ducks.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.817
Genius.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.521
Well, I'm off to save a tree

04:48.556 --> 04:50.691
let me know how
this all turns out.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.259
Or don't.

04:52.294 --> 04:54.328
I don't really care.

04:56.865 --> 04:59.534
Do you mind if I use
your powder room?

04:59.568 --> 05:01.136
I just started
an aggressive round

05:01.170 --> 05:03.339
of experimental face cream,
and every two hours

05:03.373 --> 05:05.875
I have to make sure my skin
isn't eating itself.

05:05.909 --> 05:09.145
Yeah, sure, it's down
the hall, to the left.

05:09.179 --> 05:12.448
- Thank you.
- Okay.

05:12.482 --> 05:13.883
Okay, this is gonna
be harder than we thought.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.184
We talked in the car.

05:15.218 --> 05:17.153
She swears it is over
between her and Dr. Minton.

05:17.187 --> 05:20.823
There is no way it's over
until we say it's over.

05:20.858 --> 05:23.393
No, it's time to pull out
the big guns.

05:23.427 --> 05:26.330
I say we try
the three-pronged attack.

05:26.364 --> 05:29.566
Agreed. I'll take "Cold,
hard facts for women over 40."

05:29.601 --> 05:31.234
And I will do "Yes, but"s.

05:31.269 --> 05:33.337
And I'll make up
a pathetic single friend

05:33.371 --> 05:34.705
as a cautionary tale.

05:34.740 --> 05:39.410
Just don't call her
"Joy" this time.

05:39.444 --> 05:41.479
But it's such a good name

05:41.513 --> 05:44.982
for someone who's
a complete mess.

05:45.017 --> 05:46.050
Don't take it personally.

05:46.084 --> 05:50.521
Oh, here she comes.

05:50.555 --> 05:54.425
There were no prescriptions
in your medicine cabinet.

05:54.459 --> 05:57.394
How do you stay happy here?

05:57.428 --> 05:59.096
Oh, we're always happy here.

05:59.130 --> 06:01.164
Unless one of us
is going through a break-up.

06:01.198 --> 06:03.466
- Mm.
- Which reminds me-

06:03.500 --> 06:07.070
Did you know a single woman
over 40 is more likely

06:07.104 --> 06:08.704
to be attacked by an ostrich

06:08.739 --> 06:11.708
than meet a new man
after a break-up?

06:13.077 --> 06:15.145
That's a frightening statistic.

06:15.179 --> 06:16.346
Still, I think
I could do better

06:16.380 --> 06:17.747
than someone who afraid
of commitment.

06:17.782 --> 06:20.017
Yes, but... could you?

06:20.051 --> 06:21.585
I think so.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.788
Yes, but... really?

06:23.822 --> 06:25.056
Maybe.

06:25.090 --> 06:28.092
Yes, but... seriously?

06:28.127 --> 06:30.595
I never thought of it
like that.

06:32.665 --> 06:34.667
You know, a-
a similar thing happened

06:34.701 --> 06:35.701
to my friend Joy.

06:35.736 --> 06:37.136
Not this Joy.

06:37.170 --> 06:40.440
Uh, two years ago, she got out
of a tong-term relationship,

06:40.474 --> 06:42.375
and right now,
she is living on her own

06:42.409 --> 06:44.577
in a studio apartment
in Reseda.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.246
The valley?

06:47.915 --> 06:49.048
I am just so proud of her.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.418
I mean, she doesn't need
a man to be happy.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.320
That's what her
52 cats are for.

06:54.355 --> 06:56.223
Oh, my God,
you girls are right.

06:56.257 --> 06:58.091
I have to get back together
with Dr. Minton.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.092
I don't wanna be like Joy.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.428
Oh, none does.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.631
What?

07:11.472 --> 07:14.241
Is this the valley?

07:15.944 --> 07:18.379
We keep telling you
Cleveland doesn't have a valley.

07:18.413 --> 07:20.248
Looks like the valley.

07:20.282 --> 07:22.516
Come on, come on.
We're here to celebrate.

07:22.551 --> 07:24.518
You're getting back together
with a Beverly Hills doctor.

07:24.553 --> 07:26.220
You're right.
A round of drinks,

07:26.254 --> 07:28.422
and then off to the airport.

07:30.025 --> 07:32.193
Wait, all the men
are looking at me.

07:32.227 --> 07:33.762
Well, that's what men do here.

07:33.796 --> 07:37.265
I remember that look.
It's desire.

07:37.299 --> 07:38.733
Isn't that funny?

07:38.767 --> 07:40.601
That's what we said the first
time we came to Cleveland.

07:40.636 --> 07:42.370
Oh, my God,
they're positively leering.

07:42.404 --> 07:45.773
Even guys younger than
my fake age are looking at me.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.177
Uh-oh.

07:49.211 --> 07:52.280
I'm gonna do something
I haven't done in 20 years-

07:52.315 --> 07:55.617
relax my stomach muscles.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.688
Oh, my God,
they're still looking.

07:59.722 --> 08:01.056
Melanie, your Christmas
letters were true.

08:01.090 --> 08:03.358
- Yes, but-
- "Yes, but" nothing.

08:03.393 --> 08:05.060
These animals
view me as nothing

08:05.094 --> 08:06.961
but a mindless sex object,

08:06.995 --> 08:08.496
and I'm gonna go show them
that they're right.

08:08.530 --> 08:13.501
Hi, I'm Courtney.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.535
We're idiots.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.303
It was a mistake coming here.

08:17.338 --> 08:20.407
We should've kept her isolated
from the indigenous population.

08:20.441 --> 08:22.475
I don't know
what's worse-

08:22.510 --> 08:25.078
you telling outsiders
about our special powers here,

08:25.112 --> 08:26.813
or that you're still
wring Christmas letters.

08:26.848 --> 08:30.818
People like
my Christmas letters.

08:30.852 --> 08:32.486
Look, this city is our secret.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.389
Now what if she tells
other women?

08:34.423 --> 08:36.957
Cleveland will be overrun
with desperate refugees

08:36.993 --> 08:41.197
from Beverly Hills, and then
it really will be the valley.

08:41.231 --> 08:43.465
We've got to get her
out of here

08:43.500 --> 08:45.000
before she becomes
completely intoxicated

08:45.034 --> 08:46.268
with the magic of Cleveland.

08:46.302 --> 08:49.004
Okay, but you do have
to drive her to the airport,

08:49.038 --> 08:51.607
because it's karaoke night,
and my fans will be disappointed

08:51.641 --> 08:53.409
if I don't
sing "Wonderwall. "

08:53.443 --> 08:55.244
It's kind of my jam.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.182
Seven men just offered
to buy me a drink.

09:00.216 --> 09:01.884
But the bartender
wouldn't serve me

09:01.918 --> 09:04.319
until I showed him
my I.D.,

09:04.354 --> 09:06.688
which I refused to do because
it would break the spell.

09:06.723 --> 09:08.090
So now one of you
have to go get me a drink.

09:08.124 --> 09:09.224
Oh, no, we can't
because we have to get you

09:09.259 --> 09:10.526
to the airport
as soon as possible.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.861
- Why?
- Uh...

09:11.895 --> 09:13.462
They moved your flight up.

09:13.496 --> 09:15.564
Flights don't get moved up.

09:15.598 --> 09:16.632
Until now.

09:16.666 --> 09:17.967
Everyone but you
got there early,

09:18.001 --> 09:19.802
and they said,
"Oh, let's do it. "

09:21.304 --> 09:22.871
Who care if I miss it?

09:22.906 --> 09:24.272
They love me here.

09:24.307 --> 09:26.708
There's no way I'm getting
on a plane tonight.

09:28.143 --> 09:30.745
Oh, hi.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.981
Oh, my God, I feel
a frown breaking through.

09:34.983 --> 09:38.585
â™ª You â™ª

09:43.518 --> 09:46.293
Thank you, Cleveland.

09:46.327 --> 09:47.761
Okay, okay,
everyone settle down,

09:47.796 --> 09:49.897
settle down.
Time for results.

09:49.931 --> 09:52.633
First place-no surprise
here-goes to...

09:52.668 --> 09:55.570
Courtney Pice.

09:59.476 --> 10:02.477
Second place goes to...
Cleveland Browns

10:02.512 --> 10:04.713
star kick return specialist-
this man just came in

10:04.747 --> 10:06.548
to ask for directions,
and stayed to sing

10:06.583 --> 10:08.684
"Wind Beneath my Wings"-
Josh Cribbs!

10:12.955 --> 10:15.991
And third place
goes to Joy Hoggs.

10:16.025 --> 10:17.925
That's "Scroggs. "

10:21.329 --> 10:23.564
I can't believe I lost.

10:23.598 --> 10:24.965
Hey, I'm bummed too.

10:24.999 --> 10:29.436
I have two passions in life-
football and karaoke.

10:29.470 --> 10:33.506
Fortunately for me,
one of them pays really well.

10:33.540 --> 10:34.540
It's football.

10:36.209 --> 10:37.776
Thank you, everybody.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.611
And don't worry,
I'll be back next week

10:39.646 --> 10:41.947
to defend my title because...

10:41.981 --> 10:45.016
I'm moving to Cleveland!

10:48.821 --> 10:53.025
Courtney!
Courtney! Courtney!

10:54.300 --> 10:56.433
Thank you for
supporting the cause.

10:56.841 --> 10:58.642
To be perfectly honest,
we wanted an excuse

10:58.676 --> 10:59.876
to get away from Courtney.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.675
She's so superficial
and shallow,

11:02.710 --> 11:05.311
and all about how men
respond to her appearance.

11:05.345 --> 11:07.805
Yeah, don't you just hate
women like that?

11:11.060 --> 11:13.819
So how come you like
is tree so much?

11:13.853 --> 11:17.522
I've been walking past it
for 60 years.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.258
Oh, if it gets cut down,

11:19.292 --> 11:20.959
it would be like
losing a friend.

11:20.994 --> 11:22.327
- Mm.
- Aww.

11:22.362 --> 11:25.130
A real friend,
not a gateway friend.

11:25.164 --> 11:26.632
Turns out our gateway friend's

11:26.666 --> 11:28.300
gonna be our new
neighbor friend.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.102
Courtney's staying
in Cleveland.

11:30.136 --> 11:31.437
And if we can't get her
back to L.A.,

11:31.471 --> 11:34.272
there is no chance she can
reconcile with Dr. Minton.

11:34.307 --> 11:36.675
Isn't this where
you three knuckleheads

11:36.709 --> 11:38.510
come up with
some harebrained scheme,

11:38.544 --> 11:40.946
and I tell you it's stupid,
and you do it anyway?

11:40.981 --> 11:44.383
Way ahead
of you. Smile.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.854
Dr. Minton, thank you
so much for coming.

11:48.889 --> 11:51.357
I flew out as soon as I saw
that picture of Victoria.

11:51.391 --> 11:53.959
- Where is she?
- I'm right here.

11:53.993 --> 11:58.964
Victoria!

11:58.999 --> 12:01.367
What did you do to your face?

12:01.401 --> 12:02.534
Did you get it wet?

12:03.737 --> 12:06.872
You know my treatments
are not FDA approved.

12:06.907 --> 12:08.741
They're not?

12:10.110 --> 12:12.978
- When did this happen?
- Overnight.

12:13.012 --> 12:16.215
Like in that lifetime
original movie

12:16.249 --> 12:18.851
where I switch bodies
with Hilary Duff

12:18.885 --> 12:21.587
<i>called Switcheroo Summer.</i>

12:21.621 --> 12:24.189
I'm ruined.

12:24.224 --> 12:27.493
You're ruined?
I have a callback tomorrow

12:27.528 --> 12:29.896
<i>on CSI: Miami.</i>

12:29.930 --> 12:34.667
<i>Miami
is on hiatus.</i>

12:34.702 --> 12:38.004
You're not Victoria.
Who are you?

12:38.039 --> 12:41.174
I told you not
to go off-book.

12:41.209 --> 12:44.278
And I told you I don't know
what that means.

12:47.316 --> 12:48.783
What is going on?

12:48.818 --> 12:51.219
Look, we brought you here
to talk about Courtney.

12:51.254 --> 12:52.754
Now don't you still love her?

12:52.788 --> 12:56.958
I do, truly.
I always will, but...

12:56.992 --> 12:58.659
I'm not ready to settle down.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.394
I'm only 65.

13:01.663 --> 13:03.897
You're 65?

13:03.931 --> 13:06.032
I'm very good at what I do.

13:06.066 --> 13:08.101
But at your age,

13:08.135 --> 13:10.302
can you really continue
this Peter Pan lifestyle?

13:10.337 --> 13:12.004
Well, I'm in my 60s,

13:12.038 --> 13:14.506
but thanks to hair plugs
and extensive plastic surgery,

13:14.540 --> 13:15.708
I could pass for 38.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.644
You can knock off
another ten years,

13:18.646 --> 13:19.912
bringing me down to 28.

13:19.946 --> 13:22.648
I drive a Porsche, which
knocks off another five years,

13:22.682 --> 13:24.116
minus two more
because it's a convertible.

13:24.151 --> 13:28.321
When you do the math,
I'm barely old enough to drink.

13:31.558 --> 13:33.893
- Courtney?
- Dr. Minton?

13:33.927 --> 13:37.563
- Josh Cribbs?
- Dr. Minton?

13:37.597 --> 13:39.765
I thought you said he was dead.

13:39.799 --> 13:43.068
- He is to me.
- Cribbs.

13:43.102 --> 13:44.936
What the hell, man?

13:44.971 --> 13:47.171
I had you on my fantasy team,

13:47.206 --> 13:49.607
you went out with a groin injury
in the Steelers game.

13:49.641 --> 13:51.275
You really wreed
my whole season.

13:51.309 --> 13:53.744
Well, that must've been
painful for you.

13:53.778 --> 13:55.913
Almost as painful
as a groin injury.

13:57.415 --> 13:59.083
What are you doing here?

13:59.117 --> 14:00.551
Came to see Victoria,

14:00.585 --> 14:04.756
but now that I see you, I-
I really miss you, Courtney.

14:04.790 --> 14:06.592
Enough to marry me?

14:06.626 --> 14:10.429
Maybe. Someday.
Not yet.

14:10.463 --> 14:12.565
Well, fine, I'll just
marry Josh Cribbs.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.434
Wait, what?

14:14.468 --> 14:17.303
Okay, this is getting
a little too weird for me.

14:17.337 --> 14:18.571
Good night, everyone.

14:18.606 --> 14:21.274
I think what that large
football man is trying

14:21.309 --> 14:25.146
to tell us is that you two
obviously belong together.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.515
You know, he's right.

14:27.549 --> 14:30.518
Come on, Gaby, let's go back
to the way things were.

14:30.553 --> 14:32.854
Why should I?
In L.A., a woman my age

14:32.889 --> 14:34.389
has to take whatever
she can get.

14:34.423 --> 14:36.091
But here in Cleveland,
I can get whatever I want

14:36.125 --> 14:37.492
and whomever I want.

14:37.527 --> 14:41.797
I don't have to date
a 65-year-old senior citizen.

14:41.831 --> 14:44.500
Are you really going
to play the age card,

14:44.534 --> 14:46.368
Miss Born in 1960-

14:49.406 --> 14:52.609
Well, the joke is on you.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.011
You forgot that I lost
all feeling in my cheeks

14:55.045 --> 14:56.679
after my last skin graft.

14:56.714 --> 15:00.884
I literally have the face
of a man half my age.

15:01.889 --> 15:03.397
Genes.

15:09.331 --> 15:10.297
- Hi.
- Dr. Minton.

15:10.332 --> 15:11.665
What are you doing here?

15:11.700 --> 15:13.467
I was on my way to the airport,

15:13.501 --> 15:16.069
but I turned around because
I couldn't stop thinking

15:16.103 --> 15:17.804
about your face.

15:17.838 --> 15:21.007
- Oh, I get that a lot.
- Yeah.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.643
I was drawn to it,
and I couldn't figure out why,

15:23.678 --> 15:27.382
but now I remember. You-
you look like my grandmother.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.919
Before she made me
make her look young

15:30.954 --> 15:33.455
and she started
dressing like Kesha.

15:33.490 --> 15:38.461
I'm proud of my wrinkles.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.830
I earned every line.

15:40.864 --> 15:43.299
Just like this
gnarled old tree.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.567
It's a beautiful tree.

15:44.602 --> 15:49.339
In Los Angeles, our trees
are cell phone towers.

15:49.373 --> 15:52.943
There's beauty in things
that are naturally old.

15:52.978 --> 15:54.812
That's why I wanna protect it.

15:54.846 --> 15:57.881
Ah, I can see why.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.985
Although I would shave off a few
of these limbs for symmetry.

16:02.019 --> 16:05.054
Maybe take this bump out,
make it look less ethnic.

16:06.957 --> 16:08.658
Sorry. Habit.

16:08.692 --> 16:12.562
You and that tiny girl
back at my house

16:12.596 --> 16:15.031
are perfect for each other.

16:15.065 --> 16:16.032
What's the story there?

16:16.066 --> 16:17.800
I love Courtney.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.835
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:19.870 --> 16:21.504
Well, then
why dot you marry her?

16:21.538 --> 16:24.107
I'm too young to get married.

16:24.142 --> 16:27.511
Not growing up is not the same
as being young.

16:27.545 --> 16:30.847
I hear what you're saying.

16:30.882 --> 16:33.250
But a leopard
can't change its spots.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.320
It can if it finds
the tiny leopard

16:36.354 --> 16:38.221
it wants to change for.

16:38.256 --> 16:40.357
Wow, you don't give up, do you?

16:40.391 --> 16:41.858
- Mm-mm.
- Now you really remind me

16:41.893 --> 16:43.293
of my grandmother.

16:43.327 --> 16:46.963
Minus the miniskirt
and the body glitter.

16:46.997 --> 16:49.632
I've got a flight to catch.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.200
- Whoo...
- Oh, are you okay?

16:51.235 --> 16:53.302
Yeah, this old oak

16:53.337 --> 16:56.339
really pumps out
the oxygen, doesn't it?

17:01.944 --> 17:04.613
- Courtney.
- Dr. Minton.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.885
He fell out of my tree.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.587
Why didn't you tell us?

17:11.622 --> 17:13.022
I told her not to.

17:13.057 --> 17:16.093
I couldn't think of a way
to make it home off sexy.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.896
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:18.931 --> 17:21.999
But at the hospital,
they made me give my real age.

17:22.034 --> 17:24.602
That plus some stuff Elka said
to me got me thinking.

17:24.636 --> 17:26.203
Well, she's done
a lot of living

17:26.238 --> 17:28.305
in her 110 years.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.940
I'm 90.

17:29.975 --> 17:32.309
Of course you are.

17:34.045 --> 17:36.346
The reason I've tried
to stay young

17:36.381 --> 17:37.781
was so that I would have
enough time

17:37.815 --> 17:39.282
to find the perfect woman.

17:39.317 --> 17:41.351
But now I realize
that the person

17:41.385 --> 17:43.954
I ha been searching for
all this time

17:43.989 --> 17:45.689
was just outside my office do.

17:45.724 --> 17:47.859
Aww.

17:47.893 --> 17:50.195
Why are you three gushing?

17:50.229 --> 17:53.298
That line is from
every romantic comedy ever.

17:53.333 --> 17:58.638
We're from Hollywood, where
originality is frowned upon.

17:58.672 --> 18:01.140
Courtney...

18:01.175 --> 18:03.476
Will you marry me?

18:03.510 --> 18:06.179
Yes.

18:06.213 --> 18:08.881
Aw, she makes him
want to be a better man.

18:08.916 --> 18:11.718
He had her
at "Hello. "

18:11.752 --> 18:15.388
I weep for your generation.

18:15.422 --> 18:17.757
Any ideas on a date yet?

18:17.791 --> 18:19.358
We're due back in L.A.
in six months

18:19.393 --> 18:20.660
for our follow-up
appointments.

18:20.694 --> 18:22.461
Well, by that time,
I wanna be married to Courtney,

18:22.496 --> 18:23.829
living in Cleveland
and complaining

18:23.864 --> 18:25.932
- about the Indians' bullpen.
- What?

18:25.967 --> 18:28.202
That is, if it's okay with you.

18:28.236 --> 18:30.538
Of course. I don't care
where we live,

18:30.572 --> 18:33.340
as long as I'm
Mrs. Dr. Minton.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.809
There are little puffs of air

18:34.843 --> 18:37.211
coming out of her eyes.

18:37.245 --> 18:40.515
I'm crying.

18:40.549 --> 18:42.416
So are you really
gonna move to Cleveland?

18:42.451 --> 18:44.819
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna outbid
the day spa people,

18:44.853 --> 18:45.886
build an office on that lot,

18:45.921 --> 18:47.221
and keep the old oak.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.990
Oh, thank you.

18:49.024 --> 18:50.391
This is fabulous.

18:50.426 --> 18:51.526
So we lose a day spa,

18:51.560 --> 18:54.061
but we gain
a celebrity dermatologist.

18:54.095 --> 18:57.497
Oh, no, I'm not gonna practice
the vanity arts in Cleveland.

18:57.532 --> 19:00.234
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

19:00.268 --> 19:03.103
I wanna focus on real
dermatological problems

19:03.138 --> 19:05.439
like ringworm and psoriasis.

19:05.473 --> 19:07.341
No more silly
fountain of youth stuff.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.042
You're still gonna
do me, right?

19:09.077 --> 19:11.545
Well, yeah, of course.
I have to have a hot wife.

19:12.914 --> 19:15.082
Dr. Minton.

19:15.116 --> 19:18.986
Besides, they were this close
to shutting down

19:19.020 --> 19:20.721
my clinic in L.A.

19:20.755 --> 19:22.523
Why?

19:22.557 --> 19:24.225
No reason.

19:28.928 --> 19:31.458
Okay, well, I've done my
research, and there are a number

19:31.486 --> 19:33.829
of places we could get our Botox
done here in Cleveland.

19:33.863 --> 19:35.664
In fact, there's one here
where we can use a Groupon.

19:35.698 --> 19:39.902
Groupon Botox, Melanie?
Has it come to that?

19:39.936 --> 19:44.006
Even my pathetic friend, Joy-
not you, Joy-

19:44.041 --> 19:45.875
wouldn't stoop that low.

19:45.909 --> 19:48.744
Well, I guess we could just
accept life as it comes.

19:48.779 --> 19:51.113
- What, age naturally?
- Hmm.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.048
We've never thought out that.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.583
We could give it a try.

19:56.969 --> 19:59.688
I have a major
announcement to make.

19:59.722 --> 20:04.526
We have been Botox-free
for three years.

20:05.008 --> 20:14.397
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www. addic7ed. com</font>

20:14.906 --> 20:18.142
On second thought, Cleveland
Botox doesn't sound that bad.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.579
Print that Groupon,
Melanie, print it.

20:21.613 --> 20:24.253
- Done and done.
- To fighting nature.

20:24.373 --> 20:26.306
- To fighting nature.
- To fighting nature.
