WEBVTT

00:08.922 --> 00:10.856
Call it in to dispatch.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.491
Okay.

00:16.930 --> 00:19.341
Mom, it's Tommy.

00:19.391 --> 00:23.302
I... I've been in an accident.

00:23.336 --> 00:25.641
I'm so sorry.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.586
I'm sorry. Mom?

00:27.621 --> 00:28.524
Mom?

00:28.558 --> 00:30.393
Mom?

00:30.427 --> 00:33.070
- Yes. Yes.
- A... are you okay?

00:33.071 --> 00:35.837
You're staring at that tomato
paste like it's gonna attack you.

00:35.838 --> 00:38.346
No, I'm j... I'm just getting
the paper plates and napkins.

00:38.347 --> 00:40.784
- That's all.
- Are you sure you're ready for this?

00:40.818 --> 00:43.394
Look, we can just pretend it's
a welcome home dinner and then...

00:43.395 --> 00:45.599
no, no, no, Tommy. Now's the time.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.933
Nora?

00:47.967 --> 00:49.669
Nora?

00:49.703 --> 00:51.236
Where are you?

00:51.270 --> 00:52.434
- Hey, Saul.
- Tommy.

00:52.435 --> 00:55.230
Hey, long time no see. Mwah.
Hey. Wow. Good to see you.

00:55.231 --> 00:57.307
You, too. So tell me,
what is this all about?

00:57.308 --> 01:00.243
- I have no idea, but it should be interesting.
- Hey.

01:00.278 --> 01:01.990
Surprise. Look who's here.

01:01.991 --> 01:03.777
Yeah, I'm the, uh, mystery guest.

01:03.778 --> 01:06.049
- Oh, God. It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too. I love the hair.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.654
Well, thanks. Thanks. It's my own.

01:09.084 --> 01:11.579
- Oh, my... Tommy!
- Hey.

01:11.580 --> 01:15.629
- How are ya?
- Hey. Oh, my God. You look so good.

01:15.630 --> 01:17.547
Okay, what does everyone want to eat?

01:17.548 --> 01:21.197
Uh, Thai? Chinese? Indian?

01:21.198 --> 01:22.480
- Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- What?

01:22.481 --> 01:23.914
You're ordering takeout?

01:23.915 --> 01:25.884
- Tommy?
- Oh, hey, bro. How are ya?

01:25.919 --> 01:29.022
- Guys. I'm good. How are you?
- Good, you know?

01:29.056 --> 01:30.267
Oh, look at you. You look great.

01:30.268 --> 01:32.203
So, um, what's... what's going on?

01:32.271 --> 01:36.305
Well, uh, Tommy's here,
mom's ordering takeout,

01:36.306 --> 01:38.571
uh, so welcome to Bizarro world.

01:38.572 --> 01:40.879
We just got in. I haven't
had time to cook anything.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.327
See? I knew she went somewhere.

01:42.328 --> 01:44.199
- Shut up.
- Look, Tommy had a few days off.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.050
- I... I just flew up to see him.
- And don't you worry.

01:46.051 --> 01:48.820
I told her, next time she goes
away, you have to tell someone.

01:48.821 --> 01:50.759
Yeah, the only reason why we
didn't think you were abducted

01:50.760 --> 01:52.504
was because the
thermostat was turned down.

01:52.505 --> 01:55.205
Okay, Tommy, what's the occasion?

01:55.206 --> 01:56.475
Are you engaged?

01:56.476 --> 01:58.329
- Oh, let me guess... you've been arrested again?
- You met someone?

01:58.330 --> 01:59.428
You did? You did? You met someone?

01:59.429 --> 02:01.165
- Kidding, kidding.
- No, no, no, no. What's with the 20 questions?

02:01.166 --> 02:03.334
Just stop, okay? He's here for a visit.

02:03.335 --> 02:04.467
Let's not harass him.

02:04.468 --> 02:06.323
Well, maybe if you told
us why he was here, mom,

02:06.324 --> 02:08.743
- instead of calling the mysterious emergency meeting...
- Oh,

02:08.744 --> 02:10.868
I swear this family has
more meetings than the mob.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.305
I'm gonna tell you everything,

02:12.306 --> 02:15.027
-but let's decide what we wanna order first.
-Uh, Thai.

02:15.028 --> 02:19.110
-Thai, yeah. Thai, Thai, Thai, Thai,
-Thai. So talk.

02:26.101 --> 02:28.824
Okay. Okay. Um...

02:28.825 --> 02:32.722
So as I think you all know,
a company called Obstfeld

02:32.723 --> 02:35.079
tried to buy Holly's shares of Ojai Foods.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.244
But Holly refused to sell them, right?

02:37.245 --> 02:38.903
That... that's right. She didn't sell.

02:38.938 --> 02:41.339
Now they've come to us
with an incredible offer

02:41.373 --> 02:43.307
- to buy our shares...
- What?

02:43.342 --> 02:46.105
- And I was thinking...
- It's... oh, whoa.

02:46.106 --> 02:49.715
I'm sorry. You're
seriously considering this?

02:49.749 --> 02:52.218
Sarah, I know what Ojai means to you,

02:52.252 --> 02:54.588
what it really means to this whole family.

02:54.622 --> 02:57.151
But it's also been an
albatross around our necks...

02:57.152 --> 03:00.100
the financial difficulties,
the family disputes.

03:00.101 --> 03:01.535
Well, we've worked through those.

03:01.536 --> 03:04.485
I'm just thinking that maybe we
don't need this baggage anymore.

03:04.486 --> 03:07.054
You all have your own
lives. Maybe it's time.

03:07.089 --> 03:09.998
- Cash in, move on.
- I can't believe I'm hearing this.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.766
A month ago, you were telling me

03:11.767 --> 03:14.483
that Ojai was practically
our family religion.

03:14.484 --> 03:18.005
Sarah. They're offering us a lot of money.

03:18.006 --> 03:20.008
So that's why you came down here,

03:20.042 --> 03:22.477
to help mom lobby us to sell our shares?

03:22.512 --> 03:25.529
- And you, too, Saul?
- Sarah, honey, listen to me.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.866
Think about it. You've always
had to be the breadwinner.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.231
But this... this would take
the pressure off of you.

03:31.232 --> 03:33.227
You could enjoy your kids and Luc.

03:33.228 --> 03:35.527
And do what, mom, become a '50s housewife?

03:35.528 --> 03:38.533
- This is my career.
- You wouldn't have to juggle so much.

03:38.534 --> 03:41.121
- I like to juggle.
- Wait a second. Is this about Narrow Lake?

03:41.122 --> 03:42.516
What's Narrow Lake?

03:42.517 --> 03:44.351
- Nothing.
- That's not what Holly says.

03:44.385 --> 03:45.789
Holly says this is a piece of property

03:45.790 --> 03:48.182
that's worth a lot of money,
that apparently, Ojai owns.

03:48.183 --> 03:50.343
- What?
- Okay, how do I not know about this?

03:50.344 --> 03:51.707
- Because it's nothing.
- Well, obviously,

03:51.708 --> 03:54.279
- it's not nothing, mom, if even Justin knows about it.
- Whoa.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.815
- Holly has been looking into this for a month...
- What?

03:56.850 --> 03:58.618
And there's nothing there. Nothing.

03:58.652 --> 04:01.788
But this offer is real.
I'm telling you, it's real.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.672
Justin, you're in med school.

04:03.673 --> 04:06.653
It's gonna be years before
you can earn a living.

04:06.654 --> 04:09.318
- Mm, thanks, mom.
- Kevin, you want to be a father.

04:09.319 --> 04:10.651
You've already spent a fortune,

04:10.652 --> 04:12.024
you don't even have the baby yet.

04:12.025 --> 04:15.919
Do you have any idea how much it
costs to raise a child in L.A.?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.322
- Guys, this is a great offer.
- Oh, my God.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.094
Mom, please stop spinning.

04:20.095 --> 04:23.263
I mean, I'm a pundit. I
can smell spin a mile away.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.999
- I'm not spinning. I mean this.
- But?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.101
But nothing.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.337
Nora. Nora, you're not
telling them everything.

04:36.897 --> 04:39.507
Okay, the only thing I haven't told you

04:39.508 --> 04:43.697
is that Obstfeld, the company, is owned
by a guy named Dennis York. That's all.

04:43.698 --> 04:44.998
Dennis York?

04:44.999 --> 04:46.793
- Who's that?
- He used to work for dad.

04:46.794 --> 04:49.763
Yeah. Wow. That's like
calling a whore a date.

04:49.798 --> 04:52.831
Oh, this guy was paid under
the table to do God knows what.

04:52.832 --> 04:54.647
Sarah, you're making him
sound like he was a hit man.

04:54.682 --> 04:57.369
Dennis York was a problem solver, okay?

04:57.370 --> 04:59.138
If there were any union problems,

04:59.173 --> 05:00.704
for example, your father would call him,

05:00.705 --> 05:01.829
and... and they would be resolved.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.272
So does this guy have anything on dad?

05:03.273 --> 05:06.130
- Wait a minute, mom. Is he trying to blackmail you?
- No!

05:06.131 --> 05:08.457
Guys, I think you should just
talk to Holly about Narrow Lake.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.522
Is this another way of
covering something dad did?

05:10.523 --> 05:11.795
Well, what did dad do?

05:11.796 --> 05:14.736
I have put the last five
years of my life into Ojai...

05:14.737 --> 05:17.121
yeah, but, Sarah, if there
are bodies buried somewhere,

05:17.122 --> 05:18.940
- I think it's t...
- It's not about your campaign, Kitty.

05:18.974 --> 05:20.768
Oh, I never said it was about my campaign,

05:20.769 --> 05:23.076
Stop! There is no body buried!

05:23.077 --> 05:27.407
No. Th-this is just an incredible
opportunity for you guys,

05:27.408 --> 05:28.854
and that's why I brought it to you,

05:28.855 --> 05:31.393
so you could all have everything
you want out of your lives.

05:31.394 --> 05:33.836
Look, this is the kind of opportunity

05:33.837 --> 05:37.005
that makes owning a
family business worthwhile.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.709
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry if
I... if I... if I shocked you.

05:39.743 --> 05:42.712
That's why I thought we
should order some food first.

05:42.746 --> 05:44.414
Mom, I don't think food

05:44.448 --> 05:47.017
would have made this go down any easier.

05:47.051 --> 05:50.520
Well, then don't eat anything.
Just don't eat anything.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.610
You were absolutely right.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.918
Bizarro.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.838 --> 06:13.153
I don't understand how your mom

06:13.154 --> 06:15.615
could completely dismiss the
possibility of Narrow Lake.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.011
Because I was the one who said it.

06:17.046 --> 06:19.315
I... I mean, when it comes
to Ojai, I don't count.

06:19.316 --> 06:20.065
And it started with my dad.

06:20.066 --> 06:22.067
He never wanted me around that place.

06:22.101 --> 06:24.069
- I'm just not a part of it.
- Well, I am.

06:24.070 --> 06:25.661
It's where I work, and
it's my mom's company,

06:25.695 --> 06:28.095
and I just gave her all of
that money to invest in it.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.159
Rebecca, she was just throwing
it out there, all right?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.031
It doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.

06:31.032 --> 06:32.518
Yeah, you say that now,
but you know your mom.

06:32.519 --> 06:33.719
She's gonna pressure you into it.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.693
- We're gonna be caught in the middle again.
- No, we won't.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.625
Rebecca, you come first.

06:37.626 --> 06:39.694
You're what's important to me, not Ojai.

06:39.728 --> 06:41.623
So whatever you want me to do, I'll do.

06:41.624 --> 06:43.869
I don't want you to sell.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.663
Then I won't.

06:45.664 --> 06:47.872
And all this family stuff...

06:47.873 --> 06:51.608
I mean, we've been through
too much to let it matter.

06:51.609 --> 06:54.749
I choose you.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.723
I choose you, too.

06:56.724 --> 06:59.743
Come here.

07:02.124 --> 07:04.591
Wow. I feel like we just won the lottery.

07:04.626 --> 07:06.160
Well, we don't know what the offer is yet.

07:06.161 --> 07:08.568
- And I'm not even sure we should take it.
- What?

07:08.569 --> 07:10.364
Do the words "gift horse"
mean anything to you?

07:10.365 --> 07:12.862
Look, Scotty, Ojai's our
family business, okay?

07:12.863 --> 07:14.863
It's always been there.
It's a like safety net,

07:14.898 --> 07:17.566
- and I want that for our kids.
- What kids?

07:17.600 --> 07:20.466
Kevin, right now we have two
frozen blasts and a lot of debt.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.337
We're supposed to be positive, remember?

07:22.338 --> 07:24.722
Okay, I'm so positive.
I'm reading "the secret,"

07:24.723 --> 07:26.042
and I'm putting good
vibes into the universe.

07:26.043 --> 07:27.655
But this is our last chance.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.124
You know, if Monday's transfer
doesn't work, that's it.

07:30.159 --> 07:33.018
W... we're done. $100,000 down the tubes.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.832
That's your version of staying positive?

07:36.101 --> 07:39.305
I just want us to have kids so badly.

07:39.306 --> 07:42.753
And if this doesn't take, we're gonna
have to pay for a whole other round...

07:42.754 --> 07:44.565
look, I would love the cash, okay,

07:44.566 --> 07:47.104
but I'm not gonna sign
anything until I know the facts.

07:47.105 --> 07:49.691
And, you know, there's
something wrong here.

07:49.692 --> 07:51.458
Why would your mother try to cover it up?

07:51.459 --> 07:53.577
I mean, you guys all
know he wasn't exactly

07:53.578 --> 07:55.163
the most upstanding businessman,

07:55.164 --> 07:56.429
and, you know, besides, he's dead.

07:56.430 --> 07:57.936
What if this is about Tommy?

07:57.937 --> 07:59.905
I'm serious. What if he convinced mom

07:59.940 --> 08:01.854
to sell the company so he
could pay off his debts?

08:01.855 --> 08:03.042
Not everything's Tommy's fault.

08:03.077 --> 08:05.630
Well, I kn... you know what?
I'm just not gonna be comfortable

08:05.631 --> 08:09.283
- until we know the truth.
- All right.

08:13.411 --> 08:15.562
To a good transfer.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.810
And an easy thaw.

08:21.086 --> 08:23.387
Ooh, I'm gonna get your little feet.

08:23.422 --> 08:25.389
Do you wanna play peekaboo?

08:25.424 --> 08:28.058
Evan. Where is Evan?

08:28.093 --> 08:29.727
Hey. Peekaboo.

08:29.761 --> 08:31.261
Hey.

08:31.296 --> 08:34.365
- How was dinner?
- Oh, you have no idea.

08:34.399 --> 08:37.034
I was so deluded growing up.

08:37.068 --> 08:40.672
I thought my father was the best
father in the whole entire world.

08:40.673 --> 08:42.620
Now I have no idea what he did,

08:42.621 --> 08:44.126
but I know that it was really bad,

08:44.128 --> 08:47.455
because when I tell you that my
mother is spinning like a top...

08:47.456 --> 08:49.181
did you tell 'em about your appointment?

08:50.184 --> 08:51.477
Honey, you were gonna tell them

08:51.478 --> 08:52.851
about your first-look
appointment with Dr. Avadon.

08:52.852 --> 08:56.073
Yes, I just... I didn't get
a chance. Tommy was there.

08:56.074 --> 08:58.209
And then my mother drops this bombshell,

08:58.243 --> 09:02.012
and she wants everybody
to sell their Ojai shares.

09:02.046 --> 09:05.048
Okay, look, I am not
interested in Ojai right now.

09:05.082 --> 09:06.889
I'm just thinking about
you and this appointment

09:06.890 --> 09:09.639
- and that you're gonna be great.
- Yeah.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.408
- And Evan thinks so, too.
- Yeah. Poor little guy.

09:12.442 --> 09:16.646
He is so high on, uh, children's
ibuprofen and teething gel,

09:16.680 --> 09:20.284
that... that he doesn't know
what's going on. Do you, baby?

09:20.318 --> 09:22.920
Mm. No. He just knows he loves you.

09:25.657 --> 09:29.962
I don't know, you know, I
just keep thinking that...

09:29.996 --> 09:32.811
This is what cancer survivors do.

09:32.812 --> 09:34.844
You know, you go through
your rounds of chemo,

09:34.845 --> 09:37.861
you get a clean bill of health,
and then you go back for a checkup.

09:37.862 --> 09:41.237
You know, it's like... it's
like going to the dentist.

09:41.238 --> 09:44.106
- It doesn't mean that you have a cavity.
- Exactly.

09:44.141 --> 09:46.075
And I'm, uh,

09:46.109 --> 09:49.112
I'm gonna sell my shares.

09:49.146 --> 09:51.214
My... my mother wants that,

09:51.248 --> 09:54.518
and I, you know, I think she's
in some kind of trouble, so...

09:54.552 --> 09:56.253
Hey, look, whatever's right.

09:56.287 --> 09:57.888
Yeah.

10:18.353 --> 10:20.157
Why should we just sit around?

10:23.135 --> 10:24.268
Sarah.

10:24.302 --> 10:26.837
Justin, what are you doing up?

10:26.872 --> 10:28.539
Why is mama yelling?

10:28.573 --> 10:30.675
Oh, mommy isn't yelling.

10:30.709 --> 10:33.844
Mama's just talkin' really loudly.

10:33.879 --> 10:36.915
Come on. Let's go upstairs
and get you back in bed.

10:51.063 --> 10:55.433
Oh, hey. It's me. Are you doing anything?

10:55.468 --> 10:57.006
I couldn't hear what they were saying,

10:57.007 --> 10:59.823
but mom was in the yard
with Dennis and dad.

10:59.824 --> 11:02.125
And... and then she was
yelling. She was angry.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.454
I've never seen her so angry.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.223
I wish I knew what it was, but I don't.

11:06.224 --> 11:09.060
Okay, but how is mom involved in this?

11:09.094 --> 11:12.029
I don't know. I swear
to God, I don't know.

11:12.064 --> 11:14.541
But whatever it is, it
freaked out mom so much,

11:14.542 --> 11:16.491
she hopped a plane to Seattle.

11:16.492 --> 11:18.460
Sarah, I don't know about you,

11:18.494 --> 11:21.206
but I don't want to start
digging up old bones.

11:21.207 --> 11:23.136
So what, we just sell Ojai?

11:23.137 --> 11:27.603
Look, I know that you think saving
the company is saving the family,

11:27.604 --> 11:31.339
but the family will be fine
without it, probably better off.

11:31.374 --> 11:35.277
You need to focus on your life, Sarah.

11:35.311 --> 11:39.915
If mom is right, and
there is an opportunity...

11:53.798 --> 11:55.332
Hello, Nora.

11:59.165 --> 12:00.766
They're not biting.

12:02.469 --> 12:04.937
So what's the game plan?

12:04.971 --> 12:08.177
I brought Tommy down.
I just need more time.

12:08.178 --> 12:11.634
- You have until next week.
- Next week?

12:11.635 --> 12:14.070
I'm losing patience.

12:14.104 --> 12:17.306
I've already wasted enough time
trying to buy Holly's shares.

12:19.476 --> 12:22.344
Oh, Dennis, you know what?

12:22.378 --> 12:23.979
I never trusted you.

12:24.014 --> 12:25.757
I used to say to William,

12:25.758 --> 12:31.052
"there's something off with
that guy. He's dead in the eyes."

12:31.087 --> 12:33.855
You know, I'm getting
a little sick of this.

12:33.889 --> 12:36.244
You insist on making me into this monster,

12:36.245 --> 12:39.628
and we both know I was
just following orders...

12:39.662 --> 12:41.429
William's and yours.

12:44.767 --> 12:48.136
Here.

12:49.538 --> 12:52.541
Proof... copies of canceled checks.

12:52.575 --> 12:56.045
Your signature's on every one.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.022
There's nothing illegal about what we did.

12:58.023 --> 12:59.361
I know.

12:59.362 --> 13:03.320
But it's hardly what your
children expect from you.

13:03.354 --> 13:07.258
Get your kids to sign on the dotted line,

13:07.292 --> 13:11.129
or I swear to God, Nora, I'm
gonna destroy your family.

13:11.163 --> 13:12.664
I have no choice.

13:21.355 --> 13:22.326
Thanks.

13:24.744 --> 13:27.740
So you're actually considering
selling your shares?

13:27.741 --> 13:28.617
I don't know, Holly.

13:28.618 --> 13:30.741
I mean, if my family can make
a lot of money on this now,

13:30.742 --> 13:33.233
and I don't have to deal with
the crap my father left me...

13:33.234 --> 13:36.836
it's not your father's
business any longer. It's ours.

13:36.837 --> 13:38.968
Well, maybe I'm just not up
for the challenge anymore.

13:38.969 --> 13:41.370
If it's not the economy, it's some scandal

13:41.438 --> 13:43.338
or... or secret that gets
dredged up from the past,

13:43.373 --> 13:44.840
like this Narrow Lake.

13:44.874 --> 13:47.108
What's with that? Why
didn't you come to me?

13:47.143 --> 13:50.012
Because your mother asked me not to.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.034
Why would she do that?

13:51.035 --> 13:53.416
- She's convinced there's nothing there.
- Nothing there?

13:53.450 --> 13:56.853
I found a geological survey
that your father did in '73

13:56.888 --> 13:59.657
on this piece of property
called Narrow Lake.

13:59.691 --> 14:03.628
A month ago, Dennis York
filed a "doing business as"

14:03.662 --> 14:05.931
under the same name.

14:05.965 --> 14:07.432
He did?

14:07.467 --> 14:09.868
Yes. Obviously, this
is complicated for you.

14:09.902 --> 14:12.671
You've got a lot of
family issues to consider.

14:12.705 --> 14:15.641
But bottom line... this is business.

14:15.675 --> 14:18.643
And you and I have been
working our asses off

14:18.678 --> 14:20.144
to save this place.

14:20.179 --> 14:23.114
And God knows I need the
money more than anyone.

14:23.149 --> 14:26.184
My... my personal assets
have been wiped out.

14:26.218 --> 14:29.859
But God, Sarah, look
around. Look at this place.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.327
It's incredible.

14:31.362 --> 14:35.099
And we could make this
a great business again.

14:35.133 --> 14:36.084
I mean, we have come this far.

14:36.085 --> 14:38.778
What are you gonna do, huh, just give up?

14:38.779 --> 14:40.748
Well, I wouldn't be giving it up.

14:40.782 --> 14:43.818
I'd... I'd... I'd be moving on.

14:43.853 --> 14:47.423
As long as you can live with that.

14:59.561 --> 15:00.379
Hey.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.110
Hi, honey.

15:03.128 --> 15:04.595
Thank you for stopping by.

15:04.629 --> 15:07.398
I... I wanted to talk
to you after last night.

15:07.432 --> 15:09.367
Uh, me, too.

15:09.401 --> 15:11.569
Sarah, I... I want you to know

15:11.604 --> 15:14.806
that this is... this is
completely your decision.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.842
Oh, good. I'm glad that you think so.

15:16.876 --> 15:19.595
And I'm sorry how I acted last night.

15:19.596 --> 15:21.097
This isn't easy for anyone.

15:21.098 --> 15:24.501
I know how hard it would
be for you to walk away.

15:24.536 --> 15:28.564
Good. Because I thought about
it, mom. I... I really did,

15:28.565 --> 15:31.500
- and I talked to Tommy.
- I know. He told me.

15:31.534 --> 15:34.302
What he said made a lot of sense,

15:34.337 --> 15:36.404
but then I just talked to Holly.

15:36.439 --> 15:37.906
To Holly?

15:37.940 --> 15:39.774
Well, she is my business partner, mom.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.744
Well, I know she is, sweetheart,
but Holly has her own agenda,

15:42.778 --> 15:45.713
and I think maybe she would
manipulate you in such a way

15:45.748 --> 15:48.282
to service that agenda...
that stupid Narrow Lake thing.

15:48.317 --> 15:51.519
Yeah, but it's not... it's
not really stupid, is it, mom?

15:51.553 --> 15:52.864
There's some pretty compelling evidence

15:52.865 --> 15:54.278
that there's something...

15:55.557 --> 15:57.257
- Hey.
- Hello.

15:57.292 --> 15:58.859
Hey.

15:58.894 --> 16:01.595
- Oh, are we talking about Ojai?
- Yeah.

16:01.629 --> 16:03.856
Evidently, our friend Holly is trying

16:03.857 --> 16:06.534
- to convince your sister not to sell.
- No mom.

16:06.568 --> 16:09.404
I actually thought it through
myself, very carefully.

16:09.438 --> 16:11.373
I've just realized that I can't sell Ojai

16:11.407 --> 16:13.375
until it's back to what it was.

16:13.409 --> 16:15.460
Otherwise it's gonna feel
like an enormous failure.

16:15.461 --> 16:16.785
Is this about your pride now?

16:16.786 --> 16:18.787
What am I supposed to say
in a job interview, mom?

16:18.788 --> 16:21.287
That I took my father's company,
that I drove it into the ground

16:21.288 --> 16:24.190
and then I walked away because
somebody made me a nice offer

16:24.224 --> 16:25.297
and it was the easiest thing to do?

16:25.298 --> 16:26.766
You can't ask me to do that.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.913
But this is a family business, honey.

16:28.914 --> 16:31.395
It's a family business.
Everybody has a vote.

16:31.396 --> 16:32.781
What about you, Kitty?

16:32.782 --> 16:34.960
You're being
uncharacteristically quiet here.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.511
Yeah, come on, Kitty.
My career is on the line.

16:36.545 --> 16:39.149
No, Sarah. That's not fair.

16:39.150 --> 16:41.699
Please just let Kitty
make her own decisions.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.762
Okay, I... I think, you know,

16:42.796 --> 16:45.531
coming from somebody who is
less emotionally entangled in...

16:45.566 --> 16:49.135
I'm not emotionally entangled, Kitty.

16:49.136 --> 16:50.727
I'm co-president.

16:50.728 --> 16:53.864
Okay. Okay, Sarah, all
I am saying is that...

16:53.898 --> 16:54.947
that you're on mom's side.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.382
No, I'm not taking anybody's side, Sarah.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.589
- It's not about sides.
- Well,

16:57.590 --> 16:59.337
I'm not selling, and
I'm gonna make damn sure

16:59.338 --> 17:00.733
that nobody else can either.

17:00.734 --> 17:01.877
Kitty, you're not selling.

17:01.878 --> 17:03.986
Stop it! God, Sarah, stop it.

17:03.987 --> 17:05.487
Don't bully your sister.

17:05.521 --> 17:08.457
God, when is the last time I
ever asked you for anything?

17:08.491 --> 17:10.959
Never. And I'm always there
for you, whatever you want.

17:10.992 --> 17:13.829
If you need me to babysit
or carpool your kids

17:13.863 --> 17:15.775
of make you a dinner or be
a shoulder for you to cry on,

17:15.776 --> 17:17.568
- I'm there.
- Oh, so that's it? The bill's due now?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.803
Instead of 13 bucks an
hour, you want my career?

17:19.837 --> 17:22.743
This isn't a career.
It's a job. It's a job.

17:22.744 --> 17:25.348
And I don't care what you say.
You're smart. You're talented.

17:25.382 --> 17:27.349
You could get a job anywhere.

17:27.384 --> 17:30.320
Do you think I would ask
you to do something like this

17:30.354 --> 17:32.222
if I didn't need to?

17:32.256 --> 17:34.191
My God, Sarah, I'm always there for you.

17:34.225 --> 17:36.727
I come through for you every
time, no questions asked.

17:36.762 --> 17:38.696
And just this once, this one time,

17:38.731 --> 17:41.734
why can't you do the same for me?

17:52.646 --> 17:54.614
We got it. Let's go.

17:54.648 --> 17:56.115
Is he stable?

18:00.906 --> 18:02.673
Dennis?

18:04.476 --> 18:06.377
Mom.

18:07.779 --> 18:08.531
Mom.

18:08.532 --> 18:12.001
Get in the car, Tommy.

18:12.035 --> 18:14.769
I said get in the car.

18:26.401 --> 18:28.878
They, uh, they both just left.

18:28.879 --> 18:30.449
They seem pretty upset.

18:30.450 --> 18:31.848
Tommy, Sarah's not gonna do it.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.582
Sarah's not gonna do it.

18:34.583 --> 18:38.530
Mom... what is going on?

18:38.531 --> 18:38.755
If this were just about dad,

18:38.789 --> 18:41.624
you wouldn't be doing all this stuff.

18:41.659 --> 18:44.927
Look, you brought me down here, mom. What?

18:45.686 --> 18:47.352
What is it?

18:51.624 --> 18:55.194
I met with York again last night.

18:55.228 --> 18:57.262
He gave me these.

19:15.286 --> 19:18.255
I know your father told you
everything was all right.

19:19.924 --> 19:21.891
Oh, my God.

19:21.926 --> 19:25.294
But it wasn't all right.

19:25.328 --> 19:28.364
Have you been paying off the family?

19:28.398 --> 19:30.800
Yes.

19:30.835 --> 19:32.702
No.

19:32.737 --> 19:36.173
Mom, what, a-and you lied to me?

19:36.207 --> 19:39.910
For 25 years, you lied?!

19:39.944 --> 19:43.081
He... he's hurt?

19:43.115 --> 19:45.083
How bad?

19:47.987 --> 19:50.322
Mom?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.858
How bad?!

19:56.995 --> 19:59.063
He was paralyzed.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.033
- He was paralyzed.
- Oh, God.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.935
Oh, God. It was an accident, Tommy.

20:04.969 --> 20:07.938
- Mom...
- Your father made a deal with the family.

20:07.972 --> 20:09.940
He sent them money every month,

20:09.974 --> 20:12.943
and then when he died...
I continued to do it.

20:12.978 --> 20:16.280
- No.
- It was a very long time ago.

20:16.315 --> 20:19.284
You were all just kids.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.321
And at the time...

20:22.388 --> 20:25.558
I thought we were doing the right thing.

20:33.905 --> 20:35.176
What do you mean, she flipped out?

20:35.177 --> 20:37.641
Okay, there are two
kinds of flip outs, right?

20:37.642 --> 20:39.781
There's the "oh, my God.
You all aren't coming over

20:39.782 --> 20:41.073
on Thanksgiving dinner?" Flip out,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.021
and then there's the "oh, my God.

20:43.022 --> 20:44.440
"My husband has been cheating on me

20:44.502 --> 20:46.796
for the entire duration
of my marriage" flip out.

20:46.797 --> 20:48.493
And it was definitely the latter.

20:48.494 --> 20:51.475
And all I said was that I
didn't want to sell the company.

20:51.476 --> 20:52.969
Yeah, and it's not even
like I agreed with you.

20:52.970 --> 20:54.875
Yeah, you made your feelings
about that pretty clear, Kitty.

20:54.876 --> 20:56.302
I don't think we should do anything

20:56.303 --> 20:58.392
- until we know exactly what's going on.
-Thank you.

20:58.393 --> 21:01.431
What happens if dad actually
did something really bad?

21:01.432 --> 21:02.940
What if it's Tommy?

21:03.168 --> 21:06.103
He's already broken the
law once... that we know of.

21:06.704 --> 21:08.658
Look, this is probably
nothing, but I keep...

21:08.659 --> 21:10.730
I keep going back to this memory I had.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.010
Mom's yelling at York in the backyard.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.496
Oh, my God. I remember that.

21:15.497 --> 21:18.073
- It was the night that you got me drunk.
- I got you drunk?

21:18.074 --> 21:19.849
Yes, you did. You got me drunk.

21:20.426 --> 21:22.599
Oh, my God. Sarah, don't you remember?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.467
Sarah?!

21:23.468 --> 21:25.044
What, Kitty? I'm right here.

21:25.682 --> 21:26.986
Oh, hi.

21:33.173 --> 21:34.545
Who is mom yelling at now?

21:34.546 --> 21:36.952
It's, uh, dad and this guy Dennis.

21:36.953 --> 21:38.881
Did he throw up on mom's sofa, too?

21:38.882 --> 21:41.015
Oh. Here.

21:41.016 --> 21:42.650
This will help settle your stomach.

21:42.651 --> 21:44.379
Okay. Thanks.

21:47.903 --> 21:49.046
Sarah.

21:49.565 --> 21:51.757
Oh, Justin. What are you doing up?

21:52.688 --> 21:54.321
Why is mama yelling?

21:54.322 --> 21:55.309
Oh, mommy's not yelling.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.482
That was the night that I
vowed I would never drink again.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.667
- Whew.
- That lasted.

21:58.668 --> 22:02.068
- Yeah.
- Well, at least I don't drink wine coolers anymore.

22:02.635 --> 22:04.300
What was mom yelling about?

22:04.301 --> 22:04.933
I don't know.

22:04.934 --> 22:06.129
I couldn't hear through the window.

22:06.130 --> 22:07.049
Wait a minute.

22:07.050 --> 22:09.825
That was the night that you
had that big party at Ojai.

22:09.826 --> 22:12.650
Oh, my God. I did.

22:12.651 --> 22:15.547
- Yeah.
- Was that when I was dating Patrick Shuman?

22:16.258 --> 22:18.596
No. No, you definitely weren't dating him.

22:18.597 --> 22:19.670
But he... he was there.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.821
- I never got invited to anything.
- Oh, no, you were there.

22:22.822 --> 22:25.364
You turned up with Tommy
and crashed my party.

22:30.737 --> 22:31.519
We do, Patrick.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.902
We lose Nicaragua, there
goes central America.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.619
Next thing you know, we got the soviets

22:35.620 --> 22:37.432
positioning missiles in our backyard.

22:37.433 --> 22:40.614
Okay, Kitty. He gets enough
poli-sci lectures in school.

22:40.615 --> 22:43.087
No, it's rad. I rarely
meet other Republicans.

22:43.088 --> 22:44.831
You're a Republican?

22:44.832 --> 22:46.728
See? I told you I wasn't the only one.

22:48.618 --> 22:52.442
* We were so in phase *

22:52.550 --> 22:53.154
Here, Kitty.

22:53.155 --> 22:54.538
Oh, I don't really drink.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.101
Oh, stop being such a geek.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.188
Oh, look what just walked in.

23:02.189 --> 23:03.925
Hey, Sarah. Kit.

23:03.926 --> 23:05.089
What are you doing here?

23:05.090 --> 23:06.926
Oh, he's showing off his new car.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.023
Ah, you're just jealous. Where's the keg?

23:09.024 --> 23:11.084
Tommy, this is a college party.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.250
Kitty's not in college.

23:12.251 --> 23:16.027
Yeah, but she's a girl. At any party with
college guys, high school girls are invited.

23:16.028 --> 23:19.159
And all of my classes are A.P,
which is basically college.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.111
Well, this is basically where I work.

23:22.112 --> 23:25.580
So as a responsible employee,
I might have to call dad,

23:25.581 --> 23:26.731
tell him his oldest daughter

23:26.732 --> 23:28.460
is throwing a kegger at his office.

23:31.570 --> 23:34.267
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Did you bring Kevin?

23:34.268 --> 23:35.756
Oh, hi, Sarah.

23:37.085 --> 23:38.276
I love this song.

23:41.121 --> 23:42.801
What are you doing here?

23:42.802 --> 23:45.120
- I brought him.
- Oh, cool. Thanks a lot.

23:45.645 --> 23:47.329
I thought high school
girls were always allowed.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.997
Yeah, his I.Q. is very low.

23:50.177 --> 23:52.311
It's hard for him to distinguish genders.

23:53.278 --> 23:55.486
Oh, guys. This is, uh, this is Aaron.

23:55.487 --> 23:57.105
- He's from Sharon.
- Hey.

23:57.205 --> 23:58.739
Oh, my God. That rhymes.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.029
I'm just down here for the weekend.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.240
- There's a state swim meet.
- Yeah,

24:01.241 --> 24:02.829
yeah. He's one of the best divers in Cali.

24:03.566 --> 24:06.270
Oh, my God. What did Kitty do to her hair?

24:06.532 --> 24:07.618
I love it!

24:14.242 --> 24:16.724
Oh, my God, Kevin. Remember
that boy that you brought?

24:17.686 --> 24:18.901
Who, Aaron?

24:18.902 --> 24:21.901
Yeah. Yeah, well, I used
to see him at swim meets.

24:21.902 --> 24:22.602
He lived up north.

24:22.603 --> 24:24.485
Yeah, you were totally
into him, weren't you?

24:25.568 --> 24:26.851
Wouldn't have mattered. I wasn't out then.

24:26.852 --> 24:29.273
Oh, you never fooled around?
Not even a little bit?

24:29.274 --> 24:31.271
Actually, we had a fight that night.

24:31.272 --> 24:32.243
What about?

24:32.987 --> 24:35.002
I don't remember. That was 25 years ago.

24:35.003 --> 24:36.435
We were drinking wine coolers.

24:36.436 --> 24:37.994
Well, I thought he was very cute.

24:37.995 --> 24:40.566
- You thought everyone was cute that night, didn't you?
- Oh, I did not.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.984
I'm just gonna ask you
this one time, Kitty.

24:42.985 --> 24:45.520
Did you sleep with Patrick Shuman?

24:45.521 --> 24:46.829
- No, I didn't...
- 'Cause you know he was my boyfriend.

24:46.830 --> 24:48.615
No, Sarah,

24:48.616 --> 24:50.869
I was a virgin, and you never
told me he was your boyfriend.

24:50.870 --> 24:53.843
I bet the only reason you didn't
was because the party busted up.

24:53.844 --> 24:57.148
- Wait. What... what happened? Did the police come?
- No.

24:59.105 --> 25:00.139
It was Tommy.

25:02.872 --> 25:06.519
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
No body parts on the copier.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.368
Yo, Sarah. Your brother's on the phone.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.403
Patrick!

25:14.353 --> 25:17.334
Uh, hello. You what?

25:17.335 --> 25:18.592
Are you okay?

25:20.910 --> 25:22.557
Why did you do that?

25:24.003 --> 25:25.994
Okay. Okay, okay.

25:26.466 --> 25:29.146
- What happened?
- Uh, Tommy's been in an accident.

25:29.147 --> 25:30.539
He's on his way to the hospital.

25:30.540 --> 25:31.649
Oh, was he hurt badly?

25:31.650 --> 25:33.177
I don't know. He's with the paramedics.

25:33.178 --> 25:34.936
But he told dad that
we're hanging out here.

25:34.937 --> 25:37.168
We have to clean up this party
right now. Dad's on the way.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.846
That's right. He
totaled his brand-new car

25:38.847 --> 25:41.334
and he ruined the party. It's so Tommy.

25:41.512 --> 25:43.655
- Oh, my God.
- What?

25:44.332 --> 25:46.222
I remember this now.

25:46.758 --> 25:48.389
- Okay, don't freak out.
- What?

25:49.908 --> 25:51.652
He wasn't the only one in the car.

25:58.497 --> 25:59.455
Where you going?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.277
To get more beer.

26:01.278 --> 26:04.148
- Tommy, you're drunk.
- I had two drinks.

26:04.149 --> 26:06.106
And the liquor store is,
like, three blocks away.

26:06.107 --> 26:07.705
That's what the kids in the
film at school always say

26:07.706 --> 26:09.688
just before they drive into a semi.

26:09.689 --> 26:11.307
You are such a pain.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.576
You're like an ad for M.A.D.D.

26:12.577 --> 26:14.336
See? Tommy, you're drunk.

26:14.337 --> 26:16.215
You're rhyming and you
don't even realize it.

26:17.544 --> 26:20.823
Look, you need to stop
worrying about me, Kevin,

26:20.824 --> 26:22.338
and start worrying about yourself.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.303
Okay? I mean, look at
you. You have no friends.

26:25.828 --> 26:27.216
And the only reason
Aaron's hanging out with you

26:27.217 --> 26:28.990
is because he's from a
different high school.

26:28.991 --> 26:30.798
He's from a different city.

26:46.286 --> 26:47.276
Look...

26:48.473 --> 26:51.393
Kev... I'm sorry.

26:52.509 --> 26:55.121
I'll pick you up some
grape Hubba Bubba and...

26:55.610 --> 26:58.393
Hey, I told you I'd take you
to see "Platoon" this weekend,

26:58.394 --> 26:59.722
and I will.

27:00.398 --> 27:01.430
Hey.

27:01.431 --> 27:03.952
Um, I'd... I'd rather see "Top Gun" again.

27:04.568 --> 27:07.006
Okay. "Top Gun" it is.

27:08.349 --> 27:09.141
Hey.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.465
And Tommy was drunk? You're sure?

27:31.826 --> 27:33.728
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.

27:38.653 --> 27:40.390
Well, who was the other kid in the car?

27:40.391 --> 27:42.363
I don't know. Tommy had tons of friends.

27:42.364 --> 27:43.994
Okay, l... listen,

27:43.995 --> 27:46.050
let's just step back from
the edge here for a second.

27:46.051 --> 27:48.432
Are we honestly thinking that Tommy...

27:48.433 --> 27:50.558
- Oh, God. It's him.
- What do we do?

27:50.559 --> 27:52.042
Uh, we just act casual.

27:52.043 --> 27:53.526
Hey, Kev. Scotty said you'd be here.

27:53.527 --> 27:55.454
Uh, yeah. Actually, we
were just talking about you.

27:55.455 --> 27:57.567
Yeah. Just, you know, old times.

27:57.568 --> 27:58.584
Reminiscing.

28:02.090 --> 28:04.090
Actually, Tommy, you know, um...

28:04.911 --> 28:09.340
We figured out, that... that memory
I told you about, with mom yelling?

28:10.474 --> 28:12.377
Turns out that that was the same night

28:12.378 --> 28:14.107
that I threw the party at Ojai.

28:14.108 --> 28:15.536
What party?

28:15.537 --> 28:19.104
You, um, you had just
gotten your first car.

28:20.227 --> 28:22.746
So? That was 25 years ago.

28:22.747 --> 28:23.874
Who cares?

28:24.653 --> 28:27.516
Well, if I remember, you actually
totaled that car that night.

28:29.913 --> 28:31.344
I can't believe this.

28:31.345 --> 28:33.812
Tommy, we're just trying to
figure out this whole York thing.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.254
Yeah, right. You think I
did something, don't you?

28:36.255 --> 28:38.838
There was another kid in the
car with you that night, right?

28:40.369 --> 28:43.567
Kevin... do not blame me for this.

28:43.568 --> 28:45.376
Oh, Tommy. Nobody's trying to blame you.

28:45.377 --> 28:46.213
We're really... we're just trying

28:46.214 --> 28:47.399
- to figure it out.
- You guys, I'm warning you.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.912
- Just drop it. Okay?
- Tommy...

28:48.913 --> 28:51.345
What? I'm outta here.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.630
Tommy. I'm not talking about this, Kevin.

28:56.631 --> 28:57.696
Who was in the car? Did you hurt him?

28:57.697 --> 28:58.627
Oh, unbelievable.

28:58.628 --> 29:00.453
Is mom covering for you? Is
that what this is all about?

29:00.454 --> 29:02.353
York's found out, now
mom's covering for you?

29:02.354 --> 29:04.590
Why is it the first thing
you want to do is blame me?

29:04.591 --> 29:06.234
I'm trying to help
you, but I can't do that

29:06.235 --> 29:07.253
- unless I know the truth.
- Oh,

29:07.254 --> 29:08.961
you think you have the
whole thing figured out,

29:08.962 --> 29:10.013
- don't you, Kevin?
- Tommy,

29:10.014 --> 29:13.200
I was th... I... I begged
you not to get in that car.

29:13.201 --> 29:15.380
Please, just please, let me help you.

29:16.787 --> 29:17.892
You know what? ! You're on your own.

29:17.893 --> 29:19.934
You always do that.

29:19.935 --> 29:21.542
You always run away from your problems.

29:21.543 --> 29:23.293
You know what? You can't do it forever.

29:23.473 --> 29:24.748
One day, you're gonna
have to face yourself

29:24.749 --> 29:26.414
and you'll be alone when you do.

29:39.248 --> 29:41.239
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:41.722 --> 29:43.877
Are you looking for the kappa house

29:43.878 --> 29:46.503
or are you just gonna go ahead
and roll on into first period?

29:47.849 --> 29:48.750
How's Evan?

29:48.751 --> 29:50.533
He's good. He's with Mary at the park.

29:50.534 --> 29:52.581
What... what happened last night?

29:52.582 --> 29:54.721
Oh, my God, Robert. It's so bad.

29:55.284 --> 29:57.714
Tommy apparently was in a car accident

29:57.715 --> 29:59.585
when he was, like, 16 years old,

29:59.586 --> 30:03.924
and we think that he hurt
somebody or worse, and...

30:03.925 --> 30:06.550
we're starting to think that
that's what York has on mom.

30:06.551 --> 30:08.900
And... and now Saul has
called us back to the house

30:08.901 --> 30:09.970
for this... this big... Kitty,

30:09.971 --> 30:12.348
Kitty, listen, I know about the accident.

30:13.858 --> 30:14.622
What?

30:14.623 --> 30:15.956
Well, yeah. I know about the accident

30:15.957 --> 30:18.991
like I know that Kevin
was late on his '02 taxes

30:18.992 --> 30:21.938
and that Sarah had a housekeeper
for a summer that wasn't a citizen.

30:21.939 --> 30:24.610
Oh, my God. Of course. You
ran for president, so...

30:24.611 --> 30:27.147
yeah, I mean, they vetted my
seventh grade math teacher.

30:28.081 --> 30:29.137
Okay.

30:31.042 --> 30:32.225
So tell me what you know.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.095
I'm sorry to have you
all come over here again.

30:36.096 --> 30:38.386
Well, it's not like we've
been thinking about much else.

30:38.387 --> 30:39.938
Um, I have to meet Scotty soon,

30:39.939 --> 30:41.745
so can you say what you want to say?

30:43.734 --> 30:46.572
I know it's hard, what your
mother's asking us to do.

30:47.341 --> 30:49.577
I've been at Ojai longer than any of you.

30:49.578 --> 30:50.675
So you want to sell?

30:50.842 --> 30:52.244
Sarah, please let him finish.

30:52.245 --> 30:53.745
Well, it doesn't make sense, mom.

30:53.746 --> 30:55.834
- It makes all the sense in the world, Kevin.
- Why?

30:57.158 --> 30:58.833
All I need to know is
that she wants to do it.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.244
I don't give a damn why.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.244
Your father was involved
in a lot of things.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.261
And if she wants to clear his name,

31:06.262 --> 31:07.391
whatever is left of it,

31:07.392 --> 31:08.586
why won't you let her?

31:08.587 --> 31:10.724
I don't think it's his
name she's trying to save.

31:12.464 --> 31:14.956
Mom, I love you more than
anything in the world,

31:14.957 --> 31:17.669
- but you gotta tell us what the hell is going on.
- Yeah.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.141
Mom, Sarah's right.

31:20.666 --> 31:22.375
It's over, mom. I can't keep doing this.

31:22.376 --> 31:24.390
You... you... you have
to tell him the truth.

31:24.391 --> 31:25.967
I'm... I'm sorry. "Him"?

31:26.881 --> 31:28.866
Who do you have to tell the truth to?

31:30.248 --> 31:31.912
It's Kitty. Yeah.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.561
Robert knows all about Tommy's accident.

31:34.562 --> 31:37.368
It was nothing. Nobody was seriously hurt.

31:38.470 --> 31:39.894
What are you talking about?

31:40.432 --> 31:42.006
Well, our whole family was investigated

31:42.007 --> 31:43.657
when Robert ran for president,

31:43.658 --> 31:45.259
and the kid who was in the car with Tommy,

31:45.260 --> 31:46.765
he's a teacher up in Santa Cruz now.

31:46.766 --> 31:49.886
He's fine. Tommy wasn't
the one who did anything.

31:51.888 --> 31:52.996
Hello?

31:54.321 --> 31:55.431
Kevin?

31:59.011 --> 32:01.698
It wasn't Tommy that hurt
a boy that night, was it?

32:09.035 --> 32:09.774
No.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.168
Uh... where did everybody go?

32:35.169 --> 32:35.988
I don't know,

32:35.989 --> 32:38.437
but it looks like they left in a hurry.

32:38.438 --> 32:39.803
Yeah, it must have happened fast,

32:39.804 --> 32:41.732
'cause we weren't in
the warehouse that long.

32:41.968 --> 32:44.608
Yeah, we kinda were.

32:44.609 --> 32:47.278
Oh, God. Look, I'm so sorry.

32:47.279 --> 32:49.290
I mean, I probably didn't have to show you

32:49.291 --> 32:51.427
how they package every kind of produce.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.340
No, it was cool.

32:54.079 --> 32:57.720
Yeah, uh, but... you know,

32:57.721 --> 32:59.410
what... what... what about a ride home?

32:59.411 --> 33:00.986
How... how are we gonna get there?

33:01.872 --> 33:04.251
I don't know, but I'm not in any rush.

33:05.092 --> 33:07.604
And hey, we even got refreshments.

33:10.038 --> 33:10.857
Yeah.

33:24.908 --> 33:26.081
It's nice out here.

33:27.295 --> 33:28.237
Yeah.

33:31.528 --> 33:33.214
Did I hear something?

33:35.322 --> 33:36.465
I think everybody left.

33:38.927 --> 33:40.270
It's okay.

33:41.181 --> 33:42.766
I didn't hear a thing.

33:50.928 --> 33:52.158
What the hell was that?

34:19.395 --> 34:22.270
Kevin! Get in the car.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.453
Dad... I, uh...

34:24.454 --> 34:25.684
Get in the car now!

34:26.554 --> 34:28.210
I didn't... didn't mean to.

34:28.317 --> 34:29.364
I didn't mean to.

34:30.222 --> 34:30.967
I'm sorry.

34:43.007 --> 34:44.054
Hey, Kev.

34:46.993 --> 34:48.246
I thought you might be here.

34:50.085 --> 34:50.893
Why?

34:55.658 --> 34:57.717
I asked you a question.
How'd you know I was here?

34:57.920 --> 34:59.013
Just go talk to mom.

34:59.801 --> 35:00.916
This is about Aaron, isn't it?

35:00.917 --> 35:03.971
Look, let me just take you
home, you can talk to mom...

35:03.972 --> 35:07.444
no, because you're here
and you know something.

35:15.423 --> 35:16.717
There was a fight, right?

35:16.718 --> 35:19.456
Yeah, and dad told me he was fine.

35:19.457 --> 35:22.103
So why don't you tell me what happened?

35:22.668 --> 35:26.147
Look, all I know is, after
my accident, I called mom.

35:26.148 --> 35:27.859
- Yeah.
- Dad picked up the phone.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.571
I told him we were at Ojai hanging out.

35:30.572 --> 35:32.540
I guess he must have come down here

35:32.541 --> 35:34.198
to see what was going on.

35:35.513 --> 35:37.660
And then when I was
leaving the hospital...

35:40.436 --> 35:41.506
I saw Aaron.

35:44.579 --> 35:46.314
He was on a... a gurney.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.134
They were rushing him in.

35:50.908 --> 35:52.585
And Dennis York was there, too.

35:55.073 --> 35:57.999
Tommy, if you know what happened to Aaron,

35:58.567 --> 36:00.374
you have to tell me now.

36:03.410 --> 36:05.397
He was paralyzed.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.670
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

36:14.763 --> 36:16.921
You... you knew all this time?

36:16.922 --> 36:18.899
No, no, no, no, no. Mom just told me.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.979
I mean, that night, they...
they said he was fine.

36:21.293 --> 36:23.650
I swear. I thought that was the truth.

36:24.179 --> 36:25.200
Kevin...

36:26.465 --> 36:28.432
Kevin, this is not your fault.

36:28.885 --> 36:30.107
It's okay.

36:31.591 --> 36:34.024
No, Tommy, this is not okay.

36:35.409 --> 36:36.599
This is not okay.

36:44.511 --> 36:46.629
I can't just stand here and do nothing.

36:48.717 --> 36:50.140
I don't know what to say, mom.

36:55.587 --> 36:56.851
I wanted to protect him.

36:56.852 --> 36:59.652
I thought of him differently
than I thought of you.

37:02.762 --> 37:03.592
Hello.

37:05.089 --> 37:05.869
Yeah.

37:19.465 --> 37:20.895
I... I told him, mom.

37:21.681 --> 37:22.688
I had to.

37:23.790 --> 37:24.589
Okay.

37:39.915 --> 37:41.080
What have I done?

37:43.947 --> 37:45.522
It was an accident.

37:45.523 --> 37:46.544
He was a swimmer.

37:47.011 --> 37:48.015
Did you know that?

37:49.788 --> 37:51.435
You didn't mean to hurt him.

37:55.034 --> 37:57.661
What did dad tell you he saw that night?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.730
A fight. Just... just a fight.

37:59.731 --> 38:03.576
Two... teenage kids stupidly
swinging at each other,

38:03.577 --> 38:05.824
and then Aaron stumbled off the platform.

38:07.756 --> 38:09.877
That's all he saw, us fighting?

38:10.923 --> 38:14.226
Yes. When he got home, he told
me your friend had been hurt.

38:14.227 --> 38:15.954
He'd fallen off the platform.

38:15.955 --> 38:17.946
He... he didn't know how badly at first.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.274
He told me he called York,

38:19.275 --> 38:23.332
and it was York that went
with Aaron to the hospital.

38:27.974 --> 38:31.146
Why did you tell me he
was fine when he wasn't?

38:35.198 --> 38:37.387
I... I wanted to protect you.

38:37.623 --> 38:41.866
You were a sweet,
insecure 14-year-old boy.

38:45.232 --> 38:50.332
I w... I was afraid that it
would destroy you. And I...

38:50.421 --> 38:52.115
I'm a 38-year-old man.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.146
I know.

38:55.992 --> 38:58.118
There was never a right time.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.097
You were struggling to come out,

39:00.098 --> 39:01.819
- and then law school...
- Law school?

39:01.820 --> 39:04.698
When was the right
time for me to tell you?

39:04.699 --> 39:07.248
And the longer I waited,
the harder it got.

39:07.249 --> 39:08.657
Did dad pay them off?

39:11.843 --> 39:13.232
Yes.

39:14.972 --> 39:16.452
But the family agreed.

39:17.324 --> 39:19.240
No one... was pressured...

39:19.241 --> 39:21.421
I didn't know, mom!

39:22.076 --> 39:23.499
I didn't know.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.883
I know.

39:28.055 --> 39:29.361
I know.

39:32.262 --> 39:33.973
I wanted to protect you.

39:35.157 --> 39:37.900
I thought that's what
parents were supposed to do.

39:40.853 --> 39:42.698
I don't need protecting.

39:45.964 --> 39:48.913
Everything you've said,
it's all about you...

39:49.634 --> 39:52.100
what you wanted to do, how you felt,

39:52.101 --> 39:53.778
how you were gonna protect me.

39:55.241 --> 39:57.474
You were only protecting yourself.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.449
Kevin.

39:59.450 --> 40:01.653
Do not follow me!

40:04.452 --> 40:05.987
Okay.

40:06.483 --> 40:07.674
Okay.

40:26.269 --> 40:27.932
Come on, Tommy. Let me sign your cast.

40:27.933 --> 40:28.702
Don't let her do it, man.

40:28.703 --> 40:29.916
She's gonna write "Reagan rocks."

40:29.917 --> 40:32.772
I don't care what it says.
Nobody's gonna see it anyway.

40:32.773 --> 40:33.774
I'm grounded forever.

40:33.775 --> 40:35.085
Well, it serves you right.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.464
I guess that means no "Top Gun," right?

40:37.726 --> 40:38.559
You, too.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.485
Hey. You guys both
totally ruined that party.

40:40.486 --> 40:42.948
Why do you always hit me?

40:45.292 --> 40:46.281
Mom.

40:47.599 --> 40:49.939
Is... is everything okay?

40:50.670 --> 40:52.740
I remember when they
all got home that night.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.550
Kevin asked me if
everything was gonna be okay.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.880
God, I wish it had been.

41:06.820 --> 41:09.440
Oh, William... damn you.

41:09.820 --> 41:11.338
If you hadn't bought that lake,

41:11.339 --> 41:13.500
none of them would've
found out about any of this.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.710
Now I don't know if
he'll ever forgive me...

41:18.940 --> 41:20.150
If any of them will.

41:20.330 --> 41:22.390
And I don't know why I'm
standing here talking to you.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.960
I hate you, William.

41:26.270 --> 41:28.360
I hate how much you hurt this family.

41:30.050 --> 41:31.530
But I'm gonna repair this

41:31.720 --> 41:32.850
if it's the last thing I ever do.

41:35.770 --> 41:39.950
And then I am never
coming back here again.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.410
After all the things
we found out about dad,

41:47.570 --> 41:50.490
the one thing that I always
knew I could count on was mom.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.190
Now I'm not so sure.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.010
Are you okay?

41:58.500 --> 42:01.440
Uh, no. No. Actually, I'm not.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.890
I... I have to go in for
my first look on Monday.

42:05.850 --> 42:06.800
Oh, God. Do you?

42:07.030 --> 42:08.230
Uh, yeah, I do.

42:11.150 --> 42:13.420
Your cancer's not coming
back, Kitty. I promise.

42:13.610 --> 42:15.570
Oh, you know what, Sarah?
Please don't say that.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.430
I mean, you can't promise me anything.

42:17.431 --> 42:20.880
You don't know anything.
Nobody can promise me anything.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.870
And... and I just... I hate
it when people say that.

42:25.090 --> 42:26.280
You're right.

42:26.740 --> 42:28.240
And I'm sorry. I'm...

42:29.120 --> 42:32.520
I don't know. I'm just, um, I'm...

42:33.310 --> 42:34.420
I'm scared.

42:36.370 --> 42:38.390
Kitty, you're right. I
can't promise you anything,

42:39.100 --> 42:40.150
except this one thing...

42:40.330 --> 42:42.200
that I will always be there for you.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.370
Good. Good.

42:47.530 --> 42:51.040
'Cause you need to, uh, finish the dishes.

42:51.880 --> 42:52.950
Mm.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.240
Nora, we need to talk.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.640
Call me. Ugh.

43:05.170 --> 43:06.110
Hey. Hey.

43:06.330 --> 43:07.290
Where is your mom, and what the

43:07.570 --> 43:09.840
- hell is going on with her?
- You're asking the wrong guy.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.510
I am literally the last person
to know anything in my family.

43:12.700 --> 43:15.043
- Mom, Justin's not gonna sell.
- Well, good. That's great.

43:15.044 --> 43:17.480
But what about your mom and
Kevin and everybody else?

43:17.481 --> 43:19.480
Can you talk some sense into them?

43:20.830 --> 43:22.300
Uh, no. No, I can't.

43:22.510 --> 43:23.820
With all due respect, I'm not them.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.721
They... they make their own decisions.

43:25.722 --> 43:27.630
So just see me as me,
just like I see you...

43:27.810 --> 43:31.310
the mother of the woman I love. Wow.

43:31.610 --> 43:32.810
I didn't pay him to say that.

43:33.050 --> 43:36.610
- Um, you're right, Justin. I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's fine.

43:38.750 --> 43:39.890
Hey, has this painting always been here?

43:40.070 --> 43:42.480
Actually, it used to be
in your father's office.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.310
- Oh, that's why it looks so familiar.
- Yeah, my mom painted it.

43:45.520 --> 43:48.000
It's this place that
William used to take me...

43:48.260 --> 43:51.370
up the 5, a little cabin by the lake.

43:53.740 --> 43:54.980
A cabin by the lake?

43:55.580 --> 43:57.170
Mom, a lake.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.980
Oh, my God.

44:07.940 --> 44:08.810
So anything?

44:09.190 --> 44:12.520
- Well, the land in question was owned by a William.
- Walker?

44:12.720 --> 44:14.470
Hearst. William Randolph Hearst.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.670
Oh. They donated it to the state
of California a few years ago.

44:18.110 --> 44:19.600
So basically it's... a dead end.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.800
It's just a beautiful lake. That's all.

44:22.050 --> 44:24.100
Mom, I'm so sorry. Oh,
it's okay, sweetheart.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.150
- Don't give up.
- I won't. Thank you. Bye.

44:26.550 --> 44:28.540
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.230
I mean, what... what if she's
doing all of this for nothing?

44:32.400 --> 44:33.590
What if it doesn't lead anywhere?

44:33.760 --> 44:34.750
Where will she be then?

44:43.150 --> 44:44.000
What?

44:44.200 --> 44:45.230
What?

44:46.760 --> 44:48.510
What were you just thinking?

44:49.330 --> 44:50.590
Maybe we should do it.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.710
Get married, right here, right now.

44:53.510 --> 44:54.820
Justin, don't joke about that.

44:54.980 --> 44:56.790
- You know... you know I would.
- I'm not joking. I promise.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.970
Rebecca, you asked me
to marry you in Mexico,

44:59.160 --> 45:00.170
right here, right now, just us,

45:00.330 --> 45:02.600
and I said no because
my family wasn't there.

45:03.340 --> 45:05.570
You are my family.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.810
It's not about them. It's about us.

45:08.630 --> 45:11.140
So let's walk in there and say "I do."

45:12.220 --> 45:13.390
- Okay.
- Okay?

45:13.560 --> 45:15.120
Yeah. You wanna? Let's go.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.599
Justin, repeat after me.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.710
I, Justin, take you, Rebecca,

45:20.960 --> 45:22.810
to be my lawfully wedded spouse.

45:25.050 --> 45:28.180
I, Justin, take you, Rebecca,
to be my lawfully wedded spouse.

45:28.700 --> 45:32.320
I, Rebecca, take you, Justin,
to be my lawfully wedded spouse.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.540
Do you promise to love one another

45:34.770 --> 45:35.880
in sickness and in health,

45:36.120 --> 45:38.280
in prosperity and adversity...

45:38.570 --> 45:39.230
I do.

45:40.620 --> 45:41.640
I do.

45:43.830 --> 45:46.050
Then by the virtue of the
authority vested in me,

45:46.850 --> 45:49.740
I pronounce you married under the
laws of the state of California.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Okay, why are you telling me about
something that happened 20 years ago?

46:05.170 --> 46:06.670
Because, Scotty, there was a fight.

46:06.870 --> 46:10.130
Apparently, Kevin hit Aaron...

46:14.120 --> 46:15.940
Okay, will someone please
just tell me what's going on?

46:16.090 --> 46:18.800
Scotty, Scotty, Aaron
fell. He was paralyzed.

46:19.230 --> 46:20.630
Kevin found out today.

46:22.740 --> 46:24.980
Oh, my God. That's why he wasn't there.

46:26.590 --> 46:30.440
Uh, we had our, um,
second implantation today.

46:30.910 --> 46:32.800
- Oh, God. Oh.
- I... I waited with Michelle for two hours.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.510
I kept telling the doctor, "he'll be here.

46:34.650 --> 46:35.650
Just give him ten more minutes."

46:36.510 --> 46:39.110
- I mean, he didn't even call. Do you know where he is now?
- No.

46:39.450 --> 46:41.340
No. We have no idea.
That's why we came here.

46:45.610 --> 46:47.020
I want to sell Ojai.

46:47.230 --> 46:49.520
- What are you talking about?
- The secret is out, Sarah.

46:49.710 --> 46:52.690
- York has no leverage.
- It's not about York, Saul.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.810
It's about Kevin. It's about this family.

46:54.970 --> 46:57.530
We've just... we're
paying too high a price.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.100
I don't want anything else
to do with dad, his secrets...

47:00.210 --> 47:01.920
- Sarah, that's ridiculous. You're just...
- Saul, she's right.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.380
Enough with protecting
this... this legacy.

47:04.550 --> 47:06.000
Let's just be free of it.

47:08.790 --> 47:09.990
Oh. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

47:10.500 --> 47:11.520
What...

47:13.080 --> 47:14.210
What the hell is this?

47:14.710 --> 47:17.310
- Why are you even here?
- We... we couldn't find you.

47:18.060 --> 47:20.140
And Scotty didn't know about Aaron.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.710
So we... we filled him in.

47:21.940 --> 47:24.440
Oh, really? Did you tell
him how dad covered it all up

47:24.640 --> 47:27.960
by paying the family for years,
and when he died, mom took over?

47:28.110 --> 47:29.650
- Did you tell him that?
- Oh, come on,

47:29.810 --> 47:31.050
Kevin. She was in a terrible position.

47:31.210 --> 47:33.900
- What would you have her do?
- Please, please, do not do that, Saul.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.370
Because she is as bad as my father.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.070
Actually, she's worse. She
pretended to be above it.

47:42.940 --> 47:43.930
What have I done?

47:44.090 --> 47:46.130
Kevin, it is not your fault.

47:46.220 --> 47:48.290
I ruined his life, Scotty. He was a kid.

47:51.710 --> 47:53.670
Oh, my God. The implantation.

47:53.790 --> 47:54.980
- I am so sorry.
- It... it's okay.

47:55.110 --> 47:57.920
- It's not okay. I'm...
- Yes, it is. I went through with it.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.440
You did?

47:59.570 --> 48:01.290
We had to. We would've lost the embryos.

48:04.730 --> 48:05.840
Kevin. Kevin, wait.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.100
Kevin. Kev...

48:07.230 --> 48:08.640
look, look, I'm, uh, I'm really sorry.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.730
I thought coming home would help,

48:09.930 --> 48:11.410
but I actually can't
breathe. I just need some air.

48:11.550 --> 48:13.590
I just need some air.
I'll call you. I'm fine.

48:21.830 --> 48:23.050
Don't you get it?

48:23.370 --> 48:25.480
That lake, what... whatever it is,

48:25.670 --> 48:27.680
is the key to getting your family back.

48:27.990 --> 48:29.550
Holly, you know what? You are one of

48:29.690 --> 48:32.090
the most insensitive
people I have ever met.

48:32.240 --> 48:35.700
I'm not being insensitive. I
know what happened to Kevin,

48:35.870 --> 48:37.760
and if you want your children back...

48:37.950 --> 48:39.890
well, thank you so much for stopping by,

48:40.190 --> 48:43.010
- but I have to tell you, I...
- Then don't let them sell Ojai Foods!

48:43.310 --> 48:47.110
I know better than anyone
that Ojai is a family business.

48:47.310 --> 48:48.860
And once their anger fades,

48:49.050 --> 48:51.140
they are going to regret letting it go.

48:51.390 --> 48:54.190
Sarah and Tommy, they grew up there.

48:54.780 --> 48:56.870
And you've seen how much

48:57.070 --> 48:58.890
they have thrown
themselves into that place.

48:59.320 --> 49:03.240
Holly, I really can't tell
them what to do right now.

49:03.241 --> 49:03.684
Oh.

49:04.553 --> 49:06.640
I've made enough mistakes as it is.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.340
So what if you've made mistakes?

49:08.520 --> 49:10.910
Every single mother in
the history of mankind

49:11.110 --> 49:14.542
- has made mistakes.
- Well, you oughta know.

49:14.543 --> 49:18.690
Look, I did what I thought
was best for Rebecca.

49:18.890 --> 49:20.380
That's what you did with Kevin.

49:21.370 --> 49:23.360
We were just protecting our kids.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.770
So don't stop protecting them now.

49:28.670 --> 49:29.560
Yes.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.190
It's the lake.

49:41.960 --> 49:42.700
Mm-hmm.

49:43.710 --> 49:45.140
We have to find the lake.

49:46.490 --> 49:48.030
I've got a plan.

49:48.620 --> 49:52.190
Repeating the same thing slower
and softer is just condescending.

49:53.580 --> 49:55.170
Well, if you don't have the authority

49:55.330 --> 49:56.210
to change the reservation,

49:56.360 --> 49:57.850
put your manager on, and I'll hold.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.620
Okay. Hey, Mrs. Walker.

50:00.940 --> 50:02.820
- Hey. Ooh, I like the sound of that.
- Oh, you do?

50:03.300 --> 50:05.220
Mm. Can you hold on one second? Thank you.

50:06.050 --> 50:09.110
Babe, do you see the, uh, "press
your own penny" there thing?

50:09.280 --> 50:10.070
Can you... can you get me one?

50:11.090 --> 50:12.190
You want a flattened penny?

50:12.390 --> 50:15.110
- I like tchotchkes.
- Or are you just trying to get rid of me

50:15.300 --> 50:17.060
because you don't want me
to hear what you're planning?

50:17.210 --> 50:19.700
Well, can't a man surprise
his wife, for God sakes?

50:21.900 --> 50:25.680
Hey. Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I know the house was rented.

50:25.910 --> 50:27.730
But I just got married, and we eloped,

50:27.930 --> 50:29.500
and I wasn't able to plan a honeymoon.

50:29.710 --> 50:31.830
I mean, I... I really
want to make this special.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.600
My name is Justin Walker, and...

50:34.790 --> 50:37.460
Yeah. Yeah, Nora and William's youngest.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.830
Uh, everybody's good.

50:40.470 --> 50:42.060
So is there anything you can do?

50:42.770 --> 50:44.480
Oh. Thank you. Thank you so much.

50:44.630 --> 50:46.160
I... I'll call you back.
I'll call you back. Thank you.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.070
Honeymoon is all set.

50:49.280 --> 50:49.870
- It is?
- Yes.

50:50.050 --> 50:51.250
- Here's your souvenir.
- Thank you.

50:51.460 --> 50:52.840
Uh, and you know what else they have here?

50:53.020 --> 50:57.310
- What?
- They have the best date shakes in all of California.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.710
Milkshakes for breakfast?

50:59.890 --> 51:01.440
I knew I married you for a reason.

51:05.850 --> 51:08.740
- Mr. Burnett? Right this way.
- Oh, thank you.

51:09.570 --> 51:10.670
Hey. How'd it go?

51:11.190 --> 51:13.610
- Did Kevin call?
- No. No, not yet. You okay?

51:13.810 --> 51:15.540
I'm fine. Let's just get outta here.

51:15.730 --> 51:17.320
Wait. W... wait a minute. Wait a minute.

51:17.650 --> 51:19.700
This is your first look to find out...

51:20.220 --> 51:21.470
You know, what's going on with the cancer.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.880
I want to know what's going on.

51:24.050 --> 51:25.350
Oh, God. It was fine.

51:27.090 --> 51:28.990
I had a C.T. I had my blood drawn.

51:29.170 --> 51:31.240
It's just... I don't know.
It's just being back here is...

51:31.420 --> 51:34.300
you remember that girl, the
girl with all the piercings?

51:34.460 --> 51:35.260
Yeah.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.430
Well, she's back.

51:36.670 --> 51:38.150
And she's having another round of chemo.

51:38.270 --> 51:39.380
I mean, that's the thing, right?

51:39.510 --> 51:43.160
I mean, it's a crapshoot. You
either get lucky or you don't.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.710
Well, whatever happens, we're
gonna go through it together.

51:50.770 --> 51:52.220
Oh, it's Kevin.

51:52.450 --> 51:53.050
Yeah.

51:53.590 --> 51:56.240
- Hey, Kev, hi.
- Kit, you have to do me a favor.

51:56.420 --> 51:57.710
Call Scotty. Tell him I'm okay.

51:57.880 --> 51:59.340
I'm just not ready to talk yet.

51:59.670 --> 52:01.220
Sure, but, Kevin, what... what's going on?

52:03.150 --> 52:04.320
Kevin, it's me.

52:05.110 --> 52:06.440
I'm outside Aaron's house.

52:06.660 --> 52:07.970
I have to face him, kit.

52:08.700 --> 52:09.890
We have to talk about what I did.

52:10.130 --> 52:11.500
Kevin, I don't understand. What...

52:11.650 --> 52:13.100
what are you talking about, what you did?

52:13.800 --> 52:15.710
I'm gonna go, all right? But I love you.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.820
What happened to you?

52:20.890 --> 52:22.550
You... disappeared.

52:24.540 --> 52:25.850
Kitty, um...

52:27.150 --> 52:28.480
Can I tell you something?

52:28.790 --> 52:29.760
And you have to promise

52:29.920 --> 52:31.200
you won't say anything to anybody.

52:31.920 --> 52:32.760
Of course.

52:34.100 --> 52:36.440
I'm so drunk, I probably
won't remember anything anyway.

52:37.930 --> 52:38.620
All right.

52:38.950 --> 52:42.230
Um, you know that kid that I
was with tonight, um, Aaron?

52:42.490 --> 52:42.980
Mm-hmm.

52:43.230 --> 52:45.740
Yeah. He thought I liked him.

52:47.900 --> 52:48.510
So?

52:49.200 --> 52:53.330
I mean,"liked him" liked him.

52:54.760 --> 52:55.400
Oh.

52:58.020 --> 52:58.700
Do you?

52:58.870 --> 53:00.080
No. No.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.000
No.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.920
I... I don't... I don't know.

53:09.780 --> 53:10.520
Maybe.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.560
I mean, I haven't seen
him in, like, a year.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.150
And I've been... I've been
thinking about him a lot.

53:19.350 --> 53:22.690
And, um... tonight, when we were alone,

53:22.980 --> 53:24.200
before dad came...

53:25.510 --> 53:26.550
I, uh...

53:28.230 --> 53:29.590
I did the stupidest thing.

53:30.840 --> 53:31.600
What?

53:34.080 --> 53:36.640
Oh, God. I'm gay, aren't I?

53:37.280 --> 53:39.240
I am. I am. I'm totally gay.

53:40.940 --> 53:41.800
It's okay.

53:41.950 --> 53:42.920
No, it's not.

53:43.090 --> 53:46.760
Kitty, I mean, mom would have a breakdown.

53:47.030 --> 53:47.700
And dad?

53:49.400 --> 53:50.770
Dad would kill me.

53:52.420 --> 53:53.860
I wouldn't care.

53:55.390 --> 53:56.380
You wouldn't?

53:56.710 --> 54:00.160
I mean... aren't you a Republican?

54:00.830 --> 54:02.280
But I'm your sister first.

54:03.670 --> 54:05.340
I'll always love you, no matter what.

54:35.520 --> 54:36.250
Hey.

54:37.910 --> 54:38.720
Can I help you?

54:41.310 --> 54:42.140
Aaron?

54:43.100 --> 54:43.750
Yeah.

54:46.100 --> 54:47.520
I'm Kevin Walker.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.560
Thank you for seeing me.

54:53.410 --> 54:55.450
I've been in my car the past few hours

54:55.660 --> 54:57.160
trying to find the
courage to come in here.

54:58.520 --> 55:01.240
I'm not sure what you think
this is gonna accomplish.

55:01.980 --> 55:04.050
You sure waited a long time to stop by.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.370
Aaron, I am so sorry.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.110
I... I... I didn't know what had
happened to you until last night.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.560
Um, this might sound crazy.

55:11.730 --> 55:14.390
My parents told me that you were fine.

55:15.740 --> 55:17.560
Obviously, if... if I'd known...

55:24.240 --> 55:30.370
Listen... I... I'm sure you must be
feeling a lot of things right now,

55:30.560 --> 55:33.790
but, uh, that night, I don't dwell on it.

55:34.770 --> 55:37.130
I... I have worked long and hard

55:37.320 --> 55:39.630
to make sure that it didn't define me,

55:39.830 --> 55:41.930
and quite frankly, I'd
like to keep it that way.

55:42.150 --> 55:44.210
Of course. Uh, absolutely.

55:44.840 --> 55:47.120
And... and I'm not trying
to make this about me.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.580
Then why are you here?

55:52.200 --> 55:55.060
I'm gay, and I needed you to know that.

55:55.260 --> 55:57.130
I knew you were gay.

55:57.750 --> 55:59.300
Why do you think I tried to kiss you?

56:01.430 --> 56:03.100
And... and I wanted to,

56:03.890 --> 56:05.230
believe me, so badly.

56:05.430 --> 56:08.210
But I was... I was so scared
of the way I was feeling...

56:10.040 --> 56:10.900
instead...

56:11.090 --> 56:12.000
You hit me.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.170
Look...

56:20.570 --> 56:23.150
I had a lot of rage about what happened,

56:23.350 --> 56:25.380
and I'm not gonna pretend
it wasn't directed at you.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.560
But not anymore.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.530
I moved on.

56:30.870 --> 56:32.780
I have a partner now. We have a life.

56:34.690 --> 56:37.120
What happened... happened.

56:38.250 --> 56:44.190
That two boys couldn't share a
kiss and feel all the normal things

56:44.370 --> 56:47.320
you're supposed to feel at that
age, that wasn't your fault.

56:48.250 --> 56:52.010
You were just acting the
way the world wanted you to.

56:53.480 --> 56:54.740
I made peace with that.

56:56.070 --> 56:57.570
And you need to do the same.

56:58.270 --> 56:59.340
But not here...

57:00.090 --> 57:01.230
Not with me.

57:14.590 --> 57:17.310
Oh, my God. This is beautiful.

57:17.770 --> 57:19.610
Well, look, I know it's
not the four seasons,

57:19.770 --> 57:21.820
- but what do you think?
- I love it.

57:22.030 --> 57:23.280
Where did you find this place?

57:23.520 --> 57:26.530
Well, remember the Ojai
house my family used to own?

57:26.670 --> 57:28.220
This is the Ojai house? Oh, my God.

57:28.350 --> 57:30.160
I can't believe it. I've
heard so many stories.

57:30.310 --> 57:31.450
Well, look, the people who bought it,

57:31.600 --> 57:33.250
they rent it out now, so I
was able to talk the landlord

57:33.390 --> 57:35.990
into giving it to us.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.060
Anyway, more than anyplace else,

57:38.230 --> 57:40.640
this is the place I
remember being the happiest.

57:43.500 --> 57:44.810
I love that you brought me here.

57:44.970 --> 57:45.580
Oh.

57:46.640 --> 57:47.720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

57:47.930 --> 57:48.530
What?

57:52.470 --> 57:53.690
We're in! We're in.

58:00.970 --> 58:02.480
Okay, target on the move.

58:02.680 --> 58:05.270
Holly, I... I just really
don't know that I can do this.

58:05.500 --> 58:08.250
What? Of course you can.
Just keep him talking.

58:08.450 --> 58:09.530
Well, what if I can't?

58:09.730 --> 58:12.390
Don't chicken out on me
now. You're Louise, remember?

58:12.620 --> 58:14.230
I thought you wanted to be Louise?

58:14.390 --> 58:15.710
You said she had street smarts.

58:15.870 --> 58:17.290
Fine. Fine. Then be Thelma.

58:17.430 --> 58:19.450
Just keep him in his chair
until you get a text from me.

58:19.750 --> 58:21.530
- All right. Just be quick about it.
- I will.

58:26.420 --> 58:27.510
Excuse me.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.520
Are you gonna be much
longer? I just need to change.

58:30.700 --> 58:31.720
I'm just leaving.

58:31.920 --> 58:32.740
Oh, great.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.500
Would you like turndown service later?

58:34.660 --> 58:36.010
Absolutely. Thank you.

58:44.890 --> 58:45.620
Hi.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.220
Hi.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.750
Thanks for seeing me.

58:51.430 --> 58:54.530
Ah, I wish this wasn't
such a contentious deal.

58:55.340 --> 58:58.230
It never felt like a deal.
It felt like an ambush.

58:59.370 --> 59:00.810
If you came down here to vent...

59:00.990 --> 59:03.060
No, I didn't. I... I didn't. I'm sorry.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.710
I came down for this.

59:06.130 --> 59:07.710
This is an agreement guaranteeing

59:08.040 --> 59:10.930
that if the sale of Ojai
goes through, you won't let

59:11.060 --> 59:13.630
any of the employees
go for at least a year.

59:13.770 --> 59:16.070
And I thought that you and I
should go through this together.

59:16.310 --> 59:18.230
- Won't be necessary.
- There... y... look, I... I...

59:18.580 --> 59:20.770
Honestly, I don't want there
to be any misunderstanding...

59:20.930 --> 59:23.790
Look, I have no intention
of firing anyone.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.810
As a matter of fact, I
hope to be hiring soon.

59:26.030 --> 59:26.830
Hiring?

59:27.060 --> 59:27.730
Mm-hmm.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.660
Oh, come on, Dennis. You won.

59:31.370 --> 59:32.290
Give me a hint.

59:32.820 --> 59:35.580
What makes Ojai Foods so valuable?

59:37.410 --> 59:38.540
Nice try.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.518
If you don't mind, I really
should get back to my room

59:47.519 --> 59:51.010
- and make a few calls.
- Dennis, Dennis...

59:51.530 --> 59:53.520
What happened to you?

59:54.660 --> 59:56.410
You used to be so sweet.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.080
Yeah.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:06.370
That was before William ended up with

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.400
pretty much everything I ever wanted...

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.780
the business, you.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.550
I think it made me crazy.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.220
Oh. Mm.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.080
Have you ever wondered, um...

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.570
If you made the right decision,

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.380
staying with William?

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.990
You know...

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:38.520
It could've been you and me, Nora.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.810
I don't know. Sure.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:45.270
I... I... I wondered.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.090
Sorry. I have to go.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.140
Wish I could stay. Kind of an emergency.

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.660
Listen, could you at
least answer my question?

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:00.220
Right.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.970
Dennis...

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.490
The thing about William,

01:01:06.491 --> 01:01:08.691
he never wanted to openly hurt anyone.

01:01:08.692 --> 01:01:09.950
That's why he hid everything.

01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:12.260
You, on the other hand,
take pleasure in it.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.990
Did I ever wish I had
left William for you?

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.600
No. Not for a second.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.600
- I completely struck out.
- You didn't find anything?

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.210
No, no, all I found
is a bunch of receipts.

01:01:30.211 --> 01:01:32.214
- I don't know what they're for.
- Wait a minute. What's this?

01:01:32.215 --> 01:01:34.295
- It's a valet ticket.
- Bingo.

01:01:34.296 --> 01:01:36.990
- Bingo?
- Could we have our car right away?

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.649
- We're trying to get to the movies.
- Sure.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.500
- We don't want to be late.
- What are you doing?

01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:41.485
Well, isn't it obvious?

01:01:41.486 --> 01:01:43.510
You didn't find anything in his room.

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:44.480
He doesn't have an office.

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:45.780
He must keep everything in his car.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.410
So, what, you're gonna take his car?

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.000
- We're gonna look in his car. You started this, Holly.
- Oh, my...

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.600
- Here he is. Come on.
- I've created a monster.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.560
Nora, think before you act.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.360
Come on. Look in the car, Holly.

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:57.760
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.803
Look. He has one of those
navigational GPS systems.

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:03.684
That means if he's been to Narrow
Lake, maybe it will be logged in.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:08.087
- Okay, that's good, that's good.
- Just look on that part of the car
Holly, look under the seat.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.766
- That's him.
- Ok, get out of the car.

01:02:09.766 --> 01:02:11.305
- Get on the car! - Get out
of the car!! - Get on the car!

01:02:11.305 --> 01:02:13.115
Get in the car, get in the car!

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.872
Get in the car.

01:02:21.902 --> 01:02:25.337
Look, he stopped at every hot dog stand,

01:02:25.352 --> 01:02:29.392
greasy spoon and hamburger
joint in Ojai valley.

01:02:29.399 --> 01:02:32.185
And we're not closer
to finding Narrow Lake.

01:02:32.192 --> 01:02:33.694
* Let's go, let's go.... *

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:38.124
The only destination that he flied
are the one where there's a good food.

01:02:38.132 --> 01:02:42.277
- * Narrow Lake...*
- Would you please stop singing, you're driving me crazy.

01:02:42.284 --> 01:02:43.992
I'm trying to remember
the rest of this song,

01:02:43.992 --> 01:02:47.060
it's William's song about
Narrow Lake, I can't remember it.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.108
Well, obvisouly you didn't exaggerate
about the shakes, they're very good.

01:02:50.108 --> 01:02:54.614
Hmm, yeah, they're great. We always used to
stop here on our way to the old Ojai house.

01:02:54.622 --> 01:02:56.440
All the kids have had a day shake.

01:02:56.883 --> 01:03:01.419
- We gotta go. There's a lot more in the GPS.
- * Let's go out tonight... *

01:03:02.184 --> 01:03:05.240
Come on Nora let's go.
Put some pep in your step.

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:07.343
What?

01:03:08.236 --> 01:03:10.879
- What did you say?
- Put some pep in your step.

01:03:11.607 --> 01:03:14.641
Pep... the pepper... put
the pepper in your stepper...

01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:16.953
with a pepper in your stepper
and a glint in your eye

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:19.806
we'll follow the dream into
our future you and I. That's it.

01:03:19.814 --> 01:03:22.044
- That's it.
- That's the song William used to sing?

01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:23.592
That's awful.

01:03:23.607 --> 01:03:29.104
With the pepper.... the pepper.... with a pepper
in your stepper. What the hell does that mean?

01:03:29.126 --> 01:03:31.327
It means he had too much to drink.

01:03:31.342 --> 01:03:35.374
Oh, Holly, tell me again, when was
it that Williamn bought Narrow Lake?

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:37.034
Summer of '73.

01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:40.143
'73. 1973. The summer of 1973

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.597
I had four kids, all under the age of six

01:03:43.605 --> 01:03:48.238
- William worked all the time...
- Did he ever take a business trip, and you
didn't know where he was going?

01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:53.254
Come on Holly, William took an excessive amount
of business trips, I just chose to ignore them.

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:55.935
But did he say he was going to buy land?

01:03:56.051 --> 01:03:58.521
No, I don't know. I don't remember.

01:03:58.552 --> 01:03:59.866
No, he....

01:04:01.353 --> 01:04:02.644
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

01:04:02.659 --> 01:04:04.619
There was this one time...

01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:07.277
and I remember Holly, because...

01:04:07.315 --> 01:04:10.935
the night before he took me to
this party, somewhere in Malibu,

01:04:10.942 --> 01:04:18.121
and he spent the entire time, flirting with this lady blonde and I had to stay
in the corner and chat with his business associates about products all night...

01:04:18.128 --> 01:04:21.530
When did he say he was going to buy land?
Cause it might have been Narrow Lake.

01:04:21.529 --> 01:04:23.918
Come on. He's hanging
all over this blonde.

01:04:23.919 --> 01:04:26.694
Next morning, he says he
has to go look for land.

01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:28.378
No, no.

01:04:28.379 --> 01:04:31.148
He spent the entire weekend
in bed with the blonde.

01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:32.804
You don't know that.

01:04:32.844 --> 01:04:35.604
If I've learned anything,
I've learned that.

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:39.284
Unless you have proof to the contrary.

01:04:39.285 --> 01:04:40.838
Oh. Well, Nora...

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:43.976
I think we should talk a... a...

01:04:43.977 --> 01:04:45.637
Oh, it's Robert.

01:04:45.638 --> 01:04:47.154
No, no, don't answer it.

01:04:47.155 --> 01:04:49.144
But it might be about
Kevin. I have to answer this.

01:04:49.145 --> 01:04:49.852
Oh, God.

01:04:52.332 --> 01:04:53.942
She spoke to Kevin. He's fine.

01:04:53.943 --> 01:04:55.766
Oh thank God.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.661
What's that?

01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:59.354
Um, nothing. It was the TV.

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:00.558
Nora, where are you?

01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:02.724
Don't say anything.

01:05:02.725 --> 01:05:04.560
Um, I'm... I'm taking a little road trip.

01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:06.669
Right now, while your family's
in the middle of a crisis?

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.335
- Well, I'm upset.
- Stop it!

01:05:08.336 --> 01:05:09.671
I gotta go.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:13.215
Nora, something is going
on. You are a horrible liar.

01:05:13.216 --> 01:05:15.091
All right. Fine.

01:05:15.092 --> 01:05:17.725
I'm looking for Narrow Lake with Holly.

01:05:17.726 --> 01:05:19.952
We just stole Dennis York's car.

01:05:19.953 --> 01:05:22.935
No! It was unintentional,
and I'll get it back to him.

01:05:22.936 --> 01:05:24.583
I just don't want it to
hurt Kitty's campaign.

01:05:24.584 --> 01:05:26.391
You should've thought of
that before you stole a car!

01:05:26.392 --> 01:05:28.078
- Hindsight is 20...
- Give me the phone.

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:30.405
All right, look, I'm sure
that this is Holly's fault...

01:05:30.406 --> 01:05:32.573
I had nothing to do with this.

01:05:32.574 --> 01:05:34.534
Hi, Holly. Where are you?

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:37.629
You're driving around on freeways?!

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.927
Well, we can't take the
surface streets to Ojai.

01:05:39.928 --> 01:05:42.601
Look, I know that Nora is nutty enough

01:05:42.602 --> 01:05:43.971
to do something like this, but you?

01:05:43.972 --> 01:05:46.147
Hi, Robert. This is Nutty Nora.

01:05:46.148 --> 01:05:49.474
Okay, could I just have
one conversation at a time?

01:05:49.475 --> 01:05:51.836
Did York see you take the car?

01:05:51.837 --> 01:05:52.638
No.

01:05:52.639 --> 01:05:56.290
Well, maybe. Okay. Yeah, I think he did.

01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.076
You cannot be driving
around in a stolen car.

01:05:58.077 --> 01:06:00.366
We're not gonna be driving
around in a stolen car.

01:06:00.367 --> 01:06:02.656
All right? We're gonna...
we're gonna pull over someplace

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:03.953
and we're gonna figure all of this out.

01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:07.491
We're... and I know the perfect place.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.214
Oh, God, I'm so lucky.

01:06:16.214 --> 01:06:17.998
Yes, you are.

01:06:19.079 --> 01:06:20.114
Mm. Oh, I love you so much.

01:06:20.115 --> 01:06:21.044
I love you, too.

01:06:24.044 --> 01:06:27.273
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:28.778
What...

01:06:28.779 --> 01:06:30.068
What the hell? Why?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.065
- The... the door was unlocked.
- We're so sorry.

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:33.747
- What the hell is going on?
- We were in the area.

01:06:33.748 --> 01:06:35.401
Yeah, we were looking for Narrow Lake,

01:06:35.402 --> 01:06:37.135
and we needed a... to stop for a while.

01:06:37.136 --> 01:06:38.605
I called the real estate office.

01:06:38.606 --> 01:06:39.817
- They said you were here.
- Yeah.

01:06:39.818 --> 01:06:41.308
What is that all they said?

01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:43.252
Should there have been something else?

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:44.407
- No.
- No, no, no.

01:06:44.408 --> 01:06:47.472
- Gosh, we're sorry to interrupt your romantic little weekend.
- We'll just go...

01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:48.850
- we're gonna go into the kitchen.
- Great idea.

01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:51.379
Take your time..

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.190
Thank you for that, ma.
That's... that's really sweet.

01:06:53.191 --> 01:06:57.346
- I hate them... so much.
- I hate them.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.521
You know, I think it's really amazing

01:07:00.522 --> 01:07:01.587
that you talked to Aaron today.

01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:04.519
But he's right.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.438
This is something I have
to... deal with alone.

01:07:07.439 --> 01:07:08.589
I just don't know how.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:12.935
You know, Kev, I had to go
to the hospital this morning.

01:07:12.936 --> 01:07:15.928
They gave me a test to
see if my cancer came back.

01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:17.640
Are you having any symptoms?

01:07:17.641 --> 01:07:19.649
No, no. It's just a standard procedure.

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.151
Uh, I'm still waiting for the results.

01:07:22.152 --> 01:07:23.680
But the... the point is,

01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:25.542
is I don't know whether
they're gonna be good or bad.

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:29.087
And if they're good, I suppose that means

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:30.624
that somebody else is gonna get a call

01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:32.069
saying that their cancer is back.

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:33.611
It's not the same.

01:07:33.612 --> 01:07:35.380
You... you didn't cause that.

01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:38.698
Well... that's true.

01:07:38.699 --> 01:07:42.954
But what happened to
Aaron was an accident, too.

01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:47.915
Why he fell the way he did
and why you didn't, it...

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:51.065
Kev...

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:53.735
There's no answer to it.

01:08:09.746 --> 01:08:12.216
Is Kevin okay?

01:08:12.217 --> 01:08:15.013
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

01:08:15.014 --> 01:08:17.154
He's with Kitty. He won't talk to me.

01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:18.872
Well, mom, you know,

01:08:18.872 --> 01:08:20.694
I did a lot worse than
lying when I was using,

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:21.542
and you all forgave me.

01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:24.564
He's... gonna forgive you.
It's just gonna take time.

01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:28.211
Are you expecting someone?

01:08:30.078 --> 01:08:31.145
Hello.

01:08:33.212 --> 01:08:35.328
I rented this place.
What are you doing here?

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.609
Looking for her. Mom,
have you lost your mind?

01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:38.966
I know this looks bad.

01:08:38.968 --> 01:08:41.880
Bad? Robert just called me to
say that you've stolen a car.

01:08:41.881 --> 01:08:43.167
What, you stole that car?

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:44.510
I was gonna tell you about that.

01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:46.246
Mom, whatever you're doing, stop.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.663
Oh, my God. There are more of you.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.872
I told you not to tell Robert anything.

01:08:49.872 --> 01:08:51.553
What else did you tell her not to say?

01:08:51.554 --> 01:08:53.362
- Is she responsible for this?
- No.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:55.776
It was my idea to steal the car.

01:08:55.777 --> 01:08:58.652
Look, Sarah. We're trying
to find Narrow Lake.

01:08:58.653 --> 01:08:59.581
That makes perfect sense.

01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:00.843
You're driving around in a stolen car

01:09:00.844 --> 01:09:02.694
looking for a lake that
you don't think exists.

01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:04.162
Why don't you let her explain?

01:09:04.163 --> 01:09:05.615
Because she's not making any sense.

01:09:05.616 --> 01:09:07.153
Sarah, I know it sounds crazy...

01:09:07.154 --> 01:09:08.569
yeah, it does, mom, but
I don't want to hear it.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.727
I promised Robert that I would
tell you to return the car.

01:09:10.728 --> 01:09:13.151
So return the damn car.
Tommy, are you coming?

01:09:13.152 --> 01:09:14.180
Sarah!

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.890
Please. Please don't just leave.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.130
After what just happened,
it's a little hard

01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:20.818
to get excited about a lake, mom.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:23.283
I'm so sorry. I made a lot of mistakes.

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:25.328
I'm not a perfect person. I'm sorry.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.005
Well, it's a little late for apologies.

01:09:27.006 --> 01:09:29.515
Look, sell Ojai or don't sell Ojai.

01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:32.497
I don't care. But Holly
and I need more time.

01:09:32.497 --> 01:09:33.622
I have to find Narrow Lake.

01:09:33.624 --> 01:09:34.255
- Okay, you know what, guys?
- Stop it.

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:36.912
Has it even occurred to you
why Rebecca and I are here?

01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:40.317
- Did something else happen?
- Yeah, we got married.

01:09:40.318 --> 01:09:44.247
What? Oh, my goodness.

01:09:44.249 --> 01:09:45.048
When?

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:47.457
At the court house. We
eloped. This is our honeymoon.

01:09:47.457 --> 01:09:49.901
I... I... I stupidly thought
this would be the perfect place

01:09:49.902 --> 01:09:52.537
to come celebrate our marriage.
Okay? So figure it out.

01:09:52.538 --> 01:09:54.024
Who the hell is that?

01:09:59.203 --> 01:10:01.489
I'm looking for Nora Walker.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.663
And Holly...

01:10:06.664 --> 01:10:08.093
Harper?

01:10:08.094 --> 01:10:09.982
You're both under arrest.

01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:17.531
I can't really blame them, eloping.

01:10:17.532 --> 01:10:21.916
I suppose so, but I missed
my only daughter's wedding.

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.661
Well, when we get out of here,

01:10:23.662 --> 01:10:25.209
we'll throw them a great big party.

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:27.038
Yeah. We'll have to celebrate.

01:10:30.073 --> 01:10:32.189
- Holly.
- Hmm?

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.466
Thanks.

01:10:33.467 --> 01:10:34.561
"Thanks"?

01:10:34.562 --> 01:10:37.355
We were just booked for grand theft auto.

01:10:37.356 --> 01:10:39.844
Yes, I know. Well, that's my fault.

01:10:39.845 --> 01:10:42.336
But I don't know. Maybe
they're right what they say.

01:10:42.337 --> 01:10:43.751
Sometimes, it's about the journey,

01:10:43.752 --> 01:10:45.467
and the journey today...

01:10:47.384 --> 01:10:48.395
Well, if I didn't know better,

01:10:48.396 --> 01:10:50.311
I would think we were almost friends.

01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:55.348
What?

01:10:55.349 --> 01:10:57.946
Well, I should've told you
about this this morning,

01:10:57.947 --> 01:11:00.075
but our history is so complicated,

01:11:00.076 --> 01:11:01.738
and I didn't want to rock the boat.

01:11:01.739 --> 01:11:03.579
Oh, God. Should I brace myself?

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.464
You know that leggy
blonde that you saw William

01:11:06.465 --> 01:11:08.363
flirting with at the party in '73?

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.978
That was me.

01:11:09.979 --> 01:11:11.450
You?

01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:14.233
Yeah, that was the first night I met him.

01:11:20.427 --> 01:11:22.068
Holly, forget about it.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:23.777
Forget about it. I don't care.

01:11:23.778 --> 01:11:26.795
I am so over this, I
can't begin to tell you.

01:11:26.796 --> 01:11:29.118
Honestly. I knew he was a womanizer.

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:32.399
I just wanted to keep
what we had, our family,

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.556
and... ugh, who cares?

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:37.614
I know you think that he
slept with that leggy blonde...

01:11:37.615 --> 01:11:39.348
you. Me... that weekend.

01:11:39.349 --> 01:11:41.217
And you want it proved to the contrary.

01:11:41.218 --> 01:11:42.711
Well, I've got it.

01:11:42.712 --> 01:11:46.804
It was more than a
month before we had sex.

01:11:46.805 --> 01:11:48.574
I really wouldn't push it if I were you.

01:11:48.575 --> 01:11:49.549
I know, I know, I know.

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:51.119
But what I'm saying is, he wasn't with me,

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.338
so maybe he was really
looking for land like he said.

01:11:54.339 --> 01:11:57.083
Oh, my God.

01:11:57.084 --> 01:12:00.966
You mean, maybe he was
telling me the truth for once?

01:12:00.967 --> 01:12:03.274
- Maybe he was out looking for land?
- It's possible.

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.033
- But that doesn't give me...
- Check-out time, ladies.

01:12:05.034 --> 01:12:07.050
- Oh. Oh, Robert.
- Hi!

01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:10.544
Y... you know what? Hang on just
one second. This is too good.

01:12:10.545 --> 01:12:12.984
Oh, no! No! No!

01:12:18.109 --> 01:12:18.992
Oh, it's mom.

01:12:18.993 --> 01:12:19.935
I'm not here.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:21.747
Hi, mom.

01:12:21.748 --> 01:12:25.053
Uh, yeah, yeah, he's here.

01:12:25.054 --> 01:12:26.440
He's, uh, he's doing okay.

01:12:26.441 --> 01:12:27.911
What?

01:12:27.912 --> 01:12:30.334
You're kidding me.

01:12:31.995 --> 01:12:34.751
Well, y... well, yeah, of cour...

01:12:34.752 --> 01:12:37.816
Well, yeah. Yes, mom. I...
I said that I would tell him.

01:12:37.817 --> 01:12:40.074
But you need to let me get off the phone.

01:12:40.075 --> 01:12:42.825
What?

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.273
Well, you're never gonna believe this.

01:12:44.274 --> 01:12:47.181
Our baby brother got married.

01:12:48.802 --> 01:12:50.154
You're right. I don't believe it.

01:12:50.155 --> 01:12:52.743
It's true. And they're... they're
all up at the old house in Ojai.

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:55.335
- And they're having a dinner.
- Oh, no.

01:12:55.336 --> 01:12:57.375
- Unh-unh. Kev, Kev, you gotta go.
- No.

01:12:57.376 --> 01:12:58.943
Oh, yes, Kevin. We have to go.

01:12:58.944 --> 01:13:00.424
Your brother got married.

01:13:11.358 --> 01:13:12.948
Kevin.

01:13:12.949 --> 01:13:15.124
Hey.

01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:19.124
You all right?

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:21.352
No, but, um, I'm here. So...

01:13:21.353 --> 01:13:24.738
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

01:13:24.739 --> 01:13:26.202
You don't need to apologize. All right?

01:13:26.203 --> 01:13:29.095
I should've pushed dad
for some more answers.

01:13:29.096 --> 01:13:31.120
Well, we were kids. We
just did what we were told.

01:13:31.121 --> 01:13:33.607
But I don't want you guys to
sell the company because of me.

01:13:33.608 --> 01:13:36.322
- We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

01:13:36.323 --> 01:13:38.240
Is that Scotty?

01:13:38.241 --> 01:13:39.214
Yeah.

01:13:45.098 --> 01:13:47.604
I'm... I'm glad you're here.

01:13:49.502 --> 01:13:51.169
Well, I'm here because
of Justin and Rebecca.

01:13:57.079 --> 01:14:00.824
Rebecca, I always wanted the
perfect wedding for you...

01:14:00.825 --> 01:14:02.804
the flowers, the music and the dress.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.653
And you'd think that I
would be a little upset

01:14:05.654 --> 01:14:09.318
about not being invited
to my only child's wedding.

01:14:09.319 --> 01:14:13.025
But, sweetie, I have
never seen you happier.

01:14:14.753 --> 01:14:16.997
And, Justin, I want to thank you

01:14:16.998 --> 01:14:19.855
for taking such good
care of my little girl.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.548
Every time I see you looking at her

01:14:22.549 --> 01:14:24.922
as if she is the center of your world,

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:28.489
I am so happy that you're
gonna be part of our family.

01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:29.787
Thank you.

01:14:29.788 --> 01:14:34.369
Oh, and, Rebecca, I talked to you
father, and he told me to tell you

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:37.023
that you're gonna have
to do this all over again,

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:45.818
cheers.

01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.516
Okay, Justin.

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:49.739
You really are an amazing little brother.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:54.488
We can always count on you
for compassion and kindness.

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:58.599
And you're also a handful.
Come on. Let's face it.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.994
You've made more than your
fair share of mistakes.

01:15:01.521 --> 01:15:05.035
But you always come
back to what matters...

01:15:05.036 --> 01:15:08.123
Love...

01:15:08.124 --> 01:15:10.089
And family.

01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:17.854
Cheers.

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.823
Uh, a special cheers to the senator

01:15:21.824 --> 01:15:24.707
for bailing out our mothers out of jail.

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:27.125
Oh, hear, hear!

01:15:27.126 --> 01:15:29.202
And I have photos.

01:15:29.203 --> 01:15:32.233
Yes. I'll delete them for the campaign,

01:15:32.234 --> 01:15:34.659
- but how about that, huh?
- Oh!

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.688
Oh, stop!

01:15:43.636 --> 01:15:45.707
That is awful. I hate you.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.183
I... ugh!

01:15:47.184 --> 01:15:51.173
Oh, my God.

01:15:51.174 --> 01:15:52.672
Hello?

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:54.718
Oh, hi, Dr. Avadon.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.753
Who is ready for some cake?

01:16:00.754 --> 01:16:02.329
Me. Me.

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:05.389
Um, actually, I'd... I'd
like to say something first.

01:16:07.581 --> 01:16:11.332
I guess if there's one
thing I've learned recently

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.108
it's, uh, nothing makes
sense in this world.

01:16:14.109 --> 01:16:16.027
It's a mystery to me how anything happens.

01:16:16.028 --> 01:16:18.830
But it's what we do about it that counts.

01:16:18.831 --> 01:16:22.625
How you both met... that was fate.

01:16:22.626 --> 01:16:25.179
But that doesn't mean it was easy,

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.493
and a lot of things came
between you and your love.

01:16:27.494 --> 01:16:31.178
But you showed faith in
each other and in the future,

01:16:31.179 --> 01:16:33.668
and that's what I'd like to toast.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:38.078
To trusting that the end is worth it

01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:41.032
and never letting go of its promise.

01:16:41.033 --> 01:16:44.893
Cheers.

01:16:44.894 --> 01:16:48.926
- Cheers.
- Thank you, Kevin. Cheers.

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.299
Kitty, what's wrong?

01:16:52.627 --> 01:16:54.223
Nothing.

01:16:54.224 --> 01:16:56.510
Nothing. I just... that was, um...

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:59.405
that was really beautiful, Kev.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.140
Kitty, what's going on?

01:17:04.468 --> 01:17:07.861
Well, I, uh, I just, um...

01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:12.446
I just got my results from
my first look cancer checkup.

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:18.441
And I'm cancer-free.

01:17:18.442 --> 01:17:22.142
I'm in remission.

01:17:30.374 --> 01:17:34.490
I shall be released

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.721
Mmm. Mom.

01:17:37.722 --> 01:17:41.149
I swear, you could make cake
stranded on a deserted island.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.748
You're, like, the MacGyver of food.

01:17:42.749 --> 01:17:44.653
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

01:17:44.654 --> 01:17:48.067
Oh, honey, I know I didn't
make a speech tonight, but...

01:17:48.068 --> 01:17:51.423
I wanted you to know how
happy I am for the two of you.

01:17:51.424 --> 01:17:53.423
- And I'm so proud of you.
- Oh, thanks, mom.

01:17:53.424 --> 01:17:55.625
I love you.

01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:57.263
Oh, and just think,

01:17:57.264 --> 01:17:59.913
one more dinner in the old Ojai house.

01:18:02.385 --> 01:18:06.213
You know all those summers we
used to spend up here as kids,

01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:08.025
you know, running around
trying not to kill each other?

01:18:08.026 --> 01:18:09.481
You know what my favorite part was, mom?

01:18:09.482 --> 01:18:12.334
When you'd call us in from the backyard.

01:18:12.335 --> 01:18:15.909
Oh, yes.

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:18.662
You would all come racing in,
tripping all over each other

01:18:18.663 --> 01:18:20.260
trying to be the first
one at the dinner table.

01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:22.661
Yeah, and dad would be sitting
at the head of the table

01:18:22.662 --> 01:18:26.601
giving us his stupid quizzes
and word puzzles, but you...

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:29.387
you would want to know
everything about our day...

01:18:29.388 --> 01:18:32.578
whatever crazy idea we had or whatever,

01:18:32.579 --> 01:18:33.525
you'd listen to it all.

01:18:34.928 --> 01:18:37.462
The most important
people in the world, mom.

01:18:39.612 --> 01:18:41.769
Well, at least I did something right.

01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:43.301
You did.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.058
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

01:18:47.059 --> 01:18:49.489
No, after you two barging
in on my honeymoon today...

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:50.858
Oh, right. Sorry.

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:53.461
Oh, my God. I can't believe
we interrupted your honeymoon.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.361
Well, speaking of "honeymoon," mom,

01:18:55.362 --> 01:18:58.053
I figured you might want
something for your scrapbook.

01:18:58.054 --> 01:18:59.470
You know, the "press a penny" place

01:18:59.471 --> 01:19:02.336
- with the date shakes?
- Yeah, we each had one.

01:19:05.184 --> 01:19:07.494
Oh, my God. What?

01:19:07.495 --> 01:19:08.533
- I know it's lame, but...
- No.

01:19:08.534 --> 01:19:11.949
Holly, that weekend.

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:12.723
What weekend?

01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:16.509
Well, your mom remembers this
weekend in the summer of '73

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:18.302
when your dad said he
was looking for land.

01:19:18.303 --> 01:19:20.287
I remember now.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.801
He brought me back one of these.

01:19:22.802 --> 01:19:25.768
So he was looking for land...

01:19:25.769 --> 01:19:28.004
Somewhere around here.

01:19:28.005 --> 01:19:29.694
I'm gonna get the map.

01:19:38.099 --> 01:19:39.337
It's so beautiful out here.

01:19:39.338 --> 01:19:40.813
Yeah, I know.

01:19:40.814 --> 01:19:44.083
It's so quiet.

01:19:44.084 --> 01:19:46.728
Yeah, I feel like a storm's passed.

01:19:50.643 --> 01:19:53.932
Tommy, what if we're making
a mistake selling Ojai?

01:19:53.933 --> 01:19:57.591
Would you ever think about coming back?

01:19:59.358 --> 01:20:01.760
I don't know.

01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:04.661
Well, I'll say one thing,

01:20:04.662 --> 01:20:07.057
whatever dad's expectations of us were

01:20:07.058 --> 01:20:09.600
or whatever his vision
for the company was,

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:11.442
I don't really care about them anymore.

01:20:11.443 --> 01:20:14.465
Hey, listen, if you could do anything...

01:20:14.466 --> 01:20:17.239
absolutely anything... with Ojai,

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:17.987
what would it be?

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:21.747
Hypothetically?

01:20:21.748 --> 01:20:22.777
Yeah.

01:20:22.778 --> 01:20:24.375
I would, um...

01:20:24.376 --> 01:20:30.361
I'd take that parcel of land up by
Victorville, plant wild strawberries.

01:20:30.362 --> 01:20:33.263
Strawberries.

01:20:33.264 --> 01:20:33.842
Yeah.

01:20:35.777 --> 01:20:36.748
I like that idea.

01:20:38.506 --> 01:20:41.896
Okay, so these are all the
destinations in York's GPS?

01:20:41.897 --> 01:20:43.148
Yes, here's the list right here.

01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:45.461
Yeah, we kept going in a
circle, which is what I said.

01:20:45.462 --> 01:20:47.913
We kept passing the same hill
with the same mesquite tree.

01:20:47.914 --> 01:20:50.554
You know that tree,
Saul, that great big tree,

01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:52.163
right there at the turnoff at 150?

01:20:52.164 --> 01:20:54.188
Yeah, I know it, except
it's a pepper tree.

01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:56.207
It's a pepper tree?

01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:57.605
- Oh, wait. You don't think...
- Pepper in your stepper...

01:20:57.606 --> 01:20:58.182
Pepper... with a pepper in your stepper.

01:20:58.183 --> 01:21:00.274
Kevin, come here. We're trying
to solve one of dad's puzzles.

01:21:00.275 --> 01:21:01.711
Can't. Scotty's already in the car.

01:21:01.712 --> 01:21:03.675
Come on. You're the best at
trying to figure this stuff out.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.051
Just a little ditty.

01:21:09.708 --> 01:21:10.949
All right. What's...

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:14.141
What's the circle for?

01:21:14.142 --> 01:21:16.779
The trail that York left
with his food obsessions.

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.433
Or else he was driving back
and forth to Narrow Lake

01:21:19.434 --> 01:21:20.124
That's it!

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.942
- What?
- Look, that's it. If... if York was driving back and forth,

01:21:22.943 --> 01:21:24.489
if you triangulate all the stops,

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:26.005
here is the center right here.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:27.658
Wait. But what's that road?

01:21:27.659 --> 01:21:30.579
- Calle de Los Suenos.
- Street of dreams.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:33.364
Follow the dream, the
dreams... you... you and I.

01:21:33.365 --> 01:21:36.518
Pepper... pepper in your stepper,
dreams. This has gotta be it.

01:21:36.519 --> 01:21:38.253
It has to. It's gotta be something.

01:21:38.254 --> 01:21:39.649
We have gotta go back to route 150

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:40.856
and see what's at the end of that road.

01:21:40.857 --> 01:21:42.059
Yeah, but that looks like a dead end.

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.262
Wait a minute.

01:21:47.092 --> 01:21:50.058
Narrow lake is an anagram
for " Nora Walker."

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:00.049
Good luck finding it.

01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:01.293
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.294 --> 01:22:04.051
- Oh. All right.
- Thank you.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.527
- Congratulations, sister-in-law.
- Thank you.

01:22:05.528 --> 01:22:06.729
Bye. Bye.

01:22:06.730 --> 01:22:08.406
Kevin.

01:22:11.275 --> 01:22:14.081
Kevin, please talk to me.

01:22:14.082 --> 01:22:15.824
I don't want to, mom. Not yet.

01:22:17.662 --> 01:22:20.093
I love you.

01:22:20.094 --> 01:22:23.053
I know.

01:22:32.652 --> 01:22:34.345
This can't be it.

01:22:34.346 --> 01:22:38.510
Well, it has to be.
Everything points here.

01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:40.289
There's nothing here.

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:42.704
There's not even a lake.

01:22:42.705 --> 01:22:44.363
I know.

01:22:44.364 --> 01:22:46.274
It does look like an empty piece of land.

01:22:47.698 --> 01:22:49.430
But I'm telling you, Holly,

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.802
I see our future here.
