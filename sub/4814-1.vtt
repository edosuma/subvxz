SIMON: Granted, the craftsmanship's...

03:22.484 --> 03:24.111
not on a par with the Italians...

03:24.152 --> 03:27.485
but for Eastern Europe, it's not bad.

03:29.991 --> 03:32.255
He assures me it's 14th Century...

03:32.293 --> 03:35.353
but these materials, maybe early 15th.

03:35.396 --> 03:37.191
The guy wanted 10,000 for it...

03:37.324 --> 03:38.518
till he found out who was buying.

03:38.559 --> 03:41.619
Then he said Mr. Van Helsing's always been his best customer.

03:41.662 --> 03:44.130
Don't worry. You paid five.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.330
VAN HELSING: Did you translate the markings?

03:48.369 --> 03:51.702
It's a Slav dialect. "All fear he who walks...

03:51.739 --> 03:54.037
"beneath the crown of eternal night."

03:54.074 --> 03:56.065
No, no, no. It's not crown.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.702
It's halo.

03:57.745 --> 04:00.714
"Beneath the halo of eternal night."

04:00.748 --> 04:01.737
SIMON: Oh, well.

04:01.782 --> 04:04.012
You see why the design never survived.

04:04.051 --> 04:05.382
And look how heavy it is compared...

04:05.419 --> 04:06.977
to what they were using in England at the time.

04:07.021 --> 04:10.582
Well, the English made them for firing arrow shafts of wood.

04:10.624 --> 04:14.685
This was made for firing metal-- silver.

[Chuckles]

04:15.896 --> 04:17.692
It sounds like something your grandfather...

04:17.731 --> 04:19.596
would've used to hunt the old...

04:19.632 --> 04:20.622
VAN HELSING: Simon!

04:20.668 --> 04:23.136
You know how I dislike this kind of talk.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.330
Sorry.

04:24.371 --> 04:25.668
VAN HELSING: How my poor grandfather...

04:25.706 --> 04:29.403
could have inspired a character out of Bram Stoker's book...

04:29.443 --> 04:30.740
I'll never know.

04:30.778 --> 04:33.076
In truth, he was simply a country doctor...

04:33.113 --> 04:34.740
VAN HELSING: who built up an antique business.

04:34.782 --> 04:36.079
Nothing more.

04:36.116 --> 04:38.607
SIMON: So, what should we say in terms of resale value?

04:38.652 --> 04:41.348
I am not interested in the resale.

04:41.388 --> 04:42.650
VAN HELSING: I want it for my collection.

04:42.690 --> 04:43.748
Another one.

04:43.791 --> 04:47.158
We turn a profit, do we not?

04:56.237 --> 04:57.761
No, no, no. You go.

04:57.805 --> 04:59.500

05:10.751 --> 05:12.719
We board the next train, and three hours later...

05:12.753 --> 05:14.550
we're in Paris for the weekend.

[Sighs]

05:16.924 --> 05:20.052
Does English charm work on English women?

05:20.094 --> 05:22.062
Why not, Solina? One reason.

05:22.096 --> 05:25.259
I don't date men that I work with.

05:25.299 --> 05:28.063

Yes. My artifacts, textiles, everything that I call my own.

in a manner not quite befitting the scrutiny of the law.

Well, I must tend to this matter myself.

you know why you never had me, Simon?

44:48.200 --> 44:51.829
They can be killed by silver, by sunlight, by stakes.

44:51.870 --> 44:54.532
VAN HELSING: You must pierce their heart or behead them.

44:54.573 --> 44:58.304
They are Nosferatu--vampires.

44:58.343 --> 45:00.538
And you knew this?

45:00.579 --> 45:02.672
And you're all right with this?

45:02.714 --> 45:04.875
I had them destroyed, eradicated...

45:04.917 --> 45:09.047
all but one-- my secret in the abbey.

45:09.088 --> 45:11.522
He is what they stole.

45:11.557 --> 45:13.855
- Who?
- Dracula.

45:17.429 --> 45:20.523
Dracula...not myth...

This is the fucking Twilight Zone.

45:40.219 --> 45:42.084
[Coughing] Wait.

45:42.121 --> 45:45.284
He was the first. Dracula was the first--

45:45.324 --> 45:47.884
the Adam, the patient zero.

45:47.926 --> 45:50.224
VAN HELSING: But unlike those he infected,

45:50.262 --> 45:51.422
he cannot be killed.

45:51.463 --> 45:52.725
There's no way that I know.

45:52.764 --> 45:54.163
What do you mean, can't?

45:54.199 --> 45:55.860
VAN HELSING: For each act that destroys a vampire...

45:55.901 --> 45:59.166
he survives. There has to be a way.

45:59.204 --> 46:02.401
I spent my whole life searching for a way to kill him.

46:02.441 --> 46:04.375

46:04.409 --> 46:08.573
beyond the reach of death, but why?

46:08.614 --> 46:10.514
That is the question that has plagued me...

46:10.549 --> 46:12.016
for over a century.

46:12.050 --> 46:15.577
Who is this creature that walks as a man...

yet casts no reflection?

46:28.634 --> 46:29.862
[Growling]

46:45.617 --> 46:48.711
VAN HELSING: I made a promise a long time ago...

46:48.754 --> 46:51.848
that if Dracula could not die, then nor would I.

46:51.890 --> 46:53.187
I would be his keeper...

46:53.225 --> 46:56.991
for as long as it took to uncover his secret...

46:57.029 --> 47:01.363
to know who he really is...

47:01.400 --> 47:03.834
and somehow find a way to end him.

47:07.172 --> 47:08.571
I used his blood...

47:08.607 --> 47:10.598
filtered through leeches to stay alive...

47:10.642 --> 47:13.440
but I never found the answer, Simon.

47:13.478 --> 47:16.777
Only this--he hates God.

47:16.815 --> 47:19.477
He is repulsed by all things Christian...

47:19.518 --> 47:21.349
but these things do not kill him. No.

47:21.386 --> 47:26.153
They only fill him with a rage that makes him even stronger.

47:27.826 --> 47:29.623
VAN HELSING: Now you know.

47:30.829 --> 47:33.957
No. You judge me as you see fit...

47:33.999 --> 47:37.662
VAN HELSING: but right now we must stop him...

47:37.703 --> 47:40.035
before he gets what he came for.

But he's here by accident. The crash.

Matthew, Abraham, whoever you are...

47:55.487 --> 47:56.954
what else have you never told me?

47:56.989 --> 48:01.221
For the first time, I believe...

48:01.260 --> 48:07.358
that there is someone else in the world like him...

48:07.399 --> 48:11.460
and he senses it. He senses his own blood.

48:27.653 --> 48:31.453
I saw myself kissing him...

48:31.490 --> 48:34.653
and it was as real as I'm sitting here now.

48:35.727 --> 48:37.456
How did you feel?

48:37.496 --> 48:42.297
Scared, but a little bit drawn.

No, no. More than that.

What does he want?

48:55.180 --> 48:57.740
Do you have a sense of that?

48:57.783 --> 49:00.183
He wants me.

He wants my soul.

He wants my soul, David...

and I don't know if I have the strength to fight him.

01:19:44.519 --> 01:19:46.146
No.

01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:48.985
We'll all be lovers soon.

01:19:49.023 --> 01:19:50.547
No. Unh!

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.091
Aah!

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:25.149
You cannot imagine what I've had to endure.

01:20:25.193 --> 01:20:29.129
DRACULA: I have borne the very wrath of God.

01:20:31.899 --> 01:20:36.268
Chosen to suffer like no man before.

01:20:36.304 --> 01:20:38.772
Who are you?

01:20:42.643 --> 01:20:46.044
DRACULA: It was my last sunset on this earth...

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.140
that made me who I am.

01:20:51.285 --> 01:20:53.947
Let me show you...

01:20:53.988 --> 01:20:57.617
what I have shown no other.

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:33.116
[Woman singing]

01:21:39.434 --> 01:21:41.527
Blood of my blood...

01:21:43.538 --> 01:21:46.803
flesh of my flesh.

01:21:51.479 --> 01:21:53.777
[Thunder]

01:22:30.785 --> 01:22:32.582
Judas Iscariot.

01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:37.589
The cross, the silver...

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:40.185
all the things you came to despise.

01:22:54.942 --> 01:22:56.466
[Gasps]

01:23:02.884 --> 01:23:06.411
DRACULA: You knew this would come to pass.

01:23:06.454 --> 01:23:10.083
It was my destiny to betray you...

01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:13.525
because you needed me.

01:23:20.134 --> 01:23:22.398
Now...

01:23:22.436 --> 01:23:26.770
I drink the blood of your children...

01:23:26.807 --> 01:23:29.708
but I give them more than just eternal life.

01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:33.077
I give them what they crave most.

01:23:36.918 --> 01:23:40.445
All the pleasure you would deny them...

01:23:42.056 --> 01:23:43.318
forever.

01:23:46.994 --> 01:23:48.985
[Laughs]

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.367
DRACULA: You made the world in your image...

01:23:56.404 --> 01:23:57.894
but now...

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.731
I make it in mine.

01:24:07.982 --> 01:24:09.609
Come, Mary.

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:12.676
DRACULA: Let us feast.

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:39.672
She's one of us now.

01:24:39.714 --> 01:24:41.204
You can smell it on her.

01:24:41.249 --> 01:24:43.774
We've saved him for you, Mary.

01:24:43.818 --> 01:24:47.276
DRACULA: Show him there is nothing to fear.

01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:51.856
Blood...

01:24:51.892 --> 01:24:55.885
has always been the coin of our realm.

01:25:09.176 --> 01:25:11.736
Save some for us, Mare.

01:25:17.752 --> 01:25:20.653
SIMON: No, Mary, please.

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:24.017
Mary, don't.

01:25:25.426 --> 01:25:27.018
Please.

01:25:29.964 --> 01:25:31.556
Aah! Aah!

01:25:53.454 --> 01:25:55.183
Thanks, Luce.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:59.286
Hey...

01:26:13.441 --> 01:26:15.739
I'd like his head.

01:26:15.776 --> 01:26:19.403
Vampire or not, he won't stop hunting us now.

01:26:26.477 --> 01:26:28.775
He's yours to end.

01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:46.222
Oh, Simon.

01:26:57.007 --> 01:26:58.736
Bitch is faking it.

01:26:58.776 --> 01:26:59.868
No!

01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:05.245
For my father.

01:27:06.450 --> 01:27:07.576
Go!

01:27:23.767 --> 01:27:26.600
You think you can teach me about betrayal?

01:27:50.894 --> 01:27:53.624
Didn't your father ever tell you, Mary?

01:27:53.664 --> 01:27:56.531
I can't die. He won't have me.

01:27:56.567 --> 01:27:57.864
Did you ever ask?

01:27:57.901 --> 01:28:00.267
For what? Forgiveness?

01:28:03.307 --> 01:28:06.470
You really think I'd go back to him? Never!

01:28:12.316 --> 01:28:14.216
[Click]

01:28:14.251 --> 01:28:16.481
[Click]

01:28:22.893 --> 01:28:24.190
Ahh!

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:33.165
- He still loves you.
- Does he?

01:28:33.203 --> 01:28:35.296
DRACULA: Just as he still loves you?

01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:37.307
Then go back to him...

01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:38.899
and see if he'll still have you!

01:28:43.113 --> 01:28:44.273
Unh!

01:28:46.683 --> 01:28:47.877
Aah!

01:28:55.959 --> 01:28:57.256
Simon.

01:28:57.294 --> 01:28:59.057
Better make it good.

01:28:59.096 --> 01:29:01.155
You and I, we could--

01:29:01.198 --> 01:29:02.358
No!

01:29:25.722 --> 01:29:27.622
SIMON: Aah!

01:29:35.232 --> 01:29:37.132
This is how you die.

01:29:46.677 --> 01:29:48.440
Ohh! Uhh!

01:30:00.524 --> 01:30:02.788
[Gasping]

01:30:02.826 --> 01:30:05.090
[Choking]

01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:35.580
Uhh!

01:30:45.969 --> 01:30:47.994
[Choking]

01:30:50.173 --> 01:30:51.834
[Gasps]

01:30:51.875 --> 01:30:53.775
I...

01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:59.544
DRACULA: release...you.

01:31:02.052 --> 01:31:03.815
[Woman singing]

01:31:20.203 --> 01:31:21.465
Aah!

01:31:31.648 --> 01:31:33.775
SIMON: Mary!

01:31:33.817 --> 01:31:34.875
Mary!

01:32:08.318 --> 01:32:10.149
MARY: Long ago, Judas Iscariot...

01:32:10.187 --> 01:32:12.621
tried to die for his sins...

01:32:12.656 --> 01:32:14.487
but he was denied.

01:32:14.524 --> 01:32:16.958
Today, the rope did not break...

01:32:16.994 --> 01:32:20.452
and he was burned in the first light of dawn.

01:32:20.497 --> 01:32:23.398
I am now the keeper of what remains.

01:32:23.433 --> 01:32:26.231
If the soul of Dracula still flickers in his ashes...

01:32:26.269 --> 01:32:29.261
I will keep it forever contained.

01:32:30.841 --> 01:32:34.368
For the first time in my life, I know who I am...

01:32:34.411 --> 01:32:37.346
and where my future lies.

01:32:37.381 --> 01:32:39.713
I am Mary Van Helsing.

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:42.184
I am my father's daughter...

01:32:42.219 --> 01:32:44.710
and nothing can ever take that away.

01:32:44.755 --> 01:32:47.315
[Thunder]

01:33:06.207 --> 01:33:11.144
SINGING: I cannot take this anymore

01:33:11.179 --> 01:33:15.548
Saying everything I've said before

01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:18.143
All these words, they make no sense

01:33:18.186 --> 01:33:20.620
I found bliss in ignorance

01:33:20.655 --> 01:33:23.123
The less I hear, the less you say

01:33:23.157 --> 01:33:26.388
You'll find that out anyway

01:33:26.427 --> 01:33:29.794
Just like before

01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:31.799
Everything you say to me

01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.698
Takes me one step closer to the edge

01:33:33.735 --> 01:33:35.134
And I'm about to break

01:33:35.169 --> 01:33:36.796
I need a little room to breathe

01:33:36.838 --> 01:33:38.806
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.273
And I'm about to break

01:33:40.308 --> 01:33:45.075
I find the answers aren't so clear

01:33:45.113 --> 01:33:49.675
Wish I could find a way to disappear

01:33:49.717 --> 01:33:52.311
All these thoughts, they make no sense

01:33:52.353 --> 01:33:54.844
I found bliss in ignorance

01:33:54.889 --> 01:33:57.255
Nothing seems to go away

01:33:57.292 --> 01:34:00.420
Over and over again

01:34:00.461 --> 01:34:03.828
Just like before

01:34:03.865 --> 01:34:05.765
Everything you say to me

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.700
Takes me one step closer to the edge

01:34:07.735 --> 01:34:09.134
And I'm about to break

01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:10.933
I need a little room to breathe

01:34:10.972 --> 01:34:12.803
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.966
And I'm about to

01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:17.609
Shout

01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.944
Heavy

01:34:26.988 --> 01:34:28.319
You want it heavy

01:34:28.356 --> 01:34:29.789
Welcome to my world

01:34:29.824 --> 01:34:32.019
Feel the weight of it grinding down

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.051
And heavy

01:34:34.095 --> 01:34:35.289
I want it heavy

01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:36.854
Welcome to my world

01:34:36.898 --> 01:34:41.801
Feel the weight of it grinding down again

01:34:44.072 --> 01:34:46.870
Shook off

01:34:46.908 --> 01:34:48.876
Gather your pathetic masses

01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:50.207
And bring them to me

01:34:50.244 --> 01:34:52.303
To a world devoid of light

01:34:52.347 --> 01:34:55.578
To another time, to another place

01:34:55.617 --> 01:34:58.586
And then the broken ones taste my misery

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.248
Rip away the disguise, and you will realize

01:35:01.289 --> 01:35:03.985
That you find the truth is sickening

01:35:04.025 --> 01:35:07.017
We don't need to change it, really

01:35:07.061 --> 01:35:10.758
I kind of like it ugly

01:35:10.798 --> 01:35:12.789
Lay

01:35:12.834 --> 01:35:14.358
It

01:35:14.402 --> 01:35:16.267
Make

01:35:16.304 --> 01:35:18.295
It binding

01:35:18.339 --> 01:35:20.204
Seething

01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:21.936
Blinding

01:35:21.976 --> 01:35:23.568
Screaming

01:35:23.611 --> 01:35:25.238
Heavy

01:35:25.279 --> 01:35:26.712
You want it heavy

01:35:26.748 --> 01:35:28.978
Welcome to my world, grinding down

01:35:29.017 --> 01:35:30.814
And heavy

01:35:30.852 --> 01:35:32.410
I want it heavy

01:35:32.453 --> 01:35:35.013
Feel the weight of it grinding

01:35:35.056 --> 01:35:36.546
Heavy

01:35:36.591 --> 01:35:39.355
You want it heavy

01:35:39.394 --> 01:35:42.124
You want it heavy

01:35:42.163 --> 01:35:43.824
You want it heavy
