00:02.003 --> 00:03.868
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:04.714 --> 00:06.295
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.002
It's like you're immune.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.883
- They're not gonna split us apart.
- Not us.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.043
Two's not enough for Derek.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.213
I know he needs at least three.
So who's next?

00:15.391 --> 00:17.473
Why does there have to be a next
when we've already got you?

00:17.643 --> 00:18.974
I'm not part of your pack.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.238
They're coming back, so we
don't have much time to talk.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.654
- What is that?
- Rubbing alcohol.

00:39.832 --> 00:42.744
You don't want it
to get infected, do you?

00:42.919 --> 00:46.878
You will heal the same,
just not as quickly, because of Derek.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.880
Okay, how do you know all this?

00:50.384 --> 00:53.592
- Actually, how do you know anything?
- It's a longer story.

00:53.763 --> 00:57.255
What I can tell you, is that
I know about your kind.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.344
Your kind...

01:00.645 --> 01:01.885
I can help.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.429
But this...

01:05.441 --> 01:07.147
This is something different.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.478
- Well, do you know what did it?
- No. But the Argents will.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.146
And this is the crucial part:

01:13.324 --> 01:15.610
They'll have some kind of record or book.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.944
lt'll have descriptions,
histories, notations,

01:20.122 --> 01:23.535
- of all of the things they've discovered.
- All the things?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.787
How many different things are there?

01:36.597 --> 01:40.636
I'm starting to think I need to buy
a more prominent "closed" sign.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.062
Hello, Alan.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.853
It's been a while.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.818
The last I heard,
you had retired.

01:53.072 --> 01:56.109
Last I heard,
you followed a code of conduct.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.192
If you hadn't noticed,
this body is one of ours.

01:59.579 --> 02:03.367
I did, I also noticed the gunpowder
residue on his finger tips.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.033
So don't assume I'll be
swayed by your philosophy

02:07.211 --> 02:08.997
just 'cause I'll
answer a few questions.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.749
He was only 24.

02:12.174 --> 02:15.041
Killers come in all ages.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.469
All ages, sizes, shapes.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.504
It's the last one
that concerns us.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.557
How about you tell us
what you found?

02:28.899 --> 02:31.276
See this cut?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.771
Precise.
Almost surgical.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.354
But this isn't the wound
that killed him.

02:36.574 --> 02:39.862
This had a more
interesting purpose.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.778
- Relating to the spine?
- That's right.

02:43.956 --> 02:47.448
Whatever made this cut,
it's laced with a paralytic toxin

02:47.668 --> 02:51.206
potent enough to disable
all motor functions.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.583
These are the cause of death.
Notice the patterns on each side?

02:56.761 --> 02:59.343
- Five for each finger.
- Each claw.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.891
As you can see, it dug in,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.557
slashed upward,
eviscerating the lungs

03:05.728 --> 03:08.640
and slicing through the bone
of the rib cage with ease.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.806
- Have you seen anything like this before?
- No.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.358
Any idea at all what killed him?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.895
No. But I can tell you
it's fast, remarkably strong,

03:18.115 --> 03:23.280
and has the capacity to render its victims
essentially helpless within seconds.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.828
If you're saying
we should be cautious,

03:25.998 --> 03:27.374
we get it.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.575
I'm saying
you should be afraid.

03:30.795 --> 03:32.035
Be very afraid.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.456
Because in the natural world,
predators with paralytic toxins

03:36.634 --> 03:39.250
use them to catch and eat their prey.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.840
This prey wasn't eaten.

03:42.014 --> 03:46.553
That means whatever killed him
only wanted to kill him.

03:46.769 --> 03:51.354
In fact, killing may be
its only purpose.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.942
What do you think you're doing?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.243
All I needed was a starter.

04:06.455 --> 04:10.414
Yeah, but it looks like your whole
exhaust system's gotta be replaced too.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.623
Why do | get the feeling
you're slightly overestimating the damage?

04:14.839 --> 04:18.047
It's probably gonna run you around,
like, 1,200, parts and labor.

04:18.217 --> 04:21.709
Are you kidding? This thing
doesn't even have a catalytic converter.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.503
And, yes, I know what
a catalytic converter is.

04:24.724 --> 04:27.636
Do you know what a
limited slip differential is?

04:28.519 --> 04:30.134
No.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.596
Yeah, could run you more, like, 1,500.

04:34.108 --> 04:37.020
Okay. Just finish.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.146
I'll be back here...
seething with impotent rage.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.319
Nice. Real sanitary.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.451
Quality establishment
you're running here.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.336
Figures.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.308
What the...

06:07.868 --> 06:09.028
Help me!

06:25.678 --> 06:26.758
Help!

06:30.015 --> 06:31.095
Help!

06:31.267 --> 06:34.930
Help me!

06:39.108 --> 06:40.393
No!

06:54.790 --> 06:56.872
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.806
I didn't mean to scare you.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.971
It's okay, I was just...

08:03.484 --> 08:06.191
- Expecting someone else?
- Yeah...

08:06.362 --> 08:09.069
I mean, no. No, definitely not.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.780
Good.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.864
Then we can talk for a minute.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.055
Thanks. Don't want to drop that.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.981
I'd be lost without it.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.937
When I was your age,
I didn't even take vitamins.

08:51.115 --> 08:55.154
Now, I'm choking down
a cocktail of pills three times a day!

08:59.123 --> 09:03.992
But, I do what my doctor tells me,
because I trust him.

09:06.338 --> 09:10.251
Trust is a commodity our family
holds very high, you know?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.716
And my daughter,
well, your aunt Kate,

09:16.932 --> 09:19.344
died doing what she thought was right.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.721
Her intentions may have
been a bit misguided.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.476
A bit?

09:23.689 --> 09:25.771
I like that.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.690
You remind me of her.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.858
She challenged me too.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.487
Is that what you want me to do?
Challenge you?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.575
I want you to trust me.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.947
You're gonna find yourself
put in the position

09:39.121 --> 09:41.578
where you question the trust
of people close to you.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.956
Even your closest friends.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.368
And when that happens,
you have to know

09:47.546 --> 09:50.208
the trust you
never question is family.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.925
Can I trust you, Allison?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.342
- Yeah.
- Not "yeah"!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.507
Speak with conviction!

10:01.685 --> 10:03.892
Yes or no?

10:06.565 --> 10:07.520
Yes!

10:09.234 --> 10:10.644
You can trust me.

10:11.487 --> 10:15.105
I told you, ljust walked in and I saw
the jeep on top of the guy, that's all.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.489
What's wrong with your hand?

10:18.160 --> 10:20.071
Nothing.
Can I just get out of here now?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.696
Look, if there's something you
don't think you can tell me...

10:23.874 --> 10:26.661
- You think I'm lying?
- No, of course not.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.709
I'm just worried about you.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.087
Now, if you saw someone do this,

10:32.257 --> 10:34.248
and if you're afraid that maybe
they're gonna come back

10:34.426 --> 10:36.508
and make sure you
don't say anything about it...

10:38.263 --> 10:39.764
I didn't see anything.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.051
At all.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.057
Can I go now, please?

10:47.523 --> 10:50.014
Sure.
But not your jeep.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.860
We're gonna have to impound it.
Sorry, kid, evidence.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.691
I'll see you at home.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.316
Right, well at least
make sure they wash it.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.535
Scott?

11:35.988 --> 11:38.070
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.366
You were right.
It's not like you.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.241
Its eyes were almost... reptilian.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.831
But there was something about them.

11:50.919 --> 11:51.908
What do you mean?

11:52.129 --> 11:55.496
You know when you see, like,
a friend in a Halloween mask,

11:55.674 --> 11:58.131
but all you can actually see
are their eyes,

11:58.302 --> 12:01.510
and you feel like you know them,
but you just can't figure it out who it is?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.591
Are you saying
you know who it is?

12:03.807 --> 12:04.887
No.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.799
But I think it knew me.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.514
Does anyone want to try
not being completely predictable?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.068
That's the last time you do that.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.283
Why, 'cause I am a Beta?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.824
No. Because I have someone
else in mind for you.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.209
Are we done?

13:16.713 --> 13:20.501
I got about 100 bones that
need a few hours to heal.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.676
Here?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.392
101.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.642
You think I'm teaching you
how to fight? Huh?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.105
Look at me!

13:34.314 --> 13:36.930
I'm teaching you
how to survive!

13:44.741 --> 13:47.073
If they wanted us dead,
why aren't they coming for us now?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.071
What are they waiting for?

13:49.955 --> 13:51.195
I don't know.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.740
But they're planning something.
And you, especially,

13:54.918 --> 13:57.159
know that's not our only problem.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.661
Whatever that thing is
that killed Isaac's father,

13:59.840 --> 14:02.172
I think it killed
someone else last night.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.301
Until I find out what it is, you all
need to learn everything that I know.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.548
As fast as I can teach you.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.897
Time to get up.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.022
Go away.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.275
You're going to be late for your
appointment with the school counselor.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.107
Remember, we have a deal.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.272
Remember, I told you l was fine.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.656
Lydia, please...

14:29.494 --> 14:31.530
What did you do?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.287
Oh, my God,
what did you do to yourself?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.996
Lydia, sweetheart.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.339
Why did you do that?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.049
Lydia.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.092
- Nice gloves.
- Thank you.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.639
So, what's your brand of psychosis?

14:57.647 --> 14:58.636
Really?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.265
We're both here for something.
We don't have to be ashamed of it.

15:03.070 --> 15:07.109
l have an acute phobia of people
prying into my personal life.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.530
You?

15:10.619 --> 15:14.282
Compulsively drawn to
cute but narcissistic girls.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.201
Are you ready, Lydia?

15:23.632 --> 15:25.668
I'm so sorry about the other day.

15:25.884 --> 15:26.999
I'm trying.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.339
We'll get through this.

15:29.513 --> 15:32.175
Uh, I know, because I love you.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.099
I love you more than...
Oh, my God!

15:36.269 --> 15:37.930
You and Allison just have to find
a better way to communicate.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.311
Come on!

15:39.523 --> 15:41.764
You're the only one that we can trust.
Is she coming to the game tonight?

15:41.942 --> 15:44.479
Yes, okay? Message complete.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.523
All right, now,
tell me about your boss?

15:48.073 --> 15:51.361
He thinks that Allison's family
keep some kind of records

15:51.576 --> 15:53.988
of all the things that they've hunted.
Like a book.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.319
He probably means a bestiary.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.409
- What?
- A bestiary.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.038
I think you mean bestiality.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.915
Nope, pretty sure I don't.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.713
It's like an encyclopedia
of mythical creatures.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.421
How am | the only one that doesn't seem
to know anything about this stuff?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.677
Okay, you know, you're my best friend,
you're a creature of the night.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.006
- It's kind of like a priority of mine.
- Okay.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.093
If we can find it, and it can
tell us what this thing is...

16:19.271 --> 16:20.260
And who.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.555
- We need that book!
- We need that book!

16:25.819 --> 16:27.901
You're not even French, are you?

16:28.697 --> 16:30.028
French-Canadian.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.277
Which means you're a Canadian
who speaks French.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.944
And seeing as I'm placing
my mental health in your hands,

16:37.122 --> 16:39.659
how about you tell me what,
as a French teacher,

16:39.875 --> 16:41.490
qualifies you to be
a guidance counselor?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.954
l have a masters in
behavioral psychology,

16:44.171 --> 16:46.628
and have done
over 300 hours of field work.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.797
Ca va bien.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.173
If you're really fine,
what are you doing here?

16:54.806 --> 16:57.764
Appeasing my parents
so they don't take away my car keys.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.471
Have you talked to your friends
about what happened to you?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.977
Yeah, they're great.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.479
Totally supportive.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.648
Do you trust them?

17:07.819 --> 17:08.808
lmplicitly.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.104
Good. But still be cautious.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.610
Why? Because sometimes
people closest to you

17:14.826 --> 17:17.363
can be the ones
holding you back the most?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.070
Indeed.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.906
Did you read that somewhere?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.416
I don't know.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.506
Maybe I heard it.

17:28.673 --> 17:32.757
Well, sounds like whoever
said it left an impression.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.096
- Hey, I need to see if you can
brighten the resolution on this. - Sure.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.928
Whatever you find,

17:41.102 --> 17:43.434
you need to keep it to yourself.
Got it?

17:43.647 --> 17:44.807
What's on it?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.768
It's just me in my room...

17:47.984 --> 17:50.896
- in bed.
- I'm supposed to watch you in bed?

17:51.112 --> 17:54.240
You remember all the times
I told you you're not my type?

17:54.449 --> 17:55.950
Just do it.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.244
Oh, and FYI...

17:59.704 --> 18:01.820
I'm everyone's type.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.913
- I think you mean...
- No, I mean bestiary.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.548
And the two of you, I don't want to
know what's going on in your heads.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.627
Okay. Can you describe this thing?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.888
It's probably, like, a book. Old, worn...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.091
Like, bound in leather?

18:25.855 --> 18:28.983
Yes. Seen her grandfather
with a book like that.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.938
Where does he keep it?

18:39.244 --> 18:43.283
She says it has to be office.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.582
Drug dealers have been using disposable
cell phones pretty successfully for years.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.289
My parents check every call,
email and text message | send.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.630
- Trust me, they'd find it.
- All right. Can you get the book?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.419
Not without his keys.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.806
I need to warn you, by the way.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.139
You might need to be
a little patient with me.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.845
- How come?
- I'll probably have a lot of questions,

19:09.065 --> 19:12.228
seeing as I've never actually
seen a lacrosse game before.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.329
What the hell is this?
Dude, I thought I could trust you.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.701
Relax, it's my camera, okay?
He just needed to ask me some questions.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.332
- Matt's the one who found it anyway.
- Found what?

19:32.255 --> 19:33.290
There.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.625
There, what?

19:34.799 --> 19:37.711
It's an edit point.
It's been looped. Two hours' worth.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.674
- What does that mean?
- That means there's two hours of footage...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.054
missing.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.362
Come on!
Is that thing even a teenager?

19:59.574 --> 20:02.031
I wanna see a birth certificate!

20:02.243 --> 20:05.576
Who or what is that
genetic experiment gone wrong?

20:05.747 --> 20:07.908
Eddie Obomowitz, Coach.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.955
They call him "The Abomination."

20:10.126 --> 20:11.536
Oh, that's cute.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.165
McCall. What the hell
are you waiting for?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.714
This is the semi-finals.
Bring that roid-head into the ground.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.045
Me? You're the one who said
that l was a cheater.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.427
And that freak of nature
being on the field is fair?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.254
- Do something.
- I can't.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.093
Not while Allison's grandfather is here.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.356
I knew I should have brought
a warmer jacket.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.267
You're cold. Here, take my coat.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.525
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.861
Here.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.656
Put that on you. All right?

21:03.221 --> 21:05.633
Good God!
Is it always this violent?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.353
I can't feel my legs.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.571
- He belong to you?
- No, mine is still on the field.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.196
While I'm here really wishing
that he would have stuck with tennis.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.954
Are you the yearbook photographer?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.161
No, ljust take pictures.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.371
Just lacrosse or other things?

21:37.672 --> 21:39.333
Anything that catches my eye.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.191
Hey, Lydia, what's wrong?

22:00.361 --> 22:02.613
- Lydia, come...
- Just go away.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.235
- What's wrong?
- Look, I don't need anyone seeing me cry.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.320
Oh, come on, Lydia.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.537
Look, you shouldn't care if
people see you cry, all right?

22:12.707 --> 22:13.947
Especially you.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.373
Why?

22:18.421 --> 22:21.584
Because I think you look
really beautiful when you cry.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.384
How many fingers
am I holding up?

22:30.725 --> 22:32.681
- Four?
- Say two.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.141
Two?

22:34.312 --> 22:37.725
Perfect. Get out there. Come on!
Get out there and have a stick.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.432
You're still short
one player, Coach!

22:40.652 --> 22:42.188
Where's Stilinski?

22:42.403 --> 22:43.813
Where's Stilinski?

22:47.826 --> 22:49.691
You! You!

22:49.953 --> 22:51.659
You play lacrosse?

22:52.580 --> 22:55.196
Uh-uh. Derek won't like this.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.291
Yeah, but I will.

23:00.839 --> 23:01.919
Yeah!

23:04.092 --> 23:05.707
We got ourselves a player!

23:07.220 --> 23:09.006
You're gonna think I am crazy.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.297
Lydia, if you trust me on anything,
you can trust me on this.

23:12.517 --> 23:16.430
There is nothing that you can say to me
that will make you sound crazy.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.515
Literally nothing.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.398
Can you just give me five minutes?

23:26.281 --> 23:29.444
I know, I'm sorry, just...
But just stay here.

23:29.659 --> 23:34.153
Continue crying or not crying if you want,
or whatever works for you.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.033
But just stay here
and I'll be right back, okay?

23:36.207 --> 23:39.449
And then we can talk.
About anything. Yeah?

23:40.128 --> 23:41.834
Okay, just five minutes.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.132
Book, book, book.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.215
There's no book.

23:57.854 --> 24:01.017
Nothing here.

24:02.817 --> 24:03.772
Oh!

24:04.360 --> 24:05.520
Hello, Stiles.

24:28.217 --> 24:28.876
Yeah!

24:31.304 --> 24:33.670
The bigger they are...

24:33.890 --> 24:36.973
the bigger they are!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.709
Ah. Yeah.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.086
- Stiles.
- Derek.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.462
What did you see
at the mechanic's garage?

25:12.470 --> 25:16.634
Several alarming EPA violations
that I'm seriously considering reporting.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.018
Holy God.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.729
Let's try that again.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.105
Yeah!

25:37.745 --> 25:41.454
You need to get off the field.
Your eyes... Someone's gonna see you.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.875
Give it to McCall!
Give it to McCall!

25:51.884 --> 25:53.044
Scott, go!

25:53.261 --> 25:54.592
Go, Scott, go!

26:10.903 --> 26:12.313
Oh, my God.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.773
I'm fine, I'm healing. It's okay.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.278
The book!

26:18.453 --> 26:20.819
It's not in his office.
It's gotta be at the house.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.912
Scott, your leg.
Oh, my God, your leg is broken.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.038
Not for long.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.159
- Don't move.
- Scott...

26:28.379 --> 26:30.415
It's okay, it's okay.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.456
I'm fine, I'm fine.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.002
I could have sworn I literally
heard bone breaking from where I sat.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.304
- Heard it? I felt it.
- Seriously, guys, I'm fine.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.890
- We should go.
- Hold on.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.098
I wanna ask him one more thing.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.140
All right, the thing
was pretty slick-looking.

26:51.069 --> 26:54.687
Skin was dark.
Kind of patterned.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.567
I think I actually saw scales.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.357
Is that enough?

26:59.577 --> 27:02.865
Okay? 'Cause l have somebody
I really need to talk to.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.451
All right, fine. Eyes.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.332
Eyes are...

27:09.045 --> 27:12.378
yellowish and slitted.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.375
It has a lot of teeth.
Oh, and it's got a tail, too.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.548
Are we good?

27:22.308 --> 27:23.343
What?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.470
Have you seen it?

27:25.686 --> 27:28.894
You have this look on your faces like you
know exactly what I'm talking about.

27:40.451 --> 27:41.531
Run!

27:43.788 --> 27:45.324
Derek, your neck.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.374
Come on. Come here.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.337
Where is it? Can you see it?

27:55.508 --> 27:57.123
No, just hurry.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.962
Call Scott!

28:02.181 --> 28:03.557
Stiles, you son of a...

28:17.238 --> 28:18.694
Where did it go?

28:20.074 --> 28:21.530
Where is it? Do you see it?

28:22.493 --> 28:23.699
No.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.444
Okay, maybe it took off.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.293
Maybe not.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.628
Oh, good, you're back.
Dinner's almost ready.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.250
How was the game?

28:37.425 --> 28:39.757
Why don't you ask
the star player?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.660
All right.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.202
Why is everyone so quiet?

29:15.129 --> 29:17.916
Is it that uncomfortable
that they dated?

29:19.592 --> 29:21.924
Did you ask them if
they'd be uncomfortable?

29:22.386 --> 29:26.220
Okay, I know it's been a
few centuries since I was a teenager,

29:26.390 --> 29:30.133
but even back then,
we dated and broke up all the time.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.680
We're fine.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.262
Right, Scott?

29:35.650 --> 29:37.015
Totally fine.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.649
Then why did you break up?

29:44.575 --> 29:46.861
She... dumped me?

29:53.376 --> 29:56.493
- Will you get me out of here before I drown?
- You're worried about drowning?

29:56.712 --> 30:00.045
Did you notice the thing out there
with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth?

30:00.258 --> 30:03.842
Did you notice that I'm paralyzed
from the neck down in eight feet of water?

30:04.011 --> 30:05.126
Okay.

30:07.098 --> 30:08.838
I don't see it.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.806
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.982
What's it waiting for?

30:26.951 --> 30:28.907
No offense, Scott.

30:29.078 --> 30:34.448
But I think maybe Allison felt
the two of you were just growing apart.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.500
As if the father's
opinion isn't biased.

30:37.670 --> 30:41.504
How do you know they weren't
as passionate as Romeo and Juliet?

30:41.882 --> 30:45.374
Romeo and Juliet
committed ritual suicide.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.721
They could have used
a little less passion.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.880
Can we please talk about
something else?

30:51.100 --> 30:52.886
Brilliant idea.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.389
Scott?

30:58.274 --> 31:01.186
How about you help me
grab desert from the kitchen?

31:09.327 --> 31:12.535
Do I need to fill you in on the details
of what would happen to you

31:12.747 --> 31:14.157
if he found out what we all know?

31:14.332 --> 31:17.244
I'm kind of wondering
what would happen to you, actually.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.248
Well, it wouldn't be very good for me.

31:22.465 --> 31:25.673
But then, I'd have plenty of chances
to redeem myself.

31:26.135 --> 31:29.298
And that... wouldn't be good for you.

31:53.371 --> 31:54.781
Wait, do you see that?

31:55.331 --> 31:57.196
I don't think it can swim.

32:00.211 --> 32:01.542
Do you mind if we are excused?

32:01.712 --> 32:04.829
There's actually some notes from English
I need to go over with Scott.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.877
I'm not so sure it's appropriate.

32:08.094 --> 32:12.303
Okay, I'm the one that's
supposed to be old-fashioned here.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.088
The two of you, go.

32:27.321 --> 32:28.686
Come here. Come here.

32:32.243 --> 32:33.323
Hurry!

32:46.674 --> 32:48.414
There goes that plan.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.550
Wait. Actually...

32:53.222 --> 32:55.053
Let me try something.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.602
Oh, my God.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.105
Do you wanna hit a few banks later?

33:22.251 --> 33:24.913
"Salmon moutarde creme fraiche"?

33:25.129 --> 33:27.415
- What is this?
- A recipe.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.630
It's a cookbook.

33:34.263 --> 33:37.300
Two days to prepare.
But worth it.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.610
Okay.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.314
Okay, I don't think
I can do this much longer.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.235
No, no, no!
Don't even think about it.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.449
- Could you just trust me this once?
- No!

34:01.665 --> 34:04.156
I'm the one keeping you alive, okay?
Have you noticed that?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.583
Yeah. And when the paralysis wears off,

34:06.754 --> 34:08.745
who's gonna be able to fight that thing,
you or me?

34:08.923 --> 34:11.130
That's why I've been holding you up
for the past two hours?

34:11.300 --> 34:13.962
Yup. You don't trust me.
I don't trust you.

34:14.887 --> 34:19.176
But you need me to survive,
which is why you're not letting me go.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.055
Stiles!

35:10.359 --> 35:12.975
- Shut it off. Shut it off.
- I know, I'm sorry.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.573
- Scott!
- I can't talk right now.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.592
Tell me you got him!

35:43.392 --> 35:45.348
Without it, we have
no idea what this thing is.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.384
Where else do we look?

35:47.563 --> 35:49.303
What haven't we thought of?

35:50.065 --> 35:52.181
I don't know,
maybe it's not a book.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.855
Something else
he keeps close to him.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.241
I know where it is.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.710
Principal Argent. Gerard.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.293
Mr. and Mrs. argent,
thank you for dinner.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.375
| just realized that l have to
pick up my mom from work.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.969
I don't get it.
What's not to like?

36:40.783 --> 36:43.195
Stiles, where are you?
I need Gerard's keys.

36:43.369 --> 36:46.452
There's a USB drive on it.
That's the bestiary.

36:58.092 --> 37:01.380
I can't stay up any longer.
I need something to hold on to.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.624
Is that even a language?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.707
How are we supposed to
figure out what this thing is?

38:19.882 --> 38:21.622
It's called a Kanima.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.543
- You knew the whole time.
- No.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.803
Only when it was confused
by its own reflection.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.475
- It doesn't know what it is.
- Or who.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.383
What else do you know?

38:32.603 --> 38:35.345
Just stories. Rumors.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.932
But it's like us?

38:37.149 --> 38:40.858
It's a shape-shifter, yes.
But it's not right.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.564
It's like a...

38:43.781 --> 38:45.692
An abomination.

38:51.413 --> 38:52.619
Derek!

38:53.040 --> 38:56.749
We need to work together on this.
Maybe even tell the Argents?

38:56.960 --> 39:00.544
- You trust them?
- Nobody trusts anyone!

39:01.423 --> 39:03.288
That's the problem.

39:03.467 --> 39:06.129
While we're here, arguing
about who's on what side,

39:06.345 --> 39:09.303
there's something scarier,
stronger and faster than any of us,

39:09.473 --> 39:10.929
and it's killing people!

39:11.099 --> 39:12.964
And we still don't even know
anything about it!

39:14.978 --> 39:16.969
I know one thing.
When I find it...

39:18.148 --> 39:19.684
I'm gonna kill it!

39:29.993 --> 39:31.779
Don't move.

39:32.329 --> 39:37.073
Even though I can practically feel the tissue
around the blade already trying to heal,

39:37.251 --> 39:39.958
you never know with a Beta.

39:40.671 --> 39:42.127
Besides,

39:42.339 --> 39:45.206
we'd lose this perfect picture.

39:45.425 --> 39:50.215
The kind old grandfather
embracing his favorite grandson

39:50.430 --> 39:53.422
after hearing good news
from the doctor.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.884
That's right.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.020
I can play the nice,
doddering grandpa

40:00.190 --> 40:05.480
who likes to cook and tell stories
and be sweet and charming.

40:05.696 --> 40:06.902
And trust me,

40:07.072 --> 40:12.658
I can do it far better than you playing
average broken-hearted teenage boy!

40:13.912 --> 40:14.901
Are you listening?

40:15.539 --> 40:17.871
- Yes.
- Perfect.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.450
Now, you're gonna do me a favor
one of these days.

40:21.670 --> 40:26.039
And you're gonna do it because
if you don't, this knife goes in her.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.595
Scott?

40:31.555 --> 40:35.093
I truly believe
that it's so much easier

40:35.309 --> 40:38.767
when bad things
don't have to happen to good people.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.857
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

40:49.323 --> 40:50.859
Hey there.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.319
You okay?

40:53.493 --> 40:55.074
Yeah, fine.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.739
Everything's fine.
