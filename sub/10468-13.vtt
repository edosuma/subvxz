WEBVTT

00:04.119 --> 00:06.857
I GOT TO GET THESE CARROTS
TO BALANCE OUT.

00:07.375 --> 00:10.243
ALEX THINKS IT'S MAYBE WHY
OUR PROFITS ARE SO FAR DOWN.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.471
I MEAN, NOTHING AGAINST YOU,
MAN, YOU KNOW.

00:13.946 --> 00:17.339
BUSINESS IS WHAT IT IS, AND THIS PROGRAM
GETS KIND OF BUGGY SOMETIMES.

00:17.359 --> 00:18.979
WELL, ME AND COMPUTERS.

00:19.009 --> 00:20.991
IT'S THE ONLY MATCH WORSE
THAN ME AND FRANNY.

00:21.019 --> 00:22.150
WAIT A SECOND.

00:22.883 --> 00:24.204
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

00:25.210 --> 00:28.119
ALL THESE EXPENSES
THAT GOT ENTERED IN.

00:28.139 --> 00:30.401
SOMEHOW THEY
GOT CHARGED TWICE.

00:31.609 --> 00:33.032
ALL OF THESE...

00:33.289 --> 00:34.302
WHICH IS...

00:35.699 --> 00:36.731
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:36.731 --> 00:39.647
EVERY DEBIT HAS TO BE ENTERED
INDIVIDUALLY.

00:39.647 --> 00:40.769
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:41.029 --> 00:42.747
LET ME SAVE YOU SOME TIME.

00:44.347 --> 00:46.432
THE REASON
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

00:46.779 --> 00:48.264
IT WOULD NEVER
OCCUR TO YOU.

00:49.570 --> 00:50.597
WHAT?

00:51.079 --> 00:54.205
THAT A GUY YOU TRUST
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:55.271 --> 00:56.603
WHAT, JOE, WHAT...

00:56.884 --> 00:58.636
YOU'RE SCARING ME HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:59.081 --> 01:00.234
FIRST THING
YOU GOT TO KNOW, BAILEY,

01:00.259 --> 01:02.104
IS THAT YOU'RE
GONNA GET IT ALL BACK.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.453
EVERY CENT.

01:04.679 --> 01:06.461
- OH, MY GOD.
- IT'S A SHORT-TERM JAM.

01:06.508 --> 01:07.588
I'LL DIG MYSELF OUT OF IT.

01:07.588 --> 01:08.589
JOE...

01:09.254 --> 01:10.737
HOW MUCH?
HOW MUCH MONEY?

01:10.749 --> 01:12.969
WELL, JUST ADD UP
ALL THE DOUBLE EXPENSES.

01:13.009 --> 01:14.369
I--I DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE NUMBER.

01:14.379 --> 01:16.021
I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

01:17.579 --> 01:18.626
WHAT DID YOU...

01:20.209 --> 01:21.362
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

01:21.379 --> 01:23.038
WHAT KIND OF JAM
ARE YOU IN?

01:23.929 --> 01:25.470
DIVORCE IS EXPENSIVE,
BAILEY.

01:25.489 --> 01:27.439
I HAD A MOUNTAIN
OF LEGAL BILLS.

01:27.949 --> 01:29.049
WHAT, SO YOU...

01:29.049 --> 01:31.263
YOU TOOK MONEY
FROM US TO PAY THEM?

01:31.289 --> 01:32.978
I HAD A BETTER IDEA.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.369
THIS MARKET, MAN...

01:37.369 --> 01:38.874
SOMETIMES YOU WATCH IT,

01:38.889 --> 01:41.269
AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S THINKING.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.229
I MEAN, LIKE THE MONEY IS
THERE WAITING TO BE TAKEN.

01:44.259 --> 01:46.891
WAIT--WAIT, WHAT,
THE STOCK MARKET?

01:46.939 --> 01:49.630
IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS,
I WAS NOTHING BUT UP.

01:49.630 --> 01:52.604
BUT THESE OPTIONS,
THEY EXPIRE, MAN.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.069
OK, ENOUGH, ENOUGH, JOE.

01:54.069 --> 01:55.791
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS, OK?

01:57.812 --> 02:00.148
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
OH!

02:00.479 --> 02:02.091
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO HERE?

02:03.019 --> 02:04.269
THIS MONEY...

02:04.289 --> 02:05.958
WE NEED THIS MONEY!

02:07.209 --> 02:08.381
YOU WANT ME TO TELL
THE FAMILY?

02:08.388 --> 02:10.053
I MEAN, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE STUCK
WITH THAT YOURSELF.

02:10.059 --> 02:12.252
NO. NO. FORGET THAT.

02:13.579 --> 02:14.809
THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH TO DEAL
WITH RIGHT NOW.

02:14.819 --> 02:17.474
THEY HAVE GRIFFIN'S
HOSPITAL BILLS TO SWEAT...

02:19.750 --> 02:22.039
THIS IS MY FAULT.
I SHOULD'VE PAID MORE ATTENTION.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.909
THERE'S NOBODY TO BLAME
HERE, BAILEY, BUT ME.

02:23.949 --> 02:27.319
JOE, JUST BE QUIET, OK?
AND LET ME HANDLE THIS.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.492
JUST LET ME THINK.

02:39.009 --> 02:41.895
♪ EVERYBODY WANTS TO LIVE ♪

02:41.961 --> 02:43.534
♪ LIKE THEY WANNA LIVE ♪

02:43.558 --> 02:47.076

02:47.146 --> 02:48.776

02:48.776 --> 02:52.693

02:57.741 --> 03:00.396
♪ CLOSER TO FREE... ♪

03:08.143 --> 03:10.048
WHERE'S BAILEY?
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE ELEPHANTS.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.160
THERE AREN'T ANY ELEPHANTS.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.028
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CIRCUS.

03:13.102 --> 03:14.410
IT'S FRENCH.

03:15.249 --> 03:16.814
HEY. I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:16.826 --> 03:18.413
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

03:18.519 --> 03:20.023
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
YOU READY TO GO, BUD?

03:20.039 --> 03:21.783
I'VE BEEN READY FOR AN HOUR.

03:21.809 --> 03:23.496
OK, GREAT.
BUT WE GOT TO GET GOING NOW

03:23.519 --> 03:25.514
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE BACK
AT THE RESTAURANT FOR DINNER.

03:25.589 --> 03:26.831
ISN'T JOE THERE?

03:26.932 --> 03:29.183
UH...NO. I GAVE HIM THE NIGHT OFF.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.210
WHY ARE WE EVEN GOING?
WE'RE ALREADY LATE.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.255
Julia: BAY, YOU WANT ME TO TAKE HIM?
YOU SEEM KINDA SWAMPED.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.009
NO, NO. I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

03:35.019 --> 03:36.219
COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

03:36.239 --> 03:38.329
WE COULD BOTH USE A LITTLE FUN RIGHT NOW,
DON'T YOU THINK?

03:38.929 --> 03:40.255
ALL RIGHT. GO GET YOUR COAT.

03:41.481 --> 03:43.483
UM, YOU GUYS...

03:43.483 --> 03:45.528
HAVE PROBABLY BEEN WAITING FOR THESE.

03:45.528 --> 03:46.877
OH.

03:46.877 --> 03:49.054
WAIT A SECOND. IS THIS...
IS THIS RESTAURANT MONEY?

03:49.099 --> 03:50.925
- UH-HUH.
- WHY ARE YOU GIVING THEM TO US?

03:50.925 --> 03:52.100
ALEX ALWAYS MAILS THEM.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.710
WHY IS IT PERSONAL?
THIS IS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.408
YEAH, I KNOW. I JUST...

03:55.408 --> 03:57.583
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TRANSFER
THE MONEY OVER, SO...

03:58.265 --> 03:59.269
HEY, BAY...

04:00.439 --> 04:01.823
ARE YOU SURE EVERYTHING'S OK?

04:02.606 --> 04:03.655
YEAH.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.896
YEAH, IT'S FINE. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:07.457 --> 04:08.550
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.732
Charlie: OK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BREAK DOWN PRODUCTION

04:15.732 --> 04:17.734
INTO 2 LINES.

04:17.734 --> 04:20.694
THE, UH...
THE FIRST ONE WILL BE THE OLD STUFF--

04:20.694 --> 04:22.783
NAILS, STAPLES, FASTER ASSEMBLY--

04:22.783 --> 04:24.959
AND THE SECOND ONE WILL BE THE NEW STUFF.

04:24.959 --> 04:28.197
DOWELS, TONGUE-IN-GROOVE CONSTRUCTION
ON EVERY JOINT,

04:28.689 --> 04:30.956
NO METAL, ONLY GLUE.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.272
WELL,
THAT'LL MEAN RETRAINING, RETOOLING...

04:33.272 --> 04:34.751
GUS WON'T GO FOR THAT, CHARLIE.

04:34.751 --> 04:35.927
YES, HE WILL.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.748
I GOT 37 P.O.s FROM NEW OUTLETS HERE.

04:39.639 --> 04:42.839
SO...
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO'S ON WHICH LINE.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.148
CAN I ASK YOU A DUMB QUESTION?

04:44.866 --> 04:45.902
SURE.

04:45.923 --> 04:47.976
SO WE'LL STILL HAVE JOBS NEXT MONTH?

04:49.109 --> 04:51.008
NEXT MONTH, NEXT YEAR, GUYS.

04:51.039 --> 04:53.204
WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE, OK?

04:53.204 --> 04:56.295
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP THE SHIFTS.

04:56.295 --> 04:59.196
[APPLAUSE]

05:00.549 --> 05:01.681
GUYS...

05:01.952 --> 05:03.345
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

05:03.345 --> 05:05.656
YOU KEPT US OFF UNEMPLOYMENT, MY MAN!

05:41.579 --> 05:43.749
WHAT, YOU TRYING TO GET AWAY THERE?

05:43.749 --> 05:44.949
NO.

05:44.979 --> 05:46.997
UH, ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE.

05:46.997 --> 05:48.349
I JUST...

05:48.349 --> 05:49.609
JUST HAVEN'T RUN INTO YOU.

05:49.844 --> 05:52.176
BUT I GOT TO RUN TO THIS THING
ACROSS TOWN--

05:52.176 --> 05:54.701
OH, NO. THAT'S COOL.
I'M GLAD YOU COULD PUT IN AN APPEARANCE.

05:58.099 --> 06:00.289
THE REASON I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LATELY

06:00.319 --> 06:02.199
IS THAT I'VE BEEN GOING TO
THESE OTHER MEETINGS,

06:02.199 --> 06:03.971
OVER ON MISSION. IT'S CLOSER TO WORK.

06:03.971 --> 06:06.147
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S...AW.

06:06.147 --> 06:08.169
LISTEN, I GOT TO TALK TO THIS GUY.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.473
HE'S MY CONTRACTOR.
HE OWES ME SOME BATHROOM TILES.

06:11.499 --> 06:13.349
SO I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
YOU LOOK REALLY GREAT.

06:13.369 --> 06:14.446
THANKS.

06:17.369 --> 06:20.248
THEY OUGHT TO CALL THAT THE 13th STEP,
HA HA!

06:20.248 --> 06:23.178
THE ONE YOU TAKE OUT THE DOOR,
HA HA!

06:23.669 --> 06:24.669
WHAT?

06:24.719 --> 06:26.105
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE HERE

06:26.149 --> 06:28.299
THAT WANTS TO STAY
LESS THAN I DO.

06:28.949 --> 06:30.214
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

06:30.799 --> 06:32.652
'CAUSE I CAUGHT
THAT SLICK MOVE,

06:32.652 --> 06:35.133
THE ONE WHERE YOU SLIP IN
AND YOU WAVE

06:35.139 --> 06:37.526
AND YOU SLIP RIGHT BACK OUT.
HA HA!

06:37.526 --> 06:39.310
I MEAN, I WOULD TRY THAT,
BUT...

06:39.829 --> 06:42.859
MY SPONSOR,
SHE'D, UM...

06:42.909 --> 06:45.677
GET ON HER BROOM
AND TRACK ME DOWN.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.059
OH, UM, I'M EVVIE.

06:48.638 --> 06:50.669
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M BAILEY.

06:51.099 --> 06:52.590
SO, BAILEY...

06:53.119 --> 06:54.571
DO YOU EVER GO
TO AN AA MEETING

06:54.579 --> 06:56.632
AND FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE JOINED A CULT?

06:58.939 --> 07:00.462
THIS ISN'T A MEETING.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.154
YEAH, WELL, IT--IT
MIGHT AS WELL BE.

07:02.159 --> 07:03.422
I MEAN...HA HA!

07:03.422 --> 07:06.072
THE GANG'S ALL HERE.
HA HA!

07:06.555 --> 07:07.659
SO...

07:08.639 --> 07:09.701
DO YOU?

07:11.559 --> 07:13.484
YOU MAY HAVE A POINT,
BUT I...

07:13.499 --> 07:14.499
REALLY, I GOT TO GO.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.772
NO, YOU CAN'T.
IF YOU LEAVE,

07:16.819 --> 07:18.393
THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN A TRANCE,

07:18.393 --> 07:20.047
AND I'M GONNA BE
CONVERTED FOR GOOD,

07:20.047 --> 07:21.649
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO EAT
THE MEATBALLS.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.617
I'M SORRY, BUT I--I
REALLY--I GOT TO GET GOING.

07:24.631 --> 07:26.656
OK? BUT I'M SURE
I'LL...YOU KNOW...

07:26.909 --> 07:28.219
RUN INTO YOU AGAIN.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.666
WHAT, AT--AT,
LIKE, A MEETING?

07:30.666 --> 07:32.059
YEAH. SURE.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.111
THANKS FOR BRINGING
ALL THIS FOOD, YOU GUYS.

07:38.149 --> 07:39.936
OH, IT LOOKS AMAZING.

07:39.936 --> 07:42.036
SO MUCH BETTER
THAN TAKEOUT.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.165
MMM.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.338
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE
ACTUALLY MADE THESE FROM SCRATCH.

07:46.389 --> 07:47.542
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THEM AGAIN?

07:47.553 --> 07:48.684
DOLMAS.

07:48.849 --> 07:50.599
THEY'RE STUFFED
GRAPE LEAVES.

07:50.599 --> 07:52.567
MMM. GOOD!

07:52.949 --> 07:54.908
AND YOU BROUGHT
SO MUCH EXTRA.

07:55.169 --> 07:57.579
WELL, WE KNOW HOW BUSY
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN, SO WE THOUGHT--

07:57.579 --> 07:59.259
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
GONE FOR 3 DAYS,

07:59.279 --> 08:01.741
AND I FEEL HORRIBLE
ABOUT DUMPING THE CHILD CARE

08:01.741 --> 08:03.999
- ON YOU THAT WHOLE TIME.
- WE'LL BE FINE.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.392
WE'LL JUST SPLIT
OUR TIME UP INTO SHIFTS.

08:06.901 --> 08:08.748
UM, SPEAKING
OF WHICH,

08:08.748 --> 08:10.314
UM, CAN YOU TAKE HER
TOMORROW?

08:10.314 --> 08:11.629
NOT TOMORROW.
REMEMBER?

08:11.629 --> 08:13.209
I'VE GOT MY GABAPENTIN SIDE
EFFECTS MEETING.

08:13.249 --> 08:14.603
I GOT TO PREP
ALL MORNING.

08:15.129 --> 08:17.549
BUT MY AFTERNOON'S GOOD IF YOU CAN TAKE
HER IN THE MORNING.

08:17.549 --> 08:19.976
NO, I CAN'T. I GOT
6 WHOLESALE BUYERS COMING IN

08:19.976 --> 08:21.064
FROM 9:00 TO 1:00.

08:21.064 --> 08:24.267
HM. MAYBE I SHOULD STAY
FOR AN EXTRA DAY.

08:24.283 --> 08:26.635
LOOK, HONEY, I CAN
MEET YOU IN TEXAS LATER, RIGHT?

08:26.635 --> 08:27.636
THAT'S FINE.

08:27.636 --> 08:29.420
DAPH, NO. FORGET IT.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.667
WE'LL BE FINE.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.375
OK. WELL...
I WILL, UH...

08:34.643 --> 08:36.009
GO IN AT 5:00

08:36.009 --> 08:39.690
AND LOG A FEW HOURS
BEFORE BREAKFAST,

08:40.209 --> 08:41.493
WHICH WILL BE...

08:42.869 --> 08:44.087
NO PROBLEM.

08:44.696 --> 08:45.749
GREAT.

08:45.749 --> 08:46.862
WE'RE COVERED.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.559
IT'S JUST THIS...
THIS FEELING I HAVE

08:52.599 --> 08:54.573
THAT I'M FALLING
BEHIND. I MEAN...

08:54.589 --> 08:56.450
EVERYONE ELSE IN MY LIFE--
CHARLIE, BAILEY--

08:56.469 --> 08:59.205
THEY HAVE CAREERS,
THEY HAVE KIDS...

08:59.229 --> 09:01.379
MY FRIEND JUSTIN'S
ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED...

09:01.379 --> 09:02.809
THIS IS JUSTIN,
THE EX?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.089
HE'S GETTING
STRAIGHT As,

09:04.129 --> 09:05.493
HE HAS
A 20-YEAR PLAN--

09:05.509 --> 09:07.849
CLARIFY FOR ME.
WH-WHAT NUMBER IS HE?

09:07.879 --> 09:08.889
I MEAN, HOW DO-
HOW DOES HE RATE?

09:08.909 --> 09:10.624
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD.

09:10.799 --> 09:11.860
UH...

09:11.889 --> 09:13.097
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

09:15.699 --> 09:17.110
SO WHERE IS JUSTIN?

09:17.599 --> 09:20.116
I MEAN, WHERE IS HE ON THE SCALE?
IS HE A...7?

09:20.169 --> 09:21.864
- IS HE A 9?
- WHAT SCALE?

09:21.864 --> 09:23.344
WELL,
THE FRIENDSHIP SCALE.

09:23.344 --> 09:25.381
YOU KNOW, 10--
THEY ARE WHO YOU'D WANT TO BE TRAPPED WITH

09:25.409 --> 09:27.388
ON A DESERT ISLAND,
DOWN TO ONE--

09:27.469 --> 09:29.388
YOU'D WATCH 'EM DROWN
WHEN THE SHIP GOES DOWN--

09:29.389 --> 09:30.729
ADAM, THAT IS
SO SCREWED UP.

09:30.739 --> 09:31.939

19:28.580 --> 19:30.524
AND, UH, WELL, THE SHIRT,
YOU KNOW, IS BECAUSE

19:30.530 --> 19:32.193
NOTHING--NOTHING ELSE
WAS CLEAN.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.380
AND THAT--OH,
THE CANDLES ARE--

19:34.400 --> 19:35.402
ADAM.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.116
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:38.650 --> 19:39.690
UH...

19:40.050 --> 19:41.116
OK.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.472
YOU, SEE--
UH, SIT.

19:45.507 --> 19:46.516
OK.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.833
YOU SEE, THE, UH...
THE THING IS--

19:50.870 --> 19:52.845
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM...DON'T.

19:52.850 --> 19:53.950
WHAT?

19:53.950 --> 19:55.295
DON'T.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.690
REALLY? ARE--
ARE YOU SURE?

19:56.710 --> 19:58.346
M-MAYBE I SHOULD.

19:58.346 --> 19:59.960
OR I--I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.091
I SHOULDN'T?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.279
UH, WHO KNOWS?

20:02.310 --> 20:04.113
I MEAN,
I--I CERTAINLY HAVE NO IDEA

20:04.120 --> 20:05.327
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE
THINKING OF SAYING,

20:05.340 --> 20:06.381
BUT, UM...

20:06.960 --> 20:09.478
ALL KINDS OF THINGS,
ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARE...

20:09.480 --> 20:10.793
BEST LEFT UNSAID.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.332
- RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.319
YEAH. YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:14.319 --> 20:15.378
RIGHT?

20:16.362 --> 20:17.365
ALL RIGHT.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.755
OK.

20:20.896 --> 20:22.733
DID I EVER--
DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THIS HOT SAUCE?

20:22.770 --> 20:23.909
THEY MAKE IT IN TIJUANA.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.947
IT'S LIKE
TONGUE-KISSING A VOLCANO.

20:27.230 --> 20:29.737
OR SOMETHING STUPID
LIKE THAT.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.142
- THAT'S REALLY HOT.
- YEAH, IT IS.

20:34.670 --> 20:35.843
SO, UH...

20:35.870 --> 20:36.969
WHO WAS THAT, UH,

20:36.990 --> 20:38.732
WHO WAS THAT WOMAN
OVER THERE BEFORE?

20:39.340 --> 20:40.374
WHAT WOMAN?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.036
YOU KNOW.
THE ONE YOU WERE TALKING WITH.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.034
SOUNDED LIKE IT
GOT A LITTLE HEATED.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.612
OH.

20:47.650 --> 20:49.028
NO, THAT WAS FINE.

20:49.050 --> 20:50.168
IT WAS NOTHING.

20:50.964 --> 20:52.073
OH.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.950
I--I THOUGHT I HEARD HER SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT AA.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.209
YEAH.

20:59.870 --> 21:03.455
YEAH. SHE CAME HERE
TO ASK IF I WOULD BE HER SPONSOR.

21:03.455 --> 21:06.176
Y-YOU--YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
RIGHT? NOW?

21:06.310 --> 21:07.585
NOW THAT YOU'RE
DRINKING?

21:08.880 --> 21:11.144
- NO.
- YEAH. YEAH.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.435
SO, YOU TOLD HER
THAT?

21:13.410 --> 21:14.569
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

21:14.610 --> 21:15.960
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
WANT YOUR FRIENDS

21:15.960 --> 21:18.247
- DOWN AT AA TO KNOW THAT.
- NO. IT'S NOT...

21:18.440 --> 21:19.680
- LIKE IT'S A BIG SECRET.
- RIGHT. NO.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.275
- YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
- RIGHT.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.737
BUT YOUR BROTHER AND SISTERS KNOW,
RIGHT?

21:25.540 --> 21:26.550
BAILEY?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.266
OK, WELL...

21:31.780 --> 21:34.520
THE REASON THAT I HAVEN'T SAID
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT

21:34.530 --> 21:36.890
IS BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING TO SAY.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.503
BECAUSE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.490
WELL,
IT MIGHT BE TO THEM.

21:40.510 --> 21:41.690
WELL, TO ME, IT ISN'T.

21:43.580 --> 21:46.080
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO SEE IT YOUR WAY?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.931
NO, I DON'T...
JOE.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.694
WHY, DO YOU?

21:49.700 --> 21:52.110
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO TELL THEM FOR ME?

21:52.150 --> 21:55.550
NO! ALL I THINK IS THAT
IT'S SOMETHING THAT--

21:55.550 --> 21:58.197
I WOULD THINK THAT YOU'D
UNDERSTAND MY POSITION.

21:58.890 --> 21:59.906
YOU KNOW?

21:59.950 --> 22:04.160
HOW...MAYBE IT'S BEST
NOT TO UPSET THEM

22:04.180 --> 22:06.720
WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY
WOULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND.

22:21.810 --> 22:22.893
HI.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.721
PRINT, COPY, OR FAX?

22:25.742 --> 22:28.167
I DON'T SEE A DISK
OR A DOCUMENT ON YOU.

22:30.056 --> 22:32.502
LOOK, I MADE
A COUPLE OF CALLS,

22:32.544 --> 22:34.597
AND I FOUND OUT THAT
YOU WORKED HERE.

22:35.210 --> 22:36.741
WELL, I HAVE TO GET
THIS TONER CHANGED.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.816
THERE'S PEOPLE WAITING
FOR THE MACHINE.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.202
I WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY...

22:45.244 --> 22:46.689
FOR HOW I ACTED BEFORE.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.604
YOU ASKED ME
A FAIR QUESTION--

22:49.604 --> 22:50.859
LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY THAT.

22:50.890 --> 22:52.999
I MEAN,
I WAS OUT OF LINE.

22:52.999 --> 22:57.247
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
YOU WEREN'T. OK?

22:57.274 --> 22:59.480
I MEAN, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT OF AA...

22:59.480 --> 23:03.456
IS TO HAVE PEOPLE AROUND
WHO UNDERSTAND.

23:05.076 --> 23:08.406
ND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
AND YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT IT,

23:08.406 --> 23:10.451
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
HOW YOU FEEL,

23:11.788 --> 23:15.361
THEN IT'S PROBABLY
AS HELPFUL TO THEM AS IT IS TO YOU.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.503
ARE YOU OK?

23:20.063 --> 23:21.149
YEAH.

23:22.298 --> 23:23.393
I'M FINE.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.138
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
A BREAK COMING UP.

23:25.564 --> 23:28.550
SO, IF YOU FEEL LIKE
COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.642
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.491
OK.

23:41.210 --> 23:42.309
HEY, WARREN.

23:42.309 --> 23:44.050
HEY, CHARLIE,
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

23:44.050 --> 23:45.916
I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC.

23:46.139 --> 23:47.890
SURE. I'M KINDA
IN A RUSH THOUGH.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.390
I GOTTA GET HOME
TO TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.405
YEAH, I GOT
A COUPLE OF KIDS MYSELF.

23:51.405 --> 23:53.821
SO, UH, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

23:54.037 --> 23:55.275
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT...

23:55.801 --> 23:58.618
HINGS AREN'T
EXACTLY WORKIN' THE WAY YOU SAID.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.188
I MEAN, WE'RE USING
THE CHEAPER WOOD,

24:01.190 --> 24:03.150
AND WE'RE JOINING
WITH METAL--

24:03.150 --> 24:04.462
YEAH.
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:04.462 --> 24:05.737
AND SOME OF THE GUYS,
I MEAN,

24:05.777 --> 24:06.944
WE'RE WORRIED.

24:07.682 --> 24:10.752
SOME BUYERS CAME BY,
AND GUS SHOWED THEM THE LINE,

24:10.770 --> 24:13.471
AND THE LOOKS
IN THEIR FACES--

24:13.471 --> 24:16.205
I MEAN, YOU COULD TELL
THESE GUYS WEREN'T--

24:17.493 --> 24:18.563
HEY, GUS.

24:22.530 --> 24:23.595
GOOD NIGHT.

24:29.169 --> 24:30.662
WELL, UH...

24:30.662 --> 24:32.228
[ENGINE STARTS]

24:32.228 --> 24:34.250
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL
HAVE TO LOWER PRICES A LITTLE BIT.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.363
COME ON, THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE.

24:36.363 --> 24:38.583
LOOK, GUS HAS BEEN DOING THIS
MOST OF HIS LIFE, WARREN.

24:38.583 --> 24:40.600
IF HE THINKS THAT HE CAN
GET CUSTOMERS THAT WAY,

24:40.600 --> 24:43.203
LET'S--
LET'S GIVE HIM A SHOT.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.970
GUS THINKS A LOT
OF THINGS, CHARLIE,

24:45.010 --> 24:46.428
LOOK WHERE THAT GOT US.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.319
WARREN...

24:49.430 --> 24:51.568
I FOUGHT WITH HIM
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.939
I MEAN,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

24:53.940 --> 24:56.456
IT'S HIS FACTORY.
HE OWNS THE PLACE.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.895
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

24:59.310 --> 25:01.450
WELL, YOU GOT US
THIS FAR, AND...

25:01.470 --> 25:04.470
LAST NIGHT I TOOK
OUT MY FAMILY TO EAT.

25:04.940 --> 25:06.717
FIRST TIME
IN 6 MONTHS,

25:06.770 --> 25:08.737
AND IT FELT GOOD,
YOU KNOW?

25:09.240 --> 25:12.004
TO NOT WORRY THAT
I MIGHT LOSE MY JOB.

25:13.068 --> 25:14.440
IT FELT GOOD.

25:18.780 --> 25:21.840
AND I'LL BE LISTENING
TO THIS GUY SHARING,

25:23.020 --> 25:27.588
AND HE'LL SAY,
"I'M 10 YEARS SOBER, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,"

25:27.588 --> 25:29.334
AND EVERYBODY
CLAPS LIKE MONKEYS.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.026
LIKE, HEY,
ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC?

25:31.026 --> 25:36.940
AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS,
"10 YEARS SOBER, AND YOU'RE STILL HERE?"

25:39.470 --> 25:42.007
GOD, I'M BORING YOU
SPEECHLESS.

25:42.010 --> 25:43.545
NO, EVVIE...

25:45.258 --> 25:47.027
THIS IS GOOD FOR ME,
TOO...

25:47.242 --> 25:48.581
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

25:50.830 --> 25:52.313
SO, TELL ME THE TRUTH.

25:54.582 --> 25:56.172
DOES IT EVER GET BETTER?

25:57.170 --> 25:58.924
OR IS THIS WHAT I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

25:58.924 --> 26:02.625
10 YEARS SOBER,
AND STILL FEELING

26:03.440 --> 26:06.118
THE WAY I DO RIGHT NOW.

26:06.366 --> 26:07.738
EVVIE, COME ON...

26:08.423 --> 26:09.812
IT'S LIFE.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.656
IT'S LIFE, I MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

26:15.634 --> 26:17.467
I WANT TO FEEL GOOD.

26:18.490 --> 26:19.715
THAT'S ALL.

26:20.786 --> 26:22.252
IS THAT SO MUCH?

26:26.820 --> 26:29.683
NO,
I DON'T THINK...SO.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.783
I HOPE NOT.

26:46.580 --> 26:47.630
HEY.

26:48.504 --> 26:50.506
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE HOME.
I LEFT YOU A BUNCH OF MESSAGES.

26:50.510 --> 26:51.700
BUT LOOK AT THIS,
HERE YOU ARE.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.055
YEAH. UM...

26:53.110 --> 26:55.371
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
ON MY WAY TO THE LIBRARY.

26:55.371 --> 26:56.420
SO...

26:56.420 --> 26:58.026
ADAM,
YOU CANCELLED BREAKFAST,

26:58.026 --> 27:00.330
YOU BLEW OFF THE DATE
WE MADE TO WORK ON YOUR APPLICATION--

27:00.330 --> 27:01.395
I WAS BUSY.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.645
WHAT CAN I SAY?

27:04.330 --> 27:06.795
OK, LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS, THEN I AM.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.560
'CAUSE I THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, ADAM,

27:08.580 --> 27:10.735
WITH THE FLOWERS
AND THE MUSIC AND THE SHIRT--

27:10.735 --> 27:13.273
- JUST WAIT, WAIT, WAIT--
- NO, LET ME SAY THIS. PLEASE.

27:14.415 --> 27:18.183
YOU ARE SO GREAT, ADAM.
YOU'RE FUN...

27:18.200 --> 27:21.426
AND YOU'RE FUNNY,
AND YOU'RE SMART, AND YOU'RE...

27:21.470 --> 27:22.812
REALLY--YOU'RE...

27:23.630 --> 27:25.777
YOU'RE EVERYTHING
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

27:26.183 --> 27:27.763
YOU'RE
A REALLY GREAT FRIEND.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.384
AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
IS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS

27:30.410 --> 27:33.239
WHY I CAN'T LET IT
TURN INTO MORE.

27:33.405 --> 27:35.281
I HAVE THESE REALLY BAD
BOYFRIEND HABITS.

27:35.281 --> 27:37.880
I JUMP FROM ONE TO
THE NEXT REALLY QUICKLY

27:37.880 --> 27:39.740
AND ALL KINDS OF
OTHER THINGS,

27:39.740 --> 27:42.820
BUT THE MAIN ONE BEING
THAT IF I LET IT TURN INTO MORE

27:42.820 --> 27:45.240
AND IT GOES BADLY,
LIKE IT DID LAST NIGHT,

27:45.250 --> 27:49.477
THEN, UM,
I'M AFRAID TO LOSE YOU.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.255
SO, I JUST--
RIGHT NOW I--

27:55.039 --> 27:56.420
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
THAT RISK.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.178
YOU ARE FUNNY.

28:03.178 --> 28:06.290
I'M...
EXPLAIN THAT, PLEASE.

28:06.290 --> 28:07.539
YOU KNOW,
FIRST OF ALL,

28:07.560 --> 28:09.467
POINTS FOR GETTING IT
PARTWAY RIGHT.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.317
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT IT, YES.

28:11.317 --> 28:12.710
SEE, AND THAT'S FINE,
ADAM, THAT'S--

28:12.740 --> 28:14.059
I SAID WAS.

28:14.366 --> 28:15.670
YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT ME OUT DANCING,

28:15.670 --> 28:17.513
THERE WAS, YOU KNOW,
THE CONTACT THING.

28:17.540 --> 28:19.194
YEAH, SURE, I ADMIT IT.

28:19.194 --> 28:22.055
YOU KNOW, IT MADE ME WONDER
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.420
WHICH LASTED THROUGH DINNER
THAT NEXT NIGHT

28:24.453 --> 28:26.996
WHEN I REALIZED NO WAY.
NO.

28:27.620 --> 28:29.124
IT'S MUCH BETTER PLATONIC.

28:31.230 --> 28:33.898
OK, SO, THEN, WHY DID YOU START
AVOIDING ME LIKE THAT?

28:33.898 --> 28:35.034
JULIA.

28:36.190 --> 28:37.244
DID IT NEVER OCCUR TO YOU

28:37.280 --> 28:40.542
THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
BESIDES YOU TO THINK ABOUT?

28:40.940 --> 28:44.198
YOU KNOW, SOME GOOD REASON
NOT TO CALL YOU BACK RIGHT AWAY?

28:45.170 --> 28:47.864
I MEAN,
HERE'S A CONCEPT FOR YOU.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.220
NOT EVERY BOY
WANTS TO MARRY YOU.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.266
YOU WERE...BUSY?

28:58.350 --> 29:00.446
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE APPLICATION THING YOU MENTIONED.

29:00.446 --> 29:01.621
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LOT OF WORK...

29:01.621 --> 29:03.189
WHICH I WANTED TO DO
BY MYSELF.

29:04.760 --> 29:05.886
OH.

29:05.886 --> 29:08.470
OH, MAN, DID I--
I AM SO--

29:08.470 --> 29:10.630
NO, IT'S OK.
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

29:10.630 --> 29:12.375
MOST GUYS,
YOU'D PROBABLY BE RIGHT.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.084
JUST NOT ME.

29:20.556 --> 29:21.640
HEY, GUS.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.918
- HEY.
- LISTEN, UH...

29:26.490 --> 29:28.226
I'M SORRY,
BUT WE GOTTA TALK.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.040
YEAH, I GUESS WE DO.

29:31.450 --> 29:33.106
I MADE SOME PHONE CALLS...

29:33.261 --> 29:35.437
AND PRACTICALLY
HALF OUR BUYERS

29:35.437 --> 29:38.046
SAID THEY'D PULL THEIR ORDERS
IF WE SWITCHED TO PINE.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.972
- NOW, THAT'S--
- CHARLIE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

29:40.010 --> 29:41.922
NOW, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT RISKING THE EXTRA MONEY--

29:41.922 --> 29:42.923
GIVE IT A REST, WILL YA?

29:42.923 --> 29:43.940
NO, I WON'T!

29:43.960 --> 29:46.344
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
FIGHT YOU ON THIS, I WILL.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.582
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A TOUGH TIME WHEN I'M IN TAHITI.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.643
WHEN YOU'RE--

29:53.120 --> 29:54.141
WHAT?

30:00.506 --> 30:03.147
I WAS SITTIN' HERE
ABOUT 4 OR 5 HOURS AGO,

30:03.160 --> 30:05.235
AND A COUPLE OF GUYS
CAME IN OFF THE FLOOR,

30:05.250 --> 30:08.194
YOU KNOW, WITH A PROBLEM...
AND I GAVE 'EM MY ANSWER.

30:08.693 --> 30:09.760
AND THEY STOOD THERE.

30:10.496 --> 30:12.102
HEH. I SAID,
"WHAT'S WRONG?"

30:12.800 --> 30:13.893
THEY GOT ALL
EMBARRASSED,

30:13.916 --> 30:16.937
AND THEN ONE OF THEM SAID,
"WHERE'S CHARLIE?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.297
WHEN'S HE COMING IN?"

30:21.229 --> 30:22.431
LOOK, GUS--

30:23.268 --> 30:26.680
SO I WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR,
AND I TOOK A GOOD LOOK.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.518
HEH.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.121
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
FURNITURE, CHARLIE,

30:31.138 --> 30:32.461
THE STUFF
YOU'RE BUILDING.

30:33.136 --> 30:34.453
THE CRAZY THING IS...

30:34.453 --> 30:38.080
PEOPLE WILL THINK I'M THE GENIUS THAT
MADE IT ALL HAPPEN,

30:39.522 --> 30:42.601
WHEN THE BEST THING
I CAN DO IS JUST GET OUT OF THE WAY.

30:44.453 --> 30:46.910
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU'RE--YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT LEAVING?

30:47.310 --> 30:51.035
DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT
GONNA DISAPPEAR ON YA.

30:51.035 --> 30:53.719
THERE'LL STILL BE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS.
I'LL BE AROUND.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.164
GUS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T.

30:56.224 --> 30:57.845
THIS BUSINESS,
IT NEEDS YOU.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.082
IT'S YOURS, SON.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.534
I WANT YOU TO RUN IT.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.420
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M ASKING FOR, GUS.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.659
I'M NOT EVEN
READY FOR THAT.

31:06.659 --> 31:08.120
OH, SURE YOU ARE.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.881
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING THIS, CHARLIE?

31:11.575 --> 31:14.442
YOU THINK I'D GIVE IT
TO ANYBODY I DIDN'T ABSOLUTELY TRUST?

31:14.479 --> 31:16.504
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED, GUS.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.109
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

31:18.419 --> 31:19.618
I DON'T KNOW.

31:21.019 --> 31:22.766
MAYBE IT IS.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.963
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, BAILEY?

31:39.990 --> 31:41.505
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND YOU.

31:41.971 --> 31:43.280
YOU WEREN'T HOME
LAST NIGHT.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.830
YEAH, I--
I GOT IN LATE. WHY?

31:47.455 --> 31:49.571
YEAH, WE LEFT YOU A TON
OF MESSAGES AT WORK.

31:49.571 --> 31:51.051
YOU DIDN'T CALL US BACK.

31:51.517 --> 31:53.622
BAILEY, JOE TOLD US
WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.664
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL US ABOUT THIS, BAILEY?

31:55.664 --> 31:57.179
IT'S NOBODY'S
BUSINESS.

31:57.474 --> 31:59.213
- Claudia: NOBODY'S BUSINESS?
- NO.

31:59.216 --> 32:02.236
THAT PLACE--BAILEY,
THAT'S OUR RESTAURANT, TOO.

32:03.850 --> 32:05.040
WAIT.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.352
THE RESTAURANT?

32:07.520 --> 32:09.156
I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO HANDLE IT, BAILEY,

32:09.156 --> 32:14.241
BUT JUST FOR MY OWN SAKE,
TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST,

32:14.260 --> 32:15.327
I TOLD THEM.

32:18.020 --> 32:21.024
NOW, YOU SEE WHY I'D WANT
TO DO THAT, DON'T YOU?

32:22.180 --> 32:23.241
GOOD FOR YOU.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.088
Julia:
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:28.088 --> 32:30.090
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
WHEN CHARLIE FINDS OUT--

32:30.090 --> 32:31.268
NO, WE DON'T.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.490
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

32:32.490 --> 32:33.810
IT'S ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF.

32:33.810 --> 32:34.834
SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
WRITE A CHECK

32:34.834 --> 32:36.833
FROM YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
AND FORGET ABOUT IT?

32:36.867 --> 32:38.280
JOE IS PAYING ME BACK.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.495
SO, UNTIL HE DOES,
WE'RE DONE.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.002
THIS ISN'T ALL THAT'S WRONG WITH
THE RESTAURANT, BAILEY.

32:43.006 --> 32:44.911
BUSINESS IS DOWN,
AND WE NEED THAT MONEY.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.803
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
THE SAME THING FOR MONTHS NOW.

32:46.803 --> 32:48.925
JUST SIT TIGHT. BE PATIENT.
IT'LL ALL COME BACK.

32:48.970 --> 32:50.415
AND IT HASN'T COME BACK,
HAS IT, BAILEY?

32:50.415 --> 32:51.764
OK, GUYS, RELAX.

32:51.764 --> 32:53.679
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT
GONNA RELAX.

32:53.679 --> 32:55.028
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU,

32:55.028 --> 32:56.050
AND WHAT IS WITH THIS

32:56.060 --> 32:57.900
- WEIRD DENIAL THING?
- LOOK, JULIA,

32:57.920 --> 33:00.036
I'M NOT IN ANY DENIAL,
OK?

33:00.090 --> 33:01.382
YEAH, RIGHT.

33:01.935 --> 33:03.692
WELL, TOMORROW YOU WON'T BE.
WE CALLED ALEX.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.935
WE'RE GONNA MEET WITH HIM.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.224
YOU WHAT?

33:06.810 --> 33:08.256
YOU CALLED
MY ACCOUNTANT?

33:08.290 --> 33:10.288
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN
WITH THE BOOKS, BAILEY.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.657
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

33:11.867 --> 33:12.904
YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:13.560 --> 33:16.530
NONE OF YOU--
NONE OF YOU HAS ANY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.090
OK, WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY.
WHAT I DO WITH MY LIFE--

33:19.090 --> 33:20.358
BAILEY, WE'RE NOT SAYING
THIS IS YOUR FAULT,

33:20.358 --> 33:21.600
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL US THE TRUTH--

33:21.600 --> 33:22.734
NO, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

33:22.770 --> 33:24.536
I'M TELLING YOU
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.810
- BAILEY--
- I SAID I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.231
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY. I MEAN...

33:38.380 --> 33:39.967
IT SOUNDS LIKE
CHAMPAGNE IS IN ORDER,

33:40.020 --> 33:43.779
BUT WHAT--WHAT IS WITH
THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE?

33:44.570 --> 33:46.188
WELL, I HAVEN'T
SAID YES YET.

33:47.472 --> 33:49.544
OK, WHY NOT?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.902
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:52.610 --> 33:57.100
THIS JOB--
ALL THE DECISIONS--

33:57.118 --> 33:59.677
EVERYTHING--
IT'S ALL GONNA BE ME.

34:00.286 --> 34:02.863
EXACTLY. SO NO ONE
CAN STOP YOU FROM DOING

34:02.863 --> 34:03.950
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

34:03.950 --> 34:05.979
INCLUDING ALL THE TIMES
THAT I'M WRONG.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.086
I MEAN, THIS COMPANY COULD STILL
EASILY GO UNDER, KIRSTEN.

34:09.086 --> 34:10.087
EASILY.

34:10.087 --> 34:11.262
CHARLIE, COME ON.

34:11.705 --> 34:14.892
I MEAN, THE FREEDOM TO
DRAW WHATEVER YOU WANT

34:14.919 --> 34:16.137
AND THEN
ACTUALLY MAKE IT?

34:16.137 --> 34:18.479
NO, NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S MY DREAM JOB.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.597
IT'S JUST...

34:20.629 --> 34:21.663
WHAT?

34:24.604 --> 34:25.928
TIMES 3.

34:26.546 --> 34:28.399
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW HARD I WORK NOW.

34:28.845 --> 34:30.066
PUTTING THIS STUFF
INTO PRODUCTION

34:30.073 --> 34:32.816
IS GONNA TAKE
EVERY MINUTE.

34:32.850 --> 34:34.167
I MEAN, FORGET
ABOUT SEEING ME.

34:34.220 --> 34:36.765
FORGET ABOUT ME BEING ABLE
TO HELP OUT WITH DIANA AT ALL.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.609
SO...SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

34:42.655 --> 34:45.192
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
DON'T DO IT?

34:45.216 --> 34:48.604
NO. NO.
IT'S JUST...

34:51.995 --> 34:53.957
THIS IS IT.
IF I DO THIS,

34:53.957 --> 34:58.193
IT CAN'T BE, "WHICH ONE OF US
IS GONNA MAKE A CONCESSION?"

34:58.726 --> 34:59.991
IT HAS TO BE YOU.

35:00.930 --> 35:03.830
I CAN'T TAKE THIS JOB
AND THEN ONLY DO HALF THE WORK.

35:04.312 --> 35:07.381
SO, IF THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO DO,

35:07.390 --> 35:10.209
TO MAKE ROOM IN YOUR WORK
TO BE WITH DIANA, THEN...

35:11.780 --> 35:14.505
YOU TELL ME,
AND I'LL SAY NO.

35:16.389 --> 35:18.411
I THINK, UM...

35:20.630 --> 35:22.464
IF THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT...

35:26.183 --> 35:29.439
THEN--THEN
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.258
THANK YOU.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.421
ADAM. ADAM,
ADAM, ADAM, HELLO!

35:50.450 --> 35:51.460

35:52.640 --> 35:54.234
YES. YES, I AM.
'CAUSE I BRING--

35:54.240 --> 35:55.960
I BRING BRILLIANT NEWS.

35:55.970 --> 35:58.683
OK, LISTEN, YOU DID NOT
HEAR THIS FROM ME,

35:58.697 --> 36:00.424
AND I DID NOT HEAR
THIS FROM BECCA,

36:00.470 --> 36:04.206
MY FRIEND IN ADMISSIONS,
BUT, UH, YOU PASSED YOUR G.E.D.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.508
OK? OK? AND THE DEAN
LOVED YOUR ESSAY.

36:06.508 --> 36:09.166
SO, ADAM, IT LOOKS--
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

36:13.260 --> 36:15.463
DID YOU HEAR ME?
IS THAT NOT GREAT?

36:15.524 --> 36:18.377
YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

36:18.495 --> 36:20.877
NO, NO, ADAM,
BE HAPPIER. I INSIST.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.858
YOU WORKED SO HARD
ON YOUR APPLICATION,

36:22.889 --> 36:24.974
AND NOW--NOW
YOU ARE GONNA GET IN.

36:25.014 --> 36:26.038
YOU'RE GONNA GET IN.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.999
STOP. I SAID STOP!

36:28.880 --> 36:30.983
- WHAT?
- WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT, HUH?

36:31.017 --> 36:32.880
- WHAT WAS WHAT?
- WHAT? THE--THE--

36:32.920 --> 36:35.292
THE HUGGING-ME THING
WITH THE KISSING.

36:35.728 --> 36:37.599
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.229
I CAN'T?
WHY NOT?

36:40.733 --> 36:41.766
BECAUSE.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.348
BECAUSE...WHAT?

36:46.290 --> 36:48.686
LOOK, UH, I LIED...

36:49.079 --> 36:52.309
WHEN--WHEN I SAID THOSE
FEELINGS WEREN'T THERE.

36:52.350 --> 36:55.593
WHEN THE TRUTH IS,
I WANT TO KISS YOU SO MUCH--

36:55.660 --> 36:56.788
JULIA...

36:57.000 --> 36:58.380
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

36:58.380 --> 37:00.467
BUT WHY--
WHY CAN'T WE JUST TRY?

37:00.550 --> 37:03.799
HUH? YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF WE DO AND IT IS SO GREAT--

37:03.799 --> 37:05.584
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF
IT'S NOT A MISTAKE?

37:06.708 --> 37:08.050
ADAM, I REALLY DON'T KNOW YET.
I DON'T KNOW--

37:08.060 --> 37:09.859
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY, BUT--

37:19.206 --> 37:20.292
OH.

37:22.601 --> 37:24.826
WELL, THAT SURE
SUCKED, HUH?

37:24.860 --> 37:26.371
NO, NO, NO, IT DIDN'T.

37:26.390 --> 37:28.389
- IT WAS, UM, IT WAS--
- NO, NO, NO, IT WAS CRAP.

37:28.389 --> 37:29.496
DON'T LIE.

37:30.450 --> 37:33.133
YOU WEREN'T INTO IT,
AND I LOST MY NERVE.

37:33.133 --> 37:36.093
THE WHOLE THING
SORT OF COLLAPSED ONTO ITSELF.

37:36.093 --> 37:37.703
IT WAS, UH, IT WAS
PRETTY HORRIBLE.

37:37.703 --> 37:39.792
- ADAM--
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GLAD.

37:39.792 --> 37:41.060
I'M GLAD WE DID IT.
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

37:41.080 --> 37:42.761
WE TRIED, AND NOW
WE KNOW IT'S A BAD IDEA.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.860
SO THE KISS THING
IS BEHIND US,

37:46.900 --> 37:49.541
AND WE NEVER EVER
HAVE TO GO THERE AGAIN.

37:49.541 --> 37:51.271
- ADAM--
- NEVER AGAIN.

37:54.067 --> 37:55.098
OK.

37:55.587 --> 37:56.722
NEVER AGAIN.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.985
OK.

38:01.341 --> 38:02.571
GOOD THEN.

38:03.590 --> 38:04.594
YEAH.

38:11.663 --> 38:12.999
ARE YOU EXPECTING HIM
SOON?

38:12.999 --> 38:15.697
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A 5:00 AND...

38:15.697 --> 38:17.525
WE CAN RESCHEDULE
IF YOU WANT.

38:17.910 --> 38:19.660
MAYBE HE JUST GOT
THE APPOINTMENT WRONG.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.827
YOU WROTE HIM A NOTE,
DIDN'T YOU?

38:20.850 --> 38:22.400
[SIGHS]
OH, MAN.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.053
BAILEY--
I MEAN, HIS TIMING COULDN'T BE WORSE.

38:24.053 --> 38:25.526
I CANNOT AFFORD TO
BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.926
I'VE GOT MEETINGS
ON MEETINGS.

38:26.926 --> 38:29.556
OK, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'LL START WITHOUT HIM.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.020
OK.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.023
FOR YOU. HERE'S
ANOTHER COPY FOR YOU.

38:53.996 --> 38:54.998

SO, YOU WANT TO
COME INTO THE MEETING?

39:04.177 --> 39:07.390

39:14.887 --> 39:16.542
YOU SHOULD GO,
AND THEN...

39:17.415 --> 39:18.602
WE'LL DO
SOMETHING AFTER.
