WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:10.181
THE LAST TIME
MARK HAD A PROBLEM,

00:10.181 --> 00:12.043
HE WAS AWAY FROM HOME
TESTIFYING IN ONE OF HIS CASES.

00:12.043 --> 00:14.145
WHY CAN'T YOU
REMEMBER EVERYTHING?

00:14.145 --> 00:16.047
BECAUSE I WAS LOADED, OKAY?

00:16.047 --> 00:18.489
BEFORE HE TURNED AROUND,
THE FLASH-FORWARD ENDED.

00:18.489 --> 00:20.721
SO I DON'T THINK HE SAW ME.
HIS SON'S YOUR PATIENT.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.423
MY SON'S CONDITION MAKES HIM
A LITTLE HARD TO READ.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.196
DYLAN'S AUTISTIC.
YOU'RE PANICKED OVER
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

00:25.196 --> 00:28.199
BUT WE'VE GOTTA USE THESE
FLASH-FORWARDS TO OUR ADVANTAGE.
(cell phone rings)

00:28.199 --> 00:31.162
HEY, MARK.
WE GOT OUR FUNDING.
MOSAIC'S STILL ALIVE.

00:31.162 --> 00:32.733
(tires screech)
MARK?

00:38.369 --> 00:41.412
(train whistle blows)

00:49.680 --> 00:52.223
I KNOW WHAT CAUSED
THE FLASH-FORWARDS.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.059
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.791
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.833
THE WORLD'S GREATEST MYSTERY'S
BEEN SOLVED BY A BOOZER

01:02.833 --> 01:04.795
ON A TRAIN BOUND
FOR LOS ANGELES.

01:04.795 --> 01:07.268
CAN YOU CONNECT
TO THE INTERNET WITH THAT?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.570
REAL QUICK,
DO AN IMAGE SEARCH

01:09.570 --> 01:12.203
FOR
"QUANTUM PHYSICIST GENIUS."

01:12.203 --> 01:15.176
GO ON. I'LL WAIT.

01:17.248 --> 01:19.350
WHICH POPPED UP FIRST--

01:19.350 --> 01:21.182
ME WINNING
THE ROBERT WILSON AWARD

01:21.182 --> 01:23.714
OR THE JAUNTY ONE
OF ME HOLDING LAB GOGGLES

01:23.714 --> 01:26.217
OVER MY GENITALS?

01:26.217 --> 01:29.620
HOLD UP. YOU REALLY--

01:29.620 --> 01:32.092
I'M OBVIOUSLY WASTING
MY TIME.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.126
I'M SORRY. I'VE JUST HEARD THAT
LINE A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE.

01:35.126 --> 01:37.698
YOU GENUINELY WANT TO KNOW?
OF COURSE.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.301
THE FLASH-FORWARDS
WERE CAUSED BY YOU.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.674
(train whistle blows)
IT'S SIMPLE
QUANTUM MECHANICS, REALLY.

01:43.674 --> 01:46.137
WHENEVER A HEAVENLY BODY

01:46.137 --> 01:48.239
CARRIES SUCH AN INTENSE FORCE
OF ATTRACTION,

01:48.239 --> 01:51.111
THE UNIVERSE JUST GOES...
BANANAS.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.715
SOUNDS TECHNICAL.
HELPS IF YOU HAVE
A PhD OR TWO.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.218
IF MY CALCULATIONS
ARE CORRECT,

01:57.218 --> 02:00.120
YOUR DARK ENERGY COULD BRING
ABOUT ANOTHER CATASTROPHE

02:00.120 --> 02:02.122
AT ANY MOMENT.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.595
LUCKILY, I'VE PINPOINTED
THE ONE LOCATION ON EARTH

02:04.595 --> 02:08.459
THAT HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE ENOUGH
FORCE TO COUNTERACT YOU.

02:08.459 --> 02:11.632
LET ME GUESS--
YOUR SLEEPER CAR.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.435
GRAB YOUR PURSE.
WE'VE NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.169
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
THAT WOULD WORK.

02:18.169 --> 02:20.441
MAYBE FOR A 21-YEAR-OLD
SORORITY GIRL.

02:20.441 --> 02:24.615
BUT, UM, I'VE LEARNED
NEVER TO GO ANYWHERE

02:24.615 --> 02:27.418
UNLESS I'M GONNA GET
THE REAL THING.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.420
THE ACTUAL CAUSE?

02:29.420 --> 02:30.621
MM.

02:30.621 --> 02:32.623
I HAVE A THEORY,
BUT THE, UH...

02:32.623 --> 02:35.155
THE SCIENCE IS
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.428
I'M A COMPLICATED GIRL.

02:37.428 --> 02:40.531
THE MOST BASIC CONCEPT
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

02:40.531 --> 02:41.832
IS QUANTUM SUPERPOSITIONS.

02:41.832 --> 02:45.165
ARE YOU AWARE OF
THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.198
WELL, THERE WAS THAT
ONE TIME IN COLLEGE...

02:47.198 --> 02:50.170
WHAT ABOUT SCHRODINGER'S CAT?
NO, I'M NOT THAT KINKY.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.902
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

02:51.902 --> 02:54.575
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

02:57.948 --> 03:04.585
OKAY. NOW IMAGINE
YOU HAVE A CAT...

03:04.585 --> 03:07.518
B.L.'s A LITER IN THE FIELD
AND ONLY ONE P.I.V.

03:07.518 --> 03:10.391
WE NEED ACCESS HERE!

03:10.391 --> 03:12.192
(indistinct shouting)

03:12.192 --> 03:14.895
A TEENY, TINY CAT...

03:14.895 --> 03:17.698
(Olivia) WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
(man) WE'VE GOT A GUNSHOT WOUND
TO THE ABDOMEN.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.831
WE NEED TO SET UP A PERIPHERAL.
WE NEED ACCESS HERE!
JANIS?

03:20.831 --> 03:23.203
THAT FITS IN THE PALM
OF YOUR HAND.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.676
(monitor beeping)

03:25.676 --> 03:28.839
YOU ALSO HAVE
A POISONOUS SARDINE.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.211
ONCE WE CLOSE YOUR PALM,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.883
THERE ARE
TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS.

03:32.883 --> 03:34.985
(beeping rapidly)

03:34.985 --> 03:38.349
(Olivia) BRING THE CODE CART.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

03:38.349 --> 03:39.820
(defibrillator whines)
CLEAR.

03:41.452 --> 03:44.725
EITHER THE CAT EATS THE SARDINE
AND DIES, OR THE CAT DOESN'T EAT

03:44.725 --> 03:46.757
THE SARDINE AND LIVES.
(emitting continuous tone)

03:46.757 --> 03:48.459
NO RESPONSE.
GOING AGAIN.

03:48.459 --> 03:50.931
(thump)
QUANTUM PHYSICS SAYS

03:50.931 --> 03:53.964
UNTIL WE OPEN YOUR HAND
TO DISCOVER THE CAT'S FATE,

03:53.964 --> 03:57.338
BOTH EVENTUALITIES OCCUR
AT THE SAME TIME.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.769
(Olivia) CLEAR.
(thump)

03:58.769 --> 04:00.941
STILL NO RESPONSE.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.473
DO C.P.R.

04:02.473 --> 04:05.916
FOR US, THE CAT IS
BOTH LIVING AND DECEASED.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.819
(woman) BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?
THAT'S THE MIRACLE
OF QUANTUM MECHANICS--

04:08.819 --> 04:11.251
THE OBSERVER GETS TO DECIDE.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.424
THE KITTY'S ALREADY
MADE UP ITS MIND.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.925
ALIVE OR DEAD?

04:14.925 --> 04:18.889
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.996
â™ªâ™ª

04:25.996 --> 04:28.268
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
(woman)
HEMOGLOBIN'S HOLDING AT 12.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.603
(Bryce) HALLELUJAH.

04:32.603 --> 04:35.275
(Olivia) OKAY.
FASCIA'S CLOSED.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.309
"O" SILK ON A DRIVER
TO DR. VARLEY.

04:38.309 --> 04:39.880
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.983
A FEW HOURS AGO, I DIDN'T
THINK WE'D GET THIS FAR.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.856
CLOSE THE SKIN.
LET ME KNOW WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.862
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:51.862 --> 04:53.824
This is Mark.
(sighs)

04:53.824 --> 04:56.627
Leave it here.
I'll get back to you.
(beep)

04:56.627 --> 04:59.700
(sighs) HI. IT'S ME.
WHERE ARE YOU?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.972
I HAVE BEEN
CALLING AND CALLING.

05:01.972 --> 05:06.006
I TRIED DEMETRI AND STAN.
I JUST CAN'T GET THROUGH.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.910
I TRIED THE OFFICE, AND THEY'RE
JUST STONEWALLING ME.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.912
AFTER THIS THING WITH JANIS,

05:11.912 --> 05:14.915
I DON'T KNOW, I'M WORRIED.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.787
CAN YOU JUST CALL ME?

05:16.787 --> 05:19.820
PLEASE?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
I LOVE YOU.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.826
I LOVE YOU.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.430
(beep)

05:32.963 --> 05:34.965
OHH.

05:37.968 --> 05:40.371
AGAIN, DADDY, AGAIN.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.573
YOU'RE NOT BORED
WITH THIS ONE?

05:42.573 --> 05:44.575
NO! CARDS. MAKE THE CARDS.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.678
OKAY. I'LL TURN AROUND,
AND YOU CHOOSE.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.553
SO, DYLAN,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.955
YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.888
WE'RE GONNA GO TO PALO ALTO.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.430
WHICH ONE?

05:59.430 --> 06:01.732
WHICH ONE?

06:01.732 --> 06:03.994
DID YOU PICK A CARD?
UH-HUH.

06:03.994 --> 06:07.037
OKAY, NOW LOOK AT IT
AND REMEMBER.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.571
OKAY?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.873
UH-HUH.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.875
OKAY.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.148
SO NOW
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

06:18.148 --> 06:20.581
I WAS THINKING
THAT THE BEST IDEA

06:20.581 --> 06:23.053
IS YOU COME AND LIVE
IN MY HOUSE WITH ME.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.415
NO.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.617
DYLAN.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.960
CARDS.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.122
WE ALL LIVED THERE
BEFORE YOUR MOTHER AND I...

06:32.122 --> 06:36.427
I MEAN, YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR OWN ROOM. IT'LL BE GREAT.

06:36.427 --> 06:38.699
CARDS!

06:38.699 --> 06:41.001
PLEASE. I NEED YOU
TO GO ALONG WITH THIS.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.576
UH...

06:45.576 --> 06:48.909
UM, OKAY. UH...

06:48.909 --> 06:51.982
IS THIS YOUR CARD?

06:51.982 --> 06:54.615
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.947
HEY, BUDDY. ALMOST TIME
FOR TRICK-OR-TREATING.

06:56.947 --> 07:00.050
THAT'S TODAY?
YEAH, IT'S THE 31st.
IT'S HALLOWEEN.

07:00.050 --> 07:03.193
THE KIDS GO FROM ROOM--
NO, NO, NO, I KNOW. I JUST
FORGOT TO GET HIM A COSTUME.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.696
UM, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
OKAY?

07:05.696 --> 07:08.028
EXCUSE ME.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.060
PLAYING CARDS, BUD?

07:10.060 --> 07:12.933
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

07:15.165 --> 07:17.908
HOW'S JANIS?
TWO UNIFORMED COPS
OUTSIDE HER ROOM.

07:17.908 --> 07:21.171
ONLY HER DOCTOR AND FBI BADGES
ARE ALLOWED INSIDE.
GOOD WORK.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.614
NO ONE WILL BE ABLE
TO GET TO HER.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.616
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?

07:25.616 --> 07:27.818
WHOEVER IT WAS THAT CAME
AFTER YOU LAST NIGHT,

07:27.818 --> 07:30.481
WHAT'S TO STOP THEM
FROM TRYING AGAIN?

07:30.481 --> 07:31.822
NOTHING.

07:38.929 --> 07:41.061
(chair scrapes)

07:43.594 --> 07:44.995
(whispering) HEY.

07:44.995 --> 07:47.167
HEY!

07:47.167 --> 07:49.600
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.742
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S NOTHING.

07:51.742 --> 07:53.744
BUT YOU HAVE BLOOD
ON YOUR SHIRT.

07:53.744 --> 07:56.046
(lowered voice)
WELL, NOW LISTEN. LISTEN.

07:56.046 --> 07:58.649
THERE'S A ROOM FULL OF
FBI AGENTS THAT NEED A DOCTOR

07:58.649 --> 08:01.181
TO TELL 'EM IF JANIS
IS GONNA MAKE IT.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.153
OH. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:03.153 --> 08:05.656
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.888
OKAY.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.820
HI.
HEY.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.822
WE HAD HER IN SURGERY
FOR FIVE HOURS.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.825
THE BULLET DID SOME DAMAGE,
BUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE

08:14.825 --> 08:16.967
ANY LASTING EFFECTS.
AND?

08:16.967 --> 08:18.899
AND SHE'S IN RECOVERY.
SHE'S SEDATED.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.931
WE'LL KNOW MORE
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

08:20.931 --> 08:24.004
OLIVIA, YOU SAVED HER LIFE.
THANK YOU.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.677
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, IT'S BEEN
A LONG NIGHT FOR ALL OF US.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.039
IT'LL BE A WHILE BEFORE
WE KNOW ANYTHING MORE.

08:29.039 --> 08:31.642
THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T NEED US
CLOGGING THINGS UP.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.944
SO I GOT YOUR NUMBERS.
GET SOME REST.

08:33.944 --> 08:36.917
I'LL CALL YOU IF I HEAR
ANYTHING. YOU, TOO, DEMETRI.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.989
I'M SORRY, BOSS, NO.

08:38.989 --> 08:41.121
I'M EITHER STAYING HERE
TO SEE HER THROUGH,

08:41.121 --> 08:43.994
OR I'M GOING OUT AND FINDING
THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS TO US.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.126
THERE ARE ALREADY
TWO DOZEN AGENTS WORKING THIS

08:46.126 --> 08:49.129
WHO DIDN'T HAVE A GRENADE
LAUNCHED AT 'EM LAST NIGHT.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.131
NOW I'M SERIOUS.
GET OUTTA HERE.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.834
AND IF IT HELPS,
CONSIDER IT AN ORDER.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.706
COME ON.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.240
YOU TIRED?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.813
WELL,
WEDECK TOLD US TO GO HOME.

09:02.813 --> 09:05.976
NO. HE SAID FOR US
TO GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

09:08.218 --> 09:11.181
IT'S A SURFACE WOUND.
JUST LEAVE IT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:11.181 --> 09:13.283
I WANT TO SEE WHAT
THOSE D.C. DOCTORS DID.

09:13.283 --> 09:16.657
OH, LIVY, IT'S NOTHING.
COME ON. YOU WANT TO
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

09:16.657 --> 09:19.059
YOU DON'T--
I WANT TO KNOW.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.962
(sighs)

09:21.962 --> 09:23.964
WE WERE ATTACKED.

09:23.964 --> 09:27.297
UM, PRETTY BAD FIREFIGHT.

09:27.297 --> 09:30.140
WEDECK AND DEMETRI
KILLED ONE OF THEM.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.743
THE OTHERS ESCAPED.

09:32.743 --> 09:35.976
IT'S GOTTA BE CONNECTED TO
THE GUYS WHO CAME AFTER JANIS.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.578
SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.580
BECAUSE YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING THE BLACKOUT?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.914
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO KILL YOU BECAUSE OF THAT?

09:43.914 --> 09:46.356
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:46.356 --> 09:49.860
STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE IT ALL OUT.

09:49.860 --> 09:53.293
OH, SEE? I KNEW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.126
NO.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.128
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

09:58.128 --> 10:00.200
IT'S...

10:00.200 --> 10:02.202
WHEN THEY
BROUGHT JANIS IN,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.905
I COULDN'T GET AHOLD
OF YOU.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.907
MY IMAGINATION
JUST RAN WILD--

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
I MEAN, NOT KNOWING
WHERE YOU WERE,

10:08.909 --> 10:12.142
NOT KNOWING
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

10:12.142 --> 10:15.816
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.818
BUT I'M HERE,

10:17.818 --> 10:20.090
AND I'M OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

10:20.090 --> 10:23.093
I'M ALL RIGHT.

10:23.093 --> 10:25.956
WE HAVE JUST BEEN SO...
(sniffles)

10:25.956 --> 10:28.258
OBSESSED WITH WHAT WE SAW,

10:28.258 --> 10:30.230
AND WITH THE FUTURE,

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
WITH WHAT MIGHT
OR MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.105
AND IT'S--
IT'S A DISTRACTION.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.868
IT'S JUST PULLING US OUT
OF TODAY, AND TODAY, RIGHT NOW

10:37.868 --> 10:39.940
THIS MOMENT
IS ALL WE HAVE, BABE.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.312
IT'S ALL WE HAVE.

10:42.312 --> 10:44.975
I DON'T WANT TO MISS IT.

10:47.978 --> 10:49.950
ME NEITHER.

10:59.189 --> 11:00.991
YO.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.993
HEY, DEWEY.

11:02.993 --> 11:04.434
HOW IS SHE?

11:04.434 --> 11:07.738
A LOT BETTER THAN THESE GUYS.
ATTAGIRL, JANIS.

11:07.738 --> 11:09.740
DO YOU MIND?

11:12.372 --> 11:15.045
GOT NO I.D...

11:15.045 --> 11:16.847
NO CELL PHONE, NO KEYS.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.979
NO FINGERPRINTS,
NO DENTAL RECORDS.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.681
IT'S JUST LIKE OUR GUY
IN THE PARKING GARAGE IN D.C.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.383
WE GOT NOTHING.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.985
GOT NOTHING.

11:24.985 --> 11:29.990
THERE'S NO QUESTION NOW
WE'RE UP AGAINST REAL PROS.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.223
WHAT ABOUT,
UM, MEDICAL HISTORY, DEWEY?

11:33.223 --> 11:36.126
SO FAR JUST ONE REMOVED
APPENDIX HERE,

11:36.126 --> 11:38.098
ONE ACHILLES SURGERY THERE.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.771
I'M CHECKING
FOR RADIAL KERATOTOMY SCARS

11:40.771 --> 11:42.232
AS WE SPEAK.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.977
HEY, DEMETRI.

11:46.977 --> 11:48.208
DEMETRI.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.111
YEAH? WHAT?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.442
YOU DOING OKAY IN HERE?

11:52.442 --> 11:54.815
YEAH. WHY?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.487
YOU PUT YOURSELF ON MOSAIC.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.991
YOU THINK THERE'S
ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE

12:00.991 --> 12:03.493
WHO DOESN'T KNOW BY NOW?

12:03.493 --> 12:06.857
BUT THE POINT IS, YOU JUST
GOT SHOT AT 12 HOURS AGO.

12:06.857 --> 12:11.031
NOW YOU'RE STANDING IN A MORGUE
ACTING KIND OF WEIRD.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.204
(chuckles)

12:14.204 --> 12:16.336
LISTEN, AL, YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING KIND OF WEIRD

12:16.336 --> 12:17.938
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.270
SO, UM, YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS,

12:20.270 --> 12:23.213
OR YOU WANT TO
GET BACK TO WORK?
WORK SOUNDS GOOD.

12:23.213 --> 12:26.216
THIS GUY'S RIGHT EYE IS
COVERED WITH CORNEAL SCARRING.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.980
NO BIG SURPRISE THERE.

12:29.980 --> 12:33.854
WHAT ASSASSIN WORTH HIS SALT
DOESN'T GET LASIK?

12:33.854 --> 12:37.027
SHOULD PRACTICALLY BE
A UNION REQUIREMENT.

12:37.027 --> 12:39.489
WAIT.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.832
YOU SEE THAT?

12:41.832 --> 12:44.294
LOOKS LIKE A HAND STAMP
FROM A BAR.

12:44.294 --> 12:45.966
NO, IT'S A BLUE HAND.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.198
IT'S A CLUE
FROM MARK'S BOARD.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.100
(whoosh)
SOMETHING ABOUT BALTIMORE--

12:50.100 --> 12:52.342
A HAND--A BLUE HAND.
(whoosh)

12:54.104 --> 12:57.107
THIS SON OF A BITCH IS
GONNA BE USEFUL AFTER ALL.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.190
THAT COSTUME IS SUPER FLY.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.123
IT WAS THE LAST THING
THEY HAD LEFT IN HIS SIZE.
NO, I LIKE IT.
REALLY, IT'S COOL.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.525
ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO LIKE THIS VERY MUCH.

13:15.525 --> 13:17.527
YEAH, IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITH HIM.

13:17.527 --> 13:20.170
I THINK HE'S MAD AT ME
ABOUT THE MOVE.

13:20.170 --> 13:24.374
OH, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS

13:24.374 --> 13:27.537
DR. BENFORD MIGHT COME BY SO WE
COULD, UH, SAY OUR GOOD-BYES.

13:27.537 --> 13:30.210
YEAH. YEAH, SURE,
I'LL LET HER KNOW.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.382
GREAT, THANKS.

13:40.991 --> 13:44.054
HEY.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.526
I'M GLAD SHE'S OKAY.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.229
YEAH. IT'S PRETTY
SCARY STUFF FOR ALL OF US.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.101
YEAH.

13:51.101 --> 13:54.364
LISTEN,
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK,

13:54.364 --> 13:56.366
AND MAYBE I SAID SOME THINGS

13:56.366 --> 13:58.568
THAT WERE OUT OF LINE.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.110
UM...

14:03.143 --> 14:05.145
LET'S TAKE A DEEP BREATH

14:05.145 --> 14:08.248
AND GET BACK ON TRACK HERE,
HMM?

14:11.551 --> 14:14.925
OHH.
THIS ONLY TAKES QUARTERS.

14:14.925 --> 14:15.986
MM-HMM.

14:15.986 --> 14:18.088
I GOT IT.

14:18.088 --> 14:20.630
THERE.
THANK YOU.

14:20.630 --> 14:22.492
WE'RE EVEN NOW.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.199
THE GUYS WHO CAME AFTER YOU,

14:29.199 --> 14:31.501
THE GUYS WHO SHOT JANIS--
ALL ASIAN.

14:31.501 --> 14:33.503
WHY DON'T I HEAD OVER
TO HUANG'S OFFICE,

14:33.503 --> 14:36.046
SEE IF BLUE HAND HAS
SOME SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE

14:36.046 --> 14:38.448
IN CANTONESE OR MANDARIN?
MANDARIN? COME ON, MAN.

14:38.448 --> 14:41.211
ACCORDING TO THE CIA, CHINA
MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

14:41.211 --> 14:44.184
IF THEY DID, TRYING TO BLOW UP
A TEAM OF FEDERAL AGENTS

14:44.184 --> 14:46.186
SEEMS A LITTLE SHOWY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.318
WELL, IN THEIR MINDS,

14:48.318 --> 14:50.991
I MEAN, IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE
AS NEUTRALIZING A THREAT.
WELL, THEN WHY COME AFTER US?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.163
THE CIA AGENT WHO TESTIFIED
AT THE HEARINGS YESTERDAY

14:53.163 --> 14:55.926
IS FINE, BUT MARK TALKS
ABOUT D. GIBBONS, SUSPECT ZERO,

14:55.926 --> 14:58.028
THE CROWS FOR THE FIRST TIME
OUTSIDE OF THIS OFFICE,

14:58.028 --> 15:00.100
AND THEN EIGHT HOURS LATER,
IT'S...

15:00.100 --> 15:03.203
CHINA IS A DEAD END.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.675
I DON'T WANT BLUE HAND
TO BECOME ONE, TOO.

15:05.675 --> 15:10.110
(Olivia) ALL RIGHT,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
I AM IN A HOSPITAL?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.143
VERY GOOD.
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

15:16.046 --> 15:18.048
NO.

15:18.048 --> 15:20.520
(monitor beeping)

15:20.520 --> 15:23.393
BUT FOR SOME WEIRD REASON,

15:23.393 --> 15:25.996
I GET THE FEELING
THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS

15:25.996 --> 15:27.998
A LITTLE BIT
OF A NEAT FREAK.

15:27.998 --> 15:29.259
(chuckles)

15:29.259 --> 15:32.032
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW HE DOESN'T LIKE

15:32.032 --> 15:35.005
HIS BLACK PENS
TO TOUCH HIS BLUE PENS.

15:35.005 --> 15:38.168
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?
UH-HUH.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.411
SHE'S BACK.

15:43.373 --> 15:45.675
YOU'RE AN AMAZING DOCTOR.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.577
AND AN OVERWORKED ONE.

15:47.577 --> 15:49.579
I WISH I COULD BE
WITH YOU GUYS TONIGHT.

15:49.579 --> 15:51.281
OH, WE'LL TAKE PICTURES.

15:51.281 --> 15:53.723
CAN YOU MAKE SURE SHE
DOESN'T EAT TOO MUCH CANDY?

15:53.723 --> 15:56.056
SURE.
JUST, LIKE, A COUPLE
OF PIECES OR SOMETHING.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
COUPLE?
20.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.561
(whispers)
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.963
BYE.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.167
WHEN MARK HAD YOU PIN
THE BLUE HAND CARD TO THE BOARD,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.499
HE KNEW IT WAS SOMEHOW RELATED
TO THE WORD "BALTIMORE."

16:09.499 --> 16:11.501
YES, THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING, SPARKY.

16:11.501 --> 16:14.004
OKAY, BALTIMORE STREET
IS 5 MILES AWAY.

16:14.004 --> 16:17.707
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.
BUT YOU WERE ATTACKED
LAST NIGHT IN D.C.

16:17.707 --> 16:20.150
SO BALTIMORE, MARYLAND,
IS THE BETTER BET.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.282
YEAH, BUT THE GUY WHO HAD
THE BLUE HAND STAMP ON HIM

16:22.282 --> 16:24.284
WAS IN L.A., ALL RIGHT?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.556
BALTIMORE STREET
IS IN SILVER LAKE.

16:26.556 --> 16:31.461
IF I'M WRONG--IF I'M WRONG,
WE'VE WASTED AN HOUR. WHAT?
SO YOU BELIEVE
IN THESE VISIONS NOW?

16:31.461 --> 16:34.064
IT'S--IT'S COMPLICATED.

16:34.064 --> 16:35.695
NO, I GET IT.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.198
I MEAN, IF I HADN'T HAD
A FLASH-FORWARD,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.700
I'D BE DOING EVERYTHING
I COULD TO PROVE

16:40.700 --> 16:43.002
THOSE VISIONS WEREN'T TRUE.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.575
LISTEN, IF WE HAD ANYTHING
TO GO ON AT ALL HERE,

16:45.575 --> 16:48.007
ANY REAL-LIFE LEAD
WHATSOEVER,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.680
BELIEVE ME, I'D BE THE FIRST GUY
TALKING TO BALLISTICS

16:50.680 --> 16:54.013
OR FORENSICS OR WHATEVER,
ALL RIGHT? BUT WE DON'T.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
I JUST WANT TO FIND THE ANIMALS
THAT ARE TRYING TO KILL US,

16:57.016 --> 17:00.120
AND BALTIMORE STREET IS
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.552
ALL RIGHT? SO COME ON.

17:02.552 --> 17:05.795
I'LL BUY YOU A PRESSED SANDWICH
FROM THE CUBAN PLACE.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.557
SOLD.

17:07.557 --> 17:10.260
ONE OUT.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.031
(children laughing)

17:12.031 --> 17:14.134
(woman) OH, YEAH!

17:14.134 --> 17:18.308
(laughs evilly)
SUPER SHARK HAS MONKEY-SEE
AND MONKEY-DO IN HIS HELMET!

17:18.308 --> 17:21.141
HE'S TRYING TO EAT THEM!
DADDY, THAT PULLS.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.343
HAPPY HALLOWEEN. OH, A PIRATE.
JUST BE STILL.
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.045
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T HAVE A COSTUME.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.448
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A COSTUME.
I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE BUSY LATELY.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.381
I CAN FINISH UP WITH HER IF YOU
WANT TO GET IN YOUR COSTUME.

17:31.381 --> 17:33.583
THANKS, NICOLE,
BUT I'M NOT WEARING A COSTUME.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.825
YOU COULD GO
AS TIM-TIM'S DAD, JIM TIM.

17:35.825 --> 17:38.828
(sighs) WHAT DOES
TIM-TIM'S DAD LOOK LIKE?

17:38.828 --> 17:42.362
DON'T SAY A WORD, OBI-WAN.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.234
(chuckles)

17:44.234 --> 17:47.437
(children speaking indistinctly)

17:47.437 --> 17:49.299
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
WHOA.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.075
WAS THAT A KANGAROO?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.148
THAT IS THE BEST COSTUME
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.357
HEY, I GOT SOME MILK FROM
THE NURSES' STATION TO...

18:07.357 --> 18:09.189
DYLAN?

18:09.189 --> 18:11.691
I'M--I'M SORRY.
I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY SON.

18:11.691 --> 18:15.295
WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE?
UH, HE'S ABOUT THIS BIG,
UH, WEARING, UM...

18:15.295 --> 18:17.627
WELL--WELL, A PIMP'S OUTFIT.

18:17.627 --> 18:20.830
I MEAN, I ONLY TURNED
MY HEAD FOR A SECOND.
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, BUT THERE
ARE TONS OF KIDS AROUND.

18:20.830 --> 18:27.437
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK
THE NURSES' STATION.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

18:27.437 --> 18:30.440
I'M SURE AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

18:30.440 --> 18:32.142
THE OFFICE IS CHAOTIC.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.314
I'M RIGHT WHERE
I NEED TO BE.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.217
I JUST FEEL
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE

18:37.217 --> 18:39.349
IN THIS GOWN AND...

18:39.349 --> 18:42.121
YEAH, I ASSOCIATE
THOSE CRAPPY GOWNS

18:42.121 --> 18:45.195
WITH MY WIFE
DELIVERING OUR SON.

18:45.195 --> 18:47.797
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN
A THING LIKE THAT...

18:47.797 --> 18:49.829
WAS IT AWFUL?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.262
JUST THE OPPOSITE.
IT'S... PRIMAL.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.764
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THERE
AT THE BEGINNING

18:54.764 --> 18:57.667
OF SOMETHING... MIRACULOUS...

18:57.667 --> 18:59.909
A NEW LIFE.

18:59.909 --> 19:04.544
(whoosh)

19:04.544 --> 19:06.216
YOU'LL SEE.

19:06.216 --> 19:09.619
(monitor beeping rapidly)

19:09.619 --> 19:13.152
WHAT'S THAT?
THAT LITTLE MONITOR
UP THERE.

19:15.225 --> 19:17.887
EXCUSE ME. WHAT--
JANIS, I'M SORRY. WE HAVE
TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE O.R.

19:17.887 --> 19:20.260
BRING THE TYPE SPECIFIC.
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.862
YOUR BLOOD COUNT'S DROPPING.
GET HER ON A PORTABLE.
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:22.862 --> 19:24.864
DON'T KNOW.

19:24.864 --> 19:29.199
(train whistle blows)

19:29.199 --> 19:31.201
(laughing)

19:31.201 --> 19:32.672
TIMES SQUARE.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.873
APRIL 29th.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
THE ESTIMATES
ON THE MOSAIC WEB SITE

19:35.875 --> 19:38.448
HAVE US AT HALF A MILLION
PEOPLE ALREADY.

19:38.448 --> 19:41.211
THE BALL IS GONNA DROP
AND EVERYTHING.

19:41.211 --> 19:43.853
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
GOING TO THEIR FUTURE.

19:43.853 --> 19:46.956
MM-HMM.
IT'S A GLORIFIED
NEW YEAR'S PARTY.

19:46.956 --> 19:49.589
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
BETTER TO DO?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.861
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

19:51.861 --> 19:53.663
WHO IS SHE?

19:53.663 --> 19:56.866
OH, COME ON.
I TOLD YOU MINE.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.871
HE...

20:01.871 --> 20:04.734
HAD A NECK LIKE AN OX...

20:04.734 --> 20:07.537
SMELLED LIKE
A MEAT LOCKER...

20:07.537 --> 20:10.440
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU GUYS DOING?

20:10.440 --> 20:13.783
I HAD MY HANDS
AROUND HIS NECK.

20:13.783 --> 20:17.216
(grunting)
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WAS

20:17.216 --> 20:20.690
OR WHO THE MAN WAS...
(grunting)

20:20.690 --> 20:25.455
BUT I FELT MY THUMBS
PRESS DOWN ON HIS TRACHEA...

20:25.455 --> 20:27.997
(snaps)
UNTIL SOMETHING SNAPPED.

20:31.401 --> 20:35.305
AND THEN I LET GO...

20:35.305 --> 20:38.237
LOOKED DOWN
AT HIS LIFELESS BODY,

20:38.237 --> 20:41.671
QUITE SATISFIED.

20:45.515 --> 20:47.847
AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU ASKED?

20:55.985 --> 20:59.028
I FOUND THIS
ON THE SOUTH EXIT CAMERA.
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS?

20:59.028 --> 21:00.860
17 MINUTES.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.393
WHERE COULD HE BE HEADED
THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

21:03.393 --> 21:05.695
I HAVE NO IDEA.

21:12.041 --> 21:14.574
(brakes hiss)

21:17.046 --> 21:18.348
YOU GETTING ON?

21:18.348 --> 21:20.380
MM-HMM.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.912
THEN GET ON.
COME ON. WE GOTTA GO.

21:22.912 --> 21:26.055
HEY, KID, YOU GOTTA
PAY THE FARE! HEY!

21:26.055 --> 21:29.288
HEY, KID.
(snaps fingers)

21:29.288 --> 21:32.061
YOU GOTTA PAY THE FARE.
NOW DO YOU HAVE IT OR NOT?

21:32.061 --> 21:34.924
YO.

21:34.924 --> 21:36.926
ARE YOU LOST?

21:36.926 --> 21:38.668
TO OUR FRIENDS

21:38.668 --> 21:41.501
AT 25696 SAWYER COURT,

21:41.501 --> 21:45.074
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,
90024.

21:45.074 --> 21:47.337
WHAT IS HE,
BRAIN DAMAGED OR SOMETHING?

21:47.337 --> 21:51.941
IS HE ONE OF THOSE--
I'M GONNA PUT YOU DOWN LIKE
A SICK DOG IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP.

21:51.941 --> 21:55.585
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.
THAT'S YOUR HOUSE?

21:55.585 --> 21:57.887
YOU KNOW THAT ADDRESS?

21:57.887 --> 22:00.950
YEAH, AND HE'S GONNA NEED
A TRANSFER.

22:00.950 --> 22:03.793
THAT'S $1.55.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.027
(sighs)

22:08.027 --> 22:10.400
DON'T WORRY, KID.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.001
DO YOU KNOW
ANY MAGIC TRICKS?

22:12.001 --> 22:15.465
NO, MIJO. I DON'T DO MAGIC.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.339
YOU SAID AN HOUR.
IT'S BEEN OVER THREE.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.811
(beep)

22:21.811 --> 22:23.913
SHE'S BACK IN SURGERY.

22:23.913 --> 22:26.546
SHE'LL PULL THROUGH.
WHY?

22:26.546 --> 22:29.048
SHE HAD A FLASH-FORWARD,
SO SHE HAS A FUTURE?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.781
(woman) 450 OUT,
AND SHE'S TACHY IN THE 130s.

22:31.781 --> 22:33.723
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

22:33.723 --> 22:34.984
WE ONLY HAVE
ONE REAL OPTION HERE.

22:34.984 --> 22:36.526
5-0 VICRYL.

22:36.526 --> 22:38.888
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DR. BENFORD--

22:38.888 --> 22:41.561
WE'RE GONNA DO A B-LYNCH.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.533
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE NIGHT BEFORE

22:43.533 --> 22:45.895
SHE AND I GRADUATED
FROM QUANTICO?

22:45.895 --> 22:48.768
NO.
WE'RE AT SOME DORM ROOM
GETTING HAMMERED.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.501
I GET US A BEER. WE FINISH.
SHE GETS US A COUPLE MORE,

22:51.501 --> 22:55.004
THEN A COUPLE OF SHOTS,
AND, UH, I'M STARTING TO WORRY

22:55.004 --> 22:56.976
THAT NERDY LITTLE GIRL'S
GONNA HAVE TO HAVE

22:56.976 --> 23:00.079
HER STOMACH PUMPED, RIGHT?
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT A B-LYNCH

23:00.079 --> 23:01.881
WILL CONTAIN THE BLEEDING.
A B-LYNCH IS A FAR LESS
INVASIVE PROCEDURE.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.914
GIVES HER A FIGHTING CHANCE
OF STILL HAVING

23:04.914 --> 23:06.916
A NORMAL, HEALTHY UTERUS.
BARELY.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.158
(Demetri) NEXT THING I KNOW,
IT'S 4:00 A.M.

23:09.158 --> 23:12.692
I WAKE UP ON LINOLEUM,
GOT A FOOT IN THE TOILET.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.064
I LOOK OVER.
JANIS IS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE

23:15.064 --> 23:17.997
PLAYING QUARTERS
AGAINST HERSELF.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.999
HER INSIDES ARE STRONGER
THAN ANY BULLET.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.102
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
BE HONEST--

23:23.102 --> 23:25.174
WOULD YOU BE MAKING
THE SAME DECISION

23:25.174 --> 23:27.907
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THIS PATIENT PERSONALLY?

23:27.907 --> 23:31.140
5-0 VICRYL.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.942
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--

23:32.942 --> 23:35.945
YOU BLACKED OUT
AFTER FIVE DRINKS,

23:35.945 --> 23:37.947
AND THEY LET YOU
KEEP YOUR BADGE?

23:37.947 --> 23:40.890
THAT'S...
(chuckles) YOU KNOW WHY?

23:40.890 --> 23:44.053
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.907
IT'S LIKE THE HAND
ON MARK'S BOARD.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.011
(children) TRICK OR TREAT!
(laughing)

24:02.011 --> 24:05.675
HEY, GUYS.
DIG IN, COWBOY, PRINCESS.

24:05.675 --> 24:09.018
A VERY COOL COSTUME.

24:09.018 --> 24:10.850
HI.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.952
AND?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.223
UM?

24:19.228 --> 24:21.060
HEY!

24:21.060 --> 24:24.233
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

24:24.233 --> 24:27.196
YOU REALLY SHOULD
SEE A DENTIST.

24:27.196 --> 24:31.641
MY PARENTS
COULDN'T AFFORD BRACES.

24:31.641 --> 24:32.902
(chuckles)

24:32.902 --> 24:36.075
THANKS FOR COMING OUT
TONIGHT.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.007
I LOVE HALLOWEEN.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.149
AND, UH,
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

24:40.149 --> 24:42.912
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT
DOING NORMAL STUFF.

24:42.912 --> 24:46.115
YEAH, I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
FOR ALL OF US TO START...

24:46.115 --> 24:47.917
LET'S GET GOING!

24:47.917 --> 24:51.020
OKAY.
PAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE...

25:13.883 --> 25:17.116
(Mark) WATCH HER.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.048
HEY!

25:21.120 --> 25:22.992
FBI! STOP!

25:22.992 --> 25:26.055
(children
shouting indistinctly)
FBI! STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

25:32.201 --> 25:35.234
SAME HAND, ONLY THIS ONE'S
MISSING SOME FINGERS.

25:35.234 --> 25:39.008
AND, UM, THE OTHER WAY.

25:39.008 --> 25:42.972
THAT WAS THE ORIENTATION
ON OUR ASSAILANT.

25:42.972 --> 25:47.877
AM I CRAZY, OR DOES IT LOOK
LIKE IT'S POINTING THAT WAY?

25:47.877 --> 25:50.920
(man) â™ª SCARY MONSTERS â™ª

25:50.920 --> 25:53.853
â™ª AND SUPER CREEPS â™ª

25:53.853 --> 25:57.156
â™ª KEEP ME RUNNING â™ª

25:57.156 --> 26:01.090
â™ª RUNNING SCARED â™ª

26:01.090 --> 26:04.594
â™ª SCARY MONSTERS â™ª

26:04.594 --> 26:06.936
â™ª AND SUPER CREEPS â™ª

26:08.598 --> 26:10.870
â™ª KEEP ME RUNNING â™ª

26:10.870 --> 26:14.103
â™ª RUNNING SCARED â™ª

26:14.103 --> 26:18.047
â™ªâ™ª

26:51.681 --> 26:53.012
(grunts)

26:53.012 --> 26:54.984
WASN'T MY--

26:54.984 --> 26:58.888
IT WASN'T MY IDEA!

26:58.888 --> 27:02.091
I DIDN'T THROW ANY EGGS!
I JUST THREW SOME TOILET PAPER!

27:02.091 --> 27:05.955
(breathing heavily)
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS MASK?

27:05.955 --> 27:07.356
99 CENTS STORE, MAN.

27:07.356 --> 27:09.959
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL MY DAD,
ARE YOU?

27:09.959 --> 27:12.802
(cell phone rings)

27:12.802 --> 27:14.934
(ring)

27:14.934 --> 27:16.936
(ring, beep)

27:16.936 --> 27:20.269
YEAH, NICOLE?

27:20.269 --> 27:24.113
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

27:24.113 --> 27:26.045
MAKES SENSE.
YOU RUN AN UNDERGROUND CLUB,

27:26.045 --> 27:29.218
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE FIND IT.

27:29.218 --> 27:31.250
IF THE HAND'S POSITIONING
IS THE DIRECTION,

27:31.250 --> 27:32.752
WHY THE MISSING FINGERS?

27:32.752 --> 27:35.084
THE LAST HAND
HAD THREE FINGERS, RIGHT?

27:35.084 --> 27:38.858
WE JUST DROVE THREE BLOCKS.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.432
THAT'S IT.

27:43.432 --> 27:45.294
NICE.

27:45.294 --> 27:48.067
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I TRIED OLIVIA FIRST.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.940
SHE'S IN SURGERY.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.943
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, AND HE
HAD ON THIS HOSPITAL BRACELET

27:53.943 --> 27:56.846
THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET OFF
AND CALL HIS DAD.

27:56.846 --> 27:59.949
HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER.
I'M MARK. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27:59.949 --> 28:02.281
MY NAME IS DYLAN.
MY FAVORITE BOOK IS

28:02.281 --> 28:05.985
"HARRY POTTER,"
PRISONERS OF AZKABAN.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.187
MY DAD DOES MAGIC.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.860
OKAY, UM, DYLAN,

28:10.860 --> 28:12.892
DOES YOUR DAD
KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

28:12.892 --> 28:15.324
THIS IS MY HOUSE, TOO.

28:15.324 --> 28:18.898
NO, DYLAN, THIS IS MY HOUSE,
AND I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT

28:18.898 --> 28:20.970
HOW YOU GOT HERE
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

28:22.832 --> 28:24.734
(whoosh)

28:27.837 --> 28:30.439
GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.

28:33.182 --> 28:36.886
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THIS ADDRESS?

28:36.886 --> 28:38.047
(whoosh)

28:38.047 --> 28:42.892
"TO OUR FRIENDS
AT 25696 SAWYER COURT,

28:42.892 --> 28:44.723
"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.725
90024."

28:46.725 --> 28:49.498
HEY, DYLAN!
HI, CHARLIE.

28:49.498 --> 28:51.360
NUTS TO YOU, SQUIRRLIO!

28:51.360 --> 28:55.464
TOOT, TOOT!
TOOT, TOOT!

28:55.464 --> 28:58.768
WHAT WAS THAT?

28:58.768 --> 29:02.842
IT'S FROM THE CARTOON.
CHARLIE, DO YOU--
DO YOU KNOW DYLAN FROM SCHOOL?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.213
NO, HE'S JUST MY FRIEND.

29:04.213 --> 29:06.115
(knock on door)

29:06.115 --> 29:08.447
WHAT?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.452
HELLO.
I THINK MY SON IS HERE.

29:13.452 --> 29:17.126
(Nicole) YEAH, HE'S RIGHT HERE.
COME ON IN.

29:17.126 --> 29:20.059
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
DON'T WORRY, HE SEEMS FINE.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.061
HE JUST SLIPPED OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.393
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'D JUST WANDER OFF.

29:24.393 --> 29:27.296
UM, THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIM...
SURE.

29:27.296 --> 29:29.969
MR...
BENFORD. MARK BENFORD.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.971
RIGHT.
AND I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.

29:31.971 --> 29:35.144
UH... L-LLOYD SIMCOE.

29:40.109 --> 29:43.953
UH, UH,
THIS IS MY SON DYLAN.

29:43.953 --> 29:46.155
SIMCOE?

29:46.155 --> 29:47.887
WAIT.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.088
BENFORD?

29:49.088 --> 29:52.061
ARE YOU SOMEHOW
RELATED TO OLIVIA--

29:52.061 --> 29:54.123
UM, UM, DR. BENFORD?

29:54.123 --> 29:56.966
I'M HER HUSBAND.

29:56.966 --> 29:59.298
OF--OF COURSE. THAT--
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE--

29:59.298 --> 30:03.302
UH, YOUR NAME BEING BENFORD,
HER NAME BEING BENFORD.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.304
UH...

30:05.304 --> 30:07.476
(singsong voice)
TRICK OR TREAT!

30:12.241 --> 30:14.083
OH.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.129
(whoosh)

30:30.129 --> 30:33.102
HEY, HONEY.

30:33.102 --> 30:35.104
(whoosh)

30:37.266 --> 30:41.010
(chuckles)

30:41.010 --> 30:42.611
YOU'RE HER.

30:42.611 --> 30:44.243
NOT YET.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.277
UM...

30:48.277 --> 30:50.249
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE...

30:50.249 --> 30:52.952
WHY DON'T WE DOUBLE CHECK
YOUR CANDY IN THE KITCHEN?
(Nicole) GOOD IDEA.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.025
NICOLE, YOU WANT TO COME?

30:57.556 --> 31:00.129
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:00.129 --> 31:02.031
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW.

31:02.031 --> 31:04.863
DYLAN CAME HERE.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.366
WHY?
THIS IS MY HOUSE, TOO.

31:07.366 --> 31:11.540
(whoosh)
IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO, DYLAN.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.042
(whoosh)

31:13.042 --> 31:15.204
HE KEEPS SAYING THAT.

31:15.204 --> 31:18.447
DYLAN IS AUTISTIC.
THE REPETITIVE SPEECH--

31:18.447 --> 31:20.579
I DON'T NEED A DIAGNOSIS.

31:22.651 --> 31:25.985
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.556
WHAT?

31:27.556 --> 31:30.159
WHY I MADE HER--
WHY I MADE YOU SO--

31:30.159 --> 31:31.390
UNCOMFORTABLE?
YES.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.492
UM, OKAY, CLEARLY, UM,

31:33.492 --> 31:36.565
THIS IS
AN UNUSUAL SITUATION.

31:36.565 --> 31:39.628
NO KIDDING.
MARK, DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

31:39.628 --> 31:43.632
I CAN MAKE THIS COMFORTABLE
FOR EVERYBODY.

31:43.632 --> 31:46.175
YOU LEAVE...

31:46.175 --> 31:49.038
YOU DON'T COME BACK.

31:57.386 --> 32:02.121
I'M VERY SORRY IF WE'VE
CAUSED YOU ANY INCONVENIENCE.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.123
THANK YOU...

32:04.123 --> 32:06.025
BOTH...

32:06.025 --> 32:08.327
FOR THE KINDNESS
YOU'VE SHOWN DYLAN.

32:20.209 --> 32:22.271
THANK YOU.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.213
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

32:24.213 --> 32:27.276
(whispers) OKAY. COME ON.
GOOD NIGHT, OLIVIA.

32:27.276 --> 32:29.278
(Lloyd) COME ON, DYLAN.
LET'S GO.

32:29.278 --> 32:31.280
GOOD NIGHT, DYLAN.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.282
(door closes)

32:35.184 --> 32:36.525
LOOKS LIKE THE PARTY'S OVER.

32:36.525 --> 32:39.358
DEFINITELY OVER.

32:57.246 --> 32:59.248
(Demetri) FBI!

33:31.180 --> 33:34.083
(whoosh)

33:39.388 --> 33:45.023
THESE CAME FROM A FRIEND
OF YOURS NAMED MAYA...

33:45.023 --> 33:47.326
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.461
YOU OKAY?

33:57.066 --> 33:59.608
WHEN I GOT SHOT...

34:01.670 --> 34:03.712
THE BULLET...

34:03.712 --> 34:07.176
BOUNCED AROUND
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

34:07.176 --> 34:11.450
THE ONLY THING
THEY SAID THEY COULD DO

34:11.450 --> 34:14.483
WITHOUT TAKING
THE WHOLE THING OUT...

34:17.086 --> 34:20.058
OLIVIA DID THIS THING
CALLED A B-LYNCH.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.564
(voice breaking)
BUT WITH ALL THE SCARRING...

34:25.564 --> 34:27.336
(sniffles)

34:27.336 --> 34:31.570
THEY SAID THAT IT'S GONNA
BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE...

34:33.572 --> 34:36.175
(crying)

34:36.175 --> 34:37.846
WHY AM I CRYING?

34:37.846 --> 34:43.782
I NEVER EVEN WANTED
TO HAVE A BABY.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.115
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

34:46.115 --> 34:49.858
(crying)

34:56.865 --> 34:58.527
(blows)

35:03.472 --> 35:06.375
I CAN SEE WHY YOU LIKE HIM.
HE'S VERY CHARMING.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.637
I DON'T LIKE HIM. COME ON.

35:08.637 --> 35:11.610
CAN YOU STOP SO WE CAN
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THIS?
(dishes clattering loudly)

35:11.610 --> 35:14.143
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

35:14.143 --> 35:16.845
HE'S THE FATHER
OF ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

35:16.845 --> 35:18.847
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

35:18.847 --> 35:22.421
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
HOW HIS SON FOUND HIS WAY HERE.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.823
REALLY?
YEAH.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.857
WELL, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU SAID

35:28.857 --> 35:31.830
YOU HAD DYLAN
MOVED OFF YOUR ROTATION.
I DID.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.662
YOU DID?

35:36.305 --> 35:38.637
THEN WHY ARE YOU LISTED
AS THE ATTENDING

35:38.637 --> 35:40.869
ON HIS WRISTBAND?
OH, GOD.

35:40.869 --> 35:43.212
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

35:43.212 --> 35:47.145
MY BOSS MADETHE DECISION.
YOUR BOSS ALSO TELL YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.448
NO, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT

35:49.448 --> 35:52.451
IT WOULD MAKE A HORRENDOUS
SITUATION THAT MUCH WORSE.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.153
OH, SO YOU THOUGHT HIDING IT
WAS A BETTER PLAN.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.286
THAT'S NOT
WHAT WAS GOING ON, MARK.

35:57.286 --> 36:01.360
DON'T TURN ME
INTO SOMEONE I'M NOT.
DON'T YOU TURN THIS AROUND
AND MAKE IT ABOUT ME.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.532
THE MAN YOU MIGHT BE SLEEPING
WITH IN SIX MONTHS' TIME

36:03.532 --> 36:06.395
WAS JUST IN OUR LIVING ROOM,
AND I SURE AS HELL

36:06.395 --> 36:09.198
DIDN'T BRING HIM
INTO OUR LIVES. YOU DID!
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

36:09.198 --> 36:11.400
JUST BE HONEST.
JUST BE HONEST.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.742
HAVE--HAVE YOU BEEN
TALKING TO HIM AT WORK?

36:13.742 --> 36:17.346
OH, COME ON! COME ON, MARK.

36:17.346 --> 36:21.250
HUH? HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
ELSE I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?
MARK, DON'T INTERROGATE ME.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.182
THEN BE HONEST WITH ME!
I AM!

36:24.182 --> 36:26.755
ARE YOU BEING HONEST
WITH ME?

36:26.755 --> 36:28.457
OH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

36:28.457 --> 36:31.320
ALL THE OLD PATTERNS
ARE BACK, MARK.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.723
YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOUSE
ALL THE TIME.

36:34.723 --> 36:37.426
YOU'RE MORE
AND MORE SECRETIVE.

36:37.426 --> 36:40.569
SO I'M ASKING YOU THE SAME THING
THAT YOU ASKED ME...

36:40.569 --> 36:42.571
BE HONEST.

36:42.571 --> 36:47.436
ARE YOU HIDING
ANYTHING FROM ME?

36:47.436 --> 36:49.438
(silverware clinking)

36:51.880 --> 36:53.842
MARK?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.989
(lowered voice)
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD...

37:03.252 --> 37:05.724
I WAS DRINKING.

37:07.796 --> 37:09.528
WOW.

37:14.763 --> 37:16.835
HERE WE ARE AGAIN.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.468
OLIVIA,
THIS ISN'T LIKE BEFORE.

37:19.468 --> 37:21.239
THE LYING'S ALREADY STARTED.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.241
WHAT? NO, IT HASN'T.
THIS ISN'T THE SAME.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.774
DON'T CONDEMN ME FOR
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE YET.

37:25.774 --> 37:28.677
DID YOU EVEN HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

37:28.677 --> 37:31.019
YOU'VE BEEN PUNISHING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME

37:31.019 --> 37:33.652
FOR AN IMAGINARY
RELATIONSHIP.

37:33.652 --> 37:37.586
BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO YOU,
YOU WANT TO BE LET OFF THE HOOK.

37:37.586 --> 37:40.459
BUT OUR PAST TOGETHER,
MARK--

37:40.459 --> 37:43.692
ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
WITH YOUR DRINKING...

37:43.692 --> 37:46.595
THAT'S REAL.

37:46.595 --> 37:50.038
THAT STILL HURTS.

37:50.038 --> 37:53.872
I'M NOT GOING
THROUGH IT AGAIN.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.605
I PROMISE YOU...

37:56.605 --> 37:57.906
I'M NOT GONNA DRINK.

37:57.906 --> 37:59.978
BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE DRINKING.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.781
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.954
IT'S ABOUT TRUST.

38:05.954 --> 38:09.958
IT'S ABOUT TRUST, AND WE DON'T
TRUST EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

38:11.990 --> 38:16.325
SO EVERYTHING WE SAID
AT THE HOSPITAL TODAY

38:16.325 --> 38:20.729
ABOUT ONLY LIVING
IN THE MOMENT, WELL...

38:20.729 --> 38:22.801
ALL THAT WAS A LIE?

38:24.873 --> 38:26.735
IT'S NOT A LIE.

38:26.735 --> 38:28.937
IT'S WHAT I WANT.

38:28.937 --> 38:32.541
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S POSSIBLE ANYMORE...

38:34.443 --> 38:36.615
NOT NOW...

38:36.615 --> 38:39.648
NOT WITH US.

38:53.962 --> 38:56.565
(indistinct radio chatter)
HEY, DEMETRI?

38:56.565 --> 38:58.567
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

38:58.567 --> 39:00.969
I MEAN, ON THE SAME NIGHT
OUR GUY TRIES TO KILL JANIS,

39:00.969 --> 39:05.974
HE'S HANGING OUT HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY FOUND
THIS ON ONE OF THE BODIES.

39:05.974 --> 39:08.647
REMEMBER THE RUTHERFORD CASE?
(whoosh)

39:08.647 --> 39:09.878
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT A CASE

39:09.878 --> 39:12.080
THAT I DON'T THINK
EVEN EXISTS YET--

39:12.080 --> 39:13.982
THE RUTHERFORD CASE.
(whoosh)

39:13.982 --> 39:16.785
IT BEGINS TONIGHT.

39:16.785 --> 39:19.027
(camera shutter clicks)

39:23.532 --> 39:24.933
(whoosh)

39:27.666 --> 39:29.668
(whoosh)

39:32.701 --> 39:35.874
ALL RIGHT.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.976
IT WAS QUITE A DAY, HUH?

39:37.976 --> 39:40.879
IS IT GONNA BE HALLOWEEN
AGAIN TOMORROW?

39:40.879 --> 39:44.012
NO.

39:44.012 --> 39:46.955
JUST TODAY.

39:46.955 --> 39:49.918
GOOD, 'CAUSE IT WAS
KIND OF SCARY.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.693
YEAH.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.966
YES, IT WAS.

40:03.432 --> 40:05.974
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

40:05.974 --> 40:08.607
("Across the Universe" playing)

40:08.607 --> 40:10.939
THANKS FOR COMING
TO GET ME, DADDY.

40:10.939 --> 40:15.914

42:07.025 --> 42:09.658
OH, DAMN IT, SIMON.
YOU SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH.

42:09.658 --> 42:11.800
DID YOU EVER TAKE THE TRAIN
DOWN THE COAST, LLOYD?

42:11.800 --> 42:15.033
BREATHTAKING.

42:15.033 --> 42:18.166
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

42:18.166 --> 42:20.809
YOU DISAPPEAR
TO LOS ANGELES.

42:20.809 --> 42:22.771
YOU DON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

42:22.771 --> 42:25.043
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
WE ALL ARE.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.045
YEAH, WELL,
I MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

42:27.045 --> 42:30.278
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

42:30.278 --> 42:32.681
I DON'T CARE.
WE HAVE TO TALK.

42:32.681 --> 42:36.084
OUR EXPERIMENT KILLED

WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY?
