better luck with this place.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.023

on the hook for this place.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.930

11:02.963 --> 11:05.465

I can close the deal,

a little pressure on her.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.009

about the property,

11:16.043 --> 11:18.245
make a fake phone call,

11:18.278 --> 11:21.148
rave about the place.

11:21.181 --> 11:26.019
And then say you want
to make an offer.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.421
What, what kind of offer?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.923
$550,000.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.959

for her to hear.
