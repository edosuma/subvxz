00:08.100 --> 00:09.567
MAYBE WE COULD PUT THIS GUY
IN THE NURSERY.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.600
- OKAY, NO WAY.

00:10.633 --> 00:11.700
- THIS MEANS GOOD LUCK
IN SHANGHAI.

00:11.734 --> 00:12.767
- I DON'T CARE.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.200
IT'S GONNA GIVE
MY BABY NIGHTMARES.

NO, DON'T WORRY.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.133
I'M GONNA PUT MOST OF THIS STUFF

MADE FOR ME

00:28.734 --> 00:31.166
BY A WOMAN
AT THE XIANGYANG ROAD MARKET

00:31.200 --> 00:32.567
WHO LITERALLY
HAD NOT A TOOTH.

WHO ARE BEST WITH THEIR FINGERS.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.767

00:36.000 --> 00:38.600
SHE SECRETLY SHADOWED ME
EVERY DAY FOR TWO MONTHS

00:38.633 --> 00:40.200
JUST TO SEE HOW I WOULD USE IT,

00:40.233 --> 00:41.367
THEN SHE TAILOR FIT IT TO ME

00:41.400 --> 00:43.200
THE WAY THEY MADE
THE OLD SAMURAI SWORDS.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.367
- OH, LIKE HATTORI HANZO
IN KILL BILL.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.367
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.567
I USED TO WEAR THIS

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
FOR MY MOST IMPORTANT
BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS.

00:49.433 --> 00:51.066
IT NEVER FAILED.

NEVER FAILED.

OOH, EMMA,

01:00.367 --> 01:01.767
IT FEELS GOOD
IN YOUR LIPS.

TO SAVE THE DAY.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.600
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME.

01:17.633 --> 01:18.767
- WHY?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.500
YOU KNOW BOSEPHUS LOVES YOU
LIKE A FATHER.

01:20.533 --> 01:21.633

YOU HAVE TO DROP THE

ONLINE DATING ACCOUNT?

06:22.633 --> 06:24.000
- MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

- MAGGIE, YOU CANNOT
BE SNOOPING AROUND

06:25.133 --> 06:26.333

06:45.100 --> 06:46.567
I DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.433
IN A PIAZZA SOMEWHERE
EATING A PERFECT BAGEL?

06:53.467 --> 06:56.000
- HOLD ON.
WAIT A SECOND.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.233
THIS IS VERY, VERY FAMILIAR.

06:58.266 --> 06:59.467
- WHAT, THE PIAZZA?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
- NO.

07:00.533 --> 07:02.734
I OWN THAT SWEATER.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.100
HOLD ON.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:04.133 --> 07:06.133
- YOU REMEMBER!
THAT CARDIGAN!

07:06.166 --> 07:08.433
- THE ONE THAT YOU WORE
TO MEREDITH'S REHEARSAL DINNER?

07:08.467 --> 07:11.200
- YES, WITH THE JEAN SKIRT
THAT MADE MY THIGHS LOOK WIDE.

07:11.233 --> 07:13.200
- UGH, I TOLD YOU NOT TO WEAR
THAT JEAN SKIRT.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.100
- HERE IT IS.
HERE IT IS.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.133
ANTHROPOLOGIE CATALOG,
SPRING ISSUE.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.367
BOOM!

07:18.400 --> 07:20.367
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME PHOTO.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.133
LOOK AT THAT.
- THAT'S HER.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.633
THAT'S THE HARVEST BLOSSOM
TO-AND-FRO CARDI.

07:24.667 --> 07:27.667
- OKAY, WAIT,
SO WHOEVER THIS IS

07:27.700 --> 07:30.033
IS JUST PUTTING UP
THIS WOMAN'S PICTURES

07:30.066 --> 07:32.433
AND PRETENDING TO BE HER SO THAT
SHE CAN SCAM ZACH, RIGHT?

07:32.467 --> 07:34.033
- YEP.

07:34.066 --> 07:36.233
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE'RE
STILL CALLING HER A "HER."

07:36.266 --> 07:38.000
IT'S PROBABLY
A REALLY BIG FAT DUDE

07:38.033 --> 07:40.700
WITH A TINY
INVERTED WIENER.

07:44.767 --> 07:47.333
- HEY, ZOO.
- HEY.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.400
- CAN WE JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

07:49.433 --> 07:51.567
- OKAY, BUT I GOT TO RUN SOON.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.500
I MADE A CD OF ALL
OF CECILIA'S FAVORITE SONGS

07:53.533 --> 07:55.100
TO BE PLAYED DURING OUR DATE.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.200
I'M GONNA HEAD OVER TO ROSIE'S,
SEE IF THEY'LL PLAY IT.

07:57.233 --> 08:00.533
- ZOO,
SOMETIMES IN THIS WORLD

08:00.567 --> 08:04.467
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE
MAYBE NOT THE NICEST OF PEOPLE,

08:04.500 --> 08:07.200
YOU KNOW, AND THEY PREY
ON THE INNOCENT ONES, LIKE YOU.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.633
- AND THIS WOMAN IS A DUDE!

08:09.667 --> 08:11.367
100% DUDE.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.367
ALL RIGHT, WE BUSTED HIM TRYING
TO POSE AS A CATALOG MODEL.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.000
- NO, THAT'S CECILIA.

08:16.033 --> 08:17.333
YEAH, I REMEMBER THIS.

08:17.367 --> 08:20.066
SHE SAID THAT GYPSIES
KEPT COMING INTO THE PIAZZA

08:20.100 --> 08:21.200
WHEN THEY WERE SHOOTING THIS.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.567
- WAIT, YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS PICTURE?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.266
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
SHE'S A MODEL.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.533
THAT'S HOW SHE SUPPORTS
HER WORK

08:25.567 --> 08:27.133
WITH PROCTORS WITHOUT BOARDERS.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.700
- OH, COME ON.
- PROCTORS WITHOUT BOARDERS.

08:28.734 --> 08:30.033
WHAT'S PROCTORS?

08:30.066 --> 08:31.700
- IT'S TO PROTECT
TESTING INTEGRITY

08:31.734 --> 08:33.133
IN THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.200
- OKAY, LOOK.

08:34.233 --> 08:35.567
I'M WEARING
THE EXACT SAME SWEATER

08:35.600 --> 08:37.600
THAT SHE'S WEARING
IN THE CATALOG.

08:37.633 --> 08:38.767
- NO, THAT'S NOT
THE SAME SWEATER.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.300
- YES, IT IS.
- NO, 'CAUSE LOOK.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.667
IT'S SMOOTH AND SENSUAL
ON HER.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.533
AND YOURS HAS SHOULDER PADS
AND THEN THE WEIRD TRUNK.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.767
- NO, THESE ARE MY SHOULDERS.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.500
- OKAY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE ODD

08:49.533 --> 08:51.300
THAT ALL OF HER PROFILE PICS
ARE FROM A CATALOG?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.600
- HOLD ON.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.667
DID YOU GUYS LOG IN
TO MY LUV AT FIRST TYPE ACCOUNT?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.467
- NO!
WHAT?

08:56.500 --> 08:57.667
SHE DID.
- HEY!

08:57.700 --> 08:58.700
- AND I SAID,
"DON'T DO IT.

08:58.734 --> 09:01.166
IT'S A VIOLATION,"
IS WHAT I SAID.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.333
- LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT HORRIBLE PERSON IS UP TO,

09:03.367 --> 09:05.166
BUT WHOEVER'S SHOWING UP
TO ROSIE'S TONIGHT

09:05.200 --> 09:06.633
IS NOT GONNA BE
THIS GORGEOUS MODEL.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.166
- I SEE, YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THAT SOMEONE

09:08.200 --> 09:09.667
SO PHYSICALLY
AND EMOTIONALLY SPECTACULAR

09:09.700 --> 09:11.300
COULD FALL FOR ME.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.367
- I JUST--I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET YOUR FEELINGS HURT, ZOO.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.467
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.033
- DON'T CALL ME ZOO!
MY NAME IS ZACH!

09:17.066 --> 09:18.600
AND I AM A MAN!

09:18.633 --> 09:20.200
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO RECKON WITH ME

09:20.233 --> 09:22.033
AS SOMEONE
WHO HAS SEXUAL CHARISMA,

09:22.066 --> 09:24.066
AND IF THAT DISTURBS YOU,
I APOLOGIZE.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.400
- ZACH,
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

09:25.433 --> 09:27.500
SOMEONE DOESN'T PUT AN
INVERTED WIENER INSIDE OF YOU!

09:27.533 --> 09:29.233
- WELL,
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I WANT!

09:31.367 --> 09:34.734
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT,
BUT IF I DID WANT IT,

09:34.767 --> 09:37.433
I COULD HAVE IT
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.700
STAY OUT OF IT.

09:43.066 --> 09:44.500
- "THIS MAN IS A DUDE."

09:44.533 --> 09:46.300
- WHAT?
WHAT DID I DO?

09:46.333 --> 09:48.066
- WE REHEARSED THIS.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT--

09:48.100 --> 09:49.166
- I WAS PLAYING--
- WITH A GENTLE HAND.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
- GOOD COP, BAD COP.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.300
OF HALF SELTZER WATER,
HALF WATER.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.367
- THANK YOU.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.033
SOMETIMES THE DYNAMIC
OF THE BUBBLES

10:04.066 --> 10:05.600
IS TOO MUCH FOR MY TONGUE,

10:05.633 --> 10:08.033
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR LETTING ME PLAY MY CD.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.133
- OH, YEAH.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.133
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT KELSEY GRAMMER

10:10.166 --> 10:11.133
DID A COVER OF THE ROSE.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.767
- WAIT TILL YOU HEAR TRACK SIX.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.500
JEREMY RENNER AND GARY BUSEY
DOING A DUET

10:15.533 --> 10:17.233
OF BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE.

10:17.266 --> 10:20.333
- WOW, ALL RIGHT.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.600
DID YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

10:21.633 --> 10:24.300
- WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
AS THE BEST APPETIZER?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.233
- WELL, I LIKE ALL OF THEM.

10:26.266 --> 10:27.266
- SOLD.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.367
AND COULD YOU BRING TWO PLATES?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.600
MY DATE IS RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE,

10:31.633 --> 10:33.200
BUT SHE IS DEFINITELY COMING.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.133
[laughs]

10:35.166 --> 10:36.166
- OKAY.

10:40.367 --> 10:42.066
- EMMA, THERE IS NO WAY
THAT MY MOM

10:42.100 --> 10:43.467
IS GONNA LET ME MOVE BACK
IN HERE.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.333
- I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

10:45.367 --> 10:48.000
I AM A MASTER
OF THE ART OF NEGOTIATION,

10:48.033 --> 10:49.633
AND I'VE GOT
MY XIANGYANG ROAD BLAZER ON.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.066
MARY PAT WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HER.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.734
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S A REAL HARD-ASS.

10:52.767 --> 10:55.266
- BRUCE, BY THE END
OF THIS CONVERSATION,

10:55.300 --> 10:56.734
MARY PAT WILL NOT ONLY
TAKE YOU BACK;

10:56.767 --> 10:59.734
SHE'LL BE COOKING YOU A
POT ROAST WITH ALL THE FIXINGS,

10:59.767 --> 11:01.033
ALL RIGHT?

11:01.066 --> 11:02.200
- I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF POT ROAST.

11:02.233 --> 11:03.500
IT'S VERY WET.

11:03.533 --> 11:04.734
- WILL YOU JUST SHUT UP
AND LET ME CLOSE THIS DEAL?

11:04.767 --> 11:06.200
- ALL RIGHT.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.633
- YOU GOT A MINUTE 29.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.133
- MARY PAT,
I LOVE THAT NEW HAIRSTYLE.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.300
- THANK YOU.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.166
I JUST TELL THEM TO GIVE ME
THE DEAN MARTIN.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.633
- WELL, YOU GOT THE HEAD SHAPE
FOR IT.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.500
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
- YEAH.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.767
- BRUCE KEEPS TELLING ME
TO GROW IT OUT.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.633
- WHICH BRINGS ME
TO MY NEXT POINT:

11:25.667 --> 11:27.633
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT BRUCE HERE

11:27.667 --> 11:28.633
IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.233
- ABSOLUTELY.
- HEY.

11:30.266 --> 11:31.367
- I MEAN,
HE'S WORSE THAN GARBAGE.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.000
YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS?
YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS?

11:33.033 --> 11:35.200
HE'S RAW SEWAGE
ON A HOT DAY.

11:35.233 --> 11:38.100
- I THINK OF HIM AS A DIRTY
MELTED SNOWMAN.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.700
- ABSOLUTELY.
I'M LOVING THAT VISUAL.

11:39.734 --> 11:41.200
- I DON'T LOVE--
I DON'T LOVE IT ONE BIT.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.400
- BUT CAN I BE FRANK?

11:42.433 --> 11:45.133
CAN I SPEAK MANO A MANO
TO YOU, MARY PAT?

11:45.166 --> 11:46.400
- I GUESS SO.

11:46.433 --> 11:49.266
- WELL, THIS HUMAN GARBAGE HERE,

11:49.300 --> 11:51.400
HE CAME OUT OF SOMEWHERE,
RIGHT?

11:51.433 --> 11:53.767
YOU KNOW WHERE HE CAME OUT OF?

11:54.000 --> 11:54.767
YOU.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.233
IT'S YOUR GARBAGE.

11:56.266 --> 11:58.300
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT,

11:58.333 --> 12:00.367
AND YOU GOT TO GET IT
OFF THE STREET.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.533
I DON'T MEAN TO GO ALL GIULIANI
ON YOU,

12:02.567 --> 12:04.600
BUT YOU GOT TO GET THIS GARBAGE
OFF THE STREET!

12:04.633 --> 12:05.600
- WELL, I DON'T WANT IT.

12:05.633 --> 12:06.667
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T,

12:06.700 --> 12:07.700
BUT YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT
OUT THERE

12:07.734 --> 12:09.133
TO STINK UP
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.667
WHAT WOULD THE NEIGHBORS SAY?

12:11.700 --> 12:13.633
- FINE.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.467
HE CAN MOVE INTO THE GARAGE.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.200
- WHAT? MA, COME ON!
THE GARAGE?

12:17.233 --> 12:18.500
THERE'S SPIDERS IN THERE.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.133
UNCLE DONNY DIED IN THERE!

12:20.166 --> 12:22.000
[microwave beeping]

12:22.033 --> 12:24.734
- GET OUT OF HERE!

12:24.767 --> 12:26.000
- I TOLD YOU IT WOULDN'T WORK.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.233
- IT DID WORK, YOU DUMMY!

12:27.266 --> 12:28.633
YOU JUST COULDN'T KEEP
YOUR BIG MOUTH SHUT.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.734
GOD, BRUCE, YOU'RE LIKE THE
EXXON VALDEZ OF PEOPLE.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.367
- I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BEFORE.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.633
OH, WELL, WE TRIED.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.600
TELL MAGGIE I'LL SEE HER
ON MONDAY FOR COUNSELING.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.200
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

12:38.233 --> 12:41.000
OKAY, LISTEN, THERE IS
NO PROBLEM THAT I CANNOT SOLVE.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.300
ALL RIGHT?
I JUST NEED SOME MORE TIME.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.000
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT

12:44.033 --> 12:45.266
IN THE STORAGE UNIT,
ALL RIGHT?

12:45.300 --> 12:47.133
- THAT'S FINE BECAUSE
I FALL ASLEEP TO THE SOUND

12:47.166 --> 12:48.700
OF THESE LITTLE PIGEONS
TIP-TAP-TAPPING ON THE--

12:48.734 --> 12:51.300
- WOULD YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH?
- YEAH.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.100
- HEY, CANDY, IT'S BEEN
A ROUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE.

13:01.133 --> 13:02.367
CAN YOU GIVE ME
SOMETHING STRONG?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.200
- ONE MUDSLIDE
COMIN' RIGHT UP.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.633
- THANK YOU.
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN MAGGIE?

13:05.667 --> 13:07.600
SHE TEXTED ME.
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET HER HERE.

13:07.633 --> 13:12.166
- YOU CAN PUT THAT ON MY TAB,
CANDY.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.266
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.266
THIS IS NOT GOOD!

13:14.300 --> 13:15.333
- HEY, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.433
I DON'T WANT
ZACH TO HEAR US.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.734
- WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
AS BOSEPHUS?

13:17.767 --> 13:19.333
- ZACH TOLD ME
TO STAY OUT OF IT,

13:19.367 --> 13:21.000
SO THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM

13:21.033 --> 13:22.467
WAS THROUGH THE EYES
OF BOSEPHUS.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.333
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SNOOPING.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.600
SECONDLY, YOU ARE ACTING INSANE.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.300
ALL RIGHT,
THIS WAS FUNNY IN COLLEGE,

13:29.333 --> 13:31.467
BUT THIS IS CRAY-CRAY CRAZY.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.734
- YOU SAT RIGHT NEXT TO ME
AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS ME.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.367
- HERE YOU GO.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.667
- THANK YA KINDLY, CANDY.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.266
OOH, I LIKE THAT TIGHT TOP.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.700
IT HUGS YOU
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

13:40.734 --> 13:42.600
- EW!
- THANKS, MAGGIE.

13:42.633 --> 13:44.233
- SEE?
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

13:44.266 --> 13:45.600
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

13:45.633 --> 13:48.033
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
TILL I FINISH MY SCHLITZ.

13:48.066 --> 13:49.200
- HEY, DON'T YOU DRINK THAT!

13:49.233 --> 13:50.433
YOU ARE PREGNANT!

13:50.467 --> 13:51.767
- COME ON, IT'S JUST
APPLE JUICE, SILLY.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.100
WILL YOU PUT THIS BANDANA ON?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.033
- WHAT?
- PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD.

13:55.066 --> 13:56.567
- I'M GONNA RUIN
A PERFECTLY GOOD BLOWOUT.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.367
- NOBODY CARES.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.367
- GOD.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.266
THIS IS SO WEIRD

14:01.300 --> 14:03.233
AND INAPPROPRIATE
AND WEIRD.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.100
- SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

14:05.133 --> 14:06.767
- WHAT?
OH, MY GOD.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.633
I WAS RIGHT.
FAT DUDE.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.233
HE PROBABLY HAS
AN INVERTED WIENER.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.367
- BOSEPHUS GOT THIS.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.500
- NO, NO, NO!

14:12.533 --> 14:13.500
- HEY, BUDDY!

14:13.533 --> 14:15.000
YOU BETTER BACK OFF,

14:15.033 --> 14:16.767
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET
A MOUTHFUL OF FIST, YOU HEAR ME?

14:17.000 --> 14:20.233
- I JUST WANTED TO BORROW
THE KETCHUP.

14:20.266 --> 14:21.500
- OH, MY APOLOGIES, SIR.

14:21.533 --> 14:26.166
WHY DON'T YOU HELP YOURSELF
TO THE TOMATO SAUCE,

14:26.200 --> 14:28.033
AND ENJOY YOUR FRIES, FRIEND.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.033
- THANK YOU, SIR.

14:29.066 --> 14:30.700
- MAGGIE?

14:30.734 --> 14:31.700
EMMA?

14:31.734 --> 14:33.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:33.033 --> 14:34.533
- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE OKAY.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.000
- YOU'RE SPYING ON ME?

14:36.033 --> 14:37.266
- YEAH,
BUT ONLY TO PROTECT YOU.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.367
- I DON'T NEED YOU
TO PROTECT ME!

14:39.400 --> 14:41.667
- WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS--
- ZACH?

14:41.700 --> 14:43.133
- CECILIA.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.767
- I AM SO SORRY I'M LATE.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.767
MY ELDERLY NEIGHBOR
NEEDED A RIDE TO THE PHARMACY

14:47.000 --> 14:47.767
TO PICK UP HIS PRESCRIPTION.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.100
- OH, MY GOD.

14:49.133 --> 14:52.266
SHE'S EVEN BETTER-LOOKING
IN GLASSES.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.166
- ARE THESE YOUR FRIENDS?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.166
OH, I'D LOVE TO MEET THEM.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.233
WHY DON'T YOU TWO JOIN US?

14:56.266 --> 14:57.667
- OH, NO,
WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY--

14:57.700 --> 14:59.600
- OH, WE'D LOVE TO, ANGEL.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.133
MY NAME IS BOSEPHUS,

15:02.166 --> 15:06.266
AND THIS HERE
IS MY LOVER JANDANA.

15:23.734 --> 15:26.533
- WELL...

15:26.567 --> 15:29.567
CECILIA, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL ME SOME MORE

15:29.600 --> 15:31.200
ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL SELF?

15:31.233 --> 15:34.333
YOU KNOW, I ONLY KNOW
WHAT LITTLE ZACH HAS TOLD ME,

15:34.367 --> 15:37.033
AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW
WHAT A GORGEOUS CATALOG MODEL

15:37.066 --> 15:39.734
IS DOING TROLLING THE INTERNET
FOR A MAN.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.734
- OKAY, THAT'S
A VERY LOADED QUESTION.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.333
- NO, COME ON,
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

15:43.367 --> 15:45.533
WHAT A WOMAN
WITH SUCH GOOD TOP BITS

15:45.567 --> 15:47.600
IS DOING
ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.600
THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE,
YOU KNOW?

15:49.633 --> 15:51.700
I THINK THEY'D BE KNOCKING
DOWN YOUR DOOR.

15:51.734 --> 15:54.200
"HELLO, CECILIA, CAN I COME IN?

15:54.233 --> 15:56.266
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY TYPE,"
YOU KNOW?

15:56.300 --> 15:58.133
SHE DON'T NEED TO GO LOOKING
FOR THEM.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.166
THEY LOOKIN' FOR HER.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.633
- OKAY, THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE.

16:00.667 --> 16:01.734
I TOLD YOU WHO SHE WAS.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.500
SHE'S EXACTLY WHO I SAID
SHE WOULD BE.

16:03.533 --> 16:04.700
PLEASE.
- COME ON!

16:04.734 --> 16:06.633
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO SENSITIVE?

16:06.667 --> 16:10.633
- BOSEPHUS, HONEY,
WE SHOULD BE GETTIN' ON THE GET

16:10.667 --> 16:13.667
AND LETTIN' THESE YUNG'UNS
GET TO THEIR MINGLIN'.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.266
- DON'T RUSH ME, WOMAN!

16:15.300 --> 16:17.033
I'M TRYIN' TO FINISH MY SCHLITZ!

16:17.066 --> 16:19.066
I SAID IT OVER THERE.
I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.734
I JUST WANT
TO HAVE A GODDAMN BEER.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.300
- EXCUSE ME.
- I WORK HARD!

16:22.333 --> 16:23.633
- I DON'T LIKE THAT ATTITUDE.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.100
- WELL,
I DON'T LIKE YOUR PANTS.

16:25.133 --> 16:26.567
OKAY, ANYWAY,
I'M JUST GETTIN' STARTED

16:26.600 --> 16:28.100
WITH MY FRIEND'S NEW LADY HERE.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.467
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.066
IN FACT, I'D PREFER NOT
TO SEE YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.233
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

16:34.266 --> 16:36.100
YOU'D PREFER NOT
TO SEE MY FACE?

16:36.133 --> 16:38.233
- BOSEPHUS,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO, YOU KNOW,

16:38.266 --> 16:41.533
AND GET YOU HOME
TO WATCH YOUR JAG ON THE VHS.

16:41.567 --> 16:46.033
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
TAKE THAT HAT OFF.

16:46.066 --> 16:48.133
- CECILIA,
I AM NOT BOSEPHUS.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.400
I AM MAGGIE.
I AM ZACH'S SISTER.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.400
AND I AM INCREDIBLY
EMBARRASSED.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.100
- IT'S OKAY.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.633
I KNEW THAT YOU WERE A WOMAN.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.734
I WAS REALLY JUST TRYING
TO BE POLITE,

16:57.767 --> 16:59.000
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A MAN.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.000
- WAIT, WHAT?

17:00.033 --> 17:01.066
NO, I'M A WOMAN.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.333
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.500
- IS IT THE SHOULDERS?
WHAT ARE WE--

17:04.533 --> 17:06.266
- I THINK, TO BE HONEST,

17:06.300 --> 17:09.100
WE JUST SAW ALL THOSE
CATALOG PICS ON YOUR PROFILE,

17:09.133 --> 17:12.266
AND I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY

17:12.300 --> 17:14.100
THAT YOU WEREN'T, YOU KNOW,
AND THAT YOU WERE

17:14.133 --> 17:15.200
GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY BROTHER.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.433
- IT'S OKAY.
I HAVE A BROTHER TOO.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.700
I'M SURE HE WOULD
DO THE SAME THING.

17:18.734 --> 17:20.767
NOT EXACTLY THIS SAME THING.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.467
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA GO,

17:22.500 --> 17:25.033
AND I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS
HAVE A WONDERFUL DATE

17:25.066 --> 17:27.467
AND THAT YOU WILL NOT LET
ANY OF THIS REFLECT POORLY

17:27.500 --> 17:29.700
ON MY BROTHER, ZACH,
BECAUSE HE IS AN AMAZING MAN

17:29.734 --> 17:32.166
AND, FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
AN INCREDIBLE LOVER.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.533
- I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY,
BECAUSE UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

17:34.567 --> 17:36.266
WE'VE BEEN SWIMMING IN LIES.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.333
- COME ON, EM. LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

17:40.367 --> 17:43.033
OH, BY THE WAY, CAN I GET
THOSE KNEE SOCKS IN THE STORE,

17:43.066 --> 17:44.200
OR DO YOU HAVE TO GET 'EM
ONLINE?

17:44.233 --> 17:45.533
- OH, I'M JUST A MODEL.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:45.567 --> 17:46.700
- OKAY, BECAUSE I CALLED,

17:46.734 --> 17:48.433
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"IT'S ON BACK ORDER"--

17:48.467 --> 17:49.667
OKAY. SORRY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.166
ALL RIGHT.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:56.467 --> 17:57.667
- I THINK IT'S AMAZING!

17:57.700 --> 17:58.767
ARE YOU JOKING ME?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.200
LOOK AT THIS STUFF!
- YEP.

18:00.233 --> 18:01.233
- THE SCROLLS!

18:01.266 --> 18:02.433
- AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.133
MY SHOJI SCREEN DOES A GOOD JOB
OF COVERING UP

18:04.166 --> 18:05.400
THAT CLOSET
THAT GOES TO NOWHERE.

18:05.433 --> 18:06.567
- I LOVE
ALL THIS ORIENTAL STUFF.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.166
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S A BIT RACIST.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.066
NOW, THE FIRST MONTH'S RENT
IS PAID,

18:10.100 --> 18:11.667
BUT WHEN YOU GET
YOUR NEXT CONSTRUCTION GIG,

18:11.700 --> 18:12.734
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME BACK,
DEAL?

18:12.767 --> 18:15.066
- DEAL.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.734
- THIS IS THE NICEST THING
THAT ANYONE'S EVER DONE FOR ME.

18:16.767 --> 18:19.000
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.467
I WANT TO LEAVE.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.233
OH, GOD.

18:23.266 --> 18:25.600
OKAY.
- OKAY.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.066
- YOU KNOW I STILL HATE YOU,
RIGHT?

18:27.100 --> 18:28.166
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.066
- OH!

18:32.100 --> 18:34.633
HEY, YOU DOIN' A LITTLE JIG
ON MY CERVIX?

18:34.667 --> 18:36.433
[laughing]

18:36.467 --> 18:38.200
SETTLE DOWN NOW.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.033
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M FINE.

18:40.066 --> 18:41.066
- OH, MY GOD, ZACH!

18:41.100 --> 18:42.767
- I JUST NEED FLUIDS.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.233
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:44.266 --> 18:45.233
- UGH, CHICKEN BROTH.

18:45.266 --> 18:46.300
- OH, THAT'S CHICKEN BROTH.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.367
- THAT'S CHICKEN BROTH.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.734
- ARE YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANT SOME WATER?

18:48.767 --> 18:50.600
- I'M FINE.
I NEED TO RESALINATE.

18:50.633 --> 18:51.734
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:51.767 --> 18:54.166
- CECILIA.
- OH, I KNEW IT!

18:54.200 --> 18:56.233
WHERE IS SHE?
I'LL CUT A BITCH. I'LL CUT HER!

18:56.266 --> 18:59.300
- LAST NIGHT, AFTER SOME
PRETTY INTENSE HEAVY-PETTING

18:59.333 --> 19:01.767
WHICH, CHARADE OR NO CHARADE,
SHE WAS DEFINITELY INTO--

19:02.000 --> 19:03.100
- SKIP TO THE NEXT PART.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.166
- NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE'S RANSACKING ME.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.333
SHE TAKES OUT MY WALLET.
SHE TAKES EVERYTHING OUT OF IT--

19:07.367 --> 19:08.600
- SHE TOOK ALL YOUR MONEY?

19:08.633 --> 19:10.300
- YEAH, AND SHE KICKED ME
INTO A DRAINAGE DITCH.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.500
[snaps fingers]

19:11.533 --> 19:13.133
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I'M ON HER!

19:13.166 --> 19:15.500
GONNA GET THE POLICE,
THE FBI, WHOEVER ELSE--

19:15.533 --> 19:18.367
I'LL ROUND 'EM UP, AND WE'LL
TAKE CARE OF THIS HARLOT.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.467
- NO NEED.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.066
MY CAR BROKE DOWN OUTSIDE
OF NORWICH,

19:21.100 --> 19:22.333
AND THE POLICE ARRESTED HER.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.000
APPARENTLY SHE DOES THIS
ALL THE TIME.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.000
- WHAT?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.266
- YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

19:26.300 --> 19:28.000
WHO GIVE THE INTERNET
A BAD NAME.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.467
- I'M SORRY.
THAT IS HORRIBLE.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.100
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE WORST.

19:31.133 --> 19:32.734
- IT WAS LITERALLY
THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

19:32.767 --> 19:33.734
- WHAT?

19:33.767 --> 19:36.300
- I FEEL AFLAME WITH PASSION

19:36.333 --> 19:38.700
AND DANGER AND ANGER
AND RESENTMENT

19:38.734 --> 19:41.200
BUT ALSO JOY AND GRATITUDE.

19:41.233 --> 19:46.033
- HEY, BUDDY, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY BEHAVIOR,

19:46.066 --> 19:47.567
MY ERRATIC BEHAVIOR LAST NIGHT.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.233
THAT WAS NOT COOL

19:49.266 --> 19:51.000
AND ALSO
A LITTLE MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.266
- YES, IT WAS.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.500
- YOU KNOW, I JUST--

19:54.533 --> 19:57.266
I THINK EVER SINCE
MOM AND DAD DIED, I JUST...

19:57.300 --> 19:59.100
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING BAD
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.333
- AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

20:02.367 --> 20:03.533
YOU LOOKING OUT FOR ME,

20:03.567 --> 20:05.367
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER LITTLE WEIRDO

20:05.400 --> 20:07.166
TO LOOK OUT FOR SOON.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.166
- YEAH.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.433
I KNOW, ZACH.

20:10.467 --> 20:13.400
- YOU CAN CALL ME ZOO,
MAGPIE.

20:13.433 --> 20:16.300
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.467
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SUCH A GREAT MOM.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.300
- THANKS, BUDDY.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.000
- JUST DON'T DRESS UP
LIKE A CRAZY TRUCKER

20:22.033 --> 20:24.166
AND STALK YOUR DAUGHTER
WHEN SHE STARTS DATING.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.100
- I CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.767
LANG-DANG, DIGGY-DIGGY.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.166
- NO.
- WHOO!

20:30.200 --> 20:32.000
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HIT THE LAKE

20:32.033 --> 20:34.033
AND SET EVERYTHING ON FIRE?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.033
- SET A LAKE ON FIRE?

20:35.066 --> 20:37.133
- WHOO, YEAH!

20:37.166 --> 20:38.133
WHOO!

20:38.166 --> 20:39.400
- HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.533
UGH!
TERRIBLE.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.433
- MAGGIE, IT'S TIME.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.200
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.400
THERE'S A PART OF ME

20:54.433 --> 20:58.433
THAT'S GONNA MISS
GOOD OL' BOSEPHUS.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.233
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

21:00.266 --> 21:02.133
- I'VE GOT TO.

21:02.166 --> 21:05.233
BOSEPHUS IS JUST SIMPLY
TOO POWERFUL.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.300
- STOP. SHH.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.600
[cell phone twinkles]
- WHOA.

21:09.633 --> 21:10.600
- WHAT? COME ON.

21:10.633 --> 21:13.000
- WAIT.
- GET SERIOUS.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.333
- OH, MY GOD.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.467
BRUCE IS DROPPING HIS REQUEST
FOR COUPLE'S COUNSELING.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.100
- WOW, I WONDER WHY
HE WOULD DO THAT.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.600
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE'S GROWING UP A LITTLE.

21:20.633 --> 21:22.700
- MM, I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT,
BUT...

21:22.734 --> 21:25.066
- WELL, CAN'T BURN THIS NOW

21:25.100 --> 21:26.500
'CAUSE IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE!

21:26.533 --> 21:27.734
NOW COME ON DOWN!

21:27.767 --> 21:29.700
- NO! NO! NO!
- DANCE GIRL, DANCE!

21:29.734 --> 21:30.767
NO! BOSEPHUS!

21:31.000 --> 21:33.500
NO!

21:33.533 --> 21:35.633
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.100
HE'S GONE NOW.
BOSEPHUS IS DEAD.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.500
- HE WAS MY EVERYTHING!

21:38.533 --> 21:41.100
- HE'S DEAD NOW.
HE CAN'T HURT US ANYMORE.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.367
- EXCEPT HE'S INSIDE OF ME.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.734
- [sighs]

21:44.767 --> 21:46.467
- HE'S STILL INSIDE OF ME!

21:46.500 --> 21:48.266
- I'M GOING TO BED.
- WHOO!

21:48.300 --> 21:51.300
GIRL, COME ON AND PARTY
WITH THE CRAWDADS!

21:51.333 --> 21:52.700
COME ON DOWN THE CRICK!

21:52.734 --> 21:54.233
