headlines regarding his pursuit
of buried treasure connected

01:49.292 --> 01:53.375
to the early 19th century
French privateer Louis Aury.

Yeah, well, this one
is gonna be cool.

I always have high hopes,

to this Captain Joe,

02:00.417 --> 02:03.167

all this research

02:03.292 --> 02:06.042
and classic, you know,
hours and hours and hours.

MARTY:
He's looking for treasure

02:12.167 --> 02:14.958
that was hidden away
by the pirate Captain Aury.

02:15.042 --> 02:16.542
He's just about to dig
and the authorities say,

02:16.708 --> 02:18.667
"No, no, you can't dig
without an archaeologist."

02:18.833 --> 02:20.542
So, you remember Dr. Taylor?

02:20.667 --> 02:22.167
-Of course.
-Yeah.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.958
Great archaeologist,

-"Well, we can help out."
-Love it.

02:25.958 --> 02:27.542

02:51.917 --> 02:53.333
NARRATOR:
Originally from Ohio,

02:53.458 --> 02:56.000
Joe Zsiga worked
for more than 30 years

02:56.125 --> 02:58.458
as a successful
air conditioning contractor

02:58.542 --> 03:03.292
in Tampa, Florida
before retiring in 2021.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.333

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
he has enjoyed secondary
careers as a boat captain

03:08.625 --> 03:11.208
and now, a fulltime
treasure hunter.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.458
JOE:
I grew up in a small town
near Cleveland, Ohio.

03:15.542 --> 03:18.625
I was always adventurous
when I was growing up as a kid,

03:18.750 --> 03:21.458
and exploring was
in my nature and blood.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.667
Treasure hunting
started as a hobby.

03:24.792 --> 03:29.333
When I discovered Louis Aury
and that he actually was here

03:29.458 --> 03:32.917
in the bay area,
that changed everything.

03:33.042 --> 03:35.333
And that was the moment

03:35.417 --> 03:37.708
that turned me from
part-time treasure hunter

03:37.875 --> 03:40.208
to full-time treasure hunter.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.750
NARRATOR:
Also joining the meeting today

03:42.875 --> 03:46.000
are Joe's friend and research
partner Mike Gattuso,

03:46.125 --> 03:50.667
as well as Nova Scotia based
archaeologist Dr. Aaron Taylor.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.125
Captain, before
we hear the specifics

03:52.250 --> 03:53.833
of what we're doing

03:53.958 --> 03:56.208
and what you have in mind
for this particular search,

03:56.375 --> 03:59.083
like, I'm just curious,
why this hunt?

03:59.208 --> 04:02.333
Like, what about
this particular character

04:02.500 --> 04:04.250
and this hunt
was alluring to you?

04:04.375 --> 04:05.500
Why this one?

04:05.625 --> 04:07.000
JOE:
Well, here's the thing:

04:07.125 --> 04:08.708
-I'm a history nut.
-MARTY: Okay.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.500
-Now we're getting to it.
-JOE: And the history part of it

04:10.667 --> 04:12.833
intrigues me to the point
where, you know,

04:12.958 --> 04:14.750
I'll be that guy
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning

04:14.875 --> 04:17.333
just searching any documents
that I can come across

04:17.417 --> 04:19.792
from the Library of Congress
or wherever.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.500
-MARTY: Hmm.
-And that's how
my journey started.

04:22.667 --> 04:26.417
This led me
to Louis-Michel Aury.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.042
NARRATOR:
Born in Paris, France in 1788,

04:31.167 --> 04:33.250
Louis Aury joined
the French Navy,

04:33.375 --> 04:35.583
serving on privateer ships

04:35.708 --> 04:38.125
beginning when he was
just 14 years old.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.458
A natural sailor and leader,

04:41.583 --> 04:43.333
within eight years,
Aury became the master

04:43.417 --> 04:45.333
of his own fleet of ships.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.208
However, he was also moved

04:47.333 --> 04:49.333
by the plight
of the indigenous people

04:49.417 --> 04:51.417
in Central America

04:51.542 --> 04:53.292
who had been colonized
by the Spanish,

04:53.417 --> 04:55.375
and took part
in numerous revolutions,

04:55.500 --> 04:57.792
even forging an alliance

04:57.875 --> 05:01.500
with Venezuelan
revolutionary Simón Bolívar.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.167
MOSS:
In the early 1800s,
you started to see

05:04.333 --> 05:05.875
some of the Spanish republics
in the New World,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.500
in the Americas,

05:07.625 --> 05:09.250
start to rebel back
against Spain,

05:09.375 --> 05:11.583
and fight back
for their own independence.

05:11.708 --> 05:14.583
And Aury himself got swept up
in this rebellion.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.375
And would oftentimes,
even though he was French,

05:16.500 --> 05:18.042
and maybe because he was French,

05:18.208 --> 05:21.167
um, he would fight
against the Spanish,

05:21.333 --> 05:24.833
um, in order to liberate
areas like Mexico,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.500
Guatemala, Panama.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.542
It just made him a really
fascinating character.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.542
NARRATOR:
By 1815,

05:31.667 --> 05:35.667
Aury returned to privateering,
plundering Spanish ships

05:35.750 --> 05:39.833
from his base on Amelia Island
off the west coast of Florida.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.708
MOSS:
He made a tremendous
amount of money.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.625
Estimates have it
being over $500,000

05:45.708 --> 05:48.417
of 1818 money,

05:48.542 --> 05:52.083
which is the equivalent
of five billion dollars today.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.958
Five billion dollars, with a B.

05:54.042 --> 05:56.750
What he did with that money,
we're not quite sure.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.167
NARRATOR:
In 1817,

05:59.292 --> 06:01.667
as the United States
led a campaign

06:01.792 --> 06:04.458
to eliminate privateering
off the Florida coast,

06:04.583 --> 06:06.625
Louis Aury
is believed to have buried

06:06.750 --> 06:08.417
much of his plundered treasure

06:08.542 --> 06:10.750
in numerous caches
at different locations.

06:11.625 --> 06:15.042
In 1821, he suffered
an untimely death

06:15.167 --> 06:17.208
after being thrown
from his horse,

06:17.375 --> 06:18.750
leaving the fate
of the immense wealth

06:18.875 --> 06:21.750
he is reported
to have accumulated unknown.

06:21.875 --> 06:25.250
However, Joe Zsiga
and Michael Gattuso

06:25.375 --> 06:26.625
believe they have found

06:26.708 --> 06:29.083
where Aury hid several
of the treasure deposits

06:29.208 --> 06:33.000
with the help of indigenous
allies near Anclote, Florida.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.917
Well, I'm curious,
Captain, like,

06:36.042 --> 06:38.417
what happened that set you
on this particular search.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.833
Did you find something?
And-and where were you?

06:40.958 --> 06:42.917
Well, it started with

06:43.042 --> 06:46.208
Michael finding
the record that we needed.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.958
-Hmm.
-Okay.

06:48.042 --> 06:50.167
A few months ago, I had done
some extensive research

06:50.292 --> 06:52.083
at the University
of South Florida,

06:52.208 --> 06:54.000
so I wanted to see if possibly
this treasure might have been

06:54.083 --> 06:55.208
in one of these archives.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.333
So, as I'm looking,

06:56.500 --> 06:57.375
I find this little snippet,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.333
like an article of historians

06:59.417 --> 07:01.542
that had done research
on different treasures.

07:01.667 --> 07:05.167
And I see that it says,
"Captain Louis Curry,"

07:05.292 --> 07:07.042
but it had question marks.

07:08.042 --> 07:10.208
So anybody that's not really...
who's looking to treasure hunt

07:10.333 --> 07:11.583
and look at that,
wouldn't even realize

07:11.708 --> 07:13.375
that's not even the right
spelling of the name.

07:13.542 --> 07:14.458
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.
-Just from the fact

07:14.583 --> 07:15.792
that he had told me,

07:15.875 --> 07:17.292
the last name being Aury,
it clicked.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.167
It's actually
Captain Louis Aury,

07:19.333 --> 07:20.333
they just misunderstood
the last name.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
Okay, makes sense.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.333
Because one thing I've learned

07:23.458 --> 07:24.458
on this journey--
when you talk about symbology--

07:24.542 --> 07:26.125
one of the techniques that

07:26.250 --> 07:27.833
these depositors will leave

07:27.958 --> 07:29.917
is slight misspellings
of names.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.542
-Correct.
-MATTY: To throw
someone like you

07:31.667 --> 07:33.000
-off the case.
-Correct.
-Mm-hmm.

07:33.125 --> 07:36.542
So it's making it
very exciting for me, because...

07:36.708 --> 07:38.500
I think
there's something there.

07:39.708 --> 07:42.458
The document that I have
tells a little story about...

07:42.542 --> 07:43.750
Louis-Michel Aury

07:43.875 --> 07:46.333
and six trusted
Native Americans.

07:46.417 --> 07:49.208
Late at night,
they went to this well

07:49.333 --> 07:51.042
-to stash his treasure.
-Yeah.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.625
And supposedly, he had buried

07:53.708 --> 07:56.792
11 caches around this well
which were ten feet apart.

07:56.917 --> 07:58.417
So that's where, actually,
we're targeting.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.667
And this thing said that?

07:59.833 --> 08:00.917
GATUSSO:
Yes.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.167
MARTY:
Said 11 treasures
ten feet apart?

08:02.333 --> 08:03.333
-GATUSSO: Yes.
-MARTY: Okay.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.500
GATUSSO:
You know, a lot of times

08:04.625 --> 08:05.833
when you do a lot of research

08:06.000 --> 08:07.417
on these pirates
and these stories,

08:07.542 --> 08:08.792
it's a story

08:08.917 --> 08:10.583
when you don't have
a treasure map.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.125
But with a treasure map,
now you do have something.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.542
-Yeah.
-GATUSSO: So we have
a very strong possibility

08:13.708 --> 08:15.167
that nobody else
has probably looked

08:15.292 --> 08:16.667
for this treasure.

08:16.833 --> 08:19.500
So here's Honeymoon Island.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.292
This is actually
the east side of the island.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.167
And in this dense forest here

08:24.250 --> 08:26.667
is where Aury lived.

08:26.833 --> 08:31.333
The research leads us into
the story of a spring well.

08:31.417 --> 08:34.667
Well, then, obviously,
looking at all the data,

08:34.833 --> 08:38.833
we see that there are only
two spring wells in this area.

08:38.958 --> 08:42.833
One is Wall Springs and one
is the Spanish Well at Anclote.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.042
Well, Wall Springs,
this water in here,

08:45.208 --> 08:46.500
you can't get a boat in.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.250
As you can plainly see,
the sand here,

08:49.375 --> 08:51.500
it's too shallow
and the well is actually

08:51.625 --> 08:54.250
a quarter of a mile inland.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.625
So there's no way you could get

08:55.708 --> 08:57.417
heavy barrels
in and out of there.

08:57.542 --> 08:58.458
So you kind of
eliminate that one?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.000
JOE:
So that's eliminated.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.625
And then we went to
the Spanish Well at Anclote.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.000
GATUSSO:
And then,

09:04.083 --> 09:05.833
there's three things
for the pirates normally

09:05.958 --> 09:08.375
you have to keep an eye on,
which is markings on trees--

09:08.500 --> 09:10.167
which at the time, the hurricane

09:10.292 --> 09:12.208
probably knocked these trees
down so we couldn't find

09:12.333 --> 09:14.208
any markings--
high ground,

09:14.375 --> 09:16.667
and the landmark.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.708
So we had the high ground,
we couldn't find the markings,

09:18.875 --> 09:21.125
but there was also a landmark.

09:21.208 --> 09:24.500
That adds up to a possible
location of a treasure.

09:24.583 --> 09:25.958
-So...
-The landmark is the well.

09:26.042 --> 09:27.292
-GATUSSO: Right.
-The Spanish Well.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.375
-Yes.
-And then, of course,

09:29.500 --> 09:30.833
the further research
dictated that there were

09:30.958 --> 09:33.542
11 caches buried
in plain sight around it.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.500
MATTY:
Amazing.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.458
So, then what did you do?

09:37.583 --> 09:40.000
-We GPR'd it.
-(laughter)
-What a shock.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.333
Mm-hmm.

09:41.458 --> 09:42.958
-MATTY: And?
-GATUSSO: That's where...

09:43.083 --> 09:44.875
We found 11 of them.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.542
-Really? Right where
they should be?
-Wow.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.333
-Yes, sir.
-MATTY: Now that's interesting.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.708
Okay, I have to ask.
I have to ask.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.292
How much money could this be?
What's it worth?

09:54.417 --> 09:56.500
-In today's money?
-Yeah.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.333
Approximately $140 million.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.000
MARTY:-JOE: Ahh!
That's worth a look, huh, Matty?

10:06.167 --> 10:07.417
I heard that.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.458
I'll dig a hole
for that potential.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.125
NARRATOR: In Tampa,
Florida, Marty Lagina

10:12.208 --> 10:15.500
and Matty Blake are preparing
to join treasure hunter

10:15.583 --> 10:18.542
Joe Zsiga in his quest
to find a buried treasure

10:18.708 --> 10:20.333
believed to be connected

10:20.458 --> 10:24.333
to the early 19th-century
French privateer, Louis Aury.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.625
What does this
Spanish Well look like?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.750
What... Is it,
is it a deep well?

10:28.875 --> 10:30.750
Is it a big well?
Do you bail the water out of it?

10:30.875 --> 10:33.750
It's...
In 1948, a young child

10:33.875 --> 10:35.333
-fell in that well.
-Oh, okay.

10:35.458 --> 10:36.750
So they cemented it up

10:36.875 --> 10:39.458
and they, you know,
rebarred it and whatever,

10:39.542 --> 10:40.917
so no further children

10:41.042 --> 10:42.792
could have any dangers
of falling in it.

10:42.875 --> 10:46.500
So now it's covered over
and just got lost in time.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.250
-MARTY: It's in sand, no?
-It's in sand.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.333
This is a county park, correct?

10:50.458 --> 10:52.083
JOE:
Yes, it's a county park.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.083
MARTY:
Because you got stymied
initially from--

10:53.208 --> 10:54.417
Initially, yes.

10:54.542 --> 10:56.917
I've applied permit after permit

10:57.042 --> 11:00.000
and the same person
that works there

11:00.083 --> 11:01.833
-turns me down.
-MARTY: Right.

11:01.958 --> 11:04.500
-But they wanted
an archaeologist.
-JOE: Yes.

11:04.583 --> 11:07.125
Well, enter Doctor Taylor
here and, uh,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.042
are you up to speed?

11:09.167 --> 11:11.250
I'm becoming more
and more up to speed.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.000
Um, you know, I'm generally
a skeptical person.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.375
MARTY: Mm-hmm.
-And I get contacted

11:15.542 --> 11:17.667
fairly frequently
about possible treasure.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.833
-Of course.
-And, um,

11:19.917 --> 11:22.000
usually it doesn't get past
the rumor stage, you know?

11:22.125 --> 11:24.208
Someone has an old story
that's been passed down,

11:24.375 --> 11:27.458
and, um, you know,
I thank you for contacting me,

11:27.542 --> 11:28.833
but I'll pass.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.375
When Marty contacted me
with this story,

11:31.500 --> 11:34.250
and I got a chance to speak
with Captain Joe here,

11:34.375 --> 11:35.875
it was more than a rumor.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.458
He had done archival research,
they had brought in GPR

11:39.542 --> 11:41.250
that showed anomalies.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.958
And having the state involved,

11:43.042 --> 11:46.500
the State of Florida involved
and a permit in place,

11:46.667 --> 11:48.417
I was, you know,

11:48.542 --> 11:52.542
more-more than compelled
and happy to join the team.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.000
With him coming on board,

11:54.167 --> 11:56.083
-you've got your permits.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.542
Yeah.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.667
I spoke to the Florida
State officials,

11:59.792 --> 12:02.625
um, and we've discussed
what needs to be done.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.875
With treasure hunting,
any time you go into the ground,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.625
you destroy the site,
essentially.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.625
And Captain Joe
and Mike's research

12:10.708 --> 12:13.542
showed that First Nations
were helping

12:13.708 --> 12:16.458
Captain Aury at that time,

12:16.542 --> 12:18.125
so a really important point is,

12:18.250 --> 12:21.000
if you hit
a First Nations artifact,

12:21.167 --> 12:22.667
-you really have to stop.
-Mm-hmm.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.042
And contact government
officials in Florida

12:25.167 --> 12:26.500
to see how they want to proceed.

12:26.625 --> 12:27.500
All right.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.000
Awesome.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.458
MARTY:
Okay, so we want to dig,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.000
but first we're
going to reverify

12:32.125 --> 12:34.667
-these positions, correct?
-Yes.

12:34.792 --> 12:37.167
You know, the enthusiasm
is pretty palpable here.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.958
Are we all set with
equipment and such?

12:39.042 --> 12:41.333
-We brought everything we need.
-MARTY: Okay.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.667
-Good.
-JOE: I have people
there right now

12:43.750 --> 12:45.417
prepping for us.

12:45.542 --> 12:48.167
So they'll be all ready
to accept us when we get there.

12:48.292 --> 12:51.458
Well, we're burning daylight.
Let's go find the old well.

12:51.542 --> 12:52.708
-AARON: Let's go.
-I agree.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.667
MATTY:
Let's find some gold.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.667
♪ ♪

12:57.750 --> 13:00.333
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

13:00.458 --> 13:03.292
-MARTY: All right guys,
this looks like it.
-MATTY: All right.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.667
NARRATOR:
...Marty and Matty,
along with Joe

13:05.792 --> 13:07.208
and the rest of their team,

13:07.333 --> 13:09.958
have traveled some 30 miles
northwest of Tampa

13:10.083 --> 13:13.417
to Anclote River Park
in Holiday, Florida.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.708
-Hey, guys.
-MARTY: Howdy.

13:14.833 --> 13:15.750
Let me introduce you
to everybody.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.042
-I'm Marty.
-I'm Erin.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.417
NARRATOR:
There they are joined

13:18.542 --> 13:20.667
by metal detection experts

13:20.792 --> 13:22.792
Chris Liebert and Erin Melcher.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.875
-You guys know how to dig?
-Eh.

13:25.042 --> 13:26.667
-We've done it once or twice.
-MARTY: (laughs) Good.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.375
-Good.
-JOE: Well, if you're
ready to dig,

13:28.500 --> 13:31.375
-we're going that way.
-ERIN: Let's go. Let's go.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.542
NARRATOR:
In order to confirm
the locations

13:33.708 --> 13:36.333
of the 11 possible treasure
caches that Mike and Joe

13:36.500 --> 13:38.208
previously detected

13:38.333 --> 13:40.833
in this area, they will
first need to identify

13:41.000 --> 13:43.792
the site of the buried
Spanish Well.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.500
Once that is accomplished,

13:45.667 --> 13:47.000
Mike will then scan

13:47.125 --> 13:49.875
for the most shallow
and reachable targets

13:50.000 --> 13:53.875
using the Nokta Makro ground
penetrating radar device.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.958
By emitting magnetic
pulses into the ground,

13:57.042 --> 13:58.917
the unit is able to identify

13:59.042 --> 14:01.708
possible buried
structures or objects.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.583
However, the Nokta Makro
has capabilities

14:04.708 --> 14:07.000
that make it ideal
for treasure hunting.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.833
GATUSSO:
The GPR actually gives me depth,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.333
it gives me the type of metal

14:10.417 --> 14:12.250
and how valuable it is,
whether it's gold

14:12.375 --> 14:14.917
or any different types
of metals as well.

14:15.042 --> 14:18.375
I think what we want to do first
is we want to start out

14:18.500 --> 14:19.750
right in the center.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.833
Let's see if--
that we can locate

14:22.917 --> 14:25.000
the actual position of the well.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.250
And then, we can go
on a circumference

14:27.375 --> 14:30.125
-of what the clues were
in a circle.
-MARTY: Yes.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.167
-MATTY: Great.
-So I think we start
right in this area

14:32.250 --> 14:34.000
-right here, guys.
-MARTY: Yeah,
let's find the well.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.292
MATTY:
The first thing that
this team wants to do

14:36.375 --> 14:37.875
is identify the well,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.750
because according
to Joe's research,

14:40.875 --> 14:43.167
the treasure caches
were laid out around

14:43.292 --> 14:45.250
wherever this well was,
historically.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.333
So if we can find
the well right now,

14:47.458 --> 14:50.542
we can start measuring out
and try to find these hits.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.042
Like, right here,

14:52.208 --> 14:53.750
I'm actually getting
a signal right here.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.125
MATTY:
All right, let's spike it.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.542
Nope, still soft.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.417
There we go.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.208
Yeah, it dropped.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.167
So if it's any deeper
than that, it's not there.

15:06.292 --> 15:07.833
GATUSSO:
Here, Matty,
it was over here more.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.333
-MATTY: Okay.
-GATUSSO: Try over here.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.042
MATTY:
Copy that. Oh!

15:11.208 --> 15:13.792
-JOE: Ahh!
-ERIN: There it is.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.458
-Do we have a well?
-JOE: I think we have
a well, gentlemen.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.958
I think we have a well.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.458
MATTY:
That's shallow, you can just...

15:19.542 --> 15:21.042
JOE:
All right, well,
it would make sense,

15:21.208 --> 15:23.625
because they cemented it up
and rebarred it up.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.833
Just finding that well

15:25.917 --> 15:29.167
in itself is huge, because

15:29.250 --> 15:33.167
it does show us that
our previous locations

15:33.250 --> 15:35.292
were pretty much
right on the spot.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.625
-MATTY: Excellent.
-GATUSSO: That's a great find.

15:39.708 --> 15:41.208
-JOE: That's a great find.
-MATTY: Good job, fellas.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.667
Just find the edge
of it and then...

15:42.792 --> 15:43.833
AARON:
Yeah, that's what I'm just...

15:43.958 --> 15:46.000
just-just find the edge.

15:46.167 --> 15:51.042
So this gives you kind of,
like, the center of the wheel

15:51.208 --> 15:52.500
to look for your targets,

15:52.625 --> 15:54.167
-as like spokes off...
-Where our targets are

15:54.250 --> 15:56.208
in appropriation to the well.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.125
GATUSSO:
Well, we have a starting point.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.667
-JOE: Yes, we do.
-MATTY: Excellent.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.083
MARTY:
The first thing we do

16:01.208 --> 16:03.667
is find the cement cap
over the old well.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.542
That helps refine the search.

16:05.708 --> 16:08.042
That helps to add
further credence

16:08.208 --> 16:09.833
to the treasure deposits.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.875
GATUSSO:
What I'd really like
to do is, um,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.708
probably draw, like,
a line 15 feet around that.

16:15.833 --> 16:18.125
-Give me a better idea
of a radius.
-Yeah, okay, we can do that.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.167
18 is what I calculated it to,
if you want.

16:20.292 --> 16:22.000
GATUSSO:
That's even better,
we can do that.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.167
MARTY:
So my thought is,
"Hey, if we know

16:25.292 --> 16:29.333
"exactly where this well is now,
let's reverify

16:29.417 --> 16:31.083
these positions."

16:32.250 --> 16:34.292
Because if they are
in a circle,

16:34.375 --> 16:36.042
they will be
at the same distance.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.167
So I just kind of did
some mental arithmetic

16:38.292 --> 16:40.625
and figured the radius
would be about 18 feet

16:40.750 --> 16:44.833
to allow 10-foot spacing along
the circumference of a circle.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.333
MATTY:
It's a huge circle.

16:46.458 --> 16:47.500
GATUSSO:
So, I'm just gonna

16:47.625 --> 16:49.083
comb this whole thing.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.083
Seems to be pulling
a lot of iron.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.958
-MATTY: It's reading iron?
-GATUSSO: Yeah.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.125
-(GPR beeping)
-Oh, right here.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.542
MATTY:
Oh... Oh.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.583
-Oh, I like that.
-MARTY: Yeah, that sounds good.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.500
-MATTY: That's the best
sound we've heard.
-JOE: Wow, look at that.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.042
-GATUSSO: The biggest one
I've seen.
-JOE: Get a look at that.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.542
-What's it saying?
-JOE: Get a look at this.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.625
MATTY:
Oh, my goodness.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.542
MATTY:
Is that the biggest spike
you've seen?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.542
-JOE: Yeah, right now, yeah.
-MATTY: All right.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.292
-Then that's a prime candidate.
-GATUSSO: Yeah, let me scan it

17:19.375 --> 17:20.458
-one more time
just to make sure.
-Yeah, sure.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.000
-(GPR beeping)
-MATTY: About the size
of a chest, maybe, Marty?

17:24.167 --> 17:25.417
MARTY:
One can hope.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.542
GATUSSO:
I don't know if you can
see it in red right there.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.333
MATTY:
What is that red?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.917
-GATUSSO: Gold.
-MATTY: That's gold?

17:36.042 --> 17:37.250
It says gold with
an exclamation point.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.542
Well, I mean now we have to dig.

17:39.708 --> 17:44.250
MARTY:
So Mike's got some sort of
combination GPR/metal detector.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.208
The metal detection portion
of his instrument is saying

17:46.333 --> 17:48.167
that there's a certain

17:48.250 --> 17:52.167
likelihood percentage that
what he's detecting is gold.

17:52.292 --> 17:55.333
GATUSSO:
The depth is approximately
five to seven feet.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.375
-Okay.
-JOE: That's pretty deep.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.958
GATUSSO:
I mean, that's what it--

17:58.083 --> 17:59.750
I mean, it's five
to seven feet right here,

17:59.875 --> 18:01.250
right where I have this thing.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.875
And we can dig how much?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.083
AARON:
The regulations are,

18:05.208 --> 18:07.083
for every meter down,

18:07.208 --> 18:09.542
you have to go...
Uh, one down...

18:09.667 --> 18:11.792
So if you go down two,
you got to go out two.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.000
Okay, fair enough.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.333
Shall we begin?

18:14.458 --> 18:15.792
-MARTY: Yes.
-Let's break ground.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.125
Here we go, guys.
Captain?

18:18.250 --> 18:21.167
-JOE: Yes?
-It's official now, my friend.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.500
So, we know there's
about a foot of backfill.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.167
We'll do a two-meter
by two-meter

18:26.292 --> 18:27.667
and see what that anomaly is.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.250
MATTY:
This is a different type
of treasure hunt.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.500
There's a huge archaeological
component to this,

18:32.625 --> 18:34.333
and that's why
Dr. Aaron Taylor is here

18:34.458 --> 18:35.875
and that's why
we're able to do this.

18:36.042 --> 18:38.208
So we have to do this
very judiciously.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.167
I'm just gonna work this edge.

18:40.292 --> 18:41.917
...follow exactly what
Dr. Taylor tells us to do

18:42.042 --> 18:43.458
and how to do it.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.125
We're not just digging
a hole in the ground,

18:45.208 --> 18:46.167
frantically searching
for treasure here,

18:46.333 --> 18:47.500
or we'll get stopped.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.875
So we can see
a definite color change.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.292
-MATTY: Yeah.
-That we're getting rid of

18:53.375 --> 18:55.625
that white, gray backfill,

18:55.708 --> 18:59.375
and the orange is
probably the natural soil.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.292
MATTY:
Yeah, I see that color.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.042
So once we get
all the gray stuff out,

19:03.167 --> 19:05.208
then we'll start
sifting the orange stuff.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.292
MATTY:
Got it. Okay.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.875
Oh, can I get a root help?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.458
-ERIN: Yeah.
-MATTY: See that one?

19:10.542 --> 19:12.250
MARTY:
We knew we were
gonna run into roots,

19:12.375 --> 19:14.375
but we ran into a lot of roots.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.250
And the digging
is easy in the sense

19:16.375 --> 19:18.458
that it's sand,
but really difficult

19:18.583 --> 19:20.458
in the sense that
there are a lot of roots.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.000
AARON:
Let's give it a little scan.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.375
(GPR beeps intermittently)

19:25.917 --> 19:29.000
-(steady beeping)
-GATUSSO: It's still there.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.333
AARON:
All right,

19:30.458 --> 19:32.292
so let's start
filling the buckets.

19:33.208 --> 19:36.167
So in archaeology,
everything has to be screened

19:36.292 --> 19:39.542
and that way, we get all
the artifacts, large or small.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.792
GATUSSO:
Guys, you're gonna have to
lower that. This thing's heavy.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.333
AARON:
All right, ready?

19:45.417 --> 19:47.125
You shake all the dirt out

19:47.208 --> 19:49.500
and you're left with
usually a lot of roots,

19:49.667 --> 19:53.000
but in amongst the roots
you find the artifacts.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.500
Every artifact,

19:54.667 --> 19:57.458
no matter how big or small,
has a potential of

19:57.542 --> 19:59.708
telling a big historical story.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.708
-JOE: Let me go down in there.
-MATTY: Yes, sir.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.667
JOE:
Faint hit right there.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.333
-MATTY: All right, that's good.
-JOE: It's ringing.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.333
MATTY:
We're getting deeper right now.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.167
The work is hard.
It's hot.

20:15.292 --> 20:17.250
But we're still getting a hit.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.292
'Cause every time we check it,
we get another hit.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.833
So why would we stop now?

20:20.917 --> 20:22.000
I don't-I don't care
how deep this thing is.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.125
I'll dig all night.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.667
Want to switch, Mart?

20:27.208 --> 20:28.333
-JOE: Hey, Matty?
-MATTY: Yes, sir?

20:28.458 --> 20:30.667
Just for the hell of it,
try this auger.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.125
Try that.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.000
See if it works better
than the shovel.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.042
If not, we'll go back
to the shovel.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.750
You just keep twisting it.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.583
Good for that.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.292
Now, wait a minute.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.750
MATTY:
Ah...

20:46.875 --> 20:48.667
-ERIN: Yeah, we're in water.
-MARTY: Yep.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.833
-JOE: We definitely hit water.
-MATTY: Damn it.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.750
So we're digging,
trying to get that two feet,

20:52.875 --> 20:54.125
we know we're close

20:54.208 --> 20:55.875
and I hear this noise...
(imitates squelch)

20:56.000 --> 20:58.375
...and the hole is just
filling up with water.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.583
JOE:
Well, we definitely hit water.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
(quietly):
It's under there, Marty.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.417
AARON:
In archaeology,

21:05.542 --> 21:08.292
when you hit water,
you really have to stop.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.250
You can't excavate
through water.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.833
With every scoopful going down,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I could see the sand
getting wetter and wetter.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.708
GATUSSO:
Would you like me to rescan it

21:16.875 --> 21:18.792
-just to see where we're at?
-JOE: Yeah.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.625
And we're gonna put Michael
back in there for a scan.

21:21.750 --> 21:22.667
Okay.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.375
(beeping)

21:26.625 --> 21:28.833
-MATTY: You getting
that red circle again?
-GATUSSO: Yeah.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.542
MATTY:
That's good.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.583
We were still
getting the reading

21:32.708 --> 21:35.375
and then it becomes,
what do we do now?

21:36.375 --> 21:39.250
JOE:
I'm thinking,
this hole, in my opinion,

21:39.375 --> 21:41.000
it's that way.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.667
It's under that tree.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.167
We can go next to it,
but we can't go under.

21:45.292 --> 21:46.333
-(chuckles)
-ERIN: Yeah.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.417
JOE:
I would put even money

21:48.542 --> 21:50.125
that it's under
the bulb of that tree.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.833
Probably...

21:51.958 --> 21:54.083
another foot or so
better, better that way.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.125
Because you were, Mike,
you were getting

21:56.208 --> 21:57.333
a reading of another four feet?

21:57.458 --> 21:58.750
-Right.
-AARON: I don't know

21:58.875 --> 22:01.000
if we can get four feet
under this tree.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.417
-ERIN: No,
not without hurting it.
-No, we can't.

22:02.542 --> 22:03.833
I'll you tell you that.

22:03.958 --> 22:05.125
Not without that tree
being damaged or...

22:05.250 --> 22:06.958
falling down.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.250
You don't think
it's deeper here?

22:08.375 --> 22:09.833
No, I think it's that way.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.083
MARTY:
Okay, well,

22:13.208 --> 22:14.542
today something
new happened, right?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.708
You knew approximately
where the well was.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.542
-Now you know
exactly where it is.
-GATUSSO: Yeah, absolutely.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.958
MARTY: We got one more day,
and I guess I want to ask you,

22:21.042 --> 22:21.667
what do you think?

22:21.750 --> 22:22.917
Are we still in the right place?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.500
I-I feel that we are

22:24.667 --> 22:26.750
absolutely in the right place.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.583
Something probably
is down there,

22:29.708 --> 22:32.000
but it's just where
we can't get to it.

22:32.167 --> 22:35.500
And, obviously, this is
the first, the first hole.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.292
MARTY:
Yeah, and there's supposed
to be ten more of these

22:37.417 --> 22:38.375
-if it's here, right?
-Correct.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.708
We'll hit the best one tomorrow.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.250
MARTY:
You can't be
in this business without

22:44.375 --> 22:46.833
constantly having hope rise up

22:46.917 --> 22:48.667
and wanting for today
to be the day.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.375
Today is always the day
when you're treasure hunting.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.917
So, am I hopeful again?
Yeah.

22:54.042 --> 22:57.375
Nothing has been totally
disproven about the legend.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.708
There are at least
ten other places to look

22:59.875 --> 23:02.833
if the research
and the legend is true.

23:02.917 --> 23:07.000
So find me the next best spot
and we'll dig tomorrow.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.417
I can tell everyone's tired

23:08.542 --> 23:10.167
and a little hurt
and a little frustrated,

23:10.292 --> 23:11.417
but you haven't been wrong.

23:11.542 --> 23:12.833
Everything you have here
says there's gold,

23:12.917 --> 23:14.708
but it's just under
that dang tree.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.083
Let's just pick a favorite
tomorrow and let's do it again.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.792
JOE:
Being a foot away from

23:18.875 --> 23:22.875
a possible hundred-plus
million dollar find

23:23.000 --> 23:24.958
is just indescribable.

23:25.042 --> 23:29.792
You're so close, yet you might
as well be a hundred miles away.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.375
I could smell it,
I could taste it,

23:32.542 --> 23:34.500
but I can't touch it.

23:34.625 --> 23:37.167
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow is the day.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.667
Absolutely.
Tomorrow's the day.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.208
-MARTY: To your jobs, everybody.
-MATTY: Thanks, guys.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.875
MARTY:
We're still in the hunt, guys.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.833
-We're still in the hunt.
-ERIN: Absolutely.
It's not over.

23:47.708 --> 23:48.542
MARTY:
So, Matty Blake,

23:48.667 --> 23:50.542
what's the one word

23:50.667 --> 23:53.125
that drives success
in just about anything?

23:53.208 --> 23:56.208
Uh, one that comes to mind
right away is persistence.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.542
God, mine was perseverance.

23:57.667 --> 23:58.583
-Yeah.
-(laughs) All right.

23:58.708 --> 23:59.875
MARTY:
You know what?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
-That is awfully close.
-MATTY: Yes.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.667
We dug hard yesterday,

24:02.792 --> 24:04.542
and we hit a target
and couldn't get to it.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.500
-Mm-hmm.
-MATTY: So we still have
ten chances,

24:06.583 --> 24:07.917
and that excites me, you know?

24:08.042 --> 24:09.333
MARTY:
Absolutely.

24:09.458 --> 24:10.167
That's why there's
shovels in the back.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.375
(Matty chuckles)

24:11.542 --> 24:13.250
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins

24:13.375 --> 24:15.167
in Holiday, Florida,

24:15.250 --> 24:18.750
Matty Blake and Marty Lagina
arrive back at the site

24:18.875 --> 24:21.292
of the old Spanish Well
at Anclote River Park

24:21.375 --> 24:23.583
to join Joe Zsiga
and his team.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.917
-JOE: Good morning, guys.
-MATTY: Good morning, Captain.

24:26.042 --> 24:29.833
They are searching for
approximately $140 million

24:30.000 --> 24:33.083
in gold that the French
privateer Louis Aury

24:33.208 --> 24:34.958
and his Indigenous allies

24:35.083 --> 24:37.667
are believed to have
divided up and buried

24:37.792 --> 24:41.000
in 11 different treasure
caches two centuries ago.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.417
-GATUSSO: We got some
information for you.
-(chuckling): Good.

24:43.542 --> 24:45.292
So let me show you
what we came up with.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.708
NARRATOR:
Earlier this morning,
researcher Michael Gattuso

24:48.875 --> 24:51.333
conducted another
GPR survey of the area

24:51.458 --> 24:53.875
in order to identify
the most shallow

24:54.000 --> 24:56.583
and potentially
reachable targets.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.417
We rescanned these,
and if you can see,

24:59.542 --> 25:01.583
when we went around
the 18-foot circle,

25:01.708 --> 25:03.750
we actually had
strong possibilities.

25:03.875 --> 25:06.000
One there, one here, one there,
so within ten feet.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.792
But the only problem is
they're ten feet deep.

25:09.958 --> 25:10.667
All of them?

25:10.792 --> 25:11.917
Well, not all of them.

25:12.042 --> 25:13.750
We hit one
that's five to six feet.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.625
-MARTY: Here?
-Right here.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.000
MATTY:
Yeah, it fits right
in that perimeter

25:18.125 --> 25:20.792
we kind of created
based on your math, Marty.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.583
It's right on the line.

25:22.708 --> 25:25.000

ERIN:
Well, that-- logistically--
is a problem.

34:31.042 --> 34:32.792
Yes, it is.

34:32.917 --> 34:34.250
AARON:
So...

34:35.083 --> 34:37.167
...in archaeology,

34:37.250 --> 34:38.833
we have to stop
when we hit water.

34:38.917 --> 34:41.250
(groans)

34:41.375 --> 34:43.167
AARON:
I just, I don't see another--

34:43.250 --> 34:45.292
anything else
that we can really do.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.042
MATTY:
Well, you know what,
I mean, look,

34:47.208 --> 34:49.333
you did all the research,
you took your shot

34:49.500 --> 34:51.167
and we found some really
interesting items here.

34:51.292 --> 34:54.167
We did find some really
interesting artifacts.

34:54.250 --> 34:58.167
First Nations material culture,
stones, possibly tools.

34:58.292 --> 35:01.958
We found handmade
wrought iron nails,

35:02.083 --> 35:04.375
which are early.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.167
So, obviously, there was
contact between the Europeans,

35:07.292 --> 35:09.000
the Spanish
and the First Nations

35:09.125 --> 35:10.417
who were living here.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.958
Today we found, you know,
that contact period.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.042
-That's exciting.
-That is.
-Yeah.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.375
MARTY:
This was something
that was worth doing

35:18.500 --> 35:21.042
and it was worth doing right,
and we did do it right.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.792
What we found
were historical artifacts

35:23.875 --> 35:25.458
that are probably
going to advance the ball,

35:25.583 --> 35:27.417
the knowledge of
the history of Florida.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.167
I think it was,
in that sense, a success.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.167
You still believe
the treasure is here?

35:32.333 --> 35:33.167
-Yes, I do.
-You do?

35:33.250 --> 35:35.375
JOE:
Yes, I do.

35:35.542 --> 35:37.458

out there that points to it.

35:37.542 --> 35:39.458
-Yeah.
-MARTY: Well, we know

35:39.583 --> 35:41.542
-how hard it is
to retrieve. (laughs)
-MATTY: Yeah.

35:41.708 --> 35:44.750
If we were allowed to have
a small backhoe in there,

35:44.875 --> 35:47.750
we would've got to that cache.

35:47.875 --> 35:51.042
I don't think this is
the end of Captain Joe Zsiga.

35:51.167 --> 35:52.875

that you didn't give up
