WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:07.507
Storm is stepping in as
the provisional bosun.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.259
What I'm gonna do is show
Sandy, you know,

00:09.300 --> 00:10.468
that she made the right
decision.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.803
Here we go.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.722
Starboard quarter
[garbled radio chatter] stern.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.015
I don't hear Storm.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.183
Kick forward.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.768
Press your mic and then talk.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.520
Ugh, we're gonna hit.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.313
Ugh.

00:22.355 --> 00:25.150
-Did we damage the vessel?
-No.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.860
Storm is still provisional.

00:26.901 --> 00:30.363
I need to make sure he can do
the job and run the deck team.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.615
Just relax and breathe.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.701
How's been your
two days of vacation?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.163
This morning, you've
only just gotten up.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.914
I've set the table.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.166
-I'm helping you turn over.
-Because I don't want you...

00:41.207 --> 00:42.542
and I appreciate that so much,

00:42.584 --> 00:43.710
but I don't want you
to do extra work.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.670
Well, clearly ----ing not.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Kyle, this is
literally going nowhere.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.256
I'm actually getting pissed off.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.216
It's got a boner.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.843
I'm so stoked
to have Courtney back.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.261
She brings a lot of flair.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.180
-Just the tip, though.
-Just the tip.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.349
No, not finding it funny?
Okay.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.309
-No, I'm just, like...
-Tough crowd.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.394
I'm not in sync with
these guys, for sure.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.356
I'm strategizing
how I can fit in.

01:04.397 --> 01:08.568
So, you're the diangle...
uh, diagonal diamond man.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.740
I'm stoked to see
where this goes, cheers.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.450
Oh, my God, okay.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.660
Obviously, I'm very stoked to
be spending more time with her.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.621
My deck crew and I have
heaps to do tomorrow.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.289
Like, we haven't
done the corridors,

01:21.331 --> 01:22.582
we haven't done the aft.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.376
Keep the work chat
in the workplace.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.836
Let's dance, let's have,
like, a few drinks.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.547
Mate, mate [inaudible]...

01:29.589 --> 01:33.385
You need to snap out of the
little emotional pity party.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.599
On our last boat, me and
Tash, we got together.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.434
She was
still with her boyfriend,

01:41.476 --> 01:43.645
but she wanted to be with me.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.234
And this whole Dave situation

01:49.275 --> 01:51.861
made me realize
I still love my ex.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.158
You don't know what you want.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.535
What the [bleep] are you doing?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.371
She literally just got
back with her boyfriend.

02:37.032 --> 02:37.991
Good morning.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.534
Good morning, sunshine.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.578
-How are you?
-Christ, I'm hungover.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.924
How are you?

02:54.966 --> 02:55.925
Have a seat for a second?

02:55.967 --> 02:57.135
Of course.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.970
Okay, hand towels,
face towels...

02:59.012 --> 03:00.972
Last night was fun, but then,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.183
like, I just don't
like getting in, like...

03:03.224 --> 03:04.684
I think you were a little,
like, emotional,

03:04.726 --> 03:07.270
and I was, like, oh, I gotta go,
I gotta go dance.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.855
Yeah, fair enough.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.231
Like, I just can't do
seriousness when I'm out.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.524
Yeah.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.859
But I was like, I'm
just not vibing,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.486
but I didn't mean,
like, me and you.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.695
I was like,
I'm not vibing the situation

03:15.737 --> 03:16.863
of take a shot and
dance, like...

03:16.905 --> 03:17.947
Of course, yeah.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.282
Yeah, but also, that's just me.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.784
No, it was...
it's the same for me,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.036
but I think I was just
really tired, and I just...

03:23.078 --> 03:24.204
it got the better of me.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.706
Storm was a bit
tragic last night,

03:26.748 --> 03:28.958
but I get over things
really quickly.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.919
We're learning each other
at the moment.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.379
We're learning what we
like about each other.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.506
But, you know,
I still like the guy.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.675
He's very caring,
he's very considerate,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.219
so still wanna
see where this goes.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.346
New day, new start.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.931
I'm sorry.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.516
I was actually worried
for a second.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.101
Dave, Natasha, and Storm,

03:46.142 --> 03:48.561
meet me in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.938
Copy.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.153
Morning, Dave.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.488
Thanks.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.656
Thank you very much.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.241
Okay, charter number four.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.743
Adam Spinner is a brilliant, New
York-based technology executive.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.912
Joining Adam is
his sister, Jennifer.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.956
Everyone is looking forward
to celebrating

04:07.997 --> 04:10.083
an unforgettable thirtieth
birthday for Adam.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.584
Yeah.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.294
They would like to play with
all of the water toys,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.255
-especially the slide.
-Yeah.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.257
It should arrive with the
rest of the provisions today.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.758
All right.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.927
Adam also requests for a
water obstacle course

04:20.969 --> 04:23.096
to be set up for
a friendly competition.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.556
Yeah.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.308
You can use the slide,
the pool, the trampoline.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.601
Cool.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.020
Dinner around the world,

04:30.061 --> 04:32.397
with each course from a
different country.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.107
This is gonna be a fun charter.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.944
Yeah.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.029
All right, so, great.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.488
All right, I'm outta here.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.869
Let's get this ----ing
charter ready, steady, go.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.537
We're gonna have to do
a full rinse-down.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.331
I've got charter guests
coming in three hours.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.624
So, we really need
to move quickly.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.501
-Cool.
-Yeah, okay.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.802
These pillows look like
Casper's balls...

05:02.844 --> 05:06.264
just saggy.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.766
You're obsessed with balls.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.899
-Heya.
-Hey.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.442
You okay?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.488
Last night, you couldn't
look at me.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.948
You couldn't even look at me.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.825
We couldn't...
it felt so awkward.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.745
It's not like I was...
I've been ignoring you.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.499
I've just been struggling
to deal with

05:32.540 --> 05:33.917
the whole situation in my head,

05:33.958 --> 05:36.836
and comprehend everything
that's happened.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.005
It's all right,
it wont happen anymore.

05:39.047 --> 05:44.511
And...
You're on your own now, girl.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.472
I'll do my job, you do your job.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.849
Okay, but our job
requires working together.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.352
I've tried that,
it's not working.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.603
You've been awful to me,

05:53.645 --> 05:55.355
and I'm sick of
pussyfooting around you.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.690
I'm ----ing done with it.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.692
I'm sick of dwelling
on this anymore,

05:58.733 --> 06:00.694
because I'm miserable for...

06:00.735 --> 06:02.278
I deserve way better
than you anyway, so.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.197
We had our thing,

06:04.239 --> 06:08.535
and so it's done, it's over.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.704
But we've still gotta
work together, Dave.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.331
Luckily, I just need
to do the food.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.418
Put out good food, and then
you can do all the rest.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.587
Well, that's not
a professional way to work.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.256
I'm very professional at my job.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.216
I'm not gonna let someone
[bleep] it up, though, right?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.719
I'm not ----ing up your job,
I'm just trying to talk to you.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.221
I thought we'd done talking.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.349
I can't be dealing with this
stubbornness, it's just not...

06:31.391 --> 06:33.560
-What stubbornness?
-It's not...

06:33.601 --> 06:34.561
I'm just writing the...

06:34.602 --> 06:36.021
It's not the negativity,

06:36.062 --> 06:37.230
and it's not the energy
that I need right now.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.482
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.658
Did I interrupt you guys',
like, serious conversation?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.326
Should I leave the room?

06:50.368 --> 06:51.911
No, it's good.
Perfect timing.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.455
No, it's okay, I'm actually
trying to speak

06:53.496 --> 06:54.748
to Dave about work,
but he doesn't...

06:54.789 --> 06:55.790
Because you got silent.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.417
He doesn't want to speak,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.586
and I'm just trying to
sort things out,

06:59.627 --> 07:02.088
because I feel like Dave
doesn't want to...

07:02.130 --> 07:05.050
He said he'd figure it out, and
he doesn't need to speak to...

07:05.091 --> 07:08.136
If it's got anything to do
with the job, we'll communicate.

07:11.514 --> 07:15.226
Clearly there's some
tension here,

07:15.268 --> 07:18.480
so I think, obviously,

07:18.521 --> 07:19.773
if she has to talk to you
about the menu,

07:19.814 --> 07:20.774
you'll talk to her, right?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.108
-Obviously.
-Okay.

07:22.150 --> 07:26.321
I just think your
service is impeccable.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.449
You know, your food is beyond.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.451
Just be patient with each other,

07:31.493 --> 07:33.620
keep your main focus on the job,

07:33.661 --> 07:35.830
and just work
as professionals.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.457
You think you can do this?

07:37.499 --> 07:38.500
Yeah.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.709
-You, too?
-Yes, boss.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.461
Great, thank you.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.547
It isn't the first time I've had
a boatmance that went wrong.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.257
I always want my crew to
feel supported,

07:46.299 --> 07:49.719
but at the same time give them
the space to sort this out,

07:49.761 --> 07:51.388
because I can't
solve it for you.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.182
But I also want them to
know I have an expectation.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.643
Even though
relationships happen,

07:56.685 --> 07:58.812
they hook up,
they have arguments,

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
when they step up those stairs,

08:00.772 --> 08:03.817
I need to know they're
gonna remain professional.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.488
Coming up...

08:08.530 --> 08:09.989
Are you nervous?

08:10.031 --> 08:12.659
-Well, I don't know.
-I am, don't worry.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.997
Do not ever get
intimate with guests.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.916
I could possibly lose my job.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.133
Stand by, we have to put
this back in the water.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.051
It needs to be fueled
tomorrow morning.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.970
I bet this is gonna be gross.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.972
What life is this, honestly.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.058
Just watch your step when
you get off of the boat.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.768
Okay.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.145
There you go, nicely done.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.688
Should I turn around,
but keep her in neutral?

08:41.730 --> 08:42.731
Uh...

08:42.772 --> 08:43.732
When I take the hook off, or...

08:43.773 --> 08:44.816
Only when you take the hook off.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.443
-Yeah.
-You got it, girl.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.695
It's always nerve-wracking,
driving the tenders,

08:48.737 --> 08:50.405
because obviously, things can
go really wrong

08:50.447 --> 08:53.700
when you're doing it, and it's,
like, actually, like, dangerous.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.035
Okay, kick her on.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.579
Nice.
We'll meet you at the stern.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.580
-Yeah.
-We'll tie you up.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.664
Good job.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.166
I mean, hopefully I'll get it,

09:01.207 --> 09:03.418
but so far, I'm not
friends with this tender.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.794
It's like a button...

09:04.836 --> 09:06.588
like, you have to press
a button go to forward

09:06.629 --> 09:07.922
or press a button
to go back.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.758
Ooh, she's gonna dock it?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.384
Courts, remember,
when the bow's up,

09:11.426 --> 09:14.637
put it in reverse and turn
it the other way around,

09:14.679 --> 09:16.139
-you got it.
-Yeah.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.767
Just ----ing put a throttle
on there or something.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.727
Driving this tender
is literally, like,

09:20.769 --> 09:22.395
that thing people always
used to do where you,

09:22.437 --> 09:24.439
like, pat your head but,
like, rub your stomach,

09:24.481 --> 09:26.316
whatever the [bleep] it is.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.776
Who even invented this?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.904
Like, it's the most
pointless thing ever.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.239
That was awesome!

09:33.281 --> 09:34.115
She did a good job.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.617
You know, it's really cool,

09:35.658 --> 09:37.494
it looks like the deckhands
finally got a groove.

09:37.535 --> 09:41.206
Having Courtney on deck is
definitely a big part of this.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.541
So, yeah, I'm pleased
with the deck crew.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.959
They have a rhythm.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.961
She's crushing it.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.547
I'm so excited to see who's
the new charter guests.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.633
Ooh!

09:51.675 --> 09:55.136
Oh, my God, these people
are so hot.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.809
This charter definitely
will test me.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.268
You test the water.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.231
It could be a shark-infested
water, or it can...

10:06.272 --> 10:08.608
not be, you know.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.694
Oh, my God, can I keep
Frank's sheet in my room?

10:10.735 --> 10:11.986
I'll make sure he gets

10:12.028 --> 10:14.114
everything he
needs, specifically.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.323
Normally, he calls me "steward,"

10:15.365 --> 10:17.409
but tonight,
he can call me "daddy."

10:17.450 --> 10:20.912
Yeah!

10:20.954 --> 10:24.332
All crew, all crew,
we have provisions.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.751
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>the slide is on its way.</i>

10:28.211 --> 10:29.671
Do we have a wine delivery?

10:29.713 --> 10:31.131
They're all on board already.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.340
They've brought it on,
I just need to sign?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.383
Yes.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.682
Okay, perfect.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.476
I feel like a wine pairing
is something

10:43.518 --> 10:46.521
that you don't get every day
in your standard restaurant.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.400
It's what takes your service
level from here to here.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.444
Thank you so much.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.572
This granite looks awful.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.782
Day head done.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.617
[bleep] me.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.327
I don't know where
to put it all.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.000
Jesus Christ.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.677
-Nat?
-Yeah?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.137
What the [bleep] are you doing?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.138
Excuse me?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.390
Honestly, like,
we need your help

11:22.432 --> 11:23.975
and you're just busy
----ing folding rags.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.352
I'm literally going
to knock you out.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.603
If people do not get
their crew uniform...

11:26.644 --> 11:27.896
Literally...

11:27.937 --> 11:29.814
...back, then what
are they going to wear?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.399
What are they gonna wear
when they see guests?

11:31.441 --> 11:32.275
You have rags here, yeah.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.069
The laundry needs to keep going.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.403
Just because you guys don't know
how to approach the laundry

11:35.445 --> 11:36.946
and get it going for
the next charter...

11:36.988 --> 11:38.573
Honestly, maybe you
should be more on point.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.657
Then we don't have this problem.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.076
Oh, I'm gonna knock you out.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.660
If people don't have
uniforms to pick up,

11:42.702 --> 11:45.789
Captain Sandy will
be very angry.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.041
Do you, you boot,
and I'll do me.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.836
Is this my slide?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.922
<i>Jason, Jason, for Storm.</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:55.423
<i>Lend me a hand</i>
<i>on the dock, please.</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:57.217
Copy, on my way.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.887
All crew, all crew, guest
arrival in 30 minutes.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.431
What's up?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.683
Is it all one piece?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.267
Yes, that's the slide.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.103
Are we gonna be able to move
that tender over here?

12:08.144 --> 12:10.355
No, you can't drop it like that,
it'll break the tender.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.565
This is 500 pounds.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.196
Yeah.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.907
We've got half an hour
until guests arrive.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.075
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.327
Oh, my God, this is a disaster.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.798
I am 100 percent green
in the mega-yachting world,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.633
but I'm not 100 green.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.802
I actually do have experience

12:40.844 --> 12:43.930
in not only boating
but also sailing.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.765
The challenge I'm having
is knowing when

12:45.807 --> 12:51.855
my input is welcome, or if
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.523
Right, that's why
we tie two lines on it,

12:53.565 --> 12:57.569
and then tie it off the side,
on the rail.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.987
I know it's not gonna be flush,

12:59.029 --> 13:02.115
but it's a bumper,
meant to be bumped.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.119
Okay.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.412
Courtney, Courtney, Storm.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.330
Can you come down
to the dock, please?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.875
Dave, Dave, Storm,
come to the dock

13:11.916 --> 13:13.668
just help me out here.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.086
Copy that, bro, on my way.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.129
Where do you want me?

13:16.171 --> 13:19.049
You need to help with the ropes.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.633
I need to make space
to put that on.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.093
I can't put it there.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.470
-Hold the ropes, yeah?
-You're gonna tip it up?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.929
You're gonna have to hold
that weight, eh?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.222
-Yeah.
-You tilting it in?

13:26.264 --> 13:29.726
-Yeah.
-At the same time, ready?

13:29.768 --> 13:30.727
Oh, yeah, it's good.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.313
All right, gonna let go now.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.399
-Yeah.
-Yeah, got it.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.609
-Watch your feet, guys.
-Got it.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.860
You got it?

13:38.902 --> 13:39.903
All right, now we can
push it up.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.697
Yeah, it's 500 pounds.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.948
-That's it.
-All right.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.533
Can't Courtney drive the tender?

13:45.575 --> 13:47.452
-Yeah, I can, do you want me to?
-Yep.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.791
-Okay, Court.
-Yeah?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.042
-You can clutch in now.
-Yeah?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.294
And drive out very slowly, yeah?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.880
I'll meet you at the crane.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.507
Remember, you can always
put it in neutral

14:00.548 --> 14:01.925
and push yourself off
of a boat.

14:01.966 --> 14:02.926
-Okay.
-Okay?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.469
Thank you.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.262
You'll see a loop
that's hanging over.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.681
That's what you gotta
clip into the crane.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.682
-Okay.
-Okay?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.100
Yeah.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.686
So, Court, watch your stern
against the hull.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.021
Okay, she's in.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.065
She's got this.
Good job.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.441
Well done.

14:21.778 --> 14:26.908
Courtney is 100 percent a better
tender driver than I am,

14:26.950 --> 14:28.660
and it's good to see
her in her groove.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.872
But I'm always impressed
with Courtney, to be honest.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.541
Well done, Court.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.585
All right, I'm gonna go get
changed and do a walkaround.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.671
I'm gonna get ready
for these boys.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.394
I've got the best plan
for us this whole trip.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.687
Go on.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.980
Oh, yeah?

14:57.022 --> 14:59.274
Okay, everybody,
let's go to the dock.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.154
Yeah, I like it.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.949
Guys, I think this is them.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.327
Look, there it is, over there.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.413
Oh, look, it's so pretty.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.081
-I hope we have a gay boy.
-I hope so too.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.458
I hope they're really hot, too,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.251
because if they're
really hot, then...

15:18.293 --> 15:20.170
-I would love to...
-That would be so nice to do.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.882
Oh, I can see him already.
Oh, my God, Tash.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.551
[wolf whistle]

15:27.844 --> 15:32.474
-Oh, my God!
-Feel me?

15:32.515 --> 15:33.683
Hi!

15:33.725 --> 15:35.977
Hi, it's so nice
to meet you, I'm Adam.

15:36.019 --> 15:36.978
Adam, welcome.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.813
Hi, David, so nice to meet you.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.482
Adam, I'm Natasha.

15:40.523 --> 15:45.320
Hi, nice to meet you,
I'm Kyle.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.074
I see this tall man,
beautiful smile.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.075
Hey.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.451
-Frank...
-Kyle.

15:51.493 --> 15:55.663
And I'm thinking,
holy hell, Lord save me.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.002
Coming up...

16:01.044 --> 16:03.004
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper...

16:03.046 --> 16:04.756
This is a ----ing
proper bowline.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.760
Don't ever do that, ever.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.350
Welcome to your Home
away from home.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.559
How appropriate is that?

16:16.601 --> 16:17.852
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you so much.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.604
So, Natasha's our chief stew.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.356
She's gonna show you around,
and then we'll be on our way.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.399
You getting nervous?
Who's the love of your life?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.067
I'm vibing with the blue shirt.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.069
-Deep blue shirt?
-Yeah.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.195
Yeah, he's cute.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.530
We've got piña coladas here.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.699
There's some nice mulberry
smoothies.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.534
Do we get to keep the
pineapples?

16:32.575 --> 16:33.743
This is so cool.

16:33.785 --> 16:34.911
Yep.

16:34.953 --> 16:35.912
Oh, my God, this is so cute.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.372
Where's our luggage cart?

16:37.414 --> 16:38.998
I think it's still to come.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.042
Wait, is that not one of them?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.211
Storm?

16:44.462 --> 16:47.173
That's not in my vocabulary,
unfortunately.

16:47.215 --> 16:51.136
Sometimes it needs to be.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.430
So, we're actually gonna start
the tour walking this way.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.473
If you want,
take your drinks with.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.603
We have a spinning table,

17:00.645 --> 17:03.106
so it's perfect
for buffet-style meals.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.107
What about dancing?

17:04.149 --> 17:06.109
Most... yes!

17:06.151 --> 17:07.444
This is the sundeck.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.279
I can tell you guys
like to party a bit.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.280
A little bit.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.448
What gave it away?

17:11.489 --> 17:12.615
-That all the luggage?
-Yeah.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.450
Yep.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.951
Yeah this is the white one.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.411
You know, I'm actually so
glad to finally have,

17:16.453 --> 17:19.330
like, a straight group
of friends.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.331
It's gonna go crazy.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.791
Oh, you have no idea.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.502
There's gonna be penis
and penis and penis.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.422
I'm like, holy sh--,
it's Heaven.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.174
-We're gonna have a great time.
-Hear, hear.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.300
-Yeah!
-Cheers to the queers.

17:30.342 --> 17:34.429
-Woo!
-Cheers to the queers!

17:34.471 --> 17:35.722
Doesn't look bad at all.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.642
I don't see any bumps
on the horizon.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.479
All crew, all crew,
passerelle is coming in.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.730
Okay, Jay, you're gonna
be on the bow, yeah?

17:43.772 --> 17:45.148
Okay.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.483
Mzi, you can help him,
and then as soon as it's in,

17:46.524 --> 17:47.484
you come to the stern, yeah?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.902
-Court...
-Yeah.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.612
You're gonna be with me
and Mzi on the stern.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.822
I am definitely nervous for
all docking operations

17:52.864 --> 17:55.950
at this point, because
last time, we hit the dolphin.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.994
Kick forward.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.037
We're gonna hit.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.664
I ----ing hate dolphins.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.333
Not the real ones,
I love real dolphins.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.126
These dolphins can...

18:05.168 --> 18:07.128
Okay, we can free
up all bowlines,

18:07.170 --> 18:08.463
we can free up the stern lines.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.257
Copy that, stern
lines releasing now.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.843
-Okay, release this one, yeah?
-Yeah.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.053
Are all lines in?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.971
All bow lines are on deck.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.724
All lines on the stern are in.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.725
Yeah.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.977
Cool.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.354
<i>Let me know when</i>
<i>I'm free to swing.</i>

18:24.396 --> 18:27.023
Copy that, Cap.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.359
There's a dolphin,
six meters, port quarter,

18:29.401 --> 18:30.860
six meters, port quarter.

18:30.902 --> 18:35.532
<i>Dolphin port midship,</i>
<i>two meters, two meters.</i>

18:35.573 --> 18:39.703
<i>Port dolphin one meter,</i>
<i>on your quarter.</i>

18:39.744 --> 18:43.039
<i>Port dolphin one meter,</i>
<i>on your quarter.</i>

18:43.081 --> 18:45.917
Oh, nice!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.712
Stern is clear, stern is clear,
you're free to swing.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.380
All right, guys, I can see.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.298
<i>Thank you very much, you did</i>
<i>a good job, excellent job.</i>

18:52.340 --> 18:55.593
Copy that, Captain.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.803
Do we get to see that, or no?

18:56.845 --> 18:57.971
You can.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.097
Oh, yes, yes!

18:59.139 --> 19:00.098
-Ooh!
-Is that the kitchen?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.099
-Yeah.
-Can we see it?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.308
-Can we look?
-Yeah.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.309
-Are we allowed to see it?
-Yes.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.477
So, that's Chef Dave.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.687
-How you doing?
-How tall are you?

19:05.729 --> 19:06.855
I'm 6'3".

19:06.896 --> 19:08.732
All right, Frank,
it's not a competition.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.984
Oh, my gosh.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.610
Whew.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.404
Deck team, deck team, once
you're finished with the lines,

19:14.446 --> 19:15.822
please go down and
change into your reds.

19:15.864 --> 19:16.906
Copy that.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.241
I'm so excited for food,
by the way.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.077
Me too, I'm really hungry.

19:21.119 --> 19:25.206
Oh!

19:25.248 --> 19:27.042
Damn, Kyle, fix yourself up.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.460
As soon as they go to lunch,

19:28.501 --> 19:29.961
that's when we'll
throw the slide in.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.963
Well, we also just need
to [bleep] figure out

19:32.005 --> 19:32.964
how that thing works.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.466
Welcome back to the party.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.926
Terrible, ugly people.
The worst.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.471
Oh, my God, how cute!

19:48.355 --> 19:50.065
No, that's Mike's.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.149
I only have one drink.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.692
Maybe he's nervous.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.069
Frank, are you nervous,
is that why you're drinking?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.570
Frank... Frank, are you nervous?

19:55.612 --> 19:58.490
-Well, I don't know.
-I am, don't worry.

20:03.161 --> 20:06.539
I saw you coming down,
and I'm like, wow.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.375
-I...
-That smile is everything.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.626
Wow, thank you.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.086
Like, anything
else can disappear,

20:11.127 --> 20:12.253
but the smile is golden.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.130
-You like that?
-For real.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.633
I'm genuine.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.593
Beliefs be damned,
but there is a God.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.721
The body...
Lord, have mercy.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.683
Areolas the size
of earthquake holes.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.975
I never knew I had
a nipple fantasy

20:26.017 --> 20:29.354
until I met
"pancake nipple" Frank.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.733
Shut up!

20:33.775 --> 20:35.068
Oh, my God,
tell me now.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.862
No, tell me now, it can't wait.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.532
He came down, and the first
person I saw was him, so I said,

20:40.573 --> 20:42.575
I'm gonna be honest,
when you came down,

20:42.617 --> 20:43.660
your smile was the most golden.

20:43.702 --> 20:44.661
-He was like...
-Did he?

20:44.703 --> 20:46.162
This means a lot.

20:46.204 --> 20:49.749
I'm gonna let Kyle continue
to flirt with Frank,

20:49.791 --> 20:54.212
but he cannot go any
further than flirting.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.922
So, they need to be careful,

20:55.964 --> 20:57.674
because if the
captain finds out,

20:57.716 --> 21:00.385
he could lose his job over this.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.390
Coming up...

21:05.432 --> 21:06.349
We need a secondary line.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.350
Jason!

21:07.392 --> 21:09.436
Jason!
[whistles]

21:09.477 --> 21:12.480
Jason!

21:12.522 --> 21:14.816
He's flat-out ignoring me.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.864
So, I'm gonna let you
guys do the anchor.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.199
Court, you can take the remote.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.492
[bleep] me.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.454
-Yeah, yeah, no, it's okay.
-Opa!

21:27.495 --> 21:29.456
-Only to the waterline.
-Yeah.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.749
<i>Captain Sandy, Captain Sandy,</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:32.042
we are ready to
drop anchor when you are.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.668
We'll go to three
shackles first,

21:33.710 --> 21:36.171
and then we'll let
the other shackle out.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.180
I mean, three shackles
in the water, sorry.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.639
Okay, that's good.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.933
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hello.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.310
Where are you from, originally?

21:50.352 --> 21:51.436
Take a guess.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.356
-London.
-Interesting.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.150
I'm from South Africa.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.943
I can see you staring at
my lips the entire time,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.445
have I got something
on my lips?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.405
No, no, no,
you're totally fine.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.199
-Totally fine.
-Totally fine.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.367
I'm fine, fine.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.868
You do have very
white teeth, too.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.119
So do you!

22:08.161 --> 22:10.538
I was looking at that,
I'm like, okay, vampire.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.040
I'm in the mood.

22:12.082 --> 22:15.293
-I'll be right back.
-All righty.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.461
Oh!

22:16.503 --> 22:18.213
We are a professional team.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.631
We have our limitations.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.299
And one of those big limitations

22:21.341 --> 22:23.551
is do not ever
get intimate with guests.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.178
I could possibly lose my job.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.308
By argue you mean you could
argue I'm being unprofessional,

22:30.350 --> 22:33.561
and I would agree.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.231
Lord, have mercy on my soul.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.358
Do you want me to get in my
wets for the jetskis?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.693
-Yes, please, thank you.
-Yeah.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.321
-Woo!
-Ooh!

22:43.363 --> 22:44.322
-All right!
-Yes!

22:44.364 --> 22:45.865
Who is that?

22:45.907 --> 22:47.992
That is the fanciest Red Bull
I have ever received.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.078
Oh, I only put it on ice
because it's ----ing hot.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.204
Thank you.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.003
When would you like me
to start running?

22:58.044 --> 22:59.963
Do you reckon five minutes?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.632
Less than that.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.800
Okay, then I'll take
the cold stuff now.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.010
Yeah, I'm not far behind.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.386
Okay, perfect.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.513
This is the hardest charter
season I've ever done,

23:08.555 --> 23:11.975
because of this
situation with Natasha.

23:12.017 --> 23:15.895
We weren't dating, but it
does feel like a break-up.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.355
I feel a bit silly saying it,

23:17.397 --> 23:20.567
but it's like a little
torture on a stick,

23:20.608 --> 23:21.943
seeing her every day.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.653
She's back with
her boyfriend now,

23:23.695 --> 23:26.865
and until she
absolutely despises me,

23:26.906 --> 23:32.620
as she almost did, I guess
I'm just gonna hang in there.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.957
Oh, my God, that looks dreamy.

23:35.999 --> 23:40.378
We're gonna start
on the slide now.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.505
Wow, look at this.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.715
Wow!

23:43.757 --> 23:45.216
What a beautiful color.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.719
It is.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.262
I don't know what you
guys think,

23:49.304 --> 23:51.139
but I reckon let's ----ing
throw this bitch over.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.557
Is that what you guys
did last time?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.225
You just throw it over.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.977
-Yeah, we just threw it.
-Yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.229
Thing is, with the slide,
given previous experiences,

23:58.271 --> 24:01.816
I just remember the slide
was horrible to deal with.

24:01.858 --> 24:06.237
Release the beast.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.947
Why is this not hard?

24:07.989 --> 24:10.617
And now that it's four
new people

24:10.658 --> 24:12.911
who have never done this
before on a boat

24:12.952 --> 24:16.206
that's never had a slide on it
before, it's a bit daunting.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.041
Just hoist it over.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.086
What kind of beef is that?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.672
Filet.

24:23.713 --> 24:24.756
Oh, there's more tacos.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.675
There's loads more coming up.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.636
Like, this is really amazing.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.810
Long-distance relationships

24:36.851 --> 24:39.145
in yachting almost
seems impossible.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.314
It's not like you can
stand there,

24:41.356 --> 24:44.984
writing out this 10-page essay.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.737
I'm not gonna lie,
it's very distracting.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.948
Wow, that was delicious.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.199
I mean, this guy is legit.

24:51.241 --> 24:52.617
-Are you complaining?
-No.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.868
-Still or sparkling?
-Still, please.

24:53.910 --> 24:54.994
-Still?
-Yes.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.788
-Yeah?
-That's fine, yes.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.627
Now you're gonna tie a bowline
to these jet-ski cleats,

25:02.669 --> 25:05.463
just so we have the safety,
and then try and pump it up.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.090
All right.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.675
I want people to understand that
I know what I'm doing,

25:08.717 --> 25:10.677
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.930
All the other vessels that
I worked on have been

25:13.972 --> 25:16.933
expedition vessels, small
sailing and charter vessels.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.643
So, I'm thinking to myself,
all right, well,

25:18.685 --> 25:20.437
just fake it till
you make it, baby.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.813
You gonna jump in the water,

25:21.855 --> 25:23.148
you're gonna unclip it
from the crane...

25:23.189 --> 25:24.274
Yeah.

25:24.315 --> 25:29.487
And you're gonna take
that line out.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.698
So, Adam, I need to fill
you in on the plans.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.658
Frank and Kyle
are gonna be boyfriends,

25:33.700 --> 25:34.993
and I'm gonna marry them.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.411
-Ooh, I like that.
-I need a boyfriend.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.495
Yeah, exactly.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.289
I've been here the whole time.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.707
What the hell?

25:40.749 --> 25:42.250
There we go.

25:47.797 --> 25:53.636
Here's your line...
get that on quickly.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.722
Did a good job, Mzi!

25:57.724 --> 26:00.352
Yeah, we need to move it back
so I can untie the bowline.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.813
I'll hold that line while
you do this, because... yeah.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.568
Got it?

26:08.610 --> 26:09.736
What did you tie it?

26:09.778 --> 26:12.030
It's a bowline.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.616
This is not a bowline, dude.

26:14.657 --> 26:15.867
Yeah, it is, buddy.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.327
Okay, well, then, get it off
there.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.536
I need slack, that's what
I was trying to do

26:18.578 --> 26:22.040
for the past few minutes.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.833
Yeah, well, I need
more slack, then.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.418
Because that's how
a bowline works.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.712
I can't stand
this arguing, dude.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.631
Look, dude.
I tied it.

26:29.673 --> 26:30.965
I know it's a bowline.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.842
If I'm now explaining
knots to you,

26:32.884 --> 26:35.053
then I don't know
what else to do, man.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.097
You look like an idiot.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.765
-Can you do it?
-Trying.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.685
Just next time, just make sure
that you get the right knot.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.895
We both said to do bowlines,
and I did a ----ing bowline.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.230
I said...

26:45.271 --> 26:46.856
You put more pressure,
it gets stronger.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.441
That's how it works,
learn your knots.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.110
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper bowline.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.111
This is a ----ing
proper bowline.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.404
Bowline release under pressure,

26:52.445 --> 26:54.072
that's the whole
point of the knot.

27:03.581 --> 27:05.333
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper bowline.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.710
This is a ----ing
proper bowline.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.128
Bowline release under pressure,

27:08.169 --> 27:10.547
that's the whole point
of the knot.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.676
This has to be moved
off the life raft.

27:14.718 --> 27:17.762
I need to somehow pull the slide
across to relieve the pressure,

27:17.804 --> 27:18.888
because it's all
sitting on this point.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.348
You can't just cut that end?

27:20.390 --> 27:23.018
I can cut this end.
We'll lose six inches.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.561
That's fine.

27:24.602 --> 27:27.397
Just around itself.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.733
And back down on itself.

27:29.774 --> 27:34.362
This way, you allow yourself
to get rid easily, right?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.865
You can cut.

27:36.906 --> 27:40.118
I don't know what the [bleep] he
tied, but it was not a bowline.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.871
And then the fact that
he swore at me...

27:42.912 --> 27:44.914
don't ever do that, ever.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.833
Okay, you're good.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.626
Yeah.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.628
So, we just went back
to Iceland last week, though,

27:50.670 --> 27:53.006
and apparently now it's
entirely gay and vegan.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.174
Super gay and vegan!

27:54.215 --> 27:55.675
Yeah, because every gay
that I know

27:55.717 --> 27:57.177
has been to Iceland
in the past two years.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.553
Except then we ordered
mozzarella sticks,

27:58.595 --> 28:00.180
and they gave us
mozzarella sticks and ketchup.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.556
No, but I feel like think
people think

28:01.598 --> 28:05.393
ketchup and marinara sauce
are the same.

28:05.435 --> 28:09.731
Okay, Mzi, you're gonna
go for a ride, brü.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.733
Woo!

28:11.775 --> 28:12.942
Good job, Mzi!

28:12.984 --> 28:14.110
You guys did it.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.695
If this was lunch,

28:15.737 --> 28:17.530
I don't even know what dinner
is gonna look like.

28:17.572 --> 28:20.200
All the people were setting up
the water things downstairs.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.201
Oh, are we ready for water?

28:21.242 --> 28:22.202
It's all set, yeah.

28:22.243 --> 28:23.411
Let's go check it out.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.000
What did he say?

28:29.042 --> 28:30.585
I saw he was giving lip.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.264
-I mean Jason, not Storm.
-No, I know.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.058
Like, how old are you now?

28:45.100 --> 28:46.768
-I'm 37.
-Thirty-seven?

28:46.810 --> 28:48.019
Yeah.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.688
What ----ing creams
are you using?

28:49.729 --> 28:53.233
Okay, ordinary. What?

28:53.274 --> 28:55.443
Is that a trampoline,
shut the [bleep] up.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.861
Crazy!

28:56.903 --> 28:58.488
Go ahead and enjoy some toys,
and I'll see you later.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.782
All right, sounds good.

29:00.824 --> 29:04.744
What do you think?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.204
He's 37 years old.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.039
-What's wrong with that?
-That's excellent.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.082
Yeah, that's perfect.

29:09.124 --> 29:10.667
That's the maturity you want.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.044
Yeah, you never know, he could
be the love of your life.

29:15.130 --> 29:18.591
All right, do you wanna
come have a slide? Let's go!

29:18.633 --> 29:19.843
I'm ready.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.720
Whoa!

29:21.761 --> 29:24.139
-And go!
-Woo!

29:24.180 --> 29:26.224
Go next, let's go, guys.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.027
-Dave?
-Yeah?

29:37.068 --> 29:40.155
So, dinner is the wine pairing.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.698
For tonight?

29:41.740 --> 29:43.533
Yeah, yeah, I'm just panicking
a bit about the...

29:43.575 --> 29:45.785
I need your help.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.120
This is ----ing ridiculous.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.329
What's up?

29:48.371 --> 29:49.664
There's no clamp
for this machine.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.916
I just need you to,
like, hold it,

29:51.958 --> 29:53.835
so I can just do it properly.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.712
-Hold where?
-Okay.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.297
That's it.

29:57.339 --> 30:02.677
Maybe I can just multitask
and talk to you here now.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.387
So, the menu...

30:04.429 --> 30:07.265
smoked tuna tartare, so
that's just like a plated...

30:07.307 --> 30:08.892
But I wanna put it all on
the table at the same time.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.353
Oh, really?
Oh, okay.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.396
I've got my wine pairing,
but I might just...

30:13.438 --> 30:16.274
I think it's gonna be too much.

30:16.316 --> 30:19.069
I might do shot pairing
instead for some dishes,

30:19.110 --> 30:23.698
and wine pairing for others.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.242
I have no idea what she's
thinking or what she...

30:26.284 --> 30:27.911
I don't even know how she feels

30:27.952 --> 30:30.663
she's gonna do a wine pairing
if we're doing buffet.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.832
You can't just...
what did you just eat?

30:32.874 --> 30:34.084
Hang on, stop...

30:34.125 --> 30:36.169
oh, no,
try the chardonnay with this.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.712
Oh, well, no, you try the rosé.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.589
Honestly, I'm doing street food.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.509
Like, gimme a can
of beer, blimey.

30:47.222 --> 30:49.182
[chuckles]

30:49.224 --> 30:50.558
Well, at least you know
how to make pasta now.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.063
-I'm gonna...
-Come here.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.195
What?

31:02.237 --> 31:03.738
He's out of control.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.032
I asked him to do something
and he didn't do it.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.826
And then when he said
that he did,

31:07.867 --> 31:10.203
and it was blatantly
not what I asked him to do

31:10.245 --> 31:11.871
for the hundredth time,
he just lost it.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.208
I've gotta completely change my
mindset when it comes to Jason.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.335
Now that I've been put
into this position,

31:17.377 --> 31:19.796
he's gonna be my
biggest challenge

31:19.838 --> 31:22.132
in terms of team management.

31:22.173 --> 31:23.633
Yeah, I need to go reset.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.261
If I can help you, I will.
I'm just very busy.

31:26.302 --> 31:27.804
You don't need to help me.
Focus on you.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.264
Definitely a kiss later.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.890
I need Jesus,
that's what I need.

31:30.932 --> 31:34.436
Mzi, Mzi, Storm, could you just
come see me on the bow, quickly?

31:34.477 --> 31:36.730
I just wanna chat the slide
before we start bringing it in.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.440
Copy that.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.070
-Best way to do it...
-Yeah.

31:44.112 --> 31:47.907
Run lines from that side to that
side, and then create a holder,

31:47.949 --> 31:49.451
lift that up with the crane,

31:49.492 --> 31:51.578
and as that's coming up,
we're gonna fold it down.

31:51.619 --> 31:52.579
Okay.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.914
Okay, this seems,
like, promising.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.583
How long has it been?

31:56.624 --> 31:59.085
Since November...
kiss, hug, anything.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.086
-Are you kidding?
-Since November.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.130
-Why is that?
-Work.

32:02.172 --> 32:07.135
-You poor thing.
-Yeah.

32:07.177 --> 32:09.554
Okay, I'm gonna
go get my uniform on.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.431
I'm very against this constant,
like, state of you appearing

32:11.473 --> 32:12.515
and me thinking you're
gonna hang out, and then you,

32:12.557 --> 32:14.351
like, going back to the kitchen.

32:14.392 --> 32:15.852
-It's really pissing me off.
-It's pissing me off.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.437
But actually low-key,
I'm on a break, so...

32:17.479 --> 32:19.064
-Are you?
-Yeah.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.190
What are you doing,
just sit down.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.150
Okay, what's the goss, sis?

32:24.569 --> 32:27.155
Okay, well, let me just
vent a little bit.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.199
Just for the record,
this is a Red Bull.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.617
So, everybody knows.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.327
Just to stay awake and
get this party going.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.953
Let's take a quick picture.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.414
I feel like we're higher
maintenance than the primary.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.249
-A little bit.
-Yeah.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.292
[laughing]

32:39.334 --> 32:41.002
I'm like, this is my dream.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.921
Jesus Christ.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.381
Kyle is such a flirt.

32:44.422 --> 32:46.049
He's just sitting
out there, isn't he?

32:46.091 --> 32:49.094
A little one-two flirter, I
guess someone's gotta do it.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.762
There's a certain line
with the guests.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.389
Like, if you're, like,
attracted to someone,

32:52.430 --> 32:54.057
like, obviously, you're
gonna flirt with them.

32:54.099 --> 32:55.892
But, like, I don't think he
goes to sleep with someone,

32:55.934 --> 32:57.185
like, go to a guest cabin and,

32:57.227 --> 33:00.063
you know, do the devil's
deed down there.

33:00.105 --> 33:03.024
But you know, if you
wanted to have a quick kiss,

33:03.066 --> 33:04.734
then who's to stop you?

33:06.528 --> 33:07.821
Yeah...

33:07.862 --> 33:09.239
No!

33:09.280 --> 33:10.490
Yeah.

33:12.701 --> 33:16.037
Jason, can you take the
trampoline and swim it over?

33:16.079 --> 33:18.790
We're gonna lift it
and put it in the cradle.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.712
-Shut up.
-----ing hell.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.630
If you're a skipper,
you can do it, can't ya?

33:25.672 --> 33:27.590
I may have a problem
with authority

33:27.632 --> 33:29.551
when I very much think that
they're 100 percent wrong.

33:29.592 --> 33:32.679
I can't actively do something
poorly if I know a better,

33:32.721 --> 33:34.848
more efficient, and
proper way of doing it.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.266
----ing amateur hour.

33:36.307 --> 33:39.519
Mate, just tie it around
your ankle and go for a swim.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.855
Oh, my God, I'm ----ing
dealing with an imbecile.

33:41.896 --> 33:42.856
-Huh?
-Court?

33:42.897 --> 33:43.898
Yeah?

33:43.940 --> 33:45.191
You wanna throw this
above your head?

33:45.233 --> 33:46.484
Because we'll give him a hand.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.694
----ing hell,
I'll do everything.

33:47.736 --> 33:49.404
Is he all right?

33:49.446 --> 33:51.698
Yeah, just being dramatic,
like always.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.409
It just feels like Jason doesn't
actually really want to be here.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.119
He wants to go on being
skipper on a small boat.

33:56.161 --> 33:57.662
That's great, go do it.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.247
But if you're gonna work on
a yacht with people

33:59.289 --> 34:01.249
that are always telling
each other what to do...

34:07.756 --> 34:10.759
Opa!

34:10.800 --> 34:13.094
----ing hell,
it's, like, 15 knots.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.096
This thing's gonna ----ing
flap in the wind.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.639
We need a secondary line.

34:16.681 --> 34:17.474
Jason.

34:17.515 --> 34:19.642
Jason!
[whistles]

34:19.684 --> 34:21.227
We need a secondary line,
it's too windy.

34:21.269 --> 34:24.481
-I've got one ready to throw.
-Yeah, yeah, thank you.

34:24.522 --> 34:27.150
Jason!
[whistles]

34:27.192 --> 34:30.403
Jason!

34:30.445 --> 34:32.405
He's just flat-out ignoring me.

34:32.447 --> 34:33.656
Are you ----ing kidding me?

34:38.536 --> 34:41.956
Jason, we need a secondary line,
it's too windy.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.124
Jason!

34:43.166 --> 34:44.209
[whistles]

34:44.250 --> 34:46.711
Jason!

34:46.753 --> 34:48.296
He's just flat-out ignoring me.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.798
Are you ----ing kidding me?

34:49.839 --> 34:51.132
Gonna bring it down slowly.

34:51.174 --> 34:53.051
Yeah, it's coming down.

34:53.093 --> 34:55.637
One sec. Okay.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.305
That was outrageous, brü.

34:57.347 --> 35:00.058
Flat-out ignored me.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.935
Today's been so intense.

35:01.976 --> 35:04.396
Jason has been
insubordinate to me.

35:04.437 --> 35:06.064
Like, when he was telling me
to [bleep] off

35:06.106 --> 35:07.816
and sh--, just, like, dude.

35:07.857 --> 35:10.777
I'm not quite sure entirely
what he's super good at,

35:10.819 --> 35:12.904
but I guess it's up to me
to try to find that

35:12.946 --> 35:14.989
and then to, like,
motivate him to do that.

35:15.031 --> 35:17.158
I still have a lot
to learn with Jason.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.036
Can you just go change
into blacks, please?

35:20.078 --> 35:21.454
Yeah.

35:26.543 --> 35:28.878
-Nat?
-Yes?

35:30.005 --> 35:32.007
All right.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.174
Sure.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.592
Hello, my love.

35:34.634 --> 35:37.053
I'm just gonna put
champagne glasses on.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.099
Well, yeah,
it's around the world.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.853
<i>Storm, Storm, can you</i>
<i>come to the bridge?</i>

35:44.894 --> 35:46.187
Copy that.

35:46.229 --> 35:47.981
Well, how do you wanna do
the wine with a buffet?

35:48.023 --> 35:51.234
Okay, I could go around and
say I'm just gonna pour you

35:51.276 --> 35:55.030
a bit of the this, pairs nicely
with your smoked tartare,

35:55.071 --> 35:57.323
which I recommend your
start your meal with.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.075
Then...

35:59.117 --> 36:00.994
That's how I liked
wanted everyone to know.

36:01.036 --> 36:02.829
So, we're gonna go out and say,
I suggest you start with this.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.039
-I... yeah.
-Perfect.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.790
Yes, Cap?

36:05.832 --> 36:07.625
You know what an anchor
drag looks like?

36:07.667 --> 36:08.877
Yeah, it kind of
looks like a...

36:08.918 --> 36:10.170
-That.
-Sort of that, exactly, yeah.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.755
Let's start zigzagging.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.465
I watched the swing
and the compass.

36:13.506 --> 36:14.716
Sure.

36:14.758 --> 36:15.967
When you know an
anchor's holding,

36:16.009 --> 36:17.177
it won't go
all the way around.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.178
Yeah.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.554
Let's see where it goes.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.015
She's going.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.434
Yeah, because it's going to
that edge right there, see?

36:24.476 --> 36:25.769
Yeah.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.771
Okay, and we're coming
back around now.

36:27.812 --> 36:29.689
-See that?
-Yeah.

36:29.731 --> 36:31.399
And when you're on anchor watch,
that's what you watch.

36:31.441 --> 36:32.734
Yeah.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.070
What I see in Storm
is bosun material.

36:35.111 --> 36:38.073
He is great on deck,
he's great with the client.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.116
It's important that
I teach Storm,

36:40.158 --> 36:42.577
because he has never
done this before,

36:42.619 --> 36:44.412
and I want him to succeed.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.706
And make sure they know
it's okay to knock on my door.

36:46.748 --> 36:48.958
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.003
Anyway, thanks.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.839
-Yeah, yeah, 100 percent.
-Okay.

36:54.881 --> 36:57.133
-Make me look fresh.
-I will.

37:02.138 --> 37:05.058
Beautiful.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.851
Tonight, dinner around
the world dinner,

37:06.893 --> 37:10.313
and I wanna do a buffet-style
street food sort of vibe.

37:10.355 --> 37:13.024
We're gonna go to France,
smoked tuna tartare;

37:13.066 --> 37:15.694
Italy, lobster ravioli
with a bisque;

37:15.735 --> 37:18.405
China, mushroom-glazed
truffle bao buns;

37:18.446 --> 37:21.950
England, fish and chips;
America, Wagyu beef sliders.

37:21.991 --> 37:25.203
Nice, one-bite kind of
wonder food, you know?

37:25.245 --> 37:26.705
This is tonight's menu.

37:26.746 --> 37:27.997
We have a wine pairing.

37:28.039 --> 37:29.457
Ooh, I like this!

37:29.499 --> 37:31.751
Where can we find wine to
go with each, like, where...

37:31.793 --> 37:33.670
-We're gonna do that for you.
-I'm so ready!

37:33.712 --> 37:34.963
-Yeah, oh, my God.
-Yeah.

37:35.005 --> 37:36.965
No, you killed it
today, thank you.

37:37.007 --> 37:40.969
It's really nice to have
someone to, like, just rely on.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.262
Thanks.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.514
-Bonsoir.
-Bonjour!

37:44.556 --> 37:45.682
Did you hear what we're doing?

37:45.724 --> 37:47.142
Having a classy dinner?

37:47.183 --> 37:48.560
Period.

37:48.601 --> 37:51.438
Dave, be prepared just to
get the tartare out first.

37:51.479 --> 37:53.231
I mean, it'd probably be
better for us,

37:53.273 --> 37:57.819
just for wine introductions,
but it's up to you.

37:57.861 --> 37:59.988
So, I'll send the
tuna tartare up.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.197
Just so we can get
the drinks started.

38:01.239 --> 38:02.490
Okay.

38:02.532 --> 38:05.535
I think it'd be better,
do you not?

38:05.577 --> 38:11.124
Yeah.

38:11.166 --> 38:14.002
For your first course
this evening we actually

38:14.044 --> 38:16.713
have a 2019 sauvignon blanc,
and it pairs well

38:16.755 --> 38:19.049
with the tuna tartare
that you're about to eat,

38:19.090 --> 38:22.427
because it's very dry,
crisp, and elegant.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.637
-Yay!
-Thank you.

38:28.975 --> 38:32.520
-Fire.
-Thank you.

38:32.562 --> 38:33.521
Yay!

38:33.563 --> 38:35.357
Oh, wow.

38:35.398 --> 38:38.651
Oh, my God, this is so fresh.

38:38.693 --> 38:39.652
I love this.

38:39.694 --> 38:40.653
This is amazing.

38:40.695 --> 38:41.654
Mm-hmm, mm.

38:41.696 --> 38:42.655
I want, like, six of these.

38:42.697 --> 38:43.865
I want a bowl of it.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.033
Me, too.

38:46.576 --> 38:48.328
Cheers, queers.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.538
This is amazing.

38:50.580 --> 38:51.623
I love these plates.

38:51.664 --> 38:53.083
Yeah.

38:53.124 --> 38:54.709
To see these guests
loving that enhanced experience

38:54.751 --> 39:00.215
with the wine pairing makes
me feel rewarded.

39:00.256 --> 39:03.551
So, I just wanna keep it
going throughout this dinner.

39:03.593 --> 39:06.554
-All good, Tash?
-Yeah, it's fab.

39:06.596 --> 39:08.014
They're loving the wine pairing.

39:08.056 --> 39:11.643
Do you want me to just do
one at a time, then?

39:11.685 --> 39:12.852
Is that fine, or is it just...

39:12.894 --> 39:14.270
That's fine, that's fine, no.

39:14.312 --> 39:15.522
Just so I can introduce
each wine and everything.

39:15.563 --> 39:16.940
I think it's a bit nicer,

39:16.981 --> 39:18.733
they're enjoying it a
bit more elegant, and...

39:18.775 --> 39:19.943
If that's better for you,
then let's do that.

39:19.984 --> 39:21.319
This is a huge change.

39:21.361 --> 39:23.530
We spoke about that we
were gonna do a buffet,

39:23.571 --> 39:25.490
there's no need to do
a wine pairing.

39:25.532 --> 39:28.076
And now it has to be a la carte,

39:28.118 --> 39:30.203
which is going to affect
the quality of my food.

39:30.245 --> 39:33.415
But Natasha promised the guests,
and I don't have a choice.

39:33.456 --> 39:36.918
It's not ideal, but I'm
gonna try and suck it up.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.421
All right, I need to
change my whole situation.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.339
We need more plates, eh?

39:52.225 --> 39:54.144
-Ooh, a new wine.
-So, here we have a new one.

39:54.185 --> 39:55.145
Ooh, okay.

39:55.186 --> 39:57.439
So, this is the
pinot grigio 2020.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.609
This one is also quite dry.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.111
----ing hell.

40:03.153 --> 40:06.614
It'll work perfectly with
your lobster ravioli,

40:06.656 --> 40:08.533
with your bisque to come next.

40:08.575 --> 40:09.743
Have you got a tray there, mate?

40:09.784 --> 40:11.286
Grey tray,
what type of tray?

40:11.327 --> 40:14.956
What if all wine tastes
the exact same to you?

40:14.998 --> 40:17.459
I need to hurry up,
all my food's getting ----ed.

40:17.500 --> 40:18.877
This is ridiculous.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.503
Do you need any more?

40:20.545 --> 40:21.546
No, you guys can go down.

40:21.588 --> 40:22.756
Thank you.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.466
We have lobster ravioli
in front of you.

40:24.507 --> 40:26.134
Ooh!

40:26.176 --> 40:27.886
It's a single ravioli,
how bougie.

40:27.927 --> 40:30.305
-I love this wine.
-Mm-hmm.

40:30.347 --> 40:31.723
[bleep]

40:35.518 --> 40:37.103
-Night.
-Good night.

40:37.145 --> 40:38.688
Ah.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.149
Tash, if you give us about 10
minutes, I'll come and help you.

40:41.191 --> 40:42.442
Okay.

40:42.484 --> 40:46.613
Why is he so good?

40:46.654 --> 40:48.031
Oh sh--.

40:48.073 --> 40:49.366
Have you got the plates
ready for the next course,

40:49.407 --> 40:51.076
which are the bao buns?

40:51.117 --> 40:55.413
I've got another set of plates
if you need them urgently, okay?

40:55.455 --> 40:57.165
This is ----ing ridiculous.

40:57.207 --> 40:59.000
So, right now the wine pairing

40:59.042 --> 41:02.796
has slowed down the service
so much my food is drying out.

41:02.837 --> 41:06.508
I'm reheating multiple dishes.

41:06.549 --> 41:07.884
My burgers are ----ed .

41:07.926 --> 41:10.178
Can we go on the burgers next?

41:10.220 --> 41:11.596
Oh, right, yeah.

41:11.638 --> 41:14.349
This chef... mm.

41:14.391 --> 41:17.686
-Two, four, six.
-Is that all you need?

41:17.727 --> 41:20.188
Okay.

41:20.230 --> 41:23.149
So, for the next course
we have a Chianti classic.

41:23.191 --> 41:29.030
It's got very strong
notes of plum.

41:29.072 --> 41:31.950
It pairs well with
the next bao bun

41:31.991 --> 41:35.120
with glazed wild mushrooms
and black truffle.

41:41.626 --> 41:43.837
Oh, my God.

41:43.878 --> 41:45.005
-Wow.
-Thank you.

41:45.046 --> 41:48.842
All food should
have sticks in it.

41:48.883 --> 41:50.510
Is this the slider
or the pork bun?

41:50.552 --> 41:56.224
Dave, what's coming next, so
I can serve the next wine?

41:56.266 --> 41:57.517
Oh, I thought that
was the bao buns.

41:57.559 --> 41:59.227
I told you that we changed.

41:59.269 --> 42:01.730
It says Wagyu beef slider, so
I assume that's what this is.

42:01.771 --> 42:02.856
Oh, okay.

42:02.897 --> 42:04.065
It's out of order now, though.

42:04.107 --> 42:05.942
-What country is this?
-America.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.319
Sh-- I said the bao buns were
coming next and...

42:08.361 --> 42:12.032
-Oh [bleep].
-How embarrassing.

42:12.073 --> 42:14.284
I just need to go around
with the next wine.

42:14.325 --> 42:17.495
It was mistakenly
paired with the wrong food.

42:22.459 --> 42:23.918
That's what I said.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.420
Ooh, yay.

42:25.462 --> 42:28.798
For your next course, we have
Veuve Cliquot champagne.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.884
-Veuve, Veuve!
-Yay!

42:30.925 --> 42:33.136
It's a nice palate cleanser.

42:33.178 --> 42:35.472
Champagne's universal.

42:35.513 --> 42:37.599
We need to get
the other glasses out.

42:37.640 --> 42:40.393
This was supposed to be a
buffet, not a wine pairing.

42:40.435 --> 42:43.605
We need to change
this sh--.

42:43.646 --> 42:45.607
This is crazy.

42:45.648 --> 42:46.941
Deck crew, Natasha,

42:46.983 --> 42:50.236
is anyone able to please
help us on the interior?

42:50.278 --> 42:51.780
We need to simplify it, babe.

42:51.821 --> 42:53.239
We don't have that
staff capability.

42:53.281 --> 42:54.657
We couldn't have done
wine pairing otherwise.

42:54.699 --> 42:56.868
The last thing you wanna
do is just have a service

42:56.910 --> 42:58.244
that does not seem seamless.

42:58.286 --> 42:59.662
The plates that are coming down,

42:59.704 --> 43:01.081
the glasses that
are coming down,

43:01.122 --> 43:03.041
it's a lot to deal
with between two people.

43:03.083 --> 43:06.711
The wine pairing, nice
idea sh---ass planning.

43:06.753 --> 43:08.588
Brace a bitch.

43:08.630 --> 43:09.923
This is insane.

43:09.964 --> 43:11.341
It's not me!

43:14.344 --> 43:16.012
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:16.054 --> 43:17.514
Come have a look at this.

43:17.555 --> 43:18.682
Ah!

43:18.723 --> 43:22.143
[laughing]

43:22.185 --> 43:27.607
Welcome to the mini-Olympics
on board Motor Yacht Home.

43:27.649 --> 43:28.650
Okay, am I clear to swing?

43:28.692 --> 43:30.151
I'm all for new ideas,

43:30.193 --> 43:31.528
especially when I'm trying
to pull this whole

43:31.569 --> 43:34.614
----ing boat in with our hands.

43:34.656 --> 43:35.907
it's, like, dangerous.

43:35.949 --> 43:37.575
[bleep] I'm scared.

43:37.617 --> 43:39.035
Where the [bleep] is Jason?

43:39.077 --> 43:41.162
I said to take 15,
it's been 45.

43:41.204 --> 43:42.247
Where's your radio?

43:42.288 --> 43:43.707
I've called you three times.

43:43.748 --> 43:45.333
-Yeah, I'm...
-[bleep].

43:45.375 --> 43:46.501
You need to respond, so I know
that you've heard it.

43:46.543 --> 43:49.796
I would...

43:49.838 --> 43:53.008
No, he didn't.

43:53.049 --> 43:54.801
My boyfriend's having
issues with me

43:54.843 --> 43:56.970
continuing to work with Dave.

43:57.012 --> 44:01.391
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

44:01.433 --> 44:03.685
I've already got such a
full morning ahead of me,

44:03.727 --> 44:06.271
so when Tash and Kyle
leave the place like a pigsty,

44:06.312 --> 44:08.857
that just, like, puts
me through the roof.

44:08.898 --> 44:10.567
Ugh!
