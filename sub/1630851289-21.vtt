17:17.111 --> 17:18.202
-Guys.
-Oh, darn.

17:18.429 --> 17:19.686
Well,
they still have to find us.

17:19.781 --> 17:21.614
OFFICER:
Bots in the unpopular
restaurant,

17:21.708 --> 17:24.116
come out with your hands up!
We have you surrounded!

17:24.210 --> 17:26.711
-Shoot.
-Well, at least
they don't have us surrounded.

17:26.821 --> 17:28.421
Oh, wait. Ding-dang it.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.201
We repeat,
come out with your bot hands up!

17:34.295 --> 17:36.128
You're all getting super wiped!

17:36.222 --> 17:37.704
-(click)
-Oops, I dead-bolted the door.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.116
Hey, there's a bunch of cops
in the back alley. Oh.

17:40.134 --> 17:41.375
Out in front, too, huh?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.619
Yeah, we don't know
what that's about.

17:43.712 --> 17:44.896
So strange.

17:45.047 --> 17:46.505
Well, the windows
are bulletproof,

17:46.657 --> 17:48.549
and the walls
are reinforced concrete.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.518
I put all that in.
Very reasonable cost.

17:50.628 --> 17:53.462

Yeah, 'cause things
got kind of dystopian

17:53.631 --> 17:54.739

Oh, yeah. I forgot. We have
a secret tunnel in the basement.

19:57.755 --> 20:00.031
If that's, like,
something you're interested in.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.091
It's for if things ever got
extra dystopian.

20:02.109 --> 20:03.367
It opens out
at the end of the block.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.203
Good if you need
to run out for wine, too.

20:05.354 --> 20:07.354
-You zip out, you zip back.
-Okay, I'm embarrassed

20:07.373 --> 20:09.040
we didn't mention
the secret tunnel before.

20:09.191 --> 20:11.450
By the way,
nobody's peed in it ever.

20:11.602 --> 20:13.544
Yep, yep, okay.
Uh, can we see it?

-(shouting)

20:18.218 --> 20:19.700
-No!
-CHIEF: You're coming with us.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.553
We're taking you to the nearest
available wiping station.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.539
-Hey, where is that?
-That's, uh,
Wagstell Manufacturing, Chief.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.874

Come on!

20:27.969 --> 20:29.710

-Run!

20:29.729 --> 20:31.044
(shouting)

20:31.064 --> 20:33.213
Oh, that's a lot to clean up.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.732
(grunting)

20:34.809 --> 20:37.068
I won't let them wipe you front
to back, Jimmy Butt-erd Jr.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.070
I won't let them wipe anybody.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.404
I have to do something.

20:40.631 --> 20:42.240
I have to do something
to stop them.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.983
It's kind of the key
to the segment.

20:44.151 --> 20:45.985
You can see them drawing
right on the screen,

20:46.153 --> 20:47.319
screen, screen, screen...

20:47.413 --> 20:48.471
That's it, then.

20:48.564 --> 20:50.931
I'm gonna touch
that touch screen hard.

20:50.933 --> 20:52.083

20:52.234 --> 20:53.751
We have a hammer, right? Yeah.
