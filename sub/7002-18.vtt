00:13.813 --> 00:18.049
What? What do you want now?

00:18.050 --> 00:21.452
Can't you hear
those annoying sounds?

00:21.453 --> 00:24.555
I told you not to eat
that bean dip.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.599
<i>(pecking)</i>

00:36.335 --> 00:39.037
It's that stupid
woodpecker again.

<i>(pecking)</i>

00:47.312 --> 00:49.347

Hey!

00:56.022 --> 00:57.789
<i>(pecking)</i>

00:58.858 --> 01:01.425
Now he's had it.

01:01.426 --> 01:03.728
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get rid
of that woodpecker.

01:03.729 --> 01:05.864
No! Not with my robe.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.999
I'm just gonna
shoo him away.
<i>(groans)</i>

01:11.904 --> 01:13.905
Come on.

01:13.906 --> 01:16.274
Go away.

01:16.275 --> 01:18.376
Darn gutter!

01:21.246 --> 01:22.446
What was that?

01:22.447 --> 01:24.849
Nothin'.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.295
<i>(sighs)</i>

03:04.784 --> 03:07.018
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:11.056 --> 03:13.491
Brad, come on. The bus
will be here any minute.

03:13.492 --> 03:15.526
Mom, I don't
feel too good.

03:15.527 --> 03:18.062
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I think I have a fever.

03:20.032 --> 03:22.033
You don't
feel hot to me.

03:22.034 --> 03:23.701
But here, I'll take
your temperature.

03:23.702 --> 03:25.069
What's the matter
with brad?

03:25.070 --> 03:28.439
He's dumb, and he's got
a dorky haircut.

03:29.875 --> 03:33.878
Paging dr. Shot.
Dr. Rim shot.

03:33.879 --> 03:35.313
Hmm.

03:36.548 --> 03:38.549
Oh, dad!

03:38.550 --> 03:40.018
My... My hair.

03:40.019 --> 03:42.653
Oh, you're fine.
Where's your little slingshot?

03:42.654 --> 03:44.722
In the drawer.
Mom took it away from me

03:44.723 --> 03:47.025
After I pelted
harold hanson
in the butt.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.128
Here you go, brad.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.495
Keep it there.

03:51.496 --> 03:53.097
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No. Come on.

03:53.098 --> 03:56.734
You're not gonna use
that slingshot on that
poor little woodpecker.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.536
I was just gonna use
a little pebble,
hit him in the head

03:58.537 --> 04:01.439
And take away some of his
short-term memory.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.108
Mom, can I have some bread
to feed my woodpecker?

04:04.109 --> 04:06.277
Don't feed the woodpecker.
No, don't do that.

04:06.278 --> 04:08.779
But pete looks hungry.
His name's not pete.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.614
He doesn't have a name.
It's a woodpecker. It's a pest.

04:10.615 --> 04:12.516
He's gone. He's outta here.
Goodbye, charlie.

04:12.517 --> 04:15.453
You mean I could
call him charlie?
No!

04:15.454 --> 04:16.687
Don't hurt pete!

04:16.688 --> 04:19.423
It's charlie.
It's nobody!

04:22.194 --> 04:24.128
Why are you sticking that
in mom's coffee?

04:24.129 --> 04:25.930
I need to get
a high temperature fast.

04:25.931 --> 04:28.499
I didn't do
my math homework.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.401
So just copy jennifer's.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.536
I can't.
I broke up with her.

04:32.537 --> 04:34.638
You broke up
with jennifer? Why?

04:34.639 --> 04:37.675
She said I couldn't copy
her homework anymore.

04:39.711 --> 04:44.148
Well, for 20 bucks,
I'll do your math, and you
don't have to date me.

04:44.149 --> 04:45.149
Here comes mom.

04:45.150 --> 04:46.918
Aaargh!

04:50.555 --> 04:52.023
What's wrong?

04:52.024 --> 04:54.158
My tongue hurts.

04:54.159 --> 04:57.929
Oh, god, I hope
you don't have strep throat.
I have to go to work today.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.034
108.

05:05.237 --> 05:10.008
I don't know whether
to put you to bed
or baste you.

05:10.009 --> 05:13.044
What's goin' on at school?
<i>(lisping)</i> nothing.
I love school.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.479
Well, that's good.
Then you won't mind going.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.548
Get going. Get ready.
Oh, man!

05:17.549 --> 05:19.817
Guess I'd better
get my books.
Not so fast.

05:21.686 --> 05:25.123
Why doesn't brad
wanna go to school?
Uh...

05:25.124 --> 05:27.892
'cause he and
jennifer broke up.

05:27.893 --> 05:29.894
They did? Why?
What happened?

05:29.895 --> 05:32.330
I don't know.

05:32.331 --> 05:35.099
Well, she must have dumped him,
or he wouldn't be so depressed.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.667
Yeah, that's it.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.571
You know how sensitive
brad is.

05:46.578 --> 05:48.879
His little heart
is broken.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.416
And his little tongue
is burned.

05:53.585 --> 05:56.287
Don't make jokes.
This is a sad thing
that's happened to him.

05:56.288 --> 05:59.023
<i>(horn honks)</i>
hey, brad,
the bus is here!

05:59.024 --> 06:01.659
Mark! Come on.
The bus is here. Brad!

06:01.660 --> 06:05.330
Brad, honey. Honey,
have a good day at school.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.265
Button your coat up.
Bye-bye!
Bye, guys.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.635
Woodpecker's not building
a nest out there.
There's twigs everywhere.

06:11.636 --> 06:14.172
He's building a city.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.241
Skyscrapers,
subways, minimarts.

06:17.242 --> 06:19.177
It's peckerville
out there, honey.

06:21.213 --> 06:23.714
Jennifer broke up with brad.

06:23.715 --> 06:26.517
That's why he didn't
wanna go to school -
he couldn't face her.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.953
Isn't that heartbreaking?

06:28.954 --> 06:32.790
Yeah. I gotta find a better way
to get rid of that woodpecker.

06:32.791 --> 06:34.592
You are so callous.

06:34.593 --> 06:37.928
Jill, he's 12. Girls will
come and go in his life, ok?

06:37.929 --> 06:39.730
Jennifer's his first love.

06:39.731 --> 06:41.966
It hurts when you lose
your first love.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.768
I don't have
to worry about that.
I see mine every day.

06:46.071 --> 06:47.805
That is so sweet.

06:47.806 --> 06:50.475
You should meet her
sometime.

06:54.079 --> 06:56.180
<i>(airhorn blows)</i>

06:56.181 --> 06:59.717
Come on. They can hear that
all over the neighborhood.

06:59.718 --> 07:04.588
I can't take this.
That bird's mocking me,
sittin' up there smilin'.

07:04.589 --> 07:07.525
He's got a beak.
He can't smile.

07:07.526 --> 07:11.295
Your mom's got a beak.
She smiles now and then.

07:11.296 --> 07:13.464
I think you should call
a professional.

07:13.465 --> 07:16.000
I don't need
a professional. Hey.

07:16.001 --> 07:17.902
I'll just hook this up
to the compressor

07:17.903 --> 07:20.038
And vaporize that
little bird butt.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.074
You need professional help.
I do not need
an exterminator.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.376
I meant a psychiatrist.

07:25.377 --> 07:28.046
Hey, randy,
I'm in big trouble.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.747
What's the matter?

07:29.748 --> 07:31.782
Well, I flunked another
math assignment.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.484
Mom and dad
are gonna kill me.

07:33.485 --> 07:36.487
Maybe not. Mom thought
you were upset this morning

07:36.488 --> 07:38.389
Because jennifer
dumped you.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.025
But I'm the one
who dumped her.

07:41.026 --> 07:43.394
Yeah, well,
mom doesn't know that.

07:43.395 --> 07:45.229
You can milk this thing.

07:45.230 --> 07:49.167
Make her think
you're having trouble in math
because you're really lovesick.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.802
Hey, that's
a great idea.

07:51.803 --> 07:55.540
Hey, guys, I got a way
to get rid of the woodpecker.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.209
I got the old
binford blastmaster
out, right?

07:58.210 --> 08:01.546
I'm gonna run 2,000
pulsating decibels
through that horn.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.681
That's a great idea.
Huh?

08:04.816 --> 08:06.917
You look like a big geek.

08:06.918 --> 08:09.387
All right.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.661
No, sir. No, I don't
want it killed.

08:17.662 --> 08:20.131
Don't you have any
nonviolent exterminators
there?

08:22.367 --> 08:24.569
Well, then why do you
have this ad here

08:24.570 --> 08:27.871
With this happy little mouse
hitchhiking down the highway?

08:30.109 --> 08:32.376
Well, he should have
his teeny little head
caught in a trap

08:32.376 --> 08:35.413
And cheese dribbling out
the side of his mouth.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.481
Well...

08:36.482 --> 08:38.482
Hello?

08:38.484 --> 08:41.751
He hung up on me.
That is so rude.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.121
Hi, mom.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.957
Oh. Hi, honey.
How are you?

08:46.958 --> 08:49.293
Not so good.
Jennifer dumped me.

08:49.294 --> 08:51.329
I know.
Randy told me.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.098
I'm sorry, brad, but I knew
mom would understand.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.803
You must be
pretty bummed, huh?

08:59.804 --> 09:01.772
Is there anything
I can do for you?

09:01.773 --> 09:03.807
Could you get me
some milk and cookies?

09:03.808 --> 09:05.009
Yeah. Ok.

09:07.212 --> 09:11.182
So, brad... You wanna
talk about jennifer?

09:11.183 --> 09:13.484
I don't think I can.

09:13.485 --> 09:16.487
I bet seeing her in class
makes it hard to think.

09:16.488 --> 09:18.989
Boy, are you right.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.525
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

09:20.526 --> 09:22.960
I'll get it.

09:22.961 --> 09:24.995
Brad, I know how hard
this must be,

09:24.996 --> 09:26.930
But you're gonna meet
lots of other girls,

09:26.931 --> 09:29.767
And I guarantee you
you could find somebody
a whole lot better than...

09:29.768 --> 09:32.170
Jennifer! Hi!

09:32.171 --> 09:35.039
We were just talking about you.
Do you want some cookies?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.707
No. I just need
to talk to bradley.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.710
Oh. That's good.
That's good. Here.

09:39.711 --> 09:43.080
Randy, come and get
some milk. Come on.

09:43.081 --> 09:46.317
This isn't a good time.
This won't take long.

09:46.318 --> 09:50.087
Here's your math workbook.
Good luck finding someone else
to do your homework.

09:50.088 --> 09:54.425
Wait. Jennifer, jennifer,
jennifer, jennifer. Wait.

09:54.426 --> 09:58.196
I'm really sad we're not
going out anymore.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.464
Then why did you say
you'd only go out with me

10:00.465 --> 10:02.667
If I let you copy
my homework?

10:02.668 --> 10:04.768
Goodbye, bradley.

10:13.378 --> 10:16.113
Bradley michael taylor.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.583
Is that true?
Have you been copying
her homework?

10:18.584 --> 10:21.885
Mom, could we not
talk about this now?

10:21.886 --> 10:23.987
I'm very sad.

10:25.123 --> 10:27.825
Oh, shut up!

10:27.826 --> 10:30.394
<i>(tim)</i> this blast
is for you, woody!

10:30.395 --> 10:32.663
<i>(loud buzzing)</i>

10:32.664 --> 10:34.765
Tim! Stop it!

10:40.071 --> 10:43.474
Hey, hey, hey!
I got rid of the woodpecker.

10:43.475 --> 10:47.911
Right now, he's checkin' into
the walter lantz clinic.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.484
You know what brad
has been doing?
What?

10:53.485 --> 10:55.953
Copying jennifer's
math homework.
All right!

10:58.557 --> 11:00.057
That's "no!"

11:00.058 --> 11:01.292
Well, it's hard.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.927
I can't do it.
I'm just stupid.

11:03.928 --> 11:06.230
The only stupid thing you did
was try to cheat.

11:06.231 --> 11:09.867
Getting caught
wasn't too bright, either.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.969
You can go upstairs now.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.472
Brad, you can't
go through life

11:14.473 --> 11:16.474
Havin' other people
do your work for you.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.710
What about al?
He does your work for you.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.282
Don't push me, fella.

11:24.283 --> 11:27.318
We're just really
disappointed in you. We thought
that you knew better than that.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.620
Well, it's your fault.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.455
Oh, really?
Yeah.

11:31.456 --> 11:35.393
Couple weeks ago,
you guys were so excited
when I brought home that b.

11:35.394 --> 11:38.562
I felt I had to keep on
getting good grades
to make you happy.

11:38.563 --> 11:41.432
I was just trying
to be a good son.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.805
<i>(both sob)</i>

11:51.643 --> 11:53.277
You are grounded
for a week.

11:53.278 --> 11:56.480
Why do I have to
learn how to multiply
compound fractions?

11:56.481 --> 11:57.915
I'm never gonna use them.

11:57.916 --> 12:00.117
You use 'em every day.
When?

12:00.118 --> 12:03.421
When I go to the grocery store
and I buy a pound and a half
of cheese.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.155
Yeah, but you're not
multiplying anything.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.257
Well, you didn't
let me finish.

12:07.258 --> 12:09.760
Why don't you
finish that?

12:09.761 --> 12:13.263
Well, I buy
a pound and a half of cheese,
and then I multiply that by...

12:13.264 --> 12:15.800
A gallon and a half
of milk.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.168
But why would you do that?

12:18.169 --> 12:19.704
Because...

12:19.705 --> 12:22.640
Because I'm...
Making cheese milk.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.443
Now go get your math book.

12:25.444 --> 12:28.446
We are going to teach you
how to multiply
compound fractions.

12:28.447 --> 12:29.947
Couldn't we just
punish him,

12:29.948 --> 12:33.684
Send him in his room
without his cheese milk?

12:33.685 --> 12:36.186
Get over there.
Sit down.

12:36.187 --> 12:39.523
All right, can you
get some paper out?
And I got pencils.

12:39.524 --> 12:40.858
And open up the book

12:40.859 --> 12:42.860
To the chapter
on compound fractions.

12:42.861 --> 12:46.930
Ooh! Nice, crisp pages.
Just like new.

12:46.931 --> 12:49.367
Ok, look. Where is it?

12:49.368 --> 12:50.934
Here we go.
Here we go.

12:50.935 --> 12:54.137
"multiply the denominator
and the whole number,

12:54.138 --> 12:56.540
"then add the product
to the numerator.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.409
"the sum will be

12:58.410 --> 13:01.211
"repeat the process with
the second compound fraction,

"then multiply the numerators

Convert the product
to a compound fraction."

13:08.587 --> 13:10.688
Go ahead, brad.

13:12.657 --> 13:14.592
Go ahead and what?

13:14.593 --> 13:17.728
Well, you should go ahead...
Ok, we're gonna help you
with this for the first time.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.697
All right?
So, tim, you do that.

13:21.566 --> 13:25.202
Why not? All right, everybody.
Let's... Do this first problem.

13:25.203 --> 13:28.238
"multiply 3 and 5/8

13:28.239 --> 13:33.010
Times 6 and 3/19."

13:33.011 --> 13:35.746
What?!
Well, it said...
It said, uh...

13:35.747 --> 13:37.515
"multiply the denominator."

13:37.516 --> 13:40.418
And the denominator
was... What again?

13:40.419 --> 13:43.320
The bottom number.
The bottom number.
The bottom number.

13:53.932 --> 13:57.267
Why don't they just call it
"the bottom number"?

13:57.268 --> 14:00.270
"the denominator" sounds
like a schwarzenegger movie,
doesn't it?

14:00.271 --> 14:02.873
<i>(imitates schwarzenegger)</i>
I'm the denominator.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.546
I'll give your leg
a compound fraction.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.548
Cut it out. Cut it out.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.451
I'm pretty sure it means
that they want us to multiply
that number and that one.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.385
<i>(pecking)</i>

14:15.386 --> 14:18.656
The woodpecker's back.
Oh, please. Will you
forget about the woodpecker?

14:18.657 --> 14:21.024
<i>(pecking)</i>
he's gonna wreck the roof.

14:21.025 --> 14:22.893
We're supposed to be
helping brad here.

14:22.894 --> 14:25.930
All right,
all right,
all right.

14:25.931 --> 14:29.533
Ok. All right.
Eight times three.
<i>(pecking)</i>

14:29.534 --> 14:32.035
Eight times three.
<i>(pecking)</i>

14:32.036 --> 14:35.405
Eight times three is 23.
<i>(one peck)</i>

14:35.406 --> 14:37.007
24.

14:45.617 --> 14:46.951
Hi-ho, neighbor.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.686
Hi, wilson.

14:51.255 --> 14:55.659
My, my, my. That's
an awfully big water pistol.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.028
Trying to get rid of
that woodpecker up there
on the roof.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.563
Why don't you try an owl?

14:59.564 --> 15:01.565
The owl
is the natural enemy
of the woodpecker.

15:01.566 --> 15:03.233
That's just what I need
up there - an owl.

15:03.234 --> 15:04.902
Then it wouldn't be
"tap-tap-tap."

15:04.903 --> 15:07.070
It'd be, "tap-tap-tap,
whoo-whoo-whoo,

15:07.071 --> 15:09.773
Tap-tap-tap, whoo-whoo-whoo,
tap-tap-tap, whoo-whoo-whoo."

15:09.774 --> 15:12.510
Well, it worked for motown.

15:17.281 --> 15:21.218
Actually, you don't need
a real owl. A wooden owl
will do the trick.

15:21.219 --> 15:24.488
I'll try it.
I tried everything else.

15:24.489 --> 15:28.058
I see your son brad
is assiduously poring over
his academic tomes.

15:28.059 --> 15:30.160
His what?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.097
Oh, yeah, he's studying.

15:34.098 --> 15:36.667
Hey, wilson, do you know how
to multiply compound fractions?

15:36.668 --> 15:39.570
'course I do, tim.
I love mathematics.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.338
It's one of
the building blocks
of thought.

15:41.339 --> 15:43.607
Nothing teaches order
and discipline better.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.543
You know what
galileo galilei said.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.678
Yeah, sure. 1601, florence.

15:47.679 --> 15:52.750
"why do both of my names
sound the same?"

15:52.751 --> 15:54.785
No. He said, "the universe

15:54.786 --> 15:57.054
"is written in
the language of mathematics.

15:57.055 --> 16:01.491
"its characters
are triangles, circles,
other geometric figures.

16:01.492 --> 16:02.793
"without mathematics,

16:02.794 --> 16:06.096
One wanders about
in a dark labyrinth."

16:06.097 --> 16:08.131
Labyrinth?

16:08.132 --> 16:11.035
Let's just say
a maze.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.403
I know I am.

16:13.404 --> 16:15.773
I want brad
to be a good student.
Mm-hmm.

16:15.774 --> 16:18.075
So I told him that
multiplying compound fractions

16:18.076 --> 16:19.777
Is a real important
part of that.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.112
But, you know, between
you and me, it's kinda
useless information.

16:22.113 --> 16:24.081
Well, I don't know
about that, tim.

16:24.082 --> 16:26.850
There was a time when I thought
my extensive research

16:26.851 --> 16:29.587
Into ancient tribal cultures,
obscure scientific data,

16:29.588 --> 16:32.990
The thoughts
of great philosophers,
would never come in handy.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.225
Then you moved in.

16:38.096 --> 16:39.930
For the filigree work
around the edges,

16:39.931 --> 16:42.066
I used the binford
scroll saw.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.500
Nice job, al.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.703
Thank you, tim. You can also see
how nicely it displays

16:45.704 --> 16:47.838
My mother's
teacup collection.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.506
And as a little surprise
for you, al,

16:49.507 --> 16:52.476
Here's part of your mother's
d-cup collection.

17:01.419 --> 17:02.653
<i>(thud)</i>
oh!

17:04.789 --> 17:06.723
Why don't we tell 'em
what we're doin' next?

17:09.027 --> 17:10.761
Uh, ok, well, uh...

17:10.762 --> 17:12.896
Next, we're going to be
demonstrating

17:12.896 --> 17:14.765
How to lay a new floor,

17:14.766 --> 17:18.102
But first, we need
to calculate just how much
hardwood we'll be needing.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.771
Right. And for that,
we'll be using mathematics.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.640
The language of the universe.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.242
And that's according to
ernest and julio galileo.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.114
I bet you didn't know that,
did you, al?

17:30.115 --> 17:32.016
I don't think
anyone did, tim.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.684
That's right.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.121
Our project floor here is about
eight feet by four feet.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.691
To get the square footage,
you want to multiply
those two numbers.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.560
And since I walk
the mathematical walk

17:43.561 --> 17:46.429
And talk the mathematical talk,

17:46.430 --> 17:50.901
I know that's 32 square feet.

17:50.902 --> 17:53.203
Actually, tim,
the exact measurements

17:53.204 --> 17:55.005
Are 8 and 1/2
by 4 and 1/3.

17:55.006 --> 17:57.107
What are you
gettin' at, al?

17:57.108 --> 18:01.011
Well, tim, since you
walk the mathematical walk,

18:01.012 --> 18:05.482
You need to multiply
those two numbers,
o human abacus.

18:09.854 --> 18:11.922
Well, I'd love to,
my stout little assistant,

18:11.923 --> 18:14.925
But we're outta time.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

18:14.926 --> 18:17.527
So we'll just have to
round it off to 32 square...

18:17.528 --> 18:18.996
36 and 4/5.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.031
Whatever, al.

18:21.032 --> 18:23.100
In order to get a new floor,
we gotta lift off the old floor.

18:23.101 --> 18:26.970
That's right.
And for that, we can use
a simple, basic scraper.

18:26.971 --> 18:29.239
But that wouldn't be any fun.
Let's use the dry-ice method.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.641
You just put dry ice
down there, it lifts
the asphalt tiles right up.

18:31.642 --> 18:33.376
Actually, tim...

18:33.377 --> 18:35.412
Uh... Using dry ice,

18:35.413 --> 18:38.048
You'd need an awful lot
of dry ice for that to work.

18:38.049 --> 18:41.185
For once, al,
you're totally correct.

18:41.186 --> 18:45.488
So what we'll do is,
we'll be using the...
<i>(engine starts)</i>

18:45.489 --> 18:47.891
...The simple, basic scraper.

18:47.892 --> 18:51.095
And you can pick this up
at just about any
hardware store...

19:09.080 --> 19:14.484
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford tools.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.994
<i>(jill)</i> what are you doing
to mark's toy helicopter?

19:23.995 --> 19:27.064
Mark, what have we added?
More power.

Arr-arr-arr.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.434

19:38.476 --> 19:41.478
What about the wooden owl
you put up there
to scare it away?

19:46.284 --> 19:48.986
That little woodpecker
did that?

19:48.987 --> 19:52.656
That little woodpecker,
as you call it,
has a pretty bad attitude.

19:52.657 --> 19:55.292
Mark, get the rest of my gear,
upstairs on the landing,
will you, please?

19:55.293 --> 19:56.326
Ew, yuck.

19:56.327 --> 19:57.861
Wow!

19:57.862 --> 19:59.496
Darn right wow, huh?

19:59.497 --> 20:01.531
Hey, hey!
How'd your test go?
Great. I got a c.

20:01.532 --> 20:03.000
Good. That's good.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.402
And, you know, the best thing
is you did this all yourself.

20:05.403 --> 20:07.805
Remember, math teaches us
discipline and order.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.706
Without math,

20:09.707 --> 20:13.410
Mankind just walks around

Getting a dog?
No.

20:17.548 --> 20:19.316
Am I not being clear here?

20:19.317 --> 20:22.419
If you need help
with schoolwork,
why don't you come to us?

20:22.420 --> 20:25.689
Well, it's ok,
'cause now I know how to
multiply compound fractions.

20:25.690 --> 20:29.492
Yeah? How'd he learn how
to do compound fractions?

20:29.493 --> 20:31.328
It was easy. I taught him.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.562
And who taught you?

20:32.563 --> 20:35.866
Seventh-grade math.
I just taught myself.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.235
And, mom, I forgot. I was
talking to jennifer today.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.703
Jennifer?

20:39.704 --> 20:42.472
Keep up, tim.
They got back together.
What'd she want?

20:42.473 --> 20:45.342
Well, she said
if you need any more help
with compound fractions,

20:45.343 --> 20:46.609
Call her tonight.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.448
He means, you know,
if she needs help.

20:51.449 --> 20:54.517
'cause after I mastered it,
I called her just to check,
to see if it was all right,

While captain bob
goes out and takes care
of that woodpecker.

21:16.374 --> 21:19.009
I think I should just
call the hospital
