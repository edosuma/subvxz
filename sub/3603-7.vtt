I put me up to this.
I want to hear your side.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.653
Bob is morally gray
at best. And the virus?

14:29.453 --> 14:30.659
He's toying with
a death sentence.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.283
You have the cure.
No one dies.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.909
Just because he has
a safety net,
doesn't make it ethical.

So, you would make
a different choice?
Morally un-gray?

14:41.590 --> 14:45.333

Brutally. Ripped them in half.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.051
They could've
given me the virus.

14:48.472 --> 14:52.385
But they didn't.
They've made me right
so that I could have a life,

14:52.476 --> 14:54.137

you've gone crazy again.

Who is he?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.023
Who's Adam Monroe?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.781
Adam is complicated.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.657
So uncomplicate it.

15:59.584 --> 16:04.294
Adam convinced us
that we belonged together,

16:04.381 --> 16:09.717
that we can make the world
a better place
for our children, for you.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.380

I don't get it.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.639

"Tsunami wipes out

16:19.729 --> 16:22.562
What does any of this
have to do with the murders?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.733
Adam is the one
who's trying to kill us.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.809
I thought Maury Parkman was...

16:27.904 --> 16:29.690
Maury's the weapon.
He's the blunt instrument.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.988
Adam was the visionary.

16:33.076 --> 16:37.365
But with these abilities,
sometimes people tend to think
of themselves as gods.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.905
Did you ever think that,
Nathan?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.622
Adam did.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.326
And he began to talk
about holocausts,

16:44.421 --> 16:48.130
plagues, punishing humanity
in order to save the world.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.085
Sounds a lot like Linderman.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.920
Linderman was Adam's disciple.
Adam was dangerous.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.639
So, we locked him up,
we threw away the key.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.766
Two weeks ago, he escapes.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.636
And now he wants revenge.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.518
It sounds like
you're reaping
what you sow.

17:06.776 --> 17:07.731
Why should I care?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.400
Because of Peter.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.273
Listen, pal,
if you want to talk
about my brother,

17:15.327 --> 17:18.239
you better be very careful
what you say next.

17:18.580 --> 17:23.370
Peter is alive, Nathan.
Your brother's alive.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.883

to help you, Peter. You need
to remember who you are.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.029
I need to find Caitlin.

18:03.124 --> 18:08.619

You can move objects

18:08.713 --> 18:10.669

paint the future.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.672
How do you know about that?

18:12.759 --> 18:16.843
You absorb abilities from
other people. You are
the most powerful of us all.

18:16.930 --> 18:22.846
You're a kind, caring soul.
Selfless. Always thinking
about others.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.145
But now you need to think
about yourself and fly
into the face of danger,

18:27.232 --> 18:29.188
just like your brother.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.395

18:33.738 --> 18:35.945

I can trap you in here
