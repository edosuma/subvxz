WEBVTT

01:37.796 --> 01:41.334
Why? We did everything!

04:04.910 --> 04:06.111
Okay, so check it out.

04:06.144 --> 04:08.514
Are, like,

04:08.547 --> 04:10.182
the best movies
in the last 30 years.

04:10.215 --> 04:14.086
Did you see Kevin costner?
He's a fucking merman!

04:14.119 --> 04:15.988
Did you see the fucking things
behind his ears?

04:16.021 --> 04:17.490
I mean,
that's where the gills were.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.267
You know that, right?
He was, like, half fish.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.494
Is '80s.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.762
Dune.

04:23.795 --> 04:27.566
And also no sting in...
It's a thong.

04:27.599 --> 04:28.901
It's like a space thong.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.970
Space thong?
You guys talking about sting?

04:31.003 --> 04:32.538
You know what sting does?

04:32.571 --> 04:34.282
Are you aware of this?
I don't know if you know this.

04:34.306 --> 04:35.306
He delivers albums.

04:36.942 --> 04:39.078
Where's my fucking record,
grohl?

04:39.111 --> 04:40.713
It's all up here.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.715
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah, it's all up here.

04:42.748 --> 04:47.887
And in there, and in there,
and in there, and in there.

04:48.253 --> 04:49.922
Not so much here,

04:49.955 --> 04:51.557
but I got it, man.
It's all in here.

04:51.590 --> 04:54.293
I think, personally,
that doesn't amount

04:54.326 --> 04:56.195
to a bucket of frozen shit.

04:56.228 --> 04:59.031
I don't know where you get
a bucket of frozen shit,

04:59.064 --> 05:00.566
but that's what it's about!

05:00.599 --> 05:02.935
When you fucking tell me
you got a record,

05:02.968 --> 05:05.070
all I got is a bucket
of frozen shit!

05:05.103 --> 05:07.206
I'm up to my eyeballs in debt...

05:07.239 --> 05:08.607
And I gotta pay

05:08.640 --> 05:11.744
some crazy piece-of-shit
motherfuckers

05:11.777 --> 05:13.746
who I owe so much money to

05:13.779 --> 05:16.081
and I just found out
they may be the ones

05:16.114 --> 05:20.152
who fucking sliced up
that journalist in Turkey.

05:20.185 --> 05:21.587
I just want to give you

05:21.620 --> 05:22.988
the fucking album that you want,

05:23.021 --> 05:24.623
so you can pay off those people

05:24.656 --> 05:27.293
before they turn your nut sack
into a fucking coin purse.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.128
- Relax.
- Oh.

05:29.161 --> 05:31.096
- Did you just say "relax"?
- Yeah.

05:31.129 --> 05:33.198
So here's the thing.

05:33.231 --> 05:37.570
We were thinking...
It's our tenth album, okay?

05:37.603 --> 05:39.772
We can't do the same old shit.

05:39.805 --> 05:41.740
We gotta break
the fucking mold on this one.

05:41.773 --> 05:43.943
Yeah, shill, this record...

05:43.976 --> 05:46.178
It's gotta fucking blow
your fucking dick

05:46.211 --> 05:47.646
right into your fucking mouth.

05:47.679 --> 05:49.782
Blow your own dick
into your mouth?

05:49.815 --> 05:52.084
Yeah, right back up
into your mouth, man.

05:52.117 --> 05:54.219
Right back up into your mouth?

05:54.252 --> 05:56.689
Like it's been there before?

05:56.722 --> 06:00.593
What kind of goal is that?
I don't want that album!

06:00.626 --> 06:02.194
Unless it makes me
a lot of money.

06:02.227 --> 06:05.064
Lot of money?
Blow all the dicks you want.

06:05.097 --> 06:07.099
Look, I can get you a studio,

06:07.132 --> 06:09.168
anywhere you want in town
tomorrow.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.970
We've used all those studios,
okay?

06:11.003 --> 06:12.905
They all sound exactly
the fucking same.

06:12.938 --> 06:14.673
Okay? Let's think
outside the box.

06:14.706 --> 06:16.342
Let's go somewhere
we've never been.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.110
Let's go to a cool place...
Like zeppelin.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.912
When zeppelin
went to the castle...

06:19.945 --> 06:21.947
And there was the devil
and the wizards

06:21.980 --> 06:23.248
and the dragons and shit.

06:23.281 --> 06:24.883
All right.
So, you want me to find you

06:24.916 --> 06:26.085
some wizards and dragons?

06:26.118 --> 06:28.854
Yes! That's what
we should be doing.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.097
You want that? You want that?

06:38.130 --> 06:41.066
Watch as I make this happen.

06:41.099 --> 06:44.837
Holy shit. You fuckers are
not gonna believe it.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.373
I got it. You gotta trust me
and let me do this.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.912
Chilly shills. What can
I do for you, sunshine?

06:53.945 --> 06:55.147
Hey, Barb!

06:55.180 --> 06:58.417
I'm here in my office
with the Foo Fighters!

06:58.450 --> 07:00.419
And they're looking for a place

07:00.452 --> 07:02.688
to record a new album.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.032
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:04.056 --> 07:05.224
Oh.

07:05.257 --> 07:07.259
I do know what you're thinking,

07:07.292 --> 07:10.929
and I have the perfect place.

07:10.962 --> 07:14.867
Foo Fighters, oh, I thought
this time would never come.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.135
Listen, I gotta jump.

07:16.168 --> 07:17.712
But I'll shoot you the address
in the A.M.

07:17.736 --> 07:20.739
This place is to die for.

07:20.772 --> 07:23.142
Prozem high five, up top.

07:23.942 --> 07:26.278
Jeremy is fucking smoking!

07:51.169 --> 07:53.839
Hi, Dave grohl. I'm Barb weems.

07:53.872 --> 07:55.116
- How are you?
- Hi, Barb. How are you?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.284
- I'm such a fan.
- Thank you.

07:56.308 --> 07:57.710
I would love
to get a selfie later,

07:57.743 --> 07:58.777
if that's okay with you.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.779
- Okay.
- Hello, foos! How are you?

08:00.812 --> 08:02.781
It's so nice to meet you.
Barb weems.

08:02.814 --> 08:04.850
So this is the house,
and it is incredible.

08:04.883 --> 08:06.327
I can't wait to show it
to you. Come on.

08:06.351 --> 08:09.221
This place... okay, I know
what you guys are thinking.

08:09.254 --> 08:10.856
It needs a little
sprucey-goosey,

08:10.889 --> 08:11.924
and I agree.

08:11.957 --> 08:13.358
But here's the thing,

08:13.391 --> 08:16.228
this place has some serious
rock and roll pedigree.

08:16.261 --> 08:18.397
I mean, it rolls deep.

08:24.069 --> 08:26.138
A huge music manager
owned this place

08:26.171 --> 08:27.773
in the '70s and '80s

08:27.806 --> 08:30.242
and threw some wild parties.

08:30.275 --> 08:31.977
Come, come.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.414
How sexy
is this stone-finished pool?

08:35.447 --> 08:38.217
I can already see the girls
in their bikinis.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.351
Ooh, it's gonna be fun.

08:39.384 --> 08:41.286
Are you gonna invite me
to your parties?

08:41.319 --> 08:44.423
Look at this
state-of-the-art kitchen.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.926
Do we have any chefs
in the group?

08:47.359 --> 08:48.994
I'm pretty handy on the grill.

08:49.027 --> 08:50.095
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:50.128 --> 08:51.296
Right, guys?

08:51.329 --> 08:54.767
Yeah, if you like
your meat charred and dry.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.235
- Am I right?
- Mm.

08:56.268 --> 08:58.403
Take a look at the other room.

08:58.436 --> 09:00.305
Fuck you.

09:00.338 --> 09:03.008
This is my favorite room
in the house.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.476
These are original
babette fosters.

09:04.509 --> 09:05.553
You know, they stopped
production

09:05.577 --> 09:06.812
on those in the '80s.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.981
I do love a good sconce.

09:09.948 --> 09:11.116
But I don't know,

09:11.149 --> 09:12.885
it definitely has
a weird energy.

09:12.918 --> 09:14.353
You guys feel that?

09:14.386 --> 09:17.322
You guys get
this overwhelming sense

09:17.355 --> 09:20.359
of death and doom?
Or is that just me?

09:20.392 --> 09:21.493
Yeah, like someone's gonna

09:21.526 --> 09:22.561
jump through the window

09:22.594 --> 09:24.029
and start stabbing us
in the eyes!

09:26.064 --> 09:27.208
Okay, I'm gonna be
really straight

09:27.232 --> 09:28.867
with you guys.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.235
There was another band,

09:30.268 --> 09:31.804
and they lived here in the '90s.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.040
They thought the sound
was incredible.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.843
But they never finished
their album.

09:39.177 --> 09:41.313
Creative differences.

09:41.346 --> 09:42.882
I don't know.

09:44.149 --> 09:46.318
Just doesn't really
seem like the right fit.

09:49.521 --> 09:51.357
Whoa. You hear that?

09:56.394 --> 09:58.096
That's fucking rad.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.167
Whoa.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.242
You hear that?

10:19.050 --> 10:21.887
Okay, so if we put
the drums right here,

10:21.920 --> 10:24.022
facing this way...

10:24.055 --> 10:26.291
And then we could put
the guitar stuff right here.

10:26.324 --> 10:29.328
And we could do keyboards,
like, over there.

10:29.361 --> 10:32.264
We can put the mixing desk
in the bedroom up there.

10:33.298 --> 10:35.267
Mm. You know.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.036
We'll take it.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.505
Oh, well, that is music
to my ears, baby.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.307
I'll go draw up
that paperwork right now.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.944
Yay, I knew you would love it.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.046
Okay, you guys, check it out.

10:48.079 --> 10:53.385
The sound of this house
is the sound of album 10.

10:53.418 --> 10:55.487
No songs yet.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.090
But we got the sound.

11:04.996 --> 11:06.899
All right, you guys,
you know the drill.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.233
All gear in the house.

11:08.266 --> 11:10.168
Amps, living room.

11:10.201 --> 11:13.105
Snare drum, shitty job,
living room.

11:13.138 --> 11:14.506
Expensive shit, guitars,

11:14.539 --> 11:16.675
by the amp line
in the living room.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.644
Just fucking hate this shit.

11:28.053 --> 11:30.923
It's like a quarter of an inch
that way. Just...

11:30.956 --> 11:32.124
Just a little...

11:37.262 --> 11:40.099
It's like a hair more.
Just like a tiny...

11:45.070 --> 11:47.573
Now it's too far.
Gotta bring it back.

11:53.078 --> 11:55.047
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.017
- Sweet, huh?
- Whatever, Dave.

12:01.252 --> 12:04.690
Who cares
about a creepy death vibe...

12:04.723 --> 12:06.959
Drum sounds this good?

12:26.478 --> 12:28.948
All right, here's the deal.

12:29.414 --> 12:31.283
Shill's a dick,

12:31.316 --> 12:33.418
- we know this, right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:33.451 --> 12:35.220
But this is
our tenth record, okay?

12:35.253 --> 12:36.555
It's gotta be good.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.256
But we gotta make it fast.

12:38.289 --> 12:42.327
We gotta eat, sleep,
and drink this motherfucker.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.463
So I'm thinking...

12:45.430 --> 12:47.566
We move in to record.

12:48.666 --> 12:51.269
No, no, no. Hear me out.
Hear me out.

12:51.302 --> 12:55.073
Two weeks, tops. Maybe a month.

12:55.106 --> 12:56.541
A month
in this fucking shithole?

12:56.574 --> 12:58.643
And then we can go on
with our normal lives.

12:58.676 --> 13:00.645
You tell my wife.
I'm not telling her.

13:00.678 --> 13:02.781
I'll tell your wife
if you tell my wife.

13:02.814 --> 13:04.116
I'll tell my own wife,

13:04.149 --> 13:05.550
but someone's
gotta talk to my kids.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.652
What am I gonna tell my grandma?

13:07.685 --> 13:12.257
Oh, I can call your grandma.
She loves me.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.292
You remember the hanukkah party?

13:16.461 --> 13:20.366
Come here, grandma.
Sit down. Mm.

13:21.466 --> 13:24.569
Come on, baby, just touch it.
Yeah!

13:24.602 --> 13:26.171
Rami's not gonna know.

13:26.571 --> 13:27.706
Mm!

13:28.239 --> 13:30.275
Bubbe!

13:32.644 --> 13:35.314
Well, I guess that's settled.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.150
I got master bedroom.

13:38.183 --> 13:40.223
- Ooh, I get the guest house.
- I get guest bedroom.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.628
No. No, no, no.

14:23.661 --> 14:25.564
Excuse me.

14:26.631 --> 14:28.400
Excuse me.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.235
Hello.

14:30.568 --> 14:32.604
Hi. Excuse me.

14:33.605 --> 14:37.242
Hey, hey, hey! Yo! Excuse me!

14:44.382 --> 14:45.751
That's weird.

14:58.863 --> 15:00.599
How we looking, man?
We all good?

15:00.632 --> 15:02.234
Yeah, we're all good on our end.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.587
Just need some juice, and we can
start mic-ing up the room.

15:05.703 --> 15:07.506
God damn it!

15:07.539 --> 15:09.508
Dude, who wired this house,

15:09.541 --> 15:11.343
a bunch of fucking
mental patients?

15:11.376 --> 15:13.579
Fuck. Jesus Christ.

15:24.822 --> 15:27.226
No, no, no! Don't touch him!
He's still hot!

15:34.532 --> 15:36.701
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Holy shit!

15:36.734 --> 15:40.472
Wow. He's totally fried.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.147
He's fucking dead!

15:48.680 --> 15:49.881
Oh.

15:49.914 --> 15:51.216
Oh, man.

15:54.619 --> 15:58.390
Krug! Krug! Jägermeister! Krug!

15:58.656 --> 15:59.656
Krug!

16:06.531 --> 16:08.433
Guess we should pack up.

16:08.466 --> 16:10.802
That was a short-lived
experiment.

16:16.474 --> 16:17.543
You know, it's funny...

16:18.276 --> 16:19.911
Hold on, guys.
One second. Check it out.

16:19.944 --> 16:22.280
Krug was really into this place.

16:22.313 --> 16:23.815
You know,
the way the drums sounded.

16:23.848 --> 16:26.585
Dave, seriously,
the guy just got turned

16:26.618 --> 16:27.886
into a fucking bratwurst.

16:27.919 --> 16:30.322
Exactly why we should stay here

16:30.355 --> 16:33.458
and make the record. Okay?

16:33.491 --> 16:35.561
It'll give his life meaning.

16:36.894 --> 16:38.897
You know?
We could dedicate it to krug.

16:40.531 --> 16:43.235
I don't know. I don't know.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.436
I guess we can do

16:44.469 --> 16:45.846
a couple of drum tracks here
in his honor.

16:45.870 --> 16:48.507
Exactly. That's what
I'm talking about right there.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.977
We have to have some fun
with it, you know?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.512
For krug!

16:58.316 --> 17:01.620
People think I look a lot
like Willie Nelson.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.524
You know what, you guys?
I forgot to tell you.

17:05.823 --> 17:07.859
Earlier today,
before krug got zapped,

17:07.892 --> 17:10.895
there was this weird dude
in the yard, creeping around.

17:10.928 --> 17:12.564
What kind of dude?

17:13.498 --> 17:14.866
Some weird guy

17:14.899 --> 17:16.668
who was trimming the hedges
and stuff.

17:16.701 --> 17:20.438
The killer gardener of encino.

17:20.471 --> 17:21.907
Wouldn't be surprised
in this house.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.476
Oh, my god.

17:24.509 --> 17:28.347
What the fuck! Shit!
Dude, you all right, David?

17:30.315 --> 17:31.316
The meat...

17:32.850 --> 17:34.519
It's krug.

17:39.657 --> 17:40.826
Ugh!

17:41.426 --> 17:42.894
You know,
usually I have a clear idea

17:42.927 --> 17:44.796
of what we're going to do...

17:44.829 --> 17:46.931
But ever since we moved
into this house,

17:46.964 --> 17:49.367
my mind is flooded...

17:49.400 --> 17:51.536
Where it's like,
sometimes it's like prince

17:51.569 --> 17:52.904
and then it's like slayer.

17:52.937 --> 17:55.674
Then it's like fucking
Lawrence Welk.

17:58.609 --> 17:59.611
What is it?

18:01.646 --> 18:03.081
You guys hear that?

18:03.114 --> 18:04.582
Probably some raccoon,

18:04.615 --> 18:06.460
'cause I heard them
eating the trash last night.

18:06.484 --> 18:08.820
Probably that creeper dude!

18:08.853 --> 18:10.689
He better not be filming this!

18:54.499 --> 18:55.767
- Hey, neighbor!
- Argh!

18:57.535 --> 18:59.137
God!

18:59.170 --> 19:00.638
You should have seen your face!

19:00.671 --> 19:03.007
Or should I say "feces"?

19:03.040 --> 19:03.975
I mean, you looked like

19:04.008 --> 19:05.610
- you crapped your pants.
- Yep.

19:05.643 --> 19:07.112
I'm Samantha.
I live right next door.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.748
I just wanted
to introduce myself...

19:09.781 --> 19:11.516
In case you boys
needed anything.

19:11.549 --> 19:14.453
A cup of sugar. Back-up singer.

19:15.486 --> 19:20.558
I got another confession to make.

19:23.628 --> 19:27.132
Were you born to resist.

19:27.165 --> 19:30.369
Or be abused?

19:31.702 --> 19:33.104
Is someone getting the best.

19:33.137 --> 19:39.611
The best, the best
the best of you?

19:44.182 --> 19:46.151
Oh. Thank you.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.494
We'll let you know
about that one.

19:47.518 --> 19:49.788
Okay. I'm around.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.823
Let me apologize in advance

19:51.856 --> 19:54.025
for all the rock
we're about to make.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.927
Oh, I can't hear anything

19:55.960 --> 19:57.729
over my Portuguese
singing bowls.

19:57.762 --> 20:02.066
Ooh, those vibrations elevate
the frequency of the psyche.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.435
Play your cards right,

20:03.468 --> 20:05.937
maybe you will get
a sound bath later.

20:05.970 --> 20:10.175
Okay, rami-o.
Let's keep it moving.

20:11.509 --> 20:14.479
Namaste.

20:14.512 --> 20:16.056
Hey, is there some
sort of gardener dude

20:16.080 --> 20:17.749
that takes care
of the property...

20:17.782 --> 20:19.484
Trimming hedges and stuff?

20:19.517 --> 20:22.220
No, Dave. Nobody lives here.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.990
This house has been empty
for years.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.165
Okay, check it out.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.501
I got a couple new riff ideas
I've been working on.

20:36.534 --> 20:37.802
I'm gonna lay them on you.

20:37.835 --> 20:40.572
Riff number one.
Sounds like this.

20:48.012 --> 20:51.049
All my life?

20:53.017 --> 20:54.119
Shit.

20:55.286 --> 20:57.722
Okay, no, no, no.
Hold on. I got one more.

21:03.261 --> 21:06.731
Dude, wait, wait, wait.
That's a great fucking song.

21:06.764 --> 21:07.799
Everlong,

21:07.832 --> 21:09.534
and you wrote it
about 20 years ago.

21:11.936 --> 21:14.172
What? The well's run dry.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.176
I've written
all my songs already.

21:18.209 --> 21:22.247
Ugh. All I have
are these random snippets

21:22.280 --> 21:25.083
of fossilized mtv bullshit
in my head.

21:25.116 --> 21:28.520
Dude, dude. Look here.

21:29.287 --> 21:31.990
Have you ever tried meditating?

21:37.595 --> 21:40.565
Fuck meditating
in the ass, rami!

21:40.598 --> 21:43.101
All right, I'm gonna step out
for a minute, guys.

21:43.134 --> 21:45.670
Why don't we give Dave
a little space here?

21:59.116 --> 22:01.152
Something will come.

22:22.173 --> 22:25.310
Ugh! Son of a fucking bitch!

22:42.159 --> 22:47.832
I've been alone
with you inside my mind.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.902
In my dreams

22:50.935 --> 22:55.840
I've kissed your lips
a thousand times.

22:56.307 --> 23:02.047
I sometimes see you pass
outside my door.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.315
Hello...

23:04.348 --> 23:06.818
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Dave.

23:06.851 --> 23:08.019
Lionel!

23:08.052 --> 23:10.054
We all have writer's block,
you know?

23:10.087 --> 23:11.289
Mm-hmm.

23:12.423 --> 23:15.059
But that's my fucking song.

23:15.092 --> 23:16.628
- That's my fucking song!
- Mm-hmm.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.263
You understand what I'm saying?

23:18.963 --> 23:22.400
I like that song.
No, no, no. I love that song!

23:22.433 --> 23:23.644
That's one of my favorite songs.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.269
- I love singing that song.
- Mm-hmm.

23:25.302 --> 23:27.372
Love that song!

23:29.306 --> 23:30.809
Get your own song!

23:31.308 --> 23:32.677
Nerd.

23:52.963 --> 23:56.835
Ugh. Taylor,
sleep in your own bed.

23:58.969 --> 24:00.171
Taylor?

24:05.376 --> 24:06.878
You...

24:07.445 --> 24:08.947
Are not...

24:10.114 --> 24:11.315
The first!

24:11.348 --> 24:13.852
Krug! Oh, my god, I'm so sorry!

24:15.352 --> 24:17.221
They are watching!

24:19.156 --> 24:20.859
No, krug!

24:43.814 --> 24:45.349
What the fuck!

24:49.386 --> 24:52.790
What the fuck!

24:52.823 --> 24:54.826
Oh, my god!

25:29.160 --> 25:31.496
Fuck this. I'm starving.

25:37.334 --> 25:38.369
Yeah, I got, like,

25:38.402 --> 25:40.338
three or four
chicken parms here?

26:14.338 --> 26:18.209
Whoa. You're Dave grohl! What?

26:21.045 --> 26:23.915
Yeah, I get that all the time.

26:23.948 --> 26:26.384
Uh, right. Yeah.
I heard about this.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.019
You're, like, incognito, right?

26:28.052 --> 26:30.955
No, see, I'm not Dave grohl.

26:30.988 --> 26:33.457
Dave grohl
can actually write music.

26:33.490 --> 26:36.294
Don't. I'm seriously a huge fan.

26:36.327 --> 26:39.130
You're, like, my second
favorite band after coldplay.

26:44.168 --> 26:46.838
You know,
I asked for extra ranch.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.340
Oh, yeah, and I'll go run back,

26:49.373 --> 26:50.541
get some for you.

26:50.574 --> 26:52.977
Yeah, 'cause it'll only take
a few minutes.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.846
You know, I'm in a band, yeah.

26:54.879 --> 26:57.014
But, yeah, I'll run back
and get some ranch

26:57.047 --> 27:00.151
and drop it off with my demo,
if that's cool.

27:00.184 --> 27:02.921
I'll just use the marinara.

27:04.588 --> 27:05.890
Hey, what's up?

27:05.923 --> 27:08.125
This is Bob
from playthisriff.Com

27:08.158 --> 27:10.194
and you've come here today

27:10.227 --> 27:12.463
because you have
song-writing constipation.

27:12.496 --> 27:15.433
So, when I have
song-writing constipation

27:15.466 --> 27:18.502
and I want a violent,
greasy dose of the hits,

27:18.535 --> 27:20.304
I turn to classic
riff structure,

27:20.337 --> 27:21.539
like this. Check it out.

27:23.674 --> 27:24.942
Part b.

27:28.545 --> 27:29.914
Part c.

27:36.186 --> 27:39.323
Am I the only one who cares
about the drought around here?

30:44.108 --> 30:46.577
Oh, fuck.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.584
Who kills a fucking raccoon?

30:56.854 --> 30:58.456
Ugh.

31:09.399 --> 31:11.436
He's real.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.310
Dave...

31:54.611 --> 31:55.646
Whoa.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.412
"Dream widow." No way.

33:09.753 --> 33:11.923
This stuff's incredible.

33:16.893 --> 33:18.296
Fuck, yeah.

33:46.890 --> 33:51.395
It's the sound.
It's this fucking sound.

33:51.428 --> 33:54.632
Yes! Fuck, yes!

33:55.065 --> 33:56.834
Fuck!

33:56.867 --> 33:58.636
It's fucking incredible!

34:05.008 --> 34:08.545
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Don't stop.

34:08.578 --> 34:10.448
There's gotta be more.

34:11.415 --> 34:14.986
Fuck, there's gotta be more.
Please, god.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.789
Please, please, please.

34:21.692 --> 34:22.960
Fuck!

34:23.427 --> 34:27.632
No. Shit! God damn it!

34:28.098 --> 34:30.835
God, it was perfect!

35:09.906 --> 35:11.876
Finish it and it begins.

35:15.445 --> 35:17.581
Finish it. End it.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.986
Finish it and it begins.

35:30.427 --> 35:32.029
Fuck.

35:32.929 --> 35:34.365
Finish it.

36:07.063 --> 36:08.366
What are you doing?

36:08.832 --> 36:11.035
There's a dead raccoon in there.

36:19.009 --> 36:20.778
Dick.

37:23.640 --> 37:27.044
- Wow.
- Awesome, man.

37:28.812 --> 37:31.782
Fuck. It's like you were
musically constipated

37:31.815 --> 37:32.850
and now you just took

37:32.883 --> 37:34.718
the biggest musical shit on us.

37:34.751 --> 37:36.620
- Fucking awesome!
- I know, right?

37:36.653 --> 37:37.688
I'm still working on it.

37:37.721 --> 37:38.998
It's like a hundred ideas
in my head

37:39.022 --> 37:40.791
just fighting to get out.

37:40.824 --> 37:43.894
Could be a double,
maybe a triple album.

37:43.927 --> 37:45.896
- I don't know.
- Let's get to work.

37:45.929 --> 37:46.997
Fuck you, Nate.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.766
Don't tell me what to do,
asshole.

37:49.099 --> 37:50.634
Told you it would come, man.

37:54.671 --> 37:56.106
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

38:03.680 --> 38:05.215
What key is this in?

38:09.219 --> 38:11.288
I sharp.

38:11.321 --> 38:13.557
You found a new musical note?

38:13.590 --> 38:15.259
Hell motherfucking yes, I did.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.995
Came to me last night.
Just dropped in my head.

38:18.028 --> 38:19.730
Like, boom!

38:20.697 --> 38:22.199
You're welcome, music.

38:22.232 --> 38:25.269
So, the I sharp,
that's basically an e flat,

38:25.302 --> 38:27.104
only like an octave up?

38:27.137 --> 38:30.908
It's not an e, it's an I.

38:35.779 --> 38:37.080
If you guys could just, like,

38:37.113 --> 38:38.982
open up your hearts and minds,

38:39.015 --> 38:40.918
you know, maybe you'd be able
to hear it.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.953
So, what happened to...

38:42.986 --> 38:45.856
H, I, j, k?

38:45.889 --> 38:51.061
G, h I don't give a fuck!

38:51.094 --> 38:53.864
It's I sharp, okay, you guys?

38:53.897 --> 38:55.766
That's the root note
of the song.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.138
Yes, yes,
you're getting warmer. Yes.

39:01.738 --> 39:04.675
Pat, you're cold,
like north pole, Antarctica.

39:04.708 --> 39:05.876
Not even close.

39:05.909 --> 39:08.712
I think I'm feeling something.

39:12.082 --> 39:14.618
Oh, god. Who the fuck!

39:17.187 --> 39:19.323
Hello?

39:19.356 --> 39:21.992
Oh. Any hungry rock stars
in there?

39:22.025 --> 39:23.894
Brought some num-nummy treats.

39:23.927 --> 39:27.097
Oh, god, I detest that woman.
Ugh!

39:30.934 --> 39:33.170
- Lemon bar?
- Go away!

39:33.203 --> 39:36.206
Dude, lighten up. She's hot.

39:36.239 --> 39:39.009
- Hello, beautiful. What's up?
- Hey.

39:39.042 --> 39:43.113
Some fresh-baked lemon bars
for my favorite band.

39:43.146 --> 39:44.314
It's my grandma's recipe,

39:44.347 --> 39:46.216
but I added
my own little twist to it.

39:46.249 --> 39:48.285
- Ooh, is that cocaine?
- Mm-hmm.

39:48.318 --> 39:49.886
Mm-hmm.
Not a good time right now

39:49.919 --> 39:52.156
'cause we're working
on music, okay?

39:53.390 --> 39:57.194
How you feeling?
Everything okay?

39:57.227 --> 39:59.296
Never better.

40:02.799 --> 40:03.834
I'll get rid of her.

40:03.867 --> 40:05.636
Get her the fuck out of here!

40:05.669 --> 40:09.072
Hey. Sorry,
he gets really intense

40:09.105 --> 40:10.173
when we're recording.

40:10.206 --> 40:11.942
I need to talk to you, alone.

40:11.975 --> 40:13.877
Ooh, I'd like
to get you alone, too.

40:13.910 --> 40:17.715
No, it's about this house.
There's something evil.

40:20.083 --> 40:23.253
I should go.
Dave seems stressed.

40:24.254 --> 40:27.024
Hey, how about
that sound bath later?

40:29.359 --> 40:33.230
- What the fuck, cock-blocker!
- Fuck you, rami!

40:54.284 --> 40:57.688
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.189
Uh...

40:59.222 --> 41:03.427
Taylor, take it from the boom-
bah-boom-bah-boom-bah part.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.961
There's like eight thousand
boom-bahs.

41:04.994 --> 41:06.405
- Which one do you mean?
- You know which one.

41:06.429 --> 41:08.065
You know we're coming in at,
like,

41:08.098 --> 41:09.366
23 minutes and counting, right?

41:09.399 --> 41:13.370
So what? So maybe we have
a song that has no end.

41:13.403 --> 41:16.039
So, we're not close.

41:16.072 --> 41:17.349
I mean, to me it just feels like

41:17.373 --> 41:20.077
there's something missing,
you know?

41:20.110 --> 41:21.878
Uh, you know, guys,
let's just run through

41:21.911 --> 41:23.013
what we've got.

41:23.046 --> 41:24.381
I'm sure you'll get it.

41:24.414 --> 41:27.818
Thanks, Chris.
You fucking asshole!

41:29.018 --> 41:30.120
Go!

41:31.921 --> 41:33.490
One, two, three, four.

42:11.528 --> 42:13.230
- Nate!
- What?

42:13.263 --> 42:16.133
I got an idea, okay?
Downstairs, now. Let's go.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.267
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

42:17.300 --> 42:18.335
Peter.

42:18.368 --> 42:19.402
Yo, what up, d?

42:19.435 --> 42:21.305
I got an idea. Come downstairs.

42:32.549 --> 42:35.819
- Are those mine?
- Oh, yeah. I borrowed them.

42:37.554 --> 42:40.424
- Have you seen pat?
- No idea.

42:41.958 --> 42:43.327
Hey, pat!

42:44.227 --> 42:46.797
In here.

42:52.335 --> 42:54.204
What are you doing in here?

42:56.406 --> 42:58.975
Well, this is
the most comfortable place

42:59.008 --> 43:00.443
I could find.

43:00.476 --> 43:01.912
And there's snacks.

43:02.212 --> 43:03.280
Oh.

43:09.419 --> 43:12.389
- Voila!
- You made this?

43:12.422 --> 43:14.024
Yeah. It's like the only thing

43:14.057 --> 43:15.926
that'll get this song
out of my head, you know?

43:15.959 --> 43:19.229
- And that's the song?
- Exactly.

43:19.262 --> 43:22.332
So, each one
of these little nails

43:22.365 --> 43:23.567
is one of us.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.205
The yarn represents
the vibrations of sound

43:28.238 --> 43:29.606
that our music makes,

43:29.639 --> 43:32.509
connecting all of us
in an unending form.

43:32.542 --> 43:34.411
It's like the universe...

43:34.444 --> 43:36.479
You know, there's
no beginnings, no end.

43:37.614 --> 43:38.882
Great, Dave.

43:38.915 --> 43:40.317
Can we pick this up
in the morning?

43:40.350 --> 43:42.328
Well, I kind of had these
new ideas, and I was hoping...

43:42.352 --> 43:44.463
Maybe we could put them down
tonight so I don't forget them.

43:44.487 --> 43:48.358
No, man, I gotta go to sleep.
I'm tired.

43:51.027 --> 43:52.196
What did you just say?

43:52.562 --> 43:56.499
Come on,
I don't even have a bedroom.

43:56.532 --> 44:00.470
I never get any sleep.
Let's just do this tomorrow.

44:00.503 --> 44:03.373
Before that. Small word.

44:03.406 --> 44:06.042
Begins with an n,
ends with an o.

44:06.075 --> 44:07.444
Nothing in between.

44:12.048 --> 44:15.385
No. I said no.

44:18.922 --> 44:20.457
No?

44:22.659 --> 44:27.264
Did you just say no...
To Dave grohl?

44:35.338 --> 44:37.974
I'm a fucking rock star! Okay?

44:38.007 --> 44:40.210
I get whatever I want,
whenever I want!

44:40.243 --> 44:43.313
The best parking wherever I go
for eternity!

44:43.346 --> 44:45.081
Them's the rules!

44:48.384 --> 44:49.384
Come on, come on.

44:50.353 --> 44:53.223
Talk to Jimmy page
if you don't like it.

44:53.256 --> 44:55.492
Dude, what the fuck?

44:55.525 --> 44:59.996
I'll do it if you stop being
such a fucking dick!

45:00.029 --> 45:02.266
Thank you.
Can we just do this, please?

45:05.101 --> 45:07.671
- One, two, three...
- No, no, hey, hey!

45:08.438 --> 45:10.173
Is there any way
you could count it like:

45:10.206 --> 45:12.208
Five, six, seven, eight!

45:12.241 --> 45:16.647
Like a fucking dancer
counting in a dance?

45:19.382 --> 45:21.351
That's fine. Cool.

45:21.384 --> 45:23.387
Five, six, seven, eight!

45:23.720 --> 45:27.257
Dude has gone fucking crazy!

45:27.290 --> 45:29.326
Like, ass-flapping,
dick-slapping,

45:29.359 --> 45:31.128
crazy.

45:31.594 --> 45:35.165
Listen. Come on, guys,
let's just buckle down,

45:35.198 --> 45:36.499
give him what he wants,

45:36.532 --> 45:38.335
and we can get the fuck
out of here.

45:38.368 --> 45:40.370
- Yeah, but what does he want?
- Hey, guys!

45:40.403 --> 45:42.138
Ixnay on the aveday.

45:42.171 --> 45:43.473
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

45:43.506 --> 45:46.643
- What's happening?
- What's up?

45:46.676 --> 45:51.081
I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.

45:52.081 --> 45:54.384
I'm sorry
for being such a giant, red,

45:54.417 --> 45:57.721
puckered orangutan's asshole
last night.

45:57.754 --> 46:00.657
This album means
the world to me, okay?

46:00.690 --> 46:03.493
And I think I just
let it take over,

46:03.526 --> 46:05.729
and I treated you like shit...

46:05.762 --> 46:07.731
And I'm really sorry.

46:09.165 --> 46:11.601
Which one of you gave Dave
a Hummer?

46:11.634 --> 46:15.205
- Rami.
- Rami.

46:16.139 --> 46:18.375
Listen, we're so close, okay?

46:18.408 --> 46:21.344
If we could just finish
this song tonight,

46:21.377 --> 46:22.479
we'll be out by Sunday.

46:22.512 --> 46:24.414
Promise.

46:24.447 --> 46:26.616
Stick with me. We can do this.

46:28.317 --> 46:29.753
The song is pretty epic, dude.

46:29.786 --> 46:32.222
Right? I do think it should
have an ending, by the way.

46:32.255 --> 46:34.557
- Thank god.
- Okay.

46:34.590 --> 46:37.761
So I have this idea, right?

46:37.794 --> 46:39.729
It starts with Nate.

46:39.762 --> 46:43.566
The root, the foundation,
the bass.

46:43.599 --> 46:44.768
Nate goes...

46:50.673 --> 46:52.184
Chris, rami,
you come in like warships,

46:52.208 --> 46:53.309
banging off each other.

46:58.214 --> 46:59.282
Then, rami, you're all...

47:04.520 --> 47:07.524
Pat, Taylor, you come in
like riders of the apocalypse.

47:08.724 --> 47:10.260
- Whack!
- Whoa!

47:10.293 --> 47:11.561
Whack!

47:11.594 --> 47:12.629
- Whack!
- Yeah!

47:24.807 --> 47:26.376
Bam!

47:26.409 --> 47:29.746
Like that!
You know what I'm saying?

47:29.779 --> 47:32.382
We got this. Right?

47:32.415 --> 47:34.718
- Yeah, we can do this.
- Pearl jam high five.

47:35.251 --> 47:38.088
Pearl jam high five.

47:38.121 --> 47:39.722
Break! We're still alive.

47:39.755 --> 47:41.358
Come on, let's go!

50:06.435 --> 50:08.304
You sure you want us to leave?

50:08.337 --> 50:09.772
I think we're all good.

50:09.805 --> 50:12.375
All right. Well, if you track
anything this weekend,

50:12.408 --> 50:15.712
just pop it onto a drive,
and we'll mix it on Monday.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.448
Let's get out of here.

50:54.717 --> 50:57.287
How's it going, bro?
How's it sounding?

50:58.321 --> 51:00.456
It's good. I'm just
cleaning up some tracks.

51:00.489 --> 51:02.525
Cool, man. I haven't seen you
eat anything all day.

51:02.558 --> 51:03.593
Are you hungry?

51:03.626 --> 51:05.762
How about
some grill action, dude?

51:07.530 --> 51:10.700
No. I ordered
a shit-ton of steaks earlier.

51:10.733 --> 51:12.044
The guy should be here
any minute.

51:12.068 --> 51:14.704
Cool, man. I'll let you know
when he's here.

51:34.924 --> 51:36.693
All right.

51:42.598 --> 51:45.435
"Oh, Dave, I forgot you were
staying here!"

51:45.468 --> 51:48.738
"Oh, well,
here's your food and, uh..."

51:48.771 --> 51:51.608
"Yeah, I brought you that cd
I was talking about."

51:52.508 --> 51:53.810
Oh, he's not gonna buy that.

51:54.944 --> 51:57.747
Come on!

51:57.780 --> 51:59.482
You are a worthy
and talented musician.

51:59.515 --> 52:03.353
I'm a worthy
and talented musician!

52:25.875 --> 52:27.477
"Hey, Dave. Brought you

52:27.510 --> 52:29.679
a bunch of extra ranch
this time, man.

52:29.712 --> 52:33.583
"Oh, this? It's my demo
that I told you about. Yeah."

52:39.822 --> 52:41.358
Dave?

52:47.730 --> 52:50.734
Hello? Dave?

52:53.102 --> 52:54.937
Oh, hey, sorry it took so long.

52:54.970 --> 52:56.047
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure

52:56.071 --> 52:57.607
they got your order right.

52:58.741 --> 53:01.077
It's all back here. I got...

53:03.012 --> 53:04.614
Dave!

53:08.184 --> 53:10.553
What the hell?

53:55.231 --> 53:57.634
Hey, did that delivery guy
ever show up?

53:58.901 --> 54:01.938
Yeah, I don't know.
Gonna take a look.

54:06.675 --> 54:09.479
Looks like he just
dropped the bags and left.

54:09.512 --> 54:11.581
You know, I think
I kind of freaked him out.

54:11.614 --> 54:13.850
He wanted to drop a demo on me.

54:13.883 --> 54:15.852
- Mm.
- I wasn't really in the mood.

54:15.885 --> 54:16.920
Mm.

54:22.091 --> 54:24.861
What is it?
Think he's still out there?

54:38.674 --> 54:41.711
You can never have enough ranch.

54:47.650 --> 54:49.686
Okay, so what's left?

54:50.819 --> 54:51.988
So...

54:53.856 --> 54:56.159
Drum tracks tomorrow...

54:57.660 --> 54:58.995
And then
we just gotta figure out

54:59.028 --> 55:00.596
how to end this thing.

55:00.629 --> 55:04.066
We're not actually making
a 38-minute-long song, right?

55:04.099 --> 55:06.669
- No.
- Okay, cool.

55:06.702 --> 55:08.638
It's gonna be
fucking longer than that.

55:08.671 --> 55:09.906
- What?
- Huh?

55:09.939 --> 55:12.608
- What?
- It's gonna be epic, man!

55:12.641 --> 55:16.579
It's gonna be
like 2112 times 2112.

55:27.256 --> 55:28.925
What?

55:28.958 --> 55:30.059
Hey, buddy, why don't you

55:30.092 --> 55:31.961
let me take the grill
tomorrow night?

55:31.994 --> 55:34.564
It seems like you got a lot
on your mind.

55:35.998 --> 55:37.600
Okay.

55:37.633 --> 55:40.570
Just leave mine raw, dude.

55:42.004 --> 55:44.574
It's so fucking juicy.

55:49.311 --> 55:51.747
Hey, guys, it's Barb!

55:51.780 --> 55:53.683
I'm just checking in

55:53.716 --> 55:56.553
to see how everything is going.

55:57.086 --> 55:59.622
Oh, my god. They are barbarians.

56:08.297 --> 56:10.833
Oh, my goodness,
it's on the ceiling.

56:10.866 --> 56:12.835
Okay, how do they even do that?

56:14.036 --> 56:15.605
Ugh.

56:24.747 --> 56:27.316
Oh, my god.

56:27.349 --> 56:30.219
What did you do?

56:34.023 --> 56:36.726
- Hey, Barb.
- Pat!

56:36.759 --> 56:39.162
I thought you were dead.

56:39.962 --> 56:42.065
Wow. Uh...

56:42.297 --> 56:43.933
How is everything going?

56:43.966 --> 56:47.337
Is, uh, is Dave done
with his big concept album?

56:48.037 --> 56:50.206
- He told you about that?
- Oh, yeah.

56:50.239 --> 56:51.807
I guess he's been talking
to shill.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.109
They seemed pretty excited.

56:53.142 --> 56:56.812
- Where is everyone?
- Upstairs, sleeping.

56:56.845 --> 56:59.181
Oh. I used to sleep here,

56:59.214 --> 57:01.384
but not with all this crap
on it.

57:02.217 --> 57:03.719
A lemon bar?

57:03.752 --> 57:06.088
No, thank you.
I don't eat sugar or gluten.

57:06.121 --> 57:09.091
Or any citrus fruits,
or dairy, or corn.

57:09.124 --> 57:11.094
It's terrible for your gut.

57:11.360 --> 57:12.695
Mm.

57:12.728 --> 57:14.005
You know,
they actually look homemade.

57:14.029 --> 57:15.765
Is there a baker in the band?

57:15.798 --> 57:18.067
Mm-mm. Lady next door?

57:18.734 --> 57:20.302
Samantha?

57:20.335 --> 57:22.939
That woman is a train wreck.
I've known her for years.

57:27.810 --> 57:31.247
- "Sacrifice"?
- What did you just say?

57:31.947 --> 57:34.283
I did, uh... me... huh?

57:34.316 --> 57:37.286
Um, I don't know. Nothing.

57:40.222 --> 57:43.259
Hey, Barb.
What's up? You made it.

57:43.292 --> 57:45.828
David, how goes it?
Is the album almost done?

57:46.228 --> 57:48.064
Yeah, it's so good.

57:48.097 --> 57:49.765
- Yeah, it's killer.
- Oh.

57:49.798 --> 57:51.934
Yeah, we're actually
wrapping up tonight.

57:51.967 --> 57:53.369
Oh, great.

57:53.402 --> 57:55.213
So I should make arrangements
accordingly then.

57:55.237 --> 57:56.873
I'm gonna go freshen up.

57:57.372 --> 57:59.942
Hmm, interesting guy.

58:00.776 --> 58:02.378
He's the best.

58:32.841 --> 58:35.812
All right. Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

58:36.845 --> 58:38.381
Something's not right.

58:40.215 --> 58:41.751
It's the ending.

58:42.184 --> 58:44.087
You know, there has to be more.

58:45.888 --> 58:49.859
You know,
if we just stopped recording,

58:49.892 --> 58:51.360
it would be over!

58:51.393 --> 58:54.964
Yup. A tight 44 fucking minutes.

58:54.997 --> 58:58.267
And then ending in a nice
slow fade '70s style.

58:58.300 --> 59:00.970
'Cause, dude, I have blisters
on my fucking blisters.

59:01.003 --> 59:02.972
My hands are killing me, dude.

59:03.005 --> 59:04.140
Yeah, we've been looking

59:04.173 --> 59:06.509
for this mythical
fucking ending all day.

59:07.209 --> 59:10.246
You know what,
I'm fucking out of here.

59:10.579 --> 59:13.015
Whoa!

59:14.049 --> 59:16.352
Frigging dick sandwich!

59:16.385 --> 59:18.955
Fuck you, shifty!

59:24.326 --> 59:28.063
What the fuck?
Forty-minute fucking song.

59:28.096 --> 59:31.500
"Look at me. I'm Dave grohl,
the big fucking genius.

59:31.533 --> 59:34.303
"I don't have any fucking rules."

59:34.336 --> 59:37.173
"I write songs
with no fucking endings."

59:37.206 --> 59:40.209
"Forty minutes long."

59:41.243 --> 59:43.145
He can't even cook
a piece of meat

59:43.178 --> 59:45.047
to save his life.

59:54.957 --> 59:57.993
Hey, shifty,
need a beer or anything?

59:58.026 --> 1:00:00.863
Yeah, to shove up
Dave's fucking ass!

1:00:58.687 --> 1:01:00.356
Fucking blisters, man.

1:01:00.389 --> 1:01:03.158
I should start wearing
those stupid fucking gloves.

1:01:03.191 --> 1:01:04.927
Fuck this, man. I'm outta here.

1:01:05.460 --> 1:01:06.595
Just hang out.

1:01:06.628 --> 1:01:08.464
Chris just had
to blow off some steam.

1:01:08.497 --> 1:01:11.634
We should get Dave
one of those magnet bracelets.

1:01:11.667 --> 1:01:13.202
His energy's way off.

1:01:22.411 --> 1:01:24.647
What the fuck is that?

1:01:25.213 --> 1:01:27.216
Oh! See?
Fucking horrific, isn't it?

1:01:28.517 --> 1:01:29.618
Who the fuck is that?

1:01:29.651 --> 1:01:31.153
And where the fuck is his head?

1:01:31.186 --> 1:01:33.322
It's the delivery guy.
Look at all this ranch.

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:40.229
Holy shit!

1:01:41.129 --> 1:01:42.197
Holy shit!

1:01:43.699 --> 1:01:46.068
That's the guy that delivered
all the food earlier.

1:01:50.605 --> 1:01:52.942
Don't touch that.
No, no, no. Ugh.

1:01:52.975 --> 1:01:54.410
Dave, Dave, don't... ugh!

1:01:58.714 --> 1:02:01.350
"Bone structure."

1:02:01.383 --> 1:02:03.953
He wanted me to hear this.

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:07.189
How long has this guy been here?

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:14.931
I'm picking up
some energy beacons.

1:02:15.430 --> 1:02:19.435
He transitioned
around 28 hours ago.

1:02:20.202 --> 1:02:22.104
Where the fuck
did you learn that?

1:02:22.137 --> 1:02:23.439
Pasadena.

1:02:23.472 --> 1:02:25.541
First, krug gets
electrocuted, and now this?

1:02:25.574 --> 1:02:28.143
Fuck this shit.
I'm calling the cops.

1:02:28.176 --> 1:02:30.446
- No, no, no. No cops!
- Fuck this shit.

1:02:30.479 --> 1:02:32.281
No fucking cops!

1:02:33.782 --> 1:02:36.352
What the fuck!

1:02:36.385 --> 1:02:39.288
Maybe Dave's right. We should
call shill. I mean, look at...

1:02:39.321 --> 1:02:41.724
If this gets out,
it's gonna be bad.

1:02:41.757 --> 1:02:43.692
Listen, no cops, no shill.

1:02:43.725 --> 1:02:46.095
Okay, we cannot afford
that intrusion right now.

1:02:46.128 --> 1:02:48.364
Guy looks like a fucking
salami sandwich up there.

1:02:48.397 --> 1:02:50.632
- What the fuck?
- I understand.

1:02:50.665 --> 1:02:53.435
This is bad. And this is sad.

1:02:53.468 --> 1:02:55.404
But if we call the cops
right now...

1:02:55.437 --> 1:02:57.506
They're gonna turn this place
into a crime scene

1:02:57.539 --> 1:03:01.110
and you can kiss that awesome
drum sound goodbye forever.

1:03:02.177 --> 1:03:05.681
- So, we just keep on going?
- Yes! One more day.

1:03:05.714 --> 1:03:07.616
We finish this thing out,

1:03:07.649 --> 1:03:09.651
okay, and then we can
call everybody.

1:03:09.684 --> 1:03:12.688
We can call the FBI, CSI, NCIS.

1:03:12.721 --> 1:03:15.758
We'll call them all.
And then we'll give, uh...

1:03:15.791 --> 1:03:19.094
Darren sandelbaum,
from bone structure,

1:03:19.127 --> 1:03:20.362
a proper burial.

1:03:20.395 --> 1:03:23.132
Caskets, flowers,
the whole nine.

1:03:23.165 --> 1:03:24.767
We can even tweet a link

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.302
to the bone structure
on our insta-thing.

1:03:27.335 --> 1:03:29.705
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

1:03:30.539 --> 1:03:33.042
This is what Darren
would have wanted.

1:03:33.075 --> 1:03:34.176
And he might have wanted

1:03:34.209 --> 1:03:35.611
- to keep his fucking head.
- Yeah.

1:03:35.644 --> 1:03:38.047
He didn't want
to fuck up our record!

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.182
He loved this band.

1:03:40.215 --> 1:03:43.085
He died for our band.

1:03:43.118 --> 1:03:45.654
Let's do this, you guys. Okay?

1:03:45.687 --> 1:03:48.457
Do it for Darren sandelbaum.

1:03:49.291 --> 1:03:51.060
You guys in?

1:03:53.462 --> 1:03:54.663
You in?

1:03:55.397 --> 1:03:58.067
- Well...
- Are you guys in?

1:03:59.501 --> 1:04:02.038
Come on, let's get to work.

1:04:05.407 --> 1:04:08.243
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna need
everybody's cell phones

1:04:08.276 --> 1:04:10.112
and the keys to the Van.

1:04:10.145 --> 1:04:13.049
'Cause no one's going anywhere
until we finish this song.

1:04:18.153 --> 1:04:19.755
Thank you.

1:04:20.555 --> 1:04:23.158
Thank you. Thank you.

1:04:23.191 --> 1:04:24.726
Thank you.

1:04:24.759 --> 1:04:26.228
I don't have a phone anymore.

1:04:26.261 --> 1:04:27.563
Thank you.

1:05:00.495 --> 1:05:03.632
It all comes back
to the I sharp. Got it?

1:05:04.633 --> 1:05:06.869
Yeah, we got it. Totally got it.

1:05:07.736 --> 1:05:10.472
Let's just track the song
so we can go home.

1:05:10.505 --> 1:05:12.374
I'm tired.
My kids think I'm dead.

1:05:12.407 --> 1:05:15.844
And where's shifty?
He should be here.

1:05:15.877 --> 1:05:19.648
He was out by the grill.
He's gone.

1:05:20.215 --> 1:05:22.851
Okay, let's just do this
one more time.

1:05:22.884 --> 1:05:26.321
- Count us in.
- Five, six, seven, eight...

1:05:26.354 --> 1:05:28.657
Actually, no.
You know what, this time...

1:05:28.690 --> 1:05:31.727
Odd numbers only
in this section.

1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:34.396
One, three, five, seven. Hit it.

1:05:37.399 --> 1:05:39.401
Okay.

1:05:39.434 --> 1:05:41.837
One, three, five, seven.

1:06:09.464 --> 1:06:12.301
He's still eating. Let's go.

1:06:15.670 --> 1:06:17.573
He came out of here.

1:06:18.373 --> 1:06:20.776
- I was back here eating chips.
- Big surprise.

1:06:20.809 --> 1:06:22.711
Then I found this.

1:06:22.744 --> 1:06:26.482
The neighbor lady that left
the lemon bars left this.

1:06:27.983 --> 1:06:30.819
It's a code!
She's been trying to warn us!

1:06:30.852 --> 1:06:32.554
You just want
to fucking bang her, rami.

1:06:32.587 --> 1:06:34.623
Yes, I want to bang her.

1:06:34.656 --> 1:06:36.792
But I also want
to not get decapitated.

1:06:36.825 --> 1:06:38.493
Let's go ask her.

1:06:38.526 --> 1:06:39.926
She's always by the fence.
Let's go.

1:06:42.264 --> 1:06:43.665
That's you?

1:06:43.698 --> 1:06:45.667
I thought we had an infestation

1:06:45.700 --> 1:06:46.902
of yellow warblers.

1:06:46.935 --> 1:06:49.471
That was the wood thrush,
genius.

1:06:49.504 --> 1:06:51.540
Not here, little thrush.

1:06:51.573 --> 1:06:53.342
Come to the pool.
We don't have much time.

1:06:58.513 --> 1:06:59.848
Guys! Hey!

1:07:01.049 --> 1:07:03.352
Come here! Now!

1:07:03.385 --> 1:07:04.786
How did you get over there
so fast?

1:07:04.819 --> 1:07:05.888
Now!

1:07:06.755 --> 1:07:09.758
I need you boys
to open your minds

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:11.026
for a moment...

1:07:11.059 --> 1:07:12.561
And fucking listen.

1:07:13.795 --> 1:07:19.334
This house, this is not just
a creepy rock and roll house.

1:07:19.367 --> 1:07:22.004
We are standing on a nexus

1:07:22.037 --> 1:07:25.941
that allows spiritual entities
to cross into our world.

1:07:25.974 --> 1:07:28.577
Can it, drummer boy.

1:07:28.943 --> 1:07:30.445
You ever hear of dream widow?

1:07:30.478 --> 1:07:33.048
Of course.
They were supposed to be

1:07:33.081 --> 1:07:34.816
the next Jane's addiction.

1:07:34.849 --> 1:07:36.752
Greg null was a fucking genius.

1:07:36.785 --> 1:07:38.987
Yeah, till he went batshit crazy

1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:40.789
and killed
his whole fucking band.

1:07:40.822 --> 1:07:44.260
Right here in this house.

1:07:46.094 --> 1:07:48.563
Yeah, that's just
rock and roll folklore.

1:07:48.596 --> 1:07:50.432
Mm-mm, I was there.

1:07:50.465 --> 1:07:53.602
Greg null and I were close.
Very close.

1:07:53.635 --> 1:07:56.972
I was his number one groupie
and muse.

1:07:57.005 --> 1:07:59.408
Now we're taking advice
from groupies?

1:07:59.441 --> 1:08:02.044
Hey, watch the labels.
Groupies are people, too.

1:08:03.411 --> 1:08:05.947
You gotta understand,
this was the roaring '90s.

1:08:05.980 --> 1:08:08.483
No one gave a fuck about shit.

1:08:08.516 --> 1:08:13.088
But Greg, he was a visionary,
an artist of the dark.

1:08:13.121 --> 1:08:15.357
We were all into some

1:08:15.390 --> 1:08:16.634
experimental life choices
back then.

1:08:16.658 --> 1:08:19.895
The occult sex,
energy transfers,

1:08:19.928 --> 1:08:21.763
and spectrophilia.

1:08:21.796 --> 1:08:25.067
He possessed this living book

1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:27.770
made from human flesh.

1:08:28.870 --> 1:08:33.108
The book was rumored to hold
the secret incantations...

1:08:33.141 --> 1:08:35.978
Of aleister crowley.

1:08:38.146 --> 1:08:40.515
As time went on,

1:08:40.548 --> 1:08:44.386
something truly sinister
took a hold of Greg.

1:08:44.419 --> 1:08:47.889
He was obsessed with this song
from the book...

1:08:47.922 --> 1:08:51.660
Lacrimis de ebrius.

1:08:51.693 --> 1:08:53.462
"The tears of god."

1:08:53.495 --> 1:08:57.666
Every day he made his band
try to complete this song.

1:08:58.166 --> 1:09:00.769
He believed that perfecting it

1:09:00.802 --> 1:09:03.638
would open an eternal portal...

1:09:03.671 --> 1:09:06.441
And the spirit inside him

1:09:06.474 --> 1:09:08.910
would become
a demonic passage...

1:09:08.943 --> 1:09:11.046
Into our world.

1:09:15.483 --> 1:09:17.052
You guys were ghost fuckers?

1:09:18.586 --> 1:09:22.691
Somehow, the good won out
in Greg

1:09:22.724 --> 1:09:26.962
and he stopped it
the only way he could.

1:09:28.630 --> 1:09:30.165
Greg killed himself

1:09:30.198 --> 1:09:33.435
to stop the completion
of the song.

1:09:33.868 --> 1:09:37.672
But now, the spirit
that possessed him

1:09:37.705 --> 1:09:40.476
has found a new instrument.

1:09:45.814 --> 1:09:49.184
Go! Go! Go! Go! Faster!

1:09:49.217 --> 1:09:50.719
Go! Hurry!

1:09:52.153 --> 1:09:53.989
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1:09:54.022 --> 1:09:57.526
Oh, shit. Fuck. Fucking dolls.

1:09:57.559 --> 1:09:59.661
What the fuck! God damn it!

1:09:59.694 --> 1:10:02.097
I didn't spend the last 20 years

1:10:02.130 --> 1:10:03.799
teaching pilates in encino

1:10:03.832 --> 1:10:05.167
so that thing can have its way!

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:06.811
You moved next door
to this place on purpose?

1:10:06.835 --> 1:10:08.203
Someone had to guard the portal.

1:10:08.236 --> 1:10:10.872
Yeah, well,
he's already been possessed.

1:10:10.905 --> 1:10:12.541
What are we gonna do now?

1:10:13.975 --> 1:10:15.577
Bring him down here.

1:10:15.610 --> 1:10:18.180
Maybe I can just suck it out
the old fashioned way.

1:10:18.213 --> 1:10:21.750
- Oh, hell, no. Bad idea.
- Oh, sorry. Old habits.

1:10:21.783 --> 1:10:23.485
There's got to be a better way.

1:10:23.518 --> 1:10:25.821
Uh, we just call the cops.

1:10:25.854 --> 1:10:27.823
Oh, my god,
that's such a good idea.

1:10:27.856 --> 1:10:30.225
"Hi. Dave grohl's been possessed"

1:10:30.258 --> 1:10:31.860
"by the spirit of Greg null."

1:10:31.893 --> 1:10:34.496
"Now he's on
a murderous rampage."

1:10:34.529 --> 1:10:36.031
Best idea I've heard since,

1:10:36.064 --> 1:10:37.899
"hey, let's move
into this house."

1:10:37.932 --> 1:10:39.768
Okay.
What the fuck should we do?

1:10:39.801 --> 1:10:40.969
Come on.

1:10:42.504 --> 1:10:43.905
The book.

1:10:43.938 --> 1:10:47.976
It uses blood to stay alive.
He uses, um, raccoons.

1:10:48.009 --> 1:10:49.911
Ah, the basement.

1:10:49.944 --> 1:10:51.780
He said something about raccoons

1:10:51.813 --> 1:10:53.215
when he came up
from the basement.

1:10:53.248 --> 1:10:55.484
Okay. Find the book.

1:10:55.517 --> 1:10:58.753
Turn to a passage
called Van houten's protocol.

1:10:58.786 --> 1:11:00.722
That will close the portal

1:11:00.755 --> 1:11:02.657
and send this fucking spirit
back to hell.

1:11:02.690 --> 1:11:03.692
What about you?

1:11:04.559 --> 1:11:06.127
You're going to be in danger

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.096
now that you've
told us all this.

1:11:08.129 --> 1:11:09.698
Ugh.

1:11:09.731 --> 1:11:12.868
You wanna stay back
and make sure I'm safe?

1:11:13.835 --> 1:11:17.239
She's right. Nate, pat,
you guys go find the book.

1:11:17.272 --> 1:11:19.875
Taylor, go keep Dave occupied.

1:11:19.908 --> 1:11:21.209
Drum tracks.

1:11:21.242 --> 1:11:23.211
You haven't done
any drum tracks yet.

1:11:23.244 --> 1:11:25.180
I ain't going anywhere near

1:11:25.213 --> 1:11:26.781
that fucking psycho. Fuck that.

1:11:26.814 --> 1:11:28.583
No, just go up there
and fuck up the drums

1:11:28.616 --> 1:11:29.918
so he can't finish the song.

1:11:29.951 --> 1:11:31.253
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

1:11:31.286 --> 1:11:33.655
Eat a bag of dicks, smear.

1:11:33.688 --> 1:11:34.990
Be careful,

1:11:35.023 --> 1:11:37.692
this is far
from a simple possession.

1:11:37.725 --> 1:11:40.896
That caretaker is
more than just Greg null.

1:11:41.262 --> 1:11:44.700
There is an evil spirit
inside him.

1:11:48.703 --> 1:11:51.072
- Let's go.
- No, I said I'm not doing it!

1:11:51.105 --> 1:11:52.750
I'm not going near
that motherfucking house!

1:11:52.774 --> 1:11:53.675
Come on!

1:11:53.708 --> 1:11:55.143
Let's go! Come on!

1:11:55.176 --> 1:11:57.112
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

1:12:15.763 --> 1:12:17.099
Yes.

1:12:18.299 --> 1:12:21.636
- He took the fucking sim card!
- Quick.

1:12:29.310 --> 1:12:31.146
I'll keep you so fucking safe
right now.

1:12:31.179 --> 1:12:33.181
I bet you will.

1:12:34.716 --> 1:12:36.351
I wanna take this off.
Take this off.

1:12:36.384 --> 1:12:38.787
Can't get it off!

1:12:43.391 --> 1:12:45.794
Wait, wait, wait.
Put some music on

1:12:45.827 --> 1:12:47.262
so Dave doesn't hear us.

1:12:47.295 --> 1:12:49.064
All right.

1:13:05.313 --> 1:13:07.282
Okay, let's go.

1:13:07.315 --> 1:13:10.719
Maybe I should wait up here,
to be a lookout?

1:13:10.752 --> 1:13:12.988
No fucking way, dude. Come on.

1:13:29.671 --> 1:13:31.406
My latest guilty pleasure.

1:13:31.439 --> 1:13:36.011
Ooh. That is my shit! Mm!

1:13:36.044 --> 1:13:37.679
Mm-hmm.

1:13:37.712 --> 1:13:40.048
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

1:13:58.733 --> 1:14:01.803
This is my favorite part!
This is my favorite part!

1:14:01.836 --> 1:14:04.072
Ooh, you're nasty. I like that.

1:14:44.045 --> 1:14:48.149
Jesus...
Somebody lived down here.

1:14:48.182 --> 1:14:52.154
Greg null,
or whatever he is now.

1:15:09.070 --> 1:15:14.076
Ugh. Fuck, dude. Look!

1:15:16.277 --> 1:15:19.748
"The sacrifice feeds the book."

1:15:25.953 --> 1:15:28.090
Poor little guy.

1:15:50.945 --> 1:15:54.249
Pat, find me something
to pry this open with.

1:17:08.189 --> 1:17:09.958
Fuck!

1:17:25.072 --> 1:17:28.310
Come on!

1:17:40.955 --> 1:17:43.458
Hey, buddy. How you doing, man?

1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:47.095
The ending.

1:17:48.596 --> 1:17:50.899
I can hear it.

1:17:51.699 --> 1:17:54.636
All we need to do
is lay down the drums.

1:17:55.536 --> 1:17:57.672
The drums?
Why don't you and shifty

1:17:57.705 --> 1:17:59.908
do some more guitars?

1:18:02.576 --> 1:18:04.980
Shifty's done.

1:18:21.662 --> 1:18:23.365
Warm up.

1:18:26.300 --> 1:18:28.103
You're next.

1:18:33.207 --> 1:18:34.451
- What's happening?
- Fucking hell!

1:18:34.475 --> 1:18:36.378
With these fucking demons!

1:18:37.211 --> 1:18:38.346
There's, like,

1:18:38.379 --> 1:18:40.281
real fucking demons, Nate!

1:18:40.314 --> 1:18:41.917
Lacrimis de ebrius.

1:18:42.516 --> 1:18:44.486
Demonic incantations.

1:18:46.253 --> 1:18:49.090
Ah. Here we go, exorcisms.

1:19:03.104 --> 1:19:06.441
No, no, no, that's not it.
That's not it.

1:19:06.474 --> 1:19:08.109
You're doing this
on purpose, man.

1:19:08.142 --> 1:19:10.287
No, man. I'm just trying to
get this fucking ending right.

1:19:10.311 --> 1:19:13.247
Okay, it's fucking simple.
It just goes...

1:19:16.017 --> 1:19:17.986
I'm pretty sure that's
what I was doing, man.

1:19:18.019 --> 1:19:19.620
Pretty sure it's not.

1:19:19.653 --> 1:19:22.390
Dude, why don't we just wait
for Nate and pat to get here?

1:19:22.423 --> 1:19:24.359
Nate and pat?

1:19:24.392 --> 1:19:25.626
Fuck them!

1:19:25.659 --> 1:19:27.495
What do they know
about fucking drums?

1:19:27.528 --> 1:19:29.764
You and me, right?
We're drummers.

1:19:29.797 --> 1:19:31.733
We speak the same language.

1:19:31.766 --> 1:19:33.768
Let's finish the fucking track.

1:19:33.801 --> 1:19:35.636
Can't we just wait, dude?

1:19:35.669 --> 1:19:37.338
Let's just finish
the fucking track

1:19:37.371 --> 1:19:39.040
and get out of here!

1:19:39.073 --> 1:19:41.642
It's not Dave. You're not Dave.

1:19:41.675 --> 1:19:44.045
What did you just say?

1:19:44.078 --> 1:19:45.680
I didn't say anything, man.

1:19:47.214 --> 1:19:50.051
Just play the fucking drums!

1:20:16.077 --> 1:20:18.380
Yeah. That's it.

1:20:21.182 --> 1:20:23.151
Yeah!

1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:27.688
That's it!

1:20:59.153 --> 1:21:02.157
There you go, man.
I finished the fucking song.

1:21:03.324 --> 1:21:04.659
You did.

1:21:08.429 --> 1:21:09.731
Thank you.

"The Van houten protocol
for demonic cleansing."

1:21:25.846 --> 1:21:27.381
It's imperative to confirm

1:21:27.414 --> 1:21:29.126
the possessing entity
is of demonic origin...

1:21:29.150 --> 1:21:30.685
Before employing
these techniques.

1:21:30.718 --> 1:21:31.853
Look for these signs.

1:21:31.886 --> 1:21:34.322
"One, digestive system shutdown."

1:21:38.826 --> 1:21:42.296
No more oatmeal beer bongs
for Davey.

"Ability to levitate objects
or defy gravity."

1:21:44.698 --> 1:21:46.767
Just play nice with
this I sharp bullshit, right?

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:48.703
Play e flat and get through it.

1:21:48.736 --> 1:21:52.507
It's an I! I!

1:21:53.774 --> 1:21:55.710
"Incessant masturbation."

1:21:56.277 --> 1:21:57.578
Dave!

1:21:57.611 --> 1:21:58.813
What are you doing in there?

1:21:58.846 --> 1:22:00.348
Sounds like
you're playing Patty cake

1:22:00.381 --> 1:22:02.183
with a soft chicken dumpling!

1:22:02.216 --> 1:22:04.485
- Didn't he do that already?
- Does that disqualify him?

1:22:04.518 --> 1:22:07.522
This demonic shit's complicated.

Fuck, I think he ate Chris.

1:22:13.827 --> 1:22:15.730
Fuck, he's definitely possessed.

1:22:15.763 --> 1:22:18.700
Okay. So, what do we do?

1:22:19.433 --> 1:22:21.302
We go save his ass.

1:22:26.774 --> 1:22:28.710
That's not good.

1:22:33.781 --> 1:22:35.816
What's he doing?

1:22:59.974 --> 1:23:03.678
Oh, my god.
I think we're too late!

1:23:03.711 --> 1:23:05.680
That's Taylor! Look!

1:23:10.884 --> 1:23:13.354
Read the book.
We gotta stop this!

1:23:18.259 --> 1:23:20.428
Here we go. To begin
the Van houten protocol...

1:23:20.461 --> 1:23:21.662
Quiet!

1:23:44.385 --> 1:23:45.385
Fuck!

1:24:11.011 --> 1:24:12.847
Fuck.

1:24:16.083 --> 1:24:17.885

Jesus! Jesus! Fuck!

1:24:30.964 --> 1:24:32.700

for decades.

He's a slave to music.

The band?

1:26:28.215 --> 1:26:31.719
What about them?
Rami got what he wanted.

1:26:31.752 --> 1:26:34.555
Taylor finished the song.

1:26:34.588 --> 1:26:37.691
And Chris... Chris was right.

Do you see him? Where did he go?

1:27:21.735 --> 1:27:24.071
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1:27:32.579 --> 1:27:34.114
Oh, my god!

1:27:36.283 --> 1:27:37.718
You guys!

1:27:48.896 --> 1:27:50.631
Oh, god.

1:27:51.598 --> 1:27:54.568
Ugh, last thing I remember

1:27:54.601 --> 1:27:56.170
is that fucking raccoon, man,

1:27:56.203 --> 1:27:58.639
and then poof!

1:27:58.672 --> 1:28:01.642
Dude, we got some bad news.

1:28:01.675 --> 1:28:02.943
Oh, my god, the song.

1:28:02.976 --> 1:28:04.545
We cannot finish the song, okay?

1:28:04.578 --> 1:28:06.547
Whatever's in that basement,
we can't let it out.

1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:08.549
No, it's about the guys.

1:28:08.582 --> 1:28:10.684
I think I swallowed
some pool water.

1:28:13.220 --> 1:28:16.023
I fucking love you guys, man.

1:28:16.056 --> 1:28:19.126

1:28:52.059 --> 1:28:54.795
God, that tastes like shit!

1:28:55.228 --> 1:28:56.864
It's all right, buddy.
You're okay now.

1:28:56.897 --> 1:28:58.632
Oh, god.

1:29:21.021 --> 1:29:22.890
No.

1:29:24.157 --> 1:29:26.827
No! No!

1:29:38.805 --> 1:29:41.308
Now I'll kill you,

1:29:41.341 --> 1:29:45.212
like the rest
of your pathetic little band.

1:30:09.436 --> 1:30:12.172

Fuck you!

1:30:14.274 --> 1:30:16.944
Fuck you!

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:39.266
Killed us. Crushed our dreams.

1:30:39.299 --> 1:30:45.206
You were weak.
The curse is lifted.

1:30:46.073 --> 1:30:48.208
Now you will suffer.

1:30:48.241 --> 1:30:51.445
Suffer. Suffer. Suffer.

1:32:18.799 --> 1:32:22.436
The sacrifice feeds the book.

1:32:27.107 --> 1:32:28.175
Thank you.

1:32:52.933 --> 1:32:55.236
Okay.

1:32:57.270 --> 1:32:59.974
Get me the fuck
out of here, man.

1:33:32.339 --> 1:33:34.074
The fucking Van.

1:33:34.107 --> 1:33:36.343
Hey, we're gonna grab the Van.
Stay here.

1:33:36.376 --> 1:33:38.078
Okay.

1:34:02.636 --> 1:34:07.107
Oh, fuck! We gave shitty Dave
the keys! Ugh.

1:34:07.140 --> 1:34:09.009
Just get in.

1:34:10.176 --> 1:34:11.578
What are you doing?

1:34:11.611 --> 1:34:13.314
I'm gonna do it
the old-fashioned way.

1:34:21.054 --> 1:34:23.657
Hit the gas
when the wire makes contact.

1:34:23.690 --> 1:34:24.992
What?

1:34:25.025 --> 1:34:28.028
You need to hit the gas
when I spark it!

1:34:45.412 --> 1:34:47.147
What are you doing here?

1:34:47.180 --> 1:34:49.950
See if there's any others left.

1:34:54.721 --> 1:34:57.391
Oh, my god.
Shill, thank god you're here.

1:34:57.424 --> 1:35:01.161
This house is a fucking
shit show, man!

1:35:01.194 --> 1:35:03.063
You have no idea
what we just went through.

1:35:03.096 --> 1:35:06.566
The devil rules
all of rock and roll.

1:35:06.599 --> 1:35:09.002
What? No, no, no. Listen.

1:35:09.035 --> 1:35:12.339
This place is a disaster, okay?

1:35:12.372 --> 1:35:14.374
It's been a fucking nightmare
recording here!

1:35:14.407 --> 1:35:15.618
Why did you send us
to this house?

1:35:15.642 --> 1:35:18.011
Don't give me
your sob story, Dave.

1:35:18.044 --> 1:35:19.546
I know exactly what's going on.

1:35:20.113 --> 1:35:22.449
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

1:35:22.482 --> 1:35:25.018
You know, rock and roll...

1:35:25.051 --> 1:35:27.654
It hasn't been relevant
for a long time.

1:35:27.687 --> 1:35:30.557
It needs an infusion.

1:35:31.224 --> 1:35:32.326
Okay, I don't know

1:35:32.359 --> 1:35:34.361
what kind of weird shit
you're into...

1:35:34.394 --> 1:35:39.733
The devil will make
rock and roll relevant again.

1:35:39.766 --> 1:35:43.270
The devil
will make it dangerous.

1:35:45.372 --> 1:35:48.242
You finished the song,
didn't you, Dave?

1:35:48.608 --> 1:35:50.010
Uh...

1:35:50.043 --> 1:35:52.980
No, not yet. It's complicated.

1:35:53.013 --> 1:35:54.247
We're close.

1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:57.017
It's just the arrangement
and the composition is...

1:35:57.050 --> 1:36:01.355
I've been waiting 20 years
to finish that song!

1:36:01.388 --> 1:36:03.290
I just needed the right vehicle.

1:36:03.323 --> 1:36:06.193
Someone who could handle
all that evil.

1:36:06.226 --> 1:36:07.294
I needed you.

1:36:09.396 --> 1:36:13.033
First of all, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
nice fucking cape.

1:36:13.066 --> 1:36:15.502
Second of all,
you're so fucking lame!

1:36:15.535 --> 1:36:17.137
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1:36:17.170 --> 1:36:18.314
Sending us
to this fucking shithole

1:36:18.338 --> 1:36:19.406
to make a record?

1:36:19.439 --> 1:36:20.707
You're just a manager, okay?

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.343
You don't know the first
fucking thing about music!

1:36:23.376 --> 1:36:25.546
You just wanna make your money.

1:36:29.382 --> 1:36:32.252
I made you!

1:36:44.197 --> 1:36:47.167
Pat! Pat, there's something
back there, come on!

1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:49.103
Oh, shit!

1:37:02.182 --> 1:37:03.817
Pat, move, move, move!

1:37:03.850 --> 1:37:06.186
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing? Hold on a minute!

1:37:06.419 --> 1:37:08.722
Oh, motherf...!

1:37:16.496 --> 1:37:18.765
Dude, the time is
fucking nigh! Start the car!

1:37:18.798 --> 1:37:21.201
Nate, give me a fucking
minute! I almost got it!

1:37:21.234 --> 1:37:24.137
Come on, move!
It's getting closer!

1:37:24.170 --> 1:37:25.381
It's almost here, pat. Come on!

1:37:25.405 --> 1:37:26.925
What the fuck are you
doing down there?

1:37:37.417 --> 1:37:39.586
Dude! Pat, now, now, now!

1:37:39.619 --> 1:37:42.089
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know,
I know, I know! Hold on!

1:37:42.655 --> 1:37:44.357
Hi, guys.

1:37:44.390 --> 1:37:46.693
Stop fighting me, Dave.

1:37:46.726 --> 1:37:48.595
Stop fighting me.

1:37:48.628 --> 1:37:50.497
I'm trying to help you!

1:37:51.498 --> 1:37:53.200

1:37:54.367 --> 1:37:59.506

1:37:59.539 --> 1:38:02.543

1:38:15.355 --> 1:38:16.723
Nate!

1:38:27.867 --> 1:38:31.805
Oh, fuck! Pat! Fuck.

1:38:31.838 --> 1:38:35.242
Pat! Sorry, pat! I'm sorry!

1:38:52.392 --> 1:38:54.595
Barb?

1:39:25.425 --> 1:39:28.795
Help? I killed my band
because of your help!

1:39:28.828 --> 1:39:31.865
Die, you cocksucker! Die!

1:39:34.567 --> 1:39:36.403
You finished it.

1:39:36.436 --> 1:39:39.873
You finished the song,
didn't you?

1:39:39.906 --> 1:39:41.542
You finished it.

1:39:55.855 --> 1:40:00.928
You finished it.
You did, didn't you?

1:40:01.928 --> 1:40:03.330
Ah.

1:40:03.997 --> 1:40:06.633
Look at the rage in your eyes.

1:40:08.301 --> 1:40:10.771
You're not Dave grohl.

1:40:13.039 --> 1:40:16.610
It's time for your solo career.

1:40:35.595 --> 1:40:36.739
We're ready for you, brother.

1:40:36.763 --> 1:40:38.966
That is a full house out there.

1:40:40.733 --> 1:40:42.769
You all good, Dave?

1:40:43.569 --> 1:40:45.872
Never better.

1:40:45.905 --> 1:40:47.307
Okay.
