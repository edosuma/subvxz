09:40.536 --> 09:43.017
YOU KNOW, RIO 2016--
THAT'S THE GOAL.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.150
AND, UH, PARKMAN WAS
YOUR FIRST CHOICE AS COACH?

09:46.150 --> 09:50.198
YOU BET. UH... PARKMAN
OFFERING TO COACH YOUR KID?

09:50.198 --> 09:52.243
AH, YOU KNOW, HE'S PROBABLY
TOO BUSY WITH KIMMY

09:52.243 --> 09:54.463
TO TAKE YOUR KID ON,
BUT, UH, HE'S THE BEST.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.030
YEAH?OH, YEAH.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.206
HE GOT KIMMY TO BEAR DOWN
IN WAYS I NEVER COULD.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.816
SHE'S ALWAYS TEXTING
WITH FRIENDS,

09:59.816 --> 10:01.905
WANTING TO GO FOR PIZZAS
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT WITH BOYS.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.167
YOU KNOW? NO MORE OF THAT.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.821
MM. THANK GOODNESS.YEAH. YEAH.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.171
AND I NEVER FELT
I HAD TO WORRY

10:07.171 --> 10:08.869
ABOUT HER BEING ALONE
WITH HIM.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.698
WELL, THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT,
WOULDN'T IT?YEAH.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.874
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
[sniffles]

10:18.008 --> 10:20.054
DID MR. PARKMAN EVER TALK
ABOUT HIS PERSONAL LIFE?

10:20.054 --> 10:22.360
NO, NEVER.
I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS SOMETIMES

10:22.360 --> 10:25.537
JUST TO BE POLITE, YOU KNOW,
AND HE WOULD JUST BE VERY VAGUE.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.061
THANK YOU.MM-HMM.

10:27.061 --> 10:30.368
[clicks tongue and sighs]
UH, EXCUSE ME--OOH!

10:30.368 --> 10:32.283
WHOA, CAREFUL.[laughs]

10:32.283 --> 10:33.763
YOU ALL RIGHT?YEAH.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.765
GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
WORN HEELS. [laughs]

10:35.765 --> 10:38.463
UM, MY LITTLE SISTER'S
INTERESTED IN GYMNASTICS.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.552
COULD YOU HELP EXPLAIN
THIS PRICING TO ME?

10:40.552 --> 10:42.772
UH, I DON'T WORK HERE.OH. I--

10:42.772 --> 10:44.252
[man] EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE THE GUY FROM CBI?

10:44.252 --> 10:46.123
THAT'S RIGHT.
AGENT KIMBALL CHO.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.430
I'M BILL MYLAR, CO-OWNER.
WE TALKED ON THE PHONE.RIGHT.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.128
OH, WAIT. YOU'RE HERE
INVESTIGATING SOMETHING?

10:51.128 --> 10:53.957
A MURDER.I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA COME
DIRECTLY TO MY OFFICE.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.351
UH, WE DECIDED TO TALK
TO COME OF YOUR CLIENTELE.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.787
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

10:57.787 --> 10:59.267
ANYTHING THAT HELPS,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

10:59.267 --> 11:00.790
EVERYBODY HERE AT THE GYM
LOVED CHAD.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.836
MM. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT
ABOUT THE DEAD.

11:02.836 --> 11:06.100
SELDOM IS IT TRUE. IS THERE
SOMEPLACE PRIVATE WE CAN TALK?

11:09.016 --> 11:10.365
[sighs]

11:10.365 --> 11:14.543
SO... YOU'RE A POLICEMAN.
[chuckles]

11:14.543 --> 11:17.677
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M EMBARRASSED. [giggles]

11:17.677 --> 11:19.809
SOMEBODY DIED?YES.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.463
OH, MY GOSH, A MURDER?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.595
DID YOU KNOW CHAD PARKMAN?THE GYM OWNER?

11:23.595 --> 11:25.989
NO. WHAT HAPPENED?

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
THERE'S A STAFF MEMBER
RIGHT OVER THERE.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.514
THEY CAN TELL YOU
ABOUT THE PRICING.

11:31.734 --> 11:35.390
TOUGH GUY, HUH?
[chuckling]

11:35.390 --> 11:37.000
THANKS.

11:38.523 --> 11:42.136
EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU
HELP ME WITH THIS PRICING?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.441
[fountain trickling]

11:43.441 --> 11:45.748
I'M SORRY WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.533
NOW I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I AM COMPLETELY COMMITTED

11:48.533 --> 11:50.666
TO FINDING WHOEVER
KILLED MR. PARKMAN.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.668
OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME.

11:52.668 --> 11:56.150
IN LIGHT OF THAT, I-I WAS
WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE ME

11:56.150 --> 11:59.544
A LITTLE HISTORY AS TO
MR. PARKMAN'S ROLE IN VISUALIZE.

11:59.544 --> 12:00.981
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE

12:00.981 --> 12:03.505
LINKING HIM
TO THE ORGANIZATION.

12:03.505 --> 12:06.813
CHAD'S EYES WERE OPENED
TO THE TRUTH ONLY RECENTLY.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.424
BUT HE WAS DEEPLY COMMITTED.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.122
WE HAD BIG PLANS FOR HIM.WHAT KIND OF PLANS?

12:12.122 --> 12:14.995
CHAD PARKMAN HAD VERY POSITIVE
NAME RECOGNITION

12:14.995 --> 12:16.692
ACROSS ALL QUADRANTS.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.216
THE MOST COMMONLY USED WORD
TO DESCRIBE HIM

12:19.216 --> 12:20.696
WAS "TRUSTWORTHY."

12:20.696 --> 12:23.307
SO YOU WERE GONNA USE HIM
FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH?

12:23.307 --> 12:25.179
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YES.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.833
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
SOMEONE KILLED HIM?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.660
IT'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.968
UH, WHAT WAS MR. PARKMAN'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH BRET STILES?

12:31.968 --> 12:35.450
BRET STILES WAS A GUIDE
AND A BEACON FOR CHAD,

12:35.450 --> 12:37.104
AS HE IS FOR ALL OF US.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.149
AND WHERE IS MR. STILES?

12:39.149 --> 12:40.672
I CAN'T BE CERTAIN.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.197
REALLY? YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS?

12:44.546 --> 12:46.809
IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME
TO KNOW WHERE HE IS

12:46.809 --> 12:48.724
IN PHYSICAL SPACE.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.379
IF HE NEEDS ME,
HE WILL FIND ME.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.859
[cell phone rings]

12:52.859 --> 12:54.861
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
HEY, RIGS.

12:56.819 --> 13:00.214
[Rigsby] HEY.
I'M AT THE CARJACKING SCENE.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.737
SO THE VICTIM HERE
GOT SHOT.

13:01.737 --> 13:05.436
ON THE SEAT NEXT TO HIM,
WE HAVE A BLOODY KNIFE.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.525
Do you think it's the same knife
that was used to kill Parkman?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.005
YEAH, IT COULD BE.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.880
YOU CAN SEE THE HOTEL
FROM HERE.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
GET THAT KNIFE TO THE LAB.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.535
WILL DO, BOSS.I'm on my way.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.841
OKAY.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.675
[man] GOOD.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.372
[Mylar] PARKMAN WAS THE FACE
OF THE BUSINESS.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.678
I DO THE BUSINESS.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.767
AND HOW IS BUSINESS?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.378
PHENOMENAL.
WE'RE PLANNING ON EXPANDING

13:34.378 --> 13:36.598
TO THE SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST,
EVERY PLACE.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.426
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.428
WELL, THERE ARE UPSIDES
TO PARKMAN'S DEATH,

13:40.428 --> 13:41.690
LET'S BE HONEST.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.170
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:43.170 --> 13:44.780
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A VERY
SICK THING TO SAY.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.434
WELL, THINK ABOUT ALL
THE SYMPATHETIC PRESS COVERAGE.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.088
THAT'S FREE PUBLICITY
RIGHT THERE.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.438
PLUS THE WHOLE VISUALIZE MESS
GOES AWAY.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.874
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.615
WELL, YOU'VE HEARD
OF VISUALIZE, RIGHT?

13:53.615 --> 13:55.182
OF COURSE I HAVE.
IT'S THAT WACKO CULT.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.748
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

13:56.748 --> 13:59.664
YEAH, WELL, PARKMAN WAS
A MEMBER OF VISUALIZE.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.928
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?NO.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.279
[leaping, mats echoing]

14:05.279 --> 14:07.455
YOU SURE?YES, I'M SURE.

14:21.164 --> 14:24.124
TELL ME, DID CHAD TALK ABOUT
VISUALIZE A LOT?

14:24.124 --> 14:26.430
YEAH, SURE.
UH... HE WAS A MEMBER.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.606
SOME KIND OF WEIRD
SELF-HELP GROUP.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.521
IT'S NOT MY THING,
BUT IF IT HELPED HIM COACH,

14:30.521 --> 14:31.871
ALL THE POWER TO HIM.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.134
MM. AND, UH, MR. MYLAR--

14:34.134 --> 14:35.962
HOW DID HE FEEL
ABOUT VISUALIZE?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.485
OH, MYLAR HATED THAT STUFF.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.703
YOU'D SEE THEM ARGUING
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.271
OH, REALLY?
HATED IT, DID HE? HMM.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.577
OH.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.103
YOU GOT ME.
A FOOLISH LIE.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.801
THE TRUTH--I WAS MAD AS HELL
ABOUT VISUALIZE.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.325
I'M TRYING TO EXPAND
OUR BUSINESS,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.631
HE JOINS SOME MOONBAT CULT?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.634
WE FOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT,
SO NOW I FEEL GUILTY

14:56.634 --> 14:58.985
THAT WE ENDED ON BAD TERMS.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.638
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.643
YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?

15:05.643 --> 15:08.081
[breathes sharply]
BOSS WANTS US BACK.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.170
LISBON, YOU FIND SOMETHING?

15:10.170 --> 15:11.693
THE KNIFE THAT KILLED PARKMAN

15:11.693 --> 15:13.347
AT THE SITE
OF RIGSBY'S CARJACKING.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.131
UH, WHAT WAS
THE CARJACKING VICTIM'S NAME?

15:15.131 --> 15:17.133
FROST. DEVIN FROST.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.048
TELL ME ABOUT DEVIN FROST.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.877
DEVIN? HE USED TO WORK HERE.
HE'S A GOOD KID.

15:21.877 --> 15:26.316
INTERESTING NEWS.
THE PLOT THICKENS.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.491
PLOT THICKENS.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.232
LISBON?

15:29.232 --> 15:31.104
SHE'S GONE.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.371
WE'RE IN AN ALLEY
ABOUT A BLOCK FROM THE HOTEL.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.763
WE FOUND A GUN.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.635
IS IT THE GUN
USED TO KILL FROST?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.811
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT. AND THERE'S
DUCT TAPE ON THE BARREL.

15:42.811 --> 15:46.902
FROM THE SILENCER.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.904
SEE IF WE CAN GET
ANY FINGERPRINTS.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.166
WILL DO. BYE.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.301
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT
THE GUN.YEAH?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.825
IT'S ON ITS WAY TO FORENSICS
NOW, BUT IT'S A PRETTY SURE BET.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.827
WELL, AS SOON AS HAFFNER
GETS HERE, WE'LL GET STARTED.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.481
I DON'T LIKE IT, BOSS.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.352
UH... HAFFNER SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE IN OUR OFFICES.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.963
HE'S ONE OF JANE'S
RED JOHN SUSPECTS.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.529
AND HE'S A MEMBER
OF VISUALIZE.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.748
WHICH IS RUN BY ANOTHER
RED JOHN SUSPECT.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.141
WE SHOULD BE
INVESTIGATING HIM,

16:08.141 --> 16:09.316
NOT LETTING HIM JOIN
OUR INVESTIGATION.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.274
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
A CHOICE.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.320
MIGHT AS WELL MAKE
THE MOST OF IT. HAFFNER!

16:13.320 --> 16:14.974
TERESA.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.543
LOVELY AS ALWAYS.
[exhales]

16:20.892 --> 16:23.199
GUYS. SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT
SO FAR?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.331
WELL, LET'S SEE.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.336
PARKMAN ENTERED THE HOTEL
AT 10:48.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.295
HE WAS ANXIOUS,
AND WITNESSES GOT THE IMPRESSION

16:32.295 --> 16:34.167
THAT HE WAS BEING PURSUED.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.560
HE HAS AN ALTERCATION
IN THE ELEVATOR,

16:36.560 --> 16:39.911
AND PARKMAN FLEES TO HIS ROOM
AT APPROXIMATELY 10:51.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.480
AND AT 10:58, HOTEL SECURITY
OPENED PARKMAN'S ROOM

16:43.480 --> 16:46.135
TO FIND HIM DYING ON THE FLOOR
WITH A STAB WOUND.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.485
AT 12 PAST 11:00,
POLICE AND E.M.T.s ARRIVE,

16:48.485 --> 16:50.270
BUT THEY PRONOUNCE PARKMAN
DEAD AT THE SCENE.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.185
NOBODY COULD HAVE ENTERED
OR LEFT THE ROOM

16:52.185 --> 16:54.056
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD
WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.145
HUH.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.365
HERE'S THE PARK.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.106
THE HOTEL'S ON THE ONE SIDE,

17:00.106 --> 17:02.412
AND THIS IS WHERE DEVIN FROST
WAS MURDERED--

17:02.412 --> 17:04.110
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PARK.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.459
NOW, IN FRONT'S CAR,
THERE'S A KNIFE

17:05.459 --> 17:06.764
WITH PARKMAN'S BLOOD
ON THE BLADE

17:06.764 --> 17:08.766
AND FROST'S FINGERPRINTS
ON THE HANDLE.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.594
WE ALSO FOUND
A HOMEMADE SILENCER IN THE CAR.

17:10.594 --> 17:13.771
AND WE FOUND THE GUN THAT
BELONGS TO THE SILENCER HERE,

17:13.771 --> 17:16.774
WHICH, GIVEN THE TIMELINE, SEEMS
TO BE A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY.

17:16.774 --> 17:20.474
SO... FROST STABBED PARKMAN

17:20.474 --> 17:23.520
AND SOMEHOW LEFT THE HOTEL
WITHOUT BEING SEEN,

17:23.520 --> 17:25.914
AND THEN AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT
KILLED FROST?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.350
IT WOULD LOOK THAT WAY.

17:27.350 --> 17:28.873
THE SILENCER DIDN'T WORK
TOO WELL.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.179
WE HAVE THREE WITNESSES
WHO HEARD A GUNSHOT

17:30.179 --> 17:31.398
AROUND 10:57.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.443
WHAT, SO FROST GOT SHOT

17:33.443 --> 17:35.489
IN HIS CAR AT ALMOST
THE EXACT SAME TIME

17:35.489 --> 17:38.231
THAT HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY
IN THE HOTEL STABBING PARKMAN?

17:38.231 --> 17:39.536
WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.060
CORRECT.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.453
hSO, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR AN UNKNOWN SUSPECT

17:43.453 --> 17:47.370
WHO IS A MAGICIAN
OR QUITE POSSIBLY A WIZARD

17:47.370 --> 17:48.719
OF SOME KIND.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.895
GREAT WORK, GUYS.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.723
UH, WE'VE BROUGHT IN MYLAR,
THE OWNER OF THE GYM.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.769
WE'RE HOPING HE CAN SHED
SOME LIGHT ON THIS,

17:54.769 --> 17:57.076
OR AT LEAST GIVE US
A PLAUSIBLE MOTIVE.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.729
[clicks tongue]
OKAY THEN.

17:58.729 --> 18:01.341
WELL, I'M SO GLAD WE GOT
THE "A" TEAM WORKING THIS CASE.

18:01.341 --> 18:04.039
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE HOTEL
AND LOOK THINGS OVER AGAIN.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.302
CIAO,KIDS.

18:12.526 --> 18:15.398
JANE SAID NOT TO LEAN ON MYLAR
TOO HARD.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.313
JUST ASK HIM ABOUT
PARKMAN AND FROST

18:17.313 --> 18:18.923
AND SEE HOW HE REACTS.YOU GOT IT.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.100
[knocks on door]HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.363
WEIRD REPORT JUST
CAME OVER MY DESK.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.322
IT'S ABOUT BOB KIRKLAND.WHAT, THE PSYCHOTIC HOMELAND
SECURITY AGENT WE ARRESTED?

18:26.322 --> 18:27.367
YEAH. HE'S DEAD.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.197
DEAD? HOW'D HE DIE?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.720
THE REPORT SAYS
HE WAS KILLED

18:32.720 --> 18:34.809
ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE
FROM PRISON.SERIOUSLY?

18:34.809 --> 18:37.551
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT,
DOES IT?NO, IT DOESN'T.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.901
I SHOULD CHECK IT OUT, RIGHT?FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
AND WHY.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.642
WILL DO, BOSS.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.034
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET
FROM MYLAR.YOU GOT IT.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.476
HOW LONG HAD DEVIN FROST
WORKED FOR YOU AT THE GYM?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.391
COUPLE YEARS.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.783
WHAT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHAD PARKMAN?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.002
PARKMAN HAD COACHED HIM

18:54.002 --> 18:55.264
AND BROUGHT HIM ON
AS AN ASSISTANT.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.961
WAS FROST A MEMBER
OF VISUALIZE?

18:56.961 --> 18:59.442
HIM? I DON'T THINK SO.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.140
ONE THING ABOUT THOSE
VISUALIZE NUTS--

19:01.140 --> 19:02.576
THEY GOT A WORK ETHIC.

19:02.576 --> 19:03.751
AND FROST NOT SO MUCH?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.539
IS THAT WHY YOU FIRED HIM?

19:09.539 --> 19:10.671
I DIDN'T. HE QUIT.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.022
REALLY? WHEN?

19:14.022 --> 19:15.545
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.634
PARKMAN WENT TO A GYMNASTICS
TOURNAMENT IN EUROPE.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.027
IN THE PAST,
FROST WENT WITH HIM.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.724
THIS TIME, HE DIDN'T.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.727
INSTEAD HE WALKED IN, TOLD ME
HE WAS QUITTING, WALKED OUT.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.902
LAST TIME I SAW HIM.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.730
HE AND PARKMAN
GET INTO A FIGHT?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.819
NO, UH... I JUST FIGURED HE GOT
A BETTER OFFER SOMEWHERE ELSE

19:28.819 --> 19:30.386
AND WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE

19:30.386 --> 19:32.083
OF PARKMAN NOT BEING AROUND
TO QUIT TO ME.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.434
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?LIKE I SAID,
PARKMAN HAD BEEN

19:34.434 --> 19:36.610
FROST'S MENTOR
SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.046
I DON'T THINK HE HAD
THE COURAGE

19:38.046 --> 19:40.048
TO QUIT TO PARKMAN'S FACE.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.183
YOU THINK MYLAR
IS OUR KILLER?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.706
EH.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.229
ME, NEITHER.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.970
COOPER WAS AWFULLY CAGEY
WITH YOU

19:48.970 --> 19:50.841
ABOUT STILES' WHEREABOUTS,
WASN'T HE?

19:50.841 --> 19:54.105
MM-HMM. AFTER I SPOKE
TO COOPER, I DID SOME DIGGING.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.891
STILES IS MISSING.
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
REALLY? WHEN?AROUND THE SAME TIME
RED JOHN SENT YOU

19:59.241 --> 20:01.200
THE LORELEI MARTINS TAPE.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.376
BOSS? I JUST GOT
FROST'S PHONE RECORDS.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.681
LOOK AT THIS.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.161
THAT'S RAY HAFFNER'S
CELL PHONE.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.423
FROST CALLED IT THREE TIMES

20:07.423 --> 20:09.164
THE WEEK BEFORE
HE STABBED PARKMAN.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.600
WELL, LET'S GO SEE

20:10.600 --> 20:12.689
WHAT BROTHER RAY HAS TO SAY
ABOUT THAT.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.085
HE'S NOT HERE.
HE WENT TO THE HOTEL.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.087
HE SAID HE HAD TO CHECK
ON SOMETHING.THEN WE'LL GO THERE.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.132
NO, YOU STAY HERE.
GRACE AND I WILL GO.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.309
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.WE'LL BE FINE.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.745
HE'S MORE LIKELY TO LET
SOMETHING SLIP TO US

20:24.745 --> 20:26.137
THAN HE WOULD TO YOU.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.661
ALL RIGHT. BUT WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO,

20:27.661 --> 20:29.053
JUST SIT AROUND?

20:29.053 --> 20:30.925
WELL, WE STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT

20:30.925 --> 20:32.796
HOW FROST GOT OUT OF THE HOTEL
ROOM AFTER HE STABBED PARKMAN.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.407
EXCEPT FROST COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THERE

20:34.407 --> 20:35.625
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
COULD HE?

20:35.625 --> 20:37.279
YOU SAID IT WAS A TRICK.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.020
FIGURE IT OUT.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.329
I GOT THE NAME
OF THE SAC P.D. DETECTIVE

20:43.329 --> 20:44.852
WHO INVESTIGATED
KIRKLAND'S SHOOTING.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.289
HE'S GONNA COME BY CBI.GOOD WORK.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.901
HEY, MAN.
USUAL, PLEASE.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.294
YOU WANT ANYTHING?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.427
YEAH, COFFEE. BLACK.

20:54.427 --> 20:58.257
IT'S A FRUIT STAND, CHO.
THEY SELL FRUIT.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.215
OKAY. NO.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.696
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE
WITH EVERYTHING--LIME, CHILI.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.654
THANK YOU.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.352
THAT'S GREAT.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.832
KEEP THE CHANGE.

21:08.832 --> 21:13.489
AHH... I'M STARVING.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.012
MMM.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.797
[mouth full] I GUESS YOU
BURN A LOT OF CALORIES,

21:16.797 --> 21:18.189
BEING A NEWLYWED.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.887
[sighs] WE'RE NOT HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.628
IT'S AMAZING.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.933
YOU'D THINK THAT MARRIAGE
WOULD JUST COOL THINGS OFF,

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
BUT FOR US,
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.937
PLEASE STOP TALKING.

21:26.937 --> 21:29.331
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M
THE HAPPIEST I'VE EVER BEEN.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.854
EVERY MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP
NEXT TO HER,

21:30.854 --> 21:32.639
AND EVERY NIGHT WHEN WE GO
TO BED TOGETHER,

21:32.639 --> 21:33.988
I JUST THINK, "WOW, I'M
THE LUCKIEST MAN IN THE WORLD,"

21:33.988 --> 21:35.424
YOU KNOW?

21:35.424 --> 21:37.121
I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.819
SO I WANNA SAY THANK YOU.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.560
'CAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT MADE ME TAKE THE RISK.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.952
AND I'M STARTING
TO REGRET IT.

21:41.952 --> 21:46.217
NO. YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,
AND I OWE YOU.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.871
I'M GONNA FIND YOU
SOMEBODY TO LOVE.

21:47.871 --> 21:50.004
NO. YOU'RE NOT.YES, I AM.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.398
TRUST ME, THERE IS NO POINT
IN GOING THROUGH LIFE ALONE.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.357
[chewing] ARE YOU REALLY
NOT GONNA EAT THAT?

21:56.793 --> 21:59.274
HMM. [smacks lips]

22:02.016 --> 22:04.714
[door opens]

22:04.714 --> 22:06.368
[Lisbon] THANKS.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.025
OH. HELLO.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.070
TERESA.
AGENT VAN PELT.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.420
WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO HERE?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.073
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU CALLED FROST

22:16.073 --> 22:17.597
THE WEEK BEFORE HE KILLED
PARKMAN?

22:17.597 --> 22:20.121
LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.819
I WAS HIRED BY VISUALIZE
TO PROTECT PARKMAN FROM FROST.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.213
BANG-UP JOB.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.476
FROST WAS THREATENING
A WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.043
I FIGURED HE WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR A PAYOUT.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.436
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HIM?

22:30.436 --> 22:32.002
WELL, I TOLD HIM THAT
VISUALIZE'S LAWYERS

22:32.002 --> 22:33.917
WERE BEHIND PARKMAN,
AND THEY'D KEEP IT IN THE COURTS

22:33.917 --> 22:36.572
UNTIL FROST HAD SPENT
HIS LAST PENNY.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.182
WHAT'S WRONG, RAY?

22:38.182 --> 22:39.662
THESE QUESTIONS MAKING YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE?

22:40.968 --> 22:43.231
DO YOU SEE THAT?
IT'S THAT.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.319
IT'S A SPIDER.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.020
I HATE SPIDERS.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.457
BETTER NOW?

22:55.330 --> 22:56.766
LOOK. IT... [chuckles]

22:56.766 --> 22:58.725
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
THAT FROST WAS

22:58.725 --> 23:00.379
PLANNING ANYTHING
LIKE A MURDER.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.511
HE DIDN'T REALLY STRIKE ME
AS THE VIOLENT TYPE.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.819
LIVE AND LEARN, I GUESS.HMM.

23:05.819 --> 23:09.910
SOMETIMES YOU GET IT WRONG.
NEXT TIME YOU DO BETTER.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.129
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW FROST GOT AWAY.

23:12.129 --> 23:15.045
YOU KNOW, THE TRICK THAT
JANE CAN'T FIGURE OUT.AND?

23:15.045 --> 23:17.134
WELL, WE KNOW THERE WAS
A THIRD MAN.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.745
YEAH, THE ONE WHO KILLED FROST.THERE HAD TO BE
A FOURTH AS WELL.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.747
AN INSIDE MAN.AN INSIDE MAN?

23:20.747 --> 23:22.096
OR WOMAN.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.837
A MAID, A COOK, A BELLBOY,
WHATEVER.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.273
SOMEBODY WHO COULD HELP FROST
GET IN AND OUT OF THE HOTEL

23:25.273 --> 23:26.622
WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

23:26.622 --> 23:27.971
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
FROST HAD CONTACT

23:27.971 --> 23:29.756
WITH ANY
OF THE HOTEL'S EMPLOYEES.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.628
WE DID INTERVIEWS.SO? SOMEBODY LIED TO YOU.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.108
THE KILLER COULD HAVE
ALREADY BEEN GONE

23:34.108 --> 23:35.762
BY THE TIME HOTEL SECURITY
GOT TO THE ROOM.

23:35.762 --> 23:36.806
ALL THE WITNESSES SAID
THEY HEARD A STRUGGLE

23:36.806 --> 23:38.460
GOING ON INSIDE THE ROOM.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.680
UH, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HEARING AND SEEING.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.333
AUTOPSY REPORT
JUST CAME OUT.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.814
PARKMAN WASN'T IMMEDIATELY
KILLED FROM THE KNIFE WOUND.

23:44.814 --> 23:48.296
HE DIED FROM A STRUGGLE
SOMETIME AFTER BEING STABBED.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.993
HE HAD AN AORTAL HEMORRHAGE.

23:49.993 --> 23:53.083
SO... [clicks tongue]
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.128
[huffs]

23:57.740 --> 24:00.308
HOW DID YOU GET
THE AUTOPSY BEFORE US?

24:00.308 --> 24:02.484
I STILL HAVE FRIENDS
IN CBI, TERESA.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.225
THEY HELP WHEN I NEED IT.

24:06.662 --> 24:10.492
SPEAKING OF...
HELPING FRIENDS,

24:10.492 --> 24:13.408
A WORD OF ADVICE
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.583
YEAH? WHAT'S THAT?

24:14.583 --> 24:16.455
JANE.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.021
HE'S MADE A MESS OF THINGS.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.893
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.069
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?NO, I DON'T.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.333
THERE'S A LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE
THAT JANE'S PISSED OFF,

24:25.333 --> 24:27.204
NOT JUST RED JOHN.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.598
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WAY,
BOTH OF YOU,

24:29.598 --> 24:32.514
BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPENS.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.385
I REALLY--I'D HATE
TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.039
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
SAY THAT, RAY,

24:36.039 --> 24:37.737
BECAUSE, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE PUTTING YOUR NAME

24:37.737 --> 24:39.826
ON A LIST OF SUSPECTS
FOR PARKMAN'S MURDER.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.610
WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.394
THE THIRD MAN COULD HAVE KILLED
BOTH FROST AND PARKMAN.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.571
[elevator bell dings][sighs] FROST KILLED PARKMAN.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.747
MAYBE THE THIRD MAN JUST
WANTED IT TO LOOK THAT WAY.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.575
MAYBE IT'S YOU, RAY.
MAYBE YOU'RE THE THIRD MAN.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.882
YOU HAVE MOTIVE.[elevator bell dings]

24:52.882 --> 24:54.623
[doors open]

24:56.320 --> 24:58.671
I JUST HOPE
YOU REMEMBER THIS.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.324
THAT I TRIED TO HELP.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.978
OKAY?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.458
[elevator bell dings]

25:05.808 --> 25:07.897
I WANT TO SEE THAT
AUTOPSY REPORT.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.860
THANKS FOR COMING IN,
DETECTIVE CORDERO.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.035
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.428
YEAH. CALL ME OSCAR.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.779
WOW. NICE DIGS YOU GOT HERE.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.433
NO EXPENSE SPARED FOR YOU
CBI FOLKS, HUH?

25:22.433 --> 25:24.305
YEAH. CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING? COFFEE?

25:24.305 --> 25:25.915
NAH, I'M FINE.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.874
HERE'S THE FILE
ON THE KIRKLAND SHOOTING.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.703
IT'S GOT THE PRISON REPORT
PLUS MY INVESTIGATION.

25:30.703 --> 25:31.878
ANYTHING THAT STUCK OUT?[file rustling]

25:31.878 --> 25:33.488
NAH.

25:33.488 --> 25:36.622
ONLY A SICK PUPPY WHO COULDN'T
HACK DOING HIS TIME,

25:36.622 --> 25:39.755
LOOKING FOR ANY WAY OUT...
IN MY OPINION.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.540
AND YOU SPOKE
TO THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

25:41.540 --> 25:43.367
WHO SHOT HIM?OH, YEAH.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.934
HE WAS JUST A KID.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.807
SAYS YOUR GUY KIRKLAND
PAID NO ATTENTION

25:47.807 --> 25:49.286
TO THREE VERBAL WARNINGS,
JUST KEPT GOING,

25:49.286 --> 25:50.723
DIDN'T EVEN TURN AROUND.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.376
KID HAD TO SHOOT.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.770
YOU HATE TO SEE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

25:54.770 --> 25:57.556
SOME PIECE OF CRAP
MAKING A COP DO

25:57.556 --> 25:59.601
WHAT HE AIN'T GOT THE STONES
TO DO HIMSELF.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.907
IT AIN'T RIGHT.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.517
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHIN'.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.127
MESSED THE KID UP
REALLY BAD.

26:04.127 --> 26:07.304
P.T.S.D... OR SOMETHING.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.568
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.961
HMM. CAN I MAKE A COPY
OF THIS?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.572
DON'T NEED TO.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.964
BROUGHT THAT ONE FOR YOU.
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT IT.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.313
THANKS.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.185
HEY, NO PROBLEM.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.580
MAYBE ONE DAY YOU'LL DO
A FAVOR FOR ME, RIGHT?

26:27.455 --> 26:29.022
HE CLEAR THINGS UP?

26:29.022 --> 26:31.285
NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, HE SAYS IT WAS CLEAN.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.026
KIRKLAND WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE,
NOBODY WANTED TO SHOOT HIM,

26:33.026 --> 26:34.505
BUT THEY WERE FORCED TO--
RELUCTANTLY.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.507
YOU DON'T BUY IT.WELL, IT SAYS IN HERE

26:36.507 --> 26:37.813
HE WAS SHOT SIX TIMES
IN THE BACK.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.336
SIX DOESN'T SOUND
SO RELUCTANT.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.599
NO, IT DOESN'T.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.818
THAT'S THE STORY
WE'RE GONNA GET.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.733
OKAY. I'LL TELL THE BOSS.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.005
HI.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.877
UH, WHERE CAN I FIND
KIMBALL CHO?

26:57.877 --> 26:59.922
THAT'S HIS DESK, BUT HE
STEPPED OUT FOR A MOMENT.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.184
CAN I HELP YOU?

27:01.184 --> 27:03.709
MAYBE. I MET HIM
THIS MORNING AT THE GYM.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.798
I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SEE IF HE WANTS TO LET ME

27:05.798 --> 27:07.321
BUY HIM A CUP OF COFFEE.
[chuckles]

27:07.321 --> 27:09.497
PLAN SEEMED NORMAL
WHEN I WAS DRIVING OVER HERE,

27:09.497 --> 27:11.717
BUT NOW IT'S FEELING
A LITTLE STALKER-ISH.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.196
DOES IT SEEM STALKER-ISH
TO YOU?

27:13.196 --> 27:16.025
MM, A LITTLE. YEAH.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.200
OKAY, I SHOULD GO.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.854
HEY.OH.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.769
REMEMBER ME?FROM THE GYM, YEAH.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.989
YEAH. [sighs]COME HERE.
SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.512
OKAY.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.644
THANKS.

27:28.951 --> 27:29.996
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.216
[sighs and giggles]

27:33.216 --> 27:35.566
MY NAME'S KIRA.
KIRA TINSLEY.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.220
I WAS GONNA BUY YOU
A COFFEE,

27:37.220 --> 27:40.093
BUT IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
I'M GONNA GO.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.790
NO, I CAN DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE.
GIVE ME A SECOND.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.188
UH, WHEN PARKMAN WAS STABBED,

27:48.188 --> 27:50.233
THE KNIFE GLANCED
OVER THE RIB

27:50.233 --> 27:52.409
AND BARELY NICKED THE AORTA.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.586
HAFFNER WASN'T LYING.
THERE CORONER SAYS THAT

27:55.586 --> 27:58.285
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE
AFTER THE STABBING

27:58.285 --> 28:00.461
THAT CAUSED THE NICK TO TEAR,
AND THAT'S WHAT STARTED

28:00.461 --> 28:02.376
THE HEMORRHAGING
THAT KILLED PARKMAN.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.117
AH.

28:04.117 --> 28:07.555
AND IF FROST AND PARKMAN
WERE REALLY STRUGGLING

28:07.555 --> 28:09.383
AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
THE HEMORRHAGE,

28:09.383 --> 28:12.952
HOW IS IT THAT FROST DIDN'T GET
PARKMAN'S BLOOD ALL OVER HIM?

28:12.952 --> 28:15.171
HMM.AND HOW DID HE AVOID
TRACKING BLOODY FOOTPRINTS

28:15.171 --> 28:17.086
OUT OF THE ROOM?

28:18.479 --> 28:20.568
[chuckles]JANE?

28:20.568 --> 28:22.222
I JUST SOLVED THE CASE.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.440
REALLY? HOW?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.833
YEAH. ONE SECOND, LISBON.JANE?

28:28.315 --> 28:29.664
GRACE?HMM?

28:29.664 --> 28:31.840
WHO WAS THAT WOMAN
CHO JUST MET WITH?

28:31.840 --> 28:33.537
SOMEONE NAMED KIRA TINSLEY.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.365
OH, THE WOMAN HE MET
AT THE GYM?THAT'S RIGHT.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.758
ATTRACTIVE, RIGHT?

28:36.758 --> 28:39.413
SHE WAS OKAY,
IF YOU LIKE THAT TYPE.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.720
YOU, UH, YOU EVER GO
TO THE GYM, GRACE?SURE.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.243
YOU EVER TRY TO PICK UP
A GUY THERE?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.940
UGH. NO.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.377
UH, DID THEY HAPPEN TO SAY
WHERE THEY WERE GOING?

28:47.377 --> 28:49.336
COFFEE.

28:49.336 --> 28:52.034
NOW YOU JUST WALK OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION?

28:52.034 --> 28:53.949
LISBON, CAN I ASK A FAVOR?WHAT?

28:53.949 --> 28:56.822
CAN YOU GO GET ONE OF THOSE
ELASTIC EXERCISE BANDS,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.475
THE KIND TO HELP YOU
STRETCH WITH?

28:58.475 --> 28:59.650
WHAT DO YOU NEED
ONE OF THOSE FOR?

28:59.650 --> 29:00.956
BRING IT
TO PARKMAN'S HOTEL ROOM.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.088
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.445
OH... CLIENT RELATIONS.
BORING STUFF.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.100
TELL ME MORE ABOUT
THE CBI.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.929
IT'S A JOB.
UH, WE TRY TO HELP PEOPLE,

29:16.929 --> 29:18.452
TRY TO STOP THE BAD GUYS.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.106
YOU DON'T TALK MUCH,
DO YOU?NO.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.108
[laughs] IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.371
I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.GOOD.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.590
HEY, CHO.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.591
HEY.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.115
KIRA TINSLEY, RIGHT?

29:29.115 --> 29:30.507
YEAH.[clicks tongue]

29:30.507 --> 29:32.248
IS THAT YOURS?
THAT LOOKS GOOD. MAY I?

29:32.248 --> 29:34.424
WHAT? OH.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.949
[mouth full]
MMM. NICE MUFFIN.

29:36.949 --> 29:39.778
I THINK THIS IS YOURS.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.303
WHAT IS THAT?

29:43.303 --> 29:45.305
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ONE OF THOSE.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.005
REALLY? BECAUSE I FOUND THAT
UNDER KIMBALL'S DESK

29:50.005 --> 29:51.833
AND I WAS CERTAIN THAT
IT BELONGED TO YOU.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.793
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?BECAUSE IT GOES WITH, UH...

29:54.793 --> 29:56.664
[inhales sharply]

29:56.664 --> 29:58.666
THIS. HERE.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.494
AND HERE'S YOUR WALLET,

30:00.494 --> 30:02.975
AND THAT IDENTIFIES YOU
AS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR,

30:02.975 --> 30:04.063
DOESN'T IT?

30:04.063 --> 30:06.848
YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.242
THAT'S WHY I DON'T TAKE
JOBS LIKE THIS, BUT...

30:09.242 --> 30:12.158
THE CLIENT PAID CASH
UP FRONT, SO...

30:12.158 --> 30:13.855
[clicks tongue]
I'LL TAKE THIS.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.248
NO, YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE.WHAT?

30:15.248 --> 30:16.292
YOU CAN'T--[plops]

30:16.292 --> 30:17.903
[gasps]OOPS.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.992
THAT COST ME 300 BUCKS.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.689
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.517
[sighs]

30:23.517 --> 30:26.737
[huffs]EXCUSE ME A MINUTE. HEY!

30:26.737 --> 30:28.174
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.740
[sighs] LOOK,
IT WAS JUST BUSINESS.

30:29.740 --> 30:32.308
NOTHING PERSONAL, OKAY?YOUR CLIENT--WHO WAS IT?

30:32.308 --> 30:33.875
YOU KNOW I CAN'T REVEAL THAT.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.921
ALL RIGHT, I'M ARRESTING YOU
UNDER SECTION 632.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.879
THAT'S WORTH A YEAR IN JAIL.HEY, WAIT A SECOND!
NO, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

30:37.879 --> 30:40.360
WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT
HERE, RIGHT?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.970
JEEZ.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.929
WHAT WERE YOU HIRED TO DO?

30:43.929 --> 30:46.845
BUG YOUR OFFICE,
GET CLOSE TO YOU.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.369
CLIENT WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU AND YOUR TEAM KNEW.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.850
AND WHO WAS YOUR CLIENT?
WAS IT VISUALIZE?

30:51.850 --> 30:54.330
YEAH.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.941
SO ARE WE GOOD?

30:55.941 --> 30:57.290
ARE YOU VISUALIZE?

30:57.290 --> 30:58.857
NO.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.467
I JUST WORK FOR WHOEVER
HIRES ME.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.685
ARE WE DONE?

31:01.685 --> 31:03.513
YEAH, WE'RE DONE.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.733
LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
A NICE GUY.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.301
UH... NO HARD FEELINGS?

31:14.220 --> 31:16.222
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS HIRED
BY VISUALIZE.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.006
I'M GONNA PUT A TAIL
ON HER.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.008
[mouth full] NO NEED.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.531
I PUT THE BUG IN HER BAG.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.316
WE CAN LISTEN TO HER
WHENEVER WE LIKE.

31:27.711 --> 31:28.712
[clatters]

31:31.237 --> 31:33.065
LET'S GO SOLVE THAT
DOUBLE MURDER, SHALL WE?

31:33.065 --> 31:34.370
RIGHT.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.554
TERESA.[door closes]

31:44.554 --> 31:46.600
ANY IDEA WHY WE'RE HERE?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.950
YOUR MR. JANE ASKED US
TO COME.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.257
OH--ARE YOU GONNA TEACH US
AEROBICS?

31:52.606 --> 31:54.564
JANE WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

31:54.564 --> 31:58.394
SO THE GUN WAS FOUND
SOMEWHERE HERE, RIGHT?

31:58.394 --> 31:59.482
MM-HMM.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.267
AND THE HOTEL IS...

32:01.267 --> 32:02.616
THAT WAY, YES?

32:02.616 --> 32:04.139
RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T SEE IT,

32:04.139 --> 32:06.228
BUT IT'S JUST THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT WALL.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.491
I'M RIGHT.ABOUT WHAT?

32:08.491 --> 32:11.451
UH, YOU STAY HERE WITH RIGSBY,
AND KEEP VERY ALERT.

32:11.451 --> 32:14.019
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
GETTING HURT.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.462
OH. FINALLY. WE'VE BEEN
WAITING HERE LONG ENOUGH.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.507
ALL GOOD THINGS COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.074
THANK YOU.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.642
YOU GONNA SOLVE THE CASE NOW
WITH A STRETCHY BAND?

32:28.642 --> 32:31.993
YES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
[sighs]

32:31.993 --> 32:33.995
THE FIRST THING THAT'S
IMPORTANT TO NOTE

32:33.995 --> 32:35.954
IS THAT PARKMAN AND FROST
WERE LOVERS.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.607
THANK YOU.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.609
NO, THEY WEREN'T.YES, THEY WERE.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.307
WE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

32:41.307 --> 32:43.265
NO. BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP
STARTED

32:43.265 --> 32:45.224
WHEN PARKMAN WAS FROST'S COACH.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.008
WHEN FROST WAS STILL A MINOR.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.271
AND I NEVER FELT
I HAD TO WORRY

32:49.271 --> 32:51.360
ABOUT HIM BEING ALONE
WITH HER.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.927
LIKE I SAID, PARKMAN WAS
FROST'S MENTOR

32:52.927 --> 32:54.320
SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.974
AND CONTINUED
TO THE PRESENT DAY?

32:55.974 --> 32:59.586
YES. THEN THE RELATIONSHIP
STARTED GOING BADLY.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.197
WHEN PARKMAN WENT TO EUROPE,
THAT WAS THE FINAL STRAW.

33:02.197 --> 33:06.158
MYLAR THOUGHT FROST
WAS SNEAKING AWAY

33:06.158 --> 33:08.029
WHEN PARKMAN WASN'T LOOKING.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.857
PARKMAN WENT TO A GYMNASTICS
TOURNAMENT IN EUROPE.

33:09.857 --> 33:10.727
IN THE PAST,
FROST WENT WITH HIM.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.381
THIS TIME, HE DIDN'T.

33:12.381 --> 33:15.863
HE HAD IT BACKWARDS.
PARKMAN HADN'T INVITED FROST.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.083
SO HE ASSUMED THAT HE WAS
BEING REPLACED

33:18.083 --> 33:19.998
WITH A YOUNGER LOVER...
[inhales]

33:19.998 --> 33:22.043
AND DECIDED TO SEEK REVENGE.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.872
SO HE TRIED FILING
A WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT,

33:24.872 --> 33:28.267
BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF BEING
INTIMIDATED BY VISUALIZE.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.706
SO HE TRIED THE HARD TOUCH,

33:32.706 --> 33:34.882
WHEN PARKMAN CAME TO THE HOTEL
FOR THE CONFERENCE.

33:34.882 --> 33:38.581
NOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP HAD
ALWAYS BEEN A CONSENSUAL ONE,

33:38.581 --> 33:41.062
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MATTER
IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC

33:41.062 --> 33:42.672
OR THE LAW.

33:42.672 --> 33:45.066
IT WAS IN FROST'S POWER
TO TRANSFORM PARKMAN

33:45.066 --> 33:48.200
FROM A--AN OLYMPIC COACH
TO A CHILD MOLESTER

33:48.200 --> 33:50.028
WITH JUST A FEW WORDS.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.378
HE DEMANDED THAT PARKMAN
BRING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY

33:52.378 --> 33:54.467
ACROSS THE PARK
IN A BROWN PAPER BAG.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.513
[Lisbon] OR FROST WOULD RUIN
PARKMAN'S LIFE FOREVER.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.559
[Patrick] AND FROST WAS RIGHT
IN HIS ESTIMATION

33:59.559 --> 34:02.562
OF WHAT PARKMAN STOOD TO LOSE.

34:02.562 --> 34:05.565
WHAT HE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS
HOW PARKMAN WOULD REACT.

34:08.307 --> 34:11.397
[silenced gunshot] [gasp]

34:11.397 --> 34:13.877
[Patrick] THE SODA BOTTLE
SILENCER WORKED PERFECTLY.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.184
EVEN IF IT DID BLOW OFF,
NO ONE HEARD A THING.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.926
BUT, UH, PARKMAN HADN'T
EXPECTED

34:18.926 --> 34:20.884
THAT FROST
WOULD HAVE A KNIFE.

34:20.884 --> 34:23.278
[Lisbon] THE WOUND
LOOKED TO BE MINOR,

34:23.278 --> 34:25.411
SO PARKMAN PUT HIS GUN
BACK IN HIS BAG

34:25.411 --> 34:26.803
AND HE LEFT FROST.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.589
ALREADY PARKMAN WAS
STARTING TO PANIC.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.244
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CAR
HADN'T GONE TO PLAN.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.681
NOTHING WAS GOING
TO PLAN.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.292
[speaks indistinctly] WHOA! WHAT THE HECK!

34:37.292 --> 34:39.903
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED,
PARKMAN WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

34:39.903 --> 34:42.036
WHAT TO DO WITH THE GUN.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.690
THE WINDOW WAS HIS ONLY CHANCE.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.474
HE COULDN'T JUST THROW IT
OUT THERE, THOUGH.

34:45.474 --> 34:48.912
IT WOULD END UP
RIGHT DOWN THERE IN THE STREET.

34:48.912 --> 34:52.699
BUT... IF HE COULD JUST

34:52.699 --> 34:54.440
GET IT...

34:54.440 --> 34:57.095
A LITTLE... FURTHER.

34:58.444 --> 35:00.707
JUST THAT LITTLE...

35:00.707 --> 35:02.709
BIT...

35:02.709 --> 35:04.102
FURTHER.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.323
[grunting]

35:08.323 --> 35:11.109
[whooshes, window shatters,
gun clatters on ground]

35:11.109 --> 35:13.676
WHAT THE HELL?

35:13.676 --> 35:15.287
[Lisbon] WHEN THE GUN LANDED
ON THE GROUND

35:15.287 --> 35:16.984
IN THE ALLEY, IT WENT OFF.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.421
THAT WAS THE GUNSHOT
THAT WITNESSES HEARD.

35:20.814 --> 35:23.382
VERY LIKELY WE'LL FIND
A BULLET HOLE

35:23.382 --> 35:25.775
SOMEWHERE IN THE ALLEY.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.604
BUT WHO KILLED PARKMAN?
WHERE'D ALL THE BLOOD COME FROM?

35:28.604 --> 35:31.999
UH, WHEN PARKMAN
PULLED ON THE ELASTIC...[crunches]

35:31.999 --> 35:34.393
HIS AORTA--IT RUPTURED.

35:37.091 --> 35:38.223
[groans]

35:38.223 --> 35:41.791
[whooshes] [lamp clatters]

35:41.791 --> 35:43.141
FORE!

35:43.141 --> 35:45.839
[thud]

35:50.931 --> 35:52.672
[weakly] HELP.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.763
HE STABBED ME.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.682
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT NOBODY
CAME IN OR OUT OF THE ROOM.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.858
IT WAS JUST MR. PARKMAN
THE WHOLE TIME?

36:04.858 --> 36:06.425
[mouth full] YEAH.

36:06.425 --> 36:08.035
THE TRICK WAS
THAT THERE WAS NO TRICK.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.431
ET VOILà.

36:17.827 --> 36:21.614
GOOD-BYE, AGENT LISBON,
MR. JANE.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.007
I HOPE YOU WON'T BE
INSULTED WHEN I SAY

36:24.007 --> 36:26.096
THAT I HOPE I WON'T BE
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.837
OH, WE WON'T BE.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.362
I'M SURE MR. HAFFNER WOULD
SAY THANK YOU IF HE WERE HERE.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.146
WHERE IS HE?
