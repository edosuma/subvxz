01:05.406 --> 01:06.808
You gotta look calm.

01:07.541 --> 01:08.640
Answer their questions,

01:08.642 --> 01:10.077
but don't tell 'em
nothin' extra.

01:11.244 --> 01:12.977
Keep your hands

Now, one day,
y'all gonna be with me,

01:25.359 --> 01:27.461
and you best bet
we gonna get pulled over.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.762
That don't mean
I did somethin' wrong.

01:31.764 --> 01:33.298
Maybe I made
a mistake driving

01:33.300 --> 01:35.036
or maybe I ain't do
nothin' at all.

01:38.271 --> 01:40.741
You gonna see me
with my hands like this.

01:41.574 --> 01:42.976
On the dashboard.

01:44.812 --> 01:45.747
Come on.

01:54.354 --> 01:55.854
Now, you keep
your hands posted

01:55.856 --> 01:58.557
'cause moving makes
the police get all nervous.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.862
If I ain't with you,
you ask for me.

02:02.630 --> 02:05.098
It can get real dangerous,
so don't argue with them...

02:05.999 --> 02:08.401
but keep your hands
where they can see 'em.

02:09.301 --> 02:10.704
This how you gonna act.

02:12.473 --> 02:13.641

Now, just because we gotta
deal with this mess...

02:26.954 --> 02:29.420
don't you ever forget
that being black is a honor

02:29.422 --> 02:30.957

Imma quiz you.

02:48.575 --> 02:50.011
Really, Maverick?

02:55.883 --> 02:56.918

everywhere again!

03:53.206 --> 03:54.509
And, boy, wipe that seat.

03:55.776 --> 03:58.143
<i>Mama and Daddy had me
when they were 17.</i>

03:58.145 --> 04:01.079
<i>My nana even threw Mama
out the house.</i>

04:01.081 --> 04:02.715
<i>Said Daddy was no good...</i>

04:02.717 --> 04:04.549
<i>just a pusher
for the King Lords gang.</i>

04:04.551 --> 04:06.117
- Hey, baby.
- You seen my wallet?

04:06.119 --> 04:08.119
- Yeah, I put it on the dresser.
- I can't find it.

04:08.121 --> 04:10.254
Well, I know it's there, baby.
I put it there.

04:10.256 --> 04:11.656
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:11.658 --> 04:13.591
<i>She swore raising
the dead was more likely</i>

04:13.593 --> 04:15.226
<i>than Mama and Daddy making it.</i>

04:15.228 --> 04:16.127
Mama...

04:17.832 --> 04:20.599
<i>They stay proving her
and everybody else wrong.</i>

04:20.601 --> 04:22.501
<i>And in large part,
that means making sure</i>

04:22.503 --> 04:24.169
<i>that we don't make
the same mistakes.</i>

04:24.171 --> 04:25.371
You know what?

04:25.373 --> 04:26.672
Why don't you just sit
your cute butt down

04:26.674 --> 04:28.340
and let me do what I do. Okay?

04:28.342 --> 04:29.573
Oh, really?

04:29.575 --> 04:31.011
You gonna let me do what I do?

04:31.779 --> 04:33.014
Ain't they too old for that?

04:33.914 --> 04:35.049
Boy...

04:36.416 --> 04:37.883
- Good morning, y'all.
- Good morning.

04:37.885 --> 04:39.684
<i>Their cuteness
can be extra</i>,

04:39.686 --> 04:41.886
<i>but they're adorable.</i>

04:41.888 --> 04:43.188
I love you.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.088
I love you.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.155
<i>I can't even lie.</i>

04:45.157 --> 04:46.290
<i>They're my OTP.</i>

04:46.292 --> 04:47.961
<i>One true pairing.</i>

04:52.198 --> 04:54.301
<i>Mama and Daddy were born
in Garden Heights.</i>

04:58.171 --> 05:00.908
<i>Their first kiss was
in the Haven Acres Projects.</i>

05:04.443 --> 05:06.046
<i>Daddy says our life is here.</i>

05:06.947 --> 05:08.716
<i>'Cause our people are here.</i>

05:10.650 --> 05:12.551
<i>We got
Mr. Reuben's barbecue...</i>

05:14.253 --> 05:16.022
<i>...Mr. Lewis's barbershop...</i>

05:17.424 --> 05:19.726
<i>...a Walmart
32 minutes away...</i>

05:20.561 --> 05:22.229
<i>and Daddy's store.</i>

05:23.130 --> 05:25.929
<i>Carter's Grocery is
where you get your milk,</i>

05:25.931 --> 05:28.633
<i>Newport shorts, Hot Cheetos,</i>

05:28.635 --> 05:30.135
<i>hot gossip,</i>

05:30.137 --> 05:32.940
<i>and anything else that
you might need in a hurry.</i>

05:34.007 --> 05:36.043
<i>Mama thinks
Daddy is scared of change.</i>

05:37.743 --> 05:40.412
<i>She left the Garden
when she was a little girl.</i>

05:40.414 --> 05:42.216
<i>And she wants us
to get out too.</i>

05:43.517 --> 05:45.686
<i>Either way,
you gotta stay ready.</i>

05:47.020 --> 05:49.724
<i>'Cause Garden Heights is
always gonna be ready for you.</i>

05:51.125 --> 05:53.292
Seven? Now, are you staying
at your mama's house

05:53.294 --> 05:54.493
or with us tonight?

05:54.495 --> 05:57.528
At Mama's.
As long as King ain't there.

05:57.530 --> 05:58.965
<i>And then there's King.</i>

06:01.368 --> 06:02.969
<i>He runs the King Lords.</i>

06:05.604 --> 06:07.874
<i>My dad used to be
his right-hand man.</i>

06:09.943 --> 06:11.710
<i>The high school is where you go...</i>

06:11.712 --> 06:15.681
<i>...to get jumped, high,
pregnant, or killed.</i>

06:15.683 --> 06:17.082
<i>We don't go there.</i>

06:17.084 --> 06:19.153
<i>Not since what happened
to my friend Natasha.</i>

06:20.887 --> 06:23.587
<i>So Mama sent us
to another school</i>

06:23.589 --> 06:25.325
<i>where everyone's
college-bound.</i>

06:27.128 --> 06:28.727
- Sekani?
- Yeah?

06:28.729 --> 06:31.028
Baby, remind me
what your name means again.

06:31.030 --> 06:31.828
Joy!

06:31.830 --> 06:33.198
Yes! So that means I want you

06:33.200 --> 06:34.866
to be just as big
a joy at school

06:34.868 --> 06:36.434
as you are
at home, okay?

06:36.436 --> 06:37.568
Okay!

06:37.570 --> 06:39.470
But less loud!

06:39.472 --> 06:41.439
Why you yelling?

06:43.443 --> 06:44.775
You guys
have a good day.

06:44.777 --> 06:46.813
- Love you, Mommy!
- I love you too, Sekani.

06:52.118 --> 06:54.318
<i>Garden Heights
is one world.</i>

06:54.320 --> 06:55.789
<i>Williamson is another.</i>

06:56.623 --> 06:58.756
<i>And I gotta keep it separate.</i>

06:58.758 --> 07:02.062
<i>So when I'm here,
I'm Starr Version Two.</i>

07:08.501 --> 07:09.967
- See you later, bro.
- Peace out.

07:09.969 --> 07:12.737
<i>That means flipping
a switch in my brain.</i>

07:12.739 --> 07:14.840
<i>Williamson Starr
doesn't use slang.</i>

07:14.842 --> 07:17.109
<i>If a rapper would say it,
she doesn't.</i>

07:17.111 --> 07:18.977
<i>Even if her white friends do.</i>

07:18.979 --> 07:20.578
Hey, boo.

07:20.580 --> 07:22.414
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good, girl.

07:22.416 --> 07:25.816
<i>Slang makes them cool.
Slang makes me "hood."</i>

07:25.818 --> 07:28.619
Yo! Those kicks are lit!

07:28.621 --> 07:30.157
Thanks. Space Jams.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.196
<i>Williamson Starr
is approachable.</i>

07:36.128 --> 07:38.063
<i>No stank eyes
or yelling because</i>

07:38.065 --> 07:40.935
<i>Williamson Starr
is non-confrontational.</i>

07:45.205 --> 07:48.472
<i>Basically, Williamson Starr
doesn't give anyone a reason</i>

07:48.474 --> 07:49.510
<i>to call her ghetto.</i>

07:52.979 --> 07:55.114
<i>And I hate myself
for doing it.</i>

07:56.750 --> 07:59.049
Let me at him.
I'll kick his ass.

07:59.051 --> 08:00.986
Hailey, you're violent.

08:00.988 --> 08:02.554
Uh, okay.
If someone tries to do

08:02.556 --> 08:04.121
some shit to my girl,
I have to get him.

08:04.123 --> 08:05.691
I'm serious, Starr.
I will go after him.

08:05.693 --> 08:06.857
I will kick his ass.

08:06.859 --> 08:08.325
I do not care.
You just say the word.

08:08.327 --> 08:10.361
<i>Hailey must've watched</i>
Straight Outta Compton

08:10.363 --> 08:11.362
<i>again last night.</i>

08:11.364 --> 08:12.898
You just say the word,
and I'm gonna do it.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.299
What did you say to him?

08:15.301 --> 08:18.102
We're not really talking
right now, so...

08:18.104 --> 08:20.003
Who's not really talking
to whom?

08:20.005 --> 08:22.107
Well, Chris lured Starr
over to his house

08:22.109 --> 08:24.475
and sprung a condom on her.

08:24.477 --> 08:25.609
What did you say?

08:25.611 --> 08:27.445
No, no, no.
What did you do?

08:27.447 --> 08:28.513
What size was it?

08:28.515 --> 08:30.416
Maya! Oh, my God!

08:31.150 --> 08:32.649
You're on a "need to know."

08:32.650 --> 08:34.051
Okay! And I need to know.

08:34.053 --> 08:37.624
Look, Chris is great,
but I'm just not ready.

08:38.424 --> 08:40.991
And eventually, I'll get there,
but he just assumed.

08:40.994 --> 08:42.860
Assuming. Punishable by death.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.297
So, you're gonna
Taylor Swift this?

08:45.299 --> 08:46.230
She doesn't even rank

08:46.232 --> 08:47.632
on the angry girlfriend
scale anymore.

08:47.634 --> 08:50.668
Nah. I'm gonna
Beyonce his ass.

08:52.606 --> 08:53.540
Watch.

08:57.645 --> 09:00.814

Nuh-uh. Nope.

10:01.307 --> 10:03.077
I don't like
what you did the other day.

10:05.746 --> 10:07.380
Starr, I'm sorry.

10:08.114 --> 10:11.016
- I messed up. Bad.
- Mm-hmm.

10:11.018 --> 10:12.883
But I keep thinking
that we're getting closer...

10:12.885 --> 10:14.018
and ask to take you out
on Saturday,

10:14.020 --> 10:15.387
and you don't say yes.

10:15.389 --> 10:16.753
- I'm busy.
- Right.

10:16.755 --> 10:18.223
Every time?

10:18.225 --> 10:20.258
So I figure maybe you want me
to meet your parents first.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.860
But whenever I ask to
come over, you never say yes.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.297
They're busy too.

10:25.031 --> 10:27.300
Well, it seems like
everyone's busy, Starr.

10:28.401 --> 10:31.503
So then I think, "How do I get
closer to my own girlfriend?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.305
Maybe she wants to skip
the whole flowers

10:33.307 --> 10:35.239
and chocolate part
and just get right to it."

10:35.241 --> 10:37.942
Chris, you are acting
a damn fool,

10:37.944 --> 10:39.511
if you think I'm one
of these little thirsty girls

10:39.513 --> 10:40.945
running around here
that you can hit.

10:40.947 --> 10:42.247
Starr, you're not.

10:42.249 --> 10:44.715
You're way more important
than that to me, okay.

10:44.717 --> 10:46.350
We've been dating
for almost six months.

10:46.352 --> 10:47.853
And if you can't tell that
by now,

10:47.855 --> 10:49.356
then I don't know what else
you want me to say.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.291
Other than I miss you.

10:52.324 --> 10:53.459
A lot.

10:56.696 --> 10:57.932
I made that beat for you.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.200
Come on.
You gotta tell me that's fire.

11:04.202 --> 11:06.204
It's a'ight.

11:06.206 --> 11:08.672
I wanna hear you say it.

11:08.674 --> 11:09.740
It's okay.

11:09.742 --> 11:11.909
Wow. Okay.

11:11.911 --> 11:13.546
I guess that means
I gotta test it.

11:22.956 --> 11:24.189
<i>I'm fully aware</i>

11:24.191 --> 11:25.623
<i>that some people
would accuse him</i>

11:25.625 --> 11:26.557
<i>of acting black,</i>

11:26.559 --> 11:28.728
<i>but this is just Chris.</i>

11:32.631 --> 11:34.099
<i>And he makes me laugh.</i>

11:34.101 --> 11:36.669
Hey! Get it, man!

11:38.938 --> 11:40.739
Oh, my God.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.476
Don't spin. Come on.

11:48.816 --> 11:50.050
Do you forgive me now?

11:52.351 --> 11:53.286
Yeah.

12:01.961 --> 12:03.594
<i>We get the questions.</i>

12:03.596 --> 12:04.798
<i>Why is he dating her?</i>

12:05.531 --> 12:08.134
<i>On the real, I sometimes
wonder the same thing.</i>

12:10.770 --> 12:14.504
<i>Now, the stares usually come
from the rich white girls.</i>

12:14.506 --> 12:16.907
<i>But they're way too scared
to actually</i>

12:16.909 --> 12:18.444
<i>say anything
to our faces.</i>

12:22.848 --> 12:24.417
Let me take you somewhere
on Saturday.

12:26.119 --> 12:27.254
To do what?

12:28.621 --> 12:30.187
We can eat burgers.

12:30.189 --> 12:31.922
I let you beat me
in foosball...

12:31.924 --> 12:33.891
Let me beat you?

12:33.893 --> 12:34.959
- Mm-hmm.
- And then we can kiss

12:34.961 --> 12:36.226
on a Ferris wheel.

12:36.228 --> 12:37.729
That is so cheesy.

12:37.731 --> 12:39.529
That's what I got.

12:39.531 --> 12:43.167
Okay. But can we do
Sunday instead?

12:43.169 --> 12:44.371
I'll pick you up?

12:45.105 --> 12:46.604
I'll meet you.

12:46.606 --> 12:47.538
Augustine's?

12:47.540 --> 12:50.340
Mm-hmm. Three o'clock?

12:50.342 --> 12:53.945
So romantic.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.747
You are a fool.

12:55.749 --> 12:56.784

Yeah, dressed like that,
got folks thinking

14:16.362 --> 14:17.896
you're my girlfriend.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.596
Kenya, if I had known

14:19.598 --> 14:21.398
following you to this party
meant that I would be

14:21.400 --> 14:23.067
on some <i>Extreme Makeover</i>
Starr Edition mess,

14:23.069 --> 14:24.234
I would've stayed home

14:24.236 --> 14:25.569
and watched
my <i>Fresh Prince</i> reruns.

14:25.571 --> 14:28.606
Oh, girl, you got to let
the 90s perish.

14:32.745 --> 14:34.244
What now?

14:34.246 --> 14:36.379
There go that trick, Denasia.

14:36.381 --> 14:38.382
Ooh, I can't stand her ass.

Always talking smack
about how I'm trying

14:39.852 --> 14:40.984
to steal her ugly-ass man.

14:40.986 --> 14:41.921
Oh, for real?

14:47.159 --> 14:49.393
Man, you so lucky you go

14:49.395 --> 14:50.728
You don't gotta deal

14:50.730 --> 14:52.797
No. There's hoes
at my school, too.

15:08.079 --> 15:09.747
- Don't even!
- Don't even what?

15:09.749 --> 15:11.916
You only brought me here
to tag team a bitch?

15:11.918 --> 15:13.350
Ain't like you had
shit else to do.

15:13.352 --> 15:14.886

Now, you know

15:27.199 --> 15:29.332

15:29.334 --> 15:30.433
We ain't sisters.

15:30.435 --> 15:31.502
Yeah, just 'cause my mama

15:31.504 --> 15:32.769
and her daddy made Seven,

15:32.771 --> 15:33.772

17:56.448 --> 17:58.083
Yeah, she's taking chemo.

17:58.817 --> 18:00.417
But really the only thing
she's worried about

18:00.419 --> 18:02.553
is putting the wig

18:02.555 --> 18:05.124

19:58.138 --> 19:59.369
Oh, old stuff?

19:59.371 --> 20:00.638
You better get up
out my car with that.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.240
Tupac is the truth.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.640
Yeah, 20 years ago.

20:03.642 --> 20:05.778
No, even still, right now.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.045
Listen, let me
tell you something.

20:09.047 --> 20:11.682
Pac said, THUG LIFE means

20:11.684 --> 20:14.955
"The Hate U Give Little Infants
Fucks Everybody."

20:17.858 --> 20:20.193
T-H-U-G-L-I-F-E.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.562
Meaning what?

20:22.762 --> 20:25.562
Meaning what society gives
to us when we little

20:25.564 --> 20:26.930
comes back to bite them
in the ass

20:26.932 --> 20:29.134
when we grow up,
and we wild out.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.540
You get that?

20:34.841 --> 20:35.842
Damn. Yeah.

20:39.746 --> 20:41.614
Pac's gonna
always be relevant.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.753
So you gonna tell me why
you really been busy, Khalil?

20:49.788 --> 20:52.224
Because that McJob that I had
didn't make nothin' happen.

20:53.892 --> 20:55.792
And plus grandma got fired
from the hospital

20:55.794 --> 20:57.761
when they found out
she was sick.

20:57.763 --> 20:59.966
Damn, that's messed up, K,
for real.

21:01.199 --> 21:02.701
You know, we got needs.

21:04.203 --> 21:05.269
If you selling that stuff...

21:05.271 --> 21:06.436
Hey, come on now.

21:06.438 --> 21:08.275
Mind your business,
Starr-Starr.

21:09.307 --> 21:10.309
Don't worry about me.

21:12.512 --> 21:13.947
I'm doing what I gotta do.

21:15.648 --> 21:17.650
Man, you piss me off
sometimes.

21:18.685 --> 21:20.587
Oh, yeah?
So you pissed off right now?

21:21.320 --> 21:22.355
Yeah.

21:23.089 --> 21:24.722
You don't really look
too pissed off.

21:24.724 --> 21:27.090
So, you know, I couldn't tell
if you was pissed off.

21:27.092 --> 21:29.259
I'm really mad at you.

She's good.

22:01.294 --> 22:02.592
Cool.

22:02.594 --> 22:04.730
So, why are we stopped?

22:05.663 --> 22:07.263
Because I wanna look
at you in your eyes

22:07.265 --> 22:08.398
when I'm talking to you.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.035
- Somethin' wrong with that?
- Hmm.

22:13.305 --> 22:15.339
Not inherently, no.

22:15.341 --> 22:18.141
Not inherently.

22:18.143 --> 22:20.276
- Not inherently.
- What?

22:20.278 --> 22:21.714
That school got you messed up.

22:23.515 --> 22:26.050
I saw you out there
one time, too.

22:26.052 --> 22:27.318
When?

22:27.320 --> 22:29.619
Y'all was headed there.
You had your little skirt on.

22:29.621 --> 22:31.856
Your knee-highs.
Your backpack.

22:31.858 --> 22:33.757
You was ready.

22:33.759 --> 22:35.391
What do you mean
you saw me one time?

22:35.393 --> 22:36.627
So you stalking me now?

22:36.629 --> 22:37.897
Whoa, now.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.531
No.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.168
I just like seeing you.
That's all.

22:45.036 --> 22:47.003
We used to see each other
damn near every day

22:47.005 --> 22:48.975
- when we was kids.
- Yeah.

22:49.809 --> 22:52.142
Do you remember when
we used to play Harry Potter?

22:52.144 --> 22:53.878
Yeah.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.781
What did we call ourselves?
Uh...

22:56.783 --> 22:58.581
- The Hood Trio.
- The Hood Trio.

23:00.151 --> 23:03.855
We were some badass
10-year-old wizards.

23:03.857 --> 23:05.421
Bad.

23:05.423 --> 23:06.757
You still have your wand?

23:06.759 --> 23:08.661
Hell, no.
I ain't got that wand.

23:11.296 --> 23:12.696
I don't have the wand.

23:12.698 --> 23:13.997
I know you still have it.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.299
I don't have it.
I threw it away

23:15.301 --> 23:16.766
because you would never
let me be Harry.

23:16.768 --> 23:19.236
- Because you were Ron!
- But I was really Harry.

23:19.238 --> 23:21.138
No. I was Harry.

23:21.140 --> 23:23.810
You were Ron.
Natasha was Hermione.

23:26.144 --> 23:27.079
Okay.

23:28.247 --> 23:29.748
So that first kiss we had?

23:30.650 --> 23:32.715
In the church basement.
Mm-hmm.

23:32.717 --> 23:33.884
Yep.

23:33.886 --> 23:35.988
Man, we were some heathens.

23:36.988 --> 23:40.259
So you telling me that
I was kissing Harry Potter?

23:42.027 --> 23:42.961
Yeah.

23:43.763 --> 23:45.130
Yeah, you were.

23:47.365 --> 23:48.901
All right.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.938
So who am I kissing right now?

24:06.619 --> 24:07.754
Khalil, I...

24:11.223 --> 24:12.726
I got a boyfriend.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.868
Yeah, I heard.

24:26.438 --> 24:28.341
I didn't wanna hear.

24:31.276 --> 24:32.312
But it's all good.

24:34.679 --> 24:35.814
Really?

24:37.883 --> 24:39.952
We've been together
our whole lives, Starr.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.255
We got time.

24:46.525 --> 24:47.459
All right?

<i>Eight-Charlie, Fourteenth and Third.</i>

25:25.331 --> 25:26.265
Damn.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.301
Khalil, put your hands
on the dash

25:30.303 --> 25:31.437
where he can see them.

25:32.504 --> 25:34.271
Khalil, put your hands
on the dash! I'm not playing.

25:34.273 --> 25:36.706
Starr, we ain't done nothing.
What'd we drive, like 50 feet?

25:36.708 --> 25:37.910
Please.

25:38.811 --> 25:40.244
Please. Just do it.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.214
Okay.

25:46.252 --> 25:48.252
Sir, can you roll
your window down for me?

25:48.254 --> 25:49.188
Here we go.

25:52.492 --> 25:54.891
I need to see your driver's
license and registration.

25:54.893 --> 25:56.059
For what? What'd I do?

25:56.061 --> 25:57.694
Sir, license and registration.

25:57.696 --> 25:59.763
Khalil, keep your hands
on the dash.

25:59.765 --> 26:01.231
Starr, how am I supposed
to get him my license

26:01.233 --> 26:02.966
and registration
if I have to stay still?

26:02.968 --> 26:04.534
I wanna know
why you pulling me over.

26:04.536 --> 26:06.102
You failed to signal
a lane change.

26:06.104 --> 26:07.571
- Come on.
- Turn the music off.

26:07.573 --> 26:08.737
Why? I can hear you.

26:08.739 --> 26:10.907
- Please, Khalil!
- Turn it off.

26:10.909 --> 26:12.576
This is my car.
So how can you tell me...

26:12.578 --> 26:13.811
Step out of the car.

26:13.813 --> 26:15.178
You ain't got no right
to do this to me.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.446
Listen, I'm giving
you a lawful order.

26:16.448 --> 26:17.513
Khalil, listen to him.

26:17.515 --> 26:19.082
Is it for failing to signal
my lane change

26:19.084 --> 26:20.783
or for failing to turn down
my music? Which one?

26:20.785 --> 26:22.419
Sir, out of the car, now!

26:22.421 --> 26:24.120
Either you get out
of the car yourself,

26:24.122 --> 26:25.789
or I'm gonna do it for you.

26:25.791 --> 26:26.960
Now!

26:35.434 --> 26:36.402
Drop the phone!

26:37.236 --> 26:38.834
Yo, why don't you
just give me my ticket?

26:38.836 --> 26:41.271
Hands on the car.
Anything on you?

26:41.273 --> 26:42.906
No, there's nothing on me.

26:42.908 --> 26:44.644
- Any drugs?
- Nah, man.

26:45.445 --> 26:47.313
Can you remove
your driver's license, please?

26:48.781 --> 26:50.446
- Where'd you find her?
- I know her.

26:50.448 --> 26:51.484
That's my friend.

26:56.121 --> 26:57.387
You looking
for a score tonight?

26:57.389 --> 26:59.625
What? A score?
Yo, come on, man.

27:00.392 --> 27:02.661
Keep your hands
on the car. Do not move.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.436
Can I get a license run on...

27:12.438 --> 27:14.073
Shit.

27:15.408 --> 27:16.342
Where's my phone?

27:17.642 --> 27:18.577
Shit!

27:19.646 --> 27:21.044
Starr, you okay?

27:21.046 --> 27:22.579
- You all right?
- Go back where he told you.

27:22.581 --> 27:24.814
He gonna take his time
doing whatever he gotta do.

27:24.816 --> 27:26.349
I'm not playing. Go back.

27:26.351 --> 27:29.119
Yo, but come on!
Why you messing up my car?

27:29.121 --> 27:32.492
- Just listen to him, Khalil!
- Okay! All right, chill.

27:43.201 --> 27:46.102
Stop right there! Stop!

27:46.104 --> 27:48.338
- Do not move.
- No. No.

27:48.340 --> 27:51.209
No.

27:52.644 --> 27:53.776
No, Khalil.

27:53.778 --> 27:55.047
Be quiet, ma'am.

27:56.881 --> 27:58.282
You sit down.

27:58.284 --> 28:00.417
No.

28:00.419 --> 28:02.419
Officer needs help.
Shots fired.

28:02.421 --> 28:05.222
One suspect down.
The other in custody.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.357
Requesting an ambulance.

28:06.359 --> 28:09.327
What did you do?

28:09.329 --> 28:10.394
What did you do?

28:10.396 --> 28:12.130
Be quiet, ma'am.

28:13.232 --> 28:14.464
Help him!

28:14.466 --> 28:16.434
I want you to stay where
you are! Do not move, okay?

28:16.436 --> 28:18.601
He's bleeding!
Help him! Come on!

28:18.603 --> 28:20.170
He's bleeding!

28:20.172 --> 28:22.173
Where is it?
Where's the weapon?

28:22.175 --> 28:24.608
Okay? The gun! Where is it?

28:24.610 --> 28:26.376
What gun?

28:26.378 --> 28:27.110
Where...

28:35.754 --> 28:36.723
Shit!

28:37.456 --> 28:39.055
- Khalil!
- Shit! Shit!

28:39.057 --> 28:41.491
Khalil, look at me!
Come on, look at me, Khalil.

28:41.493 --> 28:44.528
Come on, look at me!
Look at me, come on!

28:44.530 --> 28:47.433
Khalil, come on, look at me!

28:48.534 --> 28:50.501
I'm right here.
You're okay, all right?

28:50.503 --> 28:52.401
There's a ambulance coming.
Can you hear it?

28:52.403 --> 28:53.904
It's coming.
It's gonna take care of you.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.105
You're gonna be fine,
all right?

28:55.107 --> 28:57.874
You're gonna be okay.
Don't be scared.

28:57.876 --> 29:00.109
Come on, look at me!

29:00.111 --> 29:02.481
Look at me, Khalil.
Come on!

29:14.360 --> 29:15.727
Breathe, Starr.

29:17.728 --> 29:19.698
Starr, breathe.

29:27.005 --> 29:28.507
Who did that, man?

29:30.243 --> 29:32.609
The officer who did it...

29:32.611 --> 29:34.112
I understand that. I know.

29:37.916 --> 29:40.116
I'm Detective Gomez.

29:40.118 --> 29:43.219
And this is my partner,
Detective Wilkes.

29:43.221 --> 29:45.257
Uh, Lisa Carter.
I'm her mother.

29:46.691 --> 29:48.093
Starr Carter.

29:50.294 --> 29:52.532
Can you tell us
what happened tonight, Starr?

29:59.037 --> 30:00.772
I went to this party.

30:01.939 --> 30:03.743
And Khalil was there, too.

30:04.944 --> 30:06.976
Why was Khalil there?

30:06.978 --> 30:08.878
Same as everybody else,
I guess.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.580
Just recreational purposes.

30:10.582 --> 30:12.749
Witnesses at the party stated
that there was

30:12.751 --> 30:14.984
an altercation and gunshots.

30:14.986 --> 30:17.223
Did Khalil have
anything to do with it?

30:18.323 --> 30:19.156
Nah.

30:19.158 --> 30:22.024
I mean... no.

30:22.026 --> 30:25.061
We were, uh, just talking...

30:25.063 --> 30:26.830
when the fight broke out.

30:26.832 --> 30:28.565
He offered to take me home

30:28.567 --> 30:31.702
because he wanted to make sure
that I got home safely.

30:32.470 --> 30:36.775
And that's when 115
pulled us over for no reason.

30:37.709 --> 30:38.876
Who?

30:38.878 --> 30:39.879
The officer.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.913
That's his badge number.

30:42.915 --> 30:44.446
I remember it.

30:44.448 --> 30:47.452
Starr, do you know why
Khalil reached into the car?

30:49.488 --> 30:52.054
I think he was checking
to see that I was okay.

30:52.056 --> 30:53.624
You think?

30:53.626 --> 30:54.791
You don't know?

30:54.793 --> 30:56.493
No, I don't know.

30:56.495 --> 30:57.897
Because?

30:59.564 --> 31:01.965
Because that's when
it happened.

31:01.967 --> 31:03.532
- Did you and Khalil...
- Uh...

31:03.534 --> 31:06.538
Would you please
just give her a second?

31:12.544 --> 31:14.580
Whenever you're ready.
Okay, baby?

31:18.249 --> 31:20.216
We understand
that this is hard right now.

31:20.218 --> 31:21.385
Do you?

31:21.387 --> 31:22.788
Yes, Mrs. Carter, we do.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.159
Take your time.

31:35.499 --> 31:37.867
Did you drink alcohol
at the party?

31:37.869 --> 31:39.135
No, I don't drink.

31:39.137 --> 31:40.137
Did Khalil?

31:40.139 --> 31:41.370
Not that I saw.

31:41.372 --> 31:43.506
Did you ever see Khalil
sell narcotics?

31:43.508 --> 31:47.043
No, I never personally saw
Khalil sell drugs or do drugs.

31:47.045 --> 31:48.077
But you knew that he did?

31:48.079 --> 31:49.378
You have not asked my daughter

31:49.380 --> 31:50.781
one question about the cop.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.282
We just want the whole picture,
miss. That's all.

31:52.284 --> 31:54.184
Well, you ask questions
about what happened.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.485
115 killed Khalil.

31:56.487 --> 31:58.088
And he didn't do
anything wrong.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.088
So I don't know what more

31:59.090 --> 32:00.256
of a bigger picture you need!

32:02.061 --> 32:03.529
She's done here.

32:05.030 --> 32:07.330
Come on, Lisa. Come on, Starr.

32:07.332 --> 32:08.700
You know her?

32:10.835 --> 32:12.371
Yeah, she's my niece.

32:41.667 --> 32:43.800
All right. All right.

32:43.802 --> 32:45.201
I'm here.

32:45.203 --> 32:46.505
I'm here.

32:47.540 --> 32:48.641
Yeah.

32:54.714 --> 32:56.745
Let it out. Let it out.

32:56.747 --> 32:59.014
Easy. Let it out.
Yeah, let it out.

32:59.016 --> 33:00.652
Here. Here.

33:01.753 --> 33:04.052
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

33:04.054 --> 33:05.254
It's okay.

33:05.256 --> 33:06.926
Here. Drink this now.

33:07.892 --> 33:09.327
It's okay, baby.

33:23.408 --> 33:26.279
Nightmares are always
the worst right after.

33:41.860 --> 33:43.426
Sekani, no.

33:43.428 --> 33:45.398
Starr first. Let her eat.

33:59.977 --> 34:02.648
You know, not everybody got
superpowers like you.

34:07.151 --> 34:08.387
Shine your light.

34:09.655 --> 34:11.857
I ain't name you Starr
by accident.

34:19.965 --> 34:20.931
Sekani!

34:30.641 --> 34:32.945
No!

35:03.342 --> 35:04.477
Thank you.

35:10.849 --> 35:13.718
You the only real friend
that boy ever had.

35:16.622 --> 35:18.791
He was mine, too,
Miss Rosalie.

35:32.236 --> 35:33.805
Police came by.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.144
Was you with him, Starr?

35:44.381 --> 35:46.483
Yes, ma'am.

35:46.485 --> 35:48.921
Thank God he didn't leave
this world alone.

35:50.122 --> 35:52.388
You been by his side
from day one,

35:52.390 --> 35:54.959
and you stayed all the way
to the end.

35:57.595 --> 35:59.798
He was selling that stuff,
you know.

36:01.166 --> 36:03.803
Can't be for nobody but King.

36:05.604 --> 36:08.204
You got some nerve
coming in here.

36:08.206 --> 36:10.074
What's he doing here?

36:11.043 --> 36:12.175
Hey, Carlos.

36:12.177 --> 36:13.111
Hi, Lisa.

36:20.852 --> 36:21.787
Excuse me.

36:30.028 --> 36:32.095
Miss Rosalie,
I came by to tell you

36:32.097 --> 36:33.363
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:34.599 --> 36:36.568
And Pam and I
have been praying for you.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.801
Thank you so much.

36:38.803 --> 36:40.736
There's anything
I can do for you...

36:40.738 --> 36:42.507
know we are here for you.

36:44.209 --> 36:45.211
Love you.

37:04.496 --> 37:05.664
Look out.

37:15.173 --> 37:17.307
So what's the deal?

37:17.309 --> 37:18.774
His ass in jail?

37:18.776 --> 37:21.510
They're gonna place him
on paid administrative leave.

37:21.512 --> 37:23.079
That's it?

37:23.081 --> 37:25.015
After he killed Khalil?

37:25.017 --> 37:27.883
Starr, there will be
a full investigation.

37:27.885 --> 37:29.554
Cops investigating cops, huh?

37:30.289 --> 37:32.923
You know they should've charged
his racist ass with murder.

37:32.925 --> 37:35.624
But that ain't gonna happen,
is it, Uncle Carlos?

37:35.626 --> 37:37.126
Nothing like this
has ever happened

37:37.128 --> 37:38.495
with this officer before.

37:38.497 --> 37:40.363
Oh, first-timer.
Let's cut him a break.

37:40.365 --> 37:42.765
Carlos, you're gonna help
with the investigation, right?

37:42.767 --> 37:46.401
I can't. We hand situations
like this over to the DA.

37:46.403 --> 37:48.271
We headed for a grand jury?

37:48.273 --> 37:49.606
Most likely.

37:49.608 --> 37:51.173
And let me guess,
they gonna ask Starr to testify.

37:51.175 --> 37:52.774
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want everyone

37:52.776 --> 37:54.109
knowing that Starr
is the witness.

37:54.111 --> 37:55.711
She doesn't need
that kind of attention.

37:55.713 --> 37:57.513
No! Should we get a lawyer?

37:57.515 --> 37:58.948
Witnesses don't need attorneys.

37:58.950 --> 38:00.617
Starr ain't just
a witness, 'Los.

38:00.619 --> 38:02.586
Look, if you
don't trust the system,

38:02.588 --> 38:04.153
can you at least trust me?

38:04.155 --> 38:06.289
- Starr is like my daughter.
- But she ain't.

38:06.291 --> 38:08.323
It didn't seem that way
when you was locked up.

38:08.325 --> 38:10.628
Stop it! Both of you!

38:12.197 --> 38:13.597
What does a grand jury mean?

38:13.599 --> 38:14.900
<i>Grand jury.</i>

38:17.735 --> 38:20.238
<i>Stuff like this
ends up on the news.</i>

38:22.240 --> 38:23.742
<i>People get death threats.</i>

38:25.175 --> 38:26.744
<i>Cops target them.</i>

38:29.414 --> 38:31.082
<i>What will it mean at school?</i>

38:35.119 --> 38:36.952
<i>Will I suddenly be
the poor girl from the hood</i>

38:36.954 --> 38:38.723
<i>who saw her friend get killed?</i>

38:41.526 --> 38:43.095
<i>I just gotta be quiet.</i>

38:52.271 --> 38:54.640
<i>Can you just
give me more chicken?</i>

39:14.593 --> 39:16.861
- Starr, open!
- Starr!

39:17.662 --> 39:20.095
Starr, pass it!

39:24.336 --> 39:25.571
Damn!

39:26.338 --> 39:29.140
Starr, just pretend the ball
is a piece of fried chicken!

39:31.209 --> 39:33.811
- What was that?
- What? It's game talk.

39:34.979 --> 39:37.680
Fried chicken is game talk?

39:37.682 --> 39:39.015
I've never heard
that one before.

39:39.017 --> 39:42.718
Holy shit. Starr, we had
fried chicken for lunch?

39:42.720 --> 39:44.389
I-It was a joke.

39:49.227 --> 39:50.359
Okay.

39:50.361 --> 39:52.764
Wait. What's going on, girl?

39:53.631 --> 39:55.097
I mean, you know me,

39:55.099 --> 39:57.434
I know you,
better than anyone.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.437
You okay?

40:00.037 --> 40:02.340
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just tired.

40:14.086 --> 40:17.086
All right. Imma put Mav's
hot links on the grill.

40:17.088 --> 40:20.890
Little burnt on top
and crusty on the side.

40:20.892 --> 40:23.026
Y'all go ahead and take some
pound cake while y'all wait.

40:23.028 --> 40:24.961
- Thanks, Mr. Reuben.
- Thank you, Mr. Reuben.

40:24.963 --> 40:26.963
<i>...17-year-old black teenager</i>

40:26.965 --> 40:29.499

<i>New information

40:31.068 --> 40:33.635
<i>regarding the shooting death
of Khalil Harris.</i>

40:33.637 --> 40:35.838
<i>Dashcam footage,

40:35.840 --> 40:37.305
<i>he was going for a weapon</i>

40:37.307 --> 40:39.441

40:39.443 --> 40:42.012
<i>My son ain't

40:42.014 --> 40:43.847
- <i>Khalil was a good boy!</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

40:43.849 --> 40:45.080
<i>Why'd they have
to do that to hi?</i>

40:45.082 --> 40:47.182
<i>What this hae

40:47.184 --> 40:48.718

40:48.720 --> 40:50.120
<i>and brush his damn hai?</i>

40:50.122 --> 40:52.821
I mean, why would they put
Miss Brenda on TV like that?

40:52.823 --> 40:54.390
<i>There's a witness
to the shooting</i>

40:54.392 --> 40:57.660

So you famous now.

41:05.537 --> 41:06.635
What?

41:06.637 --> 41:08.905
I saw you leave with Khalil.

41:08.907 --> 41:11.510
Now you all jittery
and jumpy and shit.

41:13.144 --> 41:14.246
It's you, Starr.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.515
Don't even lie.

41:18.816 --> 41:20.485
You ready to stir
some shit up?

41:24.289 --> 41:25.454
What you mean?

41:25.456 --> 41:27.557
Well, you was there,
so you gotta tell everybody

41:27.559 --> 41:28.827
what happened.

41:30.894 --> 41:32.997
You're gonna stand up
for Khalil, right?

41:33.997 --> 41:36.966
Listen, Brenda can't be
the only one talking.

41:36.968 --> 41:39.438
You know Khalil would've
stood tall and spoke for you.

41:45.142 --> 41:46.276
Hey, queens.

41:46.278 --> 41:47.212
Hi, Daddy!

41:47.945 --> 41:49.148
Get in the car.

41:49.881 --> 41:51.183
Nah, I'm good.

41:52.182 --> 41:54.584
I'll take you up to Big Mav's.

What?

42:24.215 --> 42:27.052
Heard you was with that boy
when he got himself killed.

42:30.622 --> 42:32.124
Some hard shit to see.

42:33.758 --> 42:36.461
Believe me,
it's hard to forget, too.

42:39.697 --> 42:42.398
I been in the Heights forever.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.602
So trust.

42:45.436 --> 42:46.838
I been where you at.

42:48.139 --> 42:50.175
Hurt like that
don't never leave you.

42:51.108 --> 42:53.142
But you gotta keep pushing.

42:53.144 --> 42:54.345
You feel me?

43:01.753 --> 43:03.019
Mama at the house?

43:03.021 --> 43:05.754
I don't know.
Iesha be where she at.

43:05.756 --> 43:07.689
Ew.

43:07.691 --> 43:09.460
What about Seven?

43:10.961 --> 43:13.463
Why your daddy and Iesha
name that boy Seven?

43:13.465 --> 43:15.898
What's his middle name? Eight?

43:31.582 --> 43:32.682
Hey, Uncle Mav.

43:32.684 --> 43:33.919
Hey, Kenya.

43:44.896 --> 43:46.963
How's that domestic life
treatin' you?

43:48.166 --> 43:50.133
You go ahead,
put a ring on Iesha.

43:50.135 --> 43:51.602
You gonna find out.

43:56.039 --> 43:58.342
Look like
business is going well.

43:59.443 --> 44:01.343
Guess I should've bought
this store for me

44:01.345 --> 44:02.347
instead of you.

44:03.881 --> 44:05.182
But you didn't.

44:08.785 --> 44:10.988
I heard about Starr's homeboy.

44:12.456 --> 44:13.991
Man, you know how they do.

44:14.726 --> 44:16.662
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

44:17.961 --> 44:20.162
You really should try
and keep her out of trouble.

44:20.164 --> 44:21.300
Trouble?

44:22.133 --> 44:23.566
I'm just saying,
I think it's best

44:23.568 --> 44:24.934
if she don't talk to Five-O.

44:24.936 --> 44:26.836
You feel me?

44:26.838 --> 44:29.041
You ain't got to worry
about Starr.

44:30.474 --> 44:33.477
You take care of your girl,
and I'll handle mine.

44:34.878 --> 44:37.281
- It's like that?
- It's exactly like that.

44:47.057 --> 44:48.392
Hey, Starr.

44:49.126 --> 44:50.762
Remember what I told you,
all right?

44:51.528 --> 44:53.998
You keep that shit
in your rearview.

45:01.872 --> 45:03.638
<i>Mnh-mnh.
I'm telling you.</i>

45:03.640 --> 45:05.209
He was threatening her!

45:05.943 --> 45:07.542
He ain't gonna hurt her.

45:07.544 --> 45:08.644
He will.

45:08.646 --> 45:10.914
If he thinks that Starr
is gonna tell the police

45:10.916 --> 45:12.948
that Khalil worked
for him, he will.

45:12.950 --> 45:14.916
And then what? Hmm?

45:14.918 --> 45:17.220
He's gonna rope you
right back in.

45:17.222 --> 45:19.187
Once a King Lord,
always a King Lord.

45:19.189 --> 45:20.323
When you spend
three years in lockup

45:20.325 --> 45:21.657
doing somebody else's time,

45:21.659 --> 45:23.059
ain't no roping back in.

45:23.061 --> 45:24.997
He let me out.
That was our deal.

45:26.430 --> 45:27.432
Maverick...

45:28.365 --> 45:29.501
we're moving.

45:30.568 --> 45:33.505
Baby, we could do
some good stuff around here.

45:35.039 --> 45:39.274
Where you live does not define
who you are, Maverick.

45:39.276 --> 45:40.843
- Baby, listen to me...
- No!

45:40.845 --> 45:42.180
You listen!

45:42.947 --> 45:46.249
It's okay to make sacrifices
for your family.

45:46.251 --> 45:48.117
God! Do you think
that my mother moved

45:48.119 --> 45:50.019
me and Carlos
out of Garden Heights

45:50.021 --> 45:51.120
and into
that Catholic school

45:51.122 --> 45:53.424
so we could learn
how to pray? No.

45:54.157 --> 45:55.858
I'm gonna make sure
that my kids have it

45:55.860 --> 45:57.059
at least as good as I did.

45:57.061 --> 45:58.361
If not, what's the point?

45:58.363 --> 45:59.562
That's why we have them
up there in that school!

45:59.564 --> 46:01.664
And what do you think
that school will do

46:01.666 --> 46:04.135
when they find out
that Starr was with Khalil?

46:04.869 --> 46:06.035
Hmm?

46:06.037 --> 46:07.269
Those white folks,
they love to boast

46:07.271 --> 46:09.070
about how diverse
that school is,

46:09.072 --> 46:10.173
but you know what?

46:10.175 --> 46:11.640
This is too much diversity
for them.

46:15.912 --> 46:17.713
I don't feel good,
so I'm not going.

46:17.715 --> 46:20.950
None of us feel good, Starr,
but we're pressing on anyway.

46:20.952 --> 46:22.551
So you go get dressed.

46:22.553 --> 46:25.557
- I...
- Go get dressed.

47:09.668 --> 47:11.336
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

47:13.104 --> 47:14.606
Maybe when we get back...

47:15.539 --> 47:16.905
we can watch that

47:16.907 --> 47:19.140
<i>Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Half-Blood Gumble Ghosts.</i>

47:19.142 --> 47:20.709
I think I'm good, Daddy.

47:20.711 --> 47:23.881
You the worst person
to watch <i>Harry Potter</i> with.

47:24.881 --> 47:26.182
The whole time you're like,

47:26.184 --> 47:28.084
<i>"Harry Potter</i> is about
the gang theory."

47:28.086 --> 47:29.450
- It is.
- Mm-hmm.

47:29.452 --> 47:31.387
Hogwarts houses have
they own colors,

47:31.389 --> 47:33.222
they own hideouts,
and they always ridin'

47:33.224 --> 47:34.289
for each other.

47:34.291 --> 47:35.759
How that ain't about gangs?

47:36.494 --> 47:38.461
- You know I'm right.
- Mm-hmm.

47:38.463 --> 47:41.399
Y'all had y'all's own
little Harry Potter gang.

47:43.602 --> 47:46.838
Now Natasha and Khalil
both gone, and you still here.

47:50.307 --> 47:52.177
Trying to make
some sense out of it.

47:56.014 --> 47:57.481
It's THUG LIFE.

48:00.017 --> 48:02.017
"The Hate U Give
Little Infants..."

48:02.019 --> 48:03.354
"F's Everybody."

48:05.923 --> 48:07.391
I know what it stands for.

48:09.026 --> 48:10.695
What do you think it means?

48:15.265 --> 48:17.702
I think it's about
more than just the youth.

48:19.903 --> 48:21.169
I think it's about us.

48:21.171 --> 48:22.704
Us who?

48:22.706 --> 48:24.039
Black people.

48:24.041 --> 48:25.841
Poor people.
Everybody at the bottom.

48:25.843 --> 48:26.778
Right, you on it.

48:27.577 --> 48:28.744
Pac was trying
to school us

48:28.746 --> 48:30.749
on how the system's
designed against us.

48:31.950 --> 48:33.247
Why else you think
so many people

48:33.249 --> 48:34.619
in our neighborhood deal?

48:36.153 --> 48:38.289
- They need the money.
- Yeah.

48:39.090 --> 48:41.256
And there ain't no
real jobs around here,

48:41.258 --> 48:43.124
so they fall into the trap.

48:43.126 --> 48:44.563
What trap?

48:45.595 --> 48:48.664
Drugs a multi-billion-dollar
industry.

48:48.666 --> 48:50.999
Brothers like me
and Khalil get caught up

48:51.001 --> 48:52.637
'cause it look like a way out.

48:53.803 --> 48:55.874
But that shit is flown
into our communities...

48:56.608 --> 48:59.244
and I don't know nobody
with a private jet.

49:00.010 --> 49:01.912
- Do you?
- Mnh-mnh.

49:03.014 --> 49:04.216
Me neither.

49:04.981 --> 49:06.548
And then they trap us.

49:06.550 --> 49:09.684
And we end up in prison,
another billion-dollar hustle.

49:09.686 --> 49:11.486
And they got us
riding through there

49:11.488 --> 49:13.224
like we on a conveyor belt.

49:14.291 --> 49:16.693
That's how I end up
in prison with my daddy.

49:16.695 --> 49:18.563
You went to jail
with your own daddy?

49:19.564 --> 49:20.865
Yep.

49:21.898 --> 49:22.999
But when I caught up with him,

49:23.001 --> 49:24.736
wasn't nothin' he can do
to help me.

49:26.169 --> 49:28.706
He was just a weak,
old man with regrets.

49:30.307 --> 49:31.876
And his light was gone.

49:33.244 --> 49:35.412
And I swore
that would never be me.

49:37.247 --> 49:39.583
Because Imma break
the cycle for my kids.

50:09.814 --> 50:11.312
<i>I'm not ready
to see Khalil</i>

50:11.314 --> 50:12.851
<i>as a soulless mannequin.</i>

50:13.883 --> 50:15.352
<i>His lips are too pink.</i>

50:16.086 --> 50:18.023
<i>And he doesn't have
his dimples.</i>

50:25.463 --> 50:26.731
Come on, baby.

50:28.331 --> 50:30.000
It ain't him, Mama.

50:31.168 --> 50:32.370
I know.

50:43.615 --> 50:44.983

<i>We have a speaker here
with us today.</i>

52:44.968 --> 52:48.937
<i>The Harris family
have asked us all</i>

52:48.939 --> 52:52.043
<i>to listen
to what she has to say.</i>

52:52.977 --> 52:56.448
<i>Come on up,
Sister April Ofrah.</i>

53:08.291 --> 53:12.630
<i>I'm April Ofrah, a lawyr
with Just Us For Justic.</i>

53:13.731 --> 53:15.731
<i>Just before the service,
I was informed</i>

53:15.733 --> 53:17.231
<i>that the police
have no intentions</i>

53:17.233 --> 53:20.334
<i>of arresting the officer
who murdered this young man.</i>

53:21.572 --> 53:24.039
<i>Despite having
a credible eyewitness.</i>

53:24.041 --> 53:25.510
Oh, my God!

53:27.912 --> 53:31.113
<i>This is the last place
I wanted to be today.</i>

53:31.115 --> 53:32.448
<i>And I know I'm not alone.</i>

53:33.784 --> 53:36.053
<i>But here we are agai.</i>

53:38.155 --> 53:40.491
<i>Violence, brutalit.</i>

53:41.492 --> 53:44.158
<i>It's the same story,
just a different name.</i>

53:44.160 --> 53:45.829
Yes. You're right.

53:50.233 --> 53:53.035
<i>Today's name is Khalil Harri.</i>

53:53.037 --> 53:57.138
<i>Another unarmed,
young, black man.</i>

53:57.140 --> 53:58.709
<i>What does that tell us?</i>

54:00.443 --> 54:02.246
<i>Shamell Bell said it best.</i>

54:03.247 --> 54:05.080
<i>"It is impossible
to be unarmed</i>

54:05.082 --> 54:08.117
<i>when our blackness is
the weapon that they fear."</i>

54:13.124 --> 54:16.425
<i>And I refuse
to let our blackness be seen</i>

54:16.427 --> 54:19.160
<i>as a weapon or as a weakness.</i>

54:19.162 --> 54:21.296
- Yeah!
- Yeah! That's right!

54:21.298 --> 54:24.399
<i>That is why the Harris family
and I ask you</i>

54:24.401 --> 54:26.602
<i>to join us
after the service...</i>

54:26.604 --> 54:30.707
<i>for a peaceful march
past the police station.</i>

54:32.242 --> 54:34.077
<i>Division is how they win.</i>

54:34.878 --> 54:37.812
- <i>Unity is how they crumble.</i>
- Yeah!

54:37.814 --> 54:40.184
<i>See you outside
after the service. Thank you.</i>

54:45.389 --> 54:46.787
<i>Amen!</i>

54:46.789 --> 54:49.191
- <i>Thank you!</i>
- Whoo!

<i>Thank you, Sister Ofrah,
for such powerful</i>

54:52.829 --> 54:54.865
<i>and encouraging words.</i>

54:57.133 --> 54:58.700
Did you see that?

54:58.702 --> 55:00.269
How does she even know?

55:00.271 --> 55:01.503
Gotta be Miss Rosalie.

56:18.314 --> 56:21.350
<i>Remember, this is
a peaceful protest!</i>

56:21.352 --> 56:22.684
I ain't too sure about that.

56:22.686 --> 56:24.586
Boy, don't put
your hands on me!

56:24.588 --> 56:27.455
<i>This is a peaceful protest!</i>

56:27.457 --> 56:28.722
You pushed her!

56:28.724 --> 56:32.327
- No justice, no peace!
- <i>No racist police!</i>

56:32.329 --> 56:35.363
No justice,
no peace! No racist police!

56:35.365 --> 56:36.631
All right,
we gotta leave.

56:36.633 --> 56:38.533
No justice, no peace!

56:38.535 --> 56:39.633
Let's go!

56:39.635 --> 56:40.801
No racist police!

56:40.803 --> 56:43.271
No justice, no peace...

56:43.273 --> 56:44.307
Hey, Seven!

56:45.409 --> 56:46.878
Come on.

56:48.611 --> 56:49.914
What the hell
you talkin' about?

56:52.749 --> 56:55.751
No justice,
no peace! No racist police!

56:55.753 --> 56:59.887
No justice, no peace!
No racist police!

56:59.889 --> 57:04.559
No justice, no peace!
No racist police!

57:04.561 --> 57:07.995
No justice, no peace!
No racist police!

57:07.997 --> 57:11.966
No justice, no peace!
No racist police!

57:11.968 --> 57:13.901
No justice, no peace!

57:13.903 --> 57:15.269
<i>A protest took place</i>

57:15.271 --> 57:16.771
<i>in the neighborhood
of Garden Heights</i>

57:16.773 --> 57:19.006
<i>following the funeral
of Khalil Harris,</i>

57:19.008 --> 57:22.044
<i>a young black man who was
killed by a police officer.</i>

57:22.046 --> 57:24.046
<i>And though the protest
started peacefully,</i>

57:24.048 --> 57:25.548
<i>it quickly turned violent</i>

57:25.550 --> 57:27.548
<i>as protesters
and police clashed.</i>

57:27.550 --> 57:30.051
<i>This comes after no charges
were brought forward</i>

57:30.053 --> 57:31.787
<i>against the police officer</i>

57:31.789 --> 57:33.421
<i>who has been placed
on administrative leave</i>

57:33.423 --> 57:35.624
<i>until all the evidence
can be evaluated.</i>

57:35.626 --> 57:38.727
<i>We now take you to coverage
from earlier this evening.</i>

57:38.729 --> 57:40.562
<i>I'm here
with the protesters</i>

57:40.564 --> 57:41.997
<i>on the way
to the police station.</i>

57:43.032 --> 57:44.800
<i>That cop shot that boy
in cold blood</i>

57:44.802 --> 57:46.066
<i>for no damn reason!</i>

57:46.068 --> 57:47.570
<i>Innocent black men
keep getting killed</i>

57:47.572 --> 57:49.338
<i>by the police
time and time again,</i>

57:49.340 --> 57:50.472
<i>and it ain't right!</i>

57:50.474 --> 57:52.608
<i>The whole damn system
is corrupt as hell.</i>

57:52.610 --> 57:53.908
<i>As you can see,</i>

57:53.910 --> 57:55.477
<i>emotions are high here
in Garden Heights.</i>

57:55.479 --> 57:57.879
<i>The community is outraged
with what has been happening,</i>

57:57.881 --> 57:59.381
<i>and they are seeking justice.</i>

58:15.099 --> 58:17.434
Bullets don't know
where they supposed to go.

58:21.604 --> 58:22.704
Hey, Mama,

58:22.706 --> 58:25.539
are they mad
'cause Khalil died?

58:25.541 --> 58:27.477
Yeah, baby. We all are.

58:42.358 --> 58:45.093
That's what's up!
They're afraid of us, y'all!

58:57.508 --> 58:58.539
Hey.

58:58.541 --> 58:59.573
Are you and your family safe?

58:59.575 --> 59:00.510
I'm watching the news.

59:01.378 --> 59:04.081
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.
We're completely safe.

59:04.847 --> 59:05.814
You sure?

59:07.718 --> 59:10.452
Maverick, don't answer it.

59:10.454 --> 59:11.653
I gotta go.

59:11.655 --> 59:13.187
Hold on, Starr.

59:13.189 --> 59:14.258
Starr.

59:19.195 --> 59:20.130
Who is it?

59:23.800 --> 59:25.969
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:26.736 --> 59:28.104
Can I come in?

59:29.506 --> 59:30.905
<i>As police are investigating</i>

59:30.907 --> 59:32.274
<i>the routine traffic stop
that turned...</i>

59:32.276 --> 59:34.008
Khalil can't speak
for himself.

59:34.010 --> 59:36.044
He needs a voice.
Starr is it.

59:36.046 --> 59:37.579
I don't like this already.

59:37.581 --> 59:39.150
Lisa, just hear her on out.

59:40.117 --> 59:43.086
Starr, do you understand
what a grand jury is?

59:44.088 --> 59:45.320
Yeah. It's where they decide

59:45.322 --> 59:46.954
if somebody should go
to trial.

59:46.956 --> 59:48.657
Right. It's when they decide

59:48.659 --> 59:51.327
if charges should be brought
against Officer Macintosh.

59:51.329 --> 59:52.530
Will they indict him?

59:53.930 --> 59:56.231
99 percent of the time,
the grand jury indicts.

59:56.233 --> 59:58.236
What about that
one percent they don't?

59:59.336 --> 01:00:02.303
Those cases
almost always involve a cop.

01:00:02.305 --> 01:00:03.738
But that won't happen
this time,

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.073
because I saw everything.

01:00:05.075 --> 01:00:09.146
When Khalil was shot,
where were you exactly?

01:00:09.912 --> 01:00:11.345
In the passenger seat.

01:00:11.347 --> 01:00:14.749
Do you have any proof
of what you saw?

01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:16.653
Like, did you record it
on a phone?

01:00:18.122 --> 01:00:20.224
Nah, the officer told me
to drop it.

01:00:21.157 --> 01:00:23.758
So Khalil will never have
his day in court?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.196
All 'cause a cop shot him?

01:00:26.597 --> 01:00:29.100
That's why our trial
begins now.

01:00:29.932 --> 01:00:31.867
On the streets, in the media.

01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:33.968
Starr is Khalil's
only witness.

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:35.470
All right.

01:00:35.472 --> 01:00:37.037
Where do we start?

01:00:37.039 --> 01:00:38.472
With a TV interview.

01:00:38.474 --> 01:00:39.675
No.

01:00:39.677 --> 01:00:42.412
I know what you're fighting for,
but I fight for Starr.

01:00:43.213 --> 01:00:45.416
And I won't put her at risk.

01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:55.492
Thank you.

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:04.800
My other best friend
was murdered

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:06.070
when we were both ten.

01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:11.142
We were playing basketball
on the sidewalk.

01:01:18.548 --> 01:01:20.251
<i>When this car rolled by...</i>

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.119
<i>and this tatted hand
pulled out a gun.</i>

01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:27.291
<i>We must have been in the way.</i>

01:01:28.691 --> 01:01:30.061
<i>It was three shots.</i>

01:01:32.996 --> 01:01:34.631
<i>And she was on the ground.</i>

01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:39.070
And I remember...

01:01:40.938 --> 01:01:42.974
I remember
she looked really scared...

01:01:44.173 --> 01:01:47.244
because she was about to see
what happens after you die.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:54.584
And I know who did it.

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:56.651
What?

01:01:56.653 --> 01:01:58.421
Starr, you never told us that.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.294
It was a King Lord.

01:02:08.731 --> 01:02:10.400
He missed me once...

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:13.234
and I didn't want to give him
another chance,

01:02:13.236 --> 01:02:15.372
so I didn't snitch.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.176
And then I heard a few months
later that he got killed.

01:02:21.744 --> 01:02:23.413
So I didn't say anything.

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:30.053
Now tell me, Miss Ofrah...

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:34.592
what kind of friend is that?

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.729
You can't blame yourself
for that, Starr.

01:02:41.664 --> 01:02:43.564
You were young.

01:02:43.566 --> 01:02:44.702
You are young.

01:02:50.006 --> 01:02:53.177
I wanna be a better friend
for Khalil.

01:02:56.213 --> 01:02:58.149
But goin' on TV...

01:03:00.784 --> 01:03:03.053
I don't know about all that.

01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:09.259
Well, if you ever need
legal advice or...

01:03:10.026 --> 01:03:11.262
you change your mind...

01:03:12.428 --> 01:03:13.561
I'm here.

01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:14.698
Thank you.

01:03:29.512 --> 01:03:30.879
Yeah!

01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:32.213
No, school, guys!
Come on!

01:03:32.215 --> 01:03:34.816
Let's go!
Yo, let's go!

01:03:34.818 --> 01:03:36.117
Let's go!

01:03:36.119 --> 01:03:37.720
Don't run in the halls!

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.222
Jackson, slow it down!

01:03:42.224 --> 01:03:44.059
Hey, what is going on?

01:03:44.061 --> 01:03:45.829
School's out. Protesting's in.

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:49.863
And I was so ready for that
history test this morning.

01:03:49.865 --> 01:03:51.134
Hey!

01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:54.035
Where have you been?

01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:55.438
Everyone's ditching, girl.
Come on, let's go.

01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:07.983
Really? I thought
you'd love this

01:04:07.985 --> 01:04:10.584
considering what you've been
putting up on Tumblr lately.

01:04:10.586 --> 01:04:11.820
- Love it?
- Well...

01:04:11.822 --> 01:04:13.120
Not love it obviously,

01:04:13.122 --> 01:04:14.821
but, I mean, you care, right?

01:04:14.823 --> 01:04:16.425
It's your neighborhood.

01:04:16.427 --> 01:04:17.894
I thought you might
even know the guy.

01:04:19.997 --> 01:04:21.495
I just don't think it's,
you know, cool

01:04:21.497 --> 01:04:24.164
to use the situation
as an excuse to skip class.

01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:25.367
What the hell, Starr?

01:04:25.369 --> 01:04:27.068
It's not just an excuse
to skip class.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.669
It's a good cause.

01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:30.606
It also happens to be
a really good excuse

01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:31.905
to cut school.

01:04:31.907 --> 01:04:34.008
I really don't want to see
our math teacher's face today.

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.945
Do you?

01:04:35.678 --> 01:04:37.678

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.649

Justice for Khalil!

01:04:57.367 --> 01:04:59.202
What? What's wrong?

01:05:00.037 --> 01:05:01.272
This isn't right.

01:05:02.372 --> 01:05:04.742
Who else is gonna speak up
for our people, girl?

01:05:06.008 --> 01:05:07.378
Our people?

01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:16.653
Where are you going?

01:05:19.923 --> 01:05:20.857
Starr?

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.091
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:24.758
I don't feel well.
I'm going home.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.795
What's wrong?

01:05:26.963 --> 01:05:27.898
Hey.

01:05:31.233 --> 01:05:32.535
You knew him, didn't you?

01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:34.604
The kid who got killed.

01:05:36.572 --> 01:05:38.372
Nah. Just give me
some space, okay?

01:05:38.374 --> 01:05:40.210
Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

01:05:41.644 --> 01:05:42.713
Starr?

01:05:48.418 --> 01:05:50.688
Hey. Can you come get me?

01:06:17.113 --> 01:06:18.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:25.320
Cramps, huh?

01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:28.992
Yeah. People cramps.

01:06:43.273 --> 01:06:45.508
- Be well.
- Thanks, Unc.

01:06:49.146 --> 01:06:50.577
So, just 'cause some dumb,

01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:52.314
privileged white kids
skip class,

01:06:52.316 --> 01:06:53.914
you think it's okay for you
to leave school too?

01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:55.649
Well, guess what, Starr.

01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:57.720
- It is what it is.
- I know, Mama.

01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.555
But they're acting
like Khalil was murdered

01:07:01.557 --> 01:07:04.291
just so that they can skip
a chem test.

01:07:04.293 --> 01:07:06.429
And I didn't do anything
about it.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:08.965
Mama...

01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:14.337
I need to speak for him.

01:07:24.613 --> 01:07:26.414
Let me guess.
You're Starr.

01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:27.948
Yeah.

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:31.151
Starr, thank you so much for
having the courage to do this.

01:07:31.153 --> 01:07:32.254
You're welcome.

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:33.824
Diane's very excited
to have you.

01:07:34.523 --> 01:07:35.624
We even bumped a segment

01:07:35.626 --> 01:07:37.158
to make sure
yours airs tonight.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.128
And you're sure the thing
we talked about is happening?

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:41.294
It's arranged.

01:07:41.296 --> 01:07:43.564
They've agreed to blur
Starr's face.

01:07:43.566 --> 01:07:45.336
No one watching
will ever know it's her.

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:52.606
You are the only witness
to the shooting death

01:07:52.608 --> 01:07:56.611
of a young, unarmed black man
by a police officer.

01:07:56.613 --> 01:07:58.646
Now, millions of people
across the country

01:07:58.648 --> 01:08:01.515
have heard the name
Khalil Harris.

01:08:01.517 --> 01:08:03.119
Who was he to you?

01:08:04.287 --> 01:08:06.254
We knew each other
since we were babies

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:09.356
but if he was here,
he would probably say...

01:08:09.358 --> 01:08:12.059
that he was actually
five months, two weeks,

01:08:12.061 --> 01:08:13.829
and one day older than me.

01:08:13.831 --> 01:08:15.162
He was a kid.

01:08:15.164 --> 01:08:16.296
Yep.

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:17.865
What do you think
about the people

01:08:17.867 --> 01:08:21.104
that are only focusing on the
not-so-good aspects of Khalil?

01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:23.639
That he sold drugs.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.774
Well, if they knew why,

01:08:25.776 --> 01:08:28.008
then they wouldn't talk
about him like that.

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:29.810
Why did he sell them?

01:08:29.812 --> 01:08:32.513
Khalil's mom loved him,
but she was an addict

01:08:32.515 --> 01:08:35.149
so there was no one
to bring in money

01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.584
to help his little brother...

01:08:36.586 --> 01:08:38.852
and his grandma
who has cancer.

01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:41.654
<i>So he had to take
the only available jb</i>

01:08:41.657 --> 01:08:42.957
<i>in the neighborhod</i>

01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:44.825
<i>that would pay him enouh
to help them.</i>

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:45.928
Available job?

01:08:55.604 --> 01:08:58.142
Dealing for the biggest
drug dealers in Garden Heights.

01:08:59.075 --> 01:09:00.676
The King Lords.

01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:04.912
<i>So there's one gang</i>

01:09:04.913 --> 01:09:08.015
<i>that controls
your entire neighborhood?</i>

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:09.685
<i>Tell me about that.</i>

01:09:11.687 --> 01:09:13.687
Why are you only asking me
about that?

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:15.689
I mean, next week,
I'll be called to testify

01:09:15.692 --> 01:09:17.124
in a grand jury
investigation,

01:09:17.126 --> 01:09:19.327
but no one wants to know
what actually happened.

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:22.529
<i>Everyone wants to know
what Khalil did.</i>

01:09:22.531 --> 01:09:24.966
<i>What he said,
what he didn't do.</i>

01:09:24.968 --> 01:09:27.234
Like it's his fault.

01:09:27.237 --> 01:09:28.602
I didn't know
that a dead person

01:09:28.604 --> 01:09:30.773
could be charged
with his own murder.

01:09:32.474 --> 01:09:35.211
If Officer Macintosh
were sitting here now...

01:09:36.145 --> 01:09:37.781
what would you say to him?

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:43.986
I'd ask him if he wished
that he shot me too.

01:09:50.559 --> 01:09:51.859
- Here we go!
- Checkin' in, bro?

01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:53.993
Yeah. I might.
Yeah, it makes sense.

01:09:53.995 --> 01:09:55.097
I know.

01:09:56.799 --> 01:09:58.199
Y'all need
anything else?

01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:00.971
Nah, I think we got everything
we need right here.

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.673
Ugh.

01:10:06.675 --> 01:10:08.476
Y'all really gotta be
booed up like that?

01:10:08.478 --> 01:10:10.511
How else you think
I pulled her?

01:10:10.513 --> 01:10:11.645
I know how.

01:10:11.647 --> 01:10:13.148
Mama!

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:16.484
See, we did not need
all of that.

01:10:16.486 --> 01:10:18.052
I'm scarred for life.

01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:24.391
All right, y'all, circle up.

01:10:24.393 --> 01:10:25.795
All right.

01:10:31.968 --> 01:10:34.200
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you
for blessing this food

01:10:34.202 --> 01:10:35.569
- and this family.
- Hmm.

01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:38.038
And thank you for allowing
Starr to shine today.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.711
Yes, Lord, and please help her
stay focused on her studies.

01:10:46.549 --> 01:10:48.085
Thank you for my family.

01:10:49.152 --> 01:10:50.452
That's what I was gonna say.

01:10:52.955 --> 01:10:54.922
Me too.

01:10:54.924 --> 01:10:55.789
Amen.

01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:57.056
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:10:57.058 --> 01:10:59.226
- Amen.
- Eat the greens first, man.

01:10:59.228 --> 01:11:00.627
- Hey.
- Need that hot sauce.

01:11:00.629 --> 01:11:01.895
- Vegetables.
- Think about it...

01:11:01.897 --> 01:11:03.967
- Vegetables.
- ...at least.

01:11:05.668 --> 01:11:07.702
- And compare it to the hot sauce?
- Yeah...

01:11:07.704 --> 01:11:09.005
No. Mnh-mnh.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.205
I like the Tabasco.

01:11:11.207 --> 01:11:13.407
Are you gonna ask
for more sugar, like always?

01:11:13.409 --> 01:11:14.775
It's really good.

01:11:14.777 --> 01:11:16.510
Why are you worried
about my sugar?

01:11:16.512 --> 01:11:18.078
Let me taste that.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.046
See, you put hot sauce.

01:11:19.048 --> 01:11:20.547
That's why I said
it needs Tabasco.

01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:21.682
Yeah.

01:11:21.684 --> 01:11:23.786
This ain't
hot enough right here.

01:11:25.187 --> 01:11:26.721
I'll try it though.

01:11:26.723 --> 01:11:29.157
What, you don't want to, baby?
Put a little bit of the yam.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:30.994
Lisa.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:33.229
Stay here.

01:11:42.938 --> 01:11:45.873
Hey, Starr did some real
stupid shit today.

01:11:45.875 --> 01:11:47.208
Keep my kids
out your mouth, King.

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:50.581
Your hard head makes
for a soft ass whoopin'.

01:11:52.415 --> 01:11:53.847
You comin' close
to gettin' your own.

01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:55.218
Well, why don't you try it?

01:11:56.952 --> 01:11:57.955
Stay!

01:11:58.987 --> 01:12:00.990
Hey, why don't you...

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:03.994
Hey, come on!

01:12:21.177 --> 01:12:22.743
You got a problem here?

01:12:22.745 --> 01:12:24.546
No, sir, Officer.

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:25.747
What was that?

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:27.215
I'm just having dinner
with my family.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:28.384
Until you came out to score?

01:12:29.384 --> 01:12:30.720
All right, come on. Let's go.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:32.653
Lean against the wall.

01:12:32.655 --> 01:12:34.154
It's okay, Sekani.

01:12:34.156 --> 01:12:36.856
Starr, you breathe.
Just breathe, okay, baby?

01:12:36.858 --> 01:12:39.627
- All right, he's clean.
- Take out your ID.

01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:41.561
- My wife has my wallet.
- Where is she?

01:12:41.563 --> 01:12:42.765
Get my wallet!

01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:47.400
- Stop.
- Daddy?

01:12:47.402 --> 01:12:49.271
It's okay!

01:12:50.639 --> 01:12:52.041
All right, I got it
right here, Officer.

01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:58.212
Maverick Carter.
Sound familiar?

01:12:58.214 --> 01:12:59.346
Go back inside now.

01:12:59.348 --> 01:13:00.748
No, thank you, Officer.
I will wait right here

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:01.882
until you release
my husband.

01:13:01.884 --> 01:13:03.184
I said go back inside.

01:13:03.186 --> 01:13:04.918
No, sir. My father didn't do
anything wrong.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.855
- Show me your ID.
- He is a child!

01:13:06.857 --> 01:13:08.256
Do you want to see
his school ID

01:13:08.258 --> 01:13:09.422
or his learner's permit?

01:13:09.424 --> 01:13:11.825
Ma'am, go back inside...

01:13:11.827 --> 01:13:13.627
- He didn't do anything!
- All right, that's it.

01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:14.995
I know you saw
that car drive away.

01:13:14.997 --> 01:13:16.763
I know you saw
that car drive off.

01:13:16.765 --> 01:13:17.931
You saw that guy drive off!

01:13:17.933 --> 01:13:18.932
Why don't you talk
to him, huh?

01:13:18.934 --> 01:13:20.303
No! No! Sekani, go inside!

01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:22.903
Put that down, now!

01:13:22.905 --> 01:13:24.741
I have a right to record this.

01:13:29.879 --> 01:13:31.378
She's the witness.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.346
Yeah, we see y'all.
And all these cameras do, too!

01:13:33.348 --> 01:13:35.785
Go on and show everybody
how y'all really treat us.

01:13:43.692 --> 01:13:44.994
Let's go.

01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:49.265
Consider this a warning.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.770
You okay? You okay?

01:13:57.772 --> 01:13:59.640
Y'all get y'all stuff
and let's go.

01:13:59.642 --> 01:14:00.943
Okay.

01:14:02.077 --> 01:14:03.010
You okay?

01:14:03.012 --> 01:14:04.477
You okay?
All right, come on.

01:14:04.479 --> 01:14:05.479
Come on.
Let's get Sekani.

01:14:05.481 --> 01:14:07.084
Oh, baby.

01:14:34.611 --> 01:14:36.146
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

01:14:38.615 --> 01:14:39.883
This is my fault.

01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.449
I never
should have gone on TV.

01:14:42.451 --> 01:14:43.520
I should've stayed quiet.

01:14:44.687 --> 01:14:46.189
Everybody, get up out the car.

01:14:48.323 --> 01:14:50.527
Get out the car
and line up on the grass.

01:15:05.207 --> 01:15:07.978
Point seven of
the Ten-Point Program. Say it.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.482
Stop crying and say it!

01:15:16.419 --> 01:15:19.186
"We want an immediate end
to police brutality."

01:15:19.188 --> 01:15:20.288
Finish it.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:21.754
"And the murder
of Black people

01:15:21.756 --> 01:15:22.922
and people of color
and oppressed people."

01:15:22.924 --> 01:15:24.925
- By what means?
- By any means necessary.

01:15:24.927 --> 01:15:26.327
- By what means?
- By any means necessary.

01:15:26.329 --> 01:15:28.596
- By what means?
- By any means necessary.

01:15:28.598 --> 01:15:30.200
So why you gonna be quiet?

01:15:36.339 --> 01:15:37.407
What does that say?

01:15:41.744 --> 01:15:44.544
"Reasons to live.
Give reasons to die."

01:15:44.546 --> 01:15:45.514
Yeah.

01:15:47.383 --> 01:15:49.318
You, your brothers...

01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:51.421
and your mother...

01:15:52.153 --> 01:15:54.890
are my reasons
to live and die.

01:15:55.758 --> 01:15:58.659
I gave each of you power
in your names.

01:15:58.661 --> 01:16:00.294
Seven: perfection.

01:16:00.296 --> 01:16:01.194
Starr: light.

01:16:01.196 --> 01:16:02.431
Sekani: joy.

01:16:03.799 --> 01:16:05.101
Use it!

01:16:09.004 --> 01:16:10.506
So when you ready
to talk...

01:16:11.807 --> 01:16:12.943
you talk.

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:16.146
Don't ever let nobody
make you be quiet.

01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:41.836
Are you kidding me?

01:16:41.838 --> 01:16:43.437
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

01:16:43.439 --> 01:16:44.904
Three-pointer!

01:16:44.906 --> 01:16:46.039
Oh, my gosh.

01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:47.708
You suck. Whatever.

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:49.176
Are you kidding me?

01:16:49.178 --> 01:16:50.843
I'm going to get you.

01:16:57.519 --> 01:16:58.655
What's up with you?

01:17:00.188 --> 01:17:01.156
Nothing.

01:17:02.023 --> 01:17:03.457
What, so I'm trippin'?

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:06.062
You haven't said more than
five words since we got here.

01:17:07.464 --> 01:17:08.895
I'm talking right now.

01:17:08.897 --> 01:17:10.730
What more do you
want me to say?

01:17:10.732 --> 01:17:12.768
Why don't we just
go back to the TV?

01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:16.236
<i>Callers
eligible must be 18 or older.</i>

01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:19.806
<i>...after the shooting...</i>

01:17:19.808 --> 01:17:21.076
Wait, can you go back?

01:17:22.445 --> 01:17:24.444
<i>Officer Brian Macintosh Junior</i>

01:17:24.446 --> 01:17:26.646
<i>has been on the force
for five years.</i>

01:17:26.648 --> 01:17:29.617
<i>A majority of those years
serving in Garden Heights,</i>

01:17:29.619 --> 01:17:31.150
<i>known for its high crime rate,</i>

01:17:31.152 --> 01:17:34.221
<i>with murders up 15 percent

01:17:34.223 --> 01:17:37.624
<i>Officers have struggled for
years to rein in the violence.</i>

01:17:37.626 --> 01:17:39.092
<i>Changes in policies,</i>

01:17:39.094 --> 01:17:40.794
<i>gangs, and drugs
have remained an issue</i>

01:17:40.796 --> 01:17:44.166
<i>for this predominantly

01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:47.001
<i>Brian is a good boy.</i>

01:17:47.003 --> 01:17:49.736
<i>People, they're making him

01:17:49.738 --> 01:17:51.538
<i>He's afraid to go out

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.940

<i>Our family's lives.</i>

01:17:57.546 --> 01:17:59.413
Wow. That sucks.

01:17:59.415 --> 01:18:00.517
That poor family.

01:18:03.686 --> 01:18:04.652
What?

01:18:05.588 --> 01:18:08.258
His son was only trying to do
his job and protect himself.

01:18:09.092 --> 01:18:10.693
His life matters too,
you know.

01:18:15.665 --> 01:18:16.700
Okay, um...

01:18:17.665 --> 01:18:19.199
I need to...

01:18:19.201 --> 01:18:20.135
Yeah.

01:18:21.536 --> 01:18:24.240
Whoa. You guys haven't
figured this out yet?

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:27.574
Wait. Starr. Starr!

01:18:27.576 --> 01:18:29.243
Maya, I cannot talk
to her right now.

01:18:29.245 --> 01:18:31.043
That cop's life
matters also.

01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:33.314
Are you gonna be mad
because I said that, too?

01:18:33.316 --> 01:18:34.250
Yeah.

01:18:34.983 --> 01:18:37.485
Because you think that
his life matters more

01:18:37.487 --> 01:18:39.819
than the person that you said
you were protesting for.

01:18:39.821 --> 01:18:40.753
That's a problem.

01:18:40.755 --> 01:18:41.855
Problem?

01:18:41.857 --> 01:18:43.157
Please, guys, come on.

01:18:43.159 --> 01:18:45.394
You unfollowed my Tumblr
after the protest.

01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:48.031
Why?

01:18:48.897 --> 01:18:51.433
Was it the picture
of Emmett Till that did it?

01:18:52.335 --> 01:18:54.935
Did you sympathize
with his poor family

01:18:54.937 --> 01:18:56.369
before you looked away?

01:18:56.371 --> 01:18:58.638
Okay. Maya,
now she's calling me a racist.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.041
Nah, I didn't.

01:19:00.043 --> 01:19:01.777
I just asked you a question.

01:19:04.446 --> 01:19:05.748
Unbelievable.

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:09.619
You know what?

01:19:11.187 --> 01:19:13.555
I don't know who the hell
you are anymore, Starr.

01:19:17.058 --> 01:19:19.294
That's the real reason
I unfollowed you.

01:19:48.957 --> 01:19:50.259
Damn.

01:19:52.061 --> 01:19:53.793
You can never
go wrong with black.

01:19:53.795 --> 01:19:56.363
It is always so elegant.

01:19:56.365 --> 01:19:57.332
I swear.

01:19:58.166 --> 01:20:00.536
You are gonna look
so beautiful for prom.

01:20:03.406 --> 01:20:06.105
What's wrong, munch?
Talk to me.

01:20:06.107 --> 01:20:09.845
It's just me and Hailey
got into it.

01:20:12.714 --> 01:20:13.715
Mama?

01:20:14.951 --> 01:20:17.450
- What?
- You never liked her.

01:20:17.452 --> 01:20:20.087
No. That's not true.

01:20:20.089 --> 01:20:21.821
I never liked
how you followed her around

01:20:21.823 --> 01:20:22.922
like you can't think
for yourself.

01:20:22.924 --> 01:20:24.025
There's a difference.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:25.292
Like the time
that you begged me

01:20:25.294 --> 01:20:26.325
to dye your hair purple. Yeah.

01:20:26.327 --> 01:20:27.828
I wanted to have purple hair.

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:28.895
No, no, no.

01:20:28.897 --> 01:20:29.830
No! Why?

01:20:29.832 --> 01:20:31.134
The real why.

01:20:36.604 --> 01:20:38.873
Because Hailey wanted me,
her, and Maya

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:40.341
to have matching hair
at school.

01:20:40.343 --> 01:20:42.845
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you. Right there.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.682
All right, so what happened
between y'all now?

01:20:48.416 --> 01:20:51.120
It's just some of the stuff
she says. It's like...

01:20:53.255 --> 01:20:54.387
It makes me wonder how

01:20:54.389 --> 01:20:55.858
we're even friends
in the first place.

01:20:57.293 --> 01:20:58.693
Now that's something,
you know what,

01:20:58.695 --> 01:20:59.659
you need to ask yourself.

01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:01.561
If this friendship
is even worth it.

01:21:01.563 --> 01:21:03.564
I'm just so mad
that I don't know.

01:21:03.566 --> 01:21:06.033
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
You don't have time to be mad.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.501
You're behind
in your schoolwork.

01:21:07.503 --> 01:21:09.468
You... You ain't ready
for your SATs.

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.808
You need to just forgive
and you move on.

01:21:13.543 --> 01:21:15.445
Is that what you did
with Daddy?

01:21:17.245 --> 01:21:19.279
After he got Iesha pregnant
with Seven?

01:21:19.281 --> 01:21:21.351
You just forgave
and you moved on?

01:21:27.188 --> 01:21:29.159
Yeah.

01:21:29.991 --> 01:21:31.792
Yeah, I did.

01:21:31.794 --> 01:21:32.762
It wasn't easy.

01:21:33.728 --> 01:21:35.730
And even though your dad
and I had been broken up

01:21:35.732 --> 01:21:38.835
when he got tangled up
with Iesha, it still hurt.

01:21:40.135 --> 01:21:42.535
But you know what?
I had to decide. Me.

01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:45.808
If my love for your dad
was bigger than his mistakes.

01:21:47.343 --> 01:21:49.479
The love that I share
with your dad?

01:21:50.679 --> 01:21:51.748
That...

01:21:52.514 --> 01:21:55.418
That is bigger than everything.

01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:57.918
Even with crazy Iesha?

01:22:00.455 --> 01:22:03.524
Yeah. Even with crazy Iesha.

01:22:03.526 --> 01:22:05.926
Listen, baby,
if the good outweighs the bad,

01:22:05.928 --> 01:22:08.227
then you keep Hailey
in your life.

01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:09.631
But if it doesn't...

01:22:10.832 --> 01:22:12.268
you let her go.

01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:54.410
Hey.

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:01.417
It's you, right?

01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:07.022
You told me
you didn't know Khalil.

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:15.361
Yeah, I knew him.

01:23:15.363 --> 01:23:17.465
Did you not think
that I was gonna find out?

01:23:18.299 --> 01:23:19.936
Were you just gonna hide
everything from me?

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:22.403
It's not like that.

01:23:22.405 --> 01:23:24.739
Starr, I'm your boyfriend.
That's what I'm here for.

01:23:24.741 --> 01:23:26.340
It's not like
I don't trust you.

01:23:26.342 --> 01:23:28.475
Then what's it like?
Tell me. Please.

01:23:28.477 --> 01:23:31.145
Chris, I don't live
at Williamson.

01:23:31.147 --> 01:23:32.814
If I had told everybody...

01:23:33.581 --> 01:23:37.016
I would've been "poor Starr"
who saw her friend get killed.

01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:39.752
Or "Starr the charity case"
who lives in the ghetto.

01:23:39.754 --> 01:23:41.788
Do you think people really care
about where you live?

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:42.792
Yeah, I do.

01:23:43.992 --> 01:23:45.361
Geez.

01:23:49.499 --> 01:23:51.467
Have you ever seen
somebody die?

01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:56.472
No.

01:23:58.005 --> 01:23:59.575
Well, I have twice now.

01:24:03.077 --> 01:24:06.715
That's why my parents put me
and my brothers in Williamson.

01:24:08.284 --> 01:24:09.686
To protect us.

01:24:13.688 --> 01:24:14.691
And now...

01:24:16.959 --> 01:24:20.996
it's like I have to hide
who I am every single day.

01:24:21.897 --> 01:24:25.565
When I'm at home,
I can't be too Williamson.

01:24:25.567 --> 01:24:28.938
When I'm here, I can't act
too Garden Heights.

01:24:33.142 --> 01:24:34.977
Khalil was my first crush.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.947
My first kiss.

01:24:41.517 --> 01:24:44.487
And he was going through
so much shit...

01:24:45.254 --> 01:24:46.956
and I didn't even know...

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:49.659
because I turned
my back on him.

01:24:50.793 --> 01:24:53.595
I turned my back
on all of my people.

01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:01.370
Do you even know
what that's like?

01:25:04.572 --> 01:25:05.575
No.

01:25:08.376 --> 01:25:10.646
And I'm sorry, Starr.
I really am.

01:25:13.115 --> 01:25:15.518
But black, white...

01:25:16.317 --> 01:25:18.084
nobody gives a shit.
We're all the same.

01:25:18.086 --> 01:25:19.021
But we're not.

01:25:19.955 --> 01:25:21.288
Y'all wanna act black,

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:23.159
but you get to keep
your white privilege.

01:25:24.259 --> 01:25:26.260
You think playing ball
and jumping

01:25:26.262 --> 01:25:27.927
in some lame-ass
Williamson cypher

01:25:27.929 --> 01:25:29.962
makes you understand
what it is to be black?

01:25:29.964 --> 01:25:30.931
It doesn't.

01:25:30.933 --> 01:25:32.766
Starr, I just told you
I don't see color.

01:25:32.768 --> 01:25:35.636
I see people for who they are.
The exact same way I see you.

01:25:35.638 --> 01:25:38.174
If you don't see my blackness,
you don't see me.

01:25:46.814 --> 01:25:47.983
I see you.

01:26:03.331 --> 01:26:04.765
Hey, y'all better
not be doin' nothin'.

01:26:04.767 --> 01:26:06.967
- Oh, my God.
- I ain't playing.

01:26:06.969 --> 01:26:08.104
Seven!

01:26:29.723 --> 01:26:31.726
Aw, baby.

01:26:37.133 --> 01:26:38.867
I'm sorry prom got ruined.

01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:43.205
You kidding me? I don't give
a shit about prom.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.474
What I do give a shit about
are the burgers

01:26:47.476 --> 01:26:48.742
we're gonna eat after prom.

01:26:48.744 --> 01:26:51.514
And the milkshake.

01:26:53.048 --> 01:26:54.183
And the next part.

01:26:57.119 --> 01:26:58.487
What next part?

01:27:02.089 --> 01:27:03.525
I'm gonna take you home...

01:27:04.793 --> 01:27:06.896
and I'm gonna meet
your father.

01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:38.158
I suggest you get
some color real quick.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.531
I've got color on the inside,
where it counts.

01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:47.467
All right, man.

01:27:47.469 --> 01:27:49.368
Well, uh, I think it's time

01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:50.705
we test your black card.

01:27:51.773 --> 01:27:53.209
What you want for Thanksgiving?

01:27:54.442 --> 01:27:55.844
Sweet potato pie...

01:27:56.577 --> 01:27:58.078
or pumpkin?

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.578
Sweet potato pie. All day.

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.114
- Ding! Ding! Ding!
- Okay.

01:28:01.116 --> 01:28:02.681
- That's my baby right there.
- Okay. Hold up.

01:28:02.683 --> 01:28:04.320
- He knows what's up.
- We're not done.

01:28:05.454 --> 01:28:07.220
Mac and cheese.

01:28:07.222 --> 01:28:09.258
Full meal or side dish?

01:28:10.759 --> 01:28:12.592
Full meal.

01:28:12.594 --> 01:28:14.660
- Whomp, whomp, whomp!
- What?

01:28:14.662 --> 01:28:16.029
Mac and cheese
ain't no full meal, man.

01:28:16.031 --> 01:28:17.998
- Mnh-mnh.
- It's a meal out of a box.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.332
Oh, no, baby. No.

01:28:19.334 --> 01:28:20.667
It comes out the oven, bubbly,

01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:22.334
- cheesy, crispy on top.
- ...Yeah. Preach.

01:28:22.336 --> 01:28:23.837
Macaroni and cheese
is a protein.

01:28:23.839 --> 01:28:25.538
You sprinkle breadcrumbs
on top of it.

01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.440
- Breadcrumbs?
- You have to what?

01:28:27.442 --> 01:28:30.443
Oh, hell no. No.
That ain't gonna cut it.

01:28:30.445 --> 01:28:32.180
Y'all both dead. Excuse me.

01:28:39.353 --> 01:28:40.854
- Hey, Pops.
- What's up, man?

01:28:40.856 --> 01:28:43.422
Hey. Thanks for
bringing 'em home.

01:28:43.424 --> 01:28:44.927
Here you go.

01:28:46.528 --> 01:28:48.494
Oh, Daddy,
he doesn't need a tip.

01:28:48.496 --> 01:28:51.032
What? You gotta tip
the chauffeur.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.167
Hey, man.

01:28:53.169 --> 01:28:54.001
You better get out of here

01:28:54.003 --> 01:28:55.137
before someone steal your ride.

01:28:56.138 --> 01:28:58.504
Hey! Come in! Come in!

01:28:58.506 --> 01:28:59.976
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

01:29:01.108 --> 01:29:04.377
Chris! It's so nice
to finally meet you!

01:29:05.513 --> 01:29:06.879
How was prom?

01:29:06.881 --> 01:29:09.248
It was good. Yeah.
We came back a little early.

01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:10.218
Who's this?

01:29:11.353 --> 01:29:12.655
Daddy, this is Chris.

01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:15.357
Who's Chris?

01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:18.658
Chris is my boyfriend.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.095
You got a boyfriend?

01:29:21.162 --> 01:29:23.398
Well, who do you think
she went to prom with?

01:29:24.366 --> 01:29:26.235
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Carter.

01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:30.436
You got a white boyfriend?

01:29:30.438 --> 01:29:32.872
Uh, Daddy,
he's not my white boyfriend.

01:29:32.874 --> 01:29:34.677
He's just my boyfriend.

01:29:35.477 --> 01:29:36.879
That boy is white.

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.882
Well, um,
I'm sure everybody's tired.

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:44.818
Thank you so much, Chris,
for getting 'em home safe.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.519
And you know what?
I really look forward

01:29:46.521 --> 01:29:47.587
to seeing more of you soon.

01:29:47.589 --> 01:29:49.258
- No problem, Mrs. Carter.
- Yeah.

01:29:50.826 --> 01:29:52.662
Good night, Mr. Carter.

01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:56.229
- Good night, Starr.
- Good night.

01:29:56.231 --> 01:29:57.666
Yeah. Good night.

01:30:08.809 --> 01:30:10.211
You knew about this boy?

01:30:13.581 --> 01:30:14.916
You knew about this?

01:30:16.817 --> 01:30:18.753
Who the hell else
knew about this?

01:30:19.588 --> 01:30:20.723
Hold up.

01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:22.957
Does Sekani know about this?

01:30:26.594 --> 01:30:28.361
What the hell, Starr?

01:30:28.363 --> 01:30:30.529
You got a white boyfriend,
everybody know but me?

01:30:30.531 --> 01:30:32.168
I wonder why that is.

01:30:34.402 --> 01:30:36.101
What's this boy's name?

01:30:36.103 --> 01:30:37.370
Chris.

01:30:37.372 --> 01:30:38.307
Chris?

01:30:40.008 --> 01:30:42.411
What kinda plain-ass name
is that?

01:30:46.214 --> 01:30:49.084
Girls usually go with boys
who look like their daddy.

01:30:54.756 --> 01:30:56.256
Guess I ain't set
a good example

01:30:56.258 --> 01:30:57.793
of a black man for you.

01:31:00.362 --> 01:31:01.897
No, you didn't.

01:31:04.398 --> 01:31:07.436
You set a good example
of what a man should be.

01:31:10.138 --> 01:31:11.106
Duh.

01:31:17.077 --> 01:31:19.247
If this li'l boy
got you saying "duh"...

01:31:20.781 --> 01:31:22.485
he might have to go.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.995
Get down!

01:31:41.036 --> 01:31:42.538
Wait! No, no, no! Maverick!

01:31:44.339 --> 01:31:47.806
Tell Starr to keep
her mouth shut! Damn bitch!

01:31:47.808 --> 01:31:49.609
Damn it!

01:32:14.135 --> 01:32:15.435
Hey.

01:32:15.437 --> 01:32:16.535
Hey.

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:17.872
Come on inside.

01:32:32.454 --> 01:32:33.988
What are you doing? Come in.

01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:36.288
I'm goin' back.

01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:37.623
What?

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:38.891
Nobody messes with my family.

01:32:38.893 --> 01:32:40.325
Especially not King's boys.

01:32:40.327 --> 01:32:42.095
Your family is here!

01:32:42.097 --> 01:32:43.762
And this family is moving.

01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:45.199
I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:46.368
We're moving!

01:32:47.102 --> 01:32:48.467
I'm going with Daddy.

01:32:48.469 --> 01:32:50.569
Seven, get back in the house!

01:32:50.571 --> 01:32:52.739
Maverick, I am begging you.

01:32:52.741 --> 01:32:55.809
Don't go back.
What if King comes back?

01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:57.110
I hope he does.

01:32:57.112 --> 01:33:00.582
Maverick!
Maverick, you promised!

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:05.286
Daddy!

01:33:44.459 --> 01:33:47.092
<i>The eyewitness to
the shooting of Khalil Harris</i>

01:33:47.094 --> 01:33:50.129
<i>is set to testify tomorrow
before the grand jury.</i>

01:33:50.131 --> 01:33:51.530
<i>Local community leaders</i>

01:33:51.532 --> 01:33:53.766
<i>fear that the testimony
of the witness</i>

01:33:53.768 --> 01:33:55.836
<i>will not only increase
gang violence</i>

01:33:55.838 --> 01:33:58.437
<i>but also amplify tension
between local police</i>

01:33:58.439 --> 01:34:00.273
<i>and the Garden Heights
community.</i>

01:34:06.348 --> 01:34:09.782
Someone's trying to scare you
about the grand jury tomorrow.

01:34:09.784 --> 01:34:11.085
Did it work?

01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:17.356
Why do we need a grand jury

01:34:17.358 --> 01:34:19.294
to decide
if this should go to trial?

01:34:21.396 --> 01:34:22.828
Some people don't see
what happened

01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:24.564
to Khalil as a crime.

01:34:24.566 --> 01:34:27.534
They see it as
a traffic stop gone wrong.

01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:28.801
How?

01:34:28.803 --> 01:34:30.604
A lot goes through
a cop's mind

01:34:30.606 --> 01:34:31.904
when they pull someone over.

01:34:31.906 --> 01:34:33.306
Especially if they have
to get into

01:34:33.308 --> 01:34:35.074
a pissing contest
with the driver

01:34:35.076 --> 01:34:36.508
about why they stopped him.

01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:38.080
It sets off an alarm.

01:34:38.979 --> 01:34:40.281
The officer thinks...

01:34:41.282 --> 01:34:44.385
"Are they hiding somethin'?
Is the car stolen?"

01:34:45.554 --> 01:34:48.490
Now, if there's a girl in
the passenger seat like you...

01:34:49.558 --> 01:34:53.092
"Does she look all right?
Has she been beaten or raped?"

01:34:53.094 --> 01:34:54.993
If they start talking
to each other

01:34:54.995 --> 01:34:56.296
and not the officer,

01:34:56.298 --> 01:34:58.367
we figure they might be
trying to distract.

01:34:59.166 --> 01:35:01.467
What are they hiding
in the car?

01:35:01.469 --> 01:35:02.636
Drugs? A weapon?

01:35:02.638 --> 01:35:05.038
Now, if the driver starts
to insult the officer,

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.641
we try to verbally get control
of the situation.

01:35:07.643 --> 01:35:09.042
But if they still
don't comply,

01:35:09.044 --> 01:35:11.177
then we...
we have to use force.

01:35:11.179 --> 01:35:14.013
But you still don't know
if they did anything wrong.

01:35:14.015 --> 01:35:16.016
That's why we search them.

01:35:16.018 --> 01:35:18.551
To make sure that
they don't have a weapon.

01:35:18.553 --> 01:35:22.788
We run their license
and instruct them not to move.

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:24.692
But if they open the door...

01:35:25.927 --> 01:35:28.394
or reach through
an open window...

01:35:28.396 --> 01:35:30.963
they're probably goin'
for a weapon.

01:35:30.965 --> 01:35:32.633
So if I think I see a gun...

01:35:33.735 --> 01:35:36.037
I don't hesitate. I shoot.

01:35:36.804 --> 01:35:38.106
You shoot?

01:35:39.073 --> 01:35:41.074
Because you think
you see a gun?

01:35:41.076 --> 01:35:44.276
You don't say something first?
Like, "Put your hands up"?

01:35:44.278 --> 01:35:47.681
It depends.
Is it night? Can I see?

01:35:47.683 --> 01:35:48.980
Am I on duty alone?

01:35:48.982 --> 01:35:51.417
What if you were
in a white neighborhood?

01:35:51.419 --> 01:35:54.686
And it was a white man
wearing a suit,

01:35:54.688 --> 01:35:56.157
driving a Mercedes?

01:35:57.192 --> 01:35:59.425
He could be
a drug dealer, right?

01:35:59.427 --> 01:36:00.496
He could.

01:36:01.562 --> 01:36:03.431
So if you saw him...

01:36:04.265 --> 01:36:05.666
reach into the window...

01:36:07.001 --> 01:36:08.771
and you thought
that you saw a gun...

01:36:10.738 --> 01:36:12.040
would you shoot him?

01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:14.543
Or would you say,
"Put your hands up"?

01:36:18.211 --> 01:36:20.415
I'd say, "Put your hands up."

01:36:26.088 --> 01:36:27.656
Do you hear
what you just said?

01:36:33.228 --> 01:36:36.128
We live in
a complicated world, Starr.

01:36:36.130 --> 01:36:39.601
No. No, it doesn't seem
that complicated to me.

01:37:16.237 --> 01:37:18.270
I'll be out here
the whole time.

01:37:18.272 --> 01:37:22.342
And if you need to ask me
anything, that's your right.

01:37:22.344 --> 01:37:24.211
And your parents
will be here waiting.

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:25.647
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:37:28.849 --> 01:37:30.983
I love you so much.

01:37:30.985 --> 01:37:32.220
I love you.

01:38:00.514 --> 01:38:03.151
<i>Now state your name
for the grand jurors.</i>

01:38:04.486 --> 01:38:06.685
<i>My name
is Starr Amara Carter,</i>

01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:08.454
<i>and I'm 16 years old.</i>

01:38:08.456 --> 01:38:11.158
I'm going to be asking you
for a factual account

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.763
of what you saw the night
Khalil Harris was killed.

01:38:16.964 --> 01:38:18.765
<i>I will tell you everything.</i>

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:21.170
<i>I will tell you everything
and more.</i>

01:38:22.469 --> 01:38:24.472
<i>Khalil lost his mother
to crack.</i>

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.210
<i>Khalil loved to sing
even though he couldn't.</i>

01:38:29.878 --> 01:38:32.680
<i>Khalil ate at our house
for five years.</i>

01:38:35.049 --> 01:38:36.584
<i>Khalil never cried.</i>

01:38:39.454 --> 01:38:41.423
<i>Khalil wanted to go to Egypt.</i>

01:38:43.791 --> 01:38:46.059
<i>Khalil kissed me twice.</i>

01:38:46.061 --> 01:38:47.329
<i>Once on that night.</i>

01:38:48.262 --> 01:38:49.865
<i>Khalil didn't own a gun.</i>

01:38:50.799 --> 01:38:52.467
<i>Khalil owned a hairbrush.</i>

01:38:53.235 --> 01:38:55.603
<i>Khalil died
holding his hairbrush.</i>

01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:58.406
<i>And if Khalil
was still alive...</i>

01:39:00.608 --> 01:39:02.577
<i>he would be graduating
high school.</i>

01:39:29.036 --> 01:39:31.973
So, I guess you're not gonna
get over it anytime soon?

01:39:33.107 --> 01:39:34.740
Get over it?

01:39:34.742 --> 01:39:36.441
Yes. Get over it.

01:39:36.443 --> 01:39:40.245
You can't even see that
you're acting racist, huh?

01:39:40.247 --> 01:39:41.616
'Cause I'm not.

01:39:42.817 --> 01:39:44.550
It's all "our," and "us,"

01:39:44.552 --> 01:39:47.419
and "black lives matter, girl"
until you clutch your purse

01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:49.321
when you're in the elevator
with a black person.

01:39:49.323 --> 01:39:50.690
You don't need to use
the N-word

01:39:50.692 --> 01:39:52.291
and use a firehose
on black people

01:39:52.293 --> 01:39:53.695
to be racist, Hailey.

01:39:55.295 --> 01:39:56.597
You're different, Starr.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:39:58.763
I'm different?

01:39:58.765 --> 01:40:00.802
What, I'm
the nonthreatening black girl?

01:40:01.969 --> 01:40:03.972
Yeah. You are.

01:40:04.805 --> 01:40:07.843
Your friend wasn't.
He was a drug dealer.

01:40:09.442 --> 01:40:11.746
Someone was probably
gonna kill him eventually.

01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:13.980
Are you serious, Hailey?

01:40:13.982 --> 01:40:16.382
Yes. The officer did see
a weapon.

01:40:16.384 --> 01:40:19.454
- He saw a hairbrush.
- That looked like a weapon.

01:40:21.656 --> 01:40:23.088
What's this in my hand
right now?

01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:24.791
You're gonna tell me that
this looks like a weapon?

01:40:24.793 --> 01:40:26.295
In his hand, yes.

01:40:27.195 --> 01:40:28.863
What about in my hand?

01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:31.364
Huh?

01:40:31.366 --> 01:40:33.099
Huh? Does it look like
a weapon?

01:40:33.101 --> 01:40:34.600
Does it look like
a weapon now?

01:40:34.602 --> 01:40:36.334
Get on the ground! Now!

01:40:36.336 --> 01:40:38.637
Down on the ground
before I shoot you!

01:40:38.639 --> 01:40:39.672
Don't move!

01:40:39.674 --> 01:40:41.974
Don't move
before I shoot you with it!

01:40:41.976 --> 01:40:43.810
What the hell did I just say?

01:40:43.812 --> 01:40:46.311
Don't move! Hailey.

01:40:46.313 --> 01:40:47.915
Look at me and stop crying.

01:40:49.584 --> 01:40:51.653
That's what it's like.

01:41:06.567 --> 01:41:07.499
Starr.

01:41:07.501 --> 01:41:09.569
Hey. Starr, wait.

01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:10.936
- Starr, wait!
- What do you want?

01:41:10.938 --> 01:41:12.337
Hold on!

01:41:26.853 --> 01:41:27.619
Starr.

01:41:27.621 --> 01:41:29.556
Stop.

01:41:29.558 --> 01:41:32.494
Starr. Starr, stop.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:41:34.495 --> 01:41:36.465
Come here. Come here.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.936
I got you.

01:41:43.737 --> 01:41:44.805
I got you.

01:42:35.889 --> 01:42:37.825
Hey, Lyric. Where's Seven?

01:42:43.363 --> 01:42:44.663
- Starr!
- Shit!

01:42:44.665 --> 01:42:46.231
- What are you doing here?
- Where is it hurting?

01:42:46.233 --> 01:42:47.934
Y'all leave
before King comes back.

01:42:47.936 --> 01:42:49.401
He's looking for you.

01:42:49.403 --> 01:42:50.703
Nah, Seven. We're leaving.

01:42:50.705 --> 01:42:52.504
Come on, help me out.

01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:55.710
Come on. Let's go.

01:43:00.514 --> 01:43:02.582
Iesha, what happened?

01:43:02.584 --> 01:43:03.983
What happened?

01:43:03.985 --> 01:43:07.485
You snitched
and earned an ass whoopin'.

01:43:07.487 --> 01:43:09.191
My baby took it for you.

01:43:10.325 --> 01:43:13.758
Bleedin' all on my floor
and shit. Get him outta here.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.231
Take Kenya and Lyric
with you, too.

01:43:17.298 --> 01:43:19.000
Lyric? What?

01:43:20.134 --> 01:43:21.168
Y'all bothering me.

01:43:21.902 --> 01:43:23.772
Trying to get
my drink on and shit.

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.875
Go!

01:43:30.978 --> 01:43:31.913
Shit!

01:43:33.347 --> 01:43:34.646
Shit. King back.

01:43:34.648 --> 01:43:36.718
Y'all, come on.
Go out the back door!

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.453
- Iesha?
- Huh?

01:43:41.455 --> 01:43:42.857
Thank you.

01:43:53.934 --> 01:43:55.035
Hey, baby.

01:44:08.749 --> 01:44:10.048
We gotta get him
to a hospital.

01:44:10.050 --> 01:44:11.253
Make a left up here.

01:44:13.754 --> 01:44:15.620
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:15.622 --> 01:44:17.422
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:17.424 --> 01:44:19.391
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:19.393 --> 01:44:21.260
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:21.262 --> 01:44:22.727
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:25.099
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:26.034 --> 01:44:27.132
What's goin' on?

01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:32.070
- What?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:44:37.612 --> 01:44:38.847
Excuse me.

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.613
What happened?

01:44:40.615 --> 01:44:42.315
There's a protest
at City Hall.

01:44:42.317 --> 01:44:43.783
...people
always getting murdered.

01:45:04.104 --> 01:45:05.272
I'm sorry, Starr.

01:45:11.879 --> 01:45:12.948
Let's go.

01:45:14.214 --> 01:45:15.717
I wanna go. Now.

01:45:25.794 --> 01:45:27.793
Justice for Khalil!

01:45:27.795 --> 01:45:31.564
Justice for Khalil!
Justice for Khalil!

01:45:31.566 --> 01:45:35.168
Justice for Khalil!
Justice for Khalil!

01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:37.005
Justice for Khalil!

01:45:45.647 --> 01:45:47.413
Starr. Starr!

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:56.521
Hey, is it true?

01:45:56.523 --> 01:45:58.623
Cop goes free.
No trial, nothing.

01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:00.492
The grand jury didn't indict.

01:46:10.138 --> 01:46:11.339
Starr?

01:46:13.907 --> 01:46:15.807
They killed Khalil
for nothing!

01:46:15.809 --> 01:46:17.876
- Burn it down!
- We want justice for Khalil!

01:46:17.878 --> 01:46:19.778
- They keep killing us!
- Gonna arrest me? Then do it!

01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:21.113
No, Lyric shouldn't be here.

01:46:21.115 --> 01:46:22.517
Yeah, come on, Lyric.
Let's get outta here.

01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:25.217
Seven, you need
to get outta here, too.

01:46:25.219 --> 01:46:26.985
No, I'm staying right here.

01:46:26.987 --> 01:46:29.256
- But you're hurt.
- I'm fine.

01:46:30.857 --> 01:46:32.490
This is
what democracy looks like!

01:46:32.492 --> 01:46:34.526
This is what democracy
looks like!

01:46:34.528 --> 01:46:36.162
This is what democracy
looks like!

01:46:36.164 --> 01:46:38.396
This is what democracy
looks like!

01:46:38.398 --> 01:46:40.065
What do you need me to do?

01:46:40.067 --> 01:46:41.302
I wanna help.

01:46:49.076 --> 01:46:50.676
Take Lyric and Kenya,
get them outta here.

01:46:50.678 --> 01:46:52.345
Make sure they're safe, okay?

01:46:52.347 --> 01:46:53.744
Starr, I'm not
leaving you here.

01:46:53.746 --> 01:46:54.982
I'm not going anywhere.

01:46:56.217 --> 01:46:57.352
I need to be here.

01:46:58.585 --> 01:46:59.887
I'm good.

01:47:01.455 --> 01:47:02.424
Okay?

01:47:04.457 --> 01:47:05.524
Okay.

01:47:05.526 --> 01:47:06.827
Thank you.

01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:16.101
What do we want?

01:47:16.103 --> 01:47:17.368
Justice for Khalil!

01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:19.038
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.439
- What do we want?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:47:20.441 --> 01:47:22.074

- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:47:35.622 --> 01:47:37.455
- What do we want?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:47:37.457 --> 01:47:38.891
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:47:38.893 --> 01:47:40.426
- What do we want?
- Justice for Khalil!

01:47:40.428 --> 01:47:41.959
We ain't goin' nowhere!

01:47:41.961 --> 01:47:43.529
We're takin' it back.

01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:44.796
- Black power!
- That's right!

01:47:44.798 --> 01:47:46.765
And they killed Khalil
over nothin'!

01:47:46.767 --> 01:47:47.999
That's some bullshit!

01:47:49.603 --> 01:47:51.270
Yeah, light him up, Bulldog!

01:47:52.339 --> 01:47:53.705
Justice for Khalil!

01:47:53.707 --> 01:47:54.640
Justice for Khalil!

01:47:54.642 --> 01:47:56.641
Justice for Khalil!

01:47:56.643 --> 01:47:58.409
Justice for Khalil!

01:48:19.467 --> 01:48:21.900
<i>I hereby command

Think it's a joke?
