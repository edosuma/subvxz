Whoa. You okay?

00:40.548 --> 00:41.815
Yeah.

00:41.883 --> 00:44.484
I just saw this girl,
she was young,

00:44.552 --> 00:47.120
she was maybe 18,
and she was trapped

00:47.188 --> 00:49.189
in this burning building.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.825
Oh. Who you calling?
The fire department?

00:51.893 --> 00:53.693

00:53.761 --> 00:56.263
I didn't see an address.

00:56.297 --> 00:58.198
Oh.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.935
You know, I read something
interesting the other day.

01:02.003 --> 01:04.304
Do you know that
the average person

01:04.372 --> 01:06.306
has six dreams a night?

01:06.374 --> 01:08.108
No, I did not know that.

01:08.175 --> 01:10.744
What exactly does that
have to do with anything?

01:10.811 --> 01:14.381
That's six dreams a night,
42 dreams a week,

01:14.448 --> 01:17.884
168 dreams a month,
and that's, what...

01:17.952 --> 01:20.420
2,016 every year.

01:20.488 --> 01:22.155
I don't under...

01:22.223 --> 01:24.391
And I know that you're
you and everything,

01:24.458 --> 01:27.394
but even you don't have 2,016
meaningful dreams a year.

01:27.461 --> 01:29.462
Some of the things
that you dream about,

01:29.530 --> 01:31.565
most of them, actually,
have to be just...

01:31.632 --> 01:35.669
you know, regular...
run-of-the-mill dreams.

01:35.736 --> 01:38.305
What? A girl trapped
in a burning building--

01:38.372 --> 01:40.006
you actually think
that's run-of-the-mill?

01:40.074 --> 01:43.276
And what am I supposed
to do, just ignore it?

01:43.344 --> 01:46.947
If you weren't, don't you think
you would've seen an address?

01:51.018 --> 01:54.421
Yeah. I... I guess you're right.

02:57.609 --> 03:00.010
Well, it doesn't surprise me
that De La Vega's attorneys

Well, they

about <i>something.</i>

Wilfredo Soto's here
to review his testimony.

03:43.321 --> 03:44.989
Sure. I didn't realize

03:45.040 --> 03:47.024
that we were interviewing
more interns.

03:47.075 --> 03:48.709
Hm? Oh, no, actually,
they're here interviewing

03:48.793 --> 03:50.627
for the new A.D.A. position.

03:50.695 --> 03:54.264
I managed to squeeze some money out of
the budget so we can try and lighten

03:54.332 --> 03:56.633
the load around here.
You're kidding!

03:56.701 --> 03:58.035
They're assistant D.A.'s?

03:58.086 --> 04:00.004
They look like children,
not attorneys.

04:00.071 --> 04:01.638
They're both--
they're the only ones

04:01.706 --> 04:05.376
that'll work for
the money we're offering.

04:11.516 --> 04:13.550
Allison Dubois, this
is Wilfredo Soto.

04:16.521 --> 04:19.156
Mr. District Attorney,
I thought I made myself clear

04:19.223 --> 04:21.158
when I agreed to testify.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.060
We need to avoid new faces.

04:23.128 --> 04:24.862
Everyone I meet
is one more person

04:24.929 --> 04:27.398
who can tell
De La Vega where I am.

04:27.465 --> 04:29.900
And I assured you that I would
keep the number of people

04:29.968 --> 04:33.070
you work with to a minimum, but I
can't eliminate them entirely.

04:33.138 --> 04:36.273
Mrs. Dubois is a consultant who
helped assemble De La Vega's jury.

04:36.341 --> 04:39.209
Her sense of how they'll react
to your testimony is essential.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.171
So, shall
we begin?

05:09.307 --> 05:11.742
I think he's already
been targeted.

05:11.810 --> 05:14.161
I think somebody's already
been hired to kill him.

05:14.245 --> 05:16.280
Targeted? By who?

05:16.347 --> 05:19.800
I have no idea-- all I can tell you is,
the instant that I saw our witness,

05:19.884 --> 05:22.586
I saw this man open a suitcase full of
money and surveillance photographs.

05:22.654 --> 05:26.056
Well, can you describe this man, the one
you think's being paid to kill my witness?

05:26.124 --> 05:29.693
Perhaps generate a sketch,
uh, something I can give

05:29.761 --> 05:32.996
to Soto's security people.
Yeah, sure.

05:34.182 --> 05:35.999
Lynn, you wanted
to see me?

05:36.067 --> 05:38.018
Yeah, the mayor
asked me to stop by

05:38.103 --> 05:40.170
and ask you a
couple of questions.

05:40.238 --> 05:42.239
Sure. Ask away.

05:42.307 --> 05:45.442
So, you going to win this thing
and put that monster away?

05:45.510 --> 05:47.644
I like our chances.

05:47.712 --> 05:50.080
What's the <i>next</i> question?

05:50.148 --> 05:53.317
We were wondering how you'd feel
about being the mayor of Phoenix.

05:55.753 --> 05:58.388
The mayor's gonna make
a bid for governor,

05:58.456 --> 06:00.557
and when he does, he'd
like to endorse someone

06:00.625 --> 06:03.026
to run for his spot--
and that someone is you.

06:12.804 --> 06:15.672
You're supposed to tell me
how honored you are.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.642
I... I'm honored, of course.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.578
I'm just...

06:21.646 --> 06:23.447
surprised.

you're ready to fight for it.

06:32.357 --> 06:34.691
As soon as it's out there that
the mayor's stepping down,

06:34.759 --> 06:36.927
people are gonna be throwing
their hats in the ring.

06:36.995 --> 06:39.062
We know John Barnes
from City Planning wants it.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.264

06:42.400 --> 06:44.501

06:45.537 --> 06:47.504
No, it's just...

06:47.572 --> 06:49.673
our wives are good friends.

06:49.741 --> 06:51.542
Well, tell your wife to make

06:51.609 --> 06:52.676

07:04.022 --> 07:05.956
and talk to my wife.

new A.D.A.'s today.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.671
Mm-hmm. So?

07:20.738 --> 07:23.574
So, they were really young.

07:23.641 --> 07:25.342
Really? How young?

07:25.410 --> 07:28.512
I don't know, like, 27, 28.

07:28.579 --> 07:31.582
Mm. That sounds
about right, right?

07:31.649 --> 07:33.583
They graduate at 21,

07:33.635 --> 07:35.586
three years of law school,

07:35.653 --> 07:37.854
and three or four more
in private practice,

it's not about that at all.

07:46.931 --> 07:48.498

that they're young;

07:48.566 --> 07:50.534
maybe it's that I'm not.

still older than you

than you right now--

08:05.316 --> 08:07.050

10:47.856 --> 10:49.890
There was a fire

10:49.958 --> 10:53.194
and Wilfredo Soto
was the only fatality?

10:53.261 --> 10:54.528
Fire started in the wall

10:54.596 --> 10:57.064
of the unoccupied room
one floor below.

10:57.132 --> 10:59.433
A dozen or so hotel guests
are being treated

10:59.501 --> 11:01.168
for smoke inhalation
and minor burns,

11:01.236 --> 11:04.105
but Soto's the only one
who died.

11:04.172 --> 11:06.374
The man was in that hotel
for protective custody.

11:06.441 --> 11:08.009
He was surrounded

11:08.076 --> 11:09.977
How is such a thing
possible, Lee?

11:10.045 --> 11:11.579
Well, according
to the fire investigator,

11:11.646 --> 11:13.881
an electrical fire started
in a wall outlet.

11:13.949 --> 11:17.351
It burned the plastic insulation
on the wiring inside the wall.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.320
That plastic created
hydrogen cyanide

11:19.388 --> 11:22.556
and carbon monoxide fumes
that traveled up the vent

11:22.624 --> 11:24.925
and into his room.

11:24.993 --> 11:27.461
Soto was apparently asleep
when the smoke entered the room,

11:27.529 --> 11:29.096
but this stuff's so toxic,

11:29.164 --> 11:32.333
one or two inhales
gets the job done.

11:32.401 --> 11:36.103
The bottom line-- it was
an accident, pure and simple.

11:36.171 --> 11:37.271
Okay, I'll ask again.

11:37.339 --> 11:38.506
Where was his protective detail

11:38.573 --> 11:40.508
when that room was filling full
of smoke

11:40.575 --> 11:42.276
and my witness was choking
to death?

11:42.344 --> 11:44.779
I was told we had
the entire floor to ourselves.

11:44.846 --> 11:45.946
We did.

11:46.014 --> 11:47.381
One agent was making his rounds.

11:47.449 --> 11:50.217
Two more in the next room,
plus a man at every exit.

11:50.285 --> 11:53.020
When the smoke alarms went off,
they all rushed into the room

11:53.088 --> 11:55.156
just as the fire was breaking
through the walls,

11:55.223 --> 11:56.624

a spotless safety record.

12:04.199 --> 12:05.499
Nobody could have foreseen this.

12:07.536 --> 12:11.205
Okay, so, where does this
leave us with the case?

12:43.588 --> 12:45.055
Coffee. Black.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.541
Thank you for coming.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.927
Hey. I'm a lowly councilman.

12:50.011 --> 12:51.929
My office is in a strip mall.

12:52.013 --> 12:54.548
I get an invite from somebody
like the District Attorney,

12:54.616 --> 12:55.850
I'm here.

12:57.219 --> 12:59.753
Now if this is about, um,
firming our Christmas plans,

12:59.821 --> 13:01.889
I told my wife
to tell your wife

13:01.957 --> 13:03.557
that it's your
turn to pick.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.959
I just want to ski.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.995
I doesn't matter to me what
the name of the mountain is.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.430
No, it's not about that.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.731
Have you heard anything

13:10.782 --> 13:13.801
about the mayor taking a run
at the governor's race?

13:13.869 --> 13:16.036
Maybe.

13:16.104 --> 13:18.405
I know you want out
of that strip mall.

13:19.641 --> 13:21.842
I'm guilty, Counselor.

13:21.910 --> 13:25.246
The mayor's not planning
on endorsing somebody,

13:25.313 --> 13:27.248
and I haven't
heard that he has,

13:27.315 --> 13:29.150
and I might take
a run at it.

13:29.217 --> 13:32.520
Who knows? If I make enough
noise, maybe he'll endorse me.

13:32.587 --> 13:34.221
That's why I wanted
to see you.

13:34.289 --> 13:36.290
Thank you.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.594
He's asked me to run, Benito,

13:40.662 --> 13:42.696
and he's offered me
his endorsement.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.818
Well, that makes sense.

13:48.904 --> 13:50.271
So, that's it, huh?

13:50.338 --> 13:52.373
Actually, I...

13:52.440 --> 13:54.441
I haven't made
a decision yet.

13:56.011 --> 13:57.211
What about you?

13:57.278 --> 13:59.547
Does this...
change anything?

14:01.216 --> 14:04.218
Like you said, I want
out of that strip mall.

14:06.588 --> 14:09.423
I consider you a friend, Benito.

14:09.491 --> 14:10.958
Our wives are best friends...

14:11.026 --> 14:12.526
Well, that's not
going to change.

14:12.594 --> 14:13.861
I'm just concerned.

14:13.929 --> 14:15.796
Things have been said.

14:15.847 --> 14:17.865
Confidences shared.

14:19.301 --> 14:21.602
What does that have to
do with being mayor?

14:21.670 --> 14:23.037
Nothing.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.672
Absolutely nothing.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.707
I just... I just...

14:26.775 --> 14:30.177
I want this campaign
to stay focused on the issues.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.716
Hey, I would never take
advantage of our friendship,

14:35.784 --> 14:37.318
or our wives' friendship.

14:37.385 --> 14:39.887
Anything that she might
know, that I might know,

14:39.955 --> 14:42.122
is strictly off-limits.

14:42.190 --> 14:44.858
Thank you
for saying that, Benny.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.395
And knowing that you feel
that way, I'm inclined to do it.

14:48.463 --> 14:51.999
There's no one
I'd rather run against.

14:52.067 --> 14:54.101
Thanks.

14:54.169 --> 14:56.136
I meant what I said.

14:56.204 --> 14:58.806
I would never say anything.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.642
But reporters
and bloggers--

15:01.710 --> 15:04.211
they love looking for trash.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.880
And you never know what rock
they're gonna look under

15:06.948 --> 15:08.882
till they get it.

15:08.950 --> 15:13.754
Just, uh, something
to keep in mind.

15:13.822 --> 15:16.023
Right.

15:16.091 --> 15:18.092
Duly noted.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.267
Excuse me?

15:26.334 --> 15:28.085
Morning. Can I help you
with something?

15:28.169 --> 15:29.386
My name's Allison Dubois.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.871
I'm with the District
Attorney's office.

15:30.922 --> 15:32.873
I'm here to pick up
the official report

15:32.941 --> 15:34.608
on the fire at
the Chapman Hotel.

15:34.676 --> 15:36.343
Let me take a look
in his office.
Okay.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.512
Thanks.

16:03.638 --> 16:05.923
Here you go.
That's the report.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.409
And I made a copy for you,
so you can take that with you.

16:08.476 --> 16:09.743
Great. Thanks.
Yeah.

16:09.811 --> 16:12.646
Um, all these people--
did they all die in fires?

16:12.714 --> 16:13.981
Yeah.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.883
Yeah, this is tradition
here at the 55th.

16:15.950 --> 16:18.786
Some of these pictures go
all the way back to the '60s.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.105
Who's this girl?

16:21.189 --> 16:23.657
Can you tell me what
happened to her?

16:23.725 --> 16:24.958
Honestly, I have no idea.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.560
I just transferred
into the company.

16:26.628 --> 16:28.662
That's why they've got
me waxing the trucks

16:28.730 --> 16:30.297
while everyone else
is out training.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.799
Oh.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.600
Uh, speaking of which, if you
don't need anything else...

16:33.668 --> 16:36.370
No, no, I'm all set.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.241
It happened a little
over a year ago.

16:41.309 --> 16:43.644
Her name was Charlotte Spencer.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.447
This article says
that she was squatting

16:46.514 --> 16:49.249
in an abandoned building
downtown when the fire started.

16:49.317 --> 16:51.018
Okay.

16:51.086 --> 16:52.419
I don't understand.

16:52.487 --> 16:54.655
I saw her get rescued,
not killed.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.856
Did you actually see
the two of them

16:55.924 --> 16:57.024
walking out of the building?

16:57.092 --> 16:58.158
No.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.027
Then you didn't see 'em

17:00.095 --> 17:01.461
getting rescued, did you?

17:02.497 --> 17:04.765
I'm confused.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.367
This happened
a year ago?

17:06.434 --> 17:08.167
Why does any of
this matter?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.069
I don't know.
I keep dreaming about it.

17:10.137 --> 17:11.538
There's got to be a reason.

17:11.606 --> 17:14.708
Six dreams a
night, my dear.

17:14.776 --> 17:17.611
42 dreams a week.

17:17.679 --> 17:20.781
168 dreams every month.

18:10.998 --> 18:13.006
He's the captain
of Engine Company 55.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.234
His name is Frank Davenport.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.069
He's the man I saw taking money

18:16.137 --> 18:18.071
to execute Wilfredo Soto.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.909
So he's a fireman
<i>and</i> a contract killer?

18:21.976 --> 18:25.045
He's a contract killer who uses
fire to get away with murder.

18:25.113 --> 18:27.481
And Wilfredo Soto was not
his first kill.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.349
I dreamt
about him killing this girl.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.784
First she thought

18:30.852 --> 18:32.953
he was there
to rescue her, but then,

18:33.021 --> 18:34.254
he stopped her from leaving

18:34.322 --> 18:36.323
till she choked
to death on the smoke.

18:36.391 --> 18:38.091
You see, he sets the fires,

18:38.159 --> 18:39.826
and then,
because he's a fireman,

18:39.894 --> 18:42.496
he's there to make sure
that his victim doesn't survive.

18:42.563 --> 18:45.098
Allison, I-I read
the same fire report you did,

18:45.166 --> 18:46.767
and the city's
arson investigator said

18:46.834 --> 18:48.635
that there's no doubt
in his mind

18:48.703 --> 18:50.804
that the fire
that killed Soto was accidental.

18:50.872 --> 18:52.940
Well, I know, but who better
to make a fire look

18:53.007 --> 18:54.541
like an accident
than someone who's around it

18:54.609 --> 18:55.742
every day?

18:55.810 --> 18:56.977
Look, I don't know
Davenport personally,

18:57.045 --> 18:58.812
but I do know him by reputation,

18:58.880 --> 19:00.514
and apparently,
he's the real deal.

19:00.581 --> 19:03.383
First guy through the door
at a fire, last one out.

19:03.451 --> 19:05.953
Well, of course. He's got to be
the first one through the door.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.121
He's got to make sure his target
doesn't get out alive.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.556
You know, I checked into it.

19:09.624 --> 19:12.159
His fire company was the first
to arrive at the scene

19:12.226 --> 19:13.927
of the fire
that killed Wilfredo Soto

19:13.995 --> 19:16.263
and the one that killed
Charlotte Spencer.

19:16.331 --> 19:17.664
Okay.

19:17.732 --> 19:20.100
Okay, let's say you're right.

19:20.168 --> 19:22.302
Frank Davenport's
a contract killer who--

19:22.370 --> 19:25.072
for the right price-- will use
fire to eliminate a target.

19:25.139 --> 19:28.976
Now, Wilfredo Soto was a man
with a price on his head,

19:29.043 --> 19:31.611
and Davenport certainly
had the means, the expertise,

19:31.679 --> 19:33.747
and the opportunity
to execute him

19:33.815 --> 19:35.082
without raising
too many eyebrows.

19:35.149 --> 19:36.783
But what about this woman?

19:36.851 --> 19:38.151
What about
Charlotte Spencer?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.654
According to this article,
she was destitute.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.290
A runaway who was squatting
in an abandoned building

19:43.358 --> 19:45.392
because she had no place else
to go.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.928
If Davenport is this high-priced
killer for hire,

19:47.996 --> 19:50.664
who would have paid his fee
to see her dead?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.766
I'm not sure yet.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.302
I just know what I saw.

20:06.714 --> 20:09.549
Excuse me.

20:09.617 --> 20:12.085
You're the lady
with the D.A.'s office, right?

20:13.287 --> 20:14.421
I'm-I'm Frank Davenport.

20:14.489 --> 20:16.022
I'm the captain here.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.794
Look, one of my guys told me
you were looking at some files.

20:20.862 --> 20:23.597
That you seemed interested
in that fire that happened

20:23.664 --> 20:25.899
at the abandoned building
on Jefferson last year.

20:25.967 --> 20:28.001
That's right.

20:28.069 --> 20:31.438
Well, may I ask why
the D.A's office is interested

20:31.506 --> 20:32.873
in that particular fire?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.842
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.511
Okay.

20:37.578 --> 20:39.813
It's just...

20:39.881 --> 20:42.182
It's just, you know, I...

20:43.351 --> 20:45.402
I have a particular interest
in that fire.

20:45.486 --> 20:47.587
I mean, my daughter died
in that fire.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.058
You didn't know that?

20:51.125 --> 20:55.395
Wait. In-in this file, it says
the only victim was a girl

20:55.463 --> 20:56.663
named...
Charlotte Spencer.

20:56.730 --> 20:59.466
I know. She was born
Charlotte Davenport.

20:59.534 --> 21:01.868
Spencer's her stepdad's name.

21:03.571 --> 21:05.572
Look, honestly...

21:07.241 --> 21:09.242
...I didn't know Charlotte
really at all

21:09.310 --> 21:11.611
the last few years
of her life, okay?

21:11.679 --> 21:15.415
I mean, my split with her mom
messed her up pretty good.

21:17.118 --> 21:19.586
She ran away from home
when she was 15.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.688
Lived on the streets

21:21.756 --> 21:23.757
till the day she died.

21:28.796 --> 21:30.030
The night of that fire,

21:30.131 --> 21:32.265
I-I... I...

21:32.333 --> 21:34.968
I didn't even realize
it was her.

21:35.036 --> 21:36.803
I mean, I saw the body.

21:36.871 --> 21:39.473
I just assumed
it was some vagrant.

21:41.109 --> 21:43.610
Some street kid, you know?

21:45.546 --> 21:47.781
Anyway, um...

21:49.383 --> 21:51.852
...if you're here today
'cause you have

21:51.919 --> 21:54.421
some new information
about Charlotte...

21:54.489 --> 21:56.957
I mean, if there's anything...

21:57.024 --> 21:59.259
that you know
that might help me,

21:59.327 --> 22:02.529
help my wife
know what happened,

22:02.597 --> 22:05.031
I guess...

22:05.099 --> 22:07.968
I'd be curious to know.

22:11.172 --> 22:14.691
Well, we did have some new
information, Captain Davenport,

22:14.775 --> 22:19.045
but now that I've
looked over the file, I think...

22:19.113 --> 22:22.916
I'm pretty sure
it's bad information.

22:22.984 --> 22:25.418
I-I'm pretty sure
that we don't have

22:25.486 --> 22:27.187
anything important to tell you.

22:27.255 --> 22:29.623
Okay. I see.

22:31.092 --> 22:32.659
I'm very sorry

22:32.727 --> 22:33.894
about your daughter.

22:33.961 --> 22:34.961
Yeah.

22:35.029 --> 22:37.497
Appreciate that.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.432
Okay.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.035
Okay. Thanks.

22:55.183 --> 22:57.584
You used to tell
me everything.

22:59.871 --> 23:03.089
The mayor calls,
offers you his job,

23:03.157 --> 23:05.725
and I hear about it
from Christina?

23:07.428 --> 23:09.129
Is this not reason
to celebrate?

23:09.197 --> 23:11.364
Of course it is.

23:12.533 --> 23:15.035
Of course it is.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.803
So, Christina
told you, huh?

23:16.871 --> 23:20.340
Mm. She heard it
from Benito.

23:20.408 --> 23:21.675
I acted like I knew.

23:21.742 --> 23:23.310
I figured you
were in court

23:23.377 --> 23:25.378
and you couldn't
use your phone.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.552
Manuel, what's going on?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.487
You accepted, didn't you?

23:34.555 --> 23:36.590
Not yet.

23:36.657 --> 23:40.360
I wanted to think about it,
and I wanted to talk with you.

23:40.428 --> 23:41.928
And Benito.

23:41.996 --> 23:44.531
And Benito, yeah.

23:44.599 --> 23:46.933
You're not gonna make
this easy, are you?

23:47.001 --> 23:50.337
Lily, if I do it...

23:50.404 --> 23:52.105
I want to win.

23:52.173 --> 23:54.241
You'll win.

23:55.876 --> 23:58.111
Who'd run
against you?

23:58.179 --> 24:01.381
Benito, for one.

24:01.449 --> 24:03.950
That's what you're
worried about?

24:04.018 --> 24:05.852
Benito?

24:06.887 --> 24:08.188
Oh...

24:08.256 --> 24:09.856
I love him to death,

24:09.924 --> 24:14.027
but he barely kept his seat on
the city council last term.

24:14.095 --> 24:18.131
You don't seriously think he could
compete with you in a mayoral election?

24:18.199 --> 24:21.034
I'm not really worried
about losing to him.

24:21.102 --> 24:25.105
I'm... I'm just worried
about what he'd do to win.

24:30.311 --> 24:31.511
Lily...

24:31.579 --> 24:33.546
think about it.

24:33.614 --> 24:35.548
Think about
everything he knows.

24:35.616 --> 24:38.918
Think about... all the things
that you've told Christina

24:38.986 --> 24:40.987
and Christina's told him.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.130
Everything you went through
after... Arianna died.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.368
What I went through?

24:57.805 --> 25:00.940
My daughter killed herself.

25:01.008 --> 25:03.943
My doctor gave
me some pills.

25:04.011 --> 25:05.612
They worked.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.717
And you kept on taking them...

25:10.785 --> 25:13.153
even after he stopped
prescribing them.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.422
And then we realized
you had a problem,

25:15.489 --> 25:17.957
and you went away
and you dealt with it.

25:18.025 --> 25:21.194
And doing that
was monumental.

25:21.262 --> 25:23.596
I know that,
you know that,

25:23.664 --> 25:26.866
and Christina knows it.

25:26.934 --> 25:29.336
And I'm pretty damn sure
that Benito knows it--

25:29.403 --> 25:31.404
I'm just not sure
that he cares.

25:32.673 --> 25:34.441
What are you talking about?

25:34.508 --> 25:35.842
He's our friend.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.912
He's your best
friend's husband.

25:38.979 --> 25:41.047
And what he lacks
in character,

25:41.115 --> 25:43.049
he makes up in
ruthless ambition.

25:43.117 --> 25:46.419
And you're right, a race between
us would be no race at all,

25:46.487 --> 25:49.022
so he'd have to distract
everyone from his poor record.

25:49.090 --> 25:52.425
He'd have to run
a negative campaign.

25:52.493 --> 25:56.396
Lily, he's gonna dredge up
our daughter's suicide...

25:56.464 --> 25:58.498
and he's going
to tell everything

25:58.566 --> 26:02.569
that we went through in the wake of it,
I guarantee it.

26:06.474 --> 26:08.141
Let him.

26:19.754 --> 26:23.189
Then take your
hands off me.

26:34.835 --> 26:36.369
Wh-What are you doing?

26:36.437 --> 26:38.371
Lily, where
are you going?

26:38.422 --> 26:42.976
I'm gonna try and pour this
champagne back into the bottle.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.249
Can you not
think so loud?

26:49.316 --> 26:53.186
Sorry. I'll try
to keep it down.

26:53.254 --> 26:56.189
Do you know the other night
when you said that my dream

26:56.257 --> 26:58.825
was... meaningless?

26:58.893 --> 27:01.795
The one about the girl
and the fireman.

27:01.862 --> 27:04.431
We having a
conversation?

27:04.498 --> 27:08.501
'Cause as hard as it is falling
asleep when you're thinking,

27:08.569 --> 27:12.005
it's next to impossible when
you're actually talking to me.

27:12.072 --> 27:14.641
I know.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.476
Just, it wasn't
really meaningless.

27:16.544 --> 27:18.545
"Meaningless" isn't
the right word.

27:18.612 --> 27:20.814
It was kind of reckless.
Oh.

27:20.881 --> 27:23.416
Okay, you got it--
reckless, it is.

27:23.484 --> 27:25.418
No, not the dream.

27:25.486 --> 27:27.420
The dream isn't reckless.

27:27.488 --> 27:31.157
Me. Chasing a dream,
trying to make sense of it.

27:31.225 --> 27:33.226
<i>I</i> was reckless.

27:34.462 --> 27:36.596
In a sense, you were right.

27:36.664 --> 27:38.832
I didn't see the time,
I didn't see the place--

27:38.899 --> 27:40.834
I should've just
left it alone.

27:40.901 --> 27:43.403
Sorry, I'm lost-- what
are we talking about?

27:43.471 --> 27:44.804
The <i>girl.</i>

27:44.872 --> 27:47.474
The one that I
saw the fireman try to save

27:47.541 --> 27:51.544
and then saw the fireman,
you know, try to kill her.

27:51.612 --> 27:54.047
Well, I met him today.

27:54.114 --> 27:56.115
The fireman is her father.

27:56.183 --> 27:58.384
The fireman who killed
her was her father?

27:58.452 --> 28:00.553
No, he didn't kill her;
nobody killed her.

28:00.621 --> 28:01.921
The fire killed her.

28:01.989 --> 28:05.491
I... I mean, the subject
of death came up,

28:05.543 --> 28:08.194
and... he's her father--

28:08.262 --> 28:11.030
you should have seen
his face, his eyes.

28:11.098 --> 28:13.766
I mean, he was
clearly just...

28:13.834 --> 28:17.103
destroyed by her loss.

28:19.139 --> 28:21.074
I was just so wrong.

28:21.141 --> 28:24.210
I should've just left
well enough alone.

28:24.278 --> 28:27.747
All I did today was dredge up
a bunch of awful memories

28:27.815 --> 28:29.249
and create some new pain

28:29.316 --> 28:33.219
for somebody who's clearly
had more than their share.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.289
Hey, do you think
it's too late

28:36.357 --> 28:37.924
to call our daughter?

28:37.992 --> 28:40.660
New Hampshire? Yes.

28:40.728 --> 28:42.495
Come here.

28:42.563 --> 28:44.264
What is... what
are we doing?

28:44.331 --> 28:45.899
I was, um, just hoping

28:45.966 --> 28:50.436
that maybe we could have some
meaningless dreams together.

28:50.504 --> 28:52.639
Hm? And then it
would be morning,

28:52.706 --> 28:54.874
and then we could
call our daughter.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.476
Mm-hmm.

28:56.544 --> 28:58.044
Hm?

29:01.715 --> 29:04.183
Give it to me.

29:04.251 --> 29:05.919
Right now, college
boy-- come on,

29:05.986 --> 29:07.353
don't make me
ask you again.

29:07.421 --> 29:09.656
Good. Now, uh,
put your card back in

29:09.723 --> 29:12.058
and, uh, take out everything
that's left in your account.

29:12.126 --> 29:14.327
But-but that was everything
I had left in my account.

29:14.394 --> 29:15.695
Please...

29:15.763 --> 29:17.564
please, I am not lying--
my parents control the account.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.399
They only put
a hundred bucks in a week.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.900
Check the receipt
if you don't believe me.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.769
It'll show you
there's nothing left.

29:24.421 --> 29:26.973
I'm sorry I don't have more--
I'd give it to you if I did.

29:27.041 --> 29:28.841
But my bike's right over
there if you want it.

29:28.909 --> 29:31.177
What the hell am I supposed to
do with your bike, man? Huh?

29:31.245 --> 29:33.513
What am I supposed to do with
a hundred bucks and your bike?!

29:33.581 --> 29:36.248
How am I supposed to get me and
my girlfriend our drugs tonight, huh? Huh?

29:37.134 --> 29:38.518
Huh?! Answer me,
college boy!

29:38.585 --> 29:40.954
How am I supposed
to get us our drugs?!

29:41.021 --> 29:42.522
Eddie, stop!
Please!

29:42.590 --> 29:43.990
He gave us everything he has.

29:44.058 --> 29:45.758
Let's just take it and go.

29:58.191 --> 30:00.292
Was it something I said?

30:02.028 --> 30:04.062
Mm. It's 3:17
in the morning.

30:04.130 --> 30:05.664
I roll over, there's
nobody there

30:05.732 --> 30:07.566
on the other side
of the bed.

30:07.633 --> 30:08.834
What are you doing, huh?

30:08.902 --> 30:10.435
What's going on?

30:10.503 --> 30:13.138
That girl, the one
who died in the fire.

30:13.206 --> 30:15.974
Turns out she was involved
in a robbery at gunpoint.

30:16.042 --> 30:18.844
So I dreamt about it,
and then I found it here.

30:18.912 --> 30:20.879
That's her-- that's
Charlotte Spencer.

30:20.947 --> 30:23.482
That's the girl
who died in the fire.

30:23.550 --> 30:25.951
Can you really be sure?

30:26.019 --> 30:28.453
She's been dead over a year
now-- it'd be kind of hard

30:28.521 --> 30:31.323
to arrest her at this
point, don't you think?

30:31.374 --> 30:35.093
I'm just saying, is this really
worth losing sleep over?

30:35.161 --> 30:37.396
I mean, even if the
girl in that picture

30:37.463 --> 30:39.932
is the girl that you've been
dreaming about, so what?

30:39.999 --> 30:41.600
It doesn't change
anything, does it?

30:41.668 --> 30:43.702
I mean, is her father
any more likely

30:43.770 --> 30:47.005
to kill her just because
she was a petty criminal?

30:47.073 --> 30:49.741
No disrespect, this is
all very interesting,

30:49.809 --> 30:52.010
I just don't think that
it's very meaningful.

30:52.078 --> 30:54.346
Come on, shut
that thing down.

30:54.414 --> 30:56.949
Let's get back to bed.

31:02.655 --> 31:03.922
Lily...

31:03.990 --> 31:05.857
what-what are you doing
out of bed?

31:05.925 --> 31:07.559
It's the middle of the night.

31:07.627 --> 31:10.028
Are you a coward?
What?

31:10.096 --> 31:13.365
Did I marry a coward?
I need to know.

31:13.433 --> 31:15.434
Lily, you're talking
nonsense-- get in bed.

31:15.501 --> 31:19.871
Manuel, as God is my witness,
I have never done anything

31:19.923 --> 31:22.874
that I was... ashamed of.

31:22.926 --> 31:26.345
I-I had some regrets...

31:26.396 --> 31:28.880
but nothing I'd ever deny.

31:28.948 --> 31:30.749
And up until
about six hours ago,

31:30.817 --> 31:33.318
I would have said
the same thing about you.

31:35.989 --> 31:38.090
Would it really
humiliate you

31:38.157 --> 31:40.492
if everything I went
through were to come out?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.928
Is that why you won't run?

31:42.996 --> 31:45.764
Because it wouldn't
humiliate me.

31:50.169 --> 31:53.171
Our daughter killed herself.

31:55.341 --> 31:58.410
That's just a fact.

31:58.478 --> 32:00.879
And we had to keep on living.

32:03.283 --> 32:07.152
And I, for one,
have nothing to hide.

32:10.223 --> 32:12.858
Maybe you're right.

32:12.925 --> 32:14.893
Maybe I am a coward.

32:14.961 --> 32:17.129
But I just can't
bear the thought

32:17.196 --> 32:20.732
of that... man trifling
with our memories,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.901
using the tragedies
we've endured

32:22.969 --> 32:25.304
as a weapon against us.

32:28.441 --> 32:31.343
Then you get a weapon.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.048
Manuel?

32:36.115 --> 32:37.916
Benito.

32:37.984 --> 32:39.818
Thank you.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.253
Thank you for coming by.

32:41.321 --> 32:43.288
I have a trial starting
in 20 minutes,

32:43.356 --> 32:46.258
but I couldn't bear the thought
of doing this over the phone.

32:46.326 --> 32:47.492
No problem.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.994
Like I said the other day,

32:49.062 --> 32:51.096
the district attorney
calls, I jump.

32:51.164 --> 32:53.432
At least for the moment.

32:53.499 --> 32:57.803
I wanted you to be
the, um, third to know.

32:57.870 --> 32:59.404
After a great deal
of consideration,

32:59.472 --> 33:02.274
I've decided to accept
the mayor's endorsement.

33:02.342 --> 33:04.509
I'll announce
my candidacy tomorrow.

33:04.577 --> 33:06.578
Hmm.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.581
I'm surprised, Manuel.

33:09.649 --> 33:12.718
I've always known you
to be a thoughtful man.

33:12.785 --> 33:14.286
A careful man.

33:14.354 --> 33:16.254
I don't sense you've
been very thoughtful

33:16.322 --> 33:18.423
or careful about
this decision.

33:18.491 --> 33:20.175
And what about Lily?

33:20.259 --> 33:22.544
You honestly think
that she's up for this?

33:22.628 --> 33:24.463
You said it yourself
the other day.

33:24.530 --> 33:27.265
This could be all
very... unseemly.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.368
I appreciate your concern,
Benito, but I've learned

33:29.435 --> 33:31.136
to never underestimate my wife.

33:31.204 --> 33:32.704
I think she'll do just fine.

33:32.772 --> 33:34.072
And besides, we're friends.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.608
And I know that we're both
committed to running campaigns

33:36.676 --> 33:38.110
that focus strictly
on the issues.

33:38.177 --> 33:40.345
Absolutely. Of course.
Good.

33:40.413 --> 33:41.980
Then it's hard to imagine

33:42.048 --> 33:45.884
that, uh, Lily or Christina will
have anything to worry about.

33:45.952 --> 33:47.219
Christina? Worried?

33:48.488 --> 33:49.988
Let me tell you a secret.

33:50.056 --> 33:51.823
My Christina's a bit of a ham.

33:51.891 --> 33:54.159
I think she's actually
gonna enjoy the whole thing.

33:54.227 --> 33:56.228
Well, good for her.

33:59.632 --> 34:01.099
You know, I'm actually jealous
of our wives.

34:01.167 --> 34:02.868
The way they've come
to depend on each other.

34:05.471 --> 34:09.306
Lily confiding her deepest
secrets to Christina,

34:09.375 --> 34:11.342
and vice versa.

34:11.411 --> 34:13.478
Oh, my goodness.

34:13.545 --> 34:16.214
The district attorney
is a card player.

34:16.282 --> 34:18.183
Fine.

34:18.251 --> 34:21.085
I'm gonna call your bluff

34:21.154 --> 34:24.856
and raise you four months
of falsified prescriptions

34:24.924 --> 34:27.592
and six months
at Betty Ford.

34:27.659 --> 34:30.896
And I'm not even going
to mention your daughter.

34:30.963 --> 34:32.898
Very well.

34:32.965 --> 34:36.134
And I'll see you
with $25,000 of municipal funds

34:36.202 --> 34:38.703
that paid for an abortion
and hush money for--

34:38.771 --> 34:42.174
what did you call her--
a campaign aide?

34:42.241 --> 34:43.942
Spoke with her
last night.

34:44.010 --> 34:45.210
Lovely young lady.

34:45.277 --> 34:48.079
Very articulate.

34:51.918 --> 34:54.152
Anyway...

34:54.219 --> 34:56.121
I'm due in court.

34:56.188 --> 34:58.757
Just wanted
to share the good news with you.

35:19.445 --> 35:22.214
What the hell you think
you're doing?!

35:22.281 --> 35:24.649
Mr. Foley, sorry.
I didn't think you were home.

35:24.717 --> 35:27.986
Frank Davenport,
Engine Company 55.

35:28.054 --> 35:30.489
You want to tell me
why you're in my basement?

35:30.556 --> 35:33.592
We got a call there might be
a gas leak in this house.

35:33.659 --> 35:35.560
I mean, I knocked,
and no one answered,

35:35.628 --> 35:37.629
so I figured,
under the circumstances,

35:37.697 --> 35:39.397
I should get
inside, have a look.

35:39.465 --> 35:40.966
You guys do that?

35:41.033 --> 35:43.068
Just break into someone's home?

35:43.135 --> 35:45.637
Well, when we smell gas.

35:45.705 --> 35:48.373
What's in the container?

35:48.441 --> 35:49.524
Oh, it's, uh...
it's just water.

35:49.609 --> 35:50.876
You know, run it
along the pipes.

35:50.943 --> 35:52.410
If it bubbles,
we know there's a leak.

35:52.478 --> 35:55.480
Doesn't smell
like water.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.277
Here. See for yourself.

36:30.662 --> 36:33.413
Allison. Can I help you?

36:33.481 --> 36:34.882
Sorry, sir. I didn't realize

36:34.949 --> 36:36.617
you were
in the middle of something.

36:36.668 --> 36:37.818
No, it's all right.

36:37.886 --> 36:39.953
We might be in here
for a while, though.

36:40.021 --> 36:41.188
Is it urgent?

36:41.256 --> 36:42.856
I think it might be.

36:42.924 --> 36:45.125
His name is Aaron Foley.

36:45.193 --> 36:46.660
He was about
to be indicted

36:46.728 --> 36:47.961
on corruption and
embezzlement charges.

36:48.029 --> 36:49.129
He was killed

36:49.197 --> 36:51.331
when he came upon an
intruder in his basement.

36:51.382 --> 36:53.267
Somebody was trying to
burn down his house.

36:53.334 --> 36:56.019
I think that somebody
was Frank Davenport.

36:56.104 --> 36:59.439
But Allison,
we can't prove that.

36:59.507 --> 37:01.008
Well, actually,
I think we can.

37:01.075 --> 37:03.110
When the police showed up
at Foley's basement,

37:03.177 --> 37:04.511
they found the killer's DNA.

37:04.579 --> 37:06.013
<i>There was blood on the floor.</i>

37:06.080 --> 37:07.314
<i>Foley had skin</i>

37:07.382 --> 37:08.849
under his fingernails.

37:08.917 --> 37:10.951
Of course, nobody connected it
with Davenport.

37:11.019 --> 37:12.786
He's a fireman, he's a hero.

37:12.853 --> 37:14.655
But when he realized

37:14.722 --> 37:17.224
that his daughter had been
caught on tape robbing that man,

37:17.292 --> 37:19.293
he knew it was just
a matter of time

37:19.360 --> 37:20.494
before the police arrested her.

37:20.562 --> 37:22.129
And when they did,

37:22.196 --> 37:24.665
her DNA would go
into the system.

37:24.732 --> 37:27.334
And it would be compared
to all the DNA samples

37:27.385 --> 37:30.704
that we find in all
the unsolved crimes in our file.

37:30.772 --> 37:32.139
And the Foley murder
would come up.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.574
It would be a slightly
imperfect match.

37:33.641 --> 37:35.392
It would be the kind
of match you get

37:35.476 --> 37:36.643
when you've got
the right family,

37:36.711 --> 37:37.811
but the wrong family member.

37:37.879 --> 37:39.413
Familial DNA.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.981
That's why
he killed his daughter.

37:41.049 --> 37:42.249
He had to.

37:42.317 --> 37:43.717
With her out-of-control life,

37:43.785 --> 37:46.086
he knew it was
only a matter of time

37:46.154 --> 37:47.654
before she led us to him.

37:47.722 --> 37:49.856
Now what do we
do about it?

37:49.908 --> 37:52.392
What do you mean?

37:52.460 --> 37:53.627
Davenport's a firefighter

37:53.695 --> 37:55.195
with a record
of distinguished service.

37:55.263 --> 37:57.798
I can't compel him
to give us a DNA sample

37:57.865 --> 37:59.499
just on your say-so.

37:59.567 --> 38:01.568
So can't you just
have him followed?

38:01.636 --> 38:03.570
Come on.

38:03.638 --> 38:05.973
He'll-he'll throw something
away with his DNA on it.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.109
A soda can, a plastic utensil.

38:09.177 --> 38:11.878
Allison, the Firefighter's Union
would crucify me if they knew

38:11.930 --> 38:14.514
I was tailing one of their own
without probable cause.

38:14.582 --> 38:16.600
Not to mention,
that any decent defense attorney

38:16.684 --> 38:18.452
would have a field day in court

38:18.519 --> 38:22.122
if we tried to go to trial
with a DNA sample that we snuck

38:22.190 --> 38:23.457
onto the record.

38:23.524 --> 38:24.825
He killed his own daughter.

38:24.892 --> 38:27.427
I know. I know
you believe that,

38:27.495 --> 38:29.496
and I'm inclined
to think you're right,

38:29.564 --> 38:31.865
but at the moment,
we just can't prove it.

38:31.933 --> 38:34.801
I'm sorry.

38:38.606 --> 38:39.957
Hello?

38:40.041 --> 38:41.274
Mrs. Spencer?

38:41.342 --> 38:42.943
Hello. My name is
Allison Dubois.

38:43.011 --> 38:45.345
I'm with
the District Attorney's office.

38:45.413 --> 38:48.215
I was hoping to speak with you
about your daughter Charlotte.

38:48.282 --> 38:51.918
You're telling me you think
my ex murdered my daughter?

38:51.986 --> 38:53.387
Our daughter?

38:53.454 --> 38:54.888
I'm telling you,

38:54.956 --> 38:56.757
I think your ex-husband
made himself available

38:56.824 --> 39:00.394
to people with money who wanted
someone done away with.

39:00.461 --> 39:01.728
Yes.

39:01.796 --> 39:03.563
I don't think he did it often,

39:03.631 --> 39:06.466
but I think when he did it,
he was very well-paid.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.135
Does any of this make sense?

39:08.202 --> 39:10.504
Does any of it ring
any kind of bells?

39:10.571 --> 39:12.773
Is that a serious question?

39:14.575 --> 39:16.610
This house.

39:16.678 --> 39:19.146
Is this the house
the two of you shared?

39:19.213 --> 39:22.282
He gave it to me
in the divorce. Why?

39:22.350 --> 39:25.385
Is this the house
of a city worker?

39:25.453 --> 39:27.154
A fireman?

39:29.257 --> 39:31.024
What is it you want?

39:31.092 --> 39:34.461
I need something of Charlotte's.

39:34.529 --> 39:38.031
Maybe something that you saved.

39:38.099 --> 39:42.169
Some of her old clothing,
or maybe an old toy,

39:42.236 --> 39:47.174
or anything that could possibly
have her DNA left on it.

40:39.327 --> 40:42.195
It was from her first haircut.

40:45.032 --> 40:47.100

<i>District Attorney</i>
<i>Manuel Devalos,</i>

41:05.253 --> 41:07.788
<i>who has long sought a</i>
<i>conviction against De La Vega,</i>

41:07.855 --> 41:09.556
<i>made a surprise announcement.</i>

41:09.624 --> 41:11.124
I am humbled
by the mayor's endorsement,

41:11.192 --> 41:13.860
and I am honored to ask
the people of this great city

41:13.928 --> 41:15.462
to choose me to fill his shoes.

41:15.530 --> 41:17.097
Mr. Devalos, we have
some questions.

41:17.165 --> 41:18.598
Mr. District Attorney?

41:18.666 --> 41:20.200
Mr. District Attorney?
Mr. District Attorney?

41:20.268 --> 41:22.035
Mr. District Attorney,
do you have any comment...?

41:30.244 --> 41:31.945
Now, this one's
almost done.

41:32.013 --> 41:33.346
She's in college.

41:33.414 --> 41:35.715
The ones you're supposed
to be looking in on

41:35.783 --> 41:38.018
are in the other room.

41:39.821 --> 41:41.788
Seems like
every time I turn around,

41:41.856 --> 41:43.857
someone's moving on
with their life.

41:45.526 --> 41:47.627
Ariel's at college.

41:47.695 --> 41:51.331
Devalos is running for mayor.

41:51.399 --> 41:54.100
♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes. ♪

41:54.168 --> 41:56.236
That's the way of
the world, my dear.

41:56.304 --> 41:59.973
Hey, you know,
if Devalos does become mayor,

42:00.041 --> 42:02.175
I may not have a job.

42:02.243 --> 42:04.010
Why do you say that?

42:04.078 --> 42:05.812
Well because, if he's mayor,

42:05.880 --> 42:07.814
he's not gonna have
any use for me.

42:07.882 --> 42:11.484
And who's to say the next D.A.
is gonna want to have me around?

42:11.552 --> 42:13.153
I mean, I'm not a lawyer.

42:13.221 --> 42:14.588
Let's recap.

42:14.655 --> 42:17.290
You just solved a series
of unsolved murders

42:17.358 --> 42:19.259
and put a contract killer,

42:19.327 --> 42:22.729
who passed himself off
as a hero, behind bars.

42:22.797 --> 42:25.298
And now, filled
with a sense of achievement

42:25.366 --> 42:27.100
and accomplishment,
you've decided

42:27.168 --> 42:29.269
to stare into your daughter's
unoccupied room

42:29.337 --> 42:31.137
and muse about all the things

42:31.205 --> 42:33.106
that could go wrong
with your life.

42:33.174 --> 42:36.877
Allison, you're an inspiration
to manic depressives everywhere.

42:39.247 --> 42:41.448
I want to go back to school.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.383
I want to get my law degree.

42:43.451 --> 42:45.986
I'll-I'll just do it
a little bit at a time.

42:46.053 --> 42:48.188
I know full-time
doesn't makes sense, but...

42:48.256 --> 42:51.758
I want to go back to school.

42:52.793 --> 42:54.561
Will you marry me?

42:54.629 --> 42:56.529
We <i>are</i> married.

42:56.597 --> 42:58.164
Then I suppose you can go.

42:58.232 --> 42:59.833
Can we go to bed first?

43:02.837 --> 43:05.138
This is such an easy yes.
