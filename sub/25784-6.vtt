11:23.396 --> 11:25.813
I don't care what you say.
I'm not going out with him.

11:25.896 --> 11:27.646
- Thank you.
- Issa: Hm.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.855
It's a shame to be
all closed-minded
and ignorant.

11:30.938 --> 11:32.312
- Wow.
- Issa: I'm just sayin',
sometimes,

11:32.396 --> 11:33.896
people can surprise you.

11:33.980 --> 11:37.312
Like Nathan! He surprised
the shit out of me.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.646
Is Nathan the black one?

11:38.730 --> 11:40.604
Kelli, can you learn
a nigga's name for once?

11:40.688 --> 11:42.021
You are not fuckin' my man.

11:43.062 --> 11:44.479
Uh, excuse me? Your "man"?

11:44.563 --> 11:46.688
- Ugh, did I say that?
- Yes.

11:46.771 --> 11:48.563
- Out loud.
- My bad.

11:49.688 --> 11:52.271
OK, I gue-- I guess I'm happy!

11:52.354 --> 11:54.938
I don't know, he's the first guy
I've been into since Lawrence,

11:55.021 --> 11:57.688
and in a real way,
not a Daniel way.

11:57.771 --> 12:00.855
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.
Issa, that's huge.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.271
Black love.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.980
Yeah, Nathan is pretty great.

12:05.062 --> 12:07.771
And, he's like super supportive
of my projects, too.

12:07.855 --> 12:09.771
What projects you doin'?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.187
Should I tell y'all?

12:11.271 --> 12:13.021
Yeah, I'll tell y'all!

12:13.104 --> 12:16.521
So, I'm about to throw
a block party.

12:16.604 --> 12:18.187
And I got a lot of work to do.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.187
But I already know
where I want it to be,

12:20.271 --> 12:23.271
and I got a business name!

12:23.354 --> 12:27.312
"Musiqal, Inc." But "musical"
with a "Q,"

12:27.396 --> 12:30.688
'cause we put together events
"quickly."

12:30.771 --> 12:33.396
( both laughing, snorting )

12:33.479 --> 12:36.896
- Molly: Wait, was you--?
- You were so confident
when you said it!

12:36.980 --> 12:38.563
- Y'all laughing
out of support, or--?
- Molly: "Quickly."

12:38.646 --> 12:40.771
"Quickly" change the name!

12:40.855 --> 12:42.354
Oh, you're-- you're cute.

12:42.438 --> 12:44.521
- Kelli: Oh...
- Molly: "With a 'Q'"!

12:44.604 --> 12:46.146
- Molly: Oh, you mad?
- She mad!

12:46.229 --> 12:48.146
What, hold up. You know
that's crooked, right?

12:49.271 --> 12:50.980
Damn, it is.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.938
Yeah, we should get
to the shower early tomorrow

12:53.021 --> 12:54.312
to help Tiffany set up
and shit.

12:54.396 --> 12:57.062
You right. Kelli,
you find anything good

12:57.146 --> 12:58.563
in that Gladys Knight
cookbook yet?

12:58.646 --> 13:00.021
What do y'all think of these?

13:00.104 --> 13:01.563
Do these cupcakes say,

13:01.646 --> 13:04.396
"Congratulations
on your light-skinned baby"?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.688
Right? 'Cause it's all light.
Every layer is light.

13:06.771 --> 13:07.980
But then there are little
chocolate bits,

13:08.062 --> 13:10.521
to remind him,
you still a nigga.

13:11.604 --> 13:13.312
- Makes sense.
- I can see it.

13:13.396 --> 13:15.396
Fuck, nigga!
You made the calls?

13:15.479 --> 13:17.312
You never make the calls.

Look that shit up.

13:18.938 --> 13:20.229
Ohh!

13:20.312 --> 13:22.730
It's just...
it's embarrassing, man.

13:22.813 --> 13:24.312
I mean, I'm 32 years old.

13:24.396 --> 13:26.813
Can't keep doin' this shit.

13:26.896 --> 13:29.062
You know, it's gotta be...
more to my life

13:29.146 --> 13:31.855
than just goin' to work
and fuckin'.

13:31.938 --> 13:33.896
No, man, you're good.
And I'm good, too.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.771
Got a California King
all to myself.

13:35.855 --> 13:37.813
You know the bitch
never used to make the bed?
I had to.

13:37.896 --> 13:39.312
I ignored the signs.
That's my fault.

13:39.396 --> 13:42.438
You titty-fucked two strippers.
That's your fault.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.271
Yeah, look, it's OK
if you hurt, man. I know how--

13:45.354 --> 13:47.229
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

13:47.312 --> 13:49.479
No, no, I'm good.
I'm doin' great.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.646
I'm unbothered.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.146
Happy. Everything
happens for a reason.

13:54.229 --> 13:56.688
- ♪ The reasons
that we're here ♪
- Don't do that.

13:56.771 --> 13:58.396
There's Derek.
What up, Derek?

13:58.479 --> 13:59.896
Don't touch my food,
please.

13:59.980 --> 14:01.521
You can't catch it
through fries, nigga.

14:01.604 --> 14:03.021
That's what you say.

14:03.104 --> 14:04.271
Hey, Daddy.

14:04.354 --> 14:06.980
Nope. Not gonna say it
like that again.

14:07.062 --> 14:08.229
What's up, though, man?

14:08.312 --> 14:10.062
How you feelin'?

14:10.146 --> 14:12.312
Yeah-ha,

14:12.396 --> 14:13.604
I feel good.

14:13.688 --> 14:15.354
Life is a fuckin' champion,

14:15.438 --> 14:18.312
and I'll be
a dope-ass father, man.

14:18.396 --> 14:19.646
That's what's up.

14:19.730 --> 14:21.938
I was gonna be
a dope-ass husband too,

14:22.021 --> 14:23.396
but you know, Leah
was all over the place.

14:23.479 --> 14:25.187
That's why I had to
cut her ass loose.

14:25.271 --> 14:27.146
- Chad, she broke up with you.
- That's your perspective.

14:27.229 --> 14:29.021
- You cheated on her.
- I apologized.

14:29.104 --> 14:30.312
She can take a nigga back.

14:30.396 --> 14:32.146
Lawrence.
Would you take Issa back?

14:32.229 --> 14:33.813
Hell, naw.

14:33.896 --> 14:36.771
You know what I'm sayin',
I'm not.... mad anymore.

14:36.855 --> 14:38.146
I just...

14:38.229 --> 14:40.229
I can't not see her
as a cheater.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.980
Mm-hm. Tell it. Hmph.

14:43.062 --> 14:45.980
Chad, didn't you do
the same thing Issa did?

14:46.062 --> 14:47.980
Yeah, but she a ho.

14:48.062 --> 14:50.563
She's not a ho.
She just did some ho shit.

14:54.271 --> 14:56.354
You know your boy
got chlamydia?

14:56.438 --> 14:58.104
Ha! What?

14:58.187 --> 15:00.187
- Could you not--
- What?

15:00.271 --> 15:02.271
- "Had." Had.
- Got.

15:02.354 --> 15:03.521
It's part of
your story now.

Ooh, what if I did

You think the city
would just turn a blind eye

15:15.646 --> 15:17.104

Well, that's why I got you.

16:19.521 --> 16:23.563
Oh, no. The Crazy Crew
just wanted to get here

16:23.646 --> 16:26.730

20:30.896 --> 20:32.938
That's-- That's big.

20:33.021 --> 20:34.688
It feels like it.

20:37.438 --> 20:40.354
And, you know, I'm...
workin' on this new thing.

20:40.438 --> 20:43.354
Yeah, it's like, I'm tryin'
to throw a block party.

20:43.438 --> 20:45.354
For real?

20:45.438 --> 20:46.855
I'm still figuring it out,

20:46.938 --> 20:49.021
so... I'm workin' on it.

20:49.104 --> 20:51.104
I kinda get
how challenging it is

20:51.187 --> 20:52.438
to do something on your own.

20:52.521 --> 20:55.604
So... you workin' on
a business plan?

20:55.688 --> 20:57.688
( laughs )

20:57.771 --> 20:59.479
If you need my help, I--

20:59.563 --> 21:02.938
No, you right, I am, I am.
It's so much paperwork.

21:03.021 --> 21:05.521
- I bet a lot of permits, too.
- I don't fuck with permits.

21:05.604 --> 21:08.187
We gonna party
till they kick us out.

21:08.271 --> 21:11.104
- Actually, I really need
those permits.
- Yeah.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.896
Yo, so....

21:14.980 --> 21:17.646
it's hard,
steppin' out on your own.

21:17.730 --> 21:21.187
Yeah.
How are things with you?

21:22.396 --> 21:23.938
Good. Yeah, you know,

21:24.021 --> 21:25.354
just takin' things easy.

21:25.438 --> 21:27.229
They're giving me
more to do at work.

21:27.312 --> 21:29.521
My projects
are going great.

21:29.604 --> 21:31.771
And, you know,
they still give me

21:31.855 --> 21:33.563
those free
triple XL t-shirts.

21:33.646 --> 21:35.187
( laughs )
Good one.

21:35.271 --> 21:37.021
They go down to here.

21:37.104 --> 21:38.730
Lawrence, it's--

21:39.980 --> 21:42.229
You really have
your shit together.

21:42.312 --> 21:43.813
I'm proud of you.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.896
Yeah. Thanks.

21:46.980 --> 21:49.187
You know, I'm--
I'm tryin'.

21:49.271 --> 21:53.646
By the way, if you know anyone
that can help me

21:53.730 --> 21:56.604
with this whole business shit,
I would really appreciate it.

21:56.688 --> 21:58.938
- All right.
- Thank you.

21:59.021 --> 22:00.563
Yeah.

22:00.646 --> 22:02.396
You played this game yet?

22:02.479 --> 22:04.438
No, not yet.
What is it?

22:04.521 --> 22:06.062
- Are these diapers?
- I dunno--

22:06.146 --> 22:07.229
Ohh!

22:07.312 --> 22:08.396
Whoa!

22:08.479 --> 22:10.438
( sniffs )
Is that chocolate?

22:10.521 --> 22:11.688
You should try that.

22:11.771 --> 22:14.104
- No!
- A little bit.

22:14.187 --> 22:16.521
- I was about to say
you  try it.
- Oh, no, but I think

22:16.604 --> 22:18.604
Tiffany would appreciate it
if you tried it.

22:18.688 --> 22:21.062
- You're full of shit.
- No, you are about to be...

22:21.146 --> 22:22.813
( Lawrence, Issa laughing )

22:22.896 --> 22:24.813
...full of shit.

22:24.896 --> 22:26.062
Go ahead.

22:28.855 --> 22:30.187
Hey.

22:31.604 --> 22:33.396
Are we talkin' now?

22:33.479 --> 22:34.646
It's cool?

22:34.730 --> 22:37.312
I mean, our boundaries
and all, right?

22:37.396 --> 22:39.604
For real?
Is this how we gonna start?

22:39.688 --> 22:41.563
I'm just sayin'.

22:44.438 --> 22:48.479
You know what? Thank you
for the reminder that this shit
was a waste of time.

22:48.563 --> 22:50.688
Yup.

Molly:
Hey, Kelli.

22:59.021 --> 23:01.563
So what you're saying is,
you're not gonna
put out my cupcakes?

23:01.646 --> 23:03.271
Do you know how long it takes
to make a healthy version

23:03.354 --> 23:07.438
of this butterscotch-
caramel-egg custard
chocolate shit?

23:07.521 --> 23:09.938
Sorry, Kelli, the table
only has room for one
signature dessert.

23:10.021 --> 23:13.146
So you're saying no
to Gladys Knight's cupcakes.

23:13.229 --> 23:15.938
You better Midnight Train
these muthufuckas to the table.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.479
- Kelli.
- Ahmal: Wow!

23:17.563 --> 23:21.021
Is that the official cake?
Nobody else
should ever try.

23:21.104 --> 23:23.187
- Issa told me
you can't read.
- OK.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.771
Molly:
Hey, hey, hey, Kelli.

23:24.855 --> 23:27.855
So you know,
we're here for Tiffany...

23:27.938 --> 23:32.021
We're all going to gather
in the next room for gifts.

23:32.104 --> 23:35.688
Oh! Are these
backup cupcakes?

23:35.771 --> 23:36.771
Yay!

23:38.938 --> 23:41.021
- "Backup."
- No. Mm-mm. Kelli!

23:41.104 --> 23:43.312
She don't know
what she sayin'.

23:43.396 --> 23:45.354
Kelli, wait!

23:45.438 --> 23:47.938
You can't leave,
it'll just make things worse!

23:48.021 --> 23:50.187
You don't get it
because you have Issa,
OK?

23:50.271 --> 23:53.187
Just let me go.
Tiffany won't even
notice I'm gone.

23:53.271 --> 23:55.730
- That's not true, Kelli.
- It is  true. OK?

23:55.813 --> 23:57.438
And I'm not tryin'
to be selfish,

23:57.521 --> 23:59.521
but I'm losin' my best friend
to a goddamn baby.

23:59.604 --> 24:03.563
- Why does that baby hate me?
- The baby does not hate you.

24:03.646 --> 24:05.563
It do! That baby do!

24:05.646 --> 24:07.563
What are y'all
doin' out here?

24:07.646 --> 24:09.187
Why weren't we
on your planning committee?

24:09.271 --> 24:12.062
Yeah, I mean,
we're closer to you
than Blair.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.730
You could have at least
included us.

24:14.813 --> 24:16.646
Hold up.

24:16.730 --> 24:20.271
None of y'all even offered
to throw me a baby shower.

24:20.354 --> 24:22.438
As a matter of fact,
Blair asked, and I held off,

24:22.521 --> 24:25.938
hoping that one of you would,
and you didn't.

24:26.021 --> 24:27.896
My life was all over the place.

24:27.980 --> 24:31.062
I was crashin' at Daniel's,
I was broke, you know, I--

24:31.146 --> 24:33.479
- And I was switchin' jobs.
- Tiffany: So?

24:33.563 --> 24:35.896
I'm having my first child.

24:35.980 --> 24:38.688
We're always
gon' have life shit.

24:38.771 --> 24:42.896
Well, even if we asked,
it wasn't like you was
gonna let us plan it.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.813
Of course not,
but I still would have
let us fake do it together.

24:45.896 --> 24:49.271
OK, I agree, these bitches
whack as fuck.

24:49.354 --> 24:52.104
But when I asked you,
you said you had it handled.

24:54.021 --> 24:56.521
Blair asked to do it,
and, you know, she's a mother,

24:56.604 --> 24:58.980
so I just thought
she'd be helpful.

24:59.062 --> 25:02.563
So because I don't have a baby,
I couldn't do that for you?

25:06.688 --> 25:08.271

25:40.563 --> 25:43.187

I don't know.

I mean, Tiffany's
over here on first baby,

25:45.563 --> 25:47.521
I'm not even on first date.

25:47.604 --> 25:50.521
Well, you said
you didn't have time
to date right now

25:50.604 --> 25:52.980
and you weren't checkin'
for Andrew, so...

25:53.062 --> 25:55.730
Bitch, can you stop
quoting my quotes?

25:56.980 --> 25:58.563
How was Lawrence?

26:00.563 --> 26:04.563
You know what?
It was cool.

26:04.646 --> 26:08.438
I think I'm finally...
over him?

26:09.896 --> 26:11.688
Wow.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.813
- Really?
- I mean, I love him

26:14.896 --> 26:17.354
and I always will, but...

26:17.438 --> 26:19.563
it's time to move on.

26:20.688 --> 26:22.855
Well, cheers to that.

26:22.938 --> 26:25.104
Nathan better know
how lucky he is.

26:25.187 --> 26:28.187
Candice:
Hey, everybody!
Sorry I'm late.

26:28.271 --> 26:30.312

26:30.396 --> 26:33.021

26:33.104 --> 26:35.521
- Oh, hey!
- Hey! Hi!

26:35.604 --> 26:38.646
OK, so, did I miss everything?
God, I hope I missed everything.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.604

26:40.688 --> 26:43.855
No, no, you're just in time
for gifts.

26:43.938 --> 26:45.354
Oh! Perfect.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.312
Oh, you two are having
a little moment...

26:47.396 --> 26:50.730
- Oh, no.
- I got a moment with Issa,
like, every day.

26:50.813 --> 26:53.229
Looks like a moment.
Let me go say hey to Tiff.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.896
( Issa, Molly laughing )

26:54.980 --> 26:57.187
Oh, hey!

26:57.271 --> 26:59.021
You good?

27:26.479 --> 27:28.813
I saw you and Iss talking.

27:28.896 --> 27:31.604
Yeah, man, you know, uh,

27:31.688 --> 27:33.771
I knew I was gonna
see her today,

27:33.855 --> 27:36.104
but, uh, it just--
it felt different.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.688
You know, she's different.

27:38.771 --> 27:40.604
That's cool.

27:40.688 --> 27:43.521
Tiffany: Daddy?
Mommy needs you!

27:43.604 --> 27:46.312
Yeah.

when she say it.

27:46.396 --> 27:48.563
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:48.646 --> 27:51.896
- I'm tired. We're slavin'.
- Girl.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.104

have to do that.

27:54.187 --> 27:55.438

We got it.

27:55.521 --> 27:56.938
Where's Kelli?

27:57.021 --> 28:00.396
Uh, I think I saw her leave
like 30 minutes ago.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.646
Oh.

28:04.354 --> 28:08.479
Uh, yeah. She said
she had to get up early
for work or somethin'.

28:08.563 --> 28:10.229
- Um, yeah.
- Molly: Mm-hm.

28:10.312 --> 28:13.187
Yeah. She did say that earlier.

28:13.271 --> 28:14.479
About work.

28:14.563 --> 28:15.980
Mm-hmm.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.563

Kelli does not play
about her money.

28:19.646 --> 28:23.271
She be like, (gruff voice):
"Bitch, where's my money?!"

28:24.312 --> 28:25.813
In that voice?

28:25.896 --> 28:27.646
That's how she sounds to me.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.563
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

28:29.646 --> 28:32.396
And Tiffany, I just
have to say that this was
a lovely shower.

28:32.479 --> 28:36.604
- So great.
- You are gonna make
a phenomenal mom.

28:36.688 --> 28:38.187
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

28:38.271 --> 28:40.479
Thank you, girl.

28:40.563 --> 28:42.229
Speaking of babies,

28:42.312 --> 28:45.521
Molly, why didn't you tell me
Candice and Dro
are having a baby?

28:45.604 --> 28:48.146
- What?
- You ain't know?

28:48.229 --> 28:50.813
Oops.
Not my news to share.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.354
But oops, she did tell me
at my baby shower,

28:53.438 --> 28:55.271
so who's stealin' whose thunder?

28:55.354 --> 28:56.438
Huh!

28:57.896 --> 28:58.855

I'm sorry, girl.
That nigga is--

29:01.062 --> 29:02.563

29:02.646 --> 29:05.021
I'm sorry,
I gotta take this.

29:12.771 --> 29:14.646
- Hello?
- Woman: Hi. Ms. Dee?

29:14.730 --> 29:16.938
- Yes.
- We thought
you'd like to know

29:17.021 --> 29:18.771
that we've closed
the investigation.

29:18.855 --> 29:21.396
We spoke to Nathan Campbell,
and he gave us a statement.

29:21.479 --> 29:24.896
Uh, you spoke to him?
T-Today?

29:24.980 --> 29:27.354
- Yes.
- Uh, OK.
