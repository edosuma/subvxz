WEBVTT

00:06.523 --> 00:08.507
Okay, Gladys sent us
for mosquito repellent,

00:08.542 --> 00:09.958
tick repellent,
and black fly repellent.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.893
I miss New York,

00:11.929 --> 00:15.347
all we needed there
was chatty cabbie repellent.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.625
Well, if you see a handsome
lumberjack, get him!

00:18.660 --> 00:20.980
I'll go look in
the meat section.

00:23.156 --> 00:24.848
Look, there is a
handsome lumberjack.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.617
Oddly enough,
in the produce section.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.157
Hi, I'm Emma. This is Zuri.

00:33.192 --> 00:37.060
And we have a friend named
Lou, who is really cute.

00:37.096 --> 00:38.854
I'm Noah, and I have
a friend named Steve,

00:38.889 --> 00:40.129
who has a nasty overbite.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.809
Have you seen the bevels?

00:43.844 --> 00:45.644
Did they open for
One Direction at Coachella?

00:46.830 --> 00:48.881
No, it's a tool for
making furniture.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.156
It's how I make my living.
Don't care.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.971
Hey, Lou. This is Noah.

00:56.006 --> 00:58.974
He makes furniture,
you make furniture.

00:59.009 --> 01:00.609
We thought you two
might like to talk.

01:01.202 --> 01:02.202
(HONKS)

01:05.824 --> 01:07.891
Uh, that's Lou for, "Hello."

01:10.746 --> 01:12.579
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

01:12.615 --> 01:15.507
<i>¶ We're leaving the city

01:15.542 --> 01:17.434

ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:10.954
So, Lou, what did you think of that
guy Noah we met in town this morning?

02:10.989 --> 02:12.131
He's so sweet,

02:12.166 --> 02:15.792
I want to melt him down
and pour him on my pancakes!

02:15.827 --> 02:18.837
Well, turn on the burner,
because he's on our porch!

02:20.599 --> 02:22.357
(GIBBERS NERVOUSLY)

02:22.392 --> 02:25.719
Oh, no, she's talking like that kid
who got hit by lightning again.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.022
Why is he here?

02:29.058 --> 02:33.593
Because we thought you might
want to talk to him some more.

02:33.628 --> 02:34.748
But in complete sentences.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.906
I don't think I can do that.

02:37.941 --> 02:40.626
I mean, look at him. He's so...

02:40.661 --> 02:43.203
(GRUNTS AND GIGGLES)

02:43.238 --> 02:45.313
You'll be fine.
Just be calm and cool.

02:45.348 --> 02:46.831
Right.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.241
Go. Go.

02:48.277 --> 02:49.397
Go. Move your feet.

02:51.479 --> 02:53.213
Hey, there, Noah.

02:53.248 --> 02:54.814
Good to see you again.

02:54.849 --> 02:56.124
She said calmly and coolly.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.844
Hey, Lou. Good to see you, too.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.388
Good to see you, too.

03:01.423 --> 03:03.439
She already said that.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.555
It's like watching a kitten
wander into traffic.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.163
This is an amazing chair!

03:10.199 --> 03:11.723
Very well crafted.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.868
Whoever made this thing really
speaks the language of wood.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.711
Actually, I made it.

03:16.747 --> 03:18.905
I speak oak, pine,

03:18.940 --> 03:20.506
and a little mahogany.

03:20.542 --> 03:21.849
Really?

03:21.885 --> 03:25.062
You know, I tried to learn
hickory, but it was too hard,

03:25.097 --> 03:27.457
because, you know,
it's a hardwood!

03:28.583 --> 03:29.799
Lou, laugh!

03:29.834 --> 03:31.034
(LAUGHING)

03:32.996 --> 03:34.887
(CLEARS THROAT) So...

03:34.923 --> 03:36.289
Lou, would you like to
go out with me?

03:36.324 --> 03:37.607
Yes!

03:37.643 --> 03:39.342
That means, "Yes!"

03:39.377 --> 03:40.693
Which is what she just said.

03:40.729 --> 03:41.729
I'll go away now.

03:47.744 --> 03:50.595
Hey, guys, check out
this coin I found!

03:50.631 --> 03:53.022
Wow, this looks like real gold!

03:53.057 --> 03:54.532
Where did you find it?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.650
Under the tree by
the soccer field,

03:55.686 --> 03:57.502
where I nap.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.571
But why were you not playing soccer
with the rest of the campers?

03:59.606 --> 04:02.766
By the time I run across
the field, the game is over.

04:02.801 --> 04:05.819
Who needs that?

04:05.854 --> 04:07.754
This thing looks even
older than Gladys.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.949
Check it out, Ravi.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.918
It appears to be an
authentic Viking coin.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.996
Cool! Do you think it will
work in the gum machine?

04:16.031 --> 04:17.697
No.

04:17.732 --> 04:19.783
This could be priceless.

04:19.818 --> 04:23.278
Some historians believe that the first
Europeans to land here in Maine

04:23.313 --> 04:25.088
were Vikings,
led by Leif Eriksson.

04:25.123 --> 04:28.216
Ya know, I think I do remember
hearing a camp legend

04:28.251 --> 04:31.260
that there was treasure
buried somewhere around here.

04:31.296 --> 04:32.412
Treasure? Treasure?

04:32.448 --> 04:33.538
We have to find it!

04:33.573 --> 04:36.458
But first we must do what all
great treasure hunters do.

04:36.493 --> 04:40.237
Buy an awesome leather jacket
and get a grumpy sidekick?

04:40.272 --> 04:44.199
Do not be ridiculous!
I was talking about research.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.234
So I guess all I need now
is the jacket.

04:50.173 --> 04:51.990
<i>Voila!</i> My masterpiece.

04:55.353 --> 04:58.913
Well, don't I look like the
prize-winning pony at the state fair!

05:01.042 --> 05:02.762
I knew I made your chin
look too long!

05:03.812 --> 05:04.552
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

05:04.588 --> 05:06.221
That's Noah!

05:06.256 --> 05:07.380
Okay, Lou, come with me
to the bathroom.

05:07.416 --> 05:08.748
Zuri, you get the door.

05:08.783 --> 05:10.483
Why can't I get the door?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.639
Because a boy should always
wait for his date.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.910
Hello, young man. I'm Miss Ross.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.770
I know, we met at
the store yesterday.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.645
Don't talk back to me, son!
Yes, ma'am.

05:24.975 --> 05:26.966
Is Lou ready?

05:27.001 --> 05:29.160
Let's not worry about
Lou right now.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.354
Let's talk about you.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.064
So, where do you see yourself
in five years?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.958
Five years older?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.017
What's your relationship like
with your mother?

05:36.052 --> 05:38.186
Not great. She's in prison.

05:38.221 --> 05:39.805
Do you have a
retirement account?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.080
I have a piggy bank.

05:41.783 --> 05:43.291
Lou!

05:43.326 --> 05:44.751
Help!

05:45.762 --> 05:46.762
Hey, Noah.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.589
I like your shirt.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.049
Thanks. It's my formal flannel.

05:52.777 --> 05:55.177
And you look beautiful, Lou.

05:55.213 --> 05:56.893
Thank you. Thank you.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.258
Just have her back by curfew,

06:00.294 --> 06:03.269
or the next thing you'll be
carving is your own coffin.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.840
Don't worry, Noah,
she's kidding.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.435
But just in case,
let's walk fast!

06:12.789 --> 06:13.789
(SNORING)

06:19.513 --> 06:21.087
Learn anything yet?

06:21.122 --> 06:24.766
Only that Jorge has
a deviated septum.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.769
Ravi, people have been trying to find
this treasure for hundreds of years.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.765
Maybe this is just too
hard for you.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.024
Too hard?

06:33.059 --> 06:37.287
I will have you know, I once
calculated Pi to one thousand places.

06:37.322 --> 06:39.042
What do you have to
say about that?

06:39.582 --> 06:40.582
Cool?

06:44.254 --> 06:46.972
Guys!
Look at the picture I found!

06:47.007 --> 06:49.740
Is it a girl in a bikini?

06:49.776 --> 06:53.386
No, it is a picture of our camp
founder Jedediah Swearengen

06:53.422 --> 06:54.920
in a coonskin hat.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.706
Then I'm going back to sleep.

06:56.741 --> 06:58.232
No, Jorge, check it out.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.786
He's wearing a chain with the
same Viking coin attached to it!

07:00.821 --> 07:02.595
Which means...

07:02.631 --> 07:03.963
Jedediah must have
had the treasure!

07:03.999 --> 07:08.818
According to the yearbook, the mess
hall used to be Jedediah's cabin.

07:08.853 --> 07:10.937
We should start
our search there.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.533
Right after we buy
our awesome jackets!

07:14.409 --> 07:15.529
I'm not giving up on that.

07:19.481 --> 07:23.416
I can't believe Gladys is making
us pick up her foot fungus cream.

07:23.451 --> 07:26.102
Yeah, we just got her
a bucketful last week.

07:26.138 --> 07:27.458
That woman has some funky feet.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.166
Lou, what are you doing here?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.442
I thought you were supposed to be
on your date at the Crab Shack.

07:33.478 --> 07:34.836
Noah changed our plans.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.139
He thought it would be more romantic
to make furniture together.

07:38.175 --> 07:40.750
Isn't that great?

07:40.786 --> 07:45.055
Yeah, because all those rom-come
where they make furniture together

07:45.090 --> 07:46.331
are really awesome.

07:48.827 --> 07:50.819
Noah's the best.

07:50.854 --> 07:53.263
In fact, right now
he's getting us milkshakes.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.808
Hey, Noah. Lou was just
telling us about your date.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.819
Yeah, I think you forgot
her milkshake.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.721
Uh... No, I didn't.

08:01.756 --> 08:03.664
We're sharing!

08:03.699 --> 08:05.100
We're even sharing a straw!

08:05.135 --> 08:07.126
That's so sweet!

08:07.162 --> 08:08.520
Mmm-hmm.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.259
Emma, do you smell
something fishy?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.486
(SNIFFS)
Yes. It's probably the bait.

08:18.881 --> 08:21.140
No. I'm talking about Noah.

08:21.176 --> 08:22.950
I don't trust him.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.970
I think he's a nice guy,

08:25.005 --> 08:28.389
and you don't trust anyone. I mean, you
had your doubts about Ravi at first.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.665
I'm still not completely
sold on him.

08:36.991 --> 08:37.991
(SIGHS HAPPILY)

08:39.427 --> 08:42.078
Well, it's about time!

08:42.113 --> 08:46.207
You are 37 seconds late.
I was worried sick!

08:46.242 --> 08:47.500
So, Lou, how was
your second date?

08:47.535 --> 08:49.927
Did you go to a nice restaurant
or a movie this time?

08:49.962 --> 08:51.404
Better.

08:51.439 --> 08:53.064
We made a coffee table!

08:54.017 --> 08:56.000
Well, actually,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.996
I made it and then
he put magazines on top of it.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.090
And tomorrow, he's taking me
to the lumberyard!

09:03.126 --> 09:04.792
Ooh, is that a
trendy new restaurant?

09:04.827 --> 09:06.077
No, it's a lumberyard.

09:08.239 --> 09:11.319
His truck is broken, and he needs
someone to carry the wood.

09:11.877 --> 09:13.126
So romantic.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.230
You know what, Zuri?

09:17.265 --> 09:21.192
I'm starting to think Noah may
be using Lou for free labor!

09:21.227 --> 09:22.227
Ya think?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.905
Of course he's using her!

09:25.940 --> 09:27.523
We have to tell Lou!

09:27.559 --> 09:29.675
You're right. We'll set him straight
tomorrow when we go to the store

09:29.711 --> 09:33.354
to pick up Gladys'
extra-strength dandruff shampoo.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.670
That woman needs medical help.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.271
I cannot believe we are on
a real treasure hunt!

09:41.306 --> 09:42.614
And yet, still no jacket.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.559
So, Xander,

09:46.594 --> 09:50.880
have you ever noticed anything
unusual in the mess hall?

09:50.882 --> 09:54.408
Only that the ratatouille is
made from real rats.

09:54.444 --> 09:56.002
Oh, look! This board
has my initial on it,

09:56.037 --> 09:57.337
"X" for Xander.

09:57.372 --> 09:58.855
Or,

09:58.890 --> 10:00.873
"X" marks the spot!

10:00.908 --> 10:04.269
Jorge, come here!

10:04.271 --> 10:06.511
There's way too much running
in treasure hunting.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.491
Well, is there
anything in there?

10:10.526 --> 10:12.060
Patience!

10:12.095 --> 10:13.561
Piece of wood...

10:13.596 --> 10:15.246
Dust bunny...

10:15.282 --> 10:16.522
What I hope is a dust bunny...

10:17.258 --> 10:18.524
Ah-ha!

10:19.861 --> 10:22.111
It is a Viking amulet

10:23.039 --> 10:25.397
and a note!

10:25.433 --> 10:27.950
"If you want to be rich
from Viking loot,"

10:27.985 --> 10:30.562
"climb the structure
where people salute."

10:30.597 --> 10:33.498
"When you reach the top,
you are on your way."

10:33.533 --> 10:36.242
"Hold up this amulet
at last light of day."

10:36.277 --> 10:37.957
What do you guys
think that means?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.321
Ooh,

10:40.356 --> 10:43.191
the place where people
salute is the flagpole!

10:43.226 --> 10:45.001
Brilliant!

10:45.036 --> 10:49.388
So we must place the amulet at the
top of the flagpole at sunset,

10:49.423 --> 10:51.366
and it will reveal where
the treasure is!

10:51.401 --> 10:53.450
We're gonna be rich!

10:53.486 --> 10:55.528
Yes, you can get your jacket.

10:55.564 --> 10:57.055
Forget that.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.115
I'm getting a convertible,

10:59.117 --> 11:01.609
so this gorgeous mane can
flow free in the wind.

11:05.423 --> 11:07.373
Okay, Lumber-jerk,

11:07.408 --> 11:09.183
you're in big trouble!

11:09.219 --> 11:12.259
Emma, I say we stick a squirrel in his
pants, and let nature take its course!

11:14.348 --> 11:16.216
What are you talking about?

11:16.218 --> 11:18.618
We know you've been using
Lou as free labor, you

11:18.886 --> 11:20.695
no-goodnik!

11:20.730 --> 11:21.890
Sorry for the bad language.

11:22.924 --> 11:24.307
Free labor?

11:24.342 --> 11:26.025
No, I really like Lou.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.487
Then why do you have her
building chairs on every date?

11:29.523 --> 11:32.765
Because my gramp-gramp
is really sick,

11:32.800 --> 11:36.544
and Adirondack chairs
are his favorite.

11:36.579 --> 11:38.696
He just wants to
spend his last days

11:38.731 --> 11:39.771
reclining in comfort.

11:41.717 --> 11:44.127
We are so sorry.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.212
Can you forgive us?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.206
Of course.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.201
It is the carpenter's
code to forgive.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.744
Okay, Zuri, let's go.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.019
(PHONE BUZZING)

11:55.707 --> 11:57.932
Oh, we forgot
Gladys' dandruff shampoo.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.677
Great, I'll take 5,000
for the chairs.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.561
You are lucky to be getting
Noah Drake originals.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.490
And I am getting a new truck!

12:05.525 --> 12:06.965
But first,
he's getting a black eye!

12:14.008 --> 12:17.177
All right, I'll make sure
everyone stays in the mess hall,

12:17.212 --> 12:18.177
so when you discover
the treasure,

12:18.212 --> 12:20.471
no one else finds out about it,
and we don't have to split it.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.506
Great.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.726
RAVI: Are you sure I am
not too heavy?

12:27.755 --> 12:29.595
Nope, in fact, you're
lighter than the flag.

12:36.514 --> 12:38.706
(GASPS) Look, it is working!

12:40.985 --> 12:44.253
Wow, treasure and suckers?

12:44.288 --> 12:45.904
Cool!

12:45.940 --> 12:48.199
(LAUGHING)

12:48.235 --> 12:49.934
What is going on?

12:49.970 --> 12:53.404
This was the traditional Grizzly
Cabin fake scavenger hunt.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.156
There's no treasure.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.057
You just got bunk'd!

12:56.092 --> 12:57.258
What?

12:57.293 --> 12:58.351
Ahhh!

12:58.386 --> 13:00.603
Ow!

13:00.638 --> 13:03.664
Now, my pride and my
pelvis are wounded.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.816
(GROANING)

13:07.662 --> 13:08.736
Hey, Lou.

13:11.274 --> 13:12.624
I need to talk to you
about Noah.

13:12.659 --> 13:16.869
Every time I think about him,
I hear birds singing.

13:16.904 --> 13:19.384
Maybe that's because
we live in a forest.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.167
Look...

13:22.202 --> 13:24.710
Noah's just using you to make chairs
to sell so he can buy a new truck.

13:24.746 --> 13:25.986
Don't carve me to death.

13:27.356 --> 13:28.773
What are you talking about?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.992
I am so sorry, Lou.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.360
It just kills me
to tell you this...

13:33.396 --> 13:34.854
But I heard him on the phone.

13:34.889 --> 13:36.898
Well, you heard wrong!

13:36.933 --> 13:39.016
Look, Noah and I
have something special.

13:39.051 --> 13:42.562
Our souls connect like
a dovetail joint.

13:42.597 --> 13:46.157
But don't you see, you're the
one doing all the connecting?

13:46.192 --> 13:49.819
What I see is that I'm
supportive of you and Xander,

13:49.854 --> 13:52.330
but for some reason, you can't
be supportive of me and Noah!

13:52.365 --> 13:55.808
I'm just looking out for you.
You're my best friend.

13:55.843 --> 13:57.723
Yeah, well, best friends
support each other.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.273
So, maybe you're
not my best friend.

14:06.204 --> 14:08.504
So how'd it go with Lou?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.740
I don't know what hurts more,

14:11.776 --> 14:15.096
that Lou said she's not my friend
or that I sat on her chisel.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.771
What are we going to do
about this Noah guy?

14:24.806 --> 14:26.981
I have a plan.

14:27.016 --> 14:29.777
Next time I see him, I'm
gonna US Open his head.

14:30.937 --> 14:33.988
I have two fake passports
and a bag full of rubles.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.884
As much as I'd like to
get rid of him,

14:37.919 --> 14:40.068
and live in Moscow,

14:40.104 --> 14:41.104
maybe we should take
a different approach.

14:41.139 --> 14:44.582
I just want to approach his
lying face with this racquet!

14:44.617 --> 14:46.550
No!

14:46.585 --> 14:50.112
Lou won't listen to me, so we have to
show her what kind of guy Noah really is.

14:50.148 --> 14:51.964
Come on!

14:52.000 --> 14:53.341
Zuri, leave the racquet.

15:02.218 --> 15:04.143
How is it you have one
of these at camp,

15:04.179 --> 15:05.486
but you don't have soap?

15:05.521 --> 15:10.249
Hey, my hair is my life.

15:10.284 --> 15:14.920
Xander, I cannot believe you would try
and fool me with another fake coin!

15:14.956 --> 15:16.480
How stupid do you think I am?

15:16.515 --> 15:19.475
What are you talking about? I
have the fake coin right here.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.388
Well, if that is the fake one,

15:23.423 --> 15:24.922
this one must be...

15:24.957 --> 15:26.641
A real Viking gold coin!

15:26.676 --> 15:30.761
So that means there could be a real
treasure somewhere around camp!

15:30.797 --> 15:32.380
Oh, my gosh!

15:32.415 --> 15:35.048
We need to find it! But we can't
do it without your brains!

15:35.084 --> 15:36.717
Okay, okay... I'll help.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.303
I think he meant me.

15:41.799 --> 15:42.849
Jorge, just do whatever
you did last time.

15:42.884 --> 15:43.975
On it!

15:47.613 --> 15:48.613
(SNORING)

15:51.910 --> 15:53.183
I will stay here and study
these books some more.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.461
Xander, you go to the library
and see if you can find

15:56.497 --> 15:58.105
more about the camp's history.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.425
Right. Uh... One question.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.401
Where's the library?

16:02.437 --> 16:04.077
It is the building behind
the science lab.

16:04.413 --> 16:05.453
Behind the mess hall.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.058
(LAUGHS)

16:09.093 --> 16:10.518
(LAUGHING)

16:10.553 --> 16:14.972
Good job, Ravi! He totally
thought our fake coin was real!

16:15.007 --> 16:16.924
Our plan is in motion.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.595
The bunk'd-ees have
become the bunk'd-ers.

16:23.007 --> 16:25.558
That did not sound quite
as cool as I thought it would.

16:28.162 --> 16:30.196
Hey, Lou.

16:30.231 --> 16:32.573
Well, look who it is.

16:32.608 --> 16:33.899
Emma I can't-support-
my-best-friend-

16:33.934 --> 16:37.745
because-I don't-like-my-
best-friend's-boyfriend Ross.

16:37.780 --> 16:40.260
My middle name is Evangeline.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.650
Listen, we came to apologize.

16:43.686 --> 16:45.446
You were right.
We must have misheard Noah.

16:46.188 --> 16:47.697
Well...

16:47.732 --> 16:49.240
Thank you for saying that.

16:49.275 --> 16:54.095
And to make it up to you, we want
to help you finish the chairs.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.188
We're guessing Noah's not here.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.850
Yeah, he's getting a manicure.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.885
He always wants to look
his best for me.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.297
Anyway, we wanna make
the chairs perfect,

17:05.333 --> 17:08.359
so we called Noah's grandpa
to find out what he likes.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.502
Awww, that's so sweet.

17:10.537 --> 17:13.977
Noah is always talking about how much his
poor, sick gramp-gramp loves these chairs.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.910
Well, we have everything
in these bags

17:17.946 --> 17:20.946
to make him the happiest dying
gramp-gramp in all of Maine!

17:26.512 --> 17:28.237
So after extensive research,

17:28.272 --> 17:32.683
I have discovered that Jedediah's
grandson, Tobias Swearengen,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.110
installed an elaborate
sewage system.

17:35.145 --> 17:37.680
Well, he did a terrible job.

17:37.715 --> 17:39.715
Every time I go it's
a triple-flusher!

17:41.786 --> 17:43.786
I don't think you can
blame him for that.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.115
So, Ravi, what does this have
to do with the treasure?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.190
Take a look at this.

17:51.161 --> 17:52.270
XANDER: That guy looks rich.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.079
RAVI: Exactly.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.041
A little too rich for a mere
summer camp owner.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.237
So Tobias may have been
living off the treasure!

18:00.163 --> 18:01.470
But he probably spent it all.

18:01.506 --> 18:03.547
I don't think so.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.416
He died right after
this was taken.

18:05.451 --> 18:08.485
The lesson being, you should
never pose for a picture

18:08.521 --> 18:10.521
while standing in the
middle of the road.

18:11.524 --> 18:16.794
Anyhoo, when I looked at the schematics,
one sewage pipe is a dead end.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.345
So the treasure may be in there!

18:18.380 --> 18:20.872
Exactly! I will go in.

18:20.908 --> 18:22.858
I just need to overcome
my fear of the dark,

18:22.893 --> 18:24.527
and confined spaces

18:24.562 --> 18:25.686
and pipes

18:25.722 --> 18:26.904
and spiders.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.322
Maybe I should do it.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.357
Good idea.

18:32.436 --> 18:36.605
Wow, these chairs will knock
Noah's gramp-gramp out!

18:36.641 --> 18:37.881
And hopefully Noah, too.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.061
Lou, what did you do?

18:43.097 --> 18:45.540
We made the chairs the way
your gramp-gramp wants them.

18:45.575 --> 18:49.476
How could he want anything?
He died two years ago!

18:49.511 --> 18:51.162
Oh, no! Let me comfort you!

18:52.815 --> 18:54.373
Wait,

18:54.408 --> 18:55.791
two years ago?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.671
Ha! So he's already dead!

19:00.707 --> 19:01.705
I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

19:01.740 --> 19:02.940
But you're a liar!

19:04.885 --> 19:07.753
I am very disappointed
in you, young man!

19:07.789 --> 19:10.229
And to think I let you
date my little girl!

19:12.793 --> 19:14.843
Wait, you mean it's true?

19:14.879 --> 19:17.279
You only went out with me
so you could get a new truck?

19:17.315 --> 19:19.214
No!

19:19.250 --> 19:21.108
It's gently used.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.428
Yeah, well,
you better start running,

19:24.463 --> 19:28.115
or you won't be able to sit
in your "gently used" truck,

19:28.150 --> 19:29.790
because you'll have
a butt full of nails!

19:35.892 --> 19:36.999
Lou, are you okay?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.290
You should've let me
bring my racquet.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.228
(LAUGHING)

19:49.263 --> 19:51.430
Let the payback begin.

19:51.465 --> 19:53.899
Shh.

19:53.934 --> 19:55.426
Grizzly 1 to Grizzly 2.
How is it going?

19:55.461 --> 19:57.544
Ugh...

19:57.580 --> 19:59.163
It reeks in here!

19:59.198 --> 20:00.997
(COUGHING)

20:01.033 --> 20:02.541
I just swallowed something...

20:02.576 --> 20:06.037
And it's not happy.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.239
Okay, you should be getting
close to the treasure.

20:09.683 --> 20:11.100
You better hurry,

20:11.135 --> 20:13.469
because I have to go
to the bathroom real bad!

20:13.504 --> 20:15.521
(LAUGHING)

20:15.556 --> 20:18.849
No, no! Ravi, keep Jorge
away from the toilet!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.443
(LAUGHING)

20:21.478 --> 20:23.345
Guys, I think I found
the treasure!

20:23.380 --> 20:26.040
Huzzah! Do not open it!

20:26.075 --> 20:28.000
Meet us at the Great Lawn

20:28.035 --> 20:29.418
so we can all open it together!

20:29.453 --> 20:30.469
Got ya!

20:31.438 --> 20:33.255
(GAGGING)

20:33.290 --> 20:34.873
Did you just swallow
another bug?

20:34.909 --> 20:36.325
I wish.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.844
(LAUGHING)

20:38.879 --> 20:40.337
Here comes Xander!

20:40.373 --> 20:42.130
I got the treasure!

20:42.165 --> 20:43.732
And very possibly pink eye.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.860
Time to get rich!

20:50.015 --> 20:51.540
Wait,

20:51.576 --> 20:52.825
what's this?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.793
A big sucker.

20:54.828 --> 20:57.613
Because you're a sucker!

20:57.648 --> 20:59.206
Now you have been bunk'd!

21:00.268 --> 21:02.826
Okay, you got me.

21:02.862 --> 21:06.646
So, the bunk'd-ees have
become the bunk'd-ers.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.402
Why does it sound cool
when he says it?

21:10.886 --> 21:12.185
I'll take another one,

21:12.221 --> 21:13.896
but no straw.

21:13.931 --> 21:15.180
It reminds me of him.

21:16.617 --> 21:17.617
Hey, Lou.

21:18.302 --> 21:20.569
Hey.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.554
I'm so sorry things turned
out the way they did.

21:22.589 --> 21:25.090
Me, too.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.658
I hope you're not mad at us.

21:26.694 --> 21:28.118
I'm not mad,

21:28.154 --> 21:29.828
I'm just...

21:29.864 --> 21:31.814
Embarrassed.

21:31.849 --> 21:33.640
How could I be so stupid?

21:33.676 --> 21:35.509
You're not stupid.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.769
Noah's the stupid one
for not appreciating you.

21:37.805 --> 21:40.547
You know, I should've known something
was up when I went in for a kiss,

21:40.582 --> 21:43.534
and he handed me a belt sander.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.653
I'd like to teach him a lesson.

21:45.688 --> 21:47.528
You know, we have
a very deep lake out there.

21:49.834 --> 21:50.834
Thanks, Zuri.

21:52.995 --> 21:54.545
Are you going to be okay?

21:54.580 --> 21:55.580
I guess.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.565
It just...

21:58.592 --> 22:01.176
Really hurts.

22:01.212 --> 22:03.612
Hey, they don't call it
a crush for nothing.

22:05.450 --> 22:09.226
But I know one day,
you will find the perfect guy.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.753
And I know you guys will
be happy together,

22:11.788 --> 22:15.457
as long as he can prove to me
he has a retirement account,

22:15.492 --> 22:16.950
and does not sass back.

22:18.779 --> 22:19.953
Thanks, guys.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.459
All I know is,

22:25.494 --> 22:28.774
you won't see me falling for
some guy any time soon.

22:34.011 --> 22:35.171
Yeah, right.

22:37.139 --> 22:39.256
Okay, I took 50 showers,

22:39.292 --> 22:43.143
and I still can't get this
smelly sludge out of my hair.

22:43.179 --> 22:45.012
That might be because the water

22:45.047 --> 22:46.397
comes from the same pipes.

22:48.217 --> 22:50.192
This prank gets
better and better.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.453
Hey, joke's on you.

22:53.488 --> 22:54.571
I used your hair dryer.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.909
I must say,

22:58.944 --> 23:03.096
it was exciting to think that
there was a real treasure here.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.332
Too bad that it was not true.
