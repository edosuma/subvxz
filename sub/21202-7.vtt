07:52.973 --> 07:55.075
and drive out here. ...look
forward to seeing you --

07:55.109 --> 07:58.379
So we need to figure out
what else she knows.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.414
(scoffs)

08:00.448 --> 08:02.783
She's a grad student.
What can she do?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.618
TEDDY: Exactly what
she's been doing.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.654
She can ask around,
she can make some noise.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.256
She can go to the police.

08:08.289 --> 08:09.990
So I, for one, will sleep
much better knowing

08:10.023 --> 08:12.293

any traction.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.328

you will, too.

Okay, what's that?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.343

You didn't just dump 'em
in the canyon, did you?

08:32.280 --> 08:35.349
No, I took them all
out of town, buried them.

08:35.383 --> 08:37.251
TEDDY: Where?

08:37.285 --> 08:39.987

Uh, I'm not sure exactly.

exactly

08:41.855 --> 08:43.624

three dead girls?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.360
It was somewhere off Highway 14
in the Antelope Valley.

08:49.197 --> 08:50.798
I could take you out there
if you want to.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.466
God, no. I don't --
that's --

they're not gonna be a problem.

out as far as I could

a question?

If, by some chance, this --
the sister does have traction...

09:09.317 --> 09:11.719

09:11.752 --> 09:14.288
she's found something that
would jeopardize the op?

09:14.322 --> 09:15.923
Yeah.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.884
(truck doors open, close)

36:57.917 --> 36:59.551
(engine starts)

37:01.320 --> 37:03.355
Ay!

37:03.389 --> 37:06.492
Someday soon it's gonna be
foot soldiers doing all the runs

37:06.525 --> 37:08.294
instead of rancheros.

37:08.327 --> 37:11.497
Even though seem to think
nothing's changing.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.233
Too much up for grabs.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.468
These bastards are changing
the tempo of the whole thing

37:16.502 --> 37:18.570
and from prison.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.507
Shit. They're gonna redraw
the whole map.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.842
That's what
they're gonna do.

37:23.876 --> 37:27.713
Being boss?
Always looking ahead.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.850
(speaking Spanish)

37:31.884 --> 37:34.520
Yeah? What can you see?

37:44.263 --> 37:45.764
What's up with you?

37:48.734 --> 37:50.036
Nothing.

37:51.637 --> 37:56.042
Listen, the other night
at the party, um,

37:56.075 --> 37:59.311
that's a nice thing
you said.

38:00.947 --> 38:02.881
Sorry I got on your case,
you know.

38:02.915 --> 38:05.551
I was, um...you know.

38:10.156 --> 38:11.590
Papa?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.262
I've gotta tell you something.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.471
(click, creaking)

38:27.606 --> 38:30.609
(snoring)

38:34.813 --> 38:36.282
(snorts)

38:36.315 --> 38:39.251
-What time is it?
-(laughs) What's up, man?

38:39.285 --> 38:41.420
Saint.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.290
Little Joe ever show up?

38:44.323 --> 38:46.725
Did he ever.
Fuck is wrong with you?

38:46.758 --> 38:49.795
Devon was mad as hell, man.
You almost got me killed.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.630
Shit would've been better,
though.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.999
I'm never drinking again.

38:53.032 --> 38:54.800
My bad, man. Sorry I left.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.603
Just had to leave, man.
Get my mind right.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.639
-All night?
-Got caught up.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.774
(scoffs)

39:02.808 --> 39:04.676
Come on, man. Open the door.
Shit.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.513
-Shotgun.
-Man, shotgun.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.316
Hey, we hit 7-Eleven before
we hit the highway?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.851
Oh, yeah. Sure, baby.
You know.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.853
(unzips bag) Soon as Franklin
tell us why he blew the deal

39:14.886 --> 39:17.289
we drove all the way
the fuck out here for.

39:17.323 --> 39:20.192
And why he got me kicked out
my own cousin's spot.

39:20.226 --> 39:21.660
And where the hell he been
all night.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.196
Then we can go to 7-Eleven,
Leon.

39:26.165 --> 39:27.833
(bag rustling)

39:29.368 --> 39:31.803
-What the hell?
-The fuck is that?

39:32.804 --> 39:35.174
Our future.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.143
(scoffs) Man...

39:37.176 --> 39:38.777
Nigga, you crazy, man.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.479
-"Our future."
-LEON: Fool trippin'.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.880
(engine starts)
KEVIN: Fuck you talking about?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.549
LEON: (speaks indistinctly)

39:43.582 --> 39:45.984
KEVIN: I don't wanna hear
all that. We going home.

39:46.018 --> 39:48.387
(zips bag)

39:48.420 --> 39:51.157
-"The future."
-What future?
