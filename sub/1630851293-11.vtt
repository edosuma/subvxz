04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
ARIZONA'S SECRETARY OF STATE HAS

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
EXPRESSED ALARM OVER ACCOUNTS OF

04:19.000 --> 04:19.000
BALLOTS BEING LEFT UNATTENDED,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
AND UNTRAINED WORKERS USING

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
40,000 BALLOTS WERE FLOWN IN.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
>> TO ARIZONA?

04:59.000 --> 04:59.000
>> TO ARIZONA.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
AND IT WAS STUFFED INTO THE BOX,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
OKAY?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
AND IT CAME FROM THE SOUTHEAST

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
PART OF THE WORLD, ASIA, OKAY?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
BAMBOO?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
>> BECAUSE THEY USE BAMBOO IN

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000

SIXTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
AND LOOK, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
NONSENSE.

05:35.000 --> 05:35.000

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
MULTIPLE AUDITS CONDUCTED IN

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
HERITAGE.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
BUT I GUARANTEE SOME OF YOU WERE

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
JUST TRANSPORTED BACK TO BEING

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
8-YEARS-OLD SITTING ON A HIGH

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
STOOL IN THE KITCHEN AT 6:00 AM

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
ON SCHOOL PICTURE DAY, HOLDING

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
YOUR EARS DOWN WHILE YOUR MOM OR

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
GRANDMA GETS THE HOT COMB

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO YOUR

13:02.000 --> 13:02.000
SCALP.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
FOR SOME, THE SMELL OF BURNING

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
HAIR IS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING'S

13:04.000 --> 13:04.000
WRONG.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
BUT FOR OTHERS, IT BRINGS BACK

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
MEMORIES.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
BY THE 1960s AND '70s, THOUGH,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
THE EMBRACE OF BLACK HAIR'S

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
NATURAL TEXTURE AND CULTURALLY

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
SIGNIFICANT STYLES HAD BECOME

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
A RADICAL ACT OF SELF ACCEPTANCE

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
AND POLITICAL POWER.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
>> WHO TAUGHT YOU TO HATE

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
THE TEXTURE OF YOUR HAIR?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO HATE THE COLOR

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
OF YOUR SKIN?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
TO SUCH EXTENT THAT YOU BLEACH,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
TO GET LIKE THE WHITE MAN?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
>> John: UH, WHITE PEOPLE.

13:31.000 --> 13:31.000
THE ANSWER IS WHITE PEOPLE.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
THAT QUESTION ANSWERS ITSELF.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
JUST LIKE THE ANSWER TO THE

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
QUESTIONS: WHO LETS THEIR DOGS

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
KISS THEM IN THE MOUTH?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
WHO WANTS TO PICK APPLES

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
FOR FUN?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
AND WHO'S COMING TO DINNER ON

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
INA GARTEN'S SHOW?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
THE ANSWER IS, WHITE PEOPLE.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
BUT DESPITE THE NATURAL HAIR

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
MOVEMENT, WHITE PEOPLE'S

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
DISCOMFORT AND IGNORANCE AROUND

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
BLACK HAIR HAS VERY MUCH

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
REMAINED.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
ONE STUDY FOUND BLACK WOMEN WERE

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
80% MORE LIKELY TO AGREE WITH

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
THE STATEMENT, "I HAVE TO CHANGE

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
MY HAIR FROM ITS NATURAL STATE

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
TO FIT IN AT THE OFFICE," AND

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
ANOTHER FOUND THAT BLACK WOMEN

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
WITH NATURAL HAIRSTYLES WERE

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
PERCEIVED TO BE LESS

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
PROFESSIONAL, LESS COMPETENT,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
AND LESS LIKELY TO BE

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
RECOMMENDED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
THE POINT IS, THE WAY YOUR HAIR

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
IS PERCEIVED -- AND THEREFORE,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
THE WAY YOU ARE PERCEIVED -- CAN

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
MANIFEST IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
>> I KNOW THE ANXIETY THAT

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
PEOPLE HAVE AFTER GETTING THEIR

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
HAIR DONE THEN, LIKE, "OKAY,

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN I GO

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
TO WORK?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
ARE THEY GONNA SAY ANYTHING?"

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG THING

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
IN THE WORKPLACE.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
DRAW ATTENTION TO THEIR SELF

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
SO THEY TRY TO DO THE NORM.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
>> A LOT OF THE TIME, I WOULD

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
ALWAYS GET PEOPLE JUST, LIKE,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
SAYING HOW, LIKE, SOFT MY HAIR

14:31.000 --> 14:31.000
IS AND EVERYTHING AND LIKE

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
WANTING TO TOUCH IT.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
THAT'S, LIKE, ALWAYS A BIG

14:33.000 --> 14:33.000
THING.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
>> NO, YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT.

14:34.000 --> 14:34.000
>> AND, LIKE, ADULTS DOING THAT

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
TOO, I'M LIKE --

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
>> IT'S GROWN WOMEN.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
>> YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
>> YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T TOUCH

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
NO BLACK WOMEN'S HAIR, YOU

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
ALREADY KNOW THAT, LIKE --

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
>> IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
IN A ZOO.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
>> John: LOOK, YOU OBVIOUSLY

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
SHOULDN'T BE MADE TO FEEL LIKE

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
YOU'RE IN A ZOO, EVER, FOR ANY

14:49.000 --> 14:49.000
REASON.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
ALSO -- AND IT'S NOT THE POINT

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
-- BUT IF YOU'RE TOUCHING

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
ANIMALS AT THE ZOO, YOU'RE DOING

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
THE ZOO WRONG.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
DON'T BE STRESSING THE OTTERS

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
OUT BY SHOUTING UNWANTED

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO SNEAK

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
YOUR HANDS INTO THE CAGES TO

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
COP A FEEL.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
YES, THE BALD EAGLE'S FEATHERS

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
ARE LAID, BUT DON'T SHOUT

15:02.000 --> 15:02.000
"YAAAS, QWEEN" AND TRY TO PET

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
HER.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
UNLIKE YOUR COWORKERS,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
THE EAGLE WILL SNAP YOUR

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
FUCKING FINGERS OFF.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
AND YOU WILL HAVE IT COMING.

15:10.000 --> 15:10.000
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
WHITE PEOPLE'S BIASES AND

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
IGNORANCE ARE OFTEN JUST LAYING

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
IN WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
TO STRIKE.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
>> JONATHON SUTHERLAND IS THE

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
PENN STATE FOOTBALL CAPTAIN AND

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
A DEAN'S LIST STUDENT.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
BUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
ABOUT TONIGHT IS HIS HAIR.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
THAT'S THANKS TO THIS LETTER.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
THE AUTHOR IS A PROCLAIMED

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
ALUMNUS FROM DECADES AGO NAMED

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
DAVID PETERSEN.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
HE CALLS SUTHERLAND'S HAIR

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
"AWFUL."

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
STATING HIS LOCS ARE

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
"DISGUSTING AND ARE CERTAINLY

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
NOT ATTRACTIVE."

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
HE ALSO WRITES,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
"WE WOULD WELCOME THE

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
REAPPEARANCE OF DRESS CODES

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
FOR ATHLETES."

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
>> John: EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT'S

15:47.000 --> 15:47.000
UPSETTING.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
FROM THE RACIST ATTITUDE,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
TO THE HURTFUL LANGUAGE,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
TO THE FACT THAT HE CHOSE

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
TO EXPRESS MORAL OUTRAGE OVER

15:51.000 --> 15:51.000
SOMETHING IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
BUT IT'S NOT THAT THE NCAA MAKES

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
MILLIONS OFF STUDENT ATHLETES,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
INSTEAD, IT'S "I CAN SEE YOUR

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
HAIR OUTSIDE YOUR HELMET."

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
THAT MAN LATER EXPLAINED HE ONLY

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
WROTE THE LETTER BECAUSE

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
"I WAS JUST DISGRUNTLED ABOUT

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
SOME OF THE HAIRDOS THAT WE'RE

16:03.000 --> 16:03.000
SEEING.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
YOU THINK OF PENN STATE AS A

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
BUNCH OF CLEAN-CUT GUYS."

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
AND "YOU THINK OF PENN STATE

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
AS" IS JUST NOT A SENTENCE THAT

16:10.000 --> 16:10.000
ENDS WELL UNDER

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REALIZE,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
THAT MAN ACTUALLY GOT A DEGREE

16:18.000 --> 16:18.000
FROM PENN STATE IN 1966, THE

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
SAME YEAR AS JERRY SANDUSKY.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
WHO SOMEHOW -- DESPITE HIS

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
SHORT HAIR -- TURNED OUT TO BE

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
A HEINOUS SEX CRIMINAL.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE HAIRCUT

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
AND IT STARTS WAY BEFORE

16:32.000 --> 16:32.000
COLLEGE.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
YOU MAY REMEMBER THE TERRIBLE

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
CASE OF HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
ANDREW JOHNSON, WHO WAS

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
BASICALLY FORCED TO CUT HIS LOCS

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
OFF OR FORFEIT AN IMPORTANT

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
WRESTLING MATCH BY A REFEREE.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
THAT CASE MADE NATIONAL NEWS,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
THAT DON'T.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
FROM THE SCHOOL IN KENTUCKY THAT

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
ONCE BANNED -- AND I QUOTE --

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
"DREADLOCKS AND CORN ROLLS,"

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
TO TWIN SISTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
THAT RECEIVED HOURS OF DETENTION

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
BECAUSE OF THEIR BRAIDED HAIR,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
TO THIS DAYCARE IN SUBURBAN

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
CHICAGO.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
>> MOM MAY LIKE THE SMELL,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS NOTE

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
TIONNA NORRIS POSTED ON HER

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
FACEBOOK PAGE,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
AMIA'S TEACHER DIDN'T LIKE IT,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
BASICALLY SAYING...

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
>> YOUR CHILD STINKS.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
DON'T PUT THE COCONUT OIL

17:06.000 --> 17:06.000
IN HER HAIR.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
THE KIDS WERE TEASING HER.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
>> NORRIS SAYS AMIA WAS THE ONLY

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
BLACK CHILD IN HER PRESCHOOL

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
CLASS AT THE RAGGEDY ANNE

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
LEARNING CENTER IN ELMHURST.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
>> I WAS JUST HURT FOR MY CHILD.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
>> ESPECIALLY AFTER NORRIS SAYS

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
SHE MET WITH THE TEACHER AND

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND LEARNED

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
THE CHILDREN IN THE CLASS NEVER

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
COMPLAINED.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
IT WAS JUST THE TEACHER WHO

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
DIDN'T LIKE THE SMELL.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL AND LEFT

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
SEVERAL MESSAGES.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
WE VISITED AND GOT THIS.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
>> HI, I'M DOROTHY TUCKER FROM

17:32.000 --> 17:32.000
CHANNEL 2 NEWS.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
>> GOODBYE.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
>> John: WOW.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
THAT FEELS LIKE A PERFECTLY

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
STAGED FIVE-SECOND PLAY

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
ENCAPSULATING THE HISTORY OF

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA:

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
A BLACK PERSON TRYING TO DISCUSS

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
RACIAL INEQUALITY WITH A WHITE

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
PERSON, WHO THEN IMMEDIATELY

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
SAYS, "GOODBYE!"

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
SO BLACK PEOPLE, FROM AN EARLY

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
AGE, ARE OFTEN TOLD THEIR HAIR

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
IS UNATTRACTIVE.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
AND THAT IS ALREADY JUST...

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
A LOT, BEFORE YOU EVEN START

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
GETTING INTO ALL THE WAYS THAT

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
SOCIETY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
NAVIGATE THE WORLD BECAUSE OF

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
YOUR HAIR.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
EVEN JUST BUYING HAIR PRODUCTS

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
CAN BE AN UNNECESSARY CHALLENGE,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
WITH BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
ROUTINELY LOCKED IN A CASE WHERE

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
SOMEONE HAS TO COME WITH A KEY

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
TO GET IT FOR YOU -- OR MAYBE

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
EVEN "WALK IT TO THE REGISTER"

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
-- IN THE SAME AISLE WHERE

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
PRODUCTS FOR WHITE PEOPLE THAT

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
COST JUST AS MUCH OR MORE ARE

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
SIMPLY SITTING OUT ON THE

18:21.000 --> 18:21.000
SHELVES.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
AND THE EXPLANATION FOR THAT IS

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
NEVER GREAT.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
>> SO I WENT AND FOUND THE

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
MANAGER AND I SAID, "I'M WAITING

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
FOR THE KEY FOR SHAMPOO AND

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
CONDITIONER."

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I SAID, "BUT LET ME ASK YOU,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
WHY ARE THE BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
LOCKED UP AND NOT THE WHITE HAIR

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
PRODUCTS?"

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
HE SAID, "UMM," AND ANOTHER

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
ASSOCIATE SAID, "WELL, PEOPLE

18:41.000 --> 18:41.000
HAVE BEEN STEALING."

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
>> John: YEAH.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
NOW THAT WALMART CLAIMED IT WAS

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
BASED ON DATA OF THEFT

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
IN THE STORE.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
BUT WHEN A TOWN COUNCIL MEMBER

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
ASKED TO SEE THAT DATA, THE

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
STORE INSTRUCTED HER TO CALL

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
"1-800-WALMART."

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
AND JUST OUT OF INTEREST,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
ON A TOUCHTONE PHONE, WHICH

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
BUTTON DO YOU PRESS TO HEAR THE

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
BULLSHIT DATA USED TO JUSTIFY

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
LOCKING UP $4 ECO STYLER GEL?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
IS THAT, LIKE, NUMBER 7 OR DO

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR AN ASSOCIATE

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
FIRST?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
SO IT'S ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
GET PRODUCTS TO DO YOUR HAIR AT

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
HOME.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
BUT FINDING A QUALIFIED STYLIST

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
CAN BE EVEN HARDER.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
THE COSMETOLOGY INDUSTRY MOSTLY

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
REVOLVES AROUND, AND TRAINS FOR,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
CARING FOR STRAIGHT,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
NON-TEXTURED HAIR.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
SO THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
A STYLIST IN YOUR AREA CAN WORK

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
WITH BLACK HAIR -- JUST WATCH

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
ONE TIKTOKER CALL 23 SALONS IN

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
THEIR HOMETOWN, AND GET NOTHING

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
BUT RESPONSES LIKE THESE.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
>> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
WORK WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
SPECIFICALLY 4C TYPE?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
>> UH, WE DO NOT.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
NONE OF THE GIRLS HERE DO, NO.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
>> UM, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
SO I WOULD SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
BETTER TO KEEP LOOKING AROUND.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
>> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR,

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
SPECIFICALLY 4C TYPE?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
>> OH!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE!

19:56.000 --> 19:56.000
LET ME ASK!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
IS ANYBODY FAMILIAR WITH

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
>> NOT VERY MUCH.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
BUT I DO LOVE THAT RECEPTIONIST

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
IS ASKING THE ENTIRE STAFF,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
LIKE SHE JUST GOT CALLED AS A

20:09.000 --> 20:09.000
PHONE-A-FRIEND ON

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE."

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
"HEY, DONNA, IT'S THE $25,000

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
QUESTION.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
CAN YOU DO A SILK PRESS AND BUMP

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
THOSE ENDS?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
FINAL ANSWER: SHE CAN'T."

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
IN SALONS -- EVEN IN HOLLYWOOD,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
STYLISTS WHO ARE BOTH FAMILIAR

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
WITH BLACK HAIR AND IN THE

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
HAIRSTYLISTS' UNION ARE RARE.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
AND ACTORS DEFINITELY KNOW WHEN

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
THEIR PRODUCTION FAILED TO HIRE

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
ONE.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
>> I WAS ON THIS SHOW.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
THEY MADE ME A SERIES REGULAR.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I WAS HELLA PUMPED, WALKED IN

20:36.000 --> 20:36.000
THE HAIR AND MAKEUP TRAILER

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
FIRST TIME.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
"OH, SHIT.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I'M ABOUT TO, LIKE, GET PAID.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
LET ME SEE."

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
HOMEGIRL, THIS WHITE LADY,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
SHE TAPPED MY HEAD.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
>> YUP!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
>> NOT LYING, SHE TAPPED IT,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
SPRAYED SOME WATER -- DIDN'T

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
BRUSH, DIDN'T COMB, AND LEFT.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, WILD!"

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
>> John: I ACTUALLY RECOMMEND

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
GOING BACK AND WATCHING EACH

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
ACTOR IN THAT CLIP AS HE TELLS

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
THAT STORY,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
BECAUSE YOU REALLY GET THE SENSE

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
THAT

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
EVERY ONE OF THEM IDENTIFIES

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
WITH WHAT HE'S SAYING.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
AND IT'S NOT IDEAL THAT FOR

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
A LOT OF HAIRSTYLISTS, THEIR

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH BLACK

21:10.000 --> 21:10.000
CLIENTS IS THE SAME YOU'D USE

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
TO GET YOUR CAT OFF THE KITCHEN

21:11.000 --> 21:11.000
COUNTER.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
GIVE THEM A LITTLE SPRITZ AND

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
THEN GIVE THEM A PAT ON THE HEAD

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
SO THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT MAD.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL OF

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
THE OBSTACLES THAT GET PLACED IN

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
THE PATH OF BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
UNDERSTANDABLY PRETTY HARD TO

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
TAKE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE WEAR THE

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
SAME EXACT SAME HAIRSTYLES THAT

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
THEY GET JUDGEMENT FOR.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
FROM BO DEREK, FAMOUSLY WEARING

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
BRAIDS IN THE MOVIE "10" TO

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
ADELE AND MILEY CYRUS TRYING ON

21:31.000 --> 21:31.000
BLACK HAIRSTYLES FOR FUN, TO

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
THIS COMME DES GARCONS FASHION

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
SHOW, AT WHICH THE MODELS WORE

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
LACE FRONT CORNROW WIGS,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
WHICH WERE AWFUL IN EVERY

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
POSSIBLE WAY.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT THING!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
THERE IS ENOUGH ROOM BETWEEN

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
EACH BRAID TO LAND A FUCKING

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
PLANE, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

21:45.000 --> 21:45.000
TO LOOK CLOSELY TO SEE THE

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
MODEL'S DARK HAIR THROUGH THE

21:46.000 --> 21:46.000
LACE.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
COME ON!

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
YOU PUT A WIG CAP ON FIRST,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
THEN YOU PUT THE WIG ON!

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
YOU GRAB YOUR GOT2B SPRAY

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
OR WIG GLUE, YOU MELT THAT LACE,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
AND YOU LAY THOSE EDGES DOWN

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
SO WELL THEY FALL ASLEEP.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
THERE ARE ONLY TWO SITUATIONS

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
WHERE THAT APPALLING LEVEL OF

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
WIG APPLICATION IS ACCEPTABLE:

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
EITHER YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
HOSTING AN EPISODE OF "SNL," OR

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
YOU'RE POSING AS A BRITISH NANNY

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
TO STAY CLOSE TO YOUR CHILDREN

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
AFTER YOUR DIVORCE.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
THAT IS IT.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
AND THE THING IS, WHITE PEOPLE

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
APPROPRIATING BLACK HAIRSTYLES

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
ISN'T JUST INFURIATING -- IT CAN

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
DIRECTLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
BLACK PEOPLE TO FIGHT

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
DISCRIMINATION CONCERNING THEIR

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
HAIR.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
>> THERE WAS A COURT CASE, 1981,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
A DISCRIMINATION SUIT FILED BY A

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
BLACK WOMAN NAMED RENEE ROGERS.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
SHE'D WORKED FOR AMERICAN

22:27.000 --> 22:27.000
AIRLINES AND SHE WORE HER HAIR

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
IN CORNROWS.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
HER LEGAL ARGUMENT WAS THAT HER

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
HAIRSTYLE WAS A PART OF HER

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
CULTURAL HERITAGE.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST HER IN

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
FEDERAL COURT BECAUSE HE SAID

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
SHE GOT HER HAIR DONE SOON AFTER

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
THE MOVIE "TEN" CAME OUT.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
AND THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
LEGAL BASIS FOR SAYING IT WAS

22:45.000 --> 22:45.000
CULTURAL HERITAGE BECAUSE

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
SHE WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
ESSENTIALLY WAS IMITATING HOW

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
BO DEREK STYLED HER HAIR.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.000
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
AMONG THE REASONS HE DISMISSED

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
HER CASE, THE JUDGE SUGGESTED

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
THAT A BLACK PERSON WEARING A

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
TRADITIONALLY BLACK HAIRSTYLE

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
WAS JUST COPYING A WHITE

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
CELEBRITY, WHO STOLE IT FROM

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
BLACK PEOPLE.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
HAIRSTYLES HAVE CULTURAL ROOTS.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
THEY DON'T JUST COME OUT OF

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
NOWHERE TO SWEEP THE NATION,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
"THE RACHEL," WHICH WASN'T

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
APPROPRIATED FROM ANY CULTURE.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
IT SIMPLY SPRANG FORTH,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
FULLY-FORMED, FROM THE CONCEPT

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
KNOWN AS "THE '90s."

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
AND I WISH I COULD SAY THAT'S

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
A THING OF THE PAST, BUT YOU

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
KNOW IT ISN'T.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
CHASTITY JONES, THE WOMAN YOU

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
SAW EARLIER, SPENT YEARS

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
APPEALING HER CASE, ONLY TO

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
LOSE, IN PART, BECAUSE JUDGES

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
INTERPRETED CIVIL RIGHTS LAW

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
TO PROTECT AGAINST

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
DISCRIMINATION BASED ONLY ON

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
"IMMUTABLE" OR UNCHANGEABLE

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
WITH RACE, LIKE SKIN COLOR.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
SO FOR DECADES, COURTS HAVE

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
FOUND THAT HAIRSTYLES, EVEN

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
THOUGH THEY ARE DEEPLY TIED TO

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
RACIAL IDENTITY, ARE NOT

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
COVERED.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
AND ALL OF THAT MEANS THAT A

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
YOUNGER GENERATION CAN STILL END

23:46.000 --> 23:46.000
UP HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
SHIT.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
>> 19-YEAR-OLD DESTINY THOMPKINS

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
HAS WORKED AT THIS

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
BANANA REPUBLIC STORE AT THE

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
WESTCHESTER MALL IN WHITE PLAINS

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
FOR JUST ABOUT A MONTH.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
SHE WAS CALLED INTO A MEETING

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
WITH HER MANAGER ON WEDNESDAY,

23:58.000 --> 23:58.000
CAUGHT COMPLETELY OFF GUARD BY

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
>> HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, SO, THE

24:02.000 --> 24:02.000
DISTRICT MANAGER CAME IN AND SHE

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
POINTED OUT YOUR HAIR."

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY, SO WHAT'S

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
WRONG WITH MY HAIR?"

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
HE SAID, "IT'S A LITTLE TOO

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
URBAN AND UNKEMPT FOR OUR LOOK

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
AND FOR OUR IMAGE.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
WE WERE JUST WONDERING, LIKE, IF

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
YOU COULD JUST TAKE THEM OUT."

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
>> John: OKAY, PUTTING ASIDE THE

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
USE OF THE WORD "URBAN" -- A

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
LEVEL OF TONE-DEAFNESS ON PAR

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
WITH NAMING YOUR STORE "BANANA

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
REPUBLIC" -- "JUST TAKE THEM

24:28.000 --> 24:28.000
OUT?"

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
THOSE ARE WORDS FROM SOMEONE WHO

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
HAS ZERO IDEA OF WHAT IT TOOK TO

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
PUT THEM IN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
THAT'S COMING FROM A MAN WHO,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I'M GUESSING, HAS NEVER SPENT

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
SEVEN HOURS IN A SALON CHAIR

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
WITH AN iPAD FULL OF MOVIES AND

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
A BACKPACK FULL OF SNACKS.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, THE STORE

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
CALLED THAT UNACCEPTABLE, AND

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
THE MANAGER WAS FIRED.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, SINCE

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
PROFESSIONALISM GETS DEFINED BY

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
WHITE STANDARDS AND

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
EXPECTATIONS, BLACK HAIR

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
IS MORE LIKELY TO CRASH INTO

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
THOSE EXPECTATIONS.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
WELL, FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
ISSUES YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
SOME CHAIN STORES, INCLUDING

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
WALMART, HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY'LL

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
NO LONGER BE LOCKING UP

25:02.000 --> 25:02.000
BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
WHICH FEELS LIKE THE LEAST THEY

25:07.000 --> 25:07.000
CAN DO, BUT IT IS A START!

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
A BIGGER CHANGE WOULD BE TO

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
PASS LAWS LIKE CROWN ACTS, OR

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
"CREATING A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR."

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
VERSIONS HAVE ALREADY BECOME LAW

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
IN THESE 11 STATES.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
AND WHILE THE LANGUAGE VARIES,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
GENERALLY, THEY EXPAND

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
THE DEFINITION OF RACE IN

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS TO

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
INCLUDE TRAITS HISTORICALLY

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
ASSOCIATED WITH RACE, LIKE

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
PROTECTIVE HAIRSTYLES, SUCH AS

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
BRAIDS, LOCS, AND TWISTS.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
UNFORTUNATELY, CROWN ACT BILLS

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
HAVE REPEATEDLY MET WITH

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
IN UTAH, IN ONE RECENT ZOOM

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
HEARING ON THEIR BILL, STATE

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
SENATOR DERRIN OWENS -- WHO

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
VOTED AGAINST IT -- MADE A POINT

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
OF FIRST ADDRESSING THE BILL'S

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
ADVOCATES LIKE THIS.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
>> LET ME MAKE A COMMENT,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
YOU PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS, BUT

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I'M GOING TO SHARE.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I WAS IN THE STORE

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
THE OTHER DAY.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
AND, UH, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
TO SEE THIS PICTURE, BUT THIS

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
GENTLEMAN IN FRONT OF ME -- A

25:59.000 --> 25:59.000
BLACK MAN -- HAD TWO YOUNG

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
CHILDREN AND THEY WERE JUST

26:04.000 --> 26:04.000
HAVING FUN AROUND, UP AND DOWN

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
THE AISLE.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
AND I DON'T NORMALLY TAKE

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
PICTURES OF CHILDREN,

26:07.000 --> 26:07.000
BUT THEY WERE ADORABLE,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
TWO BLACK CHILDREN.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST THE

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
CUTEST KIDS IN THE WORLD.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
ONE HAS CORNROWS AND ONE OF THEM

26:14.000 --> 26:14.000
DREADLOCKS.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
I WISH YOU COULD SEE THAT.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

26:19.000 --> 26:19.000
YOU EXCEPTIONALLY WEIRD MAN?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
JUST TO RECAP: HE STARTED OFF

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
THERE BY TELLING A GROUP OF

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
BLACK WOMEN, "YOU PEOPLE ARE

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
BEAUTIFUL," THEN PROCEEDED TO

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
SAY, "I DON'T NORMALLY TAKE

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
PICTURES OF CHILDREN, BUT" --

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE SENTENCE

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
UNTIL THE "BUT" PART.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
THEN LAUNCHED INTO A STORY ABOUT

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
HOW HE KEEPS PHOTOS OF

26:34.000 --> 26:34.000
STRANGERS' CHILDREN

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
ON HIS PHONE.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
ALL OF WHICH EVOKES A RESPONSE

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
PERHAPS BEST SUMMED UP BY THIS

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
EXPRESSION, WHICH I'D ARGUE IS

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
AN ABSOLUTE MASTERCLASS IN HOW

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
TO SAY "THE FUCK?"

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
USING ONLY YOUR EYEBROWS.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW HE

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
GOT FROM THAT TO VOTING AGAINST

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
THE BILL, HIS ARGUMENT WAS THAT

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
HE FELT EXISTING LAWS WERE

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
SUFFICIENT, AND THAT "IT ALMOST

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO DO

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST."

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
BUT THIS DISCRIMINATION ISN'T

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
"SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST,"

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
IT'S "SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
EXIST FOR WHITE MEN WHO'VE NEVER

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE."

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAIR-BASED

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
DISCRIMINATION ARE VERY REAL.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
JUST LISTEN TO CONNECTICUT STATE

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
SENATOR GARY WINFIELD MAKE THE

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
CASE FOR HIS STATE'S CROWN ACT,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
IN THE RUN-UP TO IT PASSING INTO

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
LAW, BY TALKING ABOUT HIS

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
THREE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
>> RIGHT NOW, SHE RUNS THROUGH

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
LIFE WITH ALL OF THE ENERGY THAT

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
SHE HAS, WITH ALL OF THE BEAUTY

27:27.000 --> 27:27.000
THAT SHE HAS WITH HER HAIR

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
NATURAL.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT SITS ON TOP

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
OF HER HEAD, IT IS WHO SHE IS.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
BUT I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORLD FULLY,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
AND SO EVEN IF SHE RUNS THROUGH

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
THIS WORLD WITH HER NATURAL

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
HAIR, THERE WILL BE A DISCUSSION

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO RUN THROUGH

27:47.000 --> 27:47.000
THIS WORLD WITH HER NATURAL

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
HAIR.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
AND WHAT SHE WILL HAVE TO LEARN,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
WHETHER SHE MAKES THE CHOICE TO

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
RUN THROUGH THIS WORLD WITH HER

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
NATURAL HAIR OR NOT, IS THAT A

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
PART OF HER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
>> John: THAT'S AWFUL.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
IT'S INFURIATING THAT

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
BLACK CHILDREN HAVE TO ADD

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
"HAIR DISCRIMINATION" TO THE

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
LONG LIST OF THINGS THEY'RE

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
ALREADY FORCED TO THINK ABOUT,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
LIKE THE THREAT OF POLICE

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
VIOLENCE, THE DANGER OF

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
HARASSMENT BY RACIST

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
WHITE PEOPLE, AND OF COURSE,

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
THE VERY REAL RISK OF GETTING

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
PHOTOGRAPHED BY UTAH STATE

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
SENATOR DERRIN OWENS

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
IN A FUCKING CHECKOUT LINE.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
THAT MAN'S DAUGHTER, AND ALL

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
BLACK PEOPLE, SHOULD CLEARLY BE

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THEIR

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
HAIR BASED ON WHAT THEY FEEL

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
LIKE DOING WITH IT, RATHER

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
THAN, "WILL THIS GET ME HARASSED

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
OR FIRED?"

28:37.000 --> 28:37.000
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
NATURAL HAIR, GREAT!

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
YOU WANT TO STRAIGHTEN

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
YOUR HAIR, GREAT!

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
WHATEVER YOU LIKE!

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
THE POINT IS, BLACK HAIR

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
SHOULDN'T BE VIEWED, CORRALLED,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
OR JUDGED BY WHITE PEOPLE'S

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
COMFORT.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BELONG TO

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
WHITE PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T AFFECT

28:50.000 --> 28:50.000
WHITE PEOPLE, AND WHITE PEOPLE

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
REALLY DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
OPINION ON IT.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
AND OUR LAWS SHOULD REFLECT

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
THAT.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
AND I KNOW THERE MAY BE LIMITS

28:58.000 --> 28:58.000
TO WHAT CROWN ACTS CAN

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
ACCOMPLISH.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
EVEN IF ONE PASSES AT THE

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE COULD

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
BE CASES WHERE A WHITE JUDGE IS

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
A SPECIFIC HAIRSTYLE IS

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
"ASSOCIATED WITH RACE" AND

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
COMPLETELY FUCKS IT UP, BUT

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
THEY ARE A START.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
AND LOOK: IF YOU'RE NOT

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
A BLACK PERSON, IT'S PROBABLY

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
EASY TO HEAR THESE STORIES AND

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
THINK "WELL, IT'S JUST HAIR,"

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
BUT THE THING IS, IT'S NOT.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
IT'S NOT AT ALL.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
HIRED, OR ARE GETTING FIRED --

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
BLACK STUDENTS ARE BEING TEASED,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
TAUNTED, AND REMOVED FROM SCHOOL

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
-- ALL BECAUSE OF THEIR HAIR.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
AND CROWN ACT LAWS COULD MAKE A

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
REAL DIFFERENCE THERE.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
AND WHILE SOCIAL STIGMA AND

29:38.000 --> 29:38.000
UNREALISTIC BEAUTY STANDARDS

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
AREN'T GOING TO GO AWAY

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
OVERNIGHT, THERE ARE A FEW

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
THINGS THAT WHITE VIEWERS,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
IN PARTICULAR, MIGHT WANT TO

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
KEEP IN MIND GOING FORWARD.

29:48.000 --> 29:48.000
AND TO THAT END,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
IF YOU ARE ONE, THERE'S A

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
MESSAGE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
HEAR.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
>> HI, WHITE PEOPLE.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
>> HI, WHITE PEOPLE.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I'M LESLIE JONES.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
>> WHAT'S UP, BLACK PEOPLE.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
>> BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
>> YOU GOOD?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
YOUR MAMA GOOD?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
>> ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I GOT TO

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
TALK TO THESE WHITE PEOPLE FOR A

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
SECOND.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
I SEE YOU AT THE MEETING.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
LOOK, WHITE PEOPLE.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I KNOW YOU HAVE LOTS OF

30:15.000 --> 30:15.000
QUESTIONS.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
>> LIKE, MAY BE TOO MANY

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
QUESTIONS.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
>> LIKE, HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
TO WASH BLACK HAIR?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
>> WHAT IS A SILK PRESS?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
>> WHAT DOES IT DO RAG DO?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO FILL YOU IN.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
WE ARE ABOUT TO GIVE YOU ANSWERS

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
TO ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT

30:32.000 --> 30:32.000
BLACK HAIR.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
>> ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
>> ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
>> GOOGLE IT.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
>> GOOGLE IT.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
>> FUCKING GOOGLE IT.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE GOOGLE.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
IT CAN BE FUCKING BING.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
>> THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
>> ONCE YOU GET THE INFORMATION,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
AND HARD WORK IT TAKES TO KEEP

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
MY HAIR LAID AND LOOKING GOOD.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
>> IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
GOOGLING IT, YOU THERE IS

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
ANOTHER OPTION.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
>> LEAVE US ALONE.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
>> FUCKING OFF IS ALWAYS AN

31:07.000 --> 31:07.000
OPTION.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
>> WHITE PEOPLE, DON'T TELL ME

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
YOU FIGURED OUT SETTLERS OF

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
CATAN.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
>> YOU FIGURED OUT SOURDOUGH.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
>> YOU CAN LEARN WHAT A BOX

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
BRAID IS, BITCH.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
>> BASICALLY, GOOGLE IT.

31:25.000 --> 31:25.000
DON'T TOUCH IT.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
>> ONE MORE THING.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
>> DON'T SPRAY MY WATER AND TAP

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
MY HEAD.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'M NOT A CAT.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
>> BYE.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

31:38.000 --> 31:38.000
