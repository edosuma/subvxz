00:03.086 --> 00:06.880
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 42477.2.

00:07.090 --> 00:10.884
The Enterprise has been diverted
to the Ramatis star system.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.013
lt seems that both sides
of a bitter planetary conflict

00:14.222 --> 00:15.264
have petitioned Starfleet

00:15.473 --> 00:19.184
to transport to their world a mediator
they have mutually selected.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.855
Our orders are transportation only,
no interference.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.232
Reduce to half impulse.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.694
Reducing velocity
to one-half impulse.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.868
[DOOR CHlMES]

00:36.036 --> 00:37.327
Come.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.372
Ah, Number One, look at this.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.833
Ever since we left
the Lima Sierra system,

00:43.043 --> 00:46.336
l've been puzzling over how the third
planet could maintain such an orbit

00:46.546 --> 00:48.547
when it's theoretically impossible.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.717
But consider this.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.803
- There's no degeneration.
- Exactly.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.139
- Why?
- Why?

00:57.348 --> 00:58.557
l haven't a clue.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.644
Well, perhaps this facsimile
lacks the proper mass.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.814
Perhaps. But if this is
an accurate representation,

01:06.024 --> 01:08.650
it could explain what happened
in that system.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.486
Perhaps.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.156
Well, it's, uh, not a matter
of any great moment,

01:14.365 --> 01:16.784
just a knot l had to untie.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.744
So, what do you want
to see me about?

01:18.953 --> 01:22.456
- Oh, we've arrived at Ramatis lll.
- Oh, well.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.583
Time to leave.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.337
- Standard orbit, Mr. Crusher.
- Standard orbit.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.839
Mr. Data, you have the Bridge.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.430
Transporter Room 5.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.269
l'm still a little uncomfortable
with your leading this away team.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.857
This is not an away team, commander.
l consider this a ceremonial function.

01:49.067 --> 01:53.445
For me not to go could be construed
as lack of interest.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.572
You will be careful, sir?

01:55.782 --> 01:58.492
Oh, cluck, cluck, cluck,
Number One.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.787
- Sir?
- You're being a mother hen.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.332
l appreciate your concern.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.128
Actually, l'm looking forward
to meeting this mediator.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.880
- Came a long way to get him.
- They wanted the best.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.883
That, according to all reports,
is Riva.

02:16.052 --> 02:20.180
lf he can put an end to all the years
of bloodletting on those planets,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.850
l think we should do everything
in our power to assist him.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.644
Our job is not
to police the galaxy, sir.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.481
lsn't that my speech, Number One?
No, of course, you're right.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.400
We must not get involved.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.777
Coordinates have been input, sir.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.780
Have your sensors indicated
any problem down there, lieutenant?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.031
None.

02:38.867 --> 02:43.078
But you're feeling a certain confusion
about this mission.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.414
No.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.583
Yes.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.043
l've never known you
to have such strong emotions,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.546
except when you're expecting
to do battle.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.510
- l am not expecting battle.
- Then what is bothering you?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.473
Riva.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.187
Ah. Riva negotiated several treaties

03:08.396 --> 03:11.607
between the Klingons
and the Federation.

03:12.317 --> 03:16.862
Before him, there was no Klingon word
for peacemaker.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.407
Then l can understand
why you're feeling uneasy.

03:21.409 --> 03:25.412
Now, look,
this is a simple ceremonial greeting.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.748
Nothing more.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.458
All right?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.752
Aye, sir.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.133
Energize.

04:41.572 --> 04:45.701
PlCARD:
Space, the final frontier.

04:46.369 --> 04:50.289
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

04:50.498 --> 04:55.669
lts continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

04:56.337 --> 05:00.549
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

05:00.758 --> 05:05.262
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.207
Captain, this is the Enterprise.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.626
We've arrived safely, Number One.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.755
But so far, we've been ignored.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.675
- l'll keep you informed.
- l would appreciate it.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.513
- Captain.
WORF: Sir.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.122
Riva.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.230
Please, come closer.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.197
Before l start,
is there anything you need?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.324
Food? Refreshments?

07:32.034 --> 07:33.368
Thank you, no.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.288
Then proceed.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.749
Greetings from
the United Federation of Planets.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.461
l'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS Enterprise.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.298
This is Counselor Troi,
Lieutenant Worf.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.885
- Greetings.
- Welcome to Ramatis.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.095
l have been expecting you.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.188
You are empathic.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.315
Yes.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.321
Then although you already know
my feelings towards you,

08:09.530 --> 08:11.740
allow me to put them into words.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.035
l am looking forward to this journey,
now more than ever,

08:15.244 --> 08:18.705
because it gives me a chance
to be in your company.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.082
l'm flattered.

08:21.292 --> 08:25.378
l, too, am looking forward
to learning more about you.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.134
There are aspects to Riva
of which we've not been informed.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.802
HARMONY:
Precisely.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.097
Our way of communicating
has developed over the centuries,

08:36.307 --> 08:39.643
and it's one
that l find quite harmonious.

08:40.561 --> 08:45.065
- Then Riva, the mediator...
- ls deaf.

08:45.274 --> 08:49.653
- Deaf?
- Born, and hope to die.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.822
And the three of you speak for him?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.699
ALL:
Yes.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.618
We serve as translators.

08:56.827 --> 09:01.039
We convey not only his thoughts
but his emotional intent as well.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.707
l am the scholar.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.042
l represent the intellect

09:04.252 --> 09:08.672
and speak in matters ofjudgment,
philosophy, logic.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.757
Also, l am the dreamer,

09:11.300 --> 09:14.094
the part that longs to see the beauty
beyond the truth,

09:14.303 --> 09:15.929
which is always the first duty of art.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.514
l am the poet who--

09:17.723 --> 09:22.394
Artists, they tend to ramble,
neglect the moment.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.898
l am passion, the libido.
l am the anarchy of lust.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.111
The romantic and the lover.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.949
l'm also the warrior,
the perfect line which never wavers.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.744
l am that
which binds all the others together.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.915
l am harmony, wisdom, balance.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.793
Remarkable.
And so the three of you--

09:47.003 --> 09:49.713
SCHOLAR: Speak to me.
PlCARD: What?

09:50.506 --> 09:53.091
Speak directly to me.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.389
This unique form of presentation

09:59.599 --> 10:01.474
provoked this inadvertent breach
in protocol.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.435
No insult was intended.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.104
SCHOLAR:
Then none is perceived.

10:06.897 --> 10:11.109
l'm curious how this rare form
of communication came about.

10:11.652 --> 10:15.322
The gene for hearing is not present
in my planet's ruling line.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.573
Not that unusual.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.492
lndeed, it is similar
to the House of Hanover

10:19.702 --> 10:22.245
on your planet Earth,
all of whom had hemophilia.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.291
Or to the leaders of Fendaus V,
who were without limbs.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.044
Many of our galaxy's
greatest contributors

10:29.253 --> 10:31.296
have been similarly special.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.256
SCHOLAR:
My Chorus is so attuned,

10:33.466 --> 10:36.676
they can hear my thoughts
and translate to you.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.138
lt is a relationship
that goes back for centuries.

10:40.348 --> 10:44.017
Their ancestors provided
the same service to my ancestors.

10:44.226 --> 10:49.439
Your method of communication
is elegant and quite beautiful.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.443
lt takes a fine mind to realize that,
Counselor Troi.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.821
This part of you doesn't speak
very often.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.200
WARRlOR:
Only when the spirit moves me.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.289
Riva, if you're ready,
the situation on Solais V is critical.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.167
- We should not delay.
SCHOLAR: Very well.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.463
- With your permission, captain.
- Make it so, Mr. Worf.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.634
Enterprise, this is the away team.
Seven to beam up.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.065
O'BRlEN [OVER COM]:
Commander Riker,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.566
the away team plus four
is onboard.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.570
Acknowledged.
Ensign, set your course for Solais V.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.656
Course is set.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.117
- Velocity, warp 8.
- Warp 8, aye.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.495
- Engage, ensign.
- Yes, sir.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.889
RlKER:
What is this?

12:05.099 --> 12:08.309
Riva is deaf.
These three speak for him.

12:08.519 --> 12:13.314
Treat them as interpreters.
Address yourselves directly to Riva.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.076
Now, may l present
my first officer--?

12:25.286 --> 12:28.371
SCHOLAR:
First, captain, may l say,

12:28.581 --> 12:32.751
it is an honor to be onboard
such a fine vessel.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.881
Now please continue
with the introductions.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.259
This is my first officer,
Commander Riker.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.805
lt is an honor to meet you.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.350
Lieutenant Commander Data.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.229
SCHOLAR:
lt is a pleasure to meet such a

12:54.690 --> 12:56.858
unique individual.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.526
Thank you.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.362
Lieutenant Geordi La Forge.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.949
lt is my pleasure to meet you, sir.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.203
- What is that you're wearing?
- A visor.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.121
lt interprets
the electromagnetic spectrum

13:10.331 --> 13:12.582
and then carries the readings
to my brain.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.959
And without it, can you see?

13:15.836 --> 13:18.421
Without it, l'm as blind as a stump.

13:19.256 --> 13:23.218
Then your visor serves
the same function as my Chorus,

13:23.427 --> 13:28.556
which interprets my thoughts
and translates them into sound.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.851
- Yes.
- And you don't resent it?

13:32.061 --> 13:35.146
- The visor or being blind?
SCHOLAR: Either.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.775
No, since they're both a part of me,
and l really like who l am,

13:38.984 --> 13:41.861
there's no reason for me
to resent either one.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.531
What is your position on the ship?

13:44.740 --> 13:47.325
l'm the chief engineer, sir.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.912
lt's a blessing to understand
that we are special.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.332
- Each in his own way.
- Yes.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.919
Yes, that's the way l feel exactly.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.257
l offer the hospitality of my vessel.

14:02.466 --> 14:06.427
And at your convenience,
there is a briefing on the Solari wars.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.888
lf you wish, l'll have you conducted
to your quarters.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.139
HARMONY:
Thank you.

14:10.349 --> 14:15.353
Perhaps, if it is not inconvenient,
Counselor Troi could escort me.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.355
With your permission.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.865
This way.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.122
What about you?

14:34.331 --> 14:37.208
At times like this,
we become an encumbrance.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.962
So if you have rooms for us...

14:41.171 --> 14:44.591
Lieutenant Worf will escort you.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.764
Riva's not what l expected.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.984
Much of what we do is similar.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.361
Yes, l suppose in a way it is.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.073
We have both learned how
to allow people to examine feelings

15:09.283 --> 15:12.160
hidden deep within their psyche.

15:12.369 --> 15:18.499
ln fact, being with you here now
is provoking an emotional revelation.

15:21.337 --> 15:25.089
You mean some emotion
buried deep within your psyche?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.509
Well, not that deep.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.139
Exactly what are you feeling?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.933
Can't you tell?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.143
Some of it.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.520
Well, l feel that soon,

15:39.730 --> 15:41.481
perhaps after the briefing
by your captain,

15:41.690 --> 15:44.233
that you will be hungry,

15:44.443 --> 15:49.489
and that perhaps we could dine
together and compare experiences.

15:49.698 --> 15:53.326
- l'd like that.
- As will l.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.954
Will he be with us?

15:56.163 --> 15:59.916
Well, until we find our own method
of communication.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.543
l look forward to that time.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.046
As do l.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.600
l'm sorry, Data, begin the briefing.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.770
The factions on Solais V
are historical enemies.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.857
So many have died that both societies
are on the verge of extinction.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.192
Enough.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.945
Thank you, captain,
there is no need to continue.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.240
The specific issues of the conflict
have no relevance.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.784
So none of the background
which we have provided

16:34.994 --> 16:38.663
would be helpful in understanding
why they continue to fight.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.708
The portfolio will indicate
that the conflict is over a piece of land

16:41.917 --> 16:45.420
or wealth
or some other tangible asset.

16:46.046 --> 16:49.215
But we both know
that is not the case.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.636
They've been at war for so long,
it has become personal.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.430
Exactly.

16:55.639 --> 16:59.934
The basis for peace
must also be personal.

17:00.436 --> 17:04.856
This is an historic confrontation,
correct?

17:05.065 --> 17:08.860
The factions have been at war
for 1 5 centuries.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.030
SCHOLAR:
What's changed?

17:13.407 --> 17:15.283
l do not understand what you mean.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.827
SCHOLAR: They have been
