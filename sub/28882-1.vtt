a universal something of which
all Jewish men are expected,

01:05.642 --> 01:08.606
though neither as much as I used to.

01:08.608 --> 01:11.519

asleep at night, you know?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.948
Have anything in that genre?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.918
Nothing too crass, obviously,

08:39.919 --> 08:42.888
just the right amount
of crass if you have it.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.207
Right.

08:44.210 --> 08:49.182
Well, we have full volumes
on the Crimean War.

08:49.184 --> 08:51.278
I think that'll help you fall asleep.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.830
Were there Speedos back then?

08:54.734 --> 08:57.878
Sorry, not that I'm aware of

08:57.880 --> 09:01.878

something a little more cheerful,

You were being mysterious.

28:03.870 --> 28:05.308
Normally when you're mysterious,

28:05.310 --> 28:06.376
it means sex.

it means for me, babe.

was pretty impressive.

29:15.922 --> 29:19.853
God, smart men, they can do things to me.

29:21.189 --> 29:25.668
Although, this information is
worth 10 times what he wants.

29:25.670 --> 29:26.958
Maybe he's not too smart after all

29:26.960 --> 29:29.640

all with the intention

29:35.023 --> 29:36.428
of putting up another more profitable one,

29:36.430 --> 29:37.928

29:37.930 --> 29:39.878
in this case, a few million to facilitate

29:39.880 --> 29:41.544

KATE: Don't our kids have a right

34:36.382 --> 34:37.634
to play in the open?

34:37.636 --> 34:39.638
Unfortunately, that's
all the information

34:39.639 --> 34:40.471
I have right now.

34:40.473 --> 34:43.098
I ensure you we are working
very closely with city planning

34:43.100 --> 34:44.128
to make sure that this gets resolved

34:44.130 --> 34:47.869
in a timely and a very fair manner.

34:47.871 --> 34:48.702
Thank you.

34:48.704 --> 34:51.643
No questions today, guys, okay?

(LIGHT CLASSICAL MUSIC)

36:12.900 --> 36:13.877
Hey.

36:13.879 --> 36:15.363
Why'd you turn the TV off?

36:17.040 --> 36:17.978
Nothing interesting.

36:17.980 --> 36:21.358
Well fine but what are you doing?

36:21.360 --> 36:23.305
Suddenly you're a hard
boiled detective over here.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.083
Did you find any fingerprints?

36:26.103 --> 36:27.848
No, just been doing
some thinking lately.

36:27.850 --> 36:31.358
Well gosh, that's certainly
something different.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.283
About what, Detective Greg?

36:34.410 --> 36:36.477
Our partnership isn't working out.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.598
Really?

36:40.600 --> 36:41.538
Since when exactly?

36:41.540 --> 36:44.458
We can't keep going in circles, Nina.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.678
Hey, it's okay.

36:46.680 --> 36:49.028
No, it's not okay.

36:49.030 --> 36:50.443
This is business, alright?

36:52.273 --> 36:55.103
You spilled the beans, you blabbed.

36:56.053 --> 36:58.598
You're a backstabbing,
bean spilling little...

36:58.600 --> 37:00.366
Don't you say it.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.718
Oh, you can discuss seeds

37:02.720 --> 37:04.808
but I can't chat about beans?

37:04.810 --> 37:05.918
It's all over the news, Nina,

37:05.920 --> 37:08.308
me and you, you and me,

37:08.310 --> 37:11.718
library, mayor scandal,
construction corruption,

37:11.720 --> 37:13.058
you blabbed.

37:13.060 --> 37:13.891
What?

37:13.893 --> 37:15.218
No I didn't.

37:15.220 --> 37:16.878
I didn't tell anybody, Greg.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.948
What about that nerd of yours?

37:18.950 --> 37:20.480
Why would I do that?

37:20.482 --> 37:23.338
Liar. You're a liar.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.698
I hate liars.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.698
You told him.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.318
I didn't tell him, honest.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.253
Miss honesty and fidelity

37:34.135 --> 37:36.818
Oh, I've got an idea,

37:36.820 --> 37:40.488
why don't we ask, yeah,
let's ask this gentleman.

37:40.490 --> 37:44.014
Hey, hey bro what's it feel like?

37:44.016 --> 37:45.016
Greg.

37:45.018 --> 37:45.849
You know where my nose was

37:45.851 --> 37:47.168
when yours was jammed in your books?

37:47.170 --> 37:48.001
Greg!

37:48.003 --> 37:48.918
Jammed up where the sun don't shine.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.601
Greg, enough!

37:50.603 --> 37:52.368
What's gotten into you?

37:52.370 --> 37:54.293
Why'd I trust you?

37:55.853 --> 37:57.853
God only knows what's gonna happen.

37:59.030 --> 38:00.498
Irreparably screwed.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.783
To think how happy we
could've been in Tampa.

38:05.801 --> 38:09.058
That's what this is about?

38:09.060 --> 38:10.558
More or less.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.698
I don't care what city you choose.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.488
I will destroy it with
my hands brick by brick.

city one more time.

Tampa's a beautiful place.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.348
Tampa can suck my ass.

Hold on, Greg.

38:45.330 --> 38:46.718
It has to be this way.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.708
Just help me understand.

Nina!

Thanks for the book.

Oh, um, this afternoon.

39:40.380 --> 39:41.530
How was your meeting?

39:43.350 --> 39:44.778
Actually if it's not too much trouble,

39:44.780 --> 39:46.780
I'd like to just eat in silence tonight.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.293
Not feeling too well,

39:50.900 --> 39:51.933
kind of tired.

You, stay there, be quiet.

40:18.330 --> 40:20.483
You, also stay.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.588
Right, pop quiz time.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.355
Now be warned, Nate, I don't repeat myself

40:27.357 --> 40:29.838
and I let things get really ugly.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.053
Sometimes I even enjoy it when they do.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.623
You must really love
looking in the mirror then.

40:36.350 --> 40:39.178
Who hired you? The mayor?

40:39.180 --> 40:40.258
What?

40:40.260 --> 40:41.758
Who are you spying for?

40:41.760 --> 40:43.868
NATE: This must be a joke.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.063
I won't ask again.

40:47.390 --> 40:49.308
You see, you see, Nina, I told you.

40:49.310 --> 40:51.483
Fine, you got me,

40:52.540 --> 40:56.808
yeah you got me... the
Mayor of the North Pole,

40:56.810 --> 40:57.798
ever heard of him?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.438
Jolly fellow, yeah,

40:59.440 --> 41:01.158
he told me to keep an
eye on the two of you,

41:01.160 --> 41:03.694
make sure you're gonna be naughty or good

41:03.696 --> 41:04.696
or something to that effect.

41:04.698 --> 41:06.208
I can't quite remember exactly what it was

41:06.210 --> 41:07.418
you see 'cause I'm Jewish.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.348
Stop it!

41:08.350 --> 41:10.298
This is serious.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.698
Why are you here?

41:11.700 --> 41:13.058
I live here.

41:13.060 --> 41:14.758
Why aren't you at work?

41:14.760 --> 41:16.426
Why did you tie me up?

41:16.428 --> 41:17.938
I don't know.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.158
It seemed like the right idea at the time.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.538
Just answer the question.

41:22.540 --> 41:23.798
Untie me.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.258
You answer the question first.

41:25.260 --> 41:26.093
I felt sick.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.133
Little heartburn.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.293
He's lying, Nina.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.408
We need to get rid of him.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.889
This is ridiculous.

41:37.891 --> 41:39.948
And please put that damn thing away.

41:39.950 --> 41:41.048
You see?

41:41.050 --> 41:41.881
You see, Nate?

41:41.883 --> 41:44.418
I told you I didn't want
that thing in our house.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.368
I told you it was bad.

41:46.370 --> 41:48.408
I told you guns were bad

41:48.410 --> 41:50.038
and you kept it in our fireplace,

41:50.040 --> 41:51.822
our fucking fireplace?

41:51.824 --> 41:53.074
Yeah.

41:53.076 --> 41:55.979
If this helps, I finally agree with you.

41:55.981 --> 41:59.078
Well whoopie, whoopie,
he agrees with me.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.788
There's one for the record books, folks.

42:00.790 --> 42:01.748
Whoopie, whoopie?

42:01.750 --> 42:03.078
You ask me to agree with you so I agree,

42:03.080 --> 42:04.568
now I'm in the doghouse for agreeing?

42:04.570 --> 42:05.538
Could anybody believe this?

42:05.540 --> 42:06.371
Could I?

42:06.373 --> 42:07.204
Can you?

42:07.206 --> 42:08.037
I...

42:08.039 --> 42:08.899
That's not the point.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.538
Greg, put it away.

42:10.540 --> 42:12.088
Yeah, listen to the lady.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.379
Hey, shut up.

42:13.381 --> 42:14.382
Hey, you shut up.

42:14.384 --> 42:15.384
- No you shut up.
- You shut up.

42:15.386 --> 42:16.592
- No you shut up.
- You shut up.

42:16.594 --> 42:17.643
No you shut up.

42:17.645 --> 42:19.638
Just both of you shut the fuck up!

42:19.640 --> 42:22.616
Greg, Nate is my husband.

42:22.618 --> 42:24.639
We can trust him.

42:24.641 --> 42:25.908
The hell you can.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.118
I might not be spying for the mayor now

42:27.120 --> 42:28.995
but I will to screw this
asshole the fuck over.

42:28.997 --> 42:30.147
Nate!

42:30.149 --> 42:31.214
GREG: See, see?

42:31.216 --> 42:32.049
Shut up, Greg.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.378
An explanation can fix this.

42:37.380 --> 42:41.343
Nate, questions remain unanswered.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.721
Right.

42:44.723 --> 42:46.608
I didn't hear a thing, okay?

42:46.610 --> 42:48.168
I didn't hear anything.

42:48.170 --> 42:51.794
Holy shit, man, I feel
asleep in the garage.

42:51.796 --> 42:53.643
You were asleep?

42:55.585 --> 42:56.838
In the garage?

42:56.840 --> 42:58.968
Yeah, it was dark, comfortable,

42:58.970 --> 43:00.418
more than you could imagine.

43:00.420 --> 43:02.238
I woke up, I see you guys
looking at the fireplace.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.438
I swear, I didn't hear anything
you were doing or seeing.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.208
I didn't hear anything
you were saying or doing,

43:06.210 --> 43:07.041
nothing.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.928
You don't think that I'm a psychic

43:08.930 --> 43:11.563
out of one of those futuristic Philip K,

43:12.800 --> 43:13.948
from a Philip K. Dick novel?

43:13.950 --> 43:14.781
You think I'm psychic?

43:14.783 --> 43:15.998
Am I psychic?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.638
I'm tied up in a fucking
chair in my own house.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.471
Am I psychic?

43:18.473 --> 43:20.694
No, you're not.

43:20.696 --> 43:22.198
I don't even know who you are.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.658
He's nobody.

43:23.660 --> 43:26.258
Trust me, he's a friend.

43:26.260 --> 43:28.398
Greg, there are other ways,

43:28.400 --> 43:31.386
kindness does the trick, bribery.

43:31.388 --> 43:35.308
I am telling you he's nobody.

43:35.310 --> 43:37.633
Hey, I am somebody.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.198
We are all somebody.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.108
Just give it a rest.

43:41.110 --> 43:42.068
You say that so often.

43:42.070 --> 43:44.559
Maybe I should just change
my name to that, you know?

43:44.561 --> 43:48.598
Mr. Nobody, See-Through Guy,

43:48.600 --> 43:49.431
The Invisible...

43:49.433 --> 43:51.988
Man, yes excellent story, love it.

43:51.990 --> 43:53.263
GREG AND NINA: Shut up!

43:57.870 --> 43:59.228
Be reasonable.

43:59.230 --> 44:03.438
No, reason, like
charity, is for suckers.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.582
Greg, just...

44:04.584 --> 44:06.251
No, you know what,

44:09.493 --> 44:10.833
just leave me alone.

44:12.008 --> 44:12.841
NINA: Oh God.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.308
Wait here.

44:16.310 --> 44:18.323
Yeah, I was kind of planning on it.

44:19.590 --> 44:22.011
Might want to get him a bath toy.

44:22.013 --> 44:24.068
There's some tissues over on,

44:24.070 --> 44:26.973
ah, fuck it, he doesn't
have a man card anyway.

44:26.975 --> 44:29.263
GREG: I came here for some privacy.

44:45.940 --> 44:47.223
Not happening.

44:47.225 --> 44:49.144
You're not on the toilet.

44:49.146 --> 44:51.463
People shit their pants all the time.

44:52.663 --> 44:54.983
But not you, right?

44:56.020 --> 44:56.853
Why not me?

44:58.935 --> 45:02.958
Because as nice as it might feel

45:02.960 --> 45:04.018
in the beginning, Greg,

45:04.020 --> 45:06.618
it quickly loses its warmth and appeal.

45:06.620 --> 45:10.458
It requires more cleanup
than originally anticipated

45:10.460 --> 45:15.460
and it just develops into
a stinky situation overall.

45:17.020 --> 45:19.883
It's not okay to shit your pants ever.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.168
I know that now.

45:22.170 --> 45:24.523
And so should you.

45:25.560 --> 45:26.393
Nina...

45:30.290 --> 45:31.948
Never mind.

45:31.950 --> 45:32.783
Forget it.

45:40.980 --> 45:41.813
I'm sorry.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.288
He has a right to be angry.

45:45.290 --> 45:47.383
Fine, maybe so,

45:47.385 --> 45:49.603
but he still knows too much.

45:50.610 --> 45:52.628
He probably overheard everything we said

45:52.630 --> 45:54.875
about the library and the mayor.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.578
These people are dangerous, Nina,

45:57.580 --> 45:58.711
they're crazy.

45:58.713 --> 46:02.203
In this situation, he's dumber than you.

46:03.295 --> 46:04.423
You think so?

46:05.858 --> 46:07.193
Greg, no.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.373
I don't understand.

46:12.660 --> 46:14.133
I'm still married.

46:19.530 --> 46:20.598
Greg...

46:20.600 --> 46:22.178
Why not Nina, come on?

46:22.180 --> 46:26.138
Because we just... an hour ago, twice,

46:26.140 --> 46:28.748
and my husband is downstairs and how?

46:28.750 --> 46:30.453
How is that even possible?

46:33.581 --> 46:34.498
Ow, ow, ow!

46:55.570 --> 46:56.983
Kind of blah actually.

46:58.410 --> 47:00.663
Blah's a good word for it.

47:02.100 --> 47:03.681
You know, the sound of vomiting.

47:03.683 --> 47:04.516
The truth is I,

47:07.670 --> 47:10.320
I've been in matrimonial
bliss for the last two years

47:11.290 --> 47:12.790
and now I'm spying on my wife.

47:33.634 --> 47:34.884
Bathroom now.

47:42.587 --> 47:44.308
Why does he get to leave?

47:44.310 --> 47:45.223
Zip it.

47:46.440 --> 47:50.036
Honestly what does she see in him?

47:50.038 --> 47:51.883
You are good looking, bro.

47:53.090 --> 47:56.593
That dude's passable, maybe at a zoo.

48:07.400 --> 48:10.226
Books, books, books, I can read a book,

48:10.228 --> 48:12.388
I can read a book for you.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.308
Mr. Freaking Encyclopedia.

That's it?

48:53.250 --> 48:54.828
There's no lecture?

You know, "Go to hell, Nate!"

48:56.060 --> 48:59.903
or "Maybe you should grow up, Nate" or ah.

Hey, Nina, look at me,

49:04.281 --> 49:05.729
we're supposed to have rules here.

49:05.731 --> 49:06.668
You're supposed to fight back.

Hello?

49:07.550 --> 49:08.838
Hey?

49:08.840 --> 49:10.209
Hello.

No, that's where you're wrong.

That's where it all falls
apart for you right there.

There are no rules, never were.

49:23.434 --> 49:26.648
Get back, I'll handle it.

49:26.650 --> 49:29.710
What can I do?

49:29.712 --> 49:31.796
Nina, tell me what to do?

Tell you what to do?

Tell you?

What do you want to hear Nate?

49:36.430 --> 49:38.808
Do you desire instructions
on how to clean up

49:38.810 --> 49:41.248
this massive life fucking disaster?

49:41.250 --> 49:42.358
So do I.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.919
I can't stand it when you get like this.

49:44.921 --> 49:46.305
What'd I do, break a lampshade?

49:46.307 --> 49:47.878
What'd I do, what did I do?

49:47.880 --> 49:48.711
I broke a lamp, I broke a lamp.

49:48.713 --> 49:50.718
You know, it is so typical of you

49:50.720 --> 49:53.268
to not even want to help clean.

49:53.270 --> 49:55.328
This is your mess too.

49:55.330 --> 49:58.428
You vacuum, I do the
dishes, that's the deal.

49:58.430 --> 50:01.463
Sure, fine, great, the deal.

50:05.480 --> 50:06.993
Don't worry, I'll get it.

50:09.420 --> 50:12.918
I have nightmares about
the dishes, nightmares.

50:12.920 --> 50:13.788
I'm over there by the kitchen sink

50:13.790 --> 50:15.108
covered in soap sud,

50:15.110 --> 50:16.768
I've got these heavy yellow gloves.

50:16.770 --> 50:18.267
Suddenly you fall in.

50:18.269 --> 50:19.262
Full of grime

50:19.264 --> 50:20.095
Into the sink

50:20.097 --> 50:21.158
and somehow you shrink down

50:21.160 --> 50:23.981
to some tiny dish size Nate mid fall

50:23.983 --> 50:26.672
and you don't know how
it happens but it does.

50:26.674 --> 50:28.339
That's right, I fall in,

50:28.341 --> 50:30.718
I fall in, my foot gets
caught under a teacup handle,

50:30.720 --> 50:32.028
I get pulled under the water

50:32.030 --> 50:34.480
and I'm drowned because of your teacup.

50:34.482 --> 50:36.158
Interesting, Nate.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.728
There's just one problem with that.

50:37.730 --> 50:40.148
In reality, I don't drink tea.

50:40.150 --> 50:40.983
I hate it.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.637
You drowned by your own teacup.

All hail Freud, I guess.

naturally to you, don't they?

Antisemite.

51:02.114 --> 51:04.508
Yes, right.

51:04.510 --> 51:05.503

a lamp over his head?

Great idea, Nate.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.638
It is, it is a great idea.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.041
- No, no.
- Yes.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.228

Just give it to me,

01:02:44.943 --> 01:02:45.965
give me the damn,

01:02:45.967 --> 01:02:47.578
give it, give it over.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.010
Nate, stop, Nate stop.

01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:52.862
Guys, this is childish, seriously.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.181
Don't tickle me.

01:02:55.183 --> 01:02:56.586
Don't tickle me.

01:02:56.588 --> 01:02:58.338
Just give it to me.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:04.303
Okay.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.978
Now, back to your story.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.458
Your childhood story about wallpaper,

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.997
some Murakami maybe,

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:17.858
talking cats or delirious
sheep men involved.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.308
I'm still on the edge of my seat.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.408
Guys, could we talk
about something else?

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:22.948
Wallpaper's not really my thing.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.158
What I was trying to say

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.690
was that my whole childhood

01:03:26.692 --> 01:03:29.163
was surrounded by that wallpaper

01:03:29.165 --> 01:03:31.528
but it wasn't until I
came home from college

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.268
that I noticed the pattern.

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:38.270
Somehow it just blended into
that whitish pinkish blur

01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:40.713
that I always saw as the house walls.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:42.973
It's funny, huh?

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:46.283
I guess we get so caught up in things,

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.190
we ignore what's right in front of us.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.738
So please let me have some of that

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.008
so I can drink myself stupid

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.588
and forget what I have missed

01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:59.223
or forgotten along the way.

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:20.373
It's not a toy, Greg.

01:04:30.473 --> 01:04:31.304
GREG: You look nice.

01:04:31.306 --> 01:04:33.268
I want to discuss the property
on Chestnut Street, Greg.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.828
Cut the shit.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.488
That monstrosity across
from the police station?

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:38.728
That old dinosaur?

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.313
If that's how you see it.

01:04:44.018 --> 01:04:45.168
It's a little tricky.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.808
May need some help on that one.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.820

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:57.163
All of it completely legal of course.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.338
At least, that's why you're here.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.708
Thing is why do you want
to do something like this?

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:05.948
It's an historical building,

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:08.588
it's popular amongst everyone really.

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.668
You're looking to annoy
some people, aren't you?

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:13.063
Are you attached to it personally?

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.583
It's beautiful, it is.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.128
The fact is I grew up around here,

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:22.243
I've spent a lot of time in that building.

01:05:22.245 --> 01:05:25.843
But I'm not a child anymore.

01:05:25.845 --> 01:05:28.583
I'm sure you can see that.

01:05:28.585 --> 01:05:33.585
And once I get something
locked in this block of mine,

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.828
good or bad,

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:37.953
it's hard to let go of it.

01:05:38.904 --> 01:05:41.270
It just stays lodged in there.

01:05:43.074 --> 01:05:47.907
I should warn you though,

01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:56.941
I can be a little difficult to deal with.

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.760
I've been told the same about myself.

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:09.668
Wait, stop, what am I doing?

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.838
Don't do this to me again, alright?

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.108
Hey, I told you, it gets easier.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.013

you to run away with me.

I hate you.

01:13:42.748 --> 01:13:44.398

You know, three sides, me, her, you...

I'll let him go, alright?

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.063
I'll walk out of here.

NATE: She's had way to much,

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.147
wouldn't do any good.

I can't.

He's right.

01:14:30.682 --> 01:14:33.603
Will you just give me a moment, Greg?

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.523
Why do you always take his side?

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.783
Why am I even here?

Well it looks like it.

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.663

We need to get free.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.658

is this, Romeo and Juliet?

to replace a roll when it's done?
