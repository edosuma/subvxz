WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:11.044
We're back and things are about
to get fucking naughty.

00:12.445 --> 00:16.015
It's going to be bigger and better
than ever before.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.651
(screaming)

00:18.718 --> 00:20.520
More kissing.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.855
Getting fucked up.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.358
Tears.
(crying)

00:25.425 --> 00:28.294
Arguing.
(yelling)

00:30.930 --> 00:32.698
Fucking tramp.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.200
(screams)

00:34.267 --> 00:36.903
(cries)
Bring it on.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.141
I'm showing Aaron
exactly what he's in for.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.309
Technically single,
I can do what I want.

00:44.043 --> 00:47.013
The fucking sly prick.
I thought we were mates.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.082
Yous are pathetic!
Fuck off!

00:49.149 --> 00:51.184
(indistinct shouting)

00:52.285 --> 00:53.753
Everyone's mortal.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.658
Let's see how he likes it when the
shoe is on the other fucking foot.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.427
You're a liar!

01:00.493 --> 01:02.061
I can't even look at Aaron.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.197
That happens
when you fuck Marnie over.

01:05.932 --> 01:08.134
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.236
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.705
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.008
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:15.074 --> 01:17.277
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:17.343 --> 01:21.214
Hardest graft I've done is my hair.
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.349
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.119
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.087
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:39.165 --> 01:40.166
Yeah.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.902
That was funny as fuck
when she swilled him!

01:42.969 --> 01:44.771
Oh, my God. I missed it.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.773
Last night it all kicked off.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.742
Marnie swilled Aaron.
Everything was going on.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.612
What was the conversation
before you swilled him?

01:52.679 --> 01:55.782
Cos we were just talking about
how he's a fucking liar

01:55.849 --> 01:58.451
and he's a fucking arsehole
and I just got angry.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.588
I can't understand why Aaron
would get a girl's number.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.891
I thought things were going well,
but I was the only one.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.938
Last night, Scott was a snake. He
told Marnie I got a girl's number.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.907
We were meant to stick together.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.848
So I'm trying to sweat
this hangover out,

02:28.915 --> 02:32.552
but I've got Aaron chirping in me
ear about what I said to Marnie.

02:44.197 --> 02:48.568
I know for a fact, right, that
Aaron would not have told Marnie.

02:48.635 --> 02:52.171
He was trying to get away with it
and if he could, he would.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.874
Yeah, OK. Fair enough.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.187
We're all hungover,
but decide to get up,

03:08.254 --> 03:11.157
do some exercise
and blow off the cobwebs.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.358
All in the hips.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.196
Ow!
Keep going.

03:22.535 --> 03:26.205
Be fit, not fat, be fit, not fat.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.008
Start as we mean to go on.
Well, exactly, aye.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.477
My fanny's, like,
getting too hairy now.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.048
Last night, I'm sure, like...
there's stray pubes everywhere.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.517
What do you mean?
You mean you're shedding?

03:37.584 --> 03:38.651
(laughs)
Oh, no!

03:38.718 --> 03:40.453
I sleep in the same bed as you.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.424
Yes, I've got a hairy vagina.
Why is everyone so shocked?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.492
I just was going through a stage.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.496
What kind of a stage, an ABBA phase?
(laughs)

03:50.563 --> 03:54.601
She needs to get to the waxer cos it
looks like Hagrid between her legs.

03:57.036 --> 03:59.138
(Holly) Are you excited?
No.

03:59.205 --> 04:03.309
So we've arrived at the salon
and Charlotte is shitting herself.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.679
I hope she doesn't get too nervous
and fart in the woman's face.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.282
Just lie down. It'll be fine.
Oh, but...

04:09.349 --> 04:13.920
It's not gonna be a big bit?
I'll just do a little bit at a time.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.390
(screams) Oh, God!

04:18.757 --> 04:22.161
(Marnie)
That's a piece of cake, that.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.163
Wait, just breathe.
Oh, God!

04:24.230 --> 04:26.132
I'm in so much pain.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.468
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.
You can do it!

04:28.534 --> 04:30.603
(screaming)

04:30.670 --> 04:32.038
Ow!

04:32.105 --> 04:34.974
(screams) I don't wanna
do underneath, like.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.744
I'm in pain, I'm in big pain.
All right, OK.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.047
There is no way I'm letting
this woman anywhere near my flaps.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.548
She can fuck right off.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.218
Wait a sec, you've whacked
a lot on there, mind.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.420
You've done that
without us watching.

04:47.487 --> 04:51.691
It's all right, it's fine.
(screams)

04:56.896 --> 04:59.098
Right now
the most important thing to me

04:59.165 --> 05:01.734
is that this woman gets
her hands off my vagina!

05:01.801 --> 05:04.837
It's a good one, though.
It's a good-looking fanny now.

05:04.904 --> 05:08.041
Well, I mean, yeah.
Apart from the hairy flaps. (laughs)

05:08.107 --> 05:11.978
I'd like to say Charlotte's vagina
looks amazing, like a porn star's,

05:12.045 --> 05:15.548
but no, it looks like an airport,
you could land a jumbo jet on that.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.650
It's so swollen.

05:18.918 --> 05:19.952
Aw, I miss them.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.466
(James) Everyone's getting ready.
I'm buzzing.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.967
It's gonna be mint.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.811
What I want is the best of both.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.213
I wanna pull Marnie and other girls,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.583
and since I'm not tied to either
that's understandable.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.118
It's never gonna happen.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.655
I tried it with Charlotte and Marnie.
It doesn't happen.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.558
Girls get feelings.
I know, man.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.760
Gary's telling us
not to get in too deep.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.329
As if I'm taking
relationship advice from him.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.708
So, let's have a good night.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.983
(Vicky) Big night out!
(cheering)

06:24.050 --> 06:26.385
Hopefully it's gonna be
a chaos-free,

06:26.452 --> 06:28.855
fun-filled night on the Toon.

06:38.431 --> 06:41.134
We get to Tup Tup
and everyone's buzzing.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.835
Let's get fucking mortal.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.544
I don't know what's going on,
but the atmosphere's electric.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.287
In the club
and Marnie's looking fit.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.489
I'm putting the graft in tonight.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.462
I want to stay mad at Aaron,

07:09.529 --> 07:12.365
but it's so hard when
he's telling us how nice I look.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.613
Wow, this is easier than I thought.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.949
I'm back in the good books. Get in!

07:33.519 --> 07:37.323
It's blatantly obvious Aaron and
Marnie are gagging for each other.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.226
I wish they'd get on with it,
so I hoy them together.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.636
Just call us Cupid from now on.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.506
But instead of a bow and arrow,
I've just got biceps.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.644
I'm happy Marnie's got
a smile on her face.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.547
I just think she's being
too forgiving with Aaron.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.450
Five minutes ago he was
getting a girl's digits.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.825
I'm taking Aaron to one side
to make sure he knows where I stand,

08:12.892 --> 08:15.328
cos if he hurts her
he'll have me to deal with.

08:24.303 --> 08:28.241
We haven't banged and barely kissed.
Why are you getting involved?

08:35.681 --> 08:39.751
Yeah, boys will be boys, and boys
might knock other boys clean out.

08:48.794 --> 08:52.298
Shit, not only have I forgiven him,
I'm necking on with him.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.000
What the hell is wrong with us?

08:54.967 --> 08:58.704
(cheering)

08:58.771 --> 09:02.375
Me and Marnie are necking on
and everyone's proper buzzing.

09:02.441 --> 09:05.144
It's like we've just got married.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.347
Marnie is all over Aaron
like Scotty on a slag.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.316
She's forgiven him quickly.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.823
Tonight's been a wicked night.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.426
No arguments,
everyone's having a good time.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.728
Time to get home
and hope Aaron gets laid.

09:31.103 --> 09:35.041
# I got a big fat forehead
I got a big fat forehead #

09:36.642 --> 09:37.643
Fuck!

09:37.710 --> 09:41.013
I don't know what I've been
drinking, but I'm fucking mortal.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.087
I was hoping to have
a cheeky snuggle,

09:48.154 --> 09:52.158
but that's not gonna happen.
Marnie's drank the bar dry.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.293
Marnie's in an absolute mess.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.264
She's playing with blow-up Brenda
in a sexual way. Fuck.

10:00.766 --> 10:05.571
I think that this top
is better on me, am I wrong?

10:07.840 --> 10:11.277
Only good thing about Marnie being
mortal is I got to see her tits.

10:11.344 --> 10:15.247
That's more than I've seen before.
Fucking take that.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.050
The only think I can think of
is that I'm angry

10:18.117 --> 10:20.186
for forgiving Aaron too easily.

10:20.252 --> 10:23.155
I'm such a mug. I should've stuck
to me guns a lot longer.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.894
It doesn't look as though
Marnie's forgiven Aaron at all.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.464
You all right, like?

10:31.530 --> 10:34.667
Things were going well.
I can't believe she ruined it.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.135
Fuck this, I'm off to bed.

10:37.570 --> 10:41.107
We're all off to bed,
but I can tell you one thing,

10:41.173 --> 10:44.343
Marnie is gonna have a hell
of a headache in the morning.

10:46.645 --> 10:49.648
Scotty T's coming for ya cherries.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.151
I'm feeling so horny.

10:54.186 --> 10:57.256
Get me back into that house
and into Marnie's knickers.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.695
It's time I told someone
what was really going on.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.398
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:23.916 --> 11:25.985
Last night Marnie proper kicked off.

11:26.052 --> 11:29.855
She was hitting us with a tray.
That girl's lost the plot.

11:29.922 --> 11:34.226
We've all been through this.
She gets pissed and loses the plot.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.295
She adores us, then she hates us.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.331
I don't know if she'll flash
her tits or cave me head in.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.735
During the day she's so, like,
nice and giggles all the time.

11:42.802 --> 11:47.339
Night time she's, like, "Fuck off."
It's like Jekyll and Hyde, honestly.

11:47.406 --> 11:50.409
Aaron's having a nightmare
whenever she gets pissed.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.213
He should just do what I did
and just sack her off.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.218
(phone ringing)

11:59.285 --> 12:01.187
(James) Phone.
(Vicky) Phone.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.555
Hello?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.691
Hi, Anna. You all right?

12:11.330 --> 12:15.568
Anna calls and tonight we're hosting
our first Tash On Tours gay event.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.002
What's the craic, Vicky?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.447
Oh, my God. I'm absolutely buzzing.

12:28.514 --> 12:32.618
We're going to Powerhouse. It's one
of the best nights out you can have.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.719
Woop-woop!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.729
I walk past Marnie's room
and she's still in bed.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.799
She's either hiding
or she's got a hangover from hell.

12:50.336 --> 12:54.573
Marnie's still in bed? The lazy fuck
slept through everything.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.009
There's a cup of tea for you.
Thanks, Kyle.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.411
Nay bother.
What happened last night?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.947
I remember being in the club,
kissing Aaron,

13:02.014 --> 13:03.349
then the rest is a blur.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.484
I was so drunk.
Yeah.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.786
I don't know what the fuck happened.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.623
What's the craic with Aaron?

13:10.689 --> 13:14.827
You hit him over the head with a...
Was it a plate or a...

13:14.894 --> 13:18.797
A plate?
Not a plate. What was it?

13:18.864 --> 13:21.600
One of them little plastic things.
Oh, thank God.

13:21.667 --> 13:25.538
I feel like the tables were turned.
It's normally him in that state.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.440
Everything was going so well.
I just had to ruin it.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.143
I have no idea
what I'm gonna say to Aaron.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.879
I'm so humiliated.
No words could fix it.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.888
Hiya.
All right?

13:42.955 --> 13:46.058
I'm in the bathroom and Marnie
comes in to speak to us.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.294
Hopefully she won't have
a tray today.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.365
I just wanna say sorry for being
a bit of a drunk mess last night.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.535
I'm really sorry.
You were a fucking nightmare.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.803
I'm sorry.

13:57.870 --> 14:02.174
Marnie needs to realise
how much of a nightmare she can be.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.580
I can't believe the first time
Aaron's seen me tits

14:07.646 --> 14:09.682
was when I was in
that drunken state.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.283
I'm so embarrassed.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.987
I think I lost me mind a little bit.
I think you did and all.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.622
I appreciate the apology,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.024
but it'll take more
to soften me up again.

14:19.091 --> 14:22.728
Well, let's just enjoy worselves.
Just have fun.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.930
Just see what happens from there.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.067
Cos I cannae be arsed going
through that again. Fuck that.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.202
I'm getting around Aaron already.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.205
I can still see a sparkle in his eye
when he looks at us.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.808
Hopefully tonight at work
it won't be that bad.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.380
Got summat to ask you.
Well, step into my office.

14:41.447 --> 14:45.084
Seeing as Vicky's got all the power,
I feel I may as well milk this.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.720
You know cos you're the boss now?
I'm the boss.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.122
You know it's my birthday?
Yes.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.658
Do you think
we could maybe have a party?

14:52.725 --> 14:56.495
Yeah, I don't see why not.
And you can make it amazing.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.064
There's gotta be some perks
to this boss role.

14:59.131 --> 15:03.335
I'm gonna show everyone
what comes before part B, Part-A!

15:09.842 --> 15:13.579
We're all getting ready for tonight.
We're going to Powerhouse.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.982
We are taking Tash On Tours
to the gay community of Newcastle.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.984
Let's go!
Whoo! Let's go!

15:19.051 --> 15:20.185
Come on!

15:26.492 --> 15:30.529
We rock up to the bar and there's
absolutely loads of gay singles,

15:30.596 --> 15:33.932
and Vicky and her big mouth is
about to get the party started.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.369
First game is just pass the cherry.
(cheering)

15:37.436 --> 15:41.140
We've decided to put yous up
against the ultimate lads.

15:41.206 --> 15:45.010
So me and the lads line up against
the singles to play the cherry game.

15:45.077 --> 15:47.246
Looks like we're getting
a lot closer.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.349
Scotty T's coming for your cherries.

15:50.416 --> 15:56.388
Go! 60, 59, 58, 57, 56...

15:56.455 --> 15:59.425
Bloody hell, these guys know
how to pass cherries.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.694
It's like watching
a game of Candy Crush.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.596
54, 53...

16:04.663 --> 16:08.600
I've always been of the opinion that
everyone's got a bit of gay in them,

16:08.667 --> 16:12.304
and if Aaron's not careful, he's
gonna have a bit of Gary in him soon.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.974
You are done!
(cheering)

16:16.041 --> 16:19.345
Now it's time for game two,
sex positions.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.347
And Kyle and Scott are going for it.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.854
Fair play, I get laid enough to know
every sexual position known to man,

16:28.921 --> 16:32.358
but playing with Kyle, I might as
well be launching a skip around.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.495
Scott's done his back in
and they've given up.

16:36.562 --> 16:41.066
They haven't even made 60 seconds,
but I suppose that's usual for them.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.171
Let's all go and get pissed.

16:46.238 --> 16:49.108
Work has been amazing
and the lads did us proud.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.711
Everyone's left with a smile
and Anna's gonna be impressed.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.417
That was one of the best
Tash On Tours we've done,

16:58.484 --> 17:01.954
so I can only imagine the club's
gonna be absolutely wicked.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.859
I hope Aaron and Marnie stop arguing.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.529
When they're good together
they look so happy.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.539
Vicky's telling us
me and Marnie are good together.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.709
There must be a reason
we keep going back to each other.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.021
Fuck it, Vicky's right.
I might as well go for it.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.823
Not as if I'm gonna pull in here.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.529
At the beginning of the night I
didn't think that this would happen,

17:43.595 --> 17:46.031
but me and Aaron are back to normal.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.369
To be honest, I really like her
and I can't keep away.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.951
Gary's asking us about Mitch. Eh?

18:09.087 --> 18:11.890
Things haven't been great
with Mitch for a long time

18:11.957 --> 18:13.659
and I don't wanna lie any more.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.628
It's time I told someone
what was really going on.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.770
It's been a while
since I talked to Charlotte.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.774
When I eventually speak to her,
things aren't as good as I thought.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.950
We're on the rocks!
What's going on?

18:40.252 --> 18:43.655
With me and Charlotte, I was
never a knight in shining armour,

18:43.722 --> 18:47.526
but if things are going wrong, I'll
always be there to make her happy.

19:01.006 --> 19:05.344
Within about 30 seconds of Charlotte
talking to Gary she's in tears.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.447
He probably asked for a threesome,
insensitive prick.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.186
(Gaz) I was talking to Charlotte
about Mitch in a funny way.

19:14.253 --> 19:17.389
Vicky goes in there
and makes her cry. Well done, Vicky.

19:32.070 --> 19:35.908
If you've got a questionable rash
on your genitals, Gary's your man.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.143
Relationship advice?
(buzzer noise)

19:41.113 --> 19:43.482
Gary is always
a touchy subject with Vicky,

19:43.549 --> 19:46.018
cos she hates him
or she's necking on with him.

19:46.084 --> 19:49.655
The fact I told Gary
about Mitch first and not Vicky

19:49.721 --> 19:51.323
hasn't went down well at all.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.170
Marnie's asking if
we should go back and have sex.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.740
She might be joking,
but I'm willing to take that chance.

20:08.807 --> 20:12.578
Out of the corner of me eye I see
Aaron and Marnie sneaking off.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.881
She's not gonna bang ya.
She'll string you along like Scott.

20:17.516 --> 20:22.087
I'm feeling so horny. I just wanna
get Aaron in the taxi and get home.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.826
Get me back into that house
and into Marnie's knickers.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.347
I was under the impression
Charlotte and Mitch were happy,

20:48.413 --> 20:50.749
but she's telling me
they're on the rocks.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.185
I can't believe
she kept this from me.

21:00.225 --> 21:03.028
The girls have got me back.
They're reassuring us,

21:03.095 --> 21:05.864
saying I shouldn't be going
through this by meself

21:05.931 --> 21:08.000
and it's making us feel
so much better.

21:14.706 --> 21:19.011
Everyone's absolutely mortal,
so it's time to call it a night.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.457
Get back to the house and Marnie
and Aaron are nowhere to be seen.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.326
I bet you they're in the shag pad

21:34.393 --> 21:37.596
and I bet you a million per cent
nothing is happening.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.769
Seems like the lads have got
the same opinion.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.605
Marnie is playing Aaron
and he's playing with fire.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.542
No.
You fucking do.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.345
You have got ME wrapped around
YOUR little finger.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.982
I started the night pissed off,
but she's got a hold on us.

21:57.049 --> 22:01.253
Tonight in general was mint craic.
Definitely, definitely, mate.

22:01.319 --> 22:04.389
Everyone's mortal. It's been
a good night. Time for bed.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.527
(Vicky) Lights off.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.103
Aaron!

22:21.673 --> 22:25.143
I know Aaron wants to sleep with us,
but he has to prove hiself.

22:25.210 --> 22:29.281
I know if I sleep with him too soon,
things can all go wrong.

22:30.315 --> 22:31.616
Happy birthday, Hol!

22:31.683 --> 22:34.386
It's my birthday.
Let's get fucking mortal.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.721
(cheering)

22:36.888 --> 22:38.757
This party is gonna be wicked.

22:38.824 --> 22:42.127
I look like a giant piece of shit.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.930
Aaron might even get lucky tonight.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.300
I shouldn't have invited that girl.
It's gonna kick off.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.936
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:09.888 --> 23:13.091
Are you OK after last night, anyway?
You were really upset.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.527
I'm OK now.
I'm glad I told yous about it.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.362
Last night Charlotte confessed

23:17.429 --> 23:19.698
things aren't good
between her and Mitch.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.534
I feel terrible
she's kept it bottled up,

23:22.601 --> 23:26.004
but hopefully now it's in the open
we can give her some advice.

23:26.071 --> 23:30.642
There's nothing wrong with admitting
things aren't perfect all the time.

23:30.709 --> 23:34.279
This is just a little bit of a low,
but it doesn't mean it's over

23:34.346 --> 23:37.382
and it doesn't mean you can't fix it
if you want to.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.452
I feel like I had
all of this bottled up inside

23:40.519 --> 23:42.454
and I could never tell anyone,

23:42.521 --> 23:45.490
but now I have,
it's a weight off me shoulders.

23:45.557 --> 23:48.827
Erm, birthday, birthday, birthday.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.029
It's your birthday.
It's my birthday!

23:51.096 --> 23:54.199
I know that it was
my actual birthday a few weeks ago,

23:54.266 --> 23:57.002
but fuck it, if the queen
can have two, so can I.

23:57.068 --> 24:00.138
Yous get to meet me boyfriend.
(gasps) Big reveal!

24:00.205 --> 24:03.008
I called him me boyfriend.
Oh, my God. What the hell?

24:03.074 --> 24:04.509
Tonight is a big night.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.979
This is the first night
my lad is gonna come to the house.

24:08.046 --> 24:12.050
Let's face it, though, Geordie Shore
and relationships don't go well.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.058
Things were going well with Marnie,
but I didn't get a bang.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.894
If it didn't happen then,
I'm not sure it ever will.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.096
Did you enjoy last night?
Yeah.

24:25.163 --> 24:28.466
You know you cannot stay mad
at us for long.

24:28.533 --> 24:33.638
Well, I tried. I tried through the
day and then thought, "Fuck it."

24:33.705 --> 24:37.776
Last night was amazing.
Me and Aaron ended up kissing.

24:37.843 --> 24:40.011
I don't know what it is about
me and him.

24:40.078 --> 24:43.515
Just somehow, no matter what
happens, we always end up together.

24:45.383 --> 24:47.419
(cork pops)
Happy birthday!

24:47.485 --> 24:51.890
Whoo! Aw, this is so cute.

24:51.957 --> 24:54.626
Holly is buzzing
with this birthday breakfast.

24:54.693 --> 24:58.396
If I didn't know better meself I'd
say she was soaking wet down there

24:58.463 --> 25:01.132
ready to hoy one of them croissants
right up her,

25:01.199 --> 25:03.969
but little does she know
I've got a present for that.

25:04.035 --> 25:06.538
You know you're obsessed
with unicorns?

25:06.605 --> 25:12.611
I thought I'd get you
a unicorn horn for your fairy.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.481
Oh, my God.
It's a dildo! (laughs)

25:16.548 --> 25:19.985
This is the best start
to my birthday party day ever.

25:20.051 --> 25:21.386
Croissants and dildos.

25:21.453 --> 25:24.623
To Holly's birthday.
Whoo!

25:24.689 --> 25:26.424
Happy birthday, Hol!
Thanks.

25:26.491 --> 25:28.760
If a unicorn dildo
hasn't got her excited,

25:28.827 --> 25:31.329
wait till she sees
what else we've got in store.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.099
(man) "Hello?"

25:34.165 --> 25:36.868
Is this the props
and fancy dress hire place?

25:36.935 --> 25:38.403
"Yeah, how can I help?"

25:38.470 --> 25:41.006
I want this place to be
a magical forest.

25:41.072 --> 25:44.876
I want Holly to be so overwhelmed.
I'm pulling out all the stops.

25:44.943 --> 25:50.849
We're thinking, like, trees, sort of
giant toadstools, smoke machines.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.686
"OK, yeah. Yeah, we can do that."

25:54.753 --> 25:57.389
It doesn't matter whether
it's belated or not,

25:57.455 --> 25:59.291
it's not a birthday without a cake.

25:59.357 --> 26:02.627
So we want it to have
gigantic breasts

26:02.694 --> 26:06.164
and then we also want mini cakes
that we can hand out to people.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.867
Like cupcakes.
Fairy cakes.

26:08.934 --> 26:13.605
So we want them to be...
actual have minge on.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.740
What?!
Like an actual minge.

26:15.807 --> 26:21.279
Holly needs a cake that showcases
her personality and her best assets,

26:21.346 --> 26:26.651
so this cake needs tits
and massive fanny flaps.

26:26.718 --> 26:29.321
It's gonna be good.
She didn't seem surprised.

26:29.387 --> 26:32.123
She must have had loads
of minge requests before.

26:34.826 --> 26:37.295
Anyway, you little shit.

26:37.362 --> 26:43.268
Sneaking off and getting an early
taxi from the club, didn't say bye.

26:43.335 --> 26:47.005
One thing I do need to find out,
after all that graft Aaron put in,

26:47.072 --> 26:48.106
did he bang her?

26:48.173 --> 26:50.709
What happened?
Did you actually get anything?

26:50.775 --> 26:52.243
Did I fuck.
(laughs)

26:52.310 --> 26:55.447
We didn't sleep together.
I don't know where I stand.

26:55.513 --> 26:58.283
It's so funny, man.
"Get anything? Did I fuck."

26:58.350 --> 27:03.188
Marnie is giving Aaron nothing.
No pleasure, no sex, just grief.

27:03.254 --> 27:06.157
With the house party tonight,
I'm gonna be shagging,

27:06.224 --> 27:08.760
Scott and Kyle'll
probably be shagging.

27:08.827 --> 27:11.863
You're either gonna have to pull
a bird and be shagging

27:11.930 --> 27:14.265
or spoon her fully-clothed.

27:14.332 --> 27:17.068
I can't, man.
Decisions, decisions, boy.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.708
We're gonna get our nails done.
Do you wanna come? OK, then.

27:23.775 --> 27:27.545
Me and Holly are going to get
our nails done so we look top notch

27:27.612 --> 27:30.982
and to get Holly out so the others
can make the house look wicked.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.518
Get your bag, Hol.
Bye, girls.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.321
I need your help!

27:36.388 --> 27:39.290
Holly wants
an enchanted forest themed party.

27:39.357 --> 27:43.528
If I want tonight to be amazing,
we need everyone to pull together.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.932
It's a mushroom.

27:54.372 --> 27:58.676
This place is really starting to come
together. Holly is going to love it.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.379
Oi, oi.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.783
It's the party tonight and Gaz
is right, I do need to pull.

28:04.849 --> 28:08.686
I like Marnie, but I'm single, so
I should be able to do what I want.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.824
Oh, aye?
I'm gonna have to invite her.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.659
Are you gonna invite her?
Yeah.

28:14.726 --> 28:15.927
(chuckles)

28:15.994 --> 28:18.496
Marnie will go nuts,
but this is what she needs.

28:18.563 --> 28:22.200
Aaron needs to be a dickhead
cos Marnie loves a dickhead.

28:22.267 --> 28:25.103
(girl) "Hello?"
Hello, is this Sarah?

28:25.170 --> 28:27.105
"Yeah."
It's Aaron, you all right?

28:27.172 --> 28:28.640
"Hiya, how are you?"

28:28.706 --> 28:32.243
We're having a house party
at the house, an enchanted theme.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.146
Do you wanna come along?
"Tonight?"

28:35.213 --> 28:40.485
"OK, I'll come up tonight then."
Sound, darling. See you soon.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.855
I'm determined to make Aaron
go and pull other girls.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.124
Hopefully he'll get a bang tonight.

28:54.265 --> 28:58.636
Holly is gonna be buzzing with this
house. She loves this enchanted shit

28:58.703 --> 29:02.307
and we've gone all out
to make sure it's unbelievable.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.376
So I'm walking Holly in
with me hands over her eyes.

29:05.443 --> 29:09.047
I'm scared!
...two, one!

29:09.114 --> 29:11.382
(screams)

29:11.449 --> 29:14.452
I can't believe it.
It's a big enchanted forest!

29:14.519 --> 29:15.687
I'm buzzing!

29:15.753 --> 29:20.291
I need to start getting ready.
I hope these are OK.

29:20.358 --> 29:23.695
I tried to pick costumes
to reflect people's personalities.

29:23.761 --> 29:27.098
So Marnie is the evil slaggy fairy
and James is the tree

29:27.165 --> 29:28.600
cos he's a bit of a sap.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.868
Eh?

29:34.405 --> 29:37.142
I'm the birthday girl.
I've gotta look the best.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.444
I'm a unicorn, I'm a unicorn,
I have a horn.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.383
Me and Kyle are fauns.
Looking good, there's one winner

29:45.450 --> 29:47.785
and it ain't him with
the pot-belly six pack.

29:51.156 --> 29:54.225
I feel like
a naughty, naughty dirty fairy.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.227
Aaron might even get lucky tonight.

29:56.294 --> 30:00.965
I'm bouncing for the party tonight.
Scotty T minotaur.

30:01.032 --> 30:06.604
Thanks a lot, Vicky.
I look like a giant piece of shit.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.142
It's my birthday, it's my birthday!

30:11.209 --> 30:15.847
Now it's time to celebrate.
Let's get fucking mortal!

30:15.914 --> 30:17.882
(cheering)

30:20.051 --> 30:23.121
Tonight is the night
I get to see me boyfriend

30:23.188 --> 30:25.957
and I've really, really missed him.

30:26.024 --> 30:27.559
I am so nervous.

30:27.625 --> 30:31.162
He's so important to us and they're
a bunch of fucking weirdoes.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.902
I intend on sitting in
my little love bubble

30:37.969 --> 30:40.905
and punching anyone in the throat
who tries to burst it.

30:40.972 --> 30:45.043
Vicky's boyfriend's arrived
and I can't help but feel like

30:45.109 --> 30:47.412
it's awkward when
someone like this comes

30:47.478 --> 30:50.014
cos no-one really knows what to do.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.518
We just stare.

30:54.552 --> 30:58.189
We'll ready for the party and
we're waiting for guests to arrive.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.391
Let's get mortal.
Happy birthday.

31:04.295 --> 31:08.366
People arrive, the party's started,
we're all buzzing, fucking mint.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.937
Oh, here she is. Bloody hell, hello.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.907
Kate's here and she's looking
absolutely unreal.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.842
Do I look nice?

31:17.909 --> 31:20.078
(laughs)

31:20.144 --> 31:23.514
As long as this face is out,
she can't resist.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.027
The birthday girl is looking
fucking mint

31:36.094 --> 31:38.196
and I'm hoping to give her
a fauny treat.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.878
I know it's my birthday, but there
will be no birthday sex going on.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.980
I'm not doing anything
and if I do,

31:56.047 --> 31:57.815
it'll be with the horn on my head.

32:07.925 --> 32:10.828
Holly's giving us reasons
why she can't get with us

32:10.895 --> 32:13.798
and all I hear is,
"I fancy you, I will get with you,

32:13.865 --> 32:15.833
I'm just trying not to right now."

32:22.774 --> 32:24.375
You all right?
Yeah, are you?

32:24.442 --> 32:26.377
You mortal?
Nah.

32:26.444 --> 32:31.049
Me and Aaron are being very flirty.
This party is gonna be wicked.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.718
Marnie is all over us

32:33.785 --> 32:37.422
and now I'm thinking maybe I
shouldn't have invited that girl.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.857
Shit, it's gonna kick off tonight.

32:39.924 --> 32:41.993
I am having the best birthday ever.

32:42.827 --> 32:44.729
Aaron has been all over that girl.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.197
(screams)

32:46.264 --> 32:50.168
I look up and see Marnie and Kyle
necking on.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.570
Whoa, whoa, shit.

32:52.637 --> 32:53.871
Fucking sides!

32:55.073 --> 32:57.642
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:16.894 --> 33:18.896
So the party is in full swing.

33:18.963 --> 33:21.532
Everyone's dancing,
everyone's mortal.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.434
I am having the best birthday ever.

33:30.441 --> 33:35.513
It's cake time and I've got all
of Holly's fanny flaps in my hand.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.119
Come and get them, boys!

33:46.891 --> 33:50.962
This is what I have always wanted,
a box full of edible fairies.

33:51.028 --> 33:52.597
I've got fairy fairy cakes!

33:57.769 --> 34:00.171
I'm buzzing,
cos if I don't get a shag later

34:00.238 --> 34:02.473
I'll end up dusting
one of these cupcakes.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.484
The girl that Aaron rang
walks in the house party.

34:13.551 --> 34:17.121
I need to get Aaron to start cracking
on with her and fuck off Marnie.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.125
Aaron, kid, you must be mental.

34:21.192 --> 34:24.896
When Marnie finds out she is
gonna go acka. I cannot wait.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.304
I'm not gonna lie, I'm nervous
about this girl turning up.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.871
There's gonna be kick-offs.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.717
Aaron hasn't even really spoke
to the girl he invited.

34:47.784 --> 34:50.588
He needs a little push,
advice to go and crack on.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.039
Gaz is right. She's come
all this way to see us

35:08.105 --> 35:10.908
so I'm gonna talk to her,
nothing wrong with that.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.382
What the fuck? Aaron's invited
that lass from work.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.853
I've gotta be
the one to tell Marnie.

35:28.025 --> 35:31.963
Oh, my God. I can't believe Aaron
has invited that girl to this party.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.998
After everything that's gone on,

35:34.065 --> 35:37.368
I can't understand what's going
on in his head to do that.

35:37.435 --> 35:38.669
Oh, my God!

35:54.318 --> 35:58.256
The party's going so well.
Everyone's having fun.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.265
For fuck's sake, the girl who Aaron
got the number from at work is here.

36:07.331 --> 36:11.435
I feel so sorry for Marnie.
If I was her, I'd be so pissed off.

36:18.776 --> 36:21.078
Charlotte's trying
to make us feel better

36:21.145 --> 36:23.080
cos Aaron hasn't done anything yet.

36:23.147 --> 36:25.616
Not being funny,
why else would he invite her?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.885
I just wanna get fucking mortal.

36:38.029 --> 36:42.867
Marnie is fucked. She's doing
anything for Aaron's attention.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.008
I'm fucking furious.

36:53.477 --> 36:56.013
I just wanna go, man!

36:56.080 --> 36:59.417
I'm worried about her. She's
the only girl I love in the house.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.018
I don't want her to get hurt.

37:01.085 --> 37:04.221
He's been talking to that girl,
she's fucking beautiful

37:04.288 --> 37:06.057
and I can't compete with the...

37:06.123 --> 37:09.527
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop that!

37:09.594 --> 37:11.762
This stupid...
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

37:11.829 --> 37:15.333
Aaron has made me feel this big.
How can he do that to us?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.234
And I hate them wings as well!

37:19.770 --> 37:23.407
Seeing Marnie this upset confirms
everything I knew about Aaron.

37:23.474 --> 37:26.611
I just hope he has the decency
to leave her alone now.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.515
I look over
and Aaron is all over that girl.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.118
(screams)

37:35.152 --> 37:39.023
Fuck it, I'm gonna make him just
as low as he's just made me feel.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.427
Unfortunately,
Kyle's the only lad close.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.799
Whoa, whoa, shit.

37:48.866 --> 37:52.937
I look up and see Marnie and Kyle
necking on.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.906
Wow, for once
I'm actually speechless.

37:58.309 --> 38:01.045
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

38:01.112 --> 38:03.447
World War Three
is about to be unleashed.

38:11.689 --> 38:15.626
Gary says that Kyle and Marnie have
just necked on, are you joking?!

38:19.430 --> 38:22.600
What is wrong with us? I've made
everything ten times worse.

38:22.667 --> 38:26.837
No, Holly, Holly.
I just necked on with Kyle.

38:26.904 --> 38:29.240
Who?!
To make him jealous!

38:29.306 --> 38:30.841
You just necked on with Kyle?

38:30.908 --> 38:34.245
What the hell is going on?
One, he's meant to be her best friend

38:34.311 --> 38:38.449
and two, he's meant to be Aaron's.
These games need to stop now.

38:38.516 --> 38:42.720
Mate, I'm really sorry,
she just done it.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.255
I know I invited that girl,

38:44.321 --> 38:47.058
but that wasn't an invite
for Kyle to kiss Marnie.

38:47.124 --> 38:49.627
I thought we were mates.
I'm sorry, mate.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.329
I can't believe I did that.
It came from nowhere.

38:52.396 --> 38:54.265
It felt like I kissed me sister.

38:54.331 --> 38:57.268
I'm so sorry, mate.
Kyle's apologising a million times

38:57.334 --> 39:00.004
and he looks like he's gonna cry.
I hope you do cry.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.540
That's what you deserve.
What have you done?

39:02.606 --> 39:05.643
I shouldn't have fucking done it.

39:10.614 --> 39:13.784
I'm so fucking angry I'm smashing
everything in the house.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.621
Aaron, calm it!

39:17.688 --> 39:20.157
But I wish it was Kyle's face.
(screams)

39:20.224 --> 39:25.629
If everyone had stuck to the people
they were meant to be kissing,

39:25.696 --> 39:29.166
none of this would've happened.
Thick!

39:29.233 --> 39:31.502
I'm genuinely sorry.

39:31.569 --> 39:35.106
The fucking sly prick
is apologising over and over.

39:35.172 --> 39:37.041
You mean nothing to me. Fuck off.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.818
Aaron and Kyle are arguing
in the bedroom.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.655
In comes Scott like Big Bird
and just starts arguing over nothing.

39:54.992 --> 39:57.728
(all argue)

39:59.196 --> 40:02.399
Gaz is going pure in on Kyle here,
but give the kid a break,

40:02.466 --> 40:05.302
it wasn't that long ago
that Gaz had done far worse.

40:05.369 --> 40:08.439
He's knocking around
with the double standards mafia.

40:14.945 --> 40:18.616
Gaz knows he's in the wrong. I can't
believe he's squaring up to us.

40:18.682 --> 40:22.486
I've inhaled bigger meals than him
for breakfast, the little radgie.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.125
(arguing continues)

40:30.427 --> 40:32.696
This argument is out of control.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.066
There's fans and chairs across
the room, the table's fucked.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.974
It's like a war zone.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.010
Fucking hold this, man.

40:46.076 --> 40:50.080
I'm absolutely raging.
I don't want Kyle in here any more.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.652
It's all kicked off

40:54.718 --> 40:57.655
so surprise, surprise,
the guests are going home.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.423
What an absolute disaster.

41:02.393 --> 41:05.262
I've ruined me friendship
with the lads in the house

41:05.329 --> 41:06.997
over a stupid drunken neck-on.

41:07.064 --> 41:08.632
(Marnie cries)

41:11.735 --> 41:15.005
I feel drained after
everything that's gone on tonight

41:15.072 --> 41:18.709
and I feel upset cos it's a
situation I don't know how to fix.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.684
Tonight was meant to be
a fairy tale fantasy,

41:26.750 --> 41:30.120
but instead it's turned
into a fucking nightmare.

41:30.187 --> 41:32.089
Right now I just need me mam.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.900
All night I've been grafting
this one bird.

41:42.967 --> 41:46.604
I'm gonna leave them the drama
and get in the bedroom.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.843
The party was unreal
until the sly prick ruined it.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.746
I'm so angry I'm just breaking
anything that I see.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.882
This night is a fucking disaster.

42:02.119 --> 42:05.990
Tonight hasn't gone well. I feel
like I've fucked things up here.

42:07.758 --> 42:10.594
I'm gonna make the most
of having this bird in bed.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.103
Kyle's pissed me off, so fuck it,

42:19.169 --> 42:22.006
he can have some of my love juice
all over his sheets.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.574
Enjoy your bed tonight.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.245
Night, everyone.
I'm off to bed with me fit lad.

42:32.716 --> 42:36.420
Despite all the kick-off,
I have had a wicked birthday.

42:36.487 --> 42:40.090
The night has been unreal, but now
I'm knackered. I'm going to bed.

42:40.157 --> 42:41.425
Peace out, bitches.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.096
We've all got to go to work tonight.
It's in Paris.

42:46.163 --> 42:47.298
(screaming)

42:47.364 --> 42:50.868
Je m'appelle Scotty fucking T.
Paris!

42:52.670 --> 42:54.371
(cheering)

42:54.438 --> 42:57.007
Safe to say
we're all absolutely mortal.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.811
There is no chance
I am allowing Charlotte

43:00.878 --> 43:03.013
to go anywhere near Gary tonight.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.283
Me and Gary are just friends.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

43:06.350 --> 43:08.218
(cries)

43:08.285 --> 43:10.054
I need to leave.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.855
I can't keep on going this way.
