09:45.619 --> 09:48.920
Yes, but since when
do you carry those?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.021
Oh, I got it all.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.957
Altoids, butterscotch candy,

09:51.959 --> 09:54.359
Jelly Bellies, and
Turkish delight.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.894
(phone ringing)

09:55.896 --> 09:57.395
Hello?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.897
It's someone named Gertie.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.799
Is that a girl in your class?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.534
I know a lot of Gerties.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.369
Did it sound like she was
talking through her throat?

10:04.371 --> 10:07.238
Uh, I'll just give you
the phone.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.407
GERTIE (through electrolarynx):
<i> Hello, sweetie, I didn't know</i>

10:09.409 --> 10:12.410
<i> if you wanted</i>
<i> PlayStation or Xbox,</i>

10:12.412 --> 10:15.113
<i> so I got both.</i>

10:17.618 --> 10:19.484
Maw-maw? I ordered
so many toys,

10:19.486 --> 10:20.752
you get
free shipping.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.053
Oh, so thoughtful.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.756

I know exactly
what you're up to.

I'm not up to
anything, lady.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.169
(through electrolarynx):
This is for you.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.406
Thanks for coming to
my brother's wake.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.874
It's what I do.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.118
You are a cold little customer.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.853
Agreed. Now,
are we done here?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.188
Because I've got birthday
checks to deposit.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.624
I've got birthdays
like Lindy's has pickles.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.427
Do you even know what
that means? Do you?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.796
What is this? Pick On
the Con Artist Day?

11:04.798 --> 11:08.133
I'll pay you $100 to pick me up,
four days in a row,

11:08.135 --> 11:09.701
from the Sunnyday Nursing Home.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.870
Sunnyday,
that's on Fifth, right?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.372
Yes. Ask for Phoebe Pratt.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.442
Oh, my dear, you look
like Cybil Shepherd.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.144
I am Cybil Shepherd.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.013
Impossible, Cybil Shepherd
is notoriously difficult.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.515
Aah!

11:23.517 --> 11:25.750
Oh, my God, everyone,
it's Cybil Shepherd!

11:34.528 --> 11:37.028
So it turns out you
can buy Peeky creatures

11:37.030 --> 11:38.963
with real money.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.200
But the fun of the game is
catching them, not buying them.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.169
Lisa, I can think of
no better investment

11:44.171 --> 11:46.004
than invisible creatures
that are part of an over-hyped,

11:46.006 --> 11:47.305
passing fad.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.707
Please?
I'm in.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.010
You know, I'm really
starting to like you.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.611
Mmm.
Mmm.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.381

two grandmothers.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.194
Sunnyday is a secure facility.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.030
A family member
must sign me out.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.699
Why are you there?
You seem normal.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.901

Well, that forest over there.

Mm, I better come with you.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.077
Those woods are full of bullies.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.746
So, did you get it?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.048
Yep, here's
the orzo.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.717
You idiot, you were
supposed to get ouzo.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.220
Orzo is, like,
thick, brown rice.

Homer?
Uh... what?

19:09.749 --> 19:12.316
I know about the $600.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.584
You're right, Marge.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.819
We spent too much.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.087
Bart was a gigolo.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.321
What are you gonna do?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.789
Be mad at the world?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.658
(groans) Maybe you
could say something

19:20.660 --> 19:22.193
to make me feel better.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.761
The kids are fine.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.330
The game is a fad,
and in no time at all

19:26.332 --> 19:28.866
you'll be worried
about something else.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.836
Huh, I do feel better.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.939
Hmm, you know, the last
couple of pies I baked

19:34.941 --> 19:36.340
haven't been great.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.942
There you go.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.224
I like your hair. Finger-combed?

19:53.226 --> 19:55.560
Yes, because I decide
how my hair looks.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.228
MRS. SKINNER:
Seymour!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.730
Just wanted to tell you
I'm here with a real man.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.000
My silhouette's replacing
yours on the stairs.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.669
<i> (Milhouse chuckles)</i>

20:04.671 --> 20:06.704
So enjoy your meal, son.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.005
I'm buying dessert.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.507
Oh, that's so nice.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.741
For you,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.343
not that son-snatcher.
