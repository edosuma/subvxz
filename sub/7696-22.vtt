03:42.263 --> 03:43.514
You know me, Bruce.

03:43.597 --> 03:45.683
Staid banker, old conservative stock.

03:45.766 --> 03:48.102
I'm the last person to act impulsively.

03:48.185 --> 03:50.604
But I'm telling you,
this fellow is a revelation.

03:51.021 --> 03:52.398
You should read this.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.651
Dad, you're not gonna proselytize Bruce.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.653
Now you hush, Lisa.

03:57.945 --> 04:00.281
We're raising a generation of cynics.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.784
"Nostromos." Yes, I've read
about him in the <i>Star Enquirer.</i>

04:03.868 --> 04:07.204
Uh, Alfred likes to pick up a copy
now and then.

04:07.329 --> 04:09.457
That man saved my life.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.376
He warned me not to go
on the gambling cruise.

04:12.501 --> 04:15.087
Two days out to sea, the ship sank.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.589
A coincidence.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.924
What about the cave-in
at the Zanza mines?

04:19.049 --> 04:21.427
Or the fires at the Karobi oil field?

04:21.677 --> 04:23.637
His predictions saved me a fortune.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.473
Make a heck of a stockbroker.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.435
Tomorrow I'm hosting a party
in Nostromos' honor.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.896
I want you to be there
to see for yourself.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.272
Sounds great.

04:33.355 --> 04:35.608
But I'll have to check
my horoscope to be sure.

04:43.657 --> 04:45.242
You don't believe in this guy
at all, do you?

04:45.701 --> 04:49.288
Call me crazy, but sometimes
I think his predictions come true

04:49.371 --> 04:50.831
because he makes them happen.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.170
Only thing I do know is these days,
my father won't make a move without him.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.173
Daddy's even part
of a secret brotherhood.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.091
Secret brotherhood?

05:01.425 --> 05:03.594
He won't even tell
his own family what it's about,

05:04.094 --> 05:07.973
thanks to Mr. All-Wise,
All-Wonderful Nostromos.

05:17.691 --> 05:18.692
Peace to all.

05:19.026 --> 05:20.486
Brothers and sisters,

05:20.653 --> 05:23.113
the negative plane is aligned
with the positive,

05:23.239 --> 05:25.533
bringing forth astral harmony.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.659
What?

05:27.076 --> 05:30.079
The vibrations are right for prophecy.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.122
Oh. Okay.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.251
That which you seek and cannot find,

05:35.376 --> 05:36.377
is the seeker.

05:37.127 --> 05:40.214
You are merely the eye
trying to view itself.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.716
This is awfully deep.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.721
We are but radios
for the cosmic transmitter.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.849
Tune your receivers.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.851
Hear the inner voice.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.021
What is going on?

05:56.146 --> 05:58.566
Brother Ethan, the inner voice speaks.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.401
Someone here is in grave danger.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.580
The messenger of death is searching,

06:13.247 --> 06:15.082
crying out for...

06:16.500 --> 06:17.668
You!

06:39.648 --> 06:41.609
But, how did the glass break, sir?

06:42.693 --> 06:45.696
Psychic vibrations, Alfred.

06:46.488 --> 06:49.033
Though I'd bet on
a high-frequency sonic device.

06:52.369 --> 06:53.954
But I have some tricks of my own.

06:54.496 --> 06:57.458
I lifted Nostromos' fingerprints
at the party.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.836
There he is. Alias Carl Fowler.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.047
Professional actor.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.632
Arrested for petty larceny.

07:06.383 --> 07:08.385
Otherwise, no criminal record.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.224
That's his partner.

07:14.516 --> 07:16.644
Lucas. Special-effects man.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.312
Arrested for fraud.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.647
Never convicted.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.232
So, they were both in show business.

07:22.441 --> 07:23.442
Still are.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.487
I just wish I knew
where this act was going.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.048
Hi, Mr. Wayne.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.634
I hear your personal elevator
is working great now.

07:49.176 --> 07:50.719
The repair guy was just out.

07:51.136 --> 07:53.305
Really? I didn't know
there was anything wrong.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.722
No one could have predicted
Batman would spot me.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.766
Not even the great Nostromos.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.770
Besides, how do you know Wayne survived?

10:05.145 --> 10:06.855
The news said he got off the elevator

10:06.980 --> 10:09.691
right before it fell,
you pathetic amateur.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.028
Well, you didn't predict
he would die, exactly.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.949
Fool! Can't you see how his death
would have affected the Brotherhood?

10:17.324 --> 10:19.243
How vulnerable they would have felt?

10:19.701 --> 10:22.246
We could have finally hit them
for all they're worth!

10:24.581 --> 10:27.126
Peace to all.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.296
Nostromos, I must see you at once.
It's about Bruce Wayne.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.048
Bruce Wayne?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.801
Mmm-hmm. A miracle has happened.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.636
Bruce has seen the light.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.475
It wasn't until that moment,
when I came so close to death,

10:43.934 --> 10:46.979
that I realized you really did have
a divine connection.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.523
To think I ridiculed you.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.942
Can you ever forgive me?

10:52.901 --> 10:54.153
Of course.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.156
I rejoice in your soaring consciousness.

10:57.906 --> 10:59.783
Nostromos, I was thinking,

10:59.867 --> 11:03.120
a man of Bruce's standing,
his influence,

11:03.203 --> 11:05.831
should he not be considered
for the Brotherhood?

11:06.832 --> 11:09.084
Yes. It's preordained.

11:10.752 --> 11:13.172
Welcome, Brother Bruce.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.299
No, not Bruce!

11:16.216 --> 11:17.384
Lisa, you

11:18.093 --> 11:19.386
don't understand.

11:19.469 --> 11:21.763
Oh, I understand, all right.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.265
You're like all the rest,

11:23.348 --> 11:26.768
suckered in by
this money-grubbing, bogus creep.

11:26.935 --> 11:28.145
Lisa!

11:28.812 --> 11:31.565
You know what my inner voice
tells me, Nostromos?

11:31.732 --> 11:33.901
You've ripped off your last victim.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.865
I'm so sorry. I...

11:39.948 --> 11:41.116
Do not apologize.

11:41.408 --> 11:42.618
She will believe.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.494
They will all believe,

11:44.745 --> 11:46.413
after the Great Fall.

11:49.499 --> 11:51.752
You may have joined us
just in time, Bruce.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.671
For months Nostromos
has been warning the Brotherhood

11:54.796 --> 11:56.673
of an economic collapse in the West.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.342
"The Great Fall"?

11:58.800 --> 11:59.843
Exactly.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.720
But, at Nostromos' direction,

12:01.803 --> 12:04.806
we've set up a superfund
to protect ourselves.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.810
After the fall, we can use it
not only to rebuild fortunes,

12:09.269 --> 12:11.146
but society as well.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.690
And I take it that Nostromos
controls this money.

12:13.941 --> 12:17.361
Oh, no, he can't touch it
without my written approval.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.781
Nostromos insisted
everything be aboveboard.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.366
Of course.

12:31.124 --> 12:34.419
And though,
tonight we bask in the radiance

12:34.544 --> 12:36.922
of Brother Bruce's conversion,

12:37.047 --> 12:39.299
it grieves me to burden your spirits

12:39.424 --> 12:40.968
with solemn news as well.

12:41.593 --> 12:44.638
The Great Fall is at hand.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.266
The Great Fall.

13:08.161 --> 13:12.374
<i>The omens rise and converge
with every passing moment.</i>

13:12.499 --> 13:14.042
<i>Yes, my brethren,</i>

13:14.167 --> 13:16.044
<i>the inner voice speaks.</i>

13:16.586 --> 13:19.339
I now see a dawn of destruction.

13:23.176 --> 13:24.177
Pillaging!

13:24.303 --> 13:25.429
Carnage!

13:25.554 --> 13:28.056
A society out of control!

13:29.433 --> 13:31.601
Oh, the torment!

13:31.893 --> 13:33.395
The suffering!

13:42.738 --> 13:45.157
<i>The vision becomes clear.</i>

13:47.826 --> 13:50.078
Brothers, beware!

13:50.787 --> 13:51.955
Argh!

13:59.796 --> 14:01.089
I am fine.

14:01.590 --> 14:06.845
Brethren, you must transfer all you can
to the Brotherhood's fund by tomorrow.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.222
The stars are
in their proper confluence.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.266
Signs and portents abound.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.895
As prophets of old foretold
cataclysmic changes,

14:15.020 --> 14:18.190
so now, I predict
a massive social upheaval!

14:18.357 --> 14:20.108
This is the end of the old order.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.110
Anarchy and chaos will abound.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.946
The Great Fall has begun.

14:31.745 --> 14:35.040
You gave them $10 million, sir?

14:35.415 --> 14:38.418
And to think,
I was fretting over the electric bill.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.546
I had to keep up appearances, Alfred.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.341
There must be over $300 million
in that fund.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.009
My word!

14:46.385 --> 14:50.680
Well, at least Nostromos can't touch it
without Mr. Clark's authorization.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.057
For now.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.018
But I don't need to be psychic
to predict that Ethan Clark

14:55.102 --> 14:57.646
is about to undergo a spiritual crisis.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.214
Well, Lucas,

15:24.423 --> 15:25.632
our benevolent brothers

15:25.715 --> 15:28.468
transferred another
63 million this morning.

15:28.677 --> 15:32.722
I predict, you and I
are about to become as rich as pigs.

15:35.016 --> 15:36.143
Nostromos!

15:36.226 --> 15:37.269
Huh?

15:42.065 --> 15:43.442
Out. Out!

15:44.401 --> 15:45.902
Nostromos.

15:47.028 --> 15:48.363
I got your message.

15:48.488 --> 15:51.032
I'd have been here sooner,
but I've been trying to locate Lisa.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.659
She didn't come home last night.

15:52.784 --> 15:55.745
The inner voice assures me she is fine.

15:56.037 --> 15:57.164
Do you know where she is?

15:57.539 --> 16:00.792
Do not worry.
I see you joining her soon.

16:02.043 --> 16:04.504
Right now,
we have urgent business to discuss.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.298
The voice has warned

16:06.381 --> 16:08.675
that the Brotherhood's fund
is in jeopardy.

16:09.092 --> 16:10.218
What do you mean?

16:10.385 --> 16:13.180
We must convert it
into gold bullion at once.

16:13.388 --> 16:15.765
I've prepared the papers
for your signature.

16:16.725 --> 16:21.438
But, Nostromos, I can't possibly sign
until I've notified the brothers.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.939
There's no time!

16:23.315 --> 16:25.025
But, they must be informed.

16:25.108 --> 16:26.776
It's our obligation.

16:27.068 --> 16:29.446
Perhaps the stars can persuade you.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.199
I see a bad moon rising.

16:34.409 --> 16:35.535
Lisa!

16:39.539 --> 16:40.832
Sign!

16:43.043 --> 16:46.922
Nostromos, what is this?
I don't understand.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.258
Sign! Or she pays.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.843
Why would you do this?

16:51.927 --> 16:54.638
I believed in you. You saved me.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.931
Please, Nostro...

16:57.641 --> 17:00.101
I have one last prediction for you,
Ethan.

17:00.393 --> 17:02.229
The end will be swift.

17:02.562 --> 17:05.607
Brother Lucas has set
enough explosives in this place

17:05.732 --> 17:07.859
to create a supernova.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.529
I suggest you make your peace quickly.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.744
Ooh!

17:20.038 --> 17:21.498
The control room!

17:28.004 --> 17:29.214
Up there.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.522
You go that way.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.125
Your turn to see the light.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.501
Batman?

19:46.434 --> 19:49.270
You're about to fall
out of orbit, Batman.

21:23.907 --> 21:27.327
I can't believe
I was so gullible.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.705
But that's what I get
for putting my faith in greed.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.335
You weren't the only one, Daddy.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.420
Guilty as charged.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.047
As the Bard once said,

21:39.380 --> 21:43.259
"The fault lies not in the stars,
but in ourselves."

22:19.546 --> 22:20.547
English - SDH
