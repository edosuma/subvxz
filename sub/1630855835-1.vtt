What are you up to
there, stewie?

00:37.872 --> 00:41.290
Big birthday party today,
just finishing up my card.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.834
"happy birthday, gurt"?

00:43.961 --> 00:45.502
Yeah, it's short for "yogurt."

00:48.257 --> 00:49.590
I like the blue truck.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.383
Thanks. It was supposed
to be a fire engine,

00:51.510 --> 00:53.385
But I couldn't find
the red glitter pen.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.138
Well, that's our long-form
tax return done.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.973
I could be wrong, but I think

00:58.100 --> 00:59.349
We're getting
a million dollars back.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.061
Oh, I'm glad you're here.
I ran out of bleach

01:02.146 --> 01:04.063
Halfway through
my mustache treatment today,

01:04.106 --> 01:06.023
So, peter, I'm gonna need you
to take stewie

01:06.108 --> 01:07.524
To the bowling alley
for a party.

a few fine delegates, huh?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.500
Peter, I don't think you
learned the word "delegate."

01:24.585 --> 01:27.628
I will not be delegated
in my own house.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.379
This is gonna be fun, stewie.

let's stick it to the british

01:36.305 --> 01:37.930
And throw this tea overboard.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.431

Okay, you know what,

breakfast, right?

01:43.354 --> 01:45.813
-Here goes the chamomile.
-No, no, no. You throw that out,

01:45.940 --> 01:47.481
You're throwing
my good night's sleep away.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.733
How about this throat coat
with echinacea?

01:49.860 --> 01:51.527
Okay, you guys
are gonna hate me,

01:51.612 --> 01:52.903
But we're coming up
on cold and flu season.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.613

that would be irresponsible.

-Well, what about--
-you know what,

Hey, want to put
quesadillas in our mouths

02:15.511 --> 02:17.177
And flip through
a<i> people</i> magazine later?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.805
Oh, I'd love to,
but this is our busiest day.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.224
I got five parties
and that guy over there

02:22.351 --> 02:25.310
Insists he can only bowl
like fred flintstone.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.938

the whole time?

You ever get your ass handed
to you, sports-wise?

Not yet, stewie, but if
you throw the ball the way

03:04.977 --> 03:07.895
You threw back that cake,
you should be in good shape.

But I don't exactly
have a lot of suitors.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.811
In miami beach, same as me.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.563
What? Wait!

19:50.648 --> 19:52.315
But-but I'm the hot grandma!

19:52.400 --> 19:54.692
[gasps]
you're a grandma?

19:54.777 --> 19:56.819
You look amazing!

19:56.863 --> 19:58.946
Oh, you. Come on.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.240
Could a grandma wear this
to a spin class?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.035
I mean, yes, she could,
because I did,

20:04.162 --> 20:05.912
So that happened.

20:05.997 --> 20:06.946
Thank you, meg.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.623
You've completed our family.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.959
We have our baby
and we have you.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.294
Well, I guess that means

20:13.379 --> 20:15.796
I can get rid
of all my hot grandma merch.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.965
I'll just donate it to goodwill.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.134
You know what "gilf" means,
right?

20:20.220 --> 20:22.637
Yeah. "god, I love fentanyl."

20:22.805 --> 20:24.347
You said it, pal.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.021
Well, bruce and jeffrey,
I got to say,

20:32.106 --> 20:33.648
You two have really stepped up

20:33.733 --> 20:35.691
To become
a couple of great dads.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.776
Thank you, lois.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.069
You sound a bit surprised,

20:38.154 --> 20:40.571
Which seems right
for a woman with that haircut,

20:40.657 --> 20:43.032
But you're sweet to say so.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.784
-[fussing]
-uh-oh.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.119
Someone's being
a little fussy britches.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.412
Oh, she's tired.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.790
You get the lights
and I'll sing her to sleep.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.333
[fussing continues]

20:52.460 --> 20:54.961
[imitating thumping
club bass beat]

20:55.046 --> 20:57.463
[fussing stops]

20:57.590 --> 21:00.299
Yeah, that seems about right
for a guy with that haircut.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.510
[quietly] thank you, peter.
