M_I_SForEver

00:47.056 --> 00:48.857
<i>Do you understand?</i>

00:50.126 --> 00:51.193
Ms. Chen!

00:51.227 --> 00:52.962
Oh... sorry?

00:55.630 --> 00:57.133
I said, if ruled today

00:57.166 --> 01:00.169
that you did indeed plagiarize
your last history essay

01:00.568 --> 01:03.072
you will not have fulfilled
enough arts credits

01:03.105 --> 01:05.942
to receive your Computer
Science degree next week.

01:07.910 --> 01:09.078
So, Ms. Chen,

01:09.111 --> 01:10.146
do you understand

01:10.478 --> 01:12.915
the consequences
of today's hearing?

01:14.016 --> 01:15.051
I understand.

01:15.918 --> 01:18.921
Professor, the floor is yours.

01:23.858 --> 01:26.561
Okay, um... well...

01:26.594 --> 01:28.097
I am so sorry.

01:28.331 --> 01:30.967
The streetcars were backed up
all the way on St. Clair.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.734
- Have you started yet?
- No.

01:32.767 --> 01:34.536
I was just about to inform
everyone

01:34.569 --> 01:35.637
that I think it's best

01:36.005 --> 01:37.839
that this case be led
by Mr. Ward here.

01:37.872 --> 01:39.041
Yes. Thank you.

01:39.075 --> 01:40.642
And who are you?

01:40.675 --> 01:41.776
I'm Keith Ward.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.546
I'm one of Prof. Thornton's
teaching assistants

01:44.579 --> 01:45.780
And he is also my PhD advisor.

01:46.282 --> 01:47.816
Why are you here?

01:48.250 --> 01:49.818
Well, I'm the one

01:49.851 --> 01:51.686
who originally
caught April cheating.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.990
And, thus, we both decided
that it would be best

01:54.023 --> 01:56.225
for me to present the case
against her here today.

01:56.591 --> 01:58.660
What is this, Alan?

01:58.693 --> 02:00.296
Well, as you'll see, Richard,

02:00.329 --> 02:02.731
Keith has a history
with the student in question.

02:02.764 --> 02:03.798
Wait.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.667
Just to be clear,

02:05.700 --> 02:08.669
does the professor even really
believe April cheated?

02:08.937 --> 02:11.007
Of course he believes it.
We both believe it.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.275
I'd like him to answer
for himself.

02:13.708 --> 02:15.144
I'm sorry, who are you?

02:15.478 --> 02:17.913
Micah Shaw, student advocacy.

02:19.647 --> 02:20.715
Student advocacy?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.052
Of course you'd get a lawyer.

02:23.085 --> 02:24.753
Actually, I was assigned
to April's case

02:24.786 --> 02:26.755
- and in the interest of...
- Go ahead.

02:30.159 --> 02:32.861
I know I didn't do anything
wrong, so just...

02:32.895 --> 02:35.297
go ahead. Whoever.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.602
Mr. Ward, it would appear
the floor is yours.

02:40.635 --> 02:42.804
Okay. Thank you.

02:48.810 --> 02:50.112
I'd like to start off

02:50.346 --> 02:52.614
by thanking the tribunal
for being here today.

02:52.647 --> 02:55.650
I'm sure there are places that
you would rather be on a Friday.

02:55.985 --> 02:57.987
But, frankly, I'll take any
excuse I can get

02:58.020 --> 02:59.721
to get away
from my thesis.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.329
I'll begin by
showing how April Chen

03:08.097 --> 03:12.368
has shown a history
of deceit and disrespect

03:12.401 --> 03:15.104
towards myself and
this university.

03:15.570 --> 03:19.341
You see, this all began
in our Poli Sci 100 class.

03:22.677 --> 03:24.313
April, hi.

03:25.181 --> 03:26.916
Please, have a seat.

03:32.088 --> 03:36.591
So, this is your second
year here at DuPont, correct?

03:36.892 --> 03:37.960
Yeah.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.962
And where are you from?

03:39.995 --> 03:42.730
Uh, my family moved here
from China when I was 9.

03:43.032 --> 03:44.200
What part of China?

03:44.233 --> 03:46.235
It wasn't a major city.

03:47.036 --> 03:48.104
I might know it.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.906
It's called Harbin.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.110
It's in the north.

03:55.377 --> 03:57.645
Yeah, I... I think
I've heard of it.

03:57.679 --> 04:00.015
The north,
right, yes, um...

04:01.683 --> 04:03.385
So, your paper.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.387
Now...

04:05.753 --> 04:07.755
as you can see here, the...

04:07.789 --> 04:09.024
Oh, uh...

04:09.058 --> 04:10.359
I got it.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.895
Thank you.

04:12.928 --> 04:14.096
Trying to quit, you know?

04:14.430 --> 04:16.731
Yeah, know. I gave up
on that a while ago.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.000
Smoking?

04:18.434 --> 04:20.202
No. Trying to quit.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.275
Your paper.

04:27.276 --> 04:29.011
You see these two passages?

04:30.412 --> 04:32.214
See that they're the same?

04:34.483 --> 04:36.784
Everything else in your
paper is cited,

04:36.818 --> 04:40.022
so do you think maybe you just
forgot to cite this paragraph?

04:44.193 --> 04:46.028
Will I be penalized?

04:49.331 --> 04:52.001
- I'll let you off this time.
- Okay.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.669
But keep an eye on it in
the future, all right?

04:54.970 --> 04:56.071
Sure.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.043
I appreciate you coming in.

05:02.777 --> 05:04.146
No problem.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.219
Okay. So you let her go?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.255
Yes, but that is besides
the point...

05:13.289 --> 05:16.025
Why didn't you report this
to Prof. Thornton?

05:16.392 --> 05:19.161
With all due respect,
I don't think people like you...

05:19.995 --> 05:23.332
I don't think that those
outside of the teaching faculty

05:23.365 --> 05:25.767
understand what it's like
for us TAs.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.337
You see, there's just so many
students for us to deal with

05:28.370 --> 05:30.172
and I can't waste
Prof. Thornton's time

05:30.206 --> 05:32.074
with each and
every minor infraction.

05:32.107 --> 05:34.143
Oh, sorry.

05:47.456 --> 05:48.490
So...

05:49.124 --> 05:51.694
this takes us to the second
time I met with April.

05:55.164 --> 05:56.198
Hello?

05:56.432 --> 05:58.833
April. Have a seat.

06:05.274 --> 06:07.343
Can you please tell me
in your own words,

06:07.376 --> 06:09.478
what academic
integrity means to you?

06:10.845 --> 06:12.780
Oh, um...

06:13.282 --> 06:15.351
I guess it means
being original

06:15.384 --> 06:18.520
and, um, citing
your sources?

06:19.288 --> 06:22.424
The reason I ask is
because I'm wondering if this

06:22.658 --> 06:24.826
is in line
with what you just said.

06:32.568 --> 06:33.969
This is your paper

06:34.403 --> 06:37.072
and this is a paper that was
published just last year.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.241
Do you notice anything?

06:40.009 --> 06:42.378
'Cause aside from a few
minor cosmetic changes,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.881
these two opening paragraphs
are essentially identical.

06:47.216 --> 06:49.518
I've never seen that
other essay before.

06:50.219 --> 06:52.820
Listen, I'm just trying
to find out if this

06:52.854 --> 06:55.157
supports your own definition
of academic integrity.

06:57.526 --> 06:59.561
I'm not a cheater.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.166
Okay.

07:04.866 --> 07:07.236
If that's how you feel,
then I have no choice

07:07.269 --> 07:09.104
but to hand this off
to Prof. Thornton.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.906
And he can deal with you.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.243
Goodbye.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.418
I'm very
disappointed in you.

07:30.292 --> 07:32.895
I then handed that paper over
to Prof. Thornton.

07:33.295 --> 07:34.330
Sir?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.099
Uh, okay, yeah.

07:38.167 --> 07:41.869
I, uh, questioned Ms. Chen
on the details of her essay,

07:42.304 --> 07:45.007
and I concluded that the
similarities between the papers

07:45.040 --> 07:47.076
were just a mere coincidence.

07:47.109 --> 07:48.644
I didn't feel it was necessary

07:48.677 --> 07:50.646
to bring that to the tribunal
at that time.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.015
Because you believed
that she didn't cheat?

07:53.048 --> 07:55.351
Yes, that became apparent
when I spoke with her.

07:55.384 --> 07:56.885
Although, I don't blame Keith

07:56.919 --> 07:58.354
for bringing this matter
to my attention.

07:58.387 --> 07:59.655
It was an honest mistake.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.557
Alan, your
teaching assistant here

08:01.590 --> 08:04.193
seems to be trying to
establish a pattern of deceit.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.163
Do you feel perhaps you were
deceived in this case?

08:09.098 --> 08:11.934
No, I think I know a liar
when I see one, Richard.

08:12.301 --> 08:14.269
Huh. You sure about that?

08:17.072 --> 08:18.407
Yeah. I'm sure.

08:19.308 --> 08:20.576
Professor, I have to ask,

08:20.909 --> 08:24.446
do you think that we're all here
today because of another

08:24.480 --> 08:27.049
what you might call
"honest mistake"?

08:27.383 --> 08:28.417
No.

08:29.084 --> 08:31.653
I believe that April's
third and final essay...

08:31.687 --> 08:33.956
The one that
we're judging here today.

08:33.989 --> 08:37.393
Yes, that essay
was, indeed, plagiarized.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.294
Which brings me...

08:40.629 --> 08:42.498
Why don't we all quickly
take a break?

08:42.798 --> 08:45.334
You think we could
get the AC on?

08:45.367 --> 08:46.402
Yes, please.

08:46.869 --> 08:49.004
They must have
shut it off for the summer.

08:49.037 --> 08:50.439
I'll see if I can
get someone in.

08:59.047 --> 09:00.516
You judge many of these?

09:01.316 --> 09:02.384
Nah, not really.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.653
If you're from
student advocacy,

09:04.686 --> 09:06.688
that means you're still
in law school, right?

09:06.722 --> 09:09.992
Yeah, applying to firms soon

09:10.025 --> 09:12.728
and they love this kind of shit
on a resumé.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.164
Oh. See, I would have thought
you were doing this

09:15.197 --> 09:18.000
just for the satisfaction of
helping out the less fortunate.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.135
You know how much
law school costs?

09:20.569 --> 09:22.271
I <i>am</i> the less fortunate.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.674
That you?

09:25.707 --> 09:28.110
Oh, yeah. It's nothing.

09:32.448 --> 09:33.715
<i>Josh, I'm right here.</i>

09:33.749 --> 09:35.083
<i>You can't keep pretending</i>

09:35.117 --> 09:36.285
<i>you don't notice me.</i>

09:36.618 --> 09:38.420
You write for a student
newspaper, Russ.

09:38.454 --> 09:39.521
No one notices you.

09:39.822 --> 09:41.557
Tell me about
this tribunal

09:41.590 --> 09:43.292
about a female
computer science student?

09:43.325 --> 09:45.194
I didn't know there
were any girls in CS.

09:45.227 --> 09:46.495
That's a bit
sexist.

09:46.528 --> 09:47.529
It's just the facts.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.598
Aren't they a fifth of your
department?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.066
That's a shortage.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.435
Can't force women to
major in Comp Sci.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.270
Like we can't force you
to major in something useful.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.772
What's that supposed
to mean?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.507
We don't need
any more liberal artists.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.608
We need more plumbers.

09:59.943 --> 10:01.677
Thanks for the
career advice.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.412
You're already
good at shovelling shit...

10:03.445 --> 10:04.713
I know that,
as the department rep,

10:04.746 --> 10:06.148
you sit on those tribunals.

10:06.448 --> 10:08.083
I can't talk
about my tribunal duties.

10:08.116 --> 10:09.585
Well, here's what I know
so far...

10:09.618 --> 10:11.386
it's a girl and I hear that
she's Asian.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.589
Well, Asians, those we don't
have a shortage of.

10:18.227 --> 10:19.661
Please forget I said that.

10:20.128 --> 10:23.098
Bro, what do you take me for?
It's forgotten.

10:23.632 --> 10:25.467
So tell me about this tribunal.

10:26.602 --> 10:28.170
Okay, okay.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.506
Her name's April Chen.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.641
She created a publishing
platform

10:32.674 --> 10:34.543
that got bought out
by Snakeskin.

10:34.576 --> 10:36.645
There's already a job waiting
for her in the valley.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.580
Also, it doesn't hurt that
she's, you know...

10:38.614 --> 10:39.781
What?

10:40.082 --> 10:42.584
Oh, a hot female computer
science star.

10:42.618 --> 10:45.220
In our world, we call that
a unicorn. So are we good?

10:45.254 --> 10:46.288
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.357
I just need one more
thing from you.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.092
What?

10:51.627 --> 10:53.695
Okay. Thank you.

10:55.497 --> 10:58.300
Should be
cooling off shortly.

11:00.736 --> 11:02.070
First time?

11:02.437 --> 11:03.472
Yeah.

11:04.172 --> 11:07.142
I was just promoted
to co-chair of the department.

11:07.175 --> 11:10.612
However, this? This was not
in the job description.

11:12.114 --> 11:14.316
Seems like you and Alan
know each other well.

11:14.349 --> 11:16.285
Yeah, we went to grad
school together.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.253
Quite the long friendship.

11:19.321 --> 11:21.189
Ah, I wouldn't say
we're friends.

11:26.828 --> 11:29.097
Hey. Just so you know,

11:29.131 --> 11:30.766
you shouldn't feel obligated
to talk.

11:30.967 --> 11:33.135
I mean, you know,
if you don't want to.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.670
Why wouldn't I talk?

11:34.703 --> 11:37.205
Because that's
kind of my job.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.742
I'm here so you don't have to
go through this thing alone.

11:42.311 --> 11:44.813
Can you please stop coddling me?

11:45.180 --> 11:49.318
I'm not some kind of victim.
I'm just innocent, okay?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.286
Okay.

11:54.623 --> 11:56.558
Typical administrative
bureaucrat.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.860
She has no idea what it
means to be an academic.

11:59.461 --> 12:03.198
This pantomime of a court is
what you asked for, Keith.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.534
And you got it.

12:08.303 --> 12:10.872
Sir, I really think we should
be working together on this...

12:10.907 --> 12:13.542
Together? You went
behind my back.

12:14.343 --> 12:16.812
Only because there wasn't
any time.

12:16.845 --> 12:18.680
If I didn't petition
for this tribunal,

12:18.714 --> 12:20.482
- she would have graduated.
- Right, right.

12:20.515 --> 12:21.683
And you think it was right

12:21.985 --> 12:24.586
to drag me into your little
crusade? Hm?

12:25.354 --> 12:27.823
When I got the email
from Judge Judy over there

12:27.856 --> 12:29.157
approving this hearing,

12:29.424 --> 12:30.893
I was too embarrassed
to tell her

12:30.927 --> 12:33.128
I didn't know what she was
talking about.

12:33.328 --> 12:36.598
All because you didn't go
through the proper channels.

12:43.839 --> 12:45.874
I heard back from Belgrade
this morning.

12:47.643 --> 12:48.677
And?

12:51.914 --> 12:53.348
Oh, shit.

12:53.883 --> 12:55.517
You just have to keep applying

12:55.717 --> 12:57.920
until you find a university
that's the right fit.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.422
You'll get hired eventually.

13:00.789 --> 13:02.424
Yeah.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.235
I find it helps with
the cravings.

13:17.006 --> 13:18.407
I'm good.

13:19.976 --> 13:23.578
Mr. Ward?
Ready when you are.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.187
The reason that we are all
here today

13:32.387 --> 13:35.457
is because of April Chen's
final essay

13:35.490 --> 13:37.592
for International History 300.

13:38.061 --> 13:41.663
This paper examines the role
that the atomic bomb played

13:41.697 --> 13:43.900
in Japan's surrender
of World War II.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.601
The essay offers
a succinct analysis

13:46.635 --> 13:48.470
of the Hasegawa interpretation

13:48.503 --> 13:51.673
which posits that the Japanese
decision to surrender

13:51.707 --> 13:55.277
was not because of the two
nuclear bombs dropped on them.

13:55.677 --> 13:58.480
No. The real reason
that they surrendered

13:58.513 --> 14:00.248
was because of
a little-known pact

14:00.282 --> 14:01.951
with the Soviets
that fell through.

14:02.151 --> 14:05.520
Now, this theory
is controversial because...

14:07.322 --> 14:09.926
You know what? Ms. Chen?

14:10.592 --> 14:13.228
Would you like to expound
further on the subject?

14:17.733 --> 14:18.901
The...

14:22.337 --> 14:24.306
The interpretation
is controversial

14:24.339 --> 14:27.309
because it basically suggests
that after the war,

14:27.342 --> 14:30.712
Japan elicited the sympathy
of the international community

14:30.746 --> 14:33.849
by portraying itself
as the victim of an atrocity,

14:33.883 --> 14:36.052
and used it to overshadow
their role

14:36.085 --> 14:38.787
as the violent aggressors
they were earlier in the war,

14:38.820 --> 14:40.622
such as during
the rape of Nanking.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.024
And Pearl Harbor, of course.

14:42.058 --> 14:43.692
Yes, that is virtually
identical wording

14:43.725 --> 14:45.494
as to what is
in this essay right here.

14:45.527 --> 14:47.829
So, you're gonna accuse me
of plagiarizing myself...?

14:47.863 --> 14:49.531
Well, only someone
who's worried

14:49.564 --> 14:50.665
about being caught
for plagiarism

14:50.699 --> 14:51.968
would go through the effort

14:52.001 --> 14:53.368
of memorizing a paper.

14:53.401 --> 14:54.536
So I know my topic too well.

14:54.569 --> 14:56.438
No, you know it too precisely.

14:56.471 --> 14:57.672
You see, it doesn't matter.

14:57.873 --> 14:59.508
If you question April,

14:59.541 --> 15:01.443
she will regurgitate
the words for you

15:01.476 --> 15:03.445
like some kind of robot.

15:03.478 --> 15:06.648
Now, if I may, I would like
to call my first witness.

15:07.150 --> 15:10.352
Mr. Ward,
while I don't have any issue

15:10.385 --> 15:12.320
with you calling
any witnesses,

15:12.354 --> 15:14.422
this isn't a court of law.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.093
We can't exactly
put people under oath.

15:17.126 --> 15:19.795
We would like
to call in witnesses

15:19.828 --> 15:21.730
to testify on April's
behalf, as well.

15:21.763 --> 15:22.864
You can't.

15:23.199 --> 15:24.666
We are within our right
to question...

15:24.699 --> 15:25.734
No!

15:26.169 --> 15:28.403
We're here to prove that
plagiarism has occurred.

15:28.436 --> 15:29.871
That's why we're all here.

15:30.072 --> 15:32.507
We're not here so that
she can bring in her people

15:32.541 --> 15:34.643
to prove that such a thing
did not occur.

15:35.610 --> 15:36.946
This is my case to prove.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.019
Uh, if I may?

15:44.619 --> 15:46.788
I think we should let the
student defend herself

15:46.822 --> 15:48.390
in whatever way she wants.

15:49.624 --> 15:50.993
I mean, that just seems fair.

15:51.426 --> 15:53.062
I'm inclined to agree.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.631
We have to try and treat this
like a real court room,

15:56.665 --> 15:58.968
even if it is
just a simulation of one.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.368
Or a simulacrum.

16:01.636 --> 16:02.671
What?

16:03.438 --> 16:06.374
The precise term for what we're
doing here is a simulacrum.

16:07.776 --> 16:09.344
Are you quite finished?

16:12.581 --> 16:14.150
Let's get on
with it then.

16:19.821 --> 16:21.023
Deborah!

16:27.930 --> 16:29.464
Hi, Irene!

16:29.764 --> 16:31.600
So, uh, how was your first day?

16:31.633 --> 16:33.668
Did you meet everyone or...?

16:33.702 --> 16:34.971
Almost, I think.

16:35.004 --> 16:36.504
I just finished speaking

16:36.738 --> 16:38.740
with the Vice-Provost
to Academic, Theresa?

16:38.773 --> 16:40.609
Actually, it's "Ter-essa".

16:40.642 --> 16:44.446
She's the Vice-President
of Faculty and Academic Life.

16:44.679 --> 16:48.050
Oh, I thought you were the VP
of Faculty and Academic Life.

16:49.618 --> 16:51.586
No, I'm the Assistant
Vice-President

16:51.620 --> 16:54.489
of the Office
of Academic Operations.

16:54.522 --> 16:55.958
And that's separate from

16:55.992 --> 16:57.759
the Vice-President
of Students and...

16:57.792 --> 16:59.996
Undergraduate Education,
yeah. That's right.

17:00.029 --> 17:02.664
Okay, so, as
Academic Integrity Officer,

17:02.697 --> 17:04.432
I'm under the purview of...

17:04.465 --> 17:05.902
That would be my supervisor,

17:05.935 --> 17:08.037
the Vice-President and Provost
of DuPont.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.637
Oh. I see.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.142
So are you my boss
or am I yours?

17:16.878 --> 17:19.915
Well, technically,
I'm your superior.

17:19.949 --> 17:22.084
Oh, my gosh! I know, I was...

17:23.617 --> 17:25.186
Never mind.

17:25.854 --> 17:28.925
So, I'm having a small dinner
party next week

17:28.958 --> 17:30.893
with some potential donors

17:30.927 --> 17:33.461
and I think it would be
a good idea if you'd be there.

17:33.495 --> 17:35.730
Oh! I'd love that.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.601
We'll be spotlighting the new
recruitment initiatives in Asia.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.736
Great. I'll look over
the material.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.838
No, you don't need
to look over the materials.

17:43.872 --> 17:45.840
What's important for you
to understand

17:45.874 --> 17:48.077
is that it's a sensitive time

17:48.110 --> 17:50.880
to be marketing Western
education in that region.

17:50.913 --> 17:56.085
There's a growing perception
that Canadian schools

17:56.118 --> 18:00.789
are as unaccommodating to
foreigners as the American ones.

18:01.489 --> 18:05.227
But our message is clear:
we're not like the Americans.

18:06.162 --> 18:07.762
We're better than them.

18:08.264 --> 18:10.632
Yes. We are.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.175
You know,
the little twerp's right.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.944
Technically, we are
engaging in a simulacrum.

18:23.778 --> 18:26.781
Which doesn't make him any less
of a very real little shit.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.253
I'm sorry.
May I please take this call?

18:32.587 --> 18:33.755
Mr. Ward?

18:35.424 --> 18:37.193
My witness just got off
the streetcar

18:37.226 --> 18:38.995
so he's gonna be
another five minutes.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.629
- Make it quick, Ms. Chen.
- Thanks.

18:49.338 --> 18:50.705
Hi, Mum!

18:53.142 --> 18:54.877
How was your flight?

19:04.020 --> 19:05.121
Yeah.

19:07.223 --> 19:09.591
I'm at lunch with friends.

19:12.028 --> 19:14.130
Uh, yeah.

19:16.098 --> 19:17.732
Okay. Bye, Mum.

19:20.169 --> 19:21.836
I have a proposition for you.

19:22.171 --> 19:23.671
We can end this here and now.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.608
If you just admit what you did
to me,

19:26.641 --> 19:29.178
I'll let you re-write the essay
and I'll mark it next week.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.049
So, I'll miss the ceremony?

19:33.449 --> 19:35.951
Yeah, but who cares?
They'll mail you your degree.

19:37.086 --> 19:38.653
I think you're a good kid.

19:38.853 --> 19:41.157
You made a mistake
and I can forgive you.

19:41.656 --> 19:44.726
As long as you just admit
what you did and apologize.

19:46.328 --> 19:47.662
Apologize?

19:47.997 --> 19:49.031
Yes.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.334
I'm not a cheater.

19:56.038 --> 19:58.107
You sure you want all those
people in there

19:58.140 --> 19:59.674
to find out
who you really are?

20:00.608 --> 20:03.745
We don't need to go through
all of that. Do we?

20:07.083 --> 20:09.251
I'm okay with who I really am.

20:11.020 --> 20:12.288
Are you?

20:21.863 --> 20:24.033
Tell us your name
and what you do.

20:24.366 --> 20:26.768
Ian Reed. I'm a Poli Sci
grad student

20:26.801 --> 20:28.736
and teaching assistant
here at DuPont.

20:29.004 --> 20:31.107
And what are you
currently working on?

20:31.307 --> 20:33.409
My dissertation is
preliminarily titled

20:33.442 --> 20:35.945
"Peace, Order and Good Gnocchi:

20:35.978 --> 20:38.981
Understanding Quebec's
Italian Diaspora."

20:39.381 --> 20:42.717
And when you're marking
students, can you tell us

20:42.750 --> 20:44.887
how you detect if a paper's
been plagiarized?

20:44.920 --> 20:45.921
Sure.

20:46.422 --> 20:48.690
The main thing
is inconsistencies

20:48.723 --> 20:49.791
within the essay.

20:50.192 --> 20:52.394
What do you mean
by "inconsistencies"?

20:52.595 --> 20:54.263
Well, for example,

20:54.629 --> 20:57.665
if the first and last paragraph
of an essay is poorly written,

20:57.699 --> 21:00.402
but the middle section is
perfect, that's a red flag.

21:01.036 --> 21:03.038
Hm. What else?

21:03.872 --> 21:06.075
If the student's previous work
was sloppy

21:06.108 --> 21:08.077
but then suddenly the writing
is pristine...

21:08.277 --> 21:09.711
that's another red flag.

21:09.912 --> 21:11.779
Thank you. That's all I have.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.781
I'd like to ask
a few questions.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.217
Uh, just a moment.

21:16.784 --> 21:18.254
I'm the one

21:18.287 --> 21:19.421
that's supposed to be asking
the questions.

21:19.455 --> 21:20.890
I want to do it myself.

21:20.923 --> 21:22.124
That's not how
this works.

21:22.158 --> 21:23.192
I don't care.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.127
Stop me if I start
doing something stupid.

21:25.161 --> 21:26.362
I'm trying to.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.068
So, are you saying

21:33.102 --> 21:34.802
that any time someone's
writing gets better,

21:34.836 --> 21:36.238
that means they're cheating?

21:36.505 --> 21:37.973
No, of course not.

21:38.007 --> 21:39.942
Students can improve, right?

21:39.975 --> 21:41.977
I mean, isn't that
the whole point here?

21:42.278 --> 21:44.914
Certain types of students
do improve, yes.

21:45.247 --> 21:48.050
Okay. Um, what types are those?

21:48.850 --> 21:51.253
They tend to ask a lot
of questions during class,

21:51.654 --> 21:54.890
email me about assignments,
come to office hours.

21:54.924 --> 21:56.758
The type to hire
a writing coach?

21:56.791 --> 21:58.160
Yes, of course.

21:58.194 --> 22:00.095
I have some experience
in that area.

22:00.329 --> 22:02.131
You've been a writing coach.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.832
I am now. Yes.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.435
But not for my students,
of course.

22:06.468 --> 22:09.138
But you did help students
write their essays?

22:10.206 --> 22:13.108
Not exactly, no.
I wouldn't say that.

22:13.142 --> 22:16.178
Do you think that you are kind
of helping students cheat?

22:16.212 --> 22:19.348
Wha... Of course not.
I would never do that.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.251
But they are paying you to help
make their essays better, right?

22:22.284 --> 22:26.388
No, that's not... I mean, yes,
I will give them notes.

22:26.422 --> 22:29.058
But that doesn't mean I'm
their... their ghost writer

22:29.091 --> 22:30.326
or anything like that.

22:30.825 --> 22:34.230
I would charge them way, way
more if that were the case.

22:36.365 --> 22:38.067
Which it never will be,

22:38.100 --> 22:40.369
because I would never do
that sort of thing.

22:41.370 --> 22:43.105
No matter how much they paid me.

22:43.138 --> 22:46.741
Ms. Chen, is there a point
to this line of inquiry?

22:46.976 --> 22:49.311
Oh, I just wanted to show that
getting writing help

22:49.345 --> 22:50.946
isn't the same as cheating.

22:52.114 --> 22:54.383
So, established. Anything else?

22:54.416 --> 22:58.020
Yes! I'd like to call
my first witness.

22:58.988 --> 23:02.891
My name is Mark Lin and I was
April's writing coach.

23:03.492 --> 23:05.793
What kinds of things
did you teach me?

23:06.128 --> 23:08.230
Essay structure,
thesis statement,

23:08.264 --> 23:11.500
crafting supporting
paragraphs, citation...

23:12.534 --> 23:14.069
The essentials, basically.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.038
Thank you.

23:32.087 --> 23:33.489
Are you in academia?

23:34.089 --> 23:37.092
I'm a former grad student,
yeah.

23:37.393 --> 23:39.194
Uh, poli sci.

23:40.195 --> 23:41.829
What were you working on?

23:42.364 --> 23:45.401
Uh, my thesis was titled
"You Sunk My Battleship:

23:45.434 --> 23:47.936
A Game Theoretical Approach
to Right of War Protocols

23:47.970 --> 23:50.239
Between American Pleasurecraft
and Maritime Piracy."

23:51.607 --> 23:53.509
I never finished it.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.211
Not everyone finishes.

23:56.779 --> 23:58.380
How long did you
tutor April for?

23:59.548 --> 24:00.815
A few months.

24:01.383 --> 24:03.519
That doesn't seem like
nearly enough time

24:03.552 --> 24:06.021
to teach the craft
of essay writing, does it?

24:06.622 --> 24:09.958
Do you think you significantly
improved her writing skills?

24:10.759 --> 24:13.861
Well, I don't know
what you mean "significantly".

24:14.096 --> 24:16.498
I mean that her writing skills
changed significantly

24:16.532 --> 24:17.900
for the better.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.368
Have you seen her past work?

24:19.635 --> 24:21.036
No, I haven't.

24:21.070 --> 24:22.104
Well, I have.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.907
Her previous two essays
were B-minus at best.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.642
And that's even with the help

24:26.675 --> 24:29.011
- of her plagiarizing them, as well.
- Objection!

24:32.448 --> 24:34.983
Yep, okay. Thank you.

24:36.485 --> 24:39.988
What I'm trying to say
is that you don't know

24:40.022 --> 24:42.224
if you helped her
in the slightest, do you?

24:42.691 --> 24:44.593
I'm sure I helped her.

24:44.626 --> 24:47.930
I mean, I taught her all the
essay structures and everything.

24:47.963 --> 24:49.331
In fact...

24:51.133 --> 24:54.303
you don't know if you taught
her anything at all, do you?

24:56.372 --> 24:58.507
Have you ever written
an essay for money?

25:03.112 --> 25:04.146
What?

25:04.847 --> 25:07.683
Are you now or are you ever
been a writer for hire?

25:07.716 --> 25:08.984
No!

25:09.385 --> 25:11.120
Tutoring's not enough money
to live off,

25:11.153 --> 25:12.254
what else are you doing?

25:12.287 --> 25:13.322
Nothing.

25:13.856 --> 25:15.924
- Just this.
- Where is this going?

25:15.958 --> 25:18.060
You couldn't get a job
as a grad school dropout,

25:18.093 --> 25:19.328
and you needed money, right?

25:19.595 --> 25:21.597
And then when April hired you
to be her tutor,

25:21.630 --> 25:23.298
you saw that
she was struggling

25:23.332 --> 25:25.467
and you offered to write her
entire essay for.

25:25.501 --> 25:28.103
- Didn't you? Didn't you?!
- I write erotic fan fiction!

25:35.244 --> 25:36.278
What?

25:38.046 --> 25:41.517
I have a site where
people donate to me

25:41.550 --> 25:45.921
to write erotic stories about
Korean popstars or...

25:46.688 --> 25:48.090
you know...

25:48.690 --> 25:51.260
characters
from books and cartoons.

25:54.396 --> 25:55.464
Cartoons?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.601
What is the name of your site?

26:21.623 --> 26:23.325
I think we've seen enough.

26:24.593 --> 26:25.961
Mr. Ward?

26:27.162 --> 26:28.230
Nothing further.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.075
Break?

26:40.108 --> 26:41.143
Sure.

26:41.176 --> 26:42.211
Yes, please.

26:42.578 --> 26:44.413
I think I need
to go bleach my brain.

26:53.155 --> 26:56.158
- <i>Josh, buddy!</i>
- You gotta stop calling me in there.

26:56.191 --> 26:57.493
<i>I tried texting.</i>

26:57.526 --> 26:59.294
Yeah, I know.
I'm a little busy.

26:59.328 --> 27:00.362
Yeah, about that.

27:00.696 --> 27:02.197
Take the phone
out of your pocket

27:02.231 --> 27:03.265
and put it on the table.

27:03.298 --> 27:04.333
I can't hear shit.

27:04.366 --> 27:05.400
No, no way.

27:05.701 --> 27:07.035
That's gonna
look too suspicious.

27:07.069 --> 27:08.103
Don't be paranoid.

27:08.303 --> 27:09.538
No one's
gonna know I'm listening.

27:09.571 --> 27:10.739
<i>Alright, fine.</i>

27:10.772 --> 27:11.807
Just stop texting me.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.075
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

27:13.742 --> 27:15.677
<i>I need to know who
the dean's office sent over.</i>

27:17.813 --> 27:19.748
Or I could just write the story

27:19.781 --> 27:21.550
about how you feel
there are too many Asians

27:21.583 --> 27:23.051
in the CS department.

27:23.619 --> 27:26.255
All I said was we don't
have a <i>shortage</i> of Asians...

27:26.755 --> 27:28.090
<i>in the department.</i>

27:28.323 --> 27:29.758
How do you think
that's gonna play

27:29.791 --> 27:31.493
with your Asian colleagues?

27:31.527 --> 27:33.262
<i>Of which there are
many, apparently.</i>

27:33.595 --> 27:34.663
Deborah Lewis.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.099
<i>Her name's Deborah Lewis.</i>

27:38.534 --> 27:39.701
Hello?

27:39.735 --> 27:41.603
<i>Keep the phone on the table.</i>

27:42.804 --> 27:44.039
Hey.

27:44.373 --> 27:45.440
Hey.

27:46.408 --> 27:49.211
If I could just get by...?

27:49.244 --> 27:50.812
- Oh. Yeah, sorry.
- Alright.

27:51.580 --> 27:56.184
Hey, I wanted to say thanks for
sticking up for us back there.

27:56.218 --> 27:57.252
What?

27:57.619 --> 27:59.288
Yeah, look,
you guys should be able

27:59.321 --> 28:00.522
to have your own witnesses.

28:00.556 --> 28:01.823
That's like a
no-brainer.

28:02.190 --> 28:04.126
Is it always run like this?

28:04.326 --> 28:05.360
Like what?

28:06.128 --> 28:09.097
Like you guys are just making
up the rules as you go along.

28:09.665 --> 28:11.466
Yeah.

28:12.467 --> 28:14.136
That is messed up, man.

28:14.403 --> 28:16.738
Yeah. Ya know...

28:31.153 --> 28:32.788
Something on your mind, Richard?

28:33.088 --> 28:35.591
Do you remember the last time
you spoke to me, Alan?

28:37.359 --> 28:39.394
- Uh, 10 minutes ago?
- No.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.263
It was the day
you looked me in my eyes

28:41.463 --> 28:43.265
and you lied
about how it wasn't you

28:43.298 --> 28:45.334
who sent that
letter to the tenure committee.

28:45.935 --> 28:48.537
You remember that
letter, don't you?

28:48.770 --> 28:51.506
The one that recommended
they deny me my tenure?

28:51.707 --> 28:54.242
Well, I guess I never got
a chance to congratulate you...

28:54.276 --> 28:56.712
- But no thanks to you.
- ...on your tenure.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.848
I thought we were friends.

29:00.749 --> 29:02.551
I am your friend, Richard.

29:02.818 --> 29:05.320
Now, please,
if you'll excuse me?

29:05.354 --> 29:06.521
No, you're not.

29:07.489 --> 29:09.391
Friends don't snub friends

29:09.424 --> 29:12.260
and they certainly don't try
to de-rail their careers.

29:13.495 --> 29:16.231
Are you jealous of my work,
Alan? Is that it?

29:24.941 --> 29:26.608
Look at you, Richard.

29:26.875 --> 29:29.611
You're a grown man holding me
hostage in a bathroom.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.482
You think maybe there might be
someone else in the department

29:33.515 --> 29:35.717
who thinks you're a little
unfit for tenure?

29:37.319 --> 29:38.787
It wasn't me.

29:40.422 --> 29:41.757
Now, excuse me.

29:48.965 --> 29:52.668
Richard, for your own
sake, let it go.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.965
Goodness, he looks
worse for wear.

30:23.166 --> 30:24.599
What?

30:25.168 --> 30:27.536
You'd think he was
the one on trial.

30:29.771 --> 30:31.908
I think I've figured out
what his crime is.

30:32.808 --> 30:37.546
The fashion police arrested him
for looking like a total cliché.

30:43.585 --> 30:45.420
My name is Kelly Nakashima

30:45.454 --> 30:47.456
and I've been April's roommate
for two years.

30:47.689 --> 30:49.424
Did you see me working
on this essay?

30:49.458 --> 30:50.625
Yeah, for sure.

30:51.027 --> 30:53.495
You were stressed out for,
like, half the semester.

30:53.528 --> 30:55.397
Okay. Thank you.

31:02.071 --> 31:04.740
Did you see any history
books next to April?

31:05.440 --> 31:07.009
I dunno. Probably.

31:08.510 --> 31:10.612
Did she talk to you at
all about her essay?

31:11.346 --> 31:12.514
No.

31:13.348 --> 31:16.384
Did you proofread any of her
paper off her computer screen?

31:16.718 --> 31:17.853
No.

31:17.887 --> 31:18.888
So...

31:19.521 --> 31:22.324
you don't know that she was
working on my assignment.

31:22.357 --> 31:24.459
She could have been stressed
about anything.

31:24.927 --> 31:26.028
I guess so.

31:26.461 --> 31:28.497
She complained
a lot about her history class

31:28.530 --> 31:31.299
so I just figured that's
what was stressing her out.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.601
What did she complain about?

31:32.634 --> 31:33.903
She said her TA was a dick.

31:36.505 --> 31:38.774
Thank you. You may go.

31:39.407 --> 31:40.509
Wait.

31:42.410 --> 31:45.614
You said April never discussed
her essay with you.

31:46.381 --> 31:47.516
That's right.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.684
So you have no idea
what it's about.

31:49.718 --> 31:50.953
No idea.

31:53.522 --> 31:57.626
Your last name is Nakashima.

31:57.659 --> 31:59.594
That's Japanese, right?

31:59.996 --> 32:02.697
My dad's Japanese.
My mum's from the Prairies.

32:02.731 --> 32:05.067
If your friend was writing
a paper about your heritage,

32:05.101 --> 32:06.568
wouldn't she tell you
about it?

32:06.601 --> 32:08.070
I was born in Saskatchewan.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.973
Ms. Nakashima, why did Japan
surrender in World War II?

32:11.007 --> 32:12.108
What?

32:12.141 --> 32:13.475
The unconditional surrender.

32:13.508 --> 32:14.776
Why did your people give in?

32:14.810 --> 32:16.078
Come on. Think.

32:16.112 --> 32:17.445
Mr. Ward?

32:17.479 --> 32:19.048
Why? Why did they surrender?

32:19.081 --> 32:20.549
Because they got bombed?!

32:20.582 --> 32:21.817
I mean, right?!

32:22.751 --> 32:24.086
According to April's paper,

32:24.120 --> 32:25.487
the real reason

32:25.687 --> 32:27.389
that Japan
surrendered World War II

32:27.622 --> 32:29.825
was because of the neutrality
pact with the Soviets,

32:29.858 --> 32:31.060
not because of the bomb.

32:31.093 --> 32:32.360
So what?

32:32.394 --> 32:33.996
Well, if April wrote this,

32:34.030 --> 32:36.665
then why wouldn't she educate
her Japanese friend

32:36.698 --> 32:39.668
on this bold, new interpretation
of her people's history?

32:40.102 --> 32:42.138
Because she didn't write this.

32:42.171 --> 32:45.507
No, it's because it doesn't
affect her life in any way.

32:46.108 --> 32:47.409
Does it?

32:47.910 --> 32:49.845
I'm in accounting!

32:51.680 --> 32:53.849
Thank you. You may go.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.920
You need a
fucking therapist.

33:03.758 --> 33:05.061
My name is Tim Mistry

33:05.493 --> 33:08.164
and I have taught you in the
Computer Science department

33:08.197 --> 33:10.066
your entire undergrad.

33:10.099 --> 33:12.068
How would you describe
me, as a student?

33:12.101 --> 33:14.736
You've been offered a position
in Silicon Valley.

33:14.769 --> 33:16.671
I think that
speaks for itself.

33:17.173 --> 33:20.910
Uh, April created a pretty
revolutionary

33:20.943 --> 33:24.613
publishing platform
that optimizes insets...

33:24.646 --> 33:25.982
Sorry, can we move on?

33:26.015 --> 33:27.616
She's allowed to be good
at computers.

33:27.649 --> 33:28.918
I'm not contesting that.

33:30.119 --> 33:32.454
Have you ever suspected
me of cheating?

33:32.487 --> 33:34.823
No. Your work's too
original for that.

33:37.894 --> 33:40.897
Are you comparing writing
code to real writing?

33:41.163 --> 33:42.497
Absolutely.

33:42.797 --> 33:44.666
Coding, like any language,

33:44.699 --> 33:47.802
can be composed with elegance,
efficiency and style.

33:48.070 --> 33:50.106
Do you think coding skills
can translate over

33:50.139 --> 33:51.439
to essay-writing skills?

33:51.673 --> 33:52.841
I believe they can.

33:52.874 --> 33:54.409
Great, thank you.

33:55.510 --> 33:56.711
Alright.

34:00.082 --> 34:01.816
Has April's coding
always been good?

34:02.184 --> 34:03.185
Yes.

34:03.785 --> 34:05.854
Since her first
assignment for you?

34:05.888 --> 34:07.156
As I recall, yes.

34:07.489 --> 34:10.592
So if coding skills
translate to writing skills,

34:10.625 --> 34:12.995
the quality of her writing
should be just as consistent

34:13.029 --> 34:14.596
as the quality of her coding.

34:14.862 --> 34:15.965
Is that right?

34:15.998 --> 34:17.699
I guess you could say that.

34:17.732 --> 34:18.900
Well, that's strange.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.569
Because the quality
of her writing

34:21.835 --> 34:24.472
only got better
in the last semester.

34:24.839 --> 34:25.975
How do you explain that?

34:27.109 --> 34:30.578
Perhaps she only started trying
in your classes recently.

34:30.779 --> 34:33.547
And why wouldn't
she try in my classes?

34:33.581 --> 34:34.917
I can't speak for my students.

34:34.951 --> 34:36.551
Well, maybe you should
try harder.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.154
- Excuse me?
- Mr. Ward.

34:38.187 --> 34:39.721
Watch your tone.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.656
Are you aware

34:42.024 --> 34:44.060
that your
students need to take credits

34:44.092 --> 34:46.228
outside of
the Computer Sciences department

34:46.262 --> 34:47.562
in order to graduate?

34:48.130 --> 34:51.233
And that those classes
are generally in the Humanities?

34:51.266 --> 34:52.500
Of course.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.603
The university mandates
a well-rounded education.

34:55.938 --> 34:58.207
Do you think that students
like her

34:58.240 --> 35:00.842
resent having to take
those classes

35:00.875 --> 35:02.777
because they feel
that they are useless?

35:03.312 --> 35:06.182
Again, I don't speak
for my students.

35:06.215 --> 35:08.516
Sure. Sure.

35:09.385 --> 35:13.923
Professor... do you think that
a liberal arts education

35:13.956 --> 35:15.191
is useless?

35:15.623 --> 35:19.028
The liberal arts don't provide
much value to the world.

35:19.527 --> 35:21.796
Certainly not compared
to what we do.

35:22.031 --> 35:24.934
Professor, sorry to interrupt.

35:24.967 --> 35:26.735
Have you worked in
Silicon Valley?

35:26.768 --> 35:28.104
Yes, I have.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.804
You familiar with
the tech culture there?

35:29.838 --> 35:30.872
Very much so.

35:31.273 --> 35:32.942
I wasn't done questioning
the witness.

35:32.975 --> 35:34.776
Do you think April
would get hired

35:34.809 --> 35:36.811
even if she didn't have
a university degree?

35:36.845 --> 35:37.880
What?

35:39.115 --> 35:40.648
Of course she would.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.119
April will get a job...

35:44.120 --> 35:45.553
no matter what.

35:47.123 --> 35:48.656
Without a degree?

35:48.690 --> 35:50.725
Silicon Valley
is run by drop-outs.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.694
At the end of the day,

35:52.727 --> 35:54.330
the credentials a student
earns here?

35:54.363 --> 35:56.564
No substitute for raw talent.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.567
Professor,
one more question.

35:59.601 --> 36:01.836
Why would
a computer science student

36:01.870 --> 36:04.273
bother cheating on
a meaningless history assignment

36:04.306 --> 36:06.841
when she already has
a job waiting for her?

36:08.010 --> 36:09.145
She wouldn't.

36:10.946 --> 36:12.847
Thank you, Professor.

36:18.154 --> 36:19.955
Irene, hello.

36:20.222 --> 36:23.059
<i>Deborah, my office
just received an email</i>

36:23.092 --> 36:26.062
from a reporter
at the DuPont Gazette.

36:26.095 --> 36:27.762
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

36:28.130 --> 36:32.001
<i>He asked for a comment on
an ongoing academic tribunal</i>

36:32.501 --> 36:36.571
racially targeting students
of Asian descent.

36:37.073 --> 36:38.107
What?

36:38.441 --> 36:40.276
<i>Plus, they asked for you
by name,</i>

36:40.309 --> 36:42.610
and your name is
not on the site yet.

36:44.313 --> 36:47.149
<i>I think somebody in that room
is talking to the press.</i>

36:48.716 --> 36:50.019
Your tribunal...

36:50.052 --> 36:52.321
is it, in fact,
an Asian student?

36:53.055 --> 36:54.056
Yes.

36:54.856 --> 36:56.624
If this story comes out

36:56.658 --> 37:01.564
and looks even a little
racially-motivated,

37:02.198 --> 37:04.033
<i>I can't
fathom the consequences.</i>

37:05.000 --> 37:06.302
Should I postpone?

37:06.601 --> 37:08.938
<i>No, no. That'll look
like we're stalling.</i>

37:08.971 --> 37:10.072
<i>Just get the job done</i>

37:10.106 --> 37:11.673
and be careful in there.

37:11.706 --> 37:13.109
People are listening.

37:19.982 --> 37:21.917
You know, your job's
not gonna save you.

37:21.951 --> 37:23.785
Just because you don't need
to pass my class

37:23.818 --> 37:25.121
that doesn't make
you innocent.

37:25.154 --> 37:26.788
You know, there's been
something

37:26.821 --> 37:28.656
I've been wondering all day.

37:29.091 --> 37:32.061
What exactly are you getting
out of all of this?

37:32.094 --> 37:34.696
I'm upholding the integrity
of this school.

37:34.729 --> 37:36.132
What are you
getting out of this?

37:36.165 --> 37:37.699
I want to clear my name.

37:38.234 --> 37:41.070
I'm not gonna let you call me
a cheater in front of everyone,

37:41.103 --> 37:42.637
and get away with it.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.673
You still care what
people think?

37:46.175 --> 37:47.343
You're just...

37:47.610 --> 37:49.677
What do you guys call it,
"saving face"?

37:50.212 --> 37:51.746
That's pathetic.

38:01.257 --> 38:02.892
Hi, Mum.

38:12.902 --> 38:15.070
<i>Okay, Mum.
I'm glad everyone's landed</i>

38:15.104 --> 38:16.871
<i>but I really have to go.</i>

38:16.906 --> 38:18.474
<i>I'm still with my friends
right now, okay?</i>

38:46.202 --> 38:47.903
Mom, I don't care.

38:47.937 --> 38:49.771
<i>For the last time,
I can't talk.</i>

38:49.804 --> 38:51.373
<i>I really have to go
right now, okay?</i>

38:54.009 --> 38:56.912
Darling, you sound not so good.

38:57.213 --> 38:58.746
Is everything okay?

39:01.050 --> 39:03.085
Yeah. Everything's fine.

39:08.224 --> 39:09.391
Yeah.

39:28.544 --> 39:30.446
Okay, well, thank you very much.

39:30.745 --> 39:35.284
Keith, the way you are treating
that girl is unconscionable.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.953
I'm sorry you feel
that way, sir...

39:37.987 --> 39:39.421
Now, I'm going to go back
in there

39:39.455 --> 39:41.323
and I'm gonna withdraw
our complaint

39:41.357 --> 39:43.926
before any more people are
humiliated in your little farce.

39:43.959 --> 39:45.294
Actually...

39:46.428 --> 39:48.464
you don't have
the authority to do that.

39:48.497 --> 39:50.132
It's my class, Keith.

39:50.432 --> 39:53.502
Yes, but... both of our names
are on the complaint,

39:53.535 --> 39:55.371
so we would both need to be
in agreement

39:55.404 --> 39:56.804
for it to be withdrawn.

39:58.307 --> 39:59.841
It'll be over soon.

40:00.242 --> 40:01.310
Promise.

40:08.984 --> 40:11.153
Why are you trying
to drop the case?

40:12.288 --> 40:14.123
This trial's a waste
of our time.

40:15.257 --> 40:17.393
She one of your indiscretions,
Alan?

40:19.128 --> 40:21.263
You did always have
a type in grad school.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.065
Richard...

40:24.366 --> 40:26.035
I'm not gonna
listen to this.

40:33.642 --> 40:35.978
It's come to light
that certain details

40:36.011 --> 40:39.415
about today's hearing have made
their way out of the room.

40:41.984 --> 40:43.552
Therefore, I'm going to need
everyone

40:43.585 --> 40:45.254
to hand over their
phones.

40:47.489 --> 40:49.058
Mr. Bertier?

40:52.928 --> 40:55.030
Would you please collect
everyone's phones?

40:56.332 --> 40:57.499
Uh huh.

41:07.509 --> 41:11.113
Can you tell use your name
and scholarly background?

41:11.647 --> 41:13.949
My name is Elisha Sinclair.

41:13.982 --> 41:16.251
I've completed a PhD
in political science

41:16.285 --> 41:17.953
and my dissertation is entitled

41:17.986 --> 41:20.356
"All Quiet on the Best
Western Front:

41:20.689 --> 41:24.493
Hotel Economies, Black Markets
and Jihadist Financing

41:24.526 --> 41:26.028
in a Global World."

41:26.395 --> 41:29.098
And what is your current
line of work?

41:30.032 --> 41:31.467
I'm an essay writer.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.569
You mean that you write
original essays

41:33.602 --> 41:35.938
that students
pass off as their own?

41:36.939 --> 41:37.973
Yes.

41:38.407 --> 41:40.342
Can you walk us through
your process?

41:40.376 --> 41:41.410
Sure.

41:41.643 --> 41:43.912
Before I start,
I ask my clients

41:43.946 --> 41:45.948
for copies of
their old essays for reference.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.584
So that I can match the writing
quality of their previous work

41:48.617 --> 41:50.219
to prevent arousing suspicion.

41:50.252 --> 41:53.255
And do you take any
other precautions?

41:53.288 --> 41:56.325
Specifically concerning
the digital files.

41:56.658 --> 41:59.294
Yeah, well, as you know,

41:59.528 --> 42:01.597
digital files are required
to be submitted

42:01.630 --> 42:03.332
so that they can be run through

42:03.365 --> 42:05.334
the school's plagiarism
detection software.

42:05.367 --> 42:08.170
But what people don't know,

42:08.203 --> 42:10.606
is that each digital file
carries with it

42:10.639 --> 42:13.308
an invisible signature
of the author in its metadata.

42:13.642 --> 42:15.644
So, to make sure my clients
don't get caught,

42:15.677 --> 42:18.113
I wipe that metadata
before I hand the files over.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.417
And if you didn't erase
the metadata?

42:21.650 --> 42:25.521
Then it would show the name
of the true author of the essay.

42:29.358 --> 42:31.026
Here is the metadata

42:31.794 --> 42:34.596
for the three essays April
has submitted to me.

42:34.997 --> 42:39.234
As you can see, her name
appears on the first two.

42:39.535 --> 42:41.236
But with the third essay,

42:41.270 --> 42:43.005
the one we are discussing
here today,

42:43.372 --> 42:45.340
the metadata appears blank.

42:46.175 --> 42:48.043
As if someone's erased it.

42:50.412 --> 42:52.614
I recently scrubbed
my personal information

42:52.648 --> 42:55.083
from my computer
for privacy reasons.

43:00.255 --> 43:03.492
Well, I think the files
speak for themselves.

43:15.337 --> 43:17.506
Okay, then, I'm gonna go.

43:19.274 --> 43:20.609
Why do you do this?

43:22.578 --> 43:23.679
Pardon me?

43:24.046 --> 43:26.181
Why do you help
students cheat?

43:26.215 --> 43:27.516
Do you just need the money?

43:28.517 --> 43:31.587
No, I don't need the money.

43:33.222 --> 43:37.159
I help students cheat because
you cheat them.

43:37.626 --> 43:40.395
We're both shilling overpriced
pieces of paper

43:40.429 --> 43:42.531
to kids too dumb
to know any better.

43:43.232 --> 43:46.235
Yours just happens to say
"diploma" at the top.

43:59.114 --> 44:01.149
I'd like to question
Professor Thornton.

44:01.783 --> 44:03.318
- What?
- Wha...?

44:03.719 --> 44:06.321
No, no. I didn't even
mark the damn thing.

44:06.355 --> 44:08.524
Unfortunately, I don't have
the authority

44:08.557 --> 44:10.626
to force Professor
Thornton to be questioned.

44:10.659 --> 44:13.529
Just like I can't force you to
be questioned either, Ms. Chen.

44:13.562 --> 44:15.464
- Oh, I don't mind!
- Whoa! No, wait.

44:15.497 --> 44:17.065
I can't let the happen.

44:17.432 --> 44:19.768
I bet you'd like to ask me
some questions, wouldn't you?

44:19.801 --> 44:22.404
- You ready to testify?
- Absolutely not.

44:22.437 --> 44:23.605
I have nothing to hide.

44:23.639 --> 44:25.407
I need a moment with my client.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.708
Go.

44:31.813 --> 44:33.148
Water?

44:33.181 --> 44:34.449
Please.

44:41.423 --> 44:43.325
I am not letting you do this.

44:43.358 --> 44:44.760
You're the accused.

44:44.793 --> 44:47.129
You're not supposed
to be testifying.

44:47.162 --> 44:48.697
Do you think anyone
in there cares

44:48.730 --> 44:50.599
about how things
are supposed to go?

44:50.632 --> 44:52.234
I can handle myself.

44:52.267 --> 44:54.369
He's not
as smart as he thinks he is.

44:54.403 --> 44:56.371
Neither are you! No!

44:56.405 --> 45:00.509
No way. If you go up there,
I will leave in protest.

45:00.542 --> 45:02.177
Is that what you want?

45:02.210 --> 45:04.446
No, I don't want you
to leave in protest.

45:04.479 --> 45:05.547
Okay, then.

45:05.847 --> 45:07.683
You should leave because
you're fired.

45:08.450 --> 45:10.419
You can't fire me.

45:10.452 --> 45:13.455
What are you gonna do?
Represent me against my will?

45:13.789 --> 45:16.124
Is that how things are
supposed to work?

45:16.893 --> 45:19.394
Go home.

45:27.502 --> 45:29.705
Keith, I need you to trust
me on this, okay?

45:29.738 --> 45:31.840
I will not be questioned
by that girl.

45:31.873 --> 45:33.375
Sir, with all due respect,

45:33.609 --> 45:35.477
I don't understand why
you won't testify...

45:35.510 --> 45:37.312
Because, Keith!

45:39.348 --> 45:41.383
<i>Look, something happened
that day</i>

45:41.416 --> 45:42.784
<i>when she came to my office.</i>

45:46.889 --> 45:48.357
What happened?

46:04.806 --> 46:05.874
Hm.

46:06.775 --> 46:09.311
I've never seen that
other essay before.

46:15.317 --> 46:16.718
Where's your family from, April?

46:18.487 --> 46:19.755
They're from Harbin.

46:20.023 --> 46:22.724
Harbin? You ever to been
to the ice festival?

46:24.226 --> 46:26.261
Yeah. As a kid.

46:26.528 --> 46:29.831
I went there a few years back.
It was breathtaking.

46:33.535 --> 46:35.337
Why don't I make you a
deal?

46:35.771 --> 46:37.606
How about to make up for this,

46:37.639 --> 46:39.608
you come and take one
of my summer courses

46:39.641 --> 46:40.943
and you'll get
the same credit?

46:40.977 --> 46:42.711
Classes are much more relaxed.

46:42.979 --> 46:45.247
It's basically just hangin' out.

46:46.848 --> 46:49.685
I'm actually planning to go
visit my family this summer.

46:50.252 --> 46:51.453
So...

46:53.422 --> 46:55.557
Do you have any photos
from Harbin?

46:56.893 --> 46:57.927
Sure.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.661
Um...

47:02.264 --> 47:04.266
- Yeah, this is Zhaolin Park.
- Hm.

47:05.767 --> 47:07.469
- Pretty windy that day.
- Uh huh.

47:07.669 --> 47:09.871
Kid just ran up
and photo-bombed me.

47:14.276 --> 47:16.578
Oh, you'll have to give me
advice on where to go.

47:16.611 --> 47:17.679
Absolutely.

47:18.246 --> 47:20.649
Here. I'm gonna text myself
so you have my number.

47:21.017 --> 47:22.317
Sure.

47:26.788 --> 47:28.490
- There.
- Thanks.

47:32.028 --> 47:34.663
Now, getting back to
the matter at hand here.

47:34.964 --> 47:36.331
When you look at these,

47:36.665 --> 47:38.500
do you see why
I had to bring you in here?

47:39.035 --> 47:40.970
Yeah, I think I do.

47:41.003 --> 47:42.804
I mean, it seems
innocent enough.

47:42.838 --> 47:45.007
With these kinds of mistakes,

47:45.041 --> 47:46.575
sometimes you're not even aware

47:46.943 --> 47:49.045
that what you're doing is wrong
even as you're during it.

47:49.078 --> 47:50.812
- You know what I mean?
- Uh huh.

47:52.347 --> 47:53.448
That's me.

48:03.759 --> 48:05.494
Why would you write this?

48:17.572 --> 48:20.042
Okay, I think I can see a way
to mark this as-is

48:20.076 --> 48:23.012
and not take
this situation any further.

48:24.513 --> 48:26.983
After all, this is just
a one-off, right?

48:27.649 --> 48:29.651
- Won't happen again.
- Good.

48:31.353 --> 48:33.288
I'm glad we understand
each other.

48:35.857 --> 48:37.459
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

48:37.492 --> 48:38.593
It's your word
against hers.

48:38.627 --> 48:39.661
So they can't...

48:40.029 --> 48:41.596
If she shows
that text to anyone,

48:41.630 --> 48:42.999
there's gonna be an inquiry.

48:43.032 --> 48:44.499
It'll be a witch-hunt
like at Concordia

48:44.533 --> 48:45.902
and I will
not be crucified...

48:46.102 --> 48:47.869
No, it won't because there
were multiple women

48:47.904 --> 48:49.371
at Concordia...

48:53.441 --> 48:54.476
How many others?

48:54.509 --> 48:55.610
Oh, grow up.

48:55.811 --> 48:57.379
They were all adults.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.915
They know
what they were doing, okay?

48:59.148 --> 49:02.051
At least tell me
they weren't all Asian.

49:03.618 --> 49:05.054
Fuck!

49:06.923 --> 49:08.723
<i>You're gonna be buried
for this.</i>

49:09.591 --> 49:11.793
<i>They're gonna bury you,
too.</i>

49:14.396 --> 49:15.831
I'm sorry, Keith.

49:16.798 --> 49:18.466
You're sorry?

49:19.235 --> 49:21.837
I won't be able to get another
supervisor after this.

49:21.870 --> 49:24.040
I won't be able to
finish my thesis.

49:24.073 --> 49:27.043
Which means that my entire
time here was worthless!

49:27.076 --> 49:31.446
Look, drop the case and you
don't have to worry about it.

49:32.848 --> 49:34.382
Drop the case.

49:39.922 --> 49:40.957
No.

49:42.624 --> 49:44.994
If we cover this up that makes
us just as bad as her.

49:45.027 --> 49:46.561
I'm not like her.

49:47.930 --> 49:49.564
And I'm not like you.

49:54.003 --> 49:55.370
I'll be fired.

49:56.805 --> 49:58.406
You're finished either way.

49:58.807 --> 50:00.609
I'm removing you
as my supervisor

50:00.642 --> 50:02.410
and I'm going
to the department myself

50:02.444 --> 50:04.379
to tell them
about your indiscretions.

50:04.579 --> 50:05.747
Why would you do that?

50:05.982 --> 50:08.017
Because you don't deserve
what you have.

50:10.785 --> 50:12.821
I'll give you a chance
to retire on Monday.

50:13.189 --> 50:14.756
But if you don't quit by then,

50:14.789 --> 50:16.092
I have no choice
but to report you.

50:16.125 --> 50:17.726
You're destroying your life.

50:19.028 --> 50:21.830
No, Alan. You already did that.

50:22.831 --> 50:23.865
Keith...

50:24.399 --> 50:25.767
<i>Keith, wait!</i>

50:32.741 --> 50:34.043
Alan...

50:35.510 --> 50:37.412
- What?
- I, uh...

50:39.916 --> 50:40.950
You know what?

50:41.217 --> 50:42.651
I'm done with this place.

50:42.684 --> 50:43.852
You win, Richard.

50:43.886 --> 50:45.520
You feel good about yourself?

50:46.188 --> 50:48.690
I can't say I feel
much of anything right now.

50:50.825 --> 50:51.860
I...

50:54.496 --> 50:57.732
I wanna say that I forgive you
for what you did to me.

50:59.668 --> 51:00.937
You forgive me?

51:02.905 --> 51:04.873
Oh. That's big of you.

51:06.508 --> 51:08.210
Do you know what, Richard?

51:10.845 --> 51:13.782
I don't want your forgiveness,
you fucking pompous prick.

51:16.685 --> 51:19.221
Do you know why I sent
that letter? Hm?

51:19.922 --> 51:22.524
Because you're an embarrassment
to our field.

51:22.791 --> 51:26.461
And you do not deserve
to be called my peer!

51:29.265 --> 51:30.699
Alan...

51:32.034 --> 51:33.668
Take care of yourself.

51:48.985 --> 51:51.253
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Ms. Lewis.</i>

51:51.287 --> 51:53.189
<i>My name is Peter Hanson</i>

51:53.222 --> 51:55.623
<i>and I'm the VP
and Provost of DuPont.</i>

51:56.292 --> 51:57.960
One moment, please.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.640
Hi, sorry about that.

52:12.674 --> 52:14.310
I'm in the middle of a tribunal.

52:14.343 --> 52:16.845
Have you spoken with Irene?

52:16.879 --> 52:19.614
<i>Actually, Ms. McDonnell
has been placed on leave.</i>

52:19.848 --> 52:22.218
You'll be liaising
with me from now on.

52:23.785 --> 52:26.654
<i>We're working on trying
to get ahead of this story</i>

52:27.123 --> 52:29.125
and we need
your assistance.

52:31.093 --> 52:32.527
Am I gonna be fired?

52:32.895 --> 52:35.264
<i>If you can ensure
that the final verdict</i>

52:35.297 --> 52:37.632
won't be, uh, problematic

52:38.200 --> 52:41.937
<i>that would be helpful
to both the university</i>

52:42.871 --> 52:44.106
and to yourself.

52:45.807 --> 52:47.642
<i>Do you understand?</i>

52:51.080 --> 52:52.114
Hey!

52:52.814 --> 52:54.150
What, man?

52:54.682 --> 52:56.684
What, are you leaving?
What's going on?

52:56.986 --> 52:58.954
She fired me.

52:59.188 --> 53:00.722
Fuck!

53:00.755 --> 53:02.091
Can she even do that?

53:02.124 --> 53:03.292
She's out of control

53:03.691 --> 53:05.760
and I can't protect her
from herself any more.

53:05.794 --> 53:08.197
You need to look out
for her in there.

53:09.265 --> 53:10.299
Me?

53:10.332 --> 53:11.566
Yeah.

53:11.766 --> 53:13.235
Well, what am I supposed to do?

53:14.702 --> 53:16.272
It's not that complicated.

53:35.091 --> 53:36.325
Where's Mr. Shaw?

53:37.226 --> 53:38.294
He's gone.

53:38.494 --> 53:39.895
Gone?

53:40.362 --> 53:42.231
And where's
Professor Thornton?

53:42.264 --> 53:44.133
He won't be
joining us but...

53:45.267 --> 53:47.036
I'm willing
to testify in his place

53:47.069 --> 53:49.804
if April's still
willing to honour our deal.

53:54.410 --> 53:57.079
Yeah. Okay.

53:58.680 --> 53:59.915
You know what?

54:00.382 --> 54:03.052
Okay, fine. Let's finish this.

54:14.130 --> 54:15.797
- So...
- Keith Ward.

54:16.232 --> 54:18.033
Poli sci PhD student.

54:18.067 --> 54:20.702
Working title of my
thesis is "Chasing Anarchy:

54:20.735 --> 54:22.737
Understanding Subaltern
Praxiography

54:22.770 --> 54:24.406
- in the Spanish Civil War"...
- Keith.

54:25.307 --> 54:28.244
How many students have you
taken to an academic tribunal?

54:28.477 --> 54:29.879
You're the first.

54:30.379 --> 54:32.982
So you've never suspected
anyone else of cheating before.

54:33.015 --> 54:34.782
Well, I have but
they all confessed

54:34.816 --> 54:36.185
when I confronted them.

54:36.519 --> 54:37.752
Were they punished?

54:37.785 --> 54:38.820
Of course.

54:39.088 --> 54:40.822
Re-writes,
grade reductions...

54:40.855 --> 54:42.124
Did you fail them?

54:43.092 --> 54:44.126
No.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.028
Deny them their degree?

54:47.062 --> 54:48.097
No.

54:48.397 --> 54:49.899
Yet you are
trying to do

54:49.932 --> 54:51.066
both those things to me.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.434
Why?

54:53.402 --> 54:56.305
Because I've never met
a student as deceitful as you.

54:56.838 --> 54:57.872
Oh.

54:59.074 --> 55:01.010
You must not like me very much.

55:01.043 --> 55:04.079
I like all my students...
as long as they're honest.

55:04.513 --> 55:07.815
Is there something about me,
specifically,

55:08.150 --> 55:10.419
that makes you
think I'm not an honest person?

55:13.022 --> 55:14.056
Yes.

55:15.757 --> 55:16.791
What?

55:19.161 --> 55:20.996
It was your lack of remorse.

55:22.965 --> 55:23.999
What do you mean?

55:26.202 --> 55:28.204
When you were first caught
for cheating...

55:28.537 --> 55:32.975
<i>I let you off
and you just took it and left.</i>

55:33.775 --> 55:35.843
<i>You weren't even sorry
for what you did.</i>

55:36.045 --> 55:37.880
And I knew you'd try
and cheat again.

55:37.913 --> 55:39.215
You have no respect.

55:40.516 --> 55:42.017
No gratitude.

55:44.019 --> 55:46.788
So that's why you dragged
all of us here today.

55:49.091 --> 55:50.159
Well...

55:51.994 --> 55:53.262
Mr. Ward...

55:54.129 --> 55:57.700
let me just take this
opportunity to say that...

55:58.334 --> 55:59.834
I'm so sorry

56:00.069 --> 56:03.272
that two years ago
I forgot to say

56:03.305 --> 56:04.739
I'm so sorry.

56:11.080 --> 56:12.381
Are you finished?

56:20.522 --> 56:23.825
Do you resent being forced
to take my classes?

56:24.393 --> 56:26.929
Well, I don't think I should
have to pay for them.

56:27.329 --> 56:28.497
Why not?

56:29.164 --> 56:32.034
Because I didn't come here
to learn how to write papers

56:32.067 --> 56:33.768
no one will ever read.

56:34.336 --> 56:36.005
Then why did you come here?

56:36.639 --> 56:40.075
To build stuff.
That's what people like me do.

56:40.109 --> 56:41.776
We go out and build the world

56:41.977 --> 56:44.280
while people like you just sit
around and discuss it.

56:46.015 --> 56:47.815
Do you hate me, April?

56:49.285 --> 56:51.520
You're not
interesting enough to hate.

56:52.621 --> 56:53.855
Hm.

56:54.957 --> 56:58.961
Now, you don't need a degree

56:58.994 --> 57:00.996
in order to be employed
in your field.

57:01.263 --> 57:02.364
Is that correct?

57:02.698 --> 57:04.133
That's what I'm told.

57:05.601 --> 57:07.369
Then I guess that begs
the question,

57:07.636 --> 57:10.105
why even bother cheating
in the first place?

57:11.273 --> 57:12.308
But...

57:13.575 --> 57:16.278
what if, even though you
don't need a degree,

57:17.046 --> 57:19.415
you desperately do need
to graduate?

57:30.659 --> 57:33.996
Do have any guests attending
the graduation ceremony?

57:34.663 --> 57:36.131
Anyone flying in?

57:39.268 --> 57:40.402
Some family.

57:42.104 --> 57:43.339
Some family?

57:45.641 --> 57:48.210
See, I called the head
of the grad committee

57:48.243 --> 57:53.148
<i>and they said you have 12 seats
reserved for your family.</i>

57:53.482 --> 57:54.983
Thank you very much.

57:55.651 --> 57:56.851
Twelve.

57:58.654 --> 58:01.190
And they've come from quite
a ways away, haven't they?

58:02.658 --> 58:05.094
How embarrassing would it be

58:05.127 --> 58:07.229
for you to have to explain
to them

58:07.262 --> 58:10.232
that they flew all the way here
for nothing?

58:12.701 --> 58:13.969
Admit it.

58:14.370 --> 58:16.505
You're only here covering up
for cheating

58:16.538 --> 58:19.308
because you can't
bear to face your family

58:19.341 --> 58:22.311
and tell them that you won't
part of that ceremony.

58:23.645 --> 58:27.182
How hard have they worked
to send you here?

58:27.416 --> 58:29.618
What have they sacrificed
for you, huh, April?

58:30.285 --> 58:32.354
What would they say
if they knew

58:32.388 --> 58:34.957
that their daughter
was a lying, cheating...

58:34.990 --> 58:36.325
I am not a...

58:36.358 --> 58:37.993
Because the truth is

58:38.026 --> 58:39.695
that you don't respect me
or my classes.

58:39.728 --> 58:41.363
And you loathe the fact

58:41.397 --> 58:43.132
the someone like me
would come in here

58:43.165 --> 58:45.100
and shame you
in front of your entire family!

58:45.134 --> 58:46.235
Isn't that right, April?!

58:46.268 --> 58:48.070
Yes! Yes!

58:48.103 --> 58:50.472
I hate your classes
and I hate you

58:50.506 --> 58:52.975
and this entire
fucking school!

58:53.008 --> 58:54.643
- Which is why I...
- Cheated.

58:54.676 --> 58:56.211
Say you plagiarized
the essay.

58:56.245 --> 58:57.479
- Say it, April.
- You...!

59:21.370 --> 59:22.538
Pfft.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.182
You're wrong.

59:34.716 --> 59:36.218
I'm not a cheater.

59:39.755 --> 59:41.523
Please give us
the room.

59:52.501 --> 59:55.204
Okay, so...

59:56.572 --> 59:58.240
how do you think
we should proceed?

59:59.241 --> 01:00:00.409
Professor Gould?

01:00:00.776 --> 01:00:02.578
I could care less
how we proceed.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.148
Ms. Lewis?

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.084
What do you think?

01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:10.452
What do I think?

01:00:10.887 --> 01:00:13.021
We're fucked, is what I think.

01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:18.093
There's a story coming out
about today.

01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:20.462
About this.

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:21.530
What?

01:00:22.598 --> 01:00:24.233
How do you know that?

01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:26.101
Because my fucking boss
just got fired,

01:00:26.134 --> 01:00:27.169
that's how I know.

01:00:27.202 --> 01:00:28.470
And guess who's next?

01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:32.441
I can't believe
she would do this to us.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:36.211
Wait, you think April
leaked the story?

01:00:36.512 --> 01:00:37.713
Who else would it be?

01:00:39.648 --> 01:00:40.782
Oh, ho, ho...

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.256
If she's trying
to manipulate us

01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:48.724
she needs to be held
accountable.

01:00:48.757 --> 01:00:49.791
It's too late.

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:51.760
The story's already out.

01:00:52.794 --> 01:00:54.062
We have to let her go.

01:00:54.096 --> 01:00:55.197
And what if we fail her?

01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:57.599
Then we'll end up looking
as prejudiced

01:00:57.633 --> 01:00:59.268
as the American schools.

01:00:59.835 --> 01:01:03.205
The university will be publicly
shamed and I'll be fired.

01:01:03.238 --> 01:01:06.542
Deborah, this is nothing
short of extortion.

01:01:06.808 --> 01:01:08.577
She is deliberately
preventing us

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.445
from fulfilling our duty
as arbiters...

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:12.514
Richard! Let's be honest.

01:01:13.382 --> 01:01:17.686
Our duty today was nothing more
than offering customer support.

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.590
There's only one thing to do.

01:01:22.357 --> 01:01:24.192
So, should I bring
them in?

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:25.294
No.

01:01:25.827 --> 01:01:27.529
I'm not just gonna
let this happen.

01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:29.264
Nothing you do will
make a difference...

01:01:29.298 --> 01:01:31.633
I don't care. I will not
be cornered like this.

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:34.169
And I'm gonna tell her that.
Screw the university.

01:01:34.536 --> 01:01:35.604
Stop!

01:01:36.538 --> 01:01:37.606
Stop.

01:01:39.841 --> 01:01:41.476
Okay, it was... it was me.

01:01:42.277 --> 01:01:43.579
Excuse me?

01:01:45.882 --> 01:01:47.783
I'm the one leaking the hearing.

01:01:48.317 --> 01:01:49.351
You?

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:50.619
Yeah.

01:01:52.554 --> 01:01:53.622
I'm sorry.

01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:57.326
Did you say leaking?

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.129
Does that mean that someone
is listening right now?

01:02:01.898 --> 01:02:03.565
It wasn't supposed
to get this far!

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.168
And then nobody was supposed
to get fired.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:10.172
I screwed this whole
thing up.

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:14.610
You...

01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:16.812
- Whoa!
- Hey!

01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:29.524
You know, I get why
you did this.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:32.828
And I get why
you had to do this.

01:02:33.228 --> 01:02:34.730
Family's important.

01:02:37.432 --> 01:02:39.735
You don't know anything
about my family.

01:02:39.768 --> 01:02:41.737
I know they came here
to celebrate you.

01:02:42.371 --> 01:02:45.707
Or, more importantly,
all your successes.

01:02:47.843 --> 01:02:50.345
That's what this is
all about, right?

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:54.316
I mean, if it wasn't
for all your accomplishments,

01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:56.818
what would you even be
to your parents?

01:02:58.087 --> 01:03:01.289
You think that they'd probably
just disown you at that point?

01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.493
Boy, that must be hard.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.898
Going your whole life
knowing that your family's love

01:03:08.931 --> 01:03:11.366
is ultimately just...

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.201
conditional.

01:03:19.008 --> 01:03:21.176
What do you think is gonna
happen to you...

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:23.278
when this is all over?

01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:27.683
What are you supposed to
do with yourself now?

01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:31.420
Do you have a life?

01:03:33.255 --> 01:03:34.256
Huh?

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:38.760
I mean, who even are you
without this place?

01:03:39.394 --> 01:03:42.197
You wanna know
what I think?

01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:47.669
I think you're just
gonna disappear.

01:03:49.404 --> 01:03:51.873
Because if there's one thing
I know about you,

01:03:51.908 --> 01:03:54.276
it's this: there...

01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:55.777
Shut up!

01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:06.254
There.

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:09.224
That's who
you really are.

01:04:36.818 --> 01:04:39.688
<i>After careful
consideration of the evidence</i>

01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:41.723
<i>brought forth by both parties</i>

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:45.794
<i>concerning April Chen's final
International History 300 essay,</i>

01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:49.966
<i>this academic tribunal
has unanimously found</i>

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:52.300
<i>that there was no sufficient
evidence</i>

01:04:52.334 --> 01:04:55.470
<i>to suggest that an academic
offence has been committed</i>

01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:57.672
<i>by the student, April Chen.</i>

01:04:59.775 --> 01:05:02.711
<i>Therefore, the grade given
on the essay will stand</i>

01:05:02.744 --> 01:05:06.648
<i>and she will be awarded
her degree in Computer Science.</i>

01:05:11.553 --> 01:05:13.522
<i>On behalf of DuPont University,</i>

01:05:13.555 --> 01:05:16.291
<i>I would like to thank everyone
for coming in today.</i>

01:05:17.592 --> 01:05:19.594
<i>Our decision is final</i>

01:05:19.628 --> 01:05:23.598
<i>and the university considers
this matter closed.</i>

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:27.829
Hello?

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:29.098
<i>So, a deal's a deal.</i>

01:06:29.131 --> 01:06:30.632
<i>Right, April?</i>

01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:41.710
Hey.

01:06:43.712 --> 01:06:44.981
You okay?

01:06:45.281 --> 01:06:46.781
Yeah, I'm good.

01:06:47.016 --> 01:06:48.617
So what's up?

01:06:49.085 --> 01:06:50.518
I need a favour.

01:06:50.887 --> 01:06:51.988
Again?

01:06:52.021 --> 01:06:53.688
I need you to write a story

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:55.523
about DuPont's plagiarism
tribunals

01:06:55.557 --> 01:06:57.425
targeting Asian students.

01:06:57.459 --> 01:06:58.660
You got caught, didn't you?

01:06:58.928 --> 01:07:00.930
You can start by finding
the Comp Sci rep.

01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:02.530
His name's Josh Bertier.

01:07:02.564 --> 01:07:03.798
Yeah, I know Josh.

01:07:04.367 --> 01:07:05.734
What do I get out of this?

01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:07.904
You know I built a platform
that was bought

01:07:07.937 --> 01:07:09.604
by Snakeskin
Media Group, right?

01:07:09.638 --> 01:07:11.207
Does this mean you can get me
an interview

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.574
at one of their sites?

01:07:12.807 --> 01:07:14.709
I can get you a full-time
writing position

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:16.012
in their New York bureau.

01:07:16.045 --> 01:07:17.079
New York?!

01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:20.682
Shit!

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:44.082
