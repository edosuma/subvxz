04:08.408 --> 04:10.508
Found another one today.

04:11.808 --> 04:15.626
- Young heifer.
- Where?

04:15.907 --> 04:18.201
Out by the property line.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.879
<i>Throat slit
from ear to ear.</i>

04:22.307 --> 04:23.836
Third one this month.

04:25.006 --> 04:27.844
I think it's them kids
over at Luke's place.

04:29.006 --> 04:31.977
Now, why would they do
something like that?

04:40.605 --> 04:43.105
That's not the storm.

04:43.205 --> 04:45.105
That's somethin' else.

04:49.504 --> 04:51.598
<i>There's somethin'
goin' on out there.</i>

04:52.604 --> 04:55.604
I'm gonna check it out.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.901
What are you doin' here?

05:29.001 --> 05:32.000
That cornfield belongs to us.

06:37.194 --> 06:41.194
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

06:54.793 --> 06:56.859
Oh, Lazlo,
that is so disgusting.

06:57.192 --> 07:00.392
What are you talking about?
She is so fine!

07:00.492 --> 07:02.493
She takes care of me.
Not like you.

07:02.593 --> 07:03.437
You take care of me?

07:03.438 --> 07:05.783
I'm just telling you!
I'll take care of you!

07:20.293 --> 07:22.994
Yeah!

07:23.094 --> 07:24.994
Look at her!

07:27.294 --> 07:29.194
Pointing the wrong way.

07:29.294 --> 07:31.494
Yeah?

07:31.594 --> 07:33.494
There we go.
How's that?

07:33.594 --> 07:36.194
- Perfect.
- No.

07:36.295 --> 07:38.395
I'm sorry, baby.

07:38.495 --> 07:41.494
It's... It's just not gonna
work out between you and me.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.195
- You being vinyl, me being a man...
- You're pathetic.

07:44.295 --> 07:48.695
<i>- Flesh and blood.
- Let's go.</i>

07:50.995 --> 07:53.095
Hey, Tyrus,
you remember the man of the hour?

07:53.195 --> 07:56.695
- Got 'im right here.
- Hey, buddy!

07:56.795 --> 07:59.196
Get it away from me!
I don't want to look at that.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.795
<i>Guys, don't spill Kurt
in my car.</i>

08:01.895 --> 08:03.995
- I don't want to look at that.
- God, I'm sorry!

08:04.095 --> 08:07.396
- I just forgot
you were the grieving widow.
- Shut up!

08:07.496 --> 08:09.396
And we weren't married.

08:09.496 --> 08:11.496
We just talked
about it sometimes.

08:11.596 --> 08:13.696
<i>Well, Kurt talked
about a lot of things.</i>

08:13.796 --> 08:15.696
<i>Yeah, like what a jerk you are.</i>

08:15.796 --> 08:18.496
Come on, you guys, cool it. We're
the closest thing Kurt had to family,

08:18.596 --> 08:21.997
- so let's try and have
a little respect for the dead.
- Exactly.

08:22.097 --> 08:25.496
<i>Hey, I think that's one
of Lazlo's dolls.</i>

08:50.598 --> 08:52.498
Hold on a second.

09:01.899 --> 09:04.199
Hey, maybe you
shouldn't do that.

09:05.299 --> 09:07.198
Hell, no.

09:07.298 --> 09:10.299
This is the heartland of America, where
people invite you into their homes...

09:10.399 --> 09:13.799
to talk about tornados,
droughts, floods,

09:13.899 --> 09:17.799
<i>Grandma's moonshine,
shotgun weddings,</i>

09:17.899 --> 09:23.100
<i>they introduce you to their
buxom, virginal daughters,</i>

09:23.200 --> 09:25.100
and where...

09:27.799 --> 09:30.300
where people disappear.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.300
Charlotte?

10:00.002 --> 10:01.901
Charlotte?

10:13.402 --> 10:15.802
Hello?

10:15.902 --> 10:18.302
<i>Lazlo?</i>

11:45.407 --> 11:47.507
No!

11:49.606 --> 11:52.707
Charlotte!

12:12.307 --> 12:14.608
<i>Jared!</i>

12:17.108 --> 12:19.008
<i>Come here.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:25.008
What have you done?

12:25.108 --> 12:27.709
What if she's not alone?

12:27.809 --> 12:29.809
Did you ever think of that?

12:35.609 --> 12:38.409
Don't let him
get back to the road.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.510
That way.

13:13.111 --> 13:15.011
That doesn't look right.

13:28.711 --> 13:30.611
Man!

13:30.711 --> 13:32.612
You took
a wrong turn, man.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.612
You saw the doll.
It was pointed this way.

13:34.712 --> 13:37.112
Well, you know what? You just
should have stayed on the highway.

13:37.212 --> 13:39.412
Yeah? You got a problem
with my driving?

13:55.613 --> 13:57.513
Oh!

14:00.113 --> 14:02.913
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

14:03.013 --> 14:06.613
Ow! God! Great!
This is good!

14:08.914 --> 14:11.113
Oh, my God!

14:11.213 --> 14:13.613
Oh, my God, you guys!
Kurt's all over me!

14:18.014 --> 14:20.114
What the hell
is that thing?

14:20.214 --> 14:22.114
It's one of Lazlo's dolls.

14:22.214 --> 14:24.214
You know what?
We're gonna need a tow truck.

14:26.214 --> 14:28.514
Do you think so, Ty?

14:28.615 --> 14:31.614
<i>You know, that'd be a great idea,
if it wasn't so totally obvious!</i>

14:31.714 --> 14:34.114
You know what?
I do have a problem with your driving.

14:34.214 --> 14:36.915
- What's that?
- The crashing part.

14:37.015 --> 14:38.915
- Crashing part.
- You guys, you guys.

14:39.015 --> 14:41.115
Do you guys smell
something funny... weird?

14:41.215 --> 14:43.215
Did you...

14:43.315 --> 14:46.715
<i>- What is that?
- It's none of your business.</i>

14:51.616 --> 14:54.815
Hi.
What's your name?

15:05.316 --> 15:10.016
Um, we had
a little accident.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.117
You're on private property.

15:12.217 --> 15:16.116
Why don't you run along
and give us a little privacy, then?

15:20.317 --> 15:23.317
- That's a joke, kid.
- Shut up, Greg.

15:23.417 --> 15:27.417
<i>- Could we possibly use a phone?
- We don't have a phone.</i>

15:30.017 --> 15:32.117
Well, h-how about a tractor,
or something,

15:32.217 --> 15:34.518
you know,
to pull us out?

15:34.718 --> 15:37.417
Town's about a mile
that way.

15:56.119 --> 15:58.618
Thanks...

15:58.718 --> 16:00.818
for nothin',
you little punk.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.819
Man, what the hell
was that about?

16:02.919 --> 16:05.919
<i>I don't know.
Those kids give me the creeps, though.</i>

16:06.019 --> 16:08.520
All right, you guys, why don't we
get our stuff out of the car...

16:08.620 --> 16:10.719
and see what's
in town, okay?

16:18.720 --> 16:21.619
Ugh.

16:21.719 --> 16:26.920
Geez, you'd think there'd at least be
a 7-11 at the end of the Earth.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.520
- I think I've found the spot.
- Huh?

16:38.221 --> 16:41.321
- Kurt's favorite dive.
- That must be the place.

16:41.421 --> 16:44.321
We can have final closure
over a cold beer.

16:57.221 --> 17:00.122
You guys, move.
I have to wash up.

17:00.222 --> 17:02.422
Where are they?
They left an hour before we did.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.421
I'm gonna go call Lazlo...

17:04.521 --> 17:07.122
<i>and leave a message
on his machine.</i>

17:11.321 --> 17:14.422
Hey, buddy,
you got any of that...

17:14.521 --> 17:16.922
<i>Millwood Pale Ale?</i>

17:17.021 --> 17:20.823
- Make it two.
- Um, we had a little accident
just outside of town.

17:20.923 --> 17:22.823
- Is there a tow truck service?
- Nope.

17:23.022 --> 17:27.423
It's out of commission. It's over
at Quad's Garage, gettin' a rebuild.

17:27.522 --> 17:30.023
Oh. Um, thanks.

17:30.123 --> 17:32.323
We're also looking for
some friends in a convertible.

17:32.423 --> 17:34.924
They were supposed
to meet us here.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.123
We don't get a whole lot
of tourists in here.

17:37.223 --> 17:43.024
Oh, well, that's probably on account
of your town's little hygiene problem.

17:43.124 --> 17:46.324
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Greg, come on.

17:46.424 --> 17:48.724
Your town stinks.

17:50.724 --> 17:53.224
No, I'm... Seriously.

17:53.324 --> 17:56.125
I mean, there's a foul stench
in the air. You can't smell it?

17:56.225 --> 18:00.024
I don't smell anything.

18:00.124 --> 18:03.325
<i>- Yeah, it smells like burnt popcorn.
- You must be talking about...</i>

18:03.425 --> 18:05.325
the corn silo
at Enright's place.

18:05.425 --> 18:07.425
Been burnin' that way
for some time.

18:07.525 --> 18:09.725
You mean it's on fire?

18:09.825 --> 18:12.325
Spontaneous combustion.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.125
Gases build up,
and then... boom.

18:15.225 --> 18:18.026
Fire like that
can go on for months.

18:18.126 --> 18:20.625
<i>Lucas Enright's
kind of a queer duck.</i>

18:20.725 --> 18:23.326
Keeps to himself, mostly.

18:23.426 --> 18:26.426
He's kind of like Howard Hughes,
except without the money.

18:30.726 --> 18:34.226
Has a bunch of adopted kids
workin' the farm for him.

18:34.326 --> 18:36.226
They're all religious fanatics.

18:36.326 --> 18:38.227
They worship some fella
they call...

18:38.327 --> 18:42.626
<i>He Who Walks Beyond the Clouds,
or somethin'like that.</i>

18:46.127 --> 18:48.627
Wait a minute.

18:48.727 --> 18:52.227
You mean, "He Who Walks
Behind the Rows"?

18:52.327 --> 18:56.427
Yeah! That's it.
What a nutty bunch of fruitcakes.

18:58.127 --> 19:00.628
What'd we miss?

19:00.728 --> 19:02.628
Nothing. Let's go.

19:04.827 --> 19:09.128
What's the rush?
I haven't had a sip of my beer yet.

19:09.228 --> 19:11.128
Let's go.

19:14.928 --> 19:16.828
Alison, what's got into you?

19:16.928 --> 19:18.828
- Yeah, and where the hell are you going?
- I'm going home.

19:18.928 --> 19:21.129
- What about Lazlo and Charlotte?
- They were supposed to be ahead of us.

19:21.229 --> 19:23.629
<i>- We're probably in the wrong place.
- Evening, folks.</i>

19:23.729 --> 19:25.628
You people
look a little lost.

19:26.928 --> 19:29.029
No, we're not lost.
Just stupid.

19:29.129 --> 19:32.029
<i>We drove our car into a ditch
just outside of town.</i>

19:32.129 --> 19:34.029
<i>Sorry. I can't
help you there.</i>

19:34.129 --> 19:36.029
Our tow truck
is getting rebuilt.

19:36.129 --> 19:38.029
<i>Yeah. We heard all about it.</i>

19:38.129 --> 19:40.129
We were supposed to meet some
friends here, but they never showed.

19:40.229 --> 19:42.730
So what kind of a vehicle
are they driving?

19:42.830 --> 19:46.529
- Uh, it's a blue Pontiac Bonneville.
- No, I'm sorry.

19:46.629 --> 19:48.530
Haven't seen anything
around here like that.

19:48.630 --> 19:52.230
Well, is there like a bus or something
that we can take back into town?

19:52.330 --> 19:54.330
<i>Yeah. Back at the, uh,
highway junction.</i>

19:54.430 --> 19:57.430
Twice a day...
8:00 a.m., 8:00 p.m.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.430
If you run, you can
just about make it.

20:03.131 --> 20:05.131
Thanks.

20:07.131 --> 20:09.030
Thank you, sir.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.032
Oh! You guys,
I'm in heels!

20:27.832 --> 20:30.331
<i>Wait! Wait! Come back!</i>

20:34.232 --> 20:36.632
- Hey!
- Now what?

20:36.732 --> 20:39.933
I don't know.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.532
I got some blankets and stuff back
in the car. We can sleep there tonight.

20:42.732 --> 20:45.333
<i>What about those kids?</i>

20:45.433 --> 20:49.033
It'll be dark.
They won't even know we're there.

20:49.133 --> 20:51.033
Oh, man.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.734
<i>Look... my car!</i>

21:10.834 --> 21:13.433
That's my car!

21:16.334 --> 21:20.234
No! No!
No, no, no!

21:20.334 --> 21:23.535
No!

21:23.635 --> 21:26.234
It's not that great
of a car, Greg.

21:26.334 --> 21:28.235
I'm freezing.

21:30.435 --> 21:32.835
I think I saw a house
down the road.

21:32.935 --> 21:35.735
Maybe there's a phone
we can use.

21:40.535 --> 21:43.536
Looks deserted.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.635
<i>It's probably one of them
farm repos, you know?</i>

21:46.735 --> 21:48.635
Pretty soon,
this whole place...

21:48.735 --> 21:51.436
is gonna be
an industrial park.

22:00.436 --> 22:02.836
Hello!
Anybody home?

22:05.937 --> 22:08.036
Nobody's here.

22:08.136 --> 22:10.036
I say we stay here
for the night,

22:10.136 --> 22:12.037
catch the bus
in the morning.

22:14.037 --> 22:16.637
Sold!

22:22.737 --> 22:25.738
This place hasn't
been empty that long.

22:35.638 --> 22:37.938
Dead.

22:38.038 --> 22:41.238
Yeah, well, I'm hypogylcemic,
and I need to eat something now.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.638
Well, got running water.
Must be tapped into a spring.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.439
<i>You guys won't believe it.</i>

22:47.539 --> 22:51.338
The beds upstairs are fully made,
with sheets and everything.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.239
Like a roadside inn, huh?

23:00.139 --> 23:02.639
God! Are you okay?

23:02.739 --> 23:04.939
Oh, my God!
That was disgusting!

23:05.039 --> 23:07.740
- Yeah, a roadside inn with giant rats.
- Ugh!

23:13.639 --> 23:17.040
Well, we got pickles,
beans, fruit cocktail...

23:17.140 --> 23:19.040
Ooh! With the little
Maraschino cherries?

23:19.140 --> 23:21.440
<i>God, I love those.
What's that?</i>

23:23.140 --> 23:26.340
Mmm! Smeat!

23:26.440 --> 23:29.241
<i>Hey, guys, look what
I found in the basement.</i>

23:29.341 --> 23:31.741
It's even kind of cold.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.240
<i>To Kurt.</i>

23:38.741 --> 23:41.441
I guess we'll never know
what went wrong.

23:41.541 --> 23:44.442
I don't understand.
I thought bungee jumping was so safe.

23:44.542 --> 23:48.841
<i>Yeah, but that was Kurt.
He was a free spirit.</i>

23:48.941 --> 23:51.242
Come on, Alison.
Join the party. Have a beer.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.242
<i>- No, thanks.
- Come on!</i>

23:53.342 --> 23:56.841
- You never know when your
number's gonna be called.
- I said no.

24:07.942 --> 24:09.842
It wasn't an accident.

24:09.942 --> 24:11.943
<i>Say what?</i>

24:12.043 --> 24:14.943
<i>Sure it was.</i>

24:15.043 --> 24:17.442
<i>I mean, what, you think
he was murdered?</i>

24:17.542 --> 24:19.443
<i>When we were
packing up his apartment,</i>

24:19.543 --> 24:22.443
<i>I found a suicide note.</i>

24:24.543 --> 24:26.444
You're lying!

24:26.544 --> 24:29.643
<i>Kurt would never do that!</i>

24:29.743 --> 24:31.843
I got rid of the note
before anyone saw it.

24:31.943 --> 24:35.044
<i>I thought
I was helping Kir.</i>

24:35.144 --> 24:38.144
I was trying to protect you.

24:38.244 --> 24:43.044
Look, it doesn't matter.
It was wrong of me and I'm really sorry.

24:43.144 --> 24:46.444
Kir, you okay?

24:46.544 --> 24:48.345
Hey, baby.

24:51.744 --> 24:53.644
It's okay.

24:59.745 --> 25:02.945
Come on.
Lie back and try and get some rest.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.845
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

25:20.246 --> 25:22.646
I'll be in the next room
if you need...

25:22.746 --> 25:24.846
No, please.

25:24.946 --> 25:27.146
I don't want
to be alone.

25:46.747 --> 25:49.947
Look, Alison, I understand
if you don't want to talk about it.

25:53.548 --> 25:55.747
You know, you can trust me.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.348
<i>It's not that.
It's about my brother.</i>

25:58.448 --> 26:01.248
<i>You never told me
you had a brother.</i>

26:06.348 --> 26:10.548
Our father was a drinker,
and a mean drunk.

26:10.648 --> 26:15.449
When I got old enough,
I moved out and I never looked back.

26:15.549 --> 26:20.949
My dad got even worse,
and Jacob took the brunt of it.

26:21.049 --> 26:24.449
Finally ran away from home.
He was barely 14.

26:31.349 --> 26:33.550
I had no idea.

26:33.650 --> 26:35.550
I'm so sorry.

26:37.950 --> 26:41.150
The last thing he told me
before he left...

26:41.250 --> 26:44.050
was that he was
devoting his life...

26:44.250 --> 26:46.550
to He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

26:47.851 --> 26:50.750
<i>Do you think
he's with those kids?</i>

26:53.350 --> 26:56.451
When I heard that, my first impulse
was just to get the hell out of here,

26:56.551 --> 26:59.351
to get as far away
as possible.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.350
<i>He's your brother.</i>

27:01.450 --> 27:03.851
Don't you want to see him?

27:06.251 --> 27:09.152
Jacob doesn't want
anything to do with me.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.451
Thinks I've abandoned him.
And you know what?

27:12.551 --> 27:15.251
He's probably right.

28:43.356 --> 28:45.656
- What is it? What happened?
- Oh, my God!

28:45.756 --> 28:47.956
There was a man
at the window!

28:49.056 --> 28:51.656
I'm gonna get Greg.
You stay here.

29:02.456 --> 29:04.357
Hey.

29:05.957 --> 29:08.157
This mud is still wet.

29:09.757 --> 29:12.857
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

29:16.657 --> 29:18.558
I don't know.

29:20.758 --> 29:24.358
Alison!
What are you doing?

29:56.059 --> 29:57.959
What is this thing?

30:06.259 --> 30:08.160
Oh, my God!

30:08.260 --> 30:10.760
- It's blood!
- What?

30:16.760 --> 30:19.660
Oh, my God!
It's Charlotte!

30:19.760 --> 30:22.961
<i>And Lazlo!</i>

30:33.961 --> 30:36.362
<i>Sheriff, look!</i>

30:36.462 --> 30:39.361
- Got a little bit more.
- What the hell is that?

30:39.461 --> 30:42.362
I think it's a foot, sir.

30:46.962 --> 30:48.861
Well, I'll be damned.

30:51.262 --> 30:54.062
There's the big toe right there.

30:54.162 --> 30:56.262
Matches the one in there...

30:56.362 --> 30:58.263
I think.

31:15.963 --> 31:18.164
Look, Officer,
we just needed a place to stay.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.463
<i>- We didn't have anyplace else to go.
- Did I say you could talk?</i>

31:20.563 --> 31:23.763
<i>- No, sir. I thought I should explain...
- Then shut up.</i>

31:25.564 --> 31:30.364
- You people were out
drinking last night?
- No! We weren't.

31:33.364 --> 31:36.664
<i>- We just had a couple of beers.
- Couple of beers?</i>

31:43.764 --> 31:46.265
<i>Found that out
by the harvester.</i>

31:46.365 --> 31:49.165
You-You don't think that
we had anything to do with this?

31:49.265 --> 31:51.165
<i>My God!
They were our friends!</i>

31:51.265 --> 31:54.965
You got no business messing around
with that heavy equipment.

31:55.065 --> 31:57.065
It's dangerous as hell.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.266
<i>You're lucky all of you
didn't get killed.</i>

32:09.066 --> 32:10.966
One more thing.

32:11.066 --> 32:14.366
<i>I want you on that
8:00 a.m. Bus out of here.</i>

32:14.465 --> 32:17.566
You got it?

32:17.766 --> 32:19.666
<i>Got it.</i>

32:25.966 --> 32:28.666
Alison, come on.
Let's get the hell out of Dodge.

32:28.766 --> 32:30.667
We're right behind you.

32:30.767 --> 32:32.567
I'm staying.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.667
I have to find out.

32:41.867 --> 32:43.868
This is about your
brother, isn't it?

32:53.168 --> 32:55.668
- Well, we gotta stick together.
- No way.

32:57.868 --> 33:01.268
- Come on, man. We can't let her
go out there by herself.
- No way.

33:01.368 --> 33:04.268
You got no proof
your brother's out there.

33:04.368 --> 33:07.269
You're just gonna have to drag
my dead body by my little toes...

33:07.369 --> 33:09.768
<i>before I ever,
ever, ever...</i>

33:09.868 --> 33:12.569
"Stick together."

33:12.669 --> 33:14.869
You know what? When these wack-jobs
stick our dead bodies...

33:14.969 --> 33:17.369
in a mass grave,
then we'll be stuck together.

33:18.670 --> 33:20.569
Did you hear that?

33:20.669 --> 33:22.569
You know they're
watching us.

33:22.769 --> 33:25.169
<i>They could be cannibals
for all we know.</i>

33:25.269 --> 33:27.770
Yeah, well, maybe you should join them.
Then you could eat me.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.870
Hey.

33:29.970 --> 33:33.070
<i>Check out
the welcoming committee.</i>

33:35.870 --> 33:38.370
You're on private property.

33:39.570 --> 33:41.970
Well, I want to talk
to my brotherJacob.

33:43.870 --> 33:45.770
Alison?

33:50.171 --> 33:52.170
He doesn't want to see you.

33:53.270 --> 33:57.371
Do I have to get
the police?

33:59.071 --> 34:01.372
That won't be necessary.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.171
This way.

34:38.373 --> 34:40.572
The rest of you
stay here.

34:40.672 --> 34:43.172
We all stick together.

34:44.774 --> 34:46.672
You gonna be all right?

34:46.773 --> 34:48.672
I'll be fine.

35:04.374 --> 35:06.275
Wait here.

35:14.975 --> 35:17.175
Oh, uh, yeah.

35:17.275 --> 35:20.675
I should go, uh,
milk a cow or something.

35:26.576 --> 35:28.476
Kir, about last night.

35:28.576 --> 35:31.175
What about it?

35:31.275 --> 35:35.776
I just want to let you know
that I care a lot about you,

35:37.676 --> 35:41.576
and it wasn't just
a one-night stand for me.

35:41.776 --> 35:43.676
I'm sorry, Ty,

35:43.776 --> 35:46.176
but that's all it was for me.

36:18.278 --> 36:22.078
The outsiders call me
a monster...

36:22.178 --> 36:26.778
a molester, a lunatic.

36:26.878 --> 36:29.878
But I am none
of these things.

36:29.978 --> 36:31.879
I am a prophet.

36:31.979 --> 36:33.879
I am the savior...

36:33.979 --> 36:36.478
<i>of these children.</i>

36:38.879 --> 36:41.079
Saving them from what?

36:43.079 --> 36:46.179
Years ago, it was,

36:46.279 --> 36:49.879
I was working in the fields...

36:49.979 --> 36:54.080
and I came upon
an infant child...

36:54.180 --> 36:57.379
<i>who had been left there...</i>

36:57.479 --> 37:00.880
to die among the corn rows.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.781
I took him home.

37:06.881 --> 37:10.980
I raised him as my own.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.581
About that time,

37:13.681 --> 37:16.681
the eternal flame...

37:16.781 --> 37:20.381
<i>sparked to life,
acting as a beacon...</i>

37:20.481 --> 37:24.081
to all those
forgotten children...

37:24.181 --> 37:26.981
who had been abused
and neglected...

37:27.081 --> 37:29.781
by their so-called parents.

37:31.281 --> 37:33.781
I gave them love,

37:34.882 --> 37:36.782
I gave them family,

37:39.782 --> 37:42.182
and I gave them purpose.

37:42.282 --> 37:44.282
Now they have
the chance to serve...

37:44.382 --> 37:47.782
<i>a higher order...
to worship...</i>

37:47.882 --> 37:50.882
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

37:53.082 --> 37:58.283
Yet, you have come here to threaten
the harmony we have established.

37:58.383 --> 38:00.383
I just want to see
my brother.

38:02.282 --> 38:06.283
I understand your concern.

38:06.383 --> 38:10.184
Our ways must seem
strange to you.

38:10.284 --> 38:12.783
But you must acknowledge...

38:12.883 --> 38:14.983
When your brother
first came to us,

38:15.083 --> 38:17.083
he was very depressed...

38:17.184 --> 38:20.284
<i>suicidal, actually.</i>

38:20.384 --> 38:25.784
And under my tutelage,
he has flourished and blossomed,

38:25.884 --> 38:28.784
like the proverbial
spring flower.

38:30.084 --> 38:33.885
Well, then you shouldn't
fear my talking with him.

38:43.285 --> 38:46.485
Yes. Of course.

38:48.185 --> 38:51.485
We have no secrets here.

38:51.585 --> 38:54.386
Ezekiel will show you to him.

38:58.485 --> 39:00.586
You are dismissed.

40:13.089 --> 40:14.989
Hey, stretch.

40:15.089 --> 40:17.389
Uh, just looking for a place
to take a leak, you know?

40:19.590 --> 40:21.890
- Uh, you know what?
I'm just gonna go.
- Go.

40:21.990 --> 40:23.889
That's what I said.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.890
- I'm gonna go now.
- Now.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.090
Now. It's a...
It's a great idea.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.690
Just gonna go this way.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.690
Nice ax.

40:48.191 --> 40:50.791
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:53.291 --> 40:57.391
- What's your name?
- Kir.

40:57.491 --> 40:59.691
I'm Zane.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.292
Forgive me
for-for-for being forward,

41:03.392 --> 41:05.292
What? What is it?

41:05.392 --> 41:07.992
It's just that
since I first saw you...

41:08.092 --> 41:10.492
I could tell
that you were hurting.

41:12.192 --> 41:16.493
I got the feeling that
you were in a lot of pain.

41:16.593 --> 41:19.492
Somebody really close to me
died recently.

41:21.292 --> 41:25.093
I'm not trying to make any judgments
about you, but I know how you feel.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.793
I was there myself
not too long ago.

41:35.193 --> 41:38.294
Kir, there is good
in this world.

41:38.394 --> 41:41.693
It's not all terrible.

41:41.793 --> 41:45.194
I found some of that
good right here on this farm.

41:45.394 --> 41:48.794
You see, we all start
with a heart that's pure...

41:48.894 --> 41:51.194
and joyful.

41:51.294 --> 41:53.694
And sometimes
we lose that along the way.

41:53.794 --> 41:56.594
But it can
be found again,

41:56.694 --> 41:59.995
if only you'll let
He Who Walks Behind the Rows...

42:00.095 --> 42:02.794
show you the way.

42:11.294 --> 42:13.195
I have to get back
to my friends.

42:13.295 --> 42:15.395
Okay.

42:36.596 --> 42:39.896
- Jacob?
- Alison.

42:39.996 --> 42:41.897
I can't believe
it's really you.

42:41.997 --> 42:45.796
- How did you find me?
- I'm not sure.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.697
<i>A lot of luck and
a little intuition, I guess.</i>

42:54.197 --> 42:56.297
Do you mind?
I'd like a few moments alone.

42:56.497 --> 42:59.097
I'll wait outside.

43:07.897 --> 43:11.298
- Happy birthday.
- Not till tomorrow.

43:11.398 --> 43:13.898
<i>I know. I just...</i>

43:15.398 --> 43:17.198
Dad passed away
a few months ago.

43:17.298 --> 43:20.598
That was inevitable,
wasn't it?

43:24.799 --> 43:27.298
Jacob, I know
it wasn't easy for you.

43:27.398 --> 43:30.599
<i>- You left me alone with him.
- And I'm so sorry.</i>

43:30.699 --> 43:33.399
<i>Please give me a chance to make it
up to you. Come home with me.</i>

43:33.499 --> 43:36.799
This is my home.
This is my family.

43:36.899 --> 43:41.199
I have a wife now.
Luke chose her to bear my child.

43:41.299 --> 43:43.499
He chose her?

43:44.600 --> 43:46.500
Do you love her?

43:47.800 --> 43:51.500
Of course. Uh, what kind
of a question is that?

43:51.600 --> 43:54.500
Why is everyone
so young here?

43:54.600 --> 43:57.300
Children are still
pure of heart and mind.

43:57.500 --> 44:01.600
They have not yet been corrupted
by the ways of the outsiders.

44:01.700 --> 44:05.801
After your 18th birthday
and you become an adult,

44:05.901 --> 44:08.401
enter the age of sin.

44:08.501 --> 44:11.100
For you that's tomorrow.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.801
Yes, it is.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.701
What about Luke? He's an adult;
does that make him evil?

44:17.801 --> 44:19.902
Luke is...

44:20.002 --> 44:22.201
different.

44:22.301 --> 44:25.001
Jacob, do you want
to stay here?

44:29.002 --> 44:31.002
You must leave now.

44:34.502 --> 44:36.402
Jacob.

44:51.303 --> 44:53.902
Wait.

44:58.703 --> 45:02.003
I want you
to have this book.

45:16.003 --> 45:18.204
This will help you
understand.

45:39.105 --> 45:42.005
- What the hell happened in there?
- I'm not sure.

45:42.105 --> 45:44.205
What, so that's it?

45:45.306 --> 45:47.206
Alison.

45:47.306 --> 45:50.905
Hey! Did you even
see your brother?

45:56.806 --> 45:59.005
Alison?

45:59.105 --> 46:01.006
Did you read
what your brother wrote?

46:02.006 --> 46:03.906
No.

46:04.006 --> 46:09.307
"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,
Earth our only father..." Hey!

46:09.407 --> 46:11.706
Let's see here.

46:11.906 --> 46:15.807
<i>Hey, look! A recipe...
for cyanide fruit punch.</i>

46:15.907 --> 46:18.207
<i>I was reading the book and
it makes a lot of sense, you guys.</i>

46:18.307 --> 46:20.707
Like what?

46:20.807 --> 46:25.907
Basically it says
children are born into this world
free of sin and completely pure.

46:26.007 --> 46:30.508
<i>And being raised by adults,
well, that's when they become...</i>

46:30.608 --> 46:32.907
you know,
when they become tainted.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.708
Tainted.

46:35.808 --> 46:37.708
Evil.

46:41.008 --> 46:44.308
You're losin' it, Kir.

46:44.508 --> 46:47.708
What do you think, Al?

46:47.808 --> 46:52.409
There's probably a lot of truth in it.
That's what makes it so dangerous.

46:52.509 --> 46:56.309
Yeah, well, two of our friends
died last night,

46:56.409 --> 46:59.509
and I'm not stickin' around
to see history repeat itself.

47:10.710 --> 47:13.210
So who's comin' with me?

47:13.310 --> 47:16.609
<i>Kir?
You comin'or not?</i>

47:16.809 --> 47:18.810
Yeah, I guess.

47:18.910 --> 47:20.810
Come on, you guys.

47:20.910 --> 47:23.710
What happened to our, like,
musketeer thing we had goin'?

47:23.810 --> 47:26.210
<i>- You know, all for one, one for all?
- Look,</i>

47:26.310 --> 47:31.310
we were all there to support her
and she came home empty-handed.

47:33.711 --> 47:35.911
Ain't my problem anymore.

47:44.711 --> 47:47.112
What are you going to do?

47:49.111 --> 47:52.411
Don't worry about me.
I'll figure something out.

48:26.013 --> 48:27.913
"On the eve
of thine 18th journey,

48:28.013 --> 48:32.713
around the blazing star that gave
birth to all life in Creation,

48:34.613 --> 48:40.114
ye shall be returned
to the earth and embraced
by He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

48:56.014 --> 49:01.115
He Who Walks Behind the Rows,
Earth our only father,

49:01.215 --> 49:05.715
let him into your heart to purge
the demons of gluttony and avarice."

49:17.415 --> 49:19.716
Oh, my God.

49:26.716 --> 49:29.016
Thought I told you
to be on that bus.

49:49.817 --> 49:52.917
<i>You got a thing
for her, don't you?</i>

49:54.518 --> 49:56.618
Well, what's your excuse?

49:56.718 --> 49:59.617
I guess I have nobody
to go home to.

50:34.219 --> 50:37.320
- You coming?
- I'll wait out here.

50:50.821 --> 50:53.020
Hey, Alison.

50:54.520 --> 50:57.921
Alison, are you here?

51:02.421 --> 51:05.121
Kir?

51:05.221 --> 51:07.921
Hey, Kir,
where are you?

51:11.421 --> 51:13.821
Kir?

51:13.921 --> 51:16.021
- Kir!
- Calm down, Ty.

51:16.221 --> 51:18.121
- It's those goddamn kids!
- Just relax, all right?

51:18.321 --> 51:20.922
- They're gone, Greg.
- Don't jump to conclusions.

51:21.022 --> 51:24.022
First it was Alison,
now it's Kir.

51:24.122 --> 51:27.022
Where else could they be?

51:31.122 --> 51:35.122
We worship thine eminence
on this special day,

51:35.222 --> 51:38.122
<i>for today is Jacob's day.</i>

51:38.222 --> 51:43.023
Jacob, ye shall ascend the ladder
and leap forth into the eternal flame,

51:43.123 --> 51:46.822
<i>and become one with
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.</i>

51:48.323 --> 51:51.123
<i>From thine ashes a new crop
shall be born among us.</i>

52:16.225 --> 52:18.824
- I can't.
- Jacob,

52:18.924 --> 52:22.224
it is the way of
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

52:25.625 --> 52:28.525
I know, but I can't.
I won't.

52:28.625 --> 52:30.625
You must.

52:30.725 --> 52:33.925
You said I was free to leave
whenever I wanted to.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.925
And you are.

52:36.025 --> 52:39.626
But who will you go to in the decaying,
wretched world of the outsiders?

52:39.726 --> 52:42.625
<i>Your sister
that betrayed you?</i>

52:48.426 --> 52:53.826
Lilly, come with me. We can raise
our own family. We don't need them.

52:59.527 --> 53:02.126
This is my family, Jacob.

53:21.528 --> 53:24.727
<i>Now that we have been
betrayed byJacob,</i>

53:24.927 --> 53:29.628
we must not disappoint
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

53:29.728 --> 53:32.628
Who among us will next
be 18 years old?

53:33.728 --> 53:36.728
I will.

53:43.329 --> 53:45.328
Why do you come here,
outsider?

53:45.428 --> 53:48.128
I've read the book,

53:48.229 --> 53:51.829
and for the first time
in my life I know my purpose.

53:53.629 --> 53:58.029
- What is your purpose?
- To reject the world of the aged...

53:58.129 --> 54:00.229
before I reach the age of sin,

54:00.329 --> 54:03.730
and to join He Who Walks
Behind the Rows...

54:03.930 --> 54:06.830
<i>because Kurt is
waiting there for me.</i>

54:08.129 --> 54:10.030
Come with us,
beautiful child,

54:10.130 --> 54:12.230
<i>for today shall be
your day.</i>

56:51.737 --> 56:56.038
You've challenged my authority
and committed heresy against Him.

56:58.238 --> 57:03.638
<i>That kind of insubordination
will not be tolerated!</i>

57:09.439 --> 57:14.238
Now your sole purpose
is to scare away the birds...

57:14.339 --> 57:19.239
and other vermin
that violate our cornfields.

57:21.440 --> 57:24.239
The outsiders are coming!

57:24.339 --> 57:27.239
I'll be there in a minute.

57:30.940 --> 57:33.339
Put him in the cornfield.

57:33.439 --> 57:35.840
<i>Be sure to cut his throat...</i>

57:35.940 --> 57:38.740
so that his screams
can't be heard.

59:00.443 --> 59:04.244
- Stay close to me at all times,
you understand?
- Yeah.

59:15.645 --> 59:19.945
Sheriff's department.
Got a warrant to search these premises.

59:31.246 --> 59:33.845
You have no right
to be here.

59:34.045 --> 59:37.846
- Where's your warrant?
- Right here, kid, to be
delivered to Luke Enright.

59:37.946 --> 59:39.646
- Get out of my way.
- No!

59:49.646 --> 59:53.047
I've been wanting to nail your ass
for a long time, Luke.

59:58.347 --> 01:00:00.547
<i>If you try to
extinguish that flame,</i>

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:06.547
your men will be punished
with a vengeance such as His fury...

01:00:06.647 --> 01:00:09.347
hath not wrought before.

01:00:09.547 --> 01:00:12.548
You threatening me, Luke?

01:00:12.748 --> 01:00:16.847
I am tryin' to save you.

01:00:50.449 --> 01:00:52.849
Jesus!

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.151
Why don't you step
into the light where I can see you?

01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:33.351
I warn you, Sheriff.

01:01:33.451 --> 01:01:35.751
You're under arrest
for threatening an officer.

01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:40.852
Don't do this.

01:01:50.952 --> 01:01:53.852
It is out of my hands now.

01:02:13.054 --> 01:02:15.453
What the...

01:02:40.954 --> 01:02:45.155
<i>Don't feel bad for Luke.
He's been dead for years.</i>

01:02:47.854 --> 01:02:50.555
You did this!

01:02:58.156 --> 01:03:02.155
<i>We all have a few skeletons
left in the closet, Alison.</i>

01:03:02.255 --> 01:03:06.656
Fortunately, I was able to put mine
to good use, as our leader.

01:04:09.959 --> 01:04:11.859
You okay?
Come on.

01:04:17.859 --> 01:04:21.460
- There's no keys. Where's Kir?
- I thought she was with you!

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.660
Behind you!

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.460
Oh, God!

01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:37.060
Hurry up!

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.960
I got 'em!
I got 'em!

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.961
- Where'd they go?
- Come on! Come on!

01:04:56.161 --> 01:05:00.661
Get up! Come on!

01:05:00.761 --> 01:05:02.961
- I hurt my ankle.
- Get up!

01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:05.962
Oh, my God!

01:05:06.062 --> 01:05:08.362
- I think I can run.
- Let's go!

01:05:23.762 --> 01:05:25.663
Go!

01:05:34.963 --> 01:05:38.663
I think we lost 'em.

01:05:45.963 --> 01:05:48.364
Oh, my God,
it's Jacob!

01:05:52.863 --> 01:05:56.364
I'll stay here with him.
You make sure all the doors are locked.

01:05:58.564 --> 01:06:00.665
Jacob.

01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:05.864
This is all my fault.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.065
No.

01:06:16.865 --> 01:06:19.165
I remember...

01:06:19.265 --> 01:06:22.066
all those times...

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:25.365
<i>you protected me
from Dad.</i>

01:06:25.465 --> 01:06:28.065
<i>You were just a kid too.</i>

01:06:29.366 --> 01:06:32.066
I thought
when I came here...

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:34.166
I could begin again,
you know?

01:06:34.266 --> 01:06:37.966
I didn't want
to be like him.

01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:40.666
Now I'm gonna be
a father.

01:06:40.766 --> 01:06:45.967
But you didn't know about Ezekiel
and all the killings, did you?

01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:55.467
There's still time
to stop him.

01:06:56.567 --> 01:06:58.867
How?

01:06:58.967 --> 01:07:00.867
Fight fire with fire.

01:07:00.967 --> 01:07:04.067
In the storage shed
there's...

01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:11.668
I love you.

01:07:13.168 --> 01:07:15.868
I love you too.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:30.568
Greg!

01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:32.869
Charlotte's car.

01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:35.369
This is our ticket
out of here.

01:07:38.469 --> 01:07:40.569
Oh...

01:07:40.669 --> 01:07:42.569
Oh, sh...

01:07:42.669 --> 01:07:44.669
God!

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.869
Okay.

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:51.869
Let's see here.

01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.770
<i>All right, try it again.</i>

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:08.371
Aw, come on, come on!

01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:11.171
Aw, shoot!

01:08:12.771 --> 01:08:14.670
Oh, man.

01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:17.671
I could probably jury-rig somethin'
but it's gonna take a little while.

01:08:34.871 --> 01:08:36.772
Fertilizer.

01:08:42.072 --> 01:08:44.872
Wait!
I thought I heard something.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.973
Help! Help!

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:07.773
Alison, move!

01:09:10.073 --> 01:09:13.774
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:20.677
Ty?

01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:03.079
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:10.279
Can't we talk about this?

01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:48.081
I got your eternal flame
right here!

01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:17.583
Fight fire...

01:12:17.683 --> 01:12:19.583
with fire.

01:12:31.684 --> 01:12:34.883
<i>Our family has been
torn asunder.</i>

01:12:35.983 --> 01:12:38.884
Our brethren lie broken...

01:12:38.984 --> 01:12:41.284
and bleeding all around us.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:47.584
<i>Before the last few innocent souls
on Earth have been annihilated,</i>

01:12:49.684 --> 01:12:51.984
<i>we shall escape...</i>

01:12:54.885 --> 01:12:59.384
and join He Who Walks
Behind the Rows in a better place.

01:13:01.285 --> 01:13:05.085
Now, follow me, children.

01:16:11.794 --> 01:16:15.694
Did Ezekiel join
He Who Walks Behind the Rows?

01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:18.895
I don't know.

01:16:18.995 --> 01:16:21.094
He just might have.

01:16:21.194 --> 01:16:23.294
Will we get
to go there?

01:16:26.395 --> 01:16:28.395
I don't think it's
your time yet.

01:17:12.697 --> 01:17:16.297
- Hi.
- You must be Alison.

01:17:16.397 --> 01:17:18.797
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

01:17:45.899 --> 01:17:47.871
Lilly's really not equipped
to be a mother.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:50.147
After all, she's only a child herself.

01:17:50.798 --> 01:17:53.099
<i>She has her whole life
ahead of her.</i>

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:57.599
It really wouldn't be fair
to her... or the baby.

01:17:58.899 --> 01:18:01.599
<i>I know it's
the right thing for him.</i>

01:18:01.699 --> 01:18:05.199
It's what Jacob would
have wanted.

01:18:05.299 --> 01:18:08.799
<i>I'll take good care
of him, I promise.</i>

01:18:09.998 --> 01:18:12.398
Thank you.

01:18:12.498 --> 01:18:14.898
<i>Well,</i>

01:18:14.998 --> 01:18:19.898
why don't we all go and let you two
get to know one another.

01:18:19.998 --> 01:18:21.797
<i>Lilly.</i>

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.497
<i>Lilly?</i>

01:18:32.596 --> 01:18:34.496
Hey, sweetie.

01:18:34.596 --> 01:18:36.496
Hey, you.

01:18:40.396 --> 01:18:44.695
# Hush, little baby
Don't say a word #

01:18:44.795 --> 01:18:50.195
# Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird #

01:18:51.395 --> 01:18:55.994
#And if that mockingbird
don't sing #

01:18:56.094 --> 01:19:00.494
# Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring #

01:19:01.794 --> 01:19:05.693
# If that diamond ring
turns brass #

01:19:07.793 --> 01:19:12.203
<i>#Mama's gonna buy you
a looking glass ##</i>
