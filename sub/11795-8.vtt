00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.906
  <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
  <i>morning and the alarm</i>
  <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:09.809
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:12.746
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.779 --> 00:16.349
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:21.955
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.988 --> 00:25.058
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.091 --> 00:28.028
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.061 --> 00:30.864
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.897 --> 00:34.467
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.501 --> 00:39.005
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.989
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:56.022 --> 00:58.892
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.925 --> 01:03.630
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

01:09.102 --> 01:11.671
   Belding: All right,
   let's go people.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.073
 Find a seat.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.709
   You too, Slater.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.945
 -What's up guys?
 -Hey, Slater.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.081
Here's the latest
Bayside survey.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.616
   98% of the students
   favor two days of school

01:23.650 --> 01:24.951
and a five-day weekend.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.721
 -Right, guys?
 -( applause )

01:29.856 --> 01:34.127
   And now the results
   of the principal
   popularity poll.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.197
Whoops.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.570
  As you can see,
  it's heading
  straight for China.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.141
Zack, sit down.
You're ticking him off.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.176
  Wait. What about
  classes on the beach? Huh?

01:50.210 --> 01:52.812
   Just sit.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.814
Now, before we
continue our assembly,

01:54.848 --> 01:56.483
our principal has
a special announcement.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.618
 Let's hear it for Mr. Belding.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.489
   You're winning
   in the back, sir.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
Thank you,
Jessie.

02:10.663 --> 02:11.965
 Listen up, everybody,

02:12.065 --> 02:13.933
 because two weeks
 from tonight,

02:13.967 --> 02:17.570
 we are holding the annual
 Miss Bayside Beauty Pageant.

02:17.604 --> 02:18.905
 ( cheering )

02:20.140 --> 02:22.709
   Swimsuit,
   swimsuit!

02:22.742 --> 02:25.078
 ( chanting )
 Swimsuit, swimsuit...

02:25.078 --> 02:27.681
  All right, all right,
  all right.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.850
 The lucky winner
 will then go on
 to compete for the title of...

02:30.884 --> 02:32.619
 Miss High School California!

02:36.790 --> 02:38.158
   A beauty pageant?

02:38.191 --> 02:41.227
 What a stupid,
 sexist waste of time!

02:41.261 --> 02:43.296
   Not if you're
   in a teeny bikini, Mama!

02:46.099 --> 02:49.269
I can't believe it.
A woman ran for
Vice President,

02:49.302 --> 02:50.970
  a woman sits on
  the Supreme Court,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.807
 and Belding still wants us
 parading around
 in bathing suits.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.842
 But Jessie,
 when those women go swimming,

02:55.875 --> 02:57.310
  don't they wear
  bathing suits too?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.012
   Ooh!
   Let's see you
   counter that one.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.781
 Kelly, we're human beings,
 not sex objects.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.050
 I just don't want to be judged
 on my measurements.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.152
   Why not? You've got
   some great ones.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.854
 Yeah!

03:10.657 --> 03:13.059
  Every beauty pageant takes us
  one step backwards

03:13.059 --> 03:14.561
  in our war against sexism.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.630
  You can take me prisoner
  in that war anytime, baby.

03:17.664 --> 03:20.166
 Jessie does
 have a point.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.903
  Yeah. I was going to enter,
  but after
  listening to you, I won't.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.574
 Oh, great. This is going to be
 some beauty pageant.
 Woof woof.

03:27.607 --> 03:30.076
 Kelly, why don't you,
 Lisa and I form a picket line?

03:30.076 --> 03:32.245
   -Not me, girl. I'm entering.
   -Why?

03:32.278 --> 03:34.714
 Because I want to be
 Miss High School California.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.283
  -It's fun being pretty.
  -You are hopeless.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.285
  Come on, Kelly.
  Let's go make picket signs.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.822
How about some with
pretty pink letters and
cute little hearts?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.359
 -See ya.
 -Bye.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.963
Lisa, you are
one lucky girl.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.899
  Now that Kelly's out of
  the pageant, I'm throwing my
  support to you.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.701
   Big deal.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.137
  For your information, Slater,
  I happen to be an expert.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.005
I've got videotapes
of every beauty pageant

03:59.105 --> 04:01.608
from Miss Universe
to Miss U-Haul.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.577
 And I'd be happy
 to offer my services.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.746
Thanks.
But no thanks.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.685
Yeah, well, I tell you,

04:11.718 --> 04:13.586
 she's going
 to regret refusing my offer.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.121
   Oh, come on,
   Preppie.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.089
 You know as much
 about beauty pageants

04:17.123 --> 04:19.192
  as I know about
  wearing pantyhose.

04:19.225 --> 04:22.729
  Oh yeah? I bet you
  I could take anyone

04:22.762 --> 04:24.731
and make them
the next Miss Bayside.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.334
All right, it's a bet.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.369
   50 bucks.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.304
   And since you said you could
   take anyone,

04:31.338 --> 04:32.972
I get to pick
the contestant.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.742
-You got it.
-Deal.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.912
Let me see here.
Hmm...

04:42.916 --> 04:44.951
   Too cute.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.357
  Too sweet.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.293
   Hi, guys!

04:54.728 --> 04:56.896
 Too perfect.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.432
  -Screech?
  -Hey, Zack,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.701
 wanna see me drink
 a milkshake through my nose?

05:03.370 --> 05:06.940
I bet no one'll beat him
in the talent contest.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.177
 Hey, who drank my root beer?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.246
   ( burps )

05:14.414 --> 05:17.717
 Sorry, Zack.
 Potato chips make me thirsty.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.820
  Screech, I have something
  very important to tell you.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.823
  ALF flew back
  to Melmac?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.725
  No.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.661
  The next Miss Bayside
  is right here in this room.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.068
Kevin!

05:35.068 --> 05:39.072
 -I'm so happy for you.
 -Me?

05:39.072 --> 05:42.075
   Not Kevin.
   You, you doofus.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.979
Zack, I thought you
knew this already,
  but I'm a guy.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.248
 It doesn't matter.
 The rules don't say anything

05:48.281 --> 05:50.283
 about Miss Bayside
 having to be a girl.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.885
   Let me see those.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.455
 I'll need my glasses.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.063
Okay, let's see here...
( mutters )

06:03.096 --> 06:05.865
bing! He's right, boss,
you can enter.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.034
   But do something
   about your hair.

06:10.136 --> 06:13.039
   But I don't want
   to enter, Zack.
   No one would vote for me.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.810
  That's because the other kids
  don't know the real you.

06:16.843 --> 06:20.246
 They don't realize
 all your wonderful qualities.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.248
-I have some?
-Yeah.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.050
 You're full of them.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.454
 You'll go where no man
 has ever gone before.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.958
Okay. But I have
to be home before dark.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.169
Sisters! Don't sign up
for the beauty pageant.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.271
   Let Belding know
   we're united against him.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.406
 Yeah!

06:48.875 --> 06:51.211
   Kelly, show some
   more enthusiasm.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.179
 Right. Okay.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.487
Belding is a sexist!
Rah, rah, rah!

07:02.155 --> 07:05.859
  On second thought,
  just carry the sign, okay?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.395
  Hi, Jessie, Kelly.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.030
  Nice signs.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.398
   They would've been
   prettier in pink.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.033
  We don't talk to traitors.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.172
  Hi, guys. I just entered
  the beauty pageant.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.841
  -Wish me luck.
  -Lisa, you had your chance.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.443
 Now I'm backing
 a better contestant.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.345
   -Who?
   -Screech.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.047
  ( laughs )

07:30.216 --> 07:32.118
  ( low )
  ''Ban Miss Bayside.'' Huh.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.563
 Zack, are Jessie and Kelly
 still out there
 with those signs?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.298
  -Still there, sir.
  -Don't worry, sir,

07:45.331 --> 07:46.433
  I don't think you're a pig.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.171
 Sir, can I please have
 an entry form for the pageant?

07:51.204 --> 07:54.174
  Oh, great. Now I suppose
  you want to enter.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.209
 Don't be ridiculous.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.945
-I'm entering Screech.
-Are you crazy?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.413
You can't enter a man.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.384
 I'm not entering a man.
 I'm entering Screech.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.220
 I'm sorry but this contest
 is only for women.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.256
 Why? Why should women be
 the only ones put on parade?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.892
 I think it's
 a great idea to enter
 a man in the pageant.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.828
 It makes a statement.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.130
   Oh, you want a statement?
   Well, here's a statement:

08:17.163 --> 08:19.332
   ''No way, Jose!''

08:19.366 --> 08:21.534
   Now I'll never
   be beauty queen.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.403
   -Hold it!
   -Hold it!

08:23.436 --> 08:26.206
  If you don't let Screech in,
  you're
  discriminating against men.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.308
  They'll just join us
  in the picket line.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.945
 Yeah. I'll get you 20 good men
 by lunch, Jessie.

08:32.044 --> 08:35.148
  I can deliver three geeks
  and a nerd.

08:35.181 --> 08:39.284
   Wait a minute now. Let's not
   let this thing get
   out of hand here.

08:39.318 --> 08:42.422
   Jessie, if I let this...

08:42.455 --> 08:44.157
 contestant enter the pageant,

08:44.190 --> 08:46.059
   will you stop
   your protesting?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.061
Well...

08:48.094 --> 08:52.065
 a man in a beauty contest
 would be a big step forward.

08:52.098 --> 08:56.403
 All right. Let Screech enter
 and I'll call off the protest.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.972
   Okay.
   Sign up.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.507
 Mom will be so proud.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.381
 I don't believe this.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.850
Screech is making a mockery
out of the pageant.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.887
 No, Lisa. This is the
 first time the pageant
 hasn't been a mockery.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.356
 People should vote
 for the inner person.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.458
  Give me a break.
  It's easy for you to talk.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.893
  You're not in the contest.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.429
   I'd feel the same way
   if I were in it.

09:22.462 --> 09:25.432
  No, you'd feel ridiculous
  competing against Screech.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.735
  No, she wouldn't.
  I bet Jessie would be proud

09:28.768 --> 09:31.705
to be part of
an event that treats
men and women equally.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.574
  -Right, Jessie?
  -Well, yeah. I suppose so.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.344
 -Then why don't you enter?
 -Yeah.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.713
  Yeah, show off
  your inner person.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.782
All right, I will.
I'm in.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.818
Right. Way to go, Mama.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.489
   I mean, Ms. Mama.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.327
   -Jessie what?
   -I saw it with
   my own two eyes.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.262
  She entered
  the beauty pageant.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.666
She thinks she's got
the prettiest ''inner
person'' in the school.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.967
 Let's see if her inner person

10:01.001 --> 10:03.403
  can match my outer person
  in a bikini.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.905
 Ooh.
 Does that mean you're going
 to give her some competition?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.640
   -You're darn right I am.
   -Great.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.676
  Having a beauty contest
  without you, Kelly,

10:09.709 --> 10:12.312
   is like having
   snap and crackle
   without the pop.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.648
  Hey, guys.
  What's up?

10:15.682 --> 10:19.619
   Nothing much, except that
   the Miss Bayside has
   become a real contest

10:19.652 --> 10:21.621
   now that Jessie
   and Kelly are in.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.090
   What?
   Kelly, you're in?

10:24.124 --> 10:27.527
Yeah, and don't feel bad
about backing
Screech instead of me.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.763
-No hard feelings?
-Of course not.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.432
 And until the pageant is over,
 no more dates.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.577
Kelly.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.547
   Could you hand me
   my towel, please?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.549
 Sure.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.654
 What does that mean?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.557
 It means you're a hypocrite!
 Talking me out of the pageant,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.459
 and then you
 entering it yourself!

10:59.492 --> 11:02.962
  Excuse me, but I'm in because
  the politics
  behind it changed.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.532
  But I wouldn't expect
  you to grasp that.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.733
  Your understanding
  of politics

11:06.766 --> 11:10.403
 is limited to who
 won the election
 on ''Sesame Street.''

11:12.072 --> 11:13.773
  Can you believe
  this snob?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.842
  I can't believe you,
  Kelly-come-lately!

11:15.875 --> 11:17.377
  Me?

11:17.410 --> 11:18.812
  It's not enough for you to be
  Homecoming Queen,

11:18.845 --> 11:21.381
you have to butt
into the pageant
 to upstage me!

11:21.414 --> 11:23.683
  I've got news for you.
  This is one beauty pageant

11:23.717 --> 11:25.085
you are not gonna win.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.090
   It is not
   a beauty contest anymore.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.692
That's right,
you entered it!

11:34.761 --> 11:37.130
  -Watch it, cheerleader!
  -Watch it, egghead!

11:37.163 --> 11:39.099
   ( all shouting )

11:39.099 --> 11:41.701
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.837
 What are we getting
 so upset for?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.573
  We are up against Screech.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.109
 ( laughing )

11:53.113 --> 11:55.582
  All right, rehearsals
  for the talent competition.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.117
  Let's go.
  Come on, everybody.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.688
   Jeannie Tyler,
   you're up first.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.058
   ( marching music plays )

12:21.574 --> 12:23.610
( music stops )

12:24.577 --> 12:26.646
   ( piano playing )

12:26.680 --> 12:28.148
   ( violin plays )

12:57.544 --> 13:00.914
The caterpillar emerges
from a cocoon

13:00.947 --> 13:04.050
and takes
a look at her new body.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.087
Now she is a butterfly.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.089
  Now she has wings,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.825
 and now she can fly!

13:19.232 --> 13:21.234
Screech's chances
look better than ever.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.670
 Just wait till
 you hear Kelly sing.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.905
 She's got a voice like a bird.
 Watch.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.643
( piano plays )

13:31.878 --> 13:34.848
   ( off-key singing )
   Blue moon

13:34.881 --> 13:38.518
You saw me
standing alone

13:38.551 --> 13:42.222
  Without a dream
  in my heart

13:42.255 --> 13:46.793
  Without a love
  of my own.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
( piano stops )

13:51.097 --> 13:54.234
I didn't say what bird.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.603
 Ooh.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.706
 Okay, next...

13:59.739 --> 14:01.908
 The Great Screechini.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.044
( music plays )

14:06.112 --> 14:08.081
   Thank you, Zack.

14:08.114 --> 14:12.686
 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
 to the wonderful
 world of magic.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.955
 And now allow me to present
 my wonderful assistant, Kevin.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.627
Kevin, you're
all dressed up.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.663
  I've got a date
  with Robocop's kid sister.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.966
  I'll do the jokes.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.769
  Hey, boss, I've got to blow
  my nose and I don't have
  a handkerchief.

14:29.803 --> 14:34.174
 -Can I borrow yours?
 -This is very unprofessional.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.610
   You'd better hurry it up!
   I feel
   a sneezing fit coming on.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.579
   Ah-ah...

14:39.612 --> 14:42.782
 ah-ah-tchoo!

14:42.816 --> 14:44.184
  Gesundheit!

14:44.217 --> 14:46.319
 Make that check
 payable to Zachary...

14:46.353 --> 14:48.788
  We'll see about that,
  Preppie.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.359
( fast rhythm playing )

15:15.815 --> 15:17.083
  What are you doing?

15:17.117 --> 15:19.285
 If a guy is going
 to win this pageant,

15:19.319 --> 15:20.754
 it's going to be me!

15:20.787 --> 15:22.822
   I'm in, Preppie.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.933
Face it, Zack,

15:33.967 --> 15:36.336
now that Slater's entered,
I don't stand a chance.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.138
You're wrong, Screech.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.306
  Take away his looks,
  his muscles

15:40.340 --> 15:42.108
   and his smile,
   and what's left?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.611
  Me?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.981
Slater never would have
entered this contest if
  it weren't for you.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.917
   Are you going to sit back
   and let him steal
   the credit you deserve?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.986
 Well, what can I do?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.523
 Get back in there and fight.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.291
-Oww!
-Oops.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.627
 Sorry, boss.
 I think I gave you a shiner.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.835
Oh, no.
Look at my eye.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.338
I'll never win
the beauty pageant now.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.340
   Oh yeah?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.542
That's what you think.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.080
  Hey, guys. Did you hear about
  Slater and Screech?

16:20.113 --> 16:22.048
   Yeah, they both did great
   at the talent rehearsal.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.851
  Oh, no. That's old news.
  I mean Screech's black eye.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.886
 Slater gave Screech
 a black eye?

16:26.920 --> 16:30.090
 You're kidding!
 Slater gave
 Screech a black eye?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.958
   Did you hear what Slater did
   to Screech last night?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.293
-What?
-What?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.961
  Slater dropped Screech
  off the roof of the school!

16:35.061 --> 16:37.597
 -No kidding!
 -No kidding!

16:37.630 --> 16:40.066
  Did you hear Screech was
  in surgery for eight hours?

16:40.066 --> 16:42.102
  I know. He's still
  in intensive care.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.071
 AC Slater should
 be locked up.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.307
  Did you hear Screech
  is on life-support?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.908
   Yeah,
   but the brave little guy

16:48.942 --> 16:50.443
still wants to compete
in the pageant.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.645
 If the hospital
 lets him out on time.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.081
  Both: Wow!

16:55.682 --> 16:57.617
  <i>Thank you.</i>

16:57.650 --> 17:00.620
   <i>And now, continuing with</i>
   <i>our swimsuit competition.</i>

17:00.653 --> 17:03.223
<i>Next up is</i>
<i>Jeannie Tyler.</i>

17:08.094 --> 17:10.063
   <i>Thank you,</i>
   <i>Jeannie.</i>

17:10.096 --> 17:13.098
  <i>Our next contestant</i>
  <i>is Kelly Kapowski.</i>

17:17.436 --> 17:19.439
   <i>Kelly's our</i>
   <i>head cheerleader.</i>

17:19.472 --> 17:22.409
 <i>She's used to leading cheers,</i>
 <i>but now she's receiving them.</i>

17:24.511 --> 17:26.512
<i>Thanks, Kelly.</i>

17:26.546 --> 17:30.150
   <i>Our next contestant</i>
   <i>is Jessie Spano.</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:36.089
Where is your swimsuit,
Jessie?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.525
 I don't believe
 a woman should be
 displayed like a side of beef.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.129
However, I am wearing
a swimsuit underneath,

17:43.163 --> 17:45.165
   and for those of you who
   enjoy that sort of thing,

17:45.198 --> 17:47.233
   it's blue
   with pink stripes, okay?

17:51.638 --> 17:55.975
<i>Next a different look</i>
<i>for this year's competition...</i>

17:56.076 --> 17:58.078
  <i>AC Slater!</i>

18:13.326 --> 18:16.296
 Gee, I wonder why
 they don't like him?

18:18.031 --> 18:19.499
 <i>Okay.</i>

18:19.532 --> 18:22.702
  <i>Thank you very much,</i>
  <i>AC Slater.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:30.210
<i>Next,</i>
<i>Samuel Powers,</i>

18:30.243 --> 18:32.712
  <i>better known to all</i>
  <i>of you as Screech!</i>

18:32.746 --> 18:34.447
 ( applause )

18:44.524 --> 18:46.559
I think they like him.

18:46.593 --> 18:50.530
 <i>All right,</i>
 <i>now for our finalists</i>
 <i>in the Miss Bayside Pageant.</i>

18:50.563 --> 18:52.599
  <i>The winner will</i>
  <i>go on to Sacramento</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:55.735
  <i>to compete for the title</i>
  <i>of Miss High</i>
  <i>School California.</i>

18:55.769 --> 18:58.705
<i>-Each girl...</i>
 -Ahem.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.374
<i>...or guy, will answer</i>
<i>one question</i>

19:01.408 --> 19:04.377
<i>and give her,</i>
<i>or his, answer.</i>

19:04.411 --> 19:06.346
<i>Are you ready,</i>
<i>Jeannie Tyler?</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:11.651
  <i>Yes.</i>
  <i>That was an easy question.</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:18.158
   <i>Well, thank you,</i>
   <i>Jeannie.</i>

19:18.191 --> 19:20.393
<i>Next,</i>
<i>Kelly Kapowski.</i>

19:25.398 --> 19:28.501
<i>Kelly, ''What do you think</i>
<i>we can do</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:31.705
   <i>to make this a more</i>
   <i>peaceful world?''</i>

19:31.738 --> 19:33.640
 <i>I don't think it's enough</i>
 <i>to believe in peace.</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:36.576
   <i>You have to cheer it along.</i>
   <i>Like...</i>

19:36.609 --> 19:39.446
  gimme a P-E-A-C-E!

19:39.479 --> 19:42.816
  P-E-A-C-E!
  Yay, peace!

19:44.617 --> 19:46.686
   <i>Thank you, Kelly.</i>

19:46.720 --> 19:48.555
  <i>Next, Lisa Turtle.</i>

19:52.692 --> 19:55.128
<i>''Do you think beauty pageants</i>
<i>are out of touch</i>

19:55.161 --> 19:57.664
   <i>with today's</i>
   <i>changing woman?''</i>

19:57.697 --> 20:00.533
   <i>No, I don't. I think beauty</i>
   <i>should be appreciated</i>

20:00.567 --> 20:03.370
 <i>wherever you can find it.</i>
 <i>There are so</i>
 <i>many terrible things</i>

20:03.403 --> 20:06.439
  <i>in the world today, why not</i>
  <i>have a pageant that</i>
  <i>makes you feel good?</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:11.144
   <i>Thank you, Lisa.</i>

20:11.177 --> 20:13.813
 <i>And now, for our final</i>
 <i>contestant for Miss Bayside,</i>

20:13.847 --> 20:17.751
<i>Miss...ter</i>
<i>Samuel Powers.</i>

20:21.888 --> 20:23.023
  <i>All right.</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:25.325
   <i>''What have you learned</i>
   <i>from competing</i>

20:25.358 --> 20:27.494
  <i>in the Miss Bayside</i>
  <i>Pageant?''</i>

20:31.631 --> 20:34.534
 <i>Well, I've learned that every</i>
 <i>geek can have his day.</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:36.903
   <i>Tonight, hundreds of my</i>
   <i>fellow students</i>
   <i>cheered for me.</i>

20:36.936 --> 20:39.305
   <i>I never felt so</i>
   <i>proud in my life.</i>

20:39.339 --> 20:41.508
  <i>But it's time for me to stop</i>
  <i>thinking about myself.</i>

20:42.375 --> 20:43.943
  I don't like this.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.413
  <i>If you choose me,</i>
  <i>there's no way Miss Bayside</i>

20:46.446 --> 20:48.848
 <i>could possibly win</i>
 <i>Miss High School California.</i>

20:48.882 --> 20:52.686
 <i>I mean any of these girls</i>
 <i>would be better.</i>

20:52.719 --> 20:56.289
  <i>So please,</i>
  <i>don't vote for me.</i>

20:59.492 --> 21:01.895
   Now that's inner beauty.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.731
   Don't listen to him,
   he's still on medication!

21:06.700 --> 21:09.235
<i>All right, this is</i>
<i>the big moment.</i>

21:09.803 --> 21:11.304
 <i>Good luck, everyone.</i>

21:12.806 --> 21:15.642
  <i>The new</i>
  <i>Miss Bayside is...</i>

   <i>the lovely,</i>

21:20.814 --> 21:22.482
   <i>Screech!</i>

21:28.922 --> 21:30.457
  I don't believe it.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.660
   I've lost
   to a teenage mutant dork?

21:38.698 --> 21:42.369
 Okay, well, here you go.
 Here's your 50 bucks.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.971
Keep your money.
It wasn't a fair fight.

21:45.005 --> 21:48.308
 I started a rumor that you
 gave Screech that black eye.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.811
 What? So that's why no one
 cheered for me then.

21:51.845 --> 21:53.980
   You wouldn't have won
   anyway. Besides,

21:54.014 --> 21:57.550
  have you ever seen a more
  beautiful Miss
  Bayside than that?

21:57.584 --> 21:59.452
Never.

22:00.854 --> 22:06.059
 <i>Say, isn't she...</i>
 <i>he charming?</i>

22:06.059 --> 22:09.229
   <i>Isn't he a pearl?</i>

22:10.764 --> 22:13.967
   <i>Lovely, disarming</i>

22:15.335 --> 22:18.304
<i>Not even a girl</i>

22:19.572 --> 22:22.942
  <i>He's bursting</i>
  <i>with beauty</i>

22:24.277 --> 22:27.714
 <i>And now it's my duty</i>

22:28.782 --> 22:32.752
 <i>To present to you with pride</i>
