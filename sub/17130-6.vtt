WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.404
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.573
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME,
GEORGE?

00:05.573 --> 00:07.875
NO. WHEN MY MOM AND I
HAD THAT FIGHT,

00:07.875 --> 00:09.643
I TOLD YOU ONE OF US
HAD TO GO,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.445
AND YOU TOOK HER SIDE.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.784
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.222
LOOK AT THE LACE.

00:21.222 --> 00:26.494
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU, HONEY?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.962
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN,
ANGIE.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.798
I MEAN, I HAD TO LEAVE
OUR OWN HOUSE

00:30.798 --> 00:31.799
AND GO LIVE WITH ERNIE.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.934
WELL, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.669
ANYTHING.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.939
(giggles)

00:38.939 --> 00:40.608
I HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND.

00:40.608 --> 00:44.044
REMEMBER OUR WEEKEND
AT THE LAKE?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.779
REMEMBER OUR SONG?

00:45.779 --> 00:49.317
(Tower of Power's "You're Still
A Young Man" playing)

01:03.831 --> 01:06.834
THAT TICKLES.
(laughs)

01:11.805 --> 01:13.774
AAH!
AAH!

01:16.710 --> 01:19.547
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

01:19.547 --> 01:20.948
I WAS DREAMIN'
ABOUT ANGIE, MAN!

01:20.948 --> 01:22.283
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?!

01:22.283 --> 01:26.454
I WAS DREAMING ABOUT
PLAYING FOR THE DODGERS!

01:26.454 --> 01:28.489
THEN WHY WERE YOU GIGGLING?!

01:28.489 --> 01:32.693
BECAUSE WE WON THE WORLD SERIES
AND WE WERE CELEBRATING!

01:38.932 --> 01:40.401
I'M SORRY.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.803
HEY, I KNOW THAT WAS
YOUR AND ANGIE'S SONG.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.838
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
WE JUST HAD A FIGHT.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.007
SHE DOESN'T GET THAT I CAN'T
LIVE WITH MY MOM ANYMORE,

01:47.007 --> 01:49.543
NOT IF SHE'S GONNA TREAT ME
LIKE CRAP IN MY OWN HOUSE.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.581
YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED
ANYBODY BRINGING YOU DOWN.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.217
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.686
OH, NO.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.921
NOT THE MOTIVATIONAL
TAPES AGAIN.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.490
IT'S MY MORNING RITUAL.

02:02.490 --> 02:06.093
(Man) YOU ARE A CONFIDENT,
HEALTHY MAN.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.196
WOMEN FIND YOU IRRESISTIBLE.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.964
I AM A CONFIDENT,
HEALTHY MAN.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.502
WOMEN FIND ME IRRESISTIBLE.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.069
DO YOU HAVE A TAPE
THAT MOTIVATES YOU

02:16.069 --> 02:17.805
TO WEAR A LONGER ROBE?

02:17.805 --> 02:21.509
'CAUSE I'M TIRED OF WAKIN' UP
TO THE FRUIT BASKET.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.953
MAX, BEFORE YOU GO,
CAN YOU TAKE THE TRASH OUT?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.422
THAT'S DAD'S JOB.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.924
WELL, YOU CAN DO IT
UNTIL HE COMES HOME.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.560
IF HE COMES HOME.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.528
MAX.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.766
THIS IS JUST TEMPORARY.
YOUR FATHER'S COMING HOME.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.403
YEAH? JIMMY PETERSON'S FATHER
SAID HE WAS LEAVING FOR A DAY

02:49.403 --> 02:50.904
AND HE NEVER CAME BACK.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.173
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
JIMMY'S DAD WENT TO SWEDEN,

02:53.173 --> 02:56.844
AND HE CAME BACK
AS JIMMY'S AUNT.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.781
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

03:00.781 --> 03:03.884
JUST CHECK OUT
THE GIANT BEAR CLAWS

03:03.884 --> 03:07.020
ON THE WOMAN WHO PICKS HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.558
BUT DAD SAID HE'S NOT COMING
BACK UNTIL GRANDMA LEAVES.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.925
IF WE CAN GET ALONG WITH HER,
WHY CAN'T HE?

03:11.925 --> 03:17.298
WELL, HONEY, SIT DOWN.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.766
WHEN YOUR GRANDMA MOVED IN,

03:18.766 --> 03:21.869
IT BROUGHT UP A LOT
OF OLD ISSUES WITH YOUR FATHER.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.106
HE HAD A REALLY TOUGH CHILDHOOD,
MAINLY BECAUSE OF YOUR GRANDMA--

03:26.106 --> 03:27.975
NOT JUDGING.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.643
NOT LISTENING.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.480
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.250
UNTIL YOUR DAD COMES HOME,

03:36.250 --> 03:37.918
YOU CAN BE THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE, HMM?

03:37.918 --> 03:41.822
OH, MOM, DON'T FORGET,
I'LL BE HOME LATE.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.691
WE'VE GOT THAT
FIELD TRIP TODAY.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.427
TO WHERE,
A STRIP CLUB?

03:49.463 --> 03:52.266
GO CHANGE.
YOU LOOK LIKE A SLUT.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.734
MAX!

03:57.170 --> 03:59.039
WHAT? I'M THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.509
THAT'S WHAT DAD WOULD SAY.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.279
SERIOUSLY, GO CHANGE.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.318
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:13.987 --> 04:15.656
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:15.656 --> 04:19.026
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:21.028 --> 04:22.396
* THE LOW RIDER

04:22.396 --> 04:25.866
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:37.945 --> 04:38.946
MORNING, MRS. CARDENAS.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.715
MORNING, GEORGIE.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.851
I MADE YOU SOME BREAKFAST,
GEORGE.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.560
JUICE BOX, CHOCOLATE CEREAL
AND CARTOONS.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.629
HEY, AFTER BREAKFAST,
YOU WANT TO RIDE OUR BIG WHEELS?

04:55.629 --> 04:59.900
WELL, I'D HAVE TO MOVE SOME
STUFF AROUND IN THE GARAGE,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.502
BUT, YEAH, OKAY.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.673
(Mrs. Cardenas)
WHERE'S MY BREAKFAST, ERNESTO?

05:05.673 --> 05:07.475
I'M MAKIN' IT NOW, MOM!

05:23.624 --> 05:27.395
HERE YOU GO, MOM.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.364
AY, I DROPPED MY SPOON.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.601
C-CAN YOU GET IT, ERNESTO?

05:36.336 --> 05:40.007
(laughs)

05:40.007 --> 05:41.842
GRACIAS, MIJO.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.013
(slurping)

05:49.249 --> 05:50.718
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.186
DON'T GIVE THAT CEREAL
A CHANCE TO GET SOGGY.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.088
DUDE, IT SAYS THERE'S
A TOY AIRPLANE IN HERE.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.356
DID YOU GET IT OUT?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.427
SHE'S GOING AT THAT BOWL
PRETTY FAST.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.928
OH, DON'T WORRY.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.896
IF IT'S NOT SALTY OR SUGARY,
SHE'LL SPIT IT OUT.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.868
(TV volume increases)

06:07.868 --> 06:09.637
(laughs)

06:11.304 --> 06:14.408
THAT CRAZY PEPE LE PEW.
NO!

06:18.679 --> 06:20.280
IS YOUR MOM ALL RIGHT?

06:20.280 --> 06:24.051
'CAUSE HER EYES JUST CLOSED
AND HER HEAD WENT DOWN.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.453
OH, YEAH, SHE LIKES
TO PRAY AFTER MEALS

06:25.453 --> 06:27.655
WHEN SHE HAS MORE ENERGY.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.392
SHE'S STILL PRAYING?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.962
NO. SHE'S SLEEPING NOW.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.066
HEY,

06:39.066 --> 06:41.034
AFTER WORK TODAY,
I'LL CLEAR OUT HALF MY CLOSET

06:41.034 --> 06:42.803
SO YOU CAN PUT YOUR SUITS
IN THERE.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.172
THANKS, BUT I WON'T BE HERE
THAT LONG.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.007
PRETTY SOON, MY MOM
WILL DRIVE ANGIE CRAZY

06:47.007 --> 06:48.976
AND SHE'LL BE BEGGING ME
TO MOVE BACK.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.712
WHAT IF IT TAKES LONGER
THAN YOU THINK?

06:51.712 --> 06:54.582
I DON'T CARE. LOOK, I THINK
I CAN TAKE LIVING HERE

06:54.582 --> 06:57.317
LONGER THAN ANGIE CAN TAKE
LIVING WITH MY MOM.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.552
(bell dings)

06:58.552 --> 07:00.654
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD,
I GOT IT!

07:00.654 --> 07:02.189
WHAT'S THAT BELL FOR?

07:02.189 --> 07:05.626
OH, SHE'S DONE EATING.
THAT'S HER BATHROOM BELL.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.799
I'M DONE EATING, TOO.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.204
TRAIN'S LEAVING EARLY
THIS MORNING.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.872
WANT TO GIVE ME A HAND?

07:18.872 --> 07:23.577
SORRY, BUT I LIKE TO PRAY
AFTER I EAT, TOO.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.651
THANK YOU.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.360
SO HOW'S LIFE
AT ERNIE'S?

07:40.360 --> 07:42.730
IF IT'S NOT WORK-RELATED,
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

07:42.730 --> 07:47.568
FINE. I'M JUST HERE BECAUSE
I NEED FOR YOU TO SIGN THIS.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.802
UGH.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.803
OHH...

07:49.803 --> 07:53.240
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BACK?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.843
ERNIE STEPPED OUT
FOR A MINUTE, THE BELL RANG

07:55.843 --> 07:59.613
AND I DIDN'T LIFT
WITH MY LEGS.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.916
THAT'S TOO BAD.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.718
WELL, I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME
AT YOUR HOUSE.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.286
GET BACK TO WORK, MOM.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.556
YEAH, I'M JUST SITTIN' AROUND
WITH MY FEET UP,

08:08.556 --> 08:11.592
LETTING ANGIE MAKE ALL
THE DECISIONS.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.993
I'VE TAKEN YOUR PLACE.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.295
WHY DON'T YOU FIND
ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.630
WHY SHOULD I?

08:16.630 --> 08:19.332
BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE!
I BOUGHT IT.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.501
AND IF I DON'T WANT YOU THERE,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.504
OH, THAT'S VERY PASSIONATE.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.006
DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT
LAST NIGHT

08:26.006 --> 08:28.742
WHEN YOU WERE SPOONING
WITH ERNIE?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.785
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

08:39.386 --> 08:43.023
BUT AT LEAST I CAN KEEP A MAN
IN MY BED. THAT'S RIGHT.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.697
WHEN ERNIE GETS UP
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

08:49.697 --> 08:53.066
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
HE COMES BACK.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.537
(telephone rings)

08:57.537 --> 08:59.206
HELLO.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.507
ANGIE!

09:00.507 --> 09:02.576
OH, TELL HER I CAN'T
TALK RIGHT NOW.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.511
I WILL CALL HER LATER.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.647
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.850
YEAH? OH, YEAH, SURE, BABY.
NO PROBLEM.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.853
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.755
I KNEW IT!
PACK YOUR BAGS, BAT!

09:16.523 --> 09:19.159
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.628
SHE WANTS ME TO COME HOME
TONIGHT.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.295
I KNEW SHE COULDN'T TAKE
LIVING WITH YOU.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.633
SHE CAN'T KICK ME OUT.
WHERE AM I GONNA STAY?

09:25.633 --> 09:26.800
HOW ABOUT THE ZOO?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.335
THEY'LL GIVE YOU
A BUCKET OF FOOD

09:28.335 --> 09:30.771
UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU ARE AND TAG YOUR EAR.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.305
IT'LL BE NICE.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.683
MAX! I'M HOME!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.484
DAD? ARE YOU HOME
FOR GOOD?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.019
YEP. FIGHT'S OVER.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.656
YOUR MOM CAVED AND SAID
SHE NEEDED ME, SO I WON.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.090
EXCUSE ME.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.294
BUT SHE SAYS WHEN
YOU GUYS FIGHT NOBODY WINS,

09:54.294 --> 09:56.630
'CAUSE YOU COULD BOTH
BE RIGHT IN YOUR OWN WAY.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.199
THAT THERE IS WHAT WE CALL
LOSER TALK.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.870
I'M BACK!

10:02.870 --> 10:05.906
WHO MISSED
THEIR DAILY DOSE OF VITAMIN "G"?

10:08.709 --> 10:11.211
I GET IT.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.813
YOU DON'T WANT TO HUG ME
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

10:12.813 --> 10:16.684
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP YOURSELF.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.618
YOU MISS THIS.
YOU NEED THIS.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.288
* YOU GOTTA,
GOTTA HAVE THIS! *

10:24.524 --> 10:29.596
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED-TO,
NEED-TO TELL YOURSELF.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.665
ARE YOU STAYING FOR DINNER?
I'LL SET YOU ANOTHER PLATE.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.167
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IF I'M STAYING FOR DINNER?

10:34.167 --> 10:38.171
THERE'S ALREADY
FOUR PLATES HERE.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.740
YEAH, ME, MAX,
CARMEN AND BENNY--

10:39.740 --> 10:41.341
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.644
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
KICKIN' MY MOM OUT.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.546
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED ME HOME.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.015
I DO.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.617
"CLEAN THE GUTTERS,
CHANGE THE FURNACE FILTER."

10:50.617 --> 10:52.285
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

10:52.285 --> 10:55.989
YOUR CHORES. THEY'VE BEEN PILING
UP SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.626
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, I MADE A STAND.

10:59.626 --> 11:03.563
ANGIE, YOU DON'T DO CHORES
ONCE YOU'VE MADE A STAND.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.234
YOU ARE STILL PART
OF THIS FAMILY,

11:07.234 --> 11:09.770
AND JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE BEING STUBBORN

11:09.770 --> 11:13.273
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T
HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.676
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO FORCE YOU
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ME OR MY MOM.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.278
IF I DO THESE CHORES,

11:18.278 --> 11:20.447
THE ONLY LEVERAGE I'LL HAVE
WOULD BE THE GOOD STUFF.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.448
WAIT FOR THE TWINS.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.017
WAAPAA!

11:26.119 --> 11:28.722
CIRCULAR. I'M GONNA PUT IT
IN REVERSE. WATCH OUT.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.791
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.460
HONEY,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.729
YOU KNOW I WANT YOU BACK.

11:35.729 --> 11:40.700
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS
AFTER THAT, BUT I DO.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.269
THEN WHY ARE YOU TAKING
HER SIDE?

11:42.269 --> 11:45.172
I'M NOT TAKING HER SIDE.
I WANT YOU HOME.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.075
THE ONLY THING KEEPING
YOU AWAY IS YOU.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.943
NO, THE ONLY THING KEEPING
ME AWAY

11:49.943 --> 11:51.311
IS THE WAY MY MOM TREATS ME.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.781
ANGIE, I CAN'T LIVE
WITH HER DISRESPECTING ME.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.849
WELL, IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ANY OF US,

11:55.849 --> 11:57.250
BUT HER HOUSE BURNT DOWN

11:57.250 --> 11:59.352
AND YOU KNOW SHE'S AFRAID
TO LIVE ALONE.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.454
YOU CAN'T JUST PUT HER OUT
ON THE STREET.

12:01.454 --> 12:08.495
THE BARS CLOSE AT 2.
THE SUN COMES UP AT 6.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.897
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
FOUR HOURS

12:09.897 --> 12:13.466
OF HER JUST FIGHTING OFF
WEIRDOS IN THE PARK.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.369
(sighs)

12:16.369 --> 12:20.941
GEORGE, YOUR MOM
IS GOING TO LIVE HERE.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.076
FINE, THEN I'M NOT.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.479
THEN I GUESS THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT TO TALK ABOUT.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.616
CARMEN, MAX, DINNER!

12:29.616 --> 12:31.518
FINE, THEN I'LL GO.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.553
YOU'RE LEAVING AGAIN?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.255
I THOUGHT YOU WON.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.058
I DID WIN. I'M JUST GOIN'
OVER TO ERNIE'S TO CELEBRATE

12:38.058 --> 12:40.393
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

12:50.804 --> 12:56.109
KEEP SMILING.
HE'S STILL WATCHING.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.677
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

12:57.677 --> 13:00.113
BECAUSE WE ARE
A HAPPY FAMILY,

13:00.113 --> 13:03.951
AND HE NEEDS TO SEE
WHAT HE'S MISSING OUT ON.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.553
MY CHEEKS HURT.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.588
(laughs loudly)

13:08.588 --> 13:10.958
DO IT.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.094
("You're Still
A Young Man" playing)

13:21.001 --> 13:25.338
MAN, I LOVE THAT SONG.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.958
OHH.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.795
DUDE,

13:48.795 --> 13:52.132
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
GET MY MOM OUT OF THE TUB.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.934
LISTEN,

13:53.934 --> 13:55.168
TELL HER
I'M SORRY, MAN.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.237
WHEN SHE SLIPPED,
I JUST REACHED OUT.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.975
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT I GRABBED.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.944
DUDE,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.145
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED,

14:05.145 --> 14:08.081
"OH, GROSS!
IT FEELS LIKE PUDDING!"

14:08.081 --> 14:09.782
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:09.782 --> 14:13.086
IF YOU'RE STILL HERE
NEXT WEEK,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.923
I'LL GET MY DAD
TO HELP ME WASH HER.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.224
THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.226
I PROBABLY WILL BE HERE
NEXT WEEK.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.860
HEY, DON'T TAKE IT SO HARD.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.996
MAN, ANGIE AND THE KIDS
WERE EATIN' DINNER, LAUGHING,

14:22.996 --> 14:24.364
HAVIN' A GOOD TIME.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.633
IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER
THAT I WASN'T THERE.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.803
HEY, GEORGE, I BET DEEP DOWN,
THEY MISS YOU.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.540
SURE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.811
HEY, I CAN'T HAVE
A SAD SACK IN HERE!

14:38.811 --> 14:42.315
READ THE SIGN!

14:42.315 --> 14:47.054
THAT'S RIGHT! BOOGIE TOWN!
POPULATION TWO!

14:48.221 --> 14:51.424
COME ON!

14:51.424 --> 14:53.360
HEY, I KNOW WHAT'LL
CHEER YOU UP.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.163
HERE'S A TAPE
FROM A LITTLE BAND

14:56.163 --> 14:59.933
I LIKE TO CALL
"DOS BAD ASSES."

14:59.933 --> 15:03.070
COME ON, ERNIE, I DON'T WANT
TO LISTEN TO OUR OLD BAND TAPES.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.039
AW, COME ON, GEORGE.
OUR DEMO ROCKED, MAN!

15:06.039 --> 15:08.208
"MEXI-CAT" WAS THE BEST SONG
WE EVER DID

15:08.208 --> 15:10.177
ABOUT A CAT IN HEAT.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.746
NO, SERIOUSLY, MAN,
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.216
(imitates cat meowing)

15:19.953 --> 15:22.722
HUH? YOU CAN'T
FIGHT IT, GEORGE!

15:22.722 --> 15:24.992
HERE IT COMES.
HERE IT COMES.

15:24.992 --> 15:28.195
COME ON, THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE WORDS.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.897
(imitates bass playing)

15:30.897 --> 15:32.165
* PUT YOUR TAIL
IN THE AIR *

15:32.165 --> 15:34.167
* AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE

15:34.167 --> 15:35.935
* 'CAUSE I'M A MEXI-CAT

15:35.935 --> 15:37.504
(imitates cat)

15:37.504 --> 15:40.107
* WHO YOU GONNA CALL
WHEN YOU WANNA GET PAWED *

15:40.107 --> 15:43.176
* MEXI-CAT!

15:43.176 --> 15:45.545
(knock on door)

15:45.545 --> 15:47.747
(Mr. Cardenas)
ERNIE, TURN IT DOWN!

15:47.747 --> 15:49.149
WE'RE TRYING TO SLEEP!

15:49.149 --> 15:52.185
DAD, IT'S ONLY
A QUARTER TO 10!

15:52.185 --> 15:55.122
YOU TOLD ME 10:00.
THAT WAS THE DEAL!

15:56.856 --> 15:58.358
I SAID TURN IT DOWN!

15:58.358 --> 15:59.592
NO!

15:59.592 --> 16:01.995
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

16:01.995 --> 16:05.332
YOU'RE SHOWING OFF
FOR YOUR LITTLE FRIEND!

16:05.332 --> 16:08.035
DON'T DO IT, MAN.
IT'S OKAY.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.170
YOU'RE THE MAYOR
OF BOOGIE TOWN.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.040
THAT'S RIGHT!

16:13.040 --> 16:14.574
(increases volume)

16:14.574 --> 16:17.244
ERNIE, DON'T MAKE ME
COME IN THERE!

16:17.244 --> 16:21.214
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE!
THIS IS MY ROOM!

16:21.214 --> 16:23.216
I'M TAKING AWAY
YOUR PHONE PRIVILEGES!

16:23.216 --> 16:27.254
I DON'T CARE!
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY TO CALL!

16:27.254 --> 16:30.323
GEORGE IS ALREADY HERE!

16:33.160 --> 16:37.597
(Mrs. Cardenas) GORDO!
LISTEN TO YOUR FATHER!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.099
TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!

16:39.099 --> 16:42.001
YOU HAVE UNTIL
I COUNT TO THREE!

16:42.001 --> 16:43.303
ONE...

16:43.303 --> 16:46.906
TWO...

16:46.906 --> 16:47.840
THREE!

16:47.840 --> 16:49.008
(volume decreases)

16:49.008 --> 16:53.012
(Mr. Cardenas)
NOW GO TO SLEEP!

16:53.012 --> 16:54.214
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS THIS BAD.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.948
YOU CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.985
WELL, I HATE IT SOMETIMES,
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:58.985 --> 17:01.288
HEY, BE A MAN!
MOVE OUT!

17:01.288 --> 17:03.456
YOU GOTTA GET
YOUR OWN APARTMENT!

17:03.456 --> 17:05.792
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON, LOOK.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.227
I JUST MOVED OUT OF MY HOUSE

17:07.227 --> 17:08.961
BECAUSE THE WAY
MY MOM WAS TREATING ME.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.198
YOU CAN DO THIS!
YEAH, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT,
ALL RIGHT?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.765
MY MOM NEEDS ME.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.268
MY DAD CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HER
BY HIMSELF.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.238
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW A LOT
ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY,

17:18.238 --> 17:21.208
BUT I KNOW
IT CAN'T BE HEALTHY FOR A MAN

17:21.208 --> 17:24.043
TO SEE HIS MOM NAKED
SO MUCH.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.217
YOU'VE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY
LIVING AT HOME.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.651
GET A NURSE TO HELP HER AROUND.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.121
A MALE ONE.
SOMEBODY THAT WORKS OUT.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.792
AND IT WOULDN'T HURT
IF HE HAD A FORKLIFT.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.628
IF I HAD MY OWN PLACE,

17:41.628 --> 17:44.264
I COULD PLAY MY MUSIC
WHENEVER I WANTED TO,

17:44.264 --> 17:45.832
WATCH MY OWN SHOWS,

17:45.832 --> 17:49.502
BE LOUD WHEN I GET FREAKY
WITH MY DATES!

17:49.502 --> 17:53.373
OH, AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
I WANT TO DATE.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.209
SO MOVE OUT! DO IT!
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.978
I NEVER LIVED
ON MY OWN BEFORE.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.713
I'LL HELP YOU
FIND AN APARTMENT.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.849
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME,
GEORGE?
ABSOLUTELY.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.318
I'LL EVEN STAY WITH YOU, BRO,
TILL YOU GET ON YOUR FEET.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.919
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.389
I'M GONNA DO IT.
I'M GONNA GET MY OWN PLACE!

18:09.389 --> 18:11.023
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, VATO.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.359
BE HARD!
YEAH!

18:12.359 --> 18:14.494
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA START RIGHT NOW!

18:14.494 --> 18:16.696
I'M GONNA TURN ON
SOME MUSIC!

18:16.696 --> 18:18.698
HEY, WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO,
KICK ME OUT?

18:18.698 --> 18:22.802
I'M GETTING MY OWN PLACE,
ANYWAY.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.605
THAT'S RIGHT, WE DO WHAT WE WANT
BECAUSE WE'RE MEN.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.640
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.012
('You're Still A Young Man"
playing)

18:33.012 --> 18:36.249
TURN IT OFF, MAN!
TURN IT OFF!

18:47.327 --> 18:49.396
THINK I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING, GEORGE?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.764
HELL, YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE LIVING HERE.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.666
HEY, DID YOU SEE THAT GIRL
BY THE POOL?

18:53.666 --> 18:56.903
YOU SHOULD GO DOWN THERE
AND TALK TO HER.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.338
THE ONE IN THE BIKINI?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.340
I DON'T STAND
A CHANCE WITH HER!

19:00.340 --> 19:01.841
NOT THE HOT ONE.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.277
THE PASTY ONE NEXT TO HER
WITH THE GIANT MOLE.

19:04.277 --> 19:09.081
OH, I DIDN'T SEE HER.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.419
I'LL UNPACK.
YOU GO TALK TO HER.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.753
I DON'T KNOW.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.055
I NEVER KNOW HOW TO
START A CONVERSATION.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.258
IT'S EASY.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.893
I'M ERNIE,
THE NEW STUD IN 2B!

19:23.563 --> 19:26.466
WAVE LIKE A MAN,
TWINKLE FINGERS!

19:28.968 --> 19:32.372
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU'RE
THE CREEPY GUY UPSTAIRS.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.173
MAYBE I SHOULD
CALL MY PARENTS.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.075
ERNIE, IT HASN'T EVEN
BEEN A DAY.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.378
I KNOW.
BUT IT DIDN'T END SO GOOD.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.813
AND MY DAD CALLED ME
AN UNGRATEFUL SON.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.315
AND MY MOM,

19:42.315 --> 19:44.684
SHE WAS SO HURT
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN ROLL OVER

19:44.684 --> 19:47.454
SO I COULD SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HER FACE.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.289
MAYBE SHE STARTED.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.091
MAYBE YOU LEFT
BEFORE SHE GOT AROUND.

19:52.091 --> 19:55.362
LOOK, GIVE THEM TIME, MAN.
THEY'LL GET OVER IT.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.697
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.733
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
IN MY LIFE.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.002
YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU GOT ME.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.405
WE'RE LIKE BROTHERS, MAN.
MORE THAN THAT.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.873
YOU AND I
ARE BLOOD BROTHERS.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.775
THAT'S A BOND
THAT NOTHING CAN BREAK.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.344
(cell phone rings)

20:11.344 --> 20:14.180
HELLO, ANGIE?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.416
OKAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.418
SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT MAX'S SCHOOL.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.753
HE'S ALL RIGHT,
BUT I GOTTA GO HOME.
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR SUITCASE?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.922
DUDE, IT'S MY SON!
I'M NOT COMING BACK!

20:22.922 --> 20:24.724
FAMILY'S ALL YOU GOT!

20:41.408 --> 20:44.544
(Man) YOU ARE A CONFIDENT,
HEALTHY MAN.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.747
WOMEN FIND YOU IRRESISTIBLE.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.250
I AM A CONFIDENT,
HEALTHY MAN.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.186
WOMEN FIND MEIRRESISTIBLE.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.656
YOU ARE A LEADER.

20:56.656 --> 21:00.427
YOU ARE A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.395
YOU ARE THE MASTER
OF YOUR OWN DESTINY.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.763
I AM A LEADER.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.733
I AM A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.369
I AM THE MASTER
OF MY OWN DESTINY.

21:09.369 --> 21:13.506
(George) YOU ARE A MAN
WHO NEEDS A LONGER ROBE

21:13.506 --> 21:15.274
AND LESS FRUIT BASKET.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.177
GEORGE?

21:18.177 --> 21:19.979
I'VE RECORDED OVER THIS TAPE

21:19.979 --> 21:28.355
BECAUSE I'M HIDING IN YOUR ROOM
AVOIDING BATHROOM DUTY.
