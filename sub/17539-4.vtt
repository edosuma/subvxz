This selfie is ruining my life!

00:20.479 --> 00:22.147
Hi? Can I help you?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.941
(gasps)
I mean...

00:23.941 --> 00:25.442
that looks great!
(laughs nervously)

00:25.442 --> 00:27.694
If by great,
you mean awful, then yes!

00:27.694 --> 00:29.238
‐It's great!
‐(phone chimes)

00:29.238 --> 00:31.531
Fantastic. Another comment.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.158
I am so sorry.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.826
I didn't even know
I could do magic.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.412
‐(gasps) I can do magic!
‐Yep.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.249
‐Jane: I can do magic!
‐You can do magic?

00:40.249 --> 00:41.416
We've been over this.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.709
I got to go lie down.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.170
Everyone is talking
about my cupcake disaster!

00:45.170 --> 00:46.255
Look at this post.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.091
Evie:
"Pastry chef?
More like pastry death!"

00:49.091 --> 00:51.343
I don't think that's
a compliment here.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.803
Does anyone know
how to knock?

00:52.803 --> 00:54.972
You're in a tent!
Hold on to this for me.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.598
Jay:
It's very important.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.267
‐(chuckles) Nice hair.
‐(gasps)

00:58.267 --> 00:59.726
‐Really?
‐Jay: Nope...

00:59.726 --> 01:01.270
but I'm trying
to learn how to be nice.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.481
‐You have to fix my hair!
‐Evie: Hold up.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.941
She's my BFF.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.277
‐Evie: She's helping me first.
‐(sighs)

01:08.277 --> 01:09.820
Hey, you stole my lamp!

01:09.820 --> 01:11.113
What? No!

01:11.113 --> 01:13.115
‐Thief!
‐Cool it, Jordan.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.033
Mal will help you
when she's done with me.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.910
I think you mean
when she's done with me.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.996
Did you get paint
on my lamp?

01:18.996 --> 01:21.206
No biggie.
I'll just wipe it off.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.958
Hello? My hair?

01:22.958 --> 01:25.335
Can we focus
on what's important‐‐ me?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.129
You're ruining my lamp!

01:27.129 --> 01:28.213
Gimme.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.717
Stuff like this never happened
on the Isle of the Lost.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.969
I wish we could all
just go back home.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.391
Hey, guys,
Jay got me a new phone!

01:39.391 --> 01:41.143
Where did everyone go?

01:41.143 --> 01:43.186
‐Oh, well.
