Felix, I just need help
with the gospel number.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.408
Why am I singing the phonebook?

00:17.409 --> 00:19.477
Because it's about emotion.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.545
A great singer should be
able to sing any lyrics

00:21.546 --> 00:23.214
and still move the listener to tears.

00:23.215 --> 00:25.916
Now, let's take it from A.C.
Ventner and Son's Towing,

00:43.268 --> 00:44.735
Oscar, Dani is the featured soloist

00:44.736 --> 00:46.060
in her church choir on Sunday,

00:46.061 --> 00:47.271
and I'm helping her get over her nerves

00:47.272 --> 00:48.506
with a little bit of coaching.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.773
You'll come and hear
Dani sing, won't you?

00:49.774 --> 00:51.308
- Mmm. Wouldn't miss it.
- Oh, great.

00:51.309 --> 00:52.776
It's Sunday at First Baptist Church.

00:52.777 --> 00:54.712
Mmm. I got a thing.

00:54.713 --> 00:56.280
Oscar!

00:56.281 --> 00:57.915
S... I just can't do the church thing.

00:57.916 --> 00:59.216
There's so many rules.

00:59.217 --> 01:01.285
Be nice. Don't sin.

01:01.286 --> 01:03.387
It's just... too much.

01:03.388 --> 01:05.022
Oscar. This is a big moment for Dani.

01:05.022 --> 01:08.225
I went to your laser tag birthday party.

01:08.226 --> 01:09.894
Okay. I'll go.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.562
And you do sound beautiful.

01:11.563 --> 01:13.553
Thank you. I just
hope I don't freeze up.

01:13.554 --> 01:14.231
Oh, you won't.

01:14.232 --> 01:15.873
- Just remember what I told you.
- Uh-huh.

01:15.874 --> 01:17.217
Look out at the crowd and imagine

01:17.218 --> 01:18.636
that they're in their underwear.

01:18.637 --> 01:20.204
Actually, if it's noon on a Sunday,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.250
you won't have to imagine,
just look at Oscar.

01:27.745 --> 01:30.281
I haven't been to
church in, like, forever.

01:30.282 --> 01:33.784
I don't know when to
stand, or kneel or jump,

01:33.785 --> 01:35.853
or anything like that.

01:35.854 --> 01:38.022
I don't think there's jumping.

01:38.023 --> 01:39.190
Well, this is a black church.

01:39.191 --> 01:42.159
Sometimes there's jumping.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.061
Thank you. I can't stop sweating.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.164
I know this is a place of God,
but the devil made these robes.

01:47.165 --> 01:49.700
- Dani. You are going to be just fine.
- Hmm?

01:49.701 --> 01:51.635
I'm just not a lead singer type.

01:51.636 --> 01:54.672
I'm not Diana Ross; I'm a Supreme.

01:54.673 --> 01:57.007
I always used to dream
about being in the spotlight

01:57.008 --> 01:58.342
when I was a young cellist.

01:58.343 --> 01:59.677
Alas, all the men of my family

01:59.678 --> 02:01.177
are cursed with infantum manos.

02:02.012 --> 02:03.180
Baby hands.

02:03.181 --> 02:04.949
Oh. I'm sorry.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.251
Oh. No. It's okay. There's
not a cookie jar built

02:07.252 --> 02:08.751
that's safe from these bad boys.

02:09.687 --> 02:11.922
But you, you have a gift.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.357
And you're about to
share it with the world.

02:13.358 --> 02:14.658
- Oh. Thank you, Felix.
- Hmm.

02:14.659 --> 02:16.099
I couldn't have done it without you.

02:16.123 --> 02:17.402
Oh, this isn't about me.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.226
This is about you having
your moment to shine.

02:19.227 --> 02:20.364
Speaking of which,

02:20.365 --> 02:22.628
you're gonna want to towel
off your forehead. It's, uh...

02:22.629 --> 02:25.029
Oh. Okay.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.172
- Good morning.
- Hi.

02:28.173 --> 02:31.809
- Hi.
- Ah.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.994
There's only one hymnal left.
Hey, do you mind sharing?

02:33.995 --> 02:35.712
I do not.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.816
Hey. Is that Michael Spencer?

02:38.817 --> 02:40.951
Oh, yeah, from the Braves.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.653
I interviewed him once after a game.

02:42.654 --> 02:43.988
He was in the shower.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.992
Not great for my self-esteem.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.894
Hey. Uh, I heard that
he was offered a TV show,

02:50.895 --> 02:52.135
and he's looking for a co-host.

02:52.136 --> 02:53.559
Oh. That would be such a sweet gig.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.132
I'd love another shot at TV.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.600
You should go and talk to him.

02:56.601 --> 02:58.736
No. I don't want to bother
him while he's in church.

02:58.737 --> 03:00.800
I heard your nemesis Rich
Eisen is circling the job.

03:00.801 --> 03:02.200
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

03:07.244 --> 03:09.780
Hello.

03:09.781 --> 03:11.682
Michael.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.050
- It's Oscar Madison.
- Hey.

03:13.051 --> 03:15.619
What's up, Oscar? It's
good to see you again.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.254
And this time I'm a lot less naked.

03:17.255 --> 03:20.506
Yes. A lot easier to
establish eye contact.

03:21.559 --> 03:23.093
I'm surprised to see you here.

03:23.094 --> 03:24.758
I didn't know you were
a church-going man.

03:24.759 --> 03:28.565
Oh, yeah. I go to church every...

03:28.566 --> 03:29.633
every...

03:29.634 --> 03:31.167
...time there's church.

04:24.589 --> 04:27.624
I felt the Spirit.
Your voice is amazing.

04:27.625 --> 04:28.792
Oh. Thank you, Raylene.

04:28.793 --> 04:30.393
I couldn't have done it without the help

04:30.417 --> 04:32.596
- of the Lord.
- Her friend, Felix.

04:32.597 --> 04:34.530
And also the Lord.

04:35.799 --> 04:37.034
Brava, Dani!

04:37.035 --> 04:38.469
I'm so proud of you.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.437
Oh. Your help meant so much, Felix.

04:40.438 --> 04:42.101
Oh, please. It doesn't
matter who did what

04:42.102 --> 04:44.141
or who was able to inspire
you to reach heights

04:44.142 --> 04:45.976
you never would have otherwise.

04:45.977 --> 04:48.112
- Ooh, Dani.
- Oh.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.546
You were amazing.

04:49.547 --> 04:50.714
I was literally crying.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.018
My favorite part was when you...

04:52.019 --> 04:53.884
you know, sang and stuff.

04:53.885 --> 04:56.052
Hey.

04:57.321 --> 04:59.390
Man, that was amazing.

04:59.391 --> 05:01.692
That guy gave such a great speech.

05:01.693 --> 05:03.460
Sermon.

05:03.461 --> 05:06.530
Fine. Sermon gave a great speech.

05:06.531 --> 05:08.065
Hey, Oscar.

05:08.066 --> 05:09.400
Me and a couple of my boys

05:09.401 --> 05:10.864
are getting together tomorrow night.

05:10.865 --> 05:12.703
It's gonna be a righteous time.

05:12.704 --> 05:13.837
You want to hang?

05:13.838 --> 05:15.706
Playoffs. Nice.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.275
I'd love to. How about
we do it at my place?

05:18.276 --> 05:19.710
That sounds great.

05:19.711 --> 05:21.979
Hey, fellas. My friend Oscar
said we could do Bible study

05:21.980 --> 05:24.113
at his place this week.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.552
That's right. It's gonna be fun.

05:28.553 --> 05:30.319
BYOB.

05:31.221 --> 05:33.223
Bring your own Bible.

05:41.665 --> 05:43.932
Dani, I hope that you're sitting down.

05:45.902 --> 05:47.671
I hope you can see that I am.

05:47.672 --> 05:50.407
I just talked to my friend who works at

05:50.408 --> 05:52.742
Good Evening New York with Rick Rovener,

05:52.743 --> 05:55.047
and I sent her the video of
your solo at church yesterday,

05:55.048 --> 05:56.012
and she loved it.

05:56.013 --> 05:57.580
She wants to book you and the choir

05:57.581 --> 05:59.348
for an upcoming segment on the show.

06:01.217 --> 06:03.720
This is your cue to jump up and hug me.

06:03.721 --> 06:05.889
Felix, I can't sing on TV.

06:05.890 --> 06:07.090
I can only sing at church

06:07.091 --> 06:08.691
because the people there can't judge me.

06:08.715 --> 06:11.261
You know, lest they be judged.

06:11.262 --> 06:12.762
This could be huge for you.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.064
Dani, think about it.

06:14.065 --> 06:19.568
Out of all of the people in
New York, God has chosen me...

06:21.071 --> 06:23.473
...to put you in front of the masses.

06:23.474 --> 06:24.808
It is humbling, really.

06:24.809 --> 06:26.176
Oh.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.577
If it's the Lord's will,

06:27.578 --> 06:29.412
- I can't really say no, can I?
- No.

06:29.413 --> 06:31.276
Plus, I already said yes
and I forged your name

06:31.277 --> 06:31.915
on some stuff.

06:31.916 --> 06:34.884
And I'll, I'll go tell the choir.

06:34.885 --> 06:37.287
- Can I get that hug now?
- Yes. Thank you.

06:37.288 --> 06:40.557
Oh. I'm gonna be singing about
the Lord's glory on television.

06:40.558 --> 06:42.726
My sister's gonna be so jealous.

06:42.727 --> 06:44.927
Suck it, Denise.

06:46.429 --> 06:48.765
All right, Teddy, quiz me
on the top ten commandments.

06:48.766 --> 06:51.134
Well, first, they're not the top ten.

06:51.135 --> 06:53.735
Then how did they get in the Bible?

06:56.940 --> 07:00.076
Oscar. I never thought I'd
see you reading the Good Book.

07:00.077 --> 07:01.878
Or a book.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.646
Very funny, Felix,

07:03.647 --> 07:06.983
but I have decided to
turn the other cheek.

07:06.984 --> 07:08.685
Oh, nice.

07:08.686 --> 07:10.920
Let's stay in that Bible zone.

07:10.921 --> 07:12.622
Oscar. Do you think that the Lord

07:12.623 --> 07:13.886
would approve of you pretending

07:13.887 --> 07:15.058
to be religious to get a job?

07:15.059 --> 07:19.229
Oh, right. Like God's perfect.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.598
Oscar. I'm going to need you to stay

07:21.599 --> 07:25.033
a lightning bolt's distance
away from me at all times.

07:28.905 --> 07:32.208
The New Testament?

07:32.209 --> 07:34.644
Hey, Oscar.

07:34.645 --> 07:38.248
Here's the, uh, Reuben from
Langford's that you ordered.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.781
I didn't order anything.

07:40.917 --> 07:43.486
And why do you look good?

07:43.487 --> 07:45.422
No reason.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.791
This is just something that
I threw on this morning.

07:47.792 --> 07:51.061
Oh. You're hoping to run into
your church buddy, aren't you?

07:51.062 --> 07:53.329
His name is Troy,

07:53.330 --> 07:55.432
and he said he would be here...

07:55.433 --> 07:57.300
on his Facebook page.

07:57.301 --> 08:00.103
Okay. Y-you've got to go.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.505
This is Bible study, not a booty call.

08:02.506 --> 08:04.808
Oh. Like you're so pious

08:04.809 --> 08:07.277
with your pornography lying around.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.279
It's the swimsuit issue.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.446
But good catch; I'll get rid of that.

08:24.327 --> 08:25.961
Welcome, brothers.

08:27.397 --> 08:30.100
I mean, religious brothers.

08:30.101 --> 08:33.336
You know, 'cause...

08:33.337 --> 08:35.504
Welcome.

08:38.374 --> 08:41.678
And finally, Lord, we ask

08:41.679 --> 08:45.281
that you send us into this
new week with your blessing,

08:45.282 --> 08:49.119
and your guidance that
we may do your good work.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.221
- Amen.
- Amen.

08:51.222 --> 08:52.988
Am... amen.

08:56.359 --> 08:57.760
Well, thanks for hosting, Oscar.

08:57.761 --> 09:01.030
Oh, hey. Mi casa es God casa.

09:02.466 --> 09:04.134
Hey, Oscar, I don't know if you heard,

09:04.135 --> 09:05.568
but I'm doing a TV show.

09:05.569 --> 09:08.338
What? Huh? Really?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.240
Would you have any interest
in being my co-host?

09:10.241 --> 09:11.473
Hell, yeah.

09:12.075 --> 09:15.410
Lujah.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.807
You know, Oscar, just
listening to your show,

09:18.808 --> 09:20.617
I would have never
thought that you were so...

09:20.618 --> 09:21.618
Religious?

09:21.619 --> 09:23.819
Well, I was gonna say "funny".

09:25.054 --> 09:27.390
But now I know the real you.

09:27.391 --> 09:29.459
And I think America should
get to know you, too.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.728
Wow. I'm... thank you, Michael.

09:31.729 --> 09:34.097
It's like some great powerful force

09:34.098 --> 09:38.000
wanted God to put you and I together.

09:39.736 --> 09:42.172
There's that funny again.

09:42.173 --> 09:44.707

10:06.763 --> 10:07.964
Okay.

10:07.965 --> 10:09.799
Dani.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.901
You were amazing, you lifted me up.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.770
The rest of you... okay.

10:15.873 --> 10:17.740
A couple of thoughts. Okay.

10:17.741 --> 10:19.209
First of all, right now, you all do

10:19.210 --> 10:21.744
a lot of singing,
okay. And it's powerful.

10:21.745 --> 10:24.347
But it's also just a
little bit expected.

10:24.348 --> 10:25.948
Just a little expected, don't you think?

10:25.972 --> 10:26.977
So here's what I think.

10:26.978 --> 10:28.785
We'll have Dani start it off.

10:28.786 --> 10:30.587
Okay? And then the rest of you

10:30.588 --> 10:32.989
will join in in the middle
for the-the "oohs", okay?

10:32.990 --> 10:35.592
And then we all join
together for the final chorus.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.594
Or...

10:37.595 --> 10:39.095
hear me out...

10:39.096 --> 10:42.365
we just let Dani take
it home all by herself.

10:42.366 --> 10:44.500
We're not a backup group.
We sing together, right?

10:45.703 --> 10:47.770
Okay. And here,

10:47.771 --> 10:49.439
here, that's great.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.075
But tomorrow you're going to be singing

10:52.076 --> 10:55.278
on Good Evening New
York with Rick Rovener!

10:55.279 --> 10:57.433
We don't care about being on TV.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.949
Well, that's fine. You don't have to be,

10:59.950 --> 11:02.252
because it's Dani's solo
that got you the spot.

11:02.253 --> 11:07.857
Are you gonna let this bow-tied
busybody talk to us this way?!

11:07.858 --> 11:10.460
You know, he-he did get us the booking,

11:10.461 --> 11:12.028
so maybe we should just hear him out?

11:12.029 --> 11:14.197
Oh. You're on his side.

11:14.198 --> 11:16.566
Well,

11:16.567 --> 11:18.635
we were singing good
before you got here,

11:18.636 --> 11:20.937
and we'll sing just as
good when you're gone.

11:21.805 --> 11:24.005
So it's gonna be like
that, huh, Raylene?

11:25.308 --> 11:27.110
I don't remember any TV producers

11:27.111 --> 11:30.747
knocking on your door before I got here.

11:30.748 --> 11:33.053
Hit the road, Jack.

11:33.054 --> 11:34.021
What'd you say?

11:34.022 --> 11:35.489
♪ Hit the road, Jack ♪

11:35.490 --> 11:37.224
♪ And don't you come back no more ♪

11:37.225 --> 11:39.626
♪ No more, no more, no more ♪

11:39.627 --> 11:41.762
- ♪ Hit the road, Jack, and don't
you come back ♪ - Felix, let's go.

11:41.763 --> 11:43.746
- ♪ No more ♪
- Boy, they really had that cued up.

11:43.747 --> 11:45.866
Mm.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.348
I don't think I can do another
one of these Bible study things.

11:48.349 --> 11:50.684
I mean, I got some weird
looks when I mentioned

11:50.685 --> 11:52.206
Noah of the Lost Ark.

11:52.207 --> 11:54.408
Just fake it until you sign the contract

11:54.409 --> 11:56.477
and the job is yours.

11:56.478 --> 11:58.212
Hey, Oscar.

11:58.213 --> 12:00.214
What's this about the job?

12:00.215 --> 12:03.650
It's pronounced "Jobe," Teddy.

12:03.651 --> 12:05.152
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey.

12:05.153 --> 12:07.221
Hey, Oscar, uh, you brought your agent?

12:07.222 --> 12:09.556
Well, who needs to read the
Bible more than an agent?

12:09.557 --> 12:11.023
Am I right?

12:11.892 --> 12:14.026
We're slime.

12:17.564 --> 12:21.601
Tell me, Oscar, um, how
many Gospels are there?

12:25.773 --> 12:28.575
I believe it was Jesus

12:28.576 --> 12:30.911
who said, "Number not

12:30.912 --> 12:33.047
"the Gospels,

12:33.048 --> 12:35.749
"because mine is the only true number,

12:35.750 --> 12:38.085
and that is good."

12:38.086 --> 12:41.187
And then I think he said, "Amen."

12:43.190 --> 12:45.793
Oh, look, it's, um, Brother...

12:45.794 --> 12:47.960
Teddy, don't, don't. Teddy, Ted...

12:50.764 --> 12:52.900
I'm really disappointed in you, Oscar.

12:52.901 --> 12:56.236
Pretending that you're religious
just to further your career.

12:56.237 --> 12:58.705
Obviously I can't work
with someone like that.

12:58.706 --> 13:00.307
I get it. That's a new low

13:00.308 --> 13:02.509
for even me.

13:02.510 --> 13:05.446
I'm a selfish, greedy bastard.

13:05.447 --> 13:08.382
And I just said "bastard" in church.

13:08.383 --> 13:10.517
Twice.

13:12.854 --> 13:14.855
Come on.

13:14.856 --> 13:17.524
You could really use Bible study.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.493
But instead of going in
with an ulterior motive,

13:19.494 --> 13:22.029
try it with an open heart.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.098
You're right. I'm in.

13:24.099 --> 13:28.100
I need to be open to this, not
get all Lady Crawley about it.

13:29.236 --> 13:30.904
It's a Downton Abbey thing.

13:30.905 --> 13:32.306
Oh.

13:32.307 --> 13:35.242
Because I'm black, I
don't know Downton Abbey?

13:35.243 --> 13:37.544
What? No, no...

13:37.545 --> 13:39.712
I'm just kidding with you, Oscar.

13:41.248 --> 13:43.250
♪ Do, re, mi, fa ♪

13:43.251 --> 13:45.385
- ♪ So, la, ti... ♪
- Stop. Stop.

13:45.386 --> 13:47.321
Stop singing.

13:47.322 --> 13:48.222
What now?

13:48.223 --> 13:49.464
You're getting a little pitchy.

13:49.465 --> 13:50.688
No, you're getting a little...

13:50.689 --> 13:52.748
Oh, you said "pitchy"?

13:54.061 --> 13:55.529
Why are you riding me so much?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.331
- Your friend said I was a star!
- Ah.

13:57.332 --> 14:00.067
"Could be a star." After
I'm done molding you.

14:00.068 --> 14:02.402
Do you think that little
Moshe Lipshitz from Yonkers

14:02.403 --> 14:05.037
just turned himself into
Rick Rovener overnight?

14:06.039 --> 14:07.541
Now let's take it again.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.176
I'm just about done taking it.

14:09.177 --> 14:11.778
Why don't you just focus on the booking

14:11.779 --> 14:13.847
and let me focus on the singing?

14:13.848 --> 14:15.315
If I hadn't focused on the singing,

14:15.316 --> 14:17.339
you would still be way in
the back row of the choir

14:17.340 --> 14:18.452
without a solo, so...

14:18.453 --> 14:21.288
I'm thinking about going solo right now.

14:21.289 --> 14:23.457
You already dropped the
choir, so... Oh, you're...

14:23.458 --> 14:24.925
Oh, she's talking about me.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.760
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

14:26.761 --> 14:28.896
You are so ungrateful!

14:28.897 --> 14:30.063
I made you!

14:30.064 --> 14:31.098
I'm leaving, Felix.

14:31.099 --> 14:32.432
Fine!

14:32.433 --> 14:33.867
Enjoy being a stripper!

14:33.868 --> 14:35.369
What?!

14:35.370 --> 14:37.871
It's from the movie musical Gypsy.

14:37.872 --> 14:39.740
Her mother was her manager
and then Gypsy's on the verge

14:39.741 --> 14:41.861
of becoming a star and then
her ego gets the better...

14:41.885 --> 14:43.085
Oh, Netflix it!

14:50.766 --> 14:54.436
Uh-oh, you're book-dusting.

14:54.437 --> 14:56.138
What's wrong?

14:56.139 --> 14:58.207
Dani and I had a fight.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.632
After everything I've done for her,

14:59.633 --> 15:01.468
she doesn't want me
at our TV appearance.

15:01.469 --> 15:03.403
Your TV appearance?

15:03.404 --> 15:05.505
Her TV appearance.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.040
Felix, you seem troubled.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.209
Like a sheep who's
strayed from the path,

15:09.210 --> 15:11.377
away from the flock.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.649
Oscar, are you experiencing
rare side effects

15:15.650 --> 15:17.484
and should you consult a doctor?

15:17.485 --> 15:19.086
No, I'm just sharing something

15:19.087 --> 15:21.421
that my new friends turned me on to,

15:21.422 --> 15:25.459
"Do nothing for selfish
ambition or conceit."

15:25.460 --> 15:27.327
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:27.328 --> 15:30.330
It's from the Bible.

15:30.331 --> 15:33.033
Fallopians.

15:33.034 --> 15:37.304
So you're saying I put my own
ego ahead of Dani's happiness.

15:37.305 --> 15:39.139
And did you say "Fallopians"?

15:39.140 --> 15:41.475
I did, my son.

15:41.476 --> 15:43.477
Yes, I suppose you're right.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.480
I was using Dani to try to
grab a bit of that spotlight

15:46.481 --> 15:48.482
that has always eluded me.

15:48.483 --> 15:50.951
In high school, I spent four
years as second chair cello,

15:50.952 --> 15:53.286
living in the shadow
of, first, Margaret Kim,

15:53.287 --> 15:55.122
then Will Turko, then Duane Foy,

15:55.123 --> 15:58.191
and then the other Margaret Kim.

15:58.192 --> 16:00.193
It's totally understandable, buddy.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.661
You were just using Dani

16:01.662 --> 16:04.064
the way I was using
Michael to get a job.

16:04.065 --> 16:07.134
But I ended up finding
something so much more.

16:07.135 --> 16:08.635
Grace.

16:08.636 --> 16:10.070
So this is just you now?

16:10.071 --> 16:12.672
I'm just as surprised as anyone.

16:12.673 --> 16:15.474
I have to go talk to Dani.

16:24.551 --> 16:29.355
Aw, my lost little lambs.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.325
Five minutes, Ms. Duncan.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.324
Thank you.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.549
And you only need the one mic?

16:34.550 --> 16:36.163
Yeah, it's, uh... it's just me.

16:36.164 --> 16:37.330
I'm all alone.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.964
A choir of one.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.036
Dear God,

16:43.037 --> 16:44.771
it's me, Dani.

16:44.772 --> 16:48.275
Duncan, New York City. I
know you got 1,000 Danis.

16:48.276 --> 16:51.344
Lord, I'm praying 'cause
I need forgiveness.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.613
I-I've committed the sin of-of pride.

16:53.614 --> 16:55.282
And I've alienated my friends,

16:55.283 --> 16:57.417
and now I got to go out
there and sing alone.

16:57.418 --> 17:00.220
I want to blame Felix,
but this is really on me,

17:00.221 --> 17:02.556
because I let it happen.

17:02.557 --> 17:05.025
Oh, please, God, please,
send the strength that I need

17:05.026 --> 17:07.093
to make it through
today. And I want to...

17:09.830 --> 17:13.532
Lord, are you calling me home?

17:16.037 --> 17:18.438
What are you guys doing here?

17:18.439 --> 17:20.942
I called them and explained that
none of this was your fault...

17:20.943 --> 17:21.615
it was all mine.

17:21.616 --> 17:22.776
Not surprisingly,

17:22.777 --> 17:24.377
they were very forgiving.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.512
Of Dani.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.114
Jury's still out on you, little man.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.884
Okay, Ms. Duncan, you're on.

17:30.885 --> 17:33.453
Correction, we're on.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.790
Love it!

17:43.698 --> 17:46.032
Oh! I'm sorry, I
touched somebody's boob.

17:48.169 --> 17:51.471
♪ Rock my soul in
the bosom of Abraham ♪

17:51.472 --> 17:54.608
♪ Oh, rock my soul ♪

17:54.609 --> 17:58.278

17:58.279 --> 18:04.751

18:06.554 --> 18:08.521
That was glorious.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.457
I got to say, Oscar, I'm impressed

18:10.458 --> 18:12.325
with how far you've
come in so little time.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.461
Yeah. I didn't even laugh
when they said "bosom."

18:15.763 --> 18:17.430
Thanks for being so nice to me

18:17.431 --> 18:20.133
- after I lied to you.
- Eh.

18:20.134 --> 18:21.935
It's like the Good book says, "Forgive

18:21.936 --> 18:23.470
and you will be forgiven."

18:23.471 --> 18:25.354
- "And you will be forgiven""
- "Be forgotten."

18:25.355 --> 18:27.274
I mean "forgiven." Um, I'm sorry.

18:27.275 --> 18:29.442
I thought we were doing a different one.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.878
I had the best time today.

18:31.879 --> 18:34.513
And thank you for escorting me to work.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.484
Oh. What a gentleman.

18:37.485 --> 18:39.619
Well, it is our third date.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.520
Mm.

18:40.521 --> 18:42.555
Bye.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.891
Oh, someone has a crush.

18:44.892 --> 18:47.027
Yes. Troy is amazing.

18:47.028 --> 18:49.029
He's respectful,

18:49.030 --> 18:51.731
he's spiritual, he's kind.

18:51.732 --> 18:53.533
It's just all the stuff you don't find

18:53.534 --> 18:54.868
in a guy these days.

18:54.869 --> 18:58.704
Oh, and, also, he's saving
himself for marriage.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.409
- You mean...?
- Yep.

19:02.410 --> 19:03.677
Okay, but you can still...

19:03.678 --> 19:04.577
Nope.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.179
- But what if you just...
- Uh-uh.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.081
So right now you must feel totally...

19:08.082 --> 19:09.683
Oh, yeah.

19:12.686 --> 19:14.721
It's Rich Eisen.

19:14.722 --> 19:16.089
You know Rich, right?

19:16.090 --> 19:18.892
Did I tell you I asked him to
be the co-host of my TV show?

19:18.893 --> 19:20.894
No, you didn't, Michael.

19:20.895 --> 19:23.363
But that's great.

19:23.364 --> 19:26.066
Yeah? 'Cause I know you
two were sort of rivals.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.534
Oh, no, that's the old me.

19:27.535 --> 19:29.002
I'm happy for him now.

19:29.003 --> 19:30.937
I think you two will make a great team.

19:30.938 --> 19:33.401
You know what, I do, too. You
know, 'cause we're so different.

19:33.402 --> 19:35.408
'Cause, like, I'm the
churchgoing goodie-goodie,

19:35.409 --> 19:37.344
and he's, like, the brash bad boy.

19:38.879 --> 19:40.479
I better call him back.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.184
I'm sorry, Oscar.

19:44.185 --> 19:48.188
Yeah. It is frustrating
not to get what you want.

19:48.189 --> 19:51.191
So... frustrating.

19:51.192 --> 19:52.592
Eh,

19:52.593 --> 19:54.394
it's okay. Clearly,
it wasn't meant to be.

19:54.395 --> 19:58.197
I mean, everything happens
for a reason, right?

20:00.100 --> 20:02.369
I'm proud of Oscar. He's really changed.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.237
He's done a lot of growing.

20:04.238 --> 20:05.238
- Yeah.
- Damn it!

20:05.239 --> 20:06.940
That is totally unfair!

20:06.941 --> 20:09.075
Thanks a lot, God!

20:09.076 --> 20:11.710
I devoted my entire week to you!

20:17.984 --> 20:22.788
You can add a paper towel
dispenser to my bill.
