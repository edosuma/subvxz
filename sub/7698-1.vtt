02:00.286 --> 02:02.955
You really can't get good help
these days.

02:07.668 --> 02:09.920
Phew!

02:16.677 --> 02:20.181
I understand your help
is the very best money can buy.

02:20.264 --> 02:22.850
You see, I'm the one who had you hired.

02:23.851 --> 02:25.811
Then I owe you something special.

02:26.145 --> 02:29.357
This particular assignment is one
from which I will derive

02:29.523 --> 02:33.778
-exquisite pleasure, Miss...
- Call me Candice.

02:34.403 --> 02:37.531
Call me Bane.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.331
Come on, boss. Hit it again.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.416
Again.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.673
Come on, boss. No wonder Batman's
running rings around you.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.642
Just can't get good help these days.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.186
So I have heard.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.730
Candice, when Jake here comes around,

03:10.064 --> 03:11.482
tell him he's fired.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.484
Now, let's do a little business,
Mr. Bane.

03:14.276 --> 03:18.989
They'll never pin it on me, but that
little fiasco cost me an easy $10 mil.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.784
You almost didn't get paid.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.121
You're lucky these diamonds
didn't get nabbed in the smuggling bust.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.377
No, Mr. Thorne,

03:32.336 --> 03:33.629
you're the lucky one.

03:37.925 --> 03:41.512
I'm making my secretary
available to you.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.807
She can provide any background
you might need on your target.

03:45.015 --> 03:46.976
My needs have already been met.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.691
I'm paying you to go after Batman,

03:54.150 --> 03:55.317
not Killer Croc.

03:55.484 --> 03:58.195
But the Batman will surely be
on the reptile's trail.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.281
I will observe the bat in action

04:00.448 --> 04:04.076
and when I understand how he thinks
and fights, I will break him.

04:04.326 --> 04:07.997
Now, where do I find this Killer Croc?

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
Load the truck. We'll get the safe.

05:10.559 --> 05:11.602
Batman.

05:17.274 --> 05:18.400
No time for this.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.708
Come on in, Batman. The water's fine.

06:23.924 --> 06:26.302
He is mine to destroy, monster.

06:26.468 --> 06:28.262
Over my dead body.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.639
As you wish.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.825
That's Croc.

06:59.251 --> 07:00.878
Somebody's helping us out.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.796
Somebody tough.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.725
He could be a crime-fighter, you know?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.853
Somebody trying to be like us,
trying to help us clean up Gotham.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.898
What do you think, Batman? Do you...

07:21.231 --> 07:22.316
What?

07:24.318 --> 07:26.487
I think you're right
about one thing, Robin.

07:26.987 --> 07:28.530
Whoever did this was tough.

07:28.697 --> 07:31.200
This was done with bare hands.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.474
- I didn't think you'd mind some company.

07:56.141 --> 07:57.893
Visiting hours are over.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.688
Hmm...

08:00.771 --> 08:03.107
How do these traction things work?

08:03.565 --> 08:06.777
When my bones heal,
I'll show you firsthand.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.321
Okay, okay.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.365
What do you want?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.783
Who did this, Croc?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.952
Why should I tell you?

08:15.869 --> 08:19.164
If you wanna suffer in silence,
that's fine by me.

08:22.918 --> 08:24.003
Ahhh!

08:24.086 --> 08:25.462
Okay, okay.

08:26.213 --> 08:27.423
He was huge.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.341
He had these tubes in his head.

08:29.758 --> 08:33.095
Pumped him up twice as big
right in front of my eyes.

08:34.888 --> 08:38.350
And he had an accent.
South American or something.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.644
See? That wasn't so hard.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.355
You'll know hard, Bats,

08:43.522 --> 08:47.901
once he sucks that juice into his brain
and snaps you in two.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.695
Don't bet on it, Killer.

08:50.195 --> 08:51.238
Later, gator.

09:03.917 --> 09:06.211
You seem to have a ding
in your door, sir.

09:06.628 --> 09:08.297
He trashed my car, Alfred.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.592
Between a couple of guys,
that's real personal.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.429
Nice to see you haven't lost your sense
of humor in the face of adversity.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.558
Something Croc said reminded me of
a Cuban prison experiment I heard about.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.853
Pefia Duro Prison, for Iifers only.

09:23.228 --> 09:25.981
- Then we're looking for an escapee?
- That's right.

09:26.356 --> 09:29.151
And there's only been
one escape in 25 years,

09:29.485 --> 09:30.611
three years ago.

09:32.905 --> 09:37.242
Computer, run background file
on Project Gilgamesh.

09:37.534 --> 09:39.369
Gilgamesh. Named after the warrior?

09:39.745 --> 09:41.038
The ultimate warrior.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.000
<i>A chemical plan to create super soldiers
out of hardened prisoners.</i>

09:45.167 --> 09:47.920
<i>It was abandoned when they got
more than they bargained for.</i>

09:48.128 --> 09:51.423
<i>- And what was that, sir?</i>
<i>- They got Bane.</i>

10:00.641 --> 10:01.683
After he escaped,

10:01.767 --> 10:04.478
Bane went into business for himself
as a freelance assassin.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.065
Price per job, $5 million.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.399
So, the question is,

10:09.566 --> 10:11.068
who wants to eliminate me?

10:11.527 --> 10:13.862
That line is forming
around the block, sir.

10:14.321 --> 10:15.906
Let me put it this way.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.075
Who has $5 million to spend?

10:26.041 --> 10:28.919
I have anticipated his every move.

10:29.211 --> 10:33.173
Very soon now, I will allow you
the pleasure of drawing the mask

10:33.257 --> 10:36.093
from Batman's decimated face.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.555
With Batman out of the way,
Gotham could be yours.

10:39.721 --> 10:41.056
So could I.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.225
And what about your employer?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.853
Well, accidents do happen.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.938
See you tonight.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.027
You're here late, Candice.

10:54.778 --> 10:56.280
Just leaving, Rupe.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.250
He's out there somewhere, Bane.

11:08.750 --> 11:12.087
Yes. Probably closer than we think.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.835
It is over

11:52.461 --> 11:53.670
before it begins.

11:53.962 --> 11:55.589
I think not.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.214
You have courage for one so small.

12:37.589 --> 12:39.591
You can yet be of use to me.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.996
I'd like to speak to you
about your new boyfriend.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.210
You've been stood up.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.878
He knew you'd come.

13:17.045 --> 13:18.714
He was obsessed with you in prison.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.882
He's read everything about you.

13:21.508 --> 13:24.052
He knows you better
than you know yourself.

13:25.512 --> 13:26.888
Bet it's for you.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.934
<i>I've been watching you, Batman.</i>

13:31.184 --> 13:32.894
<i>Were I a common sniper,</i>

13:32.978 --> 13:34.771
<i>you'd have never reached the phone.</i>

13:35.147 --> 13:36.606
What do you want, Bane?

13:36.898 --> 13:39.860
<i>Something more personal between foes.</i>

13:40.610 --> 13:42.821
<i>What do you value most, Batman?</i>

13:43.238 --> 13:44.614
<i>Perhaps I should say</i>

13:44.781 --> 13:46.825
<i>whom do you value most?</i>

13:50.203 --> 13:51.455
Robin.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.037
I want his mask, Bane.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.290
Patience. Soon you will have them both.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.649
Been nice hanging with you.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.337
Welcome to my arena, Batman.

15:24.756 --> 15:26.425
Prepare to meet your master.

16:33.408 --> 16:35.994
I will break you!

17:18.370 --> 17:20.121
My legs. Get the weights.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.250
Come here, sweetie.
I got something to discuss with you.

18:36.114 --> 18:40.952
Toys. You try to fight me
with pathetic little toys.

18:56.676 --> 18:58.553
You've got nothing.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.679
Beg for mercy.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.765
Scream my name!

19:02.474 --> 19:03.516
Never.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.394
You are beaten.

19:06.853 --> 19:08.980
Now I will break you.

19:12.525 --> 19:13.860
Huh?

19:15.737 --> 19:18.073
No! No! The venom!

19:18.156 --> 19:19.699
Can't stop it!

19:27.082 --> 19:31.503
No! Help me!

19:38.134 --> 19:39.761
You can't do this to me!

19:39.844 --> 19:41.721
I am invincible!

19:42.097 --> 19:44.224
I am Bane!

19:56.361 --> 19:57.570
Let her go.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.614
I know where she's headed.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.707
Is this the best you can
throw at me, Rupert?

20:16.840 --> 20:19.676
Go on, Candice, take his mask.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.886
Thought you might like
to hear this, Rupert.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.638
It's a new release.

20:24.305 --> 20:27.559
Maybe we'll call it,
"Better Luck Next Time."

20:27.726 --> 20:29.060
<i>With Batman out of the way,</i>

20:29.144 --> 20:30.437
<i>Gotham could be yours.</i>

20:31.146 --> 20:32.272
<i>So could I.</i>

20:32.439 --> 20:34.733
<i>And what about your employer?</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:37.318
<i>Well, accidents do happen.</i>

20:37.944 --> 20:39.821
Candice!
