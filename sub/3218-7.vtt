00:02.482 --> 00:05.317
Dad's gone now. He wants us
to pick up where he left off.

00:05.485 --> 00:08.106
We kill some evil sons of bitches
and we raise a little hell.

00:10.657 --> 00:12.067
Bela Talbot's her real name.

00:12.241 --> 00:14.400
A hunter?
Pretty far from a hunter.

00:14.577 --> 00:17.329
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

00:17.497 --> 00:19.039
- A thief.
- A great thief.

00:19.207 --> 00:20.998
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.575
- You're not gonna shoot anybody.
- Aah!

00:23.753 --> 00:25.295
Ever run across Gordon Walker?

00:25.463 --> 00:27.954
I know about Sam's visions.
I know everything.

00:32.552 --> 00:35.554
Gordon should be reaching
for the soap for the next few years.

00:35.723 --> 00:38.760
You were right about everything.
Sam Winchester is more than a monster.

00:38.935 --> 00:40.844
I'm not even sure he's human.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.764
We gotta get me the hell out of here.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

01:00.833 --> 01:02.375
It's rude to sneak up on people.

01:02.543 --> 01:04.037
Bela Talbot.

01:04.878 --> 01:08.579
You have me at a disadvantage.
I don't know who you are.

01:09.216 --> 01:10.497
Gordon Walker.

01:13.137 --> 01:14.880
I've heard of you.

01:17.433 --> 01:19.472
Heard you were in prison.

01:19.643 --> 01:22.561
- Got out.
- Released early on good behavior?

01:26.942 --> 01:28.021
Looking for this?

01:37.036 --> 01:39.277
I know you were
just in Massachusetts.

01:39.455 --> 01:43.203
And I know you were with
the Winchester boys.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.783
- Tell me where they are.
- I don't think I know.

01:45.961 --> 01:47.124
Oh.

01:47.296 --> 01:49.123
Why don't you think a little harder?

01:49.298 --> 01:53.758
Put that down. What's so pressing
about finding the boys, anyway?

01:53.927 --> 01:55.837
Sam Winchester is the Antichrist.

01:56.013 --> 01:57.127
Mm.

01:57.306 --> 01:59.097
- I'd heard something about that.
- It's true.

01:59.266 --> 02:01.935
From my good friend,
the Easter bunny.

02:02.102 --> 02:03.846
Who'd heard it from the tooth fairy.

02:04.688 --> 02:05.886
Are you off your meds?

02:06.065 --> 02:07.938
The world hangs in the balance.

02:08.108 --> 02:10.315
So you go ahead and be a smart-ass.

02:10.485 --> 02:13.155
Tell me where they are or I shoot.

02:13.322 --> 02:16.738
Gordon, you and I
don't know each other very well.

02:16.909 --> 02:19.151
So let me tell you
a little something about me.

02:19.328 --> 02:21.866
I don't respond well to threats.

02:22.039 --> 02:25.657
But you make me an offer, and I think
you'll find me highly cooperative.

02:26.919 --> 02:28.579
Okay.

02:28.837 --> 02:33.001
How about, you tell me where they are
or I kill you right now.

02:33.175 --> 02:36.129
Kill me.
Good luck finding Sam and Dean.

02:43.937 --> 02:46.344
I can wrangle up three grand.

02:47.190 --> 02:49.396
I don't get out of bed for three grand.

02:53.446 --> 02:56.696
Scratch that. Give me the mojo bag
and we'll call it even.

02:57.492 --> 03:00.279
Oh, hell, no.
This thing's a century old, it's...

03:00.453 --> 03:01.734
Priceless.

03:01.913 --> 03:04.202
Believe me, I know.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.748
Now, how badly
do you want the Winchesters?

03:20.432 --> 03:22.139
Hmm.

03:25.395 --> 03:27.387
Hello, Dean.

03:27.564 --> 03:29.556
Hey, where are you?

03:54.966 --> 03:58.086
Hey, hey. Don't worry, don't worry.
We're gonna call you some help, okay?

03:58.261 --> 04:00.218
Where is she? Where'd she go?

04:54.944 --> 04:58.147
Smell that? Come and get it!

05:01.408 --> 05:03.567
That's right. Come on.

05:03.744 --> 05:05.737
I smell good, don't I?

05:05.913 --> 05:07.952
I taste even better.

05:18.008 --> 05:20.250
Come on. Free lunch.

05:33.357 --> 05:34.436
Whoo!

05:38.946 --> 05:40.405
What?

05:40.906 --> 05:42.733
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

05:42.908 --> 05:46.028
Ah. I was just chumming the water.

05:46.203 --> 05:48.077
Worked, didn't it?

05:50.082 --> 05:52.655
Oh.

06:21.323 --> 06:23.280
You with us?

06:24.075 --> 06:26.993
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, you're not going anywhere.

06:27.162 --> 06:28.704
- Wha...?
- Where's your nest?

06:28.872 --> 06:30.995
- What?
- Your nest.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.040
Where you and your
bloodsucking pals hang out?

06:33.210 --> 06:35.747
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.830
Please, I don't feel good.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.631
Yeah, well.

06:39.799 --> 06:43.334
You're gonna feel worse, we give you
another shot of Dead Man's Blood.

06:44.095 --> 06:45.755
- Just let me go.
- Ha.

06:45.931 --> 06:48.682
- Yeah, you know we can't do that.
- I'm telling you the truth.

06:48.850 --> 06:51.341
I'm just... I took something.

06:51.519 --> 06:55.932
I'm freaking out,
I don't know what's going on.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.060
You took something?
- Yes.

07:02.072 --> 07:05.986
I can't come down.

07:06.618 --> 07:08.361
I just wanna come down.

07:09.621 --> 07:12.159
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

07:12.332 --> 07:16.745
- Please, just let me go.
- All right, Lucy, how about this?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.829
If you tell us what happened...

07:19.965 --> 07:21.507
...we'll let you go.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.706
You will?

07:26.263 --> 07:27.805
Uh...

07:27.973 --> 07:29.171
I don't really...

07:29.349 --> 07:30.629
Um...

07:30.809 --> 07:32.801
It's... It's not that clear.

07:32.978 --> 07:36.062
- Uh, I was at Spider.
- Spider?

07:36.231 --> 07:37.808
The club, on Jefferson.

07:37.983 --> 07:40.438
And there was this guy,
he was buying me drinks.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.686
This guy. What's he look like?

07:44.572 --> 07:46.566
Uh, he was old, like, 30.

07:46.742 --> 07:50.657
He had brown hair, a leather jacket.

07:51.330 --> 07:53.702
Deacon or Dixon or something.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.457
Said he was a dealer,
he had something for me.

07:59.463 --> 08:01.088
- Something?
Something new.

08:02.466 --> 08:04.459
Better than anything you ever tried.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.714
He put a few drops in my drink.

08:11.684 --> 08:14.222
Ha. Was the drug red and thick?

08:17.356 --> 08:19.764
Well, genius move there.

08:20.359 --> 08:22.850
- That was vampire blood.
- What?

08:23.029 --> 08:25.401
You just took a big steaming shot
of the nastiest virus.

08:25.573 --> 08:29.701
You're crazy,
he gave me roofies or something.

08:29.869 --> 08:33.616
No. The next thing I know,
we're at his place...

08:33.789 --> 08:37.241
...and he says he's gonna
get me something to eat, just wait.

08:37.418 --> 08:41.202
But I get so hungry.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.621
- So you busted out?
- Yeah.

08:45.468 --> 08:48.089
But it won't wear off...

08:48.888 --> 08:50.797
...whatever he gave me.

08:52.141 --> 08:55.012
Lights too bright?
Sunshine hurts your skin?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.515
Yeah.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.138
And smells.

09:03.527 --> 09:08.154
And I can hear blood pumping.

09:08.324 --> 09:12.535
Well, I hate to tell you this, sweetheart,
but your blood's never pumping again.

09:13.371 --> 09:14.651
Not mine.

09:15.247 --> 09:17.157
Yours.

09:18.668 --> 09:23.080
I can hear a heart beating
from half a block away.

09:25.383 --> 09:27.541
I just want it to stop.

09:29.137 --> 09:31.889
All right, listen, Wavy Gravy.

09:32.307 --> 09:34.763
It's not going to stop.

09:34.935 --> 09:37.687
You've already killed two people,
almost three.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.603
No, I couldn't.

09:40.816 --> 09:42.191
I was hallucinating.

09:42.359 --> 09:45.728
You killed them. We've been following
a sloppy trail of corpses.

09:45.904 --> 09:47.446
- And it leads straight to you.
- No.

09:47.614 --> 09:50.283
No, it wasn't real.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.324
It was the drug.

09:53.286 --> 09:54.864
Please.

09:57.207 --> 09:59.745
Please, you have to help me.

10:03.296 --> 10:05.622
No, no.

10:12.931 --> 10:14.010
Poor girl.

10:14.182 --> 10:15.760
We don't have a choice.

10:26.695 --> 10:28.403
No.

10:29.197 --> 10:30.442
Please. Aah!

10:48.508 --> 10:51.545
Sir. A few questions about the attack.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.425
- I already talked to the cops.
- Well, we're not cops.

10:54.598 --> 10:56.637
- We're FBI.
- FBI?

10:56.808 --> 10:59.097
- Can you describe your attacker?
- Uh...

11:01.605 --> 11:05.768
She was crazy. She had that, uh,
super PCP strength, you know?

11:06.401 --> 11:08.228
She gnawed on my neck.

11:08.403 --> 11:09.434
Did she bleed on you?

11:10.280 --> 11:13.068
- On me? No.
- In your mouth, open wound, anything?

11:13.242 --> 11:14.274
You sure about that?

11:14.452 --> 11:17.369
- Yeah, I'm sure. Why do you ask?
- This woman has a dangerous virus.

11:17.538 --> 11:18.653
What?

11:18.831 --> 11:20.160
S- She bit me in the neck.

11:20.333 --> 11:24.117
The bite doesn't matter. You have to
actually ingest the blood to be infected.

11:24.295 --> 11:26.122
- Oh.
- Good thing too.

11:26.297 --> 11:27.626
We'd have had to kill you.

11:27.799 --> 11:29.507
Ha.

11:34.639 --> 11:37.344
- The attack?
- She jumped me, then bit me.

11:37.517 --> 11:40.387
And then those two guys found me,
and, uh, chased her down the alley.

11:40.561 --> 11:42.684
- What did they look like?
- I didn't get a good look.

11:42.855 --> 11:43.887
Think.

11:45.274 --> 11:47.563
One of them was real tall.

11:53.241 --> 11:54.735
That was a big fat waste of time.

11:54.909 --> 11:56.617
Ah. Look.

11:56.786 --> 11:59.028
Three blonds have gone missing,
including Lucy.

11:59.205 --> 12:01.114
All last sighted here.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.618
I'm telling you, Dean,
this is the hunting ground.

12:04.794 --> 12:06.253
Hey.

12:12.135 --> 12:14.542
Ha, ha. You're sick.

12:15.513 --> 12:17.506
You ready, sweetie?

12:18.516 --> 12:20.722
One taste of this,
you'll never be the same.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.896
Get out of here. Go, go.

12:30.611 --> 12:32.070
- Dean.
- Aah.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.522
I'm good. Come on.

13:03.603 --> 13:05.263
All right, run, I'll draw them off.

13:05.439 --> 13:07.846
What? No, you're crazy.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.874
There you are.

14:09.127 --> 14:12.164
Yeah, sorry. I stopped for a slice.

14:12.339 --> 14:15.708
Nice move you pulled back there, Dean,
running right at the weapons.

14:15.884 --> 14:17.259
Well, what can I say?

14:17.427 --> 14:19.420
I'm a badass.

14:20.514 --> 14:22.257
So I guess Gordon's out of jail.

14:22.432 --> 14:26.050
Uh, yeah, I guess so. You know, how
the hell did he know where to find us?

14:27.896 --> 14:29.271
That bitch.

14:32.943 --> 14:34.770
<i>Hi, Bela.
- Hello, Dean.</i>

14:34.945 --> 14:35.976
<i>Question for you.</i>

14:36.154 --> 14:39.773
You called me yesterday. It wasn't
to thank me for saving your ass, was it?

14:39.951 --> 14:42.489
No. Gordon Walker paid me
to tell him where you were.

14:42.662 --> 14:43.776
<i>Excuse me?</i>

14:43.955 --> 14:45.366
Well, he had a gun on me.

14:45.540 --> 14:48.457
<i>- What else was I supposed to do?
- I don't know, pick up the phone.</i>

14:48.626 --> 14:51.034
Tell us that a raging psychopath
was dropping by?

14:51.212 --> 14:54.830
- I did intend to call. I got sidetracked.
- He tried to kill us!

14:55.007 --> 14:57.380
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was such a big deal.

14:57.885 --> 15:00.590
<i>After all, there are two of you
and one of him.</i>

15:00.763 --> 15:03.052
- There were two of them.
- Oh.

15:03.224 --> 15:05.762
<i>Bela, if we make it out of this alive...</i>

15:05.935 --> 15:07.892
...the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you.

15:08.062 --> 15:10.102
<i>- You're not serious.
- Listen to my voice...</i>

15:10.273 --> 15:12.515
...and tell me if I'm serious.

15:53.649 --> 15:56.437
- I know you're uncomfortable...
- Aah.

15:56.611 --> 15:59.102
...but this is just temporary.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.151
The hunger will pass
and then you'll feel much better.

16:02.325 --> 16:04.732
Mm. Ah.

16:06.579 --> 16:07.610
You're awake.

16:07.788 --> 16:10.493
Who are they?
- Family.

16:10.666 --> 16:13.288
You always keep your family
in shackles?

16:13.461 --> 16:15.786
We're still getting to know each other.

16:15.963 --> 16:17.422
They've just been reborn.

16:17.590 --> 16:19.499
You grabbed some poor girls
off the street...

16:19.675 --> 16:22.880
...and made them monsters like you?
- I do what I have to.

16:23.055 --> 16:24.335
We're a dying breed.

16:26.141 --> 16:29.925
But then, you know that,
don't you, Gordon?

16:30.354 --> 16:33.308
Gordon Walker.

16:34.191 --> 16:37.275
One of the greatest living
vampire hunters.

16:38.570 --> 16:39.981
In the flesh.

16:40.155 --> 16:42.860
You're a big part of why my people
are nearly extinct, Gordon.

16:45.244 --> 16:47.865
Your people are going extinct...

16:48.038 --> 16:50.992
...because you're a bunch of mindless,
bloodthirsty animals.

16:54.628 --> 16:59.623
Right, we're so much more
bloodthirsty than you.

16:59.842 --> 17:04.053
Hunters slaughtered my entire nest
like they were having a party.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.467
Murdered my daughter.

17:07.641 --> 17:10.558
I can't tell you how satisfying this is.

17:10.727 --> 17:13.763
Catching a hunter
responsible for so many deaths...

17:13.939 --> 17:17.355
...and making you lunch
for my new daughters.

17:19.528 --> 17:21.520
Daughters?

17:23.031 --> 17:25.070
Try fang-whores.

17:26.577 --> 17:30.277
- Watch your mouth.
- Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

17:30.455 --> 17:31.784
I'm sorry.

17:31.957 --> 17:35.077
I forgot,
you're just a misunderstood victim.

17:35.252 --> 17:40.246
Even though you murder and spread
your filthy disease on pure base instinct.

17:40.424 --> 17:42.915
You got less humanity
than a sewer rat.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.928
I'm sorry you have such a low opinion
of my people.

17:46.096 --> 17:48.883
Oh, you have no idea.

17:52.728 --> 17:55.894
Sorry, change of plans.

17:56.064 --> 17:58.686
I'll be going out to get you lunch.

17:59.151 --> 18:01.190
I've got a better idea for you.

18:09.871 --> 18:10.986
No.

18:11.998 --> 18:13.741
No.

18:17.253 --> 18:18.997
No.

18:19.172 --> 18:20.500
No!

18:25.470 --> 18:28.008
That vampire's still out there, Dean.

18:28.181 --> 18:30.304
First things first.

18:31.017 --> 18:32.891
- Gordon.
- About that.

18:33.061 --> 18:35.267
- When we find him or if he finds us...
- Yeah?

18:35.438 --> 18:39.187
- I'm saying. He's not leaving us options.
- Yeah, I know. We gotta kill him.

18:40.860 --> 18:43.731
Really? Just like that?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.482
I thought you would've been, like:

18:45.657 --> 18:48.444
"No, we can't,
he's a human, it's wrong. "

18:48.618 --> 18:50.242
No, I'm done.

18:50.411 --> 18:52.902
I mean, Gordon's not gonna stop
until we're dead.

18:54.332 --> 18:56.075
Or until he is.

19:01.339 --> 19:02.667
<i>- What?
I don't like it...</i>

19:02.840 --> 19:06.044
...when people hold grudges against me.
I'd rather you didn't kill me.

19:06.219 --> 19:08.295
<i>So I went ahead
and found Gordon's exact location.</i>

19:08.471 --> 19:10.511
<i>- You're hundred miles away. How...?
- Hello.</i>

19:10.682 --> 19:12.721
Purveyor of powerful occult objects.

19:12.892 --> 19:15.217
I used a talking board
to contact the other side.

19:15.395 --> 19:16.426
<i>- And?
- Warehouse.</i>

19:16.604 --> 19:19.356
Two stories, riverfront,
neon sign outside.

19:19.524 --> 19:20.555
<i>- Thanks.
- One more thing.</i>

19:20.733 --> 19:21.978
The spirit had a message.

19:22.151 --> 19:24.358
<i>"Leave town, run like hell,
and whatever you do...</i>

19:24.529 --> 19:26.189
...don't go after Gordon. "

19:26.364 --> 19:28.440
<i>For whatever that's worth.</i>

20:27.635 --> 20:29.295
Please.

20:29.637 --> 20:32.174
Help us. Please.

22:42.187 --> 22:43.930
Go ahead.

22:44.647 --> 22:46.142
Do it.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.394
Kill me.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.780
- What happened here?
- Gordon Walker.

22:56.367 --> 22:59.155
I never should have brought
a hunter here.

22:59.370 --> 23:01.944
Never. I just...

23:02.832 --> 23:04.908
I just wanted some kind of revenge.

23:05.085 --> 23:09.034
So stupid, exposing him my family.

23:09.214 --> 23:10.791
Oh, yeah, you're such a family man.

23:16.430 --> 23:18.968
- You don't understand.
- I don't wanna understand, you...

23:19.141 --> 23:21.098
I was desperate.

23:21.727 --> 23:23.269
Have you ever felt desperate?

23:25.147 --> 23:27.769
I've lost everyone I ever loved.

23:27.942 --> 23:31.108
I'm staring down eternity, alone.

23:32.238 --> 23:34.147
Can you think of a worse hell?

23:35.408 --> 23:37.151
Well, there's hell.

23:39.662 --> 23:41.785
I wasn't thinking.

23:42.706 --> 23:44.331
I just...

23:44.917 --> 23:45.996
I didn't care anymore.

23:48.045 --> 23:49.623
Do you know what that's like?

23:51.173 --> 23:53.499
When you just don't give a damn?

23:54.135 --> 23:55.759
It's like...

23:56.137 --> 23:58.094
It's like being dead already.

23:59.557 --> 24:01.929
So just go ahead.

24:03.102 --> 24:04.133
Do it.

24:07.398 --> 24:09.106
Dean.

24:11.026 --> 24:13.600
Head wasn't cut off,
it was ripped off.

24:15.114 --> 24:17.569
By someone's bare hands.

24:17.741 --> 24:19.319
Dixon?

24:20.327 --> 24:23.032
What did you do to Gordon?

24:48.147 --> 24:49.807
Gordon.

24:53.819 --> 24:54.982
You okay?

24:56.615 --> 24:57.777
Not even close.

24:57.949 --> 24:59.527
I thought maybe you were dead.

25:03.497 --> 25:05.074
What is it?

25:07.125 --> 25:09.960
Something happened.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.411
What?

25:15.509 --> 25:17.501
They turned me.

25:18.011 --> 25:20.300
They? Those fangs?

25:24.893 --> 25:27.135
I'm sorry.

25:29.523 --> 25:30.933
You know what this means?

25:34.152 --> 25:35.777
It means you have to kill me.

25:41.034 --> 25:42.659
But not yet.

25:42.828 --> 25:44.203
What do you mean?

25:44.371 --> 25:46.826
You have to let me
do one last thing first.

25:48.166 --> 25:50.657
- What?
- Kill Sam Winchester.

25:50.836 --> 25:52.378
- Gordon...
- It's the only...

25:52.546 --> 25:55.796
It is the one good thing
to come out of this nightmare.

25:56.842 --> 25:59.878
I'm stronger, I'm faster.
I can finish him.

26:01.513 --> 26:03.137
Gordon...

26:03.306 --> 26:04.765
...I'm sorry.

26:06.059 --> 26:09.309
You know I can't let you
walk out of here.

26:09.479 --> 26:13.940
Listen to me.
There is nothing more important.

26:15.110 --> 26:16.141
Please.

26:27.205 --> 26:30.242
I can do one last good thing
for the world.

26:33.128 --> 26:34.622
Yeah.

26:35.505 --> 26:37.165
I hear you.

26:40.052 --> 26:42.543
You know, Gordon...

26:43.723 --> 26:44.837
...you're right.

26:45.016 --> 26:48.467
One last good thing.

27:06.746 --> 27:08.785
I'm sorry.

27:23.638 --> 27:27.718
Man, I must have checked three dozen
motels, empty buildings, warehouses.

27:27.892 --> 27:30.050
Yeah, me too.

27:30.895 --> 27:32.934
- Big city.
- It's like a giant haystack.

27:33.105 --> 27:35.810
Gordon's a deadly needle.

27:37.693 --> 27:40.813
We're running out of daylight.
Without the sun slowing him down...

27:40.988 --> 27:43.526
- Yeah, he'll be unstoppable.
- Yeah.

27:43.866 --> 27:45.942
Hey, uh, give me your phone.

27:46.118 --> 27:49.452
- What for?
- Lf Gordon knows our cell numbers...

27:49.622 --> 27:52.623
...he can use the cell signal
to track us down.

27:53.084 --> 27:54.329
Oh, yeah.

27:54.502 --> 27:56.578
- Nice.
- Yeah.

28:02.551 --> 28:04.425
Sam, stay here.

28:05.263 --> 28:08.133
What? Where are you going now?

28:09.225 --> 28:10.423
I'm going after Gordon.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.388
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me.

28:13.562 --> 28:15.769
Well, not alone, you're not.

28:15.940 --> 28:17.979
Sam, I don't need
a permission slip, okay?

28:18.150 --> 28:20.986
He's after you, not me,
and he's turbocharged.

28:21.153 --> 28:23.645
I want you to stay out of harm's way.
I'll take care of it.

28:23.824 --> 28:26.493
Dean, you're not going by yourself.
You're gonna get killed.

28:26.660 --> 28:29.863
Just another day at the office.
A massively dangerous day at the office.

28:30.038 --> 28:32.790
So, uh, you're the guy with nothing
to lose now? Oh, let me guess.

28:32.958 --> 28:34.121
Because, uh...

28:34.293 --> 28:36.962
- It's because you're already dead.
- Lf the shoe fits.

28:37.129 --> 28:39.584
You know, I'm sick and tired
of your stupid kamikaze trip.

28:39.756 --> 28:42.212
Whoa, whoa. Kamikaze?

28:42.384 --> 28:44.424
- I'm more like a ninja.
- That's not funny.

28:44.595 --> 28:46.255
- It's a little funny.
- No, it's not.

28:49.099 --> 28:50.641
What do you want me to do, Sam, huh?

28:50.809 --> 28:54.059
Sit around all day, writing sad poems
about how I'm gonna die?

28:54.229 --> 28:56.103
You know what? I've got one.

28:56.273 --> 28:58.016
See, what rhymes with
"Shut up, Sam"?

28:58.191 --> 29:02.569
Dude, drop the attitude, Dean.
Quit turning everything into a punch line.

29:02.738 --> 29:05.941
You know something else?
Stop trying to act like you're not afraid.

29:06.116 --> 29:07.575
- I'm not.
- You're lying.

29:07.743 --> 29:10.150
Drop it because
I can see right through you.

29:10.329 --> 29:12.902
You got no idea
what you're talking about.

29:13.749 --> 29:15.373
Yeah, I do.

29:15.542 --> 29:18.792
You're scared, Dean. You're scared
because your year's running out...

29:18.962 --> 29:20.871
...and you're going to hell
and you're freaked.

29:21.048 --> 29:22.839
- And how do you know?
- Because I know you.

29:23.008 --> 29:26.092
- Really?
- I've been following you my entire life.

29:28.013 --> 29:30.930
I mean, I've been looking up
to you since I was 4, Dean.

29:31.099 --> 29:33.970
Studying you,
trying to be just like my big brother.

29:34.144 --> 29:35.887
So yeah, I know you.

29:36.063 --> 29:38.435
Better than anyone else
in the entire world.

29:39.691 --> 29:40.854
And this...

29:41.026 --> 29:44.146
...is exactly how you act
when you're terrified.

29:48.367 --> 29:50.193
And, I mean, I can't blame you.

29:50.369 --> 29:52.029
It's just...

29:56.500 --> 29:57.958
What?

29:59.878 --> 30:03.543
It's just I wish you would drop the show
and be my brother again.

30:04.049 --> 30:05.591
Because...

30:08.179 --> 30:10.053
Just because.

30:17.605 --> 30:20.013
All right, we'll hole up.

30:20.274 --> 30:22.101
Cover our scent so he can't track us.

30:22.276 --> 30:24.234
Wait the night out here.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.597
You've had that phone two hours, Dean.

30:58.771 --> 31:01.642
- Who'd you give the number to?
- Nobody.

31:05.778 --> 31:07.403
<i>- Hello?
Dean.</i>

31:10.408 --> 31:13.777
- How'd you get this number?
- Scent's all over the cell phone store.

31:13.953 --> 31:15.578
Of course, I can't smell you now.

31:16.497 --> 31:19.119
<i>- Where are you?
- You'll have to find us, won't you?</i>

31:19.292 --> 31:21.997
<i>- I'd rather you come to me.
- What's the matter, Gord-o?</i>

31:22.170 --> 31:25.586
You're not afraid of us, are you?
We're just sitting here. Bring it on.

31:25.757 --> 31:28.212
I don't think so.

31:29.677 --> 31:32.251
Please, please.

31:32.430 --> 31:34.138
Shh.

31:37.393 --> 31:39.600
Factory on Riverside off the turnpike.

31:39.771 --> 31:41.728
<i>Be here in 20 minutes...</i>

31:41.898 --> 31:43.890
<i>...or the girl dies.
- Gordon, let the girl go.</i>

31:44.067 --> 31:46.818
- Bye, Dean.
- Gordon, don't do this.

31:48.112 --> 31:50.485
You don't kill innocent people,
you're still a hunter.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.567
No.

31:54.119 --> 31:56.076
I'm a monster.

32:18.685 --> 32:20.927
Hey, hey, we got you.

32:21.104 --> 32:23.595
Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

32:24.691 --> 32:26.019
Right there. We got you.

32:26.192 --> 32:28.101
We got you. Come on. Get her up.

32:28.278 --> 32:30.235
Watch your head. Watch your head.

32:31.573 --> 32:33.482
Okay, okay.

32:33.825 --> 32:35.023
Sam, stay close.

32:41.082 --> 32:42.707
- Sam!
- Dean!

32:44.210 --> 32:46.286
Damn it, Sam!

32:49.966 --> 32:52.291
Sam, be careful.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.229
Gordon.

33:11.905 --> 33:13.981
You got me where you want me.

33:14.157 --> 33:16.233
Might as well come out and fight.

33:16.409 --> 33:19.114
I'm right here, Sam.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.833
What's the matter, Sammy?

33:25.001 --> 33:27.290
So this is really the way
you wanna do it, huh?

33:27.462 --> 33:29.205
Damn right I do.

33:39.725 --> 33:42.643
You have no idea what I faced...

33:43.479 --> 33:45.306
...to get here.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.976
I lost everything.

33:49.151 --> 33:50.480
My life.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.234
But it's worth it.

33:54.406 --> 33:56.446
Because I'm finally gonna kill...

33:56.617 --> 33:59.404
...the most dangerous thing
I ever hunted.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.994
You're not human, Sam.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.791
Look who's talking.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.453
Damn it!

34:07.086 --> 34:08.746
You're right.

34:10.005 --> 34:11.380
I'm a bloodthirsty killer.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.873
- Don't talk like you don't have a choice.
- I don't.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.676
Yes, you do, Gordon.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.469
You didn't kill that girl.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.465
No, I didn't.

34:21.016 --> 34:24.136
I did something much, much worse.

34:48.502 --> 34:50.909
I gotta hand it to you, Sam.

34:51.088 --> 34:53.579
You got a lot of people fooled.

34:53.841 --> 34:57.257
But see, I know the truth.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.883
I know what it's like.

35:00.681 --> 35:03.516
We're the same now, you and me.

35:04.977 --> 35:10.184
I know how it is walking around
with something evil inside you.

35:10.441 --> 35:14.652
It's just too bad you won't
do the right thing and kill yourself.

35:14.945 --> 35:16.690
I'm gonna.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.110
Soon as I'm done with you.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.367
Two last good-deeds:

35:21.620 --> 35:24.739
Killing you and killing myself.

35:47.604 --> 35:49.312
No!

37:10.062 --> 37:14.973
You just charged a super-vamped-out
Gordon with no weapon.

37:15.318 --> 37:17.987
It's a little reckless, don't you think?

37:34.295 --> 37:35.705
Here you go. Ah.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.584
- Thanks.
- Figure out what's making that rattle?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.501
Not yet.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.928
- Give me a box wrench, would you?
- Yeah.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.972
- Here you go. Yeah.
- Thanks.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.434
Sam.

37:56.609 --> 37:59.645
- Wrong one?
- No, no, no. Come here for a second.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.733
Yeah.

38:07.036 --> 38:11.413
This rattle could be a couple of things.
I'm thinking it's an out of tune carb.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.916
Okay.

38:15.586 --> 38:18.373
Ahem. All right,
see this thing? It's a valve cover.

38:18.547 --> 38:23.209
Inside are all the parts that are on
the head. Give me that socket wrench.

38:24.637 --> 38:28.681
- All right, you with me so far?
- Yeah, uh, valve cover covers the heads.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.470
Very good.
Now, this is your intake manifold, okay?

38:31.644 --> 38:32.972
On top of it...

It's a... A carburetor?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.014
- Carburetor. Very good.
- Yeah.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.525

- What? You don't mean you want...?
- Yeah, I do.

38:48.703 --> 38:50.079

38:50.247 --> 38:52.073

Showing my little brother the ropes.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.620
Put your shoulder into it.
