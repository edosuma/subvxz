- Yes.

01:49.473 --> 01:51.273
The creative masterminds

She's going to tell you
all about the incredible world

02:27.311 --> 02:29.445
of Monster High.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.679
Monster High

02:30.715 --> 02:33.282
is not your ordinary
high school.

02:33.317 --> 02:35.251
<i>It's a school
of teenage monsters</i>

02:35.286 --> 02:38.687
<i>that celebrates individuality
and kindness.</i>

02:38.723 --> 02:40.856
The school's students
include the daughters

02:40.891 --> 02:42.758
of Dracula, the werewolf,

02:42.793 --> 02:44.393
the mummy, and more,

02:44.428 --> 02:46.528
but even though they're
teenage monsters,

02:46.564 --> 02:48.764
they still face the everyday
challenges of high school.

02:48.799 --> 02:50.799
But more in
a monstery kind of way.

02:50.835 --> 02:53.369
They experience the humor
of awkward moments

02:53.404 --> 02:55.871
like when your arm falls off
in mad science class...

02:55.906 --> 02:59.074
- [laughing]
- Which is totally embarrassing.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.043
The fun of school events like,

03:01.078 --> 03:03.646
"Will the new werewolf
ask me to the prom?"

03:03.681 --> 03:04.913
- Aww.
- It's a place

03:04.949 --> 03:07.816
that celebrates their unique
and distinct differences

03:07.852 --> 03:11.120
and allows them
to really be themselves.

03:11.155 --> 03:14.390
Now, Natasha and her team
have toyed with the idea

03:14.425 --> 03:16.992
of bringing realistic versions
of their characters

03:17.028 --> 03:18.327
to the big screen,

03:18.362 --> 03:19.995
but they'd like
to get a better sense

03:20.031 --> 03:21.563
of what they might look like.

03:21.599 --> 03:23.699
So, that's where
you guys come in.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.434
- Whoo.
- Yes.

03:25.469 --> 03:28.904
For this week's Spotlight
Challenge, you'll choose a doll

03:28.939 --> 03:31.940
from Mattel's
Monster High franchise

03:31.976 --> 03:35.110
and transform it
into a realistic character

03:35.146 --> 03:37.046
fit for a feature film.

03:37.081 --> 03:39.014
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.617
I am very familiar
with Monster High toys

03:41.652 --> 03:43.686
<i>and anything involving that,</i>

03:43.721 --> 03:45.587
so it's gonna be
a fun challenge.

03:45.623 --> 03:46.855
This is awesome.

03:46.891 --> 03:48.557
Now, Natasha, what advice

03:48.592 --> 03:49.892
do you have for these guys

03:49.927 --> 03:52.728
in order to help them bring
these characters to life?

03:52.763 --> 03:54.630
My advice
would be to really embrace

03:54.665 --> 03:57.566
what makes each character
so unique... their stories

03:57.601 --> 03:59.535
and their signature
attributes... and play with that.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.904
But feel free to really
push their styles.

04:01.939 --> 04:03.272
- Cool.
- Thank you very much.

04:03.307 --> 04:04.540
- Of course.
- All right, guys.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.942
So, as a reminder,
there is immunity on the line

04:06.977 --> 04:08.210

04:08.245 --> 04:10.713

04:12.750 --> 04:14.950
Now.

04:14.985 --> 04:17.786
I know this is
a very daunting task.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.856
So, Natasha and I have arranged
for a little tutoring.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.624
- Yay.
- Yay.

04:22.660 --> 04:25.227

lead designers

04:25.262 --> 04:28.364

you get to know your characters,

04:28.399 --> 04:31.967
and give you feedback
on your design ideas.

04:32.002 --> 04:33.135
Does that sound good?

04:33.170 --> 04:34.336
All: Yeah.

04:34.372 --> 04:35.704
- That's really cool.
- All right, guys.

04:35.740 --> 04:38.874
It's time to head inside
to the Monster High gallery

04:38.909 --> 04:41.510
to choose your character
you're gonna bring to life,

04:41.545 --> 04:43.379
and when you get there,
I want you to grab a doll

04:43.414 --> 04:45.948
- and start working on a concept.
- Have fun.

- Okay, give us all the tips.

07:21.372 --> 07:22.437
All right.

07:22.473 --> 07:24.339
So, if you notice
where the wrappings are,

07:24.375 --> 07:26.008
there's a little bit
of gold shimmer.

07:26.043 --> 07:27.142
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, cool.

07:27.177 --> 07:29.244
Do you think that Cleo
would have Egyptian,

07:29.280 --> 07:31.313
like, hieroglyphs or anything,
like, on the wraps?

07:31.348 --> 07:32.514
Like, we can incorporate that
as a detail?

07:32.550 --> 07:33.515
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

07:33.551 --> 07:34.583
It is a wrapping, but

07:34.618 --> 07:36.018
we wanted to add
that monstery detail,

07:36.053 --> 07:38.554
so we did embed it
into her skin a little bit.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.422
Just to say, we're both
really huge Monster High fans.

07:40.457 --> 07:41.890
- We're really, really big fans.
- Yay. Thank you for being fans.

07:41.926 --> 07:43.225

07:46.697 --> 07:48.664
This is a weird shape
to deal with.

07:48.699 --> 07:50.632
This underbite
while at the same time

07:50.668 --> 07:51.700
making it look pretty.

07:51.735 --> 07:53.035
We're gonna find it difficult

07:53.070 --> 07:57.072
to turn Abbey Bominable
into a live-action character

07:57.107 --> 07:59.308
because she has human features,

07:59.343 --> 08:01.743
and the Abominable Snowman
is simian.

08:01.779 --> 08:03.345
- I see you got Abbey.
- Yes, we did.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.047
- We do.
- She's very blunt

08:05.082 --> 08:06.882
and very direct
and very straight-out.

08:06.917 --> 08:09.017

35:52.380 --> 35:54.714
You hit all
the Draculaura things.

35:54.783 --> 35:57.517
She has that Victorian
Gothic Lolita aesthetic.

35:57.586 --> 36:00.553
- That's what we were going for.
- It's a balloon bouquet.

36:00.622 --> 36:02.322
You've got everything going on.

36:02.390 --> 36:03.323
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

36:03.391 --> 36:04.657
You really did a beautiful job

36:04.726 --> 36:06.793
of capturing
Draculaura's essence.

36:06.862 --> 36:08.628
I can see as soon
as she came out

36:08.697 --> 36:10.063
that it was a party

36:10.131 --> 36:12.465
and she was very festive
and really delivered

36:12.534 --> 36:16.336
on that bubblegum goth
aesthetic that Draculaura has.

36:16.404 --> 36:17.437
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

36:17.506 --> 36:19.105
- Yeah.

- She is, um...
- A skeleton.

36:36.725 --> 36:39.926
- She's a skeleton...
- Which was a very scary thing

36:39.995 --> 36:41.728
to do because
you have to subtract

36:41.796 --> 36:43.062
and we're adding, so...

36:43.131 --> 36:44.898
We wanted to put
more color in her face but...

36:44.966 --> 36:46.499
- We ran out of time.
- Yeah.

36:46.568 --> 36:49.035
You made a skeleton look
gorgeous.

36:49.104 --> 36:51.104
Both: Thank you.

36:51.172 --> 36:52.705
Skelita is my favorite
character.

36:52.774 --> 36:55.308
It's what got me to collect
Monster High dolls.

36:55.377 --> 36:56.543
I really do appreciate

36:56.611 --> 36:58.778
that it stayed very true
to the character.

36:58.847 --> 37:01.180
The prosthetics on the hands
that look like bone, I mean,

37:01.249 --> 37:03.449
I was wondering how you guys
were gonna pull this one off,

37:03.518 --> 37:04.918
and I think
that we were all really

37:04.986 --> 37:06.286
nicely surprised.

37:06.354 --> 37:07.854
- It was very well-done.
- Mm-hmm.

37:07.923 --> 37:09.455
Definitely a massive amount
of props.

37:09.524 --> 37:12.025
It's not distracting.
It doesn't look cheesy.

37:12.093 --> 37:15.361
It actually adds
to the character so well,

37:15.430 --> 37:19.065
and with the glitter to give it
that sugar skull feeling,

37:19.134 --> 37:20.533
it's just really impressive.

37:20.602 --> 37:21.734
Both: Thank you.

37:21.803 --> 37:24.571
You really took the time
to add the details

37:24.639 --> 37:26.372
that make her who she is,
and it's evident.

37:26.441 --> 37:28.641
- It's really beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

37:28.710 --> 37:29.909
All right, guys.
Please step back.

We really wanted
to take this character

37:48.496 --> 37:49.596
from the doll form

37:49.664 --> 37:52.131
to make her
what we could see the daughter

37:52.200 --> 37:53.600
of a sea monster to look like.

37:53.668 --> 37:55.802
- I love her face.
- [laughter]

37:55.870 --> 37:57.704
I love her face.

37:57.772 --> 37:59.906
Her hair is just so amazing.

37:59.975 --> 38:02.275
It was the first wig

- Yeah.
- It's so good.

It actually looks like one
of her dolls.

38:06.314 --> 38:07.847
She has a little flip thing.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.315
- Cool.
- I love the cheek bones

38:09.384 --> 38:11.484
and the metallic touches on her
face I think are really good.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.119
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:13.188 --> 38:15.855
Usually, Lagoona
is a very sporty character,

38:15.924 --> 38:18.524
so I love
that you made her glam.

38:18.593 --> 38:21.260
She's my favorite,
so kudos to you.

38:21.329 --> 38:22.528
- You did amazing.
- Thank you.

38:22.597 --> 38:24.564
This was one
of my favorite looks for sure

38:24.633 --> 38:27.467
because you pushed it
so much further,

38:27.535 --> 38:29.402
and I think you captured
the essence of Lagoona

38:29.471 --> 38:30.770
but took those liberties,

38:30.839 --> 38:31.871
and it really paid off.

38:42.384 --> 38:43.449
Please head back

38:43.518 --> 38:44.717
while the focus group
deliberates.

38:44.786 --> 38:47.587
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

38:47.656 --> 38:49.789
Yeah.

38:51.893 --> 38:54.060
All right, so, why don't we
talk about tonight's makeups?

38:54.129 --> 38:57.263
Let's start with
Emily and Tyler.

38:57.332 --> 38:59.165
<i>Creatively,
I would never have thought</i>

38:59.234 --> 39:00.933
<i>to focus on Draculaura's collar</i>

39:01.002 --> 39:04.070
and make it a bat
wing-inspired piece... organic.

39:04.139 --> 39:06.072
- Right.
- That was so inspiring.

39:06.141 --> 39:07.674
I do like
that they kept her essence.

39:07.742 --> 39:08.841
The sweetness did come through

39:08.910 --> 39:11.244
all of that Victorian stuff
she had on.

39:11.312 --> 39:13.646
<i>Overall, with the skin tone,
I think they had the best.</i>

39:13.715 --> 39:15.615
Nice, even, and beautiful
in the face.

39:15.684 --> 39:16.849
If you saw this as a character,

39:16.918 --> 39:18.851
would this draw you
in to see the movie?

39:18.920 --> 39:21.387
I know that we're going for
a specific theme for Draculaura,

39:21.456 --> 39:22.789
but when I envision
Monster High,

39:22.857 --> 39:25.458
I envision we're seeing
her at school on a casual day,

39:25.527 --> 39:28.428
and I just didn't feel
that quite there.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.564
All right.
Let's move on to Evan and Ben,

39:31.633 --> 39:33.032
<i>who had Skelita.</i>

39:33.101 --> 39:34.901
<i>It translated so well</i>

39:34.969 --> 39:37.103
<i>with bone detail on human flesh.</i>

39:37.172 --> 39:38.638
<i>It didn't distract at all.</i>

39:38.707 --> 39:40.273
<i>It actually added
to the character,</i>

39:40.341 --> 39:41.974
which was really impressive.

39:42.043 --> 39:43.076
Of the three
that are up there, I feel

39:43.144 --> 39:44.343
like she's the most
that was like,

39:44.412 --> 39:45.678
"Here's the doll.
Here she is."

39:45.747 --> 39:47.346
<i>It's exactly the same thing.</i>

39:47.415 --> 39:49.315
And you could tell they spent
time on the accessories, too.

39:49.384 --> 39:51.217
The purse and the little
necklace... the skullette

39:51.286 --> 39:53.853
that she had on which
is important for Monster High.

39:53.922 --> 39:55.154
She was the prettiest, I think.

39:55.223 --> 39:56.456
- I agree.
- I wanted to take her home

39:56.524 --> 40:00.093
and put her on my shelf,
at the risk of sounding creepy.

40:00.161 --> 40:01.360
Is this a character

40:01.429 --> 40:02.695
that would draw you
in to see the movie?

40:02.764 --> 40:04.030
- Yes.
- Sure.

40:04.099 --> 40:06.833
- Unanimous.
- Oh, yes.

40:06.901 --> 40:08.468
All right.
Well, we can move onto

40:08.536 --> 40:11.537
George and Cig and Lagoona Blue.

40:11.606 --> 40:12.739
<i>I loved her face.</i>

40:12.807 --> 40:13.973
<i>I thought
she looked really cool.</i>

40:14.042 --> 40:15.441
<i>I thought she looked
like a great mix</i>

40:15.510 --> 40:17.610
<i>of real sea monster</i>

40:17.679 --> 40:19.378
and real
pretty high school girl.

40:19.447 --> 40:20.813
Especially, like, the scales.

40:20.882 --> 40:23.082
<i>There's so much work.
There's so many colors.</i>

40:23.151 --> 40:24.150
<i>I was really impressed
by the hair,</i>

40:24.219 --> 40:25.485
<i>what they did,
how they styled it,</i>

40:25.553 --> 40:26.819

<i>and all the little things

40:28.423 --> 40:30.022
- So, I really liked it.
- And being super-fans,

40:30.091 --> 40:32.158
were you guys cool with it
being pushed a little more?

40:32.227 --> 40:33.926
I want to see

40:33.995 --> 40:35.995

40:36.064 --> 40:38.865
<i>It's fresh,

40:38.933 --> 40:39.999
