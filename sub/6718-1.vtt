WEBVTT

03:33.839 --> 03:35.757
<i>My name is Quintus Dias.</i>

03:35.924 --> 03:37.759
<i>I'm a soldier of Rome.</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:41.096
<i>And this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>

03:55.944 --> 03:57.905
<i>Two years on the frontier.</i>

03:58.780 --> 04:00.908
<i>This place is the arsehole of the world.</i>

04:01.950 --> 04:03.994
<i>Even the land wants us dead.</i>

04:07.998 --> 04:11.877
Centurion Dias, it's too damn cold
to be standing watch.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.631
It's not my watch.
I'm just wondering what's out there.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.801
The patrol returns at dawn.
You should get some sleep.

04:19.968 --> 04:24.264
<i>The longer we stay, the deeper the cold
and damp soaks into our bones.</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:28.519
<i>And the rain makes way only
for the stinging bite of the north wind.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:31.480
<i>While we lose brave men
to foot rot and frostbite,</i>

04:31.647 --> 04:33.148
<i>the Pict king Gorlacon</i>

04:33.315 --> 04:36.235
<i>sends his war parties
to raid along the frontier at will.</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:37.903
- Gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.030
A cold night on the front.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.784
<i>My father believed
that to truly defeat an enemy,</i>

04:43.867 --> 04:45.994
<i>you must know him better than yourself.</i>

04:46.161 --> 04:48.038
<i>I know this enemy well.</i>

04:48.163 --> 04:52.209
<i>They play only to their strengths,
and will not be drawn into open combat.</i>

04:52.334 --> 04:54.878
<i>Instead, they pick at the scab
until we bleed,</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:56.880
<i>hiding in the shadows like animals,</i>

04:57.047 --> 05:01.051
<i>striking hard and fast
then falling back into the night.</i>

05:02.553 --> 05:06.348
<i>Come the dawn, we count our losses
and sow the earth with our dead.</i>

05:09.476 --> 05:14.815
<i>This is a new kind of war,
a war without honour, without end.</i>

05:28.495 --> 05:30.998
Come on! Come on!

05:37.754 --> 05:39.715
Marcus, ride to Agricola!

05:42.301 --> 05:44.261
Gate. Move!

05:47.139 --> 05:49.141
Move, soldier!

06:08.744 --> 06:11.496
- Gratus.
- Save yourself.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.822
Virilus! Virilus!

06:59.086 --> 07:00.295
The winner.

07:00.462 --> 07:03.549
- That's the way!
- Yes!

07:05.217 --> 07:06.343
Again!

07:08.554 --> 07:10.180
Enough!

07:10.347 --> 07:13.100
You put up a good fight,
now you drink with me.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.185
Septus, more ale.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.150
Again, Virilus.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.570
You're a drunk. An ugly drunk.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.535
And not too bright.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.081
Isn't ten times enough
to know when you're beaten?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.166
Damn you! Again!

07:39.001 --> 07:41.211
Once more!

07:43.380 --> 07:47.342
Septus, your ruling.
And watch my flank.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.098
Come on!

07:53.265 --> 07:55.142
Come on!

07:55.309 --> 07:59.438
- Virilus! Virilus! Virilus!
- You beat him.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.231
Virilus. Virilus.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.790
Sore loser.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.086
Septus?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.088
What are you waiting for, an order?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.007
Get stuck in there!

08:36.475 --> 08:38.435
Damn, that'll sober a man up quick!

08:39.394 --> 08:42.231
When will people learn
not to fuck with the Ninth?

08:48.403 --> 08:52.074
Some say it's irregular for you to be
seen drinking with the men of the Legion.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.118
Septus, my old friend, they forget.
I am a man of the Legion.

08:59.706 --> 09:04.586
- Soldier, have you been fighting?
- Fighting is my job.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.421
I have a message for your general.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.800
Now, point me in his direction
before I have you flogged.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.218
Who are you?

09:11.343 --> 09:13.971
I'm the personal envoy
of Governor Agricola.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.933
I suggest you get down off that horse
and give me your message

09:18.100 --> 09:19.560
before I have you flogged!

09:19.685 --> 09:22.938
General, sir!
It would be my pleasure.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.951
All leave is cancelled.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.538
Agricola is mobilising the Ninth.
We're going to war, Septus.

09:39.705 --> 09:43.041
Alert the senior legates to break camp
and prepare the men.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.629
- Sorry, General, sir...
- Return to Agricola at once.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.215
- Tell him we rode out within the hour.
- Yes, General.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.279
Bastard!

10:17.034 --> 10:18.911
Aeron.

10:19.077 --> 10:23.165
<i>Gorlacon. He was a farmer
until his wife was killed.</i>

10:23.290 --> 10:26.418
<i>Then he put down the plough
and took up the sword.</i>

10:28.253 --> 10:31.798
<i>He changed the way the Picts fought.
It worked.</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:36.053
<i>He turned the tide,
so they made him king.</i>

10:49.233 --> 10:51.485
What does Agricola intend
for my people?

10:51.652 --> 10:54.905
- Damn you, Pict!
- When will he send his armies north?

10:55.072 --> 10:57.950
I am a soldier of Rome! I will not yield!

11:17.261 --> 11:19.179
Rome will make you bleed for this.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.265
You first, Centurion.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.501
I don't care how you do it
but wipe them out.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.420
And bring Gorlacon before me in chains.

11:51.587 --> 11:55.382
Governor, you're the politician,
I'm just a simple soldier.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.761
But I'm not so simple that I can't see
you're looking for a way back to Rome.

11:59.928 --> 12:04.516
My bones ache for Rome.
This place is the graveyard of ambition.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.476
And men.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.147
And I won't sacrifice mine
to be pawns in your game.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.024
I see.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.484
Let us be frank, General.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.613
The conquest of Britain is a lost cause.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.284
With one bold stroke,
we could change all that.

12:22.451 --> 12:25.621
With the Ninth Legion at your command,
we can crush this enemy.

12:25.787 --> 12:29.875
You and your men could retire
with wealth and honour.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.794
My men have honour enough.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.923
Enough to disobey a direct order?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.262
Well...

12:44.389 --> 12:47.184
To kill the snake,
you have to cut off its head.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.311
I need to find Gorlacon.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.815
For that, I have someone special in mind.

13:07.996 --> 13:13.335
General Virilus, meet Etain,
my Brigantes tracker.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.673
Can't speak a word, but she can hunt
anything over any terrain.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.758
I swear she's part wolf.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.846
I apologise for the theatrics,
but I wanted to prove a point.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.182
Slaves cost nothing.
Trust is priceless.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.393
I don't know whether to fight her or...

13:29.560 --> 13:31.395
She's mute, not deaf!

13:33.188 --> 13:35.691
- I have my own scouts.
- Not like her!

13:35.858 --> 13:39.444
She knows the Picts. Knows their ways,
knows their hideaways.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.613
She will guide you into the mountains.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.550
What's she sitting over there for?

15:24.716 --> 15:27.386
- She's been looking at you all night.
- I've spotted it.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.304
Can't take her eyes off you.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.224
Come on, you.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.434
She's speechless, you daft bastard.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.313
She's got no tongue in her head, you fool.
I wouldn't get too close.

15:40.524 --> 15:44.570
No tongue, that's perfect,
she'll have... more room for this.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.322
- You be careful.
- Oh!

15:50.033 --> 15:52.411
I think that's Pict for "fuck off".

15:52.578 --> 15:54.872
She must be a good scout
if she can find your cock.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.707
I think it's love.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.209
I'll have a go with the mutt this time.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.252
Report.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.963
Three Pict riders and another,
a prisoner, on foot.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.965
I think he might be Roman.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.094
Centurion Remus,
take the column!

17:38.767 --> 17:40.519
Stay down! Stay down!

17:40.686 --> 17:42.437
Stay down!

17:48.861 --> 17:50.737
We'll get nothing out of him.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.032
We can't take prisoners on the march.
You know what to do.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.993
Head or ship?

17:56.159 --> 17:58.161
Head.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.124
I win.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.251
Sorry, mate. Orders are orders.

18:05.419 --> 18:06.545
Hey?

18:21.059 --> 18:22.936
Thank the gods you found me.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.314
Not the gods you should thank. It's her.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.400
Etain, our Pict scout. She found you.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.486
What's your name, soldier?

18:32.613 --> 18:34.448
I'm Quintus Dias.

18:34.615 --> 18:38.202
Second in Command.
Inch-tuth-il frontier garrison.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.789
Well, sorry we couldn't get here sooner.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.043
- Are you the relief column?
- Not quite.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.754
I'm Titus Flavius Virilus,
Commander of the Ninth Legion.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.881
We've come here looking for a fight.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.800
Then you'll get one.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.561
- General.
- Centurion Dias.

19:04.686 --> 19:08.815
Ha! Now you look like a Roman.
How do you feel?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.568
Cuts and bruises, sir.
Nothing that won't heal in time.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.656
Well, sometimes there are scars
that cannot be seen.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.784
You escaped the clutches of Gorlacon,

19:20.827 --> 19:23.830
but I must ask you to return with us
into the lion's den.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.999
Best to get back into the fight, General.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.878
- Spoken like a soldier.
- Gladiator.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.548
My father was Scipio Dias.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.884
I saw him win the fight
that earned him his freedom.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.928
He was magnificent.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.807
He taught me how to fight,
when to choose my battles.

19:44.393 --> 19:45.853
Come meet the men.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.609
- Septus.
- Sir?

19:52.776 --> 19:56.613
Get this man a drink.
I think he deserves it.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.909
Come and join us. Be warm.
Have a well-earned drink.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.119
Thank you.

20:03.495 --> 20:06.290
Tomorrow you ride by my side.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.835
Perhaps you can teach me something
about Pict hospitality.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.216
- Thax. Bothos.
- Sir.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.094
- Septus, I'll be doing my rounds.
- Sir.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.222
- Evening, General.
- I can't understand a word of these Picts.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.683
If they ever catch me, I'm fucked!

20:24.850 --> 20:27.686
I've never seen a general
so beloved of his men.

20:27.853 --> 20:31.690
Well, in training he is our scholar,
at the feast he is our father,

20:31.857 --> 20:34.359
in the ranks he is our brother.

20:34.526 --> 20:38.405
And in battle he is the god we pray
to save our souls.

20:38.530 --> 20:42.284
- Where did you read that?
- It's written on the shithouse wall, sir.

20:42.451 --> 20:46.079
- Probably wrote it himself.
- He's a ruthless, reckless bastard.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.750
And I'd die for him without hesitation.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.727
It's a trap!

22:31.894 --> 22:36.023
Column! Form up! Form up!

22:36.190 --> 22:39.484
Quickly! Come on!

22:39.651 --> 22:41.945
Dismount! Get the horses to the rear!

22:42.112 --> 22:45.699
Tight! Quickly!

22:47.910 --> 22:50.412
Steady, boys. Shields!

22:55.959 --> 22:57.503
Watching!

23:08.764 --> 23:13.727
Whatever comes out
of that mist, lads, you will hold the line.

23:17.773 --> 23:19.608
Quintus, ride to the rear.

23:19.775 --> 23:21.944
Tell Centurion Remus
to pull the column back.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.447
- Make a hole.
- Keep watching!

23:26.740 --> 23:28.367
Get ready!

23:30.786 --> 23:31.912
Watching.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.345
Hold the line!

24:14.121 --> 24:15.831
Stand tall!

26:38.807 --> 26:40.767
- Quintus.
- Bothos.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.730
- You made it.
- Yeah. This man saved my life.

26:44.855 --> 26:46.481
Brick, here.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.818
- The General?
- No.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.820
We've got to move.

26:51.987 --> 26:53.614
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.699
Come on.

27:05.334 --> 27:07.211
Let's get moving.

27:10.631 --> 27:12.341
<i>In the chaos of battle,</i>

27:12.508 --> 27:16.553
<i>when the ground beneath your feet
is a slurry of blood, puke, piss,</i>

27:16.720 --> 27:19.973
<i>and the entrails of friends
and enemies alike,</i>

27:20.140 --> 27:23.227
<i>it's easy to turn to the gods for salvation.</i>

27:24.102 --> 27:28.357
<i>But it's soldiers who do the fighting
and soldiers who do the dying.</i>

27:28.524 --> 27:31.568
<i>And the gods never get their feet wet.</i>

27:59.179 --> 28:01.890
- Thax.
- Thank the gods some of us made it.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.767
Only you?

28:08.939 --> 28:10.816
Macros, second cohort.

28:10.983 --> 28:13.277
Leonidas, junior scout and peltast.

28:14.027 --> 28:17.197
- Are we all that's left?
- We were outsmarted.

28:17.364 --> 28:20.033
That's all. Time to go home.

28:20.158 --> 28:23.287
We need to find the General's body.
He deserves a nobler tomb than this.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.330
The General's still alive.

28:25.497 --> 28:27.749
- Are you sure?
- I saw them take him away in chains.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.543
- Which way?
- North.

28:29.710 --> 28:32.004
- Then we follow north.
- You would go after the Picts?

28:32.171 --> 28:35.382
They'll have patrols sweeping
these forests for survivors.

28:35.549 --> 28:39.136
- We might as well slit our throats.
- If the General's alive, it's our duty.

28:39.303 --> 28:40.304
Yaargh!

28:44.933 --> 28:47.895
- Where did you come from?
- From the kitchens.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.315
Good work, soldier.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.903
My name's Tarak.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.863
I'm not a soldier, I'm a cook.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.489
Not any more.

28:59.656 --> 29:02.075
Scavenge what you can,
food supplies, weapons.

29:02.242 --> 29:04.161
Ditch your armour. We travel light.

29:16.632 --> 29:18.800
Shit! That Macros can move.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.136
He used to be a marathon runner
before he joined up.

29:21.303 --> 29:24.473
- How do you know that?
- We make the food, we know everything.

29:27.309 --> 29:28.477
Aargh!

30:22.656 --> 30:24.616
Take cover.

30:42.759 --> 30:43.760
Aargh!

31:05.365 --> 31:06.742
Aargh!

31:44.571 --> 31:47.115
I knew we should never have trusted
that bitch.

31:49.993 --> 31:52.079
I know where they've taken the General.

31:52.246 --> 31:54.206
Move out.

32:15.227 --> 32:17.145
This way. The cave.

32:17.312 --> 32:18.981
Get up those mountains. Get up!

32:28.824 --> 32:31.034
Here, some food.

32:32.244 --> 32:33.745
No!

32:33.912 --> 32:36.415
Death Caps. They can kill you in minutes.

32:37.916 --> 32:41.461
To the untrained eye, they look similar
to these, which are delicious.

32:44.256 --> 32:45.382
Thanks.

32:54.850 --> 32:58.312
Tarak. It's Assyrian, right?

32:58.478 --> 33:00.272
Yes.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.774
But it's not my real name.
It was given to me.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.402
- What's your real name?
- I doubt you could pronounce it.

33:05.569 --> 33:08.363
It's from the mountains of
the Hindu Kush where I was born.

33:10.949 --> 33:12.576
Leonidas, right?

33:12.743 --> 33:15.495
- Greek father, sir.
- Move closer to the fire.

33:20.501 --> 33:23.462
- Where are you from, Bothos?
- I'm from the army.

33:23.629 --> 33:26.423
It's all I've ever known.

33:27.216 --> 33:31.970
They picked me up from the street,
trained me, told me I could better myself.

33:33.222 --> 33:37.226
So, tell me, Bothos.
Do you feel better or worse?

33:39.728 --> 33:41.688
Macros?

33:43.065 --> 33:45.484
I escaped with my life
by running from Numidia.

33:45.651 --> 33:49.738
Didn't stop until I reached Greece.
Then I ran for sport.

33:49.905 --> 33:52.157
Now I'm running for my life again.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.284
We're all a long way from home.

33:57.913 --> 34:01.792
- This was supposed to be my last tour.
- Still could be.

34:02.918 --> 34:08.131
Had my eye on a farm in Tuscany,
where the sun warms the skin.

34:09.341 --> 34:10.717
Brick...

34:11.844 --> 34:13.971
What kind of name is that, anyway?

34:14.137 --> 34:17.641
Short, sir... for Ubrickulius.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.731
Your mother must have been... wise.

34:24.898 --> 34:27.818
She was a fucking comedian.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.530
"Brick" it is, then.

34:33.615 --> 34:37.077
Get some sleep. I'll stand first watch.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.850
- General.
- Where are my men?

35:00.017 --> 35:01.727
With your gods.

35:04.146 --> 35:05.939
Traitor!

35:06.523 --> 35:11.028
She would answer your charge
but she cannot speak. Do you know why?

35:11.195 --> 35:15.073
She was a child
when she came to us seeking sanctuary.

35:15.240 --> 35:19.453
Her own village had been slaughtered
as punishment for resisting Roman rule.

35:19.620 --> 35:23.749
To set an example,
they burnt out her father's eyes.

35:23.916 --> 35:27.252
They raped her mother
until she was begging to die.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.546
Etain was forced to watch...

35:30.589 --> 35:32.508
...before she too was raped.

35:32.674 --> 35:36.428
And finally they cut out her tongue
that she may not speak ill

35:36.595 --> 35:38.972
of the bloody Roman Empire.

35:42.518 --> 35:45.687
She fled north
and came to us for shelter.

35:45.854 --> 35:48.565
We raised her
and made her one of our own.

35:48.690 --> 35:51.401
And when she came of age,
we sent her back to you,

35:51.527 --> 35:56.448
to feign allegiance
and deliver you into our hands.

36:16.677 --> 36:18.929
The army is still dispersed.

36:19.096 --> 36:21.056
When it's dark, we go in.

37:31.752 --> 37:33.086
Come.

38:08.789 --> 38:09.831
Urgh!

38:11.875 --> 38:13.001
Come on.

38:16.588 --> 38:19.967
Brick, Bothos, with me.
The rest of you, watch the perimeter.

38:23.554 --> 38:25.138
General.

38:25.305 --> 38:28.475
- The Legion?
- Only myself and a small cohort remain.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.442
Oh, fuck.

38:47.786 --> 38:48.954
Oh, shit.

38:54.001 --> 38:55.586
Come on.

38:55.752 --> 38:57.462
Leave me.

39:10.976 --> 39:12.644
Shut up.

39:16.315 --> 39:18.358
- We need an axe.
- Leave!

39:18.525 --> 39:19.943
We will not abandon you, sir.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.113
What's left of the Legion
is yours to command. Now go.

39:27.326 --> 39:29.286
We have to leave.

39:32.456 --> 39:34.082
Go now!

39:37.336 --> 39:39.338
Get them home.

39:54.895 --> 39:56.855
That's for the Ninth.

40:06.865 --> 40:08.283
Where's Thax?

40:10.702 --> 40:12.579
Had to take care of a small problem.

40:12.746 --> 40:15.040
I've got the General's helmet.
Where is he?

40:15.207 --> 40:17.167
We couldn't free him. Come on.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.172
We came all this way for nothing!

40:26.051 --> 40:27.511
Fuck.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.949
See what you have done?

41:31.116 --> 41:35.704
Before you die, know that the men
who did this will not live to tell your tale.

41:38.665 --> 41:41.001
Well, let's get on with it, then.

41:44.922 --> 41:49.718
Your Roman friends should have known
cold iron does not bend. It breaks.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.742
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you fear me?

42:13.909 --> 42:15.953
No man brave enough?

42:27.005 --> 42:30.259
Let's see what you're made of...
she-wolf.

44:18.867 --> 44:20.369
Go!

44:55.863 --> 44:58.824
Come on. We need to keep
moving while we have the lead.

44:58.991 --> 45:02.202
- On foot, over this?
- Where they may hesitate, we must go.

45:03.912 --> 45:06.081
We keep moving. North.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.125
But our lines are to the south.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.794
And that's where
they'll be looking for us.

45:11.712 --> 45:14.256
Look... we can't outrun them.

45:14.381 --> 45:17.009
So we have to outsmart them.

45:17.176 --> 45:22.306
We head north, throw them off our trail,
then double back, west, then south.

45:24.892 --> 45:27.144
It may take days, even weeks.

45:27.311 --> 45:32.274
But we're so far behind enemy lines,
it's our only chance of getting home.

45:38.030 --> 45:39.239
Come on!

45:48.498 --> 45:50.626
You'll be needing this, then, Centurion.

47:00.529 --> 47:03.699
<i>When the Picts
come after you, they never stop.</i>

47:03.866 --> 47:08.579
<i>They can run for hours, ride for days.
They barely eat and rarely sleep.</i>

47:14.626 --> 47:18.005
<i>Etain, like the wolf,
has learned to hunt from birth.</i>

47:18.172 --> 47:20.048
<i>It is part sense, part instinct.</i>

47:20.215 --> 47:23.135
<i>She can read the terrain,
search for signs of passing,</i>

47:23.302 --> 47:26.430
<i>run her quarry to ground
and close in for the kill.</i>

47:28.473 --> 47:30.434
<i>Now she hunts Romans.</i>

47:31.185 --> 47:33.145
<i>Now we are the prey.</i>

48:12.017 --> 48:13.936
Move! Keep moving!

48:19.775 --> 48:21.443
Stop!

48:25.239 --> 48:28.909
- Leo, we've got to keep moving!
- No. We need to rest.

48:29.076 --> 48:31.745
- I can't go on, I'm too cold.
- Come, take him.

48:31.912 --> 48:34.957
Brick, find shelter,
anywhere out of this wind.

48:35.123 --> 48:37.084
Enough. Help me.

48:40.712 --> 48:44.550
He's slowing us down. Just say the word
and I'll take care of it.

48:46.176 --> 48:50.681
We live united or die divided...
starting with you.

48:54.476 --> 48:56.186
You can stick this out if you want,

48:56.353 --> 48:59.565
but first chance I get,
I'm taking care of myself.

48:59.731 --> 49:02.401
It's your funeral.

49:42.316 --> 49:45.777
<i>When they paint their faces
in the blue woad,</i>

49:45.944 --> 49:48.530
<i>it is more than just a decoration.</i>

49:48.697 --> 49:50.699
<i>It is a sacred rite.</i>

49:51.825 --> 49:55.412
<i>To the Picts,
it means they'd sooner die than fail.</i>

49:56.455 --> 50:00.000
<i>It means for them...
there is no turning back.</i>

50:51.844 --> 50:54.179
<i>These men are the best I've ever seen.</i>

50:58.308 --> 51:00.352
<i>Am I worthy enough to lead them?</i>

51:13.949 --> 51:20.289
<i>My father taught me that in life,
duty and honour matter above all things.</i>

51:20.455 --> 51:24.126
<i>A man without his word
is no better than a beast.</i>

51:27.462 --> 51:31.675
<i>I made a promise to a general
to get his soldiers home.</i>

51:32.384 --> 51:33.886
<i>That is my task.</i>

51:34.678 --> 51:36.305
<i>That is my duty.</i>

52:36.114 --> 52:38.867
Not bad for a Greek. Come on.

52:53.757 --> 52:55.717
Drink while it's hot.

52:59.429 --> 53:01.265
- What is that?
- The stomach.

53:01.431 --> 53:03.517
The moss inside is half digested.

53:06.728 --> 53:08.689
Try it, it's good.

54:37.402 --> 54:39.947
Quintus. They'll have heard him
from miles away.

54:41.156 --> 54:42.658
What's wrong?

54:44.952 --> 54:47.788
Move! Move! Move!

54:48.789 --> 54:50.707
Move! Move!

54:54.545 --> 54:55.838
This way!

54:57.589 --> 54:59.049
Move. Come on, let's go.

54:59.216 --> 55:01.051
Come on, get up!

55:05.973 --> 55:08.559
Come on!

55:30.330 --> 55:32.249
They're coming!

55:36.962 --> 55:40.132
- They're closing.
- Come on! Get your arses up here.

55:42.259 --> 55:45.429
Come on. Give me your hand!

55:46.847 --> 55:48.223
No!

55:53.937 --> 55:55.856
Shit!

55:56.023 --> 55:59.610
- We have to jump.
- Are you out of your mind?

55:59.776 --> 56:02.446
- Do it!
- Fuck it.

56:08.785 --> 56:11.955
- I can't!
- Yes, you can!

56:15.667 --> 56:17.419
You can do it!

56:24.718 --> 56:26.929
No! Tarak!

57:14.852 --> 57:17.187
Are you OK? Come on up.

57:19.731 --> 57:21.692
- Grab him.
- I've got him.

57:25.654 --> 57:27.447
Where's Tarak?

57:27.614 --> 57:29.575
I lost him.

57:30.617 --> 57:32.578
Thax, Macros?

57:35.664 --> 57:37.249
Let's get out.

57:41.170 --> 57:42.754
Come on.

57:51.388 --> 57:53.891
Take off the tunics,
they'll weigh us down.

58:08.238 --> 58:10.073
Oh, shit.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.659
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

58:14.786 --> 58:16.830
Then you can run.

58:26.924 --> 58:29.051
They've followed us downstream.

58:30.219 --> 58:33.680
That's it. Keep going.

58:44.983 --> 58:46.944
Shit!

58:47.110 --> 58:50.155
- She's onto us.
- Damn witch. How can she do that?

58:50.322 --> 58:54.451
It's not magic, she's a tracker.
And she's downwind of us.

59:10.717 --> 59:13.095
- What's happening?
- They're making camp across the valley.

59:13.262 --> 59:15.222
They don't care
if we know where they are.

59:15.389 --> 59:17.432
But she won't expect it... us.

59:18.559 --> 59:20.519
Bothos, watch over Leo.

59:21.228 --> 59:23.939
- What are you going to do?
- Going to even the odds.

59:24.106 --> 59:26.066
Come on.

59:46.545 --> 59:48.005
Aargh!

59:48.172 --> 59:49.631
Quintus!

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:13.363
Kill him and be done with it.

1:00:23.415 --> 1:00:24.458
No!

1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:58.033
They took his fucking head.

1:01:04.957 --> 1:01:08.043
- Bothos!
- They had the same idea as you.

1:01:08.210 --> 1:01:11.255
They're not defending their lives
or their country any more.

1:01:13.507 --> 1:01:16.343
They've sworn a blood vengeance
against us.

1:01:21.014 --> 1:01:22.724
And they won't rest...

1:01:23.851 --> 1:01:27.229
...until we beg them... for death.

1:01:27.396 --> 1:01:29.731
Are you ready to get on your knees
and beg?

1:01:29.898 --> 1:01:33.944
- I'm finished. It's hopeless.
- Hopeless?

1:01:34.987 --> 1:01:38.615
Hopeless is what they sing songs about,
write poems about.

1:01:39.658 --> 1:01:43.245
Hopeless is the stuff of legend, Bothos.
And being a legend will get you laid.

1:01:45.998 --> 1:01:47.499
What do I have to do?

1:01:47.666 --> 1:01:50.127
Keep moving, while we still have
darkness on our side.

1:01:50.294 --> 1:01:54.173
The gods have forsaken us.
We make our own chances now.

1:02:58.612 --> 1:02:59.571
Aargh!

1:03:00.906 --> 1:03:02.491
Macros. Macros.

1:03:07.162 --> 1:03:09.122
I... I can't keep up.

1:03:10.457 --> 1:03:12.334
I can't keep up.

1:03:18.674 --> 1:03:22.594
Macros, at least this way,
one of us will make it.

1:03:22.761 --> 1:03:25.639
- Bastard!
- Don't cry out, Macros.

1:03:25.806 --> 1:03:27.933
They'll end it quicker
if you don't cry out.

1:03:29.101 --> 1:03:32.312
Don't leave me! Thax!

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:34.064
Thax!

1:03:44.867 --> 1:03:46.118
Come on!

1:03:53.083 --> 1:03:55.252
We should give this place a wide berth.

1:03:56.086 --> 1:03:59.298
We need food and a place to rest.

1:04:56.855 --> 1:04:58.732
Where the hell are we now?

1:05:01.818 --> 1:05:04.905
- I'll get some water. Stay alert.
- Yeah.

1:05:05.072 --> 1:05:06.782
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa!

1:05:18.210 --> 1:05:20.045
Brick, go back inside.

1:05:20.212 --> 1:05:22.130
Go back inside now.

1:05:22.297 --> 1:05:24.258
I'll leave you to it, then.

1:06:09.428 --> 1:06:11.054
You speak my language.

1:06:30.282 --> 1:06:31.909
Are you from the garrison?

1:06:32.075 --> 1:06:34.745
I thought you'd stopped
coming up this far north.

1:06:34.870 --> 1:06:36.747
Garrison? What garrison?

1:06:36.914 --> 1:06:39.499
- Two days south of here.
- They come here?

1:06:39.666 --> 1:06:41.710
How do you think I know your language?

1:06:42.836 --> 1:06:45.506
I do what I can to discourage them.

1:06:45.631 --> 1:06:48.300
They think I'm a necromancer...

1:06:49.259 --> 1:06:51.094
...and they leave me alone.

1:06:52.304 --> 1:06:54.515
It usually works on the others.

1:06:55.724 --> 1:06:58.060
Why not you?

1:06:58.227 --> 1:07:00.812
We're too tired to be afraid.

1:07:00.979 --> 1:07:03.690
We were 3,000 and now we are three.

1:07:03.857 --> 1:07:05.442
Here.

1:07:11.823 --> 1:07:14.409
Brick, put the fucking knife down.

1:07:14.576 --> 1:07:17.871
Bothos, there's a Roman garrison
two days from here.

1:07:18.038 --> 1:07:20.624
It must be the Western Frontier Post
at Mentieth.

1:07:20.791 --> 1:07:22.543
Two days?

1:07:24.962 --> 1:07:26.922
Let's take a look at your friend.

1:07:38.642 --> 1:07:40.102
Quintus, what's she doing?

1:07:40.269 --> 1:07:42.187
She's a Pict and a woman...

1:07:42.354 --> 1:07:45.023
Two good reasons not to trust her!

1:07:59.663 --> 1:08:01.498
Right, that'll stop the bleeding.

1:08:22.561 --> 1:08:24.479
Death caps?

1:08:35.532 --> 1:08:37.326
Smells good.

1:08:39.703 --> 1:08:42.915
Well, how's your leg?
Has our witch worked her magic?

1:08:43.081 --> 1:08:45.167
Quintus, the mushrooms.

1:08:45.334 --> 1:08:48.003
- What?
- She's trying to poison us.

1:08:49.546 --> 1:08:51.507
Why heal your leg, only to kill you?

1:08:52.674 --> 1:08:54.635
Death caps have white gills.

1:08:55.469 --> 1:08:57.429
It pays to know your mushrooms.

1:09:06.063 --> 1:09:07.523
Good.

1:09:11.193 --> 1:09:13.153
It's really good.

1:09:24.581 --> 1:09:26.959
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

1:09:42.516 --> 1:09:44.601
Your men are very nervous.

1:09:46.144 --> 1:09:48.105
They ought to be.

1:09:48.272 --> 1:09:50.566
A demon stalks us day and night.

1:09:50.732 --> 1:09:51.859
A demon?

1:09:53.402 --> 1:09:55.404
They call her Etain.

1:09:56.154 --> 1:09:57.447
You know her?

1:09:57.614 --> 1:10:02.160
If Etain is hunting you,
you might as well be dead already.

1:10:02.327 --> 1:10:04.580
That's comforting.

1:10:04.746 --> 1:10:06.957
Her soul is an empty vessel.

1:10:07.958 --> 1:10:10.544
Only Roman blood can fill it.

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:30.063
Where's Arianne?

1:10:30.230 --> 1:10:32.357
She went to fetch us some breakfast.

1:10:35.611 --> 1:10:37.571
Are you OK?

1:11:02.679 --> 1:11:04.640
Is that for bait?

1:11:09.686 --> 1:11:14.691
Where I come from it's considered rude
to interrupt a man midflow.

1:11:15.359 --> 1:11:18.320
Where I come from it's considered
only fair to warn a man

1:11:18.487 --> 1:11:20.322
when he's pissing on his breakfast.

1:11:24.701 --> 1:11:26.662
Good point.

1:11:34.753 --> 1:11:38.090
Must've been a storm
in the hills last night.

1:11:40.008 --> 1:11:41.927
Come on!

1:11:47.099 --> 1:11:48.934
- Trouble.
- Let's get out of here. Bothos.

1:11:49.101 --> 1:11:51.603
Too late for that.

1:11:55.065 --> 1:11:58.861
Hide in the grain store
and don't make a sound.

1:13:51.306 --> 1:13:54.142
We put you in too much danger.
We'll leave.

1:13:54.309 --> 1:13:57.938
Leave now and she'll have you gutted
and skinned before nightfall.

1:13:58.564 --> 1:14:01.483
Stay until morning,
and your friend will be fit to travel.

1:14:03.986 --> 1:14:05.863
These are your people.

1:14:07.865 --> 1:14:09.825
They are not my people.

1:14:10.659 --> 1:14:14.288
Not since Gorlacon accused me
of witchery and gave me this...

1:14:15.455 --> 1:14:17.708
...to mark me as an outcast,

1:14:17.875 --> 1:14:20.836
and banished me
to live out my days here, alone.

1:14:26.925 --> 1:14:30.888
<i>What cruel devices
does fate yet have in store for us?</i>

1:14:34.224 --> 1:14:37.311
<i>To find sanctuary
in the house of our enemy.</i>

1:14:39.104 --> 1:14:41.064
<i>Is she angel...</i>

1:14:42.274 --> 1:14:44.026
<i>...or devil?</i>

1:14:49.031 --> 1:14:51.742
- Clear.
- All right.

1:14:51.909 --> 1:14:53.869
Get some rest.

1:15:06.507 --> 1:15:09.009
I'm a cantankerous old soldier...

1:15:11.053 --> 1:15:14.389
...but not too stubborn
to admit when I'm wrong.

1:15:17.017 --> 1:15:19.019
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

1:15:23.941 --> 1:15:25.901
There it is.

1:15:49.341 --> 1:15:51.927
- It's getting cold.
- Thank you.

1:15:56.932 --> 1:16:00.519
You've given us the shelter of your home,
the warmth of your fire,

1:16:01.395 --> 1:16:03.272
and risked your life for us.

1:16:03.438 --> 1:16:04.982
Why?

1:16:07.359 --> 1:16:10.821
I owe allegiance to no man,
but to whom I choose.

1:16:29.756 --> 1:16:31.758
Here's some food for the journey.

1:16:34.136 --> 1:16:35.512
Thank you.

1:16:37.055 --> 1:16:39.016
Good luck, Roman.

1:16:42.728 --> 1:16:44.396
Good luck, witch.

1:18:02.307 --> 1:18:04.351
Bothos, get up. Come on.

1:18:04.518 --> 1:18:06.311
My leg!

1:18:06.478 --> 1:18:08.981
Look! Look! See, the fire's burning.

1:18:09.815 --> 1:18:12.818
Look, hot food and a dry bed.
Come on.

1:18:42.472 --> 1:18:44.433
Agricola has fallen back.

1:18:45.684 --> 1:18:50.230
Emperor Hadrian has given orders
to form a new defensive line to the south.

1:18:50.397 --> 1:18:52.566
Giving up the ground we fought for.

1:18:52.733 --> 1:18:56.111
- And where does that leave us?
- Fucked.

1:19:07.873 --> 1:19:09.875
How does she do that?

1:19:11.877 --> 1:19:14.963
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of running.

1:19:43.116 --> 1:19:46.203
- This is all I could find.
- Make them count.

1:19:47.454 --> 1:19:49.248
For Virilus.

1:19:49.414 --> 1:19:51.041
For the Ninth.

1:20:44.761 --> 1:20:47.556
Bothos, they're flanking us.
West wall!

1:22:28.365 --> 1:22:29.491
Brick!

1:22:35.539 --> 1:22:36.707
Come on!

1:24:44.084 --> 1:24:46.545
- How much further do you think?
- I don't know.

1:24:46.670 --> 1:24:48.338
A day's ride. Maybe two.

1:25:08.650 --> 1:25:10.527
That's close enough, Thax.

1:25:10.652 --> 1:25:12.154
Oh, shit!

1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:15.782
I thought you were Picts.

1:25:17.993 --> 1:25:20.746
We thought you were dead.

1:25:27.586 --> 1:25:29.505
Where's Macros?

1:25:32.257 --> 1:25:34.468
Wolves got him.

1:25:42.601 --> 1:25:45.646
Is this it? Are we all that's left?

1:25:54.071 --> 1:25:56.198
Hey, at least the three of us made it!

1:26:00.285 --> 1:26:02.704
- We're not home yet.
- What are you talking about?

1:26:02.829 --> 1:26:05.582
- We should be at the frontier by now.
- No.

1:26:05.749 --> 1:26:08.418
Agricola's been given
his marching orders.

1:26:08.544 --> 1:26:13.757
Ha! So, Rome's finally given up
on this shithole of a country, then?

1:26:15.634 --> 1:26:17.594
Can't say that I'm sorry.

1:26:18.762 --> 1:26:21.265
Then we fought for nothing.

1:26:38.657 --> 1:26:40.659
Hup! Hup!

1:26:46.582 --> 1:26:51.003
- What happened with the boy, Thax?
- I've no idea what you're talking about.

1:27:32.169 --> 1:27:34.922
This is Hadrian's big, fucking plan?
A wall?

1:27:35.088 --> 1:27:37.049
Hey, who cares? We made it.

1:27:37.216 --> 1:27:39.468
- Let's go!
- Bothos, wait!

1:27:41.470 --> 1:27:43.347
Slow down, Centurion.

1:27:44.389 --> 1:27:46.350
Thax, what are you doing?

1:27:47.392 --> 1:27:49.811
Just making sure
that we understand each other.

1:27:51.271 --> 1:27:54.274
I understand that many good men died
because of what you did,

1:27:54.399 --> 1:27:55.984
and you will answer for it.

1:27:56.151 --> 1:27:58.695
Why did I just know
you were going to feel that way?

1:28:24.137 --> 1:28:25.222
Hey!

1:28:35.232 --> 1:28:37.192
Bothos!

1:30:15.541 --> 1:30:18.669
This report
confirms our worst fears.

1:30:19.962 --> 1:30:24.132
You fought your war, soldier,
and earned the gratitude of Rome.

1:30:24.299 --> 1:30:28.095
This man will show you to my private
quarters, he will see you fed.

1:30:28.262 --> 1:30:30.347
You look half starved.

1:30:35.978 --> 1:30:38.522
We cannot return to Rome in disgrace.

1:30:38.689 --> 1:30:41.275
Better that the fate of the Legion
remain a mystery

1:30:41.441 --> 1:30:43.527
than the truth of their failure be known.

1:30:44.361 --> 1:30:48.365
If word gets out, every tribe
and every nation will rise against us.

1:30:48.490 --> 1:30:50.868
It's too great a risk.

1:30:51.034 --> 1:30:53.287
Are we agreed, then?

1:30:53.453 --> 1:30:56.623
The fate of the Ninth Legion
will be struck from the record.

1:30:56.790 --> 1:30:58.584
Aye.

1:30:59.293 --> 1:31:00.669
Aye.

1:31:20.731 --> 1:31:22.691
I hope the food is to your liking.

1:31:25.444 --> 1:31:27.404
I've brought you some wine.

1:31:31.491 --> 1:31:33.744
It is the least we can do
for a hero of Rome.

1:31:57.226 --> 1:32:00.312
Is this how Rome honours her heroes?

1:32:00.479 --> 1:32:03.232
You want to bury the truth
and me along with it?

1:32:03.398 --> 1:32:06.068
You are too much of a risk.

1:32:14.326 --> 1:32:15.994
Where will you go?

1:32:16.161 --> 1:32:18.038
Where I belong.

1:32:45.482 --> 1:32:47.401
No!

1:32:56.493 --> 1:32:59.162
It seems my life is
in your hands again, witch.

1:33:03.125 --> 1:33:05.669
<i>My name is Quintus Dias.</i>

1:33:05.836 --> 1:33:07.796
<i>I am a fugitive of Rome.</i>

1:33:08.547 --> 1:33:13.218
<i>And this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>
