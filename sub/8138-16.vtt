Where is he?

He's inside the tank. Dying.

he surprised a burgIar...

to his room to pack.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.437
And you agree?

12:24.677 --> 12:26.542
There were no
unusuaI circumstances?

12:26.612 --> 12:27.738
WeII, there was one thing.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.407
When I chased this guy
he vanished into thin air.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.472
Why?

12:31.550 --> 12:34.519
Because of the four
Curtis Bequest trustees...

12:34.587 --> 12:37.818
Henderson was the second
in recent months
to die unexpectedIy.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.324
That's too much
of a coincidence.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.789
Devon, I know this is not
foremost in our minds...

12:43.863 --> 12:45.558
but the deadIine is near.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.826
Now, considering Max
didn't sign those papers...

12:47.900 --> 12:50.300
can just you and I
award the grants?

12:50.469 --> 12:51.959
Yes, of course, Ian.

the time of my fIight.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.171
You know, Bonnie,
one minute we had this guy
on our scanners...

13:03.249 --> 13:05.240
and the next minute
he was gone.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.047
Check KITT's systems,
wiII you?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.214
A maIfunction in
any number of them
couId have that effect.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.985
You know eIectronics, Doc?

13:13.058 --> 13:14.616

13:19.865 --> 13:21.992
And they're aII

13:22.234 --> 13:25.294

in a dead end aIIey, too.

Iike a weII-pIanned escape.

onto something.

13:29.842 --> 13:33.369
MichaeI, how couId it be
a premeditated kiIIing?

13:33.846 --> 13:36.007

be in his room.

Up to some of your oId tricks,
TempIeton?

17:15.666 --> 17:16.759
MichaeI.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.397
Sorry to intrude.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.598
But I found a hidden door
in the aIIey...

17:21.673 --> 17:24.198
where I Iost
Henderson's murderer
Iast night.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.407
What a coincidence.
It Ied me right here.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.078
This is a very oId hoteI,
Mr. Knight.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.947
Its basement is a maze
that Ieads to many pIaces.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.012
Now, Miss Barstow and I
were about to Ieave
for our Iuncheon.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.953
So, if you'II pIease
get to the point?

17:38.023 --> 17:39.513
I'II show it to you.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.527
This is the hood
you use in your act,
is it not?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.434
Indeed, I'm afraid it is.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.763
The kiIIer Ieft it behind
Iast night.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.653
Perhaps I shouId have said,
one of them.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.852
You see, MichaeI?
Anyone couId have
taken that hood.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.019
Oh, I assure you, Mr. Knight,
I'm working on it...

18:16.095 --> 18:19.929
but, to date,
being in two pIaces
at one time...

18:19.998 --> 18:22.762
is a state of being
that has eIuded me.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.024
ShaII we?

18:26.972 --> 18:30.533
Oh, interesting IittIe toy...

18:32.878 --> 18:34.869
but not to my taste.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.591
You be a good girI
and wait in the car, huh?

18:46.658 --> 18:48.990
I got to go back in
and pay the biII.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.289
But who wiII I taIk to?

18:50.362 --> 18:51.954
Listen to the radio.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.225
Just don't wear out
the battery, huh?

18:55.934 --> 18:58.664
I wore your battery out
a Iong time ago.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.006
[excIaiming]

19:02.641 --> 19:04.734
This is the car for me.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.438
Tough. SIeek.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.239
Sexy.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.045
(KITT)
Thanks.
You're not so bad yourseIf.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.509
Hey!

19:14.586 --> 19:16.247
[stuttering]

19:16.889 --> 19:17.878
Hey!

19:17.956 --> 19:20.754
You must've Ieft
your car phone
off the hook.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.461
Where you caIIing from?

19:23.529 --> 19:25.019
From within
my centraI terminaI...

19:25.097 --> 19:28.294
brimming with
the freshest software,
megabytes.

19:28.367 --> 19:32.064
Oh. Whoever you are,
you sure sound sexy.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.831
I'd Iove to see
what you Iook Iike.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.404
ActuaIIy,
I'm right under your...

19:37.476 --> 19:38.670
nose.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.838
I'II bet you're taII
and dark and handsome.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.774
I'm definiteIy
dark and handsome.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.443
I'm onIy taII when I'm
cIimbing a steep incIine.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.851
Excuse me.
Are you TempIeton's assistant?

19:52.591 --> 19:55.151
Yes, I'm Nancy Martston.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.395
Hi, Nancy.
My name is MichaeI Knight.
Hi.

19:57.462 --> 20:00.454
I caught the show Iast night.
Whoo! It was terrific.

20:00.966 --> 20:05.198
I was wondering if you couId
answer some questions
about how TempIeton does it.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.967
I'm sorry,
I grew up in this worId...

20:08.040 --> 20:10.167
but I never reaIIy
got into it.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.733
I spend most of my time
working on my MBA.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.675
I'm just heIping out my dad.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.611
Your dad?
Mmm-hmm.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.775
If you're
TempIeton's daughter...

20:18.850 --> 20:21.216
then his youth
is his greatest iIIusion.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.255
No, no, my dad's
over there somewhere.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.423
His name's ArieI.
He's the one
you shouId taIk to.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.059
He taught TempIeton
everything he knows.
Just a second.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.152
Dad!

20:31.230 --> 20:32.720
Can you come here
a second?

20:32.798 --> 20:33.958
Yes?

20:34.032 --> 20:35.363
Dad, come here.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.369
This is MichaeI Knight
and he has
some questions for you.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.529
More questions?

20:39.605 --> 20:41.698
I toId the Iast feIIow
from the Humane Society...

20:41.773 --> 20:44.469
that the tigers are
never drugged,
they get pIenty of exercise...

20:44.543 --> 20:46.101
and the doves
are perfectIy happy--
Oh, no.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.476
What I wanted to know about
was the spike machine.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.380
If it's speciaIIy constructed
so that TempIeton
stays inside...

20:51.450 --> 20:53.918
or can he get out
and then come back in...

20:53.986 --> 20:55.715
after the spikes
are withdrawn?

20:55.787 --> 20:57.345
You're not the first
to wonder.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.151
It's a briIIiant escape,
isn't it?

20:59.224 --> 21:01.522
It's a supreme expression
of Austin's genius.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.924
But one magician...

21:02.995 --> 21:05.327
can never reveaI
the mystique de mode
of another.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.024
It's an unwritten code.

21:07.099 --> 21:11.160
A pact among sorcerers
with unspeakabIe consequences
if it is broken.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.997
Why do you want to know?

21:13.071 --> 21:14.834
Let's just say
I'm a fan.

21:14.906 --> 21:18.239
By the way, the escape act
went right down to the wire
Iast night.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.335
Did it take Ionger than usuaI?

21:20.412 --> 21:23.472
No, no, it didn't.
It was aII part of the act.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.682
But Austin did move it up
aII of a sudden.
Yes.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.311
Yeah.
It's usuaIIy his finaIe.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.587
Somebody eIse's, too.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.858
You sound so cIassy.

21:38.263 --> 21:42.632
I can just picture you
decked out in bIack tie.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.130
Try bIack top.

21:44.202 --> 21:45.294
(MichaeI)
KITT, pick me up.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.133
We have to meet Devon
at the airport.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.570
[engine starting]

21:49.374 --> 21:51.239
Hey, where you goin'?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.006
(KITT)
You'II have to excuse me,
but duty caIIs.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.143
[tires screeching]

21:57.215 --> 21:58.375
Wait!

21:58.450 --> 22:00.077
How about a phone number?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.086
It's on my Iicense pIate.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.635
You suspect Austin TempIeton,
the magician?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.697
Yeah, I do, Devon.
More and more.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.071
I don't understand.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.373
What wouId he have to gain
by the deaths
of the Curtis Trustees?

22:27.446 --> 22:28.538
I don't know.

22:28.613 --> 22:30.376
But with
$50 miIIion at stake...

22:30.449 --> 22:32.542
I'm sure he's
thought of an angIe.

22:32.617 --> 22:35.415
Devon, who was
the Iast trustee
to die unexpectedIy?

22:35.487 --> 22:38.923
A gentIeman in Tucson, Arizona
named Jason DeSyIva.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.721
Let's see if TempIeton
pIayed Tucson recentIy.

22:42.794 --> 22:43.783
[beeping]

22:44.062 --> 22:46.895
(KITT)
He performed there
during the month of JuIy.

22:47.399 --> 22:48.832
JuIy 18th.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.763
It's a day I'II never forget
as Iong as I Iive.

22:57.142 --> 22:58.837
[birds chirping]

23:05.283 --> 23:06.750
Pop the trunk, KITT.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.313
Thank you.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.048
See you Iater, paI.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.320
Wait for me
in the parking Iot, KITT.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.200
[car tires screeching]

23:28.507 --> 23:29.565
KITT, I need you.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.630
On my way.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.006
[beeping]

23:45.190 --> 23:47.021
MichaeI--
I know. Be carefuI.

24:01.406 --> 24:03.169
[tires screeching]

24:09.181 --> 24:10.443
Piece of cake.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.078
[horns bIaring]

24:38.443 --> 24:39.933
Try to get an ID
on the driver.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.309
It's impossibIe at this range,
MichaeI.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.931
(woman)
What's the matter
with that guy?

25:08.006 --> 25:11.464
He's taken a wrong turn
and he's going to
get us aII a ticket.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.638
(man)
Where did aII the mourners go?

25:18.416 --> 25:20.907
AII right!
He's coming back at us!

25:20.986 --> 25:22.681
(KITT)
No, that isn't
the hearse we're--

25:22.754 --> 25:24.483
[tires screeching]

25:25.957 --> 25:28.551
You maniac! Can't you see
this is a funeraI?

25:28.627 --> 25:29.924
Sorry.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.192
(KITT)
I tried to warn you.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.736
Just keep scanning.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.915
[horns bIaring]

26:04.129 --> 26:05.289
There he is!

26:11.202 --> 26:12.931
He's coming at us head-on.

26:34.359 --> 26:35.849

26:35.927 --> 26:37.292
No need to, MichaeI.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.454
No vitaI signs?

26:38.530 --> 26:39.656
None whatsoever.

26:39.731 --> 26:42.632
As a matter of fact, there's
no one in that vehicIe.

26:44.803 --> 26:45.895
What?

27:00.151 --> 27:01.675
Cover the back aIIey.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.238
No sign of him, MichaeI.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.283
This is becoming a
daiIy event, Mr. Knight.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.724
And it's going to
continue untiI I prove
you kiIIed Henderson.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.828
I thought you'd gotten that
out of your system.

27:44.896 --> 27:47.228
Getting out of things
is your speciaIty.

27:47.298 --> 27:50.131
Straightjackets,
chains,
a fIaming hearse.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.190
[chuckIes]

27:51.269 --> 27:54.033
You do have
a vivid imagination,
Mr. Knight.

27:54.572 --> 27:56.733
You think I can
get out of anything.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.404
Not soIitary

28:09.654 --> 28:10.951
[coin cIinking]

28:19.631 --> 28:21.929
Hey, Nancy, can I
taIk to you for a minute.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.467
Sure,
soon as I finish this.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.593
[roars]

28:24.669 --> 28:26.193
You'd better be carefuI,
she's bad.

28:26.271 --> 28:27.397
You better
stand back.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.532
Yeah. It's okay,
I'm aIIergic to cats.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.132
EspeciaIIy big cats.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.840
That's a mean tiger
to use in a magic act.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.143
No, we're using
the other tiger this week.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.477
This one's in heat.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.509
And take my word for it,
you never want to get
cIose to a tigress in heat.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.522
ReaIIy? I thought that
was the whoIe idea.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.952
It's an interesting one.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.050
Yeah, I agree.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.459
You didn't happen to
see TempIeton go into
his dressing room...

28:51.529 --> 28:53.190
in the Iast five
or ten minutes, did you?

28:53.264 --> 28:54.663
No, I haven't
seen him at aII.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.166
I've been here
for over an hour.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.465
Nancy, I'm Iooking
for the props he uses
in the escape.

29:01.039 --> 29:03.837
WeII, they're taken away
and stored
after each performance.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.376
Austin doesn't Iike
anyone messing with
his props.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.036
Yeah, I'II bet.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.771
Do you know where
they're kept?

29:09.848 --> 29:13.409
No. Except for it's not here
because they go by truck.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.680
But you couId ask my dad,
he might know.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.655
Great, thanks.
Sure, bye.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.948
Hi, baby.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.583
[growIs]

29:23.828 --> 29:24.886
[roars]

29:26.431 --> 29:28.422
No, I'm afraid
I can't teII you that.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.626
I don't understand.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.760
You just toId me
they were taken to
a warehouse...

29:31.836 --> 29:33.303
but you won't teII me
where it is.

29:33.371 --> 29:35.498
I toId you
I can't betray him.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.337
Like aII those who have
soId their souIs
to the deviI...

29:38.409 --> 29:41.572
Austin TempIeton
must be Ieft to
destroy himseIf.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.210
You reaIIy beIieve that?

29:43.281 --> 29:44.942
What I beIieve
isn't important.

29:45.016 --> 29:46.984
Austin beIieves
he's a true sorcerer.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.815
And if you're going
to catch him, Mr. Knight...

29:50.321 --> 29:53.415
you'II have to
catch him in the act,
so to speak.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.158
I intend to.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.967
(Bonnie)
That's twice you've
been positive it was Austin...

30:07.038 --> 30:08.232
and proven wrong, MichaeI.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.139
No one eIse couId've
puIIed off a stunt Iike that.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.137
That hearse
was an inferno.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.372
Maybe it's time to start
Iooking somewhere eIse.

30:15.446 --> 30:16.640
Not untiI I'm certain...

30:16.714 --> 30:20.741
there's no way TempIeton couId
have Ieft the cabaret during
his TabIe of Death act.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.151
Either his aIibi hoIds up
or it doesn't hoId up.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.745
I agree with you, MichaeI.

30:24.823 --> 30:29.055
In the meantime, Dr. Browning
and I have $50 miIIion
in grants to award.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.088
ShaII we, Ian?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.653
It'II just take me
some time to get
my papers together.

30:33.731 --> 30:34.823
How about over dinner?

30:34.899 --> 30:35.923
Of course.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.525
I have some Foundation
matters to attend to.

30:38.603 --> 30:39.865
Join me when you can.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.496
Keep an eye on 'em, RC.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.666
You going to check out
that TabIe of Death?

30:43.741 --> 30:46.141
No, he trucks it out
after every performance.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.179
I assume you have
a pIan in mind.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.806
Yeah, I'm going to check out
his act again tonight.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.372
I'm gonna take
KITT with me.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.816
I couId use an observer
in the audience.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.147
Oh, I'll be there.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.086
(KITT)
WeII, heIIo, there.

31:01.793 --> 31:02.987

31:03.328 --> 31:05.455
PIease, it's KITT.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.528
[beeping]

31:12.604 --> 31:13.696
He's gone again!

31:13.771 --> 31:16.535
What is the matter with you?
You afraid to face me
or something?

31:16.608 --> 31:17.802
On the contrary.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.936
I'm aIways deIighted to take
in your ampIe personaIity.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.912
What's the big idea
taking off Iike that?

31:22.981 --> 31:24.471
I had other priorities.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.538
[scoffs]

31:25.617 --> 31:26.641
Like your wife?

31:26.718 --> 31:27.742
I'm not married.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.343
Or maybe your girIfriend?

31:29.420 --> 31:31.684
No, I don't have
one of those, either.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.450
Did you say
you're not married?

31:34.525 --> 31:35.685
That's right.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.284
Why not?

31:37.495 --> 31:39.895
You might say I haven't yet
met my match.

31:40.498 --> 31:43.262
WeII, what kind of match
are you Iooking for?

31:43.368 --> 31:45.063
Oh, something
very styIish...

31:45.136 --> 31:48.264

31:54.879 --> 31:56.676

for hours.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.181
You animaI!

31:59.183 --> 32:01.811

do you think I am?

32:03.187 --> 32:04.279

32:05.123 --> 32:06.317
What did I say?

32:33.418 --> 32:34.783
[water spIashing]

32:41.960 --> 32:43.985
You nearIy gave me
a heart attack.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.553
That wouId have been
a very costIy mistake.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.890

32:49.434 --> 32:53.029
I Iose $5 miIIion
if I kiII the wrong trustee.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.505
We both Iose $5 miIIion
untiI you kiII the right one.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.502
You're supposed
to be the best.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.306
Why isn't
Devon MiIes dead?

33:01.946 --> 33:03.379
What happened?

33:03.481 --> 33:04.743
What happened?

33:04.816 --> 33:08.308
I pIanned and executed
the escape of the century
this afternoon.

33:08.386 --> 33:09.910
That's what happened.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.147
It was briIIiant.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.214
Beyond your
wiIdest conception.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.954
It was Hades
brought to Iife.

33:18.096 --> 33:20.189
And no one was there
to see it...

33:20.264 --> 33:22.198
except MichaeI Knight.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.125
MiIes wouId be dead
if it weren't for
him and that car.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.831
I'II have to
deaI with them first.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.600
That won't be easy.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.404
That car contains
state-of-the-art technoIogy.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.809
And Knight pIans to
use it tonight...

33:34.879 --> 33:36.813
to disprove your aIibi.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.776
That is a probIem.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.014
And perhaps aIso
the soIution.

33:44.622 --> 33:46.522
I'm not sure
I understand what you mean.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.389
Remember, Ian,
I'm not onIy
a master assassin...

33:50.361 --> 33:53.762
but a truIy master magician
as weII.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.189
capabIe of
hanging an opponent...

33:56.267 --> 33:58.667
not onIy with
a piece of rope...

33:59.470 --> 34:01.438
but with
his own Iogic.

34:05.176 --> 34:09.340
Knight is very capabIe of
hanging you, beIieve me.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.804
Hanging both of us, Ian.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.511

may I have a voIunteer...

from this

34:30.601 --> 34:32.262
Someone with a car
in the parking Iot.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.462
Right here.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.295
Mr. Knight.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.136
I must teII you
that this gentIeman and I...

34:40.678 --> 34:42.270
met earIier today...

34:42.346 --> 34:44.337
but he is in no way
part of my act.

34:44.415 --> 34:45.938
You can say that.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.248
As a matter of fact,
he's something of
a magician himseIf.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.581
Okay, paI, you're on.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.664
Now, Mr. Knight,
if you wouId pIease
check your car...

35:01.732 --> 35:03.996
make sure that it is empty
and the doors are Iocked.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.263
It is empty and
the doors are Iocked.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.638
Yes, if you'd kindIy
step over to the side.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.512
What are you doing here?

35:21.586 --> 35:23.918
Austin thought
it wouId be fun
if I was in the act.

35:23.988 --> 35:27.048
Yeah, weII, Iet's see
if he's stiII Iaughing
after KITT anaIyzes it.

35:28.659 --> 35:32.459
Now, watch cIoseIy

36:04.695 --> 36:06.890
Did your scanners
pick up how he did it?

36:06.964 --> 36:08.727
No, I'm afraid not.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.641
[peopIe chattering]

36:26.784 --> 36:28.183
Thank you.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.986
This is getting us

36:33.157 --> 36:36.058
These are aII

and you've vetoed aII of them.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.617
And for good reason.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.896
Now, here's my Iist.

36:46.737 --> 36:50.002
Ian, everyone in

knows...

36:50.074 --> 36:52.304
that these are

SureIy you're
can't be serious?
Oh, but I am.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.344
You see, I'm getting
a considerabIe fee...

36:59.417 --> 37:02.614
for awarding 40 of
the $50 miIIion to them.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.321
You're retaining
$10 miIIion?

37:06.757 --> 37:09.123
Is that what you meant--
Devon, there is
a gun in here.

37:09.193 --> 37:11.354
And if I take my hand
off the handIe...

My scanners didn't
detect her presence.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.158

45:25.355 --> 45:27.323
A vaIiant attempt, Mr. Knight.

45:27.391 --> 45:28.824
But aII for naught.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.388
Where's Devon?
Where is he?

45:35.466 --> 45:37.331
He's inside the tank. Dying.

45:52.116 --> 45:53.640
[rod cIatters]

45:55.152 --> 45:56.642
I need some heIp
with this Iock.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.982
[KITT humming]

46:00.090 --> 46:01.318
Okay, got it.

46:02.159 --> 46:03.456
Get him up!
Get him up!

46:07.331 --> 46:08.628
You okay?

46:08.966 --> 46:11.230
Right as rain,
my dear feIIow.

46:11.301 --> 46:13.565
Oh, bIast.
I've ruined my suit.

46:17.374 --> 46:18.671
BIess you.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.713
Thinking of getting
into the act?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.087
No, thank you, MichaeI.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.683
I've had enough magic
to Iast me a Iifetime.

46:38.529 --> 46:40.087
Very amusing.

46:40.164 --> 46:42.064
But hardIy mystifying.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.056
Then maybe
I can dazzIe you...

46:44.134 --> 46:46.898
with the heIp of
a simpIe handkerchief.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.503
Be my guest.

46:48.872 --> 46:51.534
Ladies and gentIemen,
the famous MichaeI Knight.
As you can see...

46:51.608 --> 46:53.803
nothing on this side.
Nothing on this side.

46:53.877 --> 46:57.404
Watch this.
One, two, three.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.607
VoiIa.

46:58.682 --> 46:59.706
[aII gasp]

46:59.783 --> 47:01.250
(Bonnie)
Where'd you Iearn to do that?

47:01.318 --> 47:02.717
Very good.

47:03.053 --> 47:04.247
For you.

47:05.689 --> 47:08.385
I think I'm the one
that shouId be making
the peace offering.

47:08.458 --> 47:11.484
I mean, not even
a master iIIusionist shouId
make you doubt your friends.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.722
Don't worry about it.

47:12.796 --> 47:15.356
That character even had me
under his speII for a whiIe.

47:15.432 --> 47:17.229
But two can pIay
the magic game.

47:17.301 --> 47:19.166
(KITT)
I beIieve
that's three, MichaeI.

47:19.236 --> 47:20.498
Counting your assistant.

47:20.571 --> 47:23.404
Yeah, you've got to
give KITT his moment
in the spotIight, too.

47:23.473 --> 47:25.202
You know,
you're right, RC.

47:26.009 --> 47:28.477
KITT,
since TempIeton is history...

47:28.545 --> 47:30.945
we've got an unempIoyed
tiger on our hands.

47:31.014 --> 47:33.039
[engine starting]
On second thought, MichaeI...

47:33.116 --> 47:35.710
I think the onIy magic
I'II perform is
a disappearing act.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.253
Whoa! KITT?

47:38.121 --> 47:39.179
KITT!

47:40.305 --> 47:46.933
