01:12.552 --> 01:16.372
From Paris With Love

02:10.214 --> 02:12.666
Thank you, Cindy.
- Welcome.

02:13.678 --> 02:16.883
African Aids Summit's prep meeting with the 
Foreign Minister's tomorrow at noon.

02:17.002 --> 02:19.872
Summer conference on Wednesday, G8 and the 
secretarial conference dinner with the minister on Thursday.

02:19.968 --> 02:22.615
And a reception for the secretary of state on Friday, sir.

02:22.648 --> 02:26.179
Can't you see we have
more urgent matters to consider Reece?

02:27.174 --> 02:29.580
Of course, sir.

02:30.256 --> 02:32.307
Check.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.458
Must you always be so methodical.

02:34.619 --> 02:37.364
Well that's what you're paying me for sir.
- It's because you're worth every penny.

02:38.735 --> 02:45.650
But that doesn't mean I'm just gonna sit here
and watch you copy Fischer's ambush on Spassky back in '72.

02:47.874 --> 02:50.727
Ya!
- Parking lot number 17, Rue de Gaulle...

02:50.761 --> 02:54.098
7 section, silver series 5 BMW.
Same as before.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.831
Yes.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.705
Checkmate, sir.

03:07.803 --> 03:08.731
What! Wait, wait, wait.

03:08.764 --> 03:12.101
Excuse Sir, they need me downstairs
to review the summit seating chart with security.

03:12.134 --> 03:15.182
Ya well as long as you make sure that I am seated next
to the Foreign Minister.

03:15.216 --> 03:17.138
Of course, sir.
- By the way...

03:17.171 --> 03:20.922
if you ever find out which of those two
secretaries he's banging?

03:20.923 --> 03:21.923
The brunette or the blonde?

03:22.113 --> 03:24.841
I'm afraid both, Sir.

03:26.946 --> 03:30.425
God, I love the French.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.294
Hello.

06:21.390 --> 06:24.707
Good work, Reece.
- Thank you, sir.

06:24.740 --> 06:27.789
You know if you gave me the chance,
I could do so much more.

06:29.939 --> 06:33.147
I was thinking... I mean...

06:33.148 --> 06:35.820
have you received my application
for A-4 training?

06:36.328 --> 06:39.535
You'll get your shot at Special Ops, Reece.
But right now...

06:39.536 --> 06:42.584
I need you to secure a chip
for the Foreign minister's conference room during...

06:42.680 --> 06:44.510
tomorrow's meeting with the
Ambassador.

06:44.573 --> 06:47.203
Would that be a problem?

06:47.237 --> 06:50.927
No problem at all sir,
except I  don't have the chip.

06:50.961 --> 06:54.136
Really? I was told you
had it all afternoon.

06:55.821 --> 06:57.216
No, I'm quite sure I don't.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.302
Hold on.

07:00.555 --> 07:04.085
Left jacket pocket.

07:30.271 --> 07:32.773
Hi.

07:34.606 --> 07:35.801
Did you saved the world today, James?

07:36.054 --> 07:38.677
If only you knew, Caroline.

07:46.316 --> 07:48.914
Then tell me, what did you do?

07:49.301 --> 07:52.316
You know I can't go into details.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.482
Not yet.

08:07.560 --> 08:11.345
Alright then, what do you think about this?

08:21.198 --> 08:24.086
I think wow.

08:26.109 --> 08:28.903
You like the fabric?
- I love it.

08:28.937 --> 08:31.698
Looks kinda familiar though.
- It should.

08:31.794 --> 08:34.804
They're our bedroom curtains.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.568
Alright.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.111
So what are we eating for dinner?
- Woah, woah, wait a second.

08:50.207 --> 08:55.406
Is'nt part of French tradition that a woman
cooks while the guy watches TV?

08:55.792 --> 08:58.268
Well things have changed since
the middle ages, you know.

08:58.364 --> 09:01.594
Now is exactly the opposite.
- Why don't we skip...

09:01.690 --> 09:06.187
dinner altogether and go straight
to dessert?

09:06.292 --> 09:10.551
Is this all you can think about?
- Every second of the day.

09:50.377 --> 09:52.205
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Reece.

09:52.239 --> 09:56.154
Here is your topic list for today.
I've highlighted a three point shots.
The rest are mostly layups.

09:56.188 --> 09:58.783
Well done, Reece.
Heading back to the office right away?

09:58.817 --> 10:02.636
Do you mind if I stay and wait for you Sir?
- No, why don't you join us for the meeting?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.675
Thank you, sir.
- Bonjour.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.695
Francois.

10:09.728 --> 10:12.694
As I mentioned at our previous meeting...

10:12.790 --> 10:17.080
The president is extremely pleased with the way
your cabinet and the State Department...

10:17.081 --> 10:22.039
have come up with a mutual agreement on our policy
concerning the African continent...

10:22.135 --> 10:24.931
Gum?
- However we believe that...

10:25.027 --> 10:29.960
it would make a big difference if France
and the U. S. would release a common statement...

10:29.961 --> 10:33.311
on the position of our two
countries concerning the terms and ...

10:33.407 --> 10:37.158
conditions of the reduction
of international debt.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.349
We are also very pleased Thomas.

10:39.445 --> 10:42.332
Cough drop?
- No, thanks.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.319
Excuse me. Minister.

11:09.415 --> 11:12.658
Is it true that you recently
acquired several Goya's?

11:12.691 --> 11:15.238
Oh really? I would love to see them.

11:15.334 --> 11:19.877
Actually they are a loan. 
They're absolutely remarkable.
You must see them.

11:20.028 --> 11:23.279
You know we have several Goya's
in New York at the Frick Museum.

11:23.811 --> 11:24.811
Have you?

12:38.050 --> 12:40.328
Caroline?

13:02.792 --> 13:05.294
James!

13:06.387 --> 13:09.499
I'm sorry, I've spilled all the sauce.

13:10.269 --> 13:12.804
The sauce.

13:13.639 --> 13:16.236
Have you made dinner?

13:16.270 --> 13:19.656
Don't worry I didn't cook.
It's takeout.

13:22.977 --> 13:25.737
I have a gift for you.

13:26.507 --> 13:29.492
I forgot, didn't I?
- No, no, you haven't forgot anything just...

13:30.164 --> 13:32.668
Just open it.

13:38.861 --> 13:42.010
Hello.
- Planting a mike in the minister's private office.

13:42.011 --> 13:43.855
- Very impressive, Reece.

13:44.529 --> 13:47.639
Thank you, sir.
Anything that I  do to help.

13:47.735 --> 13:52.054
- I appreciate that. That's why I'm
giving you the next job on such short notice.

13:52.119 --> 13:54.429
I'm ready. When?
- Tonight.

13:54.431 --> 13:56.533
- Be at the airport as soon as you can.

13:56.534 --> 13:58.007
You know I haven't been briefed?

13:58.008 --> 14:01.208
-Your partner is being held by the French customs.
I need you to get him out of there.

14:01.242 --> 14:03.995
My partner?
- Charlie Wax.

14:04.759 --> 14:06.762
Right now?
- Is there a problem?

14:06.763 --> 14:10.356
You're busy?
- No, no, no, not at all.

14:12.139 --> 14:15.076
Sir, you do realize that I am not
special ops certified?

14:15.172 --> 14:19.198
- I'm a man short Reece. Besides,
it's mostly driving Wax around.

14:19.232 --> 14:23.145
-Nail this job and consider
yourself a member of the club.

14:31.653 --> 14:35.682
It's the promotion.
- That's wonderful.

14:36.658 --> 14:41.468
So at least we have two things to celebrate tonight.
- Two things to celebrate?

14:41.469 --> 14:43.698
What else?

15:01.657 --> 15:04.607
It was my father's.

15:08.123 --> 15:12.425
If I waited for you to ask,
it would never happen.

15:21.794 --> 15:25.225
I love you.

15:32.546 --> 15:37.136
Promise me you'll never take it off.
- I promise.

15:37.388 --> 15:40.468
Sure you wanna marry a guy
with my line of work?

15:41.142 --> 15:44.961
Who else is gonna sew the
bullet holes in your coat if you get shot.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.694
I'll be here waiting.
- You better.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.893
Oh wait, one more kiss.
- Don't get me started. My partner's waiting.

15:57.927 --> 16:00.781
Just remember who your partner really is.

16:23.407 --> 16:26.132
That's the man you are looking for.

16:27.223 --> 16:30.417
You don't serve energy drinks in Paris?
It's for working out.

16:30.517 --> 16:34.124
To recover from jet lag.
- You sure this is Charlie Wax?

16:36.851 --> 16:39.582
Take him off our hands,
before we lock him up.

16:39.682 --> 16:43.974
Without the cans.
He can't bring in the cans.

16:44.007 --> 16:48.325
Look, it's corn syrup, caffeine and water.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.709
And a cool label, that's all it is.

16:53.217 --> 16:56.363
Try it.
- It will never enter France.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.892
Well that's all we got
here, Mother Fucker.

16:59.992 --> 17:03.374
Mother fucker?
- Don't get your panties up in a bunch...

17:03.408 --> 17:06.780
because I use the M word as a adjective?

17:06.781 --> 17:10.423
As when I landed at the airport
I was confronted by a self-important,

17:10.424 --> 17:16.065
American hating, frog leg eating, snail sucking
motherfucking cockin sucking bureaucrat.

17:16.098 --> 17:20.167
Coz I rather use it as a noun as in
This motherfucker hates Americans so much

17:20.263 --> 17:24.519
Even though we saved his country's ass in
not only one world war but two ...

17:24.520 --> 17:26.521
He still wouldn't let me bring in my cans.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.512
So now that we are clear about
how I use M word...

17:29.612 --> 17:33.452
With no disrespect to you
or your official capacity...

17:33.552 --> 17:36.493
as the guardian of your country's borders ...

17:36.589 --> 17:39.964
I would just move on with my cans.
- No, Monsiour

17:39.998 --> 17:42.599
It will never enter France! OK?

17:42.695 --> 17:45.061
Well, how am I suppose to
have the energy to enjoy...

17:45.157 --> 17:47.914
the endless pleasures of
your fine city?

17:48.010 --> 17:51.428
We can get you some shots of espresso
on the way out instead, sir.

17:56.149 --> 17:59.764
It is very important that you clear customs.
- Not without my cans!

18:00.881 --> 18:03.383
Pardon Monsiour.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.144
Can I talk to you for a minute?

18:08.968 --> 18:12.734
They've got a real problem with those cans.
- So it seems. I'm running late. Do you know this place?

18:12.902 --> 18:14.952
Yeah, they're better chinese food in town.

18:15.052 --> 18:19.310
Yeah, I hear they make a killer egg foo young.
So slip this guy some bills and let's get me over there.

18:19.406 --> 18:21.289
That's not how we do things here, sir.

18:21.322 --> 18:25.055
Well That's how I do things. Why don't you
call the embassy and get me a different driver...

18:25.056 --> 18:27.349
who will comply to how I do things.

18:27.437 --> 18:30.285
I'm not your driver. I'm your partner.

18:30.286 --> 18:32.972
Hey, the chess player.
I read your file.

18:33.519 --> 18:37.265
You play?
- Do I look like I play board games?

18:37.913 --> 18:42.961
So why don't you get this guy laid. 
Give him a box of Cohibas and a bottle of Chivas. Do whatever it takes...

18:42.962 --> 18:46.233
just get it done.
- Why don't I try a little more subtle.

18:56.076 --> 18:58.076
Ha, ha, ha!

18:58.871 --> 19:02.494
Checkmate, motherfucker!

19:07.376 --> 19:09.702
You know that really was not necessary back there?

19:09.703 --> 19:12.958
Yeah, I know. I just like sticking to the self righteous little pricks.

19:13.478 --> 19:18.485
Think just because they got a badge and a uniform
they can lord over us civilians anytime the mood strikes them.

19:18.486 --> 19:20.626
You know we can probably get
that drink down in any supermarket?

19:20.721 --> 19:24.261
Yeah, I know that too.
- So what's the big deal over some corn syrup, caffeine and water?

19:24.357 --> 19:26.927
Well the big deal is my secret ingredient.

19:27.023 --> 19:31.472
Which I cannot take the chance
that they would find out about.

19:31.828 --> 19:37.599
Hence the diversionalry tactics of the
grammatical variation of motherfucker.

19:37.633 --> 19:40.554
You mean everything back there was...
- You didn't get that?

19:43.123 --> 19:46.907
You know I am authorized to you any weapon you want.
- Yeah, but not like this one.

19:46.941 --> 19:49.539
Because me and Mrs Jones...

19:50.170 --> 19:55.967
We got a thang... going on...

19:56.200 --> 19:58.396
'til death do us part.

20:16.370 --> 20:18.936
No gravy.

20:18.969 --> 20:22.103
Leave it up to the French
to fuck up China's number one dish.

20:22.199 --> 20:24.423
It's not Chinese, it's American.
- Bullshit!

20:24.744 --> 20:26.758
It was invented by a
Jewish guy in San Francisco.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.389
Bullshit again.
- I'm telling you the truth.

20:28.485 --> 20:30.519
There's nothing Chinese about it.
Not even the name!

20:30.552 --> 20:33.054
"Foo Young" has got nothing to do
with what's in that dish.

20:33.088 --> 20:36.809
Oh! So you're not only a chessmaster,
you're a Chinese language specialist.

20:36.842 --> 20:39.859
Level 2 Mandarin at Cambridge Night school .
- Oh really?

20:39.893 --> 20:43.033
And the Chinese word for 'egg' is 'da'.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.240
Excuse me! Sir!

20:47.756 --> 20:50.320
Yes, sir.

20:51.380 --> 20:55.062
How do you say 'egg' in Chinese?
- I'm sorry, I'm fourth generation...

20:55.063 --> 20:57.804
I'm born in Bristow.
I don't speak Chinese.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.536
Hey take it easy the guy says he doesn't speak Chinese.
- Maybe this is something he does speak.

21:01.632 --> 21:05.845
What the fuck! Wax that guy's just a waiter.
- Well he's a waiter he can help us order dessert, can't he?

21:05.879 --> 21:10.399
I was looking for a Pakistani-Chinese dish.
- No dessert, just fortune cookies.

21:10.582 --> 21:12.419
Oh! Then just order off the menu then.

21:12.515 --> 21:13.998
Cream brulee pastry.

21:13.999 --> 21:16.710
No, no, no, I'm more in the mood for
something you can sniff off a spoon.

21:16.429 --> 21:18.475
Something you buy by the kilo.

21:59.283 --> 22:01.848
You good?

22:01.881 --> 22:05.400
Let's just get outta here.
- Did I say we were done?

22:05.434 --> 22:08.920
Look! if you really want to score some coke,
I'm sure I can find someone someplace else.

22:09.016 --> 22:10.547
We're not going anywhere.
Where's the blow?

22:10.581 --> 22:12.266
No blow.

22:12.267 --> 22:13.267
FUCK aargh!

22:13.212 --> 22:15.777
Where is the blow?

22:16.739 --> 22:19.243
No blow!

22:31.919 --> 22:35.607
Empty that vase and collect some of that shit.

22:41.610 --> 22:46.176
Did you ever noticed the closer you get to
the people who cook this shit the better it tastes!

22:46.177 --> 22:50.588
And from the taste we'll about two people removed
from the chef has got the recipe for this fine product.

22:51.635 --> 22:55.634
You tell whoever you work for. I didn't
kill you because I've got a message for him.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.944
Wax on, Wax off.

22:59.838 --> 23:02.277
Come on, pard.

23:04.779 --> 23:07.154
Give me the keys. 
Come on.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.760
Whoa! Hey! Wax!

23:37.736 --> 23:40.976
Wax on, Wax off.

23:41.010 --> 23:43.705
What about it?
- I don't get it.

23:43.739 --> 23:46.047
What are you the karate kid or something?

23:46.080 --> 23:49.995
If you want to be a secret agent man,
you have to roll like a secret agent man. That's code.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.417
Code?
- Yeah Code.

23:52.789 --> 23:55.933
Wax is on. He's gonna take you off.

23:56.640 --> 24:01.228
Gives them something to think about.
Throws them off balance.

24:03.378 --> 24:07.678
Got it?
- Got it. 
Good.

24:32.098 --> 24:35.129
What about this? Evidence?

24:35.310 --> 24:38.291
Evidence my ass. Where we're
headed that's better than cash.

24:38.387 --> 24:41.376
As long as it's all official business, right?

24:42.049 --> 24:45.418
Well, if you knew this college girl named Charlotte.

24:45.871 --> 24:46.871
Charlotte!
-Yeah.

24:47.121 --> 24:50.875
Scored some shit at that Chinese restaurant
and the next things you know she was overdosing.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.462
You got me riding in along on
some personal, off the book job?

24:54.558 --> 24:58.480
Fuck, yeah it's personal. Trying to take it down
to some kid who lost a party.

24:58.514 --> 25:02.008
Look! I'm sorry about your friend, Charlotte,
whoever she is...

25:02.042 --> 25:05.058
but if this isn't about national
security I'm not going along with this.

25:05.092 --> 25:08.106
It is when she is the Secretary of Defense's niece.

25:10.876 --> 25:13.460
The Secretary Of Defense wants us to
shut these guys down, right?

25:13.463 --> 25:17.599
The whole operation, top to bottom, chef to chief,
you got a problem with that?

25:19.533 --> 25:22.740
Hmm? Nope.
- Good.

25:52.488 --> 25:56.627
Hey! Yo, you can't park here.
- Well, I just did.

25:57.047 --> 26:00.607
C'mon. Muscle you up, pard.

26:05.099 --> 26:08.820
Hey! there's a secret code. Let me just...
- Let me. I'm really good at guessing.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.649
There is a 9mm and two clips.

26:10.650 --> 26:13.215
Well I prefer sending my partners 
in with a little heavier.

26:13.898 --> 26:16.598
So I would skip the Glocks and go with this .357.

26:16.654 --> 26:20.471
It's got a smoke trail better than a Cohiba.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.677
Oh, shit!

26:24.773 --> 26:26.566
Use your Cambridge level 2...

26:26.599 --> 26:28.358
Tell them you're interested
in what the're selling.

26:28.454 --> 26:32.571
These are Dragons head's, I think we should just
buy what they're selling and get the hell outta here.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.610
Oh man! I just gave you a straight up Hong Kong, Shaw Brothers...

26:35.706 --> 26:40.896
kung fu, motherfucking chop souy show
and you're worried about this candy ass street gang.

26:40.897 --> 26:45.412
That was against kitchen staff! 
-Kitchen staff? They're no kitchen staff sheddin' lead like that!

26:45.445 --> 26:47.842
They're not kitchen staff hoss.
- Well maybe not...

26:47.938 --> 26:51.858
but these guys are gonna make those
guys look like choir boys.

26:53.022 --> 26:57.298
Well they're no L.A. Maria Via gang.
Just some Asians dudes.

26:57.332 --> 27:02.061
Now we're cool with the asian dudes. 
Am I right brother?

27:03.507 --> 27:06.361
Wrong, brother!

27:30.397 --> 27:33.671
Now tell me that it wasn't some impressive shit.

27:33.704 --> 27:36.655
Kitchen staff!

28:14.074 --> 28:17.029
Stay one floor below me. I don't want
these guys crawling up my ass.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.527
Got it.

29:35.426 --> 29:38.033
How many more of them do you think there are?

29:38.129 --> 29:41.839
Last census? About a billion.

30:15.923 --> 30:19.419
Translate for me.
- Okay.

30:19.582 --> 30:24.182
I want an address book with every dealer, pimp
and prostitute in your network.

30:28.379 --> 30:33.713
When called, the next party you'll have will
be catered off a park bench in Beijing.

30:40.376 --> 30:44.098
You can keep this all.

30:44.548 --> 30:49.007
You just have to give me the address
of the man who delivers all of your cocaine.

30:52.378 --> 30:55.651
You have 20 seconds, or you won't have another chance.

31:48.544 --> 31:51.293
Get outta the way!

32:31.569 --> 32:35.129
two or three guys.
- Go, go, go!

33:00.258 --> 33:02.664
Cover me.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.277
- Just remember yesterday you
were unscrewing license plates.

34:33.377 --> 34:35.193
- Now we got you working with our top operative.

34:35.509 --> 34:37.272
- Isn't that what you wanted?
Yes, sir.

34:37.304 --> 34:40.402
And I appreciate the confidence,
but...

34:40.435 --> 34:43.466
Don't you think Wax's methods aren't exactly a...
- What?

34:43.498 --> 34:46.128
He's got me walking around with
a vase full of coke, sir.

34:46.161 --> 34:50.141
- I'll admit his playbook's a bit unorthodox,
but Wax always gets it done.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.484
I understand but don't you think...
- Stop thinking Reece.

34:52.516 --> 34:54.570
- Just do exactly what Wax says.

34:56.271 --> 34:58.900
So we're cool?

34:58.934 --> 35:01.243
This is all official business right?

35:01.276 --> 35:04.195
- From the King on down.
Thank you, sir.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.085
I just wanted to make sure...
- Reece do not call me again...

35:07.118 --> 35:09.877
- Not until this job is done.

35:20.884 --> 35:23.484
Caroline, I'm sorry,
I meant to call you.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.050
- You just disappeared. Where are you?

35:28.362 --> 35:30.288
Shit.

35:33.051 --> 35:34.975
Reece, let's go!

35:35.010 --> 35:38.379
We got some time to pep up
before we go to Mr. Wong's drug dealer.

35:39.135 --> 35:41.167
Hey, you think they serve breakfast up in the Eiffel Tower?

35:46.519 --> 35:47.954
- Will you leave your cellphone for a second?

35:49.586 --> 35:50.761
I just need to make this one call. Okay!

35:53.254 --> 35:54.579
Calling your girl ain't gonna get you home any quicker.

35:55.808 --> 35:59.001
You don't have anybody to go home to, do you?
- I thought you already met my wife?

36:00.709 --> 36:02.266
You met Caroline,
you might feel a little different.

36:03.402 --> 36:04.946
I woke up with my share of Caroline's.

36:06.037 --> 36:09.723
She is no ordinary girl Wax!.
- They never are.

36:11.263 --> 36:12.519
Come on. Come on...

36:21.479 --> 36:23.585
Lots of shit in here, go ahead.

36:23.586 --> 36:25.919
Hey! I thought this wasn't about you scoring coke?
It's not.

36:26.263 --> 36:29.487
It's about smoothing over the edges
so that we can make it home alive.

36:29.803 --> 36:31.847
Wouldn't you rather one of us actually have his wits about?

36:31.848 --> 36:35.539
I would rather not get shot because someone
spotted you as an embassy gofer.

36:35.887 --> 36:39.102
Well that's your problem,
because I'm not sticking that shit up my nose.

36:40.491 --> 36:44.928
You enjoy your walk home okay. Maybe you can
flip my license plates next time I come to town.

36:53.887 --> 36:58.956
Good. Alright, now maybe you would be in that car with me.
Turn around, exit.

37:03.414 --> 37:05.981
This is not the same stuff that the
Secretary of Defense's niece started right?

37:06.077 --> 37:09.310
Blow this, blow that, blow us all, blow.

37:09.416 --> 37:11.430
Yeah, well the blow that she took,
gave her a cardiac arrest.

37:11.526 --> 37:14.836
Yeah if we were taking that shit,
we'll be foaming at the mouth.

37:16.763 --> 37:19.679
Wake up. It's never been about the coke.

37:20.770 --> 37:21.203
What about Charlotte?

37:22.384 --> 37:24.539
The Secretary of Defense's niece!
- Are you high?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.388
There ain't no niece.

37:29.871 --> 37:33.546
Whoa! Man, that shit is strong. 
Might be feeling some side effects by now.

37:33.638 --> 37:36.665
Wax! Wax! What the fuck!
- God is doing this ride with me.

37:37.663 --> 37:38.519
I don't know what the fuck we're going!
Or what the fuck this is bout?

37:38.553 --> 37:40.126
Oh! What the fuck do you think this is about?

37:40.554 --> 37:41.755
It's about terrorists!

37:41.756 --> 37:43.968
It's about terrorists man!

37:44.253 --> 37:48.450
Converting violence into drug trading.
Moving around without being detected.

37:48.451 --> 37:50.388
It's about buying new tech explosives...

37:50.389 --> 37:54.020
which you strap on... getting children and women killed...

37:54.021 --> 37:54.770
Cats, dogs you name it.

37:54.771 --> 37:56.954
Terrorists?

37:57.563 --> 38:00.450
Oh! Shit!

38:05.810 --> 38:08.024
That's our guy.

38:08.475 --> 38:11.810
Now act the part. Like some drug addicts.

38:21.729 --> 38:23.738
Is that the guy you gonna kill?
- I didn't say I was gonna kill him.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.911
Just tell him we wanna party.
- Party?

38:27.009 --> 38:29.621
Yeah, tell him we want two big titted chicks in that building.

38:30.552 --> 38:32.583
Go ahead and tell him.

38:32.617 --> 38:34.614
Bonjour!

38:34.710 --> 38:38.345
My friend and I.
- And you would like to watch?

38:58.867 --> 39:02.582
Enjoy! They're ribbed. I got them off a Swede in Thailand.

39:02.583 --> 39:05.199
What about the pimp?
- Go for it. Whatever gets you off.

39:05.533 --> 39:08.354
How about I get off this elevator?

39:09.424 --> 39:12.861
James?
- Caroline? Caroline! Caroline!!

39:15.275 --> 39:18.945
That's the cool thing about French chicks you know?
They're not as uptight as the American girls.

39:18.946 --> 39:21.029
Well she's not very French like that, Wax!

39:21.062 --> 39:24.961
And she's definitely wanna know what
I was doing in that elevator. With you and, and her!

39:24.962 --> 39:27.485
Yeah well maybe you should be asking
her what she was doing in this part of town.

39:28.548 --> 39:32.105
She was buying fabric.
She makes her own clothes.

39:32.434 --> 39:33.114
What am I supposed to do now?
I'm totally fucked!

39:33.115 --> 39:36.112
No, not after I've told her
how you pulled the trigger saved the day.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.224
You think I'm just gonna stand here and lose
my girl while you get laid...

39:39.225 --> 39:42.080
Haven't you learned anything since we've met?

39:44.792 --> 39:48.009
Watch now, motherfucker. Move move.

39:50.139 --> 39:53.544
Halt, give me the charger.

39:54.023 --> 39:56.859
Hell! That's the big boss shit I'm looking for!

39:56.893 --> 39:59.696
Give me the charger.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.167
Faster! Faster! Faster!

40:04.354 --> 40:06.149
What the fuck are you doing man?

40:06.182 --> 40:09.947
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?
I'm charging my fucking cell.

40:15.160 --> 40:19.604
When you're done. Why don't you check
out the bank our friend is using to launder drug money.

40:20.537 --> 40:22.371
What am I looking for?
- You're looking for a Pakistani with a big bag of coke.

40:22.467 --> 40:24.954
Or a raghead pushing a wheelcart filled with cash.

40:31.499 --> 40:34.258
Unbelievable.

40:37.523 --> 40:40.263
I swear what you saw is not like what it seems.

40:40.204 --> 40:43.923
- Well it seems like you're riding up the
elevator with some hooker and her pimp.

40:44.149 --> 40:47.309
Yes, she is a hooker.
And no that guy is not her pimp.

40:47.405 --> 40:49.744
- Who the hell is he then? Tell me.

40:50.753 --> 40:53.032
You know I can't discuss my work.

40:53.065 --> 40:55.567
- Well you should probably make an exception this time, James.

41:00.702 --> 41:04.488
He's this crazy partner that they got me working with.
Okay?

41:04.521 --> 41:08.223
- What? The pimp's your partner? 
He didn't exactly look the embassy type to me.

41:08.224 --> 41:10.866
He's not. They flew him in specifically for this one job.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.141
- Well I don't like your living means working with guys like him.

41:14.747 --> 41:16.288
Caroline! I don't like it either.

41:16.289 --> 41:19.823
- Then stop doing whatever it is you're doing.
- Bring your friend for dinner if you want.

41:19.824 --> 41:23.028
- But please come home.
- Open up the door!

41:23.206 --> 41:26.898
Shit... 
- Open up.
I'll have to call you back okay.

41:28.526 --> 41:29.493
God, I love this country.

41:29.944 --> 41:32.437
And they backed their acts on this side?
- Yeah, what about the front door?

41:32.695 --> 41:37.457
Probably that Pakistan's pimp. Kill the fucker.
- I'm not gonna kill the guy Wax!

41:47.682 --> 41:50.442
And hello fucking we got customers.

42:04.963 --> 42:08.919
Now next time I'd tell you to shoot
the fucker. Shoot the fucker.

42:30.226 --> 42:32.600
Hey, Reece.

42:32.647 --> 42:33.994
You like shopping?

42:34.695 --> 42:38.219
Come on Wax! Let's just finish
the job and go home. Okay?

42:38.648 --> 42:40.952
And miss out on the finer things that Paris has to offer?

42:40.985 --> 42:42.843
What?

42:42.877 --> 42:46.706
After all this shit that we've been through,
you're just gonna let them walk?

42:46.862 --> 42:51.446
No, worries. We'll just handing them
off to the eye in the sky.

42:52.950 --> 42:55.500
- Request for level 1, satellite video surveillance.

42:55.501 --> 42:58.250
- NSA guide one track reasignment protocol for satellite repositioning.

42:58.282 --> 42:59.895
- Sending target coordinates package.

42:59.896 --> 43:04.260
- Visualize. Confirming visual identification.
Target has parked, passenger has entered building.

43:04.261 --> 43:07.192
- Transferring current location to agent for target recovery.

43:19.314 --> 43:22.036
They didn't mention I was dumping my parisian guidebook.

43:22.037 --> 43:24.441
Why would dumps here be any
different to the dumps back home?

43:24.614 --> 43:26.374
I was just figuring Paris and all you know...

43:27.329 --> 43:28.639
shithole should be nicer.

43:29.602 --> 43:32.649
I can dig it though. Brings me back to the day.

43:32.683 --> 43:36.000
Yeah! I don't remember them being particularly happy days.

43:36.518 --> 43:38.229
Now, see I woulda' figured you for a Cambridge man all the way.

43:38.964 --> 43:41.444
Cyprus Houses, East New York.

43:41.445 --> 43:42.790
No shit, really?

43:43.327 --> 43:45.349
You didn't get out much did you?
- Not really.

43:45.877 --> 43:47.843
I was the only kid to make it off my block alive though.

43:48.215 --> 43:51.005
I wish someone had locked me up.

43:51.039 --> 43:55.621
I was always wondering what guys like
you all locked up in apartments reading and shit.

43:56.719 --> 43:59.276
Mostly watching Star Trek.
- Star Trek?

43:59.277 --> 44:02.196
Dreaming of gettin out.
- Kirk or Spock?

44:02.431 --> 44:04.612
Uhura.

44:04.645 --> 44:07.244
Ahh, here we go!

44:16.067 --> 44:17.565
Hello, do you speak English?

44:18.701 --> 44:22.070
My friend and I are looking to get beamed inside.

44:22.104 --> 44:24.701
That is American dollar.

44:45.881 --> 44:49.043
Wait with them. I'll get Rashid.

44:49.542 --> 44:51.091
Don't look that one in the eye.

44:57.550 --> 45:01.434
He told you not to look that one in the eye.
- Couldn't help it I was curious.

45:02.350 --> 45:03.821
He wants us to get down on the ground.

45:05.602 --> 45:09.036
What the hell are you doing?
- Let me give you a little advice where I picked up in Somalia.

45:08.975 --> 45:12.832
When a shady ten-year old points a gun to your face,
you do whenever the fucks he wants. Now get down here.

45:12.696 --> 45:14.604
He just wants our bling.

45:17.927 --> 45:20.474
You feeling homesick yet?
- Fuck no, it's fake.

45:20.475 --> 45:22.913
Well this isn't. Caroline's father gave it to her.

45:23.736 --> 45:26.591
I swear that girl's gonna get you killed.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.859
Looks better on me?
- Definitely.

45:45.893 --> 45:47.496
- Thank you.

45:50.951 --> 45:54.028
For you fifty dollars.

45:57.034 --> 45:59.500
Hey what the fuck are you doing?
- That's good shit...

45:59.798 --> 46:02.279
That's Colombian mixed with a little flour? Right?

46:02.836 --> 46:05.731
Now give me a kilo?
- A kilo?

46:06.491 --> 46:08.054
You think this is Bogota?
- What the fuck am I gonna do with 5 grams?

46:08.055 --> 46:10.798
Maybe you can sniff it off your homeboy's ass?

46:15.163 --> 46:20.933
Now maybe you can get off your jive ass
and hook me up with the player that can hook us up.

46:20.934 --> 46:24.302
Five grams, is considered personal
consumption. That! they can get away with.

46:25.190 --> 46:27.262
Anything more than a kilo and it's 15 years in prison.

46:27.562 --> 46:31.927
Hmm! But wouldn't it be a shame for these motherfuckers to get caught for 5 kilos of their own shit.

46:33.322 --> 46:36.883
Got caught with 5 kilos of their own shit!

46:47.459 --> 46:50.760
Thank you.

46:51.453 --> 46:54.754
Give me the fucking ring. Give me the ring!
- Yeah, yeah.

46:54.788 --> 46:56.970
That's it, that's it!

46:57.133 --> 47:00.041
Give me back my fucking ring.

47:00.137 --> 47:03.517
Tell us where the Pakistanis are,
or I'll have him take you for another round.

47:03.551 --> 47:06.309
Give it to me, get that fucking ring off your finger.

47:07.335 --> 47:12.181
Oh yeah, boy.

47:12.217 --> 47:15.423
Better get in that apartment right
over where the Pakistani's staying...

47:16.241 --> 47:19.415
or you're gonna be..
what's the math on him?

47:20.075 --> 47:23.328
He's gonna be like the 26th guy in the last 24 hours.
Hey! That's about a guy an hour.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.435
It all ads up. Go!

47:37.161 --> 47:40.496
Relax old man I'm not gonna hurt you. We'll be gone in five minutes.

47:40.497 --> 47:43.144
Why should I worry? My age there's nothing to worry about.

47:43.240 --> 47:47.449
You do outlaw deals, you should be the one to worry.

47:47.643 --> 47:50.240
Mint tea?
- Why the hell not.

47:50.336 --> 47:52.309
You think it was that different back in your day?

47:52.310 --> 47:54.975
It is just as evil...

47:55.570 --> 47:58.426
but it is a lot less polite.

48:00.416 --> 48:06.256
Alright. Okay Rashid. Let's see what kind of
trouble your buddies are brewing up down there.

48:16.076 --> 48:18.810
How's it look?
- About six. They're closing up shop.

48:18.906 --> 48:22.205
Okay. Tell you what we're gonna do.

48:22.238 --> 48:25.477
I am gonna take the scenic route.

48:25.511 --> 48:29.166
And you, my friend, are gonna go downstairs to the tenth floor...

48:29.200 --> 48:33.790
and shoot anybody that comes through that door.
You'll gonna need this to keep in touch.

48:35.743 --> 48:38.725
Thanks.

48:38.892 --> 48:42.551
That's good shit. How do I get some?
- You can't. It's home grown nana.

48:42.584 --> 48:45.152
Thanks for your hospitality old man.

48:46.748 --> 48:49.026
Let's go.

49:12.554 --> 49:15.250
Are you in position? 
- Yeah! You want me inside?

49:19.186 --> 49:20.912
Hell no!

49:21.738 --> 49:23.690
They got the door wired!

49:46.508 --> 49:50.132
They're going down to the ninth floor.
Cut them off.

50:01.883 --> 50:03.036
Freeze.
shut the fuck down.

50:03.037 --> 50:05.411
Get down, down!

50:05.281 --> 50:07.588
Get down.

50:14.466 --> 50:16.553
No!

50:28.790 --> 50:32.315
Nice work, Reece.
- What's so nice about it?

50:32.316 --> 50:34.612
How bout the fact that he's dead and you're alive.
Alright, how many got out?

50:36.314 --> 50:39.363
Two, maybe three.
You're not gonna catch them now, Wax!

50:48.208 --> 50:51.577
How much time you think would
take to run down nine floors of stairs?

50:51.116 --> 50:54.830
I have no idea, Wax?
- Maybe about six seconds a floor?

50:54.831 --> 50:56.802
That sounds right?
- Yeah sure.

50:56.803 --> 50:58.642
Now take 54 seconds.

51:00.814 --> 51:03.348
To get down there.

51:15.302 --> 51:19.024
And five seconds to cross the lobby.

51:18.031 --> 51:21.978
And four seconds to get to the car.

51:36.727 --> 51:40.354
And then there was none.

51:46.435 --> 51:48.115
The cops will be here soon.

51:48.116 --> 51:50.012
Damn this place is driping with intel.

51:50.013 --> 51:51.013
Come on, help.

51:56.116 --> 51:58.234
Come on!

52:50.323 --> 52:52.775
Hey Reece,
- We need to get out of here Wax.

52:52.776 --> 52:54.462
Get in here. Check this out.

52:54.463 --> 52:58.636
I don't want anything more to do with this place Wax!
- Well you got more to do with this than you think.

53:10.989 --> 53:15.177
- What the fuck!
Yeah that was what I was wondering.
- Why? You suddenly run out of explanations!

53:15.178 --> 53:16.462
You don't know where this is headin?

53:16.463 --> 53:18.920
Fuck! I'll just following the bouncing
ball right now that leads to you.

53:19.531 --> 53:22.739
Hey! I got nothing to do with this Wax.
- Yeah! Well that's not what the evidence tells us.

53:24.075 --> 53:26.053
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

53:32.987 --> 53:35.546
They're headin to the tenth floor. The
door's rigged. They'll be blown to pieces.

53:35.547 --> 53:37.380
NO!

53:37.387 --> 53:40.503
It's not a fucking option you go out there.
You go out there and drag us into it. It's over.

53:40.504 --> 53:42.080
They are just a bunch of cops doing their jobs.

53:42.081 --> 53:45.181
We don't finish our job, thousands of people are getting killed.
You got that.

53:45.182 --> 53:47.950
That's the point. We're supposed
to protect people not let them die.

53:47.961 --> 53:49.957
Look! There's no time for a body count. It's too late.

53:50.626 --> 53:52.354
It's not too late for them.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.575
Reece!
- Yes!

54:07.382 --> 54:08.206
Get up.

54:29.672 --> 54:31.887
Reece! Police car get in.

54:41.295 --> 54:44.603
Wait! wait, wait stop I've gotta get my stuff.
- They knew we were coming, I'm sure it's checked by now.

54:44.604 --> 54:45.990
Look! My prints were all over that car.

54:45.991 --> 54:49.060
The cops will trace it back to the embassy and to me in no time.

54:51.519 --> 54:53.483
FUCK! Okay let me get get... Let me get my head around this...

54:53.484 --> 54:55.065
You wanna stop in the middle of our getaway...

54:55.066 --> 54:58.386
so you can grab your plates, wipe your prints and
grab some files!

54:58.386 --> 55:00.293
I'll be quick...
Alright quicker than this!

55:04.554 --> 55:07.987
Wax, wax, wax no!

55:13.090 --> 55:16.238
What the fuck Wax?
- A fucking boom.

55:16.239 --> 55:18.131
Work for you?

55:18.059 --> 55:19.059
You're fucking crazy.

55:30.598 --> 55:33.843
You did good today Reece.
Helped to save the world a little bit.

55:37.923 --> 55:41.132
Why don't you have a seat here
and reflect our eventful day.

55:41.207 --> 55:44.062
I'm gonna shoot the shit with these trenchcoats.

56:06.492 --> 56:08.771
What's the deal with the bag?

56:09.259 --> 56:12.854
What they got in this bag,will get me killed one day.

56:12.894 --> 56:15.429
You look pretty bulletproof to me.

56:16.251 --> 56:17.991
Reece, every man has got his vices.

56:17.992 --> 56:23.713
And in my case the locals call my vice "A Royal with cheese".

56:31.474 --> 56:34.319
So the job's finished?
We can go home?

56:34.320 --> 56:35.918
Not til the trenchcoats call us and tell us we can.

56:39.278 --> 56:43.514
What if it's never over, Wax?
What if we can't beat these guys?

56:43.799 --> 56:47.265
Why don't you ask the guy you
shot what it feels like to win?

56:50.619 --> 56:53.796
I didn't shoot him. I couldn't pull the trigger.

56:55.019 --> 56:57.777
I know you didn't.

56:58.217 --> 56:59.977
But it's okay, it's not going in your report.

57:00.937 --> 57:04.100
Well maybe it should.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

57:04.101 --> 57:06.790
No! That's exactly why you need to stay in it.
To keep guys like me honest.

57:08.147 --> 57:10.325
You don't need me, Wax.

57:10.326 --> 57:14.594
Oh! You fucking kidding!
Tell me we're not a perfect match.

57:26.539 --> 57:30.793
Dinner?
- Why the hell not.

57:40.394 --> 57:44.310
I brought my friend Charles for dinner.
- Hi, Nicole.

57:50.550 --> 57:52.558
- Where have you been all day?

57:52.559 --> 57:57.534
So you have to tell me something. 
What do you do when you're not busy making men's jaw drop?

57:58.479 --> 58:00.304
That might work with girls from the red light district.

58:01.263 --> 58:03.472
So what the hell were you thinking
taking Reece to some hooker.

58:03.483 --> 58:05.924
Didn't you know they got engaged last night.
- Sure!

58:05.925 --> 58:10.274
Talked about it all day.
I'd had to pickup a fabric shipment...

58:10.275 --> 58:13.444
You know I'm a rag importer.
We got a little business on the side...

58:13.445 --> 58:17.012
but you know I spend most of my money on cars
and women.

58:17.108 --> 58:19.836
Not in that order I hope.

58:19.837 --> 58:20.548
Excuse me.

58:21.175 --> 58:22.040
Yup.

58:22.041 --> 58:22.863
Gotta go change okay

58:24.034 --> 58:26.408
Hold on.

58:37.083 --> 58:39.297
Yeah I'm listening.

58:45.977 --> 58:47.850
Alright so!

58:47.851 --> 58:48.397
Where were we?

58:48.398 --> 58:51.381
You were telling my friend what fabric you and 
my fiancee was picking up when I saw you.

58:52.543 --> 58:56.133
Ah well I am not really in the clothing business.

58:57.039 --> 59:00.366
I'm actually in the cloak and dagger division of the embassy.

59:00.400 --> 59:03.028
Like my boy here.
- Mostly cloak!

59:03.062 --> 59:06.432
Mostly dagger.
- Hmm! Killed anyone today?

59:07.834 --> 59:11.394
Oh let's see. About bout one an hour average, I'd say.

59:13.286 --> 59:15.554
And what type of people did you kill today, James?

59:16.764 --> 59:17.597
You know, the usual. Bad guys.

59:18.678 --> 59:25.160
Bad guys, baddest ass suicide destined,
cold hearted Pakistanis, motherfucker the south of Carachi.

59:27.894 --> 59:31.276
Now, wow! Seriously I mean we took down a whole
terrorist cell today. Tell them!

59:32.698 --> 59:34.947
That's what we were doing in the elevator
when you saw us.

59:35.792 --> 59:36.259
Truth.

59:37.651 --> 59:40.704
He's being modest.
Tell them how you saved the day.

59:39.504 --> 59:42.948
I helped.
- Did you at least catch them all?

59:43.303 --> 59:46.705
Not sure, but
we'll find out soon enough. Alright!

59:46.739 --> 59:49.401
Let's party.

59:58.903 --> 01:00:01.498
What did you think that was?

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:07.695
I like this girl!

01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:09.714
Excuse me.

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.280
Hello?

01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:15.907
Who? No I'm sorry, there's no Rose here.

01:00:18.902 --> 01:00:20.560
Wrong number.

01:00:22.346 --> 01:00:25.426
That's the call we've been waiting for.

01:00:25.603 --> 01:00:30.630
What the fuck? What the fuck Wax?
- Shut the fuck up right now and you listen to me.

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:35.393
Rose was a codeword. Nicole's number on every
Pakistani cellphone that we found.

01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:38.055
She's a pakistani you stupid fuck
doesn't mean she's a terrrorist!

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:40.806
It does when she is your best friend and you got him living
in an apartment thats bugged?

01:00:41.432 --> 01:00:43.290
What the hell are you talking about Wax?

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:46.426
Yeah I'll show you what I am talking about.
You stay right there! Don't you fucking move!

01:00:46.787 --> 01:00:47.908
Watch this.

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:59.210
There. Here.

01:00:59.211 --> 01:01:02.203
How much you wanna
bet she's got a dozen buried around here?

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.406
What? You were the one who rented the apartment!

01:01:07.895 --> 01:01:10.890
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!
Before we started dating...

01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:13.983
I had her completely checked.
She's totally clean, Wax!

01:01:14.348 --> 01:01:17.493
What? You have me checked out?
- Obviously not enough.

01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:20.189
She's working for the fucking people who
took your picture man!

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:23.044
I don't believe you.
You've got the wrong girl! Wax!

01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:24.310
You'll got the wrong girl!

01:01:25.311 --> 01:01:26.632
What are you wearing right now that she gave you?
- Nothing.

01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:29.614
Your ring, man! That's how they've been tracking us!

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.878
C'mon give it over, I'll prove to you.
I'll give you my gun. Give me the fucking ring.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.107
Give me the ring, give me the fucking ring I'll prove it to you.
- DON'T!

01:01:37.263 --> 01:01:39.023
Don't, please. Please.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:54.614
Oh don't you dare. Don't you dare point that at me.
You point that at her.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:02:02.177
Alright this'll how it works. If there's a transmission
in the ring, it'll interfere with the stereo. See that!

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:13.787
Why, Caroline?

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:27.047
Reece, you good?
- My shoulder.

01:02:27.048 --> 01:02:29.518
I told you that fucking chick will get you killed!

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:46.168
Volvo, green, 92MPR75.

01:04:07.173 --> 01:04:10.593
Oh! There's one more.
- There you go 17 microphones.

01:04:10.594 --> 01:04:12.760
Five cameras, two in your bedroom.

01:04:12.785 --> 01:04:15.407
That's impossible. Caroline couldn't even screw in a lightbulb.

01:04:15.408 --> 01:04:17.727
Whoever put this shit in knew what they were doing.

01:04:18.019 --> 01:04:21.750
Hope you got some good moves on you buddy boy if
it gets on Youtube.

01:04:26.861 --> 01:04:29.665
I fucked up.
- No, you're just in love man.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:33.440
Love is always a bitch.
- Yeah! What do you know about love?

01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:36.329
Well, once in Congo, twice in Beirut.

01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:38.794
Same girl. I ain't made of stone.
No matter what you think.

01:04:41.452 --> 01:04:44.620
C'mon think about it, where could she be?
Family, friends...

01:04:44.621 --> 01:04:47.717
She never talked about her life.
And I never thought to ask.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:50.095
I don't know anything about this girl, Wax.

01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:54.231
How did I miss this?

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:57.883
I need word on that Volvo.
We need to find this girl.

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:08.305
Got it? You're on.

01:05:08.306 --> 01:05:11.800
Hello.
- Please don't bother tracing I will be off in a minute.

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:15.109
I'm sorry it came to this, I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:05:15.797 --> 01:05:17.939
- You need to understand.
Then help me.

01:05:18.392 --> 01:05:22.453
Because I don't know what the hell's going on.
- Just tell me the truth Caroline.

01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:36.179
Six years ago I met a man
who opened my eyes to his fate.

01:05:36.573 --> 01:05:38.068
- And finally for the first time in my life...

01:05:40.196 --> 01:05:41.339
- everything made sense.
I knew I had a purpose.

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:46.254
To lie to me?
To shoot me?

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.432
To serve my cause.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:54.222
And living with me and spying on me?
That was all part of your plan?

01:05:55.842 --> 01:05:58.759
- Caroline?
Caroline!

01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:03.133
She's gone. Did you get a lock on it?

01:06:03.134 --> 01:06:06.698
No it's too short. 
- It's okay. Play it back.
Crop her voice down, bring up the background.

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:48.324
- Six years ago I met a man
who opened my eyes to his fate.

01:06:48.325 --> 01:06:49.409
Good, good, louder, louder.

01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:52.655
- And finally for the first time...

01:06:52.689 --> 01:06:55.118
- everything made...
Where is that?

01:06:56.968 --> 01:06:58.291
Might be ... the Paris Peripherique (Paris Expressway).

01:06:58.568 --> 01:06:59.758
They're leaving Paris. Where're they going?

01:07:00.706 --> 01:07:03.015
Ambassador Bennington.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:06.076
Yes, sir.
- God damn what are you doing?

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:10.001
The delegation just landed, Reece.
Why the hell aren't you at the airport to greet them?

01:07:25.304 --> 01:07:28.866
The American delegation just
landed for the U.S. - African Aid summit.

01:07:28.524 --> 01:07:29.843
They're gonna hit the delegation. Who's driving?
- That would be me Sir.

01:07:29.842 --> 01:07:32.100
C'mon let's go.
Move quick!

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:32.944
Wait a sec.

01:07:32.977 --> 01:07:35.675
Is that it? Don't you wanna think
about this for a second, Wax?

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:37.791
You think about it, you're the chess player.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:05.164
Ohhh... I love this song.

01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:13.675
Don't you say anything about this.
It's between us.

01:08:58.223 --> 01:09:01.303
Are you okay sir?
Huh?

01:09:01.584 --> 01:09:04.899
I don't know. Something's wrong here.

01:09:04.993 --> 01:09:06.393
It doesn't make sense.

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:11.068
If they wanted to hit the delegation,
then why did they wire THIS apartment?

01:09:11.163 --> 01:09:14.062
Why'd they use me?

01:09:20.258 --> 01:09:24.107
All Paris bound lanes have been blocked off.
We will reach the motorcade in a few minutes.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.054
Nah, those fuckers want to strike on the freeway.
They shouldn't be far.

01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:35.018
There he is. Go! GO! Floor it!

01:10:31.003 --> 01:10:33.130
This isn't going to slow him down.
Do you have any heavy metal?

01:10:33.131 --> 01:10:34.546
How about this?

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:40.163
Ohhhh... Come to daddy.

01:11:04.489 --> 01:11:07.440
"African aid summit
come together in Paris, France"

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.563
Closer!

01:11:35.809 --> 01:11:40.046
I'm a little busy, Reece.

01:11:40.498 --> 01:11:42.096
She is not inside that car.
- What?

01:11:42.193 --> 01:11:45.354
What are you talking about. I can
see her in the passenger seat.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:48.515
Listen to me she is not inside that car.

01:11:48.611 --> 01:11:51.396
She is entering the summit
as a delegate.

01:11:51.533 --> 01:11:54.869
What? Are you sure?
Because I can see her from here.

01:11:58.174 --> 01:12:00.649
Wax, Wax! the Volvo was probably a diversion.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.589
- Make sure you get a visual contact,
Before you take your shot.

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:06.679
Move closer. I gotta look inside!

01:12:14.517 --> 01:12:16.310
Ah fuck, you're right. She's not there.

01:12:16.311 --> 01:12:18.930
Shit I'm on my way to the summit.
- Okay, I will be behind you!

01:12:19.026 --> 01:12:21.376
I gotta clean this shit up.

01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:51.351
Have them turn the motorcade around!

01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:55.866
Yes? 

01:12:55.867 --> 01:12:56.993
Excuse me, Maam...

01:12:57.531 --> 01:13:02.089
There's intel of a potential threat.
They want us to change our course.

01:13:03.134 --> 01:13:05.099
Negative.

01:13:05.372 --> 01:13:07.682
Is she turned?

01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:08.585
FUCK!

01:13:25.062 --> 01:13:28.109
Pass them up. Get me on the bridge.

01:14:09.747 --> 01:14:12.986
Come on, baby. One shot.

01:14:18.908 --> 01:14:22.823
Get down! Now! Get down!

01:14:55.104 --> 01:14:58.535
Welcome to Paris, baby.

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:12.947
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.889
Wax! Look she's probably wearing one of those shock activated vest.
- Like the ones we found in that apartment?

01:15:19.923 --> 01:15:21.411
No way, she wouldn't do that.

01:15:21.507 --> 01:15:23.822
The bitch ain't going to the summit to make some speech. Reece!

01:15:23.823 --> 01:15:27.332
If I can find her. I'll talk to her.
- Yeah, she'll blow your fucking head off. OK!

01:15:27.365 --> 01:15:30.084
Now you'll gonna have to aim up high,
where there's no vest.

01:15:30.085 --> 01:15:31.114
Do you understand what I am saying?

01:15:32.354 --> 01:15:33.849
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying?

01:15:34.306 --> 01:15:36.176
Okay I got it.
- Good.

01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:40.729
Talking ain't gonna do the job man.
- You're gonna have to take that shot.

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:41.700
Damn.

01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:50.189
Access denied
- I'm sorry sir, I can't let you in.

01:15:50.222 --> 01:15:52.724
Can you please try again sir.

01:15:54.168 --> 01:15:58.066
Sir? this card has already used by
Ambassador Bennington's assistant.

01:15:58.162 --> 01:16:02.094
That's impossible. I am Ambassador 
Bennington's personal aid.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.932
Please come with me sir.
- Look I can explain this.

01:16:05.014 --> 01:16:07.858
I think my girlfriend stole my card to get into the summit...

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:10.500
If you'll just give me a minute.

01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:13.421
Ambassador Bennington!

01:16:13.454 --> 01:16:16.150
What in fool's for God's sake, he's my personal aid!

01:16:16.952 --> 01:16:19.165
Give me that.
- Where the hell have you been?

01:16:19.198 --> 01:16:21.760
Are you aware of what happened
to the delegation on the freeway?

01:16:21.856 --> 01:16:24.695
I need to talk to you right now sir.
- So what is going on?

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:26.997
Weapon!

01:16:30.494 --> 01:16:33.577
Reece, since when did you carry a gun?

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.565
There's a suicide bomber inside the Embassy.

01:16:36.661 --> 01:16:41.345
There's been absolutely no intel on that.
- I'm telling you. You need to clear this conference. Right now.

01:16:41.518 --> 01:16:45.384
I can't shut down the summit on the vague assumption...
- This is not an assumption.

01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:49.622
I know the bomber. Sir.
She's my fiancee.

01:16:49.847 --> 01:16:53.896
Your fiancee?
- She's been using me as a cover all along.

01:16:56.642 --> 01:16:59.947
Are you sure she is in here?

01:17:02.047 --> 01:17:05.352
No, I'm not.

01:17:04.672 --> 01:17:07.403
Mr. Ambassador, the delegates are about to arrive.

01:17:07.499 --> 01:17:09.609
Let him go.
- Not with a weapon.

01:17:11.621 --> 01:17:14.685
Thank you, sir. Excuse me.

01:17:44.366 --> 01:17:47.158
Caroline!

01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:17.917
Get down Sir!

01:18:17.341 --> 01:18:20.484
Get down!

01:18:21.428 --> 01:18:23.364
Drop the weapon Sir!
- Caroline!

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:27.078
I need you to drop the weapon sir!
- Caroline! Don't move.

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:31.250
I do not want to do this. I do not want to shoot you.

01:18:31.283 --> 01:18:34.748
I need you to lay your weapon down now Sir!

01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:41.885
Lay your weapon down Sir!

01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:46.682
Put your weapon down Sir!

01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:52.254
Drop the weapon!

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:57.823
No, no, no! Do not shoot! That vest might explode.

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:07.708
Caroline, please...

01:19:07.741 --> 01:19:10.178
Let me help you.

01:19:13.676 --> 01:19:16.211
I don't need any help.

01:19:18.368 --> 01:19:21.642
I am at peace.

01:19:24.042 --> 01:19:27.122
Caroline, this isn't peace.

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.158
You told me before, the reason you did all this is...

01:19:32.254 --> 01:19:37.001
to find a purpose. Try to make sense of it all.

01:19:38.766 --> 01:19:42.316
Well, That's all I want too, Caroline.

01:19:43.341 --> 01:19:46.564
No, no, please. Don't do this.

01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:48.573
Just listen to me.

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.906
Just for a minute. Just listen to me.

01:19:57.272 --> 01:20:00.801
Nothing else in the world matters right now Caroline,

01:20:01.558 --> 01:20:04.764
except I love you.

01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.119
- And that's all I have.

01:20:09.656 --> 01:20:11.990
- Love for you.

01:20:18.585 --> 01:20:21.784
- And even if you don't love me...

01:20:21.534 --> 01:20:25.781
- that's all the sense any of us is ever gonna get.

01:20:28.028 --> 01:20:30.038
Love.

01:20:30.605 --> 01:20:33.473
Love.

01:21:50.758 --> 01:21:54.582
What the hell is going on?
I did not fly ten freaking hours to get my ass melting in this limo.

01:21:54.678 --> 01:21:59.858
I'm sure it's for your own safety maam.
- You always say when you don't have a clue about what's going on.

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:05.949
Wax! Wax, for Christ's sakes. Can you explain to her what's going on.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:09.246
Excuse me, maam. I'm very sorry there's been a security problem...

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:11.055
that's been handled and you're free to go.

01:22:11.089 --> 01:22:12.822
Have a nice evening.

01:22:16.374 --> 01:22:20.589
I want to know who's responsible for this delay
and I want him fired.

01:22:23.799 --> 01:22:27.926
That's what I like about the job.
You get acknowledged, you get compliments.

01:22:33.876 --> 01:22:37.919
Here, I got you a little something to keep you going.
Wherever it is you are going.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.549
Yeah?

01:22:41.312 --> 01:22:42.147
Yeah, man.

01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:43.824
You know I got this sense...

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:46.729
that you're gonna take your act on the road pretty soon here.

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:49.535
Courtesy of the very appreciative government.

01:22:49.568 --> 01:22:53.627
But I must tell you that I wouldn't be against your coming with me.

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:58.380
I gotta get back to the apartment, Wax.
Got so many things...

01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:01.369
Ehhhh that apartment's been, packed up and shipped out.

01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:03.558
But I think I know what you are looking for.

01:23:12.222 --> 01:23:17.983
Something to remember her by.
- Thanks, Wax.

01:23:18.713 --> 01:23:19.361
C'mon let's play a little chess game before I go.

01:23:19.362 --> 01:23:21.912
I thought you were the kinda guy who didn't like playing chess?

01:23:22.567 --> 01:23:24.324
I lied. Sue me.

01:23:24.325 --> 01:23:27.142
Okay, but I gonna warn you I don't take prisoners.

01:23:28.797 --> 01:23:30.184
Oh well I'm gonna warn you! I am a VERY sore loser.

01:23:31.162 --> 01:23:34.075
Okay well if that's the case.
- No shit!

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:36.676
Yeah, man.

01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:40.981
Damn, welcome to the club. Pard!
- Oh, you are going down, you are so going down.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.630
Listen Hoss! Let me tell tell you something. What
I actually got about this game, you won't even learned yet.

01:23:47.516 --> 01:23:50.386
Really?
- Yeah, I'm just talking.
