01:07.373 --> 01:08.431
<i>When I was a child,</i>

01:08.507 --> 01:10.134
<i>my mother would
tell me a story</i>

01:10.209 --> 01:12.507
<i>about how
the Devil roams the Earth.</i>

01:14.714 --> 01:17.979
<i>Sometimes, she said,
he would take human form</i>

01:18.050 --> 01:21.611
<i>so he could punish the damned on
Earth before claiming their souls.</i>

01:24.023 --> 01:26.218
<i>The ones he chose
would be gathered together</i>

01:26.292 --> 01:31.195
<i>and tortured as he hid amongst
them, pretending to be one of them.</i>

01:32.698 --> 01:36.031
<i>I always believed my mother was
telling me an old wives' tale.</i>

03:33.450 --> 03:36.419
<i>My mother's story would
always begin the same way,</i>

03:36.553 --> 03:40.489
<i>with a suicide paving the
way for the Devil's arrival.</i>

03:44.228 --> 03:48.324
<i>And it would always end with
the deaths of all those trapped.</i>

04:08.351 --> 04:10.876
<i>I'm good. I feel good. I feel amazing.</i>

04:13.289 --> 04:15.780
You know the main reason why
people go back to drinking?

04:15.858 --> 04:16.882
No.

04:16.959 --> 04:17.983
Guess.

04:18.427 --> 04:19.916
The Eagles.

04:20.663 --> 04:21.857
Resentment.

04:22.465 --> 04:25.127
Are we seriously
talking about this again?

04:25.301 --> 04:26.666
<i>It's important.</i>

04:26.836 --> 04:28.633
Your ability to forgive
is gonna determine

04:28.704 --> 04:32.196
the quality of the rest of your
life more than anything else.

04:33.910 --> 04:36.276
Look, some things
are beyond forgiveness.

04:36.579 --> 04:38.012
<i>You're already
on your way.</i>

04:38.080 --> 04:39.741
<i>You've taken responsibility
for your actions.</i>

04:39.815 --> 04:41.783
<i>That's more than half
the battle right there.</i>

04:42.251 --> 04:43.775
But to truly feel free,

04:46.155 --> 04:47.850
you may need to
finally start believing

04:47.924 --> 04:49.858
in something
greater than yourself.

04:50.426 --> 04:51.723
That sounds good.

04:53.629 --> 04:54.960
It does.

04:55.765 --> 04:58.928
But when I think about the
guy that killed my family,

05:00.369 --> 05:03.065
I have a tough time
believing in much of anything.

05:03.773 --> 05:07.106
<i>I'm just saying,
leave yourself open to it.</i>

05:08.044 --> 05:11.707
Can we just have breakfast for once?

05:12.081 --> 05:13.343
Talk about normal stuff.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.007
<i>I'm your sponsor. You can
talk about normal stuff</i>

05:15.083 --> 05:16.175
with everybody else.

05:22.724 --> 05:25.386
Hey. Got a good one
for you.

05:25.460 --> 05:26.518
Yeah?

05:51.252 --> 05:52.514
<i>Yeah, it doesn't
make sense, right?</i>

05:53.221 --> 05:56.315
A guy hits a truck with this kind
of force from a two-story building?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.051
Definitely a jumper.

05:58.193 --> 05:59.524
<i>Are you sure
he wasn't thrown?</i>

05:59.628 --> 06:01.619
<i>He's got
a rosary in his hand.</i>

06:02.964 --> 06:05.524
Not the kind of thing
you grab in a panic.

06:05.834 --> 06:06.926
Right.

06:11.106 --> 06:12.505
Elsa.
Bowden.

06:12.874 --> 06:13.863
Hi.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.051
<i>There's no glass
on the ground.</i>

06:30.457 --> 06:34.188
<i>The truck wasn't here when he
made impact. It must have rolled.</i>

06:35.195 --> 06:36.253
Uh-huh.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.935
Your guy jumped
from that building.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.838
And what? Your dead guy
turned the corner, here?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.037
These things are made
to bounce trucks off.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.243
You got to be
kidding me.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.209
<i>Let's walk it.</i>

06:59.286 --> 07:00.446
Yeah.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.452
Larson.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.007
Hey! Hey, lady,
you got to sign in.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.140
<i>Oh. Where's Ramsey?
He knows me.</i>

07:58.311 --> 08:00.074
<i>Ramsey's out sick.
You got me.</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:01.875
And that means
you gotta sign in.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.881
I mean, do I look like such a threat?

08:06.586 --> 08:09.919
<i>Don't blame me.
They got procedures.</i>

08:11.424 --> 08:13.324
Keep dreaming, dawg.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.528
You have to
cover the sign in.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.830
Some lawyers on 39
need this right away.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.003
<i>You're not taking
the stairs again.</i>

08:25.071 --> 08:26.538
What else am I gonna
do to stay in shape?

08:26.706 --> 08:29.402
To 39? Just get on
the damn elevator.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.535
Come in.

08:33.613 --> 08:34.909
<i>It's too tight
for me.</i>

08:35.114 --> 08:36.308
You can squeeze in.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.506
No.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.998
Hold, please.

08:58.703 --> 09:00.034
Thank you.

09:00.438 --> 09:02.201
Forty-two, please.

09:02.274 --> 09:03.298
You bet.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.303
Now, see,
this I can do.

09:06.011 --> 09:07.103
Could you hold that?

09:07.179 --> 09:08.203
Uh. Sorry.

09:10.248 --> 09:11.579
Thanks for your help.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.081
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

09:56.161 --> 09:57.821
Uh-uh,
this is not good.

09:58.762 --> 10:00.423
Oh, come on, man.

10:00.531 --> 10:02.089
<i>Don't do this.</i>

10:14.511 --> 10:16.502
Come on, Timonen,
put a stick on it.

10:16.814 --> 10:18.042
How we doing?

10:18.115 --> 10:19.946
Same score.

10:22.019 --> 10:23.680
Thanks.
Yeah.

10:29.126 --> 10:31.617
Why is elevator six
in inspection mode?

10:32.463 --> 10:34.431
Huh?
Elevator six.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.262
A full house.
Two queens, three jacks.

10:46.443 --> 10:47.910
Call Dwight.
Yeah.

10:48.512 --> 10:49.877
Yo, Dwight,
you got a problem.

10:51.015 --> 10:54.178
<i>Tell me about it. I'm
already up on 35 fixing it.</i>

10:54.685 --> 10:56.243
The elevator?

10:56.387 --> 10:57.945
<i>No, the broken window.</i>

10:58.389 --> 10:59.651
<i>You're not
fixing the elevator?</i>

10:59.723 --> 11:01.748
Screen says six is
on inspection mode.

11:01.825 --> 11:03.156
<i>We got people
stuck in there.</i>

11:03.227 --> 11:04.489
<i>Are you sure you're
reading that right?</i>

11:04.561 --> 11:06.586
<i>Your eyes ain't
what they used to be.</i>

11:07.664 --> 11:09.393
<i>You know what? I'll ask
your mom to read it for me</i>

11:09.465 --> 11:12.229
next time I got her
bent over the console.

11:13.036 --> 11:15.231
<i>My mom's 78.
Have at it.</i>

11:15.305 --> 11:16.397
Ooh!

11:17.006 --> 11:18.667
Yeah. Listen, buddy, just
go up to the machine room

11:18.741 --> 11:20.333
and check it out, okay?

11:20.576 --> 11:21.804
<i>On my way.</i>

11:38.194 --> 11:40.185
Just trying to get
something to jump-start it.

11:40.263 --> 11:42.663
<i>Don't you have
emergency procedures?</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:46.093
<i>I don't know, I'm just a temp.
I just started working here.</i>

11:46.536 --> 11:48.527
<i>Well, don't you
service these things?</i>

11:48.838 --> 11:50.897
Try hitting
the emergency button.

11:56.946 --> 11:59.346
<i>Don't you
keep up your equipment?</i>

12:01.050 --> 12:03.041
<i>I don't know.
Like I said...</i>

12:03.152 --> 12:04.414
<i>Don't you have
a walkie-talkie?</i>

12:04.587 --> 12:07.181
<i>No. I didn't think
I'd need it.</i>

12:07.290 --> 12:09.087
<i>Don't you think it would have
been... Won't you shut up?</i>

12:09.158 --> 12:10.420
Yeah, take it easy.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.227
I mean, seriously!

12:12.395 --> 12:13.760
<i>You don't have
a walkie-talkie?</i>

12:14.364 --> 12:15.888
<i>Hey, people,
we see you in there.</i>

12:15.965 --> 12:16.989
<i>We're stuck!</i>

12:17.066 --> 12:19.693
<i>Hang tough, we got the
building engineer on his way.</i>

12:19.835 --> 12:22.463
<i>When was the last time you
heard somebody say "hang tough"?</i>

12:22.671 --> 12:26.234
<i>What did you say?
Nothing.</i>

12:26.608 --> 12:27.905
Is he picking a fight?

12:28.010 --> 12:30.069
<i>Can one of you look
towards the camera</i>

12:30.145 --> 12:32.636
<i>and say something
loud and clear, please?</i>

12:34.149 --> 12:37.550
Your building sucks!

12:38.286 --> 12:39.378
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

12:39.454 --> 12:41.513
The speaker in the car is
supposed to let us talk both ways,

12:41.623 --> 12:42.817
but you can hear me?

12:42.891 --> 12:44.358
<i>It's working on
this end, yeah!</i>

12:44.459 --> 12:46.086
<i>He just said
he can't hear us,</i>

12:46.161 --> 12:47.753
<i>didn't say
we should talk louder.</i>

12:47.896 --> 12:50.592
<i>Okay, um,
give us a sec.</i>

12:51.066 --> 12:53.364
Well, this is reassuring.

12:56.705 --> 12:58.366
I got to be somewhere.

13:02.577 --> 13:04.306
<i>You're not gonna
get a signal in here.</i>

13:04.679 --> 13:08.012
<i>I just need to call my job so
I don't get fired over this.</i>

13:09.885 --> 13:11.546
Typical bullshit.

13:11.853 --> 13:13.548
<i>Do any of y'all
have a signal?</i>

13:13.822 --> 13:15.221
<i>I've got one bar.</i>

13:30.538 --> 13:33.200
Hello? This is Larson.

13:34.108 --> 13:37.441
Can you please connect me to
my job at the security desk?

13:38.879 --> 13:39.971
Can you hear me?

13:40.047 --> 13:42.072
Tell them to
get us out of here!

13:42.650 --> 13:43.810
Hello?

13:49.123 --> 13:51.182
<i>They'll just have to deal.</i>

13:52.159 --> 13:54.059
Well, at least
we got tunes.

13:55.262 --> 13:59.164
<i>Don't sit under that apple
tree with anyone else but me</i>

13:59.233 --> 14:00.222
Come on, grandma,
you know the words.

14:00.534 --> 14:02.024
<i>Anyone else but me</i>

14:02.103 --> 14:03.730
<i>Don't be a jerk.</i>

14:04.338 --> 14:07.307
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Miss Manners.</i>

14:07.374 --> 14:09.365
Did I offend your
noble sensibilities?

14:09.477 --> 14:10.603
<i>Why don't you
lay off, pal?</i>

14:10.678 --> 14:12.236
<i>Why don't you
suck a butt?</i>

14:13.147 --> 14:14.239
This is great.

14:14.515 --> 14:16.881
<i>Let's just pick on the nice guy
for bringing a little levity.</i>

14:17.318 --> 14:21.049
Maybe we should all just
stop talking for a while.

14:21.822 --> 14:22.982
Sure.

14:29.763 --> 14:33.859
<i>Okay, I was just joking.
I'm joking.</i>

14:58.925 --> 15:00.222
<i>Hey, Dwight,
are you there yet?</i>

15:00.293 --> 15:01.282
Almost.

15:04.631 --> 15:06.258
<i>Hey, look, man, I'm just
glad you're dating again.</i>

15:06.332 --> 15:07.663
<i>I'm just glad
you're glad.</i>

15:08.067 --> 15:11.798
You know what I meant. You
know, after all your troubles...

15:11.871 --> 15:13.532
I know what you meant.

15:14.807 --> 15:17.298
<i>So, how's that
been going for you?</i>

15:17.377 --> 15:18.435
Good.

15:18.511 --> 15:20.342
Ninety days tomorrow.

15:20.747 --> 15:22.578
Wow, 90 days!

15:22.682 --> 15:24.206
It seems like just
yesterday since we...

15:24.284 --> 15:25.945
<i>Not to me,
it doesn't.</i>

15:36.229 --> 15:38.697
<i>You wouldn't happen to have a
broken window up there, would you?</i>

15:38.765 --> 15:40.027
Yeah.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.657
Facing this direction?

15:42.902 --> 15:44.096
Mmm-hmm.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.395
Big enough to fit a person through it?

15:46.839 --> 15:48.329
I suppose.

15:49.374 --> 15:50.466
Please stop sweeping.

15:50.676 --> 15:53.008
<i>I'm declaring this
a crime scene.</i>

15:53.779 --> 15:55.246
Car 602.

15:56.181 --> 15:57.512
What the hell is that?

15:57.916 --> 15:58.905
Look out!

16:03.789 --> 16:04.949
You might want to
secure that better.

16:05.023 --> 16:06.149
Okay, okay!

16:06.592 --> 16:09.117
<i>In her story,
innocent people always die.</i>

16:10.562 --> 16:12.553
<i>Poor souls just
trying to help out,</i>

16:12.631 --> 16:15.031
<i>who didn't realize what
they were dealing with.</i>

16:16.034 --> 16:19.026
<i>He doesn't take kindly to
those who stand in his way.</i>

16:21.673 --> 16:23.265
Hey, old man.

16:23.408 --> 16:26.138
<i>It doesn't say inspection
mode here. Circuits look fine.</i>

16:26.378 --> 16:28.107
<i>Okay.
Try flipping elevator six.</i>

16:28.180 --> 16:31.013
<i>I'll tell the people in the
car. You count to 20, then do it.</i>

16:31.083 --> 16:32.243
Cool.

16:33.852 --> 16:38.949
<i>"Inspected and certified
August 12 by G. Carson. "</i>

16:40.025 --> 16:42.858
<i>Hey, what do you say we go visit
G. Carson when we're out of here?</i>

16:42.928 --> 16:45.192
Tell him what we think
of his inspecting prowess.

16:45.931 --> 16:48.331
<i>People, we're gonna flip off
the lights for one sec</i>

16:48.400 --> 16:49.731
<i>to see if there's
a short in the breaker.</i>

16:49.801 --> 16:51.098
<i>You're gonna
cut off the power?</i>

16:51.203 --> 16:52.693
Does that mean
we could drop?

16:52.871 --> 16:54.361
<i>You'll be fine. I just
didn't want you to...</i>

16:55.340 --> 16:56.329
<i>What's happening?
Come on!</i>

16:56.408 --> 16:58.638
Nothing.
Nothing. Just relax.

17:01.012 --> 17:02.036
Come on.

17:02.113 --> 17:03.375
Get off me!

17:04.482 --> 17:06.074
Get off me!

17:07.018 --> 17:08.246
Sorry.

17:13.624 --> 17:15.454
<i>What's wrong
with you, man?</i>

17:21.665 --> 17:23.827
When I was younger, my
brother locked me in a trunk

17:23.901 --> 17:25.232
for six hours.

17:25.636 --> 17:27.729
I have trouble
with tight spaces.

17:28.204 --> 17:29.934
Oh, great.

17:44.588 --> 17:45.646
Come on.

18:00.271 --> 18:01.431
Can we get out
through that?

18:01.505 --> 18:03.564
What are you gonna do?
Shimmy up the cables?

18:04.842 --> 18:06.366
<i>You'll be a lot safer
in here.</i>

18:07.345 --> 18:09.609
Anybody know where the
bathroom is in this thing?

18:10.513 --> 18:11.912
Did it work?

18:12.048 --> 18:13.481
<i>Nope, they're still stuck.</i>

18:14.384 --> 18:16.784
Let me go check the
mains in the basement.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.555
All right, thanks a lot. Wow.

18:26.463 --> 18:27.657
<i>What's going on?</i>

18:28.398 --> 18:29.695
You know that
window on 35?

18:29.766 --> 18:30.824
Yeah.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.130
Looks like somebody might
have jumped through it.

18:35.238 --> 18:36.432
Today?

18:36.573 --> 18:37.801
Yeah.
This morning.

18:40.710 --> 18:42.405
<i>Thanks for
bearing with us, people.</i>

18:42.479 --> 18:45.004
<i>We should get you back
on line in a few minutes.</i>

18:45.148 --> 18:46.410
<i>It's been minutes.</i>

18:46.516 --> 18:48.313
How long is it
going to take?

18:54.557 --> 18:57.458
<i>When we get out of here,
you're gonna need a good rest.</i>

18:58.762 --> 19:00.093
<i>"Mattress Mania"?</i>

19:00.497 --> 19:04.763
<i>That's us. Everybody's had their
mattress too long. Am I right?</i>

19:05.068 --> 19:09.061
<i>You didn't follow that advice
about flipping it every few months</i>

19:09.506 --> 19:11.872
<i>and now you've
worn a groove into it,</i>

19:11.941 --> 19:14.239
<i>and you think,
"Well, I'm used to it.</i>

19:14.310 --> 19:16.676
<i>"So, hey. But I do
miss the way it felt</i>

19:16.746 --> 19:18.611
<i>"when it came
fresh out of that bag. "</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:21.712
<i>Look at those shoes, they've
been through the mill.</i>

19:21.917 --> 19:26.251
<i>They're saying, "Someone deserves
a better place to lie down. "</i>

19:26.555 --> 19:28.182
Are you
insulting my shoes?

19:28.457 --> 19:32.416
The point is, a new mattress will
cost a lot less than you think.

19:32.861 --> 19:35.227
<i>You don't have to be
as well-off as this one.</i>

19:35.531 --> 19:37.465
<i>I'm not that well-off.</i>

19:38.734 --> 19:41.225
What makes me good
at selling mattresses

19:41.303 --> 19:43.771
<i>is I can look
at a person's clothes</i>

19:44.907 --> 19:48.308
and know exactly how much
they can afford to spend.

19:48.777 --> 19:51.268
<i>And you, lady,
you're no Super Sleeper.</i>

19:52.514 --> 19:58.384
Oh, my God. They keep playing
this song over and over and over.

19:59.087 --> 20:01.715
<i>Can't they just
turn the music off?</i>

20:04.660 --> 20:07.128
Did you just
touch my ass?

20:07.296 --> 20:10.129
What?
You wish, sweetheart.

20:10.232 --> 20:14.100
<i>I don't know who you think you
are, but keep your hands off me.</i>

20:15.471 --> 20:16.802
Whatever.

20:19.608 --> 20:20.700
Oh!

20:23.445 --> 20:25.845
They must be working
on the lights again.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.275
Hey, Dwight.

20:29.551 --> 20:30.575
<i>Dwight.</i>

20:30.652 --> 20:32.141
<i>I'm here.
I'm heading into the pit.</i>

20:32.353 --> 20:34.821
They just lost power in
number six again. Is that you?

20:34.989 --> 20:36.718
<i>No, you can't do that
from here, D.L.</i>

20:37.658 --> 20:39.649
<i>Huh.
That's strange.</i>

20:40.328 --> 20:41.920
<i>I'm looking at
elevator six right now.</i>

20:41.996 --> 20:43.554
<i>I can't see
anything wrong with it.</i>

20:44.065 --> 20:46.966
<i>The lights keep shorting out.
The passengers are getting scared.</i>

20:47.068 --> 20:48.501
See if this helps.

20:51.105 --> 20:52.436
Come on, come on.

20:52.874 --> 20:54.034
Oh, God.

20:54.108 --> 20:55.200
Come on, come on.

20:55.276 --> 20:56.265
Anything?

20:57.545 --> 20:58.705
No. No change.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.740
The only other thing
I can think to do

21:00.815 --> 21:02.976
would be going back up
to the roof, climbing down

21:03.050 --> 21:04.745
<i>and resetting
the car manually.</i>

21:05.253 --> 21:07.881
Yeah, yeah. Good. Do that, do
that. Call me when you get there.

21:08.089 --> 21:09.249
All right.

21:27.241 --> 21:28.333
Hey.

21:44.124 --> 21:45.250
What?

22:01.041 --> 22:02.372
All right.

22:06.279 --> 22:07.644
Get out of here.

22:09.082 --> 22:12.415
Off you go. Off you go. There you go.

22:23.763 --> 22:24.889
Oh!

22:31.004 --> 22:32.596
Shit!

22:32.672 --> 22:34.333
<i>"Inspected by G. Carson. "</i>

22:36.676 --> 22:37.870
What was that?

22:37.944 --> 22:39.070
What?

22:40.313 --> 22:41.541
I thought I heard...

22:43.516 --> 22:44.574
Ah!

22:45.185 --> 22:46.516
Shit.

22:55.427 --> 22:56.553
Are you all right?

22:56.629 --> 22:57.721
<i>I'm just...</i>

22:58.163 --> 23:01.155
<i>I think someone pulled
my blouse. I'm... I'm...</i>

23:01.367 --> 23:03.335
<i>You're bleeding.
Here. Here. Stand up.</i>

23:03.469 --> 23:05.266
Let me help you.

23:10.609 --> 23:12.839
I think I got cut.

23:14.780 --> 23:16.611
<i>What's going on
in there?</i>

23:16.749 --> 23:18.614
<i>I don't know.
They're just scared.</i>

23:19.652 --> 23:20.983
I think
that lady got hurt.

23:22.054 --> 23:23.043
Did she?

23:23.422 --> 23:24.548
Yeah, see that?

23:26.358 --> 23:27.689
What in the world?

23:27.793 --> 23:29.454
Oh, my God.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.831
<i>What's he saying?</i>

23:36.535 --> 23:38.196
<i>I can't tell
what he's saying.</i>

23:38.737 --> 23:40.432
<i>I can't tell what
you're trying to say.</i>

23:42.908 --> 23:45.570
Turn off the...
Turn off the music!

23:46.645 --> 23:48.476
<i>Maybe they don't
like the music.</i>

23:48.547 --> 23:50.412
<i>The music's still on?
Yeah.</i>

23:50.482 --> 23:52.677
<i>Turn it off. It's
probably driving them nuts.</i>

23:52.885 --> 23:54.648
Okay. How?

23:54.820 --> 23:57.448
<i>There's a kill switch
right behind the...</i>

23:57.523 --> 23:58.956
Right under the key box.

24:06.798 --> 24:08.129
Thank you!

24:08.766 --> 24:10.427
<i>What happened to her?</i>

24:11.202 --> 24:14.535
It feels like
something bit me.

24:14.605 --> 24:16.766
Wait, wait. Does anybody
have anything sharp on them

24:16.841 --> 24:17.967
that might have cut her,

24:18.042 --> 24:19.907
she might have cut herself on? No.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.511
Why you got
blood on you, man?

24:28.152 --> 24:29.244
She fell into me.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.344
So you cut her?

24:30.421 --> 24:32.651
What? No. No, something
must have happened to her

24:32.724 --> 24:34.214
and then she fell into me.

24:34.459 --> 24:35.721
She probably
did it to herself!

24:35.793 --> 24:37.192
Come on!
Bit her own back?

24:38.029 --> 24:39.155
You think this is a bite?

24:39.230 --> 24:40.288
No, nobody got bit.

24:40.364 --> 24:41.956
What else could
have done that?

24:42.100 --> 24:43.294
<i>I'll tell you.
I don't know.</i>

24:43.367 --> 24:44.800
A serrated blade
could have.

24:44.869 --> 24:46.461
<i>You wouldn't happen
to have a knife with</i>

24:46.537 --> 24:48.061
a serrated blade
on you, would you?

24:48.139 --> 24:49.265
No.

24:49.340 --> 24:51.774
Okay. You mind if we
search your pockets?

24:52.877 --> 24:54.504
Yes, I do mind.
You mind if we search yours?

24:54.579 --> 24:55.739
Go right ahead.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.279
Maybe she has
a serrated blade on her!

24:57.448 --> 25:00.008
Are you seriously suggesting
that I would do this to myself?

25:00.084 --> 25:01.108
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:01.219 --> 25:03.380
Give me another reason
to kick your ass.

25:03.488 --> 25:05.513
Please, bro,
take it easy, okay?

25:05.757 --> 25:06.815
Bro?

25:08.860 --> 25:10.225
<i>I'm not your bro.</i>

25:12.296 --> 25:14.456
Can you turn
towards the camera

25:14.531 --> 25:16.624
and show us what
happened to you, please?

25:20.804 --> 25:22.567
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

25:27.144 --> 25:28.702
Okay, we gotta
call the police.

25:43.426 --> 25:46.259
<i>We have a possible 240
at 333 Locust Street.</i>

25:48.298 --> 25:50.630
<i>333 Locust? That's
gotta be right around...</i>

25:53.069 --> 25:54.229
...here.

25:55.105 --> 25:56.265
Strange.

25:56.373 --> 26:00.002
602 responding. Happen to be
right outside. Put me on it.

26:00.076 --> 26:01.168
<i>Copy that, 602.</i>

26:01.244 --> 26:02.575
<i>That's convenient.</i>

26:02.813 --> 26:05.543
<i>I don't make the calls,
they just come for me.</i>

26:05.615 --> 26:06.843
Go.

26:09.419 --> 26:11.046
Markowitz!

26:13.490 --> 26:14.821
<i>Hey, how's
your girlfriend?</i>

26:14.891 --> 26:16.153
Shut up.

26:22.732 --> 26:23.891
What are you doing?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.161
I thought I saw something.

26:27.102 --> 26:28.865
What do you mean?
Like what?

26:29.738 --> 26:31.069
Something.

26:37.279 --> 26:39.008
Okay.
You see it?

26:39.648 --> 26:41.309
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Look, that's just...</i>

26:42.084 --> 26:43.483
<i>That's just
grain in the image.</i>

26:43.552 --> 26:44.917
<i>That's, you know...
It's a mistake.</i>

26:44.987 --> 26:47.285
<i>It's like when people see
Jesus in a pancake or something.</i>

26:47.356 --> 26:49.119
No. No. No.

26:54.363 --> 26:58.094
<i>Ramirez. Ramirez, you're
freaking me out. Come on.</i>

26:59.368 --> 27:02.963
Hey, hey.
Hey, listen to me.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.564
We need to convey calm. These
people are relying on us, okay?

27:06.642 --> 27:08.542
So stop this shit
right now.

27:09.078 --> 27:10.375
Come on.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.449
Come on!

27:31.367 --> 27:32.925
<i>I don't even know
why we're trying this.</i>

27:33.569 --> 27:35.195
<i>We're in the express shaft.</i>

27:35.270 --> 27:38.501
<i>There's not gonna be another
opening till the 23rd floor.</i>

27:38.573 --> 27:40.063
<i>Maybe we're close.</i>

27:40.141 --> 27:41.267
Could this elevator fall?

27:41.342 --> 27:42.400
I doubt it.

27:42.510 --> 27:46.344
Because we gotta be 20 floors
up, just dangling over nothing.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.912
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

27:50.885 --> 27:52.045
One more time.

27:53.521 --> 27:55.352
On three. One...

27:55.423 --> 27:56.447
Oh, no, no, no.

27:56.524 --> 27:57.855
Stay away from me, man.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.917
I can help. I want to
get out of here, too.

27:59.994 --> 28:04.124
<i>Why don't you sit your creepy
ass down in the corner over there?</i>

28:04.532 --> 28:05.863
We can all
keep an eye on you.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.237
Are you ready? On three.

28:13.341 --> 28:14.433
One, two...

28:14.609 --> 28:15.598
Three.

28:19.213 --> 28:20.703
<i>I'm just over here.</i>

28:23.818 --> 28:25.649
And why do you think
this might be an assault?

28:25.753 --> 28:28.313
She seemed to be having words
with one of the other passengers

28:28.389 --> 28:29.583
just before it happened,

28:29.657 --> 28:31.181
<i>and now it looks like they're
all keeping an eye on him.</i>

28:31.259 --> 28:33.159
Which guy?
That guy, right there.

28:33.328 --> 28:34.386
Do we have communication?

28:34.595 --> 28:36.756
Yeah, we have
an open line here.

28:36.898 --> 28:39.093
<i>You can talk,
but we can't hear.</i>

28:40.368 --> 28:44.327
Hello, everyone. This is
Detective Bowden, Philadelphia P.D.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.938
<i>We're working hard to get you out
of there. Shouldn't be much longer.</i>

28:47.007 --> 28:48.975
Please just remain calm.

28:49.943 --> 28:51.410
How soon till we get in?

28:51.478 --> 28:52.911
<i>Engineer's
working on it now.</i>

28:52.980 --> 28:54.880
Usually, we get these
things going pretty quick.

28:55.115 --> 28:57.015
This engineer work for you
guys or the elevator company?

28:57.084 --> 28:58.108
Works for us.

28:58.218 --> 28:59.480
Okay.
Call the elevator company

28:59.553 --> 29:01.077
and have them
send someone, okay?

29:01.154 --> 29:02.917
And have the Fire Department
send some guys.

29:02.990 --> 29:04.218
You got it.

29:05.025 --> 29:06.720
At least one of your staff is aboard.

29:06.860 --> 29:09.021
<i>Oh, yeah, the guard there,
he's a temp, actually.</i>

29:09.129 --> 29:11.563
<i>Ben something. I don't know.
He started yesterday.</i>

29:11.631 --> 29:15.089
Okay. Call the temp agency and
get all the info they have on him.

29:15.969 --> 29:17.163
And the others?

29:17.237 --> 29:18.864
<i>We don't have names
for the others.</i>

29:19.072 --> 29:20.300
What?
He should see the face.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.732
No.
What face?

29:21.842 --> 29:23.469
No. Nothing.
I saw a face.

29:23.810 --> 29:25.505
<i>Look, there's no face.
Tell him about the face.</i>

29:25.579 --> 29:29.106
No. Look, Ramirez is kind of
religious. Just ignore him. Trust me.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.717
<i>I'd like to get a sense
of who you all are.</i>

29:31.852 --> 29:33.319
<i>Stop it right now,
comprende?</i>

29:33.787 --> 29:35.277
<i>One at a time,
I'd like you to hold up</i>

29:35.355 --> 29:36.822
<i>your driver's license
to the camera</i>

29:36.890 --> 29:38.551
<i>so I know who
I'm talking to.</i>

29:38.625 --> 29:40.388
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

29:40.460 --> 29:41.518
Thank you.

29:41.928 --> 29:42.986
Yeah.

29:48.201 --> 29:50.192
Try and get it
closer to the camera.

29:51.405 --> 29:53.134
The letters are too small.

29:54.141 --> 29:55.698
Is there a sharpness
setting on this thing?

29:55.908 --> 29:58.308
<i>No, that's as good as
it gets, right there.</i>

29:58.511 --> 30:01.002
<i>You can put your ID's away.
Thanks.</i>

30:01.881 --> 30:03.940
Do any of you
have a pen on you?

30:06.318 --> 30:07.376
No one?

30:14.527 --> 30:15.755
Here you go.

30:17.663 --> 30:19.756
<i>I want you to account for
everyone on the visitors' log.</i>

30:19.832 --> 30:20.890
Find out which
of these people

30:20.966 --> 30:22.092
<i>didn't show up
for their appointment.</i>

30:22.168 --> 30:23.499
You got it.

30:26.572 --> 30:27.800
You sure?

30:29.141 --> 30:30.301
Okay.

30:39.685 --> 30:41.516
Keep him away from me.

30:56.569 --> 30:58.298
Must be working
on the power again.

30:59.138 --> 31:01.538
The geniuses have done
a bang-up job so far.

31:36.574 --> 31:37.939
Any other exits?

31:38.076 --> 31:39.475
<i>No, sir,
that's everything.</i>

31:39.811 --> 31:41.779
Hey. I got some info on your guard.

31:41.846 --> 31:42.835
What have you got?

31:42.914 --> 31:44.745
Check this out.
We got...

31:44.883 --> 31:46.714
Hey. Something else is happening.

32:00.198 --> 32:01.688
Is he dead?

32:09.774 --> 32:13.266
602, we have a possible 187.
I need backup.

32:13.411 --> 32:15.242
How do you
rewind this thing?

32:16.680 --> 32:18.773
<i>Rewind, fast forward
and that's frame-to-frame.</i>

32:18.882 --> 32:20.076
Frame-to-frame.

32:20.484 --> 32:21.781
Everyone,
just keep breathing.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.753
<i>We're gonna get you through
this. Just take it easy, okay?</i>

32:25.222 --> 32:27.747
So today,
someone committed suicide,

32:27.824 --> 32:30.315
a woman got hurt,
now a man is dead.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.189
Yeah, what are you trying to say?

32:33.430 --> 32:35.728
Look, how many times
have you seen a child fall

32:35.899 --> 32:38.527
and barely miss the edge of
the table with their head?

32:39.169 --> 32:40.534
Why is it so rare
that they hit it?

32:40.637 --> 32:42.127
Get to your point.

32:45.309 --> 32:46.298
Look.

32:51.481 --> 32:54.211
<i>What are you doing?
You're embarrassing yourself.</i>

32:54.651 --> 32:57.279
<i>When he's near,
everything goes wrong.</i>

32:57.688 --> 33:01.681
Toast falls jelly-side down,
children hit tables

33:02.059 --> 33:03.185
and people get hurt.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.194
Hey. The police do not want to
hear this stuff, Ramirez. Okay?

33:05.262 --> 33:06.354
So just stop. Now.

33:06.430 --> 33:08.489
Sometimes he
takes human form

33:08.699 --> 33:12.567
and torments the damned on
Earth before stealing them away.

33:13.203 --> 33:15.364
Where I come from,
we call it

33:16.173 --> 33:17.367
<i>The Devil's Meeting.</i>

33:17.841 --> 33:18.967
Is this guy for real?

33:19.076 --> 33:21.601
<i>Look, I'm sorry. Ramirez.</i>

33:23.413 --> 33:25.779
You must consider
that one of those people

33:27.550 --> 33:29.347
might be the Devil.
All right. Come on.

33:29.418 --> 33:31.249
I need you to stop
telling campfire stories

33:31.320 --> 33:32.981
and get your head
in the game.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.454
<i>It's okay.
It's all right.</i>

33:34.523 --> 33:36.081
Markowitz, look at this guy right here.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.817
Yeah.

33:38.194 --> 33:41.960
Lights go down,
they come back up,

33:42.498 --> 33:44.261
<i>he's closer,
but he's moving away.</i>

33:44.700 --> 33:46.167
What were you
saying about the guard?

33:46.235 --> 33:48.533
<i>All right. Yeah.
He's a real piece of work.</i>

33:50.039 --> 33:52.530
Assault, assault,
assault.

33:52.942 --> 33:55.877
<i>Beat a guy into a coma with
a baseball bat. That's great.</i>

33:55.978 --> 33:58.344
These the kind of guys
you hire for security?

33:58.514 --> 34:00.345
<i>Like I said,
he's just a temp.</i>

34:00.683 --> 34:01.843
Some temp.

34:04.186 --> 34:06.746
Could that mirror break
from him hitting it?

34:11.927 --> 34:13.018
Then how did...

34:13.094 --> 34:14.995
<i>What's that cop
doing out there?</i>

34:18.534 --> 34:21.230
<i>He's probably
trying to figure out</i>

34:21.370 --> 34:24.065
which one of us
is the murderer.

34:49.464 --> 34:52.831
<i>In the story, men would always
try to fight him with force,</i>

34:53.168 --> 34:55.728
<i>but some battles
can't be fought with weapons.</i>

34:56.004 --> 34:57.266
Will you all
please clear a space

34:57.339 --> 34:58.533
between
the camera and the body

34:58.606 --> 34:59.595
so I can see him?

35:00.642 --> 35:03.611
<i>Don't touch the body.
This is a crime scene now.</i>

35:03.745 --> 35:04.939
<i>Though I know
you're stuck in there,</i>

35:05.013 --> 35:06.776
I expect you to
do as little damage to it

35:06.848 --> 35:08.577
as humanly possible,
got it?

35:10.018 --> 35:11.280
Any luck with
the elevator company?

35:11.419 --> 35:12.681
<i>They're out of business.</i>

35:14.155 --> 35:15.816
I guess that figures.

35:17.325 --> 35:19.486
A shard of glass sliced
up and into the jugular.

35:19.594 --> 35:21.255
This is definitely
not an accident.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.998
Who chooses a contained room with
three witnesses for a killing?

35:29.337 --> 35:31.897
<i>Unless they're so worked up,
they can't control themselves.</i>

35:32.540 --> 35:35.634
<i>These people are shook up,
but they don't look murderous.</i>

35:37.345 --> 35:38.812
<i>I'm missing something here.</i>

35:46.287 --> 35:48.311
I need a volunteer
to help me out.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.052
<i>There's a piece of paper
hanging out of his pocket.</i>

35:56.163 --> 35:59.257
<i>Very carefully, I want you to take
it out and hold it up to the camera.</i>

36:16.917 --> 36:19.886
<i>"Vince. "
It looks like "McCormick. "</i>

36:20.053 --> 36:22.317
The return address is for
the Better Business Bureau.

36:22.456 --> 36:24.048
They have an office
on 35.

36:24.858 --> 36:26.450
You got a freight elevator? Yeah.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.267
<i>I've never seen
a person die.</i>

36:43.210 --> 36:44.939
Neither have I.

36:46.013 --> 36:47.640
<i>It's pretty awful, huh?</i>

36:49.917 --> 36:51.407
So, what, you have?

36:54.087 --> 36:56.555
Yeah, I spent some time
in Afghanistan.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.325
<i>You see some things
you wish you hadn't.</i>

37:03.596 --> 37:05.564
<i>Wait, so you've been
trained to kill people?</i>

37:07.433 --> 37:08.764
Ooh-rah.

37:16.375 --> 37:17.967
<i>How's your jumper
shaping up?</i>

37:18.044 --> 37:19.136
Hey.

37:20.046 --> 37:23.345
Can you take a look at this suicide
note? Most of it makes sense,

37:23.416 --> 37:27.182
<i>but then it ends with, "I can hear
the Devil's footsteps draw near. "</i>

37:29.355 --> 37:32.756
Usually, suicide notes are
either all crazy or all rational,

37:32.825 --> 37:34.315
<i>but this one's both.</i>

37:34.727 --> 37:36.422
<i>It's strange, isn't it?</i>

37:38.364 --> 37:39.831
Yeah, it is.

37:44.604 --> 37:46.697
This one?
Elevator key.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.003
<i>Key's not catching.</i>

37:51.110 --> 37:52.737
All right.
Try the Halligan.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.542
<i>Something's jamming it.</i>

37:59.085 --> 38:00.177
Look, if I can...

38:00.253 --> 38:03.450
<i>If I can get up there, I can maybe
figure out what's wrong with this thing.</i>

38:07.093 --> 38:10.892
<i>I'm a mechanic. I'm pretty
good with this sort of thing.</i>

38:18.737 --> 38:22.104
<i>He's trying to escape.
He's trying to escape.</i>

38:22.173 --> 38:23.606
<i>He's trying to escape!</i>

38:23.675 --> 38:25.370
<i>He's trying to escape!
Stop! Stop!</i>

38:25.477 --> 38:27.638
Stop it!
Stop! What are you doing?

38:31.449 --> 38:32.746
What the hell are you doing?

38:32.817 --> 38:35.684
<i>We're all gonna stay right
here until this thing is over.</i>

38:35.787 --> 38:37.914
You knew what I was doing!
I told you what I was doing!

38:38.023 --> 38:39.320
<i>I don't know you!</i>

38:43.228 --> 38:45.321
<i>It's not our policy to
discuss cases under review.</i>

38:45.397 --> 38:48.423
It kind of damages the reputations
of our member businesses.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.161
Look, someone just killed him
on his way here.

38:50.235 --> 38:53.295
I need to know who knew he was
coming here and who wanted him dead.

38:54.673 --> 38:57.506
The line would
stretch around the block.

38:58.076 --> 38:59.839
The guy was a real scumbag.

39:00.078 --> 39:02.706
Three years ago, he started
one of those Ponzi schemes

39:02.847 --> 39:05.247
and when it collapsed, a lot
of people lost their asses.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.109
One guy even
killed himself over it.

39:07.285 --> 39:09.014
Do you have a list of people
that got burned by him?

39:09.087 --> 39:11.078
<i>Yeah, the ones that filed.
I'm gonna need it.</i>

39:11.356 --> 39:14.348
So, what do you say we get to know
each other a little bit better?

39:15.093 --> 39:18.688
Here. Come on.
Frisk me. Search me.

39:18.763 --> 39:21.925
<i>See that I'm not carrying
anything suspicious.</i>

39:23.634 --> 39:24.726
Come on!

39:35.946 --> 39:37.436
<i>You're next.</i>

39:43.721 --> 39:45.621
<i>There's a good chance one
of our people didn't sign in.</i>

39:45.756 --> 39:46.882
<i>How's that?</i>

39:46.957 --> 39:48.322
<i>'Cause that person
might be on this list.</i>

39:48.392 --> 39:49.416
<i>What's this?</i>

39:49.493 --> 39:51.427
Our victim lost a lot
of people a lot of money.

39:51.495 --> 39:53.019
These are the ones
that filed complaints.

39:53.130 --> 39:55.894
<i>The killer's probably smart
enough not to be on both lists.</i>

39:56.000 --> 39:57.729
<i>Look for the one
that didn't sign in.</i>

39:58.235 --> 39:59.668
Did you just want video
of the guy who died,

39:59.737 --> 40:01.102
or also the girl
that got hurt?

40:01.205 --> 40:02.729
All of it since they got in the car.

40:02.806 --> 40:03.830
Okay.

40:03.907 --> 40:05.067
Detective.

40:07.444 --> 40:08.775
You see?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.177
<i>That's what
you're talking about?</i>

40:12.883 --> 40:14.817
Everybody believes
in him a little bit,

40:14.885 --> 40:17.353
<i>even guys like you
who pretend they don't.</i>

40:32.769 --> 40:34.100
<i>What's this?</i>

40:37.240 --> 40:39.731
An apology note left at
the site of a hit-and-run.

40:41.177 --> 40:44.340
My wife and son were killed down
on Bethlehem Pike five years ago,

40:46.582 --> 40:51.178
<i>but that's okay, because
whoever did it is sorry.</i>

40:52.655 --> 40:54.520
You can tell
by the heartfelt apology

40:54.590 --> 40:56.387
on the back of
a car wash coupon.

40:56.592 --> 40:59.493
<i>So, no, I don't believe in
the Devil. We don't need him.</i>

40:59.929 --> 41:02.329
People are bad enough
by themselves.

41:03.966 --> 41:05.297
Stop the tape.

41:06.169 --> 41:07.363
Back it up.

41:07.804 --> 41:09.203
Faster, faster.

41:09.806 --> 41:11.273
There. Now, play it.

41:12.875 --> 41:14.843
She was acting
like he grabbed her.

41:18.181 --> 41:20.115
What is she up to?

41:22.719 --> 41:25.552
Folks, do me a favor, keep
your hands off each other.

41:25.621 --> 41:28.522
<i>Leave the police work to me.
I'll be in there any moment.</i>

41:29.525 --> 41:30.958
<i>Won't I?</i>

41:52.681 --> 41:53.978
Stop it.

41:56.084 --> 41:58.609
<i>I don't like him touching me.
He's touching me.</i>

41:58.754 --> 41:59.948
<i>I don't like it!</i>

42:00.021 --> 42:01.147
Stop pushing him onto me.

42:01.490 --> 42:02.684
Stand back.

42:02.791 --> 42:03.985
<i>Hell, no.
I know you're not doing</i>

42:04.059 --> 42:05.356
<i>what it looks
like you're doing!</i>

42:05.427 --> 42:07.054
<i>Spray that in here, you're
gonna blind all of us.</i>

42:07.162 --> 42:08.459
<i>I'll do it.
Seriously, put it down.</i>

42:08.530 --> 42:09.588
Lady...

42:16.171 --> 42:20.608
Dwight, where are you? You gotta
stop disappearing, seriously.

42:21.710 --> 42:22.802
<i>Dwight.</i>

42:22.944 --> 42:24.070
Hang on a sec.

42:24.546 --> 42:27.674
<i>Dwight, you gotta get us in that
car right now. Where are you?</i>

42:29.384 --> 42:31.079
<i>I can't.</i>

42:31.920 --> 42:33.649
<i>Dwight, I need you to stay on walkie!</i>

42:33.722 --> 42:35.019
Man...

42:41.329 --> 42:43.524
Can you see this?
Huh? You see this?

42:47.302 --> 42:51.203
<i>"Use by October 21, 1987."</i>

42:51.272 --> 42:52.671
She was scared. Relax.

42:52.973 --> 42:54.702
She tried to
pepper spray me, man!

43:03.517 --> 43:05.075
<i>Dwight, where are you?</i>

43:05.452 --> 43:07.010
<i>We're being saved.</i>

43:08.122 --> 43:09.783
Dwight, where are you?

43:12.259 --> 43:13.920
Come on, pick up.
Pick up!

43:14.028 --> 43:15.290
They hear something.

43:15.930 --> 43:18.330
They hear your guy
moving in the shaft.

43:18.699 --> 43:20.530
<i>Then how come
he's not answering?</i>

43:20.835 --> 43:23.827
<i>Dwight? Dwight, this is serious.
You need to pick up, Dwight.</i>

43:25.339 --> 43:26.431
Thank you!

43:26.807 --> 43:29.139
<i>Pick up, Dwight. Pick up.</i>

43:34.982 --> 43:36.108
Oh, no.

43:37.151 --> 43:40.951
No, no. Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, no. Hey!

43:41.188 --> 43:42.985
Hey! You all right?

43:46.861 --> 43:48.590
Hey!
Come on.

43:48.829 --> 43:51.730
Come on! Hey!

44:15.221 --> 44:17.121
Dwight, where the hell
are you, man? Come on!

44:17.357 --> 44:19.120
What floor did Dwight
enter the shaft from?

44:19.259 --> 44:21.022
He entered from the roof.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.161
What are they looking at?

44:25.498 --> 44:27.830
Dwight. Dwight, pick up.

44:52.959 --> 44:56.725
<i>Looks like he fell. He's impaled
right on top of the elevator.</i>

44:56.796 --> 44:58.627
<i>Hurt real bad.
Possibly dead.</i>

45:04.203 --> 45:06.171
Hey, Bowden, I think the
people in the elevator

45:06.239 --> 45:08.139
can hear our radios.

45:11.077 --> 45:12.566
<i>Yeah, that's confirmed.</i>

45:13.512 --> 45:15.070
<i>Can you switch
to channel eight?</i>

45:15.480 --> 45:17.539
<i>The car's stuck on 21.</i>

45:17.683 --> 45:19.708
Markowitz, tell the Fire
Department looks like they have to

45:19.785 --> 45:21.844
go through the wall on 21.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.146
<i>This is Lustig. You can't
just go through the wall.</i>

45:25.223 --> 45:26.212
<i>Sure we can.</i>

45:26.692 --> 45:28.523
<i>That's why you
have insurance.</i>

45:31.830 --> 45:34.025
Fire command,
go to eight, please.

45:38.470 --> 45:39.562
There she is.

45:39.638 --> 45:40.662
Sarah Caraway.

45:40.739 --> 45:42.900
We know the security temp
is Benjamin Larson

45:42.975 --> 45:43.999
and we know McCormick.

45:44.076 --> 45:45.941
What other names
are unaccounted for?

45:46.611 --> 45:50.945
<i>Jane something. Looks like
"Kowski. " The older woman.</i>

45:54.319 --> 45:55.980
Find me footage
of this guy.

45:56.555 --> 45:58.113
<i>This way, ma'am.</i>

45:58.957 --> 46:00.288
<i>Let's go.
All clear.</i>

46:04.796 --> 46:06.593
Okay, this time slow.

46:13.772 --> 46:15.103
You gotta be kidding me.

46:15.173 --> 46:16.435
<i>Did she just steal
that lady's wallet?</i>

46:16.608 --> 46:19.600
<i>So Vince was a scam artist,
this woman Jane's a thief,</i>

46:19.845 --> 46:23.177
Sarah there is a liar
and our guard is a thug.

46:23.547 --> 46:25.538
Quite the crew
we have here.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.847
<i>I still haven't
seen this guy here.</i>

46:32.890 --> 46:33.879
What was that?

46:34.425 --> 46:35.790
<i>It's okay.
Hard drive crash.</i>

46:35.893 --> 46:37.190
I got it.
Number 2.

46:40.364 --> 46:41.422
Here we go.

46:43.601 --> 46:45.626
Any other angle
on the lobby?

46:46.170 --> 46:47.865
Just the main entrance.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.132
There.

46:52.243 --> 46:54.108
Okay, rewind back.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.407
Faster.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.805
There he is. Stop it.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.688
<i>Where's that satchel?</i>

47:12.396 --> 47:15.559
<i>He doesn't... There's no
satchel in the elevator.</i>

47:16.901 --> 47:18.095
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

47:21.138 --> 47:22.469
Shit.

47:23.808 --> 47:25.036
Oh, no.

47:25.409 --> 47:26.740
<i>What's happening?</i>

47:29.013 --> 47:30.640
<i>I can't take this anymore!</i>

47:30.714 --> 47:32.614
<i>Don't come near me,
any of you!</i>

47:32.750 --> 47:34.683
Maybe, if I could
just check the wiring...

47:49.966 --> 47:51.866
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

48:02.112 --> 48:05.275
Please.
Please turn on the light.

48:07.050 --> 48:09.541
Turn on the lights!

48:23.800 --> 48:26.633
<i>That's it.
Shut down the building.</i>

48:27.137 --> 48:28.764
Bring everyone
down to the lobby.

48:28.905 --> 48:30.532
Nobody comes
in or out but us.

48:32.142 --> 48:33.905
Which guy do you think
is doing this?

48:33.977 --> 48:36.309
<i>There are three people in
there and they're all capable.</i>

48:36.679 --> 48:37.976
<i>Well, she's not doing it.</i>

48:38.348 --> 48:40.282
<i>I'm ruling nobody out.</i>

48:40.517 --> 48:42.451
Fire Department wants to know
if you have a shut-off valve

48:42.519 --> 48:44.247
before they get through
the wall, just in case.

48:44.486 --> 48:47.853
<i>Yeah, it's
in the basement.</i>

48:50.359 --> 48:51.690
<i>I'll go.</i>

48:56.298 --> 48:57.925
<i>They're bad people,
that's why they're here.</i>

48:58.000 --> 49:01.197
No, two of them are here because
they just got on the wrong elevator.

49:01.270 --> 49:03.329
Yeah, and I just happened
to have the wrong job

49:03.405 --> 49:05.532
and you just happened to
take the wrong call.

49:12.981 --> 49:14.972
He never
does this in secret.

49:16.919 --> 49:19.149
<i>There's a reason
we're the audience.</i>

49:25.861 --> 49:27.556
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

49:27.763 --> 49:29.230
<i>No one's getting in
this building right now.</i>

49:29.298 --> 49:30.663
<i>I know. I'm supposed to
meet somebody upstairs.</i>

49:30.732 --> 49:32.723
<i>You're gonna have to call them
and tell them you can't make it.</i>

49:32.801 --> 49:34.234
<i>Can you just tell me
what's happening?</i>

49:34.303 --> 49:36.271
<i>He always
kills the last victim</i>

49:36.338 --> 49:38.238
<i>in front of
the person they love most</i>

49:39.708 --> 49:41.573
<i>to make cynics of us all.</i>

49:41.777 --> 49:43.404
<i>No, no, no.
Don't touch her.</i>

49:43.478 --> 49:45.036
<i>I'm not gonna leave her
just hanging there.</i>

49:46.848 --> 49:48.406
Where you gonna put her?

49:48.550 --> 49:50.142
<i>I haven't
thought that far ahead.</i>

49:57.225 --> 49:58.886
Funny how all this
stuff starts happening

49:59.026 --> 50:00.687
right after you
start working here.

50:00.761 --> 50:02.251
<i>Seems to me,
you're the only one</i>

50:02.330 --> 50:03.763
who knew where
the cables are.

50:18.212 --> 50:19.770
What are you doing?

50:22.149 --> 50:24.049
Trying to
close her eyes.

50:26.854 --> 50:30.415
<i>That doesn't work, not until
they're dead for a few hours.</i>

50:37.531 --> 50:39.226
Okay, you enter the
building with a satchel.

50:39.300 --> 50:41.734
You see a sign-in desk you
wanna avoid. Where do you go?

50:43.771 --> 50:45.705
Restroom.
Yep.

50:57.985 --> 50:59.213
Got it.

51:12.632 --> 51:14.691
Could those be used
to rig an elevator?

51:15.602 --> 51:20.665
<i>I have no idea, but he doesn't
sign in and then he hides these?</i>

52:01.681 --> 52:03.581
What the hell is that?

52:04.651 --> 52:06.084
<i>I wish he'd stop.</i>

52:14.160 --> 52:16.320
<i>I don't even know your name.</i>

52:22.668 --> 52:24.067
<i>I'm Ben.</i>

52:24.970 --> 52:26.528
<i>I'm Sarah.</i>

52:29.375 --> 52:31.172
<i>I'm Tony.</i>

52:44.957 --> 52:46.982
<i>So where'd your
claustrophobia go?</i>

52:47.059 --> 52:48.117
Excuse me?

52:50.696 --> 52:54.689
<i>I've never seen claustrophobia
come and go like that.</i>

52:56.702 --> 52:58.693
You trying to say something?
Then say it. Yeah, yeah.

52:58.804 --> 53:00.203
<i>Okay, I'm saying
I didn't do this,</i>

53:00.272 --> 53:02.103
and I very much doubt that
she did, so that leaves you.

53:02.975 --> 53:05.500
<i>I'm saying I think this
claustrophobia thing...</i>

53:06.645 --> 53:08.374
<i>I think it's an act.</i>

53:09.114 --> 53:11.105
<i>Yeah, I'm saying
I think you're a liar.</i>

53:23.629 --> 53:24.857
Kill him, Ben!

53:27.398 --> 53:28.956
Kill him
before he kills us!

53:30.268 --> 53:31.326
Kill him!

53:35.106 --> 53:36.095
Stop it! Stop!

53:37.775 --> 53:40.209
Stop it! Get us out!
Get us out! Get us out!

53:42.146 --> 53:45.513
Back away from each other now! Get off!

53:46.617 --> 53:48.517
<i>We're gonna keep you safe
and here's how,</i>

53:48.586 --> 53:51.316
everyone get to a corner and
place your hands on the wall

53:51.389 --> 53:53.118
<i>so everyone can see that
you're not up to anything.</i>

53:53.624 --> 53:55.785
Go ahead. Do it!

53:58.896 --> 54:00.420
<i>You won't have to
keep this up long.</i>

54:00.498 --> 54:02.398
The building is
surrounded by police.

54:10.308 --> 54:14.210
<i>In a hypothetical conversation
that I'm not really having,</i>

54:15.179 --> 54:17.409
how would this
story of yours end?

54:18.816 --> 54:20.374
They all die.

54:22.620 --> 54:23.951
<i>That's it?</i>

54:25.456 --> 54:26.616
Yeah.

54:28.326 --> 54:30.157
This is not
your fault.

54:31.829 --> 54:34.320
They made the choices
that brought them here.

54:36.566 --> 54:38.534
<i>Hey. You're gonna love this.</i>

54:38.602 --> 54:39.899
What have you got?

54:39.970 --> 54:41.301
She has
a criminal record, too.

54:41.905 --> 54:44.430
Three counts of blackmailing
rich married men.

54:44.508 --> 54:45.770
Now where this
gets interesting,

54:45.842 --> 54:48.276
is couple of years ago, the
arrests stopped. Guess why.

54:48.345 --> 54:49.369
Tell me.

54:49.446 --> 54:51.107
Well, her name is
Sarah Caraway.

54:51.615 --> 54:52.843
<i>"Caraway" Caraway?</i>

54:52.916 --> 54:54.178
Yeah. She married into the family.

54:54.251 --> 54:55.411
So she shoplifted an heir.

54:55.485 --> 54:56.577
Yeah, something
like that, I guess.

54:56.653 --> 54:58.280
<i>What's she doing here?</i>

54:58.355 --> 54:59.617
According to
the sign-in sheet,

54:59.689 --> 55:03.125
she was gonna see a lawyer
on 42 named Wayne Kazan.

55:04.494 --> 55:06.928
Excuse me. Excuse me.

55:07.664 --> 55:10.861
Hey, listen up!
Quiet down! Quiet down!

55:12.168 --> 55:13.499
Hey, quiet!

55:14.538 --> 55:16.028
Philadelphia P. D!

55:17.107 --> 55:18.665
<i>I'm looking for
a Wayne Kazan.</i>

55:18.742 --> 55:20.266
Is there a Wayne Kazan
down here?

55:20.343 --> 55:22.004
Yeah.

55:22.078 --> 55:23.306
Excuse me.

55:23.613 --> 55:26.810
Heads up. Did you have a meeting
today with a Sarah Caraway?

55:27.817 --> 55:29.045
<i>I don't know.
Do you have a subpoena?</i>

55:29.119 --> 55:30.814
Come on,
you can tell me that much.

55:31.087 --> 55:32.645
I might have. Why?

55:32.822 --> 55:35.689
She was attacked. Who
has motive to hurt her?

55:35.926 --> 55:37.518
<i>Well, you know I can't
divulge personal information.</i>

55:37.594 --> 55:38.720
Come on, man.
Give me something.

55:38.795 --> 55:39.887
Give me something
to work with here.

55:39.963 --> 55:41.294
<i>I'm trying to save
your client's life.</i>

55:42.299 --> 55:43.766
Come here.

55:46.670 --> 55:48.534
<i>I guess I'd do what
you guys normally do</i>

55:48.604 --> 55:50.435
and start with
the person closest to her.

55:52.107 --> 55:53.472
Thanks.
And just so you know,

55:54.143 --> 55:56.373
my specialty is
forensic accounting.

55:58.681 --> 56:01.047
<i>Markowitz, get Mrs. Caraway's
husband on the phone.</i>

56:07.456 --> 56:08.980
Should be okay now.

56:17.299 --> 56:18.994
All right, get in there.

56:37.920 --> 56:40.787
<i>I might have found the
problem. It's a bad wire.</i>

56:40.856 --> 56:43.256
Looks like it could be
shorting out the circuits.

57:03.511 --> 57:04.500
Okay.

57:08.249 --> 57:10.649
Easy. Easy.

57:10.985 --> 57:12.179
<i>That's it.</i>

57:31.906 --> 57:33.237
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

57:33.574 --> 57:35.940
<i>Vasquez, we're gonna need
the large Target saw up here</i>

57:36.010 --> 57:36.999
as fast as you can bring it.

57:44.786 --> 57:46.219
Look, we need two
more on 21, okay, guys?

57:46.287 --> 57:48.152
Any luck getting
hold of the husband?

57:48.222 --> 57:49.211
No, not yet.

57:49.290 --> 57:51.724
<i>I called his office and his secretary
said he'd call me right back.</i>

57:56.230 --> 57:57.993
Back up! Heads up, heads up! Come on!

57:58.066 --> 57:59.226
Heads up! Back up!

57:59.300 --> 58:01.666
Move out of the way!
Get away! Back up!

58:01.736 --> 58:03.499
What happened?
Anybody see what happened?

58:03.571 --> 58:04.560
Medic!

58:04.639 --> 58:05.628
He came through the door.

58:05.907 --> 58:07.931
Breathe. Breathe.

58:08.408 --> 58:09.705
Lustig.

58:10.210 --> 58:12.610
Back away!
Back away! Move back!

58:12.679 --> 58:15.773
Get everybody back.
Back away!

58:33.867 --> 58:35.300
Put your hands
back on the wall.

58:35.435 --> 58:36.595
It hurts.

58:40.941 --> 58:43.307
Put your hands
back up on that wall.

58:46.847 --> 58:48.075
Or what?

58:51.618 --> 58:53.779
<i>Just leave her alone.
She's in pain.</i>

58:54.054 --> 58:56.284
<i>Don't you see
what she's doing?</i>

58:57.424 --> 58:59.085
<i>Chick's a twist.</i>

58:59.659 --> 59:00.887
What are you talking about?

59:00.961 --> 59:03.953
<i>Yeah, that's what we used to call
people like her in the Marines.</i>

59:04.865 --> 59:07.993
Suddenly out of the blue, everybody
would start fighting with each other.

59:08.101 --> 59:10.501
Tempers would flare, people
would start getting hurt.

59:10.570 --> 59:14.768
<i>But then we realized
it's just the new guy</i>

59:15.475 --> 59:17.568
telling everybody
what other people said,

59:17.644 --> 59:19.941
<i>stirring shit up
where there wasn't any.</i>

59:22.014 --> 59:26.041
Until one night when we beat the
living shit out of that twist.

59:28.053 --> 59:30.851
And then, just like that,

59:33.225 --> 59:35.193
everything would
go back to normal.

59:37.363 --> 59:39.194
Are you threatening me?

59:39.598 --> 59:42.158
I just want you to know
that I know.

59:43.969 --> 59:46.563
<i>Why don't you just shut up and
keep your hands on the wall?</i>

01:00:03.756 --> 01:00:05.724
<i>Sarah Caraway's husband
won't talk to us.</i>

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:06.815
<i>He lawyered up.</i>

01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:09.520
<i>Her lawyer told me
she's locating all his money.</i>

01:00:09.862 --> 01:00:12.023
<i>I bet she's about to leave
him and he might know it.</i>

01:00:12.364 --> 01:00:14.161
That would definitely
give him motive to kill her.

01:00:14.533 --> 01:00:15.659
<i>But if he's trying
to kill his wife,</i>

01:00:15.734 --> 01:00:17.395
<i>why are Jane Kowski
and Vince McCormick dead?</i>

01:00:17.503 --> 01:00:18.731
This is Matt with
Caraway Security.

01:00:19.138 --> 01:00:20.400
I need someone
from maintenance

01:00:20.472 --> 01:00:21.700
to come down and
shut the bay doors.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.939
<i>Sarah Caraway's husband doesn't
own Caraway Security, does he?</i>

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:30.378
Meet me in the office!

01:00:41.025 --> 01:00:42.287
<i>He's not done yet.</i>

01:00:42.393 --> 01:00:43.917
<i>It's the Kensington sniper
all over again.</i>

01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:45.694
<i>What's a Kensington sniper?</i>

01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:48.991
A few years ago, a guy shot four
strangers and then his own wife,

01:00:49.067 --> 01:00:51.001
trying to make a personal
killing look like a serial.

01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:53.299
<i>The guard works
for the woman's husband.</i>

01:00:53.371 --> 01:00:54.963
I think the two victims
were just a decoy.

01:00:55.039 --> 01:00:56.131
The guard is
gonna kill her.

01:00:56.274 --> 01:00:57.400
I need to be in that elevator right now!

01:00:57.475 --> 01:00:58.806
Move!
Right.

01:01:02.313 --> 01:01:03.837
<i>Please don't let him
kill me, Ben.</i>

01:01:03.915 --> 01:01:05.314
<i>I won't.</i>

01:01:05.884 --> 01:01:08.819
<i>Come over here next to me
and I'll keep you safe.</i>

01:01:10.588 --> 01:01:12.453
<i>Don't worry. Come on.</i>

01:01:18.129 --> 01:01:19.391
<i>Hold up your cell phones.</i>

01:01:19.464 --> 01:01:21.193
<i>Use the screens
as flashlights.</i>

01:01:23.835 --> 01:01:25.029
<i>Don't let it go dark
in there.</i>

01:01:25.103 --> 01:01:26.365
Keep the light on each other.

01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:28.098
<i>Keep shining it all
around the elevator.</i>

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.974
<i>Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.</i>

01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:03.873
<i>It just doesn't
make any sense.</i>

01:02:05.943 --> 01:02:07.968
Oh, my God. It is you.

01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:11.804
Please, lady.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:15.510
<i>They can't hear you. You
don't have to pretend anymore.</i>

01:02:15.886 --> 01:02:17.786
We both know who did this.

01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:21.117
Yeah, we do.

01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:35.165
<i>Put down the glass and get
your hands on the wall now!</i>

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.600
I should kill you
right now.

01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:39.699
I should kill you right now
before you try anything else.

01:02:39.776 --> 01:02:41.073
I should cut you right now.

01:02:41.144 --> 01:02:43.806
<i>And what'll be
your defense? Huh?</i>

01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:47.179
<i>"She killed them all,
so I had to kill her"?</i>

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.411
Yeah, something like that.

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:51.518
You take me down,

01:02:52.455 --> 01:02:56.255
<i>they're pinning all of
this on you and you know it.</i>

01:02:57.693 --> 01:03:00.184
A big,
tough guy like yourself.

01:03:02.698 --> 01:03:04.165
This is what he does.

01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:06.401
He wants us to
doubt everything.

01:03:06.635 --> 01:03:07.897
Markowitz.

01:03:08.437 --> 01:03:10.302
<i>Markowitz?
We're getting close, boss.</i>

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.675
Hurry up!

01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:15.610
How would I do it?

01:03:16.012 --> 01:03:17.343
Do what?

01:03:18.681 --> 01:03:22.310
According to your story,
how would I save them?

01:03:24.353 --> 01:03:26.253
<i>There's no easy answer.</i>

01:03:27.623 --> 01:03:29.454
<i>You're never
gonna get these people</i>

01:03:29.592 --> 01:03:31.423
to see themselves
as they really are

01:03:32.528 --> 01:03:34.621
<i>'cause it's the lies
that we tell ourselves,</i>

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.761
they introduce us to him.

01:03:48.844 --> 01:03:50.175
<i>Look at what you're doing.</i>

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.477
<i>Don't think
just because I'm a cop</i>

01:03:52.548 --> 01:03:54.675
<i>I don't know what you're
going through right now.</i>

01:03:57.953 --> 01:03:59.511
<i>I've been to hell.</i>

01:04:03.091 --> 01:04:05.423
Six months ago, I...

01:04:08.463 --> 01:04:12.024
...checked into a hotel and
I nearly drank myself to death.

01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:16.437
<i>The thing is, when
you're self-destructing,</i>

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:18.529
<i>it looks like
it's the world's fault.</i>

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:22.064
<i>Like you're dealt a series of
shit hands, but that's not real.</i>

01:04:22.477 --> 01:04:25.810
Okay? It was all on me. All of it.

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:30.042
I realized my only way out of
hell was to take responsibility

01:04:30.118 --> 01:04:31.642
for what I had become.

01:04:34.322 --> 01:04:36.654
You are responsible for this.

01:04:36.891 --> 01:04:38.153
<i>You realize that,
don't you?</i>

01:04:38.226 --> 01:04:40.717
<i>Take responsibility
for what you're doing.</i>

01:04:43.031 --> 01:04:44.589
Put down the glass.

01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:49.296
<i>Put down the glass.</i>

01:04:56.878 --> 01:04:59.278
<i>I'll put this down
if you do, too.</i>

01:05:00.115 --> 01:05:01.582
Okay?

01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:04.815
<i>We'll call a truce.</i>

01:05:29.476 --> 01:05:30.738
<i>Good.</i>

01:05:31.612 --> 01:05:33.341
<i>You're doing the right thing.</i>

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.942
Sir, we found a woman who thinks
she knows someone in the elevator.

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:41.685
Send her in.

01:05:43.557 --> 01:05:44.649
No.

01:05:45.492 --> 01:05:47.050
Get in there!
Get in there! Now!

01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:49.326
<i>We're through!</i>

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.532
<font color="#804040">CHOl :</font> This is the woman
I was telling you...

01:06:34.674 --> 01:06:36.141
Hold her outside!

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:37.335
Tony.

01:06:40.112 --> 01:06:41.136
You know him?

01:06:41.447 --> 01:06:44.280
<i>He's my fiancé. He had a
job interview here today</i>

01:06:44.383 --> 01:06:46.374
<i>and he didn't want to
bring his tools in with him.</i>

01:06:46.452 --> 01:06:47.441
I was late picking them up.

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:48.679
Tony what?

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.187
Janekowski.
Tony Janekowski.

01:06:55.861 --> 01:06:58.421
Jane Kowski is Janekowski?

01:06:59.565 --> 01:07:02.033
He signed in.
Then who is...

01:07:02.401 --> 01:07:04.767
Come on, breathe. Right
there. Come on, breathe.

01:07:05.571 --> 01:07:09.234
Breathe! Come on,
come on. Please breathe.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:14.541
<i>It's her! It's her.</i>

01:07:16.816 --> 01:07:18.113
Get in there already.

01:07:20.486 --> 01:07:22.249
Who are you?
Today?

01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:24.554
<i>I'm an old woman.</i>

01:07:25.424 --> 01:07:27.483
Grab her
the moment you get in.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.427
Are you ready for
your turn, Anthony?

01:09:21.205 --> 01:09:22.536
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:09:23.407 --> 01:09:24.874
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:27.475
The whores, the liars,
the cheats and the deserters,

01:09:27.544 --> 01:09:29.273
<i>it's always the same thing.</i>

01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:32.211
You know who I am now.

01:09:32.448 --> 01:09:33.814
Yes?

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:38.212
Take me.

01:09:38.287 --> 01:09:39.312
I intend to.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:43.189
No, take me instead.
I deserve this.

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:45.327
<i>You don't
believe that.</i>

01:09:45.429 --> 01:09:47.953
Yes. Yeah, I do.

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:51.125
I should never have left.

01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:53.862
<i>It's my fault.
It's all my fault.</i>

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:56.166
You think you can make
some kind of bargain?

01:09:56.639 --> 01:09:58.197
Take me instead. Please.

01:09:58.341 --> 01:09:59.330
Stop saying that!

01:10:15.992 --> 01:10:17.619
You think this will
make you good?

01:10:17.794 --> 01:10:19.022
<i>You're not good.</i>

01:10:19.228 --> 01:10:20.388
I know.

01:10:20.563 --> 01:10:22.497
You think you can make up
for the choices you made?

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.960
No.

01:10:26.536 --> 01:10:28.197
You think you can
be forgiven?

01:10:28.504 --> 01:10:29.732
No.

01:10:31.307 --> 01:10:32.296
Channel eight.

01:10:33.476 --> 01:10:36.468
I killed a mother and her son
on Bethlehem Pike

01:10:36.546 --> 01:10:37.911
five years ago.

01:10:39.215 --> 01:10:40.273
Uh.

01:10:40.883 --> 01:10:43.716
It was a hit-and-run
and I was never caught.

01:10:49.025 --> 01:10:50.583
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:11:17.586 --> 01:11:18.575
No.

01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:34.594
Damn.

01:11:36.037 --> 01:11:37.800
I really wanted you.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:05.256
Come on, come on, come on!

01:12:14.275 --> 01:12:15.606
Where is she?

01:12:16.477 --> 01:12:18.138
<i>Where'd she go?</i>

01:13:29.382 --> 01:13:30.872
<i>I'll take him in.</i>

01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:15.751
That was my family
on Bethlehem Pike.

01:14:19.732 --> 01:14:21.393
That was my son.

01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:34.642
<i>I've been waiting for
this moment for five years.</i>

01:14:34.714 --> 01:14:36.977
<i>All the things
I'd say to you</i>

01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:39.882
<i>and what I'd do.</i>

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:48.782
The thing is...

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:56.091
...I forgive you.

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:06.804
<i>After my mother would finish her
story, she would always comfort us.</i>

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:09.639
<i>"Don't worry," she'd say.</i>

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:15.384
<i>"If the Devil is real,
then God must be real, too. "</i>
