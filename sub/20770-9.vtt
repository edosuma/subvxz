02:23.853 --> 02:24.937
Thank you, Tammy.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.105
You're welcome.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.443
Patched in through the office,

02:31.569 --> 02:34.155
it's a Colonel Davis for you
at the Pentagon.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.573
Urgent.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.366
Try to keep your voice down.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.659
What?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.121
Hello?

02:43.205 --> 02:44.790
Colonel?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.292
What have you got?

02:49.086 --> 02:52.047
I don't appreciate your language
one bit, Colonel.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.137
Oh, a place.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.389
Buckhorn.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.141
Buckhorn, South Dakota.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.853
West South Dakota.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.940
Well, by golly, we're over
east South Dakota right now.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.195
Take this down.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.197
Hold on.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.033
Capital K,

03:19.158 --> 03:20.951
small N,

03:21.076 --> 03:22.995
small O,

03:23.120 --> 03:25.247
small X,

03:25.372 --> 03:26.665
Knox.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.043
Lieutenant Knox.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.587
Buckhorn Police Department.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.797
All right.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.382
Thank you, Colonel.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.309
Hey, partner.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.436
We was expecting you last night.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.315
Looks like you've been spilling.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.525
Who owns this establishment?

03:53.651 --> 03:54.693
Farmers.

03:55.903 --> 03:56.862
Where are they?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.697
Oh, they're sleeping out back.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.866
What you need?

04:02.660 --> 04:04.870
A couple clean phones.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.538
And something for this.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.749
Well, fuck that.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.918
I'll get you some real nice
puppies and biscuits.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.670
Hey, Chantal.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.296
Boss man's here.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.381
Grab the kit.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.174
Is he hurt?

04:19.134 --> 04:21.053
Shit.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.138
We was waiting for you
all night.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.598
Where'd they get you?

04:29.645 --> 04:30.604
Ooh.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.275
Looks like you was lucky.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.609
I'll get the kit.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.236
Go on inside.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.918
Rather than return directly
to Philadelphia,

04:53.043 --> 04:56.213
would you mind
if we made a short trip

04:56.338 --> 04:59.216
to Buckhorn, South Dakota?

04:59.341 --> 05:00.759
It's quite important.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.929
Fuck you, Gordon.
I want to go home.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.806
This is important,

05:05.931 --> 05:08.809
and it could be of interest
to you, Diane.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.730
An old case involving a man

05:12.855 --> 05:15.190
Agent Cooper once knew.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.235
The Blue Rose case.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.653
Yes.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.285
Coming up.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.662
Got to talk to the pilot first.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.713
There's been a change of plan.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.175
We're going over
to Buckhorn, South Dakota.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.763
I know.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.932
I know.
"Fuck you, Albert."

06:09.953 --> 06:11.288
Agent Preston.

06:12.790 --> 06:13.832
Good.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.876
Yes, I understand.
I'll get him.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.969
It's Warden Murphy.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.183
Warden Murphy?

06:31.308 --> 06:32.893
<i>Your man Cooper escaped.</i>

06:33.018 --> 06:34.144
What?

06:35.354 --> 06:37.272
How the hell did that happen?

06:39.608 --> 06:41.402
Cooper flew the coop.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.118
<i>Did you do it?</i>

07:31.243 --> 07:32.244
Not yet.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.164
Better be done next time I call.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.815
Roger, come in here.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.115
How's that, boss?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.367
It's real good, Hutch.

08:12.493 --> 08:13.660
All right.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.174
I want you to kill a warden
within the next two days.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.383
A warden?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.635
All right.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.515
You want Chantal to mess
with him before I kill him?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.892
He'll sing for me.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.186
Whatever you want.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.230
Then I got a doubleheader
for you in Vegas.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.273
Oh, let's play two.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.443
I'll text you details
after you do the warden.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.028
Remember this.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.532
Warden Murphy,
Yankton Federal Prison.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.992
Kill him at home, at work,

08:54.117 --> 08:55.369
or on the way.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.913
Okay.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.748
Hey, Chantal,

08:59.873 --> 09:01.750
give the boss man a wet one.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.181
I wish it was more.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.183
I'll take a rain check.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.185
You got it, sweetheart.

09:29.820 --> 09:30.988
Kill that phone.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.990
And clear out of this place.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.325
The main road is that way.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
He ever give any problems?

10:06.690 --> 10:09.985
No, I never had any trouble
with Dougie at all.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.988
He's a...solid citizen.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.907
So you can't think of any reason

10:16.033 --> 10:17.659
why someone would try
to kill him.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.745
Not off the top of my head.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.788
Of course,
in the insurance business,

10:21.913 --> 10:23.665
folks have been known
to hold a grudge

10:23.790 --> 10:25.709
if things don't go their way.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.128
It's usually about money,
Bushnell.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.379
Pure and simple.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.757
Nobody needs more reason
than that.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.175
So what's his background?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.010
How long has he been with you?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.511
Twelve years now.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.055
He's a good worker.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.015
He's slow, steady.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.808
Little more emphasis
on the "slow."

10:44.144 --> 10:46.855
Dougie had a car accident,
as I recall,

10:46.980 --> 10:49.566
not long before
he came to work for me.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.068
Every once in a while,

10:51.193 --> 10:54.529
he shows some lingering effects.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.990
His wife can talk to that
better than I can.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.995
Well...

11:02.120 --> 11:04.164
we appreciate
you coming down, Bushnell.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.423
Well, I really appreciate
your help.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.687
Damn strange business.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.024
First his car blows up,

11:31.149 --> 11:33.318
and then somebody
tries to kill him.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.130
We'll get back to you
as soon as we have something.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.993
Dougie, you can take
the rest of the day off.

12:23.118 --> 12:26.288
Well, that's great, because
I can take him to the doctor.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.914
Starting tomorrow,

12:28.039 --> 12:30.000
you and I are gonna
work together

12:30.125 --> 12:31.668
and get some answers.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.087
Answers.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.812
So get this.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.857
There is nothing,
and I mean nothing,

12:53.982 --> 12:55.776
on our Mr. Douglas Jones

12:55.901 --> 12:58.820
prior to 1997.

12:59.988 --> 13:00.947
You're shitting me.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.991
No driver's license.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.328
No passport.
No social.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.414
Class records.
Tax records.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.375
No birth certificate.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.212
I'll be damned.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.553
Witness protection?

13:25.555 --> 13:26.932
Maybe.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.817
You still got that guy
at Justice?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.861
I'll run it by him.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.328
Did you get
that taillight fixed?

13:48.453 --> 13:51.414
To the tune of 239 bucks

13:51.540 --> 13:54.125
for a fuckin' taillight.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.672
Must be a beauty.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.261
Remember the Australian guy
with the pliers?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.490
Should we talk to him again?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.955
It's like talking to a dog.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.040
And she does all the barking.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.300
I have an idea.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.413
Brought you a fresh one,
Mr. Jones.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.128
Can I get you one too, ma'am?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.546
Oh, no, thanks,

15:21.671 --> 15:23.131
but thanks for bringing one
for Dougie.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.507
Yeah.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.734
Got ya.

15:42.859 --> 15:43.860
Hey, Fuscos?

15:43.985 --> 15:45.278
Yes?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.864
Sergeant.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.574
Just in time.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.201
Prints and DNA, please.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.411
Hey, I was just coming
to tell you

15:53.536 --> 15:57.040
that those palm prints came back
off that gun.

15:57.165 --> 16:01.670
Our old friend Ike the Spike...

16:01.795 --> 16:04.589
and we just got a 20 on him

16:04.714 --> 16:06.591
at an off-Strip motel.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.344
Ike the Spike
finally fucked himself.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.138
Hey, let's join the fun.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.433
Sarge, let the Joneses go.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.769
I got to log this first.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.145
All right.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.928
Hey, look.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.429
The right one?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.687
Yeah, right.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.272
Look, there's a scratch
right there, buddy.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.315
All right, let's go.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.578
Message for JT.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.205
Been trying your cell.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.916
No luck, so trying this line.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.876
Here's the message.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.878
No cigar.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.797
Taking medical leave.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.984
Oh, please tell me
he's still here.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.694
Is he in there?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.093
All right, towards me.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.454
<i>He's coming your way.</i>

20:08.958 --> 20:10.877
Ike, you're under arrest

20:11.002 --> 20:12.462
for attempted murder.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.964
We have your palm print.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.758
As a matter of fact, Ike,

20:16.883 --> 20:18.259
we have your whole palm.

21:06.641 --> 21:10.937
Andy, I really love
the beige chair.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.752
And, Lucy, I really love
the red chair.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.647
And I really love
the beige chair, Andy.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.260
I'm sorry, punky.

22:24.385 --> 22:27.013
You can get the beige chair.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.221
Mary, what are you doing?

23:11.349 --> 23:14.143
Who let him out?

23:16.938 --> 23:18.314
Where is he?

23:21.359 --> 23:22.902
Johnny!

23:23.945 --> 23:26.364
Johnny, where are you?

23:32.829 --> 23:34.580
Johnny!

23:39.460 --> 23:40.711
Johnny.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.886
Johnny!

23:49.011 --> 23:50.263
Johnny!

23:50.388 --> 23:52.807
Oh, my God.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.059
Oh, my God.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.437
Johnny.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.152
Ma?

24:05.820 --> 24:07.321
Hey, Bobby, what's up?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.157
- You want some coffee?
- Oh, no, thanks.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.324
I'm here with the fellas.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.617
We need to talk to you.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.327
I need to ask you
some questions.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.121
Okay.

24:16.038 --> 24:16.956
Come on in, fellas.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.255
Mrs. Briggs.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.214
Ma'am.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.799
Gentlemen.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.385
We're here to talk to you
about Agent Cooper's visit

24:29.510 --> 24:31.345
with the Major the day...

24:33.139 --> 24:35.475
The day before Garland died.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.144
Yes.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.772
All right, listen to me.

24:45.067 --> 24:49.030
Right after Agent Cooper
left that day,

24:49.155 --> 24:52.241
Garland pulled me aside,

24:52.366 --> 24:56.287
and he said that one day...

24:56.412 --> 24:59.832
our son Bobby

24:59.957 --> 25:02.084
and Hawk

25:02.210 --> 25:04.462
and Sheriff Truman‒

25:04.587 --> 25:08.925
I didn't know it would be
this Sheriff Truman.

25:09.050 --> 25:12.762
He said that they would
come and ask me

25:12.887 --> 25:15.389
about Special Agent Dale Cooper.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.727
He squeezed my shoulders

25:19.852 --> 25:22.021
when he told me this.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.401
I tried to ask him
what it was about, but he‒he‒

25:27.527 --> 25:29.820
he wouldn't say any more.

25:29.946 --> 25:33.616
He just said,

25:33.741 --> 25:38.329
"When they come to ask you
about Agent Cooper,

25:38.454 --> 25:40.081
you give them this."

25:45.086 --> 25:46.796
And now you're here.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.344
Would you fellas like
some coffee?

25:53.469 --> 25:54.637
- No, no.
- No, ma'am.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.806
Thank you.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.975
All right.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.851
Come with me.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.073
This is the chair.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.911
I can't believe
this day has come.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.041
Watch right here.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.728
Bobby, when your father
told me this,

26:43.853 --> 26:46.063
you were a very long way

26:46.188 --> 26:47.440
from where you are today.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.445
Somehow, he knew

26:52.570 --> 26:55.281
that it would all turn out well.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.951
He saw this life for you.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.001
Your father never
lost faith in you.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.772
Well, fellas,
let's have that coffee.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.023
- Yeah.
- Yes.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.232
- Yeah?
- You bet.

27:30.358 --> 27:31.400
Okay.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.569
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.998
The waiting room.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.875
They're right behind us.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.794
Ah.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.630
- Lieutenant Knox.
- Sir.

27:52.755 --> 27:53.756
Macklay.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.052
Diane.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.180
I'm not in the mood
to see a dead body this morning.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.973
I'll just wait for you guys here.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.685
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't smoke here.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.108
It's a fucking morgue!

28:16.654 --> 28:17.905
This way.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.456
Fuckin' pansies.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.246
Detective Macklay handled
the case when it came in.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.081
He'll brief you on background.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.252
William Hastings
was having an affair

29:13.377 --> 29:16.756
with the local librarian,
Ruth Davenport.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.758
Now, Davenport's head was found

29:18.883 --> 29:22.887
atop the headless body
of your Major Briggs.

29:23.012 --> 29:26.515
Once we took Hastings
into custody,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.226
his wife was murdered
in their house,

29:29.351 --> 29:30.895
apparently by their lawyer,

29:31.020 --> 29:32.438
a man named George Bautzer,

29:32.563 --> 29:35.024
who is now also in custody.

29:35.149 --> 29:36.984
And the next day,

29:37.109 --> 29:40.613
Hastings' secretary died
in a car explosion.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.990
What happens in season two?

29:45.409 --> 29:48.037
Apologies in advance for Albert.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.471
Well, this is your Major Briggs.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.479
It turns out
that William Hastings,

30:13.604 --> 30:16.273
along with the help
of Ruth the librarian,

30:16.398 --> 30:19.318
was researching and publishing

30:19.443 --> 30:21.028
some strange little blog

30:21.153 --> 30:24.657
about some alternate dimension.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.953
This from the principal
of your local high school.

30:29.078 --> 30:32.331
Not to mention, marble champion
of the sixth grade.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.709
When did he lose his marbles?

30:37.294 --> 30:40.047
When the dog got his cat's-eyes.

30:46.428 --> 30:49.431
About one week ago,
Hastings ended his blog entry

30:49.557 --> 30:52.309
with this cryptic sentence:

30:52.434 --> 30:56.897
"Today we finally entered
what we call the Zone,

30:57.022 --> 30:59.191
and we met the Major."

31:05.823 --> 31:08.367
This is the body of a man
in his 40s.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.037
Yes.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.543
Albert.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.176
Let's think out loud.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.512
Major Briggs would have been 72.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.806
As you know,
we thought he died in a fire

31:30.931 --> 31:34.018
in that government facility
outside Twin Peaks...

31:34.143 --> 31:36.145
25 years ago.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.731
About the age this man is now.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.362
Well, consider this.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.698
Cooper knew Briggs.

31:47.823 --> 31:51.452
Cooper was around Briggs
25 years ago,

31:51.577 --> 31:55.080
and now Cooper shows up
in this neck of the woods.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.584
On the loose
in this neck of the woods.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.462
Right.

32:18.145 --> 32:21.607
And I found this in his stomach.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.233
It‒it's inscribed.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.278
It says, "To Dougie,

32:26.403 --> 32:29.448
love, Janey-E."

32:35.412 --> 32:39.291
We need to speak
with this William Hastings.

34:38.911 --> 34:39.828
Go away!

34:52.549 --> 34:54.218
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.055
Hey, Lucy.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.682
Sheriff Truman,
I'm not here.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.102
I'm on my lunch break.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.949
Oh, Sheriff.
Oh.

35:17.074 --> 35:19.284
No lunch in the conference room,
Chad.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.412
I know, but...

35:22.538 --> 35:24.665
you guys have doughnuts and coffee
in here all the time.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.043
Chad, take your lunch
to the lunchroom.

35:29.711 --> 35:30.546
Sure thing.

35:30.671 --> 35:31.964
No problem, Sheriff.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.258
Sorry.

35:35.425 --> 35:36.885
Won't happen again.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.312
Oh, jeez.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.493
Oh, come on.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.500
Could you get the door?

36:12.504 --> 36:13.672
Little help here?

36:26.059 --> 36:27.436
Bobby, open a window.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.979
Yeah.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.785
No seams.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.579
No openings.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.415
How the heck are you supposed
to open this thing?

36:48.540 --> 36:51.627
Maybe there's a hidden button
somewhere.

36:51.752 --> 36:54.504
I don't see any hidden button.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.301
What are you smiling at?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.892
I know how to open that.

37:07.017 --> 37:08.769
My dad brought one home
one night.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.104
You having fun with us, Bobby?

37:11.230 --> 37:14.191
Yeah, sort of.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.734
Go for it.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.612
We got to go back outside.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.905
Outside?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.449
Yeah, we got to go back outside.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.262
Okay.

37:56.566 --> 37:57.401
What the‒

37:57.526 --> 37:59.111
Shh.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.406
"Two hundred fifty-three yards

38:44.531 --> 38:48.243
east of Jack Rabbit's Palace.

38:49.745 --> 38:52.581
Before leaving
Jack Rabbit's Palace,

38:52.706 --> 38:54.541
put some soil
from that area

38:54.666 --> 38:56.376
in your pocket."

38:56.501 --> 38:58.628
And two dates.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.589
And a time.

39:00.714 --> 39:01.673
Same time.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.842
2:53.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.721
That's two days from now,

39:07.846 --> 39:09.181
and the day after.

39:12.434 --> 39:15.312
Jack Rabbit's Palace?

39:15.437 --> 39:17.481
I never heard of such a place.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.316
He did it again.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.360
Wow.

39:21.485 --> 39:22.944
What?

39:23.070 --> 39:24.946
What is it, Bobby?

39:25.072 --> 39:28.992
I know exactly where
Jack Rabbit's Palace is.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.578
My dad, when I was a little kid,

39:31.703 --> 39:33.789
he took me to this place.

39:33.914 --> 39:36.875
It was near where his station
used to be.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.795
It was our make-believe world,

39:39.920 --> 39:43.465
you know,
where we made up stories.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.553
I was the one who named it
Jack Rabbit's Palace.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.351
He saw all this.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.107
Whatever this is.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.442
That's my dad.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.238
We'll go up there
two days from now,

40:06.363 --> 40:08.740
and you can lead the way,

40:08.865 --> 40:10.909
just as your dad wanted.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.746
Wait a minute.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.459
There's something else.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.257
"COOPER/COOPER."

40:28.093 --> 40:29.928
Two Coopers.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.456
We came out to join you, Diane,

40:57.581 --> 41:00.125
while Albert's indisposed.

42:05.315 --> 42:07.025
Gordon.

42:17.577 --> 42:18.912
Whoa!

42:24.960 --> 42:27.504
We used to smoke together,
way back when.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.381
You remember?

42:29.506 --> 42:31.383
Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.

42:33.802 --> 42:34.761
We sure did.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.680
Thanks, Diane.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.725
You don't want to finish it off?

42:55.323 --> 42:56.408
Tammy.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.083
Hello, Mr. Hastings.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.586
I'm Agent Tammy Preston
of the FBI.

43:09.004 --> 43:12.966
Oh, God, the FBI.

43:15.385 --> 43:17.137
Mr. Hastings,

43:17.262 --> 43:19.139
I'm also recording
our conversation.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.098
Okay.

43:20.223 --> 43:23.018
Would you state your name
and age for the record?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.146
William Hastings.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.939
I'm 43.

43:30.317 --> 43:32.736
Mr. Hastings, are you the author

43:32.861 --> 43:35.447
<i>of an online journal or blog</i>

43:35.572 --> 43:37.115
<i>entitled</i>
The Search for the Zone<i>?</i>

43:37.240 --> 43:40.577
<i>Uh-huh. Yes.</i>

43:40.702 --> 43:43.496
<i>What sort of things
do you write about?</i>

43:43.622 --> 43:45.415
<i>Different things.</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:47.042
<i>Approximately two weeks ago,</i>

43:47.167 --> 43:49.336
<i>did you write an entry
about encountering</i>

43:49.461 --> 43:52.964
what you described
as an alternate reality?

43:53.089 --> 43:55.884
A different dimension.

43:56.009 --> 43:58.219
Yes, but it's real.

43:58.345 --> 44:00.430
It's all real.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.932
How long have you been
interested in this subject,

44:03.058 --> 44:04.976
Mr. Hastings?

44:05.101 --> 44:05.935
Many years.

44:06.061 --> 44:09.689
I do‒I do a lot of reading.

44:09.814 --> 44:13.193
But this time, you wrote
that you actually found

44:13.318 --> 44:15.528
and entered such a place.

44:15.654 --> 44:16.571
Yes.

44:16.696 --> 44:18.365
And that while in this place,

44:18.490 --> 44:21.368
you wrote, and I quote,

44:21.493 --> 44:23.203
"We met the Major."

44:25.455 --> 44:27.165
Yeah. Yes.

44:28.708 --> 44:31.419
<i>You see,
Ruth was very good at...</i>

44:31.544 --> 44:35.715
<i>...uncovering hidden records.</i>

44:35.840 --> 44:39.302
And she had indications
that if we went to a certain place

44:39.427 --> 44:42.055
at a certain time,

44:42.180 --> 44:45.892
we would enter the dimension

44:46.017 --> 44:49.771
and make contact
with a certain person.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.314
And so we went there.

44:51.439 --> 44:54.067
And that's where you found
the Major.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.444
He was hiding there,

44:56.569 --> 44:58.697
or "hibernating," as he said.

44:58.822 --> 45:00.156
And other people may‒

45:00.281 --> 45:01.908
were maybe gonna find him,

45:02.033 --> 45:04.619
and he wanted to go
to a different place,

45:04.744 --> 45:09.207
and so he asked us
to get him numbers.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.334
Important numbers.

45:13.002 --> 45:13.878
Coordinates.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.049
<i>And we found them in the place
he told us to go,</i>

45:18.174 --> 45:20.176
<i>a secure military database.</i>

45:20.301 --> 45:21.886
<i>Do you still have
those coordinates?</i>

45:22.011 --> 45:23.012
<i>No, Ruth had them.</i>

45:23.138 --> 45:25.974
She wrote 'em on her hand,
though,

45:26.099 --> 45:28.601
so that she wouldn't forget.

45:29.978 --> 45:30.812
Sorry.

45:30.937 --> 45:33.064
What happened then, William?

45:37.694 --> 45:41.114
We brought him back the numbers
last Thursday.

45:42.991 --> 45:45.410
And then something terrible
happened.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.664
These others‒

45:49.789 --> 45:51.040
these others came in,

45:51.166 --> 45:52.625
and they grabbed me
by the neck,

45:52.751 --> 45:54.711
and they pushed‒
they pushed me down.

45:54.836 --> 45:56.546
They said,
"What's your wife's name?

45:56.671 --> 45:58.715
What's your wife's name?"

45:58.840 --> 46:01.009
<i>"Phyllis, " I said.</i>

46:01.134 --> 46:03.553
<i>I didn't kill Ruth.</i>

46:03.678 --> 46:04.763
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

46:04.888 --> 46:06.556
You‒you have to believe me.

46:06.681 --> 46:07.640
I loved her.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.769
This is all my fault.

46:10.894 --> 46:12.270
This is all my fault.

46:12.395 --> 46:15.565
It never should have happened.

46:15.690 --> 46:19.152
William, are any of these
six photographs I'm showing you

46:19.277 --> 46:20.945
the man you call the Major?

46:28.870 --> 46:31.039
That's the Major.

46:34.667 --> 46:37.754
Draw a circle around the photo
of the man you call the Major.

46:37.879 --> 46:39.464
Sign and date it.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.301
Yes, ma'am.

47:02.487 --> 47:05.198
Can you tell me what happened?

47:11.037 --> 47:13.414
We gave him the numbers.

47:15.458 --> 47:18.795
And he started to float up...

47:21.005 --> 47:22.966
...and he said some words.

47:24.634 --> 47:27.846
"Cooper. Cooper."

47:27.971 --> 47:30.640
Right before his head
disappeared.

47:30.765 --> 47:33.977
<i>It was something like no one
has ever seen before.</i>

47:34.102 --> 47:35.895
<i>I've never seen anything
like it.</i>

47:36.020 --> 47:37.397
I‒I've never‒I've‒

47:37.522 --> 47:39.732
I've never read anything
like it.

47:39.858 --> 47:43.862
You don't know.
You weren't there.

47:43.987 --> 47:46.739
It was‒he‒

47:46.865 --> 47:48.283
he...

47:49.701 --> 47:53.621
It was beautiful.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.832
And then Ruth was dead.

47:55.957 --> 47:58.626
It was so terrible,

47:58.751 --> 48:01.880
and I had‒
I had to hold her.

48:03.756 --> 48:05.717
And then‒and then I woke up,

48:05.842 --> 48:10.346
and I was in‒
I was in my home.

48:10.471 --> 48:12.390
I was in my home.

48:12.515 --> 48:15.518
Did the Major kill Ruth?

48:15.643 --> 48:18.938
No, there were
so many people there.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.399
You have to believe me.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.526
Please, I didn't kill Ruth.

48:23.651 --> 48:25.904
I loved her.
I loved her.

48:26.029 --> 48:29.198
I don't know
what is happening to me.

48:29.324 --> 48:32.201
Why can't you help me, please?

48:32.327 --> 48:33.411
Please.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.997
We were so happy together.

48:36.122 --> 48:40.168
We were gonna go to the Bahamas.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.338
We were gonna...

48:43.463 --> 48:44.923
scuba dive

48:45.048 --> 48:49.218
and drink mixed drinks
on the beach.

48:49.344 --> 48:53.389
And we were gonna
soak up the sun.

48:54.724 --> 48:57.936
And look
at the beautiful sunsets.

48:58.061 --> 49:00.939
<i>She said to me</i>‒
<i>she said, "Bill, let's just go.</i>

49:01.064 --> 49:02.315
Let's just do it.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.900
Let's go to the Bahamas.

49:04.025 --> 49:06.778
Let's go scuba diving."

49:09.030 --> 49:12.492
I want to go scuba diving.

49:18.790 --> 49:20.625
Fruitcake, anyone?

49:50.029 --> 49:51.406
Hmm.

50:06.629 --> 50:09.048
Security couldn't find anything?

50:09.173 --> 50:10.341
Mm-mm.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.012
They checked everywhere.

50:14.137 --> 50:15.221
Hmm.

50:37.326 --> 50:40.538
It seems to be loudest here.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.123
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

50:45.752 --> 50:49.130
It's, um...

50:49.255 --> 50:53.217
it's kind of a mesmerizing tone.

50:54.343 --> 50:56.179
Yes.

50:56.304 --> 51:00.141
The ring out
of a monastery bell

51:00.266 --> 51:02.351
has the same quality.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.689
Or the‒hmm.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.691
Otherworldly.

51:21.329 --> 51:22.830
Beverly.

51:29.170 --> 51:31.005
I can't do this.

51:33.883 --> 51:35.760
I don't know why it is.

51:45.186 --> 51:47.021
You're a good man, Ben.

52:44.871 --> 52:47.165
You know that zebra's out again?

53:00.386 --> 53:03.347
Uh...haven't seen you in a while.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.142
I got another job.

53:06.267 --> 53:07.602
Oh, yeah?

53:07.727 --> 53:09.353
What happened?

53:09.478 --> 53:10.521
I got fired.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.064
That fucker fired me.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.278
That's fucked.

53:17.403 --> 53:19.113
How come?

53:19.238 --> 53:22.158
I came in high a couple times,
I guess.

53:22.283 --> 53:23.868
You guess?

53:25.578 --> 53:26.871
Yeah.

53:28.873 --> 53:29.957
Fuck.

53:31.209 --> 53:32.543
I can't remember.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.964
You know what I mean.
What's the big fucking deal?

53:37.089 --> 53:39.175
I mean, I did the fucking work.

53:44.513 --> 53:46.265
Like, how can you fuck up
serving burgers,

53:46.390 --> 53:47.683
you know what I mean?

53:52.939 --> 53:54.899
I got some kind of wicked rash.

54:01.697 --> 54:03.366
So where are you working now?

54:03.491 --> 54:05.076
Across the fucking street,

54:05.201 --> 54:06.327
serving burgers.

54:13.626 --> 54:15.336
Oh, shit.

54:15.461 --> 54:16.671
Yep.

54:37.483 --> 54:39.318
Have you seen that penguin?

54:39.443 --> 54:41.946
Have I‒what?

54:42.071 --> 54:44.031
You know, the penguin.
