04:15.336 --> 04:17.551
Piedmont, New Mexico.

04:17.552 --> 04:19.538
Population 68.

04:27.949 --> 04:30.376
Come on.

04:39.263 --> 04:41.497
I didn't notice them before.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.267
That's crazy. I didn't know
buzzards fly at night.

04:44.268 --> 04:47.671
That's what they look like.

04:47.672 --> 04:50.566
Here.

04:52.877 --> 04:56.614
Boy, that's some dead burg.

04:58.484 --> 05:01.617
Buzzards only come
when something's dead.

05:08.128 --> 05:11.124
Well, I guess we better
go in and have a look.

05:25.347 --> 05:27.415
This is Caper One to Vandal Deca.

05:27.416 --> 05:30.419
Caper One to Vandal Deca.
Are you reading? Over.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.721
Yes, I'm reading. Over.

05:32.722 --> 05:34.827
We're about to enter
the town of Piedmont

05:34.828 --> 05:36.480
and recover the satellite.

05:38.028 --> 05:39.116
Very good, Caper One.

05:39.117 --> 05:40.430
Leave your radio open.

05:40.431 --> 05:43.962
Roger.

05:45.135 --> 05:48.238
We're now inside the town.

05:48.239 --> 05:50.774
It's kind of spooky.

05:50.775 --> 05:53.577
I see a church steeple
ahead on the left.

05:53.578 --> 05:56.448
It's quiet here.

05:56.449 --> 05:58.159
It's the damndest thing.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.051
There's no sign of life.

06:00.052 --> 06:03.015
The signals from the satellite
are getting very strong.

06:04.858 --> 06:07.760
Sir! You see that, Lieutenant?

06:07.761 --> 06:08.671
See what, Crane?

06:08.672 --> 06:11.164
Over by the fence.
It looks like a body.

06:11.165 --> 06:12.308
Easy, Crane.

06:12.309 --> 06:13.797
You're imagining things.

06:15.703 --> 06:17.102
Holy!

06:17.103 --> 06:19.072
Sir, it's another one.

06:19.073 --> 06:22.777
You're right. It looks dead.

06:22.778 --> 06:23.927
Yes, sir, shall I...

06:23.928 --> 06:25.179
No! Stay in the van.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.074
Vandal Deca to Caper One.

06:27.075 --> 06:28.584
What's happening?

06:28.585 --> 06:30.680
We see bodies, lots of them.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.187
Are you certain, Caper One?

06:32.188 --> 06:34.029
Damn it, Comroe,

06:34.030 --> 06:35.791
of course we're certain.

06:35.792 --> 06:40.496
Your orders are proceed
to satellite and retrieve.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.700
Roger, Vandal Deca.

06:49.641 --> 06:50.673
Stay at your stations!

06:50.674 --> 06:52.239
Hit that security button!

06:53.312 --> 06:56.014
Get me Major Manchek.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.216
Somehow they don't
hardly look dead, Lieutenant.

06:58.217 --> 06:59.594
They're all over the place.

06:59.595 --> 07:00.809
Must be dozens of them.

07:00.810 --> 07:02.622
Damn it, get this call through!

07:02.623 --> 07:03.981
It's sort of like they just

07:03.982 --> 07:05.258
dropped in their tracks, sir.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.250
Sir!

07:06.251 --> 07:09.830
Good Chri..!

07:09.831 --> 07:11.305
Do you see that thing in white?

07:11.306 --> 07:12.766
Yeah, it's coming toward us.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.052
Major, this may sound crazy,

07:14.053 --> 07:15.432
but there's something strange

07:15.433 --> 07:16.737
going on with Caper One.

07:16.738 --> 07:19.853
Sir, I think we should
get out of h...

07:26.550 --> 07:29.082
Hello, Ops, this is Major Manchek,

07:29.083 --> 07:30.753
Scoop Control A-12.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.689
We need a flyby over
Piedmont, New Mexico.

07:33.690 --> 07:35.947
Infrared. A FLIR scan, all sectors.

07:35.948 --> 07:37.961
Film to come direct to Scoop.

07:37.962 --> 07:39.878
Assign Gunner Wilson,

07:39.879 --> 07:43.098
if he's not crocked someplace.

08:10.599 --> 08:12.799
Jeez!

08:48.140 --> 08:50.743
I'm declaring a state of emergency.

08:50.744 --> 08:53.445
All personnel restricted to base.

08:53.446 --> 08:55.074
Everything seen and heard

08:55.075 --> 08:56.925
in that room is top secret.

08:56.926 --> 08:57.979
Yes, sir.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.306
This is a recording.

09:28.307 --> 09:29.617
State your name and

09:29.618 --> 09:31.589
your message and hang up.

09:31.590 --> 09:33.267
Major Arthur Manchek,

09:33.268 --> 09:35.693
Scoop Mission Control A-12.

09:35.694 --> 09:37.828
I recommend calling
a Wildfire Alert.

09:37.829 --> 09:39.401
We have evidence here on film

09:39.402 --> 09:40.971
of unnatural death caused by

09:40.972 --> 09:42.701
Scoop 7 returning to earth.

09:42.702 --> 09:46.904
Time check 0-1-4-7 inclusive.

10:36.862 --> 10:39.765
We'd like to see
Dr. Jeremy Stone, please.

10:39.766 --> 10:41.572
Well, I'm Mrs. Stone.

10:41.573 --> 10:44.969
We are having a party. May I...

10:47.474 --> 10:49.676
Does that man have a gun?

10:49.677 --> 10:51.778
Ma'am, we must see Dr. Stone.

10:51.779 --> 10:53.279
What is this?

10:53.280 --> 10:55.547
Please call Dr. Stone to the door.

10:55.548 --> 10:57.584
Otherwise we'll go get him.

10:57.585 --> 11:00.285
Just a minute.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.793
I'll just wait here, ma'am.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.895
I'll come to Berkeley
anytime, Stone.

11:06.896 --> 11:09.931
That $4 million must be
your largest federal grant.

11:09.932 --> 11:12.401
May I see you, Jeremy?

11:12.402 --> 11:16.005
The S.D.S. Has arrived, no doubt.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.603
Jeremy, there are some
Army types in the hall

11:18.604 --> 11:20.444
and two more outside with guns.

11:20.445 --> 11:21.830
They want to see you.

11:21.831 --> 11:23.413
I'll take care of it.

11:23.414 --> 11:24.837
Jeremy! If you knew about this,

11:24.838 --> 11:26.016
you might've told...

11:26.017 --> 11:28.912
I didn't. I'll explain later.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.424
I'm Dr. Stone.

11:33.425 --> 11:35.426
Yes. I'm Captain Morton.

11:35.427 --> 11:38.322
There's a fire, sir.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.768
I've got to leave.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.136
For God's sakes, Jeremy!

11:45.137 --> 11:47.574
When will you be back?

11:47.575 --> 11:48.627
I'm not sure.

11:48.628 --> 11:50.477
The guns, is it...

11:50.478 --> 11:51.947
Mrs. Stone, it's our job

11:51.948 --> 11:53.647
to protect your husband.

11:53.648 --> 11:56.283
From now on, nothing must
be allowed to happen to him.

11:56.284 --> 11:59.053
I'll be safe as in your arms.

11:59.054 --> 12:01.846
Jeremy? Jeremy!

12:25.316 --> 12:28.347
You tell the senator
it's his daughter!

12:30.089 --> 12:32.090
Allison?

12:32.091 --> 12:34.968
Dad, something very
peculiar has just happened,

12:34.969 --> 12:35.995
even for Jeremy.

12:35.996 --> 12:37.720
A few minutes ago...

12:38.598 --> 12:39.830
Dad, are you there?

12:39.831 --> 12:41.100
What's going on?

12:41.101 --> 12:42.586
This communication

12:42.587 --> 12:44.446
is being monitored. The connection

12:44.447 --> 12:47.307
has been broken for reasons
of national security.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.843
You will be briefed
at the appropriate time.

12:49.844 --> 12:53.376
Thank you for your
cooperation, Mrs. Stone.

13:26.853 --> 13:28.386
I feel like Onassis.

13:28.387 --> 13:30.455
It was the fastest thing
we could arrange, sir.

13:30.456 --> 13:33.059
Thanks.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.861
Yes?

13:34.862 --> 13:35.800
General Sparks here.

13:35.801 --> 13:37.263
I just wanted to inform you

13:37.264 --> 13:40.009
that all members of your
team have been cleared

13:40.010 --> 13:41.768
and are now being called in.

13:41.769 --> 13:43.002
Except for Professor Kirke.

13:43.003 --> 13:44.805
He's in the hospital. Appendectomy.

13:44.806 --> 13:46.502
You'll get complete
details on everything

13:46.503 --> 13:47.774
when your team is assembled.

13:47.775 --> 13:48.665
You don't make sense.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.478
You talk like you've
been brainwashed.

13:50.479 --> 13:52.413
You don't understand.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.110
Germ warfare people, Dad?

13:54.111 --> 13:55.203
A lab accident?

13:55.204 --> 13:56.184
Thank you.

13:56.185 --> 13:57.624
It's different this time.

13:57.625 --> 13:58.769
Don't pack, Claire,

13:58.770 --> 14:00.289
I won't need anything.

14:00.290 --> 14:03.792
A hippie. He's going to a love-in.

14:03.793 --> 14:05.828
I give up.

14:05.829 --> 14:07.597
One minute you're fed up.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.600
You talk about retiring
to Alaska yet!

14:10.601 --> 14:12.702
Now you've turned into
a cloak-and-dagger man.

14:12.703 --> 14:13.556
My glasses.

14:13.557 --> 14:14.705
Here they are, Dad.

14:14.706 --> 14:16.657
Can't you at least
tell me who phoned

14:16.658 --> 14:17.942
at this ungodly hour?

14:17.943 --> 14:19.689
Grandpa, there's a car,

14:19.690 --> 14:21.312
and they got guns.

14:21.313 --> 14:22.866
Do they now?

14:22.867 --> 14:25.918
Well, that's serious.

14:25.919 --> 14:26.761
I'll watch out.

14:26.762 --> 14:28.520
Honey, you've been dreaming.

14:28.521 --> 14:30.379
I wish I were!

14:34.461 --> 14:35.552
No. Uh-uh.

14:35.553 --> 14:37.730
Get someone else.

14:37.731 --> 14:41.035
Dr. Leavitt, I told you,
there's a fire!

14:41.036 --> 14:43.037
My experiment's at
the critical stage.

14:43.038 --> 14:45.255
I've been working around the clock.

14:45.256 --> 14:47.138
I can't just leave now.

14:48.377 --> 14:49.691
I want that new plate read

14:49.692 --> 14:51.179
as soon as it's developed.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.447
Yes, ma'am.

14:52.448 --> 14:54.049
My orders come from Dr. Robertson,

14:54.050 --> 14:56.252
the president's science
advisor in Washington.

14:56.253 --> 14:57.914
There's a phone. Pick it up.

14:57.915 --> 14:58.854
Call Robbie.

14:58.855 --> 15:02.056
Tell him I burnt my draft card.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.562
Are you sick, ma'am?

15:07.563 --> 15:09.566
We have a physician on call.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.568
All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest.

15:11.569 --> 15:14.005
Knock it off, Bess.

15:14.006 --> 15:16.607
If the physician certifies that
you are unable to continue...

15:16.608 --> 15:18.899
No!

15:20.679 --> 15:23.141
I'm fine.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.590
Relax.

15:30.591 --> 15:33.382
I'm going with you.

15:35.329 --> 15:38.733
Skin knife.

15:38.734 --> 15:39.793
Hold it, Mark.

15:39.794 --> 15:41.602
Sorry to disturb you.

15:41.603 --> 15:43.131
There's just been a call

15:43.132 --> 15:44.467
from a Dr. Robertson

15:44.468 --> 15:45.941
at the White House.

15:45.942 --> 15:48.510
Your orders are to break scrub.

15:48.511 --> 15:52.214
Orders? I've got a
patient all ready.

15:52.215 --> 15:54.450
Kelly will take over for you.

15:54.451 --> 15:55.316
It's all arranged.

15:55.317 --> 15:58.209
You're expected in the
surgeon's room in 30 seconds.

16:35.263 --> 16:37.999
Are you sure the satellite
isn't radioactive?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.968
No. Manchek showed me
the telemetry reports.

16:40.969 --> 16:44.573
Presumably, it could be
some form of space germ.

16:44.574 --> 16:48.811
Presumably this stuff is nonporous.

16:48.812 --> 16:50.979
Why did you pick me?

16:50.980 --> 16:53.590
You're an M.D., a talented surgeon

16:53.591 --> 16:55.885
who knows blood chemistries

16:55.886 --> 16:57.413
and you're single...

16:57.414 --> 16:59.322
the "Odd Man Hypothesis."

16:59.323 --> 17:01.392
What the hell is that?

17:01.393 --> 17:03.373
Didn't you read the
Wildfire material

17:03.374 --> 17:04.728
I've been sending you?

17:04.729 --> 17:05.406
Very little.

17:05.407 --> 17:07.998
I never went in much
for science fiction.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.063
Nor do I!

17:21.214 --> 17:22.727
It seems to me, General,

17:22.728 --> 17:24.817
Dr. Stone put one over on you.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.521
In fact, he made us all think

17:26.522 --> 17:28.280
his Wildfire Lab could handle

17:28.281 --> 17:30.324
contamination from outer space.

17:30.325 --> 17:33.460
I disagree with the
senator from Vermont.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.530
Dr. Stone, a Nobel Prize winner,

17:35.531 --> 17:38.310
twice president of the
National Academy of Sciences,

17:38.311 --> 17:40.168
is well known here in Washington.

17:40.169 --> 17:41.988
Is the implication that Dr. Stone

17:41.989 --> 17:43.439
deliberately misled us?

17:43.440 --> 17:46.876
Perhaps not deliberately, Senator.

17:46.877 --> 17:48.065
I'm reasonably certain

17:48.066 --> 17:49.241
that before the night

17:49.242 --> 17:51.248
the Wildfire Team was mobilized,

17:51.249 --> 17:53.283
Dr. Stone didn't
know Scoop existed.

17:53.284 --> 17:54.236
I'm astounded.

17:54.237 --> 17:56.453
Reasons of national security.

17:56.454 --> 17:57.192
Very smart.

17:57.193 --> 18:00.491
We've had experiences
with scientists before.

18:00.492 --> 18:03.561
Now, let's talk about
this famous letter

18:03.562 --> 18:04.850
Dr. Stone sent to the president

18:04.851 --> 18:05.796
some two years ago.

18:05.797 --> 18:07.464
From what you're saying,

18:07.465 --> 18:09.868
it was just a shot in the dark?

18:09.869 --> 18:12.471
Perhaps that's a little
unfair, Senator.

18:12.472 --> 18:14.931
Dr. Stone and I were
consultants with NASA

18:14.932 --> 18:16.609
on the Lunar Receiving Lab.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.188
He wasn't completely satisfied.

18:18.189 --> 18:20.480
He felt a more advanced
lab was required.

18:20.481 --> 18:23.383
You mean more expensive, don't you?

18:23.384 --> 18:27.988
I call that Dr. Stone's $90 million
mash note to Uncle Sam.

18:27.989 --> 18:29.768
"In a true biological crisis

18:29.769 --> 18:32.393
which our exploration of
space could bring about,

18:32.394 --> 18:34.220
the present Lunar
Receiving Laboratory

18:34.221 --> 18:35.721
might prove inadequate.

18:40.703 --> 18:41.889
I therefore urge

18:41.890 --> 18:44.407
the establishment of a facility

18:44.408 --> 18:45.417
to deal specifically

18:45.418 --> 18:47.510
with an extraterrestrial
form of life.

18:47.511 --> 18:48.738
The purpose of this facility

18:48.739 --> 18:50.626
would be to limit the dissemination

18:50.627 --> 18:52.114
of such an unknown organism

18:52.115 --> 18:53.150
from outer space

18:53.151 --> 18:54.581
and to provide laboratories

18:54.582 --> 18:55.619
for its analysis.

18:55.620 --> 18:58.122
I recommend that this
facility be located

18:58.123 --> 18:59.552
in an uninhabited region

18:59.553 --> 19:01.025
of the United States,

19:01.026 --> 19:03.428
that it utilize all known
isolation techniques,

19:03.429 --> 19:05.764
and that it be equipped
with a nuclear device

19:05.765 --> 19:07.751
for self-destruction in the event

19:07.752 --> 19:08.867
of an emergency.

19:08.868 --> 19:12.433
Yours very truly, Jeremy Stone."

19:13.840 --> 19:15.941
Don't encourage the president

19:15.942 --> 19:18.478
to think scientists are wizards.

19:18.479 --> 19:20.172
If things get out of control,

19:20.173 --> 19:21.086
and they might,

19:21.087 --> 19:23.050
even you can't work miracles.

19:23.051 --> 19:25.979
I'd expect to have
your help, Charlie.

19:35.698 --> 19:37.866
Piedmont approaching, gentlemen.

19:37.867 --> 19:40.329
Go over and give us a
look first, Dempsey.

19:59.892 --> 20:02.494
I was afraid of that.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.554
The birds'll eat the
infected flesh,

20:04.555 --> 20:07.033
and then fly off and
spread the disease.

20:07.034 --> 20:09.165
If it is a disease.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.175
Drop the gas canisters.

20:20.176 --> 20:22.717
Someone's supposed to
be alive down there!

20:22.718 --> 20:25.188
Somebody did something.

20:25.189 --> 20:27.221
That's for sure.

20:27.222 --> 20:29.650
Let's give it a double dose.

20:39.337 --> 20:43.239
That gas will only kill the birds.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.371
Okay, Dempsey, hover
over the main street

20:45.372 --> 20:46.544
and drop the ladder.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.880
Do not attempt to land.

20:47.881 --> 20:48.879
Is that clear?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.849
Roger. Clearer all the time.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.344
When we climb down,
lift off to 1,000 feet

20:54.345 --> 20:56.154
and hover at a safe distance.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.363
And come back when we signal.

20:57.364 --> 20:58.491
If anything happens to us,

20:58.492 --> 20:59.558
you have your orders.

20:59.559 --> 21:04.197
Yes, sir. Proceed directly
to Wildfire and then...

21:04.198 --> 21:05.429
If we're eliminated,

21:05.430 --> 21:06.837
the aircraft and pilot

21:06.838 --> 21:08.768
will have to be sterilized.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.770
Wait a minute!

21:10.771 --> 21:12.944
That's not what they told me.

21:12.945 --> 21:14.667
Just incinerated.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.596
Coronary?

22:07.597 --> 22:09.960
I doubt it.

22:48.481 --> 22:50.682
Hall!

22:50.683 --> 22:52.066
Take a look at this.

22:52.067 --> 22:54.587
Are you sure that isn't coronary?

22:54.588 --> 22:56.971
No, coronary's painful.

22:56.972 --> 22:58.791
They should grimace.

22:58.792 --> 23:01.094
If it was fast,
they wouldn't have time.

23:01.095 --> 23:04.523
Fast? These people were
cut down in mid-stride.

24:07.202 --> 24:09.868
Up there! Look.

24:11.373 --> 24:13.374
An Air Force jet.

24:13.375 --> 24:14.945
If we don't make it to Wildfire,

24:14.946 --> 24:16.657
he'll see the helicopter does...

24:16.658 --> 24:17.713
or shoot it down.

24:17.714 --> 24:19.055
Well, for Dempsey's sake,

24:19.056 --> 24:20.642
we better not slip up.

24:38.503 --> 24:40.505
"The Day of Judgment is at hand.

24:40.506 --> 24:41.928
Have mercy on my soul

24:41.929 --> 24:44.810
and to hell with all
the others. Amen."

24:44.811 --> 24:45.452
Senile.

24:45.453 --> 24:46.412
This took time!

24:46.413 --> 24:48.430
Regardless of what made her do it,

24:48.431 --> 24:49.515
it took time.

24:49.516 --> 24:51.977
There's a chance
someone's still alive.

24:58.159 --> 25:01.462
I wouldn't believe you could
commit suicide that way.

25:01.463 --> 25:02.829
Most of them died instantly,

25:02.830 --> 25:04.933
but a few had time
to go quietly nuts.

25:04.934 --> 25:07.998
Let's find the damn satellite.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.659
This injury, there
isn't any bleeding.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.295
A cut like this... torn veins,

25:30.296 --> 25:32.897
broken capillaries...
should bleed like hell.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.600
Yes. Well, there's no blood

25:35.601 --> 25:37.601
on any of them.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.976
Even where it's chewed,
no bleeding.

26:09.605 --> 26:12.408
Hold it, hold it!

26:12.409 --> 26:13.498
You'd better back up.

26:13.499 --> 26:15.405
We gotta go to the... left.

26:31.363 --> 26:35.724
We're damn close. Bear right.

27:01.564 --> 27:04.230
I'll bet they took
it to the doctor.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.109
There it is.

27:24.790 --> 27:27.192
The damn fool opened it!

27:27.193 --> 27:28.874
Yeah, every country doctor

27:28.875 --> 27:30.264
should run his office

27:30.265 --> 27:31.953
like the lunar lab.

27:33.232 --> 27:35.401
The capsule first, Hall.

27:35.402 --> 27:38.694
We've got about 40
minutes of oxygen left.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.558
Have a look at his buttocks.

27:56.559 --> 27:58.001
That's not funny.

27:58.002 --> 27:59.628
Not meant to be.

27:59.629 --> 28:01.273
Normally blood in a dead person

28:01.274 --> 28:02.832
goes to the lowest points.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.595
There should be marks of lividity.

28:04.596 --> 28:06.735
Do you see purplish
marks on his butt?

28:06.736 --> 28:08.971
No.

28:13.077 --> 28:16.779
Careful you don't
puncture your suit.

28:21.987 --> 28:24.389
Clotted blood!

28:24.390 --> 28:26.358
Powdered!

28:26.359 --> 28:28.493
I'll be damned!

28:28.494 --> 28:30.034
No wonder they didn't bleed.

28:30.035 --> 28:32.564
It's clotted throughout
the entire system.

28:32.565 --> 28:36.269
Five quarts of blood
turned to powder!

28:36.270 --> 28:37.398
In theory, I suppose,

28:37.399 --> 28:39.272
a single organism could do it.

28:39.273 --> 28:42.176
But, in fact, there isn't
an organism on Earth...

28:42.177 --> 28:44.911
You mean, there didn't used to be.

29:34.135 --> 29:35.402
I don't...

29:35.403 --> 29:38.235
We heard it all right.

29:41.076 --> 29:43.367
Go away! Go back!

29:46.748 --> 29:50.052
Get back! Get out of here. Go back!

29:50.053 --> 29:53.151
Get away!

30:28.028 --> 30:30.397
This must be the mother.

30:30.398 --> 30:32.799
He's scared, and hungry as hell.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.320
Can't be more than six months.

30:34.321 --> 30:36.703
There's probably a
formula in the kitchen.

30:36.704 --> 30:37.300
Don't feed it!

30:37.301 --> 30:39.107
He hasn't eaten in
at least 12 hours!

30:39.108 --> 30:39.903
We don't do anything

30:39.904 --> 30:40.771
until we get that kid

30:40.772 --> 30:42.043
into a controlled situation.

30:42.044 --> 30:44.062
Maybe feeding is part
of the disease process.

30:44.063 --> 30:46.115
Maybe those who hadn't
eaten lasted longest.

30:46.116 --> 30:48.067
Whatever it is, with
our oxygen running out,

30:48.068 --> 30:49.218
we can't take a chance.

30:49.219 --> 30:50.348
Wait a minute.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.525
This is a major break...

30:52.526 --> 30:53.722
a survivor.

30:53.723 --> 30:56.026
Too bad he can't tell
us what happened.

30:56.027 --> 30:59.956
Maybe he can... if he lives.

31:37.873 --> 31:40.539
You!

31:47.317 --> 31:49.485
You... you did it!

31:49.486 --> 31:52.621
Give me that knife.

31:52.622 --> 31:55.030
You're not human.

31:55.031 --> 31:57.794
Everybody's dead.

31:57.795 --> 31:59.515
What happened?

32:00.298 --> 32:03.033
What is it?

32:07.306 --> 32:09.734
What happened?

32:22.356 --> 32:23.893
The town is finished,

32:23.894 --> 32:25.558
contaminated beyond all...

32:25.559 --> 32:26.239
Careful, sir.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.928
This is an open transmission.

32:27.929 --> 32:29.277
I'm aware of that, Manchek.

32:29.278 --> 32:30.107
Order up a 7-12.

32:30.108 --> 32:32.032
Only the president...

32:32.033 --> 32:33.728
Precisely. Get on it.

32:33.729 --> 32:37.499
The town must be
neutralized immediately.

32:46.483 --> 32:48.798
Has the president made his decision

32:48.799 --> 32:50.453
on Directive 7-12 yet?

32:50.454 --> 32:53.056
He doesn't jump into
things, Dr. Robertson.

32:53.057 --> 32:55.659
First I've got to put together
a briefing for him.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.335
The president's main concern is

32:57.336 --> 32:59.196
the international consequences.

32:59.197 --> 33:01.266
What do you think, Mr. Secretary?

33:01.267 --> 33:03.902
It's against the
Moscow Treaty of 1963

33:03.903 --> 33:06.871
to fire thermonuclear
weapons above ground.

33:06.872 --> 33:10.051
The Russians will have
to be privately informed

33:10.052 --> 33:12.478
we're going to cauterize the area.

33:12.479 --> 33:14.545
Then they'll ask a
flock of questions.

33:14.546 --> 33:16.283
Some we don't want answered.

33:16.284 --> 33:19.019
That'll take hours.

33:19.020 --> 33:22.312
God knows how far the infection
can spread in that time.

33:28.096 --> 33:30.455
Yes, Chief?

33:31.733 --> 33:34.002
Yes, sir.

33:35.205 --> 33:37.839
Yes, Mr. President.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.639
The president's decided

33:39.640 --> 33:41.761
to postpone Directive 7-12

33:41.762 --> 33:43.546
for 24 to 48 hours.

33:43.547 --> 33:45.831
Instead he'll call
out the National Guard

33:45.832 --> 33:48.051
to cordon off the
area around Piedmont.

33:48.052 --> 33:49.567
That's your department, Ed.

33:49.568 --> 33:50.821
Safe and sound.

33:52.357 --> 33:53.817
It should've been left up

33:53.818 --> 33:55.059
to the scientists.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.127
It's a colossal mistake.

33:57.128 --> 33:59.965
Tell the president I said so.

33:59.966 --> 34:01.224
No, but...

34:01.225 --> 34:04.436
I'll get you an appointment.

34:04.437 --> 34:06.485
By whose decision, General,

34:06.486 --> 34:08.040
was the site for Wildfire chosen?

34:08.041 --> 34:09.322
Dr. Stone's.

34:09.322 --> 34:12.143
It seemed ideal because
of its remoteness.

34:12.145 --> 34:13.817
There was no inhabited area

34:13.818 --> 34:16.550
near Wildfire for a
radius of 112 miles.

34:16.551 --> 34:18.460
Las Vegas is to the north,

34:18.460 --> 34:20.080
Phoenix to the south,

34:20.081 --> 34:21.655
Los Angeles west.

34:21.656 --> 34:22.482
Weren't you worried

34:22.483 --> 34:24.158
the infection might spread to them?

34:24.159 --> 34:25.063
Yes, sir, I was,

34:25.065 --> 34:26.848
but Dr. Stone and Dr. Robertson

34:26.849 --> 34:28.563
assured the president

34:28.563 --> 34:29.755
Wildfire was foolproof

34:29.757 --> 34:30.942
because of its device

34:30.943 --> 34:32.568
for atomic self-destruct.

34:32.569 --> 34:35.360
The military had to
take a backseat.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.467
At least they could've
sent a licensed driver

34:51.467 --> 34:53.090
to meet me at that crummy airstrip.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.127
They keep personnel to a minimum

34:55.128 --> 34:56.828
for obvious reasons.

34:58.031 --> 34:58.920
You're lost!

34:58.921 --> 35:00.313
No one's been down

35:00.314 --> 35:02.501
this goat path for years.

35:02.502 --> 35:04.699
That's how it's supposed to look.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.606
They spent $50,000 on it.

35:06.607 --> 35:08.137
Putting in the potholes?

35:08.138 --> 35:10.410
Getting rid of the tread marks.

35:10.411 --> 35:13.414
Those big tractors leave
a lasting impression.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.842
A lot of heavy equipment
has passed this way.

35:23.159 --> 35:24.614
Where's our leader?

35:24.615 --> 35:28.363
We'll catch up to him
and Hall very soon now.

35:28.364 --> 35:29.842
Why'd they pick Hall?

35:29.843 --> 35:31.161
He's no scientist.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.659
Who needs an overpriced M. D?

35:35.339 --> 35:37.404
Relax and enjoy your cigarette.

35:37.405 --> 35:38.837
It's your last.

35:39.644 --> 35:42.708
It starts here.

36:01.668 --> 36:03.770
It's a great place to grow pot.

36:03.771 --> 36:05.737
Just a plain old crop of barley.

36:05.738 --> 36:08.371
Still, it is rather clever,
I think.

36:39.911 --> 36:40.838
Something wrong?

36:40.839 --> 36:42.446
I never liked red lights.

36:42.447 --> 36:45.509
Reminds me of my
years in a bordello.

36:51.023 --> 36:53.025
Howdy.

36:53.026 --> 36:55.127
Howdy-do-dee.

36:55.128 --> 36:56.675
You got the time?

36:56.676 --> 36:59.331
My watch stopped at 11:46.

36:59.332 --> 37:00.371
Darn shame.

37:00.372 --> 37:02.466
Must be the heat.

37:16.251 --> 37:18.387
It's no fake, believe me.

37:18.388 --> 37:19.391
When I retire,

37:19.392 --> 37:22.391
I'd like an agricultural
station like this in Alaska.

37:22.392 --> 37:24.079
You, a sourdough?

37:24.080 --> 37:27.163
Hmph! The sourest. This way.

37:27.164 --> 37:29.864
Step in.

37:39.578 --> 37:42.039
Cute.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.349
The whole thing,

37:47.350 --> 37:50.121
what a world we're making.

37:50.122 --> 37:52.033
I can see why the kids
are dropping out.

37:52.034 --> 37:53.092
We should've.

37:53.093 --> 37:54.649
It's an emergency, Dutton.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.195
We got tagged. Period.

37:56.196 --> 37:59.198
Until I saw those photos
from Vandenberg, I...

37:59.199 --> 38:01.365
They brought it on themselves.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.903
Who? The people in Piedmont?

38:36.241 --> 38:38.276
What you said before,

38:38.277 --> 38:40.060
you don't believe the
infection in that capsule

38:40.061 --> 38:41.580
was brought back
deliberately, do you?

38:41.581 --> 38:42.717
Skip it. I hope

38:42.718 --> 38:44.983
I'm talking through my hat.

38:44.984 --> 38:46.997
Put your hands on
that glass, palms down.

38:46.998 --> 38:49.354
It's a finger and palm
print analyzer. It...

38:49.355 --> 38:53.092
Reads a composite of 10,000
dermatographic lines.

38:53.093 --> 38:54.507
How'd you know that?

38:54.508 --> 38:57.765
Oh, Dutton, I have a
long criminal record.

38:57.766 --> 38:59.406
Then you're in trouble.

38:59.407 --> 39:02.059
This machine has a long memory.

39:03.705 --> 39:06.975
It gives you final clearance
to enter Wildfire.

39:13.516 --> 39:16.185
Isothermal
reading for M.C. Levels 4 and 5

39:16.186 --> 39:20.422
is Z.B. And R.A. Over 2.9.

39:22.326 --> 39:23.004
How's Piedmont?

39:23.005 --> 39:24.183
I had to order up a 7-12.

39:24.184 --> 39:25.195
How are you, Ruth?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.423
No other way to halt
the infection spread.

39:27.424 --> 39:27.698
Oh.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.200
Oh, you two know
each other, don't you?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.538
By reputation only.

39:31.539 --> 39:35.340
Ah, yes, up to now we've
had to worship from a far.

39:35.341 --> 39:38.201
Be good, Ruth.

39:44.618 --> 39:45.884
Any messages for me

39:45.885 --> 39:47.519
from the White House?

39:47.520 --> 39:50.056
Not a thing, Dr. Stone,
or you'd have it.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.411
No personal messages?

39:51.412 --> 39:52.258
No, ma'am.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.293
Nothing from Dr. Robertson?

39:53.294 --> 39:54.327
Are you sure, Sergeant?

39:54.328 --> 39:58.132
Dr. Stone, sir, I have
one thing to do. Just one.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.602
Everything else is fully automatic,

40:00.603 --> 40:03.137
computerized and self-regulating.

40:03.138 --> 40:06.441
I... I listen for a
little bell in here.

40:06.442 --> 40:08.061
Ding-a-ling. That means a message

40:08.062 --> 40:09.845
coming in is for the Wildfire Team.

40:09.846 --> 40:11.540
Precisely! An M.C.N. Communication.

40:11.541 --> 40:12.581
I'm expecting one.

40:12.582 --> 40:14.884
Yes, sir! Top priority.

40:14.885 --> 40:17.086
Ding-a-ling. I push a button

40:17.087 --> 40:19.363
and all five level control
centers are notified

40:19.364 --> 40:20.556
the same time you are.

40:20.557 --> 40:22.559
The bell hasn't rung, sir.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.260
Thanks for the tour, Sergeant.

40:28.266 --> 40:31.169
Dr. Dutton. Thank you.

40:31.170 --> 40:32.616
Will you follow me, Dr. Leavitt?

40:32.617 --> 40:34.406
And may I have your
glasses, please?

40:34.407 --> 40:34.860
What for?

40:34.861 --> 40:37.475
They'll be treated and
returned to you, Doctor.

40:37.476 --> 40:38.382
They better be,

40:38.383 --> 40:40.371
or I'll need a white cane.

40:41.081 --> 40:44.483
Who picked Leavitt?

40:44.484 --> 40:46.641
Talk about the Odd Man Hypothesis,

40:46.642 --> 40:48.099
which we haven't yet.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.790
She's really an oddball.

40:49.791 --> 40:51.792
We're lucky to have her.

40:51.793 --> 40:52.854
She's the best equipped of us

40:52.855 --> 40:54.429
to double up for Kirke
in microbiology.

40:54.430 --> 40:57.117
When dressed, the team will proceed

40:57.118 --> 40:59.190
directly to conference room 7.

41:10.413 --> 41:12.916
Keep this with you at all times.

41:12.917 --> 41:15.418
What's it for?

41:15.419 --> 41:16.436
You're the Odd Man.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.221
The key man, quite literally.

41:18.222 --> 41:19.660
This other key,

41:19.661 --> 41:21.623
and Wildfire itself,

41:21.624 --> 41:23.984
depend on your key.

41:43.350 --> 41:45.803
Wildfire's equipped
with a nuclear device

41:45.804 --> 41:46.987
for self-destruct.

41:46.988 --> 41:48.123
In an emergency,

41:48.124 --> 41:50.390
it's activated automatically.

41:50.391 --> 41:52.589
I've just inserted the
key in the main station

41:52.590 --> 41:53.862
that arms the mechanism.

41:53.863 --> 41:56.064
The device is ready for detonation.

41:56.065 --> 41:56.486
When?

41:56.487 --> 41:58.867
Never, we hope.

41:58.868 --> 42:00.598
It only goes off if there's danger

42:00.599 --> 42:02.605
of infection breaking
out from here.

42:02.606 --> 42:05.608
That silver key can't be removed.

42:05.609 --> 42:06.402
You're the only one

42:06.403 --> 42:07.653
who can disarm the mechanism

42:07.654 --> 42:08.811
by inserting your red key

42:08.812 --> 42:10.394
in one of the substations

42:10.395 --> 42:12.616
located throughout the facility.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.160
There's a five-minute delay

42:14.161 --> 42:16.251
between the time
detonation locks in

42:16.252 --> 42:17.721
and the bomb explodes.

42:17.722 --> 42:20.324
That gives you a chance to think

42:20.325 --> 42:22.693
and, please God, call it off.

42:22.694 --> 42:25.103
Look, I'm the new boy here. Why me?

42:25.104 --> 42:26.832
Because you're single.

42:26.833 --> 42:30.335
You should have done
your homework, sport.

42:30.336 --> 42:35.809
Page 255, Robbie's
Odd Man Hypothesis.

42:35.810 --> 42:37.578
"Results of testing confirm

42:37.579 --> 42:39.946
the Robertson Odd Man Hypothesis:

42:39.947 --> 42:42.615
That an unmarried male should
carry out command decisions

42:42.616 --> 42:45.553
involving thermonuclear
destruct contexts."

42:45.554 --> 42:48.584
Let me take a look at that.

42:55.665 --> 42:57.933
It's of vital importance

42:57.934 --> 42:59.618
that you always know where you are

42:59.619 --> 43:01.671
in relation to the
nearest substation.

43:01.672 --> 43:03.348
To do that, you have to be familiar

43:03.349 --> 43:04.740
with the entire facility.

43:04.741 --> 43:08.679
It can be studied on
this electronic diagram

43:08.680 --> 43:11.325
which rotates to afford
an overall view,

43:11.326 --> 43:13.940
or can be stopped at any section.

43:16.989 --> 43:19.714
Detailed plans of the
various levels and labs

43:19.715 --> 43:21.851
are also stored in the system.

43:25.966 --> 43:27.906
We're on level 1 of a five-story

43:27.907 --> 43:30.102
cylindrical underground structure

43:30.103 --> 43:32.571
surrounded by solid rock.

43:32.572 --> 43:34.205
Each level has three substations,

43:34.206 --> 43:36.138
indicated by the yellow lights.

43:37.912 --> 43:39.895
In the event the nuclear
device is triggered,

43:39.896 --> 43:41.482
you can still cancel self-destruct

43:41.483 --> 43:43.784
by inserting your red
key in a substation.

43:43.785 --> 43:47.088
After our last simulation run,

43:47.089 --> 43:49.350
we decided to add two
more substations per level,

43:49.351 --> 43:50.592
but they're not finished.

43:50.593 --> 43:53.595
So don't confuse them
with functioning ones.

43:53.596 --> 43:55.715
At the bottom of the central core

43:55.716 --> 43:58.391
is the apparatus for self-destruct.

44:02.740 --> 44:05.808
Each level is a different color

44:05.809 --> 44:07.054
based on a navy study

44:07.055 --> 44:08.744
of the psychological effects

44:08.745 --> 44:10.447
of color in environments.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.866
Also, each level is
biomedically cleaner

44:12.867 --> 44:14.351
than the one above it.

44:14.352 --> 44:15.655
We don't want anything

44:15.656 --> 44:17.923
to contaminate a possible organism.

44:17.924 --> 44:19.955
That would make it twice as hard

44:19.956 --> 44:22.160
to isolate and characterize.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.932
It'll take us 16 hours to descend

44:25.933 --> 44:29.269
through the programmed
decontamination procedures

44:29.270 --> 44:31.605
on the first four levels to level 5

44:31.606 --> 44:33.373
where the main labs are.

44:33.374 --> 44:35.842
Where, exactly, are we now?

44:35.843 --> 44:37.846
There's one way you can
always locate yourself

44:37.847 --> 44:38.946
or any of us instantly.

44:38.947 --> 44:40.625
Simply by calling up projections

44:40.626 --> 44:42.250
from the electronic diagram

44:42.251 --> 44:44.953
on any video monitor
anywhere in Wildfire.

44:44.954 --> 44:46.955
Views such as this.

44:46.956 --> 44:51.794
This shows we're in
conference room 7, level 1.

44:51.795 --> 44:54.596
Each of us is indicated
by our initial.

44:54.597 --> 44:56.378
Our movements are
continuously monitored

44:56.379 --> 44:57.701
on the electronic diagram.

44:57.702 --> 44:59.420
Where are the patients?

44:59.421 --> 45:01.369
Where's the capsule?

45:02.206 --> 45:04.207
The patients are the yellow X's.

45:04.208 --> 45:06.410
The red circle is the capsule.

45:06.411 --> 45:09.288
On level 5, the patients
and capsule will be isolated

45:09.289 --> 45:11.015
in biologically secure setups.

45:11.016 --> 45:12.312
Are you sure the old man

45:12.313 --> 45:14.286
and the baby are still alive?

45:29.303 --> 45:31.589
What are their chances, Hall?

45:31.590 --> 45:32.606
Uncertain.

45:32.607 --> 45:34.787
I'm hoping the intravenous dextrose

45:34.788 --> 45:36.378
and saline will hold them

45:36.379 --> 45:38.141
until we get to them.

45:38.776 --> 45:40.337
We start decontamination and

45:40.338 --> 45:42.309
immunization procedures now.

45:48.025 --> 45:51.123
You really expect me
to fire the thing?

45:52.662 --> 45:54.831
I'm afraid you don't understand.

45:54.832 --> 45:57.367
All you can do is stop it.

45:57.368 --> 45:58.874
In a biological emergency,

45:58.875 --> 46:01.238
the bomb is activated
automatically.

46:01.239 --> 46:02.863
It'll then go off
within five minutes

46:02.864 --> 46:04.342
unless you get to a substation

46:04.343 --> 46:06.907
and lock in your key.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.748
Oh.

46:13.353 --> 46:15.687
Delta Five to all levels.

46:15.688 --> 46:18.821
We are checking out ray-ban
emergency communications.

46:18.822 --> 46:20.050
This is a test.

46:36.479 --> 46:38.983
Proceed to infrared radiation

46:38.984 --> 46:41.614
decontamination room 1-D.

46:45.222 --> 46:47.306
Also it could be an organism

46:47.307 --> 46:49.892
from another planet
released deliberately.

46:49.893 --> 46:52.028
To wipe us out? Really, Charles!

46:52.029 --> 46:52.881
Just the opposite.

46:52.882 --> 46:54.231
To make friendly contact.

46:54.232 --> 46:56.173
A kind of messenger to show us

46:56.174 --> 46:58.836
life exists elsewhere
in the universe.

46:58.837 --> 47:01.087
It could be benign in
its own environment.

47:01.088 --> 47:02.607
Pretty far-fetched.

47:02.608 --> 47:05.240
We can't ignore any possibility.

47:05.553 --> 47:07.236
You are about to

47:07.237 --> 47:09.214
undergo long-wave radiation.

47:09.215 --> 47:10.575
A buzzer will sound.

47:10.576 --> 47:12.757
Close your eyes and stand still

47:12.758 --> 47:14.886
or blindness may result.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.481
We face quite a problem:

47:39.482 --> 47:40.622
How to disinfect the human body,

47:40.623 --> 47:41.586
one of the dirtiest things

47:41.587 --> 47:42.551
in the known universe.

47:42.552 --> 47:45.405
That is without killing the
human being at the same time.

47:45.406 --> 47:46.756
It gets tougher as we go.

47:46.757 --> 47:47.956
Hard on the taxpayers,

47:47.957 --> 47:49.659
the way we burn up uniforms.

47:49.660 --> 47:51.762
They're paper.

47:51.763 --> 47:53.255
I'd swear it was cloth.

47:53.256 --> 47:54.265
New process.

47:54.266 --> 47:56.019
Where's the next substation, Hall?

47:56.020 --> 47:57.668
Left of elevator on level 2.

47:57.669 --> 48:00.557
Right. Across the corridor
from body analysis,

48:00.558 --> 48:02.007
our next port of call.

48:02.008 --> 48:04.376
Not for my alabaster body.

48:04.377 --> 48:05.145
I mean it, Stone.

48:05.146 --> 48:07.703
You can take your body
analyzer and you can...

48:12.319 --> 48:15.144
Sit down, please.

48:21.095 --> 48:24.228
Please look at the screen
in front of you.

48:25.601 --> 48:27.337
Please place your body so

48:27.338 --> 48:29.997
that all points are obliterated.

48:38.315 --> 48:40.416
That is fine. We may proceed.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.766
State your name for the records.

48:42.767 --> 48:43.873
Surname first.

48:43.874 --> 48:45.121
Mark Hall.

48:47.124 --> 48:47.914
Hall, Mark.

48:47.915 --> 48:50.428
Thank you for your cooperation.

48:50.429 --> 48:52.720
Yes, dear.

48:56.635 --> 49:00.239
Please answer the
following questions yes or no.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.788
Have you any allergies?

49:01.789 --> 49:03.771
Yes, to ragweed pollen.

49:05.445 --> 49:07.447
Okay, I'll repeat for
your memory cells...

49:07.448 --> 49:09.426
Please repeat your response

49:09.427 --> 49:11.184
for our memory cells.

49:11.185 --> 49:14.352
Ragweed pollen!

49:17.158 --> 49:19.576
This ends the formal questioning.

49:19.577 --> 49:21.121
Please undress.

49:27.370 --> 49:31.071
This is a scan for fungal lesions.

49:41.185 --> 49:43.201
Dr. Stone, this is level 2 control.

49:43.202 --> 49:44.888
The answer is affirmative.

49:44.889 --> 49:47.798
Major Manchek contacted
the White House

49:47.799 --> 49:49.889
at 11:23 this morning.

49:50.929 --> 49:54.932
Contact on
all leads is "R" for ready.

49:54.933 --> 49:57.266
Do not be nervous.

49:57.267 --> 49:59.898
I'm not nervous.

50:00.707 --> 50:03.142
Physical parameters
are being measured.

50:03.143 --> 50:07.210
There's no need to be
nervous, Dr. Leavitt.

50:07.815 --> 50:12.211
Please raise your left arm.

50:19.361 --> 50:22.102
Please sit up,
facing the scan screen

50:22.103 --> 50:24.031
and watch carefully.

50:47.093 --> 50:49.567
You have received
pneumatic injections

50:49.568 --> 50:51.396
of booster immunizations.

50:51.397 --> 50:53.865
You may get dressed. Thank you.

50:53.866 --> 50:56.761
This recording is now ended.

51:02.609 --> 51:03.572
That body analyzer!

51:03.573 --> 51:06.380
I want to be there when
the A.M.A. Gets wind of it.

51:06.381 --> 51:07.763
So far it's only been used by NASA

51:07.764 --> 51:09.216
to diagnose astronauts in space.

51:09.217 --> 51:12.700
You doctors better start
making house calls again.

51:21.297 --> 51:24.233
This is a xenon lamp apparatus.

51:24.234 --> 51:26.966
To insure complete effectiveness,

51:26.967 --> 51:29.336
spread your feet apart.

51:32.243 --> 51:34.811
To protect scalp and facial hair,

51:34.812 --> 51:36.248
place the metal helmet

51:36.249 --> 51:38.048
securely on the head.

51:42.721 --> 51:45.351
Make sure the helmet
is firmly seated

51:45.352 --> 51:47.125
and the visor lowered.

51:47.126 --> 51:50.327
Then raise your arms and wait.

52:09.852 --> 52:12.712
You may now remove helmet.

52:14.356 --> 52:17.659
You will notice a fine
white ash on your body.

52:17.660 --> 52:20.716
This is the outer epithelial
layers of your skin

52:20.717 --> 52:22.762
that have been burned away.

52:24.367 --> 52:26.710
Please replace the
helmet in compartment

52:26.711 --> 52:29.272
and proceed through
shower in next room.

52:29.273 --> 52:32.508
Then you may dress
and descend to level 4.

52:39.384 --> 52:41.488
We're required to rest
for six hours on level 4

52:41.489 --> 52:43.088
after exposure to the xenon lamp.

52:43.089 --> 52:45.290
So go to your rooms and sleep.

52:45.291 --> 52:47.926
At the end of the corridor
is the cafeteria.

52:47.927 --> 52:50.643
We'll meet there at 0400 hours...

52:50.644 --> 52:51.823
tomorrow.

52:55.636 --> 52:58.404
Pharmacology to maintenance L.B.

52:58.405 --> 53:00.624
One of our R.F. S shows six points

53:00.625 --> 53:03.143
over nominal at pressure three.

53:06.915 --> 53:09.256
Watchdog to all levels.

53:09.257 --> 53:11.052
Scoop 7 capsule secure.

53:11.053 --> 53:15.414
Biocheck 66 plus 9 minus OL-5.

53:29.140 --> 53:31.441
LEO control to KEEPSAKE 5.

53:31.442 --> 53:36.848
The pressure integrity check
runs 2.54 G-CM to the second.

53:36.849 --> 53:40.118
Please confirm.

54:12.188 --> 54:15.617
A new form of life.

54:17.328 --> 54:20.196
Like Rudolph Karp's bacteria.

54:20.197 --> 54:22.098
Fools!

54:22.099 --> 54:23.727
They refuse to believe

54:23.728 --> 54:25.903
life exists in meteorites.

54:25.904 --> 54:29.807
I showed them at the Astrophysics
Conference what I just showed you.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.153
But no, even with a microscope,

54:32.154 --> 54:33.511
they are blind.

54:33.512 --> 54:34.577
What do I have to do?

54:34.578 --> 54:36.144
Hit them over the head?

54:55.069 --> 54:57.014
I'm glad you're amused, gentlemen,

54:57.015 --> 54:59.374
but it might just
turn out to be true.

54:59.375 --> 55:00.452
During this symposium,

55:00.453 --> 55:02.043
we'll discuss the possibility

55:02.044 --> 55:04.546
that intelligent life
on a distant planet

55:04.547 --> 55:06.911
may be no larger than a flea.

55:08.251 --> 55:12.248
Perhaps no larger than a bacterium.

55:15.935 --> 55:18.695
Time to wake up, sir.

55:18.696 --> 55:22.023
Time to wake up, sir!

55:26.204 --> 55:28.205
Hello?

55:28.206 --> 55:31.237
Time to wake up, sir.

55:32.378 --> 55:33.852
Who are you?

55:33.853 --> 55:36.978
Time to wake up, sir.

55:42.723 --> 55:45.124
Do you wish something, sir?

55:45.125 --> 55:47.194
Your name.

55:47.195 --> 55:50.130
Will that be all, sir?

55:50.131 --> 55:52.399
For the moment.

56:14.225 --> 56:16.927
This is the answering
service supervisor.

56:16.928 --> 56:18.343
We wish you would adopt

56:18.344 --> 56:20.631
a more serious attitude, Dr. Hall.

56:20.632 --> 56:23.334
Sorry. Her voice is quite luscious.

56:23.335 --> 56:26.109
The voice belongs to
Miss Gladys Stevens

56:26.110 --> 56:27.739
who is 63 years old.

56:27.740 --> 56:29.970
She lives in Omaha
and makes her living

56:29.971 --> 56:32.644
taping messages for
voice-reminder systems.

56:32.645 --> 56:35.147
Much obliged.

56:35.148 --> 56:37.429
Let's not get sidetracked
on Rudolph Karp

56:37.430 --> 56:38.985
and his meteorite theories.

56:38.986 --> 56:41.054
His technique was worthless!

56:41.055 --> 56:43.031
I still think we
should contact him.

56:43.032 --> 56:44.592
Fair enough. Where is he?

56:44.593 --> 56:45.908
Behind the Iron Curtain.

56:45.909 --> 56:48.454
He couldn't get a
research grant here.

56:51.867 --> 56:55.904
H.P. Nutrient now
available in the cafeteria

56:55.905 --> 56:59.207
for staff members
from sectors 1 through 6.

56:59.208 --> 56:59.947
Hemlock!

56:59.948 --> 57:02.512
All for you, Hippocrates.

57:02.513 --> 57:04.838
Not your own venom?

57:06.617 --> 57:09.118
Tastes like orange juice.

57:09.119 --> 57:11.288
Nutrient 42-5.

57:11.289 --> 57:13.190
Developed for the astronauts.

57:13.191 --> 57:15.993
Eight ounces satisfy all daily
nutritional requirements.

57:15.994 --> 57:17.929
Except coffee.

57:17.930 --> 57:20.398
And lipid soluble vitamins.

57:20.399 --> 57:21.888
For that we have these.

57:21.889 --> 57:23.001
Help yourself.

57:23.002 --> 57:25.403
So what's the point
of the cafeteria?

57:25.404 --> 57:27.919
Wildfire isn't always
on crash status.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.742
Maybe there's some sugar.

57:29.743 --> 57:29.991
Nope.

57:29.992 --> 57:32.845
Nothing that might provide
a bacterial growth medium.

57:32.846 --> 57:34.915
Precisely. No sugar in the gut.

57:34.916 --> 57:37.217
I'd like a cigarette right now.

57:37.218 --> 57:38.682
It's after meals you miss them.

57:38.683 --> 57:40.654
You should have no
trouble on level 5.

57:40.655 --> 57:43.024
You won't even get
this close to a meal.

57:43.025 --> 57:45.560
We'll be entirely on
high-protein nutrients.

57:45.561 --> 57:48.029
I planned our work in three stages.

57:48.030 --> 57:50.031
One: Detection.

57:50.032 --> 57:52.835
First step is to confirm
that an organism is present.

57:52.836 --> 57:54.080
Two: Characterization.

57:54.081 --> 57:56.471
How is it structured,
how does it work?

57:56.472 --> 57:59.341
Three: Control.

57:59.342 --> 58:01.878
How to contain and exterminate?

58:01.879 --> 58:04.132
Jeremy, on this matter
of extermination,

58:04.133 --> 58:05.448
we should go slowly.

58:05.449 --> 58:06.813
Without ever realizing it,

58:06.814 --> 58:09.753
we might destroy a highly
intelligent form of life.

58:09.754 --> 58:10.885
Why don't we get going?

58:10.886 --> 58:12.756
I've got two patients down there.

58:12.757 --> 58:14.163
The team has two subjects.

58:14.164 --> 58:16.220
They're not guinea pigs, Stone.

58:17.363 --> 58:21.099
You may now
proceed to level 5, gentlemen.

58:26.707 --> 58:29.630
Stop by your rooms
and insert these

58:29.631 --> 58:31.878
before taking the elevator.

58:31.879 --> 58:34.681
I have risked drowning
in that foul bath.

58:34.682 --> 58:35.708
I have been parboiled,

58:35.709 --> 58:37.109
irradiated and xenon flashed.

58:37.110 --> 58:38.485
And now you suggest I...

58:38.486 --> 58:38.936
I have to!

58:38.937 --> 58:41.389
We haven't done anything
about the G.I. Tract yet.

58:41.390 --> 58:42.624
On level 5 we must be

58:42.625 --> 58:44.921
as nearly germ free as possible.

58:46.595 --> 58:50.195
Anyone care to join me for a smoke?

58:52.102 --> 58:54.303
Watchdog to level 2, sector D.

58:54.304 --> 58:57.038
You are Red Kappa Phoenix status.

58:58.009 --> 59:00.610
Off the main
corridor on the outer rim

59:00.611 --> 59:03.327
are the living quarters,
conference room,

59:03.328 --> 59:05.949
cafeteria, bio-safety
maintenance, etc.

59:05.950 --> 59:08.052
Inside are the labs.

59:08.053 --> 59:10.421
Where is the library?

59:10.422 --> 59:11.622
No need for books.

59:11.623 --> 59:13.824
Everything's in the computer.

59:13.825 --> 59:16.428
Notice the capsule has
already been delivered

59:16.429 --> 59:19.232
by the sterile conveyor system

59:19.233 --> 59:22.234
to the main control lab here.

59:22.235 --> 59:23.496
Your patients are here

59:23.497 --> 59:25.571
in the hot room of miscellaneous.

59:25.572 --> 59:27.770
We can't have any
direct contact with them.

59:27.771 --> 59:28.441
Poor souls.

59:28.442 --> 59:31.241
Dr. Dutton and Dr. Hall are wanted

59:31.242 --> 59:33.305
in main control immediately.

59:34.849 --> 59:37.451
Hey!

59:37.452 --> 59:39.228
If the patients are sealed off,

59:39.229 --> 59:40.655
how do I get to them?

59:40.656 --> 59:42.260
Ever used a glove box?

59:42.261 --> 59:42.691
No.

59:42.692 --> 59:44.960
Wildfire's gone a step further.

59:44.961 --> 59:47.462
Whole rooms that operate
like glove boxes.

59:47.463 --> 59:49.698
You'll be working in one shortly.

01:00:00.878 --> 01:00:03.036
We have a magnetic "K" indices.

01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:05.843
Give us a code 3 when you get it.

01:00:22.003 --> 01:00:24.604
I wanted you here while we find out

01:00:24.605 --> 01:00:25.733
if there's anything still

01:00:25.734 --> 01:00:27.507
biologically active in the capsule.

01:00:27.508 --> 01:00:28.551
Suggestions?

01:00:28.552 --> 01:00:30.011
Use a buffalo.

01:00:30.012 --> 01:00:32.507
Audio.

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:55.139
Detectors "E"
through "G" correction.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.727
Negative "N" scan.

01:00:56.728 --> 01:00:59.443
Negative "N" scope in L Y-1.

01:00:59.444 --> 01:01:02.348
Affirmative. "N" indicator in MP-4.

01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:03.748
I will repeat.

01:01:03.749 --> 01:01:05.434
Negative "N" scan.

01:01:05.435 --> 01:01:08.353
Negative "N" scope in L Y-1.

01:01:08.354 --> 01:01:09.621
Affirmative.

01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:12.455
"N" indicator in MP-4.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.464
Whatever killed them at Piedmont

01:01:36.465 --> 01:01:38.620
is still there and
still as potent as ever.

01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:40.185
If potent's the word.

01:01:40.186 --> 01:01:41.824
Let's try a rhesus.

01:01:41.825 --> 01:01:44.685
Yeah. We'll want
a postmortem on it anyway.

01:01:56.007 --> 01:01:58.309
Housekeeping to level 5.

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.011
Clean sweep schedule
"B" now in effect.

01:02:01.012 --> 01:02:02.941
Germfree animal technicians,

01:02:02.942 --> 01:02:05.306
please consult schedule "A".

01:02:57.276 --> 01:02:58.457
So, okay.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:01.580
Isolate and identify.

01:03:01.581 --> 01:03:04.683
Right. You and I'll scan
the capsule, Ruth.

01:03:04.684 --> 01:03:07.191
Charlie, you work on
these in autopsy.

01:03:07.192 --> 01:03:08.944
Open the S.L., Ruth.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.059
Adjust S. Y. System

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.258
for aseptricity as follows.

01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:42.791
Points 2-A at 5.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.929
Points 9 through 12 at plus 1.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.427
Plus 3, plus 6 at minus.

01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:29.177
Run an initial vector
study, Charlie.

01:04:29.178 --> 01:04:31.845
Find out how the disease
enters the body.

01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:35.029
Charlie?

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:36.686
Yes.

01:04:36.687 --> 01:04:39.265
Yes, the vector study first,

01:04:39.266 --> 01:04:42.051
then autopsy. Incredible.

01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:47.031
Dutton, be careful.

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:49.301
Let our distinguished surgeon
handle the knife.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:52.404
Fine, but not for a while.

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:56.141
First, I'm a pediatrician
and a geriatrist.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.207
Take it easy.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:05:00.209
Charlie will have a technician.

01:05:13.224 --> 01:05:15.822
What's been done for them?

01:05:17.629 --> 01:05:19.209
Just plasma for the old man,

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.630
dextrose for the baby.

01:05:20.631 --> 01:05:22.770
Your therapy?

01:05:22.771 --> 01:05:25.269
No. Medcom's.

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.871
Do I call you Miss Medcom?

01:05:27.872 --> 01:05:29.558
If you like, Dr. Hall.

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:31.475
My name's Karen Anson.

01:05:31.476 --> 01:05:34.750
Good. I couldn't cope
with two machines.

01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:36.546
How does this work?

01:05:36.547 --> 01:05:37.453
You're lucky.

01:05:37.454 --> 01:05:40.484
Medcom's got one of
the best minds here.

01:05:40.485 --> 01:05:42.068
It's a medical data analyzer

01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:44.487
that can diagnose as
well as prescribe.

01:05:44.488 --> 01:05:47.691
It's hooked up to the
main computer on level 1.

01:05:47.692 --> 01:05:49.960
Every console and
instrument in Wildfire

01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:51.806
is plugged into the main computer

01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:53.362
on a time-sharing basis.

01:05:53.363 --> 01:05:54.484
All our key lab studies

01:05:54.485 --> 01:05:56.166
are done on automated machines.

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:58.168
I prefer the personal touch.

01:05:58.169 --> 01:06:00.993
It's hard to come
by in those suits.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:08.215
Have you worked in them?

01:06:08.216 --> 01:06:08.916
Not for real.

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:11.281
But I've been drilling
for three months.

01:06:11.282 --> 01:06:12.496
Thank God for an expert.

01:06:12.497 --> 01:06:14.284
This sort of thing's new to me.

01:06:14.285 --> 01:06:16.319
It's new to all of us.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.088
Until now, Wildfire's
been like a game.

01:06:19.089 --> 01:06:22.326
We've even had simulation
biowar games here

01:06:22.327 --> 01:06:25.094
with live subjects... volunteers.

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:29.199
I mean, I'm scared.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.001
I never believed
this could really happen.

01:06:32.002 --> 01:06:34.036
Well, it has happened.

01:06:34.037 --> 01:06:37.432
I'll need some lab tests.

01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:54.547
Use this to check off
what you want.

01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:58.660
Just touch the pen to the screen.

01:07:14.344 --> 01:07:16.117
You draw the bloods,

01:07:16.118 --> 01:07:18.546
I'll do the physicals.

01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:23.486
Use the bar.

01:07:23.487 --> 01:07:26.455
The tunnel seals off
automatically behind you.

01:07:26.456 --> 01:07:27.856
The only way you might possibly

01:07:27.857 --> 01:07:29.558
break your suit is with a scalpel,

01:07:29.559 --> 01:07:32.918
and a surgeon isn't
likely to do that.

01:07:57.586 --> 01:07:59.754
Bio-safety to S.L.

01:07:59.755 --> 01:08:01.991
An animal in airlock 0-9-5.

01:08:01.992 --> 01:08:06.193
Reconfirm red R.D.P.
Status before transfer.

01:08:46.736 --> 01:08:49.337
Second scan completed.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:51.268
Score, nothing to nothing.

01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:52.903
Go to 100 power.

01:09:06.087 --> 01:09:07.131
No, Ruth.

01:09:07.133 --> 01:09:08.957
Use only one microscanner.

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:09.993
You being paid by the hour?

01:09:09.995 --> 01:09:12.060
We could cover the capsule
in one half the time.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.392
There's less chance
of missing something

01:09:13.393 --> 01:09:14.863
when we both concentrate
on one screen.

01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:15.969
Let's go directly to the inside.

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.866
We can assume they put
the Scoop on the thing

01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:20.068
to scoop something into it.

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:22.002
They sure got what
they were looking for.

01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:24.081
We're not here to make accusations.

01:09:24.082 --> 01:09:25.673
We have a job to do

01:09:25.674 --> 01:09:27.176
purely as scientists.

01:09:27.178 --> 01:09:28.908
Maybe not so pure.

01:09:30.478 --> 01:09:33.680
Continue the scan,
Ruth, on the outside.

01:09:49.799 --> 01:09:51.401
No, don't do that.

01:09:51.402 --> 01:09:53.433
We'll use the hands.

01:09:53.434 --> 01:09:54.463
Nothing can happen, sir.

01:09:54.464 --> 01:09:55.736
I'm faster than the hands.

01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:58.097
I want you out of the hot room.

01:10:03.645 --> 01:10:06.214
B.Z. Doris to I.Z. Alice.

01:10:06.215 --> 01:10:10.751
S.D.T. Energy output
is 1.8 to 3.0 joules

01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:13.721
with rate two to
three milliradians.

01:10:13.722 --> 01:10:16.319
And we still need those blankets.

01:10:17.158 --> 01:10:17.954
No sweat, sir.

01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:19.560
Those cages are airtight.

01:10:19.561 --> 01:10:21.563
I wish you would sweat
a little more, Toby.

01:10:21.564 --> 01:10:25.032
Sweat is a safeguard against some
kinds of bacteria and carelessness.

01:10:25.033 --> 01:10:27.563
Use the hands.

01:10:54.095 --> 01:10:56.163
Wow!

01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:59.366
Transmitted by air, as we thought.

01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:02.069
Now we've got to
determine its size.

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:04.471
Could be a gas or
some kind of a virus.

01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:08.375
We'll use a hundred
angstrom filter to begin.

01:11:08.376 --> 01:11:10.768
About the size of a small virus.

01:11:28.496 --> 01:11:31.060
All systems go, sir.

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:49.057
Whatever it is,

01:11:49.058 --> 01:11:51.217
it's larger than a virus.

01:11:51.218 --> 01:11:53.220
We'll try a one micron filter.

01:11:53.221 --> 01:11:55.546
Hang in there, baby.

01:12:05.332 --> 01:12:06.556
He must be pretty big.

01:12:06.557 --> 01:12:08.467
I'm gonna get me a fly swatter.

01:12:08.468 --> 01:12:09.058
Do that.

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:11.499
Here goes with two microns.

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.851
Uh-huh.

01:12:25.852 --> 01:12:27.887
Nasty.

01:12:27.888 --> 01:12:30.532
At least we'll be able
to get a good look at it.

01:12:30.533 --> 01:12:31.557
Dutton to Stone.

01:12:31.558 --> 01:12:33.413
We've just found out its size:

01:12:33.414 --> 01:12:35.461
About two microns in diameter.

01:12:35.462 --> 01:12:37.563
Big enough to be a complete cell.

01:12:37.564 --> 01:12:38.497
Interesting.

01:12:38.498 --> 01:12:40.599
There's a good chance it's alive.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.201
Airborne transmission?

01:12:42.202 --> 01:12:44.503
Yes. What have you found?

01:12:44.504 --> 01:12:45.412
So far nothing.

01:12:45.413 --> 01:12:47.273
Our Nobel laureate here

01:12:47.274 --> 01:12:49.132
won't scan on the inside
because he says...

01:12:49.133 --> 01:12:49.909
All right, Ruth.

01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:51.802
Thanks, Charlie. Keep at it.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.415
It's pointless to go
on scanning outside.

01:12:56.416 --> 01:12:57.802
If it's two microns in diameter,

01:12:57.803 --> 01:12:59.217
it would've showed up at 440.

01:12:59.218 --> 01:13:01.988
True, but we didn't know
that before, did we?

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:04.590
We'll start with five
power on the inside.

01:13:04.591 --> 01:13:06.289
Stick to established procedure.

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.828
Establishment gonna
fall down and go boom.

01:13:08.829 --> 01:13:09.825
Switch to manual, Ruth.

01:13:09.826 --> 01:13:11.397
The interior's too irregular

01:13:11.398 --> 01:13:13.529
to probe on automatic.

01:13:39.725 --> 01:13:41.926
More light, huh?

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:27.238
Here's his blood value now.

01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:34.143
Half normal. Severely anemic.

01:14:39.686 --> 01:14:41.976
Wake up, sir.

01:14:43.823 --> 01:14:46.250
Can you hear me?

01:14:47.126 --> 01:14:49.394
What's your name?

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.443
Jackson.

01:14:55.444 --> 01:14:56.832
What?

01:14:59.605 --> 01:15:01.805
Jackson.

01:15:05.244 --> 01:15:07.705
Stay awake, Mr. Jackson.

01:15:08.414 --> 01:15:10.648
Stay awake!

01:15:21.527 --> 01:15:24.229
Tongue blade.

01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:27.531
Sixty-eight degrees on 1-4-0-7.

01:15:27.532 --> 01:15:29.794
Sixty-one on 1-2-0-3.

01:15:30.369 --> 01:15:34.438
Loss rate is minus 0-0-12.

01:15:34.439 --> 01:15:38.140
Please copy and confirm
all receiving locks.

01:15:57.996 --> 01:15:59.564
You can tell you're a bachelor.

01:15:59.565 --> 01:16:00.264
What was that?

01:16:00.265 --> 01:16:03.261
I didn't say anything.

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.871
We're doing an isotope scan.

01:16:07.872 --> 01:16:09.138
How the bugs get into the body.

01:16:09.139 --> 01:16:10.407
Thought you should watch it.

01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:11.809
I assume it was inhaled.

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:14.511
Not likely it's absorbed
through the skin.

01:16:14.512 --> 01:16:16.445
That's what we'll find out now:

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:18.304
The mechanism of death.

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:17.130
We'll look at a
replay of that at speed 6.

01:17:25.882 --> 01:17:28.185
That tells us
what we want to know, Hall.

01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:30.287
The organism is inhaled.

01:17:30.288 --> 01:17:32.655
The clotting begins in the lungs
and spreads outward.

01:17:32.656 --> 01:17:34.858
I didn't think it possible.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.354
I didn't think the total volume

01:17:36.355 --> 01:17:38.161
of blood could solidify that fast.

01:17:38.162 --> 01:17:39.420
I hoped maybe one crucial clot

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:40.460
might form in the brain,

01:17:40.461 --> 01:17:42.098
which was what made them go insane,

01:17:42.099 --> 01:17:44.368
and then the rest of the
blood clot more slowly.

01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:46.369
We'd have a chance to cure that.

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.019
Cure what?

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.871
We don't know what it is.

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:52.976
Stone and Leavitt haven't been
able to isolate the hellish thing.

01:17:52.977 --> 01:17:55.744
Of course they will in time.

01:17:58.282 --> 01:18:00.574
Of course.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.707
Hold it.

01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:41.156
At the edge of that
shadow, I think...

01:18:41.157 --> 01:18:43.585
Me too.

01:18:45.662 --> 01:18:47.763
It's an indentation.

01:18:47.764 --> 01:18:52.034
Yes, about the
size of a pencil point.

01:18:52.035 --> 01:18:54.269
Go to 40.

01:19:02.746 --> 01:19:04.945
Go to 60.

01:19:10.754 --> 01:19:13.188
Jeremy, do you think maybe...

01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:16.323
Maybe it's just a grain of sand.

01:19:18.395 --> 01:19:20.662
Go to 80.

01:19:28.704 --> 01:19:30.772
What about the bits of green?

01:19:30.773 --> 01:19:32.708
Paint.
For God's sake!

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:33.451
Pistachio ice cream!

01:19:33.452 --> 01:19:35.310
There's no basis to
assume it's anything yet.

01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:38.580
You're too good a scientist not to
be thinking the same thing I am.

01:19:38.581 --> 01:19:41.464
If this is really something new,

01:19:41.465 --> 01:19:43.685
some brand-new form of life...

01:19:43.686 --> 01:19:46.221
The best hope of cracking it
is to be grindingly thorough

01:19:46.222 --> 01:19:49.392
with the help of
computer number one.

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:52.024
Okay? Now let's get on with it.

01:20:01.837 --> 01:20:04.731
Hold it.

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:08.309
More pistachio?

01:20:09.345 --> 01:20:11.413
I count four patches.

01:20:11.414 --> 01:20:12.227
Keep going.

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:14.849
I'll computerize the coordinates.

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.641
Let's take a look
at the rock at 100.

01:20:24.326 --> 01:20:27.128
I doubt that's what
knocked the capsule off trajectory.

01:20:27.129 --> 01:20:29.530
Unless the rock was going
at tremendous speed,

01:20:29.531 --> 01:20:31.366
or unless it's terribly heavy.

01:20:31.367 --> 01:20:33.535
For Pete's sake, Ruth,
it can't be that heavy.

01:20:33.536 --> 01:20:35.570
Hall and I could lift the capsule.

01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:37.822
However, it's possible the
rock is different in space:

01:20:37.823 --> 01:20:39.240
Out there it might do anything.

01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:42.343
Maybe it has elastic properties
we don't even know yet.

01:20:42.344 --> 01:20:45.546
Let's have a look
at the green patches.

01:20:45.547 --> 01:20:48.850
They must've come off the rock,

01:20:48.851 --> 01:20:51.119
if it is rock.

01:20:53.855 --> 01:20:55.890
You know something?

01:20:55.891 --> 01:20:58.989
They do look like
spatters of paint.

01:20:59.895 --> 01:21:02.719
Let's go back to the rock
and see it at 440.

01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:13.291
If that's a meteor,

01:21:13.292 --> 01:21:15.007
it's a damn peculiar one.

01:21:16.277 --> 01:21:19.603
This left border over here,

01:21:20.883 --> 01:21:22.731
it's smooth, almost like

01:21:22.732 --> 01:21:24.685
an artificial surface.

01:21:24.686 --> 01:21:26.062
Painted, maybe.

01:21:26.063 --> 01:21:27.688
Luminous paint.

01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:29.515
If I keep watching it,

01:21:29.516 --> 01:21:31.192
I might think so.

01:21:31.193 --> 01:21:33.653
Wet paint sign and all.

01:21:36.899 --> 01:21:38.429
Jeremy?

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.258
What?

01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:44.706
Nothing.

01:21:44.707 --> 01:21:46.941
You okay?

01:21:46.942 --> 01:21:48.328
It's just my eyes are tired.

01:21:48.329 --> 01:21:50.410
We've been at it
five hours straight.

01:21:50.411 --> 01:21:52.412
We'll take a caffeine
break in a minute.

01:21:52.413 --> 01:21:54.176
First I'd like to see one of the

01:21:54.177 --> 01:21:56.513
separate patches of green at 1,000.

01:22:08.863 --> 01:22:10.448
Did you see that?

01:22:10.449 --> 01:22:11.164
I saw it.

01:22:11.165 --> 01:22:12.824
You didn't change the lighting?

01:22:12.825 --> 01:22:14.195
I didn't touch it.

01:22:16.938 --> 01:22:18.895
Looks alive.

01:22:18.896 --> 01:22:19.473
Yes.

01:22:19.474 --> 01:22:21.441
It's bigger than two microns.

01:22:21.442 --> 01:22:23.554
Which means the infection is spread

01:22:23.555 --> 01:22:25.679
by a mere fraction of the green.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.548
I'm bringing down cameras.

01:22:27.549 --> 01:22:29.783
Let's have the other microscanner.

01:22:35.156 --> 01:22:36.597
Stone to Level Control.

01:22:36.598 --> 01:22:37.593
I need a Mic-T.

01:22:37.594 --> 01:22:39.153
Roger. Will send.

01:22:40.995 --> 01:22:43.764
Jump it up to 1500.

01:22:43.765 --> 01:22:45.999
Microscan doesn't go any higher.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.155
We can get 1500 light

01:22:47.156 --> 01:22:49.102
magnification in microchemistry.

01:22:49.103 --> 01:22:51.427
I'll send the rock through.

01:22:53.474 --> 01:22:56.510
Attention
C.L.T. S on levels 4 and 5.

01:22:56.511 --> 01:22:58.912
Main computer shows capacity

01:22:58.913 --> 01:23:01.014
versus access time

01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:03.584
at ten to the twelfth bits.

01:23:03.585 --> 01:23:06.185
For any change in
memory configuration,

01:23:06.186 --> 01:23:10.048
C.L.T.S must check
their unicom op.

01:23:58.239 --> 01:24:00.239
Beautiful, sir.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:00.863
I'm the Mic-T.

01:24:00.864 --> 01:24:02.441
You're real sharp on the hands.

01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:05.144
Thanks. Nice to know one
hasn't lost one's touch.

01:24:05.145 --> 01:24:06.230
The next step is to find out

01:24:06.231 --> 01:24:07.146
what makes it grow.

01:24:07.147 --> 01:24:08.375
We'll need samples from the scoop

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.383
to send through maxcult
for culture and isolation.

01:24:10.384 --> 01:24:12.879
Roger, sir. In work.

01:24:16.256 --> 01:24:19.116
Good God!

01:24:37.277 --> 01:24:40.068
It's growing.

01:24:55.695 --> 01:24:57.697
Not so good.

01:24:57.698 --> 01:24:59.130
Naturally he has acidosis.

01:24:59.131 --> 01:25:01.599
His blood pH was nine
points off normal.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.353
But why? Stupid machine!

01:25:03.354 --> 01:25:05.838
What makes his blood too acid?

01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:08.403
Ask the patient.

01:25:23.523 --> 01:25:27.225
Bio-safety to S.L.,
sectors 3 and 6.

01:25:27.226 --> 01:25:29.892
Give us a code 3 when you get it.

01:25:36.335 --> 01:25:38.570
Mr. Jackson?

01:25:42.775 --> 01:25:44.759
Now, don't be scared.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.476
I'm a doctor.

01:25:48.848 --> 01:25:51.048
Bull.

01:25:52.551 --> 01:25:54.352
Where am I?

01:25:54.353 --> 01:25:57.255
A special laboratory in Nevada.

01:25:57.256 --> 01:25:59.545
We brought you here from Piedmont.

01:25:59.546 --> 01:26:00.787
You're sick.

01:26:02.361 --> 01:26:05.063
It's this damn stomach of mine.

01:26:05.064 --> 01:26:05.982
Bleeding?

01:26:05.983 --> 01:26:08.399
Hell, yes, bleeding!

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.771
Bleeding in your stomach?

01:26:09.772 --> 01:26:10.902
You have an ulcer?

01:26:10.903 --> 01:26:14.773
Damn tooting. Two years.

01:26:14.774 --> 01:26:16.027
But you must have pain.

01:26:16.028 --> 01:26:17.634
What do you do for it?

01:26:19.779 --> 01:26:22.680
Aspirin...

01:26:22.681 --> 01:26:24.783
and squeeze.

01:26:24.784 --> 01:26:26.836
Squeeze? What's that?

01:26:26.837 --> 01:26:29.384
Ain't gonna tell you.

01:26:44.904 --> 01:26:48.706
So you're a Sterno drinker, huh?

01:26:48.707 --> 01:26:50.906
Works good.

01:26:56.315 --> 01:26:59.242
Give him squeeze.

01:27:07.225 --> 01:27:09.925
What's the baby's name,
Mr. Jackson?

01:27:10.529 --> 01:27:12.598
You the nurse?

01:27:12.599 --> 01:27:14.320
Uh-huh.

01:27:15.867 --> 01:27:18.236
Shoot!

01:27:18.237 --> 01:27:20.471
Can't see your legs.

01:27:24.275 --> 01:27:26.771
Do you know the baby's name?

01:27:27.947 --> 01:27:29.980
Give us a butt first.

01:27:29.981 --> 01:27:32.272
Smoking isn't allowed here.

01:27:33.585 --> 01:27:36.047
Then go fish.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.322
Yeah.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:44.062
When you're finished,

01:27:44.063 --> 01:27:45.462
we'll transfuse Jackson

01:27:45.463 --> 01:27:47.297
and start ice water lavage.

01:27:47.298 --> 01:27:48.708
He has a two-year history

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:49.967
of bleeding ulcers.

01:27:49.968 --> 01:27:51.143
You seem delighted.

01:27:51.144 --> 01:27:53.669
It may be the reason he survived.

01:27:54.906 --> 01:27:57.875
If only our young gourmet
weren't so normal.

01:27:57.876 --> 01:28:00.777
Well, let's hope
nothing changes that.

01:28:00.778 --> 01:28:03.239
We might have to
before this is over.

01:28:39.349 --> 01:28:41.852
They should've dropped the bomb.

01:28:41.853 --> 01:28:43.571
They should've dropped it

01:28:43.572 --> 01:28:45.322
two days ago, General.

01:28:45.323 --> 01:28:47.090
This Phantom crashed
a good 60 miles

01:28:47.091 --> 01:28:48.524
beyond the cordoned area.

01:28:48.525 --> 01:28:50.827
Men on the ground can't
cordon off airspace, sir.

01:28:50.828 --> 01:28:53.063
I just don't understand
why the Wildfire Team

01:28:53.064 --> 01:28:56.332
hasn't beefed about
the delay in 7-12.

01:28:56.333 --> 01:28:58.468
It's been almost 24 hours,
and not a word from them.

01:28:58.469 --> 01:29:00.319
I don't think Piedmont had anything

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.139
to do with this crash, Manchek.

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:04.674
It was a fluke.

01:29:04.675 --> 01:29:07.209
That plane was only
over the W.F. Area

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:09.479
for two minutes at 23,000 feet.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.981
It's a routine training
mission accident, I bet you.

01:29:11.982 --> 01:29:12.955
Pilot error.

01:29:12.956 --> 01:29:14.147
Let's go.

01:29:19.656 --> 01:29:21.891
Check with Wildfire
Message Center, Delta Five.

01:29:21.892 --> 01:29:23.894
Make sure everything
there is nominal.

01:29:23.895 --> 01:29:27.074
Send me word on scrambler
at Big Head crash base.

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:27.755
Okay.

01:29:34.004 --> 01:29:35.853
Checklim program completed.

01:29:35.854 --> 01:29:38.070
All circuit banks nominal.

01:29:47.384 --> 01:29:49.982
Same thing on the M.C.N.
Console, Captain.

01:29:51.688 --> 01:29:53.689
Just a minute, Dr. Robertson.

01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:55.923
You're saying Stone's
$90 million facility,

01:29:55.924 --> 01:29:57.126
which you recommended,

01:29:57.127 --> 01:29:58.151
was knocked out

01:29:58.152 --> 01:29:59.795
by a sliver of paper?

01:29:59.796 --> 01:30:02.631
You tell that to the taxpayers!

01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:04.381
These were highly-trained

01:30:04.382 --> 01:30:05.735
electronics men, Senator,

01:30:05.736 --> 01:30:07.903
looking for an electronic fault.

01:30:07.904 --> 01:30:09.868
The trouble was purely mechanical

01:30:09.869 --> 01:30:11.307
of the simplest kind.

01:30:11.308 --> 01:30:13.311
But for them,
it was like trying to see

01:30:13.312 --> 01:30:15.211
an elephant through a microscope.

01:30:15.212 --> 01:30:17.213
The sliver had peeled from the roll

01:30:17.214 --> 01:30:18.845
and wedged between the
bell and striker,

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:20.573
preventing the bell from ringing.

01:30:27.957 --> 01:30:31.727
I'm convinced we're
being held in communicado.

01:30:31.728 --> 01:30:32.719
Very flattering.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.830
We don't know much more
than when we got here.

01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:37.832
We know about Scoop now.

01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:41.270
It's possible what Scoop
found was no accident.

01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:42.803
I suspect they were looking for

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:44.539
the ultimate biological weapon.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.421
Sounds like you're getting

01:30:46.422 --> 01:30:49.245
a little paranoid
in this fun house.

01:30:49.246 --> 01:30:51.021
What does Stone think

01:30:51.022 --> 01:30:53.748
about the ultimate weapon, I mean?

01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:56.552
We've isolated the organism.

01:30:56.553 --> 01:30:58.887
It's in microchemistry.

01:30:58.888 --> 01:30:59.736
We'll show you.

01:30:59.737 --> 01:31:02.749
Watchdog to electrical support...

01:32:09.825 --> 01:32:11.659
All right, Lieutenant.

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.463
Albuquerque
Center, this is Air Force 561.

01:32:15.464 --> 01:32:16.418
Go ahead 561.

01:32:16.419 --> 01:32:18.233
My air hose is coming apart...

01:32:18.234 --> 01:32:20.235
like it's dissolving!

01:32:20.236 --> 01:32:23.232
Everything made of rubber
is coming apart!

01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:26.170
I feel funny.

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:33.447
It's a fluke,
a vibration effect maybe.

01:32:33.448 --> 01:32:35.850
Let's get up there.

01:32:35.851 --> 01:32:37.017
Has Wildfire been informed?

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.253
You mean the germ people?

01:32:38.254 --> 01:32:40.821
It went out to them on
the scrambler an hour ago.

01:32:40.822 --> 01:32:42.353
This they can't ignore.

01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:10.585
I. B. Control to cafeteria level 3.

01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:12.786
Number 4 Charlie hatch
shows condition blue.

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:15.102
Alter responsivity characteristics

01:33:15.103 --> 01:33:17.582
until you get condition green.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.799
Ready.

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:36.458
Nothing so unusual

01:33:36.459 --> 01:33:38.212
about our rock after all.

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:39.909
Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:41.950
sulfur, silicon, et cetera.

01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:45.018
Except the black rock
isn't rock at all.

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.254
It's some kind of material
similar to plastic.

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.122
How about that?

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:51.124
The green is even simpler.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:54.127
Hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen and oxygen.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:57.231
The four basic elements
of life on Earth, nothing else.

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:59.233
That's a relief.

01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:00.242
I'd have been happier

01:34:00.243 --> 01:34:02.135
if it'd turned out not to be alive.

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.587
Green stuff,

01:34:03.588 --> 01:34:06.172
you really had us
going for a while.

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:09.568
A. A. Analysis results
are ready, Dr. Dutton.

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.247
Something's wrong.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.549
It's not registering.

01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:17.451
Yes it is, sir.

01:34:17.452 --> 01:34:21.454
It's just registering
double-zero, double-zero.

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:24.316
We'll switch to
computerized analysis.

01:34:30.397 --> 01:34:32.399
No amino acids!

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.702
No proteins, no
enzymes, no nucleic acid.

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:39.205
Impossible! No organism
can maintain life without them!

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:41.475
You mean, no Earth organism.

01:34:41.476 --> 01:34:43.810
It must have evolved in
a totally different way.

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:45.069
You got it.

01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:48.315
It doesn't come from here.

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:51.218
Without chemical reactions
there can't be life,

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:52.825
yet it grows, reproduces...

01:34:52.826 --> 01:34:53.786
Wait!

01:34:53.787 --> 01:34:55.138
The infection at Piedmont

01:34:55.139 --> 01:34:56.890
has been stopped by the bomb.

01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:57.979
We're secure at Wildfire.

01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.717
We have everything we need
to achieve a breakthrough.

01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:06.033
All we have to do is attack this
problem like any other in science.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:07.132
You could spend years

01:35:07.133 --> 01:35:08.175
working on a thing like that

01:35:08.176 --> 01:35:09.435
without solving its structure.

01:35:09.436 --> 01:35:10.978
But when you do, there'll be

01:35:10.979 --> 01:35:12.237
some red faces around.

01:35:12.238 --> 01:35:14.197
It could change everything.

01:35:17.744 --> 01:35:19.645
Great.

01:35:19.646 --> 01:35:20.722
Ruth, since Kirke isn't here,

01:35:20.723 --> 01:35:22.716
you take over the growth
program in microbiology.

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:24.853
We're halfway home if we find out

01:35:24.854 --> 01:35:27.153
what will keep that from growing.

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:29.723
Charlie, you work with
me on the E.M. Hall...

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:30.923
All right.

01:35:30.924 --> 01:35:32.082
Let me get back to my patients.

01:35:32.083 --> 01:35:34.026
I'm sure they were
protected by the same thing:

01:35:34.027 --> 01:35:35.312
Some simple mechanism

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:37.163
I just don't recognize yet.

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:38.519
There's got to be something

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.833
that the old man and
baby have in common.

01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:43.034
Oh, Hall?

01:35:44.137 --> 01:35:45.259
Five minutes.

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.139
You told me before.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.883
Yes, we wouldn't want you to get

01:35:48.884 --> 01:35:51.035
too far from the substation now.

01:35:59.052 --> 01:36:02.954
Men, keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber.

01:36:02.955 --> 01:36:04.270
I'll repeat that for you.

01:36:04.271 --> 01:36:06.987
Keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber.

01:36:10.863 --> 01:36:11.717
Major!

01:36:11.718 --> 01:36:14.292
Major Manchek!

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:19.503
Take a look at that, sir.

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.720
We just found this, General.

01:36:22.721 --> 01:36:23.976
It's a human bone.

01:36:23.977 --> 01:36:26.711
Arm, I think.

01:36:26.712 --> 01:36:28.050
It looks picked clean,

01:36:28.051 --> 01:36:29.982
almost like it was polished.

01:36:29.983 --> 01:36:30.981
That's right.

01:36:30.982 --> 01:36:32.818
Well, I don't get it.

01:36:32.819 --> 01:36:34.137
There is no actual rubber

01:36:34.138 --> 01:36:35.787
on the Phantom F-4, General.

01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:38.199
It's all a synthetic plastic

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.593
compound called polycron.

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:42.767
It has some of the characteristics

01:36:42.768 --> 01:36:43.895
of human skin.

01:36:43.896 --> 01:36:45.898
What the hell is that?

01:36:45.899 --> 01:36:48.040
What's left of his oxygen mask.

01:36:48.041 --> 01:36:49.734
It's made of polycron.

01:36:49.735 --> 01:36:51.846
I'd say it was done
by a chemical reaction

01:36:51.847 --> 01:36:52.604
of some sort.

01:36:52.605 --> 01:36:54.296
Or maybe a microorganism.

01:36:54.297 --> 01:36:55.040
Meaning?

01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:56.439
Meaning there was something

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.707
in that plane that
consumes plastic.

01:37:30.142 --> 01:37:32.177
How's Maxcult coming, Ruth?

01:37:32.178 --> 01:37:35.320
Will you be finished by
the midnight conference?

01:37:35.321 --> 01:37:35.780
Easy.

01:37:35.781 --> 01:37:39.141
Good. You can give us
the results then.

01:38:42.414 --> 01:38:45.816
Feeling better, aren't
you, Mr. Jackson?

01:38:45.817 --> 01:38:48.017
Yep!

01:38:50.022 --> 01:38:52.823
Do you always have
to wear that iron suit?

01:38:52.824 --> 01:38:54.858
Yep!

01:38:54.859 --> 01:38:57.300
Maybe you'll tell us
the baby's name now,

01:38:57.301 --> 01:38:58.128
Mr. Jackson.

01:38:58.129 --> 01:39:02.366
Manuel Rios. Mex.

01:39:02.367 --> 01:39:04.668
Real little heller.

01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:07.238
Squalls morning, noon and night.

01:39:07.239 --> 01:39:08.879
Neighbors wouldn't let them

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.701
keep their windows open.

01:39:12.644 --> 01:39:15.346
Do you sleep with
your window closed?

01:39:15.347 --> 01:39:18.081
No sirree, Bob.

01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:20.350
Fresh air fiend.

01:39:23.289 --> 01:39:27.057
Tell us what happened, Mr. Jackson.

01:39:27.058 --> 01:39:29.883
I don't want to think about it.

01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:34.364
You know what people will say?

01:39:34.365 --> 01:39:35.597
Piedmont was bad.

01:39:35.598 --> 01:39:37.768
That's why it was punished.

01:39:37.769 --> 01:39:40.335
First the town went crazy

01:39:40.336 --> 01:39:42.973
and then was destroyed.

01:39:42.974 --> 01:39:44.975
You're crazy!

01:39:44.976 --> 01:39:47.242
Folks at Piedmont was good,

01:39:47.243 --> 01:39:49.279
decent, normal folks.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.592
The man we found dressed up

01:39:50.593 --> 01:39:51.911
in his doughboy's uniform,

01:39:51.912 --> 01:39:52.983
call that normal?

01:39:52.984 --> 01:39:56.419
Pete Arnold,
who worked at the store.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.805
It was the disease.

01:39:57.806 --> 01:39:59.189
How do you know?

01:39:59.190 --> 01:40:01.045
'Cause the only thing
wrong with him

01:40:01.046 --> 01:40:02.693
before that night was sugar.

01:40:02.694 --> 01:40:04.995
Diabetes? Did he take insulin?

01:40:04.996 --> 01:40:07.497
A couple of times a day.

01:40:07.498 --> 01:40:09.900
Hated the needle.

01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:12.501
I tried to talk him
into using squeeze.

01:40:12.502 --> 01:40:15.431
Insulin. If he missed his
treatment, he'd go...

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.675
Thanks, Mr. Jackson.

01:41:05.055 --> 01:41:07.482
Oh, my God!

01:41:16.667 --> 01:41:18.062
Central C.C.

01:41:18.063 --> 01:41:20.203
To big P.C. Control, all levels.

01:41:20.204 --> 01:41:22.371
Testing laser system.

01:41:22.372 --> 01:41:24.974
Please maintain random fringe drift

01:41:24.975 --> 01:41:28.438
within ten percent
of initial value.

01:41:37.821 --> 01:41:40.436
Dr. Leavitt, you have
a midnight conference.

01:41:40.437 --> 01:41:42.191
The signal has struck twice.

01:41:42.192 --> 01:41:44.492
I heard!

01:41:44.493 --> 01:41:47.228
I heard! I've been busy.

01:41:55.939 --> 01:41:57.430
The important thing is

01:41:57.431 --> 01:41:59.441
something can slow it down.

01:41:59.442 --> 01:42:02.011
I think it's some kind
of blood disorder.

01:42:02.012 --> 01:42:04.327
If the old soldier missed
his insulin treatment,

01:42:04.328 --> 01:42:05.448
he'd go into acidosis.

01:42:05.449 --> 01:42:08.216
The same as Jackson on Sterno.

01:42:08.217 --> 01:42:10.933
I'll bet Leavitt finds the
organism shows no growth

01:42:10.934 --> 01:42:12.621
on some of the blood cultures.

01:42:12.622 --> 01:42:15.657
What's wrong with the baby's blood?

01:42:15.658 --> 01:42:17.138
Nothing... so far.

01:42:17.139 --> 01:42:20.029
Then you're back where you started.

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:22.931
No. Somehow they're
all interrelated.

01:42:22.932 --> 01:42:24.889
I'll have the answer when I know

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:27.381
why a 69-year-old Sterno drinker

01:42:27.382 --> 01:42:29.645
with an ulcer is like a normal

01:42:29.646 --> 01:42:31.529
six-month-old baby.

01:42:32.842 --> 01:42:34.678
Did you get any
no-growth readouts...

01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:36.245
No, but I'm not finished yet.

01:42:36.246 --> 01:42:37.926
You told me you'd be finished.

01:42:37.927 --> 01:42:40.048
I decided to play part of it back.

01:42:40.049 --> 01:42:42.444
What for? The first
time around should be...

01:42:42.445 --> 01:42:43.552
Knock it off, Hall!

01:42:43.553 --> 01:42:46.117
Wait. Wait.

01:42:47.156 --> 01:42:49.858
We're all tired.

01:42:49.859 --> 01:42:51.761
Tired people make mistakes.

01:42:51.762 --> 01:42:53.584
They draw wrong conclusions,

01:42:53.585 --> 01:42:54.896
they drop things.

01:42:54.897 --> 01:42:57.298
That mustn't happen.

01:42:57.299 --> 01:42:59.200
Starting now,
I want the team to get

01:42:59.201 --> 01:43:01.070
six hours sleep out of every 24.

01:43:01.071 --> 01:43:03.304
Suits me.

01:43:05.007 --> 01:43:06.016
Before turning in,

01:43:06.017 --> 01:43:08.109
shouldn't we file for a code name?

01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:10.708
Yeah, good idea.

01:43:11.914 --> 01:43:14.315
Nine over 4 over 8

01:43:14.316 --> 01:43:17.385
under 167.29.

01:43:17.386 --> 01:43:19.487
Auto check in grade.

01:43:19.488 --> 01:43:21.779
Auto check in grade.

01:43:57.425 --> 01:43:58.317
Why Andromeda?

01:43:58.318 --> 01:43:59.627
Andromeda's our...

01:43:59.628 --> 01:44:01.828
Stone!

01:44:03.832 --> 01:44:06.466
"Directive 7-12 has
not been acted upon.

01:44:06.467 --> 01:44:10.238
Alternative directive
7-11 now in effect."

01:44:10.239 --> 01:44:11.487
They didn't drop the bomb!

01:44:11.488 --> 01:44:13.774
It's an M.C.N. Transmission
sent yesterday.

01:44:13.775 --> 01:44:15.668
Idiots!

01:44:20.782 --> 01:44:22.850
Put me through to Dr. Robertson.

01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:23.922
In work, sir.

01:44:23.923 --> 01:44:25.440
Burke, you didn't special alert

01:44:25.441 --> 01:44:26.788
an M.C.N. Message to us.

01:44:26.789 --> 01:44:28.358
There haven't been any, sir.

01:44:28.359 --> 01:44:29.890
The bell didn't ring...

01:44:29.891 --> 01:44:30.994
Don't argue, damn it!

01:44:30.995 --> 01:44:32.660
I've got one in my hand.

01:44:34.463 --> 01:44:37.598
Well, well. About time
we heard from you.

01:44:37.599 --> 01:44:39.006
There has been a
communications foul-up.

01:44:39.007 --> 01:44:39.800
Never mind that now.

01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:41.870
Why hasn't that bomb
been dropped on Piedmont?

01:44:41.871 --> 01:44:43.952
The decision on 7-12 isn't final.

01:44:43.953 --> 01:44:46.106
It was just postponed 48 hours.

01:44:46.107 --> 01:44:47.599
By then the disease could spread

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.977
into a worldwide epidemic.

01:44:48.978 --> 01:44:50.924
It's because of rash
statements like that

01:44:50.925 --> 01:44:52.880
the president doesn't
trust scientists.

01:44:52.881 --> 01:44:55.082
Warn the president
it may already be too late.

01:44:55.083 --> 01:44:56.153
Stay on his back, Robbie.

01:44:56.154 --> 01:44:57.886
You've got to make him call a 7-12.

01:44:57.887 --> 01:45:00.287
Can you get me another
appointment tonight, Grimes?

01:45:00.288 --> 01:45:03.190
Now let's all just keep
our heads screwed on.

01:45:03.191 --> 01:45:06.693
Any thoughts about
the Phantom crash?

01:45:06.694 --> 01:45:09.696
We sent you a couple
messages on it.

01:45:09.697 --> 01:45:13.000
A Phantom jet strayed over the
cordoned area around Piedmont.

01:45:13.001 --> 01:45:14.141
Any other information?

01:45:14.142 --> 01:45:15.535
Well, the pilot said...

01:45:15.536 --> 01:45:18.639
that all the rubber on
the plane was dissolving.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.707
His last communication
was pretty weird.

01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:21.601
Like he was crazy?

01:45:21.602 --> 01:45:23.644
He was mighty confused,
that's for sure.

01:45:23.645 --> 01:45:25.863
Robbie, it's your job
to get the president

01:45:25.864 --> 01:45:27.547
to activate a 7-12 immediately.

01:45:27.548 --> 01:45:28.830
If he doesn't, there's no guarantee

01:45:28.831 --> 01:45:29.804
anyone west of Piedmont

01:45:29.805 --> 01:45:30.951
will be alive in the morning.

01:45:30.952 --> 01:45:32.516
Simmer down, Professor.

01:45:32.517 --> 01:45:34.021
I'll wake the boss.

01:45:34.022 --> 01:45:36.456
But General Sparks says
the crash was just a fluke.

01:45:36.457 --> 01:45:37.712
Forget the crash, Robbie.

01:45:37.713 --> 01:45:39.826
Stay on that 7-12
and get back to me.

01:45:39.827 --> 01:45:42.027
We'll be working around the clock.

01:46:15.096 --> 01:46:17.106
That's a good slice.

01:46:17.107 --> 01:46:18.626
It's too thick.

01:46:23.471 --> 01:46:25.671
I'm setting it at 800 angstroms,

01:46:25.672 --> 01:46:29.636
and I'm going to a
higher magnification.

01:46:31.012 --> 01:46:32.979
Now we're getting somewhere!

01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:33.587
Yeah.

01:46:33.588 --> 01:46:34.794
But these can't be more

01:46:34.795 --> 01:46:36.772
than a few molecules in depth.

01:46:40.187 --> 01:46:42.921
That's the one, that silver one.

01:46:47.394 --> 01:46:49.895
This is a Villabach alert,
all levels.

01:46:49.896 --> 01:46:51.897
This is a Villabach alert.

01:46:51.898 --> 01:46:56.100
Electromagnetic waves are not
registering on the D.I.R.

01:47:10.751 --> 01:47:12.604
Sample in the button
and sealed, Charlie.

01:47:12.605 --> 01:47:13.918
Start the vacuum pump.

01:47:22.963 --> 01:47:25.264
Stone, can I see you?

01:47:25.265 --> 01:47:27.333
I have the results
of the growth cultures.

01:47:27.334 --> 01:47:28.634
No, we can't leave now.

01:47:28.635 --> 01:47:30.970
We have an Andromeda
cell in the E.M.

01:47:30.971 --> 01:47:34.239
Okay, Charlie, let's
put it on the screen.

01:47:42.848 --> 01:47:44.571
Let's run it through the computer

01:47:44.572 --> 01:47:46.175
for contrast expansion.

01:47:54.861 --> 01:47:55.443
Stone?

01:47:55.444 --> 01:47:57.685
What do you think?

01:48:00.067 --> 01:48:02.068
It looks like a crystal.

01:48:02.069 --> 01:48:04.801
Well, gentlemen,
there's our answer.

01:48:04.802 --> 01:48:05.670
To what?

01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:08.474
How Andromeda functions
without amino acids.

01:48:08.475 --> 01:48:10.093
Crystalline structure.

01:48:10.094 --> 01:48:10.609
Yes.

01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:13.178
I've often thought
that living matter

01:48:13.179 --> 01:48:15.780
might be based on
crystals of some kind.

01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:18.017
All these wedge-shaped
compartments,

01:48:18.018 --> 01:48:19.477
they'd serve to separate

01:48:19.478 --> 01:48:21.844
biochemical functions very well.

01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:26.782
It's dividing.

01:48:29.195 --> 01:48:31.464
In a vacuum,
bombarded by electrons?

01:48:31.465 --> 01:48:33.399
It shouldn't even be alive!

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:34.789
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:36.154
The growth program shows

01:48:36.155 --> 01:48:38.103
Andromeda can live on anything.

01:48:38.104 --> 01:48:40.505
Only gas and light affect it.

01:48:40.506 --> 01:48:43.317
You didn't get any no-growth
results on the cultures?

01:48:43.318 --> 01:48:44.242
None. Look.

01:48:48.514 --> 01:48:51.216
The poorest growth
occurs in pure oxygen

01:48:51.217 --> 01:48:53.918
incubated under infrared light.

01:48:53.919 --> 01:48:56.721
Andromeda grows best in
carbon dioxide and hydrogen

01:48:56.722 --> 01:48:58.724
incubated under X rays.

01:48:58.725 --> 01:49:00.625
No excretions.

01:49:00.626 --> 01:49:02.263
No waste of any kind.

01:49:02.264 --> 01:49:03.928
You'd expect that.

01:49:03.929 --> 01:49:07.031
Andromeda's perfect
for existence in outer space.

01:49:07.032 --> 01:49:10.301
Consumes everything,
wastes nothing.

01:49:13.839 --> 01:49:15.222
Good Lord. Stone to Delta Five.

01:49:15.223 --> 01:49:17.242
Put me through to
Robertson immediately.

01:49:17.243 --> 01:49:17.487
What?

01:49:17.488 --> 01:49:19.244
God, I hope we're not too late.

01:49:19.245 --> 01:49:19.851
Tell me.

01:49:19.852 --> 01:49:23.573
It functions like an atomic reactor.
An atomic blast could provide it

01:49:23.574 --> 01:49:24.952
with enough energy to grow

01:49:24.953 --> 01:49:26.473
into a gigantic supercolony.

01:49:26.474 --> 01:49:27.479
In one day.

01:49:29.455 --> 01:49:31.488
You can relax now.

01:49:31.489 --> 01:49:33.081
We've just left the president.

01:49:33.082 --> 01:49:34.692
He agreed to drop the bomb.

01:49:34.693 --> 01:49:36.761
No, you've got to stop 7-12
from being carried out.

01:49:36.762 --> 01:49:37.886
Now, wait a minute!

01:49:37.887 --> 01:49:39.696
We're not playing Ping-Pong.

01:49:39.697 --> 01:49:41.857
We just got through
telling the president...

01:49:41.858 --> 01:49:43.101
For God's sake, go back!

01:49:43.102 --> 01:49:45.969
It grows when exposed to X rays
or any source of energy.

01:49:45.970 --> 01:49:47.374
Tell him no nuclear device

01:49:47.375 --> 01:49:49.407
must be detonated anywhere near it.

01:49:49.408 --> 01:49:50.870
We just found out Andromeda works

01:49:50.871 --> 01:49:52.010
like a little reactor:

01:49:52.011 --> 01:49:53.709
Converts matter to energy,

01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:55.612
energy to matter directly.

01:49:55.613 --> 01:49:57.430
Then the bomb would only provide

01:49:57.431 --> 01:49:59.457
a fantastically rich growth medium.

01:49:59.458 --> 01:50:00.285
Understand?

01:50:00.286 --> 01:50:03.247
No, but I'll pass along
the recommendation.

01:50:03.469 --> 01:50:05.023
The boss will be pleased to know

01:50:05.024 --> 01:50:06.382
that he made the right decision

01:50:06.383 --> 01:50:07.725
on 7-12 in the first place.

01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:10.357
Congratulate him
on his scientific insight.

01:50:11.029 --> 01:50:13.096
And, Robbie?

01:50:13.097 --> 01:50:15.139
You'd better get the
atomic self-destruct in here

01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:16.434
disarmed as soon as possible.

01:50:16.435 --> 01:50:19.303
Right. I'll start on
the clearances now.

01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:22.096
It'll be done by morning.

01:50:23.909 --> 01:50:24.473
No, no, no.

01:50:24.474 --> 01:50:27.234
That won't work until
the damn thing's going.

01:50:52.437 --> 01:50:55.240
All the molecules
appear to be the same.

01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:55.931
Yes.

01:50:55.932 --> 01:50:58.742
Andromeda isn't composed
of different substances

01:50:58.743 --> 01:51:00.744
like a normal cell.

01:51:00.745 --> 01:51:02.980
All the subunits are the same.

01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:05.322
Damndest thing I've ever s...

01:51:05.323 --> 01:51:07.451
Boy, a single substance.

01:51:07.452 --> 01:51:09.953
Then how the hell does it operate?

01:51:09.954 --> 01:51:11.540
How does anything so simple

01:51:11.541 --> 01:51:13.257
utilize energy for growth?

01:51:13.258 --> 01:51:15.359
No way of telling
from that structure.

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.279
Yes, there is.

01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.761
With this new data,

01:51:17.762 --> 01:51:19.657
we can get a computerized version

01:51:19.658 --> 01:51:21.623
of how Andromeda functions.

01:51:29.274 --> 01:51:30.994
They're not uniform.

01:51:30.995 --> 01:51:33.101
Could be mutations.

01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:47.828
What the devil?

01:51:47.829 --> 01:51:48.892
601?

01:51:48.893 --> 01:51:50.739
The computer's overloaded!

01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:53.397
Too much data coming in too fast.

01:51:53.398 --> 01:51:56.400
Dividing and mutating
at the same time?

01:51:56.401 --> 01:51:58.601
And nothing to stop it.

01:51:58.602 --> 01:52:01.237
Normal Earth checks and
balances don't exist for it.

01:52:01.238 --> 01:52:03.288
We'd better get a biomath mapping

01:52:03.289 --> 01:52:06.134
of its new growth
potential and spread.

01:52:16.019 --> 01:52:19.323
According to this,
there'll be a supercolony

01:52:19.324 --> 01:52:21.524
of Andromeda over the
entire Southwest...

01:52:21.525 --> 01:52:26.023
Jeremy, these are
biological warfare maps.

01:52:27.865 --> 01:52:30.733
Why, yes, so they are.

01:52:30.734 --> 01:52:34.437
Oh, but simulations, Charlie.

01:52:34.438 --> 01:52:37.773
Defensive. It's just a scenario.

01:52:37.774 --> 01:52:39.301
That's not the point,

01:52:39.302 --> 01:52:40.643
for God's sake!

01:52:40.644 --> 01:52:43.280
Wildfire was built
for germ warfare!

01:52:43.281 --> 01:52:44.648
Wildfire and Scoop.

01:52:44.649 --> 01:52:46.173
And you knew, Stone.

01:52:46.174 --> 01:52:47.350
You knew it!

01:52:47.351 --> 01:52:48.232
That's not true, Ruth.

01:52:48.233 --> 01:52:50.186
I learned about Scoop
the same time you did.

01:52:50.187 --> 01:52:52.955
They already have
Andromeda programmed.

01:52:52.956 --> 01:52:54.331
The purpose of Scoop was to find

01:52:54.332 --> 01:52:56.158
new biological weapons
in outer space,

01:52:56.159 --> 01:52:58.312
and then use Wildfire
to develop them.

01:52:58.313 --> 01:52:59.061
It stinks!

01:52:59.062 --> 01:53:00.575
You're blowing your tops.

01:53:00.576 --> 01:53:01.797
We have no proof.

01:53:01.798 --> 01:53:03.366
The map!
Don't be an ass!

01:53:03.367 --> 01:53:04.776
That map only shows what Andromeda

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:06.369
could do in the hands of an enemy.

01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:09.171
Enemy? We did it to ourselves.

01:53:09.172 --> 01:53:11.172
Perhaps, but this
is hardly the time

01:53:11.173 --> 01:53:12.575
to organize a protest.

01:53:12.576 --> 01:53:15.677
Another giant leap for mankind!

01:53:15.678 --> 01:53:17.713
I wish I could believe you.

01:53:17.714 --> 01:53:19.672
Whether you do or not, the
only important thing now

01:53:19.673 --> 01:53:20.783
is to find the antidote.

01:53:20.784 --> 01:53:23.318
Let's get on with it, Charlie.

01:53:23.319 --> 01:53:25.354
Test the cultured organisms

01:53:25.355 --> 01:53:27.189
for biologic potency.

01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:28.319
All right, I'll run them

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.692
against a rat in autopsy.

01:53:29.693 --> 01:53:32.373
I want to seal up the capsule.

01:53:32.374 --> 01:53:33.429
Watch it.

01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:34.687
Andromeda's altered.

01:53:34.688 --> 01:53:37.500
Its effect might be
radically different.

01:53:37.501 --> 01:53:40.064
I'll try to get us a photo
of the mutated form.

01:53:53.116 --> 01:53:55.116
Photo lab to red map.

01:53:55.117 --> 01:54:00.617
The offbeat access reference
reads at 649-F, 1.500.

01:54:02.024 --> 01:54:04.258
Please copy.

01:54:15.739 --> 01:54:18.339
This may be the key
to beating Andromeda.

01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:21.336
How, by starving him to death?
No, but don't feed him until I tell you.

01:54:25.781 --> 01:54:28.481
Contamination!

01:54:34.156 --> 01:54:36.803
A seal has broken in autopsy.

01:54:36.804 --> 01:54:38.960
A seal has broken in autopsy.

01:54:38.961 --> 01:54:41.362
Emergency procedures are in effect.

01:54:41.363 --> 01:54:42.613
What's the matter?

01:54:42.614 --> 01:54:44.928
Infection spread. Autopsy.

01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:54.738
Is he alive?

01:54:54.739 --> 01:54:56.611
I should've been with him!
Dr. Dutton!

01:54:56.612 --> 01:54:58.812
It's no use. It's sealed off.

01:54:59.715 --> 01:55:02.279
Dr. Hall!

01:55:04.686 --> 01:55:06.621
She's in trouble.

01:55:06.622 --> 01:55:08.890
Ruth, are you...

01:55:26.308 --> 01:55:29.906
She's got the germ!

01:55:36.317 --> 01:55:38.292
Someone bring 100 milligrams

01:55:38.293 --> 01:55:40.918
of phenobarb in a syringe fast!

01:55:43.625 --> 01:55:44.749
There's no danger.

01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:46.485
She isn't contagious.

01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:51.665
There's no danger!

01:55:51.666 --> 01:55:55.537
To L-5, P. I. E. And E. T. E.

01:55:55.538 --> 01:55:58.439
Your second quarter rest
period has been canceled.

01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.141
Time R.A. Has been reassigned

01:56:01.142 --> 01:56:03.809
according to crash program "E".

01:56:04.747 --> 01:56:06.747
Come on!

01:56:06.748 --> 01:56:08.248
Come on. She can't hurt you.

01:56:08.249 --> 01:56:10.551
Wasn't she with Dr. Dutton?

01:56:10.552 --> 01:56:11.510
No, it's epilepsy.

01:56:11.511 --> 01:56:12.789
Give her the injection.

01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:14.311
She'll be all right.

01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:18.256
Good girl. Thanks.

01:56:21.063 --> 01:56:22.053
I'm scared.

01:56:22.054 --> 01:56:25.083
Oh, Lord, I'm scared.
You'll be okay, Charlie.

01:56:25.084 --> 01:56:27.000
We're pumping pure oxygen
through your lab now.

01:56:27.001 --> 01:56:29.566
We know Andromeda
doesn't do well in oxygen.

01:56:31.306 --> 01:56:31.962
He's alive!

01:56:31.963 --> 01:56:33.373
Where have you been?

01:56:33.374 --> 01:56:36.334
Leavitt had a seizure.

01:56:36.335 --> 01:56:37.377
What?

01:56:37.378 --> 01:56:38.577
Epilepsy. The red light

01:56:38.578 --> 01:56:39.857
flashing at 3 per second

01:56:39.858 --> 01:56:40.981
brought on a fit.

01:56:40.982 --> 01:56:42.983
Why in the hell didn't
she tell us about it?

01:56:42.984 --> 01:56:44.978
No top lab would have
her if they knew.

01:56:44.979 --> 01:56:46.987
Insurance, prejudice,
all that crap.

01:56:46.988 --> 01:56:48.989
From the Middle Ages.

01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:51.992
Amazing he's still alive.

01:56:51.993 --> 01:56:54.094
Well, it's been three minutes.

01:56:54.095 --> 01:56:55.373
He's on pure oxygen.

01:56:55.374 --> 01:56:58.198
I don't know how long
that can hold him.

01:56:58.199 --> 01:57:01.100
We're, working on
some ideas, Charlie.

01:57:01.101 --> 01:57:04.404
Ask your germ warfare friends.

01:57:04.405 --> 01:57:06.406
They have lots.

01:57:06.407 --> 01:57:08.608
Try to stay calm.

01:57:08.609 --> 01:57:10.611
What happened?

01:57:10.612 --> 01:57:12.913
Seal must've broken in there.

01:57:12.914 --> 01:57:15.415
They had the same thing
at the lunar lab.

01:57:15.416 --> 01:57:17.817
That's why we use
polycron gaskets here.

01:57:17.818 --> 01:57:20.519
At least the rest of
Wildfire is secure.

01:57:22.724 --> 01:57:24.724
Poor devil.

01:57:24.725 --> 01:57:26.625
Look at the way he's breathing.

01:57:26.626 --> 01:57:28.629
He's scared to death.

01:57:28.630 --> 01:57:30.717
That oxygen should relax him,

01:57:30.718 --> 01:57:32.665
slow down his breathing.

01:57:32.666 --> 01:57:34.734
No, we want him to breathe fast!

01:57:34.735 --> 01:57:36.681
In Piedmont, Jackson
was crocked on Sterno.

01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:37.537
Sterno acidosis.

01:57:37.538 --> 01:57:39.072
Acidosis: Rapid breathing.

01:57:39.073 --> 01:57:40.178
What the hell you doing?

01:57:40.179 --> 01:57:42.241
Turn off the oxygen.
Put him on room air.

01:57:42.242 --> 01:57:43.882
The baby, he's normal.
Cries all the time.

01:57:43.883 --> 01:57:45.613
Can't catch his breath.
Rapid breathing?

01:57:45.614 --> 01:57:47.346
It just can't be that simple.
It isn't.

01:57:47.347 --> 01:57:50.583
Dutton, I think rapid
breathing helps.

01:57:50.584 --> 01:57:52.580
Don't let the bug in
your lungs long enough

01:57:52.581 --> 01:57:53.954
to penetrate blood vessels.

01:57:53.955 --> 01:57:55.689
I want to turn off the pure oxygen,

01:57:55.690 --> 01:57:58.491
then you start breathing
room air as fast as you can.

01:57:58.492 --> 01:57:59.100
No! No.

01:57:59.101 --> 01:58:01.862
I was running a test in here.

01:58:01.863 --> 01:58:03.513
The air is thick with Andromeda.

01:58:03.514 --> 01:58:05.698
Experiment with your
own life, damn it!

01:58:05.699 --> 01:58:06.982
We won't do it, Charlie.
Take it easy.

01:58:06.983 --> 01:58:07.767
I know I'm close.

01:58:07.768 --> 01:58:09.319
I'm sure it has something to do

01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.108
with blood chemistry and breathing.

01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:13.500
Dr. Hall. May I please
feed the baby now?

01:58:13.501 --> 01:58:15.274
He's been crying steadily...

01:58:15.275 --> 01:58:17.711
That's what I want.
Keep him crying.

01:58:17.712 --> 01:58:19.122
Run another blood value on him.

01:58:19.123 --> 01:58:20.379
Get his pH measurements.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.386
Yes, Doctor!

01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:24.704
With all the yelling,

01:58:24.705 --> 01:58:26.191
blowing off carbon dioxide,

01:58:26.192 --> 01:58:28.387
the kid should have
too little acid.

01:58:28.388 --> 01:58:30.120
Alkaline: A blood condition just

01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:31.777
the opposite from the old man.

01:58:31.778 --> 01:58:32.892
Too much alkali.

01:58:32.893 --> 01:58:35.795
Well, what good does
that do Dutton?

01:58:35.796 --> 01:58:37.830
Karen, where's the blood test?

01:58:37.831 --> 01:58:41.834
It's coming through
now on your console.

01:58:41.835 --> 01:58:44.501
Hell of a way to run a hospital.

01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:49.341
Just what you expected.

01:58:49.342 --> 01:58:50.474
Opposite blood chemistries,

01:58:50.475 --> 01:58:51.711
the baby and the old man.

01:58:51.712 --> 01:58:53.913
One of them should
be a dead opposite...

01:58:53.914 --> 01:58:54.714
But he's not.

01:58:54.715 --> 01:58:57.210
There must be a connection!

01:58:58.418 --> 01:58:59.972
They both stayed alive at Piedmont

01:58:59.973 --> 01:59:01.220
breathing the same air.

01:59:01.221 --> 01:59:02.967
One's blood too alkaline,

01:59:02.968 --> 01:59:05.013
the other too... acid.

01:59:08.929 --> 01:59:12.392
Yes. Yes!

01:59:14.467 --> 01:59:16.189
Dutton, I'm turning off the oxygen.

01:59:16.190 --> 01:59:17.436
Breathe fast and hard.

01:59:17.437 --> 01:59:18.011
No, Jeremy!

01:59:18.012 --> 01:59:19.939
Don't let him cut off my oxygen.

01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:22.387
No! The air in that
room is loaded...

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:23.776
Air doesn't matter.

01:59:23.777 --> 01:59:27.046
Blood does. That's the answer.

01:59:34.354 --> 01:59:37.288
I need 30 seconds
to run a growth program.

01:59:37.289 --> 01:59:39.290
He could die in 30 seconds.

01:59:39.291 --> 01:59:41.393
Besides, Leavitt checked
all the growth programs.

01:59:41.394 --> 01:59:43.562
She might have missed something.
Epileptics blank out.

01:59:43.563 --> 01:59:45.536
I want to see how the
growth of Andromeda

01:59:45.537 --> 01:59:47.665
is affected by blood
chemistry. The pH...

01:59:47.666 --> 01:59:50.435
Oh, damn!

01:59:52.204 --> 01:59:54.472
You do it.

02:00:10.422 --> 02:00:11.267
Excellent.

02:00:11.268 --> 02:00:13.726
The graph's practically
straight up and down.

02:00:13.727 --> 02:00:15.392
That means Andromeda can only exist

02:00:15.393 --> 02:00:16.895
within a narrow range of pH.

02:00:16.896 --> 02:00:18.930
A very narrow range.

02:00:18.931 --> 02:00:21.199
On either side of the
tolerance range, no growth.

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.156
Nothing, right?

02:00:22.157 --> 02:00:23.730
It's exterminated.

02:00:25.805 --> 02:00:27.312
Dutton, our troubles are over.

02:00:27.313 --> 02:00:28.540
Look at your console.

02:00:28.541 --> 02:00:30.665
It grows within
a narrow range of pH.

02:00:30.666 --> 02:00:32.110
A very narrow range.

02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:35.713
If your blood's abnormal,
if it's too acid or alkaline,

02:00:35.714 --> 02:00:38.449
Andromeda can't survive
in the body.

02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:40.222
So breathe as fast as you can.

02:00:40.223 --> 02:00:42.413
Go into respiratory alkalosis.

02:00:47.059 --> 02:00:47.700
Yes, fine.

02:00:47.701 --> 02:00:50.662
That'll shoot your
blood chemistry to hell.

02:00:50.663 --> 02:00:51.962
It's what happens to the baby

02:00:51.963 --> 02:00:53.034
when he cries too much,

02:00:53.035 --> 02:00:54.591
or the old man on Sterno.

02:00:55.734 --> 02:00:57.644
How do you feel?

02:00:57.645 --> 02:00:58.336
Okay.

02:00:58.337 --> 02:01:00.738
A little dizzy, but okay.

02:01:00.739 --> 02:01:02.940
He can't keep breathing
like that forever.

02:01:02.941 --> 02:01:04.008
He'll hyperventilate, pass out.

02:01:04.009 --> 02:01:06.044
We've got to get him something
to alkalize his blood.

02:01:06.045 --> 02:01:08.746
We can't in there.

02:01:08.747 --> 02:01:10.747
Charlie!

02:01:10.748 --> 02:01:14.853
That cage... in the hot room.

02:01:14.854 --> 02:01:17.281
Right in front of you.

02:01:18.056 --> 02:01:20.058
It's alive!

02:01:20.059 --> 02:01:22.660
The rat's been exposed
as long as I have.

02:01:22.661 --> 02:01:24.558
Longer. I exposed
it to the cultures

02:01:24.559 --> 02:01:25.896
before the seal broke.

02:01:25.897 --> 02:01:26.628
Precisely.

02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:30.362
Andromeda's mutated
to a noninfectious form.

02:01:34.873 --> 02:01:37.472
Holy!

02:01:40.979 --> 02:01:42.453
Where does that gasket lead?

02:01:42.454 --> 02:01:43.313
Central core.

02:01:43.314 --> 02:01:45.583
It connects all the labs.

02:01:49.487 --> 02:01:51.476
The gaskets are decomposing.

02:01:51.477 --> 02:01:52.984
It's Andromeda.

02:01:59.397 --> 02:02:00.003
Next sector.

02:02:00.004 --> 02:02:02.326
There's no substation
in this sector.

02:02:14.712 --> 02:02:16.624
Level 5 is sealed.

02:02:16.625 --> 02:02:18.015
Level 5 is sealed.

02:02:18.016 --> 02:02:20.117
Emergency procedures are in effect.

02:02:20.118 --> 02:02:21.318
When the bomb goes off,

02:02:21.319 --> 02:02:23.220
there'll be a thousand mutations.

02:02:23.221 --> 02:02:24.547
Andromeda will spread everywhere.

02:02:24.548 --> 02:02:25.822
They'll never be rid of it.

02:02:25.823 --> 02:02:30.219
There are now five
minutes to self-destruct.

02:02:31.029 --> 02:02:33.463
What about the other levels?

02:02:33.464 --> 02:02:35.137
Can't tell. Each sector seals off

02:02:35.138 --> 02:02:36.330
when it's contaminated,

02:02:36.331 --> 02:02:37.666
even the elevator.

02:02:39.871 --> 02:02:42.139
The defense system is perfect.

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:45.102
It'll even bury our mistakes.

02:02:46.077 --> 02:02:48.504
What about the central core?

02:02:51.248 --> 02:02:52.921
The core's equipped
with safeguards.

02:02:52.922 --> 02:02:53.550
Like what?

02:02:53.551 --> 02:02:54.550
Gas, lasers,

02:02:54.551 --> 02:02:56.353
to prevent escape of lab animals.

02:02:56.354 --> 02:02:57.547
What would my chances be?

02:02:57.548 --> 02:03:00.190
They don't exist for anyone
anywhere if you stay here.

02:03:00.191 --> 02:03:01.676
How do I get into the core?

02:03:01.677 --> 02:03:03.293
Through that service port.

02:03:03.294 --> 02:03:03.978
Go ahead.

02:03:03.979 --> 02:03:07.396
I'll ride shotgun for
you in main control.

02:03:07.397 --> 02:03:09.499
I can't monitor the lasers here.

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:11.501
Karen, get me a scalpel.

02:03:11.502 --> 02:03:14.104
There are now four minutes

02:03:14.105 --> 02:03:16.795
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

02:03:20.078 --> 02:03:21.317
Cut it off!

02:03:21.318 --> 02:03:23.869
Cut the panel off.

02:03:25.984 --> 02:03:28.878
Karen, cut it!

02:03:30.087 --> 02:03:32.719
Come on. Hurry up.

02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:46.961
Hey, Doc, you ain't leaving
us here, are you?

02:03:48.605 --> 02:03:51.408
The lasers are tuned low
for small animals, Mark.

02:03:51.409 --> 02:03:54.510
You can make it if you're not
hit along the spinal cord.

02:03:54.511 --> 02:03:59.215
There are now
four minutes to self-destruct.

02:04:12.029 --> 02:04:14.354
That's the ladder across from you.

02:04:14.355 --> 02:04:16.061
Go before the gas starts.

02:04:24.474 --> 02:04:29.587
There are now three minutes
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

02:04:29.588 --> 02:04:31.936
That's the gas. Keep going.

02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:36.959
The sensors have picked you up.

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.143
Get moving.

02:04:40.857 --> 02:04:43.259
Duck!

02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:46.162
Keep going.

02:04:46.163 --> 02:04:48.063
Duck!

02:04:48.064 --> 02:04:50.299
Keep going.

02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.363
Duck!

02:04:53.804 --> 02:04:58.063
There are now
three minutes to self-destruct.

02:04:59.576 --> 02:05:02.411
No, it's no good.

02:05:02.412 --> 02:05:03.441
The level's contaminated.

02:05:03.442 --> 02:05:04.579
You'll have to go to 3.

02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:06.782
Go to 3!

02:05:06.783 --> 02:05:12.287
There are now two minutes
and 45 seconds to self-destruct.

02:05:12.288 --> 02:05:15.490
Sway! Weave!

02:05:16.827 --> 02:05:20.728
You're zeroed in. Duck!

02:05:20.729 --> 02:05:22.953
There are now two minutes

02:05:22.954 --> 02:05:26.301
and 30 seconds to self-destruct.

02:05:26.302 --> 02:05:29.503
Keep going! You'll make it.

02:05:35.845 --> 02:05:41.516
There are now two minutes
and 15 seconds to self-destruct.

02:05:43.719 --> 02:05:46.681
Fight the effect.
It's mostly shock.

02:05:50.626 --> 02:05:53.101
You've lost some time,
but you can still do it.

02:05:53.102 --> 02:05:53.928
See the door?

02:05:53.929 --> 02:05:58.529
There are now two
minutes to self-destruct.

02:06:07.776 --> 02:06:15.110
There is now one minute and
45 seconds to self-destruct.

02:06:20.090 --> 02:06:26.250
There is now one minute and
30 seconds to self-destruct.

02:06:32.268 --> 02:06:33.085
There is now...

02:06:33.086 --> 02:06:34.302
You're in an airlock.

02:06:34.303 --> 02:06:35.059
Turn the wheel.

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:37.405
One minute and 15
seconds to self-destruct.

02:06:37.406 --> 02:06:38.883
No, not that one.

02:06:38.884 --> 02:06:41.267
The one near the door.

02:06:47.082 --> 02:06:50.977
There are now
60 seconds to self-destruct.

02:06:54.924 --> 02:06:59.217
There are now 55 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:02.097 --> 02:07:06.299
There are now 50 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:07.702 --> 02:07:08.706
Where is it?

02:07:08.707 --> 02:07:11.811
There are now 45 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:11.812 --> 02:07:13.041
Come on. Where is it?

02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:15.209
Help me!

02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:20.608
There are now 40 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:23.051 --> 02:07:28.016
There are now 35 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:30.325 --> 02:07:35.187
There are now 30 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:37.533 --> 02:07:42.098
There are now 25 seconds
to self-destruct.

02:07:43.672 --> 02:07:46.012
Twenty seconds,

02:07:46.013 --> 02:07:48.075
19, 18, 17,

02:07:48.076 --> 02:07:50.244
16, 15,

02:07:50.245 --> 02:07:53.348
14, 13, 12,

02:07:53.349 --> 02:07:56.483
11, 10, 9...

02:07:56.484 --> 02:07:59.082
Self-destruct has been canceled.

02:08:08.196 --> 02:08:10.464
Congratulations.

02:08:11.766 --> 02:08:14.001
I take it the bomb didn't...

02:08:14.002 --> 02:08:16.270
No, it didn't.

02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:17.818
Eight seconds to spare.

02:08:17.819 --> 02:08:19.665
Hardly even exciting.

02:08:20.475 --> 02:08:22.509
What's happening?

02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:25.579
The supercolony's now off the coast

02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:27.781
and moving southwest
across the Pacific.

02:08:27.782 --> 02:08:29.883
Apparently Andromeda
hasn't turned lethal again.

02:08:29.884 --> 02:08:31.148
At least there haven't been

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:32.718
any reports of bizarre deaths.

02:08:32.719 --> 02:08:34.024
We're applying an adaptation

02:08:34.025 --> 02:08:35.289
of your antidote to it.

02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:36.015
Cloud seeding.

02:08:36.016 --> 02:08:38.225
We're seeding the
clouds above Andromeda

02:08:38.226 --> 02:08:40.226
with silver iodide.

02:08:40.227 --> 02:08:41.471
The raindrops will carry the

02:08:41.472 --> 02:08:42.696
organism into the ocean,

02:08:42.697 --> 02:08:43.916
and the alkaline reaction

02:08:43.917 --> 02:08:45.499
from seawater should kill it.

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:47.395
Just as acids or alkali

02:08:47.396 --> 02:08:49.235
in the blood stopped it.

02:08:51.005 --> 02:08:53.148
This cloud seeding business,

02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:54.608
you absolutely sure it worked?

02:08:54.609 --> 02:08:55.392
You better be.

02:08:55.393 --> 02:08:56.986
All reports indicate

02:08:56.987 --> 02:08:58.912
the experiment was successful.

02:08:58.913 --> 02:09:01.297
Then we can feel confident

02:09:01.298 --> 02:09:03.549
your so-called
biological crisis is over?

02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:05.251
As far as Andromeda's
concerned, yes.

02:09:05.252 --> 02:09:06.696
We have the organism at Wildfire

02:09:06.697 --> 02:09:08.121
and we continue to study it.

02:09:08.122 --> 02:09:09.589
We now know beyond a doubt

02:09:09.590 --> 02:09:10.972
that other forms of life

02:09:10.973 --> 02:09:12.425
exist in the universe.

02:09:12.426 --> 02:09:15.612
Thanks to Scoop.

02:09:15.613 --> 02:09:16.229
Yes.

02:09:16.230 --> 02:09:18.127
However, with this new knowledge,

02:09:18.128 --> 02:09:19.465
there's no guarantee

02:09:19.466 --> 02:09:22.171
that another so-called
biological crisis
