00:30.567 --> 00:34.200
* So come with me,
we'll all go and see

00:34.200 --> 00:37.867
* The Big Rock Candy Mountains

00:37.867 --> 00:41.833
* Yes, the Big Rock
Candy Mountains

00:41.833 --> 00:45.733
* There's a land
that's fair and bright

00:45.733 --> 00:49.367
* Where the handouts
grow on bushes

00:49.367 --> 00:52.833
* And you sleep
out every night *

00:52.833 --> 00:57.733
(Phone ringing)

01:10.467 --> 01:11.833
Hello?

01:12.367 --> 01:13.767
[Voiceover] Where
have you been?

01:14.367 --> 01:18.067
Oh just, just had to work
on the will, what's up?

01:18.067 --> 01:19.967
[Voiceover] What's up,
our little brother is

01:19.967 --> 01:21.333
Still missing.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.533
Well I mean you
left him there.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.633
[Voiceover] I'm not
making any of this up.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.533
Oh God, why won't
you believe me?

01:29.533 --> 01:31.467
Well, they're
saying it's a virus.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.733
You sure you and Sam
didn't just hallucinate

01:33.733 --> 01:35.400
All this ghost stuff
when you were there?

01:35.400 --> 01:37.867
[Voiceover] So,
what, did I hallucinate

01:37.867 --> 01:41.267
My broken leg and the
claw marks on my back too?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.500
No come, that's not
what I'm saying, okay,

01:43.500 --> 01:45.133
I'm just saying that
sounds an awful lot

01:45.133 --> 01:48.167
Like Sam's big imagination
going into overdrive here.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.500
[Voiceover] Because
having an imagination

01:49.500 --> 01:52.300
Is just such a
terrible thing, Dad.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.800
All right come on,
look, after all this shit

01:54.800 --> 01:57.133
I've been going
through, with the will,

01:57.133 --> 02:00.067
You really think that I
still regret Dad's death?

02:00.067 --> 02:02.367
The only thing I regret
about our parents dying

02:02.367 --> 02:03.900
Is that I didn't get to
tell Dad to go F himself

02:03.900 --> 02:05.500
Before he died.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.767
Okay now, I will go to
Tasmania and I will bring

02:07.767 --> 02:10.366
Our little brother
home, you understand me?

02:10.366 --> 02:11.567
[Voiceover] Fine.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.067
Just bring him home.

02:13.067 --> 02:13.967
Fine.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.967
(Anticipating music)

02:21.967 --> 02:24.067
[Voiceover] Why isn't the
government talking about it?

02:24.067 --> 02:26.233
We know Tasmania is
quarantined, sure but,

02:26.233 --> 02:27.633
What is being quarantined?

02:27.633 --> 02:29.300
What if it is all
just a cover up?

02:29.300 --> 02:31.667
Or worse, what if we're
dealing with something

02:31.667 --> 02:34.167
The military doesn't
even understand?

02:34.167 --> 02:36.767
[Voiceover] Oh come on,
the entire state of Tasmania

02:36.767 --> 02:39.467
Evacuated for what, testing?

02:39.467 --> 02:41.067
People have died.

02:41.067 --> 02:42.467
(Sad music)

02:42.467 --> 02:44.767
[Voiceover] Nah but,
people have gone missing.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.367
Have you seen any
bodies, I don't know.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.267
Now maybe they found
something, I'm telling you,

02:48.267 --> 02:51.100
Maybe we're dealing with an
enemy here that can't be seen.

02:51.100 --> 02:55.233
(Sad music)

03:06.200 --> 03:08.067
[Voiceover] You see,
this is exactly the sort of

03:08.067 --> 03:09.933
Conspiracy that brought
these people to doing

03:09.933 --> 03:11.967
Wretched and horrible things.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.633
It's this nonsense
that gets people killed

03:14.633 --> 03:16.233
On a grand scale.

03:17.433 --> 03:20.067
[Voiceover] Tell
the (mumbling), it's
been (mumbling),

03:20.067 --> 03:24.967
Like days, and we haven't
heard a thing, (mumbling).

03:24.967 --> 03:29.667
(Sad music)

03:41.567 --> 03:45.367
An entire state is empty.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.800
When is someone gonna
tell us the truth?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.300
[Voiceover] And
what is the truth?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.900
Aliens, secret testing?

03:51.900 --> 03:54.767
[Voiceover] See that's just
it, it could be anything.

03:54.767 --> 03:59.133
(Sad music)

04:07.200 --> 04:09.167
There's a lot of people like
you, turning the other way,

04:09.167 --> 04:10.433
And pretend like
nothing is happening,

04:10.433 --> 04:12.533
That nothing is
wrong, (mumbling)

04:12.533 --> 04:16.632
May be on a path to extinction
if this is left unchecked.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.600
[Voiceover]
Extinction, please.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.567
The military says
there's a virus,

04:20.567 --> 04:22.067
And they're containing it.

04:22.067 --> 04:25.867
That is enough for me, I'm
well, my family is well,

04:25.867 --> 04:27.767
I have no interest in digging
up something that could

04:27.767 --> 04:30.967
Cost me or any other fellow
Australians their lives.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.767
I say this is the military's
problem, let the military

04:33.767 --> 04:35.167
Handle it, okay?

04:48.667 --> 04:53.567
(Sad music)

05:04.333 --> 05:07.767
[Voiceover] Hey
Sam, It's Molly.

05:08.900 --> 05:12.167
My friend and I are here,
we're at your cabin.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.933
It doesn't look like
you've been here for weeks.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.833
Oh God where are you?

05:19.933 --> 05:22.100
Look, I'm sorry to
just show up like this,

05:22.100 --> 05:23.900
But I really need
you to come home,

05:23.900 --> 05:27.133
So we can figure everything out.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.467
I understand why you've
run away from all this

05:29.467 --> 05:32.267
And I'm really trying
to support you,

05:32.267 --> 05:35.067
But if the three of
us just finished this,

05:35.067 --> 05:37.733
Then we can all finally
move on with our lives.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.200
Anyway, please call me
back when you get this.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.133
I love you Sam.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.433
(Foreboding music)

07:00.067 --> 07:01.900
(Coins rattling)

07:02.800 --> 07:07.333
(Phone line beeping)

07:12.933 --> 07:17.700
(Phone line beeping)

08:07.733 --> 08:12.500
(Ominous music)

08:45.400 --> 08:47.467
[Voiceover] Did you get
a hold of Brian today?

08:47.467 --> 08:50.067
Is he gonna meet you out
here if you can't find Sam?

08:50.067 --> 08:51.133
No.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.067
I don't know where he is.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.700
But Brian, he just
doesn't even care.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.233
He used to be the
sweetest guy ever.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.933
Like he would cry if
someone killed a bird.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.067
Oh my God, he has just
become such an asshole.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.767
I can't even remember
the last time he said,

09:08.767 --> 09:10.067
"I love you."

09:12.300 --> 09:13.867
What the hell is that?

09:13.867 --> 09:15.067
[Voiceover] I don't know.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.500
(Screeching)

09:18.500 --> 09:21.667
Molly, we need to go!

09:21.667 --> 09:23.700
We need to get
back to the cabin.

09:23.700 --> 09:27.967
(Ominous music)

09:32.533 --> 09:37.200
(Wind gushing)
(rumbling)

09:53.067 --> 09:57.067
(Rattling)

10:02.933 --> 10:05.633
(Hissing)

10:05.633 --> 10:10.600
[Voiceover] Sam,
where are you Sam?

10:12.767 --> 10:14.800
Where are you?

10:17.733 --> 10:19.567
(Door opening)

10:21.400 --> 10:22.467
(Door slamming shut)

10:22.467 --> 10:27.433
(Wind gushing)
(ominous music)

10:38.200 --> 10:43.200
(Foreboding music)

10:55.733 --> 10:57.467
[Voiceover] The
news calls it a virus.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.167
But Sam explains it differently.

11:07.533 --> 11:11.167
January 24th, I received
a package from Sam

11:11.167 --> 11:13.733
Two weeks ago,
asking me to return

11:13.733 --> 11:15.867
To our family's
old vacation spot.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.767
This is a message in a bottle
for humanity, he calls it.

11:23.433 --> 11:28.367
(Spray can hissing)

11:33.967 --> 11:35.733
Now first things first.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.300
If you going out
into their territory

11:37.300 --> 11:39.533
You have to make yourself
invisible to them.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.167
Ash from the dead
conceals your presence

11:47.167 --> 11:50.067
When they are near, never
leave home without it.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.900
Surround the
perimeter of wherever

11:55.900 --> 11:57.800
You may camp with
the ash as well,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.533
It helps throw off your scent.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.067
And make sure not to
stay at any spot longer

12:05.067 --> 12:06.433
Than a night or two.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.967
If you're ever unsure
of their presence,

12:08.967 --> 12:10.600
Remember that they
communicate with one another

12:10.600 --> 12:12.800
Using some sort of radio wave.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.767
You can pick up their chatter
using a low-frequency radio.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.467
But very rarely
will you actually

12:17.467 --> 12:19.800
Hear them, and more
commonly you'll pick up

12:19.800 --> 12:22.700
Ghost radio waves,
this will let you know

12:22.700 --> 12:23.867
You're in the clear.

12:23.867 --> 12:28.267
(Swing music)

12:28.767 --> 12:31.267
And if your radio should
fail you for any reason,

12:31.267 --> 12:33.167
There is one other step
you can take to observe

12:33.167 --> 12:34.467
Their presence.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.300
Any camera with infrared
can pick them up,

12:38.300 --> 12:39.767
They seem to be formed of light

12:39.767 --> 12:41.367
That the naked eye can't see,

12:41.367 --> 12:43.167
Some type of energy.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.867
They don't seem to have
a physical presence.

12:45.867 --> 12:48.633
But perhaps almost a
form of light radiation,

12:48.633 --> 12:50.367
Or a soul.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.467
If you're here in
Tasmania, you are in

12:53.467 --> 12:55.133
Enemy territory.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.967
Never let your guard down.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.167
The frequency of
them seems to depend

12:59.167 --> 13:01.567
On how many people
have died in the area,

13:01.567 --> 13:04.367
And don't confuse this with
where people are buried,

13:04.367 --> 13:07.400
Graveyards actually
seem to be safe houses,

13:08.067 --> 13:10.100
And in closing, (mumbling),

13:10.100 --> 13:12.067
Keep your use of
electricity to a minimum,

13:12.067 --> 13:15.133
As it seems to attract
or even spawn them.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.833
They seem to feed off of it.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.700
He didn't seem sure
who would receive

13:21.700 --> 13:25.333
This message, but, for
some reason it found me.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.300
(Swing music)

13:33.167 --> 13:34.700
Is what he says true?

13:38.367 --> 13:40.067
He claimed he'd keep
moving and survive

13:40.067 --> 13:42.667
For as long as he could
until he was rescued.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.800
Do I still have
time to find him?

14:05.667 --> 14:08.133
(Foreboding music)

14:08.133 --> 14:11.067
(Fly buzzing)

14:38.700 --> 14:42.133
(Radio static buzzing)

14:42.133 --> 14:46.867
(Swing music)

14:52.367 --> 14:54.567
* I met a girl the other night

14:54.567 --> 14:56.967
* In fact she was divine

14:56.967 --> 14:59.233
* She lived out in the country

14:59.233 --> 15:01.733
* Three miles from
the river line

15:01.733 --> 15:03.900
* I called to see
her the other night

15:03.900 --> 15:06.433
* Stayed late, I missed my train

15:06.433 --> 15:08.133
* Her Pa discovers me

15:08.133 --> 15:11.233
* And throws me
right out in the rain

15:11.233 --> 15:14.067
* I got right up and walked
and walked and walked

15:14.067 --> 15:16.067
* And walked and walked

15:16.067 --> 15:17.933
* I did not have her number

15:17.933 --> 15:20.733
* Or else I would
not have had hope

15:20.733 --> 15:23.067
* Put down my head and in my bed

15:23.067 --> 15:25.467
* Put all my hope
throughout my test

15:25.467 --> 15:27.733
* And got right up
and walked along

15:27.733 --> 15:30.133
* And walked, and
walked and walked *

16:10.067 --> 16:15.067
(Radio static buzzing)

16:16.467 --> 16:21.100
(Television static buzzing)

16:35.100 --> 16:37.633
* See that girl was by my side

16:37.633 --> 16:42.067
* Least I now know, (mumbling)

16:42.067 --> 16:44.400
* And I ain't say
call all over us

16:44.400 --> 16:46.733
* My girl jumped in the air

16:46.733 --> 16:48.133
* She sits on the rooftop

16:48.133 --> 16:52.600
(Foreboding music)

17:00.167 --> 17:02.067
(Radio buzzing)

17:02.067 --> 17:03.233
[Voiceover] Good
evening everybody,

17:03.233 --> 17:05.733
Tonight's guest is Sam Everett,

17:05.733 --> 17:08.700
A poor unfortunate soul
searching for his parents

17:08.700 --> 17:11.367
Even though they're
already dead.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.400
But then what are
you gonna find?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.633
What brings (mumbling),

17:15.633 --> 17:17.067
You're not looking in
the right places, buddy.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.500
We're halfway
outside your house

17:18.500 --> 17:22.067
At this very moment, waiting
to give you a big hug!

17:22.067 --> 17:23.599
We don't bite Sam,

17:23.599 --> 17:25.233
Now throw that crown upside down

17:25.233 --> 17:26.967
And let us in buddy!

17:26.967 --> 17:30.600
(Radio static buzzing)

17:30.600 --> 17:35.567
(Calming music)

17:35.567 --> 17:38.167
* I've traveled east,
I've traveled west

17:38.167 --> 17:40.700
* I've been in every state

17:40.700 --> 17:43.067
* A member of the
knights of rest

17:43.067 --> 17:45.400
* With dues paid up to date

17:45.400 --> 17:47.700
* There's just two
things that I despise

17:47.700 --> 17:50.067
* Two things I always shirk

17:50.067 --> 17:52.200
* The first thing
is a cake of soap

17:52.200 --> 17:54.433
* The other one is work

17:54.433 --> 17:56.733
* My life to me is just as free

17:56.733 --> 17:58.933
* I'm always on a lark

17:58.933 --> 18:01.067
* Somebody said
you're just a bum

18:01.067 --> 18:03.400
* And I don't like that remark

18:03.400 --> 18:05.700
* Who said I was a Bum

18:05.700 --> 18:07.833
* Who said I was a Bum

18:07.833 --> 18:10.067
* I haven't worked for 20 years

18:10.067 --> 18:12.133
* I guess I'm not so dumb

18:12.133 --> 18:14.233
* And as a tramp along the road

18:14.233 --> 18:16.533
* The people hear me hum

18:16.533 --> 18:18.500
* I know I'm a hobo

18:18.500 --> 18:21.100
* But who said I was a bum

18:21.100 --> 18:22.100
* I must admit

18:22.100 --> 18:25.400
* I never fit in any job and say

18:25.400 --> 18:27.433
* Whenever I see a pile of wood

18:27.433 --> 18:29.700
* I look the other way

18:29.700 --> 18:31.767
* I haven't shaved
in many a year

18:31.767 --> 18:33.867
* I really am afraid

18:33.867 --> 18:36.067
* Because I fear my wire beard

18:36.067 --> 18:38.333
* Would break the razor blade

18:38.333 --> 18:40.300
* The other day while on my way

18:40.300 --> 18:42.433
* A cop gave me a chase

18:42.433 --> 18:44.100
* I thought I heard him holler

18:44.100 --> 18:46.700
* Take that mattress
off-a your face

18:46.700 --> 18:48.733
* Who said I was a bum

18:48.733 --> 18:50.833
* Who said I was a bum

18:50.833 --> 18:52.867
* Of death and easy, go inside

18:52.867 --> 18:55.067
* Of things that easy come

18:55.067 --> 18:57.067
* A bum with
nickels, now and then

18:57.067 --> 18:59.167
* They keep me full of rum

18:59.167 --> 19:01.067
* I know I'm a hobo

19:01.067 --> 19:03.900
* But who said I was a bum

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
* My coat is worn,
my shoes are torn

19:08.500 --> 19:10.767
* There's holes in both my toes

19:10.767 --> 19:12.067
* And what is worse

19:12.067 --> 19:14.900
* I always nurse a
blossom on my nose

19:14.900 --> 19:16.167
* And with a glance

19:16.167 --> 19:19.067
* You'll see my pants
are baggy at the knees

19:19.067 --> 19:20.233
* They're worn so thin

19:20.233 --> 19:22.067
* I feel the wind
blow through my BVDs

19:22.067 --> 19:23.567
(Wind gushing)

19:23.567 --> 19:25.233
* But there ain't
nothing that worries me

19:25.233 --> 19:27.233
* Now what is that about

19:27.233 --> 19:29.233
* There's never
something on my mind

19:29.233 --> 19:31.300
* Except a dirty hat

19:31.300 --> 19:33.200
* But who said I was a bum

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
* Who said I was a bum

19:35.200 --> 19:37.200
* Don't think I'm a lonesome guy

19:37.200 --> 19:39.333
* Because I look so glum

19:39.333 --> 19:41.333
* I've got a lot
of cootie friends

19:41.333 --> 19:43.500
* That keep me on the hum

19:43.500 --> 19:45.367
* I know I'm a hobo

19:45.367 --> 19:47.667
* But who said I was a bum

19:47.667 --> 19:52.633
(Radio static buzzing)
(foreboding music)

19:52.633 --> 19:54.467
(Screeching)

19:56.433 --> 19:57.967
[Voiceover] Come back Sam.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.800
You can't hide from me.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.767
You can't hide from me, Sam.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.300
Where are you going?

20:07.367 --> 20:08.900
* I know I'm a hobo

20:08.900 --> 20:09.933
* But who said I

20:09.933 --> 20:14.533
(Radio static buzzing)

20:20.400 --> 20:22.333
[Voiceover] January 25th.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.700
I only have two weeks
left until the boat

20:24.700 --> 20:26.500
I hired comes back for me.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.267
And if I don't make
it back in time,

20:28.267 --> 20:29.567
He will leave without us.

20:29.567 --> 20:33.733
(Ominous music)

20:48.333 --> 20:50.000
Sam is here somewhere.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.933
And I know for sure now.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.867
I've picked up some
sort of trail of his,

21:00.867 --> 21:03.100
But, where does it lead?

21:29.433 --> 21:30.500
Whatever happened
here has somehow

21:30.500 --> 21:32.367
Made the electricity come alive.

21:36.067 --> 21:38.633
It seems to react to a
person's presence at will.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.867
Or is this just the virus?

22:10.767 --> 22:12.800
Keep hiding Sam, and stay safe.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.200
I'm coming.

22:24.567 --> 22:27.500
(Country music)

22:27.500 --> 22:30.400
* Look up, look down

22:30.400 --> 22:33.200
* That railroad line

22:33.200 --> 22:37.533
* And bow your head and cry

22:38.700 --> 22:41.433
* The longest train

22:41.433 --> 22:44.067
* I ever saw

22:44.067 --> 22:48.467
* Was 80 coaches long

22:49.300 --> 22:51.767
* The engine passed

22:51.767 --> 22:54.300
* At eight o'clock

22:54.300 --> 22:58.400
* And the cab went by at nine

22:59.367 --> 23:01.800
* Look up, look down

23:01.800 --> 23:04.233
* That railroad line

23:04.233 --> 23:08.800
* And bow your head and cry

23:08.800 --> 23:13.700
(Humming)

23:18.767 --> 23:21.100
* Little girl, little girl

23:21.100 --> 23:23.433
* Don't you tell me no lies

23:23.433 --> 23:27.433
* Where did you stay last night

23:28.100 --> 23:30.400
* I stayed in jail

23:30.400 --> 23:32.633
* 99 days

23:32.633 --> 23:37.067
* With my face
turned to the wall

23:37.067 --> 23:42.067
(Humming)

23:46.233 --> 23:48.500
* Little girl little girl

23:48.500 --> 23:50.733
* What have I done

23:50.733 --> 23:54.367
* You turned your back on me

23:55.467 --> 23:57.533
* Take all my clothes

23:57.533 --> 23:59.467
* Throw them all outdoors

23:59.467 --> 24:00.600
* Farewell

24:00.600 --> 24:01.800
[Voiceover] Help me!

24:02.800 --> 24:03.933
Please.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.067
This way Sam.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.300
Hurry Sam.

24:08.933 --> 24:11.067
(Rumbling)

24:11.067 --> 24:12.433
[Voiceover] I've got you Sam,

24:12.433 --> 24:16.667
You little brat,
there is no escape.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.700
It's no use Sam.

24:19.700 --> 24:23.433
Sam you can't hide from me.

24:23.433 --> 24:28.167
(Rumbling)
(ominous music)

24:36.633 --> 24:40.833
(Screeching)

24:40.833 --> 24:43.500
I'm going to stop you Sam.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.200
I know you're here.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.200
(Rattling)

24:51.700 --> 24:56.233
(Distorted screeching speech)

25:19.800 --> 25:24.667
(Foreboding music)

25:27.800 --> 25:29.433
[Voiceover] January 26th.

25:30.633 --> 25:32.500
He began to stay
closer to the sea,

25:32.500 --> 25:34.433
Away from civilization,
as he attempted

25:34.433 --> 25:36.200
To figure out what
they actually were.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.167
His research is
hard to understand,

25:50.167 --> 25:52.567
He goes on and on
about several things,

25:52.567 --> 25:54.467
Such as
inter-dimensional beings,

25:54.467 --> 25:57.300
Shadow people, and even aliens.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.800
He claimed that
legends and history

25:58.800 --> 26:00.933
Seemed to blend, to intertwine,

26:00.933 --> 26:02.733
And even lose focus.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.067
He believed that
ghosts were simply

26:06.067 --> 26:07.300
A generalization.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.567
Or a misanalysis of that.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.433
And they would
prey on the energy

26:13.433 --> 26:15.200
Of misfortune and suffering.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
They can come to our side

26:20.500 --> 26:22.733
Through some sort of portals.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.533
He seemed to think
that there are

26:24.533 --> 26:26.667
These portals, or hot spots,

26:26.667 --> 26:28.367
All over the world,

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
Where the spirits
can come to our side.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.100
Is Tasmania really
one of those places?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.700
He concluded that these portals

26:47.700 --> 26:49.300
Explained the areas of the world

26:49.300 --> 26:51.200
Where the foulness and
suffering of humanity

26:51.200 --> 26:52.767
Never seemed to clear.

26:56.233 --> 26:58.400
His final note was
merely a question.

27:01.567 --> 27:04.267
"Will there always be a dark
cloud over these places?"

27:07.400 --> 27:09.300
"Or can the portals be closed?"

27:11.700 --> 27:13.367
"And can the light return?"

27:14.633 --> 27:16.067
Where are you Sam?

27:20.967 --> 27:23.267
(Radio static buzzing)

27:23.267 --> 27:26.467
[Voiceover] The whole
fury and might of the enemy

27:26.467 --> 27:29.467
Must very soon be turned on us.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.600
Hitler knows that he
will have to break us

27:33.600 --> 27:36.267
In this island or lose the war.

27:36.267 --> 27:39.733
But if we fail, then
the whole world,

27:39.733 --> 27:42.500
Including the United States,

27:44.067 --> 27:47.367
Including all that we
have known and cared for,

27:47.367 --> 27:51.400
Will sink into the
abyss of a new dark age

27:51.400 --> 27:53.800
Made more sinister...

27:53.800 --> 27:56.067
So these are your
ghosts huh Sam?

27:56.067 --> 27:59.333
(Radio static buzzing)

27:59.333 --> 28:00.800
[Voiceover] It's me again.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.667
I really need to talk to you.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.600
We've always got through
stuff like this together.

28:07.533 --> 28:11.200
I just wanted to make sure
that you got mom's necklace.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.733
I left it in your mailbox.

28:15.067 --> 28:16.200
Now...

28:16.733 --> 28:20.200
She came to, to
see me last night.

28:20.867 --> 28:21.933
I couldn't even look at her

28:21.933 --> 28:23.567
For about 10 minutes.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.533
But when I finally
did, she gave a message

28:27.533 --> 28:29.233
For you and Brian.

28:29.767 --> 28:32.100
She wanted you to keep
her necklace close.

28:32.767 --> 28:35.200
Because you will need it.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.067
It's gotta feel
good if this is you.

28:38.067 --> 28:40.167
(Mumbling), please babe.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.833
It's such a long
time since I've seen

28:42.833 --> 28:44.467
Anything like this.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.133
Am I going crazy?

28:47.700 --> 28:50.933
Or do you see that too?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.233
Have you seen Mom and Dad
yet since they've died?

28:55.233 --> 28:59.733
(Radio static buzzing)

29:01.733 --> 29:06.733
(Camera static buzzing)

29:12.067 --> 29:17.067
(Foreboding music)
(wind gushing)

29:40.433 --> 29:42.267
[Voiceover] You can't
hide from me, Brian.

29:42.267 --> 29:43.367
[Brian] Oh shit.

29:44.600 --> 29:48.633
(Car engine revving)

29:48.633 --> 29:50.967
[Voiceover] You can't
run from me forever.

29:55.267 --> 29:59.467
(Foreboding music)

30:23.533 --> 30:27.867
(Rattling)

30:27.867 --> 30:32.433
(Growling)

31:00.400 --> 31:05.300
(Cheerful music)

31:17.333 --> 31:21.200
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

31:21.200 --> 31:24.867
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

31:24.867 --> 31:28.900
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

31:28.900 --> 31:32.767
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

31:48.400 --> 31:52.067
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

31:52.067 --> 31:55.900
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

31:55.900 --> 31:59.800
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

31:59.800 --> 32:03.533
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

32:19.067 --> 32:22.800
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

32:22.800 --> 32:26.467
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

32:26.467 --> 32:30.300
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

32:30.300 --> 32:34.367
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

32:49.600 --> 32:52.700
* Oh feed me on
cornbread and peas *

32:56.467 --> 32:58.433
(Relaxing music)

32:58.433 --> 33:01.100
* One evening as
the sun went down

33:01.100 --> 33:04.167
* And the jungle
fire was burning

33:04.167 --> 33:07.233
* Down the track
came a hobo hiking

33:07.233 --> 33:10.300
* And he said, boys
I ain't turning

33:10.300 --> 33:13.500
* I'm headed for a
land that's far away

33:13.500 --> 33:16.433
* Beside the crystal mountain

33:16.433 --> 33:19.567
* So come with me
we'll all go and see

33:19.567 --> 33:22.333
* The Big Rock Candy Mountains

33:22.333 --> 33:25.333
* Yeah, the Big
Rock Candy Mountains

33:25.333 --> 33:28.100
* There's a land
that's fair and bright

33:28.100 --> 33:31.067
* Where the handouts
grow on bushes

33:31.067 --> 33:34.100
* And you sleep out every night

33:34.100 --> 33:37.133
* Where the boxcars
all are empty

33:37.133 --> 33:40.167
* And the sun shines every day

33:40.167 --> 33:42.667
* On the birds and bees
and the cigarette trees *

33:42.667 --> 33:46.800
[Voiceover] January 27th,
I now only see two options.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.233
Either I'm affected, and
the virus story was real,

33:50.233 --> 33:52.733
Or it's the somehow
more frightening option.

33:52.733 --> 33:54.867
Sam was right.

33:56.233 --> 33:57.467
Which would mean he was hiding

33:57.467 --> 33:59.267
Because something
was following him.

34:00.067 --> 34:02.867
Whatever the case, I'm amazed
he survived here this long.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.900
I can explain ghost radio waves,

34:05.900 --> 34:08.233
They're old radio broadcasts
that bounce around the world

34:08.233 --> 34:11.100
For years, that's science.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.167
But how did the radio find
something from my past?

34:15.833 --> 34:17.199
Is this real?

34:18.800 --> 34:21.100
Why is all of this
becoming so familiar?

34:23.733 --> 34:26.967
* In the Big Rock
Candy Mountains

34:26.967 --> 34:29.667
* You never change your socks

34:29.667 --> 34:32.733
* And the little old
streams of alcohol

34:32.733 --> 34:35.632
* Come a tricklin'
down the rocks

34:35.632 --> 34:38.766
* Where the brakemen
have to tip their hats

34:38.766 --> 34:42.067
* And the railroad
bulls are blind *

34:42.067 --> 34:43.600
January 28th.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.100
For some reason Sam
has decided to go to

34:47.100 --> 34:49.733
The most haunted
island in Australia.

34:50.533 --> 34:54.667
I have no ordinary explanation
for why Sam would go there

34:54.667 --> 34:56.533
Of all places.

34:59.633 --> 35:03.700
* Every Monday morning
they've got 'em out on time

35:03.700 --> 35:07.700
* March 'em down to Lone Rock,
said to look into that mine

35:07.700 --> 35:12.067
* March you down to Lone Rock,
said to look into that hole

35:12.067 --> 35:16.067
* Very last word the captain
say, you better get your coal

35:16.067 --> 35:18.300
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

35:18.300 --> 35:19.800
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line *

35:19.800 --> 35:22.100
(Radio static buzzing)

35:22.100 --> 35:24.433
[Voiceover] The outbreak
cannot be stopped.

35:24.433 --> 35:27.333
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.433
From Maria Island.

35:29.433 --> 35:31.667
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

35:34.067 --> 35:38.200
* Way back yonder in Tennessee,
they leased the convicts out

35:38.200 --> 35:42.500
* They worked 'em in the coal
mines against free labor stout

35:42.500 --> 35:46.667
* Free labor rebelled against
it, to win it took some time

35:46.667 --> 35:48.800
* But while the
lease was in effect

35:48.800 --> 35:51.167
* They made 'em rise and shine

35:51.167 --> 35:53.733
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

35:53.733 --> 35:56.400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

35:56.400 --> 36:00.500
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

36:00.500 --> 36:02.267
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

36:02.267 --> 36:04.400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

36:04.400 --> 36:09.167
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

36:24.267 --> 36:28.100
* Every Monday morning
they've got 'em out on time *

36:28.100 --> 36:31.167
(Radio static buzzing)

36:31.167 --> 36:33.500
[Voiceover] Brian,
uh it's Molly.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.400
I've been trying to
call you all night.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.567
Why won't you just pick
up your goddamn phone

36:40.567 --> 36:42.067
To (mumbling)?

36:43.300 --> 36:45.133
Hey, in the bathtub.

36:46.733 --> 36:49.067
You know I wanna tell
you there's no point,

36:49.067 --> 36:54.067
But Dad was drunk-driving
and something,

36:54.600 --> 36:57.600
Something just went wrong.

36:58.800 --> 37:03.567
And now both of our
parents, they're dead.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.467
No, please, please!

37:06.467 --> 37:09.200
I just, I need one minute!

37:10.500 --> 37:13.600
Okay, I don't know
what to do here.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.700
They're trying to
take them away.

37:17.067 --> 37:18.633
I really need your help.

37:19.500 --> 37:23.933
When I got here,
Mom was still alive.

37:25.167 --> 37:27.400
Maybe she (mumbling) with...

37:28.067 --> 37:31.533
No please, I just need,
I just need one minute.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.800
Brian...

37:34.800 --> 37:36.433
I need you!

37:37.167 --> 37:38.867
And I don't know how
I'm gonna tell Sam

37:38.867 --> 37:40.133
Any of this.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.567
He really looks up to you.

37:43.300 --> 37:47.900
We need you, (mumbling).

37:49.767 --> 37:51.633
(Sighs) I have to go.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.300
Please help me.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.633
* March you down to Lone Rock

37:58.633 --> 38:00.733
* Said to look into that hole

38:00.733 --> 38:04.600
* Very last word the captain
say you better get your coal

38:04.600 --> 38:07.067
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

38:07.067 --> 38:09.467
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

38:09.467 --> 38:13.600
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

38:13.600 --> 38:15.400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

38:15.400 --> 38:17.867
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

38:17.867 --> 38:21.100
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line *

38:21.100 --> 38:25.667
(Foreboding music)

38:25.667 --> 38:27.867
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.133
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.133
From Maria Island?

38:33.133 --> 38:35.700
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.767
This outbreak cannot be stopped.

38:39.300 --> 38:42.067
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

38:42.067 --> 38:44.067
From Maria Island?

38:44.067 --> 38:46.133
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

38:46.133 --> 38:50.800
(Foreboding music)

39:54.600 --> 39:56.633
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

39:57.333 --> 40:00.033
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

40:00.033 --> 40:01.667
From Maria Island?

40:01.667 --> 40:04.300
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

40:09.800 --> 40:14.433
(Rattling)
(growling)

40:43.333 --> 40:47.967
(Cheerful music)

40:47.967 --> 40:49.433
January 29th.

40:50.567 --> 40:52.167
I have one week
left to find Sam,

40:52.167 --> 40:53.800
But I still need to
cross eight kilometers

40:53.800 --> 40:55.067
Of ocean to get him.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.067
Now if I'm going
into enemy territory,

41:08.067 --> 41:09.467
I need to find a way to stop

41:09.467 --> 41:11.067
Whatever these things are
if I come into contact

41:11.067 --> 41:12.267
With one again.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.300
(Electricity sparking)

41:30.867 --> 41:32.933
They seem to
communicate in some way

41:32.933 --> 41:36.567
With ghost radio waves,
some sort of infra-sound.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.333
Somehow the radios
can pick it up.

41:44.067 --> 41:47.200
Let's say they're
ghosts like Sam claims.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.367
But what are ghosts, really,

41:49.367 --> 41:51.433
Scientifically, no fantasy.

41:51.433 --> 41:53.633
What are all people
at their core?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.333
Energy.

41:59.167 --> 42:00.467
And how do you destroy something

42:00.467 --> 42:02.300
That can neither be
created nor destroyed?

42:03.567 --> 42:05.467
You destroy its power source.

42:05.467 --> 42:07.467
Destroy what it feeds off of.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.933
Sam claimed electricity
attracted them

42:10.933 --> 42:12.400
Or even responded to them.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.067
So what do we do?

42:18.500 --> 42:20.067
We turn off the lights.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.567
An electromagnetic pulse.

42:36.700 --> 42:40.400
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

42:40.400 --> 42:44.333
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

42:44.333 --> 42:48.133
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

42:48.133 --> 42:51.733
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way *

42:58.500 --> 43:00.233
All right come on you bastards.

43:05.700 --> 43:10.100
(Rattling)
(moaning)

43:10.100 --> 43:11.167
There we go.

43:11.167 --> 43:15.400
(Foreboding music)

43:17.267 --> 43:18.267
[Voiceover] You wanna see Sam,

43:18.267 --> 43:19.667
I know you do Brian.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.833
I can smell you.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.300
You're coming back home
with your brother, Brian.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.400
That's right you son
of a bitch, over here.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.600
[Voiceover] You cannot
run from me Brian.

43:31.067 --> 43:34.100
Brian, guess who's back?

43:34.100 --> 43:35.333
Almost...

43:35.333 --> 43:36.933
[Voiceover] I know
you're up here, Brian.

43:36.933 --> 43:38.967
I'm coming Brian.

43:38.967 --> 43:40.300
Almost...

43:40.300 --> 43:42.167
[Voiceover] Your
soul is mine, Brian!

43:42.167 --> 43:42.967
Now!

43:42.967 --> 43:45.900
(Electricity crackling)

44:05.267 --> 44:06.767
January 30th.

44:07.567 --> 44:09.300
If I don't make it back,

44:09.300 --> 44:11.567
Whoever finds this,

44:11.567 --> 44:14.633
EMP is how you stop them.

44:15.800 --> 44:16.900
It seems to send them back

44:16.900 --> 44:18.433
To wherever they come from.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.300
Hope trumps fear, Sam.

44:25.067 --> 44:26.167
I'm coming.

44:26.167 --> 44:30.733
(Foreboding music)

45:17.233 --> 45:19.933
(Radio static buzzing)

45:19.933 --> 45:21.533
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.867
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

45:24.867 --> 45:27.467
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

45:27.467 --> 45:29.733
Stay away from Maria Island.

45:29.733 --> 45:31.467
Something is here.

45:31.467 --> 45:33.400
We have accidentally
opened something.

45:33.400 --> 45:36.300
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

45:44.767 --> 45:49.367
(Foreboding music)

46:18.300 --> 46:20.900
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

46:20.900 --> 46:23.067
Stay away from Maria Island.

46:23.833 --> 46:25.333
Something is here.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.633
We have accidentally
opened something.

46:28.333 --> 46:31.067
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

46:32.067 --> 46:33.767
There is no escape.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.533
Help yourselves and
evacuate from Tasmania

46:37.533 --> 46:39.133
At all costs.

46:44.867 --> 46:46.467
January 31st.

46:47.133 --> 46:48.567
I've determined that either Sam

46:48.567 --> 46:50.467
Is still somewhere
on this island,

46:50.467 --> 46:52.467
Or he has at least been
here very recently.

46:53.433 --> 46:55.800
This distress call seems
to be getting clearer

46:55.800 --> 46:57.333
The closer I get
to the mountain.

46:57.833 --> 46:59.300
So tomorrow I'm
gonna try to attempt

46:59.300 --> 47:01.300
To hike to the summit and
see if I can find the source

47:01.300 --> 47:02.567
Of the signal.

47:03.300 --> 47:05.100
I think it's what
Sam would've done.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.933
And it's really the only lead
I have at this point, so.

47:10.900 --> 47:12.567
The boat leaves in five days.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.067
[Voiceover] Hello
again everybody,

47:17.067 --> 47:19.233
We have a special
guest with us tonight,

47:19.233 --> 47:20.967
Brian Everett!

47:20.967 --> 47:22.967
It must feel like
you're on Maria Island,

47:22.967 --> 47:25.133
All dressed up
with nowhere to go.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.833
It's terrible being
invited to a party

47:26.833 --> 47:28.233
When no one's home!

47:28.233 --> 47:29.533
Take it from us folks!

47:29.533 --> 47:30.933
(Laughing)

47:30.933 --> 47:32.500
Well you just need patience.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.167
Rest assured, the welcome mat

47:34.167 --> 47:36.833
Has been laid out
too for you, Brian.

47:36.833 --> 47:39.833
Enjoy your home and
see you soon buddy!

47:44.467 --> 47:46.900
[Voiceover] Okay do
not try and rescue us.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.767
There is no escape.

47:51.267 --> 47:53.867
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

47:53.867 --> 47:55.900
Stay away from Maria Island.

47:56.900 --> 47:58.500
Something is here.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.667
We have accidentally
opened something.

48:01.333 --> 48:04.067
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

48:05.067 --> 48:06.667
There is no escape.

48:08.133 --> 48:10.467
Help yourselves and
evacuate from Tasmania

48:10.467 --> 48:11.967
At all costs.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.167
[Voiceover] Go back, Brian.

48:20.167 --> 48:21.533
Don't follow the river.

48:21.533 --> 48:22.633
Sam?!

48:25.133 --> 48:26.400
[Voiceover] Go back, Brian.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.467
[Brian] Sam?

48:28.533 --> 48:29.700
Sam?!

48:29.700 --> 48:30.600
[Voiceover] Don't
follow the river.

48:36.833 --> 48:37.767
Sam?

48:38.767 --> 48:39.733
Sam?!

48:50.667 --> 48:52.467
Please goddammit no, no!

48:52.467 --> 48:54.133
Come on, Sam come on,

48:54.133 --> 48:56.167
Come on wake up, wake up.

48:56.167 --> 48:57.233
Come on!

48:57.233 --> 48:59.233
Oh no goddammit, come on!

49:00.900 --> 49:02.933
What, no man, come
on, wake up Sam,

49:02.933 --> 49:04.233
Come on wake up, wake up!

49:05.233 --> 49:07.700
One, two, three!

49:08.933 --> 49:10.433
Come on, come on wake up!

49:10.433 --> 49:12.133
One, two, three!

49:14.733 --> 49:15.633
Come on you can't come this far

49:15.633 --> 49:17.200
Just to stop Sam, come on!

49:17.200 --> 49:19.067
One, two, three!

49:19.867 --> 49:21.067
Come on!

49:21.800 --> 49:23.367
One, two, three!

49:25.367 --> 49:26.733
One, two!

49:26.733 --> 49:31.233
(Sad music)

50:02.100 --> 50:03.667
What the hell is the point?

50:06.800 --> 50:10.700
Just come and get me assholes.

50:13.367 --> 50:14.767
Come and get me.

50:21.633 --> 50:23.700
[Voiceover] Brian, Brian?

50:24.433 --> 50:27.267
Oh come on, this is
the best you got guys?

50:28.200 --> 50:29.600
Screw you.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.767
[Voiceover] Brian it's
me, where the hell are you?

50:33.767 --> 50:35.467
Bullshit it's you.

50:35.467 --> 50:36.933
[Voiceover] Oh
you're here too?

50:36.933 --> 50:40.433
Yup on Maria Island
like you told me.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.633
[Voiceover] No, I
told you to stay away

50:42.633 --> 50:43.867
From Maria Island.

50:43.867 --> 50:45.600
There's something
there, a doorway.

50:46.100 --> 50:47.167
A doorway?

50:48.433 --> 50:49.467
And where are you?

50:49.467 --> 50:51.033
[Voiceover] On the other side.

50:51.033 --> 50:52.367
I went through.

50:53.867 --> 50:55.600
That's funny because

50:56.467 --> 50:57.967
I'm looking at your
dead body right now.

50:57.967 --> 50:59.233
[Voiceover] What?

51:00.467 --> 51:02.433
I just found it lying
here next to the river.

51:02.433 --> 51:03.667
[Voiceover] Oh shit.

51:03.667 --> 51:04.833
Yeah.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.933
[Voiceover] I
don't understand.

51:06.933 --> 51:08.733
I'm still alive, I
followed this track

51:08.733 --> 51:10.767
All up the river,
and found a cave.

51:10.767 --> 51:12.233
But there's something
in that cave, Brian.

51:12.233 --> 51:15.067
It's some kind of electrical
doorway to another place.

51:15.067 --> 51:16.800
I think it's where
they came from.

51:16.800 --> 51:18.300
Like an old house.

51:18.300 --> 51:19.800
That's where I am now.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.933
Then why the hell
did you go through it?

51:21.933 --> 51:23.533
[Voiceover] I
thought I saw our dad.

51:23.533 --> 51:25.233
I wanted to apologize.

51:25.233 --> 51:26.600
Apologize?

51:27.600 --> 51:28.933
Mom is dead.

51:29.567 --> 51:31.100
Dad is dead.

51:33.167 --> 51:34.167
And now you're dead.

51:34.167 --> 51:35.233
[Voiceover] Do
you still really

51:35.233 --> 51:36.667
Only think in black and white

51:36.667 --> 51:38.067
After seeing what we've seen?

51:38.667 --> 51:40.667
Tell science to get
lost for just a second,

51:40.667 --> 51:42.267
Believe me Brian.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.800
I have no idea what I've seen.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.067
I don't even know what
the hell I'm talking to

51:47.067 --> 51:48.600
Right now, okay?

51:49.567 --> 51:53.367
All I know is that, Sam is dead.

51:54.933 --> 51:57.467
I have no idea what the
hell I'm gonna do now.

51:58.267 --> 51:59.533
[Voiceover] Keep going.

52:00.367 --> 52:01.833
What?

52:01.833 --> 52:04.533
[Voiceover] If you're going
through hell, keep going.

52:05.900 --> 52:07.300
Are you really there?

52:07.300 --> 52:08.767
[Voiceover] Yes, but
something is holding me here.

52:08.767 --> 52:11.167
I think it's Dad, or (mumbling).

52:11.167 --> 52:12.900
I need your help, Brian.

52:12.900 --> 52:14.800
How am I supposed to
help you if you're dead.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.100
[Voiceover] Go
through the doorway,

52:16.100 --> 52:17.533
Find our old house.

52:17.533 --> 52:19.133
What the hell are
you talking about?

52:19.133 --> 52:20.867
[Voiceover] You'll
wake up in a pool,

52:20.867 --> 52:22.533
Go to the woods and
follow the signs for home,

52:22.533 --> 52:23.933
Through the abandoned buildings.

52:23.933 --> 52:25.100
Please Brian.

52:25.700 --> 52:26.800
Sam?

52:27.133 --> 52:27.900
Sam?!

52:28.433 --> 52:29.233
Sam...

52:31.633 --> 52:36.067
(Foreboding music)

52:43.200 --> 52:44.700
So you're alive huh?

52:53.400 --> 52:54.633
You know?

52:56.667 --> 52:59.533
I used to see ghosts
when I was a kid too.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.200
Back before you were even born.

53:04.900 --> 53:05.933
I never responded
to 'em or anything,

53:05.933 --> 53:08.667
I just didn't want 'em to,

53:08.667 --> 53:10.500
Actually I didn't wanna
get near 'em you know?

53:12.467 --> 53:14.100
I thought maybe I
could trick 'em or,

53:15.067 --> 53:16.233
Play stupid.

53:18.133 --> 53:19.633
I didn't even think I actually

53:20.567 --> 53:22.133
Ever knew what they were.

53:22.133 --> 53:23.500
Until right now.

53:25.100 --> 53:27.133
I mean the last time I
saw them I was probably

53:27.133 --> 53:28.700
I don't know, four or five.

53:31.900 --> 53:35.700
But what I saw was

53:37.200 --> 53:39.400
You looking exactly
like you do right now.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.967
And all you'd ever
say to me was,

53:44.333 --> 53:45.633
"Save me."

53:46.767 --> 53:48.233
Over and over.

53:51.633 --> 53:55.100
I don't know if you
really are Sam or not,

53:57.267 --> 53:59.100
And I don't know if
this is a trap or not,

54:02.300 --> 54:03.833
But I'm coming for you.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.100
All of you!

54:10.500 --> 54:13.200
And I'm gonna send
every last one of you

54:14.300 --> 54:16.067
Back to where you belong.

54:39.767 --> 54:41.800
This message is
for Molly Everett,

54:41.800 --> 54:43.733
Her address is 4085,

54:43.733 --> 54:46.267
Chariot Lane, Santa
Barbara, California.

54:47.967 --> 54:51.067
Molly if you are watching this,

54:52.100 --> 54:54.600
It means I've failed and
that both Sam and I are dead.

54:57.067 --> 54:58.167
I know that

54:58.867 --> 55:00.833
You had a really
hard time growing up,

55:01.700 --> 55:03.367
And I know I was
never there for you

55:03.367 --> 55:04.533
When I should've been,

55:05.267 --> 55:07.200
And I know that
you've been mad at me

55:07.200 --> 55:09.700
For, (mumbling),
coming down here

55:09.700 --> 55:11.600
To try to save my brother, but,

55:12.500 --> 55:14.067
In a classic Dad move,

55:14.967 --> 55:16.133
The problem with the will was

55:16.133 --> 55:19.167
That he didn't even
leave us anything.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.467
He gave everything to some guy.

55:23.100 --> 55:25.133
Some friend of his,
and I've been down here

55:25.133 --> 55:26.267
For a month.

55:26.767 --> 55:28.700
Trying to convince this guy

55:28.700 --> 55:29.867
To give me some money

55:29.867 --> 55:31.867
So I can afford
to see my brother.

55:36.433 --> 55:38.867
But it's okay...

55:40.100 --> 55:41.533
If you do get this Molly,

55:42.200 --> 55:44.733
Please just don't be afraid.

55:45.933 --> 55:49.533
Okay, fear, it's the
easiest emotion to have,

55:50.367 --> 55:51.567
You know that's why
Dad always used it,

55:51.567 --> 55:53.467
That's why he was
always addicted to it.

55:54.467 --> 55:55.667
He would always use it on us,

55:55.667 --> 55:57.333
Whenever his life
wasn't going his way.

55:58.233 --> 55:59.267
And...

56:01.700 --> 56:04.067
Just nothing when we were kids,

56:04.067 --> 56:04.967
When you grew up, nothing

56:04.967 --> 56:06.967
Has ever been your fault, Molly.

56:06.967 --> 56:09.233
Okay, okay?

56:09.767 --> 56:11.967
Don't let Dad's
weakness ruin you,

56:11.967 --> 56:14.933
Don't, just don't let his
bullshit ruin your life.

56:15.700 --> 56:17.400
Okay, because you're
better than that.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.767
Mom and Dad were not our family.

56:22.667 --> 56:25.700
We were our family,
just you, Sam and I.

56:25.700 --> 56:26.933
That's it.

56:27.867 --> 56:29.333
And it always will be.

56:30.667 --> 56:33.333
Just let your bullshit
go and go live your life.

56:34.133 --> 56:35.733
Because you were
always the smartest

56:35.733 --> 56:37.833
Of us, and you were
always the best of us.

56:38.933 --> 56:40.500
And I should've
told you more, but,

56:40.500 --> 56:42.267
I just never did.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.733
Please just go do
something great, Molly.

56:47.733 --> 56:49.367
Because I know you can.

56:51.833 --> 56:53.567
And if you're looking
for Dad's ashes,

56:54.200 --> 56:55.633
I've dig 'em up, in an effort

56:55.633 --> 56:56.833
To finally try to use him

56:56.833 --> 56:58.300
For something good for once.

57:00.767 --> 57:04.733
I wanna use him to help
me save our brother.

57:07.867 --> 57:09.200
Goodbye Molly.

57:09.200 --> 57:13.567
(Sad music)

57:54.133 --> 57:56.467
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

57:56.467 --> 57:58.833
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

57:58.833 --> 58:01.367
Stay away from Maria Island.

58:01.367 --> 58:03.067
Something is here.

58:03.067 --> 58:05.433
We have accidentally
opened something.

58:05.433 --> 58:08.133
Some kind of portal
into another world.

58:08.133 --> 58:09.700
We're outside.

58:09.700 --> 58:12.367
We're there now, and
there is no escape.

58:12.367 --> 58:14.267
Do not try and rescue us.

58:14.267 --> 58:16.933
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.767
This (mumbling).

58:20.333 --> 58:23.333
If you stay here in
Tasmania, you will die.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.500
We are here (mumbling).

58:26.233 --> 58:30.067
Help yourselves to evacuate
from Tasmania at all costs.

58:30.433 --> 58:35.433
(Anticipating music)

59:01.733 --> 59:06.733
(Faint country music)

01:00:23.267 --> 01:00:24.533
[Voiceover] Save me.

01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:25.767
[Brian] Sam!

01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:27.267
Sam?

01:00:27.267 --> 01:00:31.967
(Foreboding music)

01:00:48.133 --> 01:00:49.333
[Voiceover] Brian?

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.600
Brian.

01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:53.800
Keep going, sweet.

01:00:54.933 --> 01:00:56.300
Follow my voice.

01:01:00.133 --> 01:01:01.467
Follow my voice.

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:05.967
Keep going, sweet.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.733
You need to hurry Brian.

01:01:13.233 --> 01:01:15.067
Your brother is in trouble.

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:25.067
Hey Mom.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.300
[Voiceover] Yes honey.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.800
I don't have much time
before he takes me again.

01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:32.833
Who Mom?

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.133
[Voiceover] Listen to me.

01:01:35.633 --> 01:01:37.800
Your device will
not work as it is.

01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:40.367
It's not powerful enough yet

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.633
To destroy him.

01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:43.067
What are you talking about?

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:45.533
[Voiceover] It
needs more energy.

01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:48.700
You must use my soul
as the catalyst.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.833
What do you mean?

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.467
[Voiceover] Take my necklace.

01:01:54.733 --> 01:01:56.900
Now you have all that I am.

01:01:57.367 --> 01:01:59.867
Place that in your machine
when you activate it.

01:02:00.567 --> 01:02:02.867
Use me as your power source.

01:02:03.533 --> 01:02:04.800
I don't understand.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.500
[Voiceover] Brian I
am his counterbalance.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.333
You have to do this.

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.233
It has to be you.

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:14.767
Or we'll never be free.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.767
What if I do this?

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:18.267
What happens to you?

01:02:19.067 --> 01:02:20.567
Will you be gone forever?

01:02:21.067 --> 01:02:22.900
[Voiceover]
Nothing's gone, Brian.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.100
It's just not there anymore.

01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:28.800
Honey?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.767
Baby, I'm so sorry
for everything

01:02:30.767 --> 01:02:32.633
You kids had to go through.

01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:36.533
You must do this so that
I can finally help you,

01:02:37.067 --> 01:02:38.567
It's the only way.

01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:40.967
I'm so proud of you Brian.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.067
I love you Brian.

01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:47.333
I love all of you.

01:02:53.133 --> 01:02:58.133
(Phone ringing)

01:03:04.267 --> 01:03:05.467
[Voiceover] Save me.

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:23.567
[Voiceover] Hey
Dad, it's Brian.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.767
Look I know it's been
a really long time

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.300
Since we talked, and,

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.967
I know the last time
didn't go so well,

01:03:28.967 --> 01:03:31.667
But, I just,

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.200
Look Dad, I can't
keep pretending

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.067
Like at you did to
us never happened.

01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:39.233
I've been trying for years, but,

01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:41.300
It just won't go away.

01:03:42.467 --> 01:03:44.100
Every time I see Molly and Sam

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.600
I can see them
where you left 'em,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.267
And I can see

01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:49.533
How they can't
even look at people

01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:51.167
In the eyes anymore
because of you.

01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:53.167
And it kills me.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.333
Because unlike you,

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.733
I actually care for
them more than anything

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.100
Else in the world.

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:02.400
And now since you
are what you are,

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.467
The job to protect
them has fallen on me.

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:08.200
And I'm sure you'll just
call me overdramatic

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.867
Or a liar like usual, you know,

01:04:09.867 --> 01:04:11.267
Whenever I try to
bring up the truth

01:04:11.267 --> 01:04:12.833
About things you are
probably too drunk

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.067
To even remember.

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:16.900
But that doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

01:04:17.467 --> 01:04:19.767
You have done some
horrible things to us.

01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.867
And ever since I
remember, you've taught

01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:24.167
Me through your actions
that you were the one

01:04:24.167 --> 01:04:27.167
Thing I should fear more
than anything or anyone else.

01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.467
But I'm not a kid anymore,

01:04:29.467 --> 01:04:30.667
And I don't have
to bite my tongue

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:31.667
And pretend like we deserved

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.067
What you did to us.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.700
I may be your child, but,
I'm not your property.

01:04:37.733 --> 01:04:39.967
Now if you ever want to have
a relationship with me again,

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:42.100
You need to call me and
finally apologize for what you

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.367
Did to all of us.

01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:45.967
Otherwise,

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.767
This is it.

01:04:49.533 --> 01:04:50.767
Goodbye Dad.

01:04:57.933 --> 01:04:59.600
[Voiceover] Good
evening everybody,

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.100
Tonight we're going to explore

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.867
The dark history of
the Everett family.

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.600
All of their ghosts and demons

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.567
Under the floorboard
will be revealed!

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.100
(Cheerful music)

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:31.800
Here was the dreaded kitchen

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.267
Where Mommy and Daddy Everett's

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:35.133
Drinking problem began.

01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:37.433
Daddy would stay up
all night drinking away

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:40.700
Both his problems
and Mommy's money.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.300
The children could
be heard yelling

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.667
Into the wee hours
of the morning.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.633
Poor little Molly, Sam and Brian

01:05:46.633 --> 01:05:48.567
Were defenseless,
and could only watch

01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:50.367
In terror as their parents would

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:53.467
Turn themselves into monsters.

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:01.433
The living room, the
television was the children's

01:06:01.433 --> 01:06:04.567
Only friend in this
house of terror.

01:06:04.567 --> 01:06:06.533
A place of sanctuary for them

01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:08.567
To manage their
wounds and pretend

01:06:08.567 --> 01:06:10.833
They had different lives.

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:28.733
And poor, poor, Sam.

01:06:28.733 --> 01:06:30.533
When he'd see things
his father couldn't

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:33.233
Understand, he would
become a punching bag.

01:06:33.233 --> 01:06:35.533
This is the dreaded
room where'd he pray

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.967
Every night, not for
the safety of others,

01:06:38.967 --> 01:06:41.900
But the demise of
his own father,

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.400
Praying that one day he wouldn't

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.067
Have to wear long-sleeved shirts

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.467
For the rest of his life

01:06:46.467 --> 01:06:48.167
To hide his secrets.

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:52.067
Where or where was
his big brother?

01:07:00.567 --> 01:07:02.600
Little Molly's bedroom,

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.300
She thought the
more toys she had,

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.233
The more friends she'd have!

01:07:06.233 --> 01:07:07.800
Unfortunately all they ever did

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.800
Was trap her in the
(mumbling) prison,

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.633
And constantly remind
her there was no way out.

01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:15.467
She became deaf to advice,

01:07:15.467 --> 01:07:17.600
Trapped in her own world.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.667
No way Brian would
ever come home

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:23.833
To save them, he'd
never be her hero again.

01:07:36.567 --> 01:07:40.367
And last but not least,
the oldest child, Brian.

01:07:40.367 --> 01:07:43.567
He was always so
quiet, they said.

01:07:43.567 --> 01:07:45.600
He handled their
troubled childhood

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.733
The best, they said.

01:07:47.733 --> 01:07:49.733
Brian was the strong one.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.467
The devil's advocate.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:54.100
Nothing ever got to Brian.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.300
No one would ever expect
Brian to kill his own parents.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.167
I didn't kill them.

01:08:00.733 --> 01:08:02.933
[Voiceover] Dad
is dead, Brian.

01:08:02.933 --> 01:08:05.833
(Audience booing)

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:08.067
It was an accident,
nobody was gonna miss them.

01:08:08.067 --> 01:08:10.833
[Voiceover] Except
poor little Brian.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:11.967
What are the odds people

01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:14.333
That some cookie
eggheads opened the door

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:15.667
To another world,

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:18.533
Brian here would enter
it after doing something

01:08:18.533 --> 01:08:20.600
So bad.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.899
It wasn't my fault.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.367
[Voiceover] Such
a shocking moment

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.832
That changed the
Everett family forever.

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:28.767
But stay tuned folks,
after the break

01:08:28.767 --> 01:08:30.966
We're going to the
most terrifying room

01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:35.067
In the house, Daddy's room.

01:08:38.233 --> 01:08:39.399
It wasn't my fault.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:44.267
(Foreboding music)

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:50.966
[Voiceover] Hey Sam it's me.

01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:54.633
Look I uh, I'm really sorry

01:08:54.633 --> 01:08:56.067
I didn't show up to
the funeral today,

01:08:56.067 --> 01:08:59.633
But, I just couldn't
bring myself to be there.

01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:02.700
And I know you and
Molly needed me,

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.567
I'm sure especially
today of all days,

01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:07.867
But, I have something

01:09:07.867 --> 01:09:09.567
That I need to tell you right.

01:09:10.733 --> 01:09:13.100
Look, I saw Mom and Dad
the night they died.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.367
Oh it had been
years, and I figured

01:09:16.367 --> 01:09:17.933
I tried to patch
things up with them,

01:09:17.933 --> 01:09:19.966
See if I could salvage anything,

01:09:19.966 --> 01:09:22.700
But, when I saw them,

01:09:23.733 --> 01:09:25.367
Dad started drinking

01:09:25.367 --> 01:09:28.067
And he starting hitting Mom.

01:09:29.067 --> 01:09:30.733
I couldn't take it anymore,

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.466
So I tried to make him stop,

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:34.733
But, of course he wouldn't.

01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:37.067
Then I tried to take Mom away,

01:09:37.067 --> 01:09:39.633
But, she wouldn't come with me.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.067
So I just let her
in the car with dad.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.800
I watched them both drive away.

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:47.933
I knew how drunk Dad was.

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:50.567
I couldn't come today because,

01:09:51.433 --> 01:09:53.167
Because I let our parents die.

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.800
It's because I was angry.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.800
Because I love you guys
more than anything,

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.533
And, I hope someday
you understand

01:10:00.533 --> 01:10:01.867
Why I did what I did,

01:10:01.867 --> 01:10:04.567
Because, my place in the world

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.733
Is just to protect both of you,

01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:08.033
From people like them.

01:10:09.433 --> 01:10:11.100
I'm so sorry Sam.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.833
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:10:16.533 --> 01:10:17.367
Goodbye.

01:10:17.367 --> 01:10:21.900
(Distant country music)

01:10:32.067 --> 01:10:32.833
(Growling)

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.567
[Voiceover] Brian.

01:10:38.433 --> 01:10:39.867
Brian.

01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:44.300
Brian.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.700
This way, Brian.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.867
How could you not
recognize your own father?

01:10:56.467 --> 01:10:58.767
Your own (mumbling),

01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:01.133
Your never-ending nightmare.

01:11:01.867 --> 01:11:03.100
Right now...

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.267
[Voiceover] Are you
not afraid of me, Brian?

01:11:06.867 --> 01:11:08.233
Well in that case,

01:11:08.233 --> 01:11:09.867
Apologize finally.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.067
For what you did to us.

01:11:13.067 --> 01:11:15.833
Or I will destroy all of you.

01:11:15.833 --> 01:11:17.833
[Voiceover] You
cannot destroy us.

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:20.167
Nor can you create us.

01:11:20.167 --> 01:11:23.567
But soon, you will become us.

01:11:23.567 --> 01:11:25.667
You will all be down here.

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:28.400
Your sister, your brother,

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.333
Your friends, everyone
you've ever known.

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:35.867
You will all come down here.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.833
That's interesting.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:39.167
What you just said.

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:40.100
That you can neither be created

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.400
Nor destroyed?

01:11:42.067 --> 01:11:43.500
Because on the other hand,

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.867
Electricity, which
is what it seems like

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:47.933
You things feed
off of down here,

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:49.933
Actually can be destroyed.

01:11:49.933 --> 01:11:51.867
(Laughing)

01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:54.267
[Voiceover] You do
not have the power.

01:11:54.267 --> 01:11:58.833
You can either try it
before you, (mumbling)

01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:03.133
For the (mumbling).

01:12:03.133 --> 01:12:06.300
You are forever
trapped down here.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.633
You know what I think?

01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:10.067
I think Sam was right.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.533
I think that these portals
are all over the place.

01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:14.867
I think there was
probably even one

01:12:14.867 --> 01:12:16.600
Near this very house when
we were kids, wasn't there?

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.233
You've been with us
forever, haven't you?

01:12:19.733 --> 01:12:21.500
And now you're just
afraid of losing us.

01:12:22.133 --> 01:12:23.900
You're just afraid
of losing our fear.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.733
[Voiceover] You think
you can destroy me

01:12:25.733 --> 01:12:27.067
With that?

01:12:28.267 --> 01:12:29.700
Seems simple enough.

01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:32.067
I mean after all, how do
you turn off the lights?

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.233
You just press the
off switch, right?

01:12:34.233 --> 01:12:37.633
[Voiceover] Foolish boy,
you think it is that simple?

01:12:38.233 --> 01:12:40.967
Yeah, it is that simple.

01:12:41.967 --> 01:12:44.300
And I only have one
thing left to say to you.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.633
From the very,

01:12:47.433 --> 01:12:49.100
Very bottom of my heart.

01:12:49.967 --> 01:12:51.733
Fuck you, Dad.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:57.400
(Electricity crackling)

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.167
(Laughing)

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.067
(Radio static buzzing)

01:14:09.067 --> 01:14:10.267
[Voiceover] It's
been nearly three hours

01:14:10.267 --> 01:14:11.767
Since the strange
light was seen above

01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:13.100
Eastern Tasmania,

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.067
And so far, the
government is unavailable

01:14:15.067 --> 01:14:16.267
For comment.

01:14:16.267 --> 01:14:17.733
Rumors are spreading fast

01:14:17.733 --> 01:14:19.567
That Tasmania's
quarantine may finally

01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:21.600
Be lifted in the coming days.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.333
More info as it comes.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:25.700
Until then, more music.

01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:32.133
(Calming music)

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:40.633
[Voiceover] Hello?

01:14:41.067 --> 01:14:42.333
[Voiceover] Hey
Molly, it's Brian.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.833
I found him.

01:14:44.467 --> 01:14:45.667
[Voiceover] Is he okay?

01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:47.633
[Voiceover] Yeah,
yes, he looks fine.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:49.567
[Voiceover] How did
you find him, Brian?

01:14:50.067 --> 01:14:51.800
[Voiceover] I finally
did what I had to do.

01:14:54.433 --> 01:14:56.067
Look Molly, sometimes,

01:14:56.067 --> 01:14:58.733
We need to just stop trying
to explain everything.

01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:00.167
Just say thank you.

01:15:01.067 --> 01:15:03.633
[Voiceover] Fine, thank you.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:07.333
I guess I'll see you
when you get back.

01:15:08.233 --> 01:15:11.333
[Voiceover] Hey Molly,
I'm here all right?

01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:14.900
From now on, I promise

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.533
That we're all gonna be okay.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:20.500
I love you Molly.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.467
[Voiceover] I love you too.

01:15:24.467 --> 01:15:28.933
(Calming music)

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.900
* And I

01:15:34.067 --> 01:15:36.333
* Hope you can relate

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.567
* And you've got lots

01:15:42.567 --> 01:15:46.233
* Of worries that
you can't put to bed

01:15:47.733 --> 01:15:51.567
* And I don't need
to be one of them

01:15:55.367 --> 01:15:59.267
* And I can't seem to get her

01:15:59.267 --> 01:16:02.067
* To tell me the truth

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:06.167
* And I don't want it to be

01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:08.200
* Like that

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.300
* When I'm sick

01:16:13.567 --> 01:16:14.933
* And dying

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:42.800
* She told me that
you never raised

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.233
* Your voice at her once

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.900
* And now she runs

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.333
* When it gets tough

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.800
* When it gets tough

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.700
* But I

01:17:03.233 --> 01:17:05.667
* Made a mistake

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.733
* And I

01:17:13.533 --> 01:17:15.833
* Hope you can relate

01:17:19.633 --> 01:17:22.167
* And I've got questions

01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:26.267
* And I've got questions for you

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.267
* And I've got questions

01:17:32.267 --> 01:17:36.700
* And I've got things
you need to prove *
