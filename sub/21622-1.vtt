00:33.800 --> 00:35.279
All aboard!

02:03.600 --> 02:05.352
All right, let's go.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.314
That's my main man Pierce
coming back from the war!

02:13.400 --> 02:14.469
Thank you! Thank you, man.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.632
Hey, what's happening, Jack?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.279
Private party.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.232
Pick another card.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.673
There you go!

02:51.200 --> 02:53.077
Oh, I see what you're saying.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.672
There we go!

02:58.440 --> 03:00.271
Damn it! Give me that shit.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.238
Party's over!

03:03.440 --> 03:04.873
Here we go. Move on out.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.474
Move on out.
Step out! Step out!

03:07.720 --> 03:09.756
Everybody out! Out!

03:10.240 --> 03:11.240
Let's go!

03:11.320 --> 03:13.550
I know you can hear me.
Get the fuck up and go!

03:13.640 --> 03:16.040
I don't care what you
do during the week. Get out!

03:17.800 --> 03:20.109
Party's over!
Let's get it moving!

03:20.200 --> 03:21.713
You know how this works!

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Says who?

03:24.640 --> 03:25.675
I'm sorry?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.352
Man, take a hike!

03:27.440 --> 03:29.556
Come in here
smelling like pig juice!

03:33.800 --> 03:36.109
Excuse me, miss.
Thank you so much.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.456
What'd you say?

03:37.480 --> 03:39.118
I ain't said anybody
talking... Hey, man!

03:42.040 --> 03:44.873
Come on, man! Let me go, man!
Let me go!

03:48.240 --> 03:49.912
Hold on a second.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.072
Get the fuck out!
Get out! Get out!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.438
How many times
you want me to say it?

03:56.520 --> 03:57.919
You're moving slow!

03:59.400 --> 04:00.833
Come on, man!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.638
Motherfuckers, man!

04:03.480 --> 04:05.391
Look, Frank, man.
The owner split.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.913
Man, I'm sorry,
but you got a room

04:07.000 --> 04:08.718
full of open warrants
in there. All right?

04:08.840 --> 04:11.991
Just make sure you search
the women, you lazy bastard.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.912
All right. Watch your eyes.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, shit!

04:18.360 --> 04:20.271
You know
that's not right, brother!

04:22.280 --> 04:23.429
No, no, no!

04:27.440 --> 04:28.919
We gotta go
through the front.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.468
What? You wanna take these
guys out in public, Sarge?

04:31.560 --> 04:33.437
We have no fucking option.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.953
Go tell them. Run.
All right.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.030
You dirty pig!
Get the fuck out of here.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.149
Anybody else?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.754
Why're we not moving?
You wanna go next?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.193
Out, out, out!

04:46.280 --> 04:47.936
All right,
party's over, folks. Let's go!

04:47.960 --> 04:49.439
You heard him.
Time to move out!

04:49.520 --> 04:51.272
Put your drinks down
and step out the door.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.776
I do not understand,
I thought I was very clear!

04:53.800 --> 04:55.199
Let's go! Come on!

04:55.280 --> 04:56.599
Out of here! Let's go!
Come on!

04:56.680 --> 04:57.696
Congratulations.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.950
Get the fuck out! How many times
I gotta say "Move out"?

05:00.040 --> 05:01.439
Let's go!

05:01.520 --> 05:03.795
I know your black asses
is faster than that.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.949
Go!

05:05.120 --> 05:07.236
Let's move! Come on!
Move! Let's go!

05:08.160 --> 05:09.991
On your feet!
Move it! Let's go!

05:12.480 --> 05:14.198
We're taking them out front.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.713
Out the front door!
Let's go! Now!

05:15.800 --> 05:16.840
Taking them out the front.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.393
Shit!

05:18.920 --> 05:19.920
Out the front!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.836
Guys, sir, both sides.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.354
Up against
the wall. Against the wall.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.919
Let's move it. Come on.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.400
Let's go!

05:32.760 --> 05:34.910
Here we go. Squad's here.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.155
If they're not resisting,
don't push them.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.919
Put it right there.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.920
Right here against the wall.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.554
Welcome home!

05:49.560 --> 05:50.675
Thank you, sir.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.557
Get out the way.
Get out the way!

05:52.840 --> 05:54.512
Hands where we can see them.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.192
We had to use the front door.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.590
Shit!
Make it a public display.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.599
I almost feel bad for them.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.951
We gotta get out of here.
Quickly.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.589
Let's go! Get them in!

06:05.800 --> 06:08.040
All right! Start
loading them up! Let's go!

06:09.800 --> 06:10.949
Okay, let's go!

06:12.960 --> 06:14.359
Look at this shit!

06:15.400 --> 06:17.550
Let's hurry!
Get it out of here!

06:17.880 --> 06:19.108
Get it out! Let's go!

06:23.120 --> 06:24.917
Make sure we get
those guys at the back.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.752
What are you doing down here
all the time?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.456
We gotta get this moving!

06:33.480 --> 06:34.549
Stop messing with us.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.868
These people
didn't do a thing.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.234
Where's the other one?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.072
It should be here any minute.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.309
What did they do?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.158
Please calm down!
Everything's fine.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.834
Finally!

06:50.920 --> 06:51.920
Over here.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.469
This is our neighborhood
and here y'all come.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.829
That's not necessary.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.149
Open the door! Get them in!

07:04.440 --> 07:05.839
Arrests for
a private gathering?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.359
That's police overreach!

07:07.520 --> 07:09.590
You got no liquor license
on this place.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.238
Get the fuck out of my face.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.675
Let's just keep it calm.
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:18.440 --> 07:21.637
Come on! Get in
the damn van! Step in there!

07:25.480 --> 07:26.515
Move, let's go!

07:27.000 --> 07:28.877
Let's get them moving,
gentlemen!

07:29.040 --> 07:31.952
Let's go!
Get them in the wagon!

07:33.160 --> 07:36.038
Hey, Dave! Told you you'd
get busted, you alcoholic!

07:36.280 --> 07:37.713
Oh, the night's not over!

07:40.200 --> 07:41.679
Go home!
Go home!

07:41.840 --> 07:42.989
Go home!

07:43.160 --> 07:44.388
You go home!

07:49.560 --> 07:51.480
- Get them in.
- Last one.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.874
Get them in!

07:54.040 --> 07:55.519
You punk-ass
motherfuckers!

07:59.720 --> 08:00.856
Let's go, get in!

08:00.880 --> 08:02.233
Don't touch me!

08:02.800 --> 08:04.233
Let's go! In!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.719
I'm moving!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.558
Get in! Let's go!

08:12.200 --> 08:13.758
Get in the car! Let's go!

08:41.280 --> 08:42.837
Check this, motherfuckers!

09:04.200 --> 09:06.111
Bub, can't even
ride that bike!

09:06.360 --> 09:08.641
You know good and well you don't
know how to ride no bike.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.432
Do it, man! Throw it!

09:12.600 --> 09:13.794
Catch this!

09:15.880 --> 09:17.950
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

09:18.480 --> 09:20.277
It's show time now!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.296
Destroyers
striking from as far as three miles

09:31.320 --> 09:33.754
away from this
west side ghetto,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.149
where it all began
early this morning

09:36.240 --> 09:38.515
with a police raid on an
after-hours drinking parlor.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.150
There have been
some reports of gunfire.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.595
Police are under orders
not to fire.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.592
More than 200 looters
have been arrested so far.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.910
Police officials say they
do not have enough men

09:49.000 --> 09:50.433
to worry much
about the looters.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.670
They are there
to protect the firemen.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.357
But that is
why you elected me.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.188
To bring about change.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.959
But during this time,

10:03.160 --> 10:06.277
it's important that
we all settle down.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.030
- Settle yourself!
- I know you're angry.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.599
I'm angry, too.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.797
This city has problems,
especially with the policemen.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.949
We have problems.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.033
However,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.511
change doesn't
happen overnight.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.109
But change is coming.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.349
Let's work together!

10:26.440 --> 10:28.874
Nah! Bring Stokely Carmichael
down here!

10:29.040 --> 10:30.792
We don't wanna hear
from your ass!

10:30.960 --> 10:34.032
Look here.
This is what I need you to do!

10:34.200 --> 10:37.510
I need you to not mess up
your own neighborhood.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.238
This is your home!

10:39.400 --> 10:40.549
Yeah, burn it down!

10:40.720 --> 10:42.711
Burning it down
is not the answer!

10:44.480 --> 10:46.675
Burn it down! Burn it down!

10:49.800 --> 10:51.313
Settle down! Settle down!

10:58.200 --> 11:00.509
Hoses up! Hoses up!

11:00.720 --> 11:02.711
Get that engine
in a little closer!

11:03.360 --> 11:05.032
Engine four, let's relay!

11:05.200 --> 11:07.509
Come on! Roll it back!
You gotta roll it back.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.718
We gonna let
this motherfucker burn!

11:17.320 --> 11:18.355
What the fuck!

11:18.440 --> 11:20.000
Let's move back! Come on!

11:20.200 --> 11:21.679
Get out of here!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.576
At the
request of Mayor Cavanaugh,

11:34.600 --> 11:35.669
we've made state police

11:35.760 --> 11:37.193
and National
Guardsmen available

11:37.280 --> 11:40.590
to assist in dealing
with what is a case

11:40.720 --> 11:42.870
of lawlessness and hoodlumism

11:43.040 --> 11:45.349
and to protect
the persons and property

11:45.440 --> 11:47.795
of people
in the areas involved.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.351
Here in Detroit, a city of war

11:50.480 --> 11:52.038
where snipers
hide on rooftops,

11:52.120 --> 11:53.473
the violence continues.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.560
US Army paratroopers,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.710
National Guardsmen,
state and local police

11:56.800 --> 11:59.712
are continuing the fight
against a handful of snipers.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.396
On the city's west side, a 150-block
area is off-limits to everybody.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.234
This is no man's land, an area
of destruction and devastation.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.231
ABC newsman Tom Mclntyre says

12:10.320 --> 12:12.550
it's hard to believe that this
could happen in America.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.791
But here it is, in Detroit,
the nation's fifth largest city.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.559
I am declaring
a public state of emergency.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.758
And I am also indicating
that I will promulgate

12:22.840 --> 12:26.276
such rules,
orders and regulations

12:26.400 --> 12:29.472
as I deem necessary
to protect life and property.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.592
Second unit,
left lane!

12:35.760 --> 12:36.795
18-40!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.633
Rally point! Rally point A!

12:45.200 --> 12:47.270
Sniper in the window!

12:50.160 --> 12:51.639
Third floor window!

12:51.720 --> 12:53.551
Move to cover!
Move to cover now!

12:53.640 --> 12:55.835
Stand by! Hold your fire!

13:05.960 --> 13:08.190
Don't move!
All right, he's clear.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.719
Move back!

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Hey!

13:42.400 --> 13:44.152
Oh, I almost hit that one.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.509
There is no American right

13:57.600 --> 13:59.158
to loot stores

13:59.600 --> 14:01.113
or to burn buildings,

14:01.200 --> 14:03.395
or to fire rifles
from the rooftops.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.599
That is crime.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.959
And crime must be
dealt with forcefully

14:09.680 --> 14:12.194
and swiftly,
and certainly under law.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.696
...LBJ tell you

14:13.720 --> 14:15.676
that, "Violence never
accomplishes anything,

14:15.760 --> 14:17.216
"my fellow Americans."

14:17.240 --> 14:19.674
Don't you see,
the real problem with violence

14:19.760 --> 14:22.354
is that we have
never been violent.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.873
We have been too nonviolent!

14:41.600 --> 14:43.397
Excuse me!

14:44.560 --> 14:46.551
Go back
the way you came!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.296
I need to go down this road
to get to work.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.878
What did I say? Back!

14:49.960 --> 14:52.315
I need to go down this road
to get to work, Ford Assembly.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.913
Hold on! Where you going?

14:54.120 --> 14:55.758
Hey! Let him go!

14:57.280 --> 14:58.998
You cannot go this...

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
Take cover!
We might have a sniper on...

15:05.400 --> 15:07.277
Boy, would you look at this.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.313
So sad.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.469
It's preventable, you know.
That's the worst part.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.440
Look at this.
This looks like fucking 'Nam.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.833
You believe this is the USA?

15:16.920 --> 15:18.319
And we're to blame.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.309
By standing by,
the trouble started. Now this.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.511
What can you do with this?

15:30.520 --> 15:31.589
They're crazy.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.991
They're not crazy. They know
exactly what they're doing.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.111
This is gonna
be worse than '43.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.440
No, we need to stop
failing these people.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.016
They're looking to us, and
we keep letting them down

15:48.040 --> 15:49.155
left, right, and center.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.438
Take this motherfucker
right here. Halt!

15:57.040 --> 15:58.359
Halt!

15:58.640 --> 15:59.675
Halt!

16:02.880 --> 16:04.199
Get back!

16:05.720 --> 16:07.016
- Stay off the street!
- Halt!

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
Back up!

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
Hey!

16:11.400 --> 16:12.549
Come here!

16:13.800 --> 16:14.835
Get back off the street!

16:25.200 --> 16:26.553
Hey, Phil! Come on!

16:26.720 --> 16:28.915
Hey, Phil!
Forget him! Come on!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.149
Fuck!

16:33.880 --> 16:36.155
You're not supposed to
shoot the looters anyway.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.073
Yeah.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.549
How the hell
are we supposed to stop them?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.750
What a fucking specimen, huh?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.588
Confound it!

17:07.760 --> 17:10.354
What... What are you doing
under there?

17:10.520 --> 17:13.079
I just live down the street.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.028
If you can go
get my wife Roberta?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.156
You want me to
call the ambulance?

17:18.240 --> 17:19.719
No, no police!

17:19.880 --> 17:21.551
Just, please, Roberta.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.789
Goodness!

17:24.119 --> 17:25.473
Get me Roberta.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.795
1,100 National Guardsmen

17:30.880 --> 17:32.393
have been rushed
into as many areas

17:32.480 --> 17:34.869
as they can cover,
protecting police.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.474
Looters carry off thousands
of dollars' worth of goods

17:37.600 --> 17:39.670
with a gay sort of leisure.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.069
Many negro shop owners
put up signs

17:42.160 --> 17:44.549
reading "Soul Brother"
to avoid damage.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.471
But the fire bombers
and looters

17:46.560 --> 17:47.675
are indiscriminate.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.856
Just cuff him to the chair.

17:48.880 --> 17:49.976
I'll get to him
when I get a second.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.616
Write your address
and your date of birth.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.834
Talk to him!

17:52.920 --> 17:54.120
Where am I supposed
to put him?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.912
I don't care. Take him
to your house!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.296
Let's move
these negroes out of here!

17:57.320 --> 17:58.469
There's no room!

18:00.600 --> 18:01.669
Sergeant!

18:02.680 --> 18:04.591
Homicide detectives
wanna have a word with you.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.736
Quit pushing! You got room

18:05.760 --> 18:07.079
for two more
in holding or not?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.958
Step back from
the goddamn counter!

18:11.120 --> 18:13.680
Come on, move!
Behind the door!

18:14.760 --> 18:16.671
Hey! Whose prisoner is this?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.638
Don't talk to me!

18:22.360 --> 18:23.679
For God's sake.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.960
Sit the fuck down
and shut up!

18:26.280 --> 18:28.840
Krauss, in here. I need you.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.514
Go, come on.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.033
Guys, come on. Out.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.079
I got a young black,

18:37.160 --> 18:39.720
shotgunned in the vicinity
of Virginia Park.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.357
Did I hear earlier
you shot a black guy?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.556
I missed, called it in.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.713
You missed?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.791
I might've clipped him.
He was real fast.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.668
Sit down, patrolman. Sit down.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.158
What's the hold up?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.256
Schools, city offices

19:06.280 --> 19:08.350
and many stores remain
closed today in Detroit,

19:08.440 --> 19:11.113
and a 9:00 p.m. curfew has
been ordered for this evening.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.715
Hey, Ma.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.835
Hey.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.079
I got it.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.915
Hello.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.753
No, I'm off.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.112
I worked a double.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.157
Okay. All right.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.668
What? Back to work?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.512
Yeah, Mr. LeFrank called.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.238
I thought Vinny
was your boss.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.356
I got two jobs,
two bosses, Ma.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.670
Security company needs me
for the looting.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.110
Looting?
Yeah, watch the news.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.872
Nowhere to run to, baby

20:10.560 --> 20:12.471
Nowhere to hide

20:13.800 --> 20:17.395
Got nowhere
to run to, baby

20:18.040 --> 20:19.519
Nowhere to hide

20:21.360 --> 20:24.397
It's not love
I'm running from

20:25.000 --> 20:28.151
It's the heartbreak
I know will come

20:28.320 --> 20:29.673
What do you say there, Fred?
Hey.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.875
Yo, you're late.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.616
Listen, I almost lost my job
getting here. I'm sorry.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.551
I don't give a damn
about Ford Motor Company.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.216
Bumper cars and sheet metal
motherfucker?

20:36.240 --> 20:37.440
You about to be
with the stars!

20:37.480 --> 20:39.675
But I need to
buy bread, negro.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.154
Listen, it's gonna be good.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.915
You sure?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.160
All right?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.672
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.831
I need you here, man.
I'm here!

20:56.000 --> 20:58.150
What you need?
Water or something?

20:58.360 --> 20:59.918
I know
you're no good for me

21:01.840 --> 21:03.910
But you've
become a part of me

21:04.080 --> 21:05.229
Is that A&R man out there?

21:05.400 --> 21:09.393
Yeah, he out there, waiting
to get his mind blown, baby.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.593
When it's so deep
So deep

21:16.720 --> 21:18.517
Deep inside of me

21:18.680 --> 21:19.720
All right, folks, come on.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.896
Let's get this together.
You ready?

21:20.920 --> 21:22.035
Get these steps together.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.536
Hold on. Let me get
that note one more time.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.959
If you haven't got

21:25.120 --> 21:27.873
Love

21:29.040 --> 21:31.873
Love

21:33.040 --> 21:36.112
A traveling man
once told me

21:36.280 --> 21:38.191
That he didn't ever care

21:38.280 --> 21:39.793
Watch your spacing.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.715
That any time
he wants to go

21:44.400 --> 21:46.914
That he go anywhere

21:47.080 --> 21:51.710
If you haven't got love
Love believe me

21:52.400 --> 21:55.551
The traveling man
once told me

21:55.720 --> 21:59.395
If you haven't got love
Love will leave me

21:59.560 --> 22:01.835
Then you're lonely
So lonely

22:02.000 --> 22:04.275
You're lonely
So lonely

22:04.440 --> 22:06.396
You're lonely
So lonely

22:06.560 --> 22:08.676
Oh, yeah
If you haven't got

22:14.920 --> 22:17.275
You're up next, boys.
Let's get it! Come on!

22:23.240 --> 22:25.117
It's Motown, baby.
All right. Are we ready?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.559
Give it up!

22:36.040 --> 22:38.793
Motown Records, baby.
Motown, we're Motown tonight.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.036
All right, settle down, cats.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.736
Now, I know you guys
think that we reached

22:42.760 --> 22:44.796
the top of this evening
but we have not.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.160
Because we're about to take
this thing to another level.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.677
Because the band of brothers I'm
about to bring to this stage

22:52.120 --> 22:54.588
comes straight out
of Motor City herself.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.358
He talkin' about you.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.190
If you would,
stand up on your feet

23:00.360 --> 23:03.670
and make some noise
for Detroit's own

23:03.840 --> 23:05.432
The Dramatics!

23:14.520 --> 23:16.856
You got to tell these folks that
they got to go home right now.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.016
These folks
is out here rioting.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.268
Hold on. They're doin' what?

23:19.360 --> 23:20.395
They out here rioting.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.913
Right now?
Right now.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.296
Tell these folks
they got to go home.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.469
Excuse me.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.275
We're ready, right?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.616
Listen, you boys can't
go out there tonight.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.816
What do you mean
we can't go out there?

23:28.840 --> 23:29.896
These folks is
out here rioting.

23:29.920 --> 23:30.976
You cannot go
out there tonight.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.056
We're on
the schedule, brother.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.840
We all gotta get the hell
out of Fox tonight.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.788
Now,
ladies and gentlemen,

23:37.880 --> 23:39.711
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.680
What's going on?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.672
It seems like we're all gonna
have to exit the building

23:44.840 --> 23:46.176
and head to our homes.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.839
Come on, just one song, man!
Motown's right there!

23:49.000 --> 23:51.992
This is Detroit,
we're no stranger to this.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.918
Now, the police said we have
absolutely nothing to worry about.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.598
So if you would,
just grab your things.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.033
Ma'am, grab your purse.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.315
Slowly, slowly.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.840
Exits to your left
and to your right.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.796
- Damn it!
- What the hell?

24:08.240 --> 24:09.878
We gotta go, boys.
We gotta go.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.315
I'm going on that stage.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.496
We're going on that stage,
y'all hear me?

24:12.520 --> 24:14.397
People are leaving, man.
The band's leaving.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.879
Ma'am, your purse.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.616
We won't get
another shot like this.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.640
I'm sorry.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.016
We need to get
out of here, Larry.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.712
Watch your step, sir!

24:23.480 --> 24:25.198
Now, boys, I'm sorry.
But we've got to go.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.753
I'm sorry.
All right.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.879
Larry, I mean...

24:30.040 --> 24:31.439
What can we do?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.231
Larry, there's
nothing we can do.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.236
Another day...
Another day, man.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.437
Listen, I know
you want it bad, man.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.914
Larry, we gotta go.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.080
We gotta go.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.074
Come on.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.389
Larry!

25:04.000 --> 25:05.228
Larry.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.830
You might be a rich man

25:18.960 --> 25:22.350
With the world on a string

25:22.840 --> 25:26.515
But with all your riches

25:26.600 --> 25:30.115
You haven't got everything

25:30.280 --> 25:34.478
If you haven't got love

25:35.440 --> 25:37.635
Love

25:37.800 --> 25:42.635
If you haven't got love
Ooh, love

25:43.280 --> 25:45.032
You're lonely

25:45.280 --> 25:47.111
You're lonely

25:47.360 --> 25:49.351
So lonely

25:49.520 --> 25:51.875
Ooh, baby

25:58.840 --> 26:00.398
We were so close.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.475
Yeah, y'all looked good,
y'all sounded good.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.477
There'll be a next time.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.435
There will be.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.708
Bus driver!

26:19.080 --> 26:20.911
Hey, now! Bus driver!

26:29.320 --> 26:30.878
Hey, y'all seeing this?

26:33.520 --> 26:34.736
Clear the street.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.432
Go back to your homes now.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.517
Disperse
or you will be arrested.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.400
I say we go up to 12th Street
and be a part of this.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.717
We're working musicians, man.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.896
I can't be singing
when I'm supposed to

26:51.920 --> 26:53.717
be out there
swinging, brother.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.360
Hey, look. We're not
too far from the Algiers.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.200
Let's just go there
till all this blows over.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.793
We gotta
get off this bus!

27:03.960 --> 27:05.632
Everybody out! Let's go, now!

27:13.560 --> 27:15.790
- Come on, man!
- Sit the fuck down!

27:17.200 --> 27:18.315
I didn't do anything!

27:18.640 --> 27:19.789
I'm sorry,
I've been working

27:19.880 --> 27:21.871
straight shifts
since the riots started.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.917
Yeah, that guy you shot at
didn't make it home.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.554
Ambulance found him
bleeding out under a car.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.313
Are we sure
it's the same guy?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.391
He's the only
Virginia Park shooting today.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.277
You carry a shotgun,
he had shotgun wounds.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.998
You wanna play ballistics?

27:40.440 --> 27:42.112
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.440
That's it?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.320
What else?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.913
You shot him in the back.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.989
Right. He was...
He was running away from me.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.638
Where else do you
want me to shoot?

27:54.600 --> 27:57.990
My point was him being
no threat to you.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.995
In hindsight,
but I'm thinking,

28:02.080 --> 28:03.176
why is he running
away from me,

28:03.200 --> 28:04.792
if all he did was
steal some groceries?

28:05.120 --> 28:08.112
What if he killed somebody
in that grocery store?

28:08.280 --> 28:10.176
He's avoiding the police.
What do you assume from that?

28:10.200 --> 28:11.349
You don't assume.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.576
If he had a weapon in his
hand, that's another story.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.591
We don't shoot for robberies.

28:16.600 --> 28:20.275
Detective, you know it's
a war zone out there, right?

28:21.760 --> 28:24.911
Yeah. 10th had to shut down.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.952
They're destroying the city.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.278
We're facilitating that
with the message we send,

28:31.880 --> 28:34.792
which is that it's okay, go ahead,
burn down your houses,

28:34.960 --> 28:36.359
rob a store.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.797
It's total chaos. And...

28:40.120 --> 28:42.634
Where does that lead us
long term, Detective?

28:42.960 --> 28:44.712
All right, kid. Thank you.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.720
Anytime.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.552
I'm recommending
murder charges.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.999
You go back to work,
wait to hear from the DA.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.360
Yes, sir.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
And kid...

29:01.200 --> 29:02.428
Calm down out there.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.388
Thank you, Detective.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.795
All right?

29:11.880 --> 29:12.915
Forget it.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.150
Are you in trouble?
I'm fine, so forget it.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.316
He's doing his job,
same as you and me.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.719
Stand up. Let's go.
On your feet.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.516
Go home, now! All you
people, off the streets.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.192
Yo, we need to split up, man.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.200
I mean, the police are
going crazy out here right now.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.641
Five brothers together,
you know they gonna say we a gang.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.400
Come on, man,
we're not splitting up.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.520
Shit!

29:43.960 --> 29:45.416
Where do you think
you're going?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.396
We're going home, man.
Get off the street!

29:47.560 --> 29:48.879
Hands on the wall!

29:48.960 --> 29:50.188
- Keep them up!
- Okay!

29:50.880 --> 29:51.880
Oh, shit!

29:55.720 --> 29:56.869
Keep moving!

29:57.040 --> 29:58.176
What the hell
you talking about?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.200
Look at this mess, man!

29:59.240 --> 30:01.117
Hey, come here! You! Stop!
It's after curfew!

30:01.200 --> 30:03.696
This is the Detroit Police.
There is a curfew.

30:03.720 --> 30:04.720
We're going home!

30:04.800 --> 30:06.313
Assalamu alaikum,
my brother!

30:06.400 --> 30:07.536
Disperse!

30:07.560 --> 30:09.312
Leave using the streets
behind you.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.628
This direction!

30:12.400 --> 30:13.799
This is our street!

30:13.960 --> 30:15.916
Go back to your homes!

30:16.120 --> 30:17.633
Go back to your homes!

30:22.320 --> 30:23.536
Disperse

30:23.560 --> 30:24.834
or you will be arrested.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.429
Hello, hello.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.560
Hello.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.909
How you doing?
Just need to get a room.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.720
Y'all at the
wrong hotel, though.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.758
Ritz down the street.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.096
Yeah, well, the Ritz ain't got
you behind the counter, so...

30:59.120 --> 31:01.873
Look, all I got
is a room in the annex

31:01.960 --> 31:03.336
out back down
through the breezeway.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.476
$11 a night,
you pay in advance.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.834
That's cool.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.711
A8, A8.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.475
Voilà!

32:14.560 --> 32:15.879
What you expect for 11 bucks?

32:24.920 --> 32:25.955
Hey!

32:26.120 --> 32:28.016
With the exception
of a few isolated snipers...

32:28.040 --> 32:30.110
You know
what fucking time it is, boy?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.430
- Let me have a little fun with you.
- Come on, man!

32:32.520 --> 32:34.096
- What time is it?
- I ain't got no watch.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.336
How am I supposed to know
what time it is?

32:35.360 --> 32:37.016
It's past curfew
and you know it, Goddamn it!

32:37.040 --> 32:38.456
You gonna shoot me
because I don't have a watch?

32:38.480 --> 32:39.536
Get the fuck off my street!

32:39.560 --> 32:41.710
What you gonna do? Shoot me?
Get off my street!

32:41.800 --> 32:42.800
Do it! Go ahead.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.016
I will kill you
right the fuck now.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.314
So sorry!

32:45.440 --> 32:48.034
I'm guarding that grocery store
right there. I'm guarding it.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.873
This my nephew.
I'm so sorry, I apologize.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.235
I'm gonna take him away.
Come on.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.719
I ain't your nephew,
motherfucker!

32:54.800 --> 32:57.553
Just get across the street.
Calm down.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.393
They let you out, Uncle Tom?
Just get across the street.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.191
Keep on walking.
Don't look back.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.599
Keep on moving.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.673
Dumb jacky giant,

33:07.760 --> 33:10.228
I'll beat your head
to the white meat.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.392
You won't kick my ass.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.313
I'm a black belt in karate,
I'll whoop that ass.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.470
Besides,
even if you did win,

33:19.160 --> 33:21.594
those ten guys over there
would be on you

33:21.760 --> 33:23.751
and behind them is 10,000.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.674
Now, you smart. Go home.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.839
So you the cool brother, huh?

33:39.840 --> 33:41.114
Dismukes.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.473
Okay, Tom.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.776
This is the Detroit Police.

33:48.800 --> 33:49.949
There is a curfew.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.872
You cannot stay on the street.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.030
What the hell was that?

33:55.640 --> 33:57.153
You checked
the windows and doors?

33:57.240 --> 33:59.435
I checked them already.
Check it again.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.556
I don't even wanna see
graffiti back there.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.680
Hello.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.110
Everything is fine.
No trouble here.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.034
I'll sleep when they stop
rioting. Good night, sir.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.550
Hey, hey.
Hey. Look at this.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.911
Miller, with me.
Ready, Title 32? Let's do it!

34:32.080 --> 34:33.308
You got it!

34:33.560 --> 34:34.675
You know what?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.469
I'm gonna go talk
to those white guys.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.710
I'm gonna stay here,
if that's okay.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.393
I'm gonna make sure they
don't start shooting at us.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.319
All right, boys.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.195
Relax here.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.416
Hey, you sure
you want them white boys

34:50.440 --> 34:52.040
to know where we are?
I'll be right back.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.189
Jefferson, Wood, head
in there and take the roof.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
We're on it.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.919
Hey, fellas.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.519
Melvin Dismukes.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.075
I'm with United Security,

35:13.200 --> 35:15.160
I'm guarding that grocery
store across the street.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.078
I come bearing gifts.
Oh.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.309
Thank you.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.874
Isn't this nice, boys?

35:25.280 --> 35:27.555
All things considered,
this is pretty good.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.632
Thank you. I don't have
my usual appliances.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.553
You got any sugar?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.552
Oh, don't push it, man.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.120
It's good
to have some quiet.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.397
We were at Black Bottom
earlier today.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.592
We actually took sniper fire.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.110
Had one, right by here.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.994
Ain't no snipers here, man.
Just you and me

35:51.160 --> 35:53.230
and the people
partying in that motel.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.955
How long do you think
this is gonna last?

35:56.120 --> 36:01.319
Yeah, how long till these
negros, people, quit?

36:01.600 --> 36:02.749
What do you think?

36:03.440 --> 36:05.237
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

36:06.080 --> 36:07.672
Is Morris home? It's Larry.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.836
I can't find
those guys anywhere.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.911
No, no, no. No, he's fine.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.353
Just when you see that cat,
tell him to come down to the Algiers.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.919
We're rehearsing.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.080
Bye.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.749
No luck?

36:24.320 --> 36:26.276
His mama don't even know
where he is.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.273
He's probably all right.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.952
Look in my eyes

36:37.120 --> 36:38.872
And don't you see water?

36:39.040 --> 36:41.998
And it's all
because of you

36:42.800 --> 36:44.279
So look at me

36:44.360 --> 36:46.271
I ain't acting like
I ought to

36:46.440 --> 36:49.273
And it's all
because of you

36:50.520 --> 36:53.717
So look in my eyes
And don't you see water?

36:53.880 --> 36:56.030
And it's all
because of you

36:56.200 --> 36:58.634
You're gonna
get back on that stage.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.311
Yeah, it's not
that simple, brother.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.315
Listen, when they hear
you blow... Money raining.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.473
And I want a cut.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.309
Look at me.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.309
In the eyes.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.631
I'm looking at you
in the eyes, Fred.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.709
You're gonna
get a record deal.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.353
All right?

37:26.160 --> 37:27.832
Look in my eyes

37:28.880 --> 37:30.313
The Fox Theatre

37:30.760 --> 37:32.876
welcomes The Dramatics!

37:33.760 --> 37:34.760
Yeah?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.194
Yeah.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.034
You know what, Fred?

37:41.200 --> 37:43.320
I think it's time to fix
that little problem of yours.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.919
What problem?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.355
I don't have a problem.
Yeah, you do. Come on.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.511
We're not doing this.
Yeah, we're doing this.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.800
Come on! Don't give me a no.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.880
Come on.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.056
You're gonna look
in her eyes

37:53.080 --> 37:54.176
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.240
And she's gonna
get you off

37:55.280 --> 37:56.349
Come on.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.349
Okay, no. Man,
I'm doing you a favor, okay?

38:01.040 --> 38:02.189
Okay?
I'm going.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.280
We're going.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.238
Look at this
nice little scene right here.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.191
There you go, Karen.
Thank you.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.238
Enjoy it because
we are now officially broke.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.476
There's rioting outside, and I'm
not writing to my parents again.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.950
Look at this.
That right there.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.520
It's perfect.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.788
Larry.
What?

38:26.960 --> 38:28.234
They white.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.594
So, they white.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.876
Beggars can't
be choosers, all right?

38:33.920 --> 38:35.148
What does that mean?

38:35.240 --> 38:36.240
You know what I say?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.320
What?

38:38.280 --> 38:39.759
Let freedom ring.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.229
I've had that freedom,
thank you very much!

38:43.400 --> 38:44.799
No, you haven't.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.799
Because freedom doesn't mean
giving it away for free.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.998
Only you could make
prostitution sound high class.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.509
Come on.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.158
I'm not trying
to do this, brother.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.320
Hey, stop.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.840
Why won't you just
leave them alone?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.592
I think those boys
are eyeballing us.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.915
Okay, stop.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.070
Come on, man.
Follow my lead.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.990
Okay, so we do it together
and it's like a co-op.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.198
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Larry Cleveland.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.432
I wouldn't be interrupting a private
conversation here, would I?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.272
We must be neighbors.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.317
I'm Julie, Ohio.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.110
Karen, Ohio.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.957
No,
my last name is Cleveland.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.596
We're actually from Ohio.

39:31.960 --> 39:34.155
Okay, so what y'all
doing in Detroit?

39:34.320 --> 39:36.470
Well, Julie here
is a professional prostitute.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.511
Okay...
She's kidding!

39:39.640 --> 39:40.789
I'm a hairdresser.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.951
And a hoe.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.037
What do you guys do?

39:47.800 --> 39:49.472
I'm a singer
in The Dramatics,

39:49.640 --> 39:51.551
and Fred here is my bodyguard.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.755
The Dramatics?

39:52.840 --> 39:53.875
Yeah.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.075
Never heard of them.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.315
But I love... I love Motown.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.071
The Supremes are my favorite.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.998
Well, if you love
The Supremes,

40:04.080 --> 40:06.036
you'll definitely love
The Dramatics.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.869
Larry.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.913
Sing something to her.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.395
Baby

40:15.320 --> 40:17.993
I'm for real

40:18.520 --> 40:22.149
I said I'm as real
As real can get

40:24.160 --> 40:26.230
Oh, my God!
You can really sing.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.269
It's who I am,
you know. I sing.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.353
It's who he is.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.515
We were just gonna go
get something to eat.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.715
A friend of ours
is staying at the annex.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.359
Would you like to join us?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.832
I mean, yeah. I could eat.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.234
Fred, you hungry?

40:46.040 --> 40:47.951
Yeah, I can eat.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
Let's go.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.029
Let's go.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.635
How you doing?

40:56.720 --> 40:57.755
Good.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.799
How are you?

41:09.480 --> 41:10.754
Mmm...

41:11.040 --> 41:12.678
We looking good!

41:12.880 --> 41:14.711
Hey, Carl!
Mmm.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.959
We're starving.

41:19.160 --> 41:20.456
You know I got something
for y'all to eat.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.549
Okay.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.438
Hey, babe.
Hey!

41:23.760 --> 41:24.760
Mmm.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.549
Hello!

41:29.080 --> 41:30.080
Hi, guys!

41:31.400 --> 41:32.549
Come on in.

41:35.680 --> 41:36.954
It's a nice joint, man.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.588
Sit down, man.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Say what?

41:42.760 --> 41:44.239
Sit down, take a seat.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.749
Hey, Aubrey.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.919
How you doing?

41:50.080 --> 41:51.308
Hey, Karen.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.519
Okay, where I grew up,
when you meet someone new,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.639
you're supposed
to say "Hi, hello!"

42:07.680 --> 42:09.193
"How are you?"

42:09.720 --> 42:11.199
It makes them
feel comfortable.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.873
Nice duds, man.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.793
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.757
We were performing earlier.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
Watch out.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.793
Total bull.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.791
This guy. Okay.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.396
Food is served
right there.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.075
Yeah, all right, man.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.719
Hey, Julie,

42:34.800 --> 42:37.075
the air conditioning's
real nice over here.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.315
Real nice, huh?

42:38.440 --> 42:40.158
Mmm-hmm.
The bed's comfortable, too.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.150
Yeah, that's nice.
Yeah?

43:07.840 --> 43:09.956
Maybe roll up
one of these joints.

43:21.760 --> 43:24.149
Aubrey, man,
turn that radio up.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.709
Come on, fellas, please.

43:51.560 --> 43:54.120
Can we please let Trane speak?

43:54.520 --> 43:56.158
What the hell?

44:08.800 --> 44:10.313
That's beautiful.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.711
So sad that he died.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.478
He was young, right?

44:15.640 --> 44:16.640
He was 40.

44:17.640 --> 44:18.914
But he used his years.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.280
Let me tell you,
that man lived.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.198
Unfortunately, it was heroin.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.909
Now, we know Trane
did not overdose.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.839
Don't put a rumor
on that, man.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.991
I didn't say Trane overdosed.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.435
But John Coltrane was a junkie
for years.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.195
Love Supreme Trane
was high on dope.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.856
I'm not saying
that's taking anything away

44:38.880 --> 44:40.136
from the man
as a spiritual example.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.559
He's one of my many saints.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.273
But heroin
is what killed his liver.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.710
I heard the FBI poisoned him.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.518
FBI. You wanna know
how I know?

44:48.680 --> 44:50.750
John Coltrane's wife
is a Detroit musician,

44:51.080 --> 44:52.274
same set as me.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.000
Oh, so now you a trained
expert on Coltrane?

44:58.120 --> 45:00.031
Continuing coverage tonight

45:00.120 --> 45:01.792
of the rioting
here in Detroit.

45:01.960 --> 45:05.111
The National Guard
has been called in

45:05.280 --> 45:09.239
and more than 3,200 people have
been arrested, most of them negros.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.755
Updates will continue
throughout our broadcast...

45:11.840 --> 45:13.671
Why is everything
always so violent?

45:15.640 --> 45:17.278
You ask your people that?

45:18.480 --> 45:20.630
Try a little revolution
with the English,

45:20.800 --> 45:23.598
all that "liberty or death"?

45:23.760 --> 45:25.955
That ain't
so non-violent at all.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.753
Man, she from Ohio.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.230
I highly doubt she understands your
logic about liberty and death.

45:34.280 --> 45:35.696
Well, let's put it
in layman's terms.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.994
Slide over, stripes.

45:38.640 --> 45:39.640
You see,

45:40.640 --> 45:42.153
you white, ain't you?

45:42.360 --> 45:43.395
Brother.

45:43.480 --> 45:44.595
You white, right?

45:45.840 --> 45:47.160
See, y'all don't
have to deal with

45:47.280 --> 45:48.640
the police nearly
as much as we do.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.472
Unless, of course,
you're some

45:50.600 --> 45:52.955
Uncle Tom handkerchief head,
you know?

45:53.120 --> 45:54.976
It's like... When you're
black, it's almost like

45:55.000 --> 45:57.150
having a gun pointing
right at your face.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.634
You understand that?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
It's like this.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.992
Hey, boy!
Get your hands off my plate.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.317
Put the hot dog...
Step away from the mustard!

46:09.480 --> 46:13.109
Put your hands down!
Don't... You nervous?

46:13.480 --> 46:15.675
- You're making me nervous!
- You got a gun on me.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.115
This like police brutality
or something, man.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.919
Oh. Oh... So you gonna tell me
how to do my job now?

46:21.040 --> 46:23.156
I'm not... So now you're
the police officer

46:23.240 --> 46:25.231
that tells me how to do my job
on my street?

46:25.320 --> 46:27.117
What you doing
on my street, nigger?

46:27.360 --> 46:30.193
See, that's the way they like
to express themselves.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.471
You know, "My street,
my house, my car."

46:32.680 --> 46:34.336
That way they can take
everything from you.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.873
Larry.
So again.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.715
What you doing
on my street, boy?

46:38.880 --> 46:40.677
Did I do something
wrong, officer?

46:41.800 --> 46:43.791
Did you do something wrong?

46:44.560 --> 46:46.869
I ought to blow
your head right off.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.038
Get that gun off me, man.

46:49.880 --> 46:51.791
Or what, boy?
I said, get that gun off...

46:53.720 --> 46:54.720
Oh, my God!

46:54.840 --> 46:57.308
Oh, my God!
You shot him! Carl!

46:58.520 --> 46:59.714
Lee!

46:59.840 --> 47:01.240
He shouldn't
have made a move.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.120
Lee?

47:10.400 --> 47:11.913
Hot dog, please!

47:15.000 --> 47:16.399
- You're nuts!
- What?

47:17.240 --> 47:18.912
- Oh, man!
- You're nuts!

47:19.680 --> 47:20.829
You're nuts!

47:21.920 --> 47:24.115
It was just a starter pistol.
It just starts races.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.200
It don't kill nobody,

47:25.240 --> 47:26.600
- it don't hurt nobody.
- Crazy!

47:27.240 --> 47:29.754
I'm just demonstrating
white power.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.353
So am I, honey.

47:31.520 --> 47:34.114
Sweetheart, baby,
it was just a joke.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.352
Y'all can go
and get the hell out,

47:36.440 --> 47:38.192
you and your partner.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.032
Thought they could
take a joke.

47:44.520 --> 47:45.919
I'm performing.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.591
Sorry, Larry,
they're usually nice guys.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.950
No, come on. Don't let
those fools bother you.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.634
Why don't we all go to my room
and relax for a little bit?

47:54.800 --> 47:56.631
We told a friend
we'd drop by.

47:56.920 --> 47:57.955
Maybe later.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.709
Come on.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.638
Find me later.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.269
See you!

48:05.400 --> 48:06.913
I thought
everybody should know.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.136
But you scared them off, man.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.718
But Karen though...

48:09.800 --> 48:11.233
She was looking at me.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.629
Karen wasn't looking at you.
Karen was feeling me, man.

48:13.760 --> 48:16.672
She was like, "Hey, Aubrey!"
I was like, "Hey, Karen!"

48:16.760 --> 48:19.433
Disperse or you will be arrested.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.309
Julie!

48:22.600 --> 48:24.989
We should teach
these pigs a lesson.

48:25.720 --> 48:27.278
What you
talking about, Carl?

48:27.960 --> 48:29.598
Them right down there.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.976
You know
if you shoot them,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.360
they're gonna
shoot us back, right?

48:37.960 --> 48:39.680
How they gonna know
where it came from, Lee?

48:39.840 --> 48:41.256
It's not even possible.
Just calm down, man.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.280
Man, you chicken.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.496
It's already crazy
in here enough.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.238
Look.
They need to understand

48:45.320 --> 48:46.816
that they can't be picking
on us all the time.

48:46.840 --> 48:47.936
Y'all gotta be
with the program!

48:47.960 --> 48:49.056
We're gonna
get our asses beat!

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
One, two.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
Would you...

48:51.280 --> 48:53.191
Get down! Hit the deck!

48:54.320 --> 48:55.435
You guys okay?

48:55.600 --> 48:57.120
Who's shooting?
From down there, maybe?

48:58.800 --> 49:00.320
It could be
any one of those buildings.

49:00.440 --> 49:02.158
Did you just hear
that gunshot, baby?

49:02.320 --> 49:04.197
No, I didn't hear anything.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.955
Anyway, you know
if I get a record deal,

49:08.040 --> 49:09.320
we gonna drive
a Cadillac, right?

49:10.640 --> 49:12.198
Look, check him out!

49:14.480 --> 49:15.879
Run, Mr. Cracker, run!

49:17.640 --> 49:18.675
Get down!

49:18.840 --> 49:19.875
Muzzle flash!

49:20.040 --> 49:22.713
By the Algiers,
could be a sniper.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.118
Mike?
I'm okay!

49:27.280 --> 49:28.872
I didn't get hit!

49:37.560 --> 49:39.440
Keifer Command, this is
Warrant Officer Roberts.

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
Take cover!

49:40.560 --> 49:41.696
Army taking sniper fire.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.154
Algiers Motel vicinity,
on Virginia Park.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.033
Yeah, keep running.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.840
- That was bad, brother.
- That's crazy, man.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.040
Now everybody know
what it's like to be black.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.016
Police 2-4, potential sniper

49:57.040 --> 49:58.200
in the area.
Army taking fire.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.912
Near the Algiers Motel

50:00.040 --> 50:01.871
on Virginia Park.
Sniper on the roof.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.759
Sniper fire, sniper fire,
Virginia Park.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.911
Sniper
fire near the Algiers Motel.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.433
10-4, on the way.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.233
Shots fired,
Virginia Park, sniper on the roof.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.112
Sniper out there!

50:22.760 --> 50:24.079
Lock the whole place up!

50:25.760 --> 50:27.432
Let's find that motherfucker.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.800
Anyway, my boy Fred
was just telling me

50:34.880 --> 50:36.216
that the rioting
is getting so bad,

50:36.240 --> 50:38.913
even Ford's thinking about
shutting down assembly for a day.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.229
Larry, that's terrible.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.440
Yeah, I know it is.

50:41.600 --> 50:43.238
Maybe we should
make the most of it.

50:43.400 --> 50:46.198
In a time of hate, love does
become more important.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.952
Maybe the most important.

50:48.120 --> 50:49.616
Why don't you come over here
and visit me?

50:49.640 --> 50:50.936
We got a swimming pool
and I think

50:50.960 --> 50:52.791
we need to spend
some time together.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.389
My mom says
I can't leave the house.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.913
But I want to.

50:58.440 --> 51:00.556
Your mama, right.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.536
- Give me some shells.
- Here.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.629
Thanks.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.136
Move, move, move!
Move forward!

51:32.520 --> 51:34.158
Left hand, top window!

51:34.240 --> 51:35.560
Spread out to the side!

51:37.160 --> 51:39.674
Hey, y'all, there's a bunch
of police outside right now.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.509
Quit playing, man!

51:43.680 --> 51:45.591
Why would I be playing?

51:45.760 --> 51:47.193
Yo, is they lost?

51:47.360 --> 51:48.400
Come on, move!

51:48.480 --> 51:50.277
I hope so!
What you mean? I don't know.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.496
I don't know, man,
but it look like

51:51.520 --> 51:52.776
they coming
right toward the house.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.360
Go! Don't just
stand there! Move up!

51:57.280 --> 51:58.349
Get in position!

52:01.800 --> 52:03.518
- Close the windows!
- Window!

52:03.720 --> 52:06.154
Hide everything!
Turn the lights off!

52:07.320 --> 52:08.320
Sniper!

52:09.720 --> 52:11.119
Oh, shit!

52:12.160 --> 52:13.176
Baby,
did you hear that?

52:13.200 --> 52:14.394
They're shooting at us!

52:20.800 --> 52:22.233
I gotta go!
They're shooting us.

52:22.840 --> 52:23.875
Larry!

52:24.960 --> 52:26.075
Fred, you good?

52:30.760 --> 52:31.760
You good?

52:32.800 --> 52:34.233
I don't wanna die, man!

52:35.480 --> 52:36.616
We gotta get out of here!

52:36.640 --> 52:38.376
- Man, don't get up!
- Carl, stay down!

52:38.400 --> 52:40.391
- They can't do this to us.
- Stay down!

52:40.560 --> 52:41.913
They can't do this to us.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.160
- Carl, stay down!
- What're you doing, man?

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
Here we go!

52:49.000 --> 52:50.228
Go. Go. Go. Go.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.111
Going up.

53:15.960 --> 53:16.960
Clear!

53:21.920 --> 53:23.114
Clear!

53:29.800 --> 53:30.949
Police!

53:42.480 --> 53:43.708
Hey, do you hear that?

53:44.120 --> 53:45.473
Fred, stay low!

54:00.840 --> 54:02.068
Police! Get on the floor!

54:02.160 --> 54:03.720
Get the fuck
against the wall right now!

54:05.120 --> 54:06.155
All right, all right!

54:06.320 --> 54:07.548
I didn't do nothing!

54:11.840 --> 54:12.976
Have you got a weapon?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.136
I don't have
a fucking gun!

54:14.160 --> 54:15.680
Put your hands
behind your back!

54:16.840 --> 54:18.239
Have you got a firearm?
No!

54:18.320 --> 54:19.753
Have you got a fucking weapon?

54:26.440 --> 54:27.919
Go, go, go!

54:28.080 --> 54:29.600
Come here! Come on!
Why you doing this?

54:30.360 --> 54:32.476
Get him the fuck
downstairs now.

54:33.960 --> 54:36.016
- Get the fuck out of here now!
- Get out of here!

54:36.040 --> 54:37.320
- Come on!
- Take him!

54:57.720 --> 55:00.792
Put your hands on your head
and relax. Just calm down.

55:01.040 --> 55:03.349
Sit down.
Put your hands on your head.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.397
Move the fuck downstairs! Go!

55:05.560 --> 55:08.199
I don't have a gun!
Don't pull, man!

55:09.480 --> 55:11.357
Police! Put your hands
on your head!

55:12.320 --> 55:13.355
They already are.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.833
Against the walls and doors!

55:27.000 --> 55:28.200
All of them! Against the wall!

55:28.240 --> 55:29.309
Fred!

55:29.720 --> 55:30.755
Walls and doors!

55:30.920 --> 55:32.399
I didn't do nothing!

55:32.560 --> 55:34.073
I don't have nothing!

55:37.760 --> 55:39.432
I don't got no gun!

55:44.840 --> 55:46.034
Anybody in there?

55:46.200 --> 55:47.349
No, sir.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.078
Get the fuck up! Get up!

55:51.280 --> 55:52.280
Get downstairs! Go!

55:52.880 --> 55:54.920
Get him downstairs!
What's going...

55:56.360 --> 55:57.759
What're you doing here?

56:01.040 --> 56:02.600
Down on
the ground! Get down!

56:02.960 --> 56:05.110
- I'm not resisting!
- Get up!

56:10.920 --> 56:13.559
Yeah, keep goin'!
Don't look at me!

56:14.040 --> 56:16.600
Against the wall,
bring them all down!

56:17.240 --> 56:18.878
Hey! You got him?

56:19.560 --> 56:20.616
Against
the walls and doors!

56:20.640 --> 56:22.456
Turn around
and stay against the wall.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.118
Let's get them
down here!

56:26.040 --> 56:27.040
Let's go!

56:27.400 --> 56:29.118
Don't you fucking move!

56:31.800 --> 56:33.711
Get them, go!
What did we do?

56:34.160 --> 56:35.520
You better
shut your mouth!

56:35.560 --> 56:37.480
Get them! Get
the fuck... Get out of here!

56:37.560 --> 56:38.959
Get the fuck downstairs!

56:51.920 --> 56:53.990
Go! Let's get them
down here!

56:56.160 --> 56:57.616
Go!
Down the stairs! Let's go!

56:57.640 --> 56:59.000
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay!

57:00.520 --> 57:02.988
Come on, man!
My arm, man! Stop!

57:03.160 --> 57:04.479
We didn't even do anything!

57:05.520 --> 57:06.555
Shit!

57:12.280 --> 57:13.508
Where's Carl, man?

57:17.200 --> 57:18.599
Where's Carl?

57:19.120 --> 57:20.189
What happened?

57:21.640 --> 57:23.596
Fella here had a knife,
tried to go for my gun.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.751
Yeah, I heard him shout,
"Get off my gun!"

57:26.280 --> 57:28.157
Yeah, it all happened
pretty fast.

57:30.360 --> 57:32.032
I guess you had
to defend yourself.

57:33.880 --> 57:34.949
Aubrey, get back!

57:36.360 --> 57:38.828
Get back
against the wall! Move!

57:39.840 --> 57:42.638
Chill!
They killed Carl!

57:42.800 --> 57:44.677
Don't be stupid, boy!
Stay against the wall!

57:44.840 --> 57:45.875
Okay, okay.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.760
He has his face filled
with blood. They killed him, man.

57:53.120 --> 57:55.395
Shame.
A young kid like that.

57:58.240 --> 58:01.550
Still, he might be the shooter.
We need to find out.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.640
They killed him, man.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.911
They killed our friend.

58:19.240 --> 58:20.912
What's the deal
with the girls?

58:21.080 --> 58:22.880
I found them with the
big nigger down the end.

58:22.920 --> 58:23.989
Same room?

58:30.680 --> 58:32.193
You find anything?
Nothing.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.320
No gun?

58:33.400 --> 58:34.400
No.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.919
Some bad news.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.393
One of the guests is dead.

58:51.720 --> 58:54.109
He tried to take
a police officer's weapon,

58:54.600 --> 58:56.192
ended up getting shot.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.508
Carl Cooper.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.714
He killed Carl.

59:09.080 --> 59:10.593
May he rest in peace. Amen.

59:10.760 --> 59:11.795
Amen.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.316
Now let's not be stupid
in this situation.

59:19.560 --> 59:22.791
We still have a crime scene
here and you're all suspects.

59:23.440 --> 59:24.793
Each and every one of you.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.912
Don't look at me!

59:27.120 --> 59:29.111
Turn around, face the wall!

59:36.960 --> 59:38.837
Was Carl the one
doing the shooting?

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
Huh?

59:47.240 --> 59:49.117
Somebody better start
getting honest with me.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.108
Hey! I want that gun!

59:55.320 --> 59:56.656
We looked around,
we didn't find a gun.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.796
Doesn't mean
it's not here! Go find it!

59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.514
You, too!

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.831
I got nothing
against you people.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.680
But you need to tell me
where the gun is.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.352
You need to tell me

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.831
who was doing the shooting.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.996
I'm only gonna ask
so many times.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.998
Who did the shooting?

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160
We don't know.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.713
You do fucking know!

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.998
You were upstairs,
who was doing the shooting?

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.176
Who was doing the shooting?
You doing the shooting, man!

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.349
Lee!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
No, man.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.877
Carl ain't got no gun.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320
What's that?

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.038
You're the ones out here
killing people!

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.716
Say that to my face!

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.393
I said, Carl ain't shoot
nobody, man!

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.232
Yeah, all right.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.389
Fuck.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.310
Stop your goddamn crying!
Face the door!

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.198
You, too. Face the front!

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.670
Why don't you pick that up
and defend yourself?

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.429
Hmm?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.512
It's easy, look.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.552
You sure you don't wanna
try and stab me?

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.953
I'm not gonna play your game.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.195
Come on.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.192
That would just give me
an excuse to do

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.111
what we both know
is gonna happen anyway.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.555
Right?

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.192
Man, y'all
some crazy crackers!

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.277
Shit!

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.839
Get off of me.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.711
You still a cracker.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.030
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Shut up.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.310
There's a goddamn
shooter in this house.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.959
Was it Carl?

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.158
Let me tell you something.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.836
If you think that you can
shoot at innocent people

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.069
and get away with it,

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.598
you are dead wrong.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.074
My partner said, "stand up."

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.037
Look, I'll take him.
So stand.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.856
Go search the place,
I'll take him with me.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.677
Come on, come on.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.751
Come on.
Get the fuck outta here.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.712
I got all night, people.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.477
Nobody's gonna talk?

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.032
Nobody knows
who the shooter is?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.479
Please, God. Please, God.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.039
Nobody's going to admit shit?

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.509
All right.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.677
Then start prayin'.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.470
Start praying. What's the
matter, boy? You don't pray?

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.792
You don't go
to fuckin' church?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.997
- Start praying!
- Oh, Lord.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.376
Forgive our trespasses as we forgive
those that trespass against us.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.311
'Cause I will
kill you, one by one,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.870
until you tell me exactly
what is going on here.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.871
Cover us with
the blood of Jesus, God.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.199
I'm just gonna assume
you're all criminals.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.158
Because if we're honest,
you probably are.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.239
So let's hear it.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.072
Let's fucking hear it!

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.391
Pray! Do it loud!

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.551
You don't sing
that gospel shit?

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.912
My way

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.216
There you go,
now we got two of 'em.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.456
Take the hate out
of our hearts, God.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.549
What about you?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.994
Your grace is with me

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.913
You are not praying. I'm not
hearing shit out of you.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.896
- Mary, full of grace...
- I don't give a fuck.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.514
You may need a little fuckin'
help to know how to pray.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.355
You are near me

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.320
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.919
When my life

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.599
He's really fuckin' praying.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.034
It's not bad.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.759
All right, check the room.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.758
Under the beds
and in the drawers. Okay?

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.793
They're gonna kill us, man.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.630
Why? You gonna be crazy?

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.471
They the ones
that's acting crazy.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.119
They lost they mind
when they seen

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.080
a couple white girls
in a room with a black man.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.077
They're lookin' for
a sniper, okay?

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.030
But Carl wasn't
no sniper, man.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.868
So if a guy goes for your gun,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.791
you gonna let him have it
because he's black?

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.029
Come on!

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.789
A cop has a shotgun
like yours, right?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.991
You hold that tight
with two hands.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.991
How you even gonna
try to take that?

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.833
Lotta ways.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.320
There's no guns
in this whole motel

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.271
except the ones
these cops brought.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.593
There's no guns.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.635
We takin' something
for those crazy boys.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.833
Pick 'em up.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.792
What's the point?

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.274
Look, I understand. Okay?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.036
But don't antagonize
those guys.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.711
I need you
to survive the night.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.799
Survive the night.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.713
All right?

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.376
You don't think
you're gonna talk?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.719
I'll fucking make you talk.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880
Where's the fuckin' gun?

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.551
Get up!
Get the fuck up!

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.776
You gonna tell me
where the gun is?

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.711
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.791
Stop fucking lying to me!

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.473
Where's the fucking gun!

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.440
I swear to God,
I'll pull the fucking trigger!

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560
Where is it?

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.216
I don't know,
I swear...

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.240
Bullshit!

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.395
Come here.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.595
What's going on?

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.154
I gotta tell you, Detroit PD
is going nuts in there.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.389
What do you mean?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.192
Looks like they're
terrorizing suspects,

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.376
beating and so forth,
trying to get a confession.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.755
Well, that's not correct,
they got their civil rights.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.989
That's what I'm saying.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.674
Don't look right to me.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.080
Where's
that fucking gun?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.758
Don't lie to me!
Where's the gun?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.068
All right.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.431
Let's let them have the case.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.275
I don't wanna get involved in any
civil rights mix-up, you know?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.073
Let's go.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.712
Where's the fucking gun!
I don't know!

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.030
Bullshit!
You people are always lying!

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.235
Who's the shooter?

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.915
Find it?

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.115
No.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.113
All this looks stolen.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.912
I searched
the whole room, myself.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.112
He wouldn't even
tell you, huh?

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.630
All right.
Get Demens to watch the line.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.949
Come with me.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.912
Get in there. Quickly.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.200
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Lie down.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.752
Come on!
We need you in here.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400
Get the...

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.471
Get on the goddamn floor.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.551
You don't have to
do this, man.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.639
We're gonna hold the line.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.354
Why you gotta fuck them, huh?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.988
What's wrong with us?

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.314
Listen to me.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.953
You need to tell me

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.590
where the gun is
and who the shooter is...

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.193
I swear to you there's no gun.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.359
There's no gun, man!

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.200
...or I swear to God,
I will kill you.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.589
There's no gun, man.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960
Okay.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.519
I don't know nothing, man.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.879
No!

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.479
He shot him. He shot him.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.359
Face the fucking wall.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.630
Be still and stay quiet,

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.154
or the next one is for real.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:14.354
Understand?

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.078
This'll make 'em talk.
Watch this.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.917
That one didn't even kick.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.911
That's what happens
when you lie to us.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.435
Who else wants to kill one?

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.999
You wanna kill one?

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.828
Okay.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:43.594
All right.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.277
Officer, wait!
I didn't shoot nobody!

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.668
Officer, wait!
Shut up!

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880
Fuck!

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.520
Shut up.
Get the fuck in there.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.776
I told you I don't know where
the fucking gun is, man.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.440
You looked for it, right?
Shut your mouth!

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.397
Hey, man. You gotta tell me where
the gun is so all this can stop.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.794
Where's the gun?
I don't know.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.951
You can't do this shit!
Shut the fuck up!

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.040
Michael. Michael.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.792
You think we're bluffin'?

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.473
This is Detroit.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.353
We don't bluff.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.550
Now, be quiet,

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.710
or the next one
will be for real.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.598
I killed that nigger.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.279
There you have it.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.874
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.039
Get your goddamn hands
off her. Turn around.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.633
What's your part
in all this, huh?

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.871
Probably know
where the gun is.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.030
Probably know
who the shooter is.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.156
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.798
Yes, you do.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.108
And you're lyin' to me.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.509
Get away from me!

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.176
You think you'd get a pass
'cause you're white?

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.430
No, whore. You don't.
Find out what she knows.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.358
It's okay. Easy, easy.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.355
Face the goddamn wall.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.632
It's just you and me.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480
Take a seat.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.475
Sit down.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.748
Sit down.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.355
Ouch.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.353
You all right there, miss?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.033
Is everything okay?

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.594
You're okay though, right?

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.238
Don't touch me.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.154
Try to keep calm.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.832
What are you doin'
living here?

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.428
It's a hotel, isn't it?

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.794
Yeah.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.552
So you're up here
for a while?

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.034
Some, uh,

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.753
prostitution, maybe?

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.194
I'm visiting from Ohio.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.998
My father is a judge.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.275
And your father,
he knows you're here, right?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.157
Living amongst the blacks?

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.468
Are there black people here?

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.118
I didn't notice,
I'm colorblind.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.875
Really?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.316
What color am I? Blue?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.713
You look yellow to me, sir.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.798
You're working prostitution.
No!

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.394
Look at me.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.400
You're fuckin'
these black guys, right?

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.559
They're kids.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.949
What's the matter with you?

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.868
I'm trying
to protect you, miss.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.958
Stay there.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.915
She's a hooker.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.192
All right, fuck it.
Come here.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.591
So, you are the pimp.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.069
No, sir.
I think you're mistaken.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.278
- Fuck!
- Listen.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.839
We've got
all the time in the world.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.751
We are gonna get
to the bottom of this.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.355
So think very carefully about
how you answer our questions,

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.761
or you're gonna end up like
your friends in the next room.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.080
How long you been pimpin' out
these young girls, huh?

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.440
Destroying their bodies
and minds.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.471
I just met 'em.
I ain't pimpin'.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.993
I just got back from the war.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640
You're a veteran?

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.195
Yes, sir.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.229
Fuckin' stupid
do you think I am?

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.389
You wear army green,

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.880
you try to be
a fucking serviceman.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.355
We don't need
pimps in the army.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.836
Probably drove
a fucking supply truck.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.196
I was airborne.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.913
Look out!

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.753
Take cover!

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.313
Move to cover!

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.913
Get down! Get down!

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.472
Go, go, go!

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.151
- Take cover!
- Sniper!

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.875
Down, down!

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.475
Across the street!
They're running up Euclid!

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.016
- Three houses up.
- I see him!

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.632
Who's got eyes on him?

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.960
Don't worry about it. If it
was anything, they'd grab us.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.073
Larry, what are you doin'?

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.355
Larry.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.758
Get back on the wall.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.279
Let's get the fuck up
outta here.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.679
They're gonna
come back.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.159
We can. Let's go.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.468
No.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.760
What are you doing, man?

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.474
Come on. Come on.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.359
Fred, let's go.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.873
No, Larry. Stop.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.031
Who's got eyes on him?

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.758
Watch the roof!

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.158
Just breathe,
just breathe.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.597
It's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.799
Come on, come on.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.992
Stay the fuck away.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.756
Check all those windows!

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.912
Hold your perimeter!

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.656
They're shooting.
You hear that?

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.715
Shut up!

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.712
Fall back!
Covering fire! Put it down!

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.869
Fire! Fire!

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.709
Oh, shit!

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.835
Oh, shit!

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.440
- We got 'em!
- Hold your fire!

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.953
All right, it's clear.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.151
Snipers everywhere, tonight.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.268
Clear!

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.035
Is that your
buddies out there, huh?

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.872
Is that who was
shooting at us?

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.238
Huh? What do you gotta say?

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880
Fuck!

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.912
Says right there.
Paratrooper, eight years.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.632
Two deployments.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.029
Honorable discharge.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.630
This is a fake.
No, sir.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.236
- This your girl?
- I just met her.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.469
What's his name?

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.553
I don't know.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.993
His name is Karl Greene.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.798
I wasn't asking you,
I was asking her.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.472
You just said,
"What's his name?"

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.233
You're lucky I haven't broken
your fuckin' neck, yet.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.639
Okay.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.995
All right, man. I see
what you're trying to do.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.674
I'm not gonna cause
any trouble, okay?

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.399
But I'm not gonna
lie down for you, either.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.079
What are you doin'
in Detroit, huh?

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.914
Like everybody else,
I'm lookin' for work.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.896
Left one war zone
and joined another.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.035
Yeah.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.154
All right. Get this
motherfucker back in line.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.992
Give me back
my government card, man.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.513
Why don't you
get outta here?

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.716
Run out the back door. Run.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.079
Right now, go!

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.716
You know the one
who was praying?

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.438
He's okay, it's not him.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.272
And you can
scratch off G.I.Joe.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.040
That little twerp with
the big, fuckin' prayer.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.792
Yeah, it's not him.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.430
That leaves us with the big
motherfucker who's in that room.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.794
I like him for it.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.193
Okay.
Yeah.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.949
Flynn.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.515
Fuck!

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.673
He's escaped.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.874
Well, we need another one.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.995
I know.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.030
Still... Still no gun.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.392
So, who wants to go next?

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.349
Hmm?

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.112
Please, please, please.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.871
Please. Just, please, please.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.996
Officer, can I say something?

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.833
There we go.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.399
Yes, you can.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.836
I think you have
the wrong house.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.071
'Cause nobody we saw...

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.153
'Cause nobody we saw here
was shooting at the police.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.879
Please.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.230
It's possible
we made a mistake.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.395
But I need to know for sure.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.556
Can't let a cop killer
get away with it, can I?

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.870
Please, please.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.598
How about you, sweetheart?

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.668
You wanna be next?

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.760
- No.
- Hmm?

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.759
No, I don't, please.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.896
I think
you know something.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.955
I don't.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.056
You wanna just die now...

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.195
No.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.616
...or watch me
kill the others first?

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.200
Which one, huh? Which one?

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.350
Get her outta here. Jesus!
And her! Up!

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.555
Upstairs!

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.119
No!

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.199
Shut up!

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.998
You wanna cry, huh?

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.354
Jesus Christ!

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.668
You wanna cry?

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.976
I'll give you something
to cry about.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.800
Watch them.
This one's coming with me.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.068
Shut up!

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.776
You wanna cry, huh? I'll give
you something to cry about.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.279
Leave her alone!

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.954
I guess there are no weapons
on your person.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.589
Stay over there
and keep quiet.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.439
God.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.278
Aren't you ashamed
of yourselves?

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.078
You're the one
checking out my tits.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.912
You're having
sex with niggers.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.194
It's 1967, asshole.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.948
Honestly.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.712
It doesn't bother you?

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.518
The Afro Sheen in their hair?

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.199
The way it smells?

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.713
You're on some trip.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.438
You think you can
come into my city

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.112
and pimp out a bunch
of young girls?

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.077
I said it wasn't like that.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.276
I don't care
if you were in the army.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.828
I'll drown all you pimps in the
river until the city's clean.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.072
You gonna question them or I'm
gonna take 'em outta here.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.718
Just hold on.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520
Look.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.677
You might not be
such bad girls after all.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.997
But be straight with me.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.000
Who was shootin' at the
National Guard out there?

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.920
Mister?

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.954
I didn't see anybody shoot
at the National Guard.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.031
I would tell you if I had.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.314
You would?

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.194
You can think I'm a slut if you
want, but I was raised right.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.031
All right. I'm gonna
get 'em outta here.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.110
Let's get you
covered up, okay?

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.108
You too.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480
Come on.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.992
Hey, can I get a hand?

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.029
Fuck.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.314
Fuck those fuckers.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.736
You're fucking
murdering those kids!

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.591
Why don't you stop them?

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.628
This animal did it too.
He shot one of them!

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.456
Don't concern yourself.
They're just scaring them.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.640
It's an interrogation tactic.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.632
Are you nuts, Mister?
I saw the bodies!

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.597
Those guys are getting
murdered in cold blood.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.631
I didn't really
shoot the guy.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.956
It's not real.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.679
I didn't shoot that guy,
and neither did the other.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.718
It's to get the guys to fess up
about the location of the gun.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.955
Who said they even had a gun?

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160
I don't know.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.714
If they did, it was just a toy.
It wasn't a real gun.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.716
Well, thanks for saving us.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.949
We gotta head out.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.552
Are we safe here?

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.674
She means, are you gonna tell
the police where we are?

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.914
No.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.840
Karen.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.716
We're gonna be okay.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.518
But those boys...

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.359
Fucking stay there.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.078
You see that? See that shit?

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.151
That is your fault
right there. Look at it.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.754
You don't talk, that's
what happens. Look at it.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.748
At ease.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.318
That kid. Him.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.753
He was up there
in the same room

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.040
as those other
two delinquents.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.640
Yeah. Let's get
our confession out of him,

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.079
vacate the premises,
all right?

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.710
Okay.
Demens should do it.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.555
Do what?

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.234
You haven't
killed a nigger yet.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.398
Uh...

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.557
Well, I don't know
about that.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.913
Sure you do.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.635
What's the matter, partner?
Problem?

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.474
Whatever you say.
Which one?

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.314
Come with me. I gotta ask you
some questions.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.599
Please.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.314
Please don't
kill me, please.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.072
Please don't
shoot me, please.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.310
Where is the gun?

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.391
I don't know. Please.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.472
I don't know. I swear to God,
I don't know. Please. Please.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.118
I got no cause
to shoot you.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.656
Please don't
shoot. Please.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.908
Where's the gun?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.336
Please don't
shoot me, man.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.430
I ain't never shot
anybody before in my life.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.394
Please! I don't know
where... Please.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.878
Please, don't...

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.193
Turn around.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.272
They fucking killed him.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.191
So that's done.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.952
Good. Great job.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.837
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.718
Boy, I feel funny.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.032
Yeah. It's the right thing.
He'll talk now.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.829
What do you mean?

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.512
Another one bites the dust.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.160
I bet some of you thought
we weren't serious, huh?

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.559
Well, we still
don't have our gun

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.278
and we are running
out of time, people.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.713
Who was the sniper?

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.318
Just be honest with us
so we can all go home.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.038
You shot him, Demens.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.348
Yeah, I got him.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.314
Jesus Christ, Marty.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.016
We weren't actually
shooting the other guys.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.314
We're playing with them.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.715
What do you mean?

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120
Playing.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480
Playing what?

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.868
A game.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.278
A game to get them to talk,
scare the shit out of 'em.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.588
Interrogation tactics.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.954
Fuck.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.316
This is strictly
police business.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.875
Hey, boys,
let's move out.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.349
Have you got...
You don't have a knife.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.351
- Fuck me.
- Oh, fuck.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.509
Okay, listen. Listen.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.829
Listen to me.
Oh, fuck.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.752
He grabbed your gun,
all right,

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.520
and you warned him, okay?

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.791
And you were forced to shoot him, okay?
Line of duty.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.416
Get your fucking story straight.
Oh, fuck.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.079
Hey, get your head straight.
I'm serious.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.599
All right,
just take a minute.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.275
Stay here.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.553
Oh, God.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.709
Oh, fuck.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.754
Marty shot the guy.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.239
What?

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.389
He did?
Yeah.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.393
Point blank.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.954
We need to wrap this up
and get out of here.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.032
We don't have a suspect.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.316
Should we just
arrest them all?

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.194
No, no, not now. We just need
to get out of here, you know?

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.390
And... Us and them.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.916
If they're smart, they're not
gonna say anything, all right?

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.352
All right. Let's do this.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.993
You come with me.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.199
Listen to me.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.994
You're free to go.

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.236
But you don't talk about this
to anyone, ever.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200
You understand?

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.794
'Cause I got your name,

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.791
and I know
exactly who you are.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.995
I don't got your name.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.909
I don't know
nothin' about you.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.998
Please don't kill me.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.955
Please don't kill him.

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.672
What's this here?

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.398
I don't see nothin'.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.952
All right.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.673
Get going.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.276
Hey, we don't know nothin'.

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.833
We don't know nothin'.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.717
No, no, no, no!

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.315
Relax.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.834
Listen.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.390
What if I told you you can
run out that door right now,

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.989
but you never talk about
what you saw here?

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.519
Understand?

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.355
Please don't kill him.
Please don't kill him.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.588
No, no, no!

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.153
Listen to me.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.238
What do you see here?

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.952
You killed him.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.479
You killed him.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.797
We're gonna try this again.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.638
I don't see anything.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.315
There's a dead guy
right there.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.674
Halt!

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:15.234
Please, please, please...

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.920
Please, please, please...

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.155
Hey.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.199
Hey.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.077
Oh, my God.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.037
Who could do this
to someone?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.749
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here
to help you, all right?

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.190
Come on. Hey.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.077
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.912
All right? Relax.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.598
Okay? Hey, hey,
it's all right.

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.472
Come with me. Come on.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.551
Come on.
We're gonna get you there.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.868
Come on, brother.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.998
Don't you go on me, all right?
Come on. Come on.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.835
We got him.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.075
Let's go.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.518
Aubrey! Phone call!

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:41.840
Aubrey, hey!

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.148
You got phone call!

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.271
Say again?
You got a call from home.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.708
Something's wrong.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.597
Kid's in trouble or hurt,
or something.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.318
Bet it's my youngest.

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.155
He's always googy-googy.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.428
Yes?

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.719
Well, Aubrey,

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:14.918
they found Aubrey dead this
morning at the Algiers Motel.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.555
No. No. Aubrey's supposed
to be at home.

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.277
It's gotta be somebody else.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.998
What is this, Ma?

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.159
A mistake?

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.711
It's gotta be a mistake.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.231
Aubrey's got more sense
than that.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.312
Well, baby, you never know.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.233
Let's go see.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.555
Dismukes?

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.279
Is he there?

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.397
Looking for a Dismukes.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.634
Appreciate it.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.589
Any of you fellas
named Dismukes?

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.633
Yeah, that's me.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.678
I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.319
Is there a problem?

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.589
No. I don't think so.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.272
Rather not have
to ask again, though.

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.158
Y'all tell the boss, huh?

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.479
You got this?

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.351
- Take care of yourself.
- This way.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.431
Come on, I ain't got all day.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.034
Take a seat.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.069
I'm sorry, I...

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.909
I assume this is about
what went on at the motel?

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.511
What happened at the motel?

01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.760
If you don't know,
I'll tell you.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.077
I was working security
by Wisconsin.

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.310
And on Tuesday night,
we heard gunfire

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.039
coming from the area
near the Algiers.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.315
Oh.
In that direction.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.238
Police was there.
State police, National Guard.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.509
It was a lot of shooting.

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.399
And when I went in there,
three kids had been killed.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.629
No.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.109
Yes, sir.
This right there, right?

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.191
Is that what
you're talking about?

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.109
Yes, sir.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.315
Yeah.

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.870
He was lying just like this.
The blood was fresh.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.678
It hadn't congealed yet.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.835
So they were killed
right before you got there?

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.395
Yes, sir.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.116
You carry a.38, right?

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.555
A revolver.
Do you carry a revolver?

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.119
I do have a.38.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.397
Hmm. You ever shoot anyone?

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.789
No.
Strike anyone?

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.798
Not the way you mean, sir.
What do I mean?

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.239
Fellas,

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.197
you know, sometimes,

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.953
when a black guy's put
in a position of authority,

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.111
other black guys, they like
to single you out, okay?

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.668
Because I'm not supposed
to tell 'em what to do.

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.158
When we have
these conversations,

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.470
we do them in stages, okay?

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.155
Stage one, witnesses.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.396
Stage two, suspects.

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.552
What stage are we in?

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.000
You don't know
what stage we're in?

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.792
No. Could you
specify for me?

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.110
Yeah, we're in stage two.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.953
You're a suspect.

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.277
I didn't do it.

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.360
The police...

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.715
Ah, here we go.

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.519
The police shot those kids.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:09.790
See,
how the hell do you know that

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.030
when you weren't inside
the building

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.429
until after
the shooting stopped?

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.114
So, are you lying to us now,

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.033
or were you lying
just a minute ago?

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.120
That's
a good question, Detective.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.635
You need to think real hard.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.392
You need to answer me.

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.640
All due respect,
I am telling the truth.

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.233
I'm not lying.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.675
I told you what I saw.
I saw these kids...

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.512
Melvin.
Okay. Okay.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.670
We're here to help you, okay?
Yes, sir.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.518
Melvin, do you
wanna go home?

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.600
Yeah.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.256
Can we let him think about it?

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.919
Yeah.
You think about it, okay, Melvin?

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.752
I didn't do it.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.440
Number four, step forward.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.315
You're doing
a real good job, honey.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.233
Eddie...

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.833
Has he woken up?

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.239
No, man.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.069
Hey.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.154
Larry.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.992
Hey, wake up, brother.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.269
Hey.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.034
Be gentle.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.990
It's all right, man.
It's us.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.355
You know where
my little brother is?

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:34.232
The police are saying
Fred is dead,

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.280
but I can't get nobody
to tell me what's going on.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.434
What's going on?

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.232
You tell us, man.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.039
The police...

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.234
The police?

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.799
The police...

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.914
They...

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.397
You have children?
Oh, yes. I have three boys.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.556
The oldest is 12.
Then nine and seven.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.471
You know
how youngsters are then.

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.913
Oh, boy...

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.838
The way they communicate,
grunts and groans.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.279
My little cavemen.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.396
Especially boys.

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.536
It's like they don't know if
they wanna be slick, you know?

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.039
That's right.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.680
They're still trying
to find their place in life

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.432
and we have
to allow for that.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.669
Uh-huh.

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:49.639
Oh, yes.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.675
Hmm.

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.639
Well,

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.033
I can see
you want to go back there.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.429
Sure.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.792
We helped put out fires.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.031
We helped try to keep the riots
down and keep the corner clear.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.473
What can you say

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.279
about having all this
murdering and confusion?

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.873
Everybody isn't thieves
and murderers.

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.272
I wish that things could be
better for the negro people.

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.838
Just, uh...

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.096
Remember what I told you, and this
whole thing's gonna blow over.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.759
All right?
You did nothing wrong.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.673
I think I gotta say somethin'.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:07.832
Hey. You made...

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.509
Demens.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.036
Something that took one minute

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.429
should not define
your entire life.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.272
You understand?

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.032
You made a mistake.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.795
You say what you need to say,

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.988
and you move on.

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.117
That's how
you get out of this thing.

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.312
All right?
All right.

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.589
All right?

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.154
Yeah. You don't have to lecture
me, I know what to do.

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.639
There you go.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.112
You were doing your job.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.950
You first, knucklehead!

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.635
All right.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:32.669
Flynn!

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.080
All right. Let's go, ladies.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.917
I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.073
Well?

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.717
Some things were said
in there.

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.151
Such as?

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.632
You stupid...
You motherfucker, you're dead.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.233
You're fucking dead.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.112
You too?

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.837
We're all going down.

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.548
Phil, listen. It's...

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:46.715
No. No.
Just listen to me.

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.472
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Phil!

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.675
I got nothing to say
without my union lawyer.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.432
Are you kidding me,
you racist fuck?

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.034
Get out of the car
before I break your neck.

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.713
I couldn't say for sure who
went inside the building first.

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.709
Um...

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.279
There were five,

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.715
maybe six state police.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.837
We have complete statements
from your partners.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.868
We know you shot those kids.

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.993
So just go from there.

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.156
No. No.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.549
I don't recall
doing that. Uh...

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.960
Bang his head against
the table. Might help.

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.229
Hey.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.630
I'm trying to help here.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.672
I'm trying to be thorough.

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.073
So, you wanna know

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.071
how many state police
were on the scene,

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.599
how many National Guard?

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.076
I can't tell if you're stupid
or smart,

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.071
but I'm willing to find out.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.198
Don't say another word.

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.509
Come on.

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.679
What's the point?

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.558
Coercive testimony
will be tossed.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:27.513
Larry!

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.080
Yo, you sure he's home?

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:35.709
Give him a minute.

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:42.519
Man, what?
What's so important?

01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.272
The record company
called, baby!

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.591
They wanna hear our music
at the studio!

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.074
Oh, and they called you?

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.696
Yeah, man. They said
they tried to call you

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.920
but you never
called them back.

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.270
This is what
we've been working for, man.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.713
They wanna hear
The Dramatics!

01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.598
So what?
You Mr. Show Business now?

01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.432
This isn't professional.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.713
Call at business hours,
not 3:00 in the morning.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.394
But Larry...

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.473
Larry! It's a record company, man.
They don't keep banking hours.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.914
Come on.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.755
Listen, you guys
had better sound good

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.034
because I'm broke.

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:31.316
Let me hear that blend.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.159
Uh, yes, sir.

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.117
Are you guys ready?
Yeah.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.469
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:44.831
Look in my eyes
And don't you see water?

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.599
And it's all
because of you

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.349
Well look at me
I ain't acting like I oughta

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.637
And it's all
because of you

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.350
Ooh

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.958
Ooh

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.759
Uh, George,
can we get a minute?

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.160
- Come on.
- Yeah, hurry back.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.358
Look, what is
in your head, man?

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.656
'Cause you ain't singin'
in there.

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:22.760
How am I supposed to sing
with what happened to Fred?

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.632
Look, you just do it.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.551
Sing while my boy
is lying dead?

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.794
Look, a song ain't words
on a page, man.

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.279
That ain't music.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.634
Music is what you put into it

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:34.176
and you can make that
whatever you want.

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.475
I'm not singing so white
motherfuckers can dance!

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.640
Well, them pale motherfuckers
ain't dancing for free!

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.713
Since when do you care
if white folks dance anyway?

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.750
During the week
of rioting in Detroit,

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.308
three negros were shot
to death in a motel room.

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.516
Police and the Guardsmen
had raided the motel,

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.669
searching for snipers.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.992
Later,
witnesses to the shootings

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.150
said the three negros
had been lined up

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:12.038
and shot in cold blood
by the officers.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:14.950
Today, two police officers
were arrested

01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.519
and charged with the murders

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.795
of two of the negros
shot in the motel.

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:20.791
The officers,
one with two years' service,

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.359
the other with four

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.351
and no previous
misconduct charges,

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.237
were ordered
held without bail.

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.311
They pleaded not guilty.
Their attorney said

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.675
the arrests
were a shame and a pity.

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.518
Police Commissioner,
Ray Girardin,

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.511
refused to discuss
the facts of the case,

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.238
except to say
the two officers...

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.678
Who do you got mail for?

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.113
Larry Cleveland Reed?

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.392
Larry!

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:53.119
Larry, you got a letter.
From the government.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.072
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.955
I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't do nothin'!

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.400
- Lie down.
- Please, man!

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.596
I will kill you
one by one

01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.468
until you tell me
exactly what is going on here.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.272
Don't look at me. Turn around.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.918
Start praying!

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.672
Get down! Get up!

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.792
Get the fuck up! Get up!

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.916
Bullshit!
Stop fucking lying to me!

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.433
Carl ain't got no gun.

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:13.696
One of the guests
is dead.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.312
Please don't shoot.
Please.

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.549
Where's the gun?

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.000
Please don't shoot me,
man!

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.952
Officer,
can I say something?

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.320
I think you have
the wrong house.

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.916
In the Algiers Motel case,

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.792
both the prosecution
and the defense

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.313
in their opening statements

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.472
reminded the all-white jury
of the racial violence

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.471
that seared Detroit
two summers ago.

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.994
Now, Mr. Reed,
before the police

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.277
or military personnel
started firing,

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.318
to your knowledge, had there
been any sniper fire

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:45.710
from inside the Algiers Motel
or annex?

01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.559
No.

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.236
And did you see anyone
in the motel that night

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.833
with a gun of any kind
in their hand

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.912
outside of police officers
or military personnel?

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:02.399
I saw someone shoot a toy gun
at one of his friends.

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.759
A toy gun.

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.675
Mr. Reed.

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.033
Isn't it a fact that your head

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.111
was against the wall
for most of the evening?

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:18.793
No, sir, it is not.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.034
My hands were against the wall
for most of the evening.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.348
That's a fact.

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.509
I asked about your head.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.118
My head is attached
to my neck.

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.476
It moves. This way, and that.

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.033
And yet, it cannot
turn completely around

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.599
to see what's behind you?

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.513
Unless you have
a special skill

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.113
this courtroom
should know about?

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.790
You said you saw the flash
before you heard the gunshot.

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.152
Was that your testimony?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.638
Well, it was pretty confusing.

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:57.976
Well, which is it?
Which came first?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.228
Did you see the flash?

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:01.276
When did you hear the body
hit the floor?

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.429
I can't say for sure.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.829
You said you were
just outside the door.

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.673
You also said
you might be confused,

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.352
that you don't know
what point in time

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.440
these things happened.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.676
So, are you confused?

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:14.816
I saw the flash,
just through the door.

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.239
What I need to know is,

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.833
did you see Aubrey Pollard

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.751
make a threatening move
toward my client?

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.355
Or are you perhaps confused
on that point as well?

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.188
Yes, sir.

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:34.836
Being a military man,

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.598
you would be able
to distinguish

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.557
between the uniforms
of a National Guardsman

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:41.200
and that of a Detroit police officer.
Is that correct?

01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.759
I suppose.

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:43.955
And so you say

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:46.176
that the man who took one of
the victims into the room,

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.270
that he was
a National Guardsman?

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:49.918
So I presume
you know that because

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.275
he was wearing a uniform
of the National Guard.

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:55.557
Well, yes. I saw a guy in
uniform take him back there.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.669
Did you see anybody else
go back into that room?

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:00.674
No.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.316
Would you have been
able to see

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.550
if anybody else
went back into that room?

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.916
At the time, wasn't your head
turned back around

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.115
by the police officers

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.792
that were still
standing there with you?

01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.469
Yes.

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.553
And so in one of the lineups,

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:20.074
when you were asked to identify
the officers who beat you,

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.559
who did you identify?

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:24.234
Do you see him
here today in court?

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.035
Him.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.674
And him.

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:33.914
You just identified
two of the defendants.

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.351
Why would you identify
only one of them

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.515
at the time of the lineup

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.636
if both of them took part
in beating you?

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.591
Which recollection
for the record

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.360
would you say
is the correct recollection?

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.072
I just said
I couldn't tell at first.

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.376
When I went down to the police
station, I was very nervous.

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:49.755
And so now, you are calm?

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.680
And you will not be changing
your story again then?

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.096
This is it? This is the one
you want us to work with?

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.348
Objection. Asked and answered.

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:57.668
Overruled.

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:00.752
So you were led into a
room, and then what happened?

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.749
He fired off a shot
by my head and told me

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.795
to keep my mouth shut
and lay still.

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.838
Or the next one for real.

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.273
And what did you do?

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.599
I lie still.

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:18.474
And were you mistreated
in any way after that?

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:20.509
Mistreated?

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:22.636
Have you ever been
arrested, sir?

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:27.674
Sure.

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.478
Ever spent
a night in jail?

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.709
Yeah.

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:34.256
How many times
have you been arrested?

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.078
I don't know. How many
nights and days have you spent

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.656
in prison for crimes
you've committed...

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.829
I don't know, a few.

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.016
...or alleged
to have committed?

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.314
Criminal acts.

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.078
I don't know. A few.

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.478
Are you certain?

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:52.915
Yeah, you don't forget
a beating like that.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.594
So you're certain
that these three men

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.272
beat you and the others?

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.753
Yes, I'm certain.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:04.037
Up until some army guy
pulled me in a room

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.758
and told me to lie still.

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.816
Then you heard him go out
and tell them I was dead.

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.296
And this is
what's being referred to

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.719
as the "death game"?

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:13.158
What did you see next?

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.875
I didn't see nothin' lying
face down on the floor,

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.757
but I heard Aubrey yell,
"Don't shoot."

02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.637
And he shot. I heard that.

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:27.336
Your witness, council.

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.954
Now we've already
talked to your cohort about,

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:32.235
friend, Lee,
about his criminal past.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.840
Have you ever had trouble
with the law?

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:36.878
I'm not on trial here.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.760
No need to introduce
a new crime, sir.

02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.153
Just the ones already known.

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.037
Or maybe you can start
by telling us,

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.792
how did the night begin?

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.199
Party? A few drinks?

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:49.959
Man, why? Why y'all talking
about me at all?

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.553
Man, y'all see
a black man in court

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.856
and assume
I'm the one on trial.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.155
Man, they killed
my friends, man!

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:56.468
They beat us!

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.835
Lined us up and abused us and
y'all doing the same thing!

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.233
There's no justice here, man.
Go fuck yourself, man.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.536
- Man, no, get off of me!
- Take him out.

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:10.600
This is bullshit!

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.398
What? What you lookin' at?

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:15.439
This is bullshit!

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.152
I think what is clear here,
Your Honor,

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.630
is that these men were under
an intolerable situation.

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:25.439
They were under this duress,
which we say was inherent,

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.351
and for that reason,
had no other choice.

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.509
All right.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.352
All they had to do
was keep quiet.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.476
If they kept quiet,
they wouldn't be here today.

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.193
But they made a statement,

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.840
and that statement
should be admissible.

02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.349
Not if they were
made under duress, Your Honor.

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.880
Not if the taking
of those statements

02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:41.751
violates
constitutional rights.

02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.273
These policemen
were owed an obligation.

02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:50.317
Advising them that they had
a right to remain silent,

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.038
they had a right to counsel,

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:54.350
and that anything they said
could be used against them

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.919
in a court of law.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.879
I don't think
these defendants,

02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.871
because
they're police officers,

02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:02.520
have any right to expect
anything more from us,

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:04.917
but they have a right
under the Constitution

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.434
not to settle
for anything less.

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.116
I therefore rule
the statements inadmissible.

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.437
Wasn't that just
a load of bullshit.

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.748
Whew.

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:17.273
Wow, man.

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.234
That was...

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.197
You know as well I do,

02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.629
those kids shouldn't have been
killed like that.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:26.990
Yeah. It's a shame.

02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.872
Should've complied
with a lawful order

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.632
and relinquish their weapons.

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:37.912
But you're
a solid guy though.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.274
Really.

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:37.555
They know
what they're supposed to do.

02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:50.956
Jury entering. All rise.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.192
All rise.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.117
Has the jury reached
a verdict in this matter,

02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:20.753
with regard
to the charges of murder

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.632
in the first degree
and assault?

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.718
We have, Your Honor.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.078
On the assault,

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:29.074
not guilty.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.108
As to the murder charges,

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.917
not guilty.

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.717
What we have witnessed today is a
disappointment to the justice system,

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:54.915
to the state of Michigan.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.040
Excuse me,
would you like to comment?

02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.395
This wouldn't have happened
if they had found black girls

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:01.118
in a hotel with white men.

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:03.231
No, sir. No way
would they do this

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.639
to white men.
That's the truth!

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:05.976
And I don't care
who knows it!

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.231
Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Pollard, how
do you feel about losing your son?

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:10.594
How do you think he feels?

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:12.591
How would you feel?
How would you feel?

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:14.991
It's a terrible pain.

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:17.456
- A pain that never goes away.
- Come on.

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.595
Thanks, man.

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.136
Listen, sir,
will you conduct yourself

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.388
with a little bit of empathy?

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:22.799
We are here today to witness

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.416
the justice system
at work and we demand

02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:27.716
that police criminality
be treated the exact same way

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:29.432
as any other form
of criminality.

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:30.816
Some people
would say it's wrong

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.296
to judge the police
for doing their jobs.

02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.548
Nice try.

02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:35.256
- You have my statement.
- What a shame.

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.236
Police criminality
needs to be treated

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:40.352
the same as any other
form of criminality.

02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.636
Some people
are made of plastic

02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:07.394
You know some people
are made of wood

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:13.352
Some people
have hearts of stone

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:18.874
Some people are up to
no good Some people

02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.040
But baby

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.233
I'm for real

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.909
I'm as real
as real can get

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:37.715
And if what you're looking
for is real lovin '

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:40.432
Then what you see

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:42.912
Is what you get

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:46.876
We have
a contract, Larry.

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:50.631
We gotta snatch
this, brother.

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.759
Not like this.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.758
Look, Motown
is a black-only company.

02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.637
Oh, but you know what I mean.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.911
Who listens to this music?

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.077
This ain't easy for me, man.

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:16.070
We all a long way from easy.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.158
Well, then you do
what you need.

02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:23.954
I'm gonna lay low.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.839
Come on, man.

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.834
Excuse me, brother.
Yes, son.

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:44.309
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.635
and I never heard
anything back.

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:49.075
Oh, um,
speak to the choirmaster.

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.114
Okay, thank you.

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.353
Excuse me.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:58.536
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.516
and I never heard
anything back.

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.794
Larry Cleveland Reed.

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:03.639
Larry. Uh...

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:05.915
Oh, I remember.
You're with The Dramatics, right?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.149
Yes, sir.

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.719
You're a little bit
overqualified.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.712
We're just
a neighborhood church.

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.400
Well, yeah,
I am overqualified. So?

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:16.596
Why don't you go try some
of those clubs downtown?

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:18.756
I'm sure they'd be happy
to have you.

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:21.115
And I guarantee you,
the pay will be much better.

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:24.510
There's police
at those clubs downtown.

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.512
And it's dangerous.

02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.953
Sir, can you please help me?
I need a job.

02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:37.113
Do you sing
any liturgical music?

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.636
Yeah, I know something.

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.958
Let me see if I...

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.870
Okay.

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.199
Master

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.630
The tempest is raging

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:06.997
Oh the billows

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:13.757
Are tossing high

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:19.998
The sky

02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:26.634
Is overshadowed
with blackness

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:35.198
No shelter or help

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.474
Is nigh

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:48.153
Carest thou not

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.269
That we perish?

02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:02.871
How can thou lie asleep

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.640
When each moment

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.878
So madly is threatening

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.675
Oh a grave
A grave

02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.275
A grave
A grave

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.319
In the angry deep

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.955
Get up, Jesus
Because
