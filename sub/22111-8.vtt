00:02.803 --> 00:04.672
CALLEN: It's your last chance,
Asakeem!

00:04.705 --> 00:06.140
We've been hit! Hang on!

00:06.174 --> 00:07.441
SAM:
She's got no radial pulse.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.209
DOCTOR:
She's still in a coma.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.543
DEEKS:
I hope he was worth it.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.112
I want more time with you

00:11.145 --> 00:12.413
and my children.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.447
SAM:
Aimon Shah.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.415
SAM:
Give me a name!

00:14.448 --> 00:17.051
Hetty's gone.
She has retired, officially.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.752
NELL: Admiral Albert
Jethro Chegwidden.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.088
Close friend of Hetty Lange.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.089
BRIDGES:
Remember how I said

00:21.122 --> 00:22.423
we had to raise
all the money

00:22.456 --> 00:23.324
for our mission
in Southeast Asia?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.793
HETTY:
It wasn't money, it was gold.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.696
You came back for the gold,
but not for me.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.730
How much do you want?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.165
DANG:
For him? Nothing.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.366
You, on the other hand,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.402
gonna fetch
a pretty penny.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.111
*

00:46.280 --> 00:48.682
OFFICER (over speaker):
Customs and Border Patrol.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.718
(sirens wailing)

00:58.859 --> 01:00.628
(engine stops)

01:00.661 --> 01:01.795
Where you headed?

01:01.829 --> 01:02.796
Fresno?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.365
What are you hauling?

01:04.398 --> 01:07.401
Fertilizer.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.802
Can you open the back?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.813
(device beeps, trills)

01:19.847 --> 01:21.349
(grunts)

01:21.382 --> 01:22.716
We got visitors.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.686
Let's get that first row
knocked off, quickly.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.720
I see 'em.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.527
All right, light 'em up.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.828
How many we got?
Six.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.906
(rapid gunfire)

01:45.939 --> 01:48.142
*

02:06.360 --> 02:08.596

02:11.865 --> 02:13.867
(men speaking Vietnamese)

02:18.806 --> 02:21.275
(man grunts)

02:21.309 --> 02:23.311
(shouting in Vietnamese)

02:25.913 --> 02:27.415
(men speaking Vietnamese)

02:37.558 --> 02:40.228
Would you like
some fruit?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.900
I had a big lunch,

02:46.934 --> 02:48.602
about a week ago.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.638
How do you think
this is gonna end?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.475
With a bullet in your head.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.844
(laughs)

02:56.877 --> 02:58.412
I don't think so.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.317
Your future now in the hand
of the highest bidder.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.855
North Korea, China, Russia,

03:07.888 --> 03:10.824
even Iran
made an offer.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.926
So nice to be wanted.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.696
Oh, they want you, but
they want you healthy.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.899
So I'm afraid you're just
going to have to start eating.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.209
I hope you're hungry.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.481
DEEKS:
Oh, this is perfect.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.815
They got
Oreo cookie crusted

03:34.848 --> 03:36.884
French toast with
whipped cream and berries.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.886
Mmm, yeah, if you like diabetes
with your breakfast.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.888
Wonder if those berries
are humanely raised.

03:40.921 --> 03:41.822
(snickers)

03:41.855 --> 03:42.890
Oh, no.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.458
Oh, she brought
the guy.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.459
What guy?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.528
The guy, Guy,
her trainer.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.463
Your mom has a trainer?
That's awesome.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.798
It's not awesome. It's the exact
opposite of awesome.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.799
It's the anti-awesome!

03:51.832 --> 03:53.601
Morning!
Hi!
Oh, my God.

03:53.634 --> 03:57.004
Guy, this is my beautiful
future daughter-in-law Kensi.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.672
Kensi, this is my
fabulous friend Guy.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.673
Nice to meet you.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.442
My pleasure.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.943
And you've met
my gunslinger son, Martin.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.445
How's it going?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.813
Things are spectacular, Guy.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.648
Thank you for asking
about my well-being.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.483
MRS. DEEKS:
Mmm. Okay.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.985
What looks good, kids?
I'm famished.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.054
Guy worked me out
like a dog this morning.

04:14.087 --> 04:14.988
DEEKS:
Oh, my God.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
I'm never gonna
get that out of my brain.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.692
GUY: Bert's been telling me
about your engagement.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.027
Congratulations.
KENSI: Thank you.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.061
Have you set a date?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.396
Eh...

04:22.430 --> 04:23.564
Actually, no.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.032
When are we
getting married, babe?

04:25.065 --> 04:27.067
February 29th.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.769
Huh?
Is this a leap year coming up?

04:28.802 --> 04:29.670
Yeah.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.571
No.
You don't know that.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.972
You don't have a calendar
in front of you.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.073
You don't just know
the dates of things.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.442
It could be a leap year.
Not a leap year.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.643
Got one coming up
pretty quick.
Yeah.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.710
Oh, no. Here we go.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.712
Oh, shoot.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.013
Son of a Pop-Tart.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.615
We got to go, babe.
We got a case.
Aw...

04:41.649 --> 04:43.016
Interesting.
I didn't get anything.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.719
No, it's for my eyes only.
It's an X-K red 20.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.854
Is there something wrong?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.456
No. I told you,
they're secret agents.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.057
They do this stuff all the time.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.692
Kensi almost got herself
killed last year

04:51.725 --> 04:53.561
getting Osama bin Laden.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.995
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, that was...

04:55.028 --> 04:56.029
We did not get
Osama bin Laden.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.665
That was, like,
two thousand and...

04:57.698 --> 04:58.999
Well, it was one of
the bin Ladens.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.501
Yeah, we got
Sheckie bin Laden, Mom.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
That's who we got,
good old Sheckie

05:01.935 --> 05:03.971
when he was ordering a lox plate
at Nate and Al's.

05:04.004 --> 05:04.972
We took him down.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.874
We got to go.
No, Kensi, honey.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.910
You don't have to wait
to get married to have children.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.447
I didn't, and look.
(clicks tongue)

05:13.481 --> 05:14.915
Yeah, look how well
that turned out.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.117
Okay. Don't worry about us.
We'll pick up the tab.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.653
I want to get the tab, 'cause
I don't want you to complain

05:19.687 --> 05:21.021
from now until Thanksgiving.
I'll give you $100.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.990
This way, you can do
some more lunges.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.658
MRS. DEEKS:
Huh. Thank you, sweetheart.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.627
Be careful.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.663
Where's Sam?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.432
He called in sick.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.466
Ooh, that's not good.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.534
Sam doesn't get sick.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.968
What did he say exactly?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.504
He just said
he wasn't feeling well.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.138
To be honest,
he sounded kind of rough.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.006
Ah, damn it.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.041
I totally forgot.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.644
Yesterday was
Sam and Michelle's anniversary.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.012
Oh, God.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.414
We have a case?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.481
Yeah, we do.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.816
Told you.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.983
You got lucky.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.118
Where's Sam?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.153
He called in sick.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.788
What?
That's not good.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.856
Yeah, we've been through that.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.857
I got it covered.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.858
Okay.
Okay.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.126
Then what are
we looking at?

05:59.159 --> 06:01.462
Well, Border Patrol
pulled over a vehicle

06:01.495 --> 06:04.164
in a routine inspection
early this morning,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.899
and it turned into
a bloody massacre.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.935
Three Border Patrol officers
were shot--

06:07.968 --> 06:10.804
two dead on the scene,
one still fighting for his life.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.040
Several illegal immigrants
were also gunned down.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.575
Why is NCIS
involved in this?

06:14.608 --> 06:16.176
Uh, this happened
on Highway 76,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.678
right outside
Fallbrook, California,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
which also happens to be

06:19.146 --> 06:21.782
the avocado capital
of the world.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.617
And right alongside the
east border of Camp Pendleton.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.885
KENSI:
Okay, so we have

06:24.918 --> 06:27.421
a bunch of armed hostiles coming
in through the Mexican border,

06:27.455 --> 06:30.157
attempting to infiltrate
Camp Pendleton?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.058
That sounds like
a suicide mission.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.560
Yeah.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.827
It's probably unrelated
to the Marine base,

06:33.861 --> 06:35.529
but Mosley's secured a chopper
to take you guys

06:35.563 --> 06:36.864
to the crime scene,
just in case.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.065
All right, you two go.
I'm gonna grab Sam.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.066
We'll meet you after.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.100
You got it.
On it.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.108
(sea lion groans)

06:49.543 --> 06:50.444
What's wrong with you?

06:50.478 --> 06:51.612
(groans)

06:51.645 --> 06:53.146
(chuckles)

06:55.649 --> 06:57.050
(knocks)

06:57.084 --> 06:58.952
Permission to come aboard?

06:58.986 --> 06:59.953
Oh.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.122
Looks like it was
quite a party last night.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.624
Did you drink
all this?

07:03.657 --> 07:04.925
Otis had some, too.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.594
You gave whiskey to a sea lion?

07:06.627 --> 07:07.595
Of course not.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.629
He only drinks beer.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.899
Right.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.067
Okay, Jacques Cousteau,
on your feet.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.569
I called in sick.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.837
You're not sick,
you're hungover.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.238
Same thing.
Mm-hmm. Come on.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.172
I'll get you some coffee
on the way.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.475
Let's go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

07:21.509 --> 07:22.810
I need to sleep this off.

07:22.843 --> 07:23.977
No time to sleep.
Here we go.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.879
There we go.
You know what?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.180
Hold this.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.149
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.486
Go ahead.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.787
(vomiting)

07:33.821 --> 07:34.955
Oh, yeah.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.991
There you go. Let it out.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.260
You'll feel better, eventually.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.129
(groans)

07:44.164 --> 07:46.099
(sighs)

07:46.133 --> 07:48.001
CALLEN: You should be
ashamed of yourself, too.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.141
Keep an eye on the boat, Otis.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.543
(burps)

08:03.150 --> 08:04.752
Wow.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.153
This was brutal.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.055
Yeah.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.157
They killed the Border Patrol
officers first,

08:10.190 --> 08:13.093
and then illegals, shooting them
in the back as they ran away.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.828
In the back?
Why would they do that?

08:14.862 --> 08:17.798
Maybe they didn't want them
to talk if they got captured.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.569
They also shot the driver
in the back of the head

08:21.602 --> 08:22.469
while he was
still handcuffed.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.938
I mean, this is
a bloody execution squad.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.574
Large caliber weapons.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.709
These guys meant business.
They also stole

08:28.742 --> 08:30.210
a CBP vehicle and headed north.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.945
Just another Sunday
in paradise.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.981
Lucky us.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.188
Am I supposed to be
following you

08:41.221 --> 08:43.657
or you just
going over there to pee?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.711
Hi.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.793
Can you tell me
your name?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.229
¿Cuál es tu nombre?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.932
Do you have any relatives
in the United States?

09:24.965 --> 09:28.101
¿Tiene parientes en
los Estados Unidos?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.903
DEEKS:
Bueno, bueno, bueno.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.239
No temas,
Tío Marty está aquí...

09:33.841 --> 09:35.976
...con algunas golosinas.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.045
Really?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.814
Couldn't have gotten him a salad

09:40.848 --> 09:42.115
or maybe something
a little healthier?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.817
Well, he's in
America now,

09:43.851 --> 09:46.754
so we got to get his body mass
index up just so he can fit in.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.361
(sighs)

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
I'd kill for
that burger.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.668
Man, when you go down,
you go down hard.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.969
(chuckles)

10:02.002 --> 10:04.672
I miss her, G.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.807
I know you do.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.712
Hurts every day.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.948
And it doesn't get any better.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.184
Ah, it will.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.922
Not today or tomorrow,
but, uh, one day.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.757
Damn.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.162
He still not saying anything?
KENSI: No, not yet.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.198
But I'm guessing he'll
start talking once he's had

10:31.231 --> 10:33.867
something to eat, unless
of course Deeks's hamburger

10:33.901 --> 10:35.435
kills him first.
DEEKS: No, he's a tough kid.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.837
He'll survive.
SAM: You guys find anything

10:36.870 --> 10:37.805
at the crime scene?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.072
Some heavy firepower.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.875
Expended brass and everything
else is being dusted for prints.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.210
And meanwhile,
the Goonies are

10:43.243 --> 10:45.245
searching for that
stolen vehicle.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.114
How's our lone survivor doing?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
Quiet.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.685
DEEKS: We contacted
Health and Human Services.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.054
The Office of Refugee
Resettlement wants to put him

10:54.087 --> 10:56.023
in a shelter until they
figure out deportation.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.691
We got to do better than that.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.426
He's our key witness
and under our protection

10:59.459 --> 11:01.762
until I deem otherwise.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.130
Hopefully he has
some family here.
Well, if he does,

11:03.163 --> 11:04.264
that might be hard to find out.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.699
He's not speaking.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.300
Well, would you after
what he's been through?

11:15.809 --> 11:16.810
Hi.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.949
How's that burger?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.251
Do you like
video games?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.824
Have you ever played this one?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.393
No.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.828
Try it. It's fun.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.864
(laughs) Look at you.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.134
My name is Shay.
What's your name?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.836
Enrique.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.505
Enrique.
That's a beautiful name.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.974
Who knew Mosley was

11:47.007 --> 11:48.809
good with kids?
DEEKS: Yeah, but she's cheating.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.210
She's using video games.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.845
That's like
Chinese brainwashing.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.148
Who brought you here, Enrique?

11:55.182 --> 11:57.785
My mom.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.019
They shot her.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.523
Look, I know you saw

12:03.556 --> 12:05.926
some pretty terrible
things last night.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.229
Do you know the men
who were doing the shooting?

12:09.262 --> 12:11.264
No.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.003
Do you know
where they were going?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.771
No.

12:17.805 --> 12:21.008
Did they say anything
you remember?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.176
They didn't speak Spanish.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.212
They weren't Mexican.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.347
Huh.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.049
What language
were they speaking?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.888
MOSLEY:
I'll be right back.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.790
Well, that's not
encouraging.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.192
We need to get another look
at those body cams.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.961
(sighs):
Okay.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.396
So several... several
heavily armed foreigners

12:43.430 --> 12:44.998
snuck into this country,

12:45.032 --> 12:47.400
tried to pass themselves off
as illegal immigrants.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.403
Camp Pendleton
was never the target.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.872
Alert the other agencies and see

12:51.905 --> 12:52.906
if they have
anything else to share.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.008
We need to know who the hell
we're looking for.

12:55.042 --> 12:55.943
ERIC:
Yo, yo.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.046
FYI, CHP found the CBP SUV.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.915
SCNR--
aka Sorry Could Not Resist.

13:01.949 --> 13:02.916
Where?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.084
Uh, off Topanga.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.053
Tell them not to touch it;
want to protect the prints.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.921
We're on our way.
ERIC: You got it.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.027
I hope we can, too, sir.

13:14.061 --> 13:14.962
Thank you.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.930
Homeland Security
is sending over someone

13:16.964 --> 13:17.998
from their
Field Intelligence Group.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.232
They may have some leads.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.533
Great. Glad someone does.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.070
Uh-huh.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.905
(sighs)

13:24.938 --> 13:27.040
Hey, Nell.
Hi.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.475
Hey, you find anything?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.010
Eh, footage is too dark
for facial rec.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.211
I've blown it up,
brightened it,

13:31.244 --> 13:34.081
slowed it down, run it through
every filter in the book.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.083
Hmm. What about
isolating the audio?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.551
Eh, been there, done that,
didn't even get the T-shirt.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.021
All I can hear is
gunfire and screaming.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.222
I suck.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.556
Come on.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.926
Sounds like someone
needs a Scooby Snack.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.260
(imitates Scooby-Doo):
Well?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.229
Thanks for coming
so quickly.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.064
Your SAC said that
you have some leads.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.333
Yes, we're tracking several high
risk groups south of the border,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.368
and there's a good chance
this is one of them.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.537
Whoa!

13:57.570 --> 14:00.573
Ah! Looks like I found
your secret lair.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.009
Huh. What, uh...

14:02.042 --> 14:04.011
What's she doing...

14:04.044 --> 14:05.578
Uh, what are you doing here?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.014
This is Specialist Jones

14:07.047 --> 14:08.982
from DHS's Field
Intelligence Group.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.984
Oh, I'm aware.
(chuckles)

14:11.018 --> 14:12.185
Sorry, do I know you?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.354
Yes, we met when Penelope
brought you home for Christmas.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.455
Oh, right.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.489
Penelope?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.225
Yeah. This is Sydney.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.592
She's my sister.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.328
Yeah. What's up, Peanut?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.130
Hi.
HIDOKO: This place

14:23.163 --> 14:24.331
never ceases to amaze me.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.443
CALLEN:
Let's go, Sleeping Beauty.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.012
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.148
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.017
You're quoting Baretta?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.019
He was a good cop.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.122
(door slams)

14:49.156 --> 14:50.290
(inhales sharply)

14:50.323 --> 14:52.359
Really?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.193
(sighs)

14:53.226 --> 14:55.028
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

14:55.062 --> 14:56.396
Spotted it about 20 minutes ago.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.165
Anybody of interest
in the vicinity?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.067
No.
(Sam groaning)

15:03.636 --> 15:05.138
(clears throat)

15:05.172 --> 15:07.174
Let's go, slowpoke.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.993
No, G!

15:26.026 --> 15:27.227
(rapid beeping)

15:37.104 --> 15:38.405
(groans):
Oh, man.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.327
How's that hangover?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.495
I saved your life,
didn't I?

16:02.529 --> 16:03.696
Was your turn.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.698
(chuckles)
It's always my turn.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.467
I just saved you from that
guy a couple weeks ago.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.002
What guy?

16:09.036 --> 16:11.438
At the house.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.141
The guy with the wife,
and you were under that table.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.475
You sure that wasn't
some movie you were watching?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.777
Lynn and Keith Stiger's house.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.778
That's the one.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.548
Wow, we can't leave you kids
alone for a second.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.283
You boys okay?
SAM: Great.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.218
Unfortunately, any bit of
evidence that might have been

16:25.252 --> 16:26.519
in that vehicle has
been blown to hell

16:26.553 --> 16:27.687
because of
Mr. Impatient here.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.689
Mm, I seem to remember a time

16:29.722 --> 16:31.691
when you could disarm a bomb
before it exploded.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.293
You were a little younger
back then.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.161
Oh.
(whistles)

16:34.194 --> 16:35.562
You're really pushing
your luck today.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.596
Uh-huh.
So did Pinky and the Brain

16:36.629 --> 16:38.331
find anything else
from that body cam footage?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.367
They're still looking,
but there's nothing here.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.235
Suspects must have gotten a ride
after they dumped the SUV.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.170
DEEKS: I'm guessing
they didn't Uber,

16:43.203 --> 16:46.239
which means they have
help on this side.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.340
Wonderful.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.475
NELL:
Did you know she was coming?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.709
I barely knew who she was.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.344
You told me before
she was a librarian.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.646
She is.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.615
She volunteers.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.584
(scoffs)
Can't believe she's here.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.253
I can't believe you never told
me your real name is Penelope.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.155
(sighs)
What? It's a nice name.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.457
Yeah, maybe if you're from
Victorian England.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.658
(Cockney accent):
She's a dirty puzzle,

17:05.692 --> 17:08.128
that Penelope, she is.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.329
Sydney seems nice.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.132
(sighs) She's not
your older sister, okay?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.401
She's bossed me around
my entire life.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.604
She's always gotten to decide
where we went and what we did

17:17.637 --> 17:19.339
and what we watched

17:19.372 --> 17:20.573
and what I wore.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.276
Maybe that's why you both are
in federal law enforcement.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.113
Yeah, maybe because she always
forced me to play Mystery Team.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.847
Of course she was
always Nancy Drew,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.282
and I had to be freaking Togo.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.284
Whoa, Togo?
Nancy Drew's dog.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
Yeah, I wasn't allowed to
talk. No, I could only

17:33.253 --> 17:35.188
point and sniff out clues.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.223
(snickers)
I mean, come on.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.358
That's kind of hilarious.
Or not. (clears throat)

17:38.391 --> 17:40.827
And now she's here to
take over this case. (growls)

17:40.860 --> 17:42.229
All right, easy, Togo.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.363
Hey, she's in
your house now.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.364
You're the Nellverine.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.232
All right?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.367
Welcome to the jungle, bitch!
Say it.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.335
No, I'm not gonna say it.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.702
Say it. Say it.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.671
Whoa. Are you back on
the Count Chocula?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.206
What are you talking about?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.307
I can smell those marshmallows
from here.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.342
We talked about this.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.544
One box left over
from Halloween, okay?
One?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.412
Smells like you bought out
Pavilions, again.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.880
I need help.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.416
I have a corn syrup
gorilla on my back.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.717
You adorable little
sugar monkey.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.119
All right.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.454
We're gonna get
through this together.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.755
Wonder Twin powers...

18:08.788 --> 18:10.323
Activate.
(imitates explosion)

18:10.357 --> 18:11.358
Form of...

18:11.391 --> 18:13.660
A toothbrush.
Oh, man.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.762
SYDNEY: Several special interest
aliens have tried

18:15.795 --> 18:17.664
crossing our borders recently.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.234
Unfortunately, not all of them
are on the same watch list.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.803
Plus, the lists themselves
are continually being updated.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.139
Well, it doesn't help that
these groups are constantly

18:26.173 --> 18:27.707
changing their names and
forming new alliances.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.908
Exactly.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.643
Texas Rangers
recently stopped someone

18:30.677 --> 18:32.479
with ties to Ansar al-Din.

18:32.512 --> 18:36.549
New Mexican authorities grabbed
a guy linked to Jaysh al-Sunna.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.918
Arizona police,
Liwa al-Haqq.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.189
And this guy was stopped
in San Diego because he had ties

18:42.222 --> 18:44.457
to the Nour al-Din
al-Zenki Movement.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.493
Four different men,
four different states,

18:46.526 --> 18:48.261
all seemingly unrelated,

18:48.295 --> 18:49.862
but in fact all the
groups have merged

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464
into Hay'at
Tahir al-Sham,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.466
or HTS.
SAM: You think the guys

18:53.500 --> 18:54.934
that shot up
the Border Patrol officers

18:54.967 --> 18:56.669
and the immigrants
are part of Tahir al-Sham?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.371
We think it's
a possibility.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.373
So what's their end game?
SYDNEY: Thanks to you,

19:00.407 --> 19:01.708
we have in custody
a high ranking member

19:01.741 --> 19:02.709
of the Al-Nusra Front,

19:02.742 --> 19:04.377
also known as

19:04.411 --> 19:07.714
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham,
which is also part of HTS.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.284
We think they may be here
because of him: Tobias Thoma,

19:11.318 --> 19:13.520
a Syrian national
who joined the Navy

19:13.553 --> 19:14.921
to obtain his
U.S. citizenship.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.856
He was part of
Naval Intelligence

19:16.889 --> 19:19.259
before deserting and
changing his name to...

19:19.292 --> 19:20.427
Ahmed Han Asakeem.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.531
Wait, Asakeem is
here in L.A.?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.533
Yes. He cut a deal
to cooperate.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.403
Excuse me.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.246
Are there any active members
of Tahir al-Sham in the area?

19:39.279 --> 19:42.482
We think so; we just haven't
been able to prove anything.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.551
Well, we need to start.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.787
DEEKS:
Kens.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.422
You okay?

19:49.456 --> 19:52.459
Yeah, just didn't expect
to see him again, that's all.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.961
Well, you went through a lot
because of that guy.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.263
Yeah, we all did.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.599
You good, Kens?
Yeah.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.535
Oh, and we should probably
talk about the Jones sisters.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.904
I mean, is it just me or
do they seem like some sort of

20:04.937 --> 20:06.506
product from a government
cloning experiment?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.407
(laughs)

20:07.440 --> 20:09.476
They're like Minions.
How many are there?

20:09.509 --> 20:10.777
Are there more?
CALLEN: I'll take as many

20:10.810 --> 20:12.445
of them as we can
get right now.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.446
We need to get
out in front of this.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.647
How do you expect
to do that?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.416
We don't know who they are,
where they are,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.750
or why they're even here.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.018
Well, we know they murdered
several innocent people.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.086
And they're probably not done.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.355
But are they here
to launch a terrorist attack?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.523
Are they a hit squad
sent here

20:23.556 --> 20:25.292
to stop Asakeem
from talking?

20:25.325 --> 20:26.793
I mean, hell, they could even
be here to rescue him.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.301
(door buzzes)

20:34.334 --> 20:36.336
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

20:41.508 --> 20:43.510
Okay, let's go.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.746
(tires screech)

20:56.423 --> 20:58.358
Hey, buddy.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.494
Long time no see.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.576
Several members of Tahir al-Sham

21:16.609 --> 21:18.478
have tried crossing
into the U.S. recently.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.348
Conflict in Syria has created
a refugee crisis.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.550
Refugees?

21:23.583 --> 21:24.751
One doesn't have the luxury of

21:24.784 --> 21:26.319
choosing not to fight
in my country.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.087
I thought this was your country.
My birth country.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.023
We were fighting some of
the same people you were:

21:31.057 --> 21:34.661
ISIL, Hezbollah, Assad.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.062
Your people shot us down.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.030
You kidnapped me.
You committed treason.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.969
I saw my people,
my blood relatives, in jeopardy,

21:43.002 --> 21:44.971
and I did all I could
to save them.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.679
Four armed men, possibly
from Tahir al-Sham,

21:52.712 --> 21:55.915
killed two Border Patrol
officers and dozens of civilians

21:55.948 --> 21:58.050
who were trying to sneak in
from Mexico last night.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.652
Are they here
because of you?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.120
I have no idea.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.022
I've been in custody
for over a year.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.557
SAM:
You get visitors.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.359
You talk to the other people
you're being held with.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.360
Why are they here?

22:07.394 --> 22:09.095
I don't know.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.497
I'm sorry.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.739
He's lying.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.940
Does he know
the punishment

22:20.973 --> 22:22.709
for treason is execution?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.411
I'm pretty sure
he's aware of that.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.177
It doesn't seem like
the same guy

22:25.211 --> 22:26.579
we pulled out
of the country.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.647
Yeah, he'll do anything
to avoid Gitmo.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.748
I want to talk to him.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.550
That's probably not
a great idea.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.151
Callen, let me see him,
face-to-face.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.587
You talk. You don't touch.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.555
Of course.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.489
SAM: Kensi.
What?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.457
We're serious.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.725
No contact.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.027
Fine.
All right, let's do this.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.629
No, Deeks,
please just stand down.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.763
I got this.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.899
(door opens, closes)

22:46.933 --> 22:48.435
Remember me?

22:55.642 --> 22:57.544
I'm glad to see you recovered.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.045
We almost died because of you.

23:00.179 --> 23:04.150
I was in a coma and paralyzed
for the better part of a year.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.152
For that I am truly sorry.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.520
You're sorry?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.021
I hope you accept
my deepest apologies,

23:09.055 --> 23:10.089
and I pray for
your forgiveness.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.191
You pray for my forgiveness?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.427
I understand if that's hard
for you to give.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.730
The path to forgiveness
can be long and difficult,

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
but it frees both parties
in the end.

23:19.766 --> 23:23.803
Why don't you save your fortune
cookie crap for the tribunal.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.872
Hey, check this out.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.440
I... Oh.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.208
Where's Nell?
I think she's avoiding me.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.643
That's funny.
Why would she do that?

23:30.677 --> 23:32.645
'Cause she probably
doesn't want me here.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.713
Did you find something?
I did, actually.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.015
But I should probably wait
till Nell and Hidoko...

23:36.048 --> 23:38.050
Ticktock, chicken legs.
What you got?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.186
Okay.
(clears throat)

23:40.219 --> 23:42.589
I estimated the time it
would take to get from

23:42.622 --> 23:43.990
the shooting in Fallbrook
down to where

23:44.023 --> 23:45.458
the SUV was dropped off.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.626
I figured they'd want
to ditch that vehicle

23:46.659 --> 23:47.627
as quickly as possible,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.729
and then get into a new
vehicle that would,

23:49.762 --> 23:52.532
I don't know, seat four adults
plus a driver, right?

23:52.565 --> 23:53.700
So it would be
like a minivan...

23:53.733 --> 23:54.701
Wow, you're a rambler.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.503
Did you find one or not?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.237
Yeah, I-I found two, actually.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.239
Um, they passed by
the nearest traffic camera

24:00.272 --> 24:02.008
shortly after
my time estimate.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.845
Now, traffic in this area is a
little sporadic at this time,

24:05.878 --> 24:08.615
but these two vehicles, they
seem to be traveling together

24:08.648 --> 24:10.650
and with stolen plates.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.919
So we can't trace them?
No, dead end, but I did

24:12.952 --> 24:15.087
get several cell phones
in that area at that time.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.957
I'm hoping one or more of them
belong to one of our shooters

24:17.990 --> 24:20.126
or their
not-so-nice friends.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.494
Now I'm just waiting
on a warrant to run them.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.962
That's why I'm here.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.131
Let's see if any of them
are on our radar.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.132
(tablet clicks)

24:26.165 --> 24:27.734
Okay.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.869
No. No. No.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.171
Ah! Hello.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.206
This number belongs to
a person of interest

24:34.240 --> 24:36.008
we've been tracking
in Los Angeles:

24:36.042 --> 24:37.276
Fazan Kamsour.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.611
All right.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.712
Punch it, blondie.

24:39.746 --> 24:42.048
(both imitate explosion)

24:42.081 --> 24:43.249
(chuckles)

24:43.282 --> 24:45.552
Ah. Where have you been hiding?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.787
Uh, just working.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.822
Well, Sydney and I think
we found a prime suspect.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.958
Oh. Great, yeah. Great.
Mm-hmm.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.225
Great.
Okay.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.563
(sighs) Okay.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.900
So now that you have Asakeem,
what are you gonna do with him?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.301
Uh, we're gonna
sell him.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.271
Great. Now they can add
human trafficking to my charges.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.574
You know, whoever's here,
they're not expecting this.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.609
Hopefully this throws them off
and buys us some time

25:09.642 --> 25:11.043
while they figure out
what's going on.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.812
And what if they find out
this is a hoax?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.881
Well, we're not gonna
give them time for that.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.883
We're gonna get out in front,
we're gonna use Asakeem

25:16.916 --> 25:18.084
to force them into action.
These guys are either

25:18.117 --> 25:20.553
here to kill him or save him;
either way, they want him.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.989
And what if they're here just
to launch a terrorist attack?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.991
We don't think they're gonna
pass up the opportunity

25:25.024 --> 25:26.192
to get Asakeem, but our play

25:26.225 --> 25:28.094
has got to be big
and it's got to be bold.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.862
Bigger and bolder than
what you just did?

25:29.896 --> 25:32.765
Yes. But we need
a few things.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.169
A Rolls-Royce?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.170
Yeah, a white one.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.438
I just gave you
an armored truck

25:39.471 --> 25:43.242
and paid for you to completely
destroy a U.S. Marshals vehicle.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.577
Oh, wait, there's more.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.945
You want
a million dollars.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.346
In cash? Really?

25:47.379 --> 25:48.815
Well, we need money
to make it work.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.117
I should have stayed in D.C.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.318
Go big or go home.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.558
(Arabic pop music playing)

26:01.360 --> 26:03.329
Thanks.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.177
(phone vibrates)

26:30.022 --> 26:31.624
We got a situation.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.192
Got a guy here, Aimon Shah.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.361
Sabatino and I broke up
his place a few months back.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.229
You think he's gonna
recognize you?

26:37.263 --> 26:40.967
(chuckles) I held his face
to a pile of burning embers.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.202
Yeah, people tend to remember
that sort of thing.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.370
He just went inside
with Kamsour.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.337
If he makes me, we're burnt.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.739
I got him.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.910
(Arabic pop music continues)

26:53.079 --> 26:55.147
(gasps, speaks Arabic)
(speaks Arabic)

26:55.181 --> 26:57.049
So sorry.
(shouting in Arabic)

26:57.083 --> 26:59.351
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.153
Here. I-I'll pay
to have it cleaned.
It's fine.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.621
I'm so sorry.
Stop. Just stop.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.702
As-salaam alaikum.

27:15.735 --> 27:16.836
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.043
May I help you?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.978
I need some help making
some travel arrangements.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.980
This is a cafe,
not a travel agency.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.782
How did you
get my number?

27:29.816 --> 27:33.252
Like you, the man in the photo,
he's friends of Tahir al-Sham.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.453
I don't know you.

27:34.486 --> 27:38.357
I don't know your friend,
and I don't know Tahir al-Sham.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.360
SAM: You don't know me because
I prefer not to be known.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.030
I'm only here because
I need a time-sensitive favor,

27:44.063 --> 27:45.732
one which I'm prepared
to pay well for.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.767
(water running)

27:47.800 --> 27:51.237
I'm afraid you've been
misinformed.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.773
Your name is Fazan Kamsour.

27:53.806 --> 27:58.911
You were born
October 5, 1984, in Beirut.

27:58.945 --> 28:03.349
Came to this country
May 6, 2000, with your parents,

28:03.382 --> 28:07.153
Omar and Amila,
your sister, Neela.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.955
(water stops)

28:08.988 --> 28:11.724
Are you kidding me?
I feel really bad.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.392
I'm so sorry.
Please let me pay for it.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.495
You attended USC, dropped out
in your sophomore year

28:16.528 --> 28:18.430
to work here
in your parents' cafe.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.000
Fine. It's $400.
It's designer.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.202
Father died two years ago
of a heart attack.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.438
My condolences.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.174
Your mother lives with
your sister and her husband

28:28.207 --> 28:29.508
in Anaheim.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.477
Uh, can I write you a check?

28:31.510 --> 28:32.378
No.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.512
Information is my business.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.848
Knowledge is
not just power,

28:35.882 --> 28:37.516
it's also currency.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.118
We're fighting
the same struggle.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.486
Hidoko, you need
to keep stalling.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.888
But you can go away.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.762
Back door, Callen.
I need some help.

28:49.796 --> 28:50.797
CALLEN:
Copy.

28:53.199 --> 28:56.035
I saw to it that
our warrior brother was rescued,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.970
but he's not safe here.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.973
I need help getting him
someplace where he will be.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.915
$760,000.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.950
Untraceable bills.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.289
Half when you accept,

29:17.323 --> 29:19.458
the other half
once he's safely back in Syria.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.060
As I said...

29:22.361 --> 29:24.163
...I'm afraid you've been
misinformed.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.837
CALLEN:
You're good, Sam.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.204
Okay.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.843
Here's my number,

29:36.876 --> 29:40.579
in case you know of
someone who can help me.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.414
The offer's only good
for 12 hours, after which

29:42.448 --> 29:45.451
I'll be forced
to find an alternative.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.553
Fi Amanillah.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.902
This is my lawyer. Call him.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.204
The CIA and the NSA
have been using you

30:05.237 --> 30:07.073
to track the criminals
whose money you launder.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.441
Do you really think that this
guy's gonna make a difference

30:09.475 --> 30:10.409
when these organizations
find out

30:10.442 --> 30:12.544
that you're the man
who brought them down?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.446
Huh?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.415
Really doesn't matter
how good he is in court.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.618
It's not gonna stop them
from chopping your head off.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.187
Tell you what.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.955
You recite Surah 9...

30:24.924 --> 30:27.426
...Surah At-Tawba,

30:27.459 --> 30:28.861
you can walk out of here.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.197
Ah, don't feel bad.
I can't say it either.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.933
But then again, I'm not jihadi.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.234
And neither are you.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.969
Although you like
to pretend you are

30:37.003 --> 30:38.237
by helping them
launder their money.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.872
So this is
what's gonna happen.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.074
As of now, you work for us.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.476
And you get to keep doing
what you're doing.

30:44.510 --> 30:48.047
Except that today you are
gonna send Kamsour a message.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.616
You tell him that you had to
go home, you had to change.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.051
Then what?

30:52.084 --> 30:53.485
We'll call you when we need you.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.022
They will kill me
if they know I'm helping you.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.389
That's the
thug life, baby.

30:57.423 --> 31:00.893
You want to be a real gangster,
now's your chance.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.996
Only now you're playing
for the good guys.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.564
Play on, player.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.698
(door opens)

31:06.732 --> 31:09.068
DEEKS: What if Kamsour
doesn't take the bait?

31:09.101 --> 31:10.937
We make another run
using Aimon Shah.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.204
He'll call.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.506
Either for Asakeem or the money,
probably both.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.508
(phone vibrates)
Oh.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.977
Speak of the devil.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.979
(phone vibrates)

31:20.012 --> 31:22.014
Yeah.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.582
Uh, no.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.084
I'm picking the spot.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.218
I have...

31:27.686 --> 31:29.021
Fine.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.090
I'll be there. Don't be late.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.926
They called the location.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.962
And they want me
to come alone with Asakeem.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.063
Mm.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.030
That's never a good sign.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.036
(Arabic pop music playing)

31:52.678 --> 31:54.713
Could be more inside.
Kens, you got anything?

31:54.746 --> 31:55.781
KENSI:
No.

31:55.814 --> 31:58.184
And I can't see through
the tinted windows either.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.052
ERIC: Those are
the two SUVs I saw.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.990
You were told to come alone.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.058
I promised my wife I'd take her
to see Hamilton tonight.

32:06.092 --> 32:06.925
Have you seen it?
No.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.560
It's very good.
You should check it out.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.661
Where's the money?

32:09.695 --> 32:10.729
It's with Asakeem.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.999
How you plan on getting him
out of the country?

32:13.032 --> 32:13.966
It's not your concern.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.435
Osama.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.039
We're gonna be late.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.473
One minute.
I like to know

32:21.507 --> 32:23.075
what I'm getting for my money.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.443
You're getting him to Syria.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.012
How I do it is my business.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.680
You said this was
gonna be quick.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.384
Could you get back
in the car, please?

32:32.418 --> 32:33.452
Darling, who is this?

32:33.485 --> 32:34.953
SAM:
No one.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.057
Asakeem!

32:38.090 --> 32:40.092
*

33:00.046 --> 33:01.413
(Kamsour speaking Arabic)

33:03.815 --> 33:05.451
(gunshot)
KENSI: We got sniper fire!

33:05.484 --> 33:07.053
(gunfire continues)

33:07.086 --> 33:08.087
(engine starts)

33:09.255 --> 33:10.156
Go, go!

33:11.790 --> 33:12.724
Kill them!

33:12.758 --> 33:13.792
They're a hit squad.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.461
They consider Asakeem a traitor.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.495
(tires screech)

33:18.830 --> 33:20.466
Behind!

33:21.767 --> 33:24.070
CALLEN:
Kens, you got the sniper?!

33:24.103 --> 33:25.104
Not yet.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.510
KENSI:
Got you.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.247
Sniper down.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.417
Move! Go, go, go!

33:38.450 --> 33:39.651
We're going!

33:43.155 --> 33:45.023
NELL:
Now!

33:46.125 --> 33:47.493
Federal agents!

33:47.526 --> 33:49.161
Drop your weapons!

33:49.195 --> 33:49.795
Thank you very much!

33:49.828 --> 33:51.697
Did Nell just do that?

33:51.730 --> 33:53.265
Your sister's a badass.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.166
Huh.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.171
(tires screeching)

34:02.541 --> 34:04.076
(horn blaring)

34:04.110 --> 34:05.177
(Callen and Deeks shouting)

34:12.618 --> 34:14.620
(car alarm wailing)

34:17.656 --> 34:20.092
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

34:20.126 --> 34:22.161
I'm telling you
it didn't get hit.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.362
I'm just doing my job.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.365
Where are Nell
and Hidoko?

34:26.398 --> 34:27.699
Uh, headed back.
Oh, great.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.401
So they leave us to
clean up the mess?

34:29.435 --> 34:31.203
It all better be in here,
Detective Deeks.

34:31.237 --> 34:35.073
Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.643
KENSI:
Asakeem.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.111
Kens...

34:39.145 --> 34:40.179
Asakeem, stop.

34:40.212 --> 34:40.846
Whoa, Kensi!

34:40.879 --> 34:43.382
I will shoot you in the ass!

34:43.415 --> 34:45.217
*

35:09.308 --> 35:11.877
Baby, you got
to let it go.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.524
I'm trying.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.874
Nice work.

35:42.908 --> 35:43.875
Yeah, nice work.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.244
Yeah.
Do it again sometime.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.246
Absolutely.
(chuckles)

35:47.279 --> 35:48.647
Ah.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.648
Later.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.550
Yeah, good night.
Bye.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.384
Hi.
Hi.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.353
I watched you
and your team today.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.421
You were impressive.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.788
Thanks.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.657
It's just, you know,
what we do.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.759
Right.
Yeah.

36:00.792 --> 36:01.760
Well, I better
get going.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.694
Yeah.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.263
I have a lot of
debriefing and paperwork.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.364
I can imagine.
(chuckles)

36:05.397 --> 36:06.332
Bye.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.871
You know...

36:12.904 --> 36:14.673
you were really hard
on me as a kid.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.875
I know.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.878
Why?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.848
Because the world isn't safe
for girls. Women.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.852
I wanted you to be tougher
than me, stronger than me.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.989
Maybe I didn't go about it
as well as I should have.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.991
And I'm sorry for that.

36:33.024 --> 36:33.992
Yeah.

36:34.025 --> 36:34.960
But look at you.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.628
You're amazing.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.831
I'm proud of you.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.735
See ya, Togo.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.840
Bye, Syd.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.451
So, uh,

36:59.485 --> 37:01.453
Asakeem is back
in federal custody.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.323
Aimon Shah is back on the
street working for us.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.258
Not bad for
a day's work.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.560
We still don't know why
those militants were here,

37:08.594 --> 37:09.795
but we'll keep digging.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.263
And where's your partner?

37:11.297 --> 37:12.564
He had something to do.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.401
I heard you had
a rough night last night.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.036
Look, if you ever need to take

37:18.069 --> 37:19.305
some time off,
you just let me know.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.639
I'm good.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.376
What's gonna
happen with him?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.811
Well, we found an aunt

37:25.844 --> 37:27.846
who's gonna pick him up,
after I vet her.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.781
That's good.
I hope so.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.617
He's had a rough start.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.619
They're so innocent
at this age, you know?

37:33.652 --> 37:35.821
Still full of hope
and potential.
Yeah.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.323
Do you have kids?

37:39.391 --> 37:40.492
I do.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.860
A son.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.863
His name is Derrick.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.467
He's, uh... he's about his age.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.970
He's with his father.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.405
Back in Washington?

37:53.439 --> 37:55.006
No.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.042
Where does he live?

38:02.581 --> 38:04.583
I don't know, Sam.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.723
Well, good night.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.425
Good night.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.396
(door opens, closes)

38:17.429 --> 38:19.465
(sighs)

38:19.498 --> 38:21.500
*

38:39.818 --> 38:41.587
(sighs)
Looking for something?

38:41.620 --> 38:43.121
What are you doing here?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.155
Same thing as you.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.124
At least I hope we're here
for the same reason.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.125
She's not here.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.428
But you are.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.329
So are you.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.400
Why don't you
make yourself at home.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.734
I am. You want one?

38:55.767 --> 38:58.103
Sure.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.372
I take it you don't know
where she is either.

39:02.408 --> 39:04.142
No.

39:04.175 --> 39:08.146
Did you know that she
officially retired?

39:08.179 --> 39:11.417
Yeah, that's a bad sign.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.084
I thought so, too.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.854
It means she needed to formally
sever ties from NCIS.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.657
Got to protect the agency from
whatever the hell she's doing.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.495
She's selling
all her properties.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.896
This one's still on the market.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.398
Raising capital.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.500
For what?

39:28.534 --> 39:31.403
Damned if I know,
but clearly it's expensive.

39:31.437 --> 39:34.606
Why wouldn't she just use
the gold you have?

39:34.640 --> 39:36.442
She'd have to get our approval,

39:36.475 --> 39:39.411
and obviously she didn't want
to get us involved either.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.414
We found her boat.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.715
Kauai.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.850
What she's doing there?

39:44.883 --> 39:45.917
She's not in Hawaii.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.419
So where is she?

39:47.453 --> 39:51.490
I came here hoping to find
something to tell me.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.124
Maybe you'll have
better luck.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.060
Good to see you again, kid.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.630
Lock the door and reset the
alarm on your way out, would ya?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.739
(grunting)

40:11.209 --> 40:12.578
(door slams)

40:12.611 --> 40:14.613
(keys jangling)

40:14.646 --> 40:16.482
(lock clicks)

40:16.515 --> 40:17.483
(groaning)

40:30.228 --> 40:31.863
I figured they killed you.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.232
(sighs)

40:34.265 --> 40:37.035
I'm not that lucky.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.904
That makes two of us.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.972
(groans) Keane.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.977
I was hoping they'd let you go.

40:46.011 --> 40:49.781
I guess they just
like my company.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.021
You shouldn't have
come back for me.

40:58.056 --> 41:03.995
My life is full of things
I shouldn't have done.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.097
You and me both, sister.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.968
I'm so sorry I left you here.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.169
You didn't know.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.739
I probably would've
done the same.

41:13.772 --> 41:14.740
No.

41:14.773 --> 41:17.876
It was my job to know.

41:17.909 --> 41:22.614
Or to keep looking
until I found the truth.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.851
Well, now you have.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.520
"And the truth
shall set you free."

41:28.554 --> 41:30.221
Right.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.792
(sighs)

41:33.825 --> 41:36.227
Does anyone know
you're here?

41:38.263 --> 41:40.932
No.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.735
But they'll figure it out.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.939
How can you be sure?

41:47.973 --> 41:49.975
I trained them.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.081
And I left them
the tools to do this.

41:57.315 --> 42:00.986
It's only a matter of time.
