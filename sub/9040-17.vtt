00:03.767 --> 00:05.033
- WHERE IS ROBERT?

00:05.033 --> 00:06.733
RAYMOND WILL BE BACK
FROM THE AIRPORT

00:06.733 --> 00:08.800
WITH STEFANIA ANY MINUTE.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.700
AND LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.300
FRANK, ARE YOU HELPING?

00:14.300 --> 00:17.833
- YEAH, I'M BRUSHING UP
ON MY ITALIAN FOR STEFANIA.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.167
[howling]

00:19.167 --> 00:21.133
- OH--
ALL RIGHT.

00:21.133 --> 00:24.133
- I'M STILL NOT SO SURE THIS
IS A GOOD IDEA TO SURPRISE HIM.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.267
DO WE EVEN KNOW IF HE'S
STILL INTERESTED IN HER?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.667
- DEBRA,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:27.667 --> 00:30.433
- UH, JUST WE SHOULDN'T
PUSH HIM INTO ANYTHING.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.533
- WELL, FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO PUSH.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.100
[chuckles]

00:34.100 --> 00:35.867
I JUST HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT MY SON WANTS.

00:35.867 --> 00:38.467
HE WANTS TO FINALLY
HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL.

00:38.467 --> 00:39.967
AND HE WANTS
TO SETTLE DOWN.

00:39.967 --> 00:42.000
AND HE WANTS TO HAVE
GRANDCHILDREN.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.133
- YOU MEAN CHILDREN.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.600
- RIGHT, CHILDREN,
WHATEVER.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.300
- I THINK YOU DID A GOOD THING
BRINGING STEFANIA HERE.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.400
- OH, THANK YOU, FRANK.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.000

A FOREIGN EXCHANGE--

00:57.000 --> 00:59.700
SHE COMES HERE,

01:01.800 --> 01:03.767

01:03.767 --> 01:06.700
- HELLO, SON!

01:10.933 --> 01:12.867

01:12.867 --> 01:14.300

01:14.300 --> 01:17.600
- THE HAPPINESS--
WHAT GIVES?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.733
- WHAT, WE CAN'T BE HAPPY
TO SEE YOU?

01:19.733 --> 01:22.800
- HISTORICALLY, NO.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.933
- YOU FUNNY BUNNY.
[laughs]

01:24.933 --> 01:27.767
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.433
[doorbell rings]

01:40.433 --> 01:42.600

THE DOOR, ROBBIE?

01:49.767 --> 01:52.300

01:52.300 --> 01:54.100
- COME ON, IDIOT.
DO IT.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.633
- WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET IT?

01:55.633 --> 01:56.900
- GET THE DOOR!

01:56.900 --> 01:58.233
[all yelling]

01:58.233 --> 01:59.600
- YOU'RE FORCING ME!

01:59.600 --> 02:01.767
- COME ON. COME ON.

02:01.767 --> 02:05.200
- TRUST ME, ROBERT.
IT'S OKAY.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.867
- COME ON.

02:06.867 --> 02:08.300
YOU KNOW, ROBBIE--

02:08.300 --> 02:10.533
ROBBIE, I KNOW
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LONELY

02:10.533 --> 02:13.133

OF SOME COMPANY,

02:13.133 --> 02:16.300
SO I HAVE A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.500
TA-DA!

I GOT BAGS HERE.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.300
- THIS IS IT?

02:26.300 --> 02:27.667
I DIDN'T LIKE THIS SURPRISE

02:27.667 --> 02:31.000
WHEN YOU GAVE IT TO ME
40 YEARS AGO.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.167
- HEY, HOW ABOUT
"THANK YOU"?

02:35.167 --> 02:36.500

TO CROSS ISLAND--

02:55.933 --> 02:57.400
BUMPER TO BUMPER.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.000
- OH, ROBBIE,
ARE YOU HAPPY?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.633
I ASKED HER TO VISIT

08:49.267 --> 08:53.700
I DID NOT LIKE

10:12.433 --> 10:14.533

10:14.533 --> 10:16.467

10:16.467 --> 10:18.233

IN ITALY,
THE TWO OF YOU COULDN'T

11:03.600 --> 11:05.200
YOU CAN'T KEEP IT
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.833
- NO, TURN IT DOWN.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.800
- WELL, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO ROBERT AND STEFANIA

11:08.800 --> 11:10.367
IF I KEEP IT LIKE THAT?

11:10.367 --> 11:12.133
- THEY'RE GOING TO GET
ALL DRIED OUT AND CRUSTY.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.433
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.500
RIGHT, ROBERT,
YOU WANT IT TO LAST,

11:15.500 --> 11:18.367
YOU GOT TO COOL THINGS DOWN
A LITTLE.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.200
SEE?
LIKE THIS.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.767
- THANK GOD.

11:21.767 --> 11:25.100
- THAT'S HOW IT IS
FOR ME AND DEBRA, RIGHT?

11:27.900 --> 11:29.467
JUST A LITTLE LOW FLAME.

11:29.467 --> 11:32.600
OUR CREAM OF WHEAT CAN JUST
SIT ON THAT FOR YEARS.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.333
- HANDS OFF, GIRLS,
HE'S MINE.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.200
- I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE NOW,

11:46.200 --> 11:49.633
BUT I'LL NEED
THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.400
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

11:57.400 --> 11:59.500
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF YOU'RE HAVING THESE FEELINGS

11:59.500 --> 12:02.467
BECAUSE, DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU STILL CARE FOR AMY.

12:02.467 --> 12:06.267
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT AMY,
AND IT'S NOT CREAM OF WHEAT.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.467
THE--THE TRUTH IS,

12:09.467 --> 12:12.300
STEFANIA'S ANNOYING.
- WHAT?

12:12.300 --> 12:17.467
- IF BY "ANNOYING,"
YOU MEAN HA-CHA-CHA-CHA-CHA,

12:17.467 --> 12:19.633
THEN I'M RIGHT WITH YOU.

12:19.633 --> 12:23.000
- NO, SHE--SHE'S ALWAYS
TOUCHING ME.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.700
- OH, THAT'S GOT
TO BE ROUGH.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.200
- WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU NOT
WANT HER TO TOUCH YOU?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.500
- SHE POKED ME IN THE ASS
WITH A PUTTER!

12:32.500 --> 12:34.600
- SHE COULD HIT ME
IN THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER,

12:34.600 --> 12:36.533
I WOULDN'T CARE.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.267
- IT'S JUST THAT
SHE'S ALWAYS POKING ME,

12:42.267 --> 12:44.067
AND I HATE BEING POKED.

12:44.067 --> 12:48.700
- OH, YEAH.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.333
- HEY, CUT IT OUT, OKAY?

12:51.333 --> 12:52.400
I TOLD HER
I DIDN'T LIKE IT,

12:52.400 --> 12:53.800
BUT SHE WOULDN'T STOP.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.667
- ROBBIE, I THINK
THAT'S LIKE FLIRTING.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.667
- YEAH, REALLY, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE NITPICKING, MAN.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.167
- LOOK, I KNOW STEFANIA
IS BEAUTIFUL, OKAY,

13:01.167 --> 13:03.267
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN OUT
A FEW TIMES NOW,

13:03.267 --> 13:05.200
AND THE MORE TIME
I SPEND WITH HER,

13:05.200 --> 13:09.533
I REALIZE THAT--
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.733
- ROBBIE,

13:16.733 --> 13:19.567
ARE YOU VERY SURE
YOU'RE NOT HOMOSEXUAL?

13:19.567 --> 13:21.500
- MA!

13:31.300 --> 13:33.433
- I-I'M JUST ASKING.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.600
- RAYMOND!

13:41.367 --> 13:44.033
- IT'S STILL FUNNY.
STILL FUNNY.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.800
- YOU--YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.767
IF STEFANIA WAS STAYING
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK,

13:47.767 --> 13:49.300
I COULD PUT UP WITH IT.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.067
BUT NOW THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT STAYING HERE FOR GOOD.

13:51.067 --> 13:53.800
SO, WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED TO
TAKE CARE OF HER FOREVER, HUH?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.600
I GOT TO MARRY HER NOW?

13:55.600 --> 13:58.600
- THERE ARE WORSE THINGS,
DEAR.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.967
- PLUS, I GOT HER FATHER,
SIGNORE "SCARY-OLA,"

14:04.967 --> 14:06.900
WATCHING ME
WITH THOSE EYES.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.833
I MEAN, IT'S TOO MUCH.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.333
- ROBERT, LOOK,
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY UNHAPPY.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.933
YOU GOT TO TALK TO HER.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.200
- AND SAY WHAT?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.567
- I DON'T KNOW;
TELL HER THAT, YOU KNOW,

14:15.567 --> 14:17.167
YOU JUST WANT
TO BE FRIENDS.

14:17.167 --> 14:21.300
- THAT BROAD AIN'T BUILT
FOR FRIENDSHIP.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.567
- LOOK, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE PRESSURED

14:23.567 --> 14:25.467
INTO BEING
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.500
- NO ONE HERE MEANS
TO PRESSURE HIM,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.300
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
ROBBIE?

14:29.300 --> 14:32.767
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.233
AND--AND I READ,
YOU KNOW,

14:34.233 --> 14:37.567
THAT AS MEN GET OLDER,
THEIR SPERM PRODUCTION--

14:37.567 --> 14:38.633
- OKAY!

14:38.633 --> 14:40.667
- MA, MA, MA, MA!

14:40.667 --> 14:42.967
- BACK IT UP.

14:42.967 --> 14:46.433
- PLEASE. IT'S SCIENCE.

14:46.433 --> 14:49.400
- YOU'RE REALLY THINKING
OF BREAKING UP WITH HER?

14:49.400 --> 14:52.233
- THAT IS THE ONLY
DECENT THING TO DO.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.700
THIS IS ABOUT MORALITY.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.567
YOU DON'T
STRING SOMEONE ALONG.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.933
- YEAH, BUT STEFANIA--
SHE'S SO--

14:59.933 --> 15:03.333
- SHE'S SO WHAT, RAY?

15:03.333 --> 15:06.467
- JUST DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.000
- I LIKE YOUR HOUSE.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.433
- IT'S AN APARTMENT,
REALLY.

15:16.433 --> 15:20.133
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.467
- OKAY, UM,

15:22.467 --> 15:25.700
LISTEN, WE NEED
TO TALK, OKAY?

15:25.700 --> 15:27.633
- OKAY.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.700
- [voice cracking]
OKAY.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.433
I, UH, THINK THAT
IT'S VERY EXCITING

15:38.433 --> 15:41.067
THAT YOU AND YOUR DAD
ARE TALKING ABOUT MOVING HERE.

15:41.067 --> 15:43.333
- OH, POLIZIA.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.467
- ATTENTION SPAN OF A MOTH.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.067
UH, LISTEN, LOOK,

15:50.067 --> 15:51.833
I JUST HAD THIS
DRY-CLEANED.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.067
- YOU PUT ON FOR ME, HUH?

15:53.067 --> 15:55.500
- NO, NO,
THIS IS FOR WORK, OKAY?

15:55.500 --> 15:58.333
LET'S PUT THIS BACK.
YOU COME OVER HERE.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.767
- TO THE UGLY SOFA.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.400
- YEAH.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.800
- I'M HUNGRY.
DO YOU HAVE FOOD FOR ME?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.733
- MORE?

16:08.733 --> 16:11.333
JUST A SECOND.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.033
- MAYBE YOU HAVE HOT DOGS?

16:13.033 --> 16:15.333
- ONE SECOND.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.567
IT'S LIKE DROPPING WOOD
INTO A CHIPPER.

16:25.067 --> 16:29.033
HERE, I HAVE CAPTAIN SALTY
PRETZEL NUGGETS.

16:29.033 --> 16:30.667
- I LIKE HOT DOGS.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.600
- PRETZEL NUGGETS!

16:44.367 --> 16:47.733
OH.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.333
- WHAT'S WRONG, 'BERTO?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.933
- NOTHING.
IT'S JUST--

16:51.933 --> 16:53.600
THERE'S YOUR TUMMY.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.367
- WELL, YOU DO NOT
PUT IT ON, SO...

16:56.367 --> 16:58.800
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT IS POLICE PROPERTY.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.100
YOU NEED
TO TAKE THAT OFF.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.267
- OKAY.

17:01.267 --> 17:03.300
- WAIT, WAIT, HALT!
NO, WAIT.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.333
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK.
KEEP IT ON.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.867
HERE.
SIT DOWN HERE.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.800
HAVE SOME PRETZELS, OKAY?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.200
- NO, THANK YOU.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.000
I WASN'T REALLY HUNGRY
FOR PRETZELS.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.033
- NO.

17:26.033 --> 17:31.267
STEFANIA,
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

17:31.267 --> 17:33.767
AND A LOVELY PERSON

17:33.767 --> 17:35.700
AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.300
AND I THINK THAT
IT'S VERY NICE

17:38.300 --> 17:40.933
THAT--THAT YOU WANT
TO MAKE A LIFE FOR YOURSELF

17:40.933 --> 17:42.800
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.067
LET ME FINISH.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.533
O-OKAY,
HERE'S THE THING--

17:46.533 --> 17:49.800
YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT

17:49.800 --> 17:52.400
LOVE IS LIKE
CREAM OF WHEAT.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.467
- UM, MAYBE NO MORE TALKING.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.600
- UH, WHOA, WHOA,
YOU WANT TO--

17:58.600 --> 18:00.133
OH, BOY.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.533
HARD TO ARGUE.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.767
NO, NO.
NO, STEFANIA.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO"?

18:14.067 --> 18:16.233
- NO MEANS NO.
SAME IN ITALIAN--

18:16.233 --> 18:18.167
NO MEANS--
[with accent] NO!

18:18.167 --> 18:21.700
- COME, 'BERTO,
WE HAVE WAITED SO LONG.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.000
IT WILL BE NICE.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.100
- I'M NOT SAYING
IT WOULDN'T BE NICE--AND SOFT.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.433
BUT--BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG.

18:30.433 --> 18:33.467
BECAUSE, STEFANIA,
WE SHOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

18:33.467 --> 18:37.133
- IT'S OKAY.
MY FATHER WILL NOT KNOW.

18:37.133 --> 18:41.133
- [sobbing]

18:41.133 --> 18:42.833
NO, NO, NO.

18:42.833 --> 18:48.233
NO, NO, LOOK,
YOU MISUNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT?

18:48.233 --> 18:49.900
I SHOULDN'T LEAD YOU ON.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.067
IT'S MORALLY WRONG,
I THINK.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:55.067 --> 18:58.733
- WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

18:58.733 --> 19:02.067
YOU, ME, NO MORE.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.300
- OH.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.833
- LISTEN, STEFANIA,

19:06.833 --> 19:09.133
I'LL ALWAYS CHERISH
THE MOMENTS WE HAD TOGETHER,

19:09.133 --> 19:11.133
BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO MOVE HERE

19:11.133 --> 19:14.267
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.467
HEY, COME ON--

19:30.733 --> 19:32.867
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS HER IDEA.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.333
SEE, SHE'S CRAZY.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.967
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO "PINOCCHIO" THIS TIME.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.567
YOU SEE,
SHE WANTED ME TO MARRY YOU,

19:43.567 --> 19:47.033
BUT I SAID I COULDN'T
BECAUSE YOU'RE ANNOYING.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.033
- ANNOYING?

19:52.033 --> 19:55.167
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN--
"ANNOYING"?

20:01.067 --> 20:04.000
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.633
- LIAR! I AM SICK
TO LOOK TO YOU.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.000
- BUT, LISTEN,
WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.367
YOU SEE, IN AMERICA,

20:12.367 --> 20:13.767
YOU DON'T BREAK UP--
YOU STAY FRIENDS.

20:13.767 --> 20:14.933
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

20:14.933 --> 20:18.067
- NOT IN ITALY.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.833
- ANNOYING.

20:26.833 --> 20:30.333
LISTEN, I-I DID
THE RIGHT THING.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.467
MORALLY,
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.333
THERE BETTER BE A HEAVEN.

20:59.533 --> 21:02.667
- HEY, NEMO,
I'LL TAKE A SLICE.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.733
SIGNORE FOGAGNOLO.

21:11.733 --> 21:13.100
HI.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.133
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

21:15.133 --> 21:17.267
- I TOLD YOU,

21:17.267 --> 21:19.400
WE STAY IN AMERICA.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.167
- OH, SO YOU WORK HERE NOW?

21:22.167 --> 21:26.033
- I OWN HERE NOW.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.800
- YOU OWN?

21:27.800 --> 21:31.067
WELL--WHAT HAPPENED TO NEMO?

21:31.067 --> 21:35.500
- HE GO AWAY.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
- WHAT? WHERE?

21:37.500 --> 21:39.433
- AWAY.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.733
- [clears throat]
UH, LISTEN,

21:42.733 --> 21:45.733
UH, SIGNORE FOGAGNOLO,

21:45.733 --> 21:50.767
ABOUT STEFANIA...

21:50.767 --> 21:53.700
I AM A HOMOSEXUAL.
