01:05.618 --> 01:07.423
I was pleased to get your note.

01:08.406 --> 01:10.930
This party looks insufferable.

01:13.318 --> 01:17.802
I would prefer not to spend the little time we have together with idle banter.

01:21.546 --> 01:22.779
Well, then...

01:24.418 --> 01:26.416
what do you suggest?

01:27.025 --> 01:28.352
A dance.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.162
You broke my heart, Irina.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.009
That was another lifetime.

01:59.084 --> 02:00.891
I won't do it again.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.654
Good to know.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.850
This has been lovely, but I should go back.

02:36.940 --> 02:38.170
Tell me, Irina.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.740
How did it feel giving the order?

02:43.313 --> 02:44.977
Was it difficult, or...

02:46.616 --> 02:49.309
were you able to remain cold, indifferent?

02:51.181 --> 02:52.607
Were you amused?

02:53.542 --> 02:56.160
Jack, this is cryptic, even for you.

02:56.253 --> 02:57.773
Then let me be clear.

02:58.802 --> 03:00.513
How did it feel to pay a man

03:02.524 --> 03:04.858
to kill your own daughter?

03:07.667 --> 03:10.047
You weren't supposed to find out.

03:12.293 --> 03:16.108
You didn't feel a thing, did you?

03:18.634 --> 03:20.777
How is that possible?

03:22.697 --> 03:25.698
Were Sydney and I nothing to you, merely strategic alliances

03:26.681 --> 03:31.117
to be disposed of once we'd outlived our usefulness?

03:34.581 --> 03:36.531
After all we've been through, Irina,

03:37.420 --> 03:39.179
I deserve an explanation.

03:41.426 --> 03:42.371
Why?

03:44.336 --> 03:47.291
I need a reason.

03:50.098 --> 03:51.761
Because it had to be done.

03:53.914 --> 03:54.813
Jack.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.739
Damn you.

04:30.043 --> 04:30.895
How's Dixon?

04:30.989 --> 04:32.697
- Stable.
- Has his story changed?

04:32.791 --> 04:34.119
No, he still swears he saw her,

04:34.213 --> 04:36.594
but the amount of blood he lost, he must be delusional.

04:36.737 --> 04:38.876
I would have thought you'd place more trust in your partner.

04:38.969 --> 04:40.727
- It's impossible.
- We've seen impossible before.

04:40.819 --> 04:42.579
- This is a distraction.
- You don't know that.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.239
Dad, you killed her.

04:45.126 --> 04:48.368
I killed a woman I believed to be your mother.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.785
Sound familiar?

04:50.346 --> 04:53.395
You know doubling technology exists. The Helix protocol.

04:53.541 --> 04:54.625
Dad, we're being set up.

04:55.373 --> 04:56.702
Elena and Sloane are gone,

04:56.840 --> 04:59.556
and the only person capable of stopping them is dangled right in front of us.

04:59.648 --> 05:01.365
Doesn't that seem a little convenient?

05:02.062 --> 05:04.299
Think about it. This wouldn't be the first time.

05:04.766 --> 05:07.194
Elena manipulated Vaughn into searching for his father.

05:07.287 --> 05:10.529
Look how that turned out. No, they want us to pursue this.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.840
I understand your skepticism, although

05:12.934 --> 05:16.893
your unwillingness to even entertain the idea suggests fear.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.162
Fear? Of what?

05:20.256 --> 05:22.349
Perhaps a false hope.

05:23.238 --> 05:26.528
Maybe it's easier for you to believe mom's alive

05:27.322 --> 05:29.612
than to live with what you did.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.606
Maybe so.

05:33.074 --> 05:34.593
But the fact remains,

05:34.686 --> 05:38.674
as long as Sloane and Elena are out there, we're pursuing every lead.

05:41.810 --> 05:42.995
We have work to do.

05:54.936 --> 05:56.748
- How's Dixon?
- He's lost a lot of blood...

05:56.789 --> 05:57.976
No, sir, we still don't know what their endgame is.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.013
Vaughn, come here and check this out.

05:59.106 --> 06:00.442
Uh, hold on. We may have just gotten something.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.713
DCI. Tell me you just got something.

06:01.807 --> 06:03.162
Well, you know the tapes from the DSR break-in?

06:03.257 --> 06:06.259
I found some data blocks that are still intact. Is that enough for a positive I.D.?

06:06.353 --> 06:07.347
Yeah, that's enough for an I.D.

06:07.532 --> 06:07.958
Up top.

06:08.049 --> 06:10.144
We're identifying one of Elena Derevko's associates right now.

06:10.190 --> 06:11.042
I'll keep you updated.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.229
I just talked to Langley. They are all over this.

06:13.328 --> 06:14.028
Yeah, you have no idea.

06:20.499 --> 06:23.309
I know we're in crisis mode, but did you ask her?

06:27.165 --> 06:28.401
It's not exactly the right time.

06:28.490 --> 06:29.771
When's the right time? What, the night time?

06:29.864 --> 06:31.001
Eric, come on.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.570
Look, it's not like you have a ring burning a hole in your --

06:33.849 --> 06:35.467
You have the ring on you right now?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.988
We got it. He's former Covenant. Lucien Nisard.

06:48.082 --> 06:49.554
And he didn't just head up the DSR break-in.

06:49.647 --> 06:52.172
Once we had a name, I ran a series of traces on a cell network in Prague.

06:52.264 --> 06:54.790
Turns out Nisard made phone calls from the same location

06:54.882 --> 06:57.119
at the same time Dixon says he saw Irina.

06:57.352 --> 06:59.447
Of course, tracking him, that's gonna take some time.

06:59.493 --> 07:01.922
I need you to log in through Sloane's computer.

07:02.202 --> 07:03.912
Check the Blackwell index.

07:04.052 --> 07:05.362
Wait a minute, the Blackwell index?

07:05.830 --> 07:07.875
Sloane doesn't have that. He gave that over to Langley.

07:09.935 --> 07:10.882
Didn't he?

07:12.012 --> 07:13.285
How are you holding up?

07:13.424 --> 07:14.801
I'm trying to stay focused.

07:17.414 --> 07:20.790
- By reopening the Bishop files?
- He killed my mother supposedly.

07:21.163 --> 07:24.119
If she's alive, then the CIA obviously missed something.

07:26.135 --> 07:29.469
Nadia, researching Martin Bishop, it's --

07:29.750 --> 07:32.225
it's  not the most productive use of your time.

07:32.739 --> 07:33.877
What do you mean?

07:34.998 --> 07:36.853
You should talk to Jack.

07:43.221 --> 07:43.738
Okay.

07:44.488 --> 07:49.068
Um, I hope you don't mind me asking, Mr. Bristow, but

07:50.003 --> 07:51.936
when you helped Sloane steal this thing,

07:52.777 --> 07:54.976
you didn't realize he was going to switch sides, did you?

07:55.107 --> 07:56.292
I mean, you didn't see it coming?

07:56.399 --> 07:57.478
- No.
- Okay.

07:57.803 --> 08:01.093
I was just curious because I didn't think that --

08:02.167 --> 08:02.882
W ow.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.094
Look at the people on this thing.

08:05.515 --> 08:06.651
Lucien Nisard.

08:06.978 --> 08:10.317
I want all aliases, addresses, contacts, vices, weaknesses.

08:10.363 --> 08:12.027
No problem. Just give me a sec.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.824
I need to speak with you.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.731
Give us a minute, would you?

08:16.825 --> 08:18.106
Sure. Hey.

08:22.552 --> 08:23.356
What is it?

08:23.645 --> 08:25.442
My mother's killer -- Martin Bishop --

08:25.816 --> 08:27.193
what is it you haven't told me?

08:28.877 --> 08:30.540
I'm tired of lies, Jack.

08:31.082 --> 08:32.982
After what my father and Elena have done,

08:33.217 --> 08:34.501
I want the truth.

08:35.386 --> 08:38.006
Martin Bishop didn't kill Irina. I did.

08:39.504 --> 08:41.645
I learned Irina had put a contct out on Sydney's life.

08:41.767 --> 08:45.725
I believed she was going to have her killed. I had no other viable option.

08:45.819 --> 08:48.964
I killed Martin Bishop because you told me it was him.

08:49.058 --> 08:49.621
Yes.

08:50.417 --> 08:54.097
I learned later that I had been set up by Elena.

08:54.510 --> 08:59.712
Perhaps I was too quick to assume Irina had betrayed me and Sydney again.

08:59.991 --> 09:01.177
Does Sydney know?

09:01.317 --> 09:04.894
This is not the time for recriminations. Your mother may be alive.

09:04.987 --> 09:08.037
I hope she is. And you should, too.

09:16.932 --> 09:17.926
Syd, something's happened.

09:25.556 --> 09:26.834
What's going on?

09:27.173 --> 09:29.263
There's been some sort of accident.

09:29.418 --> 09:31.642
We don't know the details. Russia isn't saying.

09:31.732 --> 09:33.113
But look at the satellite footage.

09:33.202 --> 09:34.580
The city -- Sevogda --

09:34.672 --> 09:37.014
they're coordinating some sort of military perimeter around it.

09:37.099 --> 09:39.193
- Is it a quarantine?
- No idea.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.680
I just spoke to director Chase.

09:46.764 --> 09:49.045
Intelligence on this incident is nonexistent.

09:49.150 --> 09:52.430
Not even our agents within the Kremlin have any inkling as to what's happening.

09:55.050 --> 09:55.760
What is it?

09:55.850 --> 09:57.800
It's from a hacker friend of mine in Moscow.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.535
It's raw footage. You guys should see this.

10:28.148 --> 10:29.142
It's them.

10:41.785 --> 10:44.369
The russian government's officially claiming an industrial accident.

10:44.451 --> 10:45.637
And they expect that story to last?

10:45.730 --> 10:47.967
Well, conspiracy theories have already been posted on the web.

10:48.060 --> 10:50.010
Terrorist attack, military experiment gone wrong --

10:50.107 --> 10:50.907
Don't forget aliens.

10:51.047 --> 10:54.098
I mean, there's lots and lots of speculation about extraterrestrials.

10:54.192 --> 10:56.536
Given what we know, have you been able to put anything together?

10:56.570 --> 10:58.329
You mean Sloane and Elena's endgame?

10:58.516 --> 10:59.224
It's unclear.

10:59.269 --> 11:03.372
But what is obvious is they've activated some sort of ginormous Mueller device.

11:03.465 --> 11:07.807
From the footage, I'd say it's at least six blocks in diameter.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.329
Now, the russian government, they're keeping a tight lid on

11:10.423 --> 11:12.614
what's actually happened, but from what's leaking out,

11:12.674 --> 11:15.806
I'd say the citizens of Sevogda, they're going postal.

11:15.898 --> 11:19.523
I mean, you know, mass violence, aggression, inability to reason.

11:19.621 --> 11:23.146
They must have infected the water supply with the chemical properties of the orchid,

11:23.238 --> 11:24.757
priming the population of the city,

11:24.803 --> 11:27.233
making them susceptible to the effects of the Mueller device.

11:27.372 --> 11:31.524
So what you're saying is, a large red ball plus contaminated water

11:31.632 --> 11:34.044
equals a city full of homicidal maniacs.

11:34.371 --> 11:35.988
That was a sentence I never thought I'd say.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.125
But what's the point?

11:37.262 --> 11:39.356
I mean, besides the weirdest terrorist attack of all time?

11:39.462 --> 11:40.739
Their purpose remains a mystery.

11:40.822 --> 11:43.635
Perhaps Sevogda serves some strategic importance.

11:43.682 --> 11:46.062
I'd go with world domination, but that's always my go-to.

11:46.202 --> 11:48.296
Why isn't important. Stopping them is.

11:48.437 --> 11:50.109
You've destroyed a Mueller device before?

11:50.145 --> 11:56.448
Guys, sorry to interrupt here, but, you know, this thing is beyond toxic.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.707
I mean, and one this size?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.368
Unless it was shut down properly,

11:59.463 --> 12:02.564
it would be like draining primary coolant from a nuclear plant times 10 million.

12:02.653 --> 12:04.939
I don't know how to disarm the device safely anyway.

12:05.032 --> 12:06.265
I know someone who might.

12:06.363 --> 12:08.883
Based on the eyewitness account from agent Dixon,

12:08.977 --> 12:12.698
Irina Derevko is currently being held prisoner by her sister.

12:14.673 --> 12:16.279
Any ideas on how to find her?

12:16.372 --> 12:21.396
Lucien Nisard -- former Covenant member and a own associate of Elena's.

12:21.757 --> 12:24.342
Flight records indicate he flew to Ibiza this morning.

12:24.704 --> 12:28.282
The sordid details in these files should make it easy to isolate him,

12:28.373 --> 12:29.463
get him to talk.

12:29.978 --> 12:31.356
Do whatever it takes.

12:33.414 --> 12:34.426
Wheels up in two hours.

12:37.499 --> 12:38.188
The usual?

12:38.843 --> 12:40.076
Not with what I'll be wearing.

12:43.774 --> 12:45.154
I had this feeling before.

12:46.792 --> 12:47.565
A sense.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.376
I almost felt like I was going to pass out.

12:51.451 --> 12:55.081
I don't know how to describe it, but it was just like dread,

12:55.635 --> 12:57.156
like something horrible was happening.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.502
We've been tasked to rescue a woman who killed my father --

13:09.702 --> 13:12.163
your  mother, who is supposed to be dead, by the way,

13:12.257 --> 13:14.350
and to disable a giant red ball

13:14.818 --> 13:16.625
floating over a russian city.

13:17.794 --> 13:19.315
Crazier things have happened.

13:19.411 --> 13:20.831
That's kinda my point.

13:21.204 --> 13:22.342
Syd, without you.

13:23.042 --> 13:23.990
I'd be lost.

13:24.502 --> 13:28.001
I mean, this world, this job, everything. It would make me insane.

13:29.387 --> 13:30.285
I know.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.638
We're gonna get through this.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.113
How can you be sure?

13:39.047 --> 13:41.380
How can I not be? We're still here

13:44.189 --> 13:45.040
Syd...

13:47.815 --> 13:48.521
What?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.813
Hey. Sorry to interrupt. You ready to roll?

13:54.461 --> 13:55.348
Yeah.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.252
- All right.
- Thanks.

14:01.493 --> 14:02.651
Vaughn?

14:04.145 --> 14:05.148
We should go.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.150
Nadia.

14:15.899 --> 14:17.753
My dad told me he spoke to you.

14:17.864 --> 14:19.701
I was only trying to protect you.

14:19.794 --> 14:20.547
And him.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.327
Yes, and him.

14:24.288 --> 14:27.147
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

14:27.289 --> 14:31.580
It's not important now. You may not believe our mother's alive, but I do.

14:31.813 --> 14:33.238
Please find her.

15:11.164 --> 15:11.682
Got him.

15:12.569 --> 15:13.756
- Where?
- At the bar.

15:15.863 --> 15:16.685
That's him.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.155
How you want to play this?

15:19.249 --> 15:20.912
You want to be rough, or you want me to be rough?

15:21.005 --> 15:22.639
- You're always rough.
- No, I'm not.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.320
- Yes, you are.
- That's not true.

15:24.403 --> 15:25.165
Yes, it is.

15:25.448 --> 15:27.646
Are you talking about at home or on ops?

15:27.724 --> 15:28.446
Both.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.210
Hey, I'm not complaining.

15:32.236 --> 15:34.283
If I'm rough, it's because you like it when --

15:36.067 --> 15:36.924
Are we on comms?

15:37.097 --> 15:40.218
Yes, you're both on comms right now.

15:42.729 --> 15:43.623
We'll both be rough.

15:47.508 --> 15:48.217
Move it.

15:49.439 --> 15:50.425
Water.

15:55.903 --> 15:56.897
Bite me.

16:25.364 --> 16:27.248
- Want me to bite you again?
- Shut up.

16:39.047 --> 16:39.944
Bonsoir.

16:43.643 --> 16:45.737
You're enjoying yourselves?

16:47.422 --> 16:48.517
He's french.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.576
I like the french. They're tender.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.122
Fine.

16:54.386 --> 16:57.580
Are you just gonna stand there and watch all night, or do you want to get involved?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.859
What exactly did you have in mind?

17:01.872 --> 17:03.009
Check the stalls.

17:04.413 --> 17:07.272
Is he going to join us, or just observe?

17:07.366 --> 17:08.694
I think I'll just watch.

17:10.472 --> 17:12.233
Suit yourself.

17:23.561 --> 17:25.419
All this trouble just to rob me?

17:26.334 --> 17:27.809
I would have paid handsomely.

17:27.900 --> 17:30.568
- Transmitting.
- Okay, receiving transmission.

17:30.706 --> 17:32.528
It's encrypted. Standard. Give me a sec.

17:32.679 --> 17:34.268
What do you know about Irina Derevko?

17:34.475 --> 17:35.163
Who?

17:35.304 --> 17:38.927
You'd be surprised what I know about you besides what turns you on.

17:39.066 --> 17:41.161
I know who you've betrayed.

17:41.674 --> 17:43.718
If you don't tell me what you know --

17:44.056 --> 17:46.046
You haven't been watching the news, have you?

17:46.184 --> 17:47.476
Bad timing, sweetheart.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.080
It's the end of the world. Or haven't you heard?

17:50.594 --> 17:54.984
Blackmail is not as effective as it once was.

17:56.090 --> 18:00.140
Numbers, numbers, numbers. Some past girlfriends. Let's see here.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.001
Wait a minute. No Elena, no Sloane.

18:02.077 --> 18:04.698
Stop there! Sydney, there's a mention of Helix in his files.

18:07.957 --> 18:09.859
Tell me what you know about the Helix protocol.

18:09.973 --> 18:11.472
If you know so much about me,

18:11.728 --> 18:15.999
you know this isn't so much a threat as it is a treat.

18:23.010 --> 18:26.076
It's too late. You can't stop this.

18:35.005 --> 18:37.058
Okay, okay! Please.

18:37.873 --> 18:38.952
The Helix protocol.

18:40.544 --> 18:43.155
Elena -- she found it.

18:43.586 --> 18:45.968
Did she use it? Was Irina doubled?

18:52.248 --> 18:56.859
Okay, okay, Elena wanted people to believe Irina was dead.

18:58.075 --> 18:58.894
A follower --

19:00.799 --> 19:02.412
a follower agreed to do it.

19:03.815 --> 19:06.022
Someone volunteered to be murdered?

19:07.318 --> 19:10.989
You have no idea how willing we are to do what is necessary

19:11.360 --> 19:13.041
for what is about to come.

19:14.149 --> 19:17.198
Is Irina Derevko alive?!

19:18.910 --> 19:20.306
Of course she is.

19:39.409 --> 19:41.647
Sydney and Vaughn learned that Irina was moved yesterday from Prague.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.832
She was taken to a remote location in Guatemala.

19:43.973 --> 19:45.364
- Is she okay?
- We don't know.

19:45.444 --> 19:48.500
While Vaughn secures Lucien Nisard for extradition and transport,

19:48.656 --> 19:50.296
you and I are meeting Sydney in country.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.469
You don't seem relieved.

19:54.813 --> 19:56.285
Transport's waiting.

20:19.283 --> 20:21.570
Here's a satellite layout of the camp where your mother's being held.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.447
The river will take you within 100 yards of the perimeter.

20:24.541 --> 20:25.781
How exactly will we find her?

20:26.011 --> 20:27.869
See these cold spots?

20:27.955 --> 20:29.570
They're  all carrying automatic weapons.

20:29.944 --> 20:31.953
- Except for this one.
- Mom.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.055
It appears she's being held in the north east quadrant of the camp.

20:35.803 --> 20:38.948
Once you retrieve her, I'll be waiting two klicks down river.

20:40.884 --> 20:42.871
It's okay to be nervous.

20:43.646 --> 20:45.447
It's just not about meeting Irina.

20:46.063 --> 20:48.095
It's just this feeling.

20:49.351 --> 20:52.289
- Dread? Darkness?
- Yeah.

20:53.225 --> 20:54.410
How do you know?

20:54.923 --> 20:56.395
I've been feeling it, too.

20:57.073 --> 20:59.670
I never believed in prophecies -- you know, fate --

20:59.764 --> 21:02.202
but... now I'm not so sure.

21:04.787 --> 21:07.168
Nadia, is this your gear pack?

21:07.802 --> 21:10.853
That's some of Irina's clothes from CIA storage.

21:11.287 --> 21:12.792
I thought she might need them.

21:15.414 --> 21:17.968
I want to be the one to tell her who I am.

21:19.087 --> 21:19.959
Of course.

21:26.074 --> 21:27.708
I'll see you both at the exfil point.

21:30.569 --> 21:31.263
Be careful.

22:28.207 --> 22:29.978
This is Phoenix. We've reached the perimeter.

22:30.445 --> 22:31.552
Copy that. Proceed.

22:38.906 --> 22:40.328
Phoenix, incoming guard.

22:47.472 --> 22:48.905
All clear. Proceed.

22:49.050 --> 22:50.270
Copy that. We're moving in.

22:51.066 --> 22:54.403
Up ahead 20 yards there should be a small clearing to your left.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.847
No movement from the guards. You're clear.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.680
She's 15 feet straight in front of you.

23:18.054 --> 23:19.286
Over here. This should be it.

23:28.369 --> 23:29.336
She's not here.

23:30.624 --> 23:32.821
Phoenix, you're standing right next to her.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.569
There's nobody here. This -- this can't be it.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.207
Shh.

23:52.534 --> 23:53.574
Okay...

24:14.844 --> 24:15.688
Mom?

24:27.211 --> 24:28.020
Mom.

24:29.891 --> 24:30.882
Mom, I'm here.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.706
S-- Syd.

24:35.635 --> 24:36.535
You're gonna be okay.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.386
Sydney.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.259
I knew you'd come.

25:12.528 --> 25:13.522
Trip wire!

25:30.725 --> 25:32.231
Give me your knife.

25:32.643 --> 25:34.050
I can't reach it.

25:34.286 --> 25:36.430
Here, take mine. I'll hold them off.

26:37.069 --> 26:38.045
They're right behind us.

27:24.565 --> 27:25.462
Dad.

27:48.863 --> 27:50.017
Irina.

28:07.379 --> 28:09.358
Mom, Elena's already begun.

28:10.593 --> 28:11.921
Sloane is with her.

28:13.371 --> 28:15.322
Sloane. Of course.

28:16.606 --> 28:19.061
The only person as driven as she is.

28:20.792 --> 28:22.743
Though her cruelty runs deeper.

28:23.677 --> 28:26.783
I'm sorry we didn't find you sooner, mom. We didn't know.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.205
What did she do to you?

28:39.898 --> 28:44.204
I found a Rambaldi manuscript -- one I knew Elena was looking for.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.777
It's called "il diluvio."

28:48.052 --> 28:49.055
The flood.

28:49.981 --> 28:52.310
Rambaldi imagined a moment when the world would be cleansed,

28:52.392 --> 28:54.730
when everything would begin anew.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.239
An apocalypse.

28:56.323 --> 28:57.873
When I saw what was in the manuscript,

28:57.934 --> 28:59.045
I had to destroy it.

28:59.127 --> 29:02.183
Of course, which is why Elena needed you.

29:04.283 --> 29:06.121
She kept me in darkness.

29:06.231 --> 29:07.271
I don't know...

29:11.497 --> 29:13.386
where, or how long.

29:14.367 --> 29:16.248
I had barely enough food, water.

29:17.325 --> 29:21.174
There came a time I didn't know whether I was alive or dead.

29:22.732 --> 29:27.008
She'd release me only for questioning.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.047
Elena was always volatile, quick tempered.

29:33.217 --> 29:35.502
I expected her to get angry and kill me.

29:39.479 --> 29:41.692
But she had learned patience.

29:52.155 --> 29:56.815
Eventually I was moved to a medical facility and injected with something.

29:57.727 --> 29:59.291
The pain was excruciating.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.907
I'd go into cardiac arrest.

30:01.039 --> 30:06.127
She'd simply stabilize my heartbeat and allow me to rest so I could endure more.

30:07.220 --> 30:12.261
And she did this dozens and dozens of times.

30:16.491 --> 30:18.469
I couldn't fight it.

30:25.229 --> 30:26.607
I told her everything.

30:28.017 --> 30:30.266
Mom... mom...

30:31.557 --> 30:32.553
Sydney...

30:36.342 --> 30:40.111
I wish I could spare you from what's about to come,

30:40.252 --> 30:42.103
but I need you to come with me.

30:42.758 --> 30:43.756
I'm with you.

30:43.892 --> 30:45.229
We must go to Sevogda.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.886
Irina, they've activated the Mueller device.

30:50.043 --> 30:52.606
The effects are already evident. It's too late for that city.

30:52.757 --> 30:54.972
Elena's already there. So is Sloane.

30:55.445 --> 30:58.615
If we don't stop them now, they'll move on to another city, and another.

30:58.632 --> 30:59.529
We'll send a team.

30:59.622 --> 31:03.055
I helped Elena build the device. I can figure out how to destroy it.

31:05.629 --> 31:07.018
There are no alternatives.

31:13.512 --> 31:16.996
All right. I'll tell the pilot to change course.

31:22.236 --> 31:23.612
Is there anywhere I can clean up?

31:25.951 --> 31:26.688
In the back.

31:35.676 --> 31:38.098
Here. I brought you these.

31:39.555 --> 31:40.195
Thank you.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.037
Just some clothes.

32:07.032 --> 32:11.459
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Mom.

32:27.504 --> 32:28.289
Give me an update.

32:28.492 --> 32:30.637
NRO just sent over the satellite images from Sevogda.

32:30.727 --> 32:32.393
There was heavy cloud cover. They couldn't see much.

32:32.483 --> 32:33.724
Has Langley got anything from inside?

32:33.837 --> 32:35.454
Yeah, DSR has a field team in the city.

32:35.594 --> 32:36.312
What'd they find?

32:36.394 --> 32:38.822
We made contact, but their transmission was interrupted.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.652
Langley's trying to reestablish a connection, but so far they're not responding.

32:41.864 --> 32:44.201
- Let me know if I can help.
- Oh, you can. Where's Jack?

32:44.866 --> 32:45.766
He's not here.

32:46.462 --> 32:48.252
He's acting director on this task force,

32:48.345 --> 32:50.833
and right now we're in the middle of a crisis. Where is he?

32:51.358 --> 32:54.261
He's heading up a tactical rescue mission in Guatemala.

32:54.401 --> 32:57.078
A tactical mission? To rescue whom?

32:57.767 --> 32:58.857
Irina Derevko.

33:06.111 --> 33:08.830
We can expect the military perimeter to be heavily guarded.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.358
Entry to Sevogda will be at best difficult.

33:11.630 --> 33:13.819
Do you have any idea what to expect once we're in there?

33:28.612 --> 33:30.630
Is this where the device has been activated?

33:30.880 --> 33:31.407
Yes.

33:31.874 --> 33:34.255
Elena and Sloane need to hole up somewhere safe,

33:34.535 --> 33:36.605
away from the hazards of the Mueller device.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.164
Bristow.

33:40.340 --> 33:43.965
Perhaps a bunker, a warehouse. Needs to be a fortified location.

33:44.563 --> 33:44.949
Yes.

33:48.225 --> 33:48.820
Dad.

33:50.006 --> 33:52.610
It was our pilot. Our plane is being diverted.

33:53.675 --> 33:55.365
Official orders from Langley.

34:12.949 --> 34:14.902
She's working with us. She's not a threat.

34:14.978 --> 34:16.257
Irina Derevko is a fugitive.

34:16.592 --> 34:18.717
You got a problem, you can take it to Langley.

34:19.866 --> 34:20.687
I'll see you.

34:34.436 --> 34:36.672
Taking my mother into custody was a mistake.

34:36.835 --> 34:38.293
Irina Derevko is an enemy of the state.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.525
My mother helped Elena engineer the device. She can disarm it.

34:40.667 --> 34:44.123
She was convicted of espionage, of murdering CIA operatives. Do I need to go on?

34:44.214 --> 34:45.762
We don't have time to debate her record.

34:45.853 --> 34:48.909
If this were any other situation, I would say fine, interrogate her,

34:48.985 --> 34:52.059
vet her intel. But people are dying, and it's only gonna get worse.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.764
It is under control. The matter is being handled.

34:55.184 --> 34:57.051
Really? How? By whom?

34:57.311 --> 35:00.877
The russians are prepping a tactical air strike of Sevogda.

35:00.969 --> 35:03.003
It will be over in a few hours.

35:04.279 --> 35:08.650
An air strike, director Chase, will release toxins into the atmosphere.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.830
The results would be catastrophic.

35:12.755 --> 35:14.180
This is what Elena wanted.

35:14.593 --> 35:16.565
She anticipated how the government would respond.

35:16.645 --> 35:20.667
We need to stall the russians. Let us go in there and shut down the device.

35:22.431 --> 35:25.733
I will not trust Irina Derevko.

35:27.599 --> 35:29.111
When you brought me into A.P.O.

35:29.204 --> 35:32.438
And placed me under Arvin Sloane's supervision,

35:32.819 --> 35:35.056
you asked me to trust you, and I did.

35:35.198 --> 35:36.798
My mind is made up, agent Bristow.

35:36.877 --> 35:38.190
You put Sloane in charge.

35:38.278 --> 35:41.903
You gave Sloane full access to the resources of the CIA.

35:42.088 --> 35:44.823
And now he is going to do more harm than you can even imagine.

35:45.224 --> 35:47.415
We need to find him and end this,

35:47.695 --> 35:50.331
and the only person who can do that is my mother.

35:51.137 --> 35:52.522
Please, director Chase.

35:55.310 --> 35:56.812
This time you'll have to trust me.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.097
Come with me.

36:40.122 --> 36:42.730
You can accompany us to Sevogda on the condition that if --

36:43.769 --> 36:48.130
when we capture Sloane and Elena and deactivate the Mueller device,

36:48.391 --> 36:52.416
you will be returned to CIA custody to serve out your sentence.

36:53.427 --> 36:54.545
Life in prison.

36:55.687 --> 36:56.441
Yes.

37:07.249 --> 37:09.798
How's your jaw?

37:11.989 --> 37:13.131
I've been through worse.

37:14.735 --> 37:19.608
Jack, I understand why you believed you had to kill me, but the truth is,

37:20.041 --> 37:21.687
if the situation had been reversed...

37:24.603 --> 37:26.604
I would have found another way.

37:28.459 --> 37:30.655
I can't imagine this will give you any comfort,

37:30.904 --> 37:32.612
considering what you've been through, but...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.086
the truth is,

37:37.931 --> 37:42.069
there wasn't a day that went by that I didn't regret what I did.

37:45.754 --> 37:48.540
And about my indiscretion with Sloane --

37:48.650 --> 37:51.031
I can hope you'll accept my apology.

37:52.154 --> 37:56.336
Of all the things you've done, that's what you're going to apologize for?

38:03.421 --> 38:05.496
You're going to enjoy getting to know Nadia.

38:07.088 --> 38:08.123
She's exceptional.

38:11.265 --> 38:13.177
I wonder where she got that from.

38:24.358 --> 38:25.399
Let me help you.

38:28.630 --> 38:31.806
I've seen you all my life in my mind.

38:35.988 --> 38:38.768
When this is over, maybe we could spend some time.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.392
I'd like that.

38:44.382 --> 38:45.271
Yes?

38:45.371 --> 38:47.083
The russians are moving up their timetable.

38:47.176 --> 38:48.977
I've tried every channel, but they're resolved.

38:49.055 --> 38:51.266
- How long do we have?
- Uh, about four hours.

38:51.453 --> 38:54.135
We have four hours before a tactical strike levels the city.

38:55.428 --> 38:56.498
Syd, come here.

39:06.164 --> 39:08.704
- I had it all planned out.
- What?

39:08.800 --> 39:10.732
I was gonna take youto the beach, Santa Barbara.

39:11.475 --> 39:14.012
We'd go out for a walk, maybe when the sun was setting.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.855
But now we're here, and I don't know what we're jumping into.

39:19.967 --> 39:22.556
And I may never get another chance to do this again.

39:26.222 --> 39:29.901
Sometimes I wake up before you do, and I watch you sleep.

39:31.970 --> 39:35.600
And I'm overwhelmed, because...

39:36.643 --> 39:37.812
you're so amazing.

39:40.375 --> 39:43.111
And I don't know why I'm lucky enough to have you in my life,

39:44.779 --> 39:46.059
but you're here with me.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.970
And I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you

39:51.344 --> 39:54.064
trying to make you as happy as you make me.

39:55.556 --> 39:56.942
My god, Vaughn.

40:07.336 --> 40:09.789
Sydney Bristow, will you marry me?

40:23.537 --> 40:25.275
We're gonna make it out of here.

40:26.030 --> 40:27.373
Is that a yes?

40:31.666 --> 40:33.300
Ask me on the beach.

40:38.243 --> 40:39.699
We have 60 seconds.
