00:08.275 --> 00:10.186
What is happen to this city?

00:10.677 --> 00:13.521
Ashes here, smoke there.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.315
Why are you so silent?

00:16.583 --> 00:19.291
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.827
Now it's the limit of endurance.

00:22.222 --> 00:25.499
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.062
Smoking is banned
in all public places.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.471
Violation will lead to penalty.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.408
Don't smoke.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.976
No let anyone do.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.781
Smoking will cost you.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.251
Who doesn't want to be happy?

00:45.846 --> 00:48.258
But at what price?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.920
Smoking will cost you.

00:53.554 --> 00:57.001
Smoking can cost you your health.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.465
And for your dear ones.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.637
Smoking will cost you.

03:27.240 --> 03:35.455
<i>With you, with you</i>

03:35.882 --> 03:39.728
<i>With you, I live</i>

<i>My beloved, the glow of your love</i>

04:30.570 --> 04:37.954
<i>Keeps my heart warm</i>

04:38.545 --> 04:42.425
<i>May this light be never</i>

04:42.482 --> 04:46.487

04:46.586 --> 04:50.466

05:11.178 --> 05:15.820
<i>With you, with you</i>

05:34.434 --> 05:41.784
<i>My beloved, the glow of your love</i>

05:42.409 --> 05:49.349
<i>Keeps my heart warm</i>

05:50.517 --> 05:54.488
<i>May this light be never</i>

05:54.588 --> 05:58.536
Blown <i>out by</i> a <i>storm</i>

05:58.625 --> 06:02.471
<i>Never must this light</i>

06:02.562 --> 06:06.135
G0 out in a storm

06:07.834 --> 06:09.814
The show's at 3pm, right?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.678
One, two...
- Buckle my shoe.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.306
Very good.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.282
Three, four...
- Shut the door.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.047
Five, six...
- Pick up the sticks.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.687
Wow! You've learned it all.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.391
How about seven, eight...

06:20.447 --> 06:21.721
Lay down straight.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.392
Nine, ten...

06:24.451 --> 06:26.692
Daanish, I'm already late.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.560
Don't worry.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.436
Thank you.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.475
I'll take 2 minutes.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.169
Keep the car running.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.609
I'll be there soon.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.616
Hurry please!

06:47.440 --> 06:48.316
<i>OkBY-</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:49.478
Wait till mom's back...

06:49.576 --> 06:51.487
I'll tell her what you're up to.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.306
That's okay. Thanks.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.253
Hi Daanish.
- Sada]...

07:25.312 --> 07:26.723
What's the latest on Rameez?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.590
Farooq Rameez? He's in Pakistan.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.228
No. He's right in front of me.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.525
Connaught Place.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.930
Rameez? In Delhi?

07:36.022 --> 07:39.299
In a black SUV.
Get the license plate.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.269
What block?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.530
Hello, Daanish?
- Hello?

07:44.230 --> 07:45.174
Hello, Sada]?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.322
Sada], can you hear me?

07:59.412 --> 08:02.825
Car entering F block.
- Slow down, Papa...

08:02.882 --> 08:04.759
you'll ruin my game.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.091
Sariaj, hurry UP-

08:07.187 --> 08:08.393
Noorie's with me.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.044
Papa, what's happening?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.515
Get down, Noorie!

08:29.309 --> 08:34.952
Papa, this belt is stuck...
Please open it.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.426
Papa...

08:41.888 --> 08:43.299
Come on, move!

08:51.398 --> 08:52.399
Noorie...

08:59.305 --> 09:00.477
Where's the doctor?

09:01.508 --> 09:02.919
Where's the doctor on duty?

10:29.996 --> 10:36.208
<i>With you, with you</i>

10:38.671 --> 10:45.088
<i>With you, with you</i>

10:48.181 --> 10:58.000
<i>With you, I live</i>

11:01.528 --> 11:07.911
<i>With you, /‘II die too</i>

11:09.536 --> 11:16.317
<i>With you, with you</i>

11:24.317 --> 11:26.729
Ruhana wants to be alone.

11:29.489 --> 11:34.063
Come stay with me for a few days.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.383
Daanish.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.319
Here you go.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.125
Get some rest.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.362
And... here.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.662
These pills...

12:06.192 --> 12:07.569
will help you sleep.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.277
Yeah, SF’

12:16.836 --> 12:19.874
We tracked down Ftameeis
satellite phone.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.548
He's still in Delhi.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.349
Rameeis exact location?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.716
It's some deseried colony

12:25.979 --> 12:28.118
The entire sleeper cell is there.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.417
Take enough ammo.

12:30.516 --> 12:31.859
I'm sending the coordinates.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.295
Got it.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.865
How's Daanish?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.394
Well...

12:36.823 --> 12:38.063
He's asleep.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.802
He's not great, but he'll get there.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.140
Don't tell him about Rameez.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.801
He might do something crazy.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.544
Don't worry.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.136
He's on sleeping pills.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.747
Should be asleep
for at least 12 hours.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.280
We'll see after that.

12:59.646 --> 13:02.217
In a shootout between
terrorists and the police...

13:02.315 --> 13:05.592
Officer DaanisHs 4-year-old
daughter was killed.

13:05.852 --> 13:09.163
The Delhi Police is investigating.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.696
Team B, secure the back gate.

13:11.924 --> 13:12.959
Remember...

13:13.192 --> 13:14.535
We want Rameez alive

13:14.627 --> 13:16.868
I repeat, catch the bastard alive.

13:35.581 --> 13:39.552
Team A, secure the main body.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.797
Block the main gate. Go!

13:42.255 --> 13:43.962
Main body secured.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.161
COPY-

13:46.426 --> 13:47.598
Rooftop secured.

13:47.694 --> 13:48.695
Good to go.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.475
Sir... Daanish!

13:56.135 --> 13:57.113
What's Daanish doing here?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.547
What the hell is
Daanish doing there?

13:58.638 --> 13:59.912
Get him out now.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.081
Stop! Stop!

14:19.325 --> 14:20.736
Move in now!

14:28.401 --> 14:29.539
It's the police!

14:35.441 --> 14:36.545
Come in.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.720
Team B, move in.

14:41.981 --> 14:45.394
Go! Go! Moving in now.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.997
Cover that officer.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.038
Pull out the car. Quick!

15:35.635 --> 15:37.205
Rameez, go.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.362
Move! Move!

15:57.423 --> 15:58.367
Cover Rameez!

15:59.058 --> 16:00.628
Target compromised. Move!

16:00.693 --> 16:03.139
Let's go, quick.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.916
Get the car!

16:13.773 --> 16:15.150
Get in!

16:18.711 --> 16:20.349
Go! Go!

16:49.342 --> 16:50.548
Look up.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.954
Look up!

17:16.402 --> 17:20.009
According to our intel Rameez came
to Delhi to meet some politician.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.348
Now how could we find him?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.416
Sir, it was a shootout.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.079
If someone shoots at us...

17:26.179 --> 17:27.954
we can't just sit back.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.685
We have to retaliate.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.228
That's exactly what my boys did.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.531
Sure, we cou|d've...

17:34.587 --> 17:36.294
handled it better...

17:36.355 --> 17:37.663
Handled it better?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.634
It's a bloody mess.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.599
From what I heard...

17:41.661 --> 17:44.039
It's all DaanisHs fault.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.404
Isn't it true?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.672
Sir, DaanisHs daughter...

17:47.767 --> 17:50.407
Suspend him, send him on
a medical leave, I don't care.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.221
Papa, this belt is stuck...

18:33.179 --> 18:34.852
Papa, please help me!

18:59.505 --> 19:00.677
Hey!

19:02.008 --> 19:03.510
Turn the lights off!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.560
Turn the lights off!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.522
Hurry UP!

20:23.155 --> 20:25.101
Late again. Come on in.

20:25.358 --> 20:29.067
Your Wallet.
- Oh, thank God you found it!

20:29.161 --> 20:30.936
All morning, Panditji kept asking...

20:30.997 --> 20:33.944
if anyone
had returned his Wallet.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.913
Don't just stand there.
Come in.

20:56.188 --> 21:01.228
Oh Lord, he's so strong...
and I'm so weak.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.805
O Lord, show me the way.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.276
How do I slay that evil King?

21:08.067 --> 21:11.742
He's so mighty, and I...

21:11.837 --> 21:14.443
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.781
Mr. Pawn, that's too timid!

21:19.378 --> 21:20.789
"How do I slay the evil king?"

21:20.880 --> 21:24.987
Son, you're seeking revenge,
not buying candy!

21:25.518 --> 21:28.590
"How do I slay the evil king?"

21:28.988 --> 21:31.594
Try it again. With all your head.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.929
How do I slay the evil king?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.231
Like that. Once again.
- Panditji

21:36.429 --> 21:37.339
Yes?

21:37.496 --> 21:39.100
This gentleman found your Wallet.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.075
I've taken money for milk

21:41.167 --> 21:43.704
Glasses lying around again!

21:54.780 --> 21:58.523
Thank you...
You brought my daughter home.

21:59.285 --> 22:02.129
This play is in her memory.

22:04.323 --> 22:10.205
That's her... Nina, my daughter.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.865
Last year,
she fell down a staircase...

22:13.966 --> 22:16.503
and died.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.879
I'm sorry.

22:22.141 --> 22:26.453
Forgive me, your daughter's
news reached me late.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.318
I came there, but...

22:29.615 --> 22:31.891
I didn't want to disturb you...

22:35.588 --> 22:38.194
So, I left without meeting you.

22:40.659 --> 22:43.833
You... knew Noorie?

22:44.129 --> 22:47.235
She came to learn chess,
with her mom.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.376
Ruhana, right?

22:49.702 --> 22:50.703
Yes.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.443
This is where she came?

22:56.775 --> 22:58.516
Just twice.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.154
Two classes later,
she said, "This is easy!"

23:04.517 --> 23:06.224
She'd beat me... always.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.822
Before she left, she said

23:10.623 --> 23:12.398
<i>"|'||</i> send my Papa over."

23:12.758 --> 23:14.396
"Teach him chess."

23:14.860 --> 23:16.464
"Poor guy's really weak."

23:17.696 --> 23:18.800
See you.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.139
Do come again...

23:22.034 --> 23:23.809
To play chess with our kids.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.282
You'll feel you're playing
with your daughter.

23:28.641 --> 23:32.214
Like I... play with my daughter.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.520
Sir...

23:47.993 --> 23:51.372
For you and I,
the biggest enemy is time.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.166
It just doesn't seem to pass.

23:55.134 --> 23:58.581
If we get together over
a game of chess, it might.

24:17.122 --> 24:22.800
I'm but a fraction

24:23.229 --> 24:29.236
<i>You make me whole</i>

24:30.369 --> 24:36.285
<i>I owe my life not to heartbeats</i>

24:36.575 --> 24:42.582
<i>But to you, my soul</i>

24:43.749 --> 24:49.825
<i>Whether you say it or you don't</i>

24:49.888 --> 24:56.362
<i>My heart can hear</i>

24:57.129 --> 25:05.947
<i>You're with me, my dear
You're right here</i>

25:06.238 --> 25:07.308
Checkmate!

25:07.373 --> 25:09.944
Uncle... checkmate!

25:13.379 --> 25:14.949
I'm leaving in three minutes

25:15.648 --> 25:17.321
Want to lose one more time?

25:17.716 --> 25:22.028
You'll beat me in three minutes?
- No. In two.

25:22.321 --> 25:25.894
The third minute is to laugh at you.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.665
Go on... run along now!

25:35.768 --> 25:39.306
This is where everyone
gets it wrong, Mr. Daanish.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.812
Students come to learn how to win.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.049
But first,
they must learn how to learn.

25:46.578 --> 25:47.386
Watch!

25:48.714 --> 25:51.092
Let's take this move back.

25:51.717 --> 25:55.426
That's a wrong move. Take it back.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.601
I can't.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.129
Can't take back the wrong move.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.469
There lies the difference
between life and chess.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.882
There are no second chances in life.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.383
In chess, there are.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.349
Come on.

26:21.447 --> 26:22.687
Your move.

26:44.970 --> 26:45.380
Checkmate

26:45.437 --> 26:48.179
<i>A game is a game is a game</i>

26:48.507 --> 26:54.048
<i>To play to win is</i> a <i>sin
Play to learn and you'll win</i>

26:54.913 --> 26:55.983
Checkmate.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.123
Checkmate.

27:02.387 --> 27:03.627
Checkmate.

27:08.927 --> 27:11.931
You see this rook...
he's a crazy beast.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.000
For now, quiet in his corner.

27:14.099 --> 27:18.172
But if the pawn in
front of him dies...

27:18.403 --> 27:21.577
this rook goes on a rampage.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.379
What's going on?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.886
Lower the window.
- Yes?

27:24.943 --> 27:27.355
What's Wrong?
- His horse died.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.447
Horse died?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.830
<i>Your mind is your only tool</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:41.001
<i>Moves that fool are the rule</i>

27:41.960 --> 27:47.603
<i>A game is a game is a game</i>

27:56.008 --> 27:57.043
Checkmate!

28:02.581 --> 28:04.925
<i>A game is a game is a game</i>

28:05.617 --> 28:11.158
<i>To play to win is</i> a <i>sin
Play to learn and you'll win</i>

28:15.227 --> 28:17.764
How was it?
- What?

28:18.764 --> 28:20.402
How did it feel after killing them?

28:22.167 --> 28:24.807
The people who killed your child.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.175
Musfve felt good.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.016
That's how I'll feel
when I kill that bastard.

28:33.579 --> 28:34.580
Who?

28:35.981 --> 28:37.187
Yazaad Qu resh i.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.095
The Welfare Minister?

28:43.655 --> 28:47.660
The "messenger of peace",
Yazaad Qureshi.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.639
I don't get it.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.909
Nina would go to teach
his daughter chess.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.608
One day, Mr. Qureshi's
secretary called...

29:03.475 --> 29:06.319
"Panditji, your daughter
has been in an accident."

29:12.484 --> 29:17.263
Mr. Qureshi said
Nina lost her balance...

29:17.322 --> 29:19.131
and tripped on the stairs.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.242
Maybe he was telling the truth.

29:31.403 --> 29:36.682
That day, only I...
saw Qureshi's eyes.

29:45.417 --> 29:49.160
It was no accident.
She was murdered...

29:50.756 --> 29:52.497
By Yazaad Qureshi.

29:55.494 --> 30:03.037
Yazaad Qureshi's incredible
journey began 8 years ago.

30:03.568 --> 30:08.517
Terrorists attacked a
village of weavers in Kashmir.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.850
They killed 55 people
of the village.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.821
By the time the army arrived...

30:13.879 --> 30:16.325
they found only Qureshi
and his daughter alive.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.322
The whole country admires him.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.327
The guy lost everything,
yet he said...

30:21.386 --> 30:25.562
Guns won't fix anything. Love will.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.801
First won heads.
And then... elections

30:29.194 --> 30:32.141
Within 8 years,
he became the Welfare Minister.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.808
What do we know about his daughter?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.404
Her name is Ruhi.

30:36.702 --> 30:37.840
Age 13.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.347
Nina Dhar taught
her chess for 2 years.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.715
What else?

30:46.812 --> 30:48.189
There's nothing else!

30:48.880 --> 30:50.325
It's an open and shut case.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.993
Nina slipped.

30:52.050 --> 30:52.994
Fell down the stairs.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.826
Head hit the floor. That's it.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.496
Died on the spot.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.391
There were 4 eyewitnesses.

31:00.659 --> 31:01.831
Qureshi's guys.

31:01.927 --> 31:03.167
Let it go, man!

31:03.495 --> 31:07.204
The old man's messing
with your mind.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.343
Did Ruhi see anything?
- No.

31:12.704 --> 31:16.208
She was in her room.
Packing her chess board.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.858
But she was at home.

31:42.934 --> 31:43.708
Hello.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.513
Did you tell the Minister...

31:48.573 --> 31:50.780
that I'm here
about an investigation?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.150
Please hold.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.883
I told you your message
has been conveyed.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.718
Please wait, you'll be called.

31:58.884 --> 31:59.487
Good morning.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.394
The Minister is waiting for you.
- Sir!

32:03.922 --> 32:05.765
The appointment is at 4

32:07.526 --> 32:08.937
Thank you.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.339
Hello.

32:14.299 --> 32:17.280
Sir. You've been called in.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.480
Come in.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.117
Chief, here's your man.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.954
Daanish Ali.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.922
I was just telling your chief...

32:31.983 --> 32:33.826
to put you back on duty.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.294
The terrorist you killed - Rameez...

32:39.991 --> 32:44.565
He's the guy who had
killed my whole family.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.467
Wiped out my entire village.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.539
Why are you still standing?

32:50.769 --> 32:51.975
Do sit down.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.339
Please sit.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.585
I'm really thankful to you.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.821
How can I help?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.327
What's Wrong?

33:08.286 --> 33:09.856
You had something to ask, right?

33:12.591 --> 33:14.093
Don't hesitate.

33:17.929 --> 33:22.935
I wanted to ask how Nina
Dhar slipped down your stairs.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.920
Officer,
isn't this file getting closed?

33:31.977 --> 33:33.957
Yes, sir. The file is being closed.

33:34.579 --> 33:38.220
Don't worry, sir. I'll take care of it.
- It's okay.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.790
It's alright.

33:41.887 --> 33:42.991
Mr. Ali

33:45.190 --> 33:48.899
Fate has been unfair to Panditji.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.698
First, the fanatics burned
down his house in Kashmir.

33:53.331 --> 33:56.278
Then, in a car accident,
he lost his wife...

33:56.868 --> 33:58.472
and both his legs.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.014
Last year,
his daughter fell down the stairs...

34:02.507 --> 34:05.454
Anyone in his situation
can lose mental balance.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.349
You're his friend, aren't you?

34:10.348 --> 34:11.759
Take care of him.

34:15.654 --> 34:16.688
And yourself too.

34:23.795 --> 34:29.574
And if you need any help,
feel free to come to me.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.340
I'd be happy to help.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.255
You used to weave
Cashmere wool, right?

34:53.658 --> 34:54.966
For decades.

34:57.062 --> 34:59.133
That's delicate work.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.904
Yes.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.582
For a weaver,
your grip is rather strong.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.621
I play tennis.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.125
If you get time off
from Panditji and chess...

35:20.685 --> 35:22.130
do join me.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.497
We'll play-

35:29.961 --> 35:31.497
What do you think of yourself?

35:33.031 --> 35:34.101
Sorry, sir.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.304
You're suspended.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.673
If such antics are repeated...

35:41.206 --> 35:42.480
Arrest him.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.119
Understand?

35:48.079 --> 35:50.616
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.156
Sir.

36:00.158 --> 36:05.938
I'm but a fraction

36:06.331 --> 36:12.304
<i>You make me whole</i>

36:13.438 --> 36:19.354
<i>I owe my life not to heartbeats</i>

36:19.644 --> 36:25.686
<i>But to you, my soul</i>

36:26.818 --> 36:32.894
<i>Whether you say it or you don't</i>

36:32.958 --> 36:39.967
<i>My heart can hear</i>

36:40.265 --> 36:49.379
<i>You're with me, my dear
You're</i> right <i>here</i>

36:51.509 --> 36:53.216
How about a game of chess?

36:58.516 --> 36:59.995
You were asleep.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.123
Sorry, I didn't check the time.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.394
Chess is a game of the clock,
my friend...

37:09.060 --> 37:11.233
but there's no
fixed time to play it.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.903
Rubbish!

37:15.433 --> 37:19.245
Waking an old man at midnight,
do you expect poetry?

37:19.304 --> 37:20.282
Come.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.582
Here you go.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.356
Listen to this song.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.560
This was my wife
Nee|ima's favorite song.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.795
She would play it
at every pariy and say...

37:36.287 --> 37:38.961
"Omkar, sing with me."

37:42.160 --> 37:50.545
<i>Come beloved...
let me take you amidst the stars.</i>

37:51.169 --> 37:54.548
Mr. Daanish... presenting...

37:54.873 --> 37:56.375
The Omkar Nath Special.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.279
These special pieces
are used only at pariies.

38:00.578 --> 38:01.818
So why today?

38:02.814 --> 38:04.487
Because We're pariying today.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.789
Today, you've become my friend.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.423
Ask how?

38:08.653 --> 38:09.723
How?

38:10.488 --> 38:12.126
For the first time today...

38:12.324 --> 38:15.794
You didn't call.
Just rang the doorbell. At midnight!

38:17.896 --> 38:19.671
Novv, the rules of this game.

38:20.332 --> 38:23.506
If your pawn dies,
you take a shot from it!

38:23.701 --> 38:24.907
Pick it up.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.947
Come on!

38:28.540 --> 38:29.814
Let's raise a toast.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.283
To our friendship!

38:41.286 --> 38:46.531
You know, nothing can beat
sitting in a Russian bar...

38:47.992 --> 38:52.202
with a Russian woman
and drinking Russian vodka!

38:53.999 --> 38:55.535
Ever been to Russia?

38:56.167 --> 38:57.077
No.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.336
Me neither.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.056
Make your move, Panditji.
Save your Knight.

39:11.316 --> 39:14.160
This is getting bad.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.624
This reminds me of a poem...

39:17.956 --> 39:20.903
<i>There's</i> no <i>escaping the final sleep</i>

39:20.959 --> 39:23.565
<i>Then why, in worry, stay awake?</i>

39:23.895 --> 39:29.038
<i>So far from myself! stand,
I don't feel my own heartache</i>

39:29.100 --> 39:31.580
Aah! You knew this one!

39:33.338 --> 39:38.981
From Ghalib to Shakespeare, I
memorized everything... for Ruhana.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.824
I'll work some magic...

39:43.515 --> 39:46.325
to vvin back your queen of heads

39:52.423 --> 39:53.697
Checkmate!

39:54.792 --> 39:58.171
You're a quick learner. You vvon.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.943
No. You vvon.

40:01.599 --> 40:04.045
This game was about drinking.

40:05.503 --> 40:08.484
Lose pawns, drink vodka!

40:08.773 --> 40:13.813
I only lost a couple.
But your entire army went down.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.887
Now you know
the Omkar Nath Special.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.994
In this game...

40:24.956 --> 40:26.993
you vvin by losing.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.472
Yes?

40:38.837 --> 40:40.839
Panditji?

40:44.242 --> 40:48.713
We're doing a play
my daughter Nina wrote.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.323
Your daughter,
Noorie, was to play the pawn

40:52.417 --> 40:53.794
I'm sure you remember.

40:54.152 --> 40:57.895
I hear dancing is your passion

40:59.224 --> 41:03.730
If you come and teach
dance to the kids...

41:04.596 --> 41:07.167
it'll make Noorie
and Nina happy.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.670
I'm sorry. I can't.

41:17.041 --> 41:21.353
Ruhana, there's one more
mother here who has lost her child.

41:25.383 --> 41:28.455
Her daughter is alive,
but has stopped living.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.298
What you and I have suffered...

41:31.789 --> 41:35.931
Do not inflict that on your mother.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.343
Don't kill her daughter.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.214
Go, my child.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.654
Hi!

42:02.720 --> 42:04.324
Maybe you can help me.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.903
I'm looking for Nina's friend.

42:09.394 --> 42:14.366
Nina told me to look for
the quietest girl in the school.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.205
She said that's her friend, Ruhi.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.975
Do you know the quietest
girl in this school?

42:30.281 --> 42:32.124
You seem rather quiet yourself.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.389
What's your name?

42:38.523 --> 42:39.831
Ruhi.

42:42.894 --> 42:43.770
Hi, Ruhi.

42:45.530 --> 42:47.942
Nina often spoke of you...

42:48.967 --> 42:51.277
She said you love to draw.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.445
Ever made a drawing of Nina?

42:57.442 --> 42:58.443
May |'_>

43:07.085 --> 43:08.189
WOW!

43:12.657 --> 43:15.763
When Nina fell down the stairs,
where were you?

43:26.070 --> 43:27.981
Ruhi, come with me.

43:29.674 --> 43:30.675
Ruhi!

44:39.677 --> 44:41.088
10-minute break.

44:56.127 --> 45:01.372
You blame Daanish
for Noorie's accident.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.537
He blames himself too.

45:09.474 --> 45:13.684
When I visited your child's grave,
I saw him there.

45:15.880 --> 45:21.694
He was pointing his gun...
at himself.

45:28.793 --> 45:30.272
Like this!

45:38.970 --> 45:45.410
Had he succeeded, whom would
you blame for that accident?

45:50.915 --> 45:53.361
My wife, Neelima.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.459
She, too,
was a victim of an accident.

45:58.689 --> 46:00.726
I was driving on the freeway...

46:01.792 --> 46:05.239
with the world's most
beautiful woman beside me.

46:06.631 --> 46:09.874
I was speeding.
And she was laughing.

46:10.701 --> 46:15.411
60 miles per hour...
70... 80... 90...

46:16.140 --> 46:19.314
100...110...120...

46:31.088 --> 46:34.365
The last sound I heard
was of her laughter.

46:40.197 --> 46:42.473
When Neelima passed away...

46:45.236 --> 46:48.513
...| hugged Nina and cried.

46:51.175 --> 46:53.121
But when Nina died...

46:56.047 --> 46:57.890
I had no one.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.565
When I look at you two...

47:06.624 --> 47:09.298
I feel you are so foriunate.

47:12.363 --> 47:14.309
So foriunate...

47:16.801 --> 47:20.305
that you can at least
hug each other and cry.

48:44.355 --> 48:45.663
Darling...

48:47.692 --> 48:49.399
did this man come to meet you?

48:53.364 --> 48:55.275
Did he ask you anything?

49:01.472 --> 49:03.315
Did you tell him anything?

49:04.709 --> 49:05.915
Sure?

49:10.214 --> 49:12.319
If he ever visits you again...

49:13.351 --> 49:15.558
and you open your mouth...

49:16.187 --> 49:18.326
you know what
dad will do, right?

49:28.532 --> 49:29.840
My sweet child.

50:03.734 --> 50:07.477
Daanish! You better do
something about that old man!

50:08.138 --> 50:13.281
You're busy punching here, while
he's raising hell at the station.

50:13.377 --> 50:16.688
He's very upset.
Nina's file was closed.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.388
Mayl come in, sir?

50:22.486 --> 50:23.863
Here's your friend.

50:24.221 --> 50:27.259
Daanish, they've closed Nina's file.

50:30.328 --> 50:33.468
Daanish, get him to understand
that his daughter Nina...

50:33.531 --> 50:36.410
That his daughter Nina Dhar, age 22...

50:36.500 --> 50:39.538
died due to falling
down the stairs.

50:39.937 --> 50:44.784
There were 19 stairs,
and each stair was 7 inches.

50:45.476 --> 50:49.390
Total height 133 inches.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.084
I know these details by head.

50:53.117 --> 50:56.223
After 13 months,
17 days and 8 hours...

50:56.287 --> 51:03.967
all that's changed in this file is
the investigating officer's signature!

51:06.230 --> 51:08.938
The report states facts alone,
Mr. Dhar.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.339
What's the evidence you have?

51:12.670 --> 51:15.776
The evidence lies
in Qureshi's eyes.

51:16.373 --> 51:21.118
Mr. Omkar Nath Dhar,
this is real life...

51:21.746 --> 51:24.522
not your game of chess.

51:25.015 --> 51:26.722
You're right.

51:27.685 --> 51:29.722
In chess,
rooks and knights walk around...

51:29.787 --> 51:30.925
Not rabid dogs.

51:35.326 --> 51:37.203
Daanish.
- Sir.

51:38.696 --> 51:39.766
Get him out of here...

51:41.432 --> 51:42.877
Or I will arrest him.

51:43.634 --> 51:44.704
Sir.

51:47.638 --> 51:48.639
Let's go, Panditji.

51:55.579 --> 51:56.421
Come.

51:57.148 --> 52:01.824
<i>O Benefactor</i>

52:04.622 --> 52:11.597

52:13.230 --> 52:21.376

53:13.524 --> 53:16.971

53:18.829 --> 53:23.744
<i>With empty palms,

53:23.834 --> 53:28.408
<i>Seeking wisdom

53:28.472 --> 53:34.081
<i>Be my guide</i>

53:35.946 --> 53:40.554
<i>Show me the way</i>

53:40.918 --> 53:46.061
<i>Stay by my side

53:46.791 --> 53:51.763
<i>D0 not torment me with doubt</i>

53:51.862 --> 53:56.174
<i>This answer! can't live without</i>

53:57.635 --> 53:58.579
Papa...

53:58.636 --> 54:00.513
<i>O</i> Lord...

54:00.571 --> 54:05.213
<i>To Your grace,
I appeal, my friend</i>

54:05.543 --> 54:10.492
<i>If You shun me,
it'll mean my end</i>

54:10.547 --> 54:13.824
<i>O</i> Lord...

54:13.884 --> 54:21.166
<i>Be my guide

55:35.866 --> 55:40.713
<i>Show me the way</i>

55:41.872 --> 55:46.617
<i>Show me the way</i>

56:03.160 --> 56:03.729
Hello?

56:03.794 --> 56:05.398
Hello, Mr. Daanish! Mr. Daanish!

56:06.430 --> 56:07.773
Panditji!

56:08.265 --> 56:10.541
Panditji! Panditji!

56:11.635 --> 56:13.171
Hello. Hello?

56:14.371 --> 56:15.145
Sada]!

56:25.883 --> 56:29.023
Panditji!
- Mr. Daanish! Here!

56:29.086 --> 56:31.066
Look what he's done.

56:31.288 --> 56:32.358
He ran out that window.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.401
I'll check.

56:33.457 --> 56:35.061
Look what he's done.

56:35.159 --> 56:37.366
Drink some water.
- What happened?

56:41.131 --> 56:42.405
Wazir.

56:43.634 --> 56:44.669
Wazir.

56:45.069 --> 56:46.104
Wazir.

56:46.303 --> 56:47.680
I was sleeping.

56:48.472 --> 56:52.045
Suddenly... I heard a loud noise.

56:52.576 --> 56:55.614
When I came out... there was fire

56:55.712 --> 56:57.419
My chessboard was burning.

56:58.348 --> 57:00.487
A mere pawn... hurls a shoe?

57:02.085 --> 57:03.689
At the king?

57:05.322 --> 57:06.995
Now play chess with me.

57:07.557 --> 57:09.230
Who are you?

57:10.394 --> 57:11.839
I could be anyone.

57:13.630 --> 57:14.631
Oh yes!

57:17.067 --> 57:18.171
I could be the knight...

57:18.235 --> 57:20.010
Tick tock!

57:21.271 --> 57:23.376
Jumps between light <i>&</i> dark squares!

57:23.707 --> 57:27.348
Or the bishop.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.388
Never walks straight!

57:34.785 --> 57:39.530
But I'm the biggest piece
that all the others fear.

57:40.023 --> 57:44.438
lam...

57:46.496 --> 57:48.533
Wazir! [The Queen piece]

57:52.669 --> 57:56.116
<i>Humpty Dumpty sat</i> on a <i>wall</i>

57:59.042 --> 58:02.717
<i>Humpty Dumpty had</i> a <i>great fall</i>

58:05.616 --> 58:09.189
<i>All the king's horses
and all the king's men</i>

58:09.286 --> 58:12.358
<i>Couldn ‘t put Humpty together...</i>

58:12.423 --> 58:14.369
<i>AGAIN!</i>

58:18.228 --> 58:23.143
This is the hand that
hurled the shoe, right?

58:25.469 --> 58:26.846
Does it huri?

58:39.149 --> 58:44.428
The crippled pawn must remember...

58:44.821 --> 58:48.132
that one challenges only equals.

58:48.191 --> 58:50.501
That's when you call it a game!

58:59.837 --> 59:02.340
If a pawn takes
on the mighty King...

59:03.507 --> 59:05.612
he'll be crushed to death.

59:07.144 --> 59:09.590
If you even look at
Yazaad Qureshi again...

59:10.247 --> 59:11.954
I'll burn you alive!

01:00:54.217 --> 01:01:00.133
A bit darker under the eyes...

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.131
thicker beard.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.168
Take care.

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:14.181
Pammi, please see him out.
- Yes.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.051
Sir?

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.760
Yeah, thank you.

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.324
Thank you.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.664
Wazir.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:44.343
I throw a shoe at Qureshi
and he sends Wazir.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:51.344
To him, I'm a crippled pawn.

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:56.320
He doesn't know that
I too have a weapon.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.156
My friend...

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:07.733
If anything happens to me,
my friend won't spare the king.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.998
No harm will come to you.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.134
I promise!

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.913
Papa, please help me...

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.928
Daanish Ali!
Is my sketch haunting your dreams?

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:42.729
Who's that?
- Don't you recognize me?

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:43.931
I'm Wazir.

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:49.240
I heard your promise,
"No harm will come to you"

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.771
Are you sure?
Open your email.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.845
See? Making a bomb is so easy!

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.749
I'm making one too...
for your buddy.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.254
A bomb - for a shoe!

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:10.322
My men are
watching QureshPs core team.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.224
We must find Wazir.

01:03:12.689 --> 01:03:13.895
Staﬂ tapping their phones.

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.029
Including QureshPs.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.337
Daanish, are you crazy?

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.876
Tap the Welfare Minister's phone?

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.605
I want Wazir, Sada].

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.807
Isn't it amazing!

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.139
It's faster than the previous one!

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:32.118
Hey, Daanish! Daanish!

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.890
Do me a favour?
- Sure.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.989
Please send a ‘Thank-You‘ note.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.159
To whom?

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:43.158
To M r. Wazi r!

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:47.592
There are two sides of every coin.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:54.632
Wazir burned my wheelchair...
but that's how I got this new chair!

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:57.611
You're a strange man.
- I agree.

01:03:58.135 --> 01:03:59.512
He cou|d've done something worse...

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.674
Worst case scenario? I'd be dead.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:04.377
Yeah, Sada].

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.647
Where are you?

01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:07.483
With Panditji, at the hospital.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.148
I've got the file
of Yazaacfs tapped calls.

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:13.524
Can we meet?
- Sure. Where?

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:17.490
Brother, this is the
first and last time...

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.658
that I tap a Minister's calls.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:22.637
If I get suspended too...

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.605
We'll both be on the roads,
selling...

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:27.604
Burgers-on-the-go!

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.438
Mr. Qureshi,
I've received the money.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:34.505
Sir, your tickets
for Kashmir are booked.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.608
Reservations done too.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.310
Qureshi's going to Kashmir tomorrow.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.184
Wazir speaking.

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.584
I'll tell SF’...

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:44.922
Friday, 8pm. Hauz Khas Garden.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.418
Friday? That's today!

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:47.427
Let's go!

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:50.829
Move!

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.355
Stop!

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.301
On your knees!

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.498
Raise your hands!

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:33.807
Look up.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:36.837
What's your name?

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:38.468
Your name!

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.446
Tushar. Tushar.

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:42.915
Full name!

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:44.145
Tushar Sharma.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:49.579
Hello.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:53.526
A little message is
all it took to fool you!

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:58.025
Where's my ‘Thank-You‘ note?

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:01.367
Didn't the old man
ask you to send me one?

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.062
"Hey Daanish! Daanish!"

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.400
"Do me a favour?"

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.065
"Please send a ‘Thank-You‘ note."

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.570
I was right there...

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:12.444
watching you...
but you didn't see me.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:14.481
I'll kill you!

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:18.246
What if I kill your
buddy before that?

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.911
Whafll happen to your promise then?

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:25.092
If you want to save the old fool...

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:29.960
stop tracking me.
And keep an eye on him!

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:34.468
In Chess Land,
there lived a tiny pawn.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.430
All the chess pieces loved him.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:43.375
But the pawn had one
enemy - the evil king...

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:45.970
who made the pawn cry.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.608
Teary-eyed, the pawn went to...

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.809
What's this message?

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:55.321
I'm sorry I failed
to look after our friend.

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.915
Will apologize
personally in Kashmir.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.422
Who is Qureshi talking about?

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.731
Message sent on 24th November.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.725
Who was in Delhi to meet him?

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:09.126
Find out who came to meet Qureshi

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.806
Oh!
- Noorie's favourite!

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:13.931
You made them?

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.475
I'll be right back.

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:22.578
Thanks for the cake!

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:39.197
<i>Storms of disasters
fail to make me cry</i>

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:45.607
<i>But</i> a <i>moment of your
absence will flood my eye</i>

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:46.829
Have one.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:57.147
Panditji says Wherever she is,
it'll make her happy.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:01.745
Go ahead.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:06.226
<i>Whether you say it or you don't</i>

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:12.722

<i>You're with me, my dear
You're right here</i>

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.216
Thank you.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.158
Huh?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:41.828
Thank you.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.893
Thank you? What for?

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:47.926
Ruhana spoke to me today.
- Oh!

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.295
I told you I'll work some magic.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.404
What did you think?

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.770
That Pandit was too drunk
to remember his promise?

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.140
My friend...

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.510
Vodka turns me into an Einstein!

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:07.018
Surely you can afford
an occasional smile.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.685
When the Creator asks me...

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.693
"Omkar Nath Dhar..."

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:16.287
"What did you achieve
in the long life I gave you?"

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.559
At least I can say...

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:22.626
"Sir, I taught a friend to smile."

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:47.319
<i>Come beloved...
let me take you amidst the stars</i>

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.727
The oldie keeps
listening to this oldie.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.298
Let me grant his wish...

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:55.263
and send him to the stars.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.765
Guess how?

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:58.171
Like this.

01:09:58.595 --> 01:09:59.630
One

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:00.769
Two

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.173
Three

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:03.436
BOOM!

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.072
Daanish.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:06.973
Daanish.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.008
Daanish!

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:12.876
Sada], stay with Panditji.
- Yes.

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:27.831
See this ticket.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:31.338
Your pal is going to Kashmir...
chasing the King.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.568
Stop him.
Today, just his pawns blew up...

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:36.104
but the next time...

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:37.707
Get it?

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:47.447
Khurana.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.614
One moment.

01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:53.786
So, packed everything?

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.658
Sweater? Jacket? Took everything?

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.533
It must be freezing there.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.495
Where?

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:10.402
Yes...

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.206
I'm going to Kashmir.

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.181
What for?

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:17.041
To hurl the other shoe?

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.645
No.

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:22.824
This time, it won't be a shoe.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:30.760
This is mybattle, Daanish.
It's for <i>me</i> to fight.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.331
This WAS your battle...

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.835
Now it's OURS!

01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:42.438
Pack your stuff.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.545
Where are you taking me?
- To the safe house.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.213
Where Wazir can't reach you...
nor you Qureshi!

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:55.155
I don't even know who I'm
protecting here.

01:11:56.246 --> 01:11:59.693
Ruhana, I'm dreading
the food at that safe house.

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:03.126
Won't you treat me
to a meal before I go?

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.760
Of cou rse.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.300
It'll be good karma.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:09.628
And yes, I won't come alone.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:12.036
I'll have company.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:22.875
Ruhana, the food
is absolutely delicious!

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.713
You're such a charmer!

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:29.381
It's your effect!

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.357
What say, Daanish?

01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:37.688
You know...

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.329
wheneverl look at you two...

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:46.200
it reminds me
of the olden times.

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.775
Thatwas the era of love.

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:54.347
Today, even the spelling
of Love has changed to LUV.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:13:01.279
In these frugal times,
your love remains so generous.

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:10.895
Don't lose it.

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:15.269
Treasure it, like these pictures

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.803
Whenever dust settles on them...

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:19.029
Make sure to wipe it off

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:29.012
<i>I'm but</i> a <i>fraction,
You make me whole</i>

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:45.389
<i>In the game of love</i>

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:51.231
<i>A lone heart can't win</i>

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:58.769
<i>I too shall meet defeat</i>

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:05.375
<i>My love, if you give in</i>

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:12.049
<i>Whether you say it or you don't</i>

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:18.689
<i>My</i> heart can hear...

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:28.964
<i>You're with me, my dear
You're right here</i>

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:42.347
<i>You're with me, my dear
You're right here</i>

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:57.155
<i>Storms of disasters
fail to make me cry</i>

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:10.501
<i>But</i> a <i>moment of your
absence will flood my eye</i>

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:27.692
Panditji?

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:29.933
Hello.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:33.038
Daanish Ali,
you took your buddy home...

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:36.303
but forgot to cancel his ticket.

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:37.709
What?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.510
The old man has
left for the airport

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:44.381
He'll fly all right,
but not in a plane.

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:47.377
Daanish!

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:58.022
Pick it up!

01:16:01.424 --> 01:16:05.702
Sada], aled all check
posts on the way to the airport

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:06.933
What's the matter?

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.368
Panditji is heading to Kashmir.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:11.935
We must stop him!

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.044
Just do it, Sada]!

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.937
Come ahead.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.687
Blue Winger spotted near India Gate.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:31.015
Daanish.
- Yeah, Sada].

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.253
Car located.
- Where?

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:35.329
Near India Gate.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:41.561
Yeah, Sada].

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.000
Are you okay?

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:46.973
Yeah, Sada].
- Rajpath Road, near India Gate.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.859
Game over, Daanish Ali.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:19.938
Panditji!

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:55.070
This endless cheering
means only one thing...

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:58.135
Yazaad Qureshi is about to speak.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.044
As you can see, this enthusiasm...

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.673
is a proof that...

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.218
it'll be a
record-breaking election.

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.980
For the first time in ages...

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:11.548
the people of Kashmir
are hopeful about elections.

01:19:11.647 --> 01:19:15.026
Experts believe this
will start a healthy debate...

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.893
on many issues
impodant to Kashmir.

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:57.597
When is the next flight to Kashmir?
- 9:30, sir.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:58.967
One way or return?

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.336
One way.

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:13.917
<i>Dear Ruhana, the news
of my death might reach you...</i>

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.887
<i>before this letter.</i>

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:18.220
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.325
<i>I failed</i> to <i>be</i> a good
father and husband...

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:24.828
<i>But! wish to be</i> a <i>worthy friend</i>

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:30.393
<i>I can ‘t spare the
one who killed Panditji.</i>

01:20:31.694 --> 01:20:33.640
<i>lf/ don't return...</i>

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:36.709
<i>then think
that I am with Noorie.</i>

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.740
<i>I failed in this world...</i>

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:41.714
<i>but in the next,
I ‘II take good care of our child.</i>

01:20:42.405 --> 01:20:48.219
<i>Forever yours, Daanish.</i>

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:35.235
Welcome. SF’ is expecting you.

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:41.006
Local police,
army and his personal security.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.308
It's a suicide mission.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.774
If you can't help, just say it.

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:51.408
I didn't say that.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:54.986
I'm just giving you the facts.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:02.756
You saved my life once...

01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:07.598
I owe you.

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:15.702
But why all this?

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:19.273
I want Wazi r.

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:23.909
And only Qureshi knows where he is.

01:22:24.473 --> 01:22:27.886
Yazaad Qureshi is being
honoured with the Peace Award.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:30.947
Qureshi has emerged
as the poster boy for peace

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.925
He has swept the polls in Kashmir.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:38.997
Long live Yazaad Qureshi!

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:54.614
Notl, but...

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:59.348
my daughter
deserves this Peace Award.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:01.483
My daughter Ruhi.

01:23:01.944 --> 01:23:05.756
Pure and innocent...
like our Kashmir.

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:07.684
It's after ages...

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:09.661
Cameras on, Daanish.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.026
Be ready.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:15.967
I want the valleys
of Kashmir to bloom again.

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:20.132
Long live Yazaad Qureshi!

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:23.770
Daanish, are you ready?

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:27.514
And I promise...

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:30.374
"No harm will come to you"

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:33.552
"| promise"

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.620
I'll bring peace back in Kashmir.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.720
Good to go.

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:45.257
On my count.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.356
Three

01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:48.799
Two

01:23:49.992 --> 01:23:50.766
One

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.008
Daanish, move now!

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:03.740
Move!

01:24:20.022 --> 01:24:21.092
Left. Left.

01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:23.399
He's going up from the East Wing.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.862
He's heading to his room.

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.584
The commandos are here.

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.581
I can't hold them up for long.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.749
No more than 4 minutes.

01:24:47.383 --> 01:24:48.589
Hurry up, Daanish.

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:42.771
Call Wazir.

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:44.683
Call him.

01:25:51.847 --> 01:25:53.224
Daanish, you're mistaken.

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:55.228
I don't know any Wazir.

01:25:56.852 --> 01:25:57.887
Wait.

01:25:57.953 --> 01:25:59.057
Let's sit and talk.

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:06.695
Where's Wazir?

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.394
You shouldn't have killed Panditji.

01:26:37.393 --> 01:26:39.373
You have only 30 seconds.

01:26:39.428 --> 01:26:40.532
Let's go.

01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:45.238
Where's Wazir?

01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:00.622
Ruhi, go out.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:05.126
Come darling...

01:27:06.355 --> 01:27:07.925
come to dad.

01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:09.529
Ruhi, go out.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:12.862
Come here. Come to dad.

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:17.570
You're not my dad.

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:24.947
This man killed my dad.

01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:27.887
He killed everyone.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:34.853
Killed whom?

01:27:37.286 --> 01:27:38.128
Everyone.

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:50.977
My morn... dad...
my entire village.

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:53.980
When the army arrived...

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:56.106
he got wounded.

01:27:57.806 --> 01:28:02.880
His friends ran away.

01:28:28.337 --> 01:28:33.184
He said to the army
that he's my father.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:37.483
He could never be my father.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:42.261
My father was a good man.

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.725
I live each day in fear.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:52.099
He threatened... if I told anyone...

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:57.036
he'd push me
down the stairs as well.

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:15.561
Like he pushed Nina?

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:24.368
Nina Ma'am promised me...

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:27.736
that she Wouldn't
reveal his secret.

01:29:28.197 --> 01:29:31.576
And yet he killed her.

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:37.743
I'm very scared of him.

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:43.812
Those terrorists
still come to meet him.

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:46.586
According to our intel...

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:49.184
Rameez came to Delhi
to meet some politician.

01:30:00.796 --> 01:30:02.605
Rameez came to meet you?

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.045
Rameez came to Delhi to meet you!

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.078
"Papa, please help me..."

01:30:37.499 --> 01:30:40.378
Breaking news.
Yazaad Qureshi was attacked.

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.711
The Welfare Minister was shot dead.

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:44.580
The shocking truth is that...

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.246
Yazaad Qureshi was just a persona...

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.414
a mask donned
by a ferocious terrorist.

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:52.550
He Wasn't my father.

01:30:53.382 --> 01:30:57.023
I wanted to tell everyone...

01:30:57.552 --> 01:31:02.934
but I was scared.

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.443
This play is dedicated
to Omkar Nath Dhar.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:15.278
Panditji once said to me...

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:17.580
There's a riddle in this play.

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:21.620
A good chess
player can solve it.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.451
Well, I don't play chess.

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:29.122
If you find the solution,
do tell me.

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:33.188
Presenting "The Pawn and The King"

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:44.172
<i>A game is a game is a game</i>

01:31:47.903 --> 01:31:54.013
<i>To play to win is</i> a <i>sin
Play to learn and you'll win</i>

01:31:56.178 --> 01:32:00.024
<i>Your mind is your only tool</i>

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:03.625
<i>Moves that fool are the rule</i>

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:11.937
<i>A game is a game is a game</i>

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:23.179
Far far <i>away,</i> in Chess Land...

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.777
<i>there lived</i> a <i>tinypawn.</i>

01:32:29.177 --> 01:32:33.284
<i>All the chess pieces loved him.</i>

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.295
<i>But one day,
the evil king made him cry.</i>

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.971
<i>Teary-eyed,
the pawn went to his Creator</i>

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:52.405
O Lord... show me the way.

01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:55.505
How do I slay the evil king?

01:32:56.004 --> 01:33:00.111
The Lord said, "Little pawn,
you're the head of chess."

01:33:00.609 --> 01:33:03.590
Make the right moves,
and you'll become...

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.180
the Wazir.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:12.896
Make the right moves...
and you'll become the Wazir.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:15.701
You'll become the Wazir.

01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:20.165
Mr. Wazir!

01:33:20.228 --> 01:33:21.002
Wazir!

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.040
Wazir!

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:31.647
<i>On Lord's advice, the
pawn befriended an honest</i> rook.

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.413
You brought my daughter home

01:33:33.742 --> 01:33:34.914
You've become a friend.

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:36.789
To our friendship

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:42.117
<i>The rook was</i> a <i>calm fellow...</i>

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:45.926
<i>but if his friend got hurt,
he'd go crazy.</i>

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:49.093
When the pawn
in front of him dies...

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:53.128
this rook goes on a rampage.

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:58.404
<i>To unleash the rook,
the pawn played his last move.</i>

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:03.479
If anything happens to me,
my friend won't spare the King.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.786
<i>The pawn sacrificed himself...</i>

01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:14.987
<i>so that the rook
would checkmate the evil King.</i>

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:23.858
Now you know
the Omkar Nath Special.

01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:30.302
In this game, you vvin by losing.

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:47.554
When Panditji was attacked...

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:49.720
what were you doing there?

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.922
Wait a sec.

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.760
I can't hear a thing.

01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:53.925
Come with me.

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:56.066
Did you see Wazir yourself?

01:34:56.124 --> 01:34:58.161
Yes or no?
- Yes!

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:01.730
He ran out that window.
I saw him myself.

01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:03.003
What was he wearing?

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:05.242
Whatever Panditji said.
- What did you see?

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:09.304
I came home,
Panditji pointed at the Window...

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.113
I saw the window moving, so...

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:15.154
So you saw nothing yourself!

01:35:15.243 --> 01:35:17.951
Panditji said it, so I believed it.

01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:23.755
Mr. Daanish, one moment.

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:26.864
Panditji once said to me...

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:30.365
Someday, Daanish will
come to you looking for Wazir.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.696
Give him this Wazir.

01:35:37.265 --> 01:35:38.539
This Wazir?

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.739
Panditji, you're too much.

01:35:41.803 --> 01:35:44.079
I know this is a pen drive

01:35:44.139 --> 01:35:45.982
My children use it for recording.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:50.750
<i>“In this game, you win by losing. "</i>

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:53.587
<i>“Every pawn can become wazir“</i>

01:35:53.648 --> 01:35:55.753
<i>"The pawn sacrificed himself..."</i>

01:35:55.817 --> 01:36:00.357
<i>so that the rook
would checkmate the evil king."</i>

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:02.664
My friend!

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:08.705
You've learned how to learn.

01:36:10.031 --> 01:36:11.942
And since you're watching this...

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:14.908
You've learned how to win.

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:19.143
You vvon!

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:24.747
No. You vvon!

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:27.385
No legs, no guns, I had nothing“

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.052
what else could I do?

01:36:30.085 --> 01:36:32.224
How would I ever get to Qureshi?

01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:41.032
This weak pawn had
only one option...

01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:48.408
One step at a time,
I reached the last square...

01:36:52.741 --> 01:36:54.550
And you became Wazir.

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.913
"Don't you recognize me?"

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.384
"|'m Wazir."

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:29.416
"The oldie keeps
listening to this oldie"

01:37:29.477 --> 01:37:31.753
"Let me grant his wish..."

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.417
"... and send him to the stars."

01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:35.654
"G uess how? "

01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:37.628
"Like this... Boom!"

01:37:40.488 --> 01:37:42.627
The Omkar Nath Special.

01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:45.131
In this game, you vvin by losing.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.938
Get it?

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.405
My first move.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.581
My first move brought
you to my house.

01:37:57.639 --> 01:38:00.017
This gentleman found your wallet

01:38:02.677 --> 01:38:04.520
And my last move...

01:38:05.313 --> 01:38:07.816
My last move took you to Qureshi.

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.497
Checkmate. Game over, Daanish Ali.

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.570
What moves!

01:38:27.035 --> 01:38:28.514
What an end game!

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:33.008
This is not the end.
My real game has just staried.

01:38:34.876 --> 01:38:36.617
When you watch this tape...

01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:40.818
I'll be up there listening
to Neelima's favorite song!

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:46.794
Nina will be with me,
and your Noorie too.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:49.929
I'll play chess with
your daughter there...

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:54.070
while you play here with Ruhana.

01:38:54.963 --> 01:38:57.967
Play your best game... Live it up!

01:38:58.566 --> 01:39:00.307
And remember to smile.

01:39:01.436 --> 01:39:03.541
When the Creator asks me...

01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:07.518
"Omkar Nath Dhar,
what did you achieve..."

01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:09.384
"... in the long life I gave you?"

01:39:11.079 --> 01:39:13.355
I'll tell Him...

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:18.053
I taught a friend to smile.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.033
Time to go, Daanish.

01:39:32.033 --> 01:39:33.569
Time to go.

01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:41.915
So...

01:39:45.947 --> 01:39:47.119
mm
ayI?
