WEBVTT

00:04.829 --> 00:09.065
D Flawless, ten
carats, brilliant cut.

00:09.101 --> 00:11.566
Conflict-free
from Botswana.

00:11.602 --> 00:14.537
Such natural
perfection is rare.

00:14.573 --> 00:16.174
It's stunning.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.208
I'll take them all.

00:19.244 --> 00:22.110
Since we first spoke, there
was a spike in the market.

00:22.146 --> 00:23.813
It seems someone's been buying

00:23.849 --> 00:25.647
these high-quality
stones in bulk.

00:25.683 --> 00:28.684
Well, lucky we got
to them first.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.318
Hmm...

00:30.354 --> 00:31.754
It took quite an effort.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.354
I had to reach
out to my contacts

00:33.390 --> 00:36.224
all over Asia,
Amsterdam, New York.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.559
There were even
some bidding wars.

00:37.595 --> 00:42.330
Well... the price was set.
30 million.

00:42.366 --> 00:44.867
The market is out
of my control.

00:44.903 --> 00:48.637
Six million will cover
my unexpected costs.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.739
I would urge you

00:50.775 --> 00:53.375
not to break your word.

00:53.411 --> 00:54.543
I trusted you.

00:54.579 --> 00:57.178
Just like you
should trust

00:57.214 --> 00:59.547
that I won't turn you
over to the authorities

00:59.583 --> 01:02.251
for smuggling arms
for the Sun On Yee triad...

01:02.287 --> 01:04.120
or to your wife
for the waitress

01:04.156 --> 01:06.425
you're seeing on the side...
Nina, is it?

01:08.460 --> 01:09.591
I mean, how would
little Rissa feel,

01:09.627 --> 01:11.359
knowing that you cheated
on her mother?

01:11.395 --> 01:13.261
Growing up with
a father in prison?

01:13.297 --> 01:14.763
I mean, assuming, of course,

01:14.799 --> 01:17.268
the Sun On Yee triad
don't get to you first.

01:19.437 --> 01:20.769
Words are very powerful things

01:20.805 --> 01:22.775
so I suggest you choose
your next ones carefully.

01:25.177 --> 01:28.210
30 million.

01:28.246 --> 01:29.582
Thank you for
your business.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.291 --> 01:40.689
Any problems?

01:40.725 --> 01:42.525
Nothing a little
conversation couldn't fix.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.627
Well done.

01:45.663 --> 01:50.565
$300 million
in untraceable diamonds.

01:50.601 --> 01:51.901
Better than cash.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.401
I can't help but feel
like we're getting

01:53.437 --> 01:54.870
the deal of the century
at this price.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.641
Bruyere has no idea how
valuable his land really is.

01:58.677 --> 01:59.874
But he will.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.776
And when he does
he won't be happy.

02:01.812 --> 02:05.284
So, how does it feel to be standing
on the right side of history?

02:08.219 --> 02:09.883
It's good to have
you on board, Tom.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.623
Let's go!

02:21.633 --> 02:22.797
You're my best friend.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.235
You should've cared
about me more.

02:26.805 --> 02:28.503
I made a mistake.

02:28.539 --> 02:31.674
This is the only relationship
I can have with you right now.

02:31.710 --> 02:32.945
I'm in love with you.

02:34.379 --> 02:35.343
I'm engaged.

02:37.414 --> 02:38.914
Where was this
two years ago?

02:47.791 --> 02:48.893
What?!

02:53.031 --> 02:54.963
Understood.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.665
This is Gali Grant from the U.S.
Attorney's Office.

02:57.701 --> 02:59.401
She's gonna be helping us
with the Crawford case.

02:59.437 --> 03:01.670
That is, if you have a case.
Tell me about this tip.

03:01.706 --> 03:03.706
Our sources told us that
Crawford is meeting

03:03.742 --> 03:05.841
Jean-Paul Bruyere
at a charity gala.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.009
Bruyere plus Crawford
equals Crawford hashtag.

03:08.045 --> 03:09.712
That hashtag means checkmate.

03:09.748 --> 03:11.379
He's saying
"Crawford Checkmate."

03:11.415 --> 03:12.814
And Bruyere is?

03:12.850 --> 03:16.418
A corrupt businessman from
Belgium who's been suspected

03:16.454 --> 03:19.855
of money laundering,
tax evasion, insider trading...

03:19.891 --> 03:23.525
Suspected? So corrupt is more
of a theory at this point.

03:23.561 --> 03:26.594
This meet could be the key to
catching Crawford in a criminal act.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.896
Look, I get it.
You know Crawford's bad.

03:28.932 --> 03:32.033
You know he financed Sandstorm and bought
off Hirst and has had many people killed.

03:32.069 --> 03:34.535
But knowing these things
and proving them in court

03:34.571 --> 03:36.872
are entirely separate matters.
You need evidence.

03:36.908 --> 03:37.906
With all due respect,

03:37.942 --> 03:39.374
we do know how
to build a case.

03:39.410 --> 03:40.943
It's kind of what
we do around here.

03:40.979 --> 03:42.711
I'm just saying, you
got a witness whose story

03:42.747 --> 03:45.614
comes up short or a shaky chain
of custody, we're screwed.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.950
So if this meeting
really is something,

03:47.986 --> 03:50.589
it could be your only shot.
Don't blow it.

03:52.891 --> 03:54.422
Well, she's a joy.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.859
Yeah, well,
you guys heard her.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.861
Weller, Jane, zero in
on Bruyere and Crawford.

03:58.897 --> 04:00.562
Figure out what they could
want from each other.

04:00.598 --> 04:02.630
Okay, so, what do we know
about Blake's gala?

04:02.666 --> 04:04.766
Well, according to the
invitation, guests are

04:04.802 --> 04:06.502
instructed to fly into
Dubrovnik, Croatia,

04:06.538 --> 04:08.303
but it's all we know.

04:08.339 --> 04:10.639
Blake does this every year
to keep the paparazzi away.

04:10.675 --> 04:13.442
Once the guests arrive
at the designated airport,

04:13.478 --> 04:15.743
they're then shuttled
to the top secret location.

04:15.779 --> 04:17.916
All right, do whatever it takes
to find it.

04:23.087 --> 04:25.421
Hey, look at this.

04:25.457 --> 04:27.993
Bruyere declared himself
bankrupt four years ago.

04:30.527 --> 04:32.493
Hey, we got your message.
Is everything okay?

04:32.529 --> 04:34.063
I've been thinking
about what you said.

04:34.099 --> 04:37.065
The more we work together,
the faster we get Crawford.

04:37.101 --> 04:41.102
So, I dug around online,
went through my family's

04:41.138 --> 04:43.505
cloud accounts,
my dad's calendar.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.840
This is every snapshot,
travel itinerary,

04:45.876 --> 04:48.713
and message that
has to do with Hank Crawford.

04:49.948 --> 04:51.479
That's great.

04:51.515 --> 04:53.782
We'll get our analysts
on that right away.

04:53.818 --> 04:57.385
Wait, what do you mean?
You said "work together."

04:57.421 --> 04:59.988
Where's the together part?

05:00.024 --> 05:02.457
Look, I really
appreciate this.

05:02.493 --> 05:04.493
But we are racing
the clock, chasing a lead

05:04.529 --> 05:05.693
that could bring
Crawford down today.

05:05.729 --> 05:07.929
So let me help!
That man is responsible

05:07.965 --> 05:09.097
for my dad's death,
I know it.

05:09.133 --> 05:11.933
It's too dangerous,
I'm sorry.

05:11.969 --> 05:16.070
We're get our lab techs
on this immediately.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.440
But right now there's
nothing more you can do.

05:18.476 --> 05:21.113
Head back to the safe house.
We'll keep you posted.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.820
Wait, why do you have
a picture of this yacht?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.119
Do you know that yacht?

05:31.155 --> 05:34.390
Know it? Two years ago I spent
most of spring break on it.

05:34.426 --> 05:35.957
Are you sure?

05:35.993 --> 05:39.527
Yeah, it's called "Sea-Duction"
I think I'd remember that.

05:39.563 --> 05:41.897
I was with my parents,
the Crawfords,

05:41.933 --> 05:43.431
and the couple
who owned it.

05:43.467 --> 05:44.666
A couple?

05:44.702 --> 05:47.101
That's Bruyere's boat.

05:47.137 --> 05:48.669
We've got no record
of him having a wife.

05:48.705 --> 05:51.005
Yeah, they
weren't exactly married.

05:51.041 --> 05:54.409
Her name was Allison
or Ali something?

05:54.445 --> 05:57.412
All I remember is my dad telling me to be
nice to them because they were important.

05:57.448 --> 05:59.448
There was an Allison
on Patterson's

05:59.484 --> 06:01.854
person of interest list, um...

06:04.988 --> 06:06.188
Here...

06:06.224 --> 06:08.424
That's her.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.758
She used to be a redhead.

06:09.794 --> 06:11.794
Allison Ornstein.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.662
She flew into
Dubrovnik today.

06:13.698 --> 06:15.164
And so that confirms
Roman's intel.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.733
If she's going to the gala,
Bruyere probably is too.

06:17.769 --> 06:19.571
We'll let you know
when we find out more.

06:21.806 --> 06:24.072
This is so stupid.

06:24.108 --> 06:26.912
Avery...

06:31.049 --> 06:32.914
Look, Jane...

06:32.950 --> 06:36.784
You're probably gonna
hate hearing this...

06:36.820 --> 06:40.022
Do you remember when
I used to try to bench you

06:40.058 --> 06:42.858
for your own safety
and how that felt?

06:42.894 --> 06:45.760
If you don't loosen your grip,
you're gonna drive her away.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.695
I don't want
her getting hurt.

06:47.731 --> 06:49.498
I understand that.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.601
But she's wired just like you.

06:52.637 --> 06:55.641
That's what I'm afraid of.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.111
Hey, you comin'?

07:04.147 --> 07:05.746
What?

07:05.782 --> 07:07.049
Are you avoiding me

07:07.085 --> 07:09.251
- because of what happened?
- What? No!

07:09.287 --> 07:11.053
You were late to the briefing
this morning, and now Patterson

07:11.089 --> 07:12.955
texted us five minutes ago
and you're just sitting here.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.655
I didn't get
a text message.

07:14.691 --> 07:17.558
There must be something
wrong with my phone.

07:17.594 --> 07:20.065
Well, that's weird, you're
not on the text chain.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.131
Patterson's freezing you out.

07:25.969 --> 07:27.702
That's like seventh grade
all over again.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.705
Look, this is work.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.138
Whatever personal stuff Patterson
has with you and Borden...

07:31.174 --> 07:32.844
You can't blame her.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.814
I'll handle it.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.887
Patterson, what you got?

07:44.923 --> 07:49.157
Uh, turns out Bruyere's
girlfriend, Allison Ornstein,

07:49.193 --> 07:51.626
is also a known associate
to an elusive

07:51.662 --> 07:52.928
terrorist leader
called "The Serpent."

07:52.964 --> 07:54.529
What do we know about him?

07:54.565 --> 07:56.231
That he's managed to stay
anonymous despite

07:56.267 --> 07:58.599
being the mastermind
behind some of the deadliest

07:58.635 --> 08:00.068
terrorist attacks
in recent history.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.537
Yeah, the Stockholm
suicide bombing,

08:01.573 --> 08:02.803
the Taipei sarin attack.

08:02.839 --> 08:04.138
They're both rumored
to be his handiwork.

08:04.174 --> 08:05.907
So, what's Allison's
connection to him?

08:05.943 --> 08:08.243
Well, according
to her CIA dossier,

08:08.279 --> 08:10.178
she travels to the target
cities usually 48 hours

08:10.214 --> 08:11.914
before The Serpent's
attacks took place.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.214
So she's his accomplice.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.750
Any leads on
The Serpent's whereabouts?

08:14.786 --> 08:17.018
No, the CIA trail
died four years ago.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.154
That's around the same time
Bruyere went bankrupt.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.655
You think
there's a connection?

08:20.691 --> 08:22.157
Seems awfully coincidental.

08:22.193 --> 08:24.926
The Serpent goes dormant the
same time Bruyere goes broke.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.029
The Serpent's terror group was suspected
of running camps in the Congo.

08:28.065 --> 08:29.864
Bruyere has
land holdings there.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.767
Bruyere's The Serpent,
it's gotta be him.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.668
What the hell's Crawford
doing meeting with terrorists?

08:33.703 --> 08:36.138
Whoa, I don't know but
he just liquidated

08:36.174 --> 08:38.339
$300 million worth of assets.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.841
What if Crawford is funding The
Serpent's next terror attack?

08:40.876 --> 08:43.177
This has to be what
Roman meant by his text.

08:43.212 --> 08:45.113
Bruyere plus Crawford
equals Checkmate.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.815
This is our shot.
We take down

08:46.851 --> 08:49.317
one of the world's most
dangerous terrorists.

08:49.353 --> 08:51.586
And we take Crawford
down with him.

08:56.618 --> 09:01.618
Subtitles by explosiveskull

09:05.738 --> 09:07.504
Any leads on Blake's gala?

09:07.540 --> 09:11.073
Uh, I poked around Blake's usual
party planner, Ilana Isakow.

09:11.109 --> 09:14.743
But she decided to go with someone
different this time around.

09:14.779 --> 09:16.346
Someone with
a lot more security.

09:16.382 --> 09:17.546
So, who's she using?

09:17.582 --> 09:19.915
Uh, someone named
Vanessa Baker.

09:19.951 --> 09:21.083
As in <i>the</i> Vanessa Baker?

09:21.119 --> 09:22.651
You know her?

09:22.687 --> 09:25.020
She wrote the holy grail
of wedding planning books.

09:25.056 --> 09:26.555
At least, according to Meg.

09:26.591 --> 09:28.357
Vanessa would
know the location,

09:28.393 --> 09:30.894
who's attending,
all security protocols.

09:30.930 --> 09:34.430
For sure, but she's built her
whole reputation on discretion.

09:34.466 --> 09:35.964
Probably
why Blake went with her.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.334
Come on, Patterson,
surely you can crack

09:38.370 --> 09:39.568
into some wedding
planner's hard drive?

09:39.604 --> 09:42.371
Yeah, I need proximity
to her computer.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.006
Ideally a spot
with public WiFi.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.443
I could set up a router
to hijack the signal,

09:46.479 --> 09:47.610
known as a pineapple hack.

09:47.646 --> 09:49.346
Sounds delicious.

09:49.382 --> 09:50.880
You two up for a little
bit of undercover work?

09:50.916 --> 09:52.448
- I nominate you, groomzilla.
- Ahh.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.784
You might get some free
tips for your wedding.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.487
We could use more time to dig
into Crawford and Bruyere.

09:57.523 --> 09:58.954
Right.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.790
- Uh, guess that leaves you and me.
- Guess so.

10:01.826 --> 10:04.093
Patterson, get us
on Vanessa's calendar ASAP.

10:04.129 --> 10:05.898
Do whatever it takes, all right?

10:10.936 --> 10:13.370
- Well, this is...
- Incredibly awkward.

10:13.406 --> 10:14.703
I, I never would have...

10:14.739 --> 10:16.805
Let's not talk
about this right now.

10:16.841 --> 10:19.074
Head's up.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.077
- You must Joe.
- Yes.

10:21.113 --> 10:23.813
And Lee? Soon to be Epstein...

10:23.849 --> 10:25.115
Thanks for fitting us in, Ms.
Baker.

10:25.151 --> 10:26.849
Oh, please, call me Vanessa.

10:26.885 --> 10:29.017
What I like to do

10:29.053 --> 10:31.954
is really get to know a couple
before we work together.

10:31.990 --> 10:33.122
Tell me about the first time

10:33.158 --> 10:35.991
you realized you
had feelings for her.

10:36.027 --> 10:38.862
Before that,
I would love to see

10:38.898 --> 10:40.396
some of the photographs
from your website.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.031
Right down to business.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.168
We're gonna get along
great, you and me.

10:45.204 --> 10:47.569
Yeah, there was one picture that
caught my eye in particular.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.575
- The event at The Plaza.
- Ahh.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.977
While she's looking, let's
get into the nitty-gritty.

10:54.013 --> 10:55.944
Have you chosen
your best man yet?

10:55.980 --> 10:58.548
I have, my best friend
who also happens to be a woman.

10:58.584 --> 11:00.150
Well, that's a mistake.

11:00.186 --> 11:01.818
I've done a lot of these.

11:01.854 --> 11:05.023
Trust me, pick a guy otherwise
it gets real complicated.

11:07.692 --> 11:10.526
Uh, Vanessa, what do you think
of a Roaring '20s theme?

11:10.562 --> 11:12.194
I love a theme wedding.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.496
Do you have any ideas
off the top of your head?

11:14.532 --> 11:16.565
Model T's to take the guests

11:16.601 --> 11:18.568
between the wedding venue
and the reception.

11:18.604 --> 11:21.871
Prohibition-themed cocktails,
flappers serving hors d'oeuvres.

11:21.907 --> 11:23.972
Sounds fun!

11:24.008 --> 11:26.041
Can you tell us how
you handle security?

11:26.077 --> 11:28.977
We have a number of pretty
high-profile guests.

11:29.013 --> 11:32.147
I hand-select
my security specialists.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.217
Most are former
military contractors.

11:34.253 --> 11:36.986
You won't need to worry.

11:37.022 --> 11:38.755
You two are going to make
gorgeous children.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.222
How many kids
are you thinking?

11:40.258 --> 11:43.159
Oh, you know what?
That is work and I have to go.

11:43.195 --> 11:44.961
I totally understand.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.697
Now that we've met,
I get the couple dynamic.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.833
She's the driver,
you're the passenger.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.970
Indeed, thank you, Vanessa.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.139
So what did you get?

11:56.175 --> 11:58.708
Vanessa's hard drive
was a gold mine.

11:58.744 --> 12:01.110
For starters, I know
what Roman's been up to.

12:01.146 --> 12:03.612
He's Head of Security
for Hank Crawford.

12:03.648 --> 12:05.615
Goes by the name
of Tom Jakeman.

12:05.651 --> 12:07.583
That's how he knows the
details to Blake's gala.

12:07.619 --> 12:09.251
Yeah, and he's been
liaising with Vanessa,

12:09.287 --> 12:11.487
setting up all the security
protocols for the event.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.222
If that's true, he'll
definitely be there.

12:13.258 --> 12:14.924
We can arrest Crawford,
Bruyere and Roman.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.593
Okay, so, gala location.

12:17.629 --> 12:20.929
It's at a secluded mansion
on the island of Korcula,

12:20.965 --> 12:23.833
one of the Dalmatian Islands
off the coast of Croatia.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.035
Nice, let's warm up the jet.

12:26.071 --> 12:27.837
Crawford can't see us coming.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.539
Because of Hirst, we need to
assume that he knows who we are.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.541
Is anyone else worried that
this is one big Roman trap

12:32.577 --> 12:34.577
we're about to walk into?

12:34.613 --> 12:36.179
Crawford's about to put
a known terrorist back in play.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.146
I mean, trap or no trap,
we have to stop Bruyere

12:38.182 --> 12:39.948
before he can fund
another attack.

12:39.984 --> 12:42.584
Kurt's right. If we get
eyes on that deal,

12:42.620 --> 12:44.654
Crawford and Bruyere,
it's over for them.

12:44.690 --> 12:45.921
And once it is,
we take down Roman.

12:45.957 --> 12:47.289
Patterson, I want
you to figure out

12:47.325 --> 12:49.192
every possible way
on and off that island.

12:49.228 --> 12:50.959
We're not let this guy slip
out of our fingers again.

12:50.995 --> 12:53.829
I'll get started on
backstopped identities, but...

12:53.865 --> 12:56.533
Vanessa's security
protocols are intense.

12:56.569 --> 12:58.601
It would be a lot easier to
sneak in if we already had

12:58.637 --> 13:01.169
an inside man that
was cleared to be there.

13:01.205 --> 13:03.305
Too bad we don't know
anybody on that invite list.

13:03.341 --> 13:04.710
We do know someone.

13:07.812 --> 13:10.045
Could've saved me a trip
back to the safe house.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.914
So what's so urgent?

13:11.950 --> 13:13.849
Uh, okay, so we
know that you and Blake

13:13.885 --> 13:15.852
spent a lot of time
together in your childhood.

13:15.888 --> 13:18.855
Well, we weren't best friends
but she looked out for me.

13:18.891 --> 13:20.055
Kind of like a big sister

13:20.091 --> 13:21.690
whenever our families
traveled together.

13:21.726 --> 13:23.592
Why? What's that have
to do with anything?

13:23.628 --> 13:26.929
Think you could score an invitation
to Blake's annual charity gala?

13:26.965 --> 13:31.000
Sure, yeah, Blake tried to connect a
bunch of times after my father died.

13:31.036 --> 13:33.136
Avery, there's another
part to our plan.

13:33.172 --> 13:34.337
We need you to attend the gala

13:34.373 --> 13:36.039
to get the team
in through a back door.

13:36.075 --> 13:39.575
Oh, like sneaking
into a movie. I'm in!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.977
Avery, I wanna make sure you
understand what this could mean.

13:42.013 --> 13:44.280
You may see Crawford
and Bruyere,

13:44.316 --> 13:46.915
and there's a good chance
Roman will be there.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.017
I'll be fine.
I can handle myself.

13:49.053 --> 13:50.987
We will be guiding you with
the comms the whole way through.

13:51.023 --> 13:54.057
And you will have a tracker
in case something goes wrong.

13:54.093 --> 13:55.692
Lemme guess...
The tracker is your idea.

13:55.728 --> 13:57.894
It's for your protection.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.695
I'll stay with Zapata and Patterson.
We'll run point from here.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.363
Actually, I think I should go.

14:01.399 --> 14:03.031
You should have CIA presence.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.001
Fine, Patterson, we'll get
you an alias, too.

14:05.037 --> 14:06.836
But remember what Grant said.

14:06.872 --> 14:08.871
We need hard evidence of a deal
between Bruyere and Crawford.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.939
Anything less and these guys
will slip through our fingers.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.308
So, we take down Bruyere
and Crawford first,

14:12.344 --> 14:13.713
and then we move onto Roman.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.160
Avery, you all right?

14:31.196 --> 14:32.895
I'm fine.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.167
Okay, Avery,
head to your right.

14:37.436 --> 14:40.203
Now go through
the last door on the left.

14:40.239 --> 14:41.673
<i>Try not to be seen.</i>

14:45.043 --> 14:46.208
<i>Keep going down the hall</i>

14:46.244 --> 14:48.645
until you get to a door
at the very end.

14:48.681 --> 14:50.917
<i>That's the one
you'll need to open for us.</i>

14:52.350 --> 14:54.250
It's blocked.

14:54.286 --> 14:58.391
<i>Okay, uh, let me try to find
another option, hang tight.</i>

14:59.992 --> 15:01.924
Wait, there's a window.
I think I can reach it.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.291
No, Avery, don't.

15:03.327 --> 15:05.227
<i>Wait for Patterson.
If someone sees you...</i>

15:05.263 --> 15:06.865
Hey, what are you doing?!

15:12.413 --> 15:14.412
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is a restricted area.

15:14.448 --> 15:16.248
I'm sorry... I, I... I just...

15:16.284 --> 15:18.416
Tell him you were
being followed.

15:18.452 --> 15:21.420
There was a guy...
he was following me.

15:21.456 --> 15:23.120
I guess I took a wrong turn.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.357
Okay, make him
empathize with you.

15:25.393 --> 15:27.225
He's been eyeing me
since I got here.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.961
I thought he was gonna hurt me
so I ran and he followed me.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.596
I was just looking for
a way out, I panicked.

15:31.632 --> 15:33.165
What did he look like?

15:33.201 --> 15:37.035
Bald, pale, old, like 40.

15:37.071 --> 15:39.238
Not old...
I know that's not old.

15:39.274 --> 15:41.138
Older than me, I meant.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.641
I'll alert the security team.

15:42.677 --> 15:44.442
There's an elevator around
the corner to the right.

15:44.478 --> 15:46.143
Take it up to the main floor
back to the party.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.211
That's the safest
place to be.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.282
Thank you so much.

15:50.018 --> 15:51.950
Good thinking
under pressure.

15:51.986 --> 15:53.618
Thanks for the assist.

15:53.654 --> 15:56.220
You guys can get into
the window, I unlocked it.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.556
Nice work.

15:57.592 --> 15:59.958
We'll meet you
back in the van.

15:59.994 --> 16:01.296
Time to head in.

16:16.644 --> 16:19.978
On the main floor.
No sign of Crawford or Bruyere.

16:20.014 --> 16:21.979
Or Roman.

16:22.015 --> 16:26.084
<i>Jane, 3:00.</i>

16:26.120 --> 16:29.124
Meet me at the bar.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.497
I'm heading to the
surveillance room.

16:39.967 --> 16:40.998
I'm glad you're here.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.468
I know it's been
rough lately.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.403
For what it's worth,

16:45.439 --> 16:47.071
I understand why
you did what you did.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.706
- Look, we don't have to...
- No, I'm just saying...

16:48.742 --> 16:50.408
I've been in your shoes.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.277
Forced to lie to the people
I care about the most.

16:52.313 --> 16:56.214
<i>But at the end of the day,
we're family.</i>

16:56.250 --> 16:59.051
<i>Families forgive.</i>

16:59.087 --> 17:00.952
<i>You forgave me when
I lied to you and the team.</i>

17:00.988 --> 17:03.387
Yeah, after I shot you.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.691
And even then I didn't
like you for a while.

17:06.727 --> 17:09.096
<i>I don't know if
I deserve to be forgiven.</i>

17:11.298 --> 17:13.131
Everyone in position?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.633
Yeah, uh, Weller,
Jane and Zapata

17:15.669 --> 17:17.134
are in the building and...

17:17.170 --> 17:19.237
Avery is in the van
with her detail.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.376
Okay, now we wait.

17:23.777 --> 17:26.580
So how long do you plan on cutting
Zapata out of our briefings?

17:29.283 --> 17:31.682
I don't call Keaton
every time I have a lead.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.317
Why should I call her?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.053
Because she's a part
of this joint task force,

17:35.089 --> 17:36.654
and we don't compartmentalize
information.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.023
Oh, you mean the way
she kept the fact

17:38.059 --> 17:40.358
that Borden was
still alive from us?

17:40.394 --> 17:42.259
We don't know half the things
that she does with the CIA.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.729
But she knows
everything we do.

17:43.765 --> 17:46.064
Are you seriously telling me
you still trust her?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.266
You're angry, I get it.
We all feel betrayed.

17:48.302 --> 17:50.102
But we have to move on.

17:50.138 --> 17:51.737
If this team is gonna function,
I'm gonna need you to work

17:51.773 --> 17:55.043
with her the same way you
always have, understood?

18:05.319 --> 18:07.222
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I'm the new guy.

18:15.129 --> 18:16.394
<i>According to this invoice,</i>

18:16.430 --> 18:18.796
Vanessa had a very
large safe flown in.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.065
Could be related to
Crawford and Bruyere's deal.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.667
Might be where they're gonna keep
the goods they plan on trading.

18:22.703 --> 18:25.370
Weller, uh, you got eyes
on the monitors?

18:25.406 --> 18:26.704
<i>We're looking for
a large room with a safe.</i>

18:26.740 --> 18:28.606
Copy that.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.544
Okay... this is super not good.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.146
Avery's detail just texted.
She slipped out of the van.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.781
What?
How the hell did that happen?

18:36.817 --> 18:38.383
I don't know, but it did.

18:38.419 --> 18:40.352
What about her tracker?
Is it on?

18:40.388 --> 18:43.454
The signal keeps going in and out,
there's some kind of interference.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.823
I've got eyes on Crawford.

18:44.859 --> 18:47.592
- Is he with Bruyere?
- <i>No, it's a woman.</i>

18:47.628 --> 18:50.528
I haven't got a good angle.

18:50.564 --> 18:51.762
It's Avery.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.332
Avery? Can you hear me?

18:54.368 --> 18:57.068
- Move away from Crawford now.
- She's not moving.

18:57.104 --> 18:59.237
She's ignoring me.
I'm going in.

18:59.273 --> 19:01.306
No, Crawford might
recognize you.

19:01.342 --> 19:03.174
Jane, stand down.
Do you copy?

19:03.210 --> 19:06.644
<i>Jane, stop! Jane!</i>

19:06.680 --> 19:08.447
<i>Weller, Zapata,
hold your positions.</i>

19:08.483 --> 19:10.685
<i>We can't risk him
making all three of you.</i>

19:12.352 --> 19:15.319
I am so sorry
for your loss, Avery.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.654
Your father was a good man.

19:16.690 --> 19:19.257
Thanks.

19:19.293 --> 19:21.526
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to see you again.

19:21.562 --> 19:23.194
There were some things
I wanted to ask.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.429
Of course, anything.

19:24.465 --> 19:27.231
What do you know about
my dad's suicide?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.634
Um...

19:30.670 --> 19:34.439
To be honest, not much.

19:34.475 --> 19:37.409
I was shocked and
I was saddened at the news.

19:37.445 --> 19:41.546
I knew he was unhappy when you
let him go but I never really...

19:41.582 --> 19:43.280
Uh, no, your father and I...

19:43.316 --> 19:45.450
We agreed mutually that
it was time to part ways.

19:45.486 --> 19:47.184
That's not how he told it.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.122
Avery...
Avery, there you are.

19:50.158 --> 19:53.160
Uh, I was wanting to introduce
you to some former colleagues.

19:54.728 --> 19:56.260
Hank Crawford
and you are?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.528
Lindsay Russo.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.265
Lindsay and I worked
in Venezuela last year.

20:00.301 --> 20:02.901
I started a microcredit
bank for women.

20:02.937 --> 20:05.136
And Avery worked
for me over the summer.

20:05.172 --> 20:06.604
Oh, well, then you should
meet my daughter, Blake.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.540
She runs my charitable
organization.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.375
And Blake's always
looking out for

20:11.411 --> 20:13.411
new avenues
to empower women.

20:13.447 --> 20:15.881
Oh, well hopefully,
I'll run into her.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.781
Um, we should go,
my friends are waiting.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.720
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:21.656 --> 20:24.155
Hold on!

20:24.191 --> 20:26.324
- Have you seen Blake?
- Not recently.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.761
Okay, uh, this is Tom Jakeman.
He's my Head of Security.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.165
And also my daughter's
boyfriend.

20:34.201 --> 20:36.433
And Tom,
this is Lindsay Russo

20:36.469 --> 20:38.636
and Avery Drabkin.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.742
G'day, pleasure to meet you.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.608
Avery's father was a loyal
employee of HCI Global.

20:50.644 --> 20:52.110
He was a good friend.

20:52.146 --> 20:53.343
Tom was it?

20:53.379 --> 20:55.580
- So you're Blake's boyfriend?
- I am.

20:55.616 --> 20:57.015
Any idea where she is?

20:57.051 --> 20:58.216
She's gonna be thrilled
to see you.

20:58.252 --> 20:59.350
You know what?
I think I saw her

20:59.386 --> 21:00.551
talking to some
guests in the foyer.

21:00.587 --> 21:02.757
Why don't you
ladies follow me.

21:08.294 --> 21:09.627
You look good
as a blonde, sis.

21:09.663 --> 21:11.329
And you clean up nice, too.

21:11.365 --> 21:13.631
Compared to what, being
kidnapped and kept in a hole?

21:13.667 --> 21:15.265
A necessary evil.

21:15.301 --> 21:17.634
You used your own niece
to manipulate me.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.336
You're gonna rot in prison,
you son of a...

21:19.372 --> 21:21.205
Avery.

21:21.241 --> 21:22.606
We gotta get Avery
off the floor.

21:22.642 --> 21:24.175
She's a liability out there.

21:24.211 --> 21:25.810
No, they're in it now.
This might be our chance

21:25.846 --> 21:28.112
to figure out what the
hell Crawford's up to.

21:28.148 --> 21:31.082
I know the circumstances
are a little awkward,

21:31.118 --> 21:33.418
but it's nice to
see you two together again.

21:33.454 --> 21:36.153
Give me one reason why I
shouldn't arrest you right now.

21:36.189 --> 21:38.589
Because you're
not here for me.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.123
You guys have
figured out by now

21:40.159 --> 21:41.758
that Crawford is
a much bigger target.

21:41.794 --> 21:43.527
He's a bigger player
than you can even imagine

21:43.563 --> 21:46.464
and the only way you get him
is with my help.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.499
These new tattoos, pitting us
against each other,

21:49.535 --> 21:52.536
exposing Hirst,
this was all to catch one man?

21:52.572 --> 21:54.839
What the hell did
he do to you?

21:54.875 --> 21:56.506
Crawford's ruined
countless lives,

21:56.542 --> 21:59.410
killed innocent people and...
he's just getting started.

21:59.446 --> 22:00.777
That's it?

22:00.813 --> 22:03.346
You suddenly you care
about other people?

22:03.382 --> 22:04.681
There's gotta be more.

22:04.717 --> 22:07.651
Now is not the time or place
to get into motives.

22:07.687 --> 22:10.554
<i>He needs to be stopped,
that's what matters.</i>

22:10.590 --> 22:12.422
Weller, Crawford's on the move.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.325
<i>I can see that.
There's no sign of Bruyere.</i>

22:15.361 --> 22:17.495
<i>Are you guys
getting that static?</i>

22:17.531 --> 22:18.629
No, you're coming
in clear.

22:18.665 --> 22:19.834
<i>Must just be on my end.</i>

22:22.136 --> 22:26.307
Just got eyes on Blake. I'll keep
her away from Jane and Roman.

22:29.376 --> 22:31.708
So you're dating Blake just
to get close to Crawford?

22:31.744 --> 22:33.276
Using her like
you used us?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.845
Or is she wrapped
up in this, too?

22:34.881 --> 22:37.547
She has no idea what kind
of man her father is.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.249
She's not a part of this.

22:39.285 --> 22:41.352
She thinks your name is Tom
and you're Australian.

22:41.388 --> 22:44.221
You've kind of made her
a part of it.

22:44.257 --> 22:46.123
Why is Crawford
meeting with Bruyere?

22:46.159 --> 22:47.190
He's buying land from him.

22:47.226 --> 22:48.692
He bought $300 million

22:48.728 --> 22:50.660
in untraceable diamonds
to make the purchase.

22:50.696 --> 22:52.229
And why is the land
so important?

22:52.265 --> 22:54.265
It doesn't matter.

22:54.301 --> 22:56.566
Once he's arrested for dealing
with a known terrorist,

22:56.602 --> 22:59.871
he won't be able
to use it anyway.

22:59.907 --> 23:03.708
You guys did figure out
who Bruyere really is, right?

23:03.744 --> 23:06.177
I'll look into the diamonds,
confirm his story.

23:06.213 --> 23:09.183
Yeah, and figure out what
land he's talking about.

23:11.318 --> 23:12.682
I can get you
evidence of the deal.

23:12.718 --> 23:14.252
What kind of evidence?

23:14.288 --> 23:15.620
The kind that puts
him away for good.

23:15.656 --> 23:18.488
There's no way Crawford
squirms out of this one.

23:18.524 --> 23:20.557
The deal is going down
in a secure room.

23:20.593 --> 23:22.459
But you can get
your FBI cameras in there

23:22.495 --> 23:23.861
and record the whole thing.

23:23.897 --> 23:25.295
You think
he's telling the truth?

23:25.331 --> 23:26.631
<i>There's gotta be a catch.</i>

23:26.667 --> 23:27.899
So why do we need you?

23:27.935 --> 23:29.270
You just gave
everything away.

23:31.605 --> 23:33.704
It's uncanny... you sound
just like your mother.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.339
Well, she's right.

23:35.375 --> 23:36.908
What are you
not telling us?

23:36.944 --> 23:39.310
Well, the room's outfitted
with an electromagnetic net

23:39.346 --> 23:41.512
that blocks all audio
and video recording.

23:41.548 --> 23:44.247
You control the net.

23:44.283 --> 23:46.717
Cooperate and I'll turn it off,
allowing you to film everything.

23:46.753 --> 23:48.285
But if you don't play nice...

23:48.321 --> 23:50.254
You have a kill switch
that cuts our feed.

23:50.290 --> 23:51.621
Sharp as always.

23:51.657 --> 23:53.658
That's why you need me.

23:53.694 --> 23:55.392
You can override
that, right?

23:55.428 --> 23:57.327
Oh, sure, if I had a magic
machine that could tell

23:57.363 --> 23:59.429
what kind of net he's using,
what frequency it is,

23:59.465 --> 24:00.898
how he's wired it
and the ability

24:00.934 --> 24:03.668
to teleport to Croatia,
not a problem.

24:03.704 --> 24:05.303
So that's a strong maybe.

24:15.549 --> 24:17.215
Are you okay?

24:17.251 --> 24:19.917
Oh, my God...
you're Blake Crawford.

24:19.953 --> 24:21.919
I'm so embarrassed.

24:21.955 --> 24:23.987
This is your event.

24:24.023 --> 24:27.257
Oh, please, I can't
count the number of times

24:27.293 --> 24:29.927
that I've hid in the bathroom
at one of my own parties.

24:29.963 --> 24:31.661
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm Julie Paige.

24:31.697 --> 24:32.996
I work for Tracy Zaslow

24:33.032 --> 24:35.466
at the Friedman Foundation
for Clean Air.

24:35.502 --> 24:37.301
Tracy, of course.

24:37.337 --> 24:38.936
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Julie.

24:38.972 --> 24:41.005
You know, I've been told

24:41.041 --> 24:43.940
that I'm a pretty good
listener if you want to talk.

24:43.976 --> 24:47.311
And if you don't want to spill
your guts to a total stranger,

24:47.347 --> 24:50.247
I can also point out which bartender
makes the best Moscow Mules.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.484
Just lost Zapata's signal.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.652
Between Roman's net
and this old mansion's walls,

24:55.688 --> 24:56.853
there's a lot of dead spots.

24:56.889 --> 24:58.389
Well, get it back.

24:58.425 --> 25:01.324
Crawford and Bruyere
will meet

25:01.360 --> 25:03.361
during dinner
in the secure room.

25:03.397 --> 25:04.996
Second Floor, Room Five.

25:05.032 --> 25:08.733
When I see you approaching,
I'll unlock the door remotely.

25:08.769 --> 25:10.838
And we should
trust you because...

25:15.908 --> 25:17.408
Well, you know me, sis.

25:17.444 --> 25:19.342
You really think I'd go
through all this trouble

25:19.378 --> 25:21.579
just to kill you
and your little FBI team?

25:21.615 --> 25:26.284
I think you've lost
sight of who you are, Tom.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.888
That's a helluva thing
for you to say to me.

25:32.091 --> 25:33.623
I know exactly who I am.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.860
You're the one trying
to be someone else.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.594
But you will always be Remi.

25:37.630 --> 25:39.529
Whether you like it or not.

25:39.565 --> 25:43.534
You're wrong,
Remi's dead.

25:43.570 --> 25:46.304
I got the chance to start over,
and I chose this life

25:46.340 --> 25:49.939
away from you, fighting for
what's right, protecting people.

25:49.975 --> 25:52.575
Boy, did you ever drink
the Kurt Weller Kool-Aid.

25:52.611 --> 25:55.579
<i>The brother I loved,
the person I trusted</i>

25:55.615 --> 25:58.849
most in this world might've
made the same choice once.

25:58.885 --> 26:00.383
But now he's gone.

26:00.419 --> 26:02.486
I don't know who you are.

26:02.522 --> 26:06.090
Well...

26:06.126 --> 26:10.093
I guess you've got
a coin to flip then.

26:10.129 --> 26:12.330
Dinner starts in 15 minutes.

26:12.366 --> 26:13.596
Good luck.

26:13.632 --> 26:15.065
You're just gonna
let him walk away?!

26:15.101 --> 26:17.034
We're here for Crawford.

26:17.070 --> 26:18.569
We lose sight of that,
we have nothing.

26:18.605 --> 26:20.871
Crawford and Bruyere
first, then Roman.

26:20.907 --> 26:21.939
We can get all three.

26:21.975 --> 26:25.342
- How? We can't just...
- Yes, we can.

26:25.378 --> 26:26.944
Your emotions are
clouding your judgment.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.679
You nearly compromised the
entire op by ditching the van

26:29.715 --> 26:31.082
and talking to Crawford
in the first place.

26:31.118 --> 26:34.051
If it wasn't for me, none
of you would even be here.

26:34.087 --> 26:36.454
Or have a way of following
Roman right now.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.060
I slipped my tracker onto him
while you two were talking.

26:41.927 --> 26:44.428
That was very dangerous.

26:44.464 --> 26:46.496
- What would've happened if he...
- He didn't.

26:46.532 --> 26:50.601
And now when he tries to get
away, he won't get very far.

26:50.637 --> 26:51.701
All right...

26:51.737 --> 26:53.103
- Avery, I just...
- Let me guess.

26:53.139 --> 26:55.105
You're gonna tell me to go
sit in the van now, right?

26:55.141 --> 26:57.644
I'll save you the trouble.

27:02.515 --> 27:04.448
Any luck disabling
Roman's device?

27:04.484 --> 27:06.383
I'm trying, I've got
the whole lab working on it,

27:06.419 --> 27:08.084
and we're trying to jam
the signal remotely.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.388
But at least his
tracker's working.

27:10.424 --> 27:11.921
He's on the main floor.
Thank you, Avery.

27:11.957 --> 27:13.657
You guys in yet?

27:13.693 --> 27:15.128
<i>Heading to
the secure room now.</i>

27:46.892 --> 27:48.057
<i>You got eyes?</i>

27:48.093 --> 27:49.660
Nice and clear.

27:52.832 --> 27:53.898
Crawford's
coming up the stairs.

27:53.934 --> 27:56.600
<i>You need to get out of there.</i>

27:56.636 --> 27:57.872
Gonna need a minute.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.441
You've got half that.

28:03.843 --> 28:05.042
- What's the problem?
- I lost the camera.

28:05.078 --> 28:07.544
- Lift the frame.
- Okay, okay.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.580
Here it is.

28:09.616 --> 28:12.552
You got seconds.
Get out of there now.

28:14.654 --> 28:17.220
We're out. Both
cameras in place.

28:22.561 --> 28:25.062
We've got eyes and ears.
Well done.

28:30.669 --> 28:34.604
Jean-Paul, this is
Kira Evans, my attorney.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.974
<i>Nice to see you
come out of retirement.</i>

28:37.010 --> 28:39.709
We're safe to talk here?

28:39.745 --> 28:41.648
There is no place safer.

28:47.253 --> 28:48.785
All right, this is it.

28:48.821 --> 28:50.587
Hang on, we need this
exchange on camera.

28:50.623 --> 28:52.555
<i>So far no one's said or done
anything incriminating.</i>

28:52.591 --> 28:53.893
<i>No one move until I say so.</i>

28:58.532 --> 28:59.763
Pardon the interruption.

28:59.799 --> 29:01.931
He knows we're watching.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.200
Why would he incriminate
himself? That makes no sense.

29:04.236 --> 29:05.773
Unless he's changing
the plan.

29:07.541 --> 29:09.773
What the hell
just happened?

29:09.809 --> 29:12.480
We just got played.

29:16.717 --> 29:18.750
What the hell
just happened?!

29:18.786 --> 29:21.019
<i>Roman just cut off our
feed with the kill switch.</i>

29:21.055 --> 29:22.553
But we did exactly
what he said!

29:22.589 --> 29:24.423
Patterson, any luck
overriding the net?

29:24.459 --> 29:26.524
I'm trying everything I can!

29:26.560 --> 29:28.159
He changed his mind.

29:28.195 --> 29:31.132
Why?

29:41.709 --> 29:45.010
Crawford is the target.

29:45.046 --> 29:47.111
But I need you and the FBI
if we're gonna bring him down.

29:47.147 --> 29:48.847
Everything all right, Tom?

29:48.883 --> 29:51.620
You look like you're going
to a funeral, not a gala.

29:54.188 --> 29:56.521
Just thinking about
the last few months really.

29:56.557 --> 29:58.125
How my life's changed.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.694
It was nice meeting you,
Thomas Jakeman.

30:02.730 --> 30:05.696
I think most people spend their
entire lives trying to be known.

30:05.732 --> 30:09.134
But if you're lucky, you can
find someone who... who sees you.

30:09.170 --> 30:10.836
Come and work for me.

30:10.872 --> 30:13.070
You really took
a chance on me.

30:13.106 --> 30:15.072
Believed in me.

30:15.108 --> 30:16.474
I can't thank you enough.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.877
My dad should
be thanking you.

30:18.913 --> 30:21.946
Admit it, it feels
good to lean on Tom.

30:21.982 --> 30:23.615
You don't look like you have
the weight of the world

30:23.651 --> 30:25.550
on your shoulders
all the time.

30:25.586 --> 30:27.219
You even smile once
in a while now.

30:27.255 --> 30:28.787
Hmm...

30:28.823 --> 30:30.856
Well, look, you got
good instincts, son.

30:30.892 --> 30:33.224
And you can't teach that,
and I trust you.

30:33.260 --> 30:36.627
And there is not many
people I can say that to.

30:36.663 --> 30:38.864
I hope you don't

30:38.900 --> 30:41.265
take this the wrong way,
but I had a conversation

30:41.301 --> 30:44.034
with my personal doctor
about your condition.

30:44.070 --> 30:48.772
The, uh, the headaches,
the fainting spell, the PTSD.

30:48.808 --> 30:51.242
She recommended that
you reduce stress.

30:51.278 --> 30:53.645
Now I know that that sounds
obvious, but she gave me

30:53.681 --> 30:56.248
some techniques a few years
back that really helped me.

30:56.284 --> 30:59.783
My dad used to be even more
intense if you can believe it.

30:59.819 --> 31:01.653
Dr. Farshadi is amazing.

31:01.689 --> 31:03.088
We can go together
if you want.

31:03.124 --> 31:04.822
Yeah, and obviously
just tell us to shut up

31:04.858 --> 31:06.758
if you feel like we're...

31:06.794 --> 31:08.158
if you feel like
we're meddling.

31:08.194 --> 31:11.162
We just want you to stick
around for a while.

31:11.198 --> 31:13.764
'Cause you're family now.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.002
No, you're not meddling.

31:17.038 --> 31:21.606
Uh... I appreciate it
more than you know.

31:21.642 --> 31:23.541
This is Tom Jakeman.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.877
Give me one reason why I
shouldn't arrest you right now.

31:25.913 --> 31:27.177
'Cause you're not here for me.

31:27.213 --> 31:28.914
You nearly compromised
the entire op...

31:28.950 --> 31:30.815
You're gonna tell me to go
sit in the van now, right?

31:30.851 --> 31:32.087
I'll save you the trouble.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.989
Avery? Avery?

31:38.025 --> 31:41.560
Oh, my God!
It's really you.

31:41.596 --> 31:42.993
Hey, thank you
for reaching out.

31:43.029 --> 31:45.163
You know, I... I tried to
contact you after your dad...

31:45.199 --> 31:46.764
I know, I had to get away.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.934
I didn't really talk
to anybody for a while.

31:48.970 --> 31:50.268
Avery, I'm so sorry.

31:50.304 --> 31:52.203
How have you been?

31:52.239 --> 31:54.039
Really good, uh,
graduated business school.

31:54.075 --> 31:55.339
Went back to work for my dad.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.075
You know, I want you
to sit with us at dinner.

31:57.111 --> 31:58.577
Oh, um...

31:58.613 --> 31:59.944
I was actually
just heading out.

31:59.980 --> 32:04.214
I thought I was ready
but seeing everyone, it's...

32:04.250 --> 32:05.951
It's just hard.

32:05.987 --> 32:07.752
Reminds me of everyone
that's not here.

32:07.788 --> 32:09.186
Of course.

32:09.222 --> 32:12.656
Well, uh, please reach out
if you need anything, okay?

32:12.692 --> 32:15.931
- It was so good to see you.
- You too.

32:31.045 --> 32:34.311
Hey... You all right?

32:34.347 --> 32:39.250
Yeah, I just... ran into this
girl I used to know, Avery.

32:39.286 --> 32:41.886
Her dad used to work
for the company, but...

32:41.922 --> 32:43.320
he committed
suicide last year.

32:43.356 --> 32:45.924
And she'd already lost her mom
to cancer, it's, like...

32:45.960 --> 32:48.259
the life's gone out of her,
she's got no one.

32:48.295 --> 32:50.261
Hmm, that's awful.

32:50.297 --> 32:51.896
It made me think of you...

32:51.932 --> 32:55.800
Growing up without a support
system or a safety net.

32:55.836 --> 32:57.368
What that must've been like.

32:57.404 --> 33:00.237
Look, I promise...

33:00.273 --> 33:02.173
you'll never be alone again.

33:02.209 --> 33:03.241
Blake, uh...

33:03.277 --> 33:04.775
The way you've
made me feel safe.

33:04.811 --> 33:07.779
The way you've helped
my father's company...

33:07.815 --> 33:10.348
I'd be lost without you now.

33:10.384 --> 33:12.282
You bring out the best
in people, Tom.

33:12.318 --> 33:15.919
- My dad, me...
- No... no.

33:15.955 --> 33:19.256
You're wrong.
It's not me.

33:19.292 --> 33:20.925
It's you... you...

33:20.961 --> 33:25.030
You are an amazing woman.

33:25.066 --> 33:27.232
All my life, I felt
like people wanted to

33:27.268 --> 33:31.101
be my friend or date me
for all the wrong reasons.

33:31.137 --> 33:33.771
You know, I taught myself
to always be on guard, but...

33:33.807 --> 33:38.046
with you I can be
vulnerable... honest.

33:41.248 --> 33:42.946
I love you so much.

33:42.982 --> 33:45.352
I love you, too, Tom.

33:52.358 --> 33:55.096
I can't imagine
life without you.

33:59.866 --> 34:01.933
Well, you won't have to.

34:01.969 --> 34:03.701
'Cause I'm not
going anywhere.

34:05.338 --> 34:07.337
Oh, we should... we should head
in, dinner's about to start.

34:07.373 --> 34:10.007
Uh, no, we need to find
your dad and Bruyere right now.

34:10.043 --> 34:11.308
But won't that interrupt
their meeting?

34:11.344 --> 34:13.213
Hopefully, I'll
explain on the way.

34:18.119 --> 34:21.418
Pardon the interruption.
Mr. Bruyere?

34:21.454 --> 34:22.420
Monsieur Jakeman?

34:22.456 --> 34:24.723
Sir, a word?

34:27.027 --> 34:29.060
What the
hell just happened?

34:29.096 --> 34:30.295
What are you doing here?

34:30.331 --> 34:31.364
The FBI is onto us.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.132
What the hell are
you talking about?

34:34.168 --> 34:35.333
I don't have time to explain.

34:35.369 --> 34:36.867
You trust me, right?

34:36.902 --> 34:38.172
Dad, listen to Tom.

34:39.507 --> 34:41.172
Of course I do.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.208
I need you to wrap this up
as quickly as possible.

34:43.244 --> 34:45.275
I have a way out.

34:45.311 --> 34:47.045
He changed his mind.

34:47.081 --> 34:49.813
Why?

34:49.849 --> 34:52.085
Does it matter? We just lost
our whole case on Crawford.

34:56.891 --> 34:58.056
<i>Très bon.</i>

34:58.092 --> 34:59.357
The tracker's still active.

34:59.393 --> 35:00.924
We can still get Roman.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.963
All right, let's gear up,
let's move.

35:05.331 --> 35:07.898
Here's the deed
to the land, Hank.

35:07.934 --> 35:09.967
We need to
go right now.

35:10.003 --> 35:13.373
- Jean-Paul... it's a pleasure.
- Hank.

35:15.943 --> 35:18.379
- Jean-Paul...
- Tom.

35:21.447 --> 35:22.916
Follow me.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.223
- They're gone.
- Where's Roman?

35:32.259 --> 35:34.358
<i>Hang on, I'm still
getting some interference.</i>

35:34.394 --> 35:36.895
Okay, here we go, he's downstairs,
headed to the South Atrium...

35:36.931 --> 35:37.895
<i>Uh, sending you
an intercept route now!</i>

35:37.931 --> 35:39.067
Copy.

35:41.302 --> 35:43.204
Okay, he's right
outside the kitchen!

35:44.505 --> 35:46.541
Stay calm.
He's passed the group.

35:49.409 --> 35:50.444
FBI!

35:57.418 --> 35:58.982
Patterson!
Roman's not here!

35:59.018 --> 36:01.252
What? But he's close.

36:01.288 --> 36:02.423
<i>Can you get
across the atrium?</i>

36:05.025 --> 36:06.461
We can't get to him.

36:08.922 --> 36:11.221
We need to get behind them.

36:11.257 --> 36:13.460
All right,
you girls, go, go!

36:46.092 --> 36:48.092
Where the hell
is Roman, Patterson?

36:48.128 --> 36:49.259
I thought you were following
his tracker.

36:49.295 --> 36:51.561
I am, it puts
him right there.

36:51.597 --> 36:54.565
You're literally standing
right on top of him.

36:54.601 --> 36:56.000
Roman found the tracker.

36:56.036 --> 36:58.768
- Jean-Paul...
- Tom.

36:58.804 --> 37:00.637
<i>Let's set up roadblocks.</i>

37:00.673 --> 37:02.239
<i>Keep every ferry from
leaving the island.</i>

37:06.079 --> 37:08.916
That's not gonna stop them,
they're airborne.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.056
We didn't arrest Crawford.

37:19.092 --> 37:21.791
But you just took out one of the
world's deadliest terrorists

37:21.827 --> 37:23.694
before he could
become active again.

37:23.730 --> 37:24.695
Good work.

37:24.731 --> 37:25.933
I'll be in touch.

37:27.134 --> 37:29.166
We were so damn close.

37:29.202 --> 37:32.069
It doesn't add up.

37:32.105 --> 37:34.137
Roman comes up with an elaborate
plan for us to arrest Crawford.

37:34.173 --> 37:35.639
He even gets us
into the room.

37:35.675 --> 37:37.308
Only to make
a complete 180.

37:37.344 --> 37:38.543
Why jam us up
at the last minute?

37:38.579 --> 37:39.777
'Cause that's what he does.

37:39.813 --> 37:41.913
He manipulates us,
wastes our resources...

37:41.949 --> 37:45.181
He's trying to show us
that he's in control again.

37:45.217 --> 37:46.284
I don't think so.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.886
Take a look at this.

37:48.922 --> 37:51.021
I think he realized
what he'd be giving up

37:51.057 --> 37:52.889
if he took Crawford down.

37:52.925 --> 37:54.324
He may have been using Blake,

37:54.360 --> 37:56.960
but I think he actually
cared about her, too.

37:56.996 --> 37:58.962
So what? You're saying
he did it for love?

37:58.998 --> 38:01.866
And family, the two
things he never had.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.735
If he's fully on-side
with Blake and her father,

38:04.771 --> 38:06.103
he's just aligned himself
with one of the most

38:06.139 --> 38:07.704
powerful and dangerous
criminals in the world.

38:07.740 --> 38:08.873
Looks like Roman
won't be helping us

38:08.909 --> 38:11.211
with any more tattoos.

38:15.349 --> 38:17.748
How the hell did
the FBI get onto this?

38:17.784 --> 38:19.750
Maybe they realized Bruyere was a
criminal, and they've been tracking him.

38:19.786 --> 38:21.152
But what are you
talking about?

38:21.188 --> 38:23.587
JP is a criminal?
Dad?!

38:23.623 --> 38:25.021
Blake, you don't need to be
a part of this conversation.

38:25.057 --> 38:27.327
You knew this
and didn't tell me?

38:30.731 --> 38:32.829
Oh, and of course you knew,
everyone but me.

38:32.865 --> 38:34.898
Dad, why would you make a deal
with someone like that?

38:34.934 --> 38:36.333
This could
compromise everything!

38:36.369 --> 38:39.036
The company, our reputation,
our lives!

38:39.072 --> 38:41.943
This land is important.
It had to be done.

38:44.010 --> 38:45.045
I'm getting a drink.

38:50.951 --> 38:53.219
How did you know
the FBI was coming?

38:56.956 --> 38:59.190
Why would I betray you, only to
save you at the last minute?

38:59.226 --> 39:02.192
I don't know.
To secure our trust?

39:02.228 --> 39:05.261
Bruyere is dead now
and you're not.

39:05.297 --> 39:06.933
Because I got us out.

39:14.740 --> 39:16.206
So what do we do now?

39:16.242 --> 39:19.310
We lay low until this
FBI situation is resolved.

39:19.346 --> 39:20.978
I will take
care of the FBI.

39:21.014 --> 39:24.715
You were supposed to take care
of the FBI and you didn't.

39:24.751 --> 39:26.016
We've got Bruyere's land.

39:26.052 --> 39:27.817
We need to set
the plan in motion.

39:27.853 --> 39:29.990
Before anything
else goes wrong.

39:38.164 --> 39:41.098
- Hey...
- Hey.

39:41.134 --> 39:43.199
I've been thinking about
the other night and...

39:43.235 --> 39:46.737
- I shouldn't have left so abruptly.
- Uh...

39:46.773 --> 39:48.773
You don't have
to apologize, I do.

39:48.809 --> 39:52.976
If I could go back
in time... I would.

39:53.012 --> 39:54.177
So, why don't
we just do that?

39:54.213 --> 39:56.947
Let's rewind, pretend
it didn't happen.

39:56.983 --> 39:58.419
We can't, we both know that.

40:00.286 --> 40:02.188
Tasha...

40:04.090 --> 40:07.692
You're my best friend.
I don't wanna lose you.

40:07.728 --> 40:10.261
I can't go to your
wedding, Reade.

40:10.297 --> 40:12.962
I can't be your best man.

40:12.998 --> 40:14.264
Tasha?

40:14.300 --> 40:15.433
I'm sorry.

40:15.469 --> 40:16.967
What am I supposed
to tell Meg?

40:17.003 --> 40:19.869
The truth.

40:19.905 --> 40:21.275
She deserves it.

40:25.211 --> 40:27.244
You think
we'll ever get them?

40:27.280 --> 40:29.717
Yeah, I do.

40:33.052 --> 40:35.985
I need to apologize
for yesterday.

40:36.021 --> 40:37.487
Which part?

40:37.523 --> 40:39.489
You're not gonna make
this easy on me, are you?

40:39.525 --> 40:42.226
Not a chance.

40:42.262 --> 40:45.466
I missed out on
18 years of your life.

40:47.934 --> 40:50.166
And the thought of anything
happening to you again...

40:50.202 --> 40:51.768
I'm okay.

40:51.804 --> 40:53.304
I'll be okay.

40:53.340 --> 40:56.873
I live in a safe house with
two FBI agents guarding my door.

40:56.909 --> 40:59.076
They write up
a report if I sneeze.

41:02.349 --> 41:06.150
All right, so who's ready for me
to try these vegan burgers

41:06.186 --> 41:08.119
you girls have been
raving about? Hmm?

41:08.155 --> 41:12.056
Just don't expect it to taste
like meat and you'll love it.

41:12.092 --> 41:13.389
I want everything
to taste like meat.

41:13.425 --> 41:14.924
Or chocolate.
You wouldn't mind

41:14.960 --> 41:16.494
if everything
tastes like chocolate.

41:16.530 --> 41:18.462
There's a woman
that knows me.

41:18.498 --> 41:19.996
- That's why I love you.
- Hmm.

41:21.867 --> 41:24.304
- I am making a mess over here.
- What is this?

41:29.809 --> 41:31.074
Remi's dead.

41:31.110 --> 41:32.543
I got the chance
to start over,

41:32.579 --> 41:34.949
and I chose
this life away from you.
