WEBVTT

00:01.724 --> 00:05.310
PREVIOUSLY ON "CELEBRITY BIG
BROTHER".

00:05.344 --> 00:11.965
TODRICK CARSON, SHAYNA, TEDDI,
MIRAI AND CYNTHIA ALIGNED AS THE

00:12.000 --> 00:13.034
FORMATION.
YES.

00:13.068 --> 00:15.310
THE ALLIANCE.
HOW ABOUT FORMATION?

00:15.344 --> 00:19.034
OH, MY GOSH.
BUT TODRICK WAS ALSO

00:19.068 --> 00:22.482
RECRUITED FOR THE ATHLETE'S
ALLIANCE WITH HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD

00:22.517 --> 00:24.689
MIESHA, LAMAR AND CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.965
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER AT
FIRST BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GOING

00:27.000 --> 00:29.172
TO HAVE A A TARGET ON OUR BACK,
RIGHT?

00:29.206 --> 00:32.793
GOOD.
AND THE DRAG RACE JUDGE

00:32.827 --> 00:35.793
QUICKLY PLEDGED ULTIMATE LOYALTY
TO THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.655
PERSONALLY LIKE I JUST REALLY
GRAVITATE TO YOU AND I THINK WE

00:38.689 --> 00:41.896
WOULD MAKE AN AWESOME FINAL TWO.
I FEEL SAME WAY.

00:41.931 --> 00:45.758
MIESHA AND I CAN RADIO RIDE
THIS THING UNTIL THE WHEEL FALLS

00:45.793 --> 00:48.793
ON ON THE FINAL TWO.
MAR TRY IS OUT AND MIESHA SET

00:48.827 --> 00:51.758
HER EYE ON A PAWN.
I PLAN TO PUT YOU ON THE

00:51.793 --> 00:53.586
BLOCK BUT YOU THERE PAWN.
OKAY.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.034
SHE THEN BUTT HER PLAN IN
MOTION.

00:56.068 --> 01:01.517
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, MIRAI
AND YOU CARSON.

01:01.551 --> 01:07.034
AT THE FIRST VETO COMPETITION
OF THE WINTER, CARSON BLEW

01:07.068 --> 01:11.965
EVERYONE AWAY.
THREE MINUTES AND 54 SECONDS!

01:12.000 --> 01:18.448
CARSON, YOU HAVE WON THE
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

01:18.482 --> 01:21.310
TODRICK WARNED THAT CARSON
BECAUSE HUGE THREAT.

01:21.344 --> 01:23.413
I DON'T KNOW, THERE IS
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES

01:23.448 --> 01:26.724
ME FEEL LIKE --
HE IS THE PERFECT CANDIDATE

01:26.758 --> 01:28.137
TO WIN THE GAME.
OH, YEAH.

01:28.172 --> 01:33.034
SO MIESHA DECIDED TO STRIKE
AT ONE OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES.

01:33.068 --> 01:36.000
PUTTING TEDDI UP AS MY
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE COULD REALLY

01:36.034 --> 01:39.965
SHAKE UP THINGS IN THIS GAME.
AFTER GETTING MIRAI ON BOARD

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
TO CHANGE ALLEGIANCES.
CAN I TRUST YOU?

01:43.034 --> 01:45.206
ABSOLUTELY.
THEN I THINK THAT YOU COULD

01:45.241 --> 01:47.344
BE A REALLY GOOD ASSET.
OKAY.

01:47.379 --> 01:52.827
MIESHA ALSO GOT SHAYNA TO
AGREE TO BETRAY THE FORMATION.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.896
IT IS A MATTER IF I CAN TRUST
YOU.

01:54.931 --> 01:58.034
IF YOU WANT I WILL EVEN BE
LIKE YOUR PLAN AND FIND OUT

01:58.068 --> 02:01.517
STUFF FOR US.
AT THE VETO MEETING, CARSON

02:01.551 --> 02:04.551
SAVED HIMSELF.
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE

02:04.586 --> 02:09.551
POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.
BUT HE COULDN'T SAVE HIS

02:09.586 --> 02:12.586
FELLOW FORMATION MEMBER.
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO NAME

02:12.620 --> 02:20.000
TEDDI AS MY NEW --
BEFORE THE LIVE EVICTION

02:20.034 --> 02:25.034
JULIE UNLYNCHED MON WON'S CURSE.
BE THE LAST PERSON TO RECEIVE

02:25.068 --> 02:28.034
MON WON'S HAT IS SOMETHING YOU
DON'T WANT.

02:28.068 --> 02:33.793
AND WITH THE FLIP OF THE
LABEL THE NOM HAT GOT PASSED

02:33.827 --> 02:35.241
AROUND.
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT TO

02:35.275 --> 02:38.068
LAMAR.
ALL RIGHT, TODD, YOU ARE NOW

02:38.103 --> 02:39.241
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.
YEP.

02:39.275 --> 02:42.793
AFTER TODD TOOK THE
ICE-SKATER SPOT ON THE HOT SEAT.

02:42.827 --> 02:49.000
I WILL TAKE MARIAH OUT.
THE HOUSE BOOTED THE

02:49.034 --> 02:52.517
HOUSEWIFE.
BIFF A -- BY A VOTE OF 5-3,

02:52.551 --> 02:54.655
TEDDI, YOU ARE THE FIRST
CELEBRITY EVICTED FROM THE BIG

02:54.689 --> 02:58.586
BROTHER HOUSE.
WELL, THE GAME GOES ON, EVEN

02:58.620 --> 03:05.275
THOUGH TEDDI MELLENCAMP IS GONE.
TONIGHT, A NEW HEAD OF

03:05.310 --> 03:10.000
HOUSEHOLD WILL BE CROWNED AND
TWO NEW CELEBRITIES WILL BE

03:10.034 --> 03:15.896
TARGETED FOR EVICTION.
ALL THIS AND MORE ON "CELEBRITY

03:15.931 --> 03:30.827
BIG BROTHER"!
POWER OF>> THANK YOU.

03:30.862 --> 03:34.965
THANK YOU SO MUCH, TODD.
THANK YOU.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
I AM STILL HERE!
TODD BRIDGES, TANK YOU FOR

03:42.034 --> 03:45.862
SAVING ME.
I AM SO EXCITED TO STILL BE HERE

03:45.896 --> 03:50.655
TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY.
IT IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS WINNING

03:50.689 --> 03:59.965
THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT JUST

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
HAPPENED.
A LOT WENT DOWN.

04:04.034 --> 04:11.931
IT WAS VERY CONFUSING AND IN
ESSENCE I HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER

04:11.965 --> 04:14.724
LAMAR OR TODD WAS GOING TO GET
NOMINATED.

04:14.758 --> 04:20.034
AND IT IS NOT ABOUT -- IT IS
NOT JUST ABOUT TODD SNORING.

04:20.068 --> 04:24.413
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUT THOUGHT GIVING IT TO LAMAR

04:24.448 --> 04:28.000
WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE.
ALL RIGHT.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.275
PLEASE, NO CRYING.
I AM CRYING.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.379
WHY?
IT IS NOT A FUNERAL.

04:32.413 --> 04:36.965
SHE IS ALIVE.
MAN, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

04:37.000 --> 04:40.620
TIGHT.
WHAT THE HELL IS CHRISTIE

04:40.655 --> 04:43.793
PUTTING ME ON THE BLOCK?
THAT'S WAY MORE THAN MY BLOOD

04:43.827 --> 04:45.862
PRESSURE CAN HANDLE.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

04:45.896 --> 04:54.310
PAY BACK IS A --
OH, MY GOD.

04:54.344 --> 05:03.310
MAN, THAT MON WON TWIST, OR
THE NO, MA'AM UPON NOM UPON

05:03.344 --> 05:06.793
TWIST REALLY HAD ME WORRIED.
MY PLAN IS EXECUTED NOW

05:06.827 --> 05:09.758
CARSON IS NEXT.
I AM GLAD EVERYBODY WHO IS

05:09.793 --> 05:12.000
HERE IS HERE.
THE ONLY REMAINING MEMBERS OF

05:12.034 --> 05:17.068
OUR ORIGINAL FORMATION ARE ME
AND SHANNA AND CYNTHIA, AND THE

05:17.103 --> 05:24.000
PERSON WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE
DOWN IS CHRIS --, NO, I AM

05:24.034 --> 05:25.620
KIDDING IT IS MIESHA.
I LOVE YOU.

05:25.655 --> 05:31.034
I KNOW THAT.
TELL YOU THAT 15 MILLION MORE

05:31.068 --> 05:35.034
TIMES THIS WEEK.

05:35.068 --> 05:40.517
THAT WAS LIKE THE WORST.
OBVIOUSLY, SOME OF THE PEOPLE

05:40.551 --> 05:45.517
THAT SAID THEY WERE GOING TO
VOTE FOR TEDDI DID NOT, AND IF I

05:45.551 --> 05:47.965
AM IN AN ALLIANCE WITH SOMEONE
WHO SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO DO

05:48.000 --> 05:51.068
SOMETHING AND THEY DON'T THEN I
NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

05:51.103 --> 05:54.206
SO WHO VOTED FOR HER?
ME, YOU AND JAMIE?

05:54.241 --> 05:58.758
YEAH.
BUT NOW IT IS LIKE THE HOUSE

05:58.793 --> 06:02.586
VERSUS ME, YOU AND SHANNA.
SO TEDDED DIFFICULT IS JUST.

06:02.620 --> 06:08.448
TEDDI IS GONE, DIDN'T HAVE
THE VOTES TO STAY SO MAYBE IT

06:08.482 --> 06:13.068
HAS GONE THE WAY OF ABBA.
HAS THE BAND BROKEN UP?

06:13.103 --> 06:17.034
I AM GOING TO DO IT AND IF IT
IS A PAIN IN THE ASS THEN IT IS

06:17.068 --> 06:18.241
A PAIN IN THE ASS.
YEP.

06:18.275 --> 06:21.655
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?
HONESTLY, THAT WAS LIKE THE

06:21.689 --> 06:25.034
WORST THING I HAD TO DO SO --
MY THOUGHT PROCESS WAS THIS,

06:25.068 --> 06:28.724
EVEN IF I VOTED IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A TIE AND THEN MIESHA WOULD

06:28.758 --> 06:31.758
HAVE GOTTEN UP AND -- SO I WENT
WITH THE HOUSE.

06:31.793 --> 06:37.034
REALLY?
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS.

06:37.068 --> 06:41.413
WE WERE KIND OF DOOMED.
AND IT IS WHAT IT IS.

06:41.448 --> 06:46.586
I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS FOR
CYNTHIA AND I BECAUSE WE KEPT

06:46.620 --> 06:51.517
OUR WORD AND VOTED FOR TEDDI, SO
NOW WE ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

06:51.551 --> 06:55.965
THE VOTE AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE
REST OF THE HOUSE WILL BE

06:56.000 --> 07:02.103
AGAINST US.
TRYING OUR BEST IN THIS

07:02.137 --> 07:07.068
COMPETITION, AND WHAT HAPPENS,
HAPPENS.

07:07.103 --> 07:10.586
CYNTHIA IS PISSED AT ME NOW.

07:10.620 --> 07:14.827
I WAS BUT BRUTALLY HONEST WITH
HER, I WAS LIKE WE DIDN'T HAVE

07:14.862 --> 07:16.551
THE NUMBERS.
IT DIDN'T MATTER, IT WOULD HAVE

07:16.586 --> 07:22.034
BEEN A TIE AND THEY EXPECTED YOU
TO VOTE TODD OUT OR TEDDI.

07:22.068 --> 07:24.482
UH-HUH.
SHE IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE YOU

07:24.517 --> 07:26.620
ARE A SNAKE.
I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

07:26.655 --> 07:30.482
CYNTHIA NOW BECAUSE I WENT
AGAINST MY ALLIANCE AND VOTED

07:30.517 --> 07:35.000
OUT TEDDI.
THE LINES HAS BEEN DRAWN AND SHE

07:35.034 --> 07:37.448
IS PISSED.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED

07:37.482 --> 07:39.241
EVEN IF I VOTED YOU WOULD HAVE
VOTED HER OUT.

07:39.275 --> 07:40.862
YEAH.
THE HOUSE HAS THE NUMBERS.

07:40.896 --> 07:44.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
LIKE THROW MYSELF ON THE SHORE,

07:44.034 --> 07:47.655
YOU KNOW, FOR LIKE TWO VOTES?
LIKE IT IS NOT -- IT IS NOT

07:47.689 --> 07:50.551
REMOTELY SMART.
I MEAN YOU REALLY -- YOU WENT

07:50.586 --> 07:54.137
ABOVE AND BEYOND BY VOTING THE
WAY WE WERE VOTING.

07:54.172 --> 07:57.137
I TRUST SHANNA.
RIGHT FROM THE JUMP, SHE

07:57.172 --> 07:59.965
APPROACHED ME AND HE IS SAID, I
WANT TO WORK WITH YOU RIGHT

08:00.000 --> 08:02.482
AWAY.
YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER?

08:02.517 --> 08:03.793
I AM OPEN.
YEAH.

08:03.827 --> 08:06.724
MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH OTHER
PEOPLE, I DON'T CARE.

08:06.758 --> 08:10.689
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO EACH
OTHER.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.379
I WANT TO COME TO YOU AND I
WANT TO BE LIKE A FINAL TWO.

08:13.413 --> 08:17.724
FOR SURE, FOR SURE.
FOR SOME REASON I THINK HER

08:17.758 --> 08:20.344
AND I WERE JUST KIND OF DRAWN
TOGETHER.

08:20.379 --> 08:22.482
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HER
AND I THINK IT WAS THE HONESTY

08:22.517 --> 08:26.172
THAT SHE CAME TO ME THAT I JUST
TRUSTED.

08:26.206 --> 08:32.620
YOU GUYS, IF I AM PUT ON THE
BLOCK BY THEM, HOH.

08:32.655 --> 08:37.206
1,000 PERCENT.
I AM BEHIND YOU, BRO.

08:37.241 --> 08:43.379
I KNOW THAT I AM LIKE ON
PROBATION RIGHT NOW AND IF I WIN

08:43.413 --> 08:47.827
YOU DEFINITELY WILL BE UP THERE.
OKAY.

08:47.862 --> 08:57.379
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD WITH
TODD, WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID

08:57.413 --> 08:59.379
ALLIANCE.
ARE.

08:59.413 --> 09:07.448
I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR AND
THEN I GOT --

09:07.482 --> 09:10.586
LOOK --
IT IS LIKE I DON'T CARE.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.724
YEAH.
I AM TRYING TO DO DAMAGE

09:13.758 --> 09:17.206
CONTROL RIGHT NOW WITH CYNTHIA
BUT THE FACT IS, I MADE A MOVE

09:17.241 --> 09:20.413
THAT WAS BEST FOR MY GAME.
I AM REALLY WORRIED THAT LINES

09:20.448 --> 09:24.379
HAVE BEEN DROUGHT AND THIS HOH
JUST BECAME MORE IMPORTANT THAN

09:24.413 --> 09:28.034
EVER.
THAT'S HOW IT IS GOING TO BE.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.655
YEAH.
PERSONALLY, I LOVE ME SOME

09:32.689 --> 09:35.103
TODD, OKAY?
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS GAME,

09:35.137 --> 09:37.000
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST HIM
ANYMORE.

09:47.793 --> 09:52.551
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

09:52.586 --> 09:53.482
[APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT ALL OF THE GIANT

09:53.517 --> 09:57.517
POTATOES.
SO I WALK OUT INTO THE YARD

09:57.551 --> 10:02.379
AND I SEE ALL OF THESE POTATOES
AND ONE OF THEM IS COVERED IN

10:02.413 --> 10:09.344
MUSHROOMS AND I AM JUST LIKE,
WAIT DARE I -- IS THAT THE CRAZY

10:09.379 --> 10:12.965
SQUIRREL OVER THERE?
YOUR PERFORMANCE IN THIS HEAD

10:13.000 --> 10:16.862
OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION IS
BEING CRITIQUED BY THE POPULAR

10:16.896 --> 10:21.172
CRITICS WEBSITE ROTTEN POTATOES.
BE SURE TO GIVE AN EPIC

10:21.206 --> 10:25.310
PERFORMANCE OR THE CRITICS WILL
LEAVE YOU MASHED.

10:25.344 --> 10:29.068
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.
WHEN THE HORN SOUNDS, GO TO YOUR

10:29.103 --> 10:34.000
FIRST POTATO AND TAKE A SHOT.
IF YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH YOUR

10:34.034 --> 10:39.034
SCORE, HIT THE BUTTON TO LOCK IT
IN AND IT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR

10:39.068 --> 10:41.310
POTATO METER.
IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH

10:41.344 --> 10:44.931
YOUR SCORE, RETRIEVE YOUR BALL
AND TRY AGAIN.

10:44.965 --> 10:49.931
YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO
LOCK IN A SCORE ON ALL THREE

10:49.965 --> 10:52.482
POTATOES.
HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND AT EACH

10:52.517 --> 10:56.827
POTATO IS UP TO YOU.
IN THE END, ALL THREE SCORES

10:56.862 --> 11:00.103
WILL BE ADDED TOGETHER TO
DETERMINE YOUR FINAL TOTAL ON

11:00.137 --> 11:04.620
THE POTATO METER, BUT BE
CAREFUL, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

11:04.655 --> 11:09.827
LOCK IN A SCORE ON ANY POTATO
YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO FOR THAT

11:09.862 --> 11:11.965
SHOT.
THE CELEBRITY WITH THE HIGHEST

11:12.000 --> 11:17.448
SCORE ON THEIR POTATO METER WILL
BECOME THE NEXT HEAD OF

11:17.482 --> 11:20.862
HOUSEHOLD.
WHO IS READY TO PLAY ROTTEN

11:20.896 --> 11:22.103
POTATO?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

11:22.137 --> 11:26.206
MON WON TWIST ALMOST DERAILED
MY PLANS, SO I REALLY NEED

11:26.241 --> 11:30.379
SOMEONE FROM MY ATHLETE'S
ALLIANCE TO STEP UP AND HANDLE

11:30.413 --> 11:32.793
BUSINESS THIS -- BUSINESS THIS
WEEK.

11:32.827 --> 11:37.586
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
HERE, BUT WHAT I I DO KNOW IS

11:37.620 --> 11:41.034
THAT THE ALLIANCE JUST FELL
APART.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.896
CARSON OR I NEED TO DEFINITELY
WIN THIS.

11:43.931 --> 11:46.931
I HAVE BEEN ON THE BLOCK
TODAY FOR TWO MINUTES AND THAT

11:46.965 --> 11:50.586
WAS TWO MINUTES TOO LONG.
I NEED TO WIN THIS HOH

11:50.620 --> 11:54.000
COMPETITION TO MAKE SURE MY
BLOOD GOES NOWHERE NEAR THAT

11:54.034 --> 11:57.689
CHAIR.
AFTER THE EVICTION, I KNOW

11:57.724 --> 12:03.034
THAT THE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN
IN THE SAND AND THIS HOH IS SO

12:03.068 --> 12:05.827
IMPORTANT, I AM ALMOST AFRAID TO
EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING

12:05.862 --> 12:08.620
TO HAPPEN IF CYNTHIA OR CARSON
WIN.

12:08.655 --> 12:11.172
IN FACT, I AM ALMOST SURE THEY
ARE GOING TO NOMINATE ME.

12:11.206 --> 12:17.137
I COULD HAVE HIGHER ON SOME
OF MY FILMS THAT HAVE RECEIVED A

12:17.172 --> 12:21.206
ROTTEN TOMATO BUT THAT IS NOT
GOING TO THROW ME OFF AT ALL IN

12:21.241 --> 12:26.896
THE ROTTEN POTATO EVENT.
MAR TRY YOU ARE FIRST,

12:26.931 --> 12:30.172
EVERYONE ELSE GET BACK INSIDE
AND WAIT YOUR TURN.

12:30.206 --> 12:38.172
I AM GOING TO THE OLYMPICS TO
PLAY WITH ROTTEN POTATOES.

12:38.206 --> 12:42.275
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS COMPETITION
I NEED LOCK IN THE BEST SCORE ON

12:42.310 --> 12:47.931
ALL THREE POTATOES COMBINED.
I WILL -- I ROLL OUT A 14, NOT

12:47.965 --> 12:50.620
GOOD ENOUGH.
I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

12:50.655 --> 12:54.827
THIS POTATO IS TILTED SO YOU
HAVE TO BE VERY STRATEGIC WITH

12:54.862 --> 13:03.206
HOW I THROW IT.
I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES TO DO

13:03.241 --> 13:06.793
IT.
THE ONLY GUARANTEE IN THIS

13:06.827 --> 13:14.206
GAME IS IF YOU ARE HOH, SO OF
COURSE I WANT TO WIN.

13:14.241 --> 13:19.137
NOT ONLY IS THIS POTATO HUGE --
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

13:19.172 --> 13:24.137
IN ORDER TO GET TO WHERE THE
HIGH NUMBERS ARE, I HAVE TO

13:24.172 --> 13:30.310
RICOCHET THE BALL OFF THE WALL.
I LOOK AT THE CLOCK AND I AM

13:30.344 --> 13:43.172
LIKE, GET IT TOGETHER.
I GET A 12, BUT TIME IS A

13:43.206 --> 13:47.172
CLICKING AND I NEED TO GIVE
MYSELF ENOUGH TIME FOR THE LAST

13:47.206 --> 13:50.241
ROTTEN POTATO.
OH, MY GOD.

13:50.275 --> 13:54.551
THE SCORE ON THE LAST ROTTEN
POTATO ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE

13:54.586 --> 13:58.482
FIRST TWO ROTTEN POTATOES, SO I
TRY TO GIVE MYSELF EXTRA TIME

13:58.517 --> 14:04.517
FOR THIS ONE.
BECAUSE I WANT THE HIGH SCORE.

14:04.551 --> 14:10.758
THERE WE GO, MAR TRY.
I GET A 22, I LOOK AT THE

14:10.793 --> 14:12.758
TIME, OKAY I AM GOING TO LEAVE
IT.

14:12.793 --> 14:15.034
IT IS JUST NOT WORTH THE RISK TO
TRY THIS AGAIN.

14:15.068 --> 14:21.241
I AM GOING TO TAKE IT.
MAR TRY WITH A SCORE OF 51,

14:21.275 --> 14:25.827
PLEASE STEP UP TO THE LEADER
PODIUM.

14:25.862 --> 14:29.620
YOU GET A REVIEW THAT IS NOT
VERY APPEALING.

14:29.655 --> 14:34.793
WELL, I LIKE MY POTATOES
FRIED ANYWAYS.

14:34.827 --> 14:39.379
I AM SCARED OF THIS GAME.
WHOO!

14:39.413 --> 14:42.275
TAKE YOUR PLACE AT THE FIRST
POTATO, RODERICK.

14:42.310 --> 14:46.655
I HAVE TO BEAT THE SCORE OF 51 I
NEED TO WIN THIS HOH BECAUSE IF

14:46.689 --> 14:51.310
CARSON WINS HE WILL BE COMING
AFTER ME FOR REVENGE FOR HELPING

14:51.344 --> 14:56.310
TEDDI LEAVE THE GAME.
OH, MY GOD.

14:56.344 --> 15:03.310
NICE!
YES!

15:03.344 --> 15:06.620
I AM REPRESENTING FOR OUR
ALLIANCE.

15:06.655 --> 15:17.413
GOT IT.
TAKE A BREATH.

15:17.448 --> 15:36.896
OH, MY GOD.
WOW.

15:36.931 --> 15:41.241
TODRICK YOUR SCORE OF 36 IS
NOT ENOUGH TO BE MAR TRY'S SCORE

15:41.275 --> 15:42.551
OF 51.
OH, MY GOD.

15:42.586 --> 15:46.413
AS I HIT THE BUZZER MY POTATO
FELL OUT SO MY SCORE I BUZZED IN

15:46.448 --> 15:50.931
ON IS A ZERO.
TODRICK, YOUR REVIEW IS TATER

15:50.965 --> 15:54.965
NOT, PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.
LAMAR, YOU ARE UP NEXT.

15:55.000 --> 16:04.344
51 IS THE SCORE TO BEAT.
HOLD MY POTATO, LET'S DO THIS.

16:04.379 --> 16:08.034
I AM -- I AM A FIERCE
COMPETITOR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

16:08.068 --> 16:11.206
- WHAT I DO, I WANT FAME/
- GAME AND NOTORIETY.

16:11.241 --> 16:17.827
GO LAMAR!
ON THE BASKETBALL COURT I

16:17.862 --> 16:20.379
ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO GO TO THE
HOLE STRONG AND FINISH MY

16:20.413 --> 16:22.137
COMPETITION WITH A NICE FINGER
ROLL.

16:22.172 --> 16:24.413
COME ON, LAMAR, YOU HAVE GOT
THIS.

16:24.448 --> 16:30.310
I PLAN ON USING THE SAME
FINESSE TO KICK BUTT IN THIS

16:30.344 --> 16:37.137
GAME.
COME ON.

16:37.172 --> 16:41.655
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WOW, LAMAR.

16:41.689 --> 16:48.551
LAMAR WITH AER IS OF 61 YOU
ARE STRIKING YUKON GOLD!

16:48.586 --> 16:50.103
[APPLAUSE]
WHOO, WHOO.

16:50.137 --> 16:53.724
LAMAR IS STANDING IN THE
WINNING CIRCLE WITH A POINT

16:53.758 --> 16:56.586
TOTAL OF 61 AND I WANT THIS BAD.
I WAS IN THE SIDELINES LAST WEEK

16:56.620 --> 16:59.448
BUT NOW I AM READY TO START
MAKING SOME MOVES IN THIS HOUSE.

16:59.482 --> 17:03.241
I WOULD LOVE TO WIN THIS HOH SO
I CAN START TAKING CONTROL OF

17:03.275 --> 17:09.379
THIS GAME.
THE SCORE TO BEAT IS FIRST

17:09.413 --> 17:10.896
ONE.
KISS KIRKPATRICK.

17:10.931 --> 17:15.206
MY FIRST FEW ROLLS ON THE
FIRST POTATOES ARE IN THE TEENS

17:15.241 --> 17:19.206
I SO SO I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
ONE IN THE TWENTIES ON EACH OF

17:19.241 --> 17:23.482
THE POTATOES AND THAT IS MY
ULTIMATE GOAL.

17:23.517 --> 17:30.172
COME ON, CHRIS.
YOU HAVE GOT THIS CHRIS, YOU

17:30.206 --> 17:37.724
ARE LOOKING SEXY MAN, YOU HAVE
GOT IT, YOU HAVE GOT IT.

17:37.758 --> 17:40.034
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT
WHAT THE NUMBER IS, SO I KNOW IT

17:40.068 --> 17:45.482
IS HIGH SO I JUST LOG IT IN AND
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

17:45.517 --> 17:49.275
OH -- YES, GOD.
I JUST GOT A 24 WHICH IS A

17:49.310 --> 17:52.310
GOOD NUMBER BUT I STILL HAVE
SOME TIME ON THE CLOCK SO I AM

17:52.344 --> 17:54.655
WILLING TO RISK IT TO GET A
HIGHER NUMBER.

17:54.689 --> 17:58.344
YOU GOT THIS, BIG BOY.
COME ON.

17:58.379 --> 18:03.448
THE BACKSTREET BOYS ARE
WATCHING.

18:03.482 --> 18:12.344
OKAY.
MAN, DID I REALLY JUST LOSE A

18:12.379 --> 18:15.137
BASEBALL -- A BALLGAME TO A POP
STAR?

18:15.172 --> 18:18.344
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK COMING IN
HOT WITH 75.

18:18.379 --> 18:20.586
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU POP
BACK.

18:20.620 --> 18:21.793
THAT WAS SPUD-TACULAR

18:27.482 --> 18:29.034
SHANNA YOUARE UP NEXT, THE

18:29.068 --> 18:33.827
SCORE CAN TO BEAT IS 75.
I SEE CHRIS ON THE PODIUM SO

18:33.862 --> 18:36.551
I FEEL REALLY SECURE BUT AT THE
SAME TIME I AM SUPER COMPETITIVE

18:36.586 --> 18:43.034
SO I WANT TO WIN THIS.

18:43.068 --> 18:47.034
I AM A BIT OF A POOL SHARK,
SO I AM THINKING TO MYSELF, HEY,

18:47.068 --> 18:49.896
THIS MIGHT JUST BE LIKE POOL.
DO YOUR THING, GIRL.

18:49.931 --> 18:53.482
OH!
THERE IS NOT LIKE POOL AT

18:53.517 --> 18:57.862
ALL.
I PANICKED.

18:57.896 --> 19:02.758
LOCK IT!
OKAY, SHANNA.

19:02.793 --> 19:11.206
ROUND 2, LET'S GO.
GOOD JOB, MAMA.

19:11.241 --> 19:14.344
I RAN INTO A POTATO.
LOCK IT, LOCK IT.

19:14.379 --> 19:21.931
YOU ARE DONE!
LIKE NO ONE ELSE RAN INTO A

19:21.965 --> 19:24.620
POTATO.
OH, MY GOD.

19:24.655 --> 19:30.586
I AM NOT A PHYSICAL THREAT.

19:30.620 --> 19:35.068
SORRY, SAN NA, THAT SCORE OF
52 IS NOT ENOUGH TO BEAT CHRIS

19:35.103 --> 19:41.689
KIRKPATRICK'S SCORE OF 75.
CARSON!

19:41.724 --> 19:49.793
HERE SHE IS.
IF I GET A POTATO DON'T HATE

19:49.827 --> 19:51.275
ME.
CHRIS'S SCORE IS REALLY GOOD

19:51.310 --> 19:55.034
BUT CARSON HAS SHOCKED ME BEFORE
IN COMPETITION SO I AM REALLY

19:55.068 --> 19:57.896
NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.
OH, GOLL, IT IS SO HEAVY.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.862
CARSON, YOU HAVE GOT TO BEAT
75 TO TAKE THE LEAD.

20:00.896 --> 20:04.413
OH, I DON'T WANT THAT.
I FEEL LIKE I AM IN A BIT OF

20:04.448 --> 20:08.241
A PRECARIOUS POSITION.
OUR ALLIANCE HAS DWINDLED DOWN

20:08.275 --> 20:10.965
SUCH A SMALL GROUP.
I AM GOING TO GO WITH THAT.

20:11.000 --> 20:21.310
SO I KIND OF THINK I SHOULD
WIN THIS.

20:21.344 --> 20:25.310
13.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.

20:25.344 --> 20:30.344
THERE YOU GO.
I AM SWEATING BULLETS RIGHT

20:30.379 --> 20:33.862
NOW, CARSON NEEDS 40 POINTS
WHICH IS REALLY JUST ONE GOOD

20:33.896 --> 20:37.689
ROLL.
SO LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

20:37.724 --> 20:39.517
WHOO!
OH, NO.

20:39.551 --> 20:47.000
COME ON, CARSON.
OH, GOSH.

20:47.034 --> 20:51.034
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
[BUZZER]

20:51.068 --> 20:54.758
CARSON, YOU FAILED TO LOCK IN
A SCORE ON YOUR FINAL POTATO.

20:54.793 --> 21:01.724
OH, NO.
THE REVIEWERS SAID STARK

21:01.758 --> 21:04.655
RAVING MAD BUT ENJOY THE MOVIE.
I DISAGREE.

21:04.689 --> 21:08.137
CARSON DOES NOT SEEM TO BE
STANDING IN THE QUINNER'S

21:08.172 --> 21:11.034
CIRCLE.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS ALL ON ME.

21:11.068 --> 21:13.862
SMALL POTATOES.
ALL RIGHT, CYNTHIA, THE SCORE TO

21:13.896 --> 21:15.689
BEAT IS 75.
[BUZZER]

21:15.724 --> 21:18.793
COME ON, CYNTHIA.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.

21:18.827 --> 21:21.172
OH, MY GOSH!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS

21:21.206 --> 21:27.689
HAPPENING HERE, BUT WHAT I DO
KNOW IS THAT OUR ALLIANCE JUST

21:27.724 --> 21:32.586
FELL APART.
I NEED TO DEFINITELY WIN THIS.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.758
THAT ONE LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
GREAT.

21:35.793 --> 21:50.034
TAKE YOUR TIME.
[BUZZER]

21:50.068 --> 21:53.862
YOUR SCORE OF 36 IS NOT
ENOUGH TO BEAT CHRIS

21:53.896 --> 21:57.827
KIRKPATRICK.
THE CRITICS SAY THAT PERFORMANCE

21:57.862 --> 22:03.206
SHOULD BE FRIED.
WASHINGTON, WAH, WAH.

22:03.241 --> 22:05.827
COME ON, TODD.
DON'T BEAT ME, PLEASE.

22:05.862 --> 22:09.793
I GO OUT THERE ALL JAZZED UP
AND TRYING TO WIN AND I SEE

22:09.827 --> 22:12.034
CHRIS IN THE WINNER'S CIRCLE
RIGHT NOW. I HAVE A FRIEND

22:12.068 --> 22:13.413
THERE.
I DON'T HAVE TO WIN THIS.

22:13.448 --> 22:20.103
TODD, YOU HAVE TO BEAT 75 TO
TAKE THE LEAD.

22:20.137 --> 22:23.448
[BUZZER]
OH.

22:23.482 --> 22:25.655
NO, DON'T LOCK IN THE SIX.

22:25.689 --> 22:29.103
YOU NEED LIKE 6300 MORE
POINTS TO WIN THIS.

22:29.137 --> 22:35.034
KEEP GOING.
JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO

22:35.068 --> 22:45.137
WIN THE GAME DOESN'T MEAN I
CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK CONVINCING.

22:45.172 --> 22:51.413
LET'S TRY TO THROW THIS.
MAN, I LOVE POTATOES.

22:51.448 --> 22:57.103
TATER TOTS, FRENCH FRIES, CURLY
FRIES.

22:57.137 --> 23:03.482
CRISPY FRIES, MASHED POTATOES.
THERE IS POTATOES WITH GARLIC.

23:03.517 --> 23:06.724
GEEZ.
I KNOW SO MANY WAYS TO MAKE

23:06.758 --> 23:13.827
POTATOES I WAS UPSET WHEN I SEE
POTATOES GETTING WASTED.

23:13.862 --> 23:16.482
YOUR SCORE OF 33 IS NOT

23:16.517 --> 23:23.655
ENOUGH TO TAKE THE LEAD.
THE CRITICS SAY, OOPH.

23:23.689 --> 23:29.034
OUCH POTATO.
THE POTATO BURNED ME!

23:29.068 --> 23:33.793
THANK YOU.
STRANGER THINGS HAVE

23:33.827 --> 23:37.448
HAPPENED, IF CHRIS KATTAN WINS
THIS ALL BETS ARE OFF BECAUSE I

23:37.482 --> 23:40.034
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT HE
WOULD DO.

23:40.068 --> 23:43.689
KATTAN, YOU CAN.
YES, YOU KATTAN.

23:43.724 --> 23:49.034
WHO THUNK WE WOULD OUR HOPES
AND DREAMS ON CHRIS KATTAN.

23:49.068 --> 23:52.965
YOU HAVE TO BEAT 75 IN ORDER
TO BE THE WINNER OF THE HOH

23:53.000 --> 23:57.827
COMPETITION, CHRIS KATTAN.
COME ON, CHRIS.

23:57.862 --> 24:01.931
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT.

24:01.965 --> 24:05.896
NO.
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE

24:05.931 --> 24:11.793
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.
IT IS SOMETHING TO LOOK UP TO.

24:11.827 --> 24:15.896
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
YOU GET A LOT OF RESPECT AND

24:15.931 --> 24:24.896
YOU GET POWER.
MY STRATEGY FOR THROWING THE

24:24.931 --> 24:29.034
POTATO IS A BIT OF A TACK, A TAP
ON THE BUTT.

24:29.068 --> 24:39.482
ONE LITTLE TAP.
YOU HAVE LOTS OF TIME.

24:39.517 --> 24:45.689
COME ON, CHRIS.
SO I NEED A 48 TO TIE WITH

24:45.724 --> 24:49.862
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, LET'S GO 48.
COME ON, 48.

24:49.896 --> 24:54.931
YOU HAVE TO HIT THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, CHRIS.

24:54.965 --> 25:04.827
OH, MY GOSH!

25:04.862 --> 25:11.896
CHRIS, YOU FAILED TO LOCK IN
A SCORE ON YOUR THIRD POTATO,

25:11.931 --> 25:21.655
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WITH A SCORE
OF 75, YOU ARE THE NEW HOH!

25:21.689 --> 25:26.344
♪
YEAH, BABY! HOH!

25:26.379 --> 25:29.896
THIS IS BUCKET LIST FOR ME.
I CAN DIE 0 A HAPPY MAN.

25:29.931 --> 25:33.793
LIKE WHEN I CAME ON TO BIG
BROTHER, THIS KEY WAS MY LIFE,

25:33.827 --> 25:37.000
AND NOW IT IS MINE.
I GET TO SEE A PICTURE.

25:37.034 --> 25:40.413
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WINNING THIS,

25:40.448 --> 25:44.620
IT COULDN'T BE MORE PERFECT.
THE ATHLETES ALLIANCE MAINTAINS

25:44.655 --> 25:48.620
CONTROL AND WE ARE GOING TO JUST
PICK UP MOMENTUM GOING INTO THIS

25:48.655 --> 25:50.620
NEXT WEEK.
POTATO --

25:50.655 --> 25:53.931
I AM SO EXCITED FOR CHRIS TO
HAVE A BIG WIN LIKE THAT BECAUSE

25:53.965 --> 25:58.137
HE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON.
HOWEVER, HE IS BASICALLY JOINED

25:58.172 --> 26:03.896
AT THE HIP WITH MIESHA, SO THAT
COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.

26:03.931 --> 26:07.793
I BETTER START BUTTERING HIS
POTATO RIGHT NOW!

26:19.310 --> 26:21.344
GOOD JOB, CHRIS!

26:21.379 --> 26:24.344
75, BIG DOG!
ALL RIGHT.

26:24.379 --> 26:27.931
I WAS WITH MIESHA WHEN SHE WAS
IN POWER BUT NOW I HAVE THE

26:27.965 --> 26:30.034
POWER.
I NEED TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR MY

26:30.068 --> 26:35.689
GAME AND HOW I USE MY POWER
MIGHT NOT MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

26:35.724 --> 26:40.931
I THINK I WILL HAVE A POTATO.
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK HAS JUST

26:40.965 --> 26:44.758
WON HOH.
HE LIKES ME AND I LIKE HIM,

26:44.793 --> 26:48.275
HOWEVER, I AM PRETTY SURE HE IS
WORKING WITH MIESHA AND IF

26:48.310 --> 26:58.862
THAT'S THE CASE, HE COULD BE
SINGING BYE TO LITTLE OLD ME.

26:58.896 --> 27:03.724
I AM SO EXCITED, CHRIS, JUST
WON, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

27:03.758 --> 27:09.000
TOGETHER AND I KNOW HE IS GOING
TO KEEP ME SAFE.

27:09.034 --> 27:13.275
CHRIS WINNING HOH IS PERFECT,
BECAUSE HE IS IN MY ALLIANCE, SO

27:13.310 --> 27:18.551
I AM GOING TO BE SAFE AND MYSELF
AND TODRICK WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY

27:18.586 --> 27:23.137
IN THE NEXT HOH.
AND I LIKE TO THINK I HAVE

27:23.172 --> 27:27.724
SOME INFLUENCE OVER CHRIS AND
HOPEFULLY I WILL HAVE AN EAR

27:27.758 --> 27:33.724
THIS WEEK ON WHO TO PUT UP ON
THE BLOCK.

27:33.758 --> 27:43.172
THANKS.
SO GIVE IT SOME TIME.

27:43.206 --> 27:46.586
I GOT YOU DOWN LOW.
THE I KNOW.

27:46.620 --> 27:50.517
EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT CHRIS

27:50.551 --> 27:56.517
KIRKPATRICK WINNING HOH?
I MEAN, HE IS COOL.

27:56.551 --> 27:57.689
DAMN!
WHAT?

27:57.724 --> 28:05.413
YOU BETTER GET -- YO, WHAT'S
UP WITH YOU.

28:05.448 --> 28:09.758
MY LEG, THAT'S A -- LEG.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:09.793 --> 28:12.551
THEY ARE NICE AND SLIM.
THEY ARE SLIM.

28:12.586 --> 28:21.241
HOW ARE YOUR LEGS HOLDING UP
YOUR BODY, OH, MAN.

28:21.275 --> 28:27.000
ARE THESE ANYBODY'S IN

28:27.034 --> 28:30.551
PARTICULAR?
OR CAN WE JUST -- HOW ARE YOU

28:30.586 --> 28:31.517
FEELING?
GOOD.

28:31.551 --> 28:34.551
SO REAL QUICK, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS THINKING?

28:34.586 --> 28:39.724
TO ME, I WANT MAR TRY OUT.
SO I AM BASICALLY GOOD WITH

28:39.758 --> 28:42.241
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.
I HAVE GOT SHANNA, I AM GOOD

28:42.275 --> 28:46.448
WITH MIESHA AND TODRICK, AND I
AM ALSO FRIENDLY WITH CARSON AND

28:46.482 --> 28:51.275
MS. SIN, I CAN'T THE ONLY PERSON
I AM NOT TIGHT WITH IS MAR TRY.

28:51.310 --> 28:55.206
AND THE FACT SHE CAN WIN COMPS
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

28:55.241 --> 29:02.241
GAME IMPROVES --
I THINK IT IS AN OPTION.

29:02.275 --> 29:05.931
WHEN CHRIS MENTIONED MAR TRY

29:05.965 --> 29:08.827
AS A TARGET, I WAS LIKE, NO, NOT
MAR TRY.

29:08.862 --> 29:11.896
I JUST WORKED SO HARD TO SAVE
HER.

29:11.931 --> 29:14.551
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
I MADE A DEAL WITH MAR TRY FOR

29:14.586 --> 29:16.862
THE TEAM.
WE CAN'T CASH IN ON THAT DEAL IF

29:16.896 --> 29:20.517
SHE IS GONE, BUT I AM NOT GOING
TO JUMP DOWN HIS THROAT JUST

29:20.551 --> 29:22.551
YET.
IN MY MIND, THERE IS JUST ONE

29:22.586 --> 29:30.344
TARGET AND THAT'S CARSON.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

29:30.379 --> 29:34.482
PUTTING CARSON AND MAR TRY ON
THE BLOCK -- ON THE BLOCK.

29:34.517 --> 29:38.551
AND IF ONE OF THEM GETS OUT
AND --

29:38.586 --> 29:44.068
CYNTHIA.
KEEP THE TEAM SAFE, USE THE

29:44.103 --> 29:49.689
POWER WHILE YOU HAVE IT.
WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT WITH

29:49.724 --> 29:51.068
TODD.
MIESHA STARTS TELLING ME WHAT

29:51.103 --> 29:57.724
SHE WANTS FOR HER GAME, AND I AM
THINKING IN MY HEAD, THIS IS MY

29:57.758 --> 30:07.068
HOH.

30:07.103 --> 30:12.931

I CAN'T GIVE MY WORD, I DON'T

31:27.724 --> 31:32.379
WANT TO LIKE -- BUT RIGHT NOW I
AM NOT GUNNING FOR ANYBODY.

31:32.413 --> 31:36.551
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I AM NOT
LISTENING TO ANYBODY ELSE

31:36.586 --> 31:42.620
TELLING ME HOW TO PLAY MY GAME.
SO. THERE IS A DIVIDE IN THE

31:42.655 --> 31:45.000
HOUSE.
YOU HAVE MIESHA AND TODRICK ON

31:45.034 --> 31:48.482
ONE SIDE AND CARSON AND CYNTHIA
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

31:48.517 --> 31:52.620
IF I CAN LEAVE THEM BOTH IN
THERE AND I WILL JUST LET THEM

31:52.655 --> 31:54.965
BATTLE IT OUT AND SIT BACK AND
LOOK PRETTY ALL THE WAY TO THE

31:55.000 --> 31:56.517
END.
YOU GUYS ARE BEST FOR MY GAME

31:56.551 --> 31:58.137

CHRIS IS TELLING ME I AM NOT
HIS TARGET IS VERY GOOD NEWS,

32:09.586 --> 32:13.241

OF RELIEF.

32:13.275 --> 32:17.482

BATHTUB WHILE I AM ON HIS GOOD

32:17.517 --> 32:19.241

32:36.655 --> 32:38.620
GRANDMOTHER HOUSE.
I HOPE IT IS GOING TO BE

32:38.655 --> 32:40.896

DURING THE PANDEMIC I LEARNED

32:40.931 --> 32:46.137

32:52.689 --> 32:58.275
CAKE?
I MIGHT.

32:58.310 --> 33:13.275
CHRIS KATTAN HAS BEEN

33:52.862 --> 33:55.586
DOUBLE-DIPPING IN THAT CAKE FOR
DAYS.

33:55.620 --> 34:01.551
SO IT HAS BEEN CON TAP MADE,
CONTAMINATED, IT HAS BEEN

34:01.586 --> 34:14.344

HOW ARE YOU DOING?

34:17.965 --> 34:24.793

34:24.827 --> 34:32.034
I SUPPOSED, I THOUGHT THAT
CAKE WAS GOING TO BE FOR

34:32.068 --> 34:37.517
EVERYBODY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT
IS JUST FOR CHRIS KATTAN.

34:37.551 --> 34:41.241
CARSON'S CAKE, I HAVEN'T
TRIED THAT BEFORE, I HAVE NO

34:41.275 --> 34:46.310

HE TAKES THE CAKE, HE TAKES

34:46.344 --> 34:53.379
CAKE.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

34:53.413 --> 34:55.482
LET'S TALK.
I HAVE TO NOMINATE TODAY.

34:55.517 --> 34:57.448
OH, DAMN.

34:57.482 --> 35:05.310
SO I WANT TO PUT MAR TRY ON
THE BLOCK, MAR TRY ON THE MIRAI

35:05.344 --> 35:09.896
ON THE BLOCK.
SO WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF I

35:09.931 --> 35:16.793
PUT UP MIRAI?
.. NOW WHO DO I PUT UP

35:16.827 --> 35:19.068
AGAINST HER?
I DON'T KNOW.

35:19.103 --> 35:22.068
WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY?
BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE

35:22.103 --> 35:23.965
COMPETITION IS TO TAKE OUT THE
COMPETITION, RIGHT?

35:24.000 --> 35:31.275
DO I PUT YOU UP?
I AM PROBABLY GOOD IN THE

35:31.310 --> 35:33.034
COMPETITION.
BUT IF I PUT YOU THEREUPON IS

35:33.068 --> 35:37.206
A CHANCE YOU COULD GO HOME.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT ANYBODY UP.

35:37.241 --> 35:39.137
YEAH.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU UP, I

35:39.172 --> 35:43.413
DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU UP.
MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE BEEN A

35:43.448 --> 35:46.517
TEAM PLAYER AND I HAVE BEEN
ASKED TO COME OFF THE BENCH, BUT

35:46.551 --> 35:49.034
TO HELP THE TEAM OUT, I WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

35:49.068 --> 35:53.000
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TELL
ME WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

35:53.034 --> 35:55.034
TELL ME WHO TO VOTE AND I
WILL VOTE.

35:55.068 --> 35:59.551
I DIDN'T REALIZE TODD LAMAR
WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME

35:59.586 --> 36:03.103
THIS MUCH, IF HE IS WILLING TO
BE THAT LOYAL MAYBE IT IS EASIER

36:03.137 --> 36:05.448
TO USE HIM AS A VOTE THAN A
NOMINEE.

36:05.482 --> 36:13.551
SINCE YOU THE LEADER I WILL
VOTE WHOEVER YOU WANT ME TO.

36:13.586 --> 36:22.896
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS RIGHT

36:22.931 --> 36:25.551
NOW?
I AM GOING TO THINK ABOUT IT.

36:25.586 --> 36:30.206
YEAH.
IN THE BACK DOOR I, BACK DOOR

36:30.241 --> 36:31.586
I WANT TO GIVE HER A CHANCE TO,
YOU KNOW,.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.103
YEAH, YEAH.
FIGHT.

36:33.137 --> 36:35.586
YEAH.
DO YOU THINK SHE IS A BIGGER

36:35.620 --> 36:38.310
TARGET RIGHT NOW THAN CARSON?
FOR ME.

36:38.344 --> 36:40.448
FOR YOU?
OKAY.

36:40.482 --> 36:41.689
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
OKAY.

36:41.724 --> 36:48.931
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS, THEN.
IF YOU PUT UP MIRAI AND MIRAI

36:48.965 --> 36:54.965
WINS VETO OR GETS SOMEONE TO WIN
VETO AND TAKE HER DOWN, WHO

36:55.000 --> 36:57.275
WOULD YOU PUT IN HER PLACE
IDEALLY?

36:57.310 --> 36:59.448
I DON'T KNOW.
I WOULD ARGUE CARSON.

36:59.482 --> 37:03.000
DOOR SON?
I REALLY THINK HE IS THE MOST

37:03.034 --> 37:05.965
UNDERLYING THREAT IN THE FIELD.
WELL, BUT I MEAN, HE IS NOT

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
REALLY A THREAT TO ME YET, YOU
KNOW. I MEAN HE IS AS MUCH OF A

37:10.034 --> 37:14.689
THREAT AS YOU ARE TO ME, BUT --
THAT IS GAME GOES ON IT

37:14.724 --> 37:16.965
BECOMES MORE ABOUT MENTAL
STATION THAT'S WHERE HE IS A

37:17.000 --> 37:19.310
THREAT, NOT IN THE PHYSICAL.
CHRIS IS STILL RIDING THE

37:19.344 --> 37:22.344
HIGH OF WINNING THE HOH
COMPETITION, BUT IT IS TIME TO

37:22.379 --> 37:25.620
SOBER UP AND START SEEING
CLEARLY, BECAUSE CARSON IS THE

37:25.655 --> 37:29.724
BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS HOUSE.
UNFORTUNATELY, CHRIS AND I ARE

37:29.758 --> 37:32.793
NOT IN THE OCTAGON OR JUST PUT
HIM IN THE HEADLOCK.

37:32.827 --> 37:35.896
I JUST WANT TO SPELL IT OUT FOR
HIM BUT HE IS NOT PICKING UP

37:35.931 --> 37:40.517
WHAT I AM PUTTING DOWN.
IF WORST-CASE SCENARIO MIRAI

37:40.551 --> 37:43.482
CAN PUT HERSELF OFF THE BLOCK --
YEAH.

37:43.517 --> 37:46.310
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD VOTE THEM OUT RIGHT

37:46.344 --> 37:50.275
THEN AND TAKE OUT THE HEAD OF
THAT SIDE.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.655
WE DIS, DISASSEMBLED ONE PERSON
OF HIS TEAM.

37:52.689 --> 37:57.413
BUT THERE IS REALLY NOBODY
OVER THERE, YOU KNOW, IT IS JUST

37:57.448 --> 38:00.310
HIM AND CYNTHIA NOW.
YEAH.

38:00.344 --> 38:02.724
I DON'T THINK THERE REALLY

38:02.758 --> 38:08.620
IS, I DON'T THINK THIRD REALLY
THAT MUCH OF A THREAT.

38:08.655 --> 38:12.586
WHAT I WOULD ASK IF YOU CAN'T
TAKE YOUR NUMBER ONE TARGET OUT,

38:12.620 --> 38:16.586
THEN LET'S TAKE OUT THE TEAM'S
NUMBER ONE TARGET AND THAT'S

38:16.620 --> 38:17.310
CARSON.

38:40.965 --> 38:43.172
HEY, EVERYBODY, IT IS TIME
FOR THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.482
THIS IS THE NOMINATION

39:06.517 --> 39:10.551

THIS IS A VERY DISCOURAGING
FEELING.

41:09.310 --> 41:15.068

CHRIS SAID HE MIGHT PUT ME ON
THE BLOCK BUT HE DIDN'T.

SO THAT'S COOL.
I HAVE GIVEN CHRIS 101

41:30.896 --> 41:34.413
