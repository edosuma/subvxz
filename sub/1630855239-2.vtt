GEORGE:
I told the paramedics this was

06:20.713 --> 06:22.632
not a normal heart attack, but
they didn't take me seriously.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.759
And look, Nancy,
I'm wearing a blazer.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.011
I am not a doctor,
but veins don't just

06:27.053 --> 06:28.679
turn black like that.
I'm not saying

06:28.721 --> 06:31.182
it was supernatural,
but maybe supernatural-adjacent?

-NANCY: I'll get some
pictures for evidence.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.027
So, why did Abbott suddenly
want to destroy that file?

06:43.069 --> 06:46.114
And why did he tell you
not to go to Magpie Lake?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.366
I have no idea
what Magpie Lake is.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.992

06:52.829 --> 06:55.039

if he received any threats.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.542
But I can't find anything.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.628
Well, what caused his sudden
change of behavior, his panic?

07:03.464 --> 07:06.092
When you left Abbott,
he was drinking water?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.344
Yeah. I filled up his cup

07:08.386 --> 07:10.430
with the pitcher
from the fridge.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.682
-Could he have been poisoned?
-Can I see it?

poisoned water

didn't just get into your mouth.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.110

07:24.152 --> 07:26.070
-She seems okay.
-Yeah,

07:26.112 --> 07:28.156

07:28.197 --> 07:31.200

just in case.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.376

07:40.418 --> 07:42.128
Nope.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.132

07:46.174 --> 07:49.218

what's going on with us.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.846

even screening for?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.231

10:05.771 --> 10:07.440
breaking into
his classmate's house.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.109
The classmate was a minor
so their name was redacted.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.695
Abbott dismissed the charges
on insufficient evidence.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.363
-Nothing too damaging in there.
-GEORGE: Wait, and there was

10:14.405 --> 10:16.991
-no mention of the lake?
-ACE: Nick and I have been doing

10:17.033 --> 10:18.409
an extensive search.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.078
Closest Magpie Lake--
3,000 miles away.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.496
NANCY:
Let me see that.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.831
Hey, we should
talk to Logan Rhodes.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.416
He lives in Eastville.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.959
Wait, if Logan is in Eastville,
that's only

10:27.001 --> 10:29.086
-ten minutes away from here.
-NANCY: Right.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.339
We should talk to Logan.
Good thinking, George.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.716
Thanks, that was my thinking.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.718
-But...
-You know, you should smile.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.095
Guys are easily 25% hotter
with teeth visible.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.805
You're all hearing this, right?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.891
Yeah, something
is definitely wrong.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.852
Yeah, it's like she's
mentally turned into a dude.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.854
And now she's Nan-spreading.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.273
Yeah, but do all dudes
act like that?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.442
Nick and I don't
act like that, right?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.569
Oh, you're not
capable of achieving

10:53.611 --> 10:57.031
this level of awesome. It's not
your fault. It's biology.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.616
BESS:
Right, yeah, I know this guy.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.368
She's acting like
a straight cis-female

11:00.409 --> 11:02.662
gender-swapped version
of a bro-y guy.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.123
Oh, completely clear, thanks.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.458
ACE:
This must've all started when

11:07.500 --> 11:09.627
she got splashed
with Abbott's water.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.629
Must have done
something to Nancy.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.964
I'm fine. Chill.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.885
I'll get that.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.638
Okay.
So, what was in that water--

11:20.680 --> 11:23.265
some mystical
bro-licious poison?

11:23.307 --> 11:26.435
Can one poison give Abbott
a heart attack and also

11:26.477 --> 11:28.979
turn Nancy into the type of guy
that I will never date?

11:29.021 --> 11:31.107
If the poison affected
Abbott's behavior,

11:31.148 --> 11:34.026
maybe it sent him into distress,
causing the heart attack.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.737
I'll, uh, look it up and see
if I can find an antidote.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.864
All while perfectly
searing this salmon.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.741
At least Bro-Nancy
is, you know, harmless

11:40.783 --> 11:42.451
and somewhat entertaining.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.745
Yeah, we're all amused.
We need to figure out

11:44.787 --> 11:47.915
who poisoned Judge Abbott.
Solve Abbott, solve Bro-Nancy.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.459
Well, I loosened it for you.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.628
You and me--
we're going to Logan's house.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.839
Great. George and I'll check
on Abbott, see if he's talking.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.967
NANCY:
And, hey, Bess, you're gonna
cook the hell out of this meal.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.137
-You got this.
-Mm.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.391
Hey.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.728
You got the EMTs there quickly.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.105
He's lucky you were with him.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.149
Yeah, I just...

12:13.190 --> 12:15.067
I just want him to be okay.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.319
You know, I know
Judge Abbott was hard on me--

12:17.361 --> 12:19.822
probably on everyone--
but he really cares.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.741
I mean, I don't... I...

12:21.782 --> 12:24.368
He gave me a clerkship
and I'm not even in law school.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.704
This whole lawyer dream
feels doable because of him.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.373
I never got to tell him how much
I appreciate everything.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.293
You will.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.257
Okay, talk to me
about something else.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.593
How was your date with Jade?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.345
Oh, no, we don't need to...

12:43.387 --> 12:44.722
Did you spark with her?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.307
Their pronouns are they/them.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.809
I-I don't even know
if it counts as a date.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.311
It felt like...

12:50.352 --> 12:51.812
PR coaching.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.940
Mm-hmm.
Were you disappointed?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.817
Disappointed I lost my hat.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.277
I left it at the café.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.529
Not sure I'd call that a loss.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.783
I'm sorry, Judge Abbott
was just admitted to surgery.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.284
He can't see you now,
but here's the number

13:05.326 --> 13:07.411
for the nurse's station.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.501
-NANCY: Logan Rhodes.
-ACE: Do you drink

13:13.542 --> 13:16.796
-all that in one day?
-Three times.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.297
Yeah, the motivational
markers help.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.508
I got a whole selection
of 'em in my gym.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.884
You lift?

13:21.926 --> 13:22.843
-I can get you a guest pass.
-Okay,

13:22.885 --> 13:24.553
back to Judge Abbott.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.847
We think someone
caused his heart attack.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.307
Think someone came after him.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.392
-Oh, that's awful.
-Before Abbott lost

13:30.434 --> 13:32.311
consciousness, he tried
to rip up a file containing

13:32.353 --> 13:34.063
a summary of your trial.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.731
Wait, you don't think
I did it.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.192
That was over 20 years ago.
And it was nothing.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.528
I broke into a house on a dare.
Judge Abbott

13:40.569 --> 13:42.613
knew I came from
a hardworking family,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.616
he could tell I was a good kid,
and he dismissed the charges.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.077
I was so grateful I even
brought him a thank-you gift.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.829
Okay, we get it.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.372
You're, like,
in love with Abbott.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.414
But judges aren't allowed
to accept gifts.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.708
Well, it wasn't expensive.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.085
And you never
crossed paths again?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.795
Not even at Magpie Lake?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.714
Uh, Magpie Lake isn't a lake.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.676
She's a girl. The one
whose house I broke into.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.427
Margaret Pyne Lake.
She went by Maggie,

14:05.469 --> 14:08.722
so we called her Magpie.
Magpie Lake.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.059
Margaret Pyne...

14:12.101 --> 14:13.602
is this the same
Margaret Pyne Lake

14:13.644 --> 14:16.021
who, um, fell
and almost died in '96?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.190
Uh, yeah. A few weeks
after my trial ended,

14:18.232 --> 14:20.401
she hit her head.
It was a freak accident.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.361
Was it?
An accident?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.488
-What are you implying?
-She's the reason you almost

14:24.530 --> 14:25.823
went to jail.
You must've been pretty upset.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.992
Why?
I didn't go to jail.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.494
-It all went away.
-Because Abbott thought

14:30.536 --> 14:32.496
you were a really good kid.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.039
Did you prove him wrong?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.835
We should go.
We'll go.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.211
-I'm not done here.
-Go.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.379
But you can wait in the car.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.590
We are done.
My daughters

14:42.631 --> 14:43.799
will be home soon, so...

14:49.513 --> 14:50.931
Have a good one.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.892
What the hell is wrong with you?

14:52.933 --> 14:56.520
Me? Look, do you want
to solve the case

14:56.562 --> 14:58.105
or do you just want
to antagonize that guy?

14:58.147 --> 15:01.317
I need to know
what happened in 1996

15:01.358 --> 15:04.528
so I can figure out
who would come after Abbott now.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.323
That is how you conduct
an investigation.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.367
You just accused Logan
without evidence.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.786
You're not yourself right now.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.955
-I'm trying...
-To control me?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.875
You cannot take it
if I don't want to do things

15:17.917 --> 15:21.462
the way that you want to do
things, so you keep pushing.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.256
-You never leave anything alone.
-Is this you talking?

15:26.258 --> 15:29.345
-Is it the poisoned water?
-Find your own ride home.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.654
Ace sent you to babysit me?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.614
Dude's been so dramatic all day.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.282
You abandoned him at Logan's.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.952
Abandoned?
He was slowing me down.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.412
Do you really think
Logan hurt Maggie?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.997
I think we need to figure out

15:57.039 --> 15:58.499
if Maggie's fall
was really an accident.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.043
WOMAN:
Logan asked me out

16:01.085 --> 16:02.878
a few times in high school.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.380
But he wasn't my type.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.466
A few times?
Sounds needy.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
My friends told me
to be flattered.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.512
He broke into your house.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.514
That's not flattering,
it's creepy, right?

16:13.555 --> 16:15.182
It was a goof.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.434
My accident put everything
into perspective.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.188
Okay, do you mind telling us
about that, please?

16:21.230 --> 16:23.399
I'd had a few drinks at a party

16:23.440 --> 16:25.192
and decided to walk home alone.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.611
Not the smartest move.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.030
I tripped and hit my head
on the curb.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.662
I changed my life with one
misstep, and I did it to myself.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.373
What I put my parents through--
they still help support me.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.543
I get such terrible migraines
I can only teach part-time.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.004
NANCY:
There was one of these
in Abbott's office.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.381
You collect horse statuettes?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.176
(chuckles)
Since I was a little kid.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.721
I was so grateful I even
brought him a thank-you gift.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.514
Did any of them disappear

16:55.556 --> 16:57.850
the night Logan
broke into your home?

16:59.893 --> 17:02.563
Where did you find that?

17:02.604 --> 17:04.356
Sorry, what was that?

17:04.398 --> 17:07.776
Just trying to have it all
and... succeeding.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.737
NANCY:
George and I went
to Abbott's office

17:09.778 --> 17:13.782
and liberated that bad boy. We
think Logan stole it from Maggie

17:13.824 --> 17:15.701
when he broke into her house
and then gave it to Abbott

17:15.743 --> 17:18.996
-as a thank-you gift.
-Maybe some kind of power play?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.622
Logan seems sus.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.625
But he has no motive
to poison Abbott.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.044
Abbott gave him a free pass.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.046
Exactly, so,
if Logan hurt Maggie,

17:27.087 --> 17:30.049
as I suspect, Abbott could've
prevented the attack.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.592
But Abbott let Logan walk.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.135
This is what happens
when men let

17:33.177 --> 17:34.928
their emotions make
their decisions for them.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.222
But Judge Abbott?
I really thought that

17:37.264 --> 17:39.308
he was above
all this old boys' club crap.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.894
Do you think Maggie or someone
close to her came after Abbott?

17:41.935 --> 17:44.813
But Maggie said that
she was alone when she fell.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.066
-That it was an accident.
-NANCY: Well, she's

17:47.107 --> 17:48.984
wrong.
Abbott was poisoned,

17:49.026 --> 17:50.569
and it has something
to do with this trial.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.988
Otherwise he wouldn't
try and destroy the file.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.990
We need Maggie's medical records

17:55.032 --> 17:56.575
to figure out
what actually happened to her.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.160
Ace, hey, you're up.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.162
Go to the records room,
get us what we need.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.998
-Physically?
-I'm a hacker.
I get it done with my fingers.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.583
Don't tempt me.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.126
Look, it has to be you,

18:06.168 --> 18:07.461
you've got
the morgue credentials,

18:07.503 --> 18:09.046
which you still have because

18:09.088 --> 18:10.631
-I got you out of jail.
-Yeah, for something

18:10.672 --> 18:11.965
-that I didn't do.
-Come on.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.675
Be a team player.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.427
Show us you're
more than just eye candy.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.641
Wow.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.398
Hey. Um, yes, actually,
I was just wondering...

18:28.440 --> 18:30.150
Is he flirting with her?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.780
Are you...
being possessive?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.784
(Ace clears throat)

18:40.494 --> 18:42.913
These all validate
Maggie's story.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.624
See, the shape
of her head wound is

18:45.666 --> 18:47.376
consistent with hitting a curb.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.002
This can't be right.
Did you get all her files?

18:49.044 --> 18:52.172
Yes. X-rays,
photos, blood tests.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.632
They even sent her records

18:53.674 --> 18:55.551
to a head trauma specialist
in Bangor.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.846
There's no medical reason to
believe that Logan hurt Maggie.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.014
What, you flirt with one nurse,
and then all of a sudden

19:01.056 --> 19:03.684
you're a medical expert?
(chuckles)

19:03.725 --> 19:05.519
I'm kidding.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.188
As if I care who you flirt with.
Also, you had no shot.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.402
What, you can't
take a joke now?!

19:21.118 --> 19:22.578
Okay, no.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.539
N-No, no, no, n...
That's it, enough.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.000
No more sad truffle shaving.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.961
Talk to me, please, now.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.588
Okay.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.382
For weeks, Nancy's been
pushing me away. She said

19:35.424 --> 19:37.968
it's because she cared about me.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.929
That she had to. She was
protecting me from a curse.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.098
But today,
she's treating me like I'm...

19:43.140 --> 19:45.434
Yeah, like an object.
A piece of meat.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.477
A big old flank steak.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.355
And I know it's not
her fault she's, like,

19:50.397 --> 19:51.899
she's not herself.
She's been poisoned.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.234
She can't even see that
she's being awful.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.695
-But it still...
-Hurts.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.865
She's hurting you.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.742
You know, you don't
need to make excuses.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.994
Your feelings are valid.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.247
Whatever toxic bro-ness
is affecting Nancy,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.291
we will solve the case,

20:09.333 --> 20:12.211
find an antidote,
and get her back to normal.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.087
Well, we're already keeping
our distance from each other.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.756
I'll just make it more distance.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.966
Just put on the armor.
Hope I don't run into her.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.426
Okay.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.679
Keep an eye on dinner.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.389
I am gonna back
to the historical society

20:24.431 --> 20:25.891
and research a way
to alleviate the poison.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.935
There must be something
that we can do.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.020
Okay, hold tight,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.564
stir the sauce, please.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.274
And I'll be back soon.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.485
-Okay.
-Okay? I appreciate you.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.819
Appreciate you.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.279
But keep an eye out for lumps.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.365
-No lumps.
-No lumps.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.420
Ace.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.340
I'm sorry.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.510
I've been horrible.

21:01.551 --> 21:05.472
You're a great guy.
The best guy.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.224
I need you in my life.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.185
How can I make us okay?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.938
Let's not do this
right now, okay?

21:13.897 --> 21:15.691
You were right earlier.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.192
I haven't told you everything.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.529
But I will.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.030
I'll tell you
all about the time

21:22.072 --> 21:25.367
we did get together.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.704
No. I'm done.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.917
Are you rejecting me?

21:33.959 --> 21:36.044
I'm not rejecting you.
I mean...

21:36.086 --> 21:38.380
-Hey!
-(grunting)

21:50.017 --> 21:51.643
Hey.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.945
(grunts, groans)

22:01.987 --> 22:04.239
-Hey!
-(thudding)

22:04.281 --> 22:07.242
Dial Bess, please.
Bess, please.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.666
Clear-i-tea.
A mild,

22:14.708 --> 22:17.586
mystical sedative.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.713
It won't undo the poison
but it should

22:19.755 --> 22:22.632
give you some, well, clarity.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.802
-Temporarily, at least.
-What, like I'm a lightweight?

22:39.691 --> 22:41.693
There she goes.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.321
Did it work?
Is she all right?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.698
(gasps)

22:46.740 --> 22:50.035
Ace, I'm so sorry
that I attacked you.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.870
I should be feeling remorse.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.122
And I want to...

22:54.164 --> 22:55.874
but it is not there.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.959
The tea is working.
It's allowing her to have

22:58.001 --> 23:00.420
a removed perspective
on what she's going through.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.633
What are you going through?

23:05.133 --> 23:08.053
For weeks, I've had
all these complicated,

23:08.095 --> 23:12.182
painful th... things
that I feel for you.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.975
That anguish of not
getting to be with you.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.811
Fear that
I'll get you killed.

23:15.852 --> 23:19.481
The guilt that follows.
And then I got hit with this...

23:19.523 --> 23:23.068
water, and it's like all those
feelings are locked away.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.278
I can't get to them,
and all I feel

23:25.320 --> 23:27.572
is this anger.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.866
Shuts down everything else.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.284
GEORGE:
So, basically, it's like
what could happen

23:31.326 --> 23:32.869
if you'd been
raised to be masculine

23:32.911 --> 23:35.247
-with a capital M.
-Hence dealing with pain

23:35.288 --> 23:37.207
by acting tough and aggressive.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.834
Responding to a "no"
by trying

23:38.875 --> 23:41.336
to assert
your dominance over Ace.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.131
-That's how it felt.
-(phone vibrates)

23:44.172 --> 23:45.507
(Bess chuckles)

23:45.549 --> 23:48.510
-You are never gonna guess.
-Hmm?

23:48.552 --> 23:52.097
Ryan found a supernatural
stomach pump.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.391
-Oh...
-Yup, never would've
guessed that.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.810
BESS:
Wow, yeah, he's been doing
relic recon on the Glasses

23:56.852 --> 23:58.478
since they stole
my shipment of artifacts,

23:58.520 --> 24:01.231
and they have
an occult purification device.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.899
We can use it
to remove the effects

24:02.941 --> 24:04.401
of the tainted water
from Nancy.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.361
Well, uncuff me.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.156
Got to go get my hands on that
hot lobster guy's family relic.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.577
Sorry.
The tea is wearing off.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.628
Nancy. George. Handcuffs.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.299
I caught a case of toxic
gender-swapped masculinity.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.093
Long story. I'll try
not to say anything degrading,

24:30.135 --> 24:31.178
like how good
your arms look in that shirt.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.262
-Hey.
-Sorry.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.055
But you should be flattered.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.849
Anyway, the only way
to get this toxicity out of me

24:35.891 --> 24:38.435
is with a supernatural
stomach pump your parents have.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.688
I don't mess with their relics.
I prefer the simple sea life.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.190
NANCY:
Which is why you need your boat.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.733
The one that got impounded
because of me.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.860
I get why you don't
want to help me again.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.488
And I'm gonna get
your boat back. Either way.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.740
You're asking me to break
into my parents' stash.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.159
If I do that, I need assurance

24:54.201 --> 24:58.079
to make sure I get
this stomach thing back.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.748
-So they don't notice it.
-We've learned our lesson

24:59.789 --> 25:01.208
offering collateral
to the Glasses.

25:01.249 --> 25:04.669
What did my parents do?
Don't answer.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.129
But I'm not like them.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.840
I believe you.
And that's not just

25:08.882 --> 25:10.008
because you're
the only option here.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.594
You want some assurance?

25:13.803 --> 25:15.764
Here, take this.

25:15.805 --> 25:19.059
It's very important to me.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.437
We good?

25:26.858 --> 25:28.985
You ready to say
goodbye to toxicity?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.445
-Um, don't really feel like
I'm that tox...
-Shush.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.155
(grunting)

25:36.076 --> 25:38.245
GEORGE:
Okay. Just a moment. Good?

25:38.286 --> 25:41.248
-Yeah.
-There you go.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.375
(pump hissing)

25:48.421 --> 25:50.465
(grunting)

25:50.507 --> 25:53.260
Hey, you got this, Nancy.
It's gonna be okay.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.145
BESS:
Okay...

26:05.146 --> 26:06.356
Are you okay?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.233
-Oh!
-Whoa!

26:08.275 --> 26:09.317
Oh, my God!

26:09.359 --> 26:10.777
NICK:
What did you eat?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.245
Yeah.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.747
Just an overwhelming
amount of emotion

26:22.789 --> 26:24.666
flooding back at once.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.711
Everything that was being
suppressed by Abbott's water.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.008
I'm so sorry.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.926
It's fine.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.595
Probably just come out
with seltzer water.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.556
(scoffs)
My dinner is doomed.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.101
We've seen this before.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.229
NICK:
It's the same sludge
that came out of

26:46.271 --> 26:47.981
the eight reanimated corpses
before they...

26:48.023 --> 26:50.859
-crumbled into a heap.
-Wait, what does this have to do

26:50.900 --> 26:52.861
with Judge Abbott
being poisoned?

26:52.902 --> 26:54.571
There's more going on here
than we realize.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.031
(scoffs)

26:57.282 --> 26:58.992
Things weren't adding up,

26:59.034 --> 27:01.578
so I hacked into Maggie's
medical records from 1996,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.747
ones that were sent
to a head trauma specialist

27:03.788 --> 27:06.708
in Bangor
for a phone consultation.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.002
I compared the photos
in the Bangor files

27:09.044 --> 27:11.046
with the ones from Palley
General right here in town.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.506
Now, these photos
should be identical.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.924
They have the same timestamp.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.259
But the wounds look different.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.886
This has two gashes.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.512
A curb wouldn't
leave these marks.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.264
Based on those lacerations,

27:21.306 --> 27:23.224
it looks like
Maggie was hit with an object.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.060
GEORGE:
I'm still not a doctor,
but those lacerations

27:25.101 --> 27:27.437
fit the shape of that horse.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.439
Which would confirm
Nancy's theory

27:29.481 --> 27:30.940
that Logan attacked Maggie.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.151
If that's the case,
someone not only altered

27:33.193 --> 27:35.111
Maggie's medical records
in Horseshoe Bay,

27:35.153 --> 27:36.529
they changed her actual memory.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.823
We've seen
memory erasing before.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.826
Logan was so forthcoming
about Maggie's accident.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.787
It's like he didn't even know
he had anything to hide.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.955
You think his memories
were altered, too?

27:45.997 --> 27:47.499
Wait, but what about Abbott?
He suddenly cares about

27:47.540 --> 27:49.084
something that
happened 20 years ago?

27:49.125 --> 27:52.170
After drinking
supernaturally tainted water.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.591
If Abbott's memories
of the attack were altered,

27:56.633 --> 27:58.718
then drinking the water
must have restored them.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.805
A memory so upsetting
it triggered a heart attack.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.140
Okay, say the water
did that to Abbott.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.477
Why did it turn Nancy
into a ticking toxic rage bomb?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.022
NANCY:
When I attacked Ace,

28:11.064 --> 28:14.067
I wasn't just
trying to hurt him,

28:14.109 --> 28:16.945
I was compelled
to hit him in the head.

28:16.986 --> 28:20.281
And I used that horse.
That can't be a coincidence.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.367
Something in the water
made you want to relive

28:22.409 --> 28:25.412
-Logan's attack on Maggie?
-More like Logan's mindset

28:25.453 --> 28:28.748
and emotions of the crime
mystically latched onto me.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.335
Like when I absorbed the lust
from the wedding dress.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.337
(short chuckle)
Yeah, but less fun.

28:34.379 --> 28:38.133
Did someone want Abbott
to remember what happened?

28:39.592 --> 28:41.302
Spiked his water?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.179
NANCY:
If you're gonna
spike anybody's water,

28:43.221 --> 28:44.931
why not spike Logan's?

28:44.973 --> 28:47.600
All Abbott did was
make a horrible judgment call

28:47.642 --> 28:49.561
on the case of a teenage boy

28:49.602 --> 28:52.480
breaking into his crush's house.
That's a small case.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.566
Could be it wasn't
so small for Abbott.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.943
He was up for reappointment
at the time he gave Logan

28:56.985 --> 28:58.945
his "boys will be boys" pass
for the break-in.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.573
That is all kinds
of disappointing.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.074
ACE:
So, because Logan wasn't in jail

29:03.116 --> 29:05.034
he was able
to go assault Maggie.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.745
NICK:
If that's true,
Logan could have gone back

29:06.786 --> 29:08.830
to Abbott to ask for help.
Stay out of jail again.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.790
Did Abbott try
to make all this go away

29:10.832 --> 29:13.543
to protect his reputation
and his job?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.420
BESS:
Could Abbott and Logan
have pulled off

29:15.462 --> 29:18.256
some kind of massive
supernatural coverup?

29:18.298 --> 29:20.675
How?
And what does it have to do

29:20.717 --> 29:22.469
with the eight
re-animated bodies

29:22.510 --> 29:24.304
and the sludge they released?

29:24.345 --> 29:27.766
Uh, and why is this coverup
coming undone now?

29:44.073 --> 29:45.784
Hey, it's-it's just a little bit

29:45.825 --> 29:47.577
-of a mishap.
-You know, usually

29:47.619 --> 29:49.496
I love British
understatement, but,

29:49.537 --> 29:52.165
wow, I knew I should have
called off dinner.

29:52.207 --> 29:56.461
You were gonna call off
dinner before all of this?

29:56.503 --> 29:58.963
You never wanted me
to meet your parents, did you?

29:59.005 --> 30:01.841
Fine. You're right.
You got me.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.844
Why? 'Cause I'm the soup?
And you just

30:04.886 --> 30:07.639
-knew-- you knew that
they were gonna hate me.
-No, no!

30:07.680 --> 30:10.517
It's because I didn't want them
to ruin what we have.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.520
My parents are not
just particular.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.231
They're involved.
In everything I do

30:16.272 --> 30:17.774
and-and everyone I date.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.276
It...
Look, they will call you

30:20.318 --> 30:22.529
and they will text you
and they will

30:22.570 --> 30:23.905
judge you.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.242
Look, the problem is I...

30:29.369 --> 30:30.870
I really like you, Bess.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.914
And I'm terrified

30:32.956 --> 30:35.083
that they're
gonna scare you off.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.960
(chuckling, sniffling)
Have you seen me?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.840
I don't scare.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.676
Easily.
Okay?

30:44.717 --> 30:48.304
I say bring them on.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.391
They're gonna love me.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.102
And if they don't?

30:54.143 --> 30:56.521
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.066
Okay?
This dinner is happening.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.818
Okay?

31:04.779 --> 31:06.865
We're here to apologize.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.117
Brought a little something
for the girls.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.830
Yeah, come in.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.961
I'm still trying to figure out
why you let Logan walk

31:20.003 --> 31:21.754
after he broke
into Maggie's house.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.173
I thought he was just
a boy with a crush. Harmless.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.175
Even if you believed that
at the time, a few weeks later

31:26.217 --> 31:28.011
you found out that wasn't true.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.971
GEORGE:
You told me to stay away
from Maggie because

31:30.013 --> 31:31.848
you didn't want me
to figure out what you did.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.725
But we know everything.
We know...

31:33.766 --> 31:35.101
NANCY:
You followed Maggie home

31:35.143 --> 31:36.436
with the horse
you stole from her.

31:37.812 --> 31:40.398
Maggie, s-stop.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.275
Enough.
Leave me alone.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.777
NANCY:
When she turned you down again,

31:44.819 --> 31:47.530
you snapped
and nearly killed her.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.410
This isn't an apology.
This is an absurd accusation.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.704
-You need to go.
-You don't remember

31:54.746 --> 31:56.247
attacking her, but you know
you're capable of it.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.999
Oh, I know what this is.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.084
Yeah, you're trying
to cancel me.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.337
You're one of those people
that manufactures reasons

32:02.378 --> 32:04.923
to destroy innocent men.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.133
You know how it felt
when Maggie rejected you.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.928
-It was humiliating.
-I have daughters.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.138
-I...
-NANCY: You want
to protect them?

32:12.180 --> 32:15.016
From whom-- men like you?

32:15.600 --> 32:18.561
Is that why you lift?
So you can beat up any guy

32:18.603 --> 32:20.313
who won't take no for an answer?

32:20.355 --> 32:23.024
Hey, I-I'm sorry,

32:23.066 --> 32:24.817
I really thought that
she was gonna apologize.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.028
She brought these stickers
and everything. I'll get her

32:27.070 --> 32:29.155
out of your hair.
Let's go, come on.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.996
NICK:
There must have been

32:37.038 --> 32:39.415
some other reason
that you helped him.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.501
Please, tell me there was
a gun to your head

32:41.542 --> 32:43.044
or-or that your family
was threatened.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.421
I... I-I've made some mistakes

32:45.463 --> 32:47.382
in my career
that I'm not proud of.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.592
Mistake?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.594
This was more than a mistake.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.389
Logan came to you
with the weapon from the crime

32:54.430 --> 32:56.057
and asked for your help.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.310
Wait here.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.105
You covered up
an attempted murder

33:02.146 --> 33:04.232
-to ensure that you'd
get reappointed.
-You don't know

33:04.273 --> 33:06.150
what it's like
to have to decide between...

33:06.192 --> 33:08.236
My prospects
and doing the right thing?

33:08.277 --> 33:09.696
Judge Abbott, you

33:09.737 --> 33:11.656
were my prospect
of becoming a lawyer,

33:11.698 --> 33:13.783
but I am giving
all of that up right now

33:13.825 --> 33:16.869
to get justice for Maggie,
because that is what matters.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.205
You're a judge.
How-how do you not know that?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.707
Maggie spent the last 20 years

33:20.748 --> 33:23.251
suffering from
what Logan did to her

33:23.292 --> 33:24.919
and blaming herself
for what happened,

33:24.961 --> 33:27.588
while you and Logan
lived normal, healthy lives.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.762
You remember now?

33:34.804 --> 33:36.848
What you did
to Maggie that night?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.601
You'll never be able
to prove that.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.270
Nobody will believe you.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.106
Tell us how you changed
the hospital photo.

33:45.148 --> 33:48.067
No, I didn't.
It was all Abbott.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.611
Abbott knew how to do it.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.156
I didn't remember what
the horse statue really was.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.908
-I-I thought it was a gift.
-Until today, when you
drank the water

33:55.950 --> 33:58.036
-and the memories came back.
-How did you cover it all up

33:58.077 --> 34:00.621
-in the first place, hmm?
-Leave this alone, George.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.666
I am no longer
interested in your advice.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.376
I will figure out
how you did this

34:05.418 --> 34:07.128
-and I will expose you.
-I'm warning you.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.546
If you pull this thread,

34:08.588 --> 34:11.090
everything will fall apart.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.850
GEORGE:
Logan's behavior should've been
stopped before it escalated.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.351
This was not your fault.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.729
You deserve to know the truth.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.814
But if Logan attacked me,
why do I have

34:26.856 --> 34:29.025
a distinctly different memory?

34:29.984 --> 34:31.360
And why were my medical records

34:31.402 --> 34:33.613
changed in Horseshoe Bay
but not Bangor?

34:33.654 --> 34:35.406
I really wish we could
answer that right now.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.159
We're getting closer
to figuring out

34:38.201 --> 34:41.954
how Abbott and Logan did this,
and I promise we will.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.082
This is a lot to take in.

34:45.291 --> 34:46.709
But you were right to tell me.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.628
Thank you.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.633
Should we load
the trays by courses?

34:53.674 --> 34:55.051
They're here.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.302
(whimpers)

34:58.137 --> 34:59.639
-We've got this.
-Yeah.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.890
-Okay.
-(knocking)

35:02.683 --> 35:03.935
Come in.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.481
Mr. and Mrs. Soctomah,

35:08.523 --> 35:10.358
it is such a pleasure
to meet you guys.

35:14.570 --> 35:15.822
(weak chuckle)

35:19.826 --> 35:21.160
Hey.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.873
I made some calls.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.543
The Jolene has been sprung.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.794
Pleasure doing
business with you.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.420
Mm.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.721
It's a beautiful necklace.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.181
Oh, thanks.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.143
The locket was my mom's.

35:45.184 --> 35:48.354
I've worn it every day
since she passed.

35:48.396 --> 35:52.108
And the compass
was my birth mother's.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.526
It's all I have of her.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.279
I was adopted, too.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.489
So, thanks
for trusting me with these.

35:58.531 --> 36:01.492
Can I help? My arms don't just
look good in a shirt,

36:01.534 --> 36:04.370
they actually have excellent
fine motor skills.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.247
Mm.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.012
Thanks.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.598
You and your arms

36:23.639 --> 36:26.058
have a great night.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.938
(chuckles)

36:33.900 --> 36:35.610
GEORGE:
Thanks for being there today.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.361
I just wish
I could have done more.

36:37.403 --> 36:41.115
People like Abbott have enabled
the Logans of this world

36:41.157 --> 36:42.366
to go unchecked forever.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.285
Today, you checked him.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.828
And the best part is

36:45.870 --> 36:47.788
it is so clear
you're gonna keep doing it.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.042
That means more than you know.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.339
So...
(short chuckle)

36:56.380 --> 36:57.965
can I help you with Jade?

36:58.966 --> 37:00.384
Oh...

37:00.426 --> 37:01.928
What are you
actually looking for here?

37:01.969 --> 37:05.348
Be honest. PR coaching?
A date? A hook-up?

37:05.389 --> 37:07.516
(sighs)

37:07.558 --> 37:08.893
A conversation.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.853
I want to get to know them.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.688
In a real way.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.316
(bell jingles)

37:16.442 --> 37:18.361
Here's your chance.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.781
(chuckles)

37:21.822 --> 37:24.575
My hat found a publicist.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.286
Oh.
Is it trending now, or...

37:27.328 --> 37:30.456
I was heavy
on the shop talk, huh?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.334
Talking about work is my crutch.

37:33.376 --> 37:37.129
I lean on it when I get nervous.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.090
Hmm.

37:39.131 --> 37:41.550
Do all your networking meetings

37:41.592 --> 37:43.970
make you nervous, or...

37:44.011 --> 37:46.264
Wow, was I that bad

37:46.305 --> 37:48.099
that you couldn't even tell
it was a date?

37:49.267 --> 37:51.978
Okay, that's...
good feedback.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.355
No, no, I-I...
I obviously knew it was a...

37:54.397 --> 37:57.400
(clears throat) ...a date, uh,
not-not even a question, so...

37:57.441 --> 37:59.944
Hm, bad at lying.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.697
That's the opposite
of a red flag.

38:02.738 --> 38:03.990
(chuckles)

38:05.449 --> 38:09.120
So, um, what are you
doing right now?

38:09.161 --> 38:12.123
Going on a...

38:12.164 --> 38:13.457
date-date.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.711
I hope.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.423
Okay.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.466
(knocking)

38:25.886 --> 38:28.180
Apology bagels?

38:28.222 --> 38:30.808
With a side of pickles.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.978
Tough crowd.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.274
Here's what it is:

38:38.316 --> 38:41.444
I was afraid
of my feelings for you.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.654
And then I experienced
what it was like

38:43.696 --> 38:45.906
to have those feelings

38:45.948 --> 38:47.825
locked up, out of my reach.

38:47.867 --> 38:53.039
I became
so frustrated and angry.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.083
I couldn't be myself.
I turned into a monster.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.793
And I never want
to feel like that again.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.129
And no one should ever
have to feel like that.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.006
So...

39:03.507 --> 39:06.052
I'm ready to tell you
how I know about the curse.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.515
We spent

39:11.557 --> 39:13.642
days together.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.772
The most amazing days.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.151
And then it was all taken away.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.404
And you died in my arms.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.324
That's a terrible,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.201
terrible hallucination.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.577
It didn't feel like
a hallucination.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.954
It felt so real.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.999
I'm sorry.

39:38.793 --> 39:42.338
I was only thinking about this
from my perspective.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.840
-I know.
-I got frustrated,

39:44.882 --> 39:46.926
I even got... I got angry

39:46.967 --> 39:49.303
when you wouldn't tell me
what I wanted to hear.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.389
Well, I tried
to kill you earlier

39:51.430 --> 39:54.016
for rejecting me, so...

39:54.058 --> 39:55.976
let's call it even.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.898
I'm still terrified
of losing you.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.693
But I think
that we owe it to ourselves

40:04.735 --> 40:06.445
to at least try

40:06.487 --> 40:09.031
to find a way to be together.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.825
Yeah.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.036
Yes, that's all I want.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.710
Can you tell me, like,
some good things

40:21.752 --> 40:23.712
-from this hallucination?
-Mm...

40:25.589 --> 40:28.801
So that I m-I might know
what I have to look forward to.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.887
What do you want to know?

40:31.929 --> 40:33.305
Well, everything.

40:34.890 --> 40:36.976
We went for a walk.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.436
That's how it started.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.693
♪ ♪

40:45.734 --> 40:48.154
(bell jingles)

40:49.822 --> 40:52.575
Hey, George.
Got your text.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.368
-What's going on?
-I just can't stop

40:54.410 --> 40:56.120
thinking about what Abbott said.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.788
What thread are we pulling?

40:57.830 --> 40:59.331
What is going to fall apart?
It doesn't feel like

40:59.373 --> 41:00.833
the coverup ends with him.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.668
It feels much bigger than that.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.753
And then I remember
how it started.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.381
How Abbott took one drink.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.508
And then how the eight corpses
released the sludge

41:09.550 --> 41:12.511
not far from
the town reservoir, and...

41:12.553 --> 41:14.972
WAITRESS:
Can I get you some more water?

41:18.726 --> 41:21.937
Um... Nick,

41:21.979 --> 41:24.899
I think there's
something in the water.
