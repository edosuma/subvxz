00:04.079 --> 00:05.062
My husband and I are adopting.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.396
But the last thing I'm gonna let

00:06.490 --> 00:07.914
happen is for you to pull
the same vanishing act

00:08.067 --> 00:09.842
-on my kid.
-I'm not going anywhere.

00:09.993 --> 00:12.419

00:19.595 --> 00:21.836
You ruining Mina's life

00:21.856 --> 00:23.338

00:23.357 --> 00:26.917
I'm in Atlanta for
my yearly Moyamoya checkup.

00:26.935 --> 00:28.176
<i> I have a surprise for you.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:31.030
Is that little prince your son?

(indistinct announcement

00:34.426 --> 00:36.760
IRVING:
Uh, it seems you, Pravesh,
could be a father.

00:36.779 --> 00:39.038
There's no way that is my kid.
Nadine would've told me.

00:39.265 --> 00:41.448
Are you sure?
She did say she had a surprise.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.451
-That's the definition
of a surprise.
-Wait, wait!

00:44.603 --> 00:46.378
Shh.

00:49.775 --> 00:52.551
-When was the last time
you spoke to her?
-(sighs)

00:52.778 --> 00:55.387
When she went back
to her country, you know,

00:55.614 --> 00:56.704
we spoke every few days.

00:56.799 --> 00:58.298
Then a couple months went by,

00:58.450 --> 01:00.801
and-and then she called and said
she wanted to stop it

01:00.953 --> 01:02.286
and that we should move on.

01:02.304 --> 01:03.804
And I-- and-and she was right.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.213
-Mm.
-What?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.641
Or she stopped because
she was pregnant.

01:07.793 --> 01:10.218
There's no way.

01:10.312 --> 01:12.887
All right? It's been,
what, something like...

01:12.907 --> 01:14.222
ten or 11 months.

01:14.316 --> 01:15.723
How old do you think
that kid is?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.317
I don't-- I didn't really get
a good look at him,

01:17.469 --> 01:19.803
but I'd say
three or f-four months.

01:19.822 --> 01:21.305
So, mathematically speaking,

01:21.398 --> 01:23.999
it's within the realm
of possibility.

01:25.402 --> 01:26.734
(sighs)

01:26.829 --> 01:29.037
Oh, my God, you know...

01:30.149 --> 01:32.666

I-I'm a resident.

01:32.818 --> 01:35.335

with-with one bedroom.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.096
Nadine and this kid,
they live across the world.

01:37.247 --> 01:38.931
Well, you have to go find out.

01:39.158 --> 01:40.340
No, I-I just need a minute.

01:40.492 --> 01:43.084
Nadine texted earlier
and said that she'd be

01:43.104 --> 01:44.919

So there's time.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.271

-Okay.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.999

can start operating again,

02:02.197 --> 02:04.348

02:04.366 --> 02:08.961

two of Chastain's best surgeons.

02:09.797 --> 02:10.963
Oh, stop with the ego.

not "the two best."

10:30.797 --> 10:31.855
So you married him?

10:31.873 --> 10:33.206
No. No.

10:33.358 --> 10:36.709
He was old and rich
and terrible.

10:36.862 --> 10:40.530
-(chuckles)
-I said, "No more,"
but my father didn't listen,

10:40.623 --> 10:43.032
and the next man,
he made more sense.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.560
Well, Azad, he's...

10:46.721 --> 10:48.313
...he's beautiful.

10:48.464 --> 10:49.964
Thank you.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.483
I love him so much.

10:51.634 --> 10:53.710
(Azad babbling softly)

10:53.728 --> 10:55.654
But I'll be honest.

10:55.881 --> 11:00.158
When I first got back home,
I thought about you a lot.

11:00.309 --> 11:05.312
But I got through it,
and I'm hoping you did the same.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.648
I'm hoping you found
someone amazing.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.501
You know how it is.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.911
I've been busy, and just...

11:12.063 --> 11:13.672
Not a lot of time, you know.

11:13.823 --> 11:16.916
Well, I have a full day
of scans and bloodwork

11:17.068 --> 11:19.903
and appointments,
but this was nice.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.846
Maybe we can catch up
more later?

11:21.998 --> 11:24.974
-Text me if you have time.
-Uh, will do.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.853
IRVING:
Well, that's disappointing.

11:29.005 --> 11:30.246
You had the perfect opportunity
to tell her

11:30.339 --> 11:32.673
you were dating
a contessa or something.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.693
-(chuckles) Well,
that would be a lie.
-Whatever.

11:34.844 --> 11:36.677
I think you're disappointed
it's not your baby.

11:36.771 --> 11:38.938
-(laughs)
-You would've liked having
a little Prince Pravesh.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.848
I don't need a royal infant.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.684
What I need is
some stability in my life.

11:43.778 --> 11:45.111
Oh, and by the way, that date

11:45.263 --> 11:46.520
that you engineered for me
last night was terrible.

11:46.614 --> 11:49.023
She was uninsured and looking
for free medical advice.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.283
(chuckles):
Sorry about that.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.210
My night was great,
thanks for asking.

11:52.437 --> 11:54.028
I locked down
our elopement venue.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.622
-Amazing. Where?
-Eloping means it's a secret.

11:56.775 --> 11:58.791
And you're sure you don't want
your best friend there?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.052
Eloping also means it's private.

12:01.204 --> 12:02.795
All right, well, look,
I really hope

12:02.889 --> 12:04.705
to celebrate
with you guys properly.

12:04.799 --> 12:07.541
And someday I hope to go
on a date with a woman

12:07.635 --> 12:09.543
who isn't looking
for free medical care.

12:09.637 --> 12:10.729
Wrong way.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.789
Dude, I'm doing
the best I can do.

12:12.791 --> 12:15.108
No, that.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.363
(exhales)

12:22.817 --> 12:24.650
Hi, there. I'm Dr. Pravesh.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.745
-Myra.
-Hi, Myra.

12:26.896 --> 12:27.895
This is Dr. Feldman.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.472
Tell us what happened.

12:29.565 --> 12:32.141
What happened is the nice lady
in the ambulance

12:32.193 --> 12:35.979
gave me a shot of the good stuff
and now I'm flying high.

12:36.072 --> 12:37.404
IRVING:
Pain meds will do that.

12:37.499 --> 12:39.406
But what happened to get you
into the ambulance?

12:39.501 --> 12:43.002
Right, that.
Well, I was cruising along,

12:43.154 --> 12:45.263
doing a little business,
and bam.

12:45.414 --> 12:47.173
I'm upside down with this.

12:47.325 --> 12:49.008
What do you mean,
"doing business"?

12:49.160 --> 12:52.845
Mm, fine, I was texting.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.331
But only because
it was an emergency.

12:55.350 --> 12:57.925
-Nothing is that urgent.
-Oh. So says a person

12:58.019 --> 12:59.669
who isn't
in the business of love.

12:59.762 --> 13:01.854
One of my clients
was trying to cancel a date,

13:01.948 --> 13:04.449
and Matchmaker Myra
does not let cold feet

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
stop eternal happiness.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.538
I set up marriages between
Indian Americans in Atlanta.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.366
You don't say.

13:13.518 --> 13:14.626
Stop.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.777
Please. I'm all over this.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.038
No ring,
a faint look of desperation.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.707
-You're available.
-He definitely is.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.450
No, he's not. Myra,

13:23.545 --> 13:26.120
before we can fix your arm,
we need to order a CT

13:26.214 --> 13:27.864
to make sure
that you didn't damage

13:27.957 --> 13:29.474
anything more serious, okay?

13:29.701 --> 13:30.716
Okay.

13:30.869 --> 13:31.976
We'll be back.

13:32.128 --> 13:35.063
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

13:35.965 --> 13:37.373
This is fate. This is kismet.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.150
This is the universe
working to help you

13:39.302 --> 13:41.060
-never go on another bad date.
-No.

13:41.212 --> 13:42.695
That is texting while driving.

13:42.881 --> 13:45.156
I don't want to be set up.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.308
(sighs)

13:47.327 --> 13:49.719
JAKE:
So, what do you think?
Ovarian torsion?

13:49.812 --> 13:51.478
Appendicitis?

13:51.573 --> 13:53.406
Uh, the symptoms
are nonspecific.

13:53.558 --> 13:55.892
Uh, guys, I need someone
to speak human, not doctor.

13:55.985 --> 13:58.411
(fetal heartbeat pulsing)

13:58.505 --> 14:00.296
Tina has gallstones.

14:01.082 --> 14:03.416
That's why you're in pain.

14:03.568 --> 14:04.658
Will she be okay?

14:04.827 --> 14:06.752
Well, she has slight gallbladder
wall thickening

14:06.905 --> 14:09.572
with pericholecystic fluid.

14:09.591 --> 14:11.382
Acute cholecystitis.

14:11.609 --> 14:13.309
Again, human please.

14:15.671 --> 14:19.023
So, your gallbladder is showing
early signs of infection.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.675
And normally we would just
take it out in the OR.

14:21.769 --> 14:22.935
What about the baby?

14:23.088 --> 14:25.179
That's what
makes this complicated.

14:25.198 --> 14:29.775
Any surgery, even routine,
is a risk for the baby.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.519
What about an, uh, IR perc tube?

14:32.614 --> 14:36.432
Not an option at the moment
with the recent staff cuts.

14:36.451 --> 14:39.268
Okay, uh, if we treat
with antibiotics,

14:39.362 --> 14:41.695
we could potentially get her
through this and then

14:41.715 --> 14:44.883
go into surgery
after she delivers in six weeks.

14:45.034 --> 14:48.219
Uh, but if-if you don't respond

14:48.405 --> 14:50.704
and you worsen,
then we'd be taking you

14:50.798 --> 14:52.414
to surgery in much worse shape.

14:52.467 --> 14:55.226
So I put the baby in danger
to save myself

14:55.378 --> 14:58.621
or I put myself in danger
to save the baby. (stammers)

14:58.714 --> 15:00.273
What do I do?

15:03.219 --> 15:06.129
I will talk you through
all your options

15:06.147 --> 15:08.907
so you can make
an informed decision, okay?

15:09.058 --> 15:10.816
GREGG:
And we'll be here.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.494
Whatever you decide.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.639
Can we call your parents
for you?

15:16.732 --> 15:18.141
No. No.

15:18.159 --> 15:19.751
No, don't-don't call my parents.

15:19.902 --> 15:21.310
I'm 19 and I can do this
by myself, okay?

15:21.329 --> 15:24.172
JAKE:
O-Of course you can.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.817
You guys don't have to be here.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.427
I-I'm sure you have busy lives.

15:29.578 --> 15:33.322
Stop. Uh, there is nowhere else
we'd rather be than right here.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.224
♪ ♪

15:44.002 --> 15:45.001
I got it.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.778
You're eloping
at the Four Seasons.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.004
(scoffs) Too expensive.

15:48.097 --> 15:49.522
Four Seasons Total Landscaping?

15:49.674 --> 15:51.174
Really?

15:51.267 --> 15:53.434
I'm just saying,
I'm a really good witness.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.995
Yeah. No.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.125
Myra, your CT results are in.

16:01.352 --> 16:02.293
You got lucky.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.963
A few broken ribs,
but... but nothing major.

16:05.114 --> 16:06.889
Oh. That's why my chest hurts.

16:06.949 --> 16:08.466
IRVING:
All the nerves and vessels
in your arm

16:08.693 --> 16:12.044
are intact, so we can reduce it
and put it back right here.

16:12.197 --> 16:14.046
But don't worry,
we're gonna numb you first.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.048
You shouldn't feel any pain
when we put your arm

16:16.201 --> 16:17.976
back in place, all right?

16:19.871 --> 16:21.128
(Myra inhales sharply)

16:21.222 --> 16:22.538
MYRA:
Oh.

16:22.707 --> 16:25.891
I want to admit you overnight
for observation, okay?

16:26.044 --> 16:28.728
Fine. I'll distract myself
by observing you

16:28.880 --> 16:31.823
to see if you're worthy
of my matchmaking skills.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.640
I don't need matchmaking.

16:33.735 --> 16:36.494
-(clears throat)
-How did your parents meet?

16:36.645 --> 16:38.054
-Well...
-Allow me.

16:38.072 --> 16:39.572
It was an arranged marriage.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.982
They were blissfully in love
and produced the bright

16:42.002 --> 16:43.392
but stubborn doctor
you see before you.

16:43.527 --> 16:46.987
They were lucky
and it was a different time.

16:47.081 --> 16:48.748
Now, let's focus
on getting your arm

16:48.900 --> 16:50.041
back to where it belongs.

16:50.193 --> 16:52.401
-I'm not ready. I need a minute.
-No thinking.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.570
-One, two, three.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.389
-(bones crack)
-Ow!

16:57.425 --> 16:58.832
Ooh.

16:58.926 --> 17:01.911
(laughs softly)
That, uh, wasn't so bad.

17:02.004 --> 17:06.082
Seems like the anticipation
was worse than the actual event.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.359
A bit like getting match-made.

17:09.921 --> 17:12.513
(elevator bell dings)

17:12.607 --> 17:13.756
What happened?

17:13.775 --> 17:15.033
JAKE:
Tina's infection
is getting worse,

17:15.184 --> 17:17.201
and the IV antibiotics
aren't working.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.537
Tina, we'll take
good care of you.

17:19.688 --> 17:23.124
Yeah, and we'll see you just as
soon as you're out of surgery.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.103
Jake, I know you've told
a thousand families

17:27.196 --> 17:28.954
their loved one
is in good hands.

17:29.107 --> 17:31.883
-It's time for you
to trust that.
-Okay.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.426
-Okay.
-I got her.

17:35.113 --> 17:37.346
Let's find you two
a place to get some fresh air.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.736
How are you feeling?

17:51.887 --> 17:55.981
Like the pain meds are working.

17:56.134 --> 17:58.651
You didn't have to stay.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.653
You don't have anyone else here.

18:00.805 --> 18:05.141
Well, I'm grateful you're here.

18:05.234 --> 18:09.253
Being alone for this,
(sighs) it sucks.

18:10.072 --> 18:11.405
Yeah.

18:11.499 --> 18:15.501
Sickle cell can be a nightmare.
I know that firsthand.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.096
A patient?

18:21.159 --> 18:23.584
It was a friend of mine
in medical school.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.511
You know, he was a great guy.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.179
Best person I ever knew.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.398
What happened to him?

18:31.760 --> 18:34.003
-Oh. I'm-I'm sorry.
-No, no.

18:34.138 --> 18:35.947
I shouldn't have even
brought it up.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.506
Just that you remind me
of him a little bit.

18:37.525 --> 18:41.452
Right, because of the whole
impending death thing.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.787
No, no.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.513
It's your compassion.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.533
The way you handle yourself
with such grace,

18:47.685 --> 18:49.252
even through the pain.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.779
You know,
medicine has come a long way

18:52.799 --> 18:54.114
since he was
fighting sickle cell.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.450
Yeah, that's why I keep going.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.787
You know, possibility for
new discoveries on the horizon.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.382
Got to keep your hope up
and all of that.

19:03.534 --> 19:04.717
(pained groan)

19:04.869 --> 19:07.645
-My stomach. (exhales)
-(monitor beeping rapidly)

19:07.796 --> 19:10.148
(groaning)

19:10.984 --> 19:14.318
-Her heart rate is spiking.
-Rose, I got you.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.046
Up the pain meds.

19:17.064 --> 19:18.656
We'll get you to CT.

19:18.883 --> 19:21.200
(panting)

19:27.241 --> 19:30.226
Are you sure
we can't call Tina's parents?

19:30.244 --> 19:33.504
Uh, to be honest,
we're-we're not actually sure

19:33.731 --> 19:35.764
she told them she's pregnant.

19:35.766 --> 19:36.899
She doesn't talk about them.

19:36.992 --> 19:38.009
We get the feeling
there's a rift.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.251
Yeah, and legally,
she's an adult,

19:39.404 --> 19:42.254
so we have to respect
her wishes.

19:42.407 --> 19:45.183
I can't imagine my children
feeling like

19:45.410 --> 19:48.227
they couldn't tell me
if they were in trouble.

19:50.415 --> 19:52.523
-Why is it taking so long?
-Hey, hey.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.109
No news can be a good sign.

19:56.587 --> 19:58.938
Tell you what.
Why don't I go and see

19:59.032 --> 20:01.607
if I can find out
how it's going, okay?

20:01.759 --> 20:03.993
Thanks.

20:06.764 --> 20:09.782
-CHU: Her blood pressure's
dropping.
-(monitor beeping steadily)

20:09.934 --> 20:11.024
What's happening with the baby?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.409
CHU:
Baby's heart rate's

20:12.562 --> 20:14.270
-all over the place.
-(fetal heartbeat increases)

20:14.363 --> 20:17.940
Oh, signs of fetal distress.
We need OB in here now!

20:17.959 --> 20:19.792
Oh, Tina's gallbladder's
adhered to the wall.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.219
Get ready for an open surgery.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.945
Scalpel.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.463
We've got to get
this baby out now.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.724
-I can get it done
in two minutes.
