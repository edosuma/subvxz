WEBVTT

00:08.081 --> 00:10.712
Okay, here we go.
Big-movie voice.

00:10.721 --> 00:13.199
I should've peed
before I did this...

00:14.987 --> 00:20.239
[beeping]

00:22.514 --> 00:25.432
[beeping continues]

00:25.507 --> 00:28.752
- ...is next.
- Let's meet some Froggers!

00:28.761 --> 00:31.079
- The biggest...
- Wow! That was action!

00:32.587 --> 00:34.479
Oh, we're gonna get wet.

00:35.627 --> 00:39.112
Are there more famous Damons
or Kyles in the world?

00:39.187 --> 00:40.952
- Kyles. Easily.
- What? NO way.

00:41.027 --> 00:43.912
What about Damon Dash?
What about Damon Wayans?

00:43.921 --> 00:45.552
What about Damon Wayans Jr.?

00:45.627 --> 00:48.592
You said yourself
and you dad for Damans?

00:48.601 --> 00:50.719
Hey, man, it counts.

00:50.794 --> 00:52.792
It does. You guys are cool.

00:52.867 --> 00:55.352
Each week six contestants
go head to head

00:55.427 --> 00:59.432
to win the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack.

00:59.507 --> 01:02.312
Can you feel the excitement?
Here we go!

01:02.387 --> 01:03.632
Ohh!

01:03.707 --> 01:06.952
- Joe's still holding on.
- Oh, my goodness!

01:06.961 --> 01:09.312
They each have three lives.

01:09.387 --> 01:12.672
- Here we go onto the next one.
- Ohh!

01:12.747 --> 01:16.472
But only the fastest
and the froggiest will survive

01:16.547 --> 01:20.752
to earn themselves
a shot at the $100,000

01:20.827 --> 01:22.719
in the season finale.

01:22.794 --> 01:25.312
This is the shot.
He's going over the bar!

01:25.387 --> 01:27.112
Let's go!

01:27.187 --> 01:28.679
- Sorry. My hands are...
- That's okay.

01:28.754 --> 01:30.632
You should have moisturized
beforehand next time.

01:30.641 --> 01:35.439
Every little thing
is gonna be all right! Wow!

01:36.554 --> 01:37.912
Yes!

01:37.987 --> 01:40.512
- I'm Damon Wayans Jr.
- I'm Kyle Brandt.

01:40.521 --> 01:43.159
And this is "Frogger!"

01:49.634 --> 01:51.472
Tonight six Froggers
will leap lily pads,

01:51.481 --> 01:54.392
hop highways,
and splash through swamps.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.279
I'm psyched
to be here with them.

01:56.354 --> 01:57.912
You're psyched
to be here with them.
- So psyched.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.912
- This is gonna be great.
- All for the chance

01:59.987 --> 02:02.432
to take home
a beautiful '80s fashion item,

02:02.507 --> 02:06.112
a golden fanny pack,
with $10,000 cash inside.

02:06.187 --> 02:08.912
Just to be clear, though,
the cash is in today's money.

02:08.987 --> 02:11.912
We didn't budget for 40 years'
worth of inflation.
- Correct.

02:11.987 --> 02:13.505
Let's take a look
at this crossing.

02:13.581 --> 02:16.119
Believe me, this one
is gonna be so much fun. It's...

02:18.387 --> 02:21.152
Froggers must pass the powerful
jets of the waterfall,

02:21.227 --> 02:24.432
then call for the turtles
and jump a ride to the logs

02:24.507 --> 02:27.679
or take a tough shortcut
through the spinning lilies.

02:27.754 --> 02:31.232
Once they've traversed
the up-and-down local lilies,

02:31.307 --> 02:34.472
Froggers then need to ride
the gators and scale the rocks

02:34.547 --> 02:38.599
before swinging home to
the safety of the landing pad.

02:39.154 --> 02:43.159
Okay, who do we have here
about to cross Ribbit River?

02:45.794 --> 02:48.992
My name is Keith Jennings. I'm
32 years old from Dallas, Texas.

02:49.067 --> 02:52.232
I'm a criminal justice
and forensics science
high school teacher.

02:52.241 --> 02:55.112
And I train mascots
in the summertime.

02:55.121 --> 02:56.912
One thing about Frogger
that I love

02:56.987 --> 02:58.312
is you never know what's coming.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.039
It's just like being a mascot.

03:00.114 --> 03:01.432
You think you're in the clear,
and next thing you know,

03:01.441 --> 03:04.112
you run into a pole.
Unpredictable.

03:04.187 --> 03:07.352
My name is Kaitlin Barrett.
I'm 31 years old.

03:07.427 --> 03:09.192
I'm a CEO
of a digital marketing agency,

03:09.267 --> 03:10.872
and I'm
from Seattle, Washington.

03:10.947 --> 03:13.872
I think I've been training
for "Frogger" my whole life.

03:13.947 --> 03:15.752
I've competed in so many sports.

03:15.827 --> 03:17.952
I've competed in swimming,
in diving,

03:18.027 --> 03:20.512
in soccer, in track and field.

03:20.587 --> 03:22.152
I was born to compete,

03:22.227 --> 03:24.999
and that's
why I'm gonna win "Frogger."

03:26.321 --> 03:28.432
Keith Jennings of Dallas, Texas

03:28.441 --> 03:31.232
is standing on the shoulders
of other mascot luminaries

03:31.307 --> 03:33.832
like the San Diego Chicken,
the Phillie Phanatic.

03:33.907 --> 03:36.032
What can he do on Ribbit River?

03:36.107 --> 03:38.272
Now, in Frogger,
the rules are simple.

03:38.347 --> 03:39.912
Each Frogger starts
with three lives.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.592
You fall in the water,
you lose a life.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.759
Whoever completes the crossing
with the most lives intact

03:43.834 --> 03:47.079
or gets the furthest,
moves on to the next level.

03:47.154 --> 03:48.352
Man, what is this?

03:48.361 --> 03:50.312
Straight
into adjacent waterfalls.

03:50.387 --> 03:52.752
Oh, my God.
That looks so scary.

03:52.827 --> 03:54.439
It's brutal.

03:56.121 --> 03:57.512
Terrifying water jets.

03:57.587 --> 04:00.832
300 gallons of water
per millisecond

04:00.907 --> 04:02.752
will knock you
clean into the water.

04:02.761 --> 04:05.399
Take it. Take it. Ohh!

04:05.474 --> 04:09.512
Down goes Frogger Keith.
A quick life spent.

04:09.587 --> 04:11.032
Wayans, what happened there?

04:11.041 --> 04:13.799
Uh, many things, all wrong.

04:13.874 --> 04:15.599
Maybe that was
a mascot pratfall.

04:15.674 --> 04:17.912
You know, they're always
looking for laughs.

04:17.987 --> 04:20.512
- That splash, man.
- That was so good.

04:20.587 --> 04:23.079
[laughing]

04:23.154 --> 04:24.552
It's like "Tenet."

04:24.627 --> 04:26.799
That's right.
That is like "Tenet."

04:28.361 --> 04:31.512
Kaitlin, this is
your first life.

04:31.587 --> 04:34.792
- Ready, Frogger 2? Here we go.
- Yes!

04:34.867 --> 04:36.872
She is so tiny.

04:36.947 --> 04:39.472
Seattle's own Kaitlin Barrett
sizing up

04:39.481 --> 04:41.472
what we call
adjacent waterfalls.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.872
And she's gotta get out of the
way of those water cannons fast.

04:44.947 --> 04:46.312
Doesn't have the size

04:46.387 --> 04:48.192
to withstand
the battering of the cannons.

04:48.267 --> 04:50.992
Is gonna have to rely on speed
and how nimble she can be.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.952
- You got it. You got it.
- Oh, my God!

04:53.027 --> 04:55.792
This thing is tough.

04:55.801 --> 04:57.712
Oh, my gosh.
My heart's in my throat.

04:57.721 --> 04:59.312
Oh, oh, oh! Ohh!

04:59.387 --> 05:02.312
See, again,
there's no margin of error.

05:02.387 --> 05:05.032
It is like one of those
bug zappers. Bzzz! Bzzz!

05:05.107 --> 05:07.312
He's like, "Hold up.
Somebody on me.

05:07.321 --> 05:09.072
Bzzz! Get off me!"

05:09.147 --> 05:11.472
Where's this waterfall from,
Damon? What are its roots?

05:11.547 --> 05:13.839
- Chicago.
- Chicago. A Chicago waterfall.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.672
You see 'em all the time
in downtown Chicago.

05:15.747 --> 05:17.399
Southside. Sure. Yes.

05:17.474 --> 05:19.792
Big White Sox fan,
this waterfall.

05:19.801 --> 05:21.832
Huge White Sox fan. [laughs]

05:21.907 --> 05:23.312
Wow.

05:23.387 --> 05:25.312
There's plenty more
where that came from.

05:25.321 --> 05:28.152
Check out their second lives.
Here you go, Keith.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.672
- I got it.
- All right, Keith!

05:30.747 --> 05:32.512
- Great job!
- Careful, Keith.

05:32.587 --> 05:33.912
Oh, he's down.

05:33.987 --> 05:35.272
I was literally
just about to say

05:35.347 --> 05:37.072
this should be
an easy jump for him.

05:37.147 --> 05:40.912
It's called the Cabash.
Great Cabasher, Damon Wayans Jr.

05:40.987 --> 05:43.472
Hey, I like the Cabash.

05:43.547 --> 05:45.599
Kaitlin Barrett,
Seattle Washington.

05:45.674 --> 05:47.112
Life number 2.

05:47.121 --> 05:49.312
Climb the top
of that first steppingstone.

05:49.387 --> 05:51.112
And she's off!

05:51.187 --> 05:52.919
Oh, down she goes.

05:52.994 --> 05:55.392
Can't underestimate, folks,
the water cannons.

05:55.467 --> 05:56.952
It's fatiguing, annoying.

05:56.961 --> 05:59.312
- Yeah. It's watery.
- It's so watery.

05:59.387 --> 06:03.552
Who will leap to victory
and who will croak

06:03.627 --> 06:05.952
on their third and final life?

06:06.027 --> 06:08.512
Here comes Keith onto Tony.

06:08.587 --> 06:09.912
Oh, yeah! You got it!

06:09.987 --> 06:12.112
- Ow!
- Hang on!

06:12.121 --> 06:14.232
Will he go shortcut
to the lily pad

06:14.307 --> 06:17.312
or go directly
to Tony's brother, Tommy?

06:17.387 --> 06:18.579
Shortcut.

06:18.654 --> 06:21.472
And we're onto the lily pad.
All right.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.712
Tommy's over there like,
"How come nobody talks to me?"

06:24.787 --> 06:26.872
Tommy, you're gonna take
this disrespect?

06:26.881 --> 06:28.672
"Hey, nobody's
coming over here."

06:28.681 --> 06:30.352
Italians are not
gonna like this.

06:30.427 --> 06:32.912
No. You might have
submissions on your head.

06:32.987 --> 06:34.912
"Dear, Mr. Damon,

06:34.987 --> 06:37.719
I don't like it. Stop."

06:39.307 --> 06:41.232
Keith could've gone
to the second turtle

06:41.307 --> 06:43.232
and had the shorter jump,
but in taking the shortcut,

06:43.307 --> 06:46.432
he has bought himself
a showdown with this jump.

06:46.507 --> 06:51.512
It's a big 7-foot jump here
on one of those 14-foot logs.

06:51.587 --> 06:53.179
They're 2 1/2 feet wide.

06:53.181 --> 06:56.119
They are way, way more
challenging than they look.

06:59.067 --> 07:02.112
And he's holding on!
He's alive! He's alive!

07:02.187 --> 07:04.512
- He stuck it.
- Yes, sir!

07:04.587 --> 07:06.152
That's how you play Frogger.

07:06.227 --> 07:08.992
So now he's on the local lilies
which go up and down.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.799
Oh, you made it!

07:12.347 --> 07:15.032
They go eight feet
off the surface of the water.

07:15.107 --> 07:16.352
What is this?

07:16.427 --> 07:18.112
And it's seven feet
between them,

07:18.121 --> 07:20.152
one of the toughest stages
of the whole crossing.

07:20.227 --> 07:23.312
Well, Mama,
this is where it ends.

07:23.387 --> 07:26.999
Oh, Keith.
Don't bring Mama into this.

07:29.401 --> 07:31.312
This is gonna hurt
like a son of a gun.

07:31.387 --> 07:33.032
Big jump coming up right now.

07:33.107 --> 07:36.312
Here we go!

07:36.387 --> 07:37.799
Ohh!

07:45.354 --> 07:47.872
Here on Ribbit River,
Keith is updating his will

07:47.947 --> 07:50.592
as he's about to make the jump.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.912
- Ohh!
- Oh, my...

07:52.921 --> 07:54.792
Wow! That was action!

07:54.867 --> 07:57.032
Let's take a look
at the replay.

07:57.107 --> 07:59.272
Hey...gravity.

07:59.347 --> 08:01.432
I think he wanna knock
himself out for a second.

08:01.507 --> 08:03.592
And now Keith Jennings
can take a ride

08:03.667 --> 08:07.912
straight towards the Rock Arena
for a big finish.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.392
Bring your ugly self here.
Come on.

08:09.467 --> 08:10.719
The gators await.

08:11.507 --> 08:13.992
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Get me up. Get me up.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.832
- Yes.
- Yep. Yep. Yep.

08:16.841 --> 08:19.072
He is getting close now, folks.
We're in the red zone.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.312
He's getting close,
but he is exhausted right now.

08:21.387 --> 08:23.232
You can just see it
in his posture.

08:23.307 --> 08:25.239
Come on right here.

08:28.387 --> 08:29.785
Wow.

08:29.861 --> 08:32.232
Tallyho! Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

08:32.307 --> 08:35.632
Let's go, Crocodile Dundee.
Come on.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.792
Ohh! Keith.

08:37.867 --> 08:40.192
Now, get up.
We got one rock left.

08:40.201 --> 08:41.392
This is incredible.

08:41.401 --> 08:42.992
Oh, yeah!

08:43.067 --> 08:44.992
Damon, we're almost there.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.432
One swing on Hollywood Vine
and he's home.

08:47.507 --> 08:48.952
Mama, this for you.

08:49.027 --> 08:52.112
15 1/2 feet. Can you clear it?

08:52.187 --> 08:55.799
Ohh! Ohh! Push off.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.399
Ohh! [squeals]

08:59.474 --> 09:01.872
- He's gonna fall.
- You need to look away?

09:01.947 --> 09:04.512
Oh, no!

09:04.587 --> 09:08.632
Keith at the one-yard line
goes into the water.

09:08.707 --> 09:10.752
Just short of that landing pad.

09:10.827 --> 09:13.192
Oh, that's heartbreaking.
That's tough to see.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.712
That one hurt. That one hurt me.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.072
This right here?
Right here, baby? In the heart?

09:17.147 --> 09:19.432
That hurt my<i> corazón,</i> dude.

09:19.507 --> 09:21.392
Very simple for Kaitlin.

09:21.467 --> 09:23.952
She needs to get
all the way through

09:24.027 --> 09:25.992
to Hollywood Vine,
our rope at the end,

09:26.067 --> 09:29.079
or she will be going home.

09:31.027 --> 09:32.699
Hang on. Hang on.

09:32.701 --> 09:35.159
Fighter for life right here
from Kaitlin.

09:37.747 --> 09:39.952
Oh, great jump.
And she's holding on.

09:40.027 --> 09:42.439
Come on, Kaitlin.
Pull yourself up.

09:44.034 --> 09:46.159
Hang on. Hang on.
One more. One more.

09:47.707 --> 09:49.799
There you go. There you go.

09:50.954 --> 09:53.152
Hang on. Hang on! Hang on!

09:53.227 --> 09:54.452
- She's clinging on.
- Wow!

09:54.527 --> 09:55.912
- She won't quit.
- Wow!

09:55.987 --> 09:57.192
[chanting]
Kaitlin! Kaitlin!

09:57.267 --> 09:59.352
Kaitlin! Kaitlin!
Come on now.

09:59.427 --> 10:02.319
Kaitlin reaching for the rope.

10:06.227 --> 10:08.952
We're onto the first
steppingstone, Wayans!

10:08.961 --> 10:11.392
- Come on, baby! Let's go!
- Yeah!

10:11.467 --> 10:13.552
[laughing]

10:13.627 --> 10:16.799
Kaitlin! Oh!

10:18.467 --> 10:19.952
All right.
Little rock. No problem.

10:20.027 --> 10:21.432
Wayans, are you getting

10:21.507 --> 10:23.592
a little tingle in your finger
about Kaitlin?

10:23.667 --> 10:24.992
- I'm getting tingling.
- All right.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.752
Here comes Tony.
Come on, Kaitlin.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.392
That's a fanny-pack look
if I've ever seen one.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.592
Oh, oh, oh!

10:31.667 --> 10:33.592
Wow! Wait.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.952
Is she gonna do this?

10:36.027 --> 10:38.792
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, Kaitlin!

10:38.867 --> 10:40.192
Kaitlin!

10:40.267 --> 10:42.112
Yeah. Wait for it. Wait for it.

10:42.187 --> 10:44.312
That is a long jump
for a little lady.

10:44.387 --> 10:46.559
She's spinning with it.

10:46.634 --> 10:49.472
Incredible. She's trying to turn
the turntable backwards.

10:49.547 --> 10:51.592
You can hear the devil talk
if you do that. Be careful.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.592
Yeah.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.992
Ahh! It looks so far.

10:56.067 --> 10:57.759
Can she do this?

10:57.834 --> 10:59.272
Huge ask.

10:59.281 --> 11:02.152
She knows exactly
what she has to do.

11:02.227 --> 11:04.392
It is all on the line.

11:04.401 --> 11:06.319
Kaitlin!

11:08.707 --> 11:11.159
[squealing] Kaitlin!

11:11.234 --> 11:12.592
Oh, wait, wait.
Come on, Kaitlin.

11:12.601 --> 11:13.872
Oh, my God.

11:13.947 --> 11:14.872
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.192
Aah!

11:16.267 --> 11:18.352
You gotta get those hips
up on top.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.672
That's the only way to do it.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.432
She just tapped
into some sort of animal force

11:22.441 --> 11:24.752
that I don't know
if she knew existed.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.392
I love this girl.

11:26.401 --> 11:28.992
America loves Kaitlin.
America's rooting for her.

11:29.067 --> 11:32.559
- The world is rooting for her.
- Ahh!

11:36.587 --> 11:39.472
She's down, and she's out,
and she's done!

11:39.481 --> 11:41.232
- She's done.
- Heartbreak.

11:41.307 --> 11:43.472
This is a legendary fight,
and it's over.

11:43.547 --> 11:46.712
- Great job.
- Kaitlin Barrett. You legend.

11:46.721 --> 11:50.392
What a wild, incredible battle
between Kaitlin and Keith.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.992
Keith moves on,
and he is now through

11:53.067 --> 11:55.279
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.312
Get your eye patches out, folks,

12:00.387 --> 12:03.272
'cause we are off
to Frog Skull Island

12:03.347 --> 12:05.392
Frog Skull Island
is a treacherous place

12:05.467 --> 12:07.192
full of skullduggery
and villainy.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.992
After swinging
to the Jolly Frogger,

12:09.067 --> 12:10.472
Froggers will have
to walk the planks,

12:10.547 --> 12:12.519
climb the cargo net,
and fetch a cracker.

12:12.594 --> 12:14.432
Crossing back across the deck,
they're catch a ride

12:14.441 --> 12:16.632
with Polly the parrot
to the Desert Island.

12:16.707 --> 12:18.232
Then they'll need
to get over the rocks,

12:18.307 --> 12:21.032
past the skull
and over the gators.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.192
Pelted by water cannons,
they'll make their way

12:24.267 --> 12:26.872
across the lilies
and finally to the spinning "X,"

12:26.947 --> 12:30.959
which marks the spot for their
final leap to the treasure.

12:31.034 --> 12:33.272
Froggers can also take
a shortcut

12:33.281 --> 12:35.832
from the ship
directly to the lilies,

12:35.907 --> 12:39.192
which is shorter
but much tougher.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.159
And here's some of what
will have our Froggers

12:41.234 --> 12:43.672
shivering in their timbers.

12:43.747 --> 12:45.512
The Jolly Frogger.

12:45.587 --> 12:49.272
Two tons of retracting planks
and energy-sapping climbs

12:49.347 --> 12:53.159
before a death-defying
75-foot zipline.

12:53.234 --> 12:55.752
And Devil Skull Rock,

12:55.827 --> 12:59.399
a tricky, unstable obstacle
with only 16 handholds

12:59.474 --> 13:02.599
that will eat Froggers
for breakfast.

13:04.027 --> 13:07.312
All right, lads.
It's a pirate's life for me.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.912
Jeremy Wilbur, real beard,

13:09.987 --> 13:12.032
against Blade Brady, real name.

13:12.107 --> 13:15.072
These are a couple
of the heavyweights.

13:15.147 --> 13:18.359
Hi. I'm Jeremy. I'm 40 years old
from Washington, D.C.,

13:18.434 --> 13:20.872
and I'm an artist
and e-commerce specialist.

13:20.947 --> 13:22.552
You might say
that my beard is gold.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.192
And you might say that it's
blue. Look, I'm an artist.

13:25.201 --> 13:26.712
I have a paintbrush in my hand
all the time.

13:26.787 --> 13:28.199
You never know
what you're gonna get with me.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.592
As a kid,
I used to play Frogger a lot.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.192
So my strategy's gonna be
to see if there's any shortcuts

13:33.267 --> 13:34.632
I can grab in the game.

13:34.707 --> 13:38.192
You have met your match.
I'm gonna sink you.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.952
What's up, everybody?

13:39.961 --> 13:43.392
I'm Blade. I'm 26 years old
from Los Angeles, California.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.872
I went to Harvard.
Graduated top of the class.

13:45.947 --> 13:48.072
And I am a gym owner
and a trainer.

13:48.147 --> 13:50.632
I started playing football
seriously in high school.

13:50.707 --> 13:53.792
I'm super light on my feet.
I'm super fast and agile.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.512
My signature move. My party
trick is this right here.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.879
That's about it. [laughs]

14:00.987 --> 14:03.792
- Ready, Frogger 1?
- Let's do it.

14:03.867 --> 14:05.792
Here we go.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.352
Don't forget. Each Frogger
starts with three lives.

14:08.427 --> 14:10.232
But you fall in the water,
you lose a life.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.832
Whoever completes the cross
or gets the furthest

14:12.907 --> 14:14.392
moves on to the next level.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.559
Jeremy Wilbur.
Across the rope he goes,

14:16.634 --> 14:18.432
feet forward,
onto the first plank.

14:18.507 --> 14:20.272
We've got plank walking.

14:20.281 --> 14:22.072
And there's four
of these planks.

14:22.147 --> 14:23.872
Two of them are trapped.
They're basically boobytraps

14:23.947 --> 14:25.672
and trapdoors
disguised as planks.

14:25.747 --> 14:26.672
Go big or go home!

14:26.681 --> 14:28.392
We've seen Blackbeard,

14:28.467 --> 14:31.512
Bluebeard and now Goldbeard.

14:31.587 --> 14:32.799
- Nice.
- Simple.

14:32.874 --> 14:34.472
It's not a diving board.
Take it easy.

14:34.547 --> 14:36.672
There we go.
He's now onto the cargo net!

14:36.747 --> 14:38.192
- Wow.
- Okay.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.632
We got a competition here, man.
Great start.

14:40.707 --> 14:43.912
Now, if he can get on deck,
he has a decision to make.

14:43.987 --> 14:45.832
Go to the right,
you take the shortcut,

14:45.907 --> 14:47.792
risk it all to take
your chances with the rope.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.872
More concerted approach--
stay left,

14:49.947 --> 14:51.432
get the cracker
out of the barrel

14:51.507 --> 14:53.792
to meet up with Polly
who's hungry.

14:53.867 --> 14:55.272
He's looking over at the rope

14:55.347 --> 14:57.959
as if to say,
"I'm gonna go that way."

14:58.034 --> 15:00.399
Hey, do it. Start with the rope.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.199
What's he doing? What is he--

15:05.747 --> 15:07.599
You can just climb up, buddy.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.632
What is he thinking?

15:10.707 --> 15:13.239
Ow! He can't--

15:14.787 --> 15:17.112
He tried to take a shortcut
to the shortcut.

15:17.187 --> 15:20.192
- [laughs]
- What is...

15:20.267 --> 15:22.319
Let's put a little music to that

15:22.394 --> 15:24.792
and show this ballet
one more time.

15:24.867 --> 15:27.792
[classical music plays]

15:27.867 --> 15:29.152
[laughs]

15:29.227 --> 15:32.272
And one life down.

15:32.281 --> 15:35.512
Blade Brady from California.

15:35.521 --> 15:37.512
Ready, Frogger 2?

15:37.587 --> 15:39.799
Here we go.

15:46.147 --> 15:47.712
Ooh! Blade Brady,

15:47.787 --> 15:50.552
who is named after a series
of Wesley Snipes films.

15:50.627 --> 15:52.992
- Yeah.
- How you get past this thing?

15:53.067 --> 15:54.672
I understand he has
several siblings.

15:54.747 --> 15:57.832
I think his brother's name
is Demolition Man Brady.

15:57.907 --> 16:01.112
Passenger 57 Brady, his sister.

16:01.187 --> 16:03.192
Any other siblings?
I can't remember.

16:03.201 --> 16:05.359
White Man Can't Brady.

16:06.347 --> 16:08.759
And this has already
gotten awkward.

16:08.834 --> 16:09.992
I'm surprised.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.592
What technique is this?

16:11.667 --> 16:14.392
You're supposed
to be an elite athlete.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.752
- Use your football stuff.
- Here we go.

16:16.827 --> 16:19.392
- [grunting]
- Whoa. Whoa.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.559
Aw.

16:20.634 --> 16:22.392
He's getting off
on pure body strength.

16:22.467 --> 16:25.112
If he can get on deck,
he has a decision to make.

16:25.187 --> 16:26.512
One try on the shortcut.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.152
Nah, let me try this.

16:28.227 --> 16:30.192
He goes to the barrel
for the crackers. No shortcut.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.952
There's a cracker?

16:32.027 --> 16:36.159
- He can't find the crackers.
- It says "cracker" on top.

16:38.147 --> 16:40.472
- Oh.
- My confidence in Blade

16:40.547 --> 16:42.039
is waning.

16:42.114 --> 16:43.832
Blade played football
at Harvard.

16:43.907 --> 16:45.392
30 seconds into this crossing

16:45.467 --> 16:47.592
marks the longest he's ever gone
without mentioning that.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.032
And now it's time for a ride

16:50.107 --> 16:52.312
right across the water
of Frog Skull Island.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.952
- Hold on tight.
- [squawking]

16:54.027 --> 16:56.392
- What up, Polly?
- "Hello. I'm a Harvard man.

16:56.467 --> 16:59.592
I played football there.
Did you hear?"

16:59.667 --> 17:01.119
Moment of truth.

17:01.194 --> 17:05.192
Polly takes off traveling
75 feet in six seconds.

17:05.267 --> 17:07.552
Work those knees, baby.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.352
Wait a minute.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:11.427 --> 17:13.039
Ohh!

17:21.361 --> 17:23.032
- Come on, man.
- Oh, oh!

17:23.107 --> 17:24.472
- Harvard man.
- Oh, come on!

17:24.481 --> 17:25.792
Swing!

17:25.801 --> 17:27.239
Yes! You've done it!

17:27.314 --> 17:28.792
That was a tougher hit

17:28.801 --> 17:30.712
he took from some stockbroker
who went to Yale.

17:30.787 --> 17:32.999
Sticks the landing
on the Desert Island,

17:33.074 --> 17:35.472
but this is no day at the beach.
You've done a lot of work,

17:35.547 --> 17:37.272
but it's only gonna
get harder here.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.072
Because the hardest one of all
is coming up next.

17:39.147 --> 17:41.272
That imposing, terrifying face

17:41.347 --> 17:44.472
in the middle of Frog Skull
Island is Devil Skull Rock.

17:44.547 --> 17:47.792
- This part ain't easy.
- It's 11 feet tall.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.512
It's unbelievably difficult.

17:49.587 --> 17:52.592
So he's gotta get into the skull
or on top of the skull.

17:52.667 --> 17:53.912
He's really flummoxed.

17:53.987 --> 17:55.752
This is him sitting down
for his SAT 2s

17:55.827 --> 17:57.632
before he went into Harvard.

17:57.707 --> 17:59.472
Okay, all right.
Again, the strength.

17:59.547 --> 18:01.432
Terrible form. Great strength.

18:01.507 --> 18:05.192
Fun fact:
Blade has a phobia of knees.

18:05.267 --> 18:07.152
Which is a shame
because his are great.

18:07.227 --> 18:08.439
Fantastic knees.

18:08.514 --> 18:11.159
That's not a knee.
That's a k-nee.

18:11.234 --> 18:13.919
- You pronounced the "K."
- Because it's that beautiful.

18:15.067 --> 18:17.032
- Dang.
- Three gators to get across

18:17.107 --> 18:19.072
and then we got pads
to deal with.

18:19.147 --> 18:21.519
He goes full mount
on our first alligator.

18:21.594 --> 18:24.152
- That's Jack Snappy.
- I like that way.

18:24.227 --> 18:26.672
Born to ride a gator.

18:26.747 --> 18:31.039
Got it. No problem.
Fingers in on top. We're good.

18:32.587 --> 18:34.272
Oh, my gosh.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.999
Looks like he's posing
for a shampoo commercial.

18:39.747 --> 18:41.672
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.272
Let's see the strength,
tough guy.

18:43.347 --> 18:45.272
- Yes!
- Too strong.

18:45.347 --> 18:47.152
This isn't football.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.672
The trick with the lily pad

18:48.747 --> 18:51.232
is just like in the Frogger
of the video game.

18:51.307 --> 18:53.032
Try to get the final pad
on the far end.

18:53.107 --> 18:55.999
You have to do it quickly, or
you'll be careening off screen.

18:56.074 --> 18:58.272
- And he's off. And he's on.
- Oh, my!

18:58.347 --> 19:00.072
He's on. He kept in contact.

19:00.147 --> 19:01.872
He was holding on
by mere fingers.

19:01.947 --> 19:06.399
- That's all you need.
- Even Blade's fingers have abs.

19:07.827 --> 19:09.759
Wayans, here comes Hunk Rock.

19:10.987 --> 19:15.192
A thousand gallons a minute
coming from those water cannons.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.952
This one's tough.
As you can see that finish line,

19:18.027 --> 19:19.705
that treasure chest,
it's not far.

19:19.707 --> 19:23.032
It's within your grasp. We could
get our first full crossing.

19:23.107 --> 19:25.112
Don't finish it
on the first try. Come on.

19:25.121 --> 19:26.672
Now we got a pink Harvard man

19:26.747 --> 19:29.312
with a giant head of hair
laughing at the cannons.

19:29.387 --> 19:30.872
Look at him.
Talking trash to them.

19:30.947 --> 19:34.832
- How dare you.
- This is it. Three, two, one.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.272
He's on top, and he's--
No, he's going down.

19:37.347 --> 19:40.072
He is off. Down goes Blade.

19:40.147 --> 19:43.912
He was so confident
and then so underwater.

19:43.987 --> 19:48.479
An imposing lead on Jeremy
as we look at the replay.

19:49.547 --> 19:52.192
All right.
Jeremy Wilbur is back.

19:52.267 --> 19:54.352
All right now, Polly.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.352
I'm gonna to need you
to not help him out.

19:56.427 --> 20:00.232
And here we go, folks.
We got a grip. Can he hold on?

20:00.307 --> 20:02.439
Inch by inch. Can he do it?

20:04.547 --> 20:07.432
- No!
- Oh, my goodness!

20:07.507 --> 20:08.672
Oh!

20:08.681 --> 20:10.832
That was a clean knockout.

20:10.907 --> 20:12.432
That was
crash-test dummy worthy.

20:12.507 --> 20:13.879
Yeah, it was.

20:14.827 --> 20:17.472
26-year-old Blade Brady
from Southern California

20:17.547 --> 20:19.799
about to start life number 2.

20:19.874 --> 20:22.079
Here comes Punk Rock.

20:23.081 --> 20:24.952
Down goes Blade!

20:25.027 --> 20:26.752
Two lives in the water.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.952
It was a good leap.
Leaped like a frog,

20:29.027 --> 20:31.432
but he fell like a tadpole.

20:31.441 --> 20:35.472
Come on over.
Be nice this time.

20:35.547 --> 20:37.079
Jeremy Wilbur.

20:37.154 --> 20:40.392
He needs to reach at least
Punk Rock, or he is out.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.152
Hey, look, you want some advice?

20:42.227 --> 20:45.312
Your feet are supposed
to hit it before your face.

20:45.387 --> 20:47.392
Swing 'em. Swing 'em. Swing 'em.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.392
I think he's got it. Oh, yeah!
Desert Island. He's alive!

20:50.467 --> 20:53.272
Good job, man.
That was smooth.

20:53.347 --> 20:56.072
Now he faces Devil Skull Rock.

20:56.147 --> 20:57.752
No running start.

20:57.827 --> 21:00.072
A fully stationary jump.

21:00.147 --> 21:02.272
- Terrible idea.
- That is a mistake.

21:02.347 --> 21:04.672
Three, two--Oh, no.
Not even close.

21:04.747 --> 21:07.559
Woefully short.
Three lives spent.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.352
And he is done.

21:09.427 --> 21:11.672
Which means, though,
that Blade Brady

21:11.747 --> 21:14.192
will advance
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

21:14.267 --> 21:17.352
- Whoo!
- And so Blade earns his shot

21:17.427 --> 21:20.272
at the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack.

21:20.281 --> 21:22.352
But coming up next...

21:25.954 --> 21:27.432
Bouncing to the craters,

21:27.507 --> 21:28.912
Froggers will climb
the satellite

21:28.987 --> 21:30.592
to start the launch sequence,

21:30.601 --> 21:33.712
then hit the lighted countdown
pads in the right order

21:33.721 --> 21:35.392
as they complete the course.

21:35.467 --> 21:37.672
They'll have to leap
from the second satellite

21:37.747 --> 21:41.399
to the Spinning Space Amphibian,
dodge the space jets

21:41.474 --> 21:43.392
and inch around
the Galaxy Hopper

21:43.467 --> 21:47.559
before facing the space worms
on their way to the landing pad.

21:49.547 --> 21:51.239
It might not be rocket science,

21:51.314 --> 21:53.792
but this crossing
is far from easy

21:53.801 --> 21:59.352
as our Froggers boldly go up
against the Space Amphibians.

21:59.427 --> 22:03.192
A huge 5-foot jump
onto an uneven spinning target.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.872
Timing and height
are everything.

22:05.947 --> 22:08.399
And Croakmik Station,

22:08.474 --> 22:11.592
an 18-foot traverse past
the opening golden doors.

22:11.667 --> 22:16.192
Be nimble, be quick,
or your crossing could be over.

22:16.201 --> 22:19.752
- This is crazy. Oh!
- Oh, my God.

22:19.827 --> 22:21.312
Here we go, folks.

22:21.387 --> 22:24.039
Rai Jones, claiming
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

22:24.114 --> 22:26.992
and YouTuber Kat Musni.

22:27.067 --> 22:30.072
Hi. I'm Rai Jones. I'm from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

22:30.147 --> 22:33.832
I'm 34 years old, a mother
of two, and I'm a fashionista.

22:33.907 --> 22:38.672
I love my clothes, I love
my shoes, and I love hats.

22:38.747 --> 22:41.472
My adult life, I have never
bought a pair of sneakers.

22:41.547 --> 22:44.392
I can run in four-inch heels,
and I never slip and fall.

22:44.467 --> 22:46.272
You're not seeing me coming.

22:46.347 --> 22:49.672
I'm Kat. I'm 30 years old.
I'm from Brookfield, Wisconsin.

22:49.747 --> 22:51.352
I have a social media channel

22:51.427 --> 22:54.352
where I create a ton
of home workouts for everyone.

22:54.361 --> 22:56.072
There are two sides to me.

22:56.147 --> 22:59.192
One of them is very bubbly,
very unicorn, very sparkly.

22:59.267 --> 23:02.999
And the other side is
very strong and warrior-like.

23:03.074 --> 23:04.872
And I'm definitely
gonna bring both of these

23:04.947 --> 23:06.559
when I take on "Frogger."

23:06.634 --> 23:12.072
My strategy is to get to point A
to Point B without dying.

23:12.147 --> 23:14.112
[laughing]

23:14.187 --> 23:15.672
Ready, Frogger 1?

23:15.747 --> 23:17.839
Ready, Frogger 1, yes.

23:17.914 --> 23:21.232
- Here we go.
- Aah! Okay.

23:21.307 --> 23:22.679
Rai Jones,
following in the footsteps

23:22.754 --> 23:24.672
of many illustrious
Philadelphia athletes.

23:24.747 --> 23:27.232
It's time to take those
new sneakers for a space walk.

23:27.307 --> 23:29.752
She's off onto the first
space rocket booster.

23:29.827 --> 23:32.472
She's got to jump
onto the Crustacean Crater

23:32.547 --> 23:35.152
and make her way over
to Satellite X.

23:35.227 --> 23:37.032
Either make it or you don't.

23:37.107 --> 23:38.279
She's off and she's fighting.

23:38.354 --> 23:40.072
Get up there. Get up there.

23:40.147 --> 23:41.392
She's got to get that leg up.

23:41.467 --> 23:43.472
Rai Jones. Okay.
She came to play.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.872
This is history.

23:44.947 --> 23:47.352
She's effectively the first
to walk on the moon.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.432
- And I made it!
- You made it!

23:49.507 --> 23:52.512
- You freakin' made it!
- I freakin' made it!

23:52.587 --> 23:54.432
- Okay.
- Real chatter here, right?

23:54.507 --> 23:56.512
Stop with the water.
Like, goodness.

23:56.587 --> 23:58.439
The second obstacle.

23:58.514 --> 24:00.312
Wait until she notices
the rest of the course.

24:00.387 --> 24:03.472
See that light on the bottom
of the screen right there?

24:03.481 --> 24:07.072
That is what she is going for
to start the launch sequence.

24:07.147 --> 24:09.599
5, 4, 3,

24:09.674 --> 24:12.232
2--and you guessed it--1.

24:12.307 --> 24:15.112
Oh. Oh, I think I see it.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.072
- Oh.
<i> - Launch sequence...</i>

24:18.147 --> 24:19.872
<i> - activated.</i>
- I lifted it up!

24:19.947 --> 24:24.072
There goes half the Frogger
budget, but it looks good.

24:24.147 --> 24:26.152
Fun fact about Rai:
she taught her grandmother

24:26.227 --> 24:28.672
how to use computers
by playing Frogger.

24:28.747 --> 24:30.232
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

24:30.307 --> 24:33.032
All right, she's got to get
to Countdown Platform 5.

24:33.107 --> 24:34.552
This is much harder
than it looks.

24:34.627 --> 24:37.152
- Okay.
- My fear is that Rai

24:37.227 --> 24:40.272
won't be able to make that jump.

24:40.347 --> 24:42.159
- And...
- Oh, wow.

24:42.234 --> 24:44.872
She's clinging on. She's gonna
need to get her knees up.

24:44.947 --> 24:47.472
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
Look at the determination.

24:47.547 --> 24:49.992
Wow. She's doing it for Grandma.

24:50.067 --> 24:53.079
WWGD. Would what Grandma do?

25:01.627 --> 25:04.752
Rai Jones.
You can get up there. Come on.

25:04.827 --> 25:06.719
Holding on.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.472
Yeah! Rai!

25:10.547 --> 25:11.712
Okay.

25:11.787 --> 25:14.352
<i> - T-minus 5...</i>
- Good job, Rai!

25:14.427 --> 25:17.392
These guys are too friendly.
It makes me feel unsettled.

25:17.467 --> 25:21.312
It's a competition. That is
your enemy. That is your enemy.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.319
- What about sportsmanship?
- That's after.

25:23.394 --> 25:25.552
- What about friendship?
- "Hey, great job."

25:25.561 --> 25:29.392
Friendship?
Friendship is for losers.

25:29.401 --> 25:33.352
- Okay.
- Enter the cannons.

25:33.427 --> 25:36.032
You can see them already,
gnashing their teeth.

25:36.107 --> 25:38.352
- They're tough.
- Oh, they want her bad.

25:38.427 --> 25:41.152
The alien in the background
is like,

25:41.161 --> 25:44.279
"You're not gonna make it,"
but we believe.

25:46.027 --> 25:48.752
And she's off. Spinning
Amphibian. And she's on again.

25:48.827 --> 25:51.872
You cannot stop this woman.
This is a legend in Frogger.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.952
Oh, my. She stuck the landing.

25:54.027 --> 25:55.952
She is on her first life.

25:56.027 --> 25:58.752
I'm starting to believe.
I really am.

25:58.827 --> 26:02.752
- What? Oh!
- Oh, no.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.272
- Every time I use...
- No, that's not gonna do it.

26:05.281 --> 26:06.992
She tried to use the Force,
I think, right there.

26:07.001 --> 26:10.319
- That's not gonna happen.
- I think she asked it to stop.

26:12.187 --> 26:14.879
The cannons wait for no one.

26:14.954 --> 26:18.072
- So she's on.
- She's gotta get out fast.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.152
- Oh, no! Rai!
- Rai, please get up.

26:20.227 --> 26:21.879
I'm definitely not
the Little Mermaid.

26:21.954 --> 26:24.752
Rai onto the number 4.

26:24.761 --> 26:26.512
This is Countdown Platform 4.

26:26.587 --> 26:27.832
She's got it.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.232
There you go.

26:29.307 --> 26:30.832
<i> Space station activated.</i>

26:30.907 --> 26:32.552
Oh, God.

26:32.627 --> 26:35.759
All right, that's Croakmik,
with the giant golden doors.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.752
She's over and she's on.

26:38.827 --> 26:40.432
Oh, my goodness, Rai.

26:40.507 --> 26:43.759
There is no quit in this woman.
No quit.

26:45.267 --> 26:48.472
Now, careful. Those doors
can open at any moment.

26:48.547 --> 26:50.352
They'll get you.

26:50.427 --> 26:54.472
Ohh! Down goes Rai Jones.

26:54.547 --> 26:57.199
The fashionista
falls off the runway.

26:57.274 --> 26:58.912
She really didn't like
those doors.

26:58.987 --> 27:01.232
No. She said, "I'm out of here.
Never mind the door."

27:01.307 --> 27:03.479
She's like, "No, thank you.
Gonna leave."

27:05.114 --> 27:08.872
Kat is up.
Can she match Rai at Croakmik?

27:08.881 --> 27:11.352
I gotta go. I gotta send it.

27:11.427 --> 27:13.112
- She's gotta send it.
- Gonna send it.

27:13.187 --> 27:17.279
YouTuber Kat Musni,
you can skip the ad in...

27:19.027 --> 27:20.759
You're on.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.272
Well, here we go.

27:22.347 --> 27:23.879
- Whoo!
- Oh!

27:23.954 --> 27:26.152
- Great double jump.
- Oh, my God. This is awesome.

27:26.161 --> 27:27.712
Oh, God. Okay.

27:27.721 --> 27:30.359
She's already onto
the second space rocket booster.

27:30.434 --> 27:32.152
Shot out
of the gates here, Wayans.

27:32.227 --> 27:34.192
I gotta say,
this is the most fun thing

27:34.267 --> 27:36.432
I've ever done already.
- Instant pace.

27:36.507 --> 27:39.152
You can see the athleticism
really showing here.

27:39.227 --> 27:41.472
Ooh! Okay.
I'm just gonna go like that.

27:41.547 --> 27:44.312
- And light 'em up!
- Oh, my God.

27:44.387 --> 27:45.952
Ohh! The light!

27:46.027 --> 27:48.232
- The light is freakin' awesome!
<i> - Launch sequence...</i>

27:48.241 --> 27:49.832
<i> - activated.</i>
- It's lit.

27:49.907 --> 27:53.112
- That's what the kids say.
- They also say "send it"

27:53.187 --> 27:54.752
and "it's lit."
Anything else we got?

27:54.827 --> 27:56.672
"It's lit." Um...

27:56.747 --> 27:59.032
"Get out of my room, Dad!

27:59.107 --> 28:01.352
I'm watching--
I'm watching something."

28:01.427 --> 28:03.512
This is the big one
at 6 1/2 feet,

28:03.587 --> 28:06.319
and she's got it. No problem.
That's an athlete.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.359
Kat is an athlete. Kathlete.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.832
All right, Kat.

28:13.907 --> 28:15.832
With the grace
of a professional wrestler,

28:15.841 --> 28:18.672
off the top turnbuckle,
she landed like a cat.

28:18.747 --> 28:20.832
They say you can chuck a cat
off 100 stories

28:20.907 --> 28:22.552
and they will land
right on their paws.

28:22.561 --> 28:24.232
You would never wanna do that.
It's psychotic.

28:24.307 --> 28:26.359
But Kat landed it,
and we got an athlete here.

28:27.467 --> 28:30.592
This is maybe
the toughest jump on the course,

28:30.667 --> 28:32.679
onto the Spinning
Space Amphibian.

28:33.794 --> 28:36.152
Here we go.
She's off and she is on.

28:36.227 --> 28:37.999
- Love it.
- Way to go.

28:39.194 --> 28:41.952
Got it. Confidence. Here we go.

28:42.027 --> 28:43.879
Oh, my God! [laughs]

28:43.954 --> 28:46.552
Now she's getting smashed
by those water cannons.

28:46.561 --> 28:49.712
- This is point blank.
- Geez Louise. Ow.

28:49.787 --> 28:50.912
Ow!

28:50.921 --> 28:53.552
Now you're taunting me! Okay.

28:53.627 --> 28:55.512
She's gotta get
to Countdown Platform 4.

28:55.587 --> 28:57.239
Remember, there's five of them.
She's already got five.

28:57.314 --> 28:59.032
Does she have four?

28:59.107 --> 29:01.272
Oh, she's onto the 4.

29:01.347 --> 29:03.839
<i> Space station activated.</i>

29:03.914 --> 29:05.552
All she's gotta do
is get to the platform

29:05.627 --> 29:07.199
with the Croakmik
and we have a tie.

29:07.274 --> 29:09.399
Yeah, I'm getting excited.

29:09.474 --> 29:12.359
- We got a player here.
- Yeah.

29:13.227 --> 29:14.752
Come on, Kat.

29:14.827 --> 29:16.952
Wow. Great job. Great jump.

29:17.027 --> 29:20.392
And this is the exact spot
where Rai Jones fell,

29:20.467 --> 29:22.632
which means that Kat
can take the lead.

29:22.707 --> 29:23.992
[groans]

29:24.067 --> 29:26.312
And she has it.
Kat is in the lead.

29:26.387 --> 29:28.319
It's not fair.

29:28.394 --> 29:30.679
I truly believe
that she can go all the way.

29:30.754 --> 29:34.592
She's gotta get from Croakmik
down across the space worms

29:34.667 --> 29:36.512
and onto the red
launching button.

29:36.587 --> 29:38.952
- But it all starts right there.
- Good job. I like it.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.199
She can jump now. She doesn't
have to pass door number 4,

29:41.274 --> 29:43.552
and she's onto
the Space Amphibians.

29:43.627 --> 29:45.472
Now, look, the space worms
await her.

29:45.547 --> 29:47.152
They're sort of a goofy nemesis.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.712
Hi.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.792
Very polite
to the space worms.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.512
She doesn't understand
that they don't like her.

29:52.587 --> 29:54.232
- They won't be polite back.
- Yeah.

29:54.307 --> 29:57.192
They're not gonna shake hands.

29:57.267 --> 30:01.792
Gotta time it.
They go at two seconds per bow.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.952
I am on the edge of my seat.

30:04.027 --> 30:05.992
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Get up, get up, get up!

30:06.067 --> 30:09.632
- Upper body strength. We're up.
- Four jumps remaining.

30:09.707 --> 30:13.112
If Kat finishes,
this thing is over.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.192
<i> T-minus 3...</i>

30:15.267 --> 30:18.792
One, two, three.
Let's see if you can make it.

30:18.867 --> 30:21.239
Number 2.
All she's gotta do is get to 1

30:21.314 --> 30:23.479
and then the giant red button.

30:24.627 --> 30:26.512
<i> - T-minus 1...</i>
- Okay, Kat.

30:26.521 --> 30:30.232
- We are at the precipice.
- This is the last one!

30:30.307 --> 30:32.559
Go, go, go.

30:35.027 --> 30:38.552
Eight feet. She's off, and she--
Oh, there's nothing to grab.

30:38.627 --> 30:40.552
She's gonna need
to get her knees up.

30:40.627 --> 30:43.752
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up! Yes!

30:43.827 --> 30:46.112
And the YouTuber finishes!

30:46.187 --> 30:48.952
Like, share, and subscribe!

30:49.027 --> 30:50.232
Wow!

30:50.307 --> 30:53.239
I won! Oh, my God!

30:54.267 --> 30:58.359
Kat's got big-time potential.
We are big, big fans of hers.

30:58.434 --> 31:00.119
And she is
our final Frogger through

31:00.194 --> 31:01.832
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

31:01.907 --> 31:03.752
But we know this.
Only one Frogger

31:03.761 --> 31:05.352
can be tonight's top frog

31:05.427 --> 31:08.072
and take home
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack.

31:08.147 --> 31:10.432
Stay tuned, my friends.

31:10.507 --> 31:13.599
Wow. It's so beautiful.

31:13.674 --> 31:15.959
- It is gorgeous.
- I love it.

31:18.147 --> 31:20.439
Is it on fire?

31:32.947 --> 31:35.072
He comes...

31:35.147 --> 31:39.232
from the deepest, darkest swamp.

31:39.307 --> 31:43.079
He kidnaps little baby froglets.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.792
He smells...

31:45.867 --> 31:49.039
really, really bad.

31:50.307 --> 31:52.319
He is...

31:55.107 --> 31:56.472
[grunting]

31:56.547 --> 31:58.832
- He's a big toad.
- Big and powerful toad.

31:58.907 --> 32:00.479
Powerful stench.

32:00.554 --> 32:02.192
Well, I was gonna
say powerful odor,

32:02.267 --> 32:04.599
but, yeah, Kyle, he stinks.

32:04.674 --> 32:07.232
[grunting]

32:07.307 --> 32:10.112
- That breath. Yecch!
- [passes gas]

32:10.187 --> 32:12.312
- Ooh!
- [rumbling]

32:12.387 --> 32:13.799
What's worse is that

32:13.874 --> 32:16.032
he's frognapped five froglets
and hidden them

32:16.107 --> 32:18.632
across the most challenging
Frogger crossing of them all,

32:18.707 --> 32:20.759
the Boss Toad Temple.
It happened.

32:20.834 --> 32:22.152
In the Boss Toad Round,

32:22.227 --> 32:23.672
our Froggers
each get five minutes

32:23.681 --> 32:25.879
to rescue those froglets,
as many as they can.

32:25.954 --> 32:27.872
Froggers start
in the middle of the crossing,

32:27.947 --> 32:31.472
and they can choose any route
they want to get the job done,

32:31.547 --> 32:35.632
but they only have one life,
so if they fall in, game over.

32:35.707 --> 32:37.832
Taking on
Boss Toad Temple tonight,

32:37.907 --> 32:42.032
we have Blade,
the man with no nickname,

32:42.107 --> 32:45.952
Kat, the first human
unicorn in space,

32:46.027 --> 32:47.472
but first up, it's Keith,

32:47.547 --> 32:50.392
the man who loves
a last-minute tumble.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.512
- Keith.
- Yo.

32:52.587 --> 32:54.432
- Ready, Frogger?
- Ready, Frogger.

32:54.507 --> 32:56.432
- Here we go.
- Come on, Keith!

32:56.507 --> 32:58.159
Let's go!

33:01.427 --> 33:03.432
Keith's strategizing right now.

33:03.507 --> 33:05.559
The body's facing due south.

33:05.634 --> 33:08.512
When is he gonna go?
Does he know he can go yet?

33:08.587 --> 33:10.872
I hope so, because
he's several seconds in already.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.952
Indecisiveness.
The clock is huge here.

33:13.961 --> 33:17.279
I think he's gonna go
for the closest one.

33:17.354 --> 33:19.952
Okay, you see the froglet
on the outer lip

33:19.961 --> 33:21.432
of that Venus frog trap.

33:21.507 --> 33:23.392
He's gonna go for that.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.672
This jump's big here.
That's a huge one.

33:25.747 --> 33:27.752
You can see the froglet
if you look very closely

33:27.827 --> 33:30.152
between those two
green stalagmite teeth,

33:30.227 --> 33:32.432
Don't you eat me.

33:32.507 --> 33:34.392
Oh, he can crawl. Ohh!

33:34.467 --> 33:36.912
- Getting there. Reach it.
- Absolutely.

33:36.987 --> 33:39.512
- Stay right here with me.
- And now he has the option

33:39.587 --> 33:42.432
to toss it onto Gilligreen's
Island or jump with it.

33:42.507 --> 33:44.232
- I say toss it, man.
- I love the toss.

33:44.307 --> 33:46.592
But looks like he's got it high
and tight like a running back.

33:46.601 --> 33:49.752
He's gonna jump with it, which
can inhibit your trajectory.

33:49.827 --> 33:52.272
And he's off and running,
and he's got it.

33:52.347 --> 33:54.232
All right,
now, he puts it to bed.

33:54.307 --> 33:56.032
That is one officially
on the board.

33:56.107 --> 33:59.192
- Keith Jennings came to play.
- Okay, man. My man.

33:59.267 --> 34:01.192
But we're over a minute
in wins.

34:01.267 --> 34:02.792
We have a clock here
in Boss Toad.

34:02.867 --> 34:05.432
This is not regulation.
This is the finals.

34:05.507 --> 34:08.272
All right, he's working out
where to go right now.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.592
- Big jump. Nice!
- [grunting]

34:11.601 --> 34:13.872
Come on, man! I ain't got time!
Hurry up and come on!

34:13.947 --> 34:15.352
Let's go! Move your butt!

34:15.427 --> 34:17.192
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Gotta jump now.

34:17.267 --> 34:18.712
if you're gonna take
this much time,

34:18.721 --> 34:21.832
- you better get all the frogs.
- Absolutely.

34:21.907 --> 34:24.112
You can take your time.
You can take your five minutes.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.552
- But make it count.
- Yeah.

34:25.561 --> 34:27.959
- Good job, man.
- Now it's decision-making time.

34:28.034 --> 34:30.952
You can go to Toad Temple
or left towards the helipad,

34:31.027 --> 34:33.032
and he's facing the helipad.

34:33.041 --> 34:37.432
- [grunting]
- Scales the wall.

34:37.507 --> 34:38.872
Now, there's
a big, big adventure

34:38.881 --> 34:40.832
waiting for him
if he can get up there.

34:40.841 --> 34:42.432
And there's a froglet. This is
number 2. See it right there?

34:42.507 --> 34:44.112
- Look how cute it looks.
- So cute.

34:44.187 --> 34:46.432
Look how cute
that thing looks.

34:46.441 --> 34:48.632
He frees it from his diaper
and the vines,

34:48.707 --> 34:50.632
and now you gonna go
for the leg clasp.

34:50.707 --> 34:52.112
Do not bite me!

34:52.187 --> 34:55.239
That's not nice.
That's a baby, dude.

34:56.034 --> 34:57.585
Oh, Lord!

34:57.587 --> 35:00.279
The 68-foot ride, it's all
about the dismount land.

35:00.354 --> 35:02.072
- There's your hero shot.
- I love it.

35:02.147 --> 35:03.832
- And release.
- Nice!

35:03.907 --> 35:05.232
All right.

35:05.307 --> 35:06.872
Keith Jennings, bank it.

35:06.947 --> 35:09.112
- Two.
- [grunts]

35:09.187 --> 35:10.592
Lord Jesus.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.432
Where did he go? You see
one on top of the turtle?

35:12.507 --> 35:13.952
Yeah, I'm going
on top of the turtle.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.192
Okay, now, that's
the more proximate froglet.

35:16.267 --> 35:17.879
There are two
on top of Toad Temple,

35:17.954 --> 35:21.392
but that may be out of reach
with the clock right now.

35:21.401 --> 35:23.832
And it looks like
he has chosen the temple.

35:23.841 --> 35:26.352
We gotta go, Keith.
That is a bold move.

35:26.427 --> 35:27.952
You've got just
under a minute left.

35:27.961 --> 35:30.792
This is one of Boss Toad's
toughest obstacles.

35:30.867 --> 35:33.192
Go, Keith. Go.

35:33.267 --> 35:34.872
[farts, sighs]

35:34.881 --> 35:37.752
Keith Jennings is going for it.

35:37.827 --> 35:39.552
He came to play.

35:39.561 --> 35:42.432
- He's missing one right there.
- There's a froglet right there!

35:42.507 --> 35:43.632
He just wants to see the top.

35:43.707 --> 35:45.999
Keith, you forgot your froglet!

35:46.074 --> 35:48.992
He has grabbed
the third froglet.

35:49.067 --> 35:51.432
However, there's about
15 seconds left on the clock.

35:51.507 --> 35:53.832
Can you make this thing count?

35:53.907 --> 35:58.192
Could he throw it from here 50
yards onto Gilligreen's Island?

35:58.267 --> 36:00.479
- Hail Mary!
- Lord Jesus!

36:00.554 --> 36:01.952
He's admiring the view.

36:01.961 --> 36:04.832
He decides to go
for a ride down Toad Tumble.

36:04.907 --> 36:08.552
Keith Jennings,
we love you, but time.

36:08.627 --> 36:10.992
That's five minutes.
It's all you get.

36:11.067 --> 36:14.192
His final score will be 2,
but we love watching this dude.

36:14.267 --> 36:17.072
I mean, that was
a great first effort, man.

36:17.147 --> 36:18.672
Can I get a half?

36:18.747 --> 36:21.959
He's playing for 2 1/2.
We can only give you 2.

36:22.034 --> 36:26.112
Very, very intimidating
setting here--Boss Toad Temple.

36:26.187 --> 36:30.399
Next up in her attempt to tackle
the Boss Toad Bonus Round,

36:30.474 --> 36:34.032
our super fit,
unicorn-loving friend, Kat.

36:34.107 --> 36:36.272
- Hey, Kat.
- Hi, David.

36:36.347 --> 36:38.392
You got two froglets to beat.

36:38.401 --> 36:39.952
- Okay.
- Best of luck.

36:39.961 --> 36:41.439
- Ready, Frogger?
- Yeah.

36:41.514 --> 36:43.559
- Here we go.
- Okay.

36:46.994 --> 36:49.399
Off she goes, quick,

36:49.474 --> 36:52.712
assertively towards that
proximate froglet right there.

36:52.787 --> 36:54.232
Her jumping is great.

36:54.307 --> 36:56.519
Right into the mouth
of the Venus frog trap.

36:56.594 --> 36:58.232
Wayans, she is already setting
the time record.

36:58.307 --> 37:01.232
- Come on, Kat.
- And, ooh, she tossed it.

37:01.307 --> 37:03.432
- My baby!
- Get that froggy!

37:03.507 --> 37:06.632
- I'm sorry, Timmy!
- She said "my baby."

37:06.641 --> 37:08.472
- I'm an awful mother.
- Wow.

37:08.547 --> 37:11.152
And that's the fastest
you can possibly see that done.

37:11.161 --> 37:12.712
- One Frogger bank.
- 30 seconds.

37:12.721 --> 37:16.032
Pray for Blade Brady right now.
Pray for Keith Jennings.

37:16.107 --> 37:19.192
Oh, Kat. Off and firing.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.599
I think I see
a little blood on the elbow.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.152
She loves it.
That's what wakes her up.

37:23.161 --> 37:24.479
She's going
right to the helipad.

37:24.554 --> 37:26.672
Kat still just over
the minute mark,

37:26.681 --> 37:28.192
climbing fearlessly.

37:28.201 --> 37:30.432
Look at the strength, the focus.

37:30.507 --> 37:33.592
- This is unbelievable to watch.
- Unbelievable.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.512
That's number 2.
If she can take that thing home,

37:36.587 --> 37:39.432
I'm pretty sure
she'll be in the lead.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.992
- Look at that.
- Wow.

37:41.001 --> 37:42.672
The classic alternating grip.

37:42.747 --> 37:46.392
You can put it in a textbook.
And the grin.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.279
- Kat Musni!
- She loves this.

37:48.354 --> 37:50.232
Damon, look at this.
She's about to bank it

37:50.307 --> 37:52.312
in roughly a minute and a half.

37:52.387 --> 37:53.912
She is ahead of Keith.

37:53.987 --> 37:56.832
She is in first place by far
and looking for more.

37:56.907 --> 38:00.432
This girl. Oh, my gosh!

38:00.507 --> 38:02.872
All right, lily pads,
here we come.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.512
Now the Spitting Frogs
are gonna welcome her

38:05.521 --> 38:09.559
as is the giant edifice
that is Toad Temple.

38:10.907 --> 38:12.599
- She's going to temple.
- Kat Musni--

38:12.674 --> 38:14.272
- She's going to temple.
- Say it again!

38:14.347 --> 38:16.672
She's going to temple.

38:16.747 --> 38:20.159
This is the Boss Toad Temple.
One life.

38:22.027 --> 38:24.239
And down she goes! It's over!

38:24.314 --> 38:27.519
Oh, no. Kat missed her grip,
and she's done.

38:30.067 --> 38:31.952
- It is over.
- Wow.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.672
But she is in the lead.

38:34.681 --> 38:37.752
So with just
two froglets to beat,

38:37.827 --> 38:40.919
it is time
for our final Frogger.

38:40.994 --> 38:42.592
Blade the blade.

38:42.601 --> 38:44.599
Remember how bad his form was
on Frog Skull Island?

38:44.674 --> 38:47.312
But his athleticism
is what got him through.

38:47.321 --> 38:48.792
Look at it this way.
He's a Harvard man.

38:48.867 --> 38:51.632
Did he learn anything
from that crossing?

38:51.707 --> 38:54.032
We'll find out. He knows exactly
what he has to do.

38:54.107 --> 38:57.359
Three baby froglets for $10,000.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.192
This is big, buddy.
Best of luck.

39:10.267 --> 39:12.392
- Ready, Frogger?
- Ready.

39:12.467 --> 39:13.839
Here we go.

39:19.187 --> 39:22.672
Here we go. Sheer electricity
on Boss Toad Temple

39:22.747 --> 39:25.559
as Blade Brady is off
and on top of Harriett.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.832
$10,000 hangs in the balance.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.879
And look at Boss Toad.
Blade's already quick.

39:29.954 --> 39:31.512
[grunts]

39:31.587 --> 39:33.232
The hand placement is sure.
The hands are dry.

39:33.241 --> 39:35.392
Look at the calves.
Look at the calves.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.312
Look at the hair.
Look at Blade.

39:37.321 --> 39:40.832
He cuts like a knife as he cuts
through the Toad Temple night.

39:40.907 --> 39:43.832
You ready? All right, come on.
Sorry for the view.

39:43.907 --> 39:46.232
Apologizes to the froglet
for the view.

39:46.307 --> 39:48.719
He is off
on the Hopper Chopper 1000.

39:50.587 --> 39:54.312
Beautiful form.
Sticks the landing. Yes.

39:54.387 --> 39:56.752
- [grunts]
- Record time, Wayans.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.632
Wow.

39:58.707 --> 40:00.312
Blade Brady back and running.

40:00.387 --> 40:01.872
There's another one
directly to his right.

40:01.947 --> 40:05.072
Does he get the quick point?
He's going for it.

40:05.081 --> 40:08.072
- Got it right here.
- Wow.

40:08.147 --> 40:10.872
I feel like we are seeing
a different Blade Brady.

40:10.881 --> 40:13.519
This guy is ath-le-teek.

40:17.347 --> 40:20.752
And there you go. Blade Brady
gets that second froglet down.

40:20.827 --> 40:22.312
It was awfully fast.

40:22.321 --> 40:23.752
He doesn't know, though,
if it's fast enough.

40:23.827 --> 40:26.079
He's gotta keep on going,
and he will.

40:26.154 --> 40:28.319
He's looking for 3, 4, even 5.

40:28.394 --> 40:30.312
Blade Brady
on a mission right now.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.712
He still has three minutes left.

40:32.787 --> 40:35.792
Absolutely. Time. Poise.
I'm so impressed.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.352
This is a clinic
that Blade Brady is putting on.

40:38.427 --> 40:40.752
Blade Brady.
Real name. Real game.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.912
I got time right here
to put this on. Hold on.

40:42.987 --> 40:45.312
He's putting the ponytail up.
That's gonna cost him.

40:45.387 --> 40:47.352
That's gonna cost
precious seconds.

40:47.427 --> 40:49.232
That Polamalun mane, we love it.

40:49.307 --> 40:50.832
As we round
the three-minute mark,

40:50.907 --> 40:53.312
he goes into the teeth
of Toad Temple.

40:53.387 --> 40:55.152
- This is where Kat fell.
- It's the exact spot.

40:55.227 --> 40:56.752
Does he have the handhold?
He does.

40:56.827 --> 40:59.232
- He does.
- So strong. Such an athlete.

40:59.307 --> 41:01.312
Shirt just wet
all over his muscles.

41:01.321 --> 41:04.352
- Grabs that bad boy.
- It's glorious.

41:04.361 --> 41:07.112
Does he have the precision
and the patience

41:07.187 --> 41:08.552
to finish this thing?

41:08.561 --> 41:10.719
I mean, this is
how you play Frogger.

41:12.307 --> 41:13.592
Let's go, man.

41:13.601 --> 41:16.272
Toad Temple. 20 feet down.

41:16.347 --> 41:18.752
Now look at on the 6.

41:18.827 --> 41:22.959
Oh, here it comes!
The Ball of Doom!

41:23.034 --> 41:24.552
He slipped that punch.

41:24.627 --> 41:27.392
It's 21,000 pounds,
the Ball of Doom.

41:27.467 --> 41:29.512
He has one minute left.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.512
One minute left.
Two Froggers in his hands.

41:31.587 --> 41:32.912
- Okay.
- Can he finish this thing?

41:32.987 --> 41:35.592
He tosses them
off of Gillgreen's Island.

41:35.667 --> 41:39.392
Blade Brady,
welcome to Frogger!

41:39.467 --> 41:43.439
- It is over!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

41:43.514 --> 41:45.952
Blade Brady. One of the greatest
runs we've ever seen.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.312
You are a champion.

41:48.387 --> 41:50.512
Blade looks like
he could be a $100,000 guy.

41:50.587 --> 41:52.032
- After seeing that?
- Mm-hmm.

41:52.041 --> 41:53.872
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

41:53.947 --> 41:55.872
Blade's grown up. I'm proud
of him. I'm impressed.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.592
Somebody took that blade
out the cupboard.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.112
He was in that
little sharpener thing.

41:59.187 --> 42:00.912
- Mm-hmm. Somebody like...
- [imitating sharpening]

42:00.987 --> 42:03.279
So Boss Toad
did a lot of talking,

42:03.354 --> 42:04.872
but he has been slain.

42:04.947 --> 42:08.552
And who did it?
Of course. A guy named Blade.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.872
We'll be seeing Blade again.

42:10.947 --> 42:14.272
He is our very first Frogger
coming into our finals,

42:14.347 --> 42:17.272
the Ultimate
Frogging Championship.

42:17.347 --> 42:19.839
Blade, go get it, my man.
