Oh, Lonely Blade, you so lonely.

00:21.838 --> 00:25.706
What?! The janitor is
the evil samurai president?!

00:26.275 --> 00:29.688
- That's bananas.
- Oh, come on. It was so obvious.

00:29.728 --> 00:31.979
He's been mopping in the
background of every fight scene.

00:31.981 --> 00:34.281
Look. Here he is on
the cover of the box.

00:34.283 --> 00:35.883
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

Go, Lonely, go!

00:48.197 --> 00:51.365
- Do the boomerang blade again!
- Oh, come on.

00:51.367 --> 00:54.135
This is ridiculous.
Just look at their form.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.804
This is nothing like real
sword-fighting.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.839
Shh!

00:58.841 --> 01:00.107
It's just a movie, Pearl.

01:00.109 --> 01:03.344
Well, if you ever want
to see a demonstration of proper

01:03.346 --> 01:07.382
sword techniques,
I'd be happy to show you.

01:09.385 --> 01:10.351
Now?

01:11.254 --> 01:13.054
<i>All right.
In order to give a proper</i>

01:13.056 --> 01:17.925
demonstration, I'm going
to need a sparring partner.

01:17.927 --> 01:21.962
Luckily, I have the perfect
candidate right here.

01:26.202 --> 01:30.905
- Cool! Hologram Pearl!
- Ah, geez.

01:31.974 --> 01:34.942
<i>Do you wish to engage in combat?</i>

01:34.944 --> 01:37.278
Let this be the perfect battle.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.714
<i>You've already made a mistake
by challenging me.</i>

01:42.018 --> 01:43.984
We shall let our swords decide.

01:43.986 --> 01:45.119
Nerd!

01:45.121 --> 01:46.321
- Shh!
- Shh!

Whoo-hoo!
Yay, Pearl!

02:32.618 --> 02:35.069
<i>Do you wish to battle again?</i>

02:35.071 --> 02:39.274
Pearl! That was amazing!
You were so cool!

02:39.275 --> 02:42.743
Oh, well.
One does try their best.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.112
Will you teach me to
sword-fight like you?

02:45.114 --> 02:48.315
All right, but
we should start with the basics.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.886
Initiate training mode.

02:51.888 --> 02:55.659
<i>Training mode initiated.
Level 1. begin!</i>

02:55.694 --> 02:59.360
I want you to stand back,
Steven, and watch me carefully, okay?

02:59.362 --> 03:01.128
<i>Parry! Parry! Thrust!</i>

03:01.130 --> 03:02.563
<i>Parry! Parry! Thrust!</i>

03:02.565 --> 03:06.433
<i>Do you see what I'm
doing with my feet, Steven?</i>

03:06.435 --> 03:08.135
<i>Parry! Parry! Thrust!</i>

03:08.137 --> 03:10.938
<i>Notice where I keep my
center of gravity.</i>

03:10.940 --> 03:13.621
Aww.
Can you show me something cool,

03:13.622 --> 03:14.808
like the boomerang blade?

03:14.810 --> 03:18.078
Steven, you know that's
not a real sword technique.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.814
Boomerang blade!
Boomerang blade!

03:20.816 --> 03:23.551
- Boomerang blade!
- Steven, these are real

03:23.553 --> 03:26.987
sword techniques, not those
silly things from your movie.

03:26.989 --> 03:30.224
It's about waiting carefully for
the perfect moment to ...

03:30.226 --> 03:31.792
<i>Thrust!</i>

03:32.528 --> 03:36.231
- Whoa.
- Oh, no.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.534
- Pearl?
- Whoopsy-daisy.

03:40.536 --> 03:45.172
Steven, it's okay.
I'm gonna be just ...

03:46.142 --> 03:51.478
No!
Pearl? Pearl!

03:51.480 --> 03:54.348
<i>Challenger defeated!
Level 1 failed.</i>

03:54.350 --> 03:55.516
- Steven!
- Steven!

03:55.518 --> 03:59.086
I-I was just ... and ...
and she was trying to ...

03:59.088 --> 04:02.523
Steven, it's okay.
Pearl's gonna be just fine.

04:02.525 --> 04:05.626
- What do you mean?
- Sometimes if our

04:05.628 --> 04:08.829
bodies are badly damaged, we
release our physical forms

04:08.831 --> 04:10.564
and retreat to our gems to regenerate.

04:10.566 --> 04:15.135
- So, she's gonna be okay?
- Don't worry, bud.

04:15.137 --> 04:18.038
This kind of thing just happens
sometimes ... usually to me.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.841
- Always to you.
- Hey, I'm scrappy.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.543
What do you want?

04:22.545 --> 04:28.082
So, how long will it take her to
regenerate ... 5 minutes, 10 minutes?

04:35.358 --> 04:39.960
- What's taking so long?
- What up?

04:39.962 --> 04:43.030
- He-e-ey.
- She's still not done?

04:43.032 --> 04:45.566
Man, she's really taking her
time with this one.

04:47.242 --> 04:50.904
Got to tell you, though, love
what you've done with the place.

04:50.906 --> 04:54.508
- Pearl usually helps me tidy up.
- Ah, I say leave it.

04:54.510 --> 04:59.831
Hey, if real Pearl can't be
here, there's always the next best thing!

05:00.149 --> 05:02.316
<i>Do you wish to engage in combat?</i>

05:02.318 --> 05:05.119
Steven, cover that
thing back up.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.621
But it's like Pearl!
Look at it!

05:07.623 --> 05:10.524
Ye-e-e-ah.
That ain't Pearl.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.160
Well, maybe I can get
it to act like her.

05:13.162 --> 05:16.196
Here we have... a mess.

05:16.198 --> 05:19.066
Organizing messes is one of
Pearl's favorite hobbies.

05:19.068 --> 05:23.470
Here. Pearl likes to organize
them by type ... animal,

05:23.472 --> 05:28.442
humanoid, miscellaneous.
Now you try.

05:29.612 --> 05:33.480
- You've drawn your sword in vain!
- What?! Aah!

05:33.482 --> 05:35.082
<i>Challenger defeated!</i>

05:35.084 --> 05:38.085
Maybe we need to try something else.

05:39.188 --> 05:42.389
- I'm gonna do it.
- Go on, then.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.367
Pearl always likes to tease

05:53.369 --> 05:55.636
Amethyst when she does funny
stuff like this.

05:55.638 --> 05:59.239
- I won't go easy on you this time!
- That's the spirit!

05:59.241 --> 06:01.709
What are you rascals doing over here?

06:01.711 --> 06:03.744
<i>Draw your weapon, challenger!</i>

06:05.481 --> 06:09.650
Ugh. Steven, why are you
still hanging out with that thing?

06:09.652 --> 06:11.654
It's gross.

06:12.688 --> 06:15.255
I just really miss
spending time with Pearl.

06:15.257 --> 06:19.262
Pearl will come back to
us in time, Steven. Have patience.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.464
And stop hanging out with
that thing. It's creepy.

06:23.466 --> 06:28.369
- Wh-o-o-o-o-oa!
- Hmm.

06:28.371 --> 06:30.971
You had fun at the
boardwalk, right?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.639
- Parry!
- Aw, come on.

06:32.641 --> 06:37.311
You got to work with me here.
This is Pearl's favorite tree.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.414
Don't you recognize it?
What's on your mind?

06:40.416 --> 06:42.216
Come on. Don't hold back.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.518
<i>Challenge accepted!</i>

06:44.520 --> 06:46.140
What?!

06:49.409 --> 06:51.492
Oh, no! The tree!

06:51.494 --> 06:53.026
<i>Challenger defeated!</i>

06:53.028 --> 06:55.729
Real Pearl would
never do that!

06:55.731 --> 06:57.598
Rah! You're hopeless!

06:57.600 --> 07:00.688
Get away from me!

07:03.539 --> 07:07.241
It's too bad you're still not
back, Pearl, because I just

07:07.243 --> 07:11.771
found a copy of the fifth
"Lonely Blade" movie!

07:14.350 --> 07:16.784
How long are you gonna
make me wait, Pearl?

07:17.586 --> 07:21.457
Oh, the popcorn's done.
Stay right there.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.127
<i>Do you wish to test your
skills against me in a duel?!</i>

07:27.129 --> 07:29.747
No!
No sword-fighting!

07:34.285 --> 07:37.104
<i>Draw your sword and fulfill
your destiny!</i>

07:37.106 --> 07:41.588
Huh? No!
Leave real Pearl and me alone!

07:41.710 --> 07:44.411
Go back under your sheet.

07:45.614 --> 07:48.782
<i>- Brother, is that you?
- Yes, it's me ...</i>

07:48.784 --> 07:52.252
<i>your...brother.
Your technique is...</i>

07:52.254 --> 07:55.656
Whoa!
This dub is really good.

07:55.658 --> 07:58.358
- What do you think, Pearl?
- Parry!

08:01.630 --> 08:04.364
<i>- Brother!
- Just wait a minute.</i>

08:04.366 --> 08:06.266
<i>You're not my real brother!</i>

08:06.268 --> 08:08.435
Aah!
Boomerang blade!

08:09.672 --> 08:13.307
<i>Your technique is impressive.
But it won't be enough.</i>

08:13.309 --> 08:16.343
<i>It's about waiting carefully
for the perfect moment to ...</i>

08:17.440 --> 08:19.813
<i>- Thrust!
The TV!</i>

08:19.815 --> 08:22.483
Why must you destroy the things I love?!

08:22.485 --> 08:24.685
<i>Challenger defeated!
Continue?</i>

08:24.687 --> 08:27.154
I hate you!
I hate you!

08:27.156 --> 08:28.655
You're nothing like Pearl!

08:28.657 --> 08:32.458
Pearl is smart, and she always
wants to protect me from danger!

08:32.461 --> 08:34.695
All you want to do is fight me!

08:34.697 --> 08:36.462
<i>Challenge accepted!</i>

08:36.465 --> 08:40.267
All right, fine!

08:40.269 --> 08:42.669

08:42.671 --> 08:45.405

- Don't say that!

08:47.743 --> 08:50.777
<i>Parry! Parry! Thrust!</i>

08:50.779 --> 08:53.413
<i>Basic attack mode defeated!</i>

09:09.265 --> 09:12.833
<i>Snacks, pillow,
fuzzy flower, boomerang?</i>

09:12.835 --> 09:14.434
Boomerang!

09:27.209 --> 09:30.450
Aah! Pearl!

09:30.452 --> 09:33.754
I should have just waited for
you to come back!

09:33.756 --> 09:36.690
I should have waited for...

09:36.692 --> 09:37.824
...the perfect moment!

09:37.826 --> 09:40.260
Boomerang blade!

09:47.403 --> 09:51.238
<i>Challenger wins!
Do you wish to duel again?</i>

09:51.240 --> 09:53.740
N-o-o-o-o-o!

09:55.311 --> 09:57.744
- Steven, we heard fighting.
- Ow!

09:57.746 --> 10:00.681
Are you all right?
What's going on?

10:00.683 --> 10:04.351
Oh, just mopping.
Die!

10:04.353 --> 10:08.322
You know, I might miss Pearl a
whole lot, but sometimes you

10:08.324 --> 10:11.625
just have to accept things the
way they are before you ...

10:19.969 --> 10:21.535
Never mind! Pearl's back!

10:23.739 --> 10:24.938
That's much better.

10:24.940 --> 10:28.909
- Ohh! Hey! Miss me much?
- Oh, man!

10:28.911 --> 10:31.878
I had this whole thing planned
out for when you came back!

10:31.880 --> 10:34.548
Uh, Steven, what
happened to your room?

10:34.550 --> 10:36.817
I don't even want to know what
happened to you.

10:36.819 --> 10:39.920
- I got hit by a airplane!
- Pearl's back!

10:39.922 --> 10:41.355
Pearl's back!

10:41.357 --> 10:43.924
- Steven, what are you doing?
- Pearl's back! Pearl's back!

10:43.926 --> 10:45.559
Pearl's back!

10:45.561 --> 10:47.127
Ugh. I can't leave you
guys alone for a second.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.328
Pearl's back!
