(mellow music playing)

01:00.767 --> 01:01.500
(Blanche sniffs)

01:01.567 --> 01:02.700
Mm.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.567
-Morning.
-Morning.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.834
Dorothy, taste this.

01:10.934 --> 01:13.200
Mmm.
Oh, Ma, that's wonderful.

01:13.266 --> 01:17.133
Yeah, smells fine.
I don't know why they're recalling it.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.066
-Good morning.
-Morning, Rose.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.700
There's something different about you.
Didn't you used to have a neck?

01:31.400 --> 01:34.166
It's tension.
It always goes to the same place.

01:34.667 --> 01:39.166
My shoulders tighten, my neck stiffens,
and I can't turn my head.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.066
-You can't move your neck?
-No.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.000
Look out behind you!

01:46.166 --> 01:48.433
You got to make
your own fun around here.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.967
What's making you so tense?

01:51.033 --> 01:53.700
It's my job, all the pressure.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.867
You're just working
for a consumer reporter.

01:56.934 --> 01:59.100
You're not actually on TV yourself.

01:59.166 --> 02:04.934
All those consumers are depending on me
to do a good job.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.133
If I'm not careful,
people could get hurt or cheated.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.800
Look! It's Jimmy Smits!

02:10.600 --> 02:12.800
(laughs)

02:12.867 --> 02:14.500
Ma, stop that.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.266
(doorbell rings)

02:16.333 --> 02:19.300
Rose, you have to learn
to handle that stress.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.667
You can't walk around in agony.

02:21.734 --> 02:23.533
You know
what you do for a bad neck?

02:23.600 --> 02:27.133
Get into bed, lie still,
and wait until it's over.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.767
Sorry. That's not a bad neck.
That's bad sex.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.166
Hi, mom.

02:37.233 --> 02:39.900
Michael, Michael,
I can't believe it!

02:39.967 --> 02:42.767
Oh, honey, it is
so good to see you!

02:42.834 --> 02:45.300
Everybody, Michael is here!

02:45.367 --> 02:46.934
Look, Rose. It's Michael.

02:47.033 --> 02:51.166
I'm not falling for that again.
Ah, Michael.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.834
Hi, Blanche, Rose.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.300
Oh, grandma,
you look more beautiful than ever.

02:57.367 --> 03:00.367
Relax. You're already in the will.
Give me a hug.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.867
Michael,
I thought you were touring with that band.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.700
Great news, Ma. I quit.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.867
Quit?
You just got the job two weeks ago.

03:09.934 --> 03:12.166
But I feel like I'm in a rut.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.433
How are you going
to support your wife?

03:14.500 --> 03:17.333
More good news.
Lorraine and I separated.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.333
Sep... What do you mean?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.767
He and Lorraine aren't living together.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.600
I know what he means.

03:25.266 --> 03:27.734
We're just giving each other space.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.000
She threw you out?

03:29.066 --> 03:30.667
She changed the locks
and everything.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.900
She tossed all my clothes
out the window.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.433
It's terrible having to search
for your underwear

03:37.500 --> 03:39.600
in the back seat of a convertible.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.834
Tell me about it.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.600
Couldn't you have tried
to make it work

03:48.667 --> 03:50.500
before you walked away?

03:50.567 --> 03:52.433
God knows I tried.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.700
She didn't understand who I am.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.967
I'm a free spirit.

03:57.033 --> 04:00.100
That's why I like to come home
because you understand me.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.900
It's not just because
I do your laundry?

04:03.533 --> 04:06.633
Michael,
will you join us for breakfast?

04:06.700 --> 04:09.266
That's the best offer
I've had all morning.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.367
You should back up
your kid a little more.

04:13.433 --> 04:19.133
It's just that I hate to see Michael
making all the wrong choices.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.100
My children made all the right choices.

04:22.166 --> 04:25.400
My son was a cross-dresser.
My daughter was unmarried and pregnant.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.367
Hell, I was the Rose Kennedy of Brooklyn.

04:31.300 --> 04:35.266
(nostalgic music playing)

04:45.233 --> 04:48.800
Rose!
Honey, it's 3:00 in the morning!

04:48.867 --> 04:50.834
Why are you staring
at those light bulbs?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.800
I'm running a consumer test for work.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.567
I have to see
which one of these lasts longer.

04:58.100 --> 05:02.934
Rose, staring at light bulbs for hours
is bad for your eyes.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.066
Don't worry about my eyes.

05:05.133 --> 05:09.033
I'd be more concerned with those
purple spots all over your face.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.500
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche. I'm frazzled.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.133
Not only is this due tomorrow,

05:15.200 --> 05:18.867
but I have to make sure
this watch really is waterproof.

05:20.567 --> 05:24.333
Honey, why don't you take
the watch off your wrist?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.967
Then I'd have my hand
in a bucket of water for nothing.

05:32.066 --> 05:35.567
Rose, listen.
Don't take this the wrong way,

05:35.633 --> 05:37.400
but you are driving us all crazy.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.367
You've got to get some sleep.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.166
How? There's no way I can relax

05:42.233 --> 05:44.400
when I'm so anxious about these
work deadlines.

05:44.467 --> 05:45.633
Learn to relax.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.600
I learned how to relax
on that meditation retreat.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.000
You went on a meditation retreat?
Was it successful?

05:53.066 --> 05:54.734
Oh, yes! By the end of the week,

05:54.800 --> 05:58.100
17 men were using my name
as a mantra.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.233
Ok. How do you meditate?

06:01.300 --> 06:04.300
Well, just shut your eyes.
Now breathe deeply.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.467
Uh-huh.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.867
Mm-hmm.

06:10.934 --> 06:12.400
Good.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.600
Oh, I can't. I'm too wound up.

06:14.667 --> 06:18.066
Blanche! Which one went out first?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.367
Beats me.
(scoffs)

06:25.033 --> 06:28.133
Now what will I tell
Enrique Mas tomorrow?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.533
Tell him you're overworked.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.033
He'll think I can't do the job.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.033
You can't do it, Rose.
Not like this.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.800
Tell him you have too much to do.

06:38.867 --> 06:42.166
It may mean your job,
but you can't go on like this.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.433
You'll die, or we'll kill you.

06:46.200 --> 06:50.967
I'll think about it, but I'm not ready
to give up the most challenging,

06:51.033 --> 06:53.200
exciting job I've ever had.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.700
(calm music playing)

07:06.166 --> 07:07.767
Ma, listen to this.

07:07.834 --> 07:11.633
"Saxophonist wanted at the Hacienda Hut.
Cocktail Lounge."

07:11.700 --> 07:13.066
What do you think?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.333
I guess I could learn.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.900
Ma, not for you. For Michael.

07:20.967 --> 07:25.567
For the past week,
he's been going to the beach.

07:25.633 --> 07:29.100
Maybe this job will get him
on the right track again.

07:29.166 --> 07:32.633
You don't want Michael
working in a place like that.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.667
It's full of people looking for easy sex
and cheap thrills...

07:37.834 --> 07:41.567
but if it will help, I could write
a letter of recommendation.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.266
Why are you pushing
Michael into a job?

07:47.333 --> 07:51.133
-Let him find himself.
-Oh, Ma, I'm a little concerned.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.467
He just doesn't take commitment seriously.

07:54.533 --> 07:57.066
Ma, he quits jobs,
he leaves relationships.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.667
It's like they don't matter.

07:58.734 --> 08:01.800
He's 30. When's he going to grow up?

08:01.867 --> 08:04.934
You make it easy for him not to.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.533
It's my fault?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.834
You have to do something,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.500
or you're going to end up
with a 60-year-old kid

08:11.567 --> 08:14.900
who can't hold a job
or have a meaningful relationship,

08:14.967 --> 08:18.433
who runs to you for emotional support.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.233
Can you imagine a man like that?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.734
(doorbell rings)

08:21.800 --> 08:23.500
No, I can't.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.367
Yes, I can.

08:33.233 --> 08:34.367
Hi, it's me, Stan.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.400
Come on in, Stanley.
We were just talking about you.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.233
I felt my ears burning.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.367
Maybe that cheap toupee retains heat.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.333
Why are you here?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Michael and I made plans tonight,

08:50.467 --> 08:53.834
a father-son evening
where we could rap, share feelings,

08:53.900 --> 08:55.767
and create good vibes.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.734
I can dig it.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.867
-Where are you taking him?
-The Hacienda Hut.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.233
I'm giving him quality time

09:06.300 --> 09:08.667
to make up for never teaching him
to ride a bicycle.

09:09.133 --> 09:12.133
I've never seen you there.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.734
I never have to stay long.
I'm a chick magnet.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.100
(laughs)

09:17.166 --> 09:19.500
That's why they call me Mr. Lucky.
(chuckles)

09:19.567 --> 09:23.767
You mean, for 38 years
I was Mrs. Lucky and never knew it?

09:25.133 --> 09:27.400
Uh, what about the present Mrs. Lucky?

09:27.467 --> 09:29.867
Does she know what a maggot you are?

09:32.633 --> 09:35.033
Magnet, Dorothy, magnet.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.934
Dad, I'll be with you in a second.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.700
Ma, could I see you in the kitchen?

09:47.567 --> 09:50.767
I'm picking up the tab for dinner tonight.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.467
I feel bad
because I've never treated you.

09:53.533 --> 09:56.734
I love dad,
but you've always been there for me.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.333
I'll always be there for you.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.834
I'm glad to hear that, Ma,
because I need to borrow $30.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.400
$30? Michael, you're an adult.

10:06.467 --> 10:09.333
Do you really want to beg your mother
for $30?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.133
Fine. Forget it. You know, I hate this.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.000
Whenever I need money,
you make me feel like I'm asking.

10:17.967 --> 10:20.667
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

10:20.734 --> 10:25.700
-All I have are two 20s.
-Great, we can get appetizers.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.367
-Let's jam.
-That's my boy.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.900
-That's my dad.
-That's my money.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.633
Dorothy, you gave him money again?

10:39.700 --> 10:44.533
Oh, you'll never have a good relationship
with your children

10:44.600 --> 10:48.433
until you stop doing all the things
they should be doing for themselves.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.200
Dorothy, I finished your blouse.

10:50.266 --> 10:52.834
-And the socks?
-Get right on it.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.133
What should I do?

10:56.200 --> 11:00.000
Make him stand on his own feet.
Kick him out.

11:00.467 --> 11:03.000
-You really think I should?
-Kick him out.

11:03.066 --> 11:04.900
I know it sounds hard and cruel, Dorothy,

11:04.967 --> 11:07.533
but I've been reading
about that very thing.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
It's called "rough love."

11:11.066 --> 11:13.333
No, I think it's "tough love."

11:13.400 --> 11:17.400
See? We've both come up
with something we ought to try.

11:21.433 --> 11:24.467
(calm music playing)

11:27.934 --> 11:30.367
-Michael?
-Why are you up?

11:30.433 --> 11:31.700
Waiting up for you.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.667
-I brought you something.
-Change for my 40?

11:35.633 --> 11:38.000
No, these little bamboo umbrellas.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.700
These are mine to keep, right?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.600
I stayed up
because I want to talk to you.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.133
How's the job hunt?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.033
There's not too much
out there right now.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.633
You're sending out resumes?

11:52.700 --> 11:55.533
Come on, Ma.
Musicians don't send out resumes.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.500
It's not like a "job" job.

11:57.567 --> 12:01.200
A "job" job is when you go
to work regularly,

12:01.266 --> 12:04.000
bring home a paycheck,
and support yourself.

12:04.066 --> 12:06.934
Ok, wait a minute. What's this all about?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.033
You're 30 years old.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.800
I want you to find your own place,
cook your own food,

12:12.867 --> 12:15.700
and take responsibility for your life.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.700
But, Ma, that takes money.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.467
That's where the "job" job comes in.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.533
So you're kicking me out?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.567
No. I'm forcing you to grow up.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.867
Fine. I'll pack my things.

12:29.934 --> 12:35.033
Since I sprung this out of the blue,
you can stay another week.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.633
What, and put off growing up?
Nah.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.633
I'm out of here.

12:41.500 --> 12:45.367
(gloomy music plays)

12:46.233 --> 12:50.133
(serene music playing)

12:50.200 --> 12:52.934
(rain pattering sound over radio)

12:56.800 --> 12:59.166
Rose, what the hell are you listening to?

12:59.233 --> 13:00.934
It's a relaxation tape.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.567
The rain's supposed to relax me.

13:02.633 --> 13:05.266
-Is it working?
-(sighs) Not really.

13:05.333 --> 13:08.400
I keep worrying
that I left my car windows down.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.600
(sound stops)

13:12.533 --> 13:16.800
I feel so helpless.
I get upset every time I think about it.

13:16.867 --> 13:19.000
Now, look, Rose, stop whining.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.500
You'll have to speak to your boss
about your work load.

13:22.567 --> 13:25.467
Wallowing in self-pity
isn't going to help.

13:25.533 --> 13:28.700
-How are you feeling, Dorothy?
-My life is falling apart,

13:28.767 --> 13:31.767
(sobs)
and now Rose is bothering me!

13:35.166 --> 13:37.200
Dorothy, I'm sorry I bothered you.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.266
I'm sorry I snapped at you, Rose.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.233
It's just that I'm upset.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.900
Because you threw Michael out?

13:43.967 --> 13:45.800
No. It's because I can't make any sense

13:45.867 --> 13:48.700
out of those commercials
for obsession.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.133
Of course it's because of Michael.

13:58.834 --> 14:01.533
You just did what you had to.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.633
Blanche, knowing that doesn't help.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.100
I am going crazy
wondering where he is.

14:06.166 --> 14:12.166
He could be sleeping under a pier
or out on the street.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.900
Michael called.
He's staying with Stan.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.800
(sobs)
Oh, God, it's even worse than I thought!

14:18.133 --> 14:20.266
He can depend on one of his parents.

14:20.333 --> 14:24.000
-I told you why--
-I know, but you're wrong.

14:24.066 --> 14:28.200
Your brother Phil is older than Michael,
and I still send him money.

14:28.266 --> 14:31.300
You should never turn
your back on family.

14:31.367 --> 14:32.533
I know.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.967
When your crazy cousin Nunzio
started living with his pet goat,

14:36.033 --> 14:37.667
did the family turn its back on him?

14:38.166 --> 14:42.467
No. And after a couple of nights,
neither did the goat.

14:52.367 --> 14:56.433
Dorothy, this really isn't your problem.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.500
He has to learn the things we need to know
to be an adult.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.700
Like how to earn a living.
How to pay the rent.

15:03.767 --> 15:08.166
How to be kind to your
Friday-night mistake on Saturday.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.934
I need to work on that.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.100
Why is it so hard?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.567
The hardest part for me

15:17.633 --> 15:22.600
was explaining the difference
between boys and girls.

15:22.667 --> 15:26.266
I knew the time would come
but I kept putting it off.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.667
Finally I decided
to take the bull by the horns.

15:29.734 --> 15:30.734
You told her?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.266
No, I took the bull by the horns,

15:33.333 --> 15:37.100
turned him around and showed
her what makes a bull a bull.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.400
You are kidding.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.633
No. That's how my mother taught me.

15:45.333 --> 15:51.000
Didn't that give you a false impression
about what a man would look like?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.300
It sure did.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.000
Can you imagine my surprise?

15:57.066 --> 15:59.834
(all laugh)

15:59.900 --> 16:02.667
Boy that bull would have been jealous.

16:12.867 --> 16:15.500
I wish someone could tell me
I did the right thing.

16:15.567 --> 16:19.367
Yeah, you did. Rose, tell me more.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.367
Not now.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.900
Dorothy,
I know you've done the right thing.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.200
In the animal kingdom,

16:27.266 --> 16:32.033
the whole idea is to teach offspring
to fend for themselves.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.433
Humans are the only ones

16:33.500 --> 16:37.834
who think it's their duty to care
for children their entire lives.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.700
You know,
sometimes you really say wise things.

16:45.066 --> 16:47.734
We're also the only species
who use corn holders

16:47.800 --> 16:50.867
that look like corn.

16:52.567 --> 16:54.800
Oops. Spoke too soon.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.934
(nostalgic music playing)

17:07.433 --> 17:10.033
Aw, Rose,
is your neck bothering you again?

17:10.100 --> 17:12.567
Yeah. I'll do something about it.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.700
You've come to your senses.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.934
(doorbell rings)

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
There's nothing worse
than a pain in the neck.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.200
I must be psychic.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.934
Why are you here?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.500
-Let's go in the kitchen.
-It's private?

17:30.567 --> 17:32.567
I'm hungry. Got any bagels?

17:33.834 --> 17:35.100
Hello, Rose.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.066
Ok, Stanley,
what do you want to talk about?

17:42.133 --> 17:44.000
-About Michael.
-What happened?

17:44.066 --> 17:46.200
Why are there so many cheesecakes?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.934
What about Michael?

17:48.033 --> 17:50.934
He's fine. He's living the life of Riley.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.800
I cook his meals.
I change his sheets. I pay his bills.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.633
(sobs)
He's making my life miserable, Dorothy.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.033
Stanley, pull yourself together.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.033
It's not just the disruption to my life.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.000
It's seeing him do nothing with his.

18:05.066 --> 18:08.300
You took him in. Now it's your problem.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.367
You have to deal with it.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.967
I have to do
the hardest thing in the world.

18:14.033 --> 18:16.567
You're going to ask Michael to leave.

18:16.633 --> 18:20.500
No, I'm going to ask you
to ask Michael to leave.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.867
He already resents you.
Why should he be mad at me, too?

18:25.433 --> 18:27.033
That's enough. Get out.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.567
See?
You're great at throwing people out.

18:29.633 --> 18:33.900
You'll have to throw your own son
out of your own house.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.500
I can't.

18:35.567 --> 18:38.967
How can I judge
how Michael lives his life?

18:39.033 --> 18:41.900
I'm a middle-aged man
selling novelties for a living.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.400
Things could've been different
if I applied myself 30 years ago.

18:46.467 --> 18:50.266
Yeah, you could've invented plastic vomit
instead of just selling it.

18:51.467 --> 18:56.033
Michael's got real talent.
I don't want to see him waste it.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.100
-Then help him, Stanley.
-How?

18:58.166 --> 19:02.800
Set an example.
Show him it's never too late to grow up.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.467
You're right.

19:06.567 --> 19:10.533
It is time for me to show some maturity.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.066
I'm going to be strong, Dorothy.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.700
Not just for Michael, but for myself.

19:15.767 --> 19:19.633
This is a side of you I rarely see,

19:19.700 --> 19:22.367
and I must say it's very attractive.

19:22.433 --> 19:23.734
Really?

19:24.300 --> 19:26.166
You want to fool around?

19:27.834 --> 19:31.166
Oh, yeah. More than... anything.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.600
What is that, sarcasm?

19:38.633 --> 19:39.433
I'm leaving.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.867
(mellow music playing)

19:47.233 --> 19:50.400
-More around the eyes.
-I'm blending.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.266
I want my public to trust me.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.300
Enrique Mas must have honest eyes.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.700
Try number 34.
Ted Koppel uses 34 around the eyes.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.166
-(Rose) Enrique.
-Rose.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.633
-Do my eyes look honest enough?
-I, uh...

20:06.700 --> 20:08.667
See? The lady hesitates.
More around the eyes.

20:08.734 --> 20:11.000
Make me Cronkite.

20:11.734 --> 20:16.900
Enrique, since I've been working here,
I can't move my head anymore.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.166
My back hurts. I can't sleep.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.233
I have trouble digesting food.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.500
I see spots before my eyes.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.967
I'm not a doctor,
but I think I could be stressed.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.967
This sounds important.
Let's discuss this over coffee.

20:31.433 --> 20:34.033
-Cream and sugar?
-And a treat. Surprise me.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.934
See, that's part of it.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.200
I can't possibly handle
all the things you give me to do.

20:41.266 --> 20:43.266
Oh, I feel like such a failure.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.400
You've trusted me
with a really important job,

20:46.467 --> 20:48.967
and I'm just not doing it.

20:49.033 --> 20:52.700
I know your job's hard,
and you're good at it.

20:52.767 --> 20:55.200
Until you started working for me,
my neck was like that.

20:55.867 --> 20:57.867
No wonder I'm cracking.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.734
I don't want you to crack, Rose.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.600
I need you. Do you believe that?

21:05.400 --> 21:08.133
-Yes.
-Enough 34.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.033
Speaking from the heart,
not from the make-up,

21:13.100 --> 21:14.266
you're the best.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.400
That's why I work you hard,
out of respect.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.800
Thank you.

21:18.867 --> 21:22.200
I don't want to kill you.
I'll hire an assistant.

21:22.266 --> 21:24.533
An assistant? For me?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.000
I can't believe it.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.100
You can't? It must be fading.

21:29.467 --> 21:30.800
More 34.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.700
Rose, first thing tomorrow,
you'll get your assistant.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.633
(cheerful music playing)

21:39.166 --> 21:40.934
(doorbell rings)

21:47.600 --> 21:51.633
Dad asked me to leave.
He said he agreed with you.

21:51.700 --> 21:55.100
(scoffs) You two never agreed
about anything before.

21:55.166 --> 21:58.033
We both agree that we love you.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.867
You have a funny way of showing it.

21:59.934 --> 22:02.900
Because of this I had
to beg for my job back.

22:02.967 --> 22:05.667
You got it? That's wonderful.

22:05.734 --> 22:08.600
-Wonderful? It's humiliating.
-Oh, Michael.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.533
I got to catch a bus.
You got my laundry?

22:13.467 --> 22:17.633
Michael,
I think what your mother did was right.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.800
You may not see it now,
but you'll realize it later.

22:27.133 --> 22:29.300
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.100
I came around to your side.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.967
You gave him money.

22:40.033 --> 22:43.200
It's not my money.
I took it from your purse.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.000
I don't know if he'll ever forgive me.

22:48.066 --> 22:51.633
The day you left me at Shady Pines,
remember what I told you?

22:51.700 --> 22:54.100
That you'd never forgive me.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.100
Look at us. Everything's fine.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.834
You're saying no matter
how bad things are

22:58.900 --> 23:01.100
between Michael and me,
they'll change?

23:01.166 --> 23:04.200
I'm saying that when Michael is 83

23:04.266 --> 23:07.400
and his retirement home burns down,
you're...

23:08.533 --> 23:11.834
Oh, that's right. You'll be dead.

23:13.734 --> 23:15.500
See you, pussycat.

23:23.500 --> 23:27.834
(theme music playing)
