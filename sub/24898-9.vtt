00:15.358 --> 00:17.530
Wow. They made it look just like a camp.

00:17.565 --> 00:20.569
Bro, it is a camp.
It's just for adults and families.

00:21.164 --> 00:22.844
Real camp, not a facsimile.

00:23.287 --> 00:25.610
Welcome to Camp Wenebosho!

00:25.773 --> 00:27.365
So, we are that way.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.896
Our cabin is Wendigo.

00:30.278 --> 00:32.185
Hang on, hang on. Hey, hand it over!

00:32.811 --> 00:36.489
We all agreed!
No phones, no devices, no tablets.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.284
I thought we were doing
a thing where we say.

00:38.319 --> 00:39.595
"Yeah, great idea"

00:39.620 --> 00:42.264
and then, don't do it 'cause
it's a terrible idea.

00:42.624 --> 00:43.960
People need to reach us.

00:44.048 --> 00:45.758
You have 72 hours off work.

00:45.953 --> 00:47.560
You're 90 minutes from home.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.242
Unplug and unwind, baby.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.153
Dave's right. Just the three of us.

00:52.178 --> 00:53.942
When are we ever gonna
get that chance again?

00:54.063 --> 00:55.364
Well, you and I work together,

00:55.389 --> 00:58.464
and Dave has taken to parking his
coffee truck at crime scenes.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.105
I'd say this chance could
come as soon as Monday.

01:01.336 --> 01:04.333
Come on, disconnect to reconnect.

01:04.529 --> 01:06.183
I set this up so we'd have one weekend

01:06.208 --> 01:07.943
that doesn't involve dead people,

01:08.039 --> 01:09.943
chasing that people that
make the dead people,

01:09.968 --> 01:11.568
or preventing people from becoming dead.

01:11.678 --> 01:12.725
Deal?

01:14.133 --> 01:15.225
Deal.

01:16.942 --> 01:18.005
Deal.

01:18.927 --> 01:19.950
Thank you.

01:21.091 --> 01:22.851
This is gonna be just
like when we were kids!

01:22.981 --> 01:24.020
Dibs on bottom bunk!

01:24.508 --> 01:26.376
Whoa, whoa, it's bunk beds?

01:34.683 --> 01:37.049
Okay, well, not glamping.

01:37.074 --> 01:39.222
But clean, and... pioneer-ish.

01:39.310 --> 01:40.389
Yeah.

01:41.507 --> 01:43.762
- Welcome to Camp Wenebosho!
- Tom!

01:45.352 --> 01:47.687
Tom, these are my friends.
This is Sam and Harley.

01:47.721 --> 01:49.216
- Sam, Harley, hey.
- Hi.

01:49.241 --> 01:50.499
You guys settling in okay?

01:50.524 --> 01:51.658
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:51.692 --> 01:54.102
- Hey, the renovations look amazing!
- Thank you, thank you.

01:54.127 --> 01:56.171
You know, we haven't quite
got to the cabins yet.

01:56.196 --> 01:57.742
That septic work cost a bundle.

01:58.469 --> 01:59.788
It's been a real journey, all right.

01:59.812 --> 02:02.705
- But then again, the journey...
- Is the destination, I remember.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.327
You!

02:04.921 --> 02:06.982
Hey, I didn't see a
lot of people around.

02:07.241 --> 02:09.001
- Are we it for the weekend?
- No, no.

02:09.026 --> 02:10.650
Most of guests show up on Saturday,

02:10.675 --> 02:13.453
and then, they stay till after
the talent show on Sunday night.

02:13.478 --> 02:14.804
- Yeah.
- I hope you're going to favour

02:14.828 --> 02:15.881
us with a song this year?

02:15.906 --> 02:18.108
- I don't know.
- Come on! Come on.

02:18.194 --> 02:21.210
Hey, Dave brought his ukulele
a couple of years back

02:21.399 --> 02:23.700
and he tore through a version of
"Smells Like Teen Spirit"

02:23.725 --> 02:25.453
that had the whole place going crazy.

02:25.573 --> 02:27.344
Well, aren't you full of surprises.

02:27.506 --> 02:30.026
- I'm kind of amazing.
- Nothing drives the ladies crazier

02:30.051 --> 02:32.135
than Dave whipping out his ukulele.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.798
Okay, a little disturbed
by your phrasing on that.

02:34.823 --> 02:36.724
As you can see,
my friends are kind of jerks.

02:36.749 --> 02:37.918
Some of them, not all of them.

02:37.942 --> 02:39.554
Well, I'm sure they grow on you.

02:39.874 --> 02:41.546
Listen, I got to get back to the office,

02:41.552 --> 02:43.962
but I'll catch up with you folks
at the campfire tonight, okay?

02:43.986 --> 02:46.995
- Yeah.
- So glad you're here!

02:47.190 --> 02:49.321
All right, all right, have fun.
I'll see you in a bit!

02:49.346 --> 02:50.404
All right.

02:51.108 --> 02:53.025
So, are we jumping in
that lake, or what?

02:53.050 --> 02:54.354
Yes... but first!

02:54.379 --> 02:57.816
Before I forget,
I have something for you, Harley.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.215
I hope you don't think
this is a bathing suit.

03:03.476 --> 03:06.811
This is a snoring chinstrap.

03:06.836 --> 03:09.076
You wear it on your face.

03:10.905 --> 03:12.833
Okay, two things.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.185
One, I don't wear face underwear,
especially your face underwear.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.669
And two, I don't snore!

03:19.147 --> 03:21.030
- Do too.
- Don't.

03:21.345 --> 03:22.479
- Do too.
- Don't.

03:22.504 --> 03:23.606
Do too. Snorers say don't!

03:23.631 --> 03:25.091
Yes!

03:25.116 --> 03:29.163
You're right. This is going to be
exactly like when we were kids.

03:31.562 --> 03:33.163
My bunk!!

03:33.414 --> 03:34.453
Like this?

03:49.917 --> 03:52.125
Feet of flame! Feet of fire!

03:52.190 --> 03:53.490
Go, go!

03:53.751 --> 03:56.419
Go, Dave! Yeah!

04:02.590 --> 04:03.631
Whoa!

04:10.561 --> 04:14.213
Okay, I have a vague memory of
Dave riverdancing last night.

04:14.238 --> 04:16.343
Did that happen? Because
that was on my bucket list.

04:16.565 --> 04:17.591
It happened.

04:17.809 --> 04:21.349
And then, it kept happening
for almost three hours.

04:21.543 --> 04:23.472
Great, well, I can die happy now.

04:24.066 --> 04:26.572
In fact, right now, I
just feel like dying.

04:26.597 --> 04:28.178
Yeah, I think that, um...

04:28.417 --> 04:31.114
Jack Daniels slushies were
maybe the bridge too far.

04:31.357 --> 04:35.439
I think the Jack Daniels
washed out the bridges too far.

04:36.642 --> 04:38.721
Good morning, campers!

04:39.588 --> 04:41.493
The dawn has graced us,

04:41.610 --> 04:44.290
and the wonders of Camp Wenebosho await.

04:44.462 --> 04:46.251
What are we up for today?

04:46.564 --> 04:48.783
We have paddle-boarding.

04:48.961 --> 04:51.518
Canoeing. Ooh, archery!

04:52.072 --> 04:54.021
I'm pretty good with a bow, actually.

04:54.232 --> 04:57.217
Let's just do whatever
activity is the quietest,

04:57.279 --> 04:59.075
and involves the least
amount of movement.

04:59.109 --> 05:01.124
And is the quietest.

05:01.874 --> 05:04.382
- That would be rock painting.
- Great.

05:04.782 --> 05:07.511
I cannot tell you guys how many
times I've thought to myself,

05:07.536 --> 05:09.402
"Gee, I wish I had more
time for rock painting."

05:09.426 --> 05:12.894
- You guys are lame.
- Help! We need help.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.018
It's awful! Do you have a phone?

05:16.140 --> 05:18.659
There's one in the rec hall.
Are you guys okay?

05:18.917 --> 05:20.666
- No, um...
- They probably just saw a bear.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.728
- Yeah.
- You might...

05:38.264 --> 05:39.984
I suppose you want your phone back.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.987
Scavengers have been
picking at it for so long,

06:09.139 --> 06:11.157
it's going to be tough to
get a read on what happened.

06:11.181 --> 06:12.919
Nothing screams foul play at me, though.

06:12.944 --> 06:15.151
- I'll have more for you in a bit.
- All right, thanks, Nic.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.278
Do you have a ballpark on the TOD?

06:17.477 --> 06:19.762
Well, based on the level
of decomp and predation,

06:20.051 --> 06:22.848
I think our snowmobiler died
maybe about 8 to 10 months ago,

06:22.883 --> 06:23.926
sometime in the winter.

06:24.043 --> 06:25.559
Is it science that tells you that,

06:25.584 --> 06:27.239
or the fact that he was on a snowmobile?

06:30.350 --> 06:31.537
Morning, Chief.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.210
So, we haven't ID'd the victim yet,

06:34.235 --> 06:36.238
but it's just looking like
a snowmobile accident.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.809
All right, thanks, Sam, I got this.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.227
Okay, 'cause I was I was
going to have Rafalski

06:39.251 --> 06:40.696
run through some missing
persons reports.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.738
He's already on it.

06:41.763 --> 06:43.553
Look, Sam, it's probably an accident,
like you said.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.657
There's no need to involve
another detective in this.

06:45.684 --> 06:47.834
Okay, are you sure you can...

06:47.900 --> 06:48.912
Handle it?

06:49.381 --> 06:51.494
I was a detective long
before you had the job.

06:51.599 --> 06:52.740
Before you had any job.

06:52.942 --> 06:54.646
Off you go, all of you,
it's your weekend.

06:54.678 --> 06:58.478
Kick back, relax, stop
working at my scene.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.024
- That's an order, Sam.
- Okay.

07:01.049 --> 07:02.516
Nicole, I'll need an update.

07:03.101 --> 07:04.443
I'll just get my bag.

07:05.436 --> 07:06.466
Bye, Chief.

07:14.651 --> 07:17.195
Yeah, but a snowmobiler
gone missing in the winter,

07:17.220 --> 07:18.667
that would have resulted in a search.

07:18.691 --> 07:21.240
Yeah, but how could a snowmobiler
be murdered in secret?

07:21.571 --> 07:22.863
Maybe he had a heart attack.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.473
Or-or-or maybe somebody
put poison in his gloves,

07:25.498 --> 07:26.956
and then, when he started to sweat...

07:26.980 --> 07:29.838
Guys, stop being compulsive
mystery solvers.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.799
There's no mystery to find
here, bloodhounds. Move on.

07:33.530 --> 07:34.533
Sam, you're up.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.349
Sorry.

07:37.627 --> 07:41.573
What if he was impaled
on the branch of a tree

07:41.615 --> 07:43.783
but then, the scavengers
destroyed the evidence?

07:43.808 --> 07:45.417
Don't make me stage an intervention.

07:45.538 --> 07:47.780
Because I can guarantee you
it will be poorly planned

07:47.858 --> 07:49.292
and completely unhelpful.

07:49.317 --> 07:51.840
- Throw your dart.
- Okay, here we go.

07:56.090 --> 07:57.557
No, it's not on.

07:57.864 --> 07:58.884
Anything yet?

07:59.248 --> 08:03.346
Found this very
close to the remains.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.624
Could have been his,
could have been used against him.

08:06.015 --> 08:07.640
Cause of death will determine that,

08:07.746 --> 08:09.513
meanwhile, we'll analyze it at the lab.

08:09.923 --> 08:14.334
Now, here's a piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance
you don't see every day.

08:16.778 --> 08:17.965
A hidden compartment.

08:18.591 --> 08:21.981
Kind of thing used in cars
to smuggle illegal drugs across borders.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.436
Never saw one in a snowmobile, though.

08:24.493 --> 08:26.213
You think we stumbled
on a contraband route?

08:26.246 --> 08:28.699
No contraband here,
unless there's an underground market

08:28.724 --> 08:30.565
for dead cell phones I don't know about.

08:30.975 --> 08:32.456
I found this inside.

08:32.942 --> 08:34.057
Can you get it going again?

08:34.315 --> 08:35.955
Odds are good we can
get something off it.

08:36.138 --> 08:38.629
Now, between the gun and the
secret compartment,

08:39.136 --> 08:40.543
I'm thinking our snowmobiler

08:40.568 --> 08:42.947
didn't just have an accident
while out joy-riding.

08:45.073 --> 08:46.374
Maybe it was a vendetta.

08:46.619 --> 08:47.680
Or a turf war.

08:48.118 --> 08:51.030
A snowmobiler turf war?
That's the best you got?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.041
Please, can we talk
about something else?

08:53.173 --> 08:56.130
Sorry. You are totally right.
What do you want to talk about?

08:56.326 --> 08:58.046
Spiderman. The new Spiderman movie!

08:58.223 --> 09:00.067
- There's a new one?
- Isn't there always?

09:00.091 --> 09:02.034
Creek's dried out.
You can't launch from there.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.180
Great! So, now I'm
just walking around

09:04.204 --> 09:05.445
with a boat on my head.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.655
I knew I should have picked archery.

09:10.386 --> 09:11.971
You good, Dave? You need any help?

09:12.064 --> 09:15.589
Don't. Even. Try. You'll make it worse.

09:16.647 --> 09:18.835
You finish that up,
and then I'll see you by the water.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.750
Folks finding everything okay?

09:21.775 --> 09:24.052
Tom, it's great. Thank you so much.

09:24.077 --> 09:25.439
Yeah, really good. Thank you.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.361
No, thank you, thank you all

09:27.548 --> 09:30.890
for keeping the police presence
next door so low-profile.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.671
Of course. It helps them do
their investigation, too.

09:33.808 --> 09:36.295
We've just been so busy
with the reopening,

09:36.320 --> 09:38.037
and it's already so late in the summer.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.170
I'm afraid it's gonna
really ruin our bookings

09:40.195 --> 09:41.470
if everybody starts to hear.

09:41.495 --> 09:42.895
You've done a great job, bud.

09:43.055 --> 09:45.190
Waterfront looks amazing.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.553
I love this new music corner.
It's great.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.654
Yes, thank you.

09:48.884 --> 09:50.188
How do you two know each other?

09:52.852 --> 09:54.315
- Um...
- Dave and I did some work

09:54.340 --> 09:56.323
- together a few years back.
- Right.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.703
Okay!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.437
I better get back to it.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.756
Let me know if you need anything.

10:03.780 --> 10:04.894
- Thanks.
- Okay.

10:08.209 --> 10:10.075
You know what? I'm gonna catch
up with you guys in a bit.

10:10.099 --> 10:11.117
Okay.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.031
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:16.071 --> 10:19.188
Thanks for not saying anything.

10:20.172 --> 10:22.692
Harley and Sam don't really know
much from that time of my life.

10:22.803 --> 10:24.623
And I suppose you want
to keep it that way.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.552
- Exactly.
- Okay...

10:26.689 --> 10:29.811
but when we let our loved
ones in on our secrets,

10:29.836 --> 10:31.771
our secrets lose their power over us.

10:32.061 --> 10:33.904
- You know that, right?
- You're right.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.928
And you still got that
Yoda thing goin' on?

10:43.750 --> 10:44.830
Excuse me.

10:44.908 --> 10:46.190
Do you know where the hospital is?

10:46.214 --> 10:48.209
It's about 20 minutes west of here.
What happened?

10:48.233 --> 10:50.825
I'm just an idiot. I dropped
my glass on the patio

10:50.850 --> 10:53.154
- and cut myself picking up the shards.
- It's bleeding a lot.

10:53.178 --> 10:54.559
I'm not sure if he needs stitches.

10:54.584 --> 10:56.014
Why don't you see if they
have a first-aid kit?

10:56.038 --> 10:58.446
I'm trained in first-aid,
so let me see how bad it is.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.209
- Are you sure?
- That's so kind of you.

11:00.233 --> 11:01.735
Yeah, yeah, have a seat here.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.137
Okay.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.051
- Wait, aren't you...?
- Harley Carter, yeah.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.901
Good, I thought I was
hallucinating from blood loss.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.971
I'm Greg Karmazin. I'd
shake your hand, but...

11:15.235 --> 11:16.678
There we go. Boop!

11:16.703 --> 11:18.897
This is my wife, Jenna.

11:18.921 --> 11:19.921
Hi.

11:20.926 --> 11:22.486
Wow, you really know what you're doing.

11:22.971 --> 11:25.500
- Are you a nurse?
- No, a police officer.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.078
I heard that Harley Carter

11:27.103 --> 11:29.383
was doing some detective
stuff in this area.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.276
Are you guys are here, like...

11:31.691 --> 11:32.884
undercover?

11:33.150 --> 11:35.290
No, no, we're just hanging out.

11:35.315 --> 11:36.548
Right.

11:36.907 --> 11:39.470
This looks like a pretty clean cut,

11:40.595 --> 11:42.602
it's superficial.

11:43.728 --> 11:45.723
So, if the bleeding doesn't stop,

11:45.748 --> 11:47.845
then I would definitely
have somebody look at it.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.174
What cabin are you guys in?

11:49.199 --> 11:50.329
You want to grab a drink later?

11:50.353 --> 11:52.127
Not if you're bartending, bro.

11:52.152 --> 11:53.719
Yeah, go easy, Greg.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.534
Hey.

12:01.559 --> 12:05.366
Weapon found near the
body was a Sig Sauer 225.

12:05.708 --> 12:06.997
Discharged one round.

12:07.022 --> 12:08.450
So, it's a possible murder weapon.

12:08.556 --> 12:10.624
There were no casings
found near the body site.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.858
Where's Nicole with the cause of death?

12:13.009 --> 12:16.087
She's still working on it.
Up to her elbows in snowmobiler.

12:16.962 --> 12:18.704
Now that's a calling
I'll never understand.

12:18.776 --> 12:20.015
You and me both.

12:20.119 --> 12:22.586
Speaking of calling,
there's something you need to see.

12:22.844 --> 12:26.111
A printout of the text messages
from the cell phone we found.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.498
Sorry to interrupt your fun and games.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.420
- Hey!
- What the hell are those?

12:35.539 --> 12:37.863
These are water bikes.
Because why just go in the water,

12:37.896 --> 12:39.543
when you can look like
an idiot on top of it?

12:39.567 --> 12:41.575
Hey, Chief, we have an extra
bathing suit up at the cabin

12:41.599 --> 12:42.733
if you'd like to join us.

12:42.786 --> 12:44.253
Yeah, another time.

12:44.804 --> 12:47.238
We ID'd our victim.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.353
I have some important questions,

12:49.796 --> 12:53.228
like why your friend Dave Leigh here

12:53.253 --> 12:55.455
was the last person to send him a text.

13:09.014 --> 13:11.416
It'll take a little while to
determine the cause of death.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.875
In the meantime, can
you identify this man?

13:14.795 --> 13:16.031
Yeah, it's Phil Delorme.

13:16.434 --> 13:17.794
But I think you already know that.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.053
And your last text to him said,

13:21.139 --> 13:23.123
"Don't do anything stupid."
What does that mean?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.929
What it sounds like.

13:25.201 --> 13:26.264
I was cautioning him.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.164
Against what?

13:29.618 --> 13:32.551
Look, you want to make this official,
haul me downtown?

13:32.777 --> 13:34.418
It wouldn't be the first time.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.127
Let's keep it semi-friendly,

13:39.025 --> 13:41.486
- for the moment.
- "For the moment"?

13:41.945 --> 13:43.545
That really helps the semi-friendliness.

13:44.097 --> 13:45.578
So, what was Phil involved with?

13:46.542 --> 13:47.858
Phil was a bag man.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.421
He would take money from one location,

13:50.747 --> 13:52.747
usually somewhere remote
with no surveillance,

13:52.891 --> 13:55.093
to another location, like a casino,

13:55.294 --> 13:56.694
where they would launder the money.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.569
And how do you know all this?

13:58.674 --> 13:59.974
Objection!

14:00.023 --> 14:01.576
You don't have to answer that, buddy.

14:03.211 --> 14:04.386
You should answer it.

14:06.689 --> 14:07.690
I just know.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.212
You were a bag man?

14:09.237 --> 14:10.881
Look, this is ancient history.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.276
Give me a history lesson.

14:12.681 --> 14:14.212
How did the money get from A to B?

14:14.544 --> 14:16.550
Um, if you were a bag man,

14:16.575 --> 14:18.661
now is about the time
you want to lawyer up.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.305
Would you get him out of here, please?

14:20.664 --> 14:22.610
All right, but if he pulls out
a phone book, you just holler.

14:22.634 --> 14:24.234
Okay? We'll be watching.

14:24.456 --> 14:27.449
Just play nice, you will be fine.
I guarantee it.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.755
What are you doing?
We were just getting somewhere.

14:34.779 --> 14:36.578
The Chief will get a lot
further without your help.

14:36.602 --> 14:39.237
- I'm trying to help Dave.
- He's an adult.

14:39.271 --> 14:41.005
We both know he had some rough years.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.473
Yeah, but I thought we were talking

14:42.508 --> 14:44.142
ill-advised piercings and stuff.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.444
A little rougher than that, Harley.

14:46.876 --> 14:50.118
Hey, when the Chief mentioned
Dave's run-ins with the law,

14:50.143 --> 14:51.515
he looked at you. Why?

14:53.519 --> 14:55.853
I arrested him a bunch of years back.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.813
You did not tell me that.

14:57.838 --> 14:59.807
Well, I wasn't sure that
it was my story to tell.

15:00.213 --> 15:02.494
All right, well, Dave doesn't
seem to be holding a grudge.

15:02.749 --> 15:05.430
Well, actually,
we didn't talk for a very long time.

15:05.464 --> 15:09.170
And it was pretty frosty
until you came home.

15:09.411 --> 15:10.873
What did you arrest him for?

15:10.990 --> 15:13.318
Just being drunk and
causing a disturbance.

15:13.553 --> 15:15.896
Disturb... you arrested
him for a disturbance?

15:15.921 --> 15:16.991
Sam, come on!

15:17.016 --> 15:18.641
Why didn't you just let
him off with a warning?

15:18.665 --> 15:20.611
Well, what do you think
arresting him was?

15:20.936 --> 15:22.513
I looked the other way too many times.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.964
Anyway, where the hell were you
when all of this was going on?

15:24.988 --> 15:26.447
Dave's best friend?

15:26.675 --> 15:29.293
Let me remind you we're here
to solve your friend's death,

15:29.421 --> 15:30.746
possibly murder.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.207
So, explain to me again,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.699
what does "Don't do
anything stupid" mean?

15:35.961 --> 15:37.115
Phil was paranoid.

15:37.784 --> 15:41.006
He kept saying he thought the
cops were closing in on him,

15:41.031 --> 15:42.892
and he was going to get swept up in it.

15:43.519 --> 15:45.186
I knew Phil was impulsive.

15:45.447 --> 15:47.345
So, I was just trying to get
him to think things through.

15:47.369 --> 15:48.869
What were you scared he'd do?

15:49.838 --> 15:51.502
Maybe something that
would get him killed.

15:56.861 --> 15:59.922
Look, he was worried he
was gonna lose his chance

15:59.947 --> 16:01.419
to do something good with his life.

16:02.919 --> 16:04.145
But I guess he did.

16:08.326 --> 16:11.229
You seem to know a lot
about the money operation.

16:12.834 --> 16:13.928
So, who ran it?

16:14.453 --> 16:18.196
Honestly, the only name I heard?
Tony Combover.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.672
AKA Antonio Bonaventura.

16:22.516 --> 16:25.430
People who piss him off
live to regret it.

16:25.483 --> 16:26.984
Yeah? I wouldn't know.

16:27.289 --> 16:28.379
I only took part once.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.727
And when you did, how did it work?

16:32.962 --> 16:35.387
There was a hidden compartment
on the snowmobile, okay?

16:35.839 --> 16:37.980
Look, here.

16:39.454 --> 16:40.735
Here's the casino.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.462
Normal route would be to
go all the way around here,

16:43.572 --> 16:44.714
to a hunting cabin here.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.573
Yeah, but Phil's body
was found over here.

16:46.598 --> 16:48.266
This is Crown land,
it's pure wilderness.

16:48.534 --> 16:49.745
So, why the change?

16:50.469 --> 16:52.036
Was he coming from the casino?

16:52.426 --> 16:53.788
How the hell would I know?

16:55.442 --> 16:56.559
Fine, sure.

16:56.584 --> 16:58.919
It's possible he was
coming from the casino.

16:59.843 --> 17:01.898
So, where was he taking the money?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.482
Did Phil have an accomplice?

17:04.516 --> 17:05.527
Listen...

17:05.907 --> 17:08.416
I really have told you
everything I know.

17:09.723 --> 17:12.539
I got out of the game a long time ago.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.983
I've turned my life around.

17:14.422 --> 17:16.858
No, no.

17:18.683 --> 17:19.864
You're a bad apple.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.233
And bad apples don't turn good.

17:23.194 --> 17:24.666
They spread the rot.

17:27.104 --> 17:28.354
I wish I knew more.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.098
I really do.

17:31.024 --> 17:32.367
So, I could keep it from you.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.309
Am I free to go?

17:38.220 --> 17:40.418
- Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave!
- No. Let him go. Let him go.

17:40.452 --> 17:42.165
You lecture me about
not being there for him,

17:42.189 --> 17:44.316
- and then, you tell me to let him go?
- Did you see his face?

17:44.340 --> 17:46.166
That's not Dave's "I want to chat" face.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.625
Okay, he'll stomp around for a bit,

17:47.659 --> 17:49.191
and then, we'll turn around
and he will be there.

17:49.215 --> 17:51.182
If Dave is mixed up in this,
we have to help him.

17:51.207 --> 17:53.766
Of course we have to help him.
But when he's ready to talk,

17:53.791 --> 17:55.224
then we will do something.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.751
Where are you going?

18:02.322 --> 18:04.295
- Following them.
- The lovebirds?

18:04.737 --> 18:06.386
No, two sneaky sneaks

18:06.411 --> 18:08.702
who are headed toward a crime scene.
Come on.

18:15.107 --> 18:18.222
Hey, Nic. Working hard
or taking souvenirs?

18:18.999 --> 18:20.077
Making progress.

18:20.249 --> 18:21.803
Blood on the inside lining of the suit

18:21.827 --> 18:23.889
told me I might be looking
for a projectile.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.010
Great.

18:25.035 --> 18:26.541
The suit and remains were too degraded

18:26.565 --> 18:29.533
to show any exit or
entrance wounds, but...

18:31.759 --> 18:34.806
this rib here might
be the golden ticket.

18:34.877 --> 18:36.717
Well, I'm no forensic pathologist,

18:36.742 --> 18:38.952
but that looks like a bullet hole.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.169
We found a gun,
but no bullets around the body site.

18:42.858 --> 18:45.383
Which makes me think
it's still in there.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.747
If it didn't exit,
the bullet would have eventually fallen

18:47.772 --> 18:49.053
to the lowest point of gravity.

18:49.155 --> 18:51.811
So, you're going hunting. In there.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.451
After lunch. Hey, you wanna
grab a burrito with me?

18:54.950 --> 18:57.669
Wow. You're really able to
compartmentalize, aren't you?

18:57.975 --> 19:00.147
It's kind of my superpower. You coming?

19:00.592 --> 19:02.867
Let's walk slowly,
I'll decide when we get there.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.660
Body discovered nearby,

19:18.750 --> 19:20.751
and possibly a whack of cash missing.

19:20.981 --> 19:24.272
Suddenly, you start to see your
fellow campers with new eyes.

19:24.756 --> 19:27.551
They look like a couple out
for a nice walk in the woods,

19:27.576 --> 19:29.436
or do they look like they're
looking for something?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.573
Like they're looking for something.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.110
Like a place to get busy.

19:41.406 --> 19:43.888
We should definitely not
be bearing witness to this.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.077
Let's go, let's go.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.522
- Who's there?
- Sh...

19:49.018 --> 19:51.682
Hey, guys.

19:51.707 --> 19:52.721
Hi!

19:55.279 --> 19:57.669
We, We were just wanting to see

19:57.694 --> 19:59.070
if you guys wanted
to go rock painting.

19:59.094 --> 20:01.092
Yeah, sorry. We really
didn't mean to interrupt.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.171
No, no.

20:02.196 --> 20:04.676
We're just having a little fun
in the great outdoors, you know?

20:05.223 --> 20:06.773
Well, we'll let you get back to it.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.632
Thank you so much for your help before.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.006
The bleeding stopped
within a few minutes.

20:10.030 --> 20:11.631
Yeah, I would have hated
to spend a bunch of hours

20:11.655 --> 20:13.256
in the hospital just for that, you know?

20:13.633 --> 20:17.526
Hey, we saw what we thought
looked like a police officer

20:17.551 --> 20:19.916
going into your guys' cabin.
Is everything okay?

20:20.119 --> 20:22.088
Yeah. Just fine, thanks.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.393
Come on!

20:23.418 --> 20:26.420
I can keep any intel totally on the DL.
I promise, I'm good.

20:26.518 --> 20:29.365
Greg, I know it's hard for you,
but honey, please be cool.

20:30.516 --> 20:32.044
That's a bad-ass scar.

20:32.575 --> 20:35.459
Yeah. I caught
myself with a fish hook.

20:35.494 --> 20:36.794
What an idiot, right?

20:36.828 --> 20:37.970
Yeah, such an idiot.

20:37.995 --> 20:40.734
We had to spend our honeymoon
in a Belizean emergency room.

20:40.759 --> 20:42.213
Just so romantic.

20:42.315 --> 20:44.360
All right, well, we don't want
to ruin any more honeymoons.

20:44.384 --> 20:45.807
We'll see you guys later.

20:45.832 --> 20:46.892
- All right.
- Bye.

20:47.595 --> 20:50.096
Does it look like she got that
scar from a fish hook to you?

20:50.121 --> 20:52.219
I'm not really up on
my fish hook wounds.

20:52.244 --> 20:53.471
Well, I've seen loads of them,

20:53.496 --> 20:55.096
and you can only get those from bullets.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.514
You just noticing that now?

20:56.884 --> 20:58.173
Yeah, right before you did.

20:58.198 --> 21:01.039
Don't even try to play it
like you noticed it first.

21:01.064 --> 21:02.686
I'm not playin', I'm just sayin'!

21:02.721 --> 21:04.029
My God.

21:04.489 --> 21:07.733
And they're sure the
snowmobiler was Phil?

21:12.898 --> 21:14.547
This is my fault, Dave.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.172
I should have been harder on him.

21:17.196 --> 21:19.186
Don't take that on, Tom.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.415
It looks like Phil was
still in the game.

21:23.852 --> 21:25.712
Police think he was transporting money.

21:26.438 --> 21:27.746
Although they didn't find any.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.160
So, they think Phil was
killed for the money?

21:30.882 --> 21:33.187
Or do they still think the
money's out there somewhere?

21:43.859 --> 21:46.355
Mr. Bonaventura. A moment of your time?

21:46.704 --> 21:48.063
I'm kind of on my way somewhere.

21:48.193 --> 21:50.094
Just a couple of questions,
Mr. Bonaventura.

21:50.534 --> 21:52.172
Or should I call you Tony Combover?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.032
You know, I chose that nickname myself.

21:57.479 --> 21:58.518
On purpose.

21:59.204 --> 22:01.963
I knew that's what people would call me,
so I chose it myself.

22:02.485 --> 22:05.040
- It's called getting ahead of it.
- Be that as it may.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.233
Wondering what you can
tell me about this man.

22:08.147 --> 22:10.452
Don't know him. Crap picture, though.

22:10.555 --> 22:11.936
He looks a lot worse now.

22:12.424 --> 22:14.458
This man has been dead
for several months.

22:14.493 --> 22:15.769
We know he worked for you.

22:15.913 --> 22:18.864
Well, if you say so.
Lots of guys work for me.

22:18.889 --> 22:20.624
Seasonal landscaper stuff.

22:21.066 --> 22:22.725
Not my job to keep track.

22:23.113 --> 22:24.492
This guy ran deliveries.

22:24.781 --> 22:27.037
We think he died
delivering money for you.

22:27.484 --> 22:28.714
Dirty money.

22:30.976 --> 22:34.143
I had Mounties surveilling
me for months.

22:34.261 --> 22:36.825
Months, and nothing ever came of it.
You know why?

22:36.850 --> 22:38.224
Because I'm clean.

22:38.249 --> 22:40.325
Yeah? How about this guy, Tony?

22:40.677 --> 22:42.620
When was the last time
he worked for you?

22:45.264 --> 22:47.881
Hey! I'm thinking for the
talent show tomorrow,

22:47.906 --> 22:50.072
how about I challenge
you to a dance-off?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.228
No.

22:51.253 --> 22:53.517
Come on, we all know you'll
wipe the floor with me.

22:53.573 --> 22:54.573
No, thank you.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.092
- Harl.
- It's okay.

22:57.397 --> 22:59.917
I know what he's trying to do.
And I appreciate it, really.

23:00.932 --> 23:02.041
I'm okay.

23:04.293 --> 23:05.363
I'm just thinking of Phil.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.161
That could have been me.

23:10.448 --> 23:11.528
Come on, man.

23:11.553 --> 23:13.321
We all know you're too smart for that.

23:13.771 --> 23:15.442
Phil wasn't dumb, Harley.

23:17.066 --> 23:18.949
He was trying to get his act together.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.825
I tried to help him,
Tom tried to help him.

23:22.430 --> 23:23.495
Tom?

23:26.792 --> 23:28.340
I didn't tell you guys this, but...

23:29.378 --> 23:31.543
this camp is where I met Tom and Phil.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.412
In the off season, he
opens this place up

23:35.437 --> 23:37.974
to people who need space, fresh air.

23:40.036 --> 23:41.757
Addicts in recovery.

23:44.247 --> 23:45.614
Tom sounds like a great guy.

23:47.264 --> 23:48.314
Yeah.

23:48.417 --> 23:49.807
A former addict himself.

23:50.731 --> 23:52.659
Now, all he wants is to
pay forward the kindness

23:52.684 --> 23:54.270
he received when he was recovering.

23:55.387 --> 23:56.409
I love that.

23:56.823 --> 23:57.830
Yeah.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.231
It's not an official rehab,
but it's helped a lot of people.

24:02.026 --> 24:03.122
Like Phil.

24:04.502 --> 24:05.552
And me.

24:08.271 --> 24:10.860
Hey, Dave, if you don't
mind me asking...

24:10.885 --> 24:12.017
Painkillers.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.838
From your old football injury?

24:15.291 --> 24:16.587
That's where it started.

24:18.102 --> 24:21.300
After a while, you start to
find all kinds of pain to kill.

24:23.247 --> 24:24.534
I'm so sorry, man.

24:24.813 --> 24:25.881
Don't be.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.754
I really didn't want you
guys around for that.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.273
Well, how can we help you now?

24:41.002 --> 24:42.173
You know,

24:44.251 --> 24:45.815
Tom started to act really weird

24:45.868 --> 24:47.446
when I told him about Phil today.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.477
And you know,
the way things are going on around here,

24:53.024 --> 24:54.361
this grand reopening...

24:55.550 --> 24:57.890
I think he came into a
lot of cash recently.

25:00.091 --> 25:02.462
You think he killed Phil for the money?

25:02.487 --> 25:03.526
No.

25:04.050 --> 25:06.659
No, Tom's one of the best people I know.
That doesn't scan at all.

25:06.957 --> 25:10.332
Okay, well,
let's figure out how he's involved.

25:10.357 --> 25:12.138
And then, we can figure
out how to help him.

25:38.762 --> 25:40.777
Now just... remind me
what I'm looking at.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.316
Victim's leg, sir. I x-rayed the remains

25:43.341 --> 25:45.141
once I found bullet
damage on one of the ribs.

25:45.306 --> 25:46.590
That's when I found these.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.637
So, as the body decomposed,

25:48.717 --> 25:51.206
gravity pulled the bullet
down into the leg.

25:51.660 --> 25:53.692
That's right, sir.
We can now say for certain

25:53.717 --> 25:55.707
our snowmobiler was shot
with a semi-automatic.

25:55.822 --> 25:56.930
The location of the wound

25:56.955 --> 25:59.203
tells me he probably died
soon after he was shot.

25:59.279 --> 26:00.988
All right, this is excellent. Excellent.

26:01.013 --> 26:03.093
You find them and get them
to Wes as soon as you can.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.644
Yeah, we're getting close.

26:06.858 --> 26:07.910
What?

26:08.120 --> 26:10.594
I'd forgotten how much I enjoy this.

26:11.008 --> 26:12.086
You know, the legwork.

26:12.398 --> 26:14.432
No pun intended.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.943
What the hell, pun intended.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.822
It's really beautiful here.

26:24.605 --> 26:27.072
Must be a great place to work.

26:27.097 --> 26:28.457
How-how long have you worked here?

26:29.204 --> 26:30.829
On and off, a couple years.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.282
Um, have you ever seen this man?

26:35.014 --> 26:36.094
No.

26:37.241 --> 26:40.471
Really? Because Tom said that
he was here a few times.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.955
- Are you a cop?
- Well, not a real cop.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.045
- But you play one on TV.
- Yeah!

26:47.620 --> 26:50.765
Look, irregardless of why you're asking,
I didn't see nothing.

26:51.143 --> 26:53.120
You know, I don't know the guy.
I never saw him.

26:53.733 --> 26:55.145
Plus, the place is closed in the winter,

26:55.169 --> 26:56.839
you know, so you can't get in here.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.851
Anyway, I gotta get back to work.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.929
You know, I don't just
play a cook on TV.

27:02.642 --> 27:03.978
Right, thanks.

27:07.521 --> 27:10.390
Hey, I just got bitch-slapped
by that cook over there.

27:10.415 --> 27:12.336
- How about you?
- Well, my friend at the bank

27:12.360 --> 27:14.662
said that Tom just paid
off a big pile of debt

27:14.687 --> 27:17.068
and that the rest of his finances
are looking pretty suspect.

27:17.092 --> 27:18.352
Like he's got a pile of money somewhere?

27:18.376 --> 27:20.028
Yeah, just like that.

27:21.821 --> 27:22.845
Ooh.

27:22.870 --> 27:25.807
- Whoa! Super impressive, man.
- Thank you.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.768
Any other hidden skills
we should know about?

27:27.793 --> 27:28.823
Blacksmithing?

27:29.113 --> 27:31.518
Your envy is so transparent.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.722
I'm guessing that this
isn't a social visit.

27:44.669 --> 27:45.936
I did a little more digging.

27:46.072 --> 27:47.673
Tom Waters acted as a surety

27:47.698 --> 27:49.666
when Phil was released
on a recognizance.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.921
When Phil failed to
appear before a judge,

27:52.298 --> 27:54.079
Tom had to cough up a hefty sum.

27:54.182 --> 27:55.962
That'd tick me off, how 'bout you?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.271
Well, our investigation found
that Tom's financial situation

27:59.296 --> 28:01.091
suddenly got a whole
lot better this year.

28:01.116 --> 28:02.847
I thought I told you to lay off?

28:03.676 --> 28:05.476
Don't you know me even a little?

28:05.660 --> 28:06.995
I don't think Tom's good for the murder.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.539
He was with us when we found the body.

28:08.563 --> 28:10.006
He was genuinely shocked.

28:10.127 --> 28:13.310
True. But Tom is tied
to this money somehow.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.093
- Right, I'm going to go talk to Tom.
- I'm coming.

28:16.252 --> 28:18.131
All right, I'll dig around
for some other suspects,

28:18.155 --> 28:20.742
but I'm telling you,
this cook and that couple, super fishy.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.036
I'll take "Hunger Games"
with me to keep me safe.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.175
I have a signed court document

28:30.200 --> 28:31.871
making you Phil Delorme's surety.

28:32.215 --> 28:35.019
When Phil failed to appear,
you had to cough up a lot of money.

28:35.185 --> 28:37.264
Yeah. How is that relevant?

28:37.358 --> 28:39.639
Well, it's relevant because suddenly,
we have motive.

28:40.498 --> 28:42.834
Phil caused you serious
financial hardship.

28:42.885 --> 28:45.224
But I have an alibi.
I wasn't even here for the winter.

28:45.287 --> 28:47.188
How do you account for
your sudden windfall?

28:47.760 --> 28:50.064
I mean, you renovated this
place without a loan.

28:50.089 --> 28:51.590
You even paid some off.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.673
The last call on Phil's
phone record was to you.

28:54.891 --> 28:57.778
You needed money,
you knew he had access to lots of it.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.193
You told him to come up here

28:59.218 --> 29:00.693
and then... he died.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.344
Now, maybe you didn't pull the trigger,

29:03.735 --> 29:05.743
- but you planned his death.
- No!

29:06.582 --> 29:08.459
No, I didn't do anything like that.

29:08.484 --> 29:11.087
Then, tell us what you did do,
because we all know you did something.

29:11.111 --> 29:12.855
Where did the money come from, Tom?

29:13.166 --> 29:14.284
I got it from Phil.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.221
Okay.

29:17.304 --> 29:18.370
Lay it out for us.

29:19.034 --> 29:20.119
He was using.

29:20.864 --> 29:22.721
He was using, he was in and out of jail.

29:22.747 --> 29:25.889
And after the surety
thing, yeah, we fought,

29:26.032 --> 29:27.170
and I cut him off.

29:27.692 --> 29:29.459
I mean, nothing else was working,

29:29.634 --> 29:31.435
so I tried for tough love.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.762
And then, what happened?

29:33.223 --> 29:35.738
And then, I went away for the winter.
The camp was closed.

29:37.538 --> 29:38.624
And Phil did call me.

29:38.843 --> 29:39.920
And...

29:40.481 --> 29:43.239
I'm ashamed to say that
I ignored the call.

29:43.710 --> 29:44.817
And what happened then?

29:45.355 --> 29:47.989
Well, then, I guess he came to the camp,

29:48.014 --> 29:50.187
and he left me this note.

29:57.335 --> 29:58.902
But the money wasn't his.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.860
Why would he think that
he could leave it for you?

30:00.884 --> 30:03.315
Well, he knew that I had
big plans for this place,

30:03.356 --> 30:06.816
and I wanted to turn it into
a proper treatment centre

30:07.058 --> 30:09.197
with proper counseling,
proper medical staff.

30:09.866 --> 30:13.704
He just wanted to do one
good thing with his life.

30:14.550 --> 30:16.938
You know, and this was his opportunity.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.856
Where did he leave the money?

30:19.512 --> 30:22.716
It was in the dining room
under the floorboards.

30:23.635 --> 30:24.775
And then, what happened?

30:24.854 --> 30:26.635
And then, I never heard from him again.

30:27.797 --> 30:30.023
I mean, I tried calling him many times.

30:30.129 --> 30:33.929
But then, his phone line
just went out of service.

30:35.353 --> 30:37.025
After a few months,
when nobody came for the money,

30:37.049 --> 30:40.352
I just started to put it into the camp.

30:41.662 --> 30:46.428
You know, my friend died
thinking that I hated him.

30:48.497 --> 30:50.937
I mean, how are you supposed to
live with something like that?

30:51.825 --> 30:53.770
By honouring Phil's last request.

30:53.921 --> 30:55.006
Right.

30:55.699 --> 30:56.842
Right.

30:57.109 --> 30:58.694
You make the dream come true.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.203
And did you spend all of the money?

31:02.828 --> 31:04.500
No, no.

31:04.525 --> 31:06.859
There's still easily 600 grand left.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.697
I moved it all out to the woods

31:08.722 --> 31:10.486
after you guys started asking questions.

31:10.511 --> 31:13.103
- I'm going to need to see the money.
- Yeah, yeah.

31:13.565 --> 31:14.667
It's not far.

31:15.483 --> 31:17.870
I buried it next to an old fence

31:18.011 --> 31:19.847
on the east shore of the lake.

31:20.620 --> 31:21.806
Okay.

31:22.939 --> 31:24.408
Let's go treasure hunting.

31:29.798 --> 31:31.407
So, what are we looking for exactly?

31:31.684 --> 31:34.786
Anything suspicious that will throw
light on our other suspects.

31:35.911 --> 31:38.464
Suspicious like a hastily
planned getaway?

31:42.494 --> 31:43.529
Hey!

31:44.522 --> 31:45.544
Excuse me!

31:46.135 --> 31:47.302
Derwyn, right?

31:47.429 --> 31:49.599
Hey, can we talk to you for a sec?

31:53.305 --> 31:55.306
Where are you... really?

31:57.343 --> 31:58.833
Derwyn! Stop!

32:00.179 --> 32:02.379
- Freeze, mofo!
- Argh!

32:04.169 --> 32:05.750
Was the tackle necessary?

32:06.255 --> 32:08.019
Was the "mofo" necessary?

32:09.005 --> 32:10.346
Okay, fair point.

32:11.671 --> 32:13.830
Derwyn, why are you running?

32:16.852 --> 32:20.779
Because I was there the
night Phil got shot.

32:24.782 --> 32:27.005
You are taking us to
the money, right, Tom?

32:27.218 --> 32:28.469
On my word.

32:29.522 --> 32:31.835
All right, so if Tom didn't
kill Phil, then who?

32:31.877 --> 32:34.591
Someone else who was looking for the
money but got to Phil too late?

32:34.740 --> 32:37.020
Tony Combover, or someone from
his organized crime group?

32:37.175 --> 32:39.893
Maybe they found out that Phil
was going to give Tom the money,

32:39.918 --> 32:41.478
- and killed him?
- Well, it's possible,

32:41.503 --> 32:43.079
but who else knew about the money?

32:43.104 --> 32:44.783
Well, Combover said the
cops surveilled him,

32:44.807 --> 32:46.771
- and nothing came of it.
- What cops?

32:46.796 --> 32:48.771
Wouldn't we know about an
investigation like that?

32:50.313 --> 32:51.947
You know, Combover is 20 kinds of dirty.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.538
I don't think "nothing" is coming
out of that type of investigation.

32:54.562 --> 32:56.462
Unless he had some dirty
cops in his pocket.

32:56.939 --> 32:59.170
- Much further?
- Yeah, just here.

32:59.195 --> 33:01.230
It's just a few feet down.

33:05.052 --> 33:06.300
The camp was closed.

33:06.839 --> 33:08.273
Nobody was supposed to be up here.

33:08.814 --> 33:12.515
You know, but it was my girl's birthday,
so I knew we could be alone.

33:13.679 --> 33:15.919
I just didn't figure out on
it being a freaking blizzard.

33:16.021 --> 33:17.512
So, you didn't tell anyone about this

33:17.537 --> 33:20.318
- because you were trespassing?
- I just figured if I shut up about it,

33:20.342 --> 33:21.992
it wouldn't come back on me, you know?

33:22.449 --> 33:23.539
So, what happened?

33:23.873 --> 33:26.833
Well, it was real quiet.

33:27.747 --> 33:29.688
Then, we heard a snowmobile.

33:29.766 --> 33:32.602
You know, and after a while,
we heard another one come along.

33:33.939 --> 33:35.017
When we heard the shouting,

33:35.041 --> 33:36.681
that's when we took a
peek out the window.

33:36.866 --> 33:37.999
What did you see?

33:39.312 --> 33:41.097
Aside from a crap ton of snow,

33:42.230 --> 33:44.761
three people standing
there in snowmobile suits.

33:46.381 --> 33:48.170
Then, one of them runs
for his snowmobile

33:48.195 --> 33:50.967
and that's when we heard the gunshots.

33:51.527 --> 33:53.633
- Anyone get hit?
- Yeah, the short guy.

33:54.445 --> 33:55.524
Where?

33:55.831 --> 33:56.838
In the arm.

33:56.863 --> 33:59.213
Then, the other guy who ran
away got plugged, too.

33:59.698 --> 34:00.721
I guess that was Phil.

34:00.912 --> 34:02.712
You know, they fired after him.

34:03.068 --> 34:06.399
Is it possible that the short one,
the one who got hit,

34:06.852 --> 34:08.686
is it possible that he was a she?

34:09.842 --> 34:12.176
Well, yeah, sure, I guess.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.775
Separate bedrooms. I told
you they weren't a couple.

34:38.069 --> 34:39.516
Yeah, well, maybe he snores.

34:39.655 --> 34:41.435
Which, by the way...

34:41.773 --> 34:43.989
- Me? I don't snore!
- Like a buzzsaw.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.371
Come on. Yeah.

34:52.451 --> 34:53.652
Yeah, Wes. What do you got?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.562
The weapon used to kill the snowmobiler

34:55.587 --> 34:58.622
was a Smith & Wesson
40-calibre semi-auto.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.680
Right, a standard issue RCMP weapon.

35:00.744 --> 35:02.547
Yes, the shooter could have been a cop.

35:02.694 --> 35:03.790
And since there's no record

35:03.814 --> 35:05.334
of that shooting ever having happened,

35:05.589 --> 35:07.234
probably a dirty cop, too.

35:07.367 --> 35:08.375
Thanks, Wes.

35:10.405 --> 35:14.550
So, maybe a Mountie deep-sixed an
investigation into Bonaventura,

35:14.575 --> 35:17.479
- so he could rob one of the bag men.
- And followed Phil,

35:17.504 --> 35:19.744
but Phil managed to bury
the money and get away

35:19.769 --> 35:20.870
but not before being shot.

35:21.246 --> 35:22.853
The couple at the camp,

35:22.878 --> 35:25.090
asking nosy questions
and searching the woods.

35:25.115 --> 35:26.926
She had a gunshot scar.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.104
Those are the people that Harley and
Dave were going to go check out.

35:31.823 --> 35:33.260
What is this, surveillance?

35:33.725 --> 35:35.726
There's still easily 600 grand left.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.060
I moved it all out to the woods

35:37.085 --> 35:38.919
after you guys started asking questions.

35:38.944 --> 35:40.964
I buried it next to a
little wooden fence

35:40.989 --> 35:42.623
on the eastern shore of the lake.

35:43.831 --> 35:45.792
Do you know where this old fence is?

35:45.817 --> 35:47.413
No, but I know where east is.

35:48.317 --> 35:50.958
They don't have their phones.
I have to warn them.

35:53.001 --> 35:54.598
I'd worry more about us.

35:57.753 --> 35:59.821
Throw the money over
here, and step back.

36:01.703 --> 36:03.087
You don't want do this.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.586
Listen, Chief,

36:04.720 --> 36:06.597
of whatever podunk town you're from,

36:06.640 --> 36:07.907
I do want to do this.

36:07.932 --> 36:09.266
And you want to listen to me.

36:09.770 --> 36:11.694
You guys are cops, right?

36:12.585 --> 36:13.629
Mounties?

36:14.299 --> 36:17.061
You do not want to spend
time in a federal pen.

36:17.335 --> 36:19.466
I'd give my left nut to be
in a federal pen right now.

36:19.491 --> 36:20.848
You think that's where this ends for us?

36:20.872 --> 36:23.090
Tony found out we tried
to rob one of his mules.

36:23.183 --> 36:25.208
Phil wasn't a mule. He was a person.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.482
A citizen you are honour-bound
to protect, which means...

36:27.506 --> 36:29.789
Which means we're giving
this money back to Tony,

36:30.004 --> 36:32.506
and this whole thing ends right here,
right now.

36:32.531 --> 36:34.344
So, hand over your fricking weapon.

36:40.743 --> 36:41.801
Like I said,

36:42.841 --> 36:44.737
you're not gonna get
any trouble from us.

36:52.256 --> 36:53.656
Put the gun down!

36:53.681 --> 36:55.215
Do not make this worse for yourself.

36:57.538 --> 36:59.595
- Now!
- Okay, all right!

37:00.585 --> 37:03.557
On the ground! On the ground!

37:06.784 --> 37:07.995
Go, Sam! Go!

37:08.291 --> 37:09.354
Stay with the chief.

37:09.379 --> 37:11.542
Don't let that piece of
crap get away with this!

37:12.589 --> 37:14.160
Shots came from over here.

37:20.398 --> 37:23.168
- There's Sam!
- Go that way! Cut him off!

37:30.843 --> 37:31.898
Stop!

37:38.920 --> 37:39.942
Ha ha!

37:40.887 --> 37:42.779
Whoo! Ha ha!

37:43.599 --> 37:46.780
Yeah! In the butt!

37:47.053 --> 37:48.100
What did I tell you?

38:01.917 --> 38:03.100
Hey, stop it!

38:03.552 --> 38:05.034
You doing anything for the talent show?

38:05.058 --> 38:08.368
I don't know. I'm a professional.
It doesn't seem fair.

38:08.393 --> 38:09.861
Yeah, you're right.

38:09.886 --> 38:12.886
It'd be rude to rub all
that talent in their faces.

38:13.259 --> 38:16.224
That was both mean and
unnecessarily sexual.

38:16.463 --> 38:17.490
Yeah.

38:19.492 --> 38:20.912
- Hey.
- How's the chief?

38:20.937 --> 38:22.431
He's doing fine.

38:22.908 --> 38:25.794
He insisted on going back to the station
after they patched him up,

38:25.819 --> 38:28.239
where, I hear, he got a standing ovation

38:28.557 --> 38:30.391
and his wife read him the riot act.

38:30.606 --> 38:31.840
Good.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.239
How are the dirty Mounties?

38:34.407 --> 38:36.408
That's a new cocktail name.

38:38.603 --> 38:41.975
Well, Jenna will be in lock-up for
a very long time, as will Greg.

38:42.117 --> 38:44.485
Luckily, his wound was superficial.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.783
Hey, I was just catching the bad guy...

38:47.300 --> 38:48.986
who also killed my friend.

38:49.365 --> 38:51.533
Agreed, which is why you're getting off

38:51.558 --> 38:54.205
for shooting an arrow
into a human being.

38:54.230 --> 38:55.613
That felt so good!

38:55.803 --> 38:57.199
Chief told me to tell you

38:57.224 --> 38:59.582
"not bad for a bad apple,"
whatever that means.

39:01.712 --> 39:03.245
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

39:03.270 --> 39:05.430
I just want to thank you
folks again for all your help.

39:05.664 --> 39:07.009
How did things go at the station?

39:07.225 --> 39:09.235
Well, my lawyer said the good news is

39:09.260 --> 39:10.883
technically, I didn't break any laws,

39:10.908 --> 39:13.643
but I still got a few things
to iron out with the tax man.

39:13.872 --> 39:14.974
That's great, brother.

39:15.544 --> 39:17.201
Hey, Harley,
can I talk to you for just a second?

39:17.225 --> 39:19.384
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks, man. Sorry.

39:24.987 --> 39:27.067
I'm happy everything
worked out with Tom.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.107
He's a good man.

39:30.398 --> 39:32.309
He probably saved your life.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.651
No,

39:37.418 --> 39:38.444
you did.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.468
That night you arrested me.

39:43.488 --> 39:45.359
I was totally off the rails.

39:45.714 --> 39:46.777
A mess.

39:49.024 --> 39:52.860
I had been doing some pretty heavy
"hate myself" drinking that night.

39:54.448 --> 39:59.427
And what you didn't know is
I had signed on to do a job

39:59.452 --> 40:01.802
that was in no way going to end well.

40:02.861 --> 40:03.973
I knew.

40:05.407 --> 40:06.410
What?

40:07.079 --> 40:08.933
I mean, that's why I arrested you.

40:09.678 --> 40:13.683
Well, that and you were acting
like a dangerous idiot. But...

40:15.414 --> 40:18.433
you know... having you in
jail kept you out of play

40:18.458 --> 40:20.603
for a critical day or two.

40:21.542 --> 40:23.006
You never did take that job.

40:24.849 --> 40:26.756
Well, aren't you full of surprises.

40:28.398 --> 40:29.883
I'm kind of amazing.

40:32.451 --> 40:34.122
Yeah, come here.

40:36.178 --> 40:37.317
I really appreciate it,

40:37.342 --> 40:40.236
but there's no way I can accept
such a generous loan from you.

40:40.261 --> 40:41.862
I'd never be able to repay it.

40:42.183 --> 40:44.783
Well, it's not a loan.
It's a charitable donation.

40:45.205 --> 40:46.573
You know, for your camp,

40:46.779 --> 40:48.253
and all the plans you
have for this place.

40:48.277 --> 40:49.577
Yeah, but it's so much money.

40:50.369 --> 40:51.447
Well, it's just money.

40:52.207 --> 40:53.751
I mean, you're the one doing the work.

40:53.949 --> 40:56.009
The important work.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.957
You know, helping people get
a chance to fix their lives.

41:00.963 --> 41:03.380
And let's face it,
it's only partly because of you.

41:05.183 --> 41:06.808
Well, thank you.

41:08.374 --> 41:09.481
Thank you so much.

41:14.437 --> 41:15.487
Yeah!

41:19.211 --> 41:20.247
Where's Dave?

41:20.272 --> 41:22.126
I don't know,
but I think he's next up in the show.

41:22.150 --> 41:25.275
Really hoping for "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" on the bagpipes.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.400
I know.

41:27.146 --> 41:28.260
Here he is.

41:29.475 --> 41:30.879
Go get 'em, Dave.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.053
Whoo!

41:51.372 --> 41:52.375
Come on.

41:54.217 --> 41:55.255
Yeah!

42:09.821 --> 42:12.055
Whoo! Yeah!
