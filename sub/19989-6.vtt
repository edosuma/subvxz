00:00.600 --> 00:01.880
What have you got against Michael Farmer

00:01.930 --> 00:04.430
except him being retarded
enough for you to frame?!

00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:15.480 --> 00:17.630
Is this you, Michael?

00:17.680 --> 00:19.240
I'm not sure

00:24.000 --> 00:27.990
DC Desford, for what reason have
you been accessing highly sensitive

00:28.040 --> 00:32.509
AC-12 files, namely DI Matthew
Cottan's Dying Declaration?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.030
This wasn't me, sir.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.990
But I don't want to be
somewhere I'm not wanted,

00:36.040 --> 00:37.140
so I'll take a transfer

00:38.760 --> 00:41.670
And obviously the person with the
opportunity and means to frame both

00:41.720 --> 00:44.870
Michael Farmer and Timothy
Ifield is DCI Roz Huntley.

00:44.920 --> 00:50.310
Your files should be handed over
to a new, more impartial authority.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.710
What are friends for?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.760
Let me give you a different phone number.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.310
There's a network of corrupt
police officers doing

01:01.360 --> 01:02.710
the bidding of organised crime.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.950
"H?" His name begins with H.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.310
"H."

01:06.360 --> 01:10.060
Superintendent Hastings, you will be
served with a Regulation 15 notice.

01:12.320 --> 01:17.040
The wound was very deep. If they
didn't operate, you could've died.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.000
- No!
- Shh!

01:26.080 --> 01:29.830
We've learnt Mr Huntley shares a
solicitor with Michael Farmer.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.750
I represented Michael.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.680
What went on between myself
and my client is privileged.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.190
I've got tangible concerns that
she's involved in a serious crime.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.360
You were at the crime scene the
night Tim Ifield was murdered.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.550
Nicholas Huntley, I'm
arresting you on suspicion of

01:53.600 --> 01:56.030
the murder of Timothy Ifield.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.470
You're hurting me.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.240
That was incredibly brave
and honest of you, ma'am.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.520
It was Roz, she's lying
about everything. Everything.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.190
The hotel wasn't able to
provide an adjoining room...

02:29.240 --> 02:30.800
on such short notice...

02:32.560 --> 02:34.640
.. but the other one's just down the hall.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.520
I know it's difficult.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.030
It's just while the
officers are at the house.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.840
Is Dad going to come here too?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.070
These things take time.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.910
Why aren't you doing anything,
why aren't you helping him?

02:50.960 --> 02:52.910
It's complicated.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.440
I want the other room.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.750
You think Nick Huntley would've
risked leaving evidence here,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.670
his missus a copper?

03:12.720 --> 03:16.630
'Message for DS Twyler. There's
a DS out here to see him.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.080
Received.

03:22.120 --> 03:27.030
- DS Twyler? - DS Railston,
DC Antonioni, Murder Squad.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.470
What can I do for you?

03:28.520 --> 03:30.670
Nick Huntley's solicitor's
kicking up a stink.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.270
He's accusing Polk Avenue officers

03:32.320 --> 03:35.270
of favouring their own
DCI's story over his.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.950
Your Chief Super's worried the
defence could use it in court.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.230
You're taking over?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.880
Sorry.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.750
Kate.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.990
Polk Avenue is starting the
first round of interviews.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.550
There's no news yet.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.950
Dammit! She's done it again.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.070
We had that case in the palm of our hands,

03:57.120 --> 03:59.310
and she's thrown everybody
off the scent! Who's on it?

03:59.360 --> 04:02.590
Murder Squad, plus AC-9
observing -- Jamie Desford.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.270
AC-9 -- Desford. God give me strength.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.040
The whole thing's kicking off!
We're not even in the game!

04:13.040 --> 04:14.200
Kate.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.310
Who from Murder Squad?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.070
Mr Huntley, I'm Detective
Sergeant Railston, this is my boss,

04:20.120 --> 04:22.750
Detective Chief Superintendent Hargreaves.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.950
We're Murder Squad out
of Fourth Street Station.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.910
None of us have any previous
work connection with DCI Huntley.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.830
However, detectives from
AC-9 will be observing

04:30.880 --> 04:34.150
'in connection with ongoing
anti-corruption inquiries.'

04:34.200 --> 04:35.670
'Noted.'

04:35.720 --> 04:37.800
'What you were doing
at Tim Ifield's flat?'

04:41.880 --> 04:43.560
My wife, Roz...

04:44.720 --> 04:46.600
DCI Huntley, she...

04:51.280 --> 04:52.670
I was following her.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.760
All right. Why was that, then?

04:57.160 --> 05:00.840
I suspected that she was
seeing someone else, an affair.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.430
Was she?

05:03.480 --> 05:06.830
I believe so, that's what she told
me, with another police officer,

05:06.880 --> 05:08.230
a married man.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.310
Mrs Huntley denies an affair,

05:10.360 --> 05:13.390
and our inquiries find there was
no other officer present that night.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.110
So you thought Tim Ifield was
having sex with your wife?

05:17.160 --> 05:18.470
No. I don't know...

05:18.520 --> 05:21.110
How would you describe your
emotional state that evening,

05:21.160 --> 05:22.350
Mr Huntley?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.790
Were you in a frame of mind to
control your wife's behaviour,

05:24.840 --> 05:26.470
Mr Huntley, to coerce her?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.830
No, no, no... She was the
one that went to the flat.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.230
She went inside!

05:30.280 --> 05:33.070
There are no witnesses to your wife
entering Timothy Ifield's flat.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.990
No CCTV. No traffic cameras.
No mobile phone GPS data.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.830
Well, she'd left her mobile phone at home.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.350
So did you, pal.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.990
I was in a rush. I'd forgotten it.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.830
So this fella, this Timothy Ifield,

05:43.880 --> 05:46.830
who you may or may not have thought
was having sex with your wife,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.310
- what did you plan to do to
the pair of them? - Nothing.

05:49.360 --> 05:53.230
Nothing. Why would I kill Timothy Ifield?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.750
How would I?

05:54.800 --> 05:57.030
- We look at three things.
- Opportunity.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.670
- You were there.
- Means.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.710
Tim's not a big fella, not a fighter,

06:00.760 --> 06:02.990
- there were knives in the flat.
- Motive.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.190
You believed he was having
an affair with your wife.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.720
No. No. Look. No! This is all
Roz. She's trying to frame me!

06:10.680 --> 06:15.350
"So it wasn't me, it was
the one-armed woman." Eh?

06:15.400 --> 06:16.800
'Is that it?'

06:17.840 --> 06:20.350
My gaffer wants the 18-search
of Huntley's home completed

06:20.400 --> 06:21.960
by first thing in the morning.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.790
Hi.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.280
Hi.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.070
How's it going?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.600
All right.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.840
- I heard about your accident.
How are you doing? - I'm fine.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.070
So what's Nick Huntley been saying?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.910
She's not at liberty to disclose.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.470
And this was our case.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.270
Not according to Assistant
Chief Constable Hilton.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.070
He assigned you?

06:48.120 --> 06:51.200
Hastings didn't appreciate
my ability. Hilton does.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.070
I'm sorry.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.550
You know what, you dumped Steve
at the first sign of trouble.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.760
I think it's a bit late for apologies.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.520
Night.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.000
Wait.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.360
This has to be totally off the record.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.480
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.230
'And then I saw her'

07:27.280 --> 07:30.390
stop off at a minicab office.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.470
So she took a minicab

07:31.520 --> 07:33.670
'part of the way and then
she carried on on foot.'

07:33.720 --> 07:35.110
- To Tim's flat?
- Yes.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.800
- She went inside?
- Yes.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.710
Roz got out of the cab to
avoid the traffic cameras.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.190
She was inside Tim's flat
while Nick was waiting outside

07:45.240 --> 07:47.270
in his car, like Marion and Geoff.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.120
And then he sees something.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.110
Uh... around...

07:54.160 --> 07:56.110
seven...

07:56.160 --> 07:59.310
'a man came out of the flat. And then...

07:59.360 --> 08:03.830
'an hour later he came back
with a couple of shopping bags.'

08:03.880 --> 08:06.910
All right, what was in these bags?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.110
I don't know.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.550
All I remember is there was a big tube
sticking out of one of them, like a...

08:12.600 --> 08:14.320
Like a roll of something.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.280
That fits with the security cameras
at the DIY store that evening.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.880
A large roll of plastic sheeting.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.230
Can you describe this man?

08:27.280 --> 08:30.990
Medium height, medium build.
Receding hair. Fair hair.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.640
Tim Ifield.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.390
And then there's this.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.080
When did you leave Tim's flat?

08:38.480 --> 08:40.270
Uh...

08:40.320 --> 08:42.000
about 11.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.270
A woman came out of the flat,
and she was looking at my car.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.990
She'd arrived a few minutes
earlier, in a nurse's uniform.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.510
Tim's downstairs neighbour,

08:52.560 --> 08:55.000
who told us she mistook
Nick's car for a minicab.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.270
'I thought she might'

08:57.320 --> 09:01.630
get suspicious, so I left. I drove home.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.470
Your wife says different.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.870
'She was at home, off sick from work.'

09:06.920 --> 09:09.310
You didn't come rolling in till
nine the following morning.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.630
No! No! That was her!

09:10.680 --> 09:12.560
She was the one that was out all night!

09:13.560 --> 09:16.790
It's hard to know who
to believe, Nick or Roz.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.590
A traffic camera spotted Nick's car
leaving the area at just after 11,

09:20.640 --> 09:22.750
exactly as he's stated in his interview.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.190
Maybe he's telling the
truth -- he went home.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.590
Roz hired a minicab to
avoid the traffic cameras.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.270
According to Nick, she was
still in the flat when he left.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.150
Unfortunately no-one saw her leave.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.870
But we know she was on foot.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.630
That's a hell of a distance
to walk all the way home.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.310
Her car was at the minicab
firm, that's much nearer.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.080
I'll check it out.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.350
Roz Huntley pitched up at the
minicab firm as a walk-in.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.470
No name given, no contact information

09:58.520 --> 10:00.590
and the place doesn't
have security cameras.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.790
Yeah, well, she knew the
one to pick, all right.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.990
One of the drivers recalled a
woman as being dark-skinned,

10:06.040 --> 10:07.310
but that was all,

10:07.360 --> 10:10.070
and no-one saw her return
the next day for her car.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.630
Sorry, sir.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.160
That's it. We've lost
her. The trail's gone cold.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.560
No, it hasn't.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.350
Tim Ifield died of severe blood loss.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.910
There's no way anyone managed
to kill him and clear up the

10:25.960 --> 10:29.190
whole crime scene without getting
bloodstains on their clothing.

10:29.240 --> 10:33.150
A search of the crime scene uncovered
spare hangers in Tim's wardrobe

10:33.200 --> 10:36.350
that bore grey synthetic fibres
probably from a tracksuit.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.910
This item of clothing
has never been found.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.550
The killer took the tracksuit.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.030
It'd be a perfect choice.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.470
It's loose-fitting and it's also unisex.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.870
I mean, it could've been worn
by Roz just as easily by Nick.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.310
Yeah, well, that's all very good,

10:49.360 --> 10:52.030
but it doesn't really tell us what
either of them were doing next.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.870
Actually, it does, sir.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.950
Tim's murderer couldn't risk
being seen in a new outfit.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.470
By wearing it, the tracksuit
could've become contaminated

10:59.520 --> 11:02.510
with his or her DNA, so he
or she had to dispose of it.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.510
Their next move had to be to return home

11:04.560 --> 11:06.310
to pick up another change of clothes.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.230
Roz Huntley knows inside out all
the mistakes offenders make in

11:09.280 --> 11:10.990
the hours following a crime.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.910
And, as SIO, she was aware that
nobody even knew Tim was dead yet.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.790
And she knows when his body's
found, those 24 hours around

11:16.840 --> 11:19.270
the time of death are going to
be the main focus of the efforts

11:19.320 --> 11:20.830
to pick up the evidence trail.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.230
If they'd have had the guts,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.430
they'd have sat tight on
that evidence before finally

11:24.480 --> 11:27.670
disposing of it as far away as
possible from their known haunts.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.150
Right. Well, let's see what they
were up to on the days following

11:31.200 --> 11:33.470
- Tim Ifield's murder.
- Listen up.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.350
We're to conduct a citywide
security camera survey for

11:36.400 --> 11:38.630
the period beginning the 19th of March.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.990
The suspects are Nicholas Huntley
and DCI Roseanne Huntley.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.950
ANPR survey targets their
registered vehicles.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.950
If either of them made a false
move, we need to find it. Let's go.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.470
On the medical side,

11:50.520 --> 11:53.110
we'll make sure you get the
best treatment, no matter what.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.910
Thank you very much, sir.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.950
Now, I wish they could be,
particularly in the circumstances,

11:58.000 --> 11:59.910
but certain things can't be ignored.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.750
My husband.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.160
I understand, sir.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.950
Hence I've recused myself
from leading the inquiry.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.560
I wish it were enough.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.710
There are unresolved
allegations against you.

12:14.760 --> 12:19.360
I'm sure I can persuade everyone
to conclude proceedings quietly...

12:20.760 --> 12:22.790
.. if you intend to resign.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.230
It's the only way you take back control,

12:25.280 --> 12:27.790
and it's the only way to
avoid further challenges to

12:27.840 --> 12:29.470
the charging of Michael Farmer.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.390
I've given everything
to this job. Everything.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.830
No.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.230
I'm not bent, sir.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.430
I'm a diligent, dedicated
officer, a loyal officer.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.150
- Of course you are. - Why aren't
you backing me, sir? - I am.

12:45.200 --> 12:50.320
But AC-12's findings extend further,
to your husband's solicitor and you.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.110
Jimmy Lakewell and me? How?

12:55.160 --> 12:58.390
They claim between you you had
prior knowledge of Michael Farmer's

12:58.440 --> 13:00.350
criminal record.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.070
It's going to be such an
uphill struggle to fight.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.560
Resign and it'll all be behind you.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.750
'She blames me for'

13:33.800 --> 13:35.390
the operation on her arm.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.630
'The doctors tried to save
it, but it was already dead.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.550
'The infection had spread
into her bloodstream.'

13:41.600 --> 13:44.390
But she was the one that was
trying to hide all of this.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.950
'She was the one that was
avoiding seeing our GP.'

13:47.000 --> 13:48.680
Why was she trying to hide it?

13:50.760 --> 13:54.790
She said that she'd grazed
her hand on some brickwork.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.830
'Now, I was doubting that, and
so was the doctor, because...'

13:57.880 --> 14:00.350
Because they found that
it was infected with MRSA,

14:00.400 --> 14:02.800
'which must have come
from another person.'

14:09.400 --> 14:10.670
What is it, sir?

14:10.720 --> 14:13.030
Well, the hospital was forced
to disclose the details of

14:13.080 --> 14:15.110
Roz Huntley's medical condition and, er...

14:15.160 --> 14:18.910
Apparently it started with a cut on
her arm that then became infected.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.270
But look at the date.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.390
Nick Huntley says he
first noticed his wife

14:22.440 --> 14:24.280
was wearing a plaster on her arm...

14:27.640 --> 14:29.640
.. the day after Tim Ifield's murder.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.790
It's not possible to examine
the patient's amputated hand.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.390
It was incinerated. Standard practice.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.470
But the samples that the surgeons
took, the infection swabs

14:43.520 --> 14:47.190
and tissue biopsies and stuff,
they'd still have those.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.910
How specific can you
get about the infection?

14:49.960 --> 14:52.310
Well, erm... Caroline...

14:52.360 --> 14:56.470
The laboratory can do whole
genome sequencing of the bacteria.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.350
I think it's about as specific
as DNA profiling the person.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.830
From the victim's body,

15:00.880 --> 15:03.910
could the bacteria be matched to
the bacteria that came from him?

15:03.960 --> 15:07.590
- How old's the body?
- He died seven weeks ago.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.110
I'm no expert, but I imagine by now

15:10.160 --> 15:13.240
he'll be like a garden
overrun with weeds. Sorry.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.120
I'll just get your medication.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.670
Sorry.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.190
Can you just explain how MRSA
from one person can get into

15:25.240 --> 15:26.990
the wound of another person?

15:27.040 --> 15:30.590
MRSA is a commensal organism
-- it lives naturally

15:30.640 --> 15:34.070
and harmlessly on the carrier,
usually inside the nose.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.590
You can imagine how easily
the bacteria can transfer to

15:37.640 --> 15:39.950
the carrier's own hands and
then infect a wound or...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.120
- Sorry. It lives in the
carrier's nose? - Yeah.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.840
OK. You've been a great help. Thank you.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.590
- Yeah.
- 'Hi, sir, it's Kate.'

15:54.640 --> 15:57.790
Weren't there fibres removed at
postmortem from Tim Ifield's nose?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.630
They were believed to be from a balaclava

15:59.680 --> 16:02.030
- he wore shortly before his death.
- 'Yes, that's right.'

16:02.080 --> 16:05.110
Right, well, the fibres were sampled
just a few days after his death.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.110
There is a chance it's still
infected with the MRSA bacteria

16:08.160 --> 16:10.110
'if Tim was a carrier.'

16:10.160 --> 16:12.830
Right, OK, leave that with
me, I'll get on to the labs.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.640
I'll make it a matter of priority.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.550
Thanks so much for this, Jodie.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.240
I'm happy to help, ma'am.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.950
- You said you found something?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.430
I, erm...

16:31.480 --> 16:33.470
I ran a database check,

16:33.520 --> 16:37.430
to see why AC-12 might question a
link between you and Mr Lakewell.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.030
Nothing turned up regarding
a professional connection,

16:40.080 --> 16:43.510
as you've said, you only know him
socially, through your husband.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.310
So I ran Mr Lakewell's
name as a cross-check

16:47.360 --> 16:50.110
with other case keywords.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.270
Lakewell was Michael Farmer's solicitor

16:53.320 --> 16:57.200
when Farmer was convicted
of rape as a 16-year-old.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.680
What? What does that mean exactly?

17:07.640 --> 17:09.440
I'm not sure, Jodie.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.470
I need you to do one more thing for me.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.790
Yeah, sure, no problem.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.190
I need you to carry out
some telecoms inquiries.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.710
Will you do that for me, please?

17:21.760 --> 17:23.109
Yeah.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.310
How are you getting on, son?

17:25.359 --> 17:28.310
Both Roz and Nick Huntley's
cars have shown up all over town,

17:28.359 --> 17:31.550
but both their movements check out
only with their known haunts --

17:31.600 --> 17:33.550
home, work.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.390
I reckon Roz knows the
locations of the ANPR cameras.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.710
Yeah. And avoided them all, the wee witch.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.550
We're now going through all the
CCTV and traffic cameras ourselves.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.280
God. A bit of a tall order
given the time we've got.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.960
Jodie.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.350
They're still after you, ma'am.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.310
'I thought you should know that AC-12...'

18:04.360 --> 18:07.960
have just requested access to Tim's flat.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.320
Thank you, Jodie.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.190
Right...

18:14.240 --> 18:16.320
This is where Tim's body was found.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.190
There was that one interesting
piece of forensics the, er...

18:21.240 --> 18:24.040
Here. The isolated blood spatter.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.630
Someone went to a lot of trouble to
make that appear it was Tim's blood.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.670
I mean, why not just
wipe it up like the rest?

18:30.720 --> 18:32.030
Yeah, it's a tiny speck of blood.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.910
I mean, on the night of
the murder, the killer,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.870
he mops up all these pools of blood,
but mind you, this is easily missed.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.790
Yeah, then maybe Huntley spotted it
when she returned to the crime scene

18:39.840 --> 18:42.270
a few days later to
investigate the murder.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.590
When she saw it, she got
scared that it could have been

18:44.640 --> 18:47.190
- her husband's blood, or hers.
- I was here on the day.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.710
The place was crawling
with FIs and coppers.

18:50.760 --> 18:55.070
And the only way she could have
tampered with this particular evidence

18:55.120 --> 18:58.070
- is when it got back
to the station. - Yeah.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.750
And she needed access to the
evidence that she'd disposed of

19:00.800 --> 19:03.110
because that is the only
source of Tim's blood.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.630
- Yeah, Steve.
- 'Sir.'

19:04.680 --> 19:06.190
Roz Huntley's movements.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.350
- Concentrate on the day you found
Tim Ifield's body. - The 23rd.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.070
'Yeah, the 23rd straight through
to the early hours of the morning'

19:12.120 --> 19:13.670
of the 24th, that's the window,

19:13.720 --> 19:15.680
that's when she had to play her hand.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.510
The 23rd of March, 15.00 onwards,

19:19.560 --> 19:21.670
through to the early hours of the 24th.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.560
Roz Huntley's car, Tim
Ifield's flat. Find it.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.760
Come in.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.030
Thank you for coming to me.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.310
There are restrictions on
you visiting Polk Avenue

19:46.360 --> 19:48.870
while inquiries are ongoing.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.590
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable here, ma'am.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.710
The searches are nearly done, so
you should be able to go home soon.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.790
You told me to contact you if
I remembered anything unusual

19:58.840 --> 20:02.360
- about my husband's behaviour
the night of Tim's murder. - Yes.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.920
The following morning he was
unloading the washing machine.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.840
But there was only one
item that I could make out.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.920
A navy jumper.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.070
We've seized all your husband's
clothing from your address,

20:24.120 --> 20:26.880
so we'll see if we can track
down this navy jumper.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.710
Thank you. That's all.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.320
Thanks, ma'am.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.070
Steve, you're going to
want to hear this --

20:39.120 --> 20:40.880
we've got the results from the lab.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.670
Examination of the wool
fibres detected postmortem in

20:45.720 --> 20:49.030
Tim Ifield's nose found they
were overgrown with MRSA.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.510
Whole genome sequencing proves the
organism is indistinguishable from

20:52.560 --> 20:55.710
the strain of MRSA swabbed from
Roz Huntley's infected wound.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.270
Sorry, but this only provides
evidence that Roz Huntley

20:58.320 --> 21:00.990
was involved in a struggle with Tim
on some occasion before he died.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.030
What if Nick Huntley
walked in on their struggle?

21:03.080 --> 21:04.870
I mean, he could still be the killer.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
- We're closer, but we're
not there yet. - Yeah.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.630
Hello.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.440
Yes, superintendent, yes, yes.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.480
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.150
What is it, sir?

21:18.200 --> 21:21.590
Murder Squad have just sent a
piece of Nick Huntley's clothing in

21:21.640 --> 21:23.750
for urgent forensic analysis.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.630
They've got another 12 hours to hold him.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.990
This is it, guys, make or break.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.070
Sir.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.270
They don't need to be able to fully
prove you're guilty, that's for trial.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.670
They just need to cross a
threshold of credible evidence,

21:34.720 --> 21:36.750
and in their eyes Roz
is a credible witness.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.390
They're all on her side, the lot of them.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.230
I got them to bring in
an independent team, Nick.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.390
There were anti-corruption officers,

21:44.440 --> 21:48.590
- Roz was scared of them, they kept
coming after her. - What, AC-12? - Yeah.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.390
Get them involved, please,
Jimmy, just get them on the case.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.950
OK.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.600
- I'm going to lose everything. I'm
going to lose everything, my kids...
- Nick. Nick! I'll do my best.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.240
Sorry.

22:13.560 --> 22:17.150
Re impartiality, I could speak
to my Chief Super if you think

22:17.200 --> 22:19.030
there's anything else we could be doing?

22:19.080 --> 22:21.270
No. We're all good. Thank you.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.000
Great.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.070
Yeah.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.520
Sir?

22:37.800 --> 22:41.030
Switch the light on there. Yeah,
I lost track of time there.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.390
What is it?

22:42.440 --> 22:44.560
- We've got something else, sir.
- Oh, right.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.000
Sir.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.990
Roz Huntley's car on the
afternoon of the 23rd of March.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.910
And this is after she'd
left the crime scene

22:56.960 --> 22:58.790
when Tim Ifield's body
was first discovered.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.040
And she's heading in
the direction of home.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.670
That's Roz Huntley at Polk Avenue.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.790
And for some reason she's decided to
come in to the station late that night.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.550
Sir, you remember we impounded
Roz Huntley's phone to look for

23:11.600 --> 23:13.550
GPS data the night of Tim Ifield's murder?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.710
Well, she switched off her
phone at a crucial period,

23:15.760 --> 23:18.150
so we couldn't place her at Tim's flat.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.430
Now, fortunately we got access
to the phone after the 24th,

23:21.480 --> 23:24.550
so the movements we've just seen
here are stored on the phone.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.870
And?

23:25.920 --> 23:29.430
And GPS data confirms that she
went home after leaving Tim's flat.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.350
It also confirms that she
travelled from home to Polk Avenue

23:32.400 --> 23:33.830
as seen here.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.950
However, Huntley switched
off her phone at 01.00 on

23:38.000 --> 23:42.430
the 24th to 04.00 when she set
off from home to Polk Avenue.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.070
And that's the exact same precaution
she took to cover her tracks

23:45.120 --> 23:47.550
- when she went to Tim's flat on
the night of the murder. - Right.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.550
A body's been found, you're the SIO,

23:49.600 --> 23:51.950
you wouldn't switch off your
phone, not in a million years.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.550
She was definitely up to something.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.310
Yeah. And whatever it was
was between 01.00 and 04.00.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.590
Sir, we've got a window of
only three hours to look at.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.270
I mean, there's a chance we'll spot
where she went to in that time.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.750
Good work. All right,
everybody. Listen up.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.550
We've got a new window between
01.00 and 04.00 hours on the 24th.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.350
We're looking for any sightings
of DCI Huntley's vehicle.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.270
What she did, where she went.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.400
This is the final push.
Come on. We cannot fail.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.630
For the DIR, DC Antonioni is showing

24:22.680 --> 24:25.590
the interviewee item reference TRH-7.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.880
TRH-7 is a man's navy blue jumper.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.960
Whose clothing is this, Mr Huntley?

24:39.040 --> 24:42.310
It could be mine, I don't know,
it could be someone else's.

24:42.360 --> 24:46.240
'Sweat deposits and skin cells
detected on the collar match your DNA.'

24:48.080 --> 24:50.640
Like I said, it could be...

24:52.520 --> 24:54.310
It could be mine...

24:54.360 --> 24:55.950
I'm going to read from a report

24:56.000 --> 24:58.240
just received from our forensic scientist.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.870
"In addition, human hair
bearing follicular cells

25:01.920 --> 25:03.750
"was detected on TRH-7.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.830
"DNA matched a control sample
relating to Timothy Ifield..."

25:06.880 --> 25:08.350
No! No!

25:08.400 --> 25:11.110
".. with greater than 99.9% probability."

25:11.160 --> 25:14.550
I never met Timothy Ifield! I've
never been anywhere near him!

25:14.600 --> 25:17.000
So you're admitting it's your clothing?

25:19.240 --> 25:22.950
I'd like some time in private
to confer with my client.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.520
21.25, stopping the tape.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.350
What is it?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.590
We've found Roz Huntley's car
in the early hours of the 24th.

25:37.640 --> 25:42.950
2.45am. She's coming off the
A38 heading north on the A51.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.310
Out towards the Chase.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.510
No cameras out there.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.550
No cameras, and a huge
radius for the search area.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.590
It's an impossibly large area, sir.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.430
If she disposed of evidence,
we can't prove it.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.880
And without that evidence, we don't
know if Roz really was the killer.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.960
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't be daft.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.680
I'm proud of both of you.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.000
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.640
Right, everyone. Time to go home.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.350
Jodie?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.910
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.800
The CPS agreed that the
threshold test had been met.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.670
Your husband's been charged
with Tim Ifield's murder

26:56.720 --> 26:58.590
and he's going to be remanded.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.790
And they're also looking
at him in connection with

27:00.840 --> 27:04.560
Leonie Collersdale's disappearance
and Hana Reznikova's abduction.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.240
'You still there, ma'am?'

27:11.920 --> 27:13.600
Thank you, Jodie.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.960
I have to be strong, for my children.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.360
Gate, please.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.310
- Kate.
- Yeah? Sorry.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.430
Roz Huntley ventured miles from home,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.680
but we know she still
made it back by four am.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.230
That's massive travel time.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.470
She only gave herself a few minutes
to actually dispose of the evidence.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.070
- And it's three am. It's pitch dark.
- Yeah, she's not going to risk

28:23.120 --> 28:25.430
dumping it somewhere random only for

28:25.480 --> 28:28.390
- the evidence to be an easy find
in broad daylight. - Exactly.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.750
The only reason she'd
risk travelling so far

28:30.800 --> 28:33.390
is if she knows precisely
where she's going.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.550
I doubt she's ever dumped evidence before.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.960
But she's searched for it.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.310
We're looking for a search Roz
Huntley's team carried out where

28:43.360 --> 28:46.310
the evidence was so well-hidden
it took a very long time to find.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.670
But concentrate in and around the
Chase, within a 20-mile radius

28:49.720 --> 28:53.070
of Roz Huntley's last known
position at 03.00 on the 24th.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.920
Find Huntley's destination.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.150
So the searches are all complete.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.000
You can have your own rooms
again, that's better, isn't it?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.280
Right, that's yours.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.720
I'll make us a nice breakfast, yeah?

29:28.480 --> 29:30.080
They still love their dad.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.200
Ma'am...

29:35.240 --> 29:37.310
.. I found the information
you were requesting.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.840
The telecoms activity around the
time of the attack on DS Arnott.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.440
I doubt it matters any more.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.160
Is there anything else I can do?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.280
Thanks, Jodie

29:59.040 --> 30:02.110
Two years ago, Roz Huntley's team
investigated a domestic murder.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.750
The boyfriend always denied
involvement and it was looking like

30:04.800 --> 30:07.110
he was going to get away with
it due to lack of evidence,

30:07.160 --> 30:09.750
until his bloodstained clothing
was found in this area.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.310
All PolSA searches had failed.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.550
It was a chance finding
by a member of the public.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.310
The murderer confessed to dumping
the evidence in this area.

30:16.360 --> 30:20.710
Right. OK, everybody, we're going
to start from here and fan out! OK?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.200
Sir. Diane, you're with me up top.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.200
Oh, right.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.200
Leave this to me. You keep at it. Go on.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.070
I have to remind you, sir, you've
been served a Regulation 15 notice.

30:45.120 --> 30:49.040
I was aware of that. We're
following a legitimate lead.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.150
Sir, if I've been
insubordinate, I've acted alone.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.790
My officers are simply following orders.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.440
Round up your team and
leave this to Murder Squad.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.830
Sir!

31:07.880 --> 31:10.590
There's a patch of ground, it looks
like it's recently been dug up.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.200
- Put a cordon around it.
- Establish an inner cordon.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.200
- Carry on.
- Sir.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.720
I'll see you at the hearing.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.160
Don't expect it to go well... H.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.710
Roseanne Huntley, you're under arrest.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.150
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

32:21.200 --> 32:22.720
- if you do not mention...
- Stop.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.760
Anything I say, I say to AC-12.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.870
Are you expecting someone else?

32:38.920 --> 32:40.110
Erm...

32:40.160 --> 32:44.070
DC Jodie Taylor. I asked her to call you.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.870
I was worried that if you knew it was me,

32:45.920 --> 32:47.960
you would have turned me down.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.120
I'm under arrest.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.200
Oh, my God!

32:56.960 --> 32:58.600
I want you to represent me.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.630
I would have turned you down, Roz.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.230
There's a clear conflict
of interest with Nick.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.440
Please, Jimmy...

33:09.840 --> 33:11.200
.. just for a few hours.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.960
You're the only person I trust right now.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.110
'We'll be referring to evidence
uncovered on the Queen's Chase woodland,

33:25.160 --> 33:28.320
'in a remote area excavated in
conjunction with Murder Squad.'

33:30.160 --> 33:32.470
Item reference YLM-1.

33:32.520 --> 33:36.070
YLM-1 is a rucksack found
buried in a shallow pit.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.230
Skin cells detected on
the zip fasteners of YLM-1

33:39.280 --> 33:42.230
and follicular hair cells
found in the front compartment

33:42.280 --> 33:45.710
both match control samples
relating to Timothy Ifield.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.310
We believe YLM-1 belonged
to Timothy Ifield.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.110
Image 25 shows item reference
YLM-5 to YLM-8, items of

33:54.160 --> 33:58.030
bloodstained female clothing found
in a rucksack buried on the Chase.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.830
The bloodstains match control
samples relating to Timothy Ifield.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.350
The quantity of blood deposited
indicates these items of clothing

34:05.400 --> 34:08.429
were in close contact with Timothy
Ifield as he bled to death.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.989
These items of clothing bear DNA
deposits matching an individual

34:12.040 --> 34:15.199
whose DNA profile is held
on the police database.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.989
Do you have anything to say
at this point, DCI Huntley?

34:22.639 --> 34:24.230
No comment.

34:24.280 --> 34:29.110
Image 32. Image 32 shows
item reference YLM-9.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.949
YLM-9 and 10, a grey tracksuit
composed of fibres matching those

34:33.000 --> 34:36.230
detected on a hanger found
at Tim Ifield's flat.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.469
It also bears traces of DNA
matching the same individual as

34:39.520 --> 34:41.870
the set of bloodstained clothing.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.429
And this grey tracksuit was stolen
by the killer at the scene of

34:45.480 --> 34:49.310
the crime and then worn to
dump the bloodstained clothing

34:49.360 --> 34:51.510
that would have connected him...

34:51.560 --> 34:54.590
or her to the murder.

34:54.639 --> 35:00.070
On screen, image 19, showing
item reference MRT-6.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.950
MRT-6 is a forensic oversuit.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.750
Blood deposited on MRT-6 matches
control samples relating to

35:06.800 --> 35:08.310
Timothy Ifield.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.710
Only one other person's DNA
was detected on this item.

35:11.760 --> 35:19.630
MRT-3, a balaclava, MRT-4,
a jacket, MRT-5, gloves --

35:19.680 --> 35:22.950
all these items bear traces
of Timothy Ifield's DNA.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.950
It would appear Ifield was also
equipping himself to simulate

35:26.000 --> 35:27.790
the appearance of Balaclava Man.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.350
Or Occam's Razor -- he was Balaclava Man.

35:31.400 --> 35:36.270
Image 51 and 52, items BTW-1 and BTW-2,

35:36.320 --> 35:39.190
a mobile phone and a laptop computer.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.230
Both match models registered
to Timothy Ifield.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.110
Both severely corroded by acid,

35:44.160 --> 35:46.150
rendering their hard drives unreadable.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.630
Skin cells matching to Timothy
Ifield were detected on

35:48.680 --> 35:51.070
the phone's touch ID sensor.

35:51.120 --> 35:54.030
Some of these cells show a
chemical profile suggesting

35:54.080 --> 35:56.030
they'd been deposited after his death.

35:56.080 --> 36:01.150
It seems the murderer used the
amputated fingers to work the phone.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.630
Image 88. RN-1.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.070
RN-1 was recovered from
the cache of evidence

36:06.120 --> 36:08.070
found buried on Queen's Chase.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.110
RN-1 is a power saw.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.790
Deposits of Timothy Ifield's
blood were detected on the blade.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.480
So the killer did not
go armed to Tim's flat.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.150
That saw was already there,

36:19.200 --> 36:21.630
and we know that because Tim
had bought some power tools

36:21.680 --> 36:23.670
at a DIY store.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.510
Image 93. CED-2.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.190
CED-2 are the amputated
fingertips of the second,

36:29.240 --> 36:31.950
third and fourth digits of the right hand.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.470
They're a DNA match to Timothy Ifield.

36:34.520 --> 36:37.990
The saw blade bears cells
matching these fingers.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.590
It was used to amputate the fingers

36:39.640 --> 36:42.710
shortly after Tim Ifield's death.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.390
Biological material detected under
the nails of the amputated fingers

36:46.440 --> 36:50.030
matches the DNA of the same
person whose DNA was found on

36:50.080 --> 36:52.440
the bloodstained female clothing.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.510
Tim was dying.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.510
His last act was to claw
at the murderer's hand

36:58.560 --> 37:01.510
to capture their DNA
under his fingernails.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.720
So not only do we have
the murderer's DNA...

37:06.560 --> 37:10.310
.. but we have the exact strain
of bacteria detected on Tim

37:10.360 --> 37:14.590
that was grown from the wound
that he inflicted on his killer.

37:14.640 --> 37:20.240
Now, do you have anything
to say now, DCI Huntley?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.790
At this point, I have to
declare a conflict of interest.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.270
As Mrs Huntley is likely
to state she was present,

37:27.320 --> 37:30.990
possibly unwillingly, and that
the actual murder was committed

37:31.040 --> 37:32.950
by my client, Nicholas Huntley,

37:33.000 --> 37:37.030
in which case Mrs Huntley requires
alternative legal representation.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.760
I'm afraid you'll have to
pause the interview there.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.400
I confess to accidently
killing Timothy Ifield.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.510
Roz...

38:00.560 --> 38:02.150
'you don't have to say anything.'

38:02.200 --> 38:04.680
'His blood's all over my clothes.'

38:05.920 --> 38:07.880
My DNA in his fingernails.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.560
Our children will need a parent.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.480
I acted alone.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.830
My husband took no part.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.190
My witness testimony was false

38:23.240 --> 38:24.920
'and I withdraw it.'

38:26.160 --> 38:29.790
Tim's DNA found on my husband's
clothes was planted by me

38:29.840 --> 38:33.430
a few minutes after my husband's
arrest using a hair brush

38:33.480 --> 38:37.880
that I stole from Tim Ifield's
flat the morning after his death.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.400
All proceedings against Nick
Huntley should be stopped.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.670
So Tim Ifield blew the whistle on you,

38:49.720 --> 38:52.760
but you concealed your
movements that night.

38:55.480 --> 39:00.470
Was it your pre-meditated
intention to harm Timothy Ifield?

39:00.520 --> 39:03.470
I went to Tim's flat to
challenge him, that's all.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.430
I covered my tracks purely in case

39:05.480 --> 39:08.360
he decided to raise an official complaint.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.750
Things became heated.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.990
There was a struggle.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.470
I hit my head. Blacked out.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.760
And when I came round, he was
in his forensic oversuit.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.480
I was laid out on plastic sheeting...

39:25.880 --> 39:28.480
.. and he had tools to dismember my body.

39:29.720 --> 39:33.710
Are you telling me that one
of our most experienced FIs

39:33.760 --> 39:36.830
didn't know that you weren't dead?

39:36.880 --> 39:40.470
He must have tried to find a
pulse and, when he failed,

39:40.520 --> 39:43.000
he jumped to the conclusion
that it wasn't there.

39:45.920 --> 39:50.030
And when I came round, he panicked,
and when I tried to fight back,

39:50.080 --> 39:52.030
he panicked even more.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.720
He knew I'd be able to accuse
him of attempted murder.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.880
And we struggled over the saw.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.440
It was an accident.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.480
I was trying to wrestle it free...

40:13.960 --> 40:15.680
.. when it nicked his neck.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.440
It was like slow-motion.

40:22.640 --> 40:27.150
That first trickle of
blood and then a surge.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.560
He bled out all over himself, all over me.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.440
He clawed at my hand and then he was dead.

40:36.040 --> 40:40.080
As a police officer, it was your
lawful duty to report that death.

40:41.160 --> 40:45.310
I honestly did think about calling
it in and telling the truth.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.750
But I know the law.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.710
How hard it is to prove self-defence.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.270
I've seen a thousand
crime scenes and no-one,

40:52.320 --> 40:54.760
no-one leaves that with their life intact.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.360
Tim was gone.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.680
I couldn't save his life, but
I could try to save mine.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.640
So you cleaned up the crime scene?

41:06.760 --> 41:08.350
Yes.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.560
But you were disturbed the
next morning by Hana Reznikova?

41:12.640 --> 41:15.430
I saw her on Tim's computer.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.950
He had that stupid
surveillance system of his.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.750
How could you access the computer?

41:19.800 --> 41:23.080
It was just an automatic
feed. The image, it came up.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.790
So you used his finger to activate
the fingerprint ID on his phone?

41:27.840 --> 41:29.680
One of the amputated fingers.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.800
That enabled me to text Hana.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.550
Tell her to go away.

41:36.600 --> 41:41.990
I found a notes file on his phone,
with passwords, and that meant

41:42.040 --> 41:45.630
that I could use those to take
control of his phone and computer.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.600
You waited before
disposing of the evidence?

41:50.080 --> 41:53.640
Rash actions in the first few hours
are the downfall of most offenders.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.950
I thought I could think of everything.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.550
What you did think of was blaming
everybody else, but yourself,

42:00.600 --> 42:02.510
including your own husband.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.990
You've tried to frame Michael Farmer,

42:05.040 --> 42:09.590
an innocent, vulnerable suspect,
not to mention Hana Reznikova.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.070
And you've cast unwarranted aspersions on

42:12.120 --> 42:15.590
the integrity of AC-12, and myself.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.590
Justice could not have been
further from your thoughts.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.000
Well, here's justice...

42:21.120 --> 42:22.600
Roseanne Huntley...

42:23.800 --> 42:27.070
.. I shall now be seeking the
authority of the Crown Prosecutor

42:27.120 --> 42:28.670
to charge you with these offences --

42:28.720 --> 42:30.950
the murder of Timothy Ifield

42:31.000 --> 42:33.800
and perverting the course of
justice. Do you understand?

42:34.520 --> 42:36.830
Yes, sir, I do.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.150
At this point, I'd like to
stress that on the night of

42:39.200 --> 42:42.870
Timothy Ifield's death, Mrs
Huntley was in a state of shock

42:42.920 --> 42:46.790
and fear and experienced a
momentary loss of control.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.520
I'll be recommending a plea of
manslaughter based on those grounds.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.510
- Trust me, Roz.
- I do...

42:55.560 --> 42:56.920
and so did Nick.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.270
In fact, when DS Arnott informed Nick that

43:02.320 --> 43:05.790
he was going to interview him
in connection with Tim's death,

43:05.840 --> 43:08.160
who was the first person that Nick called?

43:10.200 --> 43:11.720
Not me.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.040
Am I still a police officer?

43:18.160 --> 43:19.600
Yes, for the moment.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.200
Thank you, sir.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.670
James Lakewell, you do
not have to say anything,

43:26.720 --> 43:29.550
but it may harm your defence
if you fail to mention

43:29.600 --> 43:33.070
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

43:33.120 --> 43:36.070
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.800
Now... Wait a minute...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.150
'My colleague, DC Taylor,

43:42.200 --> 43:45.190
'sourced telecommunications
records from the 6th of April.'

43:45.240 --> 43:49.990
The day that DS Arnott was assaulted
at my husband's office building.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.830
Nick received an incoming
call to his registered mobile

43:52.880 --> 43:54.550
from DS Arnott.

43:54.600 --> 43:57.150
Immediately afterwards he
made a call to Mr Lakewell's

43:57.200 --> 43:58.550
registered phone.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.190
This call lasted
approximately five minutes.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.280
Nick was seeking my legal advice.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.870
I asked DC Taylor to look into calls
made between unregistered mobiles --

44:09.920 --> 44:12.470
burner phones of the type
used for illicit activity

44:12.520 --> 44:14.240
in the vicinity of your office.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.870
She identified the following call

44:18.920 --> 44:22.030
made from this unregistered mobile,

44:22.080 --> 44:25.550
just a few minutes after the
call between you and Nick.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.270
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I
don't see the relevance.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.790
I'm sure you will once AC-12 have
had a chance to analyse the calls

44:31.840 --> 44:34.950
and movements made by the burner
phone detected at your office.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.430
It's going to match your known
movements and activities.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.990
I think I should leave.

44:40.040 --> 44:43.870
I think you should sit down, fella,
or I'll handcuff you to that desk.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.070
Sit down.

44:46.120 --> 44:50.160
The call James Lakewell made was
received by another burner phone.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.070
This second burner phone made
a call immediately afterwards

44:54.120 --> 44:56.110
to a third burner phone.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.550
Please, let's look at
this third burner phone.

44:58.600 --> 45:02.750
Said phone is no longer active, but
using historical triangulation data

45:02.800 --> 45:05.630
we were able to track
the phone's movements.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.590
The call was received in the
Moss Heath area and the phone

45:08.640 --> 45:11.550
proceeded directly to the location
where DS Arnott was assaulted

45:11.600 --> 45:13.470
a few minutes later.

45:13.520 --> 45:17.350
The third burner phone belonged
to the man who abducted Hana,

45:17.400 --> 45:20.310
who planted evidence in
Michael Farmer's house

45:20.360 --> 45:22.310
and who assaulted DS Arnott.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.880
Balaclava Man.

45:25.120 --> 45:29.590
James Lakewell defended Michael
Farmer at his first offence.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.470
I knew nothing about it,
you've got to believe me.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.270
It was Jimmy who served up
Michael Farmer to be framed,

45:35.320 --> 45:38.270
not by me, but by the people who
are really behind this cover-up.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.550
Which brings us to the second
burner phone, the one that received

45:41.600 --> 45:45.950
Jimmy Lakewell's call on the 6th of
April and contacted Balaclava Man.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.120
Item reference RH-1.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.040
This is a napkin from the Kingsgate Hotel.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.350
The man who gave it to me used
the number for what I believed at

45:59.400 --> 46:02.750
the time was limited to
illicit sexual activity.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.990
This is the number that got
the call from James Lakewell

46:06.040 --> 46:08.340
and passed the information
to Balaclava Man.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.880
It belongs to Assistant
Chief Constable Derek Hilton.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.760
Jesus Christ.

46:24.960 --> 46:28.190
'James Lakewell, you are under arrest for'

46:28.240 --> 46:30.550
perverting the course of justice.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.830
This interview is now terminated.

46:32.880 --> 46:37.160
Steve, hold him until we can arrange
custody. Kate, you're with me.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.840
- Secure these exits.
- Sir.

46:51.760 --> 46:55.350
All right. OK, got it, thanks.
Hilton is in his office alone.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.750
Door shut. His PA says she'll hold
him there if he tries to leave.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.790
Yeah. AC-12. Stand down.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.430
There was a conspiracy.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.030
I was never in on it.

47:04.080 --> 47:07.430
I thought I was playing them,
but I was the one being played.

47:07.480 --> 47:09.390
That's half the story.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.710
Hilton counted on you putting
your career ahead of the truth.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.520
Jimmy set me up with Hilton.

47:16.320 --> 47:18.830
He knew how desperate I
was to close the case,

47:18.880 --> 47:21.150
and how open I was to being pressurised.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.040
No-one needed me to point that out.

47:25.280 --> 47:30.150
Tim Ifield dead, Michael Farmer
and Hana Reznikova in prison.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.430
From where I'm sitting,

47:31.480 --> 47:34.350
it looked like you made those
choices all by yourself.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.160
I'm not a bad person.

47:38.960 --> 47:42.070
Maybe you would have done the
same if you'd been in my situation.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.800
I'd have stopped sooner.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.360
I'd be able to walk and
you'd have two hands.

47:50.840 --> 47:52.440
Remain seated.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.600
- Four, go.
- 'Six, go.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.990
So who's Balaclava Man?

48:07.040 --> 48:09.230
Balaclava Men, plural.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.070
If you don't do their bidding,

48:11.120 --> 48:15.070
a body gets taken out of cold
storage with your DNA all over it.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.510
You think Hilton's top dog?

48:16.560 --> 48:18.750
How come he bricks it every
time a new body's found?

48:18.800 --> 48:21.870
Tell us who he is. We'll
give you immunity.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.550
There are some people
there's no immunity from.

48:24.600 --> 48:27.390
Thanks for holding them.
We're taking it from here.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.310
Taking him where?

48:29.360 --> 48:32.560
Protective custody. Assumed
name. Undisclosed location.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.550
I'll need to run that by the gaffer.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.200
Yeah, sure.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.880
Yeah, good to go up
here. You set downstairs?

48:48.080 --> 48:48.910
Steve.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.030
Sir, just to let you know,

48:50.080 --> 48:52.430
AC-9 are here to take Lakewell
into protective custody.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.590
Hilton's been tipped off. Do not comply.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.830
Will do. Thanks, sir.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.040
AC-12. Urgent lockdown!

49:02.240 --> 49:04.630
Yeah, all good.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.190
Good.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.910
Yeah, we're on our way down.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.680
Turn around, please.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.670
Where am I going exactly?

49:18.720 --> 49:22.150
I am not at liberty to disclose.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.510
What about me?

49:23.560 --> 49:26.070
A different custody location.
Another team's coming for you.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.230
You'll want the DIR disk.
I'll run off a copy.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.870
No. No, you're all right, mate,
I don't want to hang about.

49:30.920 --> 49:33.040
Standby for further instructions, yeah?

49:55.080 --> 49:56.710
What's wrong with this thing, man?

49:56.760 --> 49:58.440
Slow this time of night.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.150
What the hell are you trying to do?

50:06.200 --> 50:09.000
Listen to me, Jamie, we know
someone tipped off Hilton.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.840
He sent you, didn't he?

50:13.160 --> 50:17.030
- I just need this lift working, mate.
- The lifts have been disabled.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.750
And you need to wake up, mate.
Lakewell isn't going into custody.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.990
Hilton's never going to let that happen.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.470
I bet you he even told you
what route to take, didn't he?

50:24.520 --> 50:26.950
No prizes for guessing what's
going to happen in transit.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.920
You'll just be collateral damage.

50:35.120 --> 50:36.760
I'm not going anywhere.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.350
Come on, we're taking the stairs.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.950
And you're talking bollocks.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.950
Right, Hilton's got my back, 110%.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.920
That's exactly what he said to me.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.110
You walk out of here, you're a dead man.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.680
Hello!

50:55.160 --> 50:57.070
Something's not right, sir.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.670
Armed Police!

50:58.720 --> 51:01.280
- Come on!
- Stop him! Stop him!

51:03.360 --> 51:05.910
Don't do this, Jamie!

51:05.960 --> 51:07.710
Jamie, don't...

51:07.760 --> 51:09.630
Jamie, there's still a way out for you.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.720
Don't trust the wrong man. Don't
make the same mistake I did.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.240
Back! Back off!

51:20.880 --> 51:23.470
Cooperate with our inquiry into
Hilton and you're in the clear,

51:23.520 --> 51:25.430
but that's only if no-one gets hurt!

51:25.480 --> 51:27.600
- There's no way out! Drop the gun!
- Back off!

51:29.720 --> 51:31.080
Drop it!

51:32.720 --> 51:34.840
All you've got to do
is give me the firearm.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.710
Right. Secure the exits. You
three with me up the stairs.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.150
Get the medics to that man.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.990
Just give me the firearm.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.310
- Armed Police!
- Armed Police!

51:45.360 --> 51:47.680
- Don't shoot!
- Armed police!

51:50.840 --> 51:52.910
Drop the firearm, Jamie.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.040
Do as he says, Jamie.
Listen to him, Jamie.

51:57.720 --> 52:01.070
There's a fella lying dead
downstairs cos he didn't cooperate.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.920
Don't test us, Jamie.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.270
Come on, mate, give me the gun.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.030
All right.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.600
Just give me the gun.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.080
Cuff him.

53:09.840 --> 53:13.840
No sign of a struggle, no
evidence anyone else was here, sir.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.080
Suicide.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.590
Well, you might not
recognise this location,

53:21.640 --> 53:24.870
but a body was found here, Oliver
Stephens-Lloyd, a social worker

53:24.920 --> 53:27.550
trying to blow the whistle
on child sexual exploitation.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.800
His death was made to
look like suicide too.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.110
We know Hilton had been tipped off.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.280
He could have easily
have made a run for it.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.800
Or he knew the game was up.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.400
Right. Who's in charge here?

53:54.280 --> 53:55.950
The man you shot in the lobby, sir,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.510
he's been identified as
a known violent criminal

53:58.560 --> 54:01.870
with long-term associations going
all the way back to Tommy Hunter.

54:01.920 --> 54:05.910
Activity on Balaclava Man's burner
phone matches all his known haunts.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.990
His biometrics are an exact match
to the images of Balaclava Man

54:09.040 --> 54:11.590
captured on the night of Leonie
Collersdale's disappearance

54:11.640 --> 54:13.590
and the day of the attack on Steve.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.080
Even down to his boot print.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.990
You got him, sir.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.870
I got one of them.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.070
There may be others still at
large. God knows what they're up to.

54:23.120 --> 54:26.110
And the consistent method has been
to exploit vulnerable young women

54:26.160 --> 54:28.670
to blackmail officers into
fearing they'd be incriminated

54:28.720 --> 54:30.430
in serious offences.

54:30.480 --> 54:32.870
They had that hold over Hilton too.

54:32.920 --> 54:34.750
Whether or not he was "H."

54:34.800 --> 54:36.830
Meaning he wasn't top dog.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.150
Top in the police.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.870
But not among the real criminals.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.150
What, bent coppers not
criminal enough for you, son?

54:43.200 --> 54:44.520
Sir.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.120
I'm satisfied "H" was ACC Hilton.

54:49.800 --> 54:52.120
Take my photograph down
off that board, Kate.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.560
This is beginning to
feel like a life's work.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.920
Left.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.720
Stop.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.480
Turn.

56:21.305 --> 56:27.691
