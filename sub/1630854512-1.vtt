Are you all right?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.750
Come on, don't give up!

01:02.083 --> 01:03.625

How can you be so stupid?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.500
Let's go! Let's go!

01:31.041 --> 01:33.833
Sofia, stay calm. Don't let it get to you.
Stay calm!

01:33.916 --> 01:35.125
Eighty-five,

01:35.208 --> 01:37.083
63, you're out!

01:40.541 --> 01:42.500
I never got why she does that.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.583
If you're attacked,
you gotta defend yourself.

02:09.375 --> 02:10.541
-All right, Sofi!
-You got it!

02:10.625 --> 02:12.000
That's it. That's it, you got it!

02:31.958 --> 02:33.708
We're gonna make it happen!

02:34.625 --> 02:36.041
You guys did awesome!

02:39.500 --> 02:40.708
See you later, ladies.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.083
Bye, Sofia. See you.

02:42.166 --> 02:43.041
Ciao, Sofi.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.083
Ciao, <i>danke</i>.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.083
Hey!

02:49.166 --> 02:50.583
-You guys did it.
-Later.

02:50.666 --> 02:51.500
Bye, Sof.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.333
Hi, babe.

02:54.416 --> 02:55.416
Hey.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.875
You like Hakim?

03:04.250 --> 03:06.375
Good guy, I suppose.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.458
But if he hurts her,
he's gonna have to deal with me.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.750
Santo, please. Come on.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.458
What do you say?

03:16.541 --> 03:18.833
-I'll call you later?
-Yeah, that sounds cool.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.083
-Okay.
-See ya.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.000
Bye-bye.

03:25.958 --> 03:27.708
There's the champion.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.500
Well done, Sofi.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.791
-Thank you!
-You were amazing.

03:31.875 --> 03:32.791
-Thank you.
-Well done.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.416
Hop in.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.416
Come on, get in.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.458
You gonna keep your promise if I do?

03:41.541 --> 03:42.875
What promise? I don't recall one.

03:42.958 --> 03:44.333
Papa, stop that.

03:44.416 --> 03:46.708
-May I know what is this about?
-Well, he promised

03:46.791 --> 03:49.083
that if I did what it takes
and we got into the playoffs…

03:49.166 --> 03:50.541
-Hmm?
-Are you gonna?

03:52.166 --> 03:53.250
Are you gonna?

03:55.791 --> 03:57.375
-Okay.
-All right!

04:21.125 --> 04:23.208
Why did you promise her
a thing like that?

04:23.291 --> 04:25.791
My love, she's almost 18.
She'll get her license soon.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.208
Just gonna teach her a few things.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.833
Santo, please.
You know how dangerous it is.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.583
You're always making me worried--

04:31.666 --> 04:32.750
Mm.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.166
Okay.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.000
Ciao, my lover.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.583
Relax, she's a great driver.

04:41.666 --> 04:42.500
Bye, Mama.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.583
You remember, right? Fast!

04:54.666 --> 04:56.375
Are you sure?

04:56.458 --> 04:57.916
Go, go, go!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.083
Push it, Sofi. You got it!

05:02.833 --> 05:05.375
Watch that bump on the right.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.333
Back it up.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.125
That's when you juice it. Go!

05:21.041 --> 05:23.291
That is so fucking crazy.

05:50.833 --> 05:51.958
I'm sorry.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.750
Ah, we'll sort it out later. Go on.

05:53.833 --> 05:54.958
All right.

05:59.041 --> 06:00.291
Nah. No, thanks.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.541
Next week, we should get your mom
to come up here with us.

06:06.625 --> 06:08.375
Or would that be the end of her?

06:08.458 --> 06:10.041
Oh, um…

06:10.125 --> 06:13.125
I've been meaning to tell you
about next Sunday. Um…

06:13.208 --> 06:15.041
Well, this weekend,
I have plans with Hakim.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.541
A little retreat on a motorcycle.
No big deal, you know.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.500
Hmm.

06:23.541 --> 06:26.291
Our friends will be there too, you know.
It won't just be us.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.333
Um, yeah.

06:32.208 --> 06:35.166
And, do you think
you could convince Mama?

06:40.791 --> 06:41.708
Okay.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.083
Oh, my God. Thank you!

07:02.416 --> 07:03.791
Look how beautiful this is.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.833
Are the mountains in Calabria
like this too?

07:10.958 --> 07:12.833
They have the same silence.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.541
Papa, why did you move here
when you were so young?

07:21.083 --> 07:22.250
For love.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.166
Mama's a lucky woman.

07:31.958 --> 07:33.083
Come on.

07:33.166 --> 07:35.541
Let's try and be home
before it gets dark.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.041
Can we get one quick picture?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.500
No. You know I don't like 'em.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.625
Why don't you let me?
It's just to remember our day.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.000
We don't need a photograph
to remember it by.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.916
Come on Dad, let's go.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.458
Yeah, hold on.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.291
Okay, that'll hold till we get home.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.125
MY NAME IS VENDETTA

08:30.333 --> 08:33.125
We've confirmed
that all the biometric data's a match.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.083
We got him, sir.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.000
Stop! Something's off!

09:01.083 --> 09:02.375
What's up?

09:02.458 --> 09:03.666
It's not cutting straight.

09:04.916 --> 09:07.250
It's 0.5 mm at the most!

09:07.333 --> 09:09.875
Let's finish the job and fix it tomorrow.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.500
I wanna do it now.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.333
Would you be able to pick up Sofi for me,
at practice?

09:14.416 --> 09:15.583
-Of course.
-<i>Danke.</i>

09:30.500 --> 09:31.458
Hi, Mama.

09:31.541 --> 09:32.583
Hi, Sofia.

09:32.666 --> 09:33.916
How was practice today?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.625
Good. It was good.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.333
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20

09:53.833 --> 09:55.750
Can you help me
get dinner on the table?

09:55.833 --> 09:58.416
Yeah, let me throw my jersey
in the wash, and I'll be there.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.625
Thank you.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.000
Hey, little sister.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.583
Hi.

10:11.666 --> 10:15.250
What about Santo?
I've called him hundreds of times!

10:15.333 --> 10:16.916
He's fixing the saw.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.083
This late?

10:19.416 --> 10:21.291
I tried to tell him,

10:22.166 --> 10:24.708
but your husband is stubborn, you know?

10:30.708 --> 10:31.666
Here he is.

10:32.291 --> 10:33.958
He'll be full of grease.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.666
Then tell him to undress outside!

10:39.708 --> 10:40.833
<i>Patrick! Help!</i>

10:40.916 --> 10:42.375
Help! Patrick!

10:47.041 --> 10:48.875
<i>Patrick!</i>

10:48.958 --> 10:51.291
Help! Patrick!

11:10.208 --> 11:11.166
<i>No!</i>

11:21.000 --> 11:21.958
Mama?

11:53.750 --> 11:55.583
Now she could be anywhere.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.708
-We have to find that bitch.
-Let's go.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.333
We gotta get out of here now.

12:03.416 --> 12:04.333
Fuck!

12:12.541 --> 12:14.166
RECENTS

12:14.250 --> 12:15.666
DARLING

13:01.708 --> 13:02.625
Ingrid.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.208
Oh, God. Sofia.

13:41.791 --> 13:42.916
Sofia!

13:49.083 --> 13:50.166
Papa.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.000
-Mama…
-We have to get out of here.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.666
Papa, call an ambulance!

13:56.750 --> 13:58.500
-We have to go now.
-No, let go of me!

13:58.583 --> 13:59.958
They're dead, we have to leave.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.916
You're hurting me.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.666
Mama!

14:03.750 --> 14:05.541
Mom! Mom!

14:05.625 --> 14:06.583
Mom!

14:10.250 --> 14:11.750
Why are we running away?

14:11.833 --> 14:13.833
And how could we just leave Mama
like that?

14:13.916 --> 14:15.166
Not right now, Sofi.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.291
Tell me!

14:16.375 --> 14:18.375
-Not right now.
-You have to tell me now!

14:18.458 --> 14:20.416
Sofi!

14:22.500 --> 14:23.708
I want to know what the hell--

14:23.791 --> 14:26.458
I can't tell you right now!
You fucking understand?

14:45.708 --> 14:48.291
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>good news or bad news?</i>

14:48.375 --> 14:50.500
<i>Unfortunately, the girl got away.</i>

14:50.583 --> 14:53.416
But other than that, the news is good.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.916
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

14:56.000 --> 14:58.083
<i>Come see me at my place.</i>

14:58.875 --> 15:00.416
It'll be late.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.208
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

15:03.875 --> 15:06.083
<i>Us old folks don't sleep much.</i>

15:06.750 --> 15:08.125
See you later.

15:26.416 --> 15:28.041
What is this place?

15:30.375 --> 15:32.708
Tell me where we are,
I don't want to fucking stay here.

15:32.791 --> 15:35.375
It's just for tonight.
Tomorrow, we'll find something better.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.041
Pa, why haven't we called the police yet?

15:37.125 --> 15:38.583
-'Cause we can't.
-Why not?

15:46.583 --> 15:47.500
They'd take me.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.625
But you haven't done anything wrong.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.416
Oh, enough.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.041
Wait, wait. Listen to me.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.916
We're in danger,
or we wouldn't be in here.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.416
-We're lucky not to be dead too.
-Just leave me alone.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.541
Wait, stop!

16:01.625 --> 16:02.833
Listen!

16:02.916 --> 16:04.916
Now shut up.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.375
And follow me.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.416
Good evening, Don Angelo.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.500
Good evening.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.458
Pause it there.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.125
Fuck, it's not him.

17:25.458 --> 17:28.166
How is that possible?
The picture looks just like him.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.416
<i>You have to fix this.</i>

17:30.333 --> 17:32.958
Don Angelo wants him dead,
and that brat too.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.666
Jesus, what a goddamn mess.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.583
You'd better hurry up, or we're dead.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

17:38.666 --> 17:41.833
Okay, I get it. I'm on it.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.250
And tell Vituzzo.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.833
Tell him the bastard is still alive.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.916
THE CALL OF THE WILD

19:11.875 --> 19:14.916
THE CALL OF THE WILD BY JACK LONDON

19:20.416 --> 19:21.625
Papa?

19:25.166 --> 19:27.583
Papa, please. I can't take it anymore.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.125
Tell me what the fuck
are we doing here!

19:34.208 --> 19:36.958
Why won't you answer me?

19:39.166 --> 19:41.125
That's enough.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.458
Okay, okay.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.083
It's okay.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.791
Before I was introduced to your mother,

19:57.375 --> 19:59.208
my whole life was different.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.625
I was a different person.

20:03.708 --> 20:04.583
Who were you?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.083
I wasn't a good person.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.958
You know of 'Ndrangheta?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.375
It's a Sicilian Mafia.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.041
And blood ties are the strongest thing

20:32.125 --> 20:34.208
if you come from a family
that's part of it.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.541
There's no escape.

20:40.833 --> 20:44.166
They'd put a gun in your hand
and tell you to shoot rival families.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.250
Either you die or the other person dies.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.833
My name is not Santo Romeo.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.750
My real name is Domenico Franzè.

21:15.291 --> 21:18.166
That's why you avoided
having your picture taken, didn't you?

21:20.708 --> 21:21.916
Oh, God.

21:24.958 --> 21:25.916
I…

21:26.875 --> 21:28.250
I took one of you.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.416
It doesn't matter.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.791
Yes, it does!

21:30.875 --> 21:33.000
Because you made me
believe a lie my whole life,

21:33.083 --> 21:35.166
and because of you, Mama is dead!

21:59.916 --> 22:01.541
What are you going to do?

22:06.875 --> 22:10.833
Sofia, I'm gonna need you
to have faith in me.

22:18.041 --> 22:21.625
You're not to use it or answer it
unless I'm the one who's calling.

22:25.625 --> 22:27.166
You promise?

22:28.625 --> 22:30.250
<i>Wait for me here.</i>

22:30.333 --> 22:31.916
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

22:37.000 --> 22:38.291
Look at me.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.833
Nothing will happen to us.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.208
I swear to you.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.708
-Hakim.
-<i>Sofia</i>.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.458
Come and get me now, please.

24:14.541 --> 24:16.583
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>The police are looking for you.</i>

24:16.666 --> 24:19.333
-Are you all right?
-<i>I'm all right, don't worry.</i>

24:19.416 --> 24:21.750
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

24:21.833 --> 24:25.000
You know, I'm at the abandoned hotel
by Speikboden bend. You know it?

24:25.083 --> 24:26.041
<i>Yes, I-I got it.</i>

24:26.791 --> 24:28.125
Is your dad with you?

24:28.208 --> 24:30.041
I don't know where he is,
and I don't care.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.125
He's no longer my father.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.166
I don't want to have anything
to do with him again.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.083
Please, just come--

24:34.166 --> 24:35.875
Don't worry, I'm on my way.

24:35.958 --> 24:38.250
Please come fast. I can't wait.

24:48.083 --> 24:50.625
What do you mean it wasn't him?
They had a photo.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.291
They knew his face.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.000
And what exactly is a warning
supposed to do?

24:56.916 --> 24:58.333
Now you have to help me do it.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.458
Hello?

25:47.166 --> 25:48.208
Who did it?

25:59.333 --> 26:01.500
I have nothing to do
with this, I swear.

26:01.916 --> 26:02.958
They came here yesterday,

26:03.041 --> 26:04.875
they only stayed half an hour!

26:04.958 --> 26:06.833
I don't know anything.

26:06.916 --> 26:08.166
They'll kill me.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.041
I'll kill you as well,
but first I'll make you suffer like a pig.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.416
If you tell me what I want to know,
maybe you'll get to the hospital.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.583
It was Don Angelo who sent them.

26:16.666 --> 26:18.958
I didn't need you
to tell me that, dickhead.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.791
I want to know who did it!

26:21.875 --> 26:23.541
Marino Gallo.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.791
Oh Lord, I'm dying.

26:26.291 --> 26:28.541
Go on. I know there were two of them.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.041
My daughter saw them.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.916
Please, Santo, call an ambulance--

26:33.000 --> 26:33.833
The name!

26:37.916 --> 26:42.125
It's Rudi Crisarà… Rudi Crisarà.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.875
Don Angelo's new right-hand man.

26:45.916 --> 26:47.666
Oh Lord, I'm dying!

26:47.750 --> 26:49.750
You have just one way to be saved.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.041
Pray to God.

27:07.583 --> 27:08.416
Hakim!

27:09.375 --> 27:11.041
Hurry up. Let's go.

27:43.791 --> 27:44.791
Sofia?

27:46.291 --> 27:47.541
Sofia?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.333
Sofia!

28:01.666 --> 28:03.208
Sofia!

28:26.541 --> 28:27.833
Hang on, Sofi.

28:30.916 --> 28:32.541
Head down, Sofia!

28:39.333 --> 28:40.833
Hakim!

28:42.666 --> 28:44.541
Run, Sofi. Go!

28:45.166 --> 28:46.291
-I said run, now!
-Hakim…

28:46.375 --> 28:47.291
No!

28:49.583 --> 28:51.583
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

28:51.666 --> 28:52.500
Come here.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.416
Stop it.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.083
Shut up and I won't have to beat you.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.083
Calm down--

28:59.000 --> 29:00.833
What the fuck? Get your ass over here.

29:00.916 --> 29:02.750
That's it.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.458
Come on.
Now, let's give Uncle something--

29:09.541 --> 29:11.166
Where do you think you're going?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.625
Where do you think you're gonna go?

29:13.708 --> 29:14.916
Fuck!

29:15.000 --> 29:16.250
That's it!

29:19.541 --> 29:21.041
Get in there.

29:35.916 --> 29:38.583
Fucking brat, little bitch.

30:32.666 --> 30:33.541
No, Franzè!

30:33.625 --> 30:36.208
-Turn away, Sofia.
-No, Franzè. Don't do anything stupid!

30:36.291 --> 30:37.416
Don't do anything--

31:12.541 --> 31:14.375
Let's get out of here.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.791
About this Alto Adige business…

31:27.875 --> 31:29.791
I wish I'd been informed earlier.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.541
We are building this city.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.625
We can say it's our city.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.833
Please, sir. Let's avoid scandals.

31:46.375 --> 31:49.083
We have to be invisible,
even for the banks.

31:49.625 --> 31:51.333
Fuck off about the banks.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.875
We have some 40 building sites
in Northern Italy.

31:54.958 --> 31:57.833
We can't put everything at risk
for some sort of vendetta, sir.

32:03.458 --> 32:04.500
A…

32:05.916 --> 32:07.916
-fucking vendetta, asshole?
-Sorry--

32:10.750 --> 32:14.500
Franzè… he murdered your only brother.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.583
You should slit his throat
with your own hands.

32:19.666 --> 32:23.083
Instead, you sit behind a desk
counting money.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.208
Every time I look at you, I--

32:26.291 --> 32:28.708
What's that, huh? What's on your mind?

32:29.666 --> 32:32.500
That Franzè chose the wrong son
to be killed.

32:46.708 --> 32:48.458
We're gonna have to get help.

32:49.708 --> 32:52.833
It's only a flesh wound,
and we can't stop moving.

33:11.791 --> 33:12.875
Papa!

33:36.625 --> 33:38.791
There's some extra clothes there
in the back.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.458
You can change later.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.625
-I'll meet you over there.
-Okay.

33:42.708 --> 33:44.000
Sofi.

34:34.541 --> 34:36.791
-That's 17.30.
-<i>Bodies of Ingrid Gruber</i>

34:36.875 --> 34:40.458
<i>and her brother Patrick were found</i>
<i>beaten to death in this remote homestead</i>

34:40.541 --> 34:43.958
<i>where the woman lived with her husband</i>
<i>and daughter, who are now missing.</i>

34:44.041 --> 34:47.125
<i>Detectives cannot rule out</i>
<i>any possibilities, and it is feared that…</i>

34:49.166 --> 34:50.541
Papa, it's me.

35:30.250 --> 35:33.000
You can't drive. I'll take you.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.958
Where are we going?

35:43.041 --> 35:44.208
We're going to Milan.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.791
When will there be an end to this, Papa?

35:57.541 --> 36:01.166
It will be over when I finish something
I started more than 20 years ago.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.666
He's killed Vituzzo.

36:31.958 --> 36:34.750
The guy with the restaurant in Bolzano.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.166
He knew he was associated with us.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.541
Oh, God. No.

36:44.875 --> 36:47.625
This situation gets
more and more fucked up.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.041
Then he could track us. Will he?

36:58.166 --> 36:59.375
He isn't…

37:00.458 --> 37:02.750
a person looking to escape.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.375
He's an honorable man.

37:05.458 --> 37:09.458
Papa, why don't you drop
this "honor story"?

37:19.333 --> 37:22.666
Papa, do you really want to risk it all

37:23.416 --> 37:24.708
for one man?

37:24.791 --> 37:25.791
Michele.

37:29.791 --> 37:33.250
Forgive me for mistreating you today.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.291
But there are some things

37:37.375 --> 37:39.750
that you can never understand.

37:42.166 --> 37:44.250
Do you trust in me?

37:53.208 --> 37:55.750
Yes, I do. Of course I do, Papa.

37:57.083 --> 37:58.250
Slow down a bit.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.208
Park over there.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.291
Before we go to Milan,
there's one thing we have to do.

38:48.833 --> 38:50.375
Go ahead.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.833
<i>Dr. Ferrario.</i>

38:57.916 --> 39:01.291
<i>I still haven't thanked you</i>
<i>for the work you did with the faces.</i>

39:02.250 --> 39:04.041
The facial recognition, yes?

39:09.125 --> 39:11.708
Did you happen to find your acquaintance?

39:11.791 --> 39:13.291
We found him.

39:13.375 --> 39:16.791
But it seems, he's vanished again.

39:18.833 --> 39:21.208
It appears he's in Milan,

39:21.291 --> 39:23.333
and he's unhappy with us.

39:23.416 --> 39:25.833
The facial recognition
you did on the Internet…

39:26.666 --> 39:30.750
could you do that in real life,
using surveillance cameras?

39:32.041 --> 39:33.583
Uh, surveillance cameras?

39:34.208 --> 39:37.250
Yes. Throughout Milan.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.041
With access
to the public safety network,

39:40.125 --> 39:42.750
we can extend our search
to a greater number of people.

39:42.833 --> 39:43.916
Is that possible?

39:45.583 --> 39:48.041
I worked for the state
before opening up on my own.

39:49.125 --> 39:50.750
I know the right people.

39:51.875 --> 39:54.083
We would appreciate it greatly.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.458
And also for her too.

39:59.416 --> 40:01.083
I'm on it.

40:05.916 --> 40:09.000
<i>More bloodshed</i>
<i>in the hunt for Domenico Franzè,</i>

40:09.083 --> 40:11.958
<i>the 'Ndrangheta killer</i>
<i>on the run since last night.</i>

40:12.041 --> 40:15.250
<i>Three more deaths appear to be linked</i>
<i>to the criminal…</i>

40:15.333 --> 40:16.291
MILAN

40:16.375 --> 40:18.666
<i>…who is now the most wanted man</i>
<i>in Northern Italy.</i>

40:18.750 --> 40:22.708
<i>His daughter, Sofia, was seen</i>
<i>at a service station near Merano.</i>

40:23.291 --> 40:27.000
<i>The police consider Franzè to be armed</i>
<i>and very dangerous.</i>

40:39.541 --> 40:40.375
Pull over.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.250
Okay, wait for me here.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.208
COME HERE

42:05.458 --> 42:06.750
Pa, is it really painful?

42:06.833 --> 42:08.583
No, I just need
to breathe a little.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.166
Papa?

42:42.875 --> 42:43.958
Papa?

42:45.500 --> 42:46.875
Papa!

42:47.541 --> 42:49.541
Papa, answer. Can you hear me?

42:50.958 --> 42:52.708
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.458
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

43:24.458 --> 43:25.791
PHARMACY

43:42.625 --> 43:44.375
Hey, please open the door.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.625
Please, I need help.

43:49.708 --> 43:51.083
Where can I find the doctor?

43:55.500 --> 43:57.083
We can't help you, get out of here.

43:57.166 --> 43:59.208
-No, I need a doctor.
-Just go away.

43:59.291 --> 44:01.083
Let me in. I need to find a doctor.

44:01.166 --> 44:02.375
Leave now!

44:02.458 --> 44:03.916
Do you want all this?

44:08.916 --> 44:11.625
-Easy. Go easy.
-Right, that's right.

44:11.708 --> 44:12.916
Pa.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.041
You're gonna be okay.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.833
Come on, move him…

44:27.500 --> 44:30.125
Quick, quick, quick!

44:39.125 --> 44:40.291
There she is.

44:46.791 --> 44:48.125
Well done.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.583
<i>Hello, my love.</i>

44:53.958 --> 44:56.291
<i>If you're reading this letter,</i>
<i>it means I'm dead.</i>

44:58.041 --> 44:59.875
<i>But that doesn't matter.</i>

44:59.958 --> 45:02.500
<i>Because if I can say that I have lived,</i>

45:03.416 --> 45:04.958
<i>it's all thanks to you.</i>

45:09.083 --> 45:10.958
<i>You, my love… you saved my life.</i>

45:11.541 --> 45:13.916
<i>A life that didn't deserve to be saved.</i>

45:15.000 --> 45:17.416
<i>Because it was full of nothing more</i>
<i>than cruelty</i>

45:18.291 --> 45:19.291
<i>and violence.</i>

45:21.708 --> 45:23.541
<i>I didn't know what love was</i>

45:24.041 --> 45:26.458
<i>or the joy</i>
<i>of what it was like to be loved.</i>

45:27.041 --> 45:29.541
<i>I lived to kill and killed to live.</i>

45:30.625 --> 45:32.875
<i>I was just waiting for my turn to die</i>

45:32.958 --> 45:36.333
<i>because I could no longer see</i>
<i>the difference between life and death.</i>

45:37.916 --> 45:40.083
<i>I never expected that I would be saved.</i>

45:42.291 --> 45:43.500
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

45:45.666 --> 45:46.583
<i>Because even I,</i>

45:48.333 --> 45:49.791
<i>from the pit of hell,</i>

45:52.333 --> 45:53.791
<i>could still be blessed.</i>

45:55.708 --> 45:57.958
<i>I knew nothing about life,</i>

45:58.041 --> 45:59.291
<i>or about myself…</i>

46:00.583 --> 46:01.958
<i>until you came along.</i>

46:04.291 --> 46:06.875
<i>Your birth was my blessing.</i>

46:08.583 --> 46:09.583
<i>Sofia.</i>

46:10.416 --> 46:11.458
<i>My love.</i>

46:48.958 --> 46:49.833
Whoops.

47:04.333 --> 47:05.458
What's going on?

47:07.208 --> 47:08.208
You were right.

47:08.750 --> 47:10.916
Your father wants us
to keep looking for Franzè.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.583
He's so fucking predictable.

47:13.666 --> 47:17.000
Yes, he made me set up a much wider,
much more extended search than before.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.166
It's complex. It's illegal.

47:19.666 --> 47:20.833
And it'll cost you.

47:20.916 --> 47:22.958
It's incredibly costly.

47:23.041 --> 47:26.416
Especially because I'm gonna have to
bother a lot of people with the state.

47:31.625 --> 47:33.000
I could say he couldn't be found.

47:34.458 --> 47:35.750
No, he'd pick up on it.

47:37.083 --> 47:39.291
He always figures out what I do.

47:41.666 --> 47:44.208
Tell you what, let's do this.

47:44.291 --> 47:47.083
Give him whatever he wants
but keep me informed at all times.

47:52.041 --> 47:53.833
<i>I'm sorry it happened to you too.</i>

47:56.833 --> 47:58.541
To have to live this life.

48:09.291 --> 48:11.000
Pass me one of those.

48:16.541 --> 48:17.708
We have to get out of here,

48:17.791 --> 48:19.583
as soon as possible.

48:20.875 --> 48:23.916
We have a few positions,
all from last night.

48:26.583 --> 48:29.708
They're all
between Quarto Oggiaro and Bovisa.

48:29.791 --> 48:30.666
We've located them.

48:43.958 --> 48:47.208
We also located a girl
in an industrial area nearby.

48:47.291 --> 48:50.000
A warehouse that is a front
for illegal abortions.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.958
I'll leave this to you.

49:14.041 --> 49:16.375
Move those things over before I leave.

49:16.458 --> 49:18.750
Move those over. I'm in a rush.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.666
Okay. I'm going.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.625
Shut the door and let's go.

49:37.458 --> 49:39.291
KEYS, BATTERY, CONTROL UNIT

50:35.500 --> 50:37.625
Where's the man and the girl?

50:38.875 --> 50:40.458
Where are they?

51:42.916 --> 51:44.708
I'll kill you
just like your hot piece of--

51:56.166 --> 51:57.083
Stop.

51:57.708 --> 51:59.083
Stop right there!

52:07.916 --> 52:08.791
Hands up.

52:10.375 --> 52:11.416
Don't move!

52:32.416 --> 52:36.083
<i>Now that they've found us,</i>
<i>they won't stop until we're both dead.</i>

52:37.875 --> 52:38.875
SULFUR

52:38.958 --> 52:41.583
<i>That's why</i>
<i>we must make the first move, Sofia.</i>

52:42.333 --> 52:43.750
<i>We have no choice.</i>

52:44.458 --> 52:46.916
<i>Kill to not be killed.</i>

52:47.958 --> 52:50.208
<i>This is a lesson</i>
<i>I wouldn't have wanted to teach you.</i>

52:52.833 --> 52:55.958
<i>I have a precise plan</i>
<i>but I can't do it on my own.</i>

52:56.041 --> 52:57.166
<i>I need you.</i>

53:03.458 --> 53:04.541
Take this.

53:10.208 --> 53:11.416
What am I supposed to do now?

53:11.500 --> 53:13.125
Let your hand decide.

53:13.625 --> 53:16.958
It shouldn't feel foreign to you at all,
but like it was meant to be a part of you.

53:20.416 --> 53:23.250
If you're using a knife,
it means you're close to your opponent,

53:23.333 --> 53:24.875
therefore close to danger.

53:24.958 --> 53:26.291
To your death.

53:26.375 --> 53:30.208
Fear must be put aside
to leave room for action.

53:30.291 --> 53:32.500
You wouldn't have time for a second shot,

53:32.583 --> 53:34.208
so the first one must be lethal.

53:37.666 --> 53:39.333
Go on, try a position.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.083
No. No.

53:45.541 --> 53:47.666
Always point the knife
in front of you.

53:48.250 --> 53:49.458
You attack with the knife,

53:49.541 --> 53:50.666
you block with the knife.

53:51.916 --> 53:54.791
Stand diagonally.
Never offer your body to your opponent.

53:55.416 --> 53:58.208
Always keep moving,
use the other arm to keep your balance.

54:00.750 --> 54:02.375
If you hit him here on the flank…

54:05.750 --> 54:09.291
…he'll feel excruciating pain,
but most likely he'll survive.

54:10.666 --> 54:11.875
Hit here, the heart…

54:14.958 --> 54:17.250
The loss of consciousness
will be immediate.

54:17.833 --> 54:19.333
In three seconds, he'll be dead.

54:21.208 --> 54:23.541
But if you hit him right in the jugular…

54:26.458 --> 54:30.666
your victim will have 30 seconds
before suffocating in his own blood.

54:31.375 --> 54:34.416
The last face he sees will not be one
of someone who loves him,

54:35.333 --> 54:36.250
but yours.

54:39.416 --> 54:41.000
No revenge is crueler.

54:59.375 --> 55:00.666
I found it.

55:01.875 --> 55:05.000
Quadra Capital. Here are the blueprints
and layout of the building.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
They're on the website
of the architectural firm

55:08.583 --> 55:10.083
that did the interior design.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.208
Good job.

55:18.291 --> 55:19.875
You think it'll be successful?

55:22.083 --> 55:22.916
Yes.

55:25.583 --> 55:26.541
Then what?

55:30.166 --> 55:32.875
Well, I have a friend in South Africa.

55:32.958 --> 55:35.000
We can stay there in the beginning.

55:35.875 --> 55:37.208
You and I.

55:37.833 --> 55:38.666
Mm-hmm.

55:41.291 --> 55:43.041
I keep thinking about Mom.

55:46.291 --> 55:48.291
Why did I have to take that photo?

55:48.375 --> 55:50.500
It's all my fault, Sofia,

55:50.583 --> 55:52.583
because of the life I lived.

55:53.208 --> 55:54.583
Forgive me.

55:55.250 --> 55:57.000
Don't feel guilty about it, Papa.

55:57.833 --> 56:00.000
You were just trying to survive.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.250
You're like Buck.

56:04.541 --> 56:05.833
THE CALL OF THE WILD

56:05.916 --> 56:07.208
You've read it?

56:07.291 --> 56:09.083
Yeah, we read it in middle school.

56:13.291 --> 56:15.291
This book was your favorite?

56:18.125 --> 56:19.791
I bought it at a fair.

56:24.541 --> 56:26.166
The cover drew me in.

56:38.166 --> 56:41.166
I trust you. It'll be okay.

57:19.541 --> 57:21.458
You can't be here.

57:21.541 --> 57:23.250
What are you doing with your phone?

57:25.125 --> 57:27.750
-Excuse me. I got lost.
-What?

57:27.833 --> 57:29.625
I wanted to head
to the city center

57:29.708 --> 57:32.250
-but the sat nav wasn't working.
-Don't care.

57:32.333 --> 57:34.125
Just move it along.
You can exit over there.

57:34.208 --> 57:35.875
I'm sorry. I'll leave now.

57:43.250 --> 57:45.416
Okay, you'll tell me later.
Bye-bye.

57:53.416 --> 57:56.125
Keep your hands on the wheel
and drive to the garage.

58:04.458 --> 58:05.666
Take a left turn over there.

58:15.166 --> 58:16.916
Park all the way down to the left.

58:20.916 --> 58:22.625
Okay. Get out.

58:28.166 --> 58:29.333
Come here.

58:31.791 --> 58:32.791
Go on.

58:34.416 --> 58:36.541
Move. Turn around.

59:01.625 --> 59:02.875
The code.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.375
Unlock it.

59:06.166 --> 59:07.083
Unlock it.

59:39.291 --> 59:41.291
-What was that?
-What was that?

59:41.375 --> 59:42.458
The hell was that?

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:03.583
Stop there!

1:00:03.666 --> 1:00:05.208
Everybody stay calm.

1:00:05.291 --> 1:00:06.583
Just do what he says.

1:00:06.666 --> 1:00:09.166
-Stop, let him go.
-He's a dead man if you shoot!

1:00:11.125 --> 1:00:12.458
Put your gun on the ground.

1:00:23.833 --> 1:00:24.958
Let him go!

1:00:26.208 --> 1:00:27.416
I have nothing to do with this.

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:37.208
Kill me,
and your daughter will be next.

1:00:37.291 --> 1:00:39.125
Drop the gun!

1:00:40.041 --> 1:00:41.291
Drop the gun!

1:00:58.416 --> 1:00:59.875
Stop now!

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:06.791
Man down!

1:01:07.791 --> 1:01:09.416
Look out!

1:01:17.291 --> 1:01:18.416
Stay there!

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:20.291
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:23.166
You, don't move!

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:38.750
Run this way!

1:02:04.375 --> 1:02:05.916
Go, go, go! Go!

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:08.541
Back!

1:02:13.208 --> 1:02:14.375
Sofi, turn left!

1:02:19.125 --> 1:02:20.375
Go now!

1:02:31.208 --> 1:02:32.291
Get out of the way!

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:42.041
Focus, straight!

1:03:28.208 --> 1:03:30.166
It'll all be over soon enough.

1:04:17.583 --> 1:04:19.625
We got this today
from Michele's number.

1:04:21.250 --> 1:04:23.083
That piece of shit got him.

1:04:31.791 --> 1:04:33.916
There was a message sent with the photo.

1:04:35.625 --> 1:04:39.375
<i>You have an hour,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch, to turn yourself in</i>

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:41.750
<i>and confess to your crimes</i>
<i>over the last 30 years.</i>

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:58.416
<i>Give the names of all your affiliates,</i>
<i>political protectors, with evidence,</i>

1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:02.125
<i>and most important,</i>
<i>all the numbers to current bank accounts</i>

1:05:02.208 --> 1:05:04.875
<i>in Europe, London and South America,</i>

1:05:04.958 --> 1:05:07.791
<i>or I'll be forced to kill</i>
<i>another one of your sons.</i>

1:05:09.041 --> 1:05:12.875
<i>I want to hear the news on TV</i>
<i>before midnight tomorrow,</i>

1:05:12.958 --> 1:05:14.416
<i>or Michele is dead.</i>

1:05:15.375 --> 1:05:17.333
<i>But you do what I ask,</i>

1:05:17.416 --> 1:05:20.916
<i>and I'll let you know</i>
<i>where you can find him alive.</i>

1:05:23.458 --> 1:05:24.750
Call Ferrario.

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:34.375
<i>It's an abandoned rail yard.</i>

1:05:34.458 --> 1:05:37.375
<i>The cell tower</i>
<i>picked up the phone for a second.</i>

1:05:37.458 --> 1:05:40.000
Just enough time to send the photo
before it was turned off.

1:05:41.166 --> 1:05:42.583
But we have the position.

1:05:48.666 --> 1:05:51.166
Rudi, you must not fail me again.

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:23.375
Get out here.

1:06:23.458 --> 1:06:25.125
<i>Copy that, boss.</i>

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:00.208
There's the van.

1:07:04.166 --> 1:07:05.291
Let's get out of here.

1:07:29.750 --> 1:07:31.916
Mino, in the van.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:42.541
Michele.

1:07:44.250 --> 1:07:46.166
Michele, it's me, Rudi.

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:48.583
I came to free you.

1:07:54.083 --> 1:07:55.500
Behind the van!

1:07:59.833 --> 1:08:01.625
Where the fuck is he shooting from?

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:02.708
You can't hide forever.

1:08:02.791 --> 1:08:03.875
Run!

1:08:12.208 --> 1:08:13.708
Get back, get back!

1:08:13.791 --> 1:08:15.041
That son of a…

1:08:22.541 --> 1:08:23.666
Where the fuck is he?

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:25.875
-Here! I see him.
-Where is he?

1:08:25.958 --> 1:08:27.250
Damn! Fuck.

1:08:27.333 --> 1:08:28.916
-He's comin' out!
-Kill him!

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.083
Kill that son of a bitch!

1:08:59.625 --> 1:09:01.000
Fuck.

1:10:42.541 --> 1:10:44.291
Do you really believe

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:46.416
for a second Don Angelo

1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:49.208
would give up his fucking empire
to save his own kid?

1:10:49.291 --> 1:10:51.500
My family was innocent.

1:10:57.250 --> 1:10:59.208
People like you and me…

1:10:59.291 --> 1:11:01.416
We shouldn't have a family.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:50.333
Please.

1:11:52.375 --> 1:11:53.875
Please.

1:11:59.791 --> 1:12:00.666
Please.

1:12:12.625 --> 1:12:15.541
I beg of you, a sip of water.
I'm dying of thirst.

1:12:30.458 --> 1:12:31.416
Thank you.

1:12:33.041 --> 1:12:35.166
I'm so sorry for what happened to you,
it was terrible.

1:12:35.250 --> 1:12:37.041
You did it, asshole.

1:12:37.125 --> 1:12:40.208
You did it
with your whole family of mafia maniacs.

1:12:40.291 --> 1:12:42.250
It was all my father.

1:12:42.333 --> 1:12:43.291
Sofia.

1:12:44.333 --> 1:12:46.041
Your name is Sofia, isn't it?

1:12:46.750 --> 1:12:49.541
I swear I only found out afterwards
what my father had done.

1:12:49.625 --> 1:12:50.875
I swear if I had known before--

1:12:50.958 --> 1:12:53.166
You didn't know
that your father was a mafioso?

1:12:55.583 --> 1:12:56.750
You tell me.

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:59.083
Did you even know
who your father really was?

1:13:03.458 --> 1:13:05.416
I know who my dad is.

1:13:08.083 --> 1:13:11.333
I don't know what he told you,
but it's all bullshit.

1:13:13.250 --> 1:13:14.583
Shut the hell up.

1:13:14.666 --> 1:13:17.375
Listen to me. You don't know anything.

1:13:17.458 --> 1:13:20.083
You think your dad's on some kind
of righteous crusade, but he isn't.

1:13:20.166 --> 1:13:21.500
We're the victims, the Lo Biancos.

1:13:21.583 --> 1:13:22.833
That's bullshit!

1:13:23.458 --> 1:13:25.625
Your father murdered my brother.

1:13:26.666 --> 1:13:29.208
He's killed dozens of people, Sofia.

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:33.083
He's an inhumane being, a criminal.

1:13:34.666 --> 1:13:36.291
I don't think you can even fathom…

1:13:38.916 --> 1:13:40.583
But you are different.

1:13:40.666 --> 1:13:42.833
Your future is not yet written.

1:13:42.916 --> 1:13:45.791
It's the future you imagined
until three days ago.

1:13:45.875 --> 1:13:47.625
To have that gone forever…

1:13:48.500 --> 1:13:50.375
This is not your war, Sofia.

1:13:50.458 --> 1:13:51.916
You're not a Franzè.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.291
Your father had no choice.

1:13:54.375 --> 1:13:56.791
You did, but it's now or never.

1:13:58.416 --> 1:13:59.583
Please let me go.

1:13:59.666 --> 1:14:02.083
A-And you escape, save yourself.

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:04.375
Please, just untie me.

1:14:10.250 --> 1:14:11.666
Sofia?

1:14:11.750 --> 1:14:12.875
Sofia, please.

1:14:12.958 --> 1:14:14.833
Please, just let me go, Sofia!

1:14:14.916 --> 1:14:16.416
Sofia, please!

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:19.916
How many more people have to die, Sofia?
Oh, please!

1:14:35.666 --> 1:14:36.750
Hello?

1:14:37.833 --> 1:14:39.458
Hey, sweetheart. It's me.

1:14:41.458 --> 1:14:44.000
Is everything all right?
You sound strange.

1:14:45.333 --> 1:14:47.208
Things didn't go well, I'm sorry.

1:14:47.291 --> 1:14:49.166
<i>Our plan didn't work out.</i>

1:14:49.250 --> 1:14:50.625
It's Franzè.

1:14:50.708 --> 1:14:53.541
He's making the call
from a cell in Agrate Brianza.

1:14:53.625 --> 1:14:54.625
He's on the move.

1:14:55.416 --> 1:14:56.750
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1:14:56.833 --> 1:14:58.375
What is going on, Papa?

1:14:59.916 --> 1:15:01.125
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1:15:02.458 --> 1:15:03.500
You okay?

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:04.458
The voice is feminine.

1:15:04.541 --> 1:15:06.458
Geolocated in a fixed position.

1:15:06.541 --> 1:15:07.708
That's his daughter.

1:15:08.333 --> 1:15:09.416
Let's get moving.

1:15:10.166 --> 1:15:12.416
Two squads. One for Franzè,
and one for his daughter.

1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:13.791
<i>Talk to me, Pa.</i>

1:15:14.625 --> 1:15:16.458
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1:15:19.208 --> 1:15:21.375
<i>But I have no choice now.</i>

1:15:21.458 --> 1:15:22.750
<i>Please come.</i>

1:15:22.833 --> 1:15:24.833
Just come back. Do it for me.

1:15:28.833 --> 1:15:30.916
<i>I can't, Sofi.</i>

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:34.833
You knew, didn't you,
that it would never work out?

1:15:37.958 --> 1:15:40.625
<i>But I hoped it would</i>
<i>for your sake.</i>

1:15:41.541 --> 1:15:43.000
Now, what are we gonna do?

1:15:47.833 --> 1:15:50.291
<i>You don't have to do anything now,</i>
<i>my love.</i>

1:15:52.208 --> 1:15:55.208
<i>I'd hoped there could be another way.</i>

1:15:57.875 --> 1:15:59.083
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

1:16:10.125 --> 1:16:11.750
<i>And now, the only way to be safe…</i>

1:16:14.041 --> 1:16:17.750
<i>…is to make sure Don Angelo disappears</i>
<i>forever from the face of the Earth.</i>

1:16:22.958 --> 1:16:24.958
<i>I have to do it now. Understand?</i>

1:16:26.875 --> 1:16:29.875
What are you saying?
I don't understand anymore.

1:16:34.333 --> 1:16:36.416
<i>I had changed, Sofi.</i>

1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:37.791
<i>I had changed.</i>

1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:43.250
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1:16:43.333 --> 1:16:45.916
<i>And now I know</i>
<i>you can survive without me.</i>

1:17:00.083 --> 1:17:02.208
You know what will happen
if you kill me, don't you?

1:17:05.833 --> 1:17:08.625
And how they will deal with
your bitch of a daughter?

1:17:11.958 --> 1:17:13.666
You should never have touched my family.

1:17:13.750 --> 1:17:15.041
You should've left them in peace.

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:47.000
<i>Please, Papa.</i>

1:17:47.083 --> 1:17:50.458
I beg you. I beg you.

1:17:50.541 --> 1:17:54.375
We were supposed to go to South Africa.
You know you made a promise to me too.

1:17:54.458 --> 1:17:57.000
<i>We were gonna go, just me and you.</i>

1:17:57.083 --> 1:17:58.666
<i>Please. </i>

1:18:00.791 --> 1:18:02.625
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

1:18:04.791 --> 1:18:06.500
<i>I've had wonderful years.</i>

1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:09.416
<i>I had a family.</i>

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:10.583
<i>I had you.</i>

1:18:12.375 --> 1:18:13.791
<i>A miracle.</i>

1:18:16.666 --> 1:18:18.458
Put your hands up!

1:18:18.541 --> 1:18:20.708
Hands up, I said!

1:18:20.791 --> 1:18:23.416
<i>But it's only right</i>
<i>that we settle the score now.</i>

1:18:35.666 --> 1:18:37.041
Papa!

1:18:38.250 --> 1:18:39.625
Papa!

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:11.791
Hands up!
I said, put your hands up!

1:19:19.083 --> 1:19:21.458
-Clear.
-All clear.

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:23.666
Hello, Sofia.

1:19:25.583 --> 1:19:27.125
Here she is. I found her.

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:31.958
Stand up.

1:19:34.916 --> 1:19:36.833
Don't worry, it's all over.

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:02.791
Franzè, come with me.

1:21:10.958 --> 1:21:13.250
Well, thanks, but I don't like chocolate.

1:21:14.541 --> 1:21:15.375
How was your stay?

1:21:15.458 --> 1:21:17.000
What do you want?

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:20.750
I spoke with the judge in your case.

1:21:20.833 --> 1:21:22.583
There are no charges against you at all.

1:21:22.666 --> 1:21:24.208
In the proceedings, you'll be acquitted.

1:21:25.458 --> 1:21:27.041
And it makes me really happy.

1:21:27.125 --> 1:21:29.291
Because you've been
at the mercy of a madman,

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:30.750
you've been abused.

1:21:34.750 --> 1:21:37.166
You and I, we have the same destiny.

1:21:38.375 --> 1:21:40.916
We've been made to pay
for the sins of our fathers.

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.666
Now we're liberated.

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:44.625
Is that what you came
all the way here for?

1:21:49.875 --> 1:21:50.875
No.

1:21:52.833 --> 1:21:55.708
I wanted to say that,
as far as I'm concerned,

1:21:55.791 --> 1:21:57.833
the war between the Lo Bianco and Franzè…

1:21:57.916 --> 1:21:59.166
it's time to finally end.

1:22:00.791 --> 1:22:02.458
Now we're patched up.

1:22:04.541 --> 1:22:08.458
You, before long, will come of age.

1:22:08.541 --> 1:22:11.750
You'll get out of here
and you can have a fresh start.

1:22:14.583 --> 1:22:15.875
If you ever need any help,

1:22:16.666 --> 1:22:18.500
why don't you come and visit me?

1:22:19.083 --> 1:22:21.208
You know,
I'd really love to give you a hand.

1:22:33.375 --> 1:22:34.958
What's the plan this time?

1:22:37.958 --> 1:22:40.166
I'm not sure about this.

1:22:41.375 --> 1:22:43.208
I want to obliterate her.

1:22:43.291 --> 1:22:46.625
I want her to die
with a rope squeezed around her neck,

1:22:46.708 --> 1:22:48.333
just like my father.

1:22:57.250 --> 1:22:59.208
<i>"And closely akin to the visions</i>

1:22:59.291 --> 1:23:02.125
<i>was the call still sounding</i>
<i>in the depths of the forest."</i>

1:23:06.541 --> 1:23:10.291
<i>"It filled him with a great unrest</i>
<i>and strange desires."</i>

1:23:10.375 --> 1:23:11.583
THE CALL OF THE WILD

1:23:11.666 --> 1:23:14.916
<i>"It caused him to feel a vague,</i>
<i>sweet gladness,</i>

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.166
<i>and he was aware of wild yearnings</i>

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:21.791
<i>and stirrings for he knew not what."</i>

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:29.125
<i>"He would crouch for hours,</i>
<i>as if in concealment,</i>

1:23:29.208 --> 1:23:32.166
<i>behind fungus-covered trunks</i>
<i>of fallen trees,</i>

1:23:33.708 --> 1:23:36.125
<i>wide-eyed and wide-eared</i>

1:23:36.208 --> 1:23:39.541
<i>to all that moved and sounded about him."</i>

1:23:41.416 --> 1:23:43.583
<i>"It might be, lying thus,</i>

1:23:43.666 --> 1:23:47.208
<i>that he hoped to surprise</i>
<i>this call he could not understand."</i>

1:23:49.041 --> 1:23:51.833
<i>"But he did not know</i>
<i>why he did these various things."</i>

1:23:52.666 --> 1:23:54.333
<i>"He was impelled to do them…</i>

1:23:56.916 --> 1:23:58.916
<i>and did not reason about them at all."</i>

1:24:20.333 --> 1:24:21.166
Talk to me.

1:24:23.958 --> 1:24:25.125
She's not here.

1:24:25.208 --> 1:24:26.875
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>she's not there?</i>

1:24:26.958 --> 1:24:28.250
I said I wanted her dead.

1:24:28.333 --> 1:24:30.875
<i>Well, she's not here.</i>
<i>She must've run away.</i>

1:24:32.833 --> 1:24:34.958
Okay, I-I'll call you back.

1:24:43.291 --> 1:24:44.375
Sofia.

1:24:45.958 --> 1:24:47.916
What's up? Something into you?

1:24:52.166 --> 1:24:53.333
How did you manage to get in?

1:24:58.791 --> 1:25:01.375
With your business card
and a smile.

1:25:02.083 --> 1:25:04.958
I bet when it comes to girls in here,
I'm not the first.

1:25:07.583 --> 1:25:12.125
I imagine you've come, uh,
looking for the help I promised.

1:25:16.166 --> 1:25:17.333
Now what?

1:25:23.125 --> 1:25:25.833
Your truce is a bust, Michele Lo Bianco.

1:25:26.666 --> 1:25:28.208
And why is that? A brag?

1:25:31.583 --> 1:25:33.791
For it to work, it takes two of us.

1:25:38.791 --> 1:25:40.500
And the Franzès' rule hasn't ended.

1:25:50.916 --> 1:25:54.500
<i>"Kill or be killed,</i>
<i>this is the law."</i>

1:25:54.583 --> 1:25:57.708
<i>"Showing mercy</i>
<i>was just a sign of weakness."</i>
