00:47.644 --> 00:50.776
Our last rainy season.

00:50.778 --> 00:52.876
Just think, Pastuzo,

00:52.878 --> 00:55.842
this time next month
we'll be in London.

00:55.844 --> 00:58.708
Where the rivers run
with marmalade

00:58.710 --> 01:01.642
and the streets are paved
with bread.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.875
Did you read the book
about London?

01:03.877 --> 01:05.010
I skimmed it.

01:05.012 --> 01:07.077
Oh, Pastuzo.

01:07.079 --> 01:09.908
Well, reading makes me sleepy.

01:09.910 --> 01:12.643
But any city that can
come up with this

01:12.645 --> 01:14.843
is all right by me.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.478
Ooh, Pastuzo, look!

01:20.812 --> 01:23.412
It's... It's a cub.

01:23.878 --> 01:25.110
Lucy!

01:25.112 --> 01:27.144
Lower me down.

01:27.146 --> 01:29.210
Be careful.

01:40.977 --> 01:43.375
Lower, Pastuzo. Lower.

02:00.410 --> 02:02.077
Lucy?

02:02.079 --> 02:03.609
Lucy!

02:03.611 --> 02:07.508
I'm afraid we're not going
to London after all.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.142
Why not?

02:09.144 --> 02:12.410
We've got a cub to raise.

02:12.412 --> 02:15.177
- What's he like?
- Rather small.

02:16.311 --> 02:17.944
And rather sneezy.

02:19.544 --> 02:21.909
But he likes his marmalade.

02:21.911 --> 02:24.276
That's a good sign.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.177
Oh, yes, Pastuzo.

02:26.179 --> 02:31.845
If we look after this bear,
I have a feeling he'll go far.

02:51.378 --> 02:52.876
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy.</i>

02:52.878 --> 02:55.709
<i>I hope all is well
in the Home for Retired Bears.</i>

02:55.711 --> 02:59.110
<i>Life in London has been
better than ever this summer.</i>

02:59.112 --> 03:02.742
<i>I've really got to grips
with how things work.</i>

03:07.478 --> 03:11.143
<i>And it seems there's something
new to do every day.</i>

03:11.145 --> 03:12.542
- Guess what, Paddington?
- Hmm?

03:12.544 --> 03:14.475
The steam fair
is coming to town.

03:14.477 --> 03:15.609
I'm going along tonight
to write about it

03:15.611 --> 03:16.943
- in my newspaper.
- Ooh.

03:16.945 --> 03:18.842
Who's going to want
to read about that?

03:18.844 --> 03:21.609
Everyone. They travel the
world in an old steam train.

03:21.611 --> 03:23.408
- I thought you'd love it.
- I do.

03:23.410 --> 03:25.742
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Not cool.

03:25.744 --> 03:27.676
- Why don't we all go?
- Good idea.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.476
Your father's a dab hand
at the coconut shy.

03:29.478 --> 03:31.843
"Bullseye Brown"
they used to call him.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.777
Not anymore. Coconuts are
a young man's game.

03:33.779 --> 03:36.542
Well, I think you're in great
shape for a man your age,

03:36.544 --> 03:38.409
- Mr. Brown.
- Ah, thank you, Paddington.

03:38.411 --> 03:40.476
Hang on,
how old do you think I am?

03:40.478 --> 03:43.208
Oh, er, about 80.

03:43.210 --> 03:45.408
- 80?
- At least.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.842
- Just a minute, young bear.
- Hmm?

03:47.844 --> 03:50.676
Thought I told you
to wash behind your ears.

03:50.678 --> 03:51.943
Oh, but I did, Mrs. Bird.
I...

03:51.945 --> 03:53.910
I wonder how
that got in there.

03:55.145 --> 03:57.376
<i>I really feel at home
in Windsor Gardens.</i>

03:57.378 --> 03:58.542
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle.</i>

03:58.544 --> 04:00.576
Good morning, Paddington.

04:00.578 --> 04:02.676
- I brought you breakfast.
- Thank you.

04:02.678 --> 04:05.309
Your sandwiches always
put me in a good mood.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.676
Morning, Doctor Jafri.

04:06.678 --> 04:09.010
You haven't forgotten
your keys, have you?

04:09.012 --> 04:10.975
Keys? Keys!

04:10.977 --> 04:12.110
Oh. Oh!

04:12.112 --> 04:13.442
Well caught.

04:13.444 --> 04:15.441
- Thank you, Paddington.
- You're welcome.

04:15.443 --> 04:17.142
Glorious day, Colonel.

04:17.144 --> 04:19.942
Is it?
How absolutely thrilling.

04:19.944 --> 04:21.675
How was your date,
Miss Kitts?

04:21.677 --> 04:23.909
Well, he wasn't the one,
but you know what they say.

04:23.911 --> 04:26.509
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Exactly.

04:26.511 --> 04:27.812
Thank you.

04:31.012 --> 04:33.643
- Morning, Paddington.
- Morning, Mr. Barnes.

04:33.645 --> 04:36.009
- Bye, Paddington.
- <i>Au revoir, mademoiselle.</i>

04:36.011 --> 04:37.743
Right, test me.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.509
What's the quickest way
from Baker Street to Big Ben?

04:40.511 --> 04:41.710
Ah, an easy one.

04:41.712 --> 04:43.809
Turn right
onto Portman Square...

04:43.811 --> 04:46.510
<i>Everyone has
been so kind and welcoming</i>

04:46.512 --> 04:49.175
<i>even though they're very busy.</i>

04:49.177 --> 04:52.375
<i>Mrs. Brown is planning to
swim to France.</i>

04:52.377 --> 04:54.608
<i>It seems an awful lot
of hard work</i>

04:54.610 --> 04:56.177
<i>when you can go by boat</i>

04:56.179 --> 04:58.743
<i>or plane or even train.
But that's not the point.</i>

04:58.745 --> 05:00.509
<i>She's been cooped up
all summer</i>

05:00.511 --> 05:03.209
<i>illustrating a series
of adventure stories</i>

05:03.211 --> 05:06.442
<i>and has decided
she wants one of her own.</i>

05:06.444 --> 05:09.109
Whoo-hoo!

05:09.111 --> 05:11.776
<i>Judy has been
suffering from a broken heart.</i>

05:11.778 --> 05:15.208
I'm dumped? I think you'll
find you're dumped, Tony!

05:15.210 --> 05:17.777
<i>Her first
reaction was to become a nun.</i>

05:17.779 --> 05:19.309
<i>But she soon got over that</i>

05:19.311 --> 05:22.009
<i>and has thrown herself
into a new hobby.</i>

05:22.011 --> 05:24.242
<i>She found an old
printing press at school</i>

05:24.244 --> 05:27.475
<i>and is starting a newspaper
with no boys.</i>

05:27.477 --> 05:29.775
Now all we need is some news.

05:29.777 --> 05:31.176
<i>Jonathan is joining her</i>

05:31.178 --> 05:32.575
<i>at big school this year.</i>

05:32.577 --> 05:33.976
<i>He spent the holidays</i>

05:33.978 --> 05:36.176
<i>building a fully-working
steam engine,</i>

05:36.178 --> 05:38.542
<i>but I'm not supposed
to talk about that</i>

05:38.544 --> 05:40.476
<i>as it's "not cool."</i>

05:40.478 --> 05:42.042
<i>He's got a whole new look,</i>

05:42.044 --> 05:45.408
<i>and if anyone asks,
he's now called J-Dog,</i>

05:45.410 --> 05:48.079
<i>and he's definitely not
into steam trains.</i>

05:49.344 --> 05:51.909
<i>But Mr. Brown has been
busiest of all.</i>

05:51.911 --> 05:54.308
<i>He recently had a surprise
at work.</i>

05:54.310 --> 05:55.975
I am delighted
to announce,

05:55.977 --> 05:59.308
our new Head of Risk Analysis
will be

05:59.310 --> 06:01.375
Mr. Steve Visby.

06:03.445 --> 06:05.208
<i>And
this has prompted</i>

06:05.210 --> 06:08.642
<i>what Mrs. Bird calls "a
full-blown midlife crisis."</i>

06:08.644 --> 06:11.509
<i>It involves
blending his food,</i>

06:11.511 --> 06:13.875
<i>painting his hair,</i>

06:13.877 --> 06:16.808
<i>and engaging in a process
called "Chakrabatics."</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:20.208
Open your mind
and your legs will follow.

06:21.677 --> 06:25.076
- Thank you, Paddington.
- Keep up the good work.

06:25.078 --> 06:28.274
<i>Oh, Aunt Lucy, you sent me
to London to find a home,</i>

06:28.276 --> 06:31.242
<i>and it's worked out better
than I ever imagined.</i>

06:31.244 --> 06:32.842
<i>I have a wonderful family.</i>

06:34.011 --> 06:36.141
<i>And have made friends
in all sorts of places.</i>

06:36.143 --> 06:38.042
Here, boy.

06:38.044 --> 06:39.644
There you go, Wolfie.

06:41.045 --> 06:44.409
<i>I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased.</i>

06:44.411 --> 06:46.809
<i>Lots of love from Paddington.</i>

06:46.811 --> 06:48.376
Mr. Gruber?

06:48.378 --> 06:50.642
Ah, Mr. Brown, come in.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.876
I just had a visit
from Madame Kozlova

06:53.878 --> 06:55.108
who runs the fair.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.743
Oh, yes?

06:56.745 --> 06:59.476
They were having a clear out
and found all these old crates

06:59.478 --> 07:01.743
stuffed full with memory-bilia
they thought

07:01.745 --> 07:03.809
- had been lost forever.
- Oh!

07:03.811 --> 07:05.475
She asked me
if I would sell it

07:05.477 --> 07:07.043
for them while
they're in town.

07:07.045 --> 07:10.077
And it struck me there might
be something in here

07:10.079 --> 07:11.942
for your auntie's birthday.

07:11.944 --> 07:13.476
Oh, good idea.

07:14.812 --> 07:17.009
Ah, look at this!

07:18.777 --> 07:20.943
It's very nice, Mr. Gruber,
but...

07:20.945 --> 07:23.442
I know, I know,
it has to be perfect.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.910
Well,
since Uncle Pastuzo died,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.875
I'm the only relative
she's got left.

07:26.877 --> 07:29.408
And it isn't every day
a bear turns 100.

07:29.410 --> 07:31.675
Quite so. Ah!

07:31.677 --> 07:34.609
How about these rolling shoes?

07:34.611 --> 07:36.576
Please, Mr. Gruber,
be serious.

07:36.578 --> 07:39.643
Perhaps your auntie's
rolling days are behind her.

07:39.645 --> 07:41.975
I think you might be right.

07:41.977 --> 07:44.243
Oh, what's this?

07:44.245 --> 07:47.276
Ah, that must be
the popping book.

07:47.278 --> 07:48.910
Very interesting.

07:48.912 --> 07:49.977
Really?

07:49.979 --> 07:52.575
You see, Madame Kozlova's
great-grandmother,

07:52.577 --> 07:54.109
who started the fair,

07:54.111 --> 07:56.542
was also a brilliant artist.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.108
And every time
they visited a new city,

07:59.110 --> 08:01.708
she made a popping book
to remember it by.

08:01.710 --> 08:02.642
Oh!

08:02.644 --> 08:04.911
And this is London.

08:10.544 --> 08:13.811
Oh, Mr. Gruber,
it's wonderful.

08:14.879 --> 08:17.942
Aunt Lucy always dreamed
of coming to London

08:17.944 --> 08:19.576
and never had the chance.

08:19.578 --> 08:21.810
But if she saw this,

08:21.812 --> 08:24.643
it would be like
she were finally here.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.375
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

08:34.376 --> 08:35.779
Paddington!

08:39.376 --> 08:40.711
Oh!

08:46.176 --> 08:47.842
Come with me, Aunt Lucy.

08:47.844 --> 08:53.710
Oh, yes, please.
I want to see everything.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.342
Get all
your racing news right here.

08:56.344 --> 09:00.578
- Well, what do you think?
- It's wonderful.

09:02.978 --> 09:04.376
All aboard.

09:04.378 --> 09:08.276
- One and a half bears, please.
- Mind your step, madam.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.478
What a polite young man.

09:13.245 --> 09:15.445
What a polite young pigeon.

09:25.644 --> 09:30.778
Oh, Paddington, you've made
an old bear so very happy.

09:32.511 --> 09:34.511
This is perfect.

09:35.277 --> 09:37.341
- Oh.
- Huh?

09:37.343 --> 09:39.075
We have a snag.

09:39.077 --> 09:40.643
Do we?

09:40.645 --> 09:43.642
You see, this popping book
is the only one of its kind,

09:43.644 --> 09:46.241
and they want rather
a lot of money for it.

09:46.243 --> 09:50.274
Oh, well, Mrs. Bird found this
coin in my ear at breakfast.

09:50.276 --> 09:51.974
Perhaps there's more.

09:51.976 --> 09:54.608
It would take more
than an earful, Mr. Brown.

09:54.610 --> 09:58.242
I'm afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins.

09:58.244 --> 09:59.543
Oh.

09:59.545 --> 10:01.676
Let's take another look
at the monkey.

10:01.678 --> 10:03.476
I think he's super-duper.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.908
Oh!

10:05.910 --> 10:07.675
I can fix that.

10:07.677 --> 10:09.941
That's very kind, Mr. Gruber,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.709
but Aunt Lucy did so much
for me when I was a cub,

10:12.711 --> 10:16.108
and this could be my way
of saying thank you.

10:16.110 --> 10:19.643
I'm going to get a job
and buy that book.

10:19.645 --> 10:21.642
Back in a few minutes,
Paddington.

10:21.644 --> 10:24.712
- Ciao ciao.
- Ciao ciao, Mr. Giuseppe.

10:26.311 --> 10:30.375
Good afternoon. Welcome to
Giuseppe's grooming salon.

10:30.377 --> 10:32.141
What can I do for you
today, sir?

10:32.143 --> 10:34.142
A shave? A light pomade?

10:34.144 --> 10:35.341
Or is it just a brush?

10:36.911 --> 10:38.075
Quick trim, barber.

10:38.077 --> 10:40.276
Oh, I'm not the barber.
I just tidy up.

10:40.278 --> 10:41.742
That's all I want.

10:41.744 --> 10:44.076
Tidy up the back and sides,
nothing off the top.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.408
Yes, but...

10:45.410 --> 10:47.608
No buts.
Come on, man, chop-chop.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.544
If you say so, sir.

10:53.011 --> 10:54.242
Hmm.

10:54.244 --> 10:55.478
Ah.

10:58.011 --> 10:59.810
Hmm...

10:59.812 --> 11:02.344
Oh. Whoa!

11:23.144 --> 11:25.476
Giuseppe's?

11:25.478 --> 11:29.008
Would you mind
if I call you back?

11:29.010 --> 11:32.811
I think I may be about to
shave a customer.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.978
Oh, thank goodness.

11:40.511 --> 11:43.209
Just putting you on hold.

11:45.176 --> 11:46.676
But I don't want to.

11:46.678 --> 11:48.242
It's only a
haircut, Nelson.

11:48.244 --> 11:49.911
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.409
Come in. Take a seat.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.478
We'll go somewhere else.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.077
Oh, that's not good.

12:04.011 --> 12:06.512
Oh... Um...

12:09.977 --> 12:10.977
No.

12:11.977 --> 12:12.977
Um...

12:13.744 --> 12:14.744
Ah.

12:22.378 --> 12:24.975
Just giving you
some product, sir.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.311
Ah, jolly good. Carry on.

12:28.643 --> 12:31.276
All done.

12:31.278 --> 12:34.943
I must say, it's turned out
a lot better than I expected.

12:39.511 --> 12:42.309
What... What the devil's that?

12:42.311 --> 12:44.611
It's, er, marmalade.

12:45.177 --> 12:46.775
Marmalade?

12:46.777 --> 12:48.874
Hairy marmalade.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.541
Well, get it off!

12:50.543 --> 12:52.874
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

12:52.876 --> 12:55.842
Oh, yuck!
What is the matter with you?

12:55.844 --> 12:58.509
- Paddington!
- Mr. Giuseppe. I can explain.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.309
It's really not as bad
as it looks.

13:04.477 --> 13:06.808
Have you ever been fired,
Mr. Brown?

13:06.810 --> 13:09.176
Well, no,
but are you quite sure

13:09.178 --> 13:11.543
you're ready for
the workplace, Paddington?

13:11.545 --> 13:14.008
It's a tough,
competitive world out there,

13:14.010 --> 13:16.275
and I worry
a good-natured little bear

13:16.277 --> 13:17.774
might get trampled underfoot.

13:17.776 --> 13:20.007
He's right, you know?
You can't trust anyone.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.308
That's why
I'm doing my newspaper alone.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.142
Darling,
is this about Tony?

13:24.144 --> 13:25.275
No!

13:25.277 --> 13:26.807
Everything is about Tony.

13:26.809 --> 13:28.041
And the only reason no-one's
helping with your paper

13:28.043 --> 13:29.343
is because it's so lame.

13:29.345 --> 13:30.608
Well, at least
I'm not pretending

13:30.610 --> 13:32.076
to be someone I'm not.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.508
Nor am I. G-Man.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.442
- J-Dog.
- Spud bounce.

13:35.444 --> 13:36.975
But Aunt Lucy said,

13:36.977 --> 13:39.309
"If we're kind and polite,
the world will be right."

13:39.311 --> 13:41.109
At least
someone's making sense.

13:41.111 --> 13:44.142
Sorry. You're kind, Mr. Brown,
and you made it to the top.

13:44.144 --> 13:47.008
I'm nowhere near the top.
I peaked in the middle.

13:47.010 --> 13:48.276
Now my hair's gone grey,

13:48.278 --> 13:50.841
my belly's popped out,
and I've started to creak.

13:52.244 --> 13:53.909
Oh, doesn't that man live in
the big house on the corner?

13:53.911 --> 13:55.676
It's Phoenix Buchanan.

13:55.678 --> 13:57.408
Dad's 'celebrity' client.

13:57.410 --> 13:59.541
He's one of
our Platinum Club members.

13:59.543 --> 14:01.908
And a very famous actor.

14:01.910 --> 14:03.608
Or used to be.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.109
Now he just does
dog food commercials.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.441
Mrs. Bird doesn't like him

14:07.443 --> 14:09.242
because he can never remember
her name.

14:09.244 --> 14:10.543
Now then,
simmer down, simmer...

14:10.545 --> 14:12.142
All right, little bit more.

14:13.277 --> 14:14.807
That's enough.

14:14.809 --> 14:18.543
I'm sorry, I'm at my worst
tonight. I really am. I am

14:18.545 --> 14:21.709
tickled the deepest shade
of shrimp

14:21.711 --> 14:23.576
to have been asked here
tonight

14:23.578 --> 14:26.008
to open this
wonderful old steam fair.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.108
But you know,

14:27.110 --> 14:29.241
when Madame Kozlova created
this thing

14:29.243 --> 14:30.809
all those years ago,

14:30.811 --> 14:33.808
she most certainly was not
thinking of people like me,

14:33.810 --> 14:34.975
whatever I am,

14:34.977 --> 14:38.409
'VIP, ' 'celebrity.'
I hate all that stuff.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.609
No, no... 'West End legend, '

14:40.611 --> 14:41.875
that's another one.

14:41.877 --> 14:45.376
No, no, she was thinking
of you guys, huh?

14:45.378 --> 14:46.541
The ordinary people.

14:46.543 --> 14:49.576
So, I'm gonna ask
one of you to

14:49.578 --> 14:51.309
come up here
and open the fair.

14:51.311 --> 14:52.841
Volunteers? Anyone.

14:52.843 --> 14:53.975
Me. Me.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.175
Eeny, meeny, miney...

14:57.776 --> 14:58.941
...bear!

14:58.943 --> 15:01.741
Let's have the young bear.
Why not?

15:01.743 --> 15:04.441
- Come, come, young ursine.
- Thank you.

15:04.443 --> 15:07.042
Up here, my furry friend.
Very good, very good.

15:07.044 --> 15:09.808
- Now, your name is?
- Paddington Brown.

15:09.810 --> 15:12.908
Oh, well, of course it is.
You are my new neighbor.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.475
You live with

15:14.477 --> 15:17.675
Henry and Mary
and the great Mrs...

15:19.445 --> 15:21.510
Now then, I suppose you know
who I am?

15:21.512 --> 15:23.775
Oh, yes,
you're a very famous actor.

15:23.777 --> 15:26.975
- Oh, pooh.
- Or used to be.

15:26.977 --> 15:29.343
Now you do
dog food commercials.

15:30.545 --> 15:33.441
- Well, a man has to eat.
- What, dog food?

15:38.943 --> 15:40.342
Very, very funny.

15:40.344 --> 15:43.641
Anyway, they do say that
at Madame Kozlova's,

15:43.643 --> 15:45.543
all your dreams come true.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.175
So, if you had one wish
tonight, what would it be?

15:48.177 --> 15:49.641
Oh, that's easy.

15:49.643 --> 15:51.774
I'd like to get my Aunt Lucy
a birthday present.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.243
- Aww.
- Aww. Darling.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.808
I've got my eye on
an old pop-up book of London.

15:55.810 --> 15:58.410
Made by Madame Kozlova,
as it happens.

15:58.412 --> 16:00.543
The only problem is
it's rather expensive.

16:00.545 --> 16:03.209
So I need to get my paws on
an awful lot of money.

16:03.211 --> 16:05.740
Well, I'm not sure that
we can offer you that.

16:05.742 --> 16:08.008
But we can of course
offer you

16:08.010 --> 16:09.342
oodles of fun.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.708
So, if you would like to
lend me a paw,

16:11.710 --> 16:15.408
we now declare
Kozlova's Steam Fair

16:15.410 --> 16:17.574
open!

16:17.576 --> 16:20.475
Thank you,
thank you very much.

16:20.477 --> 16:22.777
Wonderful, thank you.

16:25.278 --> 16:27.574
- Mrs. Brown?
- Just one moment.

16:27.576 --> 16:29.476
- A word in your ear.
- Hmm?

16:29.478 --> 16:31.775
This, er, this pop-up book.

16:31.777 --> 16:33.707
- Do you know it?
- I know of it.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.675
But I was led to believe
it was lost.

16:35.677 --> 16:37.442
Where on earth
did you find it?

16:37.444 --> 16:39.342
Oh, at Mr. Gruber's
Antique Shop.

16:39.344 --> 16:41.309
He's keeping it to one side
for me,

16:41.311 --> 16:42.976
but I really need a job.

16:42.978 --> 16:46.409
I don't suppose you have
any advice, do you?

16:46.411 --> 16:48.442
No. No. No.

16:48.444 --> 16:49.841
I imagine you just have to

16:49.843 --> 16:51.609
start at the bottom
of the ladder

16:51.611 --> 16:53.441
and work your way up.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.208
Do you know what,
Mr. Buchanan?

16:55.210 --> 16:56.475
Hmm?

16:56.477 --> 16:58.874
You've just given me
the most brilliant idea.

16:58.876 --> 16:59.808
Have I?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.010
I'm going to be
a window cleaner.

17:22.877 --> 17:24.045
Hmm...

17:25.109 --> 17:26.411
Ah.

17:45.877 --> 17:46.911
Ah.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.077
Hmm?

18:00.110 --> 18:01.444
Oh... Oh, dear.

18:03.743 --> 18:04.810
Um...

18:14.278 --> 18:15.477
Hmm...

18:16.411 --> 18:18.042
Ow.

18:22.110 --> 18:24.311
Hello? Anyone?

18:46.677 --> 18:47.678
Hmm?

18:55.743 --> 18:58.676
- Hello? Window cleaner.
- No, thank you.

18:58.678 --> 19:01.309
Sure, Colonel?
They're awfully dirty.

19:01.311 --> 19:04.276
I don't care
and I'm not paying.

19:04.278 --> 19:06.507
Perhaps I'll do them anyway.

19:53.310 --> 19:54.675
Good afternoon, Colonel.

19:54.677 --> 19:57.375
Are you aware
there's a bear on your roof?

19:57.377 --> 19:59.841
Yes, he seems to be
cleaning my windows.

19:59.843 --> 20:02.241
Shall I do your gutters
while I'm up here?

20:02.243 --> 20:05.141
Um, yes. Thank you.

20:05.143 --> 20:07.908
Well, of course it's not
for me to say, Colonel,

20:07.910 --> 20:10.308
but I wouldn't care to have
an undesirable

20:10.310 --> 20:12.075
crawling all over my premises.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.574
And as Commander of your
Community Defense Force...

20:14.576 --> 20:16.876
Is that an official position,
Mr. Curry?

20:16.878 --> 20:19.743
Or have you just bought
yourself a yellow coat?

20:21.911 --> 20:23.710
Got my eye on you, bear.

20:24.744 --> 20:27.143
Oh. Sorry.

20:27.145 --> 20:29.574
<i>♪ Here's a little song</i>

20:29.576 --> 20:31.911

21:28.977 --> 21:31.208
One more day, Aunt Lucy.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.444
Hmm?

21:38.943 --> 21:40.077
Mr. Gruber?

21:40.677 --> 21:41.573
Eh?

21:41.575 --> 21:42.908
You're not Mr. Gruber!

21:42.910 --> 21:45.677
- Clear off!
- Oh, no, you don't.

21:57.911 --> 21:59.909
Stop! Thief!

22:01.977 --> 22:04.208
Come back with that book!

22:05.577 --> 22:07.641
Robbery in progress
at Gruber's Antiques.

22:07.643 --> 22:09.675
Suspect is
a small bear wearing

22:09.677 --> 22:11.778
a red hat
and blue duffle coat.

22:13.843 --> 22:14.843
Stop!

22:16.010 --> 22:17.510
Come back!

22:22.076 --> 22:23.343
No!

22:31.944 --> 22:33.678
Come on, Wolfie.

22:40.677 --> 22:42.575
Oi!

22:42.577 --> 22:45.008
- Oi! Get off it!
- Give that back!

22:46.643 --> 22:48.109
No!

22:48.111 --> 22:50.844
- Nice try, bear.
- Whoa, Wolfie.

22:53.743 --> 22:55.241
Toodle-oo.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.141
Oh. Um...

23:00.276 --> 23:01.743
Giddy-up!

23:03.276 --> 23:04.477
Ow.

23:05.477 --> 23:07.011
Come on, boy.

23:14.043 --> 23:17.543
Excuse me. Coming through.
Who are you?

23:19.744 --> 23:21.308
Oh, dear.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.443
Strike a light! Oh!

23:25.678 --> 23:29.009
That book is reserved
for Aunt Lucy!

23:30.143 --> 23:32.141
Hello there.

23:32.143 --> 23:33.941
Oh! Ow. Not the snout!

23:33.943 --> 23:35.441
Wolfie!

23:39.543 --> 23:42.778
Thank you, Wolfie.
Come on. Attaboy.

23:46.943 --> 23:50.474
All right, all right.
You got me.

23:50.476 --> 23:51.909
Hand over that book.

23:51.911 --> 23:54.511
'Fraid I can't do that.
Cheerio.

23:56.744 --> 23:58.744
But

23:59.944 --> 24:01.674
where did he go?

24:01.676 --> 24:03.507
Hold it right there.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.542
Oh, thank goodness
you're here, Officer.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.675
Put your... paws in the air.

24:07.677 --> 24:09.942
But I'm not the thief.

24:09.944 --> 24:13.408
I was chasing the thief.
And then he... He...

24:13.410 --> 24:15.507
Disappeared in
a puff of smoke?

24:15.509 --> 24:18.311
Well, yes.

24:35.811 --> 24:37.274
- Paddington!
- Oh, no!

24:37.276 --> 24:38.875
- What's going on?
- Hold it there.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.508
Hang on. Hang on. We're
taking him into custody.

24:40.510 --> 24:42.508
- There must be some mistake.
- No mistake, sir.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.742
What's happened?

24:43.744 --> 24:45.441
- Caught red-handed.
- What?

24:45.443 --> 24:47.009
Robbing Gruber's Antiques.

24:47.011 --> 24:51.408
Well, well, well.
The truth is out.

24:51.410 --> 24:54.174
We opened our hearts
to that bear,

24:54.176 --> 24:55.875
we opened our doors.

24:55.877 --> 24:58.540
Well, you did.
I kept mine triple locked

24:58.542 --> 25:00.542
in accordance
with the guidelines.

25:00.544 --> 25:05.009
And all along,
he was robbing you blind.

25:06.143 --> 25:07.411
Paddington!

25:08.443 --> 25:10.776
- Oh, no!
- Paddington!

25:10.778 --> 25:12.443
Oh, dear!

25:16.676 --> 25:19.807
A nice little haul,
and no mistake.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.007
Turned out to be quite
a stroke of luck,

25:22.009 --> 25:24.575
that bear turning up
when he did.

25:24.577 --> 25:27.911
Coppers think he done it.
We're in the clear.

25:31.075 --> 25:33.474
Indeed, Magwitch.

25:33.476 --> 25:36.508
And we gave quite
a performance, you and I.

25:36.510 --> 25:39.443
Just like the old days.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.675
Why the lemon face, Hamlet?

25:42.677 --> 25:44.341
If you have something to say,

25:44.343 --> 25:46.407
I beg you,
share it with us all.

25:46.409 --> 25:48.941
It is not,
nor it cannot come to good.

25:48.943 --> 25:51.774
Oh, really. You and your
dreary conscience.

25:51.776 --> 25:53.707
Tell me this.
Which would you rather?

25:53.709 --> 25:56.040
That you stand here,
gathering dust

25:56.042 --> 25:57.842
while I humiliate myself

25:57.844 --> 26:00.475
in a spaniel's costume
on television

26:00.477 --> 26:03.108
or that we all return in glory

26:03.110 --> 26:04.808
in the greatest one-man show

26:04.810 --> 26:07.307
the West End has ever seen?

26:08.809 --> 26:12.741
Oh, thank you, my darlings.
Thank you. Thank you.

26:12.743 --> 26:17.642
Blessings upon you all.
Deepest of bows. Thank you.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.274
I know what you're thinking,
Scrooge.

26:19.276 --> 26:20.440
It will cost a fortune,

26:20.442 --> 26:21.841
but if I'm right,

26:21.843 --> 26:25.407
that is exactly
what this book will provide.

26:25.409 --> 26:28.341
This is no dusty antique.

26:28.343 --> 26:30.274
Hidden on every page,

26:30.276 --> 26:33.008
a little lady
pointing to a clue.

26:33.010 --> 26:38.342
Find all the clues,
we're rich again,

26:38.344 --> 26:41.644
and our dog food days
are done.

26:42.943 --> 26:45.141
<i>Dinner is served, Master.</i>

26:45.143 --> 26:46.609
<i>Thank you, Simkins.</i>

26:46.611 --> 26:50.808
<i>If, like me, your doggie likes
to maintain standards,</i>

26:50.810 --> 26:53.842
<i>can I recommend
Harley's Gourmet Dindins.</i>

26:53.844 --> 26:57.440
<i>More taste,
more goodness, more,</i>

26:57.442 --> 27:00.175
<i>dare one say, class.</i>

27:00.177 --> 27:01.474
<i>Mmm.</i>

27:01.476 --> 27:03.307
<i>Harley's Gourmet Dog Food.</i>

27:03.309 --> 27:05.510
- <i>Woof.</i>
- <i>Not to be consumed by humans.</i>

27:07.043 --> 27:09.074
Court will rise.

27:09.076 --> 27:12.173
Deep breath, Paddington.
Remember what Mr. Brown said.

27:12.175 --> 27:15.842
"You're young. You've done
nothing wrong. You'll be fine.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.507
"So long as you get
a fair-minded judge."

27:18.509 --> 27:20.976
Order! O... Order.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.274
Oh, dear.

27:26.276 --> 27:29.909
You'll now hear the case of
the Crown versus Paddington

27:30.377 --> 27:31.841
Brown.

27:33.376 --> 27:35.307
Oh, yes, he loved the book.

27:35.309 --> 27:37.475
His heart was set
on top of it.

27:37.477 --> 27:40.674
So you discussed
how expensive it was?

27:40.676 --> 27:43.775
Yes, but he was earning
the money.

27:43.777 --> 27:46.742
I refuse to believe that
young Mr. Brown

27:46.744 --> 27:48.841
would ever burglarize my shop.

27:48.843 --> 27:50.741
Exactly.

27:50.743 --> 27:52.141
Paw prints were found

27:52.143 --> 27:55.708
here, here, and here.

27:55.710 --> 27:58.677
And a substance, later
identified as marmalade,

27:59.376 --> 28:01.241
was found here.

28:01.243 --> 28:04.376
And is this
the same marmalade?

28:10.476 --> 28:11.808
Yes, it is.

28:13.210 --> 28:15.007
Phoenix Buchanan, do you
swear to tell the truth,

28:15.009 --> 28:17.241
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

28:17.243 --> 28:19.674
May my entrails
be plucked forth

28:19.676 --> 28:23.475
and wound about my neck
should I deceive.

28:23.477 --> 28:26.907
I do.
Prison is no laughing matter.

28:26.909 --> 28:30.841
And I should know, I spent
three years in <i>Les Misérables.</i>

28:32.477 --> 28:35.207
Mr. Buchanan,
you live on the same street

28:35.209 --> 28:36.774
- as the defendant?
- I do.

28:36.776 --> 28:40.408
And you were an eye witness
to the events that night?

28:40.410 --> 28:42.173
Indeed I was.

28:42.175 --> 28:45.440
I was up late, when I became
aware of a hullabaloo

28:45.442 --> 28:46.840
in the street below.

28:46.842 --> 28:50.642
I went to my awards room,
which is a large room

28:50.644 --> 28:52.541
overlooking
the newspaper kiosk,

28:52.543 --> 28:54.742
and I saw young Paddington

28:54.744 --> 28:58.173
riding a rather
disreputable-looking hound.

28:58.175 --> 29:00.208
Mary Brown drew this

29:00.210 --> 29:01.776
based on
the bear's description

29:01.778 --> 29:04.442
of the man he claims
he was chasing.

29:04.444 --> 29:07.775
Did you see him on the street
that night?

29:07.777 --> 29:10.441
Oh, a handsome devil,
isn't he? Hmm?

29:10.443 --> 29:13.874
- Dazzling eyes.
- Yes, but did you see him?

29:13.876 --> 29:18.040
Your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty.

29:18.042 --> 29:19.644
Did you see this man?

29:20.344 --> 29:21.744
Alas,

29:22.842 --> 29:23.941
I did not.

29:25.109 --> 29:27.074
But perhaps
he'd already vanished.

29:27.076 --> 29:31.311
I beg you, have mercy on him.
He is but a cub.

29:33.142 --> 29:35.442
Paddington Brown.

29:35.444 --> 29:38.908
Ten years for grand theft...

29:38.910 --> 29:40.240
Oh, but, I...

29:40.242 --> 29:44.009
...and grievous barberly harm.

29:46.277 --> 29:48.678
Follow me.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.841
Oh, um...

30:15.843 --> 30:18.208
Mrs. Brown usually reads me
a story before bed.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.541
I don't suppose...

30:19.543 --> 30:22.741
Sorry, son.
No bedtime stories in here.

30:22.743 --> 30:23.810
Oh.

30:42.243 --> 30:44.275
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy.</i>

30:44.277 --> 30:47.707
<i>A great deal has happened
since I last wrote.</i>

30:47.709 --> 30:50.874
<i>There's been a bit of a mix-up
with your present,</i>

30:50.876 --> 30:52.773
<i>and the upshot is
I've had to leave</i>

30:52.775 --> 30:55.408
<i>Windsor Gardens and move</i>

30:55.410 --> 30:57.806
<i>somewhere else.</i>

30:57.808 --> 31:01.008
<i>It isn't quite as charming
as the Browns' house,</i>

31:01.010 --> 31:02.607
<i>but it's not all bad.</i>

31:02.609 --> 31:04.774
<i>It's a period property.</i>

31:04.776 --> 31:06.774
<i>In fact, it's one of
the most substantial</i>

31:06.776 --> 31:09.140
<i>Victorian buildings
in London,</i>

31:09.142 --> 31:11.007
<i>and the security arrangements</i>

31:11.009 --> 31:12.906
<i>are second to none.</i>

31:12.908 --> 31:15.842
<i>I'm only allowed to see
the Browns once a month.</i>

31:16.776 --> 31:19.343
<i>I wonder
what they're doing now.</i>

31:44.443 --> 31:46.910
<i>I do hope
they don't forget me.</i>

31:48.509 --> 31:49.973
Of course they won't,
Paddington.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.474
This is the Browns
you're talking about.

31:52.476 --> 31:54.041
<i>They'll sort everything out,</i>

31:54.043 --> 31:56.907
<i>and I'll be able to go home
and get your present,</i>

31:56.909 --> 31:59.776
<i>and everything will be
right as rain.</i>

32:00.876 --> 32:03.610
I just need to hold on
till then.

32:43.676 --> 32:44.677
D.

32:50.277 --> 32:52.076
The hunt begins.

32:57.276 --> 33:02.573
325, 326, 327...

33:02.575 --> 33:05.207
Here goes, Paddington.
Manners.

33:05.209 --> 33:06.542
Fall in.

33:07.243 --> 33:08.673
Good morning.

33:08.675 --> 33:10.207
How would you like to start
a gardening club?

33:10.209 --> 33:14.407
How would you like to be
buried in a very deep hole?

33:14.409 --> 33:15.674
After you.

33:15.676 --> 33:17.876
Spooner, R. Workshop.

33:19.376 --> 33:22.841
Brown, P. Laundry duty.

33:22.843 --> 33:24.907
Right, laundry.

33:24.909 --> 33:26.442
Laundry, laundry?

33:26.444 --> 33:27.977
Ah! Laundry!

33:45.842 --> 33:47.043
Ugh!

33:52.342 --> 33:53.610
Oh!

34:16.610 --> 34:18.706
Oh, it's only one red sock.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.076
What's the worst
that can happen?

34:24.409 --> 34:26.340
Afternoon, chaps.

34:27.943 --> 34:31.308
If you ask me, the pink really
brightens the place up a bit.

34:31.310 --> 34:35.607
If you ask me, you should pipe
down and enjoy your dinner,

34:35.609 --> 34:37.842
because it might be
your last.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.473
Okay.

34:56.275 --> 34:57.908
Ugh.

34:57.910 --> 35:00.673
Don't worry. I used to be
a restaurant critic.

35:00.675 --> 35:02.809
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Oh.

35:04.475 --> 35:06.275
It's worse.

35:06.277 --> 35:08.240
What is this?

35:08.242 --> 35:09.573
Nobody knows.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.975
But we've been eating it
three times a day

35:11.977 --> 35:13.640
for the past ten years.

35:13.642 --> 35:14.907
Why doesn't someone have

35:14.909 --> 35:17.340
a word with the chef?

35:17.342 --> 35:20.208
With Knuckles?

35:20.210 --> 35:23.140
Two things to remember if you
want to survive in here.

35:23.142 --> 35:27.007
Keep your head down
and never talk to Knuckles.

35:27.009 --> 35:27.974
Thank you.

35:27.976 --> 35:30.140
Well I think
it's a great idea.

35:30.142 --> 35:31.441
Tell you what, son,

35:31.443 --> 35:33.573
you get Knuckles to change
the menu and

35:33.575 --> 35:35.574
we might forget about you
making us

35:35.576 --> 35:38.107
look like
a bunch of pink flamingos.

35:38.109 --> 35:41.073
- All right then, I will.
- You don't wanna

35:41.075 --> 35:42.707
- do that.
- Aunt Lucy said,

35:42.709 --> 35:45.439
"If you look for the good
in people, you'll find it."

35:45.441 --> 35:47.876
She obviously
never met Knuckles.

35:54.109 --> 35:55.810
Um, excuse me.

35:56.809 --> 35:58.475
Mr. Knuckles?

35:59.042 --> 36:00.275
Yes?

36:00.277 --> 36:01.708
I just wondered
if I could have

36:01.710 --> 36:03.508
a quick word about the food?

36:03.510 --> 36:06.041
Send a medic to the canteen.

36:06.043 --> 36:07.843
You want to

36:08.877 --> 36:10.341
complain?

36:10.343 --> 36:12.308
Oh, no,
I wouldn't say complain.

36:12.310 --> 36:13.707
Oh, that's a shame.

36:13.709 --> 36:17.643
Because I just love it
when people complain.

36:18.408 --> 36:20.475
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

36:20.943 --> 36:22.041
Oh.

36:22.043 --> 36:24.708
Well, in that case,
it's very gritty.

36:24.710 --> 36:26.440
- Oh.
- And lumpy.

36:26.442 --> 36:27.908
And as for the bread...

36:29.210 --> 36:30.673
Need I say more?

36:30.675 --> 36:33.440
I think we need to completely
overhaul the menu.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.041
Now I know we're working to
a tight budget,

36:35.043 --> 36:37.108
but we could at least
add some sauce.

36:38.341 --> 36:41.407
Oh. Sorry about that.
I'll just...

36:41.409 --> 36:44.240
Hmm. No,
that's just rubbing it in.

36:45.742 --> 36:48.442
Don't worry. I know
what gets ketchup stains out.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.076
Hang on, was it mustard?

36:53.875 --> 36:55.340
No.

36:55.342 --> 36:57.373
That's just made it worse!

36:57.375 --> 36:59.876
Does anyone know
what works on ketchup?

37:00.375 --> 37:01.576
Chaps?

37:05.709 --> 37:07.975
Forget the medic.
Better send a priest.

37:07.977 --> 37:09.906
You listen to me,
you little maggot.

37:09.908 --> 37:11.074
Listening.

37:11.076 --> 37:13.574
Nobody criticizes my food!

37:13.576 --> 37:14.907
- Right.
- Nobody

37:14.909 --> 37:17.740
squirts condiments
on my apron.

37:17.742 --> 37:19.441
- Got it.
- And nobody

37:19.443 --> 37:22.341
bonks me on the head
with a baguette.

37:22.343 --> 37:23.573
No bonking.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.706
I'll overhaul
the menu all right.

37:24.708 --> 37:26.373
- Really?
- Dish of the day.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.075
- Yes?
- Bear pie.

37:28.077 --> 37:29.843
I don't like it.

37:46.409 --> 37:48.207
What is this?

37:48.209 --> 37:50.642
It's a marmalade sandwich.

37:51.375 --> 37:52.774
Marmalade?

37:52.776 --> 37:55.474
My Aunt Lucy taught me
to make them.

37:55.476 --> 37:57.608
You mean, you can make this?

37:57.610 --> 38:01.541
- Well, yes.
- Stand aside.

38:01.543 --> 38:06.207
Get up off the floor,
you bunch of yellow-bellies!

38:06.209 --> 38:07.875
Listen to me.

38:07.877 --> 38:09.306
This bear is now

38:09.308 --> 38:11.207
- under my protection.
- Oh.

38:11.209 --> 38:14.240
Anyone who touches a hair
on his back

38:14.242 --> 38:17.606
will answer
to Knuckles McGinty.

38:17.608 --> 38:20.676
That's Knuckles with
a capital 'N.'

38:22.710 --> 38:25.941
- Thank you, Mr. McGinty.
- Don't thank me yet.

38:25.943 --> 38:29.475
I don't do nothin'
for no one for nothin'.

38:30.009 --> 38:31.973
Beg your pardon?

38:31.975 --> 38:33.875
You get my protection

38:33.877 --> 38:37.443
so long as you make
that marmalade. Deal?

38:40.075 --> 38:41.943
Deal.

38:48.176 --> 38:51.340
Somebody's got to recognize
him sooner or later.

38:53.175 --> 38:54.941
You all right, Mr. Gruber?

38:54.943 --> 38:56.940
There's something about
this whole business

38:56.942 --> 38:58.841
that has been tickling
my brainbox.

38:58.843 --> 39:00.175
What is it?

39:00.177 --> 39:01.975
On the night of the robbery,

39:01.977 --> 39:03.874
when young Mr. Brown
called out,

39:03.876 --> 39:06.974
<i>the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs.</i>

39:06.976 --> 39:08.774
<i>Came straight through
the shop</i>

39:08.776 --> 39:11.641
<i>and out the front door,
setting off the alarm.</i>

39:11.643 --> 39:14.640
Ah. But that's the thing.
He didn't go straight through

39:14.642 --> 39:16.008
- the shop.
- No?

39:16.010 --> 39:17.506
<i>He came all the way
over here</i>

39:17.508 --> 39:18.906
<i>to get the popping book.</i>

39:18.908 --> 39:21.874
<i>Why not some jewelry
or a vase?</i>

39:21.876 --> 39:24.606
They're much closer.
Far more valuable.

39:24.608 --> 39:26.640
He can't know much
about antiques.

39:26.642 --> 39:27.743
No.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.074
Unless

39:30.076 --> 39:33.742
he knows something about
that book that we don't.

39:35.543 --> 39:38.407
You may find this hard
to believe, Madame Kozlova,

39:38.409 --> 39:39.874
but Paddington is innocent.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.674
And we think that
the real thief

39:41.676 --> 39:43.106
may have broken
into Mr Gruber's

39:43.108 --> 39:45.808
just to steal your
great-grandmother's pop-up book.

39:45.810 --> 39:49.273
- The pop-up book?
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

39:49.275 --> 39:51.474
But is there anything you could
tell us about that book?

39:51.476 --> 39:53.543
Anything at all
could be helpful.

39:54.709 --> 39:57.910
- That's quite a story.
- Oh, really?

39:59.242 --> 40:00.875
Come with me.

40:00.877 --> 40:03.839
I'll show you
where it all happened.

40:03.841 --> 40:08.007
You see, my great-grandmother,
who started this fair,

40:08.009 --> 40:11.340
<i>was the finest show woman
of her generation.</i>

40:11.342 --> 40:15.506
<i>She could tame lions,
breathe fire, swallow swords,</i>

40:15.508 --> 40:20.641
<i>but she was most famous
for the trapeze.</i>

40:20.643 --> 40:23.873
<i>They called her
the "Flying Swan."</i>

40:23.875 --> 40:27.340
<i>Wherever she went,
she was showered with gifts,</i>

40:27.342 --> 40:28.975
<i>and made a fortune.</i>

40:28.977 --> 40:34.406
<i>But where there is a fortune,
there is also jealousy.</i>

40:34.408 --> 40:38.206
<i>The magician
wanted it for himself.</i>

40:38.208 --> 40:39.943
<i>And the "Flying Swan"...</i>

40:42.543 --> 40:46.573
<i>...became the "Dying Swan."</i>

40:46.575 --> 40:50.410
<i>He went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox.</i>

40:51.543 --> 40:53.673
<i>But instead of her treasure,</i>

40:53.675 --> 40:57.807
<i>all he found was
one of her pop-up books:</i>

40:57.809 --> 41:01.007
<i>Twelve Landmarks of London.</i>

41:01.009 --> 41:04.542
<i>They had him cornered,
but he vanished.</i>

41:05.676 --> 41:08.540
<i>And neither he,
nor the treasure,</i>

41:08.542 --> 41:10.843
<i>were ever heard of again.</i>

41:11.976 --> 41:13.506
I knew
there was something special

41:13.508 --> 41:15.106
- about that pop-up book.
- Hmm?

41:15.108 --> 41:17.841
Well, why else would she have
kept it in her strongbox?

41:17.843 --> 41:20.074
You're not telling me you
believed all that guff, are you?

41:20.076 --> 41:23.406
Madame Kozlova drew 12 London
landmarks in that book.

41:23.408 --> 41:24.640
Yes?

41:24.642 --> 41:26.007
Well, what if they're not
just landmarks.

41:26.009 --> 41:28.676
What if they're...
I don't know...

41:30.010 --> 41:31.407
- ...clues!
- Clues?

41:31.409 --> 41:34.306
- To where she hid her fortune.
- You mean a treasure map?

41:34.308 --> 41:35.740
Exactly!

41:35.742 --> 41:38.139
And that's why the thief
took it from Mr Gruber's.

41:38.141 --> 41:41.140
First thing tomorrow we need to go
to every landmark in that book,

41:41.142 --> 41:44.007
see if we can sniff out
anything suspicious.

41:44.009 --> 41:46.007
Too many adventure stories,
Mary.

41:46.009 --> 41:47.106
What?

41:47.108 --> 41:48.406
She's a fortune-teller.

41:48.408 --> 41:50.806
She spun you a yarn.
It's what they do.

41:50.808 --> 41:53.073
Honestly, Henry, you're
so close-minded these days.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.340
What's that supposed to mean?

41:54.342 --> 41:56.507
What happened to the man
I married?

41:56.509 --> 41:57.640
He'd have believed me.

41:57.642 --> 42:00.673
- Oh, him. He's gone.
- What?

42:00.675 --> 42:02.975
I'm afraid your husband's
just a creaky old man,

42:02.977 --> 42:05.741
he's not Bullseye Brown.

42:05.743 --> 42:08.609
<i>♪ I'm crazy like a fool</i>

42:09.643 --> 42:12.375
<i>♪ What about Daddy Cool?</i>

42:13.309 --> 42:15.977
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

42:17.274 --> 42:19.741
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

42:19.743 --> 42:20.974
Bullseye.

42:20.976 --> 42:22.441
Oh, Henry.

42:22.443 --> 42:24.473
<i>She's crazy about her daddy</i>

42:24.475 --> 42:26.607
Henry? Henry!

42:26.609 --> 42:27.874
Anyway, the point is,

42:27.876 --> 42:29.307
we're not going to
help Paddington

42:29.309 --> 42:30.741
by going on
a wild goose chase.

42:30.743 --> 42:32.474
We're looking for this
scruffy chancer,

42:32.476 --> 42:34.273
not some
swashbuckling pirate

42:34.275 --> 42:36.641
hunting for buried treasure.

42:36.643 --> 42:39.940
I think there's more to him
than meets the eye.

42:39.942 --> 42:41.706
I think he somehow knew
the story

42:41.708 --> 42:43.641
of the Kozlova fortune

42:43.643 --> 42:46.576
<i>and is out there right now
trying to find it.</i>

42:47.443 --> 42:49.606
Well, Grandfather,

42:49.608 --> 42:54.539
tonight we go in search
of clue number two.

42:54.541 --> 42:58.441
The setting,
St. Paul's Cathedral.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.910
<i>But how to slip in unobserved?</i>

43:01.609 --> 43:04.709
<i>Enter Sister Isabella.</i>

43:14.742 --> 43:17.873
Wakey-wakey.

43:17.875 --> 43:19.676
Marmalade time.

43:21.576 --> 43:24.774
There you go, lads.
Good luck.

43:24.776 --> 43:27.807
- Um, Mr. McGinty...
- What do you want?

43:27.809 --> 43:30.775
Well, the thing is,
I'm actually innocent.

43:30.777 --> 43:32.574
And I wondered
if you had any advice

43:32.576 --> 43:34.807
on how to clear my name?
Now that we're friends.

43:34.809 --> 43:38.307
Friends? I'm
your boss, not your buddy.

43:38.309 --> 43:40.841
Oh. Well, after you.

43:40.843 --> 43:43.973
Why? So you can stab me
in the back?

43:43.975 --> 43:46.473
No. Because it's polite.

43:46.475 --> 43:48.540
Aunt Lucy said,
"If we're kind and polite,

43:48.542 --> 43:50.072
"the world will be right."

43:50.074 --> 43:52.306
You were ahead of me
and now you're behind.

43:52.308 --> 43:53.609
That makes you a sap.

43:54.742 --> 43:57.739
- Ingredients are over there.
- Um...

43:57.741 --> 44:01.106
- Aren't you going to help?
- Nope. Now get on with it.

44:01.108 --> 44:03.973
But there's 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast,

44:03.975 --> 44:06.373
so we'll need
1,000 juicy oranges and...

44:06.375 --> 44:09.707
Oh, and rule number one:
no talking.

44:15.909 --> 44:18.606
Rule number two:

44:18.608 --> 44:20.972
- no humming or singing...
- But... I...

44:20.974 --> 44:24.941
...or any other expression
of bonhomie.

44:44.209 --> 44:46.773
Ooh, that's heavy.

44:46.775 --> 44:48.876
Come on,
put your back into it.

44:51.876 --> 44:52.909
Help.

44:55.643 --> 44:57.340
These sacks are awfully heavy.

44:57.342 --> 44:59.273
Well, take them
one at a time, then.

44:59.275 --> 45:01.941
Right. One at a... time.

45:09.209 --> 45:11.076
One juicy orange.

45:15.643 --> 45:17.643
Two juicy oranges.

45:21.074 --> 45:22.941
Three juicy oranges.

45:24.576 --> 45:28.039
- Now what are you doing?
- Taking them one at a time.

45:28.041 --> 45:29.940
One sack at a time!

45:29.942 --> 45:33.473
I'm sorry, I'm finding this a very
stressful working environment.

45:33.475 --> 45:34.940
Aunt Lucy said...

45:34.942 --> 45:37.239
Aunt Lucy! I've had it up to
here with Aunt Lucy!

45:37.241 --> 45:38.640
She sounds like

45:38.642 --> 45:40.743
a proper old bag to me.

45:42.408 --> 45:44.709
I beg your pardon?

45:45.309 --> 45:47.073
I said,

45:47.075 --> 45:51.773
your Aunt Lucy sounds like
one of the most naive,

45:51.775 --> 45:54.642
gullible, mushy-brained...

45:55.841 --> 45:57.409
What's going on?

45:59.441 --> 46:01.409
Why are you looking at me
like that?

46:02.807 --> 46:06.474
It's awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I'm hot.

46:06.476 --> 46:08.572
Did I leave the oven on?

46:08.574 --> 46:11.507
It's called a hard stare.

46:11.509 --> 46:13.306
Aunt Lucy taught me to do them

46:13.308 --> 46:15.308
when people had forgotten
their manners.

46:15.310 --> 46:17.074
You don't have to tell me
about hard stares,

46:17.076 --> 46:19.839
I practically invented them.

46:19.841 --> 46:22.174
Pretty good for a bear though,
I'll give you that.

46:22.176 --> 46:23.573
Now, Mr. McGinty,

46:23.575 --> 46:25.940
I may look like
a hardened criminal to you,

46:25.942 --> 46:27.207
but I really am innocent.

46:27.209 --> 46:29.473
And if you're not going to
help me clear my name,

46:29.475 --> 46:32.272
you could at least help me
make this marmalade.

46:32.274 --> 46:34.307
All right, I'll help.

46:34.309 --> 46:35.574
Thank you.

46:35.576 --> 46:37.541
Not gonna be much use
to you though.

46:37.543 --> 46:39.873
These weren't exactly made
for cooking.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.073
Oh, I don't know.

46:41.075 --> 46:42.641
Looks to me like
you've got yourself

46:42.643 --> 46:44.939
a fine pair
of orange squeezers.

46:44.941 --> 46:46.808
Orange squeezers?

46:50.175 --> 46:52.073
Good.

46:52.075 --> 46:53.174
No.

46:53.176 --> 46:54.307
Better.

46:54.309 --> 46:55.440
Tomato.

46:55.442 --> 46:56.840
Lovely.

46:56.842 --> 46:59.441
Yes. Spot on.

46:59.443 --> 47:01.640
Now, we have to be
very careful with knives.

47:01.642 --> 47:04.306
Aunt Lucy said that
sensible bears...

47:05.874 --> 47:07.640
Where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that?

47:07.642 --> 47:09.609
You don't wanna know.

47:10.474 --> 47:12.542
Well, it's jolly good.

47:14.376 --> 47:15.806
Now?

47:15.808 --> 47:16.809
Now.

47:18.643 --> 47:21.039
- Right, it's time for the sugar.
- Okay.

47:21.041 --> 47:23.441
That's what turns the juice
into marmalade.

47:23.443 --> 47:26.139
- How much?
- Ooh, a lot.

47:28.142 --> 47:30.140
Same again.

47:30.142 --> 47:31.673
Ah.

47:31.675 --> 47:33.973
A squeeze of lemon.

47:33.975 --> 47:36.172
A pinch of cinnamon.

47:36.174 --> 47:38.907
And just a bit more sugar.

47:38.909 --> 47:41.439
Well, is it good?

47:41.441 --> 47:43.374
Oh, it's too soon to tell.

47:43.376 --> 47:45.842
We'll only really know
once it's set.

47:47.576 --> 47:49.340
Designed
by Sir Christopher Wren,

47:49.342 --> 47:50.640
St. Paul's Cathedral is

47:50.642 --> 47:52.873
one of London's
most famous landmarks.

47:52.875 --> 47:55.705
Sadly the Great Dome is
closed to visitors today

47:55.707 --> 47:57.274
as one of its statues

47:57.276 --> 48:00.174
was destroyed in a bizarre
accident last night.

48:00.176 --> 48:01.339
But if you follow me...

48:01.341 --> 48:03.373
Excuse me?
What happened here?

48:03.375 --> 48:06.073
- A nun went berserk.
- Really?

48:06.075 --> 48:07.607
It happens.

48:07.609 --> 48:10.672
The police have rounded them
all up for questioning.

48:10.674 --> 48:12.140
Hold it there, Sister!

48:12.142 --> 48:15.039
You're going nowhere till
the detective says so.

48:15.041 --> 48:16.675
Spin it around!

48:18.509 --> 48:21.272
Mind you, if you ask me,

48:21.274 --> 48:23.641
the real culprit
slipped the net.

48:24.409 --> 48:25.639
What makes you say that?

48:25.641 --> 48:28.606
Because I saw her,
that's what.

48:28.608 --> 48:30.740
<i>I was on patrol
in the Upper Dome,</i>

48:30.742 --> 48:33.307
<i>watching the nuns parade
far below,</i>

48:33.309 --> 48:35.873
<i>when something caught
my eye.</i>

48:35.875 --> 48:38.172
<i>One of them broke free
from the herd</i>

48:38.174 --> 48:40.908
<i>and made her way
to the Whispering Gallery.</i>

48:45.774 --> 48:48.873
<i>Only the good Lord knows
what she was doing up there.</i>

48:48.875 --> 48:50.873
"C."

48:50.875 --> 48:52.807
<i>But she was never gonna
get away with it.</i>

48:52.809 --> 48:55.873
<i>Not while I'm Vice Deputy
Head of Security.</i>

48:55.875 --> 48:56.908
Oi!

49:04.108 --> 49:06.773
Attention all units.
An unusually attractive nun

49:06.775 --> 49:08.840
is causing mayhem
in the cathedral dome.

49:08.842 --> 49:12.606
<i>Activate emergency protocol.
Stop that stunning Sister.</i>

49:12.608 --> 49:15.974
<i>I set off at lightning speed.</i>

49:15.976 --> 49:18.240
<i>But by the time
we'd locked the place down,</i>

49:18.242 --> 49:20.206
<i>she'd vanished into the night.</i>

49:20.208 --> 49:23.440
- Good evening, my son.
- Oh, good evening, Your Grace.

49:23.442 --> 49:25.407
Good evening.

49:26.842 --> 49:31.407
Most beautiful woman I've seen
in a long time.

49:31.409 --> 49:34.573
Do you think you might
be able to describe her?

49:34.575 --> 49:37.040
It would be my pleasure.

49:41.408 --> 49:43.939
Gentlemen.
For breakfast this morning,

49:43.941 --> 49:47.538
Chef McGinty would like to
propose an orange marmalade

49:47.540 --> 49:50.639
served on a bed of
warm crustless bread,

49:50.641 --> 49:55.409
topped with another piece
of warm crustless bread.

49:56.041 --> 49:57.574
Bon appetit.

49:59.675 --> 50:02.609
Two choices:
take it or leave it!

50:06.708 --> 50:08.272
Are you all right, Knuckles?

50:08.274 --> 50:09.573
Yes!

50:09.575 --> 50:11.407
Why don't you come
and join the others?

50:11.409 --> 50:12.809
Don't want to.

50:13.875 --> 50:15.307
Are you scared
what they might think?

50:15.309 --> 50:16.605
No!

50:16.607 --> 50:18.005
What do they think?
Did they like it?

50:18.007 --> 50:19.673
Did they say anything?
What did they say?

50:19.675 --> 50:22.474
- Well...
- They hated it! I knew it!

50:22.476 --> 50:24.473
My father always said
I'd amount to nothing,

50:24.475 --> 50:26.274
and he was right!

50:26.276 --> 50:28.207
Knuckles. Knuckles!

50:28.209 --> 50:29.307
What?

50:29.309 --> 50:30.842
Come and look.

50:33.276 --> 50:35.608
Mmm, mmm!

50:42.875 --> 50:43.942
Mmm.

50:45.941 --> 50:46.975
Mmm.

50:51.674 --> 50:53.075
Come on.

51:10.976 --> 51:12.407
Paddington.

51:12.409 --> 51:15.505
I've a strange, warm tingle
in my tum-tum.

51:15.507 --> 51:18.006
I think that's called pride,
Knuckles.

51:18.008 --> 51:19.709
Well, I don't like it.

51:23.041 --> 51:26.008
Um, have you got
anything else?

51:27.242 --> 51:28.439
What?

51:28.441 --> 51:30.273
You know, for, um, pudding?

51:30.275 --> 51:31.739
- No!
- Fair enough.

51:31.741 --> 51:34.139
I'm afraid we only know
how to make marmalade.

51:34.141 --> 51:36.240
But if you have any recipes...

51:36.242 --> 51:38.906
This lot? You're wasting
your time there, Paddington.

51:38.908 --> 51:43.141
They wouldn't know their
pectin from their paprika.

51:43.143 --> 51:47.473
Well, my grandmother used to
do a lovely chocolate roulade.

51:47.475 --> 51:49.207
I think
I can remember the recipe.

51:49.209 --> 51:50.573
Oh.

51:50.575 --> 51:53.040
Charley Rumble makes
a mean apple crumble.

51:55.974 --> 51:58.572
And I can make
a strawberry panna cotta

51:58.574 --> 52:01.172
with a pomegranate glaze.

52:01.174 --> 52:04.807
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Don't you, Knuckles?

52:04.809 --> 52:05.873
Yeah!

52:05.875 --> 52:08.872
Come on then,
let's get cooking.

52:08.874 --> 52:10.406
<i>♪ If this little proverb</i>

52:10.408 --> 52:11.873
<i>♪ You will understand</i>

52:11.875 --> 52:14.672
<i>♪ You will lend your brothers
a helping hand</i>

52:20.042 --> 52:21.509

52:23.175 --> 52:25.572
- There you go, Paddington.
- Ooh, Knuckles.

52:25.574 --> 52:28.141

- Well then.

I do hope you have good news.

53:51.174 --> 53:52.605
<i>In the past month,</i>

53:52.607 --> 53:55.573
these 3 shadowy individuals
have all been seen

53:55.575 --> 53:58.140
snooping round
3 London landmarks.

53:58.142 --> 53:59.440
We think
the thief you saw

53:59.442 --> 54:00.639
is part of a criminal gang.

54:00.641 --> 54:02.338
Using the pop-up book as
a treasure map.

54:02.340 --> 54:03.639
Well, it's a theory.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.073
Have you found out
who they are?

54:05.075 --> 54:06.374
Not yet, dearie.

54:07.209 --> 54:09.639
Maybe I should take a look.

54:09.641 --> 54:11.905
I'm sorry, this is
a private conversation.

54:11.907 --> 54:13.638
Oh, it's all right,
Mr. Brown,

54:13.640 --> 54:14.907
this is my friend, Knuckles.

54:14.909 --> 54:18.407
And this is Phibs. Spoon.
Jimmy the Snitch.

54:18.409 --> 54:21.406
T-Bone. The Professor.
Squeaky Pete.

54:21.408 --> 54:24.107
Double Bass Bob. Farmer Jack.
Mad Dog.

54:24.109 --> 54:26.538
Jonny Cashpoint.
Sir Geoffrey Wilcott.

54:26.540 --> 54:28.240
I hope I can rely
on your vote.

54:28.242 --> 54:30.906
And Charley Rumble.

54:30.908 --> 54:33.705
Oh, it's so wonderful
to meet you all.

54:33.707 --> 54:35.906
I must say, it's
a great relief to know that

54:35.908 --> 54:39.272
Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

54:39.274 --> 54:41.341
Would you excuse us a moment?

54:42.974 --> 54:45.940
- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men.

54:45.942 --> 54:49.539
"Nice men"? Mary,
we can't trust these people.

54:49.541 --> 54:51.107
I mean, look at them.

54:51.109 --> 54:54.006
Talk about a rogues' gallery.
Hideous.

54:54.008 --> 54:55.939
And as for that bearded baboon
in the middle,

54:55.941 --> 54:58.273
he's hardly got two brain
cells to rub together.

54:58.275 --> 55:01.306
We can still hear you,
Mr. Brown.

55:02.608 --> 55:04.439
That was the light
you turned off.

55:04.441 --> 55:06.674
The microphone is on
the other side.

55:06.676 --> 55:09.609
It's got "microphone"
written on it.

55:13.007 --> 55:16.340
Gentlemen, if I have
offended you in any way...

55:16.342 --> 55:17.473
Don't worry about it.

55:17.475 --> 55:18.907
We're fond of
the little fella.

55:18.909 --> 55:20.074
And let's face it,

55:20.076 --> 55:23.073
if anyone can recognize
a criminal gang, it's us.

55:24.175 --> 55:25.807
We'd be grateful for any help.

55:25.809 --> 55:27.140
Please.

55:27.142 --> 55:28.839
Well? Knuckles.

55:28.841 --> 55:32.006
I'm afraid I don't recognize
any of them. Lads?

55:32.008 --> 55:33.106
No.

55:33.108 --> 55:34.773
I'm afraid
I couldn't possibly comment.

55:34.775 --> 55:35.772
Oh.

55:35.774 --> 55:37.205
Sorry to say it, kid,

55:37.207 --> 55:39.073
but your friends are barking
up the wrong tree.

55:39.075 --> 55:42.106
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

55:42.108 --> 55:46.072
Sounds more like a fancy dress
party than a criminal gang.

55:46.074 --> 55:47.673
Then,

55:47.675 --> 55:49.809
what are we going to
do now?

55:58.474 --> 55:59.907
Oh!

55:59.909 --> 56:01.907
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

56:01.909 --> 56:04.709
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

56:07.441 --> 56:09.375
Keys. Keys. Keys!

56:10.808 --> 56:11.876
Bottoms!

56:13.941 --> 56:15.540
You can't park here!

56:15.542 --> 56:17.674
I'm not parked,
I'm doing the bins.

56:17.676 --> 56:20.272
You're not doing the bins,
sunshine,

56:20.274 --> 56:23.238
you're studying
on council time.

56:23.240 --> 56:25.073
I'm gonna report you.

56:25.075 --> 56:26.639
And your hat.

56:26.641 --> 56:29.406
- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown.

56:29.408 --> 56:31.138
Judy asked me
to drop these off to you.

56:31.140 --> 56:32.840
Propaganda!

56:32.842 --> 56:36.238
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

56:36.240 --> 56:39.373
Everyone round here knows
it was your bear that done it.

56:39.375 --> 56:43.073
And this street is a far,
far better place without him.

56:43.075 --> 56:44.538
What?

56:44.540 --> 56:46.674
Oh, it's that mangy dog!

56:46.676 --> 56:49.039
You are going to the pound,
my son.

56:49.041 --> 56:51.072
Barking without a license
in a built-up area.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.372
Give them here, Mary.

56:52.374 --> 56:53.839
I have to sell them
under the counter,

56:53.841 --> 56:56.238
for obvious reasons,
but people are buying them.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.338
Really?

56:57.340 --> 56:59.106
It's a bloomin' good read.

56:59.108 --> 57:00.406
Made a few people round here

57:00.408 --> 57:01.805
think twice
about your young bear.

57:01.807 --> 57:03.972
You just need to find
that thief.

57:03.974 --> 57:06.039
Oh, we're trying.

57:06.041 --> 57:08.907
Don't suppose you know where
he is, do you, Feathers?

57:08.909 --> 57:10.442
He's behind you.

57:11.274 --> 57:12.572
Sorry, what?

57:12.574 --> 57:14.173
Coo-eee!

57:14.175 --> 57:16.606
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

57:16.608 --> 57:17.940
Why don't you come on in?

57:17.942 --> 57:21.738
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

57:21.740 --> 57:24.572
Mysterious things have been
happening all over town.

57:24.574 --> 57:26.739
- Oh, yes?
- Strange characters

57:26.741 --> 57:28.974
turning up at every landmark
in that book.

57:28.976 --> 57:30.305
Are they?

57:30.307 --> 57:32.338
I don't know.

57:32.340 --> 57:34.007
Perhaps
it's just a coincidence.

57:34.009 --> 57:36.939
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

57:36.941 --> 57:39.238
Well, you're an artist, Mary,
like me.

57:39.240 --> 57:43.874
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

57:43.876 --> 57:46.440
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

57:46.442 --> 57:49.172
I think dear old Henry might
have a point.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.472
Do you?

57:50.474 --> 57:52.872
But I do have a little bit
of good news

57:52.874 --> 57:55.306
that might turn your frown
upside down.

57:55.308 --> 57:56.573
Oh, yes?

57:56.575 --> 57:58.506
It looks, fingers,
fingers, fingers,

57:58.508 --> 58:00.071
as though the funding
may be coming through

58:00.073 --> 58:01.238
for my one-man show.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.806
Oh. Right.

58:02.808 --> 58:04.505
It's an evening of monologue
and song,

58:04.507 --> 58:06.338
featuring some of
my better known characters.

58:06.340 --> 58:07.973
Would you like
a little preview?

58:07.975 --> 58:09.406
Um...

58:09.408 --> 58:14.673
Picture this scene. Darkness,
then suddenly spotlight, me,

58:14.675 --> 58:15.739
ping!

58:15.741 --> 58:18.540
<i>♪ Listen to

58:18.542 --> 58:21.706

58:21.708 --> 58:25.872
Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

58:25.874 --> 58:26.940
No. No, no, no.

58:26.942 --> 58:29.272
I suppose
it seems so unfair

58:29.274 --> 58:31.540
Paddington is in prison
and yet

58:31.542 --> 58:34.539
- life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

58:34.541 --> 58:38.172
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

58:38.174 --> 58:41.475
that man with the dazzling
blue eyes.

58:43.008 --> 58:44.239
I beg your pardon?

58:44.241 --> 58:47.506
The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

58:47.508 --> 58:50.575
Yes, but... how do you know
he had blue eyes?

58:51.107 --> 58:52.238
Hmm?

58:52.240 --> 58:54.374
It's just a pencil sketch.

58:58.942 --> 59:00.672
Ooh.

59:00.674 --> 59:04.408
Well, then I must have
colored him in.

59:05.408 --> 59:06.606
<i>Phoenix Buchanan?</i>

59:06.608 --> 59:08.706
He's a master of disguise.

59:08.708 --> 59:10.874
- She's gone mad.
- Think about it, Henry.

59:10.876 --> 59:13.440
Someone out there knows about
the Kozlova fortune, right?

59:13.442 --> 59:15.039
Alleged fortune.

59:15.041 --> 59:16.906
And Knuckles said we weren't
looking for a criminal gang.

59:16.908 --> 59:18.105
Knuckles?

59:18.107 --> 59:19.971
- Because there was no gang.
- It was one man.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.340
Feathers knew all along.

59:22.342 --> 59:24.639
- Feathers? Who's Feathers?
- Hmm?

59:24.641 --> 59:26.808
The parrot at the newsstand?

59:27.709 --> 59:28.973
No...

59:28.975 --> 59:31.273
Can we just return
to Planet Earth for a moment?

59:31.275 --> 59:32.606
Phoenix Buchanan is

59:32.608 --> 59:35.338
a highly respected,
award-winning actor,

59:35.340 --> 59:37.173
and a member of
our Platinum club.

59:37.175 --> 59:40.172
- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry.

59:40.174 --> 59:42.373
But let's just assume
I'm wrong, shall we?

59:42.375 --> 59:43.439
Okay.

59:43.441 --> 59:44.740
And that the fortune-teller,

59:44.742 --> 59:47.406
career criminal
and parrot are right.

59:47.408 --> 59:51.139
May I remind you that you
don't actually have any proof.

59:51.141 --> 59:54.709
Now, if anyone wants me,
I shall be putting up posters.

59:56.974 --> 59:58.040
He's right.

59:58.042 --> 01:00:00.773
Well, I believe you, Mary.

01:00:00.775 --> 01:00:05.373
Actors are some of
the most evil, devious people

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:06.971
on the planet.

01:00:06.973 --> 01:00:10.238
- Are they?
- They lie for a living.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.472
Crikey.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.340
- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?

01:00:13.342 --> 01:00:15.542
...we're gonna need
a foolproof plan.

01:00:23.341 --> 01:00:25.542
Hmm?

01:00:26.908 --> 01:00:29.375
- Paddington?
- Oh.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.308
Paddington.

01:00:36.107 --> 01:00:37.472
Knuckles?

01:00:37.474 --> 01:00:39.640
Got a proposition
for you, kid.

01:00:39.642 --> 01:00:42.039
Me and the boys have
been talking, and

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.339
seems to us,

01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:45.373
if you're gonna clear
your name,

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.738
you're gonna need our help.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.640
The Browns may mean well,
but...

01:00:48.642 --> 01:00:51.706
It takes a thief
to catch a thief.

01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:53.005
Oh.

01:00:53.007 --> 01:00:55.372
Now, if we could
figure a way out of here

01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:56.739
and hit the streets,

01:00:56.741 --> 01:00:58.672
we'd find this guy
soon enough.

01:00:58.674 --> 01:01:01.672
But that would mean... escape.

01:01:01.674 --> 01:01:04.372
It certainly would.
And we got a plan.

01:01:04.374 --> 01:01:07.338
But it's a four-man job,
so we need your help.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.938
What do you say, kid?

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.806
It's very kind of you,
Knuckles,

01:01:10.808 --> 01:01:12.605
but I don't think
Aunt Lucy would like

01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:15.506
the idea of us breaking out
of prison.

01:01:15.508 --> 01:01:17.772
The Browns will find
the real thief.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.938
I just need to be patient.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.639
You may not wanna hear this,
kid,

01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:26.741
but sooner or later
the Browns, well,

01:01:27.407 --> 01:01:29.271
they'll forget you.

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:31.072
They always do.

01:01:31.074 --> 01:01:35.205
They'll miss one visit.
Then two.

01:01:35.207 --> 01:01:37.972
Before you know it,

01:01:37.974 --> 01:01:40.773
you won't have a home
to go back to.

01:01:40.775 --> 01:01:44.240
You're wrong, Knuckles.
You're all wrong.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.939
The Browns aren't like that.

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:49.139
They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news,

01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:50.508
you'll see.

01:01:56.574 --> 01:01:58.005

So what's this for, darlings?
School newspaper?

01:02:04.709 --> 01:02:06.774
Yes. We thought the agent
of the Phoenix Buchanan

01:02:06.776 --> 01:02:08.073
would be really interesting.

01:02:08.075 --> 01:02:10.440
And you'd be right.
But I've got two minutes,

01:02:10.442 --> 01:02:12.072
so we better make it snappy.

01:02:12.074 --> 01:02:13.372
And I've only given you that

01:02:13.374 --> 01:02:15.372
because you've brought
breakfast.

01:02:15.374 --> 01:02:17.609
Nice buns, by the way.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.672
Here he comes.

01:02:21.674 --> 01:02:24.406
Hello, Joe. What a surprise.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:25.839
What are you doing here?

01:02:25.841 --> 01:02:27.106
Oh, you know,
posting letters.

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:28.306
How's Paddington?

01:02:28.308 --> 01:02:29.572
Oh, he's a tough wee bear.

01:02:29.574 --> 01:02:31.640
Yeah, he is.
Well, send him my best.

01:02:31.642 --> 01:02:35.409
Yes, I will.
Thank you, Joe. Bye-bye.

01:02:45.574 --> 01:02:47.806
Mr. Buchanan.

01:02:47.808 --> 01:02:51.006
So, when can we expect to see
Mr. Buchanan back on stage?

01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:53.707
Phoenix? Oh, I wouldn't
hold your breath, darling.

01:02:53.709 --> 01:02:55.672
No, no, no,
don't get me wrong.

01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:57.805
He's a terrific actor,

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.206
but there is a teensy
little problem.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:01.406
Really?

01:03:01.408 --> 01:03:03.440
He won't work
with other people.

01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:06.473
Thinks they dilute his talent.

01:03:06.475 --> 01:03:07.973
Miss Fanshaw.

01:03:07.975 --> 01:03:10.373
Oh, I must scoot.
We're having lunch

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:11.938
with a big Broadway producer.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.075
- Oh, where are you going?
- The Ritz, darling!

01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:18.042
Really nice buns.

01:03:26.308 --> 01:03:28.438
Well, good heavens. Come.

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:31.739
<i>The package
has been delivered.</i>

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:35.306
Repeat, the package
has been delivered.

01:03:35.308 --> 01:03:37.306
Barkridge's, no less.

01:03:37.308 --> 01:03:40.542
Lucky, lucky Phoenix.
Whoo!

01:03:45.873 --> 01:03:47.804
- Hello?
- <i>Phoenix.</i>

01:03:47.806 --> 01:03:50.406
Felicity!
What a lovely surprise.

01:03:50.408 --> 01:03:52.906
I was beginning to think
you'd lost my number.

01:03:52.908 --> 01:03:55.807
<i>I've got two minutes,
so we better make it snappy.</i>

01:03:56.409 --> 01:03:57.939
Okay.

01:03:57.941 --> 01:04:00.971
<i>We're having lunch
with a big Broadway producer.</i>

01:04:00.973 --> 01:04:05.606
Well, wonderful news.
Yes, yes. Where does one go?

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.606
<i>The Ritz, darling!</i>

01:04:07.608 --> 01:04:09.338
I am on my way.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.308
<i>Nice buns, by the way.</i>

01:04:12.442 --> 01:04:13.941
I beg your pardon?

01:04:16.407 --> 01:04:18.474
<i>Really nice buns.</i>

01:04:20.008 --> 01:04:21.639
Thank you, darling.

01:04:21.641 --> 01:04:23.639
I've never had any complaints

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:25.674
about
Mr. and Mrs. Botty-cheek.

01:04:26.408 --> 01:04:27.839
Yes.

01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:29.708
Gloves. Keys.

01:04:30.174 --> 01:04:32.338
And exit.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.841
Mary?

01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:00.675
Open the window.

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:07.238
- Hello, darling.
- Have you gone insane?

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.639
I know it's Phoenix
and I'm going to prove it.

01:05:09.641 --> 01:05:11.406
This is breaking and entering.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.408
We haven't broken anything.

01:05:15.107 --> 01:05:17.505
Why would Phoenix want
to steal a pop-up book?

01:05:17.507 --> 01:05:18.605
He's a millionaire!

01:05:18.607 --> 01:05:20.006
That's where you're wrong.

01:05:20.008 --> 01:05:21.472
He owes money
all over town. Look.

01:05:21.474 --> 01:05:23.737
So he's got a few bills.
I mean, everyone...

01:05:23.739 --> 01:05:25.804
Good grief, the man spends
a lot on face cream.

01:05:25.806 --> 01:05:27.372
He hasn't got
a penny to his name.

01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:30.840
Now come on. Let's find
that book and get out of here.

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:37.741
Cravat.

01:05:42.408 --> 01:05:44.072
- Well?
- Nothing.

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:45.506
We must be missing something.

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:46.972
Unless there's nothing
to find.

01:05:46.974 --> 01:05:49.073
Now can we please go?

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:51.239
- Oh. Look, Henry.
- What?

01:05:51.241 --> 01:05:52.539
The carpet.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.305
Yes, it's lovely.
I'll order a swatch.

01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:56.171
- Give me a leg-up.
- Oh...

01:05:56.173 --> 01:05:57.408
Quick, quick, quick.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:02.708
Yes!

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.272
A secret room.

01:06:09.274 --> 01:06:12.006
- It's an attic.
- Secret attic.

01:06:12.008 --> 01:06:13.606
It's an ordinary attic.

01:06:13.608 --> 01:06:15.239
Every house in the street
has one.

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:17.605
I mean, look, it's just
a perfectly normal...

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.739
Oh, my God, he's a weirdo.

01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:23.875
Look, Henry. The nun.
The thief. The king.

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:26.538
We were right!

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.440
Sorry. "We"?

01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:29.773
Well, I mean, I never...

01:06:32.207 --> 01:06:34.408
- Quick!
- Get down. Get down.

01:06:44.174 --> 01:06:46.941
Quite frankly ravishing.

01:06:49.341 --> 01:06:50.540
Hello?

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.708
Who goes there?

01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:57.409
Reveal yourself.

01:07:03.175 --> 01:07:04.474
Henry?

01:07:07.374 --> 01:07:09.571
Hello, Phoenix.

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:12.272
What on earth
are you doing here?

01:07:12.274 --> 01:07:14.871
I might ask you
the same thing.

01:07:14.873 --> 01:07:18.374
Well, I live here.
It's my house.

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:20.939
And I

01:07:20.941 --> 01:07:25.372
insure it. And for our
Platinum Club members,

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:28.538
we perform an annual
free home inspection

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.139
to verify your
security arrangements.

01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:32.974
In your pajamas?

01:07:33.874 --> 01:07:35.072
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:35.074 --> 01:07:36.738
With your wife?

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.572
So that all seems
pretty secure.

01:07:39.574 --> 01:07:41.305
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.
- Mary.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.173
Didn't hear you come in.

01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:45.505
She helps out when we're busy.

01:07:45.507 --> 01:07:48.938
Oh, well, that sounds
entirely plausible.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.805
Does it? Great.
Well, I'm delighted to say

01:07:51.807 --> 01:07:53.405
that everything
seems tickety-boo.

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:54.838
Wonderful.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.572
So, I'll nip back
to the office

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:58.406
and get the boys
to type that up ASAP.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.839
And we'll hope
to see you soon.

01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:00.938
Indeed.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.939
Perhaps next time
not in your pyjamas?

01:08:06.007 --> 01:08:09.374
- He's such a silly one.
- Ciao, now.

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.772
Oh, thank Larry it's there.

01:08:14.774 --> 01:08:18.772
Thank Larry, Johnny and
all the ghosts of the avenue.

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:19.971
Yeah, well, that was close,

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:21.438
- weren't it?
- Aye!

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:22.804
Too close, if you ask me.

01:08:22.805 --> 01:08:24.504
Hold your nerve, MacBeth!

01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:26.273
Screw your courage
to the sticking place!

01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:27.839
We are so nearly there.

01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:30.671
I have followed this lady
through the whole of London

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.939
and collected every one
of her clever little clues.

01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:36.938
Aye. But what do they mean?

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:39.537
It's just
a jumble of letters, ain't it?

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.272
Uh-huh.
They are not letters at all.

01:08:43.274 --> 01:08:45.837
They are musical notes.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.906
Indeed,
Poirot. And I believe I know

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:52.774
just where to play them.

01:08:55.274 --> 01:08:57.404
Hold it!

01:08:57.406 --> 01:09:00.173
That is an amazing story.

01:09:00.175 --> 01:09:02.970
But all you can actually prove

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:05.173
is Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.906
Bring me some hard evidence.

01:09:07.908 --> 01:09:09.471
Bring me the book
with his fingerprints on,

01:09:09.474 --> 01:09:11.005
and then you've got a case.

01:09:11.006 --> 01:09:14.506
But until then, there's
nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:17.504
Where is she go...
Where's she going?

01:09:17.506 --> 01:09:19.904
What do we do now?

01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:21.305
I don't know.

01:09:21.307 --> 01:09:24.872
Well, at least we can tell
Paddington we know who did it.

01:09:24.874 --> 01:09:27.173
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:09:27.175 --> 01:09:29.404
- We've missed visiting.
- Oh!

01:09:29.406 --> 01:09:30.675
Paddington.

01:10:58.074 --> 01:10:59.504
Paddington!

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.640
Aunt Lucy?

01:11:09.639 --> 01:11:12.440
- Aunt Lucy!
- Paddington.

01:11:15.073 --> 01:11:20.639
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be at home.

01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:23.504
I'm afraid
I don't have one anymore.

01:11:23.506 --> 01:11:26.307
You see, I'm in prison.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.740
And even the Browns
have forgotten me.

01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:39.608
Paddington?

01:11:43.807 --> 01:11:45.405
Knuckles.

01:11:45.407 --> 01:11:48.938
Tonight's the night.
We leave at midnight.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.038
You wanna clear your name,
it's now or never.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.507
You in?

01:11:54.707 --> 01:11:55.974
I'm in.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.404
Right. Time to call it
a night.

01:12:00.406 --> 01:12:02.472
Not much going on here anyway.

01:12:02.474 --> 01:12:05.341
They've been good
as gold recently.

01:12:13.374 --> 01:12:15.008
Lights out.

01:13:30.008 --> 01:13:31.042
Ah!

01:13:44.172 --> 01:13:45.440
Oh, sandwiches.

01:13:46.139 --> 01:13:47.805
Paddington.

01:13:47.807 --> 01:13:48.807
Coming.

01:14:35.573 --> 01:14:37.708
Good luck, little bear.

01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:49.038
This is the life, lads.

01:14:50.673 --> 01:14:52.473
Freedom!

01:15:07.307 --> 01:15:08.875
Bring her down, Spoon.

01:15:27.975 --> 01:15:31.671
There she is, boys.
Our ticket out of here.

01:15:31.673 --> 01:15:34.674
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

01:15:36.806 --> 01:15:38.437
Might as well
tell him, Knucks.

01:15:38.439 --> 01:15:39.738
Tell me what?

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.439
Aren't we going to clear
my name?

01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:45.738
Sorry, kid. Change of plan.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.137
What?

01:15:47.139 --> 01:15:50.004
- We're leaving the country.
- And you're coming with us.

01:15:50.006 --> 01:15:53.272
But... you lied to me.

01:15:53.274 --> 01:15:57.238
Oh, hey, now,
it wasn't like that.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.839
We were doing you a favor.

01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:01.537
If we told you the truth,
you'd never have come along,

01:16:01.539 --> 01:16:03.405
and it's better this way.

01:16:03.407 --> 01:16:08.638
We are gonna make
marmalade together.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.773
But I don't want to, Knuckles.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.370
I want to clear my name
and go home.

01:16:13.372 --> 01:16:16.507
And you said you'd help.
You promised.

01:16:21.407 --> 01:16:23.074
Sorry, kid.

01:16:24.339 --> 01:16:26.871
No can do.

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.940
Paddington!

01:16:30.373 --> 01:16:32.506
Let him go.

01:16:32.508 --> 01:16:34.974
If he wants to get
himself arrested,

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.775
that's his choice.

01:17:19.541 --> 01:17:20.938
<i>Hello.</i>

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.505
<i>You've reached
the Brown residence.</i>

01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:23.671
<i>We're not here now...</i>

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:25.271
<i>...but leave a message.</i>

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:30.672
Hello, it's me. Paddington.

01:17:30.674 --> 01:17:33.137
<i>I hope you don't mind
my calling.</i>

01:17:33.139 --> 01:17:34.471
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

01:17:34.473 --> 01:17:38.772
<i>I've broken out of prison
and, well,</i>

01:17:38.774 --> 01:17:41.271
<i>I suppose I'm on the run.</i>

01:17:41.273 --> 01:17:42.638
<i>I didn't really mean to,</i>

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.037
<i>but Knuckles said
that if we broke out</i>

01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:46.741
<i>he'd help clear my name,</i>

01:17:47.773 --> 01:17:50.638
<i>and then I could come home.</i>

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.974
But he's gone now
and I'm on my own.

01:17:55.607 --> 01:17:56.771
I don't really know why

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.404
I'm calling.

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:01.005
I suppose
I just wanted to say...

01:18:03.407 --> 01:18:04.675
...goodbye.

01:18:31.906 --> 01:18:34.138
- Hello?
- <i>Paddington?</i>

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.372
Yes. Yes, it's Paddington.

01:18:36.374 --> 01:18:38.304
<i>I'm so sorry I escaped,
Mrs. Brown,</i>

01:18:38.306 --> 01:18:39.537
<i>but I thought
you'd forgotten on me.</i>

01:18:39.539 --> 01:18:42.037
We'd never
forget you, Paddington.

01:18:42.039 --> 01:18:44.105
- Paddington?
- You're family.

01:18:44.107 --> 01:18:45.271
And we know who the thief was.

01:18:45.273 --> 01:18:46.438
It's Phoenix Buchanan.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.905
Mr. Buchanan?

01:18:47.907 --> 01:18:49.539
<i>But he's
disappeared into thin air.</i>

01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:51.072
We've been looking for him
at every landmark

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:53.772
- in that book.
- Every last page.

01:18:53.774 --> 01:18:55.907
"Where all your dreams
come true."

01:18:56.972 --> 01:18:58.472
Why do you say that?

01:18:58.474 --> 01:19:00.838
Oh, it was written on the
last page of the pop-up book.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.739
<i>Always made me think
of Aunt Lucy.</i>

01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:05.205
- Very bizarre.
- <i>Is it?</i>

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.705
I found that exact same phrase

01:19:06.707 --> 01:19:09.305
on a scrap of paper
in Phoenix's house.

01:19:09.307 --> 01:19:10.470
<i>Really?</i>

01:19:10.472 --> 01:19:12.571
I'm sure
I've seen that before.

01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:15.338
Look. "Where all your dreams
come true."

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.938
The organ?

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.671
That must be where Madame
Kozlova hid her fortune.

01:19:18.673 --> 01:19:19.937
Let's get to the fair.

01:19:19.939 --> 01:19:21.605
It's too late.
They're leaving today.

01:19:21.607 --> 01:19:23.171
From Paddington Station.

01:19:23.173 --> 01:19:24.605
At 6:35.

01:19:24.607 --> 01:19:25.805
There's still time.

01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:27.337
Paddington, head for
the station.

01:19:27.339 --> 01:19:29.472
<i>If we can find Phoenix
and get hold of that book,</i>

01:19:29.474 --> 01:19:31.070
<i>his fingerprints
will prove everything.</i>

01:19:31.072 --> 01:19:33.271
But that's miles away,
Mr. Brown. I'll...

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.038
I'll see you there.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.072
Clear the road.

01:19:41.074 --> 01:19:42.738
This is a refuse emergency.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.836
Sorry!

01:19:44.838 --> 01:19:48.737
<i>Fellow citizens, I've just
received intelligence.</i>

01:19:48.739 --> 01:19:52.837
<i>The bear has escaped
and may be heading this way.</i>

01:19:52.839 --> 01:19:55.271
<i>I have raised
the neighborhood panic level</i>

01:19:55.273 --> 01:19:56.770
<i>to "wild hysteria."</i>

01:19:56.772 --> 01:19:58.537
Get out of the way,
Mr. Curry!

01:19:58.539 --> 01:20:00.705
Paddington's not coming
this way!

01:20:00.707 --> 01:20:01.904
He's gonna clear his name.

01:20:01.906 --> 01:20:04.338
And we're gonna
bring him home!

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.705
<i>We don't want him here.</i>

01:20:05.707 --> 01:20:08.572
No, of course you don't.
You never have.

01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:10.638
As soon as you set eyes
on that bear,

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.606
you made up your mind
about him.

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:14.837
Well, Paddington's
not like that.

01:20:14.839 --> 01:20:16.639
He looks for the good
in all of us,

01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:18.937
and somehow he finds it.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.803
It's why he makes friends
wherever he goes.

01:20:21.805 --> 01:20:24.337
And it's why Windsor Gardens
is a happier place

01:20:24.339 --> 01:20:25.937
whenever he's around.

01:20:25.939 --> 01:20:29.204
He wouldn't hesitate
if any of us needed help.

01:20:29.206 --> 01:20:33.540
So stand aside, Mr. Curry,
because we're coming through!

01:20:42.739 --> 01:20:44.237
<i>Nice try, Brown.</i>

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.471
<i>Your plan
seems to have stalled.</i>

01:20:46.473 --> 01:20:48.104
<i>Like your vehicle.</i>

01:20:48.106 --> 01:20:51.305
<i>Try the choke. Go on, try the choke.
You're flooding it.</i>

01:20:51.307 --> 01:20:53.071
Clutch down, second gear,
Mr. Brown.

01:20:53.073 --> 01:20:54.638
What?

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.404
- After three. Three.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

01:20:56.406 --> 01:20:59.770
<i>You are illegally perambulating
on a public highway.</i>

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.171
Put your backs into it.

01:21:01.173 --> 01:21:03.039
<i>Do not push that vehicle.</i>

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:05.774
- Bring Paddington home.
- Thank you.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:22.839
Right, Paddington, stay low,
and remember, you're a bin.

01:21:26.772 --> 01:21:28.737
You're a bin.
You're a bin.

01:21:28.739 --> 01:21:31.337
Just an ordinary bin
going for a walk.

01:21:36.473 --> 01:21:39.637
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:42.637
Nothing to see here, Officer.
Just a bin.

01:21:42.639 --> 01:21:44.571
Hmm.

01:21:44.573 --> 01:21:46.440
Quite good being a bin.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.007
Gentlemen.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.737
Paddington!

01:22:25.739 --> 01:22:28.906
Mr. Brown!
Quickly, he's on board.

01:22:31.306 --> 01:22:33.637
Don't worry,
I'll handle it myself.

01:22:33.639 --> 01:22:35.605
We've gotta catch up
with that train.

01:22:35.607 --> 01:22:37.874
But how?

01:22:40.439 --> 01:22:42.073
I've got an idea.

01:22:43.473 --> 01:22:45.570
Good morning, madam. Sir.
Welcome on board.

01:22:45.572 --> 01:22:46.871
Morning. Thank you.

01:22:46.873 --> 01:22:48.404
May I offer you a glass
of champagne?

01:22:48.406 --> 01:22:50.204
Oh, thank you so much.
That's very kind.

01:22:50.206 --> 01:22:51.671
Very civilized, yes.

01:22:51.673 --> 01:22:54.004
Nice to have a break
after all I've been through

01:22:54.006 --> 01:22:56.238
with that beastly bear.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.937
Boiler pressure, 225.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:00.904
Water, half a glass.
Air brake, off.

01:23:00.906 --> 01:23:03.071
Nice work, J-Dog.

01:23:03.073 --> 01:23:04.671
My name's not J-Dog.

01:23:04.673 --> 01:23:08.604
It's Jonathan Brown.
And I like steam trains.

01:23:08.606 --> 01:23:10.970
- Oh, for goodness' sake.
- I'm so sorry.

01:23:10.972 --> 01:23:13.471
Get off. Stop it.

01:23:13.473 --> 01:23:14.970
Don't shush me, Gertrude.

01:23:14.972 --> 01:23:17.570
I have just been spilled upon
by a chilled liquid.

01:23:17.572 --> 01:23:21.407
Gerald, I want you to shush.

01:23:23.273 --> 01:23:24.838
Yes, Gertrude.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.271
<i>...seven o'clock.</i>

01:23:26.273 --> 01:23:28.439
<i>Here's the news from the BBC.</i>

01:23:28.441 --> 01:23:30.736
<i>Four convicts
made a daring escape</i>

01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:32.603
<i>from Portobello Prison
last night.</i>

01:23:32.605 --> 01:23:34.438
<i>The prisoners all appear to
have vanished</i>

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.137
<i>without a trace...</i>

01:23:36.139 --> 01:23:37.737
<i>...except Paddington Brown,</i>

01:23:37.739 --> 01:23:40.570
<i>who was seen boarding a fair
train bound for Bristol.</i>

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:42.104
<i>Police are closing in</i>

01:23:42.106 --> 01:23:44.503
<i>and expect to make
an arrest soon.</i>

01:23:45.906 --> 01:23:48.538
Poor little fella.

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:51.405
Must be somewhere down there
right now.

01:23:51.407 --> 01:23:53.872
Shouldn't we help him,
Knuckles?

01:23:53.874 --> 01:23:55.838
How?
We go back down there,

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.338
they won't just lock us up,
they'll throw away the key.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.939
I know but he's our friend.

01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:03.906
Stick to the plan.

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:08.673
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

01:24:31.306 --> 01:24:33.503
Well, Grandfather,

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:35.573
the moment of truth.

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:40.540
D.

01:24:42.173 --> 01:24:43.305
D.

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:46.572
A.

01:24:47.006 --> 01:24:48.007
A.

01:24:48.706 --> 01:24:50.771
The book.

01:24:54.207 --> 01:24:55.640
Ah.

01:24:58.907 --> 01:25:02.270
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

01:25:02.272 --> 01:25:04.837
- Paddington!
- He can't hear us.

01:25:04.839 --> 01:25:06.470
Can this thing go any faster?

01:25:06.472 --> 01:25:08.170
I can try
but I need more coal.

01:25:08.172 --> 01:25:09.271
I'm on it.

01:25:09.273 --> 01:25:11.205
Pull alongside.
I'm going across.

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:12.971
- I'll come with you.
- Judy...

01:25:12.973 --> 01:25:14.674
Just you try and stop us!

01:25:16.207 --> 01:25:17.506
Come on then!

01:25:52.471 --> 01:25:54.703
- Ready?
- Yep.

01:25:54.705 --> 01:25:55.707
Go!

01:26:07.472 --> 01:26:09.171
<i>Open your mind</i>

01:26:09.173 --> 01:26:10.806
<i>and your legs will follow.</i>

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.771
Mr. Brown!

01:26:19.773 --> 01:26:20.874
Mrs. Bird.

01:26:23.274 --> 01:26:24.473
C.

01:26:28.039 --> 01:26:30.872
And finally E.

01:26:34.505 --> 01:26:36.041
It works.

01:26:49.939 --> 01:26:51.839
Ooh.

01:26:55.407 --> 01:26:57.337
Hello.

01:26:57.339 --> 01:26:59.540
Aren't you pretty.

01:27:00.406 --> 01:27:04.272
West End here I come.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.074
Morning.

01:27:10.705 --> 01:27:11.838
No!

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.839
What was it? D. F.

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:16.573
D.

01:27:17.939 --> 01:27:19.070
Come back with that book.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:43.771
Where do you think
you're going, bear?

01:27:43.773 --> 01:27:48.771
It's a train. It comes to
an end, like all of us alas.

01:27:50.973 --> 01:27:51.974
Whoops.

01:27:54.473 --> 01:27:58.307
Exit bear,
pursued by an actor.

01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:02.439
Phoenix Buchanan.

01:28:03.438 --> 01:28:05.139
Mrs. Bird?

01:28:05.141 --> 01:28:07.637
Oh, so now you remember me?

01:28:07.639 --> 01:28:11.170
Well, I never. The cavalry.

01:28:11.172 --> 01:28:16.003
An old crone, a little girl
and an insurance man.

01:28:16.005 --> 01:28:17.204
What am I going to do?

01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:19.337
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:28:19.339 --> 01:28:21.403
- Mmm?
- I'm going to bloomin' well

01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:23.004
biff you on the nose.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.071
Not a very good idea.

01:28:26.338 --> 01:28:29.604
Stage combat, level four.

01:28:29.606 --> 01:28:32.571
Well, where I come from,
laddie,

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:35.470
they teach you never to bring
a knife to a gunfight.

01:28:36.806 --> 01:28:39.739
I think you'll find
that fires plastic darts.

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.671
So it does.

01:28:43.673 --> 01:28:46.674
Whereas this sword looks
very sharp.

01:28:48.174 --> 01:28:49.940
Back you go.
All of you, back.

01:28:59.974 --> 01:29:02.504
And for you, sir,
the jumbo pavlova.

01:29:02.506 --> 01:29:03.840
- Ah.
- Enjoy.

01:29:06.173 --> 01:29:10.507
Oh, hello, Your Honor.
The hair is looking lovely.

01:29:15.107 --> 01:29:16.772
Paddington!

01:29:16.774 --> 01:29:17.974
Mrs. Brown!

01:29:20.373 --> 01:29:22.838
I've got an idea.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:27.041
Good. Good. Excellent.
Now for your furry friend.

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:39.840
Slow down, Jonathan.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:48.104
Coo-ee!

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:50.440
What a clever little bear.

01:29:55.405 --> 01:29:58.436
Don't worry.
I know a wee trick

01:29:58.438 --> 01:30:01.006
Harry Houdini used to do.

01:30:16.439 --> 01:30:18.774
Jump, Paddington!
I'll catch you.

01:30:20.372 --> 01:30:21.572
No!

01:30:22.905 --> 01:30:24.572
Whoa!

01:30:34.807 --> 01:30:36.539
Bye-bye, bear.

01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:54.974
Bullseye!

01:31:15.973 --> 01:31:18.137
Stop the train, Jonathan!

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.606
Let's go, lads.

01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:31.437
Knuckles, you came back.

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.537
Can't make marmalade
on my own now, can I?

01:33:33.539 --> 01:33:35.170
Thank you, everyone.

01:33:35.172 --> 01:33:36.439
Paddington?

01:33:37.439 --> 01:33:38.704
He's burning up.

01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:40.606
Better get
the little fella to bed.

01:33:42.339 --> 01:33:43.638
- Mom!
- Paddington!

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.004
He's not well.

01:33:45.006 --> 01:33:47.037
Don't worry,
he's gonna be fine.

01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:48.774
Aren't you, little buddy?

01:34:12.572 --> 01:34:13.936
Paddington!

01:34:13.938 --> 01:34:16.971
- Where am I?
- Take it easy now.

01:34:16.973 --> 01:34:21.404
You gave us a wee scare,
but you're home now.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:23.738
- Home?
- That's right. Look.

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.936
The police realized they'd
made a terrible mistake.

01:34:25.938 --> 01:34:28.804
Phoenix Buchanan
has been arrested, and,

01:34:28.806 --> 01:34:32.537
I might add, is no longer
a member of our Platinum Club.

01:34:32.539 --> 01:34:35.903
- Then...
- You're a free bear.

01:34:35.905 --> 01:34:39.137
- How long have I been asleep?
- Three days.

01:34:39.139 --> 01:34:41.537
Three days! But that means...

01:34:41.539 --> 01:34:43.236
It's Aunt Lucy's birthday.

01:34:43.238 --> 01:34:45.404
And I never sent her anything.

01:34:45.406 --> 01:34:46.804
It's all right, Paddington.

01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:48.936
But it isn't all right,
Mrs. Brown.

01:34:48.938 --> 01:34:53.471
You see, Aunt Lucy did so
much for me when I was a cub.

01:34:53.473 --> 01:34:56.370
Without her I'd never
have come to London.

01:34:56.372 --> 01:34:59.069
And I suppose
all I ever really wanted

01:34:59.071 --> 01:35:01.137
was to make her proud.

01:35:01.139 --> 01:35:03.369
But now she's going to wake up
on her birthday

01:35:03.371 --> 01:35:04.737
with no present

01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:07.070
and think
I've let her down completely.

01:35:07.072 --> 01:35:11.903
Oh, you great goose,
she won't think that at all.

01:35:11.905 --> 01:35:13.040
Won't she?

01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:15.639
Come with us.

01:35:17.772 --> 01:35:20.806
Here he is!

01:35:27.273 --> 01:35:30.671
- What are you all doing here?
- We wanted to say thank you.

01:35:30.673 --> 01:35:31.902
Thank you?

01:35:31.904 --> 01:35:33.003
For everything
you've done for us.

01:35:34.173 --> 01:35:36.204
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have met.

01:35:36.206 --> 01:35:38.069
You helped me pass my exam.

01:35:38.071 --> 01:35:40.304
I would be permanently locked
out of my house.

01:35:41.706 --> 01:35:44.969
I'd say you've rather a lot
to be proud of.

01:35:44.971 --> 01:35:47.337
And when we heard
that the police wanted

01:35:47.339 --> 01:35:48.769
the popping book
for evidence,

01:35:48.771 --> 01:35:52.438
we thought we'd find
Aunt Lucy another present.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.003
So we all
clubbed together.

01:35:54.005 --> 01:35:56.970
I pulled in a few favors
from my old Air Force chums.

01:35:56.972 --> 01:35:59.538
And we think
she's going to love it.

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.203
But... what is it?

01:36:02.205 --> 01:36:03.571
You wanted to get that book

01:36:03.573 --> 01:36:06.004
so Aunt Lucy could see London,
didn't you?

01:36:06.006 --> 01:36:07.704
It was always her dream.

01:36:07.706 --> 01:36:11.969
Well, we thought,
why look at London in a book

01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:14.371
when she could see
the real thing?

01:36:17.406 --> 01:36:19.540
Why don't you go
and answer that?

01:36:36.706 --> 01:36:38.073
Oh...

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.707
Paddington.

01:36:45.039 --> 01:36:47.440
Happy birthday, Aunt Lucy.

01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:54.590

Phoenix Buchanan,

you have proved yourself
to be a heinous criminal

01:38:11.672 --> 01:38:15.604
and a disgrace to the noble

I sentence you to ten years,

01:38:19.106 --> 01:38:24.739

your time behind bars wisely.
