WEBVTT

02:04.291 --> 02:06.084
Yes, Mr. Cavanaugh?

02:09.379 --> 02:11.632
Why don't you answer me?

02:27.064 --> 02:28.982
What is it, Mr. Cavanaugh?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.722
Mr. Cavanaugh?

03:44.099 --> 03:46.768
J“ do something to me

04:09.624 --> 04:11.918
ladies and gentlemen,
with 11 seconds left in the game,

04:12.043 --> 04:13.843
Peter krizaniac has committed
his fourth foul.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.381
The score is drover 71, DeWitt 70.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.926
For Christ's sake, maniac,
get your head outta your ass, will you?

04:20.051 --> 04:21.595
We're gonna blow this game!

04:21.720 --> 04:24.806
Go team, go! Go team, go!

04:37.027 --> 04:39.613
We got four fouls. He'll choke up.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.073
When we get the ball,
I want a simple play down court.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.788
Go, team! Let's do this!

04:51.583 --> 04:53.668
Look at me, man.
What the hell's going on?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.880
- You're letting us down.
- Ok.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.925
Look at me! Whatever's bothering you,
we'll talk about it later.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
Just give me 11 seconds.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.229
J“ love me, love me,
love me, love me, love

05:12.354 --> 05:16.358

05:44.845 --> 05:48.640

05:48.765 --> 05:51.893
j“ c'mon, do something to me... j“

05:54.271 --> 05:58.316
what a ballgame. A basket by Peter
'maniac' krizaniac in the final seconds.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.278
DeWitt will go on to the tac tournament.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.370
Yeah!

06:11.413 --> 06:12.664
Hey.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.129
Hey.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.047
What's the matter?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.508
Nothing.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.180
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Talk about what?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.893
Once again the final score:
DeWitt 72, drovers 71.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.979
So, until next Tuesday night's
championship game at 7:50,

06:36.104 --> 06:39.316
'this is Charlie kaiser,
the voice of DeWitt basketball.

06:39.441 --> 06:43.194
'And don't forget to be with me tomorrow
night for the annual wdbx scavenger hunt.'

06:43.320 --> 06:44.529
hey, pryor.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.158
How about a cheer for our heroic boys?

06:48.283 --> 06:52.704
That's what we love about you, pryor,
your sense of enthusiasm!

06:52.829 --> 06:56.833
You'd like it better if I ran around and
made an asshole of myself in a bear suit?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.252
You know, that's an idea for you, pryor.

07:02.589 --> 07:07.052
Hey, man.
Pryor's going to take over my bear suit.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.804
Lay off, Benson,
I've had enough of your bullshit!

07:09.930 --> 07:11.806
I told you, it's nothin'.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.310
God, I wish you believed that,
cos it was nothin'.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.022
- She's just a girl.
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.859
- You think I've never been dumped before?
- Not that I've noticed, no.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.196
Well, I have, plenty of times.
I just don't go around telling everybody.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.365
What am I supposed to do?

07:29.240 --> 07:33.495
I couldn't think of nothin' else
out there tonight. Damn!

07:33.620 --> 07:36.081
You've gotta pull yourself together, man.

07:36.206 --> 07:40.293
- Sure, but what if pryor finds out?
- So, he'll find out.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.754
I know, I know.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.049
I guess I'll have to break it to him easy.
I don't really want to hurt him.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.677
Well... then, why?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.597
I just couldn't help myself!

07:53.306 --> 07:55.392
Benson is just too much!

07:55.517 --> 07:58.770
He kept it up forever!
It hurts when I sit down!

07:58.895 --> 08:01.564
- God, Sheila, he's your cousin!
- Second cousin.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.610
Down to action!
Let's bring on the main attraction.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.449
Oh, my little super-stud!

08:11.574 --> 08:15.203
You gonna leave some of the chickadees
for the rest of the lowlifes?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.164
- If you ask politely, yes.
- Oh!

08:18.289 --> 08:20.917
I mean, it's been Teddy for two years.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.087
Don't you even get curious
about how it is with somebody else?

08:24.212 --> 08:26.923
I'll bet Teddy does.

08:27.048 --> 08:32.012
Teddy knows my limit.
He knows just how much I'll put up with.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.347
Hey, coach!

08:34.472 --> 08:37.517
Great game, guys.
I didn't wanna coach at notre dame anyway!

08:37.642 --> 08:39.602
What the hell!

08:39.728 --> 08:42.939
I'll send my wife down there.
She'll do a betterjob moving the guys.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.943
Now, hey, enjoy yourselves tonight.
It was a great win.

08:47.068 --> 08:51.072
But don't wear yourselves out helping the
sorority ladies with the scavenger hunt.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.700
Ok!

08:53.825 --> 08:57.912
Hold it! By the way,
11 o'clock sharp, practice tomorrow.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.415
- No baloney, be there.
- Ok.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.043
What a drag!

09:03.168 --> 09:05.462
Practice? Now, that is depressing.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.924
What does he mean
about helping the sorority girls out?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.343
We can if we want, can't we?

09:13.511 --> 09:17.766
Bostwick, sometimes, you know,
you're really a nerd.

09:20.852 --> 09:25.315
Aargh! I'm hit, Ralph! Ralph, I'm hit!

09:25.440 --> 09:27.400
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

09:27.525 --> 09:29.861
Helicopter, seven o'clock!

09:39.412 --> 09:43.291
J“ we got places to go!
Places to go! J“

09:43.416 --> 09:46.127
oh, here comes the blues brothers!

09:50.048 --> 09:51.758
Oh, god!

09:51.883 --> 09:55.261
- Hi, baby!
- Richter scale!

09:55.762 --> 10:00.433
Oh, yes, sports fans,
the momentum burn on the hardwood floor

10:00.558 --> 10:03.228
of the legendary
DeWitt college campus tonight!

10:03.353 --> 10:06.523
When the incomparable maniac krizaniac

10:06.648 --> 10:12.779
and the legendary, quintessential
Theodore ratliff donned up the motors

10:12.904 --> 10:16.616
and snatched victory
from the jaws of defeat.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.451
- Snatch!
- And... and... and...

10:18.576 --> 10:21.788
- Meanwhile, I was confused because...
- What?

10:21.913 --> 10:25.250
- I don't know anything about basketball.
- You don't know nothing?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.627
- But I kept going.
- Damn, y'all!

10:29.129 --> 10:34.384
Hey, damned be he
who cries out first.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.511
Lay off, macduff!

10:36.636 --> 10:40.014
Ah, hey, are you taking
an English drama course?

10:40.140 --> 10:45.061
Oh, mata hari has learned our secret.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.314
A-ha, our flies are open to you!
Aargh!

10:49.482 --> 10:53.361
And your parents thought they were wasting
money sending you guys to college?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.739
So, you guys planning on coming
to the big party tonight?

10:56.865 --> 11:00.702
Ha! We never miss a party,
do we, hagan?

11:00.827 --> 11:03.246
Are you kidding?
Besides the scavenger hunt

11:03.371 --> 11:06.166
and the performance on the hard wood
tonight, fellas... ha-ha-ha!

11:06.291 --> 11:07.851
It will be the event of the weekend.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.795
- Oh, indeed! It's the event.
- You dressing up?

11:12.380 --> 11:16.301
You know, I'm glad you asked that question
because I am going as beaver cleaver.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.596
Dancer?
He's gonna cleave the beaver!

11:19.721 --> 11:22.599
Oh, no! You're disgusting!

11:22.724 --> 11:24.642
- He's disgusting.
- Disgusting.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.270
- I am revolting! Ha!
- Revolting!

11:27.395 --> 11:30.023
Major Lee revulsion!

11:30.148 --> 11:32.442
Beaver! Beaver at six o'clock!

11:32.567 --> 11:35.069
- Part, beaver.
- Horny! Horny! Horny! Horny!

11:35.195 --> 11:37.030
Oh, get out!

11:37.697 --> 11:39.449
Lions and tigers and beaver!

11:39.574 --> 11:43.203
Lions and tigers and beaver!
Lions and tigers and beaver!

12:14.359 --> 12:16.277
Where the hell have you been?

12:16.402 --> 12:19.739
I got the whole grave dug by myself!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.825
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.083
Let's plant this nut Cavanaugh and split!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.797
This is the guy who killed
that college security guard's daughter.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.591
He just hung himself at the asylum.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.720
His sister's the one
who's paying us to Bury him.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.149
- Here, have a drink.
- Ok.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.611
C'mon, let's get this job finished.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.658
And get outta here.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.537
Ugh! Aargh!

13:10.248 --> 13:12.041
Ugh!

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
Oh, no!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.861
Wow, wow, wow! What a ballgame!

13:39.986 --> 13:42.071
Old Charlie here would like
to dedicate the start

13:42.196 --> 13:46.034
of 56 hours of solid old gold music
to the bears,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.910
for they are solid gold.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.204
Yes, sir, solid gold.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.207
And away we go-woah-woah!

13:53.333 --> 13:55.710
- Barney!
- There he is!

13:56.669 --> 13:58.212
Hey, hey, hey. Lookit, iookit, iookit.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.299
I know I'm beautiful
but you've gotta control yourself, woman.

14:01.424 --> 14:06.220
You did it, kid. You won the game!
Oh, jeez, I'm so proud of you.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.849
Hey, so what does the hero wanna eat, huh?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.643
Well, let's take a look. All right...

14:13.394 --> 14:16.606
Four double cheeseburgers,
two fries, two rings,

14:16.731 --> 14:20.151
two maximum cokes,
one stupendous root beer,

14:20.276 --> 14:23.112
one small chocolate shake
and a jellied doughnut.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.323
Now, for the main course.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.201
What are you gonna have for dessert, huh?
A stomach pump?

14:29.369 --> 14:33.122
- What's with all this food?
- Now, now, Barney. I'm a growing boy.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.917
Oh, yeah? What are you growing, huh?
A twin?

14:36.042 --> 14:39.045
Hey, do you think the world's ready
for another ratliff?

14:39.170 --> 14:42.131
I don't think the world is ready
for this ratliff.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.550
- Where's your partner in crime?
- Who, maniac?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.220
He's back at the table with Lynn.

14:47.345 --> 14:51.682
Hey, maniac!
Way to go! Way to go!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.602
Barney, Barney, I need food.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.773
Come on! Get outta here!
Get outta here!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.359
- I'll call you when it's ready.
- Ok.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.530
'Yowzer! That's playin' it like it is!'

15:05.655 --> 15:08.741
and now for all you good people getting
ready for your big scavenger hunt,

15:08.866 --> 15:12.078
here's the lovin' spoonful
with "do you believe in magic"?

15:12.203 --> 15:15.456
I said, "do you believe in magic?"

15:16.374 --> 15:18.209
C'mon, Mike.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.253
I can tell when something's bothering you.

15:20.378 --> 15:24.549
Bothering me?
Ok, there's something bothering me.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.719
- You're bothering me.
- What have I done?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.639
You can't think of anything?
You don't know?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.225
Well, then,
I guess there must be nothing wrong.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.186
You know, Mike,
sometimes you can get very weird.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.355
And you're getting worse lately.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.150
You don't understand me, do you?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.153
That's ok.
I'm used to being misunderstood.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.197
I can tell when something's bugging you.

15:48.322 --> 15:52.535
- All right, what about Benson?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.330
Come on! Don't bullshit me!
You know what I'm talking about.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.085
- Hey, hey, we've got company.
- Oh.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.131
You know you're gonna drive Barney crazy.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.885
Oh, that's not a drive, that's a putt.
Besides, she loves it!

16:09.010 --> 16:10.553
I'll tell y'all one thing.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.806
She's a hell of a lot better
than that old witch we had last year.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.975
- Damn!
- You mean Mrs. Gates?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.227
No, no, he means Mrs. Bates.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.147
- The woman in psycho, remember?
- No.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.592
Hey, maniac, come on,
show Lynn your Mrs. Bates impression.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.735
Oh, come on!

16:25.860 --> 16:28.571
- All right, catch this.
- Ok.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.782
Mrs. Bates? Mrs. Bates?
Norman's calling you.

16:31.908 --> 16:37.288
You guys are definitely strange!

16:37.413 --> 16:43.127
No. No, we're not. We're just typical
victims of a society gone berserk!

16:43.252 --> 16:45.129
Aargh! Oooh!

16:47.215 --> 16:48.716
Hey, hey, hey, gang.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.260
- Hey, thank you, Barney.
- Great service! What's the damage?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.471
Your money's no good here.
This one's on Mac.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.723
- Mac the cop bought it?
- Yeah.

16:57.433 --> 17:01.020
That's funny, I always figured
he didn't like students very much.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.649
- Well, let's eat.
- Yeah, let's do it.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.944
Hey, hey, hey, all you Jimmy Dean types.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.322
Come on out, because tonight's the night
for you old beatniks,

17:11.447 --> 17:14.033
Bobby-soxers and flower children.

17:14.158 --> 17:18.788
Remember the big golden oldies party
at the gamma house.

17:18.913 --> 17:22.875
'I said at the gamma house. Yeah!'

17:23.751 --> 17:27.421
it's the sheriff of Nottingham
and the fair maid Marion.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.591
- Right, hit me, cowboy.
- Ok.

17:31.259 --> 17:34.095
Hey! Watch it!

17:36.222 --> 17:39.267
- Come on, sit down, Lynnie.
- Cool out, guys.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.812
A little Jack Daniels never hurt anybody.
Have a sip, come on.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.398
More, more, more!

17:45.523 --> 17:47.942
- Oh, gimme that.
- Ugh.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.361
Gotta drink it like a man.

17:50.486 --> 17:54.782
Don't get my costume wet!

17:56.075 --> 18:00.121
- Are you guys ready to go to the party?
- About in a quarter of an hour.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.416
This is your party, little darlin'!

18:03.541 --> 18:07.336
C'mon! You guys want to sit around here
and play? I'll call a babysitter.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.506
Hey, can she be topless?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.550
- Of course.
- Woo!

18:12.675 --> 18:16.304
- I'll see you later.
- Come on, have another drink. One more.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.723
A little more, a little more.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.020
What a pig! Ooh, look at that!

18:24.562 --> 18:25.896
Watch out for the boogieman.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.774
Any boogieman would make
a better date than you, honey.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.696
- That took some thinking.
- Ah, that was real intelligent.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.823
J“ every party has a pooper

18:35.948 --> 18:38.409
J“ that's why we invited you

18:38.534 --> 18:41.162
j“ party pooper... j“

19:39.720 --> 19:41.681
Ralph! Someone's chasing me.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.475
- Yeah, it was me.
- What?

19:45.643 --> 19:48.062
Uh... you dropped this.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.313
Oh!

19:49.438 --> 19:51.399
Oh, thank you.

19:52.483 --> 19:56.070
Uh... I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm really sorry.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.161
I'd really like to go in with you
to the party.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.248
I... didn't bring a girl.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.583
Oh, sure.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.044
You know, you really scared me.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.338
You know, girls shouldn't be
out at night alone.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.842
I'm beginning to find that out.
Let's go.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.732
J“ I'm alive!

20:32.857 --> 20:36.318
J“ and I'm breathin' clean, fresh air today
I'm alive!

20:41.490 --> 20:42.825
J“ I'm alive!

20:42.950 --> 20:46.620
J“ who cares if my hair
is a little bit long, I'm alive!

20:51.459 --> 20:53.085
J“ I'm alive!

20:53.210 --> 20:56.464
J“ and I'm doin' my thing
and singin' my song, I'm alive!

21:21.322 --> 21:23.657
Get in here! Get in here!

21:25.493 --> 21:28.078
In there!

21:28.204 --> 21:29.872
Get in there!

21:30.873 --> 21:33.542
- Hi, boys.
- Janey!

21:33.667 --> 21:36.253
Hey, baby! Let me check your mileage!

21:36.378 --> 21:39.465
Woo, yeah! You look hot!

21:39.590 --> 21:41.967
- Hey, Jane, you like this guy?
- Yeah.

21:42.092 --> 21:46.013
- You have got him! You've won the prize!
- I got him? What's he supposed to be?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.850
He is the result
of one of my bad sex experiments.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.647
What will modern science think of next?

21:55.523 --> 21:56.607
Woo!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.943
Eat her up, baby!

21:59.068 --> 22:01.737
You're bad! You gone bad!

22:02.863 --> 22:04.740
Heel! Heel!

22:05.533 --> 22:08.911
Woah! Bad boy. Come on!

22:09.036 --> 22:12.414
Walked in and I spied a girl
named Sheila.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.836
- I walked up and said, "can I feel ya?"
- Oh, baby!

22:16.961 --> 22:20.756
She said with a stink,
"Teddy, get me a drink."

22:20.881 --> 22:23.884
And I said,
"I don't think so. I'll see ya."

22:24.927 --> 22:28.681
- Can I go get you a drink?
- Teddy, you can get me more than a drink.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.475
Oh, I'll go see what they have
at the hors d'oeuvres bar.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.269
Oh, please do.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.062
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.989
J“ yummy, yummy, yummy
I got love in my tummy... j“

22:45.114 --> 22:47.491
oh, maniac.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.619
Like, I really love
to watch you make a pass.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.122
At basketball.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.083
Maniac!

22:58.335 --> 23:00.170
Excuse me a sec.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.423
Leslie! Leslie!

23:04.216 --> 23:06.927
Um... can I talk to you a second?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.763
J“ ooh, love, you're sweeter
sweeter than sugar

23:09.889 --> 23:15.185
j“ ooh, love, I won't let you go... j“

23:18.355 --> 23:22.568
- I thought we were gonna talk.
- I'm just a little smashed.

23:24.862 --> 23:28.407
Well, I never could compete
with Jack Daniels, basketball

23:28.532 --> 23:30.242
and Teddy ratliff.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.494
Sorry, Pete.

23:35.289 --> 23:41.670
He-he-he! Tell these little mucous
membranes about Dickie Cavanaugh!

23:41.795 --> 23:45.215
Uh, I want you to meet
Dickie Cavanaugh.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.928
In many ways,
he was a lot like you boys.

23:50.054 --> 23:54.934
He was young, semi-literate
and he was an American.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.020
Then one night, they took old Dickie
out into the woods.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.814
Dickie came back.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.276
But his mind just kinda stayed out there.

24:04.401 --> 24:08.113
They had to take him up to the loony bin
in ol' Weston hill.

24:09.156 --> 24:14.495
He's been there ever since, just
screamin' and a-hollerin' all night long.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.332
Think about it, fellas.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.046
C'mon, hagan,
let's go drink some women.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.548
Oh, drink women!

24:26.674 --> 24:30.010
Bye, fellas.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.554
Bye.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.893
- Did you hear that?
- Do you think it's true?

24:38.018 --> 24:41.188
- It's a bunch of shit!
- What do you know?

24:41.313 --> 24:45.526
My brother went here six years ago and
they tried to dump the same stuff on him.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.944
- Oh, yeah?
- Really?

24:47.069 --> 24:50.864
He said... he said this guy,
Dickie Cavanaugh, did flip out.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.157
Yeah?

24:52.282 --> 24:54.702
But it had nothing to do
with the bear ritual.

24:54.827 --> 24:59.498
- He got hung up on some cheerleader.
- Gotta have a little bit...

24:59.623 --> 25:01.625
- And then he killed her...
- Killed her?

25:01.750 --> 25:04.545
- When she dumped him for another guy.
- Oh, shit.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.673
He did it right in the middle
of the scavenger hunt.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.718
- Phew!
- Come here. See that girl there?

25:10.843 --> 25:14.221
Patty macvey. She was Mac's daughter.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.015
- Who?
- Mr. Macvey.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.018
He's head of campus security
that's always poking his nose around.

25:19.143 --> 25:22.438
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I'm gonna check out the action.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.065
- Yeah, good luck.
- Catch you later.

25:33.365 --> 25:37.202
- Ralph, I never saw you dance before.
- Ha, it's the beer.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.914
- You want some cherry lip balm?
- Nah.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.959
Hey, Ralph, go like that.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.420
- What?
- Go like that. Go like that.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.256
Just a second, you got something right...

25:50.382 --> 25:52.551
- Ugh.
- Ralph, are you ok?

25:52.676 --> 25:56.263
Ralph! That was like real insane.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.653
It was a riot! I wish I'd had my camera
with me, I would have taken a photo.

26:11.779 --> 26:16.158
Stick it right up on the w... who is it?
I like it! I've been waiting for...

26:16.283 --> 26:19.745
Benson! God! Gross me out!

26:19.870 --> 26:22.206
Cool yourjets! God!

26:24.208 --> 26:26.168
Excuse me, Teddy.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.712
- Listen, can I ask you a question?
- Sure, kid. What is it?

26:28.837 --> 26:32.633
Well, we were just wondering if you could
tell us anything about Dickie Cavanaugh.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.343
- Who?
- Dickie Cavanaugh.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.012
He murdered that girl a long time ago
and got put away for it.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.807
Least, that's the way I heard it.
She dumped him or something.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.102
Look, it didn't have anything to do
with the bear in hell week, did it?

26:43.227 --> 26:46.480
Nah, kid, just relax.
Dickie was crazy anyway.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.362
Excuse me, I've got some business
to take care of.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.369
Ooh! Excuse me!

27:00.494 --> 27:03.747
- Hey, nice party, huh?
- Oh, lots of people.

27:04.373 --> 27:08.460
I'm, uh... Teddy ratliff.
I'm captain of the basketball team.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.921
Hi, I'm dawn Sorenson.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.549
And I couldn't care less.

27:13.674 --> 27:16.927
Ok, score one for you.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.056
- Sorry.
- But, uh... don't you feel it in the air?

27:21.181 --> 27:24.309
It's destiny. We were meant to meet.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.688
Uh... I don't think so.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.567
If you don't believe me,
you can ask him.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.655
- Who's him?
- That's my boyfriend.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.574
His name is bud Remington.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.742
I'm sure you've heard of his family.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.746
Oh, yeah.
The New York remingtons.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.958
They own company
after company and, uh...

27:48.083 --> 27:51.128
From the looks of him,
one of them must be a distillery.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.048
- Cheap shot.
- Score one. Even.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.051
- You got it.
- Ok.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.221
C'mon! Your turn, jock-pits!

28:01.346 --> 28:05.267
Ha-ha! Jock-pits opens for one shirt.

28:05.392 --> 28:09.271
Oh, god, dancer. You skunk!

28:09.396 --> 28:11.440
You're wearing a bra!

28:12.608 --> 28:15.319
- And I thought you were liberated.
- Well, tootsie.

28:16.069 --> 28:20.282
- I'd never get across campus without it.
- Well, what if we lose everything?

28:20.407 --> 28:22.367
What do we do next?

28:22.492 --> 28:24.828
Oh, god!

28:26.121 --> 28:28.790
- Oh, no!
- What if we lose everything?

28:28.916 --> 28:30.918
What do we do next?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.295
Well, I plead the fifth.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.840
I refuse to answer on the grounds
I may inseminate myself.

28:44.848 --> 28:49.561
J“ do you believe in magic
in a young girl's heart...? J“

28:50.312 --> 28:52.940
easy. Pryor's right over there.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.400
I don't want to make him look foolish.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.241
- When are you gonna tell him?
- Tonight.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.203
I wanna break it to him real easy.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.377
- Just don't be easy with me.
- Mm-mm.

29:16.797 --> 29:19.299
Benson. Psst, psst.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.343
Lose some of the hair.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.431
J“ your feet start tapping
and you can't seem to find

29:26.556 --> 29:30.978
j“ how you got there
so you just blow your mind... j“

29:37.025 --> 29:40.612
So, um, what are you
and little Iggy doing tomorrow night?

29:40.737 --> 29:44.866
Iggy tomorrow night? We're gonna be
listening for them clues tomorrow night.

29:44.992 --> 29:48.996
Oh, well, that's just great because
I'm gonna be in one of my club meetings

29:49.121 --> 29:53.000
and I was wondering if you might be able
to assist me, the two of you.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.837
Are you kidding?
Me and Iggy, we can help you out!

29:56.962 --> 30:00.257
- Well, that would be great.
- We could sniff out the clues

30:00.799 --> 30:02.759
what is this stuff with Benson?

30:03.552 --> 30:06.638
You come here with me?
You get it on with him?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.766
You don't even talk to me?

30:12.185 --> 30:14.229
Please don't start now.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.398
Listen to me.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.359
I'm not gonna let that creep
take you away from me.

30:19.484 --> 30:24.531
- You got that?
- Reel it in, pryor. You don't own me!

30:25.574 --> 30:27.909
Really? We'll see.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.082
Get off of me! Get off of me!

30:39.588 --> 30:41.173
You little bitch.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.427
You just take what you can get.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.181
All of you, you're nothing
but a bunch of whores.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.602
I won't forget this.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.691
Are you all right?

31:01.568 --> 31:03.862
He always was a little strange.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.115
- He's a lunatic.
- No, no, no. This is different.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.621
I think you should look
behind your shoulder.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.292
- Come on, lover boy.
- Lynn! Have you met my cousin?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.921
Dawn. Dawn Sorenson.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.424
- Come on. Let's go. Come on, lover boy!
- My cousin dawn Sorenson?

31:27.969 --> 31:29.888
Photo time!

31:32.057 --> 31:36.353
Get up! Get hot!
Get the sand out of your ass!

31:36.478 --> 31:40.899
Get wasted! Get tasted!
Get up and smoke some grass!

31:41.024 --> 31:44.319
If you don't get pregnant
or end up in the slammer,

31:44.444 --> 31:48.115
you can join our sorority,
and be in kappa gamma!

31:52.077 --> 31:54.413
Till tomorrow,
or should I say later today,

31:54.538 --> 31:56.748
this is old Charlie kaiser wrapping it up.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.293
Now all you good people
catch some sleep for the hunt tonight.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.129
Be mellow.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.755
Be happy.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.882
Get high.

32:18.812 --> 32:23.191
J“ hot town, summer in the city
back of my neck gettin' dirty and gritty

32:23.316 --> 32:27.571
j“ been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city

32:27.696 --> 32:29.656
j“ all around, people looking half dead

32:29.781 --> 32:33.243
j“ walking on the sidewalk,
hotter than a match head

32:33.368 --> 32:35.721
J“ but at night it's a different world...

32:35.745 --> 32:37.456
Yeah?

32:41.835 --> 32:43.628
Who is it?

32:47.841 --> 32:50.135
J“ in the summer, in the city...

32:50.260 --> 32:51.845
Wait a sec.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.019
Who is it? How are ya?

33:04.524 --> 33:06.401
J“ but at night it's a different world

33:06.526 --> 33:09.529
j“ go out and find a girl
come on, come on...

33:09.654 --> 33:14.576
Sorry,
but I need this more than you do.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.870
J“ that the days can't be like the nights

33:16.995 --> 33:19.039
j“ in the summer, in the city

33:19.164 --> 33:21.625
j“ in the summer, in the city... j“

33:29.966 --> 33:33.303
You know, you almost broke my neck
with that damn leash tonight.

33:33.428 --> 33:37.349
Well, try harder next time.
"Meet my cousin!" What crap?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.810
My head's killing me already.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.396
Oh, gimme a break.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.988
How come you act like such an ass
when you're drunk?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.908
Basically, I'm a very anal person.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.577
You see, it all stems
from childhood repressions.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.622
Right, that gives you a reason
to screw around?

34:00.747 --> 34:04.668
No. I do that to, uh...
Keep you on your toes.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.714
Hey.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.092
I think you're reallyjealous.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.514
Insufled.

34:19.599 --> 34:23.311
If you're gonna do something like that,
don't do it right in front of me, ok?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.981
Mm, c'mon, you know it doesn't mean
anything to me.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.858
Yeah, well, it made me look like a fool!

34:28.984 --> 34:32.696
Especially in front of someone
like dawn Sorenson.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.658
What do you mean?

34:39.536 --> 34:41.955
I have feelings, too, ok?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.873
C'mon, look...

34:43.999 --> 34:47.752
I was a little drunk
and I felt sorry for her, you know,

34:47.877 --> 34:50.213
being with that creep, bud Remington.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.508
If you're gonna feel sorry for someone,
feel sorry for Mike pryor.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.303
Why should I? The guy's nuts!

34:56.428 --> 34:59.848
- That speech tonight.
- "You're all a bunch of whores."

34:59.973 --> 35:01.933
That only proved it.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.774
Hey, I think I heard something outside.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.610
What?

35:15.822 --> 35:19.034
- Oh!
- Oh, god! I feel so much better!

35:19.159 --> 35:22.078
- You are a gross man!
- Mm, smell that baby!

35:22.203 --> 35:24.748
- That's a winner!
- You're disgusting! What do I see in you?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.751
Who else could give you odorama?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.586
Jerk!

35:31.296 --> 35:33.882
Hey, I think I hear something out there.

35:34.007 --> 35:37.302
- Please, not again.
- No, no. Shh! Really.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.054
Really. Just...

35:41.973 --> 35:43.933
See? I told you.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.145
What do you think it is?

35:48.021 --> 35:51.316
I don't know.
Probablyjust a raccoon or something.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.777
- I'll go outside and...
- Don't go out there.

35:54.444 --> 35:58.323
Hey! You think a raccoon can defeat
your great ratliff?

35:58.448 --> 36:00.492
No way!

36:03.995 --> 36:08.375
Anyway... you don't want them...
To stick that garbage...

36:08.500 --> 36:11.252
All over... your front lawn...

36:12.671 --> 36:14.673
Cos then everyone will find out about us.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.219
- I'll be right back.
- You'd better be.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.487
Be careful.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.106
Miaow!

37:14.441 --> 37:17.277
- Oh, Lynn!
- It's me.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.363
It's me, I'm sorry. Are you ok?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.908
What the hell are you...?

37:24.033 --> 37:26.453
I missed you.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.081
Yeah, you missed me.
I almost got a heart attack out here.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.419
- You ok?
- Ok, the sound's nothing.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.422
- No raccoon. Let's go back in.
- Let's go back in.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.549
Definitely. Right away.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.843
- You almost scared the hell outta me.
- I'm sorry.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.407
Hello. You're Mike pryor, aren't you?

38:46.533 --> 38:47.784
Right.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.495
I hear you caused quite a stir last night.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.997
Well, I really don't think
it's any of your business.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.291
Anything or anybody
that causes a commotion

38:55.416 --> 38:57.669
around this campus is my business.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.798
- It's all bullshit.
- What's the matter with you?

39:01.923 --> 39:05.218
Where do you come off
talking like that, huh?

39:05.343 --> 39:08.429
Why don't you go hand out parking tickets
and leave me alone?

39:08.555 --> 39:12.308
- Stick to something you know about!
- Something I know about?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.143
Listen...

39:14.936 --> 39:19.107
My daughter was about your age.
Then she met a guy like you.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.109
Now she's dead.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.321
Well, I'm sorry,
but that doesn't change the way I feel.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.407
Or anything else.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.596
- They always do.
- Oh, yeah, fast. Very fast.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.390
Shh!

39:53.224 --> 39:54.851
- What?
- Nothing!

39:54.976 --> 39:57.937
Do you remember two years ago
when one of the hidden things

39:58.062 --> 40:00.690
- was coach kimble's jockstrap?
- Oh, yes!

40:00.815 --> 40:04.277
And Sally got caught in his house
trying to find it!

40:04.402 --> 40:08.239
Do you think she was lying
when she said he wanted her to put it on?

40:08.364 --> 40:10.491
If that dirty old man said that to me,

40:10.617 --> 40:13.328
I'd end what's left
of his sex life real quick!

40:15.288 --> 40:17.707
Speaking of sex,
what's Teddy doing tonight?

40:18.541 --> 40:21.794
I don't know. Said something about
going to the hunt with maniac.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.089
- He's been giving me problems lately.
- He doesn't deserve you, Lynn.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.425
You're too nice.
He just takes advantage of it.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.053
- Such are the ways of men!
- Some men.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.180
If I were you, I'd keep an eye on him.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.307
Hey, Teddy's all right.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.018
Just needs a little time to grow up.

40:37.143 --> 40:41.064
There's only one part of Teddy ratliff
that's going to grow,

40:41.189 --> 40:43.191
and we all know what part that is!

40:43.316 --> 40:45.610
Sheila!

40:50.531 --> 40:52.241
Finally!

40:54.202 --> 40:56.037
That burger's naked.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.541
Nutter! Hey, what's with maniac, huh?

41:00.667 --> 41:03.419
Ugh. Leslie dumped on him.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.966
And now she's taken up
with the president of delta fi.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.844
You know, it's not enough
that the school tries to screw you.

41:11.970 --> 41:15.098
Everybody else has to screw around
with everybody else.

41:15.223 --> 41:19.310
Hm, watch out.
You're gonna turn into a cynic!

41:19.435 --> 41:24.399
Maybe. Sometimes I think
Lynn's the only loyal person left.

41:24.524 --> 41:27.902
Ah, I know what you mean, I know.
I see it all the time.

41:28.027 --> 41:32.073
Girls jumping from one bed to another bed,
they drive guys crazy.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.702
Lynn is a really nice girl.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.705
There's not too many of 'em
around anymore.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.957
Thank god for that!

41:41.624 --> 41:44.252
- See ya later, sweetheart!
- Get outta here!

41:51.175 --> 41:54.554
Say, Mac, how do you want to handle
security on the scavenger hunt?

41:54.679 --> 41:56.514
No problem. Take the night off.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.183
I'll prowl the campus myself.
It'll be quiet.

41:59.308 --> 42:01.936
Ok, see you Monday. Thanks.

42:08.401 --> 42:12.321
This is wdbx, the scavenger hunt station
on old gold weekend.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.323
'Now for some more music.

42:14.449 --> 42:18.995

42:46.397 --> 42:49.484
How long are you gonna be studying
for that biology test?

42:49.609 --> 42:51.736
I can't believe you remembered.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.947
- Well, till about 12:30.
- Good time.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.825
- I'll see ya later, then.
- You're crazy!

42:57.950 --> 43:01.788
- You're never gonna get in the dorm.
- Hey, I got in here, didn't I?

43:04.082 --> 43:06.876
- I've gotta go. See you later.
- Wait...

43:07.001 --> 43:09.420
- What are you doing?
- Uh... nothing.

43:20.264 --> 43:24.769
Ok. Stop the walls from moving,
buckle your seatbelts and here we go!

43:24.894 --> 43:26.729
We've hidden 36 items on campus

43:26.854 --> 43:29.482
and I'll give you six clues an hour
until six o'clock.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.652
At 6:30, a representative
from each sorority and fraternity

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
has to be at the station
with all the items they've collected.

Shall we do two?

Let's do two!
Ok. Now wait, be serious.

44:49.896 --> 44:53.107
"A place where vegetables
might be tried."

44:54.483 --> 44:56.736
Get tried?

44:56.861 --> 45:00.072
- Tried in a court?
- Yeah? What?

45:00.823 --> 45:03.409
- No! I don't know!
- It's too difficult.

- I got it! I got it!
- What? What? What? What?

45:07.455 --> 45:10.124
A vegetable court is a squash court.

- 'Not me, man, I haven't seen them.'

45:37.777 --> 45:40.071
I don't know. Maybe I spilled
something from a soda.

45:40.196 --> 45:44.116
I think you're the only noodle on campus
who'd even know what a squash court is.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.244
No! Let's check it out.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.788
I'm sticking with the dining halls.
I'm gonna check them out.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.289
All right.

45:50.414 --> 45:54.126
You go down to the dining halls
and I'm going down to the gym.

- All right. Meet back here?
- Ok. Meet back here.

45:57.088 --> 46:00.132
- 20 minutes?
- 20 minutes.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.969
- Captain, request to synchronize watches.
- Ok.

46:04.053 --> 46:05.763
I don't have a watch.

46:05.888 --> 46:09.100
I think we're sunk before we start.

46:10.476 --> 46:13.396
- Ok, let's go.
- Can you count to 20?

46:13.521 --> 46:16.274
Just count very slowly,
then come back here. I'll see you later.

46:16.399 --> 46:20.069
- That's 20 seconds, not 20 minutes.
- Count slow.

- They don't work.

- Come on, guys.
- I don't wanna go in there.

49:01.522 --> 49:04.024
- I really don't.
- C'mon! It'll be great.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.777
- Shh!
- What is it?

49:06.902 --> 49:11.115
- I thought I heard something.
- Shit! Don't do that!

49:15.536 --> 49:17.347
- That's not funny.
- Yes, it is!

49:17.371 --> 49:19.665
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. C'mon!

Let's just check out the machines
and get out of here.

49:24.170 --> 49:27.131
- I'd rather be in bed personally.
- You would!

49:30.009 --> 49:32.678
That makes sense.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.764
Right!

49:38.809 --> 49:41.270
- Sheila!
- What?

49:47.985 --> 49:51.113
Jane! Where are you?

49:54.700 --> 49:58.996
Hey, we got it.
This has got to be it, a baby carriage.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.832
- What?
- You know "keep your heirs in place".

50:01.957 --> 50:03.918
H-e-i-r-s.

50:04.043 --> 50:07.630
- Heirs!
- Yes! We got one!

50:07.755 --> 50:10.424
I thought he meant "air" like "fresh air".
Jesus!

50:10.549 --> 50:12.510
Hey, get in.

50:13.552 --> 50:16.514
Sure, there's no fresh air
in here anyway!

50:17.306 --> 50:19.558
Come on, let's get out of here.

50:19.683 --> 50:23.646
C'mon, c'mon! Let's get out
of here! I wanna get the next clue.

50:23.771 --> 50:26.357
It isn't getting any less creepy
in here, you know.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.915
Wdbx, kaiser.

50:43.916 --> 50:46.210
Wdbx, what can I do you for?

50:46.835 --> 50:53.008
Dickie is out
and janey is number one.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.056
Nice talking to ya.

51:04.687 --> 51:06.272
Janey?

51:09.149 --> 51:10.776
Janey?

51:24.331 --> 51:26.083
Janey?

51:53.319 --> 51:54.862
Hi, Lynn?

51:54.987 --> 51:58.032
- Listen, is janey at the house?
- No, I thought she was with you.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.034
She was, but then we split up to search

52:00.159 --> 52:02.721
and she told me she'd meet me
in ten minutes and she never showed.

52:02.745 --> 52:05.956
Well, are you in the right place?
Maybe she's looking for you.

52:06.081 --> 52:12.755
Maybe. Listen, if you see her, tell her
to meet me at the house at 1:30, ok?

52:21.972 --> 52:23.307
Janey?

52:23.432 --> 52:26.018
Janey?

52:37.696 --> 52:39.490
Janey?

52:46.413 --> 52:48.499
Janey, are you in there?

53:09.061 --> 53:11.146
Janey?

53:12.856 --> 53:15.526
Janey? Janey? No!

53:26.537 --> 53:28.288
Splendid!

53:41.301 --> 53:44.304
J“ didn't want to have to do it

53:45.723 --> 53:49.351
j“ didn't want to have to break your heart

53:50.352 --> 53:52.438
j“ didn't want to have to do it

53:55.274 --> 53:58.152
J“ I kept a-hoping
from the very start

53:58.277 --> 54:02.698
j” but you kept on a-tryin'

54:02.823 --> 54:06.910
j“ and I knew
that you'd end up a-cryin'

54:07.035 --> 54:11.123
j“ and I knew
I didn't want to have to do it

54:11.665 --> 54:13.709
j“ at all

54:17.546 --> 54:20.507
j“ didn't want to have to do it

54:21.884 --> 54:26.180
j“ didn't want to have to be
the one to say it

54:26.305 --> 54:29.141
j“ didn't want to have to do it

54:31.602 --> 54:36.648
j“ I kept a-hoping there'd be something
to delay it again

54:37.941 --> 54:40.903
j“ yeah, but then

54:42.863 --> 54:49.787
j“ no, I didn't want to have to be
the one to say "the end"

54:54.291 --> 54:57.336
j“ was a time I thought our love could fly

54:57.461 --> 55:00.923
j“ and never, never fall...

55:03.217 --> 55:05.844
Will you please hand me a towel?

55:06.512 --> 55:12.059
J“ to be close to each other at all... j“

55:15.646 --> 55:18.857
um, you don't have to get dressed
on my account.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.653
You take a lot for granted.

55:22.778 --> 55:26.949
You know if I were to scream,
you would be in a lot of trouble.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.743
You wouldn't do that.

55:29.868 --> 55:34.206
- I'm hardly worth a scream.
- What do you think you're doing here?

55:34.331 --> 55:37.000
Well, I didn't want to stand you up
on our first date.

55:37.125 --> 55:41.296
Oh, our first date. I almost forgot.

55:44.132 --> 55:46.426
So, how's our baseball hero tonight?

55:46.552 --> 55:49.638
Basketball, and who said I was a hero?

55:49.763 --> 55:54.601
As I recall, you did.
At the party?

55:55.435 --> 55:59.940
Oh. Well, we gonna spend the rest
of the evening in the bathroom?

56:07.322 --> 56:10.951
- It's a really nice place you have here.
- Thank you.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.709
Um... mayl...

56:20.002 --> 56:22.087
Offer you a drink?

56:23.088 --> 56:26.216
Sure, but may I offer you some wine?

56:27.009 --> 56:29.303
Uh... sure.

56:29.428 --> 56:33.599
Yeah,
wine is great for those special occasions.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.063
To a wonderful evening.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.817
Now, that remains to be seen, doesn't it?

56:45.068 --> 56:48.322
Listen up, I've had a couple of calls
complaining the clues are too hard.

56:48.447 --> 56:51.742
Sorry, but it wouldn't be any fun
if the clues are easy.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.328
Remember, a new clue coming up soon.

56:54.453 --> 56:57.414
In the meantime, let's warm up this place

56:57.539 --> 57:01.043
with "summer in the city"
by the lovin' spoonful.

57:05.047 --> 57:09.426
- Wdbx, kaiser here.
- 'Kathy's number two.

57:10.469 --> 57:13.221
'Who'll be number three?'

57:13.347 --> 57:17.643
j“ been down, isn't it a pity,
doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city...

57:17.768 --> 57:21.730
This is the kaiser speaking.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.900
Ready for the next hunt clue?

57:25.025 --> 57:29.863
Kaiser, kaiser.
I want it. I want it. I want it.

57:29.988 --> 57:32.074
I need it, I need it, I need it.

57:32.199 --> 57:38.413
Ok, this priceless item
is long and it's soft

57:38.538 --> 57:41.166
and longer when it's hard.

57:41.291 --> 57:44.461
My god! That's what I want.
That's what I want.

57:45.087 --> 57:49.383
All right! Keep tight!
Who knows what you'll sight?

57:49.508 --> 57:52.386
It's now time for clue number eight
and here it is.

57:52.511 --> 57:54.179
"I'm on a beach and I'm a groovy king.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.265
"'Find the right fork
and you can make me sing.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.811
Is there a beach around here anywhere?

58:02.688 --> 58:04.272
I can't think of any.

58:04.398 --> 58:09.444
The only place I can think of is Swanson's
pond, if you call that place a beach.

58:09.569 --> 58:12.322
Um... I don't think
that's what he had in mind.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.700
I don't know, then.
I'll check it out anyway.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.660
I'll check out the lodge
while I'm there, too.

58:20.664 --> 58:22.082
Security, macvey.

58:22.207 --> 58:26.420
- Hi, this is Charlie kaiser over at wdbx.
- 'Yeah?'

58:26.545 --> 58:29.881
this may be nothing, but I'm getting some
really strange calls here at the station.

58:30.007 --> 58:31.466
What do you mean strange?

58:31.591 --> 58:34.886
Somebody's been calling up and
saying some pretty off-the-wall things.

58:35.012 --> 58:37.889
- Man or woman?
- That's part of it. I can't tell.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.850
Is it some kind ofjoke?

58:39.975 --> 58:42.602
- You know what it means?
- 'No idea. It's probably nothing.'

58:42.728 --> 58:45.272
but you know, there's something
really creepy about it.

58:45.397 --> 58:48.692
You did right to call.
If you figure out what it means

58:48.817 --> 58:52.738
or if you're getting more calls like that,
get me here quick.

58:52.863 --> 58:56.491
- 'You think something's wrong?'
- Oh, I'm sure it's just some crank.

58:56.616 --> 58:59.077
You seem to bring 'em out, kaiser.
No insult meant.

58:59.202 --> 59:02.497
None taken, Mac.
I know my following.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.850
Benson! I underestimated you.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.436
Could this be love?

59:24.561 --> 59:27.939
Well, if you want me,
you'll have to come and get me.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.944
Come on!

59:35.405 --> 59:37.491
You must be getting hungry now,
Benson.

59:54.508 --> 59:56.718
Oh, Benson, Benson bear.

59:57.928 --> 1:00:01.306
The body that won't stop!
He's even got a mind.

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:07.813
Come and get it, Benson.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:14.361
I'm waiting for you, Benson.

1:00:16.113 --> 1:00:19.116
Oh, come on, Benson.
I know you're faster than that.

1:00:21.034 --> 1:00:23.411
Oh, my god! Benson!

1:00:23.537 --> 1:00:27.249
- Benson!
- Bitch! Bitch!

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:31.253
You whore!

1:00:40.804 --> 1:00:44.516
Dawn, you're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:49.062
I just hope that you like me
a little bit, that's all.

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:53.275
I like you a lot.

1:00:54.359 --> 1:00:56.903
You wouldn't be here if I didn't.

1:01:21.845 --> 1:01:23.805
Security, macvey.

1:01:23.930 --> 1:01:27.309
'Patty macvey
wasn't a nice girl.

1:01:27.434 --> 1:01:30.145
'Now Patty macvey is dead.'

1:01:30.812 --> 1:01:32.898
who the hell is this?

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:37.944
- 'Dickie Cavanaugh.'
- Dickie Cavanaugh, you bastard!

1:01:38.069 --> 1:01:41.615
- You're locked away.
- 'Am I, macvey?

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:44.701
'Am I?'

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:05.430
- 'Weston hill sanitarium.'
- Macvey, DeWitt campus security.

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:08.558
- Get me Jack Quinn fast.
- 'I don't know if he's here.'

1:02:08.683 --> 1:02:10.352
well find out, damn it.

1:02:10.477 --> 1:02:12.771
Oh, god!

1:02:12.896 --> 1:02:15.941
- Come on!
- I'm not seriously up for this.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:19.444
Come on, it's gonna be great.
You're gonna love this.

1:02:28.036 --> 1:02:30.121
- Hey, Trish.
- What?

1:02:31.206 --> 1:02:34.417
I hear the ghost of James durham!

1:02:34.542 --> 1:02:37.295
Will you knock it off?

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:42.592
- Oh, if my dad could see me now.
- Yeah, fabulous!

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:48.473
Leslie, right there. You see right there?

1:02:48.598 --> 1:02:51.184
I don't know, can you make out what it is?

1:02:51.309 --> 1:02:56.398
No, it's too high. Wish you hadn't dumped
maniac, we could use him right now.

1:02:56.523 --> 1:02:59.776
Oh, come on, Trish, I don't want
to talk about Pete. It still hurts.

1:03:00.944 --> 1:03:03.405
Ok. Come on, let's go, shrimp.
I'll give you a boost.

1:03:03.530 --> 1:03:05.782
Why me? I always have to do this stuff?

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:08.451
Because you're wearing sneakers
and I'm wearing boots.

1:03:08.576 --> 1:03:11.037
- And you just had a manicure!
- Shut up! Get up there!

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:13.039
One, two...

1:03:15.083 --> 1:03:20.213
- What is it?
- A record. Carole king "tapestry" album.

1:03:20.839 --> 1:03:25.510
- Hey, this has got to be it.
- Sure! "A groovy king on a beach."

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:27.971
- A beech tree?
- Oh, right.

1:03:28.096 --> 1:03:29.681
Did you hear that?

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:31.951
- No, I didn't hear anything.
- Leslie, I swear I heard...

1:03:31.975 --> 1:03:36.813
Trish, come on. There's nobody here.
Come down and let's get the next clue.

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:38.523
- All right.
- Got it?

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:42.944
Come on, let's see what kaiser's
got to say. We're on a roll now.

1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:46.031
So, here's clue 14.

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:48.950
"I keep things hot. I keep things cold.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:52.829
"I'm hiding where a bat might be bowled."
That's it.

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:56.458
"Keep things hot, keep things cold.
I'm hiding where a bat might be bowled."

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:59.085
- That's clever.
- Where a bat might be bowled?

1:03:59.210 --> 1:04:01.087
At a baseball game.

1:04:01.212 --> 1:04:04.132
- In a baseball field?
- No, isn't that too easy?

1:04:04.257 --> 1:04:10.055
I guess so. Oh, god! You don't think
it's the kind of bat that flies, do you?

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:15.268
That's what I was thinking,
but where would you find a "bold" bat?

1:04:15.393 --> 1:04:20.482
I got it! In a belfry!
You know, bats in a belfry.

1:04:21.066 --> 1:04:23.586
Well, that's terrific, Trish,
but there's no belfry around here.

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:26.738
- Can you think of anything else?
- In the chapel.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.866
I mean, there's not a belfry
but there is an attic, that's pretty close.

1:04:29.991 --> 1:04:32.702
- You think that's it?
- God, I don't know!

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:36.081
I'll tell you what, I'll go check
the chapel, you check the baseball field.

1:04:36.206 --> 1:04:38.225
- I'll meet you back here in half an hour.
- All right.

1:04:38.249 --> 1:04:40.126
- Take the album.
- Make it half an hour.

1:04:40.251 --> 1:04:42.629
- It's getting scary out here.
- Will you relax?

1:04:42.754 --> 1:04:44.756
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

1:04:46.508 --> 1:04:48.843
What the hell is wrong
with you guys over there?

1:04:48.968 --> 1:04:51.429
You running some kind of a country club?

1:04:51.554 --> 1:04:53.515
'Hey, Mac, cool down.
What's the trouble?'

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.518
the trouble is, Quinn,
that one of your precious nutsos,

1:04:56.643 --> 1:04:59.771
Dickie Cavanaugh to be exact,
just called me on the telephone.

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:04.067
- Don't you lock your people up at night?
- 'You said Dickie Cavanaugh?

1:05:04.192 --> 1:05:06.152
- 'Are you sure?'
- Sure, I'm sure.

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:10.448
If you can't keep that bastard under lock
and key, I'll come over and do it myself.

1:05:10.573 --> 1:05:15.161
'Hold on, Mac. Dickie Cavanaugh
checked out of here two days ago.

1:05:15.286 --> 1:05:18.915
- 'Couldn't have been him.'
- What do you mean checked out? How?

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.753
'Mac, Dickie Cavanaugh killed himself.
He hung himself in his cell.'

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.381
hung himself?

1:05:27.632 --> 1:05:29.968
- You sure?
- 'Are you kidding?

1:05:30.093 --> 1:05:32.137
'I cut him down myself.'

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:36.391
- are you sure he's dead?
- 'Christ, I hope so!

1:05:36.516 --> 1:05:40.937
'His sister picked up the body to Bury it
two days ago. I turned it over to her.

1:05:41.062 --> 1:05:43.148
'He was sure dead then.'

1:05:45.066 --> 1:05:46.401
yeah.

1:05:47.402 --> 1:05:52.073
Well, I'm sorry for bothering you.
Must have got the name wrong.

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:57.412
- Get back to sleep, Jack.
- 'You sure there's nothing I can do?'

1:05:57.537 --> 1:05:59.998
no, nothing. I'll sort this out myself.

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:02.584
I'll talk to you later.

1:06:16.806 --> 1:06:19.350
Huh! "Where a bat might be bold"!

1:08:46.372 --> 1:08:49.626
Hey, Benson, are you nuts?
You scared me half to death.

1:08:49.751 --> 1:08:52.086
Hello, Leslie.

1:08:52.211 --> 1:08:55.715
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

1:09:01.095 --> 1:09:03.556
Come on, Benson, a joke's a joke.

1:09:04.766 --> 1:09:09.312
Don't be afraid, Leslie.

1:09:10.313 --> 1:09:12.065
Hey, Benson.

1:09:18.237 --> 1:09:19.864
Benson!

1:09:39.258 --> 1:09:41.761
Hey, what the hell time is it?

1:09:45.431 --> 1:09:48.017
Three.

1:09:48.726 --> 1:09:52.647
- Oh, Jesus, I've gotta get out of here.
- You have another appointment?

1:09:52.772 --> 1:09:54.857
No, but I have to go.

1:10:00.405 --> 1:10:03.449
I gather this means
you're not staying for breakfast.

1:10:03.574 --> 1:10:05.493
Never eat it.

1:10:05.618 --> 1:10:10.790
Besides, I really don't think
it would be a good idea for either of us.

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:19.716
I've really had a terrific time.

1:10:21.384 --> 1:10:23.469
It was wonderful, I mean.

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:28.182
- I mean...
- You mean you had a terrific time.

1:10:28.307 --> 1:10:31.686
But now guilt is setting in
and you want to get out of here.

1:10:32.979 --> 1:10:37.316
- You're right.
- Don't worry about it, Teddy. It's ok.

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:41.070
I'd really like to see you again.

1:10:42.864 --> 1:10:44.949
I mean, we could be friends.

1:10:46.826 --> 1:10:53.958
All four of us? I mean, your Lynn, my bud.
It's not gonna work.

1:10:56.335 --> 1:10:58.671
Don't worry about it.

1:11:00.423 --> 1:11:04.051
You know, you're...
You're really some girl.

1:11:05.303 --> 1:11:08.181
"Some woman" is the way I'd put it!

1:11:08.306 --> 1:11:11.392
Now, get out of here. Go on!
Go on.

1:11:12.393 --> 1:11:14.645
- Get out of here... champ.
- Ok.

1:11:16.439 --> 1:11:19.817
- And lock the door behind you, would you?
- All right.

1:11:32.413 --> 1:11:36.250
Jesus! Hey, Benson. Where's Sheila?

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:39.879
What's the matter? She dumped you
for somebody else already?

1:11:51.516 --> 1:11:54.560
Wdbx all night, Charlie kaiser.

1:11:58.105 --> 1:12:04.153
'The twins are together again.'

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:28.803
Wow!

1:12:48.573 --> 1:12:51.200
- 'She's dead! The blood!'
- What?

1:12:51.325 --> 1:12:54.579
'She's dead! The blood! It's awful!'

1:12:54.704 --> 1:12:58.082
- who is this?
- 'Lynn! It's Lynn. Oh, my god!'

1:12:58.207 --> 1:13:01.752
- Lynn, I can't understand.
- 'Oh, my god.

1:13:02.712 --> 1:13:07.258
- 'She's dead. Leslie's dead.'
- Lynn, stay right where you are.

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:09.969
'Oh, god!'

1:13:15.099 --> 1:13:17.977
- 'Wdbx, kaiser.'
- Charlie, this is Mac.

1:13:18.102 --> 1:13:20.771
- 'Hey, Mac. Troubles?'
- Just listen.

1:13:20.897 --> 1:13:24.442
I want you to get on right now and
announce that the scavenger hunt is over.

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:27.737
- 'Over? What's happening?'
- I'll explain later.

1:13:27.862 --> 1:13:32.158
Just get on now and tell everyone
to go inside and get back to their rooms.

1:13:32.283 --> 1:13:36.203
Try not to panic anyone,
but get them back to their rooms.

1:13:36.329 --> 1:13:39.165
- 'But, Mac...'
- Now, Charlie. Do it now.

1:13:45.338 --> 1:13:47.423
Sorry, folks, but the scavenger hunt
is over.

1:13:47.548 --> 1:13:50.343
'Please go back to your rooms.

1:13:50.468 --> 1:13:53.137
'Please, everyone,
go back to your rooms.'

1:14:03.105 --> 1:14:04.607
This is insanity!

1:14:04.732 --> 1:14:07.210
Detective greenspan, nothing like this
ever happened here before.

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:10.863
I think if we just remain calm
and keep everybody in hand,

1:14:10.988 --> 1:14:12.615
we'll get to the bottom of this.

1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:15.576
Meanwhile, those reporters
will have to be told something.

1:14:15.701 --> 1:14:17.036
God, the publicity!

1:14:17.161 --> 1:14:20.039
- What will the trustees say?
- Can't be helped, Dean kemper.

1:14:20.164 --> 1:14:23.584
Why don't you issue some kind of statement
about a continuing investigation?

1:14:23.709 --> 1:14:26.754
Tell them you'll have a press conference
soon as you get some news.

1:14:26.879 --> 1:14:29.507
Would you handle that, Mac?
I just can't deal with all this.

1:14:29.632 --> 1:14:32.259
Yes, sir.
Let's get away from these people.

1:14:35.054 --> 1:14:38.516
- Leslie was senator Peterson's daughter?
- Yes, everybody knows that.

1:14:38.641 --> 1:14:41.203
I had to make sure, but do you think
the murder had anything to do

1:14:41.227 --> 1:14:43.604
- with his political affiliation?
- No, that's ridiculous.

1:14:43.729 --> 1:14:47.274
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Robert, take me home!

1:15:28.232 --> 1:15:31.527
Come on. Look, look,
you don't have to get your hands...

1:15:31.652 --> 1:15:34.822
- What happened?
- I just want to get my car.

1:15:34.947 --> 1:15:39.744
Yeah, yeah. Listen, get a couple more guys
up here for crowd control, huh?

1:15:39.869 --> 1:15:42.538
It's completely out of control here.
Yeah, put him on.

1:15:45.332 --> 1:15:46.834
What?

1:15:46.959 --> 1:15:48.252
Oh, no.

1:15:49.879 --> 1:15:51.672
I'll tell him. Hey, listen.

1:15:51.797 --> 1:15:54.884
If anything else comes up,
get back to me, and get back to me quick.

1:16:02.475 --> 1:16:04.769
They just found another one
down by the pond.

1:16:06.979 --> 1:16:09.523
- Same as the other?
- I'm afraid so.

1:16:09.648 --> 1:16:12.443
Oh, Christ! What a mess!

1:16:13.027 --> 1:16:15.362
We're going to have to restrict
everyone to campus.

1:16:15.488 --> 1:16:17.156
What about the parents?
They're calling.

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:19.700
- They want to take their children home.
- No one leaves.

1:16:19.825 --> 1:16:21.952
You'll never be able to quarantine
this whole place.

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:24.538
Everybody knows what's going on.
There's too much movement.

1:16:24.663 --> 1:16:26.624
The campus is too spread out.

1:16:26.749 --> 1:16:29.460
Look, just question the people
that you feel are important.

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.462
Let the rest of them go,
if they want to.

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:33.631
Ok, I'll buy that.

1:16:34.215 --> 1:16:36.217
We'll need a couple of rooms
for questioning.

1:16:36.342 --> 1:16:39.386
You can use my office
at the administration building.

1:16:39.512 --> 1:16:43.808
- Mac, see what you can do down there?
- Yes, sir. I'll talk to you later.

1:16:43.933 --> 1:16:46.018
Right this way, gentlemen.

1:16:50.439 --> 1:16:55.027
Mac's told us it was you who had
discovered Leslie Peterson's body.

1:16:55.528 --> 1:16:59.949
I heard a clue that I thought
I knew the answer to,

1:17:00.074 --> 1:17:03.911
so I asked my girlfriend Claudia
to cover for me.

1:17:04.787 --> 1:17:07.164
And so I went to the chapel.

1:17:08.457 --> 1:17:11.794
'When I got
to the top of the stairs...'

1:17:14.046 --> 1:17:16.757
Oh, god!

1:17:16.882 --> 1:17:19.468
I mean, there she was and...

1:17:19.593 --> 1:17:22.555
Is there anything else
that you can think of?

1:17:23.722 --> 1:17:27.226
Something you might have seen
or something you've heard?

1:17:27.893 --> 1:17:32.690
I saw Benson in his costume
before I walked into the chapel.

1:17:32.815 --> 1:17:36.861
- Who's Benson? What costume?
- Michael Benson.

1:17:36.986 --> 1:17:39.196
He's our team mascot.

1:17:40.865 --> 1:17:43.993
Our mascot's a bear,
so he was wearing a bear costume.

1:17:44.118 --> 1:17:46.829
What kind of guy is this Michael Benson?

1:17:46.954 --> 1:17:48.706
He's a nice guy.

1:17:50.166 --> 1:17:52.418
No, he wouldn't do anything like this.

1:17:52.543 --> 1:17:56.463
You're probably right,
but we will have to question him anyway.

1:17:56.589 --> 1:18:00.050
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in Laurel hall.

1:18:00.176 --> 1:18:04.805
I don't know the room number, but you
could look it up in the campus directory.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:08.517
Thank you, miss Connors. You may go.

1:18:09.059 --> 1:18:12.980
Thank you.
I hope you find this lunatic soon.

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:15.983
We will. You be careful.

1:18:16.734 --> 1:18:18.736
Thank you, I will.

1:18:20.404 --> 1:18:23.199
- Charlie, this is Mac.
- 'Yeah?'

1:18:23.324 --> 1:18:26.118
uh... just a couple of questions,

1:18:26.243 --> 1:18:28.954
and I want to keep this
between you and me.

1:18:30.581 --> 1:18:35.377
Those calls, the strange ones
that you got last night, the voice?

1:18:35.502 --> 1:18:37.522
'I told you, Mac,
I couldn't tell anything about it.

1:18:37.546 --> 1:18:39.546
'It was a really strange sound.
Sort of a whisper.'

1:18:39.632 --> 1:18:44.678
I know, but can you remember
anything special about the whisper?

1:18:44.803 --> 1:18:48.098
- Anything?
- 'Besides being weird, nothing.

1:18:48.224 --> 1:18:51.560
'But I've got it on the delay tape,
if you want to hear it for yourself.'

1:18:54.396 --> 1:18:57.024
you're telling me
you got the whole thing on tape?

1:18:57.149 --> 1:18:59.735
'We always use a delay tape
on a request line.'

1:19:01.779 --> 1:19:05.741
Charlie, will you get those tapes
to me right away?

1:19:05.866 --> 1:19:07.743
'Sure, thing, Mac.'

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:18.087
- Where were you last night?
- I don't know. I was out.

1:19:18.212 --> 1:19:21.840
We already know that so tell us,
who were you with?

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.218
All right. I went downtown.

1:19:25.886 --> 1:19:29.682
And I picked up one of those women
on chapel street.

1:19:31.684 --> 1:19:35.437
- And I took her to the midtown motel.
- What name did you register under?

1:19:36.855 --> 1:19:38.274
John clary.

1:19:38.399 --> 1:19:40.359
Do you have a girlfriend?

1:19:40.901 --> 1:19:43.279
- Nope.
- Why are you lying?

1:19:43.404 --> 1:19:45.364
We know Leslie Peterson
was your girlfriend.

1:19:45.990 --> 1:19:48.659
Leslie Peterson dropped me.

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:50.869
Is that what bothered you,
that she left you?

1:19:50.995 --> 1:19:53.247
Sure it bothered me.

1:19:54.707 --> 1:19:56.792
Wouldn't it bother you?

1:19:59.253 --> 1:20:01.338
I know what y'all are thinking.

1:20:02.715 --> 1:20:05.926
You're thinking that she quit on me
and I killed her.

1:20:07.386 --> 1:20:09.972
Jesus Christ, I'm not crazy!

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:15.144
You said Mike pryor and Sheila Robinson
had an argument at the party.

1:20:15.269 --> 1:20:21.525
- Yeah, yeah, she hit him.
- Do you have any idea what this was over?

1:20:21.650 --> 1:20:25.404
Well, I think Sheila and Benson
were fooling around

1:20:25.529 --> 1:20:27.614
and pryor found out about it.

1:20:28.490 --> 1:20:30.784
You see, I overheard something pryor said.

1:20:30.909 --> 1:20:32.453
He said...

1:20:32.578 --> 1:20:35.539
"'That creep's not gonna take you
away from me."

1:20:35.664 --> 1:20:39.418
'And then Sheila said to him,
"you don't own me."

1:20:40.836 --> 1:20:43.964
'Then he grabbed her,
ripped her dress.

1:20:45.132 --> 1:20:46.925
'That's when she hit him.

1:20:47.051 --> 1:20:51.138
'And then he just started hollering
at the top of his lungs.'

1:20:52.556 --> 1:20:57.561
he called all the girls whores,
and he just stormed out.

1:20:58.437 --> 1:21:02.358
And why do you think
this has anything to do with Benson?

1:21:03.025 --> 1:21:06.737
Well, I'll tell you, because right after
that, Benson went over to Sheila.

1:21:07.363 --> 1:21:09.990
'And Sheila put her arms around him.

1:21:11.075 --> 1:21:14.119
'And Benson started smooching her.'

1:21:14.953 --> 1:21:19.708
oh, well, Trisha saw it, too.
You know, lots of people saw it and, uh...

1:21:21.001 --> 1:21:25.589
Oh, earlier at the party, you wanna know?
I overheard something Benson said.

1:21:25.714 --> 1:21:29.885
He said, "when are you gonna tell him?"
Talking about pryor.

1:21:30.010 --> 1:21:33.180
And Sheila said,
"I wanna break it to him easy."

1:21:37.601 --> 1:21:40.521
But what's all this got to do
with the murders, anyway?

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:48.570
Oh, my god! I hope you don't think
pryor had anything to do with this.

1:21:48.695 --> 1:21:50.697
You were dating her, weren't you?

1:21:50.823 --> 1:21:54.159
Dating her? I was in love with her.

1:21:54.284 --> 1:21:56.703
We went out together for over two years!

1:21:56.829 --> 1:22:00.666
- Then she dumped me for some ass!
- What was his name?

1:22:00.791 --> 1:22:02.960
What difference does it make
what his name is now?

1:22:03.085 --> 1:22:05.254
But it does matter. What was his name?

1:22:05.379 --> 1:22:08.132
Benson, Michael Benson.

1:22:08.257 --> 1:22:11.510
- Why did she break up with you?
- I don't know.

1:22:11.635 --> 1:22:14.721
Come on, you went out with her
for over two years

1:22:14.847 --> 1:22:16.390
and you don't know why she dumped you?

1:22:16.515 --> 1:22:20.769
No, I don't know.
I guess I wasn't good enough for her.

1:22:23.188 --> 1:22:26.442
You guys don't think
I had anything to do with this, do you?

1:22:31.530 --> 1:22:32.948
Hello?

1:22:33.866 --> 1:22:35.701
Yeah. Thanks, Tom.

1:22:37.953 --> 1:22:40.289
Pryor, wait outside.

1:22:41.248 --> 1:22:44.543
Do we have something to eat?

1:22:45.294 --> 1:22:48.046
No. All I got is peanut butter.

1:22:48.839 --> 1:22:50.591
But no jelly.

1:22:53.177 --> 1:22:54.761
If you eat it...

1:22:56.138 --> 1:22:58.557
You'll never get your mouth
open again.

1:22:59.808 --> 1:23:02.519
- Can't we get anything else?
- Not unless we go out.

1:23:02.644 --> 1:23:04.771
We can't do that.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.944
You, uh... wanna fool around?

1:23:11.069 --> 1:23:13.155
I've been listening to this.

1:23:15.741 --> 1:23:19.411
Oh, come on. I really don't feel like it.

1:23:44.478 --> 1:23:47.314
- What you do that for you?
- Did you feel like it last night?

1:23:48.732 --> 1:23:53.654
- What?
- I said did you feel like it last night?

1:23:55.239 --> 1:23:57.991
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about last night.

1:23:58.116 --> 1:24:01.954
- Did you feel like fooling around then?
- No, I didn't. I was studying.

1:24:02.746 --> 1:24:07.751
- That's all you were doing?
- What are you trying to say?

1:24:07.876 --> 1:24:10.629
I'm not trying to say anything,
just asking you a question.
