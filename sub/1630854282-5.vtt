WEBVTT

00:27.695 --> 00:30.498
McDowd!
We've got you surrounded!

00:30.598 --> 00:32.166
Come on out
and we won't hurt you!

00:32.266 --> 00:34.968
All right, Santiago.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.537
I'm coming out right now.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.905
Get! Get! Get!

01:18.746 --> 01:20.881
We're coming for you, McDowd!

01:20.981 --> 01:23.151
You're running
out of places to hide!

01:34.162 --> 01:36.230
Hey, can you hand me the gin?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.331
The brown one, right?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.432
- Abby.
- I'm kidding.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.534
More of a Scotch gal myself.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.470
Aren't you a delight?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.037
So, how's it going?

01:44.172 --> 01:46.174
What with
the new management and all.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.976
Well...

01:50.077 --> 01:51.545
It's the strangest thing,
you know.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.414
Can we turn those beds, please?

01:53.514 --> 01:54.815
We're in a hotel here, folks.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.186
Ever since Tom took over,
I have just gotten

01:58.286 --> 02:00.188
so damn clumsy.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.289
Kate...

02:04.392 --> 02:06.927
Next one comes
out of your paycheck.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.629
Abby, I'm heading home
to clean up.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.764
See you
at the jailhouse later.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.803
So, my meeting with Ethan's
in a couple of days.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.538
We have a lot of work
to do before then.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.573
Grand.
Where do we start?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.875
Well, uh, Liam.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.044
I read his file,
I saw that he departed

02:24.212 --> 02:26.480
from the Boston police
pretty abruptly.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.949
We should also probably talk
about your family,

02:29.049 --> 02:30.518
who they are, why you're
estranged from them.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.819
That kind of thing.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.454
I don't see why
any of that matters.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.822
Tom murdered Liam.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.357
Shouldn't we just focus
on the murderer?

02:36.457 --> 02:39.260
Of course, right, but we need
an airtight case,

02:39.360 --> 02:40.894
and when this kind
of thing happens

02:40.994 --> 02:42.630
the Pinkertons often
focus on the victim

02:42.730 --> 02:44.232
as much as they focus
on the criminal.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.034
So if we want their help,
which I'm assuming that we do,

02:47.134 --> 02:49.870
you may have to be ready
to answer some tough questions.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.739
I've already told you
everything there is to tell.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.443
Right, Abby, y-you know
I'm-I'm, I'm trying to help.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.544
I...

02:56.644 --> 02:57.778
There's nothing more to say.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.858
Whoa.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.893
What the hell?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.662
Damn it, Eli.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.097
Come here.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.167
It's damn good--
damn good to see you.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.103
Yeah, I heard you were
out this way.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.938
I thought I'd come see it
for myself, huh?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.309
<i>He might have been aiming
for you. He punched me</i>

04:01.309 --> 04:02.810
square in the teeth, come on.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.845
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you took
a lot of punches for me,

04:04.945 --> 04:07.648
but a lot more
were meant for you.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.185
How's Texarkana?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.355
You still running
the old schemes?

04:14.455 --> 04:15.989
Nah.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.359
Nah, stealing cattle in East
Texas ain't what it used to be.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.328
Half the money,
twice the chance

04:20.328 --> 04:21.829
of getting your head blown off.

04:22.563 --> 04:26.233
Yeah, plus, without you there
as sheriff to cover my tracks,

04:26.334 --> 04:30.137
it was, uh, only a matter
of time before I got caught.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.672
What about
this little visit?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.207
You in trouble?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.945
Can't an old friend
just drop by?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.417
<i>What brings you in to town?</i>

04:43.517 --> 04:46.487
I came here
to check on your wound.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.121
Thank you for everything.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.658
You take better care
of me than I do myself.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.762
Well, you're healing well.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.096
It'll leave a scar, though.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.531
That's all right.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.533
I sort of take pride
in them now.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.403
It's good
to see you find your strength.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.041
Calian, is something wrong?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.846
I might not always be around
here for you, that's all.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.484
Hey, come on.

05:23.223 --> 05:27.194
It's Gus.
Any idea what that's about?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.730
No.

05:31.098 --> 05:35.803
I've been so busy
with you and Hoyt and Lucia...

05:35.903 --> 05:39.139
I've failed to be there
for Augustus and my people.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.442
- Calian, that's my fault.
- No. It's mine.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.512
And as long as I've known
Augustus, we've been outsiders.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.848
But lately the way
he trusts the sheriff...

05:48.649 --> 05:50.984
...it's hard to know if we're
still on the same side.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.822
I suppose if we can no longer
trust our friends...

05:54.922 --> 05:56.424
who can we trust?

05:58.992 --> 06:01.161
You remember Sadie?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.431
Of course.
I knew her before you did.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.233
Well, she married
a dentist from Ohio.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.835
A dentist?

06:07.935 --> 06:10.037
Not how I pictured
her living out her days.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.672
No kidding.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.775
We always said we were gonna
name that cantina after her.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.877
What cantina?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.479
- You don't remember?
- No.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.947
We were gonna take
the cattle rustling money

06:20.047 --> 06:22.916
and open a little cantina
south of the border.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.520
Sadie's Cantina.
That's right.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.355
I can't believe
I forgot about that.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.791
You and I were gonna
get fat and old,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.760
and she was
gonna tend the bar.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.328
Well, here's to...

06:37.264 --> 06:38.832
Sadie and her dentist.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.170
We could still do it.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.606
Do what?

06:45.706 --> 06:48.008
Open the cantina. I got
a little bit of money left.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.477
Maybe not enough,

06:49.477 --> 06:51.044
but you and me
riding together again?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.546
- Eli, hang on...
- We could...

06:52.646 --> 06:53.947
- No, no, just think about it.
- Hang on a minute.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.583
I got my hands full
here in Independence.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.850
You name me one thing
the two of us ever put

06:56.950 --> 06:58.619
our minds to
we couldn't pull off.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.554
I can't up and go
to Mexico on a whim.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.823
Why not?
Tell me, why not?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.759
Hey, all that money
we made stealing cattle?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.361
I never told anyone
that was your idea.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.234
I'm just asking you
to do me a favor, Tom, okay?

07:14.334 --> 07:16.704
Why are you really here, Eli?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.271
- I told you I'm going
to California.
- No. The real reason.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.640
First you come out here
out of the blue,

07:19.740 --> 07:20.708
and now you're selling me
on an old daydream

07:20.808 --> 07:22.275
like your life depends on it.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.644
- Why are you really here?
- Because, damn it,

07:23.744 --> 07:25.779
I won't make it out there
without your help.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.951
And I'm really tired
of running, Tom.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.754
Eli, who are you running from?

07:54.441 --> 07:55.543
Morning, Sheriff.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.144
Morning, Gus.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.548
New batch of warrants
just arrived earlier today.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.718
Yeah, I'm headed in soon.
Can we discuss it then?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.921
Actually, uh,
afraid one can't wait.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.758
Eli McDowd.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.561
Yeah, somebody in town thought
they spotted him earlier today.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.630
McDowd's wanted for cattle
theft, fraud, and murder.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.566
There's a huge bounty
on this guy's head.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.568
Right, yeah.
Appreciate you telling me.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.836
Yeah, and one more thing.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.675
If Eli McDowd is in the area,
he won't be for long.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.577
Gil Santiago is after him.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.645
You heard of him, right?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.314
Only rumors.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.150
Yeah, he respects the bounty
more than the badge.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.086
He will get in our way
if we don't move fast.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.089
So I figured that I'd take
a ride off and take a look.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.423
No.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.960
I'd like you to wait for me,

08:47.060 --> 08:52.032
and, uh, your friend
the Apache tracker...

08:52.132 --> 08:53.466
- Calian.
- Yeah.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.804
Both of you, go to the ridge
overlooking the town

08:56.904 --> 08:58.872
and do not do anything
until I get there.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.708
You got it?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.634
Where the hell'd you go, Eli?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.508
Morning, y'all.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.410
Hoyt, it's practically noon.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.846
Which begs the question,

09:38.946 --> 09:40.480
where do you sleep anyway?

09:40.648 --> 09:42.549
You know, here and there.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.818
Oh, I want to guess this one.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
All right, it's Wednesday,
and they muck out

09:47.020 --> 09:48.321
the stables on Wednesdays.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.322
So you didn't sleep there.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.124
I'm gonna say...

09:52.225 --> 09:54.027
...that you bunked
at the undertaker's again.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.634
I appreciate the quiet.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.202
- Do you?
- I do.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.336
I'm sure.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.538
Calian.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.674
Augustus.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.341
Been looking for you.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.143
The sheriff wants your help.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.479
We're tracking down
an outlaw-- Eli McDowd.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.247
Of course.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.248
What do you know about him?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.754
I'll be out on the ridge
when you're ready.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.968
There's something
very wrong about this picture.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.070
- And what is that?
- I'm the only person

10:37.170 --> 10:39.106
who doesn't work
for Tom Davidson.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.374
The rest of y'all are
at his damn beck and call.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.542
Oh, please.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.944
You run this place for him.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.146
Abby's his clerk.
Calian's his tracker.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.514
But me?

10:47.614 --> 10:50.650
I'm beholden to no man.
A genuine renegade.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.320
- Hmm, you're a genuine something.
- I'll prove it to you.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.622
Tom and Gus
are riding out of town, right?

10:55.723 --> 10:58.591
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I'm gonna break

10:58.692 --> 11:00.728
into Tom's place,
see what I can find.

11:00.728 --> 11:04.898
Whatever I dig up, you can take
to that Pinkerton boss of yours.

11:09.737 --> 11:10.804
What?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.540
Hoyt, you aren't
exactly stealthy.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.142
What is that supposed to mean?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.576
She means
you're about as subtle

11:16.744 --> 11:18.611
as a bag of hammers, gorgeous.

11:18.746 --> 11:22.415
Given your luck, you'd get
caught and hanged by sundown.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.852
Wow. Okay.

11:25.753 --> 11:30.523
Well, fine, I won't linger
where I'm not appreciated.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.760
Well, if it's appreciation
you're looking for,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.494
you might want
to start with a bath.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.496
Aw, I feel bad.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.630
I think we hurt his pride.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.499
Don't.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.168
He's a modern-day caveman.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.904
He just needs to find something
to smash with a rock.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.539
He does have a point, though.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.842
With Tom preoccupied,
it'd be the perfect time

11:48.942 --> 11:50.577
to go through his place.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.246
Mm, I do need all the evidence
I can get before my meeting.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.148
Well, there's
no question that we are

11:55.248 --> 11:56.784
a lot more discreet than Hoyt.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.451
And he said it himself,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.587
even if we were caught,

12:00.788 --> 12:02.255
we both work for Tom.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224
We'd have a reason to be there.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.432
You ever cross paths
with this McDowd?

12:12.532 --> 12:13.566
Nope.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.571
Must be a big bounty on his head
if Gil Santiago is chasing him.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.108
Mm-hmm.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.412
I know I've been
distracted lately.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.914
Distracted by what?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.682
Just tell me,
because I can't make sense

12:29.817 --> 12:30.851
of anything you do anymore.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.653
I'm the same person, Augustus.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.622
I haven't changed.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.924
Same person.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.493
Well, maybe you haven't
been paying attention.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.196
But two weeks ago,
you wouldn't step foot in town.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.899
And now you're sitting around
at Hagan's with Abby Walker,

12:45.999 --> 12:48.635
a stranger,
and Hoyt Rawlins, a low-life.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.204
Why?

12:52.840 --> 12:55.042
I was trying
to protect a friend.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.345
And here I was
thinking we were friends.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.982
We used to have
each other's backs.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.118
But now I see
I got to watch my own.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.526
Calian, I presume?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.229
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.365
I've heard talk
of this Eli McDowd.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.967
He's got
a reputation for being one

13:20.067 --> 13:22.302
crafty bastard,
he's dangerous.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.871
Got a dozen notches on his belt.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.874
If we get close, I go in first.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.709
Nobody makes a move
unless I say so. You got it?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.413
Understood.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.182
Good. Let's ride.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.685
Hyah.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.965
The widow of a lawman
and a Pinkerton agent

13:52.065 --> 13:53.566
breaking
into the sheriff's house?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.336
Is this crazy?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.372
Yeah.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.507
Right.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.914
All right, he keeps
his papers in his desk.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.916
And here's some crates
he hasn't unpacked yet.

14:08.916 --> 14:12.419
Oh, great. You take one,
I'll take the other, huh?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.155
What are you?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.062
Abby?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.696
- Find something?
- Well, sort of.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.999
I know that Boston's a big
place, but Tom is from there,

14:26.099 --> 14:27.300
all the Davidsons
are from there.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.436
Did you ever hear
about them back home?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.638
No. First time
I heard of them was

14:31.738 --> 14:33.206
when Hoyt told me
about them at Hagan's.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.474
All right, well,
what about Liam?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.475
Do you think
he might have known them?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.210
Liam was a police officer.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.946
I'm sure
he knew lots of people.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.414
Fair enough.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.656
Abby?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.258
Kate.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.792
It is a coincidence, though.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.462
Both Tom and Liam,
two men from Boston,

14:55.562 --> 14:57.397
should leave home,
wind up all the way in Texas,

14:57.497 --> 15:00.400
and both be hired as the sheriff
of the same little town.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.803
I'd prefer not
to think about what

15:03.971 --> 15:06.073
my late husband and his murderer
have in common.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.474
Fine, it's...

15:08.375 --> 15:10.010
It's a hell
of a coincidence, Abby.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.579
Of all the sheriffs' jobs
in all the country, why here?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.081
Why Independence,
where the Davidsons

15:14.181 --> 15:15.983
have their bloody hands
on everything? It's...

15:15.983 --> 15:17.817
I can't speak for the Davidsons.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.752
Liam and I
weren't happy in Boston.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.355
We needed a fresh start.
Independence had a job.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.790
He took it.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.492
What? As his wife,
you never questioned this?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.796
Don't speak to things
you know nothing about, Kate.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.768
- Kate, I...
- Shh.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.038
Did you hear that?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.832
You mind pointing
those someplace else?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.305
You two stole my idea.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.041
Well, we figured
we'd have a better chance

16:14.041 --> 16:15.375
of sneaking in than you.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.110
Yes, clearly we were
horribly mistaken.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.212
Still my idea.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.049
Well, did you get lost? We beat
you by a good ten minutes.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.385
Well, after what you said,
thought I'd freshen up a bit.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.819
You just point those baby blues

16:26.919 --> 16:29.056
at some boxes,
we can get out of here faster.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
What'd y'all find so far?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.526
A whole lot of nothing.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.629
I bet it's 'cause
you don't know where to look

16:36.729 --> 16:38.431
for Tom's secrets.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.400
You got to think
like a criminal.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.369
Yeah? How do we do that? Get
kicked in the head by a horse?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.403
Twice.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.804
The floor.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.774
I'd bet my life
Tom has a hidden place

16:47.874 --> 16:49.842
under one
of these loose floorboards.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.851
It's gonna be in one of these.
You'll see.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.320
Kate, Hoyt.
Look at this.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.255
Hmm?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.623
I was gonna check the books.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.225
Soon as I was finished
with the floor.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.693
It's a list of companies.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.628
- Chamlee Mining Works.
- What about them?

17:08.728 --> 17:09.729
They were the ones
that had the offer

17:09.829 --> 17:11.131
to buy the Sullivans' land.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.933
Mm, Laredo Pines Company.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.469
All of our liquor
orders at Hagan's

17:16.569 --> 17:18.271
list Laredo Pines as the buyer.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.739
But only since Tom took over.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.474
This must be how
the Davidsons are buying

17:21.574 --> 17:23.343
- things in secret.
- Hmm.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.677
Could help us unravel what else

17:24.777 --> 17:26.146
they're buying and why.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.247
Yeah.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.715
That's just what I was thinking.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.320
Why would McDowd
come to Independence?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.556
There's bigger towns out there
if you want to disappear.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.558
Why not ride for the border?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.827
It doesn't matter
where McDowd goes.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.196
With Santiago on his trail,
he's got nowhere to run.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.765
You're not out here
for your opinions, Deputy.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.571
Whoa.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.840
What is it?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.976
These tracks.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.512
Something's not right.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.149
Like what?

18:02.149 --> 18:05.185
For a man on the run,
McDowd's not moving very fast.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.220
We should push on.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.521
Sooner we find McDowd,
the better.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.223
I'll take the long gun

18:10.323 --> 18:11.691
and head up the canyon.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.326
If McDowd's drawing us in
for an ambush,

18:13.426 --> 18:15.027
I'd be able to pick him off.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.196
No.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.267
Come on.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.371
Sheriff, his warrant
says "dead or alive."

18:24.471 --> 18:26.038
Do you really think
a man like McDowd's

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
just going to surrender
if we find him?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.176
No, a man like that,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.043
only way they go peacefully
is in a pine box.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.545
Damn it, Gus!

18:32.645 --> 18:34.181
Button your lip
and stay behind me!

18:34.181 --> 18:37.083
You care to have
that tone with me again?

18:39.018 --> 18:41.254
We need to keep moving is all.
Let's go.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.193
Yeah.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.700
So, did you send the list
of companies to Ethan?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.835
I just sent the telegraph.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.370
That was good work back there.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.906
Even you.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.876
Oh, sure, knock old Hoyt down.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.846
But don't y'all forget
who the real outlaw is.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.282
Lookee here.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.383
What is that?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.084
It's silver. I think.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.053
Took it from Tom's place.
I collect 'em.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.622
You guys don't
know everything about me.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.824
Apparently we do not.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.759
You contain multitudes.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.030
Hey. I want to play a game.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.798
I ask you one question,

19:25.898 --> 19:27.367
and you have
to answer honestly. Yeah?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.101
Fine. One.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.703
All right. I'll go first.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.838
All right.

19:32.639 --> 19:37.444
Tell me one thing about you
that nobody else knows.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.546
Oh. Easy.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.650
I have a birthmark on my butt
in the shape of a...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.084
Strawberry.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.020
We stopped at a watering hole.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.689
He's an exhibitionist.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.724
(Hoyt laughs

19:51.824 --> 19:53.826
Hello, Strawberry.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.962
All right. Now you.

19:56.829 --> 20:01.067
Right, uh,
something nobody knows.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.340
My father
was never fond of Liam.

20:07.440 --> 20:12.545
He wasn't from that world
and Daddy didn't trust him.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.250
So, at first,
I had to sneak out to meet him.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.621
And of course
Liam didn't have much money,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.823
so he surprised me.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.328
With a picnic
at the Boston Public Gardens.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.830
But all he brought
were a couple of apples.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.432
I was starving.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.466
We talked for hours.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.801
We stayed out so late,

20:34.901 --> 20:36.235
we watched the lamplighter
go to work.

20:37.337 --> 20:43.242
My father was furious,
but it didn't matter.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.946
I knew Liam was the one.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.882
Oh, so, he defied
your father then?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.884
Abby, would you say
that he was a risk taker?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.786
Would you say
that he was reckless?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.655
- Kate.
- Do you think that going

20:55.755 --> 20:56.789
west was an impulsive thing?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.391
Or could
he have been running away

20:58.491 --> 21:00.226
from enemies, I don't know,
say, in the Boston police?

21:00.327 --> 21:02.061
What exactly
are you asking, Kate?

21:02.161 --> 21:03.996
I am asking you how well
you knew your husband.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.633
Excuse me.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.077
Hey, Hoyt,
you want to go to the bar?

21:18.177 --> 21:19.479
Indeed, I do.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.622
What'd you find?

21:29.722 --> 21:31.057
Tracks.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.026
They make no sense.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.462
Well, maybe he's doubling back?

21:35.562 --> 21:39.366
No. More like he has
no direction at all.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.580
Stay back.

22:13.299 --> 22:14.501
- Damn it.
- Sheriff?

22:14.601 --> 22:15.968
He was never here.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.404
He weighed down the saddlebags

22:17.504 --> 22:18.938
to mimic a horse
carrying a rider.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.172
That's why it
never broke a trot.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.140
He sent us
on a wild goose chase.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.475
But where would he go?

22:23.743 --> 22:27.614
You two carry on further in case
he went that way on foot. Hyah!

22:35.455 --> 22:37.690
There's no way he's back there.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.655
I know you see it.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.457
The sheriff's hiding something.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.325
He ain't the only one.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.531
If you've lost your trust
in me, Augustus, I'm sorry.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.535
I'd like the chance
to earn it back.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.541
I think you're right
about Tom.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.511
My gut says that him
and McDowd have history.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.980
Watch the way he rode off?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.482
Headed back to town.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.717
I think we should head
that way ourselves.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.688
Well, let's ride.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.533
<i>So, by the time they open
the boxcar, I'm long gone.</i>

23:53.633 --> 23:56.135
And that, my friend,
is how I robbed

23:56.235 --> 23:58.004
the Lindale train
coming and going...

23:58.104 --> 24:00.573
- Oof.
- ...all in the same day.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.976
- That is quite a feat.
- Yeah?

24:04.076 --> 24:06.345
You know, when I do
a double like that,

24:06.513 --> 24:07.780
I usually go
for something a little bigger

24:07.880 --> 24:10.382
like the Houston
and Texas Central.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.052
The H&TC?

24:13.152 --> 24:14.220
Yeah.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.056
Well, that's-that's
the biggest train in Texas.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.525
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.292
Everybody's got
to start somewhere.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.529
Evening, Sheriff.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.598
You're on your own, friend.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.903
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

24:31.003 --> 24:33.673
Belly up, Tommy. I hear
you own the place after all.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.407
Look, this isn't good
for either of us.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.643
Why's that?

24:36.743 --> 24:37.577
Because you're a wanted fugitive

24:37.677 --> 24:38.578
and I'm the damn sheriff.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.547
Oh, I noticed that, yeah.

24:40.547 --> 24:41.948
It's like Texarkana
but even better.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.350
Here you are,
lawman, businessman,

24:44.450 --> 24:46.385
feared and respected
by all these people.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.920
- That's enough.
- No, no, Tommy boy.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.455
Just-just-just
hear me out, okay?

24:49.556 --> 24:50.690
Hey, look, it got me
thinking, right?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.692
Opening that cantina
in Mexico

24:52.792 --> 24:54.561
was a little far-fetched,
I admit it.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.628
And why bother?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.429
You found paradise right here.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.099
It's time for you to go now.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.096
<i>Just don't like to think
you're hiding something from me.</i>

25:30.897 --> 25:34.667
<i>I love you more
than you will ever know.</i>

25:36.168 --> 25:37.469
<i>That's my only secret.</i>

26:04.631 --> 26:06.733
We can run this place together,
like old times.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.334
This little trouble I'm in,

26:08.434 --> 26:10.069
- you can end it,
you can protect me.
- Protect you?

26:10.169 --> 26:12.071
All you got to do is pin
a deputy star on my chest.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.641
- Have you lost your damn mind?
- No.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.743
No, I-I'm seeing things
really clearly.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.811
Tommy, I think I like this town,

26:18.911 --> 26:20.312
all these nice folks,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.014
so, yeah, maybe I'll settle in.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.083
We can get to know
each other a little better.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.985
I'm sorry, Tom,
somebody catch your eye?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.687
No. Abby's just an employee.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.388
Oh, is that all?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.824
You need to stop stalling and
get on your horse and you go.

26:31.924 --> 26:32.859
- Let's go.
- Hey.

26:32.959 --> 26:33.960
I'm waiting on your answer.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.327
Are you gonna make me a deputy?

26:35.427 --> 26:36.996
You listen to me, okay?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.731
Things aren't
like the old days.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.199
I work for my family now.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.434
They do not tolerate
unnecessary risk.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.770
You understand what I'm saying?

26:45.905 --> 26:47.907
Yeah, Tommy, I think I do.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.408
Well, then
you answer me this, okay?

26:49.508 --> 26:51.978
How long, do you think,
until the good people

26:52.078 --> 26:54.513
of Independence find out what
kind of a man you really are?

26:54.681 --> 26:55.682
Sheriff.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.316
Whoa...

26:57.416 --> 26:58.685
Hey, look.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.368
McDowd!

27:16.468 --> 27:17.970
Throw down your guns!

27:30.717 --> 27:31.984
Sheriff?

27:37.056 --> 27:38.357
What's the play here?

27:42.729 --> 27:44.396
Throw 'em down, McDowd.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.739
Come and take 'em,
you son of a bitch.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.848
Stay down till it's over.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.151
You're hit.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.920
Oh, damn it!

28:20.332 --> 28:22.401
Come here.

28:23.569 --> 28:24.536
Careful!

28:24.636 --> 28:26.672
Lower your guns.

28:41.587 --> 28:42.855
Stay down.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.926
- Get your hands off me.
- Shh.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.360
Hoyt, stand down.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.495
Let him go.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.408
Let go of me.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.915
- Hey, hey!
- Kate! No!

29:12.718 --> 29:14.987
What do you want to do?

29:16.722 --> 29:18.357
I'm gonna go up there.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.926
Wait, why you?

29:20.026 --> 29:21.293
Let me go.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.029
No. You're gonna
want to let him

29:23.129 --> 29:25.932
go talk to his friend alone.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.901
You want to save Abby?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.837
I'm your best bet.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.471
Okay?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.907
If these so-called bounty
hunters do anything stupid,

29:35.007 --> 29:36.242
shoot 'em.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.114
I do hate bounty hunters.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.483
One thing we can agree on.

29:44.583 --> 29:45.651
All right.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.654
Everybody take it easy.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.691
Who are you?
Another one of Tom's employees?

29:52.859 --> 29:55.527
Of course you would be up here,
saving yourself.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.500
You know what? It would be
better if you did shoot me.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.302
Because then I wouldn't have to
be in another room with you...

30:03.402 --> 30:06.305
You walk around here like you're
better than everyone else.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.606
- Let me tell you something!
- You know what?

30:07.706 --> 30:09.008
- All of this is your fault!
- Kate!

30:09.108 --> 30:10.609
- Kate, go!
- Hey!

30:12.444 --> 30:14.313
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

30:14.413 --> 30:17.483
So, you're that outlaw
that everyone's after, right?

30:18.517 --> 30:19.818
And you're Abby.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.420
Your boss told me.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.024
Oh, yeah, you two were
chatting at the bar.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.994
Didn't seem altogether
friendly, was it?

30:28.094 --> 30:30.529
Oh, I can see why
you've got his attention.

30:30.629 --> 30:31.730
Hmm.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.033
Did you know him in Texarkana?

30:34.133 --> 30:35.801
I don't know
what you're on about,

30:35.902 --> 30:38.137
but I'll tell you this for free.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.538
Your sheriff down there

30:39.638 --> 30:41.007
might be the most
dangerous man in Texas.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.509
- Eli.
- Hey.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.610
I'm unarmed.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.046
What took you so long, Tommy?

30:47.146 --> 30:48.547
Come on.
Let's get me a fresh horse

30:48.647 --> 30:50.016
- so I can get the hell
out of here.
- Eli.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.283
No, no, no,
you distract 'em, Tom.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.384
- I'm-a slip out...
- That's enough.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.554
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.126
I guess not.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.561
I'm sorry.
I can't help you here.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.330
I'm working to build
something in this town

31:04.430 --> 31:05.664
that's bigger
than you and me both.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.503
Whoa.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.939
I wish we'd gone
to Mexico, Tommy.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.340
I wish you'd gone to Mexico.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.508
Yeah, wouldn't have made
much of a difference.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.610
There's no place I can run
Santiago won't find me.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.679
Then stop running.
Turn yourself in.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.448
He'll gut me
in the street, Tommy.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.150
No! No!
I will take you in myself.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.617
You're gonna get the rope.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.821
It's better
than the alternative.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.292
Just another
weary outlaw, huh, Tom?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.995
Tired and small.

31:36.095 --> 31:40.266
Getting his neck stretched
out for a crowd of people.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.637
Spare me from that,
won't you, Tommy?

31:54.546 --> 31:56.848
You can't be serious. No.

31:56.983 --> 31:57.883
Hey, hey, there's another way.

31:57.984 --> 31:58.985
- Let us help you.
- Yeah.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.053
Maybe in another life, okay?

32:01.153 --> 32:02.654
Tommy, I know I done wrong.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.756
And I know
I don't deserve it,

32:04.856 --> 32:06.592
but there must be
some small bit of grace here

32:06.692 --> 32:08.627
for me here at the end, yeah?
Come on, Tommy.

32:08.727 --> 32:09.661
Come on.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.563
I will not do this for you.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.700
Hey! Hey, hey.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.135
Please don't
make me hurt her, Tom.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.004
Hey, hey, put it down.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.271
Eli, we can work this out.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.339
There's still
one way you can help me.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.473
I'm not gonna do that for you!

32:21.573 --> 32:23.009
- Now or never, Tom!
- Eli!

32:42.494 --> 32:44.396
No, no, no, no, no.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.098
Eli. Come on.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.733
Stay with me...

32:48.600 --> 32:50.936
No, no, no, no, no!

36:00.426 --> 36:01.993
Thank you.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.334
You would have done the same.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.803
And you might yet.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.240
That's true.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.009
Kate, I'm sorry.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.846
About earlier, what I said.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.248
Come here.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.918
I know-- I know that
what I said to you

36:27.018 --> 36:29.087
about Liam hurt you.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.757
And I'm sorry.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.261
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.931
But I'm not sorry for asking
you difficult questions.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.567
Because I care about you.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.702
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to help you.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.304
And right now
that means building

36:45.404 --> 36:48.840
the best possible case
to take Tom down.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.943
You're right.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.280
Am I?

36:54.380 --> 36:58.817
The truth is,
Liam wasn't perfect.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.521
I don't know
everything that happened

37:02.621 --> 37:03.922
with the police in Boston,

37:04.022 --> 37:05.724
I don't know if he had enemies.

37:05.824 --> 37:09.761
Or if we were running
from them when we came here.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.297
Or even
our last night together,

37:11.297 --> 37:13.632
I thought he might be hiding
something from me.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.501
I'm sorry, Abby.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.636
To answer your question,

37:17.736 --> 37:20.606
I don't know
how well I knew my husband.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.775
But I promise you...

37:24.810 --> 37:30.215
I am ready to face the truth,
wherever it may lead.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.385
I have to ask you
one more question.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.354
- It's just one. I promise.
- All right. All right.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.488
It's my job.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.192
What did you see in there?

37:43.061 --> 37:44.430
With Tom?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.533
I saw a criminal.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.336
The killer we know he is.

37:52.971 --> 37:57.242
But I also saw a scared,

37:57.343 --> 38:01.046
heartbroken man giving up

38:01.146 --> 38:04.182
something he loved very dearly.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.168
Sheriff.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.009
Glad to see
you're doing all right.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.210
I wanted to thank you.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.680
For what you did.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.251
You were very brave.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.020
Trying to talk him
down like that.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.724
But you can't reason
with a desperate man.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.061
He was a friend.
Wasn't he?

38:52.297 --> 38:54.666
He told me you were dangerous.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.770
I turned a blind eye
to some things

38:58.870 --> 39:00.972
in Texarkana I shouldn't have.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.609
The past is hard
to face, isn't it?

39:05.944 --> 39:09.180
Maybe we should all be judged
on what we do with today,

39:09.280 --> 39:11.182
Miss Walker.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.194
I can't talk right now.
Tom will be back soon.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.497
I'm not sure
this can wait any longer.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.836
The way I see it,
everybody who knows

39:30.936 --> 39:33.905
something about
Tom Davidson winds up dead.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.441
Eli McDowd.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.643
- Just like Griffin...
- You can stop there.

39:38.544 --> 39:41.246
What did McDowd know
that Tom wanted buried with him?

39:42.448 --> 39:43.582
Tell me you aren't suspicious.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.584
What do you want me to say?

39:45.684 --> 39:47.853
That something's wrong
in this town?

39:47.953 --> 39:49.555
Of course something's wrong.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.724
I mean, damn, does everybody
think I'm a fool?

39:52.824 --> 39:54.793
Look, I knew Tom
was hiding something,

39:54.893 --> 39:55.961
just like I knew you were.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.729
I'm not hiding anymore.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.932
I'm tired
of watching the bodies pile up.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.907
And Tom murdered Liam Collins.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.884
I wish you had come
to me sooner.

40:18.984 --> 40:22.954
I mean, why wouldn't you trust
me with something like this?

40:24.656 --> 40:27.192
I think I know
who murdered Liam Collins.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.062
And it wasn't Tom.
