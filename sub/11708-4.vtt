WHAT A FUCKIN' WEIRDO.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.356
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIS NAME WAS.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.983
FUCKIN' WEIRD.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.860
- DO YOU BANG THEM?

09:29.944 --> 09:31.696
- THAT MEANS "YES."
- I'M GONNA PLEAD THE FIFTH.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.198
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
- [laughing]

09:34.282 --> 09:36.993
- LET'S JUST GET THIS SET UP.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.869
- OH! HUH!

09:38.953 --> 09:41.664
- HOW ARE YOU DOING YOURS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:41.747 --> 09:45.334
- FOUR "OVER THE HILL"
AND "SIX BOOBS."

09:45.418 --> 09:46.168
- WE GOTTA GET SHIT READY.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.713
- I WAS GONNA PUT IT HERE.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.841
- YEAH, THAT'S CUTE.
- I'M GONNA HANG THIS UP.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.676
- THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARTY.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.636
- LET'S GET IT, BRO.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.056
- YO, MIKE.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.976
- I'M COMING, I'M COMING.
- JENNI ALREADY LEFT, COME ON.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.519
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.021
- I'M GONNA TRY NOT
TO BE LATE FOR WORK,

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
BUT THE TIME ON MY WATCH SAYS
THAT I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR WORK

10:07.189 --> 10:10.151
AFTER DANNY ALREADY BITCHED US
OUT FOR NOT WORKING HARD.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.153
FUCK.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.658
- HI!

10:17.742 --> 10:20.369
- JENNI,
WHERE IS THE OTHER GUYS?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.330
- UM.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.873
I DON'T KNOW.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.459
- EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.960
IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A WALL
WITH YOU GUYS.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.378
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
- LISTEN, I GET IT.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.381
- I'M NOT TRYING TO SHIT
ON YOU, 'CAUSE YOU ARE HERE,

10:32.465 --> 10:33.674
BUT--
- WELL--

10:33.758 --> 10:36.052
- DID YOU GUYS HAVE ANY KIND
OF CONVERSATION

10:36.135 --> 10:37.345
WHEN I LEFT YESTERDAY?
YOU GUYS LIKE,

10:37.428 --> 10:38.971
"OKAY, WE'RE GONNA STEP IT UP
A LITTLE BIT?"

10:39.055 --> 10:42.975
OR WAS IT MORE LIKE,
"BIG FREAKIN' DEAL"?

10:45.561 --> 10:47.855
NOTHING?

10:58.532 --> 11:02.953
RONNIE!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.664
- NO BREAKS FOR ME TODAY,
THAT'S ALL.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.958
- I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT
FROM YOU.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.752
AT LEAST YOU SHOW UP IN UNIFORM,
READY TO WORK.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.297
THIS GUY SHOWS UP
OUT OF UNIFORM <i> AND</i> LATE!

11:13.381 --> 11:14.006
- BUT I STILL
LOOK GOOD THOUGH.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.217
[laughing]

11:16.300 --> 11:17.176
- SHIT.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.261
THAT'S IN YOUR OWN MIND,
PLAYER.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.388
- HI.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

11:20.471 --> 11:23.391
- I SAW THE THING OUTSIDE
ABOUT THE JOB.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.600
- OH, YOU DID?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

11:24.683 --> 11:25.768
- 21.
- PERFECT.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.562
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SALES?
- OF COURSE.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.689
- JENNI.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:30.773 --> 11:31.190
- ALISSA.
- ALISSA?

11:31.273 --> 11:33.818
- MM-HMM.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.820
- MIKE, YOU WANNA TALK TO ALISSA
FOR A SECOND?

11:35.903 --> 11:38.030
SEE IF YOU GUYS MESH.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.949
YEAH, I'M GOING TO GET A COLD
COFFEE WITH HER.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.451
- "WE'RE GONNA GO GET COFFEE
TOGETHER," HE SAID.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.245
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET COFFEE.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.539
YOU'RE NOT GOING ON A DATE.
- LET'S GO GET COFFEE.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.499
- I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB.
- YOU SAW THE SIGN?

11:48.582 --> 11:49.667
- YES, I DID.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.459
- EXCELLENT.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.920
- I AM 22.
- 22.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.922
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
IN SALES BEFORE?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.298
- I'VE WORKED IN RETAIL.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.134
- SHE'S KINDA CUTE.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.554
THE FUCKIN' MICHAEL JACKSON HAT
HAS TO GO.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.806
- YOU SEEM LIKE A PERFECT FIT
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.141
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU, OKAY?
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.227
- HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO DANNY'S GONNA PICK.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.771
BUT I HATE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE
ABOUT TO GET NEW ROOMMATES.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.481
SO THEY'RE ALL GUILTY
IN MY BOOK

12:12.565 --> 12:14.275
AND I'M JUST LOOKING
AT 'EM LIKE,

12:14.358 --> 12:17.319
"YEAH, GO FUCK YOURSELVES."

12:17.403 --> 12:19.530
GONNA CHECK THIS SIGN OUT.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.157
SO I FIND OUT THE REASON

12:21.240 --> 12:22.741
WHY THESE PEOPLE
KEEP GETTING INTERVIEWED

12:22.825 --> 12:24.743
IS BECAUSE THERE'S A HELP WANTED
SIGN OUT ON THE FRONT.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.289
REALLY?
A FUCKING HELP WANTED SIGN?

12:28.372 --> 12:31.625
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.797
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY!

12:36.881 --> 12:38.382
[whistle blows]
- PAULY!

12:38.466 --> 12:40.426
DID YOU SEE THAT?
- WOW!

12:40.509 --> 12:43.304
- AND MIKE GOT AN ASS.
[Pauly laughing]

12:43.387 --> 12:44.847
- I SEE LIKE A CHICK FIGHT.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.349
THEN I LOOK OVER, I'M LIKE,
"HOLY SHIT, IT'S SAM.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.736
- GONNA CHECK THIS SIGN OUT.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.156
REALLY?
A FUCKING HELP WANTED SIGN?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.616
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.160
I JUST RIPPED DOWN THE SIGN.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.453
- [laughing] DID YOU?

13:07.536 --> 13:09.705
- IF I ELIMINATE
THE HELP WANTED SIGN,

13:09.788 --> 13:11.540
THERE WILL BE
NO MORE INTERVIEWS.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.459
AND THEREFORE THERE WILL BE
NO MORE POSSIBILITIES

13:13.542 --> 13:16.504
OF GETTING NEW ROOMMATES.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.006
- SO WHERE'S THE SIGN?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.508
WHY DON'T YOU
DO ME A FAVOR

13:20.591 --> 13:21.884
AND WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ME
A NEW ONE REAL QUICK?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.219
- "HELP WANTED, GO AWAY"?

13:23.302 --> 13:26.388
- "HELP WANTED."
THAT'S IT.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.893
- WHAT'S A GOOD NAME FOR DANNY
SINCE HE'S BEING A DOUCHE?

13:30.976 --> 13:36.565
- "HELP WANTED,
SEE THE OLD DUDE."

13:36.649 --> 13:38.609
- HE MIGHT THINK IT'S YOU.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.909
- EXCELLENCE.
THANK YOU.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.203
NOW PLEASE LEAVE THIS ONE UP.

13:49.286 --> 13:54.041
I NEED MORE PEOPLE WHO WORK.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.335
YOU'RE THE MAIN REASON
WHY THIS SIGN'S GOING UP, MIKE.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.754
- I MEAN, HONESTLY,
IT'S LIKE...

13:58.837 --> 14:01.799
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIKE THIS.
- ME NEITHER.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.133
- I DON'T.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.260
IF WE HAVE TO GET ROOMMATES
THEN...

14:04.343 --> 14:05.636
THAT JUST BREAKS MY HEART

14:05.719 --> 14:06.929
'CAUSE WE LITERALLY
BEEN THROUGH IT ALL--

14:07.012 --> 14:09.265
MAKE-UPS, BREAK-UPS,
THE UPS AND DOWNS.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.517
SO WHOEVER COMES IN THIS HOUSE
WILL NEVER GET IT.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.935
- I HOPE I WALK INTO THAT HOUSE
AND FUCKIN' VIN'S THERE.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.480
- THE GIRLS CALLED.
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

14:16.564 --> 14:19.692
- BASICALLY,
"HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND."

14:19.775 --> 14:21.610
- YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

14:21.694 --> 14:22.903
- AT THIS POINT,
IT'S LIKE REGARDLESS,

14:22.987 --> 14:25.823
WE'RE PROBABLY GETTING
NEW PEOPLE.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.575
- IF THE NEW ROOMMATE'S
COMING,

14:27.658 --> 14:29.285
WE'LL MAKE IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR THEM TO LIVE HERE.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.619
THIS IS OUR FUCKING HOUSE.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.871
THIS IS OUR FIFTH HOUSE
TOGETHER,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.290
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO

14:34.373 --> 14:36.834
THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN THIS HOUSE.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.961
GO BACK TO WORK.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.139
- BUCKLE UP!

14:50.222 --> 14:52.975
- WE HAVE TO GO UP TO PARTY LANE
TO GET FUN GIFTS FOR THE BOYS.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.061
- GOTTA SHOW OFF MY TAT.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.314
DON'T MESS WITH ME IN HERE,
PARTY LANE.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.858
OH, THE PARTY'S HERE.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.321
CAN I TRY ON THE...BUNNY?
THE BUNNY?

15:05.404 --> 15:06.739
- THESE?

15:06.822 --> 15:11.118
OH, IT SMELLS.
- JUST PUT IT ON.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.706
[both giggling]

15:15.789 --> 15:19.001
- LET'S HAVE BUNNY SEX.

15:19.084 --> 15:19.793
[giggling]

15:19.877 --> 15:23.631
I WONDER IF WE LOOK FUNNY.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.008
- LET'S KISS.
BUNNY KISS.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.135
- OH, DEE, I LOVE THIS.
THINK I'M GONNA BUY IT.

15:28.218 --> 15:32.014
I FEEL LIKE THE HOUSE NEEDS
SOMETHING CRAZY GOING ON.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.891
SO IF WE NEED A FREAKIN'
BUNNY SUIT

15:33.974 --> 15:35.351
TO BRING LIFE TO THIS HOUSE,

15:35.434 --> 15:38.228
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW
WE HAVE PROBLEMS.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.690
OH, MY GOD,
IF THESE POP WHEN YOU DRIVE,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.359
WE'RE GONNA GET INTO
AN ACCIDENT.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.778
NO! NO!

15:46.987 --> 15:48.364
- WHAT CLUB WE
GOING TO TONIGHT?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.407
- KARMA.
- OKAY.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.160
- IT'S THE NIGHT OF PAULY
AND MIKE'S SURPRISE PARTY.

15:53.243 --> 15:57.373
I'M TRYING TO RELAX,
BUT I'M FREAKING OUT.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.627
[knocking]

16:01.710 --> 16:03.962
- THERE'S MY BITCH.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
- [laughing]

16:06.131 --> 16:10.511
WHAT ARE YOU, THE FUCKIN'
PURPLE PEOPLE EATER TONIGHT?

16:10.594 --> 16:13.263
- I REALLY WANNA BRING HOME
A CHICK TONIGHT REAL BAD.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.890
SO I, LIKE,
CLEANED MY WHOLE ROOM.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.225
THE ROOM IS PRETTY CLEAN,
RIGHT?

16:16.308 --> 16:17.726
- YEAH, IT'S CLEAN.
YOU DID GOOD.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.895
I DON'T THINK MIKE HAS A CLUE
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.231
- LET'S GO!
- YEAH, YEAH!

16:22.314 --> 16:24.149
CARS HERE! CARS HERE!
CARS HERE!

16:24.233 --> 16:25.943
FREAKIN' CARS ARE HERE!

16:28.654 --> 16:29.905
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

16:29.988 --> 16:30.572
- KARMA'S A BITCH.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.158
- THURSDAY NIGHT, BABY.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.620
- OH, GOD, I'M FREAKING OUT
RIGHT NOW.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.126
- I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR PAULY
AND MIKE'S REACTION TONIGHT.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.795
THEY HAVE NO IDEA,
LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.964
I ASKED PAULY, I'M LIKE,
"PAULY, YOU DRINKING TONIGHT?"

16:47.047 --> 16:48.924
"UH, PROBABLY GONNA
TAKE IT EASY."

16:49.007 --> 16:50.801
I'M LIKE,
"THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK."

16:54.805 --> 16:57.850
all: SURPRISE!

16:59.518 --> 17:00.894
[cheering]

17:00.978 --> 17:01.979
- DON'T GET ME!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.147
[cheering]

17:03.230 --> 17:05.315
- IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO SURPRISE ME.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.358
I MEAN, I'M PRETTY PARANOID,
YOU KNOW?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.862
BUT I WAS DEFINITELY SURPRISED.
I HAD NO IDEA.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.363
- AAAHH!

17:11.446 --> 17:12.156
IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY!

17:12.239 --> 17:14.366
- HOW YOU GET THIS GUY HERE?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.951
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.161
I WAS JUST THINKING,
"NO MORE THURSDAY NIGHT."

17:17.243 --> 17:18.454
MY BIRTHDAY'S ALREADY PASSED.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.414
I WAS NOT EXPECTING
ANOTHER PARTY.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.876
- I HAD NO IDEA, BRO,
NO IDEA.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.669
- PAULY!

17:25.752 --> 17:27.671
DID YOU SEE THAT?
- WOW!

17:27.755 --> 17:29.673
- AND MIKE GOT AN ASS.
[Pauly laughing]

17:29.757 --> 17:31.008
- YES! WE DID IT.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.594
- YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.803
- PAULY AND MIKE ARE SO HAPPY,
SMILING,

17:34.887 --> 17:36.972
AND I'M LIKE,
"ALL THIS FUCKIN' STRESS

17:37.055 --> 17:38.724
WAS WORTH IT."

17:38.807 --> 17:40.142
- THANK YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
- LOVE YOU TOO.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.895
I FEEL REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.354
ALL THE GIRLS PLANNED
THIS REALLY NICE BIRTHDAY.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.481
IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.816
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
[all cheering]

17:47.900 --> 17:52.112
- LOVE YOU!
LOVE YOU!

17:52.196 --> 17:55.199
- YEAH. YEAH.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.243
- SIT IN IT.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.836
- YO, I'M TOO OLD.
I CAN'T GET IT UP.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.546
NEED MY VIAGRA.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.673
- WHOA, WHOA!

18:11.757 --> 18:14.092
- OW.
- NOW WAIT.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.969
- YOU'VE HAD THIS BEFORE.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.763
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.389
I DON'T KNOW IF SOME DUDE
WITH A WHIP'S GONNA COME OUT.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.266
SOME UGLY CHICK'S COMING OUT
OF A CAKE.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.476
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS
RIGHT NOW.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.144
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.233
GONNA BE A GUY OR SOMETHING.

18:32.528 --> 18:36.865
- THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD
HAVE YOUR HANDCUFFS ON.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.119
- SAM GETTING INTO A FIGHT

18:41.203 --> 18:42.538
DEFINITELY IS SOME SCARY SHIT.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.999
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.257
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.092
OW!

18:55.175 --> 18:57.719
WHO'S JUMPING OUT
OF THIS CAKE?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.388
