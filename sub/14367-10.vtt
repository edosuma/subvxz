00:51.718 --> 00:54.596
{\an8}Due to a scheduling conflict

00:54.679 --> 00:59.142
{\an8}the date for school picture day
has been changed.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.395
{\an8}Um, the new date
for school picture day

01:02.479 --> 01:04.188
{\an8}which has been changed

01:04.272 --> 01:05.857
{\an8}is this Friday.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.150
{\an7}Friday?
Is Chet out of his mind?

01:07.233 --> 01:11.696
{\an7}That's two full weeks earlier
than originally scheduled!

01:11.780 --> 01:15.325
{\an8}Oh, I totally dread picture day.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.826
{\an8}Well, you girls
better start stocking up

01:16.910 --> 01:19.621
{\an8}on your beauty sleep.
(<i> laughs</i> )

01:19.704 --> 01:22.123
{\an8}You're going to need it.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.877
{\an8}DODIE:
What is it about school pictures
that reminds me

01:25.960 --> 01:27.170
{\an8}of absolutely
nothing

01:27.253 --> 01:28.671
{\an8}except the day I
took school pictures?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.840
GINGER:
Look at me...

01:30.924 --> 01:34.093
my eyes have been closed
since first grade.

01:34.177 --> 01:38.181
My mother says I look like
my great aunt Brigette in mine.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.016
She never married.

01:40.099 --> 01:40.642
{\an8}Oh, I don't know.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.520
{\an8}All school
pictures stink.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.313
{\an8}It's practically
the law.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.942
Courtney Gripling's
looks pretty good.

(<i> phone rings</i> )

01:50.944 --> 01:52.070
{\an1}Hello?

01:52.153 --> 01:52.487
{\an1}Hi, Ma.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.781
Dodie and Macie.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.740
Nothing, really.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.367
Tell her I said hi.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.535
Tell her!

01:58.618 --> 02:00.495
Macie says hi.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.496
{\an1}Yeah, I'll run
an errand for you.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.289
What do you need?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.667
Mom...!

02:05.750 --> 02:07.544
Seriously?

02:07.627 --> 02:10.295
Okay... bye.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.342
Antifungal cream
for her feet.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.010
{\an1}No!

02:14.425 --> 02:16.010
No!

02:16.094 --> 02:18.513
They're all out
or she'd get it from work.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.598
{\an1}That's why I always shower
in flip-flops.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.226
You can't be too safe.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.352
You just can't.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.274
It's got to be here somewhere.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.025
Why don't you
ask somebody?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.862
Right...
"Excuse me, but what row

02:33.945 --> 02:36.239
has embarrassing things
for parents?"

02:36.322 --> 02:37.615
Aisle 14.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.742
Uh... thanks.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.745
Miranda, am I more
of a Peach Mist

02:42.829 --> 02:45.039
{\an1}or an
Apricot Sparkle?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.749
Mist more than Sparkle,
no question.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.043
(<i> girls laughing</i> )

02:49.127 --> 02:50.420
{\an1}Ginger!

02:50.503 --> 02:51.754
Hi, Courtney.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.257
{\an1}Here to stock up
on cosmetics

02:54.340 --> 02:56.009
{\an1}for school picture day?
Us, too.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.178
{\an5}No, we're here
on account of
her mom's mold.

02:59.262 --> 02:59.429
Aisle Six.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.347
Thanks.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.391
Well, we should go.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.350
Tell me about it.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.602
Time is of the essence

03:05.685 --> 03:07.437
and I need to decide
on my palette

03:07.520 --> 03:10.189
and brush up on my
highlight and contour skills.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.442
{\an1}Then let's not waste
any more time.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.110
Ciao for now.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.278
{\an1}Of course!

03:15.361 --> 03:16.863
When expertly applied

03:16.946 --> 03:20.450
makeup can make all the
difference in the world!

03:20.533 --> 03:22.160
{\an1}That's Courtney's
secret.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.288
And it does explain her
perpetually rosy cheeks.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.123
{\an1}Makeup works
for Courtney Gripling

03:27.206 --> 03:29.000
{\an1}and it can work for us.
Let's shop.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.920
My mother says no makeup
until high school.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.088
{\an1}Oh, it will be too late
by high school.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.131
{\an1}Everyone will
already remember you

03:35.214 --> 03:37.425
as the pasty redhead
with lusterless lips.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.719
Oh, dear.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.012
Enough said.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.639
Let's shop.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.896
Oatmeal body blush.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.898
Twenty-two dollars?!

03:51.981 --> 03:54.108
Ooh, collagen
eye enhancer.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.443
Seventeen
dollars?!

03:55.526 --> 03:56.569
What a total rip!

03:56.653 --> 03:59.405
{\an1}I don't even know
what that junk is for.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.657
MACIE:
Jackpot!

04:00.740 --> 04:04.827
Eucalyptus cough suppressants,
a mere 66 cents.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.330
Sweet...

04:22.470 --> 04:23.888
You blinked, Carl.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.722
That's a lie.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.682
I saw you.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.808
It wasn't a blink.

04:26.891 --> 04:27.600
I winced was all.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.019
{\an1}It's different:
no lid-to-lid contact.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.521
Do my feet smell bad?

04:31.604 --> 04:32.563
(<i> sniffs</i> )

04:32.647 --> 04:35.108
No, why?

04:35.191 --> 04:37.360
I thought maybe that
was why you winced.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.696
(<i> laughing</i> )

04:39.779 --> 04:41.114
(<i> all groan</i> )

04:41.197 --> 04:43.908
Carl, it totally
stinks in here!

04:43.992 --> 04:47.370
Can't you keep
your shoes on?

04:47.453 --> 04:50.456
{\an1}No, Ginger, that's the
stench of Hoodsey's feet.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.041
I told you
they did, Carl.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.209
You lose, Hoodsey.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.460
That was a blink.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.045
{\an1}Can I use some of your
mother's antifungal cream?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.839
{\an1}If you can wait
until she gets home.

04:57.922 --> 04:58.756
You know the rules.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.633
Her bathroom
is off-limits

05:00.717 --> 05:03.094
with a capital "O".

05:03.177 --> 05:05.888
Carl, Mom spun the chore wheel
this morning, you know.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.558
You got trash and grout.

05:08.641 --> 05:08.850
Did you do it?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.185
{\an1}Ooh, cool.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.859
Come on, guys.

05:17.942 --> 05:18.609
Mildew and refuse

05:18.693 --> 05:21.404
will only distract Carl
for so long.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.780
(<i> both grunting</i> )

05:22.864 --> 05:26.743
(<i> truck approaching</i> )

05:29.037 --> 05:29.954
{\an1}CARL:
Hey, Dwayne.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.290
{\an1}Slim pickings today
or what?

05:32.373 --> 05:34.876
I scored a disinfectant puck
from a urinal

05:34.959 --> 05:36.961
that might be cool
for playing hockey.

05:37.045 --> 05:37.503
(<i> chuckles</i> )

05:37.587 --> 05:40.757
Oh, cool.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.507
You have
the best garbage!

05:41.591 --> 05:44.427
You want to see garbage,
my friend?

05:44.510 --> 05:45.970
Check me out tomorrow.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.096
Fat Friday.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.639
I can take you to a place

05:48.723 --> 05:51.934
{\an1}where even the foulest
of garbage smells sweet.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.313
Meet me here at 5:00 a.m.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.779
Wow...

06:02.862 --> 06:04.072
Oh...

06:11.370 --> 06:13.247
This is a
total violation

06:13.331 --> 06:15.166
of house rules,
you guys.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.293
We're not allowed
in there.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.129
But Ginger,
this is an emergency.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.673
Point well made.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.050
I guess I do have
an obligation

06:24.133 --> 06:27.720
to put her fungal
cream away, right?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.848
{\an5}So it doesn't get,
you know, lost
or eaten?

06:30.932 --> 06:31.974
Absolutely!

06:32.058 --> 06:34.977
{\an1}Do what you got to,
sister.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.815
ALL:
Wow...

06:38.898 --> 06:41.901
{\an5}MACIE:
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

06:41.984 --> 06:46.697
Be very, very careful.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.955
If my mom knew
we were going to

06:54.038 --> 06:55.331
sneak out at 5:00 a.m.

06:55.414 --> 06:59.127
she'd freak all the way
into the 23rd century.

06:59.210 --> 06:59.919
{\an1}Why?
Dwayne's totally cool.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.003
My mom knows him

07:01.087 --> 07:04.090
{\an1}and it's not
like it's going to be

07:04.173 --> 07:05.633
nighttime or anything.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.067
(<i> all laughing</i> )

Oh, no, it's my mom!

07:30.825 --> 07:31.909
DODIE:
Don't panic!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.786
{\an5}GINGER:
Everything back
where it was.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.371
Tubes closed,
caps on, quick!

07:35.454 --> 07:36.664
Oh, boy...

07:36.747 --> 07:38.708
{\an1}The mascara's going
to hit the fan!

07:38.791 --> 07:41.419
(<i> gulping...</i> )

07:41.502 --> 07:43.004
{\an1}Parent/teacher night,
Carl.

07:43.087 --> 07:46.007
{\an1}I get a bad report from Gordo
and you're going to...

07:46.090 --> 07:47.133
Don't worry, Mom.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.885
I got her charmed
this semester.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.052
Ask anyone.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.304
(<i> gulping</i> )

07:51.387 --> 07:52.471
Oh! It's true.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.181
What did I tell you
about standing

07:53.264 --> 07:54.640
in front
of the open fridge?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.437
Move over.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.154
(<i> all talking at once</i> )

08:08.237 --> 08:08.946
Ginger, that you?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.657
(<i> door creaks</i> )

08:11.741 --> 08:12.491
Huh.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.515
What have we... here?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.479
(<i> wheezing</i> )

08:41.562 --> 08:41.938
DODIE:
Are we safe?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.607
Too soon to tell.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.775
(<i> knock on door</i> )

08:45.858 --> 08:47.777
{\an5}LOIS:
Ginger?
Can I come in?

08:47.860 --> 08:48.694
Uh, sure, Mom.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.948
Hiya, girls.

08:52.031 --> 08:52.907
Have fun tonight?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.951
Uh-huh.

08:55.034 --> 08:55.743
Sorta.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.079
{\an1}I enjoyed myself
in the usual manner.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.413
Good.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.374
Doing what, specifically?

09:01.457 --> 09:04.043
Oh, you know,
Chinese checkers

09:04.126 --> 09:06.837
charades, ornate
paper folding...

09:06.921 --> 09:09.298
{\an1}The Japanese
call it origami.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.466
Do they?

09:10.549 --> 09:12.468
It's funny, you know.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.886
I thought
they called it

09:13.970 --> 09:15.721
tampering in your
mother's makeup

09:15.805 --> 09:18.182
when you know her
bathroom is off limits.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.642
Oop.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.770
Okay, Ginge, I'm waiting
for the excuse here

09:22.853 --> 09:24.438
and it better be good.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.071
{\an1}We're tired of
looking dorky, Ma.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.073
I mean, just once
I'd like to have

09:34.156 --> 09:35.574
a picture worth trading.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.995
Wouldn't you like a wallet-size
you could be proud of?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.497
{\an1}I'm proud of all the pictures
of you kids...

09:41.580 --> 09:44.667
except maybe that one of Carl
with the raisin up his nose.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.837
Mom, can't we bend the rules
a little, just this once?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.880
(<i> sighs</i> )

09:49.964 --> 09:51.674
Look, there are
a hundred reasons

09:51.757 --> 09:53.175
why girls your age
shouldn't wear makeup.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.428
What I really mean
to say is

09:55.511 --> 09:57.805
{\an5}you girls have
your whole lives
to grow up.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.098
Enjoy what you've got now.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.684
Enjoy being yourselves.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.184
{\an3}Okay.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.312
Sorry, Mrs. Foutley.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.659
It was a lamb, Carl...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.620
and Baa-baa was
his name-o.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.705
So if you don't want
anybody to find out

20:06.788 --> 20:09.416
lay off Blake Gripling.

20:09.499 --> 20:12.836
Ooh... you're good.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.213
{\an1}Gordon:
If there's anything I can do

20:15.297 --> 20:16.882
{\an1}I know a wonderful
obedience school

20:16.965 --> 20:19.801
{\an1}that worked miracles
with my Buttons...

20:19.885 --> 20:22.471
though she's a purebred.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.474
{\an1}So you're saying you
don't find Carl charming?

20:25.557 --> 20:25.974
Because he says...

20:26.058 --> 20:29.603
You poor, dear woman.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.607
Why do I listen to those two?

20:33.690 --> 20:36.610
Lois! How are you?

20:36.693 --> 20:37.402
Eh, I'm fine.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.571
But my son is another
story entirely.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.782
How's Ginger doing?

20:41.865 --> 20:44.159
Please tell me
she's a delight.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.577
(<i> laughs</i> )

20:45.661 --> 20:46.828
She is, don't worry.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.163
Oh, before I forget,
let me give you

20:48.246 --> 20:50.832
her school pictures
to take home.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.418
{\an1}Want to take
a little sneak peek?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.466
Ginger!

20:59.549 --> 21:01.718
{\an1}But, Mom,
it's <i> fakeup.</i>

21:01.802 --> 21:04.680
{\an1}I didn't really
break a rule.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.848
{\an1}You are grounded, Ginger,
indefinitely, period.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.392
But it wasn't real makeup.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.771
The foundation's made of gravy,
the blush is just cranberries...

21:12.854 --> 21:13.897
I don't care.

21:13.981 --> 21:14.690
It's all being
confiscated.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.775
Now go to your room.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.360
But, Mom...

21:18.443 --> 21:20.028
End of discussion.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.364
{\an1}Oh...

21:22.447 --> 21:24.032
(<i> bell dings</i> )

21:24.116 --> 21:27.494
Whoever heard of such a thing?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.079
Gravy foundation.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.043
Hmm... needs blush.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.964
(<i> rock music playing...</i> )

21:39.047 --> 21:40.882
You know what to do.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.050
Trust me.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.179
Nobody will ever see
this blanky again.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.725
I know it stings

21:49.808 --> 21:52.602
but you did the right
thing, Carl. Trust me.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.311
{\an3}Uh-huh.

21:53.395 --> 21:57.232
I... I just need
to be alone now.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.032
(<i> squeaks</i> )

22:05.115 --> 22:07.200
Stupid lamb...

22:07.284 --> 22:08.410
Oh...

22:08.493 --> 22:14.624
Eww... it doesn't look
anything like me... thankfully.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.251
It's better than mine.

22:16.334 --> 22:19.629
I look like
a ventriloquist's dummy.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.507
I don't even recognize
this hot mama.

22:22.591 --> 22:26.011
We were totally better off
just being ourselves.

22:26.094 --> 22:26.887
These look ridiculous.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.346
And I'm grounded.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.933
At least we got permission
for re-dos on makeup day.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.645
You mean no makeup day.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.104
Definitely.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.064
See you at lunch?

22:37.147 --> 22:39.608
Okay. Bring your appetite.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.944
Something tells me I'm going to
be brown-bagging our fakeup.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.531
