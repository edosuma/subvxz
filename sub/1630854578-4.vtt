WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.541
<i>Previouslyon</i> The Recruit:

00:07.625 --> 00:11.625
There's a murder suspect in jail.
She poses a threat to national security.

00:11.708 --> 00:13.250
I need you to throw the case out.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.833
My father was murdered.
That bitch killed my dad.

00:15.916 --> 00:19.208
The cops claim he was doing
criminal shit with her, but they're wrong.

00:19.291 --> 00:21.291
-You don't recognize me?
-No.

00:21.375 --> 00:25.041
I met you. At Cora's.
Just before you beat her half to death.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.250
What did he do to you?

00:26.333 --> 00:28.083
She beat his skull in at a truck stop.

00:28.708 --> 00:31.208
There are people at the agency
that I have dirt on.

00:31.291 --> 00:34.708
One of them tried to kill you
and you won't tell me what they look like.

00:35.583 --> 00:38.541
-He's Asian-American, about 5'10".
-Just want to confirm his first name.

00:38.625 --> 00:39.625
<i>Xander Goi.</i>

00:39.708 --> 00:41.000
Owen is losing it.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.500
Paranoid AF.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.833
-Would anyone at the agency kill me?
-Sure.

00:44.916 --> 00:46.875
I need you to give me
Selby Shaw's real name.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.875
Selby Shaw is a pseudonym
for Dawn Gilbane.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.541
I think you're here to investigate us.

00:51.625 --> 00:55.416
I came across a graymail connected
to a fucking operation that you ran!

00:55.500 --> 00:58.291
Working at the CIA is
a never-ending game of musical chairs.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.833
If you don't start playing,
you'll be in trouble.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.333
Badass.

01:26.416 --> 01:30.291
That's how I'd describe
this man's performance in Beirut. Badass.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.666
It really wasn't that big of a deal.

01:33.750 --> 01:37.250
It's some pretty latent misogyny
to send the two first-year dudes

01:37.333 --> 01:38.708
to bro-out in the Middle East,

01:38.791 --> 01:42.875
while the most qualified lawyer
on the hall is stuck redacting memos.

01:42.958 --> 01:46.166
-Trust me, you would've been miserable.
-That's not the point, okay?

01:46.250 --> 01:48.166
I want the challenge.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.125
Why do you think I'm here?

01:50.208 --> 01:53.333
It's not to spend my day
watching Janus mainline Tums.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.833
She all right? Seems a little jealous.

01:57.333 --> 02:01.125
Jealous of what? We went on one
case together. It doesn't make us buds.

02:02.791 --> 02:04.208
Hey. Hey.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.750
-I heard you're a lawyer at the OGC.
-You heard right. What--?

02:08.833 --> 02:11.666
-What did you just give me?
-It's an incident report from OTS.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.583
Office of Technical Services.

02:14.458 --> 02:17.166
We built
an AI intelligence-gathering device.

02:17.250 --> 02:19.166
-It went a little...
-A little what?

02:19.250 --> 02:21.666
It's all in there, okay? Just read it.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.333
No, I don't want to!

02:50.291 --> 02:51.291
Sir?

02:51.708 --> 02:54.000
Oh, you have company. I'll come back.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.333
-No, come in. Close the door.
-Sure.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.666
-You remember Dawn Gilbane?
-Owen.

03:02.916 --> 03:03.875
Fuck!

03:04.708 --> 03:06.041
Nice to see you again.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.541
Yeah, hi. Yemen. Dawn.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.125
You look different.

03:14.875 --> 03:17.000
Is that your big-ass truck
in the parking lot?

03:17.083 --> 03:18.875
It gets like half a mile to the gallon.

03:18.958 --> 03:22.500
But I figure someone's gonna detonate
a nuke in Saudi Arabia

03:22.583 --> 03:25.458
in the next 18 months
and we'll all be riding bicycles. So...

03:25.541 --> 03:27.625
Why not enjoy the ride till then?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.291
Is that based on actual intelligence?

03:30.375 --> 03:32.875
I was just telling Dawn
how you moved Max Meladze's case

03:32.958 --> 03:34.666
from state to federal jurisdiction.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.166
Yes, and I spoke to the Attorney General.
I'm getting him to drop federal charges.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.833
-That's no good.
-She's right.

03:39.916 --> 03:40.750
Why not?

03:40.833 --> 03:43.583
Because that has CIA intervention
written all over it.

03:43.666 --> 03:46.791
And Dawn has requested that
Meladze's release be clean.

03:46.875 --> 03:47.708
Why?

03:47.791 --> 03:51.375
Operations wants to insert her back into
the Russian mob in Belarus as an asset.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.708
So the woman that's holding us hostage

03:53.791 --> 03:57.958
and threatening to expose our secrets
and the identities of CIA assets,

03:58.041 --> 04:00.250
we want her to come back and work for us?

04:00.333 --> 04:03.833
Yeah. After you left Yemen,
I started thinking about Meladze.

04:03.916 --> 04:06.916
She was rumored to be a rock star,
so I did a little digging.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.416
Turns out she was close
to General Kuznetsov,

04:09.500 --> 04:13.000
who just got moved into
the number two slot inside the FSB.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.291
Putting Meladze back into the field
as an asset

04:15.375 --> 04:18.708
would give us direct access
into Russian intelligence.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.791
The Deputy Director
is counting on me to get that done.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.791
But Meladze would have to be
fully vetted and papered this time.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.083
No more hip-pockets or soft files.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.375
The old General Counsel might not
have cared about the rules, but I do.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.500
Understood, sir.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.000
I'll coordinate with Hendricks
every step of the way.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.750
Make sure we're always five-by-five.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.666
Uh, does Max even want
to be an asset again?

04:39.875 --> 04:43.375
-Who gives a shit what Max wants?
-Get the AG to stand down.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.958
Figure out a different way
to free Meladze,

04:46.041 --> 04:48.125
one that doesn't look like
someone helped her.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.291
-Yes, sir.
-I'll get my team set up.

04:50.375 --> 04:54.166
Freeing Meladze from prison is only the
first step in returning her to Belarus.

04:54.708 --> 04:58.666
Can I get a space here at OGC
so I can better coordinate with Hendricks?

04:58.750 --> 05:01.166
-Sure. Whatever you need.
-Thank you, sir.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.833
-Looking forward to working together.
-Me too.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.041
Um...

05:10.708 --> 05:11.875
What?

05:13.125 --> 05:16.583
I received some documents
this morning unexpectedly.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.000
-Unexpectedly?
-Yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.041
Owen.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.250
I'm general counsel to the CIA.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.916
I have a Wikipedia page
with a photograph of my face.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.791
I keep my car windows up, my doors locked,
and my dinner reservations under Bieber.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.041
Do you know why?

05:32.583 --> 05:33.750
Memos.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.000
Subpoenas. Paperwork, Owen.

05:36.625 --> 05:40.208
Fuckers like to slip us paperwork
because they know once we look at it,

05:40.291 --> 05:41.625
we can't pretend we didn't.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.916
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.208
-Where'd you get that folder?
-A guy from OTS handed it to me.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.208
Sweet Jesus.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.000
-At first look--
-You looked at it?

05:51.208 --> 05:53.833
-Would you rather me not say what's in it?
-Did I say that?

05:55.500 --> 05:57.583
If I were to use the words
"torture robot"--

05:57.666 --> 05:58.708
-Get out.
-Right.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.208
And give that shit-storm-in-a-teacup
to Kitchens.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.000
Your priority is the graymail case.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.916
Sir, if I may just suggest
Violet Ebner for this.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.708
She's really smart, and with her military
background she'll just nail this.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.750
She's hungry for a challenge.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.000
Fine.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.916
Leave the folder on my desk.
I'll talk to her.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.416
What are you doing in here?

07:00.041 --> 07:01.291
Looking for Owen.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.333
-We're working on something.
-His graymail case?

07:04.416 --> 07:05.708
I can't say.

07:06.166 --> 07:10.916
Nyland asked us to set up shop in OGC.
Is there an empty office nearby?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.666
No. Sorry. You're from Operations?

07:13.750 --> 07:15.291
Is it that obvious?

07:15.375 --> 07:18.208
Well, the adrenaline junkies
in the hall gave you away.

07:19.666 --> 07:23.041
You really shouldn't go into
people's offices without permission.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.333
Of course.

07:24.416 --> 07:28.291
I was just leaving him a note,
but I will catch up to him later.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.375
Nice to meet you.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.583
Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General?

07:49.666 --> 07:52.333
You need to learn
that when I say I'll do a thing, I do it.

07:52.416 --> 07:55.083
But your thing's complicated.
There's an eyewitness.

07:55.166 --> 07:58.000
-So back off and let me handle it.
-There's an eyewitness? Really?

07:58.083 --> 07:59.791
-Did I stutter?
-No, sir.

07:59.875 --> 08:03.083
It's just, we've decided
to go a different direction.

08:03.166 --> 08:06.125
Circumstances have changed.
We don't need your assistance anymore.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.166
-But thank you.
-Thank me?

08:08.250 --> 08:13.041
Son, you just committed a cardinal sin.
You wasted my time, and I won't forget it.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.916
Next time you need a favor
from the Justice Department,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.875
punch yourself in the face instead.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.083
-Yes, sir.
-Fuck.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.208
Thank you, sir.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.666
You don't happen to know
the name of the witness?

08:31.416 --> 08:34.541
-Can I help you?
-This'll work. We'll set up in here.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.541
I don't-- This is my office.

08:38.125 --> 08:41.791
Not anymore. You got two minutes
to pack your stuff. Move.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.416
Why the fuck did you say
nice things about me to Nyland?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.333
-I was--
-You recommended me for an AI case.

09:04.416 --> 09:06.333
No lawyer wants an AI case.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.791
It's an entire horror film genre
for a reason,

09:08.875 --> 09:11.458
but you knew that,
which is why you sabotaged me with it.

09:11.541 --> 09:13.625
But you made a mistake.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.250
You said you wanted a challenge.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.458
-I'm just trying to help you. Wait--
-Whoa, hey!

09:20.208 --> 09:21.458
-Hi.
-What was that about?

09:21.541 --> 09:24.041
Making new friends. Special skill of mine.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.333
Like the friend you made with the AG.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.500
-How do you already know that?
-I do Pilates with one of his aides.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.625
Really?

09:30.708 --> 09:33.166
I had to tell him
we don't need his help anymore.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.958
-Right after he told me there's a witness.
-Mm.

09:36.041 --> 09:39.125
Actually, I could totally use your advice
on how to handle that.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.500
Shit.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.875
My Senate hearing got moved up to Monday.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.125
-Uh...
-Um...

09:46.833 --> 09:48.291
Smoot subpoenaed me.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.583
He wants me to testify about
the classification protocols

09:50.666 --> 09:52.583
at the Office of the General Counsel.

09:52.666 --> 09:54.000
To give him dirt on Nyland.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.416
Yes, how does everybody know
that's what subpoena means?

09:56.500 --> 09:57.750
You're a little fucked.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.291
The senator could get access
to all your work product.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.875
Thank you. I know.

10:02.625 --> 10:04.875
-Have you told Nyland?
-No. He's got enough to worry abo--

10:04.958 --> 10:08.375
-Oh. Sorry. It's locked.
-Yeah, no shit.

10:08.458 --> 10:11.291
You had a visitor earlier.
From Operations.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.250
-Dawn Gilbane?
-I didn't get her name.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.416
-I'm not your secretary.
-She was in here? Did she touch anything?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.875
I doubt it. I came in right after her.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.500
-Is she a problem?
-What? No.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.458
I mean... no.

10:27.458 --> 10:30.208
Okay. You know, you owe me a date.

10:31.541 --> 10:34.666
You are totally right. I do.
How's tonight, 8:00?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.458
I promise, I won't make plans
with anyone else.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.500
-Perfect.
-We talk about my thing.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.791
Yeah. We'll do more than talk about it.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.250
I'll open the door now or people
might think we're fooling around.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.250
Really? That'd be immature.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.208
Good. All right.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.375
I asked if we could meet outside

11:07.458 --> 11:10.125
because I figured you'd appreciate
extra outdoor time.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.916
-It's lovely.
-Mm-hm.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.833
-So, I have some good news.
-You got me out.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.708
Uh, no. Actually, that got a little bit
more complicated, but I will.

11:21.791 --> 11:25.916
When I do, the CIA's putting you back
in to Belarus as an asset.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.500
Officially, this time.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.958
-Who decided this?
-Operations.

11:30.041 --> 11:34.166
Apparently, your graymail reminded them
how good of an asset you used to be, so...

11:34.250 --> 11:37.458
-Good job.
-Who? Specifically.

11:37.541 --> 11:40.208
Yeah. You know
I'm not going to tell you that.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.625
Dumb <i>suka.</i>
I shouldn't have sent the eclairs.

11:44.916 --> 11:49.125
-What-- Is that supposed to be code?
-It was him, right? Xander Goi?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.500
No. How do you know Xander's name?

11:53.583 --> 11:56.125
I told you I was gonna find out
who you met in Vienna--

11:56.208 --> 11:59.625
No! You told me all you needed
to know was his cover identity.

12:01.458 --> 12:06.375
I'm trying to help you and you're making
it harder by going behind my back.

12:08.708 --> 12:11.375
-You spoke to Xander Goi?
-I reached out.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.833
Did you threaten him?

12:14.375 --> 12:18.750
Mm. Maybe it would have come across
as a little hostile.

12:19.875 --> 12:23.291
Now what? You think he's behind
Operations showing up this morning?

12:23.375 --> 12:24.583
-Of course.
-Why?

12:24.666 --> 12:28.000
How is giving you your old life back,
sending you home, a form of payback?

12:28.083 --> 12:30.416
It's not. Unless that plan is a lie.

12:30.500 --> 12:35.041
You think it's because it's easier to
kill you once you're outside of the U.S.

12:35.958 --> 12:39.500
I know a lot of bad things
about many people, Owen,

12:39.583 --> 12:40.916
including Xander Goi.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.833
Sure.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.916
But according to Operations,
the CIA needs you back in country.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.333
Apparently you were buddy-buddy with
a general who's a top dog at the FSB.

12:50.416 --> 12:52.916
They say that you're more valuable
to us now than ever.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.125
Both things can be true.
They need me, they want to kill me.

12:56.208 --> 13:00.166
In which case, you'll have to prove to us
that you're worth more alive than dead.

13:01.416 --> 13:04.333
Why did getting me out
become more complicated?

13:04.416 --> 13:06.375
Because putting you back in as an asset

13:06.458 --> 13:09.541
means I can't have the Attorney General
make your case disappear.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.416
Also...

13:13.958 --> 13:15.083
Also what?

13:15.625 --> 13:19.125
The prosecution has an eyewitness
who saw you murder Kwitny.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.125
-A witness?
-Yeah. You got sloppy.

13:22.208 --> 13:26.625
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
I let my emotions get the better of me.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.166
It won't happen again.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.291
Who was this witness?

13:32.166 --> 13:33.000
I don't know.

13:34.291 --> 13:38.125
But I'm working on getting the name so
I can figure out how to keep them quiet.

13:38.875 --> 13:43.875
-People are most quiet when they're dead.
-No. You're not killing the witness, Max.

13:43.958 --> 13:46.750
I will fix this.
Don't go behind my back again.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.833
Don't do anything.
I need you to promise me.

13:48.916 --> 13:51.000
-I promise.
-No, I need you to mean it.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.958
I need you to trust me. Can you do that?

14:01.625 --> 14:05.375
-It was an unfortunate incident.
-An unfortunate incident?

14:05.458 --> 14:08.666
-An employee got his arm ripped off.
-Yes, it's clearly horrible.

14:08.750 --> 14:12.083
But the OTS is on
the cutting edge of spycraft technology.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.291
-That comes with certain risks.
-Yeah.

14:14.375 --> 14:19.958
And how often do you reach out to the OGC
to ask whether these risks are legal?

14:20.041 --> 14:23.666
These projects are very sensitive
and very compartmentalized.

14:23.750 --> 14:27.250
Yeah, well,
I have eyes-only security clearance,

14:27.333 --> 14:30.041
but I'm not here to open the door
to any other horror shows.

14:30.125 --> 14:34.416
I'm just trying to prevent us
from ending up on trial at the Hague.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.083
-What?
-Here we are.

14:46.958 --> 14:50.333
This is TIM.
Our "Technological Interrogation Machine."

14:50.416 --> 14:53.666
He speaks a hundred languages
and has over a thousand voice modulations

14:53.750 --> 14:57.125
ranging from soothing to terrifying.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.291
-Why doesn't he have a face?
-TIM is still in the beta phase.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.416
We need to make sure he works
before we decide what he looks like.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.333
That is a lot of blood on the walls.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.083
Yes. Um...

15:09.583 --> 15:14.000
He was conducting a mock interrogation
when a catastrophic injury was inflicted.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.541
How exactly did that happen?

15:15.625 --> 15:19.291
TIM has been programmed with
a variety of CIA interrogation techniques.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.666
But he's also been given autonomous
decision-making capabilities,

15:22.750 --> 15:25.458
so he can choose which one he'll use
in a given moment.

15:25.541 --> 15:28.416
Oh, and one of those choices
is dismemberment?

15:29.500 --> 15:33.500
The agency is allowed a certain
degree of enhanced interrogation.

15:33.583 --> 15:38.000
The use of stress positions on arm joints,
for example, are acceptable.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.625
However, we overlooked
an important safeguard.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.791
TIM was essentially operating
as if he were dealing

15:45.875 --> 15:49.291
with another being of the same make
and model as himself.

15:49.375 --> 15:52.333
You forgot to tell him we weren't robots?

15:52.416 --> 15:54.416
It's more complicated than that.

15:55.958 --> 15:56.791
Yes.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.750
So this is what you describe
in your report as a system failure.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.750
That's kind of an understatement.
Don't you think?

16:01.833 --> 16:02.708
-Draft.
-What?

16:02.791 --> 16:05.541
That document that you received,
that you were snuck?

16:05.625 --> 16:08.625
-That was the first draft of my report.
-So where's the final report?

16:08.708 --> 16:12.166
I haven't filed it yet.
I held off once I knew you were coming.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Good.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.000
Good.

16:16.083 --> 16:16.958
Um...

16:17.666 --> 16:21.625
Don't do anything until I figure out
how to navigate this shit show.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.708
Legally.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.291
Uh...

16:24.875 --> 16:27.791
-What do I do with TIM?
-Nothing.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.958
You keep his creepy ass in there.

16:32.916 --> 16:33.791
<i>Hey, Cora.</i>

16:35.125 --> 16:37.916
Do you know anyone
with a cop on the payroll?

16:38.666 --> 16:39.833
Why?

16:39.916 --> 16:42.916
There's a witness in my case
and I want to find out their name.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.625
And you think we're friends now?

16:45.708 --> 16:48.208
I owe you for what you did to Salvatore?

16:48.291 --> 16:51.958
That's why I'm here.
So, yeah, I feel like a favor is owed.

16:53.541 --> 16:57.666
If you get caught trying to kill
a witness, they'll lock you up forever.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.375
I don't care.
I just want to get out of here.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.666
-Hello?
-<i>It's the vet.</i>

17:46.750 --> 17:48.833
<i>Your bird is ready to be picked up.</i>

17:49.458 --> 17:51.416
-Sorry?
<i>-The vet.</i>

17:51.500 --> 17:53.083
<i>Bird is ready for pickup.</i>

17:53.791 --> 17:56.666
Yeah, man,
I think you got the wrong number.

17:56.750 --> 18:00.458
<i>Are you new or something?</i>
<i>Call your office.</i>

18:03.541 --> 18:06.458
-Lester Kitchens.
-<i>Yeah. Hey, man, it's Owen.</i>

18:06.541 --> 18:08.750
I got a call from someone
claiming to be the vet,

18:08.833 --> 18:10.625
saying my bird is ready for pickup.

18:10.708 --> 18:11.875
So go pick it up.

18:12.416 --> 18:13.416
<i>Um...</i>

18:14.375 --> 18:17.833
Somebody sent you a flash cable
to the regional office in Phoenix.

18:17.916 --> 18:20.250
Something deemed too sensitive
to send over e-mail.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.291
Cool. I didn't know that we had
a satellite office in Phoenix.

18:23.375 --> 18:27.000
Every major U.S. city has
a satellite office. Don't expect too much.

18:27.083 --> 18:30.166
<i>These regional offices</i>
<i>are filled with C-list players</i>

18:30.250 --> 18:32.333
<i>that hate dealing with D.C. guys.</i>

18:32.416 --> 18:34.375
Real inferiority complex.

18:34.458 --> 18:35.666
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

18:50.791 --> 18:52.708
Hi. Owen Hendricks.

18:52.791 --> 18:55.333
I'm expecting an urgent
flash cable from Langley.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.208
Well, aren't you fancy.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.166
Can I have it?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.250
-There you go.
-Thank you.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.708
Thank you, Violet. Definitely worth
the 30-minute drive to get this.

19:19.791 --> 19:23.750
-You talking shit about our office?
-No, looks charming.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.000
I like the posters. You guys seem...

19:26.666 --> 19:27.916
so happy.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.541
-Did you see what it said?
-No.

19:36.625 --> 19:39.541
-"Infinite amount of dicks."
-No!

19:39.625 --> 19:41.541
Hi, guys, hi. Me again.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.541
Uh, sorry, I was being
a little cranky back then.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.375
Look, I could really use your help.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.416
-Yeah, right.
-No, I'm serious, man.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.541
I need to ID a witness
from a federal murder case.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.708
One that has deep
national security implications.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.166
I could get fired.

19:58.250 --> 20:02.166
I could get subpoenaed
for even mentioning this to you.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.625
A'Nyah Bell.

20:05.708 --> 20:08.750
She's prosecuting, so I can't ask her
to get the witness's name.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.375
I got to keep
the agency's fingerprints off of it.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.583
She wouldn't help even if you could ask.
She's too by-the-book.

20:14.666 --> 20:16.166
Phoenix PD?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.208
Okay. Look, I get your reluctance.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.791
You've been abandoned here.
Rejected on every single level.

20:22.875 --> 20:25.666
They call you losers at Langley.
Did you know that?

20:26.875 --> 20:28.875
But I don't see that. Not one bit.

20:28.958 --> 20:32.125
No, I see patriots that
have been wronged by the system.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.291
Tell me, what did you do to end up here?

20:34.375 --> 20:35.250
-Mm?
-Yeah.

20:37.291 --> 20:41.541
I confused Myanmar with Malaysia
during a covert op.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.375
There were, uh...

20:45.333 --> 20:46.416
casualties.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.625
That could happen to anyone.

20:52.541 --> 20:57.125
Look, I can't promise you that helping me
is gonna get you back into the show.

20:57.208 --> 21:01.291
I can't even promise that it'll get you
name brand soda for the fridge.

21:01.958 --> 21:07.416
But what I can promise you is that
helping me is helping your country.

21:08.416 --> 21:10.125
And I can tell that you guys are ready--

21:10.208 --> 21:15.208
No, more than ready,
to do something that matters again.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.833
I know a guy on the Phoenix PD
I can talk to on the DL.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.208
Thank you.

21:31.916 --> 21:35.791
-I don't wanna be single again.
-You won't be. It'll be fine.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.416
It better be. Dating scene in D.C.'s grim.

21:39.041 --> 21:39.958
What's gonna be fine?

21:41.125 --> 21:43.583
Terence and Tad are having the talk.

21:43.666 --> 21:47.458
The "Where is this going
'cause I'm ready to get serious" talk?

21:47.541 --> 21:49.500
-Hate those.
-We know.

21:49.583 --> 21:53.583
Hey, how long have
these hot dogs been in here for?

21:53.666 --> 21:57.291
Stop. There are burritos hidden in
an empty spinach box in the freezer.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.500
Get the fuck out.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.250
Score!

22:01.291 --> 22:02.500
Thank you.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.416
Hey, are you going to this?

22:07.625 --> 22:09.666
Yeah. I have to.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.125
My parents are on the board
of the Sea Life Society.

22:12.750 --> 22:16.041
-Do you have a date?
-I do not. No.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.791
-Jeff is working.
-At the White House?

22:18.875 --> 22:20.791
-He doesn't say it that much.
-Please.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.583
It's literally the end of every sentence.

22:22.666 --> 22:25.416
-"I was thinking about going to lunch--"
-At the White House?

22:25.500 --> 22:27.166
"I was thinking about wanking off--"

22:27.250 --> 22:29.375
-At the White House?
-Oh, my God.

22:29.458 --> 22:32.541
Okay, you are just jealous
because Jeff got me a necklace

22:32.625 --> 22:34.875
and Tad hasn't given you a single present.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.791
-Mean.
-Mm-hm.

22:36.875 --> 22:39.041
So you two-- You guys are getting serious?

22:40.500 --> 22:41.916
Well, yeah.

22:43.791 --> 22:47.250
If Captain White House can't go tonight,
can you take me instead?

22:47.333 --> 22:50.208
I gotta catch Senator Smoot
outside of his home turf,

22:50.291 --> 22:52.708
maybe even talk to him
about pulling the subpoena.

22:52.791 --> 22:56.583
Turns out testifying could expose
one of my more delicate cases.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.750
I don't think so.
I don't-- With my parents--

22:59.833 --> 23:00.708
They love me.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.333
They don't?

23:04.958 --> 23:07.500
Wow, you never told me that.

23:07.583 --> 23:09.041
I gotta get ready.

23:11.916 --> 23:13.541
By the time they told me,

23:13.625 --> 23:16.083
you were already sleeping
with Kathy Lindquist.

23:16.166 --> 23:17.500
I wasn't.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.791
I didn't.

23:18.875 --> 23:22.125
Is that why you broke up with me?
You thought I was sleeping with Kathy?

23:22.208 --> 23:25.791
Okay. We're not gonna revisit
that awesome time in our lives.

23:25.875 --> 23:29.250
I just don't think it's a good idea
for me to take you tonight.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.333
-All right, fine, whatever.

23:32.416 --> 23:35.041
I'll figure out some other way
to solve my problem.

23:41.916 --> 23:43.458
Do you promise to behave?

23:47.208 --> 23:50.208
See, you and I both know
that's a trick question,

23:50.291 --> 23:52.333
because behaving is not my strong suit.

23:52.416 --> 23:54.916
If I say yes so you say yes, I'd be lying.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.250
So, no, I don't promise to behave.

23:59.625 --> 24:02.208
But I promise to try.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.250
Fine. I'll take you.

24:06.333 --> 24:09.333
-Yes!
-But it's black tie.

24:09.416 --> 24:10.958
-Yeah.
-Do you have a tux?

24:11.041 --> 24:12.041
Of course.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.041
-Hey, Bubba.
-What do you want?

24:17.291 --> 24:18.750
To borrow your tux.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.416
You shouldn't have asked Hannah
to take you to that party.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.041
-Why not?
-You know why not.

24:24.541 --> 24:26.000
She's a good person.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.333
And don't mess with her
because she deserves to be happy.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.250
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

24:33.333 --> 24:36.000
And for the record,
you deserve to be happy too.

24:36.791 --> 24:40.500
If Tad doesn't jump at the opportunity
to move to the next level, I--

24:40.583 --> 24:41.958
He's an idiot.

24:46.458 --> 24:49.500
Look, I just want a ring, and...

24:50.833 --> 24:52.125
a family.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.375
-Is that wrong?
-Well, for me it would be.

24:56.916 --> 24:59.208
But... for you?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.250
Well, let's just say I'm old-fashioned.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.333
Can I borrow the tux?

25:15.208 --> 25:16.750
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.166
We should've gotten stoned first.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.500
That's the spirit.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.958
-Hannah, you came.
-Yeah, you told me I had to.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.375
Owen, I didn't know you'd be here.

25:44.458 --> 25:46.833
I was a last-minute replacement.
Biff couldn't make it.

25:46.916 --> 25:48.166
-Jeff.
-Jeff.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.500
-He was working.
-At the White House.

25:51.375 --> 25:54.666
How's your new job?
Some kind of government work, right?

25:54.750 --> 25:57.333
Yes, I'm slaughtering it
at the Marine Mammal Commission.

25:57.416 --> 26:00.250
Owen is a lawyer at the CIA.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.416
How fitting.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.125
Ooh. Really curious to know
what you meant by that.

26:05.208 --> 26:06.291
-No.
-No.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.666
-Let's go get a drink.
-Sure.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.000
-Bye.
-Take care.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.291
What can I get you?

26:15.166 --> 26:17.083
How about the Deep Sea Daiquiri?

26:17.750 --> 26:20.541
-What do you want?
-You got White Claw?

26:20.625 --> 26:22.250
-Don't get that.
-Seriously?

26:22.333 --> 26:24.500
It's a full bar, and it's all free.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.666
-How about a martini?
-How about a White Claw?

26:26.750 --> 26:28.000
Thank you.

26:29.833 --> 26:31.375
Okay. So, what's the plan?

26:32.125 --> 26:33.708
Find the senator, win him over.

26:33.791 --> 26:35.250
That's a bad plan.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.750
-Got a better one?
-One Deep Sea Daiquiri.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.083
One White Claw.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.541
-You want a glass?
-No.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.125
-Yes.
-Thank you.

26:45.375 --> 26:47.791
You were saying?
What should I do about the senator?

26:48.625 --> 26:51.541
Okay. So, you clearly don't belong here.

26:52.291 --> 26:55.458
-Ouch.
-No, it's a good thing. Trust me.

26:55.541 --> 26:59.000
I grew up with these people,
and they're constantly measuring worth.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.916
Their own and everyone else's.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.416
How does that help me?
My worth starts with a minus sign.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.125
Yeah, exactly.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.875
Which is why Smoot thinks you're a nobody
he can just bat around like a cat toy.

27:08.958 --> 27:10.000
Oh.

27:10.083 --> 27:13.416
So, what is he gonna think
when he sees you at an exclusive

27:13.500 --> 27:15.875
VIP fundraiser dressed like James Bond?

27:15.958 --> 27:17.500
Well, he's gonna be confused.

27:20.750 --> 27:23.416
But he'll have to re-evaluate
how much he can fuck with me,

27:23.500 --> 27:26.166
which might just be enough
to get him to pull the subpoena.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.875
Or delay the hearing until he realizes
how powerful your friends are.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.458
There he is.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.708
Okay.

27:37.583 --> 27:39.208
-So, for the next hour...
-Mm-hm.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.125
...we are going to talk to every VIP

27:42.208 --> 27:45.250
I even vaguely know
right in front of his face.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.708
-Oh, I love that.
-Mm-hm.

27:48.833 --> 27:49.791
That's evil.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.083
Let's do it.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.791
Hey. I didn't know you were back.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.000
I'm not.

28:03.041 --> 28:06.833
I'm a ghost.
Violet died in South Carolina.

28:06.916 --> 28:09.125
Poisoned by a torture memo.

28:09.875 --> 28:10.833
That bad?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.416
That bad.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.583
You know, rather than starting small

28:19.666 --> 28:25.250
and figuring out whether an A.I.
interrogation robot was even a good idea,

28:25.333 --> 28:29.541
they went ahead
and built a $100 million Terminator.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.541
That's typical CIA, but that's not on you.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.583
Oh, no.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.208
It is.

28:35.291 --> 28:39.583
Because my name
is going to be on that legal memo.

28:39.666 --> 28:42.791
So when this becomes a giant scandal...

28:43.750 --> 28:45.833
I'm gonna be the first scapegoat.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.541
So, what can I do to help?

28:52.875 --> 28:54.041
So I asked the little fella,

28:54.125 --> 28:56.666
"Can you make the dish
a little less spicy?

28:56.750 --> 28:59.458
For my <i>oyinbo</i> sensibilities, eh?"

28:59.541 --> 29:01.333
I'm from Connecticut, for God's sake.

29:03.583 --> 29:04.958
I think it's working.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.791
-Mm. And there was--
-Senator...

29:07.875 --> 29:09.500
So nice to see you again.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.416
You're Nyland's new kid.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.000
Owen Hendricks. Yes, sir.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.791
I believe you know the ambassador.

29:14.875 --> 29:17.875
Oh, yes. I voted against his confirmation.

29:18.625 --> 29:19.500
Excuse me.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.625
And this is my friend, Hannah.

29:22.708 --> 29:25.416
Copeland. I believe you know
my parents Neil and Mei.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.750
Uh, yes. They have been very generous

29:29.833 --> 29:31.958
to my campaign over the years.

29:32.041 --> 29:34.541
-How do you know Owen?
-Oh, he, uh...

29:35.250 --> 29:37.875
helped me out with a classification issue.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.458
And I was happy to do it.

29:40.250 --> 29:42.333
Oh, look. Justice Collins.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.333
He loves you.
We should probably go say hi.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.791
-Absolutely.
-It was so nice to meet you.

29:46.875 --> 29:47.875
You too.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.708
Have a great night.

30:00.125 --> 30:03.625
Who the hell is this Owen Hendricks kid?

30:05.125 --> 30:06.166
Well...

30:06.250 --> 30:08.500
he's clearly not a nobody.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.791
So find out how much of a somebody he is.

30:15.375 --> 30:16.833
<i>I guess I was wrong.</i>

30:17.333 --> 30:18.875
It's not the end of the world.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.625
I suppose we could hot potato this thing
over to Owen.

30:21.708 --> 30:22.916
Hold on.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.916
You find something?

30:25.458 --> 30:28.500
Uh, according to the Charter at the OTS,

30:28.583 --> 30:30.625
an incident report
isn't required to be filed

30:30.708 --> 30:32.791
until after a test is concluded.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.583
Guy got his arm ripped off.
The test is concluded, isn't it?

30:35.666 --> 30:38.625
Technically, the test began
the moment TIM was turned on,

30:38.708 --> 30:42.500
and isn't officially over
until after TIM is turned off.

30:49.791 --> 30:50.625
Hello?

30:50.708 --> 30:54.083
-<i>It's Violet Ebner from the OGC.</i>
-Oh, hi.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.083
Is it true the test is still underway?

30:56.166 --> 30:58.416
<i>Uh, I mean, technically, I guess.</i>

30:58.500 --> 30:59.583
No. No, no, no.

30:59.666 --> 31:01.125
There is no "I guess."

31:01.208 --> 31:03.708
Based on the scientific parameters
at the OTS,

31:03.791 --> 31:05.500
TIM's test is still underway?

31:05.583 --> 31:07.291
Yes. Until we shut him off.

31:07.791 --> 31:09.625
<i>-And what if you don't?</i>
-Don't what?

31:09.708 --> 31:10.625
<i>Shut him off.</i>

31:10.708 --> 31:13.791
If you never shut him off,
then the test won't end.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.500
I mean, I guess.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.625
<i>Yes.</i>

31:17.416 --> 31:19.833
-What about when the battery dies?
-Uh, right.

31:19.916 --> 31:21.708
When does he run out of juice?

31:21.791 --> 31:23.791
<i>Never. This is new technology.</i>

31:27.000 --> 31:28.666
<i>Here's what you're gonna do:</i>

31:28.750 --> 31:31.000
<i>Lock TIM in a closet.</i>

31:31.083 --> 31:31.916
For how long?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.791
Until I retire.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.500
You feel quite pleased with yourself,
don't you?

31:55.583 --> 31:57.583
Oh, I'm pleased with us, okay?

31:57.666 --> 32:00.500
But we're not out of the woods
until he pulls the subpoena.

32:01.291 --> 32:05.083
Remember when we were cramming
for the Constitutional Law exam?

32:05.166 --> 32:07.083
-Yeah.
-Half-crazed, no sleep.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.833
And you made us go out.

32:08.916 --> 32:11.958
-Snuck us into that kid's bar mitzvah.
-Oh, my God.

32:12.041 --> 32:12.916
How could I forget?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I danced with half the girls
at his Hebrew school.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.166
-That was so much fun.
-Mm-hm.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.750
Are we ever gonna
have fun like that again?

32:22.833 --> 32:24.666
We're having fun right now.

32:25.833 --> 32:29.250
Sometimes, I worry
all the good times are behind me.

32:29.333 --> 32:32.166
I'm trying so hard
to become a responsible adult,

32:32.250 --> 32:34.416
I feel like once I get there,

32:34.500 --> 32:37.375
I'll realize I didn't enjoy being young.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.625
Well, that's why you have me. Hey.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.000
Make sure you never grow up.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.583
Yeah, that's why I have you.

32:46.666 --> 32:49.208
A Peter Pan with a license to kill.

32:49.291 --> 32:51.833
I told you. I'm a lawyer.

32:51.916 --> 32:53.166
Not a spy.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.666
I got a name.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.291
Your witness is Danny Woodrow.

33:12.833 --> 33:16.875
He lives alone in a shitty little trailer
outside Flagstaff.

33:18.416 --> 33:19.666
That's perfect.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.083
<i>Spasiba.</i>

33:24.458 --> 33:25.958
All right.

33:26.041 --> 33:28.000
Oh. After you.

33:28.541 --> 33:32.125
I cannot believe you got
the Secretary of Defense to Dougie.

33:32.208 --> 33:34.500
He had it in him.
He's got some serious skill.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.541
I just hope that groin pull
wasn't serious.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.875
What do you say we pre-order some pizza

33:41.958 --> 33:44.583
and fire up some OG <i>iCarly</i>
when we get home?

33:44.666 --> 33:47.083
Oh, I mean, we could, maybe--

33:50.375 --> 33:51.916
That's sounds amazing.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.333
I just-- I actually...

33:54.000 --> 33:55.708
made plans for after.

33:56.958 --> 33:59.875
For later. Yeah-- It was a co-worker...

33:59.958 --> 34:02.416
promised to help me with a work problem.
You actually know her.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.125
Amelia. The woman that I went
to dinner with a few days ago.

34:07.291 --> 34:09.833
But you brought me to your thing,
so if that's not cool--

34:09.916 --> 34:13.083
Oh, my God, no.
Don't be crazy. More pizza for me.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.208
And Jeff might come over. You're good.

34:15.291 --> 34:17.208
-From the White House.

34:22.291 --> 34:23.583
Holy shit.

34:23.666 --> 34:27.625
Um, it worked.
Smoot pushed the hearing back two weeks.

34:27.708 --> 34:28.875
Wow, that's great.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.625
It would've been better
if he canceled the thing entirely, right?

34:31.708 --> 34:32.958
Owen, take the win.

34:34.416 --> 34:35.250
You're right.

34:37.625 --> 34:40.958
-I can give you a ride home.
-No, I'm gonna Uber. But...

34:41.500 --> 34:43.666
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Hannah, I...

34:53.625 --> 34:55.958
I hope you had a splashing good time.

34:57.833 --> 34:59.041
Here you are, folks.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.041
Thank you.

35:08.833 --> 35:09.791
Climb in.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.791
It's cute that you're scared,
but I just want to talk.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.333
-Were you following me? Why?
-Yeah.

35:28.041 --> 35:31.750
I'm a control freak, especially when
it comes to operational security.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.166
You're a wild card.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.166
And you didn't
inspire confidence in Yemen.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.833
So... I'm doing my due diligence.

35:37.916 --> 35:41.750
Gotta say, I never saw you as a guy
to attend a black tie thing like this.

35:41.833 --> 35:45.166
Which makes me nervous.
What else don't I know about you?

35:45.250 --> 35:47.500
You can relax, it wasn't my thing.
I came with a roommate.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.958
-The one you used to sleep with?
-Stay out of my file.

35:51.708 --> 35:53.500
-And my office.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.416
Tell me something.

35:59.708 --> 36:01.541
Why the fuck are you a lawyer?

36:02.416 --> 36:04.833
You got the background for Operations.

36:04.916 --> 36:06.291
Dead Army dad,

36:06.375 --> 36:08.291
overdeveloped sense of bravado,

36:08.375 --> 36:10.791
flexible moral compass. So...

36:10.875 --> 36:13.250
Why do you wanna be the guy
everybody hates at work,

36:13.333 --> 36:15.875
when you could be with the cool kids?

36:15.958 --> 36:17.958
Because I despise the cool kids.

36:19.083 --> 36:21.166
They were the ones
that beat the shit out of me

36:21.250 --> 36:23.083
at every new school I went to.

36:23.166 --> 36:25.000
I get your play. I really do.

36:25.583 --> 36:29.125
Having a lawyer looking over your shoulder
makes your job exponentially harder.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.208
And to that...

36:31.166 --> 36:32.333
I say, tough shit.

36:34.375 --> 36:35.416
Fair enough.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.541
-How's it going with the witness?
-Still trying to find a name.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.916
-And then what?
-And then I'll figure it out.

36:44.458 --> 36:45.791
Good talk. Get out.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.583
-You're late.

37:00.666 --> 37:03.125
-But you look good.
-Wow, well, thank you.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.750
-It's not mine.
-Obviously.

37:04.833 --> 37:07.333
-It cost a couple thousand.
-What? Fuck. Really?

37:08.375 --> 37:10.583
-I would've been more careful.

37:11.708 --> 37:14.083
You're right. You should take it off.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.666
-What, now?
-Yeah.

37:15.750 --> 37:16.791
I'll help you.

37:44.666 --> 37:46.416
-Hello.
-<i>I got the info you wanted.</i>

37:46.500 --> 37:49.875
The witness's name is
Daniel "Danny" Woodrow Jr., 32.

37:49.958 --> 37:52.333
Lives in a trailer park.
I'll send you the address.

37:52.416 --> 37:54.333
<i>He's unemployed</i>
<i>and three months late on the rent.</i>

37:54.416 --> 37:58.333
<i>Apparently, he's been offered witness</i>
<i>protection in exchange for his testimony.</i>

37:58.416 --> 37:59.666
-Shit.
<i>-It gets worse.</i>

37:59.750 --> 38:02.083
He's giving videotaped testimony
tomorrow afternoon,

38:02.166 --> 38:03.583
then WITSEC's relocating him.

38:03.666 --> 38:07.750
You telling me that I only have-- Wait.
--12 hours to figure this out?

38:07.833 --> 38:08.666
<i>Yep.</i>

38:11.041 --> 38:12.916
You're gonna put in
a good word for us, right?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.833
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

38:25.791 --> 38:27.166
That's a legal question

38:27.250 --> 38:29.666
that has profound
National Security repercussions.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.875
What are you doing?

38:32.958 --> 38:35.708
I told you, I practice
being a talking head every night.

38:36.583 --> 38:37.541
Right.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.875
Hey, can I pick your brain
about my latest graymail drama? Please?

38:43.666 --> 38:45.583
If you do it as Anderson Cooper.

38:48.416 --> 38:49.583
Okay.

38:57.791 --> 39:00.291
-Introduce the segment first.
-The segment, right.

39:02.291 --> 39:05.125
The graymail case of Max Meladze
took a turn

39:05.208 --> 39:08.000
when it was revealed that
there's an eyewitness to the murder.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.875
Joining us today
to discuss potential next legal steps

39:11.958 --> 39:13.500
is Amelia Salazar.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.500
A former attorney
at the Justice Department,

39:18.583 --> 39:19.666
and more recently,

39:19.750 --> 39:22.083
a lawyer at the General Counsel's Office
of the CIA.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.083
Ms. Salazar, what is your take?

39:25.166 --> 39:26.041
Mm.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.666
That's a tricky one, Anderson.

39:28.750 --> 39:31.250
While eyewitness testimony is unreliable,

39:31.333 --> 39:34.125
it's often very effective with a jury.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.791
And in a murder case like this,
the existence of an eyewitness

39:36.875 --> 39:39.625
makes it almost impossible
to have the case thrown out

39:39.708 --> 39:42.125
-on procedural grounds.
-Fuck. Really?

39:43.166 --> 39:46.583
I mean, that makes
the pathway forward quite difficult,

39:46.666 --> 39:47.958
to say the least.

39:48.041 --> 39:51.958
Um, as does the fact that the witness
is about to be put into WITSEC.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.083
Fun fact, Anderson:

39:54.166 --> 39:56.666
The CIA has their own version
of a protection program.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.750
-Wait, we do?
-You're breaking character.

39:58.833 --> 40:01.416
-We relocate witnesses?
-No.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.875
Retired assets.
But it's basically the same thing.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.750
New identity, new life, the works.

40:05.833 --> 40:08.291
What if I told the witness
I was putting him in WITSEC,

40:08.375 --> 40:11.000
but actually put him in the CIA
relocation program? Can I do that?

40:11.083 --> 40:12.125
Well...

40:12.541 --> 40:14.958
Technically, the General Counsel's Office

40:15.041 --> 40:17.791
has to clear each asset
before they go into the program.

40:17.875 --> 40:20.708
Meaning, if I tell them he's
a former asset, they won't question it?

40:20.791 --> 40:22.875
-Exactly.
-That's fucking awesome.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.750
You're welcome, Anderson.

40:24.833 --> 40:26.958
Always a pleasure to be on the show.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.791
Now let's go have sex again.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.083
<i>The destination is on your right.</i>

40:44.791 --> 40:45.875
Hello?

40:51.083 --> 40:52.250
Mr. Woodrow!

40:52.333 --> 40:53.791
Your door's open.

40:55.291 --> 40:57.083
Hello? Mr. Woodrow, are you home?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.541
-Mr. Woodrow--
-Whoa. What the--?

41:00.625 --> 41:04.416
Mr., Woodrow, I'm from the AUSA's office
I'm here to take your video testimony.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.916
-My name is Jeffrey McLaren.
-I don't know nothing about that.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.916
-My office was supposed to call you.
-They didn't.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.125
-I only talked to A'Nyah--
-A'Nyah Bell. Yes.

41:12.208 --> 41:15.041
She's actually the one that asked me
to come and take your testimony.

41:15.125 --> 41:18.083
I'm seeing her this afternoon
at the courthouse for my deposition.

41:18.166 --> 41:21.208
That was what your summons said, but...

41:21.291 --> 41:24.708
Mr. Woodrow, the threats against you
have escalated immensely,

41:24.791 --> 41:27.166
and we believe that
your life is in imminent danger.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.958
Shit. Really?

41:30.041 --> 41:32.791
Yes. So AUSA Bell asked me to come here,

41:32.875 --> 41:35.708
take your video testimony now
and get you right into WITSEC.

41:35.791 --> 41:37.166
You don't believe me?

41:37.250 --> 41:38.458
Call my office.

41:39.083 --> 41:41.000
Confirm what I'm saying, please.

41:46.416 --> 41:49.416
-What'd you say your name was again?
-Call me Jeff.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.166
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>U.S. Attorney's Office.</i>

41:52.250 --> 41:53.458
How can I help you?

41:57.791 --> 42:01.000
So... you said I was in danger.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.000
What?

42:03.166 --> 42:04.000
Yes.

42:04.083 --> 42:07.000
That's why we decided to do this here,
not at the courthouse.

42:07.083 --> 42:10.208
You'll give testimony, pack your bags,
then the Marshals will come and...

42:10.291 --> 42:12.416
...take you to your new home.

42:12.500 --> 42:16.083
Do you know where it'll be?
Or what name I'll get?

42:16.625 --> 42:20.333
Hope it's something macho
like Rutger or Hank.

42:20.416 --> 42:22.250
They don't give us that info.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.250
Part of the safety protocol.

42:25.041 --> 42:28.916
But they have to set me up with a job
and a place to live, right?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.833
I haven't had a steady gig in a while.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.750
I'd like something
I can make a career out of.

42:34.541 --> 42:36.500
Fast food work really takes it out of you.

42:36.583 --> 42:39.708
If you could just state your name
for the court.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.750
Daniel Woodrow Jr.

42:41.833 --> 42:46.458
And can you tell us what you saw
the night the victim was killed.

42:46.541 --> 42:50.500
There's a truck stop a few miles from here

42:50.583 --> 42:52.708
that I eat at on the regular.

42:52.791 --> 42:57.250
I walked through the truck line,
you know, where all the truckers sleep.

42:57.333 --> 43:00.708
And that's where I saw that guy
getting his ass beat.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.666
Was this the victim that you saw?

43:04.375 --> 43:05.916
Yep, that's him.

43:08.375 --> 43:11.666
Let the record show the witness
has identified Salvatore Kwitny.

43:14.083 --> 43:18.208
-I think someone might be outside--
-And can you describe the murder?

43:18.291 --> 43:20.666
They talked for a second, and...

43:21.333 --> 43:24.041
then she hit him with a pipe or something.

43:24.125 --> 43:26.041
Was this the woman that you saw?

43:27.041 --> 43:28.083
Yeah, that's her.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.375
She's pretty hot, huh?

43:34.125 --> 43:37.750
Let the record show the witness
has identified Maxine Meladze.

43:42.041 --> 43:43.583
Do you mind if I go outside and check--?

43:43.666 --> 43:46.541
If you could just sit down,
we're almost done.

43:47.916 --> 43:50.666
What happened after she hit him?

43:50.750 --> 43:54.791
They fought. I thought he was gonna
kick her ass, but she was brutal.

43:54.875 --> 43:57.583
Started beating his head in

43:57.666 --> 44:01.000
and hitting him over and over
and over again.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.250
<i>Till she hit his brains.</i>

44:05.833 --> 44:06.791
Uh...

44:07.958 --> 44:10.000
Okay. Well, thank you very--

44:11.500 --> 44:14.166
Okay. Get down! Get down!

44:15.083 --> 44:16.333
Get behind something.

44:23.541 --> 44:25.875
He's reloading! Get to the door! Come on.

44:25.958 --> 44:27.791
-Okay! Okay!
-We gotta block the door!

44:29.166 --> 44:32.458
No, not lock, block!
It's-- Tip the fridge over!

44:36.708 --> 44:37.708
Okay, okay.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.666
-Fuck off!

44:46.291 --> 44:48.083
Okay. Okay. Do you have a gun?

44:48.166 --> 44:50.250
-No, I don't believe in them.
-What?

44:50.333 --> 44:53.000
-I found the one pacifist in Arizona?
-Sorry!

44:54.708 --> 44:57.125
-He's going in the bedroom.
-Give me that.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.375
Come here. Okay. Okay.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.166
-Danny! Get the gun!
-Jeff!

45:19.666 --> 45:20.500
Shit!

45:49.750 --> 45:50.833
Mr. Woodrow?

45:53.125 --> 45:55.875
Fuck. Come on. We gotta go.

45:55.958 --> 45:57.791
Come on, Mr. Woodrow, wake up.

45:57.875 --> 45:59.208
Wake up, Mr. Woodrow.

46:03.916 --> 46:06.166
Shit. Come on!

46:09.583 --> 46:10.708
Oh, shit.

46:23.958 --> 46:24.791
<i>Hello?</i>

46:24.875 --> 46:27.708
-You hired a hitman to kill the witness?
<i>-No.</i>

46:28.250 --> 46:29.291
<i>Maybe I did.</i>

46:30.000 --> 46:32.500
I'm gonna die
because you did not trust me!

46:32.583 --> 46:35.583
<i>I don't think now is the best time</i>
<i>to be having this conversation.</i>

46:35.666 --> 46:37.500
-Tell him to stop!
<i>-I can't.</i>

46:37.583 --> 46:39.000
What? You hired him!

46:39.083 --> 46:42.083
<i>He was sent through an intermediary.</i>
<i>He has no idea who I am.</i>

46:42.166 --> 46:43.791
<i>You'll have to fight your way out of this.</i>

46:43.875 --> 46:45.208
He's a giant!

46:45.291 --> 46:46.458
With a knife!

46:46.541 --> 46:49.000
And I'm in a double wide bathroom
with nothing but toiletries!

46:49.083 --> 46:51.625
<i>You can make a bomb</i>
<i>out of a lot of household products.</i>

46:51.708 --> 46:54.458
No, I don't have bomb-making time, Max!

46:54.541 --> 46:55.791
<i>Show me the bathroom.</i>

46:57.000 --> 47:01.375
<i>Okay. So your best bet is to blind him</i>
<i>and take that knife</i>

47:01.458 --> 47:02.916
<i>and shove it up his ass.</i>

47:12.875 --> 47:14.750
What the fuck is happening?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.791
Oh, shit.

47:28.791 --> 47:29.625
Fuck!

47:39.750 --> 47:42.833
Come on. Get in the car. It's over here.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.291
Fuck, I'm trying to unlock it!

47:48.375 --> 47:50.125
Gotta go. Come on!

47:50.208 --> 47:51.750
Go, go, go!

47:52.916 --> 47:54.708
-Go, go, go!
-Okay. Oh, no, no.

47:54.791 --> 47:58.291
We're good, we're good, we're good.
We're good. We're good.

48:00.458 --> 48:01.416
Shit.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.791
We're good, we're good! Wait. Shit.

48:03.875 --> 48:05.625
He got the gun! Get down!

48:05.708 --> 48:07.625
-Get down! Down!
-Oh, fuck.

48:13.416 --> 48:15.458
Do you think he forgot about us?

48:19.416 --> 48:20.833
The case is being dismissed.

48:20.916 --> 48:22.250
Lack of evidence.

48:22.333 --> 48:25.125
Our squeaky wheel
should be released by tonight, sir.

48:25.208 --> 48:26.416
I'm impressed.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.791
<i>Good job.</i>

48:27.875 --> 48:28.791
Thank you, sir.

48:29.750 --> 48:30.708
<i>So, what's next?</i>

48:39.041 --> 48:41.208
-Um...
<i>-Are you there?</i>

48:43.208 --> 48:44.041
<i>Owen?</i>

48:45.541 --> 48:48.333
Yes, sir. I'm still here.
What was the question?

48:48.416 --> 48:50.375
What's the next step?

48:56.208 --> 48:57.833
There he is. My hero.

48:57.916 --> 48:59.291
You're dead to me.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.333
-Don't be like that.
-I said I'd fix it.

49:02.416 --> 49:04.666
I begged you not to do anything.

49:04.750 --> 49:06.583
And you hired a fucking hitman.

49:06.666 --> 49:09.125
When people say they'll do things,
they usually don't.

49:09.208 --> 49:10.375
-I did.
-I know.

49:10.458 --> 49:12.958
You did, and I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.166
No, it's too late. I'm done.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.875
-We are done.
-Don't be so dramatic.

49:17.958 --> 49:21.583
Come, there were bumps along the way,
sure, but we both benefited.

49:21.666 --> 49:22.583
Benefited?

49:24.708 --> 49:26.583
Max, I hurt someone by helping you.

49:26.666 --> 49:29.875
Someone who doesn't deserve
the betrayal that she's feeling right now.

49:29.958 --> 49:32.208
And what, you think that's my fault?

49:32.291 --> 49:34.958
That I turned you into a bad person?

49:36.166 --> 49:41.458
Owen, trust me,
I have manipulated many good people

49:41.541 --> 49:43.875
into doing truly terrible things.

49:43.958 --> 49:46.416
And it has always taken time.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.666
I've known you a week.

49:51.541 --> 49:52.708
You do the math.

49:54.791 --> 49:57.000
You are Operation's problem now.

49:57.791 --> 49:59.875
They'll pick you up from prison
when you're released.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.375
-Have a nice life.
-Oh, stop.

50:01.458 --> 50:03.625
-You still need me.
-No. I don't.

50:03.708 --> 50:06.000
You think the minefield has gone away?

50:06.791 --> 50:09.166
No one else will help you navigate it.

50:09.250 --> 50:11.875
No one else knows
what you're going through--

50:11.958 --> 50:13.041
No one else...

50:14.000 --> 50:15.916
is gonna destroy my life.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.625
Are you sure about that?

50:21.458 --> 50:22.416
Good luck.

50:30.416 --> 50:31.458
<i>What's up?</i>

50:31.541 --> 50:34.208
Nothing much.
I just finished work. Driving around.

50:35.083 --> 50:36.666
Wanted to hear your voice.

50:37.625 --> 50:38.625
<i>What's wrong?</i>

50:39.791 --> 50:40.625
Nothing.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
<i>Liar.</i>

50:45.208 --> 50:46.833
I just-- I don't know.

50:48.041 --> 50:51.458
I guess traveling around
has got me feeling kind of lost.

50:51.541 --> 50:52.916
Well, we're right here.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.625
So come home
and you won't feel lost anymore.

50:55.708 --> 50:57.416
Yeah, you make it sound so simple.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.958
<i>Yeah, because it is.</i>

51:00.041 --> 51:02.708
I'm gonna put you on speaker
so Terence can say hi.

51:08.041 --> 51:08.958
<i>Hey.</i>

51:09.041 --> 51:10.125
Hi. Uh...

51:10.666 --> 51:12.041
I broke up with Tad.

51:12.125 --> 51:13.416
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, man.</i>

51:15.458 --> 51:16.833
<i>He doesn't deserve you.</i>

51:17.500 --> 51:18.875
I know. I...

51:19.750 --> 51:20.875
But I really liked him.

51:20.958 --> 51:24.625
Don't worry.
You're gonna find someone so much better.

51:24.708 --> 51:27.083
Someone you'll fall head over heels for.

51:27.166 --> 51:28.125
Right, Owen?

51:29.208 --> 51:30.166
<i>Owen?</i>

51:31.750 --> 51:33.041
Am I a bad person?

51:39.500 --> 51:41.541
So that's why you're calling.

51:41.625 --> 51:44.416
Not to check on Terence or me,

51:44.500 --> 51:46.208
but because you did something

51:46.291 --> 51:48.500
<i>and you know I'll make you</i>
<i>feel better about yourself.</i>

51:48.583 --> 51:50.375
Yeah. So the answer is yes.

51:50.458 --> 51:51.708
<i>The answer is...</i>

51:52.708 --> 51:54.000
<i>you're selfish.</i>

51:55.333 --> 51:57.833
<i>Do I think you have a good heart? Yeah.</i>

51:57.916 --> 52:01.166
But you get lost a lot.

52:02.333 --> 52:03.250
<i>Sorry.</i>

52:03.916 --> 52:04.750
Oh, God.

52:04.833 --> 52:07.375
Must be bad
if you're apologizing so easily.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.000
No. You're just right.

52:11.000 --> 52:11.916
I gotta go.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.541
Give Terence a big hug for me.
I'll see you at home.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.791
-Hello?
-<i>Hey.</i>

53:06.875 --> 53:07.708
It's me.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.416
<i>The asset is being released tonight.</i>

53:12.625 --> 53:14.875
Are you sure this is how
we should be playing it?

53:15.625 --> 53:19.083
<i>Yes. It's high-reward, low-risk.</i>

53:20.625 --> 53:22.875
<i>We're mission planning two options.</i>

53:22.958 --> 53:25.083
<i>One to put her back in country,</i>

53:25.166 --> 53:27.291
<i>the other to put her in the ground.</i>

53:28.291 --> 53:29.833
<i>What about the lawyer?</i>

53:29.916 --> 53:31.708
<i>What if she told him about us?</i>

53:34.250 --> 53:36.708
-Then we'll deal with it.
