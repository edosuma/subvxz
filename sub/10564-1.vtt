01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:39.882
So, what did you think
of the film?

01:21:39.882 --> 01:21:41.817
It weren't bad,
was it?

01:21:41.817 --> 01:21:43.886
It was easily better
than harry potter,

01:21:43.886 --> 01:21:46.655
which me thought
was very childish.

01:21:46.655 --> 01:21:50.626
If you is watchin' this,
potter, I's better than you.

01:21:50.626 --> 01:21:53.095
You probably ain't even
slept with a girl.

01:21:53.095 --> 01:21:55.798
I's slept with three.

01:21:55.798 --> 01:21:58.767
And I got one of 'em
to play with herself.

01:21:58.767 --> 01:22:00.869

you thought of this film,

01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:03.739

that it waswicked.

01:22:03.739 --> 01:22:05.608
