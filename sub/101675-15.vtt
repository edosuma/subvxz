00:05.222 --> 00:08.008
Herschel moved out.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.314
Oh, Brenda.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.707
I'm so sorry.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.362
I think I have a boyfriend.What's his name?

00:14.405 --> 00:16.451
Marcus Adam Larson.
He's 11 and a half,

00:16.494 --> 00:18.757
he has blond hair,
his favorite color's green

00:18.801 --> 00:20.237
and he's learning
how to skateboard.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.804
How do you know
he's your boyfriend?

00:21.847 --> 00:23.327
Because this happened.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.855
Well, I didn't realize
you had documentation.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.466
I know.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.079
ADULT SHELDON:
As long as humans
have been on Earth,

00:36.123 --> 00:37.950
they've had to contend
with viruses.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.996
And as long
as I've been on Earth,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.824
I've come up with fun ways
to avoid them.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.478
I've heard so much about you.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.828
Apparently not how I feel
about shaking hands.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.091
ADULT SHELDON:
I wear personal
protective equipment...

00:48.135 --> 00:49.614
You come here
right this instant.

00:49.658 --> 00:50.963
...and I was social distancing

00:51.007 --> 00:52.139
before it was cool.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.618
But in the early '90s,

00:53.662 --> 00:56.621
a new type of virus
became prevalent.

00:56.665 --> 00:59.929
One that no amount
of hand-washing could stop.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.194
A computer virus.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.022
Oh, no.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.676
ADULT SHELDON:
But let's back up
and begin this story

01:07.719 --> 01:10.070
in a simpler time,
before an insidious infection

01:10.113 --> 01:12.072
had upended my life.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
Hey, how has Billy
been lately?

01:15.771 --> 01:16.728
I don't know.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.208
Aren't you friends?

01:18.252 --> 01:21.298
We're like "head nod
in the hallway" friends.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.256
What's that?

01:22.299 --> 01:23.474
You see someone in the hallway,

01:23.518 --> 01:24.954
you give 'em one of these.

01:25.781 --> 01:26.912
SHELDON:
Ooh, there's
a computer game

01:26.956 --> 01:28.000
called Railroad Kingdom.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.437
Can we get it?

01:29.480 --> 01:30.438
How much is it?

01:30.481 --> 01:31.743
$49.95.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.050
Are you crazy?I'll handle this.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.791
I am not paying that much
for a game.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.967
It's not just a game.
It's a cutting-edge simulation

01:38.010 --> 01:39.490
teaching business skills

01:39.534 --> 01:41.927
in the golden age of railroads.It doesn't matter.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.364
But what if I end up
running a railroad one day

01:43.407 --> 01:45.192
and don't have
the necessary business skills?

01:45.235 --> 01:48.020
I think I nailed it
with, "Are you crazy?"

02:12.349 --> 02:15.961
Working extra hours,

Sure. You got a bulldozer?

02:23.317 --> 02:25.362
Maybe we just need
to get your mind off things.

Yes.

who sells bootleg games

enough money.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.487
So you're just getting it early.Hmm.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.707
I suppose an actual
railroad magnate

Thank you for
understanding, David.

I'm not usually a rule-breaker,
but it was Railroad Kingdom

12:27.268 --> 12:29.183
and I really wanted it
because I love trains.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.662
And it was $49.95.

12:30.706 --> 12:31.925
My mom said
it was too expensive.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.448
And I was
going to buy it eventually,

12:33.491 --> 12:34.841
and Tam said that
was good enough,

12:34.884 --> 12:36.494
so I got a bootleg copy,
and now I have a virus,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.453

So no one's gonna say anything
for the rest of the night?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.030

came up.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.815
I said something.That doesn't count.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.078
Missy, if you said
"I love you" to Marcus,

12:55.122 --> 12:58.168
and he said "samesies,"
would you be okay with that?Well...

12:58.212 --> 12:59.822
And before you answer,
remember who agreed

12:59.866 --> 13:01.128
to take you on a secret date.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.782
Don't ask her, she's a kid.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.001

and shared a straw!

Well, if you change your mind,
there's a gentleman

13:12.400 --> 13:13.618
over here at the bar
who would like us

13:13.662 --> 13:16.186
to see his butt crack.[laughs]

13:16.230 --> 13:20.930
So, then, was there no big
blowup when he left?

13:20.974 --> 13:22.105
Not really.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.629
Well, what happened?

13:24.673 --> 13:28.895
Let's see...
We used to be happy.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.288
Little by little, we weren't.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.463
Then there was bickering,

13:32.507 --> 13:36.685
then there was silence,
and then...

13:38.426 --> 13:39.862
...it was over.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.388
I mean...

13:44.432 --> 13:47.435
all couples bicker, right?

13:47.478 --> 13:50.003
You worried about
you and George?

13:52.570 --> 13:53.571
Of course.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.312
I'm sure you guys will be fine.

13:56.574 --> 13:59.055
And if it doesn'’t work out,
I'd be happy to introduce you

13:59.099 --> 14:01.623
to Butt Crack Bob over here.
[laughs]

14:08.021 --> 14:10.240
Well, I know it's rough,
but my old man left

14:10.284 --> 14:11.894
when I was around
your age. What are you,

14:11.938 --> 14:13.287
about 16, 17?

14:13.330 --> 14:14.810
I'm 12.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.681
Damn.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.335
You know, maybe he doesn't
want to talk about this.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.861
Sometimes it's good
to get stuff off your chest.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.471
My man's been
through a lot.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.169
And we're here for you.Thank you.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.258
I'm gonna raise.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.694
On the bright side,

14:29.738 --> 14:31.174
you could look after
your mom now.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.349
That's what I did.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.264
Made a man out of me.

14:34.308 --> 14:38.616
You know, Billy, sometimes
these things are for the best.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.270
Why would you say that?

14:40.314 --> 14:44.013
My parents had a bad marriage.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.449
Honestly, it...

14:45.493 --> 14:47.930
it was hard to be around.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.850
Full boat, read 'em and weep.
Come to papa.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.287
Sorry.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.377
Should we just
forget it and go home?

15:00.421 --> 15:01.465
Fine by me.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.163
Does the backseat get a vote?

15:03.206 --> 15:04.338
You put me on the spot.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.817
I never said that
to anyone before.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.908
Me neither,
and it didn't go well.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.518
Samesies.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.389
I'm sorry.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.478
I'm not even sure what
it's supposed to feel like.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.568
Well, if you felt it,
you'd know.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.615
I know that I like you.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.660
A lot.

15:23.661 --> 15:24.924
More than anybody else.

15:24.967 --> 15:25.968
Aw.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.102
Really?

15:29.145 --> 15:31.147
Yeah.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.412
By the way,
when Marcus is in the car,

15:35.456 --> 15:38.067
you can't be this lame.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.591
Okay, so what we're gonna
need to do is

15:40.635 --> 15:43.855
wipe your hard drive clean and
reinstall the operating system.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.553
What about all my files?

15:45.596 --> 15:46.946
Do you have everything
backed up?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.686
I back up my files
every Thursday night.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.427
I call it Backup Thursdays.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.908
It's not the catchiest,
but it sums up the situation.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.736
Perfect.
After we wipe your drive,

15:54.779 --> 15:55.955
you can restore it,
and you'll be

15:55.998 --> 15:57.957
good as new.Thank you so much.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.351
No problem. So, start
by turning the computer off

16:01.395 --> 16:02.831
and inserting the DOS disk.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.703
Wait, what if I used
the backup disk

16:05.747 --> 16:08.010
after the virus
was already on the computer?

16:08.054 --> 16:11.840
Oh. Uh, then I'm afraid
it's corrupted, too.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.669
But how do I get my files?

16:15.452 --> 16:16.714
You don't.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.152
But I have all my old papers
on there,

16:19.195 --> 16:20.240
my parents' taxes.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.807
I'm sorry.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.597
You ever play football?No, sir.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.600
Think about it. I will forge
a birth certificate tomorrow.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.559
Dad, something terrible
happened.What's the matter?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.735
I lost all the files
on my computer.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.868
Oh, well, I'm sure
you can get 'em back.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.565
I can't, and It's all my fault.

16:41.609 --> 16:42.914
All right, calm down.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.829
I can't calm down.
This is a disaster.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.744
It'll be okay, Sheldon.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.920
You don'’t understand.
They're gone.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.357
And they're gone forever.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.228
And no matter what I do,
they're never coming back,

16:52.272 --> 16:54.361
so it won't be okay.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.841
ADULT SHELDON:
I wish I could tell you

16:56.885 --> 16:59.061
I realized the cruel irony

16:59.105 --> 17:00.410
of what I had
just said to Billy,

17:00.454 --> 17:01.977
and apologized.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.286
But I didn't.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.729
ADULT SHELDON:
Like a virus,

17:14.772 --> 17:16.296
heartbreak can also spread.

17:20.648 --> 17:24.043
Once it does,
it's hard to contain.

17:28.525 --> 17:32.225
In some cases you can try
to reboot and start over.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.668
But it makes you appreciate
those early days,

17:40.711 --> 17:44.280
when your hard drive
was clean...

17:46.804 --> 17:50.199
...and the world
was full of possibility.
