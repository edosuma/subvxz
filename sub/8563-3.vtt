00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
January 1943,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
the survivors of the
battle of Gudalcanal

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
were taken to Melbourne, Australia.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Here, they would recover and
wait while the United States

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
built up its military forces.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
In spite of the
victory of Gudalcanal,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Japan still held the vast territory
surrounding its homeland.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It would take close to a year
to build the force large enough

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
to launch the next major American
offensive in the Pacific.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Meanwhile, when the marines
docked in Melbourne,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
news of their success
had preceded them.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We got to Melbourne

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and they were calling
us saviors of Australia.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You know what,
it was music to our ears.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
When we arrived in Melbourne,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
we had no idea what Australians
were supposed to be like,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
or what the country was
supposed to be like.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
All we knew is we had been
unloaded there in heaven.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You gotta keep in mind

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
that the Australian-New
Zealand army core.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
they were in Africa and...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
so, there was a shortage of men.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And all these gals hadn't had
any attention for a long time,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and we endeavor to do a good job.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I bet that was the best liberty *
** we had ever got.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It was perfect.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It was counseling on your mind

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
that this haven that we were
in was not gonna last forever.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You're still US and in the marine

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and you knew that there was
a war going on and we...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
knew that we would be into
it in a very short time.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Where we didn't know,
but we knew we were going.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We've been swallowed
by the jungle and

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
5,000 japs waiting to kill us.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- So the japs got us surrounded.
- Is that what's buggin' you?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Jap navy sails up and down this
slot every night and plasters us.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Bud...Bud, we gotta go.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Come on, bud! Come on!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Our battalion will join Hanneken's in
our old position south of the airfield.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They might pull Hanneken,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And that is gonna leave us alone,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
singled up on the line.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I got the whole fucking Jap
army headed your way, over.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Japs left, crawling in!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I'm putting you in
for a medal, John.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Sir, anybody bring in
Sergeant Rodriguez last night?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Get your gear and
stand by to stand by.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We're finally leaving
this shithole.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
So how bad was it?
Cause I heard it was bad.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
From who?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I mean before you got here,
have you ever even heard of this place?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Everybody's heard of Guadalcanal
and the 1st marine division.

00:00.000 --> 02:42.094
You're heroes back home.

Heroes! Heroes!

03:11.330 --> 03:14.332
<i>Welcome to australia, mates.</i>

03:16.501 --> 03:18.268
What the hell is this?

03:26.610 --> 03:29.544
Well done. Well done.

03:32.315 --> 03:34.848
Yay for the yankees.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.983
- Yay!
- Welcome down under.

03:37.018 --> 03:39.252
<i>G'day, handsome.</i>

03:43.324 --> 03:45.625
We love you.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.328
<i>G'day there, mate.</i>

03:52.533 --> 03:55.435
Do you believe this?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.370
<i>We love you!</i>

03:57.404 --> 04:00.640
<i>We love you!</i>

04:15.886 --> 04:17.987
How many japs you kill, yank?

04:18.107 --> 04:19.788
You kill many japs?

04:20.376 --> 04:22.860
<i>Killed any japs?</i>

04:32.215 --> 04:34.703
Let's go. Disembark the truck.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.937
<i>Find your company areas.</i>

04:38.972 --> 04:41.739
Where are we?

04:41.774 --> 04:44.275
<i>Keep moving.</i>

04:45.808 --> 04:47.877
<i>Make sure you got all your gear.</i>

04:49.046 --> 04:51.280
<i>Find your area.</i>

04:52.709 --> 04:55.644
<i>Keep moving all  the way through.</i>

05:00.213 --> 05:02.747
<i>Let's go. Find your areas.</i>

05:14.126 --> 05:17.427
<i>Make sure to store those
M1 rifles now!</i>

05:18.629 --> 05:21.164
<i>Andrews, you're on mess. Move it.</i>

05:21.198 --> 05:24.299
It ain't no wrigley field.

05:25.435 --> 05:27.169
<i>Man on p.A.:
Attention in the area.</i>

05:27.203 --> 05:29.237
<i>Attention in the area.</i>

05:29.272 --> 05:32.873
<i>All arriving personnel,
this is your billeting area.</i>

05:32.908 --> 05:35.209
<i>You will be directed
by your company.</i>

05:35.243 --> 05:38.178
<i>First squad, let's go.
Grab those packs.</i>

05:44.452 --> 05:47.288
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm gonna sleep for a few days.

05:50.824 --> 05:52.658
Better take a look at this.

05:53.826 --> 05:55.760
<i>The m.P.S are just giving up.</i>

05:55.794 --> 05:57.494
<i>Can they do that?</i>

05:57.528 --> 05:59.799
Everyone's going awol.
Nobody's stopping them.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.634
Oh, I've got to be a part of this.

06:01.668 --> 06:04.737
<i>- Marine: Whoo, freedom!
- All right.</i>

06:04.771 --> 06:07.539
<i>Melbourne here we come.</i>

06:07.573 --> 06:09.174
Let's hit the streets.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.809
Hey, buddy, rest up. All right?

06:11.843 --> 06:14.177
Mmm.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.155
I have something.

06:28.157 --> 06:30.691
It's like st. Mark's on woodward.

06:30.725 --> 06:33.161
All saints on north hermitage.

06:33.195 --> 06:36.763
It's as pure as every
church bell that ever rang.

06:43.037 --> 06:44.771
Straight ahead. Give it a try.

06:44.806 --> 06:46.772
<i>- It's wonderful.
- Sorry, excuse me.</i>

06:46.806 --> 06:49.374
The beers?

06:49.409 --> 06:53.008
Here, here and here.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.080
Whiskey,

06:58.114 --> 07:00.382
Gin,

07:00.416 --> 07:02.116
Rum,

07:02.151 --> 07:03.679
Vodka,

07:03.799 --> 07:05.350
Rye,

07:05.632 --> 07:08.388
Brandy, bourbon

07:08.422 --> 07:11.157
And vermouth.

07:12.236 --> 07:16.694
- And you call that...
- A blockbuster.

07:16.729 --> 07:19.430
You're sure gonna be
trouble tonight, cobber.

07:24.201 --> 07:27.303
- Here you go, manny.
- To manny.

07:39.581 --> 07:42.482
Never thought you'd
down that, mate.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.288
Right now we could down anything.

07:45.408 --> 07:47.616
Aren't you supposed to be
in africa fighting rommel?

07:47.736 --> 07:49.551
<i>Somebody has to keep the
peace at home,</i>

07:49.671 --> 07:52.290
Let you yanks get your proper r&r.

07:52.325 --> 07:55.106
Quite a lot of you here now.
Just arrived today?

07:55.144 --> 07:56.919
- Must be thousands.
- Tens of thousands.

07:57.039 --> 07:58.596
How many, mates?

07:58.630 --> 08:01.265
Enough for a cricket team.

08:01.299 --> 08:04.516
Enough to make our beer run
dry and our girls run loose.

08:04.636 --> 08:07.915
Have to fuck the king himself to find a
taxi you warriors haven't commandeered.

08:08.035 --> 08:10.574
I'd say it's a bit more
like a gang of roaches.

08:09.954 --> 08:13.043
Every step we take, and bloody hell,
there's another yank under our boot.

08:16.587 --> 08:20.290
I'm guessing this is one yank we
don't have to worry about anymore.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.259
<i>Hey, if it weren't for us
you'd be guzzling sake</i>

08:22.293 --> 08:24.828
With a pair of chopsticks up your ass,
you stupid fuck.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.866
Okay okay, that's it.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.035
Yeah right, you're all tommy
mix who saved the day.

08:35.038 --> 08:38.340
It's okay. Why don't
you get out of here?

08:38.374 --> 08:41.777
This one hits the turps,
first thing out he's having a blue.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.046
<i>Another dumb drunk who
thinks he can fight.</i>

08:45.081 --> 08:47.881
Let us buy you the
next round of drinks.

08:47.915 --> 08:50.616
<i>Otherwise what kind of
hosts would we be?</i>

08:50.651 --> 08:53.452
Alan, another round of
drinks for the cowboy yanks.

09:04.530 --> 09:06.532
Whoo!

09:06.566 --> 09:08.300
Oh, yank here.

09:08.335 --> 09:10.868
Looking to see the town.

09:12.871 --> 09:15.139
Oh, hello.

09:15.173 --> 09:17.208
Hello, beautiful.

09:17.242 --> 09:20.143
Visitor down under;
speak the same language.

09:27.017 --> 09:29.384
<i>Hey!</i>

09:35.023 --> 09:37.024
<i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

09:46.832 --> 09:49.167
Oh, what the hell's he doing?

09:49.201 --> 09:52.269
Where's that tram go? - That's the
preston line. He'll end up in perth.

09:52.303 --> 09:55.538
- Oh hey, leckie, come on!
- Hey, leckie, what the hell?

09:56.507 --> 09:58.407
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

09:58.441 --> 10:00.709
I apologize.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.979
Pardon me. Excuse me.

10:05.014 --> 10:08.416
- Excuse me.
- Hey, leckie!

10:08.450 --> 10:11.619
<i>Whoa!  Attaboy, leck. </i>

10:11.653 --> 10:14.021
Are you proposing already, yank?

10:14.055 --> 10:16.156
I'm proposing that you
take walk with me.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.224
You never know what
the future may bring.

10:18.258 --> 10:20.758
You know what take a walk means?

10:20.793 --> 10:23.193
Oh, ma'am.

10:23.228 --> 10:25.262
Ma'am, miss--

10:25.296 --> 10:28.532
Miss, I'm a foreigner
on your shores.

10:28.566 --> 10:30.934
Forgive my ignorance
of your customs, but...

10:35.506 --> 10:37.506
My invitation remains an offer.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.808
Ha.

10:43.178 --> 10:45.713
You're a bold one sotted.

10:45.748 --> 10:48.282
Let's see you in the light of day.

10:57.326 --> 11:00.361
Collect me at home.

11:00.396 --> 11:02.063
Being sober would be a plus.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.170
I'm stella, in case you were
wondering what to call me.

11:11.205 --> 11:13.005
Ah.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.906
Stella is it?

11:14.941 --> 11:18.175
<i>Well, you've got guts, leckie.</i>

11:18.209 --> 11:20.810
Thank you very much.
That made my night.

11:20.845 --> 11:23.079
- You'd better laminate that piece of paper.
- That made my night.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.524
- Gonna be good?
- I'll say.

11:36.558 --> 11:38.026
Shh, be quiet.

11:40.663 --> 11:43.397
<i>Hit it.</i>

12:27.430 --> 12:29.864
Company dismissed.

12:32.201 --> 12:33.934
<i>Let me tell you something,
sergeant,</i>

12:33.969 --> 12:36.937
Stumbling around camp
like the town stiff

12:36.971 --> 12:38.804
Is not acceptable behavior.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.839
Not anymore.

12:42.441 --> 12:45.912
Can't help but notice I'm
not alone in this, sir.

12:45.947 --> 12:49.449
Well, you are in one respect.

12:50.918 --> 12:55.255
You are about to be awarded
the medal of honor.

12:56.857 --> 12:59.626
President roosevelt
found you worthy.

13:01.895 --> 13:03.396
Congratulations, old man.

13:03.430 --> 13:06.632
You're about to go where very
few marines have ever been.

13:08.769 --> 13:11.137
Oh, hey hey! Here here.

13:11.171 --> 13:13.639
Oh, shit.

13:16.977 --> 13:19.311
This is-- I'm sorr

13:19.346 --> 13:22.514
Yeah, all right.

13:22.549 --> 13:24.782
Listen,

13:24.816 --> 13:27.116
Get yourself a big breakfast
and a pot of coffee

13:27.150 --> 13:29.419
And you come back here
when you're respectable.

13:29.453 --> 13:33.322
It's not gonna do to have you
heave all over your own citation.

13:35.158 --> 13:38.692
This is the highest honor that our
country can award a serviceman.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.994
But from now on,

13:41.028 --> 13:44.064
You try and act like it's yours.

13:44.099 --> 13:46.433
Yes, sir.

13:53.073 --> 13:54.640
Well, go.

14:03.983 --> 14:06.050
Aw, jeez.

14:06.084 --> 14:09.920
* you're just an
angel in disguise *

14:09.954 --> 14:13.956
* who wandered down from up above *

14:13.991 --> 14:18.360
<i>* you're just a heavenly
surprise *</i>

14:18.394 --> 14:21.729
* who came to earth
for me to love *

14:21.763 --> 14:24.965
* 'cause introduction to an angel *

14:25.000 --> 14:26.967
* is more than thrilling *

14:27.001 --> 14:29.402
* it leaves me high... *

14:29.436 --> 14:31.470
The articles of war?

14:31.505 --> 14:33.272
That's what I'm calling 'em.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.073
He's been going on about this

14:35.108 --> 14:37.408
Since long before you came along.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.778
See, gwenie's dad, my son,
he's over there in burma

14:40.812 --> 14:43.680
Showing the japs what side is up.

14:43.714 --> 14:46.382
I'm in charge of gwenie's honor.

14:46.417 --> 14:48.484
A manual of arms.

14:48.518 --> 14:51.019
My grandfather would want
the same understanding.

14:51.054 --> 14:53.554
Let's get this understood.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.523
Hit him with it, girl.

14:55.557 --> 14:57.758
Article I:

14:57.792 --> 15:00.494
General provisions.
Hands off the merchandise.

15:00.528 --> 15:01.728
You've memorized this?

15:01.763 --> 15:05.197
See, I'm the merchandise.

15:05.232 --> 15:07.099
Hand off, aye aye, sir.

15:07.134 --> 15:08.567
Article ii:

15:08.602 --> 15:10.369
Hands off the merchandise.

15:10.403 --> 15:12.937
Meaning there'll be none of that.

15:17.277 --> 15:20.446
There's no problem there.
I'm not much of a dancer, sir.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.385
Um, article iii:

15:26.420 --> 15:28.787
Punishments for
violating one and two.

15:28.822 --> 15:30.622
<i>It'll be swift and unflinching.</i>

15:30.656 --> 15:34.092
Don't for a moment
think otherwise, son.

15:34.126 --> 15:36.060
Yes, sir.

15:37.862 --> 15:39.861
Make a hole. Come on.

15:41.630 --> 15:44.597
Drink it out of the
glass without spilling.

15:44.631 --> 15:46.865
That's right. Take your time.

15:46.899 --> 15:49.965
Move closer. A little close.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.201
- Closer.
- Come on.

15:52.236 --> 15:55.072
Closer. Closer.

15:55.106 --> 15:57.276
A little closer.

15:57.311 --> 16:00.612
It's hard. Come on.

16:03.449 --> 16:05.682
M.P.S just pulled up.

16:05.716 --> 16:08.183
<i>You've got to get out of here.
Every marine in this place is awol.</i>

16:08.218 --> 16:10.618
I'd say that's why they're here.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.457
Listen up.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.291
Every marine in this establishment

16:18.325 --> 16:22.161
Will produce a liberty pass or will
return immediately to his billet.

16:22.195 --> 16:24.563
Oh, come on!

16:26.198 --> 16:28.733
What's this then?

16:28.768 --> 16:31.268
There's no problem.
I've got a pass.

16:31.302 --> 16:34.304
But still, why don't I escort
gwen out the back, sir?

16:34.339 --> 16:36.473
<i>- M.P.: You're going back to your billet.
- Good night, gramps.</i>

16:36.507 --> 16:39.676
<i>- Don't wait up.
- M.P.: Show me your pass.</i>

16:39.710 --> 16:42.945
Come on, let's go.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.782
Come on, mo.

16:52.356 --> 16:55.191
Saddle up, pardner. - Stealing an m.
P.'s jeep? Are you kidding me?

16:55.226 --> 16:57.626
- ( starts engine - come on, mo.  Hop in.
- ( starts engine - come on, mo.  Hop in.

16:59.796 --> 17:01.697
You can't do this shit,
john. Not now.

17:01.731 --> 17:03.566
Remember what chesty told you.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.935
Don't screw this up.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.847
Left.

17:20.882 --> 17:22.349
March.

17:24.153 --> 17:27.722
<i>Line halt.</i>

17:34.596 --> 17:37.064
Detail halt.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.367
Sir, detail is formed.

17:44.172 --> 17:48.008
For extraordinary heroism
and conspicuous gallantry,

17:48.042 --> 17:50.210
Sergeant john basilone,

17:50.245 --> 17:52.746
<i>While at great risk to
his own life,</i>

17:52.781 --> 17:55.249
<i>Fought valiantly to check a savage</i>

17:55.283 --> 17:57.417
<i>And determined japanese assault</i>

17:57.452 --> 18:00.653
While serving the 1st
battalion, 7th marines

18:00.688 --> 18:05.425
In guadalcanal on
October 24 and 25, 1942.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.728
<i>Sergeant john basilone
is hereby awarded</i>

18:08.763 --> 18:10.397
<i>The medal of honor.</i>

18:29.414 --> 18:32.415
<i>Left as we go.</i>

18:32.449 --> 18:35.985
Right face.

18:37.988 --> 18:40.957
Company right hut.

18:53.596 --> 18:55.764
Face right.

20:16.491 --> 20:18.626
So what's your name then?

20:18.660 --> 20:20.560
Bob.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.428
Sobered up, are you, bob?

20:22.463 --> 20:24.631
I'm no fool.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.400
These are for you.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.937
I hope you're hungry.

20:36.108 --> 20:38.743
<i>Man on radio:...Created
by the announcement</i>

20:38.777 --> 20:41.011
<i>That president roosevelt and
winston churchill</i>

20:41.045 --> 20:44.381
<i>Have met at casablanca
and completed...</i>

20:44.415 --> 20:47.083
<i>- Stella: This is bob.
- Leckie.</i>

20:47.117 --> 20:48.650
Bob leckie.

20:48.685 --> 20:50.619
Shake hands with my father baba.

20:50.653 --> 20:53.388
what a grip.

20:53.422 --> 20:55.857
An american grip, eh?

20:55.891 --> 20:57.659
This is my mama.

20:57.693 --> 21:00.294
This is a yank.

21:00.329 --> 21:04.264
Skin and bones.
Like a skeleton. Like a rail.

21:11.572 --> 21:13.806
Stella, his jacket. Ella.

21:17.978 --> 21:20.212
I thought we were
going for a stroll.

21:20.247 --> 21:22.681
Good news, bob.
You're staying for dinner.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.149
<i>I am?</i>

21:24.184 --> 21:27.519
One word of an american coming
to call and that was that.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.456
<i>This is like a thanksgiving.</i>

21:31.491 --> 21:33.191
Oh, what is that?

21:33.225 --> 21:35.893
It's a holiday roosevelt made of
the fourth Thursday of November.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.362
Everyone sits at the table,
eats turkey and argues.

21:38.396 --> 21:40.898
roosevelt is a great man.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.066
You eat as much as you like,
eh? Ella.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.102
The beans are from the garden.

21:45.136 --> 21:47.437
You didn't touch the feta.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.339
We save it for tomorrow, huh?

21:49.373 --> 21:51.741
Nay, mama, I'll start cleaning up.

21:51.776 --> 21:54.911
You see? Good girl, my stella.

21:54.945 --> 21:56.146
Good greek girl.

22:00.484 --> 22:02.284
You're on your own now.

22:02.319 --> 22:04.120
I think I can handle this one.

22:05.555 --> 22:07.289
So, mama,

22:07.324 --> 22:09.521
What's a greek girl like
you doing in melbourne?

22:09.556 --> 22:11.319
Oh, you don't care about that.

22:11.354 --> 22:13.653
No no no, don't go officer on me.
You're not australian.

22:13.688 --> 22:16.155
No no, I come from the old country.

22:16.189 --> 22:17.522
Smyrna.

22:17.556 --> 22:20.092
That was sacked by the turks,
wasn't it?

22:20.126 --> 22:21.995
You know about that?

22:22.029 --> 22:24.897
Um, I read a lot.

22:24.931 --> 22:28.432
<i>The turks invaded in 1922
and burned it down.</i>

22:28.466 --> 22:30.968
All gone.

22:31.002 --> 22:34.804
If you survived,
you fled like my mama and me.

22:34.838 --> 22:37.739
But we made it down to the docks.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.240
We swam to a ship.

22:40.274 --> 22:42.142
<i>The captain took us onboard</i>

22:42.177 --> 22:44.480
<i>And sailed us to piraeus.</i>

22:45.884 --> 22:47.619
He saved our lives.

22:47.653 --> 22:50.689
But our home was gone.

22:50.723 --> 22:53.224
So where do we go?

22:54.393 --> 22:56.060
We come here.

22:56.095 --> 22:59.464
We live, we work, we find love.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.801
So now you must tell
about your home.

23:03.836 --> 23:05.870
- Yeah, about america.
- No no no.

23:05.905 --> 23:08.474
Not america. America
we see in the movies.

23:08.508 --> 23:11.443
Your family. - Well,
seems like we both escaped disaster.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.911
I fled the leckie household.

23:12.945 --> 23:15.480
<i>How many in the household?</i>

23:15.514 --> 23:17.414
Mama had five girls, three boys.

23:17.449 --> 23:21.316
<i>Oh, okto babies. Your lucky mama.</i>

23:21.351 --> 23:24.786
I don't know if she'd agree.
She was almost 40 by the time I came along.

23:27.857 --> 23:29.557
She was worn out by then.

23:29.591 --> 23:31.592
I think they all were.

23:31.626 --> 23:35.262
But it's a blessing,
so many children.

23:35.296 --> 23:37.798
Well, marion and foddy leckie,
they didn't want eight kids.

23:37.832 --> 23:40.433
Oh no? They should stop?

23:40.467 --> 23:42.802
They didn't want the
beautiful baby son?

23:42.836 --> 23:46.571
I was last. Lasts least.

23:46.606 --> 23:49.174
<i>Oh, bob. You know nothing.</i>

23:50.176 --> 23:52.678
<i>By the time I met nicola</i>

23:52.712 --> 23:55.481
It was almost too
late to make babies.

23:55.515 --> 23:58.517
Not that we didn't try, eh?

23:59.785 --> 24:01.486
Eh, relax.

24:04.058 --> 24:06.830
That girl in the kitchen,
my only blessing.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.831
<i>I prayed for more,</i>

24:08.866 --> 24:11.000
But god said no.

24:11.035 --> 24:14.070
Nothing u can do when god say no.

24:15.806 --> 24:19.543
So where do you stay
with the marines, huh?

24:19.577 --> 24:21.745
They put us in the stadium
where you play cricket.

24:21.780 --> 24:24.916
What?  You will stay here tonight.

24:24.950 --> 24:28.350
Stella, get the bed ready
in the spare room. - Okay.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.384
I can't do that.

24:30.419 --> 24:32.186
I could never repay you.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.453
You can help clear the
vines from the roof.

24:34.487 --> 24:36.420
Yes, you will do that.

24:36.455 --> 24:39.989
You will make this your home.

24:46.295 --> 24:47.629
Twist a guy's arm.

26:39.844 --> 26:41.645
Oh, dear god.

26:44.949 --> 26:47.117
Oh, god.

26:49.454 --> 26:52.356
No no no, you stay right there.

26:52.390 --> 26:55.058
I think we should
give it another go.

26:56.260 --> 26:59.897
Okay, sure. Sure, me too.

27:00.866 --> 27:03.968
But even americans need, uh...

27:04.002 --> 27:07.404
Oh, a wait before they reload.

27:07.439 --> 27:09.607
It's okay.

27:10.842 --> 27:12.576
I'm going nowhere.

27:35.103 --> 27:37.571
Why did you have to
flee your family?

27:37.606 --> 27:40.141
Oh...

27:40.175 --> 27:42.743
My family.

27:44.512 --> 27:46.680
Not happy bunch, my family.

27:46.714 --> 27:48.615
Why not?

27:58.626 --> 28:00.994
<i>Something in our bones.</i>

28:02.697 --> 28:05.531
Did your brothers go into
the service to get away too?

28:05.566 --> 28:08.634
One of my brothers was too old.

28:08.668 --> 28:10.969
The other died when I was a kid.

28:11.004 --> 28:13.605
That's terrible.

28:13.639 --> 28:17.408
My father's been crippled
in the head ever since.

28:19.077 --> 28:21.212
We're not exactly the
judge hardy family.

28:22.981 --> 28:27.752
I swear, I'm just waiting for
the clock to hit midnight

28:27.786 --> 28:30.489
And my sanity bell goes ringing.

28:30.524 --> 28:33.993
I had a brother who died too.

28:34.028 --> 28:35.930
You did?

28:37.933 --> 28:39.768
No one talks about him.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.771
He was a baby, just a few
days old and didn't live.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.709
Mama got sick and wasn't
able to have any more.

29:59.608 --> 30:02.239
We start by restoring their bodies.

30:02.273 --> 30:04.974
They rest. They play.

30:05.008 --> 30:07.508
Then we work on their pride.

30:07.543 --> 30:09.543
We remind them they're marines.

30:09.578 --> 30:12.312
Then we replenish our supplies.

30:12.346 --> 30:14.580
See, all of that takes money.

30:14.614 --> 30:16.181
I understand.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.615
It's a hell of a lot
easier to raise money

30:18.649 --> 30:21.250
When there's a face behind it

30:21.284 --> 30:24.285
And a heroic story attached to it,

30:24.319 --> 30:25.919
Like yours.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.586
I don't feel like a hero, sir.

30:27.621 --> 30:29.687
You're not getting it.

30:29.721 --> 30:32.155
All right.

30:32.190 --> 30:35.191
Think of us out there on that line.

30:35.225 --> 30:37.092
You know what we need--

30:37.127 --> 30:40.354
New weapons, new gear,
better motor transport.

30:40.388 --> 30:41.786
Yes, sir.

30:41.821 --> 30:44.850
Selling u.S. War bonds

30:44.884 --> 30:49.580
Is just as important,
just as life saving,

30:49.614 --> 30:51.847
As what you did on guadalcanal.

30:51.881 --> 30:55.283
Now pack your seabag.
You're going home

30:55.317 --> 30:58.219
Home?

30:58.253 --> 31:01.121
How many u.S.
War bonds you gonna sell

31:01.155 --> 31:03.590
Stomping around the
solomons with us?

31:05.726 --> 31:08.527
Go on. Get it done, sergeant.

31:47.958 --> 31:49.526
Oh.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.561
I liked that.

31:51.596 --> 31:54.197
Shame on me.

31:56.066 --> 31:58.000
I got you something.

32:13.809 --> 32:16.077
Stockings?

32:16.111 --> 32:19.113
Real silk?

32:25.019 --> 32:27.554
I'll wear them only for you.

32:30.523 --> 32:32.257
Wait wait wait wait. There's more.

32:32.292 --> 32:34.559
This...

32:34.594 --> 32:36.627
Is for everyone.

32:36.662 --> 32:39.229
oh no.

32:39.264 --> 32:41.265
- Leg of lamb.
- No.

32:41.299 --> 32:43.500
How? How did you get it?

32:43.534 --> 32:45.635
<i>- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Why not?</i>

32:45.670 --> 32:48.071
I think you should
kiss me first. - How?

32:48.105 --> 32:49.806
- How?
- I can't remember.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.741
I can't get a leg of lamb.
But you do?

32:52.776 --> 32:55.978
American ingenuity and a
few packs of lucky strikes.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.781
"nicholas genkos-- wounded.

32:59.815 --> 33:02.316
Is that theodora genkos' nephew?

33:02.350 --> 33:05.584
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:05.618 --> 33:08.850
Baba checks the casualty
reports for greek names.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.555
"alexi stavrapolous."

33:14.589 --> 33:16.622
<i>What's happened to alexi?</i>

33:23.561 --> 33:24.928
"killed in action."

33:29.265 --> 33:31.599
I grew up with alexi.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.636
He lived two streets over.

33:37.339 --> 33:39.473
Change your shirt, nicola.

33:39.508 --> 33:42.176
We'll take them the spanikopita.

33:42.210 --> 33:45.046
I'd like to go.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.616
Pay my respects,
if they're friends of yours.

34:08.178 --> 34:10.679
- This is my friend bob.
- My condolences.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.419
<i>Stella and alexi,</i>

34:16.453 --> 34:18.922
They were friends every
since they were children.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.592
He was her friend.

35:01.792 --> 35:05.161
It's no good, bob.
Mama is still up.

35:34.326 --> 35:36.527
The greek boys are gone.

35:36.561 --> 35:39.163
<i>More and more every day--</i>

35:40.465 --> 35:43.834
<i>All of stella's friends from
when she grew up.</i>

35:43.868 --> 35:46.402
I prayed for them,

35:46.437 --> 35:48.871
And for their families.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.241
Do you go to church, bob?

35:54.543 --> 35:56.845
- St. Mary's.
- Mmm.

35:56.879 --> 35:58.747
What kind of church?

35:58.782 --> 36:00.716
Catholic.

36:02.819 --> 36:05.587
I like the early morning mass.

36:05.622 --> 36:06.989
Less people.

36:07.023 --> 36:09.560
<i>Hmm, we need prayers.</i>

36:10.863 --> 36:13.064
How are we going to make
it through these years

36:13.099 --> 36:15.333
If we don't pray?

36:17.970 --> 36:20.805
We are so lucky to
have you with us, bob,

36:20.839 --> 36:23.674
<i>To have a young man in the house.</i>

36:23.709 --> 36:25.843
<i>I like you.</i>

36:25.877 --> 36:29.280
Stella, she likes you.

36:29.314 --> 36:32.683
Baba, he always
wanted a son like you.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.389
I am going to pray that
you come back to us.

36:42.660 --> 36:46.129
That's a good thing to pray for.

37:15.727 --> 37:17.761
<i>Let's get your squads going!</i>

37:17.796 --> 37:20.898
<i>Pack up that gear anlet's go!</i>

37:22.834 --> 37:25.903
What?  You thought uncle sam was gonna
pay for your great debauch forever?

37:25.937 --> 37:28.405
<i>- Officer: Move out!
- Semper fi.</i>

37:28.440 --> 37:31.609
Better gear up, brother.

37:32.744 --> 37:35.179
Time to get back in shape.

37:47.225 --> 37:48.825
<i>The m1 is better.
Thers no contest.</i>

37:48.860 --> 37:50.761
<i>- Runner: Okay, so show us.
- Okay, ready ready.</i>

37:50.795 --> 37:52.862
oh!

37:52.897 --> 37:54.664
Eight rounds over five.

37:54.699 --> 37:56.866
No, I will still
keep my springfield.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.235
<i>Jesus christ, it's like
talking to an old lady.</i>

37:59.269 --> 38:00.736
Fine. You know what?
Keep your cane.

38:00.771 --> 38:02.138
- I will keep my cane.
- I'll will take the m1

38:02.172 --> 38:03.873
Because it beats the hell
out of the springfield.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.175
<i>No no no no. The 03's are
still more accurate.</i>

38:06.209 --> 38:08.377
<i>- Exactly exactly.
- No no, they're slower.</i>

38:08.412 --> 38:09.579
- Target in sight.
- Watch him miss.

38:09.613 --> 38:11.648
<i>- Do it!
- Come on, gibson.</i>

38:11.682 --> 38:13.884
Come on, gibson.

38:13.918 --> 38:15.518
bull's-eye!

38:15.553 --> 38:17.720
Hey!  Hey!

38:17.755 --> 38:20.456
What are you doing?

38:20.490 --> 38:22.458
You just shot some
poor farmer's cow!

38:22.492 --> 38:24.460
It was gonna be steak anyway.

38:24.494 --> 38:26.596
Not if it's a dairy cow, you idiot.

38:26.630 --> 38:29.099
good shot, gibson.

38:29.133 --> 38:31.335
What kind of morons
have you become?

38:31.369 --> 38:33.904
Did you see that?
I've never seen that.

38:37.473 --> 38:40.641
You will be given
one sack of raisins.

38:41.977 --> 38:45.212
You will be given one
sack of uncooked rice.

38:46.748 --> 38:50.718
A japanese soldier can live
on that for three weeks.

38:52.287 --> 38:54.355
You will March the 100 miles

38:54.389 --> 38:56.223
<i>Back to melbourne</i>

38:56.258 --> 38:59.193
<i>And be in the arms of your
aussie girlfriends</i>

38:59.227 --> 39:01.229
In three days.

39:02.731 --> 39:05.701
Fall in, column of two.
Standby to move out.

39:05.736 --> 39:08.204
<i>Let's go. Fall in.</i>

39:08.238 --> 39:11.040
<i>Move out!</i>

39:39.438 --> 39:42.538
<i>H-2-1, drop your cocks and
grab your socks.</i>

39:42.572 --> 39:44.372
Formation in 20 minutes.

39:44.407 --> 39:46.741
Come on, let's move.
On your feet, let's go.

39:46.776 --> 39:49.111
<i>Come on, shake it out.
Let's do it.</i>

39:49.145 --> 39:50.911
<i>On your feet. Let's move.</i>

39:54.613 --> 39:56.713
Fuck!

40:02.320 --> 40:03.453
God!

40:13.195 --> 40:15.796
You first.

40:32.812 --> 40:34.812
Mmm!

40:34.846 --> 40:37.047
Oh, sweet jesus, that feels good.

41:18.118 --> 41:20.554
- Couple of doors down.
- Just right up?

41:20.588 --> 41:21.755
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

41:21.790 --> 41:23.324
- Take this with you.
- No...

41:43.176 --> 41:45.310
You have to go away, bob.

41:48.347 --> 41:51.549
Please don't come here anymore.

41:51.583 --> 41:53.584
I told mama and baba already

41:53.619 --> 41:57.454
That you got your orders and you left.
You couldn't say goodbye.

41:57.488 --> 41:59.889
You lied?

41:59.924 --> 42:03.159
I'm fairly crazy about you, robert.

42:03.193 --> 42:04.760
<i>I think you know that.</i>

42:04.794 --> 42:08.230
I thought so, yeah.

42:08.264 --> 42:10.998
But...

42:11.033 --> 42:14.235
I don't want to have
a baby with you.

42:14.269 --> 42:16.103
Uh...

42:19.440 --> 42:21.308
Are you pregnant?

42:21.342 --> 42:23.210
- No.  No.
- You're not?

42:23.244 --> 42:26.346
Bob, you and I aren't
going to have a family.

42:28.082 --> 42:30.683
And we're not going to get married.

42:30.717 --> 42:33.552
And you are never coming
back to melbourne.

42:45.698 --> 42:48.634
You're dumping me because you
think I'm gonna get killed?

42:51.604 --> 42:54.205
Bob...

42:55.307 --> 42:58.642
If you don't come back to us,

42:58.677 --> 43:00.878
I don't just lose you,

43:00.912 --> 43:03.013
Mama does too.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.682
I can't do that to her
and I won't let you.

43:17.962 --> 43:19.896
She's lost so much already, bob.

43:21.631 --> 43:23.098
She's praying for you
to come back to us.

43:23.132 --> 43:25.597
She can save her breath.

44:14.067 --> 44:16.235
Leckie. Leckie, god love you.

44:16.269 --> 44:17.936
- Come here.
- Fuck off.

44:17.971 --> 44:20.405
No, seriously. I've got
to piss like terrible.

44:20.439 --> 44:22.006
You've got to cover for me, okay?

44:22.041 --> 44:24.008
I can't. Drunk as a skunk.

44:24.042 --> 44:25.776
One minute, that's
all I need. Come on.

44:25.810 --> 44:28.345
Come on. Thank you.

44:47.629 --> 44:49.096
Leckie, what are you doing?

44:56.170 --> 44:58.872
Manning this fucking post,
lieutenant.

44:58.907 --> 45:01.809
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm the fucking guard on guard duty.

45:01.843 --> 45:04.178
You pull a fucking
sidearm on an officer?

45:04.213 --> 45:06.781
Lieutenant, I went for a quick piss.
Leckie was just covering.

45:06.815 --> 45:08.682
- You fucking prick!
- Stand at attention.

45:08.717 --> 45:11.518
- Fuck you!
- I said stand at attention!

45:11.553 --> 45:13.454
And I said fuck you!

45:17.026 --> 45:20.493
<i>* don't sit under the apple tree *</i>

45:20.527 --> 45:23.428
* with anyone else but me *

45:23.462 --> 45:25.963
* with anyone else but me *

45:25.997 --> 45:28.332
* with anyone else but me *

45:28.366 --> 45:31.968
* no no no, don't sit
under the apple tree *

45:32.002 --> 45:34.603
<i>* with anyone else but me *</i>

45:34.638 --> 45:36.572
<i>* with anyone else but me *</i>

45:36.606 --> 45:40.843
<i>* till I come marching home. *</i>

45:48.050 --> 45:50.318
yay, ma.

45:50.352 --> 45:52.653
- Run, ma!
- Good hit, ma.

45:52.687 --> 45:55.054
Yes, auntie, that's a six.

45:55.089 --> 45:57.556
So I guess it's sort
of like baseball, huh?

45:57.590 --> 46:00.025
What happens in baseball?

46:01.394 --> 46:03.028
Well, in baseball,

46:03.062 --> 46:07.132
You hit a ball and
you run to a base.

46:07.166 --> 46:09.568
Then you run to the
next base if you can.

46:09.602 --> 46:11.203
<i>You keep going to the next base.</i>

46:11.237 --> 46:14.806
If you get to enough
bases you score a run.

46:14.841 --> 46:18.276
<i>Sounds like rounders.
We play that in school.</i>

46:18.311 --> 46:20.045
Looks like someone is
hunting for you, cobber.

46:20.079 --> 46:22.113
Hey, it's my turn.

46:22.147 --> 46:24.849
Shit.

46:26.718 --> 46:29.752
- Your unit?
- How company, 1st marines.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.720
Report to your c.O.
No later than 2400.

47:03.245 --> 47:06.213
I trust you marines got
your heads back together.

47:06.247 --> 47:09.749
I'm on orders from
2nd marine division.

47:09.783 --> 47:12.218
Lieutenant lebec has
got the platoon now,

47:12.252 --> 47:13.985
And I want him to
inherit a solid outfit

47:14.020 --> 47:16.788
So I volunteered you
for reassignment

47:16.822 --> 47:18.790
To the battalion
intelligence section

47:18.824 --> 47:20.791
You're booting us?

47:20.826 --> 47:22.727
Not you--

47:24.197 --> 47:26.167
<i>Leckie.</i>

47:39.186 --> 47:41.654
Fuck.

47:49.495 --> 47:51.629
So, a little light.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.867
Yeah.

49:43.579 --> 49:45.780
How about if an engine catches fire

49:45.814 --> 49:47.214
And you dump in the pacific?

49:47.248 --> 49:50.915
Swim around for days, weeks,
get strafeby jap zeroes.

49:50.950 --> 49:52.884
Finally the navy picks you up.

49:52.918 --> 49:55.786
Think about how many war
bonds you'd sell then.

49:55.820 --> 49:57.789
Probably give you another medal.

49:59.091 --> 50:00.291
You're gonna look up katie, right?

50:00.325 --> 50:01.993
First chance I get.

50:02.027 --> 50:05.262
I've been sending my poker
winnings home to her.

50:05.297 --> 50:07.631
Hey, 700 of that is mine.

50:07.666 --> 50:09.967
that's the good
thing about leaving--

50:10.001 --> 50:11.735
I won't lose anymore money to you.

50:14.706 --> 50:17.641
Wish you were coming with me.

50:27.083 --> 50:29.251
I think that's you.
