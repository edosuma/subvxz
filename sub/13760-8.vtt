00:02.937 --> 00:04.636
I need papers for me,
my friend, and her son

00:04.638 --> 00:07.106
as soon as possible.
New names and passports.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.774
-Need to get out of here.
-What are you talking about?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.142
I thought that you said
everything was okay.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.710
Everything is not okay.
We need to disappear.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.146
The Colombian shipment
is arriving in Texas today.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.483
(speaking Spanish)

00:17.485 --> 00:20.052
We're late with everyone.
No one has their shipments.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.520
People are wondering
if there's change coming.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.622
-Why?
-What the hell is going on

00:23.624 --> 00:25.691
up there?
You know how much this cost me?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.493
Someone knew the truck
was coming.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.128
EPIFANIO (over phone): When was
the last time you did a purge

00:29.130 --> 00:31.330
to see if anyone is talking
to the DEA?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.232
Maybe it's someone
on your side.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.334
Do I have to worry about you,
Teresa?

00:35.336 --> 00:36.335
No.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.139

Get down!

00:40.141 --> 00:41.740
-This is an act of war.
-If he finds out

00:41.742 --> 00:43.742
I was trying to buy coke
from the Colombians,

00:43.744 --> 00:45.077
we'd be at war
with him, too.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.245
How did it go?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.347
Good.
Did we go too far?

00:48.349 --> 00:50.983
No.
Keep going.

00:50.985 --> 00:54.319
Hey, James.
Those Florida people...

00:54.321 --> 00:57.823
You said they have
25 kilos to sell.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.258
We're gonna steal it.

01:09.070 --> 01:09.968
Get up.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.908
It's 4:00 in the morning.

01:15.910 --> 01:16.909
Move, come on.

01:18.946 --> 01:19.778
Where are we going?

01:22.216 --> 01:24.116

01:51.479 --> 01:53.479
Teresa,
I need you to do something.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.780
It's important.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.316
Today is a different kind
of business.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.319
Turning $2 1/2 million into 5...

02:00.321 --> 02:02.321
it's not an easy trick.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.557
You're gonna be taking
the same risks as everyone.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.894
So I supposed you have the right
to know what goes down...

02:08.896 --> 02:11.396
and how it goes down.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.066
Some guys are coming in
from Florida this morning.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.901
We're gonna meet them,

02:15.903 --> 02:18.637
and we're gonna rip 'em off.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.908
You have proven you can be
relied upon to do what I need.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.777
I don't know everything
about you.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.447
You only reveal
what you want.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.249
You're smart.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.651
Smart enough to understand
why I protected you

02:32.653 --> 02:34.620
and kept you alive

02:34.622 --> 02:38.657
and kept you a secret
from Epifanio, right?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.692
Why is that?

02:40.694 --> 02:43.162
I make him vulnerable.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.365
Because of what you saw
his men do to Chino.

02:46.367 --> 02:52.538
You understand you're only
leverage for me, right?

02:52.540 --> 02:56.441
But today,
we have to take a risk.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.977
If something happens to you,

02:58.979 --> 03:00.979
I lose my leverage.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.615
I understand that.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.618
But if we don't succeed today,

03:06.620 --> 03:08.487
I don't have anything left,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.556
and leverage means nothing.

03:10.558 --> 03:14.293
And with nothing,
I cannot protect you.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.197
So we all lose
if we fail.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.965
I know you're scared.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.468
Use that fear
to stay alive.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.637
After all,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.306
you're a survivor.

everything about your work.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.926
Everything about that hotel.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.129
I want to know
about the security cameras,

04:57.131 --> 04:59.131

04:59.133 --> 05:01.233
They reset the keys every day.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.535
We only get them

his father got for him,

07:12.232 --> 07:13.732
and now,
what are we sleeping in?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.600
Some sleeping bag
in some shitty ass motel.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.803
Oh, it's--
it's not that bad, yo.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.838
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have kids.

07:25.312 --> 07:29.247
No, my son is gonna have
a future.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.749

07:57.678 --> 07:59.678
I'm just saying,
I got options.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.482
Anyone can make

Using items that can be

08:08.121 --> 08:10.589
We're working today

08:10.591 --> 08:13.258
This is the stuff

08:13.260 --> 08:14.626
The goal of this process
is to extract

08:14.628 --> 08:17.262
the pure pseudoephedrine
from cold tablets.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.532
The tools we're using are crude

08:20.534 --> 08:22.601
Methyl alcohol
from gasoline additives,

08:22.603 --> 08:25.537
ether from spray cans,
and lithium from batteries.

08:25.539 --> 08:29.641
Ingredients for making meth
are legal, inexpensive,

08:35.983 --> 08:38.850
Ha. It's dissolving into
the ether layer, see that?

It's as easy as making cookies.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.220
You tell me.

Destroying my business.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.520
Making me go back to Mexico.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.823

12:04.825 --> 12:06.825

27:57.309 --> 27:59.209
