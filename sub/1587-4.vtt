18:29.520 --> 18:31.124
OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.247
No.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.282
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.285
I wasn't originally meant to
marry your grandfather Luthor.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.524
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.364
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.246
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.045
But the moment I saw my intended,

18:56.200 --> 18:58.965
with his twitchy little ferret's face

18:59.040 --> 19:02.249
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

19:03.120 --> 19:08.604
So the evening
before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

19:08.680 --> 19:11.490
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

19:11.560 --> 19:13.927
and happened upon his chamber.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.206
(LAUGHS)

19:15.320 --> 19:16.606
How absentminded of me.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.205
Mmm-hmm.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.682
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

19:21.760 --> 19:25.128
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.762
And once he could, the only thing he wanted

19:27.920 --> 19:30.082
was what I'd given him the night before.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.201
I was good.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.728
I was very good.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.321
You are even better.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.251
But you need to act quickly.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.242
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.369
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.523
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.125
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent

19:53.240 --> 19:54.685
is rather distracted at the moment.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.650
Mourning her dear departed boy.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.806
Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.361
He could have done.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.204
But he didn't.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.725
You don't know, Grandmother.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.251
But I do know.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.644
You don't think
I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.764
What? I don't understand.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.484
Shh.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.925
Don't you worry yourself about all that.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.366
You just do what needs to be done.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.801
Ever since that great cow
brought you back to the capital.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.006
Why did she set you free?

25:39.080 --> 25:41.890
You know why. She'd hoped
I'd send her daughters back to her.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.084
She hoped or did you promise?

25:49.160 --> 25:50.810
I swore by all the gods

25:50.880 --> 25:53.042
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.203
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.408
I wanted to get back to you.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.771
Should I have told her to fuck off?

26:01.560 --> 26:02.971
You didn't mean it, then?

26:03.080 --> 26:05.890
You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.684

He didn't do it, Cersei.

She's not safe out there.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.567
I should have known.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.563
You told us
there were wildlings south of the Wall.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.484
If they're raiding the smaller villages,
Mole's Town could be next.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.210

35:32.280 --> 35:33.725

to leave the castle.

and rode south to help Robb.

who came after me and brought me home.

I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.645
When you told me about
Bran going beyond the Wall,

35:50.720 --> 35:52.484
all I could think about was
getting my strength back

35:52.560 --> 35:53.925
so I could go and find him.

I wish I could have convinced him
to come back with me.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.080

36:10.560 --> 36:12.005

36:12.080 --> 36:14.845
They'd pass wildling villages.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.810
They could try and find
shelter at one of them.

There's 60 miles of wilderness

37:40.880 --> 37:44.168

bearing down on us,
