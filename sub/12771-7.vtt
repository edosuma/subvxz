00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:08.083 --> 00:10.041
(Jake) ADDISON?
SWEETHEART, OPEN THE DOOR.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.583
NO, I'M FINE. THANKS.

00:11.625 --> 00:13.166
OPEN THE DOOR
SO WE CAN TALK.

00:13.208 --> 00:14.583
OH.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.959
TALKING.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.041
TALKING IS SO OVERRATED.

00:18.083 --> 00:21.083
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.
THANKS. GO AWAY.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.375
WE CAN, UH, YOU KNOW,
TALK LATER.

00:23.417 --> 00:26.041
ADDISON, I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
YOU TO FEEL EMBARRASSED.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.041
NO, IT'S OKAY.
CLEARLY, I HAD IT COMING.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.041
I DID THE SAME THING TO SAM
WHEN HE PROPOSED TO ME,

00:30.083 --> 00:32.208
SO KARMICALLY, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, KARMA...

00:32.250 --> 00:35.041
(laughs) IS SO AWESOME.

00:35.083 --> 00:36.667
I-I DIDN'T SAY NO.

00:36.709 --> 00:39.041
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
WHICH IS... FINE.

00:39.083 --> 00:41.166
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.458
BECAUSE NOW I'M...

00:43.500 --> 00:44.834
LOCKED IN THE BATHROOM
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON,

00:44.875 --> 00:47.625
WHICH I'M SURE MAKES ME
SO ATTRACTIVE TO YOU.

00:47.667 --> 00:51.208
YOU WANT ME SO BADLY RIGHT NOW,
I'M BETTING. (chuckles)

00:51.250 --> 00:52.333
I LOVE YOU.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.792
I LOVE YOU--THE BRILLIANT,

00:54.834 --> 00:56.208
THE STUNNING, THE BITCHY,

00:56.250 --> 00:59.709
THE CRAZY IN THE MORNING,
IN THE AFTERNOON, 3:00 P.M.--

00:59.750 --> 01:01.583
OKAY, JUST STOP.
DON'T SAY ANYMORE.

01:01.625 --> 01:02.875
ALL RIGHT? 'CAUSE YOU SAY
THESE NICE THINGS,

01:02.917 --> 01:05.041
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU

01:05.083 --> 01:07.041
AND THAT JUST MAKES ME
WANT TO MARRY YOU MORE,

01:07.083 --> 01:09.041
WHICH ISN'T HELPING,
BECAUSE I JUST PROPOSED TO YOU,

01:09.083 --> 01:11.000
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY YES.

01:11.041 --> 01:14.041
OR NO. I-I DIDN'T SAY NO.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.709
BABY, JUST OPEN THE DOOR,
PLEASE.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.041
(latch clicks)

01:23.083 --> 01:24.500
I AM IN THIS. ALL RIGHT?

01:24.542 --> 01:27.083
NO QUESTIONS,
NO RESERVATIONS.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.041
DO YOU NOT WANT
TO GET MARRIED?
IT'S NOT THAT.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.917
IT'S JUST--
IT'S A BIG STEP.

01:30.959 --> 01:33.625
THE BIGGEST STEP. AND I...

01:33.667 --> 01:35.041
I WANT US TO BE READY.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.458
SO THAT'S A NO?

01:36.500 --> 01:38.875
IT'S NOT A NO.
IT'S JUST A...

01:38.917 --> 01:40.041
NOT RIGHT NOW.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.333
(sighs)

01:42.375 --> 01:44.208
YOU'RE GONNA LOCK YOURSELF
IN THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

01:44.250 --> 01:47.041
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT OUTSIDE HERE,

01:47.083 --> 01:48.709
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.750
RIGHT HERE. I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.000
(exhales deeply)

01:59.750 --> 02:01.500
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE.

02:07.709 --> 02:11.083
SO WHAT'S NEW?

02:11.125 --> 02:13.792
THAT WAS PRETTY BIG,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:13.834 --> 02:17.500
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
NOT WITH YOU.

02:17.542 --> 02:19.709
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.500
I MEAN, YOU'RE HERE,
IN OUR SPOT.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.583
YOU KNOW IF YOU COME,
I'LL SHOW UP.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.709
DON'T GIVE ME THE LOOK.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.542
I'M ONLY HERE
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO BE HERE.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.500
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE WE CAUGHT UP.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.750
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.125
I KNOW.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.208
IT'S GOOD.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.709
YOU'RE HAPPY.

02:38.750 --> 02:42.000
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

02:42.041 --> 02:45.125
I WANT YOU
TO FORGET ABOUT ME.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.333
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.709
(Addison)
SO HERE IS THE THING--

03:02.750 --> 03:07.041
I DIDN'T SAY NO.
I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT IT.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.083
WHAT DID I SAY?

03:08.125 --> 03:09.583
TO NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.792
TO NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.333
ADDISON--
NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.125
PLEASE, SWEETIE.
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.000
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.041
OKAY. SO WHAT'S THE THING?

03:20.083 --> 03:22.208
OH, MILDRED,
THE SOCIAL WORKER.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.792
I TOLD HER ABOUT
OUR STATUS CHANGE.

03:23.834 --> 03:24.792
WHAT?

03:24.834 --> 03:26.792
THE MOVE, THAT YOU MOVED IN.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.667
SO SHE NEEDS TO MEET WITH YOU
BEFORE THE HEARING,

03:29.709 --> 03:31.667
BECAUSE UNTIL HENRY IS
OFFICIALLY MINE,

03:31.709 --> 03:33.667
YOU KNOW, BY LAW, I HAVE
TO UPDATE HER EVERY TIME--

03:33.709 --> 03:36.250
A NEW GUY MOVES IN?

03:36.291 --> 03:37.375
OF COURSE I WILL MEET
WITH MILDRED.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.000
YEAH?
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

03:39.041 --> 03:41.417
HEY. I LOVE HENRY.
I LOVE YOU. I'M OKAY.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.625
ARE WE OKAY?

03:42.667 --> 03:45.166
ABSOLUTELY. YOU LOVE HENRY.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.792
YOU LOVE ME.

03:46.834 --> 03:48.875
I LOVE YOU.

03:48.917 --> 03:50.458
WE'RE GOOD.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.041
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
BEEN SLEEPING?

04:01.083 --> 04:02.917
NOT ME.

04:02.959 --> 04:06.458
NOT SINCE SARAH WENT MISSING.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.041
BUT DANA...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.000
THE PILLS HELP, I THINK.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.125
DANA?

04:16.583 --> 04:18.625
YEAH.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.500
THEY DO.

04:20.542 --> 04:23.667
THEY HELP ME.
AND WHEN I SLEEP,

04:23.709 --> 04:25.542
SARAH'S THERE, SMILING.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.709
SOMETIMES
I CAN EVEN HEAR HER.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.125
WELL, IT'S BEEN ABOUT
SIX WEEKS,

04:32.166 --> 04:34.667
AND I WONDER IF...

04:34.709 --> 04:37.667
PERHAPS WE SHOULD CONSIDER
WEANING YOU OFF THE PILLS.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.875
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.041
I'M WORRIED THAT SHE'S BECOMING
TOO DEPENDENT ON THEM.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.125
SO WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

04:43.166 --> 04:45.417
THIS MEDICATION
CAN BE ADDICTIVE.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.792
IT'S NOT MEANT
FOR LONG-TERM USE,

04:46.834 --> 04:49.000
AND I THINK IT'S HAVING
A-A NUMBING EFFECT ON DANA.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.959
THAT'S THE POINT.
YOU WANT HER TO FEEL THIS?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.667
SHE CAN'T FEEL THIS,

04:52.709 --> 04:54.542
BECAUSE I'M FEELING THIS,

04:54.583 --> 04:56.041
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,

04:56.083 --> 04:57.291
THAT IF ONE OF US DIDN'T NEED
TO BE CONSCIOUS,

04:57.333 --> 04:59.041
IF ONE OF US DIDN'T NEED
TO TALK TO THE COPS

04:59.083 --> 05:01.709
OR MAKE A PUBLIC PLEA,
IF WE COULD BOTH BE NUMB--

05:01.750 --> 05:03.041
I WOULD BE TAKING ANYTHING
TO NOT FEEL THIS.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.041
YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY HER PILLS.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.333
RON--
NO. NO. NO.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.750
SHE FALLS ASLEEP,
AND FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS,

05:08.792 --> 05:11.166
IT'S OKAY.

05:11.208 --> 05:15.166
BUT THEN SHE WAKES UP,
AND...

05:15.208 --> 05:18.709
THIS NIGHTMARE THAT WE'RE LIVING
IS BACK.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.041
SHE STARTS TO SCREAM

05:21.083 --> 05:23.792
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE OUR BABY IS.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.333
I CRY.

05:26.792 --> 05:30.667
WHEN I WAKE UP, IT HITS ME
AGAIN, AND I CRY.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.750
HE HOLDS ME.

05:37.542 --> 05:40.709
HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.291
HE'S THERE.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.583
SO YOU'RE LEANING
ON EACH OTHER.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.333
IN THE FACE OF THIS TRAGEDY,

05:48.375 --> 05:53.000
YOUR RECONCILIATION, IT...

05:53.041 --> 05:54.792
IT'S A POSITIVE.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.208
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE SURE?

06:01.250 --> 06:03.041
I'M SURE.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.750
WELL, MAYBE FIFTH TIME'S
THE CHARM.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.750
OH, IT'S EARLY YET,
BUT I'M CONFIDENT.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.750
JUST REMEMBER TO TAKE IT EASY
AND STAY CALM.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.625
THAT'S--THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.
AND YOU CALL ME

06:10.667 --> 06:12.166
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

06:12.208 --> 06:13.792
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO CALL DANNY.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.667
HE'S AT A CONFERENCE
IN HONG KONG,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.750
BUT HE'S GONNA BE
SO THRILLED.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.792
THANK YOU, DR. REILLY.
SURE.

06:19.834 --> 06:21.041
(elevator bell dings)

06:21.083 --> 06:23.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

06:23.083 --> 06:26.458
UH, MEGAN, YOU REMEMBER
DR. MONTGOMERY.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.625
OF COURSE.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.291
UM, YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
A GENIUS.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.583
MM.
I'M PREGNANT AGAIN.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.667
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:32.709 --> 06:34.792
THANKS AGAIN, DR. REILLY.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.542
SURE.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.792
NOW LISTEN,
I-I DID TELL MEGAN

06:40.834 --> 06:42.834
THAT IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.000
AHEM.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.667
I DID, BUT SHE BEGGED ME

06:46.709 --> 06:49.583
TO TRY AT LEAST ONE MORE TIME,
SO...

06:49.625 --> 06:50.792
ADDISON.

06:50.834 --> 06:52.875
MM?
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.041
WE AGREED TO DISAGREE.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.041
YOUR PATIENT...

06:56.083 --> 06:57.458
YOUR PRACTICE,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.208
YOUR PREROGATIVE.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.875
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

07:01.917 --> 07:03.542
(elevator bell dings)

07:03.583 --> 07:06.709
(indistinct conversations)

07:10.083 --> 07:12.500
AH.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.750
DR. SHEPHERD.

07:16.792 --> 07:17.875
DR. PETERSON.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.458
SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN ME.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.709
OH. THAT'S YOURS?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.208
I FORGOT MY ORANGE SODA.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.667
YOU CAN ONLY GET IT IN
THE VENDING MACHINE UP ON FOUR.

07:25.709 --> 07:28.625
(indistinct conversations
continue)

07:28.667 --> 07:30.834
BUSY DAY?
ABOUT NORMAL.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.041
ME? I HAD 12 PATIENTS--

07:33.083 --> 07:35.041
ALL EMERGENT,
ALL WITHIN A HALF-HOUR.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.500
IT WAS CRAZY.

07:36.542 --> 07:38.667
REMINDED ME OF WHEN I USED TO
WAIT TABLES BACK IN THE DAY.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.875
MM.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.041
(timer dings)

07:42.083 --> 07:44.041
THIS IS NICE.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.542
WHAT IS?
YOU AND I
HAVING LUNCH TOGETHER.

07:46.583 --> 07:47.875
NOT TOGETHER.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.500
YOU ARE EATING LUNCH.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.959
I'M EATING LUNCH. WE HAPPEN TO
BE DOING THAT AT THE SAME TABLE,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.333
SO, YOU KNOW, NOT A DATE.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.291
OF COURSE IT'S NOT A DATE.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.166
IF IT WERE,
YOU'D BE ENJOYING YOURSELF.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.083
WE'D BE HAVING
A PICNIC ON THE BEACH--

08:00.125 --> 08:01.291
I DON'T LIKE SAND IN MY FOOD.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.000
WHICH IS WHY THE MOUNTAINS
ARE IDEAL.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.875
WE COULD HAVE DINNER
IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE

08:04.917 --> 08:06.083
AT SOME HISTORIC LODGE--

08:06.125 --> 08:08.333
AIR IS TOO THIN
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.542
HARD TO BREATHE.
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH FUN.

08:09.583 --> 08:13.041
NOT COMPARED TO
THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.625
HOW ABOUT DISNEYLAND?

08:14.667 --> 08:15.750
HOW ABOUT WE EAT
AT THE SAME TABLE,

08:15.792 --> 08:18.000
NOT TOGETHER, IN SILENCE?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.792
UM, YOU SHOULD KNOW--
DUDE, SILENCE.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.500
RIGHT. DON'T CALL ME "DUDE."

08:24.542 --> 08:26.041
AND THERE'S KETCHUP
ON YOUR FACE.

08:26.083 --> 08:30.417
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:34.583 --> 08:35.709
(indistinct conversations)

08:35.750 --> 08:37.792
WHAT, TOMORROW? I THOUGHT
IT WOULD TAKE MILDRED

08:37.834 --> 08:39.709
AT LEAST A WEEK
TO SET THE APPOINTMENT UP.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.083
IT'S FINE.
I KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY

08:42.125 --> 08:43.333
WHEN SHE ASKS YOU
ABOUT YOU AND HENRY?

08:43.375 --> 08:45.125
I'LL EXPLAIN THAT I ONLY
GIVE HIM GLASS AND KNIVES

08:45.166 --> 08:48.041
TO PLAY WITH WHEN I LEAVE HIM
ALONE FOR HOURS ON END.
JAKE.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.375
(mouth full) STOP WORRYING.

08:49.417 --> 08:52.041
ISN'T THAT ANGELA?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.583
HI!

08:53.625 --> 08:55.542
HEY, HONEY. (kisses) WOW.
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.583
YEAH. ADDISON, HI.
HI.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.041
NOW WAIT A SECOND.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.041
SHOULDN'T YOU, UH,
SHOULDN'T YOU BE STUDYING?

09:00.083 --> 09:03.166
DEAN'S LIST EVERY SEMESTER.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.041
ARE YOU SEEING, UM...
YES. MY BOYFRIEND WANTED
TO SEE IT, SO...

09:06.083 --> 09:08.041
OH, ETHAN'S HERE?
NO. I MOVED ON.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.375
WHAT'D HE DO?

09:09.417 --> 09:11.208
IT'S LESS OF WHAT DID
AND MORE OF WHAT HE WAS--

09:11.250 --> 09:14.375
A TOTAL JERK, YOU KNOW,
STUPID FRAT BOY.

09:14.417 --> 09:15.625
I'M WAY TOO GOOD FOR THAT.

09:15.667 --> 09:16.667
YEAH, YOU ARE.

09:16.709 --> 09:17.792
HEY. BABY.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.709
HEY.
(laughs)

09:19.750 --> 09:20.917
(indistinct conversations
continue)

09:20.959 --> 09:23.250
HI. I'M--I'M ADDISON.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.000
ADDISON, YES.
I'M ELI WILSON.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.792
YEAH. THIS IS JAKE.

09:28.834 --> 09:29.917
HOW YOU DOING?

09:29.959 --> 09:32.041
DR. JAKE REILLY,
ANGELA'S FATHER.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.709
OF COURSE. ANGELA'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.041
I'M IN AWE OF M.D.s.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.041
I'M A DOCTOR, BUT I'M A PhD.
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.041
NO.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.834
SO YOU TEACH?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.375
HUMAN SEXUALITY.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.542
THAT'S WHERE WE MET,
IN CLASS.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.542
HUMAN SEXUALITY CLASS?

09:48.583 --> 09:50.625
I SEE.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.417
HEY, ELI.
THE MOVIE'S ABOUT TO START.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.041
UH, IT WAS GREAT TO MEET YOU,

09:54.083 --> 09:56.709
AND, UH, YOU ARE EVEN
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANGE SAID.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.250
OH.
(laughs)

09:58.291 --> 09:59.625
(laughs)
SEE YOU LATER.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.917
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:02.959 --> 10:04.041
WOW.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.542
NOT A WORD.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.291
NOT A SINGLE WORD.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.250
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE THINKING?

10:14.291 --> 10:17.709
THAT HE'S HANDSOME,
SOPHISTICATED, A DOCTOR.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.041
HE'S NOT A DOCTOR.
HE'S A TEACHER.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.583
I WAS A TEACHER.

10:21.625 --> 10:23.583
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

10:23.625 --> 10:24.917
SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.500
NO. NO, SHE'S NOT.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.083
SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL CLUNKING
AROUND IN HER DADDY'S SHOES,

10:28.125 --> 10:29.959
PRETENDING TO GO OFF TO WORK.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.041
YOU NEED TO LET HER
MAKE HER OWN MISTAKES,

10:33.083 --> 10:34.291
TAKE HER OWN PATH.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.333
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.
THIS IS...

10:36.375 --> 10:37.667
THIS IS BAD.

10:37.709 --> 10:39.125
WELL, IT COULD BE WORSE.
HOW?

10:39.166 --> 10:41.291
SHE COULD BE A DRUG ADDICT,

10:41.333 --> 10:43.000
LIKE HER MOM.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.375
(whispers) HE'S 50?
SERIOUSLY?

10:50.417 --> 10:51.500
(lowered voice)
I COULD DATE HIM,

10:51.542 --> 10:52.667
EXCEPT HE'S A LITTLE OLD
FOR ME.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.625
(lowered voice) IT'S A DISASTER
IN THE MAKING.

10:54.667 --> 10:55.959
(lowered voice)
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.709
I MEAN, IF ANGELA WAS 40,
AND THE GUY WAS NEAR 70--

10:57.750 --> 10:59.792
WE'D THINK MAYBE SHE WAS
AFTER HIS MONEY.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.583
(lowered voice) IT'S A PHASE.
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.083
WELL, OF COURSE
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.333
HOW CAN YOU BE
IN A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP

11:05.375 --> 11:07.041
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S MORE
THAN TWICE YOUR AGE?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.500
EXCEPT THAT THE MATURITY IS PART
OF WHAT ATTRACTS HER TO HIM.

11:10.542 --> 11:11.792
WELL, SHE SHOULD DATE
A GRAD STUDENT THEN.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.834
(whispering) JAKE MUST BE
BLOWING A GASKET.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.542
(whispering)
WHY IS HE BLOWING A GASKET?

11:16.583 --> 11:18.750
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?

11:18.792 --> 11:22.500
JAKE'S DAUGHTER IS DATING
A MAN WAY TOO OLD FOR HER.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.041
OH.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.041
(normal voice) YOU DO KNOW
THAT JAKE ISN'T HERE, RIGHT?

11:28.041 --> 11:30.166
(normal voice) SAM, ANGELA'S 20.
SHE'S A WOMAN.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.792
(normal voice)
20'S NOT A WOMAN.
(normal voice) MAYA'S 19,
AND SHE'S A MOTHER.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.000
GIVING BIRTH
DOES NOT IMPLY MATURITY.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.041
(normal voice) FATHERING A CHILD
CERTAINLY DOESN'T.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.041
OH, YOU CAN'T GENERALIZE.
YOU KNOW, 70 DEGREES IN MAY

11:39.083 --> 11:41.583
DOESN'T SEEM QUITE AS WARM
AS 70 IN DECEMBER.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.041
SEE, I LIKE WHAT YOU DID THERE
WITH THE MAY AND DECEMBER.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.959
I'M SAYING THAT EVERY 20
IS DIFFERENT,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.417
AND YOUR TRANSITION FROM BOY
TO MAN, FORM GIRL TO WOMAN,

11:48.458 --> 11:49.875
DEPENDS ON
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE

11:49.917 --> 11:51.041
AND LIFE EXPERIENCE.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.583
HE'S HER PROFESSOR.

11:52.625 --> 11:53.625
OH.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.792
WELL, THEN FORGET IT.
THERE'S DEFINITELY A...

11:55.834 --> 11:57.542
QUESTIONABLE POWER DYNAMIC
THERE.

11:57.583 --> 12:01.583
MM. SOMETIMES THE STUDENT HAS
THE POWER.

12:01.625 --> 12:02.834
MM.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.709
DID YOU SLEEP
WITH A PROFESSOR?

12:04.750 --> 12:07.875
NOT SO MUCH A AS...

12:07.917 --> 12:09.417
THREE.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.834
THREE? WHEN DID YOU STUDY?

12:11.875 --> 12:13.458
OH.
WAS ONE OF THEM A WOMAN?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.083
LOOK, I WAS FAIRLY TROUBLED
IN COLLEGE.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.208
IT WAS A DARK TIME FOR ME.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.000
SO EXPLORING
MY SEXUAL BOUNDARIES

12:19.041 --> 12:20.458
WAS A WAY OF TAKING BACK
MY SEXUALITY.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
AND ONE OF THEM WAS A WOMAN?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.792
(Sam) LOOK, NO PARENT
WANTS TO THINK

12:23.834 --> 12:25.041
OF ONE OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES

12:25.083 --> 12:27.417
AS HELPING THEIR CHILD EXPLORE
SEXUAL BOUNDARIES.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.083
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS PROFESSOR GUY.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.500
HE NEEDS TO FIND A PLAYMATE
HIS OWN AGE.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.125
YEAH, WELL, ANGELA SEEMS
PRETTY TAKEN WITH HIM,

12:33.166 --> 12:35.041
AND JAKE'S GONNA
HAVE LUNCH WITH HER TODAY

12:35.083 --> 12:36.125
AND--AND TALK ABOUT IT.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.667
HE--HE THINKS IT'LL BE OKAY.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.667
YEAH, HE'S DREAMING.

12:41.709 --> 12:42.834
MM-HMM.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.083
I UNDERSTAND
YOU HAVE A CHILD?

12:44.125 --> 12:45.625
I DO. ANGELA.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.667
HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY
QUITE A WHILE AGO.

12:48.709 --> 12:50.250
ANGELA'S IN COLLEGE,

12:50.291 --> 12:53.333
AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE.
WE, UH, WE TALK ALL THE TIME,

12:53.375 --> 12:55.250
YOU KNOW, ABOUT--
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.041
(chuckles) I'M SURE
YOU THINK SO.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.208
EXCUSE ME?

12:58.250 --> 12:59.500
I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.041
THEY SHARE THE TRIVIAL STUFF

13:01.083 --> 13:03.625
JUST TO THROW YOU OFF THE SCENT
OF THE REALLY BAD STUFF.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.250
YEAH, WELL,
I-I GATHER AS MUCH,

13:05.291 --> 13:07.500
BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE HELL
THEY PUT YOU THROUGH,

13:07.542 --> 13:09.041
UH, YOU KNOW, I ADORE KIDS.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.583
I LOVE HENRY AS THOUGH
HE WERE MY OWN,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.083
AND, YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE
EXPERIENCE IN THIS, UH,

13:13.125 --> 13:14.959
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH ANGE
HASN'T LIVED WITH ME

13:15.000 --> 13:16.291
FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

13:16.333 --> 13:19.041
PARENTHOOD IS A LOT LIKE, UH,
RIDING A BIKE, RIGHT?

13:19.083 --> 13:21.500
NO. WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE
RIDING A BIKE,

13:21.542 --> 13:23.750
YOU FALL,
YOU BREAK YOUR OWN NECK.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.542
WHEN PARENTING A CHILD, FAILURE
CAN BE HARDER TO NOTICE

13:25.583 --> 13:27.041
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.000
OKAY. BUT THE ODDS ARE BETTER
FOR HENRY

13:29.041 --> 13:31.333
BECAUSE HE HAS ADDISON AND ME
SHARING THE RESPONSIBILITIES.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.000
AND YOU BOTH WORK.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.709
RIGHT. UM, BUT ONE OF US IS
ALWAYS THERE FOR HENRY.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.750
I MEAN,
HE'S NEVER LEFT ALONE.

13:37.792 --> 13:41.583
THERE'S A HOME INSPECTION
COMPONENT TO THIS.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.208
I'D LIKE TO COME BY
IN A DAY OR TWO.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.375
PLEASE HAVE THE CHILD PRESENT.
ABSOLUTELY.

13:49.625 --> 13:50.834
WHAT, UH,

13:50.875 --> 13:52.166
WHAT IS THAT?

13:52.208 --> 13:54.166
I NEED TO SEND YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ELECTRONICALLY

13:54.208 --> 13:56.291
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
PART OF THE BACKGROUND CHECK.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.542
PLACE YOUR FINGER
ON THE SCANNER.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.000
PLEASE TRY NOT TO MOVE.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:02.083 --> 14:04.041
DR. REILLY,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

14:04.083 --> 14:05.709
NO.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.667
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

14:10.834 --> 14:11.792
(typing on keyboard)

14:11.834 --> 14:13.000
(computer beeps)

14:17.083 --> 14:20.041
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?

14:20.083 --> 14:21.417
MILDRED'S A LITTLE SCARY.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.041
WELL, I TOLD YOU
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.375
YEAH, I WISH
YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME

14:24.417 --> 14:25.792
ABOUT THE, UH,
FINGERPRINTING, TOO.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.750
OH, I THOUGHT I DID.

14:27.792 --> 14:30.875
WHY? YOU GOT A RECORD
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

14:30.917 --> 14:33.250
JAKE.
IT'S GONNA SOUND
A LOT WORSE THAN IT IS.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.625
OKAY. START TALKING RIGHT NOW,
'CAUSE I'M FREAKING OUT.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.041
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
LILY'S--

14:40.083 --> 14:41.583
LILY STARTED USING AGAIN,

14:41.625 --> 14:44.000
AND HER DIRTBAG DEALER
CAME OVER TO THE HOUSE,

14:44.041 --> 14:47.041
OUR HOUSE, SO I WENT OUTSIDE
TO TELL HIM TO GO AWAY.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.083
HE REFUSED, AND THINGS GOT
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND,

14:49.125 --> 14:50.458
SO THERE WAS A FIGHT.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.667
I WAS PROTECTING
MY--MY WIFE AND CHILD.

14:52.709 --> 14:54.625
OKAY. SO YOU HIT HIM.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.375
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD,
BUT I BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM,

14:57.417 --> 15:00.041
THE COPS CAME,
AND I WAS ARRESTED.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.417
DID YOU GO TO JAIL?

15:02.458 --> 15:04.041
JUST FOR A NIGHT.
BUT I GOT OUT ON BAIL.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.834
I WAS SENTENCED TO PROBATION,
DID SOME COMMUNITY SERVICE.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.375
THE THING IS,
WHEN YOU'RE ARRESTED,

15:08.417 --> 15:10.417
THEY TAKE YOUR PRINTS
AND THEY STAY IN THE SYSTEM,

15:10.458 --> 15:13.667
SO IF MILDRED
RUNS MY PRINTS...

15:13.709 --> 15:15.041
HENRY'S MY SON.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.250
THIS ADOPTION IS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

15:18.291 --> 15:19.917
ADDISON, THIS DEALER
WAS AN ANIMAL

15:19.959 --> 15:21.959
WITH A RAP SHEET LONGER THAN
"WAR AND PEACE."

15:22.000 --> 15:23.542
OKAY? THE JUDGE--
HE UNDERSTOOD MY SIDE.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.959
SO IF MILDRED READS MY FILE,
SHE'S GONNA UNDERSTAND, TOO.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.875
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I PROMISE.

15:35.709 --> 15:38.333
SO...

15:38.375 --> 15:39.917
HOW'S SCHOOL?

15:39.959 --> 15:41.458
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WANNA ASK.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.041
I WAS EASING INTO IT.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.041
DON'T.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.542
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M SURE ELI IS
A VERY NICE MAN.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.417
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT SURE.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.041
I THINK THIS IS
A VERY BAD IDEA.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.250
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.333
YOU USED TO TRUST ME.
I BELIEVE I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT,

15:57.375 --> 16:00.834
AS YOUR FATHER, WHO LOVES YOU,
TO AT LEAST STATE MY OPINION.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.709
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
IF HE WEREN'T YOUR PROFESSOR.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.333
FOR ONE SEMESTER.

16:05.375 --> 16:08.000
THEN HE WON'T BE
MY PROFESSOR ANYMORE.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.333
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.458
YOU DON'T LIKE
HOW OLD HE IS.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.583
NO, I DON'T. HE'S MY AGE.

16:14.625 --> 16:15.709
SOMEDAY I'LL BE YOUR AGE.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.792
AND THEN,
IF YOU STILL WANT TO,

16:16.834 --> 16:18.709
YOU CAN DATE HIM
IN THE NURSING HOME.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.709
SO IF HE WAS TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THAN YOU, THAT WOULD BE OKAY?

16:21.750 --> 16:23.542
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE CUTOFF?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.041
39? 28?

16:25.083 --> 16:26.375
LISTEN, SWEETHEART, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ON--

16:26.417 --> 16:27.750
YOU'RE ON DIFFERENT PLANES.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.750
ALL RIGHT? HE'S GOT 30 YEARS
MORE EXPERIENCE.

16:29.792 --> 16:33.291
YOU'RE INTO YOUR WHAT,
SECOND REAL RELATIONSHIP? HMM?

16:33.333 --> 16:34.333
HE'LL HURT YOU.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.750
ETHAN HURT ME.
HE WAS MY AGE.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.583
WHAT LOOKS RIGHT ON PAPER
ISN'T ALWAYS RIGHT.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.959
(scoffs) YOU MARRIED A DRUG
ADDICT AND YOU WERE HAPPY.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.959
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.041
I DON'T NEED PROTECTION.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.125
I'M AN ADULT.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.542
NOT IF YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.375
I LOVE YOU, DAD,

16:50.417 --> 16:53.792
BUT I ALSO LOVE ELI.

16:53.834 --> 16:57.000
SO DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE, BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE MY CHOICE.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.125
YOU THINK THAT SOCIAL WORKER
WILL FIND OUT?

17:12.166 --> 17:13.709
I DON'T KNOW.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.041
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA KILL THAT GUY.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.542
I WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING
TO PROTECT YOU AND ANGE.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.208
I STILL WOULD,
IF IT MATTERS.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.959
IT DOES MATTER.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.166
YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.250
DON'T--DON'T TELL ME
TO EASE UP ON ELI.

17:30.291 --> 17:34.291
I'M TELLING YOU TO BE THERE FOR
OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE I CAN'T.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.625
SO HEY, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.375
LILY--
NO. NO.

17:37.417 --> 17:40.625
YOU PUSH TOO HARD THE OTHER WAY,
SHE WILL MARRY HIM.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.667
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.583
(indistinct conversations)

17:49.625 --> 17:50.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:50.834 --> 17:54.583
DR. SHEPHERD, WE HAVE TO STOP
MEETING LIKE THIS.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.208
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED,
DR. PETERSON.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.208
I'M JUST SIGNING OFF
ON A CONSULT.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.333
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD CALL ME JAMES

18:00.375 --> 18:01.709
AND I COULD CALL YOU AMELIA?

18:01.750 --> 18:03.083
NOPE.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.583
OKAY, WELL, THAT'LL MAKE
MY NEXT QUESTION TOUGHER.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.208
YOU KNOW, BILLY'S
ON NORTH CANYON?

18:08.250 --> 18:11.250
I'M THERE EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT.
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.917
ANYWAY, YOU SHOULD COME.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.750
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GONNA ASK ME OUT ON A DATE?

18:16.792 --> 18:19.291
I WASN'T. I WAS JUST SAYING,
I EAT DINNER THERE,

18:19.333 --> 18:21.041
AND YOU COULD
EAT DINNER THERE,

18:21.083 --> 18:22.709
AND IF WE HAPPEN TO BE
DOING THAT

18:22.750 --> 18:26.083
AT THE SAME TABLE,
SO BE IT.

18:26.125 --> 18:30.083
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
AT ALL.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.625
THINK ABOUT IT.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.125
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

18:34.166 --> 18:35.959
YOU KNOW,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.709
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES
ARE HARD TO COME BY.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.291
(clicks tongue)

18:43.083 --> 18:45.500
(Cooper) MM.
NO MORE MENTIONS OF SARAH.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.959
IT'S BEEN A WHILE. SHE WENT
MISSING FROM THE E.R.,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.375
WHAT...
SIX WEEKS AGO.

18:49.417 --> 18:50.500
AND THREE DAYS.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.250
(sighs) I HOPE
THAT SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.041
THEY FOUND ELIZABETH SMART
AFTER NINE MONTHS.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.375
WELL,
THAT'S THE EXCEPTION.

18:55.417 --> 18:56.959
THE ODDS OF FINDING
A MISSING CHILD

18:57.000 --> 18:59.542
DROP EXPONENTIALLY
AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.166
HER PARENTS--I DON'T--

19:01.208 --> 19:02.542
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LIVE
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.083
I GUESS AT SOME POINT,
YOU GOTTA MOVE ON, RIGHT?

19:05.125 --> 19:08.041
AND WHEN EXACTLY IS THAT,
WOULD YOU SAY?

19:08.083 --> 19:10.041
I'M ASKING. SERIOUSLY,
WEEKS? MONTHS?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.792
WHEN IS IT OKAY
TO MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE?

19:12.834 --> 19:14.041
NEVER.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.542
LETTING GO TAKES TIME.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.083
YOU'RE PLAGUED WITH MEMORIES
AND BETRAYAL

19:18.125 --> 19:20.625
AND GUILT.
YOU KNOW,
AFTER ANGELA'S MOTHER DIED,

19:20.667 --> 19:23.542
I THINK IT TOOK ME A YEAR
TO SMILE AGAIN.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.291
AS FOR LETTING GO, I THINK
THAT JUST DEPENDS ON THE PERSON.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.750
YEAH. IN THIS SITUATION,
THERE'S NO BODY,

19:28.792 --> 19:30.291
AND THEREFORE NO CLOSURE.
EXACTLY.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.834
IT'S ALL SPECULATION.
SO IF SARAH'S ALIVE

19:32.875 --> 19:34.583
AND COMES BACK AFTER RON
AND DANA HAVE GIVEN UP,

19:34.625 --> 19:35.834
THEY'LL NEVER FORGIVE
THEMSELVES.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.041
BUT IF SHE'S DEAD,

19:38.083 --> 19:39.834
AND THEY DON'T MOVE ON,

19:39.875 --> 19:43.041
THEY COULD SPEND DECADES
JUST WAITING.

19:43.083 --> 19:46.000
I... I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO COUNSEL THEM.

19:48.792 --> 19:50.458
(people speaking indistinctly)

19:50.500 --> 19:54.458
SO LUNCH DIDN'T GO SO GREAT.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.542
WELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK,

19:57.583 --> 19:59.458
ONCE YOU TOLD HER
THAT YOU DIDN'T APPROVE,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.041
THAT ANGELA WOULD JUST END IT?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.041
SHE LIKES HIM.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.333
APPARENTLY, SHE LOVES HIM.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.041
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL DOES
SHE SEE IN THE GUY ANYWAY?

20:07.083 --> 20:09.583
I'M NOT SURE I CAN ANSWER THAT
WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.333
ALL RIGHT, I'M SURE THE GUY
HAS HIS POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES,

20:11.375 --> 20:12.875
AND IF HE WEREN'T THE LECH
AFTER MY DAUGHTER,

20:12.917 --> 20:14.959
I MIGHT EVEN SEE THEM.
THIS--THIS CAN'T GO ON.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.583
WELL, IT CAN
IF THEY WANT IT TO.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.125
I MEAN, HONEY, THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.667
I CAN CALL THE UNIVERSITY
AND HAVE HIM FIRED.

20:19.709 --> 20:22.041
WELL, THAT WILL ALL BUT ENSURE
THAT SHE MARRIES THE GUY.

20:22.083 --> 20:25.625
LOOK, ANGELA'S A SMART GIRL.
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.458
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, SHE'S GONNA
GET THERE A LOT FASTER

20:27.500 --> 20:28.709
IF THE TWO OF YOU MAKE PEACE.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.875
WHAT? NO.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.041
YES. YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP

20:32.083 --> 20:34.250
AND INVITE THEM OVER
FOR DINNER.

20:34.291 --> 20:37.458
(pager beeps and buzzes)

20:37.500 --> 20:39.041
OH, NO.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.625
MEGAN'S IN THE E.R.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.417
(sighs)

20:46.542 --> 20:48.041
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.500
I STARTED CRAMPING AND I KEPT
TRYING TO STAY CALM

20:50.542 --> 20:52.834
AND TELL MYSELF ALL THE STUFF
YOU ALWAYS SAY,

20:52.875 --> 20:53.875
BUT IT WASN'T WORKING.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.041
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.625
NO, MEGAN, YOU KNOW THAT
MILD CRAMPING IS NORMAL

20:57.667 --> 20:58.959
AFTER FERTILITY TREATMENTS.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.041
I KNOW. BUT THIS--

21:00.083 --> 21:01.291
YOUR BETA h.C.G. IS FINE.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.250
YOUR OS IS CLOSED.
THERE'S NO BLEEDING.

21:03.291 --> 21:05.041
THERE'S NO DISCHARGE.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.041
IT'S TOO EARLY TO SEE ANYTHING
ON THE ULTRASOUND,

21:07.083 --> 21:09.041
BUT YOUR--
YOUR TESTS WERE NORMAL.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.917
YOU'RE SCARED.
THAT--THAT'S ALL.

21:10.959 --> 21:14.041
(chuckles)

21:14.083 --> 21:15.750
OH. (laughs)

21:15.792 --> 21:18.667
OH, GOD.
UH, I'M THAT PERSON.

21:18.709 --> 21:21.709
I'M THE CRAZY PATIENT
WHO FREAKS OUT EVERY 15 MINUTES

21:21.750 --> 21:23.125
AND PULLS YOU AWAY
FROM YOUR LIFE.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.417
I'M SO SORRY.

21:24.458 --> 21:25.750
COME ON NOW.
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

21:25.792 --> 21:29.375
NO, I DO. I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
OH. (chuckles)

21:29.417 --> 21:31.875
I'M NOT THIS FRAGILE PERSON.
REALLY, I'M NOT.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.667
IT'S JUST--

21:33.709 --> 21:37.000
DANNY'S AWAY, AND THIS IS
OUR FIFTH TIME TRYING.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.583
AND NO MATTER
HOW HARD I TRY TO RELAX,

21:38.625 --> 21:42.667
I'M JUST... WAITING.

21:42.709 --> 21:43.875
FOR WHAT?

21:43.917 --> 21:46.333
(sighs deeply)

21:46.375 --> 21:48.000
(voice breaks)
TO LOSE THE PREGNANCY.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.959
LAST TIME I MADE IT 12 WEEKS,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.667
WHICH WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT
OVER FOUR,

21:52.709 --> 21:56.041
BUT NINE MONTHS--
THAT'S AN ETERNITY.

21:56.083 --> 21:59.250
AND AFTER SO MANY... (sighs)

21:59.291 --> 22:01.500
FAILURES...

22:01.542 --> 22:03.542
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST ME.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.583
NO, MEGAN, WE--WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS. RIGHT?

22:06.625 --> 22:07.917
WITH EVERY ROLL OF THE DICE,

22:07.959 --> 22:10.792
YOUR CHANCES OF THIS ONE
STICKING ACTUALLY IMPROVE.

22:12.667 --> 22:13.709
REALLY?

22:13.750 --> 22:14.750
YES.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.542
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT

22:16.583 --> 22:19.000
AND HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

22:20.083 --> 22:21.750
AND NOT BE HYSTERICAL.
(laughs)

22:21.792 --> 22:23.500
THAT WOULD HELP, TOO.
(chuckles)

22:23.542 --> 22:25.208
OKAY. NOW THERE'S
NO MEDICAL REASON

22:25.250 --> 22:26.500
WHY I SHOULDN'T
DISCHARGE YOU.

22:26.542 --> 22:30.083
I-I'M NOT READY TO--
I-I JUST FEEL BETTER

22:30.125 --> 22:32.500
HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.
IS THAT CRAZY?

22:32.542 --> 22:34.834
NO. THE HOSPITAL'S
A SAFE PLACE TO BE.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.750
WOULD YOU MIND--I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU'RE BUSY AND EVERYTHING,

22:37.792 --> 22:40.250
BUT COULD YOU STAY JUST--
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

22:40.291 --> 22:42.000
JUST UNTIL I'M SURE
THAT EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

22:44.792 --> 22:45.750
(door closes)

22:45.792 --> 22:48.583
(footsteps approach)

22:48.625 --> 22:49.458
HEY, BABE.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.250
HEY.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

22:51.291 --> 22:52.625
YOU WERE LATE TWO HOURS AGO,

22:52.667 --> 22:54.166
BUT YOU'RE IN TIME
FOR LEFTOVERS.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.583
I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL
WITH MEGAN.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.583
WHAT, DID SHE MISCARRY AGAIN?

22:57.625 --> 22:59.000
NO. NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH HER MEDICALLY.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.041
SHE WAS SCARED, THOUGH,
THOUGHT SHE WAS LOSING HER BABY,

23:01.083 --> 23:04.417
SO I STAYED WITH HER.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.709
YOU WERE PAGED
OVER SIX HOURS AGO.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.291
YEAH, WELL, FEAR
ISN'T LIKE PAIN, HONEY.

23:08.333 --> 23:11.291
YOU CAN'T JUST MEDICATE SOMEONE
AND LEAVE IN FIVE MINUTES.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.041
WELL, YEAH, YOU ALSO CAN'T
SIGN UP FOR NINE MONTHS OF THIS.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.375
THAT'S WHAT I DO,
ESPECIALLY IN MEGAN'S CASE,

23:16.417 --> 23:18.625
WITH HER HUSBAND GONE
AS MUCH AS HE IS.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.417
SHE NEEDS THE EXTRA SUPPORT.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.000
I THINK THAT THE LEVEL
OF DOCTORING THAT MEGAN NEEDS

23:23.041 --> 23:25.083
IS BORDERING
ON UNREASONABLE.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.250
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S MAKING UP EXCUSES
TO SEE YOU.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.041
SHE THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
WELL, SOMETHING'S
DEFINITELY WRONG.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.625
PART OF IT'S IN HER HEAD
AND PART OF IT'S ON YOU.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.041
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

23:33.083 --> 23:36.083
OKAY, YOU SERIOUSLY CANNOT SEE
HOW YOU ARE COMPLICIT IN THIS?

23:36.125 --> 23:39.417
YOU ARE SO KIND AND SO AVAILABLE
THAT YOU MAKE IT EASY

23:39.458 --> 23:40.667
FOR PATIENTS
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

23:40.709 --> 23:41.959
LOOK, IF I CAN'T BE THERE
FOR MY PATIENTS,

23:42.000 --> 23:43.333
IF I CAN'T GIVE THEM
ALL THAT I GOT,

23:43.375 --> 23:44.750
THEN I MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE UP MEDICINE.

23:44.792 --> 23:47.041
OKAY, BUT YOU CANNOT BE THERE
FOR ALL OF THEM ALL THE TIME.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.125
YOU'VE GOT TO SET BOUNDARIES
BECAUSE THEY WON'T.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.625
STOP. STOP TRYING TO TELL ME
HOW TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,

23:51.667 --> 23:53.041
HOW TO RUN MY LIFE,

23:53.083 --> 23:54.667
BECAUSE I WAS DOING JUST FINE
BEFORE YOU CAME ALONG.

23:54.709 --> 23:57.041
BUT I AM HERE NOW,
AND THE CHOICES THAT YOU MAKE--

23:57.083 --> 23:58.959
THEY AFFECT OUR LIFE.

23:59.041 --> 24:00.834
I MEAN, HOW IS IT
THAT YOU CAN COMMIT

24:00.875 --> 24:03.041
TO THESE WOMEN YOU BARELY KNOW
AND YOU CAN'T COMMIT TO ME?

24:03.083 --> 24:04.458
I'M A FERTILITY SPECIALIST.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.542
THE WOMEN THAT COME TO ME--
WHEN THEY GET PREGNANT,

24:06.583 --> 24:08.625
IT'S MY JOB TO SEE THEM
THROUGH THE NINE MONTHS,

24:08.667 --> 24:11.041
AND I WON'T STOP DOING THAT,
NO MATTER HOW JEALOUS

24:11.083 --> 24:12.500
OR INSECURE OR CRAZY YOU GET.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.041
W--
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.041
REALLY?
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE IS.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.792
NICE JOB PISSING OFF
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.917
NO, JUST THE WOMEN.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.792
REALLY? YOU GONNA GRAB ELI

24:33.834 --> 24:35.041
AND TAKE HIM
TO A CIGAR BAR THEN?

24:35.083 --> 24:37.041
LOOK, I GOT IT FROM ANGE,
I GOT IT FROM ADDISON.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.500
I DON'T NEED IT FROM YOU.

24:38.542 --> 24:39.750
WELL, ADDISON'S RIGHT.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.041
BALANCE, BOUNDARIES--
THOSE THINGS MATTER.

24:42.083 --> 24:43.875
YOU ALWAYS GAVE TOO MUCH
AT THE OFFICE.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.750
LOOK, YOU CANNOT BLAME
THE DRUGS ON ME.
I KNOW.

24:45.792 --> 24:48.000
OKAY, 'CAUSE I WAS THERE
ALL THE TIME,

24:48.041 --> 24:51.542
UNTIL I COULDN'T WATCH YOU
DESTROY YOURSELF ANYMORE.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.959
I KNOW.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.500
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

24:55.542 --> 24:58.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AVOID
GOING HOME ANYMORE.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.834
THERE'S NO MORE DRUGS
IN YOUR LIFE,

25:00.875 --> 25:02.709
NO MORE TERROR,

25:02.750 --> 25:04.417
NO MORE ME.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.041
IT'S JUST THE WOMAN
WHO LOVES YOU, HER KID,

25:08.083 --> 25:10.625
AND OUR KID.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.792
THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR WAY
EXCEPT YOU.

25:15.417 --> 25:16.625
(elevator bell dings)

25:16.667 --> 25:18.000
(doors open)

25:18.041 --> 25:19.625
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

25:19.667 --> 25:22.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:22.083 --> 25:24.041
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.750
THANKS.
(doors close)

25:26.792 --> 25:28.000
I JUST MEANT--

25:28.041 --> 25:30.125
NO, I FEEL LIKE CRAP,
SO IT'S FITTING.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.834
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MANY THINGS
THAT I'VE LEARNED THIS PAST YEAR

25:33.875 --> 25:36.417
IS TO BE A VERY GOOD LISTENER.

25:36.458 --> 25:38.041
I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT THE ELEVATOR RIDE IS

25:38.083 --> 25:40.375
WAY TOO SHORT
FOR WHAT I'VE GOT GOING ON.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.458
(ding)

25:42.500 --> 25:43.750
JAKE.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.458
(people speaking
indistinctly)

25:45.500 --> 25:47.458
DR. SHEPHERD.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.500
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

25:53.000 --> 25:54.250
(clicks button)

25:54.291 --> 25:56.375
(doors close)

25:56.417 --> 25:57.875
(ding)

25:57.917 --> 25:59.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

25:59.834 --> 26:01.333
SEE YOU.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.667
(speaking indistinctly)

26:07.709 --> 26:10.834
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MANY THINGS
I'VE LEARNED OVER THE PAST YEAR

26:10.875 --> 26:13.166
SINCE I JOINED THE PRACTICE
IS THAT APPARENTLY,

26:13.208 --> 26:15.041
EVERYONE ELSE'S BUSINESS
IS MINE,

26:15.083 --> 26:17.041
SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT--

26:17.083 --> 26:19.875
JAMES IS A GOOD GUY.

26:19.917 --> 26:21.208
OKAY.

26:21.250 --> 26:24.583
AMELIA, MY DAUGHTER IS DATING
HER COLLEGE PROFESSOR,

26:24.625 --> 26:26.041
AND WHILE I WISH
SHE WASN'T DATING AT ALL,

26:26.083 --> 26:28.750
IF SHE HAS TO BE, THEN, WELL,

26:28.792 --> 26:30.834
I THINK SOMEONE LIKE JAMES IS
A PRETTY GOOD CATCH.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.291
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU DATE HIM THEN?

26:32.333 --> 26:33.834
I'M SPOKEN FOR.
I DON'T THINK OF HIM
LIKE THAT.

26:33.875 --> 26:36.500
YES, YOU DO.
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

26:36.542 --> 26:39.542
IT'S JUST--EVERYTHING'S GOOD
NOW, YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T--

26:39.583 --> 26:41.041
YOU DID ALL THAT WORK,

26:41.083 --> 26:43.041
YOU'VE COME SO FAR,
DON'T...

26:43.083 --> 26:45.959
DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM AN OPPORTUNITY.

26:46.041 --> 26:49.041
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.500
BE HAPPY, AMELIA.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.667

over p.a.)

27:00.834 --> 27:02.166

27:02.208 --> 27:03.875
THIS WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA.

27:03.917 --> 27:06.667

I LISTENED TO YOU.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.041
ANGELA'S YOUR DAUGHTER

27:08.083 --> 27:09.709
AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.542
YOU AND I CAN RESUME FIGHTING
AFTER DINNER,

27:11.583 --> 27:14.667
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
LET'S JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.000
SHALL WE?
(cork pops)

27:28.625 --> 27:30.500
THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING US OVER.

27:30.542 --> 27:32.667
YES, THANK YOU.
NO, WE'RE JUST HAPPY

27:32.709 --> 27:35.917
THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT ON
SUCH SHORT NOTICE, RIGHT, HONEY?

27:35.959 --> 27:38.000
YES, VERY HAPPY.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.834
UM, SO, ELI,

27:43.875 --> 27:47.917
ANGELA TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE
A BIG BASKETBALL FAN, HUH?

27:47.959 --> 27:49.625
AND SO IS JAKE.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.000
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

27:51.041 --> 27:52.709
WELL, WE SHOULD CATCH
A LAKERS GAME SOMETIME.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.709

AT WINNING IT ALL THIS YEAR.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.041
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE OKLAHOMA CITY.

27:56.083 --> 27:59.709
THEY'RE YOUNG, FRESH,
NO BAGGAGE.

27:59.750 --> 28:03.583
HMM. BUT THE, UH, LAKERS HAVE
THE VETERANS AND THE EXPERIENCE.

28:03.625 --> 28:06.291
THAT'S IMPORTANT
FOR A BALANCED TEAM.

28:06.333 --> 28:07.792
BALANCE IS OVERRATED.

28:07.834 --> 28:08.625
I THINK THE ROOKIES

28:08.667 --> 28:10.750
ARE DOING FINE ON THEIR OWN.

28:10.792 --> 28:12.333

28:35.792 --> 28:39.375

28:39.417 --> 28:43.875
ANGELA'S VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

SURE.

28:45.959 --> 28:47.375
LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN
WHO ADORES YOU,

28:47.417 --> 28:50.583
WHO THINKS EVERY WORD OUT OF
YOUR MOUTH IS WITTY AND CLEVER

28:50.625 --> 28:51.917
BECAUSE SHE PROBABLY
DOESN'T KNOW

28:51.959 --> 28:53.667
YOU'VE BEEN USING
THOSE SAME, OLD TIRED LINES

28:53.709 --> 28:56.291
ON WOMEN YOUR AGE FOR DECADES.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.583
YEAH, THAT'S GOTTA BE NICE.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.041
I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR AN EGO BOOST.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.917
THEN WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING FOR?

29:01.959 --> 29:03.583
BECAUSE THERE IS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

29:03.625 --> 29:07.041
WHEN YOU FINISHED YOUR PhD,
SHE WAS IN DIAPERS.

29:07.083 --> 29:10.041
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR RESERVATIONS.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.625
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.041
BUT I'M NOT A BAD GUY.

29:14.083 --> 29:19.041
OKAY, I WAS MARRIED
TO A WOMAN MY AGE FOR 20 YEARS.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.625
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.208
SO NOW YOU'VE DECIDED TO USE
THE FEMALE STUDENT POPULATION

29:23.250 --> 29:24.750
AS YOUR OWN
PERSONAL DATING POOL?

29:24.792 --> 29:27.709
I HAVE NEVER
DATED A STUDENT BEFORE.

29:27.750 --> 29:31.875
BUT... ANGELA IS...

29:31.917 --> 29:33.291
KIND AND BRIGHT

29:33.333 --> 29:35.917

AND CURIOUS--

29:35.959 --> 29:38.792

I RAISED HER.

29:39.959 --> 29:41.041

29:41.083 --> 29:43.875
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.542
'CAUSE THIS IS OVER.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.709
I WON'T STOP
SEEING YOUR DAUGHTER.

I'M NOT ASKING.

A VERY THINLY VEILED THREAT.

PRETTY SURE HE DOES, TOO.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.041
WOULD YOU WANT ME TO GIVE ANGE
AWAY AT THEIR WEDDING?

30:20.083 --> 30:22.166
WELL, I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
WEDDING TO CONSIDER BEFORE HERS.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.750
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.041

36:33.083 --> 36:35.041
IS HE EVER HERE?

36:35.083 --> 36:37.583
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
DOES HE EVEN WANT A BABY?

36:37.625 --> 36:39.959
STOP IT. STOP--

36:40.000 --> 36:41.667
I'M SORRY. I AM SO SORRY
THAT THINGS HAVE NOT

36:41.709 --> 36:43.333
TURNED OUT THE WAY
THAT YOU PLANNED,

36:43.375 --> 36:45.625
BUT THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT

36:45.667 --> 36:48.667
TO BLAME THE ONE MAN
WHO HAS TRIED TO HELP YOU.

36:48.709 --> 36:52.417
YOU DO NOT GET TO LIE ABOUT HIM,
NOT EVER.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.625
(knock on door)

37:19.667 --> 37:21.166
COME ON IN. IT'S OPEN.

37:21.208 --> 37:24.041
OKAY, THAT'S MILDRED.
I WANT YOU TO DO A GUY A SOLID

37:24.083 --> 37:26.458
AND YOU BE
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR, OKAY?

37:26.500 --> 37:27.834
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

37:27.875 --> 37:28.959
ANGE, THIS--

37:29.000 --> 37:30.041
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
A GREAT TIME. ALL RIGHT?

37:30.083 --> 37:31.667
I DON'T CARE.

37:31.709 --> 37:32.625
YOU ARE MY ONLY FAMILY,

37:32.667 --> 37:34.709
THE MAN I LOOKED UP
TO MY WHOLE LIFE,

37:34.750 --> 37:36.709
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING--
YOUR FATHER.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.041
ALL RIGHT,
I'M BEING YOUR FATHER.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.959
I LOVE YOU, BUT I DON'T
LIKE ELI, NOT FOR YOU.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.834
TELL ME ELI MISUNDERSTOOD.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.542
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T SAY
THOSE THINGS TO MY BOYFRIEND.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.333
LOOK, IT'S MY JOB
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

37:45.375 --> 37:47.959
BY THREATENING HIS LIFE?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.709
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

37:55.875 --> 37:57.000
(door closes)

37:58.709 --> 38:01.750
I AM SO SORRY. I-I'LL DO
ANYTHING TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

38:01.792 --> 38:04.041
I-I'LL CALL MILDRED.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.041
(sighs deeply)

38:06.083 --> 38:07.750
PLEASE, JUST...

38:07.792 --> 38:10.291
SAY SOMETHING.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.000
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

38:15.083 --> 38:17.041
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD,
AND YOU SHOULD BE,

38:17.083 --> 38:18.959
AND YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT MEGAN,
ABOUT ANGELA,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.250
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.667
I'M SORRY, TRULY.

38:23.709 --> 38:25.875
I FULLY ACCEPT
ALL OF YOUR APOLOGIES,

38:25.917 --> 38:28.041
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE,

38:28.083 --> 38:31.041
BECAUSE HENRY IS MY SON,
AND YOU ARE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

38:31.083 --> 38:33.542
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
A FAMILY,

38:33.583 --> 38:35.500
AND MILDRED WILL SEE THAT.

38:35.542 --> 38:38.667
I KNOW SHE WILL. I JUST...

38:38.709 --> 38:40.709
I JUST KNOW IT.

38:49.542 --> 38:52.709
YOU DIDN'T COME THIS MORNING,

38:52.750 --> 38:55.041
TO THE BLUFFS.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.709
YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW UP HERE.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.625
I CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

38:58.667 --> 39:02.250
YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

39:02.291 --> 39:03.500
NO.
