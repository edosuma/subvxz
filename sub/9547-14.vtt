English, English

00:13.951 --> 00:15.265
learn english!

00:15.385 --> 00:18.374
My three-year-old nephew
can speak it and he's an idiot.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.770
How hard can it be?

00:19.890 --> 00:21.668
Set traps on your way out.

00:21.865 --> 00:23.095
Set traps.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.739
Senor Bennie, no me gustan la trampas.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.852
- You don't like traps.
- Podrian matar a alguien.

00:26.872 --> 00:29.177
Of course it can kill someone.
That's the whole point.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.904
If somebody breaks in here,
somebody tries to rob from me,

00:32.024 --> 00:33.748
they get what's comin' to 'em!

00:33.985 --> 00:35.358
That's how we do things.

00:35.478 --> 00:37.519
Listen, when you're an American,

00:37.772 --> 00:38.948
you'll understand.

01:17.093 --> 01:17.942
Okay.

01:18.454 --> 01:22.274
Okay, don't do anything stupid.

01:24.124 --> 01:25.608
Not much of a talker?

01:25.696 --> 01:29.215
Don't take another step,
i'm warning you, not one more step.

01:36.827 --> 01:38.447
I tried to tell you.

01:38.948 --> 01:40.723
Nobody listens to me.

02:45.921 --> 02:47.590
Do you love your job?

02:47.811 --> 02:49.335
Do I love my job?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.552
Yeah-no, not all the time.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.710
But most of the time, yeah,
I love my job.

02:54.830 --> 02:57.113
- Why, what's going on?
- I just came from court.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.885
They convicted that David Grisham.

03:00.005 --> 03:03.758
Yeah, right. I remember him.
He strangled his wife.

03:03.878 --> 03:06.485
Well...
Congratulations.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.229
It used to make me feel great.

03:10.406 --> 03:12.528
But today,
all I could think was,

03:12.658 --> 03:13.912
so what?

03:14.378 --> 03:16.109
This creep's going away.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.903
There's ten other creeps out there
ready to take his place.

03:19.023 --> 03:20.219
What good am I doing?

03:20.339 --> 03:23.524
I'm sure the families of the victim
appreciate your work,

03:23.644 --> 03:25.403
and the people of San Francisco.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.428
All right, all right, Adrian. Adrian.

03:29.548 --> 03:30.540
I understand.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.908
- Now, you're feeling unfulfilled.
- It's all the same.

03:32.966 --> 03:35.170
Crime scene, witness,
suspect, question, answer.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.493
Okay, this-this is perfectly normal,
Adrian.

03:37.613 --> 03:40.972
No job can completely satisfy anyone.

03:41.092 --> 03:43.136
There is more to life than just working.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.671
- I know that.
- Let me finish. Or cleaning.

03:49.043 --> 03:50.779
Maybe you should take up a hobby.

03:51.347 --> 03:52.234
Hobby?

03:52.692 --> 03:56.869
Yeah. Outside of work.
A creative outlet to express yourself.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.865
- Hobby?
- Yes, a hobby. It's great therapy.

03:59.985 --> 04:02.685
You know, I recently
took up ballroom dancing.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.669
Good for you.

04:05.789 --> 04:06.905
Yeah, well.

04:07.025 --> 04:08.279
Unfortunately, Madeline.

04:08.329 --> 04:11.571
She doesn't love it as much as I do,
so a lot of the time when I go to class,

04:11.621 --> 04:13.086
I don't have a partner.

04:19.113 --> 04:21.550
I'm not gonna dance with you,
dr. Kroger.

04:21.670 --> 04:22.522
Don't.

04:22.642 --> 04:24.528
Don't make me dance with you,
dr. Kroger.

04:24.559 --> 04:27.723
- No. No, Adrian, I am not suggesting.
- I can't dance with you, dr. Kroger.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.633
I didn't ask you to dance with me,
Adrian.

04:29.664 --> 04:31.295
I was talking about a different hobby.

04:31.348 --> 04:33.106
- Not dancing.
- <I>Not dancing!

04:34.576 --> 04:35.850
Not dancing.

04:40.568 --> 04:41.898
Nothing personal.

04:43.797 --> 04:44.791
Hobby?

04:44.911 --> 04:46.453
I think that's a great idea.

04:46.473 --> 04:47.631
I'm sure you do.

04:47.651 --> 04:49.733
What about collecting Rocks?
You love Rocks.

04:49.853 --> 04:51.864
Dr. Kroger says Rocks don't count.

04:51.984 --> 04:54.939
It has to be creative.
I'm supposed to be expressing myself.

04:55.059 --> 04:57.189
All right, why don't you write a book,
like a novel?

04:57.579 --> 04:59.219
- About what?
- I don't know.

04:59.472 --> 05:01.986
Well, what would it be called?
I mean, who would be in it?

05:02.106 --> 05:03.879
Would they say?
Would the other people say?

05:03.999 --> 05:05.962
- Okay, forget about the novel.
- Okay.

05:06.685 --> 05:08.742
- God.
- You all right?

05:08.884 --> 05:10.904
Why are people always killing people

05:11.024 --> 05:12.230
in places like this?

05:12.250 --> 05:14.447
I don't know, Mr. Monk.
But I'll see what I can do.

05:14.494 --> 05:16.837
Monk. Ms. Teeger. Thank you for coming.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.103
I know this isn't exactly
your, venue of choice.

05:20.223 --> 05:22.148
- Yeah, what's going on?
- It could be nothing.

05:22.430 --> 05:23.722
It's probably nothing.

05:23.908 --> 05:26.370
That's the owner.
His name's Bennie Wentworth.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.451
He's owned this place for 20 years.

05:28.590 --> 05:29.825
He is a piece of work.

05:29.995 --> 05:34.217
Two tours of duty in Vietnam,
special forces, counter-insurgency.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.023
- He's an expert in Booby Traps.
- Booby Traps.

05:37.143 --> 05:40.618
Yeah, he's got an assistant named,
Hector, Something.

05:40.766 --> 05:43.266
He set these traps every night,
so they're all over the yard.

05:43.286 --> 05:44.523
Don't touch anything.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.365
Yeah, don't worry, I won't.

05:47.891 --> 05:48.856
So who is he?

05:48.894 --> 05:51.449
So far, he's a nobody.
No ID, no wallet.

05:51.512 --> 05:53.386
He cut through the fence
around 5:00 a.m.

05:54.144 --> 05:56.247
Well... Which car was his?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.716
No car.
Well, not that we found.

05:59.922 --> 06:02.869
So he breaks in,
he steps on this

06:02.989 --> 06:06.090
-  tripwire.
- Right, which was tied to the shotgun,

06:06.585 --> 06:08.678
- took both barrels.
- Wait, is that legal?

06:08.798 --> 06:11.458
That's not for me to decide.
The d.a.'s working on it.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.349
- Booby trap!
- Randy! Randy! Randy!

06:15.469 --> 06:19.298
Randy! It's not a Booby Trap.
It's a spider's web.

06:19.691 --> 06:22.354
What's going on? Did you break this?

06:22.971 --> 06:23.652
Sorry.

06:23.672 --> 06:25.731
You break it, you bought it.
That's the rules.

06:25.751 --> 06:28.164
It's a Junkyard.
How do you know if something's broken?

06:28.184 --> 06:29.708
I know. I can tell, look.

06:30.084 --> 06:32.927
This wheel is all bent. 40 bucks.

06:33.047 --> 06:34.422
40 bucks, no way.

06:34.542 --> 06:38.388
Mr. Wentworth. This is Adrian Monk and
Natalie Teeger. They're helping us out.

06:38.442 --> 06:41.179
I was wondering, could you go over
the whole thing again please?

06:41.199 --> 06:44.510
Go over what? The guy was on
my property, he tried to rip me off,

06:44.630 --> 06:46.826
he got what was comin' to him,
end of story!

06:46.846 --> 06:49.603
I'll tell you what, give me 20 bucks,
we'll forget the whole thing.

06:49.630 --> 06:50.585
Not paying for it.

06:50.605 --> 06:53.286
What was he doing here, mr. Wentworth?
What do you think he was after?

06:53.306 --> 06:57.320
I don't know. Maybe he needed
a carburetor. People need carburetors.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.388
He was wearing a $2,000 suit.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.424
And those are Italian shoes.
I think he could afford a carburetor.

07:02.544 --> 07:04.984
Maybe he stole the suit.
That's possible, isn't it?

07:05.104 --> 07:07.993
Maybe he stole the shoes!
Maybe he was on a spree!

07:08.113 --> 07:11.837
Suit, shoes, and a carburetor.
What kind of spree is that?

07:12.026 --> 07:14.722
I don't know.
An eclectic spree.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.420
Do you have any enemies?

07:16.500 --> 07:20.322
None that I can think of. Except for
this guy, the bicycle thief. Ten bucks.

07:20.442 --> 07:23.092
- No.
- Okay, five bucks. Final offer.

07:23.212 --> 07:25.668
- Randy, give him five bucks.
- Fine.

07:26.686 --> 07:28.615
I wonder what happened to his partner.

07:28.765 --> 07:29.795
What partner?

07:29.915 --> 07:31.543
It's a dirt road out there.

07:32.031 --> 07:34.595
Very little dust on his shoes.

07:35.041 --> 07:36.932
Somebody must have dropped him off.

07:37.485 --> 07:40.263
Maybe they took off
when they heard the gunshots.

07:40.831 --> 07:44.196
Secure the road. Tell the crime scene
techs to check for tire tracks.

07:44.316 --> 07:45.260
Yes, sir.

07:46.476 --> 07:47.402
Randy.

07:48.344 --> 07:49.347
Your bike.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.719
Hey, Mr. Monk.

08:00.839 --> 08:02.430
- How about painting?
- Painting...

08:02.550 --> 08:05.972
That's a hobby. I bet you'd love it.
You're a very visual person.

08:06.568 --> 08:07.468
I am?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.675
You're a painter?

08:08.795 --> 08:10.657
I got everything you need right here.

08:10.777 --> 08:12.220
I just picked these up.

08:12.340 --> 08:16.097
I got a whole starting kit, good as new.
I'll throw in these canvases!

08:16.596 --> 08:17.657
The whole shebang.

08:18.756 --> 08:20.049
$50.00.

08:20.569 --> 08:21.454
I don't know.

08:21.574 --> 08:23.980
Painting.
I don't think it's for me.

08:24.147 --> 08:25.613
- I'll pay for it.
- Okay.

09:48.263 --> 09:50.428
Mr. Monk, I have to pick up Julie soon.

09:59.811 --> 10:01.832
- You're supposed to mix the colors.
- I can't.

10:01.852 --> 10:02.595
Okay.

10:03.331 --> 10:04.759
Don't mix the colors.

10:05.623 --> 10:06.909
What are you doing?

10:07.142 --> 10:10.256
- Washing the brush. I got paint on it.
- No, there's supposed to be paint-

10:10.713 --> 10:14.431
Mr. Monk, what. Why don't you.
Why don't you... Take an art class?

10:14.551 --> 10:16.714
You know, just to learn the,
The basic techniques.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.683
There's a community college
five blocks away. I'il sign you up.

10:19.803 --> 10:22.155
No.
No, I don't need a class.

10:22.353 --> 10:24.803
I'm fine. I'm good, just.

10:24.923 --> 10:26.648
Here's we go. Let's go.

10:34.815 --> 10:36.905
- I'm thinking yellow.
- Yellow would be good.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.939
It dripped.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.330
Here, hold that.
Just grab the other side.

10:44.350 --> 10:47.281
No, Mr. Monk, it's fine. You've already
thrown away three dropcloths.

10:47.301 --> 10:49.728
It's supposed to be messy.
You know, it's part of the fun.

10:49.848 --> 10:52.570
- This was a bad idea.
- No, it's not. You're doing good. Just,

10:52.833 --> 10:54.143
don't think so much.

10:54.263 --> 10:55.641
- Don't think.
- So much.

10:55.761 --> 10:57.055
Don't think.

10:57.862 --> 10:59.048
Don't think.

11:00.823 --> 11:01.845
Don't think.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.792
Don't think.

11:05.642 --> 11:06.877
So much.

11:14.830 --> 11:15.986
Don't think.

11:22.984 --> 11:24.238
Look what I did.

11:24.646 --> 11:26.101
It's terrible.

11:26.221 --> 11:28.393
- It's just.
- No no no no no, don't start over.

11:28.423 --> 11:30.654
- No. I like it, it's good. I like it.
- No, it's bad.

11:30.674 --> 11:32.452
I messed it up.
You told me not to think!

11:32.501 --> 11:35.588
- No, it's good.
- It's-it's flat. It's flat!

11:41.631 --> 11:42.339
Thank.

11:42.395 --> 11:44.686
I'm calling the school.
You're taking the class.

11:47.384 --> 11:48.685
Mr. Bennie.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.373
Buenos días.

11:54.426 --> 11:55.970
Siento llegar tarde.

11:56.832 --> 11:58.742
Mr. Bennie, qu'hace est durmiendio.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.039
Mr. Bennie.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.575
Mr. Bennie qu'hace?

12:05.878 --> 12:07.092
Mr. Bennie.

12:12.740 --> 12:13.896
Ay, dios mío.

12:26.775 --> 12:30.932
People, don't look at the landscape,
feel the landscape.

12:31.052 --> 12:33.849
Let the landscape speak to you.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.097
Yes!

12:38.217 --> 12:40.087
Angie. I love it.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.729
There's a wonderful negative energy.

12:43.678 --> 12:47.874
People, don't be afraid.
Be fearless. You are an artist.

12:48.341 --> 12:50.521
You are fearless.

12:51.143 --> 12:53.651
There is no right or wrong here.

12:59.614 --> 13:01.208
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

13:01.328 --> 13:02.440
- Adrian.
- Adrian.

13:03.455 --> 13:05.596
- Who told you you could draw?
- Natalie.

13:06.347 --> 13:08.848
- What are those?
- Clouds.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.879
That's how I see it.

13:13.177 --> 13:14.624
Well, you're seeing it wrong.

13:14.938 --> 13:16.992
You said there was no right or wrong.

13:17.248 --> 13:18.270
Well...

13:19.684 --> 13:20.893
Never say that again.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.013
This feels familiar.

13:31.571 --> 13:32.392
Monk!

13:32.755 --> 13:36.785
Miss Teeger. Welcome back. But you never
thought you'd see this place again.

13:36.905 --> 13:39.397
- It's like a bad dream.
- It is, isn't it?

13:39.597 --> 13:40.774
The Body's over there.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.239
I told them not to move the Body
until you got here.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.022
- Where have you been?
- Art class.

13:46.072 --> 13:47.635
Right, your hobby. How's that going?

13:47.704 --> 13:49.921
Mr. Monk drew a beautiful
landscape today.

13:50.041 --> 13:50.967
Did he now?

13:51.087 --> 13:53.111
Did you put it up on the refrigerator,
mommy?

13:53.231 --> 13:55.090
Well, the teacher said it was odious.

13:55.341 --> 13:56.855
Odious. That doesn't sound good.

13:56.975 --> 14:00.526
I love it. I think he has real talent.
I believe in him.

14:00.940 --> 14:01.955
Oh, my god.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.882
Natalie, you remember Bennie Wentworth.

14:04.002 --> 14:05.754
Yeah, you can still smell the Whiskey.

14:05.874 --> 14:08.940
Looks like he got plastered and walked
into his own Booby Trap.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.937
Surprised it didn't happen years ago.

14:11.057 --> 14:13.951
Yeah, I know. What are the odds, right?
Same Junkyard, two victims,

14:14.071 --> 14:15.355
two nights running?

14:16.353 --> 14:17.509
This is wrong.

14:18.766 --> 14:20.579
I don't think he died here.

14:31.139 --> 14:32.528
It's 12 inches, right?

14:32.785 --> 14:33.671
Yeah.

14:43.332 --> 14:45.280
The knife's 48 inches off the ground.

14:45.340 --> 14:46.316
Right.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.602
That's 54 inches.

14:57.768 --> 14:58.943
It doesn't match.

15:00.452 --> 15:02.206
He was stabbed somewhere else.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.562
He was killed here.

15:23.103 --> 15:26.619
Then moved over there to the Booby Trap
to make it look like an accident.

15:27.078 --> 15:29.451
Maybe the guy who drove off
last night came back.

15:30.257 --> 15:31.894
For what? What the hell are they after?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.961
I don't know. There's something here.

15:34.144 --> 15:36.407
Something worth dying for,

15:36.874 --> 15:38.765
- or killing for.
- Here?

15:41.563 --> 15:42.740
Hey, what do you got?

15:43.989 --> 15:45.243
The log book.

15:47.128 --> 15:48.652
Looks like everything...

15:49.155 --> 15:51.381
He picked up, and everything he sold.

15:54.599 --> 15:55.718
Look.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.417
The last page is missing.

15:57.848 --> 16:00.654
- Who found the Body?
- We got an anonymous call.

16:01.217 --> 16:03.025
Figured it was, Hector, his assistant.

16:03.145 --> 16:04.715
- is he here?
- No, took off.

16:04.835 --> 16:07.303
Probably got scared.
No green card.

16:07.581 --> 16:10.012
Maybe he knows
what's on that missing page.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.018
- Find him and bring an interpreter.
- We don't need one. I can do it.

16:14.643 --> 16:15.800
You speak Spanish?

16:15.932 --> 16:18.451
Yeah. I'm brushing up.
Trying to make Captain.

16:18.571 --> 16:19.794
- You any good?
- Yeah.

16:20.186 --> 16:21.226
I'm bueno.

16:21.497 --> 16:22.962
I'm mucho bueno.

16:23.971 --> 16:26.856
I got a feeling about this
and it ain't bueno.

16:35.351 --> 16:36.566
Mr. Monk.

16:36.848 --> 16:37.631
Yes?

16:37.751 --> 16:39.678
Adrian Monk, the Painter.

16:43.298 --> 16:45.565
- Yeah.
- It is you.

16:45.779 --> 16:47.978
What a great honor, sir.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.851
Please, can I come in?

16:51.261 --> 16:52.841
Yes. Please.

16:59.963 --> 17:01.834
The smell of a genius.

17:02.149 --> 17:04.517
This must be your studio?

17:04.864 --> 17:06.277
Not really a studio.

17:06.396 --> 17:09.309
I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

17:09.732 --> 17:14.313
Petya Lovak from Rostov, near Moscow.

17:14.453 --> 17:15.619
You've been to Russia.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.328
No, I don't travel much.

17:17.659 --> 17:20.092
Axcept for up there, I presume.

17:20.452 --> 17:23.452
- You're an art dealer.
- I'm not merely an art dealer.

17:23.571 --> 17:26.714
I'm a connoisseur.
I am an enthusiast.

17:26.835 --> 17:30.515
And each and every day,
I look for new talent.

17:30.635 --> 17:34.451
Today, I was at the college,
and what did I see?

17:34.780 --> 17:38.894
I saw this
fantastic landscape you have done.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.751
Magnificent!

17:40.871 --> 17:44.970
It's a wonderful example
of outsider art.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.080
Outsider art?

17:46.200 --> 17:49.639
You see, every great moment
in history

17:49.982 --> 17:52.521
like Cubism,
surrealism,

17:52.641 --> 17:54.670
they all began as

17:54.837 --> 17:56.902
outsider
art.

17:58.697 --> 18:00.935
Is this some of your work?

18:01.249 --> 18:02.700
Do you mind if i,

18:03.114 --> 18:04.020
Please?

18:12.909 --> 18:14.240
I love this.

18:14.388 --> 18:15.603
Well...

18:18.323 --> 18:19.148
Yeah.

18:19.268 --> 18:20.731
Actually...

18:24.669 --> 18:25.904
It's a banana.

18:27.150 --> 18:28.918
It's a flat,

18:29.471 --> 18:32.336
- It's a flat banana.
- Yes. I had my assistant

18:32.604 --> 18:34.957
flatten it,
straighten it.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.980
A flat banana.

18:42.249 --> 18:43.463
I get it.

18:43.676 --> 18:44.930
I love it.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.592
I want it.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.341
- You want to buy it?
- Yes, I give you $300 cash.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.006
And I'll take it right away.

18:52.126 --> 18:54.684
- 300?
- Let's make it 500.

18:54.804 --> 18:56.404
And this one too.

18:56.524 --> 18:59.345
- I must have this.
- No no, that one doesn't count.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.747
I messed it up.
That.

19:01.988 --> 19:03.398
It's just a swoosh.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.485
No.

19:04.765 --> 19:05.807
Mr. Monk.

19:06.263 --> 19:09.055
Let me tell you.
You say more with one swoosh

19:09.175 --> 19:12.431
than most artists say
with a million swoosh.

19:13.773 --> 19:15.317
Just look at this.

19:15.981 --> 19:17.466
From a distance.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.260
Eternity dives.

19:22.810 --> 19:23.737
Brilliant!

19:24.043 --> 19:24.911
There!

19:25.080 --> 19:26.002
So...

19:26.540 --> 19:28.334
Can I propose to you...

19:29.379 --> 19:33.739
Thousand dollars...
For both those pieces?

19:34.843 --> 19:36.250
Do we have a deal?

19:40.859 --> 19:42.904
I don't usually shake hands, but...

19:44.931 --> 19:45.970
I thank you.

19:46.090 --> 19:47.149
Mr. Monk.

19:47.558 --> 19:50.047
You are a true
revelation.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.207
And I would like the world to know it.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.769
I don't know what to say.

19:55.935 --> 19:57.401
Don't say anything.

19:57.904 --> 20:00.008
Just paint, paint, paint!

20:00.450 --> 20:02.398
And when you can't paint anymore,

20:03.138 --> 20:05.279
just continue painting.

20:10.211 --> 20:13.240
<i>Es que usted tiene que creerme.
Yo no sé dónde esti.</i>

20:13.627 --> 20:16.048
<i>Ya van como
tres samanas que no lo he visto.</i>

20:16.430 --> 20:18.803
<i>Tal vez se regres a México, no si.</i>

20:19.150 --> 20:22.275
She said,
usted tiene.

20:22.869 --> 20:23.950
But she never.

20:24.870 --> 20:26.047
Creerme,

20:26.240 --> 20:27.224
it's...

20:30.046 --> 20:33.443
- She said she hasn't seen him.
- Just tell her he's not in trouble,

20:33.563 --> 20:36.045
we're not from the INS,
we just want to talk to him.

20:36.349 --> 20:37.243
Okay.

20:38.025 --> 20:40.649
Usted es un marinero triste.

20:44.961 --> 20:47.307
She's pretending she doesn't understand.

20:48.223 --> 20:49.226
Hey, Hector.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.120
Hector, it's Leland Stottlemeyer.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.652
Come on out, son.
We're not from the INS.

20:55.772 --> 20:58.695
Hector, we just want to find out
what happened to Bennie.

20:59.289 --> 21:00.466
No INS.

21:05.355 --> 21:06.551
Ayudenos.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.619
Ayudenos, ayudenos.

21:11.526 --> 21:12.311
Hola.

21:12.431 --> 21:13.255
Hey...

21:15.269 --> 21:16.562
Can you help us?

21:17.237 --> 21:18.269
Look.

21:23.946 --> 21:25.282
The page is missing.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.183
Can you help us find out
what was on that page?

21:28.303 --> 21:30.052
- Can you show us?
- Si.

21:30.314 --> 21:31.533
- Si.
- Yes.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.640
Yes.

21:34.682 --> 21:35.838
Thank you, Randy.

22:00.882 --> 22:01.924
Hello.

22:02.326 --> 22:05.165
- So how's it going?
- Hush a art.

22:05.630 --> 22:06.691
Mr. Monk.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.055
Where's all my stuff?

22:09.175 --> 22:11.520
Out back.
It was distracting me.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.680
- Well, what if it rains?
- Then your stuff will get wet.

22:14.979 --> 22:18.314
Art requires a little sacrifice,
Natalie.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.297
Wait-my curtains?

22:20.417 --> 22:22.656
I took them down
because I needed the light.

22:22.776 --> 22:23.902
Eastern light.

22:24.534 --> 22:25.685
C'est finis.

22:25.805 --> 22:26.743
Take a look.

22:31.395 --> 22:32.610
What do you think?

22:34.835 --> 22:37.290
- Well, the Captain's gonna love it.
- Why?

22:37.869 --> 22:39.586
Well, it.
It's him, right?

22:39.910 --> 22:41.839
No.
It's you!

22:42.533 --> 22:43.533
Me?!

22:44.858 --> 22:46.228
But, she.

22:48.349 --> 22:51.386
- I have a moustache.
- It's a shadow. Natalie.

22:52.749 --> 22:54.717
This is my masterpiece.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.551
Take it.

22:58.959 --> 23:00.329
I want you to have it.

23:00.496 --> 23:02.406
Wait. Wait wait.

23:06.816 --> 23:07.723
There.

23:08.448 --> 23:10.261
Now Julie can go to college.

23:10.381 --> 23:11.538
Mr. Monk, is.

23:11.965 --> 23:14.240
Is that really how you see me?

23:16.141 --> 23:17.820
You're a beautiful woman.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.578
Hey hey, Picasso!

23:21.416 --> 23:23.278
- Hey!
- Look at you.

23:23.975 --> 23:25.229
You're really into it.

23:26.609 --> 23:28.245
I mean, you're really into it.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.721
Who is that, Jimmy Buffet?

23:29.841 --> 23:31.857
No, that's Miss Piggy, right?

23:32.092 --> 23:33.650
Looks like he's eating something.

23:33.770 --> 23:35.707
- What's the. What's that?
- It's me!

23:44.444 --> 23:45.436
And I love it.

23:45.556 --> 23:48.265
Okay, you have to look at it
with fresh eyes.

23:49.576 --> 23:50.576
Fresh eyes?

23:50.762 --> 23:51.762
Like this?

23:54.154 --> 23:56.585
So you take it all in,
all at once. Try it.

23:57.317 --> 23:58.320
Try it!

24:03.984 --> 24:06.048
Now you open your hands.
You have to open your hands.

24:06.087 --> 24:07.192
Gimme a minute.

24:12.294 --> 24:13.876
Okay, yeah, I see it now.

24:14.368 --> 24:15.273
It's good.

24:15.341 --> 24:17.983
Yeah, Monk, listen,
we've got Hector Morales in the car.

24:18.003 --> 24:19.351
We wanna drive him around.

24:19.471 --> 24:23.084
Yeah, we're gonna retrace the route
that Hector and Bennie took last week.

24:23.104 --> 24:25.929
Yeah, it should only take
a couple of days.

24:25.987 --> 24:28.281
- We figured you'd wanna come along.
- I'll pass.

24:29.286 --> 24:30.314
You'll pass?

24:30.374 --> 24:31.473
Yeah, I'm too busy.

24:31.558 --> 24:33.361
I have big art show tomorrow
at the college.

24:33.381 --> 24:36.147
Monk! We've got two victims here,
the case is fresh.

24:36.186 --> 24:39.478
- I think it's kind of a priority to.
- This is kind of a priority to me.

24:40.009 --> 24:41.688
No, it's not. This is a hobby.

24:41.863 --> 24:44.535
Not anymore.
It was a hobby when I started.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.551
You mean thursday.

24:46.571 --> 24:48.233
He sold two paintings.

24:48.985 --> 24:49.892
Deux.

24:50.546 --> 24:51.453
To who?

24:52.370 --> 24:53.316
Hello?

24:53.451 --> 24:56.538
- I'm sorry, am I disturbing you?
- Mr. Lovak, come in.

24:56.611 --> 24:59.020
You should put sign up,
"genius at work."

24:59.295 --> 25:00.722
These are my friends.

25:00.829 --> 25:02.777
Petya Lovak, Natalie Teeger.

25:02.797 --> 25:04.512
Miss Teeger.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.483
You must be his muse.

25:07.242 --> 25:09.306
It would explain everything.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.186
Leland Stottlemeyer and Randy Disher.

25:12.248 --> 25:13.271
Petya Lovak.

25:14.153 --> 25:15.135
Gentlemen.

25:15.193 --> 25:17.701
I hope you're not here to outbid me.

25:19.747 --> 25:21.097
Look at that.

25:21.408 --> 25:22.720
Are these new?

25:27.278 --> 25:28.474
Mr. Monk.

25:28.804 --> 25:33.737
It is as if art never existed before
and you reinvented it.

25:33.757 --> 25:34.635
Right.

25:35.194 --> 25:40.056
I'll... Take both of them for...
$1,200.

25:40.403 --> 25:43.779
- And I will hang them.
- in my villa in Monte Carlo.

25:43.973 --> 25:46.346
You're-you're gonna
put them up where you live?

25:51.803 --> 25:53.848
I've never seen this.

25:54.789 --> 25:56.544
How much is big woman?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.486
Sorry, that's not for sale.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.199
I just gave it to Natalie as a gift.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.136
No no no.

26:03.213 --> 26:04.853
A... Thousand dollars.

26:05.571 --> 26:06.574
Pardon me?

26:07.160 --> 26:10.536
I'm sorry, $2,000!
I must have this painting.

26:15.634 --> 26:17.467
I can't. I'm sorry.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.908
It was a gift, i'm sorry.

26:23.355 --> 26:25.284
You have no idea how sorry...

26:26.094 --> 26:27.406
I really am.

26:28.088 --> 26:29.321
You sure?

26:30.127 --> 26:31.362
Are you sure?

26:31.417 --> 26:32.787
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:33.823 --> 26:34.595
Okay.

26:35.496 --> 26:37.156
I'll give you my card

26:37.234 --> 26:40.495
just in case you change your mind.

26:40.515 --> 26:44.346
Mr. Monk, would you please help me with
the paintings to my van?

26:44.409 --> 26:46.627
Of course. Would you hold that, please?

26:46.685 --> 26:47.804
Miss Teeger.

26:49.248 --> 26:51.004
Until we meet again.

26:51.115 --> 26:53.484
Gentlemen.
It was a pleasure.

26:53.561 --> 26:54.485
Yeah.

26:55.014 --> 26:55.959
Truly.

27:01.542 --> 27:02.685
Is this real?

27:03.427 --> 27:04.758
What do you think?

27:14.801 --> 27:16.832
Adrian, we only have an hour.

27:17.055 --> 27:18.425
Don't move.

27:19.045 --> 27:20.511
It's almost done.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.962
You know, while we have a moment,

27:25.023 --> 27:27.705
my assistant said that
you did not bring a check today.

27:30.131 --> 27:31.810
This should take care of it.

27:32.148 --> 27:33.750
That oughta cover us till June.

27:35.244 --> 27:36.832
Yes, well,

27:36.960 --> 27:40.219
thank you for this.
I, I hope you're not insulted,

27:40.239 --> 27:42.166
but I think I'd rather have the check.

27:42.531 --> 27:43.554
Really?

27:45.764 --> 27:49.782
You know I could sell that piece tonight
for $3,000.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.709
And I-and I think that's great,
i'm really proud of you, Adrian.

27:52.767 --> 27:55.672
But, you know, when I suggested
that you take up a hobby,

27:56.873 --> 27:59.699
- I never expected.
- Me to succeed.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.300
No, no, no. That is not what I meant.

28:02.356 --> 28:05.111
Trudy always said
I had the soul of an artist.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.793
And I agree with Trudy.

28:07.428 --> 28:10.544
See, I always felt that your detective
work was your art,

28:10.583 --> 28:12.571
the way you analyze a crime scene.

28:12.660 --> 28:16.893
I did too, I did too.
But now, I've sold these paintings.

28:17.408 --> 28:21.614
Something that I created
is out there on somebody's wall

28:22.099 --> 28:24.074
being admired. I'm invigor.

28:24.094 --> 28:27.055
I feel invigorated. I'm invigorated.

28:29.339 --> 28:31.156
Who knows what else I can do?

28:32.083 --> 28:34.315
You sold five paintings?

28:34.923 --> 28:36.949
That's right. That's right.

28:37.052 --> 28:40.252
But all-all to the same man,
this Mr. Lovak.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.920
What-what do you know about him?

28:41.972 --> 28:46.219
He's from a little town called Rostov,
which is near Moscow.

28:46.748 --> 28:48.555
His family owns an oil refinery.

28:48.808 --> 28:51.681
But petya is more interested

28:51.990 --> 28:53.707
in collecting fine art.

28:53.825 --> 28:55.697
If you'd like to meet him...

28:56.659 --> 28:59.533
There's an exhibit at my art
school this very afternoon.

28:59.744 --> 29:01.615
Sorry, I, Maybe

29:01.692 --> 29:03.795
another time. But you know what?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.012
Our time is up.

29:06.092 --> 29:10.087
And I am afraid i'm going
to have to ask you for that check.

29:11.725 --> 29:13.326
Are you sure?

29:14.614 --> 29:17.048
<i>El martes en la manana, paramos aqul.</i>

29:17.168 --> 29:19.569
<i>Encontramos una mesa y tres sillas.</i>

29:19.628 --> 29:21.125
<i>Las pusimos en El Carro.</i>

29:22.814 --> 29:25.091
Tuesday morning,
he said he was here with Bennie,

29:25.122 --> 29:28.651
They found a table
and a delicious bamboo salad.

29:29.749 --> 29:31.157
A bamboo salad.

29:32.309 --> 29:33.801
I think he's hiding something too.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.482
I think you're hiding something.

29:35.921 --> 29:38.784
And where did you go-
Where did he go next?

29:38.823 --> 29:42.870
Adonde.
Adonde, adonde usted.

29:43.737 --> 29:46.206
- Adonde usted.
- Where do we go next?

29:46.464 --> 29:48.369
Adonde. Can you show me?

29:48.424 --> 29:49.716
<i>- Si, vamos.</i>
- Okay.

30:09.497 --> 30:10.865
God.

30:17.019 --> 30:18.616
It's a very common name.

30:26.995 --> 30:28.151
How are we doing?

30:29.201 --> 30:31.362
Look at them.
Sad, really.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.386
Don't know who they're all
trying to impress.

30:36.487 --> 30:39.024
It's pathetic. They're pathetic.
But we shouldn't laugh.

30:39.044 --> 30:41.274
No, Mr. Monk, it's you, look at you.

30:41.353 --> 30:43.804
Where did you get this? Oh, my gosh.

30:43.881 --> 30:45.443
And a beret?

30:45.770 --> 30:48.192
Now-now it's crooked, I can feel it.

30:48.212 --> 30:50.380
No, Mr. Monk, it's supposed
to be crooked, here.

30:50.620 --> 30:53.317
- Stop it. That goes this way.
- Just a little.

30:53.337 --> 30:55.623
- Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
- Just a little.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.895
Petya must be running late.
Yeah, Mr. Monk,

30:57.915 --> 31:00.792
I've been doing a little research on
your friend Pety a I googled him.

31:00.847 --> 31:03.774
At least I tried to,
and there's no record of him anywhere.

31:03.819 --> 31:05.796
Natalie, people like Petya.

31:05.816 --> 31:08.054
Important people, wealthy people.

31:08.227 --> 31:10.060
They are un-google-able.

31:10.269 --> 31:14.062
No, Mr. Monk, it doesn't work like that.
It's not like an unlisted phone number.

31:14.082 --> 31:15.299
Un-google-able!

31:15.557 --> 31:16.811
End of discussion.

31:16.929 --> 31:19.564
Adrian Monk.
My star student.

31:19.584 --> 31:20.784
Ms. Benson.

31:21.155 --> 31:23.066
This is my friend, Natalie Teeger.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.041
Natalie was very supportive of me
when I was...

31:26.139 --> 31:28.354
Still struggling.
Before...

31:28.662 --> 31:30.614
- I sold anything.
- Yes, yes.

31:30.664 --> 31:33.012
Well, we've all
heard about your success.

31:33.032 --> 31:34.947
It's the talk of the school. It's.

31:34.967 --> 31:38.137
Quite extraordinary, yes, I know.
Excuse me, here he is.

31:38.316 --> 31:40.091
Petya! Petya.

31:40.186 --> 31:41.824
I'm so glad you could make it.

31:41.906 --> 31:44.443
Mr. Monk, I wouldn't have
missed it for all the world.

31:44.463 --> 31:45.787
I'm sure you don't remember.

31:45.807 --> 31:49.884
The alluring Miss teeger.
Have you reconsidered your decision,

31:49.904 --> 31:51.464
About selling your portrait?

31:51.559 --> 31:54.135
- I'm afraid not.
- What a pity!

31:54.203 --> 31:57.364
My collection of Monk
will always be incomplete.

31:57.384 --> 31:59.712
And this is my instructor, ms. Benson.

31:59.809 --> 32:03.127
You must be so proud
of your disciple here.

32:03.184 --> 32:06.147
I think astonished would be
a more accurate word.

32:06.179 --> 32:07.179
Thank you.

32:07.215 --> 32:10.657
I know you came here to see Adrian,
but there's so much interesting work

32:10.677 --> 32:11.965
being done at the school.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.182
<i>For example, over there.</i>

32:14.575 --> 32:16.813
And,
well, look.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.791
Here's one example. This is mine.

32:20.323 --> 32:22.793
I call it
marriage.

32:22.828 --> 32:25.162
<i>No, no, I'm sorry, not even close.</i>

32:25.191 --> 32:27.371
The lines are all squiggly.

32:27.521 --> 32:30.328
You have to make them straighter.
Try using a ruler.

32:30.455 --> 32:31.499
A ruler?

32:31.519 --> 32:33.551
You told me you had two new paintings.

32:33.571 --> 32:35.631
Well, on this side, right over here.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.136
- Stop!
- Snowman.

32:46.274 --> 32:47.739
What is this?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.888
There's, like, tiny punctures
here in the middle.

32:50.908 --> 32:52.859
Yeah, I used a compass.

32:54.148 --> 32:55.479
Yes.

32:55.730 --> 32:56.946
Of course.

32:57.061 --> 32:59.762
And I love it.
I must have it.

33:01.332 --> 33:03.261
And I will take this too.

33:03.893 --> 33:05.109
<i>It's an egg in a nest.</i>

33:05.166 --> 33:07.636
<i>Of course, it is an egg in a nest.</i>

33:08.706 --> 33:10.807
So, together...

33:12.498 --> 33:13.887
$4,000.

33:14.195 --> 33:15.791
- Okay.
- Anything else?

33:16.019 --> 33:18.172
- Yes, I have some sketches.
- No no.

33:18.192 --> 33:20.690
I'm more interested in your paintings.

33:20.759 --> 33:22.774
That's where your genius lies.

33:22.794 --> 33:23.589
I agree.

33:23.685 --> 33:27.720
My van is outside, do you think
someone can help me with the paintings?

33:27.740 --> 33:28.742
I'll do it.

33:28.962 --> 33:30.892
Careful. Careful.

33:34.469 --> 33:37.131
I haven't given up on your portrait.

33:42.124 --> 33:43.223
Art supplies.

33:43.281 --> 33:45.469
My uncle died suddenly
about three weeks ago.

33:45.542 --> 33:47.820
Heart attack.
I've been cleaning out his house

33:47.864 --> 33:50.398
and I put a bunch of his stuff
by the curb monday night.

33:50.418 --> 33:51.913
What kind of art supplies?

33:52.075 --> 33:54.156
Some paints, a few blank canvases,

33:54.176 --> 33:56.541
and one of my uncle's paintings
that he never finished.

33:56.561 --> 33:57.639
Blank canvases.

33:57.697 --> 33:59.919
Miss larson, can we take a look inside?

34:00.264 --> 34:01.209
Thank you.

34:03.129 --> 34:04.614
Over here.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.848
Careful.
I'll take it from here.

34:10.005 --> 34:11.393
Thank you.

34:13.188 --> 34:16.123
- Are-are those all my... Paintings?
- I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.949
I have one more stop, and then
i'm heading for the airport.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.498
You're leaving, really?

34:20.518 --> 34:21.737
- Please-
- Maybe,

34:21.786 --> 34:24.681
Maybe we should wrap them up. You know.
I could find a sheet.

34:24.701 --> 34:28.447
- They'll be fine. Don't worry about it.
- Good-bye. Good-bye, good-bye.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.203
- I'm saying good-bye to my paintings.
- Seriously Mr. Monk hurry.

34:31.223 --> 34:34.922
When you Hang them, make sure
they're straight. Use a level.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.440
Yes, yes.

34:37.348 --> 34:38.891
Sorry.

34:41.099 --> 34:42.429
Das Vidhanya.

34:58.662 --> 35:00.938
Was your uncle a professional painter?

35:00.996 --> 35:02.296
No, it was just a hobby.

35:02.316 --> 35:04.493
He took it up late in life
just a few years ago.

35:04.513 --> 35:05.613
Was he any good?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.873
I didn't think so, to be honest.

35:08.165 --> 35:11.558
But he did sell a lot of his paintings.
To a collector from Russia.

35:12.997 --> 35:14.114
From Russia?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.489
Do you remember his name?

35:16.983 --> 35:17.952
I never met him.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.660
But I think he bought all of them.
Except for the last one.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.652
The one uncle Scott was working
on when he died.

35:22.672 --> 35:24.799
That's the one you put out by the curb.

35:28.787 --> 35:30.545
- Is this your uncle?
- Yeah.

35:30.575 --> 35:32.485
What does he have to do with
carson paper?

35:32.655 --> 35:34.182
He worked there for 30 years.

35:34.221 --> 35:35.706
What's Carson paper?

35:36.763 --> 35:40.447
Carson paper has a contract with
the US Treasury. They make Money.

35:41.512 --> 35:43.480
Or at least the paper it's printed on.

35:50.059 --> 35:51.333
<i>Adrian!</i>

35:52.365 --> 35:54.370
Congratulations.

35:54.618 --> 35:55.852
I must be honest.

35:55.984 --> 36:00.131
At first, I didn't appreciate your style
but I see it now.

36:00.258 --> 36:01.820
You are deconstructing

36:01.896 --> 36:05.009
the aesthetic orthodoxy
that most artists, myself included.

36:05.029 --> 36:06.704
- Where's Natalie?
- She went home.

36:06.757 --> 36:10.017
She took her portrait with her,
which I love, by the way.

36:10.245 --> 36:12.045
Just took me a while to get it.

36:16.046 --> 36:17.435
Are you all right?

36:20.461 --> 36:22.421
There was another painting in that van.

36:24.034 --> 36:25.809
I've seen it somewhere before.

36:29.376 --> 36:30.571
In the Junkyard.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.510
It was there...

36:33.112 --> 36:36.662
<i>On thursday, and the next day,
it was gone.</i>

36:49.315 --> 36:50.413
God.

36:53.082 --> 36:54.219
These are awful.

36:55.325 --> 36:56.232
<i>Monk.</i>

36:57.039 --> 36:59.074
- I'm terrible.
- Adrian monk.

37:00.137 --> 37:00.986
Monk.

37:01.143 --> 37:02.638
Where's your friend, the Russian?

37:02.658 --> 37:05.194
What, what. He just left.
What's going on?

37:05.214 --> 37:06.978
I just spoke with the secret service.

37:07.613 --> 37:09.581
Lovak is with the Russian mob.

37:09.613 --> 37:12.620
They've been counterfeiting
US Currency using real paper.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.162
Yeah, a guy named Scott Larson.
He used to work at the US Mint.

37:15.182 --> 37:17.460
He's been smuggling paper
out of the factory for years.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.725
Guess how they're getting it
past customs.

37:21.060 --> 37:22.063
Canvases?

37:22.189 --> 37:23.603
And they're not real canvases.

37:23.623 --> 37:25.647
It's eight or nine layers
of Currency paper.

37:25.685 --> 37:28.547
Larson used acrylic paint,
which peels right off.

37:28.605 --> 37:30.007
They were worth a fortune.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.306
So, it was all about the Canvases?

37:35.499 --> 37:37.235
He didn't care what was on them.

37:37.286 --> 37:39.582
I knew it had to be something.

37:39.641 --> 37:41.165
He really does suck!

37:41.756 --> 37:44.654
- Monk, did he take all the Canvases?
- Except for one.

37:47.947 --> 37:48.914
Natalie.

37:51.938 --> 37:53.403
Miss Teeger.

37:55.059 --> 37:57.447
Mr. Lovak, I already told you.
I'm not interested.

37:57.582 --> 38:01.221
You know what I like about you?
You are a tough cookie.

38:01.766 --> 38:03.445
My final offer.

38:04.519 --> 38:07.008
An additional thousand dollars.

38:07.068 --> 38:08.385
All together,

38:08.476 --> 38:11.891
3,500.

38:12.032 --> 38:13.247
What do you say?

38:15.790 --> 38:18.552
Look, I can't.
It was a gift from my boss. I can't.

38:18.761 --> 38:21.443
Well, obviously,
you don't care about it.

38:21.968 --> 38:25.508
You have it hiding in the corner behind
a big bush.

38:26.444 --> 38:30.698
I understand, you're embarrassed
about it. Right?

38:31.569 --> 38:34.965
So let me help you
take it off of your shoulders.

38:36.501 --> 38:38.254
Look, I can't.
It would hurt his feelings.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.573
Look here, Miss Teeger.

38:40.454 --> 38:42.243
I'm going to take that painting...

38:43.198 --> 38:45.359
Whether you sell it to me or not.

38:45.455 --> 38:46.806
You really like it.

38:49.072 --> 38:50.596
I hate it.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.596
It is an abomination.

38:52.616 --> 38:54.062
It's horrible.

38:56.603 --> 38:57.841
Nonetheless,

38:58.870 --> 39:01.648
I'm gonna leave
with that painting.

39:02.229 --> 39:05.731
And you're gonna stand there
very still.

39:09.177 --> 39:10.682
<i>Petya Lovak!</i>

39:10.895 --> 39:12.284
<i>I know you're in there!</i>

39:14.776 --> 39:15.779
Monk!

39:16.376 --> 39:18.074
You can't come in here.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.732
I've got your little friend.

39:21.204 --> 39:23.712
<i>I've got something of yours too.</i>

39:27.548 --> 39:28.513
Hey!

39:28.911 --> 39:30.937
What are you doing?

39:31.166 --> 39:32.652
It's all over, Petya!

39:33.230 --> 39:34.213
Let her go!

39:34.317 --> 39:35.340
No no!

39:35.468 --> 39:36.614
Those are.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.869
Those are your own paintings.
You wouldn't do that.

39:39.984 --> 39:41.795
- You're an artist.
- Too late.

39:42.321 --> 39:43.633
I stink and I know it.

39:43.691 --> 39:45.408
No no no no! No!

39:45.659 --> 39:47.550
<i>What are you doing?</i>

39:48.187 --> 39:50.463
No! You're crazy!

39:50.499 --> 39:53.472
They are worth a fortune!
No!

39:58.529 --> 40:00.470
Get him, Captain.
Get him down!

40:01.416 --> 40:04.617
<i>Give me your hands!</i>
<i>Gimme the hands! Come on.</i>

40:07.448 --> 40:09.490
Petya Lovak, you are under arrest

40:09.510 --> 40:13.030
<i>for capital murder,
conspiracy to counterfeit.</i>

40:13.160 --> 40:15.340
Hope you got a good lawyer.

40:25.434 --> 40:26.793
Alright, see you shortly.

40:28.741 --> 40:32.650
Nathalie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?!

40:34.378 --> 40:36.172
It's evidence!

40:36.499 --> 40:39.374
Secret Service are on their way.
It's the only painting we have left.

40:40.455 --> 40:42.811
- It's gonna be exibit A.
- Exibit A?

40:42.831 --> 40:45.098
Yeah. It's big news, Nathalie.

40:46.007 --> 40:48.611
It's gonna be
one of the famous painting in the world.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.167
You're right. You're right, I am sorry.

40:57.996 --> 41:00.052
- Burn it! <i>Burn it!</i>
- Give me that!

41:00.130 --> 41:02.796
- Grab that painting.
- Burn it!

41:02.836 --> 41:05.213
Who is the first victim?
The guy in the Junkyard.

41:05.233 --> 41:09.178
A russian goom named Kenni Stasia,
he's one of Petya's lap dogs

41:09.249 --> 41:11.147
He was trying to steal the Canvases?

41:11.168 --> 41:14.074
Your friend Patrick came back the
following night, but it was too late.

41:14.094 --> 41:17.153
You already had the canvases
and you were already painting.

41:17.445 --> 41:19.818
- And all that money he gave me?
- Conterfeit.

41:19.889 --> 41:21.509
We're gonna need it back.

41:21.569 --> 41:23.537
What was I thinking? I'm no artist.

41:24.076 --> 41:25.350
You're no artist?

41:25.752 --> 41:27.778
Adrian Monk, you're a grand master.

41:28.463 --> 41:30.334
Leonardo de Vinci, or...

41:30.422 --> 41:32.762
- Pablo Picaso.
- Just not with a paint brush.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.414
Not with a paint brush,
that's for damn sure

41:35.513 --> 41:38.127
Hey, how about stamp collector?
That's a nice hoby.

41:38.324 --> 41:42.047
You get a little book, you put on the
stamps in there, you line them all up.

41:42.128 --> 41:44.703
- Could arrange them by color it close.
- Yes, you could.

41:44.761 --> 41:46.717
You could arrange them
any way you'd like.

41:46.742 --> 41:48.247
It's a hobby, after all.

41:48.282 --> 41:51.608
- They're all the same size?
- If that's important to you, yes.
