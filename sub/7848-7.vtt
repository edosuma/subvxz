20:51.133 --> 20:52.233
BIG MOUTH.

20:52.233 --> 20:56.200
WELL, THEN GIVE
HIM THIS FOR ME.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.066
MADELINE.
STILL THIRSTY.

21:01.567 --> 21:02.667
HERE YOU GO.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.834
OH, I HAVE MONEY.
I WANT A SODA.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.834
NO, THIS IS THE MONEY
I OWE YOU.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.767
AND NOW I'M FREE!

21:09.767 --> 21:13.400
I'M FREE!
I'M FREE AT LAST!

21:14.233 --> 21:16.700
BUT WE WERE HAVING
SO MUCH FUN.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.100
YOU WERE HAVING FUN.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.767
I WAS WATCHING YOU
HAVE FUN.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.900
BUT WHAT COULD BE MORE FUN?

21:21.900 --> 21:24.133
A ROOT CANAL
YOU DON'T NEED?

21:24.133 --> 21:26.600
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.233
I LOANED YOU MONEY.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.467
LONDON, MONEY CAN'T
BUY YOU FRIENDS.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.700
YOU MAKE FRIENDS BY
BEING NICE TO PEOPLE.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.567
BUT THAT SEEMS HARDER.

21:33.567 --> 21:34.100
NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.600
IT'S REALLY EASY TO SAY
NICE THINGS TO PEOPLE.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.400
WATCH.
LONDON, YOU ARE...

21:39.400 --> 21:41.500
UH...

21:41.500 --> 21:42.567
YES?

21:42.567 --> 21:44.300
THIS IS HARD.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.100
OH, WAIT. GOT ONE.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.567
DEEP DOWN, I SUSPECT
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.867
AWWW. THANK YOU.

21:52.867 --> 21:55.667
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY
SOMETHING NICE BACK.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.233
I SAID THANK YOU.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.066
YOU'RE WELCOME.
