Look,ajogger

14:37.252 --> 14:38.583
-She makes it.
-Makes what?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.955
And a kid on a bike, no helmet.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.968
-You're stuck in my second...
-Second favorite Bill Murray movie.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.970
See? We had this conversation.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.927
-And Duke died?
-Yeah.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.477
Would have been something to see.

15:00.609 --> 15:01.644
Ow.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.894
You know what? You were there,
and you were pretty upset about it.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.229
So this time,
I didn't give Duke the rent money.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.736
And Chris is there.
He's keeping him busy, so Duke will be safe.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.157
So whose trouble is this?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.654
Well, at first, I thought it was the victim's,

15:12.788 --> 15:14.824
but the victims changed, and then Duke died.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.907
Maybe it's the driver, doomed to relive
the moment they kill somebody.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.743
Yeah, but it was a hit-and-run driver, okay?
We don't even know the driver,

15:20.837 --> 15:23.089
and the accident didn't happen
in the same exact spot.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.663
Well, we know the general area.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.749
We know the time. We set up a checkpoint.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.424
-We catch the driver.
-No.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.673
We'll find a way to stop this.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.678
Together.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.926
But what if this happens again?

15:34.017 --> 15:38.681
-And then you forget everything I've told you.
-Then you'll tell me again.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.936
Why did you bring me to school?

15:44.194 --> 15:48.028
Because I can't check every kid
for green shoes by myself.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.363
I've never seen so many kids' feet in my life.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.786
Well, even if the victim changed,
we still had to cover our bases, you know.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.988
It was worth a shot.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.116
And you're in the area
where you found Duke?

16:00.210 --> 16:02.041
Yeah. It's all clear.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.959
Okay. Remember to keep your eyes peeled

16:06.049 --> 16:09.212
because the accident happened
right after the church bells at noon.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.135
Not making many friends,
but it's pretty quiet around here.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.383
Maybe it's not going to happen today.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.988
I'm okay.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.312
Nathan?

16:30.657 --> 16:31.863

16:34.536 --> 16:35.901

16:39.499 --> 16:40.534
No.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.074
All right.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.754
Can somebody call 911?
We have an officer down!

16:48.925 --> 16:53.089
Beige sedan, male, older, medium build.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.591
I didn't get a plate.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.345
This is kind of strange.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.522
I'm not going to let you die, okay?

17:05.609 --> 17:08.851
Do you understand me?
Stop it. Do you understand?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.401
I'm going to fix this.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.403
It doesn't hurt.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.570
The only thing I feel is you.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.281
No.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.117
No.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.287
No! No!

17:38.642 --> 17:39.802
Oh, thank God.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.386
Wow, I guess I did something right last night.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.224
Hey, you're hurt.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.734
What happened?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.654
Everybody else resets, but I'm still hurt.

17:56.159 --> 18:00.448
That means I keep my injuries, so if I die...

18:00.747 --> 18:02.408
No, you're in shock.
We got to get that looked at.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.831
No,no,no,no,no,no.
You don't understand. I think...

18:06.753 --> 18:10.166
I think I might be the only one
that can stop this.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.674
If something happens to me,
then this might never end.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.010
We could be stuck in this day forever.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.522
-Okay. Here's your shirt.
-Thank you.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.109
What's going on?
'Cause that stuff you were saying...

18:30.193 --> 18:32.434
I'm sorry.
I don't have time to explain, all right?

18:32.529 --> 18:35.191
I know that you made plans,
and lwish I could do that picnic thing,

18:35.282 --> 18:36.613
but I can't.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.443
I need you to do something for me.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.531
-l'm going to hate this, right?
-Definitely.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.364
Okay, okay.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.619
-Chris Brody.
-First, I'll get you your rent tomorrow.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.670
Second, yes,
Chris and l are sleeping together.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.460
-Yeah.
-Third, don't do payroll today.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.668
-I hate payroll. But you know what I do like?
-Money, yeah.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.635
-l was going to say, Chris Brody.
-Okay.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.218
Okay, Chris has something
that he wants to tell you.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.806
Thank you.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.398
-What's up, Chris?
-I hear you make a mean waffle.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.736
-The secret is in the maple syrup.
-Right.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.813
Come on, I'll show you.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.208

19:36.593 --> 19:37.753
Since you're here, can you...

19:44.351 --> 19:46.342
I'd just give it a minute.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.105
What?

19:58.865 --> 20:03.700
-And then, I died?
-Yeah, but something else happened.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.783
I got hurt. And it's still here today.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.574
l was helping you because you had been...

20:11.961 --> 20:13.292
Yeah, and...

20:13.380 --> 20:15.211
But obviously, you know,
you're in one piece.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.539
But I'm still hurt.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.629
Which means that if I die, then...

20:23.473 --> 20:24.588
Then I die.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.972
And if that happens and...

20:27.310 --> 20:29.767
What is it? Is this an endless time loop?

20:30.271 --> 20:31.807
That's not going to happen.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.936
Let's find our hit-and-run driver.

with green shoes, just in case.

every one we find.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.750
There's one last thing.

21:01.845 --> 21:07.511
Every time I try to stop the accident,
I change things and people die.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.179
It's like the butterfly effect,
and I'm the butterfly.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.180
That means you don't go downtown.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.183
No way. But we're already
changing things by talking about them.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.147
I've already seen you die once.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.947

21:25.869 --> 21:27.951

how many cars we booted today.

Okay, what about the car?
We boot and impound...

28:32.086 --> 28:35.078
No, I already tried that.
He got a different car. It was a blue one.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.756
The accident happened later,
but it still happened. Well, at least...

28:39.343 --> 28:42.176
At least this way,
I know what car we're looking for.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.504
No, I am doing things different this time.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.845
Anson Shumway,
he's the key to stopping all this.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.551
His trouble's causing the day to repeat.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.058
Anson may not be responsible
for the accidents,

28:53.149 --> 28:56.141
but I think his OCD makes him feel like he is.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.069
So his guilt...
I think his guilt is what triggers his reset.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.772
So he goes back to the beginning
of the day to make it right,

29:02.867 --> 29:04.653
but when he goes back,
he takes it all with him.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.450
And you're the only one
who knows it's happening.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.702
So you're the only one that can stop it.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.283
Lucky you.

29:14.795 --> 29:18.413
l have been up for five days,
or whatever these are.

29:19.175 --> 29:23.509
l have seen my friends die,
and l was almost killed the last time.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.218
What if I fail, huh?
What if this thing, itjust keeps on going?

29:29.727 --> 29:31.592
That's not going to happen.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.979
That's what you said the last time.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.274
Well, I bet I meant it then, too.

29:40.154 --> 29:44.238
Chief, Shumway's credit card got a hit.
Portside Sporting Goods.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.990
-What'd he buy?
-They're sending through a picture now.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.332
I know what he bought. Green tennis shoes.

30:00.091 --> 30:01.797
I think I know what happened.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.461
Anson wanted to see his daughter
on her birthday,

30:06.555 --> 30:08.295
and he wanted to surprise her with the shoes.

30:13.771 --> 30:16.513
His OCD is what kept him
from crossing the street.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.432
Jeanie must have seen her father.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.654
She crossed the street alone.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.990
She was his first victim.

30:28.244 --> 30:31.361
Unless we stop this,
she's going to die all over again.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.374
Was anybody able to warn Berta or Jeanie?

30:40.464 --> 30:43.126
No, school's already out for the day,
and we've been trying Berta's phone.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.879
She's not picking up. We'll find them.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.461
Thank you for trusting me.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.263
This may be my last chance.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.300
Parker? Parker, are you still there?

30:54.770 --> 30:56.351
I found Anson Shumway.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.598
Be careful, Parker.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.316
I got to go.

31:06.115 --> 31:10.028
Mr. Shumway, I need you
to get in the car with me now, please.

31:10.119 --> 31:11.905
You can't harass me, all right?

31:11.996 --> 31:14.783
-l have every right...
-This is about your daughter, Jeanie, okay?

31:14.874 --> 31:16.910
She's in a lot of danger,
and we don't have much time.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.879
I can't. I...

31:23.215 --> 31:26.628
Come on.
This isn't going to be easy to understand.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.341
l'm causing the day to repeat?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.089
Anson, you're troubled, all right?

31:34.185 --> 31:37.302
I think that you see the accidents,
you think that they're your fault,

31:37.688 --> 31:39.144
and then you try to keep everybody safe.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.315
But your affliction,
it keeps us in an endless time loop.

31:43.652 --> 31:47.019
Yeah, look, I'm aware that

31:47.114 --> 31:49.571
my condition seems irrational,
but I'm not crazy.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.654
I know the difference
between what's real and what isn't.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.406
It's just...

31:56.415 --> 32:00.875
You ever have something bad happen,
and you think about the what-ifs?

32:00.961 --> 32:03.213
-Yeah, everybody does.
-|magine that times 1,000.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.756
lfeel...

32:04.840 --> 32:09.584
| feel responsible for everything all the time.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.636
It's just torture.

32:14.141 --> 32:17.554
I think that your OCD makes you
feel responsible, but you're not.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.978
You're saying I let Jeanie die
because of my condition?

32:21.065 --> 32:23.397
No, I'm saying that
if you can control your OCD,

32:23.484 --> 32:25.770
then you can keep her
and a lot of people safe.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.237
Maybe you're the crazy one.

32:27.363 --> 32:29.604
Are you willing to bet Jeanie's life on it?

32:33.536 --> 32:35.948
Okay, Mr. Shumway, we have got to go.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.949
If I can get to your daughter,
then I can protect her.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.782
But you need to stay here,
and you need to tell me where she is.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.000
She's at the ice cream shop with her mom.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.382
How do I know you're telling the truth?

32:50.511 --> 32:52.376
Right about now,
the Red Sox are going to come back

32:52.471 --> 32:54.553
from a 10-run deficit to beat the Yankees.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.508
Then the church bells are going to ring,
a car will come, it'll be out of control.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.594
And whoever gets in its path will be killed.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.312
Boston in their incredible rally,

33:07.403 --> 33:13.114
overcoming a 10-run deﬁcit to beat New York
in what will go down as another...

33:15.536 --> 33:17.743
I'm not asking you to believe me tomorrow.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.872
I'm asking you to believe me today.

33:35.723 --> 33:38.055
Thank you. We'll call you.

33:57.828 --> 33:58.908
Officer Parker.

34:01.707 --> 34:05.199
-What's this?
-A birthday present for Jeanie from her dad.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.708
-From Dad?
-Yeah.

34:08.464 --> 34:13.049
He wanted to be here, but he's helping me
with official police business.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.960
You can talk to him, though.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.720
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

34:31.195 --> 34:32.275
Control it.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.030
Control it.

34:48.921 --> 34:50.161
-Hello?
-JEAN|E: Dad?

34:50.547 --> 34:52.003
Thanks for my present.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.998
These are just the ones I wanted.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.880
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

34:58.681 --> 35:01.172
I wish I could be there with you.

35:02.851 --> 35:07.015
You probably figured out that, um, your dad

35:09.984 --> 35:11.690
hasn't been feeling that well,

35:12.278 --> 35:14.894
and I want you to know I'm sorry.

35:14.989 --> 35:18.573
I know why you do these things, Dad.
I just wish you didn't have to.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.285
Me, too.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.362
I want you to know that

35:24.498 --> 35:27.865
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to keep you safe, sweetheart.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.744
Jeanie,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.043
you can be free.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.927
You can do whatever you want to
in this world.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.718
Never forget that, okay?

35:44.351 --> 35:45.511
I love you, Dad.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.103
I love you, too, Jean-bean.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.606
And tell Officer Parker

35:54.486 --> 35:56.477
that / believe her now.

35:57.197 --> 36:00.815
And I know what I have to do
to save everyone.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.662
Anson, you need to stay in the car.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.207
Whatever happens, don't leave this store.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.770
Oh, no!

36:30.439 --> 36:33.021
No, Anson! No!

36:41.200 --> 36:42.440
Please.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.236
Please reset.

36:44.328 --> 36:45.693
Please reset.

36:45.788 --> 36:48.029
Come on! Come on!

36:59.301 --> 37:02.213
It was an elderly man driving the car.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.296
The doc said he was just confused.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.883
Couldn't tell the brakes from the accelerator.

37:08.977 --> 37:12.310
The more scared he got,
the more confused he got.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.361
His wife's.

37:19.488 --> 37:22.651
He must have taken it
when we booted his sedan.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.825
That's probably why
that accident happened a little later.

37:27.871 --> 37:31.534
I should have been able to save Anson,
if I'd just had one more chance.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.658
No, he made his choice.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.414
You can't save everyone.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.375
But that's why I'm here.

37:45.556 --> 37:50.425
What Anson did
saved his daughter's life and this town.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.177
He did what he had to do.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.347
He got the world moving fon/vard again.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.066
No.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.112
I failed.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.024
You could never fail me.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.550
Love that Chris.

38:30.267 --> 38:31.757
What a guy.

38:34.438 --> 38:36.554
-What?
-Chris is troubled.

38:37.316 --> 38:41.150
You don't look at him,
you don't get all man crush.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.060
No way.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.403
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.907
-Now you tell me?
-Hey, no judgments. He's a handsome guy.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.451
Yeah.

38:55.584 --> 38:56.949
Yeah, shut up.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.831
-Sorry about the guy downtown.
-Yeah.

39:00.506 --> 39:03.088
Nathan said you tried to save him.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.256
Something like that.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.464
Okay, we don't have to talk about it.

39:10.599 --> 39:14.183
You know, I had this whole romantic day
planned for us.

39:18.357 --> 39:20.348
But we can do it some other time.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.273
What, you're never going to get
another day off?

39:26.615 --> 39:28.446
I don't get days off.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.157
So, what are you saying?

39:33.455 --> 39:35.320
What about London?

39:36.542 --> 39:37.952
What about that grant money?

39:40.128 --> 39:41.993
I didn't think I mentioned that.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.546
You should go.

39:50.806 --> 39:53.388
It's your work, and it's important.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.675
You can't give that up for me.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.980
Okay.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.152
See you when | get back?

40:08.490 --> 40:09.900
Definitely.

40:14.871 --> 40:15.997
Are you okay?

40:16.873 --> 40:20.001
I'm sorry. It's just been a really long day.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.432
Come inside when you're ready, okay?

40:37.394 --> 40:38.554
Yeah.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.185
-Really, guys? Really?
-Mm-hmm.

40:48.530 --> 40:49.770
The only way it's gonna work.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.405
-That's how it has to be?
-Yup.
