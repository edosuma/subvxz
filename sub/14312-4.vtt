00:08.263 --> 00:11.558
Welcome to your lair,
Master Planner.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.435
Thank you, Tinkerer.

00:13.602 --> 00:17.523
I still don't get it, doc. Why didn't you
break out with Kraven and me?

00:17.689 --> 00:22.778
Electro.
Always so charmingly uncomplicated.

00:22.945 --> 00:25.697
When building a secret empire
of super-criminals...

00:26.365 --> 00:30.202
...the safety and obscurity
of a hospital bed has its advantages.

00:30.369 --> 00:32.287
Beats prison.

00:32.454 --> 00:33.747
Indeed.

00:33.914 --> 00:36.500
Spider-Man searches
for the Master Planner...

00:36.667 --> 00:41.171
...leaving Octavius
free to, well, plan.

00:41.338 --> 00:44.967
And I assume, since you sent
my arms to retrieve me...

00:45.133 --> 00:48.095
...we are finally ready to begin?

00:48.262 --> 00:53.141
Yes. All that remains
is calibration and testing.

00:56.853 --> 00:59.022
Peter, so glad you could make it.

00:59.189 --> 01:03.443
Well, you're a hard mentor
to say no to, Mr. Osborn.

01:03.610 --> 01:06.822
What teenager doesn't like
a little epic destruction now and then?

01:06.989 --> 01:09.324
Once this old tenement
comes down...

01:09.491 --> 01:14.162
...we'll repurpose the property for
a sparkling new OsCorp R&D Tower.

01:14.830 --> 01:18.792
Peter, this is Morris Bench,
our demolitions expert.

01:18.959 --> 01:20.460
Nice setup.

01:20.627 --> 01:22.671
- Wireless?
- Completely.

01:22.838 --> 01:25.340
When we're clear,
I remote activate the countdown...

01:25.507 --> 01:30.554
...and cascading detonations bring
the building down in its own footprint.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.723
Excuse me, sir. A word.

01:32.889 --> 01:34.766
It's about Toomes.
We've had no luck--

01:34.933 --> 01:37.811
Peter, go get a good seat
for the implosion.

01:38.353 --> 01:39.688
I'll join you shortly.

01:40.772 --> 01:42.357
Sure.

01:45.193 --> 01:47.696
Your operatives scoured the city,
but the Vulture is--

01:47.863 --> 01:49.531
No. No, no, no.

01:49.698 --> 01:50.866
Countdown's activated.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.784
Thirty seconds to implosion.

01:53.201 --> 01:55.787
Shut it down.

01:55.954 --> 01:59.207
I'm trying, but I'm locked out.

01:59.374 --> 02:01.043
We'll never get clear in time.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.045
Who invited Debbie Downer?

02:07.633 --> 02:09.800
- Comfy?
- Wait, what about Peter Parker?

02:09.967 --> 02:11.720
<i>Oh, he does care.</i>

02:11.887 --> 02:13.347
Already safe. Your turn.

02:17.476 --> 02:20.145
<i>And I am out of here.</i>

03:44.813 --> 03:46.148
Ta-da.

03:46.314 --> 03:48.316
Well, we tried, Adrian.

03:48.483 --> 03:50.986
Osborn's time will come.

03:51.153 --> 03:52.696
As will Spider-Man's.

03:52.863 --> 03:55.741
Still, you must be pleased
with the initial test.

03:55.907 --> 03:57.325
Quite.

03:57.492 --> 04:01.747
Just as my neurotransmitter chip
allows me to control my arms...

04:01.913 --> 04:07.294
...I was able to activate the detonation
countdown with a thought.

04:07.753 --> 04:10.797
I didn't like the power fluctuations.
I want more in reserve.

04:10.964 --> 04:12.007
Working on it.

04:12.174 --> 04:14.217
A minor problem, Phineas.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.511
You and Adrian have done
a commendable job...

04:16.678 --> 04:20.265
...assembling the technology
Mysterio stole for us.

04:20.432 --> 04:22.350
The brainwork was all yours, Otto.

04:22.517 --> 04:25.228
Brainwork, indeed.

04:25.395 --> 04:29.191
My brain now has
a working wireless connection...

04:29.357 --> 04:32.778
...with nearly every computer
in the city.

04:32.944 --> 04:35.155
But of course
that's only the beginning.

04:35.322 --> 04:40.452
In less than 24 hours,
the entire world will be at my mercy.

04:40.619 --> 04:44.831
Just imagine the possibilities.

04:45.707 --> 04:48.043
You two doing anything tonight
for New Year's Eve?

04:48.210 --> 04:51.129
- What, like, together?
- We hadn't planned--

04:51.296 --> 04:53.882
Together, separate.
Planned, not planned.

04:54.049 --> 04:57.719
You could head to Times Square
and see the ball drop.

04:57.886 --> 05:00.055
Well, now that you mention it--

05:00.222 --> 05:02.641
And get me another muffin.
Chocolate.

05:02.808 --> 05:04.184
Sure, Flash.

05:04.351 --> 05:06.061
Coming soon to a theatre near you:

05:06.228 --> 05:09.856
<i>How I Milked My Injury,
starring</i> Flash <i>Thompson.</i>

05:10.023 --> 05:13.109
- One-seventeen.
- Oh, that's us.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.946
Nice try, Miss Subtle.

05:16.112 --> 05:21.034
But it's hopeless.
He's into Liz, not me.

05:21.201 --> 05:23.870
He's just a little confused.

05:24.037 --> 05:26.373
- Hi, Petey.
- Hey, Liz.

05:26.540 --> 05:31.127
Okay, a lot confused. Looks like Flash
and Liz are getting back together, so--

05:31.294 --> 05:35.549
- So I get to be runner-up.
- No.

05:35.715 --> 05:37.467
I wasn't supposed to say anything...

05:37.634 --> 05:40.512
...but his aunt told my aunt
you're all he thinks about.

05:40.679 --> 05:43.515
That is,
when he actually does think.

05:43.682 --> 05:45.350
This isn't my order.

05:45.517 --> 05:49.104
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Computer's glitching bigtime.

05:49.271 --> 05:52.190
The chip in this thing's
whacked too.

05:54.943 --> 05:57.612
I'm sorry, but I just need to ask
everyone to leave.

05:57.779 --> 06:00.031
Target's exiting the coffee shop.

06:00.198 --> 06:03.451
So thoughtful of you
to have GPS in your cell phone.

06:03.618 --> 06:07.455
Now all that remains
is to isolate you...

06:09.624 --> 06:11.793
...for my boys.

06:24.222 --> 06:26.141
<i>All units,
armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:26.308 --> 06:29.728
<i>See Surplus Store, corner
of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:29.895 --> 06:31.229
Dispatch, confirm.

06:31.396 --> 06:34.649
You want Midtown units
all the way up at 124th?

06:34.816 --> 06:37.402
<i>That's what my screen says.</i>

06:45.869 --> 06:50.248
And now, cue the chaos.

07:03.929 --> 07:06.014
- Is anyone hurt?
- I can't tell yet.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.976
Move, nerdette.

07:30.622 --> 07:32.248
No.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.966
Package delivered. Go.

07:43.510 --> 07:46.346
<i>Vulture's long gone.
But there's Electro's van.</i>

07:47.347 --> 07:49.474
<i>If I didn't need him
to lead me to Gwen...</i>

07:50.976 --> 07:53.395
Nothing but greens. Thanks, doc.

07:53.561 --> 07:55.730
I'm afraid you're not home free yet.

07:55.897 --> 07:58.984
The cursed arachnid is on your tail.

07:59.150 --> 08:00.610
Not a problem. We'll ditch him.

08:00.777 --> 08:02.696
Eat lightning, Spider-Man.

08:07.409 --> 08:11.079
<i>So much for quietly following them
to the Vulture's nest.</i>

08:28.513 --> 08:30.348
Where'd he go?

08:39.357 --> 08:43.068
Master Planner,
our guest has arrived.

08:43.236 --> 08:46.448
And she's kindly lent us her phone.

08:49.534 --> 08:53.079
<i>- Hey,</i> Gwen.
<i>- No, not Gwen, Captain Stacy.</i>

08:53.246 --> 08:56.416
<i>It seems you need help
keeping track of your daughter.</i>

08:56.583 --> 08:58.918
Teenagers can be such a bother.

08:59.085 --> 09:01.629
Who is this?
How did you get Gwen's phone?

09:01.796 --> 09:04.132
Oh, call me Master Planner.

09:04.299 --> 09:07.135
As for the phone,
why, from Miss Stacy, of course.

09:07.302 --> 09:09.763
<i>From Gwen? Where is she?</i>

09:10.305 --> 09:11.806
Dad?

09:14.434 --> 09:16.644
Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad, help me, I'm--

09:16.811 --> 09:18.813
_l'm__
- That's quite enough, I think.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.107
Gwen? Gwen? Put her back on.

09:21.274 --> 09:25.153
<i>Don't bother checking her GPS
on your computer. It's disabled.</i>

09:25.320 --> 09:28.656
<i>And don't call for help.
Trust me, I'll know.</i>

09:28.823 --> 09:31.451
Listen, creep, if you touch her, I'll--

09:31.618 --> 09:35.330
Let's dispense with the ugly what-ifs
and get to the business at hand.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.000
What do you want'?

09:40.335 --> 09:45.340
The global portal codes stored
at Homeland Security's New York HQ.

09:45.507 --> 09:46.549
Forget it.

09:46.716 --> 09:50.011
Those would give you access to
every government computer in the U.S.

09:50.178 --> 09:52.013
<i>- Maybe</i> the--
- The world? Yes.

09:52.514 --> 09:54.516
<i>And you will provide them.</i>

09:54.682 --> 09:57.519
Look, it's impossible.
I attend briefings at Home Sec.

09:57.685 --> 09:59.521
But I don't have clearance
for the codes.

09:59.687 --> 10:04.609
- I couldn't get them if I wanted to.
- Oh, I think you could. With a little help.

10:04.776 --> 10:06.986
And the proper motivation.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.705
Vulture's gone, Electro's gone.
But you'll tell me where to find the girl.

10:17.872 --> 10:19.791
Or else what, boy scout?

10:19.958 --> 10:22.836
We both know the hero
won't do anything rash.

10:23.461 --> 10:25.004
<i>He called my bluff.</i>

10:25.171 --> 10:26.881
<i>So I'll have to bluff better.</i>

10:33.388 --> 10:36.224
See? See?
I knew you wouldn't really let me fall.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.695
That's strike two.

10:48.862 --> 10:52.907
- Care to try for--?
- Okay, okay, I'll talk.

10:57.662 --> 10:59.998
Nice and easy, captain.

11:00.165 --> 11:03.334
Why do you need this guy? With your
brain, you can hack in anyplace.

11:03.501 --> 11:05.253
I appreciate the vote of confidence...

11:05.420 --> 11:08.339
...but the codes are kept
in an isolated system.

11:08.506 --> 11:12.218
I've no means of access
without his help.

11:12.385 --> 11:14.179
Excellent, captain.

11:14.345 --> 11:17.515
<i>Your daughter's halfway home.</i>

11:17.682 --> 11:20.101
<i>The secret entrance
to the Master Planner's lair.</i>

11:20.268 --> 11:23.396
<i>But since there's no way
I'm getting in the front door...</i>

11:27.108 --> 11:30.778
<i>I so need to invest
in a spider-themed wetsuit.</i>

11:38.411 --> 11:40.455
I'm somewhat occupied
at the moment.

11:40.622 --> 11:42.165
I'm on it.

11:42.332 --> 11:46.586
By now, captain, you'll have reached
their monitor room.

11:46.753 --> 11:48.296
Agent Wade, Agent Briggs.

11:49.464 --> 11:50.757
Monitor duty?

11:50.924 --> 11:52.634
Drew the short straw, huh?

11:52.800 --> 11:56.429
Yeah. Dullest detail in the FBI.

11:58.932 --> 12:04.103
Let's find out
just how secure the Homeland is.

12:08.483 --> 12:10.985
- I'll call it in.
- This is a federal facility, Stacy.

12:11.152 --> 12:12.987
We'll handle this. Wade, go.

12:13.154 --> 12:15.907
All security personnel,
facility under external attack.

12:16.074 --> 12:18.409
<i>External attack, indeed.</i>

12:18.576 --> 12:21.329
Squad one to the roof,
squad two, the street. Move.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.959
<i>Nice downloading, captain.</i>

12:26.125 --> 12:29.921
That virus has given me access
to all Home Sec systems...

12:30.088 --> 12:34.217
...except the proprietary mainframe
containing the portal codes.

12:34.384 --> 12:36.844
But I've increased
your security clearance.

12:37.011 --> 12:38.805
You may proceed.

12:48.106 --> 12:51.442
Look, Stacy, maybe I picked
the wrong time to get territorial.

12:59.450 --> 13:02.036
- Spider-Man.
- Don't worry, G-- Girlie.

13:02.203 --> 13:03.454
I'll have you out soon.

13:03.621 --> 13:06.332
- You're finished, web-freak.
- Look out.

13:06.499 --> 13:08.501
No! Let go of the bars.

13:10.003 --> 13:11.796
No!

13:17.844 --> 13:23.057
Electro, take this conflict elsewhere.

13:23.224 --> 13:24.559
Sure thing, M.P.

13:24.726 --> 13:28.062
<i>So the Master Planner
doesn't want all this tech damaged.</i>

13:28.646 --> 13:30.565
Max, don't tell me you're scared...

13:30.732 --> 13:32.859
...of a second-rate schemer
with a funny voice.

13:33.026 --> 13:35.903
First, I'm not scared of nothing.

13:38.239 --> 13:41.743
Second, Master Planner
ain't second-rate nothing.

13:44.746 --> 13:49.667
And third, don't call me Max,
or I'll fry you into nothing.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.589
<i>Electro, stand down.</i>

13:57.258 --> 14:01.346
<i>Retinal scan recognizes
Stacy, comma, George.</i>

14:01.512 --> 14:02.680
<i>Clearance confirmed.</i>

14:04.307 --> 14:06.184
Max. Maxie.

14:06.351 --> 14:08.728
Maximilian. Maximum.

14:08.895 --> 14:11.105
Shut up, shut up. Shut up!

14:21.115 --> 14:24.452
<i>That's for Zapping Gwen, twice.</i>

14:25.453 --> 14:27.455
<i>Nice uploading, captain.</i>

14:27.622 --> 14:31.459
<i>Now insert that drive
into any other computer.</i>

14:31.626 --> 14:34.796
<i>I'll have my codes,
you'll get your daughter.</i>

14:37.799 --> 14:39.175
I wanna talk to Gwen.

14:39.342 --> 14:43.137
This is no time to test me, captain.

14:46.474 --> 14:47.683
<i>Stow the threats.</i>

14:47.850 --> 14:50.436
<i>I'm not doing anything more
until I know she's okay.</i>

14:50.603 --> 14:52.146
Miss Stacy's resting at--

14:52.313 --> 14:54.982
<i>I talk to her, or you get nothing.</i>

14:55.149 --> 14:56.442
Fine.

15:02.990 --> 15:05.576
<i>Great. Even the walls have arms.</i>

15:05.743 --> 15:07.412
<i>But at least one mystery's solved.</i>

15:07.578 --> 15:11.416
Hey, Master Planner, some
secret-identity advice from an expert:

15:11.582 --> 15:14.752
Don't sign your work,
Doctor Octopus.

15:14.919 --> 15:19.090
<i>Yes, Spider-Man,
it's spectacularly clever of you...</i>

15:19.257 --> 15:23.594
<i>...to have guessed the truth
after I revealed it.</i>

15:26.681 --> 15:28.766
Yo, if you're gonna dance
with my date...

15:28.933 --> 15:31.018
...then I'm totally dancing
with yours.

15:42.155 --> 15:44.031
<i>Bingo.</i>

15:50.121 --> 15:52.290
<i>Okay, that was almost worth it.</i>

15:53.749 --> 15:56.461
If you want something done right...

16:07.763 --> 16:09.807
I thought the arms race was over.

16:09.974 --> 16:14.312
Oh, I've still got a few
up my sleeves.

17:03.694 --> 17:07.198
Without server to route signals...

17:07.365 --> 17:08.866
...it's too much.

17:09.032 --> 17:10.117
Too much.

17:15.205 --> 17:19.377
Must destroy connection.

17:29.053 --> 17:31.806
Congratulations, arachnid.

17:31.973 --> 17:37.728
My lair, my master plan, all ruined.

17:37.895 --> 17:40.147
Thanks. I specialise in foiling.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.817
Only one option remains.

17:52.535 --> 17:55.246
Farewell, Spider-Man.

17:57.415 --> 18:00.251
Enjoy your tomb.

18:33.117 --> 18:35.661
<i>Can't budge it.</i>

18:37.246 --> 18:39.165
<i>So cold.</i>

18:39.332 --> 18:42.168
<i>Muscles stiff, numb.</i>

18:42.335 --> 18:43.502
<i>This is it.</i>

18:44.128 --> 18:46.297
<i>Fought the good fight.</i>

18:47.048 --> 18:50.051
<i>Did my best. Even foiled Doc's plan.</i>

18:50.718 --> 18:52.553
<i>No one could ask any more of me.</i>

18:56.307 --> 18:58.517
<i>What am I doing? I can't give up.</i>

18:58.684 --> 19:00.478
<i>Not with Gwen depending on me.</i>

19:20.956 --> 19:22.500
Cold. It's cold.

19:22.667 --> 19:26.295
It'll get colder
if we don't get out of here. Hold on.

19:31.425 --> 19:33.260
What about him?

19:36.263 --> 19:39.266
So gonna hurt me more
than it hurts you.

19:43.479 --> 19:44.939
Called that right.

19:46.982 --> 19:48.109
Don't touch him.

19:48.275 --> 19:49.610
He's still juiced.

20:22.852 --> 20:24.937
<i>Abort mission.</i>

20:25.104 --> 20:27.273
Understood.

20:29.150 --> 20:32.486
Planner? Planner, are you there?

20:32.653 --> 20:34.238
- Listen, Planner--
- Dad, <i>it's</i> me.

20:34.405 --> 20:35.823
<i>- Gwen'?
- I'm okay, Daddy.</i>

20:35.990 --> 20:37.658
<i>Spider-Man saved me.</i>

20:37.825 --> 20:39.994
- Are you--?
- I'm fine, honey.

20:40.161 --> 20:42.663
Just fine. Now.

20:49.545 --> 20:51.172
One minute to midnight.

20:53.132 --> 20:55.426
I'm gonna try her again.

20:56.302 --> 20:59.472
I'm sure Gwen appreciates
your perseverance.

21:02.183 --> 21:05.478
- Hello?
- Hi, Captain Stacy.

21:05.644 --> 21:07.772
It's Pete again. Peter Parker.

21:07.938 --> 21:09.690
<i>Yeah, I know who you are, Pete.</i>

21:09.857 --> 21:12.109
But I've told you,
Gwen's been through a lot and--

21:12.276 --> 21:14.028
Dad. Is that my phone?

21:14.195 --> 21:16.614
Not tonight, it isn't.

21:16.781 --> 21:20.159
Don't you give me that look,
Gwendolyn Stacy.

21:20.493 --> 21:22.703
Now, who could that be? Peter?

21:25.039 --> 21:27.374
- Hi, Petey.
- Liz, what are you--?

21:27.541 --> 21:29.668
I mean, it's almost midnight.

21:29.835 --> 21:32.463
- Shouldn't you be with Flash?
- Ten, nine, eight...

21:32.630 --> 21:38.469
Thing is, I'll always care about Flash,
but tonight I told him it's over.

21:38.636 --> 21:40.554
Really, really over.

21:40.721 --> 21:43.432
See, I wanna be with you.

21:43.599 --> 21:45.142
"ZGTO.

21:45.309 --> 21:48.395
Happy New Year!

21:50.731 --> 21:53.234
Happy New Year, Petey.

21:55.861 --> 21:57.446
<i>Hello?</i>

21:58.113 --> 22:00.199
<i>Anyone there?</i>
