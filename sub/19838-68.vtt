00:04.090 --> 00:06.090
<b><i>Damn... Almost.</i></b>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.780
<b><i>It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.</i></b>

00:14.020 --> 00:15.250
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

00:15.660 --> 00:18.130
<b><i>He wasn't aiming for me...</i></b>

00:18.660 --> 00:20.290
<b><i>He was aiming for the woman.</i></b>

00:21.270 --> 00:22.700
<b><i>He was trying to kill her!</i></b>

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
<b>Magic x Of x Despair</b>

02:07.120 --> 02:08.290
<b><i>He's back.</i></b>

02:14.070 --> 02:16.400
<b><i>The King has returned.</i></b>

02:39.040 --> 02:41.430
<b>Hey, aren't we too close?</b>

02:41.770 --> 02:43.250
<b>It's okay...</b>

02:43.250 --> 02:46.680
<b>We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.</b>

02:47.590 --> 02:52.440
<b>The problem will be when 
the King and Pouf split up.</b>

02:53.180 --> 02:57.440
<b>Should I remove APR from Pouf, 
and use it on the King?</b>

03:00.280 --> 03:02.420
<b>These are known as human grapes.</b>

03:03.120 --> 03:06.360
<b>The humans fit to become 
soldiers wait here to hatch.</b>

03:16.750 --> 03:17.540
<b><i>Hurry!</i></b>

03:18.130 --> 03:19.060
<b><i>Hurry!</i></b>

03:20.090 --> 03:22.590
<b>Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!</b>

03:23.260 --> 03:25.930
<b>Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!</b>

03:31.760 --> 03:32.810
<b>There it is.</b>

03:33.150 --> 03:34.240
<b>Hide it fast.</b>

03:35.030 --> 03:36.360
<b>Hurry! Hurry!</b>

03:37.300 --> 03:38.980
<b>Faster! Faster!</b>

03:39.350 --> 03:40.990
<b>Faster! Faster!</b>

03:42.100 --> 03:43.430
<b>Hurry! Hurry!</b>

03:44.360 --> 03:47.180
<b>Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!</b>

03:46.620 --> 03:47.880
<b>Hurry! Hurry!</b>

03:47.880 --> 03:49.200
<b>We must also hurry!</b>

03:49.920 --> 03:51.260
<b>Where is Welfin?</b>

03:58.840 --> 04:00.110
<b>These won't work.</b>

04:00.560 --> 04:04.370
<b>When the bodies are ripped apart, 
I can't use Living Dead Dolls.</b>

04:09.950 --> 04:10.850
<b>Killua...</b>

04:13.590 --> 04:16.020
<b>The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!</b>

04:16.020 --> 04:16.790
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:17.300 --> 04:19.310
<b>We should circle around, following the wall,</b>

04:19.310 --> 04:21.250
<b>and hide in the crowd.</b>

04:21.250 --> 04:22.200
<b>Okay.</b>

04:24.570 --> 04:26.030
<b>What about Gon and Pitou?</b>

04:26.860 --> 04:30.000
<b>They just entered the Peijing hiding place.</b>

04:31.230 --> 04:33.000
<b>They're walking down a hallway.</b>

04:35.080 --> 04:37.860
<b>How does that crystal work now?</b>

04:38.310 --> 04:40.240
<b>You can also see Pouf and me in it?</b>

04:40.680 --> 04:43.560
<b>Yes, looking from a bit above.</b>

04:45.250 --> 04:47.620
<b>Wink Blue uses my crystal ball</b>

04:47.620 --> 04:50.860
<b>to remember people seen through my right eye.</b>

04:51.350 --> 04:53.120
<b>Looking through only my left eye,</b>

04:53.120 --> 04:56.700
<b>I can watch those people's current 
positions in the crystal ball.</b>

04:58.050 --> 05:00.550
<b>At the moment, the crystal ball 
is simultaneously showing</b>

05:00.550 --> 05:03.510
<b>Gon and Pitou, Killua and me,</b>

05:03.510 --> 05:06.010
<b>as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi.</b>

05:07.540 --> 05:10.430
<b>It's like watching a TV screen 
that's been split up.</b>

05:11.030 --> 05:17.030
<b>However, my right eye has only 
seen Pouf, you, and Gon.</b>

05:17.670 --> 05:21.470
<b>So I can only see the others when 
they're around one of you.</b>

05:22.950 --> 05:26.720
<b>And I can only use my power to 
watch three people at once.</b>

05:28.010 --> 05:31.940
<b>If I see someone else with my right eye,</b>

05:31.940 --> 05:36.230
<b>I won't be able to see the oldest 
of the three targets, Pouf.</b>

05:36.920 --> 05:39.960
<b>I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.</b>

05:40.350 --> 05:44.610
<b>If you can only see his main body, 
and his clones are scattered,</b>

05:44.610 --> 05:47.560
<b>it's probably more a minus than a plus.</b>

05:48.360 --> 05:49.740
<b>Is that so?</b>

05:51.280 --> 05:53.630
<b>If I can only see his main body,</b>

05:53.630 --> 05:57.370
<b>that also means I won't be fooled by clones.</b>

05:58.070 --> 06:03.630
<b>And if his main body is only the size 
of a fly, I can literally crush him.</b>

06:06.260 --> 06:09.530
<b>Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.</b>

06:10.410 --> 06:12.850
<b>What greater plus is there?</b>

06:16.450 --> 06:18.390
<b><i>So they figured me out.</i></b>

06:19.070 --> 06:22.120
<b><i>Then I just need to use that against them.</i></b>

07:06.560 --> 07:07.690
<b>Walk forward.</b>

07:27.480 --> 07:29.370
<b>It's the right door, at the end.</b>

07:52.190 --> 07:55.950
<b>Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,</b>

07:56.390 --> 08:00.950
<b>Pitou's hearing was sharp 
enough to pick up the voice</b>

08:01.250 --> 08:05.080
<b>on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.</b>

08:06.920 --> 08:09.370
<b>Pitou-sama, this is Welfin.</b>

08:10.750 --> 08:13.220
<b>I will keep this as brief as I can.</b>

08:14.100 --> 08:17.470
<b>Brovada and I have retaken the girl.</b>

08:19.720 --> 08:23.070
<b>Intruders are still around,</b>

08:23.550 --> 08:25.430
<b>so we're taking refuge beneath the palace.</b>

08:26.380 --> 08:28.410
<b>I will let you hear her voice.</b>

08:35.590 --> 08:38.400
<b>Hello? Pitou-sama?</b>

08:39.390 --> 08:41.250
<b>This is Komugi.</b>

08:41.590 --> 08:45.880
<b>I'm fine, so don't worry.</b>

08:50.420 --> 08:51.360
<b>Got it...</b>

08:52.320 --> 08:53.050
<b>Goodbye.</b>

09:10.830 --> 09:12.780
<b>Was that good?</b>

09:13.560 --> 09:14.780
<b>Yes.</b>

09:15.450 --> 09:16.690
<b>If possible,</b>

09:20.820 --> 09:24.290
<b>can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?</b>

09:25.270 --> 09:26.210
<b><i>It's him, right?</i></b>

09:27.870 --> 09:30.590
<b><i>Since I can split myself at the cellular level,</i></b>

09:31.070 --> 09:33.820
<b><i>I can also become different people.</i></b>

09:34.590 --> 09:37.590
<b><i>I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices.</i></b>

09:41.520 --> 09:44.850
<b><i>Now, Pitou is also under my spell...</i></b>

09:46.370 --> 09:50.530
<b><i>The spell of the lie that will 
free Pitou from that curse.</i></b>

09:52.080 --> 09:56.240
<b><i>So, keep watching Gon and Pitou.</i></b>

09:58.360 --> 10:01.150
<b><i>You should see something interesting soon...</i></b>

11:03.560 --> 11:07.270
<b>Now, heal Kite, like you promised.</b>

11:08.760 --> 11:12.150
<b>Once that's done, I'll release her.</b>

11:20.210 --> 11:21.280
<b>Your name...</b>

11:23.290 --> 11:26.470
<b>What is your name?</b>

11:27.500 --> 11:28.830
<b>Gon.</b>

11:28.830 --> 11:30.310
<b>Gon Freecss.</b>

11:32.750 --> 11:33.560
<b>Gon...</b>

11:34.430 --> 11:37.190
<b>You listened to my request.</b>

11:38.930 --> 11:43.430
<b>So I will be honest with you.</b>

11:47.650 --> 11:48.560
<b>He is</b>

11:50.310 --> 11:51.410
<b>already</b>

11:52.180 --> 11:53.810
<b>dead.</b>

12:19.590 --> 12:20.920
<b>Dead?</b>

12:54.290 --> 12:58.920
<b>He died during our fight.</b>

13:11.500 --> 13:12.920
<b>I remember now.</b>

13:13.960 --> 13:16.590
<b>Back then, you were...</b>

13:26.400 --> 13:30.480
<b>I was unable to revive one who was dead.</b>

13:31.590 --> 13:33.700
<b>My power could only prevent</b>

13:34.960 --> 13:37.730
<b>the body from decomposing,</b>

13:38.810 --> 13:40.710
<b>and control its movements.</b>

13:51.070 --> 13:54.820
<b>His soul is no longer here.</b>

13:55.500 --> 13:58.980
<b>There is no way to heal him.</b>

14:06.580 --> 14:07.590
<b>I am sorry.</b>

14:43.240 --> 14:44.200
<b>Palm...</b>

14:44.200 --> 14:45.040
<b>Yes?</b>

14:46.290 --> 14:47.280
<b>Thank you.</b>

14:51.540 --> 14:53.980
<b>What? What's this?</b>

14:53.980 --> 14:55.760
<b>What are you thanking me for?</b>

14:56.270 --> 14:57.740
<b>Stuff...</b>

14:57.740 --> 15:01.040
<b>Stuff? Such as?</b>

15:01.800 --> 15:05.050
<b>Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!</b>

15:05.420 --> 15:07.680
<b>What was that?</b>

15:07.680 --> 15:11.430
<b>It seems wrong to make me mad 
while you're thanking me!</b>

15:12.210 --> 15:15.640
<b>Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.</b>

15:20.050 --> 15:21.640
<b>Because now we're friends.</b>

15:23.300 --> 15:26.120
<b>I never say thanks to my friends.</b>

15:30.170 --> 15:31.790
<b>Anyway, how's Gon?</b>

15:32.720 --> 15:35.020
<b>Y-Yes, that's right...</b>

15:40.530 --> 15:41.480
<b>What's wrong?</b>

15:42.480 --> 15:43.710
<b>It can't be...</b>

15:44.640 --> 15:45.960
<b>What's going on?!</b>

15:57.930 --> 15:59.020
<b>Kite...</b>

16:04.530 --> 16:05.600
<b>Kite is...</b>

16:07.260 --> 16:08.430
<b>dead.</b>

16:23.370 --> 16:25.890
<b><i>Man, forced to take another life...</i></b>

16:26.520 --> 16:29.280
<b><i>You've grown, Gon.</i></b>

16:33.430 --> 16:34.380
<b>If I...</b>

16:37.220 --> 16:38.610
<b>If I...</b>

16:40.160 --> 16:41.640
<b><i>Whether we win or lose,</i></b>

16:42.760 --> 16:45.560
<b><i>hell lies ahead of us.</i></b>

16:49.550 --> 16:51.380
<b>If I hadn't gone with him...</b>

16:53.730 --> 16:56.870
<b>Kite wouldn't have died.</b>

17:15.040 --> 17:15.870
<b>It was...</b>

17:18.080 --> 17:19.420
<b>It was my fault.</b>

17:44.030 --> 17:48.700
<b>It was because I tagged along...</b>

17:50.520 --> 17:55.360
<b>It was really my fault...</b>

17:55.750 --> 17:57.180
<b><i>Get away from me!</i></b>

18:05.480 --> 18:08.340
<b>It's my fault that Kite is...</b>

18:10.640 --> 18:13.070
<b><i>No... It isn't my fault!</i></b>

18:13.410 --> 18:15.600
<b><i>Pitou's the one who killed him!</i></b>

18:15.600 --> 18:17.030
<b><i>Not me!</i></b>

18:20.770 --> 18:23.430
<b>But it was me...</b>

18:24.860 --> 18:26.500
<b>It was me....</b>

18:31.030 --> 18:33.660
<b>I killed Kite.</b>

18:36.920 --> 18:38.560
<b>It's my fault...</b>

18:40.090 --> 18:42.600
<b><i>No! It's Pitou's fault!</i></b>

18:44.390 --> 18:47.430
<b>But it's really my fault.</b>

18:50.100 --> 18:51.520
<b><i>Kite is alive!</i></b>

18:52.950 --> 18:56.900
<b><i>He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!</i></b>

18:59.080 --> 19:00.640
<b>Kite is dead...</b>

19:01.350 --> 19:02.900
<b>Kite is dead.</b>

19:03.650 --> 19:05.300
<b>Kite is dead.</b>

19:06.070 --> 19:07.630
<b>Kite is dead...</b>

19:08.540 --> 19:10.420
<b>Kite is dead!</b>

19:12.120 --> 19:13.250
<b>Help...</b>

19:14.780 --> 19:16.530
<b>Someone help...</b>

19:17.310 --> 19:19.940
<b>Kite is... Kite is...</b>

19:20.430 --> 19:22.930
<b>Kite is... Kite is...</b>

19:23.490 --> 19:24.750
<b><i>Kite...</i></b>

19:25.660 --> 19:27.490
<b><i>Just wait a little longer.</i></b>

19:29.090 --> 19:30.760
<b><i>I'll get you back to normal soon.</i></b>

19:38.030 --> 19:40.660
<b>I can't get him back to normal.</b>

19:41.790 --> 19:44.560
<b>Kite is gone...</b>

19:45.590 --> 19:47.030
<b>It's my fault.</b>

19:47.690 --> 19:49.020
<b>Someone help...</b>

19:50.070 --> 19:51.170
<b>Someone help Kite—</b>

19:51.170 --> 19:54.210
<b><i>No! No! No! No! No!</i></b>

19:55.230 --> 19:57.210
<b><i>But... But...</i></b>

19:57.210 --> 19:58.210
<b><i>But...</i></b>

19:58.210 --> 20:00.720
<b><i>But... But... But... But...</i></b>

20:01.080 --> 20:01.720
<b><i>But...</i></b>

20:11.000 --> 20:12.620
<b><i>Doctor Blythe.</i></b>

20:21.120 --> 20:22.250
<b><i>What?</i></b>

20:23.180 --> 20:25.260
<b><i>Pitou's going to help Kite?</i></b>

20:28.940 --> 20:31.640
<b><i>Oh, it's true...</i></b>

20:32.320 --> 20:34.780
<b><i>Kite being dead was a lie.</i></b>

20:35.770 --> 20:37.680
<b><i>Pitou will heal him.</i></b>

20:41.340 --> 20:42.260
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

20:43.500 --> 20:46.470
<b><i>Why is it healing Pitou's arm?</i></b>

20:47.740 --> 20:50.270
<b><i>Turn Kite back to normal.</i></b>

20:54.560 --> 20:56.140
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

20:57.270 --> 21:00.230
<b><i>After you finish what you're doing.</i></b>

21:02.480 --> 21:04.700
<b>Why? What's going on?!</b>

21:05.020 --> 21:07.960
<b>What's wrong? What happened, Palm?</b>

21:07.960 --> 21:09.530
<b>I don't know...</b>

21:09.530 --> 21:12.310
<b>I can only see what's happening...</b>

21:12.310 --> 21:13.960
<b>But something is wrong with Gon!</b>

21:13.960 --> 21:15.670
<b>What's wrong?!</b>

21:16.420 --> 21:20.960
<b>Pitou is healing itself, not Kite.</b>

21:22.130 --> 21:25.300
<b>Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.</b>

21:25.760 --> 21:26.580
<b>Impossible...</b>

21:27.970 --> 21:31.480
<b>As long as she's in our hands, Pitou...</b>

21:32.800 --> 21:34.960
<b>Pitou has to obey us!</b>

21:55.100 --> 21:56.320
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

21:57.540 --> 21:58.950
<b><i>Help Kite.</i></b>

23:24.420 --> 23:26.670
<b>Next time: Anger x And x Light.</b>

23:26.670 --> 23:28.220
<b>Hold on until I get there!</b>

23:28.490 --> 23:31.510
<b>I don't care if this is the end...</b>

23:31.900 --> 23:34.760
<b>I'll kill you, Pitou!</b>

23:34.760 --> 23:35.610
<b>Gon!</b>
