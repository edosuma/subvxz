WEBVTT

00:50.800 --> 00:53.136
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.219 --> 00:55.680
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:01.227 --> 01:04.022
This is the Dream Base project by the SRF

01:04.105 --> 01:06.900
for which a nation-wide donation effort
has been carried out.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
But we've received reports
that the project fund

01:09.778 --> 01:13.323
<i>has been trickling
into some private pockets.</i>

01:13.406 --> 01:16.576
They are the private pockets
of the key persons of this project.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.966
I will reward you handsomely
out of my own pocket

01:32.050 --> 01:35.804
if you come forward with information
about where your donations are going

01:36.387 --> 01:38.932
and what the real purpose
behind this project is.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.725
I promise.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.893
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.321
Kang Yo-han that bastard…

01:54.155 --> 01:57.283
Did he just
put a bounty on the head of the country?

01:58.535 --> 02:01.538
My face was on my own channel
for something such as this…

02:01.621 --> 02:03.540
Look, that's not what's important here.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.334
He practically declared war
against the country.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.129
This is a rebellion!

02:09.212 --> 02:10.588
How dare he slander me?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.174
He's accusing of bilking
pennies from our people?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.009
That's just ridiculous!

02:15.093 --> 02:19.264
After all that money I spent on
trying to salvage the poor…

02:19.764 --> 02:22.142
This is what I get in return
for my good deeds?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.018
Is he a national traitor or what?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.937
And just what is Chairman Seo doing?

02:26.020 --> 02:30.608
What's he thinking after
just sending his secretary here?

02:31.776 --> 02:33.903
With all due respect,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.364
I think you are
all getting overly worked up.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.616
They're just ungrounded suspicions.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.494
Aren't they?

02:44.706 --> 02:47.167
Of course they're groundless.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.378
You have a strange way of talking,
Director Jung. Watch your tongue.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.756
How dare he get so cheeky like that?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.551
Of course! That isn't just any money.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.317
You were the one who kidnapped
Jang Ki-hyun, weren't you?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.028
-I needed to have a chat with him.
-You mean a chat like

03:15.111 --> 03:17.614
"Let's get our story straight
to con the entire country.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.699
Otherwise you'll be in danger too."

03:19.782 --> 03:21.326
Can't you put it in a better way?

03:21.409 --> 03:24.203
There was truth in the message
although there were some sugarcoating.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.332
Sugarcoating?

03:27.832 --> 03:31.377
Are you sure you only helped him out
because you pitied him?

03:31.461 --> 03:35.089
You don't mean you offered to pay him
if he testified as instructed?

03:35.965 --> 03:39.469
It could be that I pitied him
awfully from the very start.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.387
Why are you being so judgmental?

03:43.556 --> 03:46.643
Anyway, so it wasn't you
who attacked Su-hyeon.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.895
So now you believe me, do you?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.688
That I'm not someone to do that.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.943
You are more than capable of it,

03:55.026 --> 03:57.320
but you just didn't see the need
to do so, I guess.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.238
Need?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.490
You must have kidnapped him
after realizing that

04:00.573 --> 04:02.742
Cha Gyeong-hui found
his transaction history.

04:02.825 --> 04:06.412
And that's why you didn't see
a need to deal with Su-hyeon,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.831
who appeared out of the blue
to snatch his bankbook.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.710
Now why did a smart fellow like you

04:12.794 --> 04:15.338
lose all his reason that day?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.675
I'm not sure if I should be hearing that

04:18.758 --> 04:22.178
from someone who almost killed me
just for taking Elijah out for a while.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.477
Then who was it that attacked Su-hyeon?

04:30.895 --> 04:34.691
Someone who doesn't look at me
so favorably, I guess.

04:43.157 --> 04:46.953
Just what is Judge Kang planning?

04:50.206 --> 04:52.875
I thought the foundation does good things.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.461
They help out those in need
and do charity work.

04:58.214 --> 05:02.135
Judge Oh. There's something
I've been keeping from you.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.136
Yes?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.931
Why did you leave me out?

05:07.974 --> 05:10.143
A secret party attended
only by the key persons of the foundation?

05:10.226 --> 05:13.563
And you're telling me
just the two of you went?

05:13.646 --> 05:17.275
I still have that super expensive dress
Judge Kang gave me the other day.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.526
I'm really sorry.

05:18.609 --> 05:22.155
But that's not the only reason
why you're mad, right?

05:22.238 --> 05:26.034
Of course! Intervening with the trial
and all are completely not right.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.329
Should we just take it to the press?
There's a reporter I'm close with.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.747
-Reporter?
-Yes.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.207
She works for a fashion magazine
called <i>Bling Bling</i>.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.043
I see…

05:36.544 --> 05:38.046
Actually, no.

05:40.089 --> 05:43.217
Let's cool our heads
and review this once more.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.554
So you mean they all gathered together
including the president

05:46.637 --> 05:48.723
and intervened with
Lee Young-min's trial, right?

05:48.806 --> 05:52.060
-And dealing with rights and interests?
-Yes.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.022
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.774
-What about Judge Kang?
-Pardon?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.817
What did he say to them?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.320
Is he on their side too?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.198
Why won't you tell me about that?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.368
Well…

06:09.452 --> 06:11.537
He'd kept quiet then,

06:11.621 --> 06:14.207
but from how he declared war
in their faces…

06:14.290 --> 06:16.250
I just don't know anymore

06:16.334 --> 06:18.711
if he's actually cool
or just trying to be cool.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.506
Still, it's true
he tampered with the witness.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.842
Is a judge allowed to do that?
And that press conference was a show too.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.303
Then he goes and plays
the vote of confidence card.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.057
I can't help
but think that he's deceiving us.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.605
You know, I was his big fan.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.690
He was so confident, righteous,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.360
and just shined.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.990
But now… I don't know anymore.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.164
<i>Try being more greedy.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:57.667
<i>You were the one who shined the most</i>

06:57.750 --> 07:00.128
<i>on the </i>Live Court Show<i>.</i>

07:00.211 --> 07:02.380
Twinkle, twinkle.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.856
<i>If you wish to reach for the stars,</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:26.279
<i>if you truly desire them,</i>

07:28.614 --> 07:32.368
<i>start by changing yourself.</i>

07:35.913 --> 07:38.416
<i>Be the giant</i>

07:41.169 --> 07:44.881
<i>so the stars are within your reach.</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:21.417
Perfect.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.211
Seon-a.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.171
Yes?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.424
Gosh, your skin's just glowing today.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.594
A compliment from you is a rare thing.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.638
Is something on your conscience?

08:34.555 --> 08:36.182
Just jealous. That's all.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.727
Anyway, what should I do with this?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.812
The bankbook I took from Yoon Su-hyeon.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.940
Oh, the seed?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.150
Throw it away.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.153
You're one evil princess.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.489
Geez, all this for nothing?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.032
What do you mean nothing?

08:53.115 --> 08:56.160
It's all necessary to build a story.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.915
Enough about that.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.002
The real game starts now.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.588
Keep a good eye
on those old geezers at the foundation.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.298
Not Kang Yo-han?

09:10.299 --> 09:13.511
Our wolf has made an entrance
much wilder than I'd expected

09:13.594 --> 09:16.806
to our sheep farm.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.018
So now my scared sheep
are about to get wild.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.061
All right.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.854
One more thing.

09:23.938 --> 09:27.441
I think you'll need to do
the self-healing lecture for our website.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.361
Me?

09:30.444 --> 09:33.447
Kang Yo-han just put up a picture of
Seo Jeong-hak for all to see

09:33.531 --> 09:36.993
and ranted about how he bilked
public donations, didn't he?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.161
If word gets out
that he's giving a lecture,

09:39.245 --> 09:40.663
the journalists will hound him.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.959
Oh, but I detest cheesy titillations.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.921
Jae-hee.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.756
Yes?

09:52.633 --> 09:54.510
Had you been quicker,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.887
you could have gotten to
Jang Ki-hyeon first.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.265
Or am I wrong?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.184
Oh… sorry.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.063
I didn't think that judge
would go that far.

10:22.997 --> 10:23.914
Get it right.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.418
You can do that, right?

10:30.504 --> 10:31.464
Yes.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.883
I promise you. No mistakes this time.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.930
We have just one more step left.

10:40.890 --> 10:41.974
You know that, right?

10:51.525 --> 10:54.445
If I catch you dozing off
during Chairman Seo's lecture,

10:54.528 --> 10:55.988
you better be prepared!

10:56.072 --> 10:57.281
Yes, ma'am.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.742
I'm sick and tired of you
giving me that look.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.327
Hello, ma'am.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.038
Are you from the foundation?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.290
Chairman Seo is running late
today, isn't he?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.836
Hello, I'm here on his behalf today.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.797
This is Director Jung Seon-a.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.882
Oh, are you?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.425
Welcome, Director.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.473
You're a pretty little thing.
How old are you?

11:23.974 --> 11:25.726
Eighteen.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.396
She's adorable, isn't she?

11:29.063 --> 11:30.356
Go up now.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.482
Come on.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.442
Goodbye.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.572
They're all orphans or runaways,

11:38.656 --> 11:40.658
so they're not very good kids.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.036
I advise you to watch your valuables
when going near them.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.874
Not very good, did you say?

11:50.459 --> 11:51.669
Pardon?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.383
It must be so much work for you, ma'am.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.636
Please. Then shall we?

12:03.597 --> 12:06.016
LECTURE ON SELF-HEALING FROM THE SRF

12:18.654 --> 12:21.031
<i>What is she saying?</i>

12:29.915 --> 12:31.125
This is my name.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.294
"Seon" for good, and "a" for child.

12:33.377 --> 12:36.505
I'm all grown up now, yet they are still
telling me to be a good girl.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.343
I guess that's what my mom wished for me.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.180
She wanted me to grow up nice
like everybody else.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.685
So why did she?

12:50.352 --> 12:53.022
I wonder why she beat me so

12:53.105 --> 12:55.691
whenever she was drunk?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.949
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.120
Seeing you reminded me
of my past for some reason.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.540
-Honestly, I should be more composed.
-My mother was like that too.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.083
Really?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.421
She's normally an angel,

13:17.505 --> 13:19.882
but whenever she drank, she…

13:20.758 --> 13:21.967
First she'd cry, and then…

13:24.970 --> 13:28.349
I'm sure it was because
life was hard for her.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.561
I didn't understand back then,
but I think I do now.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.524
Her husband abandoned her and their child,

13:36.607 --> 13:39.568
and she's exhausted
getting through each day…

13:41.195 --> 13:43.531
Still, she shouldn't have.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.618
She shouldn't have done it
just because life was tough.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.288
I thought my mom hated me

13:51.372 --> 13:53.749
because I was a bad girl.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.254
I'd curse, get into fights, and steal…

13:58.337 --> 14:00.673
But back then, I just had no choice.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.217
I was surrounded by those who cursed me,

14:03.300 --> 14:06.136
made fun of me, and beat me.

14:08.722 --> 14:12.101
And I was really hungry.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.146
But you know what?

14:17.189 --> 14:21.777
One day when I was 12,
I went to work for a rich family.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.950
And wow, the young masters there
were so beautiful and nice.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.829
They smelled good and didn't even curse!

14:31.912 --> 14:33.789
They just twinkled.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.877
If I had been good like them,

14:38.669 --> 14:40.671
would my mother have not beaten me?

14:41.755 --> 14:43.257
Would she have loved me?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.808
So everyone.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.356
What do you need to do to be a good girl?

15:03.569 --> 15:05.112
You need to be rich.

15:05.195 --> 15:09.033
You can only be nice on a full stomach.
The world out there is a jungle.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.703
You can only barely survive
by slaughtering and preying on each other,

15:12.786 --> 15:14.705
so how can you find time
to be nice, right?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.083
So survive, no matter what.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.378
If they hit you, bite them back.
If you don't have what they have,

15:21.462 --> 15:22.338
snatch it off them.

15:23.631 --> 15:28.719
Because it's especially harder
for you girls who are alone.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.473
There's always a beast or two
wherever you go.

15:32.556 --> 15:36.769
Whether they're educated or respected,
they're all the same.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.985
So what should you do
if scumbags like them lunge at you?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.696
Report them to the police.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.241
No! You grab their weakness.

15:54.411 --> 15:58.457
The law is never on our side.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.877
You need to secure evidence,
no matter what. Record it, or film it.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.925
Then…

16:09.051 --> 16:11.762
you torture them to death.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.766
You tell them
you'll ruin everything that they have

16:15.849 --> 16:19.103
until they become well-tamed dogs.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.070
-Understood?
-Yes!

16:33.033 --> 16:34.702
Yes, go on.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.205
Well, you're now a success, aren't you?

16:38.872 --> 16:43.085
Does your mother now love you then?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.632
My mother died when I was 12.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.011
She fell from the stairs
in her drunken stupor.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.513
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.473
It's okay.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.267
It's all in the past anyway.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.273
Your lecture was something new
yet so realistic.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.484
I was extremely touched, Director.

17:08.902 --> 17:12.031
I don't have much experience
with something like this…

17:12.114 --> 17:13.782
I was a bit clumsy today, wasn't I?

17:13.866 --> 17:17.369
What do you mean? You were stellar!

17:17.453 --> 17:22.416
That's why we'd love to have you
again for another inspiring speech.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.500
Sure.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.505
Then please invite me again next time.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.840
Of course.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.380
How did you know where I was?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.800
Did you plant
a tracking device on me or something?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.388
Why bother to ask
when you've already found it?

18:22.726 --> 18:26.355
It's up to me where I go and who I meet!

18:26.438 --> 18:28.357
Who are you to decide these things for me?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.150
Whether you like it or not,
I'm your guardian.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.737
Guardian? You mean keeper.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.532
You should have learned
your lesson by now.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.243
No one approaches another
without a reason.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.537
Aren't you tired too?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.956
You pretended to be so smart
ever since you were little,

18:44.039 --> 18:46.959
but when someone reaches out a hand,
you just follow them like a puppy

18:47.042 --> 18:48.794
-and be used like an idiot.
-That's enough.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.639
Is it her fault she was lonely?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.683
Stop talking like that.

19:04.351 --> 19:07.229
You dare teach me how to speak, do you?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.940
-I'm her guardian!
-Exactly.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.109
Elijah has no one else but you.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.866
So why not try being more honest for once?

19:25.247 --> 19:26.582
Don't make me laugh.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.130
You think you've been here
long enough to know everything, do you?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.633
Sorry if I was stepping out of line.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.472
Let's go.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.247
-Butler.
<i>-Yes, Master.</i>

20:14.963 --> 20:18.759
How do you talk to teenagers?

20:18.842 --> 20:20.469
<i>Well, experts say</i>

20:20.552 --> 20:23.764
<i>the start of every conversation is
to listen and to relate,</i>

20:23.847 --> 20:27.017
<i>and that it is important to boost
their self-esteem with positive--</i>

20:27.100 --> 20:28.143
Forget it.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.107
Just order me some books on the topic.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.150
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

20:56.296 --> 21:00.509
You asked me why I was the son of
restaurant owners for 16 years.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.843
Do you remember?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.640
That's when they passed away.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.767
My mom and dad.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.061
When I was 16.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
Oh… really?

21:16.775 --> 21:19.278
Why? Did they get into an accident?

21:21.571 --> 21:25.200
They were deceived by a malicious
fraud and lost everything.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.578
My father abandoned this world
on his own will,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.581
and my mother collapsed from the shock.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.672
Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.633
Gosh, what am I supposed to say
at a time like this?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.261
It's okay. It was a long time ago.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.016
But that's not something
you can forget so easily.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.060
That's true, I guess.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.902
It's been difficult for you, right?
Same with me.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.405
I hated coming home to an empty house,

22:03.488 --> 22:06.283
so I'd just sleep anywhere
and hang out with anyone.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.119
It was lonely
and I felt like an abandoned dog.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.294
You're a strong kid, Elijah.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.507
-I am?
-Of course.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.010
You bore it all alone in this big mansion.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.222
You're truly something.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.936
Stop it. You're making me cringe.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.730
I thought you're the callous type.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.815
Was that too obvious?

22:39.775 --> 22:42.819
I guess it's not easy saying
something you don't mean.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.989
You want a piece of me?

22:48.575 --> 22:52.579
What feisty hands like someone I know.
Well, good night.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.325
<i>HOW TO TALK TO YOUR TEENAGE CHILDREN</i>

23:32.619 --> 23:33.995
All right, let's smile.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.164
Let's smile and talk.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.342
Oh what? It was you, Yo-han?

23:48.176 --> 23:49.845
What's with that look on your face?

23:51.096 --> 23:52.347
What do you want?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.143
I need to smile.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.020
-Well…
-If you don't have business…

24:05.694 --> 24:08.196
-How was your day today?
-What?

24:10.407 --> 24:15.912
Well, did you have a good day or not?

24:15.996 --> 24:19.583
Maybe there's something we can talk about…

24:28.800 --> 24:32.220
Well, actually…

24:32.304 --> 24:33.471
Yes, what is it?

24:33.555 --> 24:36.349
That bastard who conned Ga-on's parents.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.768
Who was that bastard, exactly?

24:39.519 --> 24:41.563
So it's about Ga-on again?

24:41.646 --> 24:44.524
Sure, let's keep smiling.

24:47.611 --> 24:51.364
It's a bastard who bilked millions
from the poor through a pyramid scheme.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.950
At least ten of his victims
ended up taking their lives.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.660
-Really?
-Yes.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.663
I see.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.956
So…

25:01.791 --> 25:04.836
Darn it…

25:05.503 --> 25:07.005
Butler, are you kidding me?

25:07.881 --> 25:09.633
Do as the book says and what?

25:09.716 --> 25:13.261
<i>Master, stress is harmful to your health.</i>

25:13.345 --> 25:15.347
-On the kitchen counter is--
-What are you…

25:15.430 --> 25:17.933
<i>Make sure to take one a day.</i>

25:18.016 --> 25:20.769
<i>You need to start looking after
yourself at your age.</i>

25:20.852 --> 25:22.103
Whatever, get lost.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.462
BLUE HOUSE

25:47.545 --> 25:49.422
Let me begin.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.968
In regards to the sudden remarks
by Judge Kang Yo-han

25:53.051 --> 25:56.972
during the recent <i>Live Court Show</i>,
the Blue House is cautiously--

25:57.055 --> 25:58.390
It's fake news!

26:02.269 --> 26:03.895
Fellow Koreans. I, Heo Joong-se, am

26:03.979 --> 26:06.606
where I am today after overcoming
all kinds of slander and defamation.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.819
Now, even one of our judges
is spreading fake news about me.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.362
Is this really
the Republic of Korea I know?

26:12.445 --> 26:16.157
And Judge Kang Yo-han spread
these rumors in these tumultuous times.

26:16.241 --> 26:20.662
Is he truly one of the fellow citizens
whom I care and respect for?

26:22.372 --> 26:23.832
Truth be told,

26:23.915 --> 26:27.502
we saw a flood of reports
about Judge Kang Yo-han.

26:27.585 --> 26:31.256
For example, he's scheming with foreign
powers to cause social agitation

26:31.339 --> 26:33.258
or that he isn't pure Korean!

26:33.341 --> 26:35.510
In other words,
his heritage is different from ours!

26:35.593 --> 26:40.849
Moreover, we even received a tip-off that
he is a paid puppet for another country!

26:41.599 --> 26:44.561
To anyone who comes forward
with information on Judge Kang

26:44.644 --> 26:47.022
for the sake of our national security,

26:47.105 --> 26:51.234
there will be a handsome reward
commensurate to its content.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.738
I promise a hell of a reward!

26:54.821 --> 26:57.115
Will that be out of your own pockets then?

26:57.198 --> 26:58.199
That's all from me.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.869
-One comment, please?
-How will it be paid with what?

27:00.952 --> 27:04.539
We will be back tomorrow with a summary.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.003
Don't you think you've gone too far?

27:10.086 --> 27:11.796
Politics is not a comedy.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.841
-You just got many talking now.
-It's better to make it a comedy.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.886
-What?
-Comedy, competition…

27:17.969 --> 27:19.429
Let them get used to it

27:19.512 --> 27:22.307
and they'll shy away
from the complicated stuff.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.852
Why do you think I mentioned
the word "commensurate?"

27:25.935 --> 27:28.396
It's all to rouse competition!

27:29.064 --> 27:32.817
I'm turning this
all into a full-fledged variety show.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.071
Gosh, you…

27:36.154 --> 27:39.491
Throw them something
so they're preoccupied.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.743
<i>Will this be okay?</i>

27:43.078 --> 27:44.162
<i>What about?</i>

27:44.245 --> 27:46.998
<i>He was a famous actor ten years ago,</i>

27:47.082 --> 27:49.542
-but now he's our president.
-Yes, you're right.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.629
The President, the Minister of Justice,
media moguls…

27:52.712 --> 27:54.631
They practically are
the Republic of Korea.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.926
Exactly. You just waged war
against the country.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.719
Will you be okay?

27:59.803 --> 28:02.013
Do you know how they gained power?

28:03.807 --> 28:05.767
Through hypocrisy.

28:08.061 --> 28:11.689
And the direr the crisis,
the easier to touch people's hearts.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.024
The Foundation aggressively expanded

28:13.108 --> 28:15.652
the size of its charity projects
ever since the pandemic.

28:16.611 --> 28:20.490
However, it wasn't disaster relief
that was the bulk of their expense.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.325
Then what?

28:23.576 --> 28:24.744
Promotion and marketing.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.665
They promoted and exaggerated themselves
on all kinds of media channels.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.170
They were selling
the image of the fully responsible elite.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.548
Now that they seized power
using that as a weapon,

28:36.631 --> 28:39.092
what do you think they're capable of next?

28:39.175 --> 28:40.301
Recoup the cost.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.011
No, much more than that.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.765
They are scheming the Dream Base project,

28:45.849 --> 28:49.060
and it is actually to build
a concentration camps

28:49.144 --> 28:51.938
with public donations
to wipe out all the homeless, the poor,

28:52.021 --> 28:55.191
and those who voice dissent. And then…

28:57.527 --> 29:00.530
Next, they will carry out a nation-wide
urban regeneration project.

29:00.613 --> 29:04.367
They would've already bought all the lands
under borrowed names for almost nothing.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.163
Did you secure decisive evidence then?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.165
You think it's that easy?

29:10.248 --> 29:13.626
These guys blew up a judge's chamber
without batting an eye.

29:13.710 --> 29:17.172
But still, you waged war against them
in front of the entire nation?

29:17.255 --> 29:18.673
But it's fun.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.008
Pardon?

29:20.091 --> 29:22.302
It should be fun at least.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.928
I'm getting cornered anyway.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.309
So are you having fun?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.688
Don't you think
you're being irresponsible?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.732
What about Elijah?

29:37.442 --> 29:39.235
Do you ever think about her?

29:43.114 --> 29:44.073
I do.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.243
Always.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.711
Give me all the material
you've gathered on the foundation.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.213
So you'll assist me?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.300
-Just promise me one thing.
-What?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.512
No subornation of perjury,
kidnapping, blackmailing,

30:05.595 --> 30:08.640
nor lying to the innocent
and making a fool out of them…

30:08.723 --> 30:11.684
I can't afford to be
a shameless lawbreaker.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.397
Not in front of my parents
who died because of fraud,

30:17.440 --> 30:18.817
and not in front of Su-hyeon.

30:21.861 --> 30:22.946
You know what?

30:25.907 --> 30:29.118
A Judge is most powerful
when he goes by the law, Judge Kang.

30:31.037 --> 30:33.957
So you can't be a shameless lawbreaker

30:35.542 --> 30:39.254
and claim that a judge is most powerful
when he goes by the law.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.008
Whatever, up to you.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.181
You have everyone's attention now
by raising suspicions,

30:50.265 --> 30:51.474
so what next?

30:54.727 --> 30:55.728
Discord.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.523
MINBO

31:03.152 --> 31:06.865
There's no way around it if those who
dominate the world have formed one team.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.991
I need to shake them up first.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.372
Perhaps we could start with that.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.845
MINBO

31:28.928 --> 31:31.014
MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXCESSIVE WORK HOURS!

31:45.236 --> 31:47.155
MIN YONG-SIK MUST STEP DOWN!

31:50.658 --> 31:52.535
Yes, I understand.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.373
What floor is the CEO's office?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.168
Judge Kang?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.337
It's on the 20th floor.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.804
This is the lobby.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.348
Judge Kang Yo-han has just…

32:19.479 --> 32:22.732
Judge Kang, our CEO is
in a meeting right now.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.942
I'll wait.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.111
Oh, will you? This way then.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.286
Don't mind me.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.496
Sure.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.357
Seven minutes and 30 seconds.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.324
You're just going to leave, Judge Kang?

33:13.408 --> 33:14.575
My business is done.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.177
Goodbye.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.526
You asked me to inform you
if something ever happened.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.077
MIN YONG-SIK MUST STEP DOWN!

34:07.545 --> 34:13.968
Five, four, three, two, one.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.180
And 0.5, 0.25, 0.125…

34:19.098 --> 34:21.267
PARK DU-MAN, PRESIDENT OF HMBN

34:21.350 --> 34:22.560
Hello, President Park.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.149
Come on. Just tell me, Judge Kang.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.780
Is there something I don't know?

34:36.115 --> 34:38.367
You know I'm always
on your side, don't you?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.705
Remember the whole deal
about tampering with witnesses?

34:43.372 --> 34:44.874
That's Cha Gyeong-hui's work.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.719
Anyway, do you think you can handle this?

34:56.803 --> 34:59.263
You just made everyone in
the foundation your enemies.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.727
Don't you have any questions for me?
I can tell you all that I know.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.570
So you're sucking on your fingers.

35:17.698 --> 35:20.618
You guys must be hungry.
Sorry I wasn't being so considerate.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.078
Go grab yourself something.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.163
Now scram!

35:24.831 --> 35:25.957
Go treat yourself!

35:29.001 --> 35:31.337
I mean, we're only doing this
to survive, aren't we?

35:31.420 --> 35:32.588
You guys go ahead first.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.554
It's me.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.764
Do you know who our old man
is with right now?

35:44.725 --> 35:46.769
Whatever you discussed with Park Du-man

35:46.853 --> 35:50.273
and whatever came out from
that bastard's mouth are all lies.

35:50.356 --> 35:53.234
Whatever he gave you, it's all fake.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.153
Everything he says is a lie.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.946
In fact, he only speaks lies.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.447
Ever since we were young…

35:58.531 --> 36:01.617
He spends his entire day thinking
about how he'll get ahead of me.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.369
Back in middle school,

36:03.452 --> 36:06.581
he'd tell everyone that he was in college!

36:06.664 --> 36:08.666
Just think about it.

36:08.749 --> 36:12.420
What reason would I have
to touch the foundation's money?

36:12.503 --> 36:15.965
If there's anyone who could do
such a thing, it's Min Yong-sik.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.926
<i>Besides, do you know
how he won over his wife?</i>

36:19.010 --> 36:20.511
Ms. Pi, I mean.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.931
When she was drunk at a nightclub…

36:24.015 --> 36:27.852
Minbo Group is tight on funds these days.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.072
I'll sneak
the foundation's accounts for you.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.742
I already have it all prepared for you.

36:42.825 --> 36:47.455
Don't you worry.
I'll deliver it as is to you, Judge Kang.

36:47.538 --> 36:51.709
Whatever that Min Yong-sik
gave you, it's all fake!

36:51.792 --> 36:53.252
Do not fall for it.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.466
-Is that right?
-Yes.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.970
Go on and eat. Let's talk as we eat.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.014
Try some of this. It's their specialty.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.727
SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT
FOR BUILDING CONSTRUCTION

38:11.372 --> 38:13.249
Will you come with us, Judge Kang?

38:13.916 --> 38:15.501
The VIP wishes to see you.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.621
This is quite unexpected, Mr. President.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.334
What is?

38:56.417 --> 38:59.003
I didn't expect you
to summon me like this.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.505
It was quite frightening.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.799
I thought they were going to
bury me somewhere.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.843
What are you talking about, Judge Kang?

39:05.926 --> 39:09.722
You humiliated me
by bringing my photo up on the screen

39:09.805 --> 39:11.265
for the entire nation to see.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.476
I'd be too battered to do anything to you.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.813
But you know,

39:18.522 --> 39:20.358
this could be more the reason

39:21.609 --> 39:24.779
for people to be surprised.

39:24.862 --> 39:29.450
Just think. "A president did this with
his own hands amidst all this commotion?"

39:29.533 --> 39:31.452
It should be fun, right?

39:31.535 --> 39:34.413
While they doubt it, time will pass

39:35.081 --> 39:38.250
and with one or two
big celebrity scandals,

39:38.334 --> 39:40.503
people should forget all about it
soon enough.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.171
Like goldfish.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.216
That's quite a plausible scenario.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.434
You're anxious, aren't you? Judge Kang.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.104
You're the mighty Judge Kang after all.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.441
You look dashing in that suit, by the way.
But you must have been busy lately,

40:02.525 --> 40:04.610
meeting bastards here and there.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.654
Yes, just like now.

40:11.742 --> 40:17.665
And I wonder what those bastards gave you.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.005
Don't you think
the scenario I just mentioned sounds fun?

40:25.089 --> 40:29.135
You know,
I could just execute it right now.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.348
If you say so.

40:43.149 --> 40:46.235
Hello, subscribers of
Heo Joong-se's channel.

40:47.361 --> 40:50.489
Welcome! Today the President
has invited me too.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.241
Thank you, Mr. President.

40:52.324 --> 40:55.202
Wow! We're already joined by so many.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.580
Look at the comments flooding in!

40:58.247 --> 41:00.374
Yes, that's me. Judge Kang Yo-han.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.793
Thank you, Mr. President.

41:02.877 --> 41:07.173
So you changed your mind and decided to
look into the foundation issues, right?

41:07.673 --> 41:10.259
-Oh, yes.
-He even invited me here at the Blue House

41:10.342 --> 41:12.720
for a joint cooperative effort, everyone.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.640
-Thank you so much, Mr. President.
-No problem, Judge Kang.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.852
The President and I, together,
will get down to the bottom of

41:19.935 --> 41:22.730
where your donations have ended up.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.317
That's it for today.
How about we all shout it out together?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.402
-The man to change Korea totally,
-Change!

41:28.486 --> 41:30.488
Heo Joong-se!
Yes, the man to solve all your woes!

41:30.571 --> 41:33.365
If you're a patriot,
please subscribe, press like,

41:33.449 --> 41:36.243
leave comments, and set up alerts too!

41:37.036 --> 41:38.120
Now wave.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.788
With a smile.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.709
Give me a brighter one.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.642
Are you already done with the analysis?
Impressive.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.978
Though they diverted it here and there,
there were some gaps.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.104
Gaps?

42:04.188 --> 42:06.023
They spent too much effort with the PR.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.734
They consistently published
their achievements

42:08.817 --> 42:12.446
about how the foundation has donated
millions and billions for the project.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.031
But the amount is just too big.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.950
If you look at the size of the project,

42:16.033 --> 42:19.203
the donations from the public alone
is already sufficient to fund it.

42:19.286 --> 42:21.038
So they pretended
they had donated everything

42:21.121 --> 42:23.415
when it was purely driven
by public donations?

42:24.500 --> 42:25.543
They're just my suspicions.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.587
We'll only know for sure
with the foundation's internal accounts.

42:28.671 --> 42:32.091
The materials from Park Du-man
and Min Yong-sik were fake too, right?

42:33.133 --> 42:36.011
Yes, they'd dressed it
to make each other the scapegoat.

42:37.054 --> 42:40.182
I didn't expect those old weasels
to hand anything over so willingly.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.935
-Any reports?
-Nothing useful so far.

42:43.018 --> 42:46.689
They're mostly pranks
or false information to get the reward.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.274
We'll still need to make payouts.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.526
-What?
-The reward.

42:50.609 --> 42:52.695
But just for such information?

42:52.778 --> 42:54.613
What's important isn't the context,
but the numbers.

42:55.489 --> 42:58.117
We'll post the number of reports received
on the Internet.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.453
As if something big is happening.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.249
Do you know what's crucial
in deceiving others?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.251
Attitude.

43:07.334 --> 43:09.336
That unwavering attitude.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.839
That's the stuff that
people usually fall for.

43:11.922 --> 43:15.301
You say it like
you're an expert in this field.

43:22.558 --> 43:23.767
Oops, I forgot.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.187
You have a painful past involving fraud.

43:32.359 --> 43:33.777
Still, this is different.

43:34.653 --> 43:37.781
Have you ever seen a fraud who spends
his own money to save the world?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.854
<i>Deliver justice to Do Young-choon,</i>

44:08.937 --> 44:11.732
the fraud who conned 800 billion won!

44:12.983 --> 44:14.777
<i>Do Young-choon killed my family!</i>

44:14.860 --> 44:16.695
Sentence him to death!

45:24.721 --> 45:27.307
<i>-Punish him!
-Punish him!</i>

45:28.058 --> 45:29.852
Do Young-choon killed my family!

45:29.935 --> 45:33.856
-Sentence Do Young-choon to death!
-Sentence him to death!

45:33.939 --> 45:37.860
-Punish Do Young-choon!
-Punish him!

45:37.943 --> 45:41.822
-Sentence Do Young-choon to death!
-Sentence him to death!

45:42.448 --> 45:45.993
-Punish Do Young-choon!
-Punish him!

45:46.076 --> 45:49.955
-Sentence Do Young-choon to death!
-Sentence him to death!

46:07.848 --> 46:09.141
Here comes Do Young-choon!

47:08.951 --> 47:10.118
<i>Don't.</i>

47:11.203 --> 47:13.455
<i>Don't ruin your life
because of someone like him.</i>

47:14.331 --> 47:16.041
<i>It's not worth it, Ga-on.</i>

48:04.464 --> 48:06.300
<i>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</i>

48:08.885 --> 48:11.680
I'll be discharged soon,
so why bother visiting every day?

48:11.763 --> 48:13.390
It's rather annoying.

48:13.473 --> 48:14.766
What happened to the person

48:14.850 --> 48:17.644
who was grumbling about
why he wasn't here already?

48:18.353 --> 48:21.898
Please respect
your patients' privacy, will you?

48:21.982 --> 48:23.525
Is she out?

48:25.611 --> 48:26.862
Did you?

48:29.072 --> 48:32.451
So what exactly is Kang Yo-han scheming?

48:33.368 --> 48:35.245
Because I think this is a complete fraud.

48:38.790 --> 48:39.833
Well?

48:39.916 --> 48:42.044
Get some rest first.
You need to recover first.

48:42.127 --> 48:45.088
Get rest?
I need to dig into so many things.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.842
There's the tampering of witnesses,
the cathedral fire and Elijah.

48:48.925 --> 48:50.385
How is she?

48:53.889 --> 48:56.892
It must have been so tough.
She was so young and all alone too.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.772
Did she remind you of when I was young?

49:04.191 --> 49:05.817
Hey, you shameless bastard.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.444
How dare you compare yourself
to that pretty little soul?

49:07.527 --> 49:10.739
-Be more objective about yourself.
-Yes, ma'am.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.241
You seem fine. I'll get going now.

49:15.118 --> 49:18.622
That's true, but you're still my guest.
Do you want to eat this before you go?

49:20.499 --> 49:22.459
Su-hyeon, you…

49:23.877 --> 49:26.338
Well, let's see how good you are at
peeling that thing.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.468
All right, here we go.

49:39.851 --> 49:41.019
What are you doing?

50:02.332 --> 50:04.126
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

50:07.838 --> 50:09.172
I'll do it.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.341
When you peel it,
there's hardly anything left.

50:14.386 --> 50:15.929
You're so mean.

50:33.196 --> 50:37.200
<i>It is said more than 20 have come forward
so far with information</i>

50:37.284 --> 50:39.703
<i>regarding the suspicions
surrounding the SRF.</i>

50:39.786 --> 50:42.873
<i>The SRF continues to deny all allegations,</i>

50:42.956 --> 50:45.667
<i>but is yet to make an official statement.</i>

50:45.751 --> 50:48.336
<i>Meanwhile, more than 100,000
signatures were collected</i>

50:48.420 --> 50:49.713
<i>for a protest demanding…</i>

50:51.214 --> 50:53.300
Let's not get distracted,
but get back to work.

50:59.931 --> 51:02.476
Hey, I hear he'll really pay
for whatever you send him.

51:03.935 --> 51:05.604
And the amount is no joke either.

51:05.687 --> 51:06.855
Really?

51:07.689 --> 51:10.358
Maybe I should try it.
I'm a little tight for next month.

51:10.442 --> 51:12.235
You'll be in trouble if you're busted.

51:14.654 --> 51:16.239
<i>Strong support for Kang Yo-han?</i>

51:16.323 --> 51:18.533
Honestly, the opposition party
is such bastards.

51:19.242 --> 51:23.538
They claimed that the <i>Live Court Show</i>
is all to distract the people

51:24.247 --> 51:26.875
and that it may possibly
breach human rights.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.835
But that's what politics is.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.587
Your enemy's enemy is your friend.

51:31.087 --> 51:32.088
Anyway,

51:33.006 --> 51:34.299
you two, over there.

51:34.382 --> 51:36.343
What did you hand over to Kang Yo-han?

51:39.387 --> 51:41.014
It's nothing.

51:41.097 --> 51:43.517
I just threw him something to screw him.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.227
And to screw me too, right?

51:45.310 --> 51:47.687
Hey, what do you take me for?

51:47.771 --> 51:51.149
Anyway, he'll only dig his own grave
if he digs into it deeper and deeper.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.401
Then what about you?

51:53.485 --> 51:55.195
Are you planning to expand into
this industry once I'm gone?

51:55.278 --> 51:56.446
That's not a bad idea.

51:57.405 --> 51:59.241
Do you have to?

51:59.324 --> 52:01.368
-Let go of me!
-Who would be most pleased

52:02.744 --> 52:04.788
to see this situation?

52:07.999 --> 52:10.585
The fortress starts to
crumble from within.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.671
So sort yourselves out
before it's too late.

52:12.754 --> 52:16.675
Judge Kang will strike next without giving
you a chance to turn yourself around.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.225
SIR, JUDGE KANG YO-HAN IS HOLDING
AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE

52:26.476 --> 52:27.686
What is this?

52:30.564 --> 52:33.149
NUMBER OF INFORMANTS

52:37.821 --> 52:39.155
Reports are flooding in.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.367
Many have taken the courage
to step forward

52:42.450 --> 52:46.204
to shed light on the truth.
And thanks to our brave informants,

52:46.288 --> 52:48.498
the Foundation has started
to change its stance.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.750
You all watched the President's
YouTube Live, didn't you?

52:50.834 --> 52:52.419
<i>The man to change Korea totally,</i>

52:52.502 --> 52:55.130
<i>Heo Joong-se!
Yes, the man to solve all your woes!</i>

52:58.633 --> 53:00.677
<i>But there's a bigger surprise.</i>

53:05.056 --> 53:08.184
Two of the Foundation's directors
have given me something

53:08.268 --> 53:09.436
saying that it's to do with the accounts.

53:49.935 --> 53:51.436
<i>And it's very interesting.</i>

53:51.519 --> 53:53.855
Nominating vendors
that are run by their families

53:53.939 --> 53:56.316
and pre-purchasing land
at the proposed project site.

53:57.192 --> 54:00.779
Coincidentally, the information I received
from them run counter to each other,

54:00.862 --> 54:03.239
<i>so I'll have to do some fact-checking.</i>

54:03.323 --> 54:06.242
But that's not all.
Let's take a look at the screen.

54:06.868 --> 54:11.247
THE SRF'S DONATION
TO THE DREAM BASE PROJECT

54:11.331 --> 54:13.333
TOTAL DONATIONS

54:16.252 --> 54:20.715
Where did all these huge donations
by their directors to date?

54:26.972 --> 54:30.725
According to thorough cross-checking
with the Foundation's internal accounts

54:30.809 --> 54:34.604
by Judge Kim Ga-on right here,
the amount claimed to have been donated

54:34.688 --> 54:37.774
and the amount actually received by
the Foundation doesn't match up.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.242
Did you really manage to secure
the Foundation's internal account info?

54:48.868 --> 54:50.036
Yes.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.039
A brave informant has come forward for us.

54:54.165 --> 54:55.667
You say the numbers don't add up.

54:55.750 --> 54:57.502
Does that mean someone
has been embezzling money?

54:57.585 --> 55:01.297
If no one did, then it could only mean
the money was never donated to start with.

55:06.803 --> 55:10.473
Did Judge Kim Ga-on also agree
to join you on this effort?

55:14.728 --> 55:16.229
Yes, he did.

55:17.856 --> 55:19.149
As many of you are aware…

55:21.985 --> 55:23.611
Judge Kim is a man of principles,

55:23.695 --> 55:26.197
sometimes even criticized
for lacking flexibility.

55:26.948 --> 55:29.409
But maybe you didn't know this about him.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.749
HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE
AFTER LOSING THEIR ENTIRE FORTUNE TO FRAUD

55:40.003 --> 55:43.423
This is the story of his parents.

56:03.777 --> 56:06.488
This is the pain and suffering
Judge Kim has overcome.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.532
He could not forgive such hypocrisy

56:09.616 --> 56:12.535
and deceit directed toward
our innocent citizens.

56:18.833 --> 56:21.419
After taking necessary measures
to protect our informants,

56:22.295 --> 56:24.881
I will disclose all the tip-offs
I received.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.885
Right here, in a week's time. Thank you.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.231
Was there an informant
from the Foundation?

56:41.314 --> 56:42.816
Are you personally acquainted with them?

56:42.899 --> 56:45.485
Judge Kim,
is the story about your parents true?

56:54.285 --> 56:55.954
Judge Kim!

56:56.037 --> 56:58.414
Judge Kim, please say a word.

56:58.498 --> 57:02.293
Judge Kim, please say a word. Please wait.

57:02.377 --> 57:06.047
-Judge Kim!
-Judge Kim, please wait.

57:12.804 --> 57:14.180
So that's what it was, was it?

57:15.306 --> 57:17.434
I was just a tool for your show, was I?

57:17.517 --> 57:19.394
How are you different from them?

57:19.477 --> 57:22.439
Is it okay to use
anything and everything for your purpose?

57:22.522 --> 57:24.983
You can't be a shameless lawbreaker,

57:25.066 --> 57:28.528
and a judge is most powerful
when he goes by the law.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.824
Don't you think
you're talking high and mighty?

57:32.907 --> 57:34.659
This is war.

57:35.869 --> 57:37.996
What will you present next week then?

57:38.079 --> 57:40.999
Manipulated accounts?
Reports that don't exist?

57:41.082 --> 57:42.834
Shouldn't we place them

57:43.460 --> 57:46.713
before a true court of justice
even if it's slow and painful?

57:46.796 --> 57:49.424
Really? So you're satisfied, aren't you?

57:49.507 --> 57:53.344
I see you were extremely
touched by the stern ruling of the law

57:53.428 --> 57:55.513
on that fraud who killed your parents.

57:56.306 --> 57:57.265
Shut up!

57:57.348 --> 58:00.393
He was sentenced to 17 years in prison

58:00.477 --> 58:03.104
after the continuously
delayed trials by putting up with

58:03.188 --> 58:06.107
all the trickery of expensive lawyers
and adhering

58:06.191 --> 58:08.318
to all kinds of principles and procedures.

58:08.401 --> 58:10.570
<i>Is that the justice you'd proclaim so far?</i>

58:10.653 --> 58:12.280
Don't you dare speak like that!

58:16.659 --> 58:19.412
The conclusion was reached under the law

58:20.038 --> 58:23.166
despite all the sabotage
and much dilemma by the jurors

58:24.000 --> 58:28.379
who were also ordinary citizens
like my parents. It was fair and square.

58:29.214 --> 58:30.298
That's the system.

58:31.424 --> 58:33.885
Whether you like it or not,
that's what the system is!

58:36.387 --> 58:39.224
I guess the only way
for you to live on was to believe so.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.144
Is that how Yoon Su-hyeon

58:43.228 --> 58:46.606
and Min Jeong-ho had convinced you?
The only two left by your side.

58:47.732 --> 58:51.110
Is that how you'd repressed the urge
to stab him and take your life

58:51.194 --> 58:53.029
with that single belief?

58:56.324 --> 58:57.450
<i>Answer me.</i>

59:00.828 --> 59:02.288
Don't shoot your mouth off.

59:04.290 --> 59:05.750
Who do you think you are?

59:09.671 --> 59:10.880
Who do you think you are?

59:25.019 --> 59:26.896
There's something I'd like to show you.

59:33.611 --> 59:35.947
How the hell…

59:36.030 --> 59:37.824
How the hell did this happen?

59:37.907 --> 59:39.409
There's just no way.

59:39.492 --> 59:41.828
It's impossible to sneak out
the account book.

59:41.911 --> 59:45.039
Can you be responsible for
what you just said?

59:45.123 --> 59:47.584
What if it really were true?

59:47.667 --> 59:49.961
He said he'll reveal it after one week.

59:50.044 --> 59:53.214
The entire country will be watching,
so what are we to do?

59:53.298 --> 59:55.425
-At least we'll have stellar viewership.
-What?

59:57.885 --> 1:00:00.597
-That's enough, you bastard!
-Darn it.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:01.889
Shit!

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:06.102
I play some cards myself
and I'm sure Kang Yo-han is bluffing.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:09.314
He's only acting like that
because he has no cards to play!

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:12.525
I'm sorry, gentlemen,

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:20.074
but Kang Yo-han is to make one
if he doesn't have one.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:23.745
-Without even batting an eye.
-Then we should chop his wrist off!

1:00:23.828 --> 1:00:26.414
This is a big game
with the entire nation watching.

1:00:26.497 --> 1:00:28.958
And it's you three
who let this get out of hand.

1:00:29.834 --> 1:00:32.670
Now, to expose Kang Yo-han's
hand as a dud,

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:34.922
we need to show ours too.

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:37.550
Will you be all right with that?

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:40.887
The issue here isn't
just the exaggerated numbers.

1:00:40.970 --> 1:00:44.390
The total expenses to date
regarding the Dream Base project,

1:00:44.474 --> 1:00:46.851
future plans for fund implementation, and…

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:51.522
the true purpose of the project.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:55.777
-Director Jung!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:58.196
I dared step over the line.

1:00:59.072 --> 1:01:02.492
So? What now?

1:01:02.575 --> 1:01:04.243
How will we sort this out?

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:07.413
We have

1:01:08.831 --> 1:01:11.542
Chairman Seo, don't we?

1:01:28.393 --> 1:01:31.771
DO NOT DISTURB: FAST PRAYERS
IN PROGRESS FOR THE NATION

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:48.121
Does this mean thanks to that Kang Yo-han,

1:01:48.746 --> 1:01:53.084
this old man will once again
have a chance at revival?

1:02:48.848 --> 1:02:50.224
He's here.

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:54.896
-Chairman.
-Chairman!

1:02:58.691 --> 1:03:02.320
Usually we have no way to see you
when you're in meditation.

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:04.989
Thank you for coming all this way for us.

1:03:05.072 --> 1:03:07.658
You've grown haggard.

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:10.411
What is it?

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:14.791
Are your asses on fire
over this recent incident?

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:18.795
Yes. It's a mess, Chairman.

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:21.631
We need to sort this out
before it gets too late.

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:23.883
I can see our staff are starting
to have second thoughts too.

1:03:26.052 --> 1:03:27.553
I will take care of it.

1:03:31.390 --> 1:03:35.645
If you'll step forward for us,
we'll have nothing to worry about!

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:37.146
That's right, Chairman.

1:03:37.230 --> 1:03:40.066
Right now, you're the only one
in this country

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:42.193
who can sort this mess out.

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:44.445
Yes, you're the only one.

1:03:44.529 --> 1:03:47.573
The last true mentor of our generation.

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:50.576
-Our elder.
-Please, you exaggerate too much.

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:55.248
Anyway, once I come forward,

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:57.750
the public, who had been
disillusioned by Kang Yo-han

1:03:57.834 --> 1:04:01.087
and his venomous tongue will soon wake up.

1:04:01.921 --> 1:04:05.383
No need to respond to
every little tiresome rumor.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:07.218
You're absolutely right.

1:04:07.301 --> 1:04:09.470
Because once you have
the control of the flow,

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:12.932
the tables will turn.
That's what public sentiment is!

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:14.141
You're truly admirable.

1:04:14.225 --> 1:04:15.768
Your perception is spot on!

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.645
Still, I must say…

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:20.690
We do need something to throw to them.

1:04:25.111 --> 1:04:26.737
Something to throw to them?

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:31.075
The public will only go quiet
if you put something in their mouth.

1:04:31.742 --> 1:04:34.579
Something to chew and gnaw at.

1:04:36.205 --> 1:04:40.001
Then what do you have in mind?

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:44.255
We all know the perfect person.

1:04:45.631 --> 1:04:49.218
While I withdraw to the prayer room
for the sake of our country,

1:04:50.553 --> 1:04:54.307
she handles all affairs of the Foundation.

1:04:55.224 --> 1:04:56.893
You mean Director Jung?

1:04:58.644 --> 1:05:02.815
But isn't Director Jung
someone who always does

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:04.066
a perfect job?

1:05:04.150 --> 1:05:06.402
Still, she is just a servant in the end.

1:05:06.485 --> 1:05:09.405
Isn't that why we kept her until now?

1:05:12.742 --> 1:05:17.121
Then how should we use
Director Jung, Chairman?

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:21.167
She's not the type to stay put
about becoming the sacrificial lamb.

1:05:22.084 --> 1:05:28.716
That means we'll first need to
make her silent, right?

1:05:29.425 --> 1:05:30.551
Of course.

1:05:31.969 --> 1:05:33.220
Forever.

1:05:34.305 --> 1:05:36.807
So that she carries everything
without a word.

1:05:36.891 --> 1:05:38.267
Do you understand?

1:05:44.148 --> 1:05:45.483
Yes, sir.

1:05:46.359 --> 1:05:47.568
Forever.

1:06:18.099 --> 1:06:19.392
What is this?

1:06:19.475 --> 1:06:20.643
Get out.

1:06:26.732 --> 1:06:29.610
CORRECTIONS FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE

1:07:03.936 --> 1:07:06.230
We're your big fans, Judge Kang.

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:10.568
-We are
-We are

1:07:10.651 --> 1:07:12.653
-the power!
-the power!

1:07:16.365 --> 1:07:17.616
We respect you, Judge Kang.

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:28.002
-We are
-We are

1:07:28.085 --> 1:07:30.129
-the power!
-the power!

1:07:30.212 --> 1:07:32.006
-We are
-We are

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:34.133
-the power!
-the power!

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:36.010
-We are
-We are

1:07:36.093 --> 1:07:37.470
the power!

1:07:58.491 --> 1:08:01.869
Number 70618, Do Young-choon.

1:08:01.952 --> 1:08:03.329
You have visitors in Room 7.

1:08:10.544 --> 1:08:12.463
Do you want to see me losing it?

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:15.841
Or do you want to see me
strangle his neck?

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:20.429
You bastard.

1:08:33.901 --> 1:08:37.154
Number 70618, Do Young-choon.

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:14.108
No.

1:09:14.191 --> 1:09:15.943
This man isn't Do Young-choon.

1:09:16.026 --> 1:09:17.778
He's someone else. Something's wrong.

1:09:18.946 --> 1:09:21.157
He is inmate 70618, Do Young-choon.

1:09:22.366 --> 1:09:23.742
I said he isn't.

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:25.369
This isn't Do Young-choon.

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:26.954
No way.

1:09:28.539 --> 1:09:29.790
This is someone else.

1:09:29.874 --> 1:09:33.335
Sentenced to 17 years
under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment

1:09:33.419 --> 1:09:34.879
of Specific Economic Crimes.

1:09:34.962 --> 1:09:36.797
Name, Do Young-choon.

1:09:46.932 --> 1:09:49.810
Well, I don't know what your story is,

1:09:49.894 --> 1:09:54.356
but his prison number, RRN,
and date of incarceration are all correct.

1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:02.323
Never…

1:10:04.533 --> 1:10:07.161
not for one day,
have I forgotten his face.

1:10:11.749 --> 1:10:14.001
No. This is someone else.

1:10:15.085 --> 1:10:16.378
Sir.

1:10:16.462 --> 1:10:19.298
Why are you in there? Sir!

1:10:19.381 --> 1:10:20.925
Sir, why are you in there?

1:10:21.008 --> 1:10:22.885
Get out of there. Sir!

1:10:47.993 --> 1:10:49.119
Let's go.

1:11:37.376 --> 1:11:40.838
Only the system allows
for such complete manipulation.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:43.007
This is called the system.

1:11:43.966 --> 1:11:46.343
And the system is powerless
in front of authority.

1:11:47.553 --> 1:11:50.806
It's the authority
that can wrap it around its finger.

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:01.353
-You were out, were you?
-Oh, no.

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:05.065
I was just getting some fresh air.

1:14:05.858 --> 1:14:06.942
Gosh.

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:11.155
You'll catch a cold at your age.

1:14:11.738 --> 1:14:13.240
Don't you have weak knees too?

1:14:13.323 --> 1:14:15.367
Oh no, I'm just fine.

1:14:31.842 --> 1:14:33.343
You've sure aged.

1:14:36.972 --> 1:14:38.015
Is it because of me?

1:14:39.224 --> 1:14:42.853
Because I got you
by the balls and harassed you?

1:14:44.813 --> 1:14:45.772
Not at all.

1:14:46.899 --> 1:14:48.901
It's a price I must pay for my sin.

1:14:50.652 --> 1:14:53.280
So how could I dare blame another?

1:14:55.532 --> 1:14:56.450
Really?

1:14:59.912 --> 1:15:04.666
Wow, that's really amazing.
I'd blame me if I were you.

1:15:05.834 --> 1:15:08.003
I guess great minds are different.

1:15:13.425 --> 1:15:14.676
Do you remember?

1:15:15.427 --> 1:15:18.931
When I first came here to serve you…

1:15:20.265 --> 1:15:22.809
I'd been so young too.

1:15:24.311 --> 1:15:25.312
Yes.

1:15:26.313 --> 1:15:27.272
You were.

1:15:29.233 --> 1:15:30.776
So why did you?

1:15:33.237 --> 1:15:34.863
Why did you do that

1:15:37.241 --> 1:15:39.326
to a little girl
who had nowhere else to go?

1:15:56.718 --> 1:15:59.012
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

1:16:00.222 --> 1:16:02.349
I never had the chance to cry myself.

1:16:13.151 --> 1:16:14.486
Get up.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:47.436
Let's stop here.

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:51.356
I'll forgive you.

1:16:53.025 --> 1:16:54.151
What?

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:58.780
Yes, because you are a noble person,

1:16:58.864 --> 1:17:00.699
someone who'll salvage our country.

1:17:02.242 --> 1:17:04.244
It's all been agreed upon.

1:17:15.797 --> 1:17:17.007
Quiet.

1:17:18.592 --> 1:17:19.718
It's okay.

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:21.970
Everything will work out.

1:17:24.139 --> 1:17:28.435
You'll die as the honorable Chairman Seo.

1:17:29.561 --> 1:17:31.063
Which is more than you deserve.

1:17:31.855 --> 1:17:33.649
Much more than

1:17:35.108 --> 1:17:38.195
a filthy pig like you ever deserves!

1:18:17.234 --> 1:18:20.946
<i>Chairman Seo Jeong-hak
of the SRF has passed away.</i>

1:18:21.029 --> 1:18:22.864
It has been reported that
Chairman Seo took his own life,

1:18:22.948 --> 1:18:25.200
assuming all responsibilities
for the recent suspicions

1:18:25.283 --> 1:18:27.327
surrounding the embezzlement
of the donations.

1:18:27.411 --> 1:18:29.830
While the real culprits
at the Foundation had fled

1:18:29.913 --> 1:18:31.873
after destroying all evidence,

1:18:31.957 --> 1:18:36.336
the Chairman, lamenting the truth,
chose to bear the Cross by himself.

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:39.715
<i>The entire country is mourning
at the news of his death,</i>

1:18:39.798 --> 1:18:42.718
<i>who had dedicated his entire life
to salvaging the poor</i>

1:18:42.801 --> 1:18:44.761
<i>and promoting our national spirit.</i>

1:18:49.683 --> 1:18:52.728
May I now invite on stage,
Director Jung Seon-a,

1:18:52.811 --> 1:18:56.440
our new leader
of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

1:20:29.533 --> 1:20:33.203
THANK YOU TO JUNG EUN-PYO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:21:00.897 --> 1:21:03.191
<i>I worked so hard to go back to it.</i>

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:08.154
<i>The owner of the world
you kicked me out of.</i>

1:21:08.238 --> 1:21:11.575
<i>A monster that's been freed from its rein
will not choose to stop.</i>

1:21:11.658 --> 1:21:13.118
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

1:21:14.202 --> 1:21:15.203
<i>The show must go on</i>

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:17.539
<i>since our only weapon
is the public's support.</i>

1:21:17.622 --> 1:21:18.790
What could be Kang Yo-han's intention?

1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:20.917
You meant to show him living comfortably

1:21:21.001 --> 1:21:22.919
to provoke me, didn't you?

1:21:23.003 --> 1:21:24.796
Remove him if he's a risk.

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:27.591
<i>You're just like me, Young Master.</i>

1:21:27.674 --> 1:21:29.551
Is that why you like me?

1:21:31.177 --> 1:21:35.557
