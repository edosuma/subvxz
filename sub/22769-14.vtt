♪♪

00:05.790 --> 00:08.540
Baymax, you can't just go around
giving foot massages.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.460
Especially
to Professor Granville.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.210
I was treating her
metatarsal inflammation.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.500
What's with the decorations?

00:18.500 --> 00:22.460
They're for Rivalry Week!
Feel the school pride, Hiro.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.000
-Feel it all over you.
-Oh, okay.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.670
What is Rivalry Week?

00:26.670 --> 00:30.460
Ah, good question, Baymax.
Rivalry Week is the week

00:30.460 --> 00:32.330
where...
we take on our rivals.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.540
-We have rivals?
-Yeah!

00:34.540 --> 00:37.790
The San Fransokyo
Art Institute!

00:37.790 --> 00:39.620
SFAI?
What do we have
against SFAI?

00:39.620 --> 00:41.670
Oh, I don't know,
only everything.

00:41.670 --> 00:45.380
It's the classic clash
of ideals: objective
versus subjective.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.830
Rational versus emotional.

00:46.830 --> 00:50.080
Our superior school mascot,
me, versus their terrible one,

00:50.080 --> 00:51.460
Sabatini the Sea Snail!

00:51.460 --> 00:52.500
It's a tradition.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.830
Every year we play pranks
on each other.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.580
What kind of pranks?

00:55.580 --> 00:57.210
They always paint
our dining hall.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.920
Last year they turned it
into a zombie clown circus.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.670
(shudder)
I could not eat there
for weeks.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.540
While we use
our sciencing skills,
of which I have none,

01:05.540 --> 01:07.620
to steal their
Lenore Shimamoto statue!

01:07.620 --> 01:09.170
Yeah. We once got it
using a flock

01:09.170 --> 01:10.670
of genetically
engineered pigeons.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.710
That was pretty cool.

01:11.710 --> 01:13.420
Nerd-school mischief?
I'm in.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.670
We are gonna plan
the ultimate statue grab!

01:16.670 --> 01:19.080
Wait, hold on.
Where's Honey Lemon?

01:22.420 --> 01:24.040
Excellent work, Honey Lemon.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.250
I truly think you're SFAI's
most gifted new student.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.380

02:03.460 --> 02:05.460
to become
a full-time student here?

02:05.460 --> 02:06.540
I'd love to, but I can't.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.790
Art is just a secret hobby
for me.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.210
I-- I mean a secret.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.330
I mean-- I mean a hobby.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.460
Well, hobby or not,
Miss Lemon, your work

02:12.460 --> 02:15.080
is going up in the Fine Arts
Department gallery.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.290
Oh my gosh!
I'm so honored.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.290
And now we step
into the private residence

02:19.290 --> 02:23.670
of renowned artist
and SFAI founder,
Lenore Shimamoto!

02:23.670 --> 02:26.580
-The restoration is finished?
-Today's the grand opening!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.540
But that's 27 days early!

02:28.540 --> 02:30.790
I know!
I was so moved that I wept!

02:30.790 --> 02:34.920
Then I mixed my tears
with ink and wrote a poem
about my feelings.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.210
Read it later.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.290
Okay.

02:41.080 --> 02:46.040
Remember, folks...
no touching and absolutely
no flash photography.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.500
Where are you hiding?

02:56.420 --> 02:57.500
-(thump)
-Aah!

02:59.250 --> 03:00.460
(glasses breaking)

03:06.420 --> 03:07.580
Ah!

03:07.580 --> 03:08.620
And we're moving.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.500
(video game beeps)

03:16.580 --> 03:17.920
Great.
So we hit SFAI tonight.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.830
Tonight?
You're taking the Shimamoto
statue tonight tonight?

03:21.830 --> 03:23.710
We get them
before they get us.

03:23.710 --> 03:25.540
But do we really need
to steal the statue?

03:25.540 --> 03:27.040
I mean, it's been done.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.120
-Right?
-Well, yeah,
but it's tradition.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.670
Who are we
to mess with tradition?

03:30.670 --> 03:31.960
Back me up here, Baymax.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.710
Rivalry Week
began in 1916.

03:34.710 --> 03:38.170
-Students used
a catapult and--
-(door opens)

03:38.170 --> 03:40.960
That is why covalent bonds
share electron pairs!

03:40.960 --> 03:42.420
Super interesting, heh.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.710
Let me guess.
Instead of studying,

03:44.710 --> 03:46.830
you're planning
the statue grab.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.620
Well, it's not going to happen.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.960
-Whew.
-Without my approval,
which you now have.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.750
Tonight, art
will feel the wrath of science!

03:57.750 --> 04:00.790
You two, meet me
at the dining hall
in one hour.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.540
You're going to help me
guard it.

04:02.540 --> 04:03.620
(gulp)

04:10.290 --> 04:11.380
(gasp)

04:12.380 --> 04:14.540
(Hiro grunting)

04:18.460 --> 04:21.080
Guys!
We can just use the door,
since it's open.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.580
Which is how I found it.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.920
So lucky, right?

04:23.920 --> 04:26.210
Baymax:
This route will be easier.

04:26.210 --> 04:28.790
-I'm stuck.
-(grunting)

04:28.790 --> 04:29.790
Thank you.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.040
Fred:
I have mixed feelings
right now.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.040
Guarding the dining hall
is important,

04:38.040 --> 04:40.250
but I was lookin' forward
to that heist.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.290
I just have one feeling. Fear.

04:42.290 --> 04:43.670
-Granville scares me.
-Granville: Good.

04:43.670 --> 04:44.830
(Fred and Wasabi scream)

04:44.830 --> 04:47.330
Fear keeps you sharp.
Suit up!

04:48.500 --> 04:50.210
We've got work to do.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.580
(laughs)
Oh, yes!

04:53.580 --> 04:57.290
Wasabi!
We're gonna be camo twins!

04:57.290 --> 04:59.000
This is a whole new side
of Granville.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.460
A very disturbing side.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.790
Um, do we
have to go through
the Fine Arts building?

05:06.790 --> 05:09.670
This is the best route
to take if we wanna avoid
campus security.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.580
Also, you can enjoy
the student art exhibits
on display.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.750
Student... exhibits?

05:14.750 --> 05:18.420
Your work
is going up in the Fine Arts
Department gallery...

05:18.420 --> 05:20.710
(voice slowed down)
Miss Lemon!

05:20.710 --> 05:23.620
-(gasp)
-Look, if you'd rather
wait here...

05:23.620 --> 05:25.960
No! I mean...
I'm here to help!

05:25.960 --> 05:27.580
I love being helpful!

05:27.580 --> 05:30.380

and pitch of your speech

05:30.380 --> 05:33.460

-How excited I am
about helping!

05:33.460 --> 05:35.290
Uh, sure.

05:54.210 --> 05:55.250
(gasp)

05:58.080 --> 06:02.460
Oh, yes, gettin' a good
stretch in.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.540
Oh!

06:08.500 --> 06:09.750
(objects hitting canvas)

06:09.750 --> 06:13.290
Modern art.
So weird, right?

06:20.330 --> 06:23.830
Modern art is weird.
And messy.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.710
You two will be guarding
the north side

06:31.710 --> 06:32.670
of the dining hall.

06:32.670 --> 06:34.580
(gasp) Whistles?

06:34.580 --> 06:37.250
Oh-ho-ho, nobody's trusted me
with a whistle in years.

06:37.250 --> 06:42.750
(blowing whistle)

06:49.420 --> 06:52.790
One toot means
"I need assistance."

06:52.790 --> 06:55.960
Two toots means
"I've apprehended
an intruder."

06:55.960 --> 06:58.920
Three means,
"I've been captured."

06:58.920 --> 07:01.040
-Four means--
-How many signals
are there?

07:01.040 --> 07:03.580
-Twenty-two.
-Yeah, I'm gonna need
to take notes--

07:03.580 --> 07:05.670
You won't have time
to consult notes

07:05.670 --> 07:06.920
in the heat of battle!

07:06.920 --> 07:08.880
Don't worry,
I have a photographic, uh...

07:08.880 --> 07:12.250
ahh, what's the word
for the thing in your head

07:12.250 --> 07:14.170
that remembers stuff?

07:14.170 --> 07:15.830
Oh, it's right there.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.250
-It's right there!
-Memory.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.670
Uh, no, but it sounds
like that.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.710
I'm counting on you, Wasabi.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.920
(gulp)
Got it.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.670
(crickets chirping)

07:34.880 --> 07:36.290
Keep watch.
We should be ready

07:36.290 --> 07:38.040
to tunnel the statue out
in no time.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.710
So, this is your first time
on SFAI campus, too, right?

07:46.710 --> 07:47.830
Right?
Because it's definitely mine.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.330
Are you acting weird tonight

07:49.330 --> 07:51.170
because you don't want anyone
to know you take classes here?

07:51.170 --> 07:54.000
Wait!
You knew? How?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.250
You sleeptalk.

07:55.250 --> 07:58.960
Ssh!
I'm taking art classes
at SFAI.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.580
It's a secret.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.710
(snoring)
Go Go, Go Go...

08:03.710 --> 08:05.170
Don't tell anyone, okay?

08:05.170 --> 08:08.120
It's a secret.
(snoring)

08:09.250 --> 08:10.790
Hey! Who's there?

08:12.420 --> 08:13.790
-Go Go:
We gotta go.
-We're not done yet!

08:13.790 --> 08:15.380
Security guard:
I heard somethin' over here!

08:15.380 --> 08:16.460
We'll finish later.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.330
What do we do now?

08:29.670 --> 08:32.420
I'm hiding
in Lenore Shimamoto's house.
This is so exciting!

08:32.420 --> 08:34.790
Shh!
Be excited quieter!

08:40.120 --> 08:41.420
(sigh)

08:42.920 --> 08:43.920
(sigh)

08:44.920 --> 08:46.420
Oops.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.210
-I didn't mean to--
-(clanking sound)

08:48.210 --> 08:50.540
Uhh... what's going on?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.540
Oh, no.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.120
(gasp)

09:08.830 --> 09:09.830
(gasp)

09:12.580 --> 09:14.040
What is this place?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.920
You mean, besides creepy?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
It appears to be a science lab.

09:24.170 --> 09:25.580
(whispers)
You guys!

09:25.580 --> 09:28.210
I think this lab
belonged to Lenore Shimamoto!

09:28.210 --> 09:29.710
I thought she was an artist.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.250
Cool.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.960
She was an artist.
With a secret lab.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.580
Someone who was good
at art... and science?

09:38.580 --> 09:40.460
Wow... what are the odds?

09:40.460 --> 09:41.960
These books are all elements.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.880
And they're placed in order
of the Periodic Table from 1906.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.210
But Gallium is supposed to go
before Germanium.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.330
-(click)
-(gasp)

09:57.250 --> 09:58.920
It was an accident.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.120
This is Lenore Shimamoto's
personal journal!

10:08.120 --> 10:10.750
-(radio chatter)
-What are you doin'
down there?

10:10.750 --> 10:13.000
We're exploring a secret lab.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.670
You know, Wasabi,
if you would like me

10:15.670 --> 10:17.960
to hold your whistle,
I mean, I'd be happy to.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.120
Granville revoked
your whistle privileges.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.380
If you even touch a whistle,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.540
I am to signal her
with 23 toots.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.250
But I want it!
(screams)

10:26.250 --> 10:29.920
Question:
What good is camouflage
in front of a wall?

10:31.580 --> 10:33.830
-Well, they're very soft
on the skin--
-None!

10:33.830 --> 10:35.080
Hit the bushes!

10:36.420 --> 10:39.330
Okay, we'll--
where'd she go?

10:39.330 --> 10:40.960
Granville's voice:
I'm nowhere.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.620
(whispers)
Yet... everywhere!

10:46.080 --> 10:48.040
Breaking... trespassing
SFIT pranksters

10:48.040 --> 10:50.920
discover Lenore Shimamoto's
secret lab.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.880
An artist with a lab.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.170
What's that about?

10:56.620 --> 10:57.620
(beeps)

10:59.420 --> 11:02.750
(beeping)

11:06.920 --> 11:10.750
(yawn)
Wow, I'm super tired.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.080
Gonna dive into bed.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.040
And dive into the old book
you swiped from the lab?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.960
So? Are we gonna
read it or what?

11:19.120 --> 11:22.120
April 19th, 1905.
My friends in the arts

11:22.120 --> 11:23.210
know nothing about...

11:23.210 --> 11:24.790
Lenore Shimamoto:
...my scientific endeavors.

11:24.790 --> 11:26.670
They would not understand
what drives me.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.120
I'm not sure
I understand.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.380
Until I can be certain
of success, I've decided it bes

11:32.380 --> 11:34.250
to keep
my scientific work secret.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.000
November 11th, 1905.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.040
While my research
has been fascinating,

11:40.040 --> 11:43.120
my isolation
grows more stifling.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.170
April 3rd, 1906.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.710
I've made
a groundbreaking discovery
too big to hide.

11:47.710 --> 11:50.960
Tomorrow I will show the city..
and change the world!

11:50.960 --> 11:52.500
That's all she wrote.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.000
The rest of the pages
are just... empty!

11:55.000 --> 11:58.120
-That's it?
So she chickened out.
-Maybe... or--

11:58.120 --> 11:59.420
Look at that last date.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.380
It was the day before
the Great Catastrophe.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.420
Maybe all the chaos
ruined her plans, and she never
had the courage to try again.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.080
(sigh)

12:07.080 --> 12:10.080
What if her discovery
really could've changed
the world?

12:10.080 --> 12:12.420
Wow. This is like
an actual mystery.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.250
I know...
and I'm gonna solve it!

12:15.250 --> 12:18.080
Before I return the journal
tomorrow, I have to re-read it.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.540
There's something I'm missing.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.250
(sigh)

12:32.120 --> 12:34.540
(yawn)
How many toots
for snack time?

12:34.540 --> 12:36.330
That wasn't on the list.
Was it?

12:36.330 --> 12:39.210
-(blowing whistle)
-Professor Granville's
tooting at us!

12:39.210 --> 12:42.120
-(whistling stops)
-Was that eight toots?

12:42.120 --> 12:44.080
Or was it
four toots twice?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.790
-(rustling noise)
-What was that?

12:45.790 --> 12:48.500
Relax, it's probably
just a family
of baby deer.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.040
Number one,
I've never seen deer
on campus.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.750
Number two,
why would the entire family
be babies, Fred?

12:54.750 --> 12:55.750
Why?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.580
(both scream)

12:59.580 --> 13:02.620
Fred (yelling):
Sabatini!

13:06.170 --> 13:09.290
Excuse me, Miss?
I'm from the museum.

13:09.290 --> 13:12.210
-Oh! Hi.
-I recognized you
from the news,

13:12.210 --> 13:15.290
and I wanted to talk to you
about the discovery you made.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.500
It was...
it was amazing.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.460
Indeed.
Historians, like myself,

13:20.460 --> 13:24.790
will spend ages
studying everything
in Shimamoto's lab.

13:24.790 --> 13:27.580
If only we could hear
in her own words

13:27.580 --> 13:31.290
why she hid her scientific work
from the world.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.920
Well, actually, you can.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.620
Shimamoto's journal.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.290
I took it last night.
I swear I was gonna
return it.

13:38.290 --> 13:41.120
It's just... she's my idol.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.170
I have to confess,
if I'd been in your shoes...

13:44.170 --> 13:46.040
I might've done
the same thing.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.380
Wasabi:
I'm sorry, Professor Granville.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.960
The artists got to us
before we could get
to our whistles!

13:52.960 --> 13:55.750
And they wouldn't
give us snacks!

13:55.750 --> 13:58.580
Gentlemen,
this isn't your fault.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.500
It's mine.

14:00.500 --> 14:05.120
-Really?
-A scientist must always
acknowledge her own failings.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.880
I did not
prepare you adequately.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.620
That's very reasonable of you.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.380
I won't make that mistake again.

14:11.380 --> 14:14.790
We start training for next year
at six a.m. tomorrow!

14:14.790 --> 14:19.210
-Great.
-Until then,
stew in your failure.

14:19.210 --> 14:22.040
Hey, Wasabi, do you think
she's going to get stuff
to cut us down?

14:22.040 --> 14:23.750
Wasabi:
Pretty sure she's not.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.250
Clerk:
Next.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.290
-Next.
-Hi. Can you tell me

14:29.290 --> 14:31.580
where the Shimamoto journal
is being displayed?

14:31.580 --> 14:34.420
No idea what
you're talkin' about. Next.

14:34.420 --> 14:37.460
Oh.
Your associate,
Mr. Herman Ekabo,

14:37.460 --> 14:38.790
should've brought it in
this morning?

14:38.790 --> 14:41.710
No one works here
named Herman Ekabo.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.080
(buzzing)

14:47.080 --> 14:50.920
Ugh!
I can't believe I let a stranger
steal a priceless treasure!

14:50.920 --> 14:53.290
-(buzzing continues)
-Uh, wrong ID.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.750
I... don't have
my SFIT ID.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.420
I'll do it.
Wait-- I don't have
a student ID, either.

15:00.420 --> 15:02.080
But I'll just use
my mascot ID!

15:02.080 --> 15:03.420
And... there's no such thing.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.670
I don't have my SFIT ID

15:05.670 --> 15:08.830
because I left it
in the journal
last night!

15:08.830 --> 15:10.420
Which means
we can track the journal

15:10.420 --> 15:12.750
using your ID's RFID chip!

15:12.750 --> 15:14.120
Which means let's move!

15:16.080 --> 15:18.420
So we're not having lunch.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.580
Baymax:
RFID scan indicates
that Honey Lemon's ID

15:21.580 --> 15:23.170
is inside this building.

15:23.170 --> 15:26.080
Why does it always
have to be abandoned
warehouses?

15:26.080 --> 15:27.620
It's part of Bad Guy 101.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.380
Right next
to use fake credentials
to steal things.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.580
Tell me he did not
have a fake beard.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.960
'Cause that's the trifecta.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.500
Trifecta!

15:37.500 --> 15:39.250
Did you pick up
anything else, Baymax?

15:39.250 --> 15:41.960
Yes, there is one person inside.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.170
His body temperature
is low normal.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.380
It's him!
And he's got the journal!

15:49.790 --> 15:51.580
Welcome, Big Hero 6.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.670
I'd hoped you'd
locate me more quickly.

15:53.670 --> 15:54.830
Disappointing.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.750
Mr. Ekabo,
or whoever you are,

15:56.750 --> 15:58.790
you stole
Shimamoto's journal.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.750
Wrong.
I only claimed that which
belongs with the one

16:01.750 --> 16:04.040
who understands its true worth.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.330
I understand.
I think.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.330
-Please.
-Hey, uh... who are you?

16:09.330 --> 16:12.250
I need one more minute.
Which is perfect.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.330
Because that's all the time
you have.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.000
Good luck!

16:25.420 --> 16:27.540
Whoa!
This is just like
my room!

16:27.540 --> 16:29.000
Except for that thing.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.830
Nice try, mystery villain.

16:30.830 --> 16:33.960
Wasabi: "The hardest thing
to face is yourself."

16:33.960 --> 16:35.580
What does it mean?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.420
Well, this is creepy.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.330
Baymax:
It is a replica
of your bedroom.

16:39.330 --> 16:42.420
-Why is that creepy?
-I'll explain later.

16:42.420 --> 16:45.000
"Find the whole solution
to your problem"?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.750
It looks just like
Shimamoto's lab.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.500
Go Go: "Don't ignore
the pressing from the wall."

16:50.500 --> 16:52.210
That doesn't sound good.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.580
Maybe it's not so bad.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.330
(beeping)

16:57.540 --> 16:58.920
Never mind.
It's bad.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.460
(grunts)

17:16.960 --> 17:18.080
Both:
Ah!

17:18.080 --> 17:20.500
(beeping)

17:23.250 --> 17:25.960
Oh, face yourself!
Got it.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.000
Still don't get it.
But that's cool.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.250
Let's do this!

17:31.120 --> 17:33.330
-Oh, man!
-Water. Creepy.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.960
Baymax,
break through the wall!

17:38.210 --> 17:39.500
Oh, come on, really?

17:39.500 --> 17:42.170
(grunting)

17:43.210 --> 17:44.420
Isn't working!

17:45.580 --> 17:48.880
It's like he is me!

17:48.880 --> 17:51.540
Wait!
What if I'm actually
the robot clone?

17:51.540 --> 17:52.710
And I don't know it!

17:52.710 --> 17:56.210
Oh-ho-ho, I'm freakin'
myself out right now, Wasabi!

18:00.460 --> 18:02.210
Guys?
Any ideas?

18:04.460 --> 18:07.000
(both grunting)

18:09.420 --> 18:10.960
It's pressing from the wall!

18:10.960 --> 18:13.170
Yeah, we got that part.

18:13.170 --> 18:14.620
No, it's a play on words.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.750
The plant
pressing from the wall.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.670
Guys!

18:24.670 --> 18:27.080
The words on the wall...
they all have a double meaning!

18:27.080 --> 18:28.920
"Find the whole solution."

18:28.920 --> 18:30.420
Wait a minute.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.380
No, I'm pretty sure
ours just has one meaning!

18:33.380 --> 18:34.960
This is hard!

18:34.960 --> 18:36.330
Honey Lemon:
If facing yourself
is the hardest thing,

18:36.330 --> 18:37.880
do something else!

18:37.880 --> 18:39.250
Both:
Switch!

18:46.420 --> 18:47.540
(cheering)

18:47.540 --> 18:49.750
-All right!
-Oh, yeah!

18:49.750 --> 18:51.080
I have an idea.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.380
Hope I'm right.
(deep inhale)

19:12.790 --> 19:14.460
It was a riddle.
Get it?

19:14.460 --> 19:16.580
-No.
-A play on words!

19:16.580 --> 19:19.210
The "whole solution"
was a hole in the floor.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.290
Y-- You know?

19:21.830 --> 19:23.330
No.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.750
Yeah, we'll talk later.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.540
Let's go.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.290
Oh. Hominem!

19:32.830 --> 19:34.460
Clever and creative.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.920
Now I'm mildly impressed.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.500
Why are you doing this?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.540
Let's call that
one more riddle to solve.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.250
Perhaps for next time.
(snaps fingers)

19:42.250 --> 19:43.710
Big Hero 6:
Ohh!

19:51.500 --> 19:52.580
Where'd he go?

19:55.620 --> 19:56.670
Wasabi:
He's gone!

19:56.670 --> 19:57.830
Who was that guy?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.000
Hmm, I think
I'll call him Puzzle Master.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.960
Ooh!
Or what about Glowface?

20:03.620 --> 20:06.000
Hey!
If he didn't supervillain
name himself,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.710
I call dibs, okay?

20:07.710 --> 20:08.500
Why go through
all that trouble

20:08.500 --> 20:10.170
for the journal
and then leave it?

20:10.170 --> 20:11.960
I'm just relieved
we got it back.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.080
This is going straight
to the museum!

20:15.920 --> 20:17.290
Obake.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.080
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you guys
that I'm an art student.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.170
It's okay.
Also, we knew.

20:27.170 --> 20:29.580
You all knew?

20:29.580 --> 20:31.250
Why didn't you say anything?

20:31.250 --> 20:32.540
We figured you were

20:32.540 --> 20:33.670
keeping it a secret
for a reason.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.540
And that you'd tell us
in your own time.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.380
We're your friends,
Honey Lemon.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.750
We accept all of you.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.580
Thanks.
I love chemistry,

20:40.580 --> 20:43.460
but I think
I love art just as much.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.790
So, even though I know
you see the artists
at this school

20:45.790 --> 20:47.880
as the enemy,
I'm sticking with it.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.080
-Actually, we don't
really hate SFAI.
-Except for Sabatini.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.750
I loathe him!

20:52.750 --> 20:55.000
It's his empty,
soulless eyes.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.670
He doesn't mean
any of the spirit
he conveys.

20:57.670 --> 21:00.580
Honestly, the trash talk
just made the statue grab
more fun.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.460
Take that, Sabatini!

21:10.540 --> 21:13.670
(beeping)

21:16.710 --> 21:20.290
No. No... no, no.

21:20.290 --> 21:21.920
Hmm...

21:24.750 --> 21:28.120
(beeping)

21:28.120 --> 21:31.380
Now, where to begin?

21:36.080 --> 21:39.120
(theme music playing)
