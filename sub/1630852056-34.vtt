WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.032
She published
pictures of me to the internet.

00:03.100 --> 00:05.432
- And then I also have...
- Shh, shh.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.099
Pictures of her that were private.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.800
That's a lie.

00:08.867 --> 00:10.099
Wow.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.166
That is most unprofessional.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.400
[Nefertiti]
She said that she would want to...

00:13.467 --> 00:16.265
If you interrupt again,
I'm just gonna dismiss your case.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.332
That's it.

00:17.399 --> 00:20.432
[announcer]
This is Judy Justice.

00:36.366 --> 00:41.200
Nefertiti Abdullah is suing
her former friend, Larisha Stone,

00:41.265 --> 00:45.466
for the balance of coaching services
and defamation of character.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.500
[Kevin] Court come to order.
All rise.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.366
- Have a seat, please.
- [Kevin] Hello, Judge.

00:50.432 --> 00:52.799
We have case number 1049,
Abdullah versus Stone.

00:52.866 --> 00:53.866
Thank you, Kevin.

00:53.933 --> 00:57.332
Ms. Abdullah, it is your claim
that the defendant owes the balance

00:57.399 --> 01:00.466
of a bill to you for life coaching.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.133
Health coaching and meal planning.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.332
And in addition to the balance
that she owes you for six weeks'

01:06.400 --> 01:11.165
worth of classes or mentoring,
you alleged that she defamed you

01:11.233 --> 01:12.233
on the internet.

01:12.299 --> 01:15.466
The defendant says
that you did practically nothing for her

01:15.533 --> 01:19.265
for which she paid you $400
of a $600 bill,

01:19.332 --> 01:20.700
and she has a counterclaim.

01:20.766 --> 01:24.734
And the counterclaim is for invasion
of her privacy and defamation.

01:24.799 --> 01:27.667
She says that you posted things
on the internet,

01:27.734 --> 01:30.734
pictures of her that were private pictures
that she sent to you

01:30.799 --> 01:32.933
as part of your health program.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.133
- Yes, ma'am.
- How did you meet each other?

01:35.200 --> 01:38.633
We met at a spiritual event
in September of 2019.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.866
She came to another event
that I was speaking

01:40.933 --> 01:42.700
at in November of 2019.

01:42.766 --> 01:43.766
So you were a speaker?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.734
[Larisha] In the November event,
yes, ma'am.

01:45.799 --> 01:47.500
That's not completely accurate,
Your Honor.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.933
Do you recall
the circumstances of your meeting?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.466
Larisha and I were initiated
into a spiritual group together,

01:53.533 --> 01:55.200
otherwise known as an e-lay.

01:55.265 --> 01:58.265
- We share the same spiritual godmother.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

01:58.332 --> 02:01.200
- And it was a spiritual group?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:01.266 --> 02:05.733
How much after you met
Ms. Stone did you and Ms. Abdullah

02:05.799 --> 02:09.332
become involved in this health coaching?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.866
Well, we met in September of 2019.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.599
Nefertiti was overweight.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.199
She was walking with a cane.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.400
And she had a host of health issues.

02:17.466 --> 02:21.300
So for the span of time
that I knew her from September 2019

02:21.366 --> 02:25.165
to around November of 2019
when I hired her as a health coach,

02:25.233 --> 02:27.265
I watched her get her weight
under control,

02:27.332 --> 02:30.599
stop walking with her cane,
and she was healthy.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.933
- She got her health on track.
- That's a lie. I've never had a cane.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
[Judge Judy]
Just a second.

02:33.066 --> 02:34.066
I've never had a cane, Your Honor.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.133
- If you-- if you interrupt...
- [Larisha] Wow.

02:35.199 --> 02:37.033
If you interrupt again,
I'm just gonna dismiss your case.

02:37.099 --> 02:39.500
- [Nefertiti] I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I want-- that's it.

02:39.567 --> 02:40.599
[Nefertiti] Okay.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.667
[Larisha] Ma'am,
I don't know why she's telling you...

02:41.734 --> 02:43.165
[Judge Judy]
Just a sec. I'm listening to you.

02:43.233 --> 02:45.400
- Yes, Your Honor.
- She's not going to interrupt again.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.699
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.834
So you saw that she, for some reason,
got herself in shape?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.000
[Larisha] She was-- yes.

02:51.066 --> 02:53.165
She got herself in shape.
I was inspired.

02:53.233 --> 02:56.900
And prior to hiring her
as my health coach,

02:56.966 --> 03:00.766
she asked me to start
a health coaching business with her.

03:00.834 --> 03:03.366
So we started a business together non...

03:03.432 --> 03:04.866
[Judge Judy] Explain that to me.

03:04.933 --> 03:08.933
First of all, did you have
any particular education or expertise

03:09.000 --> 03:11.032
in being a health coach for anybody,
you personally?

03:11.099 --> 03:13.133
No, ma'am. No, ma'am.
Not me personally, no.

03:13.199 --> 03:15.032
[Judge Judy] Okay. And prior

03:15.099 --> 03:19.466
to September of 2019, Ms. Abdullah,

03:19.533 --> 03:22.066
did you have any training

03:22.133 --> 03:25.766
or education in the health field?

03:25.834 --> 03:26.966
- [Nefertiti] Yes, ma'am.
- Where?

03:27.033 --> 03:29.800
I've been a Doctor
of Clinical Pharmacy for 16 years.

03:29.866 --> 03:31.233
- I got my degree...
- Oh, it's just-- it's just...

03:31.300 --> 03:33.699
- [Nefertiti] Sorry.
- You're a doctor of...

03:33.766 --> 03:35.400
Clinical Pharmacy.
And I also have...

03:35.466 --> 03:37.466
Now, what's a doctor
of Clinical Pharmacy?

03:37.533 --> 03:38.866
[Nefertiti] A Pharm D.
I'm a clinical pharmacist.

03:38.933 --> 03:41.432
I do medication therapy reviews
with senior citizens

03:41.500 --> 03:42.800
in the State of Florida.

03:42.866 --> 03:44.933
I also work with diabetic patients.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.699
I'm a diabetic educator.

03:46.766 --> 03:47.766
- Okay.
- [Nefertiti] Um...

03:47.834 --> 03:49.233
And where did you get your degree from?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.133
- The University of Florida.
- [Judge Judy] When?

03:51.199 --> 03:53.466
In 2005, April 2005.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.099
Are you licensed anywhere?

03:55.165 --> 03:56.432
- Absolutely. I'm licensed...
- Where?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.300
...in the State of Florida
and the State of Kentucky.

03:58.366 --> 03:59.366
As what?

03:59.432 --> 04:00.766
- As a clinical...
- As a--as a pharmacist?

04:00.834 --> 04:03.500
As a registered pharmacist
in the State of Kentucky,

04:03.567 --> 04:06.366
and as a registered pharmacist
and a consultant pharmacist

04:06.432 --> 04:07.432
in the State of Florida.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.332
And both licenses are current?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.834
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.432
And you had zero training?

04:13.500 --> 04:14.734
[Larisha] Yes, ma'am. Zero training.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.065
So what were you
going to contribute to this business?

04:17.132 --> 04:20.733
[Larisha] Nefertiti encouraged me
to get my life coach certificate,

04:20.800 --> 04:23.065
which I started to do online.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.733
I was supposed to do
the spiritual side of the coaching,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.966
and she was gonna do
the health side of the coaching.

04:28.033 --> 04:32.632
When we fell out in December of 2020,

04:32.699 --> 04:34.266
she was my health coach prior to that,

04:34.332 --> 04:36.667
but when we fell out, she went on a...

04:36.733 --> 04:37.733
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.667
- No, you're getting ahead of yourself.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:39.733 --> 04:44.165
At some point,
you acknowledged that you hired her...

04:44.233 --> 04:46.300
- Yes.
- ...for $600...

04:46.367 --> 04:48.300
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to be your health coach.

04:48.367 --> 04:51.533
- Yes.
- In what month and year did you do that?

04:51.600 --> 04:55.834
In November of 2020,
I hired her to be my health coach.

04:55.899 --> 04:59.332
Okay. And at that time,
what were your issues?

04:59.399 --> 05:02.466
I had pre-diabetes symptoms.

05:02.533 --> 05:05.233
My toes were tingling for months.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.233
And I had told her I don't know
why my toes are tingling.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.399
I don't know what's going on.

05:09.466 --> 05:12.600
About maybe two months
after my toe started tingling,

05:12.666 --> 05:15.600
I went to squeeze my toe
because it was in pain

05:15.666 --> 05:17.899
and pus oozed out of my toe.

05:17.966 --> 05:21.600
So I was having pre-diabetes symptoms,
I was very afraid.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.867
So I changed my diet,
got my food under control,

05:24.934 --> 05:29.300
stop consuming so much sugar
and my pre-diabetes symptoms went away.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.132
- My toes stopped tingling. And...
- Good.

05:31.199 --> 05:34.132
- That was before you hired her?
- Before I hired her, right.

05:34.199 --> 05:37.733
So, I hired her because I still wanted
to get my weight under control.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.100
I have two children.

05:39.165 --> 05:41.966
After the two of them were born,
I just continued to gain weight

05:42.033 --> 05:46.432
and the hormonal changes, I just was
having a hard time getting it down.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.800
So that's why I hired her to help me
lose the weight.

05:48.867 --> 05:51.933
[Judge Judy] Okay.
And it was a business arrangement.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.199
- You both acknowledge it was for $600.
- Yes.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.766
And the only discrepancy is that

05:57.834 --> 06:00.399
you say you paid her
$400 of the $600?

06:00.466 --> 06:01.600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

06:01.666 --> 06:05.233
Do you have proof that she says
you only paid 200, did she pay 200 or 400?

06:05.300 --> 06:08.834
She paid $150 and we bartered $50.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.000
We bartered $50.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.432
Larisha's contribution to me
if she would do like,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.800
um, flyers for me
because she was good at that. So...

06:14.867 --> 06:18.432
Okay, so what you're saying
is she in effect gave you $200?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.834
Right. And I have the proof
here, she--when she said

06:20.899 --> 06:24.533
that she was going to cash at me
the balance due in 400 on January 9th.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.567
I'd like to see it.
Did you say $400?

06:26.632 --> 06:28.966
Yes. She asked me how much
she said, how much I owe you.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.733
And I told her, and she said okay.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.033
Okay.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.500
- And then I also have...
- Shh. Shh.

06:38.567 --> 06:43.199
Okay, on the 24th of December,
Ms. Stone, she wrote to you,

06:43.266 --> 06:45.899
- "You owed $400. Total less."
- Yes, ma'am.

06:45.966 --> 06:49.199
- And you wrote back, "Okay."
- Yes, ma'am. Absolutely.

06:49.266 --> 06:51.466
I agreed to pay Nefertiti the $400.

06:51.533 --> 06:54.399
- Okay, so you agreed to give her $400?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

06:54.466 --> 06:56.100
- That was in December?
- Yes.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.332
- Okay. Did you give it to her?
- No, ma'am. I did not.

06:58.399 --> 07:01.466
- Why not?
- She breached our agreement.

07:01.533 --> 07:04.867
She stated in her intake paperwork,
that all of my information

07:04.934 --> 07:07.100
would remain confidential between us,

07:07.165 --> 07:10.300
that she wouldn't share anything
past our health coaching.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.899
She published pictures of me
to the internet.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.733
- I would like to submit...
- Just a second.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.800
- Yes, ma'am.
- On what date?

07:15.867 --> 07:18.533
I don't have the date
because I screenshot these in...

07:18.600 --> 07:20.899
Well, that's-- then it's useless to me.

07:20.966 --> 07:24.699
On December 24th of 2020,

07:24.766 --> 07:27.632
you said okay to her statement

07:27.699 --> 07:29.632
that you owe $400.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.934
- You've said okay.
- [Larisha] Mm-hmm.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.766
[Judge Judy] If there are things
that she posted afterwards,

07:32.834 --> 07:35.399
I'm gonna hear it
as part of your counterclaim.

07:35.466 --> 07:39.367
But so far, you haven't told me
why you didn't pay her.

07:39.432 --> 07:42.233
Okay. After I agreed to pay her the money,

07:42.300 --> 07:44.834
I told her that I would pay her
on January 9th

07:44.899 --> 07:48.567
and she remembers that I told her
that I would pay her on January 9th.

07:48.632 --> 07:51.632
Between December 24th and January 9th,

07:51.699 --> 07:54.165
she had released personal information.

07:54.233 --> 07:58.100
She broke the agreement
that we had in my intake paperwork,

07:58.165 --> 08:02.165
she published information
that she gathered on my intake paperwork

08:02.233 --> 08:03.834
to her social media pages.

08:03.899 --> 08:07.399
[Judge Judy] Okay. Ms. Abdullah,
the reason she is giving now,

08:07.466 --> 08:11.399
which is different from the reason
that you gave in your answer,

08:11.466 --> 08:15.300
the reason that you gave
in your answer for not paying her

08:15.367 --> 08:17.065
was that she didn't do anything.

08:17.132 --> 08:18.466
- I'm just telling you.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:18.533 --> 08:22.033
That that's the reason
that you gave in your answer.

08:22.100 --> 08:26.300
The last two weeks of the program sheet
provided no coaching at all.

08:26.367 --> 08:30.132
I got one email during week five
where everything

08:30.199 --> 08:32.265
was a repeat of the previous week.

08:32.332 --> 08:36.899
In week six, there was no contact
related to health coaching at all.

08:36.966 --> 08:38.533
I felt ripped off.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.500
That's what you say in your answer.

08:40.567 --> 08:44.466
Your answer has nothing to do
with breaching the agreement because

08:44.533 --> 08:47.033
she posted personal information,
Ms. Stone.

08:47.100 --> 08:51.332
The reason you gave in your answer
was that she didn't provide the service.

08:51.399 --> 08:52.500
[Larisha] Both are true, ma'am.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.200
Well, the one that you gave in your answer

08:55.265 --> 08:57.133
was that she didn't provide the service.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.066
Okay. So now you're telling me
that the reason

08:59.133 --> 09:02.600
that you didn't finish paying her
despite the fact that you said

09:02.667 --> 09:06.567
you were going to pay her,
is because she breached the agreement.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.600
- May I see a copy of the agreement?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:19.366 --> 09:22.866
Ms. Abdullah, the last line that Ms. Stone

09:22.933 --> 09:25.600
is referring to says that the information

09:25.667 --> 09:28.767
she's providing in this intake form,

09:28.833 --> 09:32.165
which I assume she did,
it talks about her health information,

09:32.232 --> 09:35.633
about her stressors,
what her hope is for the program that...

09:35.700 --> 09:37.033
[Nefertiti] Am I allowed to see that,
to see if it's really my intake form?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.799
Absolutely. Absolutely.

09:38.866 --> 09:40.133
Please?

09:45.700 --> 09:47.700
This form has been redone.

09:47.767 --> 09:48.767
[Larisha] Oh, wow.

09:48.834 --> 09:52.500
I don't have a Wellness Balance
logo on my form, as well as the font...

09:52.834 --> 09:54.265
Well, show me show me your intake--
show me your intake form.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.100
I don't-- I don't have my form.

09:56.165 --> 09:58.133
- Well, if that's...
- This is not my form.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.066
- It may be when you say it's...
- It is not signed.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.734
Well, it doesn't have to be signed.

10:02.799 --> 10:04.600
It does not have--signed by the client,

10:04.667 --> 10:07.265
what she has highlighted there

10:07.332 --> 10:10.734
would seem to be
normal course of business

10:10.799 --> 10:14.500
is any information that is furnished--
pay attention, Ms. Abdullah.

10:14.567 --> 10:15.667
Yes, ma'am.

10:15.734 --> 10:17.734
- That any information...
- This isn't mine.

10:17.799 --> 10:20.299
No. I don't believe that.
You may have updated it.

10:20.366 --> 10:24.567
But what it says at the bottom,
since you can't produce any other...

10:24.633 --> 10:26.232
- Yes, ma'am.
- ...any documentation

10:26.299 --> 10:28.432
is very clear, and it's very professional.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.166
And it says that the information

10:31.232 --> 10:34.633
that a prospective client fills out

10:34.700 --> 10:37.500
will only be shared
for statistical purposes,

10:37.567 --> 10:41.232
and will not be published
for any other reason,

10:41.299 --> 10:43.265
will not be used for any other reason.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.933
What Ms. Stone says is--

10:46.000 --> 10:49.500
and I don't give, quite frankly
a rat's behind whether or not

10:49.567 --> 10:54.165
it was done between December 24th
and January 9th--

10:54.232 --> 10:59.000
she says that someplace
you published information

10:59.066 --> 11:01.734
about her on the internet

11:01.799 --> 11:03.633
that you gleaned

11:03.700 --> 11:07.000
while you were involved in coaching her

11:07.066 --> 11:09.833
in health wellness coaching.

11:09.899 --> 11:12.066
And that is-- if it's true,

11:12.133 --> 11:14.799
and I haven't seen anything yet,
is most unprofessional.

11:17.066 --> 11:20.700
Posting this photograph with the caption,

11:20.767 --> 11:24.399
"Larisha Stone still owes me $400.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.933
I helped her lose at least one
of those chins."

11:28.000 --> 11:29.899
Did you write that?

11:29.966 --> 11:30.966
[announcer] Later.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.432
It's a lot of baloney!

11:32.500 --> 11:34.033
I've been in this business a long time.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.933
I know baloney,
I know when it's raining outside,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.667
or someone is peeing on my leg.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.866
Unfortunately, the government
doesn't seem to have that sense.

11:52.767 --> 11:57.200
[announcer] Nefertiti Abdullah
says her former friend, Larisha Stone,

11:57.265 --> 11:59.933
owes for the balance
of health coaching services.

12:00.066 --> 12:03.100
Larisha is countersuing
for breach of contract

12:03.166 --> 12:04.700
and invasion of privacy.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.066
Okay. I'd like to see what
you're alleging, maybe it's nothing.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.567
- [Nefertiti] Okay.
- [Larisha] Yes, ma'am.

12:09.633 --> 12:13.133
So the first thing I have is a photo
that she shared of me when she...

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
- Just a sec.
- ...asked me to...

12:14.265 --> 12:16.066
- Shh. Just a sec.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.366
Well, I have to tell you that posting

12:22.432 --> 12:25.966
this photograph of Ms. Stone,

12:26.033 --> 12:28.734
if you did it with the caption,

12:28.799 --> 12:31.533
"Larisha Stone of The 9 Minds

12:31.600 --> 12:34.000
still owes me $400.

12:34.066 --> 12:37.466
I'm taking her to small claims court
in North Carolina.

12:37.533 --> 12:38.966
Someone let her know.

12:39.033 --> 12:42.432
I helped her lose
at least one of those chins."

12:42.500 --> 12:43.734
Did you write that?

12:43.799 --> 12:46.133
I did after this was posted about me.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.866
Okay. I'd like to take
a look at it, please.

12:51.734 --> 12:54.265
[Nefertiti] There you go.
And she can read that as well.

12:56.432 --> 12:57.834
You're giving me a whole...

12:57.899 --> 13:00.366
She posted a lot,
along with a lot of other women

13:00.432 --> 13:01.432
in a group about me.

13:03.232 --> 13:04.533
These are conversations.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.332
That's a whole different ball of wax.

13:06.399 --> 13:08.500
We should--give this back to her, please.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.066
This, I have to tell you.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.866
This is unprofessional.

13:12.933 --> 13:17.500
And if you're dealing with somebody
that you think is not wrapped tight,

13:17.567 --> 13:20.265
that's not what you do
as a professional lady

13:20.332 --> 13:22.633
who's licensed
in two different states.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.133
Just unprofessional.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.232
Not actionable, but unprofessional.

13:26.299 --> 13:28.033
You owe her $400.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.399
Judgment for the plaintiff.

13:29.466 --> 13:30.833
Your counterclaim's dismissed.

13:30.899 --> 13:32.133
We're finished. Thank you.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.466
[Kevin]
Court is adjourned.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.066
Nefertiti got what she wanted.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.299
And I got what I wanted.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.432
Hopefully I can be done with her
for the rest of my life.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.232
I am happy with the outcome.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.734
The spiritual community
is just like any other.

13:44.799 --> 13:46.734
We have issues just like everybody else.

13:46.799 --> 13:48.299
And that's how we ended
up here today

13:48.366 --> 13:50.366
is me speaking vocally

13:50.432 --> 13:54.567
about the con game that was
going on in that community.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.165
Everyone has moved on
except for Nefertiti, so.

13:57.232 --> 13:58.734
I'm just happy to move on as well.

13:58.799 --> 14:02.200
I've gone my separate way
despite what Ms. Stone has presented.

14:02.265 --> 14:03.899
I just wanted to come back
and get what was mine,

14:03.966 --> 14:04.966
which was my money.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.399
[Sarah] I just think
it was actually pretty despicable

14:08.466 --> 14:11.667
that a professional of any kind,
let alone a doctor,

14:11.734 --> 14:15.332
would post those sorts of photos
that a client gave them

14:15.399 --> 14:18.933
in confidence trying to better
themselves trying to lose weight,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.767
do better for her kids,
like the defendant was explaining.

14:21.833 --> 14:24.799
I just--I can't imagine
that and like you said,

14:24.866 --> 14:26.466
it's wrong, but is it actionable?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.767
I don't think it's actionable.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.265
I think that they got into--
because of the money owed,

14:31.332 --> 14:33.200
they got into a catfight.

14:33.265 --> 14:36.232
Clearly from the text messages
she was owed,

14:36.299 --> 14:39.165
and the defendant acknowledged
that she owed her $400,

14:39.232 --> 14:43.700
is that I think that it was unprofessional
to post anything, I actually do.

14:43.767 --> 14:46.533
But this wasn't a strictly
professional relationship.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.200
These two women knew
too much about each other.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.866
So, unfortunate.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.399
Case 1055, Bryant versus Holmes.

14:54.466 --> 14:56.332
All parties, please step forward.

14:56.399 --> 15:00.133
[announcer] Lashanda Bryant
is suing her 22-year-old daughter,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.466
Jasmine Holmes,
for an unpaid school loan.

15:03.533 --> 15:06.767
Ms. Bryant, the defendant
is your daughter, and it is your claim

15:06.833 --> 15:08.799
that she owes the balance
of a loan for school.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.866
Yes.

15:09.933 --> 15:12.567
So I'm gonna start with you, Ms. Holmes.
How old are you?

15:12.633 --> 15:13.633
I'm 22 years old.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.966
And I gather from your answer

15:16.033 --> 15:19.600
that your parents
were separated or divorced.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.133
And you lived with your father.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.899
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Until you were how old?

15:23.966 --> 15:24.966
Twenty-two.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.100
When did you start to live
just with your father, how old were you?

15:28.166 --> 15:31.332
I was about 13, 14.

15:31.399 --> 15:33.466
So you lived with him for almost a decade?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.466
- Yes, ma'am.
- Were you in touch with your mother?

15:35.533 --> 15:38.200
It was on and off for three years.

15:38.265 --> 15:40.700
Okay. So you were
on and off with your mom?

15:40.767 --> 15:42.165
- Yes, Your Honor.
- But then there came a time

15:42.232 --> 15:45.834
when you had some sort
of kerfuffle with your father.

15:45.899 --> 15:47.232
- Yes, Your Honor.
- When was that?

15:47.299 --> 15:51.533
That was March 16th,
the cusp of midnight.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.700
- March 16th of this year?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:53.767 --> 15:56.066
You called your mom and asked
if you could stay with her for a while?

15:56.133 --> 15:57.133
Yes, Your Honor.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.366
- And that was on the 16th of March?
- Yes, Your Honor.

15:59.432 --> 16:01.299
What school were you going to then?

16:01.366 --> 16:02.966
I was not in school at the time.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.700
- What were you doing?
- I was working.

16:04.767 --> 16:08.667
I was at Sally Beauty Holdings
for about a year and-- a year and a month.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.000
What kind of work was that?

16:10.066 --> 16:11.734
It was retail customer service.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.799
And you were
a customer service person?

16:13.866 --> 16:14.866
Yes, ma'am.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.000
And that was
until you left your father's house?

16:17.066 --> 16:20.366
Yes, ma'am.
I left April 3rd, 2021.

16:20.432 --> 16:22.866
Prior to working there,
were you in school?

16:22.933 --> 16:24.466
- Yes, ma'am.
- What school?

16:24.533 --> 16:28.432
I was at, um, from 2017 to 2019,

16:28.500 --> 16:30.899
I was at Xavier University of Louisiana.

16:30.966 --> 16:34.834
And then I transferred to Georgia State
University in that fall, 2019.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.834
- Were you a full-time student?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:36.899 --> 16:38.033
Did you graduate from there?

16:38.100 --> 16:39.100
No, ma'am. I did not.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.100
In what year did you stop
going to school?

16:41.165 --> 16:45.100
I stopped going to school 2019,
after my fall semester,

16:45.165 --> 16:46.667
because of financial reasons.

16:46.734 --> 16:48.165
And is that when you went to work?

16:48.232 --> 16:49.734
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

16:49.799 --> 16:52.232
When you moved in with your mother,
according to what I read,

16:52.299 --> 16:54.466
your mother wanted you to get back
into school and you wanted

16:54.533 --> 16:55.600
to get back into school?

16:55.667 --> 16:56.667
Yes, Your Honor.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.000
But you owed the school some money.

16:58.066 --> 17:01.000
Yes, ma'am.
For my transcripts, I had hold.

17:01.066 --> 17:02.734
And I owed a balance of...

17:02.799 --> 17:04.467
You owed a $5,000 balance?

17:04.532 --> 17:05.532
Yes, ma'am.

17:05.599 --> 17:09.432
And according to what I read,
you said you would save up about $1,200.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.500
Yes, Your Honor.

17:10.567 --> 17:12.799
And then it becomes sort of dicey.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.900
Your mother says
that she paid the tuition.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.633
And there were certain conditions
that you stay in school.

17:18.700 --> 17:23.467
She's claiming that the balance
that's owed to her is $3,800.

17:23.532 --> 17:25.099
- Is that right?
- Yes.

17:25.165 --> 17:28.900
Your mother says
that one of the problems is,

17:28.967 --> 17:31.933
that somehow you got a check

17:32.000 --> 17:35.133
from the government for about $20,000.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.900
- Yes, Your Honor.
- For what?

17:36.967 --> 17:39.266
I run a small business on Etsy.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.900
It's called Crystallizzed Co.

17:40.967 --> 17:44.066
I sell crystals, gemstones, and minerals.

17:44.133 --> 17:47.866
Okay. So we didn't discuss
that when I asked you what you did.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.532
What you said was that you worked

17:50.599 --> 17:52.799
for this company for a year and a half,

17:52.866 --> 17:54.500
and that you were going to school.

17:54.567 --> 17:58.200
Now I want you to tell me
what kind of program you applied

17:58.266 --> 18:01.165
for that got you $20,000.

18:01.232 --> 18:02.366
- I did the P...
- We're gonna go--

18:02.432 --> 18:04.266
we're gonna go through it very carefully.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.467
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:05.532 --> 18:06.567
What program?

18:06.633 --> 18:10.165
I did the PPP loan
for small business for the 2021.

18:10.232 --> 18:13.467
That's payroll protection
so that you could pay employees.

18:13.532 --> 18:14.532
Yes.

18:14.599 --> 18:17.799
How many employees
and what are their names?

18:17.866 --> 18:20.500
I have two, it's me.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.532
- I have my boyfriend.
- No, that's you.

18:22.599 --> 18:24.633
- Okay.
- That's you, you have you.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.333
And you have your boyfriend?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.532
Yes. His name is...

18:27.599 --> 18:29.266
Just a second.
Who else?

18:29.333 --> 18:31.432
And then I would have my...

18:31.500 --> 18:34.165
Slowly make sure
'cause I'm gonna check on all this.

18:34.232 --> 18:36.333
- Okay.
- Go ahead. You and your boyfriend.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.633
I would just say me and him, then.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.200
Just us two.

18:41.165 --> 18:43.133
So you applied for employees?

18:43.200 --> 18:47.232
How many employees did you tell
the United States government

18:47.299 --> 18:50.232
that you employed
that you needed protection for?

18:50.299 --> 18:51.866
- Two.
- And you named them?

18:51.933 --> 18:54.366
- Do you have a copy of that application?
- No, ma'am, I do not.

18:54.432 --> 18:58.733
And so they sent you $20,000
for you and your boyfriend?

18:58.799 --> 19:01.000
- What's his name, by the way?
- William.

19:01.066 --> 19:03.767
- Does he go to school?
- He has graduated already.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.099
- What kind of work does he do?
- He worked for Aflac.

19:06.165 --> 19:07.532
- An insurance company?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:07.599 --> 19:08.799
Until when?

19:08.866 --> 19:13.500
Until recently around-- was it August--
I'm wanna say the 18th,

19:13.567 --> 19:15.767
he resigned of this year.

19:15.834 --> 19:16.834
- You mean just now?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.733
On what date did you get
this $20,000?

19:19.799 --> 19:24.099
I received it June 4th, I believe.

19:24.165 --> 19:26.099
- Did you put it in a bank?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.366
- In whose name is the bank account?
- Mine.

19:28.432 --> 19:30.500
- Personal?
- Yes. Checking.

19:30.567 --> 19:33.900
Do you have a company,
an incorporated company anywhere?

19:33.967 --> 19:35.432
- No, ma'am.
- When you applied

19:35.500 --> 19:38.299
for this payroll protection program
from the government,

19:38.366 --> 19:39.866
did you say you had a company?

19:39.933 --> 19:40.933
Yes, I did.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.866
And what was the name of the
company that you say that you had?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.000
Crystallized Co.

19:45.066 --> 19:47.232
Crystallized Co,
C-O is company?

19:47.299 --> 19:48.767
- Yes. Company, yes.
- Company?

19:48.834 --> 19:50.099
- Yes.
- Well, don't you know

19:50.165 --> 19:52.967
that you have to have an--
a company incorporated?

19:53.032 --> 19:56.165
You need to pay certain fees to the state.

19:56.232 --> 19:58.333
You didn't do any of that.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.733
Oh, you got to--

20:01.599 --> 20:05.000
are you getting the clue
that what you did was perpetrating

20:05.066 --> 20:07.567
a fraud getting money from the government

20:07.633 --> 20:09.232
for a fake company?

20:09.299 --> 20:13.299
It's not designed
for a girl and her boyfriend.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.567
[announcer] Lashanda Bryant
says her 22-year-old daughter,

20:26.633 --> 20:29.834
Jasmine Holmes,
owes for the cost of school.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.767
Jasmine is countersuing
for emotional distress

20:32.834 --> 20:34.467
and the loss of her belongings.

20:34.532 --> 20:37.432
Okay.
Ms. Holmes, are you realizing now

20:37.500 --> 20:40.165
that what you did was fraudulent?

20:40.232 --> 20:42.767
Are you getting the clue
that what you did

20:42.834 --> 20:46.432
was perpetrating a fraud
getting money from the government

20:46.500 --> 20:49.532
for a fake company that didn't exist

20:49.599 --> 20:51.232
with you and your boyfriend

20:51.299 --> 20:55.000
who never filed a tax return
for Crystal Co,

20:55.066 --> 20:57.834
never filed to incorporate Crystal Co.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.200
The IRS just wrote
you a check for $20,000.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.366
Don't you realize that...

21:02.432 --> 21:03.432
No. No, Your Honor.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.834
I was under the impression that the PPP
loan was to help small businesses.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.733
- You don't have a small business!
- Yes, I do.

21:09.799 --> 21:12.866
No! You don't have a small business
unless it's a company.

21:12.933 --> 21:14.666
- Madam, and you and your boyfriend...
- It's not registered...

21:14.733 --> 21:16.467
- ...are not a small company...
- ...LCC...

21:16.532 --> 21:18.967
...because he worked
for Aflac until August 18th.

21:19.032 --> 21:20.467
I do have a small business,
it's just not incorporated.

21:20.532 --> 21:22.200
And so it's not designed--
listen to me.

21:22.266 --> 21:26.266
It's not designed for a girl
and her boyfriend.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.200
It's designed for people
who have a business,

21:29.266 --> 21:33.532
a legitimate business in which
they have employees who pay taxes,

21:33.599 --> 21:35.866
and it was designed for the pandemic

21:35.933 --> 21:39.099
so that companies
that were laying off employees

21:39.165 --> 21:42.032
could continue to pay them their wages.

21:42.099 --> 21:43.432
Don't you understand that?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.032
It's a lot of baloney.

21:45.099 --> 21:46.099
Okay.

21:46.165 --> 21:47.165
I've been in this business a long time.

21:47.232 --> 21:49.900
I know baloney,
I know when it's raining outside,

21:49.967 --> 21:51.799
or someone is peeing on my leg.

21:52.799 --> 21:56.000
Unfortunately, the government
doesn't seem to have that sense.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.532
Your mother paid off your school loan.

21:57.599 --> 21:58.834
Are you going to school?

21:58.900 --> 22:00.200
Yes, ma'am. I am fully enrolled.

22:00.266 --> 22:02.400
I'm a full-time student.
I have 15 credits.

22:02.467 --> 22:03.666
- Now.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:03.733 --> 22:05.567
- Is she?
- I don't know. I don't...

22:05.633 --> 22:06.900
- I have evidence that I am.
- ...talk to her.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.232
Just a second.

22:08.299 --> 22:10.467
She decided she didn't
wanna talk with me anymore.

22:10.532 --> 22:11.532
I'd like--

22:11.599 --> 22:14.500
I would like to see that she's
enrolled as a full-time student.

22:24.599 --> 22:26.400
When did you start to take classes?

22:26.467 --> 22:28.133
August 16th, 2021.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.000
Did you take out any student loans?

22:30.066 --> 22:33.666
No, ma'am. I did--
I did my application to FAFSA.

22:33.733 --> 22:35.967
Unfortunately, it was rejected,
but I do have money

22:36.032 --> 22:38.232
saved to pay for my college.

22:38.299 --> 22:40.900
Is that from the PPP program?

22:40.967 --> 22:43.266
That is for saving--
from savings that I saved from...

22:43.333 --> 22:45.633
- But--
- ...my two jobs that I have to now.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
Where are you living?

22:46.767 --> 22:49.000
I live with my sister in Atlanta, Georgia.

22:49.066 --> 22:51.432
- And where does the boyfriend live?
- He lives in Florida.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.900
Did you tell your daughter you would
cover her tuition if she were in school?

22:54.967 --> 22:56.900
What she owed in order
to get back into school?

22:56.967 --> 22:57.967
Yeah.

22:58.032 --> 22:59.366
- You told her that?
- Mm-hmm.

22:59.432 --> 23:01.400
She's in school. She's in school.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.599
- Well...
- You were annoyed

23:02.666 --> 23:05.500
that she got all this money
and didn't pay her own tuition.

23:05.567 --> 23:06.933
- Well, she...
- But that's what happened.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.165
I mean, I assume 'cause you wrote
about it in your complaint.

23:10.232 --> 23:13.032
So, I mean, I, I couldn't guess
at something like this--

23:13.099 --> 23:16.432
you wrote about it in your complaint,
so I assume when she got this check

23:16.500 --> 23:19.532
for $20,000 and didn't give you
back the money

23:19.599 --> 23:21.599
that you had given her,
that you were annoyed.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.400
I was, but when she came back

23:23.467 --> 23:26.633
from her boyfriend visit,

23:26.700 --> 23:29.467
I picked her up from the station
and she had an attitude.

23:29.532 --> 23:30.532
Just a second.

23:30.599 --> 23:34.467
Was this before
or after she got the money in June?

23:34.532 --> 23:37.333
- It was before.
- That's not accurate at all.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.500
- Just a second.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.733
When she went to visit with her boyfriend,

23:40.799 --> 23:44.032
had she already received
the $20,000 check?

23:44.099 --> 23:45.633
- No.
- No. Is that correct?

23:45.700 --> 23:46.700
Yes, ma'am.

23:46.767 --> 23:49.299
When she came back,
you said she had attitude.

23:49.366 --> 23:52.633
You had an argument.
What month was that, in June?

23:52.700 --> 23:54.066
- It was June.
- June what?

23:54.133 --> 23:57.232
June 3rd through the 6th,
I went on a small vacation

23:57.299 --> 23:58.799
to visit my boyfriend in Florida.

23:58.866 --> 24:02.299
Okay. And what date did you
move out of your mother's house?

24:02.366 --> 24:04.866
June 7th, when I got back,
that was the--

24:05.900 --> 24:08.500
after the day of the dispute
I had with my mother in the car.

24:08.567 --> 24:11.000
And on what date
did you receive this check?

24:11.066 --> 24:14.032
June 4th.
I was already on the trip and...

24:14.099 --> 24:15.567
So the money
went right into your bank?

24:15.633 --> 24:16.633
Yes, ma'am.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.299
Did you tell your mother about it?

24:18.366 --> 24:20.099
My sister told her before I could.

24:20.165 --> 24:22.767
And my mother text me like,
"Are you not going to give me my money?"

24:22.834 --> 24:25.099
And I said, "I will send it to you now,"

24:25.165 --> 24:28.232
because the original agreement
for my tuition, she asked me if,

24:28.299 --> 24:31.099
if I had anything to contribute
from the job that I was working

24:31.165 --> 24:32.366
at Sally's, I said I could...

24:32.432 --> 24:34.066
Well, what happened--
what happened was,

24:34.133 --> 24:37.400
they wouldn't send your transcripts
to the new school unless you paid off

24:37.467 --> 24:39.333
the $5,000 that you owed the old school.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.400
Yes, Your Honor.

24:40.467 --> 24:41.532
So you had to pay that back.

24:41.599 --> 24:44.165
You had $1,200,
your mother paid the other 3,800.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.232
Yes, ma'am.

24:45.299 --> 24:47.133
Okay. And that happened before.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.032
And then your sister,
with whom you confided that you had

24:51.099 --> 24:52.933
gotten this windfall from the government,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.032
shared that information with your mother.

24:54.099 --> 24:55.400
Yes, Your Honor.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.500
And then when your mother
picked you up from the airport,

24:57.567 --> 25:00.599
she said to you,
I assume you argued about this money.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.432
No, actually--no, Your Honor.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.500
So the 6th that I got back,

25:05.567 --> 25:07.700
it was 4:15 in, in the morning.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.165
My mother was complaining
that I wasn't doing my job or being--

25:11.232 --> 25:12.834
doing enough for my school.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.967
She was saying that I didn't apply myself.

25:16.032 --> 25:19.834
She was saying that I didn't take
the necessary steps to get accepted

25:19.900 --> 25:21.467
into Fort Valley University.

25:21.532 --> 25:24.967
And I told her that everything that I did
over my break with my boyfriend

25:25.032 --> 25:26.400
that I had handled the situation.

25:26.467 --> 25:29.099
That June 7th, she sent me a text.

25:29.165 --> 25:31.099
Here's the text right here
if you would like to see the evidence.

25:31.165 --> 25:32.232
Sure.

25:32.299 --> 25:33.733
- [Kevin] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- [Judge Judy] Sure.

25:35.532 --> 25:39.366
She sent me a text saying
what's on that paper right there.

25:39.432 --> 25:44.032
And I replied with what's
actually right there, is what--

25:44.099 --> 25:45.900
You can give me
my phone and--yeah.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.165
I believe that you said
that you would pay this tuition,

25:48.232 --> 25:50.834
this $3,800 for her if she was in school.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.567
She's in school,
so you don't get your $3,800 back.

25:53.633 --> 25:56.165
You're counterclaiming,
which is ridiculous.

25:56.232 --> 25:59.733
You say you--
your mother wasn't a good mother

25:59.799 --> 26:01.666
and she was emotionally abusive.

26:01.733 --> 26:02.733
Yes, Your Honor.

26:02.799 --> 26:05.066
Yeah. Well, some mothers
are less perfect than others.

26:05.133 --> 26:06.133
Yes, Your Honor.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.834
The case is dismissed, madam.
So is your counterclaim.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.900
We're finished here.

26:08.967 --> 26:09.967
[Kevin]
Court is adjourned.

26:11.032 --> 26:12.767
I'm glad that she's actually in school.

26:12.834 --> 26:14.133
I'm definitely gonna graduate.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.767
There's no ifs or maybes or buts.
I'm definitely graduating.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.633
We have a love-hate relationship.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.633
She started--stopped talking to me
in February of 2017.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.232
Like Judge Judy said, that,
that some mothers aren't fit.

26:24.299 --> 26:25.299
I believe she's one of them.

26:25.366 --> 26:29.500
I hope she graduates and,
and have a, a, a future of, you know,

26:29.567 --> 26:31.733
maybe we probably can talk, but, hey.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.165
I don't necessarily have
any hard feelings against my mother,

26:34.232 --> 26:38.700
just know that she hurt me
and that I'm, I'm open to anything.

26:38.767 --> 26:41.767
Sarah, if my recollection is correct,
this is the...

26:41.900 --> 26:44.266
either the-- second
or the third case that we've done

26:44.333 --> 26:47.467
that involved abuse
of the payroll protection program.

26:47.532 --> 26:50.900
It always strikes me that
if people spent as much time

26:50.967 --> 26:53.133
working towards a positive,

26:53.200 --> 26:55.366
productive goal,

26:55.432 --> 26:58.599
as they spent in trying
to circumvent the rules,

26:58.666 --> 27:01.834
that they would have
much more satisfying lives.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.467
And this country probably wouldn't be

27:04.532 --> 27:06.266
in the kind of debt circumstance it's in.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.666
Anyway, I think that
the whole thing is terrible.

27:08.733 --> 27:09.733
- Yeah.
- I don't--

27:09.799 --> 27:10.799
- Especially--
- I don't know what to say.

27:10.866 --> 27:13.299
Especially being
from New York City and seeing

27:13.366 --> 27:16.432
a lot of small businesses, restaurants,
places I used to frequent a lot

27:17.266 --> 27:20.834
with good employees,
hardworking people that have applied

27:20.900 --> 27:24.767
and qualify for these types of loans,
and then to see some of the people

27:24.834 --> 27:28.165
come through here like we've seen,
just abusing the system

27:28.232 --> 27:31.400
and taking those opportunities
and that money from people

27:31.467 --> 27:33.232
- that could really benefit...
- Who would benefit from it.

27:33.299 --> 27:34.599
- So... it's unfortunate.
- True.
