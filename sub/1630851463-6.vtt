WEBVTT

00:09.551 --> 00:11.803
You'll be splitting
into three teams

00:11.845 --> 00:14.931
highlighting
sustainable seafood.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.391
- Blue Team.
- Cook!

00:16.433 --> 00:18.601
I love our team,
it's so happy and helpful.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.146
Can you hold this? Hold it!

00:22.105 --> 00:24.190
Oh, my goodness, look at that.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.400
That's gorgeous.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.818
Don't forget the lemon.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.737
I really love that
mustard chutney

00:28.778 --> 00:30.155
I added some wine.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.906
We didn't want wine.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.367
I'm going to put cream
and corn starch in.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.911
I never saw this dish coming
from Anika and Anu.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.288
Pretty near perfect, I think.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.875
The winning chefs are
Anika and Anu.

00:43.668 --> 00:48.256
We were all blown away
how well each one of you did.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.425
You made this incredibly
difficult for us.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.677
No one will be going
home tonight

00:57.140 --> 00:58.183
Nine duos remain...

00:58.224 --> 00:59.809
I can't reach!

00:59.851 --> 01:01.686
Voila!

01:02.312 --> 01:05.315
At stake? $50,000

01:05.357 --> 01:06.816
and the chance to be crowned

01:06.858 --> 01:09.235
the champions of
Top Chef Family Style.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.458
It is so nice to see

01:23.500 --> 01:26.503
that the tree has not grown
any more leaves.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.546
Anika and Anu,
do you feel that way?

01:28.588 --> 01:31.591
I mean, I'm happy that no one
went home this time.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.719
It feels great to finally
win an elimination.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.971
This is really going to give me
that boost of confidence.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.724
We always know that she has
this passion in her,

01:39.766 --> 01:42.477
and it's a validation
from everybody else

01:42.519 --> 01:44.062
that she is good.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.982
It's a lot of work to come
up with ideas on the fly.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.818
It is nerve wracking.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.404
I think it's exciting kind of
when it's over, like I did it,

01:52.445 --> 01:54.489
it wasn't as bad as I thought.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.157
But in that moment you're
kind of like,

01:56.199 --> 01:57.992
"Oh my gosh,
am I going to do it?"

01:58.034 --> 02:00.495
I love that I get to be here to
support Kennedy's passion.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.831
And as a mom, that's
what I want to do.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.874
I want to support my kids
and their dreams.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.002
I have five kids at home.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.462
I feel like I've given up
time with my other kids

02:09.504 --> 02:11.840
and my husband, and my
grandbaby, and my job.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.259
As much as, you know, sometimes
we butt heads.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.510
We've learned a lot about
each other

02:15.552 --> 02:17.512
and I think we've grown closer.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.806
So this whole experience
has made it worth it.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.982
- Oh, my God...
- Good morning chefs.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.275
Hello.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.694
Wow, look at all these homes.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.363
Welcome to the neighborhood.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.699
It's a little different,

02:37.741 --> 02:39.743
I see the street sign
with State Farm on it.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.828
I don't know what's going on.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.164
I'm waiting for Jake to come
out of the back or something.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.583
I should have wore
my khakis today.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.085
Please meet your guest judge
for this week's Quickfire.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.172
Award winning chef and member
of our Top Cheffamily,

02:52.213 --> 02:54.549
Nyesha Arrington.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.676
Chefs, as you can see,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.888
Top Chef Family Style
has its own ZIP Code now.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.725
Each one of your teams will get
one of these tiny houses

03:03.767 --> 03:06.061
Danny, you think you'll fit
through that door?

03:06.102 --> 03:07.812
You're so tall.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.481
I know, it's Delilah sized.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.359
It's Delilah sized, for sure.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.656
For this Quickfire challenge,

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
you'll have one hour
to create a dish

03:20.700 --> 03:22.577
that tells the story
of the neighborhood

03:22.619 --> 03:24.371
that you grew up in.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.540
Everything you need for the
challenge is inside your home.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.001
Your pantries are stocked
with ingredients,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.795
equipment, and cookware.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.631
- But there's a twist.
- Of course.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.801
None of your houses
have the same items.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.929
Our friends at State Farm
believe in being

03:40.970 --> 03:44.391
a good neighbor. So in order
to make the best dish possible,

03:44.432 --> 03:46.643
you'll have to depend
on each other.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.103
If you don't have something
you need,

03:48.144 --> 03:50.730
you'll have to borrow it
from your neighbor.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.482
Jenn why are you freaked out?

03:52.524 --> 03:54.192
Aren't you friends
with your neighbors,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.069
We're very loud neighbors.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.571
Okay well, today we're going to
learn how to be good neighbors.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.074
The kids are going to be the
ones doing the shopping.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.451
The winner
of this Quickfire challenge

04:03.493 --> 04:05.078
will receive immunity.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.498
And $10,000.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.130
I didn't win
the last 10K challenge,

04:15.171 --> 04:17.632
so I'm definitely hoping
that I can win this one

04:17.674 --> 04:20.969
just so that can put me closer
to buy my food truck.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.680
Chefs, we want your dishes
to tell us a story.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.432
Take us back to your
neighborhood

04:25.473 --> 04:28.018
and show us where
you come from.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.478
Okay, chefs, you can now
come up and grab

04:30.520 --> 04:32.856
the key to your new home.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.942
- Got six.
- Got five.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.361
- Number one.
- And number eight.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.531
"And number eight."
Are you ready?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.116
- Yeah.
- Yes.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.452
Because your time starts...

04:45.493 --> 04:46.995
Now.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.371
Ocean, move.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.040
Bye guys.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.250
All right, let's see
what's in our house, Delilah

04:52.292 --> 04:53.752
- AP flour.
- Chicken stock.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.378
What do we got, what do we got?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.881
We've got some tomatoes.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.050
Oh, we have mayonnaise,
awesome. This, this--

05:00.091 --> 05:03.178
So we should try to make the
remoulade like from scratch.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.722
I have the perfect idea okay,
chili dog. That is literally

05:05.764 --> 05:07.474
the first thing that
pops into my head

05:07.515 --> 05:09.184
because that's where we're from.

05:09.225 --> 05:12.729
Oh look, corn tortillas.
We can do a tostada.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.360
- But we need some meat.
- Okay, let me ask.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.780
Do you have either mangoes,
game meat, or burger buns?

05:21.821 --> 05:26.284
That's all
I got right there.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.078
I want to make birria tacos too.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.537
We only have shrimp.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.039
- Okay, go ask a neighbor.
- For what?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.041
Oh, whatever we need.
We want to make a taco

05:33.083 --> 05:35.543
because that just speaks
our hometown.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.087
Go, Dela, hurry, the time--

05:37.128 --> 05:40.090
We need baking
powder and hash chili.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.509
Excuse me, are you guys
using the masa?

05:42.550 --> 05:44.427
- The who?
- What the heck is that?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.054
Why don't you go look.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.390
- Do you have ground meat?
- I have ground meat,

05:48.431 --> 05:49.891
but I am looking
for, look.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.434
Can I please take that?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.811
- What is that?
- This is turkey.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.312
That's not what I need.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.064
Okay, I need dry chilies,
or beef chuck, or--

05:56.106 --> 05:58.066
- Do you have shrimp?
- I do have shrimp,

05:58.108 --> 05:59.984
but I might need it.
I might need it, though.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.945
- You got beans?
- I don't think so.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.947
Yes. Yes. I found it.
I found it.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.159
Peppers and onions.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.370
Because that's popular
in our town.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.122
You can have that, you're good.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.332
I got it. I got it.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.334
You've got to go
find pizza dough.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.464
- What do you need? No.
- Like game meat?

06:21.506 --> 06:23.091
You wanna get this rice cooking?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.843
I'm going to go shop around
for the beef.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.970
We immediately settle
on a loco moco

06:27.012 --> 06:29.597
because it is a Hawaiian dish

06:29.639 --> 06:31.433
that all locals
know how to make.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.768
- What are you looking for?
- We're looking for ground beef.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.353
I do not have ground beef.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.105
I know what I got to get it,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.774
but I'm hesitant because I don't
like asking people for things.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.818
You got ground beef?
You guys got extra ground beef.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.986
No.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.779
Jenn, you guys
got any ground beef.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.281
Ground beef? Who needs it?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.907
I need the ground beef.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.826
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.454
I've got some elk.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.622
That is it, thank you.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
Potatoes, we can do
loaded fries too.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.546
- We can do chili cheese fries.
- Oh, my God.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.048
I feel like I'm at home already.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.799
I know it takes me
right back home.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.259
Half my life is now in Houston.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.219
But the first half of my
life was in Detroit

07:08.261 --> 07:11.222
and we ate Coney Island
hot dogs after school

07:11.264 --> 07:12.640
when he picked me up.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.850
May I please
have these hot dogs?

07:13.892 --> 07:15.560
Do you guys have garlic?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.645
Fine, you can have the hotdogs.
I need garlic, though,

07:17.687 --> 07:19.314
- Who has garlic.
- Danny!

07:19.356 --> 07:21.107
Garlic over here!

07:23.485 --> 07:25.612
Whenever we had people over,

07:25.653 --> 07:27.238
my dad and I always
grill burgers,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.240
but this is a little
bit interesting

07:29.282 --> 07:31.576
because we don't have half
ingredients we normally use.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.036
Back home,
when we make burgers,

07:33.078 --> 07:35.455
we always use moose meat,
but elk meat

07:35.497 --> 07:37.707
is the only game meat they have.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.627
When we flip them,
I'm going to oil it again.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.337
Never used elk.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.632
They cook very similar,
but not so much as flavorful.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.468
So you grew up in Gallup,
New Mexico, right?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.178
With all the Navajo Nation?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.305
Yeah. And Navajo tacos
were very common.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.392
I grew up in New Mexico.
It's actually a little town

07:55.433 --> 07:58.019
that's on the Arizona border
surrounded by reservations,

07:58.061 --> 08:00.522
and we even have Native
American blood in us as well.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.107
So I thought it would just

08:02.148 --> 08:04.234
be a fun way to honor our
Native American neighbors.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.195
It's gonna be a
little spicy, all right.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.617
What are you making, Milan?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.536
We're making a coconut curry.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.872
Oh, we're doing ground turkey
burger inspired by a café

08:17.914 --> 08:20.083
that I used to go to
after school.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.544
And we're putting our
own Indian flair to it

08:22.585 --> 08:24.212
because my mom's from India.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.880
It's important to reflect
my mom's neighborhood

08:25.922 --> 08:27.340
in my dish because
her neighborhood

08:27.382 --> 08:28.717
is just as important as mine is.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.844
Were you guys given
pizza dough?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.637
Yeah, I have pizza dough.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.347
- Ooh, can we have it?
- Yeah.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.725
Can you make sure you can
get the cheese back?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.810
The cheese, yes
totally, totally.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.812
I'm going to take
a handful of this

08:40.854 --> 08:42.689
and I'm going to give back
to Anika and Anu

08:42.731 --> 08:44.858
- because it was theirs.
- We need all of it.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.569
It's theirs though.
Be a good neighbor, mom.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.571
Okay, I'm being a good neighbor.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.410
What else should
I put in this?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.203
I think that's good.
Just keep it simple.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.496
All right.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.749
I'm going to hot line
and put the dogs on.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.417
I'm going to boil
them first in a little bit

09:02.459 --> 09:04.586
of that chicken broth
for some additional

09:04.627 --> 09:05.879
- richness and flavor.
- Okay.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.422
And then I'ma grill them off.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.132
I'm not talking
about Coney Island, New York.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.925
In the city of Detroit,
the signature dish

09:10.967 --> 09:12.635
is a Coney Island hot dog.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.220
You got an amazing
grilled hot dog.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.598
You got bean-less chili,
mustard, and onions.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.851
Simple as that. We're keeping
it straight Detroit.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.936
28 minutes.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.023
Liz, what are you guys making?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.317
We are making a po'boy,

09:27.359 --> 09:29.444
which is like
the classic sandwich

09:29.486 --> 09:31.112
of our neighborhood
in New Orleans.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.447
Nice.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.657
Where we're from
there's a lot of street vendors

09:34.699 --> 09:36.368
always selling tacos
on the weekends.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.497
Normally all our meat
is tenderizing over hours.

09:40.538 --> 09:44.042
So, we need to get the beef
in the pressure cooker.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.753
That will speed up
the process.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.296
It is on right?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.799
I don't know. I've never
used a pressure cooker.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.759
I've never used a pressure
cooker either.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.886
But we're going to
assume it's on low.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.888
If that doesn't cook,
we're screwed.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.558
This pizza dough
is so annoying.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.185
Make it smaller.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.645
It's not rolling!

10:03.687 --> 10:05.605
This pizza dough is not good.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.817
The dough keeps on springing
back and the thicker

10:08.858 --> 10:11.403
the dough is, the harder
it is going to be to cook

10:11.444 --> 10:13.488
all the way through.
I need to start

10:13.530 --> 10:15.156
assembling this first pizza

10:15.198 --> 10:18.368
Now because we can't go to
the pantry, we can't pivot.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.621
Ten minutes left.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.498
Oh no!

10:23.540 --> 10:25.458
My pizza flips over in the oven

10:25.500 --> 10:26.918
as I'm trying to get it out.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.837
This pizza is ruined!

10:28.878 --> 10:30.505
We have no more dough!

10:36.428 --> 10:37.721
Eight minutes.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.139
- How is it?
- Good.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.516
Is it good? Let me see.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.560
Perfect. Oh my God.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.229
Mom, this pizza's ruined!

10:46.271 --> 10:48.815
Well, we have no more dough.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.734
Does anybody have pizza dough?

10:50.775 --> 10:53.319
- Why would we have dough?
- I don't know.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.196
Oh my God.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.490
We're not going to go out
without pizza on those plates.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.160
We can cut these
into three if we have to.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.955
I'm the mom. My role in life
is to be the pivot person.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.083
We cut the pizzas
and we get the job done.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.294
Ah, this looks good.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.212
- Two minutes.
- Hot pan behind.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.465
- Milan! Watch out.
- Hot.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.009
You got the green onion right
there, you put on top the gravy.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.886
Next, next, next,
hurry we got one minute.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.890
Oh, my God. Hurry.
Get everything on the plate.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.224
22 seconds.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.310
This is not very pretty.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.187
I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.899
Three, two, one.
Time's up. Hands up.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.988
Hi Khalil and Willie.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.573
We call it,
A Tale of Two Cities.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.950
- I was born in Detroit--
- Let's go.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.994
And lived half of my life there.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.206
We made a Coney Dog,
chili cheese fries

11:46.247 --> 11:47.874
and cilantro jalapeno.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.169
How did you get that incredible
snap on the hot dog?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.421
We steamed it in
chicken broth first.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.674
- This has heart.
- That $10,000...

11:55.715 --> 11:57.217
What would you do with it?

11:57.258 --> 11:59.177
I would use it to start
a pop up restaurant.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.638
- I love that.
- Thank you.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.223
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.850
At elementary school
I used to go to Ava's Café

12:05.892 --> 12:08.478
and people who work there are
physically impaired people,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.397
so it's near and dear
to my heart.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.898
Wow.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.109
I have a burger and potato chips

12:14.150 --> 12:16.569
with our own Indian flair
to each of the elements.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.530
Flavor is banging.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.948
Kaj and Liz.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.408
Being from New Orleans,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.326
you get po'boys
in every single corner.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.578
There you go. Do what she does.
You just get in there.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.747
We did a fried shrimp
remoulade sauce

12:27.789 --> 12:30.458
and a Vietnamese slaw
with lime juice and fish sauce.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.336
- Wow. I love that sauce.
- Thanks.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.088
Our community is very Italian.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.589
I'm not a big pizza maker,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.466
so I thought I'd go
out of my comfort zone,

12:38.508 --> 12:41.136
In my opinion
not my proudest dish, but...

12:41.886 --> 12:44.514
But you're just hard
on yourself. I can relate.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.350
- We're always our worst critic.
- Thank you.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.519
We love going
to taco trucks

12:49.561 --> 12:52.605
and our favorite tacos
are birria tacos.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.315
We made some
handmade tortillas,

12:54.357 --> 12:58.403
a consommé, and a roasted
garlic tomato sauce.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.531
I've actually never had
a taco like this.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.575
- Love it.
- Thank you, chef.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.910
Jack and Bobbie,
take us to your neighborhood.

13:05.952 --> 13:10.331
My mom grew up in New Mexico,
so we have a Navajo taco,

13:10.373 --> 13:13.251
so it's basically a
pita bread with some chorizo,

13:13.293 --> 13:16.296
some dry rub, and avocado salsa.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.340
- The fry bread, so beautiful.
- Yeah.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.925
In Alaska during the summer,
we have our own garden.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.594
So whenever we eat burgers,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.304
we always have grilled
vegetables on the side.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.431
So this is a burger
with grilled veggies.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.433
- But no moose, right?
- Nope.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.310
Dang, I really wanted
to have some moose today.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.604
There's no way we
could have gotten it, no.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.314
All right, Ocean.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.149
Whenever I think
of my hometown,

13:36.191 --> 13:38.651
this is what always comes to
mind for me. It's a loco moco.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.987
I used to live in Hawaii.
I ate tons of loco moco.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.113
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.782
So it's just that rice,

13:43.823 --> 13:46.242
the patty and egg, and the
brown gravy over top.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.994
And it's such a simple dish.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.164
But at the same time,
it's such an amazing dish.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.499
Hello.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.209
You come to our neighborhood,

13:54.250 --> 13:55.502
the one restaurant that's
always stayed around

13:55.543 --> 13:57.379
is this place called Rocku.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.381
This is a little riff off one
of their classic dishes

13:59.422 --> 14:00.840
coconut fish curry.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.676
What did you borrow
from your neighbors?

14:02.717 --> 14:04.636
We had some halibut and we
had some coconut milk.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.971
But the rest we really had to
get from everyone around us.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.848
Thank you so much.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.227
Nyesha, which dishes could
have used a little more help.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.647
Eva and Jenn, your pizza
had a ton of flavor,

14:15.689 --> 14:19.484
but your dough was undercooked
and too thick.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.903
Kennedy and Rosie.
Gorgeous presentation,

14:21.945 --> 14:25.365
but it left my palate
wanting more flavor.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.618
Ocean and Jaydene,
your loco moco

14:28.660 --> 14:32.288
was heavily under seasoned
and your patty was very dense.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.500
Nyesha, which chefs showed

14:35.542 --> 14:37.335
that they were good neighbors
today?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.045
Anika and Anu. Wow.

14:39.087 --> 14:43.133
I mean, your burger was
absolutely explosive.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.135
It truly took my palate
on a journey.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.554
- Thank you.
- Khalil and Willie.

14:47.595 --> 14:51.975
How truly imaginative to steam
your hot dog in chicken stock.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.144
I mean, flavor on flavor.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.062
- Thank you.
- Delilah and Danny.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.981
What a powerhouse of a plate.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.693
Amazing flavors and the meat
was cooked phenomenally.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.862
Yeah, I can't eat a taco
any other way now.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.573
The winners of this challenge

15:06.614 --> 15:09.200
truly showed us
where they came from.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.371
Khalil and Willie.

15:17.125 --> 15:22.422
We have immunity, and not only
immunity, $10,000.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.049
that's a $10,000
Coney right there.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.508
$10,000 Coney.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.594
Khalil and Willie,
our friends at State Farm

15:27.635 --> 15:30.847
congratulate you on taking home
the $10,000 prize.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.683
Nyesha, thank you so much
for joining us this challenge.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.019
Good luck chefs.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.233
Chefs, your next challenge
is going to be super sweet.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.825
Please put your hands together
for your next guest judge.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.662
He's an award winning pastry
chef and chocolate maker.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.791
And he designs treats

15:57.832 --> 15:59.501
for all your favorite
celebrities.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.462
- Who?
- It's Chris Ford.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.633
How is everybody?

16:06.675 --> 16:08.468
I'm very excited to be here.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.637
I can't wait to see all
your creative skills.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.847
I like dessert, who doesn't?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.850
Everybody's scared.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.478
Dessert is not our forte.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.605
It's like these precise
measurements,

16:20.647 --> 16:24.359
these exact temperatures.
Everything has to be perfect.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.112
For your elimination challenge

16:27.153 --> 16:30.490
each chef team must create
a show-stopping dessert

16:30.532 --> 16:33.493
because tomorrow we're going
to have 20 guests

16:33.535 --> 16:36.663
and a very special
friend of mine.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.417
Dancer, singer, actress, icon.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.711
Jojo Siwa.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.844
The theme for tomorrow's dessert
party is fire and ice.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.303
We want you to create

16:52.345 --> 16:54.055
a full spectrum
of over-the-top deserts.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.808
Fire and ice can mean the
temperature of your dish,

16:56.850 --> 16:59.477
but also the color,
the cooking technique,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.646
the ingredients,
or how you present it.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.773
Get creative and show
us your imagination,

17:03.815 --> 17:07.444
And Chris has some things that
will help you before you plan.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.404
You guys can come on down here.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.698
When I thought of
the fire and ice thing,

17:11.740 --> 17:14.159
I thought of melted chocolate
and ice cold water.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.287
So you want to use a dark
chocolate, just pipe.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.705
When the chocolate
hits the water,

17:18.747 --> 17:20.540
it spirals down
and it crystallizes.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.542
Wow, that's really cool.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.294
You can mold it underneath
the water

17:24.336 --> 17:25.628
because it's still
crystallizing.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.922
- And then you have that.
- Awesome.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.591
I'm more excited now.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.428
So another thing I want to show
is airbrush.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.181
Very cool.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.308
So you go close,
it's very intense,

17:38.350 --> 17:40.226
you go far, it's very light.

17:40.268 --> 17:44.773
We love drawing, so I love
the airbrush concept.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.816
Let your inner
artist come out

17:46.858 --> 17:48.860
because you want everyone
to be like,

17:48.902 --> 17:51.154
"Whoa, I've never seen that
before, how'd you make that?"

17:51.196 --> 17:54.699
Thank you, Chris. Chefs, you
have a lot of work to do.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.243
See you tomorrow
and you can go menu plan.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.495
Good luck.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.997
- All right.
- Fire and ice.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.208
- Since we have immunity--
- We've got to go crazy.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.001
Like we gotta go crazy.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.671
So fire can be hot stuff,
spicy stuff.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.172
Or just the presentation,

18:09.214 --> 18:10.924
if you like, do something red.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.801
This is
not my comfort zone.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.512
The first thought I had,
this scoop of ice cream

18:15.553 --> 18:17.305
- that's on fire.
- Okay, how--

18:17.347 --> 18:18.765
It's something
I've seen online.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.101
I've never done
flaming ice cream before,

18:21.142 --> 18:23.770
so I'm a little nervous. But
throughout the competition,

18:23.812 --> 18:25.563
the people that have been
not taking enough risks

18:25.605 --> 18:28.274
- have been going home.
- For our fire element

18:28.316 --> 18:29.943
we're going to go
with the ginger

18:29.984 --> 18:32.654
and black pepper brownie,
and then for our cold element

18:32.696 --> 18:34.698
we can do peppermint ice cream.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.367
I think we have enough elements
what you're talking about.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.660
Oh, hot fudge.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.161
Now you're
going to add more to it?

18:40.203 --> 18:42.038
I think it's really, really,
really hard.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.623
Two minutes.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.125
How do you spell meringue?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.751
I have no clue.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.962
You love to flambé.
I think we should do a flambé.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.840
Oh, I can flambé things
and I'm like, yes.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.967
You know that pineapple dessert
I always wanted to make?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.468
We love to make dessert.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.345
Back home, we like doing
the chocolate work,

18:57.387 --> 18:59.514
the sugar work,
and everything.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.141
I feel confident.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.185
Coffee ice cream, espresso,
any cinnamon candies?

19:04.227 --> 19:05.687
I think it's doing too much.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.647
Everything was a battle.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.274
I'm a little nervous because

19:09.315 --> 19:12.485
the teamwork is already off
to a really bumpy start.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.903
We've got to step it up.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.489
I just hope when we cook,
we get along.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.783
Otherwise, it's going
to be a hot mess.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.910
Don't leave us behind.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.461
Heavy cream, heavy cream,
heavy cream.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.130
- Can you save me some cream?
- No.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.883
People! It seems like
they're all making ice cream

19:34.924 --> 19:36.760
for the fire and Ice Challenge.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.678
I need more cream.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.180
Is there anymore?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.557
We really need to make
our ice cream

19:42.599 --> 19:45.518
stand out from the crowd.
Oh, extract.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.271
- I need sugar, sugar, sugar.
- Sugar? I got sugar.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.856
We need more.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.483
Fire.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.776
Heavy cream goes straight in?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.277
Heavy cream straight in.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.488
You know, I've never made
ice cream before, right?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.366
I guess it's going to have to be
a first time for everything.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.117
Do you
make dessert a lot?

20:01.159 --> 20:02.619
Absolutely not.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.912
Good thing you have immunity,
guys.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.413
Well, we swinging
for the fences.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.664
Ha ha ha.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.249
Still not red enough

20:08.291 --> 20:09.876
Dude, that is plenty red.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.379
We're going to show fire
with red velvet cake.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.256
But I have to triple this,
20 portions, that's crazy.

20:15.298 --> 20:18.635
And then do a cayenne
buttercream icing.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.428
- That's it.
- It works?

20:20.470 --> 20:22.138
Oh, cool, looks like ice too.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.724
Chris Ford shows us like all
these cool tricks.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.310
He created this beautiful
crystallized chocolate.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.313
And I know it's very
similar to tanghulu.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.731
Ooh, and I like the chunks,

20:31.773 --> 20:33.358
they kind of look like a thing
of ice.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.277
Tanghuluis this amazing way
to eat sugar.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.488
Where then you can dip stuff
in and it cools down

20:38.530 --> 20:40.448
really quickly
to make fruits look like

20:40.490 --> 20:43.952
they've been encased in ice.
My first tanghulu.How's that?

20:43.993 --> 20:45.912
- Oh!
- That's alright.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.164
One hour and 20 minutes.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.209
I'm starting my ice cream

20:51.251 --> 20:53.169
because that's going to take
the longest.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.673
We're making a custard based
ice cream using egg yolks.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.466
Oh a custard,
that sounds nice.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.177
Yeah, so it's like egg yolks
as a thickener.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.472
And we're doing
the heavy cream,

21:04.514 --> 21:07.517
milk and sugar heating that
until it's thickened

21:07.559 --> 21:09.728
and then putting it in
liquid nitrogen.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.063
Oh God, Anika.
I'm running behind.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.524
Mom, don't worry, we'll get
it done in time.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.942
I hope.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.031
In Mexico,
we love eating mangonadas.

21:21.072 --> 21:25.744
So our plan is to make
a cold mango mousse.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.328
So, that's gonna be our ice.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.330
And then the hot part is
going to be a chamoy.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.791
The Chamoy is basically
dehydrated fruit

21:31.833 --> 21:34.627
that's blended into like
a thick, spicy paste

21:34.669 --> 21:36.755
Squeeze a good
chunk of lime in there.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.971
Is it good? Too spicy? What?

21:45.013 --> 21:46.556
It's Korean chili powder,

21:46.598 --> 21:48.641
So I don't think we want
very much of it.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.518
This is my challenge to win.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.103
It's really hot.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.856
Because I make
tarts so often at home.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.317
I'm so good at it.
I can do this.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.027
So for our fire element
we're going to make

21:59.069 --> 22:01.112
a spicy chocolate tart.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.906
Let's do this.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.532
For our Ice Element.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.743
We're not very comfortable
with making ice cream,

22:06.785 --> 22:09.412
so we're going to have
a liquid nitrogen

22:09.454 --> 22:12.957
raspberries on top.
They're frozen. Look at that.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.794
Kennedy works a lot
with fruit tarts.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.587
She's very good at pastry.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.923
so that makes us kind
of nervous.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.841
Ooh, that looks cool
over there.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.970
Okay, now we got to cut these
so we can fold them in.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.722
Jack, what is your inspiration?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.558
I love cherries, I love ice
cream, and I love pineapple.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.268
So we're going to do

22:32.310 --> 22:36.564
a orange pancake with flambé
pineapple, cherry ice cream.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.191
Nice.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.777
45 minutes.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.362
Liquid nitrogen time.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.157
Look like a scientist.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.243
How's that going?

22:48.284 --> 22:50.203
This ice cream is going
to be so good.

22:50.829 --> 22:52.914
Ice cream's in
the blast chiller.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.671
- Hello.
- What's going on?

22:59.713 --> 23:01.840
We're making a sticky
toffee pudding

23:01.881 --> 23:04.300
with a warm toffee sauce.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.720
Along with
cinnamon espresso ice cream.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.597
For the fire, we're going to
blowtorch caramelized peaches.

23:09.639 --> 23:10.932
- Nice.
- Love it.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.475
And the ice is the ice cream,

23:12.517 --> 23:14.686
And I'm going to dance,
the fire and ice dance.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.187
That's the fire part.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.607
Now, put them in there. Here.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.317
How many eggs did
you put in there

23:21.359 --> 23:23.653
I'm trying to get everything
but I need you to do it.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.071
I'm going to go get
the kids out.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.489
I need you to focus on this

23:26.531 --> 23:28.158
because nothing else
matters right now.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.993
- Ocean. How are you doing?
- I'm good.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.619
Tell me about
the concept.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.122
So the concept was to take our
goddesses from back home

23:34.164 --> 23:36.249
Pele, which is the
goddess of fire,

23:36.291 --> 23:38.501
and then Poli'ahu,
the goddess of snow and ice.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.503
We wanted to put that inside
of a glass.

23:40.545 --> 23:41.838
Stop. Wait what?

23:41.880 --> 23:43.340
That's fire, ice, drama,
okay, I love it.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.675
We're not just local kids
from the islands,

23:45.717 --> 23:47.218
we're actually Native Hawaiian.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.262
So that's why it's
been so important

23:49.304 --> 23:51.181
for us to really cook
our heritage

23:51.222 --> 23:53.975
and elevate our people
and our culture.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.810
I mean, no pressure,
but I cannot wait.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.104
Thank you,
ocean and Jaydene

24:02.150 --> 24:05.070
Milan and Chandrani, what's up?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.155
We're making
a brownie shortbread

24:07.197 --> 24:09.449
meringue and flaming ice cream.
That's the important part.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.993
- That's fire and ice!
- We really wanted to go all out

24:12.035 --> 24:13.620
on the fire and ice
so we're literally

24:13.661 --> 24:14.913
putting ice cream on fire.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.664
Have you done any
of this before?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.375
Never made ice cream before.
We're using liquid nitrogen.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.001
Wow I cannot wait, yes.
The wow effect.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.419
We're doing all kinds of stuff.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.421
- Good luck.
- I want to go all the way

24:23.463 --> 24:25.298
with this fire
and ice technique.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.550
I want to see what we can
really do if we push ourselves

24:27.592 --> 24:29.761
Get the ice cream
and then we're in good place.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.388
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck.

24:31.429 --> 24:35.016
- Oh no. Oh, my God.
- What?

24:35.058 --> 24:38.603
The cakes are totally messed up.
We have to redo them.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.397
The texture is not right.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.691
We don't have enough batter
to make 20 more cakes.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.693
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.533
The cakes are burnt, mom.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.076
Only the tops are burnt.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.870
We're cutting the tops off,
get a good knife.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.374
They overflowed and the tops
got a little overcooked,

24:59.416 --> 25:02.836
but I will cut off
all the muffin tops.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.379
Be nice guys.
Be nice.

25:04.421 --> 25:06.923
Never. Always
a battle royale.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.220
Go, go, go, go.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.687
- Did anybody make ice cream?
- I did.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.273
Anika really took
on the fire and ice aspect

25:23.314 --> 25:25.859
because she made blue ice cream.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.610
So what did you make?

25:27.652 --> 25:29.612
We made chocolate tarts, going
to drizzle on the chocolate

25:29.654 --> 25:31.656
and then just put the
frozen fruit on top.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.158
And?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.160
We definitely could have
done more techniques

25:35.201 --> 25:36.870
for our ice element.

25:36.911 --> 25:38.455
The white stripes look cool.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.086
Hi, welcome.

25:46.087 --> 25:49.299
I am so pumped up, dessert
is the only thing that I eat.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.593
This is an awesome challenge

25:51.634 --> 25:53.803
because they're really outside
their comfort zone.

25:53.845 --> 25:56.264
It's also they have to put
on a little show for us, right?

25:56.306 --> 25:57.974
And the flavor
has got to be there, too.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.559
I cannot wait to see
the creativity.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.895
- There's nine desserts?
- Yeah.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.188
Wow!

26:04.314 --> 26:05.940
What's on the menu?

26:05.982 --> 26:07.609
Are you ready to try something?

26:07.650 --> 26:08.735
Thank you.

26:08.777 --> 26:09.778
The fun one.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.488
I'm impressed by that.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.697
So exciting.

26:16.659 --> 26:17.952
Who's ready for dessert?

26:17.994 --> 26:19.704
I am.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.122
We've gotta add more ice.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.665
All right, smack it.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.875
Whoa.

26:23.917 --> 26:25.377
- Wow.
- Look at the ice.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.003
We made a red velvet cake

26:27.045 --> 26:29.714
with a spicy cayenne infused
cream cheese frosting.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.175
And we did that strawberry
tanghuluon the top

26:32.217 --> 26:33.468
because it kind of looks like

26:33.510 --> 26:35.178
the strawberry is
encased in ice.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.680
And then for the fire,

26:36.721 --> 26:38.348
we did the red velvet
and there's cayenne.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.475
Presentation is fire.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.935
Thank you.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.020
Oh, the strawberry's candy.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.606
I really liked
the presentation there.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.566
- That ice.
- That ice, that was fun.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.193
It was,
like, a showstopper,

26:50.235 --> 26:51.820
but the cake is too much sugar.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.072
I couldn't eat much more
than I already ate of it,

26:54.114 --> 26:55.657
and I only ate two bites of it.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.659
I just wanted more
of the cayenne.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.536
Help me.

26:59.577 --> 27:00.995
How am I supposed
to help you?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.497
Hello, Eva and Jenn.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.332
I'm trying to scoop?
Oh, my God, this is so--

27:04.374 --> 27:06.167
- From the bottom.
- I'm trying to.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.545
The ice cream is melting.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.047
Oh, my God.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.466
We made you a sticky
toffee pudding

27:13.508 --> 27:15.719
and caramelized
blowtorch peaches

27:15.760 --> 27:18.263
with a cinnamon espresso
ice cream.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.806
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.891
- Great job. We're excited.
- Eat it quickly.

27:25.562 --> 27:28.064
I love the thematics
of the sticky toffee,

27:28.106 --> 27:30.358
but the toffee cake
is dry inside.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.527
But the ice cream to make it
with liquid nitrogen

27:32.569 --> 27:34.988
and the texture to be that great
captures the challenge,

27:35.030 --> 27:37.198
but I'm missing that fire.

27:37.532 --> 27:39.868
The presentation was
very uncomfortable.

27:39.909 --> 27:42.078
I love them and I know that
they're full of chaos,

27:42.120 --> 27:43.663
but I don't want to see it.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.711
Hi, Kaj and Liz.

27:49.753 --> 27:53.381
Hello, we did a spin on
New Orleans beignets and coffee.

27:53.423 --> 27:55.842
We made a coffee milkshake
with the liquid nitrogen

27:55.884 --> 27:57.218
and we have the hot beignets

27:57.260 --> 27:59.262
with a cinnamon powdered
sugar dust

27:59.304 --> 28:00.972
and you got to shake it.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.849
I'm so excited,
let's go shake it and eat it.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.392
Let's go shake and eat.
Thanks guys.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.603
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.813
Oh, my God.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.231
It smells so good.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.317
I just want to send it.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.735
Coffee milkshake, oh, my God,

28:13.777 --> 28:15.570
that's the most delicious
thing I've ever had.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.322
- Oh, my.
- The presentation is fun.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.990
It's not the best beignet
I've ever had.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.451
Not as light and fluffy,
but the flavors are there.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.120
Fire and ice.
They did a good job, I think.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.122
Yeah, for sure.

28:27.248 --> 28:30.460
- Hi, Danny and Delilah.
- Hi.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.962
We have a cold sun,
as we like to call it,

28:33.004 --> 28:36.633
and it's a cold mango mousse,
chamoy filling inside,

28:36.675 --> 28:39.386
almond au poivre cake
on the bottom.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.012
So right now it's about noon.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.263
We're going to put it to sunset.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.141
Oh. I love it.

28:45.183 --> 28:46.851
So now, it's sunset.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.604
So this is just a mixture
of sprinkles and chili powder.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.189
- Bringing the heat.
- Beautiful.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.607
I got some glitter
for you, Jojo.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.192
Yeah.

28:54.234 --> 28:56.277
- Thank you.
- Thank you judges.

28:57.612 --> 28:58.947
So fancy.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.782
Whoa, wait, a second.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.242
Stunning.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.618
Oh, it's so good.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.537
I love it. The textures.
It's gooey.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.622
It's creamy,
that cross-section.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.499
And that's like what
it's all about.

29:09.541 --> 29:12.043
It makes me feel like I'm at
a really fancy restaurant,

29:12.085 --> 29:13.920
and I just paid $56 for this.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.213
I'm loving this challenge.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.465
- I like this.
- Good, right?

29:17.507 --> 29:19.384
Ice cream
a little bit runny.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.969
It's like a sauce.

29:21.011 --> 29:23.304
Oh, my God, this ice cream
is not holding up.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.764
We'll freeze it.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.560
Careful, put your hand
directly under it.

29:29.019 --> 29:30.729
Where's the lighter?

29:30.770 --> 29:33.732
Ocean and Jaydene,
what did you make for us?

29:33.773 --> 29:36.192
The name of our dish is the
Battle of the Goddesses.

29:36.234 --> 29:37.777
Woah!

29:37.819 --> 29:39.988
On the bottom, we got a
coconut tres leches cake.

29:40.030 --> 29:42.532
On top of that is a blue
vanilla maca nut ice cream.

29:42.574 --> 29:44.617
On top of that is a
passionfruit curd

29:44.659 --> 29:46.661
topped off with a little bit
of coconut.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.663
And who doesn't like
a little rum with that?

29:48.705 --> 29:51.916
- Oh, they got the fire.
- Yeah.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.085
That's what I'm talking about,
fire and ice,

29:54.127 --> 29:56.129
- Heck, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

29:56.171 --> 29:58.548
That is beautiful,
thank you.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.217
Oh my gosh, it's getting
better and better.

30:01.259 --> 30:02.927
The presentation is amazing.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.512
Oh, so refreshing.

30:04.554 --> 30:06.014
It's so refreshing.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.599
I'm in Hawaii on the beach.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.310
I love things that are
sour, and it's just good

30:10.352 --> 30:12.187
That passionfruit curd on top.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.897
It is sour. It's tart,

30:13.938 --> 30:17.442
but you need that to get the
ice cream. So it's so smart.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.569
Let's hope it all works.
We've done it twice.

30:19.611 --> 30:22.322
Oh boy, what is happening?

30:24.282 --> 30:26.284
- Whoa.
- Okay.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.036
Fancy.

30:28.078 --> 30:29.829
Look at the execution.

30:29.871 --> 30:33.208
We have our pirates pineapple,
rum, orange zest, pound cake.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.377
And we've got it amarena
cherry ice cream

30:35.418 --> 30:37.545
with Amarena sugar cherry bomb.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.214
That ice cream looks good.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.257
Thank you.

30:45.303 --> 30:46.888
Are we cherrying it?

30:46.930 --> 30:48.181
Arrr. Cheers.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.933
That's so good.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.602
Cherry is one of
the hardest things

30:52.644 --> 30:54.646
in ice cream to get right.
And they nailed it.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.898
This is like the best cherry
ice cream I've ever had.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.110
- Yeah.
- Simple dessert, but delicious.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.904
This is directly
from the blast freezer.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.823
- Pop them out.
- But don't break it.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.909
We're trying to pull it out
of this little scoops.

31:07.951 --> 31:11.621
Now we realize it's gone
from liquid to really hard.

31:12.539 --> 31:13.957
But don't break it.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.166
Hello

31:22.882 --> 31:25.468
This is directly
from the blast freezer.

31:25.510 --> 31:26.845
Oh, my God.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.014
But don't break it.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.432
Milan and Chandrani,

31:30.473 --> 31:31.850
what is your fire and ice?

31:31.891 --> 31:33.685
We have shortbread brownie,

31:33.727 --> 31:36.187
vanilla ice cream with this
meringue over it all.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.731
Nice.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.691
We are doing a very literal
interpretation,

31:39.733 --> 31:41.276
lighting our ice cream on fire.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.610
Oh.

31:42.652 --> 31:44.320
It's flaming.

31:44.362 --> 31:46.072
Yes, Milan. You go Milan.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.366
- I love it.
- Thank you so much.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.827
- Thank you.
- That was so stressful.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.706
Uh oh, this is,
like, really frozen.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.374
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.460
The ice cream should not have
gone out last minute.

31:58.501 --> 31:59.961
They need to temper
a little bit.

32:00.003 --> 32:02.213
Yeah, I feel like if
the brownie part was hot

32:02.255 --> 32:04.215
it would have melted the
ice cream a little bit.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.718
I love the concept,
but textures here are off

32:06.760 --> 32:08.511
and that's why it doesn't
eat light.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.472
It doesn't really have
a lot of flavor.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.225
Hi, Kennedy and Rosie.
What did you make for us?

32:14.267 --> 32:15.977
We have an angry chocolate tart.

32:16.019 --> 32:18.730
There's Korean
chilli flakes and cayenne.

32:18.772 --> 32:20.607
That's our fire aspect,
for the ice

32:20.648 --> 32:23.443
is the frozen blueberries
with the white drizzle.

32:23.485 --> 32:24.527
Thank you.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.196
Thank you.

32:27.238 --> 32:28.656
Korean chilli flakes.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.408
- Is it spicy?
- No, you'll be all right.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.702
It's very elegant. You could
buy this in a pastry shop.

32:32.744 --> 32:35.789
The filling is amazing,
but I want an ice cream.

32:35.830 --> 32:37.749
- It's fire and ice.
- I wanted more ice.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.417
Because it's like chocolate
with chocolate

32:39.459 --> 32:41.252
with a little bit of chocolate.

32:41.294 --> 32:44.631
I know Kennedy can just shoot a
little bit more ambitious, yeah.

32:46.091 --> 32:47.467
Thank you.

32:47.509 --> 32:49.010
Need a glass of milk
to go with it.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.387
Yeah, some milk would be great.

32:50.428 --> 32:52.013
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.807
Anika,  tell us what
you made for us.

32:53.848 --> 32:55.767
So we wanted to showcase
the fire and ice theme

32:55.809 --> 32:57.811
in three ways.
First is the temperature.

32:57.852 --> 33:00.313
So we have cayenne pepper
hot fudge.

33:00.355 --> 33:03.191
The second is the flavor,
it's a peppermint ice cream

33:03.233 --> 33:05.235
and a ginger
black pepper brownie.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.237
And then the last one
is the decorations.

33:07.278 --> 33:11.116
We have a candy melt snowflake
and a sugar shard,

33:11.157 --> 33:13.368
- Is it spicy?
- It's a little bit spicy,

33:13.410 --> 33:15.829
just gets you in the back
of the throat, not too much.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.414
Thank you so much, guys.

33:17.455 --> 33:19.499
Thank you, I hope you
enjoy.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.043
Oh, this looks amazing.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.461
Yes flavor.

33:23.503 --> 33:24.838
That brownie is good.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.464
I've heard cayenne all day,

33:26.506 --> 33:27.674
but we have spice.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.134
It's a beautiful little note.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.136
The color of that ice cream,
it pops

33:31.177 --> 33:33.805
and then also the textures,
the warm fudge.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.932
It's really fire and ice.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.102
Thanks.

33:41.521 --> 33:43.523
There was a lot of chocolate.

33:44.649 --> 33:46.276
These kids were amazing.

33:46.317 --> 33:48.278
All of them don't cook
a lot of pastries,

33:48.319 --> 33:49.988
and I felt that they took

33:50.030 --> 33:51.990
the challenge that you gave
them and made it their own.

33:52.032 --> 33:53.992
I don't know how we're going to
pick somebody.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.536
You're going to be out of a job
with these kids coming out.

33:57.037 --> 33:58.830
Chefs, you can head
to the rec room

33:58.872 --> 34:00.081
and we'll call you soon.

34:00.123 --> 34:02.042
Bye!

34:07.547 --> 34:09.132
Ugh...

34:09.174 --> 34:11.384
- Yours looked so pretty.
- Thank you.

34:11.426 --> 34:15.889
Was it as crazy for everyone
as we felt it was for us?

34:17.057 --> 34:20.185
Maybe not quite as
crazy as it was for y'all.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.561
Yes.

34:21.603 --> 34:24.272
Hi everyone.

34:24.314 --> 34:26.024
Oh no.

34:26.066 --> 34:27.859
We would like to see
the following chefs

34:27.901 --> 34:30.737
at judges table.
Anika and Anu.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.573
Milan and Chandrani.

34:34.282 --> 34:36.701
Kennedy and Rosie.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.953
Delilah and Danny.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.664
Eva and Jenn.

34:42.916 --> 34:44.793
Ocean and Jaydene.

34:45.585 --> 34:46.920
Thank you.

34:48.046 --> 34:50.298
Go get em. Good luck, everyone.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.217
Oh.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.602
Pastries are different.

35:02.644 --> 35:05.814
You have to be a scientist
and a chef at the same time.

35:05.855 --> 35:07.607
These were delicious,

35:07.649 --> 35:09.609
but also technically
sound dishes.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.236
Anika and Anu.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.570
Delilah and Danny.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.322
Ocean and Jaydene.

35:14.364 --> 35:17.367
Please stay here. The rest of
you may step to the side.

35:21.121 --> 35:24.165
You three chef teams
are standing here because...

35:26.835 --> 35:29.921
You made our favorite desserts
of the night. Congratulations.

35:29.963 --> 35:31.673
That's a big pause.

35:34.467 --> 35:35.885
Good job guys.

35:38.221 --> 35:41.266
Ocean and Jaydene,
that presentation.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.475
I was loving it.

35:42.517 --> 35:43.935
Who came up with this idea?

35:43.977 --> 35:45.937
We already had that story
about our heritage

35:45.979 --> 35:47.605
and we just wanted to
put it into a dish.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.941
We also wanted to challenge
ourselves by trying foods

35:49.983 --> 35:51.401
that we don't normally do.

35:51.443 --> 35:53.445
These layers that you
guys delivered,

35:53.486 --> 35:55.447
even when you're outside
your comfort zone.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.949
This might be the round
where you learn

35:57.991 --> 35:59.951
the most about yourself
as a team.

35:59.993 --> 36:02.954
Story was amazing.
The flavors were on point.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.497
We felt like we were in Hawaii.

36:04.539 --> 36:07.625
It's a dish that should
be served everywhere.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.586
Thank you.

36:09.627 --> 36:11.755
Anika and Anu,
you literally had

36:11.796 --> 36:14.299
the hot and cold
in every single layer.

36:14.341 --> 36:16.634
You were like, What's the
challenge? I got you.

36:16.676 --> 36:18.178
Thank you.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.472
The brownie part of it
was so soft and so gooey,

36:20.513 --> 36:22.682
and the mint almost made the
ice cream feel colder

36:22.724 --> 36:24.601
and it was brilliant.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.895
I would have never put
all those things together,

36:26.936 --> 36:28.646
but a perfect marriage.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.648
In this team energy spirit.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.108
How's it working out now?

36:32.150 --> 36:33.818
I think she knows what
she's doing.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.153
I just get frantic
and she's like,

36:35.195 --> 36:36.988
"Calm down, mom,
we got this."

36:38.156 --> 36:41.242
Delilah and Danny,
whose idea was this dessert?

36:41.284 --> 36:44.496
Well, I thought of the
idea of Mangonadas,

36:44.537 --> 36:47.540
and Danny thought of the
idea to turn it into a mousse.

36:47.582 --> 36:50.752
And I was blown away. I mean,
everything was perfect.

36:50.794 --> 36:52.504
The layers, the placement,

36:52.545 --> 36:55.006
that's very hard to achieve.
That could be easily served

36:55.048 --> 36:57.133
- in any four star restaurant.
- Thank you, chef.

36:57.175 --> 36:59.010
You're a little cooking genius.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.512
I was like,
"Whoa, I didn't even know

37:00.553 --> 37:03.223
things could taste like this."
Beautiful.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.766
Thank you.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.227
Jojo, you get to announce
the winner.

37:08.395 --> 37:11.898
The chefs who had our favorite
dish today

37:11.940 --> 37:14.609
gave us an experience
in their presentation

37:14.651 --> 37:16.486
and in their dessert.

37:23.118 --> 37:25.203
Ocean and Jaydene.

37:25.245 --> 37:26.496
Congrats!

37:26.538 --> 37:29.457
Congratulations!

37:30.750 --> 37:32.210
I'm going to take the credit

37:32.252 --> 37:34.129
for being right
in this challenge.

37:34.170 --> 37:36.381
We somehow won, I guess my
curd came out pretty right.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.801
It was my curd, but I'll give
Ocean a little bit of credit.

37:39.843 --> 37:42.971
His willingness to keep
going with certain elements

37:43.013 --> 37:44.931
in the dish
really pulled through.

37:44.973 --> 37:47.100
That's the first time
he's hugged me.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.895
Congratulations,
Ocean and Jaydene.

37:50.937 --> 37:52.981
You may now step to the side.

37:56.109 --> 38:00.030
Eva and Jenn, Kennedy and Rosie,
Milan and Chandrani,

38:00.071 --> 38:02.073
You had our least favorite
dishes of the night.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.534
One team here
will be going home.

38:12.167 --> 38:15.253
Kennedy and Rosie, how did the
challenge go for you today?

38:15.295 --> 38:16.546
I felt really confident
in our dish

38:16.588 --> 38:18.298
just because I make it
so much at home.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.966
The tart was amazing.
It was elegant.

38:20.008 --> 38:22.260
It was beautiful, could be on
a cover of a magazine,

38:22.302 --> 38:24.637
but I just wanted something to
cut through all of that.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.890
I wanted one more
different flavor,

38:26.931 --> 38:28.391
like an ice cream on top.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.560
We were not very confident
making ice cream.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.104
I guess my tip would
be maybe whipped cream.

38:34.064 --> 38:37.150
Eva and Jenn tell me how
you approached this challenge.

38:37.192 --> 38:38.777
We like to make desserts a lot

38:38.818 --> 38:41.488
and we're confident
in how we did,

38:41.529 --> 38:43.990
The key ingredients
were delicious.

38:44.032 --> 38:45.658
The coffee ice cream
was amazing.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.035
So, good.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.995
You brought some caramel
to that, nice,

38:49.037 --> 38:50.830
but it ate dry
in the middle.

38:50.872 --> 38:52.916
Also too, your presentation.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.877
We could tell there was tension
between you two

38:55.919 --> 38:59.130
before we ate your food.
You can't let anyone see that.

38:59.172 --> 39:01.466
After everything that went
on in the kitchen

39:01.508 --> 39:03.301
with the cakes, I was, like,

39:03.343 --> 39:05.512
really like proud of myself
that we got through it

39:05.553 --> 39:07.847
and that we got-- I'm sorry--

39:07.889 --> 39:10.684
And then we got our cakes like,
you know, so we didn't have.

39:10.725 --> 39:12.811
So we weren't plateless.

39:12.852 --> 39:16.606
We pivoted so hard

39:16.648 --> 39:20.026
to get this dish
to what you got.

39:20.068 --> 39:22.195
You both want the same goal.

39:22.237 --> 39:24.531
Don't let it get
in between you two.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.534
Milan and Chandrani,

39:27.575 --> 39:29.577
you guys look like you
had a lot of fun today.

39:29.619 --> 39:31.287
I just really wanted
to serve you guys,

39:31.329 --> 39:32.914
really fire and ice.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.791
So the first thought
that came to my head was,

39:34.833 --> 39:36.876
"What if we light
some ice cream on fire?"

39:36.918 --> 39:39.045
There was two cookies, right?
There was layers?

39:39.087 --> 39:40.505
Shortbread and a brownie.

39:40.547 --> 39:42.298
I would have removed
one of those

39:42.340 --> 39:43.842
and maybe focused more
on the ice cream.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.635
And with five or ten
minutes to go.

39:45.677 --> 39:47.554
We noticed our ice cream was
completely liquid.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.597
And so I think we did a
little over on that,

39:49.639 --> 39:51.516
If it would have tempered,
you know,

39:51.558 --> 39:53.560
just take it out and let
it sit for 10 minutes.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.478
It would have been amazing.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.064
Have you ever ate
that astronaut food?

39:58.106 --> 40:02.944
That's exactly what it tasted
like to me, almost like chalk.

40:03.278 --> 40:04.446
Thank you, chefs.

40:04.487 --> 40:06.197
We have a lot to discuss.

40:06.239 --> 40:07.699
Please head back
to the rec room

40:07.741 --> 40:09.325
and we'll call you
when we're ready.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.292
What's up, what's up, what's up?

40:17.334 --> 40:18.918
Ocean is the champ.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.588
Oh, you guys won, yay.

40:21.629 --> 40:23.423
Who was in top and bottom?

40:23.465 --> 40:26.384
Top is Delilah and Danny,
and Anika and Anu.

40:26.426 --> 40:28.136
And bottom?

40:28.178 --> 40:30.805
Us, Eva and Jenn,
Kennedy and Rosie.

40:33.350 --> 40:35.643
I'm always smiling.

40:35.685 --> 40:37.437
The further we get
in this competition,

40:37.479 --> 40:39.606
the harder it is to
send someone home.

40:39.647 --> 40:41.816
We always tell them, take
chances and the team for me,

40:41.858 --> 40:45.779
that took the most chances
was Milan and Chandrani, right?

40:45.820 --> 40:48.406
They took fire
and ice to the heart,

40:48.448 --> 40:50.158
and they took over the
top to the heart.

40:50.200 --> 40:55.455
With taste, Milan and Chandrani,
had the most trouble today.

40:55.497 --> 40:57.332
And nothing went together.

40:57.374 --> 40:59.959
I'm all good.
I got to burn things today.

41:00.001 --> 41:01.378
Nothing can spoil that.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.798
Kennedy and Rosie,
this was not

41:04.839 --> 41:08.134
a competition dish, this was
something that you make at home.

41:08.176 --> 41:10.387
It was very good. It was...

41:10.428 --> 41:11.971
It was very safe.

41:12.013 --> 41:13.848
It wasn't really elevated, but--

41:13.890 --> 41:15.975
But it was put together
and it was a good dish.

41:16.017 --> 41:17.894
I don't really think it
spoke to fire or ice.

41:17.936 --> 41:20.230
There was no heat.
There was no action.

41:20.271 --> 41:21.773
And that's what the
challenge was.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.192
I was actually
kind of shocked too.

41:24.234 --> 41:26.403
Eva and Jenn's presentation.

41:26.444 --> 41:27.779
You literally hear them

41:27.821 --> 41:29.489
fighting with each other
and yelling.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.908
They did have
an amazing ice cream.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.451
Oh, my God.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.453
- The ice cream was so good.
- It was amazing.

41:35.495 --> 41:37.205
That's the emotional
rollercoaster.

41:37.247 --> 41:39.499
They were battling each other,
but they recovered together.

41:39.541 --> 41:41.584
It was more
about presentation.

41:41.626 --> 41:44.421
Yeah, not really
the dish in a whole.

41:45.338 --> 41:47.048
All right,
I think we're in agreement.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.384
Let's bring them back in.

41:58.601 --> 42:02.397
Today's challenge really
came down to execution.

42:02.439 --> 42:04.733
This is really hard,

42:04.774 --> 42:07.277
and you should be really
proud of yourself.

42:07.318 --> 42:10.697
No matter what happens. Meghan.

42:17.787 --> 42:20.373
Millen and Chandrani,
I'm so sorry.

42:20.415 --> 42:22.292
Please pack
your knives and go.

42:24.044 --> 42:25.754
It was really
an amazing experience.

42:25.795 --> 42:27.881
I made so many lifelong friends.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.966
I don't know what happens
after this,

42:30.008 --> 42:32.761
but I know, Milan,
you're going places.

42:32.802 --> 42:34.054
Oh yeah.

42:34.095 --> 42:36.097
- Thank you so much, guys.
- Thank you guys.

42:36.139 --> 42:37.932
Thank you.

42:38.683 --> 42:41.561
- Eva. You're okay.
- I'm okay.

42:41.603 --> 42:43.563
You made it another week.

42:43.605 --> 42:46.775
No more fighting you two!

42:46.816 --> 42:48.443
Goodnight.

42:50.278 --> 42:52.614
We're going home.

42:52.655 --> 42:54.699
I'm pretty bummed
to be eliminated.

42:54.741 --> 42:56.701
But even though we're all
competing here to be

42:56.743 --> 42:58.578
the top chef and be the best.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.413
It's also a lot more
than that.

43:00.455 --> 43:02.999
I'll still always watch
a @lilchefmil.

43:03.041 --> 43:06.670
These weeks we've spent together
has been just so amazing.

43:06.711 --> 43:08.755
It's left us both
stronger chefs,

43:08.797 --> 43:11.174
better mother/son relationship.

43:11.216 --> 43:13.385
I don't think we were expecting
to make it this far.

43:13.426 --> 43:15.178
I've always been a home chef.

43:15.220 --> 43:18.056
Many of the people here
make their business

43:18.098 --> 43:20.266
off of selling food at 15.

43:20.308 --> 43:21.810
I'm just a kid who makes

43:21.851 --> 43:23.853
some random TikToks
on the internet.

43:24.646 --> 43:26.231
I'd certainly love to come back

43:26.272 --> 43:28.608
on Top Chefwhen I'm older,

43:28.650 --> 43:31.569
and so I can't wait to be back.

43:34.864 --> 43:37.075
Next on Top Chef Family Style.

43:37.117 --> 43:41.371
Today is WWE Day here
at Top Chef Family Style.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.832
There is no Quickfire.

43:45.166 --> 43:47.502
Fire up the kitchen!

43:47.544 --> 43:50.255
Go time, people.
Let's go, let's get it.

43:50.296 --> 43:52.424
Here we go. Here we go.

43:52.465 --> 43:53.842
I'm scared.

43:53.883 --> 43:55.552
You need some acid
in there like a vinegar.

43:55.593 --> 43:57.637
- They got it going on.
- Calm down.

43:57.679 --> 43:58.930
This part isn't cooked.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.390
We're not going
to have pasta.

44:00.432 --> 44:01.808
Don't embarrass me.

44:01.850 --> 44:03.309
The crustini's,
don't worry about it.

44:03.351 --> 44:04.811
Danny, it's going
to take too long.

44:04.853 --> 44:06.354
I'm more nervous about this
than wrestling

44:06.396 --> 44:08.273
at WrestleMania in front
of 18,000 people.

44:08.314 --> 44:10.233
Oh my god, this is so spicy.

44:10.275 --> 44:11.818
It'll blow your head off.

44:11.860 --> 44:13.486
- Did you burn yourself?

44:13.528 --> 44:15.739
I hate this, I hate this,
I hate this.
