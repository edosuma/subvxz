WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:23.056
you're only getting
half the story.

00:23.056 --> 00:26.193
Director: That's a break
on the main stage.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.561
All cameras re-po.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.464
RuPaul: Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.366
Lady Camden.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.901
Angeria.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.336
You are safe.

00:36.336 --> 00:39.239
You may leave the stage.

00:43.610 --> 00:47.247
It seems like the judges
are really feeling

00:47.247 --> 00:50.918
what we just put down
on this stage.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.420
I was very nervous,

00:53.420 --> 00:55.789
and I'm very proud of myself.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.993
I feel happy to be safe.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.061
I feel like I did

01:01.061 --> 01:02.663
a pretty good job
in the teaser.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.532
I went for it,
that's for sure,

01:05.532 --> 01:07.501
and I think it paid off.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.071
Cameras up.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.105
Copy that. Here we go.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.408
Queens walking.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.843
-Oh.
-[sighs]

01:16.843 --> 01:18.445
Got through.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.613
All right.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.715
Oh, my goodness.
There's so many drinks.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.983
There's just so many of us.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.651
Because there's
so many of us, yeah.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.053
Come on, girl.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.721
Just in case? Okay.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.122
Let me get my baby
sorted up.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.357
That's your baby?

01:30.357 --> 01:31.758
Mommy's gonna drink now, okay?

01:34.061 --> 01:38.465
So who do we think
are the tops and the bottoms?

01:38.465 --> 01:40.500
[exhales]

01:40.500 --> 01:42.869
This one's a tricky one.

01:42.869 --> 01:46.106
I think that
the tops are DeJa,

01:46.106 --> 01:48.075
Bosco, and Willow.

01:48.075 --> 01:52.479
I think the bottoms
are Jorgeous, Daya,

01:52.479 --> 01:54.581
and Jasmine for sure.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.416
I think DeJa
did a great job as a host.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.251
Oh, I thought she did
a great job as a host.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.487
You know, I think
she was just so easy.

02:00.487 --> 02:01.888
It was fun.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.657
Like, the runway is sickening.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.158
I think she could win.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.660
Because when you say
shoulder pads,

02:06.660 --> 02:08.695
what screams shoulder pads more

02:08.695 --> 02:10.597
than fucking
six-foot-long shoulder pads?

02:10.597 --> 02:13.200
I'm just saying, bitch,
them shoulder pads

02:13.200 --> 02:14.634
is bigger than
your Nutcracker head.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.635
Seriously.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.571
♪ Duh duh-duh-duh dun ♪

02:17.571 --> 02:18.972
They're, like, we get it. Fine.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.641
[both laugh]
Oh, my God.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.410
[laughs] Willow.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.513
Girl, Willow was slaying
in the mini-challenge

02:26.513 --> 02:28.181
with them Snag Tights on.

02:28.181 --> 02:31.084
Yeah, From the panel, every time
Willow had something to say,

02:31.084 --> 02:32.586
I thought,
that's a good point.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.221
Yeah, like,
I wanna hear more

02:34.221 --> 02:35.655
of what she has to say.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.158
To get to a place
where you can be a man

02:38.158 --> 02:40.594
who's feminine openly,
it's a long road,

02:40.594 --> 02:42.529
and along the way
you get to know yourself,

02:42.529 --> 02:44.564
and that's what
I really find sexy.

02:44.564 --> 02:45.799
Absolutely.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.801
It's a shame with Daya,

02:47.801 --> 02:49.870
because I feel like
she started off really strong.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.438
Do you know?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.873
Maybe you don't agree?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.141
[laughs]

02:54.141 --> 02:55.609
I could be wrong.
I could be wrong.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.210
[laughs] No.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.281
I think that Bosco
was fabulous.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.784
And, like, literally
the moment she started talking,

03:03.784 --> 03:07.154
it reminded me of
an actual talk show host.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.455
Like, that's what
she sounded like.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.390
I was, like,
oh, I'm sold already.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.391
I agree.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.994
Today we're gonna be discussing

03:13.994 --> 03:17.064
the arousing,
yet confusing world of men.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.933
When I think of men, so many
questions come to mind.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.035
Questions like, Why?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.570
[all laugh]

03:23.570 --> 03:25.939
-For what?
-[laughs]

03:25.939 --> 03:28.208
I would love to go
to this DragCon panel.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.910
This would be so much fun,
you know what I mean?

03:29.910 --> 03:32.045
Like, I was, like,
she's enter-tainting.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.147
Yeah, like, as I was
listening to them,

03:34.147 --> 03:35.916
like, I really
wanted to love it.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.251
But it felt more like
a conversation

03:38.251 --> 03:42.089
rather than a panel
if we were at DragCon,

03:42.089 --> 03:45.425
and I didn't feel like
there was much content there.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.660
And I felt like with ours,

03:46.660 --> 03:49.196
I felt like you would have
learned some things.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.197
Mm-hmm.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.498
I want to make sure

03:51.498 --> 03:53.233
that my kids see me mess up,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.001
and that just because
you're an authority

03:55.001 --> 03:57.137
or a parent, you don't
have it all figured out.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.672
Because I'll never
have it figured out

03:58.672 --> 03:59.906
even until I die.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.209
So I think that's important
for kids to know.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.811
Because we make them
strive for perfection

04:04.811 --> 04:06.913
and make them think
that when they get older,

04:06.913 --> 04:07.914
it's all gonna be figured out,

04:07.914 --> 04:08.949
and that's
not really the case.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.016
At all.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.853
There's one thing
that stuck with me

04:12.853 --> 04:15.322
about RuPaul's
walk-throughs with us

04:15.322 --> 04:16.990
when she said,
"Once you let go

04:16.990 --> 04:19.659
"of expectation and worrying,

04:19.659 --> 04:21.828
it's so much easier
and more fun."

04:21.828 --> 04:23.630
Just like most
of the challenges,

04:23.630 --> 04:26.666
it gets more fun
when you're actually doing it.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.202
I think, like,
Ru's conversation with us

04:29.202 --> 04:31.972
made me re-shift everything
that I was going to talk about.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.641
Just be yourself,

04:34.641 --> 04:36.676
because that's
the most important thing.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.845
This is the time
to just let it all hang out.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.849
Like, I was initially
thinking about my dad

04:42.849 --> 04:45.385
and about
how I trained myself

04:45.385 --> 04:46.686
to be, like, careful.

04:46.686 --> 04:50.190
Growing up, my dad and I
weren't as close

04:50.190 --> 04:52.792
until someone in my family
passed away,

04:52.792 --> 04:55.395
and I think the wonderful thing
that came out of it

04:55.395 --> 04:58.532
was that we appreciated
the time that we have together.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.233
How do you think
your dad's gonna feel,

05:00.233 --> 05:02.836
like, about you
being on the show?

05:02.836 --> 05:05.205
Now? Really proud.

05:05.205 --> 05:10.577
He is, like, so incredibly
into it and supportive.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.347
But your parents are gonna be
proud of you, too, baby.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.216
I'm so excited.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.118
I thought you might
be in the top this week.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.986
Honestly, I did think

05:19.986 --> 05:22.122
that I could have
possibly been in the top.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.490
I don't know about winning,

05:23.490 --> 05:27.494
but the competition
is, like, so tough now.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.297
Like, The Daytona Winds
are spread.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.098
Don't you fart.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.500
Too late.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.036
But it is getting to that point

05:36.036 --> 05:37.837
where it's, like,
little slips, girl,

05:37.837 --> 05:39.005
and you're out.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.242
Do you feel like

05:42.242 --> 05:43.677
everyone's rooting
for each other?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.178
Do you feel like
it's all genuine?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.446
We are rooting
for each other.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.615
Like, in the moment,
of, like, "Oh, she did good.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.849
Oh, fuck."
You know what I mean?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.151
-Yeah.
-There's that.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.353
And I'm starting to feel that
with all the girls.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.021
I think that
the competition

05:55.021 --> 05:57.157
is getting very...

05:57.157 --> 05:58.458
Saucy?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.759
[laughs]

05:59.759 --> 06:02.229
The atmosphere just
definitely feels more tense.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.564
Like, at this point, I'm
just doing what I need to do.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.566
I'm not worried
about nobody else.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.435
I'm worried about Angeria,
and that's it.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.003
Who?

06:11.404 --> 06:13.273
-Sorry.
-Bitch.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.908
I don't wanna talk to you.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.510
RuPaul: Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.146
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

06:20.146 --> 06:23.049
the judges and I
will deliberate.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.051
You may leave the stage.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.955
Ladies, ladies.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.690
-Aah!
-Oh!

06:30.690 --> 06:32.025
Hot tea, honeybees.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.061
Jasmine, grab me
another drink.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.197
You want the bottom bitch
to grab you another drink?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.266
She's already there.
I can tell.

06:39.266 --> 06:43.703
Okay, I'm gonna be
very short and sweet.

06:43.703 --> 06:44.904
Girl--

06:44.904 --> 06:46.339
Because I gotta go get ready.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.009
Listen, I'm
in the bottom again.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.877
Yeah, but we still need
to hear from you, girl.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.146
It's very easy.
They loved my look.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.514
-Listen.
-No, no, no, wait.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.188
Come sit next to me,

07:02.188 --> 07:03.423
because you always
trying to run off.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.991
Okay, go ahead, Jasmine.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.861
Well, I'm in the bottom,
but at the same time,

07:07.861 --> 07:10.130
I feel like I had a very good
awareness in the group.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.666
So it's whatever.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.702
I will say
I'm in the bottom, too,

07:15.702 --> 07:18.705
and I'm so
fucking pissed right now.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.775
I'm more mad
at myself because...

07:23.043 --> 07:26.346
Girl, they always
tell me, like,

07:26.346 --> 07:28.748
whatever I do on the runway,
like, bring it to the challenge,

07:28.748 --> 07:30.650
and it just feels like
I haven't done that yet,

07:30.650 --> 07:32.085
and I try my hardest.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.923
It sucks.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.425
They expect so much from me,

07:38.425 --> 07:40.393
and it just feels like
I'm letting them down.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.295
-You're not.
-You're not, babycake.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.165
Growing up,
I didn't talk to nobody.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.335
Like, it was just
always so hard

07:48.335 --> 07:49.469
for me being myself

07:49.469 --> 07:51.705
because, like,
it just always never felt

07:51.705 --> 07:53.073
like I was good enough.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.176
You can see the fire
in Ru's eyes.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.111
She is obsessed with you.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.080
You're on her
health insurance plan literally.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.482
She's going to give you
an organ when this is all done.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.351
-Yeah.
-And she sees how good you are

08:04.351 --> 08:06.286
in everything that you do.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.221
And everybody else
can see how good you are

08:08.221 --> 08:10.824
with everything you do and
how much you're pushing yourself

08:10.824 --> 08:13.793
and putting yourself
outside of your box.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.562
And remember, nothing
on that runway was said

08:15.562 --> 08:17.297
to get under your skin.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.032
It was just
to simply help you.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.700
That's a great point, DeJa.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.936
I think that's really
important to think about.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.238
-Daya?
-Yeah, I feel good.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.272
I feel comfortable.
I think I'll be fine.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.374
Not to worry.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.641
Yeah, you'll be fine.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.244
I think they just had
to put someone down there.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.712
I will say,
I think our group

08:32.712 --> 08:35.215
was not as strong
as your group...

08:35.215 --> 08:37.283
-I agree.
-...in terms of reactions

08:37.283 --> 08:39.652
and being able to communicate
with the judges.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.955
So I completely understand.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.223
If they have to put me
in the bottom three,

08:43.223 --> 08:44.624
I understand why.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.692
I'm not delusional.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.328
Believe it or not.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.196
I know I keep saying, yeah,

08:50.196 --> 08:52.799
I fucking love this look.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.101
And, like,
the makeup was so good.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.303
These are a bunch of, like,
little boy pants cut up.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.173
No, but you look sickening.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.207
Like, you look cool.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.042
Like, bitch, you look like

09:03.042 --> 09:04.911
you were gonna, like,
go beat somebody up.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.546
-Yes.
-Well, thank y'all.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.047
Who's been messing
with my little sister?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.150
Willow, Willow. Willow.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.484
Willow, what about you, sis?

09:11.484 --> 09:15.555
I just--I got emotional
like, not during,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.223
but it kicks in later.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.725
I mean, the one
that was hardest

09:18.725 --> 09:20.593
that we chose was fatherhood,

09:20.593 --> 09:23.596
and I'm so happy
we ended up going with it

09:23.596 --> 09:26.999
because it's something
that I talk about a lot

09:26.999 --> 09:29.903
because I can make
dead dad jokes all day.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.304
Yeah.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.706
My dad died
of a sudden heart attack

09:33.706 --> 09:35.275
when I was 11 years old.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.778
And my relationship
with my dad was always rocky,

09:38.778 --> 09:41.147
and I didn't know why.

09:41.147 --> 09:44.717
What about me
is so distasteful?

09:44.717 --> 09:47.787
It's hard when you're,
like, saying it out loud.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.656
The emotions
just, like, get to you.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.524
And I was afraid, like, oh, no.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.892
Am I gonna, like,
break down out there

09:52.892 --> 09:54.427
and just, like,
sob on the stage?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.163
And I was happy that
I was able to, you know,

09:57.163 --> 09:58.364
keep my composure.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.367
I wanted to live life with him

10:01.367 --> 10:05.038
in a way that felt happy
and comfortable.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.540
But he had
his own inner demons,

10:07.540 --> 10:11.010
and that's not fair
to take that out on me.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.247
I know for me, it was, uh...

10:14.247 --> 10:16.583
You know,
like, I'm living proof

10:16.583 --> 10:19.686
that your parents
can accept you.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.155
With my dad, honestly,
I'm so proud of him

10:22.155 --> 10:23.590
and I'm so proud of it.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.026
Hey, baby.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.361
Aah!

10:28.361 --> 10:30.630
-How you doing out there?
-Aah!

10:30.630 --> 10:34.434
This was your dream,
and you made it.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.069
Baby, you made it.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.205
Now you got to do this thing

10:39.205 --> 10:41.207
and bring it on home.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.277
Hi, son. Just wanna say
I love you,

10:44.277 --> 10:46.813
and I always knew
you could do this.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.050
I've never been away
from my parents this long.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.020
Being away from my parents
at this point

10:54.020 --> 10:56.489
has been the hardest struggle
for me here.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.192
You always dreamed
of being on the RuPaul show,

10:59.192 --> 11:02.195
and you finally got
the dream to come true.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.931
Now I want you to go out there
and do your best

11:04.931 --> 11:06.266
and just be you

11:06.266 --> 11:10.003
and bring that crown home
to Sparta, Georgia.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.671
-Yes.
-Yes.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.173
Trying to stay focused
and, like, missing home

11:14.173 --> 11:17.810
is, like, the biggest battle.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.613
I needed this
to really get me through

11:20.613 --> 11:22.215
the rest of this competition.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.416
Mwah!

11:23.416 --> 11:26.252
Oh, my God.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.087
Angie!

11:28.087 --> 11:30.490
Oh-ho-ho, baby.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.393
How beautiful.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.094
[sharp exhales]

11:35.094 --> 11:38.197
Are you good, sis?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.568
Oh, my God. Uh...

11:43.269 --> 11:45.538
I've always been a daddy's boy,

11:45.538 --> 11:49.609
and today I'm probably
more close to them

11:49.609 --> 11:51.878
than I ever have been,
like, in my whole life,

11:51.878 --> 11:53.046
and that's saying a lot.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.682
I needed that.
I really needed that.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.985
Like, I really can't believe
I just saw that.

11:58.985 --> 12:02.155
Me and Angie's story
is, like, hella similar.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.223
Love overcame the fear,

12:04.223 --> 12:07.427
and that's exactly what happened
with me and my dad.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.661
When he comes to see a show,

12:08.661 --> 12:10.463
he always goes, like,
"That's my boy."

12:10.463 --> 12:13.066
I'm freaking out.
I really am, because...

12:16.269 --> 12:18.071
Like, having their support

12:18.071 --> 12:20.607
means, like, the world to me.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.208
You're really lucky.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.409
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.278
-You're really lucky.
-You're really lucky.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.348
My dad had never seen me
perform in drag

12:28.348 --> 12:30.116
before he passed away.

12:30.116 --> 12:33.219
I never really had a
conversation with him about it,

12:33.219 --> 12:34.954
which is actually
really upsetting

12:34.954 --> 12:37.190
now that I think about it.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.159
I'm just, honestly,
like, so blessed,

12:40.159 --> 12:42.161
and I'm just so happy.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.999
I do wanna make sure,
that, like, DeJa's moment--

12:45.999 --> 12:47.467
-Yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.336
They not only, like,
loved her in the panel,

12:50.336 --> 12:54.507
they were so fully invested
and in love with her look.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.576
They, like, gushed
over my look.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.412
It literally tickled exactly
what they wanted to see.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.913
I wanna say this to you.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.851
Like, as moderators,
y'all were fucking amazing.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.186
Because the moderator

13:07.186 --> 13:09.322
was honestly
a big responsibility,

13:09.322 --> 13:11.124
because you had
to keep us ho's together.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.925
And the thing is, like, Bosco,

13:12.925 --> 13:14.661
immediately when
you started talking,

13:14.661 --> 13:16.295
I was, like, goddamn, bitch.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.797
I feel like
I'm watching a talk show.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.433
If this was a DragCon moment,
I would love to be there

13:20.433 --> 13:21.467
and just watch it,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.302
and just watch you talk
for hours.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.504
And I will say
thank you so much

13:24.504 --> 13:25.772
for bringing that out of me.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.708
Like, I was not comfortable,
like, talking about it,

13:28.708 --> 13:30.476
because I don't want
to bring my dad down.

13:30.476 --> 13:34.013
But, like,
it was bad at one point.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.582
I forgot about all the bad

13:36.582 --> 13:38.017
and just thought about the good.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.187
And I really needed
to think about the bad

13:41.187 --> 13:43.022
to appreciate what we have now.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.091
And thank you so much for
bringing that out of me, Bosco.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.093
Like, I really appreciate you

13:47.093 --> 13:49.395
because, girl,
I was, like, really hesitant

13:49.395 --> 13:51.497
on, like, talking about it.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.999
But you made me feel
so comfortable enough

13:53.999 --> 13:55.101
to talk about it.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.436
You told me that your dad

13:56.436 --> 13:57.970
is, like, a really big fan
of your drag.

13:57.970 --> 14:01.040
Has he always been so supportive
of your feminine side?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.409
My dad really tried
to suppress that.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.244
It was all out of fear.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.679
I just wanna say I love you,

14:06.679 --> 14:09.048
and you did
such an amazing job.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.550
I'm so glad you were
the moderator and not me.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.684
Holy fuck.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.419
Because that would have
gone downhill so quick.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.822
[all laugh]

14:15.822 --> 14:17.056
But, like,
one of, like, my goals

14:17.056 --> 14:20.226
is to, like, make Ru laugh
as much as possible.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.329
And, like, that will
make me feel so good.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.364
Hi-ee.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.367
[cheering and screaming]

14:28.367 --> 14:30.636
Oh, my God.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.773
My butt is so big,
I might fall right off of this.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.575
Okay. Imagine?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.410
[all laugh]

14:37.410 --> 14:38.978
You guys did
so good today. Truly.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.646
What a dream.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.615
I love you.
Oh, my God.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.083
You two have just
been back here.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.219
Yeah, we've just been
back here talking.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.220
-Doing what?
-Kiki the kaikai.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.621
And talking shit
about them.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.124
Okay, so who's the bitch?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.191
Hmm?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.260
_Jasmine.
-Jasmine.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.729
I'm the talkative bitch.
That's all.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.897
I just talk a lot.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.367
Blah blah blah blah...
[all laugh]

15:01.367 --> 15:03.102
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.105
So who went home that we hate?

15:07.206 --> 15:08.574
All right.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.842
We were all actually
thinking about it.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.410
We're like...

15:11.410 --> 15:13.146
How does it feel to be back?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.481
Because I know that
last season you were a regular.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.083
I was only on two episodes,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.851
but a lot of people were, like,

15:18.851 --> 15:20.720
I feel like
I keep seeing you.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.255
I'm, like, that's Loni Love.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.158
[all laugh]

15:25.158 --> 15:27.827
This woman was looking at
a picture of Loni Love,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.428
looks at me, and goes, Loni?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.631
[all laugh]
No!

15:31.631 --> 15:34.267
But, yeah, it feels like
really fucking cool to be back.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.802
-Yay.
-It's nice.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.303
You look amazing.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.172
Thank you.
I tried so hard.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.840
[all laugh]

15:40.840 --> 15:43.376
Oh, my God, I just want
to say something to you please.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.544
What?

15:44.544 --> 15:47.713
Me and my best friend,
like, live for you.

15:47.713 --> 15:48.848
Thank you.

15:48.848 --> 15:49.949
I would have been
in the bottom tonight

15:49.949 --> 15:52.485
just to get
a critique from you.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.886
[all laugh]

15:53.886 --> 15:56.923
I have to say, I have been
working in a ramen restaurant

15:56.923 --> 15:58.391
for the last, like, two years,

15:58.391 --> 16:00.726
and every morning when I open
and I'm mopping,

16:00.726 --> 16:02.094
I'm listening to your podcast.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.698
And I would just, like,
dream of getting on Drag Race

16:05.698 --> 16:06.766
and talk to you.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.734
And now that
it's, like, real,

16:08.734 --> 16:10.703
I'm just, like, so happy.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.505
I love you so fucking much.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.840
Oh, my God, thank you.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.074
I wish I could hug you,

16:15.074 --> 16:17.910
but there was
a global pandemic.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.512
Air hug.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.814
Oh, boy, I really love this.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.482
What do you have
to say to me that's nice?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.818
[all laugh]

16:25.818 --> 16:27.320
Your hair is incredible.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.788
Thank you. Okay.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.022
[all laugh]

16:30.022 --> 16:31.257
[coughs]

16:31.257 --> 16:32.725
Corona virus.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.727
[all laugh]
Oh, my God.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.295
Ladies, five minutes.
Five minutes.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.164
Oh, do I have to leave?

16:38.164 --> 16:41.200
I coughed,
and they're, like, wah!

16:41.200 --> 16:42.468
[all laugh]

16:42.468 --> 16:43.469
Thank you.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.705
-Bye.
-See you soon.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.707
I'm just gonna prepare
for this fucking lip sync.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.343
Y'all finally gonna get
our lip sync together, girl.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.777
[laughs]

16:55.715 --> 16:58.017
I am very much
in it to win it,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.886
because Jorgeous
is my biggest competition

16:59.886 --> 17:02.121
when it comes to lip syncing.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.825
I do not want to falter
behind her.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.829
I want them to be, like,
we don't know what to do.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.465
I'm gonna give everything

17:12.465 --> 17:15.768
because I wanna be here
till the end for my people.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.236
My friends, my family,

17:17.236 --> 17:19.305
my mom, my dad, my brother.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.341
I am definitely
in the mental zone

17:22.341 --> 17:23.376
of winning this.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.444
I'm sorry, Jorgeous.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.747
You're going home.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.149
I really wanna stay.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.952
I still have so much to prove,
so much to show.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.253
I'll be damned if a bitch

17:34.253 --> 17:36.289
is gonna send me home
in a lip sync.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.491
I cannot believe this.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.992
Yeah, no. [laughs]

17:39.992 --> 17:41.460
I cannot believe this shit.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.862
As I'm listening to this song,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.130
I'm, like, what the fuck?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.532
Ladies, time
for the main stage.

17:46.532 --> 17:47.533
Come on out.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.935
Oh, fuck, already? Damn,

17:48.935 --> 17:50.036
-Damn.
-Oh, God.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.070
Get your shit.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.605
Did you get to meet the baby?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.407
Mmm. Mwah.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.509
I'm gonna give 'em a show.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.311
Mm-mmm.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.279
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.181
I've made some decisions.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.083
RuPaul: Jorgeous.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.751
Jasmine.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.320
The time has come...

18:07.320 --> 18:09.789
for you to lip sync...

18:09.789 --> 18:13.492
for your life!

18:14.660 --> 18:16.796
Jasmine.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.432
Jorgeous.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.133
Shantay you both stay.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.135
Yes!

18:23.135 --> 18:25.771
Holy fuck, bitch.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.306
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.213
I love you.
I'm so happy.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.549
Mmm. [laughs]

18:38.217 --> 18:39.885
It makes me feel happy,

18:39.885 --> 18:43.889
because I did not want
to stop Jorgeous' road.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.791
[laughs]

18:45.791 --> 18:47.460
Whew.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.496
And I would have felt,
you know, even worse

18:50.496 --> 18:53.199
if I sent her home,
because she's my little sister.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.735
Oh, fuck.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.138
Oh, my God, thank the Lord.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.407
Who would have thought
that me and Jasmine

19:01.407 --> 19:03.776
would have been both safe?

19:03.776 --> 19:05.544
I didn't see
what Jasmine was doing,

19:05.544 --> 19:06.946
but I knew that bitch
was turning it out,

19:06.946 --> 19:10.516
and I knew my ass
was turning it out.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.685
When she said my name first,

19:12.685 --> 19:14.186
I was flabbergasted

19:14.186 --> 19:16.555
because I thought
I had just sent home Jorgeous.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.425
But then when she said
you're both staying,

19:19.425 --> 19:22.361
like, fuck,
like, holy fuck, we did it.
