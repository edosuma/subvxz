02:28.765 --> 02:29.765
Excuse me!

02:31.320 --> 02:33.909
Excuse me, have you been following me?

02:33.910 --> 02:35.489
Following you? No.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.969
I saw you taking pictures of me.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.429
I'm a street photographer.

02:38.430 --> 02:41.375
I take pictures of everyone.
I've seen you before.

02:41.376 --> 02:43.889
I've seen you three times
in the last couple of weeks.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.909
Well, I don't know.

02:45.910 --> 02:48.566
I'm in the city often but
maybe you just saw someone

02:48.567 --> 02:51.709
who looks like me?
Let me see those photos.

02:51.710 --> 02:53.573
I'll show you the one of you.

02:55.568 --> 02:57.309
Oh my god, how many have you taken?

02:57.310 --> 03:00.089
Delete those right now.
Just a few.

03:00.090 --> 03:02.869
A few?
You were an interesting...

03:02.870 --> 03:05.531
This is a public space, it's
my legal right to take photos.

03:05.532 --> 03:07.482
I want you to delete those right now.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.697
I'll call the police!

04:31.103 --> 04:35.542
January 19, 2015, 8:45 AM.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.659
I have been discovered.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.529
This will be my last attempt.

04:38.530 --> 04:40.653
Subject is more reactionary than expected

04:40.654 --> 04:42.904
and does not take well
to being photographed.

05:16.930 --> 05:19.699
Gwen I think that shelf's
had enough organizing for now.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.619
You've barely spoken
to a customer all day.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.779
Sorry.
No need for apologies.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.119
Just keep an eye out.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.249
That customer has been hovering
around the horror section

05:28.250 --> 05:30.400
for ages, why don't
you go give him a hand?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.569
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

05:34.570 --> 05:35.870
Don't get distracted Gwen.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.999
Hello, can I help you with anything?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.349
Hi, yeah, um,

05:56.350 --> 06:01.149
well I'm after a really dark,
creepy, scary horror movie.

06:01.150 --> 06:02.329
I'm trying to show my partner something

06:02.330 --> 06:04.009
to really freak with his head

06:04.010 --> 06:06.563
but he's not scared by anything.

06:07.900 --> 06:08.733
Has he seen a lot of horror films?

06:08.734 --> 06:10.329
Yeah, yeah.

06:10.330 --> 06:13.606
He's actually a bit of a
horror movie Afficiando.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.629
More than me anyway.

06:15.630 --> 06:18.199
So, he's familiar with the classics?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.801
The Shining, The Thing?
Yeah, yeah.

06:20.802 --> 06:23.979
I think he's seen those, yeah.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.633
Well there are a few
others you could try.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.009
Possession's a very good
one, it doesn't seem

06:30.010 --> 06:31.310
to be too well known here.

06:33.090 --> 06:34.363
It's by Andrzej Zulawski.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.463
He's a Polish director, he's very good.

06:39.390 --> 06:41.693
One of his films was
actually banned in Poland.

06:41.694 --> 06:42.699
Oh, well that gives me a good idea

06:42.700 --> 06:45.449
about how scary he is.
That one wasn't that good.

06:45.450 --> 06:48.387
Oh?
Possession's good though.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.493
It's very graphic but also
really dramatic and out there.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.273
Mm.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.023
I thought it worked.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.269
It is a very interesting
film, psychologically.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.971
There's a few others.
Ah, no, no.

07:04.972 --> 07:07.829
That one's great, thanks, thank you.

07:07.830 --> 07:10.829
You've seen a lot of movies, obviously?

07:10.830 --> 07:13.839
I work in a video store,
don't you think I should know

07:13.840 --> 07:17.249
a lot about them?
Well yeah, sure, definitely.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.039
So great, thanks, you've
helped a lot, thank you.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.943
Cheers, I'll catch ya later.

08:19.509 --> 08:20.759
Hi.
Oh, hey.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.873
What's your name?
Gwen.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.279
This is gonna sound a bit forward but,

08:27.280 --> 08:29.129
I find you very attractive
and I was wondering

08:29.130 --> 08:31.744
if you wanted to come back to my place?

08:31.745 --> 08:34.216
Um.

08:34.217 --> 08:37.149
Aren't you supposed to get
to know me a little better

08:37.150 --> 08:39.179
before you ask something like that?

08:39.181 --> 08:40.182
I understand it's abrupt.

08:40.183 --> 08:42.123
I just prefer to keep things simple.

08:43.669 --> 08:45.579
I understand if you don't want to

08:45.580 --> 08:48.519
but here's my phone number
in case you change your mind.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.820
I live just down the road.

09:07.570 --> 09:08.403
Hello?

09:10.320 --> 09:11.370
Yeah no, that's fine.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.730
I'm definitely still interested.

09:16.010 --> 09:18.273
I'm at my place if you
wouldn't mind coming here.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.730
Okay, see ya soon.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.783
Hey, god morning.
Hey.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.919
That was nice last night.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.669
Does that usually work?

09:46.670 --> 09:48.370
Asking guys straight up like that?

09:49.230 --> 09:51.583
Sometimes, not always.

09:53.110 --> 09:56.159
Hm, is that it though?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.539
Was it just the one night you wanted?

09:58.540 --> 10:01.379
Yeah.
That's too bad.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.619
Well, okay, one night.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.949
I get it but how about some conversation?

10:06.950 --> 10:09.549
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

10:09.550 --> 10:13.313
There's not much to say.
I can't believe that.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.319
Everyone has something
to say about themselves.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.920
You a nymphomaniac or something?

10:19.777 --> 10:22.103
You just have sex with
no emotion attached?

10:23.350 --> 10:27.099
I'm not judging, I'm just curious.

10:27.100 --> 10:27.933
No.

10:29.382 --> 10:33.129
Then why so distant?
Just not really looking

10:33.130 --> 10:35.113
to get involved with anyone.

10:35.114 --> 10:36.763
I just had a bad day yesterday.

10:38.650 --> 10:41.217
I guess you want me to clear out then?

10:41.218 --> 10:43.869
If you wouldn't mind.
Okay, no problem.

10:43.870 --> 10:48.269
Well, it was nice sleeping with you

10:48.270 --> 10:52.209
and kind of meeting you.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.043
Gwen.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.759
Subject first sighted on a train

11:02.760 --> 11:05.889
heading north on the Butler
line from Perth station.

11:05.890 --> 11:09.939
About 175 centimeters tall,
brown medium curly hair

11:09.940 --> 11:11.543
with a goatee and brown eyes.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.099
He was wearing a red and
white tartan button shirt

11:15.100 --> 11:16.033
and tan trousers.

11:16.890 --> 11:18.469
What caught my eye was that we didn't seem

11:18.470 --> 11:21.459
to have anything in his pockets,
they were completely flat,

11:21.460 --> 11:23.629
besides the outline of a card.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.829
Seemed to be looking
around at other passengers

11:25.830 --> 11:30.183
and looked slightly restless.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.650
Hey weird girl.

13:38.790 --> 13:41.540
Where do you go all the time
with those heavy bags, eh?

19:59.105 --> 19:59.938
Hey.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.468
How are ya?
Good, thanks.

20:01.469 --> 20:02.719
Just the usual?

20:03.683 --> 20:06.210
You know what, I'll
have a blueberry today.

20:06.211 --> 20:08.839
Okay, that
will be seven dollars.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.483
Sit table as usual?
Yeah.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.819
How's everything going?
Oh yeah, pretty good.

20:14.820 --> 20:17.509
Is Jan in today?
No, she's on holiday.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.023
Down someplace near Mandurah.

20:21.181 --> 20:23.467
Forget what it's called.
Oh, Pinjarra?

20:23.468 --> 20:25.653
That's it, yes, yeah, yeah.
Yeah? Ah.

20:25.654 --> 20:26.487
That's a good place.

20:26.488 --> 20:28.711
I've been down there a few times actually.

20:28.712 --> 20:31.082
I've got an old friend
that lives there now.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.179
Doesn't matter I guess, I was just hoping

20:33.180 --> 20:35.749
to talk to her about
that painting she wanted.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.390
Okay, I can pass
on a message if you'd like?

20:37.391 --> 20:39.374
Yeah, actually that would be great.

20:39.375 --> 20:43.779
I've got some designs
here I think she'll like.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.829
Just pass that on to her.
Yeah, sure, yeah.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.806
Tell her to
give me a call, yeah.

20:48.807 --> 20:50.899
Here's your muffin,
coffee won't be a minute.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.663
Thank you very much, sir.

21:45.150 --> 21:46.812
Hi, um, sorry, I've
just got to let you know

21:46.813 --> 21:48.843
that the newspapers are one dollar each.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.379
Sorry.
Thanks.

21:56.380 --> 21:57.696
Anything else I can help you with?

21:57.697 --> 22:00.613
No, no thanks.
Thanks, have a nice day.

22:44.030 --> 22:44.863
Excuse me.

22:47.570 --> 22:49.699
Um, could you help me?

22:49.700 --> 22:50.934
I'm looking for a movie,

22:50.935 --> 22:53.559
it's called Stranger on the Third Floor?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.253
No sorry, we don't have that.

22:56.382 --> 22:57.280
Are you sure?

22:57.281 --> 22:59.486
I mean can you check
on the computer for me?

22:59.487 --> 23:00.649
I know we don't have it.

23:00.650 --> 23:04.199
I've looked for it before.
Hm, well that's too bad.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.939
Do you have any good noir recommendations?

23:06.940 --> 23:09.589
Maybe, have you tried Touch of Evil?

23:09.590 --> 23:11.749
Yes, yes, Orson Wells.

23:11.750 --> 23:12.800
That is a good movie.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.130
Well perhaps...

23:19.620 --> 23:23.009
Have I seen you somewhere before?

23:23.010 --> 23:24.160
No, I don't think so.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.369
Do you come here often?
No, no.

23:27.370 --> 23:31.219
The one near me closed
down, very disappointing.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.220
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.

23:34.390 --> 23:35.393
At a coffee shop?

23:36.350 --> 23:37.759
About a week ago?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.485
That's it, unless I'm mistaken?

23:40.486 --> 23:44.889
I don't know, I like to
try different coffee places.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.399
The one on Charles Avenue.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.233
You'd remember it.

23:47.234 --> 23:48.919
It's got this vintage
furniture everywhere.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.089
It's a really cool place.
I don't remember that.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.739
Maybe it was someone with a similar face?

23:54.740 --> 23:56.319
No, I'm sure it was you.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.719
Hair done differently?
Well

23:58.720 --> 24:00.620
I don't really do my hair up much, so?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.753
Anyway, I should really get back to work.

24:05.248 --> 24:07.959
You might want to try The
Postman Always Rings Twice,

24:07.960 --> 24:09.913
The Stranger, Double Endemnity.

24:12.810 --> 24:13.643
Look, wait.

24:15.860 --> 24:18.519
Sorry for trying to pin
you down back there.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.779
I don't know, you've got some sort

24:19.780 --> 24:21.633
of interesting look about you.

24:22.490 --> 24:24.819
Maybe I've seen you before,
maybe I haven't, I don't know.

24:24.820 --> 24:27.959
I get these kind of things
mixed up all the time.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.879
But there is something interesting
about you, all the same.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.730
If that doesn't should too hackneyed.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.369
Anyway, I don't want to bother you

24:35.370 --> 24:38.019
but I just always considered it a travesty

24:38.020 --> 24:39.614
to waste an opportunity when something

24:39.615 --> 24:42.529
just feels like you should do it.

24:42.530 --> 24:45.613
So I guess what I'm trying to say is,

24:46.811 --> 24:50.453
would you like to go
get a coffee sometime?

24:51.500 --> 24:52.333
Maybe next week?

24:55.110 --> 24:57.729
How 'bout I leave you my number?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.253
And you can think it over?

25:01.710 --> 25:02.543
Okay.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.979
Hello, this is Joseph.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.449
If you leave a message at the
tone, I'll get back to you

26:00.450 --> 26:03.529
whenever I feel like it.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.423
Hello? This is Gwen.

26:07.210 --> 26:09.110
I'd like to have lunch like you asked.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.360
Call me back when you can.

26:20.965 --> 26:22.599
Get out, just get out!

26:22.600 --> 26:23.859
Sweating my ass off here
and all you're doing

26:23.860 --> 26:28.359
is lying on the fucking couch.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.479
Come back when you get a job.
This is my place,

26:31.480 --> 26:33.143
just as much as it is yours.

26:33.144 --> 26:34.689
If you don't want to talk to me,

26:34.690 --> 26:36.559
then you can go stay somewhere else.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.009
When you start paying
for the rent, honey,

26:39.010 --> 26:40.629
that's when this place becomes yours

26:40.630 --> 26:41.989
as well as mine.
Fine.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.649
I'll spend the night at Joey's alright?

26:43.650 --> 26:44.483
You can come over when you're done

26:44.484 --> 26:47.084
being a fucking bitch.
Fuck off.

27:03.860 --> 27:04.693
Hey!

27:06.970 --> 27:10.919
Glad you decided to come.
It's okay, it's a nice day.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.773
It's beautiful.

27:13.010 --> 27:16.229
I know it's not really a fancy
place to take someone out

27:16.230 --> 27:18.609
but who needs fancy, really?

27:18.610 --> 27:21.743
Unless you normally expect
something more on the first date?

27:22.620 --> 27:24.279
I've never been on a date before,

27:24.280 --> 27:26.999
so I don't really have
anything to compare it to.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.449
Yeah right.
It's true.

27:29.450 --> 27:30.689
Really?

27:30.690 --> 27:33.809
I mean without sounding too shallow,

27:33.810 --> 27:35.013
you're a pretty girl, I'd be surprised

27:35.014 --> 27:36.814
if you hadn't been asked out before.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.279
Drunk men and guys on the street

27:40.280 --> 27:44.239
have hit on me a few times but
I wasn't really interested.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.019
They were usually pretty crude.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.259
So why me then?

27:47.260 --> 27:49.898
Just the first guy that wasn't drunk.

27:49.899 --> 27:53.323
You seemed interesting.
Hey, that's my reason.

27:53.324 --> 27:56.369
Or maybe that's just my cover up

27:56.370 --> 27:58.523
for being just as shallow as those guys.

27:58.524 --> 27:59.639
I don't think you're shallow.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.789
Well, I appreciate that.

28:01.790 --> 28:03.539
But how can you be so sure?

28:03.540 --> 28:05.769
You don't know me.
Neither of us can be sure

28:05.770 --> 28:08.453
of anything about the
other, we only just met.

28:09.700 --> 28:10.533
Very true.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.799
I suppose I shouldn't be so sexist.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.100
You could be shallow, too.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.157
So, uh, what do you think you'll get?

28:26.120 --> 28:28.149
I think I'll have the Carbonara today.

28:28.150 --> 28:31.333
Hm, I think I'll just have a burger.

28:46.548 --> 28:48.919
So what do you do for a living?

28:48.920 --> 28:49.820
Are you a painter?

28:51.150 --> 28:52.120
How the hell did you figure that out?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.243
You have paint on your hands.

28:55.077 --> 28:55.910
So I do.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.629
Yeah, I do paintings for commission.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.509
Try and sell my other stuff at the markets

29:01.510 --> 29:05.749
but it's not really a way
to make a living these days

29:05.750 --> 29:09.569
so I'm studying in the city, aged care

29:09.570 --> 29:12.373
which is, it's okay, I guess.

29:13.688 --> 29:15.959
It's not that I dislike old people,

29:15.960 --> 29:18.079
it's just they can be a pain sometimes,

29:18.080 --> 29:20.592
if you know what I mean?

29:20.593 --> 29:23.210
It's not really where my passion lies.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.589
But it's a job that helps people

29:26.590 --> 29:29.739
with nowhere else to go
so I can deal with it

29:29.740 --> 29:32.099
not being my first choice of work.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.616
So you need a back up career?

29:34.617 --> 29:37.399
Why can't you make a living?
Basically?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.769
Market saturation and the fact is,

29:39.770 --> 29:42.289
there barely is a market anymore.

29:42.290 --> 29:44.219
People don't want to pay for handmade art

29:44.220 --> 29:47.229
when they can replicate things so easy.

29:47.230 --> 29:48.930
Photos do the job for most people.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.253
Everything is there just
at a touch of a button.

29:56.970 --> 29:59.129
You know, I found it strange

29:59.130 --> 30:01.100
when you gave me your phone number.

30:01.101 --> 30:03.899
It was a home phone number, not a mobile.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.513
Why is that?
Yeah.

30:07.220 --> 30:09.029
I should probably explain.

30:09.030 --> 30:10.679
A lot of people do get bothered by this

30:10.680 --> 30:14.483
but I'm what you might
like to call a technophobe.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.053
Or a ludite, which isn't
anything that crazy

30:18.054 --> 30:23.054
but I just don't like the
whole modern tech deal.

30:24.599 --> 30:27.184
I still listen to CDs and I have a TV

30:27.185 --> 30:31.233
but don't carry a phone and
I don't have a computer.

30:32.170 --> 30:34.723
It's all just too much noise to me.

30:35.570 --> 30:37.059
I mean I used to feel that need

30:37.060 --> 30:39.719
to know what everyone's up to 24/7

30:39.720 --> 30:42.123
and it used to,

30:43.490 --> 30:45.193
make me go crazy but,

30:46.060 --> 30:48.083
one day I just forgot it.

30:50.145 --> 30:51.513
And never looked back.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.895
My friends think it's a bit annoying

30:54.896 --> 30:58.111
but people lasted most of human history

30:58.112 --> 31:01.009
without having to send 10,000 texts a day

31:01.010 --> 31:04.633
or having to check their
MySpace constantly.

31:05.806 --> 31:07.676
But how do you stay organized?

31:07.677 --> 31:10.094
Make appointments and things?

31:11.510 --> 31:12.589
It's not hard.

31:12.590 --> 31:14.802
I write the important stuff down.

31:14.803 --> 31:16.909
I make most appointments over the phone

31:16.910 --> 31:20.223
and all the other stuff I just
keep up here in my noggin.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.089
Sort of frees up my mind
to think about other,

31:24.090 --> 31:26.317
more interesting things and I don't know,

31:26.318 --> 31:27.963
I feel like I have more privacy.

31:29.370 --> 31:31.383
Doesn't bother you, does it?
No.

31:33.807 --> 31:37.263
But you disagree?
I like to stay informed.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.939
You're a curious person, I can tell.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.953
Your friends don't like
that you're a technophobe?

31:43.954 --> 31:47.429
No, I mean, they think it's a bit dumb

31:47.430 --> 31:49.326
but it works for me

31:49.327 --> 31:52.059
and they have their own
weird little quirks too.

31:52.060 --> 31:54.119
I'm sure your friends do, too.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.599
Do you have any weird friends?

31:55.600 --> 31:57.410
I mean I don't mean to
say that in a bad way.

31:57.411 --> 31:59.063
I kind of like weird people.

32:01.010 --> 32:03.719
I don't, I don't know.

32:03.720 --> 32:08.389
I don't really have any.
What? No friends?

32:08.390 --> 32:09.223
No.

32:11.112 --> 32:15.009
Is that by choice or just bad luck?

32:15.010 --> 32:15.843
I don't know.

32:16.890 --> 32:18.823
Just not really good with people.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.649
Well you decided to come here today.

32:24.650 --> 32:29.070
I don't know, just trying
something new I suppose.

32:30.585 --> 32:32.399
How do you normally spend your time?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.176
I don't know.

32:35.437 --> 32:37.903
You say that a lot.
I guess,

32:38.975 --> 32:40.726
I just don't really know what to tell you.

32:40.727 --> 32:42.677
There's not a lot interesting about me.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.253
Okay, um.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.609
You know I'm here 'cause
I'm interested in you

32:49.610 --> 32:53.970
but it seems to me like you
don't really want to talk to me

32:53.971 --> 32:56.699
and that's okay, I mean,

32:56.700 --> 32:58.299
if you don't then just say.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.500
I don't want you to be
here just as a favor.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.239
It's okay, really, I mean sometimes

33:03.240 --> 33:06.434
you go out on a limb just based on a vibe.

33:06.435 --> 33:08.623
It's not always gonna work out.

33:10.857 --> 33:12.248
No!

33:12.249 --> 33:15.939
I want to get to know you.
Well yeah, I mean,

33:15.940 --> 33:16.940
I want to get to know you, too,

33:16.941 --> 33:19.737
but the conversation
can't just go one way.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.133
Well, I guess,

33:25.620 --> 33:29.539
I like to study a lot, just
anything I find interesting.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.740
And I like films.
Ah.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.809
That's why you work at a video store.

33:33.810 --> 33:36.189
Actually, I started
really getting interested

33:36.190 --> 33:38.289
after I started working there,

33:38.290 --> 33:41.059
just as a way to make sure I
knew what to say to customers.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.549
I'd watch as many of the films as I could

33:42.550 --> 33:46.289
and well, I guess I kind
of just got obsessed.

33:46.290 --> 33:49.470
You like films, too?
Yes, I love 'em.

33:49.471 --> 33:51.049
I mean, I've loved 'em since I was a kid.

33:51.050 --> 33:54.089
I've got a whole lot at home
but it still doesn't compare

33:54.090 --> 33:57.030
to going to a real cinema.
No, it doesn't.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.609
See, this is better, isn't it?

34:00.610 --> 34:03.093
I mean, we're really talking.
Yeah.

34:10.693 --> 34:12.589
I've been listening to a new band lately,

34:12.590 --> 34:15.139
called The Flaming Lips,
have you heard of them?

34:15.139 --> 34:15.973
Heard of them?

34:15.974 --> 34:18.188
That's one of my favorite
bands from the 90's.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.399
I've got all their albums.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.159
What's your favorite song of theirs?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.699
I don't know.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.150
I like a lot of them, really.

34:26.060 --> 34:27.739
What other bands do you like?

34:27.739 --> 34:30.129
Do you like a lot of
alternative rock like that?

34:30.130 --> 34:32.359
Well I do like that kind of music.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.969
But I'm really into jazz and classical.

34:35.969 --> 34:40.668
Like Louis Armstrong, Ray
Charles, Ella Fitzgerald,

34:40.670 --> 34:41.993
just some of my favorites.

34:42.850 --> 34:45.159
God, do I sound enough like a hipster yet?

34:45.159 --> 34:46.728
I do have a partial excuse, though.

34:46.730 --> 34:49.193
My father, he used to direct an orchestra.

34:50.068 --> 34:52.563
No, I like that kind of music, too.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.679
Do you ever wonder about people?

34:56.679 --> 35:01.364
When you see 'em from afar?
All the time, why?

35:01.365 --> 35:04.763
Just, those two people
over there by the bench,

35:06.650 --> 35:08.089
sometimes I just wonder
about their connections

35:08.090 --> 35:10.590
like how they know each
other, that sort of thing.

35:12.190 --> 35:13.023
She's his mum.

35:14.730 --> 35:18.199
He looks bored so he must
be there out of obligation.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.529
He keeps playing with his watch.

35:20.530 --> 35:22.059
She's got something big in the bag,

35:22.060 --> 35:23.189
it might be his birthday soon.

35:23.190 --> 35:26.249
Huh, nice.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.289
Could be completely wrong, though.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.499
Makes you want to know more, doesn't it?

35:30.500 --> 35:31.413
Yeah I guess.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.781
How was your lunch?
Yeah, it was good.

35:36.428 --> 35:39.049
Yeah, it's
a good place isn't it?

35:39.050 --> 35:40.829
Yeah, it's nice.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.107
Peaceful, actually.

35:44.750 --> 35:47.902
So relaxing isn't it,
walking on the surf?

35:47.903 --> 35:49.633
Feet slowly sinking into the sand?

35:57.500 --> 36:00.493
I'm having a really nice time.

36:02.045 --> 36:03.083
Do you want to kiss?

36:05.820 --> 36:06.653
I'd like that.

36:31.531 --> 36:35.031
Will I be seeing you again?
I think so.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.052
Hello?
Hey Gwen, it's Joseph.

41:03.053 --> 41:05.639
How ya been?
I'm okay.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.100
Have you been up to much?

41:09.780 --> 41:12.109
I checked out the music you mentioned.

41:12.110 --> 41:15.249
I love jazz, I've never
heard of Louis Armstrong.

41:15.250 --> 41:17.049
I'm glad you mentioned him, he's good.

41:17.050 --> 41:18.769
Haven't heard of him?

41:18.770 --> 41:21.839
Have you been living
under a rock?

41:21.840 --> 41:23.879
Anyway, I'm not doing anything tomorrow.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.969
Do you wanna go do something?
That'd be really nice.

41:26.970 --> 41:28.549
Wonderful.

41:28.550 --> 41:30.239
Well we've already been
to somewhere charming,

41:30.240 --> 41:31.709
how would you like to go to somewhere

41:31.710 --> 41:33.660
that appeals to your intellectual side?

41:35.260 --> 41:37.709
Actually, I think it'd be really nice

41:37.710 --> 41:41.219
to see where you live.
Um.

41:41.220 --> 41:44.719
Yeah, I guess I'm a bit traditional.

41:44.720 --> 41:45.813
Normally I just wait til...
Why?

41:45.814 --> 41:48.564
Is there something you
don't want me to see?

41:48.565 --> 41:50.232
No, what?

41:51.350 --> 41:54.069
Um, nothing.

41:54.070 --> 41:55.773
I didn't know that wasn't normal.

41:57.647 --> 41:59.999
I won't be judgmental or anything.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.109
I just it'd really interesting
to see where you live.

42:03.110 --> 42:05.051
Oh, right.

42:05.052 --> 42:07.818
I thought you meant something else.

42:07.819 --> 42:11.009
Nevermind.
That's okay.

42:11.010 --> 42:13.329
Maybe after we can go and see a museum?

42:13.330 --> 42:16.059
I hear

42:16.060 --> 42:18.879
there's a railway museum in Bassendean.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.599
That's something I'd be interested in.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.589
Oh, fantastic.

42:22.590 --> 42:24.389
As a kid I used be obsessed with trains.

42:24.390 --> 42:26.659
I've still got a lot of books of them.

42:26.660 --> 42:28.908
Um, well, I think it'd be lovely

42:28.909 --> 42:31.079
for you to come over and see my place.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.433
So long as I get to see yours sometime.

42:35.209 --> 42:38.689
There's not much to see.
Oh, well if you say so.

42:38.690 --> 42:42.839
So tomorrow's good for you?
Yeah.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.276
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

43:10.073 --> 43:10.906
Oh.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.105
Greetings.

43:29.281 --> 43:31.785
Welcome to Casa de la Leibovitz.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.499
I hope I'm not early.
No, no, right on time.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.333
Come in.

43:39.190 --> 43:42.433
So, is it how you imagined?

43:45.270 --> 43:47.946
Somewhat.
You arrived just about

43:47.947 --> 43:51.849
perfectly on time, I've baked cookies.

43:51.850 --> 43:53.017
That's nice of you.

43:55.991 --> 43:59.809
Did I tell you I cooked?
You might have mentioned it.

43:59.810 --> 44:02.859
Yeah well I used to
cook a lot for my ex.

44:02.860 --> 44:05.019
Not that cookies are
particularly hard to bake,

44:05.020 --> 44:06.619
anyone can do that.

44:06.620 --> 44:08.319
How about yourself, do you cook?

44:08.320 --> 44:11.189
Sometimes, I'm not very good though.

44:11.190 --> 44:13.273
My parents did most of
the cooking back home.

44:13.274 --> 44:14.979
What kind of...
Where are your...

44:14.980 --> 44:16.649
Sorry, go on.
What kind of things

44:16.650 --> 44:19.849
do you like to cook?
Oh anything really.

44:19.850 --> 44:21.300
I'm always trying new things.

44:22.434 --> 44:24.579
So where are your parents?

44:24.580 --> 44:27.069
Do you still keep in contact with them?

44:27.070 --> 44:27.903
Occasionally.

44:29.180 --> 44:31.339
We don't really have much to talk about.

44:31.340 --> 44:33.679
They retired to Townsville
a few years ago.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.473
Hm, that's a shame.

44:35.474 --> 44:37.269
I think it's important to keep in touch

44:37.270 --> 44:39.199
with people from your past.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.263
Especially family.

44:42.340 --> 44:44.959
My parents have passed.

44:44.960 --> 44:49.313
Left me this house, no way
I could afford it otherwise.

44:50.700 --> 44:54.199
But, uh, just think it's important

44:54.200 --> 44:57.551
that you should keep that
bond strong with your family.

44:57.552 --> 45:01.859
Maybe, we just weren't
really that close.

45:01.860 --> 45:05.053
I don't think they got me.
That's a shame.

45:05.970 --> 45:07.020
I don't blame them.

45:07.980 --> 45:09.349
Anyway, that's not important.

45:09.350 --> 45:11.299
Why don't you tell me
about some of this stuff?

45:11.300 --> 45:12.400
Yeah, sure, alright.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.503
Let's start the grand tour, shall we?

45:18.260 --> 45:19.093
So?

45:20.586 --> 45:25.586
Ah, here I have my diploma of fine arts

45:25.850 --> 45:29.859
which is worth absolutely
nothing.

45:29.860 --> 45:33.038
But it does look pretty and
makes people think I'm fancy.

45:33.039 --> 45:38.039
Here I've got some sculptures
I did back in high school.

45:38.050 --> 45:40.379
They don't impress anyone.

45:40.380 --> 45:43.289
They're good.
Thanks.

45:43.290 --> 45:45.159
I've got some photos here of some people

45:45.160 --> 45:47.883
that are quite special to me.

45:49.410 --> 45:51.010
Oh this one here, this man here,

45:51.980 --> 45:53.083
he's very special.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.853
Very big influence in my life.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.119
Now you should listen carefully

45:58.120 --> 46:01.113
because this is something
you need to know about me.

46:03.033 --> 46:03.866
Mm.

46:05.162 --> 46:06.912
That's a good cookie.

46:08.433 --> 46:09.600
Just a second.

46:10.660 --> 46:11.493
Mm.

46:18.089 --> 46:19.756
This is really good.

46:23.277 --> 46:26.248
Did you really?
Uh, yep.

46:26.249 --> 46:30.609
And then I sold it to
some guy for 50 bucks

46:30.610 --> 46:33.999
so now she's hanging forever immortalized

46:34.000 --> 46:37.184
in some guy's house
with this glorious head

46:37.185 --> 46:39.186
of cornstarch.

46:39.187 --> 46:41.200
It's just ridiculous.

46:41.201 --> 46:43.873
Anyway, that was worth her not paying me.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.779
Screw her.

46:46.780 --> 46:48.337
Um, Joseph?
Mm?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.299
Why did you put so
much effort into a career

46:51.300 --> 46:55.330
that's so hard to get by with?
What do you mean?

46:55.331 --> 46:56.919
In portraits.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.426
You hardly earn any money from them

46:58.427 --> 47:00.219
and you've had to take
up all these other jobs

47:00.220 --> 47:03.767
just to support it, it
seems like too much effort.

47:03.768 --> 47:06.209
Because I love it, of course.

47:06.210 --> 47:07.449
Don't you have anything you love to do

47:07.450 --> 47:11.969
that you make sacrifices for?
Yeah I guess.

47:11.970 --> 47:13.459
What do you love about painting

47:13.460 --> 47:15.992
that you can't get from a photograph?

47:15.993 --> 47:19.349
I don't know, I mean,
there's certain feelings

47:19.350 --> 47:21.679
you can get from a painting you can't get

47:21.680 --> 47:24.259
from a straight forward depiction of them.

47:24.260 --> 47:25.929
So you embellish, just here and there,

47:25.930 --> 47:29.739
to capture them, emote a feel.

47:29.740 --> 47:34.143
So, like impressionism?
Yeah, exactly.

47:35.550 --> 47:37.999
But surely if you
want to capture someone

47:38.000 --> 47:40.259
then showing them exactly
how they are in detail

47:40.260 --> 47:42.022
is the best way?

47:43.390 --> 47:44.223
No.

47:45.110 --> 47:46.889
I mean, yeah that's one
way of looking at it

47:46.890 --> 47:51.269
but for me, at least, you
need something more than that.

47:51.270 --> 47:53.029
You can look at a detailed photograph

47:53.030 --> 47:56.389
and see every pore, every
muscle in their iris,

47:56.390 --> 47:58.829
every hair on their face but,

47:58.830 --> 48:01.649
that doesn't show you
what's going on inside.

48:01.650 --> 48:04.399
Those kind of details do have
their own beauty, of course,

48:04.400 --> 48:08.849
but I don't know, it's like music.

48:08.850 --> 48:10.849
You get a strong feeling
when you hear music

48:10.850 --> 48:14.809
but what is a C flat or D minor sharp

48:14.810 --> 48:17.449
have to do with those feelings?

48:17.450 --> 48:19.519
They're just vibrations in the air

48:19.520 --> 48:21.769
at varying frequencies.

48:21.770 --> 48:26.359
Yet, you can express your
thoughts and your feelings

48:26.360 --> 48:30.299
a lot better using music
than say a brain scan.

48:30.300 --> 48:32.399
I don't know, that's what I think

48:32.400 --> 48:34.329
and that's why every time I paint someone,

48:34.330 --> 48:36.289
I'll sit them down and I'll talk to them

48:36.290 --> 48:37.754
and get that real emotive feeling

48:37.755 --> 48:39.433
before I start to paint.

48:40.450 --> 48:43.169
Otherwise, the details, they're just,

48:43.170 --> 48:46.559
it's just information and
it doesn't really show you

48:46.560 --> 48:48.083
what's going on inside, so.

48:49.420 --> 48:52.873
I don't know, I'm just,
talking nonsense aren't I?

48:53.708 --> 48:56.219
Anyway, I gotta go use
the little boy's room,

48:56.220 --> 48:59.229
if you don't mind waiting
here for a minute?

48:59.230 --> 49:00.809
No.
If you get bored,

49:00.810 --> 49:03.639
I've got some paints and
some brushes over there.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.739
Maybe you can get started on a portrait

49:05.740 --> 49:10.740
and do a picture of this
handsome mug.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.379
Hey, why don't we put
on some music and dance?

49:52.380 --> 49:54.989
You can paint, dance and cook?

49:54.990 --> 49:56.889
Well, who said I could dance?

49:56.890 --> 49:58.833
I said we should, not that I could.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.073
Oh.

50:02.040 --> 50:02.873
Well.

50:04.660 --> 50:07.700
I don't really dance, either.
Ah, who cares?

50:08.802 --> 50:10.885
I want to dance with you.

50:13.484 --> 50:14.317
Okay.

50:21.990 --> 50:23.419
It's not that I don't want to.

50:23.420 --> 50:25.903
I've just never danced before.

50:27.870 --> 50:30.227
I'm a little bit uncomfortable.

50:30.228 --> 50:32.012
Oh, that's alright.

50:32.013 --> 50:33.669
Why don't you come over
here and have a look

50:33.670 --> 50:36.059
at the records and I'm
sure there's something here

50:36.060 --> 50:38.500
that you can feel in sync with.

50:52.293 --> 50:53.793
I love this one.

51:38.157 --> 51:40.315
I do not understand this thing at all.

51:40.316 --> 51:43.531
You just have to hit it around.

51:43.532 --> 51:44.699
Around what?

51:45.890 --> 51:48.676
Around and through,
past all the little holes.

51:48.677 --> 51:51.844
So I've got to get them in the hole?

51:58.400 --> 52:03.360
Would I wed what would...

52:03.361 --> 52:06.432
Would you wed what
Edward Woodward would wed?

52:06.433 --> 52:08.930
Would I we'd what Wedward
Woodward would would

52:08.931 --> 52:09.764
would would?
Yeah, yeah.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.531
That's it right?
Nailed it!

52:19.674 --> 52:21.690
Between your thumbs.
Mm-hmm.

52:22.653 --> 52:24.151
And then you blow
kind of across the top,

52:24.152 --> 52:25.652
like a bottle cap.

53:13.822 --> 53:14.674
Oh!

53:48.467 --> 53:51.003
The difference isn't
strictly the size of the sensor

53:51.004 --> 53:52.654
but the size of the photo sights.

53:54.756 --> 53:57.979
So, uh, the less resolution the better?

53:57.980 --> 54:00.410
Well, less resolution means less detail

54:00.411 --> 54:02.869
but at night if you're
boosting the ISO too high

54:02.870 --> 54:05.339
you won't get as sharp a picture anyway.

54:05.340 --> 54:06.921
So a lower resolution camera means

54:06.922 --> 54:09.299
that you'll have larger photo sights

54:09.300 --> 54:10.639
for the size of the sensor

54:10.640 --> 54:13.857
and you won't loose as much
detail from boosting the ISO.

54:13.858 --> 54:15.773
Yeah, I think I've got it.

54:17.150 --> 54:20.779
Hey, why don't you join
a photography class?

54:20.780 --> 54:23.199
You're obviously really
passionate about it.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.899
So?
I just,

54:25.900 --> 54:28.650
think it's a good idea for
you to meet some new people.

54:29.609 --> 54:31.159
I don't really feel the need.

54:33.210 --> 54:36.359
Isn't that what you said
when you first met me?

54:36.360 --> 54:38.150
I said, I don't know.

54:39.048 --> 54:42.029
Most people are too hard
to connect with anyway.

54:42.030 --> 54:43.703
Yeah, but, what if we break up?

54:45.680 --> 54:47.303
Are you?

54:47.304 --> 54:48.669
Oh.

54:48.670 --> 54:49.899
No, that's not what I meant.

54:49.900 --> 54:52.139
I'm just saying, hypothetically.

54:52.140 --> 54:54.859
I have zero intention of
breaking up with you, Gwen.

54:54.860 --> 54:57.439
I just, think, you know,

54:57.440 --> 54:59.529
I shouldn't be the only
thing in your life.

54:59.530 --> 55:00.363
You're not.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.750
I always find some way to fill my time.

55:04.910 --> 55:06.910
How do you think I got by before we met?

55:08.928 --> 55:09.920
Not that I have any intention

55:09.921 --> 55:11.849
of breaking up with you either.

55:11.850 --> 55:14.489
It's been nice getting to know you.

55:14.490 --> 55:17.029
Well, okay.

55:17.030 --> 55:19.089
But think about it, alright?

55:19.090 --> 55:21.299
I think you might actually enjoy it.

55:21.300 --> 55:24.413
You just gotta put yourself out there.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.920
There's not much to put out there.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.969
Gwen, you know that's not true.

55:31.970 --> 55:33.879
When I first met you I could see,

55:33.880 --> 55:35.830
there was more to you than met the eye.

55:37.390 --> 55:39.869
And sure at first you didn't
have a whole lot to say

55:39.870 --> 55:43.319
but as things went on we saw
how much we had in common.

55:43.320 --> 55:45.423
Your own little interests and quirks.

55:46.380 --> 55:48.959
There's a whole lot of
people out there, Gwen.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.679
Some not so easy to get on with, some are.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.630
But that doesn't mean you just give up.

55:56.030 --> 55:57.433
My personal philosophy?

55:58.340 --> 56:00.719
Is to never stop trying new things.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.770
That's how I met you.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.013
Had a gut feeling and I just went with it.

56:06.139 --> 56:07.649
And thanks for that,

56:07.650 --> 56:10.953
but I think I just got lucky with you.

56:12.630 --> 56:15.529
I guess we just have enough in common

56:15.530 --> 56:17.230
that we both like each other, but,

56:20.570 --> 56:23.939
you're not the only time
I've tried to make friends.

56:23.940 --> 56:26.423
You're just one of the
first times it's worked.

56:31.336 --> 56:32.573
Most people are just,

56:34.670 --> 56:36.320
they're more interesting than me.

56:39.132 --> 56:41.463
They ask me about myself and,

56:43.110 --> 56:44.660
I don't know what to tell them.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.940
I look inside myself and

56:56.006 --> 56:56.839
there's,

56:58.250 --> 56:59.653
just nothing there.

57:19.010 --> 57:20.369
Hello, Gwen.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.193
Interesting collection you've got here.

57:25.210 --> 57:26.510
How did you get in here?

57:27.487 --> 57:29.859
Well you didn't lock
your door this morning.

57:29.860 --> 57:33.286
Lucky I noticed, it could
have been someone not so nice.

57:33.287 --> 57:35.863
You know a burgular, or worse, the police.

57:37.510 --> 57:40.209
Leave my apartment, please.
Now I always knew

57:40.210 --> 57:42.889
you were a bit of a freak
but I never realized

57:42.890 --> 57:44.399
you were this fucked up.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.843
What is all this shit, Gwen?

57:48.150 --> 57:50.909
Kennedy, please.
Nah.

57:50.910 --> 57:53.979
I wanna know what the deal
is with all this stuff.

57:53.980 --> 57:55.799
It's just something I do.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.317
I never hurt anyone.
Hm.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.169
I gotta say the detail here is impressive.

58:02.170 --> 58:04.735
You're breaking and
entering, I'll call the police.

58:06.260 --> 58:08.459
You? Call the police?

58:08.460 --> 58:10.169
I should be the one doing that.

58:10.170 --> 58:13.719
Do you have any idea how
illegal this stuff is?

58:13.720 --> 58:16.086
Well, I can only assume so,
otherwise you wouldn't have

58:16.087 --> 58:17.583
gotten away with it.

58:18.630 --> 58:19.463
Looks like you've done a bit

58:19.464 --> 58:21.689
of breaking and entering yourself.

58:21.690 --> 58:24.563
Is it for the thrill?
Kennedy, please.

58:26.300 --> 58:27.952
Ah, come on now Gwen, how long

58:27.953 --> 58:30.559
have we been neighbors for, eh?

58:30.560 --> 58:33.110
Now I don't care if you're
a little bit of a creep.

58:34.030 --> 58:34.970
Oh geez, you're trembling.

58:34.970 --> 58:35.963
Sit down, will you?

58:40.650 --> 58:44.189
Okay look, I could go
to the police right now

58:44.190 --> 58:47.609
and get you into more
trouble than you can handle.

58:47.610 --> 58:50.539
Or I could do the neighborly thing

58:50.540 --> 58:51.790
and let you off the hook.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.209
Thing is though, I've known
you for nearly two years

58:56.210 --> 58:58.788
and you haven't done shit for me.

58:58.789 --> 59:02.687
Now that I know you've got some
experience in surveillance,

59:04.727 --> 59:06.579
there may be something you can do

59:06.580 --> 59:08.679
and if you help me out?

59:08.680 --> 59:12.049
Maybe I could forget this
whole thing ever happened.

59:12.050 --> 59:12.883
Sound good?

59:14.626 --> 59:17.199
Gwen?
Yeah, sounds good.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.000
Alright, here's the deal, me and Marco

59:20.001 --> 59:22.229
have been together since not long after

59:22.230 --> 59:24.449
I moved into this shithole.

59:24.450 --> 59:26.599
We were saving up to buy a proper house,

59:26.600 --> 59:29.369
only two months ago he was laid off.

59:29.370 --> 59:32.339
Now, it's just been me
working 25 hours a week,

59:32.340 --> 59:33.553
earning shit all.

59:34.670 --> 59:37.399
Now he says he's been
looking for a new job.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.879
Personally I don't think
he's doing anything at all

59:39.880 --> 59:41.699
because every time I see him at home,

59:41.700 --> 59:43.269
he's always watching the fuckin' footie

59:43.270 --> 59:45.813
or playing those fuckin' video games.

59:45.814 --> 59:48.349
Then he's going out all the time

59:48.350 --> 59:50.973
and what's worse, he's taken
money out of my wallet.

59:52.150 --> 59:54.579
He denies it but that much money

59:54.580 --> 59:56.233
just ain't fuckin' disappearing.

01:00:00.133 --> 01:00:02.899
I need to know what he's
spending all this money on.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.100
I have a feeling he
might be gambling again.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.339
So I need you to tail him this weekend.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.349
I want photos.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:14.857
Find out what he's doing
and don't let him see you.

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:17.763
Kennedy, I don't...

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.919
It's just one little favor, Gwen.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.599
Don't act like this is gonna
be anything difficult for you.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.100
You do this sort of thing
all the time, don't you?

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:30.419
Oh and, keep in mind I'm not obligated

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.959
to keep this under wraps.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.210
I could have the police
here in five minutes.

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:37.659
Okay.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:38.493
I'll do it.

01:00:40.339 --> 01:00:43.453
There's a good girl.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.957
Alright, let's start off with Stalker

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:50.983
and then Holiday Inn.
Sounds good.

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:57.229
Just so you know, I won't be
available this Sunday night.

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.629
Oh, me neither, that's okay.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:00.463
Again?

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.179
Yeah, I'm never available Sunday night.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.329
Didn't I tell you?
Why not?

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.549
What's on Sundays?

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:08.709
You used to be available Sundays.

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:11.243
Well that's my business, now isn't it?

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.069
Yeah but, you usually
share most of what's going on

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.173
in your life with me.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.473
I guess but not everything.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:30.627
Is everything okay?
Of course.

01:01:30.628 --> 01:01:33.723
You're not like going to see a doctor?

01:01:35.022 --> 01:01:39.203
No, of course not, Gwen.
Then what is it?

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.160
It's just my business, okay?

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.947
Why don't you want to talk about it?

01:01:47.948 --> 01:01:49.585
It's not that I don't
want to talk about it,

01:01:49.586 --> 01:01:51.519
it's just that I shouldn't have to.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.143
Everyone deserves the right to...

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:57.689
Look, I don't ask you
about every little detail

01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:58.959
of your life, okay?

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.760
All I'm asking is the same courtesy.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.369
Just forget about it, alright?

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:05.203
Let's just,

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.880
let's just relax and watch the movie.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.689
Look, I'm sorry to get like that.

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:19.740
Let's just forget it.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.929
Look, come here, let's
just watch a movie, okay?

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:26.723
Yeah, sorry about that.
That's okay.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:32.475
I could just lay like this forever.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.259
You forgot to put the movie in.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.808
Oh.

01:02:37.809 --> 01:02:38.642
Sorry.

01:04:16.755 --> 01:04:20.358
Hi, who do you know here?
Marco.

01:04:20.359 --> 01:04:23.318
Oh, how do you know Marcy?
Oh from a while back.

01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:24.454
Oh, cool, cool.

01:04:24.455 --> 01:04:26.397
We went to hairdressing school together.

01:04:26.398 --> 01:04:29.151
Oh.

01:04:29.152 --> 01:04:30.235
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:02.842 --> 01:05:04.609
I win! I win!

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.127
I've got it, oh my god.

01:05:07.128 --> 01:05:09.053
I swear I'm unbeatable at this game,

01:05:09.054 --> 01:05:11.971
unbeatable.
Again, again, alright.

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:26.114
Freddy's gonna forget it, seriously.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:29.097
He's a whiny little shit.

01:05:30.306 --> 01:05:31.139
I was forgetting about it.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.779
Jesus, Tucker, it's not
me who can't get over it.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.643
Anyway, what about Kennedy?

01:05:37.644 --> 01:05:40.364
Is she giving you shit?
It's Kennedy,

01:05:40.365 --> 01:05:42.123
she's always giving me shit, yes, yeah.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:45.659
I don't even fuckin' watch

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.038
stuff like that.
Oh, okay.

01:05:48.039 --> 01:05:52.191
Because your broke you get by without it.

01:05:52.192 --> 01:05:54.086
I have the fun

01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:55.417
and as soon as I get a job

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:58.301
I am gonna leave it on the sheet.

01:05:58.302 --> 01:06:01.085
Is that where you were
getting that money from?

01:06:01.086 --> 01:06:02.628
Nah.

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:06.689
I've been actually taking
some out of her wallet, yeah.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:09.601
Every now and then.
You sneaky shit.

01:06:09.602 --> 01:06:12.739
And she hasn't noticed?
Oh no, she has.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.349
And she actually brought it up

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:17.629
and then I said, I need
to fix the air conditioner

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.902
and yeah, she bought it.

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.669
Fuck it, she's a bitch
and she's never even

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.329
putting out anymore so, fuck her.

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:32.263
I mean, it's done.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.969
Anyway, I'm gonna
actually go to the bedroom

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:37.232
because I actually have
something to show you.

01:06:37.233 --> 01:06:38.650
It's kind of why we're here.

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:30.502
Don't fucking lie to me.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:33.830
Oi, who's this little pervert?

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.320
What do you think you're doing

01:07:36.321 --> 01:07:38.732
peeking through the bedroom window, Missy?

01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:39.733
Is it a good show?

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.149
Here's $50.

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:46.350
Don't say anything to
anyone and it's yours.

01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:48.123
Deal.

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:51.419
This is just between you and me though?

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.441
Like you said, I'm a pervert.

01:07:53.442 --> 01:07:58.442
You don't think I'm the
only one here, do you?

01:09:53.169 --> 01:09:54.606
Are you alright, Gwen?

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.014
Is something on your mind?

01:09:57.015 --> 01:09:58.765
Do you ever,

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.500
do you ever wonder if you
really know the people you know?

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:06.399
Oh this isn't about...
No, it's nothing to do

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.913
with you or anything, I just,

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.083
something happened recently to someone,

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.701
one of my neighbors.

01:10:16.702 --> 01:10:19.535
Oh, what happened?
It was just,

01:10:22.067 --> 01:10:25.199
her partner, they've
been together for years

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.452
then she found out he
was doing all this stuff

01:10:27.453 --> 01:10:30.763
behind her back, unpleasant stuff.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.457
Well that sucks.
Just got to me, you know?

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:41.119
Like, you think everything's
the way you think it is

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.009
and it can turn out to
be completely different

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:46.209
and then you lose everything
you thought was true,

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:50.239
just like that.
Everyone has secrets, Gwen.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.003
I don't think you can ever avoid that.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.009
I know and I agree
with you that it's okay

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.760
to keep some stuff to yourself but,

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.028
how can you ever know
it's not a bad secret?

01:11:04.029 --> 01:11:06.649
Well what's a bad secret?

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:08.879
Doesn't it all depend on
who you're talking to?

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.819
I mean different people feel different

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.653
about different things.

01:11:12.654 --> 01:11:16.953
I mean maybe he did something
that she didn't like.

01:11:18.351 --> 01:11:20.553
Ultimately it's all a
matter of perspective.

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:23.640
It was definitely bad stuff.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.800
Well, I'll
take your word for it.

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.430
But it's the little stuff, too.

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.513
Sometimes, I just don't
understand how people think.

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:40.773
Nobody wants to tell you how they think

01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:43.587
so you can never really know them.

01:11:44.818 --> 01:11:46.618
You can only know things about them.

01:11:48.045 --> 01:11:51.109
Well, I guess
nobody really knows anybody

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.360
when it comes down to it.

01:11:56.686 --> 01:11:58.736
I had this friend once, in high school.

01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:03.853
Her name was Julia.
That's a nice name.

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.583
One day she told me she
didn't want to hang out anymore.

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:13.723
How come?
She wouldn't say.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.389
She never fought with me or seemed angry.

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:19.823
Mostly she seemed happy.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.256
That's what got to me.

01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:24.743
I thought I knew her.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.373
I love you.
I love you, too.

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.159
Gwen, I wouldn't worry about it.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.919
These things happen.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.053
Not everything is like you
and Julia or your neighbor.

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:44.279
I guess to me, really knowing somebody,

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.439
isn't just about knowing
things about them.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.559
It's about being able to
have a great conversation.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.830
It's about being able to
sit comfortably in silence.

01:12:54.665 --> 01:12:57.919
It's getting their favorite
bloody song stuck in your head.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.447
If I could say anybody knows
anybody, it'd be like that.

01:13:02.905 --> 01:13:05.568
Like you and me.
Cute Joe,

01:13:05.569 --> 01:13:07.269
do you want to be any more sappy?

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.747
Maybe knowing each other is
when you sew yourselves together

01:13:09.748 --> 01:13:11.752
like co-joined twins and
bury yourselves alive

01:13:11.753 --> 01:13:14.336
so you can be together forever.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.029
Um?

01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:18.906
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

01:13:29.648 --> 01:13:32.774
You get called in for another shift?

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.858
It's nothing important.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.959
Gwen, why have you been ignoring me?

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.479
Sorry Kennedy, I was...
What kind of sick game

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.539
are you playing, you fuckin' liar?

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.589
I didn't lie.
Yes you fuckin' did.

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.489
Marco is not a cheater.

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:55.089
You were just lying to me for finding out

01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:57.759
your little secret.
I didn't lie.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.889
He wouldn't do that to me.

01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:01.690
All those things you said about him.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.943
Where's your proof, huh?

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:06.449
Couldn't get any fuckin' photos.

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.969
Do you just want to fuck
up our relationship?

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:09.803
Would you be quiet?

01:14:09.804 --> 01:14:11.919
We shouldn't even be talking
about this in public.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.159
I tried to get photos, I missed my chance.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.069
Some guy came up and
saw me sneaking around.

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:20.399
Everything I told you
is true, word for word.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.513
You are a fucking little liar.

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:26.099
You probably didn't even
follow him, did you?

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.564
Did you?

01:14:27.565 --> 01:14:30.079
Now you go back out there
and you show me the truth,

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.274
not some bullshit story.
Look,

01:14:32.275 --> 01:14:34.089
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.009
I did it once, I did what you asked.

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:38.373
If you can't accept that
then that's your problem.

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.739
I'm tired of it.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.890
I wish it was something
else but it wasn't.

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:47.103
Fuck you!

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.299
Hey.
Hey.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.889
So you did end up
getting the night free?

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:04.723
Yeah.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.047
How are you?
I'm good.

01:15:08.048 --> 01:15:10.049
You?
I'm okay.

01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:14.073
Where are we going?
Actually, tonight,

01:15:16.073 --> 01:15:17.399
I thought about what
you said the other week

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.040
about keeping secrets and

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:24.209
you're right, I have
been meaning to tell you.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:26.821
I always was going to tell you.

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:29.529
But you're right, we
shouldn't be hiding things

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:30.363
from each other.

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:32.749
And it's really not that
bad, really, I mean.

01:15:33.651 --> 01:15:35.853
Well, it depends how you look at it.

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.653
Joseph, you don't have to.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.340
I shouldn't have pried
into your business, anyway.

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.139
I trust you.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.309
I should have always trusted you.

01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:52.889
No.

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:55.549
You were right, I was eventually
gonna have to tell you

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:58.023
so it's better I tell
you sooner than later.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:06.669
It's okay, I don't mind
you having secrets anymore.

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:09.619
It doesn't matter, as long
as we both accept each other

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.523
for who we are.
Well that's the thing.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.849
I'm not sure whether or
not you will accept me.

01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:18.600
Could you just trust that I will?

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.413
No.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.599
Well maybe you could just tell me

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.989
rather than show me?
I think it's better

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:32.283
if I just, show you.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.959
This is all
sounding very serious.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.973
Yeah well, it's not as bad
as I'm making it sound, really.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.249
Well.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.833
It's just important to me that I show you.

01:16:47.635 --> 01:16:49.980
Okay.

01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:56.979
This was stupid.
I told you,

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.847
it's not gonna make me feel
any differently about you.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.623
Thanks for saying that, Gwen.

01:18:04.529 --> 01:18:09.529
Alright.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:46.340
Try not to jump to any conclusions, okay?

01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:06.573
Hey, it's nice to meet you, Gwen.

01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:14.383
He's 13 months since last Thursday.

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:18.304
You can hold him, if you like?

01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:19.273
I'm okay.

01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:23.209
I hope it's not too much Gwen.

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.469
I just thought it would be a good idea

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:25.303
for you to see him for yourself

01:19:25.304 --> 01:19:27.779
before you decided how you feel.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.999
Me and Joseph aren't involved,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.986
in case you're thinking that.

01:19:30.987 --> 01:19:32.939
It was a one time thing two years ago.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.490
We dated for a while ages
back, but not since then.

01:19:37.822 --> 01:19:39.059
It's just this one time, Red and I got

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.460
into a real big fight...
Oh, she doesn't know.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.723
Oh, Red's my husband,
well fiance back then.

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:52.529
It was a stupid, impulsive thing

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:54.886
and it only happened once

01:19:54.887 --> 01:19:57.237
but we ended up with this
beautiful boy, Simon.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.939
Red knows now.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.679
It wasn't the cleanest of situations

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.180
but most of that is behind us.

01:20:08.327 --> 01:20:09.970
I know it's a big thing Gwen.

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.903
Simon is a part of my life.

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:15.827
I come here every Sunday now

01:20:15.828 --> 01:20:18.160
and I imagine as he gets older,

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:21.453
I'll want to come and see him more often.

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:26.460
I don't expect you to be too
involved or anything but...

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.900
I'd better go fill up Simon's bottle.

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:41.413
Gwen.

01:20:42.311 --> 01:20:44.123
Just say something, please?

01:20:49.999 --> 01:20:54.019
It's fine.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.893
Joe, I can handle this.

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:02.469
To be honest, it's not like I ever thought

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:05.623
about having anything even
remotely close to a family.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.220
Any kind of attachment at all, but

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:15.013
it feels kind of nice, to be
a part of something like this.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.233
I mean,

01:21:20.063 --> 01:21:20.896
I love you.

01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:25.016
Whoever thought I'd say
those words to anyone?

01:21:25.017 --> 01:21:26.803
And you obviously love Simon.

01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:29.209
There's no part of me that would want

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:31.580
to take away either of those things.

01:21:37.253 --> 01:21:40.529
Hi Joe.

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.069
Oh, hey Red.

01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:45.026
So you finally brought
your girlfriend over?

01:21:45.027 --> 01:21:45.860
Yeah.

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:51.749
I've seen you before.
What?

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:54.373
Last week, you were in
the car down the road.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.753
Gwen, what were you
doing here last week?

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:12.413
Gwen?

01:22:29.052 --> 01:22:30.885
Gwen, what's going on?

01:22:32.933 --> 01:22:34.593
Have you been spying on me?

01:22:37.143 --> 01:22:39.343
Answer me, Gwen, what
the hell is going on?

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.653
You were spying on me?

01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:54.210
Was it just this one time?

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.820
Try to understand.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.000
Why did you do it?

01:23:19.413 --> 01:23:20.343
I told you.

01:23:22.223 --> 01:23:23.757
It was just curiosity.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.359
I just wanted to study you.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.560
I didn't plan the way
things ended up being.

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:36.650
And you've done this
with what, 35 other people?

01:23:38.163 --> 01:23:40.135
Studied them, yeah.

01:23:40.136 --> 01:23:43.246
But you are the first one I even spoke to,

01:23:43.247 --> 01:23:45.080
more than momentarily.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.953
I'm trying, I'm trying to understand...

01:23:49.954 --> 01:23:52.537
You don't have to understand.

01:23:55.176 --> 01:23:57.783
You used me.
I didn't use you.

01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:00.959
I meant nearly everything I said.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.889
I just didn't tell you
about this one thing.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:05.169
What about all that other stuff, huh?

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:08.459
All that other stuff we
coincidentially had in common?

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.293
What about that?

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.429
That was all bullshit.

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.153
All written down in your
little book before we even met.

01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:19.269
Do you have any idea how hard it was

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:20.669
for me to show you Simon?

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:22.689
I told you it didn't need to be.

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.197
Yeah, I guess not.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.229
You already knew about him.
I just,

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:30.069
I wanted to know where
you went every Sunday.

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.220
I hadn't followed you
in more than a month.

01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.699
I just, I didn't want you keeping

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.643
that part of your life secret from me.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.513
And I didn't!

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.749
I always was gonna tell you.

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.679
But you didn't let me.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.299
You took that from me

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.339
and it wasn't even yours to take

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.240
but not just that,

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:51.729
when I took you to the the lake

01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:54.180
to show you where I went
camping as a little boy,

01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:56.670
you already knew about it.

01:24:57.862 --> 01:25:01.387
When I showed you my portraits,
you'd already seen them.

01:25:04.075 --> 01:25:06.649
I was showing you some of
the most precious things

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:07.663
in my life, I was,

01:25:09.051 --> 01:25:11.289
I was letting you in.

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:14.093
I was letting you see
what was important to me.

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:18.633
I thought I was showing
you something special.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.660
But you already fuckin' knew about it all.

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:37.483
I think,

01:25:40.143 --> 01:25:42.823
I think I'm gonna need some
time to think about this Gwen.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.873
It's just

01:25:49.018 --> 01:25:49.851
so...

01:27:03.712 --> 01:27:05.819
Are you coming to bed Joe?

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.670
It's pretty late.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.033
In a minute.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.360
Do you want to talk about it?

01:27:15.361 --> 01:27:19.743
No, I just need some time alone.

01:28:45.715 --> 01:28:46.548
Sorry.

01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:25.961
Hey.
Hey.

01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:31.150
I'm sorry about all that stuff before.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.163
Do you think,

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:37.910
maybe now you've had a
chance to think about it,

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.083
there's any way?

01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:43.283
Gwen.

01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:46.570
You're a sweet girl.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.260
There's a lot I really like about you.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.863
But, I just don't think
we can go on after this.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.793
I'm not doing that stuff anymore.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:03.467
If that's true, I'm happy for you.

01:30:04.954 --> 01:30:08.319
And I know your intentions
may have not been so bad

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.649
but I,

01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:13.500
just don't think I can go on
like you never did all that.

01:30:15.377 --> 01:30:16.973
It's just not something I can do.

01:30:23.066 --> 01:30:23.899
Wait here.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:34.003
You can have this back.
I don't want it.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:42.900
Actually, I will take it.

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:52.617
Thank you for asking me out.

01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:56.593
I think you're gonna be a great father.

01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:58.703
Thanks.

01:31:01.267 --> 01:31:02.417
You should join a club.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.173
Bye Joseph.

01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:11.643
Bye Gwen.

01:31:39.428 --> 01:31:41.209
Hey!
Hey!

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:42.819
You shaved your beard?
Yeah.

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.022
Thought I'd try something a bit different.

01:31:45.023 --> 01:31:45.946
Nuh-uh.
No?

01:31:45.947 --> 01:31:47.230
No.
You don't like it?

01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:48.606
No.
You don't like it.

01:31:48.607 --> 01:31:49.712
Nah.

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:52.359
I supposed I could try to grow it back.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.589
Good plan.

01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:54.929
So did you get your certificate?

01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:57.942
Sure did, I'm now fully
qualified to push wheelchairs

01:31:57.943 --> 01:32:00.162
and help old ladies change.

01:32:00.163 --> 01:32:02.219
Well I'm sorry I missed the ceremony.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.769
Oh you mean the one I held for myself

01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:06.349
while I waiting for them to
print out my certificate?

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.769
But I got you a little something

01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:09.672
to make it feel more officious.

01:32:09.673 --> 01:32:11.229
Oh, what?

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.793
It's a graduation hat, thingy.

01:32:14.658 --> 01:32:15.491
Ah-ha!

01:32:18.608 --> 01:32:19.639
Wait.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.902
Eh?
Yeah.

01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.714
I feel like I'm at Oxford.
You look like it.

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:26.783
We need to get a
picture of this, come on.

01:32:32.483 --> 01:32:33.570
Make sure you get the hat.
Okay.

01:32:35.099 --> 01:32:36.459
You know what...
I'm not tall enough.

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:38.879
Ah, just reach, stretch.
Okay.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.459
Yes!
I'm gonna wear this hat

01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:41.789
the rest of my life.
Yes.

01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:43.947
It's gonna be like
my just every day hat.
