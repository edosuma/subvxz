WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:03.133
I'’ve met someone now.

00:03.133 --> 00:07.007
He'’s not dating others.
He is, um...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.051
You know what I mean?

00:08.051 --> 00:09.618
I don'’t understand that.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.621
Me and my boyfriend have been
together for four months.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.058
This is an open relationship
that I'’m so unsure about.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.364
Where'’s your clothes?

00:16.364 --> 00:17.626
I'’m free-balling.
In the hallway.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.715
If I was in a
monogamous relationship,

00:19.715 --> 00:22.761
I wouldn'’t be flirting,
but I'’m not, so hello, Luka.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.242
Shots on me, literally,
on me if you want to.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.984
I'’m gonna get a line to
the bow of the jetski,

00:27.984 --> 00:29.377
so that carabineer
doesn'’t unhook,

00:29.377 --> 00:31.248
like a little bowline
and a little bowline.

00:31.248 --> 00:34.121
I love Lara'’s enthusiasm
to just get involved.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.601
I wanted to ask you about
the lead deckhand thing.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.692
- My name is Max. I'’m French.
- Nice to meet you, bro.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.395
We don'’t have time
to----ing sit around and wank.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.748
Come, we'’re not lazy
on this boat.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.578
Let me finish.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.406
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.103
You'’re gonna do this,
then I'’m gonna do this, too.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.497
Tumi, Natalya,
to the bridge now.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.890
That'’s not okay.
Please figure this out.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.676
There'’s no textbook to this,
but I do know as chief,

01:07.676 --> 01:10.113
I have to change
something on my part.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.593
- You okay to talk?
- Yes.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.856
20 meters to the
dock starboard quarter.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.292
I need you over here, please.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.207
Personally, I do not want
to be your friend,

01:17.207 --> 01:18.730
because I think it'’s all
fake bullsh--.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.168
You need to be clear.
One way in, one way out.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.039
Can you, like, shut
up a little bit?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.388
You can talk.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.824
I'’m running around like
a headless chicken,

01:25.824 --> 01:27.043
because we'’re both here
to make great tips.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.784
Okay, cool.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.699
You can talk as much
as you want later.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.657
If you do a thing wrong,
I have to tell you.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.532
If you just listen to me
and did the controls,

01:37.532 --> 01:39.621
it wouldn'’t have been a
- ing madhouse, bro.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.150
All right, well.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.326
♪ Namaste, Namaste

01:51.198 --> 01:53.374
It'’s the last day.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.597
Lord.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.212
Okay, we'’re all good and
nicely secure on the stern.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
We'’re still tying up.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.867
Huh?

02:08.867 --> 02:10.217
Haleigh and Max.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
Slow down. Communicate.

02:15.787 --> 02:16.745
Stop.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.486
Coming from tugs.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.053
The way that we'’re tying up is
different from what I'’m used to.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.751
That'’s my second
time ever doing it.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.365
Max, yapping at me while I'’m
trying to----ing figure it out.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.237
Okay, I'’m going to
put it back here, yeah?

02:30.237 --> 02:31.412
You can do whatever
you want, man.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.630
I don'’t really care.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.285
What the [bleep]?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.246
Ah!

02:43.728 --> 02:44.773
Hi.

02:44.773 --> 02:45.817
Why?

02:45.817 --> 02:47.123
Aren'’t you the bosun?

02:47.123 --> 02:48.516
Don'’t you have
to deal with people

02:48.516 --> 02:49.734
that no one else wants
to----ing deal with?

02:49.734 --> 02:51.214
Excuse me?

02:51.214 --> 02:53.216
Let'’s get changed and
then we'’ll do the luggage.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.609
- A little more butt.
- A little more butt?

02:54.609 --> 02:56.480
Lean forward,
a little more butt.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.657
We just talked it out, started
off okay, and then it went...

02:59.657 --> 03:00.789
Jesus.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.660
Finally got on
the dock nicely, so...

03:04.445 --> 03:05.663
Why is that?
What happened?

03:10.233 --> 03:12.017
All crew, all crew,
let'’s meet on the dock.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.367
Let'’s do it.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.849
- Bye.
- Love you, Natalya.

03:17.849 --> 03:18.850
Thank you.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.116
- Thank you, mama.
- Listen, Tumi, you already know.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.553
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.121
Sandy, you have an amazing crew.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.471
We travel a lot.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.560
This has been, by far,
one of our best.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.083
One of our best.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.998
Chef, we had a few hiccups
with Adjua'’s vegan meals,

03:35.998 --> 03:38.696
but I think some of the best
jerk lobster I'’ve ever had.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.610
Yes.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.656
Tumi, we want to take you home,

03:41.656 --> 03:44.049
and I'’m being 100% honest, Tumi.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.399
Continue to do amazing things.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.270
I mean, you guys were
all amazing, but Tumi...

03:48.706 --> 03:50.230
As usual, the guests
never know

03:50.230 --> 03:51.666
what'’s going on behind
the scenes.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.624
They just see us smiling
and everything'’s okay,

03:53.624 --> 03:54.843
so the fact that they
didn'’t pick up

03:54.843 --> 03:56.192
on the chaos is very good.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.672
From the bottom
of our hearts, guys.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.195
- Thank you.
- Bye, everybody.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.849
- Bye. Take care.
- Bye.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.720
All right, everyone, out of
your whites and to your reds,

04:02.720 --> 04:04.026
let'’s turn the boat around.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.897
Let'’s get changed.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.249
Yeah.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.165
- Cool.
- Cabins, cabins, cabins.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.389
Excuse me, honey.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.826
, it'’s hot.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.143
We'’re gonna get----ing
lit tonight.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.188
All crew, all crew,
let'’s meet in the sky lounge

04:36.188 --> 04:37.320
for our tip meeting.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.019
- Copy.
- Yay!

04:41.019 --> 04:43.065
Feels like it'’s five
charters in, doesn'’t it?

04:43.065 --> 04:44.371
It'’s crazy.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.242
When I first started,
I shared with you,

04:46.242 --> 04:48.462
I have to earn your respect
and your trust.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.291
What I left out is
you have to do it, too.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.510
We'’re always gonna
make mistakes,

04:53.510 --> 04:55.556
but you have to respect
the position

04:55.556 --> 04:56.905
and respect the workplace.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.647
And I want all of you
to think about that.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.735
This is a professional setting.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.214
I hire professional people

05:02.214 --> 05:03.738
and I expect them
to be professional.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.392
And that argument
that happened...

05:05.392 --> 05:06.610
Let me finish.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.264
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.918
You'’re gonna do this,
then I'’m gonna do this too.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.223
...can never happen again.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.660
And if they don'’t work
it out this charter,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.314
I have to make a big decision.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.011
Overall, you guys did
a great job,

05:16.011 --> 05:18.056
according to what
I'’m holding in my hand.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.971
We have...

05:19.971 --> 05:21.756
$26,000.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.235
Wow!

05:23.235 --> 05:25.368
Jesus!

05:25.368 --> 05:27.152
Which is $2,000 per person.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.328
Wow.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.025
That trip was so difficult,

05:30.025 --> 05:33.594
but the tip makes
it hurt a little less.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.856
Can you do the honors?

05:34.856 --> 05:36.423
Oh, sugar,
you'’re doing so great.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.381
More money doesn'’t
equal more problems.

05:38.381 --> 05:42.124
I'’m not Biggie.
I'’m Tumi.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.213
Thank you.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.129
- Cheers!
- Salud!

05:47.129 --> 05:48.478
Straviano!

05:48.478 --> 05:50.741
I just want to have
a great time tonight.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.308
How soon do I need to get ready?

05:52.308 --> 05:54.963
Let'’s get smashed.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.408
Oh, my God!

06:05.408 --> 06:07.062
You'’re like,
"He just packed my bag."

06:07.062 --> 06:09.107
Dude, I would have packed my bag
and gone straight----ing back.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.636
Oh, perfect age.

06:15.636 --> 06:16.767
Yeah.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.470
Oh, Luka is basically
the only thing

06:23.470 --> 06:24.993
getting me through
my days right now.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.777
Like, God, now
I'’m starting to think

06:26.777 --> 06:29.171
that I might like like Luka.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.694
Sounds very primary school-y,

06:30.694 --> 06:32.479
but that makes me feel like
I'’m cheating in my head.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.394
My mind is like a
little scrambled egg.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.527
No way!

06:37.527 --> 06:38.746
What? No way?

06:38.746 --> 06:40.356
I clean up well.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.664
Are you like, shocked that
I'’m looking like this right now?

06:43.664 --> 06:45.666
What the? [bleep] you!

06:45.666 --> 06:47.102
I need to wear a shirt

06:47.102 --> 06:49.278
my boobs won'’t easily
come out of.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.628
Because once they come out,
it'’s like game over.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.936
Are you ready?

06:59.723 --> 07:01.464
Yeah.
Okay, cool.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.601
Come, bitches!

07:11.431 --> 07:13.128
Oh, get off it.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.218
I know Luka and Natalya.
They'’ve got eyes for each other.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.700
But if they don'’t make it work,
I'’m on deck for Natalya.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.528
Luka won'’t give her
what I could give her.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.746
You know what I mean?

07:22.746 --> 07:24.487
No comment.
No comment.

07:24.487 --> 07:28.099
I want to pull on her hair
and smack her.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.667
I'’m joking.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.364
If I say some weird
lesbian sh--,

07:32.364 --> 07:33.670
it'’s okay, right Natalya?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.672
Yeah, of course, I love it.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.152
I'’m joking, but not.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.243
- Come here, honey.
- Oh, ready for a shot.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.505
Buona sera, signora.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.550
Oh, it'’s beautiful.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.247
Shotgun orange.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.466
- I want a drink.
- Tequila!

07:46.466 --> 07:47.945
Shot, shot, shot.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.299
The monarch butterfly.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.476
Smack dab right in the
middle of the chest.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.999
Definitely a hit
with the ladies.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.827
It'’s my grandmother's
favorite animal.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.788
Um, what am I saying that for?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.008
Hi.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.836
We'’re gonna do nine
espresso martinis.

08:08.836 --> 08:09.924
Margarita.

08:09.924 --> 08:10.925
Did you choose what
you want to eat?

08:10.925 --> 08:12.361
I'’ll have the meat, please.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.319
Can I have the meat
option as well?

08:14.319 --> 08:15.538
Can I please have the meat?

08:15.538 --> 08:18.149
I'’m vegetarian, please.
Thank you.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.110
This is a Frenchman here.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.027
Hello.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.029
- Cheers to Tumi.
- Oh, I love you.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.421
You'’re doing such a
great job, my honey.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.032
Cheers.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.166
I got a little bit of fish.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.428
Thank you.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.779
- Bon appetit, les amis.
- Bon appetit.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.172
The margarita.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.925
You guys, I cannot
believe our tip.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.753
I really thought
it was gonna be low.

08:56.753 --> 08:57.928
Yeah.
With those characters?

08:57.928 --> 09:00.061
Either you get a really low tip

09:00.061 --> 09:02.367
or you get a high tip
that shocks you.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.934
- So it goes two ways.
- Yeah.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.764
No, she was happy.
She was fine.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.287
- Yeah.
- It'’s club time.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.637
- Can I take it?
- Yeah, you can.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.986
Can we get the bill?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.422
What do you eat on charter?
Do you eat?

09:13.422 --> 09:14.771
Normally, I like
to just make a plate

09:14.771 --> 09:16.773
and just, like,
eat as I'’m going.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.514
Yeah, the same as me.
You never sit down.

09:18.514 --> 09:21.604
I'’d never, ever,
ever, ever, ever.

09:21.604 --> 09:25.521
Hold on. Did everybody
just start to get along?

09:25.521 --> 09:26.696
I'’m traumatized.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.831
Yeah, yeah, club.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.790
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.803
Oh, sh--!

09:46.803 --> 09:48.675
Okay, drink, drink,
drink, drink.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.720
Can I have three shots
of tequila?

09:54.071 --> 09:56.030
Woo!

09:57.379 --> 09:58.815
Bravo!

10:09.260 --> 10:10.740
Woo!

10:28.453 --> 10:29.933
Do you feel like a bit weird?

10:49.953 --> 10:51.346
Wow.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.869
I mean, look,
I'’m taking it back.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
I wasn'’t expecting her
to say this.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.917
And I want to trust it
and believe it.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.701
But I think it'’s the tequila.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.489
'’Til the end!

11:04.489 --> 11:05.490
Coming up...

11:05.490 --> 11:06.927
I feel like sh--.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.363
If you feel like you need to
go to the emergency room

11:08.363 --> 11:10.321
and get checked out,
we'’ll do that.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.470
She realized what she did.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.652
No!

11:36.652 --> 11:38.045
Let'’s go.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.005
I'’m voting for
the drunkest person...

11:42.005 --> 11:43.137
Jess.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.185
I need to catch up.
I need three tequila shots.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.405
Jess, go see if
the jacuzzi'’s hot.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.408
I'’m drunk.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.367
I need to pee really bad.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.502
Okay. Let'’s go.
Come on.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.549
You moves.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.247
Let get in the jacuzzi.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.163
Mmm.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.471
I love kissing people.
It'’s just drunk fun.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.170
You know, it'’s like
kissing your brother.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.392
See, I don'’t have
brothers or sisters.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.004
I feel like that'’s appropriate
to say, but it'’s not.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.746
Incest is not.
It'’s not what I'm going for.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.230
What?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.231
Hey, Jack!

12:37.408 --> 12:39.759
Do you want water or
do you want anything?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.770
Do you need water
or anything?

12:55.339 --> 12:56.819
Oh!

13:07.699 --> 13:09.571
What, what, what, oh!

13:15.316 --> 13:16.796
Thank [bleep].

13:26.631 --> 13:27.937
Let'’s go.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.000
Okay, what'’s going on?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.310
I do want to kiss him,

13:53.310 --> 13:56.009
but I don'’t want to hurt
my boyfriend'’s feelings,

13:56.009 --> 13:57.358
and that'’s the problem.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.367
We'’re going to bed.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.631
Good night.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.460
Oh...

14:23.471 --> 14:25.995
Hello, boss.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.137
Mm-hmm.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.886
Yeah.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
Although I love
a good tea, honey,

14:58.506 --> 15:00.638
and I'’m glad that
Natalya and Tumi

15:00.638 --> 15:03.076
made up about the text message.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.340
Last night she messaged me.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.911
I'’m just not happy with
Natalya informing Sandy

15:11.911 --> 15:13.216
and using my name in that.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.958
Tumi texted Kyle behind my back.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.352
Me revealing Tumi'’s
message to Natalya

15:18.352 --> 15:20.223
was an act of friendship,

15:20.223 --> 15:23.139
not for Natalya to weaponize me
against other people.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.706
All right, jumping into
cabins, babe.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.274
There'’s only room for one gossip
on this boat right now.

15:27.274 --> 15:31.756
That'’s me, I am the Tea Queen.

15:31.756 --> 15:32.801
Self-proclaimed.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.107
Look at that.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.065
Okay, we got to wetvac
the sh-- out of that.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.414
Come on, Max.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.850
Where do you want me today?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.287
I just want to
get the cabins done.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.766
I'’m heading straight in.

15:41.766 --> 15:42.942
Thank you so much.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.204
Pleasure.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.126
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not over there.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.606
It'’ll come back on us.
Put it down the sink.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.264
If he tells you not to do it
and you do it,

16:01.264 --> 16:03.658
then that'’s not
following orders.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.663
I don'’t understand.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.318
The bosun is telling you,
please don'’t do that.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.277
this guy
is a bit of a...

16:14.277 --> 16:16.105
Yo, detail that tender
a little bit more.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.151
- I tell you, it'’s finished.
- No. No.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.631
- What, no?
- It'’s not good for it.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.242
Copy.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.074
Tumi, Jack and Luka,
meet me in a crew mess

16:28.074 --> 16:29.466
for a preference sheet meeting.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.990
Okay, copy.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.124
Hey, we'’re all here, great.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.692
This is exciting for me.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.434
Does anybody know
the name Roy Orbison?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.175
- I do know the name.
- ♪ Pretty Woman

16:42.175 --> 16:43.959
- That'’s the one.
- Oh!

16:43.959 --> 16:45.656
- Is it him?
- That'’s crazy.

16:45.656 --> 16:46.657
It'’s his son.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.050
Roy Junior and Asa Orbison

16:48.050 --> 16:50.574
are thrilled to return
for their third charter

16:50.574 --> 16:51.967
with Captain Sandy.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.142
Here they come.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.798
- Roy, Roy.
- Hi.

16:56.798 --> 16:59.975
Happy times.
Happy times.

16:59.975 --> 17:03.109
I'’m gonna jump off the boat
over in that corner.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.849
Grab him.

17:04.849 --> 17:09.289
Roy Jr. and Asa will be joined
by their sons, Bo, Roy III

17:09.289 --> 17:12.379
and the newest member
of their family, Love.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.989
Roy'’s younger brother
and sister-in-law

17:13.989 --> 17:16.165
and Ehren, a.k.a. Danger,

17:16.165 --> 17:18.602
best known as one of
the crew members

17:18.602 --> 17:20.169
for the show "Jackass."

17:20.169 --> 17:22.432
I love "Jackass."

17:29.091 --> 17:32.703
So, primary requests
high chair and bassinet.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.146
In the afternoon,

17:40.146 --> 17:41.582
the guests want a
water sports wonderland.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.366
- They like to have fun.
- Yeah.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.716
And it'’s a great forecast.
Yeah. Okay, great.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.717
All right.
Thank you.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
- Cheffy.
- Hello.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.289
Hello.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.685
I didn'’t even know
how you worked.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.344
Oh, yeah. I agree.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.220
It'’s so great to be able to have
this conversation with Jack

18:11.220 --> 18:13.396
because he'’s actually
given me a chance.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.397
- All right, good.
- I'’m excited.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.398
All right, good, good.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.747
What are you looking for?

18:16.747 --> 18:18.401
- The black remover.
- Black streak remover.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.230
Yeah, we can take this one too.
Thank you so much.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.319
I'’ve been thinking about
appointing a lead deckhand.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.234
Lara has been doing
a very good job.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.931
She shows quite a
lot of initiative,

18:26.931 --> 18:28.455
and Lara deserves it.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.418
I'’m also thinking Max
is definitely

18:35.418 --> 18:37.420
my first managerial challenge.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.206
Hopefully promoting her
kind of motivates Max

18:40.206 --> 18:43.165
to also see
what he should be like.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.253
Oh, my God.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.777
It'’s too early to do puzzles.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.257
I love babies.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.696
Cool.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.612
Perfect.
That'’s you, baby.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.440
My mentality going
in this charter

18:57.440 --> 18:59.790
is just positive vibes,
positive vibes.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.401
And Natalya wants to be
the boat nanny.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.619
So that'’s where
I'’m going to keep her.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.969
I just want to maintain
peace and love

19:04.969 --> 19:06.493
this whole charter, please.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.453
Ugh.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.194
Oh, my God.
It only took me 10 years.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.804
Jesus, Christmas.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.632
Good morning, Captain.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.808
- How are you?
- I feel like sh--.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.462
Have a seat.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.943
Were you vomiting?

19:21.943 --> 19:23.205
For sure.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.816
And, like, my throat
so sore that...

19:25.816 --> 19:27.470
As I back away.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.950
I think I need to see a doctor.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.518
Okay.
There'’s no doctor open today.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.911
So if you feel like you need
to go the emergency room

19:33.911 --> 19:35.652
and get checked out,
we'’ll do that.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.306
- Yeah.
- Let me work on this.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.873
Okay. Thank you.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.397
Knowing that Jess is sick,
you never know what it is.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.920
I don'’t want her
infecting the crew.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.533
I need to get her off the vessel
to go see a doctor.

19:46.533 --> 19:49.013
I hate this. I hate this.
I hate this.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.364
- I'’m going to the hospital.
- Are you?

19:51.364 --> 19:53.017
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.587
Was that your stomach?

19:57.587 --> 19:59.198
Jess, we'’re getting
you a car service

19:59.198 --> 20:02.505
to take you to the hospital
so you might want to get ready.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.028
Copy that.
I'’m ready now.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.160
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:05.160 --> 20:07.902
- Let me know.
- I will.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.512
Does this get any easier?

20:09.512 --> 20:12.341
Like, now I have a crew member
that'’s sick and down.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.213
At least me and
Natalya are getting along

20:14.213 --> 20:15.823
because now I need her.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.392
Coming up...

20:20.262 --> 20:21.350
We'’re----ing busy.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.047
You can'’t always
get your breaks.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.266
When we can, we will.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.528
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.277
Same plan, noon arrival,
so you guys got to work fast.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.670
Yeah, we'’re all ready to go.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.021
It is what it is.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.414
Three power queens.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.198
All crew, we'’ve got
provisions on the dock.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.504
All right, let'’s do it.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.289
Bro, don'’t do that.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.857
If you bend those and we can'’t
get them out, we'’re----ed.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.513
So cute!

20:53.513 --> 20:56.342
All crew, all crew,
in your whites now.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.651
I think when I put sh--,
I smell more.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.785
So I was thinking about
giving Lara

21:04.785 --> 21:06.482
the lead deckhand
position today.

21:06.482 --> 21:07.788
That'’s big news.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.093
I think she'’s definitely
earned it.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.530
Yeah, she'’s good.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.314
I'’m glad that Luka is
thinking like a leader

21:12.314 --> 21:14.664
and he'’s thinking about
advancement for his team.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.536
I love that he has
that mentality.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.015
I was just going
to tell her privately.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.930
- Then we can announce it.
- That'’s awesome.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.193
- Lara, Lara, Luka.
- Yeah, go ahead?

21:22.193 --> 21:24.021
Could you come up to
the sun deck, please?

21:24.021 --> 21:25.327
Copy, on my way.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.155
Should I grab a cold towel now?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.330
Yeah.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.679
'’Sup.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.333
What'’s wrong?
Am I in trouble?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.943
I think so.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.905
No, no, no, no.
I wanted to talk to you.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.036
Yeah.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.734
You'’re being----ing
smashing it.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.345
So you'’re going to
become the lead deckhand.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.086
- No, you'’re joking.
- Yeah.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.479
- No.
- Yeah.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.350
- Are you serious?
- Are you happy with that?

21:50.874 --> 21:53.703
I think you'’re----ing
smashing it.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.357
You'’re doing so well.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.446
Thank you.

21:58.752 --> 21:59.753
Wow.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.189
I was really taking aback.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.973
Like, that'’s always
been my dream.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.672
I even have a goal board,
whatever you want to call it.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.239
And on there, it was like,
I want to be lead deckhand.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.154
I'’ve lived a very rocky life.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.376
But something clicked in me
as soon as I started yachting

22:14.376 --> 22:18.380
and can'’t believe that my dreams
are literally just coming true.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.863
ing hell.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.344
I'’ll be you left hand and your
right hand man, my brother.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.171
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

22:27.171 --> 22:29.043
<i>Let'’s meet in the main salon
for the pre-charter meeting.</i>

22:29.043 --> 22:30.174
Oh.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.438
Okay, so repeat client,
great people.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.917
A lot of kids, a lot of energy.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.093
When you have kids,
it'’s very day heavy.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.443
Harder for the deck crew.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.097
Let'’s keep them safe and
show them a good time.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.708
And then you have
some news for us.

22:41.708 --> 22:45.799
Just want to congratulate
Lara for her promotion.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.889
What?!
Congratulations!

22:48.889 --> 22:51.108
She'’s going to be
our lead deckhand.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.545
Well deserved, honey.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.807
- Thank you.
- Well deserved.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.765
Congratulations.
Okay, let'’s go kill it.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.985
- Thank you.
- Yeah, brother.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.380
I see them.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.294
We don'’t have music, but
I can hear it in my head.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.426
There they are.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.081
- It'’s us.
- Mm-hmm, fun.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.823
The baby'’s little hats,
I am going to freak out.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.348
Can'’t think of anything worse.

23:13.348 --> 23:15.829
Hi!
They'’re getting so big.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.048
Oh, they'’re so cute.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.920
- Hi, beautiful.
- Good to see you.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.575
- So happy you'’re back.
- We'’re so happy.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.706
- Hi!
- Hey, buddy.

23:23.706 --> 23:24.794
Nice to meet you, Roy.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.448
I'’m so happy you're back.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.145
We'’re going to make this
an incredible trip for you.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.757
Tumi is our chief stew.
She'’s going to show you around.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.063
- Thank you, thank you.
- Welcome to the boat.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.544
There you go.
This is non-alcoholic.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.850
Yeah, let'’s get the luggage.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.939
- Are you ready for the tour?
- Oh, yeah!

23:38.939 --> 23:41.811
- Whoa, wait a little, boys.
- This is where the fun happens.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.813
This is where the jacuzzi is.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.337
Who'’s going in this
swimming pool with Daddy?

23:46.337 --> 23:48.992
Let'’s go, Daddy.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.342
I'’ll take this.
It'’s delicate.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.344
This is the master cabin.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.259
Don'’t hit your head on
the ceiling, buddy.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.609
Just put it there at the door.

23:56.609 --> 23:57.784
So I put it at the door.

23:57.784 --> 23:58.785
Yeah, and then we
all take it in.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.177
Here'’s the twin.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.397
We'’re brothers.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.833
I know, but this
is a twin room.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.618
Because it'’s got twin beds.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.229
Let me and you do
the passarelle railings.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.231
Okay, off.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.588
Whoo!

24:29.032 --> 24:30.381
- Do you know how to open this?
- Yeah.

24:30.381 --> 24:31.644
Great.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.210
Do you want to come
see Captain Sandy?

24:35.996 --> 24:38.520
Okay, you got the pilot
approaching your starboard side.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.522
So, tonight dinner
with you guys?

24:40.522 --> 24:41.523
Yes!

24:41.523 --> 24:42.698
We just got the pilot on board,

24:42.698 --> 24:44.134
so I'’ll see you
a little later on.

24:44.134 --> 24:47.050
If you can get changed
real quick.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.052
We can start the main engines.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.708
We do have apple juice.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.102
Congrats on getting it, dude.
I knew you would.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.497
When she makes the call,

24:58.497 --> 25:01.108
we'’re just going to go all
of them at the same time.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.240
Luka, me and Haleigh,
we'’re on the bow, ready.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.546
Let'’s re-up the lines.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.243
Releasing our port
ground line.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.857
Yes, grazia, signore.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.163
All ground lines are off
the deck.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.339
Sandy, that'’s all lines
on board.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.603
Oh, look at that guy backing
into here.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
You got five meters
on your stern.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.737
Oh, here we go.
We'’re moving.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.217
I was tripping
for a second, dude.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.697
I didn'’t want to say anything.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.438
But I was like,
he'’s not backing in.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.702
Go and start bringing
in those big fenders.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.181
- Yeah, copy that.
- Thank you very much.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.054
Thank you.
Good job. Thank you.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.446
I'’ll stay with these two.

25:35.446 --> 25:36.622
Okay, thank you.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.407
Let'’s go here. Kyle.
This way.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.452
<i>Kyle, Kyle.
What'’s your location?</i>

25:41.452 --> 25:42.628
Where are you?

25:42.628 --> 25:45.108
In the Bridge Deck Salon.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.110
<i>Thanks. I'’ll be there now.
Give me two seconds.</i>

25:47.110 --> 25:49.156
Shh, shh, shh.
He'’s coming up here.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.941
Shh, shh, shh.

25:51.941 --> 25:52.768
Kyle!

25:52.768 --> 25:54.335
I saw you.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.684
Go, go, go, go.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.251
Here you go.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.775
Sandy, that'’s the pilot off
and the pilot boat away.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.081
Thank you.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.387
Yeah, get him.
He hurt me. Go.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.606
Oh, gosh.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.912
Chill out for
half an hour then

26:05.912 --> 26:07.130
we'’re going to help
the interior.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.349
Copy that.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.785
Roy, what time do you
want to do dinner?

26:09.785 --> 26:10.917
Kids go to bed early.

26:10.917 --> 26:11.961
For dinner?
Like 6:30.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.310
6:30 is dinner. Okay.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.312
Look, look.
We'’re going fast now.

26:15.312 --> 26:16.357
Woo.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.445
Hi, girl.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.968
Laundry is on rotation.

26:18.968 --> 26:19.969
Perfect.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.016
I love seeing her
enjoy herself.

26:23.016 --> 26:26.628
I have been an au pair
and that'’s not easy.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.630
So I'’ll come back and rotate
the laundry and then I'’ll...

26:28.630 --> 26:30.850
Bye. Have fun.

26:32.286 --> 26:35.071
These kids, they locked me
in the garage

26:35.071 --> 26:38.466
threw an iPad at my face
when I was driving.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.164
Screaming at me, telling me
let'’s go back to Africa.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.298
This was an
African-American house.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.996
I told them please take African
out of African-American

26:46.996 --> 26:51.174
because this is
not how we act.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.349
This is why I see
other people'’s kids

26:52.349 --> 26:54.700
and I'’m like, don't you dare.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.745
Last one to the
jet skis is a kayaker.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.181
- Cheffy.
- Hi.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.530
We'’re going to do
half past six dinner.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.880
Okay, perfect.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.752
Deck crew, deck crew,
prepare to drop anchor.

27:03.752 --> 27:04.927
So you'’re going to be with me.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.146
These guys are on
the inflatable.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.801
After the anchor manual,
do the jet skis.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.020
- And then the slide.
- And the slide.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.022
Yeah.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.982
Being lead if I can get
Max to be more motivated

27:15.982 --> 27:17.505
and actually pull his weight,

27:17.505 --> 27:20.464
I know Luka would
appreciate that a lot.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.379
I feel like that'’s a really
good way to show Luka

27:22.379 --> 27:23.990
that I'’m
taking this seriously

27:23.990 --> 27:25.600
and I'’m going to do
a good job with it.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.949
Drop anchor.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.647
We will have three shackles
in the water.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.258
So we'’re going to go
down and change.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.695
I need to jump in,
I'’m sweating so bad.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.915
You already got a
dock in the water.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.309
I'’m going to start
launching a jet ski.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.660
Nat, Tumi, Nat, Tumi,
I'’m going to go down to break.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.878
Copy.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.054
Okay, coming up.
Keep it nice and tight.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.274
Lara, Lara, Luka.
Coming down.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.493
Try and stop that swing, bro.
Hold the tension.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.844
These are so cute.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.759
Sweet.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.892
What are you doing, bro?
Don'’t do that.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.372
Let'’s go, let's go, let'’s go.

27:58.372 --> 28:03.246
Okay. Come on.
Start inflating it.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.552
All right,
keep inflating it, bro.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.729
Yeah, yeah, keep going.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.035
Stop talking.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.099
Good boy.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.493
Yeah.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.147
Okay, we'’ll keep an
eye on you guys.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.539
Okay.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.106
Okay, so-- Mercy, Mercy.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.325
Oh, God!

28:38.325 --> 28:39.674
That was more treacherous
than I thought.

28:39.674 --> 28:40.936
Okay, let'’s go.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.546
Where do you want to go, Bo?

28:42.546 --> 28:44.766
I want to go there.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.941
Mama'’s got to blow off steam.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.160
Oh, hey, look at that.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.466
Who'’s ready to party?

28:52.513 --> 28:54.341
Woo-hoo!

28:58.214 --> 29:00.086
Woo!

29:00.086 --> 29:01.478
How'’s the slide looking?

29:01.478 --> 29:03.350
Soap, all good.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.657
We'’ll be fine.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.964
You'’ll deal with the guests
whilst I deal with this table.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.357
- Lovely.
- Go!

29:13.795 --> 29:15.884
You just want to go like
have a chill for a bit.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.103
We'’ll rotate.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.147
How long do you want
me gone?

29:18.147 --> 29:19.932
Just until I come get you.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.151
Yeah, I know when your break is.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.152
Yeah.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.197
- We'’re----ing busy, so.
- Yeah.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.807
Haleigh'’s down at the moment.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.114
You can'’t always get
your breaks when you need it.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.811
I don'’t think he realizes that.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.292
Some days you'’re not going
to get a----ing break, bro.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.946
Like, you need
to put in the work.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.035
This trip is going
to be very hectic on us.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.732
We may not get our
breaks some days.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.690
But when we can, we will.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.953
Yeah, yeah.

29:46.393 --> 29:47.394
Coming up...

29:49.352 --> 29:50.832
Okay.
Pull it super tight.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.312
Okay!

29:53.704 --> 29:55.184
Hold the tension.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.273
If that thing hits you,
you will die.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.884
Max!

30:01.582 --> 30:03.627
Okay, team, let'’s go.

30:03.627 --> 30:04.890
You want a towel? Okay.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.717
That looks pretty.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.852
Still and sparkling jug.

30:10.852 --> 30:11.897
What time is dinner?

30:11.897 --> 30:13.594
6:30, I believe?

30:13.594 --> 30:16.075
Italiano.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.816
- Are you joining for dinner?
- I am.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.121
Exciting.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.952
Cute. AF.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.736
Do you want these glasses here?

30:25.736 --> 30:26.912
Thank you.
Yes, please.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.130
This, this is magnificent.

30:30.654 --> 30:31.612
- You ready?
- Yeah.

30:31.612 --> 30:32.787
Okay, let'’s go.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.441
Woo!
It'’s a little windy out there.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.312
Hi, you'’re looking dapper
and sharp.

30:36.312 --> 30:39.272
I'’m gonna sit by you,
is that okay?

30:39.272 --> 30:40.926
When'’s Kyle back?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.710
He should be back now.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.625
I'’m gonna check on Kyle,
because I think he'’s sleeping.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.105
Okay, let me go get Kyle.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.455
Tell him to get his ass up.

30:48.455 --> 30:51.806
Max, Max, Luka, can you please
come to the swim platform?

30:51.806 --> 30:53.112
Copy.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.899
I'’m going
to take on those cabins.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.161
Okay.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.382
<i>Tumi, Tumi, that'’s Kyle
on his way up.</i>

31:02.382 --> 31:03.426
I'’m probably gonna call
for starters

31:03.426 --> 31:04.819
once I'’ve put down the bread.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.516
Cheers!

31:06.516 --> 31:09.345
I wanna know what it'’s like
to be a stunt person.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.304
If I know we'’re gonna
start filming a movie,

31:11.304 --> 31:14.133
I'’m preparing myself
to die for six months before.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.612
Oh, my God!

31:15.612 --> 31:18.441
Cheffy, say this to me so
I say it properly.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.878
- Fricassee.
- Fricassee.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.531
Yeah.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.665
You know, I don'’t know how
to, how to,

31:24.665 --> 31:25.927
how to attack that.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.276
Do you think they'’re
liking the starters?

31:27.276 --> 31:28.974
Yeah, they like it.
It seems good.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.801
I don'’t remember there being a
happy meal with octopus in it.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.763
No, I'’ll do noodles and
something fancy for the parents.

31:37.634 --> 31:41.334
I broke my neck
twice in "Jackass 2."

31:41.334 --> 31:42.857
You broke your neck!

31:42.857 --> 31:44.990
In this last one, I ruptured
my right testicle.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.208
- No, no.
- Let'’s not talk about that.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.731
- No, no.
- This is real stuff.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.172
Talya.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.177
We'’re down a person
in the interior,

31:58.177 --> 31:59.743
but to be honest,
you would never know it.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.137
- Beautiful.
- These are ready.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.747
Between Kyle and
me and Tumi,

32:03.747 --> 32:06.185
we'’ve got like three people
with chief stew experience.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.883
Bam, bam.
Bam, bam.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.798
As long as everyone'’s
not----ing fighting,

32:10.798 --> 32:12.626
we are a bit of a dream team.

32:12.626 --> 32:13.844
Oh, Nummy.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.804
I see the fat.
That'’s my favorite part.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.197
I'’ll leave you a bit,
don'’t worry.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.329
Yeah!
Thank you!

32:20.329 --> 32:22.157
You'’re gonna get, we're
gonna lift the jet skis.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.203
Sure.

32:24.203 --> 32:27.075
Thank you so much. Delicious.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.294
For the veggies,

32:28.294 --> 32:30.731
you have a homemade
truffle gnocchi

32:30.731 --> 32:32.733
with wild mushrooms.

32:32.733 --> 32:33.647
Mm-hmm.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.257
And then, for the meat eaters,

32:35.257 --> 32:37.477
you have wagyu beef.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.565
Mm.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.219
And the kid'’s all veggie.

32:40.219 --> 32:42.047
Yum, yum.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.526
It'’s just a lot of swell, bro.

32:43.526 --> 32:46.486
I think you need to jump in
and just connect.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.185
, what are you doing?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.231
If you disconnect the carabineer,

32:52.231 --> 32:53.972
leave it on the line.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.756
Don'’t leave it on the skip.

32:55.756 --> 32:56.800
Okay.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.639
Ah, a choo-choo?

33:09.639 --> 33:11.337
- Choo-choo train?
- I love that.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.125
Wow, that'’s so loud.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.171
These are ready to go.

33:21.477 --> 33:24.785
Tell the chef
the flavors were incredible.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.482
How'’s it going?

33:26.482 --> 33:27.962
Yay!

33:30.269 --> 33:32.445
Captain Jock Sparrow.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.534
What would you like to
tell us about this dessert?

33:34.534 --> 33:35.796
It'’s just classic tiramisu.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.277
Cake in a cup
with some pudding stuff.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.887
- This is delightful.
- All right, cool.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.019
All right, thanks, guys.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.803
- Wow.
- Yeah. He nailed that.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.239
- Cheffy!
- Yep.

33:44.239 --> 33:48.461
Your flavors were amazing
from Captain Sandy.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.462
Yes.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.985
- Well done.
- Yes, thank you.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.639
I'’m probably being a little
biased towards Tumi,

33:52.639 --> 33:54.467
just because of
everything that'’s happened

33:54.467 --> 33:55.946
with her and Natalya
and the way things have gone.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.471
I will actively try and
avoid that in the future.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.820
I think we make a good team.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.956
Oh, my God.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.132
Oh, yeah.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.091
Oh, sh--, but
this thing is swinging.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.745
- Whoa.
- Yep.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.529
Step back, please.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.097
You know how to play Go Fish?

34:16.097 --> 34:17.707
I do.
Can we play tomorrow?

34:17.707 --> 34:18.839
Yeah.

34:18.839 --> 34:19.970
Because I have to
go to the bridge.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.845
The weather'’s----ing
turning real quick.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.673
It'’s actually getting
quite rough.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.501
I'’m thinking we've got to
get the tender on board

34:28.501 --> 34:30.242
as soon as possible.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.766
Okay, lines.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.292
Yeah, yeah.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.511
Let'’s not worry about that.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.860
They do what they need to do.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.296
Okay, coming up.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.863
Pull it super tight.

34:42.863 --> 34:44.517
Okay. Ah!

34:46.214 --> 34:48.347
Max, hold the tension.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.655
That'’s a big----ing tender.

34:52.655 --> 34:56.355
And that crane holding that,
and it'’s just no.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.487
I haven'’t seen something
like this before.

34:58.487 --> 35:02.230
Like, if that thing hits you,
you will die.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.499
Okay, hold then tension.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.112
- Okay, hold it now.
- Tight!

35:14.112 --> 35:15.765
Oh, be careful, be careful.

35:15.765 --> 35:18.203
You all right?

35:18.203 --> 35:20.466
Yeah, I'’m okay.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.165
Just try to stop that
swing out there, Max.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.732
Whoa!

35:25.732 --> 35:27.690
See,----ing was
moving down there.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.735
Yeah!

35:33.653 --> 35:36.395
You got to check with me
because there'’s a lot going on.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.484
Yeah.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.789
Luka'’s in work mode.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.313
He'’s not thinking about
the client,

35:41.313 --> 35:43.097
and that'’s an engineer
for you.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.621
They are just used to
doing the engineer thing.

35:45.621 --> 35:49.234
This is where Luka needs
to figure out

35:49.234 --> 35:51.323
the balance
of being the bosun.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.802
The guests are having dinner.

35:52.802 --> 35:55.153
Just stand by,
let the dinner finish,

35:55.153 --> 35:56.284
then load the tender.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.025
I bet he'’ll never do it again.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.287
Thanks.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.202
Here you go.
Don'’t press any buttons.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.247
- Good. Enjoy it?
- So good.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.378
The best I'’ve ever had.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.293
Oh, I'’m glad you
guys enjoyed it.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.861
Say, look at me.
I'’m the captain now.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.474
- You done it?
- Yeah.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.693
Okay, cool.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.177
Do you guys want any drinks?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.787
The boat is doing
all that for us.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.615
We are tilting to the left.
We can feel it.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.486
I am extremely surprised
that these guests

36:24.486 --> 36:26.184
are not demanding.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.098
I almost don'’t know
what to do with myself.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.710
I am a little disappointed.
I mean, we have musicians.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.190
We have the guy from "Jackass."

36:32.190 --> 36:35.541
I just want chaos.
Like, where is the my chaos?

36:35.541 --> 36:37.934
Yeah, I'’ll take
a virgin pina colada.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.809
- That'’s for real?
- No.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.420
I knew you were lying.
I knew you were lying.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.813
I'’m like, let's go play poker.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.989
I love chaos.
Just, it works for my brain.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.557
Problem solving to
bring order to the chaos.

36:51.557 --> 36:52.775
Just like my men.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.866
This is why I go
for the delinquents,

36:56.866 --> 36:58.303
because I'’m always
trying to fix them.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.739
It'’s----ing chaotic.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.569
- Have a great night.
- Good night.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.875
- Have a great night, everybody.
- See you guys tomorrow.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.137
Max, Max, Luka.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.357
You wanna meet me
on the bridge deck aft?

37:09.357 --> 37:11.359
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

37:11.359 --> 37:12.404
Can we do something dangerous?

37:12.404 --> 37:14.406
- No.
- No? Against the rules.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.885
I'’ve had 27 surgeries.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.192
I'’m, like, confused on
this relaxation stuff.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.889
Yo.

37:19.889 --> 37:23.328
Um, so I'’ll just get you to
to rinse this table and the...

37:23.328 --> 37:25.243
Okay.
You'’re going to sleep?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.374
Soon.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.376
And then you start at 8 o'’clock.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.509
This is my deal.
I give you efficiency.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.075
I finish the things, you know.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.861
And yeah, I can be in standby
and relax a bit more,

37:34.861 --> 37:37.429
because if something
happens more, I'’m ready.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.691
Daddy is ready, you know.

37:38.691 --> 37:41.302
But I am tired,
and I want more break,

37:41.302 --> 37:42.999
because I'’m working more hard.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.436
My name is Max.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.527
Good night.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.355
Do you want to touch a nipple
or something before you sleep?

37:50.355 --> 37:51.660
Real quick. Okay.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.707
No sneaking in after
the shower, okay?

37:57.144 --> 37:58.145
Good night.

38:01.322 --> 38:02.932
me.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.151
Oh, oops.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.458
Hey, babe.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.461
Huh?

38:10.853 --> 38:13.595
I thought you were just in bed.

38:13.595 --> 38:14.988
Who is the bunch of people?

38:17.338 --> 38:20.472
Boys or girls?
Boys or girls?

38:23.997 --> 38:25.781
Don'’t worry about
calling back.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.827
Yesterday, my
boyfriend said to me,

38:27.827 --> 38:30.569
"I don'’t want to influence
your night off.

38:30.569 --> 38:31.961
"Do what you need to do.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.920
"I would just hope
that doesn'’t hurt me.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.009
You really do mean
the world to me."

38:38.011 --> 38:39.752
So...

38:39.752 --> 38:41.144
Yeah, what the [bleep]?

38:46.411 --> 38:48.456
I don'’t know.
It'’s confusing.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.936
Bullsh--.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.133
I'’ll do the kid breakfast first.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.701
Hi, beautiful angel.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.705
Give him 10 minutes.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.489
Good morning.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.708
The slide is still out.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.494
Come help us with
the slide, brother.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.018
Oh, [bleep].

39:29.018 --> 39:31.412
Oh, I love it when
people are late.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.892
Well, hello.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.502
That is brilliant.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.722
Wow, it'’s the pajamas for me.

39:36.722 --> 39:37.940
The pajamas. Amazing.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.725
We came underdressed
for this party.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.291
They'’re boobjamas.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.034
<i>Natalya, Natalya.</i>

39:45.034 --> 39:46.688
Do you want to assist me
in the guest cabins?

39:46.688 --> 39:48.255
I'’m going to go down
to the cabins,

39:48.255 --> 39:50.388
but I'’ll visit
you soon, my love.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.564
Okay, let'’s start off with
a good old croissant

39:52.564 --> 39:53.869
for my bear.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.436
- Really, babes?
- Yeah.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.090
- Sleeping?
- Just woke up.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.398
I'’m pretty----ing
frustrated with Max.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.225
I'’ve given him enough sleep.

40:02.225 --> 40:04.445
- You start at 8 o'’clock.
- Okay, cool, man.

40:04.445 --> 40:05.446
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

40:05.446 --> 40:06.708
Ciao bello.

40:06.708 --> 40:07.753
Morning, you okay?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.581
Morning, yeah, morning, okay?

40:09.581 --> 40:11.234
I'’m a very quiet person.

40:11.234 --> 40:16.326
I am quite calm, but when
I do go off, then I do go off.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.198
And I'’m getting closer.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.290
Okay, got it.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.558
Tumi, I'’ve
got breakfast ready.

40:30.558 --> 40:31.777
<i>Copy, on my way.</i>

40:33.126 --> 40:34.475
How come I haven'’t
done this years ago?

40:34.475 --> 40:35.911
Why have I...
This is...

40:35.911 --> 40:37.609
How am I supposed to go home?

40:37.609 --> 40:39.393
- Grab that?
- One, two, three.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.177
Got it.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.396
Thank you.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.486
Oh, shirts, thank you.

40:45.486 --> 40:46.748
Oh, here we go.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.141
Okay, we'’ve got
great stuff here.

40:48.141 --> 40:48.924
Wow.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.143
Where I'’m going?

40:50.143 --> 40:51.318
Bring in the docks
on the stern.

40:51.318 --> 40:52.145
Then tie them off.

40:52.145 --> 40:53.668
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.322
Just make sure to
tie them off properly.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.932
How was your food?

40:56.932 --> 40:58.325
- Great.
- Amazing?

40:58.325 --> 40:59.326
Mm-hmm.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.283
Would you like some water?

41:04.026 --> 41:06.246
Tie it off there properly.

41:06.246 --> 41:08.248
Make a bowline and then
a hitch or something?

41:09.379 --> 41:11.643
But keep this tension on.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.862
Cheffy, Cheffy.
They love breakfast.

41:15.385 --> 41:16.996
- It'’s okay.
- I hope it'’s okay.

41:16.996 --> 41:20.608
Me too, brother.
Otherwise, it'’s on you.

41:20.608 --> 41:22.262
But it'’s on me, don't worry.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.016
How good is that quiche?

41:37.016 --> 41:39.279
Really good.
Okay, so anchor up at nine.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.411
Maybe you could drive us
out of the anchorage.

41:41.411 --> 41:42.412
Okay, cool.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.852
- I'’m gonna drive.
- Sick, man.

41:46.852 --> 41:47.853
Oh, it'’s a bee.
It'’s a real bee.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.202
Look at the bee.

41:49.202 --> 41:51.073
Oh, it came for the Nutella
and the honey.

41:51.073 --> 41:53.249
Oh, it'’s coming to daddy.
Oh! Oh!

41:53.249 --> 41:54.686
Come over here,
I want to teach you this.

41:54.686 --> 41:55.687
You'’re gonna lie like this.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.079
Yeah.

41:57.079 --> 41:58.777
So that you can move
your head towards me.

41:58.777 --> 42:01.344
- So, hit command.
- Command.

42:01.344 --> 42:04.043
12 o'’clock, one o'clock,
two o'’clock, three o'clock.

42:04.043 --> 42:06.045
At the moment,
it'’s three o'clock.

42:06.045 --> 42:09.178
- That'’s in control now.
- That'’s correct.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.397
You know you'’re
doing a good job.

42:10.397 --> 42:11.877
Thank you, Sandy.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.751
Three and a half. Why?

42:18.623 --> 42:19.841
Okay, I'’m gonna leave you.

42:19.841 --> 42:21.234
You'’re gonna leave me.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.932
Don'’t ask me how much
experience I have.

42:23.932 --> 42:25.847
You say you know sh--,
but you don'’t.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.067
It'’s all right, bro.
Come on, now.

42:28.067 --> 42:30.504
No, it wasn'’t okay.
The communication was wrong.

42:30.504 --> 42:31.897
Yeah, communication was wrong.
This I know.

42:31.897 --> 42:33.594
Is he okay?

42:33.594 --> 42:34.682
What are you on about, mate?

42:34.682 --> 42:36.423
So what is your goal here?

42:36.423 --> 42:39.513
Let'’s not like fight
in front of the captain.

42:39.513 --> 42:41.210
Your attitude stinks, honestly.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.690
They can start
hauling the anchor.

42:42.690 --> 42:45.606
Lara, you guys
can start hauling.

42:45.606 --> 42:46.912
Thank you.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.046
Calm down. Honestly.

42:51.046 --> 42:52.744
I don'’t give a sh--.
Let'’s just do the anchoring.

42:52.744 --> 42:54.093
So see how the swell
is picking us up?

42:54.093 --> 42:55.355
Yeah.

42:55.355 --> 42:57.444
I would put one engine
astern to stop that.

42:57.444 --> 43:00.273
But I'’m just making sure
you know what we'’re gonna do.

43:00.273 --> 43:02.841
She'’s moving.
She'’s using the boat.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.538
- Yeah, but what side?
- She'’s spinning.

43:04.538 --> 43:07.062
What are they saying?
Are they arguing?

43:07.062 --> 43:08.455
- You stop to move the cable.
- Concentrate.

43:08.455 --> 43:10.544
Lara, can you relay
what he'’s saying?

43:10.544 --> 43:11.806
Communication sucks.

43:11.806 --> 43:13.460
Hey, what'’s going on?

43:13.460 --> 43:15.897
Deck crew'’s communication
has to be clear and concise.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.507
It'’s a----ing safety issue.

43:17.507 --> 43:19.901
You. Stop arguing.

43:19.901 --> 43:21.729
- Okay, now we'’re good.
- No, you need to move.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.557
- Okay, okay.
- That is not okay.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.994
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:25.994 --> 43:28.518
Oh, my gosh!

43:28.518 --> 43:30.520
- What is...
- No! Oh, oh!

43:30.520 --> 43:31.826
Okay, that'’s enough.
That'’s enough.

43:31.826 --> 43:34.220
- Kyle lounging again.
- Dude!

43:34.220 --> 43:36.265
What?

43:39.965 --> 43:41.575
if he'’s talking sh-- about her,

43:41.575 --> 43:43.969
he'’s definitely
talking sh-- about me.

43:43.969 --> 43:46.493
Max, Max, Luka. Max.

43:46.493 --> 43:48.277
The gap looks smaller
than the boat.

43:48.277 --> 43:49.670
We'’re going in between
these two right here.

43:49.670 --> 43:51.150
Okay, copy.

43:51.150 --> 43:52.542
I'’m----ing stressed now,
that'’s for sure.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.327
Max, Max.

43:54.327 --> 43:56.677
Are you getting a bit of
a semi there, babe?

43:56.677 --> 43:57.939
Kiss right now!

43:57.939 --> 43:59.506
Stop being stupid!

43:59.506 --> 44:01.290
This is something I would
normally, like, full on date

44:01.290 --> 44:02.857
and be, like, meet my parents.
