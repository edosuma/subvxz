00:15.932 --> 00:17.475
<i>Another world.</i>

00:18.059 --> 00:21.438
<i>Another time. Another age.</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:23.565
<i>Thra...</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:27.527
<i>a wondrous planet circling three suns.</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:31.531
<i>And at its center, the Crystal of Truth,</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:35.869
<i>the heart of Thra</i>
<i>and the source of all life.</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:41.082
<i>Since the land was young,</i>
<i>Aughra protected the Crystal...</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:43.126
<i>for she knew that the Crystal...</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:46.046
<i>...connected all the creatures of Thra.</i>

00:47.088 --> 00:50.884
<i>But closest to her heart</i>
<i>were the Gelfling.</i>

00:51.676 --> 00:55.472
<i>Seven clans of Gelfling call Thra home.</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:00.560
<i>From the proud Vapra</i>
<i>in the mountain city of Ha'rar...</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:03.521
<i>the most cultured of the Gelfling, </i>

01:04.064 --> 01:06.566
<i>who rule over the Seven Clans...</i>

01:09.944 --> 01:11.780
<i>to the fierce Stonewood, </i>

01:12.280 --> 01:15.033
<i>who dwell in the Endless Forest,</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:18.369
<i>renowned for their prowess in battle...</i>

01:22.665 --> 01:24.876
<i>and the gentle Grottan,</i>

01:25.543 --> 01:28.213
<i>who live deep beneath the ground...</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:32.425
<i>in perfect harmony with all of Thra,</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:36.179
<i>forgotten by the world above.</i>

01:38.014 --> 01:43.812
<i>For uncounted millennia,</i>
<i>all of Thra existed in perfect balance.</i>

01:44.729 --> 01:48.024
<i>But then, new beings came, </i>

01:48.108 --> 01:49.943
<i>not of Thra.</i>

01:51.236 --> 01:52.612
<i>The Skeksis.</i>

01:53.863 --> 01:57.617
<i>They bewitched Aughra</i>
<i>with stories of the Universe </i>

01:57.700 --> 01:59.452
<i>and built her an orrery...</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:05.083
<i>so that she might discover the mysteries</i>
<i>of the Cosmos for herself.</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:10.296
<i>And so, Aughra turned her eye</i>
<i>to the stars...</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:20.265
<i>and entrusted the Crystal of Truth...</i>

02:21.307 --> 02:22.976
<i>to the Skeksis.</i>

02:30.358 --> 02:32.694
<i>Almost a thousand trine have passed </i>

02:32.777 --> 02:36.281
<i>since the Skeksis declared themselves</i>
<i>Lords of Thra.</i>

02:41.953 --> 02:44.164
<i>Now, once again, </i>

02:44.497 --> 02:47.041
<i>the Skeksis gather in secret </i>

02:47.625 --> 02:49.794
<i>as another day dawns...</i>

02:52.714 --> 02:57.635
<i>to steal life from the Crystal</i>
<i>they have sworn to protect.</i>

03:02.473 --> 03:03.850
Ahh!

03:04.684 --> 03:07.979
<i>So they may replenish themselves. </i>

03:08.897 --> 03:10.773
<i>Cheat death...</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:12.984
<i>-...by harnessing the power</i>

03:13.067 --> 03:14.277
<i>of their treasure.</i>

03:15.069 --> 03:16.362
<i>Their prize. </i>

03:17.280 --> 03:18.781
<i>Their prisoner.</i>

03:20.283 --> 03:22.076
<i>The Dark Crystal.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:31.794
-Hm?

03:33.379 --> 03:35.548
The Crystal fails us once again.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.092
Well, what did you expect?

03:38.301 --> 03:42.222
Nothing yesterday, nothing the day before.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.141
Why? Why does this happen?

03:45.225 --> 03:49.687
Just look at the Crystal!
We've taken too much! Ha!

03:50.146 --> 03:51.856
It's gluttony!

03:51.940 --> 03:54.609
Pure gluttony! Oh...

03:54.984 --> 03:56.903
- Pathetic!
-Huh?

03:56.986 --> 03:59.155
You sound like frightened Podlings.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.991
But, Emperor,
if the Crystal will not give,

04:02.325 --> 04:03.743
we will die.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.370
-Die! Die!

04:05.703 --> 04:06.579
-Huh?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.747
Never!

04:08.248 --> 04:10.083
We have nothing to fear.

04:10.583 --> 04:15.755
Already a solution lies
within the Scientist's very grasp.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.174
-Is that not so?
-Uh.. uh...

04:18.633 --> 04:21.135
Our mighty Emperor speaks true.

04:21.219 --> 04:26.391
I am hard at work
on this troublesome inconvenience, yes.

04:26.516 --> 04:30.853
Patience. We are Lords of the Crystal.

04:31.312 --> 04:35.984
We have ruled for an age
and will rule for all ages yet to come.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.737
-We are eternal!
- Yes.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.240
-Eternal.
-Eternal.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.950
Mm-hmm.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.868
Now, go.

04:48.037 --> 04:51.582
The Emperor is wise.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.794
Emperor, Emperor...

04:54.877 --> 04:56.504
-Emperor!
-Yes, what?

04:56.587 --> 05:00.550
I... I would not dare
question your wisdom,

05:00.883 --> 05:03.094
but you know I have found no solution.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.512
Ah.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.848
The Crystal is the heart of Thra.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.766
They are one and the same.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.936
But the more we take, the less it gives.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.063
All our survival is at stake!

05:16.316 --> 05:19.277
So, find a solution.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.405
Of course, Emperor. Forgive me.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.828
I did not build an empire

05:28.911 --> 05:31.831
only to watch it turn to dust.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.794
I will find the answer, Emperor.
You will see!

05:37.211 --> 05:42.050
I will not fail you! I will not fail you!

05:43.092 --> 05:44.552
Hmm...

06:02.236 --> 06:06.157
<i> The Gelfling know nothing</i>
<i>of the Skeksis' crimes.</i>

06:07.367 --> 06:09.410
<i>The truth must come to light.</i>

06:10.495 --> 06:13.289
<i>The fires of rebellion must be lit.</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
<i>And a new age must begin.</i>

06:27.387 --> 06:29.889
<i>The Crystal of Truth has been corrupted.</i>

06:31.224 --> 06:33.935
<i>That corruption spreads through Thra</i>

06:34.519 --> 06:36.062
<i>and into its creatures.</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:41.150
<i>Even the ones</i>
<i>locked in the Skeksis' cages,</i>

06:41.818 --> 06:42.902
<i>captives...</i>

06:48.658 --> 06:49.951
<i>...until today.</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:12.849
Uh...

07:28.072 --> 07:30.408
-Rian!
-So...

07:31.534 --> 07:32.577
hello again.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.500
-Easy, friends.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.839
It's my sworn duty as a castle guard
to keep the lords safe.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.217
-How do I know these aren't poisoned?

07:48.342 --> 07:51.137
-Well, there's only one way to find out.
-No!

07:53.639 --> 07:56.684
I'm sure the lords wouldn't mind
if a few went missing.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.937
After all, the Skeksis are generous.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.731
And you have to admit,

08:02.190 --> 08:04.066
these do look tasty.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.985
Hm...

08:06.194 --> 08:07.487
Psst. Hey.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.749
I didn't take anything! See?

08:22.627 --> 08:25.171
-You don't have to be rude.
-Mira, run!

08:25.463 --> 08:26.297
Thank you!

08:29.884 --> 08:32.512
-See you tomorrow!
- Let's get out of here.

08:36.891 --> 08:40.603
-Did you see those Podlings' faces?
- It's almost too easy.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.854
They never seem to learn.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.484
-Race you to the Spy Glass!
-Last one there's a flat-footed Nebrie!

08:53.574 --> 08:54.492
Uh...

08:56.577 --> 08:58.120
Huh?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.381
Made it.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.260
-Hello!

09:14.595 --> 09:18.182
-There you are. I was afraid you got lost.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.102
-You cheated.
-I win again.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.980
You won because you have wings.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.982
Course I do. I'm a girl.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.151
-And you're a flat-footed Nebrie.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.833
Do you remember
the first time we came up here?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.586
How could I forget?

09:47.128 --> 09:47.962
Show me.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.132
You mean... dreamfast?

09:51.215 --> 09:52.758
Yes! I mean...

09:53.467 --> 09:54.594
if you wanted to.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.598
-Well, uh... I do if you do.
-Yes.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.975
-I want to dreamfast.
-Oh, good.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.685
I do too.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.907
<i>I remember everything about that night.</i>

10:17.575 --> 10:19.410
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

10:19.660 --> 10:20.786
<i>I could tell.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:25.041
<i> I used every trick I had</i>
<i>to try and impress you.</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:27.710
- <i>You certainly did try.</i>

10:28.210 --> 10:31.839
<i> I was distracted.</i>
<i>All I could think about was kissing you.</i>

10:32.882 --> 10:34.717
<i>And I got sick of waiting.</i>

10:35.885 --> 10:37.136
<i>So I kissed you.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:44.769
-Mira!
-Wait, what--

10:44.852 --> 10:46.062
Must've snuck in.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.858
An Arathim soldier
wouldn't risk entering the castle.

10:50.983 --> 10:51.901
Well, that one is!

10:51.984 --> 10:54.153
Then we have to tell the captain.
Come on.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.743
Remember your oath.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.912
We protect the lords.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.289
The lords protect the Crystal.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.626
When one of us fails in our duty,
we all fail!

11:08.709 --> 11:10.294
By the Crystal!

11:11.253 --> 11:12.338
Positions!

11:13.756 --> 11:15.716
Another trine,

11:15.966 --> 11:19.220
another wretched carriage ride to Ha'rar,

11:19.804 --> 11:23.891
another interminable tithing ceremony.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.060
I enjoy the Gelfling capital.

11:26.268 --> 11:30.648
I think it possesses
a certain malodorous charm.

11:31.941 --> 11:37.071
Oh, that mountain air
plays havoc with my pustules.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.532
Well, I have read of a Grottan potus

11:39.615 --> 11:41.534
that might offer some relief.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.743
- It's pointless.
-Shoo! Shoo!

11:42.827 --> 11:45.496
-They always come back.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.250
Always!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.419
Oh, dear.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.004
- Bring in the Armaligs!
-That was a long one.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.636
- Get a move on!

12:08.352 --> 12:10.104
Secure that Landstrider!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.898
- Load up the weapons!
- Secure the harness!

12:16.944 --> 12:19.029
-Captain Ordon!
-We need to talk to you.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.489
It can wait.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.827
Plans have changed. I will now escort
the lords to Ha'rar personally.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.745
-Huh?
-You're leaving?

12:25.911 --> 12:26.787
Mm-hm.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.331
Then you need a Gelfling
to lead the guard while you're gone!

12:29.415 --> 12:32.251
Yes. A Gelfling who has excelled
in all the drills.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.296
A Gelfling who has spent his whole life
in the castle.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.381
A Gelfling who respects tradition.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.800
-That's why I chose Tolyn.
- Huh?

12:39.884 --> 12:40.760
Tolyn?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.053
-Really?
-Hm...

12:44.680 --> 12:45.806
But I'm ready!

12:45.973 --> 12:47.558
It's a job for a soldier,

12:47.641 --> 12:51.145
not childlings who steal treats
when they should be on patrol.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.730
-Tattletales.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.485
-That was just a bit of fun.
-That's all it ever is with you.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.654
Perhaps one day you'll prove worthy
of taking up my mantle.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.615
-But, Father--
-Captain.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.660
Yes, Captain.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.747
- What's the hold up?

13:11.415 --> 13:14.001
Ah... the second brother is in its zenith.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.879
Let us be gone!

13:16.962 --> 13:18.714
Yes. Saddle up!

13:18.798 --> 13:21.008
Captain Ordon, please.
Before you go...

13:21.091 --> 13:23.052
So, we saw...

13:23.135 --> 13:24.804
What did you see? Make it quick.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.180
Uh...

13:26.430 --> 13:28.098
-Uh...
-Go on. Tell him, Rian.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.101
It can wait.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.895
Safe travels, Captain.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.855
Remember your oath.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.609
Ready the captain's Landstrider!

13:43.572 --> 13:45.950
The lords are due in Ha'rar by sundown.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.451
We march!

13:47.535 --> 13:48.994
-Hiyah!

13:58.128 --> 14:00.089
Come on! Come on!

14:30.786 --> 14:31.662
I'm sorry, Rian.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.455
That's all right.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.166
Why didn't you tell him about the Spitter?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.294
Since the day I was born,

14:38.377 --> 14:40.504
I've had to listen
to stories of my father.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.215
Ordon, hero of Stone-in-the-Wood.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.551
Ordon the Spitter Slayer?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.886
I think it's past time

14:46.969 --> 14:50.598
my father had to listen
to a few stories about his son.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
You want to go Spitter hunting?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.186
Well, how else can I prove myself
to the Great Ordon, eh?

14:58.439 --> 14:59.940
Settle down.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.192
Care to join me?

15:03.319 --> 15:07.197
Of course.
But we're going to need some help.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.161
Have you tried these? They're fantastic.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.621
Hm...

15:14.413 --> 15:15.289
Gurjin.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.665
Sure.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.086
-How's my best friend today?
-What? What? What do you want?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.973
Where is that book? Agh.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.976
Mm, mm,
must be around here somewhere.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.437
-Ah! There it is!

15:38.771 --> 15:42.399
No, that's not it.
Just a moment, Princess!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.493
Hm...

16:32.199 --> 16:35.077
Here's the rest of the materials
you requested, Princess.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.287
Oh, thank you.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.168
Did... did, did you find
<i>Grillo's Lexicon of Lesser Astrography?</i>

16:45.421 --> 16:47.923
-I shall return.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.010
-Thank you!

16:52.469 --> 16:55.264
What are you doing? No!
Don't touch that! No, don't!

16:57.057 --> 16:59.143
-Princess Tavra...

16:59.268 --> 17:01.228
Yes, you better run, creature.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.232
-There you are, little sister.
-Oh, Tavra. Come look.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.567
It's Mother Aughra.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.321
And I discovered some facts
about swamp roots.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.614
You're going to love this.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.743
Did you know that tug noot
causes explosive belching?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
-I have news for you, Brea.
-Hm?

17:19.163 --> 17:23.000
I convinced Mother to let you attend
the tithing ceremony.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.589
-You're having fun with me.
-You know I never have fun.

17:29.965 --> 17:33.552
Oh, this is fantastic!
Will I get to talk to the Skeksis?

17:33.635 --> 17:37.056
-I have so many questions!
-Oh, the lords don't like questions.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.976
Oh! Why don't they like questions?
How else do we learn?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.936
Now I have more questions.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.481
Oh, Brea, don't embarrass me this time.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.192
I won't. I promise.

17:48.275 --> 17:52.029
You have so much ink on your face.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.906
Now, come.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.075
-We can't be late.
-Ah.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.246
Maybe just one question.

18:12.007 --> 18:17.346
<i>♪ Far from the brothers' blinding light ♪</i>

18:17.471 --> 18:24.061
<i>-♪ Beneath the blanket of the long night ♪</i>

18:24.812 --> 18:30.109
<i>♪ Grottans work in the dark and deep ♪</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:32.903
<i>♪ Where the glow moss grows ♪</i>

18:32.986 --> 18:37.157
<i>♪ And there crawlies creep ♪</i>

18:50.879 --> 18:52.339
Woo!

19:02.432 --> 19:03.684
Look! Deet!

19:04.518 --> 19:05.727
Oh, hi, family!

19:05.811 --> 19:08.313
-Deet, Deet, Deet, Deet!

19:08.897 --> 19:11.942
Hello, Nurlocs! It's feeding time!

19:23.245 --> 19:26.165
I'll see you tomorrow!
And remember to share!

19:37.384 --> 19:39.052
I hear you, baby!

19:46.476 --> 19:47.311
Hello.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.981
-Hungry?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.276
-Look, some delicious moss.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.698
There you go.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.953
Don't eat too fast. Chew your food.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.711
-What's got into you?

20:13.378 --> 20:15.380
How about I return
when you're feeling better?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.550
Oh, my wing!

20:50.249 --> 20:51.208
-Excuse us.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.918
-Excuse us. Sorry.
-Will you keep moving?

20:53.001 --> 20:55.003
- We have to hurry.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.713
Mother wants us by her side...

20:56.838 --> 20:59.091
-when the Skeksis arrive.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.010
They're here!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.972
We're going to be late.
Unless we get to the...

21:05.931 --> 21:06.932
Brea?

21:07.849 --> 21:09.518
Brea!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.687
-Excuse me. Pardon me, please.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.939
- Oh, they're coming!
- Here they come!

21:14.022 --> 21:15.440
-Please, pardon me.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.067
Mind where you're going, child!

21:17.150 --> 21:18.193
I beg your pardon.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.785
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Thank you. If I could just...

21:26.868 --> 21:27.786
Excuse me.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.579
Oh, excuse me!

21:35.585 --> 21:36.503
Oh...

21:43.844 --> 21:45.470
Whoa!

21:48.307 --> 21:51.560
Why have we stopped?
What is the meaning of...

21:52.019 --> 21:52.853
Oh...

21:53.937 --> 21:55.981
Watch yourself, Gelfling.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.192
Little things have a habit
of being stepped on by...

21:59.943 --> 22:01.403
big things.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.407
My lord, no need to trouble yourself.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.701
I will see the girl safely home.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.202
-Hm.
- There. Do you see?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.122
- The lords saved her.
- Which princess?

22:12.205 --> 22:13.707
- Such chivalry!
- It's Princess Brea.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.709
- The little one, Brea!
- Our princess is safe!

22:16.168 --> 22:18.211
A princess?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.172
Yes, my lord.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.592
I am Brea,
youngest daughter of the All-Maudra.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.470
You are a princess.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.848
Your mother
has been of great service to us.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.642
You must allow us
to escort you to the citadel.

22:33.226 --> 22:37.064
It would be our pleasure.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.024
Uh...

22:39.107 --> 22:40.734
Thank you, my lord, but--

22:40.817 --> 22:43.945
Uh-uh! I insist. Come!

22:45.489 --> 22:46.990
-Come.
-Ooh!

22:47.324 --> 22:48.992
-Lucky child!
-She's getting in the carriage.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.161
-To ride with the lords! Look at that.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.496
- On our way, then!
-Mm-hmm.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.830
Not a moment to lose!

22:55.374 --> 22:59.586
Look, skekLach.
We have a princess in our carriage.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.464
-Oh...

23:02.756 --> 23:04.716
I'm not much of a princess, my lord.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.385
-Hmm.
- Not like my sisters.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.053
Tavra's a great warrior,

23:08.136 --> 23:09.846
and Seladon is the eldest,

23:09.930 --> 23:13.683
-so she'll be All-Maudra one day.
-Blah, blah! Proceed!

23:35.914 --> 23:37.958
What's that on your cheek?

23:38.041 --> 23:39.459
Ink, my lord.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.045
I keep a journal
where I record all that I learn.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.423
So you can read.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.299
Oh, how wonderful!

23:46.758 --> 23:48.260
Did you hear that, skekLach?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.847
She can read and write.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.225
I too am a connoisseur
of the written word.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.937
I am the Scroll-Keeper.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.524
-I've read all about you!

24:02.607 --> 24:05.777
You're in charge of the Great Library
at the Castle of the Crystal!

24:06.153 --> 24:08.697
Hm...
I see you've done your research.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.075
- Is it a big library?
- Simple childling!

24:12.159 --> 24:13.994
-It is endless.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.705
I have tomes
that go back a thousand trine.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.707
Hm...

24:18.832 --> 24:20.208
Could I visit your library?

24:20.292 --> 24:21.418
No!

24:21.501 --> 24:25.005
That knowledge is forbidden.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.257
But... why?

24:28.425 --> 24:31.470
-Do you see this face?
-Uh-huh.

24:31.553 --> 24:36.141
-Once, this was a beautiful face.
- Um...

24:36.558 --> 24:39.394
But then came...

24:39.853 --> 24:41.730
knowledge.

24:41.813 --> 24:47.152
Oh, hush! Such rubbish.
You were never beautiful.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.614
I remember.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.201
Never.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.972
-Where's Brea?
-Well...

25:27.067 --> 25:29.361
The Keepers of the Crystal!

25:43.708 --> 25:46.962
Oh, look. There she is.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.634
The All-Maudra looks cross.

25:53.301 --> 25:56.888
Not to worry,
I will speak with her on your behalf.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.309
Hm?

26:01.476 --> 26:02.394
What?

26:02.477 --> 26:03.436
Thank you.

26:04.187 --> 26:07.399
Run along now, Princess.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.652
Away, away.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.362
Mother...

26:13.822 --> 26:14.739
Hm.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.708
-What happened to not embarrassing me?
-This time, it really wasn't my fault.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.792
Quiet.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.255
Honored lords...

26:31.047 --> 26:34.342
welcome to Ha'rar, home of the Vapra,

26:34.426 --> 26:39.014
seat of the All-Maudra
who rules over all Gelfling.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.141
- As the Emperor wisely...
-You'll definitely be sent

26:41.224 --> 26:43.184
to the Order of Lesser Service now,
sister.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.604
- We are humbled by....
-You're just jealous, Seladon.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.897
I got to ride in the lords' carriage.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.733
- ...each trine,

26:49.816 --> 26:51.067
the Seven Clans,

26:51.484 --> 26:55.405
from the fiercest Stonewood
to the lowliest Grottan,

26:55.488 --> 26:59.534
-gift unto our generous lords a tithe.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.453
As is proper,

27:01.953 --> 27:06.333
the noble Vapra hold the honor
of being the first to give.

27:08.001 --> 27:12.464
All hail the Lords of the Crystal!

27:13.548 --> 27:19.262
All hail the Skeksis!
All hail the Skeksis!

27:26.186 --> 27:28.188
Cruel, pernicious Emperor,

27:28.271 --> 27:32.192
preeminent minds are never
properly appreciated in their time.

27:33.693 --> 27:38.657
-But every problem obfuscates a solution

27:38.907 --> 27:41.785
waiting to be discovered.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.957
If the Crystal cannot draw
enough power from Thra,

27:48.416 --> 27:50.877
then I must provide it
with another source.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.045
Hm...

28:03.682 --> 28:05.558
Wonderful!

28:12.857 --> 28:14.150
Yes!

28:19.864 --> 28:20.699
Ah!

28:21.074 --> 28:23.576
Yes, yes!

28:39.968 --> 28:43.304
How very interesting.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.895
That's enough.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.607
I said enough!

28:56.651 --> 28:59.320
Cease! I command you!

29:06.077 --> 29:07.996
Oh, my, my, my!

29:08.079 --> 29:10.081
-Beloved Scientist!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.251
You must be careful.

29:13.334 --> 29:17.630
-I may not always be here to save you.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.382
The Crystal,

29:19.466 --> 29:21.217
it took hold of me.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.636
I could not stop it.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.890
I felt it draw forth my life force,

29:26.973 --> 29:30.101
my very essence.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.936
Mmm...

29:32.687 --> 29:35.815
I failed again.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.317
You need a walk.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.987
Come, we walk. You and I, yes?

29:41.529 --> 29:44.574
Perhaps a walk would be agreeable.

29:44.657 --> 29:45.784
Yes.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.292
It's too much to bear.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.921
My every experiment ends in disaster.

29:58.254 --> 30:03.176
And now, I've accidentally reversed
the Crystal's magnetostatic field.

30:03.259 --> 30:07.847
Please, small words.
Chamberlain is not smart like Scientist.

30:07.931 --> 30:11.059
Instead of giving life,
I made the Crystal take life.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.020
I will be punished grievously
for this failure.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.314
No. You found answer.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.983
You are hero. Big reward.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.986
-Huge!
-You mock me, skekSil?

30:22.070 --> 30:25.281
No, no! You make Crystal hungry.

30:25.573 --> 30:30.829
Crystal pulls out essence,
but what if we take essence for Skeksis?

30:30.912 --> 30:32.580
What if we snatch it?

30:33.623 --> 30:36.251
-Collect the essence?
-Yes!

30:36.417 --> 30:39.128
Instead of taking power
we need from Crystal,

30:39.212 --> 30:43.258
Skeksis use Crystal
to take power from essence.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.677
Hmm...
Hypothetically sound,

30:45.760 --> 30:48.721
but I will need a creature
to experiment upon.

30:49.097 --> 30:53.351
Hmm... Well, Crystal is Thra.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.186
Thra gave life.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.314
What creatures are closest to Thra, hm?

30:58.648 --> 31:01.276
Most full of essence, hmm?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.403
Hmm...

31:04.279 --> 31:05.697
Hm...

31:08.950 --> 31:10.618
Mm...

31:17.625 --> 31:20.795
-Mm?
-Mm...

31:45.737 --> 31:47.238
The Sanctuary Tree?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.950
I haven't been here since I was small.

31:51.784 --> 31:54.537
-<i> You're still small.</i>

31:55.204 --> 31:57.040
You... You can talk?

31:57.373 --> 32:00.877
<i>Only to those who can hear, Deet.</i>

32:01.586 --> 32:04.464
-You know my name?
- <i>I know much more.</i>

32:04.547 --> 32:08.051
<i>I know how you care</i>
<i>for all the creatures of Grot</i>

32:08.134 --> 32:10.762
<i>and how much they care for you.</i>

32:11.012 --> 32:13.181
Except the Nurloc that attacked me.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.099
<i> It's not her fault.</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:18.478
<i>She has been consumed by the Darkening.</i>

32:19.354 --> 32:21.189
What is the Darkening?

32:21.272 --> 32:22.941
<i>An infectious contamination</i>

32:23.024 --> 32:24.901
<i>within the Crystal of Truth</i>

32:24.984 --> 32:28.613
<i>and within Thra.</i>
<i>For they are one and the same.</i>

32:29.030 --> 32:30.698
<i>For a thousand trine, </i>

32:30.782 --> 32:34.619
<i>we, the Great Trees, have kept it</i>
<i>contained beneath the ground.</i>

32:34.744 --> 32:36.454
<i>But we are losing our battle.</i>

32:36.537 --> 32:39.540
<i>Even now, it spreads to the world above.</i>

32:39.624 --> 32:43.127
<i>You must warn the Gelfling,</i>
<i>rally them to our cause.</i>

32:43.211 --> 32:46.130
<i>The Darkening</i>
<i>corrupts everything it touches.</i>

32:46.214 --> 32:49.509
<i>-All Thra is at risk.</i>

32:50.885 --> 32:52.178
All Thra?

32:52.845 --> 32:55.515
<i>Behold...</i>

34:01.622 --> 34:03.708
This happens every time.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.128
You say, "Let's have an adventure, Gurjin.
It'll be great fun, Gurjin."

34:07.211 --> 34:09.464
But it never is. I should be at my post,

34:09.964 --> 34:13.051
not wandering the halls,
looking for phantom Spitters.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.886
I know what I saw.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.763
Perhaps we should turn back.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.848
We can try again tomorrow.

34:19.515 --> 34:21.184
Just a bit further, please.

34:21.267 --> 34:23.269
- A bit further.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.439
-Come on, Gurjin!
-Don't think so, lovebirds. I'm done.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.692
You two have a great time.
I'll entertain myself...

34:30.318 --> 34:31.486
right here.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.947
Let's go.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.705
-Hm?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.544
-All these corridors look the same.
-Mm.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.381
I think we're going in circles.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.426
We should split up.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.186
Where's the fun in that?

35:10.983 --> 35:13.111
Well, if it's fun you're looking for...

35:21.119 --> 35:22.161
How's that?

35:25.248 --> 35:26.666
Good.

35:27.750 --> 35:31.003
<i>♪ A loyal Gelfling serves his lords ♪</i>

35:31.087 --> 35:34.841
<i>♪ And always reaps his just rewards ♪</i>

35:52.733 --> 35:56.195
Spitter!

35:56.487 --> 35:57.321
Rian!

35:58.906 --> 36:00.116
Don't let it escape!

36:01.993 --> 36:03.953
Quickly!

36:07.665 --> 36:08.541
Through there!

36:14.922 --> 36:17.508
-It's escaping. Come on!

36:24.640 --> 36:25.683
What's down there?

36:27.101 --> 36:27.977
Let's see.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.110
Ah! The catacombs.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.405
Gelfling are forbidden
in the catacombs. Skeksis say--

36:41.073 --> 36:42.116
Mira, wait!

36:42.909 --> 36:44.493
We don't have wings.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.379
-There's no sign of the Spitter!
- It could be anywhere!

36:55.463 --> 36:56.547
Wait for us!

37:03.596 --> 37:04.472
Hm?

37:06.599 --> 37:08.017
I'm going down after her!

37:17.568 --> 37:19.237
Is that a good idea?

37:20.029 --> 37:22.990
All right, new plan.
You go, and I'll wait here.

37:24.951 --> 37:25.785
Hm...

37:39.548 --> 37:42.843
I thought I heard something
creeping about.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.638
Naughty, naughty!

38:02.697 --> 38:03.656
Mira?

38:06.158 --> 38:07.159
MIra!

38:23.301 --> 38:25.011
Who is next to give?

38:27.638 --> 38:29.098
Hm...

38:31.100 --> 38:33.436
Your tithe is well received.

38:33.519 --> 38:37.523
Thank you, All-Maudra.
And thanks be to the Lords of the Crystal.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.526
Next!

38:54.373 --> 38:56.917
- Ooh...

39:03.299 --> 39:06.218
Your tithe is wanting.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.637
- Yes, Your Grace.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.848
We beg the lords' forgiveness.

39:10.973 --> 39:14.769
Our land has suffered a strange blight.
Nothing grows.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.481
Hmm.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.733
Lovely.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.902
What is, my lord?

39:23.235 --> 39:24.528
That piece...

39:24.695 --> 39:27.281
-Pretty!
-...about your neck.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.325
My lord is too kind.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.410
It was my mother's.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.663
Her final wisdom
has been dream-etched into the stone.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.500
Now, this...

39:37.833 --> 39:40.461
this would make an honorable tithe!

39:40.544 --> 39:42.004
-Oh!

39:43.547 --> 39:46.258
There's plenty of food in our stores.
We could pay the tithe.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.719
His tithe is his to pay.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.764
But... farmers tithe crops.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.641
He has no crops.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.227
Please, anything but the pendant.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.772
-Perhaps next harvest--

39:59.855 --> 40:00.815
Why?

40:01.148 --> 40:03.442
Why do Gelfling hurt us so?

40:03.943 --> 40:08.656
Skeksis give so much
and ask so, so little!

40:09.448 --> 40:11.325
It breaks our hearts.

40:12.701 --> 40:13.744
Sad!

40:15.413 --> 40:16.664
So sad!

40:17.373 --> 40:20.000
-Boo!
-He has to pay!

40:21.877 --> 40:23.462
He should've brought more!

40:23.546 --> 40:24.922
You should be ashamed!

40:26.549 --> 40:28.968
- We all have to pay!
- The lords are benevolent!

40:29.051 --> 40:31.262
-Kind!
- He has to pay!

40:31.345 --> 40:34.807
They never take that which is not given.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.359
I'm sorry.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.037
-This is wrong!
-This is the law.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.165
It's the way of things.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.837
The tithe...

41:06.422 --> 41:08.048
is accepted!

41:15.014 --> 41:16.640
Thank you, my lords.

41:17.975 --> 41:18.809
Thank you.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.022
Next!

41:47.630 --> 41:49.590
You look troubled, child.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.425
I've been reading about the tithing.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.677
Hm? Hm...

41:54.595 --> 41:57.181
The Skeksis laws. Very good.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.975
-None of it makes sense.
-What?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.936
If the Skeksis are all-powerful,

42:02.019 --> 42:03.479
and they have everything,

42:03.562 --> 42:06.982
then why do they require tithes
from even the poorest Gelfling?

42:07.066 --> 42:10.194
Because all Gelfling benefit
from Skeksis rule.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.905
So all Gelfling must contribute.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.949
Or perhaps...

42:15.407 --> 42:17.952
they want us fighting each other
for the leftovers.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.455
Yes, well,
I think that's enough reading for today.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.041
I was-- I was still looking at that. I...

42:24.291 --> 42:26.293
Come back! I... I'm not done!

42:26.377 --> 42:27.628
Don't go down this path!

42:27.711 --> 42:29.922
-I'll go where I please.
-Nothing good will come of this.

42:30.005 --> 42:33.050
I think the Skeksis are hiding something,
and I want to know what!

42:33.133 --> 42:36.220
- I demand you stop!
-I demand the truth!

42:44.853 --> 42:46.480
Princess, what have you done?

42:47.648 --> 42:48.732
What's happening?

42:50.401 --> 42:52.486
No! No, not my books!

42:52.903 --> 42:54.446
-My manuscripts!

42:56.490 --> 42:57.324
Wait!

42:58.075 --> 42:59.285
Come back!

43:44.330 --> 43:45.205
Ow!

44:14.735 --> 44:15.736
Mother?

44:16.570 --> 44:17.488
Mother!

44:17.905 --> 44:21.200
-Mother, I had a vision!
-You read too many stories.

44:21.283 --> 44:23.869
No, this was real! I heard a sound like...

44:24.161 --> 44:25.954
like singing, but louder.

44:26.038 --> 44:30.459
And there was a burning symbol
in the air, and I... I can show you!

44:30.542 --> 44:33.671
-If we dreamfast, I--
-Very well, but quickly.

44:34.129 --> 44:36.965
The tithing did not go smoothly,
and I'm tired.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.682
What's wrong?

44:45.265 --> 44:47.601
That pendant belongs to the farmer's wife.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.479
No.
They gave it to the Skeksis,

44:50.562 --> 44:52.398
who in turn gave it to me.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.359
-Well, then you can give it back.
- Our position.

44:55.984 --> 44:57.194
This palace.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.988
-The food on our table.
-I know.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.533
-Even the books in your precious library!
-Mother, I know.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.077
All thanks to the Skeksis' generosity.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.997
-Would you give them all back as well?
-Yes.

45:09.623 --> 45:12.251
That's a childling's answer!

45:12.960 --> 45:16.380
It's easier to have nothing
when no one depends on you for anything.

45:17.756 --> 45:19.133
-I only meant that--

45:19.216 --> 45:22.469
It's time you started to act
like a princess.

45:22.928 --> 45:25.097
-I want you in court in the morning.

45:25.431 --> 45:26.390
On time.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.809
And don't get lost on the way again.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.602
I will.

45:31.603 --> 45:33.689
I mean... I won't.

45:34.064 --> 45:37.776
The Skeksis can't save you
every time you're in trouble.

45:59.089 --> 45:59.965
No.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.384
We have to save them!

46:03.135 --> 46:05.971
-Deet, you're home. All's well.

46:06.054 --> 46:06.972
Father.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.433
-Where--
-We're all here, Deet.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.354
So...

46:14.605 --> 46:17.191
she finally wakes. Ha!

46:17.274 --> 46:18.525
Maudra Argot?

46:18.609 --> 46:21.570
Ah! Let's see how bad it is.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.032
Not that I see much since my eyes went.

46:29.077 --> 46:33.040
Oh, a few bruises, bites.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.210
A torn wing.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.796
Nothing that can't be healed.

46:39.087 --> 46:41.590
You're perfectly safe now, Deet.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.634
No, none of us are safe.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.594
The Darkening is spreading
throughout Thra.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.554
What? What Darkening?

46:48.472 --> 46:50.808
It's like... a sickness.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.559
Oh, I'd know if Thra was sick.

46:52.976 --> 46:54.686
Who told you this, Deet?

46:55.604 --> 46:56.814
The Sanctuary Tree.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.525
The Sanctuary Tree is a tree.

46:59.608 --> 47:01.235
-Trees can't talk.
-Mm.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.279
Except when they can.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.115
Tell me.

47:07.908 --> 47:11.912
What did the Sanctuary Tree
say to you, Deethra?

47:14.414 --> 47:17.167
It told me I had to stop the Darkening.

47:18.168 --> 47:21.338
It showed me creatures driven mad,

47:21.630 --> 47:23.173
a dying tree,

47:23.715 --> 47:25.926
and a one-eyed crone with horns.

47:26.552 --> 47:27.678
Not Gelfling.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.264
Old and sad.

47:31.431 --> 47:33.725
Mother Aughra.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.186
What does it mean?

47:37.437 --> 47:40.357
-It means you must leave.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.651
-Absolutely not.
-Where would she go?

47:42.818 --> 47:45.571
She must journey to the All-Maudra.

47:45.737 --> 47:47.739
Warn her of this threat.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.993
Deet. Why Deet go?

47:55.914 --> 47:58.166
Because the Sanctuary Tree chose me.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.961
It did. It chose well.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.298
No arguing with trees!

48:06.466 --> 48:09.469
Now...

48:10.345 --> 48:11.972
Ah!

48:12.222 --> 48:16.018
Take this.
Rub it on your wing twice a day.

48:16.351 --> 48:17.477
Smells bad,

48:17.561 --> 48:19.813
heals good!

48:21.064 --> 48:22.149
Oh!

48:22.232 --> 48:26.403
There, for your eyes.
They'll be sensitive at first.

48:28.071 --> 48:32.409
Follow the brightest star
in the sky north, to Ha'rar.

48:32.784 --> 48:34.578
Oh, what's a star?

48:34.786 --> 48:38.165
Oh, you'll see soon enough, Deet.

48:39.499 --> 48:43.670
A whole new world waits for you.

49:06.610 --> 49:07.986
Huh? Mira?

49:09.237 --> 49:10.530
Mira?

49:26.421 --> 49:30.008
-Ow! Contemptible contraption!

49:30.258 --> 49:33.011
SkekTek! It smells terrible in here.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.890
-I've never liked this infernal place.
-Ah!

49:36.974 --> 49:40.769
Patience.
I think you will be most impressed.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.315
This had better work.

49:45.399 --> 49:48.151
Of course, My Emperor, you will see.

49:48.235 --> 49:50.404
I have solved all our problems.

49:50.487 --> 49:54.032
- Will snacks be served?

49:54.116 --> 49:56.243
- No.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.788
Don't you ever think of anything
but your next meal?

49:59.913 --> 50:01.748
I eat when I'm stressed.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.792
You must often
be stressed, yes?

50:03.875 --> 50:06.461
- All the time!

50:06.586 --> 50:07.754
Quiet!

50:07.838 --> 50:10.424
-Begin, skekTek.
- Yes, Emperor.

50:14.803 --> 50:18.348
The Emperor will skin the Scientist alive
if this fails.

50:18.432 --> 50:21.018
I have just the knife
for such an occasion.

50:21.101 --> 50:24.229
- Lords, as you well know,

50:24.312 --> 50:28.316
our mighty Emperor tasked
this humble Skeksis

50:28.483 --> 50:30.736
-with an impossible--
-Get on with it!

50:31.236 --> 50:32.529
Of course.

50:32.612 --> 50:37.034
Allow me, if you will,
to introduce our honored guest.

50:37.451 --> 50:40.620
Come out! Don't be shy!

50:43.790 --> 50:45.250
Huh?

50:45.876 --> 50:48.712
What is that? What is that?

50:50.672 --> 50:53.967
- Mira!
-A Gelfling? Here?

50:54.134 --> 50:55.135
Sacrilege!

50:55.635 --> 50:58.472
-Have you no sense of propriety?
-Hush!

50:59.097 --> 51:00.891
Continue, skekTek.

51:01.433 --> 51:06.146
Be welcome, Gelfling.
I require your assistance.

51:06.980 --> 51:10.192
Look. Do you know what this is?

51:18.742 --> 51:20.368
It's the Crystal of Truth.

51:20.452 --> 51:23.455
Yes. Isn't it lovely?

51:34.049 --> 51:36.802
No! What are you doing to it?

51:36.885 --> 51:39.012
Just a little experiment.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.056
Such an honor for you.

51:41.139 --> 51:45.393
No Gelfling has laid eyes upon the Crystal
in a thousand trine.

51:45.477 --> 51:47.437
Look deep into it.

51:50.440 --> 51:54.027
I feel... It's pulling.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.570
- Don't, Mira!
- Ah|!

51:55.654 --> 51:56.905
Don't fight.

51:57.364 --> 52:01.910
Give. Give the Crystal your fear,

52:01.993 --> 52:05.288
your love, your secrets.

52:06.081 --> 52:08.750
-Please, my lords, help me.

52:08.834 --> 52:11.378
- Give the Crystal everything.
- I...

52:11.795 --> 52:14.506
Give it your very essence!

52:18.802 --> 52:19.719
No!

52:20.262 --> 52:21.930
-Mira!

52:25.100 --> 52:28.061
-No! What have you--
-What have you done?

52:28.145 --> 52:31.439
No, wait! Behold!

52:48.957 --> 52:51.251
Here is the answer we seek!

52:51.334 --> 52:54.838
Here is life everlasting!

52:58.008 --> 52:59.009
Rian...

53:09.895 --> 53:10.770
Mira!

53:14.900 --> 53:16.109
Mira!

53:21.865 --> 53:23.200
My machine!

53:26.036 --> 53:26.870
No!

53:35.295 --> 53:36.755
-Where did she go?
-What...

53:36.838 --> 53:38.006
-Where did she--
-Where?

53:38.089 --> 53:40.050
-Explain yourself, Scientist.

53:40.258 --> 53:42.969
I have drained the Gelfling's essence.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.597
-This is the solution to our problem.
-What?

53:45.680 --> 53:47.641
A new source of life.

53:48.099 --> 53:51.311
Here, My Emperor, for you. Drink.

53:51.394 --> 53:53.855
You must drink. Ah!

54:08.119 --> 54:09.955
Ah! Agh!

54:11.081 --> 54:13.250
How do you feel, sire?

54:15.043 --> 54:17.337
I feel...

54:18.004 --> 54:19.172
I feel...

54:19.256 --> 54:22.259
-...strong!

54:22.717 --> 54:23.677
Ah!

54:24.219 --> 54:26.263
-My turn! My turn!
-I want some!

54:33.186 --> 54:35.355
-Move aside!

54:35.605 --> 54:37.190
-You're in my way!
-Don't push.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.609
Don't push me! I want a taste!

54:41.486 --> 54:45.115
Don't drink it all, imbeciles.
It must be saved.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.242
-Stop it!
-Enough!

54:47.701 --> 54:49.327
-It's mine!
-Bring it back.

54:50.245 --> 54:52.872
-I want more!

54:56.418 --> 54:57.752
-Fools!
- What a gorgeous feeling!

54:57.836 --> 55:00.422
- What did I tell you?

55:14.185 --> 55:16.354
Tonight, we celebrate!

55:16.479 --> 55:20.358
Let us feast! Music! Revelry!

55:20.483 --> 55:24.029
For this day, the Skeksis conquered death!

55:44.382 --> 55:45.717
Arr!

55:47.552 --> 55:48.511
Mira...

55:51.556 --> 55:54.184
-Huh?

55:56.227 --> 55:58.438
-Gelfling!

55:59.939 --> 56:01.900
-Gelfling has seen!
-Seize it!

56:01.983 --> 56:04.527
-Dirty lookie-loo!
-You'll die for this!

56:06.029 --> 56:08.114
It saw! It knows!

56:08.198 --> 56:09.741
I know that Gelfling!

56:10.075 --> 56:12.452
-It's the captain's son, Rian!

56:12.535 --> 56:15.121
-Oh, no!
-It must not escape the castle.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.123
-Yes.
-As you command!

56:17.207 --> 56:20.001
He will not escape us!
No, no, go, go, go!

56:20.085 --> 56:23.088
Seal the exits.
The Gelfling could not have gone far.

56:23.171 --> 56:25.131
Has the Gelfling learned
what we have done?

56:25.215 --> 56:27.884
The Emperor must remember his own words.

56:28.968 --> 56:31.513
We are Lords of the Crystal, yes?

56:31.596 --> 56:35.225
Even if Rian talk, none will believe.

56:38.269 --> 56:40.438
<i>They will shun him.</i>

56:40.897 --> 56:43.191
<i>-Cast him out.</i>

56:43.942 --> 56:45.819
<i>How can they not? </i>

56:45.902 --> 56:50.657
<i>To believe him</i>
<i>is not to believe themselves.</i>

56:53.284 --> 56:57.163
<i>Skeksis reign a thousand trine</i>

56:57.247 --> 57:00.917
<i>and will reign a thousand thousand more,</i>

57:01.292 --> 57:05.380
<i>until last star in sky goes dark.</i>

57:10.260 --> 57:12.846
<i>Gelfling will submit, </i>

57:13.012 --> 57:14.597
<i>head bowed, </i>

57:14.681 --> 57:18.601
<i>back bent as have always done.</i>

57:20.311 --> 57:23.731
<i>-Gelfling want to be ruled.</i>

57:25.567 --> 57:28.319
<i>Gelfling need to be ruled.</i>

57:28.403 --> 57:29.529
Bye!

57:30.697 --> 57:34.033
-Deet!
- Because Gelfling are weak!

57:36.244 --> 57:38.621
<i>Gelfling are small.</i>

57:44.544 --> 57:49.090
<i>And Skeksis are forever!</i>

58:01.644 --> 58:04.230
<i>We took the Crystal.</i>

58:05.064 --> 58:08.151
<i>Thra belongs to us now.</i>

58:09.903 --> 58:11.362
<i>And is nothing...</i>

58:11.863 --> 58:14.824
<i>nothing Gelfling can do!</i>
