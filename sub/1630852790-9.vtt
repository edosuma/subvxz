00:33.150 --> 00:35.310
Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up!

00:37.420 --> 00:41.020
He's so excited. Okay, be right there.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.360
Like I said, our hospital can't take any more patients in.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.190
This man was sent here because of the coldness in his right leg.

00:47.190 --> 00:47.730
No, we can't take him.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.460
We're afraid that he's got peripheral vascular disease.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.430
[Episode 9]

00:56.800 --> 00:59.770
But why did you have to try that hard?

01:00.340 --> 01:02.410
You could've just walked away and ignored it

01:03.010 --> 01:04.040
in a situation like that.

01:05.910 --> 01:07.750
Because I didn't want to become a klutz like you.

01:14.590 --> 01:16.990
I would be mad at myself

01:18.320 --> 01:22.360
if I couldn't do anything but watch

01:23.360 --> 01:25.800
a patient dying in front of me.

01:27.130 --> 01:35.610
I didn't want to experience that horrible moment again.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.479
Go Seung Tak.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.210
What are you doing here?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.979
He's got arterial blockage in the right leg, right?

01:45.520 --> 01:47.220
Take him to the treatment room. I'll treat him.

01:47.220 --> 01:47.890
What?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.190
What are you doing?

01:49.550 --> 01:50.860
You said no operating room was available.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.520
So I'll take a look at him at the treatment room. Take him over there.

01:53.229 --> 01:55.460
He doesn't even have an ID.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.289
So what?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.400
Don't you see that his leg is turning pale?

01:58.400 --> 01:59.130
We can't afford any further delay,

01:59.130 --> 02:01.670
or he can't be saved anymore if his leg turns blue.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.370
Take him over there.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.600
Hey, what are you doing?

02:05.100 --> 02:06.240
Why are you taking him in?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.610
As doctors, we can't just…

02:11.840 --> 02:14.680
We can't just send patients away.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.150
We… Well…

02:18.720 --> 02:19.850
Especially the doctors in my hospital.

02:22.290 --> 02:22.920
Then…

02:22.920 --> 02:24.620
Take him in. Come on.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.630
Hey. Hey!

02:31.100 --> 02:34.070
They can't do anything to me

02:34.070 --> 02:36.000
because of my special identity.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.840
But a poor intern suddenly turned

02:39.570 --> 02:41.410
into a talented super intern

02:41.840 --> 02:43.740
and caught everybody's attention.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.050
The world wouldn't have just let you off easily, right?

02:49.079 --> 02:49.980
No.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.920
You are right about that.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.090
Hey, brat!

02:56.090 --> 02:57.760
How dare you ignore our order?

02:57.760 --> 03:00.330
You think you are the only talented one?

03:00.330 --> 03:02.890
You think you are a genius, don't you?

03:02.890 --> 03:03.960
What a genius!

03:03.960 --> 03:06.130
You have no respect for us.

03:06.130 --> 03:08.070
You should've sent the patient back as we asked!

03:08.070 --> 03:10.000
Who do you think you are to operate on a patient?

03:10.300 --> 03:12.370
Life was already tough enough.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.740
But that made it harder.

03:16.910 --> 03:20.610
I just wanted to save patients' lives.

03:21.050 --> 03:24.680
I was just a nobody, so I couldn't argue.

03:25.220 --> 03:28.620
Therefore, I did what I could.

03:29.420 --> 03:32.760
No matter what, I needed to survive.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.130
What about you?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.060
Why did you do it?

03:36.700 --> 03:40.000
You were the only one whom I could possess.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.700
I didn't have a choice.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
But you could've said no.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.170
Why didn't you?

03:45.170 --> 03:47.010
Weren't you afraid I'd bring you bad luck?

03:47.010 --> 03:48.670
I'm still afraid of that.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.670
Darn it.

03:50.579 --> 03:51.440
Because

03:52.579 --> 03:54.050
I saw it with my own eyes

03:58.780 --> 04:00.290
and I could imagine

04:00.790 --> 04:05.460
how you grew from an intern to a highly-skilled specialist.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.460
How do I put this?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.700
You were like an extremely competitive warrior.

04:18.839 --> 04:19.640
Let's begin.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.370
Be focused.

04:20.370 --> 04:21.110
Scalpel.

04:27.710 --> 04:28.450
Suction.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.580
Forceps.

04:38.420 --> 04:39.260
Retractor.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.500
That's why you want to be a doctor,

04:47.030 --> 04:48.430
no matter you are alive or dead,

04:48.930 --> 04:49.930
you always do.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
In that case,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.740
you should keep fighting like you used to.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.010
Press.

05:08.490 --> 05:09.690
Needle holder.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.350
Well done.

05:33.980 --> 05:35.409
Of course.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.220
My golden hands are…

05:40.690 --> 05:41.320
Golden…

05:44.220 --> 05:45.290
So,

05:45.590 --> 05:49.230
this operation record which should've been written by Go Seung Tak was actually written by Cha Yeong Min?

05:49.230 --> 05:51.360
And Go Seung Tak didn't even know it was done?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.200
And it was erased later when you checked it,

05:53.470 --> 05:56.900
yet you don't know it was erased by Go Seung Tak or Cha Yeong Min?

05:59.140 --> 06:00.610
What the heck are you talking about?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.010
I know it sounds ridiculous,

06:02.610 --> 06:03.340
but…

06:03.340 --> 06:04.540
Are you drunk?

06:05.540 --> 06:07.080
I just had a drink.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.810
I've been keeping it to myself.

06:08.810 --> 06:13.080
It's not the only strange thing about Go Seung Tak.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.390
But if we presume it's true,

06:15.890 --> 06:17.220
then it'd all add up.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.320
Presume what? What?

06:21.690 --> 06:25.200
That Cha Yeong Min became a ghost and possessed Go Seung Tak's body?

06:26.460 --> 06:28.670
How could you say such thing when you are a doctor?

06:36.070 --> 06:37.310
Why are you calling me this late?

06:39.110 --> 06:39.980
Who's there?

06:42.380 --> 06:43.820
Alright, I see.

06:53.890 --> 06:55.360
You'd better do a checkup.

06:55.730 --> 06:57.300
Not in our hospital though. Go to another one.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.470
Stop drinking and take some medicine.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.500
I've got enough problems. How could you…

07:04.340 --> 07:05.940
Then what about Go Seung Tak's surgical skills?

07:11.180 --> 07:12.480
How do you explain that?

07:17.180 --> 07:18.650
O Su Jeong, how dare you?

07:18.650 --> 07:21.190
Well, I'm still learning.

07:21.190 --> 07:26.860
Oh, you are still learning so you can call whoever you want without asking for permission?

07:26.860 --> 07:28.060
What's wrong with you?

07:28.060 --> 07:30.060
You think the emergency room is a call center

07:30.060 --> 07:31.100
where you can let everybody in

07:31.100 --> 07:32.700
and call anybody you want?

07:32.700 --> 07:33.500
But

07:33.500 --> 07:34.870
neither is it a grocery store

07:34.870 --> 07:36.470
where you can send a patient back like returning goods.

07:36.470 --> 07:37.640
R-returning…

07:38.140 --> 07:40.510
How could you say such rude words?

07:40.510 --> 07:43.010
My apologies. I'll go back to work now.

07:43.940 --> 07:44.510
Gosh,

07:46.980 --> 07:49.010
young people nowadays are so…

07:49.010 --> 07:52.250
They should test your manners during the medical exams.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.390
Can't believe it. How did such a rude person become a doctor?

07:57.620 --> 07:58.460
What are you doing?

07:58.460 --> 07:59.320
Disinfecting.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.430
Something's been lingering around here.

08:01.430 --> 08:02.390
And it smells.

08:02.630 --> 08:04.430
Smells like either cow, or dog, or chicken, or horse.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.330
Oh, it's right here. Smell it.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.270
No. It's here.

08:09.270 --> 08:10.100
Bad manners!

08:10.100 --> 08:11.470
You've got to test it.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.600

08:12.600 --> 08:16.470
Those who don't look like doctors can all wear it anyway.

By the way, our pretty doctor

08:41.570 --> 08:42.929
looks quite happy today.

08:42.929 --> 08:44.670
Any good news?

08:44.670 --> 08:45.700
Is it that obvious?

08:45.700 --> 08:46.700
Yep.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.170
I do have good news.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.850
Is it because

08:53.850 --> 08:55.550
that Dr. Go

08:55.550 --> 08:56.920
stood up for the patient?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.720
You saw that? He did very well, didn't he?

08:59.750 --> 09:02.590
It's not something I can understand though.

09:02.590 --> 09:04.560
But why do you feel happy

09:04.560 --> 09:06.760
that Dr. Go did a good job?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.590
Doesn't he still owe you a lot?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.360
About that…

09:11.200 --> 09:14.000
He has begun to pay it back little by little.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.270
Really? Congratulations!

09:17.270 --> 09:18.640
I've told you that.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.970
He's not a bad person.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.380
But why do you know him so well?

09:29.150 --> 09:30.210
Well…

09:30.210 --> 09:33.020
I'm old so I know what people are like.

09:33.690 --> 09:36.090
That is called discernment.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.990

Please be careful next time.

10:20.570 --> 10:21.600

10:24.100 --> 10:26.440

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
So I stopped by.

11:04.780 --> 11:06.840
how could you smell so drunk?

11:08.350 --> 11:10.750
I had a meal with others today.

Sorry, grandpa.

You should contact us in advance.

11:44.150 --> 11:44.980
What?

11:44.980 --> 11:47.920
I heard that Thoracic Surgery Department has had a hard time lately.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.620
Tell me, is there any problem?

11:54.660 --> 11:58.100
Since you mentioned it, I would report some.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.800

No. President, I'm paying attention to Professor Cha's situation.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.790
It's okay to pay attention to that.

12:21.790 --> 12:25.260
But you should find a new doctor for the patients.

He is just like you.

1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:08.450
Attending doctor!

1:05:08.450 --> 1:05:09.250
Did you come alone?

1:05:09.250 --> 1:05:10.290
Where is Professor Cha Yeong Min?

1:05:10.290 --> 1:05:11.120
He is only a kid.

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:12.190
Let me operate on him.

1:05:12.190 --> 1:05:13.290
What would happen

1:05:13.290 --> 1:05:14.560
if Professor Cha died?
