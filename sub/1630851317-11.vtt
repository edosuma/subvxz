Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.656 --> 00:06.484
Sorry, it should work.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.834
- I put money on it yesterday.
- Don't worry about it.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
I have cash.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.186
Relax, it's on me.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.405
I saw you help out that
rich old lady and her daughter.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.018
You do what you can.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.584
You can always tell
the people

00:19.628 --> 00:21.412
who've never ridden
a bus before.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.459
They act like they're going on
a poor person safari.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.375
Their entitlement's disgusting.

00:27.418 --> 00:28.767
Olivia.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.943
Douglas.

00:30.987 --> 00:33.859
Actually, Doug.
Down-to-Earth Doug.

00:33.903 --> 00:38.560
That's what my buddies
in the warehouse call me.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.127
You know, it's important
to have the support

00:40.170 --> 00:42.477
of the community when you
first move to this country.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.392
Yes. I am so thankful for it.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.481
Then you should be
very careful.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.091
Regarding?

00:48.135 --> 00:50.963
I know you are...

00:51.007 --> 00:52.878
gay.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.358
Thanks to you,

00:54.402 --> 00:57.579
I will soon have more
grandchildren than my sister.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.972
- How many does she have?
- Only seven.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.238
Chidi Connor Chukwuemeka.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.717
It has a nice ring.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.371
What do you think, Morenike?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.201
I cannot do this.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.552
I threatened you.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.033
- What?
- This is your cover story.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.774
I threatened you,
and this is why

01:18.817 --> 01:20.297
you left our arrangement.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.299
There were no other
personal reasons.

01:22.343 --> 01:27.217
No need to mention
your... lesbianity.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.479
Although it is your life,

01:28.523 --> 01:29.828
and if you feel like
you must...

01:29.872 --> 01:30.916
I am not ready for that.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.875
Oh, thank God.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.922
God is good.

01:36.966 --> 01:39.011
Well, you are in
a wonderful mood.

01:39.055 --> 01:42.972
I introduced Ebun the Terrible
to Ogechi, the Equally Terrible.

01:45.496 --> 01:46.802
Their combined judgment
and negativity

01:46.845 --> 01:48.499
will consume them both.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.636
Or they will join forces
and destroy us all.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.469
You doing all right
there, Chuey?

02:01.512 --> 02:02.905
Hello, Bob.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.821
I was just thinking about
what could have been.

02:05.864 --> 02:08.302
Yeah, I'm sorry
about all that.

02:08.345 --> 02:11.174
- You heard about Morenike?
- I did.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.134
She just did not seem like
that kind of girl.

02:14.177 --> 02:17.441
Well, you really can't tell
that kind of thing by looking.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.270
Although my mom thinks she can.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.360
It just hurts to be rejected
over something I cannot control.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.232
I think that's better.
It's not you.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.450
If she's gay, she's gay.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.626
She's gay?!

02:28.670 --> 02:32.108
What's that, now?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.632
I was told she did not like
the size of my ears.
Yeah.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.460
I think we're both saying
- the same thing.
- You said she was gay.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.853
No, I didn't.
You did.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.681
Well, don't believe
everything you hear,

02:39.724 --> 02:40.899
especially with those
tiny ears.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.689
Real quick, we gotta talk.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.734
- What is it?
- It's not a big deal.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.214
It might be a big deal.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.869
It's a big deal.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.176
Abishola, I love your church.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.265
I'm glad you enjoyed it,
Mummy.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.831
That Ogechi is wonderful.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.529
So beautiful and funny.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.749
She reminds me of me.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.230
You know that thing
you were privy to,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.971
that then I was privy to,

03:09.014 --> 03:11.365
but no one else
was privy to?

03:11.408 --> 03:14.803
Well, I may have made
Chukwuemeka... privy.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.414
What?

03:17.458 --> 03:19.242
And I love the congregation.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.288
Ogechi says I should
consider moving.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.985
What?!

03:23.028 --> 03:25.379
I would get to enjoy
the Nigerian community here

03:25.422 --> 03:27.163
and be closer to you,
Abishola.

03:27.207 --> 03:31.254
I could be by your side
at every moment.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.649
But-but wouldn't Dele need your
guidance and wisdom in Nigeria?

03:34.692 --> 03:37.173
It's fine.
We could FaceTime.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.700
Of course you can stay
as long as you want, Mummy.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.225
Unless Bob can think of a reason
why you could not.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.749
Maybe I should go back
to Nigeria with Dele.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.316
What are you talking about?

03:49.359 --> 03:51.361
Just until you stop
being mad at me.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.233
Why would I be mad at you?

03:53.276 --> 03:55.235
Is that Kemi?
Yes.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.106
Oh, she'll tell you.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.935
Hello?

04:26.570 --> 04:28.659
Hey.
Hey.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.619
Would it be too forward to offer
the bus driver a snack?

04:31.662 --> 04:33.229
Oh, it's kind of against
company policy.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.839
God, it's...

04:37.146 --> 04:40.367
- Go ahead and take that.
- You devil.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
I've been called worse.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.591
So, now that I've
effectively bribed you,

04:47.635 --> 04:49.158
maybe it's time we go
on a real date.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.552
You mean off the bus?

04:51.595 --> 04:54.076
I do.
I'd like that.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.947
- So would I.
- Then we should.

04:55.991 --> 04:59.299
- Why don't we?
- I'm pretty sure we are.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.952
Then it's a date.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.998
I can't wait. Douchebag.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.652
Excuse me?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.784
This guy in the Porsche
in front of me.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.396
Hang up with your accountant.
The light's green!

05:11.702 --> 05:13.138
Some people are just
so entitled.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.445
Yeah. Plus, that's
a base-model Porsche.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.709
He couldn't even spring
- for the Touring Package.
- Huh?

05:18.753 --> 05:20.494
Nothing. Move it, loser!

05:20.537 --> 05:24.324
Never touch a lady's horn.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
Got it.
We're not there yet.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.899
Okay, so I spoke to
Chukwuemeka.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.554
He has promised he will not
tell anybody about Morenike.

05:37.598 --> 05:40.078
Which means his mother will know
in about two hours.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.863
And once he's told Ogechi,

05:41.906 --> 05:42.994
he's told the whole
of Nigeria.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.126
- Really?
- Yes.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.910
Same day delivery.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.870
She's the Amazon Prime
- of gossip.
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.913 --> 05:52.656
It's hard to believe Ogechi
got a bigger mouth than Kemi.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.702
She does not.

05:55.964 --> 05:59.837
It is true. I have been known
to spread a tasty morsel or two.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.143
Morsel or two?!

06:01.186 --> 06:03.014
You come running to me
every time one of your

06:03.058 --> 06:04.625
kitchen boys sleeps
with another nurse.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.366
Would you rather I not tell you?

06:06.409 --> 06:08.933
I didn't say that.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.240
Okay, then.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.417
Because Dominic is sleeping with
a certain busty brunette

06:14.461 --> 06:15.679
in Pediatrics.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.768
- Vanessa?
- Bustier.

06:17.812 --> 06:18.943
Joann?!

06:18.987 --> 06:21.946
You see, for me,
it's not about the gossip.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.209
It's about the joy it puts
on people's faces.

06:25.602 --> 06:26.690
I hate to think about
what would happen

06:26.734 --> 06:28.605
if Morenike's family
does find out.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.954
You think they'll disown her?

06:29.998 --> 06:32.217
Or worse, call her
back to Nigeria

06:32.261 --> 06:34.916
and force her to marry
a man of their choosing.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.265
At least she'll have a family.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.354
Yes, a family, but no freedom.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.051
Here she can be herself,

06:40.095 --> 06:42.967
frolicking with the other
lesbians at the farmers market.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.189
What can you do?
- You can't stop the rumor mill.
- No.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.539
But if you cannot stop
the message,

06:49.583 --> 06:51.715
you can attack the messenger.

06:51.759 --> 06:52.847
What do you mean?

06:52.890 --> 06:55.502
I could spread a rumor
about Ogechi.

06:55.545 --> 06:58.766
Something much juicier than
Morenike's lesbianity.

06:58.809 --> 07:02.117
What's juicier than lesbianity?

07:02.160 --> 07:05.512
I'm just spitballing here,
but maybe something about

07:05.555 --> 07:08.515
Ogechi's mental state;
perhaps dementia.

07:08.558 --> 07:12.301
Or syphilis.
Or dementia caused by syphilis.

07:12.344 --> 07:15.086
Ooh, look at that mouth go.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.653
It's nice to see you
use it for good.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.701
I do what I can.

07:23.051 --> 07:26.620
Hey, do either of you guys know
any cheap date spots?

07:26.663 --> 07:29.231
My wife and I go to the library.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.929
We each pick out a book
we think the other would like.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.757
That sounds lovely.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.367
You do not know romance
until you have had your wife

07:35.411 --> 07:37.500
read Tom Clancy aloud.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.154
Does that get you laid?

07:39.197 --> 07:41.112
No.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.114
Perhaps you can take
a walk by the lake.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.856
I know it smells like
dirty diapers and dead fish,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.945
but sometimes you can see
a sailboat.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.948
So what I'm getting from both
of you is that being poor sucks.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.255
- Yes, it does.
- It is not the greatest.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.563
What's going on?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.782
My working-class alter ego
has a date.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.655
Nice! What's that mean?

08:01.698 --> 08:04.701
Met this bus driver.
She's super cool.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.703
But I kind of told her
I was poor,

08:06.747 --> 08:08.139
which means I can't
buy her things

08:08.183 --> 08:09.924
to get her to like me.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.926
You do not have to
buy women things

08:11.969 --> 08:13.449
to get them to like you.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.713
Kofo, bud, that's the
dumbest thing I've ever heard.

08:16.757 --> 08:20.108
Douglas, just be yourself.
It has worked so far.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.328
No, it hasn't.
She's never met the real Doug.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.592
She only knows Bus Doug.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.508
Bus Doug is charming
and down to earth.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.119
Can I meet Bus Doug?

08:31.162 --> 08:32.773
You'd like him.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.514
He yells at Porsches
and gives out pudding cups.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.563
We just need to warn Morenike

08:40.607 --> 08:41.564
that her secret
may be getting out.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.914
Mm-hmm.
Because of Bob!

08:43.958 --> 08:45.437
Do we have to mention
the Bob part?

08:45.481 --> 08:47.657
Did you have to mention
the gay part?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.572
Fair.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.967
Be gone, servant of Satan!

08:53.010 --> 08:54.534
That can't be good.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.363
We rebuke the demon
of gayness.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.540
- Exit!
- Be gone!

09:00.583 --> 09:02.324
Don't just stand there.
Join the circle.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.978
Morenike needs your prayers.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.635
I really shouldn't.
I'm a Presbyterian.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.994
Your child has strayed,
O God. Please,

09:20.037 --> 09:23.084
give her the strength
to find her way back to you.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.347
- Bring her back!
- Hallelujah!

09:25.390 --> 09:28.568
Neither adulterers, nor men
who have sex with men

09:28.611 --> 09:30.482
will inherit the kingdom
of God!

09:30.526 --> 09:31.745
- Praise His kingdom!
- Amen!

09:31.788 --> 09:32.876
Um, Pastor,

09:32.920 --> 09:35.923
what about the women?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.446
Excuse me?

09:37.489 --> 09:39.187
Well, you just quoted
First Corinthians,

09:39.230 --> 09:42.277
which I do not believe
contains any mention of...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.105
lady love.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.325
Just as man shall not
lie with man,

09:47.369 --> 09:49.284
woman shall not lie
with woman.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.460
According to you.

09:51.503 --> 09:55.420
But God remains rather
quiet on the subject.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.075
How dare you question
a man of God.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.643
He has dropped everything
to help us guide Sister Morenike

10:00.687 --> 10:02.471
away from the devil's clutches!

10:02.514 --> 10:04.734
Let us pray.

10:04.778 --> 10:08.259
Yes, for all our wretched souls.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.261
What are you talking about?

10:10.305 --> 10:11.654
Haven't we all sinned?

10:11.698 --> 10:15.658
Leviticus says pork
is forbidden.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.530
Have we not all enjoyed
the sins of a Baconator?

10:18.574 --> 10:21.838
Big-time sinner
over here.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.059
I, too, have strayed.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.975
Plus, Romans 1:30 says
that slanderers and gossips

10:28.018 --> 10:29.193
deserve to die.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.630
Pastor...

10:30.673 --> 10:31.935
does that mean
we will have to

10:31.979 --> 10:34.590
put our dear Ogechi down
like a dog?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.201
Do not be ridiculous.
You are the sinner,

10:37.245 --> 10:39.987
fornicating with
my Chukwuemeka out of wedlock.

10:40.030 --> 10:43.730
My biggest sin is
enjoying every second of it.

10:43.773 --> 10:48.386
You allow your son
to be bewitched by that?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.954
- You are one to talk.
- What does that mean?

10:50.998 --> 10:53.565
Your daughter is divorced

10:53.609 --> 10:56.743
and married to a Presbyterian.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.963
Come to think of it,
I may be Lutheran.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966
See, he does not even know
what God he worships.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.708
He may be godless, but I heard
you have syphilis.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.451
Ooh, I heard that rumor, too.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.931
Are you all right?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.280
Do you need to go home

11:12.323 --> 11:13.585
- and take care of your syphilis?
- How dare you!

11:13.629 --> 11:15.065
I am not saying
it is true,

11:15.109 --> 11:17.459
I am telling you what I heard
on the streets of Detroit.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.460
You do not want trouble with me.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.722
You do not want my trouble.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.029
I want your trouble.
I invite your trouble...

11:23.247 --> 11:25.772
Hey.
Hey.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.469
I thought I wasn't seeing you
until later.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.819
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.388
But first, I gotta pay
with my black card.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.172
You have a black card?

11:35.216 --> 11:37.174
Yes, I have a black card,

11:37.218 --> 11:39.611
because, Olivia,

11:39.655 --> 11:42.179
I am a douchebag.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.746
What?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.706
I lied to you.
I'm not down to earth.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
I collect watches.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.622
I sleep on Egyptian
cotton sheets.

11:50.666 --> 11:51.798
I stand because
I like talking to you,

11:51.841 --> 11:53.974
but also 'cause these
bus seats are gross.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.889
And these are $800 jeans.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.412
$800?

11:57.455 --> 12:00.589
Okay, I lied again.
These are $1,200 jeans.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.070
That's two months' rent.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.550
I know that.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.335
Okay, I lied again.
I didn't know that.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.337
I have no concept of money.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
Why are you saying all this?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.733
Because you deserve the truth.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.606
You shouldn't date
someone like me.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.435
Yeah, I've been trying
to change.

12:20.478 --> 12:24.134
I have an actual job now,
made some real friends,

12:24.178 --> 12:26.789
but deep down,

12:26.833 --> 12:30.271
I don't think I'll ever
be good enough for you.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.665
Got it.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.711
Have a nice life.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.888
That's it?

12:38.932 --> 12:40.063
A guy tells me he's a jerk,

12:40.107 --> 12:41.282
I'm gonna believe him.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.373
Yeah. Makes sense.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.027
What did you expect me to say?

12:47.070 --> 12:49.681
I don't know.
In the movie version,

12:49.725 --> 12:53.076
you'd at least be touched
by my honesty,

12:53.120 --> 12:56.776
and then pull the bus over
and make out with me.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.953
Stand behind the yellow line,
please.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.564
Yeah.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.305
Sorry.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.138
Thank you, Pastor!

13:11.181 --> 13:13.401
Come again, anytime.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.752
He will never come again.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.581
Abishola, what were
you and Kemi thinking?

13:19.624 --> 13:21.409
I'm sorry, Auntie.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.933
We were just trying
to help Morenike.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.630
I'll apologize to the pastor.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.459
You should. Your behavior
was almost as shameful

13:28.503 --> 13:31.549
- as Ogechi's condition.
- Poor Ogechi.

13:31.593 --> 13:34.291
Yes. Good thing her son
is a pharmacist.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.865
Can I get you some tea?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.258
No, thank you.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.868
How about some of this cake?

13:45.912 --> 13:48.044
- No.
- You sure?

13:48.088 --> 13:50.481
There was a lot of fire
and brimstone talk out there,

13:50.525 --> 13:54.616
but this right here is
heaven on a plate.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.060
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.367
No, really.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.369
Even though it was an accident,

14:08.412 --> 14:10.762
I had no right
to share your secret.

14:10.806 --> 14:14.114
Yes, you had no right.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.726
Is there anything
I can do to help?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.601
I've been calling my parents
all day.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.300
No answer every time.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.563
And now all I can do is wonder

14:28.606 --> 14:31.044
if it is because
they are busy,

14:31.087 --> 14:34.656
or because they're never
going to speak to me again.

14:34.699 --> 14:35.875
So, no...

14:37.964 --> 14:40.575
...there is nothing
you can do to help.

14:42.533 --> 14:45.449
Got it.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
I will speak to Bob,
and if he agrees,

14:48.365 --> 14:50.237
I'll invite Morenike
to stay with us.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.629
Why would you do that?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.936
Huh?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.460
I assumed you would not want
the old hens at church

14:56.504 --> 14:58.201
talking about you
if she stays here.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.421
We cannot control
what people say.

15:01.683 --> 15:05.295
And I am one of those old hens.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.559
Yes. But I do not think
Morenike will hide

15:08.603 --> 15:09.952
who she is any longer.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.520
And I promised
I'll support that.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.826
I understand if you do not.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.916
Her life will be
very difficult.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.787
But she is family,

15:18.830 --> 15:21.137
and family should never
turn their back on you.

15:21.181 --> 15:24.140
It happened to us when Tunde
refused to take another wife.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.969
I do not want that pain
for anyone.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.232
Especially one of
- my beloved nieces.
- Mm.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.367
- Morenike will stay here.
- Mm-hmm.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.282
Of course she will.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.153
Mm.
Mm.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.510
Are you still playing this?

15:46.554 --> 15:49.165
We're having fun.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.341
When I was your age,
we had to escape our problems

15:51.385 --> 15:53.561
the old-fashioned way.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.738
Hey, I'm a fan
of the classics, too.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.479
Nice role modeling,
Uncle Doug.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.785
I'm showing him
what not to do.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.874
It's very powerful.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.572
You'll never make
your life better

16:04.615 --> 16:05.790
by sitting around moping.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.618
You gotta go out and live.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.491
I'd have to take a bus
to do that.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.320
Ignore him.

16:13.363 --> 16:16.105
One night I was down on myself
like this one here.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.847
But my girlfriends
dragged me out to go dancing.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.675
I tied one on,
and the next morning

16:20.718 --> 16:23.112
I woke up with a headache
and a future husband.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.375
You never know.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.247
Tied one on?

16:27.290 --> 16:28.988
It means she was drunk.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.339
Drunk and hopeful.
Don't you forget that.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.167
I'm learning a lot here.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.649
What the hell?

16:41.391 --> 16:43.480
Hey, pass me his beer,
would you?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.187
- Hey.
- Get in.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.579
Okay.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.366
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.
Like I said...

16:59.409 --> 17:01.716
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.155
I don't like that you lied,

17:06.199 --> 17:09.115
but I believe you when
you said you want to change.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.986
You do?

17:12.292 --> 17:15.295
What can I say?
I was touched by your honesty.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.079
See? That's what... I'm not finished.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.994
Okay.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.822
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.129
But if you lie to me again,

17:23.172 --> 17:25.870
I'm gonna run you over
with this bus.

17:27.655 --> 17:31.615
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.008
Let's go to dinner.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.837
Right now? Where the hell
am I gonna park the bus?

17:35.880 --> 17:39.014
The place I'm gonna take you,
throw enough cash at it,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.016
they'll valet <i>anything.</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:44.715
Wow.
That was really douchey.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.282
Sorry, I'm still in recovery.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.545
I'm gonna need you to tell me
every time I do that.

17:48.589 --> 17:52.636
Don't worry... I will.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.561
Praise the Lord-o.
Hallelujah.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.128
I said praise the Lord-o!

18:06.172 --> 18:08.217
Hallelujah!

18:08.261 --> 18:10.132
Let us put our hands together.
