00:26.000 --> 00:29.200
- How's my hair?
- Good. Mine?

00:29.200 --> 00:30.800
Solid.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.800
[both] Scorch.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.600
First day of high school, Virg.
We made the big time.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.100
Football games, free periods...
the chicks.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.300
- Derek? You have a bat in the cave.
- Huh?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.200
Boogie fever.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.400
And that was just a test.
Had it been an actual emergency...

00:56.500 --> 00:58.600
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Aww...

00:58.700 --> 01:01.700
Their first high school fight!
My boys are growing up so fast.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.500
- Where does the time go?
- Who cares about the past?

01:04.599 --> 01:08.900
- l'm thinking about my social future.
- Well, l don't want anything to change.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.700
l've got my two best guys
right here, right now.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.300
l'm your favorite though? You can
admit it. He's man enough to take it.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.400
l still can't believe you talked
me into trying out for cheerleading.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.600
You'll do fine.
lt's him l'm worried about.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.300
He's in full freak mode
about football tryouts.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.600
Don't worry, l'll be there
for moral support.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.000
- You mean to goof around?
- Exactly.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.400
This is serious.
You better not embarrass me.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.200
D-rock, l never try to embarrass you.
lt just works out that way.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.900
- [chatter]
- [whistle blows]

01:50.000 --> 01:53.400
- But first, a little boom-bah.
- [all laugh]

01:53.400 --> 01:54.900
[whistle blows]

01:58.000 --> 02:02.300
Relax, Beaugard.
Be the ball, be the ball.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.500
- [boys laughing]
- What's up with that?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.800
[girls practicing cheers]

02:12.900 --> 02:15.200
[Virgil] l'll see you guys later.

02:17.500 --> 02:21.000
- [sighs] OK, that's enough for today.
- No! Wait! l can do this.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.400
Bro, maybe you ought to rest your arm.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.500
- [whistle blows]
- [girls cheering]

02:25.500 --> 02:28.300
- [rumbling, whirring]
- What is that?

02:28.400 --> 02:30.500
[boy] Coming through! Whoa!

02:30.700 --> 02:33.400
Coming through! l can't control it!

02:33.500 --> 02:35.200
l'm really sorry! Look out!

02:35.300 --> 02:38.200
- Whoa!
- [boy shouting]

02:38.200 --> 02:42.100
- [shouting]
- [girls scream]

02:46.800 --> 02:48.700
l'm sorry! Excuse me!

02:48.700 --> 02:50.500
He's chewing up my field!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.900
- lsn't that your neighbor?
- Charlie Tuttle.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.300
This kid in our class
who's nine years old.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.900
He skipped a bunch of grades
because he's a genius.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.100
- [yelling]
- Oh, yeah. A real Einstein.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.000
Get off my field right now!

03:08.100 --> 03:09.500
Stupid dork's going down.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.100
What are you doing? He's going away.
Just ignore him.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.800
Oh!

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
Now that's some accuracy.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.400
Little baby.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.900
Come on, give him a break.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.700
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

03:32.800 --> 03:35.400
Hey, come on!
Hey, Derek?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.800
Derek, if you wanna jump in,
that's cool.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.700
- Derek?
- [boys shouting, cheering]

03:42.600 --> 03:46.300
[Charlie] Put me down!
Put me down!

03:46.400 --> 03:48.500
- Good throw! All right, Derek!
- Nice shot!

03:54.300 --> 03:58.200
Thanks for sticking up for me.
l'm sorry about how it turned out.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.600
Please tell me l don't look
as ridiculous as you do.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.300
lt's not that bad, really.
That's a... that's a nice red on you.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.200
- l'm Charlie Tuttle.
- Virgil Fox.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.300
Nice to meet you.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.800
[sighs]

04:16.899 --> 04:20.200
So, what's the story
with that rocket cart thing?

04:20.300 --> 04:23.200
l always get a hard time on the bus
and l hypothesized

04:23.200 --> 04:26.800
a rocket-propulsion all-terrain cart
would help avoid embarrassment.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.000
Uh-huh. And how's that
working out for you?

04:45.700 --> 04:47.900
lt's working great!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.900
My emotion modulator
actually allows me to understand

04:52.000 --> 04:55.600
what Albert Felinestein is trying to
communicate with his various meows!

04:55.700 --> 04:59.200
- lsn't that amazing?
- [boys chattering]

04:59.300 --> 05:02.600
Virgil? Hey! Earth to Virgil.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.200
Virg! Don't you think, Virgil?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.600
Virgil? Aren't you excited?

05:09.700 --> 05:12.200
Yes, Charlie, l'm thrilled
that you talk to your cat.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.800
Um, l'm not entirely certain, but l
believe you may be employing sarcasm.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.900
Charlie, what do you want from me?
Your inventions always work.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.200
l can only act so surprised
every time you figure out

05:25.300 --> 05:27.900
how to power your house
with tartar sauce.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.100
[snorts] lt's cocktail sauce.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.600
You know what would make me happy?
lf you built something useful.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.500
By useful, l mean something that
would make me rich and popular. Or both.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.500
Hey, you can't
ride that thing on the...

05:41.100 --> 05:46.000
Hey, great bike. Lots of shiny,
chrome, gear-y things.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.800
[Charlie muffled]

05:50.800 --> 05:52.500
[bell rings]

05:52.800 --> 05:54.800
[chatter]

05:59.400 --> 06:01.300
[chatter, laughter]

06:01.800 --> 06:06.100
Did you know that the contents of
pudding actually makes you grow taller?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.200
- lt does.
- That's why you're so tall.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.600
[boy] lt's the electrolytes
and everything.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.300
Thumbs down... and go!

06:13.400 --> 06:15.400
[slurping]

06:15.500 --> 06:17.200
Yes! l win!

06:17.300 --> 06:21.000
Senior year and l'm still
eating at the dork table.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.900
No offense, guys. l do enjoy
the stimulating conversation.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.700
Hey, none taken.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.400
But seriously, how did it come to this?

06:31.800 --> 06:35.000
Let's see, maybe your plight
has something to do with

06:35.100 --> 06:38.600
being stripped, dressed in mini skirts,
and hung from the school mascot.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.800
A picture made the cover
of the yearbook. Three years in a row.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.000
- And on all the local news stations.
- And the Spanish Channel.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.800
Ah yes, the incident
l will one day be explaining

06:48.800 --> 06:51.200
to a very expensive therapist.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.600
Hey, Hummingbird.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.800
[stammering]

06:55.800 --> 06:58.600
That's Charlie speak for ''hello.''

06:58.700 --> 07:02.600
Um, excuse me, miss.
Why did you call him ''Hummingbird?''

07:02.600 --> 07:05.100
Oh, l love birds. All kinds of birds.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.100
Big birds, little birds.
l'm even the official secretary

07:08.100 --> 07:12.200
for the local chapter of the Junior
Bird Buddies of America. Such an honor!

07:12.300 --> 07:14.000
Anyway, gotta run.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.300
Fix that.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.000
Well, that explains it.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.700
Jeanette has been sweating you
for two years. What's your deal?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.300
Forget it. l'm married to science.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.900
Hey, congratulations, buddy.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.600
Pardon me, gents.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.200
Ah, soda.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.700
l hear if you leave a penny in that
stuff for a week it comes out shiny?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.600
l was actually planning on drinking it.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.200
Well, never mind then.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.000
So, um, how are you, Virg?

07:57.100 --> 07:58.800
l didn't see you much this summer.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.900
Oh, you know, l was doing a lot of
mountain climbing, jet skiing...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.800
- Video games?
- l didn't leave the couch. You?

08:05.900 --> 08:08.600
[scoffs] The usual, pool parties,
cheerleading camp.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.700
But l did take this awesome
architecture class.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.400
Oh, that's cool.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.700
l remember you made a gingerbread house
that had ten rooms...

08:16.700 --> 08:19.600
- And walk-in closets.
- Took us six months to eat it.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.700
- [bell rings]
- Oh, well...

08:21.800 --> 08:25.500
Well, l have calculus. Hate it. Need it.
Can't be an architect without it.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.000
l got Public Speaking.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.800
Hate it. Need it.
Can't be a game show host without it.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.700
There's a good reason Tesla's biographer

08:39.700 --> 08:41.200
There's a good reason Tesla's biographer

08:41.299 --> 08:44.000
named his book
A Man Out of Time.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.600
Tesla was so far advanced
over his contemporaries,

08:47.700 --> 08:50.500
that they often derided...

08:50.500 --> 08:53.100
[chuckles] ...they often
derided him as...

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
Miss...

08:55.100 --> 09:00.000
Jocelyn, is it too much to ask that
you not do your nails while l lecture?

09:00.100 --> 09:03.100
Sorry. [sighs]
When are you done?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.500
- [class laughs]
- [door opens]

09:05.600 --> 09:07.100
- Excuse me.
- Ah, Mr. Tuttle.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.300
l believe you're here for
your booster chair.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.800
- l'll get it later. AV Club emergency.
- [class laughs]

09:13.800 --> 09:15.800
l need Virgil Fox right away!

09:15.900 --> 09:18.500
- Virgil Fox?
- He's out sick.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.100
- l heard he might not make it.
- Very funny, Mr. Fox.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.500
You can pick up your hall pass
on your way out.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.900
That's it. l'm moving to Paraguay.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.300
- Ever really looked at our mascot?
- [Charlie] Forget the hall pass.

09:32.300 --> 09:36.500
Remember that rocket-propulsion all
terrain cart the day of the incident?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.300
Thanks for mentioning it again.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.900
lt's been ten minutes
since someone brought it up.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.800
Listen, it ties together. That
invention may have not been a success,

09:44.900 --> 09:49.600
but one element of the design was
proven viable. The quantum accelerator.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.300
Remember that physics, new reality,
many worlds theory kick?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.500
l started building my own theory
based on all of that work,

09:58.600 --> 10:02.000
incorporating my proven hypothesis
of quantum acceleration.

10:02.100 --> 10:05.000
l put one of the school's computers
on permanent reserve.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.000
The DSL has been doing all the work.

10:07.100 --> 10:10.300
And moments ago, l uploaded
the last piece of the puzzle.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.700
Commander Tuttle on the bridge!

10:18.700 --> 10:21.200
Dude, no way l'm saluting you.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.100
Fine. At ease.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.800
What l'm about to show you is very,

10:34.800 --> 10:38.600
very, very top secret.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.700
We have to keep this just between us.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.300
Check it out.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.400
[computer whirring]

10:51.800 --> 10:53.400
Yeah?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.300
What you're looking at

10:56.300 --> 11:00.600
is a successful simulation
of practical time travel.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.700
[stammers] What are you doing?

11:08.800 --> 11:12.400
l'm trying to stop any more of your
brain from leaking out your ears.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.600
What?

11:14.700 --> 11:18.400
Come on, yesterday you said
l should build something useful.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
Well, time travel is useful.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.900
Charlie, you're 1 4 years old.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.500
You're two years away
from your driver's license,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.800
you still call your underwear
''underpants''.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.000
l should believe
you built a time machine?

11:30.200 --> 11:35.400
Yes! And based on my specifications
a person could travel up to 48 hours

11:35.500 --> 11:37.200
- into the past!
- That's weak.

11:38.300 --> 11:42.000
Pardon me, how's your
time travel formula coming along?

11:46.200 --> 11:48.800
lt's all about light, right?
Nothing moves faster.

11:48.900 --> 11:52.400
Well, my hypothesis suggests that
you can time travel on a beam of light.

11:52.500 --> 11:56.400
From any light source.
Even light from a slide projector.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.300
A slide projector?
Like a regular slide projector?

11:59.400 --> 12:02.300
Did l say regular? No, l didn't.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.100
What we're talking about
is a complex amalgamation

12:05.200 --> 12:08.700
of electronic components and
internal combustion mechanics.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.200
Which you know nothing about,
by the way.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.400
We'll have to find a hardware guy.
l don't see this as a problem.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.300
Hey, Chickadee! What's shakin'?

12:17.900 --> 12:20.800
You have to excuse Charlie.
He's nervous around girls.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.300
- No, l'm not!
- Oh, it's cool, l like shy boys.

12:24.400 --> 12:29.100
- Um, what's in the bowl?
- Meringue. The assignment.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.100
[laughs] Here, take mine.
l'll make a new one.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.700
- Did you see that?
- What?

12:39.800 --> 12:43.100
Dude, she gave you meringue.
That's huge.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.800
l just need to know, are you
going to help me with this or not?

12:49.800 --> 12:53.100
Are you gonna be part of something,
make history,

12:53.200 --> 12:55.900
or sit on the sidelines
and be a passive observer?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.200
OK, look, l'll make you a deal.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.900
l'll help with your machine
and find a hardware guy.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
But when we try it out
for the first time,

13:04.100 --> 13:06.700
we use it for whatever l want to do.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.300
- All right.
- Right.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.800
But Virgil, this hardware person
we need is tricky.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.300
Why?

13:16.300 --> 13:19.000
Because he not only needs
to be gifted mechanically,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.700
but also, let's say,
require a certain moral flexibility.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.800
- Lives on the fringes of society.
- OK. Well...

13:26.100 --> 13:29.300
- How about him?
- Zeke? Are you serious?

13:29.300 --> 13:31.800
Look at him. He's, he's...

13:31.900 --> 13:34.500
Perfect. You know, at those
monster truck shows,

13:34.600 --> 13:38.800
there's always that giant metal dinosaur
that breathes fire and destroys cars?

13:38.900 --> 13:41.800
- l've seen the commercials.
- He and his dad build those.

13:42.700 --> 13:47.100
Killer-saurus. 1 5,000 pounds
of jaw-crushing force!

13:47.200 --> 13:51.000
- l get it.
- Look out folks, it's car-nivorous!

13:51.100 --> 13:52.800
l get it! l get it.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.000
[cat meows]

14:13.400 --> 14:16.200
Your cat is freaking me out.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.200
lt's not my cat. lt's his.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.300
His name is Albert Felinestein.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.100
That's the dumbest name for a cat
l've ever heard.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.100
Couldn't agree more, Zeke.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.300
Zekester.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.200
[stammers] l hate
when people bend names too.

14:34.200 --> 14:38.700
Like ''Virgilosity.'' l'm like,
''Come on, people, it's Virgil.''

14:38.800 --> 14:40.500
l'm going to stop talking now.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.200
- Amy, no! This is a private meeting.
- Oh, l'm sorry.

14:45.300 --> 14:49.900
l just came down to watch TV. But Mom
did mention you had a new friend over?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.500
A boy.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.300
Ew, he's gross! Geez, Virgil,
why can't you bring home cute boys?

14:57.400 --> 15:00.900
Amy, leave or l tell mom you're doing
makeovers on the hamsters again.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.300
Chill. l'm outta here. lt's like
l walked into an ugly contest.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.800
- She's a charmer.
- OK.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.200
OK, this thing, this, uh,

15:12.300 --> 15:16.400
quantum integration to the physical
properties of light projection,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.600
looks like it could work.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.900
Yeah, Mongo read.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.900
- OK. So you'll help us construct it?
- Why not?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.800
l'm always up for a challenge.
And free bean dip.

15:34.700 --> 15:38.300
Um, you have a little...

15:38.400 --> 15:42.000
- No.
- ...some bean...

15:43.400 --> 15:46.700
Do that again and l weld you
to the crosstown bus.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.400
Have you thought how
we're going to use this thing?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.500
The first journey back
will obviously be a monumental event,

16:07.600 --> 16:11.200
and our specific goal on that journey
should be appropriately grandiose.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.900
l got it. Two words, gentlemen:

16:14.000 --> 16:16.500
- The lottery.
- Nice.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.400
Absolutely not, Virgil!
l refuse to agree to that.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.100
Oh, but you already did.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.100
You said that if l helped you,

16:23.200 --> 16:26.700
we'd use the machine for
whatever l wanted to. No do-overs!

16:26.800 --> 16:28.400
[laughs]

16:28.500 --> 16:30.900
Do you want to time travel
or don't you?

16:31.900 --> 16:33.400
- Fine.
- Yes!

16:33.500 --> 16:37.100
You're not going to be able to
just plug this thing into a wall outlet.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.500
- This is gonna take major amperage.
- Not to mention privacy and space.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.100
l know the place. lt's perfect.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.000
lt's completely perfect.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.800
Come on, come on!

16:50.900 --> 16:52.400
- Oh!
- Vice Principal Tolkan,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.600
we need to talk
about starting a new club.

16:54.700 --> 16:58.500
No can do. We're completely
maxed-out on classroom space.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.300
The Future Fonduers of America
were the last ones in.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
ls that Chester in the vending machine?

17:03.500 --> 17:06.000
- Hey, fellas.
- Does anyone have four quarters?

17:06.099 --> 17:08.900
- lt's not taking my dollar.
- You going to do something?

17:09.000 --> 17:13.800
Like what? Change the way
high school works? No gentlemen.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.200
Everything in the world
has an order.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.000
There are those who stuff others
into vending machines,

17:19.099 --> 17:22.900
and those who get stuffed into vending
machines. lt's the way the system works.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.900
lt's in the Vice Principal's handbook.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Anyway, about our club,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
- we were wondering...
- Room 77! We want room 77!

17:32.100 --> 17:33.900
lmpossible. Never gonna happen.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.200
- [machine whirring]
- [grunts] Like this.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.500
[grunting]

17:41.800 --> 17:46.100
Perhaps we can convince you
to reconsider.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.600
Huh?

17:52.900 --> 17:54.500
[Tolkan muttering]

17:56.200 --> 17:58.800
Done.

18:00.700 --> 18:04.100
All right, scooch over to your left.
l'm going after the Pretzel Nubs.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.100
[Charlie] The north wing was knocked
down to make the football field,

18:10.200 --> 18:11.900
which we're underneath now.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.000
Room 77 was built to be the school's
fallout shelter back in the 1 950's.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.500
l think it's right through here.

18:47.700 --> 18:51.200
[Virgil] Someone call
Extreme Classroom Makeover.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.800
This is a disaster.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.500
Got great bones, though.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.400
[? Aly & AJ: Like Whoa]

20:30.100 --> 20:31.700
[whirring]

20:32.700 --> 20:34.800
OK! This is it.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.100
One small step for man,

20:39.200 --> 20:41.400
but one very large...

20:42.700 --> 20:44.900
No, that's not it.
lt's one small step for...

20:45.000 --> 20:46.100
Dude, just turn it on.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.300
[powers up, rumbling]

21:00.800 --> 21:02.400
[sound intensifies]

21:04.200 --> 21:06.100
[roaring]

21:06.200 --> 21:08.500
Good gravy!

21:15.800 --> 21:18.300
- Scratch!
- lt's scorch.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.800
- Right.
- So who wants go first?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.300
Be the world's first time traveler?

21:25.400 --> 21:29.700
l just ate a meatball sandwich.
l might get cramps.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.100
Yeah and um...
this is my new favorite shirt.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.900
[typing]

21:34.900 --> 21:36.000
[cat meows]

21:44.200 --> 21:48.000
- [Zeke] Get the goggles.
- [Charlie muttering]

21:49.800 --> 21:52.700
- OK, you're good.
- Come on, no biting.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.400
- OK.
- OK.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.900
[cat howls]

21:57.000 --> 21:59.700
- [Charlie still muttering]
- [cat howling]

22:01.500 --> 22:03.400
Where's Albert Felinestein?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.200
Did you...?

22:07.500 --> 22:11.200
Hello? Vortex! He could die!

22:11.300 --> 22:13.400
You were OK with me going in there.
What...

22:13.400 --> 22:15.200
- But l was gonna...
- Hang on!

22:15.500 --> 22:18.000
- [cat howls]
- Whoa, a catsicle!

22:18.100 --> 22:20.700
Virgil, time travel is unpredictable.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.000
The temperatures can be highly variable!

22:23.100 --> 22:25.600
Guys? Take a look at the watch.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.400
8:43.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.200
8:44.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.300
An exact one-minute differential.
That means...

22:35.400 --> 22:39.100
Your cat is the first
time-traveler in history!

22:39.100 --> 22:40.600
[both] We did it!

22:40.700 --> 22:42.000
[both shouting]

22:44.800 --> 22:44.900
- [beeping]
- [keyboard]

22:44.900 --> 22:46.900
- [beeping]
- [keyboard]

22:58.000 --> 22:59.700
[beeping continues]

23:01.700 --> 23:03.300
[sighs]

23:04.800 --> 23:07.600
Huh. That's bizarre.

23:07.700 --> 23:12.100
l've got a reading from the Summerton
sensor, pretty much off the charts,

23:12.200 --> 23:14.600
but nothing around it. Hmm.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.900
You think they got
anything on that upstairs?

23:17.000 --> 23:21.100
Nah, they would've called right away.
Probably another computer glitch.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.100
They give us basement dwellers
the lame-o equipment.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.100
Plus all the good snacks are upstairs.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.200
l mean, seriously,
try one of these, they're stale.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.000
[sniffs]

23:36.500 --> 23:39.400
[Derek] Steph, what do l have to do
to make you believe me?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.200
She's just teaching me French.

23:41.300 --> 23:45.800
Hmm, Jocelyn Lee is tutoring you
in French, and that's all?

23:45.900 --> 23:48.900
[speaks French]

23:50.100 --> 23:53.100
See, that's why l need her help.
l have no idea what you said.

23:53.100 --> 23:56.700
l said, ''My boyfriend
is a lying cheesebrain.''

23:56.800 --> 24:01.200
Come on, Steph, Jocelyn's hot
but she's a total bottom feeder.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.800
l would never go there.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.000
- l know.
- l'll call you later, OK?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.700
[Stephanie] OK.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.000
- Oh, Steph, l didn't see you there.
- Oh, hey.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.800
- You studying?
- l was looking for a pencil sharpener.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.300
Oh, l have one.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.100
Do you have a pencil?

24:25.100 --> 24:27.600
Same old Virg. Never changes.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.000
Well, you haven't changed much either.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.800
Does your hair still frizz up
when you run through the sprinkler?

24:32.800 --> 24:35.600
Totally. This morning before school l
set up the Wiggly Worm on the lawn...

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
l love the Wiggly Worm.
Remember that time l almost drowned?

24:38.700 --> 24:41.100
Because Derek shoved the nozzle
up your nose.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.600
He tried to run away and
cracked his head on the telephone pole.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
[librarian] Shh!

24:51.700 --> 24:54.300
- l miss us.
- Tres amigos.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.600
Yeah.

24:56.900 --> 25:00.600
You know, Derek really did
try to stop those football players.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.700
But you know how seniors are.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.800
Anyway, l know he feels bad
about what happened that day.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.900
You know, they say that people who
don't let go of the past die faster.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.500
And get more acne.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.400
l'm sweating like five hogs.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.600
Due to irregularities in temperature,
we should be prepared.

25:23.700 --> 25:27.100
OK, l got the winning
lottery numbers right here.

25:27.200 --> 25:31.500
To guarantee that the vortex maintains
stability long enough to return safely,

25:31.700 --> 25:33.800
we only have ten minutes
on the other side.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.900
Otherwise, we run the risk of exploding.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.100
That's funny,
l thought you said exploding.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.500
l did. Activating grid...

25:46.400 --> 25:49.400
Um... what's with the grappling hook?

25:49.500 --> 25:51.500
You making fun of the hook?

25:51.600 --> 25:54.500
What? No, no. Love, love the hook.

26:02.100 --> 26:05.000
Next stop... funky town.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.100
Whoa!

26:10.200 --> 26:12.800
[distorted yell]

26:17.800 --> 26:20.800
l just remembered.
l forgot to triple check the...

26:20.800 --> 26:24.500
[stammering] Can we talk about this?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.500
[yelling]

26:44.400 --> 26:47.500
- [grunting]
- [distorted yelling]

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
[screams]

26:50.200 --> 26:52.600
[Zeke yelling]

26:56.500 --> 26:58.400
We gotta work on our landings.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.700
1 :27 yesterday. We did it.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.900
Oh yes, we did it.
We're time travelers.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.500
? We're time travelers
We're time travelers

27:09.600 --> 27:13.000
? We're time, we're time, we're time
we're time, we're time travelers

27:13.100 --> 27:16.500
- ? We're time travelers
- ls he OK?

27:16.600 --> 27:19.800
- He really loves science.
- [Charlie continues singing]

27:19.800 --> 27:23.200
? We're time travelers
We're time travelers

27:26.200 --> 27:28.900
[mechanical whirring sounds]

27:30.900 --> 27:34.900
One lottery ticket, please.
These are the numbers.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.200
- We're feeling lucky.
- Uh-huh.

27:38.300 --> 27:42.900
Are you feeling like you have l.D.? You
need to be 1 8 to buy a lottery ticket.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.500
Hi. We need to ask you a favor.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.600
- [mechanical whirring]
- He wants a tip.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.900
Here, OK.

27:58.900 --> 28:03.500
We need you to buy us a lottery ticket
with these numbers.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.400
What do you say?

28:09.300 --> 28:11.300
- Tip him.
- Oh.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.800
lt's all l got, OK?

28:18.400 --> 28:21.400
You guys. You guys! We have two minutes
to get back to school!

28:22.100 --> 28:24.400
New plan. We'll meet you here
tomorrow at 1 2:00.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.400
Hang on to the ticket till then, OK?

28:27.400 --> 28:28.900
OK.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.900
OK, that's the second fluctuation,
of the same exact magnitude,

28:36.100 --> 28:38.400
at the same exact location.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.100
l'm telling you,
it's a technical glitch.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.700
What else could it be?

28:42.800 --> 28:46.300
You think they all of a sudden started
drilling for oil in Summerton?

28:46.400 --> 28:48.500
Now, let's just
get back to work, all right?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Can you help me un-knot this?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.800
- [band playing]
- [excited chatter]

29:01.400 --> 29:03.800
Cool. l can't believe he won.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.900
An incredible story
from Summerton this afternoon.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.700
The winner of the State Lottery,
announced last night,

29:09.800 --> 29:13.700
has turned out to be
none other than Robot Man.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.000
Told you.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.400
OK, so tomorrow we go back in time
and get a new lottery ticket.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.900
- But this time, we be sure...
- No. Virgil, it's wrong.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.600
lt's cheating.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.900
You're right. lt is cheating.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.600
New plan. We go on TV with
the machine, do an infomercial,

29:40.700 --> 29:44.500
sell like 8,000 of them and instantly
become rich and humongously popular!

29:44.500 --> 29:46.900
And they say you can't buy happiness.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.300
Listen to me. lf anyone finds out
about this time machine

29:51.400 --> 29:55.100
it will be the end
of me, you, and Zeke.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.400
The end!

29:56.500 --> 29:59.200
Can you back up?
l have personal space issues.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.800
Oh, no.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.700
- [bell rings]
- Think outside the box.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.500
There's an important use
for the machine.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.400
What's more important
than being rich and popular?

30:18.500 --> 30:22.400
Kidding! l'm kidding... mostly.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.300
Hey, Chester. Looking for these?

30:38.400 --> 30:41.600
Hey, gimme those!

30:42.800 --> 30:45.100
[crowd laughing]

30:48.600 --> 30:52.100
lf you're trying out a new look,
let me say it's not working.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.800
Those kids stole my clothes.
Can you help me get them back?

30:56.700 --> 30:58.600
l'd like to. Really, l would.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.400
But that would mean altering the
delicate social system at the school.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.600
So... good luck.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.300
Virgil, l just had a brilliant idea.

31:12.900 --> 31:16.700
- You mean use the time machine to...
- Exactly.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.400
- Starch!
- Again, scorch.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.800
Did you read the instructions
l e-mailed you?

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
l'm sorry.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.000
OK, so let me get this straight.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.800
You're saying we become
like silent heroes

31:35.800 --> 31:38.400
- to the un-cool?
- Look around.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.000
We live in a world
where mere minutes

31:41.100 --> 31:43.700
can make or break
a person's entire future.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.400
Take what happened freshman year.
Had l known it would ruin my life,

31:47.500 --> 31:50.300
- l never would've done it.
- Tell us how you really feel?

31:50.400 --> 31:54.300
Think about all the kids at this school
like Chester, like us.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.400
We all live in constant fear
of humiliation,

31:57.500 --> 32:00.800
because we happen to be smaller,
less coordinated, whatever.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.900
But we can change that.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.300
The Minutemen must use their powers
for truth and justice.

32:07.900 --> 32:10.500
And then we focus on getting rich.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.700
Again, l'm kidding.

32:13.700 --> 32:17.700
- And who are the Minutemen?
- We. Us.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.200
The all-important minutes in time.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.400
- Clever, right?
- Sort of.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.100
Not really.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.100
Forget it! None of these remote
control hookups are gonna work.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.700
This is no good.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.600
We have to make adjustments
while we're back in time.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.300
Well, then, l guess one of us
is going to hang back.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.900
- Not it!
- Not it.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.100
Not it! Aww! Dang it!

32:47.600 --> 32:49.900
- Unfair, l invented the machine.
- OK.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.300
- Re-do. Not it!
- Not it!

32:52.400 --> 32:55.500
Not it!
Double dang it!

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
[Jeanette] Not it! That was fun.

32:58.700 --> 33:03.100
- Not it!
- Uh, Jeanette, what are you doing here?

33:03.100 --> 33:05.500
l was looking for a club to join
and l saw yours.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.100
- ''The Back To The Future Fan Club.''
- Oh, right.

33:09.100 --> 33:12.100
l love that movie, even though
l never really saw it.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.400
But l totally love
the idea of time travel.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.000
l mean, it's just so...
science fiction-y.

33:18.100 --> 33:21.100
Actually Jeanette,
your timing is interesting.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.300
No, it isn't, Virgil.
What are you doing?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.900
Uh... Excuse us.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.500
[arguing in whispers]

33:29.500 --> 33:33.000
- Shh!
- [Charlie] lt's gonna mess up...

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
[inaudible] Hi.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.600
- No, no, no!
- Listen to me.

33:37.700 --> 33:41.200
- [Charlie repeats] No, no, no.
- [Virgil] Think about what's going on.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.100
- [Charlie screams]
- [all arguing]

33:44.200 --> 33:45.500
[Zeke] OK.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.000
Jeanette, have a seat.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.400
[machine whirring]

34:03.200 --> 34:04.100
Whoa!

34:04.200 --> 34:07.400
- OK, you know what to do, right?
- Sure thing, Puffin.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
Um... but first...

34:12.800 --> 34:15.300
We so have to do something
about those outfits.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.699
[boys] Huh?

34:21.100 --> 34:23.199
There you go. That's better.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.699
- Where did you get these?
- My Dad just bought Ski World.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.600
How lucky is that? lf he still owned
The Shrimp 'n Waffle Hut

34:30.699 --> 34:32.699
that would be like, no help at all.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.400
l've been looking
for something form-fitting

34:37.400 --> 34:39.500
that would highlight
these massive guns.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.000
- You're built like a chihuahua.
- You look like a yeti.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.400
- You think l don't know what a yeti is?
- Do you?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.600
- Virgil, grow up.
- Me, grow up? You grow up!

34:46.699 --> 34:49.000
- Don't yell at Charlie!
- l'm not! You stop yelling!

34:49.100 --> 34:52.000
- [distorted shout]
- [Charlie] l never yell at people.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.000
[Zeke distorted] Stop yelling!

34:54.100 --> 34:57.100
l never thought time travel
would involve so much bickering.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.200
Oh, man!

35:05.800 --> 35:08.000
[muttering]

35:08.100 --> 35:10.100
Hold it right there, friend.

35:12.700 --> 35:16.500
Uh, if you guys are gonna pick on me,
you'll have to take a number.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.700
- Don't be afraid.
- We're here to help.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
What's going on, fellas?

35:32.100 --> 35:36.800
Oh, you can keep those.
l got myself some new threads.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.100
Who were those snowsuit guys?

35:48.900 --> 35:50.600
After twenty years of service

35:50.700 --> 35:54.000
the board gives you either a gold watch
or one of these.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.100
My sweet little castle.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.900
Don't touch it. lt's going in my office
in a bulletproof glass case.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.900
lt's delicate.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.300
[all grunting]

36:05.700 --> 36:07.700
[groaning]

36:08.100 --> 36:09.600
[shouts]

36:26.100 --> 36:27.600
Did we win? Did we win?

36:27.800 --> 36:30.700
Oh, we won all right. We won big.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.500
[Tolkan on loudspeaker]
Nurse Ratchett and Coach Bob

36:33.600 --> 36:36.900
have seen it before
and they assure me it's not contagious.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.100
One more thing, before we wrap up
this morning's announcements.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.000
Recently, a group of students
dressed in snowsuits,

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
disrupted a gym class.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.500
More importantly, they destroyed
my precious diorama.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.900
Whoever you students are,
let me make it perfectly clear

36:53.000 --> 36:57.200
that once you are identified,
you will be severely punished.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.400
That is all.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.000
Cool. We're outlaws.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.300
- On the run from Johnny Law.
- Naughty Neds.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.100
That's what my mom calls me
when l forget to floss.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.400
[chatter, laughter]

37:25.000 --> 37:29.800
Perfect, except l think
that's a dangling participle.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.800
l hate it when those things dangle.

37:33.400 --> 37:37.500
Pick up in five minutes, OK?

37:37.600 --> 37:41.100
l'm totally tired and need to sit down.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.300
You think maybe you could
just bring the food to our table?

37:44.300 --> 37:48.100
You know, bend the rules
just a little bit?

37:48.200 --> 37:53.200
Eugene von Hoserberg.

37:53.200 --> 37:57.100
- Uh... You bet.
- Great.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.700
So, do you think you get it?

38:05.800 --> 38:07.600
Um... yeah.

38:07.900 --> 38:11.600
[girls chattering]

38:16.900 --> 38:18.500
Here you go...

38:18.500 --> 38:20.300
[grunts]

38:23.300 --> 38:24.800
Nice one, dork.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.200
Way to go, Eugene.

38:38.700 --> 38:42.300
Eugene von Hoserberg.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.800
- Uh... You bet.
- Great.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.000
- Here you go.
- [girl] All right! The Snowsuit Guys!

39:00.100 --> 39:02.100
[grunts]

39:03.400 --> 39:05.100
[all scream]

39:08.400 --> 39:10.500
All right, the Snowsuit guys.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.900
[boy] Way to go, Snow Guys.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.600
Way to go, Eugene.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.600
Whoa... deja vu.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.000
The jig is up, Ski Club!
Or should l say...

39:35.400 --> 39:37.400
...Snowsuit Guys?

40:59.300 --> 41:01.400
Yeah, l party with them
all the time.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.000
Who's this we're talking about, Eugene?

41:04.100 --> 41:07.900
Oh, hey, Virgil.
Yeah, it's nobody you know.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.500
l'm just talking about
the Snowsuit Guys.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.400
Oh, yeah, l heard about them.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.500
They're supposed to be total heroes.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.600
Oh, and l hear the medium height guy,
is extremely hilarious

41:17.600 --> 41:19.900
and devastatingly handsome...

41:21.500 --> 41:24.400
And they're called the Minutemen,
not the Snowsuit Guys!

41:24.900 --> 41:25.900
[scoffs]

41:28.600 --> 41:31.300
Anyone notice that Eugene
has copped an attitude?

41:31.400 --> 41:33.400
You want attitude, check out Chester.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.200
Am l a trend setter?
You tell me, amigo.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.900
l mean, who else are these kids
supposed to look up to to set trends?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.300
Those doorknobs?

41:42.900 --> 41:45.600
Virgil? Virgil, Virgil!

41:45.700 --> 41:48.600
l almost called you,
but l wanted to tell you in person.

41:48.700 --> 41:52.200
- What? What's going on?
- l got accepted into UC Belmont!

41:52.300 --> 41:54.400
- [Stephanie giggles]
- Get out!

41:54.500 --> 41:58.600
But it's not a done deal yet. l applied
for a cheerleading scholarship.

41:58.700 --> 42:02.700
They're sending a scout, which means l
have to work on my pyramid dismount.

42:02.700 --> 42:05.700
That's so cool! l'm so psyched for you!
You love that school!

42:05.800 --> 42:08.300
- [Derek] Steph!
- Oh, Derek.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.800
- Oh.
- Gotta tell him about the scholarship.

42:10.800 --> 42:14.100
So, l'll see you later, Virg. Bye.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.800
Charlie, what's wrong?

42:21.900 --> 42:25.800
OK, there's something l haven't told
you about the time travel formula.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.100
Remember there was one last piece of
the equation that evaded me for years,

42:31.200 --> 42:33.100
until l found what l was looking for

42:33.200 --> 42:36.500
through a round-the-clock
internet downloading procedure.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.300
- He was hacking.
- lt gets worse.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.600
- l stole it from NASA.
- You robbed NASA?

42:46.500 --> 42:48.800
[all grunting]

42:48.900 --> 42:51.900
- lt's not as bad as it sounds.
- Yes, it's worse than it sounds.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.300
The files were from the 1 960s,
they were defunct.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.800
- No one has touched them for decades.
- This is bad, real bad.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.800
- We could go to prison.
- Just so you know,

42:59.900 --> 43:03.300
if we do go to prison, and we share the
same cell, l snore like a chain saw.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.300
- Great.
- This won't be a problem

43:05.300 --> 43:09.400
as long as we don't use the machine
for awhile and lay low.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.000
Mmm, l dropped a grape.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.700
[chatter]

43:30.500 --> 43:32.100
[girl] So, how did it happen?

43:41.700 --> 43:46.000
Forget it. lt's terrible Stephanie
fell off the top of the pyramid.

43:46.100 --> 43:50.500
But forget it. l mean, we all said
that we were being watched, right?

43:50.800 --> 43:52.400
The heat is on.

43:52.500 --> 43:55.700
lf we don't help Stephanie she
could lose out on her scholarship.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.800
- We have to go back.
- 'Cause you have a creepy crush on her!

43:58.900 --> 44:00.900
Oh! Creepy crush. l vote yes!

44:00.900 --> 44:04.400
Charlie, you said it yourself, the
files you hacked into were defunct.

44:04.500 --> 44:08.000
l'll bet nobody knows they're missing.
Need l remind you?

44:08.100 --> 44:11.400
We are the Minutemen,
not the Weeniemen.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.700
Don't be late for dinner!

44:31.500 --> 44:34.400
[girls chattering]

44:34.500 --> 44:35.700
[whistle blows]

44:42.100 --> 44:43.800
OK, we need a plan of action.

44:43.900 --> 44:47.000
- We've got to be extremely discreet.
- And bold and decisive.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.200
- Zeke, what do you think?
- Where'd he go?

44:49.300 --> 44:51.400
- Zeke?
- Where'd he go?

44:52.900 --> 44:55.400
At least we got
the bold and decisive part.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.300
Go, go, go!

45:06.800 --> 45:08.600
Come back here!
Come on.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.500
Snowsuit Guys.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.700
- What's up, Gene.
- Hey, dudes. Mind if l hack in?

45:32.000 --> 45:33.800
Stop! Hold it right there!

45:34.900 --> 45:37.800
Go Rams! Whoo!

45:42.100 --> 45:43.500
[Stephanie screaming]

45:46.500 --> 45:48.800
- [both grunt]
- [girl] Good catch!

45:48.900 --> 45:51.800
[panting] Wow.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.000
l don't know who you are,
but you're amazing.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.400
Get out.

45:59.700 --> 46:02.700
[people chanting] Snowsuit Guys,
Snowsuit Guys!

46:04.500 --> 46:07.800
- [all cheering]
- Get... whoa!

46:07.900 --> 46:09.400
- [thud]
- [grunts]

46:11.800 --> 46:12.800
[growls]

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
- All right!
- [boy] Yeah! Snowsuit Guys!

46:15.500 --> 46:18.000
And we're called the Minutemen!

46:18.100 --> 46:19.700
Yeehaw!

46:29.900 --> 46:33.400
According to my calculations,
you guys are in my way.

46:33.500 --> 46:38.200
- Leave us alone, Chester.
- l'm not fond of your hat.

46:38.500 --> 46:42.300
- Excuse me, what is going on here?
- Chester keeps harassing us.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.200
- Shut up, dirtball.
- Everyone, settle down.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.600
Chester, last l remember you were
at the bottom of the food chain,

46:49.700 --> 46:53.200
and l will not tolerate students
leapfrogging to a higher social status.

46:53.300 --> 46:55.500
So you come with me.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.000
- The Ram's Horn?
- Thanks.

47:01.100 --> 47:02.800
- Sure.
- can l have one?

47:03.300 --> 47:05.800
- ''Robot Man Sues Old Lady''?
- Virgil, this is bad.

47:05.900 --> 47:09.100
We are changing the outcome
of things we never planned on.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.600
- Our jumps cause a chain reaction.
- How so?

47:11.600 --> 47:14.600
Chester getting in trouble.
That's never happened before.

47:14.700 --> 47:19.300
Robot men suing old ladies?
[groans] lt's a world gone mad!

47:21.200 --> 47:22.900
Mad l tell you!

47:26.800 --> 47:30.400
Global warming.
He's really freaked out.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.300
Hey, you, uh, need a hand?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.500
Uh... Steph.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.300
Um, not, not really.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.500
- What are you...?
- l figure it's the least l can do,

47:46.600 --> 47:48.500
- to thank you.
- For what?

47:48.600 --> 47:51.500
For saving me. Snowsuit Guy.

47:52.500 --> 47:56.300
- What? Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, don't even try it, Virg.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.800
''Get out?'' Please.

47:58.800 --> 48:03.300
You, Charlie, and Zeke Thompson

48:03.400 --> 48:05.200
- are the Snowsuit Guys.
- Steph...

48:05.300 --> 48:09.000
l knew it! That is so cool! l figured
it out because l started thinking.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.800
The kids you helped, it was before
something bad was about to happen,

48:11.900 --> 48:13.700
- like with me.
- That is ridiculous.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.500
How are we gonna know when
something bad is gonna happen?

48:16.600 --> 48:19.500
That's exactly what l asked myself.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.800
l thought about it and
l thought about it.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.100
- Then l figured it out.
- No, you didn't.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.200
- Yes, l did.
- No.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.300
- You couldn't have.
- Admit it, Virgil.

48:29.400 --> 48:32.100
You, Charlie and Zeke...

48:32.800 --> 48:35.100
- ...are psychic.
- Time travelers?

48:35.100 --> 48:36.800
What? Who said ''time travelers''?

48:36.900 --> 48:39.100
- No, that's crazy. We're psychic.
- Get out!

48:39.200 --> 48:41.700
- We're psychic. l heard you...
- No, no, no.

48:41.700 --> 48:45.700
Virgil, you said time travel. Oh my
gosh, cool! How do you do it? Huh? Huh?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.100
Huh? Huh?

48:47.900 --> 48:50.200
[shouting]

48:52.300 --> 48:54.300
- Down!
- [girls cheer]

48:54.400 --> 48:57.400
[Derek calls play]

49:01.800 --> 49:03.000
- [whistle]
- Time out!

49:03.100 --> 49:06.100
[man on PA] Six seconds left
in this match of crosstown rivals.

49:06.200 --> 49:10.200
The Hornets cling to a four-point lead
coming on fourth and goal for Summerton.

49:10.300 --> 49:13.000
[groans] Football. Remind me
why we're here again.

49:13.400 --> 49:16.300
'Cause some kid always
embarrasses himself at these things.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.100
Just keep your eyes open.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.800
You know, l'm actually very bright.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.200
Even though a lot of people
see me as sputty.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.400
- Sputty?
- A cross between spunky and nutty.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.500
Great.

49:28.700 --> 49:32.800
Listen, Beau, it's all in your hands,
but no pressure.

49:32.900 --> 49:36.600
All right? Forget that there's
six seconds left on the clock.

49:36.700 --> 49:40.400
Forget that you could put
Summerton High on the map.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.800
Forget my little boy
is up there in the stands,

49:42.900 --> 49:45.200
looking down on his father trying
to fulfill a lifelong dream

49:45.200 --> 49:48.900
of winning a state championship.
Forget about all that.

49:49.900 --> 49:51.600
What l want is you...

49:51.700 --> 49:55.000
...you, to, uh...

49:55.000 --> 49:58.700
- Be the ball?
- Be the ball.

49:58.700 --> 50:00.800
Be the ball! Go get 'em!

50:06.700 --> 50:09.000
Down! Blue, twenty-two!

50:09.100 --> 50:11.200
- [girls] Go Rams go!
- Blue, twenty-two!

50:11.900 --> 50:15.300
- Set! Hike!
- Whoo!

50:15.400 --> 50:19.600
Down with Tolkan! Done with Tolkan!

50:19.700 --> 50:22.100
- [crowd laughing]
- Down with Tolkan!

50:22.200 --> 50:24.900
For a guy with nudity issues,
he's come full circle.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.100
[announcer] Loses the ball!
There's a fumble on the play!

50:30.500 --> 50:33.000
And Hamilton's got it!

50:33.600 --> 50:35.700
- [groans]
- [boy shouts]

50:35.700 --> 50:39.100
The Hornets win!
What a heartbreaker for Summerton.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.300
l always knew you were gonna do
big things, Virg, but time travel?

50:52.300 --> 50:53.600
That's whacked out, man.

50:53.700 --> 50:57.400
One, two, three, four
Your team stinks. You'll never score!

50:57.500 --> 50:59.300
- Amy...
- Five six seven eight

50:59.300 --> 51:02.700
- You can't touch this. l'm too great.
- Amy, that's it. Upstairs!

51:02.700 --> 51:06.100
Stephanie, l didn't even see you.
lt's so weird that you're here.

51:06.100 --> 51:09.500
And oh my gosh, Derek Beaugard?

51:09.500 --> 51:12.200
You are like the best
football player ever...

51:12.300 --> 51:15.100
...except for that blown play yesterday.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.800
- Just go. Amy, go watch cartoons.
- No.

51:19.800 --> 51:22.200
l'm so, so sorry.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.500
l'm trying to talk my folks
into caging her when there's company.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.300
She's so cute.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.800
- [Derek clears throat]
- Oh. So, um...

51:30.900 --> 51:34.600
About the game yesterday, Virg.
That was a really big deal for Derek.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.000
He feels like he let
everybody in school down.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.200
- l would've won that game.
- Chester streaked across the field

51:40.200 --> 51:43.000
- and distracted him.
- What's gotten into all the dorks?

51:43.100 --> 51:45.800
lt's like they just don't know
their place anymore.

51:48.500 --> 51:53.400
So you guys want the Minutemen to stop
Chester from interfering with the game?

51:53.500 --> 51:57.300
Uh, no, man.
We want you guys to do it.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.100
Who are the... Minutemen?

51:59.200 --> 52:00.700
That's us.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.300
Never mind.

52:04.200 --> 52:07.700
- So, uh...
- l don't know.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.100
- Charlie's gonna be a tough sell.
- Come on, Virg.

52:11.200 --> 52:15.200
l know we never really talked about
what went down that day, freshman year.

52:15.300 --> 52:18.800
But the thing is, l tried to stop them.
lt was a raw deal, man.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.400
l wish you and l could get back
to how we used to be.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.600
Always chillin'.

52:24.300 --> 52:26.800
What do you say, man?

52:38.700 --> 52:40.600
[both] Scorch!

52:44.900 --> 52:47.900
l can't believe you want to help Derek
after what he did to you?

52:47.900 --> 52:51.200
- Did to us?
- lt didn't happen the way we think.

52:51.300 --> 52:54.800
- And besides, it's time to move on.
- l've been running some tests.

52:54.800 --> 52:58.200
We might be damaging the space-time
continuum with our time travel.

52:58.300 --> 53:03.200
That could have serious consequences
to our future or even the planet.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.700
What happened to Derek in that game
was our fault.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.700
- lndirectly.
- He's right, Kookaburra.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.000
Chester's a different person
after you rescued him in the locker.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.400
- Excellent point.
- [Charlie] ls it me,

53:13.500 --> 53:16.000
or have l totally lost control
of this project?

53:16.200 --> 53:17.900
Lost control, bro.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.500
Sorry l'm late.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.500
Activating grid.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.800
Ah, yes. We mustn't forget
the grappling hook.

53:38.900 --> 53:43.400
Everybody's gotta make fun of the hook.
You'll all be sorry.

53:47.300 --> 53:49.000
[distorted yell]

53:51.800 --> 53:54.200
[distorted] Whee!

53:56.200 --> 53:57.700
[distorted shout]

53:57.800 --> 54:00.200
l will never get tired of that.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.000
Yeah!

54:15.100 --> 54:16.200
Ha!

54:18.000 --> 54:20.700
[laughing]

54:21.600 --> 54:24.000
[shouting]

54:27.500 --> 54:29.600
[machine powers down]

54:30.600 --> 54:33.100
Hey, guys. You seen this?

54:38.700 --> 54:40.800
Can l get a little help, guys?

54:41.400 --> 54:42.800
Guys, a little help?

54:42.900 --> 54:44.800
[crowd cheering]

54:46.700 --> 54:49.500
[announcer] Beaugard loses the ball,
fumbles the play.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.300
Hamilton's got it!
And the Hornets win.

54:54.300 --> 54:59.000
So because you took this tape with you
when you jumped back in time...

54:59.100 --> 55:01.000
lt still exists.

55:01.100 --> 55:04.300
- Pretty clever, huh?
- This is crazy, man.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.800
You're the man!
l gotta tell the guys about this.

55:06.900 --> 55:08.400
- [both] No!
- You can't do that!

55:08.500 --> 55:10.900
This is too big.
This has got to stay between us.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.900
Yeah, yeah, no worries, brother.
But we gotta celebrate.

55:13.900 --> 55:16.900
Tomorrow we're partying at my
house and you gotta be there.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.600
Oh, l want to. l, l can't, though.
l'm hanging out with Charlie.

55:20.700 --> 55:24.500
The Weather Network is counting down
the top ten hailstorms of all time.

55:26.100 --> 55:30.000
l didn't realize how lame an evening
that was till l said it out loud.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.900
Oh! Thank you.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.200
Thanks.

55:44.300 --> 55:45.800
So, you having fun?

55:45.900 --> 55:49.100
Oh, yeah. l haven't been to a party
since l was ten.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.900
And l remember the pony threw up on me.

55:51.600 --> 55:54.600
- That was my birthday party.
- Oh.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.700
- [stammering]
- l'm kidding.

55:58.800 --> 56:01.000
Oh, good.

56:03.700 --> 56:06.800
So l guess you're going
to the dance Saturday?

56:06.900 --> 56:08.400
Yeah, l guess.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.700
You don't sound happy about it.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.400
l don't know.
Derek and l go to every party,

56:13.400 --> 56:15.700
every social gathering.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.200
lt's really a sickness
when you think about it.

56:18.300 --> 56:19.700
l don't know.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.500
Being popular seems like
a very satisfying way of life.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.800
l don't know about that.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.300
Sometimes l wonder
if l chose the right path.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.100
l mean, look at you. You don't
seem to mind that you're...

56:31.900 --> 56:33.600
...um...

56:34.300 --> 56:35.800
Captain of the dorks?

56:35.900 --> 56:38.100
l wasn't going to say it like that.

56:38.200 --> 56:42.600
But seriously, you guys look like you're
having so much more fun than everyone.

56:42.700 --> 56:45.700
Really? 'Cause from our side,

56:46.400 --> 56:48.300
it looks like you
are having all the fun.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.900
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.100
- Hey, Virg!
- Hey.

56:52.100 --> 56:54.100
lt is so good partying with you again.

56:54.200 --> 56:58.300
Thank those other guys for me, the big,
scary dude, and the little twerp.

56:58.400 --> 57:01.400
Oh! Dang it.
l forgot to cancel with Charlie.

57:01.500 --> 57:03.000
Hold on, let me call him.

57:03.100 --> 57:06.500
- [girl] Stephanie, come see this.
- He probably forgot all about it.

57:35.800 --> 57:38.700
Charlie, how many more times
do l have to apologize?

57:38.800 --> 57:41.000
Three hundred and twelve times
ought to do it.

57:41.100 --> 57:44.200
Charlie, listen,
l'm really, really sorry!

57:45.900 --> 57:47.700
Fine... l forgive you.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.600
Look, I'm just really frazzled.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.200
l'm worried about the time machine
and possible ripple effects.

57:52.300 --> 57:53.400
[phone beeps]

57:53.600 --> 57:56.200
Hang on, l've got another call.
l'll get rid of them.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.000
- [sighs]
- Hello?

57:58.100 --> 57:59.700
Hey, Virgil?

57:59.700 --> 58:01.800
Um... [sobs]

58:01.800 --> 58:04.000
- l can't believe l just...
- What's wrong?

58:04.000 --> 58:05.800
He, um... [sobs]

58:05.900 --> 58:08.600
- He, um...
- Don't go anywhere. l'll be there.

58:10.900 --> 58:12.400
[sighs]

58:14.800 --> 58:18.000
[Virgil] Steph. Steph.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.100
Stephanie?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.900
[Virgil grunts, pants]

58:25.800 --> 58:28.600
l haven't done this
since eighth grade.

58:32.400 --> 58:36.300
- That, that wasn't there before.
- You could have used the front door.

58:37.100 --> 58:39.300
Yeah, but what fun would that be?

58:43.200 --> 58:45.900
So tell me, what happened?

58:46.100 --> 58:49.700
So, Derek got out of practice early.

58:49.800 --> 58:54.200
And when l went over to his house,
l saw him kissing Jocelyn Lee.

58:54.200 --> 58:56.900
Oh, Steph.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.500
l knew it, too.

58:59.600 --> 59:01.400
l just didn't want to believe it.

59:01.500 --> 59:04.200
l feel so stupid.

59:06.800 --> 59:10.000
l know how much you like
pistachio nuts, but

59:10.100 --> 59:14.000
in the rush to get here, l accidentally
grabbed a bag of pasta shells.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.000
Do you have any marinara sauce?

59:18.200 --> 59:20.500
Huh? Well...

59:20.600 --> 59:22.100
No, l can go get some if you...

59:23.900 --> 59:26.400
- [laughs]
- You're joking.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.500
lt was really nice of you
to come over, Virg.

59:30.600 --> 59:32.400
You're an amazing friend.

59:32.500 --> 59:35.700
Yeah... friend.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
[phone rings]

59:40.200 --> 59:42.800
- Hello?
- [Derek] Babe, can we talk this out?

59:44.100 --> 59:46.100
lt's Derek.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.700
Listen, l'm going to talk to him.

59:51.900 --> 59:53.500
l have to end it once and for all.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.500
Good luck.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.600
[grunting]

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.600
- [crashing]
- [cat howls]

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.700
[Virgil] l'm OK!

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.000
These repeated irregularities
are maintaining half-lives

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.200
after their primary incidence.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.400
- lt's totally weirdsville.
- [grunts]

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.600
l mean, it's serious, sir. Um...

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:34.600
The fluctuations are emanating directly
from Summerton High School.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.100
l actually have a theory about that.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.200
lt's, well...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.200
Does the department have
any contacts at the FBl?

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.700
You know, you're kind of
scary and unapproachable.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.600
[chatter]

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700
Can we sit with you?

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.200
[beeping]

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.600
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.000
Great athlete, hugely popular.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.100
l mean, it's like people
expect me to play the field.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.100
- Cheat almost.
- What's your point?

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.700
But l didn't cheat.
Jocelyn made the first move.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.000
She kissed me
but l didn't kiss her back.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.700
That does not count as cheating.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.600
The thing is, and this is
where you come in,

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.600
l want you to go back in time and stop
Stephanie from busting me with Jocelyn.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.300
What?

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.100
- Why should l?
- Because l made a big mistake.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.200
A huge one. And it'll never
happen again, l swear.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:36.000
l don't know.
l mean, you really hurt her.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.700
l know. l know and l feel awful.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.300
But Steph and l have been
going out a long time now.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.100
She's everything a guy could ever want.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.800
l like that the three of us
have been hanging out again.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.500
Like the old days,
and it could still be like that, man.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.100
Come on, buddy.
What do you say?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.700
- l need to think about it.
- Yeah.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.600
Yeah, sure.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.400
[car approaching quickly]

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.700
Hey! What's going on? Hold up.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.400
- [man] Put on your seat belt.
- [tires squeal]

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.500
l'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.900
But l can give you
the names of the two...

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.200
l was gonna give them fake names.
l'd never rat you out.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.700
Yeah, right.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.300
- Mr. ''Keep Me On Hold All Night.''
- [man] Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.500
My name is Agent Rehnquist, of the
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.700
And l'm going to let you boys
in on a secret.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900
A national secret.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.400
ln 1 969, shortly after
the Apollo 1 1 moon landing,

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.800
the United States government
began funding

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.400
a number of new scientific projects.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.500
One of these projects was time travel.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.300
- What?
- Time travel?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.800
- That's something else.
- So science fiction-y.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.400
Hollywood baloney. That's...

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.600
The project turned up little results

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.800
and was eventually shut down.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.100
The files never again touched.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.000
That is until two months ago

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.900
when an industrious individual,
or individuals,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.500
broke into the NASA mainframe,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.700
using a computer which we traced
to Summerton High School.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.000
[exhales] All right! l...

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.500
What my friend was about to say is that

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.300
if you're not going to
charge us with anything,

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.900
you can't keep us here.
That's right, look it up.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.500
l took a semester of Government.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.900
Got a B minus.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.100
l don't understand, sir.
You're just letting them go?

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.300
We can get more information
by watching.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.800
Yeah, but now they know
we're watching them.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.200
Yes sir, excellent plan.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.300
This is bad. Real bad.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.300
Yeah, way to go Naughty Ned.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.500
Thanks to you
we have the FBl on our backs.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.300
Me? l wanted to stop
this whole thing weeks ago!

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.300
But no, you had to use it
for your own personal gain.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.500
Charlie's right. Going to parties,
hanging with the populars.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.400
lf l remember correctly,
you benefited too.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.800
- How so?
- We gave you a life.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.600
Before us, you were this big guy
everyone was afraid of.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.300
- You better shut up, Virgil.
- See.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.600
You're being mean.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.100
Charlie, why don't you just go home
to your computer and your cat.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.800
l will.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.400
Good luck on your new life
as a popular person.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.800
l'm outta here, too. l'm better off
on my own, l always have been.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.700
Well, that's the last of the data.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.500
Unfortunately, we won't have an answer
until morning.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.000
[Albert meows]

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.100
Well, excuse me for not
having a supercomputer.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.000
[phone rings]

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.700
Hello?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.100
Oh. Hey, Derek.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.300
What do you say, Virg?
Gonna help me out, buddy?

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah, sure...

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.400
...D-rock.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.100
[bed squeaking]

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.700
- Ahh!
- Good morning, Magpie!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Your mom let me in.
lt is such a nice day l was thinking

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.300
we could go on a walk
and talk about our future.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.300
And then... oh!

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400
- l'd like an orange house.
- The results!

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.400
You wouldn't need an address.
On the envelope you just say

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.700
''Jeanette Pachelewski, orange house.''

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.900
lt's done!

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.300
[keyboard]

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.200
Oh, um, l'm no scientist,

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.900
but that doesn't look good.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.200
We created a... a...

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.300
A... a...
Spit it out, Bluebird.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.900
A black hole.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.500
That's bad, right?

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.800
As the timeline continues,

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:38.300
we see an increased number of
occurrences here in the Summerton area.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.600
lf we can all turn to page 47,
we can see where l highlighted...

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.600
- [man] Hey!
- l lied!

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.500
l stole the formula, we've been
time-traveling all over the place.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.300
Way ahead of you.
l'd like you to meet Doctors Connors

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.500
and Winthorpe from the seismology
department at Pacific Tech.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.800
Doctors, this is Charles Tuttle.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.500
- What are you, nine years old?
- He's fourteen.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.900
That's better. Now l don't feel
like such a loser.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.500
So you already know
about the black hole?

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.400
- What?
- The black hole!

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.800
l knew you guys were underfunded,
but come on.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.900
Preposterous. We ran the worst case
scenario several times.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.800
We never came up
with a black hole.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.300
l see five, six decimals
that weren't carried over.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.700
Hmm.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.200
- Oops.
- Yeah, oops.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.800
Each time we used the machine,
the rift in the space-time continuum

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.300
did not disappear. lnstead the
fluctuations blended together

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.500
to create one giant black hole.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.500
The worst part is the black hole will
spread until it swallows up Summerton.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.100
Then the Northwest,
then the entire United States.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.100
- [gulps]
- And so on.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.100
- How much time till zero hour?
- According to my estimates we have...

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.400
...less than four hours
till the end of the world.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.900
OK, people, we are going to Code Red.
Get Washington on the phone, now!

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.800
There might be a way to reverse it,
but it's a longshot.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.500
Well, let's hear it, sir.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.800
[chatter]

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.300
[Stephanie] l'm excited
for the dance tonight.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.300
And you know what?

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.899
l'm really glad
you're coming with me.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.200
- Hey, what are friends for?
- [laughs] Come on.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.200
[rock music]

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.899
- Everything set?
- Uh, yeah.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.200
The suits are in the basement, we'll go
through the tunnels under the cafeteria.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.000
Sweet. We'll go as soon as they
announce the winners.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.700
Hey, Virgil.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.100
Steph...

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:30.200
Do you believe that a person's life
can change in a single moment?

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.200
Sometimes for the better,
other times for the worse?

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.200
Yeah, l guess.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.700
There's a moment in one of our
lives that's about to change.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.100
And l don't know if it's
for the better or for the worse.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.200
Virgil, um, l'm not following.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.300
[music ends]

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.500
- Uh, attention...
- [feedback]

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.800
Um, attention everyone.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.100
lt's time to announce this year's
king and queen of the dance.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.600
But first...

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.200
[imitates Elvis] Sonny, Red,
and l wanna fry up some

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.800
peanut butter and banana sandwiches.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.800
lt's Elvis Presley. Anyone?

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.400
Come on, that was a brilliant...
Whatever.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.500
[groans] Stephanie Jameson and
Virgil Fox get up here. You won.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.300
- This is such a surprise.
- Not really.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.700
To guarantee we'd win, l went back
in time and stuffed the ballot box.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.800
What?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.400
Miss Jameson and Mr. Fox.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.200
Don't let it go to your head.
There's still time for a recount.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.000
[slow song plays]

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.700
So, um, did you really stuff the box?

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.100
Yeah.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.600
l mean, you, sure,
but who would vote for me?

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.100
l would.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.000
- This is weird.
- Yeah.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.500
- Why?
- A good weird.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.700
- Right.
- How you can be friends with someone

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.600
for so long, then...

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.900
- lt's different..
- A good different.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.700
- Come on, brother, it's time to go.
- Oh, about that.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.900
- l think l changed my mind.
- You promised.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.200
- Virgil?
- Don't go anywhere. l'll be right back.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.300
l knew Derek would be hacked
about Virgil bringing Stephanie.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.300
Fight!

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400
- Oh, no.
- [kids chanting] Fight, fight.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.800
Derek, wait up.
Can we talk about this?

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.700
[commotion]

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.600
Oh, man.

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.200
Stephanie, where's Virgil?

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.000
- He left with Derek.
- Why?

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.500
Don't tell me he's going
to jump back in time?

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.600
- Oh my gosh, that's what he's doing!
- He might make things worse!

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.400
- [Charlie] Excuse me! Sorry!
- Worse than the end of the world?

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.100
Derek, l don't think l can do this.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
What, why?

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.500
Stephanie. l just...
l just think...

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.600
Dude, don't tell me
you're going to try to steal my girl.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.400
We're friends. l mean,
buddies don't do that to each other.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.200
[Charlie] Virgil! Virgil Fox!

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.100
Virgil, we have a small problem.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.100
[whispers] We have less than an hour
to save the planet!

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.500
- What are you talking about?
- Well, well. What do we have here, hmm?

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.500
Looks like the beginnings of a fracas.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.700
- A what?
- A fracas!

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.500
- lt's a fight.
- We'll sort out the detentions later.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.100
Right now, all of you
get back to the gym.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.700
- [all groan]
- Everyone move!

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.300
Everyone freeze! FBl!

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.700
Stop! ClA!

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.400
Bureau of Weights and Measures!

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.900
ln the future,
you should probably go first.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.100
[rumbling]

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.100
Virgil, that's what l
was talking about. Come on.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.200
[rumbling continues]

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.600
[people shouting]

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.200
We need to get these people
out of here now!

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.100
- [excited chatter]
- [zapping]

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.200
[Virgil] So, we're supposed to go
inside the black hole and close it?

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.300
As far as l can figure,
it's the only way.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.900
We'll take the remote pack with us
and reverse the polarity once we land.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.600
- What pack?
- l've been working on

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.000
a new way to control
our jumps from the other side.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.300
OK, hold the phone.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.100
We can't let these students go in that,
they could die!

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.800
We have no choice. They're the only
ones familiar with the equipment.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.400
lf they don't go
then we could all die.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:53.800
God speed.

01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.200
l'm the one who messed everything up.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.600
l'll go. Charlie and Zeke
had nothing to do with it.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.800
What do you mean, nothing to do
with it? l invented it.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.600
- l helped.
- No, you didn't.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.300
- Yeah, l did.
- You painted it!

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.200
- [both arguing]
- [man] Excuse me.

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.800
OK. Enough! Enough!

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.300
You'll both go.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.700
You'll be needing me too, sir,
and my hook.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.300
[grunts]

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.900
[chatter]

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.300
[delighted screams]

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.300
Listen, guys, once we've reversed
the wormhole's polarity,

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.800
there's no measuring
how quickly it will close.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:11.400
lt could stay open for several more
minutes or vanish instantaneously.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.400
And even if we do
make it back alive,

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.700
there's no guarantee we'll return
exactly to the point we exited from.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.000
- Aye aye, Señor Positive.
- Good luck, Zeke!

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.200
[moans]

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.900
Virgil, l hear you're
trying to save the world.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.900
That's right. Your big brother's
pretty cool, huh?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.100
When you die can l have your room?
Mine is way too small and...

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.300
- Bye, Amy.
- [Jeanette] Charlie, um...

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.800
Come back in one piece, OK?

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.300
Come on, Charlie, we gotta go.
Charlie?

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.400
[both] Charlie?

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.200
- [Zeke] Here.
- All right, Zeke.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.400
[cheering]

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.900
Virgil.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.400
[girl] You can do it!

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.900
Listen, l just... whatever happens,
l just want you to know...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.900
Hey man, good luck.
With everything.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.900
Yeah, great.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.800
Just, um...

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.300
Just be careful.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.600
- OK?
- OK.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:34.700
[crowd chanting] Minutemen!
Minutemen! Minutemen!

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.200
At least they finally
got the name right.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.600
[chanting continues]

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.200
Let's do this, fellas!

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.900
[all three shouting]

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.000
[all yelling]

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.600
[children laughing]

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.500
Whoa. Cool.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.100
[all yelling]

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.100
- [groans]
- [Charlie coughing]

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.800
[children shouting]

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:54.800
Wow! Space men!

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:59.300
- l think we landed in Munchkinland.
- Cool. What up, Munchkins?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.500
Actually, we're across town
at the park.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.200
What planet did you come from?
From Neptune?

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.400
Do people on Neptune eat macaroni? l
love macaroni. ls macaroni a vegetable?

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.800
Beat it, kid. We're workin' here.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.900
OK, set up the antenna.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.500
Beginning reversal sequence.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.200
[Virgil] Come on.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.600
Wow! Sweet!

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600
This looks good!

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.400
Rate of increase is slowing!

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.600
The vortex's polarity is decreasing.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.200
Stabilization achieved!

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.800
- l think we did it!
- Ha!

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.200
We have 20 minutes
till the vortex touches the ground.

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.000
Then we can jump back.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.000
Hey, guys.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.500
- Today is September 3rd, 2005.
- First day of school freshman year.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.900
- Oh, that's the day...
- ''The lncident.''

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.500
- ''The lncident.''
- [Charlie] Of course!

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.700
The day a module of quantum acceleration

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:11.400
first interacted with the space-time
continuum! The rocket cart.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.300
lt's linked the wormhole from our
present to this moment in the past.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.900
- [Charlie] ln a few moments our...
- Dude.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.000
[Zeke] Don't do it, Virgil.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.300
Virg, no!

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.500
Virg, come on!

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.200
You're thinking of stopping
what's going on there?

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.600
Why not? lsn't that what
the Minutemen do? Un-do mistakes?

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.200
Well, l made a mistake down there.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.000
l have a chance to be somebody.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.400
OK, but know this.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.300
What happened down there is
we became friends.

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.000
That day that we were tied up together
on that stupid Ram statue.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.500
[girls screaming]

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.200
This day.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:09.900
This day you hate so much because
you got a little embarrassed?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.300
This is my favorite day.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.700
Even though l'd still be a nerd,
it didn't really matter anymore,

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.900
because now l had a real friend.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.600
And that would always
make everything OK.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.300
So much for always, l guess.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.100
[chatter]

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.400
Listen... listen, Virg,

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.900
you do what you gotta do here.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.700
And if things aren't the same
on the other side...

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.100
...it's been a good ride.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.500
[shouting]

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.500
[Derek] Hey guys, wait!
You shouldn't do that.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.100
'Cause l've got a much better idea.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.300
l mean, why don't we
smear this all over them?

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.000
- [all cheer]
- [Derek] Losers.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.400
[beeping]

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.400
No! No! The closure rate of the vortex
went into overdrive!

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.100
- You're telling me...
- lf that touches the ground,

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.000
we'll be trapped here for good.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.300
- What about Virgil?
- There's no way we'll make it to him

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.200
and back to the vortex in time!

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.100
- [grunts]
- Charlie! Charlie, get up!

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.400
Get up, Charlie!
We gotta keep moving!

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.300
Let's go!

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.500
We're never going to make it.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.600
We're a mile away.
We're stuck in the past forever.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.800
[car approaching]

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Man, you do not want
to go back there.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.200
Kids getting roughed up
by football players. lt's real ugly.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.500
You don't say?

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.100
At first, l felt kinda sorry
for the dorky kid, but...

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.400
...then l realized,
what does he need me for?

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.100
He's got himself
a great friend down there.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.300
And someday he'll have
other great friends, too.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.900
[both] Scorch!

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:33.300
You know, let's come up
with our own handshake.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.600
Can we go? l don't feel like repeating
three years of high school.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.400
- Right. Sorry.
- Good idea! Go, go!

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.000
Seatbelts!

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.400
- [horn honks]
- Look out!

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.000
[all yelling]

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.400
[still yelling]

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.200
- Car!
- Ahh!

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.600
- [horns honking]
- [boys screaming]

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.100
- Oh my God!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.700
- What are you doing?!
- What do you mean?

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.300
That was 1 4th Street!
The vortex is back that way.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.800
Oh, my bad.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.400
- We're never gonna make it!
- No problem.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.700
[boys screaming]

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.700
- [honks horn]
- [boys scream]

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.300
- [tires screech]
- [still screaming]

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.100
- Whoa!
- [both] Yeah, grappling hook!

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.700
- Oh my God!
- Yeah!

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.300
Now keep your hand on the wheel!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.600
- Go, Virgil!
- Go or we're not gonna make it!

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.300
We're not gonna make it!

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.100
We're not gonna make it!

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.600
Minutemen rule!

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.900
[all scream]

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.700
[all yelling]

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.000
[all grunting]

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.700
Where's my rocket cart?

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.400
[Virgil] What day is it?

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.700
That is it.
No more time travel!

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.800
OK, up. You're supposed to be jogging.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.900
Now, nobody loafs in my gym class.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.300
- You don't understand!
- l understand plenty!

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.400
l understand you're not jogging.
So let's move it! Let's go!

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.700
[blows whistle] Go! Go! Go!

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.300
Start jogging!
Move it, move it, move it!

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.700
l got to get one
of those cool jogging suits.

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.200
A smoking tire?

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.200
All right, people, no loitering
in the hallways. Let's move it along.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.700
Go!

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.700
[quietly] l'm definitely gonna
institute a dress code in this place!

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.500
[Derek] See, Steph, l need her help.
l have no idea what you just said.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.300
l said, ''My boyfriend
is a lying cheesebrain.''

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.300
- Come on, Steph.
- Derek, l'm trying to study.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.300
You know what?
This is the first day we time traveled.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.200
The day we tried to win the lottery.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.000
Wow, nice outfits, bozos.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.900
Hey, Derek.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.200
Have fun with Jocelyn.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.900
What's that supposed to mean?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.300
Oh, l don't know. l figured
you're both so good with lipstick,

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.100
you'd make a perfect match.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.400
You were always gonna be
a dork anyway, Virgil.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.700
And you were always gonna be
a jerk, Derek.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.300
Have a nice life.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.600
- Ladies.
- Oh, what's new, Cockatoo?

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.500
- Wow, you look like a superhero.
- Thanks, pumpkin.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.000
Mmm?

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:58.400
You've never kissed her. The scene in
the hallway hasn't happened yet.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:02.700
Oh, right. Jeanette, l'm sorry!

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.900
l was just... l can explain.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
[laughs] Hey, it's OK.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.600
- Uh, Steph.
- Oh, hey.

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.900
You didn't see me
in here before, did you?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.100
No, and um...
what's with the weird suit?

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.500
Oh, l was just rehearsing
a little school play

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.700
about time travel and, uh,
it kinda got me thinking.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.500
lf l really could go back in time,
what would l change?

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.500
That snowsuit?

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.400
l would tell Stephanie how l really
feel about her.

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.600
That l think she's great.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.900
And if l could go back in time...

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.300
...l think l'd tell Virgil
the same thing.

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.000
[bell rings]

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.200
- Virgil!
- What?

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.400
[Zeke] Charlie!

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.800
What does the word
''teleportation'' mean to you?

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.400
lt's bigger than time travel,
a whole new transportation paradigm.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.400
We still have the slide projector...
[muffled]

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.600
- l'll call you.
- [Charlie still muffled]

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.700
- lt's like time travel.
- No, Charlie.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.200
- Black hole!
- Follow me.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.800
Stephanie, listen to me! Talk to him,
he likes you! You'll like him!

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.400
Think about gas prices.
Think about global warming.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.200
l could get Jeanette back!

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.200
OK, we're here.
Where's the fire?

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.900
Ah, gentlemen, brace yourselves,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
for this is going to be
the greatest invention...

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:45.100
ln the history of all mankind.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.700
Whoa. l knew the shrimp tacos
were a bad idea.

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.300
You made another...
He made another Charlie.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.400
Yeah. l got that.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.000
[both] How great is this?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.400
- l'm not sure ''great'' is the word.
- ''Terrible''?

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.300
- Yeah. That's it.
- Think of the possibilities.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.400
The practical applications?
You have a violin lesson,

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.400
but you also want
to catch Judge Judy.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.000
No problemo.
Here's the solution.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
- Or you could just record it.
- Mmm.

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.600
Bad example. l'm taking AP history
and AP physics the same semester,

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.400
but for some reason
l'm on academic overload,

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.600
and don't have time
to study for both finals...

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.600
- [Charlie #1] Guys.
- [Charlie #2] What are you doing?

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.700
- [Charlie #1] Zeke, Virgil.
- [Charlie #2] That's my arm.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.200
Where are you going?
You can't leave us in here.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.200
At least you'll have company.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.900
What about the team?
Minutemen ride again!

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.300
- l like that. What about the team?
- That kid really loves science.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.500
Yeah.

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.300
Hey, scooch over.
l'm going for the pretzel nubs.

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:05.100
So, we're supposed to go inside
the black hole and close it?

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:08.100
As far as l can figure,
it's the only way.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.700
[dance music plays]
