WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.117
(Nathan): Previously on Haven...

00:02.253 --> 00:04.665
- Without a Colton,
we cannot get into the Void.

00:04.797 --> 00:07.584
- Duke, I'm Hailie Colton.
- Hailie.

00:08.968 --> 00:09.923
- I did it!

00:10.970 --> 00:11.925
(Nathan): It's about time.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.590
(groans)
(Vince): Dave, stop!

00:14.515 --> 00:16.471
(Dwight): Croatoan knew exactly
what we were doing.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.808
(Vince): It's like he can see the world
through Dave.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.848
We hypnotize Dave,
get him to go into his own mind,

00:21.981 --> 00:24.188
cast out Croatoan,
and destroy him.

00:24.317 --> 00:28.026
- The last piece of the puzzle's in the Void.
Hailie's phasing Trouble can get me in.

00:28.154 --> 00:30.861
- When I was outside the Shroud,
I had a vision,

00:30.990 --> 00:32.571
and Haven was hell on earth,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.783
and it was all because you went into the Void
and didn't come back.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.277
- So make sure I come back.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.619
(grunts)

00:39.749 --> 00:42.456
- You got to be kidding me.
- William.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.247
Mara sent me. We need something
from the old Barn.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.539
A controller.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.378
(Audrey): Hailie, you have to keep it open.

00:48.507 --> 00:54.093
- I will not give up my power.
(Audrey): Hailie, stop! Nathan!

00:55.139 --> 00:56.299
- No!

00:56.432 --> 00:58.263
(grunts)

00:59.936 --> 01:02.894
(grunting)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.559
(coughing)

01:18.079 --> 01:21.287
- Oh.
I saw that.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.451
Not good news, Nate.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.996
Humans don't do well in the Void.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.831
You're lightheaded.
You're getting weaker.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.705
Means you don't have much time left.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.173
You know, if you freed me,

01:33.302 --> 01:35.088
then I could help you move that thing.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.796
Think about it, Detective.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.174
You need me.
- No, I don't.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.094
- You really think
you can just leave me here?

01:45.231 --> 01:47.643
Mara's gonna get control of her body,
and when she does,

01:47.775 --> 01:51.188
she's gonna slaughter you
and everything you love.

01:52.780 --> 01:57.365
- She is not coming back.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.067
- Truce.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.902
Okay?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.654
We can settle all this later
and then go back to trying

02:03.791 --> 02:07.454
to kill each other, but right now,
first, we have to get back to Haven.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.962
It's what we want.

02:09.088 --> 02:13.081
It's what Mara and Audrey want,
but we have to do it together.

02:13.426 --> 02:15.041
- The answer is still no.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.257
Now, shut up.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.924
- You're such a fool!

02:19.557 --> 02:22.299
How Mara didn't kill you on sight,
I have no idea,

02:22.435 --> 02:24.847
and she's still gonna get
out of Audrey's body,

02:24.979 --> 02:28.142
because she'll rip the flesh off her bones--
- Enough!

02:29.442 --> 02:32.149
You don't get it, do you?

02:32.278 --> 02:34.314
It is just Audrey now.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.526
Mara is not coming back.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.321
Mara's dead.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.542
- Hailie! Hailie!

02:49.670 --> 02:52.958
- Where did she go?
- I don't know. She can walk through walls.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.921
- She can't make another thinny
without my ring,

02:55.051 --> 02:59.420
so we know she didn't go hide in the Void.
- And we know she's done helping us.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.295
- Why does she think her Trouble's
worth keeping?

03:01.432 --> 03:03.093
It's gotta have a downside, right?

03:03.225 --> 03:06.308
- There is.
It's dangerous as hell to use.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.723
You heard her.
She thinks it's all she's got.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.563
- Yeah, well, Hailie is all we've got.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.069
She's our only way
to get Nathan out of the Void.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.026
(Hailie screams)

03:22.078 --> 03:23.659
(both gasp)

03:24.080 --> 03:25.570
(Audrey): Oh, my God.
- Help me!

03:25.706 --> 03:28.664
(cries in pain)

03:28.793 --> 03:30.283
(Duke): Hailie.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.921
(theme music)

04:06.664 --> 04:09.451
(Dwight): Do you really think this can work?
- I don't know.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.201
The last time I tried to hypnotize him,
our memories were completely wiped.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.829
- There has to be a way
for Dave to separate himself from Croatoan.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.629
- Or, more than that,
find a way to kill Croatoan once and for all.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.629
- Dave's gonna try to kill him?
- Excuse me. I can hear you.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.098
- If we do this, we need to do it fast
before Croatoan finds a way to stop us.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.512
- All right.

04:30.646 --> 04:35.356
We need to create a space in your mind
where you can confront him.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.145
- What kind of space?

04:37.278 --> 04:41.647
- Well, um, we'll call it,
uh, a mind palace.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.319
A familiar place
where you can feel safe.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.239
An environment
that represents who you are.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.159
- Once l've hypnotized you,
if Croatoan is truly

04:51.292 --> 04:54.705
a part of your mind now,
we should find him there.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.044
- And then what am I supposed to do?

04:58.174 --> 05:00.790
- Find out if he has any weaknesses,
what his plans are for Haven.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.134
- Oh, is that all?
- This is serious, Dave.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.629
It could be
our last chance to save you.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.096
- Fine. Fine.

05:09.685 --> 05:13.769
But if Croatoan is gonna be waiting for me
in my mind palace,

05:14.315 --> 05:17.853
then I'm gonna want a machine gun
when | get there. Two of them.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.692
- You have no control
of what you bring with you

05:20.821 --> 05:22.357
or what you'll find there.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.152
- You find a way to kill him, do it.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.111
- All right, then.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.706
Let's get this over with.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.877
- Opening that portal wore me out.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.830
l rematerialized too soon.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.383
How are you gonna get me
out of here, hmm?

05:46.222 --> 05:47.428
What?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.552
The bars didn't go through
my heart or my lungs, right?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.299
Or else I'd be dead.
- Hailie...

05:53.604 --> 05:56.596
these rods that are
running through you,

05:56.732 --> 05:59.599
they're what's keeping you
from bleeding out.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.646
- What?
- They're what's keeping you alive.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.610
- No, no, no.
You're wrong. No.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.604
- I'm sorry, Hailie,
but she's not wrong.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.447
If we cut you out...

06:08.536 --> 06:10.527
If we try to move you
even a few inches...

06:10.663 --> 06:13.154
- No.
You're just saying that.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.953
You're mad at me, you're trying to trick me,
and it's not gonna work.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.326
It's not gonna work, okay?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.498
- Now we need you to stay calm.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.498
(breathing heavily)

06:23.634 --> 06:25.124
(Audrey): Duke...

06:29.431 --> 06:31.638
- I want you to stay calm.
I'll be right back.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.268
- Where are you going?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.390
- What are we gonna do?

06:40.401 --> 06:41.857
- She's going to die.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.022
There's nothing we can do
to stop that.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.362
But if she could just keep
the thinny open long enough

06:47.491 --> 06:48.992
for Nathan to come back...

06:49.493 --> 06:51.324
(sighs)
- Let me talk to her.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.002
- Now, I've hypnotized you before,
so this shouldn't take much.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.294
Visualize your mind palace.

07:05.426 --> 07:09.760
A place where you feel
powerful and safe.

07:10.848 --> 07:14.261
In your fight with Croatoan,

07:14.393 --> 07:17.305
visualize your battlefield.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.100
Where do you want it to be?

07:20.232 --> 07:23.315
Where is your strength?

07:49.345 --> 07:52.052
- Some mind palace this is.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.262
Hello?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.306
Croatoan?

07:58.187 --> 08:01.554
- He just went out.
So, did it work, Maddie?

08:03.484 --> 08:04.894
- Maddie!

08:06.528 --> 08:08.610
What happened?
- Her eyes.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.695
She must've been Troubled.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.689
Croatoan did this.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.782
- How?
VVhen?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.870
We were right here
and Dave is still chained up...

08:17.998 --> 08:19.454
- What the hell?

08:21.585 --> 08:23.746
- He didn't have time
to free himself and kill her.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.416
She just put him
under a minute ago.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.666
- That was 10 minutes ago.
We were here the whole time

08:30.803 --> 08:32.885
while he murdered her.
We just don't remember it.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.753
We lost time...

08:43.899 --> 08:45.105
- You know what?

08:45.234 --> 08:46.599
I think you're full of it.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.441
She's not dead.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.319
She can't be.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.157
Audrey can't be alive without Mara.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.695
You don't have another Barn.

08:56.829 --> 08:59.741
T-there's nothing
you could do that with.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.659
- Oh, we didn't do it.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.838
Her mother did.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.623
Charlotte.

09:11.635 --> 09:15.344
After you brought Mara out,
she was on a rampage.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.760
We used a Trouble
to split her and Audrey apart.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.974
- Troubles that can affect us?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.479
It's what she always wanted.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.145
She finally got it.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.651
- Then Charlotte came back.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.487
She had to make a choice.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.818
Choose Mara or Audrey.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.370
She chose Audrey.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.549
Here goes.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.840
(efforts)

10:05.272 --> 10:07.103
(throwing effort)

10:09.276 --> 10:11.483
(coughing)

10:12.613 --> 10:14.274
- You're getting weaker.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.864
You're gonna die here.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.444
We both are.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.749
(drips)

10:47.064 --> 10:48.975
- Why doesn't it hurt more?

10:49.358 --> 10:51.565
- Because you're in shock.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.399
Your body is shutting down.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.019
- I finally...

10:55.739 --> 10:57.400
had one good thing.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.236
I could do anything.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.067
And now...

11:03.831 --> 11:06.163
I don't want to die, Duke.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.250
- Hailie.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.413
You can still make it count
for something.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.091
Use your Trouble one last time.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.925
Help us open up that thinny
and save Nathan.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.423
Help me.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.927
- Help you?

11:29.565 --> 11:32.682
You're the one who turned my Trouble on,
and then you tried to kill me

11:32.818 --> 11:36.231
and that was before you...
you got me into all of this mess!

11:36.697 --> 11:39.530
I am dying because of you.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.862
- Hailie, I brought you here

11:46.206 --> 11:48.618
because you can save Haven.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.122
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but this is my destiny.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.300
Our destiny.
- I don't care about your destiny.

11:57.801 --> 12:01.760
I am going to die here,
and it's because of you,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.845
so you can shove your destiny
up your ass.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.009
- Hailie...
- No.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.384
I'm not helping you
open a thinny or anything else.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.641
I would rather die.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.403
- No Croatoan there.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.417
Hello, you beauty.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.581
Maybe it's just me in here...

12:54.358 --> 12:55.518
Yep.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.186
All me.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.271
(slam)

13:04.993 --> 13:08.076
No.No.No.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.406
(ticking)

13:14.002 --> 13:16.288
What in the blazes?
(typing)

13:29.351 --> 13:30.386
Who's there?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.265
- Vince, we can't take that chance!

13:43.865 --> 13:45.025
l was about to hit you.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.410
- Why?
We were arguing.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.068
About what?

13:50.706 --> 13:51.616
- Son of a bitch.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.864
We lost time.
Again.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.332
- This is a disaster.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.417
- Where the hell
did that come from?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.832
- I don't know.
Maybe we were defending ourselves?

13:59.965 --> 14:02.581
- Defend yourself with that,
next you'll be moving my body.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.006
- Croatoan's doing something to us.
But why?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.928
- Because Dave found something out.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.767
Something Croatoan
doesn't want us to know.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.511
Why else would he be
erasing our memories?

14:16.648 --> 14:20.140
- But the gun. ls Croatoan trying
to get us to kill Dave?

14:24.239 --> 14:26.400
(breathing)

14:38.253 --> 14:39.789
- What do you know that I don't?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.837
- Oh, just about everything, really.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.810
- Is that what I think it is?

14:57.147 --> 14:58.933
- Aether.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.103
It's the element of the Void
in its purest form.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.987
Mara and | used to come
to places like this to collect it.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.948
- So, why haven't you
summoned it to you?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.910
- Oddly, l have to get a little
on my hands first.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.824
Then I can do something with it.

15:15.165 --> 15:19.499
- Oh, then I guess you're out of luck.
- Nope, 'cause you're gonna get it for me.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.038
- Why would I ever do that?

15:21.171 --> 15:24.789
- 'Cause I know how you and l
are gonna move that boulder.

15:24.925 --> 15:29.589
I'm gonna use the aether
to give you a new Trouble.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.007
- Forget it.
- Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.554
But here's the thing...

15:34.351 --> 15:37.718
It's the only way that you and l
are getting out of here.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.808
Either I give you a new Trouble,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.731
or we both die.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.159
- So, Hailie is dying
and she still won't help us?

15:56.706 --> 16:00.073
- I can't say I blame her.
But I will get her there. I know it.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.871
- Duke, we are running out of time.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.211
Nathan is running out of time.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.090
You're gonna make me say it,
aren't you?

16:09.219 --> 16:10.550
- Say what?

16:10.887 --> 16:13.139
- That there is another way
that this ends.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.384
I hate it, too.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.554
But if Hailie's dying anyway...

16:24.985 --> 16:28.523
If you kill Hailie
and use the Crocker curse

16:28.655 --> 16:31.442
to take her Trouble,
then you could open a thinny.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.233
- We have been down this road before,
you and me.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.823
I mean, this kind of nightmare
is why I left in the first place.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.495
- Duke...

16:42.627 --> 16:47.712
If it is your destiny to save Haven,
then what if this is how you do it?

16:47.841 --> 16:48.956
- No.

16:50.594 --> 16:55.588
I found out the Crocker family curse
was created by Croatoan.

16:56.766 --> 17:01.135
You see? Using it is exactly
what he would want us to do.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.512
- What if we don't have
any other choice?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.984
- That girl is gonna die on her own.

17:10.113 --> 17:14.197
Before she does,
I will get her to help us.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.992
That is my choice.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.831
- So I slap a little more
aether into your body.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.340
What's the problem?
- What's the problem?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.832
Who knows what you'd do to me
with that stuff?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.504
- Fine.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.002
Answer me this...

17:35.138 --> 17:39.177
How far are you willing
to go for Audrey?

17:39.309 --> 17:42.016
'Cause I would do anything for Mara.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.558
And... and she would do anything for me.
- You're wrong.

17:47.859 --> 17:51.977
Mara wanted to get you back, but only
so she could find your stash of aether.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.568
You knew where it was.
She didn't.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.406
That's all you were to her.

17:58.536 --> 18:02.404
(coughing)
- Ah, trouble breathing, huh?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.247
Yeah? Not feeling so good?
You're dying.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.208
Giving you a new Trouble is the only way

18:07.337 --> 18:09.828
that either one of us is getting
out of this hellhole alive.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.960
- Croatoan?
(ticking)

18:16.096 --> 18:17.757
What?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.174
(typing)

18:22.227 --> 18:25.264
(Croatoan): I wouldn’t do that
if I were you, Dave.

18:25.397 --> 18:29.857
What you do here will affect
your body in the real world.

18:32.529 --> 18:33.735
- Croatoan...

18:33.863 --> 18:35.945
- You came here to kill me, Dave.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.486
But you’re the one who’s in danger.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.406
I know everything you know.
So tell me...

18:42.539 --> 18:46.532
Why shouldn’t I kill you
right here, right now?

18:47.127 --> 18:48.833
- You owe me.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.954
An explanation, at least.
Why?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.500
Why me?

18:53.633 --> 18:57.091
- You’re a half/ing.
The only viable host.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.677
I couldn’t leave the Void on my own.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.467
I needed you.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.135
- All this time...

19:04.060 --> 19:05.925
I thought I was drawn to thinnies,

19:06.062 --> 19:08.519
but it was you pulling me there.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.513
- I couldn’t hold on the ﬁrst time,

19:10.650 --> 19:14.268
but when you opened the door
in that cave, l was ready.

19:14.404 --> 19:18.693
I got a foothold in you
when I cut your leg.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.199
- You ruined my life!

19:23.121 --> 19:26.238
You used me to kill people!

19:28.084 --> 19:30.120
So many people.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.993
- A side effect.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.667
I’ve been absorbing Troubles.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.461
Growing strong enough.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.550
- Enough?

19:39.679 --> 19:40.794
For what?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.307
- To leave your body.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.925
l’ll pour out of you
and enter your world on my own.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.224
It will be very soon now.

19:50.357 --> 19:54.066
- But... you are in my body.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.607
This is my mind.
So I can still stop you.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.074
- No. You can ’t.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.612
But I appreciate you being my vessel.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.326
l’ll spare you, Dave,

20:05.455 --> 20:08.913
but only if you leave here.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.248
Now!

20:12.128 --> 20:14.710
- Right.
This is the only way.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.127
Go now.
Before I shoot you, too.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.006
- Not again.
- Oh, my God. Was I about to...

20:26.142 --> 20:27.678
kill my brother?

20:29.687 --> 20:32.975
How could I have possibly...

20:36.861 --> 20:38.237
(phone chiming)

20:42.158 --> 20:43.864
What?
What is it?

20:44.994 --> 20:46.200
- It's me.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.820
I left a message for myself
and itjust came through.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.617
(Dave): You have to shoot me, Vince.
It’s the safest thing to do.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.244
(Dwight): Vince, wait.
This doesn’t seem right.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.796
What if Croatoan
wants us to kill Dave?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.916
No, wait!
(message beeps)

21:02.178 --> 21:04.385
- You knew he'd take time
from us again.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.296
So you recorded it.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.173
- At least now we know
what's going on.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.801
Croatoan's trying to
get us to kill Dave.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.973
He erases our memory
every time we catch on.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.848
- But what is going on in there?
- I don't know.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.936
But eventually,
we're gonna kill him...

21:18.361 --> 21:19.350
or each other.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.529
(gurgles)

21:29.789 --> 21:30.778
Here we go.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.659
- Croatoan.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.998
We know it's you.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.367
- What?
No.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.619
It's me.
It's Dave.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.374
- How can we be sure?

21:39.507 --> 21:40.963
- Two words...

21:41.634 --> 21:44.091
Oprah Winfrey.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.795
- Yeah.
It's him, all right.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.889
Thank God you're back.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.594
While you were in there,
Croatoan's been taking over your body.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.345
He killed Maddie.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.939
And he's been making us
lose time over and over again.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.352
- Lose time?

21:59.486 --> 22:02.068
- We think he's trying
to get us to kill you.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.313
- But he told me
I didn't need to die.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.739
- What? You actually
talked to Croatoan?

22:06.868 --> 22:09.029
- Yeah.
- What else do you tell you?

22:10.121 --> 22:11.986
- Terrible things.

22:12.123 --> 22:16.958
He's gonna leave my body
any moment and be free.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.417
Here, in Haven.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.415
- Dave.

22:20.548 --> 22:24.291
When he does, will you...

22:24.427 --> 22:27.214
- No.
He told me I'd live.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.129
I think he likes me.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.097
- Then why would he want us
to kill you?

22:32.477 --> 22:35.640
What else did he say to you?
How did you even get back here?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.182
- He demanded I leave.

22:37.315 --> 22:40.273
Told me to "wake up and get out."

22:41.486 --> 22:46.105
I could've been presumptuous,
since it is my mind palace, but...

22:48.284 --> 22:49.490
That's it.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.282
That's why he wanted
you to kill me.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.488
- Wha... what are you
talking about?

22:55.625 --> 23:01.040
- I think Croatoan needed to get me
out of my mind palace, by hook or by crook.

23:01.172 --> 23:06.292
I think there's actually something
he's afraid that I can do in there.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.264
- Okay.
So, can you hurt him?

23:10.807 --> 23:12.672
- Maybe.
There were things there...

23:13.101 --> 23:16.013
There... there was mist, a tree,

23:16.145 --> 23:19.637
and a bunch of... clocks.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.649
I saw them all reset, twice.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.361
lt must've been when you guys
were losing time out here.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.198
- So you think those clocks
represent his ability

23:30.326 --> 23:31.702
to erase our memories?

23:31.828 --> 23:34.410
- Yeah, I think so.
And maybe...

23:34.539 --> 23:35.779
Guys.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.533
I can go back into my mind palace
and destroy those clocks.

23:40.670 --> 23:45.835
I can destroy Croatoan's ability
to cause lost time!

23:49.345 --> 23:51.006
- I know I don't have much time.

23:52.181 --> 23:56.345
- Then use it. You can still do
something good by helping us.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.970
- I thought about what you said.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.064
About your destiny.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.398
- Forget what I said.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.731
You choose your own destiny.
- Do we?

24:07.864 --> 24:10.230
- Yeah.
Hailie...

24:10.366 --> 24:11.867
- You warned me about this.

24:12.869 --> 24:13.858
Didn't you?

24:14.704 --> 24:17.411
When you taught me how to use
my Trouble, you told me.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.872
| just wasn't listening.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.041
- I told you about your mom.

24:23.171 --> 24:26.379
She died, mid-phase,
in a gate just like this.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.671
- Runs in the family, doesn't it?

24:35.892 --> 24:38.508
You can't escape your destiny, can you?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.220
- No, I guess you can't.

24:43.691 --> 24:47.275
(winces)

24:47.403 --> 24:50.395
(cries)

24:53.409 --> 24:55.070
I'm sorry, Hailie.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.237
I got you into this...

25:02.752 --> 25:04.413
and l have to get you out.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.045
(cracks)

25:15.181 --> 25:16.637
(gaSDS)

25:33.157 --> 25:34.146
- Duke...

26:07.024 --> 26:08.810
I'm sorry.
- You were right.

26:08.943 --> 26:12.777
I came back here thinking that I could
pick and choose my destiny.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.021
But she was always
gonna die on that fence,

26:15.158 --> 26:17.023
and l was always gonna have to kill her.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.246
Maybe I am supposed to save Haven.

26:26.294 --> 26:29.661
But it turns out I'm gonna have
to embrace what I am to do it.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.371
I'm a Crocker.

26:34.385 --> 26:35.921
And destiny's a bitch.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.968
- Time's up.
You can't fight it.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.892
When you pass out,
and you will pass out,

26:49.025 --> 26:50.515
you won't wake up.

26:51.569 --> 26:54.436
Get the aether,
while you still can.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.733
Let me give you a Trouble.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.445
Do you have another way out
of here that I don't know about?

27:00.578 --> 27:03.160
(ticking)

27:03.289 --> 27:06.281
(dripping)

27:20.848 --> 27:22.463
(Nathan coughs)

27:24.060 --> 27:25.891
You're doing the right thing.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.185
You don't need much.
It's strong stuff.

27:47.959 --> 27:49.415
- If I die...

27:50.545 --> 27:52.661
or if you kill me with this...

27:53.756 --> 27:55.257
just please...

27:55.967 --> 27:57.923
get this crystal back to Audrey.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.589
She needs it to cure the Troubles
and fight Croatoan.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.841
- Of course.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.689
- Do it.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.382
(roars)

28:59.238 --> 29:01.194
(growls)

29:02.742 --> 29:03.948
- Aah.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.032
(groaning)

29:14.128 --> 29:17.620
- What do you want?
Break him or kill him?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.255
- I wonder.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.835
What would Mara do?

29:30.186 --> 29:33.394
Well, looks like I'll be
getting out of here after all.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.013
Snap his neck
then clear the thinny.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.105
- Wait!

29:38.486 --> 29:40.226
This thing is your servant, right?

29:40.363 --> 29:41.853
Does whatever you want?

29:41.989 --> 29:44.230
That's what you were to Mara.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.403
- Just because Mara needed
the aether

29:46.535 --> 29:48.150
doesn't mean
she didn't love me.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.654
- Well, she was using you
until something better came along.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.749
And soon as it did, she jumped on it.
Literally.

29:54.877 --> 29:57.243
- What are you talking about?

29:57.380 --> 29:58.916
- Duke Crocker.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.085
- You're lying.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.209
- No.
She slept with him.

30:04.887 --> 30:08.095
Then she black-handed him
and sent him off like a bomb

30:08.224 --> 30:10.055
to Trouble the whole town.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.642
- Well, that does sound
like something she'd do.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.728
But Duke Crocker?
Really?

30:17.191 --> 30:19.273
I should kill you just for
putting that image in my head.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.563
- That's why she didn't
come back for you.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.274
'Cause she didn't need you.
She had him.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.363
And here you are,
still doing her bidding,

30:26.492 --> 30:29.074
even though she never
cared about you.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.075
- Okay, so take this ring
and make a thinny.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.076
However you can.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.797
- But Audrey...

30:43.926 --> 30:46.292
lf Nathan doesn't come back,
you have to promise me

30:46.429 --> 30:48.920
that you're not gonna go in there after him.
- Duke...

30:49.348 --> 30:50.463
I can't.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.055
- Audrey, listen to me.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.056
I saw what happened to Haven
because Nathan doesn't come back.

30:56.397 --> 30:59.139
Can you imagine what the future's
gonna look like if you disappear, too?

30:59.275 --> 31:01.641
- He is there, on the other side
of that thinny,

31:01.777 --> 31:04.610
and when you open it up,
he's coming home.

31:05.239 --> 31:06.445
- All right.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.955
- Okay.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.628
Come on.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.222
Come on.

31:38.898 --> 31:39.887
- Stop.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.533
Move that boulder.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.162
(coughs)

31:55.456 --> 31:56.992
(grunts)

32:03.089 --> 32:06.331
If you tell anyone about this...

32:09.470 --> 32:10.630
Go.

32:10.763 --> 32:13.971
- What? What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.512
Now get out of here,
before I change my mind.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.397
- Why?
- I don't know.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.357
I guess we're both fools for love.

32:25.486 --> 32:26.692
And you're right.

32:26.821 --> 32:30.359
| always knew that I loved her more.
| just didn't think that it mattered.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.151
- You still could've killed me.
- Don't tempt me.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.366
It's what Mara would've wanted.

32:39.375 --> 32:40.364
Now go.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.036
Get lost.

32:51.387 --> 32:52.877
Where did you get that?

32:54.056 --> 32:56.513
- It's one of three rings
from your world, right?

32:58.394 --> 33:00.555
Lets your kind travel home.

33:10.739 --> 33:15.358
I don't know how happy they'll be to see you,
but you don't belong here anymore, either.

33:21.750 --> 33:25.368
- Croatoan...
He really will kill everyone in Haven.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.253
You shouldn't go back.

33:41.395 --> 33:42.350
- Nathan!

33:48.611 --> 33:49.771
You came back.

33:55.576 --> 33:57.441
- I'm getting pretty good at it.

33:58.579 --> 33:59.785
- Took you long enough.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.114
- Better late than never.

34:07.463 --> 34:08.452
Where's Hailie?

34:24.021 --> 34:26.933
- Croatoan is gonna
leave my body any second.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.603
I've got to do this now,
while it's still inside.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.271
- No.
No way.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.359
Going back in there
is too dangerous.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.854
He knows we're onto him.

34:34.990 --> 34:38.198
- Hey, Dave. What do we do?
- No!

34:38.327 --> 34:39.282
- Dwight...

34:40.120 --> 34:42.156
Could you give me
a moment alone with my brother?

34:49.505 --> 34:53.293
Vincent.
I'm doing this.

34:55.386 --> 34:58.503
- You are being even stupider than usual.

34:58.889 --> 35:02.222
This mind palace stuff was my idea
and it was a terrible one.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.098
Let's just wait for Croatoan to come out.
You won't get hurt,

35:07.231 --> 35:10.849
and we'll all regroup
and come up with something else to try.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.850
- We just lost time.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.397
He can do anything.

35:14.989 --> 35:16.775
He can trick us into anything

35:16.907 --> 35:20.570
and then erase our memories
so we don't even remember.

35:20.703 --> 35:23.570
He almost got you to murder me,
for God's sake.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.240
Look”.

35:27.376 --> 35:28.741
I can't kill him.

35:30.129 --> 35:34.748
But if I can take away that ability,
it'll give you guys a fighting chance.

35:37.261 --> 35:39.252
- Dave, please.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.879
- No, I got to do this.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.970
Now go get Maddie's thingamajig.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.887
Put me back under.

36:06.957 --> 36:09.369
- As your older brother,
I order you to come back.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.291
You hear me?

36:11.420 --> 36:13.160
- Copy that, big brother.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.466
Can't let you have all the fun.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.762
Mm.

36:23.474 --> 36:26.466
(device whirring)

36:43.452 --> 36:46.444
(ticking)

36:48.457 --> 36:49.913
Hiya, Croatoan.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.328
Wherever you are.

36:53.796 --> 36:56.287
Bet you hoped l was gone.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.841
I hate an Irish goodbye.

37:00.969 --> 37:04.257
You know what really sticks
in my craw?

37:04.390 --> 37:06.802
Sure, you killed my friends.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.057
Terrorized my town.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.551
No.

37:10.938 --> 37:14.430
It's that you hitched a ride in me
without asking.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.557
Where are the manners?

37:16.693 --> 37:18.649
Monsters these days.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.653
- I know what you’re doing, Dave.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.113
But you’re wrong.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.904
Destroying some clocks can ’t hurt me.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.867
- So why do you care?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.532
- You want to be a hero?

37:29.665 --> 37:31.326
Tell your friends I’m coming.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.371
I’m coming for Audrey Parker.

37:34.795 --> 37:37.878
Shouldn’t you wake up?
Get out of here, warn them?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.042
This is your last chance to leave, Dave.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.166
- I hate to break it to you, Cro,

37:43.887 --> 37:45.548
but I'm not going anywhere.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.888
- I will destroy this place,
Dave, with you in it.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.847
I’ll be ﬁne, but you’ll be killed.

37:49.977 --> 37:51.433
Your mind ripped apart!

37:51.562 --> 37:52.927
- Now you see, Cro...

37:53.063 --> 37:55.054
When you go
and threaten me like that,

37:55.190 --> 37:58.933
that's when I can tell
that you don't like what I'm doing.

38:00.237 --> 38:02.728
- Stop! Stop!

38:03.740 --> 38:05.446
I said stop!

38:06.785 --> 38:08.491
I Will kill you!

38:17.004 --> 38:18.289
- Wake up.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.045
Please.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.873
Wake up, damn it.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.510
- Vince.
- Please.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.015
- I'm sorry.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.851
(crying)

38:50.037 --> 38:51.072
(Audrey): Hey.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.288
You did what you had to with Hailie.
Don't go thinking any different.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.827
- Yeah, that's the problem.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.669
I had to.
It was always gonna happen.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.627
- You used your curse
before and been fine.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.671
You're stronger than you think.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.509
- Yeah, my curse is stronger, too.

39:09.139 --> 39:12.006
And it came from this Croatoan, so...

39:13.435 --> 39:16.973
I'm just saying, we've been doing this
long enough to know there's always a price.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.017
I'm just wondering what it is.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.524
- But it wasn't for nothing.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.150
(Audrey): What is that?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.698
(Nathan): The Controller.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.863
I told you I'd bring you back
something nice.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.037
We did it.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.075
We're one step closer
to building a new Barn,

39:39.211 --> 39:40.951
to ending the Troubles.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.548
- And sending Croatoan back
to where he belongs.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.089
- Well, I love it already.
What does it do?

39:46.218 --> 39:47.458
-We||...

39:52.057 --> 39:53.137
Parker?

40:01.358 --> 40:02.768
- Yep, I got nothing.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.064
- Okay.
So we found it but...

40:06.196 --> 40:08.573
we don't know what it does
or how to use it.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.239
All right.
Good on us.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.868
- We have no idea what we're doing.
Again.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.200
But at least you two
aren't punching each other,

40:18.333 --> 40:21.291
I'm still Audrey,
and Haven hasn't blown up.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.500
Yet.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.586
It's us.
The three of us.

40:26.508 --> 40:30.342
We're back, and we will figure it out.

40:32.014 --> 40:33.003
Somehow.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.007
- Yeah, I can't argue with that.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.783
- I'm so sorry.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.409
How did this happen?

41:00.208 --> 41:02.460
(groans)

41:05.047 --> 41:08.005
(Croatoan): He was braver than I thought.
He died well.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.294
- Croatoan.
- You son of a bitch.

41:10.427 --> 41:11.758
You killed my brother!

41:12.721 --> 41:15.337
- If it’s any consolation, he succeeded.

41:15.474 --> 41:19.308
But it doesn’t matter.
I don ’t need to erase memories anymore.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.267
I don ’t have to hide.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.478
It’s time.

41:23.607 --> 41:24.596
(Dwight): For what?

41:48.340 --> 41:49.671
Did he leave?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.415
- Where could he have gone?

41:58.517 --> 42:01.008
- Look.
On his hand.

42:06.942 --> 42:07.977
- It's Dave's handwriting.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.358
He got a message to us.

42:12.364 --> 42:13.353
Oh...

42:17.369 --> 42:20.702
"He's coming for Audrey."

42:48.692 --> 42:51.559
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
