becomes that much more important
for both of them,

48:58.370 --> 49:00.067
as leaders
of Alexandria.

49:09.163 --> 49:10.512
[Laughs]

49:10.556 --> 49:12.079
Gabriel: Little help.

49:12.123 --> 49:14.125
We intended for the episode
to be funny.

49:14.168 --> 49:16.040
I think, you know, my writers,
Jim and Eric,

49:16.083 --> 49:19.869
did a really great job balancing
both the seriousness

49:19.913 --> 49:21.262
of some of the situations
they're in,

49:21.306 --> 49:24.309
as well as the levity
that they find in that.

49:24.352 --> 49:26.746
What?

49:26.789 --> 49:28.052
That was quite
the scream.

49:30.750 --> 49:32.273
These things
are vicious.

49:32.317 --> 49:34.928
Underneath all of it,
they're on the same team,

49:34.972 --> 49:36.886
they want to get
the same thing done.

49:36.930 --> 49:39.063
And they can make fun
of each other a little bit,

49:39.106 --> 49:40.281
and make fun of themselves
a little bit.

49:40.325 --> 49:41.369
[Laughs]

49:41.413 --> 49:42.718
Alright.

49:42.762 --> 49:44.764
[Laughs]

49:44.807 --> 49:46.026
Let it all out.

49:46.070 --> 49:47.897
I think that
that's really important,

49:47.941 --> 49:50.161
to kind of cut against, like,
some of the real darkness

49:50.204 --> 49:52.163
that you see
in this episode, too.

49:52.206 --> 49:54.382
We've had a rough day,
you know?

49:58.082 --> 50:00.954
Part of the centerpiece
of this episode is,

50:00.998 --> 50:03.565
these two guys,
they get drunk.

50:03.609 --> 50:07.004
And I think, like, that's a
very, very human impulse.

50:07.047 --> 50:09.963
Just like the real pandemic
that we've been living through,

50:10.007 --> 50:12.922
like, people want to find
moments in there

50:12.966 --> 50:16.056
where you can just unwind
from it all.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.927
Wow.

50:17.971 --> 50:19.320
Exactly.

50:19.364 --> 50:21.148
These guys start getting
kind of honest

50:21.192 --> 50:23.020
about some of the things
they're thinking about.

50:23.063 --> 50:26.110
Seth Gilliam does this beautiful
job in this monologue.

50:26.153 --> 50:29.069
And that's all just done
in one take.

50:29.113 --> 50:32.072
It is so hard to pull something
off like that,

50:32.116 --> 50:34.118
where, just,
throughout the performance,

50:34.161 --> 50:36.555
he captures all these little
moments that are in there,

50:36.598 --> 50:38.165
and you really get a sense
of the thoughts

50:38.209 --> 50:39.775
running through
his head.

50:39.819 --> 50:43.170
I don't want
to preach anymore.

50:43.214 --> 50:46.217
Why?

50:46.260 --> 50:48.306
Do you really think
things are gonna go back

50:48.349 --> 50:50.308
to the way they were?

50:50.351 --> 50:53.137
Here's this person that I think
has come a really long way.

50:53.180 --> 50:55.356
And so, it's really, like,
lovely to see him

50:55.400 --> 50:59.099
be vulnerable about what faith
and human connection

50:59.143 --> 51:01.232
meant to him,
but to also see him say,

51:01.275 --> 51:03.625
"I don't think that's
for me anymore."

51:03.669 --> 51:08.674
Evil people aren't the exception
to the rule.

51:08.717 --> 51:10.241
They are the rule.

51:10.284 --> 51:13.157
That's a bold claim.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.116
And I think that Gabriel
might have started off

51:16.160 --> 51:17.683
in a place like that,
at one point.

51:17.726 --> 51:19.685
But seeing the darkness
within himself,

51:19.728 --> 51:22.470
as well as within others,
I think there's a part of him

51:22.514 --> 51:25.256
that thinks, "Maybe I'm not
a worthy vessel of God,

51:25.299 --> 51:28.172
because I don't believe
that I see goodness

51:28.215 --> 51:30.652
in His creation anymore."

51:30.696 --> 51:34.003
Man: The boar --
how was it?

51:34.047 --> 51:36.397
It was good.

51:36.441 --> 51:40.271
♪♪

51:40.314 --> 51:41.837
I'd like a bite.

51:41.881 --> 51:43.622
He comes out,
and he's got this big gun.

51:43.665 --> 51:45.058
And, you know,
it's Robert Patrick,

51:45.102 --> 51:48.192
who we were so,
so excited to cast.

51:48.235 --> 51:51.717
He's just got this real easy
menace about him,

51:51.760 --> 51:53.284
and the way he
inhabits this role.

51:53.327 --> 51:55.721
He can just play
that gravitas

51:55.764 --> 51:58.158
where you just know,
from the first minute
you see him, like,

51:58.202 --> 52:00.117
this is not somebody
to be trifled with.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.466
And that's great.

52:01.509 --> 52:03.946
Man: Well, you got
a choice.

52:03.990 --> 52:07.689
Each time, you can
point it at yourself

52:07.733 --> 52:09.474
or the man
sitting across from you.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.608
Winner goes home.

52:13.652 --> 52:16.437
Kang: Mays wants them to play
this Russian roulette game,

52:16.481 --> 52:18.439
but once you get to
the end of the episode,

52:18.483 --> 52:21.921
you realize this is a guy
who clearly made his brother

52:21.964 --> 52:25.316
play the same game, and the
brother shot his own family,

52:25.359 --> 52:27.622
and then, was kept
as a prisoner for,

52:27.666 --> 52:29.058
like, the rest
of his years.

52:29.102 --> 52:31.974
This is who people are!
This is truth!

52:32.018 --> 52:33.324
You're wrong.

52:33.367 --> 52:36.283
From Mays' perspective,
human nature

52:36.327 --> 52:39.765
is to do the selfish thing
that helps you survive

52:39.808 --> 52:41.245
as an individual.

52:41.288 --> 52:44.161
He fully believes that,
when he gives that gun

52:44.204 --> 52:46.511
to these two guys
who act like they're friends,

52:46.554 --> 52:49.731
they will ultimately
turn the gun on each other.

52:54.301 --> 52:56.956
Mays is kind of, like,
watching this,

52:56.999 --> 53:00.655
and gets increasingly frustrated
by the fact that the game

53:00.699 --> 53:02.570
didn't go
the way he thought it would.

53:02.614 --> 53:05.965
That rips apart
his entire worldview.

53:06.008 --> 53:09.098
To prove how evil man is?
Is that what this is about?

53:09.142 --> 53:11.013
You think I'm gonna shoot him,
or he's gonna shoot me?

53:11.057 --> 53:12.493
Quiet.

53:12.537 --> 53:14.321
In his mind, you know,
he thinks Gabriel

53:14.365 --> 53:17.106
is relying on this book,
the Bible,

53:17.150 --> 53:19.283
which he thinks
is stupid.

53:19.326 --> 53:21.894
For Gabriel,
what he takes from the Bible

53:21.937 --> 53:24.157
is that
there is light.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.290
In spite of anything else
that's in there,

53:26.333 --> 53:28.509
in spite of the darkness,
there's a message in there.

53:28.553 --> 53:29.858
We can help you.

53:31.773 --> 53:33.210
I don't believe you.

53:33.253 --> 53:34.994
Is Gabriel even
telling the truth?

53:35.037 --> 53:36.213
The whole thing
was a bluff.

53:36.256 --> 53:38.606
So, we sort of don't know
whether Gabriel

53:38.650 --> 53:40.956
even fully believes the things
that he's saying anymore.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.133
So, maybe Mays is right,
because Gabriel lied,

53:44.177 --> 53:46.223
and killed him.

53:46.266 --> 53:47.789
My name is Mays.
