WEBVTT

00:23.688 --> 00:25.429
Here you go, miss.

00:25.471 --> 00:27.561
Purse-snatching, sector one.

00:27.581 --> 00:29.074
On it.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.464
There he is.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.490
Hey! Security! Stop!

00:46.527 --> 00:48.214
Out of the way!

01:00.235 --> 01:01.089
Stupid ass.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.890
Give me the purse.

01:03.171 --> 01:05.516
What is this stuff?

01:17.073 --> 01:18.815
Holy mother...

01:31.680 --> 01:33.140
Alexx...

01:33.550 --> 01:35.170
what do we got?

01:35.210 --> 01:37.070
New one, Horatio.

01:37.414 --> 01:41.279
Poor thing's covered in slime,
and it's not suntan oil.

01:41.327 --> 01:43.516
I'm sending it to Trace.

01:43.535 --> 01:45.871
What are the marks
on the face and neck?

01:47.488 --> 01:49.361
Puncture wounds.

01:49.394 --> 01:53.569
Two rows of 'em.
Couldn't tell you what made 'em.

01:53.594 --> 01:56.157
What in the world
happened to you, sweetie?

01:56.190 --> 01:57.464
We get an ID?

01:57.499 --> 02:01.851
Yeah, uh, friend identified her
as Tanya Fhurman from Chicago,

02:01.876 --> 02:04.105
here to celebrate her 21st birthday.

02:04.131 --> 02:07.081
Well, she won't have
a 22nd, will she?

02:07.097 --> 02:09.912
Friend said she came down to
drink mojitos and catch some sun.

02:09.948 --> 02:11.570
Well, it looks like...

02:11.586 --> 02:13.434
something....

02:13.450 --> 02:14.376
caught her.

03:02.642 --> 03:04.038
Go on.
Take just one more.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.847
I'll drink you guys under the table.

03:05.847 --> 03:08.028
You mean bed.

03:08.784 --> 03:10.156
You believe these people?

03:10.178 --> 03:14.742
No reason why a little homicide
should interrupt your sun time.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.346
Well, look who's here.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.198
Horatio and Alexx
filled us in out front.

03:26.217 --> 03:27.858
Surprised they had anything to say.

03:27.891 --> 03:29.392
No COD, no eyewits.

03:29.416 --> 03:31.163
So what do you have?

03:32.599 --> 03:34.753
You're looking at it.
That's the crime scene.

03:34.768 --> 03:36.918
All right, look, you snap, I'll dust.

03:36.938 --> 03:37.846
Okay.

03:43.855 --> 03:45.421
What is this stuff?

03:45.968 --> 03:48.352
We've never seen anything
like this before.

03:52.824 --> 03:54.229
Excuse me.

03:55.073 --> 03:56.501
Can you help me?

03:58.162 --> 03:59.077
I'm sorry.

03:59.093 --> 04:00.806
I got it, Delko.

04:04.743 --> 04:06.941
I know you're dealing
with a bigger thing, but, um,

04:06.959 --> 04:10.521
my purse was stolen this morning, and
I think that Security might've recovered it?

04:10.538 --> 04:13.652
Yeah, yeah, they did. Patrol gave it
to us. It's the chain of custody.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.769
Do you have any identification?

04:15.944 --> 04:17.762
In my purse.

04:17.786 --> 04:18.653
Right.

04:19.779 --> 04:21.382
Hey, I got you covered.

04:26.409 --> 04:30.066
Well, I'm just grateful you got the guy.
That handbag cost me half a paycheck.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.642
All I need is your name,
date of birth and social.

04:33.661 --> 04:38.557
Karla Jane Gardner.
July 21, 1980. 998-87-2646.

04:38.575 --> 04:41.267
Okay, perfect. Perfect.

04:41.962 --> 04:44.369
All I have to do is run your license.

04:49.086 --> 04:50.487
That's a nice picture.

04:50.989 --> 04:52.290
Thank you.

04:54.456 --> 04:55.603
Uh-oh.

04:55.638 --> 04:56.832
What?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.798
Your license has been flagged.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.271
You're wanted for fraud.

05:01.312 --> 05:02.941
No, I'm not.

05:02.972 --> 05:06.176
Uh, you haven't paid your car loan in
six months. The bank has filed charges.

05:06.195 --> 05:08.305
I know, but not against me.

05:09.010 --> 05:09.927
Are you Karla Gardner?

05:09.945 --> 05:12.113
Yes,  but there's this
girl impersonating me.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.270
Oh, yeah? She do your accent,
your mannerisms, stuff like that?

05:15.287 --> 05:16.839
She stole my identity.

05:16.861 --> 05:19.432
I write checks to my creditors. She drains
my account while they're in the mail.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.926
I get charged with
fraud every few months.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.387
That's why I carry this.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.943
"Affidavit of Fraud"...

05:31.655 --> 05:33.404
Federal Trade Commission.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.475
Identity theft site told me to get it.

05:35.490 --> 05:43.255
The FTC can't file criminal charges against this
person, but it does help in situations like this.

05:45.517 --> 05:46.843
I'm  sorry.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.462
It's not your fault. It's not
anyone's fault. That's the problem.

05:51.194 --> 05:54.205
But if I find this girl,
and she ends up dead...

05:55.058 --> 05:58.204
You know, if that's a bona fide threat,
I'm going to have to detain you.

05:58.438 --> 06:00.550
It's wishful thinking, okay?

06:02.133 --> 06:03.353
Really.

06:04.852 --> 06:05.769
Okay.

06:12.475 --> 06:13.231
Alexx,

06:13.253 --> 06:16.658
the liquid on the girl is gastric acid.

06:16.695 --> 06:20.294
Then I'm not crazy, 'cause I'm pretty sure
these puncture wounds are teeth marks.

06:21.312 --> 06:25.114
Something devoured this
poor girl head-first.

06:25.878 --> 06:29.107
She was passed out
from too many mojitos.

06:29.553 --> 06:32.323
Something with a very strong stomach.

06:34.010 --> 06:36.112
Pythoncholic acid?

06:36.514 --> 06:38.449
Horatio, you telling me
it was a snake?

06:38.472 --> 06:43.105
Could be a python or a boa,
maybe as large as 200 pounds.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.974
Makes sense. Got petechiae,

06:56.995 --> 06:59.455
several broken ribs.

06:59.482 --> 07:01.688
She had the life squeezed out of her.

07:03.293 --> 07:07.667
Every time you breathe out, the snake
tightens his grip, doesn't he?

07:15.888 --> 07:19.702
After she was dead, snake
swallowed her. Got your slime.

07:20.014 --> 07:24.275
Explains the nasty teeth marks.
They're from walking up her.

07:24.293 --> 07:26.918
So one question, Horatio:

07:27.738 --> 07:29.520
where's a snake like that come from?

07:29.540 --> 07:33.158
That is a very good question,
Alexx. Excuse me.

07:33.189 --> 07:34.498
Eric?

07:35.665 --> 07:36.471
Yeah?

07:36.801 --> 07:37.817
Yeah, okay.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.948
No way I heard that right.

07:42.484 --> 07:44.447
At least now we know
what we're looking for.

07:44.473 --> 07:47.681
But snakes don't normally go
after humans. Why attack the girl?

07:47.696 --> 07:51.711
Probably because she was sunburned. Snakes
use infrared to track their prey in the dark.

07:51.726 --> 07:57.548
They have, uh, heat-detecting pits around their
mouths. Gives them a thermal image of the prey.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.400
So we know how it found her.
How do we find it?

08:02.420 --> 08:06.450
Well, unlike humans, snakes don't go
far from the scene of a crime.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.450
Usually look for a dark, snug place.
They move along walls, in, uh, crevices...

08:11.510 --> 08:13.540
So think like a snake.

08:13.567 --> 08:17.424
- If you see it, don't try to catch it yourself.
- You don't have to worry about that.

08:54.770 --> 08:56.407
Delko, I got something.

09:01.471 --> 09:02.860
So, what have you got?

09:02.891 --> 09:04.293
That slime.

09:05.173 --> 09:06.677
Here you go.

09:06.709 --> 09:09.923
One, two, three... Atta girl...

09:09.940 --> 09:10.724
Follow it with this guy.

09:10.747 --> 09:11.623
Excuse me.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.751
MDPD. I'm going to have
to ask you to get off the bed.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.772
- Dude, could it wait?
- Sure.

09:16.794 --> 09:18.498
The big snake under there'll
eventually come out.

09:18.507 --> 09:19.333
Snake?!

09:19.361 --> 09:21.984
Hey, slowly, slowly.

09:22.114 --> 09:23.438
Let's go.

09:24.336 --> 09:25.638
Want to help the lady?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.819
This hole in the mattress...

09:40.898 --> 09:42.416
Got you.

09:44.893 --> 09:47.013
Delko, you said snakes
don't like to travel?

09:47.031 --> 09:48.046
That's right.

09:48.068 --> 09:50.612
Check that out. Broken branch.

09:50.962 --> 09:53.705
Maybe came out of the window,
down the tree?

09:58.607 --> 10:01.560
- Led right to the cabana.
- Girl never saw it coming.

10:02.182 --> 10:03.706
I hope not.

10:08.337 --> 10:09.967
What the hell are you doing?

10:11.256 --> 10:13.375
Apprehending the suspect.

10:13.393 --> 10:14.873
I don't know.

10:22.034 --> 10:23.784
Give me a hand, Frank.

10:41.956 --> 10:43.578
Think I'm going to be sick.

10:43.596 --> 10:46.422
Relax. It's dead.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.304
How'd that happen?

10:48.487 --> 10:50.270
I don't know.
Necropsy will tell us.

10:50.296 --> 10:52.150
I'm going to call H.

10:53.044 --> 10:56.618
If the snake was in one of those rooms,
that means someone checked it in.

11:06.426 --> 11:08.701
Got something on the window ledge.

11:09.897 --> 11:11.201
Scales.

11:11.807 --> 11:14.247
- Same color as the boa.
- Gentlemen...

11:14.625 --> 11:17.848
Front Desk says a
Low Dawg Productions booked this room.

11:17.863 --> 11:19.773
Who is Low Dawg Productions, Frank?

11:19.788 --> 11:21.653
Offshore holding company
out of the Bahamas.

11:21.669 --> 11:23.169
No taxes, no liabilities.

11:23.193 --> 11:24.956
Okay, let's figure out who owns it.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.637
- I do love a challenge.
- All right, Frank.

11:27.661 --> 11:29.469
Check this out.

11:29.494 --> 11:32.247
That may have been how they got
the snake in here, Eric.

11:32.264 --> 11:33.113
Yeah.

11:34.416 --> 11:37.127
Answers one question and raises another.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.447
Is that a tooth?

11:38.471 --> 11:39.210
Yeah.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.823
Too small to be from our snake,
and it's definitely not human.

11:42.845 --> 11:46.196
Okay, let's get it to the lab and
figure out what else we're dealing with.

11:46.211 --> 11:47.191
All right.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.819
Excuse me. Can you help me?
I'm looking for CSI Wolfe?

11:53.711 --> 11:54.355
Speaking.

11:54.377 --> 11:58.928
A  policeman at the Dominick said that you had
my purse. A guy snatched it from me this morning.

11:58.949 --> 12:01.721
Karla. You're Karla?

12:01.986 --> 12:05.560
Oh, please do not tell me
that she did it again.

12:06.424 --> 12:08.777
A girl showed up about
my age. Said she was me?

12:08.797 --> 12:11.162
Her picture was on
the license, and, um....

12:11.183 --> 12:13.154
she had an Affidavit of Fraud.

12:13.172 --> 12:15.273
From the FTC? Did it look
something like this?

12:15.291 --> 12:18.442
Or how about police reports
from three different cities,

12:18.458 --> 12:22.374
or how about my notice to
the fraud unit of the FBI?

12:23.494 --> 12:26.347
Would you wait here while
I contact a more...

12:26.378 --> 12:27.719
um,

12:27.749 --> 12:29.925
senior colleague?

12:30.539 --> 12:34.983
I spoke with patrol. If it's any consolation,
we apprehended the man who stole your purse.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.844
And then he gave it to my thief.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.587
All due respect, she had
proper identification.

12:39.616 --> 12:42.463
It would be easier if Florida licenses
had thumbprints, like some other states.

12:42.514 --> 12:47.223
No, 'cause she would've gotten around that,
too, because she gets around everything.

12:50.298 --> 12:52.918
I am sorry. I'm frustrated.

12:54.776 --> 12:56.826
When did this start?

12:56.848 --> 12:59.285
It started a year and a half ago.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.947
Coral Gables PD looked into it,

13:01.962 --> 13:05.355
thinks that she got it out of my trash.

13:11.216 --> 13:14.284
Some mailer that I threw out
for cheap loans.

13:14.285 --> 13:17.698
She filled it out, had it
sent back to her address.

13:31.482 --> 13:36.552
The funny thing is, I'd just
gotten divorced. I thought I was
going to start this whole new life.

13:37.132 --> 13:38.621
And she took it.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.752
Would you excuse us for a minute?

13:42.139 --> 13:42.933
Of course.

13:49.657 --> 13:50.905
What do you think?

13:50.932 --> 13:55.322
Well, the other woman had documentation,
too. And talked a good story.

13:55.339 --> 13:58.759
Yeah, for all we know,
she could be the identity thief.

13:59.428 --> 14:01.438
Do you have the address
the other Karla gave you?

14:01.457 --> 14:06.420
1122 Panama Street, Number 19.
I scanned it into the Hummer.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.539
I'll go pay her a visit.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.060
I'll put a call to the State Attorney.

14:17.262 --> 14:18.771
Eric?

14:18.807 --> 14:21.423
The tooth we found
in the duffel bag is reptilian,

14:21.448 --> 14:23.676
doesn't belong to a
snake at all, though.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.286
Caiman lizard.

14:25.306 --> 14:27.376
Native to the Amazon Basin
of South America.

14:27.391 --> 14:29.371
So it had to be shipped here.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.490
Exactly. I checked with Customs.

14:31.506 --> 14:34.831
Got a crate of caiman lizards
yesterday at the Port of Miami.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.706
Wait a minute. Yesterday?

14:38.510 --> 14:40.559
Shouldn't they still
be in quarantine then?

14:40.581 --> 14:43.049
They should be, but
they got special exemption.

14:43.069 --> 14:44.539
How did that happen?

14:44.555 --> 14:48.861
The importer's some big shot
herpetologist. His name's Dr. Rod Merrick.

14:49.091 --> 14:51.485
checks out the lizards
before they go to the zoo.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.590
Gets a pass from Customs.

14:52.606 --> 14:56.211
Well, he's not gonna get a pass
from us. Bring the doctor in.

14:56.628 --> 14:58.148
What a waste.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.013
I haven't imported a boa in five years.

15:02.029 --> 15:03.975
I wouldn't even know
where to put one this size.

15:04.021 --> 15:06.639
Yeah, well, somebody put it
in a bag with caiman lizards.

15:06.692 --> 15:08.958
You do import those, don't you, Rod?

15:08.993 --> 15:10.638
Yeah, I do.

15:10.673 --> 15:12.781
And half of my last shipment arrived dead.

15:13.381 --> 15:15.283
Well, a snake this size could do that.

15:16.438 --> 15:17.703
There was no snake.

15:18.186 --> 15:20.187
Look, I've been making
these shipments for years,

15:20.222 --> 15:21.711
Okay? I've never had a single problem.

15:21.746 --> 15:22.670
Till now.

15:23.437 --> 15:26.819
And quarantine exemption makes it
easy to sneak anything past customs.

15:26.854 --> 15:29.894
And by "anything," Mr.
Delko means drugs, Rod.

15:30.893 --> 15:32.382
Wh... What are you talking about?

15:33.225 --> 15:35.651
I'm not sure, yet,
till I open that snake,

15:35.686 --> 15:36.575
but till then,

15:37.195 --> 15:38.774
I want you to stay put.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.989
Looks like part of a pill.

15:57.653 --> 15:58.990
Our snake was a mule.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.365
Let Horatio know.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.893
There were probably more.

16:03.453 --> 16:05.995
Snake absorbed some
of it before it died.

16:06.030 --> 16:08.554
So that explains why it
regurgitated the girl.

16:08.966 --> 16:11.239
Whoever opened up this
snake knew where to look.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.864
But had no surgical skill.

16:13.899 --> 16:16.223
That rules out our snake expert.

16:17.732 --> 16:20.637
Got what looks like broken glass, too.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.414
Squeezed the girl, broke a vial.

16:26.131 --> 16:27.488
Overdosed.

16:28.056 --> 16:29.623
I'm gonna need that pill.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.758
Frank, go ahead.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.573
Found out who Low Dawg Productions is.
It's an old friend of yours.

16:36.608 --> 16:38.317
- You near a computer?
- I am.

16:38.352 --> 16:40.378
Registered with Florida
Department of State.

16:40.413 --> 16:41.410
Okay, good.

16:44.473 --> 16:48.599
Florida Department of State,
please, Low Dawg Productions.

16:59.193 --> 17:04.434
When you're in Miami, we never close.

17:08.537 --> 17:09.460
Excuse me.

17:12.877 --> 17:15.800
Yes, um, Clavo Cruz, please.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.247
He is?

17:17.281 --> 17:18.726
Which pier would that be?

17:19.730 --> 17:20.522
Thank you.

17:21.358 --> 17:22.375
Thank you.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.969
Now, that is sick.

17:40.949 --> 17:42.215
Just look at it, huh?

17:42.868 --> 17:46.158
Sweet. Wait till I get my dubs on, huh?

17:46.193 --> 17:48.486
Yo. Wipe your feet.

18:02.135 --> 18:03.656
Lieutenant Caine.

18:05.106 --> 18:06.353
Clavo  Cruz.

18:06.388 --> 18:07.098
Hi.

18:07.525 --> 18:11.028
Clavo, is that your brand-new
Lamborghini over there?

18:11.063 --> 18:14.652
Yeah. The last one I had,
it's no good to me anymore.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.850
Some puta painted it red.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.481
- Some puta?
- Yeah.

18:23.516 --> 18:26.018
You know, Clavo, I haven't
forgotten Tess Kendall.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.849
And I haven't forgotten you.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.666
Neither has my brother.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.029
Do you remember, Clavo,

18:32.064 --> 18:34.380
what I said to you the last time we met?

18:35.260 --> 18:36.084
Yeah.

18:36.119 --> 18:39.192
"We never close."

18:39.227 --> 18:40.356
Yeah, "We never close."

18:40.391 --> 18:42.333
Just like 7-Eleven, dawg.

18:44.673 --> 18:48.004
Speaking of which, Low
Dawg Productions, Clavo.

18:49.782 --> 18:51.967
I got no idea what you're talking about,

18:52.237 --> 18:55.709
but the Vienna Convention
that's still for shizzle.

18:55.744 --> 18:58.340
I don't care about your diplomat father.

18:58.692 --> 19:01.405
Are you smuggling drugs
into South Florida?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.581
Drugs?

19:03.152 --> 19:05.001
No, see, I was in Italy,

19:05.036 --> 19:07.064
picking this baby right
off the assembly line.

19:07.099 --> 19:09.263
I just went through your
room at the Dominick, Clavo,

19:09.298 --> 19:12.820
and your exotic "mule"
has just killed a girl.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.058
Are you deaf?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.514
Because I got immunity.

19:17.549 --> 19:19.247
Just like your brother, as I recall,

19:19.282 --> 19:21.046
and we both know where he is, don't we?

19:22.630 --> 19:24.520
I'm nothing like Ramon, Caine.

19:24.555 --> 19:28.659
You're not gonna catch me floating
around in international waters, Caine.

19:28.694 --> 19:30.108
But you know what? I'm gonna
catch you doing something.

19:30.143 --> 19:31.482
You're threatening me, Caine?

19:32.590 --> 19:33.926
That's not a threat.

19:33.961 --> 19:35.900
That's a guarantee.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.359
Buckle up, ma'am.

19:44.131 --> 19:45.034
Calleigh.

19:45.069 --> 19:46.905
Did you go to your Karla's place?

19:46.940 --> 19:50.111
Her place was an office building,
and Apartment 19 was a PO box.

19:52.754 --> 19:54.653
It's an amazingly simple scam.

19:54.688 --> 19:55.731
Look.

19:55.766 --> 19:58.606
An electronic transfer for
Karla Gardner's paycheck

19:58.641 --> 20:01.276
into a bogus Karla
Gardner checking account.

20:01.496 --> 20:03.281
Someone's living high on the hog.

20:03.316 --> 20:05.581
Spa... Lux lease.

20:05.616 --> 20:07.233
Fake Karla runs up the bills;

20:07.268 --> 20:09.057
Real Karla gets charged with theft.

20:10.946 --> 20:12.203
Lunch at Zobu.

20:13.422 --> 20:14.732
She eats well.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.733
Looks like every Monday.

20:16.768 --> 20:18.245
You know what today is?

20:22.048 --> 20:23.467
Be right back.

20:25.209 --> 20:25.946
Dimitri.

20:25.981 --> 20:27.096
Is my table open?

20:29.367 --> 20:30.248
Hi.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.496
Officer.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.944
Hi. Did you want to join me for lunch?

20:34.979 --> 20:37.357
Sure, as long as we take it to go.

20:37.534 --> 20:38.663
Do you mind?

20:40.534 --> 20:41.910
I've got a dozen more.

20:42.611 --> 20:43.956
What is this all about?

20:43.991 --> 20:45.220
Identity theft.

20:45.255 --> 20:47.850
Good. I'm sick of this girl
passing herself off as me.

20:53.157 --> 20:54.599
This is humiliating.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.270
What is this thing?

20:59.552 --> 21:00.921
It's a fluoroscope.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.829
What's it do?

21:06.492 --> 21:08.243
It reads bones.

21:08.278 --> 21:09.898
And how does that tell you anything?

21:10.497 --> 21:13.223
The real Karla Gardner
sustained some fractures.

21:13.691 --> 21:14.902
Interesting.

21:14.937 --> 21:16.298
How would you know that?

21:18.088 --> 21:22.033
We got a hold of the broker who underwrote
the medical insurance policy back in '99.

21:22.068 --> 21:25.017
That was four years before
the identity theft happened.

21:25.052 --> 21:28.967
Makes the girl whose fractures
match this, the authentic Karla.

21:40.559 --> 21:41.896
Documented proof:

21:41.931 --> 21:45.500
The real Karla Gardner broke her
right arm windsurfing in college.

21:45.535 --> 21:46.384
I'm such a klutz.

21:46.419 --> 21:48.016
I don't know what I was doing out there.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.672
We're gonna scope you next.

21:50.707 --> 21:51.915
You better.

22:08.044 --> 22:10.363
Did you also break your
femur in two places?

22:12.923 --> 22:13.913
Maybe.

22:14.170 --> 22:16.243
With attendant radiating fractures?

22:18.447 --> 22:19.641
You're under arrest.

22:20.142 --> 22:21.364
What's your real name?

22:21.399 --> 22:22.837
I'm not saying another word.

22:30.031 --> 22:31.097
What does this mean?

22:31.803 --> 22:34.270
Well, your life's going to get better.

22:35.149 --> 22:36.893
Oh, my God.

22:36.928 --> 22:38.165
You're free to go.

22:39.371 --> 22:41.539
How I can thank you both?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.802
We're just glad we could help.

22:47.292 --> 22:48.757
Thank you again.

22:48.792 --> 22:50.142
Yeah. Take care.

22:58.550 --> 22:59.445
Bye.

23:06.491 --> 23:07.707
Calleigh, what's going on?

23:08.702 --> 23:10.323
The State Attorney says
the case won't make.

23:10.358 --> 23:11.610
But we've got a paper trail.

23:11.645 --> 23:13.705
We got fake loans,
illegal money transfers.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.510
We can't prove that the
real girl didn't do that.

23:15.589 --> 23:17.705
QD can help us show that
the signatures are fake.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.948
Ink analysis, rag content.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.813
Nonviolent crime is not a priority.

23:21.848 --> 23:23.841
And we cannot ask the
State Attorney to prosecute.

23:23.876 --> 23:25.925
I can't believe this. This
is not what I signed up for.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.926
Well, we got the real girl her life back

23:28.961 --> 23:30.269
and I think that counts for something.

23:30.304 --> 23:32.629
And if the fake goes out there and
steals somebody else's identity?

23:33.481 --> 23:35.816
You're going to drive yourself
crazy with hypotheticals.

23:36.379 --> 23:37.495
I'll see you later.

23:49.211 --> 23:51.084
Results on the pill we
pulled from the snake?

23:51.628 --> 23:52.796
It's not "E."

23:53.322 --> 23:54.794
Paramethoxyamphetamine.

23:54.829 --> 23:55.809
PMA.

23:55.844 --> 23:56.930
Red Death.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.817
It's usually stamped
with three diamonds.

23:58.852 --> 23:59.993
Kids think it's ecstasy.

24:00.028 --> 24:02.327
Yeah, except it takes a
half-hour longer to kick in,

24:02.362 --> 24:05.746
so kids re-up, makes
it easy to overdose.

24:05.846 --> 24:07.722
That's why it kills half
the people who take it.

24:08.557 --> 24:10.086
Once it gets to the lower intestine,

24:10.121 --> 24:11.814
it dissolves into the bloodstream,

24:12.068 --> 24:13.741
makes its way up to the hypothalamus,

24:13.776 --> 24:15.312
which is the body's thermostat,

24:15.847 --> 24:16.926
and then it turns up the heat

24:17.175 --> 24:19.799
quickly, 107, 108 degrees.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.402
Cooks your brain like an egg.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.799
This stuff is seriously dangerous.

24:23.834 --> 24:25.676
Yeah, and so's the guy importing it.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.635
Site of rave at Palm Towers

24:32.670 --> 24:34.044
Hotel parking structure B.

24:34.913 --> 24:37.945
19-year-old male dead from
overdose of an unknown substance.

24:39.971 --> 24:40.782
Excuse me.

24:40.817 --> 24:41.823
Are you Hillary?

24:43.606 --> 24:45.293
We understand that
was a friend of yours.

24:45.328 --> 24:47.549
Kevin, yeah.

24:47.869 --> 24:50.061
You and Kevin buy pills
for today's get-together?

24:50.929 --> 24:52.761
Pills? No.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.536
Hillary, the drug that you
purchased is called Red Death.

24:55.571 --> 24:56.384
It's poison.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.382
The guy said it was "E."

25:01.990 --> 25:03.062
Did you take any?

25:04.977 --> 25:06.762
Didn't do anything at first.

25:07.430 --> 25:10.896
My friends all re-upped,
but I decided to wait it out.

25:11.168 --> 25:12.490
Where'd you get it?

25:15.192 --> 25:16.617
I don't know, some guy.

25:16.902 --> 25:19.158
Hillary, more people are going to die.

25:19.193 --> 25:20.590
Is that what you want?

25:24.491 --> 25:26.429
He was off of Ocean,

25:27.586 --> 25:29.442
by the parking structure.

25:33.316 --> 25:34.220
Thank you, ma'am.

25:35.156 --> 25:36.560
Take your hands off me.

25:36.595 --> 25:37.473
Put your hands up.

25:37.508 --> 25:38.209
What is this?

25:38.244 --> 25:39.861
I ain't bothering nobody.

25:43.424 --> 25:44.535
Who dimed me out?

25:48.627 --> 25:50.678
Hmm. Thank you, Frank.

25:55.044 --> 25:56.510
Billy Palmero.

25:56.545 --> 25:57.756
One death, Billy,

25:57.791 --> 26:00.118
and two overdoses from
the drugs you're selling.

26:00.153 --> 26:01.094
I ain't selling.

26:02.557 --> 26:03.743
Hey, those aren't mine.

26:03.778 --> 26:05.350
Let me guess: you're
holding 'em for a friend?

26:06.361 --> 26:08.571
A friend that knows you
work on the docks, Billy?

26:08.966 --> 26:10.230
So I pull some shifts down at the Port.

26:10.265 --> 26:10.927
So what?

26:10.962 --> 26:12.907
Do those shifts involve Animal Control?

26:16.797 --> 26:18.286
Look, I just wanted my fair share.

26:18.321 --> 26:19.034
Of what?

26:19.069 --> 26:20.283
Your share of the drug money?

26:20.767 --> 26:22.657
I'm risking my job scanning imports,

26:22.692 --> 26:24.793
so the guy that harvests
the dope makes all the cash?

26:24.828 --> 26:25.989
Come on.

26:25.996 --> 26:27.364
Why don't you tell us this guy's name?

26:30.282 --> 26:31.273
It's Clavo.

26:32.851 --> 26:33.678
Cruz.

26:35.697 --> 26:37.977
Can I count on your
testimony in court, Billy?

26:39.407 --> 26:40.777
No way I do that.

26:41.591 --> 26:42.639
I'm a dead man.

26:43.158 --> 26:45.759
Another one of these kids
dies, you may wish you were.

26:54.712 --> 26:57.079
What? Where?

26:57.631 --> 26:58.688
I've been looking for you.

26:59.204 --> 27:01.381
31, guy in a car down at the pier.

27:01.416 --> 27:02.521
Okay. Thanks, Alexx.

27:02.556 --> 27:04.085
I was so bummed about
the case being over,

27:04.120 --> 27:06.920
I never thanked you for pulling me
out of the fire with the purse mix-up.

27:06.955 --> 27:08.249
The case may not be over.

27:08.484 --> 27:09.305
What?

27:09.340 --> 27:10.221
The victim at the pier?

27:10.256 --> 27:11.893
It's Karla Gardner's ex-husband.

27:24.592 --> 27:25.506
Nail file.

27:26.697 --> 27:27.922
Yeah, looks familiar.

27:27.957 --> 27:29.680
Can't say he didn't see it coming.

27:30.064 --> 27:31.768
File went in the cornea,

27:32.032 --> 27:33.506
through the ocular nerve,

27:33.541 --> 27:34.882
lodged in his brain.

27:38.697 --> 27:39.975
Lights out.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.463
He struggled with his assailant.

27:52.498 --> 27:53.796
There's hairs in his hand.

27:53.831 --> 27:55.696
Will you get those to DNA, Ryan?

27:56.448 --> 27:57.367
Alexx?

27:57.402 --> 27:58.714
Go ahead, baby.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.431
I can't do much else till post.

28:16.817 --> 28:18.051
Nice ridge detail.

28:18.086 --> 28:19.912
You called me and now,
you won't let me see him?

28:19.947 --> 28:22.799
My number's still in his phone
and you won't let me see him?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.312
No. No.

28:24.347 --> 28:25.189
Miss Gardner.

28:25.224 --> 28:26.877
My phone is right...

28:27.940 --> 28:30.397
It is probably best
if you don't stay here.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.442
No, you realize that she
has not missed a step.

28:35.351 --> 28:36.919
We don't know that she did it.

28:38.757 --> 28:42.509
My wages started being garnished a
month ago to pay for Phillip's alimony.

28:42.544 --> 28:45.557
That is a thousand less
in "her" account a month,

28:45.592 --> 28:48.196
and what happens when
you let her out of jail?

28:48.431 --> 28:49.608
One step at a time.

28:49.643 --> 28:51.312
Let us just take a look at the evidence.

28:52.033 --> 28:55.946
You know, God, I would love to say
that I have faith in you people,

28:55.981 --> 28:58.778
but you are letting a
woman get away with murder.

28:58.908 --> 29:01.718
Miss Gardner, please,
behind the yellow tape.

29:02.521 --> 29:03.915
Great, okay.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.595
So I'm the criminal again.

29:20.576 --> 29:23.976
Lieutenant Caine, Antonio Cruz.

29:24.011 --> 29:25.849
This is my wife, Dona Marta Cruz.

29:25.884 --> 29:26.921
Mrs. Cruz.

29:26.956 --> 29:30.163
I understand you have a...
a problem with our son?

29:30.540 --> 29:31.428
Yes, General.

29:31.463 --> 29:34.340
Clavo is involved in drug
trafficking and murder.

29:36.721 --> 29:38.275
Marta, would you leave us alone?

29:38.510 --> 29:40.102
This is a conversation for men.

29:40.668 --> 29:42.094
You moving in now, Red?

29:42.970 --> 29:45.283
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.065
Lieutenant.

29:47.991 --> 29:49.922
My son is innocent.

29:54.621 --> 29:55.314
Clavo?

29:55.349 --> 29:57.231
Whatever this guy says is a lie, Papi.

29:57.266 --> 29:58.387
He's setting me up.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.082
General, I have witnesses
to Clavo's crimes.

30:01.593 --> 30:04.810
Hey, big man...

30:05.740 --> 30:07.604
you want some more DNA?

30:07.916 --> 30:08.574
Clavo!

30:09.343 --> 30:10.176
Sit.

30:10.551 --> 30:12.168
Down.

30:16.706 --> 30:19.544
Lieutenant Caine is an American
law enforcement officer.

30:19.545 --> 30:21.486
He should be treated with respect.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.125
Thank you.

30:24.457 --> 30:25.794
My apologies.

30:26.805 --> 30:27.934
The stitches are fresh.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.071
The price one pays for

30:30.107 --> 30:31.343
looking good in public.

30:31.379 --> 30:32.342
Understandable.

30:32.676 --> 30:33.523
- Thank you.
- Sure.

30:36.204 --> 30:38.032
Due to diplomatic immunity,

30:39.801 --> 30:41.554
you know you cannot arrest my son.

30:41.792 --> 30:43.256
Not without your help, General.

30:44.947 --> 30:48.248
Do you really think I'm going to
send our youngest son to prison to

30:48.248 --> 30:49.624
join his brother?

30:50.071 --> 30:51.127
That's up to you.

30:55.088 --> 30:55.940
Yes, it is.

30:57.184 --> 30:58.322
And I've made up my mind.

30:58.328 --> 31:00.550
General, you are protecting a murderer.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.995
I may spoil my children,

31:03.803 --> 31:05.668
but they are my children.

31:09.443 --> 31:11.060
Blood is everything, Lieutenant.

31:11.593 --> 31:12.364
Have a good day.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.631
You never close, dawg?

31:25.325 --> 31:27.299
I guess you're closed now.

31:40.218 --> 31:41.921
And I'm nothing like Ramon.

31:42.338 --> 31:43.544
You're not going to catch me

31:43.545 --> 31:46.226
floating around in international waters.

31:55.575 --> 31:56.271
You looking for me?

31:56.334 --> 31:57.424
Yes, I am.

31:58.330 --> 32:00.751
This is the General's blood.
Let's get that to DNA.

32:00.797 --> 32:02.006
- Sure.
- And while we're at it,

32:02.007 --> 32:05.121
let's lift Michelle Cormier's
file from last year.

32:05.351 --> 32:07.424
That's the dead model.
Clavo's brother killed her.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.794
Or so it would seem.

32:09.382 --> 32:09.873
Okay.

32:10.107 --> 32:11.766
I'll let you know
something as soon as I do.

32:11.797 --> 32:12.466
Thank you.

32:14.442 --> 32:17.233
Horatio, just got word that
Clavo's about to take a trip.

32:17.233 --> 32:20.141
Yes, his parents are attempting
to spirit him out of the country.

32:20.591 --> 32:23.446
Apparently, the mother spearheaded it.
They're going to take a plane, as soon...

32:23.447 --> 32:26.018
Frank, I need to keep them in
the country for a few more hours.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.016
Well, I don't know how we can do that.

32:27.017 --> 32:27.654
Let's detain him.

32:28.037 --> 32:29.565
Well, unless something's
changed, he's...

32:29.566 --> 32:32.111
We cannot prosecute,
but we can arrest, Frank.

32:33.172 --> 32:33.638
All right.

32:33.686 --> 32:34.513
On what charge?

32:35.008 --> 32:36.378
You leave that to me.

32:46.886 --> 32:50.350
Mamacita, it's my father's same
speech. I heard it a thousand times.

32:50.961 --> 32:52.978
Willy, what are you doing?
Get her a mojito, huh?

32:53.917 --> 32:55.213
Somebody in here get me a light!

33:02.545 --> 33:03.258
Gracias.

33:03.779 --> 33:04.418
You're welcome.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.133
Frank, am I crazy,

33:08.148 --> 33:09.545
or is that a Cuban cigar?

33:10.199 --> 33:11.165
Looks like it to me.

33:11.246 --> 33:12.654
Those are still illegal, aren't they?

33:13.141 --> 33:14.100
Damn straight, they are.

33:14.123 --> 33:15.521
I got it from Fidel himself.

33:15.522 --> 33:17.227
Got a caseload of them
down at the dock, huh?

33:17.228 --> 33:18.414
Hmm. Interesting.

33:18.548 --> 33:19.521
You're coming with us.

33:19.843 --> 33:23.201
Yo, dawg. Dawg, you can't
do that to me, huh?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.450
Yes, I can, dawg. It's illegal

33:24.452 --> 33:26.616
to sell or purchase Cuban cigars

33:26.617 --> 33:27.596
on American soil.

33:27.635 --> 33:28.959
Somebody call my father, huh?

33:28.989 --> 33:30.024
Tell him what they're doing to me!

33:30.140 --> 33:33.659
Going to be an international
situation, Caine! International!

33:33.813 --> 33:34.895
Not for long.

33:36.286 --> 33:37.356
Not for long.

33:45.426 --> 33:47.402
How did you do with
those hairs in the car?

33:47.432 --> 33:49.289
Only one strand had a follicular tag,

33:49.290 --> 33:50.746
but it only takes one.

33:51.213 --> 33:52.877
DNA profile's inside.

33:55.296 --> 33:56.084
Thanks, Valera.

33:56.188 --> 33:56.931
Sure.

34:03.265 --> 34:05.370
That's the print from the
nail file in the guy's eye?

34:05.893 --> 34:06.261
Yep.

34:06.495 --> 34:08.059
Our identity thief.

34:09.228 --> 34:12.683
Or, as I refer to her, the one without
radiating fractures to her left femur.

34:13.404 --> 34:14.667
DNA's hers, too.

34:15.525 --> 34:16.358
Surprised?

34:16.581 --> 34:18.393
No. I asked patrol to pick her up.

34:19.594 --> 34:21.277
Monday. Dinner at Joe's Stone Crab.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.020
Delicious.

34:26.279 --> 34:28.523
This is harassment.
I didn't kill the guy.

34:28.969 --> 34:31.547
Murder isn't like electronic theft.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.531
Your DNA...

34:38.197 --> 34:39.346
from your hair...

34:39.938 --> 34:41.659
found clutched in Phillip's hand.

34:44.696 --> 34:46.183
Your fingerprint

34:46.902 --> 34:48.235
on the murder weapon.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.790
Let's be logical.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.694
Why I would kill her ex?

34:56.460 --> 34:58.016
To get one of these.

34:59.247 --> 35:00.617
A Certificate of Death.

35:01.048 --> 35:02.414
You present that to the bank,

35:02.434 --> 35:05.560
they quit garnishing Karla Gardner's
wages. No more alimony payments.

35:05.614 --> 35:08.165
That's $4,000 more a month
for you to write checks with.

35:10.950 --> 35:13.304
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I'm going to tell you the truth.

35:16.965 --> 35:19.865
- My real name is Eve Martinkus.
- Sure, it is.

35:19.865 --> 35:22.509
- Anything you say can and will be...
- I had one vacation here in South beach,

35:22.509 --> 35:25.081
and never wanted to leave,
so I steal identities.

35:25.672 --> 35:28.962
I'll give you the names of 20 girls
I've stolen, but I didn't kill this guy.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.849
So, those are not your
hairs in the victim's hand?

35:30.849 --> 35:32.150
DNA's lying. That's what you're saying?

35:32.248 --> 35:33.835
I don't know, but I didn't kill him.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.016
Fine. You were in the car,

35:35.016 --> 35:36.187
and he killed himself.

35:36.209 --> 35:37.600
I was never in the car.

35:44.451 --> 35:45.078
Calleigh.

35:47.255 --> 35:47.801
What's up?

35:48.039 --> 35:50.157
It's probably nothing, but the hairs--

35:50.174 --> 35:52.943
Valera said she only
found one follicular tag.

35:53.099 --> 35:55.957
A struggle to the death should
produce more than one ripped hair.

35:56.692 --> 35:58.080
Maybe Valera stopped at one.

35:58.977 --> 36:00.758
Or something else is going on.

36:01.769 --> 36:04.021
She's ours for 24 hours.
Let's get into it.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.623
There's no tag on this hair either.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.199
That's a total of 32.

36:20.452 --> 36:21.773
32 out of 34.

36:21.774 --> 36:23.546
It is not possible
to get into a struggle

36:23.546 --> 36:25.875
and only have two hairs
torn out at the root.

36:26.022 --> 36:27.184
No, it isn't.

36:27.601 --> 36:29.929
Meaning Eve's hairs were
planted in the victim's hand.

36:31.699 --> 36:32.875
What's that white stuff?

36:33.350 --> 36:34.502
Adhered to the hair?

36:34.633 --> 36:35.405
I don't know,

36:35.440 --> 36:37.186
but I saw it on some of
the other hairs, too.

36:38.469 --> 36:39.241
Where's Aaron?

36:39.491 --> 36:41.379
Uh, probably on break.

36:41.981 --> 36:42.816
Not anymore.

36:44.429 --> 36:45.417
So, what's the goop?

36:46.143 --> 36:48.614
Something you guys use every day.

36:49.184 --> 36:50.457
More specific, please.

36:50.783 --> 36:51.810
Every once in a while,

36:52.058 --> 36:53.055
when you use a roller,

36:53.819 --> 36:55.065
I pick it out of evidence.

36:55.354 --> 36:56.108
A lint roller?

36:57.634 --> 36:58.673
It's adhesive?

36:58.896 --> 36:59.527
Yeah.

36:59.744 --> 37:01.103
So, whoever got these hairs...

37:01.350 --> 37:02.711
Got them after they were shed.

37:10.246 --> 37:11.637
I'd like to see your car.

37:13.904 --> 37:14.492
Why?

37:15.550 --> 37:16.809
Tell me where it's parked.

37:17.351 --> 37:19.132
Are you still trying to pin this on me?

37:20.214 --> 37:21.834
Tell me or I'll beep the lock.

37:25.806 --> 37:26.678
Convertible.

37:27.008 --> 37:28.880
Makes it easy and explains a lot.

37:41.457 --> 37:44.300
The average human
sheds up to 100 hairs a day.

37:49.066 --> 37:50.301
Here's some adhesive.

38:06.643 --> 38:08.801
I thought if I can put her in prison,

38:09.916 --> 38:11.771
I can get my life back.

38:12.383 --> 38:14.628
And get rid of those
pesky alimony payments?

38:14.699 --> 38:15.483
Yes.

38:16.176 --> 38:18.884
We know how you planted
Eve's hair in his hands,

38:18.893 --> 38:20.670
but how'd you get her nail file?

38:21.094 --> 38:22.170
She taught me how.

38:22.805 --> 38:23.478
Eve?

38:24.111 --> 38:26.487
I just did what she had
done to me-- dumpster diving.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.779
And then what, asked
your husband to meet you,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.144
talk about old times?

38:37.190 --> 38:38.094
Close.

38:38.801 --> 38:40.930
I told him I wanted to
give him an alimony check.

38:41.404 --> 38:42.243
Back payment.

38:43.132 --> 38:44.767
Well, it's about time
you came to your senses.

38:44.777 --> 38:45.632
Do you have the check?

38:46.118 --> 38:46.983
Right here.

38:57.058 --> 38:59.437
You thought you killed
two birds with one stone.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.476
Instead, Karla,

39:01.848 --> 39:03.358
you're going to lose your own life.

39:21.717 --> 39:22.489
Is it almost ready?

39:22.542 --> 39:23.492
The handkerchief?

39:23.979 --> 39:25.195
Getting there.

39:31.694 --> 39:32.939
Horatio found his loophole.

39:33.916 --> 39:34.714
Thanks.

39:40.395 --> 39:40.894
Hey.

39:41.160 --> 39:41.529
Eric.

39:41.707 --> 39:42.544
Check it out.

39:49.958 --> 39:50.985
Nice work.

39:53.232 --> 39:53.916
Lieutenant.

39:54.030 --> 39:54.722
Yes?

39:55.163 --> 39:55.756
Where is he?

39:55.870 --> 39:56.683
Where is our son?

39:56.831 --> 39:58.400
General, Clavo has been arrested

39:58.401 --> 39:59.409
for manslaughter.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.769
That boy's drug overdose?
We've been over this.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.472
I understand. Follow me, please.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.694
So worried about you.

40:10.801 --> 40:12.321
Clavo, get up. We are leaving.

40:12.737 --> 40:15.756
Lieutenant, you'll be hearing
from your State Department.

40:15.759 --> 40:17.721
Actually, that's not going
to be necessary, General.

40:17.721 --> 40:20.250
I would appreciate it if you
and your wife would take a seat.

40:20.596 --> 40:22.692
We'll stand. We have a plane to catch.

40:22.818 --> 40:24.413
You took one of our sons.

40:24.414 --> 40:25.865
You're not going to take another.

40:25.894 --> 40:27.172
It's quite true, ma'am.

40:27.758 --> 40:32.032
Turns out that Clavo
is not your husband's son.

40:36.725 --> 40:40.360
We ran the DNA,
and Clavo and his brother

40:40.508 --> 40:42.274
have two different fathers.

40:59.947 --> 41:01.075
Mama?

41:03.255 --> 41:04.131
Marta...

41:06.057 --> 41:07.980
Tell them this is a mistake.

41:12.026 --> 41:13.237
Antonio...

41:13.866 --> 41:15.456
Oh, my God.

41:18.095 --> 41:20.142
General, under the Vienna Convention,

41:20.142 --> 41:22.426
you are still legally Clavo's father.

41:24.630 --> 41:27.923
But I need to remind you now
you have the power to rescind

41:27.923 --> 41:29.659
his immunity at any time.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.528
Papi, don-don't, don't
let him do this to us.

41:36.656 --> 41:37.393
General...

41:45.314 --> 41:46.370
Rescinded.

41:49.156 --> 41:50.466
Antonio, don't.

41:50.504 --> 41:53.153
I'll have the consulate
draw up the papers.

41:53.324 --> 41:55.242
Don't do this to him. No.

41:57.311 --> 41:58.527
Marta...

43:20.421 --> 43:22.362
Stonemore Hotel, please.
