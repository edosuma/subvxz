00:34.952 --> 00:36.119
[NARRATOR] <i>For over a year,</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:40.874
<i>Julius Caesar has been chasing
Pompey Magnus across the Mediterranean</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:46.046
<i>in a civil war that's threatened
to destroy the Roman Republic.</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:51.510
<i>Now, on a field in Greece,</i>

00:52.678 --> 00:57.057
<i>Caesar, Mark Antony, and 22,000 soldiers</i>

00:57.891 --> 01:01.311
<i>face off against Pompey, Brutus,</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:05.147
<i>and their army of 45,000.</i>

01:32.134 --> 01:33.927
Everything we've accomplished

01:34.970 --> 01:36.513
has led us to this moment.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.183
We've been outnumbered before,

01:41.560 --> 01:42.978
but it has never stopped us.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.024
We've fought for glory,

01:47.482 --> 01:48.400
but today...

01:49.526 --> 01:51.028
we fight for honor.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.487
Today,

01:54.239 --> 01:56.283
we show them who we are.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.969
Caesar and Pompey are Rome's
two greatest generals.

02:17.262 --> 02:21.099
And it's really a question as to whether
the old master, Pompey,

02:21.183 --> 02:26.104
is going to be upstaged
by the young rising star, Caesar.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.816
[SOLDIER] <i>First ranks, charge!</i>

02:35.656 --> 02:36.531
[ANTONY] <i>Listen up!</i>

02:37.157 --> 02:38.033
This is it!

02:42.204 --> 02:43.330
Charge!

03:07.562 --> 03:09.940
[NARRATOR]
<i>Caesar's men hold their position.</i>

03:12.275 --> 03:14.069
Maintain formation!

03:17.155 --> 03:19.616
[NARRATOR]
<i>But Pompey has a secret weapon...</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:23.120
<i>a cavalry with 7,000 men.</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:26.581
Pompey is hoping

03:26.665 --> 03:30.544
that his magnificent cavalry outdoes
any cavalry that Caesar has.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.005
He's hoping that the cavalry can
win the day on the battlefield.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.384
Cavalry.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.428
Second ranks, to arms!

03:39.845 --> 03:41.221
[HORN BLOWS]

04:00.907 --> 04:04.161
[NARRATOR] <i>But Caesar is one step ahead
of Pompey.</i>

04:06.037 --> 04:10.041
Caesar comes up with a really clever
counter to Pompey's cavalry.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.588
He holds some of his infantry men
in reserve,

04:14.880 --> 04:18.216
and he pivots them like a swinging door

04:19.301 --> 04:20.969
in the way of Pompey's cavalry,

04:21.052 --> 04:23.221
and they break the charge
of Pompey's cavalry.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.974
[CAESAR] Send the reinforcements!

04:48.705 --> 04:51.333
[STRAUSS] Pompey's cavalry
do not recover from this,

04:51.875 --> 04:56.004
and that's pretty much the end
of Pompey's offensive in this battle.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.341
And now,
the initiative goes over to Caesar.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.301
Push forward!

05:07.098 --> 05:09.768
One of the big advantages that Caesar had

05:09.851 --> 05:13.939
was leading the same legions
that had just helped him conquer Gaul.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.818
They were well-trained,
they were well-disciplined.

05:18.777 --> 05:23.114
These guys were not just battle hardened,
they had been together with each other.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.710
[NARRATOR] <i>After just an hour of fighting,</i>

05:37.838 --> 05:39.214
<i>Pompey retreats.</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:44.094
<i>Caesar claims victory,</i>

05:46.012 --> 05:48.390
<i>killing 15,000 of Pompey's men,</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:54.062
<i>and taking another 20,000 as prisoners.</i>

05:56.523 --> 06:00.443
[TONER] After the battle,
Caesar catches the rest of the senators

06:00.777 --> 06:02.487
and now he has what he wants.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.116
He has ultimate control of Roman politics.

06:19.838 --> 06:20.797
Where is he?

06:22.966 --> 06:23.967
Where is he?

06:27.596 --> 06:28.471
Where's Pompey?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.141
We've searched every tent.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.268
He must have fled.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.901
Caesar gave one very clear instruction
to his men,

06:41.276 --> 06:44.362
and that was that should any of them
see Brutus on the battlefield,

06:44.487 --> 06:45.864
they were not to kill him.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.122
Part of the reason why he was so concerned
for Brutus

06:54.205 --> 06:57.208
might surely be that he was concerned
for Servilia as well,

06:57.292 --> 06:58.835
looking out for her interests.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.005
But another part might be that he was
genuinely concerned for Brutus

07:02.130 --> 07:04.925
that he wanted Brutus to side with him.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.679
[NARRATOR] <i>Caesar has won
the Battle of Pharsalus,</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:13.016
<i>but he knows he won't have control of Rome</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:15.810
<i>until Pompey is killed.</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:47.861
<i>Julius Caesar's victory in Greece
will not be complete</i>

08:48.445 --> 08:51.990
<i>until he captures his archrival, Pompey.</i>

08:55.452 --> 08:57.871
[BRENNAN] As long as he remained alive,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.541
Pompey, even a hobbled Pompey
without much of an army,

09:02.542 --> 09:03.585
was a threat.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.300
One of his men says
he was headed towards Cyprus.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.968
Another claims he's gone to Africa.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.264
I suggest we split our forces.
We can each take a legion...

09:16.347 --> 09:17.515
You're not going.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.100
I need you in Rome.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.186
For what?

09:22.312 --> 09:24.147
I need someone there to maintain order.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.151
There are plenty of men more capable.
I can better serve you here.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.154
You're the only one I can trust.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.574
Take whatever men you need.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.202
What about Pompey?

09:38.661 --> 09:41.873
Knowing him, he'll attempt
to raise an army in the east.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.168
That's where he won his conquests.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.003
They'll remember him there.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.630
In Judea?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.383
Alexandria.

09:59.808 --> 10:05.980
[NARRATOR] <i>Alexandria is a port city
a thousand miles east of Rome, in Egypt,</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:09.192
<i>one of the strongest empires in the world.</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:16.241
Egyptian civilization was extremely old.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.536
It had been there for thousands of years,
back to the pharaohs.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.705
The Romans were the new kids on the block.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.669
[NARRATOR] <i>For centuries,</i>

10:27.752 --> 10:31.506
<i>this ancient power has been one of Rome's
closest allies.</i>

10:34.425 --> 10:41.015
Egypt was one of the richest regions
in the entire Mediterranean world.

10:41.933 --> 10:46.187
They had always been shipping money,
grain, and gold to Rome.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.289
[NARRATOR] <i>Pompey has a long history
with Egypt,</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:07.375
<i>and hopes to use it to defeat Caesar.</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:12.714
A few years previously,
Pompey had loaned

11:12.797 --> 11:17.218
significant amounts of money
to the Egyptian Crown.

11:17.302 --> 11:21.347
This was why Pompey had fled to Egypt
in the first place.

11:21.723 --> 11:25.226
He knew that the Egyptian throne
still owed him that money,

11:25.310 --> 11:28.688
and he planned on using that debt
as leverage

11:28.938 --> 11:32.734
to get the Egyptians to support him
against Caesar.

11:36.279 --> 11:40.408
[NARRATOR] <i>This massive kingdom is ruled
by a fourteen-year-old boy</i>

11:41.618 --> 11:42.827
<i>named Ptolemy.</i>

11:45.371 --> 11:46.998
[STRAUSS] Ptolemy was a boy king

11:47.290 --> 11:50.293
who had been left the crown by his father
in his will.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.047
It was quite usual in Egyptian society

11:54.339 --> 11:57.383
for a king to come to the throne
at a very early age.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.037
It's an honor to finally meet you,
Your Highness.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.707
My name is Pompey Magnus.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.125
I know who you are.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.795
What do you want?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.549
As I'm sure you are aware,

12:38.633 --> 12:42.011
Rome is at war with a small,
but well-trained army of rebels.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.266
I've come here on behalf of the people
of Rome to ask for your support.

12:51.980 --> 12:52.814
How can I help?

12:53.731 --> 12:54.649
As we speak,

12:55.191 --> 12:57.777
I am raising new legions across Africa.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.073
But to ensure a swift
and decisive victory,

13:02.991 --> 13:06.327
I ask you that you pledge your armies
to fight on the side of Rome.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.413
To defeat a small band of rebels?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.164
We could use all the allies we have.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.001
We've drawn the rebels out of Italy,

13:13.751 --> 13:18.006
and concentrated their forces in an area
where it will be easier for us to attack.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.091
I'm impressed.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.386
But my regent tells me
that you've just suffered

13:23.469 --> 13:25.847
a devastating loss to Caesar in Greece.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.144
A minor setback.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.317
The Great Pompey Magnus,

13:38.443 --> 13:40.111
Conqueror of the East,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.613
Defeater of Spartacus...

13:43.781 --> 13:46.117
bowing down and begging for help.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.460
I know you're dealing with your own war.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.338
But we cannot let Rome fall.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.718
Once I defeat Caesar with your help,
I will return with my armies.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.521
[NARRATOR] <i>If Pompey gets the support
of King Ptolemy,</i>

14:16.481 --> 14:19.025
<i>he'll gain the upper hand against Caesar</i>

14:20.234 --> 14:22.820
<i>and threaten to take down
the Roman Republic.</i>

14:26.032 --> 14:29.285
Egypt was an enormous source of anxiety,

14:29.786 --> 14:32.747
because Egypt played
a very important role

14:32.830 --> 14:34.415
in Rome's own food supply.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.377
By choking off the port of Alexandria,

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
you could pretty much bring Rome
to its knees,

14:39.754 --> 14:41.339
so there was a lot of anxiety

14:41.422 --> 14:45.676
about having Pompey or any person of power
ensconced in Egypt.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.020
[NARRATOR] <i>To add to the instability
in Egypt,</i>

14:56.813 --> 15:00.274
<i>Ptolemy is already in the throes
of his own civil war.</i>

15:01.859 --> 15:03.653
When Ptolemy's father had died

15:03.736 --> 15:06.697
he had actually appointed Ptolemy
as co-king

15:06.906 --> 15:10.535
with his sister and the two of them
had actually married,

15:11.244 --> 15:14.831
something which was perfectly normal
in Egyptian society.

15:15.832 --> 15:20.878
But the two of them had fallen out
and Ptolemy had been left as sole regent.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.964
And she had gone into hiding.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.723
[NARRATOR] <i>Caesar realizes how
unpredictable things are in Egypt.</i>

15:33.558 --> 15:34.976
<i>And for all he knows,</i>

15:36.060 --> 15:38.396
<i>he could be heading directly into a trap.</i>

16:01.627 --> 16:03.254
Your Highness.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.134
If you're here to ask for my armies...

16:08.926 --> 16:09.886
you're too late.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.538
You look disappointed?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.416
Cover it up.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.712
Cover it up!

16:49.217 --> 16:50.510
[STRAUSS] Ptolemy kills Pompey

16:50.885 --> 16:54.388
and has his head presented to Caesar
when he arrives in Egypt,

16:55.056 --> 16:58.893
hoping, I think, that it would somehow
ingratiate himself with Caesar.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.937
But, in fact, Caesar is horrified.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.689
He's outraged that the great Roman general

17:03.981 --> 17:06.608
and indeed someone who had been
a relative of his

17:06.692 --> 17:09.403
suffers such a undignified fate.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.155
Why?

17:11.571 --> 17:14.909
Since you're no longer at war,
you can help me fight mine.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.578
Now, we're allies.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.082
I need to get back to Rome.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.625
You owe me.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.422
Once things get settled in Rome,

17:29.632 --> 17:30.967
I'll do all I can.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.476
It wasn't a request.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.021
Keep him here until he changes his mind.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.379
[NARRATOR] <i>After two years chasing Pompey
across Italy and Greece,</i>

18:08.921 --> 18:11.632
<i>Julius Caesar is put under house arrest</i>

18:12.466 --> 18:14.260
<i>as he awaits his fate.</i>

18:17.054 --> 18:20.224
Once Caesar found himself in Egypt,

18:20.308 --> 18:26.522
he became ensconced in a situation
of extraordinary civil unrest.

18:27.023 --> 18:31.027
Caesar himself essentially
became a prisoner in the city.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.081
I apologize about all this.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.585
Then let me go.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.343
I suggest you do as the Emperor requests.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.219
Lend him your armies,

18:57.595 --> 19:00.556
help him end this rebellion
against his sister.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.141
Let me talk to both of them.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.936
I'm sure I can resolve this whole thing...

19:06.854 --> 19:08.356
without any bloodshed.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.693
King Ptolemy isn't interested
in negotiating.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.281
Is that him talking, or you?

19:20.534 --> 19:24.038
You should make yourself comfortable.
You could be here a while.

19:30.378 --> 19:35.549
Caesar arrives in Egypt and underestimates
what the Egyptian reaction will be.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.303
He finds himself holed up in Alexandria,

19:39.470 --> 19:41.305
unable to do anything.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.739
[NARRATOR] <i>As Caesar weighs his decision
to support King Ptolemy,</i>

20:01.325 --> 20:05.079
<i>his newly won republic is spiraling
into chaos.</i>

20:06.247 --> 20:09.250
<i>Since Pompey and the senators
evacuated Rome,</i>

20:10.042 --> 20:12.753
<i>the city has been without
a functioning government.</i>

20:13.337 --> 20:16.340
<i>The biggest problem is the lack of food.</i>

20:19.760 --> 20:23.431
The city of Rome by this point had
a population well over a million people.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.058
It required regular grain shipments

20:26.142 --> 20:28.978
from Sicily, from Egypt,
from other parts of the empire.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.981
The city simply could not sustain itself.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.943
And with no administrative apparatus,
with nobody in charge,

20:36.026 --> 20:38.320
the city was literally
eating itself alive.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.075
[NARRATOR] <i>While grain is still being
delivered to the city,</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:46.287
<i>it's no longer making it to the people,</i>

20:47.371 --> 20:49.582
<i>creating a firestorm.</i>

20:57.256 --> 21:01.343
<i>The man charged with maintaining order
is Mark Antony,</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:03.512
<i>a valiant soldier,</i>

21:04.513 --> 21:07.016
<i>but someone with no political ambitions.</i>

21:08.642 --> 21:11.729
[DUNCAN] Mark Antony did not seem
to have a care in the world.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.356
He liked drinking, he liked gambling,
he liked women.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.110
And the Roman Republic was being run
quite badly.

21:20.863 --> 21:21.697
Sir...

21:22.615 --> 21:23.991
Another riot's broken out.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.452
Shipments are coming.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.454
Tell them to be patient.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.040
We have to do something.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.917
Break it up.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.544
Use force if necessary.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.630
- Sir...
- Do it.

21:45.471 --> 21:49.975
Mark Antony turns out to be a bad choice
to govern Rome in Caesar's absence.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.521
He's not able to deal with popular unrest.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.482
He's forced to resort
to the blunt instrument

21:56.565 --> 21:58.609
of sending troops into the Forum.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.908
[NARRATOR] <i>Under Mark Antony's command,</i>

22:06.325 --> 22:08.244

22:08.953 --> 22:11.121
<i>including women and children.</i>

22:12.164 --> 22:17.002
<i>Proving Rome needs a leader like Caesar
now, more than ever.</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:47.575
<i>As Rome slides into turmoil,</i>

22:48.492 --> 22:51.036
<i>Caesar's refusal to support King Ptolemy</i>

22:51.829 --> 22:53.247
<i>is becoming unsafe.</i>

23:29.450 --> 23:31.076
How long till the guards change?

23:33.996 --> 23:34.872
Who are you?

23:40.711 --> 23:41.795
Cleopatra.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.468
You refused to help my brother.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.011
Why?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.472
Why does it matter?

23:52.932 --> 23:53.933
I need to know.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.187
I didn't want to get involved.

24:03.108 --> 24:03.984
And now?

24:06.403 --> 24:07.446
I still don't.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.867
Even if I got you out of here?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.373
If I say no,

24:18.540 --> 24:20.292
I assume your guards will kill me?

24:20.876 --> 24:21.961
Probably.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
Then I don't have much of a choice then,
do I?

24:30.886 --> 24:33.180
Cleopatra was an intellectual.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.432
She was ambitious and she was driven.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.102
She desired power above all things,

24:38.185 --> 24:42.731
and through aligning herself with Caesar,
Cleopatra had everything to gain.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.238
[NARRATOR] <i>By freeing Caesar,</i>

24:49.697 --> 24:52.282
<i>Cleopatra hopes to strengthen her position</i>

24:53.033 --> 24:55.953
<i>in the war against her brother,
King Ptolemy.</i>

24:57.413 --> 24:59.289
[STRAUSS] Cleopatra has lost out

24:59.957 --> 25:02.668
in the power struggles
in the royal family.

25:03.252 --> 25:07.047
But she finds a way to power,
and that way is called Julius Caesar.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.928
[NARRATOR] <i>Caesar backs the young queen,</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:16.390
<i>believing it will help him
and the Republic.</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:22.146
[STRAUSS] There was something
in this relationship for each party.

25:22.479 --> 25:29.153
Caesar became convinced that Cleopatra
was a sure bet for stability in Egypt.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.742
Cleopatra, of course,
saw Caesar and his legionaries

25:34.825 --> 25:37.745
as her only road to power in Egypt.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.669
[NARRATOR] <i>Caesar sends for reinforcements
in Greece and Italy,</i>

25:46.462 --> 25:49.048
<i>and combined with Cleopatra's own troops</i>

25:49.631 --> 25:52.176
<i>devises a plan to defeat the king.</i>

26:04.146 --> 26:06.023
<i>In 47 B.C.,</i>

26:06.982 --> 26:10.319
<i>Caesar and Cleopatra's army of 20,000 men</i>

26:11.070 --> 26:12.821

26:48.190 --> 26:50.818
<i>King Ptolemy's forces are defeated.</i>

26:52.528 --> 26:53.737
<i>While escaping the city,</i>

26:54.780 --> 26:56.782
<i>Ptolemy drowns in the Nile...</i>

26:59.034 --> 27:02.121
<i>and Cleopatra takes full control
of the kingdom.</i>

27:08.252 --> 27:10.546
<i>Caesar can now return to Rome,</i>

27:11.880 --> 27:15.801
<i>but his alliance with Cleopatra
has become more than political.</i>

27:18.053 --> 27:23.725
Cleopatra impresses Caesar with both
her political skills and her beauty.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.436
They quickly become allies and lovers.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.982
She was exactly the kind of woman
who would appeal

27:30.232 --> 27:33.110
to a man as brilliant as Julius Caesar.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.259
[NARRATOR]
<i>While Caesar enjoys his new role in Egypt,</i>

27:57.759 --> 28:01.263
<i>the troubles back home continue
to escalate.</i>

28:29.333 --> 28:31.126
Riots are breaking out in Rome.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.755
Antony's lost control of the situation.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.507
Then replace him.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.219
I have to get back.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.889
To tend to your duties
as a glorified senator?

28:44.681 --> 28:45.807
I'll be consul.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.768
A chairman for the Senate?

28:51.563 --> 28:52.940
If that's what you want, then go.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.486
But if you're looking for real power,
you won't find it in Rome.

29:01.823 --> 29:02.783
Stay with me

29:03.325 --> 29:05.953
and we'll will rule Egypt together
as King and Queen.

29:08.372 --> 29:11.917
Why are you so determined
to keep me out of Rome?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.669
- I'm not.
- I think you are.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.546
And I think you have been this whole time.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.547
Why would I?

29:19.049 --> 29:20.467
To weaken Rome?

29:21.551 --> 29:23.470
Hold onto power? You tell me.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.639
What exactly are you accusing me of?

29:25.722 --> 29:27.224
I know when I'm being used.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.977
So now I'm using you?

29:30.143 --> 29:30.978
Aren't you?

29:39.861 --> 29:42.531
[STRAUSS] Caesar ultimately
has to return to Rome

29:42.614 --> 29:45.617
because that's where the government is,
that's where the power is.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.079
Caesar has to arrange Roman politics,

29:50.122 --> 29:53.917
but you can't settle Roman politics
without going to Rome.

30:06.847 --> 30:10.559
[NARRATOR] <i>It's been 12 years since Caesar
was forced out of Rome.</i>

30:13.353 --> 30:15.147
<i>Now, he's heading home</i>

30:16.523 --> 30:19.776
<i>to save the city that's fallen into chaos.</i>

30:22.154 --> 30:25.073
Caesar needs to win back
the people to his side

30:25.157 --> 30:28.368
who may have become disgruntled
after being treated

30:28.452 --> 30:31.038
in such a heavy-handed way
by Mark Antony.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.754
Get out.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.895
I trusted you to maintain order.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.271
And I did.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.566
If you did,
the people wouldn't be protesting.

31:41.650 --> 31:45.404
They're protesting because your war
left them without a Senate.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.406
How could you bring my army into Rome?

31:47.489 --> 31:48.615
People were rioting.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.410
- Because they were hungry.
- You told me to maintain order.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.120
- What was I supposed to do?
- Feed them!

31:53.203 --> 31:54.287
I broke up the riots.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.374
- You killed women and children.
- I did what you told me to do.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.708
I would have helped them!

32:02.170 --> 32:03.880
Then maybe you should have been here.

32:04.756 --> 32:05.590
Not in Egypt.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.426
Here.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.137
I should have been here.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.474
But don't blame me for what you did.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.734
[NARRATOR] <i>To save Rome from collapsing,</i>

32:25.944 --> 32:28.280
<i>Caesar will have to rebuild
the government.</i>

32:38.039 --> 32:41.918
<i>He calls a meeting with all the senators
who sided with Pompey</i>

32:43.003 --> 32:44.963
<i>to determine their fate.</i>

33:08.278 --> 33:10.697
You had the power to end this war.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.243
And you did nothing.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.874
And that makes you guilty.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.503
All of you.

33:28.465 --> 33:31.176
Roman blood is on your hands.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.807
You stood by...

33:39.601 --> 33:41.353
and let one of your own

33:42.854 --> 33:45.607
become consumed by greed and power.

33:47.901 --> 33:48.735
Why?

33:50.403 --> 33:51.238
Fear?

33:53.740 --> 33:55.367
Fear of retribution?

33:59.120 --> 34:02.415
This Republic cannot function
without a Senate.

34:05.043 --> 34:10.297
And clearly, this Senate cannot function
under fear of retribution.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.688
Let this serve as an example.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.944
There will be no vengeance.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.157
You may take your seats.

34:42.371 --> 34:46.501
Caesar decided, for his part,
to have a program of clemency;

34:46.710 --> 34:48.335
he was going to forgive people

34:48.420 --> 34:50.589
and incorporate them
within his own circle.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.632
In so doing, he could strengthen his hand,

34:53.842 --> 34:57.512
because he could bring to his side
some of the noble Romans,

34:57.596 --> 35:00.515
so it would make his cause
look all the better again.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.353
[NARRATOR] <i>But Caesar's forgiveness</i>

35:05.770 --> 35:07.814
<i>doesn't come without a price.</i>

35:10.108 --> 35:11.943
For more than four centuries,

35:12.694 --> 35:15.488
the Senate has guided Rome
through times of prosperity,

35:16.114 --> 35:17.532
and times of struggle.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.035
Now is a time to rebuild.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.121
We can earn back the trust of the people,

35:23.204 --> 35:25.707
but it will take time,
and it will take effort.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.961
It is with Rome's interests in mind
that I hereby...

35:31.379 --> 35:33.506
nominate Julius Caesar...

35:34.549 --> 35:36.801
to serve as dictator

35:37.802 --> 35:39.846
for the next ten years...

35:42.557 --> 35:45.226
to help guide us back to a path of honor,

35:46.227 --> 35:49.898
and lead Rome to the great future
it deserves.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.240
I graciously accept this honor,

36:00.950 --> 36:03.953
and the enormous responsibility
that comes with it...

36:06.247 --> 36:08.249
should the nomination be confirmed.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.337
All those in favor?

36:20.178 --> 36:24.641
Caesar resurrects an office
that had really fallen into disuse,

36:24.724 --> 36:26.393
which is the dictatorship.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.856
This is one man,
for a limited amount of time,

36:32.023 --> 36:34.401
holds absolute sole authority.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.322
[BRENNAN] The dictator was...
Started off life

36:39.406 --> 36:42.409
as an emergency office only to be held
for six months.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.081
It was almost a primeval feature
of the Roman republican constitution.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.126
Caesar held this office,
not for a military emergency,

36:51.209 --> 36:53.086
but for reconstituting the Roman state.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.257
To put it back together in such a way

36:57.340 --> 37:01.344
that he would have
an unassailable position at the very top,

37:01.428 --> 37:02.846
and this was extremely un-Roman.

37:05.724 --> 37:09.477
It was a real slap in the face
not just to the Senate,

37:09.561 --> 37:12.063
but to the entire idea of the Republic.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.570
The vote is unanimous.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.701
[NARRATOR] <i>By appointing himself dictator
for ten years,</i>

37:25.410 --> 37:28.163
<i>Caesar ignores the rules
of the constitution,</i>

37:29.205 --> 37:31.708
<i>allowing him more time
to fix the Republic.</i>

37:39.007 --> 37:41.551
[DUNCAN] Caesar had a keen sense

37:41.634 --> 37:45.472
of what was working in the Republic,
and what was not working.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.768
Economic inequality.
The Senate was filled with corruption.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.437
The calendar had completely fallen
out of whack,

37:52.520 --> 37:56.941
their ability to keep time had even
fallen into a deplorable state.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.654
Caesar, he could see all of it,
he could see what needed to be done.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.782
Him assuming dictatorial power

38:03.948 --> 38:06.576
allowed him to make reforms

38:06.659 --> 38:09.913
that had not been able
to be carried forth.

38:12.749 --> 38:16.419
[NARRATOR] <i>Caesar's first order
of business is to feed a population</i>

38:16.544 --> 38:18.421
<i>that's on the brink of starvation.</i>

38:19.589 --> 38:24.385
<i>So he creates a new distribution system
that delivers grain to the people.</i>

38:25.762 --> 38:27.972
<i>And he puts on a series of games,</i>

38:28.515 --> 38:31.100
<i>where gladiators fight to the death.</i>

38:32.477 --> 38:35.146
[IRVIN] The gladiatorial games
that Caesar celebrated

38:35.230 --> 38:39.901
was on a massive scale that the Romans had
only seen a couple of times previously.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.278
But it was really Julius Caesar himself

38:42.570 --> 38:46.115
who had perfected the use
of gladiator contests

38:46.199 --> 38:49.285
as a way of mobilizing popular opinion.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.040
[NARRATOR] <i>These reforms bring stability
back to Rome</i>

38:54.958 --> 38:57.627
<i>and earn Caesar the love of the people,</i>

38:58.545 --> 39:01.381
<i>something he's desired his entire career.</i>

39:04.968 --> 39:07.720
Cesar wanted the support
of the Roman people.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.932
He wanted to be seen
as a legitimate ruler.

39:11.307 --> 39:15.228
He didn't want to be seen
as a simple military tyrant.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.818
[NARRATOR] <i>While Caesar puts himself
above the Senate,</i>

39:23.403 --> 39:26.072
<i>he still needs them to execute his orders.</i>

39:29.033 --> 39:34.956
<i>So he invites many of the younger nobles,
like Brutus, to help draft his policies.</i>

39:36.374 --> 39:39.919
[STRAUSS] Caesar is particularly eager
to bring Brutus to his side.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.840
For one thing, of course,
Brutus is the son of Caesar's

39:44.007 --> 39:46.593
longtime mistress, Servilia.

39:47.343 --> 39:52.098
But the other thing is that Brutus
in some sense is Mr. Rome.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.643
Brutus, as the man who has the ancestry

39:55.727 --> 39:59.063
and a man who is universally respected
by the Roman people,

39:59.147 --> 40:02.984
having Brutus on your side
is a very valuable card to play,

40:03.192 --> 40:04.986
and Caesar wants to play it to the full.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.991
The Republic's changing.
We need to change with it.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.827
That's something Pompey never accepted.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.333
And yet you sided with him and not me.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.251
Why?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.006
He had a larger army.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.300
More experience.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.885
The support of the Senate.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.013
And I didn't think you could win.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.481
Honesty is very hard to come by.

40:43.316 --> 40:44.484
Especially in the Senate.

40:48.571 --> 40:51.824
There are very few who understand
what needs to be done,

40:51.908 --> 40:54.160
and even fewer who I trust.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.124
I want you...

41:01.167 --> 41:04.295
to oversee affairs here and in Gaul,

41:05.880 --> 41:09.592
make sure the local magistrates
are implementing the new laws.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.179
And of course you'll need some authority,

41:14.555 --> 41:16.724
so I'll be appointing you governor.

41:18.643 --> 41:19.560
That's quite an honor.

41:20.645 --> 41:21.688
Then it's settled.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.899
It's just I don't think I'm eligible.
I haven't held high enough office.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.985
I'll make sure the Senate approves
your appointment.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.663
Caesar had given Brutus
some preferential treatment.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.374
No doubt regard for Servilia,
his mistress...

41:41.958 --> 41:44.085
Even though their affair
seems to have ended,

41:44.377 --> 41:47.005
they still had a strong friendship
which lasted a long time.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.187
You look well.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.366
Aren't you going to offer me any wine?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.118
Yes, of course.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.502
How was Egypt?

42:28.463 --> 42:29.380
Memorable?

42:31.466 --> 42:33.551
I'm sure the pyramids were breathtaking.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.026
It's good to see you.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.863
I just wanted to say thank you.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.324
For what?

42:57.366 --> 42:59.368
Sparing Brutus's life.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.755
