00:20.173 --> 00:22.040
Listen, pep talk.

00:22.108 --> 00:25.210
Big day today.
It's our grand
re-re-re-opening.

00:25.278 --> 00:27.279
It's labor day weekend,

00:27.347 --> 00:28.580
And it looks like
wonder wharf is getting
mobbed. So we have to--

00:28.648 --> 00:31.016
Big day for
another reason, too!

00:31.084 --> 00:32.884
Linda, I'm in the middle
of my pep talk.

00:32.952 --> 00:34.820
Go ahead, sorry.
Go ahead, do your pep.

00:34.887 --> 00:37.189
So we have to sell
some burgers.

00:37.257 --> 00:38.423
[fart noise]
every year, this weekend

00:38.491 --> 00:40.525
Makes or breaks us.
Who's farting?

00:40.593 --> 00:42.694
It's gene's sound
effects thing.

00:42.762 --> 00:44.263
I thought that made you
sound like a robot.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.231
It does robot voice,
laser sound,

00:46.299 --> 00:47.866
And fart noise.

00:47.934 --> 00:49.334
[fart noise]

00:49.402 --> 00:50.736
Oh, god. Listen,
your mother and I

00:50.803 --> 00:53.005
Have to go downstairs
and grind the meat.

00:53.072 --> 00:55.540
But you kids know where
you're supposed to be
while we're gone, right?

00:55.608 --> 00:56.842
Tina, you're on the grill.

00:56.909 --> 00:58.844
My crotch is itchy.
All: Oh!

00:58.911 --> 01:01.246
Ok. Are you telling me
as my daughter,

01:01.314 --> 01:03.749
Or as my grill cook?
Um, as...

01:03.816 --> 01:06.685
Because my grill cook
would never tell me that.

01:06.753 --> 01:08.353
Oh.
Also, my daughter

01:08.421 --> 01:10.255
Should probably not
say anything like that to me.

01:10.323 --> 01:12.391
Tell her. Tell your mom.
My crotch is itchy.

01:12.458 --> 01:13.825
Come here, let me see.
Linda. Not now.

01:13.893 --> 01:16.662
No, let's all see it.
No.

01:16.729 --> 01:18.664
I'm just not sure
if I'll be any good
on the grill

01:18.731 --> 01:21.400
With just one free hand.

01:21.467 --> 01:23.635
Ok, I'm just going
to keep moving here.

01:23.703 --> 01:25.203
Louise, you're working
the counter.

01:25.271 --> 01:26.938
I put your little
step stool back here.

01:27.006 --> 01:29.474
But do not alter anything
on the chalkboard.

01:29.542 --> 01:31.510
Well, what if I think
of something better?

01:31.577 --> 01:33.278
Which would be almost
impossible not to do.

01:33.346 --> 01:35.280
You will not think
of something better,

01:35.348 --> 01:38.450
Because "new bacon-ings"
is perfect. It's hilarious.

01:38.518 --> 01:41.286
Right? You know what,
I'm taking the chalk.

01:41.354 --> 01:42.888
Like I don't have chalk.

01:42.955 --> 01:44.656
Gene, you're outside,
nicely offering people

01:44.724 --> 01:46.892
A free sample, all right?
I'm on it!

01:46.959 --> 01:48.794
But people coming out
of the crematorium next door;

01:48.861 --> 01:51.496
People obviously in mourning...
Yeah?

01:51.564 --> 01:53.298
Don't offer them samples.

01:53.366 --> 01:55.334
Dad, when I'm in
character out there,

01:55.401 --> 01:57.002
I get in a zone!

01:57.070 --> 01:59.738
I can't keep track of who's
in mourning and who isn't.

01:59.806 --> 02:01.606
Just anyone with an urn...
Yeah?

02:01.674 --> 02:03.408
Leave 'em alone!

02:03.476 --> 02:05.143
I know you think
it's the gene show out there,

02:05.211 --> 02:07.679
But there's a line
between entertaining
and annoying.

02:07.747 --> 02:09.348
No! That's a myth.

02:09.414 --> 02:11.350
[laser sounds]

02:11.417 --> 02:13.585
[fart sounds]

02:17.757 --> 02:20.826
All right, listen.
You're my children
and I love you.

02:20.893 --> 02:24.796
But you're all terrible
at what you do here,

02:24.864 --> 02:26.231
And I feel like
I should tell you,

02:26.299 --> 02:27.999
I'd fire all of you
if I could.
Bob!

02:28.067 --> 02:29.401
All right, hands in.

02:29.469 --> 02:31.002
Don't--tina,
don't put your hand in.

02:31.070 --> 02:33.538
Tina: What...
All right. Sell some burgers!

02:33.606 --> 02:36.241
All, softly:
Sell some burgers.

02:37.293 --> 02:39.361
[crying]

02:39.429 --> 02:41.463
Bob's burgers!

02:41.531 --> 02:42.698
[robot voice] free sample!
[laser noise]

02:42.782 --> 02:46.017
Come and get it.
[fart noise]

02:46.085 --> 02:48.320
[fart noise]
aahh!

02:48.388 --> 02:50.589
I don't like leaving
the kids alone up
there for this long.

02:50.656 --> 02:52.557
Something bad's
gonna happen.

02:52.625 --> 02:53.925
Bob, they're fine.
Please, I asked you
a question.

02:53.993 --> 02:55.761
Yes, what was
the question?

02:55.828 --> 02:57.863
Do you remember
our wedding night?

02:57.930 --> 03:00.766
Yes. We worked
'cause we couldn't
afford not to. I remember.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.968
You know
you're grinding
too fast. Slow down.

03:03.035 --> 03:04.486
What was the date?
The date?

03:04.554 --> 03:05.771
Yes, the date
of our wedding!

03:05.838 --> 03:07.505
I don't know.

03:07.557 --> 03:10.976
Oh, crap.
Is it today?
Yes, bob!

03:11.043 --> 03:12.644
Today's our anniversary.
Yes, it is!

03:12.712 --> 03:13.979
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.

03:14.046 --> 03:16.815
I'm not good with dates,
you know that.

03:16.883 --> 03:19.618
Today's
your birthday?
Yes, bob!

03:19.685 --> 03:22.687
Today's my birthday?
Yes, bob!

03:22.755 --> 03:24.990
Your due date
was today?
Yes, bob!

03:25.057 --> 03:26.591
How'd it go?

03:26.659 --> 03:28.927
How do you think it--
good. It went very well.

03:28.995 --> 03:30.729
That's good.

03:30.797 --> 03:32.564
Boy or girl?

03:32.632 --> 03:34.399
Where you going?
I'm done!

03:34.467 --> 03:35.567
I said I'm sorry.

03:35.635 --> 03:37.469
Bob, I'm done!

03:37.537 --> 03:39.971
Linda, come back.
We need to finish
grinding the hamburger.

03:40.039 --> 03:42.073
Man: Oh, my god, gross.

03:42.141 --> 03:43.708
Thank you.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.876
[robot voice]
free samples.

03:44.944 --> 03:46.711
Hey, you can't give out
those samples.

03:46.779 --> 03:48.480
You just dropped them
on the ground.

03:48.548 --> 03:50.916
Shh! What are you,
the dropping food
on the ground police?

03:50.983 --> 03:53.318
Yes.
Oh. They have that?

03:53.386 --> 03:55.954
Yes. I'm the health inspector.
The what?

03:56.022 --> 03:57.422
[robot voice]
health inspector. Off.

03:57.490 --> 03:59.958
What?
Health inspector!

04:00.026 --> 04:03.061
The burger joint's
natural enemy.

04:05.498 --> 04:08.099
Hello. Welcome
to bob's burgers.

04:08.167 --> 04:10.769
The burger of the day
is the child molester.

04:10.837 --> 04:13.338
It comes with candy.
Get it?

04:13.406 --> 04:14.806
Yes.
No.

04:14.874 --> 04:16.374
'cause sometimes
they use candy

04:16.442 --> 04:17.875
To lure their victims--

04:17.944 --> 04:19.611
Yes, we get it.
Ohh.

04:19.678 --> 04:21.046
Is this
your parents' place?

04:21.113 --> 04:22.514
Yes, they're down
in the basement

04:22.582 --> 04:24.316
Grinding the meat right now.
Uh-huh.

04:24.383 --> 04:25.817
That's not a euphemism.

04:25.885 --> 04:27.686
They're really grinding
the meat.

04:27.753 --> 04:29.621
Show us the kitchen,
please.

04:29.689 --> 04:31.890
I'm just saying,
it's easy to remember
our anniversary.

04:31.958 --> 04:34.125
It's September third. 9/3.

04:34.193 --> 04:35.827
9 is divisible by 3.

04:35.895 --> 04:37.462
What? That's not--

04:37.530 --> 04:39.397
A lot of numbers
are divisible by 3.

04:39.465 --> 04:40.765
Don't argue with me.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.634
All right, you're right,
9 is divisible by 3,

04:42.702 --> 04:44.369
And now
I'll remember.

04:44.437 --> 04:45.871
[gasps] oh, my god.

04:45.938 --> 04:48.507
Are you messing with me?

04:48.574 --> 04:50.509
What? What are you--no.
You are.

04:50.576 --> 04:51.743
I--
you are!

04:51.811 --> 04:53.445
Lin, I forgot.
I am sorry.

04:53.513 --> 04:55.547
I said I'm sorry.
And I'm going to
make it up to you.

04:55.615 --> 04:57.482
I can see you smiling.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.351
I'm not smiling!

04:59.418 --> 05:01.152
You're smiling
with your eyes.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.587
What is it?
What are you doing?

05:02.655 --> 05:03.889
A party?!
Why are you doing this?

05:03.956 --> 05:05.490
Is it a party upstairs?!

05:05.558 --> 05:06.791
No, linda,
can you please
just finish this?

05:06.859 --> 05:08.093
I gotta get
back up there.

05:08.144 --> 05:09.678
Oh! To get everything
ready for the party?

05:09.762 --> 05:11.630
No! To get everything
ready for lunch,

05:11.697 --> 05:14.699
In our restaurant,
the one we're trying
to save, remember?

05:14.767 --> 05:15.934
Go ahead. Go.

05:16.002 --> 05:17.702
Call me to come up
when it's all ready.

05:17.770 --> 05:19.638
I'll act surprised,
like this--

05:19.705 --> 05:20.839
[gasps] ahh!

05:20.907 --> 05:22.407
That's--
ohh!

05:22.475 --> 05:23.642
I almost had
a heart attack!

05:23.709 --> 05:25.076
That's scared,
that's not surprised.

05:25.144 --> 05:27.012
Ahhh!

05:27.079 --> 05:28.747
That's like you hurt yourself.

05:28.814 --> 05:30.749
Ahhh-ahhh!
That's good.

05:30.816 --> 05:33.118
Smell this. Doesn't it
smell like strawberries?

05:33.185 --> 05:34.786
[sniffs] ugh!

05:34.854 --> 05:37.122
Gotcha.
It's spoiled milk, dummy.

05:37.189 --> 05:38.857
So you're
the health inspector?
Yes.

05:38.925 --> 05:41.092
'cause I think
I have some kind of
rash or something.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.628
I'm not that kind
of health inspector.

05:43.696 --> 05:46.197
Rashy grill cook.

05:46.265 --> 05:48.433
[toilet flushes]

05:49.268 --> 05:51.670
You have no idea

05:51.737 --> 05:53.204
What I've just
been through.

05:53.272 --> 05:55.040
Do I have any
toilet paper
stuck to my buns?

05:55.107 --> 05:56.675
[fart noise]

05:56.742 --> 05:57.909
Where are
the grown-ups?!

05:57.977 --> 05:59.744
[door opens]
aha! You must be bob.

05:59.812 --> 06:01.780
Uh, who are you?

06:01.847 --> 06:03.381
We're from the health
inspectors office.

06:03.449 --> 06:04.749
I'm hugo, this is
my partner ron.

06:04.817 --> 06:06.585
I don't have a badge
yet. I just started.

06:06.652 --> 06:07.786
[fart noise]
give me that.

06:07.853 --> 06:09.020
Come on!

06:09.088 --> 06:10.789
Bob, this is
my violations notebook.

06:10.856 --> 06:12.157
I just filled it.

06:12.224 --> 06:13.675
It took 5 minutes
in your kitchen.

06:13.743 --> 06:16.127
Uh, that sounds bad.
It's a record.

06:16.195 --> 06:17.929
[kids cheering]
shut up.

06:17.997 --> 06:19.531
Not to mention
child labor law
violations,

06:19.599 --> 06:21.733
Public decency
violations--

06:21.801 --> 06:23.702
Public decency?
What--what are you
talking about?

06:23.769 --> 06:26.171
The child molester?
I thought this was
a family restaurant.

06:26.238 --> 06:28.673
Uh, what's the child molester?

06:28.741 --> 06:30.542
It's the burger
of the day.
No, it's not.

06:30.610 --> 06:32.010
For a limited time only.

06:32.078 --> 06:33.244
Till you came back
upstairs.

06:33.312 --> 06:34.646
Did someone actually
order this?
Yeah.

06:34.714 --> 06:35.880
Who?
Him.

06:35.948 --> 06:38.016
Huh. He looks like
a child molester.

06:38.084 --> 06:39.484
Louise, don't serve him.
Let gene bring it.

06:39.552 --> 06:40.919
Uh, bob--

06:40.987 --> 06:42.387
Why do I have
to get molested?

06:42.455 --> 06:43.622
Because he's not going
to molest you.
Why?

06:43.689 --> 06:44.923
Because you're heavy.

06:44.991 --> 06:46.157
Bob--
yeah, hold on.

06:46.225 --> 06:47.826
Heavy kids can
get molested!

06:47.893 --> 06:50.362
Yeah, who wouldn't want
to molest this face?

06:50.429 --> 06:51.763
That's enough.
It's not that.
Bob--

06:51.831 --> 06:53.431
I mean, gene,
'cause you're older.

06:53.499 --> 06:55.166
Tina's the oldest.
Make her do it.

06:55.234 --> 06:56.935
Yeah, but tina's not good
with the customers.
Bob--

06:57.003 --> 06:58.203
I'm good with
the customers.

06:58.270 --> 06:59.537
No. No.
Mmm, not really.

06:59.605 --> 07:00.839
I'm great
with the customers.

07:00.906 --> 07:02.374
Mmm.
Mm-mmm.

07:02.441 --> 07:03.742
She's autistic,
she can't help it.

07:03.809 --> 07:05.577
Yeah, I'm autistic.

07:05.645 --> 07:06.778
Bob--
just a sec.

07:06.846 --> 07:08.246
No, you're not autistic, tina.

07:08.314 --> 07:10.548
How many toothpicks
on the ground?

07:10.616 --> 07:12.917
Don't play this game again.
Come on. How many toothpicks?

07:12.985 --> 07:14.986
No. It just involves me
cleaning up toothpicks.

07:15.054 --> 07:16.187
A hundred?
Bob!

07:16.255 --> 07:17.455
No.
A hundred?

07:17.523 --> 07:18.857
It's three!
There's three!

07:18.924 --> 07:20.258
Ok, ok,
how many now?
Bob!

07:20.326 --> 07:22.193
Three.
Both: No!

07:22.261 --> 07:23.928
Ugh, you're the worst
kind of autistic.

07:23.996 --> 07:25.964
You can't
even count.
Bob!

07:26.032 --> 07:27.766
You want to know
why we're here?

07:27.833 --> 07:29.467
Because I'll tell you,
it's not for a routine
inspection.

07:29.535 --> 07:30.835
It's not?
No.

07:30.903 --> 07:32.871
We're investigating
a very disturbing rumor.

07:32.938 --> 07:34.606
There's a rumor
you make your burgers

07:34.674 --> 07:39.744
With human remains
from the crematorium
next door!

07:39.812 --> 07:43.048
Hmm. I wonder how a rumor
like that gets started.

07:43.115 --> 07:44.883
It's made
with human remains

07:44.950 --> 07:46.885
From the crematorium
next door.

07:46.952 --> 07:48.620
[all gasping]

07:48.688 --> 07:50.388
Who knows? Kids
say crazy stuff.

07:50.456 --> 07:51.756
Here's what's
gonna happen.

07:51.824 --> 07:53.158
We'll test your meat.

07:53.225 --> 07:54.659
If it contains
human flesh

07:54.727 --> 07:56.661
Anything above the 4%
allowable by the fda,

07:56.729 --> 07:59.130
Then your restaurant
will be closed,

07:59.198 --> 08:02.067
And you, sir,
will be going to jail.

08:02.134 --> 08:06.037
Oh, a party for me!

08:06.105 --> 08:07.806
Oh. Hugo?
Linda?

08:07.873 --> 08:09.674
What are you doing here?

08:09.742 --> 08:12.010
I'm the health
inspector. I just
transferred here.

08:12.078 --> 08:13.678
[gasps]
what are you doing here?

08:13.746 --> 08:15.246
This is our restaurant.
We own it.

08:15.314 --> 08:17.348
You're married
to him?

08:17.416 --> 08:19.084
How do you two
know each other?

08:19.151 --> 08:20.652
I thought you
ran off with bob,

08:20.720 --> 08:22.187
The hot shot
restaurateur .

08:22.254 --> 08:23.688
I did.

08:23.756 --> 08:25.857
Oh, god.
You did?

08:25.925 --> 08:27.125
I'm on it.

08:27.193 --> 08:29.060
Yeah, I don't think so!

08:29.128 --> 08:31.196
I can't believe--

08:31.263 --> 08:34.164
I can't--

08:34.232 --> 08:36.234
I--

08:36.302 --> 08:39.104
I can't believe
you left me for him!

08:39.171 --> 08:40.304
You left someone for me?

08:40.371 --> 08:42.073
Ugh! He doesn't
even know?

08:42.140 --> 08:43.908
We were--we were
briefly engaged.

08:43.976 --> 08:45.960
[all gasping]

08:46.028 --> 08:48.279
I still remember
the day I heard
you were getting married.

08:48.347 --> 08:49.748
Oh, my god.

08:49.815 --> 08:51.282
Is today
your anniversary?

08:51.350 --> 08:53.718
Yes! How do you remember that?

08:53.786 --> 08:55.053
It's 9-3.

08:55.121 --> 08:56.254
9 is divisible by 3.

08:56.322 --> 08:57.756
That doesn't make sense!

08:57.823 --> 08:59.724
A lot of numbers
are divisible by 3.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.393
Well, happy anniversary.

09:02.461 --> 09:03.895
Human flesh?!

09:03.963 --> 09:05.163
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:05.231 --> 09:06.698
This is one of our
biggest weekends.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.867
You can't put that up.
Nobody will eat here.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.535
Prominently
displayed.

09:10.603 --> 09:12.837
Well, then just do
your tests, pal,
because it's beef.

09:12.905 --> 09:15.073
Sorry! The lab's
closed till Monday.

09:15.141 --> 09:16.674
You'll get your
test results then.

09:16.742 --> 09:19.677
Consider yourself
health inspectored!

09:19.745 --> 09:21.246
[screaming]

09:21.313 --> 09:22.981
I--I'd try it.

09:23.048 --> 09:25.216
There's no wait.

09:27.286 --> 09:29.587
Hello, how are you?
Come in and have a burger.

09:29.655 --> 09:30.789
A perfectly
normal burger.

09:30.856 --> 09:32.157
Best burger in town.

09:32.224 --> 09:33.758
[screaming]

09:33.826 --> 09:35.760
Did your father
say anything

09:35.828 --> 09:38.229
About an anniversary present?
Kids: No.

09:38.297 --> 09:40.148
Nothing? Like maybe
hiding a necklace

09:40.232 --> 09:41.566
In a hamburger,

09:41.634 --> 09:43.768
Or hiding some earrings
down the drain,

09:43.836 --> 09:45.870
Or something
romantic like that?

09:45.938 --> 09:47.205
That's romantic?

09:47.273 --> 09:48.773
Yeah!
Yeah.

09:48.841 --> 09:50.241
Did you check the toilet
or in the garbage?

09:50.309 --> 09:52.010
Ahh.
Gene, get off.

09:52.077 --> 09:53.211
You're choking me.
Whee!

09:53.279 --> 09:55.563
You're choking me!
[screaming]

09:55.631 --> 09:57.565
So is hugo going
to put dad in jail

09:57.633 --> 09:58.900
Because
you dumped him?

09:58.968 --> 10:01.002
No. Hugo is going
to put your father in jail

10:01.070 --> 10:02.337
Because your sister

10:02.404 --> 10:04.572
Told her class
that we serve human flesh.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.958
Now why would you do
something like that, honey?

10:07.026 --> 10:09.727
Why?
I'll tell you
why, mom!

10:09.795 --> 10:12.363
Anita vasquez's uncle
is a matador in Spain.

10:12.431 --> 10:14.265
She was showing
everybody his cape.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.867
I had to up the ante,

10:15.935 --> 10:17.802
And what do I have to
show for show and tell?

10:17.870 --> 10:19.737
I got nothing, mom!
Calm down.

10:19.805 --> 10:21.606
There's nothing
here to show!
Louise...

10:21.674 --> 10:23.708
What?!
Tina, stop.

10:23.776 --> 10:25.076
[screaming]

10:25.144 --> 10:28.213
Mom, you can get hugo
to take down the sign.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.848
How am I supposed
to do that?

10:29.915 --> 10:31.249
He's madly in love
with you.

10:31.317 --> 10:33.084
Work it, woman.
Yeah.

10:33.152 --> 10:34.919
[groans]

10:34.987 --> 10:37.055
[hugo crying]

10:37.122 --> 10:39.290
["never gonna give you up"
playing on cell phone]

10:40.459 --> 10:42.961
Hello?

10:43.028 --> 10:44.596
Linda?!

10:44.663 --> 10:46.831
Bob: It's our
big weekend.

10:46.899 --> 10:49.834
I mean, this grill
should be covered
with burgers right now.

10:49.902 --> 10:51.836
Who's that for?

10:51.904 --> 10:53.538
Mort. He called in
his order. He doesn't
want to be seen here,

10:53.606 --> 10:55.373
So I'm sending gene over
to the crematorium with it.

10:55.441 --> 10:56.808
[bell rings]
right.

10:56.876 --> 10:59.377
So hugo
is coming over.

10:59.445 --> 11:02.013
To talk. To me.
What?

11:02.081 --> 11:03.815
Don't be mad.
I think I can
talk him out of it,

11:03.883 --> 11:05.717
All of this.

11:05.784 --> 11:07.652
And when you say
"talk him out of it,"
what does that mean?

11:07.720 --> 11:09.821
Is hugo going to be
our new dad?

11:09.889 --> 11:12.190
Oh, please.
Just checking.

11:12.258 --> 11:13.424
Maybe I should help you
set the mood.

11:13.492 --> 11:14.926
Put out some candles.

11:14.994 --> 11:16.327
Ooh, candles!

11:16.395 --> 11:17.862
Ugh, unbelievable.

11:17.930 --> 11:20.398
Bob's burgers
delivery service!

11:20.466 --> 11:21.900
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

11:21.967 --> 11:23.935
Quick!

11:24.003 --> 11:25.670
Why'd you ever get engaged
to that guy, anyway?

11:25.738 --> 11:27.872
Ahh, I was young.
And my parents
liked him

11:27.940 --> 11:29.207
Because he always
did the dishes.

11:29.275 --> 11:30.441
Yeah, I bet.

11:30.509 --> 11:32.143
Ha! Also, he--

11:32.211 --> 11:33.778
He used to...

11:33.846 --> 11:35.313
What?

11:35.381 --> 11:38.149
He, uh, he happened to
be an excellent kisser.

11:38.217 --> 11:40.051
What--an excellent kisser?

11:40.119 --> 11:41.686
Yeah. He was
very soft,

11:41.754 --> 11:43.788
And he didn't have
a lot of moisture.

11:43.856 --> 11:45.690
Like some people.
Like some people?

11:45.758 --> 11:47.258
You think I'm a bad kisser?

11:47.326 --> 11:48.459
No...

11:48.527 --> 11:50.161
Oh, yeah,
well, how about this?

11:50.229 --> 11:51.996
Oh--oh.

11:52.064 --> 11:53.464
Are you sweating?

11:53.532 --> 11:55.199
Uh, no.

11:55.267 --> 11:56.634
Is that my saliva?

11:56.702 --> 11:58.336
Don't be mad!

11:58.404 --> 12:00.905
Oh, no, I'm not.
Not at all!
Bob!

12:00.973 --> 12:02.140
I better go, all right?

12:02.207 --> 12:03.975
I'd hate to get
any saliva on you

12:04.043 --> 12:06.177
And mr. Perfect
moisture mouth!

12:06.245 --> 12:09.280
I happen to produce
a lot of saliva, linda!

12:11.116 --> 12:13.918
So! You're
the health
inspector, huh?

12:13.986 --> 12:15.453
How did that happ--
I want to read you this poem.

12:15.521 --> 12:17.221
En.

12:17.289 --> 12:18.423
"inspector of health,

12:18.490 --> 12:20.858
Inspector of pain."
um...

12:20.926 --> 12:23.027
"I came in search
of human remains,

12:23.095 --> 12:25.296
"and I found a piece
of human flesh

12:25.364 --> 12:29.267
I thought I'd never
see again--my heart."

12:29.335 --> 12:31.736
Mm-hmm. Very nice!

12:31.804 --> 12:35.606
Uh, hugo, you know bob's
not a cannibal, right?

12:35.674 --> 12:37.942
I don't know that.
Don't do this.

12:38.010 --> 12:39.277
I'm sorry
I hurt you--

12:39.345 --> 12:43.314
Linda! I can save you
from all this!

12:48.587 --> 12:50.888
Wow. A candy coffin.

12:50.956 --> 12:54.726
Customized caskets
and urns, that's
our specialty.

12:54.793 --> 12:56.160
That's mr. Caffrey

12:56.228 --> 12:58.062
Of the caffrey
toffee company.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.764
It's on the lift
'cause they're coming

12:59.832 --> 13:01.366
To pick 'em up
this afternoon.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.101
I need more
condiments.

13:03.168 --> 13:06.571
Don't touch anything
and don't press
any buttons.

13:15.214 --> 13:18.916
Oh, my god!
It's bob anniversary
present, he remembered!

13:18.984 --> 13:20.535
Aww.

13:20.602 --> 13:24.222
This is so exciting.

13:24.289 --> 13:25.490
It's a dead body!

13:25.557 --> 13:27.258
Maybe
the present's
underneath.

13:27.326 --> 13:29.494
You're on
a sinking ship, lady.

13:29.561 --> 13:32.029
And you better get off
before the ship sinks!

13:32.081 --> 13:33.798
Hello, the media?

13:38.783 --> 13:40.951
[all shouting]

13:43.420 --> 13:46.022
[clapping]

13:46.090 --> 13:48.158
Good job, everybody.

13:48.225 --> 13:49.592
An angry mob,

13:49.660 --> 13:53.296
That's just what we wanted
outside our restaurant.

13:53.364 --> 13:56.366
They're over there,
in their little van,

13:56.434 --> 13:58.434
Inspecting themselves.

13:58.486 --> 14:01.438
[indistinct]

14:01.505 --> 14:03.406
Do you think I should change
where I part my hair?

14:03.474 --> 14:06.209
Uh, let me see.
Uh, yes?

14:06.277 --> 14:08.244
Can you open
the window
a little more?

14:08.312 --> 14:10.213
I'm not going
to assault you.

14:10.281 --> 14:11.798
Don't touch me!
Sorry.

14:11.866 --> 14:13.583
That just
came over me.

14:13.651 --> 14:15.719
Listen, I came out
to ask you to talk
to this crowd.

14:15.786 --> 14:17.721
I mean, you made
an angry mob here.

14:17.788 --> 14:20.056
Huh.
Hey, what's all
this stuff?

14:20.124 --> 14:21.758
You got a whole
chemistry lab
back there.

14:21.826 --> 14:23.226
Can't you do
the test here,

14:23.294 --> 14:24.594
Instead of ruining
my weekend?

14:24.662 --> 14:26.162
Don't tell me how
to do my job.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.530
I don't tell you
how to grow your corpses.

14:27.598 --> 14:28.732
Come here.

14:28.799 --> 14:30.466
Aah! No! Let go of me!

14:30.518 --> 14:33.269
Good luck with
the angry mob, bob!

14:33.337 --> 14:37.173
Uh, how close am I to that car?

14:37.241 --> 14:39.009
You want me to help you
get out of your spot?

14:39.076 --> 14:41.811
Yeah! I can't
see his bumper?
Am I close?

14:41.879 --> 14:43.580
No, you got room.

14:43.647 --> 14:47.117
Keep coming.
Keep coming. Stop.

14:47.184 --> 14:50.020
How am I doing in front?
It's tight.

14:50.087 --> 14:51.454
Keep comin'.

14:51.522 --> 14:52.789
All right, cut the wheel.

14:52.857 --> 14:55.225
Cut the wheel!
I am, I am, I'm cutting it.

14:55.292 --> 14:57.060
You gotta cut hard
right when you--

14:57.128 --> 14:59.362
Just get out, I'll do it.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.667
Oh, my god.

15:04.735 --> 15:06.703
Bob's confronting the crowd.
I'm going out there.

15:06.771 --> 15:08.872
You kids stay inside.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.340
Hey, people!

15:10.408 --> 15:11.808
This is crazy.

15:11.876 --> 15:14.711
We're being smeared
by an unstable
health inspector

15:14.779 --> 15:17.714
For personal reasons.

15:17.782 --> 15:19.749
We know you people,
and you know us.

15:19.817 --> 15:22.252
You, you're
the shoe repair guy.

15:22.319 --> 15:23.586
Nope. Locksmith.

15:23.654 --> 15:25.188
I mean the locksmith,
the locksmith.

15:25.256 --> 15:27.857
I had keys made by you.
So?

15:27.925 --> 15:30.193
That was...Great, right?

15:30.261 --> 15:31.628
Hmm. Fair.

15:31.695 --> 15:32.896
All: Boo!

15:32.963 --> 15:34.664
No, no, no booing.

15:34.732 --> 15:36.833
No booing mort.
You know him, too.

15:36.901 --> 15:38.301
He's one of us.

15:38.369 --> 15:39.803
This guy has been
here forever.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.438
Ever since I got run out
of bog harbor.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.840
What? Why'd you
get run out
of bog harbor?

15:43.908 --> 15:46.076
For selling human flesh
to the restaurants.

15:46.143 --> 15:48.344
[all gasping]
ha ha, I'm kidding, people!

15:48.412 --> 15:49.546
Come on.

15:49.613 --> 15:51.247
[all chuckling]

15:51.315 --> 15:53.817
Hey, the subject of death
makes us all uncomfortable,

15:53.884 --> 15:55.251
Except mort.

15:55.319 --> 15:58.121
But what about
how we treat the living?

15:58.189 --> 16:00.707
'cause sometimes we end up
treating those bodies

16:00.775 --> 16:02.826
Better than we treat
these bodies.

16:02.893 --> 16:05.395
We break
each other's hearts.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.564
We forget important dates.

16:07.631 --> 16:10.333
We write hurtful things
on poster board.

16:10.401 --> 16:12.735
We mistreat the living
and no one seems to care.

16:12.803 --> 16:14.337
But once that body's dead,

16:14.405 --> 16:16.306
It's, "hey, don't mistreat
the dead body!

16:16.373 --> 16:18.174
"hey, don't eat the dead body!"

16:18.242 --> 16:19.709
That's the ultimate
crime, right?

16:19.777 --> 16:21.644
Murder, no big deal.

16:21.712 --> 16:23.580
Cannibal? Whoa!

16:23.647 --> 16:25.515
Is he defending cannibalism?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.417
No, I'm just saying--
cannibal!

16:27.485 --> 16:29.552
See, that's a new jersey--
damn cannibal!

16:29.620 --> 16:30.753
Folks, please,
I'm trying--no.

16:30.805 --> 16:33.156
Cannibals!
That's not what I mean!

16:33.224 --> 16:35.558
He's gonna eat us!

16:35.626 --> 16:37.961
[distorted yelling]

16:40.464 --> 16:42.966
Oh, thank god
it didn't break.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.901
Dad, dad!

16:44.969 --> 16:47.203
Forget it.
Never mind.

16:47.271 --> 16:49.839
Nada. No longer
relevant.

16:54.498 --> 16:56.875
He's right, isn't he?
We can test this meat
right here

16:56.943 --> 16:58.443
In the mobile lab,
can't we?

16:58.511 --> 17:00.245
We liquefy it,
add the enzyme.

17:00.313 --> 17:01.396
If it's yella, salmonella,

17:01.464 --> 17:03.065
If it's chartreuse,
it's a deuce,

17:03.132 --> 17:05.400
And if it's blue,
it's your aunt sue.

17:05.468 --> 17:07.285
I know, ron!
I know the rhyme!

17:07.353 --> 17:09.121
Don't you think
I know the rhyme?!

17:09.188 --> 17:11.156
It doesn't matter.
Don't you see,
he's guilty.

17:11.223 --> 17:13.058
If it's not human flesh,
it's something else.

17:13.126 --> 17:16.228
It's dirty hand towels.
It's--it's something else!

17:16.295 --> 17:17.863
Stealing your woman?

17:17.930 --> 17:19.097
Nuhh!
Ugh.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.031
Shut up, shut up,
shut up! [sobbing]

17:21.099 --> 17:22.400
Oh, ok, that's it, that's it.

17:22.468 --> 17:25.002
Let it out. Let it out.

17:25.070 --> 17:27.305
[bob sighs]

17:27.373 --> 17:29.157
You're a failure.

17:29.242 --> 17:32.010
You failed.
You fail at everything.

17:32.078 --> 17:34.146
You fail at marriage.

17:34.213 --> 17:36.948
You fail at family.
Your kids are failures.

17:37.016 --> 17:39.618
And you're fat.
You're not attractive.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.253
You never were.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.156
Well, you were a little bit,
when you were a teenager.

17:44.223 --> 17:46.057
But then you got fat.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.392
What is he saying out there?

17:47.460 --> 17:49.694
He's talking to
the restaurant, mom.

17:49.762 --> 17:52.998
Bobby, stop talking
to the restaurant
and come inside.

17:53.065 --> 17:54.266
Leave me alone!

17:54.333 --> 17:55.967
Bob, come inside.

17:56.035 --> 17:57.536
Come on.
Bob, come on.

17:57.603 --> 18:00.071
Bobby.
What's the use?!

18:00.139 --> 18:02.240
Dad? This is louise,
your daughter.

18:02.308 --> 18:04.242
Yes, louise. What?

18:04.310 --> 18:06.077
I'm sorry
that I told everyone

18:06.145 --> 18:09.381
That we make burgers
from human remains.

18:09.448 --> 18:10.515
[sighs] ok, louise.
Thank you.

18:10.583 --> 18:11.983
Dad, it's gene.

18:12.051 --> 18:13.351
Yes, gene, go ahead.

18:13.419 --> 18:15.053
Dad?
Yes!

18:15.121 --> 18:17.923
I think we have
a bad connection.
I'll call you back.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.424
Oh, my god.
I want to talk to him, too.

18:19.492 --> 18:22.060
I can hear you.
It's just glass.

18:22.128 --> 18:24.996
Oh. [sniffs]
now my rash
smells like bacon.

18:25.064 --> 18:26.364
And it doesn't
itch anymore.

18:26.432 --> 18:28.533
I think we're going
to be ok.

18:28.601 --> 18:30.101
Ok, tina, thank you.

18:30.169 --> 18:32.470
Louise: Dad,
is the restaurant
going to close?

18:32.538 --> 18:34.039
[sighs] I don't know, louise.

18:34.106 --> 18:35.407
We're almost broke.

18:35.474 --> 18:37.442
The whole town
thinks we're cannibals,

18:37.510 --> 18:39.244
And I forgot
our anniversary.

18:39.312 --> 18:41.346
You'd have been better off
with hugo, linda.

18:41.414 --> 18:43.081
Bob, please.
No, it's true.

18:43.149 --> 18:46.084
I can't even
satisfy you
with my kisses.

18:46.152 --> 18:47.352
Sorry, kids.
No problem.

18:47.420 --> 18:48.587
Thanks for the info.

18:48.654 --> 18:50.088
Oh, bobby!

18:50.156 --> 18:51.456
Now you
listen to me.

18:51.524 --> 18:53.225
I would rather
be married

18:53.292 --> 18:56.661
To a suspected
cannibal with
a dream like you

18:56.729 --> 18:58.496
Than
a soft-lipped guy

18:58.564 --> 19:01.032
Who never
had a dream
in the first place.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.068
You would?
No question.

19:03.135 --> 19:05.737
You're a hero
to your kids
and to me.

19:05.805 --> 19:07.538
Now come inside.
Come inside

19:07.590 --> 19:09.507
And make us
some food.
We're hungry.

19:09.575 --> 19:11.243
I'm in.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.645
I'm comin' in.

19:13.713 --> 19:15.747
[kids chuckling]

19:15.815 --> 19:18.750
Open the door.
Ha ha. Open the door.

19:18.818 --> 19:21.419
Seriously,
open the door!

19:21.487 --> 19:23.388
Kids, let your father
in the restaurant, please.

19:23.456 --> 19:26.024
Let me in!

19:26.092 --> 19:27.659
Still serving human flesh.
No.

19:27.727 --> 19:29.160
Yes!
No!

19:29.228 --> 19:31.263
We have kind of
an adventurous eaters club.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.998
We like to try new things.

19:33.065 --> 19:35.400
Can you seat 25 people?

19:35.468 --> 19:37.702
Oh, uh...Well,
we might have

19:37.770 --> 19:39.905
Some more human meat,
but it's, uh,

19:39.972 --> 19:43.008
$50 a burger.
That's a deal.

19:43.075 --> 19:44.676
Really--what? Really? Great.

19:44.744 --> 19:46.611
[chuckles] let's do it.

19:46.679 --> 19:48.313
Hello. Welcome.

19:48.381 --> 19:50.048
Human flesh
right this way.

19:50.099 --> 19:51.316
Uh, hi.

19:51.384 --> 19:53.385
Uh, hugo wanted
to give you this.

19:53.452 --> 19:56.087
It states clearly
that there was
no human flesh in--

19:56.155 --> 19:59.090
Shh! Shh. Yes, yes.
Thank you. Thanks.

19:59.158 --> 20:01.326
We were able
to expedite the tests,

20:01.394 --> 20:04.629
And we found 100% grade a beef--
shh, shh!

20:04.697 --> 20:06.398
Ron!
I'm just sorry--

20:06.449 --> 20:08.199
Shut up! Shut up.
Ok.

20:08.267 --> 20:11.303
Hi. Welcome.

20:11.370 --> 20:15.307
Linda, I can't believe
how much money
we just made.

20:15.374 --> 20:16.408
This turned into
a great weekend.

20:16.475 --> 20:19.544
Oh, bob,
it's gorgeous.

20:19.612 --> 20:22.080
Hmm. We seem to have stopped.

20:22.148 --> 20:23.648
Ahh.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.050
Bobby!

20:25.117 --> 20:27.352
You've been
practicing.

20:27.420 --> 20:30.121
Yeah. I went online,
got some tips.

20:30.189 --> 20:31.589
They have kissing
tips online?

20:31.657 --> 20:34.459
I learned a few moves.
Check this one out.

20:34.527 --> 20:36.094
This one is
your anniversary gift.

20:36.162 --> 20:38.129
[both giggling]

20:38.197 --> 20:41.633
Oh, bobby!

20:41.701 --> 20:43.568
Go, bob!

20:43.636 --> 20:46.338
Ugh, unbelievable.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.490
Aww, sick!

20:48.574 --> 20:49.774
Mom's really handsy.

20:49.842 --> 20:51.209
You're a couple
of sluts!

20:51.277 --> 20:52.644
I think it's nice.

20:52.712 --> 20:55.046
Hey! Get this thing movin'!

20:55.114 --> 20:57.882
I'm getting scarred
for life up here!
