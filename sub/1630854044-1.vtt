10:41.575 --> 10:42.807
Can you believe that?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.143
All right.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.015
You smell real nice, daddy.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.952
Hey, we said no phones.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.787
Oh.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.422
-You know, I'm nervous.
-Mmm.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.491
[sighs]

10:59.526 --> 11:01.459
I always get nervous
when a big article drops,

11:01.495 --> 11:04.195
but this one
has so much riding on it.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.502
It is beautiful out here.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.383
You know...

11:26.520 --> 11:27.786
It's funny.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.188
How you can grow up someplace,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.824
think you know
all the spots...

11:34.361 --> 11:36.061
And still find places
you've never been.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.597
So what's next?

11:39.633 --> 11:41.833
-Ah! Okay.
-[laughs]

11:44.004 --> 11:45.437
let's be tourists.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.772
We can get beignets
at cafe du monde,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.107
and oysters at felix's,

11:49.142 --> 11:52.477
and finish the day drinking
hurricanes on an airboat.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.213
Yuck. I had hurricanes
on a dare once in high school

11:55.248 --> 11:56.648
and I'm never doing it again.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.616
All right, well,
what about the airboat?

11:58.652 --> 11:59.718
I mean, they're awesome.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.785
And you know
I grew up in florida,

12:00.821 --> 12:02.020
I can show you
some sick moves.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.321
That I wanna see.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.857
But today...

12:07.928 --> 12:10.195
-Let's just be lazy.
-Mmm.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.733
-I like lazy.
-Oh, good.

12:20.707 --> 12:24.409
aw. God, she's changing
so fast.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.045
Feel like these last
six months just flew by.

12:28.014 --> 12:31.049
Yesterday, she looked up
at me and smiled.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.585
She had this, like,
huge big grin on her face.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.153
-[chuckles]
-it was so cute.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.322
All the moments I missed
with blue.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.491
[sighs] you're not missing it.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.092
You're with her every day.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.161
She'll do it again.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.029
I'll film it next time
and send it to you.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.037
This co-op?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.273
Gotta work.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.776
Haven't been doing
all this for nothing.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.483
It will.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.621

13:20.400 --> 13:22.267
baby, listen to me.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.104
You did all the heavy lifting.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.772
She's making the trip.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.841
If it was a no,
she'd send an email.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.510
She's coming because of you.

13:34.748 --> 13:35.914
[sighs] and I...

13:36.983 --> 13:38.583
...I want you
to take care of yourself.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.420
Mmm, that's why I started
swimming again.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.022
You need something.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.624
Maybe, uh...

13:46.660 --> 13:48.092
Weren't you and hollywood
supposed to go fishing?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.428
And I hate fishing and fish.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.096
Uh, being around fish all day.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.132
[laughs] well.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.468
That did not stop you
from going back to work
for your hot ex-girlfriend.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.037
What'd you say?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.773
Somebody jealous.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.776
-Uh-oh. [laughs]
-I'm not jealous.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.743
I'm not jealous.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.545
Nobody got nothing
on you, baby.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.295
Are you ever gonna drive
by the land again?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.232
Not yet.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.049
Micah already left?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.151
Yeah, he was running late
for his photography class,

14:47.187 --> 14:50.421
but he knew I'd kill him
if he didn't finally drop
them off. [laughs]

14:50.457 --> 14:53.691
I can't believe charley
had all of this hiding
in her garage.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.027
Hell, we need a vcr. [laughs]

14:56.062 --> 14:57.362
how's her campaign going?

14:57.397 --> 14:58.596
She won the primary.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.531
If I know charley, mmm,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.967
she'll be sitting

Now just take this.

of pop culture on young,

all the farmers your ted talk.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.176
Several times.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.844
Yep, with commentary.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.113
-[laughs]
-I first heard
about your name

21:56.149 --> 21:58.082
when I read up
on the freedom
georgia initiative.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.117
Well, it's inspiring
what they're doing.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.019
They're reclaiming the land.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.588
Black wall street
and a self-sustaining farm?

22:04.624 --> 22:05.856
-It's incredible.
-Yeah.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.426
We basically modeled our co-op
after yours.

22:08.461 --> 22:12.196
You know, csa set up.
Land trust next.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.898
You a real inspiration
around here.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.001
And this is my big sis, nova.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.937
She's writing an article
on the co-op.

22:20.606 --> 22:21.839
Nova bordelon.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.075
You have quite a reputation.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.509
All good, I hope.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.145
I don't shy away
from bad either.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.615
I've been watching
your profiles online.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.184
Powerful.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.453
Thank you, that land
means everything
to our family

22:35.488 --> 22:39.156
and my brother
sacrificed it all in order
to make this co-op work.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.159
Nothing extraordinary happens
without taking chances.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.597
[ralph] speaking of chances,
mr. Prosper been taking
a chance

22:46.632 --> 22:48.666
on this new youth program
we've been developing.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.900
-You wanna, um...
-Yes.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.503
-Yeah, beautiful, beautiful.
-[mo] let's do it. All right.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.305
-Hope to see you later, nova.
-You too.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.042
Excuse me.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.177
What you doing?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.513
-What?
-What?

23:02.548 --> 23:05.816
I saw the way y'all was
gazing and all that.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.485
Don't go pulling a nova, nova.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.687
-I know how you move.
-Don't.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.955
-I'm serious.
-Okay.

23:12.959 --> 23:13.958
[ralph] it's looking good.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.866
Y'all settle down, please.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.100
[indistinct conversations]

23:24.203 --> 23:25.903
look, I know it ain't much,
but please.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.671
[woman 1] ridiculous.
What am I supposed
to do with that?

23:27.707 --> 23:30.908
First you sit through
a million meetings,
what for?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.611
Once we cover overhead costs,
we'll be right back
where we were.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.579
When is that gonna be?
We all got bills to pay.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.548
Well, maybe a few weeks.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.749
-[parthena] maybe a few weeks?
-[woman 2] come on, ralph!

23:39.585 --> 23:41.752
One, two weeks.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.087
[group exclaiming]

23:43.122 --> 23:44.388
[indistinct speaking]

23:46.325 --> 23:49.260
like I said before,
this ain't nothing
but a pipe dream.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.062
Hey, hey!

23:54.434 --> 23:57.468
For those of you
I haven't met yet,
I'm mo evans.

23:57.503 --> 24:00.404
I'm here representing
the southern louisiana
federation of co-ops.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.641
What ralph angel and y'all
have accomplished

24:03.676 --> 24:06.544
over these last six months
is extraordinary.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.213
Eighty percent of those
doing the farming
are black and brown,

24:09.248 --> 24:11.482
but only 3% are owners.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.117
Well, it don't feel
any different.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.185
Well, it should.

24:15.588 --> 24:19.089
You are building
the foundation.
That is the hardest part.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.825
Okay, next is the house,
but you won't get there

24:20.860 --> 24:23.594
if you start measuring
the value of what you're doing
here to those checks.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.367
Every force out there
will try to tear you apart.

24:34.707 --> 24:35.673
Don't let 'em.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.314
I came to let you know
we've approved
your application to join us.

24:43.349 --> 24:44.215
[indistinct conversation]

24:45.618 --> 24:47.718
welcome to the 3%.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.087
[mouthing] thank you.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.121
[indistinct conversations]

24:54.227 --> 24:56.427
our revolution
is based on land.

24:56.462 --> 24:57.761
Know who said that?

24:57.797 --> 24:58.996
No.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.198
Malcolm.

25:01.234 --> 25:06.003
All the farmers that came
before us and died
on our land,

25:06.038 --> 25:07.238
they disrupted the system.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.241
They didn't just take
what was given to them,

25:11.010 --> 25:12.042
they demanded respect.

25:13.379 --> 25:14.378
This co-op...

25:16.749 --> 25:17.848
...Is for them.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.751
And now, it's our turn...

25:21.554 --> 25:22.887
...To disrupt the system.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.588
Reclaim what we lost.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.190
But...

25:27.493 --> 25:29.026
...The only way we could do it

25:29.695 --> 25:31.729
is if we move together...

25:33.099 --> 25:34.431
...As a unit.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.302
-[indistinct conversation]
-[man 1] makes sense.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.104
-[clapping]
-[woman 3] yeah,
let's stick together.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.760
[kenny] hey, billie.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.029
Thanks again.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.864
All that lida stuff
really gives me a headache.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.399
No, it's no problem.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.901
You get used to it,
it's like learning
another language.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.837
I mean, uh...

26:13.873 --> 26:16.040
A few of us are having
a bonfire this weekend,

26:16.075 --> 26:18.275
if you're not busy 'cause

26:18.311 --> 26:20.244
-I think you should
come along.
-Um...

26:20.279 --> 26:26.383
Yeah, I'm not really
the bonfire party
kind anymore, so...

26:26.419 --> 26:29.954
Well, we could maybe
do something else?

26:29.989 --> 26:32.089
-Go into town?
I know a place.
-Kenny.

26:32.124 --> 26:35.960
Look, you're really sweet,
but I'm gonna have
to stop you right here.

26:37.563 --> 26:38.829
Okay, just, uh...

26:39.899 --> 26:41.632
...Don't say no yet.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.334
It's all timing and...

26:43.936 --> 26:45.002
...I get it.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.339
I'm a patient man,
billie denton.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.775
Take it easy.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.146
[micah]<i> honestly,</i>
<i> I was just surprised</i>
<i> to see you.</i>

26:56.182 --> 26:57.481
I know.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.783
You looked like
a deer at the start
of hunting season.

26:59.819 --> 27:00.718
Oh, come on.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.220
[laughs] you never
liked surprises.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.923
Okay, to be fair, like,

27:05.958 --> 27:10.060
-surprises haven't exactly
gone over well in my family.
-Mmm.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.562
-Mmm-hmm.
-So...

27:11.597 --> 27:12.997
Yeah, and how are they?

27:13.032 --> 27:14.832
Your mom is all over the news.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.935
Yeah, I mean,
dad is killing it.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.137
You know, mom's campaign
is on fire.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.739
Yeah, squad is hot.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.174
Yeah, well, I mean,
she gotta win first.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.943
-Okay. Yeah.
-She gotta win first
but, uh...

27:26.846 --> 27:29.747
Honestly, I think
she missed california.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.182
You know what
I'm saying, like,
she loved it here, but...

27:32.218 --> 27:33.784
And you?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.519
You moving back to la too?

27:36.322 --> 27:37.354
Nah.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.590
Nah, I'm here.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.592
-Oh, so you finally free.
-[laughs]

27:41.627 --> 27:43.193
your parents miles away.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.828
-Parents miles away.
-No curfew.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.097
-No curfew.
-[laughs]

27:47.133 --> 27:48.565
-that's all.
-Nice.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.573
Walk the river with me.

-Micah.
-I want to, I want to,
I just, um...

28:04.650 --> 28:07.351
I got this family christening
to be to in a couple of hours.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.219
I just can't show up faded.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.523
So much for being
in the moment.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.525
But I'll see you in class.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.860
Cool?

28:20.433 --> 28:21.532
[groans softly]

28:24.403 --> 28:25.369

28:25.404 --> 28:26.403
Yo!

28:29.341 --> 28:30.674

28:43.622 --> 28:44.621
Um...

28:47.893 --> 28:49.927
You know, I want you
to know that...

28:52.231 --> 28:54.098
...Sometimes I like
to get out.

...With you outside...

29:00.139 --> 29:01.038
...Alone.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.207
Are you asking me out?

29:06.078 --> 29:09.747
It's, uh, it's been
a long time
since I've felt like this.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.185
Ms. Sandy,

29:15.221 --> 29:18.555

broke my family.

32:49.535 --> 32:53.470
I was looking for you.
You and that phone.

32:53.505 --> 32:57.040
-What's up,
millennial? [laughs]
-[laughs] I think I'm gen z.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.875
Why are you hiding over here?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.011
[groans]

33:01.046 --> 33:03.714
today was just a weird day.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.216
-You know, um,
my ex, keke?
-Mmm.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.785
I ran into her at the center.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.686
Ah, okay.

33:09.722 --> 33:10.954
That was the first friend I

33:10.990 --> 33:16.193
made down here,
and it was just, like, whoa!

33:16.228 --> 33:20.998
Like, we have all these
memories between
us, and... And...

33:21.033 --> 33:23.734
You know, there's
still kinda, like, this vibe.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.168
I don't know, I went to class,

33:25.204 --> 33:27.804
and my teacher started
showin' us all these,
like, weird, little...

33:27.840 --> 33:30.073
-Micah? Are you high?
-...Pictures a...

33:32.378 --> 33:33.243
-A little bit.
-Oh--

33:33.278 --> 33:34.244
I had to.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.712
I... Keke was givin'
me all this shit, like,

33:35.748 --> 33:38.315
"oh, micah, you never do
anything spontaneous."

33:38.350 --> 33:39.383
and you fell for that?

33:43.856 --> 33:46.757
-Oh, gosh, is it obvious?
-[laughing] yeah, mmm-hmm.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.092
-[micah exhaling] uh, man.
-It's okay.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.532
Now all jokes aside,
that thing...

33:56.468 --> 33:57.868
-...For tru?
-Mmm.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.936
Ah, it was beautiful.

34:02.608 --> 34:06.209
Wait, when I was baby,
y'all ever, I don't know, do
something like that for me?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.145
Your parents aren't
the lesson type.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.080
-[micah exhaling]
-but you...

34:11.984 --> 34:13.984
...Were blessed
from the minute you were born.

34:16.722 --> 34:20.323
-Come here. I love you.
-And I love you, too.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.294
-Come and join us, huh?
-All right.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.196
-When you're ready.
-Yeah, when I...

34:26.231 --> 34:27.731
Get it together.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.299
-[micah chuckling]
get it together... Right.
-Get it all the way together.

34:29.334 --> 34:32.069
-I'm gonna sit
right here and...
-All the way. [chuckling]

34:32.104 --> 34:33.503
[laughing] ...Figure
my stuff out.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.643
-What?
-[chuckling] girl,
micah is baked.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.114
Can you imagine
bein' 21 again?

34:44.783 --> 34:46.650
Nah, that would be terrible.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.088
-Nova?
-Hmm?

34:51.123 --> 34:52.556
A real movie?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.558
-[shrieking]
-ba-ba-ba-ba!

34:54.593 --> 34:56.393
Please don't make
me regret telling you.

34:56.428 --> 35:00.530
I can keep a secret... Now.
I've grown.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.433
Yeah, that was
too soon, I'm sorry.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.235
Your secret is safe with me.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.870
-[softly] it's just
so exciting!
-Mmm-hmm.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.474
-Can I be in the movie?
-But...

35:10.509 --> 35:13.143
-[softly] no, I... I know
that I'm not in the book...
-[snorting]

35:13.178 --> 35:14.177
...And I don't care
about that.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.779
-Just put me in the movie.
-[laughing]

35:15.814 --> 35:18.648
no, no, do you remember
when we used
to steal daddy's truck?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.817
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And we would hang
in the woods?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.252
-And put... Put that
in the movie.
-[banging]

35:22.287 --> 35:23.120
[whispering] shut up!

35:27.860 --> 35:28.758
What?

35:28.794 --> 35:29.659
[nova giggling]

35:29.695 --> 35:30.894
what are
y'all gossipin' about?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.463
Dominic? I wanna hear.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.632
Spill it! It's been
six months.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.101
-That's almost a lifetime
in nova years.
-Oh!

35:38.137 --> 35:40.937
Hey! That's not fair.
I'm not that bad!

35:40.973 --> 35:42.372
I was with calvin
for almost five years.

35:42.407 --> 35:45.842
[meekly] I mean, I know,
four a those he was
still married.

35:45.878 --> 35:48.011
Nothing to tell, mmm-mmm.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.646
Dominic is great. Mmm-hmm.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.215
Well, we're all glad.
We like him.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.618
And we were worried.
We didn't wanna lose him.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.786
You know you can
go through men like water?

35:56.822 --> 36:00.123
And where is this coming from?
And I haven't only dated men.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.225
And we never meet the ladies.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.328
You gotta find someone
when you're ready to receive
what they're giving.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.999
Ah! That sounds like some
<i> super soul Sunday</i> advice.

36:09.034 --> 36:11.735
[softly] I read
a lotta self-help last year.

36:11.770 --> 36:16.339
But nova, sounds
like you really found that.
Don't take it for granted.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.608
I don't. We're really happy.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.311
There's no drama with dominic.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.046
We just work together, it's...

36:24.383 --> 36:26.049
...Nice.

36:26.084 --> 36:29.486
Mmm, I just want
you to be happy, that's all.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.255
And it seems like dominic
makes 'ya happy.

36:32.291 --> 36:36.693
And if nice is enough
for you, then god bless!

36:38.564 --> 36:41.531
-All right. Go on. [laughing]
-all right.

36:43.135 --> 36:44.701
-[softly] so you're gonna
put me in the movie, right?
-[scoffing]

36:47.272 --> 36:48.638
I want more family tradition.

36:51.910 --> 36:52.742
This book...

36:54.279 --> 36:56.279
...Is the first piece
a property our family owned.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.883
And passed down
through generations...

37:01.420 --> 37:03.253
...They kept track
of the land in the back...

37:08.160 --> 37:09.593
...And the family
in the front.

37:11.897 --> 37:15.232
Our beautiful baby girl,
miss tru bordelon...

37:18.437 --> 37:19.636
...She was born on our land.

37:24.977 --> 37:25.909
You know, um...

37:28.847 --> 37:32.249
...I wasn't around
when blue was born,

37:34.419 --> 37:38.788
so I wasn't able to add
his name to the book,
my daddy handled it.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.527
That bein' said, I'm proud...

37:50.135 --> 37:50.967
...To add...

37:52.971 --> 37:55.005
...Miss tru... No "e"...

37:55.040 --> 37:56.473
[all laughing]

38:00.379 --> 38:01.211
...Bordelon.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.021
After everything
we've been through...

38:13.492 --> 38:19.062
...It's easy just to look
around, and see
the cup half empty,

38:19.898 --> 38:20.864
play victim.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.201
But when I look around,
that's not what I see.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.171
I see everything I need...

38:37.249 --> 38:38.515
...Right here in front a me.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.687
That goes for you too,
blue and charley.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.292
I love you all
with all my heart.

38:49.328 --> 38:50.694
[charley]<i> we love you, too.</i>

38:50.729 --> 38:52.362
<i> I love you mom.</i>
<i> I love you pops.</i>

38:52.397 --> 38:54.130
<i> Wish I was there with you.</i>

38:54.166 --> 38:55.832
I love you. I love you.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.504
-I love you, too.
-[softly] I know you do.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.550
[clearing throat] that's
all she wrote.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.219
[vehicle approaching]

39:16.254 --> 39:17.721
-[nova] hmm?
-[ralph angel softly]
who is that?

39:24.529 --> 39:29.599
Mmm-mmm. Get back
in the car and turn around,
you are not welcome here, sam!

39:29.634 --> 39:32.769
-[hollywood] did
'ya all hear, landry?
-Come on, now.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.572
Here me out, please.
We're family.

39:35.607 --> 39:36.940
-[violet] family.
-[ralph angel] you're
not family.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.175
I hope I'm not interruptin'
anything important.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.044
What do you want, sam?
Spit it out!

39:42.748 --> 39:48.618
I came here
to congratulate miss nova
on an excellent article.

39:48.653 --> 39:52.789
All right, tracing the names
of all these victims, that was
a hell of a lotta hard work.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.258
And your call to action,

39:55.293 --> 40:01.831
seeking out living
descendants to ensure the land
remains untouched was genius.

40:03.835 --> 40:07.137
But because a all that
hard work, we found out

40:07.172 --> 40:11.508
that our family is intertwined
with yours, once again...

40:12.811 --> 40:14.444
...In the grave.

40:14.479 --> 40:18.748
What are you talkin' about?
There are no landry's,
no boudreaux' s in that grave.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.919
Are you serious, sam?

40:23.822 --> 40:25.655
She wouldn't want this!

40:25.690 --> 40:27.657
Uh, vi? What's goin' on?

40:29.361 --> 40:33.496
Arsenault, those are
betty's people,
her maiden name.

40:34.833 --> 40:35.832
Parker's mother.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.301
Parker's a living descendent
of the massacre.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.271
And now, she's
filed a petition

40:41.306 --> 40:45.642
to overturn the historical
marker status on her land.

40:45.677 --> 40:51.381
With that piece, we can
finally expand the outlet
mall, as planned.

40:52.651 --> 40:56.152
We will remove
the bones first, of course,

40:56.188 --> 40:59.155
and then the concrete trucks
will pave over the rest.

40:59.191 --> 41:02.258
We've already been
in touch with most
of the living descendants,

41:02.294 --> 41:05.695
so it's gonna take a lot more
than your pathetic daughter
to overturn the marker.

41:06.731 --> 41:09.732
Huh! Well, we'll see.

41:11.536 --> 41:13.136
I better let you get
back to that baby.

41:17.008 --> 41:17.974
Sam...

41:23.248 --> 41:26.282
...You're sure you wanna
go down this path?

41:26.318 --> 41:29.452
<i> ♪ let you down</i>
<i> whatever you do ♪</i>

41:29.488 --> 41:31.821
you know where it leads.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.224
<i> ♪ I want when you're</i>
<i> goin' through ♪</i>

41:34.259 --> 41:37.126
[whispering] you didn't
leave us any choice, fine.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.530
<i> ♪ let you down</i>
<i> whatever you do ♪</i>

41:42.400 --> 41:46.002
<i> ♪ I want when you're</i>

41:47.539 --> 41:50.940
