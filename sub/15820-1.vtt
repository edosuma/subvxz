00:20.411 --> 00:23.013
Dr Collier would never
kill anybody, never.

00:23.053 --> 00:25.243
Uh-huh. Ellen is it?

00:25.656 --> 00:26.813
Ellen Parks.

00:27.034 --> 00:29.212
You're Dr Collier's receptionist.

00:29.344 --> 00:30.521
His secretary.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.158
He's not a medical doctor, you know.

00:33.198 --> 00:34.676
He's an important mathematician.

00:34.716 --> 00:37.092
He doesn't go around killing people.

00:37.215 --> 00:40.943
Yeah, well, Ellen, there's a dead woman
lying on the floor of his master bedroom

00:40.983 --> 00:44.138
with a big, big, big
gunshot wound in her face.

00:44.272 --> 00:48.496
So how do you think that happened
if Dr Collier didn't kill her?

00:49.598 --> 00:51.248
You brought his car keys?

00:52.784 --> 00:54.619
Any idea where your boss is now?

00:54.659 --> 00:56.769
On vacation in Hawaii.

00:56.839 --> 01:00.053
He stayed longer than planned.

01:00.813 --> 01:02.678
Hey, Flynn. they're ready.

01:03.266 --> 01:05.019
We'll be back in a minute, ok?

01:05.060 --> 01:07.304
–Wanna stay with her?
–You got it.

01:08.052 --> 01:12.367
I guess Collier never told his cleaning
lady he was staying late at the Luau.

01:12.407 --> 01:14.651
–Any I. D on the victim?
–Several.

01:14.663 --> 01:17.341
Two driver's licenses, two passports.

01:17.413 --> 01:20.647
All fakes, except the
pictures have been cut out.

01:21.026 --> 01:21.886
What?

01:23.425 --> 01:26.915
Let's hurry along, boys. I got
a date and the clock is ticking.

01:26.955 --> 01:28.494
Do we really need these masks?

01:28.534 --> 01:32.485
I declared her dead from the
hallway, but… hey, you decide.

01:33.973 --> 01:36.229
I got rid of the flies,
maggots, and ants.

01:36.269 --> 01:37.224
She cleaned up real good.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.320
You're a prince.

01:38.555 --> 01:39.727
–Flynn.
–Waters.

01:39.809 --> 01:40.980
Robbery-homicide.

01:45.094 --> 01:47.109
She was naked like
that when we got here.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.456
Yeah, that's what they all say, doc.

01:48.496 --> 01:49.355
Yeah.

01:50.070 --> 01:51.887
And guess what. The shot to the face?

01:51.927 --> 01:53.229
That wasn't what killed her.

01:53.269 --> 01:57.418
I'd lift the head and show you, but she's been
dead for 2 weeks now and stuff would fall out.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.835
So here's the order.

01:58.936 --> 02:01.956
Blunt force heavy blows to the
back of the head, 4 or 5 of them.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.883
Then the hair was cut,
clothes were removed,

02:03.923 --> 02:06.497
and boom, someone shot her in the face.

02:06.844 --> 02:08.342
Looks like love.

02:13.034 --> 02:14.032
Who might you be?

02:14.072 --> 02:16.833
Dr Tanaka, deputy chief Brenda Johnson,

02:16.906 --> 02:19.122
head of our new priority
murder squad from Atlanta.

02:19.162 --> 02:20.677
Nice to meet you, doctor.

02:20.717 --> 02:23.592
And you remember lieutenants
Flynn and Waters, don't you, ma'am?

02:23.632 --> 02:25.646
Yes, I do. Nice to see y'all again.

02:25.686 --> 02:28.458
Mind if I just jump
right in here, doctor?

02:29.085 --> 02:30.032
Excuse me.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.246
Any sign of sexual assault?

02:33.286 --> 02:35.547
I don't know, I'm not gonna
examine until tomorrow.

02:35.587 --> 02:39.179
I'm just here to declare the victim
dead and write it up as a homicide.

02:39.219 --> 02:41.011
Something a coroner's
attendant usually does,

02:41.051 --> 02:43.758
but some asshole at Parker
Center insisted on a doctor.

02:43.798 --> 02:46.167
Mm-hmm. That asshole would be me.

02:47.378 --> 02:48.887
Oh. Excuse me.

02:57.696 --> 02:58.779
Look, doctor.

02:58.930 --> 03:02.351
Just beside the ear canal
and on the edge of the lobe.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.856
That's not blood. It's dried vomit.

03:06.278 --> 03:07.721
Killer threw up.

03:08.846 --> 03:10.939
Over here. See?

03:11.942 --> 03:13.364
The rug's discolored.

03:20.173 --> 03:22.947
Someone used detergent
here to clean up the vomit.

03:22.987 --> 03:26.543
You might want to move this
light and put a marker over here.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.421
This crime doesn't
look premeditated to me.

03:30.523 --> 03:35.100
Sorry to interrupt your evenin', doctor, but I'm
gonna have to ask you to expedite this autopsy.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.450
When the body's ready I'll
go with you to the morgue.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.165
Thank you very much.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.901
Uh, Gabriel, I miss something?

03:44.987 --> 03:47.592
Or is your little priority
murder squad taking over the case?

03:47.632 --> 03:49.060
–Is that it?
–This is not my idea. Ok?

03:49.100 --> 03:52.136
This comes directly from
assistant chief Pope.

03:52.349 --> 03:53.193
Pope⁈

03:56.338 --> 03:57.075
Thank you.

03:58.518 --> 04:00.216
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

04:00.631 --> 04:01.899
Yes, lieutenant.

04:02.232 --> 04:04.364
I don't know who you think you are,

04:04.404 --> 04:07.638
but we were assigned this
case by captain Taylor.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.593
Well, there's been a change of plans.

04:14.651 --> 04:17.168
Look, since you're gettin'
emotional about this, why don't we—

04:17.208 --> 04:20.185
I don't get emotional.
I am damned angry!

04:20.702 --> 04:22.913
Well, thank you for speaking your mind.

04:22.953 --> 04:25.576
Look, I hate to pull rank
on my very first week,

04:25.616 --> 04:28.837
but I think it would be best if you handed
your notes over to sergeant Gabriel here,

04:28.877 --> 04:31.349
took a deep breath and
went on back to your car.

04:31.389 --> 04:33.539
I can get what I need
from your partner here.

04:33.579 --> 04:37.575
Waters, did you obtain a search
warrant for the car and garage?

04:37.615 --> 04:38.684
Hey, Gabriel,

04:39.184 --> 04:42.302
you might explain to deputy
chief Brenda Johnson here

04:42.342 --> 04:43.934
that this is a crime scene,

04:43.974 --> 04:46.139
that the maid found
the body in the bedroom.

04:46.179 --> 04:49.482
in L. A., that's probable cause and
you don't need a search warrant.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.817
The garage is not attached to the
house. The car's inside the garage.

04:52.857 --> 04:56.255
You need a prior authorization
to examine both, so I repeat:

04:56.295 --> 04:57.747
do you have a warrant?

04:58.306 --> 04:59.824
I'll take that as a no.

04:59.861 --> 05:01.206
Excuse me. Ma'am?

05:02.223 --> 05:06.645
Did Dr Collier give you permission
to open his garage to strangers?

05:08.381 --> 05:10.261
No. I didn't think so.

05:10.336 --> 05:11.309
Pardon me!

05:11.781 --> 05:15.704
Could y'all step away from what you're
doin' and come out of the garage?

05:15.744 --> 05:16.984
Thank you very much.

05:17.024 --> 05:18.514
Look, it's all one house.

05:18.554 --> 05:20.957
And the guy's secretary
gave us the car keys.

05:20.997 --> 05:23.043
No need to be a bitch about it.

05:23.864 --> 05:25.837
Excuse me… lieutenant,

05:25.909 --> 05:30.463
but if I liked being called a bitch
to my face, I'd still be married.

05:35.952 --> 05:39.010
She was ordering my boys around
like they were her servants.

05:39.050 --> 05:42.351
I need a warrant to look up
the victim's skirt, “y'all.”

05:42.391 --> 05:47.440
Look, Pope, this idea of a priority murder
squad—it's expensive and redundant.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.065
These are not objections I heard
when the squad reported to you.

05:50.105 --> 05:54.662
When the squad reported to me, it wasn't undercutting
my authority as captain of robbery-homicide.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.795
And to bring this
girl-woman-person—

05:56.835 --> 05:59.020
whatever it is we're supposed
to call them nowadays—

05:59.060 --> 06:00.796
Listen, taylor, we tried
running the squad your way,

06:00.836 --> 06:04.142
and we ended up with a 20-year veteran
of the department indicted for perjury,

06:04.182 --> 06:07.708
and the murderer was off doin'
interviews with Larry King.

06:07.748 --> 06:11.650
We're handing too many of these celebrity cases
off to the DA. with less than compelling evidence,

06:11.690 --> 06:15.320
especially when these big
defense lawyers get involved…

06:15.338 --> 06:17.764
Sliding back into O. J. territory.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.550
Are you telling me some computer
geek like Collier is a celebrity?

06:21.590 --> 06:25.938
This Collier's developed an antipiracy
program that his boss Dr Harlan Brown,

06:25.978 --> 06:29.139
fourth richest man in america, by the
way—I just mention that in passing—

06:29.179 --> 06:34.230
an antipiracy computer program that he
values at around a half a trillion dollars.

06:34.270 --> 06:37.198
Giving her this case is
a judgment on my ability.

06:37.238 --> 06:40.470
No. It's an acknowledgement
that we the department,

06:40.510 --> 06:42.460
need more specialization.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.901
Brenda is a C. I. A.
–trained interrogator

06:45.941 --> 06:48.258
with excellent references from
the Atlanta Police Department

06:48.298 --> 06:52.662
and a reputation for getting confessions
that lead directly to convictions.

06:52.702 --> 06:54.801
She worked for me in
Washington and I'm tellin' you,

06:54.841 --> 06:59.376
she's not Miss Congeniality, I'm
aware of that but she is a closer.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.816
Now, the chief wants this to
happen and I'm gonna do it.

07:01.856 --> 07:02.931
And hear me…

07:03.555 --> 07:07.777
because if that means I have to transfer
or demote people to get it done…

07:07.817 --> 07:09.522
that's exactly what I'll do.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.664
Guys work all their lives
to make deputy chief.

07:13.164 --> 07:16.442
I've given L. A. P. D 21 years.

07:16.549 --> 07:19.585
And she waltzes in here
from 3,000 miles away,

07:19.592 --> 07:21.826
not a day of experience on our beat,

07:21.866 --> 07:23.043
and she outranks me?

07:23.083 --> 07:24.162
You know the rules.

07:24.202 --> 07:26.491
She either starts as a rookie
officer or a deputy chief.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.445
There was nothing in-between.

07:30.039 --> 07:33.805
She doesn't have a sixth-floor office.
She's not included in conference.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.089
She's a deputy chief in name only.

07:36.587 --> 07:39.095
Well, she sure isn't actin' like that.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.911
You might find this helpful, sir…

07:44.619 --> 07:48.154
when you're thinkin' about who
you want to transfer or demote

07:48.194 --> 07:50.702
to make your little murder squad work.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.182
Hi, mama.

08:20.386 --> 08:23.029
No. No, I was just waitin' for my ride.

08:24.137 --> 08:28.691
Oh, no, they gave me a car. I just
don't know my way around here yet.

08:29.018 --> 08:30.415
Well, big.

08:31.146 --> 08:32.037
Everything's…

08:32.659 --> 08:34.640
spread out all over the place.

08:36.056 --> 08:37.046
It's beautiful.

08:37.648 --> 08:38.448
Sunny.

08:40.008 --> 08:42.039
Oh, I'm fine, just…

08:42.932 --> 08:46.496
everyone around here's so
perfect-lookin', that's all.

08:47.102 --> 08:50.034
Well… thank you, mama, but I'm not.

08:52.216 --> 08:52.970
Yep.

08:55.093 --> 08:58.264
Last night. My first investigation.

08:58.382 --> 09:01.917
Mama, look, you always ask me that and
when I tell you, you're always horrified,

09:01.957 --> 09:04.787
and it ends up being an argument
about what I do for a livin'.

09:04.827 --> 09:08.061
It's just too late to go
back and try the ballet.

09:08.111 --> 09:13.721
No, I'm-I'm not mad. I just—I just don't
have time for a life discussion, that's all.

09:13.731 --> 09:16.653
So. No. You tell daddy
that I'll call him back.

09:16.693 --> 09:18.145
Mama, my ride is here.

09:18.408 --> 09:19.539
My ride is here.

09:19.816 --> 09:20.793
My ride.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.045
Ok.

09:23.969 --> 09:25.446
Ok. You, too. Bye.

09:30.727 --> 09:33.895
Dr Collier deleted his
entire employment record.

09:34.288 --> 09:37.702
So. We have no picture and no
fingerprints. What about the DMV?

09:37.742 --> 09:39.699
Never had a California driver's license.

09:39.739 --> 09:40.833
Medical records?

09:40.998 --> 09:44.291
He had himself listed as a
christian scientist, so no checkups.

09:44.331 --> 09:48.007
And all the surveillance cameras at his
company, video gets taped over after 2 weeks.

09:48.047 --> 09:53.459
Great. So. This murder may not have been
premeditated, but this disappearance was.

09:56.282 --> 09:57.662
This can't be right.

09:58.756 --> 10:02.320
The victim's prints are
everywhere in Collier's house…

10:02.600 --> 10:05.275
In his car, in his office, too.

10:05.622 --> 10:07.800
But Collier's prints are nowhere?

10:09.547 --> 10:11.065
How did he manage that?

10:14.243 --> 10:15.936
Where's the financial report?

10:15.976 --> 10:18.220
Can you wait until the banks open?

10:21.926 --> 10:25.993
We need information off Dr Collier's office
computers and access to his professional e-mail.

10:26.033 --> 10:29.993
I already asked for that stuff,
his company won't cooperate.

10:33.171 --> 10:35.547
I'm sorry if you're tired, sergeant.

10:35.727 --> 10:38.064
I'm not tired… chief.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.625
I
–I can't. Look, I gotta go.

10:47.942 --> 10:48.644
Chief?

10:48.961 --> 10:50.203
Chie
–uh, chief.

10:54.163 --> 10:56.133
How are you today, detective Tao?

10:56.173 --> 10:56.926
Excuse me?

10:57.052 --> 10:59.192
Oh. I mean… fine.

11:00.072 --> 11:03.993
Sorry. Um… I was doin' some
background on Dr Collier?

11:04.405 --> 11:06.517
I found his mother this morning.

11:07.785 --> 11:11.613
The Elliott Collier with this
social security number died…

11:12.029 --> 11:13.351
when he was 19.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.582
Who is this guy?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.767
All right, detective
Tao, thank you very much.

11:27.576 --> 11:30.195
Ok, everybody, I hope you
finished your breakfast.

11:30.235 --> 11:33.849
We got an autopsy report to
go over everybody, listen up.

11:33.889 --> 11:34.590
Will…

11:35.654 --> 11:38.579
I didn't know you were
gonna be in here today.

11:38.619 --> 11:40.268
Don't look at any of this…

11:40.308 --> 11:41.398
Such a mess.

11:41.771 --> 11:44.543
Um… I didn't know
you were coming in here.

11:45.363 --> 11:46.891
Don't look at this.

11:48.603 --> 11:50.781
So. Uh, what's up?

11:51.321 --> 11:53.961
Uh, I have something I have to show you.

11:54.386 --> 11:57.747
Ok. The marks here on
the back of the head

11:57.822 --> 12:01.721
come from a small cube-like
object with a density of granite.

12:01.761 --> 12:05.598
Those are requests for transfer
back to robbery-homicide…

12:05.809 --> 12:09.718
from every single member of your squad.

12:13.876 --> 12:18.575
Now the first blow landed
as the victim was turning.

12:19.558 --> 12:23.122
And then the others came
after she had already fallen.

12:23.522 --> 12:26.020
I think captain Taylor put 'em up to it.

12:26.060 --> 12:26.956
But…

12:27.442 --> 12:30.149
truthfully we may have
underestimated the difficulty

12:30.189 --> 12:35.433
of having this new murder squad
run by… someone from outside.

12:37.196 --> 12:41.904
I would completely understand
if you decided this was…

12:42.062 --> 12:44.306
more than you want to put up with.

12:49.213 --> 12:51.325
Will, I sold my house.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.174
I turned down a position
at homeland security,

12:56.250 --> 12:58.758
which I'm sure is no longer available.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.955
If I lose this job…

13:03.095 --> 13:06.659
After the ethics inquiry I
was put through in Atlanta…

13:15.387 --> 13:16.207
You know,

13:17.199 --> 13:19.773
they may dislike me
'cause I'm new and…

13:20.185 --> 13:22.898
because captain Taylor
doesn't want me here.

13:22.938 --> 13:24.467
Relax, Will, because…

13:24.684 --> 13:27.006
once I get to work and
they see me in action,

13:27.046 --> 13:30.940
they'll have a whole list of
other reasons to hate my guts.

13:36.434 --> 13:40.084
About 12 years ago the victim
had breast reduction surgery

13:40.124 --> 13:42.627
as well as work done along the jaw line.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.159
Indications are she
had a nose job as well.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.222
Which means she was serious
about changin' her appearance.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.869
So, what do we know
about this crime, really?

13:50.909 --> 13:54.337
Or the motive Dr Collier had
for committin' it? Not much.

13:54.377 --> 13:59.146
No sign of sexual abuse. We
have a slug from a.44 magnum,

13:59.182 --> 14:03.202
which detective lieutenant Provenza
might walk down to firearms analysis

14:03.242 --> 14:07.018
to see if markings match up
to any known criminal weapons.

14:07.058 --> 14:09.733
And, detective… Garth…

14:09.939 --> 14:13.203
you could assemble Collier's
finances. Might be somethin' there.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.653
Detective Sanchez and detective Daniels,

14:15.693 --> 14:20.605
if you could join detective lieutenant Tao puttin'
together a more complete picture of this guy.

14:20.645 --> 14:25.142
And… keep sergeant Gabriel
informed of your progress…

14:25.903 --> 14:28.583
because we need to focus on progress…

14:28.748 --> 14:30.286
lady and gentlemen.

14:31.699 --> 14:35.148
'Cause all we have right now
is a woman we can't identify…

14:35.188 --> 14:37.564
murdered by a man who doesn't exist.

14:47.021 --> 14:50.046
Allowing you access to Dr
Brown's computer systems

14:50.086 --> 14:53.970
also gives you entry into
the new encryption program.

14:54.047 --> 14:54.999
Can't do it.

14:55.621 --> 15:00.302
And besides the idea that
–that Dr Collier murdered anyone is absurd.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.707
So, where's your client, Mr Banks?

15:02.747 --> 15:05.064
How come he never showed up
in his hotel room in Hawaii?

15:05.104 --> 15:07.790
Look, Elliott Collier is a genius.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.870
A little affected, a bit, uh, reclusive

15:11.098 --> 15:12.293
but he's not a murderer.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.803
What do you mean, “affected”?

15:13.843 --> 15:15.614
Well, like Steven Jobs.

15:15.701 --> 15:18.696
You know who he is, don't you? One
of the founders of Apple computer?

15:18.736 --> 15:24.287
Well, Mr Jobs almost always wears
khakis and black turtlenecks in to work.

15:24.434 --> 15:26.743
And Elliott copies him in that.

15:26.879 --> 15:29.486
And he's… terrified of colds.

15:29.572 --> 15:33.412
He always puts on plastic gloves before
he'll touch anybody else's keyboard.

15:33.452 --> 15:36.791
Now, is this obsessive-compulsive
behavior? Yes.

15:36.961 --> 15:40.308
But it comes with real
genius, Ms Johnson.

15:40.690 --> 15:46.478
Dr Collier's program may be the most profitable
innovation in internet technology since e-mail.

15:46.518 --> 15:49.436
And how much will this
antipiracy program be worth

15:49.476 --> 15:53.018
if this so-called Dr Collier
disappears and we can't find him?

15:53.058 --> 15:57.021
Under those circumstances I'd say your
encryption program's probably worth…

15:57.061 --> 15:58.518
oh, air in a jug.

15:58.595 --> 16:01.918
Uh, whoa. Whoa. What do
you mean by “so-called”?

16:02.039 --> 16:05.387
The man usin' the name Elliott
Collier created that identity

16:05.427 --> 16:10.047
by stealin' the social security
number of a teenager who died in 1989.

16:10.129 --> 16:14.215
So whatever you do… don't let
Dr Collier pay you by credit card.

16:14.255 --> 16:15.433
Ms Johnson…

16:15.732 --> 16:19.838
my law firm includes 2 members
of the L. A. P. D police commission.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.729
Don't begin your tenure
by antagonizing me.

16:22.831 --> 16:26.583
Wait. Wait. This-this suggestion
that Elliott isn't who he said he was—

16:26.623 --> 16:29.737
Now, isn't it possible
that you're mistaken?

16:30.991 --> 16:35.576
What's possible, sir, is that when I
release this information to the media,

16:35.616 --> 16:39.944
I can forcefully express my shock at how
a company whose entire reason for existin'

16:39.984 --> 16:41.768
is to make things more secure,

16:41.808 --> 16:46.362
but has been deceived on a daily
basis by its most valuable employee…

16:46.866 --> 16:50.232
What will that do to the
share value of your stock?

16:51.197 --> 16:54.018
I need Dr Brown to sign that waiver

16:54.110 --> 16:56.638
allowin' us to search
Collier's office and computers.

16:56.678 --> 16:57.897
Or I can…

16:58.345 --> 17:00.985
call a press conference. It's up to you.

17:08.550 --> 17:09.989
Thank you so much.

17:14.536 --> 17:15.337
Gentlemen.

17:15.443 --> 17:17.892
I'm walkin' this slug through
whether you like it or not.

17:17.932 --> 17:19.376
You think so? Over my dead body.

17:19.415 --> 17:20.368
Let me tell you somethin'.

17:20.409 --> 17:25.075
I've been in this department too long to
get mixed up in this political bullshit!

17:25.115 --> 17:26.791
–I'll tell you what, Taylor.
–You'll tell me what?

17:26.832 --> 17:29.218
–Yeah, I'll tell you what!
–I can't hear you.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.773
'Cause you ain't sayin' nothin'!

17:30.813 --> 17:32.043
What the hell is goin' on here?

17:32.083 --> 17:34.696
My men have cases been
waitin' 3,4 weeks down here,

17:34.736 --> 17:37.160
and they're gonna push
past 'em? No, no, no!

17:37.200 --> 17:38.868
I requested a transfer
back to robbery-homicide.

17:38.908 --> 17:41.205
Ok, do not screw with me,
Gabriel. You wanted this job.

17:41.245 --> 17:42.629
You campaigned for it.

17:42.669 --> 17:44.217
I still have your thank-you note.

17:44.257 --> 17:46.171
Give me the slug and move on.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.151
Come on, come on, come on.

17:48.376 --> 17:49.498
Bye, Provenza.

17:49.574 --> 17:53.072
Everybody, let's go. Come
on, go catch some bad guys.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.241
–Now, look.
–You haven't let me explain my side.

17:57.281 --> 17:59.036
I'm not interested in your side.

17:59.076 --> 18:01.626
You have no idea of the heat
we're taking on this case.

18:01.666 --> 18:04.052
I'm fielding calls from
senators. That's plural.

18:04.092 --> 18:05.648
Senators.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.473
Collier gets away, someone
is gonna be held accountable,

18:08.513 --> 18:10.229
so why don't you back off?

18:10.342 --> 18:11.933
Because if this case
has to crash and burn,

18:11.973 --> 18:16.134
I'm guessing you would prefer
that Brenda do that all by herself.

18:16.174 --> 18:18.402
I don't know what you're implying, sir,

18:18.442 --> 18:22.600
but I would never deliberately
screw up a murder investigation.

18:23.215 --> 18:24.370
Yeah. Right.

18:26.465 --> 18:29.831
Now, do you have a problem
with me cutting in line?

18:34.546 --> 18:36.041
Not at all, sir.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.404
Not at all.

18:44.352 --> 18:47.796
Dr Collier transferred
nearly every dollar he made

18:47.867 --> 18:51.035
into accounts connected
to the victim's aliases.

18:51.065 --> 18:54.965
I mean, Collier pays a lease on his
house, the gas, the electric, the phone.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.921
the rest goes mostly to
our Jane Doe. Like here—

18:57.961 --> 19:01.335
3 days before he leaves, Collier
transfers everything he has left

19:01.375 --> 19:03.318
into two of the victim's bank accounts.

19:03.358 --> 19:04.553
Sounds like blackmail.

19:04.593 --> 19:08.519
Except why would he transfer money to
her when he's plannin' on disappearin'?

19:08.559 --> 19:11.743
Hey. He didn't get rid of everything.

19:15.537 --> 19:19.563
Tech services is sending over
a couple things. Help yourself.

19:23.729 --> 19:28.522
No one gets in or out of his company's
secure area without an iris scan.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.850
Hey… does the iris have any
identifying characteristics,

19:32.890 --> 19:36.796
you know, like a limp or a, you know,
talk with an accent or something?

19:36.836 --> 19:39.587
Children… in the land of no evidence,

19:39.685 --> 19:41.482
the left eye iris is king.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.497
He's our friend. We're calling him Max.

19:45.037 --> 19:46.497
Oh. And I have these.

19:46.898 --> 19:48.746
Mash notes to his secretary.

19:48.811 --> 19:50.397
>From Dr Collier's e-mail accounts.

19:50.437 --> 19:53.491
“Ellen, I cannot tell you
how much last night meant.

19:53.531 --> 19:55.445
When your lips touched mine…”

19:55.488 --> 19:57.854
Oh! This she didn't mention.

19:59.596 --> 20:00.550
Uh…

20:01.266 --> 20:05.159
run it through the system and
see what we have on Ellen Parks.

20:05.199 --> 20:07.575
With a little cross around her neck.

20:10.990 --> 20:14.540
Now, what if Ellen found out her
boss was living with another woman?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.315
And killed her in a jealous rage?

20:16.355 --> 20:18.467
And what happened to Dr Collier?

20:18.883 --> 20:23.569
No. It's more likely she helped him
escape. But is she helpin' him now?

20:25.072 --> 20:27.733
Maybe Dr Collier was planning
on going off with this woman,

20:27.773 --> 20:29.819
and, Ellen killed both of them.

20:33.972 --> 20:35.754
Yeah? You wanted somethin'?

20:36.086 --> 20:40.892
Uh… what happened to the slug? You
get anything back from firearms analysis?

20:40.932 --> 20:43.110
Didn't college boy here tell you?

21:03.872 --> 21:08.668
Don't I even warrant a return call before you
head home to the beautiful and lovely Estelle?

21:08.708 --> 21:11.414
I was gonna get back
to you from the car.

21:11.476 --> 21:12.796
I have dinner plans.

21:12.841 --> 21:15.422
Oh, sounds vaguely familiar, doesn't it?

21:15.462 --> 21:18.894
Me waitin' to hear from
you, you off with your wife.

21:19.026 --> 21:20.016
Different city.

21:20.116 --> 21:21.203
Different wife,

21:21.804 --> 21:22.987
but still…

21:26.066 --> 21:28.931
The FBI hadn't gotten back to
me on our Jane Doe's prints.

21:28.971 --> 21:30.671
–That could take a week.
–Maybe not.

21:30.711 --> 21:32.225
I got a lot of friends there.

21:32.265 --> 21:35.166
But not hearin' from them makes
the firearm analysis more important.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.624
So… where is it?

21:36.990 --> 21:38.508
I
–I don't have it yet.

21:39.146 --> 21:41.044
But I moved you to the head of the line.

21:41.084 --> 21:43.988
And I made it clear
that's where you belong.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.074
Brenda, I just upheld your authority.

21:48.114 --> 21:49.143
This is where you thank me.

21:49.183 --> 21:52.168
You promised me there wouldn't be
any question about my authority.

21:52.208 --> 21:56.256
Every time I turn around, I'm havin'
to remind people that I go first.

21:56.296 --> 21:58.040
Makes me really popular.

21:58.916 --> 22:01.868
Well, why do you always
push harder than necessary?

22:01.908 --> 22:04.290
I mean, what does this slug
have to do with anything, really?

22:04.330 --> 22:07.766
Because the more I find out
about the victim and Dr Collier,

22:07.806 --> 22:09.353
the more they have in common.

22:09.393 --> 22:12.851
I think somehow they were partners.
They were both… livin' together.

22:12.891 --> 22:16.330
They were dropout artists, both
obsessed with hidin' their identities.

22:16.370 --> 22:19.180
And why do people do that, Will?
Probably 'cause they're criminals.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.261
And the bullet that was
fired in the victim's head,

22:21.301 --> 22:23.871
that could've been fired from
a gun used in another crime,

22:23.911 --> 22:27.724
one that the victim or Dr Collier
changed their identities to escape.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.206
That slug could tell me who they are.

22:31.298 --> 22:34.693
Look, Will, now is no time
to go all wobbly on me.

22:34.765 --> 22:37.314
Brenda, you have my total
support, you know that.

22:37.354 --> 22:38.399
I just—

22:41.193 --> 22:46.546
Well, there's a problem with your
management style that I did not anticipate.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.344
And I can't change the way
these guys feel about you.

22:49.384 --> 22:51.209
You're the one person I was countin' on.

22:51.249 --> 22:53.306
Ok, no, no, no. What
–wait a minute. That's not fair.

22:53.346 --> 22:54.508
I know what you're up to.

22:54.548 --> 22:57.240
You've always played
both sides of the fence.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.911
And I can just hear you now
with Taylor… “back off.”

22:59.951 --> 23:01.935
Brenda, that's
–you're just being paranoid.

23:01.975 --> 23:03.163
Come on, you know…

23:03.806 --> 23:06.916
You know how much… I admire you.

23:08.235 --> 23:09.255
You know.

23:11.831 --> 23:14.207
Yeah. That's the problem. I do know.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.583
You have led me on, Will, again.

23:18.681 --> 23:22.520
Which you've always done with women and
it's forgivable from a personal standpoint

23:22.560 --> 23:26.027
but this is my life.
You're screwin' with!

23:26.186 --> 23:27.546
My life!

23:29.544 --> 23:32.711
I want that slug back…
and I want that report.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.629
Have a nice dinner.

23:57.696 --> 24:01.487
Working with the portrait artist putting
together a picture of Dr Collier,

24:01.527 --> 24:02.716
but she knows something's up.

24:02.756 --> 24:05.044
Volunteers on weekends
for work in her parish.

24:05.084 --> 24:07.960
Never married. One arrest.

24:08.026 --> 24:12.624
Oh, great. In front of a planned
parenthood clinic. Lovely.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.489
All right, you've been with her
all day so you can stay with me.

24:16.529 --> 24:18.299
But just smile and look reassurin'.

24:18.339 --> 24:21.413
And, uh, sergeant Gabriel,
you can go on home.

24:21.516 --> 24:23.941
I'll be drivin' myself
to work from now on.

24:23.981 --> 24:27.743
Excuse me. Ma'am, can I talk
to you for a second, please?

24:34.722 --> 24:36.702
I should be in this interview.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.410
I don't need you.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.030
Ok, can I say something?

24:40.070 --> 24:44.730
You are taking this business about people asking
to go back to robbery-homicide way too personal.

24:44.770 --> 24:46.667
It's just-nobody…

24:46.995 --> 24:49.776
Nobody should've come in our
department the way you did.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.531
You know? And another
thing. Captain Taylor?

24:51.571 --> 24:53.851
I know you've had your trouble
with him, but he's a great guy.

24:53.891 --> 24:56.741
All right? He got the L. A. P. D
to pay for my masters at U. S. C.,

24:56.781 --> 24:58.602
and he got me my first promotion.

24:58.642 --> 25:00.708
–If you give him a—
Sergeant Gabriel, um…

25:00.748 --> 25:03.929
I think I'm old enough to drive myself
to work without being thought vindictive.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.541
Ok, all right, that
is not what I meant by—

25:05.581 --> 25:09.235
And as far as captain Taylor is concerned,
I should probably explain that I do not form

25:09.275 --> 25:12.514
my relationships with people
based on how they're treatin' you.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.732
That would be your mother, maybe.

25:16.350 --> 25:19.753
It's just that… you worked
late last night, that's all.

25:19.793 --> 25:23.357
Go home and get some sleep,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

25:25.263 --> 25:27.177
Bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed.

25:33.664 --> 25:37.028
Oh. Thank you very
much… detective Daniels.

25:39.058 --> 25:40.114
All right, then.

25:40.694 --> 25:44.028
Hello, Ellen. Thank you
so much for your help.

25:47.211 --> 25:50.323
Oh, I love your cross! It's very pretty.

25:50.468 --> 25:51.400
Thank you.

25:51.867 --> 25:55.959
My mother gave it to me when I
was thinking of becoming a nun,

25:56.023 --> 26:01.869
which is funny, actually, because
she was so against it at the time.

26:01.966 --> 26:03.987
Your mother didn't want you to be a nun?

26:04.027 --> 26:06.464
She's a bit of a church
activist, isn't she?

26:06.504 --> 26:09.782
Well, we're… very pro life. Yes.

26:10.210 --> 26:13.178
But… I guess there's a difference…

26:13.309 --> 26:16.364
between living by the
church's teachings,

26:16.475 --> 26:18.760
which we do, and, uh…

26:19.476 --> 26:21.475
withdrawing completely from the world.

26:21.515 --> 26:23.368
Well… if you ask me, the world…

26:23.408 --> 26:25.388
–'Scuse me.
–…shape right now.

26:25.422 --> 26:28.788
We could do with a few
more people wearin' crosses.

26:29.052 --> 26:32.682
So, your mother didn't mind
you working for Dr Collier?

26:33.185 --> 26:35.005
No. No.

26:35.356 --> 26:36.824
So she met him, then?

26:36.932 --> 26:39.572
He passed the
all-important mother test?

26:39.670 --> 26:40.644
Yes.

26:42.117 --> 26:44.018
So, you still live with your mother.

26:44.058 --> 26:44.971
Yes.

26:45.388 --> 26:48.132
My father died when I was 15.

26:48.529 --> 26:51.202
–So… I… –Come on, come
on. Show her the e-mails.

26:51.242 --> 26:54.080
Help with the mortgage
and stuff like that.

26:54.682 --> 26:58.161
So, you had a relationship with
Dr Collier outside the office?

26:58.201 --> 26:59.312
A friendship.

26:59.612 --> 27:02.951
Oh, I-I assumed that…
it was more than that,

27:03.033 --> 27:07.946
because you had keys to his
house, so I-I just assumed that…

27:08.794 --> 27:11.726
Oh. No.

27:12.102 --> 27:14.758
He would give me keys when
he would go on vacation.

27:14.798 --> 27:20.084
But… the keys didn't indicate
that there was anything romantic.

27:20.543 --> 27:23.965
I've actually never dated anyone…

27:24.051 --> 27:25.626
ever. So…

27:27.704 --> 27:28.831
Well…

27:29.236 --> 27:32.360
I'm so glad to hear that.
Because if you were datin' him,

27:32.400 --> 27:34.979
then the question I'm about to
ask you might hurt your feelings.

27:35.019 --> 27:39.200
Did you know that Dr Collier
was livin' with the victim?

27:40.017 --> 27:40.822
No.

27:40.857 --> 27:42.679
–He never mentioned that?
–No.

27:42.719 --> 27:44.885
You never met her or saw her?

27:45.111 --> 27:45.950
No.

27:46.567 --> 27:49.775
Well, they had a relationship
of some kind. Um…

27:49.865 --> 27:53.033
we found her fingerprints
in his office at work.

27:56.362 --> 27:58.160
Well, that's just…

27:58.576 --> 28:01.372
really surprising because…

28:02.074 --> 28:05.631
there are very strict rules
about that, and I'm just…

28:05.770 --> 28:08.918
It's just very surprising that Dr
Collier would do something like that.

28:08.958 --> 28:09.961
I know.

28:11.134 --> 28:16.480
It's always hard when we discover someone
we care about isn't who we think he is.

28:32.486 --> 28:34.043
Well, Ellen…

28:34.228 --> 28:36.562
thank you so much for your time.

28:43.590 --> 28:44.600
That's it?

28:49.516 --> 28:51.173
–We're finished?
–Yes.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.111
And you've been very helpful.

28:55.010 --> 28:57.967
But promise me something 'cause
I know he was your friend.

28:58.007 --> 29:00.970
Dr Collier gets in touch with
you again, you must let us know.

29:01.010 --> 29:01.821
Yes.

29:01.924 --> 29:04.156
Don't let me leave here
concerned about you.

29:04.196 --> 29:04.991
No.

29:05.175 --> 29:06.205
Thank you.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.707
Growing skepticism on
wall street that'd make—

29:20.390 --> 29:25.233
We're goin' a little bit lighter and
a little bit darker than your skin tone

29:25.273 --> 29:28.507
so that you will always
be able to match exactly…

29:32.965 --> 29:33.738
Hello?

29:35.681 --> 29:36.616
Fritz?

29:37.333 --> 29:39.819
Well, hi! How are you? Where are you?

29:41.140 --> 29:42.505
Oh, no.

29:43.209 --> 29:44.829
Oh, you're kiddin' me.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.613
No! No, not at all.

29:48.724 --> 29:51.206
I'll-I'll be right ther. Just down.

29:51.351 --> 29:53.206
Just, um… just gimme-gimme 2 minutes.

29:53.246 --> 29:55.214
Uh, just-just 2½.

29:55.430 --> 29:57.885
And-and order me a merlot. Ok?

29:58.060 --> 29:59.050
All right. Bye.

30:15.491 --> 30:17.053
Oh, Fritz.

30:18.221 --> 30:21.479
Fritz, I didn't know
you were livin' here.

30:21.575 --> 30:22.569
Since when?

30:22.670 --> 30:25.135
31/2 years. 30 pounds ago.

30:25.337 --> 30:27.240
You should try and stay
in touch more. You know?

30:27.280 --> 30:28.978
I know, I know. I'm terrible.

30:29.018 --> 30:31.856
I can't even keep an
address book together.

30:32.112 --> 30:35.413
No one could've made me believe
you'd accept a transfer to L. A.

30:35.453 --> 30:36.443
I love it here.

30:36.598 --> 30:38.314
You know what I like best?

30:38.505 --> 30:40.698
–This wine is yours.
–Oh, thanks. Thank you.

30:40.738 --> 30:43.899
What I like best is no matter
how hot it gets during the day,

30:43.939 --> 30:46.564
the nights… are always cool.

30:47.191 --> 30:50.465
You'll forget Washington
and Atlanta in one summer.

30:50.505 --> 30:51.760
Here's to no humidity.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.703
Cheers.

30:57.491 --> 30:59.822
So, you're workin' for Pope again, huh?

30:59.862 --> 31:04.146
Yeah. Yeah. I shoulda gone with you
to the FBI while I had the chance.

31:04.186 --> 31:06.574
And you? How's, uh… um…

31:06.686 --> 31:08.072
Elaine? Is it Elaine?

31:08.106 --> 31:08.993
Cindy.

31:09.603 --> 31:11.107
She's gone.

31:11.321 --> 31:12.516
No, it, uh…

31:13.131 --> 31:15.265
She started therapy and, uh…

31:16.072 --> 31:18.310
blah, blah, blah. Long story.

31:18.598 --> 31:19.742
Some other time.

31:22.070 --> 31:22.855
Ok.

31:23.470 --> 31:26.150
Jackie sent this over to
you from DC. this mornin'.

31:26.190 --> 31:29.750
Normally, you'd get it tomorrow,
but I saw your name on it.

31:29.790 --> 31:34.447
I did a little investigating. I thought
I'd hand-deliver it to you tonight.

31:34.487 --> 31:36.599
Before I give it to you, though…

31:36.932 --> 31:37.971
Brenda…

31:38.632 --> 31:40.728
I don't want you to just
tear it open and run upstairs.

31:40.768 --> 31:43.208
You gotta promise me you're gonna
sit here finish your wine, catch up…

31:43.248 --> 31:46.535
I will. Why does everyone
think I'm so horrible?

31:46.663 --> 31:51.415
And really, Fritz, do you expect me to believe
that after spendin' 3 years around the women here

31:51.455 --> 31:54.213
that what you really want to do
is hang around a hotel bar with me?

31:54.253 --> 31:56.299
Oh, shut up. You look terrific.

32:02.189 --> 32:05.816
Now, you really want to feel bad about yourself,
I'll take you up to Santa Barbara someday.

32:05.856 --> 32:08.822
It's like visiting
stepford. I kid you not.

32:13.284 --> 32:15.396
It's your I. D on your Jane Doe.

32:16.321 --> 32:17.311
You were right.

32:17.545 --> 32:19.327
Your victim's got a record.

32:19.814 --> 32:22.872
In fact, she's wanted for murder.

32:27.699 --> 32:30.289
Our victim's name was Alana Devon.

32:30.403 --> 32:32.666
She would've turned 40 next month.

32:32.813 --> 32:39.023
In 1991, she shot a security guard outside a
pharmaceutical company during an act up protest.

32:39.109 --> 32:41.617
I suppose you all know what act up is.

32:46.489 --> 32:48.552
Lieutenant Provenza doesn't know.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.876
Act up is an organization dedicated
to raisin' awareness about aids.

32:51.916 --> 32:56.539
Oh, jeez! Are you tellin' me
that she's a murderer and a lesbo?

32:56.959 --> 33:00.508
I'm sure, detective Provenza,
that when you say “lesbo,”

33:00.548 --> 33:02.703
you don't intend that
in a derogatory way,

33:02.743 --> 33:06.527
since that would mean you'd be spendin'
the next 2 weeks in a sensitivity seminar.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.746
Again?

33:08.188 --> 33:11.188
No. No. Lesbo is…

33:11.364 --> 33:14.127
I just thought it was short for lesbian.

33:14.225 --> 33:18.979
It isn't. So, yes,
Alana… was a lesbian.

33:19.083 --> 33:22.292
There's also some question as
to whether or not she acted alone

33:22.332 --> 33:24.110
or actually meant to fire the gun.

33:24.150 --> 33:26.849
Like Collier, she was
a computer scientist,

33:26.889 --> 33:30.201
and like him, she changed her identity.

33:30.316 --> 33:34.137
And the gun that fired
this bullet into her face

33:34.229 --> 33:37.515
is the same gun used
in the original crime.

33:37.633 --> 33:40.996
So you think Collier's connected to
this crime, too. May I see those, please?

33:41.036 --> 33:44.864
Yes, you may. I need to take
another look at Alana's body.

33:45.813 --> 33:49.773
Ok. So, I don't know how she
figures into this anymore, but—

33:49.806 --> 33:50.735
She who?

33:51.485 --> 33:54.194
Collier's secretary Ellen. Here.

33:55.753 --> 33:57.601
The last day he was in town,

33:57.607 --> 33:59.851
Ellen closes her checking account.

33:59.878 --> 34:02.056
Following Monday, she reopens it.

34:03.069 --> 34:04.035
Chief.

34:05.239 --> 34:07.324
The morgue released the body.

34:07.401 --> 34:08.172
What?

34:08.469 --> 34:09.857
On whose authority?

34:10.328 --> 34:14.379
As soon as the I. D comes out and the
medical examiner certifies he's finished,

34:14.418 --> 34:17.085
the body is released
by law to the family.

34:17.126 --> 34:19.491
You had no right to send that
information to the morgue.

34:19.531 --> 34:23.657
Family's been waitin' 15 years for Alana
to come home, they can wait 3 more days.

34:23.697 --> 34:25.302
I need her body to make my case.

34:25.342 --> 34:26.984
You're telling me you're
that close to finding Collier?

34:27.024 --> 34:29.120
If I can get his secretary
to cooperate, yes.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.147
And how does the body figure into this?

34:31.187 --> 34:32.159
What's so important—

34:32.199 --> 34:34.926
I don't report to you, captain,
so your question's irrelevant.

34:34.966 --> 34:37.540
–Excuse me⁈
–Everybody, just calm down.

34:38.195 --> 34:40.530
You need Alana's body to find Collier?

34:40.570 --> 34:42.616
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

34:44.302 --> 34:46.156
You'll have the body
back tomorrow morning.

34:46.196 --> 34:47.699
Thank you very much.

34:51.818 --> 34:54.474
Did you hear the way she
spoke to me? Did you hear?

34:54.514 --> 34:55.542
Sit down.

34:56.489 --> 34:57.755
We need to talk.

35:18.591 --> 35:20.958
I just wanted to say that, um…

35:21.184 --> 35:24.598
and I didn't mean
anything by it… but…

35:25.053 --> 35:28.225
I was the one who told Taylor
you had I. D'd the body.

35:28.265 --> 35:30.839
Well, I understand. He was your friend.

35:33.818 --> 35:39.121
Um… I usually get along
better with people around here

35:39.182 --> 35:42.152
than I have been with
you. I'm-I'm organized.

35:42.167 --> 35:45.586
I'm… usually pretty good at
figurin' out what people need

35:45.626 --> 35:50.297
or… what they think they need
or what they… want… from me.

35:50.399 --> 35:57.016
Uh… but… to be honest, I'm… havin'
a little trouble figurin' that out with you.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.612
Well, when all else fails
you can try bein' yourself.

36:03.967 --> 36:05.089
Yeah, well, that…

36:05.590 --> 36:07.775
sounds radical, but I'd be, uh…

36:08.800 --> 36:09.784
willing.

36:11.887 --> 36:16.654
'Cause I… Actually I have a
couple questions, uh… like…

36:17.370 --> 36:19.906
have you been able to figure
out how Dr Collier was able

36:19.946 --> 36:22.227
to get rid of his
fingerprints from everywhere?

36:22.267 --> 36:23.208
Yes.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.484
Oh. Ok. Um…

36:28.210 --> 36:32.050
and that… bit about gettin'
the body back and finding him.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.338
Now, is that true, or were you bluffing?

36:34.378 --> 36:37.635
Oh, I never… bluff,
sergeant Gabriel. I just…

36:38.737 --> 36:41.258
express my optimism forcefully.

36:41.983 --> 36:44.464
You ordered Ellen Parks picked
back up and held overnight.

36:44.504 --> 36:45.389
I did.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.196
I don't see how that helps us unless
she tells us where Dr Collier is.

36:48.236 --> 36:49.685
I mean, we don't have the gun.

36:49.725 --> 36:52.184
I mean, we don't have the murder
weapons. We don't have any witnesses.

36:52.224 --> 36:55.854
Ellen will be very helpful
with all of that, I promise.

36:56.612 --> 36:59.129
This more of your forceful optimism?

36:59.359 --> 37:02.324
Oh, no. It's my experience…

37:02.487 --> 37:05.589
Because as any good
interrogator will tell you…

37:06.706 --> 37:10.666
as hard as a secret is to
uncover, it's even harder to keep.

37:16.536 --> 37:17.922
Good night, sergeant.

37:20.408 --> 37:22.175
Um… sure.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.441
Good night… ma'am.

37:55.172 --> 37:56.109
Come in.

37:56.185 --> 37:59.931
Why did you pick this woman up last
night and then ignore her all day?

37:59.971 --> 38:03.415
Because I'm preparin' myself and
lettin' her stew. It's perfectly legal.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.531
You're gonna interrogate
her and walk out of that room

38:05.571 --> 38:08.146
knowing where Collier is,
knowing why the murder took place?

38:08.186 --> 38:10.034
I already know those things.

38:10.502 --> 38:13.304
You have proof this woman
is connected to the murder?

38:13.344 --> 38:14.786
I can place her at
the scene of the crime.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.328
I need her to tell me what happened.

38:16.368 --> 38:20.216
All right. What if you lay your
cards on the table and she stiffs us?

38:20.256 --> 38:23.213
Then you'll never see her again
without an attorney and we are screwed.

38:23.253 --> 38:25.981
Are you tryin' to encourage
me or make me nervous?

38:26.021 --> 38:28.036
I'm just tryin' to figure out
why you're so damn confident

38:28.076 --> 38:30.022
you can get this woman to help you.

38:30.062 --> 38:33.533
Well, because, Will, I know a little
somethin' about admirin' the boss

38:33.573 --> 38:37.005
and findin' out he's not
the guy you thought he was.

39:04.412 --> 39:06.139
All right, then, let's go.

39:11.995 --> 39:13.215
I thought you were my friend.

39:13.255 --> 39:17.006
It's important, Ellen, that you do not
say anything yet and let me explain why.

39:17.046 --> 39:20.567
–Why am I being kept here? I haven't done anything.
–Unless you let me finish speaking,

39:20.607 --> 39:22.947
I'll have to put you formally
under arrest. Is that what you want?

39:22.987 --> 39:25.661
If I do charge you with a crime
you'd be entitled to an attorney.

39:25.701 --> 39:27.839
Do you want me to charge you so
you can have a lawyer with you?

39:27.879 --> 39:29.898
No, I don't want to be
charged with anything.

39:29.938 --> 39:32.997
Ok. But there are things
that have to be said

39:33.086 --> 39:35.519
when we investigate a murder
or I'll get in trouble.

39:35.559 --> 39:38.847
Sergeant Gabriel here is gonna
to inform you of your rights

39:38.887 --> 39:40.721
so we don't make any mistakes.

39:40.761 --> 39:43.989
Ellen Radcliff Parks, you are under
investigation for murder. You have the right…

39:44.029 --> 39:47.438
She should shake the bitch by the
shoulders and see what pops out.

39:47.478 --> 39:50.538
Why do you call every woman you
see a bitch? Why do you do that?

39:50.578 --> 39:52.843
Oh, shut up, Daniels.
She's a murder suspect.

39:52.883 --> 39:54.000
Asshole.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.336
And proud of it.

39:55.650 --> 39:57.921
Do you wish to continue at this time
and waive your right to an attorney?

39:57.961 --> 39:58.984
Yes, yes.

40:02.976 --> 40:04.314
Sit down, please.

40:06.656 --> 40:09.588
Now, I want you to know that I've
kept the police from arresting you,

40:09.628 --> 40:12.427
and I have done this
because I wanna help you.

40:12.467 --> 40:15.222
Because we want real justice
here but I have to tell you

40:15.262 --> 40:18.694
how disappointed I am,
Ellen because you lied to me.

40:19.158 --> 40:22.146
Here is the email correspondence
between you and Dr Collier,

40:22.186 --> 40:25.436
which directly contradicts this notion
that you and he were only friends.

40:25.476 --> 40:29.964
You were not just friends, you were
having an affair, isn't that so?

40:35.101 --> 40:36.332
It wasn't an affair.

40:36.372 --> 40:39.090
You loved him. He loved
you. You wrote it here. See?

40:39.130 --> 40:40.450
It wasn't an affair.

40:40.488 --> 40:42.404
You kissed. You were
romantic with each other.

40:42.444 --> 40:43.932
We never—
I never—

40:44.023 --> 40:46.113
Ellen, I'm sorry, I
can't. Sergeant Gabriel.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.749
Just wait a minute. Just wait a minute.

40:47.789 --> 40:50.562
I am telling you that
it wasn't an affair.

40:50.644 --> 40:52.627
I had never—

40:52.819 --> 40:55.100
We were not… physical.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.245
But you were emotionally intimate.

41:06.261 --> 41:07.208
Yes.

41:10.261 --> 41:14.484
Now, Ellen, I know the answers to most of
these questions, so do not lie to me again

41:14.524 --> 41:18.932
or I'll have to accept the fact that
I can't help you, and I'll leave.

41:18.972 --> 41:23.926
Now, you and Dr Collier were very
close. You loved him. He loved you.

41:24.049 --> 41:27.019
Did he tell you that
he had changed his name?

41:30.111 --> 41:31.030
Yes.

41:31.437 --> 41:34.209
That's good, Ellen.
That's a relief to me.

41:34.307 --> 41:37.670
You're telling me the truth
now. Let's stick with that.

41:37.710 --> 41:41.491
Did he tell you that he was
living under a false identity?

41:41.531 --> 41:42.268
Yes.

41:42.303 --> 41:45.728
And that he was involved with
the shooting of a security guard?

41:45.768 --> 41:46.603
Yes.

41:48.032 --> 41:51.398
And you kept that information
from the police, why?

41:51.814 --> 41:55.154
Because it was an accident.

41:55.327 --> 41:56.862
He didn't mean to kill anybody.

41:56.902 --> 41:58.618
And he showed you the gun?

42:01.764 --> 42:04.056
Yes, yes, he showed it to me.

42:05.182 --> 42:07.036
And did he tell you

42:07.243 --> 42:09.801
that in spite of everything
he had done to hide himself,

42:09.841 --> 42:12.547
that someone had
recently recognized him?

42:16.075 --> 42:17.380
Yes.

42:18.231 --> 42:22.036
So, Dr Collier decided
that he'd have to disappear,

42:22.159 --> 42:24.337
and he wanted you to go with him?

42:24.695 --> 42:27.623
I didn't… have any…

42:28.231 --> 42:30.865
intention of going—
–You closed your checking account.

42:30.905 --> 42:34.323
Ellen, I warned you about
lying. I'm sorry. Sergeant.

42:34.363 --> 42:35.822
I was not
–would you please wait a minute!?

42:35.862 --> 42:37.944
I said, I had not decided…

42:38.281 --> 42:41.100
to go with him. I am not lying!

42:44.401 --> 42:46.052
Let me explain.

42:46.233 --> 42:50.210
I think I know where
she's going with this.

42:50.661 --> 42:53.065
Elliott had told me

42:53.429 --> 42:55.459
that if I went with him…

42:58.123 --> 43:03.085
that I wouldn't be able
to see my mother anymore…

43:03.554 --> 43:06.053
that I couldn't even call her.

43:06.678 --> 43:08.713
So I had not decided.

43:08.793 --> 43:11.025
But you went to his house that night,

43:11.065 --> 43:14.167
and he had a passport
for you, a fake passport.

43:15.824 --> 43:17.936
You can just nod if you want to.

43:21.762 --> 43:25.344
Now, let's talk about
Alana Devon for a moment.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.823
'Cause that night you were leavin',

43:28.863 --> 43:31.635
that was when you
first met her, isn't it?

43:46.721 --> 43:48.445
Could you ask him…

43:49.662 --> 43:51.872
to step outside, please?

43:52.220 --> 43:52.992
Yes.

43:53.433 --> 43:54.285
Go on.

44:09.352 --> 44:11.134
I'll help you through this.

44:11.785 --> 44:12.690
Sit down.

44:18.119 --> 44:20.033
These things have to be said…

44:20.312 --> 44:23.888
even though what Alana
did to you was so unfair…

44:24.027 --> 44:25.499
and so unkind.

44:35.899 --> 44:40.832
Alana Devon fired the actual shot
that killed the security guard.

44:41.316 --> 44:42.365
People saw her.

44:42.586 --> 44:46.913
So she used her computer skills to
hack into atms and credit card accounts.

44:46.953 --> 44:48.509
And she disappeared.

44:49.860 --> 44:51.455
She had plastic surgery.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.336
That changed her jaw line and her nose

44:54.590 --> 44:56.372
and reduced her breasts.

44:58.433 --> 45:02.195
And she proceeded to live her
life in permanent disguise.

45:03.950 --> 45:08.900
She always wore turtle necks to hide
the fact that she had no adam's apple.

45:09.455 --> 45:12.129
She also claimed to be
a christian scientist,

45:12.169 --> 45:15.469
so she wouldn't have to
take the company physical.

45:16.367 --> 45:22.302
That's why we only found Alana's
fingerprints in Dr Collier's house

45:22.812 --> 45:25.293
and in his office and in his car.

45:26.612 --> 45:29.582
Not because Alana was
living with Dr Collier,

45:29.682 --> 45:32.926
but because she was Dr Collier.

45:40.665 --> 45:43.305
Do you know how I can prove this, Ellen?

45:44.833 --> 45:48.794
The shot that was fired in
Alana's face missed her left eye.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.757
And when I took her
body back to the morgue,

45:51.797 --> 45:54.360
I found that the iris
scan of Alana's left eye

45:54.400 --> 45:58.766
matched exactly the scan of
Elliott Collier's left eye.

45:59.162 --> 46:03.584
So the man with whom you were
having an affair wasn't a man at all.

46:03.786 --> 46:05.248
He was a woman.

46:06.507 --> 46:08.619
And that night you were leaving,

46:08.892 --> 46:10.698
he told you the truth.

46:11.311 --> 46:13.844
He showed you who he was.

46:14.635 --> 46:16.747
I have it right, don't I, Ellen?

46:22.401 --> 46:23.977
Or are you a lesbian?

46:25.649 --> 46:27.167
Maybe you're a lesbian.

46:27.204 --> 46:29.114
If you are a lesbian, I'd—

46:29.190 --> 46:31.627
I am not…

46:33.206 --> 46:35.178
a lesbian.

46:37.932 --> 46:40.126
How could you say that to me?

46:40.744 --> 46:42.570
How could you say something

46:42.698 --> 46:47.071
so disgusting and so horrible?

46:49.171 --> 46:50.786
How could you say that?

47:00.489 --> 47:03.359
But you didn't mean
to kill him, did you?

47:04.272 --> 47:06.199
You hadn't planned on that.

47:11.534 --> 47:13.382
Just for the record, though,

47:13.509 --> 47:16.479
just so it's clear that
it wasn't on purpose,

47:16.523 --> 47:18.833
could you please say that out loud?

47:32.344 --> 47:33.643
I didn't…

47:36.662 --> 47:37.803
mean…

47:39.515 --> 47:40.743
to kill him.

47:53.474 --> 47:56.339
I was kissing him, and she…

47:58.736 --> 48:00.826
pulled my hand down…

48:01.680 --> 48:05.051
against her and I…

48:06.632 --> 48:09.513
I picked the paperweight up…

48:11.644 --> 48:13.624
off the desk, and I…

48:17.164 --> 48:20.659
I hit him over the head with it.

48:23.675 --> 48:26.957
I… I hit her in the head.

48:29.606 --> 48:32.517
Then when she fell, I
just beat her head in.

48:34.777 --> 48:37.175
I just beat her head in.

48:38.769 --> 48:42.388
At some point, you
realized that Alana's face

48:42.880 --> 48:45.426
still looked like Elliott Collier.

48:45.913 --> 48:47.955
And you didn't want
to leave it like that.

48:47.995 --> 48:52.119
I, uh… I cut all her hair off,
and I took all her clothes off

48:52.220 --> 48:55.055
because I didn't want anyone
to think it was Elliott.

48:55.095 --> 48:59.244
I just wanted to
–I wanted them to think it was a woman.

49:02.943 --> 49:05.767
And so you took the gun
that he had showed you,

49:05.807 --> 49:07.721
and you shot her in the face.

49:16.666 --> 49:17.914
I am…

49:21.469 --> 49:22.751
I am not…

49:23.844 --> 49:25.245
a lesbian.

49:26.551 --> 49:31.180
I am… a… good catholic girl.

49:32.035 --> 49:37.675
And I have tried to be
one every day of my life.

50:04.532 --> 50:05.453
Good work.

50:11.190 --> 50:14.094
I have to make my final
report to the chief.

50:14.403 --> 50:18.339
I'm sure he'll wanna call you
in the morning with his regards.

50:18.379 --> 50:19.584
Can't wait.

50:21.661 --> 50:22.496
Right.

50:23.381 --> 50:24.275
Well…

50:26.850 --> 50:27.663
good night.

50:28.173 --> 50:29.059
Good night.

50:30.793 --> 50:31.581
Sergeant.

50:31.874 --> 50:33.009
Good night, sir.

50:36.578 --> 50:40.998
So, sure you won't join
us for a drink, celebrate?

50:43.029 --> 50:47.772
No. I gotta take this
stuff back to the hotel.

50:48.138 --> 50:49.590
Maybe some other time.

50:50.668 --> 50:51.999
Sure. Sure.

50:57.327 --> 51:00.983
You know, you were right
from the very beginning.

51:01.983 --> 51:06.436
Looked like love.
