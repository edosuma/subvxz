A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.983
400 YEARS
HAVE PASSED.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.485
ONCE AGAIN,

00:18.551 --> 00:21.054
IT IS TIME
FOR A NEW WARRIOR

00:21.121 --> 00:23.690
TO EMERGE
FROM THE DARKNESS.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.392
( male )
HOW DID THIS
HAPPEN TO ME ?

00:25.458 --> 00:28.128
YOU MADE A DEAL,
YOU STUPID SON-OF-A-BITCH.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.631
YOU CUT A DEAL
FOR YOUR SOUL.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.167
JESUS !

00:35.668 --> 00:38.204
STAY OUT...
... HIS ALLEYS.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.273
... RED CLOAK.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.475
I THINK HE SAID
"CLOAK", SIR.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.977
YOU CAME BACK
FOR HER, SPAWN.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.513
YOU CAME BACK
FOR WANDA.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.751
THIS IS A
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

00:51.818 --> 00:53.386
SECURITY SHIP
COMMANDER.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.088
YOU HAVE ENTERED A
RESTRICTED ORDNANCE

00:55.155 --> 00:56.623
STORAGE FACILITY.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.026
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CODE NUMBERS, TERRY.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.128
WE LOST A RATHER LARGE
NUMBER OF WEAPONS

01:02.195 --> 01:03.997
FROM THAT ORDNANCE
ANNEX A WEEK AGO.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.399
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
AN INSIDE JOB, SIR.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.201
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

01:10.470 --> 01:12.505
LET'S FOCUS.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.641
THE GUNS, THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,

01:14.707 --> 01:15.942
NOTHING ELSE.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.277
NOT WORRIED ABOUT
THE BOY SCOUT ?

01:17.343 --> 01:20.447
TERRY'S BEING MONITORED
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

01:20.513 --> 01:22.615
SOMEONE'S GOT
YOUR WEAPONS.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.419
SO THAT'S IT NOW--

01:26.486 --> 01:28.321
IT'S BECOME
AN EYE-FOR-AN-EYE.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.956
( Spawn )
LISTEN OLD MAN,

01:30.023 --> 01:32.192
THE GOVERNMENT TAUGHT ME
HOW TO FIGHT, HOW TO KILL.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.760
IT'S ALL
I GOT LEFT.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.428
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE STOMACH FOR IT,

01:35.495 --> 01:36.863
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.965
THERE ARE FORCES
AT WORK HERE, CHAPEL.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.468
SHADOW PLAYERS WHO
DECIDED TO REMAIN NAMELESS

01:41.534 --> 01:43.770
FOR THE TIME BEING.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.638
SOMEONE'S
PLAYING YOUR GAME.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.173
WE'LL SEE.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.845
HONEY, WHERE'D
YOU GET THIS ?

01:51.911 --> 01:54.848
HE GAVE IT TO ME,
MOMMY, HE DID.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.016
WHO, SWEETHEART ?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.085
THE SAD MAN.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.820
( Spawn )
WANDA...

02:00.887 --> 02:03.223
AL...

02:05.925 --> 02:09.162
YOU REALLY FUCKED
YOURSELF THIS TIME.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.297
THIS AIN'T OVER, SPAWN.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.800
YOU MADE
A FUCKING DEAL.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.883
NO !!

03:19.799 --> 03:21.067
BETRAYAL...

03:21.134 --> 03:22.435
IT CUTS THE DEEPEST

03:22.502 --> 03:24.504
WHEN THE BETRAYER'S
SOMEONE CLOSE,

03:24.571 --> 03:26.306
SOMEONE
YOU'VE TRUSTED.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.341
THE GUY YOU THOUGHT
WAS YOUR BUDDY

03:28.408 --> 03:31.811
AND WHO'S HAND YOU WOULD
HAVE PLACED YOUR LIFE.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.917
IN THE CASE
OF AL SIMMONS,

03:37.984 --> 03:40.053
THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL
WAS TO FIND HIMSELF

03:40.119 --> 03:42.555
STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF A FLAMETHROWER.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.724
THE GUY AT THE OTHER END
PULLING THE TRIGGER,

03:44.791 --> 03:47.226
THE GUY
THAT HE TRUSTED,

03:47.293 --> 03:49.796
NOW SMILING AS HE WATCHED
AL BURN ALIVE.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.452
WHERE DO
THE DEAD BELONG

04:12.518 --> 04:15.622
IN THE WORLD
OF THE LIVING ?

04:17.023 --> 04:19.092
FOR THIS
NEWEST SPAWN,

04:19.158 --> 04:22.061
MOMENTS OF PEACE
NEVER COME.

04:22.128 --> 04:27.767
HIS MEMORIES ARE FRAGMENTS
OF THE LIFE HE ONCE HAD.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.370
FOR A HELL SPAWN,

04:30.436 --> 04:35.975
MEMORIES REPLAY HIS
SOUL'S OWN PERSONAL HELL.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.049
( male )
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SPEAK UP AL,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.684
IF YOU WANT
TO BE HEARD.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.721
( screaming )

05:15.782 --> 05:18.618
OH BOY, WHATCHA
DOING, TOUGH GUY ?

05:18.685 --> 05:20.186
LET ME GUESS--

05:20.253 --> 05:21.587
YOU'RE JUST NOW
REMEMBERING

05:21.654 --> 05:24.757
WHO TORCHED
YOUR SORRY ASS.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.261
I LOVE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

05:28.327 --> 05:32.532
TIME FOR YOU TO LEARN
SOMETHING FROM ALL THIS,

05:32.598 --> 05:33.933
SPAWN,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.636
NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED.

05:36.703 --> 05:40.873
THIS WORLD
ISN'T ABOUT TRUST.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.744
IT'S ABOUT DOMINANCE
AND SUBMISSION.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.747
IT'S ABOUT POWER.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.450
IT'S NEVER
ABOUT TRUST.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.519
I MEAN YOU COULDN'T TRUST
YOUR SWEET LITTLE WANDA

05:53.586 --> 05:57.690
WITH GOOD OLD TERRY,
RIGHT ?

05:57.757 --> 06:00.593
YOU'RE ALONE NOW,
SPAWN.

06:00.660 --> 06:04.063
AIN'T NO ONE COVERING
YOUR BACK ANYMORE.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.304
I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU GET ROUGH.

06:11.370 --> 06:15.174
GO ON, DO IT,
LET YOURSELF GO, SPAWN.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.344
YOU GOT
THE KILLING FEVER.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.053
( narrator )
WINTER HAS BROUGHT
THE HUNTER'S MOON

06:27.120 --> 06:30.623
WITH IT'S COLD
WHITE LIGHT.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.426
THE HUNTER'S MOON
IS SO BRIGHT

06:33.493 --> 06:37.497
THAT PREDATORS
CHOOSE THIS NIGHT FOR THE HUNT,

06:37.563 --> 06:40.166
AND TONIGHT
IN THE ALLEYS,

06:40.233 --> 06:44.270
SPAWN CAN SENSE
THAT HE IS THE HUNTED ONE.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.007
HEY AL,
COME ON OVER.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.042
IT'S WARM BY THE FIRE.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.346
THE HELL SPAWN
HIDES HIMSELF AWAY,

06:53.412 --> 06:57.183
WITH THAT INSTINCT
WHICH PREDATORS HAVE,

06:57.250 --> 07:02.355
AWAY FROM WEARINESS,
CONFUSION, AND TORMENT.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.024
THEY CHOOSE SOLITUDE,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.527
HIDING
IN THE SHADOWS.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.630
THEY ARE NOT
YOUR ENEMIES.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.466
THEY ARE THE ONLY
FRIENDS YOU HAVE.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.801
FRIENDS ?!

07:14.867 --> 07:16.636
THEY ARE MY ENEMIES !

07:28.047 --> 07:32.285
( narrator )
A HELL SPAWN IS RETURNED
TO EARTH SOUL-LESS.

07:32.351 --> 07:36.756
HIS MIND RAVAGED,
HIS MEMORY SHATTERED.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.702
THEY TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME !

07:55.141 --> 07:57.476
THEY MADE ME
A MONSTER.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.680
MR. RIMERE,

08:00.746 --> 08:02.782
WITH YOUR COUNTRY'S
REPUTATION,

08:02.849 --> 08:04.584
NO ONE IN
THE FREE WORLD

08:04.650 --> 08:07.286
WILL SELL YOU THESE
KINDS OF WEAPONS

08:07.353 --> 08:08.554
EXCEPT FOR ME.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.389
400 MILLION
WINS YOUR WAR.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.965
WYNN, YOU'RE
A BEAUTIFUL MAN.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.868
YOU START A WAR AND THEN
SELL ARMS TO BOTH SIDES.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.804
WHOEVER WINS,
YOU'RE HIS NEW
BEST FRIEND.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.505
YOU HAVE YOUR
DIRECTIVES.

08:26.572 --> 08:27.974
IT'S NOT
WORKING FOR ME.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.909
THE ALLEY LOCATION
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.678
MISSILE FRAGMENTS WERE
FOUND IN THOSE ALLEYS,

08:32.745 --> 08:34.881
SERIAL NUMBERS MATCH
OUR MISSING WEAPONS.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.084
LET'S GET SOMETHING
CLEAR RIGHT NOW.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.052
I OWN YOU.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.189
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HOW
YOU THINK THINGS SHOULD WORK,

08:43.256 --> 08:44.757
UNDERSTOOD ?

08:44.824 --> 08:47.827
AND SPECIAL OPs HAS
RE-CONNED THE TARGET FOR YOU.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.431
WHY AM I WASTING MY TIME
WITH THIS BULLSHIT ?

08:54.800 --> 08:58.371
WE GOT GUNS IN PRACTICALLY
EVERY THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.

08:58.437 --> 09:01.407
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THESE ?

09:01.474 --> 09:05.278
I NEED THOSE GUNS OFF
THE STREET, CHAPEL.

09:05.344 --> 09:09.982
THAT ORDNANCE
IS TRACEABLE TO<i> ME.</i>

09:15.554 --> 09:19.725
CHAPEL, DID YOU
HEAR WHAT I SAID ?

09:19.792 --> 09:21.193
TONIGHT.

09:23.262 --> 09:26.365
( chatter )

09:36.676 --> 09:38.344
( cocking gun )

09:40.947 --> 09:43.449
( screams )

09:58.564 --> 10:00.199
AHH !

10:02.868 --> 10:04.203
ALRIGHT.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.973
NOW THAT I HAVE
EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION,

10:07.039 --> 10:10.943
LET'S GET THIS OVER
WITH REAL QUICK, OKAY ?

10:11.010 --> 10:14.380
THERE WERE WEAPONS
FIRED IN THIS ALLEY.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.482
THEY LOOK
LIKE THIS.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.251
ONE WAS A SHOULDER
FIRED MISSILE.

10:19.318 --> 10:20.953
IT MAKES A BIG NOISE.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.255
I'M SURE YOU
WOULD REMEMBER IT.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.224
TELL ME WHERE
THEY ARE

10:25.291 --> 10:27.393
OR I'LL PUT YOU
WORTHLESS PIECES OF SHIT

10:27.460 --> 10:29.095
OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.997
I DON'T KNOW.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.833
NO, I THINK YOU'RE
SMART, OLD FART.

10:33.899 --> 10:38.304
NOW LET'S JUST SEE HOW
HIGH THAT I.Q. OF YOURS IS.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.707

THE GUNS ARE.

10:45.077 --> 10:49.115

10:49.181 --> 10:51.384
MAYBE AL.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.152
AL ?

10:53.219 --> 10:56.722
IS AL THE GUY WHO KNOWS

10:56.789 --> 10:59.658

11:05.131 --> 11:06.766
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SPEAK UP

11:06.832 --> 11:08.601
IF YOU WANT
TO BE HEARD.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.972
( Al )
JESUS... JUST A KID.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.174
I NEVER THOUGHT THIS JOB
WOULD COME TO THIS.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.475
( mumbling )

11:16.542 --> 11:17.877
WHAT ?

11:17.943 --> 11:19.278
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SPEAK UP KID,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.447
IF YOU WANT
TO BE HEARD.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.883
( rambling )

11:27.019 --> 11:30.222
IT'S NOT JUST A JOB,
IT'S AN ADVENTURE.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.382
( Chapel )
OH, AL...

11:58.117 --> 11:59.251
( father )
NIGHT, ANGEL.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.186
( mother )
'NIGHT.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.720
'NIGHT.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.461
EVERY NIGHT YOU
PUT CYAN ASLEEP

12:08.527 --> 12:10.029
AND THEN YOU GO BACK
TO THE AGENCY.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.630
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

12:11.697 --> 12:13.365
I WANT TO KEEP
YOU SAFE, BABY.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.268
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
"CLOAK AND DAGGER" STUFF.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.671
YOU'RE A DESK JOCKEY,
A NICE SAFE JOB.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.273
I LIKE KNOWING I WON'T GET
A PHONE CALL IN THE NIGHT

12:21.340 --> 12:23.242
SAYING YOU'RE
MISSING OR DEAD.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.977
I THINK
I FOUND SOMETHING

12:25.044 --> 12:26.745
THAT THEY DIDN'T
WANT ME TO FIND.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.448
SOMETIMES
THERE'S AN AGENCY
INSIDE THE AGENCY

12:29.515 --> 12:31.050
KEEPING A LOT
OF SECRETS,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.952
BUT I'LL GET IT
ALL STRAIGHTENED OUT.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.387
I GOTTA GO.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.694
BE CAREFUL.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.383
WANDA ?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.785
I FORGOT
SOMETHING.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.259
I LOVE YOU.

13:13.325 --> 13:14.760
I LOVE YOU, TERRY.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.762

13:45.391 --> 13:47.293

13:47.359 --> 13:50.763
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW !

13:57.303 --> 13:59.205
( glass breaking )

13:59.271 --> 14:02.441
LOOK AT THAT,
BROKEN GLASS.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.777
GOOD AS A SCALPEL.

14:04.843 --> 14:07.112
( mumbling )

14:10.950 --> 14:14.253
THE GUNS,
OUR GUNS, AMOS.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.722
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE PROTECTING
THE FAMILY JEWELS.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.258
BUT HEY, I COULD
CUT THOSE OFF TOO.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.129
WELL, WHAT

14:30.069 --> 14:33.272
AL... AL ?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.408

14:36.475 --> 14:40.946
WHAT IS THIS GAY PRIDE DAY

14:41.013 --> 14:42.715
HEY, I LIKE
THE MASK,

14:42.781 --> 14:45.684
BUT I THINK THE CAPE
IS A LITTLE MUCH.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.339
HOW THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT ?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.808
STAND UP AND
I'LL SHOW YOU.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.380
SON-OF-A-BITCH !

15:19.818 --> 15:21.687

I REMEMBER YOU.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.892
IT'S OKAY, AMOS,
I GOT YOU.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.172
WHAT THE FUCK ?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.475

16:18.243 --> 16:20.546
SAY WHAT ?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.185
( Spawn )
THAT'S WHERE
THE STATE PRISON IS,

16:26.251 --> 16:28.420
WHERE YOU
WERE BORN.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.993
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ?

16:40.399 --> 16:44.837
YOUR WORST
FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.584
SAY IT.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.388
AL ?

17:02.454 --> 17:05.791
YEAH, WE KNOW EACH
OTHER REAL WELL.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.360
