Technically, no.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.985

12:31.042 --> 12:32.322
Did one of you idiotsdo somethi?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.242
I already told you, he never.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.373
Is my brother dead, Hammond?

12:41.636 --> 12:44.220
No, and I can prove it.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.638
How?

12:45.682 --> 12:47.474
He texted me last night.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.893
That's bulllshit.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.256
See for yourself. Phone's right.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.824
My brother didn'ttype that mes.

13:04.868 --> 13:05.533
You sent that to yourself, di?

13:05.577 --> 13:07.368
Why would I do that?

13:07.412 --> 13:08.912
Alibi maybe?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.164
Sleep disappearedbefore Tom wa.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.042
So what motivationwould any of?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.003
I don't know.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.713
But I'm about to find out.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.803
What the hell is this? Hey!

13:24.846 --> 13:25.846
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

13:29.434 --> 13:31.017
What are you doing?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.136
I'm getting answers the smar.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.578
Get in here.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.499
What's going on?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.877
Have the Ravenshad any contactp

13:57.921 --> 13:59.201
since you've beenassigned to th?

13:59.923 --> 14:01.203
No, like I told you, he never.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.173
But according to your re,

14:02.217 --> 14:03.217
you met with his brother.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.261
A man they call Neckbone. Yeah.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.637
Why?-What did he want?

14:07.681 --> 14:09.138
He was looking for his brother.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.850
It's all there in front of you..

14:11.893 --> 14:13.213
So Hammond nevertalked to Slee?

14:14.479 --> 14:17.105
Not that I'm aware of.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.523
Because Sleep sent hima text l.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.525
You have Sleep's phone records.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.985
Yes, of course we do.

14:23.905 --> 14:24.445
You sure you're not being pl?

14:24.489 --> 14:25.989
I don't think so.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.534
He doesn't think so.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.578
I'll lean on Hammond.

14:31.872 --> 14:32.620
Find out whatthe text was about.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.289
Damon, if Hammond is lying

14:34.332 --> 14:34.914
about being incontact with Slee,

14:34.958 --> 14:37.000
I want to know why.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.753
I'm real close torearre.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.839
You have yourself a short runway

14:42.883 --> 14:44.549
to get thingsback under control.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.092
Do you understand me?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.218
I understand, sir.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.012
Is there anything else we ne?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.089
Nothing significant to report.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.565
Okay, get some sleep.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.410
Tell me your name.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.079
Steve Hammond.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.123
Did you kill?

15:19.628 --> 15:20.752
No.-

15:20.795 --> 15:22.003
Did a Raven kill Sleep?

15:25.216 --> 15:26.466
No.

15:28.053 --> 15:31.971
Well, get to it, man. Ask him i.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.015
Was Sleep, to yourknowledge, m?

15:40.190 --> 15:41.190
No.

15:45.028 --> 15:45.860
He's telling.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.696
You sure this thing's working?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.009
I mean, he's a copwhich means h.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.785
In a situation withthis ki,

15:53.828 --> 15:55.912
there's no wayhe could fool it.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.164
I already told you. We know not.

15:58.208 --> 16:02.126
So, now what? You gonna apologi?

16:02.170 --> 16:06.047
No.-You ever think maybe Sleep?

16:06.091 --> 16:07.632
Well, if he isn't dead, then?

16:07.676 --> 16:09.092
Witness Protection.-And how yo?

16:09.135 --> 16:12.637
If they picked him up beforehe,

16:12.681 --> 16:13.721
they probably flipped him.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.724
And that's probablywhy he's texe

16:16.768 --> 16:18.017
he was supposed to meet with.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.978
Trying to set us up to get out.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.815
My brother's a lot of things...

16:23.858 --> 16:25.138
but an informantisn't one of 'e.

16:28.697 --> 16:29.777
Everything's back in place.

16:29.990 --> 16:30.947
When you get somemore informatin

16:30.991 --> 16:33.574
on that WMD drugor who's moving,

16:33.618 --> 16:35.034
I want to hear about it.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.995
What about Tom?-What about him?

16:41.584 --> 16:42.584
Your rent's going up.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.172
You okay, Steve?

16:48.216 --> 16:49.216
No.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.964
How the hell didhe beat a poly?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.771
State of mind.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.096
Technically, we didn't kill him.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.401
The fall did.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.079
I see Cole.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.999
I see Ramos. I see Bitch.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.002
Did you kill Sleep, Steve?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.008
Did a Raven kill Sleep?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.979
Was Sleep, to yourknowledge, mu?

18:13.384 --> 18:16.469

They're acting likethey're on t.

Besides...

19:10.650 --> 19:11.983
my garden's gone to shit.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.611
What's bothering you?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.072
I know there's something.

19:18.116 --> 19:22.034
The Feds have you on tapecashi.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.833
So if anybody comes by, you nee.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.097
Have you visitedyour father yet?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.986
No.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.990
Can you do it?

20:05.288 --> 20:06.996
For me?

20:17.425 --> 20:19.300
Yeah.-

20:19.344 --> 20:20.344
Thank you.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.237
Hey!

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
Daddy!

20:43.576 --> 20:44.867
I missed you so much.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.370
You know how much I missed you?

20:47.413 --> 20:48.120
Where have you been?

20:48.164 --> 20:48.996
I've been at work, baby.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.283
Veronica, can yougo upstairs, ?

Love you.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.426
Love you, too!

21:02.470 --> 21:04.595
You look nice.

21:04.639 --> 21:05.346
You know, I don't thinkit's a a

21:05.390 --> 21:07.932
you showing up like this.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.726
It's my house.-Yeah, it's our.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.937
And until we figure this out,

21:12.981 --> 21:14.605
I don't want to confuse her. A.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.399
But I mean... I miss her.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.027
She misses you.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.196
But... I don't want you drivin.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.032
Why?

21:25.076 --> 21:27.201
Because I was rethinkingthing,

21:27.245 --> 21:28.828
and I was gonna call youand I w,

21:28.871 --> 21:30.015
and maybe even ask you to come.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.666
And then, I foundsome cash in y.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.626
It's money from a side job!

21:35.670 --> 21:37.211
Side job? It was $5,000!

21:37.255 --> 21:40.131
Okay, yes, but please just he?

21:40.174 --> 21:41.402
I don't want to havethis conver!

21:41.426 --> 21:42.216
I'm working with the Fedsto hen

21:42.260 --> 21:44.885

21:44.929 --> 21:46.073
You're lying!-I'm not lying! I!

21:46.097 --> 21:47.377
I put that on ourdaughter's lif!

21:48.641 --> 21:49.974
Don't you dare do that!

21:50.018 --> 21:51.434
Don't you dare swearon Veronica.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.060
Don't you dare.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.384
It's what people dowhen they're.

21:57.525 --> 21:58.627
I just want my family back.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.984
Well, I want the manl thought.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.781
So it looks like right now...

22:05.825 --> 22:07.025
neither of usget what we want.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.001
My God.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.553
What good is this doing?

22:27.597 --> 22:30.097
More than you think.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.224
We all internalize pain from ou.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.185
It needs to be processed.

22:34.228 --> 22:38.439
Otherwise, we're at the mercyof,

22:38.483 --> 22:40.399
and can't control.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.734
You know that complaint?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.819
The one that landed me in here,

22:43.863 --> 22:45.143
the one that'sunder investigati?

22:46.824 --> 22:48.064
You know whatthat dirt bag did?

22:49.535 --> 22:50.993
Raped his own child.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.372
She was six.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.667
It's understandable thatcould.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.753
But you're deflecting again.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.421
We're looking earlier than that.

23:02.465 --> 23:03.465
For the source.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.009
So, you want my childhood?

23:08.262 --> 23:09.095
Okay.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.597
My father...

23:11.641 --> 23:13.057
We'll just call him that

23:13.101 --> 23:15.643
being how he's the one whoshot.

23:15.686 --> 23:16.977
He left before I was born.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.817
And my mother is oneof those mon

23:22.860 --> 23:23.609
who can't seemto get through a y

23:23.653 --> 23:25.236
without a man by her side.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.987
Any man.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.573
How many?

23:29.617 --> 23:31.992
I don't know. I didn't count.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.248
A lot.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.333
Any abusers?

23:39.377 --> 23:41.001
Pedophiles?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.800
Is your mother still alive?

23:53.474 --> 23:55.975
Last I checked.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.338
You don't have much contact wi?

24:00.356 --> 24:01.356
Would you?

24:25.173 --> 24:27.298
You think they know we h?

24:27.341 --> 24:29.425
'Cause they didn't pulla big nu.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.051
I don't know.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.762
But we can't go intothe pension.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.097
It'll raise too many red flags.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.016
Is he gonna throw in?

24:39.187 --> 24:41.687
I sank most of my money into p.

24:41.731 --> 24:42.980
Let's just grab what's left.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.857
We'll pool our money. Figure it.

24:44.901 --> 24:45.441
We're really gonnapay this ass?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.942
We got no choice.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.029
Unless Byrd finds that phone.

24:50.072 --> 24:53.282
I'm trying.-If you could've do.

24:53.326 --> 24:57.203
You're throwing in.-I'm not get.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.852

and I can tell you...

27:53.547 --> 27:54.838
they never end well.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.548
And when there'sfamilies involv,
