WEBVTT

00:06.894 --> 00:08.378
Paige: ONCE UPON A TIMETHERE LIVED
A HANDSOME PRINCE

00:08.478 --> 00:10.046
WHO WAS ABOUT TO MARRY
A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN,

00:10.146 --> 00:12.965
BUT AN EVIL ENCHANTRESS
WITH DARK POWERS

00:13.065 --> 00:15.383
WANTED THE PRINCE
FOR HERSELF

00:15.483 --> 00:17.317
SO SHE COULD BECOME QUEEN
AND RULE THE ENTIRE KINGDOM.

00:17.693 --> 00:20.930
I HATE HER.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.556
REALLY?

00:22.656 --> 00:23.598
I ALWAYS
KIND OF RELATED TO HER.

00:23.698 --> 00:25.224
LIKE I SAID,
I LOVE HER.

00:25.324 --> 00:28.225
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

00:28.325 --> 00:30.620
WELL,
IN ORDER TO PULL OFF
THAT KIND OF MAGIC,

00:31.328 --> 00:35.024
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS
HAD TO WAIT FOR A SIGN

00:35.124 --> 00:37.025
THAT HER POWERS
WERE AT THEIR DARKEST.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.986
A SIGN?

00:39.086 --> 00:40.154
MM-HMM.
SEE IN THE STARS?

00:40.254 --> 00:43.072
SEE THE PRINCE...

00:43.172 --> 00:44.906
HIS SWORD...

00:45.006 --> 00:46.366
AND THE 3 STARS
THAT FORM HIS CROWN?

00:46.466 --> 00:49.202
WELL, ONCE
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS
SAW THE SIGN,

00:49.302 --> 00:51.243
SHE LOCKED AWAY
THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN

00:51.343 --> 00:53.413
AND CAST A SPELL
ON THE UNSUSPECTING
PRINCE.

00:53.513 --> 00:57.041
"BRING TOGETHER
MY PRINCE AND ME.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.960
"LET HIM FALL
ON BENDED KNEE.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.420
I SUMMON--"

01:02.520 --> 01:05.254
"I SUMMON--"

01:05.354 --> 01:07.507
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER
THE END OF IT.

01:07.607 --> 01:10.342
LET ME GUESS.

01:10.442 --> 01:11.647
THE PRINCE DEFEATS
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS.

01:11.657 --> 01:15.262
HE MARRIED
THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN,

01:15.362 --> 01:16.514
AND THEY LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER, RIGHT?

01:16.614 --> 01:18.265
MM-MMM.

01:18.365 --> 01:19.265
ACTUALLY,

01:19.365 --> 01:20.977
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS
BORE AN HEIR,

01:21.077 --> 01:23.187
KILLED THE PRINCE,

01:23.288 --> 01:24.188
AND RULED
THE KINGDOM FOREVER.

01:24.288 --> 01:26.522
WHAT KIND OF FAIRY TALE
IS THAT?

01:26.622 --> 01:28.733
IT'S JUST ONE THAT'S
KIND OF STAYED WITH ME

01:28.833 --> 01:32.068
FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER.

01:32.168 --> 01:34.905
I TOLD YOU
I WAS A WEIRD KID.

01:35.005 --> 01:36.279
I NEED TO GET YOU
OUT MORE, PAIGE.

01:36.379 --> 01:39.074
BE EASIER IF YOU WERE
AROUND MORE, GLEN.

01:39.174 --> 01:42.218
I'M AROUND NOW.

02:05.904 --> 02:09.305
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

02:09.405 --> 02:11.015
HOW DARE YOU
SUMMON ME.

02:11.116 --> 02:12.475
FORGIVE ME
FOR INCONVENIENCING YOU

02:12.575 --> 02:14.519
AT THIS LATE HOUR,
LADY JULIA.

02:14.619 --> 02:16.353
ALAS, I HAD
NO OTHER CHOICE.

02:16.453 --> 02:19.272
THE STARS HAVE ALIGNED.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.900
YOU DON'T FRIGHTEN ME,
ENCHANTRESS.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.193
THE STARS
ARE ON THE SIDE
OF GOOD, NOT EVIL.

02:24.293 --> 02:26.903
TOMORROW
MY PRINCE AND I
WILL MARRY,

02:27.004 --> 02:28.738
AND THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU COULD DO
TO STOP THAT.

02:28.838 --> 02:31.322
HE LOVES ME, NOT YOU.

02:31.422 --> 02:33.759
DARK MAGIC CAN CHANGE THAT.

02:47.186 --> 02:50.521
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

02:50.730 --> 02:51.940
BECAUSE THIS IS MY DESTINY,
NOT YOURS.

04:52.533 --> 04:55.686
LOOK AT ME.

04:55.786 --> 04:57.647
I LOOK
LIKE A DROWNED RAT.

04:57.747 --> 04:59.398
I NEED
MY BLOW DRYER.

04:59.498 --> 05:00.815
PRETEND YOU'RE CAMPING.

05:00.915 --> 05:02.067
I HATE CAMPING.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.109
WELL, I HATE
INSTANT COFFEE,

05:03.209 --> 05:04.903
BUT I'M DRINKING IT,
AREN'T I?

05:05.003 --> 05:06.444
WE CAN'T KEEP LIVING
WITH NO ELECTRICITY.

05:06.544 --> 05:08.948
IT'S MEDIEVAL.

05:09.048 --> 05:10.282
AT LEAST
WE'RE CONSERVING ENERGY.

05:10.382 --> 05:11.866
WELL,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

05:11.966 --> 05:13.659
WHEN THE SHOCKER DEMON'S
GONNA ATTACK NEXT,
AND FAST.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.119
BUT WE STILL NEED
THE POWER OF THREE
TO VANQUISH HIM,

05:16.219 --> 05:18.721
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
NUMBER 3 LIVES ACROSS TOWN.

05:20.348 --> 05:21.348
I AM GOING
TO CALL HER.

05:23.683 --> 05:25.336
NOT THE CORDLESS!

05:25.436 --> 05:26.686
AAH!

05:50.080 --> 05:53.233
YOU OK?

05:53.333 --> 05:54.582
NO, I AM NOT OK.
OW, OW, OW.

05:54.792 --> 05:58.485
THIS IS SO CRAZY.
WE HAVE TO CALL PAIGE

05:58.585 --> 06:02.240
AND SET UP A TIME
WHERE SHE CAN COME OVER AND--

06:02.340 --> 06:04.825
PHOEBE, WE CAN'T
SCHEDULE VANQUISHES, OK?

06:04.925 --> 06:07.885
DEMON ATTACKS
DON'T USUALLY FIT
INTO THE DAY PLANNERS.

06:08.052 --> 06:11.595
OK, THEN
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

06:12.263 --> 06:14.224
I SUGGEST THAT MAYBE
PAIGE MOVE IN WITH US.

06:20.812 --> 06:23.923
WAIT.

06:24.023 --> 06:25.966
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

06:26.066 --> 06:27.692
WELL, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO
SOONER OR LATER, ISN'T SHE?

06:27.984 --> 06:31.511
I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

06:31.611 --> 06:34.513
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
ARE ACTUALLY SUGGESTING IT.

06:34.613 --> 06:38.268
I AM JUST TRYING
TO BE PRACTICAL.

06:38.368 --> 06:40.978
BESIDES,
I AM SICK AND TIRED

06:41.078 --> 06:43.147
OF LEO WATCHING OVER HER
DAY AND NIGHT

06:43.247 --> 06:45.231
PROTECTING HER
FROM VARIOUS DEMONS.

06:45.331 --> 06:47.523
YOU--I WOULD
ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE
MY HUSBAND AGAIN.

06:47.623 --> 06:50.694
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:50.794 --> 06:52.627
BUT, STILL,
THAT'S A HUGE DECISION.

06:53.255 --> 06:55.506
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE READY FOR THAT?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.159
ALL I KNOW
IS THAT EVERY DEMON

06:58.259 --> 07:00.368
WHO IS OUT TO IMPRESS
THE SOURCE IS ATTACKING US.

07:00.468 --> 07:02.745
WHICH MEANS WE ALL NEED
TO BE UNDER ONE ROOF.

07:02.845 --> 07:05.205
OTHERWISE,
WE'RE TOO VULNERABLE.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.539
I DIDN'T MEAN
ARE WE READY AS WITCHES.

07:07.639 --> 07:10.935
I MEANT ARE WE READY
AS SISTERS?

07:13.186 --> 07:14.644
WHAT IF WE DON'T GET ALONG?

07:16.646 --> 07:17.882
WE DIDN'T ALWAYS
GET ALONG WITH PRUE,
EITHER.

07:17.982 --> 07:19.716
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT.

07:19.817 --> 07:21.926
WE GREW UP WITH HER.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.027
EVENTUALLY
WE HAD TO GET ALONG.

07:23.319 --> 07:24.988
I STILL HALF EXPECT TO SEE HER
WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.950
MAYBE IT'S JUST TOO SOON.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.660
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

07:40.875 --> 07:44.568
OH, MY GOD! IT'S 9:00.
I AM SO SCREWED!

07:44.668 --> 07:47.570
MMM.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.572
CAN'T YOU JUST
BE A LITTLE LATE?

07:49.672 --> 07:51.573
I'M ALREADY
A LITTLE LATE.

07:51.674 --> 07:53.659
CAN'T YOU BE A LOT LATE?

07:53.759 --> 07:57.597
ESPECIALLY SEEING
AS HOW I'M LEAVING TOMORROW?

07:58.679 --> 08:02.250
YOU'RE ALWAYS
LEAVING TOMORROW, GLEN.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.684
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

08:10.064 --> 08:13.175
WHAT?

08:13.275 --> 08:15.469
9:00-5:00
ISN'T YOU, PAIGE.

08:15.569 --> 08:17.304
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
TOO ADVENTUROUS
A SPIRIT

08:17.404 --> 08:19.931
TO BE PINNED DOWN.

08:20.031 --> 08:21.597
OH, YEAH?
JUST DROP BY BETWEEN K-2
AND THE GREAT BARRIER REEF

08:21.697 --> 08:25.102
AND YOU KNOW THIS
ABOUT ME, DO YOU?

08:25.202 --> 08:27.603
YOUR LIFE
COULD BE A FAIRY TALE,

08:27.703 --> 08:29.687
AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO END BADLY.

08:29.787 --> 08:31.605
WHO SAYS
IT'S GOING TO?

08:31.705 --> 08:33.606
COME TO AUSTRALIA
WITH ME, PAIGE,

08:33.707 --> 08:36.361
JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT.
WHY NOT?

08:36.461 --> 08:38.195
BECAUSE
I'VE GOT TOO MANY
RESPONSIBILITIES,

08:38.294 --> 08:40.947
THAT'S WHY NOT.

08:41.047 --> 08:42.365
YOU'RE 25 YEARS OLD.

08:42.465 --> 08:44.615
YOU'VE GOT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU

08:44.715 --> 08:46.284
FOR THAT KIND OF CRAP.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.286
JUST GO FOR IT.
DUMP YOUR JOB

08:48.386 --> 08:49.995
AND HAVE FUN WITH ME.

08:50.095 --> 08:51.621
AS TEMPTING AS THAT SOUNDS,

08:51.721 --> 08:54.041
I ACTUALLY HAVE THINGS
CALLED RESPONSIBILITIES.

08:54.141 --> 08:57.335
IT'S NOT JUST MY JOB.

08:57.435 --> 08:59.728
I'VE GOT SISTERS NOW,
AND I'VE JUST GOT...

09:00.728 --> 09:04.090
STUFF WE'VE GOT TO DO.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.467
WHAT STUFF?

09:06.567 --> 09:08.734
STUFF THAT KEEPS ME
PINNED DOWN.

09:11.905 --> 09:15.115
IS THAT A GOOD THING
OR A BAD THING?

09:16.158 --> 09:19.620
I'M NOT SURE YET.

09:31.295 --> 09:34.614
OH, SORRY.
HI.

09:34.714 --> 09:35.781
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

09:35.881 --> 09:36.866
WHAT'S UP?

09:36.966 --> 09:38.200
HOW ABOUT A KISS FOR
YOUR LONG-LOST WIFE, HUH?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.658
OH, RIGHT.
OH, SWEET.

09:39.758 --> 09:42.328
HI.

09:42.429 --> 09:43.329
WELL, UH, BYE.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.831
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "BYE"?
WE JUST GOT HERE.

09:45.931 --> 09:48.500
RIGHT,
WELL, YOU KNOW,

09:48.600 --> 09:49.666
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE PAIGE
UNPROTECTED.

09:49.766 --> 09:51.628
UH-HUH.
IS SHE HOME?

09:51.728 --> 09:53.670
YEAH, SHE'S HOME.
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE,
UH...

09:53.770 --> 09:56.882
INDISPOSED
AT THE MOMENT.

09:56.982 --> 09:59.192
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU WATCH?

10:00.443 --> 10:02.845
WHAT ARE YOU?
LIKE, A PEEPING ANGEL?

10:02.945 --> 10:05.263
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING!

10:05.364 --> 10:06.514
UH-HUH.

10:06.615 --> 10:07.640
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
JUST A LITTLE,

10:07.740 --> 10:08.782
BUT HOW ELSE AM I
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER?

10:10.409 --> 10:13.686
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
CAN'T SEE A THING!

10:13.786 --> 10:16.564
PHOEBE!

10:16.664 --> 10:18.149
PIPER, LEO,
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

10:18.249 --> 10:20.483
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD,
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
BELIEVE ME.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.320
WHOA.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.905
WHO ARE THEY?

10:26.005 --> 10:27.323
THE SOON-TO-BE EX-SISTERS
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

10:27.423 --> 10:29.866
OK, WE'RE SORRY,

10:29.966 --> 10:31.699
BUT YOU KNOW,
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHICH WAY TO TURN,

10:31.799 --> 10:34.494
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

10:34.594 --> 10:35.495
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

10:35.595 --> 10:37.664
OH, UH...
[CLEARS THROAT] HERE.

10:37.764 --> 10:40.458
THANKS.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.543
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS, GLEN.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.169
THIS IS HORRIBLY
EMBARRASSING.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.710
NO WORRIES.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.016
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT
SOME...RESPONSIBILITIES.

10:47.026 --> 10:50.399
PLANE LEAVES TOMORROW.

10:51.024 --> 10:54.485
PLANE? WHAT PLANE?

10:54.777 --> 10:58.347
NEVER MIND.
THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

10:58.447 --> 11:01.098
I CAN'T USE
MY BLOW DRYER.

11:01.198 --> 11:02.724
SO HAVE YOU BEEN ATTACKED
BY THE SHOCKER DEMON YET?

11:02.824 --> 11:05.436
NO, SHE HASN'T.

11:05.536 --> 11:06.604
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

11:06.704 --> 11:07.728
OH, BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN WATCHING YOU

11:07.829 --> 11:09.147
FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

11:09.247 --> 11:11.398
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME?!

11:11.498 --> 11:13.150
WELL, I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.235
AT LEAST NOTHING
VERY INTERESTING.

11:14.335 --> 11:15.569
[PIPER, SARCASTICALLY] RIGHT.
THAT'S IT. OUT!

11:15.669 --> 11:17.278
BUT--BUT--BUT
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU

11:17.378 --> 11:19.697
ABOUT THE SHOCKER DEMON,
BECAUSE--

11:19.797 --> 11:20.739
OUT!
Phoebe:
WE CAN'T VANQUISH THEM

11:20.839 --> 11:21.782
WITHOUT
THE POWER OF THREE.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.907
AND YOU'RE
NOT AT THE MANOR,
SO--

11:23.007 --> 11:24.033
OUT!

11:24.133 --> 11:25.217
I THINK
THAT WENT FAIRLY WELL.

11:27.011 --> 11:29.037
UNBELIEVABLE.

11:29.137 --> 11:32.249
WHERE IS SHE?

11:32.349 --> 11:33.375
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO MY BELOVED?

11:33.475 --> 11:34.833
YOU MEAN I'M
NOT YOUR BELOVED?

11:34.933 --> 11:36.934
OOH, I'M CRUSHED.

11:37.851 --> 11:39.646
YOUR DARK MAGIC DOESN'T
SCARE ME, ENCHANTRESS.

11:41.773 --> 11:44.508
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS

11:44.608 --> 11:46.093
AND I JUST MIGHT
SPARE YOUR LIFE.

11:46.193 --> 11:48.219
VERY WELL.

11:48.319 --> 11:49.987
YOUR BELOVED IS
RIGHT HERE, MY PRINCE.

11:51.155 --> 11:53.864
RIGHT BEFORE
YOUR VERY EYES.

11:56.159 --> 11:59.645
BRING TOGETHER
MY PRINCE AND ME.

11:59.745 --> 12:01.647
LET HIM FALL
ON BENDED KNEE.

12:01.747 --> 12:04.274
I SUMMON HIM
TO MY SIDE

12:04.374 --> 12:07.084
THAT HE MAY TAKE ME TO
BE HIS DESTINED BRIDE.

12:12.879 --> 12:15.965
MY LOVE.

12:19.302 --> 12:22.805
I AM FOREVER YOURS.

12:26.850 --> 12:30.085
AS WILL BE YOUR KINGDOM

12:30.185 --> 12:32.894
ONCE I CONCEIVE AN HEIR.

12:38.899 --> 12:42.095
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:42.195 --> 12:44.781
ALL RIGHT! CALM DOWN!

12:45.905 --> 12:47.157
AT LEAST I KNOCKED.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.727
OH.

12:50.827 --> 12:51.809
HEY, PAIGE.

12:51.909 --> 12:52.894
I'M NOT HERE TO TALK
TO EITHER OF YOU.

12:52.994 --> 12:54.521
I'M JUST HERE
TO LOOK AT
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS.

12:54.621 --> 12:56.813
HEY. HEY, WE SAID
WE WERE SORRY.

12:56.913 --> 12:58.316
Paige:
YEAH, RIGHT.

12:58.416 --> 12:59.650
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH US?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.918
EXCUSE ME?

13:02.918 --> 13:04.237
WELL,
THAT'S WHAT WE CAME
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.614
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TIRED
OF GETTING ATTACKED
BY DEMONS HERE

13:06.714 --> 13:08.742
AND NOT BEING ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

13:08.842 --> 13:10.824
YEAH, BUT WE COULD
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
IF WE WERE TOGETHER.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.244
YOU KNOW, IF WE
LIVED TOGETHER,

13:13.344 --> 13:14.827
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
WE'RE THE STRONGEST.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.830
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.141
ARE YOU TWO OUT
OF YOUR FREAKING MINDS?

13:20.851 --> 13:22.476
DON'T PEOPLE USUALLY
STORM OUT OF THE HOUSE

13:24.603 --> 13:27.105
WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY?

13:30.940 --> 13:34.762
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GOING TO CONSIDER THIS?

13:34.862 --> 13:36.929
NO.

13:37.029 --> 13:37.929
WHY NOT?

13:38.030 --> 13:39.139
BECAUSE IF IT WAS
THAT EASY FOR YOU GUYS

13:39.239 --> 13:40.848
TO BARGE INTO MY ROOM
ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN,

13:40.948 --> 13:42.351
IMAGINE HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
IF I ACTUALLY LIVED HERE.

13:42.451 --> 13:45.102
OK, COULD YOU STOP
LOOKING AT THE BOOK
FOR A SECOND?

13:45.202 --> 13:48.063
NO. IT'S MY BOOK, TOO.

13:48.163 --> 13:50.248
IF YOU LIVED HERE,
YOU COULD LOOK AT IT
ALL THE TIME.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.195
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GUYS
ARE ASKING ME.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.863
I REALLY, REALLY DO.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.863
IT'S JUST...

14:00.964 --> 14:02.211
I DON'T WANT BEING A WITCH
TO TAKE OVER MY LIFE.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.867
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY.

14:04.967 --> 14:07.869
I KNOW IT IS, PAIGE,

14:07.969 --> 14:09.372
AND BELIEVE ME,
I FREAKED OUT IN
THE BEGINNING, TOO,

14:09.472 --> 14:12.248
BUT I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

14:12.348 --> 14:13.958
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

14:14.058 --> 14:15.460
WHY NOT? AREN'T YOU
THE ONE WHO TOLD ME

14:15.560 --> 14:17.462
I SHOULD FIGHT LIKE HELL
TO KEEP MY LIFE SEPARATE
FROM MAGIC?

14:17.562 --> 14:19.755
UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK OUT THAT WAY.

14:19.855 --> 14:22.423
WELL, MAYBE IT WOULD
IF I DIDN'T LIVE HERE.

14:22.523 --> 14:24.966
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THE SHOCKER DEMON SPELL,

14:25.066 --> 14:26.803
WE ALREADY FOUND IT.

14:26.903 --> 14:28.011
I'M NOT. I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

14:28.111 --> 14:30.054
WHAT?

14:30.154 --> 14:31.389
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT
WANT TO SHARE A BATHROOM,

14:31.490 --> 14:34.492
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO THAT BOOK, IT
CONCERNS ALL OF US.

14:34.990 --> 14:37.160
BESIDES THAT,
MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

14:39.994 --> 14:41.748
OK. I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

14:43.916 --> 14:46.900
I INVENTED THIS HORRIBLE
LITTLE FAIRY TALE,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.295
AND IT JUST ALWAYS SEEMED
REALLY REAL TO ME.

14:50.002 --> 14:53.365
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

14:53.465 --> 14:54.949
OH, MY GOD!

14:55.049 --> 14:56.325
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS?

14:56.425 --> 14:58.244
THAT'S IT!

14:58.344 --> 14:59.910
THAT'S THE EVIL WITCH,

15:00.010 --> 15:01.204
THE ONE
WHO KILLS THE PRINCE

15:01.304 --> 15:02.831
AFTER HE GETS HER
PREGNANT, OF COURSE.

15:02.931 --> 15:04.123
OF COURSE.

15:04.223 --> 15:05.599
THIS IS THE SPELL.

15:07.015 --> 15:08.292
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

15:08.392 --> 15:09.878
"BRING TOGETHER
MY PRINCE AND ME.

15:09.978 --> 15:11.045
YEAH--
"LET HIM FALL
ON BENDED KNEE.

15:11.145 --> 15:12.672
PAIGE--
"I SUMMON HIM
TO MY SIDE

15:12.772 --> 15:14.089
THAT HE MAY TAKE ME
TO BE HIS DESTINED BRIDE."

15:14.189 --> 15:17.567
I FINALLY
GOT TO FINISH IT.

15:23.028 --> 15:26.156
NO!

15:39.709 --> 15:42.963
MY LOVE.

15:49.509 --> 15:52.951
WHY DO YOU RUN FROM ME?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.288
WHY ARE YOU
CHASING ME?

15:54.388 --> 15:55.496
BECAUSE WE ARE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

15:55.597 --> 15:56.915
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.219
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
KING ARTHUR'S
COURT, BUDDY?

15:58.229 --> 15:59.417
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:59.517 --> 16:00.958
WE'RE MEANT TO CONCEIVE
AN HEIR, MY LOVE.

16:01.058 --> 16:02.002
AAH! STOP
SAYING THAT.

16:02.102 --> 16:03.545
YOU GUYS WANT
SOME PRIVACY?

16:03.645 --> 16:04.671
THIS IS NOT FUNNY!

16:04.771 --> 16:06.062
PLATE!

16:09.064 --> 16:11.966
OHH!

16:12.067 --> 16:13.135
I'M SORRY.
DID I HURT YOU?

16:13.235 --> 16:16.305
YOU COULD NEVER
HURT ME, MY LOVE.

16:16.405 --> 16:19.640
PIPER, DO THAT THING
YOU DO.

16:19.741 --> 16:20.973
I--I DON'T WANT
TO BLOW HIM UP.

16:21.074 --> 16:22.660
WELL, RISK IT.
HE'S USING HIS TONGUE.

16:24.619 --> 16:27.564
THANK GOD
CHIVALRY IS DEAD.

16:27.664 --> 16:29.148
HE IS GETTING
ON MY LAST NERVE.

16:29.248 --> 16:32.108
OK. WELL, HE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF SPELL.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.903
GEE, YA THINK?

16:34.003 --> 16:34.986
IT'S THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS.

16:35.086 --> 16:36.195
SHE CAST A LOVE SPELL
ON HIM.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.113
SO WHY IS SIR LUST-A-LOT
LUSTING AFTER YOU?

16:38.213 --> 16:40.407
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

16:40.507 --> 16:41.991
WELL, BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR DAMN FAIRY TALE

16:42.091 --> 16:43.718
AND IT'S ALIVE AND FROZEN
IN OUR KITCHEN.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.092
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:47.220 --> 16:48.330
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

16:48.430 --> 16:50.122
WAIT. PAIGE,
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

16:50.222 --> 16:53.751
YES, I CAN. I
DON'T LIVE HERE.

16:53.851 --> 16:56.001
[SIGHS]

16:56.101 --> 16:57.002
PAIGE.

16:57.102 --> 16:58.003
WHAT?

16:58.103 --> 16:59.475
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
KEEP RUNNING AWAY
FROM THESE THINGS.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.548
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO TELL YOU.

17:01.648 --> 17:02.966
BEING A WITCH IS
NOT A PART-TIME JOB.

17:03.067 --> 17:05.008
YEAH, WELL, IF I DON'T
LEAVE NOW, I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.094
PAIGE!
THE CHARMED ONES

17:07.194 --> 17:09.095
COME FIRST!

17:09.194 --> 17:10.656
"THE CHARMED ONES
COME FIRST"?

17:11.573 --> 17:13.849
IT ALWAYS WORKED
WHEN PRUE SAID IT.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.077
[CLICKING]

17:20.454 --> 17:24.123
THE VCR. WHO
SET IT TO RECORD?

17:26.792 --> 17:27.377
EEH!
OOH!

17:30.088 --> 17:31.089
OOH!
AAH!

17:46.643 --> 17:49.853
UHHH!

17:50.020 --> 17:51.144
PHOEBE.

17:53.146 --> 17:54.047
I'M OK...I THINK.

17:54.147 --> 17:56.048
WE'VE GOTTA CONVINCE PAIGE
TO MOVE IN WITH US SOON

17:56.148 --> 17:59.051
BEFORE THERE'S NOBODY
LEFT TO MOVE IN WITH.

17:59.151 --> 18:00.887
WELL, I GUESS
WE NEED A NEW TV.

18:00.987 --> 18:03.405
OH. THE PRINCE.

18:06.616 --> 18:10.578
HE'S GONE?
WHAT, DID HE GO BACK
TO FAIRY TALE LAND?

18:12.579 --> 18:13.664
NO SUCH LUCK.
THE BACK DOOR
IS WIDE OPEN.

18:16.374 --> 18:20.086
SO HE PROBABLY
WENT AFTER PAIGE.

18:20.335 --> 18:22.545
HE LEFT?

18:23.588 --> 18:24.906
SO HE'S JUST WANDERING
AROUND IN CHAIN MAIL?

18:25.006 --> 18:27.073
IT'S SAN FRANCISCO.
NOBODY'LL NOTICE.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.074
WELL, SOONER OR LATER,
SOMEONE'S GONNA NOTICE,

18:29.174 --> 18:31.369
AND THE MEDIEVAL TRAIL'S
GONNA LEAD THEM
RIGHT BACK TO US.

18:31.469 --> 18:33.721
ALL RIGHT. YOU TRY
SCRYING FOR HIM, AND
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

18:34.013 --> 18:37.499
I'LL HAVE LEO
OR PAIGE BACK HERE,

18:37.599 --> 18:39.292
AND HOPEFULLY
THE PRINCE WILL FOLLOW.

18:39.392 --> 18:41.084
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
A DIFFERENT APPROACH
WITH HER.

18:41.184 --> 18:43.713
SHE'S NOT GONNA COME
BACK HERE VOLUNTARILY.

18:43.813 --> 18:45.839
NO, I MEAN ABOUT
GETTING HER TO MOVE IN.

18:45.939 --> 18:47.482
MAYBE IT'S TOO SOON
FOR HER, TOO.

18:55.321 --> 18:58.682
Man:
HEY, MORON!

18:58.782 --> 18:59.683
WHAT ARE
YOU DOIN'?

18:59.783 --> 19:01.409
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM
YOU GOT, HUH?

19:03.327 --> 19:05.202
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,
COME ON, ON YOUR WAY.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

19:06.831 --> 19:08.205
SWALLOW AND
YOU'LL NOT SPEAK AGAIN.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.669
NOW, WHAT IS
THIS METALLIC BEAST?

19:14.712 --> 19:17.112
HOW DO YOU
HARNESS ITS POWER?

19:17.212 --> 19:18.489
WHAT?

19:18.589 --> 19:19.674
YOU WILL USE IT
TO TAKE ME TO MY BELOVED

19:20.758 --> 19:22.909
WHERE I FEEL
HER HEART'S PULL.

19:23.009 --> 19:24.553
QUESTIONS?

19:25.511 --> 19:26.537
Lady Julia: I HAVE ONE.

19:26.637 --> 19:28.120
IF GOOD MAGIC
RESCUED MY PRINCE
FROM YOU,

19:28.221 --> 19:31.166
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'LL RETURN?

19:31.266 --> 19:33.335
I DON'T. THAT'S WHY
I PLAN ON FOLLOWING
HIS FOOTSTEPS

19:33.435 --> 19:36.962
AND BRINGING HIM
BACK...

19:37.062 --> 19:38.266
AFTER I DESTROY
THE GOOD MAGIC
THAT INTERVENED,

19:38.276 --> 19:41.299
OF COURSE.

19:41.399 --> 19:42.467
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN?

19:42.567 --> 19:44.651
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

19:45.234 --> 19:47.362
BECAUSE I'M PETTY

19:48.446 --> 19:49.639
AND EVIL
AND VINDICTIVE.

19:49.739 --> 19:52.323
BUT MOST OF ALL...
AND DETERMINED.

19:53.324 --> 19:56.311
I AM THE OBJECT
OF HIS TRUE LOVE.

19:56.411 --> 19:59.145
YOUR SPELL
ONLY APPROPRIATED IT.

19:59.245 --> 20:01.957
KILL ME AND
YOU BREAK THE SPELL.

20:02.624 --> 20:04.959
I KNOW. I KNOW.

20:06.043 --> 20:08.320
[SIGHS]

20:08.420 --> 20:09.988
THAT'S WHY
I NEEDED THIS

20:10.088 --> 20:11.673
FOR MY POTION
TO WORK.

20:16.010 --> 20:19.162
YOU CANNOT
DO THIS.

20:19.262 --> 20:21.163
ONE THING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT ME,
LADY JULIA--

20:21.263 --> 20:24.683
NOBODY TELLS ME
WHAT TO DO.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.381
NOBODY TELLS ME
WHAT TO DO, LEO.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.340
AND BESIDES,
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU
FOR WATCHING OVER ME.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.885
I DESERVE
BETTER THAN THAT,
ESPECIALLY FROM YOU.

20:37.985 --> 20:40.177
WELL, I'M A GUARDIAN,
PAIGE. IT'S WHAT I DO.

20:40.277 --> 20:42.263
ESPECIALLY DURING
TIMES LIKE THIS

20:42.363 --> 20:44.180
WHEN IT'S DANGEROUS
FOR YOU TO BE ALONE.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.599
IT'S A FAIRY TALE,
NOT A HORROR MOVIE.

20:45.699 --> 20:48.183
WELL, UH...
I WAS TALKIN' ABOUT
THE SHOCKER DEMON.

20:48.283 --> 20:51.312
WELL, YEAH,
HE'S NOT HALF AS SCARY

20:51.412 --> 20:53.187
AS PRINCE CHARMING
COMING AFTER ME, THOUGH.

20:53.287 --> 20:55.149
ALL THE MORE REASON WHY
YOU SHOULD BE STAYING
WITH PHOEBE AND PIPER.

20:55.249 --> 20:58.151
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO?
WHAT IF I WANT

20:58.251 --> 21:00.193
TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN OR GO DIVE
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, HUH?

21:00.293 --> 21:03.030
WHAT?

21:03.130 --> 21:04.156
LOOK, I'VE HAD A BLAST
BEING A WITCH.

21:04.256 --> 21:06.116
I LIKE THE SPELLS,
LIKE THE POTIONS.

21:06.217 --> 21:08.118
I'M EVEN GETTING
USED TO ORBING.

21:08.218 --> 21:09.368
BUT, GOD,
I'VE JUST HAD ENOUGH.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.202
WELL, THERE IS
NO "ENOUGH," PAIGE.

21:12.302 --> 21:14.204
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW THAT. WHY
ARE YOU RUNNING FROM IT?

21:14.304 --> 21:17.041
OH, GEE, I DON'T KNOW.
BEING HUNTED
BY THE SOURCE,

21:17.141 --> 21:19.208
DUCKING THE FURIES,
AND BEING SHRUNK
BY A PSYCHO DEMON,

21:19.308 --> 21:22.210
NOT TO MENTION
BEING CHASED AFTER

21:22.310 --> 21:23.879
BY MY BEDTIME STORIES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY

21:23.979 --> 21:26.339
I WOULDN'T WANT
THE REST OF MY LIFE
TO BE JUST LIKE THAT.

21:26.439 --> 21:29.216
YOU'RE NOT ALONE ANYMORE.
YOU HAVE SISTERS NOW.

21:29.316 --> 21:31.385
YEAH, SISTERS WHO
ARE PRESSURING ME
TO MOVE IN WITH THEM

21:31.485 --> 21:33.387
FOR ALL
THE WRONG REASONS.

21:33.487 --> 21:34.805
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

21:34.905 --> 21:36.321
NOTHING.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.641
FORGET ABOUT IT.

21:38.741 --> 21:40.076
LOOK, IT'S JUST
SOMETIMES I FEEL

21:41.077 --> 21:42.226
LIKE THEY WANT ME
TO BE PRUE--
SUPERWITCH.

21:42.326 --> 21:44.438
AND I CAN'T.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

21:44.538 --> 21:47.773
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THEY THINK THAT.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.482
OH, YEAH?
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT
HER ROOM?

21:49.583 --> 21:51.152
IT'S A SHRINE.

21:51.252 --> 21:52.330
NOTHING'S BEEN TOUCHED
SINCE THE DAY SHE DIED.

21:52.340 --> 21:55.196
IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH ACT
TO FOLLOW.

21:55.296 --> 21:57.157
LOOK, DON'T MAKE ME
GO BACK THERE, LEO.

21:57.257 --> 22:00.240
NOT JUST YET. OK?

22:00.340 --> 22:02.302
I JUST
NEED SOME TIME.

22:04.262 --> 22:07.346
I'LL CALL YOU
IF I NEED YOU.

22:11.349 --> 22:14.252
DARRYL.

22:14.352 --> 22:15.462
DARRYL.

22:15.562 --> 22:16.880
DARRYL!

22:16.980 --> 22:18.254
SLOW DOWN.

22:18.354 --> 22:19.351
OK, CARJACKINGS
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

22:19.361 --> 22:21.884
WHY ARE YOU
CALLIN' US?

22:21.984 --> 22:23.442
A GARBAGE TRUCK?

22:24.569 --> 22:26.260
AT SWORD POINT!

22:26.360 --> 22:28.905
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

22:29.823 --> 22:31.283
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THAT THE POLICE
FOUND HIM.

22:32.408 --> 22:34.685
NOT YET.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

22:34.785 --> 22:37.204
NOTHING. I MEAN,
HE'S NOT A WITCH, AND
HE'S NOT A DEMON, SO...

22:38.370 --> 22:41.582
ALL RIGHT. LE...

22:42.749 --> 22:44.167
O.

22:45.878 --> 22:47.277
HI.
HI.

22:47.377 --> 22:49.278
WHERE'S PAIGE?

22:49.379 --> 22:50.279
PAIGE? [SIGHS]

22:50.379 --> 22:51.949
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME.

22:52.049 --> 22:53.550
SHE WHAT?

22:54.926 --> 22:56.036
DID YOU EXPLAIN
THE SITUATION TO HER?

22:56.136 --> 22:58.746
YES.

22:58.846 --> 22:59.747
AND SHE STILL
REFUSED TO COME?

22:59.847 --> 23:01.288
LEO,

23:01.388 --> 23:02.540
WE ARE UP TO
OUR POINTY LITTLE HATS

23:02.640 --> 23:04.125
IN DEMONIC PROBLEMS HERE.
WE NEED HER.
SHE KNOWS THAT.

23:04.225 --> 23:06.292
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE'RE HER SISTERS.

23:06.392 --> 23:09.294
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE REASON YOU NEED HER.

23:09.394 --> 23:11.589
IS THERE MORE TO THAT,
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
LEAVE US HANGIN'?

23:11.689 --> 23:15.299
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

23:15.399 --> 23:17.300
THIS IS
BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

23:17.401 --> 23:19.107
BUT I WILL TELL YOU
THAT JUST WANTING HER
TO BATTLE DEMONS WITH YOU

23:19.117 --> 23:22.723
ISN'T ENOUGH OF A REASON
TO GET HER TO MOVE IN.

23:22.823 --> 23:25.159
IT'S A PRESSING
REASON!

23:25.533 --> 23:26.534
BUT IT'S NOT
A SISTERLY ONE.

23:29.245 --> 23:31.330
LOOK, IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU NEED TO FIND THE PRINCE

23:32.622 --> 23:34.357
BEFORE HE EXPOSES YOU,
SO I SUGGEST

23:34.457 --> 23:36.315
YOU CHECK WITH
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS

23:36.415 --> 23:37.495
AND GET UP TO SPEED
ON PAIGE'S FAIRY TALE.

23:37.505 --> 23:39.628
AND I WILL CHECK
WITH THE ELDERS
AND SEE WHAT THEY KNOW.

23:48.509 --> 23:51.763
[CRASH]

23:59.644 --> 24:03.088
AT LAST.
I FOUND YOU.

24:03.188 --> 24:05.338
HOW?

24:05.438 --> 24:06.507
I FOLLOWED YOUR HEART,
MY LOVE.

24:06.607 --> 24:08.192
OHH.

24:09.441 --> 24:13.344
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW

24:13.445 --> 24:15.556
BEFORE
SECURITY COMES.

24:15.656 --> 24:16.807
I WILL NOT LEAVE
UNTIL YOU ARE WITH CHILD.

24:16.907 --> 24:19.349
OK. A--I ALWAYS
USE PROTECTION,

24:19.449 --> 24:21.451
AND B--YOU'RE
A FAIRY TALE.

24:22.452 --> 24:23.452
I WON'T HARM YOU.

24:25.872 --> 24:27.290
JUST KEEP
THAT SWORD OF YOURS
SHEATHED, PAL.

24:28.124 --> 24:30.377
UHH!

24:33.295 --> 24:36.363
UHH!

24:36.463 --> 24:38.091
UHHH!

24:47.472 --> 24:51.434
FEAR NOT. I'VE SLAIN
THE BEAST, MY LOVE.

24:52.018 --> 24:54.477
YOU MOST
CERTAINLY HAVE.

24:55.478 --> 24:57.131
HEY, PAIGE!

24:57.231 --> 24:58.380
PAIGE,
YOU ALL RIGHT
IN THERE?

24:58.480 --> 25:00.233
I WILL
STAY FOREVER
BY YOUR SIDE.

25:01.275 --> 25:03.136
EVERY MOMENT
OF EVERY DAY,

25:03.236 --> 25:04.928
YOU WOULD KNOW
YOU WERE PROTECTED,

25:05.028 --> 25:06.905
DESIRED, LOVED.

25:07.322 --> 25:08.781
THAT'S SO SWEET.

25:10.490 --> 25:12.059
PAIGE! PAIGE!

25:12.159 --> 25:13.618
PAIGE, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOIN' ON?!

25:15.203 --> 25:16.687
WHO--WHO IS THIS GUY?

25:16.787 --> 25:18.272
UM...RENAISSANCE FAIRE.

25:18.373 --> 25:20.523
YEAH, WE'RE TRYIN'
TO SCORE TICKETS

25:20.623 --> 25:22.108
FOR THE ORPHANAGE.
[CHUCKLES]

25:22.209 --> 25:23.500
SEE YA.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.446
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

25:27.546 --> 25:29.404
YOU'D THINK SHE'D
WANT TO MOVE IN HERE,

25:29.504 --> 25:31.032
CONSIDERING THE DUMP
SHE LIVES IN.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.909
PIPER.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.285
JUST WAIT TILL
THE SHOCKER DEMON
ATTACKS HER.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.036
THEN SHE MIGHT
NOT BE SO RESISTANT
TO THE IDEA.

25:36.136 --> 25:39.039
"DEFIANT, CLEVER,
AND INDEPENDENT."

25:39.139 --> 25:42.207
THAT KINDA DESCRIBES
PAIGE, DON'T YOU THINK?

25:42.307 --> 25:44.517
YEAH, ALONG WITH
STUBBORN, STUBBORN,
AND MORE STUBBORN.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.629
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO THIS.

25:48.729 --> 25:50.147
"A POWERFUL WITCH
WHO CAME TO THE CRAFT LATE,

25:51.356 --> 25:53.423
BUT LEARNED
TO USE IT QUICKLY."

25:53.523 --> 25:55.551
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
THIS IS PAIGE.

25:55.651 --> 25:57.219
WHAT ARE YOU GETTIN' AT?

25:57.319 --> 25:58.720
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A HUGE COINCIDENCE

25:58.820 --> 26:00.764
THAT PAIGE'S FAIRY TALE
JUST HAPPENS TO BE
IN THE BOOK OF SHADOWS

26:00.864 --> 26:03.431
AND THAT THIS PRINCE
JUST HAPPENS TO SHOW UP
IN THE 21st CENTURY

26:03.531 --> 26:07.061
HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH HER?

26:07.161 --> 26:09.145
CONNECT THE DOTS,
WILL YOU?

26:09.245 --> 26:10.437
OK, WHAT IF
IT'S NOT A FAIRY TALE?

26:10.537 --> 26:13.439
WHAT IF IT'S A MEMORY?

26:13.539 --> 26:15.375
PAIGE'S MEMORY
FROM A PAST LIFE?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.127
NOW YOU'RE REACHIN'.

26:18.961 --> 26:20.237
I DON'T THINK SO.
I MEAN,

26:20.337 --> 26:21.875
MY PAST LIFE CAME BACK
TO BITE ME ON THE BUTT.
WHY CAN'T PAIGE'S?

26:21.885 --> 26:24.883
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT IF PAIGE WAS
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS

26:26.468 --> 26:29.577
ONCE UPON A TIME?

26:29.678 --> 26:31.430
BUT...THE ENCHANTRESS'
POWER WAS TO CONJURE
THE ELEMENTS.

26:32.554 --> 26:35.891
PAIGE CAN'T DO THAT.

26:37.934 --> 26:41.229
THIS
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

26:43.439 --> 26:46.508
AAH!
AAH! AAH!

26:46.608 --> 26:48.093
UHH!

26:48.193 --> 26:49.467
PAIGE?!

26:49.567 --> 26:50.970
WHERE IS THE PRINCE?

26:51.070 --> 26:52.596
STILL THINK
I'M REACHING?

26:52.696 --> 26:54.014
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

26:54.114 --> 26:56.032
AAH!

27:00.118 --> 27:03.288
OH!

27:10.710 --> 27:13.904
I GOT IT!

27:14.004 --> 27:15.089
OHH.

27:16.006 --> 27:17.091
LIVING ROOM'S CLEAR.

27:18.591 --> 27:19.784
SO'S THE KITCHEN.

27:19.884 --> 27:21.302
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE LEFT
SO SUDDENLY?

27:22.428 --> 27:24.079
WHAT, DID TRASHING
OUR HOUSE BECOME
TOO BORING FOR HER?

27:24.179 --> 27:27.040
SHE PROBABLY REALIZED
WE DON'T HAVE THE PRINCE.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.499
GREAT. IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE HAVING ENOUGH
PROBLEMS WITH PAIGE,

27:29.599 --> 27:32.811
WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HER PAST LIFE, TOO?

27:33.603 --> 27:34.896
OK. I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE PRINCE.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.506
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

27:39.606 --> 27:41.135
PAIGE'S PAST LIFE
ALMOST KILLED US.

27:41.235 --> 27:43.052
THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
WHAT?

27:43.152 --> 27:45.138
YEAH. PAIGE,
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS,

27:45.238 --> 27:47.597
SAME SOUL,
DIFFERENT LIFETIME.

27:47.697 --> 27:49.514
SHE CAME THROUGH
SOME MAGICAL PORTAL

27:49.614 --> 27:50.808
LOOKING FOR
PRINCE CARJACK.

27:50.908 --> 27:52.517
OK, WELL,
YOU HAVE TO STOP HER.
YOU CAN'T LET HER FIND HIM.

27:52.617 --> 27:54.728
ACCORDING TO THE ELDERS,

27:54.828 --> 27:56.480
IF SHE CONCEIVES HIS HEIR,

27:56.580 --> 27:57.616
DARK MAGIC WILL RULE
HIS KINGDOM FOREVER.

27:57.626 --> 27:59.522
HISTORY WILL BE REWRITTEN.

27:59.622 --> 28:01.066
YOUR FUTURE--
WILL BE SCREWED.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.735
THE WORLD WILL
PLUNGE INTO DARKNESS,
YADDA, YADDA, YADDA.

28:02.835 --> 28:05.653
OK, THAT'S
NOT HELPING.

28:05.753 --> 28:08.197
SO IF WE
VANQUISH
PAST PAIGE,

28:08.297 --> 28:09.990
DON'T WE RISK
VANQUISHING
OUR PAIGE, TOO?

28:10.090 --> 28:12.425
POSSIBLY.

28:13.468 --> 28:14.534
WELL, THEN FINE.
WE WON'T VANQUISH HER.

28:14.634 --> 28:17.263
WE'LL BIND HER POWERS
AND SEND HER BACK IN TIME,
HOPEFULLY A VIRGIN.

28:17.846 --> 28:21.891
OK. LET'S GET SOME CANDLES.
WE HAVE A POTION TO CONCOCT.

28:25.018 --> 28:28.546
WHAT LURES YOU
TO THIS TIME, MY PRINCE?

28:28.646 --> 28:31.857
WHO BECKONS THEE?

28:32.316 --> 28:33.733
Cowan: PAIGE?

28:37.362 --> 28:41.515
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOIN' HERE SO LATE?
THOUGHT YOU LEFT ALREADY.

28:41.615 --> 28:44.557
WHAT NAME
DID YOU CALL ME?

28:44.658 --> 28:46.869
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE IN THE FAIRE, TOO.

28:47.077 --> 28:49.204
DON'T FORGET
TO LOCK UP.

28:58.669 --> 29:02.114
SEE YOU IN THE MORNIN'.

29:02.214 --> 29:03.672
ON TIME WOULD
BE NICE FOR ONCE.

29:28.444 --> 29:31.930
LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU...

29:32.030 --> 29:34.681
PAIGE.

29:34.781 --> 29:36.325
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU EXIST,

29:38.493 --> 29:41.370
THAT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY REAL.

29:41.912 --> 29:45.816
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAVE YOU FROM
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS

29:45.916 --> 29:48.485
SO YOU COULD LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.361
BE WITH ME,
AND I SHALL.

29:50.461 --> 29:52.238
COME WITH ME.
LIVE IN MY CASTLE
AS MY PRINCESS.

29:52.338 --> 29:55.573
WHAT IS IT WITH
EVERYONE WANTING ME
TO MOVE IN WITH THEM?

29:55.673 --> 29:58.616
I CAN GIVE YOU
ALL THE RICHES
YOU DESIRE.

29:58.716 --> 30:01.036
I CAN TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM ALL THIS.

30:01.136 --> 30:02.912
TEMPTING AS THAT IS,
I KNOW THAT'S
JUST A SPELL TALKING.

30:03.012 --> 30:06.622
BUT ISN'T THAT
WHAT TRUE LOVE IS?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.250
FALLING UNDER
SOMEONE'S SPELL?

30:08.350 --> 30:11.461
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT,

30:11.561 --> 30:12.727
AND I'LL GIVE IT
TO YOU, I SWEAR.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.896
CAN YOU MAKE ME
AS GOOD AS PRUE WAS?

30:17.315 --> 30:19.484
NEVER MIND. YOU
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

30:20.943 --> 30:23.528
TRY ME.

30:26.738 --> 30:29.683
HEY!

30:29.783 --> 30:31.642
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH
THIS BARGING-IN THING?

30:31.742 --> 30:34.271
THIS IS
GETTING RIDICULOUS.

30:34.371 --> 30:35.980
SORRY.
THOUGHT HE WAS
ATTACKING YOU.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.065
HE WAS KISSING ME.
IT'S CALLED KISSING.

30:38.165 --> 30:40.568
AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

30:40.668 --> 30:41.985
I TOLD YOU I'D CALL
IF I NEEDED TO.

30:42.085 --> 30:43.651
WELL, SOMETHING'S
COME UP,

30:43.751 --> 30:44.653
SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE.

30:44.753 --> 30:46.653
SOMETHING WORSE THAN THIS?

30:46.753 --> 30:48.574
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS
IS HERE

30:48.674 --> 30:49.824
IN OUR WORLD.

30:49.924 --> 30:51.284
SHE NEARLY KILLED US
TRYIN' TO GET TO HIM.

30:51.384 --> 30:53.452
OH, MY GOD.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.203
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
NOT THE WORST PART.

30:55.303 --> 30:57.037
REMEMBER HOW
WE WERE WONDERING

30:57.138 --> 30:58.664
HOW SHE CAST
A SPELL ON HIM,
BUT HE FELL FOR YOU?

30:58.764 --> 31:01.665
YEAH.

31:01.765 --> 31:02.666
WELL, THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE HER.

31:02.766 --> 31:04.502
WELL, I MEAN--

31:04.602 --> 31:06.337
SH--SHE'S YOU.
UH, HER.

31:06.437 --> 31:09.047
YEAH. UH, HELP.

31:09.147 --> 31:10.174
LOOK, WHAT SHE MEANS

31:10.274 --> 31:11.383
IS THAT YOU WERE
THE EVIL ENCHANTRESS

31:11.483 --> 31:13.718
IN ONE OF
YOUR PAST LIVES,
SO WHEN YOU

31:13.818 --> 31:16.677
READ THE SPELL
IN THE BOOK
OF SHADOWS,

31:16.777 --> 31:18.679
HE CAME.

31:18.780 --> 31:20.140
AND THAT'S ALSO
WHY YOU REMEMBER

31:20.240 --> 31:22.517
THE FAIRY TALE
SO WELL--

31:22.617 --> 31:23.782
'CAUSE YOU'VE
ACTUALLY LIVED
IT ONCE BEFORE.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.745
OK! I CAN DEAL WITH THIS.

31:28.204 --> 31:30.523
YEAH.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.149
NO WONDER I RELATED
TO HER THE MOST.

31:32.249 --> 31:34.484
DOES THIS MEAN I'M EVIL?

31:34.584 --> 31:35.985
YEAH.

31:36.085 --> 31:36.986
NO!
NO.

31:37.086 --> 31:38.112
NO, NOT YOU.

31:38.212 --> 31:39.363
JUST YOUR...
PAST SELF.

31:39.463 --> 31:41.072
YOU'VE GROWN
AND EVOLVED.

31:41.172 --> 31:42.697
BELIEVE ME, WE--
WE ALL HAVE.

31:42.797 --> 31:44.367
THAT'S
WHAT WE DO.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.367
RIGHT.

31:45.468 --> 31:46.368
SO. THE PLAN

31:46.468 --> 31:47.578
IS TO BIND
THE ENCHANTRESS'
POWERS

31:47.678 --> 31:49.829
WITH THIS
LITTLE POTION.

31:49.929 --> 31:51.581
I'LL DO IT.

31:51.681 --> 31:53.166
ALL RIGHT.
THEN WE'LL--

31:53.266 --> 31:55.167
Paige: NO.

31:55.267 --> 31:56.560
I MEAN BY MYSELF.

31:57.477 --> 31:58.587
I PUT YOU GUYS
IN DANGER.

31:58.687 --> 32:00.463
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF IT.

32:00.563 --> 32:01.712
IT'S MY STORY.

32:01.812 --> 32:03.299
I HAVE TO END IT
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.550
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO FIND
THE ENCHANTRESS.

32:05.650 --> 32:07.510
WELL, SHE'S AFTER
THE PRINCE, RIGHT?

32:07.610 --> 32:08.761
I'LL JUST...BACKTRACK
AND SURPRISE HER.

32:08.861 --> 32:10.803
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO
DO THIS ALONE.

32:10.904 --> 32:12.822
IT'S NOT JUST
YOUR STORY ANYMORE.
YOU'VE GOT SISTERS NOW.

32:13.281 --> 32:15.823
BUT, UH, IF YOU
WANT TO DO IT
BY YOURSELF,

32:17.075 --> 32:19.061
THEN GO FOR IT.

32:19.161 --> 32:20.479
I DO.

32:20.579 --> 32:21.728
YEAH. IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT,
WE'LL BE HERE,

32:21.828 --> 32:23.665
UH, WITH THE PRINCE.

32:25.831 --> 32:29.152
WHY'D YOU
LET HER GO?

32:29.252 --> 32:30.736
BECAUSE IT'S TIME
WE REALIZE

32:30.836 --> 32:32.756
WE CAN'T MAKE HER
DO SOMETHING SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO DO.

33:09.866 --> 33:13.562
DON'T TELL ME
I BECOME GOOD
IN THE FUTURE.

33:13.662 --> 33:15.872
DAMN GOOD.

33:22.876 --> 33:26.879
AND HERE I WAS
SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING MYSELF.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.258
AAAHHH!

33:35.887 --> 33:39.124
WHAT IS IT?

33:39.224 --> 33:40.292
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
PAIGE IS IN TROUBLE.

33:40.392 --> 33:42.559
WELL, GO, GO, GO!

33:45.771 --> 33:48.896
REMEMBER ME?

33:59.407 --> 34:02.559
[GASPS]

34:02.659 --> 34:03.560
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:03.660 --> 34:04.909
UH...THE EVIL
ENCHANTRESS.

34:08.163 --> 34:09.415
OH, NO.

34:14.502 --> 34:18.129
COME TO ME,
MY PRINCE.
UHH...UHH...

34:25.176 --> 34:28.245
UHH!

34:28.344 --> 34:30.013
UHH!

34:31.348 --> 34:32.666
Phoebe: WE CAN'T
JUST LET HER GET AWAY!

34:32.766 --> 34:34.167
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO,

34:34.266 --> 34:35.501
GO BACK
TO THE MIDDLE AGES,
THE DARK AGES,

34:35.601 --> 34:37.168
WHATEVER HELL AGES
THOSE ARE?!

34:37.268 --> 34:38.936
IF WE DON'T, GOOD MAGIC
WILL BE GONE FOREVER.

34:41.938 --> 34:44.940
NO!

34:45.650 --> 34:45.984
OHHH.

34:48.862 --> 34:49.944
WHAT HAVE
I DONE?

34:53.947 --> 34:57.185
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

34:57.285 --> 34:58.851
PIPER AND PHOEBE
WERE CRAZY TO TRUST ME.

34:58.951 --> 35:01.188
WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN TO THEM?

35:01.288 --> 35:02.773
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO LOSE IT, PAIGE.

35:02.874 --> 35:04.857
WE NEED
TO GET THEM BACK.

35:04.957 --> 35:06.233
GET THEM BACK?

35:06.333 --> 35:07.610
WHAT DO WE DO,
HOP ON A BUS
TO MEDIEVAL TIMES?

35:07.710 --> 35:09.860
PAIGE, CONCENTRATE.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.488
YOU'RE A POWERFUL WITCH,
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.

35:11.588 --> 35:13.863
WELL, I WASN'T POWERFUL
ENOUGH TO TAKE OUT
THE ENCHANTRESS, WAS I?

35:13.963 --> 35:16.866
YOU KNOW, ONE THING
YOUR PAST LIFE
SHOULD TELL YOU

35:16.966 --> 35:18.327
IS THAT YOU'VE
ALWAYS BEEN POWERFUL.

35:18.427 --> 35:20.286
YOU STILL
HAVE THAT POWER
INSIDE OF YOU.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.763
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TAP INTO IT NOW.

35:26.516 --> 35:30.002
OK, THIS IS
MY FAIRY TALE, RIGHT?

35:30.102 --> 35:32.254
YES.

35:32.354 --> 35:33.974
THIS ALL STARTED
WITH A SPELL THAT
BROUGHT THE PRINCE HERE,

35:33.984 --> 35:35.423
SO MAYBE IF I
REARRANGE IT A LITTLE?

35:35.523 --> 35:39.485
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF
BRINGING THE PRINCE TO ME,
I BRING MYSELF TO HIM?

35:39.984 --> 35:43.304
CREATING YOUR OWN PORTAL?

35:43.404 --> 35:45.988
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

35:47.990 --> 35:50.892
BRING TOGETHER
MY PRINCE AND ME,

35:50.992 --> 35:52.646
HIS KINGDOM NOW
I WISH TO SEE,

35:52.746 --> 35:55.022
CROSSING HISTORY
TO HIS SIDE,

35:55.122 --> 35:56.998
FROM MYSELF
I WILL NOT HIDE.

35:58.082 --> 35:59.417
OH, MY GOD, I DID IT.
IT WORKED.

36:04.671 --> 36:08.424
COME ON. I'M NOT
DOING THIS BY MYSELF.

36:12.427 --> 36:16.430
SO ARE YOU STILL GLAD
YOU TOLD PAIGE
TO "GO FOR IT"?

36:18.014 --> 36:21.251
HEY, YOU WERE THE ONE

36:21.351 --> 36:22.752
THAT WANTED US
TO BE MORE SISTERLY
TOWARDS HER.

36:22.852 --> 36:24.919
YES, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE
OF BEING TRAPPED
IN THE DARK AGES

36:25.019 --> 36:27.840
WHERE OUR POWERS
ARE USELESS.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.591
YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE.

36:29.691 --> 36:32.885
WHAT LAND
DID YOU COME FROM?

36:32.985 --> 36:35.679
DISNEYLAND.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.928
FUTUREWORLD.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.929
PHOEBE! WE'RE WITCHES,

36:38.029 --> 36:40.182
AND WE HAVE THE POTION
THAT WILL STOP
THE ENCHANTRESS.

36:40.282 --> 36:43.226
YEAH.
LET'S GO GET HER.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.787
OOPS! WE CAN'T,
BECAUSE WE'RE
CHAINED TO A WALL!

36:53.919 --> 36:57.195
OK, FIND PHOEBE AND PIPER.

36:57.295 --> 36:58.823
I'LL TRY TO HOLD HER OFF
UNTIL THEY GET HERE.

36:58.923 --> 37:00.365
HOW? YOUR POWERS
DON'T WORK IN THE PAST.

37:00.465 --> 37:03.075
YEAH, BUT IF WE REALLY
ARE ONE AND THE SAME,

37:03.175 --> 37:05.578
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TAP INTO HERS.

37:05.678 --> 37:08.555
HURRY.
GO GET MY SISTERS.

37:13.267 --> 37:16.937
PIPER, PHOEBE.
Piper: LEO!

37:18.061 --> 37:18.771
OH! EASY, EASY.

37:21.314 --> 37:22.357
BEHIND YOU!
AAH!

37:39.077 --> 37:43.080
HI. I HATE TO INTERRUPT
MYSELF AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

37:44.207 --> 37:47.652
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

37:47.752 --> 37:49.779
I'M CHARMED.

37:49.879 --> 37:51.547
NOT FOR LONG.

38:00.512 --> 38:03.932
OH, MY! OH! OH!

38:10.729 --> 38:13.840
OH...

38:13.940 --> 38:15.883
WOW.

38:15.983 --> 38:17.107
LEO.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.678
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A PACIFIST.

38:20.778 --> 38:21.763
I DIDN'T KILL HIM,
DID I?

38:21.863 --> 38:23.697
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I FIND THIS VERY SEXY.

38:24.113 --> 38:27.225
REALLY?

38:27.325 --> 38:28.351
YEAH.

38:28.451 --> 38:29.435
YOU'VE BEEN
HOLDIN' OUT ON US.

38:29.535 --> 38:31.118
HI.

38:32.162 --> 38:33.146
HI.

38:33.246 --> 38:34.146
WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

38:34.247 --> 38:35.231
PAIGE. POTION! POTION!

38:35.331 --> 38:37.583
POTION!

38:39.124 --> 38:42.462
DON'T HURT HER.

38:44.128 --> 38:47.549
THROW THE POTION.

38:52.511 --> 38:55.680
NOW.

39:00.643 --> 39:04.044
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO ME?

39:04.144 --> 39:05.421
WE'VE BOUND YOUR POWERS,
ENCHANTRESS.

39:05.521 --> 39:07.298
NO MORE KINGDOM COME
FOR YOU.

39:07.398 --> 39:09.091
NOT FOR YOU.

39:09.191 --> 39:10.092
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

39:10.192 --> 39:11.885
TO US?

39:11.985 --> 39:13.051
I DIDN'T DO IT.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.988
WE DID IT.

39:33.710 --> 39:37.170
I AM WELL, MY LOVE.

39:37.923 --> 39:38.673
"MY LOVE."

39:41.173 --> 39:42.379
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT TAKES THE KISS
OF TRUE LOVE

39:42.389 --> 39:44.411
TO BREAK THE SPELL.

39:44.511 --> 39:46.077
IT'S IN
EVERY FAIRY TALE.

39:46.177 --> 39:48.472
ALL RIGHT,
SUPERWITCH,
GET US OUTTA HERE.

39:49.682 --> 39:52.392
[CLAPS]

39:57.813 --> 40:01.716
OK, SO I WON'T BE
GETTING MY SECURITY
DEPOSIT BACK.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.777
YEAH. TOO BAD YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
PLACE TO STAY.

40:06.153 --> 40:09.263
IT'S NO PRESSURE.

40:09.363 --> 40:11.097
IT'S TOTALLY UP TO YOU
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

40:11.197 --> 40:13.098
YEAH. WHO NEEDS
ELECTRICITY ANYWAY?

40:13.198 --> 40:15.910
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO STAY
IN THE BASEMENT, WOULD I?

40:17.201 --> 40:19.438
[SNICKERS] NO.

40:19.538 --> 40:21.315
OF COURSE NOT.

40:21.415 --> 40:23.166
I THINK
WE HAVE A ROOM FOR YOU.

40:32.213 --> 40:35.451
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

40:35.551 --> 40:37.094
[KNOCKING]

40:37.720 --> 40:40.830
TA-DA!

40:40.930 --> 40:42.014
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:43.222 --> 40:45.123
WOW.
IT'S DEFINITELY...

40:45.223 --> 40:47.961
DIFFERENT.

40:48.061 --> 40:49.126
IT'S DEFINITELY YOU.

40:49.227 --> 40:50.337
IS THAT
A GOOD THING?

40:50.438 --> 40:52.006
OF COURSE
IT'S A GOOD THING.

40:52.106 --> 40:53.673
GOOD, 'CAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY
THINKING THE LIVING ROOM

40:53.773 --> 40:57.133
COULD USE
A LITTLE SPICING UP.

40:57.233 --> 40:59.053
DON'T PUSH IT.

40:59.153 --> 41:00.553
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

41:00.654 --> 41:02.097
OH, I HOPE
THAT'S NOT ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR PAST LIVES.

41:02.197 --> 41:05.139
NO. IT'S JUST GLEN.
I ASKED HIM TO DROP BY.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.559
OH, THE CUTE GUY
FROM THE APARTMENT?

41:07.659 --> 41:08.852
HE'S YUMMY.

41:08.952 --> 41:10.020
YEAH, HE IS,

41:10.120 --> 41:11.239
BUT HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO BE YUMMY IN AUSTRALIA.

41:11.249 --> 41:13.145
HE'S LEAVING.

41:13.245 --> 41:14.330
HE ASKED ME TO GO WITH,
BUT I DECIDED TO PASS.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.360
OH. ARE YOU
DISAPPOINTED?

41:19.460 --> 41:21.528
A LITTLE,

41:21.628 --> 41:23.254
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
I'LL BE LACKING
IN ADVENTURES HERE.

41:24.254 --> 41:26.256
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

41:28.801 --> 41:31.828
SHALL WE?

41:31.928 --> 41:33.221
HIT IT.

41:38.017 --> 41:41.461
VANQUISH,
WE THREE WITCHES CRY.

41:41.561 --> 41:44.270
ONE FINAL SHOCK
AND THEN YOU DIE.

41:47.858 --> 41:50.927
OK.

41:51.027 --> 41:52.302
PIECE O' CAKE.
GOTTA GO.

41:52.402 --> 41:54.304
AND DON'T FORGET,
IF YOU NEED ME,

41:54.404 --> 41:56.239
PLEASE KNOCK.

41:56.405 --> 41:57.281
AND THEY LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

42:01.283 --> 42:04.312
YEAH, RIGHT.

42:04.412 --> 42:06.039
RIGHT.
