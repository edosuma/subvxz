(singing Russian hip-hop)

00:18.751 --> 00:20.818

_

01:00.357 --> 01:01.891
- ELIZABETH: Passport?
- Check.

01:01.892 --> 01:03.692
Wait.

01:04.527 --> 01:06.629
Oh. Okay, check.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.431
- Lecture notes.
- What?

01:08.432 --> 01:09.599
Lecture notes?

01:09.600 --> 01:12.235
Oh, uh, yeah. Got it. Okay. Check.

01:12.236 --> 01:13.269
What about that big, ugly parka

01:13.270 --> 01:14.658
that I bought you that's so warm?

01:14.659 --> 01:16.573
- Uh... Yes.
- You gonna take it?

01:16.574 --> 01:18.141
Got it. Russia...

01:18.142 --> 01:19.642
here I come. I'm all set.

01:19.643 --> 01:21.444
Listen, I want you to
take this cell phone

01:21.445 --> 01:22.879
instead of your regular one.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.381
What? Why? Better calling plan or...?

01:24.382 --> 01:26.349
It's a more secure line.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.118
You know, there's nothing
covert about this visit.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.753
I'm just lecturing about fundamentalism

01:29.754 --> 01:31.654
to a bunch of colonels named Boris.

01:31.655 --> 01:33.456
First of all, it's not just a lecture.

01:33.457 --> 01:35.658
These military-to-military exchanges

01:35.659 --> 01:37.594
help keep the peace. It's a big deal.

01:37.595 --> 01:39.696
I feel special again. Thanks.

01:39.697 --> 01:41.297
You think just anyone

01:41.298 --> 01:42.966
gets invited to these things,

01:42.967 --> 01:44.901
especially at the personal behest

01:44.902 --> 01:46.653
- of Foreign Minister Gorev?
- Guess he forgot

01:46.654 --> 01:48.411
that I once refused to
give his daughter an "A."

01:48.412 --> 01:49.339
- Ha.
- Do the world a favor:

01:49.340 --> 01:50.607
don't remind him of that.

01:50.608 --> 01:53.043
Now, that is a secure line

01:53.044 --> 01:55.011
so that we can, you know,

01:55.012 --> 01:57.814
talk without any Borises listening in.

01:57.815 --> 01:59.516
Just in case you have
trouble staying warm

01:59.517 --> 02:01.817
on those long winter nights.

02:03.787 --> 02:05.455
ARTHUR (laughing): I was not sleeping.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.223
- (laughing): Yes, you were.
- I was meditating.

02:07.224 --> 02:08.991
You were not; you were
snoring in the middle of...

02:08.993 --> 02:10.060
- I was not.
- Yes.

02:10.061 --> 02:11.661
- Was I?
- Yes.

02:11.662 --> 02:13.263
But you find that incredibly
sexy though, right?

02:13.264 --> 02:14.564
Snoring.

02:14.565 --> 02:15.799
Come on, it's not an old thing.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.200
It was a, it was a boring movie.

02:17.201 --> 02:18.601
- No.
- Come on, I'm so with it.

02:18.602 --> 02:19.803
I'm so... Look, come on.

02:19.804 --> 02:20.937
Look at my phone.

02:20.938 --> 02:22.839
Look at all the applications

02:22.840 --> 02:23.873
and life hacks... I have on here.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.742
- (laughing): Life hacks.
- (phone dings)

02:25.743 --> 02:26.976
Whoa.

02:26.977 --> 02:28.678
What?

02:28.679 --> 02:30.947
Let me see.

02:30.948 --> 02:33.083
Oh, my God, where'd you get that?

02:33.084 --> 02:34.851
I have an alert app that dings me

02:34.852 --> 02:37.020
every time your name or photo
shows up on the Internet.

02:37.021 --> 02:38.288
See? With it.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.723
- What? - Well, no, I have it
for everyone in the office.

02:40.724 --> 02:43.560
- I have to make sure they're not
making the wrong kind of news. - Oh.

02:43.561 --> 02:45.728
Wait, how did this get here?

02:45.729 --> 02:46.796
Well, who posted it?

02:46.797 --> 02:47.964
Alison!

02:47.965 --> 02:50.133
Alison, it's her account.

02:50.134 --> 02:52.001
God, I'm gonna kill her.

02:52.002 --> 02:54.671
And that-that's... that's,
that's Harrison, right?

02:54.672 --> 02:56.539
- Yeah.
- (whispering): The, uh, president's son?

02:56.540 --> 02:58.441
Yeah.

02:58.442 --> 03:00.143
Sort of breaks your heart to see him

03:00.144 --> 03:02.511
before all the bad choices.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.638
- ALISON: I don't see what the big deal is.
- He's the president's son, Ali!

03:06.639 --> 03:08.184
That kind of makes it a big deal.

03:08.185 --> 03:09.786
Plus, he really needs privacy right now.

03:09.787 --> 03:11.621
- What does that mean?
- Don't worry about what it means.

03:11.622 --> 03:12.889
Just take the picture down.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.424
Wait, are you freaking out
because there actually

03:14.425 --> 03:15.992
is something going on
between you and Harrison?

03:15.993 --> 03:18.495
No, no, look, I already told you
we dated for, like, three weeks

03:18.496 --> 03:19.729
when I was your age, okay?

03:19.730 --> 03:20.763
We are just friends.

03:20.764 --> 03:22.665
But it is really important to me

03:22.666 --> 03:25.401
that he feels like I am
someone that he can trust.

03:25.402 --> 03:26.703
Please be more mysterious.

03:26.704 --> 03:28.071
Look, I don't want him looking at this

03:28.072 --> 03:30.039
and thinking that I'm going
around telling people

03:30.040 --> 03:33.009
that I'm "one half of Starrison."

03:33.010 --> 03:35.712
And according to this,
not the cute half.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.247
HENRY: Girls, I'm leaving.

03:37.248 --> 03:39.582
Come say <i>do svidan'ya.</i>

03:39.583 --> 03:41.417
(sighs)

03:41.418 --> 03:43.552
Let's go say <i>do svidan'ya.</i>

03:45.054 --> 03:46.422
(elevator bell dings)

03:46.423 --> 03:47.724
- ELIZABETH: Morning, all.
- ALL: Morning.

03:47.725 --> 03:50.293
Nadine tells me I have a
very full schedule today.

03:50.294 --> 03:52.929
Uh, yes, we're starting
with the Russian war games

03:52.930 --> 03:54.097
off the Alaskan coast.

03:54.098 --> 03:55.298
They began this morning.

03:55.299 --> 03:57.734
A flotilla of some 50 different
vessels and aircraft.

03:57.735 --> 03:59.469
They're technically within their rights.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.204
The maneuvers and test
firings are taking place

04:01.205 --> 04:03.940
on international waters and
outside American airspace.

04:03.941 --> 04:05.942
Still insultingly close
to our northern borders.

04:05.943 --> 04:07.568
But we were expecting
something like this, right?

04:07.569 --> 04:08.978
After the NATO thing?

04:08.979 --> 04:10.747
NADINE: Yes, it's believed to be a response

04:10.748 --> 04:13.116
to our announced deployment
of the NATO Rapid Response

04:13.117 --> 04:14.551
Strike Force in Latvia.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.553
DAISY: Which was our response
to Russia's meddling

04:16.553 --> 04:17.853
in its neighbor's affairs.

04:17.855 --> 04:19.755
Moldova being the most recent example.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.391
White House expects us to send

04:21.392 --> 04:24.060
a démarche, ma'am, a
diplomatic cable in protest.

04:24.061 --> 04:25.895
The NATO force in Latvia
was the right call.

04:25.896 --> 04:29.098
I'm just annoyed that
Ostrov is so determined

04:29.099 --> 04:30.200
to refight the Cold War,

04:30.201 --> 04:32.402
instead of fixing his crappy economy.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.804
Don't, uh, put that in
the protest thingy.

04:34.805 --> 04:35.972
Yes.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.440
MATT: Speaking of the Cold War, Ma'am?

04:37.441 --> 04:38.942
There's a ceremony today

04:38.943 --> 04:40.743
for Ezra Lyle Helsinger,

04:40.744 --> 04:42.712
the department's oldest
foreign service office.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.148
He's retiring today, after
60 years of service.

04:45.149 --> 04:47.250
Wow, 60 years.

04:47.251 --> 04:48.384
Good for him.

04:48.385 --> 04:49.786
I'm sorry, ma'am?

04:49.787 --> 04:51.853
You're needed in the Situation Room.

04:52.488 --> 04:54.724
JACKSON: Elizabeth.

04:54.725 --> 04:55.825
What's up?

04:55.826 --> 04:57.260
Blake couldn't give me any details.

04:57.261 --> 04:58.561
That's because it's need to know.

04:58.562 --> 05:00.797
Okay, what do I need to know?

05:00.798 --> 05:02.098
Russian war games have gotten heated.

05:02.099 --> 05:03.433
One of their subs split

05:03.434 --> 05:06.169
from the fleet and has crossed
into US coastal waters.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.670
That's aggressive, but
not unprecedented.

05:07.671 --> 05:08.938
Sure, Russians like

05:08.939 --> 05:11.007
to test our defenses,
just like we test theirs,

05:11.008 --> 05:13.142
but we were tracking
the sub, and it vanished.

05:13.143 --> 05:14.976
That is unprecedented.

05:15.945 --> 05:18.815
So they've perfected some
kind of cloaking technology.

05:18.816 --> 05:20.984
And the sub's nuclear
armed, I'm guessing?

05:20.985 --> 05:22.652
And now it's somewhere
off the Alaska shoreline,

05:22.653 --> 05:24.254
intentions unknown.

05:24.255 --> 05:26.489
Could be posturing, could be
about starting World War III.

05:26.490 --> 05:27.624
What's Ostrov saying?

05:27.625 --> 05:28.958
We've tried calling
President Ostrov directly.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.426
We're told he's at a remote location.

05:30.427 --> 05:31.494
He can't be reached.

05:31.495 --> 05:32.662
So he's vanished, as well.

05:32.663 --> 05:33.896
(sighs)

05:33.897 --> 05:35.965
Heck of a week for
Henry to go to Russia.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.966
Can't disagree with you there.

05:49.145 --> 05:52.248
Thank you.

05:52.249 --> 05:53.583
Professor McCord, you are most welcome.

05:53.584 --> 05:54.717
Thank you, Minister Gorev.

05:54.718 --> 05:56.886
You must call me Anton.

05:56.887 --> 05:59.222
Even after I wouldn't give your
daughter an "A" last semester?

05:59.223 --> 06:00.323
I overreached in asking.

06:00.324 --> 06:03.226
An "Incomplete" was generous.

06:03.227 --> 06:04.360
Well, good.

06:04.361 --> 06:06.262
I'm glad we cleared the air on that.

06:06.263 --> 06:07.563
As am I.

06:07.564 --> 06:11.100
Indeed, that is the purpose
of these wonderful meetings

06:11.101 --> 06:12.669
between our militaries.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.204
To keep the air clear.

06:15.205 --> 06:19.175
Especially in a time of such...

06:19.176 --> 06:22.679
unfortunate misunderstandings.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.813
Thank you very much.

06:23.814 --> 06:25.081
It's an honor to be here.

06:25.082 --> 06:26.416
I'm gonna speak with you today

06:26.417 --> 06:28.951
about a subject that is
of great importance

06:28.952 --> 06:31.087
to our two countries and
our common civilization,

06:31.088 --> 06:34.257
and that is the roots of the two notions

06:34.258 --> 06:36.993
of righteous religious
warfare or struggle.

06:36.994 --> 06:38.961
Namely, jihad in classical Islam,

06:38.962 --> 06:41.698
and in both Eastern and
Western Christianity,

06:41.699 --> 06:44.099
the concept of crusade.

06:50.073 --> 06:52.275
GOREV: Professor McCord, may
I introduce the president

06:52.276 --> 06:54.544
of the Russian Federation

06:54.545 --> 06:56.346
and our supreme commander-in-chief,

06:56.347 --> 06:58.014
Pavel Ostrov.

06:58.015 --> 06:59.415
Professor McCord,

06:59.416 --> 07:01.584
it is an honor to meet you.

07:01.585 --> 07:02.985
(stammers)

07:02.986 --> 07:05.722
It's also my honor, uh, Mr. President,

07:05.723 --> 07:07.757
and a bit of a surprise.

07:07.758 --> 07:10.326
I like to come to this place
on occasion for a visit.

07:10.327 --> 07:11.561
For the beautiful country,

07:11.562 --> 07:13.996
the recreation and for the game.

07:13.997 --> 07:16.833
I'm told you enjoy blood sports.

07:16.834 --> 07:20.036
If, by that, you mean hunting,

07:20.037 --> 07:23.473
then, yes, my father took me sometimes.

07:23.474 --> 07:25.541
Deer, duck, an occasional squirrel.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.243
Then you must come hunt with me.

07:27.244 --> 07:28.511
No refusing.

07:28.512 --> 07:30.012
My pleasure is to show

07:30.013 --> 07:31.914
the goodness of Russian life

07:31.915 --> 07:33.549
to such eminent, distinguished guest.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.817
With such a beautiful,

07:34.818 --> 07:37.285
eminent wife.

07:45.395 --> 07:48.297
ADMIRAL HILL: <i>Mr. President,
we've been in contact.</i>

07:48.298 --> 07:50.166
They deny that sub is even there.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.969
Still claiming their
right to refute reality.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.138
What do we know about the sub itself?

07:55.139 --> 07:56.839
We think it's the <i>Yalta,
</i> sir; it's a new sub

07:56.840 --> 07:59.842
out of Vladivostok with an
experimental stealth technology

07:59.843 --> 08:01.444
more advanced than ours.

08:01.445 --> 08:02.445
Apparently.

08:02.446 --> 08:04.514
It's powered by a fission reactor,

08:04.515 --> 08:06.382
carrying six Bulava-type
cruise missiles,

08:06.383 --> 08:08.117
each with 150-kiloton warhead

08:08.118 --> 08:10.253
and a range of about 60 miles.

08:10.254 --> 08:12.822
But again, what is most
disturbing about it...

08:12.823 --> 08:14.357
Besides the fact that it could be

08:14.358 --> 08:16.025
on its way to flatten Anchorage...

08:16.026 --> 08:18.327
(sonar pinging) ...is how
they have just proven

08:18.328 --> 08:21.898
that they can evade all
forms of detection by sonar,

08:21.899 --> 08:23.433
magnetic anomaly

08:23.434 --> 08:25.635
or satellite array.

08:25.636 --> 08:27.603
A true stealth weapon.

08:27.604 --> 08:29.806
They can hit us before we
even know they're there.

08:29.807 --> 08:32.707
Ostrov's been bankrupting his economy,

08:32.708 --> 08:35.778
trying to get back to
military parity with the West.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.816
- Now he may have it.
- DALTON: Well, they've got the drop on us.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.347
The question is what do they want?

08:39.349 --> 08:41.116
Is Ostrov just making us sweat,

08:41.118 --> 08:44.085
or is this more than posturing?

08:44.687 --> 08:45.888
Sir...

08:45.889 --> 08:48.291
if Ostrov isn't talking to us,

08:48.292 --> 08:51.526
I may know somebody who will.

08:52.128 --> 08:54.030
Nadine...

08:54.031 --> 08:56.299
you clear my schedule
for the rest of the day?

08:56.300 --> 08:57.600
All of it, ma'am?

08:57.601 --> 08:59.335
And, Nadine, quietly, okay?

08:59.336 --> 09:01.637
Get Gorev on SVTC, please.

09:01.638 --> 09:02.939
Yes, ma'am.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.540
Is everything okay, ma'am?

09:04.541 --> 09:05.842
Yeah, it's fine.

09:05.843 --> 09:08.044
I just need to clear my schedule.

09:08.045 --> 09:09.745
Oh, it's definitely a loose nuke.

09:09.746 --> 09:10.947
We're all dead.

09:10.948 --> 09:12.582
Good news is there's a
bunker in the basement.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.150
Okay, that's enough doomsday.

09:14.151 --> 09:15.218
You heard the secretary.

09:15.219 --> 09:16.619
Let's clear her schedule.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.854
Quietly.

09:17.855 --> 09:19.522
Okay.

09:19.523 --> 09:20.556
She's fun.

09:20.557 --> 09:23.960
NADINE: I heard that.

09:23.961 --> 09:25.461
Don't try and evade the issue,

09:25.462 --> 09:28.664
and don't try telling me the
this sub isn't there, Anton.

09:28.665 --> 09:29.932
It's just the two of us now.

09:29.933 --> 09:32.068
Yes, two friends talking
openly and honestly,

09:32.069 --> 09:34.937
but then friends also don't
put powerful weapons

09:34.938 --> 09:36.372
on each other's borders.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.241
(chuckles) I'm listening.

09:38.242 --> 09:41.978
I thought it might come to this.

09:41.979 --> 09:44.747
So, say one of our subs
did lose its direction

09:44.748 --> 09:46.449
and come too close to your Alaska

09:46.450 --> 09:48.484
with its bears and salmon.

09:48.485 --> 09:51.387
You're about to put NATO
troops on the Latvian border,

09:51.388 --> 09:53.122
just a few hundred miles from Moscow.

09:53.123 --> 09:56.025
Which is less friendly?

09:56.026 --> 09:58.928
So what can we do about that?

09:58.929 --> 10:00.897
Cancel the NATO deployment,

10:00.898 --> 10:02.098
and perhaps the captain

10:02.099 --> 10:03.833
will find his map again,

10:03.834 --> 10:05.434
come back home.

10:05.435 --> 10:07.036
Honest enough for you?

10:07.037 --> 10:08.337
Perfectly.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.506
You also know I'm being honest

10:10.507 --> 10:12.608
when I tell you that
bullying and threats

10:12.609 --> 10:15.211
will not alter the resolve
of the United States

10:15.212 --> 10:16.412
or its allies.

10:16.413 --> 10:20.182
And your president needs
to pick up the phone.

10:20.183 --> 10:22.718
I will tell him myself when I see him.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.686
He can't have gone far.

10:25.655 --> 10:26.923
What are you talking about?

10:26.924 --> 10:28.257
Didn't you know?

10:28.258 --> 10:30.826
President Ostrov has
invited your husband Henry

10:30.827 --> 10:32.161
to go hunting with him.

10:32.162 --> 10:34.230
They're in the woods, hunting grouse.

10:34.231 --> 10:36.399
One of President Ostrov's
favorite pastimes.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.269
It's quite an honor for your husband.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.471
Is that what it is?

10:42.472 --> 10:45.908
I'm certain they're
having a wonderful time.

10:45.909 --> 10:48.945
All I can say is,

10:48.946 --> 10:50.479
they better be.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.948
Until later, Madam Secretary.

11:05.561 --> 11:06.562
(phone ringing)

11:06.563 --> 11:09.798
Oh. Sorry.

11:11.634 --> 11:13.636
Hunt requires quiet, Professor.

11:13.637 --> 11:17.707
We are not having very much luck today.

11:17.708 --> 11:20.743
Maybe the camera crew had
something to do with it.

11:20.744 --> 11:22.745
I don't understand.

11:22.746 --> 11:25.281
With this gun, I always
have very good luck.

11:25.282 --> 11:26.849
Oh, it's beautiful.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.784
My grandfather's.

11:28.785 --> 11:31.320
He kept it with him in
the Great Patriotic War,

11:31.321 --> 11:34.590
your World War II, during
the Blockade Leningrad.

11:34.591 --> 11:36.325
The Siege of Leningrad?

11:36.326 --> 11:38.561
- You know it?
- Yes, of course.

11:38.562 --> 11:42.531
Through entire blockade,
my grandfather kept it

11:42.532 --> 11:45.334
cocked and loaded by the front door,

11:45.335 --> 11:47.670
so, if the Germans ever break through,

11:47.671 --> 11:51.207
if they come to the house for
my aunts and my grandmother,

11:51.208 --> 11:53.676
he has something to
shoot the enemy with.

11:53.677 --> 11:56.212
And if necessary...

11:56.213 --> 11:59.214
his family, and then himself.

12:00.316 --> 12:01.517
May I ask, sir,

12:01.518 --> 12:03.452
why you're telling me all this?

12:03.453 --> 12:05.354
Our people are never

12:05.355 --> 12:08.424
frightened, Professor, and
we outlast our enemy.

12:08.425 --> 12:10.860
So, tell your wife and your president,

12:10.861 --> 12:13.529
we don't back down.

12:13.530 --> 12:16.198
I will convey your message, Mr. President.

12:16.199 --> 12:19.268
But to be honest, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

12:19.269 --> 12:21.604
Don't worry. They will.

12:21.605 --> 12:23.606
(bird squawks)

12:23.607 --> 12:25.207
(wings fluttering)

12:25.208 --> 12:27.675
(gunshot)

12:29.679 --> 12:31.013
ELIZABETH: He did what?

12:31.014 --> 12:32.782
HENRY: Yeah. My left
ear is still ringing.

12:32.783 --> 12:35.084
But at least now I know
what that was all about.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.285
He was using me for propaganda.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.486
Let's just hope

12:37.487 --> 12:39.488
- that's all you are.
- HENRY: You really think

12:39.489 --> 12:41.424
- he'd take me hostage?
- ELIZABETH: I don't know.

12:41.425 --> 12:44.393
Clearly, he coordinated the
sub incursion with your visit.

12:44.394 --> 12:45.961
It's just optics.

12:45.962 --> 12:47.797
Lecturing the Secretary
of State's husband

12:47.798 --> 12:50.166
while his sub is sneaking around Alaska?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.567
The message is:

12:51.568 --> 12:54.370
don't let NATO troops go into Latvia.

12:54.371 --> 12:57.006
Well, now that we've heard
it, why don't you come home?

12:57.007 --> 12:58.808
No, if I cut and run now,

12:58.809 --> 13:00.876
he'll just know that we're scared.

13:00.877 --> 13:03.112
I think I should act
like everything is fine.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.448
They've invited me to tour
an Orthodox monastery

13:05.449 --> 13:06.682
of St. George.

13:06.683 --> 13:07.917
I think I should go.

13:07.918 --> 13:10.352
Besides, it's a significant
historical site,

13:10.353 --> 13:12.988
crucial to the spread of
Christianity during Mongol Rule.

13:12.989 --> 13:15.524
I am finding your dorkiness

13:15.525 --> 13:17.560
oddly reassuring right now.

13:17.561 --> 13:19.528
We need you in there.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.931
Henry, I gotta go.

13:21.932 --> 13:24.100
Be safe, okay?

13:24.101 --> 13:26.501
I will. Okay.

13:28.504 --> 13:30.673
Henry all right?

13:30.674 --> 13:33.442
As long as the only actual
shots being fired are

13:33.443 --> 13:36.045
at a bunch of defenseless birds, yeah,

13:36.046 --> 13:37.179
I think we're all right.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.714
Mr. President, this is
Ostrov grandstanding.

13:38.715 --> 13:40.983
Clearly, the man likes to put on a show.

13:40.984 --> 13:42.184
DALTON: What are you proposing, Darren?

13:42.185 --> 13:43.552
DARREN: Well, if he wants to grandstand,

13:43.553 --> 13:45.154
hide-and-seek with the sub,

13:45.155 --> 13:47.223
not to mention whatever
he's trying to do with

13:47.224 --> 13:49.391
the secretary's husband, we
should put on a show right back.

13:49.392 --> 13:51.827
Not only mobilize the
strike force to Latvia,

13:51.828 --> 13:54.864
but deploy the Sixth Fleet's
flagship to the Black Sea.

13:54.865 --> 13:58.267
Turkey will allow it, but it's posturing.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.935
It's us doing exactly

13:59.936 --> 14:03.506
what Ostrov is doing,
only bigger and louder.

14:03.507 --> 14:07.109
Surest sign of strength is to
show you are able to use it.

14:07.110 --> 14:10.312
But are we willing to use it, sir?

14:10.313 --> 14:13.549
I think we just got a signal
through your husband, Bess.

14:13.550 --> 14:17.319
All this Russian President
truly understands or respects

14:17.320 --> 14:18.420
is force.

14:18.421 --> 14:21.524
Give the order to move the fleet.

14:21.525 --> 14:23.191
Yes, sir.

14:29.687 --> 14:36.728
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.250
We've managed to clear
the secretary's schedule,

14:47.251 --> 14:49.084
but one item's proving a little tricky.

14:49.085 --> 14:50.419
And that is?

14:50.420 --> 14:52.755
- Ezra Helsinger's retirement ceremony.
- Oh.

14:52.756 --> 14:55.491
She's expected to give a speech,
or at least make an appearance.

14:55.492 --> 14:56.892
Today's his last day.

14:56.893 --> 14:58.894
I mean, he's a living
legend in the department.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.829
Everyone's gonna be
there, including press.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.865
Yeah. M Sec doesn't show,
there'll be rumors.

15:02.866 --> 15:05.267
I'll let the secretary know.
Keep it on for now.

15:05.268 --> 15:07.336
Speaking of rumors,

15:07.337 --> 15:11.040
I'm hearing the Pentagon's
parking lot is hopping.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.902
You know, people coming
in instead of going home?

15:12.903 --> 15:15.010
- Never a good sign.
- Yup, we're all about to be

15:15.011 --> 15:17.112
fragged by a fiery ball of death.

15:17.113 --> 15:19.448
It was nice to know you.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.616
Daisy, something you should see.

15:22.718 --> 15:24.954
You know the secretary's
so protective of the family?

15:24.955 --> 15:26.689
"Let them say what they will about me,

15:26.690 --> 15:28.290
so long as they leave
the kids out of it"?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.225
Mm-hmm.

15:30.226 --> 15:33.060
The kids are not out of it.

15:34.096 --> 15:36.932
Well, the secretary's
not gonna love this.

15:36.933 --> 15:40.502
But just looks like your
typical Internet rumors.

15:40.503 --> 15:43.339
Daisy, you have a phone call.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.507
It's the secretary's daughter.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.241
Or not.

15:49.011 --> 15:52.081
ADMIRAL HILL: She's at the
mouth of Glacier Bay.

15:52.082 --> 15:54.383
Resting on a seabed in a
hundred meters of water.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.118
DARREN: Well within the 12-mile limit.

15:56.119 --> 15:58.487
And a clear violation of our
territorial sovereignty.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.723
Aerial recon found it when it detected

16:00.724 --> 16:02.524
a burst of very
low-frequency transmission.

16:02.525 --> 16:03.892
They're fairly certain

16:03.893 --> 16:05.127
they were attempting to communicate

16:05.128 --> 16:06.428
with their command vessel.

16:06.429 --> 16:08.197
Since then, nothing.

16:08.198 --> 16:09.398
No distress signal,

16:09.399 --> 16:11.066
no response to our radio transmissions

16:11.067 --> 16:12.668
or hydrophone.

16:12.669 --> 16:14.503
And Ostrov still isn't
picking up his phone.

16:14.504 --> 16:16.605
What's his game, Bess?

16:16.606 --> 16:18.140
Trying to back us out of Latvia...

16:18.141 --> 16:19.975
I thought.

16:19.976 --> 16:22.478
But to be honest, at this moment, sir,

16:22.479 --> 16:23.712
I don't know.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.248
Is there an optic cable
buried along that coast?

16:26.249 --> 16:27.549
It's land-linked to our anti-missile

16:27.550 --> 16:29.051
tracking stations up north.

16:29.052 --> 16:31.086
So, it could be a spy mission
trying to tap that cable.

16:31.087 --> 16:33.922
Yes, and it also has six
nuclear cruise missiles

16:33.923 --> 16:37.459
capable of destroying Juneau
55 miles down that channel!

16:37.460 --> 16:39.461
It could be awaiting orders!

16:39.462 --> 16:42.931
If they wanted to nuke
us, they have ICBM's

16:42.932 --> 16:45.367
that could obliterate
New York in 20 minutes.

16:45.368 --> 16:48.537
Why park a sub off of Alaska?

16:48.538 --> 16:49.972
Juneau would be gone in 30 seconds.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.641
And then the sub would disappear
down the coast, to Seattle,

16:52.642 --> 16:54.176
L.A.

16:54.177 --> 16:57.212
How long before we can
physically engage?

16:57.213 --> 16:58.580
You mean threaten it, sir?

16:58.581 --> 17:00.482
Capture it and report it?

17:00.483 --> 17:02.651
I mean destroy it.

17:02.652 --> 17:04.819
ADMIRAL HILL: Sir,

17:04.820 --> 17:06.355
our closest surface vessel

17:06.356 --> 17:08.490
is the Navy minesweeper <i>Kirkland.</i>

17:08.491 --> 17:10.992
It can be at the site within 90 minutes.

17:10.993 --> 17:13.194
Tell the Russians they have two hours.

17:13.195 --> 17:15.196
Two hours for that sub to be gone.

17:15.198 --> 17:16.432
Or we take it out ourselves.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.032
By whatever means necessary.

17:18.034 --> 17:21.569
Which the Russians will
view as an act of war.

17:21.570 --> 17:23.604
And this isn't?

17:27.542 --> 17:30.845
Can't say we didn't warn them.

17:32.681 --> 17:35.517
ELIZABETH: <i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

17:35.518 --> 17:38.087
So we're gonna pay
tribute to Mr. Helsinger

17:38.088 --> 17:39.521
just like nothing's wrong.

17:39.522 --> 17:40.722
Yes, ma'am.

17:40.723 --> 17:41.757
Is anything wrong?

17:41.758 --> 17:44.359
Uh, nothing we're talking about.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.728
Ma'am, uh, your speech
doesn't need to be formal.

17:46.729 --> 17:49.565
Just a few unrehearsed,
off the cuff remarks.

17:49.566 --> 17:51.433
And here they are.

17:51.434 --> 17:53.969
Great.

17:53.970 --> 17:57.005
Six decades of service in Germany,

17:57.006 --> 17:59.775
Eastern Europe and the Middle East,

17:59.776 --> 18:02.611
a crewman for a Vanderbilt yacht

18:02.612 --> 18:04.880
and a writer for <i>Time</i>
and <i>The Paris Review.</i>

18:04.881 --> 18:06.381
Ezra...

18:06.382 --> 18:09.384
you truly are a witness to
and a creator of what

18:09.385 --> 18:13.055
your first boss, Henry Luce,
called "The American Century."

18:13.056 --> 18:15.524
Thank you.

18:15.525 --> 18:16.892
Enjoy your life.

18:16.893 --> 18:20.494
And have some cake. (laughs)

18:26.635 --> 18:28.804
(indistinct chatter)

18:28.805 --> 18:30.873
Yeah, sure, sure, of course.

18:30.874 --> 18:32.674
Oh, please, don't get up, Ezra.

18:32.675 --> 18:33.842
I'm very sorry.

18:33.843 --> 18:35.611
I was supposed to bring you your gift.

18:35.612 --> 18:37.746
But we're a little disorganized today.

18:37.747 --> 18:39.982
Well, there's no need
to apologize, ma'am.

18:39.983 --> 18:42.551
In threat of war with the Russians?

18:42.552 --> 18:45.487
That's apt to frazzle a person.

18:45.488 --> 18:47.489
And on the very day that

18:47.490 --> 18:48.824
the last of the Cold Warriors

18:48.825 --> 18:51.160
shuffles off to Buffalo, too.

18:51.161 --> 18:53.562
How's that for irony?

18:53.563 --> 18:55.597
Has someone been telling you things?

18:55.598 --> 18:56.765
(chuckles)

18:56.766 --> 19:00.569
I have seen this movie
before, Madam Secretary.

19:00.570 --> 19:03.372
The Russian navy holding war games

19:03.373 --> 19:05.107
in the Bering Sea.

19:05.108 --> 19:07.409
I, uh, I happened to see

19:07.410 --> 19:09.945
a little item on the DOD...

19:09.946 --> 19:11.947
daily rundown this morning.

19:11.948 --> 19:13.282
We are sending

19:13.283 --> 19:15.751
a Naval flagship into the Black Sea.

19:15.752 --> 19:18.954
Ostrov is posturing on Russian TV.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.890
And with your husband, no less.

19:21.891 --> 19:24.359
He's a handsome fella, by the way.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.929
You've cleared your calendar.

19:26.930 --> 19:30.732
Except for those events where
your absence would be noticed.

19:30.733 --> 19:33.635
You really do know how
to read the signs.

19:33.636 --> 19:35.337
Now, tell that to the DMV.

19:35.338 --> 19:37.139
They took my damn license!

19:37.140 --> 19:39.173
(chuckles)

19:40.842 --> 19:42.844
You still work for me.

19:42.845 --> 19:45.480
For the next several hours anyway, right?

19:45.481 --> 19:48.016
Um... yeah.

19:48.017 --> 19:50.418
Till 5:00.

20:01.455 --> 20:04.158
So, there's this invisible submarine...

20:04.159 --> 20:05.759
a super weapon...

20:05.760 --> 20:07.908
it's just sitting there,

20:07.909 --> 20:09.210
letting us look at it.

20:09.211 --> 20:11.146
Right! I was wondering about that, too.

20:11.147 --> 20:14.949
I mean, why turn off
the stealth technology?

20:14.950 --> 20:17.185
Well, back in my day,

20:17.186 --> 20:20.155
we only tried to read
the Russians' intentions.

20:20.156 --> 20:21.756
Their mentality.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.391
To look at the chess player

20:23.392 --> 20:25.293
as well as the pieces on the board.

20:25.294 --> 20:28.062
(sighs) Well, that's sort
of tough since Ostrov

20:28.063 --> 20:29.898
won't even admit there's a game.

20:29.899 --> 20:32.100
(wry chuckle) Not even talking.

20:32.101 --> 20:34.869
But see? That in itself
tells us something.

20:34.870 --> 20:37.705
I mean, he's a bully and a poser, right?

20:37.706 --> 20:39.874
Well, uh, the question is...

20:39.875 --> 20:41.843
why isn't he bragging?

20:41.844 --> 20:44.579
Throwing this in our face?

20:44.580 --> 20:47.382
Right...

20:47.383 --> 20:50.552
right... Why-why not tell
the Russian public...

20:50.553 --> 20:53.021
or the whole world,

20:53.022 --> 20:54.556
for that matter, that he snuck

20:54.557 --> 20:57.926
advanced technology in
right under our noses?

20:57.927 --> 20:59.961
Beat us at our own game.

20:59.962 --> 21:02.230
In our backyard.

21:02.231 --> 21:03.731
And you're right, you know,

21:03.732 --> 21:06.434
it isn't like Ostrov to hold back.

21:06.435 --> 21:09.604
Unless there's something
he didn't count on.

21:09.605 --> 21:12.172
Something went wrong.

21:17.345 --> 21:20.648
That sub isn't doing
what it's supposed to.

21:20.649 --> 21:23.785
And again...

21:23.786 --> 21:26.287
Ostrov would never admit that, would he?

21:26.288 --> 21:28.389
Kind of makes you wish
it was him sitting here now,

21:28.390 --> 21:29.757
instead of me, doesn't it?

21:29.758 --> 21:32.193
So you could ask him.

21:32.194 --> 21:35.663
You do know there's no
smoking in here, right?

21:35.664 --> 21:37.532
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah, yeah. I, uh...

21:37.533 --> 21:39.734
Ordinance against smoking
in this building

21:39.735 --> 21:42.335
since 1997, I think, I...

21:44.272 --> 21:47.074
I miss the war.

22:11.099 --> 22:13.600
♪

22:38.293 --> 22:40.929
You know, I, too, have great
respect for St. Nicholas.

22:40.930 --> 22:42.530
Stop filming.

22:42.531 --> 22:44.265
What are you doing here, Henry?

22:44.266 --> 22:46.534
Your tour of the church is over.

22:46.535 --> 22:48.536
I mean, St. George is great.

22:48.537 --> 22:49.904
The warrior saint.

22:49.905 --> 22:51.372
The victor.

22:51.373 --> 22:53.741
But St. Nick represents compassion.

22:53.742 --> 22:56.611
He's the one you turn to
when times are tough.

22:56.612 --> 22:59.514
Of course, we've trivialized
him in the West,

22:59.515 --> 23:02.550
made him into the precursor
of our modern-day Santa Claus.

23:02.551 --> 23:03.851
What is your point?

23:03.852 --> 23:06.953
Thought that maybe we would
light a candle together.

23:07.655 --> 23:10.158
I don't think so.

23:10.159 --> 23:13.127
I'm in no need of miracles.

23:13.128 --> 23:14.762
You may be.

23:14.763 --> 23:16.663
Not me.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.512
So, we clear?

23:31.513 --> 23:32.513
No more pictures.

23:32.514 --> 23:33.448
Nothing personal.

23:33.449 --> 23:35.650
No posting where others can see.

23:35.651 --> 23:38.619
- And...? - Absolutely nothing
involving the First Family

23:38.620 --> 23:40.021
or the White House.

23:40.022 --> 23:42.557
- Thank you.
- Okay, then, leave it to me.

23:42.558 --> 23:44.625
I'll see what I can do to
keep major news outlets

23:44.626 --> 23:45.994
from picking up the story.

23:45.995 --> 23:46.995
Without telling Mom?

23:46.996 --> 23:48.096
Yeah, no.

23:48.097 --> 23:49.497
DAISY: It'll all be fine.

23:49.498 --> 23:51.899
Besides, the best defense is the truth.

23:51.900 --> 23:54.535
And since you and Harrison
aren't actually an item...

23:54.536 --> 23:56.537
I mean, you'd tell me
if you were, right?

23:56.538 --> 23:58.506
'Cause, honestly, he is kind of cute.

23:58.507 --> 23:59.874
(chuckles)

23:59.875 --> 24:01.175
I mean, I'd understand.

24:01.176 --> 24:03.478
No, I have a boyfriend, okay?

24:03.479 --> 24:05.146
Oh! Oh, yeah? Who's that?

24:05.147 --> 24:07.515
Oh, it's just, uh, this
guy that I work with.

24:07.516 --> 24:09.851
Another intern from the
Microloan program?

24:09.852 --> 24:11.052
Uh...

24:11.053 --> 24:13.321
Wait, what's with the face?

24:13.322 --> 24:15.989
What, are you, like, dating
your boss or something?

24:17.859 --> 24:19.494
Oh, my God.

24:19.495 --> 24:21.162
Wait, are you dating Arthur Gilroy?

24:21.163 --> 24:22.597
Yeah.

24:22.598 --> 24:24.565
- Look, I know it sounds...
- Stevie, no.

24:24.566 --> 24:26.934
Forget Harrison, now we have a problem.

24:26.935 --> 24:28.703
No, Mom and Dad are
fine with it. Sort of.

24:28.704 --> 24:29.871
They may be fine as parents,

24:29.872 --> 24:31.539
but from a press perspective,

24:31.540 --> 24:32.907
looking at damage control...

24:32.908 --> 24:34.575
Stevie, there are three words

24:34.576 --> 24:36.244
that can never go together in this town,

24:36.245 --> 24:38.813
and that is "boss," "intern" and "sex."

24:38.814 --> 24:40.348
You've got to end it. Now.

24:40.349 --> 24:41.382
What?! Why?

24:41.383 --> 24:42.717
What do you think will happen

24:42.718 --> 24:43.918
when it comes out about you two?

24:43.919 --> 24:45.720
And it will, now that
you're in the spotlight.

24:45.721 --> 24:47.755
- I will deal with it.
- The Microloan program was

24:47.756 --> 24:48.856
already on the chopping block.

24:48.857 --> 24:50.058
And don't you think there are people

24:50.059 --> 24:51.759
who would love to get
back at your mother?

24:51.760 --> 24:54.028
And they'd happily throw Arthur Gilroy

24:54.029 --> 24:55.430
onto the fire to do that.

24:55.431 --> 24:57.231
You really think that's
what will happen?

24:57.832 --> 25:00.100
I know it will.

25:02.437 --> 25:05.073
This is St. Nicholas we're talking about?

25:05.074 --> 25:07.675
As in Kris Kringle?

25:07.676 --> 25:10.144
HENRY: He means something
more in Orthodox tradition.

25:10.145 --> 25:12.280
He's the one you turn to
in cases of calamity,

25:12.281 --> 25:14.248
when things have turned against you.

25:14.249 --> 25:15.483
It's just an observation,

25:15.484 --> 25:17.085
but he seemed like a different person,

25:17.086 --> 25:19.554
like he was afraid, even.

25:19.555 --> 25:20.888
Afraid of what?

25:20.889 --> 25:22.156
I don't know,

25:22.157 --> 25:23.658
but I've been around
enough true believers

25:23.659 --> 25:25.460
to know when they're really
praying, and Ostrov was.

25:25.461 --> 25:27.728
The guy that took me
hunting this afternoon

25:27.729 --> 25:29.330
was confident, secure,

25:29.331 --> 25:31.232
like everything was going his way.

25:31.233 --> 25:34.102
Could something have
happened to change that?

25:34.103 --> 25:36.070
Yeah, as a matter of
fact, something did.

25:36.071 --> 25:38.139
Look, Henry, I gotta take
this to the president.

25:38.140 --> 25:39.440
If Ostrov is scared,

25:39.441 --> 25:41.809
it may be because he's
lost control of that sub.

25:41.810 --> 25:43.811
You think he could overreact?

25:43.812 --> 25:45.813
That, or we will.

25:45.814 --> 25:47.213
(dog barks)

25:48.950 --> 25:50.184
At this point, it's academic

25:50.185 --> 25:51.552
- Wait the deadline
- if Ostrov is in control of the sub.

25:51.553 --> 25:53.287
for the <i>Yalta</i> to leave
our waters isn't up yet.

25:53.288 --> 25:54.288
I'm overriding it.

25:54.289 --> 25:55.857
We've got the Russians' response.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.191
Two of their Kirov-class battle cruisers

25:57.192 --> 25:59.527
and three sister attack
subs are on a direct course

25:59.528 --> 26:00.628
to Glacier Bay.

26:00.629 --> 26:01.929
Carrier Strike Group 11 out of Everett

26:01.930 --> 26:03.131
is on its way to intercept.

26:03.132 --> 26:04.465
Meantime, the sub hasn't budged

26:04.466 --> 26:06.267
The <i>Kirkland's</i> stationed
directly over it,

26:06.268 --> 26:08.269
about to commence
dropping depth charges.

26:08.270 --> 26:09.504
Wh-Why?

26:09.505 --> 26:11.205
Standard naval etiquette.

26:11.206 --> 26:13.641
You don't surrender, we
force you to surface.

26:13.642 --> 26:15.343
DECK OFFICER: <i>This is the</i> Kirkland.

26:15.344 --> 26:16.677
<i>We are directly above the target.</i>

26:16.678 --> 26:19.179
<i>We are about to drop depth charges.</i>

26:20.414 --> 26:24.684
Three, two, one...

26:25.987 --> 26:29.356
(shouting in Russian)

26:31.659 --> 26:32.960
DECK OFFICER: Standing by.

26:32.961 --> 26:34.527
There's something happening.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.235
Fish in the water.

26:41.236 --> 26:43.204
Target has launched a torpedo.

26:43.205 --> 26:44.205
Initiating counter...

26:44.206 --> 26:45.605
(explosion thundering)

26:46.607 --> 26:47.875
We are hit.

26:47.876 --> 26:49.877
Repeat, <i>Kirkland</i> has been hit.

26:49.878 --> 26:53.313
Sir, we've lost communication
with the <i>Kirkland.</i>

27:01.492 --> 27:04.572
Carrier Strike Group has re-established
contact with the Kirkland.

27:04.573 --> 27:05.855
Damage assessment?

27:05.856 --> 27:07.656
Injuries. So far, no fatalities.

27:07.657 --> 27:10.159
We have a visual from a medi-chopper.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.294
Ship is still under
power, headed for port.

27:12.295 --> 27:14.163
MAN (over speaker):
NORAD reports a squadron

27:14.164 --> 27:16.232
of Russian MiG-35s just
performed a flyover.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.334
Saw the <i>Kirkland</i> take the hit.

27:18.335 --> 27:19.535
Damn it.

27:19.536 --> 27:22.104
BECKER: Mr. President, I've got NORTHCOM

27:22.105 --> 27:23.939
and the Commander of
the U.S. Pacific Fleet

27:23.940 --> 27:25.741
requesting immediate
authority to engage.

27:25.742 --> 27:28.244
We just got a communiqué
from the Russians.

27:28.245 --> 27:29.745
Their vessel was defending itself,

27:29.746 --> 27:31.514
and any further attack will be met

27:31.515 --> 27:35.017
with quote, "overwhelming
retaliatory force."

27:35.018 --> 27:36.352
Without getting into specifics.

27:36.353 --> 27:37.386
Call their bluff, sir.

27:37.387 --> 27:38.587
They're entirely in the wrong.

27:38.588 --> 27:39.688
They're guilty of an act of war.

27:39.689 --> 27:40.923
Well, all due respect,

27:40.924 --> 27:43.526
we don't know who's guilty of what.

27:43.527 --> 27:45.828
I'm just saying, Mr. President,

27:45.829 --> 27:47.830
before we declare war, let's determine

27:47.831 --> 27:50.065
exactly who we're going to war with.

27:50.066 --> 27:51.200
What if that sub hasn't moved

27:51.201 --> 27:53.202
because it's incapable of moving?

27:53.203 --> 27:54.904
What if something went wrong?

27:54.905 --> 27:57.106
That sub isn't doing
what it's supposed to.

27:57.107 --> 28:00.075
The captain and crew could be
operating without orders,

28:00.076 --> 28:03.012
off the chain of command of
the Kremlin and his president.

28:03.013 --> 28:04.680
What does it matter?
We respond to actions,

28:04.681 --> 28:06.549
Mr. President, not intentions.

28:06.550 --> 28:09.885
We do not let an attack on
American lives go unanswered!

28:09.886 --> 28:12.555
And we don't go to war over a mistake!

28:12.556 --> 28:14.589
Outside.

28:17.893 --> 28:19.462
We should believe that Ostrov
lost control of the <i>Yalta</i>

28:19.463 --> 28:20.763
because your husband knows religion,

28:20.764 --> 28:22.798
and he saw Ostrov ask Santa for a wish?

28:22.799 --> 28:25.034
Actually, the secretary's
husband has shown

28:25.035 --> 28:26.669
he can be a pretty effective operative

28:26.670 --> 28:28.337
on occasion, as well
as a religious scholar.

28:28.338 --> 28:30.706
Well, what if I trust your analysis?

28:30.707 --> 28:31.674
Say Ostrov is scared,

28:31.675 --> 28:33.609
that he's operating in the blind,

28:33.610 --> 28:34.577
like we all are here.

28:34.578 --> 28:35.611
Then what?

28:35.612 --> 28:36.912
Then we don't push him to the brink.

28:36.913 --> 28:38.948
Not until we know more.

28:38.949 --> 28:41.283
Every second we wait lets
those battleships get closer.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.718
Or lets the sub fire another missile...

28:42.719 --> 28:45.187
or six of them, all of them nukes.

28:45.188 --> 28:46.461
And if we hit it with one of ours,

28:46.462 --> 28:48.257
it's got a 10K reactor on board.

28:48.258 --> 28:52.928
We risk sending a radioactive
tsunami down the channel...

28:52.929 --> 28:55.431
That'll make Fukushima a fond
memory... I get it, Bess.

28:55.432 --> 28:58.467
So what do you propose?

28:58.468 --> 29:00.870
We have to take one last chance,

29:00.871 --> 29:02.538
and try and talk to that submarine.

29:02.539 --> 29:05.975
Directly and without Moscow knowing.

29:05.976 --> 29:08.409
There has to be a way.

29:10.179 --> 29:12.781
ADMIRAL HILL: That's the
unmanned submersible.

29:12.782 --> 29:14.850
If the Russian crew gets a visual,

29:14.851 --> 29:17.185
they'll know it's harmless,
incapable of attack.

29:19.088 --> 29:20.756
We're tapping on their hull.

29:20.757 --> 29:24.159
We're using the retractable
arm to tap out a message.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.095
(electronic beeping)

29:26.096 --> 29:28.097
Morse code.

29:28.098 --> 29:30.431
Old school, but it works.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.802
HILL: We're asking them to
state their name, mission,

29:33.803 --> 29:34.803
allow us on board.

29:34.804 --> 29:38.207
(Morse code beeping)

29:38.208 --> 29:39.874
That's them answering.

29:40.809 --> 29:42.478
(Morse code beeping)

29:42.479 --> 29:44.413
There's activity.

29:44.414 --> 29:47.616
One of her torpedo tubes
is opening, flooding...

29:47.617 --> 29:49.217
She's gonna fire.

29:54.390 --> 29:57.026
No, it's her distress buoy.

29:57.027 --> 29:58.760
They're asking for help.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.979
Stephanie!

30:16.980 --> 30:19.014
Are you and Harrison Dalton dating?

30:19.015 --> 30:21.149
Is he a good kisser?

30:22.318 --> 30:24.552
REPORTER: Are you and
Harrison Dalton dating?

30:25.187 --> 30:28.023
Hey, you okay?

30:28.024 --> 30:30.159
Yeah, I'm not used to being ambushed.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.528
Yeah, you have a lot of pings.

30:32.529 --> 30:35.197
You're getting some serious
unwanted attention.

30:35.198 --> 30:36.532
Yeah, they were outside my house.

30:36.533 --> 30:37.900
And then on the street.

30:37.901 --> 30:39.501
- It's crazy.
- All right, don't worry about it.

30:39.502 --> 30:41.403
You and Harrison are
just filling bandwidth

30:41.404 --> 30:42.671
between Kardashians.

30:42.672 --> 30:44.373
- (chuckles)
- It's gonna blow over soon.

30:44.374 --> 30:45.507
None of this matters.

30:45.508 --> 30:47.943
Listen to me... what matters is our work.

30:47.944 --> 30:51.612
The microloans program...
that's what matters.

30:53.449 --> 30:55.851
Yeah, about that.

30:55.852 --> 30:58.619
Hey, you're not quitting, are you?

31:03.425 --> 31:05.761
Oh, you're quitting this.

31:05.762 --> 31:07.129
Us.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.797
Both, I'm quitting...

31:08.798 --> 31:09.898
I'm quitting both.

31:09.899 --> 31:11.567
Once they figure out

31:11.568 --> 31:13.535
that I'm not dating Harrison,

31:13.536 --> 31:15.904
they're going to figure
out who I am dating.

31:15.905 --> 31:17.940
So what?

31:17.941 --> 31:19.608
You really want to throw away

31:19.609 --> 31:21.543
your whole career on some intern?

31:21.544 --> 31:23.212
Listen to me, I know I've
harped on this a lot,

31:23.213 --> 31:25.214
but I-I have been around, okay?

31:25.215 --> 31:27.616
Just let me... let me worry about that.

31:27.617 --> 31:29.685
Look, okay, you know what?

31:29.686 --> 31:31.819
You're too old.

31:35.357 --> 31:38.326
You're too old, and it's not gonna work.

31:41.664 --> 31:42.998
(scoffs)

31:42.999 --> 31:45.399
Is that what you need to hear?

31:46.235 --> 31:47.503
Uh, okay.

31:47.504 --> 31:48.937
(clears throat) Okay.

31:48.938 --> 31:50.372
Well, it's been really
nice working with you...

31:50.373 --> 31:51.774
Listen to me... do you
really want to lose

31:51.775 --> 31:53.842
what means so much to <i>you?</i>

31:53.843 --> 31:58.247
Please, just take a few days,
and think about the job, not me.

31:58.248 --> 32:00.514
The job.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.620
Okay.

32:07.089 --> 32:08.789
I have to go.

32:11.727 --> 32:13.228
See you around, kid.

32:13.229 --> 32:14.929
(wry laugh)

32:17.232 --> 32:19.934
See you around, old man.

32:31.947 --> 32:34.249
(speaking Russian)

32:34.250 --> 32:36.151
TRANSLATOR: He's the executive officer

32:36.152 --> 32:38.353
of the Russian submarine, the <i>Yalta.</i>

32:38.354 --> 32:39.955
They're transmitting from the bridge.

32:39.956 --> 32:42.958
They have an antenna attached
to their distress buoy.

32:42.959 --> 32:48.130
They suffered a malfunction
when the new technology failed.

32:48.131 --> 32:51.633
There was a fire in the control
room, they couldn't contain it.

32:51.634 --> 32:54.203
A loss of oxygen...

32:54.204 --> 32:56.038
(speaking Russian)

32:56.039 --> 32:59.274
"42 crew members have already died."

32:59.275 --> 33:02.311
That's two-thirds of their crew.

33:02.312 --> 33:06.048
"The captain broke radio
silence to report it.

33:06.049 --> 33:08.082
"We received instructions:

33:09.218 --> 33:11.120
"Do not signal for help.

33:11.121 --> 33:14.590
"Do not allow the Americans to board.

33:14.591 --> 33:17.192
"If you can't restore power,
then destroy the sub

33:17.193 --> 33:19.828
and all evidence of new
deflector technology."

33:19.829 --> 33:22.731
Anything to keep us from
getting our hands on it.

33:22.732 --> 33:24.199
Ask why they fired the torpedo.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.602
(translator speaking Russian)

33:29.805 --> 33:31.039
(speaking Russian)

33:31.040 --> 33:32.040
"The captain panicked..."

33:32.041 --> 33:34.610
(executive officer speaking Russian)

33:34.611 --> 33:38.480
TRANSLATOR: He thought
they were being attacked.

33:38.481 --> 33:41.183
(executive officer speaking Russian)

33:41.184 --> 33:44.720
"The captain's no longer
in command of the vessel."

33:44.721 --> 33:47.488
Nice way of saying they mutinied.

33:48.824 --> 33:51.160
(executive officer speaks Russian, gasps)

33:51.161 --> 33:53.061
"We only have two hours of oxygen left.

33:53.062 --> 33:54.830
"We're asking for your help.

33:54.831 --> 33:56.431
Please help us."

33:56.432 --> 33:57.966
(speaking Russian)

33:57.967 --> 34:00.569
"Please...

34:00.570 --> 34:03.270
help us."

34:08.543 --> 34:10.779
BECKER: Mr. President, the
Russian battle cruiser

34:10.780 --> 34:12.313
has just reached our line of quarantine.

34:12.315 --> 34:13.815
DARREN: We tell the
Russians we're going down

34:13.817 --> 34:15.751
to get those men out, they will refuse.

34:15.752 --> 34:16.752
BECKER: And they're close enough now

34:16.753 --> 34:17.820
to send out a missile of their own,

34:17.821 --> 34:19.121
and destroy it themselves

34:19.121 --> 34:20.589
before we'll get a chance to touch it.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.924
DALTON: So, no good options.

34:25.761 --> 34:27.830
Ostrov will never admit failure,

34:27.831 --> 34:30.232
concede that one of his crews mutinied.

34:30.233 --> 34:31.998
Not in public.

34:33.802 --> 34:35.737
There may be a way to resolve this.

34:35.737 --> 34:38.507
A deal that even he can live with.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.442
But we're gonna need to
go through back channels.

34:40.443 --> 34:44.110
And we happen to have one.

34:45.746 --> 34:48.382
We do.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.642
OSTROV: <i>It's an interesting offer.</i>

34:58.643 --> 35:00.931
President Dalton will confirm it's real.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.265
You can call him directly.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.667
I'm sure it's genuine,

35:03.668 --> 35:06.870
but I wonder if there are alternatives.

35:06.871 --> 35:08.371
The alternative is a return

35:08.372 --> 35:10.639
to the days of the Cold War, sir.

35:14.044 --> 35:16.112
There was a time when our two countries,

35:16.113 --> 35:17.481
our two grandfathers,

35:17.482 --> 35:19.483
fought on the same side.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.852
Mine survived a siege, too: Bastogne.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.720
The Battle of the Bulge.

35:23.721 --> 35:25.956
At the end of the war,
he exchanged cigarettes

35:25.957 --> 35:28.558
with Russian soldiers,
on the Elbe River.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.027
Traveling here, I thought of him.

35:31.028 --> 35:32.496
He would've been happy.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.931
He knew, firsthand, what our countries

35:34.932 --> 35:37.733
could accomplish when they work
together for the common good.

35:39.503 --> 35:42.571
I wear this in honor of mine.

35:47.344 --> 35:48.411
St. Nicholas.

35:48.412 --> 35:52.382
My grandfather's name-saint.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.818
Nikolai is an old family name.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.355
He, too, may have been
happy to see us... here...

35:58.356 --> 36:00.991
in peace.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.227
Perhaps this is what he
sacrificed so much for.

36:08.064 --> 36:10.599
I will call your president.

36:18.669 --> 36:21.402
NEWS ANCHOR (on TV): ...after an
accidental, nighttime collision

36:21.403 --> 36:24.001
between the Russian
nuclear-powered submarine

36:24.002 --> 36:25.836
and the U.S. minesweeper <i>Kirkland,</i>

36:25.837 --> 36:28.119
the disabled sub then drifted

36:28.120 --> 36:30.321
into American territorial waters.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.691
U.S. naval personnel boarded it,
in an attempted rescue.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.327
Tragically, they found no survivors.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.262
- Crew members will be buried at sea
- Those poor guys.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.434
- and the hulk of the sub will be returned
- What a way to go.

36:40.435 --> 36:42.077
- to its home port of Vladivostok.
- I'm just glad that things

36:42.078 --> 36:43.602
didn't escalate with Russia.

36:43.603 --> 36:45.136
(turns off TV)

36:45.137 --> 36:46.938
Look who I brought.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.006
JAY: Mr. Helsinger.

36:48.007 --> 36:49.407
We thought you'd left.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.842
Your tour of duty ended yesterday.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.280
Well, I figured one more
day wouldn't matter.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.049
Also, they told me I still
had to pick up my gift.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.618
Oh, yes...

36:59.619 --> 37:02.053
the secretary wanted to give
that to you personally.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.289
If you don't mind, it'll
just be a few more minutes.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.657
I'll wait.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.127
Getting used to that, waiting.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.598
EZRA: Oh, yeah.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.670
Interesting how all that
turned out, isn't it?

37:18.671 --> 37:20.038
- Very sad story.
- Uh-huh.

37:20.039 --> 37:23.507
But Defense is handling it;
we had nothing to do with it.

37:24.442 --> 37:28.113
Still, it is very interesting.

37:28.114 --> 37:30.480
And it is a story. (wry chuckle)

37:31.883 --> 37:35.619
Kind of makes you wonder
what really happened.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.827
DALTON: These are all of them?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.429
All 20 survivors of the <i>Yalta.</i>

37:44.430 --> 37:45.730
A few hours ago.

37:45.731 --> 37:49.000
Being given a top-secret and
strictly classified welcome

37:49.001 --> 37:51.202
aboard the USS <i>Teddy Roosevelt.</i>

37:51.203 --> 37:53.271
The Russians will be announcing

37:53.272 --> 37:55.774
that their remains have
been buried at sea,

37:55.775 --> 37:59.611
so we'll leave it to them to
make sure the story holds up.

37:59.612 --> 38:03.647
As you said, they are
good at refuting reality.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.950
Ostrov accepted the deal?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.018
JACKSON: Yes, sir.

38:07.019 --> 38:08.253
They'll all get new lives

38:08.254 --> 38:10.755
and identities, here
in the United States.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.058
The price for letting us rescue them.

38:13.059 --> 38:14.192
Unbelievable.

38:14.193 --> 38:16.161
ELIZABETH: In fairness,
sir, we did get a chance

38:16.162 --> 38:17.362
to board that sub

38:17.363 --> 38:19.197
and take a good look at the
new stealth technology

38:19.198 --> 38:21.099
before giving it back.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.167
And at least those poor bastards

38:22.168 --> 38:24.234
won't get sent home and shot for mutiny.

38:24.969 --> 38:28.440
But they will never see
their families again,

38:28.441 --> 38:32.477
not even to let them
know that they're alive.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.213
Any contact puts their
loved ones in danger.

38:35.214 --> 38:37.248
DALTON: All so that
Ostrov could save face.

38:37.249 --> 38:39.684
Hell of a thing.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.386
JACKSON: Sir, the NATO forces

38:41.387 --> 38:43.788
are still deploying to Latvia and the...

38:43.789 --> 38:46.591
<i>Yalta</i> situation didn't
spiral out of control.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.827
We won this round.

38:48.828 --> 38:50.762
Yeah.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.264
The world did not blow up on our watch.

38:53.265 --> 38:56.667
For at least another day or two.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.776
EZRA: Probably my first day on the job.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.447
I could not believe I was
meeting the Old Man.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.486
Whoa! Is that John Foster Dulles?

39:14.487 --> 39:15.653
(chuckling): Yeah.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.455
The architect of permanent
peace in Europe.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.190
Who stood up to Soviet aggression.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.954
ELIZABETH: That picture was taken
the day that President Eisenhower

39:21.955 --> 39:23.744
and Secretary Dulles signed the treaty

39:23.745 --> 39:26.146
bringing Germany into NATO.

39:26.147 --> 39:29.115
EZRA: He always said that
"The ability to get to the verge

39:29.116 --> 39:32.419
"without getting into the war...

39:32.420 --> 39:36.455
- is the..."
- "...the necessary art."

39:37.724 --> 39:41.026
Would you guys give us a minute?

39:41.628 --> 39:43.129
Congratulations, sir.

39:43.664 --> 39:45.532
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

39:45.533 --> 39:47.066
Mine.

39:48.902 --> 39:51.538
Never even asked you
where you were going.

39:51.539 --> 39:54.608
Oh, um... Prague.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.143
Budapest, Berlin.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.946
You ever think you'd
live to see the day?

39:58.947 --> 40:00.614
When the Wall came down,

40:00.615 --> 40:02.716
open borders, free elections?

40:02.717 --> 40:03.884
(wry chuckle) Sometimes we wondered

40:03.885 --> 40:05.719
if we'd live to see the
next five minutes.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.753
(both chuckle)

40:06.754 --> 40:08.956
But, somehow, we understood

40:08.957 --> 40:12.192
that, uh, if we just kept talking...

40:12.193 --> 40:15.562
In the end, the Soviets didn't
want to push that button.

40:15.563 --> 40:17.431
Any more than we did.

40:17.432 --> 40:19.666
There was a, um...

40:19.667 --> 40:21.835
a rationality to it,

40:21.836 --> 40:24.004
crazy as it seems.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.907
Mutually Assured Destruction.

40:26.908 --> 40:29.743
Yeah, but your new enemies today...

40:29.744 --> 40:31.511
they have no such qualms.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.381
They <i>want</i> to push that button...

40:34.382 --> 40:37.017
and there's no holding them back.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.219
That's a bit grim, isn't it?

40:39.220 --> 40:40.854
(wry chuckle)

40:40.855 --> 40:42.288
(sighing): I don't know.

40:43.523 --> 40:47.660
Makes me feel naive for being hopeful.

40:48.362 --> 40:51.498
Oh, you'll be fine.

40:51.499 --> 40:54.600
I've seen a lot of them come and go.

40:55.435 --> 40:57.503
I think you're the one for the job.

41:03.643 --> 41:05.212
Ezra...

41:05.213 --> 41:06.812
Madam Secretary?

41:08.949 --> 41:11.550
You and I should keep talking.

41:19.693 --> 41:22.129
Well, for what it's worth,

41:22.130 --> 41:25.764
Ali feels terrible about "Starrison."

41:26.433 --> 41:28.135
I know she does. It's okay.

41:28.136 --> 41:32.071
And I'm sorry about... "Starthur."

41:32.672 --> 41:35.374
Let's not go crazy with the names.

41:36.476 --> 41:41.515
I think that you did a very adult thing.

41:41.516 --> 41:44.718
But I know it was hard, and I'm
so sorry that you're hurting.

41:44.719 --> 41:45.786
Come here.

41:45.787 --> 41:48.021
- Thanks.
- Sweetie.

41:48.022 --> 41:50.589
Well, at least Dad will be overjoyed.

41:51.358 --> 41:53.026
But he'll hide it well,

41:53.027 --> 41:55.662
which is all you can ask for.

41:55.663 --> 41:57.696
Mm-hmm.

41:58.632 --> 42:00.400
This is nice, by the way.

42:00.401 --> 42:02.269
You going to an event tonight?

42:02.270 --> 42:05.005
I am. The McCord family dinner.

42:05.006 --> 42:06.673
Soon as Dad gets back.

42:06.674 --> 42:08.408
Oh...

42:08.409 --> 42:10.610
Yeah, I don't, I don't
know if I'm up for that.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.712
Well, get up for it.

42:12.713 --> 42:13.713
We're celebrating.

42:13.714 --> 42:15.382
Why?

42:15.383 --> 42:17.784
(sighs) Because we can.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.153
Because we're here.

42:20.154 --> 42:22.456
JASON: Dad's home!

42:22.457 --> 42:23.557
Come on, get your coats!

42:23.558 --> 42:26.159
We found a place with
awesome vegan options.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.260
I did.

42:27.261 --> 42:28.728
(quiet laugh)

42:28.729 --> 42:29.663
That's nice.

42:29.664 --> 42:31.731
Listen, I just want you to know

42:31.732 --> 42:34.067
that even when it's hard,

42:34.068 --> 42:36.269
and no matter how much
it hurts right now,

42:36.270 --> 42:40.105
it is not the end of the world, okay?

42:40.640 --> 42:42.476
HENRY: Where are they?

42:42.477 --> 42:43.910
- There they are... hey!
- Hey, you...

42:43.911 --> 42:44.911
(gentle laugh)

42:44.912 --> 42:46.813
I missed you guys.

42:46.814 --> 42:47.948
What do you think?

42:47.949 --> 42:49.082
Oh, I think it's awful.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.083
Yeah. Hi.

42:50.084 --> 42:52.319
- Hi.
- Oh, Mom texted me.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.453
I'm so sorry, honey.

42:53.454 --> 42:54.721
Nice try, Dad.

42:54.722 --> 42:56.189
I mean it, honey.

42:56.190 --> 42:58.750
- JASON: Hey...
- Come on, let's get some food, please.

42:58.751 --> 43:00.010
- Yes.
- JASON: Let's go, guys.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.858
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, let me just get my coat.

43:01.859 --> 43:04.921
- ALISON: Dad, can I wear the hat?
- HENRY: No.
