01:15.409 --> 01:17.493
So what, she's like your
girlfriend now or something?

01:17.494 --> 01:17.954
No.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.082
I don't know.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.076
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:58.243 --> 01:59.118
See that there?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.745
That was fuckin'
air time there.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.079
Ready to learn, kid?

02:02.080 --> 02:02.956
Yeah.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.343
Here we go.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.209
I like to go in slow
and deep, you know?

02:06.210 --> 02:09.628
You know what I'm
talking about there?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.922
Does that
embarrass you there?

02:10.923 --> 02:11.903
Oh, yeah.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.466
Ha, ha, ha, he is.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.010
Look at you, you're
fuckin' embarrassed.

02:16.011 --> 02:16.969
Are you blushing?

02:16.970 --> 02:17.845
It's the way you say it.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.764
- You're blushing.
- Holy shit.

02:19.765 --> 02:20.514
Oh, yeah.

02:20.515 --> 02:20.973
That's one.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.766
Next one.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.725
One hand.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.434
One hand?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.685
Oh, fuck me.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.021
If you got to use two,
I'd fuckin' shoot you.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.689
What's the... the next one?

02:28.690 --> 02:42.204
250, 250.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.040
Yeah.

02:45.207 --> 02:45.706
- That's fuckin'
you right there.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.499
Oh, yeah.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.083
All fuckin' day.

02:47.084 --> 02:47.625
Oh, yeah.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.000
Casper.

02:48.001 --> 02:48.601
<i>Oh...</i>

02:51.380 --> 02:52.172
Casper.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.091
What?

02:54.258 --> 02:55.132
Did you get my text?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.970
I've texted you like twice.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.555
Uh, no.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.098
Guess I didn't.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.850
Must have been them Canadian
signals there, you know.

03:04.851 --> 03:05.893
- OK, let me
see your phone.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.494
What?

03:06.520 --> 03:07.729
Relax.

03:07.896 --> 03:08.813
Fuck, man.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.648
When...

03:09.815 --> 03:10.773
- I need to
talk to you, OK?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.514
Let's go outside.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.112
Come on.

03:15.279 --> 03:18.991
So why did the
cow cross the road?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.449
- I'm not in
the mood, Casper,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.990
- He wanted to go to the moo
- vies.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.478
My little sister
likes that one, so.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.656
- Where were
you this morning?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.173
What?

03:35.340 --> 03:35.923
Why are you so...

03:35.924 --> 03:38.302
I needed you.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.052
OK?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.556
And you... look.

03:46.435 --> 03:50.315
Uh, I don't know
how to tell you this.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.650
What?

03:53.817 --> 03:56.567
Did someone die
or something?

03:56.653 --> 03:58.013
I'm pregnant.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.677
I'm fucking pregnant.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.091
God.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.858
I need you, OK?

04:29.728 --> 04:32.105
Can we make it work?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.462
Will you make it work?

04:38.862 --> 04:40.572
Uh.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.199
Uh.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.802
Do you love me?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.252
Casper?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.004
What?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.121
Can we just then...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.305
Sorry.

05:05.472 --> 05:09.725
- I'm not- I- we- just
don't apologize, you know?

05:09.726 --> 05:13.020
Just my
- just don't... just don't worry about it.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.563
Just give me some time.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.523
I'll figure it out.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.817
But don't worry
about it, OK?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.840
I'll figure it out.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.952
I'II
- I'm Casper fucking Cote.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.619
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.451
I'm going to go
figure it, OK?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, I'll call you.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.271
<i>I'II- I'II- I'll
catch you later.</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:05.157
- OK, so has anyone here
ever heard of the Jim twins?

06:05.323 --> 06:06.574
The Jim twins.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.366
No one?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.159
All of you?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.327
OK.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.247
Jim Lewis and Jim Springer
were identical twins,

06:13.248 --> 06:15.541
separated at birth,
given up for adoption

06:15.542 --> 06:18.294
and raised by different
families in different parts

06:18.295 --> 06:22.756
of the country, unaware
that the other even existed.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.177
And then one day when they
were 39 years old, they met.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.846
And they got to
talking, and guess what?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.598
They found out that
they both married

06:30.599 --> 06:33.100
women named Betty,
had gotten divorced,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.811
and remarried to
women named Linda.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.399
They both had sons
named James Alan.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.859
They both bit their
nails and had migraines.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.112
They both went to the
exact same beach in FlÃ³rida

06:45.113 --> 06:47.653
for vacation, both of them.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.576
They both love
NASCAR, hated baseball.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.245
They both voted the
same, drank the same beer,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.498
smoked the same cigarettes.

06:55.499 --> 06:59.877
When it was all said and
done, they both died apart

06:59.878 --> 07:02.755
on the same day from
the same illness.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.298
That's fucked up.

07:04.299 --> 07:08.428
- Well
- yeah, that's fucked up.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.639
We don't say that,
but yeah, it is.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.641
- So just think about how
maybe some of those choices,

07:13.642 --> 07:17.269
maybe they're
- maybe they aren't choices at all.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.439
Maybe some things are
beyond your control.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.609
And so now, going back to
the story, well, where do you

07:23.610 --> 07:27.530
guys think that Pony Boy falls in
- in all this?

07:27.531 --> 07:29.865
Because certainly he's dealing
with a lot of peer pressure,

07:29.866 --> 07:30.659
right?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.326
There's a lot of pressure.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.494
He's hanging outwith his
older brother, with Soda Pop,

07:33.495 --> 07:34.745
with all these guys.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.913
So where do you think
he falls in all this?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.206
Anyone got an id
- Casper?

07:37.207 --> 07:39.208
- Can I go to the
bathroom, please?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.085
We're about five
minutes away.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.586
You can hold it.

07:42.587 --> 07:47.167
You want to take your
boots off the table there?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.094
Right.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.001
Genius.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.388
Great.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.556
Take your socks off, or
you're going to the office.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.306
Take your socks off.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.933
That's good.

07:55.934 --> 07:56.892
That's great.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.935
- I'm doing what
you're saying.

07:57.936 --> 07:58.394
Yeah, please.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.396
OK, good.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.105
Now you can take your
feet off the desk.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.156
Smart guy.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.358
Fuck.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.192
Now I got to put the socks
and shoes back on, man.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.860
You could have just
said that there.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.612
Well, I could have.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.365
- Would have been
- jeez, your room's a mess here, teach.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.575
My room's a mess?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.743
Yeah.

08:13.910 --> 08:14.952
One more out of you,

08:14.953 --> 08:16.203
and you're going
down to the office.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.955
- Well, I got to go to
the bathroom anyways.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.206
Hey, you want detention?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.041
- Yeah, sure, teach,
give me detention.

08:21.042 --> 08:21.792
Yeah, it's a big joke,

08:21.793 --> 08:22.960
right, big tough guy?

08:22.961 --> 08:25.296
Everyone's aware
you're such a tough guy.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.630
<i>- I'll show you a
fuckin' tough guy.</i>

08:26.631 --> 08:28.674
You want me to show you
fuckin' tough guy, teach?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.009
I'm not, because you're
starting to fuckin'

08:30.010 --> 08:30.968
piss me off right now.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.178
All right.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.929
One more word out
of you, and you're...

08:33.929 --> 08:35.431
Yeah, you said that
five fuckin' words...

08:35.432 --> 08:35.806
All right, get out.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.347
Get out.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.640
Yeah, fuck me.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.811
Here.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.815
OK, easy.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.065
Hey, old Pony Boy.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.151
Good people
make bad choices.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.944
It's fuckin' easy.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.197
I'm smarter than you.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.951
So you and Casper

08:55.952 --> 09:00.290
would move to
Boston together?

09:03.668 --> 09:05.545
Yeah.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.505
Yeah?

09:07.672 --> 09:08.132
OK.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.053
But not...

09:15.055 --> 09:16.555
COUNSELOR Dominic...

09:16.556 --> 09:18.766
So you've been
coming to this school

09:18.767 --> 09:20.851
since you were six
years old, right?

09:20.852 --> 09:21.853
Right?

09:22.020 --> 09:22.646
Yeah.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.521
And now you're 17.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.472
That's 2/3 of your
life you spent here.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.402
Guess I know
you pretty well.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.404
L
- I know your family.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.408
I know your circumstances.

09:35.575 --> 09:43.083
And it really angers me that
you might throw it all away.

09:43.249 --> 09:48.588
- I would imagine
that you've got a plan.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.215
You've got a plan
beyond high school.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.925
Have you even thought
about which colleges

09:52.926 --> 09:54.301
you might like to try?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.844
- You act like you
want to be punished.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.888
You act like you want to
be thrown out of school.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.182
You act like you
want to be a failure.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.726
Here's what I
want you to do.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.311
I want you take the break.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.064
And if you want to come back to
this school, please come back.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.273
But apply yourself.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.316
Follow the rules.

10:09.317 --> 10:09.858
Work hard.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.111
Behave!

10:11.277 --> 10:13.696
Or don't bother coming back.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.987
You're done.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.826
He's kind of a dick.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.327
Well, fuck him.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.019
Fuck him.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.339
Oh, he says you've got
a bright future, though.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.810
- He said I've got
a bright future?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.512
Yeah.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.763
Yeah.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.890
He started jerking off,
just thinking about you.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.267
It's the truth too.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.148
Yeah, he does that.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.073
Get off.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.560
Badger's down at Tulsa.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.518
Go there.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.519
Is that you, Clayton?

12:50.520 --> 12:54.524
- I said, Badger
is down at Tulsa.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.482
Go there.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.483
OK, OK, OK.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.445
Jesse, go there.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.613
Jesse!

13:00.780 --> 13:04.701
Jesse, get out of my
- get off my por...

13:04.868 --> 13:07.028
close the fucking door.

13:35.023 --> 13:35.731
That's it.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.262
It's in there.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.755
- What's wrong
with Clayton?

13:48.870 --> 13:49.953
What do you mean?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.455
- Wouldn't even
open the door.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.998
- You don't know
better than that?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.125
He don't like doing
business at home.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.170
Besides, he don't
trust no one but family.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.840
- Or fuckin'
second cousins.

14:01.007 --> 14:01.757
Second cousins?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.259
<i>- Mm
- hmm.</i>

14:03.426 --> 14:05.052
That's all family.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.012
Everybody's a second
cousin to everybody.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.431
<i>- Mm
- hmm.</i>

14:08.598 --> 14:09.932
You don't trust
no one but me, OK?

14:09.933 --> 14:10.849
<i>- Mm
- hmm.</i>

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
Look at me.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.561
You don't trust
no one but me.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.188
- Yeah, I don't
trust no one but you,

14:16.189 --> 14:18.440
but- ahem- your
brother's a weird dude.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.733
- You're a
fuckin' weird dude.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.986
Get the fuck out.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.488
Get out.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.907
Take your powdered donuts
and get the fuck out.

14:26.908 --> 14:27.888
Fuck you.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.446
Fuck me?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.543
Well, fuck you,
all right, Sal?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.379
Hmm?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.879
Sorry about that.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.620
That guy was bad.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.966
I don't like that guy.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.327
That guy was a bad guy.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.533
Hey, how'd it go?

15:09.534 --> 15:10.742
Good, I think, you know.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.786
Um, got a bottle of
big dogs there, yeah.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.578
Big dogs?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.414
Yeah.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.497
- That's a good
score there.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.666
Yeah.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.583
And, uh, something that
I think are hydros, maybe.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.626
- Well yeah,
I'll take a look.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.087
OK.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.385
Yes, sir.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.387
Hydros.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.929
That's real good.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.639
- I can do that whenever
you need, you know.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.473
- Uh
- hein.

15:33.474 --> 15:33.849
Yeah.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.768
Book it.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.894
Looks like a rock there.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.845
Fantastic.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.862
And how is your, uh...
how's your cunt mother?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.238
I don't know.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.614
She's always in a bad
mood, that one there, yeah.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.240
I know.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.201
Yeah.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.494
Yeah.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.328
Has she shit out any
more kids since I've last

15:55.329 --> 15:56.580
seen her dumb ass?

15:56.581 --> 15:59.461
- Um
- I don't think so, no.

15:59.584 --> 16:06.340
- Well, um, tell her fuck you
from your old man, will you?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.468
Sure, yeah.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.801
- Yeah, well,
I'll call you.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.636
Or just come by anytime.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.263
Yeah?

16:12.430 --> 16:12.929
- Uh
- hein.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.050
Yeah, sure.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.475
All right.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.142
I'II
- I'll be by, or you call me then, you know?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.646
- I know, but I...
I will call you.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.413
Good.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.613
Why are you crying?

16:29.614 --> 16:30.989
'Cause I'm so...

16:30.990 --> 16:34.534
- 'Cause, 'cause, 'cause
you want a gold, gold, fish?

16:34.535 --> 16:35.203
What?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.412
- I got to go get
- Michael!

16:37.413 --> 16:38.288
Where's Mom?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.414
Hey, where's Mom?

16:39.415 --> 16:42.001
She went for a nap.

16:42.168 --> 16:42.542
A what?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.920
"A nap!

16:44.087 --> 16:45.879
That's where she is, hein?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.047
You eat lunch yet?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.632
Hey, go upstairs, you guys.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.591
Yeah, you.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.593
Upstairs.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.594
Gerard, take them
upstairs there.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.012
Follow Gerard there.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.472
I don't want to
go to take a nap!

16:55.473 --> 16:56.014
I know.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.025
It's OK.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.058
But Gerard will
take care of you.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.852
I want Mama!

17:09.444 --> 17:12.571
- You ever been shot with
a potato cannon, Dayton?

17:12.573 --> 17:13.032
No.

17:13.199 --> 17:13.866
"No?

17:14.032 --> 17:14.825
I bet it would hurt?

17:14.826 --> 17:15.976
DON'T you?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.496
Probably would, yeah.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.097
Yeah.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.834
You want to see?

17:24.417 --> 17:25.545
OK.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.172
How about this?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.548
I sit here for 30 seconds.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.049
If you can get
that thing loaded,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.176
<i>I"II let you
shoot me with it.</i>

17:33.177 --> 17:35.720
- What are you
doing here, you?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.305
I live here, Kim.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.391
- I told you not to bring
that thing in the house.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.976
- Oh, I could say
the same thing to you.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.927
OK, mister big shot.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.438
You want to start paying rent,
you can start having a say.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.024
- Uh, I'm
- I'm still... I'm still 17, Kim.

17:48.025 --> 17:52.465
Don't you get enough
money from me being here?

17:53.865 --> 17:55.198
I'm sorry, baby.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.799
It's all right.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.921
I put on the moose video.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.256
Penelope started crying.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.926
Oh, did she?

18:14.093 --> 18:14.968
Oh, yeah.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.178
Dad says, fuck you!

18:16.179 --> 18:18.579
Yeah, well, fuck him too.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.192
I'm going to be late.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.610
You've got like an hour.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.738
- Well, it's going to take
me that long if I'm lucky.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.489
The car's making that
weird noise again.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.116
Are you going to
be here for supper?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.618
- No, I'm going to the
Tasty Food with Casper, so.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.079
Oh.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.500
What?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.027
Well, it'll have to do.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.623
Come on!

20:56.630 --> 20:57.160
Car.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.438
Well, I don't hear it.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.439
OK.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.516
Come on.

22:06.909 --> 22:11.371
- Are we spraying them for
bugs to protect the flowers?

22:11.372 --> 22:14.083
It's called Sugar Mover.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.334
It's like a fertilizer.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.086
But it doesn't
protect the flowers.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.340
It kills the flowers.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.925
But why?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.884
- We need to
protect the potato.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.096
We don't want the flower to
suck up all the nutrients.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.639
We need it to
go to the tuber.

22:29.640 --> 22:34.353
That way it has a stronger,
better, healthier life.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.440
If we don't, the
potatoes won't survive.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.114
It's not easy.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.158
Farmer to make a
living, it's not easy.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.826
You'll get sick and
tired of looking at these,

22:49.827 --> 22:51.119
I guarantee it.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.247
But you harvest them
right and put them

22:54.248 --> 22:57.041
in the proper
environment, and they'II

22:57.042 --> 22:58.626
last you a good long time.

22:58.627 --> 23:03.757
All right, let's go, uh,
pull them out of the ground.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.177
You know how I
feel about you, Dom.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.803
You've always
got a place here.

23:50.804 --> 23:56.274
You're a hell of a hard
worker, and you're a smart kid.

24:00.147 --> 24:00.981
"Dom?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.148
Yeah, what?

24:02.149 --> 24:02.983
Help.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.568
Hold on.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.125
I'll get it.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.687
Fine, I'm going
to walk over here.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.862
Jeez, fucking
rocks are heavy.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.471
You know, it's weird.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.014
L
- I see you at school all the time,

24:35.015 --> 24:37.559
but we never
really get to talk.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.979
- Yeah, it's like, uh,
harvest friends, right?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.480
Like Austin and
I, when, you know,

24:42.481 --> 24:45.066
we always talk during the
harvest, but go back to school,

24:45.067 --> 24:45.907
it's...

24:45.943 --> 24:47.413
Harvest friends.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.487
Yeah.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.654
- So we're just
harvest friends then?

24:49.655 --> 24:52.241
Ah, not yet.

24:52.408 --> 24:52.824
Ow!

24:52.825 --> 24:54.451
Oh, god.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.744
Oh, it hurts to even punch
you, the backs of my arms

24:56.745 --> 24:57.954
are so sore.

24:57.955 --> 24:58.997
- Yeah, I'll bet
you didn't even know

24:58.998 --> 25:00.498
you had muscles
back there, did you?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.834
No.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.710
I've never worked
so hard in my life.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.504
- Well, it doesn't
really get any easier.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.088
Oh, yeah?

25:07.089 --> 25:08.131
- Uh
- hein.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.551
That's great, thanks.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.594
So why are you doing it?

25:12.595 --> 25:13.762
Ah.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.722
I'm saving up for next year.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.431
- Mm
- hmm?

25:16.432 --> 25:17.725
For college.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.892
You?

25:19.059 --> 25:21.312
Car.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.647
- You've been working like
this all year for a car?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.275
Two years.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.694
- Oh my gosh, I definitely
couldn't do that.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.785
- Ah, you haven't
seen the car.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.175
I'm getting real close.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.635
I should have enough
with the harvest here.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.138
I ain't going nowhere.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.889
- You'll let me know
if you get an offer?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.490
I said I would.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.608
- You're getting
real close.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.734
Yeah, I know.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.653
Maybe a couple more
checks, you know?

26:53.654 --> 26:54.254
Yeah.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.185
That's fuckin' kicked.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.983
Look at that!

27:31.150 --> 27:32.901
Eh?

27:33.068 --> 27:34.026
Let's go.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.864
I want to break some shit.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.407
Yeah.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.284
All right.

27:40.451 --> 27:41.909
That's what's up with that.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.070
Keep going, keep going.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.710
All right, come on!

27:46.790 --> 27:47.790
It's there.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.376
Just fuck it!

27:49.543 --> 27:50.627
Whoa!

27:55.007 --> 27:56.467
Holy shit!

27:56.633 --> 27:58.718
- Let's go shoot it with
some fuckin' potatoes, yeah?

27:58.719 --> 27:59.428
Yeah.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.194
All right.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.894
See if it's strong enough.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.063
<i>N" gm!</i>

29:20.217 --> 29:22.344
It's all bullshit.

29:22.511 --> 29:26.097
You know, by third grade
they've fuckin' decided,

29:26.098 --> 29:28.891
bang, who's
staying, who's going.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.768
They're either going
to care about you,

29:30.769 --> 29:35.189
or they're not going to
give a fuck about you.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.108
They're always calling me
into the fuckin' guidance

29:37.109 --> 29:40.487
counselor's office.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.990
And it is bullshit.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.950
They're wrong.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.659
But then again,
none of it's going

29:46.660 --> 29:50.480
to matter anyway, so
fuck 'em, you know?

30:07.598 --> 30:11.728
- I knew you were going
to fuckin' do that.

31:39.439 --> 31:43.401
- This works out, we can make a fuck
- ton of money, me and you.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.612
- What about this
thing with the Keegans?

31:46.613 --> 31:48.906
You know, where you've got
45 Hell's Angels just up

31:48.907 --> 31:51.242
the road there at Bear Lake?

31:51.243 --> 31:53.285
- Hell's Angels want to do
battle with the Keegans, who

31:53.286 --> 31:56.122
are running meth
and coke south up.

31:56.123 --> 32:00.126
Meth's between the Angels
and Phil and Bobby Keegan.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.169
Keegans being
green-lit got shit-all

32:02.170 --> 32:03.671
to do with us, as
far as I'm concerned.

32:03.672 --> 32:08.010
'IS that
- nus n me or "us n,

32:08.176 --> 32:10.177
like you and your guys?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.304
Both.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.281
Both is fair game.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.600
It stands right now, that
includes the gatekeepers.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.270
As long as we stick to
running pot and pills,

32:19.271 --> 32:22.231
Hell's Angels got no
business knowing our business.

32:22.232 --> 32:27.279
This works out with
the FlÃ³rida guy,

32:27.446 --> 32:32.242
we're slamming pills all
down the I-95 corridor.

32:32.409 --> 32:36.329
It starts right now,
right here, with us.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.397
Don't fuck this
up, all right?

32:48.925 --> 32:50.905
Let's load them up.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.364
Hello, sir.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.282
How are you today?

33:13.283 --> 33:14.116
I'm good, thank you.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.159
How are you?

33:15.160 --> 33:16.450
Not too bad.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.703
What is your citizenship?

33:17.704 --> 33:19.374
I'm an American.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.599
- Hold on just
a minute, please.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.733
What was the purpose of
your trip to CanadÃ¡ today?

33:47.734 --> 33:49.944
- Uh, got a pizza at the
Little House of Pizza.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.654
- You purchase anything
else besides the pizza?

33:51.655 --> 33:52.739
No, sir.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.115
- Is there anything
else in the truck

33:54.116 --> 33:55.407
that doesn't belong to you?

33:55.408 --> 33:56.492
No, sir, it's all mine.

33:56.493 --> 33:57.660
- All right, thank
you very much.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.494
Have a good day.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.545
Thank you.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.997
Did this guy do
something wrong?

34:01.998 --> 34:06.778
- Oh, I don't know, but
we're about to find out.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.984
<i>- What about, uh...
uh, Jesse's brother?</i>

34:21.101 --> 34:21.725
What's his name?

34:21.726 --> 34:22.396
Ethan.

34:24.980 --> 34:25.580
Yeah.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.529
You know.

34:33.530 --> 34:34.531
Ahem.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.489
He said he would, uh, pay
- pay me

34:36.491 --> 34:39.411
when he got his
welfare check.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.956
He'd get the rest to me,
uh, the first of the month.

34:43.956 --> 34:44.417
OK.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.545
Your job is to keep
them between the ditches.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.672
They go off the road, they
start to fall behind...

34:52.674 --> 34:54.007
- All right,
I'll talk to him.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.259
- I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.262
Yeah, yeah.

34:57.429 --> 35:03.351
OK, well... my brother.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.269
<i>Yaw.!</i>

35:04.436 --> 35:07.313
Where's my fucking money?

35:07.314 --> 35:08.856
Give me my fucking money!

35:08.857 --> 35:10.774
Where's my fucking money?

35:10.775 --> 35:12.695
All right, seriously.

35:12.777 --> 35:13.527
I'm serious.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.696
He's my little brother!

35:15.697 --> 35:16.907
Whoa!

35:17.073 --> 35:19.617
Wait, too
- that went on way too fucking long.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.743
- I'm only
kidding you, man.

35:20.744 --> 35:21.493
Oh, are you?

35:21.494 --> 35:22.754
Jesus Christ!

35:27.751 --> 35:29.877
- Yeah, I've been working
on some slight modifications.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.630
Oh yeah?

35:31.796 --> 35:34.381
- Added this big
- ass fuel tank back here.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.362
Climb up.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.713
I think you're
going to dig this.

35:39.012 --> 35:39.762
Get closer.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.573
Take a good whiff.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.978
Yeah, gas.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.606
Diesel.

35:49.773 --> 35:55.654
But over here
we'll add 3/4-inch.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.446
You see that pump?

35:57.447 --> 35:58.322
- Uh
- hein.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.448
Give me the hose.

35:59.449 --> 35:59.909
OK.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.568
<i>I'll plug it in.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:30.647
Kill it!

36:38.071 --> 36:39.239
Oh, shit!

36:47.872 --> 36:50.667
Yeah, three of them.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.754
Tighter than a
midget's pussy.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.805
No more "frozen river in the
middle of the night" bullshit.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.683
Now we drive it across
in broad daylight.

37:07.684 --> 37:13.565
The pipeline to CanadÃ¡'s
south runs through us.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.734
And with what we got
coming up from FlÃ³rida,

37:16.735 --> 37:20.725
we'll be working I-95
in both directions.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.482
Wait.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.083
Wait!

37:57.233 --> 37:59.486
What?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.446
Wait.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.156
I want to tell
you something.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.991
Did I do something?

38:05.992 --> 38:08.411
No.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.178
What?

38:13.875 --> 38:14.405
Stop

38:19.422 --> 38:21.612
I want you to know...

38:24.719 --> 38:25.319
What?

38:32.852 --> 38:37.065
- That I can
take care of you.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.651
I can take care of you and
that fuckin' baby inside you.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.071
My baby inside you.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.072
And I promise I will.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.117
I promise.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.659
I promise I'm not
going to fuck this up.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.788
I swear to god I'm not
going to fuck this up.

38:52.789 --> 38:56.500
I'm going to take care of
- of both of you.

38:56.501 --> 38:56.961
OK?

39:10.932 --> 39:12.602
Want to fuck me?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.238
- Well, you fuck up this
time of year, you're dead.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.490
- And half their
pitching staff is injured.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.200
Right.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.034
And the other
half just sucks.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.870
I mean, even if they make
the playoffs, who cares?

39:32.871 --> 39:33.829
Hey, guys?

39:33.830 --> 39:34.706
Yeah?

39:34.873 --> 39:38.173
- I could use some
help over here.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.044
Yeah.

39:40.211 --> 39:44.061
Let me try to lift
the roller up there.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.594
So.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.722
So, uh, do you like the Sox?

39:50.889 --> 39:54.989
- I mean, I like some
players, like Pedroia.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.352
Not rooting against them
there, but not building my plans

39:57.353 --> 39:58.979
and dreams around
them either.

39:58.980 --> 39:59.980
Whoa, man.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.901
She's shitting
on your dreams.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.005
Are you OK?

40:24.172 --> 40:25.464
Yeah, Emma, I'm fine.

40:25.465 --> 40:26.341
Why?

40:26.508 --> 40:28.008
- You know, I was
just joking before.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.177
You know, you said you were
moving to Boston with Casper

40:30.178 --> 40:32.179
to go to Red Sox
games, so I was just

40:32.180 --> 40:33.805
trying to be funny about it.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.016
- You know, I
- I get it.

40:36.017 --> 40:39.603
I get that you don't get it, and that's
- that's OK.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.022
- Look, I didn't mean to be
mean about your friend there.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.398
I just
- I don't know.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.983
I just always hear
about all the trouble

40:44.984 --> 40:46.235
he gets in all the time.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.153
Like he got Tasha
Nadeau pregnant,

40:48.154 --> 40:49.279
and she's like 15 years old.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.155
I just don't...

40:50.156 --> 40:50.906
- You sound like
everyone else.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.241
They don't get it.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.951
It's like when
- say you're out drowning

40:53.952 --> 40:55.953
on Long Lake and someone
throws you a life vest.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.247
That's... that's Casper.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.748
- He's there to
throw you a life vest?

40:59.749 --> 41:00.583
No.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.876
No, Casper is the life vest.

41:02.877 --> 41:03.878
OK?

41:04.045 --> 41:05.837
You know, he's
always been there.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.756
I know exactly what
I'm getting with him.

41:07.757 --> 41:11.093
And then when I'm around him,
I don't feel like I'm drowning.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.886
When I hang out
with Casper, I know

41:12.887 --> 41:14.471
something crazy
is going to happen.

41:14.472 --> 41:18.332
But you know, at least
something happened.

41:22.855 --> 41:27.359
- You know, I don't know
very much about the Red Sox.

41:27.360 --> 41:31.572
But I do know that I'm
supposed to hate the Yankees.

41:31.573 --> 41:32.407
Yeah.

41:32.574 --> 41:35.834
I got to teach
you how to sweep.

41:36.286 --> 41:38.830
My god, this is terrible.

42:14.073 --> 42:17.303
- You think that's
going to work?

42:18.202 --> 42:19.454
Move.

42:19.621 --> 42:21.080
Fuckin' hammer.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.057
Here, this is how you do it.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.225
OK, it's on.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.643
It should pop up
as a new network.

42:42.644 --> 42:43.244
Yeah.

42:43.311 --> 42:43.911
Fuck.

42:43.936 --> 42:44.979
Yeah?

42:45.146 --> 42:45.771
- We got fucking Wi
- Fi in this shit.

42:45.772 --> 42:46.582
Awesome!

42:49.734 --> 42:53.820
- Relationship
- you guys are in a relationship now, hein?

42:53.821 --> 42:55.572
I guess she's like your
baby mama though, right?

42:55.573 --> 42:56.553
Fuck you.

42:56.616 --> 42:57.659
You know.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.118
Fuck it.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.703
- Why don't you just
click on her there?

43:01.704 --> 43:03.789
Oh, Emma Daigle there.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.123
Why would she be
friends with Tasha?

43:05.124 --> 43:06.416
Oh, girls don't

43:06.417 --> 43:08.335
have to like each other
to be friends on here.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.587
Girls don't have to like each
other to be fuckin' friends.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.464
And that's the
fuckin' truth there.

43:12.465 --> 43:13.674
Oh, here we go.

43:13.675 --> 43:16.760
Her favorite quote...
sometimes good things

43:16.761 --> 43:20.806
have to fall apart so that...
so that better things can

43:20.807 --> 43:21.932
fall together.

43:21.933 --> 43:22.913
Oh, yeah.

43:27.689 --> 43:29.272
- You guys are all
fuckin' geniuses.

43:29.273 --> 43:32.433
At least, that's
what you think.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.736
You all think you're
the first ones who

43:34.737 --> 43:36.363
ever thought of something.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.573
Like you're the
ones who invented

43:38.574 --> 43:41.394
bringing shit
across a border.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.707
Let me tell you something.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.542
We got you.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.461
You're done.

43:50.628 --> 43:54.424
Charged, but cooperating.

43:54.590 --> 43:58.510
You do understand, uh,
cooperating defendant part?

43:58.511 --> 44:00.041
That's on you.

44:03.182 --> 44:08.352
For a felony, you're looking
at starting at four years.

44:09.564 --> 44:10.439
So what?

44:10.440 --> 44:11.565
I do four years in jail.

44:11.566 --> 44:12.107
Who cares?

44:12.108 --> 44:14.318
Oh yeah, OK.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.029
Jail.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.782
Jail is not federal prison.

44:28.666 --> 44:32.376
You're not a smart
guy, are you, Lee?

44:32.837 --> 44:33.887
All right.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.380
Do you think you're smart?

44:35.381 --> 44:38.216
Or do you know deep down
inside that you are not smart?

44:38.217 --> 44:39.577
I hate Jesse.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.431
- Don't blame your
fuckin' cousin.

44:44.432 --> 44:45.974
- No one's fuckin'
solid no more.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.058
No, no, no, no.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.727
You're right about that.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.298
Drugs will do that to you.

44:52.982 --> 44:56.527
But Jesse, he's
a bright guy.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.738
He wanted to keep his
passport so he could cross over

44:59.739 --> 45:00.789
to CanadÃ¡.

45:00.948 --> 45:03.158
Said something about
hockey and strip clubs

45:03.159 --> 45:05.202
being important to him.

45:05.203 --> 45:10.166
So when we asked
him to wear a wire,

45:10.333 --> 45:13.627
that bright son of a
bitch took all of about one

45:13.628 --> 45:16.671
and a half, maybe two
seconds to think it over.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.256
Oh, he's a bright guy.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.884
He's in CanadÃ¡ right now
with a big old set of titties

45:20.885 --> 45:24.085
flapping in his
face, knowing him.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.688
Yeah.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.398
Then again, you've
got nothing to lose.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.069
Right?

45:39.779 --> 45:42.031
Phew.

45:42.198 --> 45:43.698
You want us to
tell the prosecutor

45:43.699 --> 45:45.929
you've been cooperative.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.246
You do realize
that you are going

45:49.247 --> 45:52.657
to actually need
to cooperate, right?

45:56.462 --> 45:57.132
Right?

46:15.898 --> 46:16.498
Fuck!

46:34.917 --> 46:39.589
I have children,
4 boys and 4 girls,

46:39.755 --> 46:43.965
and 12 grandchildren and
2 great-grandchildren.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.762
- Hey, did you remember
my cookie dough?

46:47.763 --> 46:49.306
I helped him move on

46:49.307 --> 46:52.058
after he served a
tour in the Korean War.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.979
That was hard
enough 'til I...

46:55.062 --> 46:55.662
Baby?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.697
Baby, what's wrong?

47:52.703 --> 47:56.499
Shit, that's so good.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.041
That is so good.

47:58.042 --> 48:01.837
Mmm, so awesome.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.425
Thank you.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.519
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

48:17.520 --> 48:20.314
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

48:20.481 --> 48:23.693
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

48:29.448 --> 48:31.409
I'm private, OK?

48:31.575 --> 48:34.077
I don't need your stupid
fuckin' friends, none of that.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.747
Do you even love me?

48:36.914 --> 48:39.416
- Tasha, why do we
- you always make it like this.

48:39.417 --> 48:42.210
Do I love you?

48:42.211 --> 48:44.462
- OK, my friends
- my friends are not stupid, OK?

48:44.463 --> 48:45.296
You're stupid.

48:45.297 --> 48:46.840
- That one's
fuckin' stupid.

48:46.841 --> 48:50.001
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

48:51.721 --> 48:53.888
What the fuck is
- come here.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.109
Look at me.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.356
Are you fuckin' drunk?

48:57.518 --> 48:59.019
Are you
- you're fuckin' drunk.

48:59.020 --> 48:59.562
No.

48:59.729 --> 49:00.103
Look at you.

49:00.104 --> 49:00.634
"No!

49:00.730 --> 49:01.438
Fuck me.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.815
No.

49:02.982 --> 49:03.648
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

49:03.649 --> 49:04.524
No, I'm not drunk!

49:04.525 --> 49:05.734
- Keep your
fuckin' voice down.

49:05.735 --> 49:06.484
I'm not drunk.

49:06.485 --> 49:07.527
Yes, you... stop it.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.928
Smell anything?

49:12.783 --> 49:14.159
I'm not drunk, OK?

49:14.160 --> 49:15.660
I'm not drunk.

49:15.661 --> 49:16.536
It's OK.

49:16.537 --> 49:17.871
- And you're...
you're an asshole.

49:17.872 --> 49:18.664
No.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.248
And you don't love me.

49:20.249 --> 49:22.500
And you don't
love your baby, OK?

49:22.501 --> 49:24.502
- Just keep your
fuckin' voice down.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.838
Just keep your
fuckin' voice down.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.423
Don't fuckin'...

49:28.424 --> 49:31.584
- I'm having
Casper Cote's baby!

49:34.305 --> 49:35.115
Asshole!

49:54.658 --> 49:56.659
- Hey, asshole, how'd
it go with Tasha?

49:56.660 --> 49:58.746
All right.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.122
Phew.

50:00.289 --> 50:02.582
You know what
they say there.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.501
Sometimes good
things have to fall

50:04.502 --> 50:08.755
apart so that better things
can fall together, you know?

50:08.756 --> 50:09.881
That's very funny there.

50:09.882 --> 50:11.424
It is pretty funny.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.051
- Now I know why you
have to date 15-year-olds.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.679
Oh.

50:15.846 --> 50:18.099
Oh, fuck me!

50:18.265 --> 50:18.891
Hey!

50:19.058 --> 50:20.351
Moose safari.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.392
You guys want to go?

50:21.393 --> 50:23.583
What's a moose safari?

50:23.687 --> 50:31.487
"What's a moose safari?"

50:38.786 --> 50:39.995
Oh my god!

50:40.162 --> 50:41.372
Oh my god!

50:41.539 --> 50:43.582
Oh my god!

50:43.749 --> 50:46.585
Oh my god!

51:04.270 --> 51:07.605
- Little pink flower,
what's your little name?

51:07.606 --> 51:11.706
Little pink flower,
what's your little name?

51:28.043 --> 51:30.295
That was so fucking fun!

51:30.296 --> 51:31.838
Don't tell me that
wasn't fucking fun.

51:31.839 --> 51:33.673
- I told you it
was fucking fun.

51:33.674 --> 51:34.934
- Woo
- hoo!

51:37.720 --> 51:38.928
We don't always get one.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.805
That was wicked cool.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.433
- Sometimes they get killed if
we, like, hit it, you know...

51:43.434 --> 51:44.309
Watch it, man.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.310
- Hey, man, you
bumped into me.

51:45.311 --> 51:46.394
What did you say to me?

51:46.395 --> 51:47.312
- L
- I don't want to start anything.

51:47.313 --> 51:48.188
What did you say?

51:48.189 --> 51:48.897
- I don't want
to start anything.

51:48.898 --> 51:49.856
I'm just...

51:49.857 --> 51:50.607
Who do you think you are?

51:50.608 --> 51:51.941
Don't touch me!

51:51.942 --> 51:54.320
'Casper?

51:54.486 --> 51:55.995
Hold this.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.322
Get out of my face.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.031
You don't want to
get out of my face?

51:58.032 --> 51:58.865
Don't shove me, man.

51:58.866 --> 51:59.658
Casper.

51:59.825 --> 52:00.868
Casper!

52:01.035 --> 52:01.785
Casper!

52:01.952 --> 52:03.077
Casper, you win, buddy.

52:03.078 --> 52:03.953
Come on.

52:03.954 --> 52:04.871
Come on, buddy, it's OK.

52:04.872 --> 52:06.039
Get the fuck off me.

52:06.040 --> 52:06.581
Hey, hey, hey!

52:06.582 --> 52:07.416
Hey!

52:07.583 --> 52:08.493
Come on.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.759
- You fuckin' put
your hands on him,

52:17.760 --> 52:19.052
you put your
fuckin' hands on me.

52:19.053 --> 52:21.555
You understand that there?

52:21.722 --> 52:23.765
You don't ever
fuckin' walk in here

52:23.766 --> 52:26.351
and put your
fuckin' hands on him!

52:26.352 --> 52:29.771
You go back to fuckin'
Madawaska where you fucking came.

52:29.772 --> 52:32.774
Crack, take your fucking
crack crew with you.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.944
What the fuck are
you looking at?

52:35.945 --> 52:38.614
I said, get fuckin' walking!

52:38.781 --> 52:39.948
What are you looking at?

52:39.949 --> 52:41.366
Get the fuck out of here!

52:41.367 --> 52:42.417
Yeah, you!

52:48.290 --> 52:50.375
Your buddies are
going there, kiddo.

52:50.376 --> 52:52.586
Casper, come on, man.

52:52.753 --> 52:53.493
Casper.

52:58.801 --> 53:04.081
- You come around here, you
ask about Casper fuckin' Cote.

53:06.058 --> 53:08.978
I run the fuckin'
county, kid.

53:10.312 --> 53:11.052
Well...

54:04.074 --> 54:06.284
- I am not feeling
sorry for you.

54:06.285 --> 54:07.660
You're going to be
late for harvest.

54:07.661 --> 54:08.786
What's George going to say?

54:08.787 --> 54:12.248
- Well, I don't even
start until later.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.833
You feel good right now?

54:13.834 --> 54:16.419
It's the same story every
time you hang out with him.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.463
- God, it's not...
it's not Casper.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.298
"No?

54:19.465 --> 54:20.715
Oh, so is it you?

54:20.716 --> 54:22.175
Yeah, I don't think so.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.968
Trouble does not fall
far from the tree.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.678
You're so much
better than him.

54:25.679 --> 54:26.888
I'm... I'm not.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.306
OK, we're
- we're no different.

54:28.307 --> 54:29.849
All you want to
talk about is just

54:29.850 --> 54:31.976
me going and working for
George the rest of my life.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.102
- Yeah, because it's
a good opportunity,

54:33.103 --> 54:34.812
and it's there
if you want it.

54:34.813 --> 54:38.143
- It's fuckin'
here if I want it.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.070
No, I can't.

54:42.071 --> 54:44.655
I'm telling
you, no, I can't.

54:44.656 --> 54:47.658
Uh, I'm- I'm fuckin'- I'm...
I'm shittin' my- my guts out

54:47.659 --> 54:51.497
my ass here, OK?

54:51.663 --> 54:54.457
Uh, yeah, I've got food
poisoned or something.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.251
I don't know, but I'm...
it's coming out of both ends,

54:57.252 --> 54:58.628
and
- and I can't... I can't make it.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.463
Five
- five minutes.

55:00.464 --> 55:08.263
I'II- I'II- I'II- I'II,
uh- no, I- I'm telling you,

55:08.430 --> 55:10.306
I can't fucking
do it, all right?

55:10.307 --> 55:14.367
You're going to have
to get somebody else.

55:15.104 --> 55:16.254
I'm sorry.

55:18.273 --> 55:18.733
OK.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.179
4463/...

55:49.346 --> 55:50.514
Wake up.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.392
Get up.

55:53.559 --> 55:54.779
I need you.

56:26.467 --> 56:27.800
Hey there, you!

56:27.801 --> 56:29.178
Hey!

56:29.344 --> 56:30.553
How you been?

56:30.554 --> 56:31.095
Hey, Casper.

56:31.096 --> 56:32.388
How you doing?

56:32.389 --> 56:33.389
Casper the Ghost, hein?

56:33.390 --> 56:34.016
Yeah.

56:34.183 --> 56:34.932
That's my friend Dom here.

56:34.933 --> 56:35.476
Hi.

56:35.642 --> 56:36.267
Look at him.

56:36.268 --> 56:36.934
What's his name?

56:36.935 --> 56:37.643
Dominic.

56:37.644 --> 56:38.478
Oh, Dominic.

56:38.479 --> 56:39.353
Yeah.

56:39.354 --> 56:39.687
Oh.

56:39.688 --> 56:40.523
Hi.

56:40.564 --> 56:41.106
Hi

56:41.273 --> 56:41.772
You got a French name.

56:41.773 --> 56:43.108
Yeah.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.817
- If you want those, I got
those that you can have.

56:44.818 --> 56:45.985
Yeah, my uncle
couldn't come this week.

56:45.986 --> 56:47.154
Yeah.

56:47.321 --> 56:47.862
- Yeah, so you can
pick them up for him.

56:47.863 --> 56:48.463
Yeah.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.622
Yeah, there.

56:56.788 --> 56:57.705
You like them?

56:57.706 --> 56:58.080
They suit you.

56:58.081 --> 56:58.539
Yeah.

56:58.540 --> 56:59.208
Hmm.

56:59.374 --> 57:00.416
- Here, Dom,
these are yours.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.542
- They're more
Frenchy than yours.

57:01.543 --> 57:02.211
Yeah?

57:02.377 --> 57:05.339
Here, you wear mine.

57:05.506 --> 57:06.589
I like yours too, though.

57:06.590 --> 57:07.799
Yeah.

57:07.966 --> 57:10.092
- You're ready
for an ATV, you.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.135
Vroom, vroom!

57:11.136 --> 57:12.678
- Well, you guys
have to leave?

57:12.679 --> 57:15.097
- Uh, I mean, is there anything
else we can do for you, or?

57:15.098 --> 57:16.350
Yeah.

57:16.517 --> 57:18.518
When you have time, you
can do the bird feeder

57:18.519 --> 57:20.603
because it's too
far out of my reach.

57:20.604 --> 57:21.204
Yeah.

57:21.355 --> 57:22.522
You can fill it up.

57:22.523 --> 57:24.023
Yeah, happy to help.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.108
- And then when you have more
time, you can do some wood.

57:26.109 --> 57:27.610
- "Anything else
we can do for you?"

57:27.611 --> 57:28.487
Really?

57:28.654 --> 57:29.946
- You know, I
felt sorry for her.

57:29.947 --> 57:30.613
I mean, she's old.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.156
She's a sweet lady.

57:32.157 --> 57:35.076
- She makes $3,600 a month on
pills she pays $4 a bottle for,

57:35.077 --> 57:36.118
all right?

57:36.119 --> 57:38.579
She should feel
sorry for us.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.800
Pour it in.

57:44.378 --> 57:44.877
Yeah.

57:44.878 --> 57:45.920
We're good?

57:45.921 --> 57:47.756
Yeah.

57:47.923 --> 57:49.382
Look at these fat birds.

57:49.383 --> 57:52.761
You see those holes there?

57:52.928 --> 57:54.929
She shoots the
raccoons from inside.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.640
She'll just sit there, bang!

57:59.935 --> 58:01.353
Here you go.

58:01.520 --> 58:06.233
And, uh, thank you for
your service, you know?

58:22.040 --> 58:23.165
You want some?

58:23.166 --> 58:26.461
- No, I'm, uh
- I'm good.

58:26.628 --> 58:27.879
You?

58:28.046 --> 58:31.674
- No, no, I'm, uh...
I'm good too, thank you.

58:31.675 --> 58:37.723
- Uh, Sr. Borgia, we're...
we're here for, um, you know...

58:37.889 --> 58:39.599
my uncle couldn't,
but, uh...

58:39.600 --> 58:42.727
- Right now the cheapest thing
you can eat is peanut butter,

58:42.728 --> 58:47.608
but put it on a cracker
with a banana pepper,

58:47.774 --> 58:48.774
it ain't half bad.

58:48.775 --> 58:49.900
Sounds good, yeah.

58:49.901 --> 58:51.278
Arthur!

58:51.445 --> 58:53.279
Just give him the damn pills
already and come back to bed.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.947
Do you have to talk
everybody's ear off?

58:54.948 --> 58:56.282
- Do you have to
come out and chum up

58:56.283 --> 58:57.658
to every guy who
comes in here?

58:57.659 --> 58:59.118
Bring the crackers.

58:59.119 --> 59:00.409
Come to bed.

59:11.882 --> 59:15.212
- Let's get the
fuck out of here.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.618
All right!

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.911
Whee!

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.526
Now, you did good.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.447
You did real good.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:43.157
Now, you want this
to be something more

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.533
than just an
after-school special?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.786
You want this to grow
into something bigger?

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:50.039
Then you need to
know the business, OK?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.208
OK.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:55.754
- Now, Badger, he
learned the business,

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:58.297
but he don't know business.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:01:59.131
You understand?

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.634
Mm-hmm.

01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.469
- I mean, he got
no mind for it.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:10.811
But you, with you we
might have something.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.104
Who are we?

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.105
You know, who are
we in all of this?

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:18.693
We're... well, we're...

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.050
Little fish.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:20.711
Yeah?

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.364
Yeah.

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:27.326
- Yeah, we're little fish in
the big pond, gasping for air.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:31.580
But the doctors that write those
scripts and the pharmacies that

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.583
fill those scripts and the
companies that distribute all

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:39.234
them big bad drugs...
well, they're the big fish.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.089
You know?

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.632
They're like Moby Dick.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:42.299
Remember?

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:42.675
Yeah.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:43.510
Yeah?

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:44.553
Yeah.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.138
- Moby Dick in a
fucking kiddie pool.

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:51.267
- The bottom line
of the whole deal,

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:55.808
we are just a spoke in
a very fucked-up wheel.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.777
It's funny, you know?

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.529
Almost everyone I know right
now is working the potato harvest

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.196
there.

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:46.739
Yeah.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.284
And I'm here.

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:55.071
I would much rather be here
than work in the potato harvest.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.186
- So did George
tell you you're going

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:21.274
to be working
with Josh tomorrow?

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.942
What do you mean?

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:24.610
- Well, my parents are
taking me to Vermont

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.081
to look at colleges there.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.951
That's great.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:34.247
- Yeah, it should
be pretty cool.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.749
What?

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:43.846
- Then you're not going to back
with the harvester for a while.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.955
Ow.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.832
Twig or something.

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:20.168
Ow.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.453
Be careful.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.090
I want to get a place,
like a place for us.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:32.387
Like
- like for us and the baby.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:36.824
Before the baby comes,
we should get a place.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.476
What?

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:41.312
Don't you think?

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.355
<i>Uh...</i>

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.523
- Don't you want
to live with me?

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:45.567
Yeah.

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:48.944
And I'm going to pay
for that, though, right?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.114
That's what you're saying.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.925
Are you going to pay for it?

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.536
- I'm just saying I
want to get a place.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:58.913
OK.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.207
And I'm just asking you, who's
going to pay for that there?

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.459
- Well, do you
want people to think

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.545
that you can't
take care of me?

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:07.976
Your own baby?

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.594
Excuse me?

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:14.470
- I thought you said you
were going to take care of us.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.764
Oh, don't fucking start.

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:18.223
Don't get
- stop.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.558
Don't fuckin' start.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.129
Don't... Tasha!

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.647
Just
- just shut up, please.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.733
Just stop.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.068
Just shut the fuck
up, please, Tasha.

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.069
Don't tell me to shut up.

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:30.880
Tasha...

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.863
Don't tell me to shut up.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.394
OK, I'm sorry.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.700
Just stop talking, please.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.993
Everyone's going

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.245
to think you're
a stupid jerk.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.414
Oh, really? Everyone's
going to think

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.457
I'm a stupid jerk?

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.042
Is that what they're
going to think?

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.335
On the fuckin'
playground, they're

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:49.338
going to think that I'm
a stupid fucking jerk?

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.006
On my best fucking
day, they're going

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.341
to think I'm a
stupid fucking jerk.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.884
That's the truth there.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:58.215
I don't give a fuck
what any of them think.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:12.633
Oh, fuck.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.530
Oh, fuck.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.850
- What are you
thinking about?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.997
What?

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.292
Casper.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.627
- Oh my gosh, why are
you thinking about Casper

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.669
right now?

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.087
Oh, not exactly.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:58.091
It's- here, let me- let
me show you some pictures

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.801
of my car.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.386
Oh, the car.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:03.640
The car.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.515
Check that out.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.810
Oh, uau.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.520
That's wicked cool.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.648
You know, I was thinking
about the other night,

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.249
and I think I get it now.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:19.560
You know, he's
- he's really not half bad.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:21.381
Here.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:30.624
- I always thought
if I could just

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:35.170
earn enough to get this
car, then we could just go,

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.296
and everything
would be better.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:40.009
You know?

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.760
Like everything
we've been doing up

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:46.390
to now has been to
get to this one night.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:49.519
I'm so close.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:56.776
Casper just
- I just thought leaving would be easier.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.084
Sorry.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.209
Oh, yeah.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.740
Yeah, it's OK.

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:05.386
Let's have sex.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.638
What?

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.182
- Yeah, we want
to fuck, right?

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.602
Let's fuck.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.770
- I don't want
to right now.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.606
Why not?

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.773
I feel gross.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:18.684
Oh yeah?

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:22.086
What?

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.359
Take off your pants.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:32.914
What?

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:35.500
Take off your pants.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.334
What?

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.959
What's your problem?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.586
- Either you take off your
fuckin' pants right fuckin'

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.338
now, or I'm going to
take them off for you.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.172
You hear me there?

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:43.715
Take off your fuckin' pants.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.092
Take off your fuckin' pants!

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.093
Casper, stop it!

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:48.053
- Let's get the
fucking pants off!

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:48.724
"Stop!

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:56.591
- You're on your
period, Tasha.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.381
You're on your period.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:04.962
<i>Uh...</i>

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:05.822
Fuck!

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.074
Yeah, you fucking are!

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.284
I see it right
fucking there!

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.995
What the fuck!

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.122
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:16.081
Let me explain!

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:16.873
Go ahead.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.083
Explain it to me.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.502
What?

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.836
- I don't want
you to leave.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:21.962
Oh, fuck you!

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.964
Then you don't fucking lie!

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.882
You're a fucking liar!

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.177
Fuck you!

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:28.944
Fuck!

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.637
God fucking damn it!

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.974
"Stop!

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:34.099
Don't go.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.010
Shut up.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:42.124
Fuck.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.117
OK, now.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.075
You see how it
gets hot like that?

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:34.676
Yeah.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:35.160
Goes red?

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.120
Yeah.

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.329
- That's when you
add the filler metal.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:37.790
OK.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.430
'See?

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:39.122
And it melts it.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.499
It's like water.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.751
Oh.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.126
- You see how I kind of
fucked up right there?

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.712
Yeah.

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:50.008
- All I got to do is just heat
it up and move it with the heat

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.968
'til it's right and smooth.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.553
- And then you
just fix it, yeah?

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:57.057
- You just fix it, and nobody
will know the difference.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.391
Now, pay attention.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.601
I'm paying attention!

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.102
- All right, well,
you're doing the next one.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.395
This is fuckin' dangerous.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:02.771
This is...

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:03.612
I know.

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:04.689
Don't hit me.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.315
4463/...

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:06.025
Hey.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:09.779
OK, so I bring
it over Tuesday.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.363
First thing Wednesday
morning, you're

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.572
going to go over
to Portsmouth...

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:13.824
OK.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.909
- With that and what I
already brought across.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.161
Now, he's not going to show
up 'til later in the day,

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.539
so you're going to meet
up right at the motel.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.390
And I want you to
take Casper with you.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.419
What?

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.046
Oh.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:30.133
You know, I... I fuckin'
- no.

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:31.132
I can't.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:31.733
What?

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:32.467
You can't what?

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.677
I mean, whatever.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.845
I'II
- I'll drive it down, but not with him.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.430
- What are you
talking about?

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:39.808
- I'm telling you, I
want him to go with you.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:40.977
You know?

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.227
He needs to know the
route, same as you.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.312
- Well then, fuckin'
forget it, OK?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.023
I mean... uh.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.691
You know, I don't
need him looking over

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.817
my fuckin' shoulder.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.193
- I'm not looking
over your shoulder.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.194
Is that what you think?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.530
No.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:57.937
I think this is about you
and your fucking trust issues.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:01.664
Badger!

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:02.623
Badger!

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.083
Come back!

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.500
What the fuck?

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.169
Yeah.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.170
No, he'll be back.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.505
"Trust issues."

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.173
Yeah.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.382
- He used to
be a lot worse.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:12.983
Yeah.

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.970
And your trust issues.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:16.737
Yeah.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.459
- Yeah, it's definitely
my first choice.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.127
Uh, the campus
is really awesome.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.047
They have this, like, big
lake out there and, you know,

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.507
like this giant
outdoor mall.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.800
It was really cool.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.218
It sounds really cool.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.846
- Yeah, it was really
a good trip, you know?

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.931
I'm really excited
for next year.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:05.018
- I had to work with creepy old
Josh the whole time, you know?

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.759
And I missed you.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.741
Yeah, I missed you too.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:16.118
So is something wrong?

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.993
- I just feel like I'm
- I'm really starting to like you,

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:26.790
you know, Dom, and I
- I just don't want to give you

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:30.752
the wrong ideia, uh, and make
you think that this can be more

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:31.461
than it is.

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:34.840
Because I don't know.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:37.175
L
- I just think this kind of has to be a harvest thing,

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:37.967
you know?

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.844
Like
- like what you said.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.597
It's like
- like harvest friends.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:44.767
Harvest friends, right.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.226
Like you and Austin.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:46.897
Right.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.369
4463/...

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:06.038
Got your passport, kiddo?

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.456
Yeah.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.503
I need you tonight.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:36.527
What?

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:37.604
Oh, her?

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.237
She's cute, hein?

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.196
That's a fucking beast.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:43.200
That ain't no car, kiddo.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.937
I've seen your script run.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.538
Puts you over the
top for your car.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.689
That's it?

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:50.790
Yeah, put that away.

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.792
I suppose our share is OK.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:53.793
No big deal.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.814
No big fuckin' thing.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:01.551
Turns out I don't need
diaper money anymore, so.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.386
What?

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:04.471
Don't worry about it.

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.097
You got your passport, you?

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:06.974
Why?

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.058
- We're going
to a hockey game.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.009
Seriously?

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.527
But why are you going again?

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.112
Because I've got
to fuckin' talk

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.489
to the guy about
some bullshit.

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:23.490
Don't worry about it.

01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:24.365
You have to talk

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.408
to a guy about
some bullshit?

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:26.659
Look, I don't

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.161
want to fuckin' talk
to you about this

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:29.162
all night, all right?

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.243
I'm late.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.501
Oh, yeah.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:36.712
Oh, yeah.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.256
Thank you.

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.800
This thing's a
fuckin' beast, no?

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:42.781
Oh, yeah.

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:43.802
It's a piece of shit.

01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:45.543
- It's a
- yeah.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.894
- He's going to the
Draveurs game, you know.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.229
Play in Grand Falls area.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.230
Ah, I hate Grand Falls.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.106
- I know you
hate Grand Falls.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.917
That's why I took you there.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:05.132
There he is there.

01:19:11.539 --> 01:19:12.999
I don't know.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.749
Maybe he's doing his own thing
or something, his own deals

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.418
or something
on the side, so.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.671
My dad's pissed, you know.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:20.922
It's fucked up.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:26.679
- So, uh
- I slept with Emma.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:31.808
Shut your fuckin' face.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.227
Oh, yeah.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:34.727
- I fuckin'
called that there.

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:35.638
You did.

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:36.855
You called it.

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:38.076
How was it?

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:41.025
Good.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:41.626
What?

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:42.443
It was good.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.195
There's more to this.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:49.409
There's more to that "good" than just wha
- was she a virgin?

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.870
I don't know.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.459
- Kind of uncomfortable,
and we were

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.879
in a forest with
leaves and shit.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.921
No, you fuckin' weren't.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.131
You were in a forest?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:03.883
Yeah.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.386
OK.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:12.223
- Anyway, she said that we're
just harvest friends now, so.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:14.476
What?

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.894
What the fuck is that?

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:17.061
What's a harvest friend?

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.689
- I guess I just
wasn't part of her plan.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.740
And that's that, so.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.614
That's you being
responsible?

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:28.525
Just go!

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.637
Fuck you!

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:32.077
Oh, there he is.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.370
Down the stairs, dah-dah,
dah-dah, dah-dun-dun.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.873
Let's go.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.084
- You
- you shut the fuck up!

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:42.420
You're the one making all
the fuckin' noise out here.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:45.006
OK, let's go to a
fuckin' hockey game.

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:46.087
Let's go.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.489
He's not even going in.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.365
I don't know.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:37.368
I don't know
what he's doing.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.454
He says he's going
to the Draveurs game,

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:43.833
and then he's, I don't
know, sitting out here.

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:44.877
Fuck.

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:47.295
Come on, Badger,
what are you doing?

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:52.592
- Maybe he just wants a lap
dance before the game, you know?

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:53.426
All right.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.477
Well, he's going in.

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.389
What the
- he's not going.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.309
Do you see that?

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:01.726
What is he doing?

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:02.852
He just got in that car.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.228
I
- I don't know.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:08.525
Why is he- what
is- god damn it.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.014
Can I have your phone?

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.212
Hey, it's Casper.

01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:30.643
My phone died.

01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:32.091
Yeah.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:33.508
He didn't go to the game.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.510
- Damn fuckin' right,
he didn't go to the game.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.972
He... he
- no, he's at Mon Copain.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:41.724
He just got into
some guy's car.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:42.767
I don't know.

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.435
Like, the guy
just pulled up.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.729
No, he's
- he was sitting here for a while.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:48.231
Then this other
guy pulls in.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:49.899
He gets up like
he's going to go in,

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.860
and then he gets in
this other guy's car.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:53.461
Yeah.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:54.212
Yeah.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.656
Oh, wait.

01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:58.463
Wait, he's getting out now.

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:03.162
I don't know.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:06.663
I don't know who
the other guy is.

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:08.919
OK.

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:10.629
OK.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:11.755
OK.

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:13.422
All right, he's driving off.

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.299
He's going.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.467
And he's gone.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.553
OK, OK.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:18.136
And we're going to lose him.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:18.511
Yeah.

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:19.888
OK, bye.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.430
He wants us to
follow this guy.

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:22.411
That guy?

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:23.600
Yeah.

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:28.517
- Let's hope he's going
to a fucking hockey game.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:46.222
So what now?

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.354
I don't know.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.850
Just sit here and watch.

01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:49.245
What the hell is
he doing in there?

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:52.926
- What the hell are
we doing out here?

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:58.296
It's fuckin' stupid,
just sitting in this car.

01:26:58.297 --> 01:26:59.922
I mean, is this...
you know, you just

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:02.008
want to run errands for
Clayton the rest of your life.

01:27:02.009 --> 01:27:04.677
That's what you want to do?

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:06.637
- Is that what you
think I'm doing here?

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:07.347
<i>I...</i>

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:08.848
- I want to be
here right now?

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.349
- I don't know
what you want, but I

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.185
thought we were going to a...
to a hockey game, you know?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.979
- Well, I'm sorry
about the hockey game.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.230
- I used to think we both
wanted the same thing,

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.523
but now we're sitting
in a car instead

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:18.607
of going to a hockey game.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.026
It makes no fuckin' sense.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:23.863
- You used to think we
both wanted the same thing?

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:28.617
You know, you think leaving
this town is everything, right?

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:30.745
We
- we leave the town, then we go into the Boston,

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:31.829
and then we
watch the Red Sox.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:32.872
That's the plan.

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.543
That's the plan!

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.876
Then what?

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:37.585
What happens when
the game ends?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:38.295
What?

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:39.880
You tell me!

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:41.213
Give me something to do.

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:42.548
I'll do it, all right?

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:46.052
I'll leave, but you have
no ideia what kind of money

01:27:46.053 --> 01:27:47.261
I could make right here.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.596
- See, but this is
what I'm telling you.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.264
See, you think you're
doing something different.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.516
OK, you think like your dad
sees something special in you,

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:53.851
you know, but you're not.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.728
You're doing exactly
what everyone in this town

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:57.813
has expected you to do
since the day you were born,

01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.074
you included.

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:00.609
OK?

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:03.277
I'm
- I'm the one who's always expected something more from

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:04.112
You.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:05.154
I'm the one who
believes you want

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:07.448
something better
for yourself.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:08.700
OK?

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.452
This town has nothing
that either of us want.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.162
OK?

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.413
We're meant to
leave together.

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:17.250
We're not meant to stay.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.957
Shit gets old fast, Casper.

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:23.193
And it's going
to get old fast.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.984
Oh, shit.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.027
Oh...

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:44.902
Oh, fuck.

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.071
Fuck!

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:46.838
Shit.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.924
You're good here.

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:36.568
Hey, where's Dom?

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:57.559
What the fuck?

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:58.776
Holy shit.

01:29:58.935 --> 01:29:59.810
Go, go, go, go.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:00.186
No, Wait.

01:30:00.187 --> 01:30:00.854
Wait.

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:01.896
I can't just fuckin' go, OK?

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:04.315
I can't just
drive the fuck off.

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:04.773
Car.

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:05.858
Get down!

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:06.459
Fuck!

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:07.998
Piece of shit.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.947
There's three of them.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:12.574
Fuck.

01:30:22.209 --> 01:30:25.295
- After this
third, we can go.

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:28.506
We'll go up quick and
get the fuck out of here.

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:31.092
Come on, let's go.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:31.859
Fuck!

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.765
Let's go.

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:44.807
Come on!

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:45.414
What?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.691
Fuck!

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.859
Straight to fuckin' voice
mail, so he's already

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.361
in fuckin' CanadÃ¡.

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:53.447
- My god, your uncle is
such a fucking douchebag.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.451
Come on, come on.

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:59.788
See, maybe like
- what

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.956
if I said he didn't have
anything to do with it,

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:03.457
and that it was all me?

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.834
And that
- that I planned all this,

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:09.445
and
- and that he didn't do anything?

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.260
OK.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.703
Enough already.

01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:23.269
He's my brother, OK?

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:26.523
He's my only brother.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.290
And I love him.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:35.240
And now I'm fucking him!

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:36.575
Yeah.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.202
Yep, that's true.

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:42.955
He is your brother,
and you are fucking him.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:48.211
We are firmly entrenched
into fuck-you territory.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:51.798
You going to
listen to me, Lee?

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:53.674
Your brother is fucked
in the here and now

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:57.015
because of his
choices, his actions.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:02.558
Only one of which is aggravated
trafficking of scheduled drugs

01:32:02.559 --> 01:32:08.019
across an international border
with his idiot fucking brother.

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:16.698
This crying stuff, all this remorse, you've got to
- this

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:18.240
has got to be
in the rear view.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:19.491
You've got to put
that behind you.

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:22.132
You've got to move forward.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:23.454
You've got to
think about Amanda.

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.955
You've got a baby coming.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:31.837
You've got to suck it up.

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:34.058
You've got to man up.

01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:38.886
You've got to pull
your shit together.

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:39.557
Right.

01:32:43.683 --> 01:32:47.533
- Here's how this
is going to play out.

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.155
Thank you.

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:56.968
- Suspect is leaving
the port of entry.

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.087
How you doing?

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:55.714
Good.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.089
How are you, sir?

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:57.756
Can I get your license,
registration, proof

01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:58.966
of insurance?

01:33:58.967 --> 01:33:59.842
Where are you coming
from today, sir?

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:00.963
Uh, CanadÃ¡.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:01.760
CanadÃ¡?

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:02.553
And you're heading to?

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:03.154
Home.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:06.336
I'm just going

01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:07.349
to check your license
and registration.

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.330
I'll be right back.

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:42.134
You guys all set?

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:44.136
- Just on a hunch, let me run
my canine around the vehicle.

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:45.471
- Yeah, that
would be great.

01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:46.472
Sir, I'm Deputy Miller

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:47.681
with the Sheriff's Office.

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:49.183
I'm going to run my
dog around your vehicle.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.434
Anything illegal in the vehicle
that I need to know about?

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:51.644
Nope.

01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:53.520
- If you'll exit the vehicle,
take 10 steps forward.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.689
Face away from the vehicle
for me while I do the search.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.065
- Hey, I've got
this pizza here.

01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:58.234
I See it.

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.001
You're all set.

01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:00.669
Jeez.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.975
- Oh, he smells
the fuckin' pizza.

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.727
Go back to your vehicle.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:35.062
Put your hands on the hood while
I search you and the vehicle.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:36.113
Walk back.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:38.982
Keep your hands
out of your pockets.

01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:40.609
Put them on the hood.

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:41.568
Spread your legs.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.569
Anything sharp on you?

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:45.420
Any knives or
needles at all?

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:12.806
Bed's clear.

01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:15.362
Nothing will fit in there.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.316
So, uh, I'm done?

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:22.083
We're done now?

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:39.227
How much does the MDEA

01:37:39.228 --> 01:37:41.063
know about what
they've been doing?

01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:42.606
I mean, how much do
they know about us,

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:45.234
what we did, you know?

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:49.447
OK, we've got to...
we've got to go.

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:50.447
We've got to go.

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:51.323
We've got to get our money.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:53.241
We've got to go right now.

01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:54.451
Casper, we've got
to go right now!

01:37:54.452 --> 01:37:54.826
Come on.

01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:55.427
Fuck!

01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:16.682
Grab the funds.

01:38:16.683 --> 01:38:18.183
Grab the money.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:47.714
"Dom?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.715
Dom!

01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:51.883
Dom, let's go.

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.720
Dom!

01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:55.796
Come on, let's go.

01:39:01.477 --> 01:39:03.312
Fuck!

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.273
Get the fuck out!

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.275
No!

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:09.652
Dom!

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:12.280
Dom!

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:23.541
"No!

01:39:57.867 --> 01:39:59.747
You all right, Dom?

01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:03.288
Coming for you!

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:10.951
Dom!

01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:19.001
Dom?

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.495
Here!

01:40:42.662 --> 01:40:44.162
Ugh, over here.

01:41:55.318 --> 01:41:58.570
- When I was about your age,
someone really close to me

01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:00.489
died.

01:42:00.656 --> 01:42:04.993
And, um, my mom picked me up
and drove me to the funeral.

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:08.206
And I couldn't
cry, you know?

01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:10.123
I thought there was
something wrong with me

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:13.419
because I couldn't cry.

01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:17.172
I knew I missed him,
but I couldn't cry.

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:21.053
And my mom said,
don't worry, it's OK.

01:42:23.721 --> 01:42:25.013
It's not a race.

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:26.056
There's no rush.

01:42:26.057 --> 01:42:28.557
It'll come when it comes.

01:42:30.686 --> 01:42:37.193
And, uh, when I got to the
funeral, this guy I barely knew

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.277
put his arms around
me, hugged me.

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:44.992
And he said, I
wish you long life.

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:46.660
And I lost it.

01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:49.872
L
- I fell to pieces.

01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:52.989
And I
- I wish you long life.

01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:55.975
