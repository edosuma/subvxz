00:02.211 --> 00:03.670
Previously on Gilmore Girls. 

00:03.754 --> 00:05.923
Independence Inn. Michel speaking.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.216
I fixed the peach sauce.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.760
- I wanna take a bath in that sauce.
- I will make more.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.179
Let Michel look at your French paper
before you go.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.264
- Excuse me.
- That'd be great.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.641
- What's going on?
- Open it.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.186
- I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
- You're going to Chilton! Sorry.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.729
I told Mom you're changing schools.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.648
- Was she thrilled?
- The party's on Friday.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.983
I got the invoice for your enrollment fee.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.860
You did it, babe. You got in.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.321
Wow, that is a lot of zeros
behind that five.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.824
- Hi, Mom.
- Lorelai. My goodness, this is a surprise.

00:33.242 --> 00:37.162
- So, you need money.
- It's not for me. It's for Rory.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.249
Since we are now
financially involved in your life...

00:40.332 --> 00:42.376
I want to be actively involved in your life.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.836
Ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.838
Mom, what are you doing here?

00:46.922 --> 00:50.050
I came to wish my granddaughter luck
on her first day of school.

00:50.133 --> 00:54.137
She is my daughter.
And I decide how we live, not you.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.015
I'm allowed to pay for it
but not set foot on the premises.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.184
- I just wanna get the rules straight.
- Oh, boy.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.941
- So this whole plaid skirt thing, my idea?
- My day sucked, too.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.697
- Dinner was lovely, Emily.
- Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.032
- Who's Mira?
- Our cook.

01:14.241 --> 01:18.161
- I thought the cook was Heidi.
- No, we let Heidi go months ago.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.790
She had a problem closing things.
The door, the refrigerator...

01:21.832 --> 01:23.542
The liquor bottle.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.254
- Then it was Trina, then Sophia.
- I liked Sophia.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.506
- You did not.
- I didn't?

01:29.589 --> 01:33.176
- She was the one who sang.
- That's right. Terrible woman.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.513
And after Sophia, we had Anton.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.516
That's right.
Anton was the one that I liked.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.520
I'm sorry. Dad, how do you mix up
Anton and Sophia?

01:44.271 --> 01:47.274
- What do you mean?
- One is a man and one is a woman.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.153
- And your point being...
- That one is a man and one is a woman.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.655
I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.115
I don't have time to keep up...

01:55.198 --> 01:58.452
with the multitudes of people
that your mother employs.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.164
But one is a man and one is a woman.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.003
- The dinner was so wonderful, Mira.
- It's Sarah.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.047
I'm sorry.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.885
Mom, her name is Sarah.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.554
I thought she said Mira.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.142
Grandma, these plates are really pretty.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.353
Thank you, Rory.
They were your great-grandmother's.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.523
- Lorelai I.
- I thought mom was the first.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.025
Not in the name.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.862
No, but in so many other things,
I was a regular trailblazer.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.572
Just finishing your thought, Mom.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.657
Lorelai I was my mother.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.826
She was
an extremely accomplished equestrian...

02:39.910 --> 02:41.703
a distinguished patron of the arts...

02:41.745 --> 02:44.998
and she was also world-famous
for her masquerade balls.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.750
She was quite a woman, my mother.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.252
Yes, she was.
Mira, come cut the cake, please.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.672
Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah
out here with you?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074

03:51.606 --> 03:55.610
So, Lorelai, how are things
at that charming little inn of yours?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.946
They're still charming and little.

03:57.988 --> 04:01.741
We're crossing our fingers it doesn't
assert itself and become rude and large.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.952
Mom's having a huge wedding there
this week.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.287
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.747
There's people coming
from all over the country.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.541
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.377
- Rory, how's Chilton?
- Okay, done with me now.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.462
I'm sorry, was there more to the story?

04:14.546 --> 04:18.298
- Rory has to pick a team sport to play.
- It's a requirement.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.636
"Physical fitness is as important
as intellectual fitness."

04:21.678 --> 04:25.682
- So says Plato, and so say I.
- What sport are you going to pick?

04:26.016 --> 04:28.768
I'm not sure.
I'm not really the athletic type.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.271
I told her she should go out
for the debating team.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.774
- That's not a sport.
- It is, the way the Gilmores play.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.611
- So, what are your choices?
- God, there are a thousand of them.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.657
Basketball, lacrosse,
swimming, track, golf.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.325
- Golf?
- Yeah.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.828
Your grandfather is a golf player.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.915
He plays every week at the club.
He could teach you to play like a pro.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.585
He could take you there on Sunday.
It's perfect.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.879
It's not something you can teach
in an afternoon.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.381
That's okay. Rory can pick something else.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.883
Why should she?

04:59.966 --> 05:03.303
She needs to learn a sport,
and Richard can teach her a sport.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.263
You can use your mother's old golf clubs.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.099
They're gathering dust
along with the rest of her potential.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.810
Okay. Mom, could I maybe
talk to you for a minute?

05:10.894 --> 05:14.022
- We're having dessert.
- I know, but I'd like to talk to you fast...

05:14.105 --> 05:16.065
before the sugar sets in
and makes me crazy.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.027
- You are the oddest person.
- Too easy.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.113
What is so important
that can't wait for cake?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.573
Keep moving.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.870
This is as far as I can go,
unless I bore my way through the wall.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.622
- Don't do this, Mom.
- Do what?

05:30.705 --> 05:34.042
- Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.
- I'm not forcing anybody.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.086
You're manipulating the situation,
giving no one a way out.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.671
That's force. Look it up.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.924
I'm trying to help your daughter
get an education.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.259
- Thanks, she'll find another sport.
- Why should she?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.762
She doesn't wanna go,
and Dad doesn't wanna take her.

05:45.804 --> 05:49.641
He doesn't know what he wants. He'd cut
his hair at the butcher's, if I let him.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.643
Just let it go, please.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.978
Well, isn't this interesting?

05:54.604 --> 05:57.106
- You're afraid.
- Of what?

05:57.815 --> 06:00.902
That Rory will enjoy the club
and have a good time without you.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.987
- That's crazy.
- I agree.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.365
- I'm not afraid.
- Then let her go.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.285
- She won't enjoy it, Mom.
- Why don't we just let Rory decide?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.746
Because she's the sweetest kid
in the whole world.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.999
She won't say she doesn't wanna go
to avoid hurting your feelings.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.253
I'm sure you could give her some coaching
to get her over that.

06:18.294 --> 06:22.090
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
Believe it or not, this is not about you.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.758
Of course it's about me.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.428
If Rory goes and has a good time
without you, then I win.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.766
Okay, Bob Barker. Rory knocks herself out
all week at Chilton.

06:31.849 --> 06:35.103
The weekends are the only time she has
to unwind and have fun.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.980
- With you.
- I'm there.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.274
So let me get this straight.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.776
There's no way
that Rory could possibly enjoy...

06:41.818 --> 06:43.361
a weekend day with her grandfather.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.405
You're just gonna twist it all around.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.075
You know your daughter so well that you
don't even have to ask her opinion.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.160
She'd be miserable, and you'd know it.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.664
I'm so setting myself up here.
But, yes, she would be miserable.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.418
- That sounds a little controlling to me.
- I walked right into that.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.504
Interesting, isn't it,
you being the one who's controlling?

07:01.587 --> 07:03.298
- I am not being...
- According to you...

07:03.339 --> 07:05.508
I was the only one in the family
with that gift.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.801
I never said that!

07:06.843 --> 07:10.471
I guess you and I are more alike
than you thought, aren't we?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.516
You win.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.227
Thank you.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.321
- Did you get blind-sided? I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.656
- I tried to stop it, I swear.
- I know.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.700
- Maybe it won't be that bad.
- Maybe it won't.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.618
- Maybe I'll like it.
- Maybe you will.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.496
- Maybe you could come with me.
- Is there a You're Crazy team?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.373
- 'Cause they'd make you captain.
- Please.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.126
I love you. I would take a bullet for you.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.254
But I'd rather stick a sharp thing in my ear
than go to the club.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.297
Fine.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.716
I'd rather slide down
a banister of razorblades...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.510
and land in a pool of alcohol
than go to the club with you.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.387
- I got it.
- Don't stop me, I'm on a roll.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.474
I'd rather eat my own hand
than go to the club with you.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.978
I'd rather surgically alter my face to look
like the mad rich lady with the lion head...

07:59.062 --> 08:00.229
than go to the club with you.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.149
Would you like me to drive
so you can continue your diatribe?

08:03.232 --> 08:06.903
Would you? Thanks. I'd rather cut off
my head and use it as a punch bowl...

08:06.986 --> 08:08.488
than go to the club with you.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.122
You'll walk down here, over the bridge...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.666
with the swans floating by
and the music playing.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.794
What are they doing
with those purple flowers?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.087
Just decorating the bridge.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.631
I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.049
And I wanted blue.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.301
So I thought violet
would be a nice compromise.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.346
- But we paid for pink flowers.
- And the blue flowers.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.058
You did not pay for anything.
I told her to decorate with violet flowers.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.561
It's nice of her to try to take
the heat for me, but it's unnecessary.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.940
If you don't like it, buy your own flowers.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.570
Yes. I thought so.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.199
Now, go away. My Advil is wearing off.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.582
- Their father spoiled them.
- They're just excited.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.251
They're spoiled.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.170
And they won't move away.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.343
- Now, disaster list. What if it rains?
- We'll put up tents.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.720
- What if it's too windy?
- We'll secure everything...

09:14.804 --> 09:16.681
and put extra hairspray
in everybody's hair.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.723
Too hot?

09:17.807 --> 09:20.101
Umbrellas and fans
that won't cause any damage...

09:20.142 --> 09:23.688
because of the things that have been
secured and hair that's been sprayed.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.898
- So I have nothing to worry about?
- No.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.485
- There must be something.
- Listen, I have everything under control.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.696
Go to your room
and have a fabulous bubble bath.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.155
I'll send up some wine...

09:33.239 --> 09:37.493
and a masseuse who bears a remarkable
resemblance to Antonio Banderas.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.788
- How remarkable?
- Get ready to applaud.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.417
This is my favorite place
in the whole world.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.768
Could you send Maury up to Room 12
in about 20 minutes? Thanks.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.980
- So, any problems?
- With the wedding or my life?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.816
One guess. And I'll give you a hint:
It's not your life.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.694
- Do you stage these events to torture me?
- Yes.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.323
- Job well done.
- Okay, let's start again. Any problems?

10:16.490 --> 10:19.160
Guests are checked in,
baskets are given out...

10:19.243 --> 10:23.414
and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds
have been delivered.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.791
- Okay, good. Did Rory call?
- No.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.962
She's golfing all day with my father,
and I'm half-expecting...

10:30.046 --> 10:34.008
this big, "Save me!" call to come in.
You don't care at all, do you?

10:34.091 --> 10:37.470
To me you are the teacher
in the Charlie Brown cartoon.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.805
Forget it. Have the grooms arrived?

10:39.889 --> 10:42.141
Their plane was due at 7:30.
They should be here.

10:42.224 --> 10:46.270
- Maybe they made a run for it.
- Somebody got stood up at prom.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.901
- Oh, dear.
- What?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.743
- Are those...
- No, it would be too...

11:00.826 --> 11:02.203
Schmoopies!

11:04.246 --> 11:05.456
...weird.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.750
You kept this from me on purpose.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.711
It's like a really snooty
Doublemint commercial.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.090
Just let me know
when the midgets and clowns arrive.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.800
No.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.637
You have to get them all settled in.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.514
- I'm not talking to them.
- Yes, you are.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.891
I'm not talking to them nicely.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.394
It's after 8:00. She should be here already.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.562
She'll be here.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.065
You're supposed to tee off
at your designated time.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.610
You pay good money to that place.
You'll tee off when you tee off.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.154
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.617
- What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
- Nothing. It's fine.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.620
- This whole thing is absurd.
- She's your granddaughter.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.331
She's a 16-year-old
who would rather be at the mall.

11:47.414 --> 11:50.167
Show her all around the club,
especially the rose garden.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.670
- I am not a guide.
- Make sure you take her to lunch...

11:52.753 --> 11:56.090
- and have her get dessert.
- No one said anything about lunch.

11:56.131 --> 11:58.259
I hope Lorelai's clubs
are still in good shape.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.302
Emily, you are not listening to me.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.430
I will teach her to golf,
as promised by you...

12:03.556 --> 12:05.307
but lunch is out of the question.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.311
You have to eat, so you'll eat together.
Do you have sunscreen?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.314
- She's here.
- 8:30.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.942
We must remember to buy her a watch.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.070
Richard, so help me God,
you will be sweet to this girl...

12:18.153 --> 12:20.030
and make this a memorable day for her.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.284
It's the first time we can
show our granddaughter off at the club.

12:23.367 --> 12:27.204
And it means a great deal
to my happiness and yours...

12:27.288 --> 12:29.164
that this day go well.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.916
Are we clear?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.672
- Rory, hello!
- Sorry I'm late.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.716
Nonsense, you're right on time.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.259
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Nice to see you.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.013
- This is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it?
- It's cooler at 8:00.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.264
Am I dressed okay?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.641
I didn't have
any of those short pant things.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.979
Actually, there is something missing.
Wait a minute.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.860
Here we go.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.280
- Now you look just like Tiger Woods.
- That's some hat.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
Okay, off you go, you two.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.868
- Have a wonderful time.
- We will.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.411
You bet.

13:23.218 --> 13:25.721
Is it hard to become a member here?

13:25.804 --> 13:29.266
Everyone has to go through
a thorough screening process.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.478
- Kind of like the FBI?
- We're much more thorough than that.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.854
- Wow.
- Yes.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.609
Do you know
the merger of Forscape and DSS...

13:38.692 --> 13:41.278
- happened right here on this lawn?
- Really?

13:41.737 --> 13:43.822
International finance
will never be the same...

13:43.906 --> 13:46.367
and all because of a lost golfing bet.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.036
- That's crazy.
- That's high finance.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.581
Here we are.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.545
What do you know about golf?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.216
That it's a good walk spoiled.

14:05.886 --> 14:09.973
Your driver is the most powerful club
in your bag...

14:10.474 --> 14:14.520
and as such,
it can be your most valuable asset...

14:14.603 --> 14:16.730
or your greatest liability.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.442
To wield it properly
requires a precise combination...

14:20.859 --> 14:22.945
of confidence and humility.

14:23.403 --> 14:26.448
- Confidence and humility. Got it.
- There you are.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.034
That's a pretty good natural grip.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.412
Now line the toe of your left foot
up with the ball.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.749
That's right. Drop this shoulder a little bit.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.294
Now, keeping your left arm firm,
draw the club back...

14:39.670 --> 14:42.297
and swing it cleanly through the ball.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.594
I'm betting that was wrong.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.764
There are no rights and wrongs
to the learning process.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.397
Try that again.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.865
I'm betting that was wrong.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.954
These are blueberries.
I ordered strawberries.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.957
- I know...
- I did. I wrote it down, I got a copy.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.501
- Sookie, listen.
- Yeah. "Mushrooms, melon..."

15:19.585 --> 15:23.338
- "endive, peaches, kiwi."
- Excuse me, crazy lady.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.299
I should make some kiwi ice cream.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.758
- Sookie! Listen.
- What?

15:26.842 --> 15:29.887
I know you ordered strawberries,
but they weren't any good.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.180
Instead of selling you
substandard strawberries...

15:32.264 --> 15:34.266
I brought you blueberries.

15:34.349 --> 15:36.643
I must make strawberry shortcake
for 200 people...

15:36.685 --> 15:38.437
so I think I'll need strawberries.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.480
- Use the blueberries.
- To make what?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.275
- Blueberry shortcake.
- There's no such thing.

15:43.358 --> 15:45.652
The world was flat
until someone took a boat trip.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.196
- Can I see these strawberries?
- No.

15:48.363 --> 15:49.656
- Just one?
- No.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.491
How about a Polaroid?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.911
Coffee.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.331
Sookie, can I take
some of this cake home to Rory?

15:57.414 --> 16:00.083
She's gonna need a special treat tonight.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.545
She's spending the entire day
with my father, golfing at the club.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.630
No.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.757
- Take the blueberries!
- No!

16:07.341 --> 16:09.635
The whole thing was masterminded
by my mother.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.262
One minute we're having
an excruciating family dinner...

16:12.346 --> 16:15.515
and the next minute she's manipulated
my kid to spend her Sunday...

16:15.599 --> 16:17.559
with my father at the country club.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.520
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's making me too upset.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.900
- Tell me something happy.
- I can't make the strawberry shortcake.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.736
You suck at this game.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.365
The battle for soup versus salad
is raging in the other room.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.991
Come quick and settle it, please.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.995
I'm running out of French curse words
that they won't understand.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.045
- Soup it's gonna be.
- You always have a salad...

16:45.128 --> 16:47.714
- before a traditional meal.
- Why are you making a scene?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.466
- It's my party.
- Just 'cause...

16:49.549 --> 16:52.302
It's been 45 minutes of "soup or salad."

16:52.386 --> 16:54.137
I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.723
I'm going to go far away now,
and never come back.

16:56.807 --> 17:00.268
How about if the guests
get a choice of soup or salad?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.647
That will work.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
- Choice of soup or salad.
- Got it.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.946
- It's so weird.
- Which one is which?

17:12.030 --> 17:13.781
I think the one on the right is Matt.

17:13.865 --> 17:17.118
No, that's the one on the left.
The one on the right is Mark.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.372
- That's very impressive.
- I'm very good at observing people...

17:20.454 --> 17:24.751
learning their tics and traits,
the sound of their voices. It's a gift.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.712
- That one has a Post-it on its back.
- Then that's Mark.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.297
The one on the right is Matt.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.216
- Take that off of him.
- I will not.

17:31.299 --> 17:33.969
We can't all call everyone "sweetie"
and get away with it.

17:34.052 --> 17:37.764
Go with me here, but let's say
Mark walks into a hotel room...

17:37.806 --> 17:40.183
and he sees his wife naked,
but it's not his wife...

17:40.267 --> 17:43.228
it's his naked sister-in-law,
and he has sex with her.

17:43.311 --> 17:45.522
- Would that be cheating?
- My head hurts.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.441
- I think no.
- Really? Lucky.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.486
If you ask me, this union
belongs on a public access station.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.323
It's against the laws of nature,
and just this short of completely obscene.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.118
You won't be giving the wedding toast.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.414
- How did everything work out?
- Do you have children?

18:02.497 --> 18:04.958
- A daughter.
- Do you hate her?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.751
- No.
- Not ever?

18:07.836 --> 18:10.630
I wasn't wildly fond of her during labor.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.341
That was the high point for me.

18:17.512 --> 18:20.348
- I can't believe I hit the ball.
- It's quite impressive.

18:20.432 --> 18:24.436
- It landed in the water.
- Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.

18:24.519 --> 18:26.605
This place is so beautiful.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.191
I could see just coming here
to think or read...

18:29.274 --> 18:32.277
but that defeats the purpose
of the holes with the flags in them.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.780
There is something rather serene
about walking around here.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.658
- Do you come here every week?
- No. When I can.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.994
I'm often working on the weekends.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.829
- Bummer.
- Isn't it?

18:46.666 --> 18:47.918
Hi, Richard.

18:49.377 --> 18:51.963
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

18:52.213 --> 18:55.008
- What do you do?
- I'm the Executive Vice President...

18:55.091 --> 18:57.260
of the Gehrman-Driscoll
Insurance Corporation.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.887
- Wow.
- Yes.

18:59.971 --> 19:03.099
And as Executive Vice President,
what do you do?

19:03.767 --> 19:07.520
It's a very big company,
one of the largest in the United States.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.272
I have a myriad of duties...

19:09.356 --> 19:12.192
which would bore you greatly
to hear about.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.069
Okay.

19:17.072 --> 19:21.034
- I oversee our international division.
- That sounds important.

19:21.117 --> 19:23.078
It rates a parking spot.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.289
- Do you get to travel a lot?
- Quite a bit.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.666
Lucky.

19:28.583 --> 19:31.920
- I suspect you have a yen for travel.
- I'm up to my ears in yens.

19:32.003 --> 19:35.298
- Any particular place you'd like to go?
- Hundreds of places:

19:35.382 --> 19:38.760
Paris, Rome, London,
Prague, Istanbul, Fez.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.721
- Have you ever been to Fez?
- I can't say that I have.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.556
I wanna go to Fez.

19:43.973 --> 19:47.310
I think traveling, for a young girl,
is a very important thing.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.562
Your mother never got a chance
to travel much.

19:49.646 --> 19:53.108
- I know. She talks about that all the time.
- She does?

19:53.316 --> 19:55.902
We've got a deal.
When I graduate from high school...

19:55.944 --> 19:58.863
we're gonna go backpacking
through Europe together.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.199
You know, do the whole hostel thing.

20:01.324 --> 20:05.787
- I just hope it really happens.
- We'll just have to make sure that it does.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.254
- You look wonderful.
- Aren't you sweet? Is Emily here?

20:14.295 --> 20:17.340
No, I'm taking my granddaughter
for a round of golf.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.260
- We must get together.
- Absolutely.

20:26.641 --> 20:28.768
The most odious woman alive.

20:40.321 --> 20:43.158
- We'll meet back here in 40 minutes?
- Okay.

20:43.658 --> 20:46.161
And then, if you like,
we can get some lunch.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.455
- That would be great.
- Fine.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.665
- Cool.
- Yes.

20:58.798 --> 21:01.259
And I'm telling him,
"I've been coming here..."

21:01.342 --> 21:04.804
"for 20 years, my young friend,
and for 20 years, that cart..."

21:04.846 --> 21:07.724
"Number 43, has been my golf cart."

21:07.807 --> 21:10.768
- He should have known that.
- Everybody knows it.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.813
- Did he give you the cart?
- Damn right he gave me the cart.

21:13.897 --> 21:18.109
You should have never had to ask,
because he should have known that.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.528
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Richard, good to see you.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.365
- I heard about your golf cart. Too bad.
- I'm still angry about it.

21:25.033 --> 21:28.369
Who was that young lady
I saw you on the golf course with?

21:28.453 --> 21:31.873
- That is my granddaughter.
- Really? She's lovely.

21:32.081 --> 21:33.625
Lorelai's girl.

21:34.292 --> 21:38.338
You're lucky. My granddaughter looks like
she just fell off a potato truck.

21:39.088 --> 21:41.966
My granddaughter
would never be caught here.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.011
It might get in the way
of her time spent at the tattoo parlor...

21:45.094 --> 21:48.014
or getting something pierced,
or doing whatever she does...

21:48.097 --> 21:51.643
while she runs wild through the streets
like a rabid dog.

21:51.726 --> 21:55.605
- Cut her off. That'll get her attention.
- I can help you with the litigation.

21:55.688 --> 21:57.982
Actually, Rory just started Chilton.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.984
- Really?
- Damn fine school.

22:00.318 --> 22:04.030
She said she wanted to learn golf.
I think she's taken to it quite well.

22:04.072 --> 22:07.617
Yeah, just as long as she's not taken
with a certain golf cart.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.954
- I'm writing a letter to the board.
- I wish you would.

22:11.746 --> 22:13.039
Listen to me.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.959
She took the house and I'm against it.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.753
She deserved it,
putting up with that tramp all those years.

22:18.836 --> 22:22.048
Last Christmas,
he bought them both the same bracelet.

22:22.131 --> 22:24.509
She should have shot him
like his first wife did.

22:24.592 --> 22:26.803
I love Janie. Is she out yet?

22:29.013 --> 22:31.057
Gloria, hi. Good game?

22:31.140 --> 22:33.935
- Not bad. You?
- I just came for the steam.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.521
We must get together and play
sometime soon.

22:36.604 --> 22:38.606
- Next week?
- I'll call you.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.070
The most odious woman alive.

22:53.788 --> 22:58.418
Okay, I need more tulle here.
I need the feeling of a major tutu, okay?

23:02.505 --> 23:06.467
Gary, the ribbons go on the chairs,
not on the trees.

23:08.928 --> 23:10.221
Oh, great.

23:14.308 --> 23:16.477
Where do you want the swans?

23:16.811 --> 23:19.230
- Do you know where the pond is?
- Nope.

23:19.313 --> 23:22.316
- You know that little road you came up?
- Nope.

23:22.942 --> 23:25.903
Do you know how to say "big help"
in Chinese?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.447
- Nope.
- Michel!

23:28.281 --> 23:29.949
This is 20 swans?

23:31.367 --> 23:32.869
Sure. Why not?

23:34.203 --> 23:35.496
You screeched?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.665
I need you to show him
where to put the swans.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.958
Absolutely not.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.628
I can't leave. I've got a major tulle festival
going on out here.

23:42.670 --> 23:45.298
- I will never go near those filthy birds.
- Why?

23:45.381 --> 23:48.009
- I hate the swans.
- These particular swans?

23:48.092 --> 23:49.594
No, all swans.

23:49.969 --> 23:52.805
I was attacked by a band of swans
in the Luxembourg Gardens...

23:52.847 --> 23:54.849
when I was a boy. No one forgets that.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.352
Oh, no, not being attacked
by a band of swans.

23:58.853 --> 24:02.982
Was it an all-boy band?
Kind of a scary, feathery, 'NSync fiasco?

24:03.149 --> 24:06.110
- This is not funny.
- No, I'm sorry. It's not funny at all.

24:06.694 --> 24:07.862
Oh, my God.

24:08.404 --> 24:11.324
Come on,
you have to admit that's a little funny.

24:11.407 --> 24:13.910
Hey, Pepe Le Pew,
you want to give me a hand with this?

24:13.993 --> 24:14.994
No.

24:15.703 --> 24:17.830
Listen, it's Drella or the swans.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.166
So either one beast of terror or another?

24:20.249 --> 24:22.001
- What is he babbling about?
- Don't...

24:22.043 --> 24:23.836
- He's afraid of the swans.
- Thank you.

24:23.878 --> 24:25.796
Of course he is. He's French.

24:26.172 --> 24:28.716
- Okay, I'll take you to the pond.
- Thank you.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.179
But stay far away from me.

24:39.936 --> 24:43.189
Can't stand the talk.
Love to watch the walk.

24:45.399 --> 24:47.902
She caught him in the pool house
with the tennis pro...

24:47.985 --> 24:49.779
not the riding instructor.

24:49.862 --> 24:51.113
I had no idea.

24:51.197 --> 24:54.742
That committee of yours is not
looking at people as much as you think.

24:54.825 --> 24:56.786
Why would they?
From what you've told me...

24:56.869 --> 24:59.914
they're all involved
in one nefarious activity after another.

24:59.997 --> 25:02.541
- It's a conspiracy.
- It's Peyton Place.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.169
- Is there more?
- Can you handle it?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.879
I'll steel myself.

25:07.588 --> 25:10.383
Okay, Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.

25:11.008 --> 25:13.010
Good God, he's my broker.

25:13.719 --> 25:16.472
I don't think one will affect the other.

25:16.847 --> 25:19.475
- Mind if we barge in?
- Look who's here.

25:20.476 --> 25:23.771
Rory, this is Julian Johnson
and Edward James.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.357
- Call me Ed.
- You can call me Ed, too.

25:27.775 --> 25:30.528
- It's nice to meet you.
- Would you care to join us?

25:30.611 --> 25:34.407
If Rory doesn't mind us intruding
on her time with her grandfather.

25:34.448 --> 25:36.701
- No, that's fine.
- Great.

25:37.576 --> 25:40.830
- So, we hear you're attending Chilton.
- I just started.

25:40.913 --> 25:42.748
- That's a hard school.
- Yes, sir.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.251
- Rory is an excellent student.
- Really?

25:45.334 --> 25:47.253
4.0 grade point average.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.714
That's got me beat.

25:52.508 --> 25:54.552
She's going to Fez someday.

25:54.635 --> 25:56.887
Fez? What the hell is in Fez?

25:57.471 --> 25:59.557
That's for her to find out.

26:11.527 --> 26:12.945
Interesting hat.

26:13.487 --> 26:16.115
I went golfing with my grandfather today.

26:16.198 --> 26:18.743
Did you know golf courses
are an environmental blight...

26:18.826 --> 26:21.245
because of the chemicals
used to keep the grass green?

26:21.328 --> 26:22.872
Actually, I did.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.041
Bad joke. Sorry.

26:33.424 --> 26:36.927
My God. This day,
the swans, the tulle, my head.

26:37.553 --> 26:39.722
I need the largest cheeseburger
in the world.

26:39.805 --> 26:41.307
Let's break a record, mister.

26:41.390 --> 26:45.770
So, the wedding is a nightmare.
We got these 10 boxes of creepy larvae...

26:45.853 --> 26:49.106
that are supposed to swarm
into butterflies on the wedding day.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.776
They swarmed a little early.
What's with the hat?

26:51.859 --> 26:53.152
Grandma gave it to me.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.738
- That's just mean.
- It's not that bad.

26:55.821 --> 26:58.282
- Do you want a mirror?
- I'm taking it off.

26:58.407 --> 27:02.369
- So, Rory's golfing adventure. Tell me.
- It was fine.

27:02.453 --> 27:06.165
I brought you some of Sookie's
chocolate cake to make you feel better.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.666
It really wasn't that bad.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.585
You're the sweetest kid
in the whole world.

27:09.668 --> 27:11.337
Where on earth did you get that from?

27:11.420 --> 27:14.965
Luke, am I mistaken,
or did the sign on the door say "open"?

27:15.049 --> 27:17.051
- So where were we?
- Me golfing.

27:17.134 --> 27:18.719
- Right. Go.
- Okay.

27:20.137 --> 27:22.598
By the end of the day
I could even hit the ball.

27:22.681 --> 27:25.309
Sometimes it wasn't my ball,
but the intentions were good.

27:25.392 --> 27:28.187
Good intentions
and no physical exertion whatsoever...

27:28.270 --> 27:30.231
is what the game of golf was built on.

27:30.272 --> 27:31.440
So did you order?

27:31.524 --> 27:34.109
I'm not hungry.
I had a big lunch at the club.

27:34.193 --> 27:36.362
With all the other devastators of our land.

27:36.445 --> 27:38.989
Luke, I'm really sorry. I didn't know.

27:40.699 --> 27:43.869
- You had a big lunch at the club?
- Yeah, it was quite good.

27:43.911 --> 27:46.997
- Quite? What's with the "quite"?
- What do you mean?

27:47.081 --> 27:48.582
You don't ever say "quite."

27:48.666 --> 27:50.960
- I've said "quite" plenty of times.
- Whatever.

27:51.043 --> 27:54.463
Besides the "quite good" lunch you had,
what else happened?

27:54.546 --> 27:58.217
Nothing. We played. I met his friends.
I took a steam.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.261
- You took a steam?
- Yeah.

28:00.302 --> 28:03.430
I sweated out all my toxins,
and I stole a towel.

28:04.807 --> 28:07.184
- Sounds like you really had a good time.
- I did.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.727
Really?

28:10.062 --> 28:13.023
- Okay, new word now.
- Sorry. I'm just surprised.

28:13.691 --> 28:17.528
- I thought you were gonna be bored.
- I was kind of surprised, too.

28:17.611 --> 28:20.698
I don't know, it was pretty there.
And Grandpa and I talked a lot.

28:20.781 --> 28:23.325
- You talked? Really?
- You're doing it again.

28:23.409 --> 28:24.952
Sorry. You talked?

28:25.661 --> 28:28.831
- We talked about Fez.
- And he thought it was a hat.

28:28.914 --> 28:32.876
I told him about our backpacking trip,
and he thought it was a great idea.

28:35.129 --> 28:37.214
So you really had fun?

28:39.341 --> 28:40.843
That's great.

28:41.302 --> 28:44.263
That is really, really great.

28:46.473 --> 28:49.893
- I thought you were starving.
- Things change. Move on.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.231
Does this hat really look bad on me?

28:59.903 --> 29:02.781
No, I think it looks kind of cute.

29:09.204 --> 29:12.166
It's your wedding day. Feel each other.

29:12.249 --> 29:15.085
Use the thumping of your heart
as a metronome.

29:15.169 --> 29:18.172
Let passion be your choreographer.

29:18.380 --> 29:22.009
Be as light on your toes
as you are in your hearts.

29:22.176 --> 29:25.137
Oh, no, darling.
Let me show you how it's done.

29:25.179 --> 29:26.388
Again?

29:28.474 --> 29:31.185
You know, in some countries,
if you dance this close...

29:31.268 --> 29:33.479
you're cheating on your wife.

29:33.729 --> 29:35.939
- You're next.
- Take your time.

29:51.747 --> 29:54.291
- My God, you've good handwriting.
- Thank you.

29:54.374 --> 29:57.711
You did not get that from me.
Your fabulous flair you got from me.

29:57.795 --> 30:01.131
- I also got my deviated septum from you.
- Hey, focus on the flair.

30:01.215 --> 30:03.258
It's for you. He says he's your father...

30:03.342 --> 30:05.803
although why he'd volunteer that freely,
I don't know.

30:05.886 --> 30:07.012
- My father?
- Yes.

30:07.054 --> 30:10.349
- Are you sure?
- Please just take the phone. Thank you.

30:10.974 --> 30:11.975
Dad?

30:12.768 --> 30:15.687
Yeah, it's Lorelai.
Who else calls you "dad"?

30:17.439 --> 30:20.442
Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.
It's for you.

30:21.527 --> 30:23.654
Thanks. Hello?

30:24.446 --> 30:27.199
Hey, Grandpa. That's great.

30:29.076 --> 30:31.745
Jackie wants Samuel Barber,
John Cage, and Philip Glass...

30:31.828 --> 30:34.706
and Jessica wants
Shania Twain's I Feel Like a Woman.

30:34.790 --> 30:36.542
- I'm not a jukebox.
- Oh, please.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.335
You think I started playing the harp...

30:38.418 --> 30:42.130
'cause I thought it would make me cool?
Finally get me in with the in-crowd?

30:42.214 --> 30:45.050
Maybe I'd make for some
great happy-hour conversation.

30:45.092 --> 30:47.803
No, all right? The music drives me, lady.

30:47.886 --> 30:50.514
I will play what I feel, and you will love it.

30:50.597 --> 30:54.476
- I'll give you an extra $100.
- You just got yourself a jukebox.

30:59.189 --> 31:01.191
Yeah, I'd love to see it.

31:02.818 --> 31:04.570
No, if you want to.

31:05.696 --> 31:08.115
Sure. That sounds good. Yeah.

31:19.751 --> 31:21.795
Should I leave you two alone?

31:22.462 --> 31:25.340
- I think I want to change my hair.
- Really?

31:25.465 --> 31:27.968
- I think it looks quite good.
- You're funny.

31:28.844 --> 31:31.471
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yeah, water.

31:37.352 --> 31:40.063
- So, you talked to Grandpa today?
- What?

31:40.522 --> 31:42.858
- Grandpa, he called?
- Yeah.

31:43.483 --> 31:45.027
Anything wrong?

31:45.110 --> 31:47.946
No, he just found this book
we were talking about.

31:50.157 --> 31:53.118
- And he just called to tell you?
- Yeah. Why?

31:53.618 --> 31:57.372
Nothing. It's just weird.
He doesn't call the inn that much.

31:57.456 --> 31:59.124
Or ever, actually.

31:59.708 --> 32:02.586
- He knew that I was looking for it, so...
- Oh, sure.

32:02.919 --> 32:05.464
- What book is it?
- Mencken's Chrestomathy.

32:05.756 --> 32:07.799
- Oh, that one.
- Yeah.

32:09.593 --> 32:13.221
Cinnamon is stuck
under our front porch again.

32:13.305 --> 32:16.016
Can I borrow some vegetable oil
and a shoehorn?

32:16.099 --> 32:18.935
- I'll get it.
- I'm calling him and calling him...

32:19.019 --> 32:20.145
and I go around the porch...

32:20.228 --> 32:23.273
and this big orange tush
is just staring me in the face.

32:23.356 --> 32:24.399
I hate when that happens.

32:24.483 --> 32:27.319
Yeah. He must have been meowing
for an hour...

32:27.360 --> 32:30.989
but Morey was playing some Thelonious
on the Steinway...

32:31.073 --> 32:33.700
and when Morey plays,
I go into this trance...

32:33.784 --> 32:37.788
where all I can see is blue,
and moon, and stars.

32:40.248 --> 32:43.293
Never mind, sugar. Play me home, baby!

32:49.216 --> 32:50.258
Bye.

32:52.552 --> 32:54.930
Oh, God! It's killing me!

33:00.477 --> 33:02.771
- Babbette didn't take her oil.
- Keep it.

33:02.854 --> 33:05.023
Christmas is early this year.

33:05.482 --> 33:06.691
You know what I was thinking?

33:06.733 --> 33:08.902
That Madonna and Sean Penn
should get remarried?

33:08.985 --> 33:09.986
Besides that.

33:10.070 --> 33:13.865
I was thinking your golfing expedition
should totally count as a dinner.

33:13.907 --> 33:16.243
- What do you mean?
- I can get us out of dinner...

33:16.326 --> 33:19.538
at the grandparents' on Friday.
Maybe we could grab a movie.

33:20.914 --> 33:23.625
- That's okay.
- It's no big deal, really.

33:24.209 --> 33:26.461
No. It's just gonna get Grandma
all freaked out.

33:26.545 --> 33:29.464
I can handle those freak-outs.
I've done that.

33:30.757 --> 33:34.386
I have to get the book
from Grandpa anyway. Let's just go.

33:36.179 --> 33:38.890
- All right, if you really want to.
- I do.

33:40.725 --> 33:42.060
Okay, fine.

33:44.396 --> 33:46.022
- Is that my sweater?
- What?

33:46.106 --> 33:48.400
- You're wearing my sweater.
- So?

33:49.818 --> 33:51.736
No, it's okay. It's just...

33:51.820 --> 33:55.574
I thought I asked you to at least ask
before you borrow my stuff.

33:55.615 --> 33:57.492
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

33:59.411 --> 34:02.664
It's not too much for a simple
"Can I borrow it, Mom?" is it?

34:02.747 --> 34:05.041
No, it's not. Jeez, lighten up.

34:07.085 --> 34:08.753
It's my favorite sweater, too.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.547
- Since when?
- Since always.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.799
- This is not your favorite sweater.
- Yes, it is.

34:12.882 --> 34:15.844
Now it's gonna be stretched out,
like everything you borrow.

34:15.927 --> 34:17.094
What are you talking about?

34:17.137 --> 34:19.222
I'm talking about
that you take my sweaters...

34:19.306 --> 34:21.016
wear them, and stretch them out.

34:21.099 --> 34:24.936
I couldn't possibly stretch them out.
Your boobs are way bigger than mine.

34:25.020 --> 34:26.730
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

34:26.813 --> 34:30.150
- Your boobs are totally bigger than mine.
- You're crazy!

34:30.233 --> 34:31.818
- Do you want to measure?
- What?

34:31.900 --> 34:34.529
I'm serious. Why don't you go
get the measuring tape now?

34:34.612 --> 34:36.281
I am not going to measure my boobs.

34:36.322 --> 34:38.867
Because you know
that you are totally bigger.

34:38.949 --> 34:40.368
- I'm going inside.
- Fine.

34:40.452 --> 34:43.204
- Don't measure. We'll just compare bras.
- Stop it.

34:43.288 --> 34:45.581
I'll stop it when you quit stealing my stuff!

34:45.665 --> 34:47.000
You're cracked!

34:48.168 --> 34:49.627
You're bigger!

34:59.804 --> 35:03.016
"Your boobs are bigger than mine"?
I'm a mental case.

35:03.099 --> 35:04.225
So apologize.

35:04.309 --> 35:06.603
I was too mad and stupid
to apologize last night...

35:06.686 --> 35:08.688
and she was gone
before I got up this morning.

35:08.772 --> 35:11.941
- What is wrong with me?
- You're very possessive of your sweaters.

35:12.025 --> 35:15.445
I understand. If somebody
breathes too hard on my paring knife...

35:15.528 --> 35:17.572
I'm like a crazy spider monkey.

35:17.655 --> 35:19.157
It's not about the sweater.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.619
It's about the golfing thing
and the liking-it thing.

35:22.827 --> 35:26.039
She had fun, Sookie,
just like my mother said she would.

35:26.122 --> 35:29.334
- Yeah, that's gotta hurt.
- She should have fun.

35:29.459 --> 35:32.337
I want her to have a good relationship
with her grandparents.

35:32.378 --> 35:35.507
Just because I don't
doesn't mean she shouldn't, right?

35:36.800 --> 35:40.553
So then, why was I trying to
get her out of Friday night dinner?

35:40.637 --> 35:42.639
Am I trying to
undermine their relationship?

35:42.722 --> 35:43.890
- You weren't.
- I was.

35:43.973 --> 35:45.809
- Yes, you were.
- Yes, I'm 4 years old.

35:45.892 --> 35:47.685
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

35:47.769 --> 35:50.772
You are. You're jealous
'cause they like Rory better than you.

35:50.855 --> 35:52.524
Thank you for the hug.

35:52.565 --> 35:54.150
See, I'm bad at advice talks.

35:54.234 --> 35:56.611
Can we talk about soup?
'Cause I'm good with soup.

35:56.694 --> 35:59.489
I'm sorry. You're fine. I'm all mixed-up.

35:59.572 --> 36:02.700
I left that life: The club, my parents.

36:02.784 --> 36:04.285
I ran from it as soon as I could.

36:04.369 --> 36:08.081
It just never occurred to me
that she might want it.

36:08.289 --> 36:11.501
It occurred to my mother though.
God, I hate that she was right.

36:11.584 --> 36:13.795
You don't know that... Oh, my God.

36:13.878 --> 36:15.338
Hey, watch it!

36:16.548 --> 36:17.632
Stock.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.093
Are you okay?

36:22.345 --> 36:25.390
Look at you. You're beautiful!

36:27.100 --> 36:28.893
I have to be more adult about this.

36:28.977 --> 36:31.688
I mean, if the country club life
is what she wants...

36:31.771 --> 36:33.481
more power to her, right?

36:33.565 --> 36:36.234
You know, little white gloves
and coming-out parties.

36:36.276 --> 36:39.237
- That makes some girls happy, right?
- Sure, yeah.

36:39.279 --> 36:41.531
If they're on Prozac, absolutely.

36:41.614 --> 36:44.826
I just never thought
that I raised that kind of kid, you know?

36:44.909 --> 36:47.245
Not that there's anything wrong
with kids like that.

36:47.287 --> 36:49.998
I didn't think that was Rory.
Maybe it's not. I don't know.

36:50.081 --> 36:52.750
Am I obsessing? Sookie? Hello?

36:53.501 --> 36:56.129
Should I wear my strawberry costume
to get your attention?

36:56.212 --> 36:57.714
No, I'm sorry.

36:58.131 --> 36:59.757
You have a strawberry costume?

36:59.841 --> 37:02.719
- Unbelievable!
- Jackson.

37:03.094 --> 37:04.804
So this is what we've come to?

37:04.888 --> 37:08.266
You sneaking around behind my back
buying somebody else's strawberries?

37:08.349 --> 37:10.977
- I was desperate!
- You disgust me!

37:11.060 --> 37:14.355
- I needed the strawberries.
- Well, now you have them.

37:14.689 --> 37:16.357
I hope you're happy together.

37:16.441 --> 37:18.401
- Jackson, wait!
- No!

37:18.693 --> 37:20.820
- Come on, Jackson!
- No!

37:20.903 --> 37:22.864
- Jackson, we can talk about it.
- No!

37:22.947 --> 37:24.616
- Get back here!
- Get away from me!

37:24.699 --> 37:26.534
Why are you following me?

37:26.618 --> 37:28.578
- Don't you follow me.
- Come on!

38:24.550 --> 38:27.136
Pardon me. There you are.

38:28.930 --> 38:30.932
We did it. We sure did.

38:32.809 --> 38:35.019
God, I feel wonderful!

38:35.103 --> 38:37.355
I'm so glad it turned out
the way you wanted it to.

38:37.438 --> 38:38.481
You have no idea.

38:38.564 --> 38:42.944
They just told me they're going to share
a condo in Tucson, Arizona.

38:43.027 --> 38:45.530
That's hundreds of miles away.

38:45.738 --> 38:47.782
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

38:48.199 --> 38:50.201
Sister Sledge! Excuse me.

39:05.216 --> 39:07.009
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.470
- Good turnout?
- Yeah.

39:09.679 --> 39:12.181
- Want something to drink?
- Are you trying to make up?

39:12.223 --> 39:15.685
- No, I'm trying to hydrate you.
- I'm fine, thanks.

39:17.937 --> 39:19.772
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

39:19.856 --> 39:23.442
A crazy, evil spirit obsessed with bra size
took over my body.

39:23.526 --> 39:25.236
- It happens.
- She's gone now.

39:25.278 --> 39:26.779
Good to know.

39:27.864 --> 39:30.074
I'm glad you're bonding
with your grandparents.

39:30.158 --> 39:31.659
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

39:31.742 --> 39:35.371
It's just weird for me, is all.
I just can't relate to it.

39:35.997 --> 39:38.875
- You could if you tried.
- No. We're too...

39:39.834 --> 39:41.711
Too much has happened.

39:43.504 --> 39:45.214
I'm glad you are, anyway.

39:47.425 --> 39:50.386
I didn't mean to cut you off from them
so completely, you know.

39:50.469 --> 39:52.054
It just happened.

39:52.138 --> 39:55.099
Not having them in my life
just felt so right.

39:55.433 --> 39:57.393
I just never thought...

39:58.019 --> 39:59.395
I'm sorry.

39:59.854 --> 40:02.356
I did not pay $500 for this dress...

40:02.523 --> 40:06.277
so you could run around and mess it up.
Now you sit and be still.

40:06.319 --> 40:08.613
Cross your legs. You're a lady.

40:13.367 --> 40:17.413
God, I must have had a million dresses
like that when I was a kid.

40:17.622 --> 40:20.166
- It doesn't really scream "you."
- No.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.960
I did all the screaming.

40:26.297 --> 40:29.133
Thank you for not putting me
in a dress like that.

40:29.634 --> 40:31.135
You're welcome.

40:31.844 --> 40:34.472
Of course, wearing those dresses...
Not all bad.

40:34.555 --> 40:37.350
Oh, no.
They really fly up when you twirl around.

40:37.433 --> 40:41.395
And if you're wearing
that ruffled underwear, big crowd pleaser.

40:44.398 --> 40:48.819
If it makes you feel better, I think
I got a fungus from the steam room.

40:49.278 --> 40:51.781
It does. Thank you.

41:13.427 --> 41:15.429
Oh, good. You're here.

41:15.513 --> 41:16.806
Hi, Grandma.

41:16.889 --> 41:19.642
- My goodness. What's that?
- We brought dessert.

41:19.725 --> 41:22.520
- Really? How thoughtful! What is it?
- Blueberry shortcake.

41:22.603 --> 41:26.148
- I've never heard of blueberry shortcake.
- It's a Stars Hollow specialty.

41:26.232 --> 41:28.943
- Why is it already cut?
- It's left over.

41:29.026 --> 41:30.694
From the wedding.

41:30.736 --> 41:32.029
At the inn.

41:32.071 --> 41:33.364
I know where the wedding was.

41:33.406 --> 41:35.616
Sorry. You were just doing
that staring thing.

41:35.699 --> 41:39.495
- You brought us used dessert?
- It's not used. It's left over.

41:39.537 --> 41:40.663
How nice.

41:40.746 --> 41:44.458
I'll just put it in the kitchen
next to my half-empty box of cheer.

41:44.875 --> 41:47.044
She's in a good mood tonight.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.754
Can I get you a drink?

41:48.838 --> 41:51.173
- White wine would be great.
- Coke.

41:51.924 --> 41:55.803
Did Rory tell you all about
the wonderful time she had at the club?

41:55.886 --> 41:59.306
- She sure did.
- Your father was simply flying all week.

41:59.557 --> 42:02.643
- She really charmed him.
- Lf anybody could, it would be her.

42:02.726 --> 42:06.063
In this age of MTV
and 100 television channels...

42:06.355 --> 42:09.066
who would have thought
a girl could still get a thrill...

42:09.150 --> 42:11.360
spending a simple afternoon
with her grandfather?

42:11.402 --> 42:13.237
That wine would be real good right now.

42:13.279 --> 42:16.282
I think we should consider
getting her a membership at the club.

42:16.365 --> 42:17.449
If she wants, sure.

42:17.533 --> 42:19.869
To have a place to go
where she can socialize.

42:19.952 --> 42:21.745
That's very important to a young girl.

42:21.787 --> 42:24.957
Now especially that the crack den
has closed down on the corner...

42:25.040 --> 42:27.626
all her really good friends are gone.

42:28.711 --> 42:32.214
What do you think,
should I pursue the career in comedy?

42:32.590 --> 42:36.427
It's just very interesting
the way things turn out, isn't it?

42:37.595 --> 42:39.180
Oh, you're here.

42:39.805 --> 42:41.223
- Lorelai.
- Dad.

42:41.307 --> 42:43.309
Rory, I have a surprise.

42:43.559 --> 42:47.146
Not only did I find that copy of
Mencken's Chrestomathy we discussed...

42:47.229 --> 42:49.815
I also found a first edition
of his memoirs as well.

42:49.899 --> 42:52.776
- You're kidding.
- It's in my office if you'd like to see them.

42:52.860 --> 42:55.029
Oh, my God, I totally would.

42:57.114 --> 42:59.825
I'd like to take a look at those myself.
