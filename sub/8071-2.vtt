Lanford Custom Cycle.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.549
It's the bank.

00:15.583 --> 00:19.120
Don't get upset if I
have to start crying.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.888
You did mail the
loan check in, right?

00:20.921 --> 00:21.722
Of course.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.895
Uh-huh.

00:27.928 --> 00:28.862
Oh, no.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.631
No, I realize I was
a couple of days

00:30.664 --> 00:33.234
late sending it in last month,
but this month, I made sure

00:33.267 --> 00:34.468
that I sent it in right away.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.206
Oh.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.740
Oh, I forgot to sign it?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.178
Oh, that's so unlike me.

00:46.847 --> 00:47.881
Well, listen.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.317
You have my permission.
It's a good check.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.218
You go ahead and cash it.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.955
Oh.
Oh, you need the signature?

00:54.988 --> 00:56.957
I didn't know that.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.858
OK.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.792
Well, let me tell you.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.027
I'll, uh, leave here right away.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.061
I'm on my way.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.430
I'm in-- I'm in a
big hurry, and I'll

01:02.463 --> 01:04.598
be there in a couple minutes.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.699
OK, thank you.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.205
What are you gonna tell
them once you get down there?

01:11.239 --> 01:12.573
How can I think
about that now,

01:12.606 --> 01:15.709
Dan, when my tire blew and I'm
stuck in a ditch on Route 49?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.047
Coffee?

01:20.080 --> 01:23.951
[theme music]

02:09.463 --> 02:11.965
Oh, man.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.367
What is it?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.269
I stayed up till 1:30 last night
making this casserole for you

02:15.303 --> 02:16.170
guys to eat.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.406
How come you didn't eat it?

02:18.439 --> 02:19.507
Well, gee, Mom,
I guess it just

02:19.540 --> 02:23.076
wasn't a casserole kind of day.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.612
Well, what did you eat, then?

02:24.645 --> 02:25.946
I wasn't hungry.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.847
What about DJ?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.048
Did he eat?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.384
I think Becky gave him
like cereal or something.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.719
Cereal?

02:31.752 --> 02:32.886
If he wanted cereal,
there's plenty

02:32.920 --> 02:34.154
of cereal in the casserole.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.592
Did he brush his teeth?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.827
Did he take a bath?

02:39.860 --> 02:40.861
I don't know.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.463
Did you put him to sleep?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.531
I didn't know I
had that option.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.169
ROSEANNE Where in the
hell have you been?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.904
I went out for
pizza with Mark.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.706
Man, you guys are
like totally useless.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.475
Look at this place.
It's a pigsty.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.543
I want you to pick it up.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.411
Hey, this is all
Darlene's stuff.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.447
It is not.
These shoes are yours.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.449
Yeah, but the socks and
the sweatshirt are yours.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.317
Oh, please.
What about these magazines?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.151
Oh, look.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.690
The porch is a big mess, too.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.024
Oh, real mature, Mom.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.997
Man, this family is
falling apart, Dad.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.034
It's tough to stop
a moving train, honey.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.703
I can't work at
the shop anymore.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.171
Rosie, we've
been through this.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.906
But I got too much to do, Dan.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.941
I got the restaurant,
the kids, the house.

03:27.975 --> 03:28.842
I quit.

03:28.876 --> 03:29.743
You can't quit.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.446
You're an owner.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.616
OK, well, then I'm fired.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.319
I can't do any repair work
and keep my eye on the shop.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.520
I need you there.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.889
Well, something has to
change around here, then.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.492
You guys get in here.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.793
How'd they get so
spoiled when we've

03:45.826 --> 03:47.094
given them absolutely nothing?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.266
You guys sit down.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.435
We're having a little
family meeting.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.305
What a bunch of crap.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.273
Well, those are the
minutes of our last meeting.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.576
Now onto new business.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.512
OK, here's the deal.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.380
We're having a tough
time now, girls.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.282
We're trying to turn the
corner on the bike shop, which

04:08.316 --> 04:10.518
means we're killing ourselves.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.821
If you guys don't help out,
we're not going to make it.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.456
You're right, Dad.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.025
We let you down and
we're really sorry.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.092
Meeting adjourned.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.594
DAN: Darlene.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.431
Don't, because no matter how
lousy you think your life

04:23.464 --> 04:25.599
is now, we can make
it much, much worse.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.872
Now, here's what I see.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.341
Nothing's getting
done around here

04:33.374 --> 04:35.576
because nobody takes
any responsibility

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
for anything, OK?

04:36.810 --> 04:41.482
So from now on, Becky,
I'm leaving you in charge.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.718
I have a problem with that.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.553
Tough.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.291
So I'm just supposed
to do whatever she says?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.793
We expect that you
will listen to Becky

04:52.826 --> 04:54.895
the same way you listen to us.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.330
Um, now I have a problem.

04:59.199 --> 05:02.035
Well, you'll work it out.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.404
And you will take
care of your brother.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.406
You make sure that
he washes himself

05:05.439 --> 05:06.540
and that he does his homework.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.541
Yeah.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.043
And you make sure
that he eats, too.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.979
Now, I'm gonna weigh that
little boy every night.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.085
And if he loses more than
two pounds, it's your butt.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.721
You got that?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.523
OK.
ROSEANNE Good.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.591
Now go clean something.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.730
All right.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.665
Good idea.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.000
Those two are always
crying about how we

05:33.033 --> 05:34.101
don't treat them like adults.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.002
Now we are.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.169
This may work.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.438
Are you insane, Dan?

05:37.471 --> 05:39.339
I just put Becky in charge.

05:39.373 --> 05:44.745
That's like putting Fredo in
charge of the Corleone family.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.914
They may surprise us.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.248
Come on, Dan.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.452
The family is doomed unless
I can get out of that shop.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.887
Well, once we start
selling a few bikes,

05:53.921 --> 05:56.223
we might have the cash to
hire somebody to replace you.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.426
You mean you're saying
like if I sell a bike,

05:58.459 --> 05:59.960
I can get out of there?

05:59.993 --> 06:03.296
Well, that's one way to
look at it, but, you know, I--

06:03.330 --> 06:05.332
I thought of us more as a team.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.036
You know, you and me against
the world, husband and wife.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.003
Partners.

06:10.037 --> 06:10.838
Any bike, right?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.811
Well, yeah, I know that
Duke already has a bike,

06:17.845 --> 06:19.212
but you don't.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.714
I don't need a bike, Roseanne.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.215
I ride behind Duke.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.051
Oh, so that's how it's
going to be for the whole rest

06:24.084 --> 06:26.219
of your life?
You're gonna ride behind him?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.656
Not at his side, not equal
to him, but like behind him?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.790
Leon.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.959
Hey, I already gave you
permission to smack her.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.093
What about you, Leon?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.361
Did you ever think of
getting a motorcycle?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.663
Ha.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.499
Roseanne, name me one guy
that hasn't pictured himself

06:38.532 --> 06:41.334
out there on a big chopper,
going down a country

06:41.368 --> 06:43.270
road with the wind in his hair.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.038
Because you know we've
got some really great bikes.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.306
The answer is me.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.140
I'm the guy.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.746
All's I'm asking
is for one person

06:52.780 --> 06:54.114
to buy one lousy motorcycle.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.450
Is that too much to ask?

06:56.484 --> 06:59.186
Roseanne, what
is your problem?

06:59.219 --> 07:01.555
I have got all of
your PMS days circled

07:01.589 --> 07:04.224
over there on my calendar.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.660
This is not one of them.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.697
Oh, I'm just really
stressed out, Leon.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.098
I understand.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.934
You need a little distraction.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.370
Have you ever
considered waitressing?

07:17.404 --> 07:18.506
All right.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.008
You're right.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.442
Oh, look.
There's Jackie.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.511
Here, hold this, would you?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.377
[gasps]

07:25.445 --> 07:26.780
Oh, Jackie, you look great.

07:26.814 --> 07:27.681
I love the dress.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.016
Your hair is great.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.551
I don't like
this job, Roseanne.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.386
Why?
What's the matter with it?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.888
Would you like to
sample our new fragrance?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.323
Would you like to sample
our new fragrance?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.525
That's all I do all day long.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.959
Would you like to sample
our new fragrance?

07:38.992 --> 07:42.596
God, I'm annoying.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.566
Jackie, you begged me to pull
some strings to get you a--

07:45.599 --> 07:46.834
JACKIE: I know, but--
ROSEANNE --in the store.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.836
JACKIE: --I thought, makeup
department, you know,

07:48.869 --> 07:52.039
I get to do makeovers,
like a cosmetician.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.006
Well, it's your first day.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.575
You've got to work your way up.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.344
Do you know how many
squirt girls have to die

07:57.377 --> 08:00.781
before I make cosmetician?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.015
Well, fine, Jackie.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.517
Try my life, OK?

08:03.551 --> 08:06.053
Go work over at the
bike shop for no money

08:06.086 --> 08:07.555
and then have to come
here to this dump

08:07.588 --> 08:09.156
and work for Preppy
the Clown here.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.194
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.929
Leon, I need to
get Friday off, OK?

08:15.963 --> 08:16.764
[scoffs]

08:17.798 --> 08:18.999
Well, gee, I don't
know, Roseanne.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.601
I mean, where am I
going to find somebody

08:20.634 --> 08:22.002
to stand in the middle
of my restaurant

08:22.035 --> 08:25.305
and do nothing on
such short notice?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.740
See what I have
to put up with?

08:31.745 --> 08:34.948
Now, this here, this bike
isn't for everybody, you know.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.384
I mean, this is a
real outlaw bike.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.687
It's like "The Beastmaster".

08:39.720 --> 08:43.724
And this is called
our Commuter Special.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.626
Well, see this seat right here?

08:45.659 --> 08:48.161
It's really cool because there's
nothing for her to hold on to,

08:48.195 --> 08:49.429
you know.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.165
She's got to like wrap
herself around you real good.

08:52.199 --> 08:56.303
I mean, you know, she
either does that or splat.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.538
Yeah, and the baby
fits real snug

08:58.572 --> 09:02.710
right here in the safety seat.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.378
Oh, so-- so your
name's Murray, huh?

09:05.412 --> 09:07.447
That's really a coincidence
because, you know,

09:07.480 --> 09:09.917
Evel Knievel, his real
first name is Murray.

09:09.950 --> 09:10.818
Yeah.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.821
Murray Knievel.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.723
It's loud and it's mean.

09:15.756 --> 09:20.427
It screams, get
out of my damn way!

09:20.460 --> 09:23.697
Not a single dolphin was
harmed to make this motorcycle.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.703
We're open till 10:00.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.504
We're here till 11:00.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.973
Every night till midnight.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.942
We never close.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.409
We never close.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.878
Never close.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.812
Never close.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.224
Oh, this is disgusting.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.094
If you don't like
it, then don't eat it.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.496
I don't even know
what the hell it is.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.098
It's spaghetti with
Thousand Island dressing.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.803
God!

10:02.836 --> 10:04.872
That is so gross.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.840
Well, maybe if you
hadn't dumped the laundry

10:06.874 --> 10:08.575
and the vacuuming on
me, I would've had time

10:08.608 --> 10:10.678
to plan a more exciting menu.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.713
Hey, I have been
running around all day.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.348
Picking DJ up from school,
taking him to get shoes,

10:15.382 --> 10:16.984
going to the supermarket.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.152
And when I get home, I expect
a decent meal on the table.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.491
Don't they make
a lovely couple.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.759
Remember when we
were first married?

10:25.793 --> 10:28.428
We used to have bread and
mayonnaise for dinner.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.064
How come you don't
make that anymore?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.333
I say we make a run for it
out the backdoor, quiet-like.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.634
Good idea.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.468
BECKY: Mother!

10:38.605 --> 10:41.108
You will not believe what
Darlene just made for dinner.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.009
Hey.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.877
DJ loves it.

10:43.911 --> 10:44.912
DJ eats hair.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.451
I'm telling you, you better
make something edible

10:51.484 --> 10:52.485
for dinner tomorrow night.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.687
Or what, you're
going to spank me?

10:53.721 --> 10:55.555
See?
This goes on all day.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.690
Total disrespect.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.826
Look, I'm not going
to be the referee.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.194
As long as your dad and me
are working 15 hour days,

11:01.228 --> 11:03.130
you're going to have to
run this house without us.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.331
Yeah, but you're home now.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.165
No, we're not.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.470
Well, Dan, I tried
everything I could

11:10.503 --> 11:11.872
think of today to sell a bike.

11:11.905 --> 11:12.906
I-- I lied.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.807
I pushed.

11:13.841 --> 11:14.908
I nagged.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.143
Well, you went with
your strengths, dear.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.214
Well, how come
none of it worked?

11:21.248 --> 11:22.916
Well, I didn't have any
more luck than you did.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.185
We're just going to
have to hang in there.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.519
BECKY: Mother, I've had it!

11:26.553 --> 11:29.356
Darlene refuses to do the
dishes, and it's her turn.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.257
I cooked.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.225
Is that not enough?

11:32.259 --> 11:33.927
What am I supposed
to do about her?

11:33.961 --> 11:34.828
Becky, I told you.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.696
You're in charge.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.898
Well, fine.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.599
I'm just going to leave
the dishes where they are.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.901
And tomorrow, they'll
be covered with

11:40.934 --> 11:45.405
dried, crusty, disgusting crud.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.439
Fine.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.041
Tomorrow night, it's leftovers.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.386
God, you know,
Dan, these biker

11:59.419 --> 12:01.654
magazines ain't nothing
but a bunch of naked ladies

12:01.688 --> 12:04.958
sitting up on motorcycles.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.393
That is so degrading to women.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.298
You know, every
one of these girls

12:11.331 --> 12:15.468
has a mother out there
somewhere who's dying of shame.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.369
Oh, wait.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.871
I'm wrong.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.541
Here's a naked girl and her
naked mother in the sidecar.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.542
[bell ringing]

12:22.575 --> 12:23.376
Customer.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.816
Oh, it's just you.

12:28.849 --> 12:32.752
- Well, it's just you, too.
- I'm sorry.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.955
What are you doing here?
- I had a bad day.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.489
I need to whine.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.690
What happened?

12:37.724 --> 12:41.194
I sprayed perfume on some
woman and she kicked me.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.899
Well, maybe she didn't
want to get sprayed.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.869
Well, no one wants to be
sprayed, Roseanne, but damn it,

12:48.902 --> 12:51.905
I had a quota.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.973
Hey.

12:53.006 --> 12:53.874
Hi, Dan.

12:53.907 --> 12:54.707
What smells?

12:58.111 --> 12:58.979
Remember?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.047
I told you, honey.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.615
Jackie's the perfume
sniper at the mall.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.818
Oh, right.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.153
[bell ringing]

13:06.186 --> 13:07.587
DAN: Hey, how are you doing?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.857
OK.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.391
Anything I can help you with?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.061
I'm, um, just looking.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.829
I pass by this place
on my way to work.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.165
Just thought I'd check it out.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.600
You ride?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.169
I always wanted to.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.636
What are you waiting for?

13:23.670 --> 13:26.339
Oh, my wife
would never let me.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.508
I understand.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.477
Feel free to look around.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.411
Thanks.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.048
His wife's it's a big bogey.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.449
Well, hey, I ride.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.286
Why don't you bring your wife
by and I'll give her a pep talk?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.220
I don't think so.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.957
We just got a divorce.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.858
Oh.

13:44.892 --> 13:45.959
Oh, sorry to hear that.

13:45.993 --> 13:46.927
That's too bad.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.362
It happens.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.763
Um.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.133
Well, thanks.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.302
Hey, I bet it'd really
bug your wife to see

13:55.335 --> 13:56.536
you on one of these things now.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.709
Oh, yeah.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.879
Yeah, I mean, you end up
with a bike you always wanted,

14:05.913 --> 14:07.380
and what does she end up with?
What?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.215
The kids?

14:10.350 --> 14:14.387
It would definitely kill her.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.457
Definitely.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.426
You got him.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.229
So what's your name?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.496
- Art.
- Hi, Art.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.397
I'm Roseanne.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.698
And this is Jackie.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.599
Say hi, Jackie.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.969
Hi, Art.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.237
So what do you do
for a living, Art?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.071
No, wait.
Wait.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.272
Wait.
Let-- let us guess.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.007
Jackie, what do you think
Art does for a living?

14:34.041 --> 14:34.908
I don't know.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.944
I couldn't-- test pilot?

14:36.977 --> 14:37.777
SWAT team?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.718
Thank you, uh, but
I'm an accountant.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.187
No way!

14:47.220 --> 14:48.088
Impossible!

14:51.658 --> 14:53.060
Wow.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.561
Well, why don't you
get up on this bike?

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
Let's check it out.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.998
Let's see what you
look like on there.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.266
Art.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.068
Oh.
ROSEANNE Oh, yeah.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.269
JACKIE: Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.103
BOTH: Yeah.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.640
You know something, Art?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.276
What?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.377
Oh.
Never mind.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.211
I'm married.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.187
Let me tell you something
about this bike, Art.

15:20.220 --> 15:24.724
Not only does it deliver
900 CCs of raw power,

15:24.757 --> 15:26.326
but I mean, it's roomy.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.062
Oh, she's right there, Art.

15:29.096 --> 15:29.997
She is right.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.531
Look at that.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.701
Plenty of room.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.668
Come on.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.470
Guys, you'd say
just about anything

15:37.504 --> 15:38.705
to get me to buy a bike.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.872
Hey, now, you
wait a minute, Art.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.008
No, no, no.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.742
I sell three, four of
these things every day.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.046
I got no reason to lie to you.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.080
I'm just being honest with you.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.449
I'm just telling you,
this bike, it just

15:49.482 --> 15:51.484
looks like it was made for you.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.652
You know what I mean, Art?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.154
OK, picture it.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.122
You're going to work, right?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.923
You pull into that parking lot.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.026
You're totally surrounded by
all these accountant type car.

15:59.059 --> 15:59.926
JACKIE: Oh, yeah.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.028
You know?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.230
And you show up riding
one of these things?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.664
The engine's roaring.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.199
The tires are squealing.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.836
And your loins are vibrating
like a tuning fork.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.111
Uh, you're very good.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.512
Um, listen.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.116
I'm having a great time, and I
don't really want you to stop.

16:23.150 --> 16:28.521
But I-- I still don't
know if it's right for me.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.356
Oh, your choice.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.894
So think your wife's
dating anybody, Art?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.338
No way Jackie gets
the commission.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.473
I sold the bike.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.408
That's true, dear, but
you did use her as bait.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.476
Well, you smelled her, Dan.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.877
What would you use her as?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.512
Spread out, sprout.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.913
Let me see it again!

16:53.946 --> 16:54.781
[giggling]

16:55.782 --> 16:56.849
[giggling]

16:56.883 --> 16:58.085
Oh, man.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.586
This here's my favorite
check in the whole world.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.121
Oh, God, it is such
a rush, isn't it?

17:01.154 --> 17:02.255
Mm.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.124
I mean, I remember when
I first found that bike.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.526
It was just a rusted
out piece of junk.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.960
But I saw the potential.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.263
I took it back to the shop,
pounded out the dents.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.164
I re-chromed it.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.365
I repainted it.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.766
Boring, boring,
boring, boring, boring.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.936
Get to the part where I
smoked the guy into buying it.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.572
You were beautiful.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.407
Stop it.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.180
ROSEANNE So how's everything
going around here?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.981
Well, Mr. Mom up
there decided that I

17:29.015 --> 17:30.983
get to stay home and sit
for DJ while she goes out

17:31.017 --> 17:32.619
with Mark, the Cold Sore King.

17:35.922 --> 17:39.058
Well, at least
you're working it out.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.163
Darlene, do you know
where my car keys are?

17:43.196 --> 17:46.733
Why, yes, my fuhrer.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.834
Where?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.969
In a safe place.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.340
Oh, as safe as where
your science paper now is?

17:53.373 --> 17:54.807
Becky, that's due tomorrow.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.042
Oh.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.277
It's not even mine!

17:57.310 --> 17:58.111
Oh.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.882
We have to talk.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.451
- We definitely do, Darlene.
- Upstairs.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.285
Fine.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.494
You'll note they did not
bring the problem to me.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.528
Yes.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.231
Everything is going
according to plan.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.567
So my dear, would you
like a cup of coffee?

18:20.600 --> 18:21.501
Don't mind as I do.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.108
Hey, how's it going, champ?

18:29.142 --> 18:32.845
Your sisters make
sure you took a bath?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.382
No, they didn't, did they?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.116
Well, it's too late
to take one tonight.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.151
You can take it tomorrow.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.454
So go ahead and go
up to bed, honey.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.989
Goodnight, DJ.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.090
DAN: Goodnight, Deej.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.525
DJ.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.559
We say goodnight.

18:46.593 --> 18:50.463
You say goodnight.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.698
Hey, are you mad at us?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.267
How come you're not talking?

18:54.301 --> 18:56.836
I haven't said
anything in two days.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.338
Nobody's cared.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.406
That's not possible.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.407
Uh-huh.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.343
The last thing I
said was, "Cheerios."

19:06.112 --> 19:08.548
Deej, we've been real busy.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.116
You know, Daddy and
me are working real hard

19:10.149 --> 19:13.019
to start this new business,
and I guess we've just been

19:13.052 --> 19:14.721
too busy to notice, you know.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.425
But boy, we've been thinking
about you the whole time.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.326
OK?

19:19.359 --> 19:22.262
OK.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.131
Hold on, DJ.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.366
Forget everything I just said.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.100
We're so sorry, honey.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.970
Yeah, we're really sorry.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.071
Listen.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.207
You go up and brush your
teeth and get in bed

19:34.241 --> 19:37.744
and me and Daddy'll come
up and read you a story.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.313
Any story?
Even a long one?

19:40.347 --> 19:43.816
Yeah, even one we already
read a hundred times.

19:43.850 --> 19:44.717
OK.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.618
OK.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.187
We'll be up in a minute.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.323
Ouch.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.691
I really screwed up.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.593
But I'll be home a lot more now.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.329
Yeah, he can hang out with
me at the shop sometimes.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.230
Yeah.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.499
He'll like that.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.167
You still want any coffee?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.735
Nah, I'm too beat.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.670
Yeah.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.571
Let's go to bed.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.483
DAN: Oh, my God.

20:16.516 --> 20:20.420
I can't believe we
forgot about him again.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.089
Boy, he better learn how to
bitch and moan like his sisters

20:23.122 --> 20:24.691
or he ain't going to
make it in this family.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.798
How come you're
not at the mall?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.133
Oh, I'm on a break.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.802
You came all
the way down here?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.337
That's some long break.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.006
In 10 minutes,
it'll be a whole day.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.909
I'm just not cut out for
that squirt business.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.278
Look at these magazines.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.646
Yeah, I don't
read them, myself.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.316
I just buy them for the
pictures of naked women.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.919

not in right now, Mom.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.098
Yeah, hi.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.800
It's me.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.235
Oh, I'm OK.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.136
How you doing?

21:10.169 --> 21:14.106
Oh, my God.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.477
No, I'm not seeing
anybody else yet.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.545
Listen.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.348
Hey, Mom, uh, the
other line is ringing,

21:21.381 --> 21:24.050
so I'm just going to put you on
hold just for one second, OK?

21:24.083 --> 21:24.951
OK.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.018
Hang on.
