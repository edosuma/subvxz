WEBVTT

00:04.693 --> 00:06.050
Hey, Baxter.

00:06.052 --> 00:08.344
Working hard or hardly working?

00:08.346 --> 00:09.554
Go back to:

00:09.556 --> 00:11.982
"Whazzup!"

00:11.984 --> 00:13.400
You know, I was going through

00:13.402 --> 00:15.918
the company manual
looking for reasons why...

00:15.920 --> 00:17.562
why Joe would be up here.

00:17.564 --> 00:19.314
Yep, nah, nothing there.

00:19.316 --> 00:22.200
I'm sure there's prob...
No, nothing there, either.

00:22.202 --> 00:24.135
Should I go through all the...

00:24.137 --> 00:25.945
Nothing in... Oh, wait
a minute, there it is.

00:25.947 --> 00:28.840
Oh. Yeah. Joe should
never be up in the office.

00:29.868 --> 00:32.335
It doesn't say that.

00:32.337 --> 00:35.154
Oh, oh, oh, there she is!

00:35.156 --> 00:36.247
Lay it on me.

00:36.249 --> 00:39.000
What's the theme for the
chili contest this year?

00:39.002 --> 00:41.228
Why did I take the stairs?

00:41.230 --> 00:44.380
You know, when she's older,
I'm gonna have her piggyback me

00:44.382 --> 00:47.091
for nine months... ha...
see how she likes it.

00:47.093 --> 00:49.226
All due respect,

00:49.228 --> 00:51.405
she's not due for another few weeks.

00:51.407 --> 00:53.389
The chili contest is now.

00:53.391 --> 00:54.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:54.934 --> 00:56.994
You'll have to let it go. He's a novice.

00:56.996 --> 00:59.070
He hasn't won it four times, you know?

00:59.072 --> 01:00.414
When you win it that many times,

01:00.416 --> 01:04.191
you realize the contest
actually... comes to you.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.861
He may be a novice, but as I recall...

01:06.863 --> 01:09.781
Chuck won the Golden Apron last year.

01:09.783 --> 01:12.116
Wait a minute, Joe.

01:12.118 --> 01:14.844
If I won last year,

01:14.846 --> 01:17.697
why-why, that would
mean that Baxter lost.

01:17.699 --> 01:18.748
Oh-ho-ho!

01:18.750 --> 01:20.241
Which is something

01:20.243 --> 01:22.560
he's gonna have to live with
for the rest of his life.

01:22.562 --> 01:23.920
Yeah? Yeah?

01:23.922 --> 01:26.064
Those judges all reeked of bourbon.

01:27.192 --> 01:28.850
Everybody thought that your chili

01:28.852 --> 01:31.695
tasted like bad meat
just drenched in ketchup.

01:32.689 --> 01:34.222
Sorry.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.548
Okay. Okay.

01:35.550 --> 01:38.910
Uh, the twist for this year is:

01:38.912 --> 01:42.684
all of the chili needs
to be Asian-influenced.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.191
- Oh.
- I love these twists.

01:45.193 --> 01:48.427
Ah. When I won my, uh,
second... or was it third?...

01:48.429 --> 01:50.029
maybe the fourth time I won,

01:50.031 --> 01:52.123
we had to use pork shoulder.

01:52.125 --> 01:55.451
So my kitchen just
had that delicate aroma

01:55.453 --> 01:59.214
of boiled tomatoes
and pulled pork shank.

02:10.634 --> 02:12.760
Hey, Jen. What are you up to?

02:12.762 --> 02:16.055
Uh, studying for my AP History exam.

02:16.057 --> 02:17.997
Boy, that Genghis Khan,

02:17.999 --> 02:19.841
- what a Grumpy Gus.
- Yeah.

02:20.854 --> 02:22.579
And a Pillaging Pete.

02:23.557 --> 02:25.116
Well, I'm sure you'll do well.

02:25.118 --> 02:28.377
You actually excel at
anything you put your mind to.

02:29.538 --> 02:30.921
What do you want?

02:32.699 --> 02:35.828
Chili cook-off is coming
up, and it's an Asian theme.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.243
And I was thinking...

02:37.245 --> 02:39.120
remember the other night
you gave us that Chinese dish

02:39.122 --> 02:40.921
with that unbelievably good smoked pork?

02:40.923 --> 02:42.974
I wonder if you could just
give me the recipe for that?

02:42.976 --> 02:44.834
You mean my family's recipe

02:44.836 --> 02:47.187
that we've kept secret for 200 years?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.691
Give it to me.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.426
Interesting.

02:53.428 --> 02:55.404
You need some information

02:55.406 --> 02:59.116
and I happen to have said information.

03:03.062 --> 03:05.438
Maybe we could come up with a...

03:05.440 --> 03:07.607
mutually beneficial transaction?

03:07.609 --> 03:09.150
A little, uh...

03:09.152 --> 03:11.920
quid pro ro, if you will.

03:13.364 --> 03:14.756
Ro is Chinese for meat.

03:16.918 --> 03:18.565
I wonder what Chinese is

03:18.567 --> 03:21.087
for "get your feet off the damn table".

03:21.089 --> 03:25.398
Okay, the National Spelling
Bee is on this whole week,

03:25.400 --> 03:28.169
and I need to record
it on your DVR. Deal?

03:28.171 --> 03:30.671
Quid pro no.

03:30.673 --> 03:33.424
I just have the one DVR, and it's full.

03:33.426 --> 03:36.243
Full of old stuff. Who
the heck is Matlock,

03:36.245 --> 03:38.980
and why do you need 20 hours of him?

03:38.982 --> 03:42.308
He's the best country lawyer ever,

03:42.310 --> 03:45.871
and he's dead, and they're
not making any more like him.

03:45.873 --> 03:47.146
Well...

03:47.148 --> 03:49.816
good luck in your...

03:49.818 --> 03:52.294
Tournament of Meat, or whatever.

03:54.489 --> 03:57.332
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

03:57.334 --> 03:59.919
Goodbye, Matlock.

03:59.921 --> 04:01.777
Nobody looked better

04:01.779 --> 04:04.473
in a seersucker powder
blue suit than you.

04:06.295 --> 04:08.476
_

04:08.478 --> 04:10.617
I don't know what it is about tapas,

04:10.619 --> 04:13.464
but it is the only thing this
baby doesn't toss back up.

04:13.466 --> 04:15.827
Well, that is because it's delicious.

04:15.829 --> 04:18.486
Or, as they would thay in Barthelona,

04:18.488 --> 04:19.846
delith-ioth.

04:19.848 --> 04:23.057
Mom, that accent is
so good I can feel it.

04:23.059 --> 04:24.818
I'm sorry.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.436
You know, I just... I just
love our weekly get-togethers.

04:27.438 --> 04:29.289
You know, what we need is more...

04:29.291 --> 04:30.749
thangria.

04:32.986 --> 04:35.575
- Mom's the best.
- She's the greatest.

04:35.577 --> 04:37.506
We have to stop these weekly lunches.

04:37.508 --> 04:40.567
I know. I mean, I love
Mom's sangria dance

04:40.569 --> 04:42.967
as much as anyone else, but every week?

04:42.969 --> 04:44.770
I'm swamped with work right now.

04:44.772 --> 04:47.164
Me too. And I'm pregnant.
I should be spending

04:47.166 --> 04:50.126
all of my free time in a bathtub.

04:50.128 --> 04:51.510
So, wait, what are we gonna do?

04:51.512 --> 04:52.612
I have an idea.

04:52.614 --> 04:54.097
- Uh, just play along.
- No, no. But I don't know

04:54.099 --> 04:55.390
what you're doing...
I'm not good at this.

04:55.392 --> 04:57.767
Guys, guys, guys, uh, is it me,

04:57.769 --> 05:00.862
or does our waiter look
just like Antonio Banderas?

05:01.857 --> 05:05.099
It's the sangria goggles. Mm.

05:05.101 --> 05:07.151
Uh, hey, Mom, Mandy
and I were just talking

05:07.153 --> 05:09.353
- about how much we love these weekly lunches.
- Oh...

05:09.355 --> 05:11.791
She was talking.
I was just playing along.

05:11.793 --> 05:13.157
But, uh...

05:13.159 --> 05:16.068
... sadly, there are two
people who feel left out.

05:16.070 --> 05:17.111
Really? Who?

05:17.113 --> 05:18.321
Ryan and Kyle.

05:18.323 --> 05:19.956
- Hmm.
- They really miss seeing you.

05:19.958 --> 05:22.375
I-I bet they would love to
have lunch with you, too.

05:22.377 --> 05:25.119
Yes. That's it. I love this now.

05:25.121 --> 05:27.955
Well, that is... That
is really sweet, Kris.

05:27.957 --> 05:30.082
Why don't you guys bring
'em along next time?

05:30.084 --> 05:32.043
- No.
- What she means is,

05:32.045 --> 05:33.836
uh, no...

05:33.838 --> 05:36.672
they should have you all to themselves.

05:36.674 --> 05:40.235
That's what I mean 100%.

05:40.237 --> 05:43.313
Oh, I see. Um, okay.

05:43.315 --> 05:46.504
Well, you know, next time
it'll just be me and the boys.

05:46.506 --> 05:47.609
Cool.

05:47.611 --> 05:51.362
Oh, grathiath, Antonio.

05:54.004 --> 05:55.542
♪ Sangria! ♪

06:00.073 --> 06:02.573
Get 'em while they're
hot. And they are hot.

06:02.575 --> 06:05.743
I like to call this Baxter's
Chili Chili Bang Bang.

06:05.745 --> 06:07.827
Hmm. All right.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.163
- Here we go. Thank you.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh!

06:09.165 --> 06:10.423
Just one per customer,

06:10.425 --> 06:12.166
just enough to haunt you in your dreams,

06:12.168 --> 06:13.968
- get you begging for more.
- Okay.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.061
Just settle down, Mike.

06:16.063 --> 06:18.726
This is chili, not
Sophia Loren, all right?

06:18.728 --> 06:21.017
For God's sake. Huh,
what's the big deal?

06:21.019 --> 06:23.636
It's just... just a...

06:23.638 --> 06:25.179
Damn!

06:25.181 --> 06:26.689
Oh-ho-hoo!

06:26.691 --> 06:29.934
This is Sophia Loren
and Gina Lollobrigida.

06:29.936 --> 06:31.936
Yes, sir. Mmm.

06:31.938 --> 06:35.439
All swirled together in one tiny cup.

06:35.441 --> 06:37.441
Oh, boy, that's good. Boy, that's good.

06:37.443 --> 06:39.586
But it's more...

06:39.588 --> 06:41.546
Margaret Thatcher and Madame Curie.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.658
I like 'em tough and brainy, you know?

06:45.660 --> 06:48.494
What are you up to with
these samples, Baxter?

06:48.496 --> 06:49.745
Well, I made too much last night.

06:49.747 --> 06:51.239
I wasn't gonna throw it out.

06:51.241 --> 06:54.208
I mean, would Michelangelo
toss it away if he sculpted

06:54.210 --> 06:56.210
too much David?

06:56.212 --> 06:58.421
I've seen that statue, Mikey.

06:58.423 --> 07:01.890
Believe me, he did not sculpt too much.

07:01.892 --> 07:03.092
- Give it a shot.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.094 --> 07:04.116
See what it tastes like

07:04.118 --> 07:05.344
when you don't get your recipe

07:05.346 --> 07:06.721
off the back of a ketchup bottle.

07:06.723 --> 07:08.389
Hey, hey, don't knock ketchup.

07:08.391 --> 07:11.368
In a pinch, it makes a great hair gel.

07:12.603 --> 07:15.229
You know what I say about this, Baxter?

07:15.231 --> 07:16.447
Here it comes.

07:16.449 --> 07:19.358
- It's fantastic!
- Yeah.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.373
What? Don't mock me with your praise.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.578
I will not be praise-mocked.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.872
No, no... no, no, I'm
serious. This time, you...

07:24.874 --> 07:27.908
you really brought your A game.

07:27.910 --> 07:30.411
Yeah. The only thing that would
make this more delicious is

07:30.413 --> 07:32.666
- watching you go down in flames.
- Mm.

07:32.668 --> 07:35.066
Unfortunately, that is not gonna happen.

07:35.068 --> 07:36.810
- Oh, yeah, I think it will.
- Because I'm dropping out.

07:36.812 --> 07:38.228
Oh, yeah. What?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.757
This chili made you drop out?

07:43.634 --> 07:46.486
I should send this to Bernie Sanders.

07:52.351 --> 07:54.769
What do you mean you're
dropping out? You can't quit.

07:54.771 --> 07:57.472
I'm not. I'm retiring as champion.

07:57.474 --> 07:58.579
- Wh-what?
- And to tell you the truth,

07:58.581 --> 08:00.274
I only stayed in this long to, you know,

08:00.276 --> 08:02.068
motivate you to raise your game.

08:02.070 --> 08:05.193
You know what you remind
me of is old canned chili.

08:05.195 --> 08:07.007
Gassy and full of beans.

08:07.009 --> 08:09.241
- Hey, you got to admit, Baxter, it worked.
- What?

08:09.243 --> 08:11.419
Last year's chili was... meh.

08:11.421 --> 08:13.763
But this is meh-nificent.

08:16.949 --> 08:18.796
The only reason you're dropping out

08:18.798 --> 08:20.252
is you don't think you can beat me.

08:20.254 --> 08:21.420
You know... you know,

08:21.422 --> 08:23.005
you're what I would never put in chili.

08:23.007 --> 08:25.066
- Hmm?
- Chicken.

08:25.068 --> 08:27.694
Why are you so upset?

08:27.696 --> 08:29.970
With me out, you're a slam dunk to win.

08:29.972 --> 08:32.538
You kn-you know... you
remember when Frazier quit?

08:32.539 --> 08:35.433
Ali only had to fight Trevor Berbick.

08:35.436 --> 08:36.977
Who cares if you beat a dude

08:36.979 --> 08:39.855
named Trevor?

08:39.857 --> 08:42.491
- I don't care what you say, I'm done.
- No, you're not done.

08:42.494 --> 08:44.584
- No, no, no. And unlike the champ...
- No, no, no.

08:44.586 --> 08:45.876
... I'm going out on top.

08:45.878 --> 08:47.571
I don't buy it. You're not a quitter.

08:47.573 --> 08:49.031
He's not a quitter. He doesn't quit.

08:49.033 --> 08:51.867
Except golf. He should quit that.

08:51.869 --> 08:54.453
Hey, I-I got a question.

08:54.455 --> 08:56.172
If it's hot...

08:56.174 --> 08:59.291
why do they call it chili?

08:59.293 --> 09:03.045
You're a deep thinker, Joe.

09:03.047 --> 09:05.397
Probably why you're such
good friends with Chuck.

09:05.399 --> 09:06.572
Oh, yeah, we're really close.

09:06.574 --> 09:09.630
In fact, he doesn't know it,
but he's godfather to my cats.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.210
That's why I'm gonna
have you do something

09:12.212 --> 09:13.305
no one would suspect.

09:13.307 --> 09:15.775
I'm gonna have you
gather some intelligence.

09:15.777 --> 09:18.111
Okay.

09:18.113 --> 09:21.581
And while you're at it,
gather some for yourself.

09:27.015 --> 09:28.454
- This place is great.
- Yeah.

09:28.456 --> 09:29.864
And the gazpacho was,

09:29.866 --> 09:31.657
to quote my favorite mother-in-law,

09:31.659 --> 09:34.160
"delith-ioth".

09:34.162 --> 09:36.846
Well, I am glad you enjoyed it.

09:36.848 --> 09:39.048
You know, what a great
idea the girls had, huh?

09:39.050 --> 09:42.018
Yeah. Turns out I love
tapas. I'm so relieved.

09:42.020 --> 09:44.187
I thought Mandy said, "Mom
wants to take you and Ryan

09:44.189 --> 09:46.523
to a... topless bar".

09:48.139 --> 09:49.981
And yet you showed up.

09:56.785 --> 10:00.769
So, Ryan... talk.

10:00.771 --> 10:03.606
Uh, well, it is really nice
getting out of the house.

10:03.608 --> 10:06.200
- Kris has been a little...
- Oh, hey, dude,

10:06.202 --> 10:08.535
it's not polite to complain
about your wife

10:08.537 --> 10:09.653
to her mother.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.488
Have you even read Emily Post?

10:11.490 --> 10:13.324
No, no, no, no, no. That's okay, Kyle.

10:13.326 --> 10:14.834
Look, I raised Kristin,

10:14.836 --> 10:16.702
so I know exactly what
Ryan's dealing with.

10:16.704 --> 10:18.424
You-you dish, girlfriend.

10:19.757 --> 10:23.334
Okay, it's just... the
mornings are particularly hard.

10:23.336 --> 10:24.769
You know, Kris can be just...

10:24.771 --> 10:26.003
- A total monster? Yeah, yeah.
- Yes.

10:26.005 --> 10:28.306
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She needs an hour

10:28.308 --> 10:30.108
before she becomes a human being again.

10:30.110 --> 10:31.601
- Yes.
- I know.

10:31.603 --> 10:33.144
I finally feel heard.

10:33.146 --> 10:35.261
You know, Mike and I used
to have a nickname for her

10:35.263 --> 10:36.323
when she was a girl.

10:36.325 --> 10:38.482
We called her "Partly Cloudy".

10:43.924 --> 10:45.697
Why?

10:45.699 --> 10:49.265
Well, because it would take
forever for the sun to come out.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.444
Oh.

10:50.446 --> 10:52.920
- Yeah.
- Oh, Emily Post is wrong.

10:52.922 --> 10:54.716
Gossiping is a hoot.

10:54.718 --> 10:56.283
Do Mandy now.

10:56.285 --> 10:57.618
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.828
Ah, ooh. But first...

10:59.830 --> 11:02.640
♪ Sangria! ♪

11:06.003 --> 11:09.089
Greetings, my good sir.

11:09.091 --> 11:11.698
What's with the old-timey talk?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.723
Oh, it's just something
I'm experimenting with.

11:13.725 --> 11:17.012
I always felt I was meant
to live in a bygone era.

11:17.014 --> 11:20.283
Probably, 'cause you sure
weren't meant for this one.

11:21.661 --> 11:23.912
Hey, be nice to me. I got your intel.

11:23.914 --> 11:26.789
Or as the French call it, "information".

11:28.609 --> 11:31.341
No, they don't.

11:31.343 --> 11:33.783
So, what's going on? I-I suspect

11:33.785 --> 11:35.882
he's working on a secret
recipe. Is that what it is?

11:35.884 --> 11:37.992
No. No, he's definitely out
of it. I've confirmed it.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.645
Well, what's he doing?

11:39.647 --> 11:42.450
Look, I don't want to betray
Chuck's confidence, okay?

11:42.452 --> 11:45.335
I mean, who's gonna take
care of my cats when I'm gone?

11:45.337 --> 11:47.677
Joe, they're cats.

11:47.679 --> 11:50.227
They're all just counting
the minutes until we die.

11:50.229 --> 11:52.690
Spill it.

11:52.692 --> 11:56.264
Okay, okay. A couple of months
ago, Chuck had an angioplasty.

11:56.266 --> 11:58.297
Really?

11:58.299 --> 12:00.113
Well, why didn't he say that?

12:00.115 --> 12:03.159
Oh, I don't know. Why do
you think, Mr. "Bwok-bwok"?

12:03.161 --> 12:05.978
Luckily, it was just a partial blockage,

12:05.980 --> 12:07.446
and he's just gonna change his diet.

12:07.448 --> 12:11.358
So certainly no more of
his great double-meat chili

12:11.360 --> 12:13.544
with all that bacon and
nacho cheese in it, huh?

12:13.546 --> 12:16.405
Apparently. I guess
that's bad for you, huh?

12:16.407 --> 12:18.073
Oh, it's bad for you.

12:18.075 --> 12:19.366
You know how I know?

12:19.368 --> 12:21.627
'Cause it's delicious.

12:21.629 --> 12:23.537
You know, his dad died of heart disease.

12:23.539 --> 12:25.706
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.963
But, hey, Chuck's making
some changes to his lifestyle.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.150
He's gonna live a healthier life.

12:33.099 --> 12:35.132
You look a little nauseous.

12:35.134 --> 12:36.759
It's not nausea.

12:36.761 --> 12:38.844
It's-it's... it's worse.

12:38.846 --> 12:41.281
It's... empathy.

12:48.314 --> 12:50.939
So Chuck didn't say anything
to you about this heart problem?

12:50.941 --> 12:53.376
Yeah, well, to be honest,
I'm not quite sure.

12:53.378 --> 12:55.586
You know, my hearing's not
as good as it used to be.

12:55.588 --> 12:59.081
I just hope if he did, I
didn't say, "Great story!" Yeah.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.881
Hey, we having a drink
before we head home?

13:01.883 --> 13:03.574
Yeah, we were just talking
about it. Do you want, uh,

13:03.576 --> 13:06.094
some carrot juice or just the
hot water with lemon in it?

13:06.096 --> 13:09.467
Oh. Joe told you?

13:09.469 --> 13:12.503
Yeah. Damn it, when were
you gonna say something?

13:12.505 --> 13:13.969
I was just waiting for a time

13:13.971 --> 13:16.465
when I was in the mood
to be savagely mocked.

13:16.467 --> 13:19.444
Really? You think I'd make
fun of something this serious?

13:21.138 --> 13:22.721
Right. Right.

13:22.723 --> 13:24.723
This isn't like my golf game

13:24.725 --> 13:26.887
or my turtleneck sweaters

13:26.889 --> 13:28.811
or the hundred other
things you ride me about.

13:28.813 --> 13:31.814
This is about mortality,
Mike. This is about

13:31.816 --> 13:34.733
me coming to grips with
the idea that I could die.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.502
Great story!

13:37.571 --> 13:40.781
Ed, lean in a little closer.

13:40.783 --> 13:44.304
So after the procedure,
are you okay now?

13:44.306 --> 13:46.328
Oh, yeah, and I plan
on staying that way.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.831
I'm eating better, getting
exercise. I feel great.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.165
Good for you.

13:50.167 --> 13:52.292
Who cares if anyone mocks you?

13:52.294 --> 13:55.638
Yeah, you know, three nights
a week, Bonnie and I go vegan.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.192
So three nights a week,
you don't eat anything?

14:00.219 --> 14:02.143
What about you, Baxter?

14:02.145 --> 14:04.515
What are you doing to-to
fend off the Grim Reaper?

14:04.517 --> 14:06.849
I don't think of death
as the Grim Reaper.

14:06.851 --> 14:09.535
I think of death as a for-sure
way of keeping me from dancing.

14:10.604 --> 14:12.330
Come on, Mikey.

14:12.332 --> 14:14.565
Chuck and I are opening
up. Show us you're human.

14:14.567 --> 14:16.334
Okay. Get this.

14:16.336 --> 14:19.173
- I've started meditating.
- Oh.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.113
Mike Baxter meditates!

14:23.167 --> 14:26.135
He also owns a gun store.

14:26.137 --> 14:28.328
Okay.

14:28.330 --> 14:29.963
Why can't you still be in the contest

14:29.965 --> 14:31.564
and just not eat that stuff?

14:31.566 --> 14:34.751
No way, man. When I started
making my test batch, it hit me.

14:34.753 --> 14:37.653
This does not fit into my new lifestyle.

14:37.655 --> 14:38.797
I wish it could.

14:38.799 --> 14:41.216
You know, there are plenty
of vegan chili recipes. Yeah.

14:41.218 --> 14:43.469
Yeah. Bonnie just made
one the other night.

14:43.471 --> 14:44.979
Our dog loved it.

14:46.671 --> 14:48.652
You can't make a healthy chili

14:48.654 --> 14:51.339
that can compete with the
kind that will kill you.

14:52.914 --> 14:55.022
You can't.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.607
What are you saying, Baxter?

14:56.609 --> 14:58.188
I'm saying, the next best thing

14:58.190 --> 15:00.128
to whipping your butt in a competition

15:00.130 --> 15:03.464
is dragging you with me
into the winner's circle.

15:06.452 --> 15:09.328
Oh. Hey, it's my girls.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.121
What a nice surprise.

15:11.123 --> 15:13.499
Oh, this beautiful day just got better.

15:13.501 --> 15:16.084
Really, Mom? Is it a beautiful day?

15:16.086 --> 15:17.903
You sure it's not partly cloudy?

15:20.674 --> 15:23.234
Yeah, with a chance of
Princess Poopy Pants?

15:25.155 --> 15:28.055
Sorry, but my nickname
doesn't have a weather theme.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.382
I see. You are upset

15:30.384 --> 15:33.200
because I shared some childhood
nicknames with your husbands.

15:33.202 --> 15:35.365
Yeah. Nicknames that
probably should have stayed

15:35.367 --> 15:36.822
within the family, Mom.

15:36.824 --> 15:39.229
So Kyle and Ryan aren't family?

15:39.231 --> 15:42.870
No. They are just two
guys with strong genes

15:42.872 --> 15:44.872
we dragged home to
mate with. It's science.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.468
Yeah, they're in-laws.

15:48.470 --> 15:50.386
We're... laws.

15:51.789 --> 15:53.306
All right, well, I'm sorry.

15:53.308 --> 15:56.041
I will try to be less
gabby with your husbands

15:56.043 --> 15:58.019
the next time you both want to ditch me.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.804
What?

16:00.806 --> 16:04.341
Mom, no. God, we would never ditch you.

16:04.343 --> 16:07.456
Yeah, especially if we knew
we were gonna get caught.

16:07.458 --> 16:10.148
Look, Mom, I'm really sorry,

16:10.150 --> 16:11.713
but we're both really busy right now.

16:11.715 --> 16:13.058
Well, that's fine.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.102
You know what? You
could have just told me.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.145
We don't have to have lunch every week.

16:17.147 --> 16:18.560
You're not gonna hurt my feelings.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.940
We're all adults here.

16:19.942 --> 16:23.310
Even you, Princess Poopy Pants.

16:23.312 --> 16:26.895
Okay, well, in that case,
I-I can't do lunch next week,

16:26.897 --> 16:28.646
and the week after is iffy.

16:28.648 --> 16:31.451
Yeah, same. I'm just...
I'm really swamped.

16:31.453 --> 16:33.353
Okay. Okay. Well, you know what?

16:33.355 --> 16:35.652
Thanks for telling me. See?

16:35.654 --> 16:37.925
It didn't kill me.

16:37.927 --> 16:40.019
But... but I am wounded.

16:40.021 --> 16:42.713
Because, you know,

16:42.715 --> 16:45.340
I'm only the woman who...

16:45.342 --> 16:47.193
gave you both life.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.186
There she goes.

16:51.188 --> 16:53.372
Melodramatic Martha.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.730
- Hey.
- Uh.

16:59.732 --> 17:02.024
Sorry I'm late. I was watching TV.

17:02.026 --> 17:05.493
You were right. Matlock is great!

17:05.496 --> 17:07.720
"I'd sooner eat a live chicken

17:07.722 --> 17:09.740
than be your lawyer!"

17:09.742 --> 17:12.376
"The Debt", season seven.

17:12.377 --> 17:15.714
Is the contest over?

17:15.715 --> 17:16.757
- Who won?
- I don't know.

17:16.759 --> 17:18.965
Oh, uh, Kristin's, uh, tallying
up the votes right now,

17:18.968 --> 17:20.976
but to tell you the truth, I think

17:20.978 --> 17:23.337
Baxter and I have a pretty good
chance of winning this thing.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.179
- You're working together?
- Yeah.

17:25.181 --> 17:28.215
What the ding-dang-dog is going on here?

17:28.218 --> 17:31.341
- You've had enough Matlock.
- Yeah, it-it was actually

17:31.343 --> 17:33.096
- Baxter's idea for us to work together.
- Yeah.

17:33.098 --> 17:35.515
We came up with one
amazing batch, which we call

17:35.517 --> 17:37.976
- "Chili Chili Bwok Bwok".
- That's right.

17:37.978 --> 17:40.437
- Okay, everyone.
- All right.

17:40.439 --> 17:42.522
The results for the
chili contest are in,

17:42.524 --> 17:44.066
and the winner is...

17:44.068 --> 17:45.863
Oh, God, so much pork in the air.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.778
Uh...

17:47.780 --> 17:51.406
Joe Leonard and his Seven-Meat Chili.

17:51.408 --> 17:52.842
- Hey.
- What?

17:54.411 --> 17:55.761
Yeah.

17:55.763 --> 17:58.139
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.141 --> 18:00.290
Well, put my leg in a tea kettle.

18:00.292 --> 18:02.393
Justice has not been served.

18:03.754 --> 18:06.570
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

18:06.572 --> 18:10.064
If I won, that means you two lost,

18:10.066 --> 18:12.644
which is... something
you'll have to live with

18:12.646 --> 18:14.262
for the rest of your lives.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.640
How the hell did you win this?

18:16.642 --> 18:19.559
Yeah, the only thing you
know how to make is cat food.

18:19.561 --> 18:21.728
- And tell me that's not the seventh meat.
- No, no.

18:21.730 --> 18:24.481
I just wrote down all the
foods people shouldn't eat,

18:24.483 --> 18:25.958
and I put it in the pot.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.235
- What about the Asian theme?
- Yeah.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.363
I threw in some of my
old soy sauce packets.

18:31.365 --> 18:33.457
Uh, some of them from the '90s.

18:33.459 --> 18:36.802
The name "Chun King" ring a bell?

18:36.804 --> 18:38.954
Hold on, everyone.

18:38.956 --> 18:41.493
Uh, since I currently
find pork disgusting,

18:41.495 --> 18:45.168
I am offering a spot on the
menu for a healthier option.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.959
Congratulations, Mike
Baxter and Chuck Larabee.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.758
Hey. Yes!

18:51.760 --> 18:53.927
Now if you'll excuse
me, I need to go outside

18:53.929 --> 18:55.738
and vomit into a bush.

18:57.632 --> 18:59.229
Looks like we're both winners.

18:59.231 --> 19:00.540
Yeah, man.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.972
I know I say "not cool" a lot,

19:02.974 --> 19:04.813
but cool.

19:04.815 --> 19:06.540
- Thanks for doing this with me, Baxter.
- Yeah.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.067
I mean... you got a good heart.

19:09.069 --> 19:10.600
Nah. I got to be honest with you.

19:10.602 --> 19:13.418
I actually physically
do not have a heart.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.217
That's why I can eat
whatever I want to eat.

19:23.393 --> 19:25.653
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man,

19:25.655 --> 19:26.936
where we don't just sell gear.

19:26.938 --> 19:28.170
We sell a way of life.

19:28.172 --> 19:30.881
And you know the one thing
you need more than anything

19:30.883 --> 19:33.216
to enjoy our outdoor way of life?

19:33.218 --> 19:35.552
Life.

19:35.554 --> 19:37.596
Yep, if you're dead,

19:37.598 --> 19:40.107
you just won't appreciate all
the cool stuff we have to offer.

19:40.109 --> 19:42.151
Or the amazing discounts.

19:42.153 --> 19:43.594
The only good thing about death...

19:43.596 --> 19:46.288
you don't got to pay taxes.

19:46.290 --> 19:47.981
Well, I guess you actually do.

19:47.983 --> 19:49.383
There's the death tax, isn't there?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.695
Damn it. Some of the things
that make life worth living

19:53.697 --> 19:56.281
can actually make our lives
a little or a lot shorter.

19:56.283 --> 19:59.418
For each of these things, you
got to decide, is it worth it?

19:59.420 --> 20:01.606
Now, sure, riding a
motorcycle without a helmet

20:01.608 --> 20:03.163
is a lot more fun than
squeezing your nugget

20:03.165 --> 20:05.382
into a carbon fiber bucket.

20:05.384 --> 20:08.251
Full helmet like the Wild Hogs,

20:08.253 --> 20:09.739
or wind blowing through your hair,

20:09.741 --> 20:11.805
going full Captain America
in Easy Rider.

20:11.807 --> 20:14.612
Ooh. Good choice, but I like 'em both.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.578
But then, you split lanes,

20:16.580 --> 20:18.973
and the old lady in the
Oldsmobile Delta 88 decides

20:18.975 --> 20:20.555
to change lanes, too.

20:20.557 --> 20:22.048
You go over the handlebars.
You're thinking,

20:22.050 --> 20:24.401
"You know what would be fun
right now is that helmet!"

20:26.313 --> 20:28.822
You get older, you're forced
to give up more and more.

20:28.824 --> 20:30.824
Your doctor. Remember
those doctors you'd...

20:30.826 --> 20:33.735
- actually smoke with you?
- "You know, Bob..."

20:33.737 --> 20:36.988
"... you should give up
these lung darts. Wow".

20:36.990 --> 20:38.990
You roll out of bed one morning.

20:38.992 --> 20:42.503
Your knees tell you to retire
from the annual 5K race.

20:42.505 --> 20:45.824
And finally, finally,
they come for a man's grub.

20:45.826 --> 20:49.376
When did kale get a publicist?

20:49.378 --> 20:52.862
They come for our belly-busted
food, comfort food.

20:52.864 --> 20:54.728
The German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche said,

20:54.730 --> 20:56.216
"Time is a flat circle".

20:56.218 --> 20:58.569
He believed time was an
endless loop like this,

20:58.571 --> 21:00.762
a repetition.

21:00.764 --> 21:04.408
Freddy, as I like to
call him, died at 55.

21:04.410 --> 21:07.152
So it didn't repeat very
long, did it, Friedrich, huh?

21:07.154 --> 21:09.152
Probably wished that
circle was a little wider,

21:09.154 --> 21:11.742
included one last bratwurst
and sausage, right?

21:11.744 --> 21:14.485
All the stuff we give
up as we get older,

21:14.487 --> 21:15.982
there's one thing
we're never quite ready

21:15.984 --> 21:17.696
to part with is our friends.

21:17.698 --> 21:19.656
Studies show the more
time you spend with them

21:19.658 --> 21:22.218
being active in the outdoors,
the longer they'll live.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.962
And if you have a friend
who rides a motorcycle,

21:24.964 --> 21:27.139
buy him a helmet.

21:27.141 --> 21:29.875
We'd hate for you to lose a friend,

21:29.877 --> 21:31.560
or for me to lose a customer.

21:33.088 --> 21:35.147
Take care of yourselves. Baxter out.
