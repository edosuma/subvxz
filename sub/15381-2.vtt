01:06.600 --> 01:08.810
Come on, Hallie.
Wait up!

01:08.970 --> 01:11.230
I'm Catching up.

02:01.730 --> 02:05.030
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.660
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.410
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.910
He restoreth my soul.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.790
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

02:17.960 --> 02:21.550
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

02:21.710 --> 02:24.920
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

02:25.090 --> 02:27.340
My cup runneth over.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.890
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life...

02:32.060 --> 02:37.390
and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.760
Amen."

03:19.520 --> 03:21.400
May I have your attention,
please?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.980
Midrail announces the boarding
of train 417, the Wisconsin Badger...

03:26.150 --> 03:28.950
scheduled to depart
at 5.'45...

03:29.110 --> 03:31.870
now receiving passengers
on Track S.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.000
Isn't she beautiful, huh?

03:40.830 --> 03:42.880
Nice camera work, Dad.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.880
Don't call us.

03:53.010 --> 03:57.270
They said the kids are going to fill up
this car, but the last one is still empty.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.230
Thank you.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.490
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
- Bye. Bye now.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.900
Thanks for the ride.

04:50.070 --> 04:53.610
I can't tell you how much
I enjoyed meeting you.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.330
The pleasure was all mine.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.410
Peter!

05:05.460 --> 05:08.000
You never did autograph
your book.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.520
Take care.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.830
- Hey, Peter, how's it goin"?
- Hey!

05:44.820 --> 05:45.820
He's here.
Gotta go.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.040
- Hi, Peter.
- Hello.

05:48.210 --> 05:50.130
Hey, Brackett!

05:51.170 --> 05:53.170
- Hey, Peter.
- Hello.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.680
- Hey, stranger!
- Hey, Jay.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.100
- He was due here a half hour ago.
- Oh, no!

05:59.260 --> 06:01.680
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Please, be patient.

06:01.850 --> 06:06.310
- Damn!
- He'll be here. Wait, wait.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.560
Peter Brackett's office.

06:07.730 --> 06:10.190
Who are all those people
in Peter Brackett's office?

06:10.360 --> 06:12.190
I can't wait around
all morning.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.320
Your publicist. A guy with a gripe
from Alderman Cvack's office.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.620
A jockey.
You're buying a race horse?

06:18.780 --> 06:20.950
Do you know that your column's
due in nine minutes?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.500
- This could be a record, even for you.
- I know, I know. Just tell...

06:23.660 --> 06:26.620
- I want to talk to him. Give me the phone.
- Just tell the jockey that I'm gonna talk...

06:26.790 --> 06:30.460
Peter, it's me. Listen, honey. I can't keep
setting up these prestigious book signings...

06:30.630 --> 06:32.960
if you're gonna disappear
five minutes into the affair.

06:33.130 --> 06:36.170
And who'd you disappear with, anyway? The
blonde with the legs up the kazoo or the...

06:36.340 --> 06:38.640
Lindy, just give me a little credit. I got
food poisoning from the hors d'oeuvres.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.970
- I'm in bed. I can barely speak.
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.970
Brackett, you're killing me.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.850
It's written.
I swear you'll have it in three minutes.

06:47.020 --> 06:50.110
You tell him we're gonna stop by later,
all right? Can you believe this guy?

06:50.270 --> 06:52.820
Brilliant, charming,
undependable.

07:00.740 --> 07:03.330
"Shopping Center Shootout
Leaves One Teen Dead."

07:03.490 --> 07:06.160
- Jeannie, didn't I once do a column about...
- July '85.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.660
Scroll that.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.180
Let's get down to
"Johnny Got A Gun."

07:23.430 --> 07:25.220
Okay, "Johnny Got A Gun."

07:37.940 --> 07:39.650
This works, this works.

07:41.910 --> 07:46.700
Just brilliant. You're brilliant,
Brackett. Just brilliant.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.510
Matt, we got a bullet.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.140
- Where's Shapiro? Shapiro!
- She left.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.810
- Where's Knobloch?
- Covering a fire in Winnetka.

08:10.980 --> 08:13.310
Another minute, you would've missed
the syndicate. Where's Jake?

08:13.480 --> 08:15.190
Went home with a 103 fever,
Mr. Greenfield.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.070
- Suzie!
- Right here.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.650
Get me Varney at home, or Kovler.
He lives out that way.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.030
I'm going to a dinner party.
Do you have the address?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.910
Right here. Cocktails at 7:00. Dinner
at 8:00. Also don't forget tomorrow.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.690
Good Day, Chicago. You're the
first guest, so don't be late.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.150
Varney's wife is having a baby.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.710
Kovler is not home,
and Jake's temperature's up to 104.

08:41.130 --> 08:44.800
Don't give me that hound dog look.
I don't cover the beat anymore.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.310
And I don't print
recycled columns.

08:47.470 --> 08:50.020
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Now, are you actually accusing me...

08:50.180 --> 08:51.980
- of plagiarizing myself?
- Suzie!

08:52.140 --> 08:54.600
Pull up Brackett's columns
from the mid-'80s.

08:54.770 --> 08:56.900
Something with "gun"
in the title.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.990
"Guns Of Something."
"Gun Shy." "Son Of A Gun."

09:01.150 --> 09:05.320
"Johnny Got A Gun." That's it.
Uh-huh. I'm right. He knows it.

09:59.290 --> 10:02.550
Who's that with the groom?
Is that Peter Brackett?

10:02.710 --> 10:04.470
Oh, man. What's goin' on here?

10:04.630 --> 10:07.550
He's the last person
we need talkin' to our only eyewitness.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.300
- I don't know how Brackett got to him, sir.
- All right.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.560
- Let's just pull the kid outta there, please.
- Okay.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.520
Then what happened
after everything jolted?

10:15.690 --> 10:17.940
I was knocked down and...

10:18.100 --> 10:19.810
when I got up, Amy's car
was loose. It was...

10:19.980 --> 10:24.780
- Who's Peter Brackett got?
- It was like it was flyin'.

10:24.950 --> 10:28.030
- It was just gone.
- Let's get you outta here, kid.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.780
- Okay, Brackett.
- Better put this kid on ice

10:29.950 --> 10:30.990
if you want him in one piece.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.120
All right, that's it, folks.
Give us some room.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.370
If we could just have
a full name, sir.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.460
Anything that we can start?
We need some details here, if we could.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.890
Andy, Andy. Who's that?

11:38.060 --> 11:39.690
- What, at the police car?
- Yeah.

11:39.850 --> 11:41.810
You're the third guy
to ask me about her. Uh...

11:41.980 --> 11:45.400
I've never seen her before, but I hear
she's working for the Globe.

12:12.220 --> 12:15.560
Come on, come on!
Grab the Walkie-talkie.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.530
Let's go!

12:26.690 --> 12:29.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
at the present time...

12:29.190 --> 12:31.070
we're attempting to piece
together the chain of events...

12:31.240 --> 12:34.620
that led to the derailment
of Midrail's 417.

12:34.780 --> 12:39.580
From what we've been able to ascertain,
the last car uncoupled at 5:59 p.m.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.580
It traveled down this incline
where it overturned.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.040
There are five
known fatalities.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.340
They're not gonna
tell you that.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.090
Excuse me?

12:52.260 --> 12:55.300
Your question. Don't ask it. They're not
gonna tell you who serviced the train.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.760
- These cars are inspected on a daily basis.
- Really? Why is that?

12:57.930 --> 13:01.140
Because they want to talk to him
before you do!

13:01.310 --> 13:03.270
- It can't hurt to ask.
- No, no, no, no.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.820
It always hurts to ask questions
you know will piss 'em off.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.150
- Uh, yes, yes. The lady in the back.
- Sabrina Peterson from the Globe.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.150
Do you have the name of the individual
who last serviced the train?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.490
That information is not
available at this time.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.490
- Then could you tell us...
- Yes, Cynthia.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.830
First day on the job?

13:18.990 --> 13:22.290
- No, it's not my first day on the job.
- Huh? Second?

13:22.460 --> 13:25.170
Look, all I'm tryin' to say is that
if you'd been in town any longer...

13:25.330 --> 13:27.210
I'm sure we would've met.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.590
And had I seen you,
we would've.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.840
My name's Brackett. I work for the
Chronicle. Where're you from, Peterson?

13:36.010 --> 13:38.600
Look, I realize every
cub reporter in a skirt...

13:38.760 --> 13:41.730
must go ga-ga at the great
Peter Brackett approaching them...

13:41.890 --> 13:44.190
but I can't believe you're trying to hit
on me while I'm covering a story.

13:44.350 --> 13:49.440
So let me set you straight. You have zero
chance of scoring here. Trust me. Move on.

13:49.610 --> 13:52.280
I'm sorry. Where'd you say
you're from? Bitchville?

13:54.280 --> 13:55.740
All right,
last question, please.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.950
Yes, was there a data recorder
on the train? And if so...

13:58.120 --> 14:00.910
when will that tape
be made available?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.460
Hang in there, Peterson.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.500
Yes, there is a data recorder
on the train.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.000
Now, when it's gonna be available,
I can't say.

14:08.170 --> 14:10.550
How long before
the line will be open?

14:10.710 --> 14:12.880
Our inspectors are here now.
We'll have that for you shortly.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.800
- Found him.
- All right, thank you, folks.

14:14.970 --> 14:16.180
That's it. Thank you.

14:34.690 --> 14:36.360
- Ray Boggs?
- Uh, yes, sir.

14:36.530 --> 14:39.240
Uh, let's talk about what happened
tonight, Ray. Is this your wife?

14:39.410 --> 14:40.410
Uh, yes, yes. Yes it is.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.540
Well, uh, would you mind waiting here,
Mrs. Boggs?

14:42.700 --> 14:44.620
- We won't be long.
- Sure, I'll wait.

14:44.790 --> 14:46.790
Thank you.

14:58.550 --> 15:01.550
Sorry to bother you,
but I think I've got a scoop.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
Hey, bother me!
I can use it.

15:03.890 --> 15:06.100
Come in. Tell me
what have you got?

15:06.270 --> 15:08.600
A name. Ray Boggs.

15:08.770 --> 15:12.110
Midrail didn't want to say who was
responsible for checking the coupling...

15:12.270 --> 15:15.070
so I followed a couple of
Midrail guys back to the office.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.490
And there he was, Mr. Coupling himself,
waiting in the parking lot.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.910
They whisked him upstairs, but they
left his wife there for the taking.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.750
She told me her husband's name,
but then she clammed up on me.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.790
There was something about the way
she clammed up

15:27.960 --> 15:30.540
made me think
she had something more to say.

15:32.090 --> 15:35.260
By the way, Peter Brackett
was out there tonight.

15:36.340 --> 15:38.420
- You're kidding!
- Don't you worry.

15:38.590 --> 15:42.260
I own this story. Besides,
e little competition's healthy.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.030
Sabrina.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.730
Peter Brackett
is not competition.

15:47.890 --> 15:50.600
No, I was talking about me.

15:50.770 --> 15:54.860
The young groom returned to the last oar
of train 417 with champagne in hand...

15:55.020 --> 15:57.150
and saw his bride
for the last time. Period.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.610
Now quote: Amy's car was loose.
Period. It was like flyin'.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.320
Apostrophe after the Comma.

16:02.490 --> 16:06.290
And then it was just gone.
Period. End quote. End story.

16:06.450 --> 16:10.750
Huh? Yeah, I know it's thin, but Midrail
isn't talkin', so everyone's screwed.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.880
Yes! Everyone!
Yes, I'm sure.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.460
Jesus! Now I remember
why I became a columnist.

16:17.630 --> 16:21.300
Trust me. No one's gonna get anything else
because there's nothin' else to get.

16:21.470 --> 16:24.260
Mrs. Boggs, this is Sabrina
Peterson with the Chicago Globe.

16:24.430 --> 16:27.270
I'm sorry to call you so late,
but I was wondering if, by any chance...

16:27.430 --> 16:30.310
you're related to the Ray Boggs
that works for Midrail.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.690
- What's Midrail?
- The railroad.

16:32.850 --> 16:35.900
Come on, Ray, you've gotta be
related to somebody in this town.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.190
- Hello?
- Mr. Boggs, good evening, sir.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.360
This is Sabrina Peterson
with the Chicago Globe.

16:42.530 --> 16:46.240
- We already subscribe.
- Okay.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.540
- Hello?
- Mrs. Boggs, this is Sabrina Peterson...

16:48.700 --> 16:51.290
with the Chicago Globe.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.050
- Yes?
- Mrs. Boggs, yes, I think we got out off.

17:00.210 --> 17:01.470
How are you tonight?

17:01.630 --> 17:03.550
What do you want?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.550
I was wondering if you're
by any chance related

17:05.720 --> 17:07.810
to the Ray Boggs that works for Midrail.

17:07.970 --> 17:11.730
- I'm his mother.
- And, uh, yes, that's what I thought.

17:11.890 --> 17:14.940
And I wanted to know, uh, if you knew
about the train crash tonight.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.730
I saw it on the news.
I called Ray right away.

17:17.900 --> 17:22.740
You did. And, uh,
why is that, Mrs. Boggs?

17:22.900 --> 17:28.119
- Well, 'cause of his, um...
- 'Cause of his what, Mrs. Boggs?

17:31.040 --> 17:34.500
And we're back on Good Day, Chicago,
joined today by Peter Brackett...

17:34.670 --> 17:37.090
famous columnist for
the Chicago Chronicle.

17:37.250 --> 17:40.170
Peter's written his very first novel.
it's called White Lies,

17:40.340 --> 17:41.590
and he's here to talk about it.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.840
- Peter, first of ell...
- Yes?

17:43.010 --> 17:46.260
I want to tell you that I could not put
your book down last night.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.300
I have to ask you,
are you Ned Grayson?

17:48.470 --> 17:50.180
Who's Ned Grayson?

17:51.350 --> 17:54.640
- The main character, the detective!
- The detective, Ned Grayson.

17:54.810 --> 17:57.480
Well, I would like to be Ned,
but I tell you...

17:57.900 --> 17:59.440
Thank you.
Nice interview.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.210
Bye-bye.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.450
- ...how did you find time to write a novel?
- Well, uh...

18:05.610 --> 18:08.160
- Globe, please.
- I'll take a Globe.

18:09.660 --> 18:11.260
A Globe.

18:13.870 --> 18:16.250
- I'll take a Globe.
- Could I have a Globe?

18:16.420 --> 18:19.290
- A Globe, please.
- You got any Globes left?

18:36.520 --> 18:38.690
Hey, Cindy.

18:39.940 --> 18:41.540
Jeannie?

18:46.150 --> 18:49.950
"No one's gonna get anything else
because there's nothin' else to get."

18:50.120 --> 18:53.330
Guess what? Now I know why
I made you a columnist.

18:53.490 --> 18:57.330
She's an overzealous cub reporter,
second day on the job.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.330
You and I both know I could
scoop her any day of the week.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.010
Yeah? So do it. Tomorrow.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.390
Evans, dig up everything you can
on this Boggs character.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.470
See if he has any friends,
enemies, ex-wives, ex-lovers.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.020
See if he's ever been fired, sued, done time,
owes money, goes to church, pays his bills.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.900
Jeannie, get your head
out of that thing.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.690
Give me the chief of police,
the head of Midrail and the D.A. Sully!

19:21.860 --> 19:25.230
Go down to the train station, nose
around. See if anything smells fishy.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.320
Save me eight inches above the fold.
This will not happen again.

19:31.490 --> 19:33.450
What do you mean
it happened again?

19:39.460 --> 19:40.460
Damn!

19:42.750 --> 19:45.550
- Mr. Brackett? Uh, Mr. Brackett?
- Huh?

19:45.710 --> 19:48.340
- These just came for you.
- Oh, thank you.

20:10.740 --> 20:13.410
I'll tell you we found the coupling
was not defective, all right?

20:13.570 --> 20:16.040
Yeah, but what about the...

20:34.550 --> 20:35.550
What?

20:46.730 --> 20:48.130
Thanks.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.940
- Sabrina Peterson?
- Yeah.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.530
Delivery from Peter Brackett.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.680
Hey, hey,
don't kill the messenger.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.700
- Hi, Peter.
- I was coming back for more.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.410
- Oh, are you?
- Hi.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.830
- Back on the front page!
- Hi!

22:31.710 --> 22:33.510
Pete, it's good
to see you, buddy.

22:33.670 --> 22:36.970
I'm dyin' to read your book, man.
When's it comin' out on tape?

22:37.130 --> 22:39.140
- I gotta get a drink.
- Where'd you disappear to, Smotherman?

22:39.300 --> 22:42.220
I called your office a few months ago,
and they acted like you had the plague.

22:42.390 --> 22:45.560
I know. I'm persona non grate. Didn't you
hear, man? I'm working for the enemy now.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.850
- Don't tell me a Democrat?
- A Democrat and a woman!

22:49.020 --> 22:51.190
- Gayle Robbins. Do you know her?
- Oh, I know the name.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.730
She's a state senator from Wisconsin.
Actually, she's a terrific lady.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.570
She's super bright.
And you know me. I go where duty Calls.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.160
Plus she doubled my salary.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.580
So, Pete, I'm in your book,
right? Come on.

23:01.740 --> 23:05.290
Handsome senator's aide who slips
reporter names of corrupt lobbyists?

23:05.450 --> 23:08.290
- I'm colorful. I'm bigger than life!
- No, Sam, somehow I left you out.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.250
But I'm seriously considering
you for the sequel.

23:10.420 --> 23:13.420
Sure you are. Oh, oh, what is
the story on this train wreck, Peter?

23:13.590 --> 23:16.090
What do you hear? I mean, Midrail
got their ass in a sling, or what?

23:16.260 --> 23:19.140
- Hey, what I hear, you read.
- Mm-hmm.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.430
Speaking of duty calling.
My beautiful date Nadia has returned.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.640
Nadia, old pal of mine,
Peter Brackett.

23:26.810 --> 23:28.600
Actually, Nadia and I have met.

23:28.770 --> 23:32.270
- Once.
- Well, you won't meet again.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.570
Adiós, pal.
Keep in touch.

24:07.430 --> 24:09.440
Stoli. Straight up.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.150
- Champagne.
- Thank you.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.490
Hello, Peterson.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.070
Hello, Brackett.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.700
Giving the front page
the night off?

24:21.860 --> 24:24.490
Oh, I put my story to bed
hours ago. How about you?

24:24.660 --> 24:27.240
The press is rolling
as we speak.

24:27.410 --> 24:30.920
- I look forward to reading it.
- You read the Chronicle?

24:31.080 --> 24:34.090
Well, I thought someone
in town still should.

24:37.630 --> 24:40.220
You know, I've been reading
you, too, Peterson.

24:42.470 --> 24:47.260
"Zoo Transfers Feisty Gorilla"
by Sabrina J. Peterson.

24:47.430 --> 24:49.350
You were using
your middle initial back then.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.640
I take it as a compliment
that a man of your stature

24:51.810 --> 24:53.850
takes time to research my early work.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.610
Well, your early work
is very entertaining.

24:56.770 --> 24:58.190
I mean, I especially like
the story you did...

24:58.360 --> 25:00.860
blowing the lid off
the Pillsbury Bake-off contest.

25:01.030 --> 25:03.700
You know, entering under a fake name
and baking a pie

25:03.860 --> 25:05.910
without using one Pillsbury product?

25:06.080 --> 25:09.910
- And winning. Let's not forget that.
- Yeah, it's very impressive.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.750
But my favorite is when you went
undercover as a hooker.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.630
Now, I'd have paid to see that one.

25:14.790 --> 25:17.290
I bet you would have.
Oh, by the way...

25:17.460 --> 25:20.590
I never did thank you for the mutt.
He's been quite an addition to my life.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.380
Oh, you're very welcome.
I hope you named him after me.

25:23.550 --> 25:27.180
I certainly did. Yeah, I've grown
real attached to Little Dick.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.390
You know, there's something
about you, Peterson.

25:31.560 --> 25:35.190
- Irritating, aren't I?
- The truth is, you make me itch.

25:35.350 --> 25:37.360
Well, I suggest you get yourself
some calamine lotion...

25:37.520 --> 25:40.280
because I'm loving this town,
and I'm here to stay.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.030
Stop the presses! I got a bulletin.

25:42.190 --> 25:44.320
What? The coppers
are actually offering news?

25:44.490 --> 25:47.490
Guess who just showed up at the station
with a duffel bag and a statement?

25:47.660 --> 25:49.240
- Ray Boggs.
- What'd he say?

25:49.410 --> 25:52.710
"I'm innocent." He said the liquor
they found in his locker was e plant.

25:52.870 --> 25:56.210
Insisted on a polygraph.
Passed with flyin' colors.

25:58.130 --> 26:00.590
Macy's meets Gimbel's.
Love this!

26:00.750 --> 26:04.010
Oh, sorry, kids. Just, uh, shake hands,
say "sex, " I'm outta your hair.

26:05.550 --> 26:07.600
- Sex.
- Sex.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.970
So, um, what does it all mean?

26:09.140 --> 26:11.350
Does it mean the crash
wasn't caused by human error?

26:11.520 --> 26:14.940
It means this poor schnook Boggs
could actually be innocent.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.360
Well, what are you saying?
You think we're about to lynch a guy

26:19.520 --> 26:20.690
for something he never did?

26:20.860 --> 26:23.360
Worse! We could be
on the wrong story.

26:23.530 --> 26:26.660
- Then you better get on the right story.
- Uh-oh.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.990
- Sabrina?
- I gotta go.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.530
I'll call you when I get something.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.250
- You see anything suspicious in there?
- I didn't see a thing suspicious.

26:33.410 --> 26:35.290
- Not a thing?
- No, it was a normal run.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.290
Well, really think about the day. I mean,
was there an unusual amount of people?

26:38.460 --> 26:40.840
I don't know.

26:43.630 --> 26:45.840
So, nobody could have serviced
the train after Ray Boggs?

26:46.010 --> 26:47.050
No, not that afternoon.

26:47.220 --> 26:49.140
I open up every day
at 7:00.

26:49.300 --> 26:53.430
Did you see anyone that day that
struck you as suspicious or unusual?

26:54.600 --> 26:56.480
Did you overhear
any conversation?

26:56.640 --> 27:00.150
So, tell me, what's she got?

27:00.310 --> 27:03.320
Aw, she's got the same thing
as you, boss. A big nothing.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.480
Ah!

27:07.990 --> 27:10.410
Hi, okay, I've got
good news and bad news.

27:10.570 --> 27:13.540
The good news is one of the passengers
remembered seeing the groom's dad...

27:13.700 --> 27:15.700
taking a video of the bride
and groom boarding the train.

27:15.870 --> 27:18.710
So I called him, and I can pick
up the tape anytime after 6:00.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.710
Great!
What's the bad news?

27:20.880 --> 27:23.920
Sabrina Peterson has an appointment
to see the groom right after lunch.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.510
He'll probably tell her about the video,
and knowing her,

27:26.670 --> 27:28.340
she could get to it before we do.

27:37.810 --> 27:40.150
She trained you well.

27:45.650 --> 27:47.820
Hey, Lonnie, How ya doin'?

28:00.290 --> 28:04.040
Peterson!
What are you doin' here?

28:04.210 --> 28:05.800
A girl's gotta eat.
What are you doin' here?

28:05.960 --> 28:08.130
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.
I was hungry.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.260
- This is a famous newspaper haunt.
- So I've heard.

28:11.430 --> 28:13.890
Yeah, Ben Hecht used
to eat here back in the '20s.

28:14.050 --> 28:18.270
They have a little plaque with his name on
it in the back booth right next to mine.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.230
- What'll you have, Pete?
- I'll have a, uh- What's that you're eating?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.440
That looks great.

28:22.610 --> 28:24.400
Club sandwich on whole wheat.
No bacon, no mayo.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.900
I'll have the same on white,
extra bacon, extra mayo.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.900
- Mm-hmm.
- And a Coke.

28:30.070 --> 28:32.990
You got a lot of notes there,
Peterson. You on to something?

28:33.950 --> 28:36.080
You wanna know what I have?

28:36.240 --> 28:38.450
It's gonna cost you 35 cents.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.540
- Do you have change? I gotta make a call.
- Oh, sure.

28:48.630 --> 28:50.170
- Tricky!
- Mm-hmm.

28:50.340 --> 28:51.930
Save my seat.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.530
Nothing personal.

29:29.630 --> 29:31.550
- Long line.
- Mmm.

29:32.970 --> 29:35.640
So long, Brackett.
See ya in the funny papers.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.000
Bon voyage.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.850
Poplar Grove.

29:46.110 --> 29:49.820
Poplar Grove.
Where is it?

29:49.980 --> 29:51.650
Oy, it's far.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.340
He sent me on
a wild-goose chase.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.100
- Lindy, I will not be late.
- You don't understand.

30:25.270 --> 30:27.270
No, I do!
I want the book to sell.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.540
I promise I'll be the first to arrive,
the last to leave.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.650
I'll see you in ten minutes.

30:30.820 --> 30:33.150
- In five.
- Fine, five.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.780
- isn't she beautiful, huh?
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

30:40.950 --> 30:41.950
Thank you so much.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.290
Nice camera work, Dad.
Bye, Mom.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.500
So long, sweetie.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.670
Don't call us.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.340
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye!

31:08.690 --> 31:11.110
- Yep.
- ls this Miss Peterson from the Globe?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.440
Uh, yes, it is.
What can I do for you?

31:13.610 --> 31:17.070
My name 's Danny Brown, and me and my
friends, we lifted some stuff at the crash.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.320
- The train crash?
- Yeah. I found something in this briefcase.

31:20.490 --> 31:23.080
I don't know exactly what it is,
but I think it looks important.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.580
And my friend says that you guys
pay for information like this.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.370
Where can I meet you?

31:31.710 --> 31:35.340
Nice camera work.
Nice camera work.

31:35.510 --> 31:39.220
Nice camera work, Dad.
Nice camera work, Dad.

31:56.490 --> 32:00.410
- Nice camera work, Dad. Bye, Mom.
- So long, sweetie.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.580
5:40.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.090
So nobody could have serviced
the train after Ray Boggs?

32:17.260 --> 32:18.800
No, not that afternoon.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.300
The guy who comes in after Boggs
was put on a brake job on Track 9.

32:22.470 --> 32:27.430
I didn't have anybody workin' on that track
'til 7:00, 7:15. That I can promise you.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.550
Hello?

33:14.690 --> 33:15.890
Danny?

33:31.500 --> 33:33.830
Danny, are you here?

33:44.010 --> 33:46.850
Danny, are you here?

33:55.980 --> 33:59.570
We must engage and rearrange

33:59.730 --> 34:03.280
And turn this planet back to one

34:03.450 --> 34:07.070
So tell me why we got to die

34:07.240 --> 34:10.790
And kill each other one by one

34:10.949 --> 34:14.290
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub

34:14.460 --> 34:17.250
We've got to dance and be in love

34:18.670 --> 34:21.550
But what I really want to know is

36:04.860 --> 36:08.570
Oh, jeez.
How'd she do that?

36:17.790 --> 36:21.170
Mrs. Beekman? Peter Brackett from the
Chronicle. Thanks for getting back to me.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.340
Uh, Mr. Brackett,
this turns out to be a bad time.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.130
Well, look, I have just
e few quick questions.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.010
If you could tell me why
your husband was on the train...

36:27.170 --> 36:30.090
Look, my children are home.
I can't talk right now.

36:30.260 --> 36:34.510
Um, look, I have to work tonight. Can
you meet me at my office around 9:00?

36:34.680 --> 36:36.520
Sure, sure.
Around 9:00?

36:36.680 --> 36:39.890
Mm-hmm. Um,
it's at 6395 Walton.

36:40.060 --> 36:43.270
- 6395 Walton.
- Yeah. Suite 1264.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.070
- Sixty-five?
- No, 64.

36:46.230 --> 36:48.570
- Sixty-four.
- it's safe there.

36:48.740 --> 36:52.030
Uh, are you all right?

36:56.410 --> 36:59.290
Okay, so you've been to the
relatives of all the victims.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.710
I've been to everybody
but the science teacher's wife.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.840
So far, no one had anything in
a briefcase worth getting killed over.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Actually, so far,
no one even had a briefcase.

37:08.170 --> 37:09.920
- That's healthy.
- Mmm, thanks.

37:10.090 --> 37:13.970
The only good news is I finally have
a lead that Brackett doesn't have.

37:14.140 --> 37:18.350
Oh, man. I am haunted
by the image of that kid.

37:18.520 --> 37:22.060
Sabrina, there's a Delores Beekman on your line.
Says she'll see you in an hour.

37:22.230 --> 37:25.190
Great! Don't lose her.
The science teacher's wife.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.730
Oh, be careful.
There's a quarter in your sandwich.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.320
Hmm.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.540
Goin' up?

38:27.750 --> 38:29.790
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

38:44.810 --> 38:47.730
- What does this mean?
- it's probably just the wind.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.520
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Sorry.

38:49.690 --> 38:52.030
- I was looking for the phone.
- it's not under my blouse.

38:52.190 --> 38:54.400
- I just realized that.
- Mm-hmm.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.370
I suggest we get out of here
as fast as we can.

38:58.530 --> 39:00.530
- Why?
- Women's intuition.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.160
Peterson, tell me if you think
we're in some kind of trouble here.

39:03.330 --> 39:05.790
Brackett, I think we're in
some kind of trouble here.

39:20.010 --> 39:22.220
What kind of trouble
are we in here, Peterson?

39:29.440 --> 39:31.040
Oh, man!

40:19.150 --> 40:21.280
I can't get it open.

40:39.340 --> 40:40.340
Oh!

40:41.970 --> 40:45.640
- Think that's about it, trouble-wise?
- I guess not.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
307.

42:33.750 --> 42:37.830
You know, Peterson, if I knew what
you knew, and you knew what I knew...

42:38.000 --> 42:41.170
we just might be able
to live through this story.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.810
Mrs. Beekman?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.570
Mrs. Beekman?

43:07.910 --> 43:10.580
Looks like the Widow Beekman
left in a hurry.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.650
What's that?

43:25.840 --> 43:27.760
Wait a minute.

43:32.350 --> 43:33.350
Okay.

43:38.190 --> 43:41.110
- I'll go check out the other room.
- Okay.

45:03.100 --> 45:06.900
Can you meet me at my office around
9:00'? it's safe there. it's safe there.

45:07.070 --> 45:09.110
It's safe there.
it's safe there.

45:13.530 --> 45:17.240
- You find anything?
- Not a thing. You?

45:17.410 --> 45:19.010
Nothing.

45:20.290 --> 45:22.210
Listen, um...

45:24.130 --> 45:27.460
I know I shouldn't be
telling you this, but, uh...

45:27.630 --> 45:30.130
I think I'm just gonna
bail out of this story.

45:30.300 --> 45:34.300
Really?
That doesn't sound like you.

45:34.470 --> 45:38.560
Well, neither does leaping off
elevators and dodging bullets.

45:39.890 --> 45:40.890
Oh.

45:42.520 --> 45:47.440
Look, I, I love my work, and this
is definitely a very sexy story, but...

45:47.610 --> 45:50.740
I guess I'm just not out out for
this lethal weapon stuff, you know?

45:53.070 --> 45:54.470
Thanks.

45:56.990 --> 46:00.370
I love out-scooping you,
I have to admit, but...

46:01.750 --> 46:04.420
I've got my whole life
in front of me, and...

46:04.580 --> 46:07.960
to tell you the truth, this
whole thing just got too much.

46:08.130 --> 46:12.260
It's too dangerous.
I'm, I'm scared.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.800
You know, Peterson, I'm supposed
to be on my book tour right now.

46:15.970 --> 46:19.720
Getting my head blown off wasn't
exactly on my agenda, either.

46:23.100 --> 46:25.690
I'll make ya a deal.

46:25.850 --> 46:29.230
If you quit this story,
so will I.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.940
You don't have to say that
just to make me feel better.

46:32.110 --> 46:35.660
I'm not sayin' it to make you feel better.
I'm sayin' it to make me feel better.

46:35.820 --> 46:37.910
I mean, you were really puttin'
the pressure on, you know?

46:38.070 --> 46:40.490
Your face on trucks
all over the city.

46:40.660 --> 46:43.250
That wild-goose chase.

46:43.410 --> 46:46.120
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, it was very inventive.

46:46.290 --> 46:48.880
I fell for it.
I deserved it.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.960
Yeah, that was a good one.

46:52.130 --> 46:53.920
I gotta thank you, Peterson.

46:54.090 --> 46:58.340
Because of you, I remembered
how much I love newspapering.

46:59.890 --> 47:01.930
Hey, you're a legend.

47:02.100 --> 47:05.310
It's amazing just being in
the same arena with you, really.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.810
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

47:08.980 --> 47:10.900
Yeah.
I'm always okay.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.900
- So long.
- Take care.

47:27.080 --> 47:29.710
Where can I catch
the 7:15 to Spring Creek?

47:29.880 --> 47:31.790
- Four-B.
- Thank you.

48:14.210 --> 48:17.670
Excuse me.
I think you're in my seat.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.930
Sorry, pal. Too early
in the morning, I guess.

48:26.390 --> 48:27.890
- Morning paper?
- I'll take the Globe.

48:28.060 --> 48:29.060
I'll take the Chronicle.

48:29.230 --> 48:32.400
I'll be right back with complimentary
orange juice and champagne.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.900
- I'll just have the orange juice.
- I'll just have the champagne.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.660
That was quite a performance
you gave last night.

48:43.830 --> 48:47.120
- You weren't bad yourself.
- But the tears!

48:47.290 --> 48:49.830
Brilliant, really.
Academy Award caliber.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.960
Thank you.
I try.

48:53.130 --> 48:57.260
By the way, our friend last night was
a pro recruited out of South America.

48:57.420 --> 48:59.590
How do you know?

48:59.760 --> 49:02.470
I have friends in low places.
As I said, Peterson...

49:02.640 --> 49:05.760
if I tell you what I know,
and you tell me what you know...

49:05.930 --> 49:08.470
Look, Brackett, it's not my job
to tell you anything.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.810
I'm your competition,
not your girl Friday.

49:12.230 --> 49:15.230
- I'm suggesting we team up.
- With each other?

49:15.400 --> 49:18.400
Well, we'll investigate together,
but we'll write separately.

49:18.570 --> 49:21.030
I mean, we'll be like the,
uh, Hardy Boys...

49:21.200 --> 49:22.990
except one of us
will be a girl.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.450
- A woman.
- Mr. Brackett?

49:25.620 --> 49:27.370
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but, uh...

49:27.540 --> 49:31.660
I am in the middle of your book,
and I just can't put it down.

49:31.830 --> 49:34.040
Would you hate
autographing it for me?

49:34.210 --> 49:36.840
No, I'd love to!
Peterson, you got a pen?

49:40.170 --> 49:42.510
Have you read it?
Oh, I'm sure you have.

49:42.680 --> 49:46.640
I keep meaning to,
but no, actually, I...

49:46.800 --> 49:49.180
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

49:51.350 --> 49:53.940
Is, uh, that in
the 312 area code?

49:54.100 --> 49:55.500
Mm-hmm.

49:56.940 --> 49:59.480
- I may need that.
- Oh.

49:59.650 --> 50:02.150
So, what do you think?
Are we a team?

50:05.700 --> 50:08.030
I suppose it is
the sensible thing to do.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.250
Well, we're gonna have to be
completely honest with each other.

50:11.410 --> 50:13.540
- No more double-crossing.
- No more tricks.

50:13.710 --> 50:16.630
Partners,
five-oh, five-oh.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.840
Five-oh, five-oh.

50:27.350 --> 50:29.970
- Be right back.
- Peterson.

50:31.270 --> 50:33.600
You have a little
orange juice mustache.

50:35.190 --> 50:37.560
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

51:26.780 --> 51:29.580
Is this yours?

51:29.780 --> 51:31.830
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

51:40.750 --> 51:44.880
So, Brackett, since we toasted, and now
that we're partners and everything...

51:45.050 --> 51:48.550
I feel I should at least tell you
why I'm on the plane to Spring Creek.

51:50.260 --> 51:53.180
I found this when we were at
the Beekman house last night.

51:53.350 --> 51:55.430
Here's the missing story.

51:58.310 --> 52:01.520
Darryl Beekman's father. I thought
he'd be a guy worth talking to.

52:01.690 --> 52:05.610
He left his job at
Chess Chemical after 29 years.

52:05.780 --> 52:08.650
Now, why would anyone leave their job
one year snort of retirement?

52:08.820 --> 52:11.740
Gee, I don't know. I've only been
a Hardy Boy for five minutes.

52:12.990 --> 52:15.490
That's funny, Peterson.

52:25.050 --> 52:27.550
Hi.
I'm looking for Sabrina.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.300
Oh, she's out of town.
I'm sorry.

52:30.470 --> 52:33.550
She's, uh, on assignment
in, uh, Wisconsin.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.560
Spring, Spring Creek,
I think it was.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.430
- She'll be back in a few days.
- Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.920
That was 24,
so Beekman's must be next.

53:26.570 --> 53:30.280
"Dr. Darryl M. Beekman,
genetic engineering pioneer...

53:30.440 --> 53:33.490
died Tuesday in a fire
at his Spring Creek home."

53:33.660 --> 53:35.240
A week before the train crash.

53:35.410 --> 53:38.200
- The plot thickens.
- Ma'am, shh.

53:38.370 --> 53:41.040
I'm sorry. Peterson,
calm down, will you please?

53:41.210 --> 53:44.380
Sorry. Go ahead. Y-You read it
to yourself, then I'll read it.

53:49.510 --> 53:51.470
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

53:58.140 --> 54:01.350
- What's LDF?
- Why? You've heard of it?

54:01.520 --> 54:03.390
No. Never.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.480
How would I have heard of it?

54:13.780 --> 54:16.700
"While at Chess, Dr. Beekman
served as head researcher...

54:16.870 --> 54:19.700
on the genetically engineered
hormone LDF."

54:27.380 --> 54:30.420
I knew you were trouble
the first time I laid eyes on you.

54:30.590 --> 54:33.090
Major league trouble,
I said to myself.

54:33.260 --> 54:36.890
- What's happening here?
- I'm dissolving our partnership.

54:37.050 --> 54:39.600
- Why?
- Because you just lied to me.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.350
Now, you don't wanna tell me
about LDF, fine.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.770
It's each man for himself.
Fine.

54:44.940 --> 54:47.560
You got it.
You're on your own.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.910
What about Beekman's
Christmas card?

55:00.990 --> 55:02.790
You're also a pickpocket?

55:02.950 --> 55:05.000
Jesus, Peterson,
you're incorrigible!

55:05.160 --> 55:07.000
Now, I was gonna tell you
about that...

55:07.170 --> 55:10.170
but there are moments when you divulge
information in a story like this.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.380
I was just waiting for
the proper moment, that's all.

55:12.550 --> 55:15.380
Which is gonna be when, professor?
When you finally get me in the sack?

55:15.550 --> 55:19.550
Oh, I got a news flash
for you, Peterson.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.600
I have absolutely no desire to
get you in the sack whatsoever.

55:22.770 --> 55:25.480
- Yeah, right.
- For starters, honey, you ain't my type.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.560
Really? I didn't know
you had a type.

55:27.730 --> 55:29.900
I do.
The opposite of you.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.020
Tall, dark and stupid?

55:32.940 --> 55:35.320
Peterson, good-bye.

55:35.490 --> 55:37.570
- it's been original.
- Mmm.

55:43.950 --> 55:46.150
You know...

55:46.710 --> 55:52.210
You were right. I should've
told you about the Christmas card.

55:52.380 --> 55:56.130
And maybe I overreacted to LDF.

55:56.300 --> 55:59.430
No, I, I should've told you sooner.
it's my fault.

55:59.590 --> 56:02.970
I accept your apology.
So, tell me now.

56:04.850 --> 56:06.730
The boy I told you about,
the one that called me...

56:06.890 --> 56:08.560
said he found something important
in the briefcase.

56:08.730 --> 56:09.730
Yeah.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.360
He had the letters "L-D"
written on his palm.

56:11.520 --> 56:15.190
I guess he died before he could write
the I had no idea what it meant.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.400
Honest.
Girl Scout's honor.

56:18.570 --> 56:21.410
- That's not the Girl Scout salute.
- Oh.

56:21.570 --> 56:23.870
- Wrong hand, Peterson.
- Oh, well, okay.

56:24.030 --> 56:26.910
So I was never a Girl Scout,
but I'm telling you the truth, Brackett.

56:31.500 --> 56:32.630
I swear.

56:32.790 --> 56:35.550
Okay, so tell me.
What's LDF?

56:35.710 --> 56:40.090
"LDF is a genetically engineered hormone
for dairy cows. It could be the fir... "

56:40.260 --> 56:43.510
Somebody's trying to kill us
over a cow hormone?

56:43.680 --> 56:46.390
"Could be the first commercial success
of genetic engineering...

56:46.560 --> 56:48.930
that directly affects food
for humans."

56:49.100 --> 56:53.980
"Milk Hormone Stirs Fear."
Okay, now we're talkin'.

56:54.150 --> 56:57.900
"LDF milk tests will be reviewed by State's
Agricultural Committee Chairwoman...

56:58.070 --> 57:00.490
Gayle Robbins."
Bingo!

57:00.650 --> 57:02.410
- You wanna know about LDF?
- Yeah.

57:02.570 --> 57:03.990
You've come to the right place.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.080
- In English, Sam, please.
- Okay, here's the deal.

57:06.240 --> 57:09.410
Normally it takes a calf two years to
mature into a milk-producing cow, right?

57:09.580 --> 57:11.580
So, Chess figured, why wait
that long taking care of a calf?

57:11.750 --> 57:12.750
It's not making you any money.

57:12.920 --> 57:16.630
So they invent this hormone LDF. They
shoot that stuff into a newborn calf.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.550
Nine months later, you got yourself a
full-grown, milk-producing, moneymaking...

57:20.720 --> 57:23.760
- Franken-cow.
- That's exactly what I thought at first.

57:23.930 --> 57:26.470
But then from what we hear the cows
are healthy, and the tests show...

57:26.640 --> 57:28.640
I hates these tours!

57:28.810 --> 57:31.440
And the tests show that the milk's,
uh, pure. So, there you go.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.100
Say, what kind of profits can
Chess make on a thing like this?

57:34.270 --> 57:37.650
This thing, my boy, could revolutionize
the entire worldwide dairy industry.

57:37.820 --> 57:40.490
Potentially the biggest moneymaker
that a chemical company has seen...

57:40.650 --> 57:42.530
- since NutraSweet.
- Yeah?

57:42.700 --> 57:44.660
- Yeah.
- So, how much can they make?

57:44.820 --> 57:47.410
Oh, somewhere in the neighborhood
of a billion dollars a year.

57:47.580 --> 57:51.540
- Oh, nice neighborhood.
- Yeah. I wouldn't mind living there myself.

57:51.710 --> 57:53.620
Oh, hi.
You got out early.

57:53.790 --> 57:55.630
One of the advantages
of being chairperson.

57:55.790 --> 57:57.920
You get to adjourn the meetings.

57:58.090 --> 58:00.130
- How'd that school board thing work out?
- On, nothing to worry about.

58:00.300 --> 58:03.090
- These are friends of mine from Chicago.
- Oh, hi. Gayle Robbins.

58:03.260 --> 58:04.640
- Peter Brackett from the Chronicle.
- Yes.

58:04.800 --> 58:05.840
- And this is Sabrina, uh...
- Peterson.

58:06.010 --> 58:07.970
Of the Globe.
Sorry.

58:08.140 --> 58:10.640
Yes. it's nice to meet you. Sam,
are we having a press conference?

58:10.810 --> 58:12.730
No, no, no. They're just doing
some research on LDF, that's all.

58:12.890 --> 58:13.890
- Really?
- Yep.

58:14.060 --> 58:15.100
What do you think?

58:15.270 --> 58:16.810
We were just gonna ask you that same
question, being the head of the committee.

58:16.980 --> 58:19.150
Uh, it really doesn't behoove the Senator
to render an opinion on that matter...

58:19.320 --> 58:21.610
- Sam!
- All right, go ahead and render.

58:21.780 --> 58:24.950
Give me a buzz after the FDA completes
its review. We'll talk then.

58:25.110 --> 58:27.410
- Ready, Senator?
- Sam.

58:27.570 --> 58:30.120
I know, Pete. You got like a thousand
questions, right? Okay, okay.

58:30.290 --> 58:35.290
Look, I got a, an hour here. Okay? What do
you say I take both of you to dinner, huh?

58:35.460 --> 58:37.330
On the house?

58:39.420 --> 58:41.800
Two New Yorks, rare.

58:41.960 --> 58:45.800
And one steamed vegetable plate,
no salt, no oil, no butter.

58:45.970 --> 58:47.890
Thank you.

58:48.050 --> 58:51.010
So, you started to say that during
Vietnam, Chess manufactured...

58:51.180 --> 58:55.020
Oh, you know, just things like
napalm, Agent Orange, you know?

58:55.190 --> 58:56.600
All that wonderful stuff.

58:56.770 --> 58:59.020
And then the war ended and
their profits really dried up.

58:59.190 --> 59:01.900
For a while, it looked like the
company was on its last legs.

59:02.070 --> 59:04.190
And then, along comes
the genetic revolution.

59:04.360 --> 59:07.950
And boy, things really heated up for them.
LDF could put them right back on top.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.530
- What's the Chess family like?
- Oh, boy.

59:10.700 --> 59:14.870
Well, the old man's a real zealot, you know?
He's kinda like a Ross Perot wannabe.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.750
His kid, Willy, kind of runs things now.
I don't know too much about him.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.000
I think he went to Yale,
and then straight to work for Daddy.

59:20.170 --> 59:23.050
- Did you know him at Yale?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

59:23.210 --> 59:25.550
No, I think he's younger than me. How
did you remember that I went to Yale?

59:25.720 --> 59:27.720
That is incredible.
You've got such an amazing memory.

59:27.890 --> 59:29.480
I can't remember my own name.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.790
It's possible that I met him at school, but...

59:32.040 --> 59:33.970
I doubt it.
I don't even think he graduated.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.810
What year would he have been
if he had graduated?

59:36.980 --> 59:39.020
I don't know.
Let me think. Uh...

59:39.430 --> 59:42.650
- What year did you graduate?
- Me? '73. No, '74.

59:42.820 --> 59:45.150
So that would make him class of
'76, '77, something like that.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.700
You know, Gayle's met him a few times.
He's supposed to be a nice guy.

59:47.860 --> 59:51.740
Not exactly a rocket scientist,
but he...

59:51.910 --> 59:56.120
What's going on here exactly, guys? I mean,
why are you so interested in LDF, huh?

59:56.290 --> 01:00:00.460
Oh, Peterson here is
a big milk drinker. That's all.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.540
Oh, well, it d...
It does a body good.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.880
Sorry. C'mon, you're not
gonna tell me?

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:10.010
It's gotta be big if both the Globe and
the Chronicle are in bed together on it.

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:15.890
I wouldn't say we're exactly
in bed together.

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:20.690
Check, please.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.660
Oh. Okay, now.
In case you have any more questions...

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.200
or if you finally decide to tell me
what you've actually got up your sleeve...

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:37.290
- here's my card. it's got my direct dial on it.
- Oh, thanks, Sam.

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.580
- Where are you parked?
- In the lot over there.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.120
Oh, perfect.
We're gonna pass by...

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:44.130
the best frozen yogurt joint
in the entire state.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.420
- Yeah?
- it's on Peterson.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.800
- Look out!
- Sam!

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:52.970
Move!

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.350
Sam, are you okay?

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.860
What the hell
was that all about?

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.860
Medwick, it's me.
Just checking in.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.030
Listen, I've put together a
"just the facts, ma'am" kind of thing...

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.490
and wanted to
run it by you, okay?

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.740
- They know you're there?
- Uh, no.

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:17.700
- I guess so far they don't know we're here.
- You're lucky.

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.830
Yeah, real lucky.
So, here's what we know:

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.170
Beekman was the head researcher
on LDF.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.840
He retires mysteriously,
then dies a week later.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.050
His son boards a train with something
in his briefcase that his dad sent him.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.680
The train crashes, the son dies,
and the briefcase is stolen.

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:36.680
The kid who stole it is murdered
but before he dies

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.350
he writes the initials "LD" on his palm.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.850
LD means LDF, and LDF means
a billion dollars a year.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.310
So you tell me.
All this adds up to...

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.360
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to Chess Chemical.

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:52.780
Our first stop on today's tour will be the
Chess Family Science Discovery Center.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:56.660
Now, as we walk in pairs
down the Biology of Tomorrow corridor...

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:01.330
I'd like to point out some of the
everyday products created here at Chess.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.460
For example, the cold medicine
that I forgot to take this morning...

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:07.790
as well as the disposable diapers
I used for my little one last night.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.590
Now, as we continue on...

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.970
Extension 307 is a 72-year-old
cafeteria worker named Sadie.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.970
Hair net, orthopedic shoes.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.680
Are you sure?
Maybe it was 3-O-something else.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:21.100
No, no, no. I'm positive.
Here, look.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.560
You wanna get out of here, or take a stroll
down the Biology of Tomorrow corridor?

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:29.400
Rule number one of investigative reporting,
Peterson, is find out what you're up against.

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:34.240
- Let's stroll.
- What's rule number two?

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.240
Stay clear of all surveillance cameras
when visiting the lair of the enemy.

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:41.310
Thanks.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.630
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.130
- Wilson Chess.
- Sabrina Peterson.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.630
- And Mr. Peterson?
- Actually, the name's Brackett.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.300
Peter Brackett, the writer.

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:02.430
Of course. Well, what brings you
to this neck of the woods?

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.940
I'm doin' e little research
on e new novel, Wilson.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.940
You're kidding?
What, here at Chess?

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.440
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the new one about?

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:14.030
It's a murder mystery set against
the backdrop of a chemical company.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:19.120
Sounds intriguing, but I'm always
a sucker for a good murder yarn.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.660
Aren't you, Miss Peterson?

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:24.790
As long as the bad guy gets it
in the end, I'm happy.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.630
W... Well, have fun. And don't forget to
change the names to protect the innocent.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.420
So much for rule number three:
Avoid insulting...

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.550
the men who may be trying
to kill you.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.010
- I was just looking for you, sir. Look at this.
- Hello.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.430
- it's fine.
- You look very nice today.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.600
- Thank you.
- We missed you for lunch. It was...

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.730
right through to
the research farm behind me...

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.980
where scientists are fine-tuning
Mother Nature with such innovative...

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:52.730
products for the future as the
Livestock Development Factor, LDF.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.780
Now, if you'll Come with me,
I'd like to show you a film...

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.900
that highlights some of the exciting
things we're doing here at Chess.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.780
Don't worry, parents.
it's G-rated.

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.120
- Hey, where'd you guys go on your break?
- We looked for you.

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:05.250
- We did.
- Oh, I had to go to the lab.

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:09.330
Rule number four: Get close to someone
who's close to the enemy.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.840
How am I supposed to calm down?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.050
You promised me this was going
to be taken care of...

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:17.050
and now they are here
in my building.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.470
Ernesto, I can't
handle this anymore.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.730
Just make it happen.

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:29.310
- Want us to pick you up at Ruby's tonight?
- Oh, I'll meet you there.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.860
It's better if we take our own cars,
in case one of us gets lucky.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.900
You mean, in case
there's a miracle, right?

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.780
You never know.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.830
Well, what do you know?
Huh.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:25.140
Evans, this is great. This is good.
You got any leads on him?

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.720
Pete, I'm looking
for some more information on...

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:27.930
Come in.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.520
- Hello? Mr. Brackett?
- Hi.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.350
Mr. Brackett, we haven 't come up
with anything yet, but when we do...

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.980
Yeah, okay. Well, stay on it
and I'll check with you later.

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:38.150
Yeah.

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:40.570
Interesting news.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.820
It seems Willy Chess
did go to Yale.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:45.910
- Who's Ernesto Vargas?
- Well, that's the interesting news.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:49.410
The reason Sam was confused about
whether or not Chess graduated...

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.750
- is because he was expelled.
- For?

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:53.200
Burning down
the English Department.

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:55.460
Somethin' about a problem
with one of his professors.

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:59.500
Young Willy and his cohort,
this South American kid Vargas...

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:04.420
they decided to torch the place for revenge,
they were caught and properly booted out.

01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:06.840
A fire back then,
a fire at Beekman's.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.140
A South American friend,
a South American assassin.

01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:12.850
- Where's Vargas now?
- Evans can't seem to get a line on him.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.440
- Maybe Sam could help.
- Yeah. Good idea.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.520
Good idea.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.610
You don't know
what I did with his, uh...

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.160
Thank you.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.540
By the way, I dressed like this because
I figured this is the way...

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.750
you're supposed to dress
at these pickup places...

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.880
and I didn't want
to stand out or anything.

01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:47.550
Yeah. No chance of anyone
noticing you, Peterson.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.800
- That's good thinking.
- Sam Smotherman's office.

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:51.510
- Hi. Is he in?
- Who's calling please?

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.520
- Peter Brackett.
- Just a minute.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.140
By the way, Peterson, that reminds me.
We never did finish that other discussion.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:58.770
- What other discussion?
- Pete, hello.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.730
Sam, how ya doin'?

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.820
Well, I'm all right,
believe it or not.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.070
Well, I knew you'd recover. Listen,
can you check on an old Yalie for me?

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.320
A name came up. We can't seem
to get a lead on the guy.

01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.160
I'm sorry. Just one second.
Sure. Who is he?

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.490
Well, he was at Yale
the same time as Willy Chess.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.870
- His name is, uh, Ernesto Vargas.
- Bargas?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.250
No, no, no.
Vargas with a "V" like Victor.

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.290
Oh, Vargas. That doesn't sound familiar,
but I'll check him out.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.170
All right. Well, look, I'm gonna be in and
out, so if you come up with anything...

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:27.590
like where he is or how we can reach
him, call my office, ask for Evans.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.800
Yeah, I'll make a deal with you,
though. I find this Vargas guy...

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:32.260
then you're gonna clue me in
on what you're workin' on?

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.140
If he finds Vargas, will we clue
him in on what we're working on?

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.310
No.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.899
You got it, buddy! Thanks a lot.
I'll see ya later.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.439
Rule number five, Peterson:
Always humor those who can help you.

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:50.279
Now, what other conversation
did you want to finish?

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:52.950
Oh, the one about me
wanting to get you in the sack.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.540
Oh, that. Well, forget it.
I didn't really think...

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.500
No, no, no, Peterson.
This is important.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:03.170
I want you to know that I see you
strictly as a fellow newspaperman.

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.960
I mean that sincerely.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:09.130
I see you as nothing else,
and I never will.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.550
You have my word on it.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.930
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.560
Well, thanks.
That makes me feel really good.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.810
I appreciate it.
I, I, I, I do. Thanks.

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:21.850
You're welcome, kid.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:26.189
There 's gonna be
a heartache tonight

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:28.939
A heartache tonight I know

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:35.410
Gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon shinin' bright

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.830
Kim, introduce me.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.710
Michael, this is Robin.
Robin, this is Michael.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.750
- Hi.
- Robin's thinking of moving here.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.840
Do it. We need more cute babes
in this town.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.300
Yeah, right. Like there aren't
already four babes to every man.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.680
- Kim, look who's here.
- Dixon, what are you doing here?

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.350
- Didn't your wife just have a baby?
- I'm celebrating!

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.350
- Yeah, right.
- Dance?

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.230
That's the other problem.
Small town, big chemical company.

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.650
Everybody knows
everything about...

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:11.820
Whoa, daddy!
Look what just walked in.

01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:17.620
Somebody's gonna hurt someone

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.240
Before the night is through

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.250
Who? The guy
with the black suit?

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:26.000
Somebody's gonna come undone

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.380
There's nothin' we can do

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:33.590
You don't think he's like
off-the-charts hot?

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.060
I don't know that I'd go right to
off-the-charts. You think so?

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.220
I know so.

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:45.690
I also know I haven't been laid
in more months than I care to admit.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.780
- How ya doin'?
- Ooh, great now.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940
Good.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.030
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Absolutely.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.410
- I'll have what the lady's having.
- Comin' right up.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.290
I'm fine, thank you.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:15.340
I don't like you

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:19.510
- I'm David.
- I'm horny.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.600
Seems that I'm always

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.440
- Thinkin' of you
- Oh!

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.800
Ohh-Ohh-Ohh

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.110
You treat me badly

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.820
I love you madly

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:38.660
You've really got a hold on me

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.780
Really got a hold on me

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:47.350
You really got a hold on me

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:52.530
Baby, I love you

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.430
And all I want you to do

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:59.470
ls just hold me

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.510
Hold me Hold me

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.940
- Hold
- Do you wanna dance?

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.900
- Hold
- I'd love to.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.070
Tighter, honey

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:21.350
Tighter

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.480
Tighter

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Ohhh

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:39.010
I don't wanna leave you

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.930
Don't wanna stay here

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.500
Don't wanna spend

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:49.440
Another day here

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.000
Ooh, I wanna split now

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:57.610
But I just can't quit now

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.160
You've really got a hold on me

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.700
- Really got a hold on me
- You got me

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:16.670
- You really got a hold on me
- You really got a hold on me

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.180
Hey, Peterson.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.890
I'm sorry.
I lost track of time.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:30.230
No problem.
I'm sure you were...

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.900
I mean,
I imagine you were...

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.400
Not that I was sitting here imagining
anything, because I wasn't.

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:41.530
- What time is it?
- it's a little after 4:00.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.450
I see. Fine.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:47.410
So, um, it's late, so let's
just go, okay, Brackett?

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.710
And, by the way, do you mind
if I drive, because...

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:54.630
Just because I'm the woman doesn't always
mean I wanna be the passenger, okay?

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:57.420
Peterson,
I didn't sleep with her.

01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:00.760
Excuse me. Did I ask you
if you slept with anybody?

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.930
No, no, no, no, no.
I just wanted you to know.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:09.430
Look, Brackett, however you choose to
get your information is your business.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.770
Did you lift her security pass
is all I wanna know.

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:13.770
- Well, I couldn't. She was all over me.
- Oh.

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.610
By the way, for the record,
not sleeping with her...

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:18.780
was maybe some of
the hardest work I've ever done.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.780
Do I look like your roommate?
I don't wanna hear this.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.990
You're right. I apologize.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.950
Now, please, sit down.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.620
I'm tired of sitting,
and I'm not thirsty.

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.830
Peterson, I've got us a lead.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.620
This is Kim's surprise party
last year.

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.790
The man with the gray hair
is Beekman.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.460
There's our friend Willy. And next to
him in the glasses is Alexander Hervey.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:43.470
Uh, who's Alexander Hervey?

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:47.510
He's a research scientist at Chess.
He and Beekman created LDF together.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.760
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:50.640
So where has he been during all this?

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:52.930
- Boulder City, Nevada.
- Nevada?

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.440
Mm-hmm.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.150
- You want some coffee?
- Not really. No.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:01.280
Well, okay, yeah. No.
Uh, yes. Half a cup.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.700
Doughnut?

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:11.370
Oh, no, thanks.
I try not to eat after 11:00.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.040
It's bad for your metabolism to
eat when your body's inactive.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:17.750
Plus I try to avoid saturated
fats, but you go ahead.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.050
So, what's in Nevada?

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.470
Hervey and Beekman worked on LDF
for ten years.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:34.640
At the end of the day,
LDF was a big hit and they were heroes.

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:38.730
Hervey was promoted and made the head
of a research facility outside of Vegas.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.360
- So he's sitting pretty.
- He was, but a couple of months ago...

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.030
he had a stroke, so he's pretty
much out of commission now.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:47.820
But the interesting thing is, Kim heard
Beekman was also offered a promotion...

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:49.990
but he turned it down.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.370
So he turns down a promotion,
quits his job...

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.620
and suddenly dies?

01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:01.040
Look, I realize that we're only
investigating together...

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:04.760
and we're trying to avoid coming
to any actual conclusions out loud.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.180
- However?
- However, it seems to me...

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.970
- that something wasn't kosher with LDF.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.260
And Willy must've gone
to Beekman and Hervey

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.390
and offered them promotions if they'd...

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.060
- Fake the test results?
- Is that what you think, Brackett?

01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:21.190
- Is that what you think, Peterson?
- I asked you first.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.570
- Yes.
- Me, too.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:25.110
I think Henley went along with
the plan, but Beekman refused.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.070
So he leaves Chess and takes
the real test results with him.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.530
- And just in case, sends a copy to his son.
- Exactly.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.160
Willy finds out, panics, and
calls in his old friend Vargas.

01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:38.250
You've turned into
a hell of a Hardy Boy, Peterson.

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.330
Besides the fact that these
people are trying to kill us...

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.590
how about the fact that they're
contaminating the country's milk supply?

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.050
Milk! Is nothing sacred?

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:49.380
Let's go!

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.100
Gimme the keys, Peterson.
You can drive next time.

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.990
What was that all about?
That guy was what? Tell me.

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:13.410
I don't know. Like, he was there then he
was gone. I don't know. I got spooked.

01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:17.540
Well, it's okay.
I'm dead anyway.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:21.350
Yes, you are.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.790
You two have somethin' that doesn't belong
to you, and I've been asked to take it back.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.510
Peterson, do you have somethin'
that doesn't belong to you?

01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:31.510
- No. Do you?
- Mmm. Sorry, we don't have it.

01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:36.220
Stay in this lane, boyfriend,
and keep it at 60.

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:44.150
So what's the plan?
Take us to some remote place,

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:46.320
kill us and make it look like an accident?

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.610
- Sounds good to me.
- Well, guess what?

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.450
Since I'm the designated driver,
screw your plan.

01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:58.450
What are you doing?

01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:04.670
Slow the car down,
or I'll smoke you right now!

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.210
Go ahead!

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.740
That's it!
Pull over!

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:38.870
Brackett!

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.000
Put your seat belt on,
Peterson.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.580
What are you, crazy?

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:15.070
- You're welcome.
- Should I Search him?

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.860
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:19.490
Then I wouldn't.

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:42.060
I think we took the wrong turn.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.820
Jeez! Oh!

01:19:56.950 --> 01:20:00.280
Perhaps this is
a blessing in disguise.

01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:03.540
- At least nobody knows where we are.
- Including us.

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:13.460
So, are we gonna go see
this Hervey character or what?

01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:16.720
Yeah. Sure.
Which way's Nevada?

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.260
What do you think that guy meant
when he asked...

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.470
if we had something
that didn't belong to us?

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.390
I don't know. Maybe Beekman's
test results weren't in the briefcase.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.610
But if we had them, why would we
still be on the story?

01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:35.780
Better question is, if they weren't
in the briefcase, where are they?

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.030
You aren't suggesting
I have them.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.660
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
Do you?

01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:47.960
- Wanna frisk me?
- No, not tonight, dear. I have a headache.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.460
Oops. I'm sorry.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.630
You sure you don't want
some sunscreen, Brackett?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.970
- it's paba-free.
- I'm fine, thank you.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.560
One out of every six Americans
gets skin cancer before the age of 65.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.810
You blonds have to be
especially careful.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.520
Peterson, do me a favor.
Quit givin' me advice.

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:13.020
First, I shouldn't eat bacon,
then saturated fat.

01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:17.030
If I'd eaten that saturated fat, I
wouldn't be starving to death right now.

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:20.860
Fine.
Don't wear sunscreen.

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:23.870
You know, I was just thinking. You know
where I'd be today if it weren't for you?

01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.830
- No, tell me.
- At the Beverly Hills Hotel...

01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:31.370
on my book tour, lounging around the pool,
giving interviews, gazing at Starlets.

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.380
You're not even embarrassed
to say that, are you?

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.960
Embarrassed? What do you think?
I'd rather be traipsing through poison ivy...

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:38.840
wearing a shirt on my head,
looking for hidden test results?

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:41.010
You think they're hidden?

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.470
You're actually having fun
on this story, aren't you?

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:48.100
You're not? I mean, I understand
your saying you're not...

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.560
but you're really not?

01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:53.810
Peterson, do I look like a man
having fun?

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:57.070
A man lounging around the Beverly Hills
Hotel ogling Starlets...

01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:59.070
looks to me like a man
not having fun.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.240
And furthermore, I think
you owe me an apology.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.570
In my opinion, meeting me was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.030
You could've quit this story
anytime you wanted, and you didn't...

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.740
because you and I both know
this is the story of our lives.

01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:11.790
No matter what you say, I know
you'd rather be an ace reporter...

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.040
than a second-rate
novelist.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.130
What is that?

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.220
What is what?

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:46.660
- Don't turn around. I'm getting out.
- Yeah?

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:57.330
I didn't think you'd be back so fast.
Don't turn.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.440
I won't.

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:03.090
- What's that?
- What?

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.400
- Uh-oh.
- She's naked.

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.980
- What?
- She's butt naked!

01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:23.360
Honey, we've been rescued.

01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:26.070
What are you doing?
Don't do this to me, please.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.620
Was I hearing things, or did you
call me a second-rate novelist?

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.160
I was, I was kidding. I,
I never even read your book.

01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:34.830
- I, I'm sure it's quite brilliant.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.580
- Oh! What are you doing? Walk backwards.
- You never read it, huh?

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:40.710
Boys! Hi, boys! Look!
A double-spotted platypus.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.960
They're very rare.
You're missing it.

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.430
When they said be prepared, I bet you
boys didn't expect anything like this.

01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:49.180
Only in our dreams.

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.560
Are you sure you never
read my book, Peterson?

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.850
- Okay, stop. I, I read it. I'm, I'm reading it.
- And?

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.520
It's cute.
Very cute.

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.520
I, I expected more,
to tell you the truth, but...

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:02.860
These nature walks are really
educational, huh, guys?

01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:06.740
Hey, I got a great idea!
Does anybody have a camera?

01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:17.460
Come on, you look great!

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.000
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this shirt!

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:22.960
I mean, we look like
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans!

01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:25.300
I mean, look at us.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.300
Brackett, they found us.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.050
Let's get outta here.

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:47.240
- Stop! Stop!
- Get out of the way.

01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:53.910
Go!
Move 'em out!

01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:58.250
Come on, Peterson!

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.710
This way! This way!

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.420
Brackett, through here.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:13.890
Ooh!

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.640
We don't see
many of those anymore.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:20.190
Congratulations.
Right this way.

01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:22.690
- You kids next?
- Us?

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.150
- Yes! Yes! Yes, we are. We're next.
- isn't this rather sudden?

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.990
Come, come, come.
Don't be shy.

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:31.820
My name is Ray. I'll be conducting
the service this evening.

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:33.870
Please take a position
in front of the podium...

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:38.000
and I'll acquaint you with the
accoutrement we have at our disposal.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.170
We have flowers, fresh or silk.

01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:46.550
We have rings, veil, tux,
yarmulke, if you so desire.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:49.630
- Music, prerecorded or live...
- We'll take the works.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.430
Yes. The works, Sandra.

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:57.390
Spare no expense on such
a marvelous and holy occasion.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.770
That's a 42,
and it looks like a winner.

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:04.270
Please place this
on the apex of the skull.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.480
Very good.
Would you folks prefer the...

01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:09.280
long or the abridged service
this evening?

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.650
Uh, just do us a favor.
Just go through the motions. Uh...

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.910
- Just start.
- Just start? Why don't we just start?

01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:16.910
Sandra, if you will.
I'll need your names.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.740
- Peterson.
- Brackett.

01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:23.710
Peterson, you and Brackett
have decided to unite your love.

01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:28.550
May you cherish
this sacred moment...

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.260
forever.
Rings.

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:35.680
As I ask Brackett...

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.680
do you take Peterson
to be your wedded wife...

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:41.430
promising to cherish
and protect her...

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.100
be it in good fortune
and adversity?

01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:45.850
- Is he here?
- Yes!

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.940
Yes? And do you take Brackett
to be your wedded husband...

01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:52.900
promising to cherish
and protect him...

01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:55.610
be it in good fortune
and adversity?

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:57.660
If he comes any closer,
we're out the rear exit.

01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:58.830
Okay.

01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:01.540
Okay. And so,
by the powers vested in me...

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.910
by the great state of Nevada...

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.920
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.000
Mazeltov.

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:23.230
I'm Coming up empty
on this guy Vargas.

01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.520
And your friend Sam
called twice.

01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:28.310
He said that he can't find
anybody who knew him at Yale.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.440
Oh, how's Peterson?
ls she still driving you crazy?

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.570
More than you can imagine.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.160
- Anything?
- Not yet.

01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:46.000
- You hungry?
- Yeah, a little.

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.940
Thanks.

01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:55.550
To the bravest girl I ever met.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.930
Why? Because I've managed
to stay alive?

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:01.050
Oh, no, no!
Because you married me.

01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:15.740
Am I really looking
at a heart-shaped turkey burger?

01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:21.780
You know, if anyone told me two weeks
ago I'd be married to Peter Brackett"

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:24.080
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.
I already checked.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.960
We can have it annulled
in the morning.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:30.540
Oh, you did?
Good.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:35.050
Well, a 12-hour marriage.
Even shorter than my first one.

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.010
Peterson,
you were married before?

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.430
You find that so hard
to imagine?

01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:45.470
No, no. I'm just sort of particular
about who my wives have been married to.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.980
- Who was he?
- Name's O'Connor.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:52.690
Of Peterson, Peterson
and O'Connor.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.820
He's extremely close
with my parents.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.530
- Well, you've been married before, right?
- I tried it briefly.

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.820
Didn't like it?

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:03.160
No, actually it was my wife
who had the complaint.

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:07.120
She said I was never home. She said
I loved newspapering more than her...

01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:11.000
She said she'd never mean as much to
you as the story you were working on.

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:14.000
- She said she was jealous of the boys...
- In the City room.

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:15.300
- Yeah!
- Funny.

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:16.460
Yeah.

01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:21.050
She's now married to a brilliant
CPA with an amazing sweater collection.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:24.010
- Bet he's home every night.
- Like clockwork.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.520
- That's what they like.
- Regularity.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680
Yeah.

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.690
You know, Brackett...

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.260
some guys...

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.870
might try to take advantage of
a situation like this, but not you.

01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:47.430
No, no.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:51.500
I know this is the one area...

01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:54.540
- where I can completely trust you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:58.880
So, which side of the heart
do you want?

01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:02.050
- We're sleeping in shifts. Remember?
- Yeah, right. I forgot.

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.260
- Um, you want to take the first shift?
- No, no, you go ahead.

01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:06.430
Mmm.

01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:31.620
Tell me something, Brackett.

01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:36.710
What is it about me
you don't like?

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.920
I'm not pretty enough?

01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:41.970
Not tall enough?
Too tall?

01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:45.930
Too smart?
Not smart enough?

01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:49.100
Wrong color hair?

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.730
Talk too much?

01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:54.270
Really, what is it?

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.610
I've never had this effect
on a man before.

01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:00.860
You would be surprised, but...

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:06.320
most men are actually
somewhat attracted to me.

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:10.790
I know you think I'm trouble,
and you curse the day you met me...

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:15.000
but off the record, I don't feel
that way about you...

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:16.570
at all.

01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:27.050
Off the record, Peterson...

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.890
I don't feel that way
about you, either...

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.460
at all.

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.060
You don't?

01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:53.200
First time I ever kissed
a newspaperman.

01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:55.370
I like it.

01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:03.460
This doesn't change anything.
I'm still the Globe, and you're still...

01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:07.340
The Chronicle.
I know, Sabrina, I know.

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:11.260
- We're still...
- Competitors.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.640
Thank you
for calling me Sabrina.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.200
- Hello?
- This is Mrs. Hervey.

01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:33.580
If you want to see my husband,
please come now.

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:37.750
This is exactly the sort of thing that
would've driven my ex-husband crazy.

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:41.670
Your current husband's not
too thrilled about it, either.

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.800
- Well...
- Yeah.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.960
Yeah.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.510
Oh, hey, don't forget
your wallet.

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:11.790
Shall we?

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.580
Sure.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.660
My husband's home now
because there's nothing more

01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:22.460
they can do for him at the hospital.

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:26.050
But some days
he's not all that bad.

01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:31.220
Alex, the reporters from Chicago
are here to see you.

01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:34.510
Alex?

01:33:40.730 --> 01:33:41.730
Alex.

01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:47.820
Alex, they've come
such a long way to see you.

01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:54.240
You wanted to talk to my husband
about, um, Darryl Beekman, didn't you?

01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:58.250
Mm-hmm. Yes, we were wondering
why, a-after the success of LDF...

01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:01.000
that your husband
was given a promotion...

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.290
but Dr. Beekman chose
to leave the company?

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:08.460
Were you wondering, Mr. Brackett,
or do you think you know?

01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:11.420
We think we know. We just need
someone to tell us if we're right.

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:14.510
Did your husband ever say
anything about Dr. Beekman...

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.180
about disagreements
between them?

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.550
Never.

01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:22.310
I... I'm sorry. I w... I was hoping
Alex could talk to you.

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.270
I sensed that he wanted to.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.200
Uh, uh, excuse me. Can I use
your restroom for a second?

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.990
- Down the hall.
- Oh, thank you.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.990
I'm sorry you had to come
such a long way.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.420
I really appreciate you calling
us, Mrs. Hervey. Thank you.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.670
Maybe we should wait
until Mr. Brackett gets back.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.420
No, no, that's okay.

01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:53.800
Uh, I really don't know
what it is, but...

01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:57.350
I thought it was strange,
because in 30 years...

01:34:57.510 --> 01:35:01.470
I've never seen Alex bring
anything home from work.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:09.020
You can take it, but I'm afraid it's
not much use to anyone outside of Chess.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.400
Thank you.

01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.560
This is Captain Riley. Just to let
you know that we're ahead of schedule...

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.310
and we'll be arriving in Chicago
in just a little under an hour.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.730
The temperature is e breezy
34 degrees with clear skies.

01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:59.280
- Sorry.
- No problem.

01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:02.540
Complimentary champagne
for the bride and groom?

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.410
I can always spot the newlyweds
on our Vegas flights.

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.920
Of course with you two,
who couldn't?

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.380
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:19.390
So, what should we drink to?

01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:24.640
- Our annulment?
- Perfect!

01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:28.190
Because, truthfully, Brackett, there's not a
man in the world I'd rather annul than you.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.940
Truthfully, Peterson, I wouldn't
believe anything you ever said...

01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:35.860
that started with
the word "truthfully."

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.580
Well, I guess it's time
to put an end to the Charade.

01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:52.920
Yeah. Gimbel's marries Macy's.
We wouldn't want that to get around.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.930
- May I?
- Mmm.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:23.280
Will you do something for me,
Peterson, for old times' sake?

01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:26.490
What?

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.040
Kiss me good-bye.

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:23.380
Back now, 7:30 on this, uh,
Monday morning, October the 14th.

01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:26.600
I'm Bryant Gumbel here in Studio 3B.
Katie Couric's up on Capitol...

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.310
What happened to October 13th?

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.530
Let's go.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.960
Uh, I'm here
for the 4:00 tour.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.630
In beautiful
Spring Creek, Wisconsin.

01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:57.750
Our first stop
on today's tour...

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.130
is going to be the Chess Family
Science Discovery Center.

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:05.840
Now, as we walk in pairs down
the Biology of Tomorrow corridor...

01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:08.850
Right this way, sir.
How are you folks today?

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:14.350
I'd like to point out a few of the
everyday products created here at Chess.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.900
For example, the cold medicine
which I forgot to take this morning.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.490
- Hi.
- Milk, e staple for the entire family.

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.450
And just one of the products
Chess Chemical is working to improve...

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.160
- for the 21st century.
- You know, you look very familiar.

01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.370
Have we met before?

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:38.290
No. Actually this is my first
visit to the Twilight Zone.

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.960
- Why'd you double-cross me, Peterson?
- Just following the Golden Rule.

01:39:42.130 --> 01:39:44.630
But I thought we were partners,
five-oh, five-oh.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.550
That must explain why you took
Kim's security pass.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.300
- Oh, Peterson, I was gonna...
- "l was gonna tell you."

01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:51.600
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.520
I was gonna tell you, Peterson.
I took it as a backup.

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.810
- I never thought we'd be here again.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.570
- Look, I gotta go.
- Peterson, listen.

01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:02.650
It's not safe for you
to be here alone.

01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.030
Now, you probably don't wanna be
reminded of this...

01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:08.570
but I did take an oath to protect you
'til death do us part.

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.490
Game's over, Brackett,
and you lose.

01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.580
I've got the disk.
I've got the security pass.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.910
Actually, I have the disk.

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.460
Actually, that's blank.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:19.880
I've got the disk.
I've got my own security pass.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.340
And I've got the authority
to have you thrown out of here.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.510
Sabrina. Honey, come on.

01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:28.300
After all we've been through!

01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:32.310
Just do in your heart what you know
I would do if I was in your position.

01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:36.310
Okay.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.980
Sam, stop!
I don't want to hear.

01:40:43.150 --> 01:40:45.860
I'm not interested in Vargas anymore.
I'm off the story.

01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:48.200
- Peterson, too?
- No, no, no. She's still on it.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.530
You know, the girl is nuts!

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.740
She went undercover
as a Chess tour guide.

01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:52.910
You're kidding!

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.580
I'm serious.
She got a job there.

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.660
Pete, look, look, there 's more
I wanna tell you, okay?

01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:59.120
No, Sam, don't tempt me!
I'm not gonna get killed on a story

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:00.540
where I don't even get the girl.

01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:03.540
I'm goin' back on my book tour.
I'll be in Seattle by dinner.

01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:05.960
In a few hours, this whole thing
will be a distant memory.

01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:08.130
Okay, don't worry about it, buddy.
And good luck on the tour.

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.800
Thanks for everything, man.

01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:17.140
You need to have a little chat
with your personnel director.

01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:20.230
Sabrina Peterson's
working at Chess.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.400
Oh, Jesus.

01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:27.030
He ain't gonna help us.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.750
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:46.050
We hope you have enjoyed your tour, and
remember, no matter where you may live...

01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:50.300
Chess Chemical is your neighbor,
striving for a better tomorrow today.

01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:52.430
Thank you very much.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.480
Excuse me.
Does this plane have a phone?

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.650
Straight ahead on the cabin wall, but you
really need to stay in your seat, sir.

01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:05.690
- We're about to take off.
- Okay, thanks.

01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:24.080
- What city, please?
- Uh, Madison.

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:25.380
The number of the capitol building.

01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:29.170
- That's 555-4331.
- Thank you.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.430
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be taking off momentarily.

01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:36.800
Flight attendants,
please prepare for departure.

01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:39.310
- Good evening. State Capitol.
- Yeah, Sam Smotherman.

01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:42.480
Mr. Smotherman.
That's extension 307.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.750
Keep it movin'.
Keep comin'.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.460
Fine. Hold it right there.
Okay.

01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:18.260
- How you doin', Jack?
- Okay, Bob. How are you?

01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:21.090
Jesus! God!

01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.510
What are these...
Oh, Jesus!

01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:54.920
Too bad. But a definite "A"
for effort, Peterson.

01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:59.970
Or should I call you Brackett,
Mrs. Brackett? Hmm?

01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:01.880
I don't really care what
you call me, Smotherman.

01:46:02.050 --> 01:46:05.760
Or should I call you
Ernesto, Mr. Vargas?

01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:07.730
Oh, darn!

01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:10.980
I wanted to be the one
to tell you.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:13.230
You did!
A cop once told me...

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.730
"Always look for the lie; that's when
the story begins to unravel."

01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.440
When I asked you what year you graduated,
you gave me two different years.

01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:22.450
I wondered why, so I looked
you up in your yearbook.

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:27.370
Funny thing was, you weren't in it,
not under the name Smotherman, anyway.

01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:34.790
We were hoping you had what
we were looking for, but...

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.130
since you don't have it,
and we don't have it...

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.800
we can assume
it didn't survive the crash.

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.470
So now the only evidence
to destroy is you.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:47.470
Oh, and your husband,
of course.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.430
Fortunately,
we know exactly where he is.

01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.820
- What's going on, Ted?
- Oh, Mr. Chess,

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.490
I didn't know anyone was in here.

01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:03.700
We've got an alert
down at the loading dock.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:07.450
- Go back to your station. I'll deal with it.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:11.620
Get out there.
See what's going on.

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.330
How'd you get involved
in this, Sam?

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.340
Willy wanted to get rid of Beekman, and
he thought you could get the job done?

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.670
- Something like that.
- But you botched the fire in college.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.970
What made him think
you'd get it right this time?

01:47:25.130 --> 01:47:26.840
I was the only bad guy he knew.

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:31.720
Did he pay you to hook up
with Senator Robbins?

01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:34.480
Think I could afford
steak dinners if he didn't'?

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.560
Do me a favor, Peterson.

01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:38.530
Sit down.

01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:01.880
Stay with her, and watch her.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.160
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
It seems...

01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:45.590
It seems we've got a traffic jam
in the parking lot.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.260
I'm in no rush. As long as
we've got a couple of minutes...

01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:51.260
What?
You want an interview?

01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:55.270
Why not? Give a dying girl
her last wish.

01:48:55.430 --> 01:49:00.400
Why'd you do it, Willy? Why not just
admit LDF was a flop and move on?

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.940
For ten years, Beekman and Hervey
promised me they'd iron out the kinks.

01:49:05.110 --> 01:49:09.110
A hundred million dollars later,
they apologized, said they were wrong.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.660
By then it was too late. I mortgaged our
company's future in this thing. It had to fly!

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:16.000
What were these kinks, exactly?

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.290
Well, let's put it this way. You can't
put a label on a carton of milk:

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:22.920
"This product has been known
to cause cancer in laboratory animals."

01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:26.630
- And Beekman was gonna blow the whistle.
- Can you imagine?

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.220
The guy screws up and then he tries to bite
the hand that feeds him? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:50.150
All right, that's it. I've had it.
Just get her out. Now!

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.030
- Willy, let's go.
- Where's he gonna take me, Sam?

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.620
- At least tell me how he's gonna do it, huh?
- No comment.

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:58.160
Another train crash?
Another fire?

01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:00.620
Hey, maybe I'll get it the
old-fashioned way like Danny Brown.

01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:04.130
Come on, Sam, you're the organ grinder
here! Tell me how this ape's gonna do it.

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.710
- Why not just show her, Mando?
- Brackett!

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.590
Brackett.

01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:15.970
You got her? Just get her.
Stop shooting!

01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:19.100
Lock the gates.
Don't let anyone in.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.960
Peterson, I thought
you were one of them!

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:46.000
It's okay.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:50.510
What'd you come back for,
Brackett, me or the story?

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.180
- Mostly you, Peterson.
- Mostly me?

01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:58.260
He's on the third tier!

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.080
Nice try, Mando.
Drop the gun.

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:07.580
Why? Are you going to shoot me
with your finger, Brackett?

01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:09.920
There's only one way
to find out.

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:54.460
Any time you want to jump in,
Peterson.

01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:16.650
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:32.830
Oh, Jesus.

01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:46.010
Oh, Jesus!

01:54:05.370 --> 01:54:09.460
My mother always said, you want
the job done right, do it yourself.

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.290
Whoa. Whoa.

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.470
- Peterson!
- Self-defense classes.

01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:22.050
A must for a woman in the '90s.

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.620
Uh-huh.

01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:28.810
- Stay there or I'll shoot.
- I don't think so.

01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.270
Think again.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:19.360
Mrs. Brackett,
you had it all the time.

01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.280
Uh-uh-uh.
Don't touch.

01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:35.420
Hey, Pete, do you mind
if I kill your wife?

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:38.710
As a matter of fact, I do.
Hang on, Peterson!

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.900
Grab on!

01:56:03.650 --> 01:56:06.320
I got it! I got it.

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.070
Atta girl.

01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:25.550
"As Vargas shouted
his final command...

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:28.890
the Thin Man's eyes
measured Peterson for a coffin.

01:56:29.050 --> 01:56:32.640
She turned, a breath away from
the barrel of his .22 automatic."

01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:36.180
Poetry, sweetheart.
Absolute poetry!

01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:40.860
Look who's talking. "The cold metal tip
of the pistol brushed against my hair.

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.900
I looked up at the assassin. His eyes
were empty as two holes in a mask."

01:56:46.570 --> 01:56:49.360
Honey, I got goose bumps!

01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:52.280
You ever think
of writing a novel?

01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:54.540
And give up the newspaper game?
Never.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.660
Okay!

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.170
Well, I might give it a try again.
Here's my idea.

01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:10.340
- Mmm.
- Male, female reporters solve mystery...

01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:11.760
- fight...
- Mm-hmm.

01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:14.010
Make up, fall in love...

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.480
save the day,
go on a honeymoon.

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.390
Sounds like a best-seller
to me.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.360
- Darling.
- Yes, my love?

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:28.240
You didn't really mean it when you said our
scoundrel days were behind us, did you?

01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:36.790
They are for me
if they are for you.

01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:40.120
All right. I promise
to go straight if you do.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000

01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:48.880
Then I do too.

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.140

01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:09.610

01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.490

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:18.990
Uh-uh.
