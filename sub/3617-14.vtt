Yeah, but I kind of liked his
whole world-without-magic
speech.

actually considering it.

the future of my niece.

now? No powers, no Book , no
Elders.

Piper and the baby are
vulnerable.

- Okay, fine.

But if there's a meeting,
we're going in heavy
in case it's a trap.

23:43.626 --> 23:47.442
- Okay, but Cronyn
said no weapons.
- And you trust him?

23:47.542 --> 23:50.899

saltpeter and cayenne pepper
from the kitchen.

- A homemade arsenal.

get an aerosol can?

- You have hairspray.

Yeah, but mine is non-aerosol,
and it's a really big meeting,

25:02.667 --> 25:05.899

- Check my bathroom.
- Great.
