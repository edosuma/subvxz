00:06.984 --> 00:09.117
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

00:09.152 --> 00:10.251
Why are you here?

00:10.287 --> 00:13.054
I believe I'm cursed to see things.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.956
If you think you are touched by the demon

00:14.992 --> 00:16.691
then you best walk out that door.

00:16.727 --> 00:17.926
The man concerns me.

00:17.961 --> 00:19.344
She has a protector.

00:19.379 --> 00:20.795
Mr. Chandler?

00:20.797 --> 00:21.963
Lupus Dei.

00:22.015 --> 00:23.331
He shall be your challenge, daughter.

00:23.967 --> 00:25.634
I want to know who did this to you.

00:25.686 --> 00:28.236
Get better, Mr. Roper. We
have much to talk about.

00:28.271 --> 00:29.771
My name is Dorian Gray.

00:29.806 --> 00:31.973
Angelique. This is where I work.

00:32.009 --> 00:33.675
I hope you know what you've bought.

00:33.710 --> 00:34.859
I do.

00:35.896 --> 00:38.580
Cosmetically, she is transformed.

00:38.615 --> 00:40.115
Lily, may I introduce...

00:40.150 --> 00:41.316
John Clare.

00:41.351 --> 00:43.151
Come and meet the new man we've hired.

00:43.203 --> 00:44.486
It is good to meet you.

00:44.538 --> 00:47.222
That face will make our fortune.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.130
- Mrs. Poole.
- Sir Malcolm.

00:55.165 --> 00:56.965
- What do they know?
- Nothing.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.834
I can misdirect them as you see fit.

00:59.886 --> 01:02.937
No. Let her follow the bread crumbs to me.

01:04.424 --> 01:06.675
You have to learn to protect yourself.

01:06.727 --> 01:08.810
- From whom?
- Legions.

01:09.896 --> 01:11.346
- Remember this.
- No!

01:11.398 --> 01:13.815
When Lucifer fell, he did not fall alone.

01:13.850 --> 01:17.719
They will hunt you until the end of days.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.086 --> 02:57.185
And then?

03:01.191 --> 03:02.757
They burned her alive.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.343
When I left the moors,

03:22.379 --> 03:25.914
I thought I would never hear
that wicked language again.

03:25.949 --> 03:27.315
Or confront that evil.

03:30.187 --> 03:33.087
Mr. Chandler felt you needed to know.

03:33.123 --> 03:34.155
"For thee are not fighting

03:34.191 --> 03:36.591
against flesh-and-blood enemies...

03:36.660 --> 03:39.494
but against mighty powers
in this dark realm."

03:39.529 --> 03:42.497
"And against evil spirits
in heavenly places."

03:46.419 --> 03:49.087
So these Nightcomers practice
a form of black magic,

03:49.139 --> 03:50.388
while you practice a form of...

03:50.423 --> 03:52.140
Practicing any form of
magic is unbelievable enough,

03:52.175 --> 03:53.174
do we need to parse it?

03:53.226 --> 03:55.009
We need to know what these things are.

03:55.061 --> 03:57.061
Yes, they're witches, understood.

03:57.097 --> 03:58.980
Witchcraft has a long history
in many cultures, Doctor,

03:59.015 --> 04:00.064
as well you know.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.650
As do fairies and sprites,
but they don't walk about

04:01.702 --> 04:04.953
- Greater London, do they?
- These do.

04:08.158 --> 04:09.324
My apologies.

04:11.111 --> 04:12.293
And their goal?

04:13.496 --> 04:15.663
They're servants to the Devil.

04:15.699 --> 04:18.031
Doing his bidding to
serve their own ends...

04:19.269 --> 04:21.101
whatever those may be.

04:22.956 --> 04:24.756
All of which leaves us where, exactly?

04:24.791 --> 04:26.841
A threat to which we can now give a name.

04:28.044 --> 04:29.510
And a language we need to decipher.

04:32.966 --> 04:34.599
Oh. I'm on.

04:34.634 --> 04:36.384
Take a look, won't you?

04:44.361 --> 04:47.312
Mr. Chandler was more right than he knew.

04:47.364 --> 04:48.897
It is a puzzle.

04:48.949 --> 04:50.899
And more complicated
than it first appeared,

04:50.901 --> 04:53.735
which just about gave me
the vapors, I can tell you.

04:53.737 --> 04:56.487
It's not so much an actual language

04:56.539 --> 04:59.240
as a collection of known languages

04:59.292 --> 05:00.909
forming new patterns.

05:00.961 --> 05:03.828
But within this thicket of obfuscation,

05:03.880 --> 05:06.247
our old friends Greek and Latin.

05:06.249 --> 05:08.082
Translating the Greek was easy enough,

05:08.134 --> 05:11.586
though the idiom is decidedly pre-grammar,

05:11.638 --> 05:12.754
if you will.

05:13.556 --> 05:17.258
And one fragment... emerged to me, here.

05:21.982 --> 05:26.684
"So God looked down on His
defeated angels and... "

05:29.105 --> 05:30.772
That "and" suggests what?

05:30.824 --> 05:32.657
- More to come.
- Precisely.

05:32.692 --> 05:34.993
So I started hunting
for the continuation...

05:35.028 --> 05:37.779
and I found this, in Latin.

05:37.831 --> 05:39.514
So, Mr. Chandler, care to test your skill?

05:40.667 --> 05:42.216
"Found them to be evil angels,

05:42.252 --> 05:44.702
so He cast them out. He took... "

05:46.289 --> 05:47.388
Took what?

05:47.424 --> 05:48.890
Aren't you all dying to know?

05:48.925 --> 05:50.425
It's a story.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.960
A narrative that continues.

05:51.962 --> 05:53.928
Language to language.

05:53.964 --> 05:56.431
Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic

05:56.466 --> 05:58.132
to 10 other obscure
languages and pictographs,

05:58.168 --> 06:00.802
changing language from relic to relic.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.470
Is it the story of Lucifer, then?

06:02.522 --> 06:03.938
The angel cast out by God?

06:03.974 --> 06:05.106
Time will tell.

06:05.141 --> 06:07.275
How could this one monk
know all these languages?

06:07.310 --> 06:10.812
- He didn't. The demon did.
- Exactly.

06:10.864 --> 06:11.980
Recall, Brother Gregory

06:11.982 --> 06:14.365
was only writing down what he heard,

06:14.401 --> 06:16.868
apparently in whatever
language it came to him.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.989
Do you know what I think this is?

06:22.292 --> 06:23.541
Yes, I think it's a story.

06:23.576 --> 06:25.743
But you made one mistake
in your translation,

06:25.795 --> 06:27.662
Mr. Chandler, more than understandable

06:27.664 --> 06:29.998
given the archaic script and usage.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.466
Look again.

06:33.753 --> 06:34.736
Not "them... "

06:36.039 --> 06:37.271
"us."

06:37.307 --> 06:40.808
"Found us to be evil
angels, so He cast us out."

06:40.844 --> 06:42.710
It's not just a story.

06:44.481 --> 06:45.646
It's an autobiography.

06:47.901 --> 06:49.901
The memoirs of the Devil.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.993
This is all giving me a headache.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.863
You should talk to a doctor.

07:04.084 --> 07:07.168
You know, once I would have thought

07:07.203 --> 07:09.203
all of this impossible.

07:09.205 --> 07:11.089
And now?

07:11.124 --> 07:12.790
I know nothing's impossible.

07:12.842 --> 07:15.009
Whatever we can imagine, far worse is true.

07:15.545 --> 07:18.012
- And far better.
- You think so?

07:18.882 --> 07:20.748
I choose to.

07:23.386 --> 07:24.919
Miss Ives, I've a...

07:26.056 --> 07:27.622
personal favor to ask of you.

07:29.025 --> 07:31.642
Would you mind accompanying
me somewhere tomorrow?

07:31.694 --> 07:33.811
On, well...

07:35.949 --> 07:38.366
an errand of sorts.

07:39.119 --> 07:40.234
Of course, Doctor.

07:40.286 --> 07:42.904
- May I call at 10:00?
- Gladly.

07:42.939 --> 07:44.288
Thank you.

08:05.678 --> 08:06.928
What are you doing?

08:08.398 --> 08:09.647
Watching.

08:11.101 --> 08:12.266
For what?

08:13.069 --> 08:17.105
Those things that hunt at night.

08:19.909 --> 08:21.309
Lions.

09:18.251 --> 09:20.501
The train stops in the tunnel.

09:23.506 --> 09:25.406
The lights go out for a brief moment.

09:27.043 --> 09:30.678
No one in the carriages on
either side saw anything.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.930
No one came and no one went.

09:35.401 --> 09:36.984
So how did he do it?

09:38.071 --> 09:41.155
- Sir?
- How did he come and go?

09:43.109 --> 09:45.943
Carrying a baby, no less...

09:45.995 --> 09:48.863
which apparently didn't
squall or cry out in transit.

09:49.949 --> 09:52.700
- Perhaps he killed it here.
- Then why take it?

09:57.140 --> 10:00.675
And the wounds... like a surgeon.

10:02.212 --> 10:04.128
Precise and elegant...

10:07.634 --> 10:10.618
unlike the other animal
butchery we've seen.

10:22.482 --> 10:25.066
No, we're going about this all wrong.

10:27.237 --> 10:29.954
We're pursuing patterns of logic...

10:31.708 --> 10:33.674
when the answer lies elsewhere.

10:34.944 --> 10:35.977
Where?

10:41.084 --> 10:42.350
Magic.

10:46.639 --> 10:50.174
Evening Star! Mother and father killed!

10:55.148 --> 10:57.682
And how are we to afford
another exhibition?

10:57.734 --> 10:59.934
It'll pay for itself in time.

10:59.986 --> 11:01.602
What makes you think that Harry Public's

11:01.638 --> 11:04.605
going to plunk down two bob
to see those bloody things?

11:04.657 --> 11:07.241
Go to the corner right
now, you'll find the answer.

11:08.077 --> 11:09.610
They line up three deep

11:09.646 --> 11:11.612
for the Police Gazette
and the penny dreadfuls.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.998
And those are only pictures.

11:14.033 --> 11:15.783
We give 'em it fully formed.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.453
Horror in all its horror.

11:20.673 --> 11:22.790
Yeah, time will prove it, eh?

11:23.926 --> 11:27.094
A husband could use a show
of support from his wife.

11:31.384 --> 11:35.052
Besides, with this, we're
not simulating anything...

11:35.104 --> 11:36.971
because it's all real.

11:36.973 --> 11:40.524
Flesh and blood and pumping hearts and all.

11:41.811 --> 11:43.277
Here. Look at this.

11:49.569 --> 11:52.987
We add another entrance
here, at the corner.

11:53.039 --> 11:57.425
Two attractions, two
gates... two admissions.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.161
Give 'em a discount for buying both.

12:02.165 --> 12:03.714
They go down the stairs here.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.666
I don't follow. Where are you keeping them?

12:05.668 --> 12:06.717
In this half of the cellar,

12:06.753 --> 12:08.919
if I can rent it off the tobacconist.

12:08.971 --> 12:10.054
You see?

12:10.089 --> 12:12.306
You're going to keep them
in the cellar? All the time?

12:12.342 --> 12:14.342
Of course.

12:14.377 --> 12:16.260
They don't need the light.

12:16.846 --> 12:18.646
They're freaks.

12:56.102 --> 12:58.119
I know you're there.

13:01.591 --> 13:02.823
Sorry, Miss.

13:02.859 --> 13:04.558
Everyone does it.

13:04.594 --> 13:07.495
A chance to observe
life at its most natural,

13:07.530 --> 13:08.763
being unobserved.

13:09.932 --> 13:11.599
I can always tell.

13:11.634 --> 13:13.734
The molecules change in the air, you see.

13:14.804 --> 13:16.570
Everything vibrates.

13:18.341 --> 13:20.658
Oh, I'll... I'll go.

13:21.878 --> 13:24.378
Mr. Clare, don't be such a mouse.

13:25.915 --> 13:27.415
Now, tell me...

13:28.918 --> 13:30.918
does this look like Mr. Gladstone?

13:31.971 --> 13:33.637
He's been Prime Minister so many times

13:33.673 --> 13:36.023
we have to keep making him older.

13:37.643 --> 13:39.427
I think he does.

13:39.479 --> 13:40.928
Aging them is easy.

13:42.098 --> 13:43.597
Everyone knows you have to add wrinkles

13:43.649 --> 13:45.766
and sagging skin and such...

13:48.070 --> 13:51.188
but the trick... is the eyes.

13:52.825 --> 13:55.443
They get cloudy as you get older.

13:55.445 --> 13:57.278
You have to change the eyes.

13:58.614 --> 14:00.498
What do your eyes look like?

14:02.618 --> 14:03.834
Um...

14:06.956 --> 14:09.590
They're not beautiful.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.041
Are they cloudy?

14:12.462 --> 14:13.511
No.

14:14.597 --> 14:17.181
What color are they? No. Let me guess.

14:17.216 --> 14:19.099
- Miss...
- Blue?

14:19.135 --> 14:21.519
No, you're no blue-eyed boy.

14:21.554 --> 14:23.604
Not green, I sense.

14:24.357 --> 14:26.640
I'll say brown.

14:26.642 --> 14:29.443
Feathery brown like an owl's wing.

14:31.347 --> 14:33.614
No, not brown.

14:33.649 --> 14:35.316
Well, tell me.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.051
They're...

14:39.789 --> 14:42.039
yellow.

14:42.074 --> 14:43.991
Well, that makes a change!

14:44.043 --> 14:47.328
Not a lemon yellow, I hope.
That would be alarming.

14:48.581 --> 14:50.798
More of a turmeric, would you say?

14:53.402 --> 14:55.169
Yes.

14:57.340 --> 15:00.074
I heard the most wonderful
story about Mr. Gladstone.

15:00.927 --> 15:04.178
That almost every evening
he goes out walking...

15:04.180 --> 15:05.846
and if he comes across a fallen woman

15:05.898 --> 15:08.849
he stops and talks to
her and gives her money.

15:10.152 --> 15:11.685
A very kind man.

15:12.522 --> 15:13.821
Anyone who's kind to the suffering

15:13.856 --> 15:16.156
deserves a proper place
in the museum, I say.

15:18.227 --> 15:20.694
And what about the others you work on?

15:20.746 --> 15:21.996
Which?

15:23.499 --> 15:25.366
Those that aren't kind.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.169
Yes.

15:29.205 --> 15:31.589
Father's murderers.

15:31.624 --> 15:34.508
All those figures screaming
in his new crime scenes.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.546
Ah, Mr. Clare...

15:39.765 --> 15:41.515
it hurts me to create them.

15:42.552 --> 15:45.019
Like I'm bringing them to
life and then torturing them.

15:45.054 --> 15:48.188
Like some sort of terrible
African voodoo doll.

15:50.026 --> 15:53.143
They're all fresh when they
come out of the molds...

15:53.195 --> 15:55.062
and then I make them suffer.

15:56.449 --> 15:58.816
Some people think that's what life is.

16:00.570 --> 16:02.403
Born fresh to suffer.

16:03.656 --> 16:05.339
Do you think that?

16:06.108 --> 16:08.108
Uh... I did.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.479
Now I'm not sure.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.550
There's hope for you anyway.

16:18.254 --> 16:19.987
Don't give up on life just yet.

16:23.059 --> 16:24.558
No, Miss, I won't.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.113
Family murder on the Underground!

16:46.165 --> 16:47.581
Baby missing!

16:52.455 --> 16:54.121
Family murdered.

16:55.374 --> 16:56.874
All horrors on the Underground!

16:56.926 --> 16:58.375
Read about it.

17:06.018 --> 17:07.550
Thank you, sir.

17:51.147 --> 17:54.014
- Are you all right, Miss?
- Why... I...

17:55.685 --> 17:57.484
It's all right.

17:58.988 --> 18:00.354
It's okay. You're...

18:04.276 --> 18:06.910
Come on, now. It's all right.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.039
I understand your memory

18:19.091 --> 18:21.208
may not be completely clear, Mr. Roper.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.509
I'll take that into account.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.965
Will you describe what
happened at the Mariner's Inn?

18:35.891 --> 18:37.024
Anything you can remember

18:37.059 --> 18:39.426
would be a boon to my investigation.

18:48.537 --> 18:50.604
With your help...

18:50.639 --> 18:52.940
we can find the man who did this to you.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.777
I don't remember.

18:59.148 --> 19:00.347
Nothing?

19:04.386 --> 19:07.671
- I find that hard to credit.
- Credit what you like.

19:13.345 --> 19:14.728
The pathologists tell me your wounds

19:14.764 --> 19:18.315
were likely inflicted by
some sort of animal claw.

19:19.301 --> 19:23.437
Perhaps a tomahawk or ritual
club from your own country.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.273
I don't remember.

19:29.695 --> 19:32.679
Then perhaps you can remember
why you were wearing this.

19:35.117 --> 19:36.350
Protection.

19:37.419 --> 19:38.819
From what?

19:45.161 --> 19:46.560
Mr. Roper.

19:46.595 --> 19:49.379
My city is choked with bodies.

19:49.431 --> 19:51.098
A baby is missing.

19:52.101 --> 19:57.054
You will help me, or by God,
I will grind you to bone.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.948
I am a citizen of the
United States of America.

20:07.983 --> 20:09.183
I know my rights.

20:10.152 --> 20:12.753
Soon as I'm able, I'll be
gone from your goddamn city,

20:12.788 --> 20:14.721
you can be assured.

20:37.229 --> 20:40.514
Honestly, Doctor, this is
the last thing I expected.

20:40.566 --> 20:42.015
Yes, well...

20:43.485 --> 20:45.252
what's life without surprises?

20:58.334 --> 21:00.667
It's my cousin, you see,
she's coming to visit me

21:00.703 --> 21:04.037
and she's a simple girl,
not slow, you understand,

21:04.089 --> 21:06.206
not retarded in any way...

21:06.208 --> 21:07.841
just from the country, you know?

21:07.877 --> 21:09.643
Your cousin, how lovely.

21:09.678 --> 21:12.112
Yes. My cousin. Second cousin.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.881
Lily is her name.

21:13.916 --> 21:16.984
Lily Frankenstein. Yes, that's her name.

21:17.019 --> 21:19.052
Excuse me. Oh!

21:19.104 --> 21:20.804
Not a real woman at all.

21:20.856 --> 21:23.390
The mannequin, I mean, not my cousin.

21:23.392 --> 21:24.474
She's a real woman.

21:25.394 --> 21:27.961
So your second cousin Lily
is coming to visit you.

21:27.997 --> 21:30.197
Yes. That's it entirely. Yes.

21:30.232 --> 21:32.900
And... what are we doing here?

21:35.204 --> 21:38.155
Yes, yes, of course.

21:38.207 --> 21:39.239
Being a country girl,

21:39.291 --> 21:40.908
I thought I might buy her a dress or two

21:40.960 --> 21:42.075
so she'll fit in.

21:42.077 --> 21:44.878
And you've never shopped
for women's clothing before.

21:44.914 --> 21:46.780
In a nutshell, yes.

21:46.815 --> 21:49.883
Then I shall be delighted to assist you.

21:49.919 --> 21:51.585
You always dress so...

21:51.587 --> 21:53.553
You know, with the collars and the...

21:54.473 --> 21:56.256
- black things with the...
- Mmm?

21:56.308 --> 21:57.391
Always very completely dressed.

21:58.427 --> 22:00.594
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:00.646 --> 22:02.312
Vanessa Ives, pleased to meet you.

22:02.348 --> 22:03.430
Mr. and Mrs. Ives.

22:03.482 --> 22:05.649
Oh, God, no. No, we're not married.

22:06.185 --> 22:07.734
Oh, I see.

22:07.770 --> 22:09.519
No, it's not like that either.

22:09.571 --> 22:12.940
I assure you, sir, discretion
is the watch-cry of my trade.

22:14.193 --> 22:16.660
We'll look around for a bit if we may,

22:16.695 --> 22:18.312
my non-husband and I.

22:20.532 --> 22:22.549
This is worse than I
knew it was going to be.

22:24.119 --> 22:26.286
Now, is she fair or dark?

22:26.288 --> 22:28.622
Very fair. Golden blonde hair.

22:28.674 --> 22:30.374
And her size?

22:30.426 --> 22:32.392
Precisely five feet, five inches.

22:33.495 --> 22:34.561
Very exact.

22:36.065 --> 22:38.332
I had cause to measure her height.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.300
I shan't ask.

22:42.187 --> 22:44.054
And her general body type?

22:44.106 --> 22:47.107
More rounded than yours.
Fuller hips, larger bust.

22:48.310 --> 22:49.309
Ah.

22:50.646 --> 22:51.945
How about this?

22:52.648 --> 22:55.148
It would work nicely on a
young girl with fair hair.

22:56.201 --> 22:58.118
Guipure lace is very popular

22:58.153 --> 23:01.154
and the mousseline de soie
would flatter an ample bosom.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.825
Can you... hold it up?

23:07.796 --> 23:10.497
Hmm. I've never seen you wear white.

23:10.582 --> 23:13.050
- Not my color.
- No.

23:15.888 --> 23:17.838
I'm not sure about the...

23:19.425 --> 23:21.391
- Decolletage.
- Precisely.

23:22.761 --> 23:24.394
Then we'll move on.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.599
And... would you be willing...

23:30.819 --> 23:32.853
if it's not too much trouble...

23:32.905 --> 23:35.689
to have tea with us
sometime, when she's in?

23:36.525 --> 23:37.941
I shall be honored, Doctor.

23:37.993 --> 23:39.026
She's very shy.

23:39.695 --> 23:40.944
I'll whisper.

23:41.997 --> 23:43.663
There is one more thing to consider.

23:43.699 --> 23:45.198
Yes?

23:45.250 --> 23:48.168
When we've bought the dress, we'll need...

23:49.204 --> 23:50.470
undergarments.

23:59.348 --> 24:00.480
You're going to laugh.

24:00.516 --> 24:01.882
I won't, I promise.

24:01.884 --> 24:03.884
I hate to even say it aloud.

24:05.604 --> 24:08.488
- Hecate Livingstone.
- Hecate.

24:08.524 --> 24:09.806
I know!

24:09.858 --> 24:12.776
It's the name of a Greek sea goddess,

24:12.811 --> 24:14.861
Mistress of the Waves.

24:14.897 --> 24:17.781
My parents went through a
classical learning phase.

24:17.816 --> 24:19.900
My name is the hideous result.

24:20.903 --> 24:22.736
Why don't you just go by your middle name?

24:22.788 --> 24:24.471
- I can't.
- Why?

24:25.541 --> 24:26.790
Aphrodite.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.800
I'm sorry, I've been wanting to do that.

24:36.835 --> 24:39.486
God, I'm hopeless.

24:40.305 --> 24:43.173
And I'm supposed to be going to Spain next.

24:43.225 --> 24:46.226
How am I going to survive
the brigands of the Alhambra

24:46.261 --> 24:48.728
if I can't cross a damn street in Soho?

24:51.033 --> 24:53.033
I think those brigands
better watch out for you...

24:53.068 --> 24:55.068
Hecate Aphrodite Livingstone.

24:59.358 --> 25:00.607
So, how did you end up here?

25:00.609 --> 25:04.911
Because I'm trying to be a liberated woman.

25:05.781 --> 25:07.881
Not too successfully thus far, it seems.

25:07.916 --> 25:09.616
I grew up in Maine

25:09.618 --> 25:11.284
but when I graduated from Northwestern,

25:11.336 --> 25:13.620
I decided I'd had enough
of the great cow pastures

25:13.622 --> 25:16.523
of Indiana and lobster
fields of New England

25:16.558 --> 25:19.493
and deserved some proper civilization...

25:19.561 --> 25:22.129
among properly civilized people.

25:22.131 --> 25:23.847
And you're traveling alone?

25:23.882 --> 25:25.632
Yes, Mr. Chandler,

25:25.717 --> 25:27.801
American women sometimes do travel abroad

25:27.853 --> 25:29.436
without armed guards.

25:29.471 --> 25:31.638
I have a degree in botany...

25:31.640 --> 25:35.041
a sensible pair of shoes,
and a very generous account

25:35.077 --> 25:36.910
at the American Express.

25:39.815 --> 25:41.148
You're studying Latin.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.782
I'm trying to make myself into one of those

25:42.818 --> 25:44.384
civilized people you're hoping to meet.

25:44.419 --> 25:46.286
Just don't go crazy naming your kids.

25:49.324 --> 25:50.490
Are you a scholar of some sort?

25:51.493 --> 25:52.592
Do I look like a scholar?

25:52.628 --> 25:54.878
No, you look like a...

25:56.548 --> 25:59.049
I don't know what you look like.

25:59.084 --> 26:00.917
A train robber.

26:02.421 --> 26:03.603
Have you ever been out West?

26:03.639 --> 26:05.105
You mean like California?

26:05.140 --> 26:07.174
- And the New Mexico territory.
- Not yet.

26:08.177 --> 26:10.010
Adventures to come.

26:10.062 --> 26:11.945
Then he must have come to see you.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.480
Who?

26:13.515 --> 26:15.115
My father.

26:16.018 --> 26:18.351
Your accent's good, but
no trace of a Yankee in it

26:18.437 --> 26:20.220
for a girl who says she grew up in Maine.

26:21.073 --> 26:23.690
Northwestern is in Illinois, not Indiana.

26:23.692 --> 26:25.358
Maybe the Pinkertons are hiring women now,

26:25.410 --> 26:26.860
if so, I applaud them for it,

26:26.912 --> 26:28.945
because I am all for emancipation.

26:31.700 --> 26:34.000
My father failed with them
and he failed with you.

26:34.036 --> 26:35.669
So go back and tell him to leave me be

26:35.704 --> 26:37.871
or the next time he sees me,
I'll have a gun to his head

26:37.923 --> 26:39.506
with my finger on the trigger.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.043
I hope you enjoy the Alhambra...

26:43.045 --> 26:45.762
it's supposed to be very dramatic.

26:45.797 --> 26:47.464
And honestly...

26:47.516 --> 26:49.549
those aren't very sensible shoes.

26:54.890 --> 26:56.273
But I'm frightened.

26:56.308 --> 26:58.642
What horrors might it contain?

26:58.694 --> 27:01.478
Behold the evil wonders of Lucifer.

27:01.530 --> 27:04.064
Unleashing his dark powers onto the world.

27:19.881 --> 27:22.882
I don't admit to my real
name, it's beneath contempt.

27:22.918 --> 27:25.168
Let me guess then. Bartholomew?

27:25.220 --> 27:26.303
Oh!

27:26.338 --> 27:28.088
Tarquin?

27:28.140 --> 27:29.589
- Ahab?
- Never you mind.

27:30.676 --> 27:32.759
And "Dorian" isn't the
most fetching name either.

27:32.761 --> 27:34.427
My parents were aspiring to status.

27:34.429 --> 27:36.663
- You weren't born rich?
- Not by a far cry.

27:39.017 --> 27:41.151
Well, at least tell me how old you are.

27:41.186 --> 27:42.602
Older than I look.

27:43.772 --> 27:45.939
- Then tell me your secret.
- Ah...

27:47.109 --> 27:49.159
be careful what you wish for.

27:49.194 --> 27:50.510
Should be ashamed.

27:53.115 --> 27:54.998
You're raising a few eyebrows.

27:55.033 --> 27:56.700
You don't mind?

27:56.752 --> 27:58.451
Let them stare.

27:58.503 --> 28:00.620
Provocation is food and drink to me.

28:02.174 --> 28:03.523
Here we are.

28:06.545 --> 28:07.877
Are you ready for an adventure?

28:09.431 --> 28:10.930
Something brand new?

28:10.966 --> 28:13.166
Are there any other kind of adventures?

28:22.694 --> 28:24.611
The soldiers brought it back from India,

28:24.646 --> 28:26.813
it's called gossamer tennis. All the rage.

28:26.815 --> 28:29.482
They say there'll be
parlors all over London soon.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.121
God, electrical lighting.

28:35.157 --> 28:37.290
What that does to a girl's complexion.

28:48.837 --> 28:50.887
Champagne, please. Your best.

28:50.922 --> 28:52.055
Sir.

28:53.175 --> 28:55.725
Now, as I understand it, we bounce the ball

28:55.761 --> 28:56.843
back and forth for a bit.

28:56.845 --> 28:59.179
Yes, I'd gathered that.

28:59.231 --> 29:00.747
Shall we keep score?

29:00.782 --> 29:02.349
Why else live?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.187
Oh!

29:07.939 --> 29:09.556
One for me.

29:27.876 --> 29:31.711
I made ridiculous errors...
but it wasn't that.

29:32.931 --> 29:34.514
He smelled me.

29:35.884 --> 29:37.434
You might have suspected as much.

29:42.774 --> 29:43.890
Lupus Dei.

29:43.942 --> 29:45.558
There's no doubt now.

29:45.610 --> 29:48.728
Then we shall have to meet him...

29:48.730 --> 29:50.563
tooth for claw.

29:51.783 --> 29:54.818
I'll prepare the enchantment for tonight.

29:54.870 --> 29:56.286
Take the others.

29:56.321 --> 29:58.071
- You know what to bring me?
- Yes.

30:03.478 --> 30:05.412
Don't disappoint me again, girl.

30:12.971 --> 30:14.821
Caution, daughter.

30:18.760 --> 30:19.826
You over-reach.

30:22.347 --> 30:24.063
I don't trust that little man.

30:24.099 --> 30:26.933
Mr. Lyle is distinctly untrustworthy.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.603
But as weak as a lily. Have no fear of him.

30:30.655 --> 30:31.704
And the others?

30:31.740 --> 30:33.406
Do with them as you like.

30:36.077 --> 30:37.677
Only Miss Ives matters.

30:39.448 --> 30:41.314
Bring me what I need.

31:01.136 --> 31:02.635
That's made from a champagne cork.

31:02.637 --> 31:04.020
What is?

31:04.055 --> 31:05.355
The ball.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.940
How can you tell?

31:06.975 --> 31:09.476
Darling, I can smell champagne at 30 yards

31:09.528 --> 31:12.145
locked in a steamer trunk
at the bottom of the ocean.

31:14.149 --> 31:17.050
I do believe that makes 12 games to...

31:17.085 --> 31:19.519
- How many is it?
- None.

31:19.554 --> 31:21.488
None, that's right, poor lamb.

31:22.407 --> 31:23.573
Another game?

31:23.625 --> 31:25.542
Do you think your pride can take it?

31:25.577 --> 31:27.627
Losing again to a defenseless female?

31:27.662 --> 31:29.229
And you are neither of those things,

31:29.264 --> 31:30.563
as we both well know.

31:30.599 --> 31:33.299
And where would we be
without our little deceptions?

31:34.553 --> 31:36.769
I think we should be very uninteresting.

31:36.805 --> 31:38.171
It's the subterfuge

31:38.173 --> 31:39.939
that makes it all the more delicious.

31:39.975 --> 31:42.108
Knowing the secrets others don't.

31:42.143 --> 31:43.893
Being who we want to be...

31:43.929 --> 31:45.111
not who we are.

32:17.462 --> 32:19.379
How's it feeling?

32:19.431 --> 32:20.964
It's very tight.

32:22.784 --> 32:25.018
That's meant to be the point.

32:25.053 --> 32:26.886
I can barely breathe.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.724
I think that's meant to be the point, too.

32:31.776 --> 32:33.893
Ladies aren't supposed to exert themselves.

32:34.563 --> 32:36.496
I won't be able to walk.

32:36.531 --> 32:38.031
Lots of young ladies do.

32:39.451 --> 32:40.984
You shall as well.

32:41.036 --> 32:42.869
Are you going to teach me that, too?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.372
I'll do my best.

32:46.408 --> 32:48.241
Trust me, you've quite a challenge.

32:49.277 --> 32:51.344
I feel like a mule.

32:51.379 --> 32:53.780
All right, I'm finished. Are you ready?

32:54.382 --> 32:55.582
Have on.

33:20.358 --> 33:21.991
I can't believe you've
ever been this silent

33:22.077 --> 33:23.526
in your entire life.

33:28.650 --> 33:29.916
Lily...

33:32.654 --> 33:34.120
you look beautiful.

33:36.224 --> 33:38.925
- I can't breathe.
- That's the corset.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.493
Yes, I know what it is, cousin,

33:40.528 --> 33:41.628
I'm wearing it.

33:46.384 --> 33:49.369
Can you help me? I think
I'm going to topple over.

33:57.612 --> 33:59.529
The shoes are awfully high.

33:59.564 --> 34:01.981
Yes... I picked them for that.

34:02.033 --> 34:03.316
Why?

34:05.153 --> 34:07.720
I... like that in a woman.

34:10.492 --> 34:13.409
Displays the talocrural region
and the leg's dorsiflexion.

34:14.496 --> 34:15.460
That's flattering.

34:27.308 --> 34:29.058
Do all women wear corsets?

34:30.145 --> 34:32.645
Most... of a certain class anyway.

34:33.598 --> 34:34.981
It seems...

34:35.817 --> 34:38.818
I don't have the word, um... cruel.

34:39.737 --> 34:41.187
The bone's sticking into my skin.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.755
I believe you can adjust it around a bit.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.092
Are you going to fix that yourself?

34:48.079 --> 34:49.195
Of course.

34:50.248 --> 34:51.664
I'm good with stitching.

34:53.083 --> 34:56.002
So, women wear corsets so
they don't exert themselves?

34:56.838 --> 34:58.037
Partly.

34:58.873 --> 35:00.573
What would be the danger if they did?

35:01.876 --> 35:03.376
They'd take over the world.

35:07.682 --> 35:08.965
The only way we men prevent that

35:09.017 --> 35:10.383
is by keeping women corseted...

35:10.969 --> 35:13.553
in theory... and in practice.

35:16.891 --> 35:18.357
They're meant to flatter the figure.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.127
To a man's eye, anyway.

35:25.817 --> 35:27.900
All we do is for men, isn't it?

35:29.821 --> 35:31.370
Keep their houses...

35:32.073 --> 35:35.041
raise their children,
flatter them with our pain.

35:37.629 --> 35:38.745
No.

35:40.248 --> 35:42.081
Does this corset flatter me?

35:47.255 --> 35:48.387
Yes.

35:49.390 --> 35:51.023
Do you want me to wear it?

35:57.599 --> 35:59.482
I want nothing to cause you pain.

36:01.102 --> 36:04.570
Not for flattery, or... my vanity...

36:07.976 --> 36:09.675
or anything under the sun.

36:10.695 --> 36:13.830
Now, please... go and take it off.

36:14.916 --> 36:16.833
The dress will look fine without it.

36:16.868 --> 36:18.217
Thank you.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.457
But I'll keep the shoes on if I may.

36:24.492 --> 36:26.058
I thought they hurt your feet.

36:26.094 --> 36:27.794
Yes. But you like them.

36:59.794 --> 37:02.662
Fortunately for her, you
were there, otherwise...

37:08.803 --> 37:10.336
I'm fluent in Arabic,

37:10.388 --> 37:12.672
but this script's highly obscure.

37:12.724 --> 37:15.074
I can only make out certain words.

37:18.012 --> 37:19.428
These might help.

37:30.358 --> 37:33.242
Oh, yes. That's much better.

37:33.278 --> 37:35.528
I don't know if they entirely suit you...

37:35.530 --> 37:36.796
a bit de trop.

37:38.199 --> 37:39.699
Look, it's something like...

37:40.201 --> 37:42.368
"Us by our winged backs

37:42.370 --> 37:46.339
and raised us over His head. Thence... "

37:56.718 --> 38:01.220
"Found us to be evil angels,
so He cast us out. He took... "

38:01.272 --> 38:02.555
"Us by our winged backs

38:02.557 --> 38:05.274
and raised us over His head. Thence... "

38:05.310 --> 38:06.993
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

38:07.595 --> 38:08.995
Now that you've given up the Nile,

38:09.030 --> 38:10.663
you need a new quest.

38:10.698 --> 38:11.898
Perhaps I do.

38:13.468 --> 38:14.600
And you shouldn't be vain

38:14.636 --> 38:16.168
about needing spectacles, you know.

38:16.204 --> 38:18.337
You're a strapping sort of man all told.

38:18.373 --> 38:20.156
Well, I suppose I'm...

38:21.709 --> 38:24.076
courting after a fashion.

38:25.413 --> 38:28.080
Sir Malcolm, you vanquish
me. Who's the lucky lady?

38:28.132 --> 38:29.465
You know her, in fact.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
I first met her at your house.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.253
Mrs. Poole.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.807
Oh, yes, our clairvoyant friend.

38:40.895 --> 38:45.364
You might... well,
proceed with caution, eh?

38:46.367 --> 38:48.935
I have no choice but to. I remain married.

38:48.987 --> 38:50.937
All for the best then.

38:50.989 --> 38:53.472
Those little dalliances
can get so Byzantine.

38:54.676 --> 38:57.576
My past is littered with
overly Byzantine dalliances

38:57.612 --> 38:59.745
from Stoke-on-Trent to Budapest.

39:03.284 --> 39:04.367
Hmm.

39:07.705 --> 39:10.039
I think she came from my father.

39:10.091 --> 39:11.123
Why?

39:11.125 --> 39:14.093
He wants me to come home.
He's sent others before.

39:14.762 --> 39:16.629
What was her name?

39:16.681 --> 39:18.180
Alias, more like.

39:18.216 --> 39:19.565
Hecate, she said.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.300
It's some kind of Greek sea goddess.

39:22.136 --> 39:24.904
Oh. That was a lie as well.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.173
Hecate wasn't a sea goddess.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.558
She was a moon goddess,
and bringer of magic.

39:30.528 --> 39:32.361
And also a character in Macbeth,

39:32.397 --> 39:33.813
the Protector of Witches.

39:35.033 --> 39:36.482
She didn't look like a witch.

39:37.735 --> 39:39.919
And would an old crone
have attracted your eye?

39:41.823 --> 39:43.589
No, Mr. Chandler,

39:43.624 --> 39:47.293
they can assume many guises,
like a chameleon on a leaf.

39:47.328 --> 39:50.730
In their natural state,
they're more... memorable.

39:52.834 --> 39:54.667
She was some chameleon then.

39:58.006 --> 39:59.472
Do you feel like some coffee?

40:00.341 --> 40:01.640
No, thank you.

40:02.393 --> 40:03.759
I'll be right back.

40:23.698 --> 40:26.665
Vanessa... come and look at this.

41:05.740 --> 41:07.039
Well, don't you look fetching?

41:18.453 --> 41:19.852
I'll do that.

41:19.887 --> 41:21.637
I don't mind. Pays for my keep.

41:21.672 --> 41:23.856
Pays for my keep.

41:28.179 --> 41:29.495
She should eat more.

41:30.681 --> 41:32.898
You worry about her, don't you?

41:32.934 --> 41:35.768
She's a lioness. She does not worry me.

41:37.155 --> 41:38.537
But you worry about Sir Malcolm.

41:42.527 --> 41:46.028
- Can I ask you a question?
- Can I stop you?

41:47.281 --> 41:49.348
Were you a hunter where you came from?

41:50.451 --> 41:51.517
Partly.

41:53.121 --> 41:54.253
What was the other part?

41:55.957 --> 41:57.256
Private.

42:04.849 --> 42:06.298
I should get you an apron.

42:14.575 --> 42:15.641
"In the great war

42:15.693 --> 42:17.109
for the Heavenly Throne,
we were vanquished... "

42:17.145 --> 42:19.195
"So God looked down on His
defeated angels and He... "

42:19.230 --> 42:21.647
"Found us to be evil angels",

42:21.649 --> 42:23.048
so He cast us out. He took... "

42:23.084 --> 42:24.650
"Us by our winged backs

42:24.652 --> 42:27.186
and raised us over His head. Thence... "

42:30.024 --> 42:31.991
- Thence?
- Cast us to Hell?

42:36.297 --> 42:38.797
Does any of this strike
a chord in you, Vanessa?

42:39.333 --> 42:40.466
Yes.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.803
My friend, the Cut Wife, said to me...

42:46.340 --> 42:49.642
"When Lucifer fell, he did not fall alone."

42:49.677 --> 42:52.344
And the Demon's purpose
in telling his tale?

42:52.380 --> 42:53.746
A prophecy.

42:53.781 --> 42:55.147
Give it a thought.

42:56.067 --> 42:59.285
Lucifer tells a past tense
narrative to a monk. Why?

42:59.987 --> 43:01.720
Just so his history can be recorded?

43:03.457 --> 43:05.257
No.

43:05.293 --> 43:08.627
If we accept the Devil
walks amongst us today...

43:09.197 --> 43:10.746
we must consider this is meant to be part

43:10.781 --> 43:12.114
of an ongoing story,

43:12.166 --> 43:13.999
that it has relevance now.

43:15.670 --> 43:17.620
It's possible he wasn't
just recounting the past

43:17.672 --> 43:19.505
but foretelling the future.

43:19.540 --> 43:20.806
Whose future?

43:25.546 --> 43:27.479
I think most likely yours.

43:28.549 --> 43:29.582
You don't know that.

43:29.617 --> 43:31.317
- Vanessa...
- You don't know that!

43:31.886 --> 43:33.719
Are there any references to a woman?

43:33.771 --> 43:35.321
- To anyone like me?
- We're not done yet.

43:35.356 --> 43:37.556
You'll understand I find
it difficult to accept

43:37.608 --> 43:40.609
I'm the object of an eternal Satanic quest

43:40.645 --> 43:42.111
that's so far only demonstrated

43:42.146 --> 43:45.231
in something that's
half-poetry, half-gibberish.

43:45.233 --> 43:46.899
I'm sorry. No!

43:52.573 --> 43:54.740
I'm tired. I apologize.

43:54.742 --> 43:55.908
No need.

43:55.910 --> 43:58.077
I think I should turn in. You'll excuse me?

43:58.112 --> 44:00.312
- Good night.
- Sleep well, my dear.

44:01.549 --> 44:02.748
As I can.

44:12.310 --> 44:13.809
Good night, gentlemen.

44:13.844 --> 44:16.195
Don't tell me you're
going to Miss Sembene's...

44:17.231 --> 44:19.565
- What is that?
- Buttercream torte.

44:21.319 --> 44:23.068
Two words I thought I'd never hear

44:23.104 --> 44:24.653
coming out of your mouth.

44:25.940 --> 44:27.940
Save me some for breakfast.

44:27.942 --> 44:29.275
Good night.

44:30.444 --> 44:32.578
Does she really eat dessert for breakfast?

44:34.165 --> 44:35.447
Always.

49:15.195 --> 49:17.563
No sensible shoes now, Mr. Chandler.
