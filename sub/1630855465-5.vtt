00:14.514 --> 00:15.890
[grunts]

00:18.852 --> 00:21.896
Can you believe it?
This is everything we hoped for.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.357
Kids playin’ with busted up Eggforcers?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.025
Not that. Freedom.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.738
With the Chaos Council gone,
we can finally make New Yoke City

00:29.821 --> 00:32.741
what we want, what its citizens deserve...

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
return our home to what it was.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.788
-All the trees...
-And the beaches--

00:38.872 --> 00:39.831
[rumbles]

00:41.875 --> 00:43.543
This can't be good.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.921
[grunting]

00:53.052 --> 00:56.848
This be more than I bargained for!

00:56.931 --> 00:58.308
-Dread?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.620
[Sonic] Yuck!

01:19.162 --> 01:21.790
[groans] Huh?

01:22.707 --> 01:24.834
Me beauty.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.760
[beeping]

01:47.232 --> 01:49.067
[Rebel Rouge] No.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.277
So much for everything we hoped for.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.491
[speaking in robot voice]

01:56.991 --> 01:58.201
[gasps]

01:58.701 --> 02:00.912
Sorry, Mr. Eggforcer.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.497
[speaking in robot voice]

02:03.373 --> 02:05.458
Oh, coconuts.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.934
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Ah, can’t you just taste
the soot and ozone.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.770
[grunts disgustingly]
We never should’ve left it

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
in the hands of these ignorant peasants!

02:28.314 --> 02:30.441
But we’ve already discussed this!

02:30.525 --> 02:35.029
Leaving to gather three Shards
was the prudent decision.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.449
Now we’ll be powerful enough
to make short work of them.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.662
You know I can’t plan for
a shatterversal domination

02:42.745 --> 02:46.833
with all those rebellion ingrates
making a rocket!

02:46.916 --> 02:52.172
And didn’t that dag-blasted rebellion
start in your neighborhood?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.883
Rebels joined from all five districts,

02:54.966 --> 02:57.594
besides, their hideout
was in Deep’s district.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.096
We should just burn your district to ash!

03:00.179 --> 03:03.224
Someone needs to feed the baby.
He’s cranky.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.477
Save this negative energy for later.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.397
Each of us has to clean up his own house,

03:09.480 --> 03:12.859
so we can make
a beautiful mess of reality.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.611
[yelling]

03:26.122 --> 03:27.999
Rescue op, street side, now!

03:35.423 --> 03:38.509
Dread? Dread? Dread?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.054
Where are you?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.599
It’s the rebels!

03:48.436 --> 03:49.938
It’s madness out here.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.314
It’s hopeless.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.443
-Missed me?
-Sonic?

03:55.526 --> 03:58.780
I shoulda known when everything
went bad, you’d show up.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.448
Hey, I’m here to help!

04:00.531 --> 04:03.368
Except you always seem
to make things worse.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.419
The cerulean simpleton again?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.547
[Dr. Don’t] He is the definitive bug
in our game.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.716
Peace, my brothers.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.095
The Blue Blight
currently infests my district,

04:22.178 --> 04:25.974
and I will purge him like toxins
after a juice cleanse.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.894
But first, let us secure
our own NestEgg...

04:36.693 --> 04:40.697
and give the rebels a little something
to keep them busy.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.825
What makes you so sure
you’ll exterminate the rodent?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.286
He’s bested you at every turn!

04:46.369 --> 04:47.829
Got any new ideas?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.999
Actually, no. Nothing new.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.752
[speaking in robot voice]

04:54.836 --> 04:57.422
I’m going to recycle.

-[whimpering]
-[screaming]

05:04.345 --> 05:07.640
Come on, don’t let Sonic
get in all the good licks!

[grunting]

05:09.100 --> 05:10.351
[yelling]

05:22.905 --> 05:26.075
It’s great to see you guys again,
it really is, but I--

05:26.159 --> 05:28.077
Answers! Where did you come from?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.120
Well...

05:33.124 --> 05:34.792
[screaming]

05:35.418 --> 05:37.128
-[inhales sharply]
-Fire!

05:38.671 --> 05:41.049
[screaming]

05:41.132 --> 05:43.468
Pirates? I hate pirates.

05:43.551 --> 05:47.013
You let the Council get their hands
on more Shards?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.181
[grunts]

05:48.264 --> 05:51.309
Technically, yes. But don’t worry,
I’ve got a plan.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.436
I’m on my way to fix it right now.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.979
We’ve heard that before!

05:55.063 --> 05:58.691
I’m gonna bust into the Yoke,
grab the Shards and rescue Nine.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.944
The fox with the attitude?
The one who stole the Shard?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.323
[stammers] I know he’s a little rough
around the edges...

06:05.406 --> 06:06.824
It’s not just the edges.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.076
...but he saved you!

06:08.159 --> 06:09.911
And then he disappeared again.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.746
Because he was captured!

06:11.829 --> 06:13.706
We can trust him.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.292
Him? We don’t even trust you!

06:16.375 --> 06:19.587
Fine. I don’t need you guys
slowing me down anyway.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.963
-I’ll just--
-Quiet!

06:25.843 --> 06:30.515
Those machines, they’ve never
been so fast. Or this aggressive.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.728
Which is exactly why I need to get
into the Yoke like, yesterday.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.605
The Shards are what matters.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.775
Go on, then. Don’t let us slow you down.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.034
It’s fine. They can handle it.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.037
Focus on the Shards,
focus on the Shards...

06:53.121 --> 06:55.540
Uh, why am I running into battle?

-[Froggy croaking]

07:19.439 --> 07:21.691
[speaking in robot voice]

07:28.156 --> 07:31.200
Well, it’s been a blast,
but I gotta get to the Yoke.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.119
-We’re going with you.
-What?

07:33.202 --> 07:34.996
We’re all heading to the Yoke.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.747
Why would we go to the Yoke?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.333
The streets are crawling
with Eggbots again!

07:39.417 --> 07:42.712
Now that the Council is back
and more powerful than ever,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.797
we have to take the fight to them.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.509
No one likes a good dust-up
more than me, you know that, Rebel,

07:48.593 --> 07:50.178
but these grunts are green.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.846
We need to get underground.

07:51.929 --> 07:56.017
Love that you’re talking this out,
but I should’ve been there already.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.686
-I can’t wait around--
-You’re gonna have to!

07:58.769 --> 08:00.605
This is bigger than you, Sonic.

08:00.688 --> 08:04.609
If you fail, and the Chaos Council
keeps the Shards, we’re finished.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.569
And I’m not letting that happen.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.362
I know this isn’t what we do.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.407
We stick to the shadows,
we fight from the shadows,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.118
but this time,
there’s just too much at stake.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.621
We have to bring the fight right to them.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.831
Maybe there’s a way we can do both.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.960
We should make it bigger!

08:23.044 --> 08:26.422
Big surprise that Dr. Slouch
wants it taller.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.009
Give it Buzzsaws! Carve them up!

08:30.092 --> 08:31.719
[Nine clears throat]

08:31.802 --> 08:34.055
You rang for me?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.516
How long are we putting up with him?

08:36.599 --> 08:39.602
He’s built us what we want,
get rid of him already.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.605
Now, now. We’re going to put him to work,

08:42.688 --> 08:45.024
but this one possesses a,
shall we say,

08:45.107 --> 08:48.528
less-dull mind than the usual riff-raff?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.738
He’ll appreciate this.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.949
Appreciate what?

08:53.032 --> 08:55.284
What we’ve built, of course.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.745
[suspenseful music playing]

08:59.580 --> 09:03.793
You’re harnessing the energy
of all three Shards?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.212
That much power is--

09:06.295 --> 09:08.673
Incalculable? Indeed.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.802
No, it isn’t! Just make them bigger!

09:12.885 --> 09:14.554
What are you guys doing?

09:15.012 --> 09:19.642
The rat is confused.
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.562
Dr. Don’t? If you wouldn’t mind.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.146
Whatevs.

We’re moving as fast as we can.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.060
[groans]

10:13.279 --> 10:14.614
What’s the plan, Rebel?

10:14.697 --> 10:17.617
Yeah, we are kinda
under a time crunch here, so...

10:17.700 --> 10:21.454
We need to get into the tunnels
on the other side of the station.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.749
Using them, we’ll be able
to get in close to the Yoke HQ

10:24.832 --> 10:27.209
with less attention than on the streets.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.920
So we just gotta get past
these chumps first?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.881
[scoffs] No sweat.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.502
Way to put the "team"
in "teamwork," everybody!

11:09.585 --> 11:13.631
Oh, looks like you can handle yourselves,
so maybe I’ll just take off.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.715
[door rumbling]

11:18.260 --> 11:20.137
[Knucks] Those things are huge.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.850
Okay, seriously,
what’s with all the upgrades?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.229
Enjoying the show?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.689
It won’t be enough.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.316
[Dr. Done It] Not enough?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.609
Balderdash!

11:33.692 --> 11:38.280
My Jumbo Eggforcers will pound
that varmint into blueberry jelly!

11:38.906 --> 11:39.990
We’ll see.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.118
Yes, we will.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.578
You admire him, don’t you?

11:44.662 --> 11:48.416
For all of your bluster,
you think of him as a friend.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.794
Funny, I thought you were smart.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.133
[Sonic] Whoa.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.639
Knucks, we’ll handle this one.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
Can you clear the exit?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.477
Let’s move.

[grunts]

12:19.113 --> 12:22.324

Let's go!

[Dr. Done It] Sweet corn!
They destroyed my babies!

12:49.768 --> 12:53.772
My big, beautiful babies!

12:53.856 --> 12:56.442
So much for "just make them bigger."

Next time, try laser eyes.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.784
[groans] Enough!

13:07.578 --> 13:10.664
So, which one are we doing?

13:10.748 --> 13:13.334
[Mr. Doctor Eggman] [scoffs] I don’t care!

13:13.417 --> 13:15.419
Do whatever you want.

[ominous music playing]

13:31.977 --> 13:34.855
[gasps] I’m starting to think
this was a bad idea.

13:34.939 --> 13:39.276
They’ve never had this many Eggforcers,
and they’ve never been this tough.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.278
What do we got left to lose?

13:41.362 --> 13:43.822
Look, this is all getting pretty intense

13:43.906 --> 13:46.367
and it’s a lot more
than you signed up for.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.954
I don’t blame any of you
if you don’t want to go any further.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.288
But I have to go.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.250
I have a fox friend to rescue
and a world to save,

13:54.333 --> 13:55.668
a few worlds, actually.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.212
I should have been doing this
alone anyway.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.799
No. The Chaos Council are not going
to stop at bigger robots,

14:01.882 --> 14:04.677
and you’re our best shot
at any sort of victory.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.136

mind you.

We both know that the other members
of the Council won’t stop Sonic.

you’re just a stupid fox.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.837
Alone. Useless. Pathetic.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.800
I’m pathetic? You’re the one
with unlimited power,

16:07.883 --> 16:11.136
and all you can think to do
is build a bigger robot.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.516
[cackling]

16:15.891 --> 16:19.603
Tell me how to defeat Sonic!

16:19.687 --> 16:22.106
You can’t, he’s too fast.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.565
He thinks on his feet.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.235
No matter what you throw at him,
he takes it.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.488
No matter how hard you hit him,
he always gets back up!

16:29.571 --> 16:32.992
You’ll never beat Sonic,
because you can’t understand him.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.994
You don’t think like he thinks.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.162
You’re not even in the same league.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.957
So I need to think like Sonic?

16:40.040 --> 16:43.460
I knew you had vision and imagination.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.421
Hey, wait! I didn’t--

16:45.504 --> 16:47.923
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Yes, yes you did.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.092
[Nine] Oh, what have I done?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.887
-Nine to Sonic.
-Nine?

16:54.763 --> 16:56.390
Are you there, Sonic?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.437
Warning your friend? Not cool.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.983
[Sonic] Can’t take your eyes off me, huh?

17:06.734 --> 17:08.986
Come on, do your worst!

17:11.488 --> 17:16.827
[triumphant music playing]

17:27.046 --> 17:30.507
Yeesh. You guys need some team spirit.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.094
-[gasps] Dagnabbit!
-No! No!

17:34.178 --> 17:37.306
Gentlemen! Why the long faces?

17:37.389 --> 17:41.810
Could it be that your plans
amounted to nothing, again?

17:42.436 --> 17:45.606
Well, if it isn’t the cat
that ate the canary.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.024
Where have you been?

17:47.107 --> 17:51.487
Answers aren’t hard to find,
if you know the right neck to twist.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.697
Turns out our many-tailed prisoner

17:53.781 --> 17:57.951
has been in communication
with Sonic this whole time.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.913
I knew it! That rat’s a rat!

18:00.996 --> 18:03.540
I am a fox!

18:03.624 --> 18:06.251
I’m gonna turn you into a bath robe!

18:06.335 --> 18:08.712
[babbles]

18:08.796 --> 18:11.590
Ah, let’s not be hasty.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.511
The fox can lure Sonic right to us.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.056
How is that going to help?
He keeps beating our Eggforcers!

18:19.139 --> 18:20.724
Exactly.

18:20.808 --> 18:25.562
That’s why I have
something better in mind.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.650
My interrogation of our prisoner
has inspired a design

18:29.733 --> 18:33.362
for our greatest robotic creation.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.572
Watch and learn.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.450
[ominous music playing]

18:43.122 --> 18:45.874
Nice job. Told you he’d make it.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.876
Make it? Uh... thanks.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.419
I can take it from here.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.672
No chance. We’ve come this far.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.715
We finish this together.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.677
Easy to say.
But we still gotta get inside.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.887
This place is locked down.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.974
Take cover!

19:02.516 --> 19:04.268
More Eggforcers?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.562
[groans] I hate to say it, but--

19:06.645 --> 19:10.649
We’re not retreating!
We make our stand, here and now!

19:12.901 --> 19:16.655
We can't hold them off for long.
We need to get inside, now!

19:17.364 --> 19:19.950
-[Nine] Sonic!
-Nine? About time!

19:20.033 --> 19:22.911
[Nine] Bring your friends
to the southwest doors.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.831
You okay? You sound strange.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.541
[Nine] I’ll get you in.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.919
My inside fox is gonna get us in. Come on!

19:31.003 --> 19:34.006
"Bring your friends"?
Why would he say that?

19:34.089 --> 19:37.885
Because he’s a nice guy.
I told you, we can trust him!

19:39.178 --> 19:41.221
Not like we have another option.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.016
Rebels! Fall back!

19:45.058 --> 19:48.562
[Sonic] Yes! I knew Nine
wouldn’t let me down. Come on!

19:56.528 --> 20:00.657
Yeah, this isn’t ominous at all.
I don’t like this.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.493
You don’t like anything.
Anyone got a light?

20:05.245 --> 20:06.455
Nine?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.251
Is that you?

20:19.426 --> 20:20.969
No, it's...

20:21.511 --> 20:22.763
you.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.562
