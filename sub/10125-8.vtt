00:19.734 --> 00:24.300
IT'S STUFF LIKE THIS
THAT REALLY MAKES YOU
UNPOPULAR.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.867
SURE. AND IT'S LONELY
AT THE TOP.

00:26.867 --> 00:30.233
BUT I SAVE
A LOT OF MONEY
ON CALL-WAITING.

00:30.233 --> 00:34.200
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST THROWING
AN ILLEGAL RAVE?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.934
WHAT IS A RAVE,
ANYWAY?

00:35.934 --> 00:38.600
A ROWDY,
UNDERGROUND PARTY.

01:01.934 --> 01:04.300
YOU THROW THE PARTY
OF THE YEAR

01:04.300 --> 01:05.400

KNOW ABOUT IT.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.000
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MAKES ME LOOK?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
SHORT.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
COME ON, ERIC.
I WANT IN ON THIS.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I CAN HELP YOU
SPREAD THE WORD.

THEY CAN NEVER KNOW
ABOUT THIS PARTY.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.100
AND WHO WOULD THEY
HEAR ABOUT IT FROM?

HAVING THE RAVE?

01:53.367 --> 01:57.200
NO, HE'S ON BOARD--
A CRUISE TO MEXICO.
HE WON'T KNOW.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.400
A PLACE TO RAVE!

01:58.400 --> 01:59.867
OF COURSE!
BECAUSE WE'RE...

WILL LOVE IT!

IT DOESN'T LOOK DONE.

02:32.233 --> 02:35.967
I KNOW.
I SPENT TOO MUCH
TIME ON THE CASE.

02:35.967 --> 02:39.400
I DID SAY
OUR ANNIVERSARY
IS TOMORROW.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.233
GUYS, KEEP DAD
OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.967
MR. LAWRENCE AND I
NEED TO DISCUSS
REALITY.

02:43.967 --> 02:44.967
OH, COOL.

PLAN THE RAVE

02:47.600 --> 02:49.400

NO, BOYS.

IT'S FOR ROMANCE.

IN THE RAVE.

CANCEL IT.

JUST ONCE,
I'D LIKE TO MEET
A GUY WITH GUTS

09:35.567 --> 09:36.900

09:38.967 --> 09:40.367
MAYBE HE HAD
A GOOD REASON!

09:40.367 --> 09:46.400

SOMETHING NICE FOR
HIS MOMMY AND DADDY!

11:09.200 --> 11:10.667
WELL, STOP THEM!

11:10.667 --> 11:15.000
O.K. BUT I'LL NEED
WHIPPED CREAM
AND A REALLY BIG SPOON.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.500
I'LL INTERCEPT
MY PARENTS UPSTAIRS

11:16.500 --> 11:20.500
AND TELL THEM THE PARTY'S
AT THE RESTAURANT
ACROSS THE STREET.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.667

SHE DOESN'T EVEN
GO TO OUR SCHOOL.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.300
THIS RAVE
IS SO BIG!

11:46.300 --> 11:49.133
WE CAN STILL GET
MOM AND DAD'S FRIENDS

11:49.133 --> 11:51.467

THANK YOU

DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH CHOICE, DID I?

12:01.200 --> 12:04.100
YOU WERE SITTING

12:35.800 --> 12:39.400
THAT THEME IS
A WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.667
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A SURPRISE PARTY.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.100
HA HA. SO LET'S PRETEND

12:44.100 --> 12:46.700
THAT THE NEXT TWO PEOPLE
WALKING DOWN THOSE STAIRS

12:46.700 --> 12:48.133
ARE CELEBRATING
THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

12:48.133 --> 12:51.133
WHEN YOU SEE THEM,
SHOUT, "SURPRISE!"

12:51.133 --> 12:52.233

13:10.100 --> 13:11.233
HEY, MATTHEWS,

13:11.233 --> 13:14.400
BY THE WAY,

TOMORROW MORNING--

13:14.400 --> 13:15.400

13:15.400 --> 13:19.500

TRYING TO GET IN.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.767
YOU'RE NOT
ON THIS LIST,
YOU DON'T GET IN.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.500
BUT THE SURPRISE
PARTY IS FOR US.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.934

13:52.367 --> 13:53.400
IT'S MOM AND DAD!

13:53.400 --> 13:55.600
WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING
PAST THEM.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.800
NO, WE CAN'T.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.367
IT WAS CRAZY TO THINK
WE COULD KEEP THIS A SECRET.

14:00.367 --> 14:03.100
ERIC, I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD--

14:03.100 --> 14:06.200
KEEP THEIR GUESTS WAITING?
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.600
GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND TRY TO ACT SURPRISED.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.700
MOM, DAD,

14:16.700 --> 14:18.700
HAPPY BIG 2-0!

LEGENDS.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.100

SUSPECTED A THING.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.600
ERIC, WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

14:32.600 --> 14:35.600
OH, DADDY,

NOTHING TO YOU?

TCH!

EVERYBODY'S RAVING.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.700

TELL MY PARENTS,

14:43.700 --> 14:45.100

BETWEEN ME AND YOUR DAD,

15:26.600 --> 15:29.700
WELL, THAT WAS MY FAULT.

15:29.700 --> 15:33.834
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, DO YOU?

15:33.834 --> 15:37.734
I'M REALLY FRIGHTENING
YOU NOW, AREN'T I?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.133
SINCE IT'S YOUR
ANNIVERSARY,

15:41.133 --> 15:43.700
THIS IS FOR YOU.

15:44.767 --> 15:45.967
MY WATCH.

15:45.967 --> 15:49.600

YOU'D LIKE IT.

A GOOD TIME
AT <i>OUR </i>PARTY?

GET AWAY WITH THIS.

16:03.367 --> 16:06.000

THE BEST PART?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.200
YOUR PARENTS
DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.300
EXACTLY.
YEAH.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.100
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT,

16:17.100 --> 16:20.300
WE TRIED TO TURN IT INTO
YOUR ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.867
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
INVITING PEOPLE.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.200
ALL NIGHT, HUH?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.667
ALL THAT TIME
AND EFFORT.

16:27.667 --> 16:31.767
A CARD
WOULD HAVE DONE IT,
SHOWN SOME THOUGHT.

16:31.767 --> 16:32.834
BUT THIS JUST SHOWS

16:32.834 --> 16:35.233
THAT YOUR FRIENDS
MEAN MORE TO YOU.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.367
IT WASN'T THAT.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.367
THEN WHAT?

16:37.367 --> 16:40.400
I JUST WANTED
ONE NIGHT, YOU KNOW,

ONE NIGHT WHERE
I'D BE REMEMBERED.

SOMETHING SPECIAL,

16:54.667 --> 16:56.200

IN A WHILE,

16:57.300 --> 17:00.600

DO SOMETHING.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.700
WE GOT TO
MAKE IT UP TO THEM.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.000
HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.900
IT WAS CLOUDY,
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN THE SUN SET.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.233
YOUR MOM WANTED
ME TO BRING THIS BY.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.667
THAT'S IT! COME ON.

ON THE LIST,
