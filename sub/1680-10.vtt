WEBVTT

00:03.930 --> 00:05.370
these silly things called gyms.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.210
The idea was you'd pay them lots of money

00:08.270 --> 00:09.810
to run around and lift heavy things.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.040
biggest rip-off in the world

00:11.110 --> 00:12.480
and yet people fell for it.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.450
including me.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.510
oh, forgot my wallet

00:17.580 --> 00:18.950
it started with one of those moments

00:19.020 --> 00:20.350
when you realize you're not as in shape

00:20.350 --> 00:21.350
as you want to be.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.490
ah, it's further than it looks.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.090
aw, coupon's on my dresser.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.590
that's too far. forget it.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.700
Please don't judge me.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.730
I winded up with shame eating the whole pizza.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.240
I woke up all greasy and sweaty.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.370
my sheets looked like what they wrap deli sandwiches in.

00:43.970 --> 00:45.540
maybe I should join a gym.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.980
you go to a gym?

00:47.040 --> 00:49.780
Well, I go to Total Rib Fitness, but I don't work out there.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.580
What do you do?

00:50.650 --> 00:52.250
I invest.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.920
There goes one of my ivestment now.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.320
cheryl, hard work's pay it off.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.220
Keep up the good work.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.830
So your investments are women?

01:01.960 --> 01:02.830
Yeah

01:03.290 --> 01:07.030
Women who, how shall put this delicately

01:07.100 --> 01:08.300
They fat.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.400
So, I come here,

01:10.470 --> 01:12.200
give them lots of attention now.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.040
Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?

01:15.170 --> 01:18.540
The one who invested in them when they weren't

01:18.810 --> 01:20.710
Wow, I can't decide if I'm thoroughly disgusted

01:20.840 --> 01:21.910
or really, really impressed

01:21.950 --> 01:24.820
of courese, not all investments pay dividends.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.750
see the girl over there vending machine-- toya.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.720
she is one kit kat away from junk bond status.

01:31.790 --> 01:32.620
hey,barney.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.290

01:40.870 --> 01:44.640

01:44.700 --> 01:45.570

01:47.300 --> 01:49.340
wow,that makes me want to join a gym.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.840
so i can get super strong

01:50.910 --> 01:52.540
and punch you really hard in the face.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.280
yes, we should all do it.

01:55.350 --> 01:58.180
yeah, let's all punch barney in the face.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.250
no, I'm serious.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.920
We should totally join a gym.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.250
come on,we put on

02:02.290 --> 02:03.390
under beer weight together--

02:03.420 --> 02:04.720
we might take it off together.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.290
or we could just stop drinking beer.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.090
no. i say we join a gym.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.730
-are you marshall?  -yeah.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.100
hi, i'm tresh.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.470
I'm the trainer you signed up for.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.530
oh,hi.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.900
really great

02:17.970 --> 02:19.300
to meet you, tresh.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.270
it's a pleasure.

02:21.370 --> 02:23.510
marshall, can i talk to you for a second?

02:23.610 --> 02:24.310
-sure. -great

02:24.440 --> 02:26.040
just a second

02:27.480 --> 02:28.780
ah, sweetie, i think

02:28.910 --> 02:31.520
she maybe just a little too hot to be your trainer.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.280
I get it.

02:33.350 --> 02:36.790
i mean, i see what you're worried about.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.520
but this just about me taking care of myself.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.190
you'll always be my sugar.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.130
so,Marsll, are you ready

02:44.260 --> 02:46.160
to make a commitment to your body?

02:46.230 --> 02:48.830
pssh! please, i'm all about committing to my body.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.240
i'll drive to Vermont and have a commitment ceremony

02:51.300 --> 02:52.740
to my body if you want.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.470
that was a weird thing to say.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.340
all right. start with 100 push-ups.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.610
-all right,cool. how many do you want me do? -100.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.950
oh,i thought that was a figure of speech--100 push-ups,

03:03.010 --> 03:04.480
like do a bazillion push-ups.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.220
no one can do 100.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.650
do you smell that?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.090
no.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.760
it smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.230
are you being a little bitch in my gym?

03:14.290 --> 03:15.690
no.

03:15.730 --> 03:17.230
then get on the floor and give me 100!

03:17.290 --> 03:20.230
you don't have to yell at me.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.970
i love it here.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.770
It's just normal women who want to get in shape.

03:23.830 --> 03:27.400
i don't have to put on makeup,do my hair,

03:27.440 --> 03:29.240
wear some trendy outfit.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.280
yeah,this place is great

03:31.280 --> 03:32.740
we're meeting our friend Robin here.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.010
i hope you don't hate her. she's pretty hot.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.350

03:35.480 --> 03:37.080

03:37.150 --> 03:40.020

03:41.180 --> 03:43.920

04:06.310 --> 04:07.780

04:28.570 --> 04:29.840
baby,are you still sore?

04:30.310 --> 04:32.810
tresh made me do 70 push-ups,

04:32.880 --> 04:34.680
but she only gave me credit for ten.

04:34.780 --> 04:36.820
then she had me do 100 sit-ups

04:36.880 --> 04:40.420
and then she made me cry, using only her words.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.390
it just doesn't add up.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.990
how could Rhonda not remember me?

04:47.060 --> 04:48.730
well,maybe it wasn't that good for her.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.100
i mean,it was your first time.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.030
Ted, it's me.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.070
i rocked her world.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.500
you don't believe me? okay,story time.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.240
the year was 1998.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.740
i'd been going out with shannon since freshman year of college.

05:01.810 --> 05:03.780
we were saving ourselves.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.180
so when  broke up

05:05.240 --> 05:07.850
there i was, 23 and still a virgin.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.150
i knew nothing about girls.

05:09.220 --> 05:10.980
so i wento the guy

05:11.020 --> 05:14.150
who knew everything about girls-- my brother james.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.090
wait,your gay brother james?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.020
yeah,this was before he was gay.

05:26.770 --> 05:28.430
barney...

05:28.570 --> 05:30.600
barney,you need to find a girl

05:30.740 --> 05:33.270
and have sex with her asap.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.010
that is what dudes do after a breakup.

05:35.070 --> 05:39.980
i know i want to,but... i guess i'm just scared.

05:40.050 --> 05:41.210
of course you're scared.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.880
it's gross.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.150
the thought of doing that with a woman.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.090
but it part of being a guy.

05:47.150 --> 05:48.220
try thinking  about baseball.

05:48.350 --> 05:51.690
somehow i imagine those players on the field

05:51.760 --> 05:54.030
and it's over a lot faster.

05:54.090 --> 05:57.930
but i don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.230
what do you...? how do you...?

06:00.270 --> 06:01.270
where do you...?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.600
stop. don't overthink it.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.200
you don't want to get the yips.

06:05.270 --> 06:06.240
the yips?

06:06.370 --> 06:08.340
yeah,when you overthink simple things so much

06:08.410 --> 06:10.540
that you can't do them at all.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.980
the yips

06:13.050 --> 06:14.850
yeah,it happens to athletes all the time.

06:14.910 --> 06:16.850
like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to the first

06:16.920 --> 06:19.550
or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop

06:19.690 --> 06:22.020
and then loses it on the arabesq.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.290
i've actually really been getting into

06:24.320 --> 06:25.760
figure skating lately.

06:25.860 --> 06:28.960
but james...

06:29.030 --> 06:31.330
what woman's gonna have sex with me?

06:31.430 --> 06:33.070
it not like i'm a backsreet boy

06:33.130 --> 06:37.040
the man maker.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.910
rhonda man maker french

06:54.190 --> 06:57.960
i let him snake my drain,  if you know what i mean.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.990
you know that chinese food delivery boy?

07:01.060 --> 07:02.730
i had sex with him.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.930
i don't have a funny way of saying it yet.

07:05.030 --> 07:09.100
it just happened 20 minutes ago.

07:09.170 --> 07:10.740

07:10.800 --> 07:11.970
the man maker

07:12.040 --> 07:14.070

oh,boy.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.120

08:50.640 --> 08:51.840
freddy shiba tony

that kid had a tongue like a gecko.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.140
you just rocked my world.

10:05.210 --> 10:09.120
that was the best sex i ever had.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.090
but you said i rocked your world.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.050
all subseqnt

10:14.120 --> 10:16.120
worlds that i rocked

10:16.160 --> 10:18.460
were only so rocked because of the confidence I earned

10:18.490 --> 10:20.190
from you said first world rocking.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.160
sorry barry.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.470
it's barney.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.410
so i'm doing sit-ups

10:31.480 --> 10:32.650
and she says,"all right,marshall,

10:32.710 --> 10:34.180
just one more set."

10:34.250 --> 10:36.480
so i summon all my strenght and do that set,

10:36.550 --> 10:37.520
and then she says,

10:37.580 --> 10:39.020
"give me another set."

10:39.090 --> 10:40.250
so i'm like,"is this the last set?"

10:40.350 --> 10:42.320
and she says yes.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.860
so i do that set and then she says,

10:43.890 --> 10:44.760
"give me another set."

10:44.890 --> 10:46.560
she lied to my fece!

10:46.630 --> 10:47.860
everything hurts.

10:49.430 --> 10:50.930
baby,the whole point of working out

10:51.000 --> 10:52.230
is to feel better.

10:52.330 --> 10:54.130
this trainer is making you miserable.

10:54.230 --> 10:55.840
you have to call her and quit

10:55.900 --> 10:58.470
i got to work through it.i got  finish what i started.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.970
if you're too scar,i can call her.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.440
her number's on this card.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.340
hi. is this trish?

11:06.010 --> 11:07.610

11:07.780 --> 11:10.920

11:10.980 --> 11:11.880
i don't know

11:11.950 --> 11:13.720
who the hell you think you are,

11:13.790 --> 11:16.920
but from now on you don't tell marshall what to do.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.760
you are an employee.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.030
we tell you what to do.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.430
and i'm tellin you.you're fired,bitch.

11:32.710 --> 11:35.010
still bummed about the whole rhonda thing?

11:35.070 --> 11:39.280
no. why would i let the proval of one woman define who i am?

11:39.850 --> 11:41.110
that's very mature of you,barney.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.010
let him finish.

11:42.010 --> 11:45.120
when i can let the approval of a aggle of supermodels

11:45.180 --> 11:47.290
define who i am. what? what?

11:47.350 --> 11:49.660

14:23.040 --> 14:23.910
he has the yips?

14:23.940 --> 14:26.550
ooh,that's bad.

14:26.650 --> 14:30.550
you know in germany,we call this (speaks germany phra).

14:30.620 --> 14:33.190
wh,that is bad.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.490
i don't know what's happened to me.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.520
i've,i' totally lost my confidenece.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.390
barney,maybe you have to open up to somebody.

14:41.490 --> 14:43.200
maybe you have to open up to some...

14:44.060 --> 14:46.600
he just found out at the woman lost his virginity to

14:46.670 --> 14:48.770
only did it because his brother bribed her.

14:49.170 --> 14:50.770
oh,that a rough one.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.840
i mean the only thing i can think of

14:53.940 --> 14:57.580
to get rid of(speaks gean phras

14:57.610 --> 15:00.410
is you have to go out there.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.080
and you need to find that woman

15:03.080 --> 15:05.650
and you need to earn it with her for real.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.950
That is the only way how you can find yourself.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.830
I see little hamburgers!

15:12.890 --> 15:15.900
i love little hamburgers.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.260
Aufwiedersehen.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.900
I just made out with Heidilum.

15:20.970 --> 15:22.170
What?

15:22.270 --> 15:26.510
Ted,just... okay?

15:29.540 --> 15:31.680
Come in.

15:31.740 --> 15:33.510
Hi,Rhonda.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.450
Hi,kiddo. Surprised to see you here.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.590
So,hey,uh,maybe,how about sex?

15:41.620 --> 15:43.620
Let's sex.

15:43.690 --> 15:46.430
What are you talking about? I'm watching Wheel of Fortune.

15:46.490 --> 15:49.430
You can keep watching. I'll face you toward the TV.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.360
That's a cute idea,kid.

15:51.430 --> 15:52.330
Great.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.370
No,I'm not having sex with you.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.440
Sit down a minute.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.140
I'm not the Man Maker anymore

15:58.200 --> 15:59.570
You know what?

15:59.640 --> 16:01.710
About five years ago,

16:01.740 --> 16:04.440
I realized there was an emptiness inside of me

16:04.540 --> 16:07.080
that no amount of meaningless sex could fill.

16:07.150 --> 16:08.750
I needed something more.

16:08.820 --> 16:12.520
And that's when I discovered Indian casinos.

16:14.690 --> 16:17.820
Hey,Barney,

16:17.890 --> 16:20.430
it's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?

16:20.490 --> 16:24.160
Uh,not much. My entire sexual history

16:24.230 --> 16:27.770
was built on a rotting foundation of lies.

16:27.830 --> 16:31.600
My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.670
Work is good

16:38.540 --> 16:40.550
I'm never going back to that gym again.

16:42.220 --> 16:43.880
today at work, I had to have an intern

16:43.950 --> 16:46.920
rip up my bagel and put little pieces in my mouth.

16:48.490 --> 16:49.560
Yeah,I'm done there,to

16:49.620 --> 16:50.890
That place is horrible.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.090
what about your big muscular trainer

16:53.160 --> 16:55.400
who's so into stretching you out?

16:55.460 --> 16:57.260
Yeah,well,turns out

16:57.400 --> 17:02.140
that guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.900
Come on,guys,don't give up on the gym.

17:03.970 --> 17:05.970
It's been great for us.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.480
Like today Robin and I had a really nice moment.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.829
Robin,hey, I just wanted

17:25.890 --> 17:28.490
to come over and thank you.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.330
Thank me for what?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.130
Well,you know how it's hard for exes to friends

17:33.200 --> 17:35.540
because there's this lingering sexual tension between them?

17:36.570 --> 17:38.500
Gone. Thank you.

17:41.670 --> 17:43.080
You know,for all the crap you' given me

17:43.140 --> 17:45.950
I haven't seen you work up a sweat there once.

17:46.010 --> 17:47.280
It's not true.I was there today.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.410
Yeah,but didn't you leave early

17:54.350 --> 17:57.460
Oh,great

17:57.590 --> 18:00.830
now I gotta go home and charge this

18:02.200 --> 18:03.500
Wait a minute.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.930
You didn't work out Tuesday either.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.470
Brought the wrong shorts.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.070
Yeah,and you totally disaeared on Monday,too.

18:13.140 --> 18:16.110
No,I was at the gym the whole time.

18:16.180 --> 18:20.250
Ooh! Oh,I love this gym.

18:20.310 --> 18:24.650
Lily,help me bend down these three fingers.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.890
Actually,I have an idea.

18:27.020 --> 18:30.520
Do it! Come on! Do it,you worthless piece of crap!

18:30.590 --> 18:32.790
Please! Please,I just want to go home.

18:32.830 --> 18:34.490
Come on.This is your last set!

18:34.560 --> 18:38.500
You said that last time!

18:39.930 --> 18:43.040
Gone.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.910
Rhonda.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.580
I saw your friend Ted at the gym.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.520
After he puked and cleared the line at the smothie bar,

18:58.580 --> 19:01.420
he said you were kinda having a tough time.

19:02.790 --> 19:06.490
Did you change your mind about having love,making sex,

19:06.560 --> 19:08.690
penis vagina?

19:08.760 --> 19:09.630
What is the matter with me?

19:09.730 --> 19:10.460
Oh,honey...

19:10.560 --> 19:11.460
I just,I don't get it.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.030
You slept with so many guys.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.370
You slept with my brother.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.170
We are practically the same person.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.070
Was I really so bad?

19:19.140 --> 19:22.140
Nobody's good the first time.

19:22.210 --> 19:26.410
But I was. At least I thought I was.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.450
Oh,Barney,you know what,sex isn't everything.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.290
When is the last time you had a convsation

19:34.320 --> 19:36.460
with woman with no intenon of score in with her?

19:39.730 --> 19:41.360
I sat next to former Secretary of The State

19:41.460 --> 19:43.960
Madelee Albright at a benefit once.

19:44.030 --> 19:47.900
I certainly did't intend to hit that.

19:47.970 --> 19:50.470
Yeah,well,I'll tell you what.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.970
Sleeping with me again isn't gonna solve anything.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.510
I don't know what else is.

19:58.850 --> 20:00.410
I think I know.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.780
Do you have any kings?

20:02.850 --> 20:04.420
No,go fish.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.950
See,Barney,isn't it nice to just sit

20:08.020 --> 20:11.060
and have a evening with a woman,no agenda?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.490
Just make nice conversation?

20:16.230 --> 20:17.430
No.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.270
Yeah,kinda sucks, doesn't it?

20:19.330 --> 20:25.610
Oh,my God,Barney, you really did just rock my world.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.640
That was amazing.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.480
And I'not lying.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.610
I know you're not lying,baby.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.880
And it was good for you?

20:32.950 --> 20:37.080
It was the best sex I've ever had.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.290
Later.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.560
Daddy's back.

20:49.090 --> 20:50.900
Hey,buddy, how's it going?

20:50.960 --> 20:51.760
Hey. Pretty good.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.570
Pretty good. Ooh!

20:53.700 --> 20:57.600
I can move my legs now and can lift my arms this high.

20:58.740 --> 21:01.470
Yeah,you know,I feel like I have more energy.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.340
Ye,it was hard at first but now if I go a day

21:04.440 --> 21:06.510
without working out,I miss it.

21:06.950 --> 21:08.450
I'm proud of us,guys.

21:08.510 --> 21:09.680
The first week is the hardest.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.150
We're over the hump.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.420
Joining that gym was the best decision we ever made.

21:13.490 --> 21:15.020
And we never went back to the gym again.
