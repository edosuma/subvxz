21:21.676 --> 21:23.575
from 100 yards away?

21:23.577 --> 21:25.076
Oh, yeah.

21:25.078 --> 21:27.144
So here's the smart play.

21:28.847 --> 21:30.246
I'm gonna take
your guns...

21:30.248 --> 21:32.214
Relax, it's gonna be fine.

21:32.216 --> 21:33.248
Come on.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.582
We're gonna get up,

21:34.584 --> 21:36.850
we're gonna take
a little walk

21:36.852 --> 21:39.552
and then we're gonna have a
nice conversation somewhere,

21:39.554 --> 21:41.020
like gentlemen.

21:41.022 --> 21:42.287
Hmm?

21:44.958 --> 21:47.692
You know, I completely
misjudged you.

21:47.694 --> 21:50.828
You're nowhere near
as dumb as you look.

21:55.034 --> 21:56.633
LYNN:
You okay?

21:56.635 --> 21:58.201
STEVE:
I'm fine. Keep going.

21:59.204 --> 22:01.237
LYNN: See, it's not
that bad, right?

22:01.239 --> 22:03.272
Well, it's not
great, but...

22:03.274 --> 22:04.806
LYNN: I know.

22:04.808 --> 22:08.309
I'm sorry, but it's gonna
save us a lot of time.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.274
♪ ♪

22:44.946 --> 22:46.145
Steve!

22:46.147 --> 22:47.646
I'm okay.

22:47.648 --> 22:49.681
I'm good.

22:49.683 --> 22:51.582
Good work.

22:51.584 --> 22:52.683
Piece of cake.

22:52.685 --> 22:54.768
What's next?

22:54.769 --> 22:56.852
Through there, it's just
another half mile to the plane.

22:56.855 --> 22:58.788
(gunfire)

22:58.790 --> 23:01.257
Get down!

23:13.904 --> 23:15.069
Lynn, get his gun!

23:15.071 --> 23:17.071
(grunting)

23:21.377 --> 23:23.944
What are you doing here?

23:23.946 --> 23:25.612
You stand down
and I'll tell you.

23:28.683 --> 23:29.882
(shouts)

23:34.121 --> 23:35.253
(Lynn groaning)

23:35.255 --> 23:36.721
Lynn!

23:38.091 --> 23:40.157
Hey.

23:42.961 --> 23:44.226
You're bleeding.

23:44.228 --> 23:45.126
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

23:45.128 --> 23:46.360
Who is that guy?

23:46.362 --> 23:48.862
I don't know.

23:48.864 --> 23:52.131
I think he did
jail time, though.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.298
You see that tattoo
on his neck?

23:53.300 --> 23:54.766
That cross?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.233
It looks like something
from the inside.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.803
All right.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.738
Let me see it.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.772
Just...
(groans)

24:03.774 --> 24:05.140
I'm sorry.

24:05.142 --> 24:07.308
I'm sorry, but we got to
keep pressure on it, okay?

24:07.310 --> 24:08.776
Okay, I got it.

24:10.146 --> 24:11.912
He's got to be dead, right?

24:11.914 --> 24:13.113
STEVE:
Let's not celebrate just yet.

24:13.115 --> 24:14.881
He's only half our problem.

24:14.883 --> 24:16.682
His partner's still out there.

24:35.936 --> 24:37.669
STEVE:
Keep a lookout.

24:39.205 --> 24:40.437
Cuffs?

24:40.439 --> 24:42.872
STEVE: Yeah, cuffs.

24:42.874 --> 24:45.107
And leg shackles
and a belly chain.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.709
This plane was
a prisoner transport.

24:47.711 --> 24:50.044
So, the people who are after us
are escaped criminals.

24:50.046 --> 24:51.912
Well, there's
only one set.

24:51.914 --> 24:53.346
So I'm thinking the guy
we sent over the falls,

24:53.348 --> 24:55.147
he was the cargo.

24:55.149 --> 24:57.816
Only he didn't escape.

24:59.786 --> 25:01.786
These things weren't
opened forcefully.

25:01.788 --> 25:04.155
He either had the key
or the people who were

25:04.157 --> 25:06.690
guarding him let him go.

25:06.692 --> 25:09.458
Excuse me.

25:12.296 --> 25:14.229
All right.

25:15.198 --> 25:17.164
Gonna fly us
out of here, are you?

25:18.834 --> 25:20.900
Not today.

25:20.902 --> 25:25.104
Good, because that would be way
too impressive for a first date.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.773
Okay, this thing
departed from Manila

25:27.775 --> 25:29.074
9th of January, 2011.

25:29.076 --> 25:31.342
They had 20,000
pounds of fuel.

25:31.344 --> 25:33.210
ETA was 19:00 hours.

25:33.212 --> 25:36.179
LGB-- that's
Long Beach, California.

25:36.181 --> 25:38.164
Oh, that makes sense.

25:38.165 --> 25:40.148
There's a state penitentiary
there-- Terminal Island.

25:40.151 --> 25:43.352
Manila 2011...

25:43.354 --> 25:45.220
Four years ago,

25:45.222 --> 25:48.022
uh, a fugitive Boston
Mob boss by the name

25:48.024 --> 25:50.190
of-of Dennis Logan, he was
picked up in the Philippines.

25:50.192 --> 25:51.825
I remember that guy.

25:51.826 --> 25:53.459
He was always on TV
wearing the fancy suits.

25:53.461 --> 25:54.893
That's right, same guy.

25:54.895 --> 25:56.194
FBI picked him up
in the Philippines.

25:56.196 --> 25:57.428
Then they were
transporting him to prison,

25:57.430 --> 25:59.963
and presumably the
plane went down

25:59.965 --> 26:01.731
north of the
Hawaiian islands.

26:01.733 --> 26:03.833
All right,
this transponder right here?

26:03.835 --> 26:05.968
It's been turned off manually.

26:05.969 --> 26:08.102
Which means the ATC could never
have tracked this plane.

26:08.105 --> 26:10.905
To the outside world, it looked
like this plane crashed.

26:10.907 --> 26:12.806
Yeah, but wouldn't the FBI
still come looking for them?

26:12.808 --> 26:14.474
Well, yeah, sure,
but they hid the plane.

26:14.475 --> 26:16.141
I mean, we barely saw it and we
were standing right next to it.

26:16.144 --> 26:17.376
What about the pilot,

26:17.378 --> 26:19.077
all the other people
in the plane?

26:19.079 --> 26:20.912
I don't see any signs
of a struggle.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.246
So I'm thinking
they must've been in on it.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.215
Logan had money,
he had lots and lots of money.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.350
He must've paid them
to disappear.

26:27.352 --> 26:30.086
Go and see if you can find
anything useful on board.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.954
I'm gonna look in
the storage bay.

26:53.043 --> 26:54.809
Steve?

26:54.811 --> 26:58.779
This looks like something.

26:58.781 --> 27:01.114
Excellent.
That's an ELT.

27:01.116 --> 27:03.282
What?

27:03.284 --> 27:04.983
Uh, it's an Emergency
Locator Transmitter.

27:04.985 --> 27:06.451
(stammers)
It sends out a signal,

27:06.453 --> 27:07.852
a satellite grabs it,

27:07.854 --> 27:10.221
forwards the data
to-to rescue authorities.

27:10.223 --> 27:11.555
I like the sound of that.

27:11.557 --> 27:13.089
Yeah, if this thing works,

27:13.091 --> 27:14.356
phones are gonna
start ringing

27:14.358 --> 27:16.291
in relay stations
all across the country.

27:16.293 --> 27:20.228
(beep)
That's a good sign.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.997
That's not good.

27:27.936 --> 27:29.068
LYNN:
That sucks.

27:29.070 --> 27:30.970
STEVE:
Okay.

27:30.971 --> 27:32.871
Logan and his partner--
they had radios, right?

27:32.873 --> 27:35.006
Which means they got
access to a power source.

27:35.008 --> 27:36.907
If we can get
to that power source,

27:36.909 --> 27:40.343
we can get
this ELT working.

27:40.345 --> 27:42.945
Jesse's dad-- where is he?

27:42.947 --> 27:44.980
Never seen him before.

27:44.982 --> 27:46.514
Look, nobody's dead yet.

27:46.516 --> 27:48.182
Nobody's even hurt.

27:48.184 --> 27:50.217
You can still walk away
from this a free man.

27:50.219 --> 27:52.452
We just need to know
where Jesse's father is.

27:52.454 --> 27:55.221
I think I'll stop talking now.

27:55.223 --> 27:57.256
Fine.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.491
Our turn.

27:59.493 --> 28:01.593
Your name is Sean Roberts.

28:01.595 --> 28:03.227
Street knows you
as Giraffe.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.295
You did a four-year stint
in Folsom for armed robbery,

28:05.297 --> 28:07.163
18 months in Chino
for assault.

28:07.165 --> 28:09.465
Extortion and kidnapping
are a big step up for you.

28:09.467 --> 28:11.333
Let's not forget about
carrying a piece in public.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.001
So, with the right judge,

28:13.003 --> 28:16.003
you're looking at
about... ten years plus.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.272
It's got you thinking, right?

28:21.242 --> 28:23.308
(lock buzzes, clacks)

28:24.878 --> 28:28.112
Look, with a little help here,

28:28.114 --> 28:30.147
you could walk
instead of doing time.

28:30.149 --> 28:33.250
KONO: Where is
Kai Frontera?

28:33.252 --> 28:36.252
Kai who?

28:38.189 --> 28:40.255
(laughing)

28:51.968 --> 28:53.133
Look, Chin, these
guys are pros.

28:53.135 --> 28:54.501
They got encrypted phones.

28:54.503 --> 28:56.469
The crime lab's trying
to break them now.

28:56.471 --> 28:58.287
All right, well,
the clock is ticking.

28:58.288 --> 29:00.104
There's probably not enough time
to pull all the data as it is.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.173
Let's get the other one in here.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.513
Lynn, stop, wait.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.881
You're bleeding again.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.048
We got to keep moving.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.299
No, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see that.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.549
It's fine, you got
more of that shirt?

29:14.552 --> 29:16.084
Just make me a new bandage.
Just let me see it.

29:16.086 --> 29:19.387
Okay, this thing needs
more than another bandage.

29:19.389 --> 29:22.590
Okay, I'm gonna
clean the wound with this.

29:22.592 --> 29:23.958
With coconut water?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.092
Yeah, coconut water.

29:25.094 --> 29:26.126
Don't knock it.

29:26.128 --> 29:27.494
You know, in World War II,

29:27.496 --> 29:29.429
they used coconut water
in the I.V. solutions

29:29.431 --> 29:30.963
when they ran out
of glucose.

29:30.965 --> 29:32.130
Did you know that?

29:34.501 --> 29:36.400
All right.

29:40.072 --> 29:41.071
All right.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.173
Thank you.

29:43.175 --> 29:46.075
You are very welcome.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.010
(chuckles)

29:48.012 --> 29:50.045
(engine buzzing in distance)

29:50.047 --> 29:53.048
Steve, did you hear that?

29:53.050 --> 29:55.116
We got to move.

30:06.128 --> 30:09.996
Look who's back
from the dead.

30:11.032 --> 30:12.631
Where are they?

30:12.633 --> 30:14.099
I don't know.

30:14.101 --> 30:17.134
We better find them! Now!

30:19.171 --> 30:21.137
We need to get that boat.

30:21.139 --> 30:24.206
Okay, I like
where this is going.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.941
How do you suggest
we do that?

30:25.943 --> 30:27.676
You're gonna steal it.

30:30.113 --> 30:32.947
I already told you guys
I don't know no Kai.

30:32.949 --> 30:34.715
GROVER:
And we'd believe you.

30:34.717 --> 30:37.951
Well, that is if you weren't
such a world-class scumbag.

30:37.953 --> 30:39.218
Excuse me?

30:39.220 --> 30:40.953
What are you deaf, scumbag?

30:40.955 --> 30:43.188
You even know
who you're talking to?

30:43.190 --> 30:45.207
I know exactly
what I'm talking to, Diaz.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.225
A violent predicate felon
working on his second strike.

30:47.227 --> 30:48.359
And you know what?

30:48.361 --> 30:50.361
For a scumbag like yourself,

30:50.363 --> 30:52.463
a kidnap charge
is gonna mean 25 to life.

30:52.465 --> 30:55.032
If that kidnapping
gets bumped up to murder--

30:55.034 --> 30:57.535
Well, then you're just done.

30:57.536 --> 31:00.037
Then a great day for you is
gonna mean extra Jell-O.

31:00.039 --> 31:03.140
It's got to be halftime.

31:03.142 --> 31:06.610
Last chance, Armando.

31:06.612 --> 31:07.744
Or what?

31:07.746 --> 31:09.112
What are you gonna do to me?

31:09.114 --> 31:12.215
(laughing)

31:12.217 --> 31:14.584
Let me give you
some friendly advice.

31:14.586 --> 31:17.286
Make sure Kukui loses that game.

31:18.055 --> 31:19.287
(groans)

31:19.289 --> 31:21.255
You're a cop, man!

31:21.257 --> 31:23.190
You can't do this!

31:23.192 --> 31:24.591
Oh, you're absolutely right--
I can't.

31:24.593 --> 31:26.359
And you can't kidnap a guy
and force his son

31:26.361 --> 31:27.626
to throw a football game.

31:27.628 --> 31:29.561
So maybe neither you or I

31:29.563 --> 31:32.096
are the best judges
of what's right

31:32.098 --> 31:34.698
and what's wrong!
(groaning)

31:34.700 --> 31:36.232
Oh, you son of a bitch.

31:36.234 --> 31:38.133
You broke my jaw.

31:38.135 --> 31:39.667
I hope to hell I did,
because you know what?

31:39.669 --> 31:42.603
Otherwise it would mean that
your blood is all over me

31:42.605 --> 31:43.637
for nothing!

31:43.639 --> 31:45.171
GROVER: Hey, hey!
Take it easy!

31:45.173 --> 31:46.472
Hey, come on!

31:46.474 --> 31:48.073
We don't do that.

31:48.075 --> 31:50.008
You're lucky he's here.

31:50.010 --> 31:51.142
Come on.

31:51.144 --> 31:52.309
Oh, relax.
I'm not gonna hit you.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.410
I'm not gonna hit you.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.444
I'm just an old man.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.045
Now maybe I should give you

31:56.047 --> 31:58.213
a little friendly advice, hmm?

31:58.215 --> 32:01.015
You need to tell us
who you're working for.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.353
No?

32:06.355 --> 32:09.656
Okay.

32:09.658 --> 32:11.691
I'm not a gambling man
like yourself.

32:11.693 --> 32:14.493
Um, I usually only bet
on sure things.

32:14.495 --> 32:17.462
Like he's gonna keep
right on hitting you.

32:19.065 --> 32:21.131
I'll tell you what though--
just, just, just for fun.

32:21.133 --> 32:23.433
Let's see how much I got--
one, I got two,

32:23.435 --> 32:25.635
I got, I got 300.

32:25.637 --> 32:28.170
I can't bet anymore.
I got a wife.

32:28.172 --> 32:30.639
I got $300 that says

32:30.641 --> 32:33.441
you're gonna tell us
where Jesse's father is

32:33.443 --> 32:35.643
and then the kid's gonna go out,

32:35.645 --> 32:37.144
and he's gonna win
his football game.

32:37.146 --> 32:40.046
And then your boss
is going to either jail,

32:40.048 --> 32:43.115
the hospital
or the morgue today.

32:43.117 --> 32:45.383
You know what?
I dare you to take that bet.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.252
Three hundred.

32:56.193 --> 32:57.492
I didn't think so.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.021
GROVER:
<i> All right,</i>

33:06.022 --> 33:07.144
it looks like the coach just
put Jesse back in the game.

33:07.145 --> 33:08.267
He just connected
on a 40-yard pass.

33:08.269 --> 33:10.235
So Kukui's down ten

33:10.237 --> 33:12.203
with a little bit more than
14 minutes left to play.

33:12.205 --> 33:13.704
Ah, damn. Gutsy kid.

33:13.706 --> 33:15.072
Let's hope he's got
the focus to finish the game.

33:15.074 --> 33:16.339
(tablet chimes)

33:16.341 --> 33:18.341
Finally, okay,
DEA just downloaded

33:18.343 --> 33:20.176
the information
on our kidnapper.

33:20.178 --> 33:22.077
His name is Oliver Zelenko.

33:22.079 --> 33:25.080
He had an import/export business
out of Los Angeles

33:25.082 --> 33:27.048
that was just
recently shut down.

33:27.050 --> 33:29.050
The Feds think that it was a...

33:29.052 --> 33:31.218
it was a front for running
heroin from Turkey.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.186
Looks like he's also
a degenerate gambler.

33:33.188 --> 33:35.188
He had a big house in Ka'a'awa,

33:35.190 --> 33:36.923
and now it's under foreclosure.

33:36.925 --> 33:39.258
I'm guessing he put down
a big bet against Kukui

33:39.260 --> 33:40.225
to get himself healthy again.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.160
Yeah. Hey, how much further?

33:42.162 --> 33:44.695
30 miles.

33:44.697 --> 33:46.029
Shoot-- 30 miles.

33:46.031 --> 33:48.297
We got some timeouts
and delays, brutha...

33:48.299 --> 33:49.765
I don't think we gonna make it.

33:49.767 --> 33:50.899
We'll make it.

33:52.903 --> 33:55.270

33:55.272 --> 33:56.170
We're here.

33:56.172 --> 33:57.304
Good.
What about you?

33:57.306 --> 33:59.606
We broke one of the guys--
literally.

33:59.608 --> 34:02.008
He said that they're
holding Jesse's father

34:02.010 --> 34:03.142
in Ka'a'awa.

34:03.144 --> 34:04.977
We're halfway there.

34:04.979 --> 34:05.944
Kid looks kind of shaky.

34:05.946 --> 34:07.679
What do I tell him?
Nothing.

34:07.681 --> 34:09.213
Keep your men positioned
all around the field.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.281
If anyone
so much as looks at Jesse

34:11.283 --> 34:13.349
the wrong way, take him down.
Copy that.

34:17.854 --> 34:19.320
So what's the plan?

34:19.322 --> 34:20.721
Nothing changes.

34:20.723 --> 34:22.756

34:24.259 --> 34:25.625
