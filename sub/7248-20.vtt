WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.193
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

00:04.526 --> 00:07.445
I really miss you.

00:08.572 --> 00:10.031
Do you want to come in?

00:10.073 --> 00:11.616
- Rory.
- Yeah?

00:11.699 --> 00:14.201
- I love you.
- I...

00:15.286 --> 00:18.372
So I guess my coming here
was probably a bad idea.

00:18.455 --> 00:19.664
Probably.

00:19.748 --> 00:20.957
Please, don't be mad.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.877
Why? Because I say I love you
and you wanna think about it?

00:25.253 --> 00:26.587
Screw this!

00:30.424 --> 00:34.552
So then he starts ripping my $20 bill
into a million pieces.

00:34.594 --> 00:37.054
And I'm thinking,
'There's a store full of people.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.598
'Why am I the one
on line with the crazy magician?'

00:39.682 --> 00:40.974
I'll cut to the end.

00:41.058 --> 00:44.060
He couldn't put it back together
and had to pay me back in quarters.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.187
- Very good story.
- You look tired.

00:46.271 --> 00:49.023
- I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
- How come?

00:49.107 --> 00:51.901
- I just have a lot on my mind.
- Anything I can do?

00:51.984 --> 00:54.736
- Flag down the coffee.
- Arm going up now.

00:56.321 --> 00:58.030
Honey, you gotta wake up.

00:59.157 --> 01:00.199
Wanna play?

01:00.283 --> 01:02.451
- One, two, three?
- I'll go first.

01:02.535 --> 01:03.869
And one.

01:05.495 --> 01:06.872
- Pass.
- Why?

01:06.956 --> 01:08.999
Because I'm not Anna Nicole Smith. Next.

01:09.082 --> 01:11.083
- Two.
- Pass.

01:11.293 --> 01:13.586
- Why?
- Because I'm not Mary Kay Letourneau.

01:13.628 --> 01:14.753
Okay.

01:15.338 --> 01:17.256
- What are you looking for?
- My new husband.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.300
She's already passed up
two good prospects.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.510
- But I'm feeling good about number three.
- Do I want to know?

01:22.594 --> 01:24.887
Luke came to the table.
Is he number three?

01:24.971 --> 01:26.764
- No.
- You don't know what we're doing.

01:26.806 --> 01:30.100
The safest answer in anything
involving both of you is no.

01:30.184 --> 01:32.102
We're playing
'One, two, three, he's yours. '

01:32.144 --> 01:34.729
- I didn't ask.
- You can take the first guy that walks by.

01:34.813 --> 01:38.983
Or if you to pass, assuming there's
a better one, you can take the next guy.

01:39.067 --> 01:42.361
If you don't take him, you're automatically
stuck with the third guy.

01:42.445 --> 01:43.862
- Got it?
- I'm not playing.

01:43.946 --> 01:45.947
Of course not. It's still my turn.

01:46.031 --> 01:49.242
Guy number three
is crossing the street right now.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.787
- Why am I looking?
- Because it's like a train wreck.

01:52.829 --> 01:54.914
- Oh, no!
- Daddy.

01:54.997 --> 01:57.290
- Not Kirk.
- Maybe he'll buy me a pony.

01:57.374 --> 01:59.667
I wanna go back to the old guy.

02:02.796 --> 02:05.631
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.094
- What?
- Nothing.

02:10.176 --> 02:13.221
Okay, did someone put
the 'kick me' sign on my back again?

02:13.305 --> 02:16.140
It wasn't funny last week
and it's not funny now.

02:16.808 --> 02:18.267
I have asthma.

02:19.852 --> 02:23.855
- Mom, look, he's leaving.
- No, Kirk, come back, I love you. Drat!

02:24.106 --> 02:25.482
All right, your turn.

02:25.565 --> 02:28.692
I don't know. You already got Kirk.
How's a girl to top that?

02:28.776 --> 02:30.777
You're right. He's yours.

02:31.028 --> 02:32.362
And one...

02:37.659 --> 02:39.660
Okay, so, we should order.

02:40.704 --> 02:42.580
Yeah, ordering's good.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.763 --> 03:52.266
- Independence Inn. Michel speaking.
- Yes, is Ms. Gilmore there?

03:52.349 --> 03:54.976
I'm sorry, she's busy.
How may I assist you?

03:55.060 --> 03:58.396
Actually, I need to talk to Ms. Gilmore.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.190
- Is this business or personal?
- Personal.

04:03.442 --> 04:05.652
Is anybody there? Hello?

04:05.736 --> 04:06.945
Yes, hello? Hi?

04:07.028 --> 04:08.696
- Lorelai?
- Max!

04:08.988 --> 04:11.740
- Is this a bad time?
- No such thing. Where are you?

04:11.824 --> 04:14.576
I am in the teachers' lounge.

04:14.618 --> 04:16.619
- What are you wearing?
- Nothing.

04:16.661 --> 04:18.704
- You must be very popular.
- And chilly.

04:18.789 --> 04:21.833
- We had a chat date tonight.
- I was thinking about something...

04:21.916 --> 04:24.251
- and I wanted to run it by you.
- Okay.

04:24.335 --> 04:26.586
- So...
- Make a gorilla sound.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.713
- Why?
- I wanna play Wild Kingdom.

04:28.797 --> 04:30.715
I am not making a gorilla sound.

04:30.799 --> 04:33.676
I'll tell you what color underwear
I'm wearing.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.095
Had you considering the gorilla sound,
didn't I?

04:36.179 --> 04:37.930
- Yep.
- I'm good.

04:38.014 --> 04:41.266
Okay, I need you to be serious now.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.018
Says the man with no pants.

04:43.101 --> 04:46.729
We have been having these
very successful phone calls...

04:46.813 --> 04:48.981
- for a couple of weeks now.
- Yes, we have.

04:49.065 --> 04:51.733
I think that all the talking
has done us a lot of good.

04:51.817 --> 04:52.984
Yes, it has.

04:53.068 --> 04:57.363
So I was thinking that maybe
this weekend, instead of a phone call...

04:57.447 --> 05:00.074
we should have a date. Let's have dinner.

05:00.575 --> 05:03.077
- In the same restaurant?
- At the same table.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.745
- Interesting idea.
- I think it's time.

05:05.913 --> 05:07.789
You know what? So do I.

05:07.873 --> 05:11.125
- Saturday night? 8:00?
- Okay. Wear some pants.

05:11.751 --> 05:13.752
- I make no promises.
- Bye.

05:18.007 --> 05:20.092
- Salt and vinegar.
- Thank you.

05:20.175 --> 05:22.802
Here's your gum, soda, New Yorker,
and dental floss.

05:22.886 --> 05:25.346
- They didn't have the minty kind?
- They were out.

05:25.430 --> 05:27.390
Well, this is good, too.

05:28.474 --> 05:30.475
- He wasn't in there.
- What?

05:30.559 --> 05:32.185
Dean. He wasn't in there.

05:32.436 --> 05:34.437
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

05:34.521 --> 05:36.981
I just thought you might be.
So I mentioned it.

05:37.023 --> 05:38.816
- Well, I'm not.
- Okay.

05:38.858 --> 05:41.276
I thought you'd like to note
for future reference...

05:41.360 --> 05:43.069
that he's not in the store on Wednesdays.

05:43.153 --> 05:45.113
You can mark it on that list you're hiding...

05:45.197 --> 05:47.615
that says where he is
so you can avoid him at anytime.

05:47.699 --> 05:49.950
- I wasn't avoiding the market.
- My mistake.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.618
- I wasn't.
- Okay.

05:52.411 --> 05:54.537
So, what are you doing tonight?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.748
Well, homework, and then homework...

05:56.832 --> 06:00.001
and if I get all that done in time,
some homework. You?

06:00.085 --> 06:01.794
I have to meet my science partner.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.879
- Fun.
- Yes, science is fun.

06:04.255 --> 06:06.131
- I'll call you later?
- Okay.

06:07.007 --> 06:08.424
- Hey, Lane?
- Yeah?

06:08.509 --> 06:11.136
- You sure he wasn't in there?
- I asked.

06:20.561 --> 06:22.020
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

06:22.396 --> 06:24.981
- Shopping?
- I had a couple of things to pick up.

06:25.065 --> 06:26.357
- At the Cat Club?
- Yeah.

06:26.441 --> 06:28.484
- At the Cat Club?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

06:28.568 --> 06:33.363
Okay. I just never took you for a cat lover
or a 97-year-old woman.

06:33.405 --> 06:34.864
- What'd you buy?
- Nothing.

06:34.907 --> 06:36.366
- But you got a bag there.
- I know.

06:36.450 --> 06:40.203
It's got a cat paw stamped on it
and a catnip bow. Wise man.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.831
- Wow, potholders.
- Yes.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.126
Little kitty potholders.

06:48.085 --> 06:49.628
- They meow.
- It's a present.

06:49.711 --> 06:52.004
- For someone you hate?
- It's Rachel's birthday.

06:52.088 --> 06:55.507
Don't say anything. She doesn't want
anyone to know. She hates birthdays.

06:55.591 --> 06:59.177
- Not as much as she'll hate the potholders.
- I don't know how to buy gifts.

06:59.261 --> 07:01.721
I don't like to buy gifts.
I don't like getting gifts.

07:01.763 --> 07:05.599
This whole gift-giving-and-getting process
is completely insane.

07:05.683 --> 07:07.893
- The rant begins.
- Suddenly, on a certain date...

07:07.935 --> 07:09.769
the level of my affection for a person...

07:09.854 --> 07:12.814
isn't measured by the way I treat them
or what we share.

07:12.898 --> 07:16.192
Just because I didn't buy her furry slippers
or a giant shoetree...

07:16.276 --> 07:19.236
- all of a sudden, I suck.
- Luke, stop.

07:19.279 --> 07:22.365
You know, you cannot give her
these potholders.

07:22.656 --> 07:23.823
I know.

07:23.908 --> 07:27.411
- Go to the mall, walk around a little.
- No malls. I hate malls.

07:27.494 --> 07:28.578
Rant number two.

07:28.662 --> 07:31.080
They underpay employees
and overprice merchandise.

07:31.164 --> 07:33.916
They contribute to urban sprawl.
They encourage materialism.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.543
The parking's a horror.
You drive in, you pay a buck.

07:36.627 --> 07:40.713
- Even if you're only there for five...
- Okay, Emma Goldman, I'll tell you what.

07:40.755 --> 07:43.340
- I'll go for you.
- You're gonna shop for me?

07:43.424 --> 07:45.592
I have the day off tomorrow.
I was gonna go anyway.

07:45.676 --> 07:48.553
- You're serious?
- I'll get a bunch of stuff, all returnable.

07:48.637 --> 07:51.597
I'll bring it, you pick what you want,
and the rest I'll return.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.600
I'll do the work.
All you have to do is point.

07:53.683 --> 07:56.518
- One finger. Preferably, your index.
- I don't know.

07:56.603 --> 08:00.189
It's the first special occasion you both
have shared since she's been back.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.941
- Don't you wanna give something nice?
- I am taking her out to dinner.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.527
Yeah, I know.
I gotta get her something nice.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.279
So then let me help.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.781
- All right. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.492
Nothing too 'out there,' okay?
She's not into all that trendy stuff.

08:14.576 --> 08:18.954
She likes simple, clean nature.
Elephants, candles, okay?

08:19.789 --> 08:22.583
If you can find a candle
shaped like an elephant...

08:22.667 --> 08:25.252
Okay, you know what?
I've got it all under control.

08:25.336 --> 08:27.629
- Okay, thanks.
- Get rid of these.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.885
Hello? Lane, are you here?

08:35.970 --> 08:37.011
Jeez!

08:37.096 --> 08:40.472
Who are you? Why you call Lane?
How you know Lane? You date her?

08:40.557 --> 08:41.682
- You try to?
- No.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.977
Then why are you here?
Empty your pockets.

08:44.019 --> 08:46.562
- Okay, I'm gonna go now.
- Dean, wait.

08:46.646 --> 08:47.938
- Who's Dean?
- I'm Dean.

08:47.980 --> 08:49.981
- How you know him?
- We go to school together.

08:50.024 --> 08:52.526
- You do?
- Yeah, we're science partners.

08:52.609 --> 08:54.402
- You don't talk!
- Sorry.

08:54.486 --> 08:55.945
Science partners?

08:55.987 --> 08:58.489
- Yes, I invited him over to work.
- Work?

08:58.531 --> 09:01.825
- On our science project.
- Reproduction?

09:02.368 --> 09:04.286
Spores, molds, and fungus.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.662
- Science project?
- Yes.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.788
- For school?
- Yes.

09:06.872 --> 09:08.289
- You're not dating?
- No.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.957
Okay. Follow me.

09:17.464 --> 09:19.966
You, sit here! You, sit here!

09:20.550 --> 09:21.759
I'm going over there.

09:21.843 --> 09:24.386
When I come back,
these chairs will be in same place.

09:24.470 --> 09:26.847
- No moving. You understand?
- Yes, Mamma.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.474
- Not you, him.
- Yes, I understand.

09:34.396 --> 09:36.689
I see all.

09:41.694 --> 09:44.112
- So that's your mom?
- That's my mom.

09:44.196 --> 09:46.656
- Has she seen Patton?
- She gets uptight about boys.

09:46.740 --> 09:48.950
- I sensed that.
- It's nothing personal.

09:49.033 --> 09:51.201
I'm sure once she gets to know me, she'll...

09:51.244 --> 09:54.496
No, she'll hate you forever.
It's just nothing personal.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.206
We should probably get started.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.291
- Chapter 12?
- Sounds good.

10:05.881 --> 10:08.174
- Is this weird for you?
- A little.

10:08.258 --> 10:09.467
Me, too.

10:10.636 --> 10:13.471
I didn't know if Rory told you
to hate me or something.

10:13.555 --> 10:15.848
- That's not Rory.
- Yeah, I know.

10:18.893 --> 10:21.103
- How is she?
- Good.

10:21.562 --> 10:23.897
Goodish. Less 'good' than 'ish. '

10:24.022 --> 10:26.482
Yeah? How much less?

10:26.566 --> 10:28.859
- We're breaking our agreement.
- What agreement?

10:28.901 --> 10:30.610
Our agreement not to talk about Rory.

10:30.695 --> 10:32.988
We didn't have an agreement
not to talk about Rory.

10:33.072 --> 10:34.531
It was an unspoken agreement.

10:34.615 --> 10:37.200
It was really unspoken
'cause nobody spoke it.

10:37.284 --> 10:40.912
If we have to study together, it would
be better if we didn't discuss Rory.

10:40.995 --> 10:42.162
Fine.

10:45.374 --> 10:47.876
- She can't go in to the market.
- Why not?

10:47.918 --> 10:50.044
- Because you're there.
- Not on Wednesdays.

10:50.128 --> 10:51.629
Already noted.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.882
Can I ask you a really personal question?

10:54.966 --> 10:56.634
You can ask. I might not answer.

10:56.717 --> 10:59.219
Do you think you and Rory
will ever get back together?

10:59.303 --> 11:02.889
I vote we go back
to the 'no talking about Rory' agreement.

11:02.973 --> 11:05.224
Look, I'm just saying that I...

11:07.810 --> 11:10.145
I should have called. I'm sorry.

11:14.649 --> 11:17.109
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- It doesn't matter.

11:17.193 --> 11:19.820
- I didn't think you'd want to know.
- I got it.

11:19.904 --> 11:22.781
Rory, stop.
Okay, that's the opposite of 'stop. '

11:22.865 --> 11:25.992
Forget it. You didn't tell me.
Now I know. Life goes on.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.078
- Don't be mad.
- I'm fine. I have to go.

11:42.549 --> 11:44.092
Time to get up.

11:44.509 --> 11:47.303
Hey, I have a huge dilemma
that I need your opinion on.

11:47.344 --> 11:48.428
What?

11:48.846 --> 11:52.390
Am I more beautiful today
than I was yesterday?

11:52.474 --> 11:53.558
Oh, boy.

11:53.642 --> 11:56.561
I'm not sure. At first
I looked in the mirror and thought:

11:56.644 --> 11:59.146
'Well, yes.
Definitely a huge improvement. '

11:59.230 --> 12:00.647
Can I have my pillow back?

12:00.731 --> 12:03.817
But then I thought maybe it's not
that I'm more beautiful today.

12:03.900 --> 12:08.070
Maybe I was as beautiful yesterday. Only,
I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.

12:08.154 --> 12:09.530
I'm gonna take a shower.

12:09.614 --> 12:12.908
- Hurry up and I'll drive you to school.
- No, thanks.

12:14.076 --> 12:15.619
Why so charming this morning?

12:15.702 --> 12:18.996
I had an annoying visit from
the Stars Hollow wake-up fairy.

12:19.289 --> 12:21.290
- Where's my tie?
- In your drawer.

12:21.332 --> 12:23.834
- I'm looking in the drawer.
- Check the living room.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.710
Why would it be in the living room?

12:25.794 --> 12:28.504
Because it's been seeing the doily
on the coffee table.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.882
Sorry, I did not want you
to find out this way.

12:30.966 --> 12:33.301
Don't take this personally, but get out.

12:33.343 --> 12:35.136
Okay, you're crabby.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.263
Do you know what the perfect cure
for crabbiness is?

12:38.347 --> 12:40.932
A fabulous trip to the mall.

12:41.975 --> 12:45.061
What do you say? You can blow off school
and come with me.

12:45.145 --> 12:47.939
We can shop, go to the movies,
maybe talk a little.

12:48.022 --> 12:51.274
- No, thanks.
- Come on, it might make you feel better.

12:51.358 --> 12:53.401
I feel fine, and I don't wanna shop.

12:53.485 --> 12:57.363
I know you've been in a funk over Dean,
but you have to try not to dwell on it.

12:57.405 --> 12:58.989
I'm gonna be late for school.

12:59.073 --> 13:01.616
Okay. Then just meet me in town
around 4:00.

13:01.701 --> 13:04.161
We'll get some Indian food
and spoil our dinner.

13:04.203 --> 13:06.913
- Whatever.
- Hey, love the enthusiasm.

13:07.164 --> 13:09.457
Does Up With People know about you?

13:11.668 --> 13:13.628
Luke's. Yeah, hang on.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.716
Okay, yeah, cheeseburger, fries, well...

13:22.635 --> 13:26.680
Vanilla shake, coke. Yes, we have salad.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.683
One salad with blue cheese,
one with ranch. Got it. 20 minutes.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.059
What the hell is this?

13:32.102 --> 13:34.604
The results of my shopping trip,
all done in two hours.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.897
- Impossible.
- I'm a savant.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.648
- Everything's returnable?
- Yes, now sit down and relax.

13:38.733 --> 13:41.193
- I'll show you what I got.
- Can I have my credit card?

13:41.235 --> 13:42.360
Fine.

13:45.363 --> 13:46.906
- Looks tired.
- Where's Rachel?

13:46.990 --> 13:48.741
- She's out running some errands.
- Good.

13:48.783 --> 13:51.952
Last week, we were talking about
Meryl Streep and the accent thing.

13:52.036 --> 13:55.580
Rachel said she loved Out of Africa,
but she never read the book, remember?

13:55.664 --> 13:58.624
- No.
- Okay, so I was like:

13:59.292 --> 14:02.544
'Are you crazy?
Isak Dinesen is amazing. I love her'...

14:02.628 --> 14:04.838
which is crap
'cause I never read the book either.

14:04.922 --> 14:08.883
But Rory told me it was amazing. So I felt
pretty confident in my recommendation of:

14:08.967 --> 14:10.676
- Out of Africa.
- You bought her a book?

14:10.760 --> 14:14.805
No, you bought her a book,
to be put in her brand-new...

14:15.848 --> 14:17.849
- camera bag.
- She's got a camera bag.

14:17.933 --> 14:19.100
- It's nylon.
- So?

14:19.184 --> 14:22.478
This one's leather. Beautiful leather.
Feel it. Smell it.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.105
I'm not gonna smell that bag.

14:24.189 --> 14:26.857
Don't smell it.
But trust me, she's gonna love it.

14:26.941 --> 14:29.943
Her old bag is falling apart,
so she was gonna get a new one.

14:30.027 --> 14:31.778
Now you'll have beaten her to it.

14:31.862 --> 14:34.155
- So it's practical.
- And pretty.

14:34.489 --> 14:37.575
- That seems right.
- You like?

14:38.785 --> 14:40.536
- Yeah, thanks.
- Good.

14:41.621 --> 14:43.914
- What's all this?
- Well, Luke...

14:44.331 --> 14:46.999
- timing is a beautiful thing.
- It is?

14:47.084 --> 14:49.794
It is. So I'm at the mall
and already found Rachel's gifts.

14:49.836 --> 14:51.504
I've had two sugar-cinnamon pretzels.

14:51.588 --> 14:54.006
I'm buzzed on the sugar
and jazzed with the purchases.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.091
I take a victory lap
through Bloomingdale's...

14:56.133 --> 14:59.844
and it just so happens there was
an amazing sale in the men's department.

14:59.928 --> 15:02.513
I mean, gorgeous stuff. Look at this.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.058
40% off! I got three different colors.

15:06.142 --> 15:07.267
- For who?
- For you.

15:07.310 --> 15:08.352
- For me?
- Yeah.

15:08.436 --> 15:11.271
Then, of course, beautiful pants, so soft.

15:11.313 --> 15:13.981
I don't know what this fabric is,
but I wanna have its baby.

15:14.065 --> 15:16.608
- Hold on a minute.
- Also, I got this fabulous belt...

15:16.693 --> 15:18.819
to go with the sweater and pants.
Simple. Black.

15:18.903 --> 15:20.946
- But look at the buckle.
- I don't need a belt.

15:21.030 --> 15:23.740
- Great buckle. 60% off. Can you believe it?
- I can't. Look...

15:23.824 --> 15:26.451
Also, I picked up a couple of shirty shirts...

15:26.493 --> 15:28.828
if you didn't have a nice one
to go with your suit.

15:28.870 --> 15:30.079
What suit?

15:30.788 --> 15:32.956
- This one!
- Did no one at the mall notice...

15:33.040 --> 15:35.375
you were going through
a psychotic episode?

15:35.459 --> 15:37.293
This suit, 175% off.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.170
You're not supposed
to be shopping for me.

15:39.254 --> 15:42.465
I thought you'd like something new
to wear when you take Rachel out.

15:42.507 --> 15:43.758
Thank you, but take it back.

15:43.841 --> 15:45.217
- Just try them on.
- No way.

15:45.301 --> 15:47.844
- You might like how you look.
- I'm fine with my clothes.

15:47.928 --> 15:50.972
Okay, see this blazer? It was 175,000% off.

15:51.056 --> 15:54.225
- Why the sudden need to dress me?
- I thought you might look nice...

15:54.309 --> 15:56.644
- and since they were 600,000% off...
- No.

15:56.686 --> 15:58.646
Come on, Luke! Just try something on.

15:58.687 --> 16:00.188
- How about this sweater?
- No.

16:00.272 --> 16:03.524
- How about the pants? Pretty pants!
- I'm not trying anything on.

16:03.608 --> 16:07.444
The lumberjack look will never go out.
Won't it be nice not to be dressed...

16:07.528 --> 16:09.696
like an extra in
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers?

16:09.739 --> 16:11.532
- Take it back.
- Come on, just the jacket.

16:11.615 --> 16:14.826
Just once, be too sexy for your shirt
and do a dance on the catwalk.

16:14.910 --> 16:16.578
Get away from me, you mental patient!

16:17.245 --> 16:20.372
If we read his works in order,
we can see his progression...

16:20.456 --> 16:24.376
from a narrative of clear simplicity
to one of rich complexity.

16:24.668 --> 16:27.670
Now, this is not homework.
But I strongly urge you...

16:27.754 --> 16:31.507
if you have not already read
The Art of Fiction, read it.

16:31.674 --> 16:34.885
It's a remarkable manifesto
that contains basic truths...

16:34.969 --> 16:37.721
that still apply to fiction in any form.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.600
All right. So, Henry James,
the man of the moment.

16:42.058 --> 16:43.976
Pick your book, read it carefully.

16:44.060 --> 16:47.771
A full report on my desk
one week from today. Any questions?

16:48.898 --> 16:50.983
Ms. Gilmore, any questions?

16:55.153 --> 16:56.821
- Ms. Gilmore?
- Yes?

16:57.071 --> 16:59.906
- Did you hear the assignment?
- No, I'm sorry.

16:59.949 --> 17:01.909
Henry James. Pick your novel.

17:01.951 --> 17:04.869
A report on my desk in one week.
You got it?

17:05.119 --> 17:07.538
- Yes, I got it.
- See you tomorrow.

17:10.415 --> 17:12.084
You didn't take one note.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.545
You resorting to
the osmosis theory of learning?

17:14.587 --> 17:17.464
- Why do you care?
- I don't. Just making an observation.

17:17.548 --> 17:21.718
Great. We'll build a dome over you
and jam a telescope in your head.

17:23.219 --> 17:26.179
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Okay.

17:26.305 --> 17:28.390
- Toodles.
- Ta!

17:28.766 --> 17:31.017
I'll get working on that dome.

17:34.479 --> 17:36.647
- So how are you?
- Fine.

17:36.773 --> 17:38.691
You seemed a little distracted today.

17:38.774 --> 17:40.442
I didn't sleep well last night.

17:40.484 --> 17:43.069
You've seemed to be distracted
for quite a while now.

17:43.153 --> 17:45.821
- My grades are fine.
- I'm not concerned about grades.

17:45.905 --> 17:47.781
I'm concerned about you.

17:47.824 --> 17:51.869
Look, Rory, I know you've been going
through kind of a tough time lately...

17:51.952 --> 17:54.787
and I just want you to know,
if you want to talk, I'm here.

17:54.872 --> 17:57.123
- Tough time?
- Breakups are really hard.

17:57.165 --> 17:58.416
We've all been there.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.584
- How do you know about that?
- Your mom told me.

18:00.668 --> 18:02.961
- She what?
- Please, don't be upset at her.

18:03.004 --> 18:06.632
It came out in one of our conversations.
She's very concerned, frustrated...

18:06.715 --> 18:08.675
- You've been talking to my mom?
- Yes.

18:08.759 --> 18:11.719
- Since when?
- It's been three weeks now, I guess.

18:11.803 --> 18:13.888
- Are you dating?
- No, not really.

18:13.971 --> 18:18.224
I mean, we were talking about
possibly this weekend, having dinner...

18:18.309 --> 18:20.977
You didn't know anything
about this, did you?

18:21.019 --> 18:23.771
Then the look on your face
makes perfect sense now.

18:23.813 --> 18:26.648
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring this
on you like this.

18:26.733 --> 18:28.109
It's fine. Don't worry.

18:28.192 --> 18:31.611
- I'm sure she was gonna tell you soon.
- I'm sure, too.

18:32.529 --> 18:33.988
Okay. So...

18:34.072 --> 18:35.364
- Bus.
- Excuse me?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.491
- Lf I don't go, I'm gonna miss it.
- Go ahead.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.535
- Thanks for the talk.
- Any time.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.334
- Come on!
- I hate you very much.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.336
Save the sweet talk for Rachel.
Get out here!

18:51.212 --> 18:53.880
Excuse me, sir,
do you know where Luke is?

18:53.965 --> 18:56.508
- Very funny.
- My God, Luke, is that you?

18:56.592 --> 18:58.135
I feel ridiculous.

18:58.218 --> 19:01.804
That's because you don't
have the belt on. Here.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.848
- What are you doing?
- It's called accessorizing.

19:04.891 --> 19:07.851
- I can put a belt on myself, thank you.
- Okay, sorry.

19:08.936 --> 19:10.562
- What?
- I just...

19:11.271 --> 19:13.898
I just have exceptional taste, is all.

19:14.524 --> 19:16.150
- Turn around.
- What?

19:16.234 --> 19:19.028
I just want to make sure it all fits.
Turn around.

19:19.862 --> 19:21.655
Fabio, I need the ketchup.

19:21.697 --> 19:24.032
- Can you get that guy some ketchup?
- Why me?

19:24.074 --> 19:26.659
If I spill stuff on this,
I won't be able to return it.

19:26.743 --> 19:29.537
- You are not returning those clothes.
- Yes, I am.

19:29.579 --> 19:30.830
Try on the suit again.

19:30.872 --> 19:33.499
- I tried it on twice.
- I wanna see it with the black shirt.

19:33.541 --> 19:35.667
I'm not wearing a black suit
with a black shirt.

19:35.709 --> 19:38.002
- Regis does.
- Okay, you've won me over now.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.462
At least try on the jacket again.

19:41.464 --> 19:43.715
Is this how you like your guys,
all GQ'd up?

19:43.758 --> 19:46.343
Not GQ'd up. Just a little less casual.

19:46.427 --> 19:49.012
- And you don't like casual.
- I like casual fine.

19:49.096 --> 19:52.890
- Just not on me.
- No, it just adds variety.

19:52.974 --> 19:57.227
It's not'let's make a new Luke. '
It's'let's see another side of the old one. '

19:57.686 --> 19:59.896
You missed a loop. Come here.

20:00.939 --> 20:02.523
What did you do?

20:03.024 --> 20:05.234
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hi.

20:07.070 --> 20:10.406
- This is not what it looks like.
- It looks like you're dressing him.

20:10.489 --> 20:14.367
- Then this is exactly what it looks like.
- There was a sale at Bloomingdale's...

20:14.409 --> 20:17.661
- Six trillion percent off.
- How can you walk away from that?

20:18.580 --> 20:20.289
I'm gonna change now.

20:20.373 --> 20:23.000
Good. I'm gonna get Rory,
and just enjoy the clothes.

20:23.083 --> 20:26.377
- I will.
- Okay, good. See you later, Rachel.

20:26.795 --> 20:28.129
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:32.383 --> 20:34.343
- I'm gonna change.
- Okay.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.903
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:56.112 --> 20:59.114
I thought you might like some coffee,
since you always do.

20:59.198 --> 21:00.407
Thanks.

21:03.035 --> 21:04.911
So this feels very awkward.

21:04.953 --> 21:08.456
I'm a big girl, Lane. I don't need you
to protect me from things.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.958
I didn't want to make you
any sadder than you are.

21:11.042 --> 21:14.128
How is telling me Dean is your
study partner gonna make me sadder?

21:14.211 --> 21:16.045
I don't wanna bring up his name
around you.

21:16.130 --> 21:17.923
- That's crazy.
- Have you seen your face...

21:17.964 --> 21:19.715
- when you mention Dean?
- My face is fine.

21:19.799 --> 21:21.675
It's not. Your face is far from fine.

21:21.759 --> 21:23.760
- I'll get over it.
- You're not over it yet.

21:23.845 --> 21:26.430
Maybe I'd get over it quicker
if everyone weren't so busy...

21:26.514 --> 21:29.725
trying to protect me from all the bad,
scary things in the world.

21:29.808 --> 21:32.602
- Fine, I won't protect you anymore.
- Great. Glad to hear it.

21:32.644 --> 21:36.147
Next time we walk down the street
and you're about to walk into traffic...

21:36.230 --> 21:38.732
- I'll give you a push.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

21:38.816 --> 21:40.484
In the spirit of not protecting you...

21:40.567 --> 21:43.527
I was gonna tell you
I couldn't study'cause I had Bible class.

21:43.612 --> 21:45.405
But that's not true. I have to meet Dean.

21:45.488 --> 21:48.031
- Thanks for the honesty.
- I'll have to see him again...

21:48.116 --> 21:50.284
- 'cause the project's due Monday.
- I don't care.

21:50.326 --> 21:51.660
I'll see you when I see you.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.744
- Fine!
- Fine.

21:52.828 --> 21:53.870
Bye.

21:57.791 --> 21:59.792
- Where's Lane going?
- Away.

22:00.126 --> 22:02.336
Okay, you've been in this mood
for a week now...

22:02.378 --> 22:04.755
and while I love the ups and downs
of motherhood...

22:04.838 --> 22:07.757
I gotta say, I'm tired of Goofus,
and I'd like my Gallant back.

22:07.841 --> 22:12.052
You can't say a normal sentence, right?
Just 'hey, let's talk' is too dull for you.

22:12.345 --> 22:14.013
- Hey, let's talk.
- About what?

22:14.096 --> 22:16.347
Wait, I know.
How about you and Mr. Medina?

22:16.390 --> 22:18.641
- What?
- I heard you've gotten back together again.

22:18.684 --> 22:19.684
Did you talk to Max?

22:19.768 --> 22:22.687
He had me stay after class
to talk about my breakup situation.

22:22.771 --> 22:26.274
We are not dating. We've been talking,
and we now decided to start dating.

22:26.357 --> 22:28.191
Why didn't you tell me
you've been talking?

22:28.234 --> 22:31.111
Because it was so much like
the Todd and Nevena Cutler thing.

22:31.195 --> 22:32.863
- What?
- When I was in junior high...

22:32.946 --> 22:35.990
I had a boyfriend, Todd something
or other. Not a soul mate.

22:36.074 --> 22:38.492
But I was crazy about him,
and he dumped me.

22:38.534 --> 22:41.661
I was completely crushed
and could only lie around and cry...

22:41.704 --> 22:44.206
and listen to Air Supply.
A very low point in my life.

22:44.248 --> 22:46.333
Two days later, my best friend,
Nevena Cutler...

22:46.416 --> 22:48.501
got back with her boyfriend,
Randy something...

22:48.585 --> 22:50.461
who dumped her days before
Todd dumped me.

22:50.545 --> 22:52.379
She was so happy and gloaty...

22:52.421 --> 22:55.381
and kept talking how great it was
to have her boyfriend back...

22:55.424 --> 22:57.759
- that it made me feel horrible.
- The end. Let's go.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.220
Look, I didn't want
to be Nevena Cutler, okay?

23:00.303 --> 23:03.055
You were so miserable about Dean.
What was I supposed to do?

23:03.139 --> 23:06.391
Say, 'Sorry about you and Dean.
But I got Max back and are we happy. '

23:06.434 --> 23:08.268
- Would that be good?
- That would be great.

23:08.352 --> 23:10.228
I was going to tell you, okay?

23:10.270 --> 23:13.731
I just wanted to give you some space
and a chance to come up for air.

23:13.815 --> 23:16.859
I was trying to protect you. That's all.

23:16.901 --> 23:21.071
It doesn't matter if you tell me about Max
or not. You'll break up again anyway.

23:21.113 --> 23:22.864
- Excuse me.
- That's what you do best.

23:22.906 --> 23:24.031
Stop right there.

23:24.116 --> 23:26.409
You'll break up, cry,
get back together, break up.

23:26.451 --> 23:29.328
It doesn't really matter.
I'd rather not have to keep track.

23:29.412 --> 23:31.538
So tell me when you're down
to the final inning.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.957
That is way too snotty a thing
even for alternate-universe Rory to say.

23:35.042 --> 23:38.253
- I'd like an apology.
- Fine, I apologize. Let's go home.

23:38.336 --> 23:41.380
Yeah. Let's go home
and try that apology again.

23:42.798 --> 23:45.216
- What are you doing?
- We need light bulbs.

23:45.259 --> 23:47.636
- We're fine.
- We're in the dark. It'll take a minute.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.762
- I assume you won't come in.
- Is it Wednesday?

23:49.846 --> 23:51.472
- No.
- Then I can't, can I?

23:51.556 --> 23:53.390
What does Wednesday
have to do with this?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.434
Nothing. I'll meet you at home.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.859
Rory, I'm back for round two.

24:06.778 --> 24:10.239
I got some Silly String
in case things get really ugly.

24:18.037 --> 24:19.538
Where are you?

24:24.626 --> 24:26.127
Answer, please.

24:32.049 --> 24:35.468
This is the fourth ridiculous gathering
you've dragged me to this week.

24:35.511 --> 24:37.804
I'm the president of the board.
I have to be there.

24:37.888 --> 24:40.515
Saving the Bowringenee pansy.
Who's heard of such a thing?

24:40.599 --> 24:43.935
It's a rare flower that's disappearing
from the face of this earth.

24:43.976 --> 24:44.976
Who cares?

24:45.061 --> 24:48.605
As President of the Horticultural Society,
I have to care.

24:48.689 --> 24:52.692
The last thing I need is to spend four hours
being bored out of my skull...

24:52.776 --> 24:57.113
by the same people I'll be bored by
tomorrow at the Symphony Fundraiser.

24:57.155 --> 25:00.282
We need to get your tux back
from the cleaners tomorrow.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.617
No, I'll be dead tomorrow.

25:01.658 --> 25:04.201
I plan on flinging myself
off the roof tonight...

25:04.286 --> 25:06.829
right in the middle
of Pitty Salenger's opening speech.

25:06.913 --> 25:09.331
Pitty is a dear friend,
and you will be nice to her.

25:09.374 --> 25:12.418
She is a dipsomaniac.
I'm going to bring my newspaper.

25:12.501 --> 25:15.795
You will do no such thing, Richard.
Do you hear me?

25:19.674 --> 25:21.759
- Rory.
- Hi, Grandma.

25:26.597 --> 25:29.265
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

25:31.059 --> 25:34.061
- Richard, pay the cab.
- Cab? Who took a cab?

25:34.145 --> 25:36.647
- Rory did.
- What's Rory doing here?

25:38.774 --> 25:39.858
- Hello, Rory.
- Hi.

25:39.942 --> 25:43.153
I don't know what she's doing here.
Pay the man, and I'll find out.

25:43.195 --> 25:44.821
For Pete's sake.

25:45.363 --> 25:46.739
Come inside.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.535
Now, tell me, what is going on?

25:54.413 --> 25:55.830
I had a fight with Mom.

25:55.872 --> 25:59.083
- You had a fight with your mother?
- I just couldn't take it anymore.

25:59.167 --> 26:01.460
- I had to get out of there.
- Out of your house?

26:01.544 --> 26:05.213
Out of that house, that town, everything.
I just had to go.

26:05.547 --> 26:08.382
He tacked on an extra $5 just for waiting.

26:08.717 --> 26:10.426
I feel like I'm back in Prague.

26:10.510 --> 26:13.012
- Do you want a cocktail?
- No, thanks.

26:13.054 --> 26:16.014
- Richard!
- Sorry.

26:16.056 --> 26:19.642
- I'm just a little confused here.
- You're all dressed up.

26:19.768 --> 26:21.853
You were going out. I'm so sorry.

26:21.895 --> 26:24.313
- Please, don't be.
- It doesn't matter, Rory.

26:24.397 --> 26:27.065
Sorry. Please go out.
I didn't mean to ruin your evening.

26:27.149 --> 26:29.943
- I didn't think. I should've called.
- You calm down, right now.

26:30.027 --> 26:33.279
You don't need to call before you
come here. You are welcome any time.

26:33.363 --> 26:35.072
Tonight especially.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.992
- You want to talk about what happened?
- Emily, don't pry.

26:38.075 --> 26:41.869
- I'm not prying.
- The girl obviously needs some peace.

26:41.912 --> 26:44.038
- How do you know that?
- I can tell.

26:44.081 --> 26:45.957
You're a mind reader now. How nice.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.584
We'll get you a turban
and a booth by the train station.

26:48.668 --> 26:51.378
Would it be okay if I stay here tonight?

26:51.963 --> 26:54.423
- Of course.
- You can stay as long as you want.

26:54.506 --> 26:56.132
- Thanks.
- Would you like some dinner?

26:56.216 --> 26:57.842
I can get Rosa to make you something.

26:57.926 --> 27:01.637
- No, I'd just like to go to bed if that's okay.
- Of course. Whatever you like.

27:01.721 --> 27:05.557
Your room's all ready. There are pajamas
and a new toothbrush in the bathroom.

27:05.599 --> 27:07.600
It's pink, with sparkles.

27:07.976 --> 27:10.394
- I thought you'd like it.
- Thanks.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.900
- Good night, Grandpa.
- Good night, Rory.

27:19.028 --> 27:22.280
Everything's going to be fine.
Richard, say something encouraging.

27:22.322 --> 27:24.949
Rory, I'm sorry you're upset...

27:25.700 --> 27:27.743
but I applaud your timing.

27:28.453 --> 27:30.079
See you tomorrow.

27:31.247 --> 27:33.457
Emily, what is all this about?

27:34.333 --> 27:36.543
She had a fight with Lorelai.

27:37.419 --> 27:39.087
And she came here.

27:42.214 --> 27:44.841
Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai. Is Lane there?

27:45.217 --> 27:47.177
Do you know where she is?

27:47.260 --> 27:49.637
That's unbelievable.
You always know where she is.

27:49.679 --> 27:52.264
The one time I need you
to be crazy prison guard lady...

27:52.348 --> 27:54.391
you're all, 'Hey, man, whatever. '

27:54.892 --> 27:58.311
You know what? I'll never be able
to explain that to your satisfaction.

27:58.395 --> 28:02.773
So could you ask Lane to call me
when she gets back? I'm looking for Rory.

28:02.816 --> 28:06.027
No, I don't know where she is.
Don't 'ha' me.

28:06.110 --> 28:08.612
You don't know where Lane is, either.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.030
Anything?

28:10.114 --> 28:12.491
Patty hasn't seen her
but she's been working all day.

28:12.574 --> 28:14.242
She's not at the library or at Luke's.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.119
Where is she?
Why didn't she leave a note?

28:16.161 --> 28:17.370
- Damn it!
- Honey, calm down.

28:17.453 --> 28:20.038
But Rory doesn't take off.
She knows it'll make me crazy.

28:20.122 --> 28:23.333
She knows it would make me worry.
I'm crossing over into panic now.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.460
No, don't cross. Come back.

28:28.004 --> 28:30.547
- You find her?
- No, nothing. No one's seen her.

28:30.631 --> 28:31.715
Okay.

28:32.174 --> 28:34.676
- What about that old boyfriend of hers?
- Dean.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.261
I'm on my way.

28:36.970 --> 28:39.680
Good suggestion. You get crisis points.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.808
- Max, I'm freaking out.
- It's gonna be okay.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.685
Sookie's here, I'm here. We will find her.

28:49.523 --> 28:50.523
Rory?

28:50.607 --> 28:52.858
I just want you to know
that Rory is here with us.

28:52.901 --> 28:55.486
- What?
- She arrived a few minutes ago.

28:55.737 --> 28:58.364
- She's there? Is she okay?
- She's fine.

28:58.531 --> 29:00.199
She asked to spend the night.

29:00.282 --> 29:03.868
Okay, she's there with you.
So how did she get there?

29:03.952 --> 29:06.370
- She took a cab.
- Let me talk to her.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.164
She seems quite upset.
She said you'd had a fight.

29:09.207 --> 29:11.542
- We had a disagreement.
- She said fight.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.543
Will you put her on the phone,
please, Mom?

29:13.585 --> 29:16.170
I think we should give her time
to collect herself.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.965
Thank you for your input.
Can I please talk to my daughter?

29:19.048 --> 29:22.217
- She went to her room, Lorelai.
- Her room is here.

29:22.468 --> 29:25.554
Mom, I'm standing here
looking at her room, and she's not in it.

29:25.638 --> 29:28.473
Lorelai, I did not come to your house
and kidnap this child.

29:28.557 --> 29:32.185
She ran from you, and she came here.
She's tired, and she's upset.

29:32.227 --> 29:33.936
I think we should just let her sleep...

29:34.020 --> 29:37.523
and in the morning, we can argue about
how to best handle the situation.

29:37.565 --> 29:40.734
Maybe some time away from each other
will do you both good.

29:40.817 --> 29:42.568
I'll pick her up in the morning.

29:42.652 --> 29:45.696
She has school tomorrow,
and her school's 10 minutes from here.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.197
I'll pick her up after school.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.075
Why don't you call tomorrow
when she gets back from school?

29:50.117 --> 29:53.203
Make sure she wants to go.
You don't want to haul her back home...

29:53.286 --> 29:56.580
- just to have her jump in a cab again.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.165
Goodnight, Lorelai.

30:01.252 --> 30:02.294
So?

30:04.922 --> 30:07.007
- She's with my parents in Hartford.
- Good.

30:07.090 --> 30:08.799
- Good?
- Bad?

30:08.883 --> 30:10.884
- Bad. Very bad.
- She's safe.

30:10.969 --> 30:13.429
She's with my mother.
No one is safe with my mother.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.097
- She needed some space.
- No, that house is not safe.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.891
It's like The Amityville Horror
without all the good times.

30:18.934 --> 30:22.687
- Lf it's that bad, you should go get her.
- No, she wanted to get away from me.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.604
She wants to be alone.

30:24.814 --> 30:26.815
Let's give her her space.

30:32.529 --> 30:33.780
You okay?

30:33.863 --> 30:35.906
I can't believe she left me to go there.

30:35.990 --> 30:37.950
We used to always be able
to work this out.

30:38.034 --> 30:39.451
What did you two fight about?

30:39.493 --> 30:40.660
- You?
- Me?

30:40.744 --> 30:44.080
It started with you and that
I didn't tell her we were talking again...

30:44.122 --> 30:47.458
but that was only part of it
because she's been in such a bad place...

30:47.542 --> 30:51.170
with this whole Dean thing.
So I guess it was coming.

30:52.796 --> 30:54.630
I just wish she hadn't run away.

30:54.673 --> 30:58.134
She will be back,
and you two will work everything out.

30:59.010 --> 31:02.096
- You're good at the comforting thing.
- Thank you.

31:02.805 --> 31:04.765
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

31:04.807 --> 31:07.809
- Can I ask you a question?
- I think you've earned it.

31:07.851 --> 31:10.311
Why didn't you tell Rory about us?

31:10.478 --> 31:12.813
She was so upset about Dean...

31:12.856 --> 31:16.442
I didn't think it was the best time
to give her my happy news.

31:16.525 --> 31:18.985
Okay. But you've told other people?

31:19.069 --> 31:22.321
- What other people?
- I don't know, friends, Sookie?

31:22.989 --> 31:24.949
No, actually, I haven't.

31:25.325 --> 31:26.659
Any reason?

31:28.536 --> 31:29.870
It just hasn't come up.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.246
- It hasn't?
- No.

31:31.330 --> 31:33.665
You're not avoiding
talking about it, are you?

31:33.707 --> 31:34.999
No, Max, come on.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.793
- It just seems a little strange to me.
- Why is it strange?

31:37.836 --> 31:40.546
We've been talking for at least two weeks.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.673
I thought at some point
it would've come up.

31:42.756 --> 31:46.425
You don't say to people out of the blue,
'Max and I are talking again. '

31:46.510 --> 31:49.304
I was just waiting
for it to come up naturally.

31:49.346 --> 31:53.724
Somehow, for me, it managed to come up
naturally within two days three times.

31:53.808 --> 31:56.310
You're obviously a better people-person
than I am.

31:56.352 --> 31:58.895
If there's a reason
why you don't want people to know...

31:58.979 --> 32:01.189
- then we must talk about that.
- There's no reason.

32:01.273 --> 32:02.315
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

32:02.357 --> 32:04.358
- Okay.
- Do you believe me?

32:04.484 --> 32:06.861
If you said there's no reason,
there's no reason.

32:06.902 --> 32:07.986
- So you said.
- So I mean.

32:08.070 --> 32:09.112
- Okay.
- All right.

32:09.196 --> 32:10.572
That's fine.

32:12.824 --> 32:15.201
I should page Sookie
and tell her that Rory's okay.

32:15.243 --> 32:16.994
That's a good idea.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.503
- Good morning.
- Rory, good morning.

32:27.587 --> 32:30.547
Grandma, any thoughts
on where my skirt might be?

32:30.590 --> 32:33.342
I gave it to Rosa to press.
Sit down. Have some breakfast.

32:33.384 --> 32:36.553
Your skirt will be done
by the time you're finished.

32:36.637 --> 32:40.598
Now, we have eggs, fruit, toast...

32:40.849 --> 32:44.060
- pancakes, and blintzes.
- Anything would be fine.

32:44.143 --> 32:47.020
- What do you usually eat?
- Mostly I just grab a Pop-Tart.

32:47.062 --> 32:49.939
That sounds delicious.
I'll have Rosa whip one up for you.

32:50.023 --> 32:52.900
- No, eggs would be great.
- I'll go tell her.

32:55.236 --> 32:58.196
So, Grandpa,
what's new in the world today?

32:58.280 --> 33:00.782
As usual, it's going to hell in a handbasket.

33:00.866 --> 33:03.785
It's nice to have something
you can always count on.

33:03.869 --> 33:05.370
It is, at that.

33:05.829 --> 33:08.414
- Would you like part of the paper?
- Please.

33:08.498 --> 33:11.083
- Your eggs will be right out.
- Thanks.

33:14.419 --> 33:17.880
- So, did you sleep well?
- The bed was very comfortable.

33:18.381 --> 33:19.757
But you didn't sleep well?

33:19.841 --> 33:22.885
- No, I did. I just...
- I talked to your mother last night.

33:22.968 --> 33:26.137
I told her you'd stay here.
She said she'd call this afternoon.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.597
Was she mad?

33:28.431 --> 33:30.099
She was concerned.

33:32.560 --> 33:36.146
So, do you get your lunch at school,
or do you bring it with you?

33:36.230 --> 33:38.773
Because Rosa made
a fabulous leg of lamb yesterday.

33:38.857 --> 33:42.651
- I bet it'd make a wonderful sandwich.
- Take her up on that. It is good.

33:42.736 --> 33:45.655
- And demand a slice of strudel.
- Okay.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.448
- I demand some strudel.
- Good.

33:48.824 --> 33:51.075
So, what's going on at school today?

33:51.118 --> 33:54.204
- I have a test in Spanish.
- Are you prepared?

33:54.454 --> 33:56.163
Yeah. I like Spanish.

33:56.247 --> 33:58.040
Biology, on the other hand...

33:58.124 --> 33:59.458
I'm still waiting for the day...

33:59.542 --> 34:02.961
when my knowledge of the inner workings
of a frog's intestinal system...

34:03.003 --> 34:05.338
can be applied to my work
in the insurance industry.

34:05.422 --> 34:07.924
Perhaps if you were insuring the frog.

34:10.134 --> 34:11.467
Thank you.

34:12.011 --> 34:14.096
- This looks great.
- Good.

34:15.431 --> 34:18.391
- Thanks again for letting me stay.
- It's nice having you here.

34:18.475 --> 34:21.893
You got Grandpa to put down
his newspaper at breakfast. That's a first.

34:21.978 --> 34:24.271
- Now, Emily.
- Well, it is.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.447
Jeez, what happened to you?

34:34.489 --> 34:37.283
- A happy how-do-you-do to you, too.
- Sorry. You look bad.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.409
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Why not?

34:39.493 --> 34:42.579
- Rory and I had a fight, and she ran away.
- What? Where? Did you...

34:42.663 --> 34:44.121
She's fine. She's at my mother's.

34:44.206 --> 34:47.583
God! Throw that in with the first part.
You'll scare a person to death.

34:47.667 --> 34:51.128
Sorry. You know,
I got in my car three times to go get her.

34:51.212 --> 34:54.297
I drove halfway there and drove back.

34:54.380 --> 34:57.132
I actually ran out of gas
driving halfway there and back.

34:57.175 --> 34:59.677
- She'll cool off and come home.
- I know.

34:59.719 --> 35:02.179
This breaking up with Dean
has been so hard on her.

35:02.221 --> 35:05.432
I just hate that she's going through this.
She's such a good kid.

35:05.516 --> 35:08.268
She's so nice to everyone,
she cares about everyone...

35:08.351 --> 35:10.728
and she's walking around
in this unbelievable pain.

35:10.812 --> 35:12.438
There's nothing I can do about it.

35:12.522 --> 35:14.607
She won't talk to me,
or tell me what happened.

35:14.690 --> 35:16.691
I'll tell you what happened. Dean's a jerk...

35:16.775 --> 35:19.527
- and he let her know it.
- I wish I could pinch his head off.

35:19.611 --> 35:21.988
- I'll help.
- I warned him when I first met him...

35:22.030 --> 35:25.032
if he hurt her... Maybe I could key his car.

35:25.074 --> 35:27.659
Or better, you can key Taylor's car
and say Dean did it.

35:27.743 --> 35:30.787
- That'd be good.
- Then key Taylor's car, tell him Dean did it.

35:30.871 --> 35:35.291
Also tell him that Dean littered
and walks his dog without a leash.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.752
- He'll run him out of town.
- Good.

35:37.961 --> 35:41.672
All right, I should go.
Rory's probably out of school by now...

35:41.714 --> 35:44.049
and I want to be home
in case she decides to call.

35:44.133 --> 35:46.384
- Coffee's on the house.
- Thanks.

35:46.885 --> 35:49.971
- Is that the belt I bought you?
- Yeah, the old one broke.

35:50.054 --> 35:52.514
Lucky you happened to have a spare.

35:53.849 --> 35:55.600
She'll be home soon.

36:28.338 --> 36:30.172
- Got a minute?
- Actually...

36:30.256 --> 36:32.633
I just want to tell you
that I think you are scum.

36:32.716 --> 36:33.716
Gee, thanks.

36:33.759 --> 36:37.595
You'll be hard-pressed to find another girl
as fantastic as Rory. You know that?

36:37.679 --> 36:41.557
She is beautiful and smart and did not
deserve to be treated that way by you.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.767
- Treated what way?
- I thought you were a good guy.

36:43.851 --> 36:45.727
I thought you were
going to make her happy.

36:45.769 --> 36:48.020
I'm an idiot to have thought
you were a good pick.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.065
But I was wrong, and I hate to be wrong.

36:50.106 --> 36:53.442
I am sick and tired of everyone
blaming this thing on me.

36:53.484 --> 36:57.570
I mean, you and this stupid town
looking at me like I'm a criminal.

36:57.947 --> 37:02.867
I say, 'I love you,' and she just sits there,
and I'm the jerk? I'm the bad guy?

37:03.535 --> 37:05.786
- What?
- You know what? Think what you want.

37:05.870 --> 37:08.247
I don't care. Just leave me alone.

37:23.052 --> 37:25.303
- Where is she?
- I thought you were gonna call.

37:25.387 --> 37:26.429
Where is she, Mom?

37:26.471 --> 37:28.597
I haven't had any time
to prepare her for this.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.225
- Mom, where is she?
- Upstairs in her room.

37:31.309 --> 37:33.811
She got home from school,
but just went right upstairs.

37:33.894 --> 37:36.145
She didn't want a snack,
but I had Rosa make one.

37:36.230 --> 37:37.814
I haven't checked if she's eaten it.

37:37.898 --> 37:40.608
She had a decent breakfast this morning,
but seemed tired.

37:40.650 --> 37:43.193
When I went to her bathroom,
the aspirin bottle was out.

37:43.278 --> 37:45.780
I assume she had a headache.
I don't know if it was last...

37:45.863 --> 37:48.281
Excuse me, Mr. Cosell,
I appreciate the play-by-play...

37:48.324 --> 37:49.992
but I want to talk to my daughter now.

37:50.075 --> 37:53.494
- Do you want me to go in there with you?
- More than anything.

37:53.536 --> 37:56.121
- Try and be nice.
- Thanks for the tip.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.001
- Hey.
- Mom.

38:01.752 --> 38:04.546
Okay, so, I thought when you said,
'I'll see you at home'...

38:04.629 --> 38:07.673
- you meant our home. My mistake.
- I'm so sorry.

38:08.549 --> 38:09.883
It's okay.

38:10.009 --> 38:11.718
- All of those things...
- I know.

38:11.802 --> 38:13.136
- And then...
- It's no big deal.

38:13.179 --> 38:15.264
- I'm just so...
- I know, I know.

38:16.723 --> 38:20.267
The last time I saw you, you were
headed home. Wanna fill in the blanks?

38:20.351 --> 38:22.894
I don't know. I just snapped...

38:23.688 --> 38:26.315
and I got sick of everything.
I wanted to go anywhere.

38:26.357 --> 38:27.482
So you picked hell?

38:27.524 --> 38:30.860
- It was the first place that came to mind.
- I respect that.

38:31.778 --> 38:35.531
The need to run is a feeling
I am well acquainted with.

38:35.573 --> 38:38.075
But we have to be able to talk, always.

38:38.159 --> 38:40.702
No matter how mad or upset
we get with each other...

38:40.786 --> 38:44.038
our particular special thing only works
if we agree to that, get it?

38:44.122 --> 38:45.706
- I get it.
- Good.

38:47.041 --> 38:49.459
Rory, tell me what happened
with you and Dean.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.544
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I do.

38:51.629 --> 38:55.173
- Why?
- Because I had a little chat with him today.

38:55.257 --> 38:56.424
What? Why?

38:56.508 --> 38:59.343
Because I was upset
and in the mood to do a little yelling.

38:59.385 --> 39:00.719
- You didn't.
- I did.

39:00.761 --> 39:02.721
- No.
- There he was, stacking cookies...

39:02.805 --> 39:05.348
and I'm railing on him about
what a great kid you are...

39:05.432 --> 39:10.227
and how it sucked that he dumped you,
and then he said he told you he loved you.

39:10.270 --> 39:13.898
- And I started feeling a little stupid.
- He did tell me.

39:14.190 --> 39:16.984
- And you didn't say anything?
- No.

39:17.067 --> 39:20.027
- It must've been rough on him.
- He looked so hurt.

39:20.070 --> 39:23.406
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to hurt him.

39:23.531 --> 39:27.117
- I just got scared and I sat there.
- I understand.

39:28.536 --> 39:32.622
You know, I'm still learning this stuff, too.
Since I'm still learning...

39:32.706 --> 39:36.709
I think I haven't thought enough about
what I'm supposed to be teaching you.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.377
What are you talking about?

39:38.461 --> 39:42.214
I'm talking about my own personal
lack of commitment skills.

39:43.090 --> 39:47.510
I mean, look, I love that you have my eyes
and my coffee addiction...

39:48.052 --> 39:49.928
and my taste in music and movies.

39:50.013 --> 39:53.015
But when it comes
to love and relationships...

39:53.182 --> 39:56.017
I don't necessarily want you to be like me.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.438
I'd hate to think that I raised a kid
who couldn't say 'I love you. '

40:00.522 --> 40:03.065
- Mom.
- I'm not talking specifically about Dean.

40:03.107 --> 40:07.027
I mean, just generally in life. For example,
say you're dating Taylor Hanson.

40:07.111 --> 40:10.572
- Why am I dating Taylor Hanson?
- It's a hypothetical scenario. Go with it.

40:10.655 --> 40:12.948
So you and Taylor
are seeing each other regularly.

40:13.032 --> 40:15.700
- How did I meet Taylor Hanson?
- You went to his concert.

40:15.785 --> 40:20.372
You got backstage. Your eyes met across
the crowd and you're seeing each other.

40:20.456 --> 40:23.124
- Hanson's still together?
- They're the new Bee Gees.

40:23.208 --> 40:26.002
Why would you not stop me
from going to a Hanson concert?

40:26.085 --> 40:28.837
- Someone's trying to make a point here.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

40:28.921 --> 40:32.298
So you and Taylor have been dating
for a while and things are great...

40:32.383 --> 40:33.926
and you're happy.

40:34.009 --> 40:37.595
You feel all those crazy mushy things
that people feel when they're in love.

40:37.679 --> 40:42.141
I want you to be able to say to him:
'Taylor, I love you. '

40:42.391 --> 40:45.935
Can we pick a new hypothetical,
'cause this one's wigging me out?

40:45.978 --> 40:49.689
My point is that it's scary to be in love.
That much I know.

40:49.773 --> 40:54.485
But it's also wonderful and special.
And if you can't say it or fully express it...

40:54.569 --> 40:57.154
then you're never gonna
be able to experience it.

40:57.238 --> 41:01.366
I want you to experience everything
that's great because you're so great.

41:01.449 --> 41:03.909
- Are you hearing me?
- Yeah, I'm hearing you.

41:03.993 --> 41:07.120
I'm not saying you say 'I love you'
at the drop of a hat.

41:07.163 --> 41:09.706
It has to be right and real...

41:10.165 --> 41:12.708
and it has to take a lot of thought.

41:12.834 --> 41:15.502
But someday, with someone,
it will be right.

41:15.587 --> 41:18.130
I want you to be ready for that moment
when it happens.

41:18.214 --> 41:21.216
Are you ready for that moment
when it happens?

41:21.342 --> 41:22.968
I'm working on it.

41:24.094 --> 41:27.096
I do, however, know
what dress I'll be wearing.

41:28.723 --> 41:31.308
- Thank you guys so much.
- It was our pleasure.

41:31.392 --> 41:34.853
- What do I owe you for the cab?
- Don't worry about that.

41:34.937 --> 41:37.355
- Thanks for sharing your paper.
- Any time.

41:37.439 --> 41:40.983
- And thank you, Mom.
- Of course. She's our granddaughter.

41:41.067 --> 41:43.527
- All right. We'll see you tomorrow night.
- 7:00.

41:43.611 --> 41:47.447
- Really, is it 7:00, 'cause I wasn't...
- Goodbye, Lorelai.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.788
Looks like it's just the two of us again.

41:56.873 --> 41:58.207
I guess so.

42:02.377 --> 42:05.129
I was almost tempted to see
if she could make a Pop-Tart.

42:05.213 --> 42:07.965
Wow, home-cooked breakfast,
homemade lunch.

42:08.049 --> 42:10.717
I'm trying to remember why I left there.
Yeah, my parents.

42:10.801 --> 42:12.427
Funny, funny girl.

42:12.803 --> 42:14.846
- Let me out here.
- Okay.

42:15.305 --> 42:17.848
- I'll meet you back at the house.
- Excuse me?

42:17.933 --> 42:21.227
- I'll show up this time.
- I'll have the pizza waiting.

42:58.593 --> 42:59.718
Hello?

43:00.136 --> 43:05.098
Now, I'm starting with the'A's,'
so first up is Richie Andrews.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.475
He's either a second cousin
on my mother's side...

43:07.559 --> 43:09.519
or the guy who re-grouted the bathroom.

43:09.602 --> 43:12.938
Either way, I think he's gonna be thrilled
to hear about us.

43:13.356 --> 43:15.607
After I've called everyone in here...

43:15.691 --> 43:17.901
I'm gonna spread the word at the Inn.

43:18.610 --> 43:21.779
I thought I'd put little notices
in everyone's rooms...

43:21.863 --> 43:25.157
'Welcome to the Independence Inn.
Max and Lorelai are back together. '

43:25.241 --> 43:27.367
Can I see you after your dinner
tomorrow night?

43:27.451 --> 43:32.288
I don't know. I have a lot of phone calls
to make. The Internet. Let's go global!

43:32.372 --> 43:34.248
- Good night, Lorelai.
- Good night.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.633
Richie? It's Lorelai.
