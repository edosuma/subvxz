the other person has to do
the exact same thing.

-It's called flossing.

brushing my teeth and flossing,

Well, I can assure you that
none of the esteemed guests
attending this gala

07:16.644 --> 07:19.021
will be doing silly dance moves
like that.

Besides, glamorous gala guests
prefer toothpicks.

That's not fancy dancing.
At the gala, we'll be doing
really fancy dancing

in my favorite series

you do a dance move
and I'll mirror you?

Finally, a conversation
about literature.

and no funny business.
