WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.253
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.337 --> 00:04.422
<i>Katrina has chosen to</i>
<i>side with the enemy.</i>

00:10.178 --> 00:11.304
- Now.
- No!

00:16.810 --> 00:17.936
This is not your fault.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.271
No. It's yours.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.362
Katrina!

00:28.780 --> 00:29.823
Lieutenant!

00:30.782 --> 00:32.534
The Traveler Spell, it worked.

00:35.370 --> 00:36.663
<i>Clearly, she's touched.</i>

00:36.788 --> 00:38.623
Put her in shackles
so she causes no harm.

00:38.873 --> 00:39.958
I have information.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.626
There's only one
person I'll talk to...

00:42.711 --> 00:44.462
Captain Ichabod Crane.

01:25.462 --> 01:26.463
Rifle!

01:27.547 --> 01:28.548
Fire!

01:38.975 --> 01:39.976
Stay on them.

01:48.735 --> 01:51.070
Make certain 37th
receives these supplies.

01:51.529 --> 01:52.947
Front moves north in an hour.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.783
This battle's far from over.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.035
Raise your hand.

01:58.578 --> 01:59.704
It's not him.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.166
Again, any Hessian soldiers
with a mark on their hand,

02:03.249 --> 02:04.292
I want to hear of it.

02:04.876 --> 02:05.960
Captain Crane.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.170
Private.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.506
There's a woman in
holding at the fort.

02:09.589 --> 02:11.216
Claims she has important
information about the war.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.009
Who is she?
We're not certain.

02:13.593 --> 02:15.136
At first we thought her
to be a runaway slave,

02:15.220 --> 02:18.681
but her demeanor, clothing
and attitude are unusual.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.434
Very well,
have Donovan question her.

02:21.518 --> 02:23.812
He did.
She'd like to speak
with you and you alone.

02:23.895 --> 02:25.188
Well, that's unfortunate.

02:26.064 --> 02:27.816
I'm under specific orders
from the highest office

02:27.899 --> 02:29.067
not to leave the battlefield.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.944
She seemed to
know that, Captain.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.695
Said it was
about your mission.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.406
A Hessian soldier
with a bow on his hand.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.004
Oh, Crane.
Thank God you're okay.

02:50.088 --> 02:51.172
Captain Crane.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.591
Mmm.

02:53.967 --> 02:54.968
Ms?

02:55.093 --> 02:56.094
Mills. Abigail Mills, Captain.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.472
You address me
as if we've met.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.600
No, sir, we haven't met yet.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.644
But...
I was drawn from battle.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.188
Because I was told
you had information

03:07.272 --> 03:09.440
concerning a Hessian soldier
with a mark upon his hand.

03:09.524 --> 03:10.567
The Horseman.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.194
You're gonna meet him
on the battlefield very soon.

03:13.278 --> 03:14.737
Good. I shall cut him down.

03:14.821 --> 03:15.864
Agreed, you will.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.657
But he's like no
one you've ever faced.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.701
He's gonna kill you, too.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.912
Trust me, I know the endgame.
I know how this plays out.

03:22.996 --> 03:24.747
Your turn of phrase
is most confounding.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.250
Speak plainly, madam.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.128
Look, I have very
reliable information.

03:31.129 --> 03:34.215
You get me out of here,
and I'll explain everything,
okay?

03:34.299 --> 03:35.466
Ms. Mills,

03:36.009 --> 03:40.388
I can't discern
from whence you came,
but here we abide by the law.

03:40.471 --> 03:43.141
We do not get out
and then explain ourselves.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.726
The law is habeas corpus.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.687
You violated it
by locking me up
here without a cause.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.647
Only it's not
applicable to me.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.608
For another
hundred years, right?

03:53.151 --> 03:55.612
You have no
tangible information.
Good day.

03:55.695 --> 03:57.488
The Horseman is
not working alone.

03:59.991 --> 04:01.367
He has an ally now.

04:01.993 --> 04:03.328
One equally as dangerous.

04:04.162 --> 04:09.125
A woman to make sure
you die on that battlefield.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.335
Who is this ally?

04:13.796 --> 04:15.882
Captain, they're
calling for your return.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.761
It says,
"Hessian reinforcements

04:19.886 --> 04:21.095
have launched
a counterattack,"

04:21.179 --> 04:22.764
doesn't it?

04:22.847 --> 04:27.143
Their leader,
masked, on horseback,
carrying a broadax.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.396
I'm telling you,
I know things.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.106
I have faced this
Horseman before.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.525
I know his ally.
You take me with you.

04:36.069 --> 04:37.695
You cannot defeat
them without me.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.199
Ichabod?

04:42.367 --> 04:43.618
Ichabod.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.246
Has anyone seen Ichabod Crane?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.831
I heard he was
mortally wounded.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.500
Katrina,
your husband isn't here.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.418
What?

04:52.502 --> 04:53.795
He was in battle.

04:53.878 --> 04:57.757
He was cut down
by the Horseman,
and brought to this very bed.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.550
No, ma'am, Captain
Crane was called away.

05:00.218 --> 05:01.177
How?

05:01.260 --> 05:03.680
A mysterious slave woman,
claiming to
have enemy secrets.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.515
This woman,
did she mention her name?

05:06.808 --> 05:07.809
Ms. Mills, perhaps?

05:07.892 --> 05:08.977
Aye, Abigail Mills.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.354
Do you know
where they are now?

05:11.938 --> 05:12.981
They never returned.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.817
She saved him from
the worst of it we've seen.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.735
This Hessian,

05:19.737 --> 05:21.030
he was like
something from hell.

05:33.418 --> 05:35.211
Sir? Wait, wait.

05:37.255 --> 05:38.339
Whiskey?

05:38.423 --> 05:40.008
This is no time for a drink.

05:40.091 --> 05:41.551
Madam, if you cannot
handle your surroundings...

05:41.634 --> 05:42.844
Alcohol is a disinfectant.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.804
It'll do him more
good on the outside.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.060
This one.

05:54.105 --> 05:55.565
Decapitations.
Mmm-hmm.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.358
I'm sure you've noticed
the wounds are cauterized.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.444
That's impossible.

06:01.571 --> 06:03.322
Their weapons must
have been heated.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.615
Weapon.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.326
The Horseman
carries a broadax,
heated to 400 degrees.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.370
You believe one
man did all this?

06:09.454 --> 06:10.455
He's no man, he's a demon.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.457
He's Death.
All right.

06:12.957 --> 06:16.044
These men do not need
your fanciful tales,
and nor do I.

06:16.127 --> 06:18.463
Ms. Mills, precisely
what is it you're after?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.840
I'm trying to stop
the Horseman and his ally
from killing you.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.508
So listen,

06:22.592 --> 06:25.678
I know you've seen
things in this war
that you cannot explain.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.597
General Washington has
put his trust in you.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.475
He told you this
revolution isn't just a war

06:30.600 --> 06:32.393
about the future
of this country.

06:33.102 --> 06:36.564
It'll determine
the fate of every man,
woman and child.

06:36.647 --> 06:37.774
How could you
possibly know this?

06:37.857 --> 06:38.900
I do because you told me.

06:38.983 --> 06:41.319
No. No, we've never met.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.653
You're right, not yet.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.865
But we will in 200 years.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.951
I'm sorry, is this what
you've been intimating?

06:49.035 --> 06:50.078
You're from the future?

06:50.161 --> 06:51.913
I know, it sounds insane.

06:51.996 --> 06:53.706
Completely insane.
And no less insane to me.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.542
But here I am
on a revolutionary
battlefield in 1781.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.503
Look around.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.338
You would have
died if I hadn't

07:00.505 --> 07:01.964
pulled you from
this battlefield.

07:03.299 --> 07:04.884
But now we have
another problem.

07:05.510 --> 07:06.886
The fact that you didn't die

07:06.969 --> 07:09.305
may very well
have screwed up
history forever.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.265
This makes no sense.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.103
You say you're
here to save me.
Yet I'm supposed to die.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.438
You were.
You were saved,
suspended in time,

07:17.522 --> 07:21.275
until we met,
but now everything,
the fate of the country,

07:21.359 --> 07:23.486
the fate of the mission that
Washington assigned you,

07:23.569 --> 07:26.114
the fate of our
mission together.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.490
Future is off the rails.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.162
Who are you?

08:14.453 --> 08:16.372
You had no grounds
to abandon your post.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.666
Colonel Sutton,
the battle had subsided,

08:19.375 --> 08:21.711
and I was under the impression
I was to question this woman.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.087
I never gave such orders.

08:23.171 --> 08:24.172
Apologies, sir, but...

08:24.255 --> 08:26.340
Join the 12th
Regiment traveling north.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.718
And do not abandon your men
without a direct order.

08:28.801 --> 08:29.886
Sir.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.430
What will become of her?

08:33.556 --> 08:36.267
You want her?
Buy her at auction.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.102
Colonel,
that is not what I meant.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.273
She knew of
the Hessian attack.

08:43.274 --> 08:44.692
Her clothes are
of foreign design.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.485
Her accent is...

08:47.069 --> 08:49.530
It alludes to
upstate New York,
but is quite slipshod.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.951
In my estimation, she is,
or was, a British agent.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.370
What do you suggest?

08:56.454 --> 08:58.789
I take her back
to Fort Hudson,
conduct an interrogation.

08:59.332 --> 09:00.666
Then you decide
how we proceed.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.960
She is a distraction.
I need every man in the field.

09:04.462 --> 09:05.630
And her?

09:06.047 --> 09:08.090
She goes to an encampment
for runaway slaves.

09:08.174 --> 09:09.508
Then perhaps I
could transport her.

09:10.468 --> 09:12.511
It could save us another loss,
which we cannot afford.

09:13.304 --> 09:16.057
And at the very least,
provide some
answers about today.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.226
Report in the moment
you've signed for her release.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.312
Thank you, sir.
Crane.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.814
Your Oxford
degree and connections

09:23.981 --> 09:25.650
are not going to
save you next time.

09:26.317 --> 09:28.027
Deserters face a firing squad.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.053
Never realized
riding in a carriage
would be so uncomfortable.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.682
Thank you.

09:57.932 --> 09:58.933
For what?

09:59.976 --> 10:01.269
You do realize
I've been instructed

10:01.394 --> 10:02.645
to escort you
to an encampment.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.313
I saw the way that
Sutton treated you.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.857
The fact that you
went out on a limb

10:07.024 --> 10:08.693
to escort me means
that you believe me.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.736
It's three miles
to the encampment.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.905
You have until then
to bear proof to your story.

10:12.989 --> 10:14.073
What would you like to know?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.953
We win the war,
Washington becomes
the first president...

10:19.036 --> 10:21.455
Impossible. He swore
never to hold public office.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.708
But also
impossible to disprove.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.627
So if we really
are partners in...

10:27.003 --> 10:28.379
2015.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.922
The year of our Lord, 2015,

10:31.882 --> 10:33.217
what do you know of me?

10:34.176 --> 10:36.637
Well, Katrina inspired you

10:36.721 --> 10:38.806
to abandon your
allegiance with the Crown.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.933
But when Abraham Van Brunt

10:41.017 --> 10:43.811
couldn't pick out
the right engagement
necklace for her, you did.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.897
But she couldn't hide
her feelings for you anymore.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.151
And you couldn't
hide yours for her.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.238
Is this the story
His Majesty's spies
have on record?

10:54.905 --> 10:55.948
I don't know.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.908
'Cause I'm not a spy.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.244
And if I were,

11:00.578 --> 11:02.580
I'd be pretty peeved
off on the flimsiness

11:02.747 --> 11:04.707
of the "I am from
the future" cover.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.335
Suppose I were to entertain
the notion of time travel

11:07.418 --> 11:08.544
and a Horseman of Death.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.795
Hmm.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.464
What do you propose
we do in order to not,

11:11.547 --> 11:14.717
as you elegantly put it,
screw up history forever?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.677
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

11:16.761 --> 11:18.929
On the face of it,
it's an impossible situation.

11:19.930 --> 11:20.973
But that's what we do.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.350
We?
We.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.310
Yes.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.356
We take on the impossible
and we figure a way out.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.775
An intractable task.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.860
Do we have help?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.071
My sister and a captain.

11:36.030 --> 11:37.198
And we turn to...

11:40.493 --> 11:41.619
We turn to books.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.413
Mostly written by people
who are alive now.

11:44.497 --> 11:47.124
Washington,
Jefferson, Franklin.

11:47.208 --> 11:51.379
If, and I stress "if"
with extreme veracity.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.297
If I were so inclined,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.802
General Washington
and Thomas Jefferson
are in Virginia.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.720
Not an option.
What about Franklin?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.182
Recently returned from France.

12:03.516 --> 12:09.271
Honestly, if anyone
can back up my story,
help us, it's him.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.816
Franklin will
know what to do next.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.115
To Mr. Franklin!

12:20.533 --> 12:21.742
Brace yourself.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.193
I know it is you
under that mask, Abraham.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.405
I know why you are here.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.199
You are searching
for the same man as I.

13:02.992 --> 13:03.951
I know you have

13:04.034 --> 13:06.537
every reason to doubt me,
after what I did to you.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.498
But Ichabod has
betrayed me, too.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.793
He has joined
with another woman

13:12.877 --> 13:15.045
and together they're
a formidable foe to us both.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.674
So they both must die.

13:20.885 --> 13:24.054
Let me help you find them

13:25.389 --> 13:26.557
and kill them.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.367
That took a really long time
to get three miles.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.662
I suppose there
are flying carriages
in the second millennia.

13:48.746 --> 13:50.122
Only for long distances.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.874
I was being sarcastic.

13:53.334 --> 13:54.585
That's gonna be a Starbucks.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.713
A what?
Coffee house.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.216
That livery stable, too.

14:02.051 --> 14:03.677
Why?
I don't know.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.054
People drink a lot of coffee.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.432
Afternoon.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.435
Mr. Leon. Ma'am.

14:14.647 --> 14:15.814
You know them?

14:16.565 --> 14:17.566
'Tis a small town.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.819
Providing I do not die,
or become suspended in time,

14:20.903 --> 14:22.238
I'll have a lot of
explaining to do.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.782
They've never seen
a woman in trousers.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.701
Yeah, I know what you mean.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.954
I had to do the same thing
when you popped out of a cave.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.623
I was headed to Quantico.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.834
The FBI, the federal police.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.547
Most of us oppose
a national police force.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.965
Yeah?
Well, the point is

14:41.090 --> 14:42.383
I thought I was
heading to bigger things

14:42.466 --> 14:44.051
than Sleepy Hollow
and it turns out

14:44.176 --> 14:45.761
Sleepy Hollow was
where the action is.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.137
Ms. Mills...

14:47.221 --> 14:48.305
Wait!

14:49.431 --> 14:51.725
I cannot promise
Mr. Franklin's response.

14:53.102 --> 14:55.980
But if he does
not receive us well,
they shall lock us both up.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.482
Ichabod.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.650
What do you want?

15:02.278 --> 15:03.279
<i>Bonjour.</i>

15:05.948 --> 15:07.408
But what of my other ideas?

15:07.491 --> 15:08.867
Did libraries catch on?

15:08.951 --> 15:10.911
- One in every neighborhood.
- Splendid! Splendid.

15:10.995 --> 15:12.246
Universities?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.665
Hospitals? The post office?

15:14.748 --> 15:15.916
The Franklin stove?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.543
Bifocals? Swim fins?

15:18.168 --> 15:19.587
All still around.

15:19.837 --> 15:20.963
You're even on the $100 bill.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.298
Uh-hmm.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.675
A hundred.
How about that, Ichabod?

15:25.009 --> 15:26.176
A hundred-dollar bill.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.262
What is Jefferson on?

15:29.013 --> 15:30.681
Two-dollar bill.
The two?

15:30.848 --> 15:33.601
The two...
Does anyone even use the two?
Sounds cumbersome.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.519
I think that's
quite enough, thank you.

15:35.603 --> 15:36.854
No, it is not.

15:37.021 --> 15:38.188
We're standing in
front of a woman

15:38.314 --> 15:39.440
who's two centuries
ahead of us.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.192
Brilliant.
Educated. Well-spoken.

15:42.401 --> 15:43.527
What is your profession?

15:43.736 --> 15:44.987
A sheriff's detective.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.614
An officer of the law.

15:47.031 --> 15:49.783
Ichabod, everything
we're striving for here,

15:50.326 --> 15:53.037
fighting with our dying breath
to create for this country

15:53.120 --> 15:56.457
a free land of opportunity
for all Ms. Abigail Mills
represents.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.584
She is the American dream.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.378
Am I to assume you
believe all this?

16:02.880 --> 16:03.881
When I was in England,

16:03.964 --> 16:06.508
I heard rumors about
the powers of
the <i>Grand Grimoire.</i>

16:07.509 --> 16:11.805
Even evil feared
the repercussions
of time travel

16:11.889 --> 16:12.890
and dared not attempt it.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.477
Ms. Mills claims
a woman is here to kill me,

16:17.019 --> 16:19.772
and that our fates
are entwined with that
of the entire war.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.190
Who is this woman?

16:24.234 --> 16:25.235
A witch, actually.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.362
Oh, she's a witch now.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.197
You left that bit
out when you told me.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.825
Ichabod, fetch my Almanack.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.869
It's in the study on
the third floor. Please.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.537
Go. Now.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.043
Oh.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.461
I know what this is.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.508
And it works. Thank you.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.884
We don't have much time.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.344
This witch...

16:50.427 --> 16:52.429
I noticed you avoided
disclosing her name.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.307
Do you know her?
It's Katrina.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.560
Katrina Crane?
Mmm-hmm.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.229
We tried reasoning with her,

17:00.312 --> 17:02.815
but she was so
crazed with grief
after her son died...

17:02.940 --> 17:04.942
The <i>Grand Grimoire</i>
cannot heal her guilt.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.695
It can only cause
more destruction.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.488
This complicates things.

17:10.447 --> 17:11.573
So do we get
the <i>Grimoire</i> from her?

17:11.699 --> 17:12.825
No.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.411
Forget Katrina,
forget the Horseman.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.329
We must reverse
the Traveler Spell,

17:17.413 --> 17:19.331
which, essentially,
will undo everything
that's happened

17:19.415 --> 17:21.041
since you and Katrina arrived.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.543
As if none of
this ever existed.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.211
So I'd go back to
my natural timeline?

17:25.003 --> 17:26.130
How?

17:26.255 --> 17:27.297
Specifics elude my grasp,

17:27.381 --> 17:30.342
but it's my understanding,
for a brief period,

17:30.426 --> 17:31.719
all spells can be undone.

17:32.845 --> 17:33.971
But time is short.

17:34.930 --> 17:35.973
Where to?

17:36.140 --> 17:38.684
To consult with
a more informed
mind on the subject.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.394
To Fredericks Manor.
Fredericks Manor?

17:40.477 --> 17:41.895
Yes, to Mrs. Grace Dixon.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.856
She's my ancestor.
Huh.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.150
Prepare to meet
her in the flesh.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.779
Mr. Franklin,

17:50.863 --> 17:52.281
I intend to tell
Crane about Katrina.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.741
No.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.160
In the future, we've learned
that it works better

17:56.243 --> 17:57.286
when we're honest
with each other.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.454
But this is the past.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.456
Of all the impossibilities
we discussed,

18:00.539 --> 18:02.750
this is the one he's
least ready to accept.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.835
Trust me, I've been
grooming him for years.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.503
How many people know
about this secret war?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.172
There are levels.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.550
I'm surprised you
haven't encountered
others in your era.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.011
Really...

18:14.178 --> 18:15.304
Tonight we have
but one mission.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.764
To return to Fredericks Manor

18:17.222 --> 18:19.183
and put the world back
the way it was meant to be.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.688
Ichabod. Ready the horses.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.106
We're going to
Fredericks Manor.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.442
Oh, good. You made a plan.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.445
We figured it out.
My ancestor, Grace Dixon,

18:31.528 --> 18:32.654
would know how to
reverse the spell.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.365
That makes perfect sense.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.668
Everybody down!

18:52.674 --> 18:54.134
Abigail! Get the guns!

19:20.869 --> 19:21.912
Ben.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.163
Crane.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.192
Crane!

19:54.695 --> 19:57.447
Fire!
Fire at the Franklin home!

20:02.536 --> 20:03.537
Hurry! Hurry!

20:03.620 --> 20:04.621
Hurry!

20:04.913 --> 20:06.582
Crane.
We have to go. Now.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.511
Do you have
the slightest idea of

20:19.636 --> 20:20.888
the damage we've
caused this nation?

20:20.971 --> 20:23.473
Yes.
Because I know the future.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.394
We have to get back
to Fredericks Manor
and reverse it.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.645
You heard what Franklin said.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.063
Franklin is dead.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.526
The most influential
man in the war effort
is dead, thanks to me.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.738
Our union with
France is in jeopardy,

20:37.821 --> 20:41.325
the rules he was authoring
to govern this land
remain unfinished.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.993
And you schemed,

20:44.036 --> 20:45.996
you played upon my
friendship with Franklin,

20:46.079 --> 20:48.206
upon his predilection
for the supernatural,

20:48.290 --> 20:51.793
and you led a Hessian assassin
to his very doorstep.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.004
He wasn't after Franklin.

20:55.172 --> 20:56.715
He was after us.
Nonsense!

20:56.798 --> 21:00.510
You have to believe
you are that
crucial to this war.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.805
The Horseman is pursuing us

21:03.889 --> 21:06.850
because you and I are
the only ones
who can fix this.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.393
We are partners.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.187
We're partners?
Mmm-hmm.

21:10.354 --> 21:13.065
You talk about
this partnership
and about this bond

21:13.148 --> 21:17.027
and yet you keep from
me vital information
of the very thing you claim.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.488
We're partners?

21:19.696 --> 21:21.949
Then tell me
what you discussed
with Franklin in private.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.204
If I were lying to you,

21:28.956 --> 21:30.374
I wouldn't say
what I'm about to say.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.128
But since the fate of
the world depends
on you believing me...

21:39.383 --> 21:41.593
The Horseman's ally,
the witch...

21:42.844 --> 21:43.971
Is your wife Katrina.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.522
May God have
mercy on your soul.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.566
Crane, wait.
She's pregnant with your son.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.236
You'll see for yourself.

22:01.530 --> 22:04.157
That's it.
Hey, Crane, look at
my cell phone.

22:04.241 --> 22:07.160
It's the black
rectangular thing that
they confiscated from me.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.663
The password is
your birthday.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.791
Look into the photos
for our selfie. Crane!

22:13.750 --> 22:15.669
Captain, listen! Crane!

22:16.670 --> 22:17.838
Crane!

22:27.723 --> 22:29.016
Colonel.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.976
I do not understand.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.442
You had a direct order
to transport her
to the encampment.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.694
I was acting under
promising information
that she gave.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.363
And you took her to
Benjamin Franklin.

22:43.447 --> 22:44.448
She knew intimate details...

22:44.531 --> 22:46.283
Between our
losses this morning

22:46.450 --> 22:48.243
and the loss of
our key diplomat,

22:48.368 --> 22:50.787
this may be
the most tragic day
in the course of the war.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.789
Is she secured?
Yes, sir.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.460
However, I do not
believe she is a spy.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.129
Her rantings are lunacy.
She needs care.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.839
Go home.
Sir...

23:02.299 --> 23:03.300
The 12th Regiment...

23:03.425 --> 23:04.426
You have been
relieved of duty.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.846
Permission to speak...
You are lucky

23:07.929 --> 23:09.639
I do not hang you for treason.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.060
I understand
Washington himself
will send for you.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.228
Dismissed.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.367
Katrina?

23:43.465 --> 23:44.674
What are you doing here?

23:46.551 --> 23:47.844
Katrina.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.679
You startled me.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.851
You surprised me, my darling.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.187
Why are you not with your men?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.523
I've had a wretched day.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.651
I was drawn from
battle by a madwoman.

24:02.734 --> 24:03.860
A madwoman?

24:04.569 --> 24:05.862
And where is she now?

24:06.029 --> 24:08.782
I suspect she'll be
sent to an asylum.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.867
Or hanged.

24:14.871 --> 24:15.997
Rosemary.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.042
Sage

24:20.210 --> 24:21.211
and sweet wine.

24:22.045 --> 24:25.048
I've seen you
prepare this for patients
who are bearing children.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.926
My love, are you...

24:28.009 --> 24:29.052
With child?

24:29.678 --> 24:32.055
Ichabod, this tincture
is for Liza Putnam next door.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.099
She is due any day now.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.643
I hope that does
not disappoint you.

24:38.979 --> 24:42.816
Still, how might I find
this poor madwoman?

24:43.692 --> 24:45.610
As a nurse,
I may be of service to her.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.074
Captain Crane.

24:54.703 --> 24:57.539
Captain,
General Washington requests
your immediate presence.

24:58.915 --> 24:59.916
Very good.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.084
Thank you.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.335
Might I have
a moment before you depart?

25:02.419 --> 25:04.087
The general
was quite insistent.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.466
I will return.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.768
Ride ahead of me.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.604
There's someone
I must visit first.

25:29.779 --> 25:33.533
Ho, there.
The woman's personal effects.
Where are they?

25:37.454 --> 25:38.580
Keep what you fancy.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.207
Has Sutton transferred her?

25:40.290 --> 25:43.126
Not yet.
He was planning to
pay her a visit though.

26:02.979 --> 26:03.980
Huh.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.162
God's wounds.

27:06.293 --> 27:09.087
The password is my birthday.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.801
What devilry is this?

27:55.592 --> 27:56.760
<i>I fail to understand why you</i>

27:56.885 --> 27:58.011
<i>can't simply</i>
<i>take this picture.</i>

27:58.094 --> 27:59.429
<i>'Cause then it</i>
<i>wouldn't be a selfie.</i>

27:59.554 --> 28:00.847
<i>Selfie?</i>

28:01.639 --> 28:04.976
<i>The narcissism</i>
<i>of your generation</i>
<i>never ceases to astound.</i>

28:11.316 --> 28:12.317
Ms. Mills.

28:14.319 --> 28:17.655
<i>As if posterity requires</i>
<i>me to document that</i>
<i>this morning I...</i>

28:17.739 --> 28:19.616
<i>Ate a plate of waffles.</i>

28:19.949 --> 28:21.451
<i>And how long did people back</i>

28:21.576 --> 28:23.078
<i>in your day sit</i>
<i>for an oil painting?</i>

28:23.161 --> 28:24.996
<i>I assure you,</i>
<i>we were not eating waffles.</i>

28:25.955 --> 28:27.415
<i>We were forging a nation.</i>

28:27.832 --> 28:29.000
Everything she said...

28:29.125 --> 28:31.127
<i>Well,</i>
<i>what the 21st century lacks</i>

28:31.252 --> 28:33.171
<i>in vision we make</i>
<i>up for in lack of...</i>

28:35.673 --> 28:38.343
One of the greatest minds
in the colonies has died,

28:38.426 --> 28:40.178
and you are going
to answer for it.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.972
Colonel, I'm on your side.
I've got information for you.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.475
Of the same sort you had
for Captain Crane?

28:45.558 --> 28:46.684
There have been
a lot of developments

28:46.768 --> 28:47.769
in close quarter combat.

28:47.852 --> 28:48.853
Are you threatening me?

28:49.896 --> 28:53.650
Save your breath for
after you have tasted
America's true strength.

29:09.124 --> 29:10.458
Now, that's true
American strength.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.463
Ha!

29:16.840 --> 29:17.966
I'm here to save you.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.469
Though it appears Sutton
is in greater need.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.888
Better late than never.
What made you come back?

29:23.972 --> 29:26.516
I viewed a moving picture

29:26.599 --> 29:29.310
in which you and I attempted
to create a still picture.

29:29.394 --> 29:31.187
The selfie.
Yes. As you said.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.731
Everything you said is true.

29:34.774 --> 29:35.859
We're partners.

29:36.526 --> 29:37.735
More than that. We're friends.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.363
That's a relief.

29:41.865 --> 29:42.866
Thank you.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.409
There's a system of tunnels
beneath the town.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.162
I know.
It gets us halfway
to Fredericks Manor.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.209
I didn't want to believe you.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.047
Then I went home to Katrina.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.676
She must be with child.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.388
I'm sure this is
all incredibly hard.

30:05.472 --> 30:06.806
I saw a book.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.600
It resembles your description
of the <i>Grimoire.</i>

30:08.683 --> 30:09.893
And I thought...

30:10.810 --> 30:13.229
She could be a witch.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.357
Something was amiss.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.068
I had to leave before...

30:20.195 --> 30:21.362
I don't know.

30:22.697 --> 30:25.158
Of all the things you told me,
and there are so many,

30:25.241 --> 30:26.534
my wife wanting me dead...

30:26.618 --> 30:27.869
Crane.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.872
Captain.

30:31.956 --> 30:35.168
It took a long time for
you to understand
her in the future,

30:35.251 --> 30:36.586
if either of us fully do.

30:37.295 --> 30:38.796
What you need to know

30:38.880 --> 30:41.049
is the Katrina
that is here now,

30:41.132 --> 30:43.259
the Katrina that
traveled back in time,

30:43.426 --> 30:45.553
is not the same
woman that you know.

30:47.514 --> 30:49.933
There was a time
she was good
and she loved you.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.434
She saved my life.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.062
Yours, too.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.231
That Katrina's gone.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.275
The seeds must
have been there.

31:01.402 --> 31:02.737
How did I not see it?

31:04.531 --> 31:07.116
We're all blind to what we do
and don't want to believe.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.911
Is that why you chased
Katrina back in time?

31:10.787 --> 31:13.790
You knew I'd not
survive without you?

31:13.873 --> 31:14.916
To be fair,

31:14.999 --> 31:16.543
I didn't have
time to think about

31:16.668 --> 31:18.253
whether it was
a one-way ticket.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.384
Fredericks Manor.

31:24.968 --> 31:29.264
Now, if Grace can
undo this Traveler Spell,

31:30.640 --> 31:32.267
perhaps we can
set things right.

31:34.227 --> 31:35.603
Whatever right is now.

31:44.821 --> 31:45.947
Thank you.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.365
It's much better.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.866
Tell me more about this spy.

31:50.535 --> 31:51.744
She ambushed me.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.788
Then escaped.

31:55.498 --> 31:56.791
Do not worry.

31:56.874 --> 31:59.627
When she scratched you,
she left a little bit
of her blood behind.

31:59.794 --> 32:00.837
Is this necessary?

32:01.504 --> 32:03.339
It is,
in order for me to find her.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.179
She's headed to
Fredericks Manor.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.515
How are you privy
to such information?

32:13.891 --> 32:15.351
Why, it's simple, really.

32:16.311 --> 32:17.395
I'm a witch.

32:27.864 --> 32:29.198
Ah! Captain Crane.

32:29.282 --> 32:31.075
Mrs. Dixon.
Forgive the intrusion.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.454
Grace.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.791
May we...
Come in.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.716
It's really you.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.220
Sorry. Um...

32:52.055 --> 32:54.724
I just always
dreamt of this moment.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.477
I just never thought
I would actually be here.

32:58.394 --> 32:59.562
Have we met?

32:59.854 --> 33:00.980
Sort of.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.233
I meant...

33:04.942 --> 33:05.943
How do I say this?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.570
Um...

33:07.987 --> 33:09.072
Your spirit.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.241
My name is Abigail Mills.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.369
Actually...

33:14.661 --> 33:16.954
Grace Abigail Mills.

33:18.498 --> 33:19.666
We're related.

33:21.376 --> 33:22.877
Yeah.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.756
Only a couple of
centuries apart.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.597
Oh, my Lord.

33:36.349 --> 33:39.894
It's you. The Witness!

33:40.603 --> 33:42.647
I'm sorry. "Witness"?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.440
That's the technical term
for us.

33:45.358 --> 33:46.484
Of course it is.

33:46.567 --> 33:47.777
How are you here?

33:48.319 --> 33:51.030
Abigail,
I have so many questions.

33:51.114 --> 33:54.283
So do I.
And God do I wish
we had more time.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.244
But we don't.

33:56.327 --> 33:59.831
Suffice it to say,
she is from the future.

34:01.124 --> 34:04.293
She followed
a blood magic practitioner
to our time.

34:04.377 --> 34:05.920
Benjamin Franklin said

34:06.129 --> 34:09.090
that you would know how
to reverse the Traveler Spell.

34:11.467 --> 34:16.305
The Abiero spell
will return you

34:17.014 --> 34:18.850
to the moment
the spell was cast.

34:18.933 --> 34:22.103
But it will require
a great deal of power.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.646
I will have to
draw on the energies

34:23.813 --> 34:25.273
that normally
shield this house.

34:25.356 --> 34:26.399
So, we'll be
vulnerable to attack?

34:26.524 --> 34:27.525
Yeah.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.360
Then we should commence.

34:31.821 --> 34:32.989
We found your journal.

34:33.698 --> 34:37.493
My mom, my sister.
It's guided us,
helped us fight evil.

34:38.327 --> 34:40.913
Everything that
we do is because of
the legacy that you started.

34:40.997 --> 34:45.001
Well, I knew what transpired
in this house was important.

34:45.084 --> 34:48.171
But was impossible to know
if it would be remembered,

34:48.254 --> 34:51.591
saved or wind up
in the proper hands.

34:53.176 --> 34:56.679
Sometimes all it takes is
to put pen to paper
to make a difference.

35:13.863 --> 35:15.656
It's the Horseman and Katrina.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.575
The hex guarding the house
won't hold long.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.535
- I'll delay them.
- Crane?

35:20.036 --> 35:21.162
You will die out there.

35:21.579 --> 35:23.039
If you succeed,
it won't matter.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.124
And if you do not,

35:25.208 --> 35:27.043
there will be greater problems
than my death.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.336
- I'll go with you.
- No!

35:28.419 --> 35:30.546
For the spell to work,
you must stay with me.

35:30.630 --> 35:31.798
Listen to me.

35:32.715 --> 35:36.719
No matter what the course
of fate and no matter
how I get there,

35:37.053 --> 35:39.096
I look forward to
experiencing your America.

35:40.014 --> 35:41.724
It will be
a pleasure to make your

35:41.891 --> 35:43.559
acquaintance all
over again, Ms. Mills.

35:46.562 --> 35:47.647
Yes?

35:47.730 --> 35:51.776
It's just that you
don't speak to me
so formally in the future.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.361
And what would you prefer?

35:54.195 --> 35:55.446
Lieutenant.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.406
Well, Lieutenant...

35:58.491 --> 36:01.619
Let us change
the course of history again.

36:10.545 --> 36:13.965
Is this level of intimacy
commonplace in 2015?

36:14.841 --> 36:15.925
Yeah.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.261
We hug it out.

36:23.266 --> 36:24.308
Ah!

36:24.392 --> 36:25.601
Before we part, please!

36:27.270 --> 36:29.146
Look at the end of my journal.

36:30.857 --> 36:32.275
Yeah, I've seen these pages.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.026
They're empty.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.779
Abigail, these are the most
important pages of all.

36:37.572 --> 36:39.198
These are the pages
you will write.

36:40.074 --> 36:42.577
The most crucial
battles still lie ahead.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.590
The wards are down.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.216
Go!

37:21.699 --> 37:22.992
He's not gonna make it!

37:23.993 --> 37:25.161
There's no time!

37:30.291 --> 37:33.002
Read these words to
complete the spell.

38:08.371 --> 38:10.164
No! No! No!

38:10.665 --> 38:12.166
You cannot stop this!

38:40.987 --> 38:42.571
No.
Thank you, Grace.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.074
No! I was making
things right.

38:46.075 --> 38:47.243
You brought us back here.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.078
This is your doing!

38:59.547 --> 39:00.965
Katrina, no!

39:01.048 --> 39:02.550
She killed my son.

39:04.468 --> 39:05.678
She dies.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.677
Jeremy.

39:54.018 --> 39:55.144
Jeremy.

41:01.794 --> 41:03.212
You had no choice.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.388
Yes, I did.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.393
We all did.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.918
No, no! No! It's okay!

41:43.252 --> 41:44.336
Abbie?

41:44.461 --> 41:45.588
Don't shoot.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.090
I don't want to die again.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.258
Is it really you?

41:49.633 --> 41:51.093
Henry's death
released my soul.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.944
Katrina?

42:13.324 --> 42:14.617
I'm sorry.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.371
So, it's over.

42:19.997 --> 42:21.165
This part is over.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.628
But Grace told me that
this war is not over.

42:25.711 --> 42:26.712
Grace?

42:27.796 --> 42:28.881
I wish you were there.

42:31.133 --> 42:34.011
She told me that
the most crucial battles
are still ahead of us.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.139
This is why we're here.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.642
All of us together.

42:41.644 --> 42:44.146
Whatever's next,
we're there for each other.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.086
You ready, Captain?

43:13.050 --> 43:14.051
Ready, Lieutenant.
