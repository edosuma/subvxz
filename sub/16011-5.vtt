01:57.080 --> 01:58.800
Funny Mia,

01:58.840 --> 02:01.120
we were just talking about you!

02:01.160 --> 02:02.880
And your book.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.600
Fascinating. Have fun!

02:04.640 --> 02:05.896
I'll be over there having lunch.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.480
What do elves eat for lunch?

02:08.440 --> 02:10.080
Yeah! Elf food?

02:15.840 --> 02:17.760
I make the witty remarks, Paula.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.600
Oh... you mean

02:20.601 --> 02:21.960
I'm not allowed to talk?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.160
You'll get used to it.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.960
Look at how she holds it.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.160
You'd think that book

02:30.161 --> 02:31.320
was made of gold.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.840
Maybe it is!

02:33.880 --> 02:35.520
No. But I must have missed

02:35.521 --> 02:37.160
something last time.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.120
I want that book again.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.300
Whoever gets it for me

02:41.301 --> 02:42.440
will be rewarded.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.160
With what?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.400
My appreciation.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.040
What more do you need?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.560
I'll keep her distracted,

02:53.561 --> 02:54.680
you get the book.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.600
[Vincent] Oh no!

02:58.640 --> 03:00.760
Juice is so hard to get out!

03:00.800 --> 03:02.440
This is ruined!

03:02.480 --> 03:03.580
Now I only have twelve

03:03.581 --> 03:04.680
of these, you klutz!

03:07.880 --> 03:08.960
[giggles]

03:10.560 --> 03:12.160
Thanks for that.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.960
- I thought
- I'd have to tunnel my way out.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.440
Hey, what are friends for?

03:15.480 --> 03:16.696
You know, aside from translating

03:16.720 --> 03:19.280
magical elvish runes and stuff.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.760
Speaking of which...

03:20.800 --> 03:21.960
Nothing yet.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.400
I've been watching.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.480
So... what happens

03:25.520 --> 03:26.560
after you've translated

03:26.561 --> 03:27.600
all the runes?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.600
Something really magical happen?

03:29.640 --> 03:32.200
- It seems like the book is all
- everyone's interested in today.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.040
They're directions

03:39.041 --> 03:40.240
to buried treasure?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.520
Nope.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.240
A recipe for some elf potion?

03:43.280 --> 03:44.380
- No.

03:44.381 --> 03:45.480
- Elvish poetry?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.700
I bet elves

03:46.701 --> 03:47.880
write great limericks.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.800
No.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.040
Um... Plans to build something?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.000
No.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.520
- Directions to buried treasure?
- You already said that one.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.240
- That's what I really
- want it to be.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.120
Look, can we change the subject?

04:00.880 --> 04:01.920
Okay.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.080
- Would it still
- be the same subject

04:05.120 --> 04:06.800
- If I told you
- your bracelet was lit up?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.160
Garden house!

04:29.600 --> 04:31.360
Wow. I don't see the novelty

04:31.361 --> 04:33.120
of that ever wearing off.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.040
That's "wind".

04:36.080 --> 04:38.320
And that's "water".

04:38.360 --> 04:40.520
That's "Golden Horn".

04:41.760 --> 04:43.960
But I don't know what that is.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.960
[Vincent] I dunno...

04:46.000 --> 04:47.840
- looks kind of different
- to the others.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.160
I mean...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.200
maybe it's a name or something.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.960
Yeah! Check out the big brain

04:54.961 --> 04:56.680
on Vincent.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.520
What can I say? I'm a nerd.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.000
Okay. Got it.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.240
Do you mind?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.800
You still want me to leave?!

05:12.840 --> 05:14.680
- What do you do
- for those few minutes?

05:14.720 --> 05:15.920
I'm just...

05:15.960 --> 05:17.520
it's private, okay?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.200
Fine, that's how it is.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.120
I tell you everything,

05:23.160 --> 05:25.320
you don't tell me anything.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.120
I'll never understand girls.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.880
[door closes]

05:36.200 --> 05:37.640
Hi Mia.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.920
Say your password.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.680
"Wind and water, Golden Horn,

05:41.720 --> 05:44.200
through Onchao...

05:44.240 --> 05:45.960
new hope is born."

05:57.360 --> 05:59.280
[screams]

06:03.600 --> 06:05.240
Aim for something soft...

06:05.241 --> 06:06.880
aim for something... AH!

06:06.920 --> 06:08.280
Soft.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.000
- [Yuko] You're getting better...
- sort of.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.240
Thanks.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.200
And hi! You're here!

06:22.480 --> 06:23.720
Umm...

06:23.760 --> 06:26.200
Yuko, what's going on?

06:26.240 --> 06:28.320
You better see for yourself...

06:30.160 --> 06:32.040
[Mia] Lyria! What's wrong?

06:32.080 --> 06:33.220
We're not sure. We haven't

06:33.221 --> 06:34.360
seen her since the day

06:34.400 --> 06:36.040
Panthea destroyed the Trumptus.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
Then today she just showed up...

06:37.520 --> 06:38.800
[snorts]

06:38.840 --> 06:40.480
- Really?!
- Is she okay?

06:40.520 --> 06:42.000
Yes and no.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.800
Lyria's going to have a baby!

06:43.840 --> 06:45.120
[gasps] She's having

06:45.121 --> 06:46.400
a baby unicorn?!

06:46.440 --> 06:48.520
I don't believe it!

06:48.560 --> 06:49.780
Why aren't you as happy

06:49.781 --> 06:51.000
as we are?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.060
Because she's going

06:52.061 --> 06:53.080
to have her baby...

06:53.120 --> 06:54.140
- now!!

06:54.141 --> 06:55.160
- Uuuughh...

06:55.200 --> 06:56.560
Shouldn't we do something?

06:56.561 --> 06:57.920
We have to do something.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.140
Should I boil some water?

06:59.141 --> 07:00.320
Grab some blankets!

07:00.360 --> 07:01.976
- Anyone know
- how to build a unicorn nest?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.100
You need to take

07:03.101 --> 07:04.200
some deep breaths.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.520
[pants]

07:07.560 --> 07:09.200
How is this helping Lyria?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.360
It's not.

07:10.361 --> 07:11.480
But it sure helps us.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.160
[neighs]

07:13.200 --> 07:15.480
- She keeps saying
- she needs to get to the water.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.820
That's right!

07:16.821 --> 07:18.120
All unicorns are born

07:18.160 --> 07:19.760
- in the waters
- of the Birth Grotto!

07:19.800 --> 07:22.160
- But no elf
- has ever been able to find it!

07:22.200 --> 07:23.400
[neighs]

07:23.440 --> 07:24.840
The unicorns will lead the way.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.440
It's part of their ritual.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.440
- Stand back.
- They won't come near

07:28.480 --> 07:29.560
While we're around.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.840
Come on!

07:54.800 --> 07:55.840
[snorts]

07:56.560 --> 07:57.600
[gasps]

08:12.160 --> 08:14.360
[Mia] (GASPS) Lyria!!

08:16.680 --> 08:18.120
The oracle said

08:18.160 --> 08:20.760
"Wind and water, golden horn,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.000
through Onchao

08:22.001 --> 08:23.200
new hope is born".

08:23.240 --> 08:26.040
Onchao?! What's an Onchao?

08:26.080 --> 08:27.640
I have no idea.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.560
- But this might be
- a sort of a grotto.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.320
- [snorts]
- This isn't it?

08:31.360 --> 08:32.860
- [neighs]

08:32.861 --> 08:34.360
- Ohh...

08:34.400 --> 08:36.159
- she says the Birth Grotto
- is in the cave

08:36.200 --> 08:37.600
Of the "Water Unicorn".

08:37.640 --> 08:39.640
[gasps] The Water Unicorn?

08:39.679 --> 08:41.120
That's where the grotto is?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.919
Okay, everybody stop gasping

08:42.960 --> 08:44.480
and tell me what that is.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.840
The Water Unicorn

08:45.841 --> 08:47.160
is very powerful.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.280
Guardian of all the waters

08:48.281 --> 08:49.360
of Centopia.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.360
- No elf has ever seen her
- up close.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.540
And she has powers

08:52.541 --> 08:53.680
we can't imagine.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.920
Well we better imagine them,

08:54.960 --> 08:56.560
because Lyria needs her!

08:56.600 --> 08:57.720
[neighs]

08:57.760 --> 08:59.720
- That way!
- Mmm...

09:02.840 --> 09:05.480
[gasps] Panthea's Palace!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.320
[Mo] And there's some Muncs!

09:08.360 --> 09:09.680
Quick, hide!

09:09.720 --> 09:11.600
I'll take care of Lyria!

09:14.080 --> 09:16.360
It's okay! Everybody stay calm!

09:20.200 --> 09:21.240
[dragons shriek]

09:22.720 --> 09:23.920
That was close!

09:23.960 --> 09:25.600
I don't think they saw us.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.280
[neighs slightly]

09:27.320 --> 09:28.560
She's too weak to move.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.040
Well she can't stay here!

09:30.080 --> 09:31.960
- Maybe the Water Unicorn
- can help us.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.280
The Water Unicorn won't let us

09:33.281 --> 09:34.560
get anywhere near her.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.360
- Neither do any
- of the other unicorns.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.800
But they listen to me, right?

09:37.840 --> 09:39.680
You have to let me try!

09:42.480 --> 09:43.680
Yuko, find a safe place

09:43.681 --> 09:44.880
to hide Lyria

09:44.920 --> 09:46.160
and the other unicorns.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.520
You and the elves stand guard

09:47.560 --> 09:48.840
till we get back.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.720
Mia, we have to move fast.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.640
I sure hope we weren't spotted.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.080
POOF!

10:01.360 --> 10:03.480
I do wish you annoying muncs

10:03.520 --> 10:04.700
would stop getting

10:04.701 --> 10:05.880
yourselves shrunk!

10:05.920 --> 10:07.060
You're leaving stains

10:07.061 --> 10:08.200
on my shoes!

10:13.320 --> 10:15.320
Meow...

10:15.360 --> 10:16.520
Meeoooww!

10:20.680 --> 10:22.480
My queen...

10:22.520 --> 10:24.180
Alright, you can stop

10:24.181 --> 10:25.840
your pathetic kowtowing now.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.720
What is it?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.960
- I suppose you are here
- to tell me about the unicorns

10:30.000 --> 10:31.760
Stupidly coming straight

10:31.761 --> 10:33.520
towards my palace.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.840
You seem surprised that I know.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.640
[explodes in anger] I am Queen!

10:37.641 --> 10:39.400
I know everything.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.020
Also, one of your scouts

10:41.021 --> 10:42.600
told me a few minutes ago.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.200
Well, they seem to have stopped.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.720
So surround them,

10:46.721 --> 10:48.200
close in, and capture them.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.696
- [Gargona] It...
- it's just that, if...

10:49.720 --> 10:51.160
If they're coming this way,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.680
they must have a good reason.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.360
Would it not be wise

10:55.361 --> 10:57.000
to find out what it is?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.280
I don't want to be "wise"!

10:59.320 --> 11:01.560
[cries] I want to be young!

11:02.960 --> 11:05.040
So quit skulking around here

11:05.080 --> 11:07.400
and go get me unicorn horns!

11:07.440 --> 11:08.680
Yes Ma'am...

11:08.720 --> 11:09.880
Absolutely Ma'am.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.960
[grunts, frustrated]

11:14.600 --> 11:16.120
Ugghh...

11:16.160 --> 11:18.040
- I told you to let me know
- in advance

11:18.080 --> 11:19.420
When your shrunkenness

11:19.421 --> 11:20.760
is wearing off!

11:20.800 --> 11:22.080
Fool!

11:36.480 --> 11:38.560
This could be it.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.440
[echoed] Hellooooo...

11:40.480 --> 11:43.040
Anybody home?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.120
It doesn't look like

11:44.121 --> 11:45.160
a sacred grotto.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.800
How many have you ever seen?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.220
None. I just imagined

11:48.221 --> 11:49.600
something more...

11:49.640 --> 11:51.320
sacred-grotto-y.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.720
[Mia] Wow!

11:54.760 --> 11:56.680
I was just going to say that.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.360
Look at this!

12:03.400 --> 12:05.480
The four Elemental Unicorns.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.640
Each one is a legendary,

12:06.641 --> 12:07.760
powerful guardian

12:07.800 --> 12:09.240
over a part of this world:

12:09.280 --> 12:12.920
Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.960
[gasps]

12:15.960 --> 12:17.360
Did you see that?!

12:17.400 --> 12:18.640
You're seeing things.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.200
I'm telling you, it was there.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.980
Water Unicorn,

12:22.981 --> 12:24.720
we need to talk to you!

12:24.760 --> 12:25.960
I'm a friend

12:25.961 --> 12:27.160
of the unicorn Lyria.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.760
She's going to have a baby!

12:36.040 --> 12:37.960
[whinnies loudly]

12:39.680 --> 12:41.600
- Whoa.
- She says is vital

12:41.640 --> 12:42.696
That we bring Lyria here...

12:42.720 --> 12:44.120
[shrieks]

12:44.160 --> 12:46.160
[Mia] She says if we don't,

12:46.200 --> 12:47.480
it could be disastrous

12:47.481 --> 12:48.760
for the baby, for Lyria...

12:48.800 --> 12:50.440
and for Centopia.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.120
She said all that?

12:52.160 --> 12:53.720
We're afraid to move her.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.240
Is there any way you could help?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.960
[shrieks]

12:59.400 --> 13:01.120
[Mia] Look outside?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.320
Wait!!!

13:08.480 --> 13:09.640
[Mo] The Water Unicorn

13:09.641 --> 13:10.800
must be doing that!

13:10.840 --> 13:12.100
- That must be a signal!

13:12.101 --> 13:13.360
- A signal to who?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.240
I think we're about to find out.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.760
It's... The Wind Unicorn.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.240
[wind blows heavily]

13:22.280 --> 13:23.320
Ugh!

13:25.040 --> 13:26.320
[neighs]

13:32.840 --> 13:34.060
[Mia] "Wind and water,

13:34.061 --> 13:35.280
golden horn..."

13:35.320 --> 13:36.776
- I guess now we know
- what that means.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.160
[neighs wildly]

13:40.520 --> 13:42.480
It wants to know where Lyria is.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.400
We'll show you! Follow us!

13:45.440 --> 13:46.520
DING DING!

13:46.560 --> 13:48.160
Take us to Yuko!!

14:01.760 --> 14:03.160
They're on their way.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.120
What's that?

14:10.160 --> 14:12.760
Rooound up the unicorns!

14:12.800 --> 14:14.320
There are enough down there

14:14.360 --> 14:15.720
to keep Panthea happy

14:15.721 --> 14:17.080
for a year!

14:17.120 --> 14:19.160
Ha!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.840
- Munc attack!!
- We're outnumbered!

14:20.880 --> 14:22.060
- We should retreat!

14:22.061 --> 14:23.240
- [neighing]

14:23.280 --> 14:25.600
[Yuko] Noo! Lyria can't move!

14:25.640 --> 14:27.320
Mo better get here soon!

14:27.360 --> 14:29.080
Elves, protect Lyria!!

14:29.880 --> 14:31.200
[grunts]

14:36.000 --> 14:37.040
Wooa!

14:37.880 --> 14:39.160
[neighing]

14:40.480 --> 14:41.520
Yaa!

14:41.560 --> 14:47.160
Hah!

14:47.200 --> 14:49.200
Ugh! Ugh!

14:49.240 --> 14:50.600
[dragon shrieking]

14:50.640 --> 14:51.680
[gasps]

14:53.840 --> 14:56.080
[laughs maniacally]

14:58.720 --> 15:00.440
[gasps]

15:00.480 --> 15:02.380
- Ugh!

15:02.381 --> 15:04.280
- [Gargona] Haha!

15:04.320 --> 15:06.040
[grunting]

15:06.080 --> 15:08.440
No! Oh!

15:08.480 --> 15:10.680
[growls wildly]

15:10.720 --> 15:11.760
- Haha!

15:11.761 --> 15:12.800
- [neighing]

15:20.400 --> 15:23.440
What kind of unicorn is that?!

15:23.480 --> 15:25.760
That's... amazing!

15:27.680 --> 15:29.100
Weren't you supposed to find

15:29.101 --> 15:30.520
the Water Unicorn for Lyria?

15:30.560 --> 15:31.600
We did! And she sent us

15:31.601 --> 15:32.640
The Wind Unicorn

15:32.680 --> 15:34.840
to help get Lyria to the Grotto.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.480
Oooommmmmmmmmphhhhhh.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.400
Aggh!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.380
Lyria! We're going to get you

15:56.381 --> 15:57.760
to the Grotto.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.860
- Right?

15:58.861 --> 15:59.920
- [neighs]

16:11.440 --> 16:12.660
C'mon! I don't want

16:12.661 --> 16:13.880
to miss this.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.880
Hey, neither do I.

16:17.920 --> 16:18.960
A little help?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.120
[Mia] Bye.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.560
And thanks for your help!

16:36.600 --> 16:37.920
[neighs]

16:48.080 --> 16:50.280
- [Mia] I can't believe
- it's really going to happen!

16:50.320 --> 16:52.360
Lyria's having a baby!

16:57.680 --> 16:58.920
[neighs]

16:58.960 --> 17:01.400
Don't worry, it will be okay!

17:15.040 --> 17:16.319
What's gonna happen?

17:16.359 --> 17:17.839
Something amazing.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.480
[neighs]

17:43.520 --> 17:45.520
[Mia] Look at his horn!

17:45.560 --> 17:47.400
Have you ever seen a golden one

17:47.401 --> 17:49.240
like that before?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.440
- [Mo] Never.

17:50.441 --> 17:51.600
- [neighs]

17:51.640 --> 17:52.800
[Mia] She says

17:52.801 --> 17:53.960
his name is Onchao.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.800
Just like the oracle.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.240
"Wind and water, golden horn,

17:58.280 --> 18:00.120
- through Onchao
- new hope is born."

18:00.160 --> 18:01.880
I'd say we found it.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.360
[neighs]

18:07.440 --> 18:09.920
[Yuko] (LAUGHS) Wow!

18:09.960 --> 18:11.240
What kind of a unicorn

18:11.241 --> 18:12.520
has wings?!

18:12.560 --> 18:14.020
Water Unicorn,

18:14.021 --> 18:15.480
on behalf of all the elves,

18:15.520 --> 18:16.800
I thank you!

18:17.760 --> 18:19.040
[neighs]

18:40.600 --> 18:41.680
[snorts]

18:51.720 --> 18:53.000
[sniffs]

18:53.040 --> 18:54.920
[sneezes]

18:54.960 --> 18:56.460
Today the Water Unicorn

18:56.461 --> 18:57.960
and the Wind Unicorn

18:58.000 --> 18:59.800
both revealed themselves

18:59.801 --> 19:01.600
for the first time in centuries.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.800
For him.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.200
[Mia] (GIGGLES) What's he doing?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.280
[neighs]

19:16.320 --> 19:17.560
- [Mo] Are you seeing this?!

19:17.561 --> 19:18.800
- [Yuko] I'm seeing it,

19:18.840 --> 19:20.560
I just don't believe it!

19:21.920 --> 19:23.480
These were dead lands...

19:23.520 --> 19:24.980
- Woohoo!

19:24.981 --> 19:26.440
- destroyed by Panthea.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.960
We can't even bring life

19:27.961 --> 19:29.440
back to them with unicorn dust.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.256
- [Yuko] Do you realize
- what this could mean?

19:31.280 --> 19:32.760
He could bring life back

19:32.761 --> 19:34.240
to the whole island!

19:34.280 --> 19:36.560
I told you he was special!

19:36.600 --> 19:38.120
[Yuko] Wohoo!

19:38.160 --> 19:39.640
[both laugh excitedly]

19:44.920 --> 19:45.960
[snorts]

19:47.280 --> 19:48.400
[sniffs]

19:48.440 --> 19:50.000
He likes me!

19:52.560 --> 19:53.820
We better hope Panthea

19:53.821 --> 19:55.080
never finds out about him.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.720
Because if she does...

19:56.760 --> 19:58.080
He'll never know

19:58.081 --> 19:59.400
a day of peace in his life.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.380
So now that bizarre "Trumptus"

20:10.381 --> 20:12.200
thing is out of the way,

20:12.240 --> 20:13.920
you still fail to bring me

20:13.921 --> 20:15.600
a unicorn because...

20:15.640 --> 20:17.400
it was windy?

20:17.440 --> 20:20.320
Not just windy, my queen!

20:20.360 --> 20:22.320
A wind unicorn!

20:22.360 --> 20:24.040
It made a kind of cyclone

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
and then the wind

20:25.081 --> 20:26.081
was very powerful

20:26.120 --> 20:28.260
and all of my troops

20:28.261 --> 20:30.400
went WHOOSH and...

20:30.440 --> 20:31.880
you don't believe me at all,

20:31.881 --> 20:33.320
do you?

20:33.360 --> 20:34.840
Sometimes I wonder

20:34.841 --> 20:36.320
if you're in your right mind,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.160
- Gargona.
- But my Queen,

20:38.200 --> 20:39.840
If such powerful forces

20:39.841 --> 20:41.480
are at work among the unicorns,

20:41.520 --> 20:43.200
then something important

20:43.201 --> 20:44.880
must be happening!

20:44.920 --> 20:45.940
Don't try to distract me

20:45.941 --> 20:46.960
from the fact

20:47.000 --> 20:48.440
that you have failed me!

20:48.480 --> 20:49.960
Again!

20:58.720 --> 21:00.560
Tell all of Centopia.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.080
This is a great day

21:02.081 --> 21:03.560
for Elves everywhere!

21:04.800 --> 21:06.840
Pretty good for unicorns too!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.600
Even the Pans are happy!

21:12.640 --> 21:14.840
[♪♪♪]

21:23.360 --> 21:24.560
[Mia] Ha ha!

21:24.600 --> 21:25.840
Keep trying, you'll get it!

21:25.880 --> 21:27.160
You're already better than me!

21:27.200 --> 21:28.400
[tinkling]

21:28.440 --> 21:30.520
Nooo! Not now!

21:30.560 --> 21:32.680
This has been the best day ever,

21:32.720 --> 21:34.920
for me and especially, for you.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.960
We're going to have

21:35.961 --> 21:36.961
the biggest party ever!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.480
[Yuko laughs]

21:38.520 --> 21:40.360
- I can't believe
- I'm going to miss it!

21:40.400 --> 21:41.820
Goodbye, you guys!

21:41.821 --> 21:43.240
I'll be back, Onchao!

21:49.560 --> 21:50.960
Low battery again?!

21:51.000 --> 21:52.520
What's up with that?!

21:56.320 --> 21:57.460
You've got a bright future,

21:57.461 --> 21:58.600
little guy.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.400
My dad used to read this to me

22:18.401 --> 22:20.080
every night when I was little.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.120
- It was like a special thing
- we had.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.000
And he made me this...

22:25.040 --> 22:26.920
right before he...

22:26.960 --> 22:28.220
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.480
I didn't mean to pry.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.640
No it's okay. Really.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.480
You like games, right?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.240
I've been known to dabble.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.780
Good. Then you're gonna

22:38.781 --> 22:40.280
love this one.
