00:03.020 --> 00:06.790
Hello, Chyna.
You're looking very lovely today.

00:06.820 --> 00:08.720
You're so sweet.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.830
And handsome.
And charming. And...

00:11.860 --> 00:14.760
Don't speak...

00:19.100 --> 00:20.770
What are you doing?

00:21.840 --> 00:23.740
What are you doing?

00:26.780 --> 00:27.820
Yeah.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.759
Hey, guys, I have big news!

00:32.790 --> 00:34.860
There's a new Ant joining us today.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.960
'is name is Nigel and 'e is from England.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.840
That's my British accent.

00:41.070 --> 00:44.130
It eez spot on, don't you think, governor?

00:46.050 --> 00:48.310
Well, it's better than
your Australian accent.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.120
Good-a day-a, mate.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.050
Throw-a another shrimp-a
on the barbie-a.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.160
So this Nigel, did he just move here?

00:58.200 --> 00:59.330
Not exactly.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.910
<i>'ello, I'm Nigel.</i>
<i>Good to meet you.</i>

01:09.950 --> 01:12.080
Welcome to the Ant Farm.

01:12.120 --> 01:12.980
That's my Swedish accent.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.920
Gibson, you didn't mention

01:18.960 --> 01:21.260
that there was something
unusual about Nigel.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.060
Sure, I did.
I told you he was British.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.160
No, I mean he's a robot.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.160
Chyna!

01:27.200 --> 01:32.170
We do not use labels here in the Ant Farm.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.040
Which is why I occasionally
shmear paste on my bagel.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.440
<i>I'm not a robot.</i>

01:39.480 --> 01:43.080
I'm in England speaking to you
through this tele-presence device,

01:43.120 --> 01:48.190
equipped with gyropscopic wheels, HD
webcam, and an mp3 player for karaoke.

01:54.330 --> 01:57.070
Interestingly enough,

01:57.100 --> 01:59.070
karaoke does not originate from Japan,

01:59.100 --> 02:00.940
but rather from a 196os
American television show.

02:00.970 --> 02:03.170
<i>Sing Along with Mitch.</i>

02:04.940 --> 02:06.170
You two should get along.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.180
You're a human in a robot body

02:08.210 --> 02:10.150
and Olive's a robot in a human body.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.180
Thank you.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.950
Well, you seem very nice.
For a robot.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.090
Because usually in the movies,

02:19.120 --> 02:21.290
you guys rise up and
wipe out the human race.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.230
You're not going to do that, are you?

02:25.260 --> 02:29.070
<i>No, we only do that</i>
<i>once we determine</i>

02:29.100 --> 02:33.970
<i>that humans are</i> <i>useless beings
,</i> <i>worthy of elimination.</i>

02:38.180 --> 02:42.120
It looks like that day may be upon us.

Whoo!

03:40.700 --> 03:42.980
There.
I got the thorn out of your paw,

03:43.020 --> 03:45.120
but now you owe me a favor.

03:48.090 --> 03:51.120
No, I'm not going to kiss it better.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.830
So, Nigel, of your classes yet?

03:55.860 --> 03:56.960
<i>I just took everything</i>
<i>that's on the first floor.</i>

03:57.000 --> 04:01.740
Hmm.
Angus did the same thing.

04:01.770 --> 04:06.010
How am I supposed to get
room four in 10 minutes?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.110
So, what's your talent?

04:12.150 --> 04:13.080
Vacuuming carpets?

04:13.110 --> 04:15.120
<i>I'll show you.</i>

04:17.820 --> 04:21.790
<i>The measure done,</i> <i>I'll
watch her</i> <i>place of stand.</i>

04:21.820 --> 04:24.860
<i>And touching hers,</i> <i>make

04:24.890 --> 04:26.830
<i>Did my heart love till now?</i>

04:27.860 --> 04:30.000
<i>Forswear it, sight!</i>

04:31.200 --> 04:33.930
<i>For I ne'er saw</i> <i>true beauty</i>

04:33.970 --> 04:35.140
<i>till this night.</i>

04:38.140 --> 04:41.010
Wow, you're an amazing actor.

04:41.980 --> 04:42.980
Big deal.

04:43.010 --> 04:43.910
Any robot can do Shakespeare.

04:45.810 --> 04:47.980
You want to impress us,

04:48.020 --> 04:48.880
let's see you transform into a truck.

05:00.860 --> 05:01.890
Show off!

05:09.940 --> 05:12.100
So what's so important that
you had to show me in person?

05:12.140 --> 05:14.100
I was in the middle of a big case.

05:14.140 --> 05:17.740
Of caramel corn.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.880
Check it out.
I got the high score on Donkey King!

05:20.950 --> 05:22.110
You're kidding me!

05:22.150 --> 05:23.980
I used to play this when I was your age!

05:24.020 --> 05:25.120
Really?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.990
Yeah, I was into all the games.

05:27.020 --> 05:32.060
Snac-Man, Froggie,
Space Inf esters.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.760
Check out my initials.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.030
C.O.P.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.130
Yeah, you've got second place.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.030
What?

05:40.070 --> 05:41.970
O.D.D.?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.140
Who's Odd?

05:43.170 --> 05:44.910
I am!

05:45.810 --> 05:48.110
Olive Daphne Doyle.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.940
How'd you get such a high score?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.950
I just memorized all the game patterns.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.050
But there are like
10,000 different patterns.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.950
Yeah, that's why it was so easy.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.790
Do you mind?
I want to play again.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.020
Maybe I'll beat my own high score

06:02.060 --> 06:03.990
and bump you down to third.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.990
Dad, do something!
Arrest her!

06:06.030 --> 06:06.760
For what?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.100
All of a sudden you need a reason?

06:12.170 --> 06:14.070
Okay, Olive.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.810
You think you're so great?

06:16.840 --> 06:17.910
There's a Donkey King
tournament tomorrow night,

06:17.940 --> 06:21.980
and my son is going to take you to school.

06:22.010 --> 06:26.110
Ooh, I'm always looking for a
good carpooling opportunity.

06:36.020 --> 06:36.960
Hey, Fletcher.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.860
Oh. Are you finger painting
a finger painting?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.930
Right.
It's my finger.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.870
It's not like I have a
freakishly long toe or anything.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.140
Okay.

06:51.170 --> 06:54.870
Can I ask you about
something kind of personal?

06:56.080 --> 06:56.880
It's about my feet, isn't it?

06:58.940 --> 06:59.940
No.

06:59.980 --> 07:03.110
There's this guy I'm kind of interested in.

07:03.150 --> 07:07.120
He's cute and sweet and artistic...

07:08.090 --> 07:09.990
Really?

07:11.090 --> 07:11.890
Yeah.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.790
Do you think I should I ask him out

07:14.830 --> 07:16.790
or wait for him to make the first move?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.830
Ask him out!
Ask him out!

07:18.860 --> 07:20.860
So, if it were you,

07:20.900 --> 07:21.730
you don't think it would be too forward?

07:21.770 --> 07:23.900
No! Do it! Do it now!

07:23.940 --> 07:24.900
Okay. Okay.

07:25.870 --> 07:26.840
Hi, Nigel.

07:29.420 --> 07:31.350
Are you busy Friday night?

07:31.370 --> 07:32.540
What?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.490
There he is!

07:45.500 --> 07:47.200
The soon-to-be champ!

07:48.070 --> 07:49.450
Yeah...

07:49.480 --> 07:52.310
I don't know if I'm going to
play Olive in the tournament.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.360
I don't want to crush
that little girl's dreams.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.800
Crush them!
She'll get over it.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.050
It builds character.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.620
You know how many of my dreams were
crushed when you kids were born?

08:01.650 --> 08:02.890
What?

08:02.920 --> 08:06.630
I mean bad dreams were crushed.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.830
Bad dreams like sleeping in on the weekends

08:08.860 --> 08:10.700
and having money in the bank.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.600
What if I can't beat Olive?

08:14.630 --> 08:15.800
You can do this.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.640
All you need is training.

08:17.670 --> 08:18.770
That's how I became a good cop.

08:19.810 --> 08:21.570
Okay!

08:21.610 --> 08:22.810
I'll go down to the arcade
and practice all night!

08:22.840 --> 08:25.640
Great idea!

08:25.680 --> 08:28.710
I just need like $300 worth of quarters!

08:28.750 --> 08:30.520
Okay, better idea.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.850
I know a Donkey King game
you can play for free.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.789
You do?
Yeah!

08:34.820 --> 08:36.590
Joystick, button.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.659

08:49.700 --> 08:51.610
No, if you didn't lose,

08:51.640 --> 08:55.680
why did the game make the
wa-wa- waaahh sound?

08:55.710 --> 08:57.580
This is stupid.

08:57.610 --> 08:58.610
You didn't train this way
when you became a cop.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.750

09:02.780 --> 09:04.520

09:23.570 --> 09:27.640
There. The perfect outfit to wear
while you're out with this boy.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.710
I'm not going out with
Nigel dressed like this.

09:32.850 --> 09:35.620
Of course not.

09:35.650 --> 09:37.820
No riot gear is complete without this mask.

09:37.850 --> 09:40.920
You know, in case you need
to deploy the tear gas.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.560
No. No.
Just put that on...

09:42.590 --> 09:44.560
Stand down.
Stand down.

09:45.790 --> 09:48.530
Excuse me for worrying.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.930
It's just that you're my daughter,

09:49.960 --> 09:51.770

09:57.570 --> 09:59.870

Hello? I asked you a question
like two minutes ago.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.540
Huh?

11:09.570 --> 11:11.540
You know what?

11:11.570 --> 11:12.910
Maybe I should chaperone.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.810
What? No! No! No! No!

11:14.840 --> 11:17.540
I would die if you came.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.750
Promise me you will not come anywhere
near the roller rink tonight.

11:20.780 --> 11:21.780
Okay.

11:22.820 --> 11:25.850
I promise.

11:25.890 --> 11:28.750
I'll let my little baby go out
with a boy all by herself.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.720
Dad, are you crying?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.890
Of course not.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.860
It's just

11:35.890 --> 11:37.700
there's tear gas left on this uniform.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.730
There actually is tear gas on that uniform!

11:44.770 --> 11:45.700
Go get your father a cold washcloth.

11:53.710 --> 11:54.580
Angus, I need your help.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.840
Why should I help you?

11:59.810 --> 12:00.880
What do you need?

12:07.690 --> 12:09.750
Whoa!

12:09.790 --> 12:11.660
You know, this is a lot
harder in real life.

12:14.890 --> 12:17.560
Uh-oh.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.660
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>hold onto me?</i>

12:21.900 --> 12:22.900
Okay.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.670
Much better.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.580
Hey, guys.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.880
Gibson?

12:38.910 --> 12:40.880
You know, if you're having trouble,

12:40.920 --> 12:42.750
I could show you a few moves.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.550
Oh, no, that's okay, we're...

12:44.590 --> 12:47.920
And five, four, three, two, burst!

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
Up, punch, across.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.630
And crank.

12:52.660 --> 12:55.800
Crank. Stay down.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.870
Shoulder. Chin.
Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.800
And pat.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.770
Double dream hands.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.810
Two step clap!

13:04.840 --> 13:05.210
Reach to the audience!

13:05.240 --> 13:08.550
And butterfly.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.880
Double dream hands.

13:09.910 --> 13:10.650
Freestyle!

13:13.620 --> 13:15.650
And punch!

13:15.690 --> 13:18.850
Hey! Careful, Gibson.
You're not wearing a helmet.

13:18.890 --> 13:19.960
Sure I am.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.630
You want to borrow it?
No, no, that's okay. It's...

13:27.800 --> 13:33.540
Wow, you sure do sweat a lot, don't you?

13:33.570 --> 13:35.540
You think that one's bad,
check out this one.

13:35.570 --> 13:36.940
You're wearing another one?

13:36.980 --> 13:39.910
Kidding! What kind of dork
would wear two hair helmets?

13:47.950 --> 13:49.860
She'll never learn to love again.

13:53.890 --> 13:57.730
Dad, are you watching a
chick flick and crying?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.700
Of course not.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.670
There's tear gas left on this pillow.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.610
Why is this stuff all over the house?

14:07.740 --> 14:10.580
I have got to learn to wash my hands

14:10.610 --> 14:11.040
when I come home from work.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.550
Well, let's go.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.850
We have to get to the
Donkey King tournament.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.820
Sorry, Cam. You're going
to have to go without me.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.550
Chyna's at the roller rink

14:19.590 --> 14:21.560
and I promised her I would not intrude.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.060
Of course.

14:23.090 --> 14:28.630
For years you've gone to her concerts,
recitals, awards presentations.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.870
Finally, I do something
that eclipses all of that

14:31.900 --> 14:33.870
and you're not even going to come.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.770
Because I have a feeling
I'm going to win tonight.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.540
I don't know what to do.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.780
Chyna's there with this boy...

14:41.810 --> 14:43.810
Well, actually, it's just a
kid inside of a machine.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.610
Wait, I've got an idea.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.780
Seriously?

14:51.650 --> 14:52.720
This is your idea?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.790
This is a great disguise.

14:55.820 --> 14:57.690
Chyna won't know I'm here,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.530
and people keep giving me quarters.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.830
Oh, look out!

15:08.740 --> 15:09.840
Insert coin.

15:13.710 --> 15:14.710
Insert coin.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.510
What? I already did.

15:16.550 --> 15:18.750
Stupid machine!

15:29.660 --> 15:30.860
Thanks for helping me out, Angus.

15:30.890 --> 15:33.560
I've got to stop Nigel
from stealing my girl.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.700
I get it.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.730
If that glorified toaster
oven came after my Olive,

15:36.770 --> 15:39.670
he'd end up in
a scrap heap. Turn.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.540
Are you sure you can hack
into Nigel's system?

15:46.580 --> 15:47.910
Are you kidding?

15:47.940 --> 15:50.680
Right now, I am directing the
cameras <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

15:50.710 --> 15:51.810
Camera two, cut to Jay.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.850
Turn.

15:56.850 --> 15:59.760
This is cool.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.720
We're kind of, sort of,
almost sharing a milkshake.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.800
Hey! Not too fast,
you'll get brain freeze.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.630
Three, two, one.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.770
Nigel?

16:10.800 --> 16:11.800
Nigel?

16:12.940 --> 16:16.510
You got everything freeze!

16:16.540 --> 16:19.810
I just spilled a spot of tea
on the blinkin' gogglebox.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.580
<i>But no need to get</i>
<i>the collywobbles,</i>

16:22.610 --> 16:25.470
it seems the sound
is still peachy-keen.

16:35.010 --> 16:35.850
Yes!

16:36.150 --> 16:38.140
Just beat my high score!

16:39.420 --> 16:41.540
See? And Olive's
not even here.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.170
I guess you psyched her out

16:43.200 --> 16:44.740
and she was too afraid to show up.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.340
Something like that.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.110
Better get to the roller rink.

16:50.150 --> 16:51.460
What the heck?

16:52.680 --> 16:53.680
Barrel.

16:55.950 --> 16:57.920
Barrel.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.150
Oh, apple.
Bonus points.

17:06.619 --> 17:09.530
You think you can stop me?
I'm the champ!

17:24.750 --> 17:27.750
Now, let's see who's
inside this donkey suit.

17:30.690 --> 17:31.790
Wacky the Wolf!

17:34.960 --> 17:36.720
Oh!

17:43.770 --> 17:46.630
<i>You stink!</i>

17:46.670 --> 17:48.600
Perhaps you should take
those skates off your feet

17:48.640 --> 17:49.870
and put them on
your bum-bum.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.740
Hey. I'm trying.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.780
<i>Trying to do what?</i>
<i>Make people laugh?</i>

17:57.810 --> 17:59.510
Because you're so gobsmacking awful

17:59.550 --> 18:03.550
you make a Buckingham Palace
guard bust a gut snickering.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.590
Why are you suddenly being such a jerk?

18:10.620 --> 18:12.530
No, I didn't say that!

18:14.600 --> 18:16.800
If you don't like it, perhaps you
should go out with someone else.

18:16.830 --> 18:21.630
Like that sweet, caring,
boyishly handsome Fletcher.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.600
Maybe I will!

18:24.640 --> 18:25.840
Yes!

18:25.870 --> 18:30.810
I mean... Yes, Jeeves,
do bring the pony around,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.580
I'd like to play a round of polo.

18:32.610 --> 18:33.950
Pip pip! Huzzah!

18:36.780 --> 18:39.590
Hey, Cam, looks like you're going to win.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.560
We'll see about that!

18:43.560 --> 18:45.530
Uh-oh.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.530
Wacky told me everything!

18:47.560 --> 18:48.730
Including some weird personal stuff.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.830
You knew you couldn't beat me,

18:52.870 --> 18:55.570
so you set up a real life Donkey King game

18:55.600 --> 18:56.870
to try to make sure I never showed up.

18:57.910 --> 18:59.610
Cameron? Is that true?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.540
That's genius!

19:02.880 --> 19:04.840
Well, I'm out of here.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.810
What? Just when
she shows up

19:06.850 --> 19:08.580
you're going to give up on me?

19:08.620 --> 19:11.620
No. Snac-Man needs to go
to the Snac-Men's room

19:11.650 --> 19:12.750
and deposit a roll of quarters.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.490
I can't believe I thought you were cute.

19:20.530 --> 19:21.800
Well, I'm not cute!
I'm hideous.

19:21.830 --> 19:25.870
<i>And if you don't like it,</i>
<i>well, too bad!</i>

19:25.900 --> 19:26.730
This is the real me.

19:26.770 --> 19:30.540
My name is Nigel and I'm a dodgy plonker.

19:31.570 --> 19:32.910
Fletcher, I can see you.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.640
<i>Do something!</i>

19:36.680 --> 19:37.610
Got it. Power surge!

19:40.810 --> 19:41.880
Whoa!

19:48.850 --> 19:49.920
Dad?

19:54.590 --> 19:57.760
What?
The scores got erased!

19:57.800 --> 19:59.760
No fair!
I was beating you!

20:02.730 --> 20:03.830
We both have zero?

20:05.700 --> 20:08.770
I'm tied for the
championship! Woohoo!

20:08.810 --> 20:10.710
Yes! Yes!

20:13.740 --> 20:15.610
Dad! I know
you're in there!

20:17.980 --> 20:20.750
And, Fletcher, I know you're in there!

20:21.780 --> 20:22.750
<i>Hi, Chyna.</i>

20:23.920 --> 20:25.690
I see what's going on here.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.560
<i>You do?</i>

20:28.590 --> 20:30.860
Yes, my dad put you up to this.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.830
He didn't want me going out with Nigel

20:32.860 --> 20:35.760
so he cooked up this scheme
to try to make him look bad.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.900
No, that's not true.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.770
You're hiding inside an arcade game.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.700
Only because I...

20:45.740 --> 20:46.940
<i>He wanted to make sure</i> <i>I went
along</i> <i>with his evil plan!</i>

20:46.970 --> 20:49.640
<i>I didn't want to,</i>
<i>but your father forced me.</i>

20:51.980 --> 20:53.950
<i>You make me sick.</i>

20:58.980 --> 21:01.820
<i>Hi, Chyna.</i> <i>Do you know if we
have</i> <i>any cranberry sauce?</i>

21:08.960 --> 21:10.860
I'm sorry about last night, Nigel.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.660
My dad can get a little nutso.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.760
But I guess I understand.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.990
After all, I am his
daughter and he's my dad.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.060
My brother's ** just ** you.

21:24.130 --> 21:26.250
Why don't we try again ** Saturday?

21:26.390 --> 21:28.330
We can go **.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.690
Don't you wear like 3,000 pounds.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.390
Good point.

21:32.950 --> 21:35.890
Beside... I don't think I'm ready for a boyfriend.
