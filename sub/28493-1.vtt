03:19.700 --> 03:23.902
Don't hide from me, 'cause
I will always find you.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.538
You think you get away,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.373
but I'm in your head.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.428
I am 8 Ball the Clown.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.898
And I became a clown

03:52.900 --> 03:54.700
to entertain,

03:54.702 --> 03:56.268
to create laughter,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.737
and to make people happy.

03:58.739 --> 04:03.809
I was so filled with
rage and the pain burned.

04:04.612 --> 04:08.814
Oh, how it burned in my brain

04:08.816 --> 04:10.949
eating at me,

04:10.951 --> 04:13.318
and feeding my addiction.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.821
I tried to make it go away

04:15.823 --> 04:18.589
to soothe the pain with a little

04:18.591 --> 04:20.325
opioid here and there.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.862
And so my addiction
grew out of control,

04:23.864 --> 04:25.764
and I could no longer

04:25.766 --> 04:27.499
contain

04:27.501 --> 04:28.567
the rage.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.535
It would not stop,

04:30.537 --> 04:31.837
and so I spewed

04:31.839 --> 04:32.904
destruction.

04:34.508 --> 04:38.677
There have been a handful
of dark times in my life.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.846
And these are by
far the darkest.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.782
My emotions swirls,

04:43.784 --> 04:45.884
opioids run through my veins

04:45.886 --> 04:47.853
injecting whatever I can find

04:47.855 --> 04:49.921
to get my next fix.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.458
And it's never enough.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.729
Never enough, so I keep
going deeper and deeper

04:57.731 --> 05:00.032
into the depths of hell,

05:00.034 --> 05:02.567
shattering the
dreams and illusions

05:02.569 --> 05:05.404
of being the
greatest clown ever.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.442
I kill for no reason

05:10.444 --> 05:12.377
other than pure

05:12.379 --> 05:14.513
euphoria,

05:14.515 --> 05:18.884
seeking to dull the
painful demons in my brain,

05:18.886 --> 05:20.752
if just for a moment

05:20.754 --> 05:24.056
avoiding reality
which is my failure.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.792
I used to be stable

05:26.794 --> 05:28.794
and quite entertaining.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.830
But over time, people
became afraid of clowns.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.498
They feared clowns.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.001
And even despised clowns.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.071
For that, they
will certainly pay.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.107
Oh they will pay dearly

05:42.109 --> 05:46.912
for the sinful acts that
have been disposed on me.

05:48.349 --> 05:51.016
Laughing at me, not with me.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.951
They beg for their lives.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.653
They want mercy,

05:54.655 --> 05:57.022
and I take away their pain.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.025
China white, brown tie,

06:00.027 --> 06:01.393
Mexican crude,

06:01.395 --> 06:03.562
or synthetic bliss.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.764
That's all you need to know.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.900
Lately, I've been
feeling unstable again.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.068
And my addiction

06:10.070 --> 06:11.837
has evolved

06:11.839 --> 06:13.405
into an insatiable

06:13.407 --> 06:15.440
lust for killing.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.908
And I don't just kill.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.011
I bring them to my god.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.781
Flowing through their veins

06:22.783 --> 06:24.950
in a precarious manner,

06:24.952 --> 06:25.884
bringing the pleasure,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.954
and euphoria, and the pain

06:28.956 --> 06:30.989
of certain death.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.560
I am 8-Ball the Clown.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.930
And I will make you happy.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.765
Oh yes.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.966
Oh yes.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.137
You will be happy.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.875
This I can assure you.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.944
I don't know.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.781
What?

07:30.451 --> 07:31.516
Who are you?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.151
Who are you?

07:34.755 --> 07:35.887
I don't know.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.741
What the fuck?

07:57.511 --> 07:58.677
That didn't just happen.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.911
Oh god.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.947
This heroine must be cut
with some dirty shit.

08:01.949 --> 08:02.781
This can't be real.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.216
Okay, okay, okay.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.117
Okay, regain composure.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.552
I got to,

08:07.554 --> 08:08.820
I got to go finish
what I started.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.722
I got to finish what I started.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.896
Oh god.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.131
This can't be fucking real.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.912
Jesus, stop.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.996
My magic hat.

09:09.816 --> 09:10.816
Back

09:11.785 --> 09:12.785
to paradise.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.055
Ah.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.824
Ah.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.337
Oh.

10:24.992 --> 10:25.992
Okay.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.128
Hello miss.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.129
What can I do for you?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.831
I'm here about that baby stuff

10:32.833 --> 10:35.033
you listed on the internet.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.234
- Ah yes, the baby stuff.
- It's a boy.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.170
It does look like you
got a little one on board,

10:39.172 --> 10:40.338
don't you.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.840
Due any day now.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.074
Yes, seems like he'll
be coming out real soon.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.976
Yeah, the ad said
there was some,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.177
some toys and clothes.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.080
They said it was a crib

10:49.082 --> 10:50.715
and like some...

10:50.717 --> 10:51.950
Yeah, I got a baby seat too.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.218
I'm sorry, my manners.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.119
Come on in, please.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.186
Please, come in.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.055
Everything's just down there.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.191
So what are you, like
a clown or something?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.026
Yeah.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.394
Yeah, I sure am.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.262
I mean the kids just love me.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.430
I actually have a
surprise party planned

11:05.432 --> 11:06.665
for later tonight.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.904
Well it sounds like your parties

11:12.906 --> 11:14.105
a lot of fun.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.775
Oh, my parties are to die for.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.246
Well maybe you can do
my kid's birthday party.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.249
Oh, I'd be delighted to.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.021
Shh.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.191
Shh.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.259
Shh shh shh.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.208
Please watch your surroundings.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.277
Do not hesitate

11:52.279 --> 11:53.311
to call 911.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.415
All right.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.729
Please be precaution
of these children.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.464
Pick them up from school.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.499
Make sure they know

12:14.501 --> 12:16.434
cause these clowns
are everywhere.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.870
City has been overwhelmed

12:18.872 --> 12:21.523
with these clown sightings.

12:21.524 --> 12:24.175
We'll keep you updated on
the Day nine o'clock news and.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.979
This is Juanita
Foster signing off.

12:27.981 --> 12:28.981
See ya.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.890
Ambiance.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.297
Yes, yes.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.291
Here we go.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.426
Just.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.868
Got to put a little
cover on your face.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.837
Make sure you're
here for the party.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.277
Oh, so cute.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.454
Yeah, just a little,

13:43.456 --> 13:46.591
just a little dab will do you.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.998
Yeah, I want you
to look beautiful

13:54.868 --> 13:56.301
when you're having that kid.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.605
It's a very special
event, after all.

14:05.512 --> 14:09.180
Alright, thanks
for holding that.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.182
Let's see.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.586
Right.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.634
Oh no, that's too good.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.908
Alright, now

14:36.910 --> 14:38.409
we just got to figure

14:38.411 --> 14:40.378
how to get the baby out.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.282
I know there's
something around here.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.290
No, no.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.292
Fun but

14:54.027 --> 14:55.994
not delicate enough.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.295
I could,

14:59.466 --> 15:00.466
no, too blunt.

15:02.269 --> 15:06.070
Hmm, that's a thought.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.976
No, I need a more precise hand.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.547
Of course, trusty rusty.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.549
My old friend.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.287
You will do the job.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.458
But not just yet.

15:33.133 --> 15:33.965
No.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.233
Stop it.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.334
What are you doing?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.368
No.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.303
What are you doing?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.404
You are being very naughty.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.438
If you persist,

15:40.440 --> 15:45.109
I am going to cut
your voice box.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.679
And then you're not gonna
make any more noises, okay.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.380
What do you want from me?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.349
What do you want?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.350
To be happy,

15:52.352 --> 15:53.384
just like everybody else.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.385
Don't do this.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.387
I think I deserve it.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.555
Oh, oh, my.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.058
No, no.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.526
I want your baby.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.229
No.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.598
Don't.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.666
Don't worry, don't worry.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.667
No.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.789
Your baby's gonna be fine.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.438
I've done this
many times before.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.574
Let me go.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.377
No, no, no, no, no.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.713
Why don't you go to sleep, okay.

16:21.715 --> 16:22.547
No.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.481
No.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.049
Let me get you something

16:25.051 --> 16:26.517
- for your pain.
- Please no.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.519
No.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.620
No.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.626
Shh.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.096
Sleep tight.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.464
Sleep tight.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.401
We've got a lot of work to do.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.567
Little buddy.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.076
Hey.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.377
Hey, welcome.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.378
Buddy.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.750
This is your world now.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.621
It's a boy.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.189
It's a boy.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.165
Say bye to mommy.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.633
She's not gonna make it.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.514
I love you.

18:05.518 --> 18:09.220
Welcome to the
world, little guy.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.523
It's gonna be a lifetime
of laughter and love,

18:14.194 --> 18:15.560
and heroine.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.864
But every baby boy
needs juice, right.

18:19.866 --> 18:20.866
Mother's milk

18:21.801 --> 18:23.534
to make us big and strong.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.439
Oh, welcome, welcome.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.775
All of this will be yours.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.511
You will be the
greatest clown ever.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.719
Oh, the games we'll play.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.791
It'll be a party every day.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.197
I always knew I'd be a good dad.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.366
I don't care what they say.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.406
It's not true what they say.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.909
Clowns never eat their young.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.618
Welcome to the
world, little guy.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.653
It'll be what you make it.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.893
I bet you're hungry too.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.661
Don't worry,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.630
I'll get you
something real soon.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.851
Oh, I know what you need.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.759
The first

19:55.695 --> 19:56.928
step

19:56.930 --> 19:59.530
in a journey of
a thousand miles.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.335
There you go.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.318
Sleep tight little baby.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.827
It's okay.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.599
Shh.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.840
Everything's gonna be fine now.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.672
Don't worry drama.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.309
I know what you need.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.478
I know what you need.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.322
My god.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.725
Holy fuck, you scared
the shit out of me

22:07.727 --> 22:09.393
you fucking asshole.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.395
God.

23:05.451 --> 23:07.118
Man, you look like hell.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.820
You'd look like hell too

23:09.822 --> 23:11.055
if you were a clown.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.823
Nobody likes clowns anymore.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.525
But dammit, the world needs us.

23:17.764 --> 23:18.896
I don't know what's
so bad about clowns.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.830
I mean you're right,

23:19.832 --> 23:20.765
everyone needs clowns.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.800
Everyone needs to laugh.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.736
Man, look at you.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.937
- I don't want to.
- Jesus.

23:26.939 --> 23:27.938
Look at you.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.773
Yeah.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.775
You're drunk.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.593
Judge my drinking.

23:32.594 --> 23:34.744
Oh, I'm not judging,
I need a ride.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.781
You don't know
why I drink, okay.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.848
I drink because

23:37.850 --> 23:39.917
I got a lot of pain.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.887
You think you have
pain, try being a clown.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.995
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.930
Maybe if you didn't drink,

23:52.932 --> 23:54.899
you'd still have your kids.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.068
I don't know why
we fight so much.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.937
Have you ever
tried being a clown?

23:59.939 --> 24:00.871
She might like that.

24:00.873 --> 24:01.972
Never.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.325
Never been a clown before.

24:04.326 --> 24:05.776
You got to bring a little
spice to the bedroom.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.111
You're right.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.179
That's a good idea.

24:08.181 --> 24:09.513
I might try that.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.681
How much do one of those cost?

24:10.683 --> 24:11.849
I'll do it for free.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.934
It's not like it'll
make things worse.

24:21.861 --> 24:22.827
All right, Balloon,

24:22.829 --> 24:24.695
show me the hairy.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.100
I got little

24:30.102 --> 24:32.503
something more than brown stone.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.671
Oh yeah?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.773
I got some shit that's
gonna fuck you up.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.243
This is what they
call blue lady.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.579
Blue lady?

24:41.581 --> 24:42.680
Yeah.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.081
What the fuck?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.218
I hope it's not like
that last batch man.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.753
That shit had me fucking
walking like a zombie.

24:49.755 --> 24:50.621
I woke up,

24:50.623 --> 24:52.256
I woke up in a crypt.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.791
Okay.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.726
Yes, some new shit man.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.628
All the kids doing it.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.996
Well if it's good for kids,

24:58.998 --> 25:00.798
it's good for clowns.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.701
It's like a little
bit of Mr. Brownstone

25:03.703 --> 25:05.803
mixed with some meth.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.004
You can light it,

25:07.006 --> 25:08.005
snort it,

25:08.007 --> 25:09.240
smoke it,

25:09.242 --> 25:11.008
or shoot it.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.610
Let's do it all.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.945
Yeah.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.046
Come on.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.882
Shit, let's fire some up man.

25:17.884 --> 25:18.983
Okay.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.587
Let's go old school.

25:23.589 --> 25:24.755
Yeah man.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.823
Let's do it.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.159
Just plop some there.

25:33.966 --> 25:34.965
We're gonna get fucked up.

25:34.967 --> 25:35.900
Right.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.034
I'm looking forward to this.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.303
Okay, okay, okay.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.038
This one's a little tricky.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.907
Why don't you
light it up for us.

25:42.909 --> 25:43.909
Gotcha man.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.850
Yeah man, this is
gonna be great.

25:53.986 --> 25:54.985
I'm telling you man,

25:54.987 --> 25:56.987
this is the best.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.119
Holy fuck.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.255
Fuck.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.196
Oh shit.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.198
God fuck.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.100
Oh.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.270
Isn't that some good shit, bro?

26:46.272 --> 26:47.272
Fuck.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.008
Oh.

26:50.810 --> 26:51.810
Yeah.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.280
How you gonna pay up man?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.749
I ain't no fucking charity.

26:58.751 --> 27:03.187
Man, you know I
don't have any money.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.189
What?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.157
What do you mean you
don't have any money, man?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.058
I don't,

27:08.060 --> 27:09.860
I'm a fucking clown.

27:09.862 --> 27:10.794
So?

27:10.796 --> 27:11.996
I don't make any money.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.664
What about your
last victim, man,

27:13.666 --> 27:14.398
that you killed?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.333
Did you take his fucking wallet?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.668
It's gone.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.169
What do you mean it's gone?

27:19.171 --> 27:20.137
I got nothing.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.171
What the fuck does that men?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.773
Nothing but trusty rusty.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.374
Dude, what the fuck
am I supposed to do

27:24.377 --> 27:25.409
with all this shit?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.111
I, I, I don't know.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.746
Get the fuck out of here, man.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.080
You fucking suck
as a clown, man.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.749
The fuck did you say?

27:31.751 --> 27:34.118
Fuck you, you fucking wannabe

27:34.120 --> 27:35.419
washed up piece of shit.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.854
Bullshit.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.055
Go back to
the circus or something,

27:38.057 --> 27:40.190
you fucking big motherfucker.

27:42.662 --> 27:43.293
Okay.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.662
Okay. Fuck.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.096
Go make some fucking money, man.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.064
Oh, how about I try,

27:47.066 --> 27:48.032
how about I try

27:48.034 --> 27:50.134
to steal from Balloon.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.043
8 Ball bitch.

28:01.747 --> 28:02.747
You,

28:03.683 --> 28:04.882
yes, yes, yes, of course.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.150
Always come prepared.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.156
Hmm.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.926
You almost look the part.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.034
Almost.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.036
Tricky.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.872
Perfect.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.055
Yes.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.091
The festive clown.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.826
So send me a message,

28:48.828 --> 28:51.295
and I'll call you right back.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.164
You need to hear this.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.265
It's funny as hell.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.467
What is it?

28:56.469 --> 28:57.468
Wiggles the Clown.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.103
His answering machine message.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.807
Hey, you've
reached 8 Ball the Clown.

29:03.809 --> 29:06.276
I'm out making children happy.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.512
So twerk me a message

29:08.514 --> 29:10.414
and I'll call you right back.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.917
He's stupid.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.393
You need to stop luring
kids into the woods,

29:23.395 --> 29:25.062
you creep.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.263
Hey, you've
reached 8 Ball the Clown.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.899
I'm out making children happy.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.135
So twerk me a message

29:31.137 --> 29:33.237
and I'll call you right back.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.239
Fucking kids.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.474
Clowns suck.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.517
Drunk looser.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.053
Ewe.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.222
Hey, it's 8 Ball the Clown.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.158
I'm out making children happy.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.360
You ruin birthday parties

29:56.362 --> 29:59.396
just because you're
a drunk looser.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.204
You're a sick, demented asshole.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.273
You're a horrible clown.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.308
Yeah, I bet you
live in the dumpster.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.852
No, he probably
lives in the sewer.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.382
True.

30:23.889 --> 30:24.889
Hold on.

30:27.860 --> 30:28.959
Alright.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.059
Alright man, please
stop banging on my door.

30:30.062 --> 30:30.994
I got a baby sleeping.

30:30.996 --> 30:31.929
I'm not trying to buy nothing.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.030
Man, I ain't selling anything.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.131
I'm not selling nothing.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.265
I'm just looking for my wife.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.533
I don't...

30:36.535 --> 30:38.035
Where my wife at?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.002
I don't get many
visitors here man.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.270
I haven't seen her man.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.538
My wife's car sitting
in front of your house.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.007
I haven't seen any strange
ladies hanging around.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.342
Have you seen her?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.577
Well maybe she had the baby.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.045
I don't...

30:48.047 --> 30:49.012
Have you checked the hospitals?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.314
What you mean about a baby?

30:50.316 --> 30:51.348
You just said she's pregnant.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.850
Man, the car's
sitting right there.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.518
Okay, please feel
free to look around.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.355
You're not gonna find her here.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.367
Meet baby daddy.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.902
Hello.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.407
Well, he was, he
would have been, but.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.352
Well, looks like baby's daddy

32:02.354 --> 32:04.621
is gonna be joining a momma

32:04.623 --> 32:07.457
for a night of fun
and excitement.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.292
Yes.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.593
Yes.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.461
It's gonna be a great time.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.331
Come on, drama.

32:14.333 --> 32:18.001
We've got some party
favors to put together.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.438
No, no, stay there.

32:33.686 --> 32:34.618
This is Steve Yeager

32:34.620 --> 32:36.453
with WD5 TV

32:36.455 --> 32:38.722
and we're talking
with Erica Collins,

32:38.724 --> 32:40.390
a 13 year old student

32:40.392 --> 32:41.725
who was recently
attacked by a clown.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.328
Erica, could you tell
us what happened?

32:44.330 --> 32:46.163
Well, I was walking
my dog by the reservoir.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.632
And she slipped off her leash

32:48.634 --> 32:50.133
and took off running.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.101
Well of course I went after her.

32:51.103 --> 32:51.735
Well that's understandable.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.737
So what happened next?

32:56.075 --> 32:57.374
Well I was looking
around for her

32:57.376 --> 32:59.343
when someone came up and
grabbed me from behind.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.178
I tried to,

33:02.448 --> 33:03.547
I tried to scream,

33:03.548 --> 33:04.868
but he put his
hand over my mouth.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.453
That had to be terrifying.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.654
What was going
through your mind?

33:10.656 --> 33:11.488
I'm dead.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.723
He's going to kill me.

33:12.725 --> 33:15.225
And he whispered the
creepiest thing to me.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.593
And what was that?

33:19.431 --> 33:20.430
That's horrible.

33:20.432 --> 33:21.431
But you got away.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.466
How'd you do that?

33:26.138 --> 33:28.105
She's small but she attacked.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.539
And when I looked behind me,

33:29.541 --> 33:30.640
he was gone.

33:31.744 --> 33:34.411
Wow, were you able
to give the police

33:34.413 --> 33:35.712
a good description?

33:35.714 --> 33:37.314
For sure.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.517
Well thank you for sharing

33:40.519 --> 33:41.752
your terrible
experience with us.

33:41.754 --> 33:44.621
What are you doing?

33:44.623 --> 33:46.123
Pranking the clown.

33:46.125 --> 33:46.757
What clown?

33:46.759 --> 33:47.758
Wiggles.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.792
His message is funny.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.327
His message might be funny,

33:50.329 --> 33:51.595
but stop.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.063
All the kids do it.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.498
Have you seen
what's on the news?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.100
All the stuff about the clowns?

33:56.101 --> 33:57.701
I really wouldn't be pranking
that clown right now.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.269
We were just having fun.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.537
At his expense?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.172
Just leave him alone.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.507
He's probably gonna come
over here all pissed off.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.175
Why?

34:05.177 --> 34:06.443
Hang it up and stop.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.078
Why would you fuck
around with a clown?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.545
He could find out
where you live.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.481
School's been canceled tomorrow.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.483
Yay.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.751
School is boring.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.585
Yeah, but it's not
that much of yay.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.588
It's canceled cause of
the clown sightings.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.489
Can we stay up late?

34:19.491 --> 34:21.091
Not real late.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.793
You can stay up
until I get home.

34:22.795 --> 34:23.949
Sure.

34:23.951 --> 34:25.106
Oh yeah, and mom
will be back tomorrow,

34:25.107 --> 34:26.262
so you guys need to
clean this stuff up.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.697
Alright, I got it.

34:27.699 --> 34:28.697
Just go.

34:28.699 --> 34:29.833
Should be back around 11 or so.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.501
So don't answer the door.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.803
Call me if you need anything.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.572
And watch out for the clowns.

34:36.507 --> 34:37.239
That's not fucking funny.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.475
Nice language.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.476
Thank you.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.235
Help.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.552
Oh you dirty girl.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.357
You've thrown up
all over yourself.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.626
Clowns know how to
hold their juices.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.698
How you doing, honey?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.504
You're looking a little rough.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.375
Why aren't you happy?

35:45.377 --> 35:46.643
You look like you should be.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.649
You know,

35:54.453 --> 35:56.319
god told me I need to make

35:56.321 --> 35:58.421
as many people happy as I can.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.691
So, I'm just doing
what I got to.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.633
What's that?

36:09.635 --> 36:11.468
You got something to say?

36:12.371 --> 36:13.703
Don't hold back.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.406
There's no judgment here.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.645
You're in my happy place,

36:21.647 --> 36:23.747
so you should learn to be happy.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.521
You know I got these
balloons special for you.

36:33.659 --> 36:34.958
What's that?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.233
Oh, I kill myself.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.403
I kill everyone.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.348
Don't.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.287
Heroine is like

37:04.289 --> 37:07.591
inhaling the breath of God.

37:07.593 --> 37:10.760
There is nothing more euphoric

37:10.762 --> 37:13.230
than sticking a
needle in my arm.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.433
The slow penetration,

37:16.435 --> 37:19.302
as the warmth of a her orgasm

37:19.304 --> 37:22.606
slowly moves through my body,

37:22.608 --> 37:24.674
mixing with the blood

37:24.676 --> 37:26.776
in a macabre dance

37:26.778 --> 37:28.011
of utterly

37:28.013 --> 37:29.813
fascinating fantasy.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.551
Oh, the pure,

37:34.553 --> 37:37.654
white liquid lady heroine

37:37.656 --> 37:40.657
as she pulls me deep inside her,

37:40.659 --> 37:41.992
suckling me.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.565
Oh, I will humiliate you.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.768
I will manipulate you.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.470
I will lie to you.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.039
I will defile you.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.474
I will cut you.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.409
I will kill you.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.043
Because heroine,

38:00.045 --> 38:02.712
heroine is my god.

38:02.714 --> 38:05.515
And my faith is strong.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.585
Now you,

38:09.621 --> 38:11.288
now you

38:11.290 --> 38:13.657
will get to feel the pure

38:13.659 --> 38:15.925
pleasure and pain

38:15.927 --> 38:18.762
of my god.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.502
What's wrong with you?

38:29.875 --> 38:30.875
What?

38:33.679 --> 38:34.844
Hey, buddy.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.014
Buddy.

38:37.749 --> 38:38.848
Oh shit.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.951
Shit.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.486
Hello.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.754
Oh no.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.389
Oh god.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.424
Who's gonna play with me now.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.725
Oh god, mom.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.093
Mom's gone.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.494
Oh god, I got to move the body.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.496
I got to clean this up.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.665
I got to, I got to do something.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.766
Oh god.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.001
Okay, okay.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.537
Not expected, not expected.

39:03.608 --> 39:04.908
Will this help?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.777
Something better.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.814
Something bigger
to clean this up.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.084
I don't know.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.586
Oh god, mom can't see this.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.588
Fuck.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.724
That's okay.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.059
Maintain positive attitude.

39:28.734 --> 39:32.369
Oh shit.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.404
Momma's not gonna like this,

39:34.406 --> 39:35.872
but I got a plan.

39:36.842 --> 39:37.842
It's okay.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.143
We'll make you smaller.

39:42.948 --> 39:43.948
Fuck that.

39:46.585 --> 39:47.585
You ready?

40:05.704 --> 40:07.704
Hey, you've
reached 8 Ball the Clown.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.906

40:54.019 --> 40:56.586
not to touch little children

40:57.522 --> 40:58.522

41:12.971 --> 41:15.238
Hey, you've

41:47.005 --> 41:48.905

Fucking kids.

43:00.712 --> 43:01.344

So twerk me a message

43:04.583 --> 43:07.116

43:20.665 --> 43:22.732
You little shits.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.634
What do you know
about being a clown?

43:24.636 --> 43:26.002
What do you know about
making people laugh?

43:26.004 --> 43:27.203
You think you're funny?

43:27.205 --> 43:28.771
You're not funny.

43:28.773 --> 43:29.872
You little fuckers.

43:43.888 --> 43:46.089
I'll fucking find you.

43:46.091 --> 43:47.991

Twerk me a message,

43:50.795 --> 43:52.328

43:52.330 --> 43:55.064
I can't do this anymore.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.736
You ruin birthday parties

43:59.738 --> 44:01.638
just because you're
a drunk looser.

44:56.895 --> 45:00.296
Huh, I found my old bobble head.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.397
This things fun.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.269
Kristine, turn
the light back on.

45:40.271 --> 45:41.838
It's not funny.

45:47.512 --> 45:49.779
Kristine, turn
the light back on.

45:49.781 --> 45:51.347
It's not funny.

45:53.218 --> 45:55.351
Kristine, open the door.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.889
Open the door, it's not funny.

46:04.062 --> 46:05.062
Kristine.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.032
Beautiful.

46:13.037 --> 46:14.203
Kristine, open the door.

46:19.110 --> 46:21.010
Kristine, open the door.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.445
Why the fuck did you do that?

46:22.447 --> 46:24.247
There's a clown in the garage.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.381
There's no clown.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.871
It just takes a little time.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.373
I'll find you little fuckers.

46:51.376 --> 46:53.109
Oh, I'll find you.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.511
Yeah.

46:55.513 --> 46:56.579
And then we'll play.

47:01.553 --> 47:03.286
Then we'll play.

47:10.962 --> 47:12.228
Fuckers,

47:14.299 --> 47:16.232
Oh, we'll see who's funny.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.403
We're gonna get together.

47:20.405 --> 47:23.339
You and your fucking sister.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.175
The two of you,

47:26.444 --> 47:28.377
you'll be my new playmates.

47:32.584 --> 47:34.250
We'll see who,

47:34.252 --> 47:35.412

47:47.265 --> 47:48.297

47:48.299 --> 47:49.299

47:50.368 --> 47:52.869
You want to tell me I suck?

47:52.871 --> 47:54.270
Well fuck you.

47:54.272 --> 47:56.606
You're suck is a cocks.

47:59.277 --> 48:00.643
Who's funny now?

48:09.621 --> 48:12.321
No, no, no, can't touch this.

48:14.893 --> 48:16.392
It's hammer time, motherfucker.

48:27.639 --> 48:29.272
You pathetic

48:29.274 --> 48:30.439
little man.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.376
Want to cast your judgements?

48:33.378 --> 48:35.311
Well fuck you,

48:35.313 --> 48:37.580
cause I got the last laugh.

48:45.390 --> 48:46.390
Yeah.

49:18.156 --> 49:19.221
Let's eat.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.549
In Baltimore.

51:26.551 --> 51:27.650
The first time I heard
anything about this,

51:27.652 --> 51:29.485
was in the morning show

51:29.487 --> 51:31.487
talking about clowns,
Brooklyn Berney,

51:31.489 --> 51:33.355
freaking people out.

51:33.357 --> 51:36.525
Man, has this gained momentum,

51:36.527 --> 51:38.594
especially with
Halloween coming up.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.362
This is crazy.

51:40.364 --> 51:41.597
Brian, what can you
tell us about these

51:41.599 --> 51:44.533
clowns popping up
all over the country?

51:44.535 --> 51:46.502
Nobody really
knows what's going on?

51:46.504 --> 51:47.470
Are these hoaxes?

51:47.472 --> 51:48.437
Are they real threats?

51:48.439 --> 51:49.738
We really don't know.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.207
But what we do know

51:51.209 --> 51:53.409
is that it made it
to the White House.

51:53.411 --> 51:54.643
It's really become a hot topic.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.579
The White House press secretary

51:56.581 --> 51:58.447
was asked about all these
clown sightings nationwide,

51:58.449 --> 52:00.683
and who would have thought this.

52:00.685 --> 52:03.452
You know, clowns,
the topic of clowns

52:03.454 --> 52:05.454
would make it to the White House

52:05.456 --> 52:07.156
and become part of an
official press release.

52:07.158 --> 52:08.591
Yeah.

52:08.593 --> 52:09.859
You know, it's kind of ironic

52:09.861 --> 52:11.594
going from talk
of all the clowns

52:11.596 --> 52:13.729
in the Senate and
Congress to this.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.731
Are they related?

52:15.733 --> 52:17.733
That's a good one, Jackson.

52:17.735 --> 52:20.136
Clowns, talking about clowns,

52:20.138 --> 52:22.538
press secretary taken
from the White House

52:22.540 --> 52:24.406
and is looking at
this seriously.

52:24.408 --> 52:26.475
And the president has been
briefed on the situation.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.345
While they're not taking
any immediate action,

52:29.347 --> 52:30.846
they have communicated
out to state officials

52:30.848 --> 52:32.581
to be vigilant.

52:32.583 --> 52:33.782
And in a statement to the press,

52:33.784 --> 52:35.551
they urged people to
take this seriously

52:35.553 --> 52:37.520
and not to prank or
try to scare someone.

52:37.522 --> 52:38.522
Man.

52:39.390 --> 52:41.157
I can't believe the president

52:41.159 --> 52:42.291
is talking about this.

52:42.293 --> 52:43.659
You got that right.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.461
Let the police departments
deal with them.

52:45.462 --> 52:47.262
These reports though coming
in all across the country.

52:47.265 --> 52:50.466
Kentucky today reported
that six schools shut down

52:50.468 --> 52:52.401
because of potential
clown threats.

52:52.403 --> 52:53.736
North Carolina's had them too.

52:53.738 --> 52:55.504
Florida has them.

52:55.506 --> 52:56.539
Washington has them.

52:56.541 --> 52:57.773
Oregon has them.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.175
And in Indiana,

52:59.177 --> 53:00.609
a man dressed as
a clown was shot

53:00.611 --> 53:02.511
just outside of a
shopping center.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.096
No report on his condition.

53:04.097 --> 53:05.680
So it's not
even safe being a clown.

53:05.683 --> 53:06.615
You might get shot.

53:06.617 --> 53:07.683
Clowns always freak me out.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.718
I got a little fear of clowns,

53:09.720 --> 53:11.687
but this thing keeps growing.

53:11.689 --> 53:12.855
I mean,

53:12.857 --> 53:14.890
what kind of effect
does that have

53:14.892 --> 53:16.525
on the legitimate clowns?

53:16.527 --> 53:17.426
Certainly, that's
got legitimate clowns

53:17.428 --> 53:18.627
nervous.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.628
And they're asking
people to remain calm.

53:19.630 --> 53:21.330
Don't panic.

53:21.332 --> 53:23.666
And most of all, don't shoot
unless your life is in danger.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.901
Yeah, if you got
a job as a clown,

53:25.903 --> 53:27.436
you probably don't want to

53:27.438 --> 53:29.238
commute wearing all
your makeup and a wig.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.940
You probably don't want
to walk around in public.

53:30.942 --> 53:34.510
So maybe you don't get ready
until you're at the event.

53:34.512 --> 53:37.713
Then you are probably gonna
clean up before you leave.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.648
That'll put a hurting on
their business, I bet.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.317
Sure.

53:41.319 --> 53:43.319
But they seem to be
remaining positive.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.854
The Baltimore police have
taken to social media

53:45.856 --> 53:48.624
saying you can't just
go shooting clowns.

53:48.626 --> 53:49.658
If you see a clown,

53:49.660 --> 53:50.759
don't shoot it

53:50.761 --> 53:51.961
unless the clown's breaking...

53:53.231 --> 53:54.330
Jesus Christ.

53:54.331 --> 53:55.430
You just can't go shoot a clown

53:55.433 --> 53:56.599
unless your life's in danger.

53:56.601 --> 53:57.566
In surrounding counties,

53:57.568 --> 53:59.051
many schools remain closed.

53:59.052 --> 54:00.535
And those that are open have
an active police presence.

54:00.538 --> 54:02.972
I mean this is really
getting serious.

54:02.974 --> 54:05.007
In Annapolis, several
high school kids

54:05.009 --> 54:06.408
were arrested for

54:06.410 --> 54:07.810
making near a school,

54:07.812 --> 54:09.945
which caused panic
earlier in the week.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.880
So not all this is real.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.849
A lot of it might
just be hoaxes.

54:13.851 --> 54:16.418
And kids, if you're
hearing this right now,

54:16.420 --> 54:17.586
listen to me.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.455
It's not a good time to do that.

54:19.457 --> 54:20.689
You might think it's funny,

54:20.691 --> 54:21.924
but you might get arrested,

54:21.926 --> 54:24.760
or worse you might
end up in the morgue.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.462
So before you
go out dressed as a clown,

54:26.464 --> 54:28.430
you might take some precautions.

54:28.432 --> 54:29.365
Sure.

54:29.367 --> 54:32.434
But what about the pranksters?

54:32.436 --> 54:34.403
You know, people.

54:34.405 --> 54:35.971
What the fuck?

54:35.973 --> 54:38.607
Well, as long as you're not

54:38.609 --> 54:39.642
out attacking people,

54:39.644 --> 54:40.804
breaking into houses, I mean.

54:42.847 --> 54:44.747
I'm making like some like,

54:44.749 --> 54:45.814
it's called family hello,

54:45.816 --> 54:50.853
but if you have a
certain name, like

54:52.456 --> 54:53.289
it's, it says,

54:53.291 --> 54:54.290
it like

54:54.292 --> 54:56.292
alert some message.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.589
Get well soon, motherfucker.

56:05.930 --> 56:07.096
You look so happy.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.569
And you look as happy
as when you died.

56:19.009 --> 56:20.642
Very nice.

56:20.644 --> 56:24.380
Let's get some more
color in there.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.715
Yes.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.056
Yes.

56:34.058 --> 56:35.924
To make sure nobody can

56:35.926 --> 56:38.127
mistake you for an unhappy man.

56:38.129 --> 56:41.730
I wish your mommy
could see you now.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.566
She'd be so happy.

56:44.802 --> 56:46.468
That's pretty good.

56:50.674 --> 56:52.941
Let's make sure we know.

57:01.185 --> 57:02.518
You look good.

57:03.721 --> 57:04.820
You look happy.

57:04.822 --> 57:06.822
Everyone should be happy.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.641
Got this thing over.

57:25.643 --> 57:26.775
Got it.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.610
It's a crazy moment.

57:28.612 --> 57:31.847
Listen kids,.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.148
It's a big thing.

57:34.718 --> 57:36.685
Most of it's
probably imagination.

57:36.687 --> 57:37.986
Hoaxes, just the though.

57:40.591 --> 57:41.591
So far...

57:43.961 --> 57:44.961
Squishy.

57:53.237 --> 57:54.797
We'll have to
keep an eye on this one.

58:01.245 --> 58:02.744
Take it easy
and have a good night.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.213
Clowns.

58:05.716 --> 58:07.483
This is Jackson on Rock 108.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.012
Food.

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:58.086
Yes.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.121
Shh.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:56.978
No shit, doc.

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:04.886
Where the fuck is my hat?

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.235
Fear of clowns.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.185
I fucking hate the phone.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.267
Where the fuck is Benny, bitch?

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.529
Alex, what the hell?

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.532
That was you, wasn't it Alex?

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:40.001
Why are you always
trying to scare me?

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:42.137
That was you, that was
the clown wasn't it?

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:43.271
I wasn't outside.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.140
It was you.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.274
Get out of here.

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.459
So you were the one calling me,

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.462
so I figured I'd call you back.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.533
Hey, how's it going?

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:15.971
Whatcha up to?

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:20.175
What do you want from us?

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:23.044
I want to see you laugh.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.679
I want to see you laugh,

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.014
and laugh,

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.382
and laugh.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.553
I want to make you have fun.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:32.387
What's wrong with you?

01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:34.389
Are you crazy?

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:35.991
You had plenty to say

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:37.692
on my answering machine,

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.094
didn't you?

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.429
You and your little
fucking brother.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.698
We were just pranking you.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.633
I'm just returning the call.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:48.203
You got a birthday
coming up soon?

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:49.771
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.172
Oh yeah?

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.008
And what are they gonna do?

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.109
Huh?

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:55.577
Tell me.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:57.512
Are they gonna protect you

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.048
from little ole me?

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.550
Just leave us alone.

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.152
Oh, I want to.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:09.391
But there's some games
we have to play first.

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.192
What games?

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.161
Oh you know,

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.563
just stuff to make you
feel like you're laughing.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.166
I'd like to introduce you to

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.070
religion.

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.372
What do you want from us?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.208
I want to see you laugh.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.576
I want to see you laugh,

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:29.744
and laugh,

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:30.746
and laugh.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:35.517
I want to make you have fun

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:38.553
until it hurts.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.360
How's your papa?

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:47.395
My dad's gonna kill you.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:51.699
Bet he's feeling
a little run down.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.439
One too many shots.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:09.451
Is your brother around, perhaps?

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.619
Just leave us alone.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.589
Cause you're both just
earned yourself a play date

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.323
with 8 Ball.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.729
And I love to play.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.466
That's precisely
why we hate clowns.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.804
Are you in our house?

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:29.497
Jesus Christ.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.599
Why did you do that?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.935
That was payback for what
you and your stupid friends did

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:36.404
to try and prank me
with that dumb clown.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.606
I didn't do that.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:39.607
Yeah, you did.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.442
How else did you get my number?

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:30.618
911, what's your emergency?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.686
It's a clown.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.488
There's a clown.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.489
Calm down.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:36.324
The clown's going to kill us.

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:38.726
Where is this clown?

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:39.861
Outside behind our house.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.496
Is it a man?

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.231
It's a fucking clown.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.965
I think we
have another clown hoax.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.634
It's not a hoax.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.802
It's a clown.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:48.770
Can you describe it?

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:50.772
What, it's a fucking clown.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.040
I goddamn clown.

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:53.641
What is there to describe?

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.810
Miss, calm down.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.979
Did you see any weapons?

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.480
No.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.516
Did he threaten you?

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:02.917
He said some creepy poem.

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.352
Send the police.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.521
Are you in a safe location?

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:07.789
Sort of.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.790
I locked the door.

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:09.924
Are your parents home?

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:11.342
No.

01:12:11.343 --> 01:12:12.759
Well is there
anyone else in the house?

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.729
My brother.

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:15.897
Where's he hiding?

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:16.798
I don't know.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.434
Tell me where
the fuck he's hiding.

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:20.668
Who is this?

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:24.505
Where the fuck is he hiding?

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.040
I don't know.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.676
Have you looked in the mirror?

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:40.621
Every one of us can
say we knew someone

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.857
who lived with the pain.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:45.593
Those who survived
within the shadows

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:47.528
of their terrorizers gains.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.831
The flames his lips

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:50.932
that whisper words

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:53.034
of easy passage.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:55.403
While they savage
garden after garden

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:58.005
until the all of
things are ravaged.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:00.742
There were far too many,

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:03.678
maybe even more than I knew

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.713
that felt the pain.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:06.914
Yet I'm insane.

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:09.751
I know that this is true.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:11.753
You run and hide so far

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:13.821
to get away from the pain.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:15.857
But still I know
the knife I left

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:18.559
is deeply cutting
inside your brain.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.795
Now, I have to go find

01:13:20.797 --> 01:13:23.831
your little brother

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.033
and fix him up.

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:50.925
One, two.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:53.928
I'm coming for you.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:57.799
Three, four,

01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:00.067
you better hide for sure.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:02.904
Five, six,

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:06.474
it's an evil trick.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.509
Seven, eight,

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:10.478
I'm full of hate.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:13.816
Nine, 10.

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:18.920
I'm your worst nightmare.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.041
Where you hiding at
you little fucker?

01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:43.878
Where you hiding
you little fucker?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.692
Where you hiding?

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.995
Come out, come out.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
This is a mess.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.936
I should clean it up.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.139
Her parents are gonna kill her.

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.274
Wait.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:15.910
I'm gonna kill her.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.950
Why waste the time?

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:36.265
Adventure camp, huh.

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:40.101
This, this is gonna
be an adventure.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.138
Maybe we should get
an award for tonight.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.977
Best revenge.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:57.718
I've got to find your brother.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.023
We'll have a game too.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.306
I'm gonna find you

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:21.008
and flay your flesh.

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:26.213
Come out, come out.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:42.597
You're gonna be mine.

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:45.700
You funny little clown ass.

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:48.769
Where the fuck are you hiding?

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:50.872
You're gonna be mine.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.075
You farty little clown ass.

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:57.979
Where are you hiding
you little fucker?

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:01.882
I know, I know where
all the kids hide.

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.262
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.101
Come out, come out.

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:47.796
Hello.

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:52.366
You're gonna die funny.

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.736
I want you to be funny.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:57.839
Get away from me.

01:20:01.531 --> 01:20:02.563
Yeah.

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:04.098
Yeah.

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:32.159
You're not working with me.

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:43.437
Oh yes, perfect.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:45.272
Very patriotic.

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:52.447
Perfect.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:22.877
This is my faith.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:25.379
This is my god.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:29.484
The desire

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:32.254
overwhelms me.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:36.223
Here, look at me.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.292
Mom always said share,

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:41.262
and here I'm supping
up the nectar of gods

01:21:41.264 --> 01:21:43.931
and not even
sharing with myself.

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.633
Okay, okay.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.010
Oh.

01:21:58.581 --> 01:21:59.581
The warmth.

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:04.251
Oh the sweet warmth.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.121
Why

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:08.255
can't I stop.

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:17.999
Euphoria.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:25.272
The twisted wrinkles in time.

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:28.009
Oh god.

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:29.977
It feels so much closer.

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:34.081
Okay, okay.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.450
There's a little bit left

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:37.618
that I can share with you.

01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:43.524
You're gonna get a little taste,

01:22:43.526 --> 01:22:46.527
a little taste of holy fire,

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:49.663
a little taste of Christ.

01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:00.407
Oh, it's so pretty, the crimson.

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:03.243
I know you want to taste my god.

01:23:03.245 --> 01:23:05.579
My god wants to own your soul.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.584
Wants to end your life.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:15.322
Don't worry you little fuck,

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.658
I got more.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.993
I got more and we're gonna
enjoy this journey together.

01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:43.517
I know

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.453
you will taste my god.

01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:51.558
My god wants to taste you.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.427
My god wants to own you.

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:57.364
My god wants to
own your soul, boy.

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:03.270
So here comes a taste
of mother's milk.

01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:23.258
Alex?

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.196
Have faith, you little fuck.

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:30.697
I have more.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:32.599
And you're gonna taste my god.

01:24:32.601 --> 01:24:34.535
You're gonna worship my god.

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:36.837
You will bow to him.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:41.375
You are gonna die

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:43.544
by my god.

01:24:46.115 --> 01:24:48.415
It's you who's gonna die.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.786
The fuck you say?

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:57.826
We'll see kid.

01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:01.228
The party's just begun.

01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:10.105
Alex?

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:55.616
What the fuck is going on?

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:00.854
This prank has gone on too far.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.589
I'm shooting his ass.

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:09.864
Come here.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.273
Hey little girl.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:24.811
Your brother, oh your brother
is such a piece of work.

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:26.513
He thought he
could hide from me.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:29.183
But he could never hide from me

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:31.485
cause I will always find you.

01:26:31.487 --> 01:26:32.920
You think you get away,

01:26:32.922 --> 01:26:35.389
but I'm in your head.

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:40.327
Now, now your brother's
escaping himself.

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:43.697
Oh, his mind is floating around

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.399
on a little journey

01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:46.600
as his skin tangles,

01:26:46.602 --> 01:26:48.502
and his blood burns.

01:26:49.572 --> 01:26:51.238
He's headed on a trip

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.307
he will not soon forget.

01:26:53.309 --> 01:26:55.809
A journey through
the depths of hell.

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:59.279
It will bring him to his end.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:01.648
But you, little girl,

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:05.352
you just couldn't
stop, could you?

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:08.755
You had to push my buttons.

01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:10.457
You just kept calling,

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:11.658
and calling,

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.960
and calling, and
calling, and calling.

01:27:12.962 --> 01:27:15.395
And I tried to stop it myself.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.663
I did.

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:18.665
I thought I could
maybe just end it.

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:21.568
But I couldn't even do that, no.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:26.540
But the fucking anger
burned in me so bright

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:29.810
I thought I know how

01:27:29.812 --> 01:27:32.312
I can end the torment.

01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:35.616
I could hunt you down one by one

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.518
and finish this little game.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:43.423
Yes, yes I figured out a way.

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:01.743
Ambiance.

01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:16.690
You thought this was for you?

01:28:23.032 --> 01:28:24.765
Oh no, too much air.

01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:26.700
Yes.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:29.770
This, this one's for me.

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:37.745
Oh.

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.091
Now we're ready.

01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:54.828
This will be nice.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:58.866
Perfect.

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:01.635
So pretty.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:35.669
Something bright.

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:42.810
Yeah.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:48.815
Good enough.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:57.424
You're gonna die beautiful.

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:01.928
No.

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.597
You're gonna die.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:05.900
What?

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:12.539
You think your heroine is a god?

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:24.852
Right here.

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:31.892
Right here, right
here, go ahead.

01:30:41.737 --> 01:30:43.003
You shouldn't play with guns.

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:46.773
You know, you're
really annoying.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:48.575
I should have
killed you earlier.

01:30:48.577 --> 01:30:51.511
But no, you're sister
wanted to play first.

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:55.749
Right here.

01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:56.950
Come on, no go ahead.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:58.852
Right here, right here.

01:31:03.859 --> 01:31:05.625
Stupid little boy.

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:07.093
You got to put bullets in it.

01:31:12.734 --> 01:31:13.667
I know that.

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:15.135
I only put in one bullet.

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:16.069
Well how about right here?

01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:17.571
Why if you want to take me out,

01:31:17.573 --> 01:31:19.005
well just shoot me in my heart.

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:20.740
Right in my heart, boy.

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:45.999
Do you feel lucky?

01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.551
Look at you dying.

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.152
Death is not a laughing matter.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.599
911, what's your emergency?

01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:22.636
There's a clown
that tried to kill us.

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:32.779
Alright, calm down.

01:32:32.781 --> 01:32:33.713
Where are you at?

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:36.016
We're in our house.

01:32:36.952 --> 01:32:38.685
Well where's the clown?

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:39.819
In our computer room.

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:41.621
We shot him.

01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:42.222
Okay.

01:32:42.224 --> 01:32:43.957
You shot him?

01:32:43.959 --> 01:32:44.992
What happened?

01:32:44.993 --> 01:32:46.026
I'm gonna get
those little fuckers.

01:32:46.028 --> 01:32:46.893
He tried to kill us,

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.962
and my brother shot him.

01:32:48.964 --> 01:32:51.064
Is he still moving?

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:52.032
No.

01:32:52.034 --> 01:32:53.867
A little, but I think he's dead.

01:32:53.869 --> 01:32:56.236
I can't believe that
little fucker shot me.

01:32:56.238 --> 01:33:00.106
Why would your
brother shoot the clown?

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:01.308
He was trying to kill us.

01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:04.945
You probably deserved it.

01:33:04.947 --> 01:33:05.946
What?

01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:07.647
Send the police.

01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:11.051
Are you sure he's dead?

01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:11.885
He should be.

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:13.353
He stopped laughing.

01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:16.990
Are you now in a safe location?

01:33:16.992 --> 01:33:17.992
Yes.

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:25.899
It is actually pretty funny

01:33:25.901 --> 01:33:27.934
when it's someone else.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:29.970
And now it's your turn.

01:33:31.974 --> 01:33:33.607
I bet you'd like to scream.

01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:35.909
I bet you think it's so funny.

01:33:35.911 --> 01:33:37.978
Well it's kind of
hard, isn't it?

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:39.980
Feeling a little weak?

01:33:54.997 --> 01:33:57.931
Hey, hey little buddy.

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:02.936
I can't believe a
little maggot like you

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:04.270
shot me.

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:07.808
You know what,

01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:11.044
death is not a
laughing matter, huh.

01:34:11.046 --> 01:34:13.680
Well, I say it is,

01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:16.282
especially when it's
happening to someone else.

01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:19.085
And I guess it's your
turn isn't it, sunny boy.

01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:23.356
Feeling pretty funny
now, aren't you?

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:25.091
Well why don't you scream?

01:34:25.093 --> 01:34:26.960
Why don't you yell out for help?

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:30.130
Oh that's right, you can't,

01:34:30.132 --> 01:34:32.766
cause I thought a
little blood letting

01:34:32.768 --> 01:34:34.167
might help you

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:37.237
out of your
delusional fantasies.

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:39.105
You want to play
games with a clown?
