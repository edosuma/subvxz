WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.769
My greatest pleasure
is giving my partner
his greatest pleasure,

00:03.771 --> 00:06.572
Which is why I keep
a bowl of ice next
to the bed.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.273
Well, that's terrific.

00:08.275 --> 00:11.310
Those are exactly
the kind of details
we need for this study.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.612
Thank you.
That's good stuff,
really good stuff.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.215
- As for me,
my greatest pleasure is--
- that's great, matt.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.519
You were saying
something about
how you use the ice...

00:20.521 --> 00:21.687
Okay, I think
we're done.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.089
Well, thank you,
tracy.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.557
You were terrific.
Thank you.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.026
- And matt.
- Yeah, him, too.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.531
- What a nice couple.
- Oh, please.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.600
The way you were slobbering
over that woman,

00:34.602 --> 00:36.602
It was beyond obvious.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.038
- What?
- Come on, just admit it.
She was hot.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.373
I know.
Smoking hot, right?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.809
What was she doing
with that roast beef sandwich
sitting next to her?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.677
Forget it, charlie.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.781
- You can't date her anyway.
She's in the study.
- I know that.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.083
Besides,
she's into shallow,
meaningless sex

00:51.085 --> 00:52.584
And that's not you.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.586
You want to find
that special someone

00:54.588 --> 00:56.622
And have
a real relationship
with her.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.424
Oh, that is so not true.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.125
That only applied to you.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.261
For reasons now
I can't seem to recall.

01:03.664 --> 01:08.667
In fact, I used to be
the west coast distributor
for shallow, meaningless sex.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.569
Yes, charlie, used to.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.738
But then your supply line
dried up.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.775
All that's left
in the warehouse was love.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.378
Hey, falling for you
was a fluke.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.480
The odds of any man
falling for you again

01:21.482 --> 01:22.781
Are astronomical.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.750
Thank you.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.252
No, wait.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.254
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.825
- No. Uh-uh.
- No?

01:32.827 --> 01:34.259
They weren't
the best I've seen.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.627
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.329
You guys just always
look great.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.664
Did you just get back
from the symphony?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.699
( scoffs )
the symphony?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.702
Symphony season
doesn't start for
another two months.

01:43.704 --> 01:44.870
( both laugh )

01:44.872 --> 01:47.573
Well, I'm glad
you got my joke.

01:47.575 --> 01:51.510
We just came back
from the opera la bohÃ¨me.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.513
- It was so beautiful.
- Well, not the soprano
who played mimi.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.116
A little hefty
to have tuberculosis,
if you ask me.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.851
- Oh, bad.
- ( laughing )

02:01.287 --> 02:03.422
Okay. Uh...

02:03.424 --> 02:04.723
You hens gonna have
your usual?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.558
- Yes, thank you.
- Mm.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.262
I'm on it.
Two ketel one martinis
for wayland and madame.

02:11.498 --> 02:12.798
Hey,
when you're done,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.834
Can I have a side of fries
and an ice cream sundae?

02:15.836 --> 02:18.137
And a side of fries...

02:18.139 --> 02:19.705
Oh, and some ice cream,
please?

02:21.407 --> 02:22.875
I recognize this.

02:22.877 --> 02:26.278
You're either stoned
or pregnant.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.514
Oh, my god.
I hope it's stoned.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.682
- ( laughs )
- oh, hey, patrick.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.418
Carol, this is nolan.
Nolan, this is good-bye.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.756
- I'll meet you at
that table right over--
- good, all right.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.692
I'm going to go
out on a limb

02:40.694 --> 02:44.630
And say that you enjoy
the marijuana.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.865
Well, you won't have
to go out very far.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.667
( laughs )

02:48.669 --> 02:50.669
I used to love to smoke.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.772
Really opens you up
to the music of the universe.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.742
- So you can
hear that, too?
- Uh-uh.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.378
It's kind of like
a polka, right?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.714
You smoke pot
and you're cute.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.783
Intriguing combination.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.920
Kind of like
french fries
and ice cream.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.621
Whoa!

03:09.623 --> 03:11.323
That's just what
I was gonna order.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.692
Whoa!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.427
It's insane!

03:15.429 --> 03:16.595
You read my mind.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.298
Well, it wasn't
"war and peace."

03:21.434 --> 03:25.571
Say, if you'd ever
like to go to the opera,

03:25.573 --> 03:27.439
I'd love to take you.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.674
The opera?

03:28.676 --> 03:30.375
I don't think
I'd enjoy that
very much.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.945
Oh, you would
if you were high.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.680
Wow.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.848
We just met and you know
so much about me.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.552
I don't want to have
a pool party

03:40.554 --> 03:42.454
Because then people
will see me in
my bathing suit.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.256
But I don't want to have
a bowling party

03:44.258 --> 03:46.692
Because no one will see me
in my bathing suit.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.794
Hey, I've got an idea
for your party.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.996
Your favorite birthday ever
was at chuck e. Cheese.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.664
She's 16, charlie.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.567
- She has a gynecologist.
- Mom!

03:55.569 --> 03:58.503
Well, we can invite him,
but he'll have to buy
his own tokens.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.607
Yeah, I bet
they'll be freezing cold.

04:01.609 --> 04:06.645
Don't worry, we're not
leaving here till we figure
this thing out, all right?

04:10.383 --> 04:11.850
Oh, hey.
Tracy, right?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.619
Charlie, hi.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.520
I was just gonna
call you guys.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.456
I'm really sorry
we can't be in
your study.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.424
Matt and I aren't
sleeping together
anymore.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.859
Oh, no,
that's terrible.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.628
I'm so sorry.
Can you give me
a minute?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.663
$500.
Anything you wanna do.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.765
I'll see you at home.
Happy birthday.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.668
Sorry about that.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.271
So what happened
with you guys?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.573
Matt wanted to go
beyond the friends
with benefits thing,

04:34.575 --> 04:37.509
But I'm not
looking for the kids
and the picket fence.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.578
I just want
really hot sex
with a good friend.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.680
Oh, my god, me, too.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.682
What a crazy coincidence.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.952
- Tracy?
- Let me get that for you.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.688
Here you go.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.725
So you're not
with anybody?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.594
For some reason,
I got the feeling that

04:55.596 --> 04:57.462
You and that kate woman
had something going on.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.698
Kate? God, no.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.534
We tried, but she was
way too clingy.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.004
You and I should get together.
Can I call you sometime?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.506
Oh, yeah.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.408
We'll grab dinner,
get to know each other,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.343
And whatever happens
happens.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.644
I'll tell you
what won't happen--

05:12.646 --> 05:15.647
- A relationship.
- ( laughs )

05:15.649 --> 05:18.583
- Here's to the people
who don't understand us.
- Screw them.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.320
We tried...
Didn't work out.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.388
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:29.662 --> 05:32.431
Hey.
Tracy, you look great.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.735
"no shirt, no shoes,
no service," that
includes pants.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.504
Didn't you get my text?

05:39.506 --> 05:43.108
Oh, my god.
Was I not supposed
to wear pants?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.677
No, I can't go out
to dinner.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.879
I'm supposed to be
out of the apartment
by noon tomorrow,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.781
But the movers cancelled
for the morning,

05:49.783 --> 05:51.683
So now I am gonna be
up all night

05:51.685 --> 05:54.353
Moving my stuff
to my new place.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.890
So...

05:58.892 --> 06:00.826
Being your new friend,
of course

06:00.828 --> 06:02.794
I'm gonna volunteer
to help you, aren't I?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.529
Oh, my god,
would you?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.431
I'd owe you big-time.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.699
Well, as long as
you've got a truck.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.701
Don't need one.
I just wanted a better view,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.603
So I got an apartment
six flights up.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.538
That's great.
That's great.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.775
Look at that.
You got the weight set
and everything.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.777
Are you sure
this is okay?
I feel bad.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.546
We're starting with
a lot more friends
than benefits.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.783
I mean, what kind of friend
would I be if I said no?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.086
I'm asking.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.692
I can't believe
you had the balls

06:33.694 --> 06:35.527
To call me
to help with this.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.829
I can't believe you came.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.966
You must really like
this girl

06:40.968 --> 06:43.435
To be moving her up
six flights.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.471
All I want is a friend
with benefits.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.774
And I don't wanna have
those benefits on the floor.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.075
Keep pulling.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.411
I don't get it.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.846
You had friends
with benefits with kate
and you let that go.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.515
No, no, no, no.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.017
She's the one who let it go
because I had feelings for her.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.520
Till she changes her mind
and decides she wants
a relationship,

07:01.522 --> 07:02.954
I'm just gonna have fun.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.756
( grunts )
oh!

07:04.758 --> 07:06.191
I'm glad
you're having fun

07:06.193 --> 07:09.161
Because something
just popped in my groin.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.062
Oh, this is very heavy!

07:11.064 --> 07:13.932
Sorry, sorry.
Let's just set it here
on the rail for a second.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.067
- ( both groan )
- there we go.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.970
<i>( mattress banging )</i>

07:22.208 --> 07:25.043
You think
we would've learned that
from the first time.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.913
Oh, good,
you didn't bring up
the mattress yet.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.214
We still have to paint.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.017
Way ahead of you.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.520
( both laughing )

07:41.561 --> 07:44.563
- What are we laughing at?
- I don't--

07:46.032 --> 07:49.468
I don't know,
but it's funny.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.771
Oh, oh, oh.
Now, what did you
think of the opera?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.072
I know
I asked you before,

07:54.074 --> 07:56.842
But I don't remember
what you said.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.911
I used to think cartoons
hit all the highs and lows

07:59.913 --> 08:01.880
- Of human emotions...
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.983
...But after
seeing rigoletto
stab his daughter,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.985
This "aqua teen hunger force"

08:06.987 --> 08:10.589
Seems almost mundane.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.224
I know,
and I'm having

08:12.226 --> 08:14.893
Such a good time
with you.

08:14.895 --> 08:19.764
And I had forgotten
how wonderful pot is.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.834
- That's why
I smoke so much.
- Oh.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.537
- So I'll never forget.
- ( laughs )

08:25.539 --> 08:28.874
Everything is better
when you're high.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.176
Cartoons are better
when you're high.

08:31.178 --> 08:35.146
Your husband's funeral
is better when you're high.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.950
- You know what's not
better when you're high?
- What?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.585
Nothing.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.654
Oh!
( laughs )

08:42.656 --> 08:45.991
Oh, you're cute.
Mm.

08:45.993 --> 08:49.528
Yeah, I'm cuter
when you're high.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.906
( laughs )

09:04.644 --> 09:06.611
Tracy:
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for helping me.</i>

09:06.613 --> 09:07.979
I know it was
a lot of painting

09:07.981 --> 09:09.748
And you had to move
all that furniture,

09:09.750 --> 09:12.817
But look at that view
from up here.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.888
Yeah, look.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.623
The freeway
is so much smaller.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.726
All the people down there
look like...

09:21.728 --> 09:23.628
Slightly smaller people.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.066
Come on.
It was worth it, right?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.801
Oh, yeah.
Before I looked out
the window,

09:29.803 --> 09:32.938
I thought I'd compressed
three vertebrae for nothing.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.973
Oh, no.
You got paint
on your shirt.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.108
Maybe we should
take it off.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.679
Whoops.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.581
Paint on my pants.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.616
Oh, that's too bad.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.019
That's okay.
They're just my old
painting and sex pants.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.126
( sighs )
well-done, buddy.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.063
Hey, I came
to play, pal.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.001
You know what the best part
of our friendship is?

10:03.003 --> 10:06.237
That thing you do
with the ice?

10:06.239 --> 10:09.307
No, now I have someone
to take me to my cousin's
wedding next week.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.009
Since I broke it off
with matt,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.944
I have no one to go with.
Wanna come?

10:12.946 --> 10:15.213
To a wedding?
Isn't that something
couples do?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.148
Oh, my god, charlie.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.618
I just wanna get drunk,
dance, and doink.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.786
Are you coming
with me or not?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.356
Well, if it's a dance
and doink kind of wedding,
I'm in.

10:25.858 --> 10:28.760
Awesome.
Do you have a tie
that goes with lavender?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.962
Uh... Not sure, why?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.864
'cause we have to match.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.699
Right.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.736
'cause friends
always have to match.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.942
Hey, patrick,

10:43.944 --> 10:45.810
Thanks for taking up
three spots

10:45.812 --> 10:48.013
With your
nissan "assfinder."

10:48.015 --> 10:51.049
Mister,
I am not in the mood.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.684
( chuckles )

10:52.686 --> 10:55.353
I'll bet you can't remember
the last time you said that.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.891
Charlie just texted.
He's running late.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.694
So let's just start
the stupid session
without him.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.030
I can sound like a shrink,
so I'll run this.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.234
Okay, patrick,

11:09.236 --> 11:12.237
Why are you
on the man rag?

11:12.239 --> 11:14.072
Well,
under the category

11:14.074 --> 11:17.008
Of things that none of you
could possibly understand,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.778
I can't figure out why,
after six years,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.279
My friend carol
has suddenly

11:21.281 --> 11:22.814
Stopped inviting me
to the opera.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.750
Maybe she got
to know you.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.153
This is fun.
Okay, nolan?

11:29.822 --> 11:31.990
Can't be that
she doesn't like opera,

11:31.992 --> 11:33.925
'cause she's been
going with me.

11:33.927 --> 11:38.096
You?
What could you possibly
offer her that I can't?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.800
Oh, my god,
you're sleeping with her.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.835
How did you know?

11:43.837 --> 11:45.870
'cause you're grinning
like the cat that ate

11:45.872 --> 11:48.973
The very, very old canary.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.776
Well, I think it's great.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.945
Older men sleep
with younger women
all the time

11:53.947 --> 11:56.715
And nobody says dick.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.116
How old is she, nolan?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.085
73.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.921
Oh, my god.
I wanna vomit.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.824
Son, what is wrong
with you?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.926
Having sex
with an old woman

12:07.928 --> 12:09.494
Is like doing your taxes.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.397
You put it off
until you absolutely
have to.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.266
Forget the age thing.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.135
Doesn't anybody here
see that nolan

12:17.137 --> 12:19.838
Stole one of my
very best friends?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.973
Hey, we have
a good time together.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.843
And if you're really
her friend, you'd be happy
that she's happy.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.846
You keep your stoner boner
away from her.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.814
I will not.
I like her.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.316
And I'm gonna keep
seeing her, patrick.

12:31.318 --> 12:34.018
Wow.
A breakthrough.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.489
I am so much better at this
than charlie.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.758
Muffin break.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.196
So, wayne,
why do you feel like
this other prisoner,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.866
Ronnie "the butcher,"

12:47.868 --> 12:49.167
Let you down?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.936
'cause I thought
he was my friend.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.872
But he went
and escaped
without me.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.107
No call or nothing.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.476
But you said he was killed
by the guards trying to
get over the fence.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.779
That's not the point.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.914
I don't even
wanna escape.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.984
It's just nice
to be invited.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.886
Well, sometimes,
people have different
interpretations

13:07.888 --> 13:09.921
Of what a friendship is.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.391
One person may see it
as a casual friendship

13:13.393 --> 13:16.060
And another person may see it
as something more.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.096
Has that ever
happened to you,
charlie?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.964
Well, actually,
I'm in a relationship
right now

13:19.966 --> 13:21.900
Where there are
certain ambiguities,

13:21.902 --> 13:24.035
But we don't have time
to get into all that.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.105
Charlie, we're not
going anywhere.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.476
I'm supposed to be
in a friends-with-benefits
relationship

13:31.478 --> 13:34.045
Where there's
no emotional investment
and it's purely sexual.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.514
Oh, yeah.
We got that
in prison, too.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.884
It's called
"enemies with benefits."

13:41.821 --> 13:43.421
The point is that's all
I want right now,

13:43.423 --> 13:45.156
But I'm starting to think
that this woman feels

13:45.158 --> 13:46.858
That it's something more
than that.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.459
What's that
supposed to mean,
charlie?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.028
She invited me
to her cousin's wedding

13:50.030 --> 13:51.830
And she wants to coordinate
our outfits.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.065
Ooh! I have a test
to determine your status.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.867
You mean, kill her
and then see if the cops

13:55.869 --> 13:57.936
Call it
a crime of passion?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.304
No.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.972
When you walk
into the wedding,

14:00.974 --> 14:02.907
If she takes your hand,
you're a couple.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.844
If she puts her hand
on your shoulder,
you're not.

14:05.846 --> 14:09.047
And if she puts
her hand in your wallet,
she robbing you.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.349
You kids.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.918
In my day, your best gal
just wore your ring.

14:16.188 --> 14:20.158
Boy, you sure know
a lot of different
positions.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.526
( giggles )

14:21.528 --> 14:25.129
Have you ever heard
of the "kama sutra"?

14:25.131 --> 14:27.031
No.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.934
Is that one of those
expressions from
your generation?

14:29.936 --> 14:33.371
Like the "cat's pajamas"
or "grease is the word"?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.539
No.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.941
It's an ancient book

14:36.943 --> 14:39.577
With a lot of
sexual positions.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.046
Well, don't tell me
how it ends.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.915
Ooh.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.020
Did you like
this evening's opera?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.555
I guess.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.625
Isn't there one
where somebody
doesn't die?

14:53.627 --> 14:56.995
Hmm. Most of them
are tragedies.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.931
No, I mean,
in the audience.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.599
( laughs )

15:01.601 --> 15:05.169
Well, opera's
not very popular
with young people,

15:05.171 --> 15:07.105
But patrick
seems to like it.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.141
I've been taking him
since his mom passed.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.644
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Mm.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.079
So you guys
are pretty close?

15:15.081 --> 15:17.015
Yes.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.285
Matter of fact,
I think I owe him a call.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.453
It's been
a couple of days.

15:22.455 --> 15:26.090
Or three weeks.
I can't remember.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.693
Oh, you're cute.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.262
( laughs )

15:31.264 --> 15:33.197
What are you thinking?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.366
Nothing, uh...

15:35.368 --> 15:37.335
Tell me more
about the '70s.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.137
Oh! Well,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.673
Huge amounts of drugs,

15:41.675 --> 15:44.108
Sexual experimentation,

15:44.110 --> 15:47.278
And a lot of
going around braless.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.348
I was talking about
being in your 70s.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.051
Well, so was I.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.492
- Well, that was
a beautiful ceremony.
- Yeah.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.262
- So do you want
to get a drink?
- Sure.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.297
Let me escort you
to the bar.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.366
Hold any place
you'd like.

16:11.003 --> 16:14.005
Oh, the elbow.
That's ambiguous.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.175
Oh, my god!
It's charlie!

16:17.177 --> 16:19.143
You brought charlie.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.279
So glad you can
make it, charlie.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.482
How does she
know my name?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.485
I just posted
some pictures of us
on facebook.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.753
We took pictures?

16:28.755 --> 16:30.755
No, I photoshopped
some stuff together.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.657
I do that
with all my friends.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.126
Oh, well,
that's... Fun.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.261
Daddy, over here.

16:37.263 --> 16:40.365
Hi, sweetheart.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.467
And you must be charlie.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.736
We've heard so much
about you.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.537
Well, thank you
very much, mr.--

16:46.539 --> 16:48.473
I don't know
your last name.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.109
Now I know you
just started dating
my little girl,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.611
But she seems to think
you're something special.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.346
Dad,
you're embarrassing me.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.248
We're just friends
and we're having some fun.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.783
It's not like
we're getting married.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.019
( gasps )
oh, my god, they're
throwing the bouquet!

17:02.421 --> 17:04.756
<i>( women screaming,</i>
<i>applauding )</i>

17:04.758 --> 17:07.759
How 'bout that?
She dove for it.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.532
- What do you think,
charlie?
- Oh!

17:14.534 --> 17:16.667
Scary, right?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.370
I borrowed it
from the bride.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.739
You may kiss the bride.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.442
Kidding. You may kiss
the friend in a veil.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.111
Actually, I'd rather
talk right now.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.746
Tracy, I'm afraid
you might be in denial

17:28.748 --> 17:30.515
About what
you really want.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.583
Oh, so serious.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.553
I think somebody
needs to doink in
the coatroom.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.589
Let's put that
in our back pocket

17:38.591 --> 17:40.358
And see how you feel
after I tell you about

17:40.360 --> 17:42.460
The crazy stuff I think's
going on in your head.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.395
What are you
talking about?

17:48.801 --> 17:52.103
What you call
friends with benefits,

17:52.105 --> 17:54.772
Most people would call
a relationship.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.608
A committed,
long-term,

17:57.610 --> 17:59.210
High-maintenance,

17:59.212 --> 18:01.279
Color-coordinated
relationship.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.514
You sound
just like matt.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.350
Every time we would go
to the maternity ward
to look at babies,

18:06.352 --> 18:09.120
He'd think I wanted
a relationship.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.289
Well,
maybe he was right.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.790
What are you
trying to say?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.259
That I was in love
with matt?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.261
Yes, actually.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.197
And you probably
still are.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.499
I'm just
a substitute matt.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.701
If matt was chocolate,
I'd be carob.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.436
If matt was milk,
I'd be soy.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.538
- If matt was butter,
I'd be...
- I get it.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.640
..."I can't believe
it's not matt."

18:29.642 --> 18:33.311
Sorry, that was
my big finish.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.146
Hmm, maybe you're right.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.381
That must be why
I've had to fake
all my orgasms with you.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.584
Exactly.
I mean, what?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.519
I mean, yes.
That's right.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.221
There can be
no other explanation.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.523
- Wow.
- You're in love
with matt.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.358
Nobody else in the world
can satisfy you.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.663
- Not one?
- No.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.500
All right, then,
me, neither.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.239
<i>( cell phone chimes )</i>

19:02.508 --> 19:03.875
Oh, wow.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.746
I'd like some ice cream
and french fries, please.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.816
We're all out, smokey.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.652
How 'bout some ice cream
and french fries?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.522
Oh, my god.
That sounds great.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.591
Hey, nolan.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.627
Oh, hey, patrick.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.695
I was gonna call you.

19:24.697 --> 19:28.332
I got some sad news.
Carol dumped me.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.935
Now she'll have
plenty of time to go
to the opera with you.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.371
Really,
she dumped you, huh?

19:33.373 --> 19:34.438
Why?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.240
Why?

19:36.242 --> 19:39.477
Oh, she wanted to do
some stuff I wasn't
comfortable with.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.611
Like what?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.812
I'm a gentleman.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.848
I don't spank and tell.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.185
Thank you for being
so discreet.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.655
And thank you
for breaking up with her.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.890
Where'd you get
that idea?

19:54.660 --> 19:55.960
Ah, dang!

19:55.962 --> 19:58.563
I never should have
taught her how to text.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.531
Although she did
teach me how to turn

20:00.533 --> 20:02.767
A blood pressure machine
into a vaporizer.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.437
Hey, I forgot
to tell you.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.806
I got an e-mail
from tracy and matt

20:08.808 --> 20:11.776
And they got back together
and they still want to be
in the study.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.478
I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.314
Why?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.648
Is it a conflict
of interest?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.784
A little bit.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.920
Oh, no.
Charlie, did you
have sex with matt?

20:24.723 --> 20:27.592
No, but I had
a wonderful time
with tracy.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.493
But, unfortunately,
I had to end it.

20:29.495 --> 20:30.995
Why?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.997
Did you realize
you were getting all
gushy and lovey-dovey

20:32.999 --> 20:34.932
And it freaked you out?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.667
Yes, kate,
that's exactly
what happened

20:36.669 --> 20:39.503
On planet
other-way-around.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.373
Oh, you mean
opposite world.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.508
Yeah, if you're five.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.877
Granted,
it was only
three days,

20:46.879 --> 20:49.513
But it was a very successful
friends-with-benefits
relationship.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.649
Oh, was it?

20:51.651 --> 20:56.354
I managed to move her
into her new apartment,
paint it,

20:56.356 --> 20:59.323
Go to a wedding
in matching outfits
where I met her parents

20:59.325 --> 21:01.559
And watched her
catch the bouquet.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.494
You're not
very good at this.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.529
Have you ever
played chess before?

21:05.531 --> 21:07.665
Not once.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.700
Was the sex any good?

21:09.702 --> 21:11.736
Just for me.
