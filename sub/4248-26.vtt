- I AM NOT SCARED OF YOU GUYS.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.179
- WE WERE THINKING MORE
ABOUT RUFUS.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.973
- HIM I'M SCARED OF.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.810
- SO I'VE DESIGNED THIS TO PUT
ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.645
- WOW, MARA, IT'S SO COOL.

12:09.728 --> 12:13.149
- SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO GET,
LIKE, ALL DRESSED UP?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.484
- YES!

12:15.568 --> 12:16.819
THIS IS OUR PROM.

12:16.902 --> 12:20.322
I'M TALKING PUNCH, TUXEDOS,
AND PROPER DANCING,

12:20.406 --> 12:21.490
NONE OF THAT AWKWARD

12:21.574 --> 12:24.118
FOOT-SHUFFLE, HEAD-BOB THING
YOU USUALLY DO.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.413
- [giggling]

12:27.496 --> 12:28.873
- YOU HAVE TO REALLY DANCE.

12:37.631 --> 12:42.136
[laughter]

12:42.219 --> 12:44.805
- SO BASICALLY, YOU SOLD
YOUR FRIENDS OUT FOR MONEY.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.641
- FRIENDS?
YOU ARE NOT MY FRIENDS.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.852
YOU'VE MADE THAT QUITE CLEAR.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
- LISTEN, IF RUFUS GETS
HIS HANDS ON THOSE PIECES,

12:51.687 --> 12:54.148
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.359
- WORLD DOMINATION.
THE MAN'S A CONTROL FREAK.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.153
- YOU HAVE TO WORK
WITH US HERE, JEROME.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.864
- WHAT IS SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THESE THINGS?

13:01.947 --> 13:05.034
RUFUS TOLD ME HE WAS LOOKING
FOR TREASURE,

13:05.117 --> 13:08.245
AN EGYPTIAN CUP OR SOMETHING.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.497
- [sighs]

13:09.580 --> 13:11.207
- WHAT?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.377
- I'M JUST NOT GOOD
AT THAT KIND OF DANCING.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.713
OR ANY KIND, REALLY.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.508
- I CAN TEACH YOU,
IF YOU LIKE.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.550
- HMM?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.387
- OH, ONLY IF IT'S COOL
WITH YOU, MARA.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.307
- SURE, YEAH.
WHY NOT?

13:28.390 --> 13:31.560
I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH IT.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.729
- WHEW!
SORRY I'M LATE.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.649
BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL
USED THE TIME WISELY,

13:36.732 --> 13:40.277
TO PLAN YOUR HOMEWORK,
YOUR FURTHER EDUCATION,

13:40.361 --> 13:43.614
AND YOUR GLITTERING CAREERS
IN GOVERNMENT.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.867
[bell ringing]

13:46.951 --> 13:49.078
- JEROME, WAIT UP!

13:49.161 --> 13:50.913
- LOOK, ARE YOU
GOING TO HELP US OR NOT?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.748
- WHO'S TO SAY
THAT I WOULDN'T BE BETTER OFF

13:52.831 --> 13:53.499
STICKING TO MY ORIGINAL PLAN?

13:53.582 --> 13:54.500
- WHAT IS THAT THEN?

13:54.583 --> 13:57.503
- GIVING RUFUS WHAT HE WANTS.

13:57.586 --> 14:00.548
THAT WAY,
I GET HIM OFF MY BACK.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.676
I STAY ALIVE,
AND I GET RICH.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.844
- YOU DO THAT,
AND WE'LL TELL THE TEACHERS.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
- THE TEACHERS?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.222
WHAT HAVE THEY
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

14:08.305 --> 14:09.557
- EVERYTHING.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.767
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE
VERY HAPPY TO LEARN

14:11.850 --> 14:14.937
THAT YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING THEIR
ARCHENEMY VITAL INFORMATION.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.147
- WE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER,
DUDE.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.818
IT'S SAFER.
TRUST ME.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.737
- ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.656
- YEAH.
RIGHT.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.326
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS--
ALFIE?

14:29.410 --> 14:32.204
- UH...FABIAN?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.790
- NOPE.

14:34.873 --> 14:35.666
- I HAVE A PLAN.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.376
- I'M GLAD ONE OF YOU DOES.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.254
[phone ringing]

14:40.337 --> 14:42.548
I HAVE THE PUZZLE PIECES
FOR YOU.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.550
- FINALLY SOME GOOD NEWS.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.634
I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE USUAL PLACE.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.137
- NO, NO, NO,
IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.055
- IN WHAT WAY?

14:50.139 --> 14:51.265
- THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.560
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,
BUT I NEED SOME HELP.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.936
- WHY?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.938
- BECAUSE I CAN'T GET
INTO THE SECRET HIDING PLACE

14:58.022 --> 14:59.023
BY MYSELF.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.108
VICTOR, VICTOR IS OUT
FOR THE NIGHT,

15:01.191 --> 15:04.153
SO I WILL SNEAK DOWN
AND UNLOCK THE FRONT DOOR

15:04.236 --> 15:04.987
AFTER LIGHTS-OUT.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL BE IN BED.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.242
OH, AND BRING THE OTHER PIECE
WITH YOU.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.578
- WHY?

15:12.661 --> 15:16.373
- BECAUSE YOU NEED IT TO GET
INTO THE SECRET HIDING PLACE.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.168
- HOW MANY PIECES ARE THERE?

15:19.251 --> 15:21.170
- SEVEN.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.296
- I KNEW IT.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.673
- SO I'LL MEET YOU TONIGHT,
YEAH?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.300
MIDNIGHT?

15:26.383 --> 15:29.094
- MIDNIGHT.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.228
- YOU DID SO WELL.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.315
AND YOU DIDN'T PEE YOUR PANTS,
SO BONUS.

15:48.989 --> 15:49.740
- IT'S 10:00!

15:49.823 --> 15:51.867
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.703
HURRY, BOY.
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.207
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY,

15:58.290 --> 16:04.463
AND THEN I SHALL WANT TO HEAR
A PIN DROP.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.090
[pin clinking]

16:40.457 --> 16:42.209
- DOH!

16:42.292 --> 16:44.294
- [whispering]
WHERE ARE THEY?

16:44.378 --> 16:47.214
- [whispering]
IN THE CELLAR.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.716
- THAT ISN'T THE WAY
TO THE CELLAR.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.009
- ISN'T IT?

17:00.936 --> 17:01.562
I'LL NEED THE PUZZLE PIECE.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.564
- WHAT FOR?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.452
INTRIGUING.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.412
AFTER YOU.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.140
- JEROME WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO
DOWN THERE WITH HIM.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.018
- I CAN'T LOCK THEM BOTH
IN THERE.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.269
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.980
DO WE HAVE TO GO GET VICTOR YET?

17:45.063 --> 17:47.274
- WHERE'S JEROME?

17:47.357 --> 17:49.151
NO.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.152
NO, THIS IS BAD.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.361
THIS IS VERY BAD!

17:51.445 --> 17:53.280
- IT WAS SUCH A SIMPLE PLAN.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.865
GET THE PUZZLE PIECE OFF RUFUS,

17:54.948 --> 17:56.283
LOCK HIM IN THE CELLAR,
GET VICTOR.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.826
- WHEN RUFUS REALIZES THERE ARE
NO PUZZLE PIECES DOWN THERE,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.286
HE'S GONNA MUMMIFY JEROME.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.257
- ARE WE STILL TRYING
WITH THE ELIXIR, VICTOR?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.134
[chuckles]

18:27.147 --> 18:30.192
- OKAY, GUYS, I SAY
WE CARRY ON WITH THE PLAN

18:30.275 --> 18:33.529
AS IF IT'S JUST RUFUS
DOWN THERE.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.197
ALFIE, YOU GO AND SLAM THE DOOR.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.157
AMBER, PATRICIA, YOU GO UPSTAIRS
AND ALERT VICTOR.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.910
NINA, YOU HIDE
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.955
IF JEROME COMES OUT AND YOU GET
A CHANCE TO LOCK RUFUS IN THERE,

18:43.038 --> 18:45.541
DO IT.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.876
SIBUNA?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.336
all: SIBUNA.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.220
- OKAY, YOU TWO, UPSTAIRS.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.942
- YES.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.027
YES!

19:18.866 --> 19:21.660
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:21.743 --> 19:24.705
AND WHERE ARE THE ANKH PIECES?

19:26.582 --> 19:27.708
WELL?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.169
[door slams]

19:33.005 --> 19:34.173
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- VICTOR!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.591
HE MUST BE BACK.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.593
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- LISTEN, I'LL GO UP THERE.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.177
I'LL STOP HIM COMING DOWN
INTO THE CELLAR.

19:39.261 --> 19:39.970
- NO, NO, NO,
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.306
- BUT WHAT IF HE COMES BACK?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.724
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

19:49.271 --> 19:50.939
- UM, WE THINK SOMEONE
MIGHT HAVE BROKEN IN.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.192
- THE NOISE CAME
FROM THE CELLAR.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.486
WE'RE SO VERY SCARED.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.779
- I'LL GO AND SEE.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.764
WHO'S THERE?

20:46.995 --> 20:47.704
- HELLO, VICTOR.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.164
- COME ON, JEROME.

20:49.247 --> 20:54.419
I DON'T WANT TO LOCK YOU
IN THERE TOO.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.756
- SORRY, I CAN'T STAY,
BUT THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.841
- NO!

21:02.010 --> 21:04.096
- NO!
- [shrieks]

21:04.179 --> 21:07.307
- LOCK HIM IN!
LOCK HIM IN!

21:07.391 --> 21:10.060
- [screams]
