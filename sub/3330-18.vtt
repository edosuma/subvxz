00:04.738 --> 00:06.505
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:10.743
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.578
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.580 --> 00:15.180
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.616
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:20.019
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.721
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

00:22.723 --> 00:24.656
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:26.492
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.660
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:31.196
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.365
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.701
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:38.404
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.406 --> 00:40.372
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:43.375
(news theme playing)

00:45.311 --> 00:47.679
The tranquil landscapes
often praised here in belarus

00:47.681 --> 00:51.083
May soon give way to rolling
tanks and blasting mortars

00:51.085 --> 00:53.786
As the century-long
border conflict with neighbors

00:53.788 --> 00:56.789
<i>Lithuania and latvia</i>
<i>has reignited.</i>

00:56.791 --> 00:59.324
With each nation being pledged
military support

00:59.326 --> 01:04.096
By respective allies,
russia, china, poland, germany,

01:04.098 --> 01:07.099
And the u.S.,
geopolitical experts fear

01:07.101 --> 01:09.435
If a resolution
is not reached quickly,

01:09.437 --> 01:12.404
All these countries
may soon be at war.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.405
Flight 5-19,

01:13.407 --> 01:15.808
Lax runway bravo is clear.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.410
Wind's one niner niner at two.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.712
Permission to land.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.751
Got an unregistered bogey, sir.

01:27.187 --> 01:30.189
It's only 500 feet
below a 747 heading eastbound.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.459
Establish contact immediately.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.194
The hell?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.795
It just... Vanished.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.497
Sylvester:
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>

01:38.499 --> 01:40.232
I just committed
at least three felonies.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.700
And I've seen <i>shawshank.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:44.570
I know what they do to guys
like me in the big house.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.871
D block prom queen.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.706
That's it? It's gone?
It's still there.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.410
So it blends in with the
background of the atc monitor.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.644
Basically,
I made it disappear.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.848
That's lithuanian for
"sayonara," which is japanese

01:55.850 --> 01:57.282
For "good-bye."

01:57.284 --> 01:58.750
That plane will be
effectively invisible

01:58.752 --> 02:00.419
When it lands
at your private airstrip.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.488
I am still feeling
very uncomfortable with this.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.555
It's deceptive.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.190
Merrick:
Tensions are extremely high.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.392
If the world knew that the
leaders from belarus, lithuania,

02:07.394 --> 02:09.661
And latvia were flying
to the u.S.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.197
And no treaty was reached,
it could tip the entire region

02:12.199 --> 02:13.832
Over the edge.
I understand.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.834
But historically, when
governments try to hide facts

02:15.836 --> 02:18.770
From citizenry,
everyone winds up in hot water.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.810
(engine revving in distance)

02:37.323 --> 02:38.590
Paige:
Oh.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.859
You're still playing
with your toy?

02:40.861 --> 02:44.396
This toy is three-dimensional

02:44.398 --> 02:46.398
Viz-surround
software technology.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.633
Oh, it's-it's green screen.

02:47.635 --> 02:51.470
Wrong. It can be used
on a green screen,

02:51.472 --> 02:54.406
But my software allows you
to take various images

02:54.408 --> 02:57.609
From different sources
and layer them seamlessly

02:57.611 --> 02:59.211
On top of each other.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.712
Like colorforms.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.914
The kids' toy.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.383
I didn't play with
kids' toys. Anyway,

03:04.385 --> 03:05.918
Even fbi video forensics

03:05.920 --> 03:08.253
Couldn't detect these images
as fake.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.322
They're groundbreaking.
Good. Because

03:10.324 --> 03:11.790
You're gonna need to fool a lot
of people today.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.592
Oh, it will.
So, speaking of today,

03:13.594 --> 03:14.760
Did you see my analysis report?

03:14.762 --> 03:16.828
Uh, yeah.
Okay. I know what you're doing,

03:16.830 --> 03:19.531
So let me be more specific.
Did you read my report?

03:20.900 --> 03:22.768
Come on. 25 pages

03:22.770 --> 03:24.770
Detailing the customs and
history of the three countries

03:24.772 --> 03:25.871
Who are meeting today.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.539
It's important.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.942
I understand.
But, uh, so is this,

03:29.944 --> 03:31.610
And I just didn't
get around to it.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.945
Uh, why did you write it anyway?

03:32.947 --> 03:35.781
I never asked you to.
Well, truth is,

03:35.783 --> 03:38.517
I'm taking night classes.
One's on european history.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.720
Had a paper due. We had this
case coming up, so, you know,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.555
I figured two birds,
one stone.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.924
You dropped out of college.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.361
I re-enrolled
to finish my degree, yeah.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.562
Uh-huh. Why?
To learn,

03:50.564 --> 03:51.897
For the betterment
of myself,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.266
And to set a good example
for ralph.
I get that.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.268
It's great
that you're pursuing education,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.804
But why european history?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.240
Liberal arts
are complete nonsense.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.908
Oh, I couldn't disagree more.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.977
The information that you receive
is strictly dependent

04:04.979 --> 04:08.547
On the beliefs of whoever
authored the textbooks.

04:08.549 --> 04:12.451
There are only four subjects
worth studying: Science and math

04:12.453 --> 04:13.919
And math and science.
Okay,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.989
So when you meet the lithuanian
president, what will you do?

04:16.991 --> 04:19.925
I'll say hello
and shake his hand.
Mm-hmm.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.827
And that could be disastrous
because when you shake the hands

04:21.829 --> 04:23.962
Of a lithuanian in the
threshold of a room,

04:23.964 --> 04:25.864
It's considered insulting.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.734
If the fate of civilization
rests on where we shake hands

04:28.736 --> 04:31.803
With these people,
then we're all doomed.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.979
(horses neighing over video)

04:43.916 --> 04:46.318
Hey, hopalong.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.953
We're about to hop along,
so why don't you stop

04:47.955 --> 04:50.856
Watching that movie
for the 12th time?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.858
This movie was filmed
on the senator's compound

04:52.860 --> 04:54.826
Where the summit's taking place.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.728
I'm studying the layout
of the grounds

04:56.730 --> 04:59.064
'cause some of the sets are
still standing on the property.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.066
You already walked the
ground with homeland.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.968
You're a fanboy.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.572
Next time, let your horse do
the thinking.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.508
He's smarter.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.544
They don't make classics
like this anymore.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.480
Fanboy.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.417
Hey, you got
a second?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.551
What are you doing?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.552
With what?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.720
Hand, back.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.588
Yours, mine.
Oh.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.824
Sorry, I didn't
even notice.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.560
Happy: Yesterday, you brushed
a leaf from my hair,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.362
And on Tuesday
you laughed hysterically

05:30.364 --> 05:31.630
At something I said.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.898
How do you know
it wasn't funny?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.466
I was reading a menu.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.468
Pupu platter?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.371
I can't help but feel
something's changed.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.872
Are you referring to our kiss?
Don't...

05:40.874 --> 05:41.973
Say it.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.542
(whispers):
Kiss.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.677
Almost kiss.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.847
It didn't happen.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.851
Yet.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.920
(helicopter whirring)

06:04.831 --> 06:06.832
Cabe:
That's lithuanian president

06:06.834 --> 06:10.936
Dmitri kreshenko and
his chief advisor mikko aleska.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.105
Merrick: Over there is
belarus president

06:13.107 --> 06:14.406
Boris sakovich

06:14.408 --> 06:15.974
And his entourage,

06:15.976 --> 06:19.778
And finally
latvian president juris nikonov.

06:19.780 --> 06:24.383
Their president's more
of a figurehead.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.685
You didn't read
my report either.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.553
All right,
let's get to work.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.855
Woman:
Director merrick.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.490
Ah, ms. Munoz.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.824
Cabe, this is
renÃ© munoz,

06:32.826 --> 06:34.793
Assistant secretary,
state department.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.095
Since there's a good chance
that things could become

06:37.097 --> 06:38.397
Tense over the next few days...

06:38.399 --> 06:39.798
I'm here to
keep these guys

06:39.800 --> 06:42.134
Away from each other's throats
and at the bargaining table.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.969
Great. Right now we need
to get these men in front

06:43.971 --> 06:46.004
Of the green screens and
make it look like they're back

06:46.006 --> 06:47.606
In their home countries
and not here.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.574
Anything gets lost
in translation,

06:49.576 --> 06:50.475
We'll reach out.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.843
Understood.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.780
Paige:
Excuse me. RenÃ©.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.948
Uh, I wrote a report
on the historical customs

06:56.950 --> 06:59.885
And traditions of these nations,
if this could be of any help.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.486
Uh, thanks.
I'll refer to it

07:01.488 --> 07:02.721
If I get in a jam.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.045
Okay, cut!

07:27.047 --> 07:28.914
What the hell
is he doing?

07:29.615 --> 07:30.916
What are you typing?

07:30.918 --> 07:33.885
Nothing. I'm pretending.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.154
An eight-year-old
with a dvr can slo-mo this

07:36.156 --> 07:37.889
And see every
keystroke.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.191
If this does not
read as real,

07:39.193 --> 07:41.993
Then all of it
was a waste of time.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.495
So can you please stop
pretending

07:43.497 --> 07:44.729
And actually type something?

07:44.731 --> 07:46.531
Thank you, sir.
Walter, you just need to...

07:46.533 --> 07:48.934
Mr. President, you can type
whatever you'd like. We'll just

07:48.936 --> 07:50.869
Raise the camera an inch
so no one sees your fingers.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.504
Is that acceptable?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.072
Thank you, sir.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.508
Okay.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.477
What was that?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.479
He was doing it wrong.
And over the next few days,

08:00.481 --> 08:02.147
We'll need to make a half
dozen of these videos,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.783
So I need to nip
bad habits in the bud.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.952
Me, too.
So I'll be clear.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.787
You do not talk to a president
like that.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.726
And, you, you do not
talk to a president at all.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.661
I was just trying to help.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.063
Want to help?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.965
Stay on the sidelines.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.671
(clock ticking)

08:29.675 --> 08:32.978
Is it just me, or does this feel
like a seventh grade dance?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.746
I didn't go
to the seventh grade dance.

08:34.748 --> 08:38.016
Me neither, but I imagine
this is what it was like.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.685
Typical.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.288
We sit here in silence
while neither of you are willing

08:43.290 --> 08:45.524
To extend
the first olive branch.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.259
We have all traveled
the same distance.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.960
I do not hear
you making offers.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.262
This summit was my idea.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.263
That is my offer.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.131
I suggest this a year ago.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.534
Now it's your idea?

08:55.536 --> 08:56.968
Munoz: Gentlemen,
I respectfully submit

08:56.970 --> 09:00.105
That we all follow the rules
of parliamentary procedure,

09:00.107 --> 09:02.173
Which we all agreed to

09:02.175 --> 09:04.209
Prior to today.
Kreshenko: We also agreed

09:04.211 --> 09:07.045
To no more military border
maneuvers.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.013
And their army
has since positioned...

09:08.015 --> 09:10.048
Hey, you know what?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.883
Uh, I suggest
some honey mead.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.290
(quietly):
What are you talking about?
Come on, gentlemen.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.658
I know someone here brought
the mead.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.692
How else would we toast

09:20.694 --> 09:23.161
To peace when this
is all over?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.932
Drinks are a good idea.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.102
In these nations, you don't
fix emotional arguments

09:31.104 --> 09:32.804
With rules of procedure.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.941
Old enough
that they all lay claim to it.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.282
I want her off the grounds. Now.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.717
Like hell.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.353
She just did your job for you.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.623
It's just pouring drinks, but
she's got them working together.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.358
She stays.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.026
Kreshenko:
Okay.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.161
Raise your glasses.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.996
<i>Sveiks.</i>

10:04.837 --> 10:07.105
(groans)

10:07.107 --> 10:08.740
Mr. President!
Mr. Kreshenko!

10:08.742 --> 10:10.175
I'll get the doctor!

10:12.044 --> 10:14.112
Mr. President!
Mr. Kreshenko!

10:14.114 --> 10:15.146
Mikko!

10:15.148 --> 10:16.748
(urgent chatter)

10:16.750 --> 10:18.917
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.186
I'm an md. Shut up.
I need to hear his breathing.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.287
Doc, what the hell's going on?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.255
Well, he's been poisoned.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.127
He is a u.N.-Certified physician
assigned to the summit.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.196
You will all pay
for what you've done!

10:31.198 --> 10:32.697
Yashin!

10:33.299 --> 10:34.899
Hey, hey, hey!

10:37.103 --> 10:38.136
Put down your weapons!

10:41.040 --> 10:42.340
You're outmanned
and you're outgunned!

10:42.342 --> 10:43.808
Now lower
your weapons!

10:43.810 --> 10:45.043
Walter:
Actually, uh, cabe,

10:45.045 --> 10:47.045
You're wrong.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.681
The firepower is...

10:49.683 --> 10:51.149
Evenly matched.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.785
If everyone were
to fire simultaneously,

10:53.787 --> 10:55.086
Then those two gentlemen
over there

10:55.088 --> 10:57.889
Would kill each other,
that marine over there

10:57.891 --> 11:00.058
Would take out yashin,
the falling bodies would

11:00.060 --> 11:02.127
Expose those behind them
to oncoming fire

11:02.129 --> 11:03.762
From the other
marines,

11:03.764 --> 11:06.865
And we would wind up with--
excuse me-- three dead

11:06.867 --> 11:08.033
Security personnel

11:08.035 --> 11:09.334
And three dead politicians.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.436
Based on quick vector
and percentage

11:11.438 --> 11:14.439
Calculation,
almost 100% certainty.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.041
Sylvester, how are my numbers?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.410
Sounds pretty good to me.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.146
Toby: It's actually four
dead politicians

11:21.148 --> 11:22.781
If kreshenko
isn't treated asap.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.082
Mikko:
This was a setup!

11:24.084 --> 11:26.051
You brought the bottle.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.919
Sakovich poured it,

11:27.921 --> 11:29.454
And juris passed it out.
Everyone had access.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.957
Except somebody was
planning this all along,

11:32.959 --> 11:35.694
And the mead was the
perfect opportunity.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.696
Now, this man needs
medical care, stat.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.798
No one goes in or
out of the grounds.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.733
From here out,
everyone is

11:41.735 --> 11:42.734
A suspect.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.035
We're on lockdown.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.341
Pulse is dropping significantly.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.943
Heart rate's slowed to 42 bpm.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.848
He's in bradycardia.
Whatever poison he's ingested,

11:56.850 --> 11:57.849
It's taking hold.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.084
I have adrenaline in my kit.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.820
If I mix it exactly
with the atropine

12:01.822 --> 12:03.188
And nifedipine,
that may buy some time.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.823
How long?
Without an antidote?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.458
This man will be dead
in 90 minutes.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.059
Sylvester: We can't access
an antidote because

12:08.061 --> 12:09.861
We don't know
what the poison is.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.431
Things might get a lot worse
before they get better.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.800
Paige, you did a good job
of calming things down earlier.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.736
Go see if you can't
settle them down again.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.870
Toby:
I'm gonna go with her.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.406
If we find the culprit,
we'll have a better chance

12:21.408 --> 12:23.341
Of figuring out
what was put in his drink.
Go.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.045
We all know what happens
if word gets out

12:27.047 --> 12:28.246
That there was
an assassination attempt

12:28.248 --> 12:30.014
During furtive
peace talks.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.817
Weaponry will be readied,
military strikes commenced.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.986
And that'll be the start
of world war three.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.033
Happy:
I know this isn't good,

12:49.035 --> 12:51.136
But do we really think
a world war can break out

12:51.138 --> 12:53.338
From the death
of the president of the 89th

12:53.340 --> 12:55.406
Most populated nation
on the planet?

12:55.408 --> 12:59.344
Of the assassination of
the archduke franz ferdinand,

12:59.346 --> 13:02.313
A man that 99% of the planet
had never even heard of,

13:02.315 --> 13:03.948
So not only is
it possible,

13:03.950 --> 13:05.283
But it's happened already.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.986
We have to prevent these guys

13:07.988 --> 13:11.122
From transmitting any
communications from this ranch.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.959
We could piggyback on the wi-fi
to place our own virtual

13:14.961 --> 13:16.561
Local area network

13:16.563 --> 13:18.296
Around the entire compound.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.200
We'll capture any e-mails,
texts, phone calls

13:22.202 --> 13:23.868
From anyone on this property.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.270
We can't let them know
we muzzled them.
They won't.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.005
They'll think their messages
are being received,

13:27.007 --> 13:28.840
Because sylvester will respond

13:28.842 --> 13:30.074
Posing as
their associates.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.011
When I said I was
uncomfortable with deception?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.012
Uh-huh.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.246
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.481
Still uncomfortable.

13:49.962 --> 13:50.962
Please, if you'll just...

13:50.964 --> 13:52.163
Can you even read them

13:52.165 --> 13:53.531
When you don't know
what they're saying?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.834
Universal micro-tells
transcend language,

13:55.836 --> 13:57.302
But they're politicians;
they're trained liars.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.103
So I'm getting bubkes.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.305
If they calm down,

14:00.307 --> 14:03.074
I might be able
to pick up on something.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.912
I think I have an idea.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.452
Don't keep me in the dark.
What are you up to?

14:14.454 --> 14:16.454
Mitzy von schneiden.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.590
Singer from the 1920s
whose mother was latvian,

14:18.592 --> 14:20.124
Dad was lithuanian.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.292
She studied in belarus.

14:21.294 --> 14:26.197
And it's hard to keep
fighting when listening to

14:26.199 --> 14:27.999
The lullaby
your mother used to sing you.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.334
(gentle music playing)

14:29.336 --> 14:32.270
That's actually a good idea.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.239
(woman singing
in foreign language)

14:42.648 --> 14:45.950
This song is beautiful.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.521
If kreshenko dies,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.390
Hopefully
a  <i>pill-naja-bura</i>

14:52.392 --> 14:54.259
Doesn't keep us
from his funeral.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.462
Oh, god.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.198
Toby, I think I know
what was given to kreshenko.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.501
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

15:05.971 --> 15:08.539
Cyber noose is trapping
a lot of e-mails

15:08.541 --> 15:11.576
And text messages--
all to colleagues back home,

15:11.578 --> 15:13.344
All of shock and dismay
at the poisoning.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.445
Nothing nefarious here yet,
either.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.647
Hopefully this will

15:15.649 --> 15:18.283
Keep his heart going
until we can determine

15:18.285 --> 15:20.518
Exactly what we need to do.
Toby: No!

15:23.522 --> 15:24.989
Chong:
What the hell?

15:24.991 --> 15:26.958
Gallo...
What is your man doing?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.060
That adrenaline would've
killed him instantly.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.496
Paige. The... The dust storm.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.164
Merrick, it all makes sense.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.499
Paige:
The guy from belarus

15:34.501 --> 15:38.336
That's "dust storm"
in belarusian,

15:38.338 --> 15:39.938
Effectively a curse word
in the nation's history.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.706
And it all started
with the venom from a snake.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.075
In 1897, the
first war between

15:44.077 --> 15:46.711
Belarus and lithuania broke out
after what was deemed to be

15:46.713 --> 15:49.080
Blatant disrespect
by the belarus government.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.315
I don't need
a book report right now.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.216
She actually has
some good ideas.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.218
Paige, go on.
Paige: Okay, so,

15:54.220 --> 15:55.520
The lithuanian
president's child

15:55.522 --> 15:58.222
Died after being bitten
by a venomous snake,

15:58.224 --> 16:00.425
And the belarus diplomats
didn't show up for the funeral.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.061
The excuse was that there was
this terrible dust storm.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.163
But that excuse wasn't accepted,
and what followed

16:05.165 --> 16:07.031
Was a four-year war

16:07.033 --> 16:08.366
And the tensions
we're still seeing today.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.634
Toby: According to paige,
the venom in the boy

16:09.636 --> 16:11.669
Caused an immediate
red spread, hives

16:11.671 --> 16:14.038
In the arms and neck,
just like kreshenko.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.473
If the venom was given to him

16:15.475 --> 16:17.575
As a symbolic "screw you,"
then that adrenaline

16:17.577 --> 16:19.610
Will make the venom work faster
and kill him instantly.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.212
You know, gallo,
you listening to these loons

16:21.214 --> 16:23.147
Is one thing,
but now you got the waitress

16:23.149 --> 16:25.283
Calling the shots?
Walter:
Are we judging people

16:25.285 --> 16:27.085
Based on past resumes?

16:27.087 --> 16:31.756
A department store santa to
help pay for your college.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.225
How the hell
did you find that out?

16:34.227 --> 16:37.161
Look, the point is, if we don't
get meds into kreshenko

16:37.163 --> 16:38.529
And he dies, it's our asses.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.698
If you're wrong,
he'll die instantly.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.233
Yeah, and if she's wrong,
then we had a chance

16:42.235 --> 16:43.334
To save a president
and we didn't.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.435
Debating this
wastes precious time.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.737
Now, paige,
it's up to you, okay?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.638
How certain are you
of what you heard?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.575
I'm 100% confident
in what I heard

16:50.577 --> 16:51.776
And what I'm telling you.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.478
Then there's our answer.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.779
This is ridiculous.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.016
I started a course
of treatment for this man.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.151
I'm finishing the protocol.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.619
Hey!

17:01.621 --> 17:03.788
Are you out of your mind?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.691
That was the only adrenaline
I had on site!

17:07.292 --> 17:10.128
I trust my team.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.064
The safe call
was to follow procedure.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.665
And if he died, he died.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.267
Now it's our necks.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.468
I'm gonna arrest
president sakovich,

17:17.470 --> 17:20.405
But the lockdown
pertains to all of you.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.306
Nobody leaves the grounds
until that man

17:22.308 --> 17:23.708
Is either saved

17:23.710 --> 17:25.243
Or he's dead.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.245
'cause I am not eating
this bullet alone

17:27.247 --> 17:28.413
If this goes south.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.652
Forget homeland,
he should work for the treasury

17:34.654 --> 17:36.154
The way he passes the buck.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.688
Focus. We have barely an hour,

17:37.690 --> 17:40.091
And we don't know what kind
of venom we're dealing with.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.626
Sylvester: There are
numerous deadly

17:41.628 --> 17:44.562
Eastern european snakes,
several of which can cause

17:44.564 --> 17:46.431
Reddish hives.
Sly, toby,

17:46.433 --> 17:47.765
You figure out what kind of
belarusian snake

17:47.767 --> 17:49.333
We're looking for.
Happy, paige, and I--

17:49.335 --> 17:52.303
We'll go down to the reptile
sanctuary down the pch.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.471
Then when we get there,
you can tell us

17:53.473 --> 17:54.739
What kind of snake
we need to procure.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.442
Then we'll make an
antidote with its venom.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.344
You heard merrick.
No one's going anywhere.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.713
I think I have a way
around that.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.292
Zoom in,
camera one, north gate.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.195
Someone's taking pictures.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.230
Get director merrick.
Sir.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.707
Great, just-just keep that
camera in front of your face.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.209
Come and get me, dummies.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.378
Merrick: All corps
to the north gate. Now!

18:35.848 --> 18:37.849
All right, come on. Hustle.
Where we going?

18:37.851 --> 18:39.884
Right here.
Okay, hurry.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.352
Okay, come on.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.254
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.225
Cabe, I do not mean to rush you,
but if they come back here

18:47.227 --> 18:49.293
And we're trapped...
It's in here somewhere.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.196
Dvd commentary on <i>blackrock</i>
<i>shootout</i> said they left intact

18:52.198 --> 18:54.732
The secret door
the deputy used to escape.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.268
Pays to be a fanboy.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.537
All right, head east over that
hill; there should be a trail,

18:59.539 --> 19:01.873
Take you to a road.
Now go get us a snake.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.375
See you later.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.344
Come on, let's go.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.214
Sir!

19:10.216 --> 19:12.717
I checked the perimeter
from that bluff.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.785
There's no sign of anyone,
not even vehicle tracks.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.587
Well, he's got to be
here somewhere.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.756
It's not like the guy
just appeared and disappeared.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.760
Son of a bitch.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.364
I don't want any evidence
of what we've been up to.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.166
Merrick:
Gallo!

19:28.901 --> 19:31.569
You two, get out.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.273
Ooh, cabe's in trouble.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.209
Do you have stockholm syndrome?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.178
Just do whatever
these eggheads say?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.914
What you did is insubordination,
borderline treason.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.482
I made a choice
to save a man's life.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.884
No, you made a choice to
defy me and to back them.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.920
You don't work as closely
with scorpion as I do.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.821
You just don't know
how they go about things.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.723
I know that you've
been mesmerized

19:52.725 --> 19:54.525
By this kid walter from
the minute you met him.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.361
I'm no more mesmerized by him
than you are threatened.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.330
And our job is
to protect people,

19:59.332 --> 20:00.665
Not our own backsides.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.967
Now, let me ask
you a question.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.803
You think that you and walter
would be such great pals

20:05.805 --> 20:08.239
If he knew what really
happened in baghdad

20:08.241 --> 20:09.807
With that software
you had him make?

20:09.809 --> 20:13.244
What if I tell him?

20:13.246 --> 20:16.447
Let me be clear.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.683
What walter knows

20:18.685 --> 20:20.952
And what he needs to know
is up to me.

20:20.954 --> 20:25.223
If you disclose anything to him,
you and I will have a problem

20:25.225 --> 20:27.825
Where rank doesn't
come into play.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.894
Do you copy?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.670
Not sure where we are,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.006
But I know it's nowhere
near the reptile sanctuary.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.342
Now what?
Hitchhike?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.610
I'm not showing leg.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.645
No, there's no time
to hitchhike.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.648
Happy, I hear a truck. Quick.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.350
Punch me in the nose.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.918
Finally.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.319
(groans)

20:55.321 --> 20:57.321
Good job.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.390
(grunts)

21:00.592 --> 21:02.260
Paige:
What is he doing?

21:02.262 --> 21:05.263
Hey! Hey!

21:12.304 --> 21:13.738
Hey, man, you okay?

21:13.740 --> 21:15.439
Not really. I was hiking,
and I fell on my face.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.907
Have you got any ice?

21:16.909 --> 21:18.509
Some ice? Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come around back.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.378
Okay.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.050
Hey.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.687
Come on in.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.022
Thanks.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.391
Here's your ice.
Thank you.
Also, sorry.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.525
What's up?
Hit it, happy!

21:35.560 --> 21:36.927
Walter:
We'll return it!

21:36.929 --> 21:38.296
Official government business!

21:40.666 --> 21:43.334
Okay, so we get
to the reptile sanctuary...

21:43.336 --> 21:46.604
Find the curator,
have him get us the right snake.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.406
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

21:48.408 --> 21:51.042
We gonna tell him someone
we know, but can't disclose,

21:51.044 --> 21:53.077
Has been bitten
by a deadly snake

21:53.079 --> 21:55.946
That may or may not be native
to this area,

21:55.948 --> 21:58.349
And he just has to trust us
and give us that snake,

21:58.351 --> 21:59.750
Even though venomous snakes
are regulated by the state,

21:59.752 --> 22:02.753
And giving us one
could land him in prison?

22:02.755 --> 22:05.089
Oh, you got a better idea?
We steal the snake.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.590
We steal the snake.

22:12.931 --> 22:15.399
This is a violation
of the geneva convention.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.368
So is assassination.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.469
You pig!

22:18.471 --> 22:20.404
I will kill you
for what you've done!

22:21.341 --> 22:24.342
You keep cool,
or I'll cuff you

22:24.344 --> 22:25.343
Right alongside these men.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.891
There are too many
belarusian snakes.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.127
There's no way
to know which one it is.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.596
Is that what you're gonna
tell walter when we call him?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.398
I don't know anything
about snakes.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.899
This wasn't even my idea.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.369
Ah, ah,
there's no "I" in scorpion.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.805
It's a figure of speech.
Oh.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.441
Cyber noose just got another
text. This one's from mikko.

22:57.443 --> 23:00.144
I'm putting it
in the translator now.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.812
"everything is in place,
moving forward"?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.547
I don't like the sound of that.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.716
You know, it's ambiguous.
It could mean nothing.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.052
The man's president is dying.
He's not gonna send

23:08.054 --> 23:09.754
An international text
to someone that means nothing.

23:09.756 --> 23:10.921
That's ambiguous on purpose,

23:10.923 --> 23:12.656
But it means something.
What?

23:12.658 --> 23:15.960
You think mikko could be the one
who slipped his boss a mickey?

23:17.496 --> 23:19.697
The text was meant
for someone named

23:19.699 --> 23:22.867
Eras ilgauskas,
and a quick search shows that

23:22.869 --> 23:25.870
Artillery production
and distribution.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.539
You think mikko could be
in the weapons game with him?
That would explain

23:28.541 --> 23:31.041
Why he did something that could
cause world war three.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.043
If kreshenko signs that peace
treaty, then there's no war,

23:33.045 --> 23:35.012
And if there's no war,
there's no weapons to sell.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.014
We arrested the wrong guys.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.183
And we're looking for
the wrong type of snake.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.952
We need something from
the lithuanian region.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.187
That's where mikko's from.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.755
And there's only one snake

23:44.757 --> 23:46.557
That matches our specific
set of symptoms.

23:46.559 --> 23:47.792
The adder.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.536
Toby says we got the wrong guys.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.070
It was kreshenko's advisor.

24:00.072 --> 24:05.142
The best route to the snake is
the side employees' entrance.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.544
Once in, to avoid security,

24:06.546 --> 24:07.978
You're gonna have
to use the cross beams

24:07.980 --> 24:10.014
Above the displays.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.615
I didn't design
the building, man.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.620
We can still communicate
within the cyber noose,

24:16.622 --> 24:18.989
So we need to
respond to his text.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.459
There's no way mikko doesn't
expect to hear back from him,

24:21.461 --> 24:23.060
A co-conspirator in
an assassination.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.629
If he doesn't, he'll
get suspicious.
What do I say?

24:25.631 --> 24:27.198
Uh, needs to be ambiguous,
as well.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.633
Just confirmation of receipt.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.068
That's what they
would've planned.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.103
Okay. How about "thank you"?
Sure.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.006
Why don't you put a thumbs up
emoticon at the end of it, too?

24:36.008 --> 24:37.675
Just send "confirmed."

24:37.677 --> 24:40.744
No. Send... "okay."

24:40.746 --> 24:43.514
No! Send "okay.
Confirmed."

24:43.516 --> 24:45.983
You're confusing me.
Just send "confirmed."

24:45.985 --> 24:48.486
That's it.
Just send that.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.021
Sent. You think
he'll buy it?
Yeah.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.691
Unless they had a specific
code word planned in advance.
Yeah.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.793
Let's go tell cabe
we got our guy.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.127
(footsteps approaching)

24:59.231 --> 25:00.998
I think they had a code word.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.134
No. That's the running
of the bulls in ventura.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.236
Yes, it's him!
Okay.

25:05.238 --> 25:07.638
What do I do?
What do I do?

25:09.608 --> 25:12.776
You are
the computer experts, no?

25:12.778 --> 25:14.578
No.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.616
(sighs)

25:18.618 --> 25:19.884
We dabble.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.887
Give me your phone.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.221
Easy, mongo.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.057
I know you texted me!

25:27.059 --> 25:28.826
(grunting)

25:28.828 --> 25:30.160
Hit him, sly!

25:30.162 --> 25:32.129
Okay!
Hit him! I got him!

25:37.202 --> 25:39.136
(groaning)

25:41.773 --> 25:43.974
Soldier:
Stop! U.S. Marine!

25:43.976 --> 25:45.643
He's the assassin!

25:46.878 --> 25:49.113
Solider:
Got eyes on him!

25:50.181 --> 25:51.181
Are you okay, sly?

25:51.183 --> 25:54.752
You guys all right?
(groans)
it was mikko.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.221
He framed
those belarus boys.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.822
Big guy's fast.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.059
(animals squawking)

26:02.061 --> 26:04.295
Man:
Welcome, gang.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.797
Got a lot of neat stuff
to see and learn today,

26:06.799 --> 26:07.965
So head on in.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.166
Just follow
these footprints.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.200
Excuse me, sir.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.969
Can you help me?

26:11.971 --> 26:14.004
I am the teacher's assistant
with this class,

26:14.006 --> 26:18.142
But I... I'm so terrified
of snakes, and I was...

26:18.144 --> 26:21.245
C-can you stand
with me during

26:21.247 --> 26:22.746
Your presentation,
please?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.114
Please?

26:24.116 --> 26:27.952
I won't leave your side
if you don't want me to.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.219
Oh, thank you.

26:29.221 --> 26:33.057
I'm so lucky to have someone
like you looking after me.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.692
How long
have you worked here?

26:37.228 --> 26:39.930
Your friend better get back here
with that venom soon.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.198
He's almost gone.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.077
Walter (quietly):
Happy,

26:53.079 --> 26:54.678
Am I getting any closer?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.814
All I can see are

26:56.816 --> 26:58.749
A bunch of turtles.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.150
Hang a left.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.219
Okay.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.090
Got snakes?

27:06.092 --> 27:08.826
Mm, yeah, getting there.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.827
You okay?

27:09.829 --> 27:11.028
Sure.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.296
Are you scared of snakes?

27:12.298 --> 27:14.031
Oh, no.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.265
Walter, I've seen you
diffuse a bomb.

27:15.267 --> 27:18.836
That risk was calculable.

27:18.838 --> 27:23.273
You cannot predict
what a wild animal will do.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.143
I'm just gonna reach down,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.712
Scoop up the snake
and then get out.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.114
Limited risk.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.016
I will be fine.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.951
Okay, you have to make sure
you don't harm the snake

27:33.953 --> 27:34.985
When you retrieve it.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.856
Hell no. Those
things are deadly.
Guide: Okay, kids.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.858
If I could have everybody
at this window over here.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.394
If everyone stays quiet,
I can tell you about

27:43.396 --> 27:46.664
The over 40 breeds of venomous
snakes that we have here.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.365
Now, many of these snakes
come from

27:48.367 --> 27:52.236
A tropical, wet climate,
but since socal is a desert,

27:52.238 --> 27:54.238
Who would like to make
our snakes feel more at home?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.907
You certainly look
like a snake lover.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.877
Press that little red button
and see what happens.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.445
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.714
Guide:
You made it rain!

28:06.251 --> 28:08.786
Oh! Oh! Oh!
(children screaming)

28:08.788 --> 28:10.220
Let's make our way to
the exit, kids.
Call security!

28:10.222 --> 28:11.455
Walter.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.223
Okay. Not good.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.758
(groans)

28:14.760 --> 28:17.027
Oh, boy. A deadly snake.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.862
(hissing)

28:26.004 --> 28:28.138
(hissing)

28:28.140 --> 28:30.107
Walter, don't move.

28:30.109 --> 28:34.945
We need a tan snake with a
zigzag pattern along its back.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.881
I think that's the one, the
one that's near your business.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.950
Guys.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.285
There's a tan snake

28:41.287 --> 28:43.320
With a different zigzag pattern
in this tree.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.355
Which one do we want?

28:45.357 --> 28:48.025
How the hell should I
know? I'm a mechanic.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.160
Paige: Can we try and capture
both of them, make antidotes

28:50.162 --> 28:52.096
Out of both venom,
see which one works?

28:52.098 --> 28:54.298
No. There is barely enough time
to make one antivenom.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.100
(hissing)

28:56.102 --> 28:58.102
I have an idea.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.104
Happy:
Uh, are you doing

29:00.106 --> 29:01.505
What I think you're doing?
Paige: What?

29:01.507 --> 29:02.973
Wait. Walter,
what are you doing?

29:04.008 --> 29:05.042
Walter,

29:05.044 --> 29:08.779
Process of elimination
is our most efficient

29:08.781 --> 29:10.114
Path.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.215
Come on, come on, come on.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.852
Whoa!

29:14.854 --> 29:15.886
(yells)

29:15.888 --> 29:17.020
Crap.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.889
(groans)

29:20.859 --> 29:22.793
I think we've got
the right snake.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.194
(groans)

29:24.196 --> 29:26.263
Okay, move.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.138
(muttering)

29:34.140 --> 29:36.173
Watch the snake.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.908
Paige:
What the hell is

29:37.910 --> 29:39.176
The plan here?
To make an antidote,

29:39.178 --> 29:41.311
We need a host
to inject a little bit

29:41.313 --> 29:44.047
Of venom into, not enough to
kill it, but enough to develop

29:44.049 --> 29:45.916
Antibodies. There.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.284
That's our host.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.787
Yeah.
I'm on it.

29:50.855 --> 29:51.922
One ferret coming up!

29:51.924 --> 29:53.257
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.362
(ferret squeaking)

30:00.298 --> 30:01.298
Yep.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.367
(tires screeching)

30:05.403 --> 30:08.806
Ah! Come on!
Don't be stingy!

30:10.208 --> 30:12.543
Okay, I think I got enough.
Uh, yeah. I got enough.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.077
How are you still functioning

30:14.079 --> 30:17.080
While kreshenko's
barely alive? (gasps)

30:17.082 --> 30:18.949
Because I'm younger.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.218
But we have to get back
to the ranch fast. Happy.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.954
Hey, I'm doing 90 in a burrito
truck. Cut me some slack.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.956
Okay, hold him still.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.891
Wait, is this gonna hurt him?
I'm so glad

30:27.893 --> 30:29.092
That you're concerned
about the ferret.

30:29.094 --> 30:30.961
I'm sorry.
Okay, buddy.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.230
Help me out here.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.415
(gunshot)

31:17.308 --> 31:18.976
Next time...

31:18.978 --> 31:21.478
Let your horse do the thinking.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.213
He's smarter.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.514
(tires screeching)

31:24.516 --> 31:25.649
Soldier:
Freeze!

31:25.651 --> 31:26.650
Stop right now!

31:26.652 --> 31:29.052
Stop the vehicle!
Halt!

31:29.054 --> 31:32.322
We're the homeland guys.
We've got an antidote.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.195
Okay. Come on, walt.
We're almost there.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.997
Careful on those steps, happy.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.565
There's taco grease!

31:41.567 --> 31:43.567
(grunts)
oh, no.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.168
What did you do?

31:45.170 --> 31:47.337
I dropped the ferret.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.311
Oh, he does not look good.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.513
The fuel quotients for
the rockets are off.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.248
Chong: He's rambling.
He's delusional.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.385
Toby: Walter, what the hell
were you thinking?

32:01.387 --> 32:05.522
The antibodies are
in the host organism.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.392
Paige: I slipped on taco grease
getting out of the van,

32:08.394 --> 32:10.427
And when I fell, the ferret
with the venom got away.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.362
That's the first time
anyone has ever said that.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.131
I got to go help
happy find him.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.432
Walter:
Paige, I'm sorry. I...

32:15.434 --> 32:17.501
What?

32:19.103 --> 32:21.405
I'm sorry.

32:23.241 --> 32:24.942
I had reservations.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.644
Reservations about what?

32:27.646 --> 32:30.314
I-I never took you to dinner.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.083
Whoa, little sucker's fast.

32:36.321 --> 32:38.288
What am I supposed to do
with this thing?

32:38.290 --> 32:42.359
Chong: I need
a high-speed centrifuge

32:42.361 --> 32:44.962
To separate out the antibody
from the ferret blood.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.730
Yeah, walter must've had
a plan here.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.032
Walter's not talking
right now, toby.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.268
Toby: Okay, okay...
They're dead men.
They're going to die.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.369
Let me think, okay?

32:52.371 --> 32:54.171
What is there to think about?

32:54.173 --> 32:58.408
Without processing it.
Million-to-one shot but
what choice do we have?

32:58.410 --> 33:00.544
No, you're not taking
a million-to-one shot with my
friend's life, you understand?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.145
You go near him
with that ferret,

33:02.147 --> 33:04.147
I'm gonna cram that furry
little dude up in a place

33:04.149 --> 33:06.283
It can never run away from.
You follow?

33:06.285 --> 33:09.653
We just need to separate
the antibodies from the plasma.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.155
Somehow simulate
a high-speed centrifuge.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.324
You came here
in a taco truck, right?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.693
Okay.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.766
Oh!

33:22.768 --> 33:23.600
Salad spinner! Let's go.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.202
All right, come on!

33:37.048 --> 33:39.049
Okay. Now we wait.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.418
Even if we save
kreshenko,

33:41.420 --> 33:44.154
These guys are so
distrustful of one another,

33:44.156 --> 33:46.390
They'll never sit
down and negotiate.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.792
Well, then we'll have
to figure out a way

33:48.794 --> 33:51.061
To motivate them
to want to.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.501
(woman speaking indistinctly
over tv)

34:02.073 --> 34:03.373
How'd we do?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.042
Walter.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.476
How are you feeling?

34:06.478 --> 34:08.545
Oh, terrible. (chuckles)

34:10.181 --> 34:12.682
But, uh, worse
now that I've seen this.

34:16.254 --> 34:18.321
So kreshenko died,

34:18.323 --> 34:20.057
Word got out,
and now we're off

34:20.059 --> 34:21.491
To a decade
of death and destruction?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.493
Not exactly.

34:28.499 --> 34:29.499
Are they...

34:29.501 --> 34:30.767
Signing a
peace treaty?

34:30.769 --> 34:32.502
You bet they are.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.604
We showed them what would happen
if they didn't.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.673
Come with me.
I'll show you.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.580
Merrick:
Gallo,

34:43.582 --> 34:47.517
I know today was rough
and we went at it,

34:47.519 --> 34:50.487
But you got the ball
into the end zone.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.190
I won't forget
what you did.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.561
And you threatened to
disclose something to walter

34:57.563 --> 35:00.831
I don't ever
want shared.

35:00.833 --> 35:04.134
I won't forget
what you did, either.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.207
Reporter: Both sides are set
to start pulling back

35:10.209 --> 35:12.209
Heavy weapons on Tuesday
to create a buffer zone

35:12.211 --> 35:14.277
Of up to 140 kilometers.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.716
You used my software.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.785
Old footage
of lithuanian tank maneuvers

35:21.787 --> 35:23.453
Laid over border territories

35:23.455 --> 35:25.755
They have never
been near before.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.557
Soldiers disembarking tanks,

35:27.559 --> 35:29.292
Except we put them
near the disputed boundaries.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.627
Images over images.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.629
Like colorforms.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.465
The United States and germany
have promised ground troops

35:35.467 --> 35:38.635
Immediately, a move the russian
government has called

35:38.637 --> 35:41.204
An act
of direct aggression.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.473
She's using
my voice dubbing software.
No.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.542
Actually, the british accent's
happy's real voice.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.477
She's been lying to us
the whole time.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.679
We just spliced the
wiring of our broadcast

35:49.681 --> 35:51.648
To the satellite dish on the
roof, so now everybody thinks

35:51.650 --> 35:53.350
They're watching the real news.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.385
That is fantastic work, guys.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.486
Sylvester:
Just call us

35:56.488 --> 35:58.155
The ghosts of christmas future.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.890
We scared the hell out of them.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.558
They ran
to the bargaining table.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.495
So, uh, what happens when they
get back and find out the truth?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.297
What are they gonna say?
That a bunch of schmucks

36:07.299 --> 36:08.832
Who work out of a garage
outsmarted them?

36:08.834 --> 36:11.468
Those guys want
to get re-elected.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.807
â™ª

36:32.723 --> 36:34.891
(sighs)
where is it?

36:34.893 --> 36:36.693
Happy:
Doc.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.662
Come here a minute.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.365
What's up?

36:53.844 --> 36:56.780
When you grabbed that doctor
and put him in his place,

36:56.782 --> 36:59.282
It was hot.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.283
Um...

37:00.285 --> 37:02.552
Thank you for that...

37:02.554 --> 37:03.687
Shh.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.723
Just don't talk.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.658
Don't ruin it.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.960
Okay.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.996
Okay.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.703
(sighs)

37:21.672 --> 37:23.406
(sniffs)

37:23.408 --> 37:26.409
Why's it smell like seawater?

37:26.411 --> 37:29.679
I formulated, uh,
an electrolyte solution.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.482
It's more efficient
than the market brands.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.651
It tastes, um...

37:34.653 --> 37:36.853
Disgusting.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.655
Taking that bite today

37:38.657 --> 37:42.759
I know we go down a lot of
dicey roads, but that was...

37:42.761 --> 37:43.960
It was necessary.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.629
War was imminent.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.764
Still, I don't like you taking
that kind of risk.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.333
Noted.

37:58.542 --> 38:01.511
You look like you're going
to say something.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.712
(ferret squeaking)

38:04.782 --> 38:05.782
You kept it?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.284
He saved my life.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.686
Least I could do
is save it from becoming a...

38:09.688 --> 38:11.688
Snake's lunch.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.623
Toby named it ferret bueller.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.892
I don't understand
the reference.

38:15.894 --> 38:18.662
Paige: I need my
history textbook.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.663
I'm already late
as hell!

38:19.665 --> 38:23.333
Why she didn't tell me
she was taking a night class.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.634
You, this group,

38:24.636 --> 38:26.603
It's a lot to compete
with academically.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.506
She knows
there's no reason to compete.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.441
And that
she can't compete.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.643
Just like we can't compete
with her

38:33.645 --> 38:35.712
In so many regards.

38:35.714 --> 38:39.616
So... Why keep
that hidden?

38:39.618 --> 38:42.852
There's a million reasons
why people keep secrets.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.956
Sometimes we just
can't understand.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.626
Paige:
No! No, no!

38:49.628 --> 38:52.929
Busted water main on sunset.
Traffic's gridlocked.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.931
There's no way
I'll make my final.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.599
I'm gonna flunk.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.668
I need a favor.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.339
(siren whooping)

39:05.810 --> 39:07.811
Paige:
<i>Oh, my god, I made it.</i>

39:07.813 --> 39:09.612
This is amazing.

39:09.614 --> 39:11.481
Seven minutes to spare.

39:11.483 --> 39:12.816
(chuckles)

39:12.818 --> 39:14.951
I-I didn't have a chance
to cram today.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.821
I know you think this stuff
is nonsense, but...

39:17.823 --> 39:19.756
I'm nervous.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.791
You outshined and impressed

39:21.793 --> 39:24.094
A seasoned
diplomatic envoy today.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.763
So if you can do that,
you can crush the test.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.900
I'm proud of you.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.870
Thank you, walter.
