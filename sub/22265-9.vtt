12:45.760 --> 12:46.897
Putting that junk in my body.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.547
But it's the only thing
that keeps me awake,

12:48.640 --> 12:49.709
it's the only thing that,

12:50.960 --> 12:53.861
that keeps me from the Bad Place.

13:02.120 --> 13:06.739
Yes, we all have our bad places,
don't we?

13:07.760 --> 13:08.943
The stuff we're running from,

13:09.280 --> 13:12.022
the things that we try to blot out
with drugs or drink,

13:13.360 --> 13:15.260
we have to face it eventually, don't we?

13:22.440 --> 13:23.429

13:24.440 --> 13:25.429
Hey there.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.149
I'm Jack.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.309
Hi, Jack.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.097
- You're new.
- Yes, I am.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.544
SO, what's your poison?

13:48.480 --> 13:49.469
Why are you here?

13:50.840 --> 13:53.343
I like cocaine.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.580
Okay, Sweet Life.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.817
I don't know why you're really here,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.899
but you're going to have to find
a new "day one" buddy,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.262
because it's not really my thing.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.827
I know who you are, Kaia.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.778
I'm a friend Of Derek's.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.619
He told me about you,
said you were like him.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.583
(SOFI'LY) Dreamwalker.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.029
What?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.020
He said you were the most powerful one
he's ever known.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.349
And I need your help.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.781
Look, I don't know what you think
you know about dreamwalking.

14:23.880 --> 14:24.949
And I can help you.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.823
I can get you out of here.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.349
H ow?

14:29.480 --> 14:30.617
Follow me.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.865
SAM: So, Kaia never knew her father.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.423
Her mom died in an accident
when she was twelve

14:49.960 --> 14:52.463
so her aunt took her in
and then she died. Cancer.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.743
- Damn.
- Yeah.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.105
Been on her ever since
until her OD and arrest.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.423
- Bad hand.
- Yeah.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.839
No wonder she ended up here.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.223
Kaia? Where are you going?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.987
- Keep walking.
- You're not allowed to be here.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.029
- What did you do?
- Don't worry, he's just sleeping.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.022
You're not the only one with powers.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.422
That door was triple-locked.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.344
Was it?

15:31.440 --> 15:34.000
- What are you?
- That's a long story. This way.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.657
Yeah, no.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.469
What?

15:37.560 --> 15:39.027
Look, thanks for the jailbreak and all,

15:39.120 --> 15:41.384
but I don't know you and I don't know
what the hell is going on, so I'm out.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.177
No, we had a deal.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.061
You said you'd get me out,
that's the deal I heard.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.821
- You can't.
- Watch me.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.149
No.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.547
You will help me.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.029
Jack!

15:52.240 --> 15:53.229
Sam?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.177
(GRU NTS)

15:58.560 --> 15:59.629
She hit me.

15:59.880 --> 16:00.904
Yeah, good.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.865
- No, she's getting away. She can't...
- No. Hey!

16:02.960 --> 16:05.622
We're not letting you near her
until you tell us what's going on.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.938
- No, I need her.
- You need her like you needed Derek?

16:08.040 --> 16:09.029
Yes.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.189
You don't...

16:14.280 --> 16:15.668
I'm doing this for you.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.387
You killed Derek for us?

16:18.680 --> 16:19.669
Derek's dead?

16:23.200 --> 16:26.146
Wait, hold on a second,
Jack, tell us what happened.

16:26.880 --> 16:27.869
Everything.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.542
I left to try to get a grip
on my powers.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.739
I wanted to prove to you that I'm good.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.299
To do one good thing,

16:36.880 --> 16:38.381
so I did the thing you wanted the most.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.546
I experimented,
opening doors to other worlds.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.629
I could almost do it.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.143
I could get right to the edge,
but I couldn't see,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.185
I could only feel around in the dark.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.502
I needed eyes. A seer.

16:52.680 --> 16:53.863
A dreamwalker.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.669
Yeah.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.377
SO I researched, like you taught me.
That's how I found Derek.

17:02.920 --> 17:03.989
Hello.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.541
I didn ’t know if it would work,

17:08.160 --> 17:09.184
but it did.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.339
He dreamwa/ked and I joined him.

I
saw...

17:39.520 --> 17:41.704
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.789
I saw her.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.869
Her?

17:45.560 --> 17:46.549
Your mother.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.669
She's alive.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.461
- What?
- But she's in danger.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.061
What does that mean?
What kind of danger?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.307

I was so close to her,
I could've touched her.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.419
But Derek wasn't strong enough
to hold the connection.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.018
- You didn't burn him out?
- No, I stopped.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.464
Derek, he wasn't strong enough
but he told me who was, Kaia.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.584
She's the key.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.379
- Where are you headed, miss?
- Anywhere.

but the artist was uncooperative.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.749
We tortured him.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.985
Eventually he told us
where Jack was headed.

To you.

Yeah, all right. Thank you.

We gotta find her fast.

About Mom. You were right.

This whole time,
we should've been looking for her.

Now that we do know.

you both thought that I could do that.

Yes.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.982
Exactly, like that.

you were in a dark place

where it's easy to cross over.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.067
I was taking Kaia to the Wind Caves.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.429
The Wind Caves?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.507
- Let's roll.
- No.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.343
We just saved your life in there.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.659
Thanks, but they only wanted me
because of you.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.784
Kaia, we need you to dreamwalk for us,

27:59.680 --> 28:00.863
to use your gift.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.380
It's not a gift, it's a curse.

28:04.440 --> 28:08.501
When Derek walked he was free,
he could gO see beautiful things.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.919
To worlds that were paradises.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.860
I wish it was like that for me,
but it's not.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.743
I only go to one place. The Bad Place.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.667
It's just blood and death, and monsters.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.066
Well, sounds like a lifetime
of bad dreams but...

28:24.160 --> 28:25.229
Bad dreams?

28:29.080 --> 28:30.502
When I get hurt over there,

28:30.600 --> 28:32.818
I don't wake up sweaty,
I wake up bloody.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.821
This scar, it's not the only one.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.826
I'm sorry about your mom
but I can't help you.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.177
All right, fine, we can find
another way, we, um...

28:51.160 --> 28:52.149
Get in the car.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.229
Dean.

28:54.760 --> 28:55.749
Dean?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.268
Get in the car.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.863
Get in the damn car!

29:14.760 --> 29:15.863
We're going to South Dakota.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.783
SO, now what?

29:42.680 --> 29:44.386
We get Kaia to the Wind Caves
and then what?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.345
Force her to dreamwalk at gunpoint?

29:46.680 --> 29:49.422
We get Mom back. NO matter what.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.704
Remember?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.506
JACK: I'm sorry about all of this.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.542
I was like you, Kaia,
afraid of my powers.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.945
But it doesn't have to be like that.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.663
You said that you wished
that things could've been different

30:17.400 --> 30:18.947
and that's why you reached out to Derek.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.382
Derek thought that you could help me

30:23.120 --> 30:24.747
and I could help you.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.159
Why do you keep saying his name?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.187
Derek's dead because of you.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.577
Five seconds.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.144
What?

30:36.240 --> 30:39.789
Give me five seconds to show you
what Derek saw,

30:40.080 --> 30:41.399
what I saw with him.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.380
It wasn't just the Bad Place,

30:44.560 --> 30:47.427
it was everything,

30:48.560 --> 30:50.380
it's amazing.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.663
Five seconds.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.503
(GASPS)

31:08.520 --> 31:09.589
(EXHALES)

31:18.680 --> 31:22.025
Our powers can be good.
We can do good in this world.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.024
(CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

31:37.040 --> 31:38.746
(TIREs SCREECHING)

31:46.160 --> 31:47.502
Oh, crap.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.305
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.300
Out, out. Jack, come on.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.741
- Hey.
-(DISTORTED SCREECHING)

32:19.120 --> 32:20.144
- Get them in the boat.
-(GROANS)

32:21.240 --> 32:23.982
Come on. Let's go, go, go.
Come on. Go.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.101
We need that boy, Dean Winchester.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.977
Heaven's running out of angels,
only he can save us.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.705
As far as I'm concerned,
you dicks can fry.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.506
Yes, well, you first.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.229
What's happening?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.421
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.024
We're screwed.
There's too damn many of them.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.949
We gotta gO up, let's go.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.462
DEAN: How long will this warding hold?

33:53.840 --> 33:54.829
I don't know.

34:18.520 --> 34:22.183
Hey, Dean, maybe if we let them in,
and then we blast them all away.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.622
No, they get in here, we're dead.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.189
Jack, can you do anything?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.703
I can try. But they'll hit me
with angel radio again.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.537
(RUMBLING)

34:35.320 --> 34:37.265
Okay, all right,
so then we go out guns blazing.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.188
We take out as many as we can.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.787
Kid? Sorry to drag you into this,
this was not your fight.

34:47.240 --> 34:50.027
If they get up here,
they'll kill you all and take me.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.429
No. They won't.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.102
You said I could help you find
the door to another world, right?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.509
Yes.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.180
Then let's do it. Let's get out of here.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.788
Hey, can you take us to our mom?

35:02.400 --> 35:03.389
Can you do it?

35:03.480 --> 35:04.617
I don't know, I think so.

35:04.920 --> 35:05.909
What if something goes wrong?

35:08.480 --> 35:10.903
Something already is going wrong.
Jack, do it.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.469
Are you ready?

35:20.200 --> 35:21.189
No.

35:21.840 --> 35:22.864
Let's go.

35:29.720 --> 35:30.823

Okay, I ’m there,
I ’m /n the Bad P/ace.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.143
Let go.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.789
I can't.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.780
Yes. You can.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.509
There.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.667
Dean, you gotta see this. Come here.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.982
DEAN: Jack, now!

36:55.080 --> 36:56.069
I see her.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.897
All right, they're almost through.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.458
No, focus.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.617
I'm losing it.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.906
Almost, almost.

(SCREAMING)

37:34.280 --> 37:35.542

Hey, Sam, could you call me back?

38:05.720 --> 38:06.823
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

38:07.240 --> 38:08.502
I just need to know you're Okay.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.669
Patience?

38:15.120 --> 38:17.543
Jody, I had a vision.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.508
Something bad's coming.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.468
- Hey.
- I'm good.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.024
(GROANS)

40:22.720 --> 40:23.709
Come on.
