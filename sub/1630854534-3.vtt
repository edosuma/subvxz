Do you think
he's smarter than most dogs?

00:31.720 --> 00:32.800
No.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
What?

00:33.880 --> 00:36.160
No, I think everyone just thinks
their dog's really smart.

Can I say something?
I have a confession to make.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.880
Yeah.
I never liked our kids.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.000
Nor did I.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.520
Yeah.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.840
Yeah, I mean, you can come back.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.000
Meggles doesn't mind.
Oh, OK.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.760
Meggles doesn't mind.
Oh, OK.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.240
Yeah, and also,
I'll come back for Colin.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.200
Hey, get out of it. Get out of it.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.640
Um...
What she doing?

09:07.680 --> 09:08.960
He was just sniffing that...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh.
..bag.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Mm-hm.
So, yeah.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.320
Yeah.
OK.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.480
Um...

09:14.680 --> 09:15.920
Also?
Mm.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.240
Can I just look at your phone?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.320
Mine's broken.
Yeah.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.520
I just want to see how long you...

09:19.560 --> 09:20.600
Oh, you texted me.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.320
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.600
What do you mean, doesn't matter?
Leave it.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.720
Anyway, it's just a...
Let me check it.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.760
..stupid message.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.000
Oh, my goodness, what are you doing?

09:27.040 --> 09:28.280
Don't take my phone!

09:28.320 --> 09:29.720
Just...Shh!

09:29.760 --> 09:31.640
Let me just...I'm so sorry.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.040
I just sent...I sent you something
and I just wanna delete it

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
'cause it's not important.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.800
What are you doing?
Can I please just have this?

09:36.840 --> 09:37.880
Give me my phone!
Leave it.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.480
Drop the phone.
Leave it. Just give it to me.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.120
Just give it to me. No.
Give me the phone.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.240
No. No.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.440
(PEGGY INHALES SHARPLY)

09:53.560 --> 09:54.760
Sorry, Peg.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.960
(MOUTHS SILENTLY) Just fuck off!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.080
Don't.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.320
(WHISPERS) I'm very sorry.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.000
You're out of control.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.480
You're out of control.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.040
Please just delete that text.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
I sent you a text and it was for...
It was just my mistake.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.600
How bad could it be?
It doesn't...forget it.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.440
It's not for you.
Look, man in a bath.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.600
No, no, no, no.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.880
Oh! Oh, my god.
What the fuck.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.280
Don't.
Oh, my god.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.720
(LAUGHS)

10:14.760 --> 10:17.480
Please don't laugh.
Don't laugh.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.880
Yes, it was an accident.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.520
Oh, my goodness, "He misses you"!

10:20.560 --> 10:22.280
Yes, it was an accident.
It was a complete accident.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.080
I was just taking a photo of him,
but...

10:24.120 --> 10:25.160
Oh!

10:25.200 --> 10:26.600
..it's a terrible angle
and I would...

10:26.640 --> 10:27.960
Don't show it to her!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.280
And I didn't...
I was taking a photo of the dog.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.120
But look, it's a terrible angle,
because the water actually acts

10:33.160 --> 10:35.160
as a lens
which fore shortens the object,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.280
which in this case is my dick.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
Don't!
Yeah.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.680
And if I were to send
a proper dick pic,

10:39.720 --> 10:41.320
and I have, it would be better.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.600
And mine is better than that.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.800
Sorry, what?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.560
Sorry, nothing.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.640
Nothing.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.120
I'm so sorry, Meggie... Peggles.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.200
Meggles.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.000
So, Gordon, here we are.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.080
Here we are.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.360
I take it you've read the pamphlet?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.360
Yes, I have.
Good man.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.920
What we are doing today
is a flexible cystoscopy.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.400
Mm-hm.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.440
And we are checking your bladder.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.520
OK. Fantastic.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.640
Men who have had testicular cancer

11:21.680 --> 11:24.960
are often at risk of developing
other cancers in the region...

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yep.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.200
..so it's best to check.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.400
Yep, fantastic.
Yeah?

11:28.440 --> 11:31.200
I'm going to insert something
nice and thin.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.280
Yep.
About the width of a pencil...

11:33.320 --> 11:34.320
Fuckin' hell.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.360
..up the old Urethra Franklin.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.800
(CHUCKLES) OK?

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
Alright.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.960
Whoa.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.640
Later on,
you may feel some discomfort

11:45.680 --> 11:47.520
with urinating,
and I wouldn't recommend

11:47.560 --> 11:49.400
inter course or masturbation.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.480
OK.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.000
If you must masturbate,
do it slowly and precisely.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.200
I...I won't.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.880
(CHUCKLES)

11:57.920 --> 12:00.000
Alright, good man.
No erections for you.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.640
Alright, good man.
No erections for you.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.200
That's the golden rule.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.920
Now, don't be frightened.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.680
Oh, Gordon.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.520
Handsome fellow. Lucky you, eh?
Thank you.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.680
We'll just have a little look.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.440
Permission to come aboard.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.720
Hold still.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.200
Yep, yep, yep. Ooh, ooh!

12:22.240 --> 12:25.080
And...we...are...

12:25.120 --> 12:26.920
Mm, mm, mm.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.600
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.680
DR ..in.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.760
Oh, no.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.040
What? What is it?

12:35.080 --> 12:38.120
Idiot's in the bunker. Sorry.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.240
Hey.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.840
Shh, Colin, shh.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.240
How is she going?

12:55.240 --> 12:56.640
Well, Palliative Care stopped by

12:56.680 --> 12:58.480
and they said it's any moment now.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.000
They gave her some more morphine.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.080
They gave her some more morphine.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.120
Megan, I'm so sorry.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.240
I'll...I'll just take Colin
and I'll get out of your hair.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.520
No, you don't have to.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.520
Yeah, we are drinking her
special occasion brandy.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.080
I don't want to intrude, honestly.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.560
My nan's dying.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.080
Drink with us.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.960
Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.240
You OK?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.760
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.760
Thanks.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.280
So, she showed you the photo, then?
Yeah. Good. Good.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.680
She explained the...
what was it?

13:46.720 --> 13:47.880
Foreshortening...

13:47.920 --> 13:49.560
Foreshortening.
..too, though, so don't worry.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.640
Yes. Ah, good.
Got all the details.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.880
It was...it was actually
a nice distraction, so...

13:56.920 --> 13:58.560
Well, glad to have helped.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.040
How's your pub?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.720
It's a microbrewery,
which is a little bit...

14:05.760 --> 14:07.920
But yeah, it's...it's...it's good.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.760
I mean, I say it's good.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.400
I was just in a car
sending an email to a journo

14:12.440 --> 14:14.040
to give him my mission statement

14:14.080 --> 14:16.640
about what I was hoping to achieve
with this whole endeavour.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.960
But he ordered a cider
at a microbrewery,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.320
which I think is a bit insane...

14:20.360 --> 14:21.880
Just take it down...
Sorry.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.720
(WHISPERS)Just...
Oh.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.800
It's...

14:24.840 --> 14:27.880
Nan? What is it?

14:30.480 --> 14:31.560
It's now.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.400
It's...it's now.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.000
Don't let the Japs in.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.120
Did she just...
Don't.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.840
She's gone.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.440
Hello! I'm here!

15:02.480 --> 15:03.760
Dad, we're in here!

15:07.960 --> 15:09.320
Am I too late?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.480
I'm so sorry, Dad.
You just missed her.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.920
(SOBS)

15:30.120 --> 15:31.560
Goodbye, Mother.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.240
Did she say anything?

15:40.280 --> 15:42.760
I...I don't think so.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.920
No.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.440
Thanks for coming, Ashy.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.000
She loved you very much.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.640
She loved you very much.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.040
I loved her.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.480
And you too, James.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.720
I know we haven't met, but...

16:05.760 --> 16:08.120
I'm so sorry, I'm not James.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.400
Sorry.
Um...

16:09.440 --> 16:13.240
Bernie, this is Gordon.
A friend.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.360
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.120
No, I'm sorry. I apologise.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.720
(BLOWS NOSE)

16:24.240 --> 16:28.600
Is that your lovely old
Toyota Cressida out the front?

16:28.640 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.440
Fantastic car.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.640
Thank you.
The '76?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.400
It's '78.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.480
Right.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.720
And manual, or...

16:38.760 --> 16:39.800
Automatic.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.880
Oh, it's a six cylinder.

16:41.920 --> 16:42.920
Yeah.
Mm.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.040
Three-speed auto.
It's a really great car.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.440
Very lucky.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.840
I am. Thank you.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.320
Thank you so much for saying it.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.160
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
I think we should go.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.800
Yes.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.000
I might head off.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.080
I might head off.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.640
Yeah, I might go too,
unless you need me for anything.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.720
No, it's fine.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.240
We'll just...we'll stay with her
for a while

17:05.280 --> 17:07.120
and make some calls and...

17:07.160 --> 17:08.400
Thanks for being here.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.160
Yeah. I love you.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.360
I'll call you.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.960
Love you, Bernie.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
Love you, Peg.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.040
Bye, Bern.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.400
Oh, Ash, can you thank
your mum for me, please?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.480
Why's that?

17:22.520 --> 17:24.440
She gave me a lift
from the airport just now.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.360
'Course she did.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.320
Oh, that was fucking devastating.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.440
Yeah.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.520
Jesus.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.520
I would murder a beer.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.040
Oh, thank shit. Yes.
Yeah.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.120
Let me take you to my place.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.840
Great.
I thought it was closed today.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.520
It is, but I sleep with the owner.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.480
Myself. I sleep with myself.
Right.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.640
Ah, why don't you follow me
and we'll open up.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.720
OK.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.000
How was it?
Oh!

18:00.000 --> 18:00.800
How was it?
Oh!

18:00.840 --> 18:01.920
Oh, Jesus.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.000
I felt her spirit
leave not long ago.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.640
I gave it a good energy.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.200
Did you?
I don't think you did.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.600
Just thought I might catch you.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.080
Just thought I'd say,
"Hey, girlfriend."

18:10.120 --> 18:12.760
But I actually told you
specifically not to come here.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
Do you know
how inappropriate this is?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.360
Bernie and I play Farmville,
so I reached out.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.560
Sue me.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.560
Gordon, don't leave me hanging.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.320
I added you on Facebook,
naughty boy.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.000
Ah, I will get onto that.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.320
You added...
I haven't added him on Facebook.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.640
That's really fucking weird.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.800
Goodbye, Gordon.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.080
Goodbye. Bye.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.160
Bye, Mum.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.280
Bye!

18:33.440 --> 18:34.680
Mum, are you leaving?

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
Mm-hm.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.800
Yeah, you're not going inside?

18:36.840 --> 18:37.920
Uh-uh.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.440
But are you going now?

18:39.480 --> 18:40.600
Yes, I'm going.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.560
Go on.

18:42.600 --> 18:46.440
Just need to...just to find...

18:46.480 --> 18:48.640
What are you pretending
to look for, Mum?

18:49.880 --> 18:52.080
Just go.
I wanna watch you physically leave.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.320
Off you pop.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.680
I just want to just go
and pay my respects.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.920
Just, well, yep.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.440
There's actually
a dead body in there, Mum.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.000
I know!
I'll be really quick.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
I know!
I'll be really quick.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.120
Mum, just go!

19:03.160 --> 19:04.720
Oh! Fine.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.280
Don't have children, Gordon.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.760
They only break your heart.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.760
OK. Bye, Ms Steinhart.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.080
Who's Ms Steinhart?
She is.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.680
Oh, she's going round the back.
Mum, I can see you!

19:15.720 --> 19:16.880
I've gotta follow her.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.280
# I'm looking down
On the bloodline #

19:28.320 --> 19:30.120
Ah...

19:30.160 --> 19:34.560
That's really something,
seeing someone die.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.960
Yeah, it is.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.200
I mean, it's very intimate, death,

19:40.240 --> 19:43.640
and I kind of can't believe that
she died with us there.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.480
Yeah.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.000
I mean, people normally
wait until they're alone.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.680
Do they?
Yeah.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.920
Like doctor pops
out for two minutes,

19:51.960 --> 19:53.600
comes back in, they're gone.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.960
Oh, my god, that's so sad.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.960
This is cool.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.080
Mm.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.400
What's with the barrels?
Do you make wine?

20:05.440 --> 20:08.680
Oh, no,
those are old bourbon barrels.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.320
We age the beer in there,

20:10.360 --> 20:12.960
because it gives the beer
this entirely different quality,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
depending on the character
of the bourbon that was in there,

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
the notes of that oak.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.600
So, only if you drink that beer

20:18.640 --> 20:21.640
from that barrel
will you have that experience.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.800
Oh, that's cool.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.040
Yeah.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.480
I mean, it's a bit nerdy, but...

20:25.520 --> 20:28.160
I like it. Mm.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.960
I think we're about to get
roasted in this review anyway, so...

20:33.120 --> 20:35.680
Well, remember what Peggy said.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.440
It's now.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.520
It is now.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.720
Eh? It's now.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.480
Also, don't let the Japs in.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.920
That was terrible.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.320
It was awful.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.400
(PHONE CHIMES)

20:51.160 --> 20:52.280
Oh, shit.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.480
What is it? What is it?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.720
He's posted the review.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.840
I can't...could you read that?

20:56.880 --> 20:57.960
Oh, OK.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.400
Please? And just be gentle.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.960
Oh, no.
What?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.280
I can't read.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.520
Don't!
No, I'm kidding.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.840
I'm an excellent reader.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.560
In Year 3, they said I...
OK, could you read it?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.080
OK, sorry. OK

21:11.120 --> 21:13.800
Um...oh, Gordon!
What?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.720
"It's time
for a change of the guard.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.720
"The days of the old pubs
on the corner

21:17.760 --> 21:21.720
"filled with men leering at women
over warm VB are over.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.960
"These run down, piss-soaked dives

21:24.000 --> 21:26.640
"are being replaced by
establishments like Echo Park."

21:26.680 --> 21:27.760
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.280
Oh! Oh, that's amazing!

21:30.320 --> 21:32.960
He gets it!
Oh, yes! Fuck yes!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.840
He gets it.
Come here. Congrats.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.960
Thank you.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.400
(LAUGHS) Great.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.160
Alright!

21:42.200 --> 21:43.240
Yeah.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.440
Alright!

21:44.480 --> 21:45.600
How about that.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.280
I mean, whatever.
Who cares, anyway.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.360
You care.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.160
I care quite a bit, yeah.
Yeah.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.240
That's a relief.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.480
Cheers.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.000
Real talk?

22:00.000 --> 22:00.240
Real talk?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.880
Yeah, I think we can real talk.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.840
Why do you think you're single?

22:06.080 --> 22:07.480
Wow.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.000
It's just that you've got
such a nice

22:10.040 --> 22:14.040
bar and good hair.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.240
Why do you think you're single?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.160
Well, I'm newly single,
so I'm not...

22:17.200 --> 22:18.280
I don't really know yet.

22:18.320 --> 22:22.080
But I get the feeling that
you're quite...single.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.280
How come?

22:23.320 --> 22:24.400
The unicycle.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.520
And the punching bag.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.480
Wow, man, you buy one unicycle...

22:28.520 --> 22:31.080
And the stationary bike.
And the drums.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.480
Yeah, look,
I mean, I don't know is the answer.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.600
I...

22:37.640 --> 22:40.760
I really,
I just work most of the time.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.320
I mean, I'm on all the dating apps.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.840
I'm on all the apps.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.960
I don't know,
maybe...maybe I just...

22:46.000 --> 22:47.160
It just feels a bit empty to me.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.440
Maybe I'm expecting too much.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.360
Do you do the old

22:53.400 --> 22:56.720
"I sleep with the owner
personal beer tasting" move much?

22:57.760 --> 23:00.000
It's not a move...
I don't...it's not a move.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.960
It's not a move...
I don't...it's not a move.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.560
This is not a move?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.800
Oh, my god.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.000
Is it working?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.600
No.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.120
Yeah.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.440
Yeah, I'm just kidding.
Come here.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.400
# This is the last time

23:19.440 --> 23:21.920
# The last time I call... #

23:21.960 --> 23:24.080
It always works.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.480
Always does.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.000
Paying for itself.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.000
# The last time I call #

23:36.560 --> 23:38.280
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
Yes. Yes!

23:48.680 --> 23:51.000
Ahh! Stop, stop, stop, stop.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.360
What!
We can't do this.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.440
Why not? What's happened?

23:54.480 --> 23:55.760
You've got your thirty days
of sexless.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.040
Oh, I...
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no...

23:57.080 --> 23:58.400
No, I don't care.
No, no, I care.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.640
Ooh!
I care.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.000
(TO HIMSELF) Oh, fuck.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.720
(TO HIMSELF) Oh, fuck.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.160
What is going on?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.880
Um, honestly,
you've had a lot to drink,

24:04.920 --> 24:06.040
I've had a lot to drink.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.480
I...I consent...

24:07.520 --> 24:08.960
No, no, I...I don't
want to take advantage.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.480
You're not, man, honestly.
Honestly.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.640
I consent...I consent to it all.
I'm all good.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.640
I understand that
now is a different time,

24:14.680 --> 24:16.040
you know, and I respect that.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.720
I'm on board with that.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.320
Well, I'm not on board with that.

24:19.360 --> 24:23.040
If we do it sober,
it will mean more.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.840
I don't know what you're saying.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.080
I don't want to ruin the friendship.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.320
I wanna build on it.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.080
You know what?

24:31.120 --> 24:34.720
I might just have a shower
and might just hit the hay.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.960
I have had a good night.

24:38.520 --> 24:42.480
# Well, I'm gonna
Get myself together

24:42.520 --> 24:47.120
# Around the kitchen table
Some day soon

24:47.160 --> 24:52.200
# And maybe now that
I'm a little older

24:52.240 --> 24:55.920
# I might tell myself the truth

24:55.960 --> 25:00.000
# That I'm always thinking of ya

25:00.000 --> 25:00.640
# That I'm always thinking of ya

25:00.680 --> 25:06.240
# Yeah, I'm always thinking of you

25:06.280 --> 25:10.520
# And if I try to think it over

25:10.560 --> 25:13.680
# I'll name myself a fool... #

25:17.440 --> 25:18.880
(TO HERSELF)
What the fuck was that?

25:20.960 --> 25:23.920
# I'm gonna get myself together

25:23.960 --> 25:25.120
# And make a mends

25:25.160 --> 25:27.440
# For all that I've done wrong. #

25:27.480 --> 25:30.480
