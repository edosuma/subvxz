01:47.867 --> 01:51.266
- Ah, competition brings out
the best in people.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.200
That's what they say.

01:53.266 --> 01:54.533
When the game
is on the line,

01:54.600 --> 01:56.433
a true sportsman
wants the outcome

01:56.500 --> 01:57.834
to rest on his shoulders.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.433
The logic being,
you make the winning play,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.100
you walk away a hero.

02:02.166 --> 02:03.900
Of course,
if you fuck up,

02:03.967 --> 02:05.333
you're the goat.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.367
The problem with
competition here in Oz is...

02:09.433 --> 02:11.133
we mostly got goats.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.333
male announcer: Please welcome
a new contestant,

02:14.400 --> 02:16.133
Joanie Kennedy.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.867
And you are gonna
be helped by a man

02:17.934 --> 02:19.834
who's done just about
everything, Bill Boggs.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.533
How are you, Bill?
- Good to see you, Gordon.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.800
- Okay, let's play the game
and the category is sports.

02:23.867 --> 02:24.967
The question is this:

02:25.033 --> 02:26.567
in basketball, Joanie,

02:26.633 --> 02:30.000
what does it mean when
a referee makes this motion?

02:30.066 --> 02:33.900
- He wants to do the Hustle?

02:34.934 --> 02:38.333
-  Sorry,
I don't follow basketball.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.300
I'm more into...

02:50.567 --> 02:52.266
- How you feeling there, Omar?

02:54.066 --> 02:55.300
I'm feeling pretty good.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.100
- Really?

02:57.166 --> 02:59.533
I still feel all kinds
of aches and pains

02:59.600 --> 03:01.767
from when you stabbed me.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.633
- Well, you know,
I'm sorry about that.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.567
- Oh, you're sorry?
- Yeah.

03:09.934 --> 03:11.333
I'm sorry you didn't die.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.633
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

03:18.834 --> 03:20.400
Whoa! Whoa!

03:20.467 --> 03:22.567
Whoa!

03:26.400 --> 03:29.066
- Prisoner #96G522...
- Full of shit, man.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.900
Motherfucker.
- Carmen Guerra.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.433
AKA Chico.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.900
Convicted June 4th, 1996,

03:35.967 --> 03:37.233
murder in the first degree.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.867
Sentence: 53 years.

03:39.934 --> 03:42.700
Up for parole in '17.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.300
- Yo, McManus.
I gotta talk to you, man.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.834
Later.
- It's about your pet project--

03:45.900 --> 03:48.166
Omar White.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.500
- What about him?

03:49.567 --> 03:51.066
- He's still a tit man.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.667
- And you feel compelled
to tell me this

03:52.734 --> 03:54.633
out of some need
to save his soul?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.867
- Look, he shanked you
and he shanked me,

03:56.934 --> 03:59.667
and it's only a matter of time
before he shanks someone else.

03:59.734 --> 04:02.266
You shake him down,
you'll find drugs.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
- Shakedown!

04:14.467 --> 04:15.867
Lookie, lookie.

04:15.934 --> 04:17.133
- You ain't gonna find shit!

04:21.000 --> 04:23.100
- Ooh!
- There you go.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.166
- You fuckin' rat, Guerra.
- That's what you get.

04:25.233 --> 04:27.400
- Ooh...

04:27.467 --> 04:31.133
- Fucking cabron.
- Ah, fuck.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.934
- Double play.
- Fuckin' asshole...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.300
- Yellow rat,
motherfucking punk!

04:37.367 --> 04:39.367
Bastard!
- Put Mr. Guerra in the cage.

04:39.433 --> 04:40.767
Take Mr. White upstairs.

04:40.834 --> 04:43.567
- Fucking yellow
rat bastard punk!

04:43.633 --> 04:46.567
Pussy!

04:46.633 --> 04:48.533
- Pussies.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.934
- We had an agreement.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.266
No drugs.
- I know.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.834
- So tell me why I shouldn't
FedEx your ass

04:54.900 --> 04:57.066
back to Solitary.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.767
- There is no reason.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.867
It's that when it come--
comes to tits,

05:00.934 --> 05:03.533
I'm just a little shaky,
man.

05:05.734 --> 05:08.233
I mean,
God knows I try.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.300
I try.

05:10.367 --> 05:12.967
But the temptation,

05:13.033 --> 05:16.333
it just grows and grows...

05:16.400 --> 05:18.300
till I can't help it.
I just...

05:18.367 --> 05:19.767
I just gotta
shove that shit

05:19.834 --> 05:20.900
where it don't belong.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.734
- You really think
I'm a bubble head, don't you?

05:30.266 --> 05:31.633
- Sir?
- Well, you make

05:31.700 --> 05:33.000
that sorrowful face,

05:33.066 --> 05:34.367
you say what you think
I wanna hear.

05:34.433 --> 05:36.433
You're full of shit, Omar!

05:37.500 --> 05:40.133
And you can try
my patience only so far.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.300
Now, Sister Pete says
you've been inconsistent

05:42.367 --> 05:44.233
about going to rehab.
- No, I--

05:44.300 --> 05:46.867
- There is a session
at 1:00 today.

05:46.934 --> 05:48.166
Fuckin' be there.

05:52.433 --> 05:53.834
- Let's go.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.667
- The key--the key
is to fill the time

06:00.734 --> 06:03.266
you would use doing drugs
with something else.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.867
- Like busting McManus' ass
in basketball, okay.

06:08.233 --> 06:10.000
- Yeah, well, activities
are good, but, I mean,

06:10.066 --> 06:12.133
that doesn't change
one basic fact, you know.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.433
You're not gonna quit
unless you wanna quit.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.400
You know, you have to hit rock
bottom before you can crawl out.

06:18.467 --> 06:21.300
- Why are you looking at me
when you say that?

06:21.367 --> 06:22.600
- Well, I wasn't
saying it to you.

06:22.667 --> 06:23.633
I was saying it
to the group.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.567
- What, you...

06:25.633 --> 06:28.967
You think you're better than me
'cause you quit and I can't?

06:29.033 --> 06:31.066
- Omar...

06:31.133 --> 06:33.734
- You ain't better than me,
you fucking punk-ass white boy.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.800
Instead of snorting,
you've been sucking cock.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.033
- That's enough, Omar!

06:37.100 --> 06:38.567
- You wanna suck this,
motherfucker?

06:44.133 --> 06:45.900
- Hey, hey, hey!

06:45.967 --> 06:48.233
- Listen, listen!

06:59.900 --> 07:01.367
- Got no game...

07:01.433 --> 07:02.600
- What you gonna do,

07:02.667 --> 07:04.066
come over here
and scratch me again?

07:04.133 --> 07:06.100
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- Got you. Got you, Chapman.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.400
You piece of shit.
- Poet, the greatest

07:07.467 --> 07:08.633
of all time!

07:08.700 --> 07:11.300
Take care.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.033
- As a rule, I don't
give up on people,

07:16.100 --> 07:19.633
but this guy, Omar,
may be the exception.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.133
- White!

07:29.767 --> 07:33.300
- I know.
I fucked up again.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.834
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.400
- All the bullshit aside...

07:38.300 --> 07:39.900
I want...

07:39.967 --> 07:42.867
I want to own my own mind.

07:42.934 --> 07:44.600
- Look...

07:46.100 --> 07:50.300
I don't know why
I think I can help you,

07:50.367 --> 07:53.133
but I'm not giving up
on you, Omar.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.700
You understand?
I'm not giving up.

07:57.367 --> 07:58.900
- Thank you.

08:08.233 --> 08:10.333
- Oh, you fucking bastard!

08:10.400 --> 08:13.967
I hope you die in here,
you motherfucking bastard!

08:14.033 --> 08:16.333
I hope you rot in hell!

08:16.400 --> 08:19.266
You killed my baby!

08:23.100 --> 08:26.233
- The parole board has set
the hearing for next Wednesday.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.900
If all goes
according to Hoyle,

08:27.967 --> 08:31.066
Tobias, you could be out of Oz
by the end of the month.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.700
- Have Kathy Rockwell's parents
been made aware of the hearing?

08:33.767 --> 08:35.200
- Probably not.

08:35.266 --> 08:37.300
In most cases, it's the
responsibility of the victim

08:37.367 --> 08:39.066
or the victim's family
to stay informed.

08:39.133 --> 08:42.200
- Well, I want you
to tell them.

08:42.266 --> 08:44.000
- That's not advisable.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.700
If they ask to testify,
Kathy's parents

08:45.767 --> 08:47.700
could sway the board
away from paroling you.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.834
- Until my son was killed,
I never fully understood

08:49.900 --> 08:51.600
what I've done
to those two people.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.000
I can't go back into the world
knowing that I snuck out.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.600
The Rockwells are as much a part
of my prison term as anyone.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.967
They have a right
to be heard.

09:01.033 --> 09:02.600
- Okay, I'll phone them.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.066
But first,
before the parole hearing,

09:05.133 --> 09:07.533
I'm going to ask them to
have an interaction with you.

09:09.867 --> 09:13.133
- Katherine, I hope you
understand why I'm doing this.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.834
- As a lawyer,
I think you're insane.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.166
But as a mother...

09:23.734 --> 09:25.767
I think
you got balls for days.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.533
- Last time we saw each other,
Mrs. Rockwell,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.100
I didn't say much.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.834
- You didn't say anything.
- Yeah.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.333
Well, that's because
I was on drugs,

09:43.400 --> 09:45.734
and I was confused,

09:45.800 --> 09:47.400
full of self-loathing.

09:47.467 --> 09:50.233
- And now you've
forgiven yourself?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.667
- No. What I did
to your daughter

09:52.734 --> 09:54.900
will shadow me forever,

09:54.967 --> 09:56.867
just as being in Oz will.

09:56.934 --> 09:59.800
What's happened to me
in here...

10:03.467 --> 10:08.967
Well, whether I've suffered
enough to satisfy you,

10:09.033 --> 10:11.166
I don't know.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.934
- When you were
sentenced to 15 years,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.533
I was stunned.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.000
15 lousy years doesn't equal
the lifetime my daughter lost.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.834
You say you've suffered,

10:25.900 --> 10:27.834
and I say I'm glad.

10:30.567 --> 10:35.033
- When the lawyer came to
talk about my being paroled,

10:35.100 --> 10:38.266
she said that because of
extenuating circumstances,

10:38.333 --> 10:40.967
the board...

10:41.033 --> 10:42.567
might look kindly on me.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.333
- Why don't you explain
the circumstances?

10:52.900 --> 10:55.333
- Since I've been inside,

10:55.400 --> 10:57.233
my son was murdered

10:57.300 --> 10:59.567
and my wife
may have been,

10:59.633 --> 11:03.000
both as a result
of things I did in here.

11:04.734 --> 11:07.700
It's ironic that

11:07.767 --> 11:12.166
I came to Oz walking across
the grave of your daughter

11:12.233 --> 11:16.000
and I may leave walking across
the graves of my own family.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.533
If they had lived,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.066
I wouldn't have the chance
at going free.

11:25.166 --> 11:28.333
- When I saw you
four years ago,

11:28.400 --> 11:32.567
the pain of Kathy's death
was still so new.

11:32.633 --> 11:35.800
Dave and I...

11:35.867 --> 11:38.400
grieved and grieved
and grieved.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.533
We still do.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.734
But the sorrow
is balanced with joy.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.500
We have another child,
Richard,

11:45.567 --> 11:47.300
and he's growing up
to be remarkable.

11:51.233 --> 11:54.100
We've come to believe
that even though

11:54.166 --> 11:57.934
we don't understand
why Kathy's gone...

11:59.867 --> 12:02.667
We accept her death
as part of some...

12:04.200 --> 12:05.667
Wise plan.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.667
I don't know
if you've suffered enough.

12:09.734 --> 12:11.767
That's not up to me
to decide.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.233
Only God can.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.767
We will not interfere
with your parole.

12:32.367 --> 12:33.934
- Vince Lombardi
once said that,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.934
"Winning isn't everything,
it's the only thing."

12:37.000 --> 12:40.200
But the one thing Lombardi held
in higher regard than winning

12:40.266 --> 12:41.667
was character.

12:41.734 --> 12:44.467
In fact, without character,
there'd be no victory.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.300
Now, don't get me wrong.

12:46.367 --> 12:47.867
Some of his players
would miss curfew,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.567
cad around, get jiggy,

12:49.633 --> 12:51.700
but they always knew
where to draw the line.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.166
That's right.

12:53.233 --> 12:56.934
A good man knows
where to draw the line.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.133
Mm!

13:03.100 --> 13:06.900
- Robson, you are
one ugly motherfucker.

13:06.967 --> 13:10.000
- I don't see you modeling
in Milan, you black bitch.

13:10.066 --> 13:12.900
- Hey, shut the fuck up,
I'm trying to masturbate!

13:12.967 --> 13:14.834
- Fuck you, Alvarez!

13:14.900 --> 13:17.000
- Quiet!
Warden's on deck.

13:17.066 --> 13:19.867
- Yo, yo, Glynn.

13:19.934 --> 13:21.166
Yo, I need an appointment,
motherfucker.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.533
- Glynn,
you get me excited!

13:22.600 --> 13:24.333
Why don't you hold my dick?

13:25.767 --> 13:27.500
- We need to talk alone.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.233
- Did you frisk him?
- Yes, sir.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.166
- Okay.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.000
- You actually think
I'd shank you?

13:35.066 --> 13:37.667
- I have no idea what
you're capable of anymore.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.533
- I'm stunned.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.000
I mean, here you are,
a man feared by

13:41.066 --> 13:43.333
all the prisoners in Oz,
afraid of me.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.467
Wow.
- What do you want?

13:45.533 --> 13:48.300
- I've decided to confess
to the murder of John Basil,

13:48.367 --> 13:50.400
and I intend to ask
for the death penalty.

13:50.467 --> 13:53.266
- So that you can die
a martyr.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.100
- I've written
a manifesto...

13:56.166 --> 13:59.500
I want published
the day I'm executed.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.934
- Where'd you get the paper?
Officer Smith!

14:03.934 --> 14:05.867
Under no circumstances
is this prisoner

14:05.934 --> 14:07.767
to be allowed paper.
- Leo, it's--

14:07.834 --> 14:09.533
- You wanna destroy
yourself, fine.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.000
But I'm not gonna
make it easy for you.

14:12.066 --> 14:13.633
- Goddamn motherfucker!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.633
Oh, don't go away,
Uncle Tom.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.000
Don't go away.
Don't leave me like this, baby.

14:28.066 --> 14:31.166
Don't leave me like this!
Don't leave me like this, baby!

14:31.233 --> 14:32.700
- Carl Jenkins is dead.

14:32.767 --> 14:35.767
You got no case against me.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.734
I want out of here,
Glynn.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.233
I want out of here, Glynn!

14:39.300 --> 14:40.567
I want out!

14:40.633 --> 14:42.033
I want a fucking lawyer!

14:42.100 --> 14:43.633
Get me fucking Said!

14:43.700 --> 14:44.734
That's the lawyer I need!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.200
You motherfucker!

14:46.266 --> 14:49.233
Get me out of here!

14:49.300 --> 14:51.233
- I don't want to release
Robson from Solitary

14:51.300 --> 14:53.166
any more than you do,
but I got no choice.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.066
Carl Jenkins
committed suicide.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.800
A good defense attorney

14:56.867 --> 14:58.367
could shoot holes
through his testimony.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.033
And without his testimony,
we got no case against Robson.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.967
- So you're gonna put him
back into Gen Pop

15:03.033 --> 15:05.400
even though he masterminded
the death of Salah Udeen

15:05.467 --> 15:08.300
and he has vowed
to kill me too?

15:08.367 --> 15:09.900
- I'm afraid so.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.934
Since we can't prove
Robson's guilt,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.233
keeping him in Solitary
would be unjust.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.633
- Now why is it
that justice

15:16.700 --> 15:18.767
only works in
somebody else's favor?

15:29.633 --> 15:31.066
Arif, help me.

15:31.133 --> 15:34.633
I have such rage
inside of me,

15:34.700 --> 15:37.266
rage unlike
I've ever known.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.834
- You've always been able
to control such emotions.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.166
- I don't think
I can do that much longer.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.767
I feel like I'm possessed.

15:44.834 --> 15:48.633
- Pray to Allah.
- Pray?

15:48.700 --> 15:53.166
I pray and I pray
and nothing.

15:54.367 --> 15:58.467
- Yo, sorry about what
happened to Leroy Tidd...

15:58.533 --> 16:00.367
or Ooga Booga,

16:00.433 --> 16:02.000
whatever the fuck
you call him.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.800
Say nigger! You want to see
the nigger in me?

16:09.867 --> 16:13.667
You want to see
the nigger in me? Ah!

16:34.400 --> 16:37.600
- Fucking...
Motherfucker.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.633
Fucking cock--motherfucker.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.166
Fucking nigger!

16:41.233 --> 16:42.867
- The Aryans
must be punished.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.800
We will no longer
tolerate their actions.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.033
From this moment on,
we are all on point.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.367
Nobody goes anywhere
alone.

16:49.433 --> 16:51.133
- Said's nigger ass
is in the hole.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.467
Looks like Arif's in charge.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.767
These fuckers are more
pissed off than ever.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.600
I want you guys to watch
each other's back.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.033
Carry weapons
whenever you can.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.033
- Payback time.
- This shit's gonna go down

17:01.100 --> 17:03.166
real soon.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.200
The fuck is this all about?

17:05.266 --> 17:07.700
- Father Mukada
loaned me his office.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.200
The Warden wants me
to speak with you.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.767
He fears that there will be
an escalation of hostilities

17:12.834 --> 17:15.367
between your people
and the Muslims.

17:15.433 --> 17:16.967
Sit down, please.

17:17.033 --> 17:20.000
- The hacks have good reason
to fear, Preacher.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.467
So do you.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.433
-  You feel that
I have wronged you

17:23.500 --> 17:26.333
by getting Carl Jenkins
to testify against Robson.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
But I assure you,
what I did,

17:28.467 --> 17:30.333
I did in
the name of justice.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.900
- No, what you did you did
'cause Robson got pissed

17:32.967 --> 17:34.867
when you tried to turn me
into a psalm singer.

17:34.934 --> 17:38.033
- Ohh, I never imagined
that you would convert.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.767
I simply wanted you to know
a little joy in your life,

17:41.834 --> 17:43.633
the birth
of your grandchild.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.467
- Yeah, if she is
my grandchild.

17:49.934 --> 17:52.533
You ever talk to that woman
in your congregation?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.200
- Sarah, yes.

17:54.266 --> 17:56.433
She and Carrie have had
numerous conversations,

17:56.500 --> 17:58.734
and at no time did Carrie
say anything about

17:58.800 --> 18:00.400
having been a prostitute.

18:00.467 --> 18:01.867
- Sarah ask her directly?

18:01.934 --> 18:03.367
- No.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.800
- Well, then you've proved
nothing either way.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.166
- When are you gonna
see this girl again?

18:08.233 --> 18:09.967
- In an hour.

18:10.033 --> 18:13.633
- Unless the Warden puts
the entire prison in lockdown.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.667
If I could assure him that
at least for the time being

18:17.734 --> 18:21.367
there will be
no immediate trouble,

18:21.433 --> 18:24.000
maybe Warden Glynn
will reconsider.

18:25.633 --> 18:28.000
- Got yourself a deal.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.633
- Hi, Mr. Schillinger.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.667
Ooh, what happened
to your face?

18:38.734 --> 18:40.467
- Oh, nothing, it's fine.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.667
- There we are,
all nice and dry.

18:45.734 --> 18:49.533
Hey, you ready to
play with Grandpa? Huh?

18:49.600 --> 18:52.000
- Yeah, that--that's okay.

18:52.066 --> 18:53.367
- Something wrong?

18:53.433 --> 18:56.734
- I'm gonna ask you
some serious questions,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.300
and I want you to talk true.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.467
- Okay.

19:01.533 --> 19:04.367
- Put the baby down.

19:04.433 --> 19:05.700
- It's okay.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.667
It's okay, Jewel.

19:09.133 --> 19:10.900
Oh, sweetie.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.900
- It's come to my attention
that you worked the streets,

19:12.967 --> 19:14.233
hooking.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.533
I can see it's true.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.500
- Hank said we needed money--
- All right, I don't

19:20.567 --> 19:22.700
wanna hear that part.

19:22.767 --> 19:25.734
What's important is,
whose child is that?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.633
She's not Hank's, is she?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.333
You knew that the day
you showed up here!

19:30.400 --> 19:31.900
- Mr. Schillinger,
I swear...

19:31.967 --> 19:33.700
when the doctor told me
I was pregnant,

19:33.767 --> 19:35.734
I counted backwards,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.633
trying to figure out
who the father was.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.934
On the day
the baby was conceived,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.900
I had sex with
three different men, okay?

19:46.967 --> 19:49.500
Two out-of-town
salesmen and Hank.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.734
So the truth is,

19:53.800 --> 19:55.900
I don't know
which one was the father.

19:55.967 --> 19:57.900
I'm not sure.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.266
Except, stare at her face...

20:03.533 --> 20:05.767
Don't she look like Hank?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.900
Don't she?

20:20.033 --> 20:22.200
- It's okay.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.200
- Okay, Cloutier's
gotten Schillinger

20:31.266 --> 20:32.900
to agree not to retaliate,

20:32.967 --> 20:34.433
so he's gonna keep
his boy Robson in check.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.033
I need your assurance that
the Muslims will cooperate.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.967
- No.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.667
- No. No, what?
You won't cooperate?

20:40.734 --> 20:43.400
- No, I can't assure you
of anything, McManus,

20:43.467 --> 20:46.800
least of all the good behavior
of my people...

20:46.867 --> 20:48.600
or myself.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.166
'Cause, you see,
what's been going on

20:50.233 --> 20:53.066
has been going on
and will go on

20:53.133 --> 20:55.934
till long after you, me,
and Schillinger are all dead.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.834
- My only concern
is right now.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.266
- Yeah, well,
that's not surprising

20:59.333 --> 21:00.967
because you always
did take the short view.

21:01.033 --> 21:03.433
- Ah, maybe you need
another couple days in here!

21:03.500 --> 21:05.767
- Yeah, maybe I do!

21:05.834 --> 21:08.800
- Fuck you.
- Go ahead, get out!

21:10.700 --> 21:13.400
Oh!

21:13.467 --> 21:15.133
- If athletes learned
to control their tempers,

21:15.200 --> 21:17.200
to control their rage,

21:17.266 --> 21:19.700
then hockey players wouldn't
do time in the penalty box,

21:19.767 --> 21:22.767
basketball players wouldn't
draw technical fouls,

21:22.834 --> 21:26.100
football players wouldn't
be penalized 15 yards.

21:26.166 --> 21:29.500
Of course, if athletes
did control their rage,

21:29.567 --> 21:32.233
nobody'd be interested
in sports.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.800
The punching, choking,
kicking, biting, screaming.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.900
That's what
the fans go to see.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.233
- What are you doing?

21:55.300 --> 21:57.567
It's 7:00 a.m. Game two
is not till this afternoon.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.400
- Yeah, I wanted
to work on my shot.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.467
I'm still haunted by
those fucking air balls

22:01.533 --> 22:02.867
I threw up last game.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.200
- Don't beat yourself up.

22:04.266 --> 22:06.133
I mean, I couldn't
get much going, either.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.734
- Yeah.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.867
What do you think of Vahue?

22:10.934 --> 22:13.200
- The guy's a stone bitch.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.600
A strong, tough,
talented player.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.900
- That's funny.

22:16.967 --> 22:20.200
That's what I said about you.
- Huh?

22:20.266 --> 22:22.967
- Well, maybe not
in those exact words.

22:24.233 --> 22:27.533
A friend of mine's a scout
with the Sacramento Kings.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.934
I told him about you.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.266
Says he wants to take a look.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.233
- A look?
- Yeah, today.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.967
- Hey, yo, you got
them two dunks off the bat,

22:44.033 --> 22:47.533
I was, like, oh, shit,
the fat lady's singing.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.767
- Hey, yo, man, seconds.

22:52.834 --> 22:55.100
And...
special stash.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.300
- Oh, shit.

22:56.367 --> 22:59.133
-  All right?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.367
Hey, yo, man,
this guy Brass, man,

23:01.433 --> 23:02.834
he's some fucking talent,
huh?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.867
- Oh, fuck that.
- Nah, uh-uh,

23:04.934 --> 23:06.700
that motherfucker can play.

23:06.767 --> 23:08.567
I'm too big for him, though.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:08.633 --> 23:10.600
- You know game two
gonna go like game one.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.800
It'll stay close...

23:12.867 --> 23:14.066
as long as I let it.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.533
- You hearing this?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.033
- Yeah, it's true.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.433
Vahue's a wide body.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.567
There's no way
to guard him.

23:25.633 --> 23:27.867
There's no way for McManus
and Brass to win.

23:33.834 --> 23:34.867
Hey, Vahue.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.033
Go back and get your tray.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.066
- Oh, I got that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.467
He buses his own tray.

23:44.533 --> 23:46.066
- Yo, fuck that.

23:48.633 --> 23:50.433
- Oh, shit!
- Back the fuck up!

23:50.500 --> 23:51.900
Back the fuck up!

23:51.967 --> 23:54.767
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

23:54.834 --> 23:58.000
- Damn, you broke my knee!

23:58.066 --> 23:59.900
- Well, say something.

23:59.967 --> 24:02.367
- Vahue brought
the situation on himself.

24:02.433 --> 24:05.767
We were by the book,
McManus.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.767
- All right, let me know
if it's too tight.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.033
- Is it my ACL?
- No, your ACL is fine.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.700
It's just,
your knee's badly swollen.

24:11.767 --> 24:13.567
You should stay off it
a few days.

24:13.633 --> 24:14.900
- We'll push the game
back a week.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.500
- Oh, 'cause you care
about me, right?

24:16.567 --> 24:19.233
- No, I just want
your best game.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.533
- What, you still think
you gonna win?

24:20.600 --> 24:21.734
- You know, like I said,

24:21.800 --> 24:23.834
the ball bounces
the right way, who knows?

24:27.633 --> 24:29.266
- So you're telling me
I ain't got any damage?

24:29.333 --> 24:31.800
- None that I can see.

24:31.867 --> 24:33.867
- Then I'ma see you
in the gym, then.

24:33.934 --> 24:36.166
Tell your boy,
bring his A game too.

- Hey, Vahue.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.867
Yeah, not.

26:31.934 --> 26:34.633
- You fucking
let us down, Vahue.

26:34.700 --> 26:38.200
- I had a lot of money
bet on that game, cocksucker.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.700
- Tug, let me get the chair.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.033
- Nah, man. I'm using it.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.433
- No, for real, dude.
I need to sit down

26:45.500 --> 26:47.467
and elevate this leg,
man, come on.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.934
- Yo, I'm out, man.
- I'm with you.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.200
- Hey, yo, Poet.

27:03.266 --> 27:04.533
Look, man, at dinner,

27:04.600 --> 27:06.467
how about I get some more
of that Gatorade?

27:06.533 --> 27:08.433
- Man, I don't know,
Jackson, I don't know.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.900
- I'm dehydrated, man.
I lost a lot of water today.

27:10.967 --> 27:13.300
- I'll see what I can do,
but it's a tall order.

27:27.867 --> 27:29.166
- Look, it's simple.

27:29.233 --> 27:30.867
In three weeks,
I want you to come out

27:30.934 --> 27:32.567
to our rookie camp.
- Oh, Jesus.

27:32.633 --> 27:36.633
- No guarantees, but I think
you can make our club.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.367
- Congratulations.
- Ohh.

27:38.433 --> 27:39.800
- I gotta go.
Somebody from player personnel

27:39.867 --> 27:40.900
will contact you.

27:40.967 --> 27:42.233
And one last thing.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.967
I don't want to tell you
not to play pick-up games

27:44.033 --> 27:45.834
and, you know, this thing
you and Tim got going,

27:45.900 --> 27:48.700
but use your head, all right?

27:48.767 --> 27:51.400
All right, stay strong.

27:57.667 --> 28:00.600
I'll still play.
- I can't ask you to do that.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.333
- I know how much you wanna
win that last game.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.567
- I'll find someone else.

28:03.633 --> 28:05.633
- Tim.
- I'll find someone.

28:19.033 --> 28:20.467
- Fuck.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.433
- There he goes now,
the luckiest man on the planet.

28:24.967 --> 28:28.800
- Lucky?
- Correction: formerly lucky.

28:28.867 --> 28:30.867
The word's out, McManus.

28:30.934 --> 28:33.500
That scout today
came to scoop up your boy.

28:33.567 --> 28:35.834
He's on his way to the Kings.
- Mm-hmm.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.300
- And without Brass,

28:37.367 --> 28:38.867
you're gonna look
pretty fucking foolish.

28:38.934 --> 28:41.100
I bet you'd lose by...

28:41.166 --> 28:43.066
50, 60 points.

28:43.133 --> 28:44.967
- Well, who says
I'm without him?

28:53.033 --> 28:54.633
- I thought Dave Brass
wasn't playing.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.967
- He's not.
- So what was that all about?

28:57.033 --> 28:59.033
- I couldn't stomach
giving Morales the satisfaction.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.133
I'll get it soon enough.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.600
- Hey, Martinez.

29:09.667 --> 29:10.900
- Hola, mi hermano.

29:10.967 --> 29:12.266
- Hey, the Warden still
got you over in Unit B?

29:12.333 --> 29:14.033
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.467
I need an ask.
- Ask.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.734
- They said deep-baller Brass...

29:19.800 --> 29:20.834
- Okay.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.033
Oh, shit! Fuck!

29:43.166 --> 29:44.633
Fuck!
- Easy, easy, easy!

29:44.700 --> 29:46.200
Stay there. All right,
all right, I got you.

29:46.266 --> 29:48.934
Easy, easy! God damn it,
I said--why's he still there?

29:54.533 --> 29:56.200
- Where's Brass?
- The ambulance just left.

29:56.266 --> 29:58.467
He needed surgery.
- Aw, fuck!

29:58.533 --> 29:59.934
How bad was he?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.600
- On the big scale of things,
he's gonna be just fine.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.133
- But?
- But Dave's done

30:03.200 --> 30:04.533
with basketball.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.934
His Achilles tendon
wasn't just severed.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.066
A chunk of it was missing.

30:08.133 --> 30:10.233
He'll be walking funny
the rest of his life.

30:26.667 --> 30:29.000
- What you want?

30:29.066 --> 30:30.333
- How does it feel?

30:30.400 --> 30:31.834
- How does what feel?

30:31.900 --> 30:35.767
- Being the one who
snitched to the hacks,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.400
who kept us
from greasing

30:37.467 --> 30:39.834
Morales, Pancamo,
and the rest,

30:39.900 --> 30:44.533
who kept us from
taking over the drug trade?

30:44.600 --> 30:45.700
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.400
Come here, come here,
come here.

30:47.467 --> 30:50.734
Listen, Burr Redding
says you get to live

30:50.800 --> 30:53.000
'cause you and he
got history.

30:53.066 --> 30:55.867
But he ain't gonna
be around forever, bro.

30:55.934 --> 30:58.066
And when he die...

30:58.133 --> 30:59.900
you die.

30:59.967 --> 31:01.600
- Let the man go, son.

31:01.667 --> 31:02.867
- Oh, you want something?

31:02.934 --> 31:04.233
- What's up, nigga?

31:04.300 --> 31:05.367
- You know,
much as I'd like to watch

31:05.433 --> 31:06.633
the two of you
whack each other,

31:06.700 --> 31:09.133
the smart thing to do
is walk away.

31:10.633 --> 31:12.900
- Yeah. Later.

31:12.967 --> 31:15.233
- Oh, you know it.

31:18.033 --> 31:20.533
This is all I'm saying,
Augustus.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.533
You ain't got no friends...

31:22.600 --> 31:24.200
Except me.

31:46.533 --> 31:48.266
- The plan's working?

31:48.333 --> 31:50.467
- Yeah.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.233
Morales and Pancamo
think I'm their slave.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.767
- Burr Redding thinks
I'm his most loyal soldier.

31:56.834 --> 32:00.867
- When we're done,
they'll all be dead.

32:00.934 --> 32:03.867
And we'll be
running things our way.

32:03.934 --> 32:05.867
I have to admit, Tug...

32:05.934 --> 32:08.600
I was kind of surprised
when you tapped my shoulder,

32:08.667 --> 32:12.467
me being the one that greased
your brother and all.

32:12.533 --> 32:16.200
- When I shanked you
and you didn't die,

32:16.266 --> 32:19.100
I knew you had balls.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.734
- It doesn't take a genius
to figure out

32:22.800 --> 32:24.533
that Tug Daniels
is a traitor.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.467
- Mm, I always had
my suspicions.

32:27.533 --> 32:29.233
- What are you gonna
do about him?

32:29.300 --> 32:33.300
- Well, I believe that every man
deserves a fair trial...

32:35.200 --> 32:37.300
Before he's executed.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.700
This court
is now in session.

32:51.767 --> 32:53.567
- Fuck you!

32:53.633 --> 32:56.834
- Tug Daniels, you're being
accused of the three disses:

32:56.900 --> 33:00.867
disloyal, dishonest,
disrespectful.

33:00.934 --> 33:02.066
- How do you plead?

33:02.133 --> 33:03.867
- Man, if y'all gonna
take me out,

33:03.934 --> 33:05.533
just fucking
take me out, man.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.967
Stop the bullshit, all right?

33:07.033 --> 33:10.100
- You've been seen fraternizing
with Supreme Allah.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.567
- Man, I only let that fool
think I was with him, man.

33:12.633 --> 33:16.400
Soon as I killed you,
him and Hill was dead meat.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.600
- The prosecution rests.

33:18.667 --> 33:21.500
- You got any defense?
- Yeah, I got a defense.

33:21.567 --> 33:25.734
You're killing me for the same
crime you let Hill walk on.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.700
You're getting old, Burr.

33:27.767 --> 33:29.834
Getting soft.
Can't go the distance no more.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.934
- Silence!
- Yo, with me in charge,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.266
you motherfuckers
would be running Oz.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.900
- Pay attention to what
I'm fixing to tell you.

33:39.467 --> 33:41.800
It is the decision
of this court

33:41.867 --> 33:44.066
that you have
been found guilty.

33:44.133 --> 33:46.066
- Man, kill this old pussy,
not me!

33:46.133 --> 33:49.533
- Therefore,
I hereby sentence you...

34:08.100 --> 34:10.100
- To death.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.467
Throw his ass back there
behind the cafeteria.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.700
Stick him in
the garbage dumpster.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.367
Move it!

34:36.333 --> 34:38.400
- What the fuck?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.533
Oh, shit!

34:43.600 --> 34:45.633
Hey, Officer Robinson, yo.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.033
You might wanna
come check this out.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.233
Ouch!

34:51.433 --> 34:53.133
- Central, this is 16.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.633
We got a 44 in the cafeteria.

34:54.700 --> 34:57.734
Lockdown!
Lockdown!

34:59.700 --> 35:02.567
- Tug Daniels is dead.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.867
- Move it, move it!

35:06.834 --> 35:09.066
- Our days
are numbered, bro.

35:09.133 --> 35:10.800
Me and you ain't careful,

35:10.867 --> 35:12.934
we're gonna end up
like Tug Daniels.

35:15.567 --> 35:18.133
- Let's go. Let's go!

35:25.934 --> 35:28.066
- More and more these days,
you pick up a newspaper

35:28.133 --> 35:30.266
and some athlete's name
is in the headline.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.000
Not on the sports page,

35:32.066 --> 35:34.033
but for getting into trouble
with the law.

35:34.100 --> 35:36.467
I'm never surprised.

35:36.533 --> 35:38.166
The adrenaline it takes
to be a superstar

35:38.233 --> 35:40.934
is the same as the rush
you feel committing a crime.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.700
When the game's over,
it's hard to put a cap on that,

35:43.767 --> 35:46.767
hard to go back
to being ordinary.

35:48.567 --> 35:51.700
- I am so sick of hearing
about fucking death row.

35:51.767 --> 35:54.567
- Governor.
- I see you're fully recovered.

35:54.633 --> 35:58.500
- And I can see
how much that pleases you.

35:58.567 --> 36:01.467
All right, let's get
down to business.

36:01.533 --> 36:03.266
I've had extensive talks
with the attorney general,

36:03.333 --> 36:05.900
and here's how
the situation lays out.

36:05.967 --> 36:09.533
According to the law,
Giles is within his rights

36:09.600 --> 36:11.533
asking to be
stoned to death.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.367
The fucking anti-death
penalty group

36:13.433 --> 36:15.567
that's suing us
will probably win.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.500
We'll appeal.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.633
The case will eventually land
at the State Supreme Court,

36:19.700 --> 36:22.200
where God knows what
those buttheads will decide.

36:22.266 --> 36:23.867
- You appointed half of them.

36:25.633 --> 36:28.133
- Thanks for reminding me.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.500
So, instead of plodding
through all that muck,

36:30.567 --> 36:33.900
we've decided that it's simpler
if you, Sister Peter Marie,

36:33.967 --> 36:36.500
declare Giles
mentally incompetent.

36:36.567 --> 36:37.567
- What?

36:37.633 --> 36:39.300
- I'll commute
his sentence to life

36:39.367 --> 36:41.667
and we'll ship his ass over
to the Connelly Institute,

36:41.734 --> 36:44.333
where he can blubber
till he dies.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.100
Meanwhile, I'll have
the legislature

36:46.166 --> 36:47.667
rewrite the capital
punishment law,

36:47.734 --> 36:49.500
limiting
the prisoners' options

36:49.567 --> 36:51.934
to lethal injection
and electrocution.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.200
- I won't do it.

36:53.266 --> 36:55.934
I won't say that
William Giles is insane.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.767
- Why?
- Because he's not.

36:58.834 --> 37:02.400
- Leo, now would be a good time
for you to jump in.

37:04.333 --> 37:07.500
- Peter Marie, this solution
would make the problem go away.

37:07.567 --> 37:10.100
- The problem will go away

37:10.166 --> 37:13.133
when the death penalty
goes away.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.600
Now that there's DNA,
every other week--

37:15.667 --> 37:17.066
every other week--

37:17.133 --> 37:19.367
there's another horror story
of some innocent man

37:19.433 --> 37:20.734
almost being put to death.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.100
The Governor of Illinois
has put a moratorium on--

37:24.166 --> 37:26.467
- George Ryan is an asshole!

37:26.533 --> 37:28.033
And if I wanna
debate this issue,

37:28.100 --> 37:30.600
I'll go on
"Meet the" fucking "Press"!

37:32.066 --> 37:34.100
You're not the only shrink
in town, Sister.

37:34.166 --> 37:37.200
If you won't say he's crazy,
I'll get someone who will.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.400
- Hello, William.

37:51.467 --> 37:54.834
- Peter--Peter Marie.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.533
- How you doing?
- Moses...

37:59.433 --> 38:02.066
Dead.

38:02.133 --> 38:03.900
Lonely.

38:03.967 --> 38:06.400
- I'll bet.

38:06.467 --> 38:08.500
You know, it's lonely
out here too.

38:10.367 --> 38:11.700
Your life,

38:11.767 --> 38:14.233
the lives of hundreds
of other men and women,

38:14.300 --> 38:16.533
in the hands of
lawyers and politicians.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.467
I feel so...

38:19.533 --> 38:23.033
Powerless.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.667
- Noisemaker.
- Yeah, that's me.

38:26.734 --> 38:28.767
Blowing horns
and banging pots.

38:28.834 --> 38:31.700
And yet,
nothing has changed.

38:41.233 --> 38:44.467
- Us...

38:44.533 --> 38:45.834
pray...

38:48.633 --> 38:50.300
God.

38:50.367 --> 38:53.000
- Well, we do have that,
don't we?

38:53.066 --> 38:56.100
Yes, William.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.333
Us, pray...

39:01.600 --> 39:03.567
God.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.400
- The State Supreme Court,
in a 5-4 decision,

39:12.467 --> 39:14.400
declared the four-year-old
capital punishment law

39:14.467 --> 39:17.100
to be unconstitutional
based on the case

39:17.166 --> 39:19.100
of an inmate at the
Oswald Correctional Facility

39:19.166 --> 39:21.834
who asked to be
stoned to death.

39:21.900 --> 39:23.567
The justices declared
such an execution

39:23.633 --> 39:26.000
would be cruel
and unusual punishment,

39:29.200 --> 39:30.867
- Governor, they said that
you're going back and forth.

39:30.934 --> 39:34.266
- My support for the
death penalty is unwavering.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.233
However, the public's reaction
to this incident

39:36.300 --> 39:40.867
indicates that we should take
this opportunity to step back.

39:40.934 --> 39:43.066
We must consider not only
the means by which

39:43.133 --> 39:45.600
we determine
such a sentence,

39:45.667 --> 39:48.734
but the ways in which
we implement it.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.133
I am, therefore,
putting together

39:50.200 --> 39:52.567
a non-partisan committee

39:52.633 --> 39:56.533
to re-examine all aspects
of the death penalty.

40:10.734 --> 40:12.266
- Hey, Giles, what's going on?

40:12.333 --> 40:13.800
I thought
you were halfway to dead.

40:13.867 --> 40:16.633
- No, alive, alive!

40:27.433 --> 40:29.467
Alive.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.133
- Hey, Officer Murphy,
I don't feel so hot.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.467
- What's the matter now?
- Throat's sore.

40:44.533 --> 40:46.800
- Jeez, you know, you been
getting sick a lot lately.

40:46.867 --> 40:48.800
- Yeah, this winter weather,
it's killing me.

40:48.867 --> 40:52.834
- Uh-huh.
Well, I got news for you.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.767
Dr. Nathan's not in today.

40:54.834 --> 40:58.066
- No?
- How do you feel now?

40:58.133 --> 41:00.033
- I want to go see my brother
in protective custody.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.567
- What a shock.

41:03.934 --> 41:07.767
- In my opinion, calling someone
a deadbeat dad is unfair.

41:07.834 --> 41:09.700
I mean, I would have sent
the money to my kids,

41:09.767 --> 41:13.400
but I knew that bitch would
spend my hard-earned cash

41:13.467 --> 41:16.367
buying clothes for herself
or that cocky kike asshole

41:16.433 --> 41:18.266
she's been living with.

41:18.333 --> 41:21.300
- Ryan!

41:21.367 --> 41:22.934
- Hey, Cyril.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.367
How you doing, brother?

41:25.433 --> 41:26.500
Okay?

41:26.567 --> 41:28.333
- When--when
can I leave here?

41:28.400 --> 41:30.734
When can I come back
to Emerald City?

41:30.800 --> 41:32.734
- I don't know.
You know, Dr. Nathan promised

41:32.800 --> 41:34.300
that she'd help us out,
but she's gone.

41:34.367 --> 41:35.533
So as soon as
she gets back,

41:35.600 --> 41:37.033
we're gonna work on
getting you out of here.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.400
God, this place sucks, man.
I know you're lonely.

41:39.467 --> 41:41.633
- Not so lonely.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.033
Now that Henry's here.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.200
- Hiya.

41:44.266 --> 41:47.033
My name's Stanton,
Henry Stanton.

41:47.100 --> 41:48.734
You're Ryan, right?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.934
Cyril's told me
all about you.

41:53.767 --> 41:56.433
What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing incriminating.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.000
- Well, that's good,
you know,

41:58.066 --> 41:59.166
'cause I figure a guy's
in protective custody,

41:59.233 --> 42:00.500
then, well,
he must have, what?

42:00.567 --> 42:01.900
Ratted out his friends?

42:01.967 --> 42:03.367
- No. No.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.667
Some Aryan threatened to
separate me from my genitals.

42:05.734 --> 42:06.867
So the Warden
thought a time-out

42:06.934 --> 42:10.567
might ease the tensions.

42:10.633 --> 42:13.767
- Don't be telling
nobody our business, okay?

42:13.834 --> 42:16.266
- I don't. Henry's nice.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.300
- I like your brother--
- Hey!

42:18.367 --> 42:21.066
Henry, do you mind?

42:21.133 --> 42:23.233
I'm trying to have a
private conversation over here.

42:23.300 --> 42:26.333
- Hey, knock yourself out!

42:39.567 --> 42:41.400
- Oh, Jesus.

42:41.467 --> 42:42.834
What do you want?

42:42.900 --> 42:44.266
- Just because
we're not fucking anymore

42:44.333 --> 42:45.834
doesn't mean
we can't still be friends.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.734
- Yeah, right.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.467
- I hear they're shipping your
brother off to the looney bin.

42:49.533 --> 42:50.900
- Yeah, because
of you accusing him

42:50.967 --> 42:53.133
of attacking you
without provocation.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.900
- I was being neighborly,
he hit me with a tray.

42:54.967 --> 42:56.633
- Neighborly?

42:56.700 --> 42:57.800
Yeah, right.

42:57.867 --> 42:59.633
- Here's the deal:

42:59.700 --> 43:03.567
I'll tell the Warden
not to send Cyril away

43:03.633 --> 43:08.166
if you tell Cyril
he should let me fuck him.

43:08.233 --> 43:09.934
- What?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.600
- I wanna fuck your brother.
- Uh-uh, no chance.

43:12.667 --> 43:14.867
I don't want you going
anywhere near my brother.

43:14.934 --> 43:16.333
- Okay.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.100
But if I don't
get anywhere near him,

43:18.166 --> 43:19.867
you won't get
anywhere near him either.

43:19.934 --> 43:22.734
- You know what, Howell?

43:25.100 --> 43:27.834
You're one sick,
fucking bitch.

43:32.633 --> 43:35.667
- Deputy Dawg.

43:35.734 --> 43:37.867
- O'Reily.

43:37.934 --> 43:39.500
It's about time.
I'm famished.

43:39.567 --> 43:41.934
- Things are pretty quiet
in Unit J these days, huh, man?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.934
- Well, Basil dead,
Hughes in Solitary,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.567
just me
and Her Highness.

43:47.633 --> 43:48.800
- You don't like Howell?

43:48.867 --> 43:50.100
- It's like being shackled

43:50.166 --> 43:53.233
to the Bride of Frankenstein.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.767
- Hey, Alvin, old pal.

43:56.834 --> 43:58.433
How'd you like
some extra vittles?

43:58.500 --> 44:00.433
I'm talking
chocolate bars,

44:00.500 --> 44:02.934
Newman's Own popcorn
for that microwave of yours?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.600
- Sure.
- All you have to do is

44:04.667 --> 44:06.467
just, you know,
make sure that Howell

44:06.533 --> 44:08.333
has a little accident.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.300
- Oh, I'm no killer.

44:10.367 --> 44:12.834
- No, no,
I'm not saying kill.

44:12.900 --> 44:16.633
I'm talking
a busted leg, arm,

44:16.700 --> 44:17.867
just something to
take her out of commission

44:17.934 --> 44:21.033
for a week or two.

44:21.100 --> 44:24.800
- You about done, O'Reily?

44:24.867 --> 44:28.400
- Oh, yeah, I'm done.

44:46.333 --> 44:48.533
- Ah!

44:53.266 --> 44:55.800
Maybe I got lucky
and she's dead.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.033
Help. Help.

45:05.166 --> 45:09.667
Help! Help!

45:09.734 --> 45:10.900
Help!

45:13.100 --> 45:15.300
- What's up?
- Howell broke her pelvis.

45:15.367 --> 45:16.934
- Oh, sweet.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.066
- Yeah, she'll be
laid up for a while.

45:18.133 --> 45:20.300
- Oh, I'm just crying
invisible tears.

45:25.767 --> 45:26.967
How's your new cellmate?

45:27.033 --> 45:28.700
- Oh, Connolly's an ass.

45:28.767 --> 45:30.066
Says I'm not true Irish.

45:30.133 --> 45:33.166
- He tried to pull that
same line of shit with me.

45:33.233 --> 45:34.667
Don't worry,
he'll come around.

45:34.734 --> 45:37.467
- Yeah.
- Hey, Liam,

45:37.533 --> 45:38.900
check out a guy
named Henry Stanton.

45:38.967 --> 45:40.533
He's down in protective
custody with Cyril.

45:40.600 --> 45:41.834
- No problem.

45:52.734 --> 45:54.166
- Stay down.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.900
Stay down!
- Hey!

45:58.967 --> 46:00.200
What the fuck
is going on here?

46:00.266 --> 46:01.867
- Keep away, O'Reily.
It's none of your concern.

46:01.934 --> 46:04.934
- I see two pussy Bible belters
wailing on a fellow Catholic?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.467
Yeah, it's my concern.

46:06.533 --> 46:07.967
- Hey, come on,
motherfucker.

46:08.033 --> 46:11.633
- I'm not gonna swing on you,
Burns, not yet.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.100
I got God on my side.

46:15.734 --> 46:19.400
- Kirk, you meet me
in the library.

46:19.467 --> 46:22.333
Burns, I will
talk to you later.

46:24.867 --> 46:27.967
My apologies, sir.

46:38.633 --> 46:40.000
- I'm beholden to you.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.433
- First you had
Samuel Gougeon beaten,

46:48.500 --> 46:50.633
now Padraig Connolly,
both against my wishes.

46:50.700 --> 46:53.900
- I am doing the Lord's work
in the best way I know how.

46:53.967 --> 46:56.467
- When you came to me
and you asked to convert,

46:56.533 --> 46:59.000
I thought you meant you wanted
to put those ways behind you.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.133
But I can see now
that I was wrong.

47:02.200 --> 47:05.767
You are no longer a member
of my congregation.

47:05.834 --> 47:09.000
- What?
- I cast thee out.

47:09.066 --> 47:11.200
- You can't.
- Let me go.

47:11.266 --> 47:14.200
- Please.
- Let me go!

47:24.767 --> 47:28.100
- 1972, 14 Catholics
were slaughtered.

47:28.166 --> 47:29.900
- What did they do?

47:29.967 --> 47:32.767
- They committed the hideous
crime of walking down a road.

47:32.834 --> 47:35.633
My mother ran out
onto the street

47:35.700 --> 47:39.166
and grabbed the neighbor's son
out of the stampede.

47:39.233 --> 47:41.500
The entire time,
a British soldier

47:41.567 --> 47:43.600
was holding an L1A1
to her head,

47:43.667 --> 47:45.800
yelling at her
to get back.

47:45.867 --> 47:48.000
But she didn't.

47:49.934 --> 47:51.600
And he fired.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.033
- Oh, shit.

47:53.100 --> 47:55.233
- We call that day
Bloody Sunday.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.533
- Well, it's visiting time.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.400
I gotta go.
- Who's coming?

47:59.467 --> 48:00.867
- My mom.

48:00.934 --> 48:02.633
- You treat
your mother right, Ryan?

48:02.700 --> 48:04.967
- We've been separated
since I was a baby.

48:05.033 --> 48:06.734
We only just
found each other.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.567
But, yeah,

48:08.633 --> 48:11.066
I treat her right.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.767
- I know you wonder
why I left,

48:14.834 --> 48:16.266
and each time
I've come to visit you,

48:16.333 --> 48:19.133
I've wanted to tell you
the whole story, but...

48:19.200 --> 48:21.867
- I mean, tell me now.

48:21.934 --> 48:25.066
- The '60s
were a mixed-up time.

48:25.133 --> 48:28.533
We were living in a cold water
flat near the university.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.900
And while I did what
wives did in those days,

48:32.967 --> 48:36.433
outside, the streets
were on fire with protests.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.934
- The Vietnam War.
- Yeah.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.700
I would carry you
out into the crowd

48:39.767 --> 48:41.533
and listen
to the speeches.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.734
And then one day,
something just clicked

48:43.800 --> 48:45.266
and I had to join.

48:45.333 --> 48:47.700
So I had to leave.

48:47.767 --> 48:50.900
- Yeah, but why didn't you
take me with you?

48:50.967 --> 48:54.533
- Well, because my friends
fought for peace.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.667
We armed ourselves.

48:56.734 --> 48:58.500
We were militant.

48:58.567 --> 49:00.400
- And someone got killed.

49:00.467 --> 49:04.967
- Yeah, and I ran,
and I kept running.

49:05.033 --> 49:06.834
- Jesus.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.500
- And so,
now after 35 years,

49:09.567 --> 49:12.266
I've decided to stop
the marathon.

49:14.233 --> 49:17.300
I'm gonna turn myself in.

49:17.367 --> 49:18.767
- But what'll hap--

49:18.834 --> 49:20.400
- I don't know
what'll happen to me,

49:20.467 --> 49:23.900
and I don't know
if I'll go to prison.

49:23.967 --> 49:25.266
But I wanted
to see you again

49:25.333 --> 49:27.100
and spend a few hours
with you

49:27.166 --> 49:28.667
and get to know you
a little before

49:28.734 --> 49:30.367
whatever happens
does happen.

49:30.433 --> 49:32.133
- No, no!

49:32.200 --> 49:35.300
No, I--no.
I can't lose you now.

49:35.367 --> 49:37.500
Not after all these years.

49:37.567 --> 49:38.900
Fuck that!

49:38.967 --> 49:40.400
Don't give yourself up.

49:40.467 --> 49:42.400
- I have to, Ryan.

49:42.467 --> 49:45.200
I'm no good to you unless
I'm true to who I am.

49:50.300 --> 49:51.800
- Fuck.

49:51.867 --> 49:53.400
Look...

49:56.000 --> 49:58.333
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

49:58.400 --> 50:00.166
at least not yet.

50:02.100 --> 50:05.700
What if I told you I can fix it
so we can be together?

50:05.767 --> 50:07.767
- What do you mean?

50:07.834 --> 50:10.467
- A friend of mine is gonna
help me and Cyril escape.

50:10.533 --> 50:13.000
- No, Ryan, don't do that.

50:13.066 --> 50:14.967
- Why the fuck not?
- Because...

50:15.033 --> 50:16.266
you'll have to spend
the rest of your life

50:16.333 --> 50:17.667
doing what I've done.

50:17.734 --> 50:19.066
Hiding and lying

50:19.133 --> 50:21.567
and living in fear
and denying who you are.

50:21.633 --> 50:23.667
And that's a life
without meaning.

50:23.734 --> 50:26.734
And a life without meaning
is no life at all.

50:28.667 --> 50:30.133
- Visit's over, O'Reily.

50:37.734 --> 50:40.100
- Mom.

50:40.166 --> 50:43.333
- You called me Mom.

50:46.266 --> 50:48.867
I love you, Ryan.

50:48.934 --> 50:51.700
I always have and...

50:51.767 --> 50:53.467
I always will.

50:57.734 --> 51:00.333
both: Bye.

51:20.967 --> 51:22.400
- Bad news.

51:22.467 --> 51:24.200
The Attorney General
has circumvented

51:24.266 --> 51:25.433
the law of asylum.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.333
- You saying
we've lost the fight?

51:29.500 --> 51:32.300
- Your deportation
has been ordered.

51:32.367 --> 51:34.967
A week from today, you'll be
standing before a British judge.

51:38.467 --> 51:40.667
- Once I get there,
I'll not get a fair trial.

51:40.734 --> 51:41.734
I'll hang.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.734
- I know.

51:54.033 --> 51:55.633
- You admit
to murdering him

51:55.700 --> 51:57.967
even though you know
I could tell the Warden

51:58.033 --> 51:59.133
that you confessed,
and you'd probably

51:59.200 --> 52:00.400
end up on death row?

52:00.467 --> 52:02.000
- Yes.

52:07.367 --> 52:09.433
both: Hey.

52:09.500 --> 52:12.300
- How's Cyril?
- Oh, he's a little anxious

52:12.367 --> 52:13.800
to get out
of protective custody,

52:13.867 --> 52:14.867
but he's okay.

52:14.934 --> 52:16.900
Hey, did you...

52:17.000 --> 52:18.233
did you give
any more thought to--

52:18.300 --> 52:19.967
to what we talked about?

52:20.033 --> 52:21.867
- Any thought?
Your little proposition

52:21.934 --> 52:23.166
had me sleepless
for three nights.

52:23.233 --> 52:25.266
- And what
have you decided?

52:29.333 --> 52:30.800
- Here.

52:30.867 --> 52:32.834
- Why are you
giving me this?

52:32.900 --> 52:34.600
- Ten minutes ago,
the Warden asked me

52:34.667 --> 52:36.667
if I knew anything
about Keenan's death.

52:36.734 --> 52:39.600
- What?
- I lied and said no.

52:39.667 --> 52:42.100
- Oh, man, thank Christ.

52:42.166 --> 52:45.100
- Ryan, as we speak,
the medical board

52:45.166 --> 52:48.967
is deliberating whether or not
I'm qualified to hold this job.

52:49.033 --> 52:52.633
They're questioning
my ethics, okay?

52:52.700 --> 52:55.000
My initial reaction was,
how can they do that?

52:55.066 --> 52:58.467
But you know what?

53:00.033 --> 53:02.300
Now I'm questioning
my ethics.

53:02.367 --> 53:06.633
- Look, love is more
important than ethics.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.633
- Well, now, how would
you know that?

53:09.700 --> 53:11.600
I mean, your ethics--
what few you have--

53:11.667 --> 53:13.266
are completely screwed up.

53:13.333 --> 53:15.633
- Whoa, why the fuck
are you doing this?

53:15.700 --> 53:17.433
- I should tell Leo

53:17.500 --> 53:21.266
that you beat
Keenan to death.

53:21.333 --> 53:24.300
I should do it...

53:24.367 --> 53:26.300
But I won't.
God help me.

53:26.367 --> 53:28.066
- Hey, Gloria--

53:28.133 --> 53:32.033
- I am not gonna
help you escape.

53:32.100 --> 53:34.867
Do you understand that?

53:34.934 --> 53:36.700
I will not do it.

53:36.767 --> 53:38.266
And if you
ask me again,

53:38.333 --> 53:40.700
I will tell the Warden
everything.

53:42.166 --> 53:44.000
Officer,
we're done here.

53:48.767 --> 53:50.700
- I do have ethics...

53:50.767 --> 53:52.967
and they're not screwed up.

54:10.533 --> 54:12.734
- What do you want?

54:12.800 --> 54:16.300
- I've been on the computer
reading about the troubles.

54:16.367 --> 54:18.100
It's not at all about God.

54:18.166 --> 54:20.200
It's about the money.

54:20.266 --> 54:23.367
It's about the Protestants
taking Catholic land.

54:23.433 --> 54:25.633
How could you
not hate the British?

54:25.700 --> 54:27.500
I mean, if you got
any balls at all,

54:27.567 --> 54:29.633
then you'd better be IRA.

54:29.700 --> 54:31.700
You know, fighting
for what's rightfully yours.

54:31.767 --> 54:33.533
- And what good does
your newfound knowledge

54:33.600 --> 54:37.266
and all this enthusiasm
do for either of us?

54:37.333 --> 54:41.300
- I wanna be part of something,
something that matters.

54:42.333 --> 54:43.800
Don't laugh at me, Connolly.

54:43.867 --> 54:46.433
Hey, everyone knows
I get things done.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.934
That's my talent.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Let me help you do
something for the cause.

54:51.066 --> 54:54.100
Hmm?
Something for Ireland?

55:03.500 --> 55:05.800
- All righty.

55:08.300 --> 55:11.533
I know what we should do.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.266
- Hey.

55:26.834 --> 55:29.900
Two gallons of bleach.
- Good.

55:29.967 --> 55:31.367
All your whites
are clean.

55:31.433 --> 55:32.867
So you gonna tell me now

55:32.934 --> 55:34.367
why you needed this stuff
so bad?

55:34.433 --> 55:36.133
- Can you get me
a wristwatch?

55:36.200 --> 55:38.867
- A wristwatch?

55:38.934 --> 55:40.700
Why?

55:43.233 --> 55:46.066
Connolly, what the fuck
are you doing?

55:46.133 --> 55:47.934
- Would you be willing
to die with me?

55:50.033 --> 55:51.934
Would you?

56:08.367 --> 56:12.367
The bleach and the wristwatch
are part of my grand scheme.

56:12.433 --> 56:14.767
- Which is what?

56:14.834 --> 56:17.767
- To make a bomb.

56:17.834 --> 56:19.567
You and me, O'Reily,

56:19.633 --> 56:21.567
we're gonna
blow up Emerald City.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.100
- What?

56:34.266 --> 56:36.734
- In any sport,
to experience victory,

56:36.800 --> 56:40.367
the one element you need more
than any other is teamwork.

56:40.433 --> 56:42.567
But teamwork is also
the scariest notion

56:42.633 --> 56:44.266
a person can face.

56:44.333 --> 56:47.667
Joining a team means giving up
part of your individuality,

56:47.734 --> 56:49.900
being willing to make whatever
sacrifice is necessary

56:49.967 --> 56:51.734
for the greater cause.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.000
If you're willing to do
these things,

56:53.066 --> 56:55.533
to truly become
a team player,

56:55.600 --> 56:57.500
then success will follow.

56:57.567 --> 56:59.967
But a word of caution:

57:00.033 --> 57:02.633
be sure that the success
you go after...

57:04.834 --> 57:06.934
Is the success you need.
