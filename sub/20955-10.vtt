WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:04.405
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.438 --> 00:05.406
CAMILA: Sinaloa has a right
to know who you are.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.541
EPI: What?

00:07.575 --> 00:08.976
CAMILA: Isabela has a right to
know about your hypocrisy.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.144
-Where's Cole?
-Do I know you?

00:10.178 --> 00:11.845
You know exactly who I am.

00:11.879 --> 00:12.913
Teo did a good job of
hiding your ownership

00:12.946 --> 00:14.382
in shell corporations.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.217
I'll give you 3 million
for 100 keys.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.851
If all goes well
with my customers,

00:17.885 --> 00:20.020
I'll take the rest of it
and deliver 27 million.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.555
How would you like
to own my business?

00:21.589 --> 00:23.091
I will sell it to you.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.227
POTE: (speaking Spanish)

00:26.260 --> 00:28.662
ALONZO: Teresa Mendoza.
This is Agent Loya.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.231
Our offer's still on the table

00:30.264 --> 00:31.899
if you choose to
cooperate against Camila.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.267
TERESA: Are you okay?
-Only if you have a gun.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.535
(gunshots, man yelps)

00:34.568 --> 00:35.869
(gun fires)

00:35.903 --> 00:37.371
Look what we have here.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.407
Camila Vargas,
you're under arrest.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.541
(dramatic music)

00:41.942 --> 00:45.045
(somber music)

00:45.079 --> 00:48.582
*

00:48.616 --> 00:50.284
Next in line.

00:50.318 --> 00:57.325
*

00:58.426 --> 01:01.429
(woman speaks indistinctly
over PA)

01:09.737 --> 01:12.706
What do you
need me to do?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.942
You're gonna cover for me.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.945
Keep things status quo
while I'm here.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.548
Work alongside James.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.916
Whatever you need, I'm ready.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.320
CAMILA: Yes.
You are, Teresa.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.889
You're here because of me.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.125
I called the DEA agent.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.294
You saved my life.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.764
Again.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.167
(indistinct chatter)

01:39.200 --> 01:41.602
(ominous music)

01:41.635 --> 01:48.642
*

01:52.280 --> 01:53.681
I just made a deal.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.616
You'll get
extra protection in here.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.021
You think we can trust them?

02:01.054 --> 02:03.591
I mean, if we bought them,
someone else can too.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.294
Our guy in the
Sheriff's Department trusts him

02:06.327 --> 02:08.429
You'll be safe.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.264
Cole said it's a bad search.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.765
You'll be out in a couple days.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.935
Until then, you and Teresa

02:14.968 --> 02:17.505
will be working together,
holding up things.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.273
The priority is
to assure our associates

02:19.307 --> 02:20.708
that everything's well.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.710
Excuse me.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.345
TERESA: I'll be right back.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.350
The minute I'm gone,
you end up in here?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.051
She's not ready, Camila.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.954
I can handle the business alone.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.190
If it wasn't for Teresa,

02:36.224 --> 02:38.992
we wouldn't have
anything worth protecting.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.268
Hi. Excuse me.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.671
Where you from?

02:52.440 --> 02:55.243
You got a lot of balls,
coming at a stranger like that.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.978
That woman I was talking to,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.748
she comes from a very important
family in Sinaloa.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.753
Lil Traviesa.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.421
Lil T.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.189
Teresa Mendoza.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.225
I have
business to discuss.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.529
So let us get to it.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.932
I'm selling all my business
to you, Boaz.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.335
You'll have complete ownership.

03:21.369 --> 03:24.772
Colonel Cortez will remain
as your operational partner.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.540
Reynaldo will keep the pipeline

03:26.574 --> 03:28.442
with the product
coming from Colombia.

03:28.476 --> 03:31.679
And I will retain no supervisory
nor veto power,

03:31.712 --> 03:33.281
as long as it doesn't

03:33.314 --> 03:35.148
interfere with my duties
as governor.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.521
What if your duties include
stopping my business?

03:40.554 --> 03:43.691
Our people rely on
the cocaine production

03:43.724 --> 03:45.025
for their survival.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.394
I'm a pragmatist.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.629
I have no desire to end that.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.364
As long as
you conduct yourself

03:50.398 --> 03:51.865
as a proper businessman,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.568
we have no issues.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.637
REYNALDO:
I'm sure Boaz understands

03:56.670 --> 03:58.706
how profitable stability is

03:58.739 --> 04:00.774
and will make a fine partner.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.913
Being a cabrón is a choice.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.482
But with all this money,

04:08.516 --> 04:10.050
I'm sure I can be a nice guy.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.885
(soft chuckling)

04:11.919 --> 04:14.322
CORTEZ: I'm wondering, Governor,

04:14.355 --> 04:18.392
when a great warrior
decides to retire,

04:18.426 --> 04:21.429
how long before he misses
the thrill of the battle?

04:21.462 --> 04:25.333
If he doesn't have
the fight in him any longer,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.000
never.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.837
My family will be
my priority, but...

04:29.870 --> 04:31.739
I have one condition.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.343
Camila is in jail, and
her business will be crippled.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.811
You did an excellent job,
Colonel.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.413
(brooding dramatic music)

04:39.447 --> 04:42.282
You may continue
going after her business,

04:42.316 --> 04:44.184
but not her life.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.753
Ever.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.022
*

04:49.056 --> 04:51.959
Congratulations, gentlemen.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
We will celebrate this--

04:53.561 --> 04:55.696
and our new union
with a charreria

04:55.729 --> 04:57.331
at my brother's ranch.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.099
A gentlemen's affair.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.968
I look forward to it.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.270
*

05:03.303 --> 05:06.306
(crickets chirping)

05:11.479 --> 05:13.647
(distant horns honking)

05:16.750 --> 05:19.119
Let me take the lead
with George.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.622
Anything about Camila,
it's just a blip on the radar.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.791
Maybe I can help.
He trusts me.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.225
He knows I'm her right hand.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.794
We get this and we go.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.662
(country rock music
over speakers)

05:28.696 --> 05:30.297
GEORGE: Whoa-boy!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.399
(laughs)
Whoo!

05:31.432 --> 05:33.200
Whoo-boy!

05:33.233 --> 05:34.568
There she is!

05:34.602 --> 05:35.636
(laughs)

05:35.669 --> 05:37.337
Come on, Bilal.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.406
I got company.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.307
*

05:40.340 --> 05:41.642
T-Rex!

05:41.675 --> 05:42.843
Oh!

05:42.876 --> 05:45.045
Bilal, go check on the shipment!

05:45.078 --> 05:46.647
I miss you, girl.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.881
(friendly growl)

05:47.915 --> 05:50.050
(chuckles)

05:50.083 --> 05:51.318
TERESA: Hi, George.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.653
Oh, it's nice of y'all to visit.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.087
I thought Camila might have been

05:54.121 --> 05:55.689
keeping you in
the cage with her.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.091
About that,
she'll be out in 48 hours.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.660
It's a bullshit charge.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.228
Business is status quo.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.564
Oh, status quo, huh?

06:03.597 --> 06:05.399
What say you, princepesa?

06:05.433 --> 06:07.067
I got your assurances on that?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.569
Yeah.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.438
Well, hell,

06:10.471 --> 06:12.606
if Leia says let it ride,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.375
then I'ma put all my chips
on the fuckin' table.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.410
(chuckles)

06:16.444 --> 06:18.779
Who's the Wookie?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.347
No offense meant, brother.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.949
Chewbacca's the single
greatest wingman

06:21.982 --> 06:24.852
in the history of the universe.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.954
Oh, come on!
Let's do some business.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.388
BILAL: (speaks Somali)

06:28.422 --> 06:30.891
(speaking Somali)

06:30.924 --> 06:32.025
What's wrong?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.794
(speaks Somali)

06:33.827 --> 06:36.129
-We got a problem.
-(shouting Somali)

06:36.163 --> 06:37.230
(gun cocks)

06:37.264 --> 06:40.233
(tense music)

06:40.267 --> 06:44.071
*

06:44.104 --> 06:46.807
No! No! No!

06:46.840 --> 06:49.477
GEORGE: God damn it!

06:49.510 --> 06:53.547
*

06:53.581 --> 06:55.449
The hell!

06:55.483 --> 06:58.151
No! No! No! No!

06:58.185 --> 07:00.821
*

07:00.854 --> 07:02.723
They killed my men
and took the shipment!

07:02.756 --> 07:09.697
*

07:17.370 --> 07:19.607
Bilal!

07:19.640 --> 07:22.576
BILAL: I looked all around.
The cargo's gone.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.678
Our entire shipment
from El Santo.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.179
El Puño

07:26.213 --> 07:28.415
was
Boaz Jimenez's main enforcer.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.251
I took care of him when
you guys were down in La Paz.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.320
This...

07:33.353 --> 07:34.655
is payback.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.691
(soft brooding music)

07:37.725 --> 07:39.026
JAMES: We'll take care of it.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.694
We'll get you more protection--

07:40.728 --> 07:42.696
I don't give a rat's ass
about your cocaine!

07:42.730 --> 07:44.297
That's my boys down there!

07:44.331 --> 07:46.333
We have commitments,
payments to El Santo.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.035
Motherfucker.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.470
Hey.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.872
You don't want to threaten me.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.174
I want to burn you
down right here!

07:54.207 --> 07:56.544
George.
Look at me.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.947
This is not about business.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.550
These were your friends.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.153
*

08:06.186 --> 08:08.188
Whoever did this
is going to pay for it.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.623
We're gonna handle it.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.491
GEORGE: You bet you are.

08:11.525 --> 08:18.165
*

08:18.198 --> 08:20.701
Why the DEA would blow their wad

08:20.734 --> 08:22.970
on this mosquito-bite charge
is beyond me.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.304
It's textbook bad search.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.006
They planted the gun

08:26.039 --> 08:27.741
and a whole whopping
eighth of an ounce of coke,

08:27.775 --> 08:30.844
neither of which
they can prove is yours.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.713
It's laughable.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.414
It's still a felony.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.250
But you're
a first-time offender.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.052
You have 48 hours
till your bail hearing,

08:39.086 --> 08:40.754
and then you go free.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.590
The prosecutor

08:42.623 --> 08:45.593
will drop the indictment,
and the DEA knows this.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.095
This will crumble, Camila.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.600
Have you spoken
to your wife yet?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.501
Not yet.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.570
We have nothing
to worry about with her.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.038
(soft laugh)

08:59.807 --> 09:01.408
She confronted me.

09:01.441 --> 09:05.012
She knew where we were meeting,
and when.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.581
Somebody fed her
that information.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.354
Uh, Kelly Anne knows

09:14.387 --> 09:16.223
what crossing me will get her.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.626
I've got you covered.

09:21.294 --> 09:28.301
*

09:32.472 --> 09:33.907
Well, I didn't say
your protection

09:33.941 --> 09:35.508
would come without a cost.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.115
I'm gonna need to
think about this.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.685
Keep looking for alternatives.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.223
If the DEA does come up with
something on your business

09:50.257 --> 09:51.659
in the next 48 hours,

09:51.692 --> 09:55.595
this... is your only option.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.900
I'm not a stupid woman.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.969
I'm a Longhorn
with a law degree.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.271
And I live a lifestyle that
most people would kill to have.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.007
And you don't get those things
by being a stupid woman.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.342
Kelly Anne,
what did you do?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.745
(distant chatter)

10:11.779 --> 10:13.180
Um.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.584
I confronted Camila Vargas.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.286
After you showed me
that picture

10:19.319 --> 10:20.688
of her and my husband.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.690
And I--I followed him,
and I waited.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.457
And obvious--she--
she denied everything.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.159
But then I went home
and I saw on the news

10:26.193 --> 10:27.695
they're just
slaughtering people.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.362
They're just slaughtering
people like sheep.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.031
And I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to do!

10:31.064 --> 10:32.432
-It's okay. Okay!
-What am I supposed to do--

10:32.465 --> 10:34.167
Okay.
It's okay.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.469
Take a seat.
It's okay.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.539
You made a mistake.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.041
(soft brooding music)

10:41.074 --> 10:42.542
Now, I can protect you,

10:42.575 --> 10:45.612
but I'm gonna need
your help to do it.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.281
Okay.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.818
We're looking for a smoking gun.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.788
Paperwork connecting
Camila to Colibri Trawlers.

10:54.822 --> 10:58.125
Your husband's firm
handled the deal.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.327
Everything about the company's
ownership records

11:00.360 --> 11:02.162
are buried offshore.

11:02.195 --> 11:06.900
But Cole might still have
those papers in his possession.

11:06.934 --> 11:10.470
So you want me
to search my house,

11:10.503 --> 11:13.073
because then you
won't need a warrant.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.744
If you find those papers,
we keep Camila behind bars.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.413
Then we'll talk about how we
keep you safe in the long run.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.250
Okay?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.853
(soft dramatic music)

11:25.886 --> 11:29.422
Boaz hit us 'cause
he thinks Camila's weak.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.091
I'm gonna arrange
a sit-down with him.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.693
We broke him out
of DEA custody last year, so

11:33.727 --> 11:35.528
that should earn us
enough good will.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.064
Strike a truce.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.867
I mean, we need a deal,
not more bloodshed.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.769
Pote took out his enforcer.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.271
This is not about money.
It's personal.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.006
It's always about money.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.440
Till it isn't.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.346
I think we should
speak to Camila before--

11:53.380 --> 11:55.348
There's no way.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.184
So here's what's happening.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.685
I'm gonna meet with him.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.054
You're gonna sit tight.
And that's it.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.727
(car chiming)

12:16.904 --> 12:18.906
POTE: You don't need guns
to sit tight.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.109
I told Camila I wanted
to be her partner.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.544
She asked me to handle
business while she was gone.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.279
Are you with me?

12:26.313 --> 12:27.647
Always the hard way.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.617
(speaking Spanish)

12:30.650 --> 12:32.585
Claro que sí.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.495
I'm sorry to
interrupt your business.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.765
It's not business.
This is pleasure.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.901
I'm designing a home.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.003
Architecture intrigues me.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.339
I don't know much about it.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.008
Oh, but you do.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.010
The building
is just like a business.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.612
If the foundation is weak,

12:59.646 --> 13:01.949
the structure
will never be stable,

13:01.982 --> 13:06.119
and eventually, everything
will come tumbling down.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.587
(soft brooding music)

13:07.620 --> 13:09.622
Camila's charges are weak.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.324
She'll be out
in a couple of days.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.426
This won't affect our business.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.528
Except for the disruption
of her distribution routes

13:15.562 --> 13:16.997
through Corpus Christi.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.598
Give me one good reason

13:18.631 --> 13:20.467
I shouldn't back out
of this right now.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.503
This is a temporary situation.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.637
It's being handled.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.340
-By you?
-Yes.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.110
The attack on our ships
wasn't a setback.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.945
It's an opportunity
for both of us

13:31.979 --> 13:32.946
to expand our business.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.814
How so?

13:34.848 --> 13:38.285
Guarantee me you won't
stop distributing our product

13:38.318 --> 13:39.552
and I'll tell you.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.954
You asking me to close the deal

13:40.988 --> 13:42.622
before you even pitched.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.125
That's a rather bold move,
Miss Mendoza.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.860
It's not bold.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.528
It's smart business,

13:48.561 --> 13:50.197
for both of us.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.501
My brother...

13:54.534 --> 13:56.069
(horse nickers)

13:56.103 --> 13:59.139
My brother used to
love the horses.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.074
Me?
Not so much.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.044
(spits)
This place smells like shit.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.180
(speaking Spanish)

14:10.183 --> 14:11.751
Given the situation at hand,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.687
I thought it best
not to add fuel to the fire.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.990
You struck while
Camila was in prison,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.992
because you think
she's vulnerable.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.660
Let me assure you,
she's not.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.662
And yet the blood
of a dozen dead mayates

14:22.695 --> 14:23.931
taints the waters,

14:23.964 --> 14:25.565
while I benefit from the fruits

14:25.598 --> 14:29.102
of a deal you made
with the madman, huh?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.504
An attack on our transportation

14:31.538 --> 14:33.773
is a direct attack on us.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.742
And that warrants retaliation.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.577
(clicks tongue)

14:37.610 --> 14:39.379
But you're not here for that.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
I'm here to save bloodshed
on both sides.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.216
(horse neighs)

14:43.250 --> 14:45.953
And to make a deal
which we can both benefit from.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.856
(speaking Spanish)

14:49.889 --> 14:53.093
The moment that your buyers
try our product,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.894
they won't go back to yours.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.563
We got the connect
with El Santo.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.032
And one stolen shipment's
not changing that.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.802
(soft dramatic music)

15:02.835 --> 15:04.537
So what are you proposing?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.707
We'll not expand into
your territory in West Texas.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.577
And you and Epifanio will
cease any and all moves

15:10.610 --> 15:12.412
against our business
immediately.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.382
That's your offer?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.217
I get to keep
what I already have?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.987
If this lasts for 60 days,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.255
no moves on either side,

15:22.289 --> 15:23.790
we can negotiate a wholesale

15:23.823 --> 15:25.592
for some of
the Bolivian product.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.896
*

15:29.929 --> 15:33.466
That's if you can move Epifanio.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.903
(speaking Spanish)

15:36.936 --> 15:42.675
*

15:42.709 --> 15:44.344
Estamos.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.486
Phoenix. Mesa. Scottsdale.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.954
You don't fly there.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.956
Too many
independent contractors.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.758
I don't do well with chaos.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.161
Because it's run
by Boaz Jimenez.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.596
It's 30% of his business

16:03.630 --> 16:05.932
that no one has challenged.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.434
I have connections
on the streets

16:07.467 --> 16:09.269
that would take care of sales,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.438
and muscle to back it up.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.773
You got a street gang?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.376
You've lined up infrastructure
and some heat to protect it.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.545
And with Las Sombras,
we will have soldiers

16:18.578 --> 16:20.613
in every single city
in the Southwest.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.117
We'll take his territory without
firing even a single bullet.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.685
Is this Camila's plan?

16:25.718 --> 16:28.455
Mine.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.023
Hm.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.193
(soft music)

16:33.226 --> 16:36.729
*

16:36.763 --> 16:38.798
Camila underestimates you,
Teresa.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.233
We have a deal?

16:40.267 --> 16:41.668
I'll have my people
do some research

16:41.701 --> 16:44.904
and take a look at the numbers.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.674
Tell Camila the money
will be delivered on schedule.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.877
And our arrangement
will continue as planned.

16:50.910 --> 16:55.815
*

16:55.848 --> 16:57.384
(glasses clink)

16:57.417 --> 17:00.553
*

17:00.587 --> 17:02.922
(Snow Tha Product's
"Not Tonight")

17:02.955 --> 17:05.158
* Turn up the bass

17:05.192 --> 17:07.060
SNOW: * Babe
show me what you like *

17:07.094 --> 17:09.529
* Ay, I put money
I can match it for ya *

17:09.562 --> 17:11.764
* I'm in this (...)
and don't wife it *

17:11.798 --> 17:14.401
* Looking like a brick and all
them zippers on a jacket on ya *

17:14.434 --> 17:16.769
* He got a thang
for a Latin chick *

17:16.803 --> 17:18.905
* He wanna hear
a little Spanish *

17:18.938 --> 17:20.373
* I told 'em it ain't (...)
to practice it *

17:20.407 --> 17:23.343
(pounds table)

17:23.376 --> 17:25.278
SNOW: * Walk up with the clique
and I ain't *

17:25.312 --> 17:27.380
* Looking like the side in this
I'm the opposite *

17:27.414 --> 17:28.748
* 'Cause I'm the main event
And bossin' in it *

17:28.781 --> 17:30.450
* As the time been tickin'

17:30.483 --> 17:32.585
* Now I'm 'bout to
block the hit *

17:32.619 --> 17:34.554
* Some day, some day,
some time I'll find someone *

17:34.587 --> 17:37.023
* Someone to tell me I'm
somewhat, somewhat *

17:37.056 --> 17:39.926
* Doing all right,
doing all right *

17:39.959 --> 17:41.861
* Somewhere, somewhere
I'ma find me that *

17:41.894 --> 17:43.796
* Someone, someone
that somebody that *

17:43.830 --> 17:45.198
* One day, one day
will be the love of my *

17:45.232 --> 17:46.566
* Life, love of my life

17:46.599 --> 17:48.401
* But not tonight though

17:48.435 --> 17:50.437
* Hey,
I'm only here for a minute *

17:50.470 --> 17:52.539
* Bet you want a girl
that keep it hella independent *

17:52.572 --> 17:54.241
* I know you gotta like
a girl that this appealing *

17:54.274 --> 17:56.109
* If you caught up
in the moment *

17:56.143 --> 17:58.245
* Then I'll get you
in your feelings *

17:58.278 --> 18:00.447
* Tell your boys that
you gonna meet 'em later on *

18:00.480 --> 18:01.914
* Both of us are drunk
so, taxi, leave the meter on *

18:01.948 --> 18:03.716
* First time you out in Cali

18:03.750 --> 18:05.652
* Never tried
no weed this strong *

18:05.685 --> 18:07.420
* So you gonna have
some stories to tell *

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
* When you take your ass
back home *

* One time, one time
Snowy-owie show you *

18:11.591 --> 18:13.726
* What it's like leave

18:13.760 --> 18:15.795

* Get your (...) you gotta go I

-* All right
-* Turn up the bass!

18:28.341 --> 18:31.344
(indistinct chatter)

18:35.047 --> 18:36.649
(door slams)

18:40.853 --> 18:42.789
Let's go.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.006
(tense music)

19:00.039 --> 19:07.046
*

19:32.839 --> 19:34.741
MADDOG: Camila Vargas.

19:37.076 --> 19:40.012
Always heard
you were a scary bitch.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.983
What do you want?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.818
Let's start

19:45.852 --> 19:48.221
with whatever you have.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.691
Make it weekly.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.061
Call your friends.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.098
I don't have any friends.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.169
Sorry.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.538
I can't help you girls.

20:05.572 --> 20:09.008
(ominous dramatic music)

20:09.041 --> 20:10.610
(soft scoff)

20:12.712 --> 20:14.213
Wrong answer.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.748
Excuse me?

20:15.782 --> 20:16.849
(blow lands)

20:16.883 --> 20:19.552
(grunts)

20:19.586 --> 20:21.288
(yelping)

20:21.321 --> 20:24.524
(tense music)

20:24.557 --> 20:26.926
*

20:26.959 --> 20:29.596
MADDOG:
"I can't help you girls."

20:29.629 --> 20:31.598
You think you're talking
to your puta daughter?

20:31.631 --> 20:34.601
*

20:34.634 --> 20:35.635
(yells)

20:35.668 --> 20:37.470
(blows land)

20:37.504 --> 20:39.071
(yelps)

20:39.105 --> 20:41.441
(both grunting)

20:51.017 --> 20:54.287
(choking, crying)

20:54.321 --> 20:55.788
You're dead now, bitch.

20:55.822 --> 21:01.394
*

21:01.428 --> 21:04.497
Looks like somebody
fucked you up, esa.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.666
She's with us.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.569
(dramatic music)

21:09.602 --> 21:12.171
Drop the shiv.
Leave.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.974
Before I put it in your eye!

21:15.007 --> 21:22.014
*

21:27.954 --> 21:29.356
Thank you.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.290
Thank Teresa Mendoza.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.461
She hooked this up.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.228
(speaking Spanish)

21:38.164 --> 21:40.066
Never better.

21:45.171 --> 21:49.609
Yes, Colonel, please invite
all your men to the celebration.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.344
Listen, I'll have to
call you back.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.745
(phone beeps)

22:00.987 --> 22:03.456
Oh, no!
Mi'ja! Mi'ja!

22:03.490 --> 22:05.191
(dramatic music)

22:05.224 --> 22:06.292
Isabela.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.660
No, mi'ja, no.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.362
-I'm here now.
-(moans)

22:09.396 --> 22:12.799
*

22:12.832 --> 22:14.967
Oh.
Mi'ja, no.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.903
(speaks Spanish)

22:16.936 --> 22:19.305
(soft groan)

22:19.338 --> 22:26.145
*

22:26.178 --> 22:28.648
(groans)

22:28.681 --> 22:31.518
(somber music)

22:31.551 --> 22:38.257
*

22:38.290 --> 22:39.826
That.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.260
What's the matter with you?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.429
(breathes shakily)

22:42.462 --> 22:43.863
Sorry.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.532
I'm sorry.
It--it's okay.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.267
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.537
Listen.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.408
Listen.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.910
I'm giving it all up.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.278
The entire business.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.614
I'll just be governor,

23:01.648 --> 23:03.583
and your father.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.018
There will be no more crocodiles

23:06.052 --> 23:08.087
for you to ever worry about.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.757
I'm gonna do everything right.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.625
Huh?

23:15.562 --> 23:18.531
(somber music broods)

23:18.565 --> 23:22.034
When I was little,

23:22.068 --> 23:25.805
like five or six,

23:25.838 --> 23:28.975
I--I used to
stare out that window.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.045
And you would ask me
what I was thinking.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.714
I remember.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.182
(sniffles)

23:39.318 --> 23:41.020
I used to love that.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.392
Tell me, mi'ja,

23:46.425 --> 23:48.928
what is it that you are
thinking about now?

23:48.961 --> 23:50.830
-Hm?
-(sniffles)

23:50.863 --> 23:52.331
Mom.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.602
(cries)

23:55.635 --> 23:57.670
When Cortez took her,

23:57.704 --> 24:00.172
I thought he was gonna kill her.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.509
I was so scared.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.979
Lately,

24:07.013 --> 24:09.482
everything just hurts.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.785
You just rest, hm?

24:12.819 --> 24:16.288
I'll just sit here
right next to you.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.191
(softly)
You just rest.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.771
Here's payment for next week,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.105
in case you're still in.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.041
The homies got you covered.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.509
Them bitches know not to

24:36.543 --> 24:38.344
even fuckin' look at
Camila Vargas again.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.012
Thank you.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.514
And about that Arizona thing,

24:41.548 --> 24:43.516
I talked to my uncle
Big Travieso.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.784
Your uncle's the boss?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.653
(scoffs)
El mero mero.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.487
He took care of me
when my moms got shot.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.523
I'm sorry.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.458
Not as sorry as
the piece-of-trash

24:52.491 --> 24:53.826
puto that shot her.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.695
But Big T's down to talk.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.496
He's been trying to mess with
the cartels for a minute now.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.231
Okay, I'll let you know.

24:59.265 --> 25:02.134
And thank you again
for taking care of Camila.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.870
She won't forget it.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.805
Neither will I.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.407
Camila's lucky to have you.
You one bad bitch.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.342
See you soon.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.482
-God, are you okay?
-Yes.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.051
Starting to
feel like myself again.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.519
What happened?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.322
Some girls tried to kill me.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.893
And then the women
Teresa arranged to protect me,

25:26.926 --> 25:29.061
they did their job.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.230
I'm running out
of ways to thank you.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.733
Just glad you're okay.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.735
Where are we with Devon?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.705
-I spoke with him...
-You spoke with him?

25:38.738 --> 25:40.907
Yeah.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.175
He was worried
about you being in prison.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.277
But the deal was too good.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.513
And his first payment
is on the way.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.683
He'll take the rest
of the metric ton in a week.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.686
$30 million.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.321
Well done.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.924
Yeah.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.294
JAMES: We got some bad news.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.230
Boaz hit King George.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.032
Killed some of his men and
stole a quarter of the shipment.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.268
We need George's boats
to make good on the deal.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.705
I trust you struck back.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.741
We don't want our rivals
to think we're weak.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.810
We don't have the resources
to go to war right now.

26:17.844 --> 26:20.312
So I sat down with him,
came to some terms.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.281
We're good.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.483
You came to terms?

26:24.516 --> 26:27.754
He's gonna stay out of our area.
We won't expand into his.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.421
Gets them off us,
so we can operate

26:29.455 --> 26:31.891
until we decide
what we want to do next.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.326
So he basically
gave you permission

26:34.360 --> 26:36.162
to do what
we were already doing.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.730
You've got enough
going on in here.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.132
What I did, I did
to protect your interests.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.301
I'm so fortunate
I had Epifanio

26:42.334 --> 26:45.537
and now you to do that.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.008
I will clean up

26:49.041 --> 26:51.243
the mess with Boaz
when I get out.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.579
And until then,

26:53.612 --> 26:55.648
I want you
to transport the money

26:55.682 --> 26:57.750
that Teresa secured from Devon.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.019
Keep the trains moving.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.689
And no more judgment calls.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.966
What's going on?

27:16.202 --> 27:18.771
I told you to sit tight.
You run to Devon.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.339
I tell you I've got
Camila's protection.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.708
You go behind my back

27:21.741 --> 27:23.009
and make deals with hoodrats.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.711
And it worked.

27:24.744 --> 27:28.180
Where were your people
when they jumped her?

27:28.214 --> 27:29.548
Devon is our money.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.183
She said she wanted that
locked down.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.219
She's not thinking straight.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.687
I've been protecting her
since you were

27:34.721 --> 27:36.622
scrambling for change
in Culiacán,

27:36.655 --> 27:37.857
waiting for that
pretty boy pilot

27:37.890 --> 27:40.059
to show up and save your ass.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.461
Is this about business
or something else?

27:42.494 --> 27:45.865
I chose Camila.
You chose Guero.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.867
You know,

27:47.900 --> 27:50.302
Camila likes you
because she can control you.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.838
But the truth is,

27:51.871 --> 27:54.340
you are a sloppy,
inexperienced girl

27:54.373 --> 27:56.909
who lets her emotions
affect her judgment.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.644
No.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.747
You're upset because
I work with Camila.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.381
And you work for her.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.983
(cell phone rings)
That's what you think.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.718
-Hello?
-Teresa, it's Kelly Anne,

28:05.752 --> 28:07.419
um, Cole's wife.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.221
Uh, listen,
I know this is out of the blue,

28:09.255 --> 28:11.157
but you need to come to my house
as soon as you can.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.760
Kelly Anne, I'm sorry, but
this is really not a good time--

28:13.793 --> 28:15.661
Teresa, please, I need you to
come see what I found right now

28:15.694 --> 28:17.496
or you might end up in prison.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.532
(dramatic music)

28:27.106 --> 28:29.375
(cheering)
(mariachi music playing)

28:29.408 --> 28:36.282
*

28:36.315 --> 28:39.852
(scattered cheerful yelping)

28:39.886 --> 28:42.789
(cheers and applause)

28:48.961 --> 28:51.931
(speaking Spanish)

28:57.970 --> 29:00.773
(chattering in Spanish)

29:07.613 --> 29:09.548
(scattered cheers)

29:09.581 --> 29:12.251
(scattered applause)

29:12.284 --> 29:15.454
(singing "Despedida" in Spanish)

29:17.689 --> 29:20.626
(scattered cheers and applause)

29:25.031 --> 29:28.600
So we are in agreement over
the terms we have discussed.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.002
Estamos.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.437
(Cortez continues singing)

29:31.470 --> 29:33.272
Your wife's product,

29:33.305 --> 29:35.474
excellent.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.111
Don't worry.

29:39.145 --> 29:42.781
Shipment from La Paz
has been interrupted.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.952
We didn't hurt nobody.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.287
That mattered.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.924
(singing Spanish)

29:51.958 --> 29:58.965
*

30:03.369 --> 30:04.436
(cheers and applause)

30:04.470 --> 30:07.106
(cheers)

30:07.139 --> 30:09.241
(scattered cheers)

30:11.010 --> 30:13.479
Come on, hurry.
Get in.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.283
(papers rustling)

30:17.316 --> 30:18.650
What is this?

30:18.684 --> 30:20.719
These are the
ownership documents

30:20.752 --> 30:23.856
filed in the Cayman Islands
for Camila's Trawler company.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.858
TERESA: Why is my name
all over these?

30:25.892 --> 30:27.393
Because, uh...
(soft laugh)

30:27.426 --> 30:29.896
According to this,
you own Colibri Trawlers.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.797
(music broods)

30:31.830 --> 30:33.165
I never signed these papers.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.633
This has to be fake.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.801
Well, it's overseas,
but it's a legit,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.003
legal-filed corporation,

30:37.036 --> 30:39.538
and they can hang you with this.

30:39.571 --> 30:40.873
Camila's trying to set you up

30:40.907 --> 30:42.141
to take the fall
for her business.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.409
(dramatic music)

30:43.442 --> 30:44.877
Why are you showing this to me?

30:44.911 --> 30:48.247
We're both in deep shit
because of them.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.516
I figure maybe we
can help each other out.

30:50.549 --> 30:53.219
*

30:53.252 --> 30:55.254
This had to be Cole.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.190
*

30:58.224 --> 30:59.325
KELLY ANNE: Oh, God, he's home.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.426
He's supposed to be at work.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.593
Come on.
Go-go-go.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.495
*

31:03.529 --> 31:07.333
Whoa, no-no-no!
There's an alarm.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.935
Listen to me.
You go out there.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.103
Disarm the alarm
and distract him, okay?

31:11.137 --> 31:13.672
-That's--
-Please, Kelly Anne, go.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.174
-Okay, okay.
-Just go.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.543
(footsteps recede)

31:23.215 --> 31:25.217
(beeping)

31:26.818 --> 31:28.620
(beeping)
(door opens)

31:30.622 --> 31:32.191
Hey, what's going on, darling?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.026
You look a little flushed.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.962
No, I j--
I thought you had that meeting.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.297
So I didn't think you were gonna
be home till later tonight.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.699
Well, surprising my bride
should be a good thing.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.302
-(soft laugh)
-Come here.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.112
(soft laugh)

31:53.145 --> 31:54.947
Ow.
Ow!

31:54.981 --> 31:57.749
-Let go of my--
-Why is my office alarm off?

31:57.783 --> 31:59.418
-Let me--
-Why? Why?

31:59.451 --> 32:00.452
Who have you been talking to?

32:00.486 --> 32:01.620
Let go of me.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.123
TERESA: Let her go.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.325
I said let her go.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.328
(brooding dramatic music)

32:09.361 --> 32:14.666
*

32:14.700 --> 32:17.069
You set me up.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.237
(scoffs)

32:18.270 --> 32:19.805
You're as clueless as she is.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.141
Set you up?

32:22.174 --> 32:24.310
That was your boss's idea.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.911
What about the other paperwork
in Camila's name?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.446
That's to protect me.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.581
See, you and I,
we work for the same person.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.583
And only one of us
is stupid enough

32:31.617 --> 32:33.319
to think that Camila

32:33.352 --> 32:35.454
won't throw you to the wolves
to save her own ass.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.589
-Don't call her stupid--
-Bitch!

32:37.623 --> 32:40.292
(exhales)
The only thing your ungrateful,

32:40.326 --> 32:41.927
traitorous ass needs to do

32:41.960 --> 32:43.795
is pack your shit now,

32:43.829 --> 32:45.931
or pray she kills me.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.935
*

32:49.968 --> 32:52.604
Let's talk turkey.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.274
Maybe we put the gun down,

32:55.307 --> 32:57.476
figure a way out
for all parties involved.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.145
(gun fires)

32:59.178 --> 33:00.446
(gasps)

33:00.479 --> 33:02.481
(brooding music)

33:02.514 --> 33:06.485
(breathing shakily)

33:06.518 --> 33:08.554
(gun drops)

33:09.688 --> 33:13.625
(crying shakily)

33:13.659 --> 33:20.666
*

33:21.767 --> 33:24.636
(cheering)
(mariachi music playing)

33:24.670 --> 33:27.039
Felicidades, Colonel.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.510
(both speaking Spanish)

33:32.544 --> 33:34.846
(coughing)

33:37.015 --> 33:38.717
Are you all right?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.086
Yes.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.821
It's--it's a lot
of excitement today.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.725
But I'll have plenty
of time to relax very soon.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.894
You know,

33:48.927 --> 33:51.397
I still cannot comprehend

33:51.430 --> 33:54.266
how do you walk away
from your life's work?

33:54.300 --> 33:57.503
My life's work's
my family.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.706
And their failures
are my own.

34:00.739 --> 34:04.009
You are far
too hard on yourself, compa.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.845
You once called Camila

34:06.878 --> 34:08.580
my weakness.

34:08.614 --> 34:12.017
And you were correct, Colonel.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.454
Had anyone else done
the things that Camila did

34:15.487 --> 34:17.923
on our so-called war,

34:17.956 --> 34:20.259
the solution
would have been obvious.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.862
Get rid of her once and for all.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.366
My heart didn't let me do this.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.902
But apparently your
sicarios in Dallas

34:30.936 --> 34:32.738
had no such obstacle.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.040
The word I received
is that they tried to

34:35.073 --> 34:37.543
take her life.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.613
So you think I defied you
by ordering this.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.649
Oh, no.
No, my friend.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.951
I've seen you in action.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.755
If you had truly
wanted her death,

34:49.788 --> 34:52.158
it would have happened.

34:52.191 --> 34:56.428
(both speaking Spanish)

34:56.462 --> 34:57.963
(coughs)

34:57.996 --> 35:00.266
We all die at some point.

35:00.299 --> 35:06.938
*

35:08.840 --> 35:10.276
(laughs)

35:10.309 --> 35:13.011
(speaking Spanish)

35:17.383 --> 35:19.618
(speaking Spanish)

35:19.651 --> 35:21.753
(coughs)

35:21.787 --> 35:23.455
Epi.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.956
(coughing)

35:24.990 --> 35:27.193
Okay, we need some help
in here right now.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.828
No-no-no-no, I don't want to
dampen the celebration.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.497
(coughs)

35:31.530 --> 35:34.466
I just need to
get some fresh air.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.036
(mariachi music continues)

35:38.069 --> 35:45.076
*

35:47.813 --> 35:49.315
(speaking Spanish)

35:52.884 --> 35:56.322
(brass mariachi music)

35:56.355 --> 35:58.690
-(grunts)
-(grunting)

35:58.724 --> 36:00.359
(gunfire)

36:00.392 --> 36:02.127
(men screaming)

36:02.160 --> 36:04.996
(groans)

36:05.030 --> 36:08.634
(gunfire)

36:08.667 --> 36:11.237
(screams)

36:14.273 --> 36:17.643
(muffled screaming and gunfire)

36:17.676 --> 36:18.944
(pistol fires)

36:20.579 --> 36:23.515
(horse nickers)

36:23.549 --> 36:25.817
(gunfire)

36:25.851 --> 36:29.187
*

36:35.894 --> 36:38.530
I can't have this mess.
(soft laugh)

36:38.564 --> 36:41.032
'Cause Cole--he's--he's so--
he's just so damn anal.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.168
They get little spots
and he doesn't--he just--

36:43.201 --> 36:44.169
-he hates--
-Kelly Anne, you're okay.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.004
(glass shatters)

36:46.037 --> 36:48.039
(ambient music)

36:48.073 --> 36:50.676
They're all gonna come after me.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.845
Camila, the DEA, everybody,
they're all gonna come after me.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.714
And I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.517
Listen to me, okay?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.019
As soon as my friend is done,
you're gonna come with me.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.289
I will keep you safe.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.425
*

37:06.458 --> 37:08.294
You're gonna be fine.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.028
*

37:10.061 --> 37:13.265
Why would you do that for me?

37:13.299 --> 37:16.468
Because I know how to survive.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.103
Trust me.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.378
Nice shot for a gabacha.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.380
TERESA:
I need you to watch her for me.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.649
I have to speak to Camila
about this paperwork.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.285
You think she set you up.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.287
Why are you going there?

37:35.321 --> 37:37.323
I need to see it in her face.

37:37.356 --> 37:43.329
*

37:44.696 --> 37:47.966
(distant chatter)

37:56.675 --> 37:58.844
I'm glad you're here.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.351
You know, Cole hasn't
answered my phone calls,

38:05.384 --> 38:07.319
and that has me worried.

38:07.353 --> 38:10.088
Maybe you can reach out
to his wife?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.558
-Do something.
-I don't need to.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.894
She reached out to me.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.464
And?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.666
She found paperwork

38:20.699 --> 38:22.434
on some of your companies

38:22.468 --> 38:24.169
in a safe

38:24.202 --> 38:26.004
in Cole's office.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.006
Hm.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.508
(soft brooding music)

38:29.541 --> 38:31.577
He put everything in your name.

38:33.545 --> 38:37.549
Oh.
(very soft laugh)

38:37.583 --> 38:39.818
Why would he do that?

38:39.851 --> 38:43.054
I don't know.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.157
Maybe he was just
trying to protect himself,

38:46.191 --> 38:48.660
in case the DEA came after him.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.531
Did she say anything else?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.669
Anything about
the trawler company?

38:57.703 --> 39:03.141
*

39:03.174 --> 39:04.743
No.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.945
That's all she said.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.649
I know that's the thing that

39:10.682 --> 39:13.184
would put you
in prison for life.

39:13.218 --> 39:16.154
*

39:16.187 --> 39:18.424
Should I have her look for it?

39:20.526 --> 39:22.994
No.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.997
The DEA is all over her.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.299
I want you to be safe.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.540
Why would Kelly Anne call you

39:34.573 --> 39:37.075
and show you all this?

39:37.108 --> 39:39.845
She thinks you're having
an affair with her husband.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.279
(scoffs)

39:41.312 --> 39:42.881
Are you?

39:42.914 --> 39:45.417
With my attorney?

39:45.451 --> 39:47.553
Never.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.921
I know better than that.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.190
And after everything
I've done for you,

39:52.223 --> 39:55.761
you should know better
than to ask me that.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.129
Teresa,

39:58.163 --> 40:01.232
I trust you more than anyone.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.803
I would never lie to you.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.906
(brooding music builds)

40:07.939 --> 40:09.541
I'm sorry.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.942
It's okay.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.379
These are stressful times.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.482
You've done well.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.984
I'm proud of you.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.587
(very soft laugh)

40:21.620 --> 40:23.922
I'll be out soon.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.958
There's so much work
to do together.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.395
Much to celebrate.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.131
I look forward to it.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.934
Yeah.
Me too.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.169
*

40:38.203 --> 40:40.005
I have to go.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.340
Take care.

40:42.373 --> 40:45.744
*

40:45.777 --> 40:48.480
Guard.

40:48.514 --> 40:51.449

40:51.483 --> 40:56.522
