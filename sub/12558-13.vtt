<i>OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST, HE
MURDERED HIS ENTIRE CREW.</i>

THIS IS HOW THEY
SUFFOCATED THEIR VICTIMS.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.824
IT WAS CALLED...BURKING.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.824
THINK OF THE AGONIES
THEY ENDURED.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.746
WHICH ONE'S HE
TALKING ABOUT?

02:45.832 --> 02:48.745
OH, SIR, ALL OF
THEM. ALL OF THEM.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.078
SURELY, lT-IT IS
HORRIBLE TO BE MURDERED,

02:52.172 --> 02:55.836
AS OUR VICTIM HERE COULD TELL
YOU lF-IF SHE COULD TALK.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.338
BUT TO MURDER!

02:58.428 --> 03:01.511
TO TAKE A LIFE
WITH YOUR HANDS

03:01.598 --> 03:04.306
AGAIN AN D AGAIN,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.849
AND NOT BE ABLE
TO STOP ONESELF.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.435
CAN YOU BEGIN TO IMAGINE
THE HORROR OF THAT?

03:13.568 --> 03:16.902
NO. TELL US
ABOUT IT.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.275
WELL, I CANNOT.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.129
WELL, NO ONE
KNOWS, YET,

03:33.463 --> 03:36.626
BUT IF HIS TORMENT
IS GREAT ENOUGH

03:36.717 --> 03:40.460
AND HE KILLS AS THESE
POOR CREATURES DID,

03:40.554 --> 03:44.092
THEN FUTURE

04:11.585 --> 04:13.167
AND LONELY WIDOWS.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.750
LANDRU WAS A MASTER
OF THE GARROTE.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.086
AND HE USED
A WAXED CORD

04:20.177 --> 04:22.418
IDENTICAL TO THE ONE
HE HOLDS THERE.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.423

04:27.476 --> 04:29.433
<i>THOSE FIGURES ARE
NOT TO BE TOUCHED.</i>

04:29.478 --> 04:32.345

BESIDES, THE MUSEUM
CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

MEN ARE DRl\/EN TO COMMIT MASS MURDER.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.734
WHAT MR. SENESCU
DOES NOT KNOW

06:02.821 --> 06:05.062
IS THAT THE GROUNDWORK
HAS ALREADY BEEN LAID

06:05.156 --> 06:07.773
FOR HIS OWN SPECIAL KIND
OF MADNESS AND TORMENT,

06:07.868 --> 06:11.031
FOUND ONLY IN

06:42.777 --> 06:44.814
I'D LIKE TO TALK
WITH YOU.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.988
OH, WELL, I'LL BE
THROUGH IN A MOMENT.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.985
<i>THAT CAN WAIT.</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:52.568
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS RATHER IMPORTANT.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.703
OH, ALL RIGHT.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.789
YOU KNOW,
MR. FERGUSON,

06:57.876 --> 06:59.833
LANDRU NEEDS
A NEW SUIT.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.582
THIS ONE IS TEN YEARS
OLD, AND IT SHOVVS IT.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.792
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

07:03.882 --> 07:06.419
WELL, YES AND NO.

07:06.468 --> 07:10.302
I THINK WE'D BETTER
DISCUSS IT IN THE OFFICE.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.988
IS IT SOMETHING
I'VE DONE?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.867
OR HAVEN'T DONE?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.786
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.619
UH, SIT DOWN, MARTIN.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.337
MARTIN, I'M ABANDONING
THE MUSEUM.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.633
HM?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.462
ABANDONING?

07:53.515 --> 07:55.722
I'M AFRAID SO.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.720
OH.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.892
IS THIS A JOKE, SIR?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.720
NO.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.475
OH, MR. FERGUSON.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.357
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU MUSTN'T

08:06.444 --> 08:11.314
UH, I KNOVV HOVV YOU FEEL, MARTIN.
BELIEVE ME, I DO. BUT-

08:11.408 --> 08:13.570
I'M AFRAID THERE
ISN'T ANY CHOICE.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.823
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.579
L'\/E BEEN OFFERED A LARGE
SUM FOR THIS PROPERTY.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.910
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD
A-A SUPERMARKET HERE.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.665
A SUPERMARKET?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.706
HERE, LET ME GET YOU A DRINK.
IT'LL HELP SETTLE YOU.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.916
NO, NO, NO.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.297
NO. PLEASE, I DON'T--

08:39.811 --> 08:42.769
WHEN I FIRST OPENED
THE MUSEUM 3O YEARS AGO,

08:42.856 --> 08:46.440
<i>I NEVER DREAMED
I'D SEE THIS DAY.</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:50.026
BUT THE DAY IS
HERE, MARTIN.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.063
AND WE WILL JUST
HAVE TO FACE IT.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.068
THIRTY YEARS.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.871
WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.539
I KNOW.

09:02.584 --> 09:07.044
YOU'RE THE BEST EMPLOYEE
A MAN COULD EVER HAVE.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.206
THE WAY YOU'VE RUN
THE MURDERERS' ROW EXHIBIT.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.797
WHY, I DON'T THINK YOU
EVER MISSED A TOUR.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.299
NO, NO.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.971
I NEVER DID, NEVER.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.383
HOW MANY MORE DAYS?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.891
NONE.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.814
THIS WAS THE LAST.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.734
THEY BEGIN WRECKING
THE BUILDING NEXT WEEK.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.235
NO MORE TOURS?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.740
NONE AT ALL?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.402
I HAD TO AGREE TO IT.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.242
WHAT ABOUT
THE FIGURES?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.578
I HAVEN'T
DECIDED, YET.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.419
MR. FERGUSON,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.956
WE CAN OPEN
ANOTHER MUSEUM.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.338
VVE CAN MOVE EVERYTHING SOMEWHERE ELSE.
VVE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.762
NO, NO, l-l-l'M NOT AS
YOUNG AS I ONCE VVAS.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.180
UH, I NEED A REST.
FANNY AND I TALKED--

10:01.267 --> 10:03.520
DON'T, DON'T. I'LL DO
THE WORK. I MEAN IT.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.594
YOU VVON'T HA\/E TO DO A THING.
NOT A THING!

10:06.815 --> 10:10.604
I APPRECIATE THAT, MARTIN, AND I
KNOVV YOU'D BE A GREAT HELP, BUT-

10:10.693 --> 10:12.684
IT-IT WOULD BE FOOLISH.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.817
BUT WHY? WHY
WOULD IT BE FOOLISH?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.734
LET ME SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.285
WE ARE PASSE, MARTIN.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.452
PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED
IN WAX MUSEUMS ANYMORE.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.709
HERE. LOOK THROUGH IT.
IT'S ALL IN THERE.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.710
OUR ATTENDANCE FIGURES.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.634
OUR GAINS, BUT
MOSTLY OUR LOSSES.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.546
THIS LAST YEAR HAS
BEEN THE POOREST OF ALL.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.225
YOU'LL ALSO FIND A-A NEVVS STORY ABOUT
THE CLOSING OF THE GRAND GUIGNOL.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.599
A-A SIGN OF THE TIMES. THE-THE
HANDVVRITING ON THE VVALL.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.228
[quietly]
GRAND GUIGNOL.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.022
UH, SURE YOU
WON'T HAVE A DRINK?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.112
[whispers]
NO, THANK YOU.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.159
YOU-YOU SEE, MARTIN,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.919
THE-THE OUTSIDE WORLD

11:13.006 --> 11:15.919
OFFERS THEM FEARS
WE COULD NEVER MATCH.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.421
THE OVENS AT
BELSEN AND DACHAU

11:18.511 --> 11:20.843
HAVE RUINED OUR
CHAMBER OF HORRORS.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.223
PEOPLE ARE BLASE,
SOPHISTICATED.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.267
THEY THINK THEY'\/E OUTGROVVN
THE NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.095
THEY LIVE IN FEAR
DAY IN, DAY OUT.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.773
LT-IT'S THE WORLD, MARTIN.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.188
NO, NO, MARTIN,

11:36.237 --> 11:39.355
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH
TO OPEN ANOTHER MUSEUM.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.862
MR. FERGUSON, MAYBE--

11:44.245 --> 11:46.282
MAYBE THE LOCATION
IS WRONG.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.740
OR MAYBE, MAYBE IT'S THE VVAY VVE
HA\/E THE FIGURES EXHIBITED.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.293
YOU REMEMBER HOVV THE PEOPLE CAME VVHEN
VVE VVORKED OUT THE RIPPER'S ARM?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.792
YES. OH, BUT THAT
WAS YEARS AGO.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.550
MR. FERGUSON,

12:00.595 --> 12:04.964
YOU'RE NOT...THINKING OF
DESTROYING THEM, ARE YOU?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.799
THEY'RE MEANT
TO LIVE FOREVER.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.102
MARTIN, I TELL YOU, I DON'T
KNOVV VVHAT I'M GOING TO DO!

12:10.188 --> 12:12.475
YOU'RE FORGETTING
SOMETHING.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.556
FORGETTING
SOMETHING? WHAT?

12:14.609 --> 12:17.192
COME WITH ME. PLEASE.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.566
MARTIN!

12:24.577 --> 12:25.988

12:27.497 --> 12:30.080
MR. FERGUSON. PLEASE.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.579
LOOK AT HIM.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.206
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.753
LOOK AT HIS EYES.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.004
CAN'T YOU SEE THE SHY, FRIGHTENED
LITTLE CHOIR BOY THAT HE ONCE VVAS?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.213
<i>CAN'T YOU SEE THE BOOKKEEPER
WHO SO LONGED FOR FREEDOM'?</i>

12:47.642 --> 12:50.134
WHY, EVEN
HE FLESH FEELS REAL.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.593
WHY, IT'S LIKE FLESH.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.019
AND LOOK
AT THE MOUTH.

12:53.106 --> 12:57.100
JUST LOOK AT THE MOUTH. ISN'T
IT ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING?

12:57.151 --> 13:00.018
<i>WHY, LANDRU WAS A,
WAS AN ELOQUENT MAN.</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:02.275
<i>HE WAS FULL OF TENDERNESS.
AND IT'S THERE.</i>

13:02.323 --> 13:05.441
IT'S THERE. IT'S CAUGHT
RIGHT IN THE MOUTH.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.492
MARTIN, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO SAY?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.615
MR. FERGUSON, YOU
SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

13:09.664 --> 13:12.452
THAT THESE FIGURES ARE THE VVORK
OF THE GREAT HENRI GUILMONT.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.874
THE ONLY ONES HE CREATED
OUTSIDE OF EUROPE.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.123
NO, I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN THAT.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.624
MR. FERGUSON?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.173
I WANT TO BUY THEM.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.136
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

13:26.222 --> 13:28.805
I DON'T THINK I COULD BEAR IT IF
THESE FIGURES VVERE DESTROYED.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.138
IT WOULD-- IT VVOULD BE LIKE
LOSING FI\/E CLOSE FRIENDS.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.640
I WON'T DESTROY THEM,
MARTIN, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.938
BUT-BUT WHERE
WOULD I STORE THEM?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.814
I COULD PUT THEM IN MY BASEMENT.
YES, IT'S A PERFECT PLACE.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.736
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKE, MARTIN.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.860
WHAT WOULD EMMA SAY
TO HAVING THE FIGURES

13:45.950 --> 13:49.033
OF Fl\/E FAMOUS MURDERERS
IN HER BASEMENT?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.407
EMMA WOULDN'T MIND.
SHE WOULD UNDERSTAND.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.455
AND I VVOULD PUT AN AIR CONDITIONER
IN THERE. I TELL YOU THAT.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.581
AND A HEATER,
FOR THE COLDER DAYS.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.253
IWOULD TAKE

YOUR BREAKFAST.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.310

WHEN THEY GET HERE.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.899
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.189
HOW LONG ARE WE
GOING TO KEEP THEM?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.738
I HAVE PLANS TO OPEN
MY OWN MUSEUM.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.409
BUT I'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM
FROM MR. FERGUSON FIRST.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.703

HAPPENED TO THEM.

14:33.748 --> 14:37.116
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
MOVING FURNITURE.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.543
THEY SHOULD HAVE
LET ME RIDE WITH THEM.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.042

17:41.894 --> 17:44.636
OH, BUT EMMA,

17:44.730 --> 17:47.392

17:54.907 --> 17:57.399

<i>YOU TOLD ME THEY'D ONLY

18:24.020 --> 18:26.182
I'VE BEEN NICE
ABOUT IT, MARTIN.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.604
YOU CAN'T SAY

18:28.649 --> 18:32.688
BUT HOVV LONG AM I GOING TO BE
LOCKED OUT OF MY OVVN BASEMENT?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.610

SEE HOVV MUCH IT'S COSTING US

19:03.684 --> 19:06.221
TO KEEP THE AIR CONDITIONER
RUNNING DAY AND NIGHT.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.724
BUT YOU KNOW IT HAS
BEEN HOT DOWN HERE.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.227
OH.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.060
THAT IS HIGH, ISN'T IT?

19:15.154 --> 19:19.148

19:20.201 --> 19:23.660

19:47.436 --> 19:49.598
I DON'T THINK HE COULD
TAKE CARE OF THEM RIGHT,

19:51.607 --> 19:53.018

YOU THERE?</i>

41:21.145 --> 41:22.476
<i>MARTIN.</i>

41:24.023 --> 41:25.058
<i>MARTIN?</i>

41:25.149 --> 41:26.526
YES.

41:28.695 --> 41:31.528
OH, MR. FERGUSON.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.531
COME IN.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.154
MARTIN, HOW NICE
TO SEE YOU!

41:37.245 --> 41:40.829
NICE TO SEE YOU. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU. THE AIR CONDITIONER'S ON.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.205
YES, IT'S NICE
AND COOL DOWN HERE.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.329
YES.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.834
THERE THEY ARE.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.127
YES.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.920
AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.174
MARTIN, I-| CAN'T KEEP IT
FROM YOU ANY LONGER.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.212
WHAT, SIR?

41:57.306 --> 41:59.343
THE BEST NEWS
IN THE WORLD.

41:59.392 --> 42:04.853
MARTIN, OLD FRIEND, VVHEN I TOLD YOU THAT
NOBODY VVANTED TO BUY THESE FIGURES,

42:04.939 --> 42:07.180
I-| WAS BEING
TOO PESSIMISTIC.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.850
THE FACT IS,
SOMEBODY <i>DOES</i> WANT TO.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.231
BUT NOT JUST SOMEBODY.

42:13.156 --> 42:15.568
THE MARCHAND MUSEUM.

42:15.658 --> 42:16.898
OH.

42:16.993 --> 42:17.949
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

42:18.036 --> 42:18.525
YES.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.286
MARCHAND'S. IN BRUSSELS.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.955
L-| CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY, BUT--

42:24.042 --> 42:25.407
AREN'T YOU PLEASED?

42:25.501 --> 42:27.003
YES.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.212
MR. FERGUSON,
LOOK AT THE RIPPER.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.624
I MUST SAY, MARTIN, YOU
HAVE KEPT THEM UP WELL.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.959
YES. NOW, YOU SEE, THIS
NEEDS FIXING IN HERE.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.216
THE THREADS ARE
STARTING TO FALL OUT.

42:38.264 --> 42:42.007
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK
THEY ALL NEED NEVV CLOTHES.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.601
MAYBE IT IS TOO HUMID
IN HERE, AFTER ALL.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.804
WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.061
OH, AND I ASKED EMMA
TO SEW THIS RIP UP,

42:50.109 --> 42:52.146
BUT THERE'S BEEN
SO MANY THINGS TO DO.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.567
OH, BY THE WAY,
HOW IS EMMA?

42:53.654 --> 42:55.486
OH, SHE'S FINE.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.736
YOU HA\/E A REMARKABLE VVIFE, MARTIN.
THERE AREN'T MANY VVOMEN

42:58.785 --> 43:01.618
VVOULD PUT UP VVITH AN EXHIBIT
LIKE THIS IN THEIR BASEMENT.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.786
SHE NEVER COMPLAINS.

43:03.873 --> 43:07.161
OH, HAVE YOU BEEN
SLEEPING DOWN HERE?

43:07.251 --> 43:09.913
YES. OH!

43:10.004 --> 43:13.497
MR. FERGUSON, I CAME ACROSS
THIS LITTLE ITEM IN THIS BOOK

43:13.591 --> 43:15.798
THAT I WAS READING JUST
BEFORE I FELL ASLEEP.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.343
<i>MR. FERGUSON, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW EXOVYED WE USED TO GET</i>

43:18.429 --> 43:20.670
VVHEN VVE FOUND OUT SOME NEVV
THINGS ABOUT THE FIGURES?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.597
MARTIN, ARE-ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?

43:22.683 --> 43:24.390
YES.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.144
NO, MR. FERGUSON.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.724
IT ISN'T SO.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.018
I'M NOT ALL RIGHT.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.103
NO?

43:36.155 --> 43:37.395
NO.

43:38.908 --> 43:41.195
SOME STRANGE THINGS
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.026
STRANGE THINGS?

43:43.121 --> 43:44.862
YES.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.784
THEY HAVEN'T EXACTLY
BEEN BEHAVING THEMSELVES.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.703
WHO?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.131
OH, COME NOW.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.462
OH, IT'S TRUE,
I SWEAR IT.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.639
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN UP TO.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.472
OH, MARTIN. YOU'VE
BEEN SO CLOSE--

44:08.563 --> 44:08.973
[shh shh]

44:09.063 --> 44:10.565
[whispering]
YOU'VE BEEN SO CLOSE

44:10.648 --> 44:12.480
TO THESE FIGURES
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS,

44:12.567 --> 44:14.934
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO
I/I/IAG/NETHINGS ABOUT THEM.

44:15.027 --> 44:17.155
NO, NO, IT'S NOT
IMAGINATION. NOT AT ALL.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.062
WELL, THAT'S NEITHER
HERE NOR THERE.

44:19.157 --> 44:22.320
THE POINT IS, YOU VVON'T HA\/E
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM ANY LONGER.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.993
BUT MR. FERGUSON, I WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.539
I KNOW YOU DO.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.410
AND AS I'\/E SAID, I
APPRECIATE VVHAT YOU'VE DONE,

44:29.500 --> 44:31.411
BUT IT'S ALL SETTLED.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.756
OF COURSE, THERE'LL BE A
SUBSTANTIAL REWARD TO YOU

44:45.850 --> 44:48.933
FOR ALL THE YEARS
YOU'VE CARED FOR THEM.

44:49.020 --> 44:53.355
NOVV, VVHY DON'T YOU PREPARE
US A-A CUP OF TEA OR SOMETHING

44:53.441 --> 44:55.557

46:19.318 --> 46:22.652
MR. FERGUSON, I BROUGHT YOU
BOTH THE CREAM AND THE SUGAR.

MARTIN LOMBARD SENESCU,

49:30.009 --> 49:34.298
A REMARKABLE AND CERTAINLY
MOST VERSATILE MURDERER.

49:34.388 --> 49:37.676
<i>WHO KNOWS WHAT THOUGHTS
WENT THROUGH HIS MIND</i>

49:37.766 --> 49:40.019
AS HE DUG THE GRAVES
