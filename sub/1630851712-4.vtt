00:48.590 --> 00:50.133
Oh! Hi.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.051
It's raining outside today,

00:52.135 --> 00:56.055
so Pandy and I came up
with something to do inside.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.182
You want to see it?

00:57.766 --> 00:58.808
OK.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.477
Ta-da!

01:00.560 --> 01:03.271
Rainy-day rainbow paintings.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.566
See how the paint kind of looks like rain
when it hits the window?

01:06.649 --> 01:09.152
Do you want to see how we make it? OK.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.948
First, we put some watercolors
on the edge of the paper.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.453
Then you take a straw and blow!

01:29.130 --> 01:30.465
Colorful.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.426
You know what that sound means.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.678
It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery.
Come on.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.651
A rainy-day delivery
from the Meow Meow Mailbox.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.568
OK.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.238
Ooh!

01:53.321 --> 01:54.948
Check it out!

01:55.031 --> 01:59.828
Out Kitty Cat Surprise Box is covered
in lots of little raindrops.

01:59.911 --> 02:04.249
Hmm. Maybe there's something in here
that we can play with on a rainy day.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.917
Let's open it and see.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.295
It's a…

02:10.296 --> 02:12.257
sparkly banana?

02:12.882 --> 02:13.716
Hmm.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.219
How can we play with this?

02:16.845 --> 02:19.722
Maybe it could be…

02:19.806 --> 02:22.642
…a silly mustache.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.270
Ooh! Or a banana horn.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.772
Oh!

02:27.856 --> 02:31.943
Maybe I could wear it on my head as a hat.

02:44.956 --> 02:45.957
That's it!

02:46.040 --> 02:48.710
This is our Rainy Day Banana.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.336
When you put it on your head,

02:50.420 --> 02:53.381
it helps you think of something fun
to do on a rainy day.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.134
Ooh! Ring-ring! Ring-ring!

02:56.217 --> 02:59.470
I'm getting a Rainy Day Banana call.
Let's see.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.097
Hello?

03:01.723 --> 03:02.891
It's Cakey.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.518
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.646
OK, Cakey. We're on our way.

03:09.230 --> 03:13.526
He needs some help coming up with
a rainy-day idea in the kitchen. Let's go!

03:14.152 --> 03:16.154
Time to get tiny.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.664
Wahoo!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.334
We're in the kitchen. Come on in!

03:30.710 --> 03:32.795
Welcome to the Dollhouse.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.547
OK, first things first.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.799
We need to figure out
where Pandy is hiding.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.679
He's not here.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.852
-Aww!

03:48.770 --> 03:49.854
Not here, either.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.982
Hmm. Do you see Pandy?

03:56.736 --> 03:57.570
Hmm.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.614
Hug attack!

04:01.157 --> 04:02.533
That was a good one.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.452
Let's see.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.414
We could reorganize the spice rack.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.375
Boring!

04:12.085 --> 04:14.212
Hi, Cakey. Hey, CatRat.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.006
What's wrong, CatRat?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.800
It's raining.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.260
We can't go outside

04:20.343 --> 04:22.303
and there's nothing to do.

04:23.346 --> 04:28.184
Sorry, CatRat. It is still raining,
and I know you don't like getting wet.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.147
But there's lots of things
we could do inside.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.317
Well, Cakey and I have been trying
to think of something,

04:36.401 --> 04:38.945
but it all sounds boring.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.989
Yeah, we've got nothing.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.241
Well, as a matter of fact,

04:43.324 --> 04:45.702
I've got something right here
in my backpack.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.120
Ta-da!

04:47.203 --> 04:49.956
Rainy Day Banana!

04:50.039 --> 04:51.249
-Oh!
-Oh!

04:51.332 --> 04:53.293
-Sparkly.
-What?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.086
A banana?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.671
Not just any banana.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.299
This is a Rainy Day Banana.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.719
It helps you come up with great ideas
for things to do on a rainy day.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.012
Really?

05:04.095 --> 05:08.725
Yeah! You just put it on your head
and wait until you get a great idea.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.518
Now, that's just silly.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.312
Give it a try, CatRat.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.731
Put it on your head.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.235
Uh, I don't see how this is gonna work.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.988
That's because
we didn't sing the song yet.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.823
Pfft! There's a song?

05:23.906 --> 05:26.534
Yep. It goes like this.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.796
Any ideas coming?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.632
Oh, hang on.
I think I'm getting something.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.761
An idea's coming in. Mm-hmm.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.471
I've got it!

05:46.554 --> 05:48.097
What's your idea, CatRat?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.558
-My idea is…

05:50.641 --> 05:51.642
…let's eat it.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.936
-Huh?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.313
CatRat!

05:55.396 --> 05:58.149
The Rainy Day Banana isn't a real banana.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.443
-We can't eat it.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.445
I told you this thing wouldn't work.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.905
Now, hang on.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.115
We can't eat the Rainy Day Banana,

06:06.199 --> 06:07.450
but…

06:08.534 --> 06:12.705
…I've got a whole bowl
of yummy bananas we can eat right here.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.500
We can make CatRat's silly banana snacks.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.753
CatRat's silly banana snacks.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.213
I like it!

06:20.296 --> 06:21.798
See that, CatRat?

06:21.881 --> 06:25.051
The Rainy Day Banana
helped you come up with a great idea.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.345
Sprinkle-riffic!

06:29.972 --> 06:32.767
I've got lots of things
we can mix with bananas

06:32.850 --> 06:34.560
to make silly snacks.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.854
What have you got, Cakey?

06:39.774 --> 06:40.775
-Bread.
-Oh!

06:41.984 --> 06:42.985
Pretzel sticks.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.946
Whoa! Gotcha.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.406
Blueberries,

06:47.490 --> 06:48.991
strawberries,

06:49.075 --> 06:50.201
raisins,

06:50.827 --> 06:51.702
and…

06:51.786 --> 06:52.787
Hmm.

06:52.870 --> 06:56.249
What can we use
to stick all the ingredients together?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.839
Sunflower butter!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.090
Great idea.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.801
Here you go, Gabby.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.928
Thanks. Whoa!

07:15.435 --> 07:16.352
OK.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.814
The rules
for CatRat's silly banana snack are,

07:19.897 --> 07:25.069
you can mix any of these ingredients
with your banana to make a silly snack.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.487
-Everybody ready?
-Yep.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.364
-I'm ready.
-Can't wait.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.324
Everybody has a banana?

07:31.075 --> 07:32.785
And go!

07:42.128 --> 07:43.212
-Bread.
-Pretzels.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.130
Blueberries.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.383
-Strawberries.
-Raisins.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.301
Sunflower butter.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.308
Bananas.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.566
-Time's up! Silly snacks down.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.817
OK.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.820
Cakey, what kind of silly banana snack
did you make?

08:07.904 --> 08:12.325
I made a little owl with big banana eyes.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.160
"Moo! Moo!"

08:14.243 --> 08:15.870
Uh, Cakey?

08:15.953 --> 08:19.749
I think owls say, "Hoo!" not, "Moo!"

08:19.832 --> 08:20.666
Yes.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.668
But this owl is silly,

08:22.752 --> 08:25.379
so she says, "Moo!"

08:25.463 --> 08:27.089
Ha! A silly snack!

08:27.173 --> 08:29.342
That's a good one.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.678
An owl that says, "Moo!"

08:32.762 --> 08:34.597
Gabby, what did you make?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.390
I made a banana-pillar.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.476
Check out his little raisin shoes.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.605
A banana-pillar! That's silly.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.399
Let's see your silly banana snack, Pandy.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.776
Ta-da!

08:46.859 --> 08:48.611
A banana alien.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.820
Ooh!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.573
Look at all those cool banana eyes.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.284
-I see you, Cakey!

08:55.368 --> 08:59.455
OK, CatRat, you're up.
What silly banana snack did you make?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.041
I made the CatRat.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.335
Hoo-hoo! Hello, handsome!

09:04.418 --> 09:07.004
Oh, that's a good one!

09:07.088 --> 09:09.966
Handsome and silly.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.886
Well, I hate to eat myself,
but I'm hungry.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.304
Let's eat.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.724
Hey, Cakey,
want to try a little bite of CatRat?

09:18.808 --> 09:20.935
Thanks, CatRat.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.313
Mm! Delicious!

09:26.274 --> 09:30.027
-This was the best rainy-day snack ever!
-Mm-hmm!

09:30.611 --> 09:32.280
Ring-ring! Ring-ring!

09:32.363 --> 09:34.865
Oh, I'm getting a Rainy Day Banana call.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.159
Hello? What's that, you say?

09:37.785 --> 09:39.954
Baby Box needs help in the craft room?

09:40.496 --> 09:42.331
OK, we're on our way.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.542
What's going on?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.836
It sounds like Baby Box
could use some help

09:46.919 --> 09:48.963
coming up with a rainy-day craft idea.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.173
Well, what are we waiting for?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.342
To the craft room!

09:53.968 --> 09:55.219
Bye, Cakey.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.596
Good luck!

10:03.102 --> 10:04.103
We're here.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.188
Hey, Baby Box.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.317
-Hi, guys!
-What are you making?

10:09.400 --> 10:13.362
Well, since it's raining outside,
I thought I'd do some crafting.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.906
But I can't think of anything to make.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.910
Well, do we have something for you.
Show her, Gabby.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.454
Ta-da!

10:21.537 --> 10:22.622
What is it?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.332
It's a Rainy Day Banana.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.542
A Rainy Day Banana?

10:26.626 --> 10:31.589
Yeah! It helps you come up with ideas
for things to do on a rainy day.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.342
Just pop it on your head
and give it a try.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.426
On my head?

10:35.509 --> 10:39.055
Trust me. I was skeptical, but it works.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.890
Okey-dokey.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.853
Let's sing "The Rainy Day Banana Song"
to Baby Box.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.201
That's a funny song.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.662
So, are you getting any ideas?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.042
I got a great idea!

11:13.089 --> 11:15.758
-What's she making?
-We'll have to wait and see.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.597
It's… Super-Banana!

11:22.223 --> 11:24.475
Whoa! Paw-tastic!

11:24.558 --> 11:28.938
That's a pretty super craft idea,
Baby Box.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.439
Thanks.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.692
But Super-Banana
is only a part of my idea.

11:33.776 --> 11:38.572
We can use the art supplies
to craft up a whole Super-Banana story.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.866
Oh, yeah. With a bad guy.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.078
And… And someone for Super-Banana to save.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.039
I can craft up a bad guy, no problem.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.546
Nyah! It's Mr. Marker.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.590
I'm the baddest bad guy in Craft Town.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.677
Cheep-cheep!

11:59.760 --> 12:01.011
And meet Pom-Pom,

12:01.095 --> 12:04.014
the sweetest little chickadoodle
in Craft Town.

12:04.098 --> 12:04.932
Cheep-cheep!

12:05.516 --> 12:08.644
-Aww! He's so cute!
-Thanks.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.189
Super-Banana
needs to save Pom-Pom because…

12:12.273 --> 12:13.482
Hmm.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.692
Oh!

12:14.775 --> 12:17.153
…he's trapped on top of a high building.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.737
I can make a building.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.994
One tall building, stacking up.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.377
Help!

12:33.461 --> 12:36.922
Cheep-cheep!
I'm trapped on top of this tall building!

12:37.006 --> 12:40.342
Don't worry, Pom-Pom.
I'll save you.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.099
Pandy, Super-Banana needs something

12:47.183 --> 12:50.019
to help her climb up
to the top of the building.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.103
I'm on it!

12:52.730 --> 12:56.400
We need something Super-Banana
can throw up to the top of the building

12:56.484 --> 12:58.861
to help her climb up there, like a rope.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.240
What should we use?

13:06.952 --> 13:07.786
The yarn!

13:09.455 --> 13:10.456
Thanks.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.667
How about a ball of yarn?

13:13.751 --> 13:15.044
That's perfect!

13:15.127 --> 13:16.462
Gabby, catch!

13:18.088 --> 13:20.382
I'm coming to save you, Pom-Pom!

13:20.466 --> 13:22.259
Yay! Cheep-cheep!

13:27.765 --> 13:31.644
Never fear,
Super-Banana is here!

13:31.727 --> 13:33.646
I'm saved! Cheep-cheep!

13:35.564 --> 13:38.275
You're not saved yet, Pom-Pom.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.156
Oh, no! How will Super-Banana
and Pom-Pom chick get down?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.157
Cheep-cheep!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.159
-I know.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.038
Every superhero needs their flying cape.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.874
Hey, Super-Banana, you forgot your cape.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.169
Thank you, Pandy.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.880
I mean, good citizen of Craft Town.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.924
Come on, Pom-Pom.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.968
Let's fly.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.637
-Whoa!
-Gotcha!

14:06.720 --> 14:07.972
-Yeah!
-Whoosh!

14:08.055 --> 14:12.685
Whee!

14:13.811 --> 14:16.438
Super-Banana saved Pom-Pom!

14:16.522 --> 14:19.066
Hooray for Super-Banana!

14:23.362 --> 14:26.073
That was an a-meow-zing story.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.701
You really came up with
a great idea, Baby Box.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.952
Thanks.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.746
And thanks to Super-Banana.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.876
I mean, Rainy Day Banana.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.006
Well, it's still raining outside.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.633
Ring-ring! Ring-ring!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.177
It's another Rainy Day Banana call.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.095
Hello?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.306
DJ Catnip, you say?

14:50.848 --> 14:53.684
OK. We'll head on down to the music room.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.979
-To the music room!

14:57.062 --> 14:59.773
Thanks for the craft-y-riffic time,
Baby Box.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.108
You're welcome.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.825
Plop. Plop. Plop. Plop.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.289
-What's up, Catnip?
-Oh, hey, kitty cats.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.249
Are you making up a new song?

15:17.333 --> 15:21.337
I've just been playing along to the rain
but, to be honest with you,

15:21.420 --> 15:24.882
I'm having a hard time coming up
with an idea of what to do next.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.552
Maybe the Rainy Day Banana
can help you come up with a good idea.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.346
A Rainy Day what?

15:30.429 --> 15:31.972
Let me see that thing.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.272
Ooh! This thing is cool!

15:40.356 --> 15:43.275
It's even cooler
when you put it on your head.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.652
On my head?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.737
Are you kitten with me, Pandy?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.447
No, really!

15:48.530 --> 15:50.157
When you put it on your head,

15:50.240 --> 15:54.036
it helps you come up with ideas
for things to do on a rainy day.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.454
I'll give it a shot.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.290
You get a little song, too.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.627
Ooh! You know I love a song.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.253
Sing it with us.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.975
Hmm.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.603
Hey, this banana just gave me
the grooviest idea.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.688
What is it?

16:23.983 --> 16:24.817
Yes!

16:24.900 --> 16:29.238
Uh, are you sure about that one?
Maybe you should try it again.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.698
Come on, CatRat.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.659
Whee!

16:33.742 --> 16:36.245
Hmm. Whoa!

16:37.121 --> 16:39.665
Have you ever been
to a Banana Dance Party?

16:43.252 --> 16:46.338
Nope.
Definitely never been to one of those.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.799
Trust me, CatRat. You're gonna love it.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.635
Let's all go to the Banana Dance Party.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.350
All right, everybody.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.770
Who's ready to do the banana peel?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.231
-We are.
-Let's do it!

17:04.314 --> 17:05.482
CatRat?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
If I must.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.280
It goes a little something like this.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.036
Phew! Bananas sure can dance.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.621
That was cat-tastic!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.169
Come on, CatRat.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.545
It's time to split.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.380
It's over?

18:10.464 --> 18:13.050
I was just getting
my banana groove on.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.099
Thanks for the Banana Dance Party,
DJ Catnip.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.892
That was a great idea.

18:21.975 --> 18:26.396
Yeah, well, the Rainy Day Banana
really inspired me on that one.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.944
-Hey, look! It's stopped raining!
-And the sun is coming out!

18:32.027 --> 18:33.987
Ring-ring! Ring-ring!

18:34.071 --> 18:36.657
And I'm getting a Rainy Day Banana call.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.783
Hello?

18:38.325 --> 18:41.286
In the Fairy Tail Garden?
We'll be right there.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.708
There's something in the Fairy Tail Garden
that Kitty Fairy wants us to see.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.127
Let's go check it out.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.254
Great dance party, Catnip.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.215
-Ha-ha! Anytime, kitty cats.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.894
Hello, flower.
Did you get a good drink today?

19:06.728 --> 19:08.147
Wow!

19:08.230 --> 19:09.857
Whoa!

19:10.607 --> 19:13.318
Kitty Fairy, your garden looks beautiful.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.945
Thanks, Gabby.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.781
I love being in my garden after the rain.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.200
We heard
there's something you want us to see?

19:20.284 --> 19:24.371
There sure is.
Just keep your eyes on the sky.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.793
A rainbow!

19:29.877 --> 19:32.087
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

19:32.171 --> 19:35.257
That's the most beautiful rainbow
I've ever seen.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.136
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen,

19:39.219 --> 19:42.139
out of all the beautiful things
I've ever seen.

19:42.222 --> 19:46.059
Rainy days make everything
in the garden more magical.

19:46.143 --> 19:50.314
You know, I think that was
the best rainy day I ever had.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.275
Are you ready for one more surprise?

20:09.082 --> 20:11.293
It's me!

20:12.002 --> 20:13.754
Hi. Cakey here.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.883
There's nothing I love more
than a sprinkle party!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.227
-Yes!

20:57.381 --> 20:58.882
Wait, that one's mine.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.480
Cakey-licious!

22:23.050 --> 22:25.469
Every day's a sprinkle party
with you, Cakey.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.096
Hey!

22:28.180 --> 22:31.600
Look! The sun is shining again
and the rain has stopped.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.686
What do you say, Pandy?
You want to go outside and play?

22:34.770 --> 22:36.188
Uh-huh! You betcha!

22:36.772 --> 22:40.942
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise. Bye!
