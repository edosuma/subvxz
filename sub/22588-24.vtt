Holy paraffin, Batman!
This is going to be a close one.

03:12.763 --> 03:15.029
Too close.

03:15.031 --> 03:18.098
Oh, this is my dream come true.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.732
With you two out of the way

03:19.734 --> 03:22.568
there is nothing
that stands between me

03:22.570 --> 03:25.504
and the lost treasure
of the Inca's.

03:25.506 --> 03:29.641
And it's worth millions.
Millions.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.610
Do you hear me, Batman?

03:32.612 --> 03:36.580
Remember, Riddler, you can't
buy friends with money.

03:36.582 --> 03:39.015
With money who needs friends?

03:40.518 --> 03:42.918
Riddler, honey,
these fumes are terrible.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.653
Can't we go below?

03:44.655 --> 03:48.023
I want to watch this
to its glorious finale.

03:48.025 --> 03:52.394
Can't we watch it just as well
from your candle-scope?

03:52.396 --> 03:53.695
Well, alright.

03:53.697 --> 03:56.564
The fumes are getting
to me too.

03:56.566 --> 03:58.032
Huh!

03:58.034 --> 03:59.733
Keep smiling, you two.

03:59.735 --> 04:03.570
Remember, I'd like
nice expressions on your faces

04:03.572 --> 04:08.041
when we deliver you
to the wax museum.

04:08.675 --> 04:11.943
Bye.
Let's go.

04:12.678 --> 04:14.679
They're going, Batman.
They're going.

04:14.681 --> 04:19.183
Good. Now, to find a way
out of this predicament.

04:21.619 --> 04:24.721
- Wait a minute. What's that?
- Where?

04:24.723 --> 04:25.755
That barrel over there

04:25.757 --> 04:29.425
'with a chemical formula
written on it.'

04:29.427 --> 04:31.660
'I can't see all the formula'

04:31.662 --> 04:33.495
but unless I miss my guess

04:33.497 --> 04:36.664
that's the solution
for treating candle wax.

04:36.666 --> 04:40.100
It's highly explosive
when it's exposed to heat.

04:40.102 --> 04:44.070
I can't see how
that's gonna do us much good.

04:46.973 --> 04:49.908
Matches, down scope.

05:00.986 --> 05:04.521
The candle scope
is working beautifully.

05:04.523 --> 05:06.623
Oh, let me see, let me see.

05:06.625 --> 05:10.593
Alright. Just for a second.

05:11.728 --> 05:16.531
Oh, it does seem a shame.

05:16.533 --> 05:17.231
Moth..

05:17.233 --> 05:21.702
...if you expect to get anywhere
in this arch criminal game

05:21.704 --> 05:23.570
you can't be soft.

05:23.572 --> 05:28.174
You must learn
to control your emotions.

05:35.582 --> 05:38.784
Uh-oh! We're getting
awfully close to that wax.

05:38.786 --> 05:42.087
Those fumes are getting
pretty strong.

05:42.089 --> 05:42.987
Don't give up, Robin.

05:42.989 --> 05:46.724
Remember, where there's
a will there's a way.

05:46.726 --> 05:47.825
If only we could ignite

05:47.827 --> 05:50.594
that barrel of chemical solution
down there

05:50.596 --> 05:53.997
I feel certain
it would blow us free.

05:56.033 --> 06:00.569
I don't know whether it'll work,
but I think it's worth a try.

06:00.571 --> 06:01.636
I can't see what you're doing.

06:01.638 --> 06:04.705
There's a shaft of sunlight
coming through the roof.

06:04.707 --> 06:08.241
If I can just twist around
a little and reflect it

06:08.243 --> 06:11.077
in my highly polished
belt buckle

06:11.079 --> 06:12.211
with a little bit of luck

06:12.213 --> 06:15.948
maybe I can direct it
at the barrel.

06:19.552 --> 06:22.987
What are they doing up there?
Something nearly blinded me.

06:22.989 --> 06:25.756
Let me take a look, boss.

06:28.826 --> 06:32.261
'I don't see nothin' wrong,
boss.'

06:34.864 --> 06:38.867
Somethin' is awfully bright
up there.

06:40.703 --> 06:42.103
Hmm.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.739
I think I've got
the right angle now.

06:45.741 --> 06:49.109
Hold perfectly still.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.014
There. I'm right on the mark.

06:55.016 --> 06:57.850
Prepare yourself for the shock.

06:57.852 --> 07:01.253
What are they doing up there?

07:04.222 --> 07:06.923
Was that an explosion?

07:14.264 --> 07:18.834
Could the explosion have
blown them to bits?

07:35.216 --> 07:36.716
Be still..

07:36.718 --> 07:39.218
...my throbbing heart.

07:39.919 --> 07:43.621
My fondest dreams come true.

07:44.990 --> 07:48.058
Batman and Robin dead.

07:49.727 --> 07:51.260
Dead!

07:52.061 --> 07:54.062
Dead!

07:54.064 --> 07:56.864
My cup runneth over.

07:57.732 --> 07:58.231
Up scope.

07:58.233 --> 08:01.834
Can we forget about them now
and go find that lost treasure?

08:01.836 --> 08:06.038
Oh, let me savor this moment.
So divine.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.274
Seeing Batman and Robin dead

08:09.276 --> 08:13.311
is more important
than any treasure.

08:13.313 --> 08:14.812
More important than all those

08:14.814 --> 08:18.015
Incan baubles, bangles
and beads?

08:18.017 --> 08:19.816
Not to me, it ain't!

08:19.818 --> 08:21.083
Impatience thy name is woman.

08:21.085 --> 08:24.686
First, I must call
Commissioner Gordon

08:24.688 --> 08:26.087
and tell him the good news

08:26.089 --> 08:27.822
about his beloved
caped crusaders

08:27.824 --> 08:31.292
and then confound him
with a little riddle.

08:31.294 --> 08:34.128
Oh, why take time for that?

08:36.131 --> 08:38.832
Crime is no fun without riddles.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.234
I'll have you know
that's the main reason

08:41.236 --> 08:44.270
I took up this crime game.

08:45.772 --> 08:47.005
All of you in the truck.

08:47.007 --> 08:48.906
Ain't you taking
the Batmobile, boss?

08:48.908 --> 08:50.874
Would be too conspicuous
where we're going.

08:50.876 --> 08:54.878
I'll be with you
in a minute. Go on.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.353
Commissioner Gordon here.

09:04.355 --> 09:05.987
This is the Riddler.

09:05.989 --> 09:10.424
I have some news for you
about the late dynamic duo.

09:10.426 --> 09:11.391
Late?

09:11.393 --> 09:12.325
I'm sorry to be the one

09:12.327 --> 09:16.295
to break this unfortunate news
to you, commissioner.

09:16.297 --> 09:19.131
Batman and Robin dead?

09:19.432 --> 09:20.665
I can't believe it.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.900
'If you had anything
to do with this, Riddle'

09:22.902 --> 09:26.403
I'll track you down
to the ends of the earth.

09:26.405 --> 09:29.005
And that's a solemn promise.

09:29.007 --> 09:30.373
While you're at it, commissioner

09:30.375 --> 09:31.273
ponder this riddle.

09:31.275 --> 09:34.342
What has four legs,
runs day and night

09:34.344 --> 09:35.676
but never gets anywhere?

09:35.678 --> 09:37.110
Now, see here,
you cheap scoundrel--

09:37.112 --> 09:42.348
By the time you figure it out
it'll be too late.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.299
Are you alright, Robin?

10:01.301 --> 10:04.101
Gosh! We were almost goners.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.102
Those guys mean business.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.205
It's a miracle we were
blown free by that explosion.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.708
Let's just be thankful that
my calculations were correct.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.743
I don't know how you do it.

10:13.745 --> 10:16.712
There's no time for that now.

10:18.148 --> 10:21.416
Good! They didn't
take the Batmobile.

10:26.221 --> 10:29.523
I think we better call
Commissioner Gordon.

10:30.892 --> 10:32.826
- Commissioner Gordon?
- Who is this?

10:32.828 --> 10:34.861
- Why, this is Batman.
- 'Batman!'

10:34.863 --> 10:38.231
Your caped crusader.
Is something wrong?

10:38.233 --> 10:40.032
The Riddler said you were dead.

10:40.034 --> 10:41.967
Wishful thinking on his part.

10:41.969 --> 10:43.868
We're alive and raring to go.

10:43.870 --> 10:46.537
Well, I must say
this is good news

10:46.539 --> 10:47.437
but back to business.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.173
What do you make
of this clue the Riddler left?

10:50.175 --> 10:53.009
'What has four legs,
runs day and night'

10:53.011 --> 10:54.343
but never gets anywhere?

10:54.345 --> 10:55.877
That's the riddle.
Word for word.

10:55.879 --> 10:58.846
We'll get on it right away,
commissioner.

10:58.848 --> 11:01.181
What has four legs,
runs day and night

11:01.183 --> 11:02.048
but never gets anywhere?

11:02.050 --> 11:03.282
This isn't going
to be easy, Robin.

11:03.284 --> 11:07.219
- A river runs day and night.
- Yes, but it gets somewhere.

11:07.221 --> 11:09.187
It runs to the ocean.

11:09.189 --> 11:11.422
But a fountain.

11:11.424 --> 11:12.423
It could be a fountain.

11:12.425 --> 11:14.925
I think you're
on the right track, Robin.

11:14.927 --> 11:17.394
But that four legs business,
that stumps me.

11:17.396 --> 11:20.497
An animal has four legs.

11:20.499 --> 11:21.564
Wait a minute.

11:21.566 --> 11:23.999
Maybe the fountain
has an animal in it.

11:24.001 --> 11:28.470
The famous lion fountains in
front of the Gotham City Museum?

11:28.472 --> 11:30.171
Gosh, Batman,
I think you're wrong.

11:30.173 --> 11:32.273
The lion fountains
aren't running at all.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.207
The water shortage remember?

11:33.209 --> 11:36.610
That's what that cheating devil
wants us to think, Robin.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.510
I'm sure I'm right.

11:37.512 --> 11:40.079
And that's where
the Riddler must be going

11:40.081 --> 11:42.181
and we must go without delay.

11:42.183 --> 11:44.183
Hold tight.

11:53.892 --> 11:57.494
How could a sarcophagus
be so hard to find?

11:57.496 --> 12:01.598
Gee, boss, I don't even know
what an esophagus looks like.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.566
You numbskull,
you're no help to me here.

12:03.568 --> 12:06.902
You and Matches go upstairs.
Keep a lookout.

12:06.904 --> 12:08.970
Sure, boss.

12:11.139 --> 12:12.205
Oh, Riddler, honey..

12:12.207 --> 12:16.342
...this place gives me
a nice case of the jitters.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.912
What are all those
nasty-looking things?

12:19.914 --> 12:25.617
Ooh. A few little fun things
from the middle ages..

12:25.619 --> 12:29.320
...my little Moth.

12:29.322 --> 12:30.387
That tub there.

12:30.389 --> 12:36.259
That sweet little thing
was called the maiden's bath.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.395
And this..

12:39.397 --> 12:42.598
...the exquisite iron mask.

12:45.101 --> 12:48.703
And this the beloved stocks. Oh.

12:48.705 --> 12:51.706
And that wheel over there..

12:51.708 --> 12:57.511
...that beautiful
ingenious wheel of death.

12:58.646 --> 13:02.949
And last but not least

13:02.951 --> 13:05.251
the rack.

13:08.488 --> 13:15.327
Oh, those were
the good old days.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.162
I'm sorry I asked.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.941
Is it possible
this has some connection

13:32.943 --> 13:34.742
with the lost treasure
of the Inca's?

13:34.744 --> 13:37.144
Aunt Harriet was reading
about it this morning.

13:37.146 --> 13:38.078
It's in all the newspapers.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.414
They can't exhibit it until they
build an airtight display case.

13:41.416 --> 13:44.750
If it's exposed to air,
it will crumble to dust.

13:44.752 --> 13:46.051
It's beginning to make sense.

13:46.053 --> 13:47.819
The lost treasure
of the Inca's

13:47.821 --> 13:50.121
must be hidden
inside that sarcophagus.

13:50.123 --> 13:50.988
I'd stake my life on it.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.724
So that's what he learned
from that old book.

13:53.726 --> 13:56.560
- I hope we're not too late.
- So do I, Robin.

13:56.562 --> 13:58.094
The Riddler and his gang
may be destroying

13:58.096 --> 14:00.496
one of the world's greatest
archeological treasures

14:00.498 --> 14:04.766
and for a mere million dollars
worth of jewels.

14:06.902 --> 14:10.170
It's locked.
They must be closed today.

14:10.172 --> 14:12.972
How do we get in?

14:14.474 --> 14:16.775
Batman, look, that window.

14:16.777 --> 14:20.645
It's open, but it's too small.
I'd never make it.

14:20.647 --> 14:24.649
But I could.
I could, Batman.

14:24.651 --> 14:25.883
- It's dangerous.
- Let me do it.

14:25.885 --> 14:29.119
I promise I'll come right down
and open the door for you.

14:29.121 --> 14:31.821
- Please, Batman.
- Be careful, Robin.

14:31.823 --> 14:34.590
Don't try to capture the Riddler
and the gang by yourself.

14:34.592 --> 14:37.726
Come immediately downstairs
and open the door for me.

14:37.728 --> 14:39.094
I'll handle it.
Do you understand?

14:39.096 --> 14:42.030
- Roger.
- Take your Bat-communicator.

14:42.032 --> 14:44.799
And keep in touch.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.133
Stand clear.

14:50.570 --> 14:52.170
Grab it.

14:59.511 --> 15:03.680
'Keep in touch with me
on your throat communicator.'

15:04.548 --> 15:07.650
Golly, Batman,
I hope we're not too late.

15:07.652 --> 15:08.584
I join you in that hope.

15:08.586 --> 15:11.687
I shudder to think how it might
effect our foreign relations

15:11.689 --> 15:13.722
if anything happened
to this exhibit.

15:13.724 --> 15:14.589
How do you mean, Batman?

15:14.591 --> 15:17.658
Can you imagine the reaction of
our good neighbors to the south

15:17.660 --> 15:21.128
should we allow their national
treasure to be destroyed?

15:21.130 --> 15:24.464
Gosh! I see what you mean.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.970
Take care, Robin.

15:39.112 --> 15:44.149
- You! I thought you were dead.
- I'll show you how dead I am.

15:45.784 --> 15:46.483
Ow!

15:46.485 --> 15:49.853
Hey, Matches, give me a hand.
I..

15:52.022 --> 15:53.689
Ow!

15:54.524 --> 15:57.726
Now, you're making me mad, kid.

16:15.579 --> 16:17.279
Robin?

16:17.480 --> 16:18.980
Robin!

16:18.982 --> 16:21.215
Do you hear me?

16:21.217 --> 16:24.551
Is something wrong, Robin?

16:24.553 --> 16:25.518
Robin!

16:25.520 --> 16:28.854
Come in, Robin.

16:32.224 --> 16:36.460
- Hey, boss, look what we found.
- Huh?

16:39.464 --> 16:44.301
- But you're dead.
- No thanks to you that I'm not.

16:45.536 --> 16:48.437
And Batman...he lives too?

16:48.439 --> 16:52.574
No, you fiend, you've destroyed
the finest man that ever lived.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.576
And I'll get you for it.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.311
You pernicious pipsqueak.

16:56.313 --> 16:59.047
You're in no position
to threaten anyone.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.516
Put him on the rack.

17:05.220 --> 17:09.823
If he doesn't fit,
stretch him to size!

17:09.825 --> 17:12.559
But don't hurt him.

17:15.095 --> 17:18.196
Robin, if you can hear me

17:18.199 --> 17:21.066
I'm coming in after you.

17:40.751 --> 17:44.053
Commissioner,
I'm at the Gotham City Museum.

17:44.055 --> 17:47.456
Robin's inside
and I'm going in after him.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.891
You'd better send some men over.

17:49.893 --> 17:51.726
Right.

18:04.138 --> 18:08.841
You may think you have
the upper hand now, but wait.

18:09.742 --> 18:11.976
Hey, boss, I think I found it.

18:11.978 --> 18:14.845
What? The sar...cophagus?

18:14.847 --> 18:17.681
- Yeah, it's over here.
- The sarcophagus!

18:21.985 --> 18:24.186
Just think, think.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.121
In a few short moments

18:26.123 --> 18:30.859
the vast treasure of the Incans
shall be mine, mine!

18:30.861 --> 18:33.728
Ours, honey, ours.

18:33.730 --> 18:36.464
Who said you can't take it
with you?

18:36.466 --> 18:39.900
Lucky for me
the Incan emperor's dead.

18:39.902 --> 18:42.168
At least their jewels.

18:49.876 --> 18:52.544
Ooh, the sarcophagus!

18:56.848 --> 18:59.916
Oh, it's too bad Batman's dead.

18:59.918 --> 19:03.552
If only he could see me now.

19:05.688 --> 19:08.189
Ahh!

19:08.191 --> 19:10.558
Again it's Batman!

19:10.560 --> 19:15.062
It can't be.
I saw you dead with my own eyes.

19:15.064 --> 19:18.031
You lied to me, Boy Wonder.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.534
A little white lie is excusable

19:21.536 --> 19:24.837
when dealing
with the likes of you

19:24.839 --> 19:26.939
you black-hearted scoundrel.

19:26.941 --> 19:31.743
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him, men!

20:14.653 --> 20:18.589
This is gonna hurt me
more than it does you.

20:24.762 --> 20:27.997
Get him, Matches!
Get him!

20:32.969 --> 20:35.003
I don't know about you,
Riddler, honey

20:35.005 --> 20:37.071
but I'm gettin' out of here.

20:37.073 --> 20:39.039
Ooh!

20:39.041 --> 20:41.207
Alright, Riddler.

20:41.209 --> 20:43.242
Now, it's your turn.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.544
No, no. No.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.549
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- 'Batman.'

20:51.551 --> 20:52.049
'Batman.'

20:52.051 --> 20:54.885
Holy smoke! The candle is still
burning under the wax.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.120
Put it out before
it eats through.

20:57.122 --> 21:00.123
Good thinking, Robin.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.325
Just in time.

21:04.761 --> 21:07.396
Watch out, Batman!

21:21.978 --> 21:22.811
Oh! Ah!

21:22.813 --> 21:26.347
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with knives?

21:26.349 --> 21:29.183
Can we talk this over, Batman?

21:29.185 --> 21:30.284
Ah! Ooh!

21:30.286 --> 21:32.986
Let me give you one
last word of advice.

21:32.988 --> 21:34.020
Give up your evil ways.

21:34.022 --> 21:36.288
When you've paid
your debt to society

21:36.290 --> 21:37.689
and pay it you will

21:37.691 --> 21:40.191
start life anew
as a respected citizen.

21:40.193 --> 21:42.826
I'll give you anything,
anything you want.

21:42.828 --> 21:45.128
Just name it, Batman.
Name it.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.395
Ahh! Ooh!

21:46.397 --> 21:47.462
Oh! Aww!

21:47.464 --> 21:50.965
Batman, that smarts.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.067
Ooh.

21:57.705 --> 21:59.038
Robin, are you alright?

21:59.040 --> 22:01.106
I'm just a little sore,
Batman, that's all.

22:01.108 --> 22:03.708
Well, one of Aunt Harriet's
good, nourishing meals

22:03.710 --> 22:04.709
will set everything right again.

22:04.711 --> 22:08.012
I sure worked up an appetite,
I'll tell you that.

22:08.014 --> 22:11.715
You're all under arrest.
Now, no monkey business.

22:11.717 --> 22:14.250
We got you covered.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.818
There's no need for guns,
Chief O'Hara.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.753
There's no more fight
left in them

22:18.755 --> 22:21.922
When Commissioner Gordon
told me to go to the museum

22:21.924 --> 22:24.224
naturally, I thought
he meant the wax museum.

22:24.226 --> 22:26.059
O-otherwise, we would've
been here sooner.

22:26.061 --> 22:28.394
Anyone can make
that mistake, Chief O'Hara.

22:28.396 --> 22:29.728
There's no harm done, chief.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.129
The Riddler and his accomplices

22:31.131 --> 22:35.366
are ready to be delivered
into your capable hands.

22:36.401 --> 22:38.802
Oh, Batman, honey,
Moth's learned her lesson.

22:38.804 --> 22:40.503
Really she has.
Crime doesn't pay.

22:40.505 --> 22:44.173
Unfortunately, you learned
your lesson too late, Moth.

22:44.175 --> 22:48.810
A moth that plays around candles
is bound to be burned.

22:48.812 --> 22:51.145
Oh. Oh!

22:54.516 --> 22:57.851
Oh, Batman.

22:57.853 --> 23:00.887
You may have won the battle..

23:00.889 --> 23:03.890
but the war isn't over yet.

23:13.301 --> 23:16.670
This is certainly
a very educational way

23:16.672 --> 23:17.570
to spend an afternoon.

23:17.572 --> 23:20.506
Yes, and it's going to come
in so handy at school.

23:20.508 --> 23:23.709
I think I'll do
my end-of-term report on it.

23:23.711 --> 23:24.509
Very good.

23:24.511 --> 23:25.676
Most Americans don't realize

23:25.678 --> 23:27.411
what we owe
to the ancient Incans.

23:27.413 --> 23:30.814
Very few appreciate that they
gave us the white potato

23:30.816 --> 23:33.116
and many varieties
of Indian corn.

23:33.118 --> 23:34.550
Now, whenever
I eat mashed potatoes

23:34.552 --> 23:37.386
I, for one,
will think of the Incans.

23:37.388 --> 23:38.553
Mercy alive!

23:38.555 --> 23:41.756
Have you ever seen
such beautiful jewels?

23:41.758 --> 23:44.692
They must've cost
a king's ransom.

23:44.694 --> 23:46.860
It says here
that they found the jewels

23:46.862 --> 23:49.262
in a secret panel
in the sarcophagus.

23:49.264 --> 23:51.464
They were hidden to guard
against grave robbers

23:51.466 --> 23:52.731
who were very prevalent
in olden days.

23:52.733 --> 23:56.301
Well, thank goodness we don't
have anything like that

23:56.303 --> 23:57.702
to worry about today.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.770
Well, I think we
should be leaving now.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.339
Oh, Bruce, I want
just one more peak

24:02.341 --> 24:05.875
at this old Incan emperor.

24:05.877 --> 24:06.775
Will you look at that?

24:06.777 --> 24:12.748
Isn't he preserved nicely for
all those thousands of years.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.684
It's remarkable.

24:15.686 --> 24:18.920
The old boy nearly
didn't make it.

24:23.558 --> 24:28.528
