18:14.259 --> 18:17.663
{\an8}but what I really need
is for him to understand me.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.032
We're supposed to be partners

18:20.098 --> 18:22.301
and by not putting me
on the track,

18:22.367 --> 18:25.571
I really feel like
he was dismissing me

18:25.637 --> 18:28.907
and not helping me
to my dreams in music.

18:28.974 --> 18:33.946
I want to apologize to
you for making you feel

18:34.012 --> 18:38.584
{\an4}that I don't support you
because that wasn't
my intentions

18:38.650 --> 18:41.286
{\an5}and that's not how I
feel and that's not
what's in my heart.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.822
I didn't consciously
try to be in your way

18:43.889 --> 18:46.458
{\an1}or prevent you or keep you
away from your dreams.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.962
{\an1}What I wanted for you
was to establish something

18:50.028 --> 18:53.131
that I felt was more
of a real foundation.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.434
But do you notice
that that's my passion?

18:55.501 --> 18:59.638
{\an5}I believe that you was
passionate at a point
and at another point,

18:59.705 --> 19:03.275
{\an1}you... like, those lines
got blurry, right?

19:03.342 --> 19:05.511
Music is a passion of mine.

19:05.577 --> 19:08.347
It is creatively
what's inside of me.

19:08.413 --> 19:12.417
{\an5}I went to school
for performing arts.
I did tap, jazz, ballet.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.119
Like, something happened
to me tragically

19:14.186 --> 19:16.188
and I don't know if you
want to be there for me

19:16.255 --> 19:21.159
{\an5}to help me get back
my security to be
an artist.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.595
You want me to show you
my passion

19:23.662 --> 19:26.965
and that I could hard
for music,

19:27.032 --> 19:28.700
but I need your help.
I need a team.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.403
{\an5}I need more than
just myself at this
point in time.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.307
I've had myself
only for 20 years.

19:35.374 --> 19:38.377
You know, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

19:38.443 --> 19:43.115
{\an1}And as far as the shooting,
um, for a long time,

19:43.181 --> 19:45.450
{\an1}I felt like...
and I still do...

19:45.517 --> 19:50.022
I felt like it's my fault,
but then, on the flip side,

19:50.088 --> 19:53.792
{\an1}I'm like, something good
happened out of it.

19:53.859 --> 19:59.364
{\an1}I do feel like we got
heaven out of hell.

19:59.431 --> 20:03.635
{\an5}(Maino)
The shooting was crazy,
and Maggie still suffers
some issues to this day.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.773
{\an5}Ain't no denying it, though.
That night pulled us
closer together.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.808
That's why we got the bond
that we have now.

20:09.875 --> 20:16.181
But I also feel like I've
inherited this persona of,

20:16.248 --> 20:18.083
{\an1}you know, it could be worse,
it could be worse,

20:18.150 --> 20:21.219
{\an5}and I'm not dealing with
things how I should.
I'm not coping with it.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.056
{\an5}I have to walk around
with this rod in my leg
the rest of my life

20:24.122 --> 20:26.892
{\an5}and I have to have
this bullet in the
rest of my life.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.128
When you almost lost your life
like I have

20:30.195 --> 20:33.699
or got your freedom taken away
like Maino has,

20:33.765 --> 20:36.702
you start to process things
differently.

20:36.768 --> 20:40.906
{\an5}Fear can cripple
your whole life and it's
hard to overcome.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.741
That's no way to live.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.176
You know, I've been
in places in my life

20:44.242 --> 20:47.279
where it made me feel
like I couldn't love,

20:47.346 --> 20:51.850
{\an1}and it made me feel
numb to certain things.

20:51.917 --> 20:56.054
{\an4}You know, um, being
in this relationship
opened me up

20:56.121 --> 21:01.960
{\an1}and it's teaching me
how to be not as selfish.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.763
{\an4}I don't think
I'm doing a good job
at encouraging you

21:04.830 --> 21:07.899
{\an4}because I'm so caught up
in my own world, caught
up in my own struggle,

21:07.966 --> 21:12.771
{\an4}but never believe
for one second that
I don't have your back,

21:12.838 --> 21:15.674
because that's not true,
and sometimes, I come off

21:15.741 --> 21:22.114
{\an4}like a (bleep) sometimes,
hard, but I'm telling you
what's in my heart.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.182
{\an1}I'm telling you
I'm riding with you.

21:24.249 --> 21:29.354
{\an5}Why you crying?

21:24.249 --> 21:29.354
Because it's a lot.

21:29.421 --> 21:33.959
Both Maino and I have tough
shells and it touches me

21:34.026 --> 21:38.563
{\an5}to see him soften up
and acknowledge the fact
that he did hurt me,

21:38.630 --> 21:40.932
and I'm ready to put
this music issue behind us.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.001
I brought you out here to
the middle of the ocean.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.170
Are we all right?

21:43.068 --> 21:45.170

30:57.222 --> 31:04.262
{\an5}I just lost my friend,

31:18.042 --> 31:21.312
A few months ago,
I lost a real friend

{\an5}and if him and I aren't friends

then I need to know that,

a friendship than
I think it is.

{\an4}No, you're not...
You're not wrong.
You're right.

little pits in my life

31:45.403 --> 31:49.741
{\an4}where sometimes I, like,
shut down and just
don't talk to nobody.

31:49.807 --> 31:54.579
{\an4}Sometimes I feel like me
acting the way I do
when I'm in crowds,

31:54.646 --> 31:59.250
{\an4}it's almost like a defense
mechanism or just something
that's weird that I do

31:59.317 --> 32:01.786
{\an5}because the stuff that
I've gone through,
especially this year,

32:01.853 --> 32:05.623
{\an4}just as far as just
everything, with just
dealing with the public,

32:05.690 --> 32:08.526
{\an4}it's probably like
the highest that
I've ever been

32:08.593 --> 32:12.397

32:12.463 --> 32:16.000
{\an4}like, you... you...
I'm human, you know
what I'm saying? And...

32:12.463 --> 32:16.000
{\an3}Shut out.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.703

32:35.086 --> 32:36.721

32:36.788 --> 32:40.091
{\an6}Right.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.091
{\an4}And I go to the
Jacuzzi and there's
other people there.

32:40.158 --> 32:43.428
{\an5}So, he tells me all
the time, yo, you get
too close to people.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.762

you're too cliquey.

the (bleep) Jacuzzi

33:02.513 --> 33:04.182

37:16.200 --> 37:20.671
{\an5}so I can know how to move
and dictate my household
in the appropriate manner.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.773
What we talking about,
though?

37:22.840 --> 37:25.876
Erica's here.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.876
{\an1}Oh!

37:25.943 --> 37:27.979
I called Safaree
before this trip.

37:28.045 --> 37:31.816
{\an5}I asked him if he was
bringing Erica Mena.
He said no.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.418
Maino asked him, he said no.

37:34.485 --> 37:39.590
{\an5}So you can imagine our
surprise when all of us
picked up our phone

37:39.657 --> 37:45.696
{\an5}and saw none other than
Erica Mena hanging out
and tanning at our resort.

37:45.763 --> 37:49.667
{\an4}I guess my new question is,
why don't you feel like
you owe us an apology?

37:49.734 --> 37:54.071
{\an5}Well, when we had
that convo, that
wasn't the scenario,

37:54.138 --> 37:56.807
I mean,
bringing my girl here.

37:56.874 --> 37:59.877
{\an1}When the situation changed,
you got my number.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.880
{\an1}That was a simple
(bleep) text.

38:02.947 --> 38:07.752
{\an4}If you care about
the relationship,
you not a stranger to me.

38:07.818 --> 38:11.222
{\an4}We talk.
I been to your home.
You have been to mine.

38:11.288 --> 38:13.324
{\an5}You held my child.

38:11.288 --> 38:13.324
You-- You put-- Yeah.

38:13.391 --> 38:17.461
{\an5}I don't take these
types of things lightly
at all, my (bleep),

38:17.528 --> 38:18.863
{\an1}if I'm gonna keep here,
being with you,

38:18.929 --> 38:21.332
{\an1}so I'm trying to
address it this way.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.068
Any other (bleep), I swear to
God, this would go different.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.569
{\an1}This would go
a different way.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.305
{\an1}So when you running around
with home girl,

38:28.372 --> 38:30.741
{\an1}have a (bleep) blast,
my (bleep),

38:30.808 --> 38:34.812
{\an4}but when it's in
that close proximity
of my family,

38:34.879 --> 38:38.449
{\an1}it's a security breach!
I don't play family games!

38:38.516 --> 38:41.085
You know, last time I checked,
I don't need permission

38:41.152 --> 38:45.489
from anyone to go anywhere,
to bring anyone anywhere.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.258
I don't need permission
for anything.

38:47.324 --> 38:50.461
{\an5}It's my business.
Ain't nobody seeing her.
Any of y'all seen her?

38:50.528 --> 38:53.064
{\an1}I'm not asking what the
(bleep) you think about it!

38:53.130 --> 38:54.799
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about your views!

38:54.865 --> 38:57.535
{\an1}Clearly,
your ideology is off!

38:57.601 --> 39:00.337
{\an1}I'm not asking you something,
I'm telling you!

39:00.404 --> 39:02.940
When you (bleep)
with my (bleep),

39:03.007 --> 39:05.376
{\an1}you gonna respect my
(bleep) word, my (bleep).

39:05.443 --> 39:08.312
This is the reason why
I fell in love with Joe.

39:08.379 --> 39:12.116
He's passionate,
he's strong, he's vocal.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.285
And then, you know, sometimes,
I hate that too.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.887
But for right now,
I love it.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.255
That's nobody's business.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.024
Fam, if I'm putting
(bleep) Nicki Minaj,

39:20.091 --> 39:21.592
and I fly her out here,

39:21.659 --> 39:23.994
{\an4}(bleep),
that's your business!

39:21.659 --> 39:23.994
It is what it is.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.297
{\an5}'Cause now, the way
you coming, clapping,
all that cursing (bleep),

39:26.363 --> 39:29.667
my (bleep), I wouldn't
come at you like that.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.969
{\an5}If you keep talking,
my (bleep), it's gonna
go a different way!

39:32.036 --> 39:34.004
You hear me, my (bleep)?
I'm not playing with you!

39:34.071 --> 39:38.075
{\an5}Baby, that's enough.

39:34.071 --> 39:38.075
{\an1}(bleep)! No, this (bleep)
held my kid!

39:38.142 --> 39:41.645
{\an4}I'll put this (bleep)'s
face in the sand!
Don't play with me!

39:48.319 --> 39:49.820

Next time on the season finale
of "Love &amp; Hip Hop"...

39:49.887 --> 39:52.256
{\an8}I need to take ownership.

39:52.323 --> 39:57.194
{\an7}I've been operating
from a place of fear
and not love.

39:57.261 --> 39:58.429
{\an8}Cynthia...

39:58.496 --> 40:03.167
{\an8}(all cheering)

40:03.234 --> 40:05.402
{\an8}(Papoose)
This is the golden child.

40:08.239 --> 40:12.910
{\an8}(Juelz)
As much as I was praying
for no jail time,

40:12.977 --> 40:14.912
{\an8}it is, like, a relief.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.748
{\an7}The hardest thing for me
is gonna be you and the kids.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.656
{\an7}Safaree admitted in his post
he overplayed, didn't he?

40:25.723 --> 40:28.058
{\an7}How many times I asked you
if you was (bleep)?

40:28.125 --> 40:30.161
{\an8}You didn't ask me that.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.161
{\an8}Yes, I did.

40:30.227 --> 40:31.462
{\an8}Yes, I did.

40:30.227 --> 40:31.462
{\an8}No, you didn't.

40:31.529 --> 40:32.963
{\an8}You know what?
(bleep)!
