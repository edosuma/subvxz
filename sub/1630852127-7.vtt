00:14.760 --> 00:19.040
Oh, you're up already!
Happy birthday!

00:19.080 --> 00:20.120
Thanks.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.280
What's wrong with you?

00:25.320 --> 00:27.120
Oh, I thought you would've seen it.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.680
It's just something little.
You can open it whenever.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
Thank you.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
Oh...
Sorry.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.000
Yeah, no, of course.
It's the big day.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.400
OK, um, I will be back
early afternoon

00:41.440 --> 00:43.560
and then we can get cracking
on that dinner of yours.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.360
Is Grandma coming?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.320
Do you want her to?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.480
Then she's coming.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.240
OK, I...uh, I really have to go.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.320
Well, have a great day.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.040

are too much?

01:22.120 --> 01:24.280
For an 18th?

01:24.320 --> 01:27.720
Yeah. Not the crappy ones.
The helium ones.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.120
Uh...
Unless they're full of alcohol.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.600
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, that's a terrible idea.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.280
Righto.
(LAUGHS)

01:36.320 --> 01:38.160
Killjoy.
It's exciting, though, huh?

01:38.200 --> 01:41.120
Little family affair for you. Huh?
Yeah.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.160
Mmm.
You too.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.320
What do you mean?
You, Laney, your sperm...

01:46.360 --> 01:49.280
What... No. No, no, no.
No, no, no, that was, um...

01:49.320 --> 01:50.600
That's purely hypothetical.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.240
That was just two friends...
shooting shit over a dinner.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.920
Alright. Does she know about that,
'Sperminator'?

01:55.960 --> 01:59.400
Yeah, I think... Sperminator?
Don't. Yuck.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.720
And I definitely didn't say yes.
There was no... I definitely didn't.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.640
There was no verbal confirmation.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.560
Did she say there was
verbal confirmation?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.120
OK. Celina. So, it's a first baby.
Uncomplicated pregnancy.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.720
The only thing we kind of need to
keep an eye on...is her family.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.040
I've handled many a family
in my time, Grace Cresswell.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.280
I got you covered.
OK. We'll see.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.480
Yiayia.
Good. You are here, eh?

02:27.520 --> 02:30.000
We're here.
And who is this?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.920
This is Max. Max, this is
Celina's grandmother. Yiayia.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.640
Oh, please, please.
Help yourself to food.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.280
There's moussaka, there's salads,
whatever you want.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.800
Yiayia, you don't mess around.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.520
Of course not.
Hey, George.

Hey, Grace.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.640
You made it.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.440
Is this more food?
Oh, this is nothing.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.760
Nothing?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.080

Hey. Good.

how about we find a quiet room

with me. I'm not five.

it's been easier without him.

Um, it's totally fine.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.480
How can I help?

05:45.520 --> 05:46.840
It might be a bit late

05:46.880 --> 05:49.960
but I've kind of fallen in love
with the idea of a natural birth.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.560
I wanted to see if I can transfer
to the Birthing Centre.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.560
Yeah, absolutely.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.080
I mean, we'll have to get
your medical files

06:00.560 --> 06:02.040

I mean, you didn't have to come
all the way down here for that.

I'll just make some calls,
set you up with a midwife.

I'm sure Grace is available.
I'd prefer you.

in the room that I trust.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.800
# All we talk about is leaving

36:54.840 --> 37:00.840
# All that I know is
No matter how far away

37:00.880 --> 37:03.520
# This is the place we were made

37:03.560 --> 37:08.880
# I know every streetlight
And maybe the colours will fade

37:08.920 --> 37:11.360
# This is the place we were made

37:11.400 --> 37:14.760
# By the late nights
and fires on the beach

37:14.800 --> 37:16.760
# Made by... #
Laney.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.760
# The small-town secrets we'd keep

37:18.800 --> 37:23.320
# All that I know is
No matter how far away... #

37:23.360 --> 37:24.800
She's perfect.

37:24.840 --> 37:29.520
# This is the place we were made. #

37:34.400 --> 37:37.880
(LOW-LEVEL CONVERSATION)

37:37.920 --> 37:39.680
Heard you had a visitor
in the overnight room.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.640
I see you ignored everything I said.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.160
I chose not to listen.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.440
Good outcome, nonetheless.
Surprise, surprise.

37:45.480 --> 37:49.000
Sash, I'm sorry. You've just never
done something like that before.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.360
Yeah, well, this is
the new and improved Sasha...

37:53.520 --> 37:55.240
that speaks in third person.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.880
You saw me breaking the rules.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.240
I saw us giving a single mother
some TLC

38:01.280 --> 38:03.160
before she pushed
her third baby out.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.080
If we can help, we do it.

38:05.120 --> 38:09.760
OK. I hear you and I'm sorry.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.000
Thank you.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.320
Also, I'm banning myself
from the Birthing Centre.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.600
(LAUGHS) What?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.320
You guys do things differently here

38:20.360 --> 38:24.040
and you're definitely going to ask me
to do something I don't want to do

38:24.080 --> 38:26.760
and I'm probably going to do it
because...

38:26.800 --> 38:28.760
I'm in love with you.

38:32.120 --> 38:37.000
So, I'm going to leave before you
ask me to do some other crazy thing.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.320
But I'll see you tonight?

38:39.560 --> 38:42.040
Sasha says that you will.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.640
(LAUGHS)

38:54.440 --> 38:57.120
DIANE: Oh! This is a nice surprise.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.120
What time did she call you?
About 11:00.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.560
Why didn't you call me sooner?
Grace, she's 18.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.200
She got shitfaced. It happens.

39:03.240 --> 39:06.600
Look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.720
I wanted it to be perfect
for everyone and I so blew it...

39:09.760 --> 39:11.920
Mum, it's fine. Just... Is she OK?

39:11.960 --> 39:15.720
She... She's missing her mother.
You may have contributed.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.240
I didn't even think.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.040
I just was so focused
on making her day special.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.960
Oh, well, that's motherhood.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.480
Sometimes things
blow up in your face

39:25.520 --> 39:27.200
despite your best intentions.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.040
And she asked about her father again
this morning.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.560
Well, I told her the truth.
What else can I say?

39:40.640 --> 39:41.680
What's going on?

39:42.920 --> 39:46.360
You may not have told her
the whole...truth.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.040
Sorry?

39:49.680 --> 39:52.040
It was never gonna be the right time
to tell you this.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.400
In my defence,
it was a very brief conversation.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.880
I certainly wasn't expecting him
to disappear.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.680
What are you talking about?

40:00.720 --> 40:06.880
I had a word to Rohan about you
before he left.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.920
What?

40:08.960 --> 40:11.680
You were wagging school,
you were dropping classes...

40:11.720 --> 40:12.720
Mum...

40:12.760 --> 40:14.840
You were going down
a very weird road with that boy...

40:14.880 --> 40:16.080
What did you do?
..and I...

40:17.760 --> 40:21.760
I simply told him that if he really
cared about you, he would...

40:21.800 --> 40:23.440
back off a bit, that's all.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.280
Just let you focus, you know.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.720
I had no idea you were pregnant.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.120
(GASPS)

40:37.560 --> 40:41.680
So, this whole time,
I've hated him...

40:43.360 --> 40:46.520
I felt that I had no other choice
but to give up my daughter...

40:46.560 --> 40:48.840
He still left you, Grace...
Because of you!

40:51.480 --> 40:52.840
Grace...
Just...

40:55.400 --> 40:57.400
Just...don't!

41:25.240 --> 41:26.880
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

41:27.960 --> 41:29.640
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.960
Some stuff came up.
Are you good to go?

41:35.520 --> 41:36.720
I'm not coming.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.440
Sorry?

41:40.320 --> 41:41.600
(EXHALES)

41:41.640 --> 41:44.000
I never should've found you.

41:44.040 --> 41:49.800
After my mum died, I thought,
you know, if I met you,

41:49.840 --> 41:51.360
maybe I'd feel better.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.480
But I don't.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.640
I just want my mum

41:59.680 --> 42:01.960
and you acting like her, it...

42:04.680 --> 42:06.800
So, I'm staying with Diane...

42:08.000 --> 42:09.880
until the adoption's over.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.400
Here?

42:13.760 --> 42:15.120
Yeah.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.640
Dad will pick up my stuff.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.680
Sorry.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.480
Oh... That's fine.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.240
Whatever you need.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.160
I'm sorry that it's been
so confusing.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.360
But if you want to stay here, then...

42:45.520 --> 42:47.840
And if you change your mind...
I won't.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.480
..well, you know where to find me.

43:02.920 --> 43:07.960
I'm sorry for just...showing up
at the Birthing Centre that day.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.640
I shouldn't have done that.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.440
Don't apologise.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.360
It was the best day of my life.

43:26.880 --> 43:27.880
