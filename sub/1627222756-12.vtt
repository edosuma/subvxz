And all of those are
meant to be hints

49:22.281 --> 49:25.545
at the things that bother Maggie
about the system,

49:25.589 --> 49:27.069
because she just doesn't
agree with it.

49:27.112 --> 49:28.592
[Walker growling]

49:28.635 --> 49:30.463
[Stabbing]

49:30.507 --> 49:32.030
Fire!

49:32.074 --> 49:34.728
[Gunshots]

49:34.772 --> 49:38.515
She's looking at this military
and just realizing, like,

49:38.558 --> 49:43.302
"Wow, they just mowed down
a whole lot of Walkers,"

49:43.346 --> 49:47.959
and that bothers her,
because she knows that

49:48.003 --> 49:51.310
if they ever came to a point
of disagreement,

49:51.354 --> 49:55.575
what's to stop them from
just mowing them down, too?

49:55.619 --> 49:58.317
And so I think, for Maggie,
it's a matter of principle.

49:58.361 --> 50:01.059
The Hilltop's gonna
pass on your offer.

50:01.103 --> 50:03.801
Could I ask why?

50:03.844 --> 50:05.672
'Cause like you said,

50:05.716 --> 50:07.500
everything
costs something.

50:07.544 --> 50:10.373
That's one of tougher decisions
that she makes,

50:10.416 --> 50:14.159
because her community
is really in dire straits,

50:14.203 --> 50:17.554
and by virtue of the fact that
she makes a different decision

50:17.597 --> 50:20.905
than Alexandria made,
she loses some of her people.

50:20.948 --> 50:22.298
I'm leaving,
Maggie.

50:22.341 --> 50:24.996
Some of the others
are coming with me,

50:25.040 --> 50:26.258
and you should, too.

50:26.302 --> 50:28.086
There's a cost
to Maggie's decision.

50:28.130 --> 50:29.783
For us,
when we're writing the show,

50:29.827 --> 50:33.483
we're always trying to look at,
when somebody chooses something,

50:33.526 --> 50:35.920
what are they saying "yes" to?

50:35.963 --> 50:37.965
'Cause it's very rare in life

50:38.009 --> 50:40.968
that you say "yes" to something
or choose something

50:41.012 --> 50:43.362
and that there isn't
a potential downside.

50:43.406 --> 50:46.322
You know, it's going to be even
harder for her and her child,

50:46.365 --> 50:49.803
and she knows that's not
an easy decision,

50:49.847 --> 50:52.197
but she feels like it's
the right decision for her.

50:52.241 --> 50:54.199
Get ready, Aaron.

50:54.243 --> 50:56.506
We're going to
remake the world.
