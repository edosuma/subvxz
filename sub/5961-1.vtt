00:51.218 --> 00:54.949
- I never heard of him.
- Who?

00:55.122 --> 00:56.521
The man you recommended.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.056
The guitar fighter?

00:59.226 --> 01:04.186
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

01:04.364 --> 01:07.926
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.228
You should meet him.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.970
Me. Me. That's me.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.138
As long as I'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.010
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.084
No.

01:25.252 --> 01:29.586
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.885
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

01:33.060 --> 01:37.827
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.728
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

01:40.935 --> 01:45.235
But Marquez, that's a different story.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.271
<i>Marquez.</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:51.309
<i>Marquez.</i>
<i>Gen. Marquez.</i>

01:53.013 --> 01:55.675
<i>Powerful, dangerous.</i>

01:55.850 --> 01:59.877
<i>Marquez, he really had it in</i>
<i>for this Mariachi, see.</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:13.260
<i>They called him "Mariachi"</i>
<i>because he used to carry this guitar.</i>

02:14.034 --> 02:15.865
A guitar?

02:16.070 --> 02:18.937
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.933
Look, this story is well-traveled.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.104
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.207
Just read between the lines.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.372
<i>Now, he may not have been</i>
<i>the biggest Mexican ever...</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:35.413
- All right.
...but she was as deadly...

03:35.583 --> 03:36.880
...as she was beautiful.

03:37.051 --> 03:41.750
- There's a girl?
- Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.380
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

03:47.161 --> 03:51.120
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.503
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

04:38.679 --> 04:43.514
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

04:43.684 --> 04:48.451
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

04:50.491 --> 04:53.392
...put a bullet in his heart.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.531
Only he didn't die.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.536
- I don't know what happened after that.
- Would you like some?

05:06.707 --> 05:10.643
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.837
But like I said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.746
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.783
Well...

05:23.023 --> 05:24.581
...that is truly unbelievable.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.886
Well, I'm not big on telling stories.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.496
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.656
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

05:33.834 --> 05:37.099
...for $ 10,000 in cash.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.643
It'll do.

05:44.812 --> 05:49.112
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.309
- Why'd you say no?
- I'm not a greedy man.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.784
Not looking to get rich quick.

05:54.955 --> 05:59.983
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.187
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

06:05.566 --> 06:07.295
But 10?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.129
Ten thousand is civilized.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.737
Ten is something
we both can live with.

06:16.343 --> 06:19.005
Ten might still be too much.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.941
You'd kill me over $ 10,000?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.017
You wouldn't dare.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.853
You wouldn't dare.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.819
Yes, I would.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.564
Would you do me the honor?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.572
You need to learn to play.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.408
That's why you're here.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.672
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.670
We only make guitars here.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.919
Mariachi.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.846
Which one?

11:02.796 --> 11:05.264
I don't know who you mean.

12:06.693 --> 12:10.686
I'm honored to be in your presence.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.329
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.141
Keep it. He made that for you.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.936
You know, if I was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.199
Go back to where I came from...

12:55.408 --> 12:59.606
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.642
You speak English?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.311
I didn't think so.

13:07.187 --> 13:11.123
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.822
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

13:18.365 --> 13:21.664
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.049
I present to you Señor Blascoe.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.738
Please sit.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.581
We hear you want to work for us.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.752
I too am ready to start a new life.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.395
This is your lucky day.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.036
Did you order my <i>pibil</i> ?

14:39.312 --> 14:42.247
- Does it have a name?
- They call him "EI."

14:42.716 --> 14:44.616
As in "The."

14:44.784 --> 14:47.844
I know what it means. Thank you.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.714
Alert the Barillo cartel...

14:50.891 --> 14:55.055
...that El has come out of hiding.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.095
- I don't think we should...
- Are you a Mexican...

14:58.265 --> 15:00.699
...or a Mexi-can't?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.195
I'm a Mexican.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.168
Good.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.275
Then do as I say.

15:18.084 --> 15:22.418
- Nice tune.
- Something my brother taught me.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.181
I killed him.

15:25.358 --> 15:29.294
Yes, I was privy to that
information already. How charming.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.761
You know, EI,
if I may call you that...

15:32.933 --> 15:37.734
...I've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

15:37.938 --> 15:39.963
...have quite a price on your head.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.437
I wouldn't want to be you.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.511
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

15:48.682 --> 15:50.707
You tell me.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.216
I need you to kill a man.

15:54.454 --> 15:59.221
EI, you really must try this
because it's <i>puerco pibil.</i>

15:59.392 --> 16:03.260
It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...

16:03.430 --> 16:08.868
...and I order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

16:09.069 --> 16:14.132
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.468
In fact, it's too good.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.874
It's so good that when I'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

16:20.046 --> 16:22.844
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.584
Because that's what I do.
I restore the balance to this country.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.187
And that is what I would like
from you right now.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.620
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.658
- You want me to shoot the cook?
- No, I'll shoot the cook.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.127
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

16:39.132 --> 16:41.123
...will kill Marquez.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.303
Do you remember Gen. Marquez?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.706
He's being paid by Barillo...

16:48.875 --> 16:51.571
...to kill the president
in an attempted coup d'état.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.572
- Attempted?
- Oh, no. The president will be killed...

16:55.749 --> 16:59.515
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.144
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.486
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

17:06.659 --> 17:09.821
...after he's killed
the president. Savvy?

17:09.996 --> 17:13.829
- So why me?
- You've got nothing to live for...

17:14.034 --> 17:16.332
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.505
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.664
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.003
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

17:26.512 --> 17:31.041
And I will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.026
Was I right?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.323
I guess not.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.241
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

18:06.419 --> 18:08.614
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

18:08.788 --> 18:13.452
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

18:14.327 --> 18:17.785
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.195
With <i>el presidente's</i> new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...

18:21.401 --> 18:24.598
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

18:24.804 --> 18:29.537
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

18:29.709 --> 18:33.236
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

18:33.413 --> 18:38.544
This is a top priority of <i>el presidente.</i>
Who wants this?

18:39.486 --> 18:41.647
Romero, it's yours.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.415
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.025
That's all. Dismissed.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.189
I should take his left nut.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.099
You're with us.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.596
People of Culiacan.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.877
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

19:06.112 --> 19:09.843
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

19:10.016 --> 19:12.007
that is threatening our nation.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.413
People like Armando Barillo.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.120
I invite you to gather our forces...

19:17.290 --> 19:20.020
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

19:20.360 --> 19:22.885
...and our peace.

19:23.329 --> 19:28.995
<i>El presidente</i>, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...

19:29.202 --> 19:32.171
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

19:32.338 --> 19:35.273
...to take possession of a province.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.706
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.505
He doesn't own its people.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.240
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

19:43.416 --> 19:45.509
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.382
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.620
- He's a folk hero to them.
- He's also a mass murderer...

19:53.793 --> 19:55.761
...and a drug kingpin.

19:55.929 --> 19:59.888
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

20:00.066 --> 20:02.261
...but the people can see through that.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.900
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.473
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

20:11.144 --> 20:14.170
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.207
Then I will die fighting.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.819
Are you with me?

20:24.123 --> 20:25.784
To the death.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.963
What's wrong?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.370
Everything.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.706
This way!

21:56.883 --> 21:58.646
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

22:00.687 --> 22:03.747
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

22:03.923 --> 22:05.982
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

22:10.363 --> 22:12.194
Jump.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.434
Swing, swing, swing.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.643
- Hang on!
- What do you mean, hold on?

22:31.050 --> 22:32.483
Let go now!

23:12.158 --> 23:13.250
Give me that!

23:13.760 --> 23:15.591
Stop the bus.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.820
Stop the bus.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.926
A vow must be broken.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.493
Forgive me...

24:26.699 --> 24:28.894
for what I am about to become.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.805
- When was your last confession?
- An hour ago.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.739
- And the name of your priest?
- Sands.

24:38.911 --> 24:43.575
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter...

24:43.749 --> 24:45.512
- Yeah, I know.
- Failure to appear...

24:45.718 --> 24:47.845
...in locations at assigned times...

24:48.020 --> 24:52.457
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.354
- Yeah.
- You'll be paid.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.753
Coup d'états, like elections,
don't come cheap.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.161
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.502
There's more.
You will be a free man...

25:04.670 --> 25:08.606
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the president...

25:08.774 --> 25:11.743
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.436
- When do I begin?
- Give me a moment.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.522
It's a church, <i>hombre.</i>

26:35.194 --> 26:37.185
I'm sorry.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.806
Are you still standing?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.740
Still.

28:00.913 --> 28:05.111
<i>Good. Well, the Barillo cartel</i>
<i>aren't the nicest of guys, are they?</i>

28:05.685 --> 28:08.518
However, you've passed the test.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.622
You're gonna do just fine.

28:10.790 --> 28:15.159
Assemble your team, and I will
call you with further instructions.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.927
<i>Over and out.</i>

28:20.866 --> 28:26.395
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

28:26.605 --> 28:30.507
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

28:30.976 --> 28:34.810
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

28:34.980 --> 28:37.642
Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?

28:42.621 --> 28:44.350
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:44.523 --> 28:49.927
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.827
So I don't ever want to see you again.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.933
Fuck off.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.512
- Hi.
- Hello.

29:10.683 --> 29:13.777
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

29:13.953 --> 29:18.185
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, I just don't know what is.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.917
- I'm retired FBI.
- A real agent never retires.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.618
He just takes it a little easier.

29:24.029 --> 29:29.262
- Why are we talking?
- You tracked down Armando Barillo...

29:29.468 --> 29:32.835
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.496
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

29:35.708 --> 29:38.871
Well, he...

29:39.044 --> 29:43.708
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.214
I know.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.410
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.418
Can't be touched.

29:50.589 --> 29:53.922
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-10 criminal...

29:54.093 --> 29:57.995
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

29:58.164 --> 30:02.066
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.896
Now, retired or not...

30:05.104 --> 30:09.700
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.139
I'm a civilian now.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.743
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

30:15.915 --> 30:18.008
...Archuleta?

30:20.820 --> 30:22.117
Yes.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.647
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.817
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.361
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

30:32.531 --> 30:38.299
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

30:38.504 --> 30:43.032
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.002
You must have known that.

30:47.646 --> 30:51.946
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.677
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

30:55.454 --> 30:59.550
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.589
For your dead friend...

31:01.861 --> 31:04.489
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

31:04.663 --> 31:08.326
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

31:13.973 --> 31:18.000
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

31:18.444 --> 31:20.469
...the world.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.665
(Announcer)
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!

32:22.875 --> 32:24.365
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.406
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.113
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

32:33.419 --> 32:35.182
Where the hell have you been?

32:35.821 --> 32:37.015
Far away.

32:38.057 --> 32:38.921
Still fucking around?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.753
Let me get Fideo.

32:44.029 --> 32:46.361
I'm here for my guitar.

32:54.907 --> 32:57.034
It's his last night.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.972
They're firing him.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.571
Hey...

33:02.948 --> 33:05.576
...Fideo, it's me.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.186
- Still drinking.
- Like a fish.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.325
I guess we haven't changed so much.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.729
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.333
Neither did I.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.732
Are we on?

33:26.071 --> 33:29.063
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

33:31.076 --> 33:37.015
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

33:37.182 --> 33:38.444
...coffee.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.585
Lots of coffee.

33:41.887 --> 33:45.914
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.251
One...

33:47.693 --> 33:51.959
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

33:54.033 --> 33:57.059
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

33:57.669 --> 34:01.537
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

34:01.740 --> 34:07.303
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

34:07.479 --> 34:11.574
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.750
Of course it is.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.679
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

34:15.853 --> 34:17.879
Creative sportsmanship.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.820
In other words...

34:26.231 --> 34:28.755
...one has to rig the game.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.561
Go collect.

34:44.116 --> 34:47.574
<i>El presidente</i> is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...

34:47.753 --> 34:49.277
...in the town of Culiacan.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.922
He's going to be isolated...

34:51.090 --> 34:54.786
...in the main <i>edificio</i>
in the center of the plaza.

34:55.060 --> 34:58.052
Very easy access to him if...

34:58.230 --> 34:59.527
...somebody can get you in.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.694
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.836
I am not the prince.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.598
I am the man behind the prince.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.571
- I see.
- He's not the first prince I've served...

35:11.743 --> 35:14.303
...nor the first one that I've betrayed.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.512
- You're a good rat. I like you.
- I try.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.183
The rest upon completion.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.619
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>
- Right. Right.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.756
Every goddamn time.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.534
What do you want in life?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.472
Belini...

37:26.645 --> 37:30.342
...how long have you and I
done business together?

37:30.515 --> 37:32.415
A long time.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.518
And in a way...

37:34.686 --> 37:39.248
...I kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.119
Almost.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.488
But you need to stop farting around.

37:43.662 --> 37:47.189
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

37:47.366 --> 37:49.596
I have what you need.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.737
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.531
That make you nervous?

37:55.741 --> 37:59.108
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

37:59.311 --> 38:00.869
...is a serious offense.

38:01.079 --> 38:04.947
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

38:05.117 --> 38:08.746
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

38:08.920 --> 38:11.286
...and skull-fucking you to death.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.118
No.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.128
I'm fine. Go away.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.993
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.762
Leave me alone.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.104
That spill just cost you your life.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.661
A little help.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.373
Okay.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.279
I know it's on you somewhere.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.008
Somewhere.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.486
All right.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.758
Time to get messy.

39:41.012 --> 39:44.778
Well, I suppose I should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.180
However.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.498
You're about a quart low.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.747
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.945
- Why doesn't my key work anymore?
- It's too small.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.320
- Stand back.
- I just... I brought you a gift.

40:30.495 --> 40:31.792
I'm still mad at you.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.228
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So...

40:36.701 --> 40:38.396
Come closer and I'll thank you.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.842
- Are you trying to give me a boner?
- Closer, I said.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.106
How about that little tip-off?

40:47.279 --> 40:51.648
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.785
Even from your twisted little agency.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.943
I'm impressed.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.180
- But then what?
- Want to hear my plan?

40:58.356 --> 41:00.950
Either that or I start target practice.

41:01.126 --> 41:07.395
Okay. The new president is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

41:07.566 --> 41:10.660
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

41:10.869 --> 41:14.270
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.999
<i>He wants him</i>
<i>to throw a coup d'état...</i>

41:17.209 --> 41:20.372
<i>... while the president's</i>
<i>visiting Culiacan.</i>

41:20.545 --> 41:23.605
<i>Now, I have a man inside</i>
<i>as insurance...</i>

41:23.782 --> 41:26.216
...<i>to make sure that Marquez</i>
<i>never takes power.</i>

41:26.384 --> 41:29.012
The last piece of the puzzle...

41:30.655 --> 41:33.886
...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures...

41:34.426 --> 41:37.987
...<i>that Barillo is out of the picture</i>
<i>while the battle ensues.</i>

41:38.163 --> 41:42.463
<i>In the aftermath</i>
<i>of this very healthy revolution...</i>

41:42.667 --> 41:47.764
...<i>I will calmly waltz away with</i>
<i>the 20 million pesos...</i>

41:47.973 --> 41:51.409
...<i>that Barillo is prepared to pay</i>
<i>Marquez for the coup.</i>

41:51.576 --> 41:54.101
- You want me to go with you?
- You detain Barillo...

41:54.279 --> 41:57.578
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

41:57.749 --> 41:59.683
...and share the spoils.

42:03.989 --> 42:06.287
You meet me two nights from now...

42:06.458 --> 42:08.892
...at La Pileta, 10 p.m. Sharp...

42:09.060 --> 42:12.291
...and bring only
what's important to you.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.694
Oh, yeah.

42:16.968 --> 42:20.495
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So...

42:22.107 --> 42:24.132
- Can you dig it?
- I can dig it.

42:24.476 --> 42:26.637
I want my key back.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.946
Testing. One, two. Testing.

43:17.629 --> 43:18.926
Hello?

43:19.097 --> 43:20.928
Can you hear me now?

43:21.433 --> 43:24.095
Okay... Fucking bells.

43:24.636 --> 43:26.604
Did you assemble your team?

43:26.771 --> 43:28.568
You know I did.

43:29.074 --> 43:33.010
- Why are you having me followed?
- <i>Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...</i>

43:33.178 --> 43:35.305
...guarantee of compliance, shall we?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.243
Because Cucuy also...

43:37.415 --> 43:40.316
- <i>... provides protection.</i>
- From what? Mosquitoes?

43:40.485 --> 43:43.420
<i>Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess</i>
<i>with him if I were you...</i>

43:43.588 --> 43:45.453
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

43:45.624 --> 43:48.684
<i>And he's not the happiest</i>
<i>that you killed his man.</i>

43:49.260 --> 43:52.127
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way,</i>
<i>I have your next assignment.</i>

44:03.341 --> 44:05.332
You the Mariachis?

44:19.658 --> 44:23.150
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.869
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.345
Who are they?

44:41.613 --> 44:43.046
Musicians.

44:48.887 --> 44:51.355
Why so heavy?

44:52.991 --> 44:55.186
Built in amplifier.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.256
Play something.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.925
All right.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.175
Let's go.

45:22.921 --> 45:26.118
- I was afraid you couldn't play.
- Are you kidding?

46:14.839 --> 46:17.171
What we are looking for is support

46:17.375 --> 46:19.036
from the people of this state.

46:19.511 --> 46:21.809
A man can do a lot alone,

46:22.747 --> 46:26.308
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

46:27.418 --> 46:30.080
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

46:31.055 --> 46:36.186
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, <i>cabrón</i>.

46:46.504 --> 46:47.732
Hey.

46:47.939 --> 46:51.375
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

46:57.248 --> 46:59.409
Is there a particular song you
would like to hear?

47:18.169 --> 47:22.037
We just played for <i>el presidente</i>,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!

47:23.241 --> 47:24.731
It was meant as an honor.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.703
Fuck honor.

47:27.045 --> 47:30.173
- We need money.
- The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.680
Even for you, Lorenzo.

47:32.851 --> 47:36.412
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

47:36.588 --> 47:38.419
Only revenge.

47:39.324 --> 47:41.690
Much delayed revenge.

47:47.332 --> 47:48.993
Go practice.

47:49.901 --> 47:51.391
Practice?

47:52.036 --> 47:55.164
Playing or shooting?

47:55.373 --> 47:56.931
What do you think?

47:57.609 --> 47:59.474
I don't think. I drink.

48:08.086 --> 48:10.247
- Yeah, hello.
- Been following Barillo...

48:10.421 --> 48:15.085
...and the good Dr. Guevera.
- Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

48:15.260 --> 48:19.094
- Good man. Welcome to the fold.
- I haven't seen illegal activities yet.

48:19.264 --> 48:22.461
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

48:22.634 --> 48:23.965
<i>... on November 2.</i>

48:24.168 --> 48:26.159
The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow.

48:26.371 --> 48:29.932
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

48:30.141 --> 48:33.440
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

48:33.611 --> 48:36.580
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

48:36.748 --> 48:38.807
- Bet my badge on it.
- <i>Well...</i>

48:38.983 --> 48:41.747
<i>... whatever they're up to,</i>
<i>I can guarantee you...</i>

48:41.920 --> 48:43.945
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.818
- <i>So I suggest you</i>...
- What's going down tomorrow?

48:46.991 --> 48:49.016
If you see an opening, take it.

48:49.193 --> 48:52.754
- What do you know?
- Not enough. Get inside.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.296
I've got nothing.

49:01.706 --> 49:04.368
I gotta get in. I got nothing.

49:05.209 --> 49:08.372
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

49:10.848 --> 49:13.009
What are you gonna do, stupid?

49:17.622 --> 49:19.920
Billy Chambers is on the move.

49:23.661 --> 49:25.652
Where are you going?

49:28.900 --> 49:30.993
You're buying a taco.

49:31.769 --> 49:33.100
This is too easy.

49:33.504 --> 49:35.438
Where are the other guys?

49:36.407 --> 49:38.307
This is a setup.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.903
It smells like a setup.

49:47.719 --> 49:49.516
I'm making my move.

50:25.923 --> 50:27.754
Billy Chambers.

50:30.061 --> 50:33.428
- Well, that depends who's asking.
- I thought that was you.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.557
- Here, let me pay for this.
- Oh, well, thanks.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.197
Oh, goddamn it.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.466
- Is that real?
- Yes, it is.

50:44.776 --> 50:47.677
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

50:49.414 --> 50:50.938
Whoa, hey, friend.

50:52.450 --> 50:54.042
You ain't gonna need that.

50:54.252 --> 50:57.813
Believe it or not, man, I'm ready to go.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.582
Let's talk over there.

51:02.693 --> 51:04.490
After you.

51:09.367 --> 51:12.029
Man, I just wanna get out of here.

51:12.370 --> 51:15.134
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

51:15.306 --> 51:19.504
...for the last eight goddamn years.

51:19.677 --> 51:24.114
And I've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

51:24.549 --> 51:27.882
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

51:28.052 --> 51:31.112
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

51:31.789 --> 51:33.552
Jorge Ramirez.

51:33.724 --> 51:38.218
I'll take you in under the FBI's
supervision and protection...

51:38.396 --> 51:44.266
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

51:44.469 --> 51:46.664
- In the U.S.?
- In the U.S.

51:48.372 --> 51:52.399
The things that I've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

51:52.610 --> 51:56.068
...unspeakable.
- You don't know what Barillo's up to?

51:56.247 --> 51:58.272
I'm close to the man.

51:58.716 --> 52:00.877
I'm real close.

52:01.052 --> 52:03.782
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

52:03.988 --> 52:06.115
Can you get him close to Barillo?

52:10.828 --> 52:12.261
Him?

52:13.097 --> 52:15.065
I need your help.

52:20.104 --> 52:21.799
Then you get me out of here.

52:22.306 --> 52:24.035
Then I'll get you out of here.

52:25.576 --> 52:26.677
Him too.

52:26.677 --> 52:27.439
Him too.

53:04.649 --> 53:07.311
There's cartel on every corner.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.212
Sands told me you handle protection.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.755
I don't work for Sands anymore.

53:14.926 --> 53:18.020
And since I'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever I want.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.998
Then I guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.691
- Goodbye.
- There's a price on your head.

53:25.036 --> 53:28.836
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

53:29.006 --> 53:31.668
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

53:31.842 --> 53:33.104
And if I don't?

53:33.277 --> 53:35.939
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

53:36.113 --> 53:38.274
What if your whole village was next?

53:40.818 --> 53:42.615
Would you kill them?

53:42.787 --> 53:45.221
Me? They certainly would.

53:48.025 --> 53:50.255
Then I guess I have no choice...

53:51.329 --> 53:53.229
...but to kill you all.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.601
You...

54:07.044 --> 54:08.341
...are last.

56:17.375 --> 56:20.276
That should put him out
for a few days...

56:20.911 --> 56:23.243
...and give him some nasty dreams.

56:29.487 --> 56:31.819
You have to relax your fingers.

56:33.724 --> 56:36.784
Music is pure, from one's soul.

56:38.062 --> 56:44.262
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.

56:52.443 --> 56:54.673
And if the soul isn't pure?

56:55.513 --> 56:57.504
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.

56:58.682 --> 57:00.707
I present to you...

57:01.385 --> 57:03.410
...Señor Cucuy.

57:05.823 --> 57:09.156
Get this condescending ass
out of here.

57:10.494 --> 57:12.189
You want me to break his fingers?

57:12.363 --> 57:14.695
No. I want you to chop them off.

57:16.333 --> 57:19.769
- I was just making a joke.
- I wasn't.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.242
Sit, please.

57:32.416 --> 57:33.815
So...

57:33.984 --> 57:37.385
...you are the man who brought us...

57:37.555 --> 57:39.250
...the Mariachi.

57:39.924 --> 57:43.189
The man I work for, Mr. Sands...

57:43.594 --> 57:47.530
...he is using the Mariachi
to kill Gen. Marquez.

57:47.698 --> 57:49.859
So you want to join us...

57:50.067 --> 57:51.864
...here's how it works.

57:52.069 --> 57:55.266
There is the bait. There is the trade.

57:55.473 --> 57:58.237
A favor for a favor.

57:59.810 --> 58:02.404
So El Mariachi is the trade?

58:03.647 --> 58:05.114
You are.

58:20.631 --> 58:21.996
This ain't my line of work.

58:32.309 --> 58:34.072
This guy's all fucked up.

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:28.047
General Marquez is arriving!

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.587
Bring out the Mariachi!

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:40.270
Bring him out to the General!

01:00:57.655 --> 01:01:00.852
I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:04.327
But I see now...

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:07.260
that blood will spill again.

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:13.431
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.437
He escaped.

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:17.899
You too will escape.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.052
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore...

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.062
Why?

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.399
Practice shooting, not drinking.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:54.838
We are on.

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:16.160
By order of the President, they
are searching all vehicles

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.163
for guns and drugs.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.825
That fucker's been blockading
all the roads.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.503
Take us back another way.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.931
By order of the president.

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:28.475
Who does this guy think he is?

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:30.476
He wants to get rid of me?

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:32.308
Fine.

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:34.380
<i>I'll get rid of him.</i>

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:36.610
<i>Replace him, even.</i>

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.584
<i>Then I will simply disappear.</i>

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.754
Hey, <i>vámonos</i>, man.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:05.110
Don't put me out completely.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.483
Have my men wait outside.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:59.026
Barillo and Dr. Guevera
must already be inside the building...

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:03.105
...having entered
through the back or basement.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:07.069
They should be midprocedure.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:13.939
Federal agents.

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:17.887
This is going down now.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:20.437
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities...

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.635
...he succeeded.

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:30.620
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially-completed...

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:35.622
...facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:08.550
They switched bodies.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.392
Barillo!

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.336
FBI.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.870
He was anyway.
Bring him along.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.979
Listen, I cannot do everything
by myself.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:12.053
I need someone
to go in there with me.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:15.157
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:19.421
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.622
Plus, I'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:27.532
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army...

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.102
...but they've got no guns.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:32.707
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:36.367
...because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:37.877
Hello?

01:08:38.048 --> 01:08:39.743
Hello? Are you there?

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:42.680
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:01.564
I would like the <i>puerco pibil</i>
and a tequila with lime.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:12.307
Yeah, listen, I need a new line.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.073
This one's been compromised.

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:17.319
Okay? Thank you.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.581
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.122
That's right.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:25.386
The Flying Cow.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.126
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:51.979
Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't
interested in your scheme.

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.945
Too small.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:59.754
Oh, my Christ. Is that Barillo?

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:04.383
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:07.621
What kind of cartel would have you
running its operation?

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.399
I'm his daughter.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.629
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.174
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line...

01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:24.939
...and you will have every marine
from here to Guantánamo Bay...

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:29.108
...up your keister, mister.
So just know that.

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:34.815
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:39.052
You have only seen too much.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:45.096
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:00.245
On this day of the dead,

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:03.176
I offer you a chance for a new life.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.257
That sounded a little extreme
for a parade.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.298
Troops are coming up
from the south.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.935
- Whose?
- Emiliano Marquez.

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:25.004
- Well, what do we do?
- We stay here. This place is fortified.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:29.968
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.980
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:39.516
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:57.468
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.074
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:06.512
I set them up.
I watch them fall.

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:14.414
I'm living <i>la vida loca</i>.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.365
No!

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.508
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.708
I will give you this...

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.214
...if you'll be my eyes.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:50.484
It's a dollar.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:52.016
I meant...

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:53.892
...this.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:57.130
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.

01:13:58.368 --> 01:13:59.960
Is someone following you?

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:03.728
It's difficult for me to tell right now
because I'm having a bad day.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.999
Do you see someone?

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:10.136
Yes, he's getting close.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.208
Listen, have you ever seen
one of these?

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.179
Have you used one?

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.552
Don't ever,
because they're bad.

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:24.249
But what I need for you to do
is to aim this...

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:28.420
...at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:29.826
Kill him?

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:33.696
Oh, yeah. Very <i>mátalo</i>.
Close?

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.064
Okay. Smoke him.

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:43.536
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:47.038
What?

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:50.319
Okay. Come here.

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:55.914
Right or left?

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.291
Was that my right or your right?

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:29.454
Wrong man.

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:32.919
Sorry.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.340
Look me in the eyes...

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:54.075
...and then kill me.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:15.837
Good boy. Now you're thinking.

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:20.499
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:44.791
For you...

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.629
for our daughter...

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.741
for Mexico.

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:32.608
In my past, I'd take on evil
from the bottom.

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:35.548
Now I realize...

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.345
...start at the top.

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:42.080
The president is a good man.

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:46.289
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:51.862
Watch him.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:05.243
We could torture him.

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.074
He's FBI.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:12.050
He's retired.

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:13.883
That doesn't count.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.623
I was tortured once.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:21.263
I didn't like it.

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:24.426
You know what the fucked up thing is?

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:27.327
They tore out my left nut.

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:33.909
That sort of turned me off of the
whole thing.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.877
What should we do with him?

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:43.149
Let's go eat about it.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:59.195
Hey Snow White, watch that
fucking pig.

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:13.508
Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:26.085
What the fuck?!

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.424
I don't like military.

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:43.035
Get out.

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:45.673
- Why are we stopping?
- We can't go further.

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:49.515
- Why not?
- Look out there. It's a coup d'état!

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:53.416
I can't see, fuck-mook!
I have no eyes.

01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:56.888
Well, then listen to it, fucker!

01:19:57.059 --> 01:20:01.519
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:04.096
You guys have to get out now.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:13.798
Keep your money because
I'm not moving one inch.

01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:58.437
Fuck! Now what?

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:01.482
- Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah.

01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:03.585
These are much better.

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:28.904
What do you want in life?

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:32.310
Good choice.

01:22:44.327 --> 01:22:45.555
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:46.922
Okay, let's go!

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.704
It's no longer safe to be here.
Let's go.

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.993
You have a meeting
with Gen. Marquez, sir.

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.784
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:57.918
Who are you guys?

01:24:58.994 --> 01:25:00.928
Sons of Mexico, sir.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:13.341
Are we in front of the building?

01:25:23.586 --> 01:25:24.575
Okay.

01:25:26.889 --> 01:25:28.754
This is it, kid.

01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:34.987
I don't hear you running.

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:10.516
Why would they want me dead?
I've done nothing but help them.

01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:13.685
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:15.830
Look out there! You see?

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.260
Well, don't look too close, <i>presidente</i>.

01:27:20.469 --> 01:27:23.632
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:25.329
Take off your jacket.

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:27.441
- This also?
- Yes.

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:29.402
Put this on.

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.001
What is this, payoff?

01:28:03.178 --> 01:28:05.203
This is money someone paid
to kill you.

01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:08.316
And now it's money
to save your life, <i>presidente</i>.

01:28:08.651 --> 01:28:11.518
Here, get some tequila for yourself.

01:28:47.723 --> 01:28:49.953
Leave here and lock the door.

01:28:58.334 --> 01:28:59.733
Carolina?

01:29:02.438 --> 01:29:03.564
She died.

01:29:05.708 --> 01:29:06.732
Your daughter?

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:09.735
She died.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.869
And you?

01:29:16.985 --> 01:29:17.849
Dead.

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:21.446
And I?

01:29:22.825 --> 01:29:24.053
Alive and well.

01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:41.437
In hell.

01:29:58.394 --> 01:30:01.420
Everything in its place...

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.786
You fucking little monkey.

01:31:09.498 --> 01:31:11.193
Stand up.

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:20.074
See anything you like?

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:35.479
No.

01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:05.012
Do you remember a man
named Archuleta?

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:07.178
Why?

01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:12.187
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.

01:32:14.329 --> 01:32:19.733
You tortured and murdered Agent
Archuleta. He was my partner.

01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:21.626
He was also my friend.

01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:27.173
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.

01:32:27.342 --> 01:32:30.243
Oh, I'm retired.

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:34.371
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:36.984
- Mr. Chambers.
- Yes, sir.

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:38.915
You're just going to stand there?

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:43.047
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:48.828
You leave me no choice.

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:58.290
Did you get your man?

01:33:58.467 --> 01:33:59.627
One of them.

01:34:01.737 --> 01:34:07.471
If that isn't interagency cooperation,
I just don't know what is.

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.941
See you later.

01:34:12.714 --> 01:34:14.443
Fuck you.

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:18.910
Are you okay?

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:21.521
I don't know.

01:34:22.891 --> 01:34:24.791
You will be.

01:35:32.994 --> 01:35:36.452
What do you want in life?

01:35:39.401 --> 01:35:40.993
To be free...

01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:44.372
Simple.

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:48.369
No.
