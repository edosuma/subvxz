WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:05.540
( birds cawing,
chirping )

00:08.300 --> 00:11.007
( insects chirping )

00:17.976 --> 00:20.308
( music playing )

00:40.832 --> 00:44.165
( twigs snapping,
leaves rustling )

00:44.211 --> 00:46.042
( rifle cocks )

00:52.970 --> 00:54.585
( panting )

01:01.979 --> 01:05.813
( running footsteps )

01:05.857 --> 01:07.688
( snapping twigs )

01:07.734 --> 01:09.395
(gasps )

01:09.444 --> 01:11.025
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:11.071 --> 01:14.063
( panting )

01:14.116 --> 01:16.152
The Trimbols are dead.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.112
What? Wh...

01:18.161 --> 01:20.447
Alicia: After they left,
they were killed.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.453
It was
Walker's people.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.864
You tell anyone
you were coming?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.703
You didn't want
anyone to know.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.414
You didn't want anyone to
stop you, but this changes things.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.793
l was worried.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.129
Vernon and Kathy?
Mike?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.968
- And Gretchen.
- Son of a bitch.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.474
Talking to Walker right now,
it's not a good idea.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.980
This... this makes it more urgent,
more reason to go, not less.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.109
When I said for you to own it,
I didn't mean this.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.646
I'm not doing this because
of what you said, Alicia.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.939
Right.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.157
I'm coming with you.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.661
No, you're not.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.964
( music playing )

02:20.349 --> 02:23.261
It's... it's a gas station.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.891
Tribal headquarters.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.019
Their land runs 10 miles
in either direction.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.522
What happens next?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.353
We walk in.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.983
( quiet chatter)

02:41.036 --> 02:42.151
( dog barking )

02:42.204 --> 02:43.614
Man:
Hands.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.922
( quiet chatter)

03:06.228 --> 03:09.265
( dogs barking )

03:14.194 --> 03:16.150
( man screaming )

03:17.781 --> 03:20.818
(people shouting )

03:22.452 --> 03:24.864
- ( man screaming )
- (people cheering )

03:29.376 --> 03:30.582
Qaletaqa!

03:45.142 --> 03:46.678
Hello, Taqa.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.686
You're 200 years
too late for peace, Jake.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.312
But just in time
for lunch.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.683
(gasps )

04:19.551 --> 04:22.258
- ( quiet chatter)
( distant sheep bleating )

04:22.304 --> 04:24.465
( music playing )

04:27.476 --> 04:30.934
Alicia didn't
come home last night.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.640
She's a big girl now.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.520
I don't think
she's in the camp.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.898
She's probably
with Golden Boy.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.979
Strange not to see
either of them,

04:39.029 --> 04:41.065
all the shit
that went down.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.481
- Will you go to Jake's?
- No.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.321
Leave her be, Mom.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.577
Morning.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.159
You, uh, seen
your daughter?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.288
No.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.374
Jake's AWOL with some gear
and he's not in his quarters.

04:58.423 --> 05:03.588
I know your daughter and him
are, uh... courting.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.049
Could theyjust sneak
past the guards?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.633
There's a lot of acreage
out there,

05:07.682 --> 05:10.094
and Jake does know
every inch of it,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.226
so it could be.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.183
Well, where should
we start looking?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.770
- We don't.
- What?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.650
I can't spare
another search party,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.526
and I'm not sending
these good folks out there

05:22.572 --> 05:25.655
after all that's happened...
Indians on the warpath.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.282
Point me
in the right direction.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.870
You won't make it
a mile out there.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.827
So what, I just sit around,
thumb up my ass, like you?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.828
You feel strong, son?
Hmm?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.793
Wanna arm up, man up?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.636
He'll fix it up
so it's not like

05:47.681 --> 05:49.592
we're sending a sheep
out to slaughter.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.143
- I'm in.
- Nick, come on.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.027
Jake: My father will never
abandon the ranch.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.608
You know that.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.655
Then we'll feed him
to the crows

06:07.701 --> 06:09.566
like Phil McCarthy.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.827
Then Russell Brown
and Vernon Trimbol.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.488
Russell's dead.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.202
The adobe burned.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.165
That karma's overdue
but welcomed.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.296
Vernon Trimbol's dead, too.

06:23.341 --> 06:27.425
I hope it was a long
and... painful illness.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.131
He died with his family.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.261
His wife, his daughter.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.720
You killed them.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.148
Is this girl
speaking for you?

06:44.029 --> 06:46.145
We need the violence
to stop.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.859
Soon will, Jake.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.944
Three down,

06:49.993 --> 06:51.824
one to go.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.577
My father never did anything
to you or your people.

06:54.623 --> 06:58.207
Tell me, Junior, do the lies turn
your stomach?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.957
Do you taste the bile
in the back of your throat?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.368
State police
investigated this.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.877
They found
no correlation between...

07:02.923 --> 07:05.414
( bangs table )
Stop... talking.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.503
You're boring me,
like you did in court.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.588
Those days are dead.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.594
I thought we had
an understanding,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.426
even outside of court.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.716
I understood.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.305
When you came here
with your drunk friends,

07:17.354 --> 07:19.936
l was to serve them their food
with a smile on my face,

07:19.981 --> 07:23.394
tolerate their slurs,
clean up their vomit in the toilet,

07:23.443 --> 07:26.731
and thank them for their
pocket-change tips.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.987
The days of the white man's
courts are over.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.820
Land grabs,
desecrations, over.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.576
Now you have our verdict,

07:35.622 --> 07:38.329
the first humans'
verdict.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.956
You must vacate our lands.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.122
l was hoping for a parley.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.965
A chance to negotiate
and to avoid more loss.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.844
- Maybe you're right.
( door opens )

08:00.897 --> 08:03.104
If a parley
can spare blood...

08:05.026 --> 08:06.641
we can talk about it.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.107
( kitchenware clattering )
- After we eat.

08:20.959 --> 08:21.914
(sighs )

08:21.960 --> 08:23.541
(gunfire)

08:26.881 --> 08:29.338
- Give them a half-hour, okay?
- Okay.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.966
( distant man shouting )
- ( gunfire continues)

08:33.471 --> 08:34.927
Here to sign up.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.432
Got a note from home?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.728
That's funny.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.681
No, I'm serious.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.187
Madison okay with this?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.814
You want to go ask her?
You need her permission?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.693
Why, though?
Why... whyjoin the militia?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.606
I don't know,
maybe, uh...

08:54.659 --> 08:57.492
| feel bad
about what I've done.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.323
You ever feel that way
about anything?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.580
You know,
you do something, then people die.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.286
And then things get worse.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.090
Maybe you should leave
before worse things happen.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.126
Yeah.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.715
I got Travis killed,

09:15.764 --> 09:18.676
and now my mom
has to bear that loss.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.716
And my sister's missing.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.259
I need an occupation.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.143
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.773
Also, I want
to protect us

09:35.825 --> 09:38.862
from the ones
who killed the Trimbols.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.324
What I saw was savage.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.660
Lefs,uhn.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.916
let's not spook
the young recruits, huh?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.915
Here.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.218
( truck approaches )

10:02.143 --> 10:03.428
How the hell'd
you get here?

10:03.478 --> 10:04.934
It's a long story.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.392
Tell it.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.898
Tell me, then I'll tell you
how I tried to find you

10:10.944 --> 10:13.731
and almost got goddamn eaten,
how we all almost died

10:13.780 --> 10:16.066
because you took the truck
and the hotel was overrun.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.572
Alicia, I thought
it was safe.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.153
- We checked every room.
- Nowhere is safe.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.158
Sorry.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.455
If it makes you feel any better,
I almost died after that.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.459
It doesn't.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.968
Qaletaqa found me.
He took me in.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.674
- These are good people.
- Well, these good people,

10:40.723 --> 10:42.634
they killed a family
two nights ago.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.847
- His daughter was my friend.
- No, there was no...

10:45.895 --> 10:47.726
there was no mission
two nights ago.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.057
How do you know that?

10:49.107 --> 10:51.143
Taqa goes out
with the war parties.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.059
- He didn't. He was with me.
- (gate opens)

10:58.867 --> 11:00.528
Jake:
We have a parley.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.319
I need you to go back
and tell my father the terms.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.872
Taqa will send
a scout with you.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.415
You're staying here?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.413
We swap hostages
and offer tribute.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.040
Jake, your father's
not gonna listen to me.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.702
- He barely knows me.
- Alicia...

11:12.755 --> 11:16.543
this is the only way
to put off their attack.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.424
Taqa guarantees my safety.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.754
His word is good.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.467
Then I'll stay.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.346
No.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.678
Jake, your father needs
to hear this from you.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.394
You have to sell it.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.556
Do we have a parley
or not?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.944
It appears we do.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.697
( music playing )

11:44.954 --> 11:46.239
Okay.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.749
( Madison sighs )

12:16.653 --> 12:19.110
Do l have to worry?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.020
I'd rather back the militia
when we're attacked

12:21.074 --> 12:23.156
than hold the rear
with the old-timers.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.407
If there's an attack.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.574
You gonna go
back-to-back with Troy?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.534
Keep your enemies
close, right?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.743
Is that what this is?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.086
How do I look?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.762
( music playing )

12:56.234 --> 12:58.190
Man:
Jake! Jake!

12:58.236 --> 12:59.817
( gate opens )

13:06.286 --> 13:08.242
What? Ofelia?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.324
- Madison.
- What the hell's going on?

13:10.373 --> 13:12.659
Alicia followed me
to Black Hat.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.166
- What happened to her?
- She's safe, she's safe.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.668
- I made a deal with Walker.
- You left her?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.545
- It's part of the custom.
- Alicia's their hostage.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.205
I'm the hostage
on this side.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.250
What kind of barbaric
bullshit is that? What custom?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.715
Alicia offered to stay
to avoid more bloodshed.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.970
The sooner I talk to my father,
the sooner we get her back.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.007
And if not?
How much time is sooner?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.095
Just travel back and forth,
plus a day to talk.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.807
And we will get her back.
Walker gave me his word.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.938
Walker is a killer.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.224
I promise you
I would not have left her there

13:39.277 --> 13:41.268
if I didn't think
she was gonna be safe.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.731
I care about her.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.903
How long were you
at that place?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.114
Long enough to know
that Walker's word is good.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.529
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.413
He told me he wanted us
off the ranch.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.916
Said he'd kill us if we stayed.
Has that changed?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.667
Only Jake
would know that.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.628
Walker:
Water is precious.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.512
You'll have to learn
to conserve,

14:10.558 --> 14:12.514
especially
in the kitchen.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.721
I'm not gonna be here
for that long.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.183
You'll contribute
while you are.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.643
Is a hostage
the same thing as a prisoner?

14:22.320 --> 14:26.108
We call ourselves
pony warriors

14:26.157 --> 14:29.524
even though we drive
Jeeps, trucks.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.535
Soon we'll have
our own air force.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.662
Jose and Marta,
two of the best mechanics

14:34.707 --> 14:37.449
out of the Iraq war.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.958
It was good shooting.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.800
Crazy Dog
was an Army sniper.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.254
Your America ’s offered us
some useful tools.

14:47.303 --> 14:51.296
Took everything,
but gave us some things in trade.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.135
The sun had set.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.470
We had waited there
all day.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.933
We were about to head back
when we heard it.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.266
I know.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.653
l was on it
when you shot us down.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.986
You were lucky
to have made it.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.117
We were hoping it was
one of the Ottos.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.120
Jake wasn't
the only one.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.122
It was one
of my family members.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.091
You killed him.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.631
You hate me.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.639
Good.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.765
Maybe you can understand

15:36.811 --> 15:39.427
the anger l have
towards the Ottos.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.311
Magnify that hate
a thousand times,

15:41.357 --> 15:43.473
and maybe you can
understand.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.733
I do hate you.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.270
I hate you
for killing Travis,

15:49.323 --> 15:51.154
for thinking you know
how I feel.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.610
You don't.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.613
You're just a hypocrite

15:58.666 --> 16:01.328
playing the noble
Native American.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.753
They need water.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.383
There's nothing left
in their catch basins.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.885
The drought's
five years old now,

16:12.930 --> 16:15.922
- and they're desperate.
- Damn right.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.511
Grasshopper and the ant.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.017
And they're ready
to take it from us.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.438
Let them come.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.432
Can't we try
and find a way?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.101
He seemed appeased
by my offer

16:28.154 --> 16:29.644
to give him
our bottled reserves.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.313
No!
We might need them.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.822
We can replenish
from our wells.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.109
- And when they go dry?
Have they ever?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.743
Without rain?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.120
Yeah, one day.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.906
Especially if gotta we share
with those assholes.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.950
We share or we risk war.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.541
You think that'll
satisfy Walker, huh?

16:47.590 --> 16:51.503
You think they'll take one drop
and not want a gallon?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.463
He'll want everything.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.004
We could lose everything, Dad,
if we don't meet him halfway.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.218
I'd rather be dead than meet
with that son of a bitch.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.598
And what about Alicia?

16:59.644 --> 17:01.054
Did you know he left
my daughter behind

17:01.103 --> 17:03.310
with those... those...

17:03.356 --> 17:05.187
Savages?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.349
Yeah, actually,
I did know.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.187
And we got a lady
in return.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.523
But I hear
Alicia volunteered.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.948
Guess the apple
don't fall far

17:12.990 --> 17:14.730
when it comes to
pain-in-the-ass predicaments.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.820
She's only 18!

17:16.869 --> 17:20.407
You know, in the old days,
what, a couple of months ago,

17:20.456 --> 17:23.118
18 was considered
an adult.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.909
Even adults make decisions
put themselves in danger.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.748
She's not in danger as long
as we honor the parley.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.753
What planet are you on?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.755
I saw what happened
at the outpost,

17:31.801 --> 17:33.337
what Walker did
at the outpost.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.672
There are things at play here
you can't fathom.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.257
You're an outsider.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.762
You need to learn
a little faith.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.517
What are you gonna do
about this?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.809
But you won 't negotiate.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.314
( laughs )

17:49.360 --> 17:52.978
Madison, I would not piss
in that man's mouth

17:53.030 --> 17:55.612
if he was dying of thirst.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.148
Jake can make his play,

17:57.201 --> 18:00.659
but I can tell you
right now, this parley?

18:00.705 --> 18:01.785
Snakebit.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.623
( quiet chatter)

18:34.947 --> 18:36.858
Fake.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.114
Paper-mache.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.446
Tourists used to pay
a couple of bucks to see it.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.621
But this...

18:49.962 --> 18:51.827
is not
for tourists' eyes.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.344
This is real.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.060
My great-grandfather.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.811
Shouldn't he be buried?

19:09.857 --> 19:12.473
He was.
In a cave.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.027
I desecrated his grave to save it
from the Ottos and their fortune hunters.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.318
Generations trapped
in this sideshow trailer...

19:23.371 --> 19:24.827
travesty.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.292
I hope one day my
great-grandfather forgives me.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.419
When I can put
all of this back.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.268
I was thinking
the other day

19:49.313 --> 19:52.601
the idea of an afterlife
doesn't make sense.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.312
It's so hard
to get out of this life.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.984
It's all part
of a grand plan...

20:07.248 --> 20:09.864
one that's been taking place
before the dead walked.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.834
Do you know
what "apocalypse" means?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.255
The end of the world.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.919
No.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.381
It means
the Great Unveiling.

20:22.430 --> 20:25.718
When I started collecting
relics to save them,

20:25.766 --> 20:29.600
I kept seeing a theme,
in petroglyphs,

20:29.645 --> 20:31.931
cave paintings,
tanned hides.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.987
Prophecies of what
we're going through right now...

20:41.031 --> 20:44.865
dawn of a new age

20:44.910 --> 20:47.617
when the land will be shed
of the impure.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.540
Impure, like the Ottos.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.831
Like me.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.172
It's been
a long struggle,

21:00.217 --> 21:03.926
but it was foretold
that we would not lose.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.677
After the apocalypse,
all of this

21:05.723 --> 21:08.430
will be returned to us,
the first humans.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.521
Your friend Ofelia's
either lying or very stupid.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.232
She's her father's daughter.
She's not stupid.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.737
If Walker's gonna
take this place...

21:23.783 --> 21:26.024
- Try to.
- Try to...

21:26.076 --> 21:28.203
She needs to be on what
she thinks is the winning side.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.327
Shouldn't that be
our side, with you?

21:30.372 --> 21:33.660
I mean, you have
a connection.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.167
In her time with us,
the world ended, her mother died,

21:37.213 --> 21:38.544
her father went mad,
burned to death.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.204
I'd say Ofelia's
for herself.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.043
Well, she's standing
by Walker right now.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.673
'Cause she has reason.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.459
He's violent,
he's brutal.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.925
She thinks
he's gonna beat us.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.759
I can't let
my daughter's life be forfeit.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.424
I have to get Alicia
out of there now.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.809
Oh, no, Jake says
they're heavily armed.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.345
- You know? And we can't go demanding.
- This is not a conversation.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.184
We'll just give the parley
a couple days.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.852
Yeah? Is that what you'd do
if you were running things?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.394
No, I don't think so.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.359
You, me, Nick,
a few of your guys,

22:06.408 --> 22:08.319
we slip in,
we bring her back.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.905
Bring the whole tribe
down on our head.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.410
And?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.070
I mean,
don't you want that?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.623
Jake's calling the plays.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.038
You owe me.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.798
I could have brought the whole
ranch down on your head.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.051
Help me do this.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.888
( pigs snorting,
squealing )

22:40.484 --> 22:42.520
( music playing )

23:00.379 --> 23:02.620
( door closes )

23:14.935 --> 23:16.345
I thought, uh...

23:18.230 --> 23:21.438
you and I should
have a chat.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.893
I got nothing
to say to you.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.190
Walker found you.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.983
That's good.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.744
It’s good you're not dead.
- Is it?

23:35.789 --> 23:40.328
If this negotiation works,
it's good.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.585
Didn't have to be me here.
Could be anybody.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.789
What do you want?

23:51.513 --> 23:55.347
I've been thinking
strange thoughts.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.474
Thinking on ghosts
lately.

24:00.648 --> 24:04.061
It's not your own sins
that hold you,

24:04.109 --> 24:07.192
haunting the earth
and wandering in limbo.

24:09.531 --> 24:13.069
It's the crimes
others done to you.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.955
Somehow, they're worse
than the dead.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.211
The ghosts, they...
they carry your sins.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.667
What do you want?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.094
Nobody wants war.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.256
Well, most.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.304
Let's not complicate matters
with old business.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.651
Fair?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.234
Say it's fair.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.868
It's fair.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.505
I'll have someone
bring you in some food.

25:09.550 --> 25:10.881
I'm not hungry.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.541
They'll bring it anyway.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.882
( door closes )

25:20.436 --> 25:22.722
( pigs snorting )

25:29.403 --> 25:31.644
- ( muffled cry)
(pail clatters )

25:33.490 --> 25:36.152
- ( muffled cries )
- (whispering ) Stop, stop.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.066
I'm trying to
rescue you, okay?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.576
Don't scream.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.833
You're gonna get us
all killed.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.499
( muffled groaning )

25:50.549 --> 25:52.255
What are you gonna
do to him?

25:52.301 --> 25:54.087
If you kill him,
I'm not leaving.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.969
Nobody said anything
about killing, okay?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.754
Come on. All right.
Let's go, let's go.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.513
No, you wouldn't
think twice

26:00.559 --> 26:02.550
about slitting his throat
and letting him turn.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.639
I'm about two minutes past
caring what you think

26:04.688 --> 26:06.553
and about ready
to leave you for the pigs.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.355
- ( muffled cries )
- ( grunts )

26:24.917 --> 26:27.909
( dogs barking )
(pigs squealing )

26:27.961 --> 26:30.577
Shit, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.382
What's going on?

26:35.427 --> 26:38.339
Nick: Someone's coming.
They're not gonna make it.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.182
Bring the truck down
and meet them.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.350
( dogs barking )

26:47.773 --> 26:49.058
(whispers )
Go, go, go, go, go.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.191
( groans )

27:08.669 --> 27:11.411
(grunting )

27:17.052 --> 27:19.589
(gunshot)

27:19.638 --> 27:21.970
Man:
Behind the trucks!

27:22.015 --> 27:24.176
They're out
behind the trailers!

27:24.226 --> 27:26.933
- Come on, I got you.
Take them out!

27:26.979 --> 27:29.140
( gunﬁre )

27:29.189 --> 27:31.601
Man #2:
Enemy ﬁre!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.686
- Move it! This way!
(man shouts)

27:35.320 --> 27:37.606
Move away, move away!

27:37.656 --> 27:41.148
- Move it, go, go!
- Go, quick, quick, quick!

27:42.828 --> 27:44.534
Move away!
All the way over!

27:47.040 --> 27:49.326
( men shouting
indistinct/y )

27:49.376 --> 27:51.708
We've gotta move.
Let's go!

27:51.753 --> 27:54.540
( man shouting
indistinctly)

27:54.590 --> 27:55.796
Come on, come on!

28:25.245 --> 28:28.954
Congratulations, you just declared war
on Walker's nation.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.162
Joe, call the patrols!
Watch for perimeter breaches!

28:32.211 --> 28:33.701
They could be
right behind you.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.086
They weren't,
and the mission was successful.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.089
We got the girl.
- I can't believe this was your idea.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.125
- You were in danger.
- Not till Troy showed up

28:41.178 --> 28:42.384
and started killing people!

28:42.429 --> 28:45.341
- How many?
- Eh, four, five.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.346
It wasn't just Troy.
I convinced him.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.644
- I made the call.
- You don't make calls, Madison.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.426
It's not your place
to make the call.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.596
- I made a deal with that guy!
- Against your father's wishes!

28:53.649 --> 28:55.640
- To save all of us!
- He played you!

28:55.692 --> 28:57.398
Walker wasn't gonna
negotiate with you!

28:57.444 --> 28:58.900
You never had anything!

28:58.946 --> 29:01.028
There was nothing at stake
except Alicia's life!

29:03.367 --> 29:06.450
- I told you this was Jake's show.
- It was the right call.

29:06.495 --> 29:10.079
- Troy backed it. He believed.
- And bodies dropped, yeah?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.409
Yes.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.996
A mystery why Troy
backed that call.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.417
Them that don't listen

29:19.466 --> 29:22.253
have to be brought
to heel someday.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.474
( music playing )

29:36.316 --> 29:38.272
( distant chatter )

29:45.909 --> 29:48.366
Does Dad know?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.777
Dad's drunk.

29:55.252 --> 29:59.291
Thought you'd be happy
I brought your girlfriend back.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.797
Tell me, how did
Madison convince you?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.801
It was
for her daughter.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.428
Even you're not stupid enough
to try and pull off what you did.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.306
You set off by yourself
to Walker's camp.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.807
You're doing it again now.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.969
What does your death wish
look like?

30:17.024 --> 30:21.484
See, I think you'd be happy
if Walker took your scalp.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.825
I'm gonna return Ofelia.
I'm gonna reason with him.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.111
I'm gonna placate him
with the water.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.076
While I'm gone, try not to kill
anyone else, all right?

30:35.125 --> 30:37.958
Brother.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.619
You leave, I don't think
you're coming back.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.257
Ask yourself if that
would make you happier.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.180
Alicia: You don't have to leave.
You could stay.

30:56.229 --> 30:59.062
Ofelia: Or you could
come with me.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.598
I wouldn't stay here
if I were you.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.777
VVhy?

31:05.489 --> 31:07.980
What do you know,
Ofelia?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.739
I did you wrong
at the hotel.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.401
I put your life
in danger.

31:12.454 --> 31:15.366
Come with me.
That's all I can offer.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.157
Icantleave.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.952
- You see that.
- Yeah.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.960
I'm sorry about Travis.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.050
( music playing )

31:41.274 --> 31:42.650
Man:
Watch your fire!

31:44.861 --> 31:46.397
There,
they've come back!

31:50.158 --> 31:51.409
(grunting )

31:51.451 --> 31:52.987
Man #2:
Kill him anyway!

32:03.380 --> 32:05.041
Okay, let him breathe.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.966
You broke the parley, Junior,
stole the hostage,

32:10.011 --> 32:11.967
killed my men,
all because I trusted you.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.550
- It was Troy and the girl's mother.
- It's all the same.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.806
I brought you water
and I returned your hostage.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.592
Not good enough.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.977
I promise you...

32:21.022 --> 32:22.478
- Walker: No.
- ( blade rings )

32:22.524 --> 32:24.185
No more promises.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.099
(grunting )

32:26.153 --> 32:28.644
I know I can
still make peace.

32:28.697 --> 32:29.857
I know it.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.950
There will be peace,
but not as you envisioned.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.657
The violence
is almost over.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.000
Taqa.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.885
(grunts)

32:56.016 --> 32:58.553
(gasps )

32:58.602 --> 33:00.558
Tell your father
I'll finish the scalping

33:00.604 --> 33:02.014
of his eldest son
when I see him next.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.056
I will cut apart
his youngest son

33:06.109 --> 33:08.771
and feed him to the hogs.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.028
Tell your father he will
remain alive to watch this.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.490
Before we burn him alive.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.073
( groans )

33:23.126 --> 33:24.366
Safe travels.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.218
( music playing )

33:47.025 --> 33:49.232
Action at the gate.
Action at the gate.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.693
- White flag, hold up.
- Bullshit!

33:55.742 --> 33:57.278
Hold your fire, Coop!

34:00.455 --> 34:01.991
(grunts)

34:02.040 --> 34:04.952
(coughing )

34:09.923 --> 34:11.754
Walker thought
I gave you information

34:11.800 --> 34:15.463
that got you onto the
reservation when you took Alicia.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.049
AS if.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.840
- What?
- I think he means you really didn't

34:20.892 --> 34:24.601
seem to know much about their
camp when we asked.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.932
All I know
is I've lost my home,

34:26.982 --> 34:28.392
lost the people
that took me in

34:28.441 --> 34:29.851
when I was left
to die in the desert.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.439
Madison: You shouldn't
have left us.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.656
Take her
out of here, okay?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.033
Man:
Yes, sir.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.656
Tell Joe to take her
down to the infirmary.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.119
- ( Ofelia groaning )
All right, let's go.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.829
Now we can talk.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.553
So, what do you think?

35:07.606 --> 35:10.188
No, Walker won't sit back
now that we've drawn fresh blood.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.689
His people will press
for an attack.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.566
I can get more info
out of her.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.274
No, she's only in this
situation because of me.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.188
It's my fault.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.402
Back in LA,
I told her father I'd look after her.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.862
I shouldn't have
let her go back.

35:21.911 --> 35:25.153
Well,
she's here now.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.698
So put her to work,
watch her.

35:28.752 --> 35:29.958
She's your charge.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.467
You can stay
with Alicia and me.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.925
We'll have to find
something for you to do.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.636
Worked the kitchen
at Black Hat.

35:45.685 --> 35:49.018
Good, that'll help.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.474
So, am I a prisoner here?

35:50.523 --> 35:52.900
We're all prisoners
somewhere.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.024
You know, there ’s no walls
at Walker’s place.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.311
He says it's 'cause
you can 't sneak up on an Indian.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.400
Oh, well,
they've been lucky.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.150
Madison, Alicia was
never in trouble.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.910
She got a taste of freedom,
and now it's gone.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.331
For the both of us.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.659
Because of me.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.502
( insects chirping )
- ( chatter )

36:14.547 --> 36:17.675
- ( Nick sighs)
- ( chuckles )You saw that, right?

36:17.717 --> 36:21.335
Okay, great, nobody
sleeps for the next 48.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.596
We should take the fight to them,
man, not sit and wait for it.

36:24.641 --> 36:28.133
No fire on the ridgeline.
Indians are holed up.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.926
I'd say offense
is the best defense.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.142
Yeah, well, that's not what
Otto wants right now or Jake.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.440
So, what happens
if Walker attacks

36:36.486 --> 36:37.851
while we're
on the perimeter?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.111
Because it's a long haul
back to the ranch.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.990
Well, there's only
two roads he can use,

36:44.035 --> 36:47.744
and we'll be on both of them
with fast trucks.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.371
We stop him,
we leave a suicide note,

36:50.417 --> 36:52.078
we fall back,
and we defend the camp.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.617
Suicide note?
What?

36:53.670 --> 36:57.333
One of our guys
stays behind to fight to the end?

36:57.382 --> 37:00.044
Well, yeah. Yeah.
We're all willing.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.334
- Amen. No doubt.
- Mm-hmm.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.843
Well, if it does
come to that, I'll do it.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.563
You feeling blue,
Nicky?

37:12.605 --> 37:14.812
No, I'm just suicide-proof.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.519
( laughter)

37:19.070 --> 37:22.153
Well, that's, uh...
that's well and good,

37:22.198 --> 37:26.362
but I think you're gonna
stay within the fence.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.447
You can go kamikaze
another day.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.497
( door closes )

37:37.547 --> 37:39.538
( music playing )

37:48.767 --> 37:51.383
Is what Walker did
at the outpost worse

37:51.436 --> 37:53.768
than what we've done?

37:53.813 --> 37:55.599
Yes. Trust me.

37:57.692 --> 38:01.560
Tore that man's skull off
while he was alive.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.104
Jake wasn't shedding
any tears for McCarthy.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.897
Jake didn't see this.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.533
And I guess the Trimbols...

38:09.579 --> 38:11.695
( knife sharpening )

38:11.748 --> 38:13.454
...that was bad, too.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.617
Yes.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.045
Worse in some ways.

38:20.298 --> 38:24.541
Mom, how can you be so sure it was
Walker who killed the Trimbols?

38:27.931 --> 38:29.387
(gun clicks)

38:38.233 --> 38:40.394
( music playing )

38:40.443 --> 38:42.934
( insects chirping )

38:46.366 --> 38:50.109
( neighs, snorts )

39:03.508 --> 39:05.419
Don't like this.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.631
Do not like it
one damn bit.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.466
You see shit?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.176
If I see shit,

39:12.225 --> 39:14.386
you'll be the first
to know.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.936
Stay frosty.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.648
( groans )

39:26.698 --> 39:28.609
Blake:
Joe, what's up?

39:28.658 --> 39:30.148
Something
ain't right, man.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.487
Ij...
Idon'tfeel r...

39:32.537 --> 39:33.777
( shouting )

39:33.830 --> 39:36.367
Joe, what's going on,
brother?

39:36.416 --> 39:39.032
Joe, Joe, talk to me, man.
What is this?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.201
Joe, what's going on, man?

39:41.254 --> 39:43.290
Jesus,Jesus.
Medic, medic.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.795
( no audio) now,
medic!

39:44.841 --> 39:47.298
Jesus, Jesus, Blake,
what do I do, man?!

39:47.343 --> 39:49.299
- (Joe screaming )
- Blake: Coop! Coop!

39:49.345 --> 39:52.052
- ( Blake screaming )
- Turn on your side. Turn on your side.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.714
( distant screaming )

39:54.767 --> 39:56.723
( music playing )

39:58.730 --> 40:01.096
( screaming continues )

40:01.149 --> 40:02.389
Mom.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.767
( screaming continues )

40:17.040 --> 40:18.530
Coop on radio:
Jimmy, where you at?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.579
Jimmy, it’s Coop, man.
We need you back at the camp.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.039
( raspy breath )

40:28.343 --> 40:31.130
(gurgling growl)

40:36.851 --> 40:38.933
( men shouting over radio )
- Man on radio: We need help over here!

40:38.978 --> 40:41.720
We’re over at the south
side bend, south side bend!

40:41.773 --> 40:43.183
( indistinct shouting )

40:43.232 --> 40:45.018
( distant screams
and gunfire )

40:45.068 --> 40:47.559
Woman:
We need a medic!

40:47.612 --> 40:50.069
- ( people shouting )
- Stay inside! Stay inside!

40:50.114 --> 40:51.524
Go back home!
Get to your homes!

40:51.574 --> 40:53.405
Stay inside!
Go back inside!

40:53.451 --> 40:56.568
Get to your homes.
Get back inside!

40:56.621 --> 40:58.828
- Get back inside!
- ( infected snarling )

41:00.708 --> 41:03.120
( snarling )

41:03.169 --> 41:05.626
( snarling )

41:05.672 --> 41:08.539
(gunshot)

41:08.591 --> 41:11.173
- Jesus, what the hell?
- ( snarling )

41:15.014 --> 41:17.391
Help! Help!

41:17.433 --> 41:19.173
( squelches )

41:24.565 --> 41:26.351
- (gunfire and screaming continue )
- Move.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.362
- Let's go, come on.
( infected snarling )

41:39.080 --> 41:41.241
(grunts)

41:41.290 --> 41:42.700
Nick:
Mom! Mom!

41:44.627 --> 41:45.787
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.748
Where's Alicia?
Alicia, you okay?

41:47.797 --> 41:48.752
Yeah.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.257
Ofelia!

41:53.302 --> 41:54.587
Ofelia!

41:54.637 --> 41:56.969
( shouting and gunﬁre
conﬁnue)

42:02.228 --> 42:03.934
- Shit, stop her.
- Madison: What?

42:03.980 --> 42:05.686
Ofelia, it was her.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.644
- (gasps )
— Nick?

42:08.693 --> 42:11.150
Nick!

42:11.195 --> 42:13.732
(Alicia mutters )
( gasping)

42:13.781 --> 42:15.646
Stay with him.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.157
It's okay,
all right?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.534
(gasping )

42:20.580 --> 42:22.946
( music playing )

42:27.336 --> 42:30.328
( music playing )
