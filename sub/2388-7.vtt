WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:04.922
Guys, I'm going through
something kinda hard.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.090
Since Quinn and I broke up,
she's gone back to dancing

00:07.174 --> 00:10.677
at The Lusty Leopard,
and it's just really tough because...

00:10.761 --> 00:11.762
'Cause you have to find a new strip club?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.597
I have to find a new strip club!

00:13.597 --> 00:16.058
I've been going to The Lusty Leopard
for seven years.

00:16.058 --> 00:19.353
Wow. That's like
49 in perv years.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.355
Sixty-nine. Self-five.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.524
Look... without my open wallet,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.776
The Lusty Leopard
would be nothing.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.070
Thanks to me, they've
been able to expand

00:28.070 --> 00:30.239
and take over that
soup kitchen next door.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.032
Now I'm a free agent,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.409
and all the strip
clubs are after me.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.787
Mr. Stinson, we might not have

00:36.787 --> 00:38.705
the best strippers
at Moneyballs,

00:38.789 --> 00:42.376
but we use sabermetrics to get
you a stripper with a five body,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.837
sure, and another with
a butter face, but together,

00:44.837 --> 00:47.589
with their tireless grinding,
we guarantee

00:47.673 --> 00:50.717
a high on-pants percentage.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.302
I gotta be
honest with you, Fred,

00:52.386 --> 00:55.264
I can't really see myself
signing with the Golden Oldies.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.350
Well, that's what everyone
says... at first.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.352
But our GILFs have got class.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.563
They've got maturity
and experience,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.232
and the kind of mind-blowing
flexibility

01:05.232 --> 01:08.277
that only comes
from advanced hip dysplasia.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.992
Barney, the Lusty Leopard
would be lost without you.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.368
I think you're really
gonna like a couple of the girls

01:16.368 --> 01:18.161
we just pulled up
from the minors.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.038
Don't leave us!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.499
Wow, you're like the
LeBron James of strip clubs.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.335
Actually, you're probably tied
with LeBron James for that title.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.296
LeBron
isn't all that.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.298
The Cavs are doing
great without him.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.757
Yeah!

01:30.841 --> 01:34.344
Hey, guys, you will never
believe who I ran into

01:34.428 --> 01:35.721
outside of work today.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.431
It wasn't the guy
handing out coupons

01:37.431 --> 01:39.266
in the hot dog
costume, was it?

01:39.266 --> 01:42.060
Baby, there's no reason
to be scared of him.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.312
I'm not scared of him.

01:43.312 --> 01:47.774
It's totally normal to see
a hot dog with a face.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.944
No, it was Brad,
my old law school buddy.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.905
I almost didn't recognize him.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.699
Marshall?

01:55.699 --> 01:56.783
Brad?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.912
- Bro!
- Oh, hey!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.205
What a kick-ass day!

02:01.205 --> 02:03.540
I run into you,
some sucker throws away

02:03.624 --> 02:05.918
most of a perfectly good
hot dog...

02:05.918 --> 02:08.337
kick-ass day!

02:08.337 --> 02:09.963
You still doing corporate law?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.965
I got downsized two years ago.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.467
It's been rough.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.344
Going through
a little bit of a depresh.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.971
But just today, boom!

02:18.055 --> 02:20.265
Huge job prospect.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.642
Here's your application.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.185
Just tell them I sent you.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.938
I bet you could fit in
the bratwurst.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.065
Bratwurst with a face.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.525
What'd I tell you?

02:29.525 --> 02:32.110
Looks like I'm about
to be on a roll.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.820
Sounds like that guy
could use some help.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.697
I know!
That's why I said...

02:35.781 --> 02:37.658
You know, I'm...
I'm at Honeywell & Cootes,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.576
and they're looking
to hire an associate.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.370
I could totally recommend you.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.748
Leave the wounded behind!

02:57.761 --> 03:00.681
'Cause Brad is
an old friend who needs a job.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.765
Why shouldn't I give him

03:01.849 --> 03:04.268
the old Marshall Eriksen
Stamp of Approval?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.311
Marshall,
you're a stamp tramp.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.522
How dare you!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.190
And what is that?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.651
You give your stamp of
approval to everything.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.735
It's become meaningless.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.737
It's like when my
mom likes a movie.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.865
It just means Richard
Dreyfuss is in it.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.367
Marshall, you love
everything and everyone.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.910
It's... it's what I love
about you,

03:21.994 --> 03:26.415
but it's also why
your stamps are total crap.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.708
Give me one example.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.877
How about when
you turned your boss

03:29.877 --> 03:32.421
into a fountain
of bodily liquids?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.090
You guys like it?

03:35.174 --> 03:38.343
I'll be waiting for you in hell, Eriksen.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.806
In my defense, that restaurant's
health rating had just gone

03:42.890 --> 03:45.058
from an "F" to a "D,"
and I wanted to reward that.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.186
Marshall, you're
already on thin ice

03:47.186 --> 03:49.313
with that horrible
Honeywell guy.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.773
Don't risk screwing
things up more right before

03:51.857 --> 03:52.941
your biggest case ever.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.693
Okay, Honeywell is not horrible,

03:54.693 --> 03:56.945
he just has a bad temper sometimes.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.906
And he holds a grudge.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.533
He's kind of defensive
about his height.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.076
And he's cheap.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.620
And he made
those secretaries cry.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.121
But, deep down,
he is a great guy.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.623
Heck, he gets my stamp, too.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.999
Stamp tramp.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.709
Well, maybe
this isn't the moment

04:10.709 --> 04:12.211
to stick
your neck out for Brad.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.129
Well, that's not how
I was raised.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.132
Back in St. Cloud,
we believe in people,

04:17.216 --> 04:21.678
people like Gudren Olsen, the
town wino who became our mayor.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.431
They even wound up naming
a bridge after him.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.933
The one he drove off.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.101
Marshall, why can't you be
more like your wife?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.603
Lily's stamp is gold.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.522
I'm reading this book
because of her.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.609
I'm drinking this beer
because she recommended it.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.695
I'm even wearing
this bra because

04:38.779 --> 04:40.447
of a lingerie store
Lily told me about.

04:42.491 --> 04:46.119
Uh, if anyone's got
the golden stamp,

04:46.203 --> 04:48.163
it's old Teddy
Westside over here.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.375
Please. You're a
piggyback stamper.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.335
How dare you!

04:53.335 --> 04:54.711
And what is that?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.964
Allow us to demonstrate.
Lily?

04:56.964 --> 05:00.259
Hey, guys, I just found
a great new sushi restaurant.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.343
It's called Katsu...

05:01.343 --> 05:03.178
...yoku. Katsuyoku.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.972
My idea. I'm Ted.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.850
- Nailed it.
- Totally.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.143
Okay, Ted, name one cool
thing you've given

05:10.227 --> 05:11.603
- your stamp to first...
- Dr. Berkowitz.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.981
...that isn't an ear,
nose and throat doctor.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.694
Man, these strip clubs
want me so bad.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.697
They're sending me T-shirts,
beer cozies.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.699
Sticky's even sent me

05:23.699 --> 05:26.118
a boob-shaped
hand-sanitizer dispenser.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.620
It's clean and dirty
at the same time.

05:28.704 --> 05:32.207
That's it?
T-shirts and beer cozies?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.542
That's disrespect, son!

05:33.542 --> 05:35.002
Here's what you do:

05:35.002 --> 05:38.130
hit a few strip clubs
in Jersey and Long Island.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.382
Jersey? Long Island?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.634
Why would I go to
a Third World nation

05:42.718 --> 05:44.011
to get my knob wobbled?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.179
Well, you wouldn't.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.889
But when the clubs in
the city hear

05:46.889 --> 05:48.724
you're sniffing around
across the river,

05:48.724 --> 05:51.268
those beer cozies
and T-shirts turn

05:51.268 --> 05:53.812
into Rolexes and fur coats.

05:53.896 --> 05:57.274
Especially from that
strip club, Fur Coats.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.068
Wow. That's genius.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.612
You're hired.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.696
What do you mean?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.073
I want you to be
my strip club agent.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.075
What is wrong with you?

06:07.159 --> 06:08.660
Well, I just figured I'd ask...

06:08.744 --> 06:09.912
No, I was talking to myself,

06:09.912 --> 06:11.997
because, for some reason,
I really want to do that!

06:13.874 --> 06:16.543
Oh! Oh!
What am I wearing?

06:16.627 --> 06:19.880
Just proof of a stamp
I know I gave first,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.965
from a little band called...

06:22.049 --> 06:23.383
Dishwalla.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.468
Who?

06:24.468 --> 06:25.928
Dishwalla! Come on!

06:25.928 --> 06:27.012
They had that whole,

06:27.012 --> 06:29.097
<i>Tell Me All Your Thoughts
on God</i> song.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.891
Oh...

06:30.891 --> 06:33.101
Look, I'm not saying
they're my favorite band,

06:33.185 --> 06:34.186
but for a little while
in college,

06:34.186 --> 06:37.231
we were all into that song,
and it was all thanks to me.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.274
But I turned you on
to Dishwalla.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.901
No way! I played them on
my radio show.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.655
I mean, pirate DJ Dr. X
played them on

06:44.655 --> 06:45.948
his beloved radio show.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.824
We all know
you were Dr. X, Ted!

06:47.908 --> 06:50.160
And I'm the one
who got us into that song.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.247
No! No!
On his beloved radio show,

06:53.247 --> 06:55.541
Dr. X pointed out
that the chorus went,

06:55.541 --> 06:57.751
"Tell me all
your thoughts on God"

06:57.835 --> 07:00.796
<i>'Cause I really want
to meet her</i>

07:00.796 --> 07:02.089
Her. God's a woman.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.675
And it blew the minds

07:04.675 --> 07:06.301
of everyone listening
to Dr. X that night.

07:06.385 --> 07:10.013
Which was pretty much everyone
on campus... including me.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.348
I'm not Dr. X.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.891
Oh, so you're saying

07:12.975 --> 07:16.395
credit for the stamp goes
to Dr. X then, not you.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.570
Okay. I'm gonna tell you guys
something right now.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.822
Take a sip.
Follow my lead.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.494
I'm Dr. X.

07:32.578 --> 07:35.247
No!

07:35.247 --> 07:36.874
I hope this
works out, bro.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.959
I couldn't even get my leg
in that bratwurst outfit.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.379
Don't be nervous.
Honeywell is gonna love you.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.715
Sweet! Freebie
muff-tops!

07:47.050 --> 07:49.595
Can I pour you
a pocket of coffee?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.430
I didn't say
you were fat.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.266
I said that dress makes
you look fat! Idiot!

07:54.266 --> 07:56.185
Hey! You must be Brad!

07:56.185 --> 07:57.269
I'm excited to meet the man

07:57.269 --> 08:00.105
Eriksen's been talking up
all week.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.441
Mr. Honeywell, I have to say,

08:02.441 --> 08:04.693
your environmental work is amazing.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.279
Come on, it's not like
I'm saving the world.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.198
Oh, wait, yes, I am!

08:09.198 --> 08:11.241
Great.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.326
Marshall tells me you have

08:12.326 --> 08:14.703
the big Gruber Pharmaceutical
trial coming up.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.330
I'd love to give you my
thoughts on the case,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.749
but I can't take full credit.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.584
Most of these are
from my psychic.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.086
My psychic always
pushes for a settlement.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.048
But my numerologist says
roll the dice with the jury.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.175
I'm waiting for my
astrologist to weigh in,

08:28.175 --> 08:29.968
but he can be
kind of flaky.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.179
You know, Cancer.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.057
Should know more after
he's back from chemo.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.351
Good luck, bro!

08:43.482 --> 08:46.235
You know the best part about you
challenging me on Dishwalla?

08:46.235 --> 08:48.028
Didn't challenge you, don't care.
It made me

08:48.028 --> 08:50.447
dig up my old video diaries
from freshman year.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.449
And somewhere in here
there's gonna be proof

08:52.533 --> 08:54.034
that I am not a
piggyback stamper.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.078
I have my own
original ideas.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.871
Didn't you only do
the video diaries

08:57.955 --> 08:59.790
because of Winona Ryder
in <i>Reality Bites?</i>

08:59.790 --> 09:00.999
No.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.836
I don't know what
you're talk... shut up.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.587
Let's just watch.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.339
How do you even know there's
gonna be mention

09:07.339 --> 09:09.466
- of Dishwalla on those tapes?
- I don't.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.385
And it may take me days
to go through them all,

09:11.385 --> 09:14.763
but that is how committed
I am to the truth.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.267
Hey, you guys should check out
that song by the band Dishwalla.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.185
Really?
I've never heard of them.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.437
Damn it!

09:22.521 --> 09:23.522
So?

09:23.522 --> 09:26.441
Bottom line, Vito:
a lot of strip clubs are into my client.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.318
If you want the Melon Patch
to be in the mix,

09:28.402 --> 09:30.654
we're gonna need bigger melons
and smaller patches.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.364
Otherwise, your establishment
is not where

09:32.364 --> 09:34.241
Barney Stinson
is gonna pitch his tent.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.493
B-Dawg, Barn Door,

09:36.577 --> 09:37.995
Stinson-natti, Bro-hio!

09:37.995 --> 09:40.497
Talk to me.
How's it hangin'?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.457
You are killing it
at this agent thing!

09:42.541 --> 09:45.502
I just got a big box
at Yankee Stadium

09:45.586 --> 09:47.045
from the ladies at The Big Box.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.756
- Mm-hmm.
- One question: Golden Oldies

09:49.840 --> 09:52.551
just sent me a fax machine
and a Charo calendar.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.344
Mm-hmm.
- Aren't they out of the running?

09:54.428 --> 09:56.722
Yeah, but those old bitches
don't need to know that.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.891
Yeah, I just feel kind of bad.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.142
They just spent eight grand...

10:00.142 --> 10:02.227
...on that wheelchair ramp
up to the stage.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.897
Hey, Larry, how's everything
at the Beaver Dam?

10:04.897 --> 10:06.648
I don't even know
that strip club.

10:06.732 --> 10:07.733
Oh, it's not a club.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.694
Um, my cousin Larry is
a forest ranger in Squamish.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.738
Oh, yeah?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.031
Then I was fired from

10:14.031 --> 10:15.115
Bed Bath & Beyond

10:15.199 --> 10:16.909
for telling
inappropriate jokes.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.786
I mean...
get a sense of humor, LaShonda.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.122
You know how "they" are.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.625
"They" meaning Bed Bath
& Beyond employees, right?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.878
- Hmm?
- No. Women.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.421
That still could have
been worse.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.381
Thank God I ran
into Marshall.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.717
This guy's supportive
as balls.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.801
And here I am.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.930
Yes, we both owe Marshall
a debt of gratitude

10:37.930 --> 10:39.264
for getting you
this interview.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.349
Eriksen...

10:40.349 --> 10:43.101
- can I see you outside?
- Sure.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.145
Good. Try to stay
out there a few minutes.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.941
I just cut one, and I can
tell it's gonna be a slow burn.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.404
What is Generation X?

10:54.488 --> 10:57.199
What does the X in
"Generation X" stand for?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.243
What do we stand for?

10:59.243 --> 11:02.037
Why aren't people on campus
talking about this?

11:02.037 --> 11:04.039
Maybe you should do
a radio show

11:04.039 --> 11:06.375
and call yourself Dr. X.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.754
I just had an amazing idea.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.967
Just turn it off!

11:14.967 --> 11:16.510
I can't look away.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.387
Oh, God, no.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.639
Oh, God, I'm putting on a beret.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.723
You were there.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.892
Why didn't you tell me
that looked stupid?

11:23.976 --> 11:26.728
Ted, that beret looks stupid.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.189
I look <i>magnifique!</i>

11:29.273 --> 11:31.608
Marshall, that man is the human
equivalent of what came out

11:31.692 --> 11:33.735
of my body after eating
that soup you recommended!

11:33.819 --> 11:34.903
This guy's your friend?

11:34.987 --> 11:37.906
Really more of an
acquaintance than a friend.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.492
No backpedaling.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.119
You're Marshall Eriksen.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.663
You believe in people.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.206
You know what Brad
hasn't told you?

11:46.290 --> 11:48.208
He was third in our
class at Columbia.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.751
That is impressive.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.462
And I suppose he did warn us
about the fart.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.047
He's a great guy.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.717
Please... give him
just one more chance.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.511
Two more minutes.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.432
I'm proud of you.

12:03.432 --> 12:06.143
I'm proud of you for
being proud of me.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.274
You went undergrad
to Holy Cross?

12:12.274 --> 12:13.400
That's my alma mater.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.152
I went there on a basketball scholarship.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.945
No way. I played center.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.739
Uh-oh.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.157
Why is that so shocking?

12:20.157 --> 12:23.660
'Cause you're, like,
an itty-bitty fella.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.495
Hey, uh, fish, huh?

12:25.579 --> 12:26.580
Fish are crazy, right?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.664
You guys ever think
about fish?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.042
I am six-foot one, sir.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.544
Bro, I'm at least
a foot taller than you.

12:32.628 --> 12:36.048
Well, then I guess that makes
you a freakish seven-foot one.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.383
What do you call fish
with no eyes?

12:38.467 --> 12:39.843
"Fsh."

12:39.927 --> 12:43.639
I am six-feet and one inch,
and I'll prove it.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.098
Eriksen.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.064
How tall are you?

12:52.064 --> 12:54.983
Seven feet.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.236
So, we've got
a deal somewhere?

12:57.236 --> 12:58.362
We sure do.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.656
You are the new face of

13:00.656 --> 13:03.659
and exclusive customer to...

13:04.785 --> 13:05.994
Golden Oldies!

13:06.078 --> 13:07.788
What?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.331
I thought we ruled them out!

13:09.331 --> 13:10.874
I don't remember that!

13:10.958 --> 13:13.126
Now, uh, let's go. It is 4:00,

13:13.210 --> 13:15.212
and their dinner show starts
in ten minutes.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.422
Wait a minute.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.883
- Oh...
- Is that a Rolex?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.385
Huh. What do you know?

13:21.385 --> 13:22.511
How did that get there?

13:22.511 --> 13:26.014
Anyway, uh,
so initial here and...

13:27.057 --> 13:28.684
Where'd you get
the bling, Robin?

13:28.684 --> 13:30.310
Uh...

13:30.394 --> 13:32.229
They bribed you.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.481
They bribed you!

13:34.565 --> 13:37.276
Why else would you pick a place
where the strippers say

13:37.276 --> 13:39.570
they're trying to put their
grandkids through college?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.071
Please leave!

13:41.071 --> 13:45.075
- Barney, I can explain, okay?
- Please...

13:45.075 --> 13:47.578
leave.

13:47.578 --> 13:50.414
Say it, you giant beast!
Say I'm six-one!

13:50.414 --> 13:52.082
Maybe if you stood on top
of that pot of gold

13:52.082 --> 13:54.251
you have at the end
of your rainbow.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.502
You know something?

13:55.586 --> 13:57.254
You're nothing but a...

13:57.254 --> 13:58.630
a tree man!

13:58.714 --> 14:01.341
I never want to
see you again, tree man!

14:01.425 --> 14:02.759
Fine.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.428
I have to go to the
little boys' room.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.305
Not your office.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.098
I need to take a dump.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.810
If that's the type of guy
you vouch for,

14:11.894 --> 14:13.270
I can't trust your judgment.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.938
You're off the Gruber
Pharmaceutical case.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.440
No...

14:21.945 --> 14:25.449
Oh, good, we're up to the
time I got my ear pierced.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.658
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.327
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't, don't.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.621
Okay, do it now.
Do, do, do it, do it.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.207
Don't, don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!

14:33.207 --> 14:36.835
Don't! Yes, you can do this.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.837
That goes on for 45 minutes.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.759
Hey... how was work, baby?

14:45.302 --> 14:47.262
Remember how
I always wanted to know

14:47.346 --> 14:49.515
what it was like to be a ghost?

14:49.515 --> 14:51.725
Well, I don't want that anymore.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.477
Okay, suppose we lead

14:53.477 --> 14:55.646
with the carbon testing
of the residue water.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.565
How do we keep
the jury engaged? Anyone?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.152
You could bring up
the survey from

15:02.236 --> 15:04.863
Dr. Pasquesi's testimony.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.490
Anyone?

15:06.490 --> 15:09.451
Anyone who isn't dead to me?

15:09.535 --> 15:12.037
Then you have to earn
Honeywell's trust back.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.705
Just start small.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.082
Put your stamp on little things

15:15.082 --> 15:16.625
that have nothing
to do with work.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.835
Like a funny video.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.838
I, uh, I may have something.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.759
Don't think, Mosby! Do it now!
Oh, my God, I'm doing it!

15:25.843 --> 15:27.970
Wow, he's a real bleeder!

15:29.054 --> 15:32.182
<i>And then you build to something
else small, like a tasty snack.</i>

15:32.266 --> 15:34.726
Don't sleep on the popcorn.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.271
Try mixing the caramel
and the cheese.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.397
It shouldn't work,

15:38.397 --> 15:40.399
but... it... does.

15:40.399 --> 15:44.111
There's no way caramel
and cheese... that's good!

15:44.111 --> 15:45.988
That is good. Oh!

15:45.988 --> 15:48.407
<i>And when Honeywell starts
trusting your stamp again,</i>

15:48.407 --> 15:50.909
<i>he'll seek out
your opinion on things.</i>

15:50.993 --> 15:51.994
Be honest, Eriksen.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.871
Is this deep-V working?

15:53.871 --> 15:56.290
<i>And that's when
you lie your ass off.</i>

15:56.290 --> 15:57.666
Sir...

15:57.666 --> 15:59.918
I think you could
go even deeper.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.131
<i>And before you know it...</i>

16:04.131 --> 16:05.674
Eriksen, get in here.

16:05.674 --> 16:06.800
<i>...you're back on the case.</i>

16:06.884 --> 16:08.510
I want you

16:10.095 --> 16:13.265
Ted, why are you
torturing yourself?

16:13.265 --> 16:15.851
None of us were
our best in college.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.437
Oh, my God, I love
my hair there!

16:19.605 --> 16:23.025
I always thought I was this kid
from suburban Ohio

16:23.025 --> 16:26.153
who had this innate sense
of judgment and taste

16:26.153 --> 16:29.615
and just showed up to college
and wowed everyone.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.451
Now I have concrete proof
that I wasn't.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.078
I was a total gomer.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.622
Maybe I still am.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.916
Wait, that's
the giant suit

16:38.916 --> 16:41.335
Marshall wore on
our third date.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.419
<i>So...</i>

16:42.503 --> 16:44.171
Marshall Eriksen,

16:44.171 --> 16:47.049
you just came back from
your third date with Lily.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.509
How was it?

16:48.509 --> 16:49.760
Great, yeah.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.598
I just... I think I'm falling
for this girl pretty hard.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.476
But is everything
happening too fast?

16:57.476 --> 16:59.144
I mean, maybe I should
see other people.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.188
Whoa, dude, no!

17:01.188 --> 17:03.941
Lily Aldrin is special.
You hold on to that girl.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.484
She is.

17:05.484 --> 17:06.818
I'm only 18 and...

17:06.902 --> 17:09.571
Marshall, you being 18
isn't a bad thing.

17:09.655 --> 17:12.741
It just means you get to spend
even more of your life with her.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.743
I mean, I'm probably
not gonna meet my wife

17:14.743 --> 17:17.204
until I'm, like, 23.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.874
You're right.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.502
What am I thinking?

17:23.502 --> 17:25.796
I'm in love
with this girl.

17:25.796 --> 17:28.966
Ted, oh, my God.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.677
You gave me
the ultimate stamp.

17:31.677 --> 17:36.807
And in my whole life,
this life...

17:36.807 --> 17:39.351
it all goes back to that moment.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.272
<i>I mean, maybe take a month off,</i>

17:43.272 --> 17:44.481
<i>bang a couple chicks.</i>

17:44.565 --> 17:45.941
<i>Lily's not going anywhere.</i>

17:49.528 --> 17:51.071
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.575
Um, look, I'm sorry about the
whole skimming-off-the-top-

17:54.575 --> 17:56.743
of-the-strip-club-swag thing.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.662
Hey, it happens to everybody.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.831
Really? Because even
as I said those words,

18:00.831 --> 18:03.500
they did not feel
like a real thing.

18:03.584 --> 18:06.295
Hey, look, wherever you end up,
can I have the dubious honor

18:06.295 --> 18:08.130
of buying you
your first lap dance?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.007
It's a date.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.552
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for "The Decision."

18:16.555 --> 18:18.223
Yeah.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.601
Ladies, my bro-dium?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.062
Yeah.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.647
Look at this!

18:25.731 --> 18:28.901
Man, this whole
free agent experience,

18:28.901 --> 18:31.361
it's been an unbelievable experience,

18:31.445 --> 18:33.906
a real humbling experience.

18:33.906 --> 18:37.784
First of all, The Lusty Leopard
is where I developed my game.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.119
Oh...

18:39.203 --> 18:42.706
I have nothing
but the utmost respect for you skanks.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.208
He's just gonna stay
at The Lusty Leopard.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.001
They have loyalty
and heart.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.419
I bet you
he rewards that.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.796
LeBron moved on, Ted.
So should you.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.051
But Barney Stinson has
to do what's right

18:54.051 --> 18:56.053
for Barney Stinson's penis.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.140
In this fall... this is tough.

19:00.224 --> 19:03.560
Um... in this fall I'm going

19:03.644 --> 19:06.355
to take my talents
to Mouth Beach.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.404
<i>The next day,
Uncle Marshall went to court</i>

19:14.488 --> 19:16.615
<i>for the biggest case
of his life.</i>

19:16.615 --> 19:19.660
Hey, Marshall!
Bilbo!

19:19.660 --> 19:22.120
Brad? What are you...

19:22.204 --> 19:23.330
Did you just get hired

19:23.330 --> 19:25.415
by Gruber Pharmaceutical's
legal team?

19:25.499 --> 19:27.376
Oh, not just.

19:27.376 --> 19:29.545
I've been working
for them for two years.

19:29.545 --> 19:32.714
<i>I heard about the job opening
at Honeywell & Cootes</i>

19:32.798 --> 19:35.092
<i>and knew that if I hung out
in front of your office</i>

19:35.092 --> 19:38.804
<i>and pretended to be down on
my luck, you'd take pity on me,</i>

19:38.804 --> 19:40.097
<i>get me an interview...</i>

19:40.097 --> 19:41.515
Try to stay out there
a few minutes.

19:41.515 --> 19:46.186
I just cut one, and I can tell
it's gonna be a slow burn.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.439
<i>...and buy some alone time
in the conference room.</i>

19:54.611 --> 19:56.822
I got your firm's strategy
for the case.

19:56.822 --> 19:59.658
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> bro-migo.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.496
He's really more of an
acquaintance than a bro-migo.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.623
Win this case
or you're fired, Eriksen.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.460
<i>And so began the trial
that would change the course</i>

20:10.544 --> 20:12.129
<i>of Marshall's career.</i>

20:12.129 --> 20:13.630
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

20:13.714 --> 20:17.801
Oh, you see? This is what
I miss about being single:

20:17.885 --> 20:19.845
cutting loose
at a strip club,

20:19.845 --> 20:22.598
drinkin' some beers,
seein' some boobs,

20:22.598 --> 20:25.142
getting thrown out
for being "too handsy."

20:25.142 --> 20:27.519
You were a little
out of control tonight.

20:27.603 --> 20:28.979
You know,
I really thought

20:28.979 --> 20:31.982
that that bouncer was bluffing
with the Taser.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.066
Man, everything's gonna taste

20:33.150 --> 20:35.485
like pennies for a week.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.321
I had a fun time
tonight, though.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.031
Me, too.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.240
I always have fun with you.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.209
Whoa, whoa.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.462
I... I've got to... um...

20:55.130 --> 20:56.965
we can't... we can't do this.

20:58.175 --> 21:01.094
This... this can't happen.

21:01.178 --> 21:05.474
- Uh, I've got to go.
- What...
