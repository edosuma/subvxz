WEBVTT

00:03.221 --> 00:06.290
Agent Sterling Archer,
codename Duchess.

00:06.358 --> 00:07.890
Licensed to kill.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.794
Primary skills: covert operations.

00:10.862 --> 00:12.028
Unarmed combat.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.062
Firearms.

00:13.131 --> 00:14.130
Explosives.

00:14.199 --> 00:15.764
Asset acquisition.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.533
Enemy agent disposal.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.968
Current status: missing.

00:20.037 --> 00:21.571
MALORY: For three months!

00:21.640 --> 00:26.012
Sterling's been missing for three
months and you idiots have nothing!

00:26.080 --> 00:32.021
GILLETTE: Well name-calling's
not gonna get us -- [ BLEEP ]

00:32.089 --> 00:32.723
Anywhere.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.224
LANA: Which is where
Archer could be.

00:34.293 --> 00:36.627
Malory, we've checked every safe
house, run down every lead...

00:36.695 --> 00:41.432
CYRIL: And he hasn't touched any of his
bank accounts, so unless he... oh.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.735
LANA: Were you gonna say
"unless he's been skimming

00:43.804 --> 00:46.271
tons of cash from his operations
accounts all these years"?

00:46.341 --> 00:47.640
CYRIL: Yeah, duh, right?

00:47.709 --> 00:49.609
MALORY: Wh-?
He wouldn't dare steal from me!

00:49.677 --> 00:54.213
GILLETTE: Oh please, we all --
think he would dare to do that.

00:54.282 --> 00:57.216
LANA: So we've got a g highly-ih
skilled covert agent,

00:57.284 --> 01:00.018
who probably has millions
of dollars in cash...

01:00.087 --> 01:01.821
GILLETTE: Who doesn't
want to be found.

01:01.890 --> 01:04.492
MALORY: Being looked for by people
who don't want to find him!

01:04.561 --> 01:06.027
EVERYBODY: What does that mean?

01:06.096 --> 01:07.061
MALORY: Oh, don't give me that!

01:07.130 --> 01:09.131
You're all secretly
delighted that he's gone!

01:09.200 --> 01:13.103
LANA: I wouldn't say delighted, but...
GILLETTE: I cannot say I miss

01:13.172 --> 01:13.938
the bullying.

01:14.007 --> 01:14.639
CYRIL: Me neither.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.842
Plus ISIS actually turned
a profit this quarter.

01:16.911 --> 01:20.079
MALORY: Be that as it -- no, never mind!

01:20.148 --> 01:23.184
Because since you've all been
half-assedly phoning it in --

01:23.253 --> 01:24.519
LANA: Malory, he can't!

01:24.588 --> 01:25.086
Be found!

01:25.155 --> 01:29.459
I mean, if he's even still...um...
MALORY: Still what.

01:29.528 --> 01:31.095
CHERYL/CAROL: Aliiive.

01:31.163 --> 01:33.064
Jeezow, talk about duh.

01:33.133 --> 01:36.035
I bet he totally already
killed himself.

01:36.103 --> 01:37.103
PAM: No he didn't!

01:37.171 --> 01:38.104
What's wrong with you?!

01:38.173 --> 01:39.105
CHERYL/CAROL: Nothing!

01:39.174 --> 01:41.875
Because my skeevy Russian fiancée
wasn't murdered in front

01:41.944 --> 01:44.112
of my very eyeballs
at my stupid wedding!

01:44.181 --> 01:46.882
ARCHER: Noooooooooooooooooooo!

01:46.951 --> 01:48.216
Kaaatyaaa!

01:48.285 --> 01:50.553
Noooo ho ho wah ha haaa!

01:50.622 --> 01:51.354
BARRY: Woooooh!

01:51.423 --> 01:52.188
How's it feel, Archer?!

01:52.257 --> 01:54.124
Now both our weddings
are canceled!

01:54.192 --> 01:57.127
ARCHER: Baarryyyyyyy!

01:57.195 --> 01:58.895
BARRY: Is that how
you crash a wedding?

01:58.964 --> 02:03.099
Yes it is, Bionic Barry, yes it is...
MALORY: No!

02:03.168 --> 02:07.071
No matter how distraught Sterling is
over Katya, he won't kill himself.

02:07.139 --> 02:08.238
He'd never do that to me.

02:08.306 --> 02:10.975
He's alive, somewhere, and
since you fools can't find

02:11.043 --> 02:13.577
him I called in someone who can.

02:13.646 --> 02:16.680
Say hello to Rip Riley, manhunter.

02:16.749 --> 02:17.681
RILEY: Manhunter?

02:17.750 --> 02:21.218
- Now if that is the pot calling
the kettle black... MALORY: Oh Rip,

02:21.287 --> 02:23.121
you old so-and-so!

02:23.189 --> 02:24.122
RILEY: How are you, Malory?

02:24.190 --> 02:24.923
Besides gorgeous?

02:24.992 --> 02:26.591
MALORY: Oh I'm not, I'm a mess!

02:26.660 --> 02:29.929
I'm worried half to death about Sterling, and --
RILEY: Well, don't be.

02:29.997 --> 02:30.897
I tracked him down.

02:30.966 --> 02:31.798
MALORY: Already?!

02:31.867 --> 02:32.365
LANA: Wh-? How?!

02:32.434 --> 02:34.601
RILEY: Uh, this new thing
called intelligence gathering?

02:34.670 --> 02:38.172
Anyhoo, he's on a little island
called Wapuni in French Polynesia --

02:38.240 --> 02:40.908
GILLETTE: With his millions in caaaash...
RILEY: Tending bar.

02:40.977 --> 02:41.843
GILLETTE: Or nooooot.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.546
RILEY: So I'll pick him up tonight,
then say, three days back to New York,

02:44.614 --> 02:48.116
so if you're not busy Friday night...
MALORY: I'll book us our old

02:48.184 --> 02:49.183
booth at 21.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.451
RILEY: Outstanding.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.185
Riley out.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.387
PAM: What a hunk!

02:52.455 --> 02:54.389
CHERYL/CAROL: Total sploosh.

02:54.457 --> 02:57.559
LANA: Actually yeah, gotta
give him the sploosh.

02:57.627 --> 03:00.195
GILLETTE: And, whatever my
equivalent of sploosh is,

03:00.263 --> 03:03.466
which, I guess is just sploosh.

03:03.534 --> 03:05.568
Only with semen.

03:41.706 --> 03:45.410
WOMAN: Oh my God, I can't
believe I just did that...

03:45.478 --> 03:48.598
You know, I'm not like that --
ARCHER: No, hey c'mon, don't do that...

03:48.718 --> 03:51.852
Don't ruin your post-coital bliss
with a bunch of misplaced guilt.

03:51.921 --> 03:55.390
WOMAN: How is it misplaced,
I'm on my honeymoo-hooon!

03:55.458 --> 03:56.742
ARCHER: Well at least
you got a honeymoon!

03:56.862 --> 03:58.126
My fiancée was murdered!

03:58.195 --> 03:59.528
WOMAN: Wait, what?
ARCHER: Yeah!

03:59.597 --> 04:01.163
Oh! And you married an idiot!

04:01.232 --> 04:04.266
Who plays thirty-six holes of golf
on the first day of his honeymoon?

04:04.335 --> 04:07.602
Because not to, whatever, but that
cannot bode well for your marriage.

04:07.671 --> 04:10.171
WOMAN: Get the hell out,
you piece of shit!

04:10.240 --> 04:14.008
ARCHER: Seriously, I hope she didn't
sign a pre-nup, because -- Oh my God!

04:14.077 --> 04:17.011
Hey so, what happened was,
somebody ordered room service,

04:17.079 --> 04:19.913
but the regular room service
guy, uh, he died, so I came in

04:19.981 --> 04:23.716
here and fell on the bed --
Wait, you're not her husband.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.520
And you're not one of my dick
bosses, so can I help you, or...?

04:26.588 --> 04:28.789
RILEY: Yes, you can quickly and
quietly walk down to the dock

04:28.857 --> 04:30.190
and board my seaplane.

04:30.259 --> 04:33.494
ARCHER: Okay A, rhetorical,
and B, your what?

04:33.563 --> 04:34.195
RILEY: Seaplane?

04:34.264 --> 04:36.631
Looks like an airplane
had a baby with a boat?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.433
ARCHER: I know what a
seaplane is, idiot!

04:38.502 --> 04:40.235
RILEY: And yet you're
surprisingly unclear on the

04:40.304 --> 04:41.637
phrase "quickly and quietly."

04:41.706 --> 04:44.039
ARCHER: And even more
unclear on who you are?

04:44.108 --> 04:45.107
RILEY: Name's Rip Riley.

04:45.176 --> 04:47.342
Your mother hired me to
bring you back, Sterling.

04:47.411 --> 04:48.210
ARCHER: She what?!

04:48.279 --> 04:48.944
I mean who?!

04:49.013 --> 04:50.646
I'm Randy! See?

04:50.715 --> 04:54.083
So you can just go back to...
that other guy's mother and tell

04:54.152 --> 04:56.185
her that even if you did
find that other guy,

04:56.254 --> 04:59.255
he's never coming back to ISIS!

04:59.323 --> 05:00.956
Wait, did you say ISIS, or...?

05:01.025 --> 05:03.225
How did ISIS suddenly get in
the mix, is what I'm asking.

05:03.294 --> 05:05.161
RILEY: And I'm asking you, for
the second and last time,

05:05.229 --> 05:05.961
to get on that plane.

05:06.030 --> 05:07.329
ARCHER: Ya wanna try and make me?

05:07.398 --> 05:08.230
RILEY: No, I don't.

05:08.299 --> 05:15.872
And I promise -- you
don't want that either.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.909
ARCHER: Hey, so listen...
I think we got off on the wrong foot?

05:19.978 --> 05:24.013
But I'm willing to, ya know, let
bygones be gone by the wayside...

05:24.082 --> 05:26.282
RILEY: Good to know...
But I'm there yet.

05:26.350 --> 05:27.783
ARCHER: Well, give it some time.

05:27.852 --> 05:29.852
Speaking of, how long
is this stupid flight?

05:29.921 --> 05:32.688
RILEY: Eh, about forty hours in the air...
ARCHER: Hooray...

05:32.757 --> 05:34.657
RILEY: But I have to
island-hop to re-fuel.

05:34.726 --> 05:38.594
Old Lucy Goosey here only has a range
of about a thousand nautical miles.

05:38.663 --> 05:40.930
ARCHER: Making it wildly
impractical, got it.

05:40.998 --> 05:42.698
RILEY: This plane is
totally practical!

05:42.767 --> 05:44.466
ARCHER: Maybe for this
ridiculous image you're trying

05:44.535 --> 05:46.435
to cultivate for yourself...
RILEY: What image?

05:46.504 --> 05:48.303
ARCHER: Sky Captain
of Yesteryeeear!

05:48.339 --> 05:51.340
RILEY: At least I'm not sky
captain of I ran away from home,

05:51.409 --> 05:53.008
ARCHER: I didn't run
away from home!

05:53.077 --> 05:53.608
I'm a grown man!

05:53.677 --> 05:56.278
Whose fiancée was murdered
in front of his very eyes!

05:56.346 --> 05:58.880
So excuse me for needing
some time to grieve!

05:58.949 --> 06:00.715
RILEY: By tending bar
and banging newlyweds?

06:00.784 --> 06:04.185
ARCHER: Apparently that's
my grieving process!

06:04.254 --> 06:05.519
And also I need to
use the bathroom!

06:05.588 --> 06:06.720
RILEY: A, it's called the head.

06:06.789 --> 06:07.955
And B, no.

06:08.024 --> 06:08.955
Pee in your pants.

06:09.024 --> 06:10.724
ARCHER: Yeah, wrong number.

06:10.792 --> 06:13.859
And I've literally had nothing but
liquor and mangoes for three months,

06:13.928 --> 06:17.696
so unless you wanna fly a thousand
nautical miles sitting next to that...

06:17.765 --> 06:19.297
RILEY: Okay, I'm setting
the auto-pilot.

06:19.366 --> 06:21.199
But this better not be a ruse.

06:21.268 --> 06:22.167
ARCHER: A ruse?

06:22.235 --> 06:23.301
Brrring! Brrring!

06:23.370 --> 06:23.902
Hello?

06:23.970 --> 06:26.971
Hi, it's the 1930's, can we have our
words and clothes and shitty airplane

06:27.040 --> 06:27.305
back?

06:27.374 --> 06:28.039
RILEY: Let's go, kid.

06:28.108 --> 06:29.174
ARCH: Call ya back, 1930's!

06:29.242 --> 06:31.209
And hey, watch out for
that Adolf Hitler!

06:31.278 --> 06:32.010
He's a bad egg!

06:32.079 --> 06:35.080
RILEY: No, one pedal fills it with water -- 
ARCHER: I did that!

06:35.148 --> 06:36.815
RILEY: And the other
pedal flushes it!

06:36.884 --> 06:38.150
ARCHER: No, it doesn't!

06:38.218 --> 06:42.187
Ugh, you come try, I gotta
choke down this gag reflex.

06:42.256 --> 06:42.655
Yeah, ha ha!

06:42.724 --> 06:45.224
Quit being a dick for five
seconds and unlock the door!

06:45.293 --> 06:46.393
RILEY: It doesn't have a lock!

06:46.461 --> 06:48.328
ARCHER: Dammit, I'm gonna
puke and there's no room

06:48.397 --> 06:49.363
in the toilet or the sink!

06:49.431 --> 06:52.499
RILEY: What the hell'd
you put in the sink?!

06:52.568 --> 06:53.434
ARCHER: A ruse!

06:53.503 --> 06:55.336
You big dumb idiot.

06:55.405 --> 06:58.106
And also a bunch of shaving
cream and toilet paper.

06:58.175 --> 06:59.641
Just because.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.077
LANA: And where does Malory get
off implying we didn't try our

07:02.146 --> 07:02.778
best to find Archer?

07:02.847 --> 07:04.346
GILLETTE: No, she
straight up said it.

07:04.415 --> 07:07.048
What she implied was that
we're jealous of Archer,

07:07.117 --> 07:09.617
and that you hate yourself cause
you're still attracted to him.

07:09.686 --> 07:10.918
LANA: I -- that's -- what?!

07:10.987 --> 07:12.619
PAM: Oh please, you're
so hot for him I could

07:12.688 --> 07:14.922
re-heat this chili in yer cooch.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.858
LANA: Don't you have some...
humans to resource?!

07:17.926 --> 07:19.025
PAM: Actually, no.

07:19.094 --> 07:20.927
Most of my job's dealing
with sexual harrassment

07:20.996 --> 07:25.431
complaints against Mr. Archer, so...
are we gonna some cooch chili

07:25.500 --> 07:28.368
or what?

07:28.436 --> 07:32.372
RILEY: Wuzza... wuzz...
What in the holy hell are you doing?

07:32.441 --> 07:33.974
ARCHER: Well it was gonna
be an Old Fashioned,

07:34.042 --> 07:36.877
but I couldn't find any bitters, so --
RILEY: How long was I out?!

07:36.946 --> 07:37.477
ARCHER: Hard to say.

07:37.546 --> 07:40.113
After I shaved and stuff I
took a pretty long nap, so --

07:40.182 --> 07:41.314
RILEY: Uncuff me, you idiot!

07:41.383 --> 07:44.384
Holy God, if we overshot
our chance to refuel...!

07:44.452 --> 07:46.119
ARCHER: I thought you
put it on auto-pilot!

07:46.188 --> 07:48.387
RILEY: It just maintains
course and altitude!

07:48.456 --> 07:51.824
It doesn't know how to find the
only airstrip within a thousand

07:51.892 --> 07:55.460
miles so it can land
itself when it needs gas!

07:55.529 --> 07:58.396
ARCHER: Well, then I
misunderstood the concept.

07:58.464 --> 07:59.397
RILEY: Uncuff me!

07:59.465 --> 08:00.231
ARCHER: Okay, God!

08:00.300 --> 08:02.433
Wait, first promise you
won't take me back to ISIS!

08:02.501 --> 08:03.167
RILEY: ISIS?!

08:03.235 --> 08:06.036
You'll be lucky if I can
get us back to land!

08:06.105 --> 08:07.138
Now uncuff me!

08:07.206 --> 08:08.373
ARCHER: Okay, God!

08:08.442 --> 08:09.007
Wait a minute.

08:09.076 --> 08:12.777
Is this a ruse?

08:12.846 --> 08:14.195
ARCHER: Because if it is?

08:14.315 --> 08:16.415
Pretty elaborate.

08:19.454 --> 08:19.883
RILEY: Dammit!

08:20.003 --> 08:20.931
There goes number two!

08:20.995 --> 08:22.340
ARCHER: But it can land
on water, right?!

08:22.372 --> 08:23.696
I mean, isn't that
the whole point?!

08:23.786 --> 08:24.986
RILEY: It's a kinda
different story when we're

08:25.054 --> 08:27.688
dropping like a ton of bricks!

08:27.757 --> 08:29.424
Damn, I can barely hold her level!

08:29.492 --> 08:30.959
ARCHER: Want me to
help steer, or...?

08:31.027 --> 08:32.727
RILEY: Haven't you
done enough already?!

08:32.794 --> 08:35.996
ARCHER: Wh-?!
How is this suddenly my fault?!

08:36.065 --> 08:37.655
RILEY: Okay, this is it!

08:37.775 --> 08:39.999
C'mon Lucy Goosey, you can do it!

08:40.068 --> 08:43.236
Looking good, girl...
I think we're gonna be okay!

08:43.304 --> 08:44.837
ARCHER: Wait, you didn't
put the wheels down!

08:44.906 --> 08:47.706
RILEY: The wh -- Noooo!

09:47.402 --> 09:48.835
ARCHER: Woooooo!

09:48.904 --> 09:51.038
Two personal records!

09:51.107 --> 09:55.844
For breath holding and number of
sharks shot in the frickin face!

09:55.912 --> 09:58.647
Did you see that?

09:58.716 --> 09:59.815
Dude are you even alive?

09:59.884 --> 10:01.817
MALORY: No, that side's too low!

10:01.886 --> 10:03.586
CHERYL/CAROL: Well I
can't tell from here!

10:03.655 --> 10:05.521
MALORY: Well I can,
and it's too low.

10:05.590 --> 10:08.325
CYRIL: I think you mean premature...
MALORY: What'd you say?!

10:08.393 --> 10:09.025
CYRIL: Nothing!

10:09.094 --> 10:11.828
LANA: It's just that Archer obviously
doesn't want to come back,

10:11.897 --> 10:13.830
so I don't know how Riley's
gonna get him on a plane...

10:13.899 --> 10:16.265
CHERYL/CAROL: Which, I bet will crash...
CYRIL: Yeahhh!

10:16.334 --> 10:17.100
MALORY: Now you listen!

10:17.168 --> 10:20.469
Sterling is coming home safe and
sound, and when he does it'll be no

10:20.538 --> 10:24.373
thanks to you people, so you can
forget about getting Carvel!

10:24.442 --> 10:27.776
GILLETTE: Aww... Cookie Puss.

10:27.845 --> 10:30.812
RILEY: Wuzza... wuzz...
what the... what in the holy

10:30.881 --> 10:32.080
hell are you doing now?!

10:32.149 --> 10:34.516
ARCHER: Ugh, wondering why
this is called a D-Ration.

10:34.585 --> 10:35.851
Oughta call it a Y-ration.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.854
As in "Hey, this
tastes like catshit."

10:37.923 --> 10:41.191
RILEY: They're not candy bars,
jackass, they're survival rations!

10:41.260 --> 10:43.393
And they might have
to last us a while!

10:43.462 --> 10:47.598
ARCHER: Umm...
RILEY: You son of a -- okay, that is it!

10:47.667 --> 10:49.601
As of right now, I'm -- what the...?!

10:49.670 --> 10:51.603
ARCHER: Looking for this?

10:51.671 --> 10:52.537
RILEY: Give me that weapon.

10:52.605 --> 10:53.471
ARCHER: No. You're agitated.

10:53.539 --> 10:56.473
RILEY: I'm "agitated" because
you crashed my plane in the God

10:56.542 --> 10:59.442
knows if it's even the
middle of the Pacific Ocean!

10:59.511 --> 11:01.844
ARCHER: Yeah, which you're floating
on, and not getting shit out of

11:01.913 --> 11:02.712
a shark in!

11:02.781 --> 11:03.212
RILEY: Wait, what?

11:03.281 --> 11:05.447
ARCHER: I saved you from a shark!

11:05.516 --> 11:09.017
Let's see, after I pulled you out
of that shitheap of a plane,

11:09.086 --> 11:11.886
but before I gave you CPR
and bandaged your head!

11:11.955 --> 11:12.887
RILEY: Oh.

11:12.956 --> 11:13.788
Well... thanks.

11:13.857 --> 11:14.923
ARCHER: You're welcome.

11:14.991 --> 11:15.990
Sorry I ate so much food.

11:16.059 --> 11:17.492
RILEY: Yeah, that was
a pretty dick move...

11:17.560 --> 11:19.827
ARCHER: If it makes you feel any
better I puked most of it up --

11:19.896 --> 11:21.396
RILEY: It doesn't --
ARCHER: raft's pretty bobby.

11:21.464 --> 11:23.431
RILEY: Well we've got a few
gallons of fresh water,

11:23.500 --> 11:26.268
a desalinator for when that runs out...
let's see,

11:26.337 --> 11:28.970
flare gun and some flares,
fishing gear... oh!

11:29.039 --> 11:29.738
And this guy.

11:29.807 --> 11:30.338
ARCHER: What is that?

11:30.407 --> 11:31.406
RILEY: Emergency beacon.

11:31.475 --> 11:35.177
Beams a signal directly to the ISIS satellite...
BILBO: Oh well that's

11:35.246 --> 11:35.911
just great!

11:35.980 --> 11:39.081
Now I get to deal with this, as
my hot meatball sub congeals

11:39.149 --> 11:44.286
into a big fat disappointing
blob of shit.

11:44.354 --> 11:46.287
SIGINT NERD: Nobody's
gonna touch that?

11:46.356 --> 11:46.921
RILEY: Yeah.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.190
So I figure three days for ISIS
to get a rescue team out here.

11:49.259 --> 11:49.958
ARCHER: Nice!

11:50.026 --> 11:52.694
So we just kick back, catch a
few rays, catch some sushi...

11:52.763 --> 11:54.363
RILEY: Well it's not gonna
be a picnic, but --

11:54.432 --> 11:55.899
ARCHER: Hey, can I
check that thing out?

11:55.967 --> 11:57.367
RILEY: Okay, but don't
mess with the knobs, I've

11:57.435 --> 12:00.738
got the frequency all set, so --
ARCHER: Hey thanks, Guglielmo Marconi.

12:00.806 --> 12:03.941
Who I think invented the radio.

12:04.010 --> 12:04.475
Over.

12:04.544 --> 12:06.478
MALORY: But if the emergency
beacon is going off --

12:06.547 --> 12:09.548
oh my God, their plane crashed!

12:09.616 --> 12:13.052
CHERYL/CAROL: (gasps) I said
that would happen and it did!

12:13.120 --> 12:15.320
What if I have
psycho-kinetic powers?!

12:15.389 --> 12:18.957
PAM: I dunno, just try
to only use em for good.

12:19.026 --> 12:19.959
CHERYL/CAROL: No.

12:20.027 --> 12:20.826
MALORY: Well?!

12:20.895 --> 12:23.462
Don't just sit there sweating
like a gigantic cheese!

12:23.531 --> 12:24.329
Do something!

12:24.398 --> 12:25.230
BILBO: Ow, and I am.

12:25.299 --> 12:28.501
Our satellite's locked on
the beacon, which is, jeez,

12:28.569 --> 12:29.335
the middle of nowhere.

12:29.403 --> 12:30.135
MALORY: Lana, Ray!

12:30.204 --> 12:31.704
Get there this instant!

12:31.772 --> 12:33.939
LANA: Uh, sorta following
up on his thing about the

12:34.008 --> 12:37.076
middle of nowhere... how?

12:37.145 --> 12:39.045
The black titanium
corporate card?!

12:39.114 --> 12:40.981
PAM: I thought it was just a myth!

12:41.050 --> 12:43.684
Like a big, beautiful,
no-limit unicorn!

12:43.753 --> 12:46.854
MALORY: Charter a private jet to
Honolulu, then I don't care if you have

12:46.923 --> 12:49.590
to buy a plane, get out
there and find him!

12:49.659 --> 12:51.592
CYRIL: Wait, no, that's
not in the budget!

12:51.661 --> 12:54.227
MALORY: Say budget
to me again, Cyril.

12:54.296 --> 12:55.929
CYRIL: Save your receipts, please.

12:55.997 --> 12:58.664
MALORY: And call me the very
instant you have an update!

12:58.733 --> 12:59.265
And you!

12:59.333 --> 13:03.502
You lose my son, you'll have to drink
your meatballs subs through a straw.

13:03.571 --> 13:04.369
BILBO: Again, ow.

13:04.438 --> 13:08.073
And again, the satellite is locked
on the beacon, so unless he,

13:08.141 --> 13:11.776
I dunno, throws it away... MALORY: Wh-?
Why the hell would he do that?!

13:11.845 --> 13:12.577
ARCHER: I told you!

13:12.646 --> 13:14.012
I'm not going back there!

13:14.081 --> 13:17.616
RILEY: Well, you say that...
ARCHER: Riley no shit, I will shoot you.

13:17.685 --> 13:18.884
RILEY: And then I'll shoot you.

13:18.952 --> 13:19.384
With a flare.

13:19.453 --> 13:21.954
And then I'll use a D-ration bar
and two survival crackers to

13:22.023 --> 13:27.027
make s'mores over the crackling fire
that used to be your chest cavity.

13:27.095 --> 13:28.028
ARCHER: God damn, dude.

13:28.096 --> 13:30.030
RILEY: Sorry, but you're
acting really crazy.

13:30.099 --> 13:30.497
ARCHER: Well?!

13:30.566 --> 13:31.399
Being a spy makes you crazy!

13:31.467 --> 13:34.902
I mean what kind of job is that,
where your fiancée gets murdered?!

13:34.970 --> 13:36.036
Hello, stress!

13:36.105 --> 13:38.805
Don't even get me started on my mother,
I mean she -- RILEY: She can be

13:38.874 --> 13:42.043
a steel-clad bitch, I know,
why do you think I left ISIS?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.378
ARCHER: Wh-?
You were an ISIS agent?!

13:43.447 --> 13:45.380
RILEY: Briefly, way back.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.282
Didn't work out, because,
ya know, your mother...

13:47.351 --> 13:48.817
ARCHER: Was impossible
to please, right?

13:48.886 --> 13:50.586
RILEY: God, if you only knew...
ARCHER: What?

13:50.654 --> 13:52.788
RILEY: ...
how much your mom loves you!

13:52.857 --> 13:55.257
You would at least have the
heart to go tell her you're

13:55.326 --> 13:56.124
quitting in person.

13:56.193 --> 13:56.658
ARCHER: Eesh.

13:56.727 --> 13:58.627
Rather get shot with a flare...
RILEY: Oh, man up!

13:58.696 --> 13:59.328
Talk to your mother.

13:59.397 --> 14:02.832
Then you can go be a bartender, and
destroy a new marriage every week.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.133
ARCHER: C'mon, that
marriage was doomed.

14:04.202 --> 14:09.072
RILEY: And so are we, if we don't
work together out here, so... truce?

14:09.140 --> 14:12.842
ARCHER: Uh, ya, and hey,
we're not doomed!

14:12.911 --> 14:14.077
Look!

14:14.146 --> 14:15.278
Over here! Hey!

14:15.347 --> 14:17.547
RILEY: No no no wait, get down!

14:17.616 --> 14:18.081
ARCHER: Wh-?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.115
Don't you wanna get rescued?

14:19.184 --> 14:20.984
RILEY: Yeah, but those
could be pirates!

14:21.052 --> 14:23.086
ARCHER: Okay, well, they'll
just have to do 'til we

14:23.155 --> 14:25.021
find some cowboys and Indians.

14:25.090 --> 14:25.622
RILEY: What?!

14:25.690 --> 14:26.256
ARCHER: What what.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.626
What're you talking about?

14:29.694 --> 14:35.732
ARCHER: I'm sorry... I didn't know pirates
were...still a real thing.

14:39.859 --> 14:41.794
ARCHER: Man, this is not
at all what I pictured...

14:41.862 --> 14:42.594
I mean, you hear "pirate ship"

14:42.663 --> 14:46.198
you think sails, cannonballs...
oh, and not one of these guys has a beard.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.222
RILEY: You done?
ARCHER: Hang on.

14:48.501 --> 14:49.527
Planks.
Now I'm done.

14:49.775 --> 14:52.004
RILEY: Because the fact that
we're still alive tells me they

14:52.073 --> 14:54.807
wanna try to r --
ARCHER: Don't say rape.

14:54.875 --> 14:55.841
RILEY: Ransom us.

14:55.910 --> 14:56.808
ARCHER: Awesome.

14:56.877 --> 14:57.676
Compared to rape.

14:57.745 --> 14:59.377
Which seems like a thing
pirates would do.

14:59.446 --> 15:01.713
RILEY: But those numbskulls who
picked us up were so drunk --

15:01.782 --> 15:03.248
ARCHER: Now that did seem piratey.

15:03.317 --> 15:04.449
RILEY: -- they forgot to search me.

15:04.518 --> 15:05.984
ARCHER: Well, unless you've
got a bunch of Navy SEALs

15:06.052 --> 15:07.385
stuffed in your pants...
RILEY: No!

15:07.454 --> 15:08.486
I've got the signal beacon!

15:08.554 --> 15:08.886
ARCHER: So?

15:08.955 --> 15:10.654
RILEY: So we just stall the
pirates until the ISIS rescue

15:10.723 --> 15:13.057
team shows up, boards the
ship, and takes 'em all out!

15:13.125 --> 15:15.358
Bing, Bang, Boom.

15:15.427 --> 15:17.260
[ laughter ]

15:17.328 --> 15:18.828
RILEY: Which is funny why?

15:18.897 --> 15:20.730
ARCHER: Well, gee,
where do I start?

15:20.799 --> 15:24.000
GILLETTE: I will start with the
caviar and the '38 Montrachet,

15:24.069 --> 15:27.603
then do the Kobe tartare
with this '42 Lapin,

15:27.672 --> 15:30.606
and then this chocolate
terrine looks insaaane.

15:30.675 --> 15:32.875
And then I guess just send me
to fat camp and pray to God

15:32.944 --> 15:36.212
I don't eat all those fat,
delicious little chiddrens.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.847
Because I will gobble them up.

15:37.915 --> 15:40.516
RILEY: Wow, ISIS has
really gone downhill.

15:40.584 --> 15:41.950
But there must be
some good agents.

15:42.019 --> 15:44.852
ARCHER: It kills me to say
it, but it maybe Lana...

15:44.921 --> 15:47.288
LANA: Ray, I doubt that's what
Malory had in mind when she gave

15:47.357 --> 15:48.088
us the card.

15:48.157 --> 15:49.723
Ya know, we are on
a rescue mission.

15:49.792 --> 15:50.223
GILLETTE: Ugh.

15:50.292 --> 15:53.860
Rescue me from myself...
such a fatty.

15:53.929 --> 15:56.696
ARCHER: But even so, I wouldn't put
all my rescue eggs in that basket.

15:56.765 --> 15:57.130
RILEY: Well?!

15:57.199 --> 15:58.431
You got a better plan?!

15:58.500 --> 15:59.866
ARCHER: I don't, I'm
not really a planner.

15:59.935 --> 16:03.738
My process is a little more...
organic?

16:03.807 --> 16:04.506
PIRATE: Datang!

16:04.574 --> 16:05.640
Untuk kapten!

16:05.709 --> 16:09.077
ARCHER: So let's just play it by ear,
see where the afternoon takes us.

16:09.146 --> 16:09.578
See?

16:09.647 --> 16:11.881
This is why I like
to keep it loose.

16:11.950 --> 16:13.783
I mean the wine's crap,
but -- Oh, sorry.

16:13.852 --> 16:14.484
No offense, captain.

16:14.553 --> 16:16.787
CAPTAIN: No, I am who am sorry.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.922
This from million dollar yacht.

16:18.991 --> 16:21.825
Now I don't feel bad
for killing them.

16:21.894 --> 16:24.528
ARCHER: Serves em right, those jerks...
CAPTAIN: But you know wine!

16:24.597 --> 16:25.429
You rich man!

16:25.498 --> 16:27.898
ARCHER: Who me? No, I'm -- 
CAPTAIN: Rich man!

16:27.967 --> 16:29.866
My men take this off you!

16:29.935 --> 16:32.302
The Omicron Spacemaster!

16:32.371 --> 16:34.972
ARCHER: Oh, it's actually
the Sp -- acemaster, yeah.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.177
Good ol' Spacemaster...
CAPTAIN: To Sterleen... Love, Muddah.

16:39.245 --> 16:40.912
You muddah rich lady!

16:40.981 --> 16:41.813
ARCHER: Uh... oh!

16:41.882 --> 16:45.651
Yeah, crazy-rich, she invented
the splashless urinal cake.

16:45.719 --> 16:46.218
CAPTAIN: The what?

16:46.287 --> 16:48.888
ARCHER: They're -- doesn't matter,
she's rich and she loves me

16:48.957 --> 16:53.526
and I'm really rich and this is
my manservant, uh... Jerkins.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.427
RILEY: Funny stuff.

16:54.496 --> 16:55.428
ARCHER: Not now, Jerkins.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.797
So I bet she'd pay whatever
ransom you ask for.

16:57.866 --> 17:00.400
Splashless urinal cakes have
been pretty good to us.

17:00.469 --> 17:01.034
As you can imagine.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.869
CAPTAIN: This good to hear...
ARCHER: But we can't do any

17:03.938 --> 17:05.304
of that "mail somebody a finger"

17:05.373 --> 17:09.174
- shit, or -- 
- No, no, no we take you back to my island!

17:09.242 --> 17:12.609
Call you muddah, get
a big big money!

17:12.679 --> 17:13.144
ARCHER: Awesome.

17:13.213 --> 17:14.079
Compared to finger-mailing.

17:14.146 --> 17:17.148
So tell me about this
island of yours?

17:17.218 --> 17:19.018
BILBO: It's a tiny little
rock called Pangu...

17:19.087 --> 17:21.787
Nothin else within a thousand
miles, and the beacon's been

17:21.856 --> 17:24.123
headin straight for it
at about twenty knots.

17:24.192 --> 17:26.291
MALORY: So a ship must
have picked them up!

17:26.359 --> 17:27.960
But I've never even
heard of Pangu.

17:28.029 --> 17:30.096
Is there a naval base there, or...?

17:30.165 --> 17:31.798
BILBO: Mmmnot exactly.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.734
It's more of a, uh...
LANA: Pirate fortress.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.303
No, yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you said

17:36.371 --> 17:38.071
the phrase "pirate fortress."

17:38.140 --> 17:41.208
Which apparently, yes, you
did, say the word pirate,

17:41.277 --> 17:43.744
followed by the word --
CAPTAIN: Fortress!

17:43.813 --> 17:47.515
That is the word, My english so crap...
ARCHER: Eh, I bet you just need

17:47.584 --> 17:48.182
more practice.

17:48.251 --> 17:50.752
Try this: Jerkins,
you're a douchebag!

17:50.821 --> 17:51.386
RILEY: Funny stuff.

17:51.455 --> 17:53.188
CAPTAIN: Jehkin, you dooshaback!

17:53.257 --> 17:54.222
ARCHER: Keep at it.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.557
Oh and hey, did we cross the
international date line?

17:56.626 --> 18:00.695
Because I can change the date for
you on that Omicron Spacemaster.

18:00.763 --> 18:01.329
CAPTAIN: Eh?

18:01.397 --> 18:05.899
Yeah, okay dumb guy... ARCHER: Wouldn't
want to be walking around like a

18:05.968 --> 18:06.766
dickhead!

18:06.835 --> 18:11.003
With the wrong date on your...
Omicron Spymaster!

18:11.072 --> 18:11.671
CAPTAIN: Wh-?!

18:11.739 --> 18:12.738
Wuzza hell dumb guy?

18:12.807 --> 18:15.007
ARCHER: It's the
Omicron Spymaster!

18:15.076 --> 18:17.977
Which is why it's got knockout
gas and a garrote and I think

18:18.045 --> 18:21.180
even a laser and Riley do I have
to kill everybody myself?!

18:21.249 --> 18:25.250
RILEY: Huh? Oh!

18:25.319 --> 18:27.019
ARCHER: Seriously, what
the hell, Riley?!

18:27.087 --> 18:28.720
RILEY: I didn't know you
were making a move!

18:28.789 --> 18:29.788
ARCHER: Uh, dickhead?!

18:29.856 --> 18:31.022
RILEY: Takes one to know one.

18:31.091 --> 18:33.024
ARCHER: No!
Dickhead was the go-word!

18:33.093 --> 18:34.392
RILEY: How was I
supposed to know?!

18:34.461 --> 18:36.662
ARCHER: Oh. Yeah sorry, I forgot
to tell you the go-word was --

18:36.730 --> 18:41.967
CAPTAIN: Dooshaback!

18:42.036 --> 18:44.070
ARCHER: But even still,
Riley you gotta be quicker.

18:44.138 --> 18:46.639
I mean, I know you're pretty old but --
RILEY: Well now that I know the

18:46.708 --> 18:48.909
go-word, I -- 
ARCHER: No, idiot, it changes every time.

18:48.977 --> 18:49.877
RILEY: Well what is it now?

18:49.945 --> 18:50.444
ARCHER: Pirates!

18:50.513 --> 18:56.050
RILEY: Kinda confusing, since we're on a --
Owww! Come on, that was right

18:56.119 --> 18:57.085
next to my frickin ear!

18:57.153 --> 18:59.487
ARCHER: Sorry, I know that hurts.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.889
Happens to me kind of a lot.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.025
I actually have like
mild tinnitis now.

19:04.093 --> 19:09.330
I mean, it's gotten to where I had
to start sleeping with a fan on.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.767
RILEY: Oh my God... ARCHER: Yeah,
otherwise it's like eeeeeeeeeee.

19:12.835 --> 19:15.036
RILEY: No, you just
killed like, ten pirates.

19:15.105 --> 19:17.038
ARCHER: Wow, and if the
five-year old me knew that

19:17.106 --> 19:19.440
he would get a huge boner.

19:19.509 --> 19:20.575
No idea why I said that.

19:20.643 --> 19:22.777
RILEY: Well once these idiots
figure out they can turn those

19:22.846 --> 19:28.183
twenty-millimeter cannons on the
wheelhouse, we'll be -- kinda confused.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.084
ARCHER: What are they doing?

19:29.153 --> 19:30.852
RILEY: It looks like
they're surrendering!

19:30.921 --> 19:31.286
ARCHER: Why?

19:31.355 --> 19:33.154
All they have to do is --
RILEY: Shut up, who cares why?

19:33.223 --> 19:33.855
ARCHER: I do!

19:33.924 --> 19:34.656
What if it's a ruse?

19:34.725 --> 19:35.557
RILEY: It's not a ruse!

19:35.626 --> 19:37.259
Say something, before
they change their minds!

19:37.328 --> 19:39.094
ARCHER: Do they speak English?

19:39.163 --> 19:40.896
Uh... hello, pirates!

19:40.965 --> 19:44.066
Who speaks English,
let's see some hands!

19:44.135 --> 19:46.102
ARCHER: Wow, way
more than I thought.

19:46.171 --> 19:47.103
NOAH: Uh, excuse me?

19:47.172 --> 19:49.072
Sorry, hi, I'm Noah?

19:49.141 --> 19:50.607
ARCHER: What're you,
the first mate, or...?

19:50.676 --> 19:54.478
NOAH: Oh!
Oh God no, no, I'm a bajak budak?

19:54.547 --> 19:58.849
It's sort of a -- well, I guess the
nearest translation is slave-pirate?

19:58.918 --> 20:00.117
ARCHER: Do you speak English?

20:00.186 --> 20:01.018
NOAH: I do.

20:01.087 --> 20:03.687
They don't, though, they're just
surrendering the ship to you.

20:03.756 --> 20:04.688
Dan benteng?

20:04.757 --> 20:05.122
PIRATE: Ya.

20:05.191 --> 20:05.890
NOAH: And the fort.

20:05.958 --> 20:06.824
You're the new captain.

20:06.893 --> 20:07.425
ARCHER: The what?!

20:07.493 --> 20:10.294
NOAH: Well if you kill the old
captain, you become the new captain.

20:10.363 --> 20:12.996
I know you don't think of
pirates as having a lot of

20:13.065 --> 20:15.131
rules, but they actually
do and that's a big one.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.333
ARCHER: Well, tell them...
hands down!

20:17.402 --> 20:19.536
NOAH: Tangan ke bawah!

20:19.604 --> 20:20.370
ARCHER: Holy shit!

20:20.438 --> 20:21.304
Did you see that?!

20:21.373 --> 20:24.106
RILEY: No, I'm too busy looking at that...
ARCHER: What is...

20:24.175 --> 20:25.040
what am I seeing?

20:25.109 --> 20:28.143
NOAH: Oh, the women always us throw a
huge feast when we return to port.

20:28.212 --> 20:30.112
Should I tell them
to cancel it, or...?

20:30.180 --> 20:31.146
ARCHER: Huh?

20:31.215 --> 20:34.415
No, we're totally feasting!

20:34.484 --> 20:35.016
Say that!

20:35.085 --> 20:37.319
NOAH: Mulai pesta!

20:37.387 --> 20:38.152
RILEY: Nice plan.

20:38.221 --> 20:41.556
Once they're good and drunk we'll
turn this tub around and head home.

20:41.625 --> 20:44.159
ARCHER: Home?
Riley... I am home.

20:44.227 --> 20:47.061
RILEY: Wh-? ! Over my dead body are you
running away to be a pirate!

20:47.130 --> 20:51.010
ARCHER: Of course I'm not
gonna be a pirate...

20:52.731 --> 20:54.840
I'm gonna be a pirate king.
