00:14.014 --> 00:16.099
[footsteps approaching]

00:16.183 --> 00:18.101
Why do you keep playing with that?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.688
Because I'm skeptical.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.606
Do you think this really works?

00:22.690 --> 00:25.859
Oh, it's just about
making the candidate seem familiar,

00:25.943 --> 00:28.195
so that the voter sees herself in him.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.823
But... you've gone too far.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.159
There.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.913
Congratulations, Francis.
You have my vote.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.125
-When do you leave for New York?
-Now.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.254
-Then I'm back for the event with Cathy.
-Mmm.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.548
It's very risky, what Macallan is doing.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.303
Do you think it's worth it?

00:56.514 --> 00:58.350
[Frank chuckling]

01:13.531 --> 01:15.533
[theme music playing]

02:51.379 --> 02:54.091
-[Doug] Danton and Sharp just lawyered up.
-They don't want to testify?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.550
And there's no way subpoenas get them

02:55.633 --> 02:56.844
in front of the committee
before the election.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.805
There's a rumor the committee's trying
to make a deal with Garrett Walker.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.016
No, Walker doesn't want
to do damage to the party.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.810
So why did Jim Matthews agree to appear?

03:04.893 --> 03:06.937
I'm already getting pummeled
with questions about it.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.107
-Does he have anything to say?
-Uh, even if he pleads the Fifth,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.484
they get a perp walk
that implicates the president.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.154
I didn't know anyone actually ate those.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.907
I look forward to this stuff all year.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.703
Do we have anything
on the committee members?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.705
Nothing too juicy yet, I'm afraid.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.625
Vice chairman had an affair
with a young male staffer

03:28.708 --> 03:31.879
before he came out to his wife. Old news.

03:31.962 --> 03:36.049
Committee chairman's squeaky clean
other than a minor back-tax issue.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.887
I did find some revenge porn
on the chairman's chief of staff,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.430
but I don't think it's worth much.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.891
[Doug] Is it enough to scare her?

03:43.974 --> 03:48.686
[grunts] Embarrass her, probably.
More than that, probably not.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.731
[sex tape playing on phone]

03:55.443 --> 03:57.279
[camera shutters clicking]

04:00.991 --> 04:03.618
[Adalardi] I gotta say, they look
a lot better on you, Mrs. Underwood,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.287
than they would on Governor Conway.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.579
[crowd chuckling]

04:06.663 --> 04:09.124
Maybe that's why
he didn't wanna pay for it.

04:09.207 --> 04:15.255
[chuckles] These masks will be distributed
to all MTA engineers,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.632
conductors and maintenance workers.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.511
And this model is highly effective
in case of a chemical attack.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.972
And I believe Mayor Adalardi would like
to say a few words.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.182
Absolutely.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.600
[clears throat]

04:27.684 --> 04:30.603
Safety in all branches
of the public transportation system

04:30.687 --> 04:32.480
-is my number one priority.
-Ken?

04:32.564 --> 04:36.401
-That means subways, that means buses...
-It's fine, I know him.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.611
What are you doing here?

04:38.695 --> 04:41.198
-What? This is my stop.
-Oh. [chuckles]

04:41.281 --> 04:43.784
-Well, you look well.
-Well, I can't complain.

04:43.867 --> 04:48.831
Can't complain, except...
Well, I'm sure you heard about Tim.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.332
Corbet? No.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.710
-Beth didn't call?
-No.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.880
Oh, man. [sighs]
I hate to be the one to tell you this.

04:56.964 --> 05:02.344
Tim went out on the Arkansas River.
He's been missing for two days now.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.014
[stuttering] I thought for sure
the president would have heard.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.558
I mean, I can't imagine
how Frank's gonna take this.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.144
Oh, my goodness!
Beth and the kids must be so distraught.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.023
Sure. But Frank and Tim's relationship
was special.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.736
It's great to see you, Claire.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.197
Would you ask Frank to give me a call?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.867
-Mrs. Underwood?
-Uh, just one moment.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.539
See that gentleman I was speaking to?
Go ask him to wait for me, please.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.542
[Frank] <i>Governors,</i>
<i>we are running out of time.</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:39.547
The fact that you are here at this
emergency meeting on such short notice

05:39.631 --> 05:44.552
tells the American people that you are
as concerned about their safety as I am.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.889
Terror is unacceptable.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.681
I do not accept it.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.311
But we will not be deterred
by Washington's failure to address it.

05:53.395 --> 05:58.483
We will work together,
side by side, fighting back.

05:58.566 --> 06:02.654
State by state, city by city,
neighborhood by neighborhood.

06:02.737 --> 06:09.452
Because, make no mistake...
we are engaged in the battle of our time.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.705
The question of what it is
to be an American,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.417
the very essence of American-ness,

06:15.500 --> 06:20.755
how we choose to lead our lives,
open and free, is on the line.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.676
Fear is un-American.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.098
And yes, the irony of saying those words
to you on Halloween, of all days,

06:30.182 --> 06:32.225
-is not lost on me.
-[crowd chuckles]

06:32.309 --> 06:37.940
But although we may choose, as Americans,
to scare ourselves once a year for fun...

06:38.731 --> 06:44.237
no one else tells any American when
to shake in their boots at any other time.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.074
So I am issuing an executive order,

06:47.157 --> 06:51.703
by virtue of the authority vested in me
as President of the United States

06:51.786 --> 06:54.164
and commander in chief
of the armed forces.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.375
By our Constitution
and the laws of our land,

06:57.459 --> 07:00.837
including Section Blah-Blah
of the Blah-Blah Act

07:00.920 --> 07:06.301
and Section Blah-Blah of Title Blah-Blah,
Paragraph Bullshit-Bullshit.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.927
In case you have no idea what's going on,

07:08.011 --> 07:10.931
I'm swelling these states'
National Guard troops

07:11.014 --> 07:14.559
to create secure public spaces
on Election Day.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.313
I'm urging these governors
to consolidate their polling sites

07:18.396 --> 07:21.774
and create quote, unquote "voting centers"

07:21.858 --> 07:24.277
so that people feel safe
to come out and vote.

07:24.361 --> 07:29.407
I'm commending Governor Sally Morrison
of the great state of Arizona,

07:29.491 --> 07:33.161
for giving us all such a good example
of voting centers

07:33.245 --> 07:35.872
as used in their recent primary.

07:35.956 --> 07:41.586
But what I'm really doing is
seducing the governors of five key states.

07:41.669 --> 07:46.716
New Jersey, Nevada, Illinois,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

07:46.799 --> 07:51.554
Messrs. Harcourt, NuÃ±ez, Gallinard,

07:51.638 --> 07:56.018
Olmstead and Matthews.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.270
Oh, you remember Matthews, don't you?

07:58.353 --> 08:01.689
Former vice president
to President Garrett Walker.

08:01.773 --> 08:05.610
Nothing but a provincial
and petty pen-stealer.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.323
But I need him.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.244
I need all five on my side
if I'm gonna win this election.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.790
Matthews, in our history,
he's the biggest known unknown.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.252
Oh, and I almost forgot.
The boy wonder is here.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.964
My worthy opponent.
Out of his element and stuck in mine.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.427
But, you see, in politics,
stature is everything.

08:31.469 --> 08:35.807
And wouldn't you say that
Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?

08:38.059 --> 08:41.145
<i>These border restrictions</i>
<i>the president is proposing...</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:43.981
<i>should the military play a role</i>
<i>in enforcing them, General?</i>

08:44.066 --> 08:45.567
<i>I think we need to take a step back</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:48.153
<i>and look at</i>
<i>our national security priorities.</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:52.282
<i>And what constitutes appropriate</i>
<i>deployment of our serving men and women.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:56.619
<i>As veterans, this issue is a personal one</i>
<i>for Governor Conway and me.</i>

08:56.703 --> 08:58.288
<i>-Would you and--</i>
<i>-I'll tell you something else.</i>

08:58.371 --> 08:59.789
<i>You won't hear this</i>
<i>from the governor himself,</i>

08:59.872 --> 09:04.377
<i>but his military career is distinguished</i>
<i>by exceptional acts of bravery.</i>

09:04.461 --> 09:09.174
<i>In particular, the incident for which he</i>
<i>was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.</i>

09:09.257 --> 09:12.009
<i>Speaks to the kind of commander in chief</i>
<i>he will be.</i>

09:12.094 --> 09:15.138
<i>Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:18.015
<i>Someday soon, America needs</i>
<i>to hear the full story of that day.</i>

09:18.100 --> 09:20.352
<i>Thank you for your time,</i>
<i>General Brockhart.</i>

09:20.435 --> 09:21.478
<i>Glad to talk to you.</i>

09:21.561 --> 09:23.688
<i>Coming up next on </i> Special Report,
<i>we take a look at...</i>

09:23.771 --> 09:26.691
I swear to God, if Underwood puts soldiers
on those borders,

09:26.774 --> 09:29.277
I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.528
[sighs]

09:30.612 --> 09:32.655
In terms of allocation of funds,

09:32.739 --> 09:35.200
it's our water supply
that keeps me up at night.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.120
Roger, are you talking about
protecting the infrastructure?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.080
Infrastructure and water sources.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.291
Reservoirs, the dams,
the tunnel delivery systems--

09:43.375 --> 09:44.417
All of it, yes.

09:44.501 --> 09:48.505
Protection from terrorism, sure,
but the voters see even greater dangers.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.757
Structural, environmental,
toxins from algae.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.259
Algae's quite a problem for us.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.803
The big question here,
are the feds doing all they can do?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.430
Well, the feds want to do even more.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.266
That's the reason
that we're all meeting here today.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.808
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see

10:00.892 --> 10:02.685
is that we're in violent agreement
with each other.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.854
I mean, Roger,
how long have we known each other?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.106
How far do we go back?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.982
You knew me when I had hair,
Mr. President.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.066
[crowd chuckles]

10:09.151 --> 10:11.194
It doesn't change the fact
that my constituents are saying,

10:11.278 --> 10:13.029
"Give me a bridge, not a war zone."

10:13.113 --> 10:14.030
All I'm saying is that

10:14.114 --> 10:16.699
we need to anticipate threats
when we can and thwart them.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.743
I'm saying that we're days away
from an election,

10:18.826 --> 10:22.330
-and I don't wanna upset the apple cart.
-Excuse me for just a moment.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.042
[whispers] Will, have you seen this?

10:28.961 --> 10:31.088
[softly] All right.
I'll deal with him later.

10:32.089 --> 10:36.511
-Tell me exactly what she said.
-Just that she heard it from Ken Caswell.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.519
I checked with the local authorities
in Salida, sir.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.271
It doesn't look good.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.399
-The chances of--
-Amp up the search.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.278
Whatever materials and personnel they need
in addition to what they have, give them.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.156
And reach out to Beth Corbet.
I'd like to speak to her directly.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.699
Yes, sir.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.290
[Conway] I haven't slept
a good night's sleep since 2012.

11:05.373 --> 11:09.669
But I guess elected officials don't sleep
so our constituents can.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.005
The proof of success in fighting terror...

11:13.923 --> 11:16.050
is something the public never hears about.

11:16.968 --> 11:21.180
A certain city in my state wears
the biggest target in the nation.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.809
The city and state of New York...

11:24.892 --> 11:27.937
has scored silent wins for 15 years...

11:28.896 --> 11:30.732
without a declaration of war.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.235
Now...

11:34.277 --> 11:35.528
in most cases...

11:36.654 --> 11:39.532
I would argue
the states can take care of themselves.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.785
-Mr. President!
-Well, by all means, continue, Governor.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.913
What... what was that part
you were talking about? Insomnia?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.082
My point is,

11:48.165 --> 11:51.669
we're all Americans in this room,
and we all love this country.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.129
And I'd like to thank the president

11:53.212 --> 11:56.633
for the opportunity
to discuss this very important topic,

11:56.716 --> 12:00.428
and apologize for, uh,
being on such a tight schedule.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.138
Well, we are enormously grateful

12:02.221 --> 12:05.267
that the governor took the time
to come and join us today.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.436
[Claire] I'm just trying to understand.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.024
Claire, if I said anything
to offend you, it was entirely...

12:13.107 --> 12:16.152
I mean, you know me. No filter.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.112
And that's what worries me.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.157
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.828
-Did you come down here with an agenda?
-No. I mean...

12:25.912 --> 12:28.873
I have been trying to reach Frank,
but today was just...

12:28.956 --> 12:32.877
I saw that you were appearing at an event
and I showed up to say hi.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.756
I... I really do work around here,
on a street called "Wall," you know?

12:36.839 --> 12:39.967
But then you made reference to something
about two very close friends

12:40.051 --> 12:42.720
that's nobody's business, including yours.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.767
And you even said so yourself, Ken,
that you have an awfully big mouth.

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
I...

12:50.728 --> 12:52.772
I lost a dear friend.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.400
I loved Tim. Everybody did.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.611
And you implied Francis especially.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.739
Well, yeah. I mean...
[stutters] That was a whole other thing.

13:01.823 --> 13:02.782
In what way?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.954
In... [chuckles]
What do you want me to say?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.915
[stammers] I'm sure
I don't know anything you don't.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.961
I'm just very interested
in your perspective.

13:15.044 --> 13:19.424
[sighs] Frank worshipped Tim,
would have done anything for him.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.844
I don't know.

13:22.927 --> 13:27.098
If the world were a different place
back then... who knows?

13:30.602 --> 13:35.231
That was a long time ago.
And then he met you.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.733
And lucky him.

13:38.109 --> 13:42.154
Look, in terms of my firm and...
and trying to get the president's ear...

13:42.238 --> 13:44.741
I mean, yeah, it's a little embarrassing

13:44.824 --> 13:49.454
that my friend of 30-whatever years
didn't have time to pick up the phone.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.333
He should have called you back.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.213
Francis and Tim were very good friends.

14:00.882 --> 14:06.888
But, you know, Ken, the older I get,
I learn that assumptions are dangerous.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.642
Sure. Okay.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.353
It was great to see you.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.652
[Ken sighs]

14:37.419 --> 14:39.170
[indistinct chatter]

14:40.880 --> 14:42.799
[Yates] So where is she?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.885
[LeAnn] Change of plans.
She needed to stay in New York.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.055
She asked me
to put something together for this.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.473
Yeah? Well, something came up.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.141
The vice president will be
filling in for her.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.187
[imitates guitar strumming]

14:56.270 --> 14:58.314
-[chuckles]
-Oh, my...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.149
-Hey, man.
-[laughs] Hey.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.987
Uh, we played in a terrible band
together back in the day.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.491
Before adulthood and alimony
came crashing down.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.704
-Two exes? Wow.
-Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.040
So, uh, where's the First Lady?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.419
-Something came up.
-Hmm.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.755
I'd love to ask you a few questions
about working on the campaign.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.340
[Yates] I'm just a speechwriter.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.468
[Haines] Exactly.
How the hell did that happen? [chuckles]

15:26.551 --> 15:28.803
[moderator] Welcome to
the Council on Foreign Relations

15:28.886 --> 15:32.640
and this special event
on Crossing Borders: The Way Forward.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.437
I smell a swing state party.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.232
-Tone, Rick.
-[pen clatters]

15:41.315 --> 15:44.694
You didn't have to round up dozens of
governors just to talk to the five of us.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.279
You're here because
there have been concerning threats

15:47.363 --> 15:49.532
in exurban counties
in each of your states.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.283
Could you be more specific?

15:51.367 --> 15:54.871
We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon,
Elko, Jefferson counties.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.749
Also Chester and McHenry.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.627
Which is why it's crucial that we work
with your states' administrations

16:00.710 --> 16:02.670
leading up to the election.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.549
Every one of those precincts is
a typically Republican stronghold.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.968
This isn't about party affiliation.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.888
As the president said,
this is about security.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.850
Now, we believe this course of action,

16:15.933 --> 16:18.310
the voting centers
with the added law enforcement,

16:18.394 --> 16:19.937
will give us everything that we need

16:20.021 --> 16:21.773
to protect the integrity
of the ballot box.

16:21.856 --> 16:25.317
Okay, but speaking for Governor Olmstead
and maybe all of our bosses,

16:25.401 --> 16:26.569
how can we be sure that these measures

16:26.653 --> 16:29.113
won't discourage everyone
from getting to the polls?

16:29.196 --> 16:32.366
-I.e., Democrats.
-[Doug] It's a chance we have to take.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.410
But we don't believe
it'll play out that way.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.079
We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.583
Preventing further acts of terrorism
is just about all that matters, Tanya.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.879
Now, I do realize
with these heightened threats

16:44.962 --> 16:47.715
comes an additional strain
on the governors of your states.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.800
So...

16:50.510 --> 16:52.720
I say to each and every one of you...

16:53.763 --> 16:55.848
tell me how we can help.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.060
[moderator] Putting aside
the very real moral questions,

16:59.143 --> 17:02.522
how is shutting down the borders
even feasible?

17:03.439 --> 17:08.484
I know this policy is going to hurt
some people,

17:08.569 --> 17:11.280
but let me explain why it's necessary.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.454
And the vice president should
feel free to jump in.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.125
But is it fun?

17:23.209 --> 17:27.003
-Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?
-That's not what I do.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.381
It's more like the opposite.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.678
I just try and articulate...

17:33.761 --> 17:37.056
what's on their minds and in their hearts.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.766
That's how you see your job?

17:40.101 --> 17:43.855
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.316
Were you with them that night?
The night Jim Miller was killed?

17:48.359 --> 17:51.362
[sighs] I'm not gonna answer that.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.365
-I'll take that as a "yes."
-Don't.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.784
I'm just trying to understand
what you do.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.120
Then you're missing the point.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.748
I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.001
[Haines breathes heavily]

18:06.460 --> 18:11.215
-You make yourself sound replaceable.
-[chuckles nervously]

18:13.217 --> 18:14.218
I am.

18:14.301 --> 18:18.765
-I serve at the pleasure of the president.
-And the First Lady?

18:18.848 --> 18:21.934
The Democratic
vice presidential candidate...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.061
Yeah. Her, too.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.147
But you write speeches for both of them?

18:27.148 --> 18:29.441
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.945
Articulating what's on her mind
and in her heart?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.155
Mmm-hmm.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.283
-I'm just a mouthpiece.
-Mmm.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.704
Has she put you in charge
of any other parts?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.291
Wow. [chuckles]

18:45.374 --> 18:48.044
-You're still an asshole, man.
-[chuckles]

18:50.129 --> 18:52.173
-Good luck with the alimony.
-[chuckles]

18:56.093 --> 18:58.220
[inhales deeply and grunts]

18:59.513 --> 19:01.265
[indistinct chatter]

19:05.561 --> 19:08.064
-That was rough.
-[Blythe] It went fine.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.817
It's not sustainable.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.568
I mean, what do you think?

19:13.695 --> 19:17.949
-About what?
-About the president's rush to war.

19:18.032 --> 19:21.035
At least half the Beltway seems to think
it's outrageous.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.244
It is outrageous.

19:23.746 --> 19:28.876
We could resign our posts,
you know, in protest.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.838
I bet we can convince others
of the cabinet to do the same thing.

19:31.921 --> 19:36.342
Outrageous by design, I was going to say.
It's smart, what the president's doing.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.428
-It's serving him in the polls.
-Donald.

19:40.512 --> 19:44.641
Let's... take a step back for a moment.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.478
I underestimated you. I did.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.272
When you were acting president,
my faith was less than full.

19:50.356 --> 19:54.360
But now, I understand
the terrible box you were in, the forces--

19:54.443 --> 19:56.779
Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.074
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about. [chuckles]

20:00.157 --> 20:05.079
Are you telling me your plan is just
to phone it in until January 20th?

20:07.081 --> 20:10.960
Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?

20:12.544 --> 20:13.545
Back in the day,

20:13.629 --> 20:16.382
you and Marjorie were at the forefront
of every progressive cause,

20:16.465 --> 20:18.592
literally fighting the good fight.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.052
These people...

20:21.303 --> 20:23.973
can we really let them do this?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.976
You wanna walk down memory lane,
Cathy? Okay.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.730
Remember the convention?
Remember the <i>Politico</i> article?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.899
I offered you an out.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.360
You should've taken that opportunity
to resign, then and there.

20:36.443 --> 20:40.406
-Circumstances were nothing like this.
-Sure they were.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.116
You just didn't want to see it.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.701
And, just so you know,

20:44.786 --> 20:48.205
right before her mind was truly gone,
Marjorie called it.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.000
She saw the unholy alliance
you were making with Frank Underwood.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.920
She called it.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.938
So this meeting
between our bosses today...

21:13.773 --> 21:14.774
The president is looking forward

21:14.857 --> 21:16.733
to a productive discussion
with Governor Matthews.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.903
There's no one else here.
Can we cut the crap?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.030
You want us to engage
in voter suppression.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.207
It's not a phrase I'd ever use.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.918
Fine. Call it "motor depression"
for all I care.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.839
We get it. White people are the problem.
Republicans. Understood.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.299
But my boss doesn't happen to be
up for reelection.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.302
[sighs] I'm listening.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.931
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."

21:47.014 --> 21:49.558
Matthews wants the EPA
to name a slag heap

21:49.641 --> 21:52.103
on the outskirts of Philadelphia
as a Superfund site.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.771
I seriously doubt
that can happen before the election.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.149
I think you should battle
your doubts, Doug.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.776
The governor is willing
to let the past stay in the past.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.696
But unless the Underwood administration
is bearing top-tier gifts,

22:02.779 --> 22:06.492
you've got a lot of fucking nerve
asking for favors from the former VP.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.578
On the other hand,
if you make things right,

22:09.661 --> 22:11.497
Matthews will do his part.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.584
Don't you always feel sorry
for the horse?

22:27.096 --> 22:29.098
[indistinct chatter]

22:52.079 --> 22:53.830
Who's in the conference room?

22:53.915 --> 22:56.542
-You mean the lady brigade?
-What?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.128
That's what they call
the NSA forensic auditors.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.175
Yeah, I... I didn't know
they were scheduled for today.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.927
That's their routine. They just show up.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.346
-Welcome to the NSA.
-[chuckles]

23:14.476 --> 23:15.394
Hey, boss.

23:16.853 --> 23:17.688
Oh.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.792
[Matthews] May I, Mr. President?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.627
[Frank] Well, that's what
they're there for.

23:40.711 --> 23:44.715
I won't take up much of your time.
I know you have a busy afternoon.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.468
-Well, I've got a little time.
-I'm curious.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.763
Why do you think the committee
decided to call you first?

23:53.307 --> 23:54.600
Because I asked them to.

23:56.935 --> 24:01.898
Well, this emergency governors' conference
of yours came up and, uh...

24:01.983 --> 24:04.026
I'm sure you recall,
I don't much like DC,

24:04.110 --> 24:07.571
so I figured why not make it
one-stop shopping?

24:07.654 --> 24:08.739
Yes.

24:08.822 --> 24:12.743
But, of course,
we both know that executive privilege

24:12.826 --> 24:16.080
could've negated your having to appear
at one of those shops.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.334
Jim?

24:21.460 --> 24:26.048
I'm going to help you with your slag heap.
I hope that means that I can count on you.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.260
Of course that's what it means.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.472
We're members of a tiny brotherhood,
you and I, of ex-VPs.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.723
[Frank chuckles]

24:35.932 --> 24:38.394
When, and if, Garrett Walker appears
before this committee,

24:38.477 --> 24:40.187
do you think he'll...

24:41.105 --> 24:44.566
-betray the party?
-You mean you?

24:46.360 --> 24:48.362
Well, that would be the same thing.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.699
Now, I don't know what really happened

24:52.783 --> 24:55.327
on your journey to replace me
as vice president

24:55.411 --> 24:57.163
and then Garrett as president.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.374
I only know what my gut tells me.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.710
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.

25:10.217 --> 25:14.513
Bottom line is I can help you
with this committee or I can hurt you.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.935
Now, I can say that I know nothing...

25:21.312 --> 25:24.773
and that what I saw in Garrett Walker
was a troubled man.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.152
And I can leave it at that.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.158
What do you think?

25:35.534 --> 25:39.163
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.

25:39.246 --> 25:44.000
But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,

25:44.085 --> 25:46.002
that this cleanup in Pennsylvania

25:46.087 --> 25:49.715
is gonna be worth about
$300 million and 10,000 jobs.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.593
And that's not bad
for an afternoon's work.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.931
I like the new rug.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.891
Oh, thank you.
I didn't have much to do with it.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.103
It was really Claire's design.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.605
-Good to see you, Mr. President.
-You, too.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.116
Governor Scanlon.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.743
Mr. President.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.912
[Frank] You've been on my mind.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.667
I wanna talk to your boss
about the Declaration of War Committee.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.922
So... if you're hoping to intimidate him
because of the back taxes,

26:31.006 --> 26:32.633
you can save your breath.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.885
His closet is back to being clean.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.973
-[sex tape playing on phone]
-What about yours?

26:42.934 --> 26:44.270
[video stops playing]

26:46.897 --> 26:49.441
-You're a pig.
-Hey, I didn't watch it.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.610
I'm just the messenger.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.613
-Be mad at the dude who posted it.
-I am.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.032
There are ways to get rid of it.

26:58.074 --> 27:01.412
It's a goodwill gift.
To let you know I'm serious.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.875
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later,
I get called.

27:06.958 --> 27:11.129
And if that happens,
I could plead the Fifth.

27:11.213 --> 27:14.550
I could press-secretary them all day long.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.761
But I'd like to have another option
on the table.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.390
Yeah, I can't be
a public witness myself...

27:21.473 --> 27:25.311
but if you offer me
anonymity and immunity...

27:25.894 --> 27:28.021
I can testify privately.

27:28.104 --> 27:32.025
Tell the committee
where the bodies are buried, so to speak.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.069
But, just to be clear, you're telling me

27:34.152 --> 27:37.072
you have evidence the president engaged
in criminal activity?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.366
Not evidence regarding the president, no.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.661
I have a lot of information
about his chief of staff.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.788
Doug Stamper.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.585
Talk to your boss. Let me know.

27:55.424 --> 28:00.596
Uh, Bridget, total non sequitur...
You have a very elegant neck.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.940
[indistinct chatter]

28:28.915 --> 28:29.916
[Sean] Mr. Grayson?

28:31.418 --> 28:34.004
Sean Jeffries. I'm with the <i>Herald.</i>

28:34.087 --> 28:35.672
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.

28:36.590 --> 28:40.511
-How long have you been with the paper?
-Thirteen months. Style section.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.430
Oh, that would explain
why I don't know you.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.934
Man's tie is a window into his soul.
We just ran a piece on it.

28:48.935 --> 28:52.523
Oh, yeah?
So, uh, what does my tie say about me?

28:52.606 --> 28:55.567
It says you're a dedicated civil servant
with the bank account to prove it.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.610
[chuckles]

28:56.693 --> 28:58.737
Anyway, recognized you,
just wanted to say hi.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.947
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.659
You know, uh, Cam Lawder?
Lobbyist for Mercedes-Benz?

29:03.742 --> 29:07.120
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk,
works at the DoD.

29:07.203 --> 29:12.125
And that's Randy Beauford.
Personal trainer for fat Washington fucks.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.670
We're going old school this afternoon.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.963
Come on, join us for a quick one.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.889
"Mouthpiece"?

29:25.972 --> 29:28.183
I don't know why he was talking
to the press in the first place.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.977
An unfortunate choice of word
for Tom, no doubt.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.854
But still, it'll play itself out.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.358
But what I want to know is,
what do you see?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.277
Why don't you like Yates?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.904
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.
His speeches have been--

29:40.987 --> 29:43.282
Oh, look.
He has more responsibilities than that.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.701
You know it. So that bothers you.

29:46.618 --> 29:51.748
I... just wouldn't want anyone to infer
a personal investment on his part

29:51.832 --> 29:54.543
that isn't useful to the campaign.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.296
I suppose all I'm saying is that

29:57.379 --> 30:00.591
I won't let anything happen
to the First Lady or you, Mr. President.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.468
I appreciate that, LeAnn.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.847
[Aidan] We are fucked, Mr. President.
Pardon my French.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.641
I don't care about your French.
Why am I even talking to you?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.393
[Aidan] Well, the NSA
has sent in auditors.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.645
If I don't erase my files,
cover my tracks--

30:13.729 --> 30:15.397
We're a week away from the election,
Mr. Macallan.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.107
-Cover your tracks.
-[Aidan] Okay. In which case,

30:17.190 --> 30:23.113
I need to let hackers temporarily invade
a Capital East Telecom switching center.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.155
Meaning what?

30:24.239 --> 30:27.909
Well, the center covers
most of the US government cyber traffic.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.953
But if I'm in and out in 20 minutes,

30:30.036 --> 30:32.664
I think the damage will
look mischief-level.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.376
Messed-up connections, that sort of thing.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.669
-What if it takes you longer?
-Uh, it won't,

30:37.753 --> 30:39.963
because another ten, 20 minutes and...

30:40.922 --> 30:41.757
Do it.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.594
All right.
Well, I'll start it at 4:00 p.m.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.762
Uh, as soon as I'm done,

30:46.845 --> 30:49.681
I'll anonymously send out
a fix to the problem.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.475
-[Frank] No.
-Sir?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.977
LeAnn will contact you
about when to send out the fix.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.396
-You'll wait for her.
-Okay, but just to be--

30:55.479 --> 30:56.813
[Frank] She'll let you know.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.690
[door slams]

31:02.694 --> 31:03.695
Oh.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.033
[Claire] I just saw the Haines article.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.494
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.204
Yes.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.956
It was sloppy.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.459
Agreed. I'll talk to him.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.713
Are you all right?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.091
How was New York?

31:27.428 --> 31:28.845
My events went well.

31:32.849 --> 31:36.269
And? What aren't you telling me?

31:38.522 --> 31:40.982
I bumped into Ken Caswell.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.610
-Does he know any more?
-No, um...

31:44.528 --> 31:47.531
-Why didn't you call him back?
-What?

31:47.614 --> 31:50.033
His Treasury business.
The oversight legislation.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.994
I understand you don't care about it.
Fine.

31:53.078 --> 31:56.707
But you can't ignore loose ends like that.
You owed him your ear.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.544
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna
become so personal.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.254
I am the President of the United States,
for Christ's sake. I'm a bit busy.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.758
The past doesn't disappear
on command, Francis.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.885
Not even for presidents.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.262
What did he say to you?

32:12.639 --> 32:15.350
Ken's got a big mouth.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.905
I'm sorry about Tim. I'm sorry he's gone.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.950
I know how you felt about him.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.495
Or, I can imagine.

32:35.662 --> 32:36.997
Listen to me.

32:38.081 --> 32:42.043
You know you're the only person
I've ever truly loved.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.795
You know that, right?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.225
And listen.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.687
Something else is about to happen.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.158
[sighs heavily]

33:14.367 --> 33:15.368
[cell phone chimes]

33:17.078 --> 33:18.955
[computer processing]

33:26.963 --> 33:28.298
[beeping]

33:46.441 --> 33:47.442
[sighs]

33:49.110 --> 33:50.696
Welcome back.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.199
Reception is sketchy. Good trip?

33:54.282 --> 33:58.286
I just came back to get changed.
I need to get back to Francis.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.083
-You mad at me?
-[sighs]

34:04.125 --> 34:05.627
You shouldn't have said that.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.297
I know. I know we need to be careful.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.592
[sighs]

34:12.676 --> 34:16.804
[chuckles] Careful is far too small a word
for what we need to be.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.431
Okay.

34:22.603 --> 34:26.231
But don't you get tired of being
far bigger than careful all the time?

34:29.442 --> 34:31.570
[auditor 1] I don't know what's going on.
[auditor 2] Me neither.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.947
[auditor 3] Seems to be some kind of
network disturbance.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.616
[auditor 1] I lost connection
on my server.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.764
[processing]

35:02.851 --> 35:07.147
You know what I'm tired of?
This role. First Lady.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.024
'Cause it's never felt right.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.986
It's only eight more days
to the vice presidency.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.489
-Mmm-hmm. What's my role?
-What?

35:17.699 --> 35:21.411
What am I to you, anyway? Or you, to me?

35:23.038 --> 35:24.665
I mean, are you my girlfriend?

35:25.707 --> 35:27.250
And when you win...

35:28.168 --> 35:31.630
does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?

35:33.089 --> 35:34.841
First Concubine?

35:39.054 --> 35:41.597
About that article... I'm sorry.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.184
I hate apologies.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.858
I'm sorry.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.786
I looked over at you.
I watched you watching.

36:05.997 --> 36:09.250
-When?
-Did it even affect you?

36:09.334 --> 36:10.794
The beheading?

36:12.212 --> 36:15.841
-Why would you ask that?
-I had no sense of what you were thinking.

36:16.758 --> 36:17.843
None.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.595
Of what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.597
I was thinking, "Don't think."

36:27.560 --> 36:31.773
And I'll tell you something else.
I never said I like being careful.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.154
[driver] God damn it.
[Olmstead] What's wrong?

36:38.238 --> 36:40.949
The GPS thinks
we're back at the White House.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.995
-Did you reach the campaign office?
-Trying. I can't get a signal.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.788
Oh, wait. Here we go.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.791
I can't miss this flight.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.543
-[Tanya] It's ringing.
-Good.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.380
-How long do you think?
-Now it stopped.

36:55.463 --> 36:58.299
There's a pile-up on the highway.
I'm doing the best I can.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.387
[cell phone vibrating]

37:03.388 --> 37:04.555
Hello?

37:06.474 --> 37:07.559
Hello!

37:07.642 --> 37:09.227
[line beeping]

37:09.310 --> 37:11.897
-Tanya, let me try your phone.
-I'm having the same issues.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.150
-Can you get through to the office?
-No, Governor, I can't.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.360
Garrett is a good man.

37:17.443 --> 37:20.363
-A trustworthy man?
-Absolutely, Mr. Romero.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.740
And is he the kind of man

37:21.823 --> 37:24.492
who would knowingly participate
in campaign finance fraud?

37:24.575 --> 37:26.369
I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.039
How well do you know
President Underwood, sir?

37:29.790 --> 37:32.083
I've known the president four years.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.085
Isn't it a fact
that it was Francis Underwood

37:34.169 --> 37:36.797
and not President Walker who first
suggested you should resign?

37:41.509 --> 37:43.845
To the best of my recollection, no.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.140
And isn't it true that the source
of campaign funds you received

37:47.223 --> 37:48.641
as the president's running mate
was connected

37:48.724 --> 37:52.353
to a pay-for-play scheme that reached
all the way from Missouri to China?

37:53.313 --> 37:55.481
To the best of my knowledge, no.

37:55.565 --> 37:59.861
Did you receive any campaign donations
through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?

38:00.821 --> 38:02.697
Not to the best of my recollection.

38:02.781 --> 38:03.782
Do you think your recollection

38:03.865 --> 38:05.616
or knowledge will improve
as the day goes on?

38:05.700 --> 38:06.993
Excuse me?

38:07.077 --> 38:09.329
[cell phones chiming]

38:09.412 --> 38:11.247
[people murmuring]

38:18.296 --> 38:19.505
Beth.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.093
I want you to promise me
that you'll call me

38:23.176 --> 38:25.220
anytime you need anything.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.390
You were the love of Tim's life,
you know that.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.104
Well, I should probably...

38:36.940 --> 38:38.524
Yes. You, too.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.569
Goodbye.

38:44.614 --> 38:45.991
Thank you, Felix.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.034
Uh, would you like me
to prepare it for you, sir?

38:48.118 --> 38:50.036
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.838
[door opens, closes]

39:11.682 --> 39:16.187
The first question to ask yourself...
"Is the damper open?"

39:16.271 --> 39:19.900
Never allow yourself
to be overcome with smoke.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.528
Conflagration relies on airflow.
That's what the grate is for.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.406
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.

39:26.489 --> 39:30.243
It's helpful, but of course they clean up
around here too soon to do that.

39:30.326 --> 39:34.956
Now, as for the architecture of the logs,
I prefer the upside-down method.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.459
Largest logs right along the base.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.504
Then medium-size logs after that.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.218
Small logs.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.350
And then finally, kindling...

39:56.477 --> 39:57.728
and tinder.

39:57.812 --> 40:01.399
Now, of course, back home,
dead palmetto fronds are ideal.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.276
But, of course, here in Washington,

40:03.359 --> 40:06.446
we have to use whatever garbage
we find lying around.

40:07.488 --> 40:12.327
But then, if a man cannot use
what's right in...

40:17.748 --> 40:19.542
[softly] God damn it, Tim.

40:26.674 --> 40:30.845
If a man is not smart enough to be able
to use whatever is in front of him

40:30.929 --> 40:32.888
and still make it work...

40:33.974 --> 40:39.062
well, then...
that's just a failure of the imagination.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.487

It's coming up on everybody's phones.

[exhales heavily] Come on.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.132

-No.

Tom!

42:46.606 --> 42:48.858
[Frank] And, finally,
you strike your match...

42:49.734 --> 42:51.444
you ignite your kindling...

42:59.827 --> 43:01.746
and then you blow.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.038

43:10.546 --> 43:12.132

-[Olmstead] What?

43:42.328 --> 43:43.288
Maybe they were right.

43:43.371 --> 43:45.248
Maybe we should have said yes
to the offer of those troops.

43:45.331 --> 43:48.626
National Guard on patrol makes us look
weak right before an election. Forget it.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.753
-But, Governor--
-I made my decision, Tanya.

44:44.182 --> 44:47.101
They're patching through the heads
of all the carriers, sir.

44:47.185 --> 44:50.896
Gentlemen and ladies, can you hear me?

44:50.980 --> 44:52.273
<i>Yes, Mr. President.</i>

44:52.357 --> 44:55.610
Good. Then tell me how in God's name
this has happened.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.821
<i>Uh, we don't know yet, sir.</i>
<i>We're still working on the problem.</i>

44:58.904 --> 45:01.824
<i>We're reaching out</i>
<i>to as many people as we--</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:05.035
Did we just lose them?

45:05.953 --> 45:07.538
Is this a joke?

45:07.622 --> 45:08.831
[cell phone chimes]

45:53.876 --> 45:54.752
[chimes]

45:57.838 --> 45:59.256
[sighs]

46:01.426 --> 46:03.177
[telephone rings]

46:08.474 --> 46:11.101
[Doug] The Ohio governor is calling
from a payphone.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.609
[Frank over phone] <i>This is the president.</i>

46:18.693 --> 46:20.570
Mr. President, I've changed my mind.

46:20.653 --> 46:21.946
If the offer's still open,

46:22.029 --> 46:24.990
I'd like to accept additional troops
for the state of Ohio.

46:25.074 --> 46:27.868
<i>Just say the word, Roger.</i>
<i>Whatever you need.</i>

46:31.205 --> 46:34.917
My fellow Americans, the facts are these.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.212
<i>The greater District of Columbia area</i>
<i>and the immediate region beyond</i>

46:38.295 --> 46:41.799
<i>have undergone what we suspect is</i>
<i>an ICO-sponsored cyber-attack.</i>

46:41.882 --> 46:45.720
<i>The attack was aimed at the district's</i>
<i>main telecom switching center.</i>

46:45.803 --> 46:47.137
<i>In addition to intermittent outages,</i>

46:47.221 --> 46:49.932
<i>a considerable amount of havoc</i>
<i>has been wreaked.</i>

46:50.015 --> 46:54.186
<i>Traffic lights have been disabled.</i>
<i>One area train has been derailed.</i>

46:54.269 --> 46:57.565
<i>The system that maintains our sewers</i>
<i>has been tampered with.</i>

46:57.648 --> 46:59.817
<i>The perpetrators were</i>
<i>targeting the government</i>

46:59.900 --> 47:01.944
<i>and their ultimate purpose, though foiled,</i>

47:02.027 --> 47:05.865
was to disrupt all
mid-Atlantic transportation networks.

47:05.948 --> 47:09.619
Events like these underscore the urgency
of my request to Congress

47:09.702 --> 47:11.454
for a declaration of war.

47:11.537 --> 47:15.583
Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will
spend a dark night of the soul,

47:15.666 --> 47:19.879
after which they will reconsider
their paralysis and choose to act.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.547
<i>Capital East Telecom has informed me</i>

47:21.631 --> 47:24.049
<i>that it's repairing the network</i>
<i>as fast as possible,</i>

47:24.133 --> 47:27.762
<i>but that it will take at least</i>
<i>a couple more days to be fully restored.</i>

47:27.845 --> 47:30.431
<i>It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact</i>

47:30.515 --> 47:33.559
<i>that we will continue</i>
<i>to experience attacks until ICO</i>

47:33.643 --> 47:38.147
and other terrorist groups like it
are eliminated swiftly and completely.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.650
Thank you. May God bless you.

47:40.733 --> 47:43.235
And may God bless
the United States of America.

47:48.408 --> 47:50.117
[sighs]

47:50.200 --> 47:51.285
We off?

47:51.952 --> 47:53.370
[indistinct chatter]

47:59.502 --> 48:01.421
-Good evening, Ted.
-[Brockhart] Hi, Hannah.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.715
I saw your interview.

48:04.799 --> 48:08.719
[stutters] I'd appreciate it if you didn't
bring up the details of my combat record.

48:08.803 --> 48:11.514
You were a hero that day.
You should use it, Will.

48:18.187 --> 48:19.354
[reporter] Governor,
aren't you worried about

48:19.439 --> 48:22.232
bringing your kids out
in the middle of a terrorist attack?

48:22.316 --> 48:26.779
It'd be scarier to keep the kids at home.
The streets are safe. Life goes on.

48:26.862 --> 48:27.863
[chuckles]

48:30.658 --> 48:32.409
You've got to be kidding me.

48:33.536 --> 48:34.954
[soldiers speaking indistinctly]

48:37.206 --> 48:39.083
[reporter] What's on your mind, Governor?

48:43.378 --> 48:46.466
What's on my mind?
I mean, you see what's going on here.

48:47.216 --> 48:50.260
This is all him.
It's a man who's never served.

48:50.344 --> 48:53.097
<i>Wouldn't know what a real war was</i>
<i>if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.</i>

48:53.180 --> 48:54.849
<i>I mean, a declaration of war?</i>

48:55.766 --> 48:58.102
<i>He's putting American lives in danger.</i>

48:59.311 --> 49:00.980
<i>-War is real!</i>
-Nightcap?

49:01.063 --> 49:04.108
<i>-You don't screw around with it.</i>
-Why not?

49:05.485 --> 49:07.027
<i>This is what happens.</i>

49:07.111 --> 49:09.864
<i>This is what happens</i>
<i>when you throw around a word like "war."</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:11.323
<i>All hell breaks loose.</i>

49:11.406 --> 49:13.868
