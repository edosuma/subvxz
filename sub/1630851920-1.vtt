52:21.200 --> 52:22.280
I was curious

52:22.720 --> 52:24.800
what Lee Jong-tae would be like
once he saw you.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.880
So you wanted to know what he'd be like
once he saw the person who shot him?

52:28.560 --> 52:30.000
He recognizes his family,

52:30.800 --> 52:32.360
but I was wondering about others.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.160
That wasn't the only thing.

52:36.480 --> 52:38.040
His heart was beating slowly,

52:38.160 --> 52:39.920
he seemed to feel less pain,

52:40.840 --> 52:42.240
and his wounds healed quickly.

52:43.840 --> 52:46.200
It'll make a lot of money
if it can be controlled.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.120
Is that why
you're investigating it in secret?

52:54.120 --> 52:57.240
Though it's not highly contagious,
it will scare people.

52:57.320 --> 52:59.800
The degree of fatigue concerning
infectious diseases is already high.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.120
There's no reason to make a fuss.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.520
But why do you have
the air conditioner on?

53:12.960 --> 53:15.440
The outbreak of the disease slows down
under low temperatures.

53:21.680 --> 53:22.960
Is this also a test?

53:23.320 --> 53:25.120
To see if I'm thirsty or not.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.600
The test result showed
you're totally fine.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.200
But I'm not such a lucky person.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.200
Get some rest for the time being.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
You mean, here?

53:38.360 --> 53:40.640
No. Wherever you'd like.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.120
Are you sure? Is that allowed?

53:46.480 --> 53:48.240
It can be done if we say

53:48.600 --> 53:51.560
you were hurt physically and mentally
while serving our country.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.800
And we'll have to draw your blood
every two weeks.

53:55.480 --> 53:57.200
You're not exhibiting any symptoms yet,

53:57.720 --> 54:00.280
so you may already have antibodies.

54:04.000 --> 54:04.840
[Temporary Pass]

54:04.920 --> 54:05.720
[Important]

54:10.960 --> 54:13.000
I guess I'm kind of important.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.200
Do me one more favor.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.840
You said earlier
that I served my country well.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.600
Then I want the highest score
on my performance review for this year.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.480
Sorry?

54:28.720 --> 54:30.240
The public rental apartment in Seyang.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.840
They reserve a few units for the police.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.400
But it's a point system.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.160
Marital status, number of dependents,

54:35.280 --> 54:37.000
seniority, and performance review scores.

54:37.080 --> 54:38.080
They add it all up.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.960
I suppose you have that much influence.
Am I wrong?

54:45.480 --> 54:47.080
I think I could arrange that.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.440
You've been managing
a pretty good record anyway.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.200
I'm the best.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.320
I was born to prevent
and fight terrorist attacks.

54:57.080 --> 55:00.120
I'm glad we're on the same page.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.680
We don't shake hands anymore.

55:04.760 --> 55:05.960
No, my phone.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.240
Do you not serve breakfast here?
That's so petty.

55:22.760 --> 55:24.960
Thank you. I'll go home and savor this.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.800
Do you have a boyfriend?

55:36.160 --> 55:38.000
I don't dislike you,

55:38.640 --> 55:40.560
but the age gap is too big.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.120
The highest performance evaluation score
won't be enough.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.640
You'll need more points.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.280
Do you have plans to get married soon?

55:47.560 --> 55:50.480
Plans? I'll start planning now.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.080
Are you not worried?

55:53.440 --> 55:55.280
I'll get one of the apartment units,
no matter what.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.320
So you don't need to worry about that.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.840
I'm talking about what you saw
yesterday and today.

56:00.760 --> 56:01.760
If things go wrong,

56:02.280 --> 56:04.760
the world we knew up until yesterday
could collapse.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.920
Will something change if I worry?

56:09.720 --> 56:11.120
The world might not collapse after all.

56:25.520 --> 56:26.520
Ma'am.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.640
Where are my clothes?

56:30.480 --> 56:31.840
We burned them.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.080
I see.

56:34.520 --> 56:35.880
Then do I have to go home like this?

56:39.120 --> 56:40.840
Sae-bom! Hey.

56:41.280 --> 56:42.760
Are you all right? Let me see.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.400
You still don't trust me.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.360
My feelings are actually hurt.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.000
I'm fine. I can go home.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.840
I'm sorry for getting you into this.

57:02.760 --> 57:03.960
Your face looks gaunt.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.440
Really?
It's because I didn't have any breakfast.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.640
By the way, how did you get in here?

57:10.280 --> 57:11.880
Did they bring you in?
Were you bitten too?

57:11.960 --> 57:14.520
No, I came to save you.

57:16.560 --> 57:18.920
Wait here.
I have to go talk to someone quickly.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
Impressive.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.640
Looks like you could play baseball again.

57:48.840 --> 57:49.840
Is this

57:50.560 --> 57:51.640
that pill?

57:51.720 --> 57:55.800
That's right.
Apparently, it's a failed pneumonia cure.

57:55.960 --> 57:58.160
Tons of people have taken it,

57:58.960 --> 58:00.480
so it couldn't have caused the madness.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.120
But I promised I'd find it,
so there you go.

58:03.720 --> 58:05.200
Just because it was fine yesterday,

58:06.280 --> 58:08.160
it doesn't mean it'll still be fine today.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.040
I'll be off, then.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.200
Let's go. I'll take you home.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.880
Yes. He was right next to me all along.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Yi-hyun.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.760
Are you seeing anyone by any chance?

59:06.320 --> 59:07.360
What? That's so random.

59:07.440 --> 59:08.920
-Are you?
-No.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.760
Do you snore
or grind your teeth in your sleep?

59:11.200 --> 59:12.240
I don't think so.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.600
Then how about we get married?

59:15.960 --> 59:19.600
Yi-hyun. Tell him you don't want me
to be punished.

59:20.240 --> 59:21.440
He wants to arrest me.

59:21.560 --> 59:22.640
Hey, Sae-bom.

59:25.840 --> 59:26.880
Want to go out?

59:32.040 --> 59:33.040
No.

59:35.520 --> 59:39.000
Hey, I told you that day
that I was only joking.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.360
I'm not joking.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.440
I mean it.

59:54.680 --> 59:59.440
[Happiness]

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:26.560
[If people suddenly start going crazy...]

1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:25.880
[Missed Call: Wife]

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:30.160
You asked me to gather intel
on Han Tae-seok.

1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:33.680
[I really can't stand that guy.]

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:35.800
I own a home now.

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.920
[It's locked. The units on this floor
and below are public rental units,]

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.880
[The ones on the upper floors
are for general sales.]

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:40.760
[We welcome all new residents.]

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:42.920
[A reporter called me.]

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:44.880
There is a way

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.880
[-to make money and stay safe.]
-Lee Seung-young!

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.600
[There's a problem at the dormitory.]

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:50.840
Where are the critically-ill patients?

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.160
[But they're alive.]

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:55.360
[If we stall, more people will be hurt.]
