This book was written
by somebody I trust.

-Jimmy Dale.
-Oh, hey, Nova.
Good to see you again.

What'’s he talking about?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.140
Did she write about
our past?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.360
-You gonna show your face
in our house?
-I ain'’t the one, boy.

No! You'’re gonna
kill him!

There are things goin'’ on
that shouldn'’t be, Charley.

Keke ain'’t even answering
my texts lately.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.780
Seems like I can'’t
do anything right.

Are you sure you'’re up
to doing this?

00:50.700 --> 00:53.090
I don'’t want to cause problems
between you and your mom.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.530
It'’s all good.

00:54.570 --> 00:56.310
The drive up will give
me time to think

00:56.360 --> 01:00.230
about what I'’m doing
with my life.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.280
There'’s been a lot
going on since...

01:04.150 --> 01:05.800

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

01:07.850 --> 01:10.150

with my life right now either.

-I hope they do.
-I don'’t know why they think

01:34.830 --> 01:36.740
the silent treatment
is going to solve anything.

01:36.790 --> 01:42.100
There was a lot of anger
in the moment, but it'’ll pass.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.320
I don'’t know.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.100
It'’s like when my
mom and dad broke up,

01:47.150 --> 01:48.580
I didn'’t think
that we would get

01:48.630 --> 01:50.150

in the same room again.

It'’s the same

01:55.240 --> 01:57.630
All I can do is let
everybody know I love them

01:57.680 --> 02:00.420
and how important
they are to me.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.210

11:17.500 --> 11:18.930
Am I reading this right?

11:18.980 --> 11:22.850
This route guts most
of the black farmers'’ land.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.640
It guts our land.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.900
I should have known.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.950
[hip-hop music playing]

11:33.990 --> 11:35.730
[Ralph Angel, over phone]
This is Ralph Angel.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.300
Can'’t get to my phone
right now.

11:37.340 --> 11:38.910
-Leave a message.
-[answering machine beeps]

11:38.950 --> 11:41.960
I leave in two days,
Ralph Angel.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.830
Please call me back.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.700
I love you.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.150
[sighs]

11:56.190 --> 11:57.760
[cell phone rings]

12:01.890 --> 12:03.810
[cell phone beeps]

12:05.200 --> 12:07.810
Hey, Deborah.
How are things going?

12:07.850 --> 12:09.380
[Deborah, on phone]
Are you sitting down?

12:09.420 --> 12:12.250
Yes, I'’m sitting.
What'’s up?

12:12.290 --> 12:14.340
That glowing
New York Times review,

12:14.380 --> 12:16.860
it'’s now a six-week
national tour.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.860
Six weeks? Seriously?

12:18.910 --> 12:20.000
First stop: Houston.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.870
Then the Big Apple, Nova.

12:21.910 --> 12:24.090
Boston, Chicago,

12:24.130 --> 12:26.520
San Francisco and Atlanta.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.400
Are you still there?

12:30.400 --> 12:33.270
Yes. I'’m here.

12:33.310 --> 12:35.230
Give me a minute.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.620
[sighs]

12:37.660 --> 12:39.800
All this from
the Timesreview?

12:39.840 --> 12:42.710
Yes, Miss
Soon-to-be-Bestselling-Author.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.240
Wow.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.890
A national tour
for a debut book.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.810
Deborah, I just don'’t
have the words.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.940
Thank you.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.250
This is wonderful.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.470
Enjoy the moment, Nova.
See you soon.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.860
Yes. See you soon.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.130
[phone beeps off]

13:09.090 --> 13:10.390
Wow.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.440
You have been working
real hard this morning.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.490
And I appreciate it.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.060
Now you go take a break

13:21.100 --> 13:23.010
before the lunch hour gets here.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.370
[man] No, no, I didn'’t marry her
for her cooking.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.330
[man laughs]

13:36.380 --> 13:39.600
In the beginning, I was the only
cook in the house.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.860
[laughs]

13:42.380 --> 13:46.080
But she didn'’t like that,
mm-mm, no.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.520
So she learned.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.610
[continues indistinct]

13:53.780 --> 13:56.870
Man, I tell you,
that'’s what love will do.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.440
Hey, hey.
Hey, Vi, am I right?

14:00.490 --> 14:03.880
My Clare learned to cook
almost as good as you.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.150
Good enough to make him
a stranger at the High Yellow.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.410
We couldn'’t compete.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.450
Yeah. I...

14:11.500 --> 14:13.630
I miss that woman.

14:22.990 --> 14:25.080
See y'’all later.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.250
Take care of yourself, baby.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.260
Thank you for meeting me.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.740
Not a problem.

14:31.780 --> 14:33.910
So you'’ve heard the news?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.610
About Jacob running
for your city council seat?

14:36.650 --> 14:38.520
I swear, these people.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.350
It was a hard decision
to step down.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.620
Wait, you'’re...

14:45.310 --> 14:47.450
Isabel, please don'’t.

14:47.490 --> 14:50.360
Hold your seat.
Help me stop this highway.

14:50.410 --> 14:53.800
It'’s just not worth
running up against

14:53.840 --> 14:55.890
Jacob Boudreaux
and that family.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.240
We could have formed
a coalition.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.150
I will fully support
your campaign.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.630
You'’re barking up
the wrong tree, Charley.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.030
I'’m stepping down because
I know a brick wall coming at me

15:03.070 --> 15:07.730
when I see one.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.990
You didn'’t choose this.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.130
They got to you somehow,
didn'’t they?

15:14.170 --> 15:16.780
That highway
can'’t be stopped.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.740
There'’s too many deep pockets
that want to get deeper

15:19.780 --> 15:21.870
that are fully invested
in ensuring that it happens.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.180
That'’s what they said about
the prison, but we stopped that.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.180
The prison was a state project.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.140
The highway is federal.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.140
It involves more money

15:30.190 --> 15:32.060
and more stakeholders
who are willing

15:32.100 --> 15:34.710
to sell their mother down
the river to see this happen.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.840
Why do you think the Landrys
let go of the prison so easily?

15:37.890 --> 15:41.020
They already had a backup plan
to cash out.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.200
A bigger plan.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.030
The prison fight didn'’t
seem easy to me.

15:44.070 --> 15:48.160
It'’ll seem like child's play
if you try to stop this highway.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.250
We can do this.
Together.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.120
Form a solid,
grassroots campaign.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.170
[speaks Spanish]

15:54.210 --> 15:55.560
Choose your battles,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.520
and know when to throw
in the towel.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.430
We can'’t win them all.

16:04.650 --> 16:06.570
[laughter and chattering]

16:11.700 --> 16:13.790
[cell phone chimes]

16:26.240 --> 16:28.200
Charley, good to see you.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.640
And you.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.250
Good to have you back
in town, Frances.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.990
Aw.

16:34.470 --> 16:37.510
I took the liberty
of ordering for you.

16:39.430 --> 16:42.610
-No, thank you.
-All right.

16:43.690 --> 16:45.830
I don'’t appreciate
being handled.

16:45.870 --> 16:48.480
The board minutes
I'’ve received are a farce.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.270
A smoke screen.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.530
If there was an error,

16:51.570 --> 16:53.090
I'’m sure it was
a clerical oversight.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.450
Omitting your highway proposal
to gut St. Jo

16:56.490 --> 17:00.540
and take over half of Bordelon
land is not an oversight.

17:00.580 --> 17:04.410
Please stop taking
everything personally.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.720
My family is losing
land as well--

17:06.760 --> 17:10.240
In exchange for a lucrative
business enterprise.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.070
And, as a Landry shareholder,
you will profit too.

17:13.110 --> 17:17.250
Land is the only thing
God is not making any more of,

17:17.290 --> 17:20.730
so it'’s a blood sport.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.600
And you know it.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.780
Which is why I will not
see my family

17:24.820 --> 17:27.080
and the black farmers
of St. Jo

17:27.130 --> 17:29.040
thrown away like trash.

17:30.610 --> 17:33.790
You know, 40 years ago
you'’d be lucky

17:33.830 --> 17:36.790
to be allowed to clean
toilets here.

17:36.830 --> 17:40.580
And yet, you just walked
across these grounds like...

17:40.620 --> 17:43.490
like you own the damn place.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.450
You'’re not one of them.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.630
I read your sister'’s book.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.200
You...

17:58.770 --> 18:00.200
conquered the league

18:00.250 --> 18:05.860
and turned a basketball player
into an empire.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.260
[laughs]

18:08.600 --> 18:13.130
Only a stone-cold capitalist
knows how to do that.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.790
We'’re more alike than not.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.920
You think my sister'’s
sentimental drivel

18:19.960 --> 18:25.270
has given you insight into
who I am and what I'’ve done?

18:26.270 --> 18:28.100
You don'’t know the half.

18:29.450 --> 18:31.800
So let me fill you in.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.150
You wouldn'’t make it
one day in Hollywood

18:36.200 --> 18:38.420
or professional basketball.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.380
And, as you said,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.900
I conquered them both.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.380
So, what do you think
I'’m going to do to Jacob

18:45.420 --> 18:48.690
when he tries to run
for office for you?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.170
Yeah.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.560
Yeah, I know about that too.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.100
I really appreciate you
getting me all this,

19:12.150 --> 19:14.580
but why not just make
me a playlist?

19:14.630 --> 19:16.320
-Playlist?
-Yeah.

19:16.370 --> 19:18.370
-[laughs] Are you serious?
-Current times.

19:18.410 --> 19:20.240
Yeah, you'’re clearly
not a musician.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.770
Digital just can'’t capture
the full sound like vinyl.

19:23.810 --> 19:25.290
-Hmm.
-You know?

19:25.330 --> 19:28.510
Music deserves a fully
immersive experience.

19:28.550 --> 19:30.900
You got to let yourself
be transported.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.780
Vinyl is the key.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.300
Okay, okay. I got it.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.040
We will test this theory
when you'’re finished.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.170
Okay. I'’m telling you.

19:39.220 --> 19:43.570
When the needle hits the groove,
ooh-wee, it'’s like magic.

19:43.610 --> 19:45.220
You'’ll see.

19:45.270 --> 19:46.750
Voilà.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.920
-[soul music playing]
-Turntable for my lady.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.640
-[engine idling loudly]
-Turn it off.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.510
-Huh?
-Turn it off. Quick.

20:08.550 --> 20:11.290
There you go.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.860
Now stop right here.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.340
-[turns engine off]
-That'’s how you do it.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.510
Pop! Mr. Benny
let me hold the wheel,

20:16.560 --> 20:18.340
and it'’s like
riding a dragon.

20:18.390 --> 20:20.300
What you know about
riding a dragon, huh?

20:20.340 --> 20:21.910
I know everything
about dragons.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.480
[chuckles]
Go inside.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.870
Get some lemonade.

20:24.910 --> 20:26.260
-Let me talk to Mr. Benny.
-All right.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.570
-I'’ll be back.
-Come on, player.

20:27.610 --> 20:28.830
There you go.

20:28.870 --> 20:30.620
Go wash your hands.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.660
-[Blue] I will.
-Nasty!

20:32.700 --> 20:34.270
[sighs]

20:34.320 --> 20:35.620
Tell me what you think.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.450
This thing going to work?

20:37.490 --> 20:39.280
I think so.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.500
Feel good helping out
our people, huh?

20:41.540 --> 20:43.240
It does.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.020
And I appreciate
you helping me out.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.630
Man, ain'’t no thing.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.330
You know I got you.

20:49.370 --> 20:50.770
Hey, man...

20:52.330 --> 20:54.550
you mind if I ask you
something personal?

20:54.600 --> 20:56.380
[scoffs]

20:56.420 --> 20:58.340
What'’s up?

20:58.380 --> 21:01.300
I don'’t mean to get into your
business or nothing like that,

21:01.340 --> 21:03.910
but is it true what I'’m hearing
about, you know, you and Blue?

21:03.950 --> 21:05.740
Man, what you hear?

21:07.350 --> 21:11.440
Listen, I ain'’t mean
no harm by what I'’m saying.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.180
Just want to give props to
you for being a father to Blue.

21:14.220 --> 21:16.010
My biological never
stepped up for me

21:16.050 --> 21:17.400
the way you do
for your son.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.800
That'’s all I'm saying.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.320
I'’m proud to be working
for a brother

21:23.360 --> 21:25.020
doing the right thing.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.330
Nothing but respect, man.

21:29.410 --> 21:32.290
-Keep it up.
-Appreciate that.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.900

Micah!

21:50.610 --> 21:51.740
It'’s your dad!

21:51.780 --> 21:53.700
[footsteps rushing]

21:58.140 --> 21:59.700
-Hey.
-What'’s up?

21:59.750 --> 22:01.530
Hey.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.790
Come on in.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.320
-Hi.
-Hey.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.150
Oh. Hey, Charley.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.070
Micah didn'’t mention
you were home.

22:15.110 --> 22:17.850
Yeah, I didn'’t...
I didn'’t hear you come in.

22:20.900 --> 22:23.380
Yeah, um...

22:23.420 --> 22:26.470
Well, I said I had
a surprise for you.

22:26.510 --> 22:30.470
Let me introduce
you to my daughter...

22:30.520 --> 22:32.740
Tia.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.440
Micah'’s sister.

22:40.570 --> 22:43.970
Well, this is a surprise.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.800
Tia?

22:48.140 --> 22:49.840
What a pretty name.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.500
Thank you.

22:51.540 --> 22:52.670
I like your name too.

22:52.710 --> 22:56.460
Well, it'’s a nickname
for Charlotte.

22:59.850 --> 23:02.250
So, Micah...

23:03.640 --> 23:06.510
now that you'’ve met your sister,

23:06.550 --> 23:11.650
perhaps you two could get
to know each other better.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.260
Yeah.

23:16.650 --> 23:18.300
Yeah.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.180
Charley, we'’re planning
breakfast together.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.660
You know, how about
if you joined us?

23:23.700 --> 23:24.960
You know?

23:25.010 --> 23:28.620
Have a nice
family gathering, and...

23:28.660 --> 23:32.100
and I can tell you about
some news I need to share.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.450
I think you'’ve
shared enough, Davis.

23:37.540 --> 23:39.020
Tia, let'’s...

23:39.060 --> 23:41.590
you want to grab
a soda?

23:41.630 --> 23:43.370
Go ahead. It'’s fine.

24:01.130 --> 24:05.310
I don'’t know what
your news is, Davis...

24:05.350 --> 24:09.620
but I will not be whatever
it is you want me to be.

24:09.660 --> 24:12.970
Some kind of surrogate
mom for that child.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.230
Okay, I get that.

24:15.270 --> 24:18.500
But, Charley, you'’re going
to have to face the truth.

24:18.540 --> 24:22.540
That child is innocent
and here to stay.

24:22.590 --> 24:23.890
I know that.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.070
What I wanted to tell you

24:26.110 --> 24:28.850
is that I'’m retiring
from playing basketball.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.470
I'’m taking the head coaching job
at Bayou State University,

24:32.510 --> 24:33.680
and it'’ll be
announced soon, so--

24:33.730 --> 24:35.600
Good for you.

24:35.640 --> 24:40.740
Tia will be welcome
here anytime

24:40.780 --> 24:42.390
to visit Micah.

24:42.430 --> 24:46.180
But I won'’t be back-doored
into raising your kid, Davis.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.530
This is on you.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.570
You kept this secret
for 13 years.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.620
You laid
with Tia'’s mom.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.710
You led a double life.
Not me.

24:56.750 --> 24:57.710
So this, all this,

24:57.750 --> 24:59.060
is your responsibility.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.060
Right, she is Micah'’s sister.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.890
Yes, I know
how biology works.

with your children, Davis.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.810

25:14.860 --> 25:17.990

that poor girl.

25:46.930 --> 25:48.670
Thank you.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.760
I am happy to share this work
of uncompromising love.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.330
What I will be reading today

25:54.370 --> 25:57.680
is actually a last-minute
addition to the book.

25:57.730 --> 26:02.030
I wasn'’t sure if I was
brave enough to include it.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.770
Still not.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.990
It asks tough questions
about what good people

26:06.040 --> 26:07.600
have to do in order
to carve out

26:07.650 --> 26:10.390
a safe place
in a dangerous world.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.440
From the chapter
"Buried Memories."

26:18.790 --> 26:21.620
"I loved my father
beyond measure,

26:21.660 --> 26:24.620
and I learned to love
whatever he loved,

26:24.670 --> 26:29.370
so any time we spent together
would become glorious time.

26:29.410 --> 26:31.190
Often that meant
just the two of us,

26:31.240 --> 26:33.630
at the lake.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.330
This one morning,
we went to get bait

26:35.370 --> 26:37.550
at a gas station
near Lake Verret.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.900
I waited in the truck
in eager anticipation

26:39.940 --> 26:41.640
of our day.

26:41.680 --> 26:45.820
But when my father returned,
he didn'’t have any bait.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.820
But he did have a busted lip

26:47.860 --> 26:52.210
and a look of anger
and humiliation on his face.

26:53.870 --> 26:57.180
I saw three white men smiling.

26:57.220 --> 26:59.180
I didn'’t get it then.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.700
But as an adult,

27:00.740 --> 27:04.840
I now understand the veiled
catcalls they uttered that day.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.880
They were threats
of sexual violence,

27:07.930 --> 27:10.450
of what they planned
to do to me,

27:10.490 --> 27:12.190
a 10-year-old black girl,

27:12.230 --> 27:15.020
when her father wasn'’t around.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.370
Daddy kept a close watch
over me after that.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.980
But I had a secret.

27:24.380 --> 27:26.810
I liked to wander
through the cane at night.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.510
I loved the richness
of the land.

27:29.560 --> 27:34.000
It was me alone
and safe in my world.

27:35.870 --> 27:39.130
It was about a week after
that aborted fishing trip.

27:39.170 --> 27:41.440
I was out in the night
and saw Daddy

27:41.480 --> 27:43.350
digging a deep hole
in the field.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.700
I couldn'’t tell
what was happening,

27:46.750 --> 27:49.530
until he pushed
a dark mound of something

27:49.580 --> 27:51.400
I couldn'’t quite see
into the hole

27:51.450 --> 27:55.020
and began to shovel
the land back in place.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.410
Daddy never saw
me standing watch,

27:58.450 --> 28:02.850
and I never asked
him about that night.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.290
I was too scared to know

28:04.330 --> 28:06.420
what it might have been.

28:08.860 --> 28:10.550
That was the last time

28:10.600 --> 28:13.470
I went out into
the cane at night.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.130
My natural connection
to the land,

28:17.170 --> 28:19.130
my birthright,

28:19.170 --> 28:21.000
was buried
with whatever my father

28:21.040 --> 28:23.090
put in the earth.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.660
All I know for sure is

28:26.700 --> 28:29.700
I never saw
those white men again.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.920
And my daddy never again

28:34.800 --> 28:36.450
took me fishing."

I wasn'’t expecting
to see you. Wow.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.750
Aww.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.750
I'’m really happy
to see you.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.140
I'’m really glad
you came.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.710
Of course.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.580
I wouldn'’t have missed
this for the world.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.980
I know, just because things
didn'’t work out between us

29:25.020 --> 29:28.460
doesn'’t mean that I'm not
still happy for you, Nova.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.330
And I am. Your words
are so beautiful,

29:31.370 --> 29:32.940
and they are so powerful.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.030
I'’m so proud of you.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.640
That means a lot to me.

working on myself,

29:45.340 --> 29:46.910
so I'’m able to say that now.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.430
[both laugh]

29:49.480 --> 29:52.090
I mean, we all got
to grow, right?

29:52.130 --> 29:53.960
Right. It'’s hard, though.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.790
Oh, but it'’s so worth it.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.440
Indeed.

29:57.490 --> 29:58.880
So, listen,
did you come alone?

29:58.920 --> 30:01.360
I didn'’t see
your family.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.970
Are you good?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.890
My nephew Micah is here.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.970

30:07.020 --> 30:08.930
Just complicated.

a little company later,

How could you write
about my past?

Let'’s talk. I did things
differently with you.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.370
I didn'’t use your name and
changed identifying information.

the world?

Anyone in St. Jo
with half a brain

31:45.160 --> 31:47.070
will figure out that
you are talking about me.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.950
This will expose my old life
to my new world.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.040
I really took pains
to protect you, Darla.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.950
And if someone does
find out, think about it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.430
Your story of resilience,
strength, and honesty

31:58.480 --> 31:59.610
is one to be proud of.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.780
This will destroy the life

so hard to build.

would understand.

32:09.790 --> 32:11.530
Why me of all people?

32:11.580 --> 32:13.580
Because you told Ralph Angel
the truth about Blue,

32:13.620 --> 32:15.930
despite the pain
you knew it would cause.

32:15.970 --> 32:18.110

36:04.550 --> 36:06.640
Early flight tomorrow.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.200
Thanks, Chantal.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.900
[drops phone]

36:12.950 --> 36:15.950
[sighs]

36:15.990 --> 36:21.170
I thought we agreed
to leave Nova alone.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.740
What makes you think
I need to hear anything

36:22.780 --> 36:24.000
that girl has to say?

36:24.050 --> 36:25.700
Because it'’s about Daddy.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.190
Micah heard Nova read a story
at the book launch tonight

36:33.230 --> 36:35.360
that wasn'’t in the copy
that she gave us.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.890
It'’s about a fishing trip.

36:38.930 --> 36:42.240
They were hassled
by some white men.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.720
I don'’t need to hear this.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.200
Aunt Vi...

36:46.330 --> 36:48.510
what do you know?

36:48.550 --> 36:51.160
I don'’t know nothing...

36:51.200 --> 36:52.600
except God don'’t like ugly.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.250
And he don'’t need
my help, yours,

36:55.300 --> 36:58.120
or Ernest'’s to
take care of business.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.910
Okay, what do you suspect?

37:03.300 --> 37:04.960
Lord have mercy.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.000
[sighs]

37:07.050 --> 37:09.180
I never knew for sure,

37:09.220 --> 37:10.920
but I suspect

37:10.960 --> 37:14.840
that something happened
to those wretched men.

37:16.050 --> 37:17.930
You saying Daddy
did something to them?

37:17.970 --> 37:21.360
Or somebody else
they hurt or did wrong.

37:21.410 --> 37:24.450
And you never
said anything?

37:24.500 --> 37:28.240
Why y'’all think you need
to know every damn thing?

37:29.550 --> 37:30.500
Just like Nova.

37:30.550 --> 37:32.940
Think you got a right

37:32.980 --> 37:34.550
to what everybody holds
in their soul?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.290
You don'’t.

37:39.250 --> 37:42.600
All I know is,
is that after that fishing trip,

37:42.650 --> 37:47.700
Ernest wouldn'’t take his eyes
off Nova, he was so worried.

37:49.090 --> 37:51.260
Then one day he wasn'’t
worried no more.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.310
Do I think that my brother
carried a burden to his grave?

37:56.360 --> 37:57.750
Yes.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.450
Do I know what it was
for sure?

38:01.490 --> 38:02.800
No.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.490
And I don'’t want to know.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.370
Yeah, well, maybe he didn'’t need
to carry all that alone.

38:07.410 --> 38:11.410
Maybe he wanted
to carry it alone.

38:14.030 --> 38:17.330
Not all dark corners
need light.

38:21.510 --> 38:25.690
Sometimes I think that
Jimmy Dale is my dark corner.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.430
Maybe this was your daddy'’s.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.040
Way I see it,

38:31.090 --> 38:33.000
as long as you ain'’t
hurting nobody,

38:33.040 --> 38:35.260
everybody got a right

38:35.310 --> 38:39.400
to keep some things
between themselves and God.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.580
You need something
to be able to talk about

38:44.620 --> 38:46.410
on judgment day.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.850
[sniffling and sobbing]

39:17.650 --> 39:19.400
She wrote about it.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.010
