WEBVTT

00:33.033 --> 00:34.300
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.366 --> 00:35.400
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:35.466 --> 00:36.066
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.133 --> 00:36.633
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.700 --> 00:38.166
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.266
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.433
RUSSIA'S STILL BRUTALIZING

00:41.500 --> 00:42.666
UKRAINE, AMAZON WORKERS IN THE

00:42.733 --> 00:44.566
U.S. UNIONIZED FOR THE FIRST

00:44.633 --> 00:47.200
TIME, AND AT THE OSCARS,

00:47.266 --> 00:48.900
THIS HAPPENED, A MOMENT THAT'S

00:48.966 --> 00:50.100
SINCE SPAWNED THOUSANDS OF

00:50.166 --> 00:53.633
TERRIBLE TAKES, WITH THIS BEING

00:53.700 --> 00:54.200
THE ONE WE MAY'VE NEEDED THE

00:54.266 --> 00:55.033
LEAST.

00:55.100 --> 00:55.833
>> THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN

00:55.900 --> 00:56.400
GETTING IS WILL SMITH

00:56.466 --> 00:58.466
AND CHRIS ROCK.

00:58.533 --> 00:58.733
HEY, LOOK.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.733
IT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.233
I THINK WILL WAS WRONG.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.666
LOOK, I UNDERSTOOD THE FEELING.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.600
NOPE.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.033
NOT YOU, O.J.

01:09.100 --> 01:09.800
NOT YOU.

01:09.866 --> 01:10.866
NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR FROM YOU ON

01:10.933 --> 01:12.100
THIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEEM

01:12.166 --> 01:13.433
TO BE COMING LIVE FROM THE COVID

01:13.500 --> 01:15.566
PATIO OF A SEÃ‘OR FROGS.

01:15.633 --> 01:16.866
YOU CAN SIT THIS ONE OUT.

01:16.933 --> 01:17.733
THINK OF THIS SITUATION LIKE A

01:17.800 --> 01:18.466
ROWDY BACHELORETTE ORDERING

01:18.533 --> 01:20.166
A MIMOSA.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.733
WE WANT AS LITTLE JUICE INVOLVED

01:21.800 --> 01:24.166
HERE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

01:24.233 --> 01:24.933
BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO

01:25.000 --> 01:25.800
WASHINGTON, WHERE REPUBLICANS

01:25.866 --> 01:26.900
HAD A DRAMATIC WEEK, THANKS TO

01:26.966 --> 01:28.133
MADISON CAWTHORN, THE FRESHMAN

01:28.200 --> 01:29.366
CONGRESSMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA,

01:29.433 --> 01:30.533
AND THE FALLOUT FROM THIS

01:30.600 --> 01:32.000
INTERVIEW.

01:32.066 --> 01:32.966
>> I LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE,

01:33.033 --> 01:33.933
A LOT OF THEM THAT I'VE LOOKED

01:34.000 --> 01:34.833
UP TO THROUGH MY LIFE,

01:34.900 --> 01:35.366
I'VE ALWAYS PAID ATTENTION

01:35.433 --> 01:36.533
TO POLITICS,

01:36.600 --> 01:38.400
GUYS THAT, YOU KNOW, THEN ALL OF

01:38.466 --> 01:39.766
A SUDDEN YOU GET INVITED TO

01:39.833 --> 01:41.066
"WELL, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:41.133 --> 01:42.666
A SEXUAL GET-TOGETHER AT ONE OF

01:42.733 --> 01:44.933
OUR HOMES, YOU SHOULD COME."

01:45.000 --> 01:45.700
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT DID YOU JUST

01:45.766 --> 01:47.266
ASK ME TO COME TO?"

01:47.333 --> 01:48.166
AND THEN YOU REALIZE THEY'RE

01:48.233 --> 01:49.600
ASKING YOU TO COME TO AN ORGY.

01:49.666 --> 01:50.733
OR THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME

01:50.800 --> 01:52.866
OF THE PEOPLE LEADING ON THE

01:52.933 --> 01:54.766
MOVEMENT TO TRY AND REMOVE

01:54.833 --> 01:56.266
ADDICTION IN OUR COUNTRY, AND

01:56.333 --> 01:57.166
THEN YOU WATCH THEM DO A KEY

01:57.233 --> 01:57.800
BUMP OF COCAINE RIGHT IN FRONT

01:57.866 --> 01:58.466
OF YOU.

01:58.533 --> 01:59.866
AND IT'S LIKE, THIS IS,

01:59.933 --> 02:01.766
THIS IS WILD.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.266
OBVIOUSLY NO ONE USES

02:03.333 --> 02:04.800
THE PHRASE "KEY BUMP" WITHOUT

02:04.866 --> 02:09.366
KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS,

02:09.433 --> 02:11.033
SO IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY

02:11.100 --> 02:11.633
TELLING ON YOURSELF A LITTLE.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.366
ALSO, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

02:12.433 --> 02:13.200
PEOPLE HAVING COKE FUELED ORGIES

02:13.266 --> 02:13.833
DON'T CALL THEM

02:13.900 --> 02:14.666
"SEXUAL GET-TOGETHERS."

02:14.733 --> 02:15.866
A "SEXUAL GET-TOGETHER"

02:15.933 --> 02:17.066
SOUNDS LIKE A SEX TOY PARTY

02:17.133 --> 02:18.000
AT YOUR FRIEND BRENDA'S FRIEND

02:18.066 --> 02:19.900
SHENAE'S HOUSE, WHERE YOU

02:19.966 --> 02:22.566
REALIZE HALFWAY THROUGH THAT

02:22.633 --> 02:23.233
THE WHOLE THING IS A PYRAMID

02:23.300 --> 02:24.666
SCHEME.

02:24.733 --> 02:25.300
"NO, I DON'T WANT TO SAMPLE ANY

02:25.366 --> 02:25.866
MORE RASPBERRY NIPPLE CREAM.

02:25.933 --> 02:26.266
THIS IS A SCAM

02:26.333 --> 02:28.566
AND I'M GOING HOME.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.933
I GOT A BABYSITTER FOR THIS!"

02:30.000 --> 02:31.066
ALSO -- AND THIS REALLY

02:31.133 --> 02:31.966
ISN'T THE POINT,

02:32.033 --> 02:33.433
BUT WHAT IS THIS PODCAST?

02:33.500 --> 02:35.966
THAT'S RHETORICAL.

02:36.033 --> 02:36.700
I DON'T CARE AND I WON'T LEARN.

02:36.766 --> 02:37.900
I JUST THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT THE

02:37.966 --> 02:38.833
ONLY TWO CLUES WE HAVE ARE

02:38.900 --> 02:39.533
A BRAVEHEART POSTER AND WHAT

02:39.600 --> 02:40.733
APPEARS TO BE A RAG DOLL

02:40.800 --> 02:45.000
OF POST MALONE.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.300
NOW, CAWTHORN'S REMARKS PROMPTED

02:47.366 --> 02:48.400
STERN REBUKES FROM HIS

02:48.466 --> 02:49.100
COLLEAGUES, WITH HOUSE MINORITY

02:49.166 --> 02:49.833
LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY SAYING,

02:49.900 --> 02:50.633
"THERE'S NO EVIDENCE BEHIND HIS

02:50.700 --> 02:51.166
STATEMENTS...

02:51.233 --> 02:54.366
HE'S LOST MY TRUST, AND HE'S

02:54.433 --> 02:55.533
GOING TO HAVE TO EARN IT BACK.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.333
AND IF THAT TRULY WAS THE MOMENT

02:56.400 --> 02:57.700
WHEN CAWTHORN LOST MCCARTHY'S

02:57.766 --> 02:58.100
TRUST, THEN LET'S

02:58.166 --> 03:01.000
TAKE A MINUTE ON THAT.

03:01.066 --> 03:01.933
BECAUSE CAWTHORN'S SAID A LOT OF

03:02.000 --> 03:02.666
OBJECTIONABLE THINGS.

03:02.733 --> 03:03.633
HE'S URGED PEOPLE TO

03:03.700 --> 03:04.866
"LIGHTLY THREATEN" MEMBERS OF

03:04.933 --> 03:06.000
- CONGRESS AHEAD OF JANUARY 6
- TH,

03:06.066 --> 03:07.666
SUGGESTED BIDEN'S DOOR-TO-DOOR

03:07.733 --> 03:08.466
VACCINE STRATEGY COULD BE USED

03:08.533 --> 03:09.666
TO "TAKE PEOPLE'S GUNS

03:09.733 --> 03:11.366
AND BIBLES," AND JUST RECENTLY

03:11.433 --> 03:13.466
CALLED ZELENSKYY A THUG.

03:13.533 --> 03:17.900
HE ALSO OFFERED THIS INCREDIBLE

03:17.966 --> 03:18.666
PIECE OF PARENTING ADVICE

03:18.733 --> 03:19.333
LAST YEAR.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.266
>> MY FRIENDS, THEY'RE TRYING TO

03:20.333 --> 03:20.833
DEMASCULATE THE YOUNG MEN IN

03:20.900 --> 03:21.600
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

03:21.666 --> 03:22.600
WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO

03:22.666 --> 03:23.200
STAND UP.

03:23.266 --> 03:24.466
AND SO I'M TELLING YOU ALL OF

03:24.533 --> 03:25.500
YOU MOMS HERE, THE PEOPLE

03:25.566 --> 03:27.066
WHO I SAID WERE THE MOST VICIOUS

03:27.133 --> 03:29.000
IN OUR MOVEMENT, IF YOU ARE

03:29.066 --> 03:30.966
RAISING A YOUNG MAN, PLEASE

03:31.033 --> 03:32.733
RAISE THEM TO BE A MONSTER.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.566
RAISE --

03:38.266 --> 03:39.166
OH, DON'T WORRY,

03:39.233 --> 03:39.466
MADISON.

03:39.533 --> 03:40.333
I'M SURE THE MOMS WHO RESPONDED

03:40.400 --> 03:41.233
THERE WITH FRONT-ROW BEYONCE

03:41.300 --> 03:44.966
TICKET ENERGY HAVE ALREADY

03:45.033 --> 03:46.366
STRUCK THE EXACT RIGHT BALANCE

03:46.433 --> 03:47.000
OF BIGOTRY, DENIAL OF AFFECTION,

03:47.066 --> 03:47.566
AND CASUAL PERMISSION OF

03:47.633 --> 03:48.400
VIOLENCE THAT'LL HAVE THEIR SONS

03:48.466 --> 03:49.666
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF A TERRIBLE

03:49.733 --> 03:52.500
NEWS STORY SOON ENOUGH.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.733
THE FACT IS, CAWTHORN'S RECORD

03:53.800 --> 03:55.033
WITH THE TRUTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN

03:55.100 --> 03:56.333
UNRELENTINGLY BAD.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.000
HE IMPLIED THE CAR CRASH THAT

03:58.066 --> 03:59.300
LEFT HIM PARTIALLY PARALYZED

03:59.366 --> 04:00.666
DERAILED HIS PLANS TO ATTEND THE

04:00.733 --> 04:02.000
U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY, EVEN THOUGH

04:02.066 --> 04:02.700
HIS APPLICATION HAD ALREADY BEEN

04:02.766 --> 04:05.233
REJECTED BEFORE THE CRASH.

04:05.300 --> 04:05.966
HE FREQUENTLY CLAIMED TO BE

04:06.033 --> 04:07.100
TRAINING FOR THE PARALYMPICS,

04:07.166 --> 04:08.533
WHICH WAS NEWS TO ACTUAL

04:08.600 --> 04:10.500
PARALYMPIANS LIKE

04:10.566 --> 04:11.300
AMANDA McGRORY, WHO POINTED OUT

04:11.366 --> 04:12.333
HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE OFFICIAL

04:12.400 --> 04:18.100
PARALYMPIAN REGISTRY -- WHICH

04:18.166 --> 04:20.333
HE WOULD HAVE TO BE

04:20.400 --> 04:22.033
IN ORDER TO COMPETE --

04:22.100 --> 04:22.666
ADDING, "IT'S LIKE A KID SAYING

04:22.733 --> 04:23.233
THEY WANT TO PLAY IN THE NBA

04:23.300 --> 04:23.700
WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR

04:23.766 --> 04:24.366
FOURTH-GRADE BASKETBALL TEAM."

04:25.233 --> 04:26.300
CAWTHORN OFTEN MAKES REFERENCE

04:26.366 --> 04:26.933
TO HIS DISABILITY OR FINDS WAYS

04:27.033 --> 04:27.766
TO CENTER IT.

04:27.833 --> 04:28.633
LIKE WHEN HE MADE A POINT OF

04:28.700 --> 04:29.133
STANDING FOR THE FLAG

04:29.200 --> 04:30.266
AT THE RNC.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.066
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ESPECIALLY

04:32.133 --> 04:33.566
IRRITATES SOME DISABILITY

04:33.633 --> 04:35.300
ADVOCATES, WHO FEEL IT

04:35.366 --> 04:36.233
PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF SOCIETAL

04:36.300 --> 04:38.166
ABLEISM, ESPECIALLY

04:38.233 --> 04:39.433
THE CULTURAL DESIRE TO SEE

04:39.500 --> 04:40.466
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ONLY AS

04:40.533 --> 04:42.333
"INSPIRATIONAL," WHEN,

04:42.400 --> 04:43.966
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE A BROAD GROUP

04:44.033 --> 04:53.866
OF PEOPLE WHO INCLUDE EVERYONE

04:53.933 --> 04:56.033
FROM INCREDIBLE ATHLETES

04:56.100 --> 04:56.933
TO DOUCHEY FRAT BROS

04:57.000 --> 04:57.933
LYING THEIR WAY TO POWER.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.500
IT TURNS OUT BEING A SHITTY

04:58.566 --> 04:59.233
PERSON, UNLIKE SO MUCH OF OUR

04:59.300 --> 04:59.766
SOCIETY, IS ONE OF THE FEW

04:59.833 --> 05:00.266
THINGS THAT IS ACTUALLY

05:00.333 --> 05:00.933
ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERYONE.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.633
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE, BECAUSE

05:02.700 --> 05:03.700
CAWTHORN WAS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF

05:03.766 --> 05:04.600
A SCATHING PUBLIC LETTER SIGNED

05:04.666 --> 05:05.500
BY MORE THAN 150 OF HIS FORMER

05:05.566 --> 05:07.266
COLLEGE CLASSMATES,

05:07.333 --> 05:08.600
ALLEGING HE ENGAGED IN "SEXUALLY

05:08.666 --> 05:09.033
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR"

05:09.100 --> 05:10.500
WHILE IN COLLEGE.

05:10.566 --> 05:12.866
AND WHILE ON ONE HAND, HE DENIES

05:12.933 --> 05:14.733
THOSE CLAIMS, ON THE OTHER HAND,

05:14.800 --> 05:15.433
THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE MOMENT

05:15.500 --> 05:17.566
IN A DEBATE.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.133
>> IF I HAVE A DAUGHTER, I WANT

05:19.200 --> 05:21.600
HER TO GROW UP IN A WORLD WHERE

05:21.666 --> 05:22.700
PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO ASK

05:22.766 --> 05:23.900
PERMISSION TO TOUCH HER.

05:23.966 --> 05:24.766
I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MY

05:24.833 --> 05:26.000
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE MUCH LESS

05:26.066 --> 05:27.433
AWKWARD IF I KNEW THAT WAS

05:27.500 --> 05:28.600
A QUESTION THAT COULD GENERALLY

05:28.666 --> 05:30.466
BE ASKED.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.333
BUT ALSO, IF I HAVE A SON,

05:32.400 --> 05:33.900
I WANT HIM TO GROW UP IN A WORLD

05:34.000 --> 05:35.366
WHERE HE'S NOT ACCUSED OF BEING

05:35.433 --> 05:37.000
A SEXUAL PREDATOR JUST BECAUSE

05:37.066 --> 05:40.366
HE WANTS TO KISS A GIRL.

05:40.433 --> 05:42.900
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

05:42.966 --> 05:43.633
THAT'S ALREADY HALF TRUE.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.766
NO ONE TELLS BOYS THEY'RE

05:44.833 --> 05:45.333
SEXUAL PREDATORS FOR WANTING

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
TO KISS GIRLS.

05:46.466 --> 05:46.866
HOW ARE WE DOING

05:46.933 --> 05:47.833
ON THE OTHER PART?

05:47.900 --> 05:49.200
I DON'T KNOW, MADISON.

05:49.266 --> 05:49.933
LET'S ASK ANYONE WHO WENT

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
TO COLLEGE WITH YOU.

05:52.066 --> 05:53.833
THE POINT IS, NONE OF WHAT

05:53.900 --> 05:54.900
HAPPENED WITH CAWTHORN THIS WEEK

05:54.966 --> 05:55.533
SHOULD BE REMOTELY SURPRISING TO

05:55.600 --> 05:56.766
ANYONE.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.500
ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHEN HE RAN FOR

05:58.566 --> 05:59.633
OFFICE, THIS WAS ONE OF HIS

05:59.700 --> 06:01.800
ACTUAL ADS.

06:01.866 --> 06:04.000
>> DID YOU HEAR?

06:04.066 --> 06:05.366
MY OPPONENT IS A SIMP.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.366
HE ENDORSED NANCY PELOSI RIGHT

06:07.433 --> 06:10.133
HERE IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.800
I WON'T ENDORSE NANCY PELOSI.

06:12.866 --> 06:13.900
I'LL MAKE HER LIFE

06:13.966 --> 06:14.700
A LIVING HELL.

06:14.766 --> 06:15.833
I BELIEVE YOU CAN RUN YOUR LIFE

06:15.900 --> 06:17.433
BETTER THAN I CAN.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
BETTER THAN ANY SOCIALIST SIMP

06:19.566 --> 06:20.233
CONGRESS CAN.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.333
I'M MADISON CAWTHORN.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.833
I'M NOT A SOCIALIST.

06:22.900 --> 06:23.866
I'M NOT A SIMP.

06:23.933 --> 06:24.866
I AM YOUR WEAPON.

06:24.933 --> 06:25.633
SEND ME TO CONGRESS

06:25.700 --> 06:28.566
TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

06:28.633 --> 06:30.100
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW

06:30.166 --> 06:31.133
MANY TIMES THE WORD "SIMP"

06:31.200 --> 06:32.666
SHOULD APPEAR IN A CAMPAIGN AD,

06:32.733 --> 06:34.700
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THREE.

06:34.766 --> 06:35.833
AND NOW I'VE SAID IT OUT LOUD.

06:35.900 --> 06:36.566
MORE THAN ZERO IS CLEARLY

06:36.633 --> 06:38.233
TOO MANY.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.766
AND FOR THE RECORD, SINCE HIS

06:39.833 --> 06:40.766
ELECTION, CAWTHORN HAS SHOWN

06:40.833 --> 06:41.733
LESS INTEREST IN "FIGHTING FOR"

06:41.800 --> 06:44.033
HIS CONSTITUENTS THAN SHAMELESS

06:44.100 --> 06:45.600
SELF-PROMOTION, REPORTEDLY

06:45.666 --> 06:47.366
TELLING COLLEAGUES HE'D

06:47.433 --> 06:47.933
BUILT HIS STAFF AROUND COMMS

06:48.000 --> 06:49.666
RATHER THAN LEGISLATION,

06:49.733 --> 06:51.166
WHICH ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.933
BECAUSE THIS GUY LOVES POSTING

06:53.000 --> 06:54.533
SHOTS OF HIMSELF ON INSTAGRAM,

06:54.600 --> 06:55.433
WHETHER HE'S FISHING,

06:55.500 --> 06:57.366
SMOKING CIGARS, OR --

06:57.433 --> 06:58.066
IN A POST THAT'S NOW BEEN

06:58.133 --> 06:59.466
DELETED -- VISITING HITLER'S

06:59.533 --> 07:00.933
VACATION HOUSE KNOWN AS THE

07:01.000 --> 07:02.666
"EAGLE'S NEST",

07:02.733 --> 07:03.633
IN WHICH HIS CAPTION REFERS TO

07:03.700 --> 07:05.166
HITLER AS "THE FUHRER"

07:05.233 --> 07:05.966
AND SAYS THE SITE HAD BEEN

07:06.033 --> 07:07.400
ON HIS BUCKET LIST FOR A WHILE

07:07.466 --> 07:09.600
AND "DID NOT DISAPPOINT".

07:09.666 --> 07:11.300
AND LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT THE

07:11.366 --> 07:12.033
WORST THING, BUT THERE'S ALSO

07:12.100 --> 07:13.200
THIS PHOTO, CAPTIONED,

07:13.266 --> 07:14.366
"GETTING CRAZY WITH SOME APPLE

07:14.433 --> 07:15.566
COBBLER MADE RIGHT OVER THE

07:15.633 --> 07:16.233
SMOKE."

07:16.300 --> 07:17.533
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,

07:17.600 --> 07:18.533
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY

07:18.600 --> 07:19.933
NOT A COBBLER.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.033
IT DOESN'T HAVE A BISCUIT

07:21.100 --> 07:22.200
OR A PIE DOUGH TOPPING.

07:22.266 --> 07:23.033
IT'S NOT A BUCKLE BECAUSE I

07:23.100 --> 07:23.500
DON'T SEE A CAKE BASE

07:23.566 --> 07:24.666
WITH A STREUSEL TOPPING.

07:24.733 --> 07:25.900
IF HE WAS THROWING IT

07:25.966 --> 07:27.033
ON A STOVETOP, HE COULD TRY TO

07:27.100 --> 07:27.400
CALL IT A GRUNT

07:27.466 --> 07:29.000
BUT IT ISN'T ONE.

07:29.066 --> 07:29.800
IT'S NOT AN APPLE BROWN BETTY.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.833
IT'S NOT A CRISP.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.433
AND IF YOU'RE CALLING THAT

07:31.500 --> 07:32.400
A SONKER, YOU'RE DEAD FUCKING

07:32.466 --> 07:34.233
WRONG, MY FRIEND.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.366
IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE

07:35.433 --> 07:36.133
GRATED A MEDIUM-SIZED BABY

07:36.200 --> 07:37.366
INTO A SKILLET.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.066
THAT'S NOTHING.

07:39.133 --> 07:40.966
THAT'S FUCKING NOTHING, MADISON.

07:41.033 --> 07:41.266
WORDS.

07:41.333 --> 07:41.833
MEAN.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.166
THINGS.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.866
BUT THE ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF

07:45.933 --> 08:00.600
HIS INSTAGRAM IS PROBABLY THIS.

08:00.666 --> 08:01.600
YEAH, HE APPEARS TO BE

08:01.666 --> 08:02.233
PUNCHING A TREE BECAUSE IT LOOKS

08:02.300 --> 08:03.700
WEAK.

08:03.766 --> 08:04.933
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY TOLD

08:05.000 --> 08:05.700
THE STORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON

08:05.766 --> 08:07.200
CHOPPING DOWN THE CHERRY TREE

08:07.266 --> 08:08.900
TO A DOG, AND THEN THAT

08:08.966 --> 08:10.633
DOG TOLD MADISON CAWTHORN.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.300
IT IS, AND THIS IS TRUE,

08:11.366 --> 08:12.533
ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS

08:12.600 --> 08:14.166
I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE

08:14.233 --> 08:15.700
LIFE.

08:15.766 --> 08:16.366
IF, WHEN I DIE, I MEET GOD,

08:16.433 --> 08:17.466
AND GOD SAYS "HEY.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.500
DID YOU SEE THAT STUPID THING?"

08:19.566 --> 08:20.333
I WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT GOD

08:20.400 --> 08:22.333
IS TALKING ABOUT.

08:22.400 --> 08:29.300
AND ALL OF THIS IS REALLY TO

08:29.366 --> 08:30.666
SAY, KEVIN MCCARTHY, THIS IS THE

08:30.733 --> 08:31.533
GUY THAT SURPRISED YOU THIS

08:31.600 --> 08:31.833
WEEK?

08:31.900 --> 08:32.600
THIS PREDATORY, CONSPIRATORIAL,

08:32.666 --> 08:33.433
INEXPLICABLY HOSTILE TO TREES

08:33.500 --> 08:34.300
GUY?

08:34.366 --> 08:35.666
YOUR PARTY'S SUPPORTED AND

08:35.733 --> 08:37.266
ENABLED HIM THIS WHOLE TIME.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.500
AND THE TACTICS HE USES ARE

08:38.566 --> 08:39.766
PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE

08:39.833 --> 08:40.533
REPUBLICANS' WHOLE M.O.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.433
RIGHT NOW.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.366
OR TO PUT THIS IN TERMS MADISON

08:47.700 --> 08:48.733
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU RAISED

08:48.800 --> 08:49.266
A MONSTER,

08:49.333 --> 08:49.800
AND NOW IT'S YOUR FUCKING

08:49.866 --> 08:51.133
PROBLEM.

08:51.200 --> 08:58.766
AND NOW THIS.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.333
>> LOCAL NEWS HAS AN URGENT

09:00.400 --> 09:02.533
WARNING.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.733

>> IF YOU'RE GOING IN EXPECTING

09:09.800 --> 09:12.466
THIS SEASON FROM THE STUFF YOU

09:12.533 --> 09:15.966
GOT LAST SEASON, NOT GETTING IT.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.000
SOME OF THAT SPACE.

09:17.066 --> 09:17.200
OKAY.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.600
>> I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT

09:18.666 --> 09:21.200
ENJOYING IT BUT LAST SEASON WAS

09:21.266 --> 09:22.166
HAPPIER.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.700
>> NOT AS STEAMY AS THE FIRST.

09:24.766 --> 09:27.566
>> NOT AS HOT AND HEAVY.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.266
>> YOU ARE WATCHING BRIDGERTON

09:30.333 --> 09:31.433
FOR SEX QUESTIONING >> THE WAY

09:31.500 --> 09:32.000
IT IS AS BEAUTIFUL.

09:32.066 --> 09:34.600
SOME OF THE STORY LINES WERE

09:34.666 --> 09:36.033
REALLY COOL.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.766
I WAS EXPECTING MORE, MORE.

09:38.833 --> 09:39.100
SPEAKER OKAY.

09:39.166 --> 09:47.200
>> LESS BUMPING UGLIES.

09:47.266 --> 09:49.933
>> THEY ARE JUST PLAYING POLO.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.833
>> LAST SEASON, YOU REMEMBER HE

09:52.900 --> 09:54.533
WAS UNBUTTONING AND UNZIPPING AN

09:54.600 --> 09:54.800
UNLACING.

09:54.866 --> 09:58.366
>> IT'S NICE.

09:58.433 --> 09:58.600
>> OKAY.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.400
>> IT'S GOOD.

10:01.466 --> 10:03.300
IT'S JUST NOT GREAT.

10:03.366 --> 10:08.433
>> NO, IT'S JUST NOT...

10:08.500 --> 10:08.633
THAT.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.400
>> THEY SPICE.

10:09.466 --> 10:10.400
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

10:10.466 --> 10:14.333
>> I DO.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.133
MOVING ON.

10:15.200 --> 10:15.766
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:15.833 --> 10:16.366
TRUCKS.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.100
EVERYBODY LOVES THEM, FROM

10:17.166 --> 10:17.700
KIDS WHO LIKE THE FACT THEY GO

10:17.766 --> 10:18.233
HONK HONK TO PRODUCERS OF

10:18.300 --> 10:19.033
REALITY SHOWS, WHO IT SEEMS

10:19.100 --> 10:19.566
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF TRUCKS

10:19.633 --> 10:20.733
AND THEIR DRIVERS.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.233
>> ACROSS AMERICA, GIANT TRUCKS

10:23.300 --> 10:24.233
WITH CARGOS WORTH MILLIONS

10:24.300 --> 10:25.766
VANISH INTO THIN AIR.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.933
BIG RIG BOUNTY HUNTERS.

10:28.000 --> 10:28.833
>> THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO

10:28.900 --> 10:29.466
LEARN THIS JOB THAN ACTUALLY

10:29.533 --> 10:31.233
DOING IT.

10:31.300 --> 10:31.933
>> HIGHWAY THROUGH HELL.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.300
ALL NEW.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.033

10:36.400 --> 10:45.733
NEW SERIES.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.266
>> ICE ROAD TRUCKERS.

10:47.333 --> 10:47.900
- BEGINS SUNDAY, JUNE 17
- TH,

10:47.966 --> 10:48.900
AT 10:00.

10:48.966 --> 10:50.033
WOW!

10:50.100 --> 10:51.333
APPARENTLY PEOPLE LIKE THEIR

10:51.400 --> 10:53.033
REALITY TRUCKER SHOWS THE SAME

10:54.500 --> 10:55.700
FULL OF ICE AND INTENSE ENOUGH

10:55.766 --> 10:58.900
TO MAKE ME SHIT MYSELF.

10:58.966 --> 10:59.533
BUT TRUCKS AREN'T JUST A STAPLE

10:59.600 --> 11:00.800
OF REALITY TV.

11:00.866 --> 11:01.866
THEY'RE A VITAL PART OF OUR

11:01.933 --> 11:03.066
ECONOMY, CARRYING 70%

11:03.133 --> 11:03.600
OF THE TONNAGE THAT MOVES

11:03.666 --> 11:05.933
AROUND AMERICA.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.733
AND THE DRIVERS KNOW JUST HOW

11:07.800 --> 11:08.233
MUCH THIS COUNTRY

11:08.300 --> 11:10.100
RELIES ON THEM.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.433
>> IF THESE TRUCKS WERE SET --

11:11.500 --> 11:15.300
SHUT DOWN, FOR ONE WEEK,

11:15.366 --> 11:17.400
THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE IN --

11:17.466 --> 11:19.033
>> THREE DAYS?

11:19.100 --> 11:20.100
>> THREE DAYS.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.600
THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE,

11:23.666 --> 11:25.333
THEY'D SHUT THE COUNTRY DOWN.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.666
'CAUSE NOTHING YOU EAT, WEAR,

11:28.733 --> 11:34.066
DRINK, DRIVE, DOESN'T MOVE ON

11:34.133 --> 11:37.100
A TRUCK.

11:37.166 --> 11:37.900
RIGHT.

11:37.966 --> 11:38.566
IT'S PRETTY UPSETTING TO REALIZE

11:38.633 --> 11:39.233
THAT, WITHOUT TRUCKS, AFTER JUST

11:39.300 --> 11:39.500
A WEEK --

11:39.566 --> 11:40.133
>> THREE DAYS!

11:40.200 --> 11:43.133
SORRY, THREE DAYS,

11:43.200 --> 11:44.133
EVERY PRODUCE DEPARTMENT IN

11:44.200 --> 11:46.133
AMERICA WOULD GO FROM

11:46.200 --> 11:47.300
FULLY-STOCKED MARKET TO

11:47.366 --> 11:48.266
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT RACCOON

11:48.333 --> 11:49.033
BUFFET.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.000
SO IT'S NO WONDER TRUCKING'S

11:50.066 --> 11:50.766
A HUGE INDUSTRY, WITH

11:50.833 --> 11:51.566
MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE IN

11:51.633 --> 11:53.166
AMERICA WORKING AS DRIVERS,

11:53.233 --> 11:54.900
FROM PORT TRUCKERS WHO BRING

11:54.966 --> 11:56.166
GOODS OFF SHIPS TO

11:56.233 --> 11:57.900
RAILYARDS AND WAREHOUSES, TO

11:57.966 --> 11:59.066
LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS WHO MOVE THEM

11:59.133 --> 12:00.400
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, TO

12:00.466 --> 12:01.833
"LAST MILE" DRIVERS, WHO TAKE

12:01.900 --> 12:03.166
CARE OF LOCAL DELIVERY.

12:03.233 --> 12:04.766
AND YET, AS YOU'VE PROBABLY

12:04.833 --> 12:05.300
HEARD RECENTLY, THE WHOLE

12:05.366 --> 12:06.200
INDUSTRY IS FACING A MASSIVE

12:06.266 --> 12:08.033
PROBLEM.

12:08.100 --> 12:08.866
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

12:08.933 --> 12:09.900
TURN NOW TO A NATIONWIDE

12:09.966 --> 12:11.533
SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.833
>> MAJOR TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE

12:12.900 --> 12:13.866
STRAINING THE ALREADY STRETCHED

12:13.933 --> 12:14.766
CHAIN.

12:14.833 --> 12:15.333
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

12:15.400 --> 12:16.733
AN END IN SIGHT.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.933
>> EMPTY STORE SHELVES SIGNAL

12:18.000 --> 12:21.133
A SUPPLY CHAIN IN CRISIS,

12:21.200 --> 12:22.600
EXACERBATED BY A SHORTAGE OF

12:22.666 --> 12:24.266
TRUCK DRIVERS.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.166
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T

12:25.233 --> 12:26.433
SOUND GOOD, DOES IT?

12:26.500 --> 12:27.233
THE ONLY TIME I'M ACTIVELY

12:27.300 --> 12:28.666
ROOTING FOR A SUPPLY CHAIN

12:28.733 --> 12:29.600
CRISIS IS WHENEVER A

12:29.666 --> 12:30.333
CONTAINER SHIP GETS STUCK IN THE

12:30.400 --> 12:32.166
SUEZ CANAL.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.966
I DON'T CARE IF THE GLOBAL

12:35.033 --> 12:36.100
ECONOMY COLLAPSES, I JUST LOVE

12:36.166 --> 12:38.500
TO SEE THAT BIG RECTANGLE STUCK.

12:38.566 --> 12:41.100
THE POINT IS, TRUCKING COMPANIES

12:41.166 --> 12:41.733
HAVE BEEN QUICK TO CLAIM THEY'RE

12:41.800 --> 12:42.700
SUFFERING A SHORTAGE OF DRIVERS.

12:42.766 --> 12:43.266
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THAT

12:43.333 --> 12:44.300
FOR A WHILE.

12:44.366 --> 12:46.366
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THEIR ACTUAL

12:46.433 --> 12:47.366
PROBLEM IS LESS A PROBLEM OF

12:47.433 --> 12:48.966
DRIVER SHORTAGE, AND MORE OF

12:49.033 --> 12:50.533
DRIVER RETENTION.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.666
BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

12:51.733 --> 12:52.533
PEOPLE BECOME TRUCK DRIVERS

12:52.600 --> 12:54.500
EVERY YEAR.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.166
BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

12:56.233 --> 12:57.733
ALSO QUIT.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.300
JOB TURNOVER FOR TRUCKERS

12:59.366 --> 13:00.700
AVERAGES OVER 100%,

13:00.766 --> 13:02.533
AND AT SOME COMPANIES

13:02.600 --> 13:04.066
IT'S AS HIGH AS 300%, MEANING

13:04.133 --> 13:05.100
THEY'RE HIRING THREE PEOPLE FOR

13:05.166 --> 13:06.100
A SINGLE JOB OVER THE COURSE

13:06.166 --> 13:08.233
OF A YEAR.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.033
AND WHEN A FIELD THIS IMPORTANT

13:10.100 --> 13:10.900
HAS A LEVEL OF JOB SATISFACTION

13:10.966 --> 13:14.633
THAT LOW, IT SURE SEEMS LIKE

13:14.700 --> 13:15.833
THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.533
SO TONIGHT, LET'S EXAMINE THE

13:17.600 --> 13:19.266
HOW DRIVERS

13:19.333 --> 13:20.633
MAKE A LIVING, HOW THEY OFTEN

13:20.700 --> 13:21.700
DON'T, AND HOW COMPANIES BENEFIT

13:21.766 --> 13:24.000
FROM THE WHOLE MISERABLE SYSTEM.

13:24.066 --> 13:25.333
AND THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS,

13:25.400 --> 13:27.733
IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.166
IN THE 1970s, TRUCK DRIVING WAS

13:29.233 --> 13:30.933
A SOLID MIDDLE-CLASS PROFESSION,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.766
WITH TRUCKER CULTURE EVEN

13:32.833 --> 13:33.933
BECOMING TRENDY, THROUGH SONGS

13:34.000 --> 13:35.633
LIKE "CONVOY," MOVIES LIKE

13:35.700 --> 13:37.166
"EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE",

13:37.233 --> 13:38.433
AND TV SHOWS LIKE

13:38.500 --> 13:39.333
"BJ AND THE BEAR", ABOUT

13:39.400 --> 13:40.733
A TRUCKER AND HIS CHIMPANZEE

13:40.800 --> 13:42.033
FRIEND.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.500
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING THAT SHOW

13:43.566 --> 13:44.366
SOUNDS WEIRD, YOU DON'T KNOW THE

13:44.433 --> 13:46.700
HALF OF IT.

13:46.766 --> 13:48.366
>> BJ WAS A HAPPY GO LUCKY

13:48.433 --> 13:49.100
TRUCKER WHO WOULD HAUL ANYTHING

13:49.166 --> 13:50.166
FOR A PRICE.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.333
>> YOU'RE THE GUY, AREN'T YOU?

13:51.400 --> 13:52.566
THE GUY WHO'LL HAUL ANYTHING

13:52.633 --> 13:53.166
ANYWHERE FOR A BUCK AND A HALF

13:53.233 --> 13:54.533
A MILE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.533
>> BUT THIS TIME, HIS CARGO WAS

13:56.600 --> 13:58.466
ELEVEN YOUNG WOMEN ESCAPING FROM

13:58.533 --> 13:59.466
A WHITE SLAVERY GANG.

13:59.533 --> 14:00.633
>> ROADBLOCKS MEAN NOTHING TO

14:00.700 --> 14:03.300
BJ MCKAY, AN EX-POW AND

14:03.366 --> 14:04.866
HELICOPTER PILOT FROM VIETNAM.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.166
CLAUDE AKINS AND BETTY FINDER

14:07.233 --> 14:08.066
STAR IN BJ AND THE BEAR, NEXT

14:08.133 --> 14:09.433
WEDNESDAY AT 9:00, 8:00 CENTRAL

14:09.500 --> 14:10.800
AND MOUNTAIN.

14:10.866 --> 14:12.633
YES!

14:12.700 --> 14:13.133
THE TRUE GOLDEN AGE OF

14:13.200 --> 14:15.900
TELEVISION RIGHT THERE.

14:15.966 --> 14:16.900
THIS MEDIUM PEAKED IN 1979 AND

14:16.966 --> 14:17.533
WE'LL NEVER SEE THE MOUNTAINTOP

14:17.600 --> 14:19.866
AGAIN.

14:19.933 --> 14:20.833
THAT PROMO STARTED --

14:20.900 --> 14:22.433
STARTED!

14:22.500 --> 14:23.333
WITH A DRIVER LIVING WITH

14:23.400 --> 14:24.766
A CHIMPANZEE AND ESCALATED

14:24.833 --> 14:26.033
SO FAST, CASEY KASEM DIDN'T HAVE

14:26.100 --> 14:28.200
TIME TO MENTION THE CHIMP.

14:28.266 --> 14:29.600
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

14:29.666 --> 14:32.100
WAS THE CHIMP ALSO IN VIETNAM?

14:32.166 --> 14:33.033
WHY IS HE CALLED BEAR?

14:33.100 --> 14:33.433
WHO CARES?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.600
THERE'S NO TIME!

14:35.666 --> 14:36.533
IT SEEMS WE'RE SHOOTING GUNS

14:36.600 --> 14:38.166
FROM HELICOPTERS AT OTHER

14:38.233 --> 14:39.400
HELICOPTERS NOW, THOSE DETAILS

14:39.466 --> 14:40.966
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT.

14:41.033 --> 14:41.533
EVERY YEAR THE EMMYS SHOULD

14:41.600 --> 14:42.233
RELEASE A STATEMENT SAYING

14:42.300 --> 14:43.600
"ALL AWARDS GO TO BJ AND THE

14:43.666 --> 14:46.100
BEAR, AGAIN.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.233
TRY HARDER NEXT YEAR, TV."

14:48.300 --> 14:49.633
BUT THE TRUTH IS, TRUCK DRIVING

14:49.700 --> 14:51.066
WAS GENUINELY A DECENT JOB.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.133
BUT THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE IN

14:52.200 --> 14:54.866
1980, JIMMY CARTER SIGNED THE

14:54.933 --> 14:56.500
MOTOR CARRIER ACT, DEREGULATING

14:56.566 --> 14:57.066
THE MARKET IN AN ATTEMPT TO

14:57.133 --> 15:01.400
LOWER PRICES FOR CONSUMERS.

15:01.466 --> 15:02.366
THAT SET OFF A RACE TO THE

15:02.433 --> 15:05.166
BOTTOM AMONG TRUCKING COMPANIES.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.233
AND 40 YEARS LATER, THE

15:06.300 --> 15:08.633
BASE COMPENSATION FOR LONG-HAUL

15:08.700 --> 15:10.466
TRUCK DRIVERS IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15:10.533 --> 15:12.800
DOWN 50% IN REAL TERMS.

15:12.866 --> 15:14.266
AND THERE ARE THREE KEY PROBLEMS

15:14.333 --> 15:14.866
WITH THE WAY THE INDUSTRY'S

15:14.933 --> 15:15.600
CURRENTLY SET UP THAT WE'RE

15:15.666 --> 15:17.100
GOING TO LOOK AT.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.966
THE FIRST IS HOW THEY'RE PAID.

15:19.033 --> 15:20.833
BECAUSE MOST LONG-HAUL DRIVERS

15:20.900 --> 15:21.866
ARE PAID BY THE MILE, NOT BY THE

15:21.933 --> 15:23.666
HOUR.

15:23.733 --> 15:25.166
RAISING OBVIOUS QUESTIONS,

15:25.233 --> 15:26.733
LIKE WHAT ABOUT WHEN TRUCKS ARE

15:26.800 --> 15:28.400
WAITING TO LOAD, UNLOAD

15:28.466 --> 15:29.133
AND RELOAD?

15:29.200 --> 15:29.766
DO THEY REALLY NOT GET PAID

15:29.833 --> 15:30.866
FOR THAT?

15:30.933 --> 15:32.133
AND FOR THE MOST PART,

15:32.200 --> 15:33.566
THEY DON'T.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.733
THIS IS A HUGE STICKING POINT

15:34.800 --> 15:36.000
FOR TRUCK DRIVERS.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.533
IF YOU EVER GO ON

15:37.600 --> 15:39.033
TRUCKER YOUTUBE OR TIKTOK --

15:39.100 --> 15:40.533
WHICH YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD --

15:40.600 --> 15:41.500
YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF VIDEOS LIKE

15:41.566 --> 15:43.266
THESE.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.533
>> WHY DO WE HAVE TO SIT IN A

15:45.600 --> 15:47.266
DOCK FOR THREE HOURS OR THREE

15:47.333 --> 15:48.200
AND A HALF HOURS UP TO THIS

15:48.266 --> 15:49.266
POINT?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.900
>> I'VE BEEN IN THE SHIPPER

15:51.966 --> 15:59.400
NOW FOR 19 HOURS.

15:59.466 --> 16:00.500
NO OTHER -- NOT MANY OTHER JOBS

16:00.566 --> 16:01.666
WHERE YOU CAN JUST BE ON THE JOB

16:01.733 --> 16:02.766
AND NOT GET PAID.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.700
>> YOU'RE SITTING OVER THERE

16:03.766 --> 16:04.666
JUDGING ME, BUT I DON'T HAVE A

16:04.733 --> 16:07.233
RELOAD, WE CAN'T MOVE.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.400
>> IT'S NOT ME, IT'S NOT ME,

16:08.466 --> 16:10.600
IT'S DISPATCH!

16:10.666 --> 16:12.200
I CAN'T HELP THAT THE DISPATCHER

16:12.266 --> 16:14.133
IS SLOW AS SHIT!

16:14.200 --> 16:15.366
WELL, YOU CALL AND TELL HIM,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.100
I AIN'T -- YOU AIN'T --

16:17.166 --> 16:18.700
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF YOU AIN'T

16:18.766 --> 16:19.366
GOT NO THUMBS, YOU CALL AND TELL

16:19.433 --> 16:20.000
HIM.

16:20.066 --> 16:20.733
YEAH, THAT'S A MAJOR

16:20.800 --> 16:21.966
PROBLEM.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.733
THE WAITING TIME.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.366
THAT IS, NOT THE FACT THAT DOGS

16:24.433 --> 16:25.100
DON'T HAVE THUMBS AND CAN'T USE

16:25.166 --> 16:28.866
A PHONE.

16:28.933 --> 16:30.066
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING.

16:30.133 --> 16:31.466
BECAUSE IF THEY COULD, THEY'D

16:31.533 --> 16:32.100
LITERALLY NEVER STOP TEXTING YOU

16:32.166 --> 16:32.666
SHIT LIKE "FUCK, FUCK, FUCK

16:32.733 --> 16:33.633
I JUST SAW A SQUIRREL!"

16:33.700 --> 16:34.700
AND "MISS U, LOVE U.

16:34.766 --> 16:35.266
FUCK, JUST SAW THE SQUIRREL

16:35.333 --> 16:36.633
AGAIN!"

16:36.700 --> 16:38.966
AND WHILE THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN

16:39.033 --> 16:40.366
A PROBLEM, LONG WAITS AT LOADING

16:40.433 --> 16:40.900
DOCKS HAVE ACTUALLY JUMPED

16:40.966 --> 16:45.966
SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.600
AND IF YOU LOSE HALF YOUR WORK

16:47.666 --> 16:49.266
DAY WAITING, YOU'RE INCENTIVIZED

16:49.333 --> 16:49.900
TO TRY AND MAKE UP FOR THAT TIME

16:49.966 --> 16:51.633
ONCE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.866
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.333
IF I ONLY GOT PAID PER JOKE

16:55.400 --> 16:57.000
ABOUT AT&T, I'D TRY TO CRAM IN

16:57.066 --> 16:59.000
AS MANY AT&T JOKES AS POSSIBLE.

16:59.066 --> 17:00.233
I'D BE DROPPING THEM LIKE AT&T

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
DROPS CALLS.

17:02.366 --> 17:03.700
BECAUSE THE MORE JOHNNY BURNS,

17:03.766 --> 17:06.433
THE MORE JOHNNY EARNS.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.233
BUT THIS CAN BE A REAL SAFETY

17:07.300 --> 17:08.700
PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.733
5,000 PEOPLE EACH YEAR ARE

17:10.800 --> 17:12.100
KILLED IN CRASHES INVOLVING

17:12.166 --> 17:13.866
LARGE TRUCKS.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.300
NOW, THE GOVERNMENT'S TRIED TO

17:15.366 --> 17:16.633
ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS BY

17:16.700 --> 17:17.666
MANDATING BREAKS AND LIMITING

17:17.733 --> 17:18.866
THE NUMBER OF HOURS TRUCKERS

17:18.933 --> 17:20.200
CAN BE ON THE ROAD.

17:20.266 --> 17:21.400
THEY EVEN REQUIRE ELECTRONIC

17:21.466 --> 17:23.533
MONITORING DEVICES LIKE THIS

17:23.600 --> 17:25.433
ONE, THAT LOG WHEN THE TRUCK IS

17:25.500 --> 17:27.133
MOVING, TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.600
BUT MANY DRIVERS FIND THAT

17:28.666 --> 17:30.033
FRUSTRATING IN A DIFFERENT WAY,

17:30.100 --> 17:31.866
BECAUSE IT LIMITS THEIR AGENCY

17:31.933 --> 17:36.366
OVER HOW AND WHEN THEY DRIVE.

17:36.433 --> 17:37.266
>> WE'RE NOT COMPUTERS.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.800
WE DON'T HAVE AN OFF BUTTON.

17:38.866 --> 17:39.533
THE THING THIS DOES DO IS --

17:39.600 --> 17:40.466
IS IT FORCES YOU TO GET UP

17:40.533 --> 17:42.066
AND GO IF YOU'RE TIRED.

17:42.133 --> 17:42.933
IT FORCES YOU TO GET UP AND GO

17:43.000 --> 17:44.133
IF YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD.

17:44.200 --> 17:44.733
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT RUNNING

17:44.800 --> 17:46.000
24 HOURS A DAY.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.200
IT'S ABOUT MAKING A COMMON SENSE

17:47.266 --> 17:49.966
DECISION ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL, HOW

17:50.033 --> 17:51.433
THE ROAD CONDITIONS ARE, WHETHER

17:51.500 --> 17:52.433
OR NOT YOU WANT TO RUN THROUGH

17:52.500 --> 17:53.666
RUSH HOUR, ET CETERA, ET CETERA,

17:53.733 --> 17:54.633
ET CETERA.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.900
LOOK.

17:55.966 --> 17:57.100
THERE ARE SOME JOBS YOU CAN

17:57.166 --> 17:58.133
ABSOLUTELY DO IF YOU DON'T FEEL

17:58.200 --> 17:58.800
GOOD.

17:58.866 --> 18:00.433
LIKE THIS ONE.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.200
I FEEL LIKE SHIT ALL THE TIME.

18:02.266 --> 18:08.433
LOOK AT ME.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.200
BUT IT DOESN'T

18:09.266 --> 18:09.966
REALLY MATTER, BECAUSE

18:10.033 --> 18:10.633
THIS DESK ISN'T MOVING

18:10.700 --> 18:11.100
AT 80 MILES AN HOUR,

18:11.166 --> 18:11.700
SO THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY

18:11.766 --> 18:12.600
POOR JOB PERFORMANCE

18:12.666 --> 18:14.000
ARE NOT LIKELY TO KILL ANYONE.

18:14.066 --> 18:14.666
AND WHEN THESE RIGID RULES BUMP

18:14.733 --> 18:15.733
UP AGAINST UNPREDICTABLE WORK

18:15.800 --> 18:16.600
HOURS, DRIVERS ARE PUT IN AN

18:16.666 --> 18:18.533
IMPOSSIBLE PLACE.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.166
TAKE THIS DRIVER, WHOSE COMPANY

18:20.233 --> 18:21.900
MADE HIM TAKE HIS TEN-HOUR BREAK

18:22.000 --> 18:23.300
DURING THE DAY, WHEN HE COULDN'T

18:23.366 --> 18:24.766
SLEEP, AND THEN FOUND HIMSELF

18:24.833 --> 18:27.666
DRIVING EXHAUSTED AT NIGHT.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.633
AND WHEN HE CALLED HIS

18:28.700 --> 18:29.500
DISPATCHER TO SAY HE FELT UNSAFE

18:29.566 --> 18:30.466
TO DRIVE, JUST WATCH HOW BADLY

18:30.533 --> 18:32.600
THE CALL WENT.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.033
>> HEY, MAN, WE GOT A BIT OF

18:34.100 --> 18:34.533
A PROBLEM, DUDE.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.700
I'M STARTING TO FALL ASLEEP

18:35.766 --> 18:37.833
GOING DOWN THE ROAD HERE.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.033
>> BUT GET A LOAD OF THIS,

18:39.100 --> 18:40.333
THE K&B DISPATCHERS, INSTEAD OF

18:40.400 --> 18:42.500
TELLING HIM TO JUST GET SOME

18:42.566 --> 18:43.966
REST, HOT POTATO ABE FROM ONE

18:44.033 --> 18:46.100
DISPATCHER TO ANOTHER, EACH OF

18:46.166 --> 18:48.700
THEM WITH THE SAME ADVICE.

18:48.766 --> 18:50.066
>> GET SOME COFFEE AND THEN

18:50.133 --> 18:51.300
LET'S -- 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

18:51.366 --> 18:52.800
A CHOICE ON THIS.

18:52.866 --> 18:53.933
EITHER GET SOME COFFEE, WALK

18:54.000 --> 18:55.600
AROUND THE TRUCK, DO SOMETHING?

18:55.666 --> 18:56.933
>> I ALREADY DID THAT EARLIER,

18:57.000 --> 18:57.100
MAN.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.100
>> LET'S GET OUT AND GET SOME

18:59.166 --> 18:59.600
FRESH AIR, WHAT IS IT,

18:59.666 --> 19:00.733
ABOUT 10 DEGREES OUTSIDE?

19:00.800 --> 19:01.500
>> YEP.

19:01.566 --> 19:02.100
>> THAT'LL WAKE YOU RIGHT UP,

19:02.166 --> 19:03.366
RIGHT?

19:03.433 --> 19:04.100
>> I'M TELLING YOU.

19:04.166 --> 19:04.700
I'M NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AT THE

19:04.766 --> 19:05.866
MOMENT.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.133
>> OKAY, WELL THEN, HERE'S THE

19:07.200 --> 19:07.866
DEAL, WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

19:07.933 --> 19:09.066
ON THIS.

19:09.133 --> 19:09.733
THAT'S NOT HOW WE WORK HERE

19:09.800 --> 19:10.700
AT K&B.

19:10.766 --> 19:11.633
>> I SAY I'M NOT GONNA HURT

19:11.700 --> 19:12.966
ANYBODY OUT HERE ON THE ROAD.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.300
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:14.366 --> 19:15.233
YOU DON'T NEED TO JUMP TO THAT.

19:15.300 --> 19:15.733
THAT'S DRAMATIC

19:15.800 --> 19:16.400
THAT I DON'T NEED THIS MORNING,

19:16.466 --> 19:18.366
RIGHT?

19:18.433 --> 19:19.400
WOW, "I DON'T NEED THAT

19:19.466 --> 19:20.500
THIS MORNING"?

19:20.566 --> 19:22.000
THAT'S A HELL OF A STATEMENT.

19:22.066 --> 19:22.900
"GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT

19:22.966 --> 19:25.400
DRAMATIC SHIT UNTIL AT LEAST

19:25.466 --> 19:26.066
1:00 P.M.,

19:26.133 --> 19:27.066
IT'S LIKE THIS MUG SAYS.

19:27.133 --> 19:27.633
"DON'T CONFRONT ME WITH THE

19:27.700 --> 19:29.000
POTENTIALLY LETHAL CONSEQUENCES

19:29.066 --> 19:30.033
OF MY RECKLESS DECISION MAKING

19:30.100 --> 19:32.400
UNTIL AFTER I'VE HAD MY COFFEE."

19:32.466 --> 19:33.966
SO DRIVERS END UP GETTING

19:34.033 --> 19:38.800
SQUEEZED BETWEEN REGULATIONS

19:38.866 --> 19:39.500
AND THE COMPANIES,

19:39.566 --> 19:40.833
AND AT NO POINT IN THE PROCESS

19:40.900 --> 19:41.466
ARE THEIR OWN FEELINGS OR NEEDS

19:41.533 --> 19:41.900
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

19:41.966 --> 19:42.666
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY THEY

19:42.733 --> 19:44.333
GET SQUEEZED.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.266
BECAUSE THE SECOND EXPLOITATIVE

19:46.333 --> 19:47.400
QUIRK OF THIS INDUSTRY CONCERNS

19:47.466 --> 19:48.400
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DRIVERS

19:48.466 --> 19:50.433
AND TRUCKING COMPANIES.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.800
MANY CARRIERS CLASSIFY DRIVERS

19:52.866 --> 19:53.633
NOT AS EMPLOYEES, BUT AS

19:53.700 --> 19:56.100
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.400
AND WHILE THERE ARE SOME TO WHOM

19:57.466 --> 19:59.333
THAT LABEL TRULY APPLIES --

19:59.400 --> 20:00.333
THOSE WHO GENUINELY HAVE THE

20:00.400 --> 20:02.866
FREEDOM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

20:02.933 --> 20:03.733
DIFFERENT LOADS AND HAUL FOR

20:03.800 --> 20:04.600
WHOMEVER THEY WANT -- THE FACT

20:04.666 --> 20:06.366
IS, MANY COMPANIES MISCLASSIFY

20:06.433 --> 20:08.466
DRIVERS AS INDEPENDENT WHO WORK

20:08.533 --> 20:10.066
EXCLUSIVELY FOR THEM, AND WHOSE

20:10.133 --> 20:10.533
DAY-TO-DAY LIVES THEY

20:10.600 --> 20:13.033
FUNDAMENTALLY CONTROL.

20:13.100 --> 20:13.900
AND THERE ARE OBVIOUS REASONS

20:13.966 --> 20:15.166
FOR COMPANIES TO DO THIS,

20:15.233 --> 20:17.233
AS THIS TRUCKER EXPLAINS.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.566
>> I'M NOT CLASSIFIED

20:18.633 --> 20:19.700
AS AN EMPLOYEE.

20:19.766 --> 20:20.533
I AM CLASSIFIED AS AN

20:20.600 --> 20:22.400
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, BUT I

20:22.466 --> 20:24.000
HAVE VERY, VERY LITTLE CONTROL

20:24.066 --> 20:25.966
OVER THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF

20:26.033 --> 20:27.533
MY COMPANY.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.366
>> DESPITE HIS SO-CALLED

20:29.433 --> 20:30.833
INDEPENDENCE, PRIOR WORKS

20:30.900 --> 20:31.666
EXCLUSIVELY FOR SHIPPERS, WHICH

20:31.733 --> 20:33.766
DOLES OUT HIS DAILY ROUTES.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.133
HE HAS SEEN HIS PAYCHECKS

20:35.200 --> 20:36.266
DWINDLE, AND HAS NONE OF THE

20:36.333 --> 20:37.233
PROTECTIONS HE WOULD GET AS AN

20:37.300 --> 20:39.066
EMPLOYEE.

20:39.133 --> 20:40.200
>> AS LONG AS WE'RE INDEPENDENT

20:40.266 --> 20:40.833
CONTRACTORS, THEY DON'T HAVE TO

20:40.900 --> 20:41.866
COVER BENEFITS, THEY DON'T HAVE

20:41.933 --> 20:44.300
TO COVER SICK DAYS, BEREAVEMENT

20:44.366 --> 20:47.733
LEAVE TIME, HOLIDAY PAY.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.366
IT JUST SAVES THE COMPANY MONEY.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.666
YEAH, OF COURSE THIS IS

20:51.733 --> 20:53.333
ATTRACTIVE FOR COMPANIES.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.233
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE YOU

20:54.300 --> 20:55.100
TIME OFF WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER

20:55.166 --> 20:56.533
DIES.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.366
SO UNLESS YOUR NANA'S WAKE IS

20:58.433 --> 20:59.366
BEING HELD IN FRONT OF THE

20:59.433 --> 21:00.666
DIESEL PUMP AT A WAWA, YOU'RE

21:00.733 --> 21:01.466
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

21:01.533 --> 21:02.966
ATTEND.

21:03.033 --> 21:03.600
AND IT ACTUALLY EXEMPTS THEM

21:03.666 --> 21:05.233
FROM EVEN MORE THAN WHAT HE JUST

21:05.300 --> 21:06.300
SAID.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.533
BECAUSE IT ALSO ALLOWS COMPANIES

21:07.600 --> 21:08.633
TO AVOID PAYING PAYROLL TAXES,

21:08.700 --> 21:09.466
WORKERS' COMP, AND UNEMPLOYMENT

21:09.533 --> 21:10.833
INSURANCE, AS WELL AS THE

21:10.900 --> 21:13.200
MINIMUM WAGE.

21:13.266 --> 21:14.733
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, BEING

21:14.800 --> 21:15.566
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MEANS

21:15.633 --> 21:17.100
ALL THE COSTS AND RISKS OF TRUCK

21:17.166 --> 21:18.066
OWNERSHIP GET PUSHED ONTO THE

21:18.133 --> 21:20.600
DRIVER.

21:20.666 --> 21:21.733
JUST WATCH AS THIS FORMER

21:21.800 --> 21:22.833
TRUCKER EXPLAINS EXACTLY WHAT

21:22.900 --> 21:23.833
WAS LEFT OF HER HOUSEHOLD

21:23.900 --> 21:25.066
EARNINGS, ONCE SHE AND HER

21:25.133 --> 21:26.166
HUSBAND HAD ACCOUNTED FOR ALL

21:26.233 --> 21:28.966
THEIR COSTS.

21:29.033 --> 21:31.000
>> WE MADE $150,000, RIGHT,

21:31.066 --> 21:32.500
IN A YEAR.

21:32.566 --> 21:33.633
THAT SOUNDS GREAT, RIGHT?

21:33.700 --> 21:36.033
THAT'S, LIKE, GOOD MONEY.

21:36.100 --> 21:39.333
WE PAID $100,000 IN FUEL, OKAY?

21:39.400 --> 21:40.733
SO, RIGHT THERE, NOW I MADE

21:40.800 --> 21:42.866
$50,000.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.233
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY, BECAUSE,

21:44.300 --> 21:46.500
YOU KNOW, YOU GET AN OIL CHANGE

21:46.566 --> 21:47.066
EVERY MONTH, SO THAT'S $300

21:47.133 --> 21:47.900
A MONTH.

21:47.966 --> 21:48.500
YOU STILL HAVE TO DO ALL THE

21:48.566 --> 21:50.100
MAINTENANCE.

21:50.166 --> 21:51.466
WE HAD A MOTOR BLOW OUT, RIGHT?

21:51.533 --> 21:54.233
$13,000.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.133
RIGHT?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.500
I KNOW, I MEAN, I CHOKE UP

21:56.566 --> 21:57.266
A LITTLE JUST THINKING ABOUT IT,

21:57.333 --> 22:00.000
BECAUSE IT WAS...

22:00.066 --> 22:01.566
AND IT WAS 13,000, AND WE WERE

22:01.633 --> 22:03.600
OFF WORK FOR TWO WEEKS.

22:03.666 --> 22:05.166
SO, BY THE END OF THE YEAR, WITH

22:05.233 --> 22:07.000
THAT $150,000, BY THE END OF THE

22:07.066 --> 22:10.400
YEAR, WE'D MADE ABOUT $22,000.

22:10.466 --> 22:12.200
YEAH, AND LOOK.

22:12.266 --> 22:13.833
I'M NO CPA, DESPITE THE FACE,

22:13.900 --> 22:15.400
GLASSES, AND INSATIABLE

22:15.466 --> 22:17.400
HORNINESS FOR NUMBERS THAT

22:17.466 --> 22:18.600
STRONGLY IMPLY OTHERWISE, BUT

22:18.666 --> 22:20.233
THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SHITTY

22:20.300 --> 22:21.833
BOTTOM LINE.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.233
AND WHILE MOST OF THE DRIVERS

22:23.300 --> 22:24.066
YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR TONIGHT HAVE

22:24.133 --> 22:25.300
BEEN IN LONG-HAUL, THIS

22:25.366 --> 22:27.566
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR PROBLEM

22:27.633 --> 22:29.400
ALSO VERY MUCH APPLIES TO THOSE

22:29.466 --> 22:30.000
AT EITHER END OF THE SHIPPING

22:30.066 --> 22:31.233
PROCESS, TOO, LIKE

22:31.300 --> 22:32.633
PORT TRUCKERS, WHERE ONE STUDY

22:32.700 --> 22:35.266
ESTIMATED TWO-THIRDS OF THEM

22:35.333 --> 22:36.100
ARE MISCLASSIFIED, AND ALSO

22:36.166 --> 22:38.566
"LAST MILE" DRIVERS.

22:38.633 --> 22:40.166
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE

22:40.233 --> 22:41.200
BOX TRUCKS OR SPRINTER VANS TO

22:41.266 --> 22:41.700
DELIVER STUFF DIRECTLY

22:41.766 --> 22:44.100
TO YOUR DOOR.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.133
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SEE

22:45.200 --> 22:46.433
FEDEX GROUND TRUCKS?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.833
THOSE AREN'T FEDEX EMPLOYEES,

22:48.900 --> 22:49.966
DESPITE EVERY VISUAL INDICATION

22:50.033 --> 22:51.433
TO THE CONTRARY.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.400
THEY MAY WEAR A FEDEX UNIFORM,

22:53.466 --> 22:55.466
THEIR TRUCK MAY SAY FEDEX ON IT,

22:55.533 --> 22:56.666
AND THEY MAY EXCLUSIVELY DELIVER

22:56.733 --> 22:58.433
PACKAGES FOR FEDEX, BUT THEY'RE

22:58.500 --> 23:00.466
TECHNICALLY INDEPENDENT.

23:00.533 --> 23:01.900
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE

23:01.966 --> 23:03.333
SIDE OF THE TRUCKS,

23:03.400 --> 23:04.133
YOU'LL SEE SMALL FINE PRINT

23:04.200 --> 23:05.533
INDICATING WHO ACTUALLY OWNS IT,

23:05.600 --> 23:08.533
AND IT'S NOT FEDEX.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.266
AMAZON USES A SIMILAR MODEL WITH

23:10.333 --> 23:11.966
ITS "DELIVERY SERVICE PARTNERS."

23:12.033 --> 23:13.300
THE APPEAL FOR AMAZON

23:13.366 --> 23:14.933
IS OBVIOUS.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.200
USING DRIVERS THAT AREN'T DIRECT

23:16.266 --> 23:17.100
EMPLOYEES ALLOWS THEM TO

23:17.166 --> 23:19.300
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM

23:19.366 --> 23:22.266
LIABILITY WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.

23:22.333 --> 23:23.866
WHICH THEY DO, PARTICULARLY

23:23.933 --> 23:25.433
GIVEN THE RIDICULOUS PACE AMAZON

23:25.500 --> 23:27.333
EXPECTS.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.066
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ALL THE

23:29.133 --> 23:30.466
STORIES OF DRIVERS HAVING TO

23:30.533 --> 23:32.100
URINATE IN BOTTLES, BECAUSE THEY

23:32.166 --> 23:36.400
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO STOP.

23:36.466 --> 23:37.866
THAT SPEAKS TO THE

23:37.933 --> 23:39.266
RELENTLESS PRESSURE TO DELIVER

23:39.333 --> 23:39.866
RELENTLESS PRESSURE TO DELIVER

23:39.933 --> 23:40.866
HUNDREDS OF PACKAGES PER SHIFT.

23:40.933 --> 23:41.500
>> PEOPLE ARE BUSTING THEIR ASS

23:41.566 --> 23:42.033
DRIVING WAY OVER THE SPEED

23:42.100 --> 23:42.833
LIMIT.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.133
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING THROUGH STOP

23:44.200 --> 23:45.433
SIGNS, RUNNING THROUGH YELLOW

23:45.500 --> 23:46.766
LIGHTS.

23:46.833 --> 23:47.900
EVERYBODY I KNEW WAS BUCKLING

23:47.966 --> 23:50.133
THEIR SEATBELT BEHIND THEIR

23:50.200 --> 23:51.333
BACKS BECAUSE THE TIME IT TOOK

23:51.400 --> 23:52.633
JUST TO BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELT,

23:52.700 --> 23:54.233
UNBUCKLE YOUR SEATBELT EVERY

23:54.300 --> 23:55.366
TIME WAS ENOUGH TIME TO GET YOU

23:55.433 --> 24:00.000
BEHIND SCHEDULE.

24:00.066 --> 24:00.966
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

24:01.033 --> 24:02.266
I THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW THE ONLY

24:02.333 --> 24:03.766
PLACE IT'S FINE NOT TO HAVE

24:03.833 --> 24:04.433
A SEAT BELT IS, FOR SOME REASON,

24:04.500 --> 24:07.800
A SCHOOL BUS.

24:07.866 --> 24:09.266
THAT'S WHERE WE AGREED TO SKIMP

24:09.333 --> 24:10.233
ON THEM AS A SOCIETY.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.366
THE KIDS'LL BE FINE!

24:11.433 --> 24:11.866
WE'LL PUT A LITTLE

24:11.933 --> 24:12.900
STOP SIGN ON THE OUTSIDE!

24:12.966 --> 24:14.866
THEY'LL BE FINE!

24:14.933 --> 24:17.000
AND IF YOU THINK THAT NONSTOP

24:17.066 --> 24:19.200
PRESSURE SEEMS LIKE AN ACCIDENT

24:19.266 --> 24:20.166
WAITING TO HAPPEN,

24:20.233 --> 24:21.133
IT ALREADY HAS.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.033
INVESTIGATIONS BY PROPUBLICA

24:22.100 --> 24:23.366
AND BUZZFEED FOUND THAT,

24:23.433 --> 24:24.666
IN A FOUR-YEAR WINDOW,

24:24.733 --> 24:25.733
DRIVERS DELIVERING AMAZON

24:25.800 --> 24:26.466
PACKAGES HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN

24:26.533 --> 24:28.500
MORE THAN 60 CRASHES THAT LED TO

24:28.566 --> 24:29.266
SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING

24:29.333 --> 24:31.900
13 DEATHS.

24:31.966 --> 24:33.633
OR, AS THAT'S MORE COMMONLY

24:33.700 --> 24:35.933
KNOWN, A BEZOS' DOZEN.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.166
AMAZON IS BASICALLY

24:37.233 --> 24:38.833
OFF THE HOOK HERE, BECAUSE THESE

24:38.900 --> 24:41.600
DRIVERS AREN'T THEIR EMPLOYEES,

24:41.666 --> 24:43.033
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.300
MEANING THE CONTRACTOR IS

24:44.366 --> 24:45.800
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT

24:45.866 --> 24:47.533
GOES WRONG, NOT THEM.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.933
IN FACT, UNDER AMAZON'S

24:49.000 --> 24:49.666
CONTRACTS, THEY'RE EVEN

24:49.733 --> 24:50.800
REPORTEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

24:50.866 --> 24:52.600
PAYING AMAZON'S LEGAL BILLS

24:52.666 --> 24:54.266
IN THE EVENT OF A LAWSUIT,

24:54.333 --> 24:57.066
WHICH IS ONLY FAIR.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.800
IT'S NOT LIKE JEFF BEZOS CAN

24:58.866 --> 25:00.466
AFFORD TO PAY ALL THOSE LAWYERS.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.600
HE'S SPENDING HIS MONEY ON

25:01.666 --> 25:02.666
THINGS THAT TRULY BENEFIT

25:02.733 --> 25:05.366
SOCIETY, LIKE LAUNCHING HIMSELF

25:05.433 --> 25:07.366
INTO SPACE BEFORE DISAPPOINTING

25:07.433 --> 25:09.800
EVERYONE AND COMING BACK SAFELY.

25:09.866 --> 25:11.600
AND AMAZINGLY, I'VE GOT ONE MORE

25:11.666 --> 25:12.766
EXPLOITATIVE QUIRK OF THIS

25:12.833 --> 25:14.233
INDUSTRY TO SHOW YOU.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.033
AND IT'S SOMETHING CALLED LEASE

25:15.100 --> 25:16.533
PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.366
THIS IS A SYSTEM WHERE DRIVERS

25:18.433 --> 25:20.366
WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR OWN

25:20.433 --> 25:21.866
TRUCK ARE OFFERED THE CHANCE TO

25:21.933 --> 25:23.700
LEASE ONE FROM THE COMPANY THEY

25:23.766 --> 25:24.366
DRIVE FOR WITH THE PROMISE THAT

25:24.433 --> 25:25.000
THEY'LL EARN ENOUGH TO

25:25.066 --> 25:25.566
EVENTUALLY PAY IT OFF

25:25.633 --> 25:27.700
AND OWN IT.

25:27.766 --> 25:28.433
HERE'S ONE COMPANY GIVING YOU

25:28.500 --> 25:29.400
THE HARD SELL.

25:29.466 --> 25:30.100
>> OWN YOUR FUTURE

AND EARNING POWER WITH TRUCK

25:33.900 --> 25:35.400
OWNERSHIP!

25:35.466 --> 25:36.633
WESTERN'S LEASE-PURCHASE PROGRAM

25:36.700 --> 25:38.100
IS LIKE NO OTHER.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.566
THERE'S NO MONEY DOWN, NO CREDIT

25:39.633 --> 25:40.833
CHECK, AND NO BALLOON PAYMENTS.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.133
AT WESTERN EXPRESS, WE DELIVER

25:42.200 --> 25:43.200
INDEPENDENCE, ONE DRIVER

25:43.266 --> 25:45.900
AT A TIME!

25:45.966 --> 25:47.800
OKAY, I'M IMMEDIATELY

25:47.866 --> 25:49.066
SUSPICIOUS OF PHRASES LIKE

25:49.133 --> 25:50.400
"OWN YOUR FUTURE"

25:50.466 --> 25:52.500
AND "FIND YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL."

25:52.566 --> 25:53.500
COMPANIES WITH SELLING POINTS

25:53.566 --> 25:54.600
LIKE THAT TYPICALLY LEAVE YOU

25:54.666 --> 25:55.600
WITH NOTHING BUT DEBT

25:55.666 --> 25:57.400
AND A CLOSET FULL OF LEGGINGS

25:57.466 --> 25:59.366
DESIGNED TO TURN YOUR CROTCH

25:59.433 --> 26:01.033
INTO A MAGIC EYE POSTER.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.800
AND THE FACT IS, DRIVERS WHO

26:02.866 --> 26:03.866
PARTICIPATE IN LEASE-TO-OWN

26:03.933 --> 26:06.500
AGREEMENTS ALMOST NEVER SUCCEED.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.600
ONE TRUCKING COMPANY EXECUTIVE

26:07.666 --> 26:08.900
EVEN ESTIMATED THAT, OF ALL THE

26:09.000 --> 26:10.400
DRIVERS ENTERING INTO THEIR

26:10.466 --> 26:11.633
LEASE-PURCHASE PROGRAM,

26:11.700 --> 26:14.466
ONLY AROUND 5 TO 10% ACTUALLY

26:14.533 --> 26:16.233
ENDED UP SUCCESSFULLY TAKING

26:16.300 --> 26:17.866
OWNERSHIP OF THE TRUCK.

26:17.933 --> 26:18.466
SO THE ODDS ARE HEAVILY

26:18.533 --> 26:20.000
AGAINST YOU.

26:20.066 --> 26:20.600
AND AS FOR THE WHOLE

26:20.666 --> 26:23.000
"DELIVERING INDEPENDENCE" PART,

26:23.066 --> 26:25.000
THAT'S THE REAL IRONY.

26:25.066 --> 26:27.066
IF YOU'RE LEASING A TRUCK FROM

26:27.133 --> 26:28.266
THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR, YOU'RE

26:28.333 --> 26:28.900
NOW TETHERED TO THEM,

26:28.966 --> 26:30.633
NO MATTER WHAT.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.100
YOU'RE RELIANT ON THEM TO GIVE

26:32.166 --> 26:33.866
YOU LOADS, TO EARN MONEY, WHICH

26:33.933 --> 26:34.633
YOU'RE THEN PAYING BACK TO THEM

26:34.700 --> 26:36.733
TO PAY OFF YOUR LEASE, AND ALL

26:36.800 --> 26:39.200
THE OTHER EXPENSES THEY CAN

26:39.266 --> 26:39.766
THROW AT YOU.

26:39.833 --> 26:40.600
THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON PROBLEM

26:40.666 --> 26:41.266
FOR BOTH LONG-HAUL AND PORT

26:41.333 --> 26:43.033
TRUCKERS.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.700
>> IT TAKES DRIVERS UNTIL --

26:44.766 --> 26:45.733
EACH WEEK, THEY GET PAID EACH

26:45.800 --> 26:47.200
WEEK -- AND IT CAN TAKE THEM

26:47.266 --> 26:48.066
UNTIL WEDNESDAY OR EVEN THURSDAY

26:48.133 --> 26:49.233
BEFORE THEY EVEN BEGIN

26:49.300 --> 26:51.300
TO MAKE $100.

26:51.366 --> 26:52.500
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

26:52.566 --> 26:53.700
BECAUSE THE COMPANY CHARGES THEM

26:53.766 --> 26:55.266
TO USE THE COMPANY TRUCK.

26:55.333 --> 26:56.433
THEY CHARGE THEM TO MAINTAIN THE

26:56.500 --> 26:59.033
COMPANY TRUCK, TO BUY NEW TIRES,

26:59.100 --> 26:59.666
THEY EVEN CHARGE THESE GUYS TO

26:59.733 --> 27:00.633
PARK THE COMPANY TRUCK AT THE

27:00.700 --> 27:02.833
COMPANY YARD OVERNIGHT.

27:02.900 --> 27:03.433
THEY DON'T -- THEY CAN'T EVEN

27:03.500 --> 27:04.733
TAKE IT HOME.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.600
OH, IT GETS WORSE.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.900
IN ONE CASE, A COMPANY EVEN

27:06.966 --> 27:14.033
CHARGED $2 PER WEEK FOR THE

27:14.100 --> 27:15.466
TOILET PAPER

27:15.533 --> 27:16.366
ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAD A DRIVER

27:16.433 --> 27:16.966
TO ACTUALLY OWE THEIR COMPANY

27:17.033 --> 27:17.633
MONEY AT THE END OF A WORK WEEK.

27:17.700 --> 27:18.633
CAN YOU IMAGINE PICKING UP YOUR

27:18.700 --> 27:19.666
PAYCHECK AND FINDING A ENVELOPE

27:19.733 --> 27:20.233
FULL OF NEGATIVE

27:20.300 --> 27:24.266
$5 BILLS?

27:24.333 --> 27:25.400
YOU'D BE ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS.

27:25.466 --> 27:25.966
AND YES, THAT IS JOHN WILKES

27:26.033 --> 27:26.533
BOOTH ON THE NEGATIVE FIVE,

27:26.600 --> 27:27.566
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

27:27.633 --> 27:30.233
HE CANCELS OUT A LINCOLN.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.566
JUST LIKE HOW AARON BURR

27:31.633 --> 27:33.133
IS ON THE NEGATIVE TEN, AND THE

27:33.200 --> 27:34.733
NEGATIVE HUNDRED FEATURES THE

27:34.800 --> 27:35.800
72 OUNCE STEAK BEN FRANKLIN

27:35.866 --> 27:36.466
CHOKED ON WHILE TRYING TO WIN

27:36.533 --> 27:38.333
A T-SHIRT.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.600
LEARN YOUR HISTORY.

27:40.666 --> 27:41.200
SO DRIVERS ARE BASICALLY STUCK

27:41.266 --> 27:42.666
HERE.

27:42.733 --> 27:44.100
IF THEY STAY WITH THE COMPANY,

27:44.166 --> 27:44.633
THEY CAN END UP SCRAPING

27:44.700 --> 27:45.900
TO GET BY.

27:45.966 --> 27:47.666
BUT IF THEY LEAVE, THEY RISK

27:47.733 --> 27:49.166
LOSING THE TRUCK THEY'VE POURED

27:49.233 --> 27:50.566
SO MUCH INTO, AS MOST

27:50.633 --> 27:52.300
LEASE-TO-OWN AGREEMENTS

27:52.366 --> 27:54.166
STIPULATE THAT IF THE DRIVER

27:54.233 --> 27:55.500
LEAVES THE COMPANY, IT CAN TAKE

27:55.566 --> 27:56.866
BACK THE TRUCK, LEAVING THE

27:56.933 --> 27:58.366
DRIVER WITH NOTHING.

27:58.433 --> 27:59.866
IT'S FRANKLY NO SURPRISE

27:59.933 --> 28:01.366
MULTIPLE TRUCKING COMPANIES HAVE

28:01.433 --> 28:03.033
SETTLED OVER ACCUSATIONS BROUGHT

28:03.100 --> 28:03.800
BY DRIVERS WHO FOUND THEIR

28:03.866 --> 28:04.500
LEASE-TO-OWN AGREEMENTS

28:04.566 --> 28:05.233
PREDATORY.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.833
IN FACT, WESTERN EXPRESS,

28:06.900 --> 28:09.800
THE "OWN YOUR FUTURE" COMPANY,

28:09.866 --> 28:11.500
IS AWAITING COURT SIGNOFF OF

28:11.566 --> 28:13.033
A $15 MILLION CLASS-ACTION

28:13.100 --> 28:14.733
SETTLEMENT RIGHT NOW.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.200
AND I KNOW AT LEAST ONE PERSON

28:16.266 --> 28:17.733
WHO MIGHT BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.133
BECAUSE JUST WATCH

28:18.200 --> 28:23.166
THIS FORMER WESTERN EXPRESS

28:23.233 --> 28:29.033
DRIVER TALKING ABOUT

28:29.100 --> 28:29.633
HOW SHE'D FELT MISLED AFTER

28:29.700 --> 28:30.700
OPENING A PAYCHECK

28:30.766 --> 28:31.333
THAT CAME TO, AFTER ALL THE

28:31.400 --> 28:32.633
COMPANY'S DEDUCTIONS, JUST $293.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.333
>> I'M PISSED THE FUCK OFF

28:33.400 --> 28:34.033
IF I HAD THE STRENGTH TO PICK

28:34.100 --> 28:34.666
THIS TRUCK UP AND THROW IT

28:34.733 --> 28:37.400
STRAIGHT TO MARS, I WOULD.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.733
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE RECRUITERS

28:38.800 --> 28:39.333
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU THEY

28:39.400 --> 28:42.900
FUCKING LYING.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.600
LEASE PURCHASE HERE IS A LIE.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.000
YEAH.

28:46.066 --> 28:47.133
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING

28:47.200 --> 28:48.766
PEOPLE AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO

28:48.833 --> 28:50.566
HURL A SEMI TRUCK TO MARS,

28:50.633 --> 28:51.666
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE, NASA WOULD

28:51.733 --> 28:53.033
HAVE TO PLAN THEIR ROVER

28:53.100 --> 28:54.433
MISSIONS AROUND THE

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
CONSTANT RAIN OF 35,000-POUND

28:56.566 --> 28:58.000
DEBT TRAPS.

28:58.066 --> 29:00.200
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

29:00.266 --> 29:02.033
WELL, FIRST, WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE

29:02.100 --> 29:03.333
THAT WE'VE ALL GOTTEN USED TO

29:03.400 --> 29:04.733
THE IDEA OF FREE, NEXT-DAY

29:04.800 --> 29:06.033
SHIPPING BUT, CRUCIALLY,

29:06.100 --> 29:08.766
SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, ALWAYS PAYS

29:08.833 --> 29:09.033
THE PRICE.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.300
SECOND, THE WORK ARRANGEMENTS

29:11.366 --> 29:12.366
DRIVERS ENDURE, AND THE

29:12.433 --> 29:13.900
FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF VALUE PLACED

29:13.966 --> 29:14.500
ON THEIR TIME, CLEARLY NEED TO

29:14.566 --> 29:16.800
BE ADDRESSED.

29:16.866 --> 29:17.600
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,

29:17.666 --> 29:18.266
THE DEPARTMENT OF

29:18.333 --> 29:21.166
TRANSPORTATION, WITH THE

29:21.233 --> 29:22.000
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

29:22.066 --> 29:23.133
ARE SET TO EXAMINE THE TYPE

29:23.200 --> 29:23.700
OF PREDATORY TRUCK LEASING

29:23.766 --> 29:24.533
ARRANGEMENTS WE JUST TALKED

29:24.600 --> 29:26.166
ABOUT AND ALSO PLAN TO STUDY THE

29:26.233 --> 29:26.766
ISSUE OF DRIVER PAY AND UNPAID

29:26.833 --> 29:28.233
WAITING TIMES.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.033
AND HOPEFULLY, THEY WON'T JUST

29:31.100 --> 29:33.633
STUDY IT BUT ACTUALLY DO

29:33.700 --> 29:34.666
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

29:34.733 --> 29:35.933
BECAUSE THE KEY WAY TO STOP THIS

29:36.000 --> 29:38.066
SO-CALLED "SHORTAGE" OF DRIVERS

29:38.133 --> 29:39.933
THAT WE'VE HAD FOR YEARS NOW IS

29:40.000 --> 29:40.933
TO MAKE THIS A JOB PEOPLE

29:41.000 --> 29:42.966
ACTUALLY WANT TO STAY IN.

29:43.033 --> 29:46.933
AND UNTIL WE MAKE BIG CHANGES,

29:47.000 --> 29:47.966
THE VERY LEAST WE CAN DO IS MAKE

29:48.033 --> 29:49.500
OUR TRUCKING REALITY SHOWS MORE

29:49.566 --> 29:51.166
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT LIFE ON THE

29:51.233 --> 29:53.300
ROAD FOR SO MANY DRIVERS IS

29:53.366 --> 29:58.033
ACTUALLY LIKE.

29:58.100 --> 30:02.033
>> TRUCKS!

30:02.100 --> 30:03.700
THE LIFEBLOOD OF AMERICA.

30:03.766 --> 30:05.833
THEY FLOW ACROSS OUR HIGHWAYS

30:05.900 --> 30:06.800
DRIVEN BY PEOPLE TOUGH ENOUGH TO

30:06.866 --> 30:12.166
DO ONE OF THE GRITTIEST JOBS ON

30:12.233 --> 30:13.200
EARTH.

30:13.266 --> 30:14.666
>> THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN

30:14.733 --> 30:14.833
DIE.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.333
>> FROM THE MAKERS OF ICE ROAD

30:17.400 --> 30:19.033
TRUCKERS AND WORLDS TOUGHEST

30:19.100 --> 30:21.833
TRUCKER COMES THOUGH

30:21.900 --> 30:23.833
REALITY SHOW.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.366
WATCH THE DRIVERS GO UP AGAINST

30:26.433 --> 30:28.366
BIG ODDS, TOUGH WEATHER, BUMPY

30:28.433 --> 30:31.400
ROADS, HARD-CORE BUDGETING.

30:31.466 --> 30:34.800
>> 14 GRAND FOR THE ENGINE.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.700
FUEL.

30:36.766 --> 30:37.033
OIL CHANGE.

30:37.100 --> 30:40.100
>> DON'T FORGET THE NEW TIRES.

30:40.166 --> 30:43.533
>> RIGHT.

30:43.600 --> 30:43.700
GOD.

30:43.766 --> 30:45.700
>> OH, YEAH.

30:45.766 --> 30:48.333
THESE ROAD DOGS HAVE DIESEL IN

30:48.400 --> 30:50.233
THEIR BLOOD AND THEY ARE LIVING

30:50.300 --> 30:50.666
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

30:50.733 --> 30:52.100
>> IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING A

30:52.166 --> 30:52.900
COWBOY.

30:52.966 --> 30:54.866
I'M INDEPENDENT SO I'VE GOT MY

30:54.933 --> 30:55.333
FREEDOM.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.900
I'VE JUST GOT TO HAUL WHAT MY

30:56.966 --> 30:58.700
COMPANY TELLS ME, WHERE THEY

30:58.766 --> 31:01.600
TELL ME, DURING THE HOURS THAT

31:01.666 --> 31:03.333
THEY SPECIFY COME IN A TRUCK I

31:03.400 --> 31:04.833
PAID FOR AND DO NOT OWN.

31:04.900 --> 31:11.666
BUT ON THE PLUS SIGN.

31:11.733 --> 31:14.033
>> THERE IS NO SLOWING DOWN FOR

31:14.100 --> 31:15.700
THESE ROAD WARRIORS BECAUSE IN

31:15.766 --> 31:16.633
THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY, EVERY

31:16.700 --> 31:19.733
MINUTE COUNTS.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.266
EXCEPT DURING LOADING AND

31:22.333 --> 31:23.800
UNLOADING.

31:23.866 --> 31:26.933
>> FUCK.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.300
STAYING IT.

31:29.366 --> 31:31.200
>> THOSE HOURS ARE NOT

31:31.266 --> 31:31.500
COMPENSATED.

31:31.566 --> 31:32.733
>> IS THIS YOUR CARD?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.066
>> YES.

31:34.133 --> 31:36.533
THIS SHOW BRINGS YOU ALL THE

31:36.600 --> 31:36.966
THRILLS.

31:37.033 --> 31:42.866
>> THAT IS PISS.

31:42.933 --> 31:45.933
>> IS THIS THE CHARGE FOR

31:46.000 --> 31:46.733
COMPANY TOILET PAPER?

31:46.800 --> 31:49.066
>> THE ROMANCE OF LIFE ON THE

31:49.133 --> 31:49.266
ROAD.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.666
>> I MISS MY WIFE.

31:52.733 --> 31:53.766
>> THE ACTION LITERALLY NEVER

31:53.833 --> 31:53.966
STOPS.

31:54.033 --> 31:56.300
>> DISPATCH.

31:56.366 --> 31:58.133
I AM NOT SAFE TO DRIVE RIGHT

31:58.200 --> 31:58.933
NOW.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.266
I AM FALLING ASLEEP.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.466
>> ROGER THAT, DRIVER.

32:01.533 --> 32:04.466
WHY DON'T YOU PULL OVER, LIE

32:04.533 --> 32:09.266
DOWN IN THE BACK, GO AHEAD AND

32:09.333 --> 32:10.233
FUCK YOURSELF.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.633
>> I AM WORRIED SOMEONE COULD

32:11.700 --> 32:11.900
GET HURT.

32:11.966 --> 32:14.400
>> ALL, SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.066
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS TALKING

32:16.133 --> 32:19.433
TO A DRAMA QUEEN.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.466
OH, THE DRIVER.

32:22.533 --> 32:24.433
TO DRIVE OR NOT TO DRIVE, THAT

32:24.500 --> 32:26.100
IS THE QUESTION.

32:26.166 --> 32:27.933
WHAT IS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO

32:28.000 --> 32:30.133
SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF

32:30.200 --> 32:31.333
OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE OR TAKE ARMS

32:31.400 --> 32:33.066
AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES.

32:33.133 --> 32:33.933
THAT'S YOU.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.233
THAT'S WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE.

32:36.300 --> 32:40.100
>> YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT OF

32:40.166 --> 32:41.466
HAMLET VERBATIM.

32:41.533 --> 32:43.666
>> GET BACK ON THE FUCKING ROAD.

32:43.733 --> 32:45.066
>> HELL YEAH.

32:45.133 --> 32:46.800
GET READY FOR 100% EXCITEMENT,

32:46.866 --> 32:54.133
100% ADRENALINE, AND 100% [

32:54.466 --> 32:56.100
>> IT'S NOT JUST TRUCKERS.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.733
THIS SHOW BRINGS YOU EVERY ONE

32:57.800 --> 33:00.666
FROM THE DRIVERS TO THE COMPANY

33:00.733 --> 33:00.900
OWNERS.

33:00.966 --> 33:03.333
>> OWNERS IS A PRETTY STRONG

33:03.400 --> 33:03.533
TERM.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.566
WE HAVE MUCH MORE CASUAL

33:05.633 --> 33:06.233
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR TRUCKS.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.200
NO LABELS.

33:09.266 --> 33:11.600
I MEAN, WHY COMPLICATE THINGS?

33:11.666 --> 33:12.000
I'M HAVING FUN.

33:12.066 --> 33:14.666
YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

33:14.733 --> 33:17.100
>> THIS PAYCHECK SAYS I OWE YOU

33:17.166 --> 33:17.600
MONEY.

33:17.666 --> 33:21.400
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

33:21.466 --> 33:22.300
BOOYAH.

33:22.366 --> 33:23.800
DO YOU HAVE THE CASH?

33:23.866 --> 33:25.166

33:25.233 --> 33:27.733
YOU AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET TO

33:27.800 --> 33:28.266
THE TRUCKER LIFE WITHOUT
