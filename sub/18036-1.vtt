01:14.707 --> 01:16.106
Grab it, Lu.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.135
Give me that stick.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.576
Drop.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.517
Drop.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.580
Drop it.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.850
That's a girl. That's a girl.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.350
Drop it. Good dog.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.653
Lucy.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.677
Come on back, girl.

03:02.815 --> 03:03.679
WENDY and LUCY

03:03.783 --> 03:05.512
<i>Lu, where did you go?</i>

04:43.449 --> 04:45.417
Great dog, what's her name?

04:45.752 --> 04:46.776
Lucy.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.409
You're a sweetheart, Lucy!

04:48.921 --> 04:50.081
What is she?

04:50.423 --> 04:54.621
Don't know, really. A mix of
hunting dog and retriever.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.057
Where's the closest store around here?

05:00.366 --> 05:02.527
I don't know. I'm not from around here.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.999
I'm just kinda passing through.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.332
Where to?

05:06.639 --> 05:08.470
Going to Alaska.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.639
I'm headed south.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.541
Icky over there worked the canneries last year.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.908
Hey, Icky! This lady's going to Alaska!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.078
King Salmon!

05:22.388 --> 05:25.084
It's fucking awesome up there. You going to work?

05:25.391 --> 05:26.949
Where you going?

05:27.660 --> 05:28.820
Ketchikan.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.459
Ketchikan.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.824
It's good for greenhorns. Cooper River
is pretty good, too. Further north.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.401
Lots of work on that slime line.

05:37.537 --> 05:42.406
You should check out Northwestern Fisheries
because their housing is fucking awesome.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.535
Tell Mike Murphy you met me, because he's all right.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.371
Okay, I might. Thanks.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.874
The money's better there, too.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.110
There's no expenses, you know?
You just walk with everything.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.989
Well, whatever you do...

05:58.491 --> 06:01.688
...don't tell Old Man Brutus that you met me.

06:01.894 --> 06:06.524
Because he was a little upset when
I left in somewhat of a hurry.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.996
There was this incident...

06:08.134 --> 06:11.865
...involving me operating a two ton earth mover...

06:12.004 --> 06:14.564
...in a state slightly less than sober.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.535
Some friends of mine...

06:17.844 --> 06:19.106
...they were goofing around...

06:19.412 --> 06:23.542
...and we got the thing started, and
I put it in gear and that was that.

06:23.683 --> 06:26.584
We drove the thing across the construction site.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.450
Getting it to stop, though. No one told me that.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.023
So, we finally had to jump off...

06:32.158 --> 06:34.820
...and the thing just rolled all the
way across the construction site.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.191
We couldn't stop the thing. We tried everything.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.556
It snapped the retaining wires.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.167
Huge spray of sparks.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.595
The Cat went over the hill head over heels...

06:45.738 --> 06:47.831
...ass over tit, right into the water.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.899
It was probably a hundred thousand-dollar piece
of equipment, gone in four fucking seconds.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.478
But they couldn't pin it on me, man, I was gone.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.933
Ferry Running Times NORTHWESTERN

08:11.724 --> 08:13.521
Good night, baby girl.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.025
Wake up.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.868
Ma'am.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.782
You can't sleep here, ma'am.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.142
You can't sleep out here, it's not allowed.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.777
Okay.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.315
All right, get back, Lu.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.207
My car won't start.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.179
I can hear that.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.920
You can't park here. That's the rules.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.751
Yeah, I got it, I got it, okay?

09:55.361 --> 09:58.797
I don't know what it is. It was fine yesterday.

09:59.298 --> 10:02.028
You just gonna have to get it off the property.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.232
Well, where is that? How far is the property?

10:08.374 --> 10:11.810
Street. The street's public. You
just have to get it off the lot.

10:19.852 --> 10:20.944
All right, jump in.

10:45.845 --> 10:46.971
Lu!

10:47.413 --> 10:49.973
What do you know about that...

10:50.149 --> 10:51.878
...station over there?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.949
Seems to get business. A lot of cars come and go.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.248
He's the closest. He's got that going for him.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.418
What about, is there some kind
of grocery store around here?

11:01.727 --> 11:03.422
Down the road there's Jack's.

11:03.729 --> 11:07.165
Pretty good and pretty cheap.
That's where I normally go.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.871
Stay, Lu.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.009
Hey, Lu.

13:10.222 --> 13:11.211
Look.

13:33.946 --> 13:34.935
I know.

13:36.415 --> 13:37.609
I know.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.647
Okay. Be right back.

15:28.127 --> 15:31.096
You're hungry, huh? Bet you are.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.959
Come on, let's go.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.756
I can't shut up, I'm choking.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.719
So I said, man, I ain't staying there, I'm going.

16:03.996 --> 16:08.456
Yeah, like one out of what?
Is there like ten of us here?

16:08.600 --> 16:12.559
Found a few cans and then I
went to this place over here...

16:12.705 --> 16:14.764
...and laid down under a tree and went to sleep.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.096
Lu.

16:17.009 --> 16:17.998
Sit here.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.610
There's a long line.

16:19.745 --> 16:24.011
I think some of these machines are
broken today, so it's gonna be a while.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.514
Why don't you buy her cans from her?

16:25.684 --> 16:28.175
I don't have any money to buy her cans from her.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.687
But, hey, I tell you what, I'll take those. Hey, dog.

16:31.790 --> 16:35.521
I'll take those from you and
I'll give you the money later.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.323
I mean, you've only got....

16:41.433 --> 16:44.493
It's not many cans. It's not worth the wait.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.297
I'll find you later.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.202
Okay, you can just take those. That's fine.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.332
-Are you sure? -Yeah, that's fine.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.239
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.274
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.081
Don't bother anybody, okay?

17:00.652 --> 17:02.586
Be right back with a treat.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.079
Hey.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.089
What did I say?

17:14.532 --> 17:17.593
Don't be a nuisance. We don't need that.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.782
Hey, Lu.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.221
-Excuse me? Ma'am?
-Let go of me.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.655
-I think you're forgetting something.
-Let go of me.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.217
-But you have something.
-Let go of me.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.256
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step inside the store, okay?

19:33.639 --> 19:35.368
Sit here, please.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.906
What's going on, Andy?

19:37.376 --> 19:40.971
This customer neglected to pay for a few items.

19:41.813 --> 19:45.271
I watched the whole thing. I saw
her since she came in the store.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.818
No. I'm sorry, that isn't true.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.818
Okay, well, what are we talking about here?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.687
Excuse me.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.956
Sir, I wasn't done shopping yet.

20:03.569 --> 20:07.528
I walked out of the door by accident
without paying for those cans...

20:07.706 --> 20:11.403
...because I was going to check on my dog.
My dog is tied up in front of the store.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.534
Mr. Hunt, it was obvious what was going on here.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.476
Sir, your employee has the wrong idea.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.877
The rules apply to everyone equally.

20:26.425 --> 20:30.418
If a person can't afford dog food
they shouldn't have a dog.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.688
Andy.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.693
Sir, I just made a mistake is all. I'm very sorry.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.435
This isn't gonna happen again. I'm really very sorry.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.234
The food is not the issue. It's
about setting an example, right?

20:43.408 --> 20:46.468
I'm not from around here, sir, I can't be an example.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.013
We have a policy, ma'am.

21:04.796 --> 21:08.755
Hi, this is Andy Mooney from Jack's on Lombard.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.048
Sir, my dog is tied up out front.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.928
-Sir, my dog is tied up outside.
-Just relax.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.864
Face forward.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.775
Left. Turn to your left.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.551
Can I get my bag back?

23:14.126 --> 23:15.593
Not yet.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.565
This machine's gonna kill me.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.892
We've got to do this again.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.732
Okay.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.039
Fifty dollars.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.447
Excuse me?

24:10.949 --> 24:15.181
You can pay your fine now or you can come
back in two weeks for a trial with a judge.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.547
Then you can pay the 50 dollars plus court fees.

24:21.026 --> 24:23.824
I don't live here. I'm just passing through.

24:24.529 --> 24:28.522
If you get stopped in another state you're
just gonna end up right back here.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.930
You could use a credit card.

24:43.682 --> 24:44.979
Cash.

Lucy!

25:56.821 --> 25:58.118
Lu!

26:01.192 --> 26:03.023
Has anyone seen a dog?

26:04.062 --> 26:08.556
Excuse me. Has anyone seen a dog?
She was tied out front this morning.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.157
Yellow-gold.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.661
You mean like a German Shepherd or something?

26:13.838 --> 26:16.864
Medium sized, yellow-gold in color.

26:17.776 --> 26:21.041
I kind of remember seeing a white van take a dog.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.214
You do? What time was that?

26:23.348 --> 26:24.906
Around noon?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.948
Noon? You didn't even start work until two.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.347
Could have been later.

26:29.654 --> 26:32.145
Excuse me, a white van, like a city van?

26:32.257 --> 26:34.589
I don't know. I could be totally wrong.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.160
She didn't see anything.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.585
Lucy!

26:41.866 --> 26:43.094
Lu!

26:51.910 --> 26:52.934
Lucy!

26:54.913 --> 26:56.175
Come here, Lu!

26:56.881 --> 26:58.246
Lucy!

27:03.688 --> 27:05.280
Lucy, come out now!

27:07.192 --> 27:08.921
What are you doing here?

27:09.961 --> 27:12.953
Looking for my dog. She's
gone. I hope you're real happy.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.258
Lucy, come!

27:35.387 --> 27:36.411
Lucy!

27:41.426 --> 27:44.862
Come on, girl. Come on out, girl! Come on, Lu!

27:47.732 --> 27:49.723
Yeah, have a great night, okay?

27:55.173 --> 27:57.733
You know, your son is a real hero!

27:58.777 --> 28:00.039
Lucy!

28:00.712 --> 28:02.304
Come now!

28:07.952 --> 28:09.010
Lucy!

28:54.232 --> 28:56.223
Have you seen my dog?

28:57.368 --> 28:59.802
Not since I saw you. Nope.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.338
Is that fucking garage ever open?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.180
Most days. Yep.

29:18.056 --> 29:21.958
Is there a pound around here? There's
gotta be a pound close by, huh?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.756
Not too far.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.258
You all right, honey?

29:30.268 --> 29:32.793
Yeah. I just need to get to the pound now.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.527
Well, that's easy.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.007
You just take the street right here.

29:38.376 --> 29:43.006
Go straight down till it dead ends that way about...

29:43.148 --> 29:46.447
...just right till it dead ends, then
you head right about three miles.

29:47.886 --> 29:49.820
You lose your dog, is that it?

29:49.988 --> 29:50.977
Yeah...

29:53.558 --> 29:55.082
...that's what it looks like.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.887
That's a shame. Somewhere around here?

29:58.863 --> 30:00.455
Yeah, that store.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.065
Jack's?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.393
I'm sure someone's got her.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.828
She couldn't have gotten too far.

30:08.006 --> 30:09.997
I was gone kind of a long time.

30:10.241 --> 30:13.870
I'm sure it wasn't that long. She'll turn up.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.241
Okay.

30:25.590 --> 30:29.617
So I just go down this street,
and then I take a right?

30:30.128 --> 30:33.529
I'm pretty sure it's closed now. You'll
probably have to wait untill morning.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.330
But you know, you can get the
number four right here on the corner.

30:36.434 --> 30:39.335
It will take you right there. Starts at six a.m.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.598
I think I'm just gonna head there now.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.504
It's definitely closed.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.075
Well, fucking Christ!

30:52.884 --> 30:56.047
Well, if she's there she'll be there
in the morning, won't she?

30:56.154 --> 30:58.645
A night in the pound never hurt anyone.

31:03.628 --> 31:07.064
You know, there's a good hotel
down the road. The Palms.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.393
Really good clean rooms.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.973
If I see anything I'll let you know.

31:27.485 --> 31:28.884
<Hello? >

31:29.220 --> 31:30.551
Hey, Dan.

31:31.422 --> 31:34.687
<Wendy? Hold on, let me turn down the TV. >

31:38.396 --> 31:39.658
<Where are you?>

31:41.165 --> 31:42.655

31:43.668 --> 31:45.101

31:46.170 --> 31:48.900
Yeah, kind of, sort of. On and off.

31:50.508 --> 31:51.941
<So what's up? >

31:53.678 --> 31:58.274
Nothing. I'm just calling. Just, you know, just....

32:00.151 --> 32:01.448
<Nothing?>

32:04.455 --> 32:06.047
The car broke.

32:07.258 --> 32:10.716
I don't know. It's kind of bad here, actually.

32:13.364 --> 32:15.355
Lucy's lost.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.928
<Who's that? >

32:18.069 --> 32:20.299
<It's your sister. She broke down in Oregon.>

32:20.471 --> 32:21.699
Hi Deb.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.167
<Oregon? What does she want us to do about it?>

32:27.145 --> 32:29.636
Nothing. I'm just calling.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.715
<She's just calling.>

32:32.517 --> 32:35.714
<We can't do anything. We're strapped.
I don't know what she wants.>

32:36.020 --> 32:38.181
I don't want anything. I'm just calling.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.257
<I can't talk with everyone on the phone. >

32:40.458 --> 32:43.985
<I'll talk to you when you're
done with Dan. Bye, honey.>

32:45.496 --> 32:47.020
<Everything's all right? >

32:48.466 --> 32:49.763
Yeah. Everything's great.

32:51.302 --> 32:55.295
You kind of sound like you're busy
over there, so I'm gonna call you later.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.135
<All right, if everything's fine. See ya.>

32:58.309 --> 32:59.640
Yeah, see ya, bye.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.134
Lu!

34:05.243 --> 34:06.710
Luce!

34:19.424 --> 34:21.619
I was usually like the only white person there.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.620
That's so weird.

34:24.762 --> 34:26.195
Why does that girl hate you so much?

34:26.397 --> 34:31.164
I saw the cheerleading squad. Madison's
got some chunky cheerleaders.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.795
Dude, fuck, there's a lady in there!

34:35.773 --> 34:37.239
Your mom's always tired.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.739
Yeah, my mom's like, always, always....

34:51.656 --> 34:53.317
Just a minute!

35:14.779 --> 35:15.837
<Good morning. Hello, Amy.>

35:16.180 --> 35:17.169
<Hello, Mike.>

35:18.349 --> 35:19.816
<What is going on with the traffic? >

35:20.118 --> 35:24.555
<Well, we have activity on Northeast 53rd
Avenue between Gleason and Irving...>

35:24.689 --> 35:25.883
<...so it is closed.>

35:51.716 --> 35:53.707
<She's medium sized.>

35:54.252 --> 35:55.719
39 pounds.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.320
Yellow-gold in color. Her name is Lucy.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.522
I left her tied up to a post and then when
I got back she wasn't there anymore.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.925
Well, I don't see anything here that matches.

36:07.231 --> 36:11.429
But come on, let's go take a look in the
back. You never know. Okay? Follow me.

36:20.378 --> 36:23.347
Okay, so you can go right around the corner here.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.413
CARROLL WENDY CANINE FEMALE SPAYED

38:26.637 --> 38:28.537
Okay, no address?

38:30.374 --> 38:31.841
And no phone either?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.968
No. I mean, no, not right now.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.781
I'm just passing through.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.575
Do you have a previous address?

38:44.088 --> 38:46.955
My sister and her husband. They live at...

38:47.058 --> 38:51.119
...East, 73 East Jackson...

38:51.962 --> 38:56.092
...Muncie, Indiana, 47603. You can use that.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.795
Okay.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.964
Do you think that you'll find her soon?

39:01.072 --> 39:02.061
Well...

39:05.576 --> 39:07.441
...you're just gonna have to keep checking in, okay?

39:07.578 --> 39:09.569
It's gonna be up to you now.

39:10.448 --> 39:11.540
Okay.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.814
Thank you.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.502
I don't think so.

40:13.477 --> 40:16.571
Okay, just set the Voltmeter
to the DC scale, all right?

40:17.882 --> 40:20.476
Measure the voltage across the battery terminals.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.884
The volt meter reads less than 14 volts...

40:25.055 --> 40:27.489
...you know, it should read 14.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.052
Okay?

40:29.693 --> 40:33.060
If it reads less than 12 you might have a problem.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.089
Okay, tell you what...

40:37.768 --> 40:39.759
...you turn on the heater...

40:39.937 --> 40:42.201
...you turn on the defogger...

40:42.506 --> 40:45.100
...you turn on the radio, and you rev up the motor...

40:45.242 --> 40:47.574
...you're turning on everything that draws power...

40:47.711 --> 40:50.441
...and then you turn on the
motor, you rev up the motor...

40:51.115 --> 40:55.779
...and if the Voltmeter reads lower than 14 volts...

40:55.953 --> 41:00.686
...your alternator's probably no
good. Okay? Well, good luck.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.552
What's up?

41:04.662 --> 41:06.789
Start talking, I'm listening.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.660
I think I've got a problem with my S-belt.

41:10.034 --> 41:11.023
What?

41:11.535 --> 41:15.733
With my S-belt. I think my
Serpentine belt is cracked.

41:15.906 --> 41:18.170
Oh, yeah. Serpentine belt?

41:19.910 --> 41:23.141
A guy in Salt Lake City said that
he thought it was cracked...

41:23.280 --> 41:26.807
...and that it would run about
150 dollars for a new one.

41:27.618 --> 41:31.247
You were driving with the air
conditioning on? The engine jerked?

41:31.555 --> 41:33.216
Steam came out? That kind of thing?

41:33.858 --> 41:37.692
No. It just won't start. It just
makes this terrible sound.

41:41.198 --> 41:42.187
Yeah?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.501
Oh, man.

41:45.636 --> 41:48.605
You are blowing my mind.

41:49.607 --> 41:51.837
You are messing up my mind.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.575
Okay, I'll tell you what.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.612
Yeah, yeah.

41:57.214 --> 41:59.774
50 on Trade Show.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.985
No, that's it.

42:03.621 --> 42:07.648
Yeah, yeah, I said, you know, you're
really messing with my mind, man.

42:08.058 --> 42:09.650
Yeah, okay.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.255
Yeah. I'll see you later.

42:17.301 --> 42:19.326
What kind of car are we talking about?

42:20.304 --> 42:21.862
Well, it's an Accord.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.769
1988. It's right over there.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.601
Well....

42:27.344 --> 42:28.868
Easy enough to replace the Serpentine belt.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.638
I don't know why the ignition won't fire, though.

42:30.781 --> 42:32.806
Who knows. Could be the timing belt.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.277
How much is a new Serpentine belt?

42:38.689 --> 42:39.883
A hundred bucks.

42:40.224 --> 42:44.320
125. Depends if we have to order a
new one. I'll have to check stock.

42:45.663 --> 42:48.063
And it'll be 50 for labor.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.895
That's the best you'll find. I promise that.

42:52.036 --> 42:55.563
Okay. And what about a timing
belt? How much is that?

42:55.839 --> 42:59.775
Could be a little bit more, but I
won't know until I have a look.

43:00.377 --> 43:01.935
Okay.

43:02.146 --> 43:06.742
And we're going to have to tow it
over, I guess. That adds another 50.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.948
But it's just right there.

43:11.288 --> 43:15.315
Well, it's always 50. But there's
no mileage here. So it's just 50.

43:21.699 --> 43:24.099
30 bucks. I'll give you a deal. .

43:26.670 --> 43:27.659
Yeah.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.472
How's the dog?

45:18.282 --> 45:19.840
No news.

45:20.484 --> 45:22.213
No luck at the pound?

45:23.921 --> 45:25.388
Not yet.

45:29.226 --> 45:32.491
I had a Collie once that was gone for
two weeks before he came home.

45:33.097 --> 45:36.294
They'll find her. They always get their dog.

45:37.301 --> 45:39.963
Yeah, I sure hope so.

45:41.405 --> 45:46.240
Could I trade you for a quarter? I need
to use that pay phone over there.

45:46.343 --> 45:49.540
All I've got is change and it only takes quarters.

45:49.980 --> 45:51.538
Lots of minutes. Feel free.

45:51.849 --> 45:52.838
No, no.

45:52.983 --> 45:55.247
No one uses a pay phone anymore. Come on.

46:00.557 --> 46:01.990
Thanks.

46:18.976 --> 46:23.811
Hi, my name is Wendy Carroll.
I lost my dog Lucy and I....

46:26.116 --> 46:27.981
Yeah, yeah, hi.

46:28.986 --> 46:32.444
I was just calling to check and see
if there was any new information.

46:37.594 --> 46:42.361
Okay, all right, I understand. I'll keep
checking. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.353
How late are you here tonight?

47:04.488 --> 47:06.479
Eight o'clock. Eight to eight.

47:06.623 --> 47:07.487
Okay.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.824
Better than my last job. I'll tell you that.

47:11.528 --> 47:14.053
That was all night, every night.

47:16.533 --> 47:18.831
Not a lot of jobs around here, huh?.

47:19.336 --> 47:20.530
I'll say.

47:21.104 --> 47:23.038
I don't know what the people do all day.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.610
Use to be a mill. But that's
been closed a long time now.

47:28.445 --> 47:29.605
Don't know what they do.

47:35.052 --> 47:37.885
You can't get a job without an address anyway...

47:38.388 --> 47:40.049
...or a phone.

47:40.290 --> 47:44.420
You can't get an address without an
address. You can't get a job without a job.

47:44.928 --> 47:46.327
It's all fixed.

47:46.496 --> 47:48.657
That's why I'm going to Alaska.

47:51.368 --> 47:53.199
I hear they need people.

47:54.338 --> 47:56.101
I hear it's really pretty up there.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.332
Yeah.

48:00.210 --> 48:02.542
You know, if you need a contact
for the pound or anything...

48:02.679 --> 48:05.239
...I'm just standing here with my
hands in my pockets all day.

48:08.118 --> 48:10.586
You can use my phone
number if you like, you know.

48:12.956 --> 48:14.218
Yeah.

48:17.527 --> 48:19.995
I might do that. That'd be good.

48:42.719 --> 48:46.917
floppy ears, sharp eyes,
yellowish-brown, friendly face

49:09.579 --> 49:11.308
I'm LOST!!!

49:17.487 --> 49:20.012
You lost your dog?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.322
Wow, bummer.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.457
Wow, where did you lose it?

49:25.062 --> 49:27.587
You don't know? Well, I guess if you
knew, you'd know where to find it.

49:27.731 --> 49:29.028
Yeah, I guess so.

49:29.132 --> 49:32.192
Well, that's too bad. If I see it,
I'll give you a call. Good luck.

49:32.336 --> 49:34.065
Thanks. Appreciate that.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.089
Lucy!

50:43.673 --> 50:44.765
Anything?

50:45.308 --> 50:46.639
Afraid not.

50:48.111 --> 50:51.137
They came and rolled your
car away about an hour ago.

50:54.384 --> 50:58.218
You know, I was remembering today,
when I was a boy I'd go hunting...

50:58.655 --> 51:00.555
...and sometimes we'd lose the hound...

51:00.690 --> 51:03.488
...so my daddy would take his
coat and leave it in the woods...

51:03.627 --> 51:06.391
...the last place that he saw the dog.

51:06.563 --> 51:10.226
And after supper he'd come
back to fetch the coat...

51:11.668 --> 51:14.660
...and more often than not he'd
come back with the dog as well.

51:16.773 --> 51:18.502
Could I use that phone again?

51:18.642 --> 51:19.836
Sure.

51:21.778 --> 51:23.268
Thank you.

51:32.656 --> 51:36.820
Hello, I'm calling to check on a dog
that I reported missing. Lucy.

51:39.463 --> 51:42.899
Yeah, sorry, I've just been away from my
phone and so I thought I would check.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.527
Okay.

51:45.869 --> 51:47.461
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

51:55.846 --> 51:57.438
Wait.

51:58.815 --> 52:01.716
Did you say that the dog would,
the dog came back to a coat?

52:02.252 --> 52:03.446
Yes, indeed.

52:03.620 --> 52:06.111
That's how I remember it.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.590
Lucy!

52:45.795 --> 52:46.921
Lu!

53:12.222 --> 53:13.314
Lu?

54:25.328 --> 54:27.296
Please, please, please.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.674
Man.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.715
Don't look at me.

56:39.963 --> 56:41.828
This is a steep hill, huh?

56:43.133 --> 56:44.657
Ain't it?

56:45.502 --> 56:49.438
Those kids coming down on a cardboard...

56:50.006 --> 56:51.667
...they're having some fun.

56:54.878 --> 56:59.508
Of course if that cardboard wasn't so worn
and old, you know, they'd slide better, right?

57:16.633 --> 57:19.033
I don't like this place.

57:22.672 --> 57:24.606
You know, it's the fucking people.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.200
The fucking people that bother me.

57:28.778 --> 57:30.177
God, they have attitude.

57:34.884 --> 57:35.942
I mean...

57:40.457 --> 57:42.049
...I'm out here...

57:43.526 --> 57:45.551
...just trying to be a good boy...

57:46.930 --> 57:49.922
...and it's just like they don't want to let me...

57:51.468 --> 57:52.730
...you know?

57:54.037 --> 57:58.974
I mean, they treat me like
trash, like I ain't got no rights.

58:03.213 --> 58:04.680
I mean...

58:05.748 --> 58:08.911
...they can smell the weakness on you.

58:10.787 --> 58:13.847
Move it along, move it along. Fuck you.

58:14.123 --> 58:16.182
You know? Fuck you!

58:18.094 --> 58:23.031
I mean, they gotta know I've killed
over 700 people with my bare hands.

58:33.643 --> 58:35.270
We lost, man.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.141
Fuck if I know.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.683
Hang on, girl.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.727
I'm coming.

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.179
You look a little stricken.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:03.911
I've been here since eight. Where have you been?

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:07.181
I had to take Holly's son to school.

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.223
It's my day off today too.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:13.020
You got a call after you left
here last night. The pound.

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.285
Really?

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.220
Yes, indeed.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:31.070
Hi, this is Wendy Carroll calling.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.239
I got a message from you all
last night about my dog Lucy.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.122
Are you positive?

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:52.526
Okay, where is she exactly?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.265
Where the 30 meets Leaf--

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.975
Where the 30 meets Leaf Erickson.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:09.284
Okay, well, I'll be there right
away. Thank you very much.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:10.985
Yep. Bye-bye.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.513
All right? Good news?

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:18.055
Yeah. That's good news, that's good news.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.423
Great.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.359
Someone took her home.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:25.896
Someone took her home the day she came in and
that's why they had such a hard time finding her.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.296
She's in a foster home.

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:32.271
Great. I told you they would find
her. Let that go on the record.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:34.069
It's on the record.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.145
So, that's it, huh? You're gonna be pulling out?

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.474
Uh-huh, that's the plan.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.148
Well, I hope it all works out.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.580
I know it will.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:51.153
I want you to take this. Don't argue.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.156
Just don't argue.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.024
Don't let Holly see. Just....

01:03:57.433 --> 01:04:01.893
If you ever come by here again,
you just stop by and say hi, huh?

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:05.430
Thank you. I will.

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.033
Okay.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.406
Bye-bye.

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.928
Ferry Running Times

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:01.960
Finally.

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.975
-Good morning. -Morning.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.512
You're up early.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.679
You want some coffee? I think the first pot's ready.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:34.563
Yeah, Indiana plates. You're a
long way from home, aren't you?

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.566
Got a long way to go, too.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.704
Well, the guy was right about the serpentine belt.

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:48.033
It's cracked all over the place. Just a matter
of time before the car gave out on you.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.007
Yeah, that's what he said.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.706
He wasn't all wrong, but he wasn't all right either.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:56.582
The serpentine belt is worn out, but
that's not why the car won't start.

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:57.686
No?

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:59.951
You've got milky oil.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.118
I didn't ask you to check the oil.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:09.721
I'm just telling you. Look,
you snapped a piston rod.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.693
Actually, you blew the head gasket first...

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.697
...water got into the cylinder
probably when you cooled it down.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.564
The rod can't compress the fluid then.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:21.143
And there you go, you ended up
with what the call "Hydro lock".

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:27.310
And if you want the car to drive again,
you'd have to rebuild the whole engine.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:32.282
Honestly, I don't think it's what you want to do. It
would end up costing more than the car is worth.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.354
Yeah?

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.095
No, I couldn't get around to it yesterday.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.455
Can you call me back later?

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.358
Righto. Bye.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:49.994
Are you sure?

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.630
Yeah. No question.

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.683
How much?

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.481
To fix it?

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:06.651
Two thousand.

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:09.782
At least two thousand.

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:13.662
Like I said, more than the car's worth. On
the other hand, it's less than a new car.

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:27.241
Look, I know this is bad news. It's
not what anyone ever wants to hear.

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:31.809
But see, the thing is, the car's taking up space
out there and I need to know what to do with it.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:37.413
I'll tell you what, just make it 30
bucks for the tow, for the...

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.386
... to junk it, and we'll take care
of everything and that'll be it.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:44.253
It's just that I can't just leave the
car sitting out there, it's gotta go.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.723
Okay. This is good here.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.161
Thank you.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:25.847
Hey, Lu.

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:31.021
Hey, Lu! Did you miss me? Huh?

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:33.256
You miss me? Huh?

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.924
You miss me? Huh? Come here,
Luce. Come here. Did you miss me?

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.496
I'm sorry. Come here.

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.534
I know, I know.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.546
Come on, Lu, don't be mad.

01:10:58.887 --> 01:10:59.876
Here.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.285
I got you something.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.894
Look at that.

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.330
Go get it.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.324
Good girl!

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:15.735
You're such a good catcher, huh? Drop it.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.862
Yes, such a good dog.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.309
Go get it, Lu. Go get that stick.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.475
Good dog.

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.341
You are the best catcher.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.612
Drop it, Lu.

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:33.481
Lu. Lu, give me that stick.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.489
Give me that stick, Lu. Give me that stick.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.991
Drop it. Good dog!

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.362
Good girl.

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.900
It's so nice here, Lu.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.379
That man seems nice.

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.925
Yeah, you got a nice yard.

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.031
I'm sorry, Lu.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.777
I lost the car.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.095
You be good.

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:57.970
I'll come back.

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.569
I'm gonna make some money and I'll come back.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.982
Okay, Lu?

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.416
Be good.
