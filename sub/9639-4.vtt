WEBVTT

00:05.400 --> 00:08.230
Justin, way to score
on the world history exam.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.430
Oh, thanks, Brian.

00:09.570 --> 00:13.300
You know, this might sound kind of lame,
but l didn't think you knew my name.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.740
Oh, l didn't.

00:14.870 --> 00:17.170
You left your sweater in class.
lt has your name in it.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.110
Look, l didn't do so good on this test.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.880
l just got one right: my name.

00:26.850 --> 00:29.690
Look, l was wondering if you could
help me out. You know, tutor me.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.790
l don't know, l'm kind of busy.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.950
l'll give you tickets
to the Tears of Blood concert.

00:34.090 --> 00:37.960
T.O.B.? Their new tour is awesome.
You got a deal.

00:38.460 --> 00:41.520
- Come by the Sub Station after school.
- Awesome.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.570
Oh, if any of my friends ask you,

00:43.700 --> 00:46.760
l was all over you
for talking to my girlfriend.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.540
And if any of my friends ask you,
your girlfriend actually talked to me.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.210
Oh, my gosh, did you hear?

00:54.350 --> 00:56.710
The 'Gurt Barn's handing out
free frozen yogurt samples.

00:56.850 --> 01:01.220
- Oh, how do you know that?
- On my cell. l got a 'Gurt alert.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.489
Well, you're gonna have to try it
without me. l have to work.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.020
You always have to work.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.150
A beanie?

01:09.300 --> 01:10.760
what's that? A hat?

01:10.900 --> 01:12.230
Crazy, funky, junky hat

01:12.370 --> 01:15.230
Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?

01:15.370 --> 01:18.100
we've been there, we've done that
we see right through your funky hat

01:18.240 --> 01:19.670
You were saying?

01:20.440 --> 01:22.930
lt's just really hard to have a friend
who's always busy.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.200
l know. Why don't l get my parents
to give you a job at the sandwich shop?

01:26.350 --> 01:28.610
We can hang out all the time
and even get paid for it.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.480
Really? That'd be great.
l've never had a job before.

01:31.620 --> 01:34.640
Well, except for the dollar Grandma
gives me for rubbing lotion on her feet.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.090
Yeah, well, we'll just make sure
that you're wearing gloves

01:38.220 --> 01:40.090
when you make the sandwich.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.650 --> 02:37.380
Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Russo.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.380
l happened to be passing by
when l noticed this ''help wanted'' sign.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.920
l'd like to apply for the position.

02:42.390 --> 02:46.920
Oh, wow, l didn't know we were hiring.
What a good idea, Mom and Dad.

02:47.590 --> 02:49.650
Harper, we didn't put that sign
in the window.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.730
Well, someone must have.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.590
We're not hiring
any sandwich associates.

02:53.730 --> 02:55.430
Or people wearing a sandwich.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.000
Harper, there's no job available.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.970
But if you can turn that sandwich
into a taco,

03:02.110 --> 03:04.800
l think Raul's is hiring down the street.

03:05.140 --> 03:09.010
But we're swamped.
We totally need more help with...

03:09.880 --> 03:12.110
All of our phone orders.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.020
Girls, l know you think it'd be fun
to work together,

03:15.150 --> 03:18.590
but it's really hard to work
with friends, or family.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.520
The one time you forget to wipe off
the tip of the mustard squeeze bottle

03:22.660 --> 03:27.030
and it's suddenly three hours
of silent salami slicing.

03:27.770 --> 03:31.260
lt dries at the end and gets crusty.
lt's unsightly.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.630
But, Mom, Dad, think about it.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.470
lf Harper works here, you could
spend more time with each other.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.270
Yeah, Jerry, we could even go
to one of those dollar movies

03:38.410 --> 03:40.440
you're always talking about.

03:40.580 --> 03:44.480
lt's a movie for a dollar.
How could you not talk about that?

03:46.050 --> 03:47.140
Let me show you.

03:47.290 --> 03:50.520
Alex, it is a big responsibility
training a new employee.

03:50.660 --> 03:51.950
Does that mean yes?

03:52.090 --> 03:54.650
You can't shirk your responsibilities
while you're training her.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.490
- Does that mean yes?
- And remember,

03:56.630 --> 03:58.220
business comes before friendship.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.860
l'm taking this all as a yes.
Harper, you're hired.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.530
l mean,
welcome to our family's business.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.700
- This would look great on you.
- No, it'd look better on you.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.900
- You're more of a summer.
- Speaking of Summer,

04:15.050 --> 04:16.980
did you hear what happened to her
in gym today?

04:17.120 --> 04:19.610
Speaking of Jim, l heard
he and Summer are going out now.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.740
That's what l was gonna say.

04:21.890 --> 04:26.520
Regis, Kelly, can l interrupt the talk show
to interest you in some actual work?

04:26.990 --> 04:28.360
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.

04:28.490 --> 04:31.160
We were just taking a little break,
but we're getting back to work.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.390
Okay. Well, there's a customer.
Why don't you go take his order?

04:34.530 --> 04:35.690
A cowboy hat?

04:35.830 --> 04:37.460
what's that? A hat?

04:37.600 --> 04:38.760
Crazy, funky, junky hat

04:38.900 --> 04:41.770
Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?

04:41.910 --> 04:44.740
we've been there, we've done that
we see right through your funky hat

04:46.410 --> 04:49.380
Wow, l was one away from all boys.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.910
Hi, welcome to Waverly Sub Station.
l'm Alex, l'll be your server today.

04:53.050 --> 04:54.680
And this is Harper,
she's our new trainee.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.480
Well, l'm thrilled.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.790
Tell you what, just give me
the Bronx-strami, a large root beer

05:02.930 --> 05:06.090
and a slice of that coffee cake
over there, huh?

05:06.230 --> 05:07.630
Really? Here's what l'd do.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.390
l'd get the half order.
lt's just as filling and half the price--

05:10.540 --> 05:12.970
- Harper.
- What? That's what l do.

05:13.110 --> 05:15.600
Oh, and get the small soda,
because it's free refills.

05:15.740 --> 05:18.640
Harper, when l said, ''Harper,''
l meant stop talking.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.340
Yeah, l'll have what the trainee said.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.270
How'd l do?

05:23.420 --> 05:27.480
Well, you just turned a $12 order
into us owing him.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.220
Table 4, sandwich up.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.720
Look, why don't you just run sandwiches
while l take the orders?

05:39.470 --> 05:40.660
l'm sorry.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.100
Look, why don't you just clean tables
and l'll take orders

05:43.240 --> 05:45.100
and run the sandwiches?

05:45.570 --> 05:47.200
So how's Harper working out?

05:47.340 --> 05:49.270
Great.
She's really getting the hang of it.

05:49.410 --> 05:51.880
How much coffee do l pour
on the coffee cake?

05:56.350 --> 05:58.340
That's just a joke between me and her.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.590
None, Harper, none.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.830
Alex, can l talk to you in the kitchen?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.030
Are you sure you don't wanna
change your shirt first? lt's gross.

06:54.170 --> 06:57.010
No. Because l'm sure
she's gonna do it again.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.380
Look, before you talk about
whatever you wanna talk about,

07:02.510 --> 07:05.350
l have something to say.
Harper's not working out.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.950
Oh, good.
Then we're on the same page.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.360
l'm not sure where this is going,
but continue.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.790
Right. l think we should let Harper go.

07:14.930 --> 07:17.920
Okay. This is a lot easier
than l thought it was gonna be.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.960
- Yeah, let me know how she takes it.
- Okay.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.700
Now we're not on the same page.
lt was your idea to hire Harper.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.670
And we told you,
business before friendship.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.140
So you're gonna have to fire her.

07:28.510 --> 07:31.170
Well, now l have a problem with that.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.140
You two come with me. Go.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.540
What are we doing in here?

07:36.680 --> 07:39.810
Okay, if we stay in here long enough,
Harper won't be able to find anyone

07:39.950 --> 07:41.780
and she'll just leave.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.880
And you expect that to work?

07:44.020 --> 07:46.350
Well, it's how l got out
of Harper's sewing club.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.220
Look, if Harper's not better
by the end of the day,

07:49.360 --> 07:50.990
you're going to have to fire her.

07:51.130 --> 07:53.890
And l don't know how you're gonna do it,
but l agree with your mother.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.730
Fine, but this could have worked.

08:01.870 --> 08:04.930
Waitress spell, waitress spell.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.310
No waitress spell.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.710
''Serving wrench.''

08:09.080 --> 08:11.450
Oh, serving wench.

08:11.580 --> 08:13.110
Hey, what's a serving wench?

08:13.250 --> 08:15.910
Serving wench. A young woman
usually related to an innkeeper,

08:16.050 --> 08:19.150
who, during medieval time, would
serve grog and food to guests of the inn.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.090
So like a waitress, right?

08:21.230 --> 08:23.520
Well, not technically, because--

08:23.660 --> 08:25.150
But like a waitress, right?

08:26.230 --> 08:27.290
l guess. Why?

08:27.430 --> 08:30.460
Did Dad say there was a pop quiz
on the medieval food-service industry?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.659
Yep. Better study up.

08:33.140 --> 08:36.039
- l had a diet.
- Are you sure that's not a diet?

08:44.520 --> 08:47.820
You're right. That's not the diet.
This is the diet.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.220
There. All better?

08:49.790 --> 08:53.590
Take this girl with the skills of a bench
And turn her into a serving wench

08:55.760 --> 08:58.990
You know, you need all new drinks.
l'll get those right away.

08:59.130 --> 09:02.460
- So how are you doing?
- Suddenly, a lot better.

09:14.810 --> 09:17.610
Boy, Harper improved quickly.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.650
Yeah, well, sometimes it just takes a while
for your skills to kick in.

09:20.790 --> 09:24.020
You probably know that from coaching
since you're such a good coach.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.150
l am a pretty good coach.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.620
Okay, Greg,
it's great that you heart Cindy,

09:35.770 --> 09:38.400
but that's not gonna help you
in algebra class.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.340
Anthony,
you're gonna have to start all over.

09:42.470 --> 09:45.570
Just saying that the Empire State Building
is tall and pointy is not an essay.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.470
lt's barely a sentence.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.980
And, Natalie.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.480
This is H3O.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.380
Now it's H2O, and l have a treat.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.020
Oh, what can l help you with,
young man?

10:00.160 --> 10:03.180
First of all, it's what l can help you with.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.030
This is a great tutoring business
you got here.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.400
lt'd be a shame
to see something happen to it.

10:12.270 --> 10:13.600
What?

10:14.610 --> 10:16.840
Looks like your world's
come tumbling down.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.240
You owe me a new globe.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.570
No, you owe me 25 percent
of your tutoring action.

10:22.350 --> 10:25.780
l'm the tutor in this neighborhood,
and l don't like competition.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.820
l bet you also
don't like amusement parks,

10:27.950 --> 10:30.110
because you're not tall enough
to ride the rides.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.310
Witty comeback.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.790
You know what l think
of witty comebacks?

10:36.700 --> 10:39.430
Pick up those sticks. Get it? lt's a game.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.050
Look it up.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.730
Good day.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.870
You get them.
You're closer to the ground.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.210
Because he's...

11:00.720 --> 11:02.210
Tuna wrap Brooklyn style, burn them.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.380
l need a roast beef.
Knock the wind out of it and let it walk.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.520
Where did all these people come from?

11:08.660 --> 11:10.820
Oh, Harper gave everyone
that was here earlier a coupon

11:10.960 --> 11:13.450
to come for dinner and get a free soda
with every sandwich.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.560
- But we already give free soda at dinner.
- l know. She's brilliant.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.560
Harper is doing great.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.170
l know. You know what you should do?

11:21.310 --> 11:25.170
You should leave her in charge tomorrow
so that you and Dad could do something.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.610
For as long as we've lived in New York,
we've never been to the Statue of Liberty.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.870
l know.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.250
And it's the one pencil sharpener
missing from my monument collection.

11:33.390 --> 11:34.940
Let's go.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.480
Order's up.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.210
Oh, my gosh. Did you hear that?

11:59.340 --> 12:01.540
l just talked my mom and dad
into leaving you in charge.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.270
So when they leave, we can lock up
and we can do whatever we want.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.280
Except go to the Statue of Liberty.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.920
l don't think so.
We're gonna be pretty busy here.

12:09.050 --> 12:12.110
l just e-mailed out a breakfast special,
so you should be in about 5 a.m.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.020
- l'm not coming in at 5 a.m.
- Yeah, l think you are.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.460
l need two bow-wows painted red.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.760
And who do l have to kick in the can
to get some nachos?

12:21.070 --> 12:23.560
- l can come in whenever l want.
- No, you can't.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.800
You heard your parents.
They're leaving me in charge.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.000
Because l told them to.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.830
You're not my boss.
l checked with my boss.

12:28.970 --> 12:32.340
And since l'm the boss of me,
l'm giving myself the day off.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.670
l hate to do this,

12:33.810 --> 12:36.710
but if you don't come in tomorrow,
you're fired.

12:41.150 --> 12:43.280
You can't fire me.
lt's my family's restaurant.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.690
- You're fired.
- l'm in charge. You can't fire me.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.050
My family owns the restaurant.

12:48.190 --> 12:50.320
And since l'm in the family,
that makes me part-owner.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.730
Owners can fire employees.
Do the math.

12:52.860 --> 12:53.920
Well, fine.

12:54.070 --> 12:57.160
lf you fire me from the restaurant,
l'm firing you from being my friend.

12:58.170 --> 13:01.400
l'm removing this apron
from the restaurant

13:01.540 --> 13:04.700
and the metaphorical apron
of our friendship.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.140
There's no apron of our friendship.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.540
Not anymore there isn't.

13:17.190 --> 13:20.890
So did she quit or did you fire her?
Which is it?

13:21.030 --> 13:23.860
lt was complicated. l guess both.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.050
Well, make sure she quit.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.790
That way l don't have to pay her
for the rest of the week.

13:28.570 --> 13:31.260
- Jerry.
- Oh, l mean, l'm sorry.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.340
lt's hard to work with friends.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.040
So you think you and Harper
are gonna be okay?

13:40.180 --> 13:44.240
l don't know. l tried to fire her from the job,
but she fired me from being her friend.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.440
what's that? A hat?

13:48.590 --> 13:49.650
Crazy, funky, junky--

13:49.790 --> 13:52.420
Oh, forget it. lt's not the same.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.990
Oh, honey, you want me to do
that crazy hat dance with you?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.690
No, it'd be weird,

14:00.830 --> 14:03.860
and it's kind of me and Harper's thing,
and sometimes it's about you.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.340
And for our next experiment,

14:11.480 --> 14:13.740
Chris is gonna drop a water balloon
and a Ping-Pong ball

14:13.880 --> 14:15.710
from upstairs at the same time.

14:15.850 --> 14:18.320
Which one do you think
is gonna hit the ground first?

14:20.850 --> 14:23.250
Chris, you were supposed
to wait for me to say ''go.''

14:23.390 --> 14:24.750
That guy--

14:26.420 --> 14:27.720
Okay.

14:28.090 --> 14:30.250
Kind of deserved that one.

14:31.260 --> 14:32.790
Let's take a five and regroup.

14:37.670 --> 14:40.640
Looks like Galileo's all wet.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.970
Where's my cut?
The Answer Man's getting tired of waiting.

14:44.110 --> 14:47.240
You're tired? Sounds like
it's nap time for the Answer Man.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.940
Nap time. Good one.

14:52.050 --> 14:56.250
Maybe it's nap time for you.
Enforcers, assemble.

15:01.030 --> 15:05.550
So you got a lot of really tiny friends,
and anyone can drop down a rope and:

15:07.400 --> 15:10.390
These two guys have black belts
in tae kwon do.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.970
That guy brought a rope.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.800
Chris, let them all go!

15:18.710 --> 15:20.110
Retreat, retreat.

15:26.450 --> 15:27.980
Justin.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.750
lt's you.

15:30.890 --> 15:34.220
Hey, you haven't seen like four or five
tiny little ninjas running around, have you?

15:34.590 --> 15:36.890
No. Have you seen
really tall flowers that talk?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.730
Wait, l'm not sure
what game we're playing.

15:40.870 --> 15:43.390
There's this kid Frankie.
Him and his little thugs are after me.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.660
They're trying to muscle in
on my Brain Train action.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.570
Oh, this isn't as fun a game
as l thought.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.570
Hey, are you on your way
to see Harper?

15:51.710 --> 15:53.540
No, why?
Where have you seen Harper?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.580
When Frankie chased me,
l hid in the 'Gurt Barn.

15:55.710 --> 15:56.770
She works there now.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.780
She wouldn't let me hide in the bathroom
unless l bought something.

16:00.090 --> 16:03.020
- So she got a job at 'Gurt Barn.
- Yeah, and she's amazing.

16:03.150 --> 16:06.090
She had like ten waffle cones
and a couple of 'Gurt Shakes in one hand.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.520
l did that.
l put a spell on her to make her good.

16:08.660 --> 16:09.720
Wait a minute.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.690
You used the serving wench spell
on her.

16:11.830 --> 16:13.020
Wait another minute.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.470
There's no pop quiz
on the medieval food-service industry.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.470
l crammed for that.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.870
Are you done?
Because l gotta go apologize to Harper.

16:24.740 --> 16:26.800
Yes, l'm done. Yeah.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.450
Justin Russo.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.650
You, you thought you could hide,
but you can't.

16:46.830 --> 16:49.770
Enforcers, assemble.

16:53.740 --> 16:58.440
Any last words, Russo,
besides ''Mommy''?

16:59.880 --> 17:03.870
Yeah, l got something to say.
Underachievers, assemble.

17:08.690 --> 17:11.119
Guys, over here.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.359
l'd like you to meet my friends.

17:14.490 --> 17:15.550
This is Brian.

17:15.690 --> 17:19.290
He's currently failing geometry,
but being recruited by Canadian football.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.300
This is Doug, going into his third year
of 1 1th grade.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.800
All-state wrestler.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.770
And this guy? He's got a record.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.640
You're smart enough to see
where this is going, right, Answer Man?

17:34.050 --> 17:37.110
This is just a little back and forth.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.240
You know, something tutors do.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.010
What do you say, friends?

17:45.490 --> 17:47.320
l don't think so.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.720
Enforcers, run.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.230
Get them, they're getting away. Go.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.070
l know you've only been working here
four hours,

18:05.210 --> 18:08.370
but congratulations,
you're employee of the month.

18:10.080 --> 18:15.820
As soon as l get some photo paper,
go home, hook it up to my printer,

18:15.950 --> 18:19.650
print it, bring it back here,

18:20.790 --> 18:22.660
l'll pin it up.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.590
- Gee, thanks.
- lt's a real honor.

18:26.730 --> 18:32.640
l almost won it four times, but l didn't,
because l take too many breaks.

18:32.940 --> 18:36.810
That reminds me,
it's time for my break.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.540
Hi, welcome to the 'Gurt Barn.
How can l--?

18:43.680 --> 18:44.810
What do you want?

18:44.950 --> 18:47.380
For us to be friends again.
l'm not leaving here until we are.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.850
Well, l don't need your friendship,
because l'm employee of the month.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.390
And l have a new friend.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.550
- Who?
- My manager.

18:55.690 --> 18:56.990
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

18:57.130 --> 19:00.690
Well, l can't tell you.
She told me not to wear it out.

19:01.970 --> 19:03.300
Look, Harper, we're best friends.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.400
And because you got really bossy
at the restaurant

19:05.540 --> 19:07.330
doesn't mean l don't miss you
being my friend.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.840
l wasn't bossy.

19:08.970 --> 19:10.870
You weren't respecting me
as your boss.

19:11.010 --> 19:14.040
Because you're not my boss.
Why don't you just accept my apology?

19:14.480 --> 19:17.510
Because ''you got really bossy''
is not an apology.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.910
Now, just go away.
l have to refill the machine.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.160
- Can l hide in your bathroom?
- Not unless you buy something.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.260
l'll pay on the way out.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.360
- l thought he ran in here.
- Where is he?

19:34.500 --> 19:37.800
l don't know,
but l gotta go to the bathroom.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.410
Hey, Alex, how'd things go
with you and Harper?

19:41.540 --> 19:44.100
- Not good.
- What are you gonna do?

19:44.780 --> 19:46.140
l'm doing it.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.340
Take this girl who's a great serving wench
And give her back her skills of a bench

19:50.480 --> 19:54.180
Oh, l'm so sorry.
l don't usually do this sort of thing.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.720
l'm employee of the month.

19:55.850 --> 19:59.220
Well, this is still good.
We can scoop it up.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.760
Let me just get you
some all-new yogurt.

20:06.230 --> 20:09.100
So that was your solution?
Make her look bad in front of everybody?

20:09.630 --> 20:12.500
l don't know. l'm mad.
l just want her to be my friend.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.070
Well, if you want her to be your friend,
you gotta be a friend to her.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.770
l hate it when you're right.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.840
- But you kind of wanna thank me.
- No.

20:27.550 --> 20:28.640
Here, let me help you.

20:28.790 --> 20:31.280
- Why do you wanna help me?
- Because l'm your friend.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.980
You can fire me from being your friend,
but can't fire me from acting like a friend.

20:35.130 --> 20:37.250
Here, go get cups.
We need cups, cups.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.300
l just can't get this cow to turn off.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.330
Okay. No, no.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.130
We're gonna need something bigger.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.520
Okay,
we're gonna need something bigger.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.190
Brain freeze.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.700
- lt must have run out.
- Yeah.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.300
Nope. Now it did.

21:22.670 --> 21:23.940
l'm so sorry.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.640
Why are you sorry? lt's like a funky hat.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.610
what's that? A hat?

21:29.750 --> 21:30.940
Crazy, funky, junky hat

21:31.080 --> 21:33.920
Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?

21:34.050 --> 21:37.080
we've been there, we've done that
we see right through your funky hat

21:40.090 --> 21:44.080
l'm sorry. We had a bit of an accident.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.700
We should get our stories straight
before the owner comes in.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.730
- No, no.
- Hey, wait up.

21:54.310 --> 21:55.970
We'll blame him.

21:56.110 --> 21:59.040
Perfect.
l've been blaming him my whole life.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.110
we see right through your funky hat

22:04.250 --> 22:05.650
Mom, don't add your own moves.

22:05.780 --> 22:08.880
This isn't the '80s.
This isn't Footgrease music.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.920
lt's Footloose or Grease,
And those movies were great.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.550
Come on, take it from the top.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.820
what's that? A hat?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.790
Crazy, funky, junky hat

22:18.930 --> 22:22.560
Overslept? Hair unsightly?
Trying to look like Keira Knightley?

22:22.700 --> 22:27.430
And pull the cord,
pull the cord, pull the cord.
