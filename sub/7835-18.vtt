WEBVTT

00:00.046 --> 00:03.173
The Simpsons

00:06.427 --> 00:07.511
D'oh!

00:12.058 --> 00:13.100
My brain!

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:22.902 --> 00:26.697
Welcome to Career Day.
Here to tell to
you about his job

00:26.781 --> 00:30.409
is Bart's friend's dad,
Kirk Van Houten.

00:30.493 --> 00:32.786
How many of you children
have gone out to your car

00:32.870 --> 00:35.288
and found a flyer
on the windshield?

00:35.373 --> 00:37.374
Are you the guy
that puts them there?

00:37.458 --> 00:39.626
No. I'm his assistant.

00:39.711 --> 00:42.963
But one time he was sick
and he let me do it.

00:43.047 --> 00:45.132
I totally screwed it up.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.050
That's it.

00:47.468 --> 00:52.347
I see. Well, we still
have 56 minutes left.
Any questions?

00:54.559 --> 00:57.227
Do you know Mom's
getting re-married?

00:57.311 --> 00:59.271
What? But she...

01:00.314 --> 01:03.275
I think we
should probably talk
about that later, Son.

01:03.359 --> 01:05.485
No. You might as well
talk about it now.

01:05.945 --> 01:07.738
That was one
lousy Career Day.

01:07.822 --> 01:09.197
If we can't get
better speakers,

01:09.282 --> 01:10.574
we'll have to go
back to teaching.

01:10.658 --> 01:13.076
And I can't stare
at those lifeless
fisheyes anymore!

01:13.161 --> 01:15.954
As head of the
Student Activities Committee,
I have an idea.

01:16.038 --> 01:17.873
I was wondering what
she was doing here.

01:17.957 --> 01:21.001
The speakers are poor
because we're letting
just anybody do it.

01:21.669 --> 01:25.172
Groundskeeper Willie,
Groundskeeper Willie's
enemy, Seamus.

01:25.256 --> 01:29.217
Yes. Seamus.
Ninety minutes of watching
a man drink in a bathtub.

01:30.344 --> 01:33.805
Well, I think we should
try the Springfield
Speakers Bureau.

01:33.890 --> 01:34.973
Good idea.

01:35.808 --> 01:38.059
Seamus,
we won't need you
to speak anymore.

01:38.144 --> 01:41.271
What?
This is your doing, Willie!

01:41.355 --> 01:43.690
I'll turn your groin
to pudding!

01:44.066 --> 01:47.861
You speak like a poet,
but you punch like one,
too!

01:50.740 --> 01:52.032
You bastard!

01:54.368 --> 01:59.790
Wow. Walter Mondale,
Marvin Hamlisch,
Mark Fuhrman.

01:59.874 --> 02:03.502
The former president
of Procter & Gamble!

02:03.586 --> 02:07.088
We have a special this month.
Mr. Blackwell debates Mr. T.

02:08.257 --> 02:12.302
Oh, please.
I've seen nicer chains
on a set of snow tires.

02:12.386 --> 02:14.179
I pity the fool who
derives self-esteem

02:14.263 --> 02:15.972
from mocking other
people's clothes.

02:16.057 --> 02:17.390
I hate myself.

02:17.558 --> 02:21.144
Ooh! Here's a
wonderful speaker,
Geoff Jenkins!

02:21.229 --> 02:24.105
Who?
He created a cartoon
called Danger Dog.

02:24.190 --> 02:26.149
It's popular with
kids and adults.

02:26.234 --> 02:27.734
Yes. Fine. He'll do.

02:27.819 --> 02:30.403
Anything to end this
unstructured conversation.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.281
And in a gutless act
of political correctness,

02:33.366 --> 02:35.450
Pizza Day will
now be known as

02:35.535 --> 02:37.828
Italian-American
Sauce Bread Day.

02:37.912 --> 02:41.665
Now that's sensitivity.
Right, Giuseppe?

02:42.875 --> 02:45.085
Giuseppe is such
a happy monkey.

02:45.419 --> 02:46.878
And now,
today's guest speaker,

02:46.963 --> 02:49.464
the creator of Danger Dog,
Geoff Jenkins!

02:50.591 --> 02:52.425
Geoff! Geoff! Geoff!

02:52.510 --> 02:53.593
Thanks, kids.

02:53.678 --> 02:57.514
Next month we'll be
airing the Danger Dog
Easter Special.

02:57.598 --> 03:00.433
Would anyone like to
see a sneak preview?

03:00.518 --> 03:02.435
Yeah!

03:08.484 --> 03:10.694
Danger Dog,
Neuterville needs you!

03:10.778 --> 03:14.072
I hope this is important.
I've got a hot date tonight.

03:14.156 --> 03:16.491
With Sarah Jessica Barker.

03:16.576 --> 03:21.454
Nice.
Anyway, your archenemy,
Molly Ringworm,

03:21.539 --> 03:24.457
has threatened to destroy
the city with her puke ray.

03:29.297 --> 03:32.132
The mayor's barf is
worse than his bite.

03:33.426 --> 03:34.801
Le mot juste.

03:51.652 --> 03:55.113
If you freeze the frame,
you can see that
the chunks of barf

03:55.197 --> 03:58.909
are actually pictures
of our animators
and their friends.

04:00.369 --> 04:01.411
Are there any questions?

04:01.495 --> 04:02.704
Here! Right here! Hello!

04:02.788 --> 04:03.747
Yes, you.

04:03.831 --> 04:05.582
What state does
Danger Dog live in?

04:05.666 --> 04:07.584
Michigan. Next.

04:07.668 --> 04:10.462
Why does Danger Dog
mean more to me than
school or church?

04:10.546 --> 04:11.922
Because those things suck.

04:15.009 --> 04:17.385
I have
a question, Mr. Jenkins.

04:17.470 --> 04:20.596
Could you tell us
about all the hard work
and buckling down

04:20.680 --> 04:23.099
that you put
into every cartoon?

04:23.184 --> 04:26.102
Are you kidding?
This is the easiest job
in the world.

04:26.187 --> 04:29.230
I spend most of my time
eating candy and going
to R-rated movies.

04:29.357 --> 04:30.982
Wow. Cool.
Wow.

04:33.235 --> 04:36.780
Well, then,
tell the children how hard
you studied in school

04:36.864 --> 04:38.114
to get
where you are today.

04:38.199 --> 04:39.199
Studied?

04:39.283 --> 04:42.786
Kids, all I ever did was
sit in class and doodle.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.455
Like this one.
It's what your principal
would look like as a woman.

04:51.003 --> 04:53.296
Fire, children!
Hurry outside!

04:53.381 --> 04:55.256
There's no time to let
today's lecture sink in!

04:57.301 --> 04:58.343
Why'd you do that?

04:58.427 --> 05:01.554
I won't stand by
while you're
glamorizing sass.

05:02.056 --> 05:04.975
Now those youngsters
will throw their lives away,

05:05.059 --> 05:07.060
drawing things
that never were.

05:09.271 --> 05:11.648
I'm coming up with
my own cartoon character.

05:11.732 --> 05:13.984
He's called Danger Cat.

05:14.068 --> 05:16.361
Mine's called Trouble Dog.

05:16.779 --> 05:18.405
I'm called Ralph.

05:20.282 --> 05:22.867
Mine is Danger Dude.
But he's a dog.

05:26.414 --> 05:28.915
Oh, yeah.

05:29.125 --> 05:33.253
Well,
I'm my own toughest critic,
but I think it's genius.

05:33.337 --> 05:34.587
Now, to sell it
for millions.

05:35.464 --> 05:38.216
This comic strip is
lame and derivative.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.301
I'll be
the judge of that!

05:40.386 --> 05:43.013
Oh...
Stan Lee?

05:43.097 --> 05:45.181
Creator of Marvel Comics?

05:45.266 --> 05:47.100
Greetings, true believers.

05:50.312 --> 05:52.147
My heart is pounding
like Thor's hammer

05:52.231 --> 05:55.025
on Dr. Doom's
titanium-infused faceplate!

05:55.109 --> 05:59.362
Hey, aren't you
the guy who was
stalking Lynda Carter?

05:59.447 --> 06:00.905
The term is "courting. "

06:00.990 --> 06:03.033
The restraining order
says, "No, no. "

06:03.117 --> 06:05.076
But her eyes say,
"Yes, yes. "

06:05.161 --> 06:06.536
Let's see what
you've got, son.

06:08.748 --> 06:11.249
My Spidey sense
is tingling.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.375
It's that good?

06:12.460 --> 06:17.505
Did I say "Spidey"?
I meant stinky. 'Nuff said.

06:17.590 --> 06:18.798
What did I do wrong?

06:18.883 --> 06:21.176
I don't know.
Try everything.

06:21.260 --> 06:25.638
Now hold on, Comic Book Guy.
This boy's still
finding his voice.

06:25.973 --> 06:27.515
So, you're saying
I should keep trying?

06:27.600 --> 06:28.808
Absolutely.

06:28.893 --> 06:32.520
And if you fail,
you can always open
a comic book store.

06:32.605 --> 06:34.898
Stan Lee insulted me.

06:34.982 --> 06:38.401
But in Bizarro World,
that means he likes me.

06:39.570 --> 06:41.529
I just need
one great idea.

06:44.492 --> 06:47.327
Batman!
It's been done.

06:48.496 --> 06:50.497
Green Lantern. No.

06:51.165 --> 06:54.042
I like Little Dot.
Could you rip that off?

06:54.126 --> 06:55.460
I mean,
who's gonna know?

06:55.544 --> 06:57.045
I'd know, Mom!

06:57.797 --> 07:00.173
That little girl
sure loved dots.

07:01.634 --> 07:04.844
Hmm. All I need is
one classic character.

07:06.514 --> 07:07.847
Stupid lawn chair!

07:09.016 --> 07:11.101
Come on! Unfold, you...

07:12.728 --> 07:13.728
Ow!

07:14.688 --> 07:15.772
D'oh!

07:16.607 --> 07:17.774
Hey!

07:25.157 --> 07:27.158
This'll teach
that stupid chair!

07:27.243 --> 07:28.701
I'm on fire!

07:32.039 --> 07:34.207
I hope
no one's drawing this!

07:39.338 --> 07:42.298
Hey, always drawing
your old man, huh?

07:42.383 --> 07:45.176
You must think
I'm the greatest
dad in the world.

07:50.224 --> 07:53.726
Lousy minor setback!
This world sucks!

07:54.562 --> 07:58.064
Don't you hate carpet
stores that charge extra
for the under padding?

07:58.149 --> 08:00.567
I hate them so much!

08:03.904 --> 08:06.573
Tonight,
When Dinosaurs Get Drunk...

08:06.782 --> 08:07.782
Mmm!

08:14.331 --> 08:15.832
Oh, I've been there, man.

08:15.916 --> 08:17.834
...has been canceled.

08:17.918 --> 08:20.962
Instead we bring you
The Boring World
of Niels Bohr.

08:25.176 --> 08:29.554
My ice cream sandwich!
Then where the hell's
the remote?

08:29.638 --> 08:32.932
Why do people
keep moving it?
Stupid...

08:33.642 --> 08:35.184
This is perfect.

08:36.770 --> 08:40.481
A couple of stink lines
around his butt,
and I'm done.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.193
Angry Dad rocks!

08:47.072 --> 08:51.576
"Argh! I'm angry. "
That's like something
my dads would say.

08:51.952 --> 08:55.830
Simpson, you've created
a timeless comic character.

08:55.915 --> 08:56.873
Thanks, guys.

08:56.957 --> 08:58.374
Will you sign
Martin's cast?

08:58.459 --> 09:00.210
What cast? Ow!

09:00.628 --> 09:02.921
I won't be swimming
this summer.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.882
Bart, this is just Dad.

09:05.966 --> 09:09.552
It's a composite character.
Your dad, my dad,
a little of Maggie's dad.

09:09.637 --> 09:11.179
No. It's just Dad.

09:11.263 --> 09:14.557
Maybe Angry Dad
needs a sidekick,
Know-It-All Sister!

09:14.642 --> 09:17.518
Can she have a pony?
And the last line
in the scene?

09:23.609 --> 09:25.276
Your penciling
is sub-Ziggy

09:25.361 --> 09:28.196
and the main character
is off-model
in every frame.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.074
However,
I deem this rack-worthy.

09:31.659 --> 09:35.662
Wow, I made it!
My week-long dream
has come true!

09:36.789 --> 09:41.251
Hold it, son.
Wouldn't you rather have
an exciting action figure?

09:42.169 --> 09:45.046
But only Batman
fits in my Batmobile.

09:45.130 --> 09:48.258
Are you nuts?
The Thing fits in
there perfectly.

09:50.511 --> 09:52.804
Look.
He's fitting right now.

09:55.182 --> 09:56.766
Stan Lee came back?

09:56.892 --> 09:58.518
Stan Lee never left.

09:58.811 --> 10:00.019
And I'm starting to
think that his mind

10:00.104 --> 10:02.021
is no longer in
mint condition.

10:03.816 --> 10:05.441
You broke my Batmobile!

10:05.526 --> 10:08.444
Broke?
Or made it better?

10:18.706 --> 10:21.666
Now I can't stand
in line anymore.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.167
Bart Simpson,
creative genius?

10:23.252 --> 10:24.294
What's it to you?

10:24.378 --> 10:25.378
I'm from the Internet.

10:25.462 --> 10:28.047
We'd like to
turn Angry Dad into
an animated series.

10:28.132 --> 10:31.426
Wow! Angry Dad,
an Internet cartoon!

10:31.510 --> 10:34.595
I'll be in cyberspace next to
the Nabisco Cookie Web site!

10:34.680 --> 10:37.140
Hey, Soul Patch,
you cut the line!

10:37.349 --> 10:39.058
Here's my card.

10:42.855 --> 10:43.980
Whoa!

10:44.064 --> 10:46.149
This is people working?

10:50.029 --> 10:51.571
This is great.

10:51.905 --> 10:54.115
Hey, Bart. Care for
a children's cappuccino?

10:54.199 --> 10:57.327
What up, man?
This is my manager/sister,
Lisa.

10:57.411 --> 10:58.453
What up?

10:58.537 --> 11:00.079
Everyone here
loves Angry Dad.

11:00.164 --> 11:02.248
It's just what
we've been looking for.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.167
So, what do you
want to do with it?

11:04.251 --> 11:08.296
Bart, I'm not a woman
and I can't have babies.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.507
But I can
give life to animated
Internet cartoons.

11:11.592 --> 11:14.927
Let me show you one
of our hottest shows,
Bin Laden in a Blender.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.642
Well, it delivers
what it promises.

11:21.727 --> 11:25.021
Now, Bart,
we can't pay you a salary.
But we can give you stock.

11:25.105 --> 11:28.524
How is your
company gonna make money?
Do you have a business model?

11:29.193 --> 11:31.944
How many shares of
stock will it take to
end this conversation?

11:32.029 --> 11:33.863
Two million.
It is done.

11:33.947 --> 11:36.407
Now, let's watch
another of our
great cartoons,

11:36.492 --> 11:38.493
Lou Rawls, Secret Agent.

11:39.453 --> 11:45.041
You'll never find
that microfilm of mine

11:45.376 --> 11:48.711
Bart, meet the voice
of Angry Dad.

11:48.796 --> 11:50.546
Okay. Let's hear it.

11:50.631 --> 11:53.549
Well, I was thinking
of something like,

11:53.634 --> 11:55.385
"I'm a big fat idiot!"

11:55.469 --> 11:58.262
Wow! I think
we have our Angry Dad.

11:58.347 --> 12:00.348
Woo-hoo!
When do I get paid?

12:00.432 --> 12:02.308
In 2012.
D'oh!

12:03.811 --> 12:05.645
Now, we just add color.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.651
In five minutes, it'll be
on the World Wide Web.

12:11.735 --> 12:13.069
I can't wait that long.

12:13.153 --> 12:16.030
To pass the time,
help yourself to
some more stock.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.375
That's funny!

12:27.459 --> 12:30.461
There's only one way
my show can compete
with this.

12:30.546 --> 12:33.423
Book that animal
that always chomps
on my groin.

12:33.507 --> 12:34.799
Susan Anton?

12:34.883 --> 12:36.134
No, the lemur!

12:41.890 --> 12:45.518
Oh, what a day.
Maybe the headlines
will cheer me up.

12:47.604 --> 12:50.189
That's opinion, not news!

12:53.569 --> 12:55.194
That guy's hilarious.

12:55.279 --> 12:59.031
I especially like
his white shirt
and blue pants.

12:59.116 --> 13:01.993
Wait a second.
Angry Dad is me.

13:02.077 --> 13:05.246
Yeah.
Didn't you know? You've been
world-famous for an hour now.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.832
You're the Internet's
number one
non-porno site.

13:07.916 --> 13:09.709
Which makes you
ten-trillionth overall.

13:09.793 --> 13:12.795
What kind of a monster
would humiliate me like this?

13:14.423 --> 13:17.008
This has been
a Bart-toon presentation.

13:17.092 --> 13:19.177
In association with
Ay Carumba Entertainment.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.763
Why that little...

13:28.896 --> 13:30.563
Stupid Bart-toon.

13:32.065 --> 13:34.192
Bart-toon, that's clever.

13:34.276 --> 13:35.318
I'm gonna kill him.

13:37.404 --> 13:41.282
Look,
it's Internet buffoon,
Angry Dad.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.826
Let's send him into
one of his trademark fits.

13:43.911 --> 13:46.579
Hey, come on!
Make your eyes explode.

13:48.040 --> 13:52.502
Stop it!
The more you rock,
the angrier I get!

13:52.586 --> 13:54.045
You heard the freak.

13:56.256 --> 13:57.632
Leave me alone!

14:05.682 --> 14:07.391
Look at me.
I'm Angry Dad!

14:15.359 --> 14:19.445
This job sure is easy.
Now, to press this button.

14:22.115 --> 14:24.242
Not again!

14:25.118 --> 14:27.537
Angry Dad, you're fired.

14:30.332 --> 14:32.291
Die, monster!

14:33.961 --> 14:35.169
Homer, what are you doing?

14:37.172 --> 14:40.633
We're just rehearsing
The Motion Picture.

14:40.717 --> 14:43.052
How'd you like to be played
by John Goodman?

14:43.136 --> 14:48.474
That's so obvious.
It should be Gary Oldman.

14:49.142 --> 14:51.269
Dad, I'm no fan
of Bart's cartoon,

14:51.353 --> 14:53.396
but you have a real
problem with anger.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.357
I'm just passionate.
Like all us Greeks.

14:56.650 --> 15:00.403
No, you're angry.
Look, you're punching
the cat right now.

15:00.487 --> 15:03.573
I am...
Oh, my gosh,
you're right!

15:03.657 --> 15:05.533
I'm a rage-aholic.

15:07.828 --> 15:11.289
I just can't live
without rage-ahol!

15:13.959 --> 15:17.420
Congratulations, Dad.
The first step
is admitting it.

15:17.504 --> 15:18.963
Is it also the last step?

15:19.047 --> 15:20.840
No. The last step
is quitting.

15:25.304 --> 15:29.307
Very well.
I'm not gonna be Angry Dad
for one day longer!

15:29.641 --> 15:32.351
I'm giving up
anger forever!

15:32.436 --> 15:35.438
If you ask me,
you should give
up fatty foods.

15:35.522 --> 15:36.897
I said anger!

15:44.698 --> 15:46.157
Did it again.

15:49.536 --> 15:52.121
Where the hell is that
soothing music coming from?

15:53.874 --> 15:56.292
Homer, what's going on?

15:56.376 --> 15:58.377
I gave up anger forever.

15:58.462 --> 16:01.172
From now on,
I'm into candles,

16:01.256 --> 16:03.924
soft music,
and horse tranquilizers.

16:19.775 --> 16:22.193
Nothing can make
me mad out here.

16:23.403 --> 16:24.945
Paperboy!

16:26.573 --> 16:27.865
Milkman!

16:29.701 --> 16:31.077
Piano lady!

16:35.123 --> 16:37.333
Must suppress rage.

16:40.962 --> 16:41.962
Huh?

16:46.468 --> 16:50.763
Come on,
Angry Dad, get angry!
Don't make me do a clip show!

16:51.014 --> 16:53.265
Hello there,
Flan-diddily-danders.

16:53.350 --> 16:56.268
Hey, Homer.
I've been singing
your praises all day.

16:56.353 --> 16:58.854
Marge said we could
have choir practice
in your house tonight.

17:04.069 --> 17:05.152
Here's a preview.

17:05.237 --> 17:08.698
God said to Noah
build yourself an arky-arky

17:08.781 --> 17:12.159
Animals came on by
onesies and twosies-twosies

17:12.243 --> 17:15.621
Elephants and
kangaroosies-roosies

17:19.667 --> 17:21.042
This little trap
is gonna make

17:21.127 --> 17:23.378
my dad angrier
than he's ever been.

17:23.463 --> 17:24.588
In the meantime,
I got to tell

17:24.673 --> 17:26.214
those Internet guys
to hold tight.

17:26.299 --> 17:27.425
Can I come, too?

17:27.509 --> 17:29.510
Good idea.
You can speak
nerd to them.

17:29.594 --> 17:31.595
I'm not a nerd, Bart.

17:32.055 --> 17:33.139
Nerds are smart.

17:38.019 --> 17:40.187
Oh, my God!
What happened?

17:40.272 --> 17:43.357
They went belly up
like all the other
Internet companies.

17:43.525 --> 17:45.443
Looks like
the bubble burst.

17:45.527 --> 17:46.819
Bubbles can burst?

17:46.903 --> 17:50.114
Yeah, but it's a golden age
for the repo business.

17:50.198 --> 17:52.491
One that shall never end.

17:54.327 --> 17:56.120
Bart, it's over.

17:57.414 --> 17:58.456
Ow!

17:58.540 --> 18:00.249
What do you mean,
"It's over"?

18:00.333 --> 18:02.877
We're bankrupt.
The stock is at zero.

18:02.961 --> 18:04.754
But I have
52 million shares.

18:04.838 --> 18:07.965
What's 52 million times zero?
And don't tell me it's zero!

18:08.049 --> 18:11.093
Bart, it's not about
how much stock you have.

18:11.178 --> 18:12.303
It's about how
much copper wire

18:12.387 --> 18:13.679
you can get out of
the building with!

18:16.683 --> 18:19.560
Looks like you can't
retire by age 12.

18:19.644 --> 18:22.605
Yeah. But at least now
that my show's canceled,
I don't need material.

18:22.689 --> 18:25.858
So there's no need
to lure my dad into
the trap I set for him.

18:25.942 --> 18:27.401
The trap!

18:30.655 --> 18:34.533
They call me
mellow yellow, quite rightly

18:34.910 --> 18:38.704
This fellow never bellows,
quite rightly

18:39.498 --> 18:40.623
Mmm.

18:50.884 --> 18:52.635
This looks suspicious.

18:52.719 --> 18:53.886
But delicious!

19:02.354 --> 19:03.646
Cacti!

19:12.280 --> 19:14.281
Dirty diapers on strings!

19:23.667 --> 19:25.751
Time to put this
ordeal behind me.

19:35.887 --> 19:37.930
Homer mad!

19:41.643 --> 19:42.935
Thank God his
pants stayed on.

19:48.108 --> 19:53.779
Homer mad! Homer smash!
Get revenge on world!

19:54.114 --> 19:56.115
Look!
It's the Incredible Hulk!

20:02.664 --> 20:05.541
He can't be the Hulk!
I'm the Hulk!

20:09.963 --> 20:13.299
Please.
You couldn't even
change into Bill Bixby.

20:13.508 --> 20:15.926
Come on, damn it!
Change!

20:18.471 --> 20:19.847
Forget it.

20:21.808 --> 20:24.018
I really did it once.

20:24.102 --> 20:27.479
Yes, yes. I just wish
you had the power
to leave my store.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.567
You almost
had it there.

20:36.448 --> 20:39.575
Bart, your prank cost
$10 million in damages!

20:39.659 --> 20:41.285
I know. I'm sorry.

20:41.369 --> 20:43.787
Sorry for what?
Saving your father's life?

20:43.872 --> 20:44.914
What?
What?

20:44.998 --> 20:47.041
It's true.
You see, these boils

20:47.125 --> 20:49.501
on Homer's neck
are pent up rage.

20:49.586 --> 20:52.087
If Bart's trap
hadn't set Homer off,

20:52.172 --> 20:54.632
the anger would've
overwhelmed Homer's system.

20:54.716 --> 20:56.592
You mean I shouldn't
punish Bart at all?

20:56.676 --> 20:58.928
Why, if anything,
he should punish you.

20:59.012 --> 21:00.179
Huh?

21:00.263 --> 21:01.347
Okay.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.934
Well, Son,
I want to show you
how grateful I am.

21:05.018 --> 21:06.393
Let's go fishing.

21:08.063 --> 21:11.023
Who knew that anger
was saving my life?

21:11.191 --> 21:14.026
Say it, don't spray it.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.612
You're trying
to get me angry!

21:17.530 --> 21:18.572
Thank you.

21:18.657 --> 21:19.698
You're not welcome.

21:19.783 --> 21:20.783
D'oh!

21:20.867 --> 21:22.534
I love you, boy.

21:22.619 --> 21:24.620
Ha-ha! You love a boy!

21:25.705 --> 21:26.789
Stop it now!

21:27.958 --> 21:29.458
If you love me so much,
why don't you marry me?

21:29.542 --> 21:31.001
That's a good one.
