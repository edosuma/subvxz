00:34.743 --> 00:36.745
Morning, Lee.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.415
What's in the package?

00:39.498 --> 00:41.592
Curtain rods.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.266
Good morning. Hello?

01:25.294 --> 01:27.592
<i>And here is the President
of the United States.</i>

01:27.671 --> 01:31.221
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

01:31.300 --> 01:33.223
<i>We can...
And there's Jackie.</i>

01:33.302 --> 01:35.179
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:37.606
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

01:37.681 --> 01:40.525
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:42.695
<i>as the President and
the first lady pass by.</i>

01:42.769 --> 01:46.194
<i>There is Lyndon Johnson
and Lady Bird passing by.</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:18.514
Thank you, sir.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.523
<i>Thank you for seeing
me, Mr. Snyder.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:27.985
My name is Lee Oswald, and I've come
to renounce my American citizenship.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.442
Why would you do that?

02:29.608 --> 02:30.985
I'm a Marxist.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.160
You're a Marine, for God's sakes.
Marines don't defect.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.242
I've seen enough of
democratic society,

02:38.325 --> 02:39.872
of capitalistic society.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.875
My mother worked her whole life
making profits for capitalists.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.878
They push you down and they
never appreciate who you are.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.044
Have a seat.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.016
How old are you?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.140
Twenty. 20 years and 13 days.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.688
You're young, you're confused,
you're hurt, you're angry.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.187
This is not an emotional decision.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.939
I have studied Marx.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.698
You don't even know
what life is like here.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.150
In six months you're
gonna regret what...

03:08.230 --> 03:10.198
I've told the Soviets
that I know things.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.110
I had a very
high-security clearance.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.867
I was a radar technician for
the United States government.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.782
I am valuable.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.711
You'd be a traitor. I believe
that what I'm doing is right.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.505
And now the Soviets will see that
I'm serious. This will show them.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.084
Mr. Oswald, when something like
this is done, it can't be undone.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.919
No one ever listens to me.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.179
Nobody believes me.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.388
Now, I've made my decision,
and I'm through.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.647
Well, if you're serious, you take
a few days and you come back.

03:50.647 --> 03:56.404
A reporter, a young woman,
very attractive, asked me,

03:56.611 --> 03:59.615
"Senator Kennedy, how did you
get to become a war hero?"

03:59.698 --> 04:02.998
And I told her that it
was completely involuntary.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.249
They sunk my boat.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.330
They're ready for you, Jack.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.181
This was supposed to be Joe.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.273
He was the oldest.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.855
Father always thought
it would be Joe.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.034
And he was shot down,
and we were all,

04:37.194 --> 04:38.320
stunned.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.698
Cut into the way things
were supposed to go.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.004
Never supposed to be me,

04:47.078 --> 04:48.671
but it is.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.005
It was always supposed to be you.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.509
Are you ready?

05:12.604 --> 05:17.326
I am today announcing
my candidacy

05:17.400 --> 05:19.778
for the presidency
of the United States.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.491
<i>The very first returns are now
beginning to pour in substantially,</i>

05:23.573 --> 05:25.667
<i>and those in just a moment.</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:29.413
<i>So first of all, let us
go to our summary board.</i>

05:31.665 --> 05:34.293
Bobby's got Lyndon
on the phone for you.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.971
How's it going in there, Kenny?
It's close.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.598
We knew it would be.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.267
It's gonna come down to
Illinois, Texas and California.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.436
Well, we're gonna need Texas.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.109
How is he? Is he jolly?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.731
It's Lyndon.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.736
Hello, Lyndon.
<i>I see we're winning in Pennsylvania,</i>

05:56.815 --> 05:59.443
but what the hell
happened to you in Ohio?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.737
Well, how's it going
down there?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.035
Well, I'm happy to tell you,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.867
Texas is gonna be close,
but safe.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.668
Well, all right. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.087
Swear to God, Jack.
Swear to God.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.886
If that's all it takes
to make you president

06:16.960 --> 06:20.464
is to make that son of a bitch Lyndon
Johnson vice president, then so be it.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.675
It's the best deal
we ever made.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.219
<i>Gradually throughout the
night, he's widened that lead.</i>

06:26.303 --> 06:28.055
<i>He's about a half million
ahead right now.</i>

06:28.138 --> 06:32.018
<i>In Connecticut, Kennedy
took that state by 9:00.</i>

06:32.142 --> 06:34.986
<i>He rode up a very, very big...</i>
Jack, look at that!

06:36.605 --> 06:39.825
You've won Connecticut.
You're president now.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.114
No, no, no.
But look at the lead you've got!

06:42.193 --> 06:43.991
Well, yeah, sure,
in the Northeast,

06:44.070 --> 06:46.994
but we need to wait till the
Midwest and then the West.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.626
It's gonna be a long night.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.800
Well, tell me in the morning
who wins, Mr. President.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.097
Don't say that!

07:13.099 --> 07:14.897
So, my fellow Americans,

07:14.976 --> 07:19.447
<i>ask not what your country
can do for you.</i>

07:19.898 --> 07:22.697
<i>Ask what you can do
for your country.</i>

08:40.102 --> 08:41.946
Dance.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.825
Would you dance?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.664
Marina.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.000
Lee.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.598
No, I'm not Chinese.
I'm American.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.770
And my coworkers at the
radio factory call me Alik.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.939
Marina.
A beautiful Russian girl.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.920
I wanted to study in Moscow, but
they sent me to this horrible place.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.592
I like it better now.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.395
May I...

09:58.348 --> 10:00.396
May I kiss you?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.216
Mr. President.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.059
I'm sorry, but we got
a major problem in Cuba.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.518
<i>The invasion
of Cuba has created</i>

10:43.601 --> 10:46.980
<i>a highly delicate and difficult
situation for the United States.</i>

10:47.188 --> 10:49.316
<i>Cuba has said that
the invasion was mounted</i>

10:49.399 --> 10:51.527
<i>from Florida and
from Guatemala.</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:54.988
<i>The United States has denied
this, so has Guatemala.</i>

10:55.071 --> 10:57.665
<i>Castro knew the
battle plan beforehand,</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:02.086
<i>prepared an ambush and assigned himself
a prominent role in the battle.</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:06.625
Right now, the rebels are
pinned down here, on the beach.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.179
Castro himself is there.
Castro? On the beach?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.131
In a T-34 tank.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.435
I speak for the joint chiefs,
and I think CIA agrees as well,

11:17.510 --> 11:21.105
it is imperative that the United
States provide air support.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.392
Well, I don't want the United
States involved in this.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.021
We are involved in this.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.854
We trained these rebels.
You approved the mission.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.985
And you told me
the plan would work.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.113
You told me those men will be
met by anti-Castro forces.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.328
And where are they?
Are they there?

11:35.737 --> 11:40.789
Mr. President, are you aware there will
be significant casualties sustained?

11:41.743 --> 11:45.293
We need to act, and
we need to act now.

11:46.831 --> 11:50.552
<i>Beaches were not prepared
by air or artillery bombardment.</i>

11:50.627 --> 11:54.257
<i>Those able to move beyond the beaches
were trapped in swamp or high growth</i>

11:54.339 --> 11:55.465
<i>which was burned off,</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:59.394
<i>and the fire forced them out one by one
into the hands of Castro's forces,</i>

11:59.636 --> 12:03.812
<i>prisoners of war, dupes of
the United States government.</i>

12:07.977 --> 12:09.479
Jack?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.950
Jack, what is it?

12:19.447 --> 12:22.075
Jack, it's me.
You can talk to me.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.169
It's a catastrophe.

12:26.204 --> 12:30.175
The one hour of air support
that I ordered got screwed up.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.796
The two units didn't connect because
of a one-hour time difference.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.223
These incompetent son of a bitches,
they can't even tell time!

12:38.383 --> 12:41.057
I don't know why I ever
listened to them.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.888
You couldn't have known.
The President should know.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.853
How could I be so stupid?

12:46.891 --> 12:50.191
Jack, you're being too hard on yourself.
But they said it.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.361
They said I was
too young, too soft...

12:54.023 --> 12:55.616
About communism.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.865
And I told them I was ready.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.741
And they trusted me.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.324
They still do.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.544
There are men dying
on those beaches,

13:07.161 --> 13:08.413
right now.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.257
I'm supposed to be the most
powerful man in the world,

13:11.332 --> 13:13.050
and I...

13:16.212 --> 13:18.214
I'm impotent.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.722
Well, I'll tell you what.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.893
This is the last time anyone's gonna
make a decision like that for me.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.522
<i>And here on the
beaches around the Bay of Pigs,</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:33.230
<i>the invasion floundered and the
search for scapegoats began.</i>

13:33.396 --> 13:36.070
<i>The issue has been sharpened
further by disclosure</i>

13:36.149 --> 13:38.243
<i>of the President's
behind-the-scenes role.</i>

13:38.401 --> 13:43.157
The record will reflect that we at State
opposed the plan as a grave mistake.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.083
That's the most meaningless
bullshit I ever heard.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.836
You people are so anxious
to cover your own asses,

13:48.911 --> 13:51.255
all you want to do is dump
this on the President.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.175
Well, you bright fellows
got my brother into this.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.675
Only three months into office
and now, thanks to you,

13:57.754 --> 14:01.930
the President of the United States is
regarded as a paper tiger by the Russians.

14:04.594 --> 14:08.189
Well, there's an old saying

14:08.264 --> 14:11.063
that victory has
a thousand fathers,

14:11.142 --> 14:13.110
but defeat is an orphan.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.444
The responsibility's mine.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.535
I am the president.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.963
I didn't do nothing to you.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.147
Spy! American spy!

14:56.687 --> 14:57.779
Spy!

15:15.832 --> 15:17.880
You're back, like a bad penny.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.340
Told you you'd regret it.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.305
It's not what I thought
it would be.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.974
And it's so damn cold.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.975
I don't think I can take
another winter here.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.062
Can you guarantee me there'll be
no legal proceedings against me?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.394
I don't see why there would be.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.444
Ironically, because
you failed to return,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.272
you never officially
renounced your citizenship.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.948
Can I bring my wife Marina?

15:41.983 --> 15:45.613
Your wife's a Russian. She'll require an
exit visa from the Soviet authorities.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.823
I want to bring my wife
back to the United States.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.712
You're gonna love America, Mama.
I promise you.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.554
English no good,
have no clothes.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.646
You're gonna be fine.
And they'll love you there.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.348
And we'll be happier
there, I promise.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.650
Alik, you like little bird.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.692
Where you happy?

16:19.770 --> 16:23.695
A wife belongs with her husband,
and a baby with her father.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.653
Junka needs her papa.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.381
But, I would say that
being president is a fine job.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.548
It's a fine job.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.302
I get to walk to work
and the pay is nice.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.516
You look so beautiful.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.872
Would you tell Mrs. Baldridge
that we are on our way down?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.429
Yes, Mr. President.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.529
Mr. Oswald.
Please!

17:01.604 --> 17:03.527
Mr. Oswald, are you a communist?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.233
Yes, basically.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.160
Although I hate the USSR,
I do believe that Marxism

17:08.236 --> 17:10.364
can exist under
different circumstances.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.040
Why did you go to the
USSR, Mr. Oswald?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.742
I went as a mark of protest

17:14.825 --> 17:17.328
against American political
policies in foreign countries.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.541
I'm working.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.878
Go finish packing.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.929
Go mind the baby then. Go.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.394
Mr. Oswald, are you
a communist?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.020
No, of course not.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.274
Mr. Oswald, why have you chosen
to come back to America?

17:42.353 --> 17:44.606
I have lived under
both systems.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.448
I have sought the answers.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.824
Thank you, Mr. Oswald.
You are a true patriot.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.203
His name is Oswald?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.206
Lee Harvey Oswald.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.996
I have to wonder what he
was really doing in Russia

18:00.079 --> 18:02.127
and why the hell the State
Department let him come back.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.628
How'd he end up in Dallas?

18:03.708 --> 18:05.710
He's from here,
his mother's here.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.387
I interviewed her
two years ago after he left.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.057
"My poor misunderstood boy"
and all that.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.885
What'd he do, change his
name to Oswaldovitch?

18:16.220 --> 18:19.895
Mr. Oswald? I'm John Fain.
I'm an agent with the FBI.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.148
I was told there'd be no
charges brought against me.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.481
There are no charges. I'm
just asking a few questions.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.566
I expected questions
from reporters.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.576
There weren't any reporters.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.743
Why did you go to Russia
in the first place?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.164
Mr. Oswald?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.507
It's just something I did.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.510
Did you go to Russia
because you're a communist?

18:47.585 --> 18:50.714
I don't really want to talk about
the past. I mean, I'm here now.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.764
Are you now or have you ever
been a communist?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.092
I've never had a card.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.102
When you went to Russia,

18:57.178 --> 18:59.556
your mother told
the State Department

18:59.639 --> 19:02.142
you were some sort
of secret agent.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.778
Are you?

19:05.853 --> 19:06.900
A secret agent?

19:07.104 --> 19:09.357
Are you involved with
an intelligence agency?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.785
You're FBI.
Yes.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.455
And you don't know.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.425
Lee?

19:34.131 --> 19:37.761
Oh, my God. It's as hot
in here as it is outside.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.471
You live in this?

19:41.639 --> 19:44.643
Oh! This is horrible.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.156
How can you raise my granddaughter
in a horrible place like this?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.408
<i>Nyet, nyet.</i>

19:53.484 --> 19:55.031
Why don't you speak English yet?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.159
You moved here,
you should speak English.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.708
Mama, Mama,
what are you doing here?

19:59.740 --> 20:02.243
Oh, I brought groceries,
I brought diapers.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.327
How did you find us?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.412
Why is it so hot in here?

20:04.495 --> 20:06.668
I didn't want you coming here.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.045
Oh, you can't live here.
You're moving back in with me.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.969
No, Mama, I told you
we're not moving in with you.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.596
And what are you wearing? Married
women don't wear shorts that short.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.973
Ooh, she is a sour girl,
that one.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.862
I brought a bassinette.
It's in the trunk.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.933
Why don't you go out
and get it?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.142
No, Mama,
I don't want you here.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.853
I don't want you
meddling in our lives.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.938
Well, I can drive you around
to look for a job.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.273
I found a job!

20:32.356 --> 20:34.108
Oh, well, I can help
with the baby.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.488
I don't want your help.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.912
You understand? That's why we moved.
To get away from you.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.228
That's why I joined
the Marines.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.872
Now you stop that. You don't
talk to me like that.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.537
Where are you going?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.418
I'm going to check
on my wife and daughter,

20:48.497 --> 20:50.966
and when I come back,
I want you gone.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.010
Lee, you finally came
back home to me,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.713
don't let that woman
take you away from me again.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.264
You're it!

21:15.065 --> 21:16.442
Oh, Mrs. Kennedy.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.237
I'm sorry.
The pool is closed.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.367
Closed?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.619
Yes, closed, Mrs. Kennedy.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.504
Oh, no!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.545
I see.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.094
You have a woman problem.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.107
Judith Campbell?

21:50.142 --> 21:53.271
Edgar tells me in my capacity
as Attorney General

21:53.354 --> 21:55.982
and as much as my capacity
as your brother, I imagine,

21:56.065 --> 21:58.739
that you're having an affair
with Judith Campbell.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.996
Who is also having an affair
with Sam Giancana.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.032
Sam Giancana is a mobster.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.208
I'm aware of who Sam is.

22:07.201 --> 22:11.502
Jesus Christ, Jack. I'm investigating
Sam Giancana for racketeering!

22:13.916 --> 22:17.546
The press has been very good about
looking the other way when it comes to...

22:19.213 --> 22:20.715
But this is dangerous.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.520
All right.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.438
Is there anything else?

22:33.644 --> 22:35.442
No Judith Campbell.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.523
No Giancana.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.863
No mob.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.959
Mr. Oswald.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.711
I've already answered
all your questions.

22:54.790 --> 22:58.010
Would you mind talking with us again?
Just a few minutes.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.851
Well, my wife and
daughter are inside, so.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.303
We don't need to disturb them.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.180
We'll just talk here.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.027
We learned that you contacted the
Russian Embassy in Washington.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.741
You mind telling us why?

23:21.442 --> 23:23.240
My wife is a Russian citizen.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.359
She's supposed to let the
embassy know where she is.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.410
Is that all? What do
you mean, is that all?

23:27.489 --> 23:29.867
Did you talk to any Soviet
intelligence officers?

23:29.950 --> 23:31.452
About what?

23:32.119 --> 23:34.087
About American imperialism?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.757
About inequality for Negroes?
What?

23:36.832 --> 23:40.962
What I want to know, Lee, is are
they asking you to spy for them?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.932
Is that why they
let you come back?

23:45.132 --> 23:47.009
Is that why they
let you bring Marina

23:47.092 --> 23:49.094
and your daughter, June?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.440
Are you a Russian spy?

23:54.475 --> 23:57.024
Why would anyone
discuss spying with me?

23:58.145 --> 24:00.523
I mean, you're the big, bad FBI.
Shouldn't you know?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.233
Ain't you got
bigger fish to fry?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.364
Think of the state that our
country is in at the moment.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.196
You come here to harass me in front
of my home? Look where I live.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.327
Get out.
Come on. Let's go.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.092
Your verdict?
I don't know. He's a jerk.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.261
Insolent, arrogant.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.590
You tell me. Would you
choose this guy as a spy?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.760
I don't see how
he's a security risk.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.222
I say we close it.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.978
This could be your
last case, John.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.568
Lee Oswald. Then I'm done.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.936
Twenty and out.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.986
FBI.

24:44.274 --> 24:47.198
In Russia it's KGB.
Here it's FBI.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.450
What is that?

24:52.533 --> 24:54.206
Where did you get
the money for that?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.830
I told you not to let
her in this house.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.258
How can I say no?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.757
Marina, you just do what I say.
You understand? That's it.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.885
You just do as I say.
I'm the man in this house.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.225
You're not a man.
You're a little boy.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.521
They're afraid of me. They're the
FBI, and they're afraid of me.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.020
Everyone afraid of Alik.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.818
They've been following me
and persecuting me.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.525
It's good. I take Junka,
we go see people.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.904
It's good for baby.

25:26.984 --> 25:27.985
Ah!

25:30.571 --> 25:32.164
You don't need to go out there.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.287
Don't open that door.
Don't let them in.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.705
You understand?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.335
I'm the man of this house.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.756
Not gonna be no peace.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.933
You're watching me?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.396
Then I'm watching you, too.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.813
Good morning, Mac.
It's not so good, Mr. President.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.740
Our U-2 spy planes have confirmed
that the Russians have placed

26:06.815 --> 26:09.068
offensive nuclear
missiles in Cuba.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.163
Hello, Jack.
Isn't this a nice surprise?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.419
Just wanted to hear your voice.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.624
Jack, is something the matter?

26:27.127 --> 26:29.596
Jackie, why don't you come
back to the White House.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.717
Yes, of course.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.771
<i>At a Pentagon
briefing here this evening,</i>

26:37.888 --> 26:41.358
<i>we were shown pictures taken
by a high-flying U-2 plane</i>

26:41.433 --> 26:42.980
<i>of two types of missiles,</i>

26:43.060 --> 26:45.188
<i>some of them already
installed in Cuba</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:47.523
<i>and pointed at
the US heartland.</i>

26:47.606 --> 26:51.031
<i>One group of missiles
with a range of 1,200 miles,</i>

26:51.110 --> 26:54.159
<i>the other group
with ranges up to 2,500 miles.</i>

26:54.279 --> 26:57.874
<i>And there was a broad hint,
they do have nuclear warheads.</i>

26:57.950 --> 27:01.796
<i>We have increased the number of planes
in our air defense along the East Coast,</i>

27:01.870 --> 27:06.671
<i>and we have placed all US forces
around the world on an alert status.</i>

27:06.750 --> 27:09.048
I say we launch a full-scale
attack and invasion.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.721
B-52s out of Barksdale.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.890
What, and start
a war with Russia?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.344
You really want to risk
an all-out nuclear war?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.730
In a matter of days, those missiles
will be operational. We have to act.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.432
I will not be pushed.

27:21.515 --> 27:25.065
Not by Khrushchev,
not by you or anyone else.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.819
One thing's for certain, I'm not gonna
allow nuclear missiles in our backyard.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.365
I want to see a limited
military option.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.067
I want to hear something
out of State.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.245
You haven't said a word
the whole meeting.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.287
I want options in 40 minutes.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.247
What's happening?

27:45.622 --> 27:47.499
We're in a fix.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.226
I have 40 minutes before
I have to start again.

27:58.302 --> 28:02.023
I keep thinking about
Khrushchev in The Kremlin.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.646
He's in the same position I am.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.352
Anti-spasmodic.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.105
He doesn't want to back down.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.026
I don't want to back down.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.990
Hydrocortisone.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.120
I have to find a way
for him to back down.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.209
And testosterone.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.958
And not lose face.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.712
You'll find a way.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.716
You'll find a way.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.224
What if I don't?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.688
<i>Men and women the
world over hang on the news</i>

28:42.763 --> 28:45.482
<i>as it is uncertain
what the future holds.</i>

28:45.557 --> 28:48.982
<i>All of the Western Hemisphere,
from Hudson Bay to Lima, Peru,</i>

28:49.061 --> 28:51.314
<i>are within the range
of the missiles in Cuba.</i>

28:52.105 --> 28:55.905
<i>In these troubled times,
America braces for disaster.</i>

28:57.152 --> 29:00.531
Please don't send
me away to Camp David.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.751
I just want to be with you.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.753
Even if there isn't room
in the bomb shelter,

29:06.828 --> 29:09.251
I just want to be on the lawn
when it happens.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.211
I just want to die with you.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.684
Everybody's gonna like it.
Everybody's Russian.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.438
All your nosy Russian friends.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.602
George tried to get you a job.
He's nice to invite us.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.107
You're the one
they invited, not me.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.739
All right. I'll be good.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.615
There they are!
Marinitchka!

29:40.153 --> 29:41.200
Lee!
George.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.958
Hurry. The President
is about to start his speech.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.999
Quiet, please.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.545
Ready in...

29:53.959 --> 29:57.509
Five, four, three, two...

30:01.633 --> 30:03.431
<i>Good evening, my fellow citizens.</i>

30:04.052 --> 30:07.556
This government, as promised,

30:07.639 --> 30:11.234
has maintained the
closest surveillance

30:11.310 --> 30:13.733
of the Soviet military buildup

30:13.812 --> 30:15.564
on the island of Cuba.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.365
Within the past week,

30:17.441 --> 30:20.490
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

30:21.028 --> 30:24.623
that a series of
offensive missile sites

30:25.157 --> 30:27.080
is now in preparation

30:27.576 --> 30:29.203
on that imprisoned island.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.919
<i>The purpose of these bases
can be none other</i>

30:32.998 --> 30:36.502
<i>than to provide
nuclear strike capabilities</i>

30:37.002 --> 30:38.845
<i>against the Western Hemisphere.</i>

30:39.880 --> 30:42.178
<i>To halt this offensive buildup,</i>

30:42.257 --> 30:46.854
<i>a strict quarantine on all
offensive military equipment</i>

30:46.928 --> 30:49.397
<i>under shipment to Cuba
is being initiated.</i>

30:49.473 --> 30:50.895
A quarantine? That's illegal.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.193
<i>All ships of
any kind bound for Cuba,</i>

30:54.019 --> 30:55.896
<i>from whatever nation
or port will,</i>

30:56.480 --> 30:59.575
<i>if found to contain
cargoes of offensive weapons,</i>

30:59.649 --> 31:00.741
<i>be turned back.</i>

31:02.486 --> 31:04.864
The Soviets have every
right to be there,

31:04.946 --> 31:07.790
and Cuba has every right to defend
itself against the United States.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.119
But why would Russia
be so foolish as to provoke?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.421
No, no. Kennedy is the one
who's provoking this.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.666
I think Kennedy is doing a good job.
On civil rights, yes.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.376
But he is wrong on Cuba.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.929
Your Cubans are just as greedy and
hypocritical as your Russians.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.674
You fled one failed
cause for another.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.762
Cuba is the last great hope for
Marxism, unless Kennedy destroys it.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.138
Well, I grant you this much.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.771
Your hero Fidel is the underdog,
and I like underdogs.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.226
This is why I like you, Lee.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.191
Kennedy needs to
keep out of Cuba.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.449
Or what? What will you
and your underdogs do to him?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.162
Lee!
I'm playing with you, huh?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.493
I am serious!

31:52.619 --> 31:55.168
Something has to be
done to protect Cuba.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.293
<i>Cuba has to be the
point of the crisis.</i>

31:59.376 --> 32:02.425
<i>There might be shooting
among the ships at sea.</i>

32:02.587 --> 32:07.013
<i>If invasion is undertaken, the Russians
have said that they would retaliate.</i>

32:07.175 --> 32:10.349
<i>We have said if there's rocket
fire from Cuba, we will retaliate.</i>

32:10.429 --> 32:13.228
<i>The shooting war could
start tomorrow over Cuba.</i>

32:16.017 --> 32:17.564
How could Khrushchev do that?

32:17.894 --> 32:20.397
Last night, he sent you a cable
saying he'd pull those missiles out.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.357
And now this
public announcement

32:22.441 --> 32:24.409
demanding we pull
our missiles out of Turkey.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.784
He's already given in.
Now he wants to make deals?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.959
What if you just ignore this?

32:38.665 --> 32:40.463
He's under pressure.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.637
The Kremlin won't let him back down.

32:43.712 --> 32:47.342
And I'll be goddamned if I'm
gonna engage in a quid pro quo.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.559
You. Just you.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.520
You go to the Soviet
Ambassador and you tell him

32:56.600 --> 32:59.149
that I have accepted
Khrushchev's original offer.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.816
It just might work, Jack.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.363
I hope to God it does.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.627
<i>Just yesterday,
we were on the brink of</i>

33:15.702 --> 33:18.876
<i>nuclear war with the
Soviet Union.</i>

33:18.955 --> 33:20.753
<i>Today, we can
all breathe easier.</i>

33:20.832 --> 33:24.382
<i>Nikita Khrushchev today did
precisely what President Kennedy</i>

33:24.461 --> 33:28.182
<i>has been asking him to do
ever since this crisis began.</i>

33:29.424 --> 33:32.769
<i>He ordered the dismantling of
Soviet missile bases in Cuba</i>

33:32.844 --> 33:36.064
<i>and the return of the rockets
to the Soviet Union.</i>

33:43.313 --> 33:45.407
Maybe tonight's the night
I should go to the theater.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.401
Marina!

35:09.941 --> 35:11.158
Marina!

35:12.652 --> 35:13.904
I want you to take my picture.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.330
Where do you find <i>pistoleti?</i>

35:15.405 --> 35:17.749
I got it in the mail.
Here. Come here.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.910
Come here. Take it.
Come, come, come.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.586
Take my picture.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.794
I want you to take this for Junie
to remember her papa by sometime.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.336
All right. Then send
it to the papers.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.513
To show them I'm ready
for anything. Take it.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.392
Wind that little thing, and you're gonna
push that little lever down. Okay?

35:36.468 --> 35:37.640
This?
Yeah.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.099
Hold on.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.911
George, you've heard of this
General Edwin Walker?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.037
Of course.

36:00.116 --> 36:03.370
He's the crazy racist John Bircher who
caused all that trouble at Ole Miss.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.081
And now he wants the United
States to invade Cuba.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.383
He's going all over the
country attacking communism.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.630
And Castro.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.296
You know, Walker lives
right here in Dallas.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.557
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.305
Really?

36:20.845 --> 36:23.598
What if someone killed Hitler
before he came to power?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.311
I ask you, how many lives
could have been saved?

36:27.435 --> 36:30.655
Anybody who bumps that bastard off
will be doing the world a favor.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.903
Who's hungry?

36:32.982 --> 36:37.488
<i>I would betray the confidence
reposed in me by the American people</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:40.119
<i>if I had not warned you
of the menace of communism</i>

36:40.198 --> 36:43.498
<i>and the peril facing
this nation today.</i>

36:49.666 --> 36:51.839
<i>Mr. Oswald, why did
you shoot General Walker?</i>

36:52.794 --> 36:56.344
<i>General Walker wanted to invade
Cuba and overthrow Castro.</i>

36:56.423 --> 36:59.597
<i>He was a racist who was a
threat to civil rights.</i>

37:01.886 --> 37:05.561
<i>Mr. Oswald, what do you say to those
who will call you a murderer?</i>

37:06.641 --> 37:10.145
<i>In time, they will see that I stopped
a dangerous man on his rise to power.</i>

37:11.146 --> 37:15.026
<i>They will see me as a hero,
as a hunter of fascists.</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:17.949
<i>And long after I'm gone,
they will remember this day</i>

37:18.027 --> 37:20.530
<i>as the day that changed
the world forever.</i>

37:21.114 --> 37:23.208
<i>Thank you, Mr. Oswald.
You are a true...</i>

37:23.283 --> 37:25.206
Alik?
This is my office.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.249
I know it's late. You can't come
in here. Leave me alone.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.967
Who's got you, June bug?

37:40.049 --> 37:43.519
June bug! Cutie, cutie!
Cutie, cutie! Who's got you?

37:44.345 --> 37:46.894
That's right. Come here.
Papa's got you.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.480
There you are.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.530
Papa's gonna be president someday.
President?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.572
Well, I could be
in 20 years or so.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.704
How you be famous, huh?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.874
How you be president
if you don't do anything?

38:04.073 --> 38:06.292
How do you think
Kennedy became president?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.578
His daddy bought it for him.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.663
'Cause money buys everything here.
You know that.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.425
Very handsome.
Hey!

38:17.837 --> 38:20.807
You know you're not supposed
to say that about other men.

38:24.511 --> 38:27.765
Well, if not me, then your
brother will be president.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.617
<i>I left you as much
money as I could.</i>

38:39.692 --> 38:41.694
<i>$60 on the second of the month.</i>

38:42.362 --> 38:46.458
<i>You and the baby can live for another
two months using $10 a week.</i>

38:46.699 --> 38:48.542
<i>If I'm alive and
taken prisoner,</i>

38:48.618 --> 38:50.871
<i>the city jail is located
at the end of the bridge,</i>

38:50.954 --> 38:53.673
<i>through which we always passed
on going to the city.</i>

38:53.748 --> 38:55.375
<i>This is the key to the mailbox</i>

38:55.458 --> 38:59.053
<i>which is located in the main post
office in the city on Ervay Street.</i>

38:59.128 --> 39:01.130
<i>You will find the mailbox
in the post office</i>

39:01.214 --> 39:04.309
<i>which is located four blocks from
the drugstore on that street.</i>

39:04.384 --> 39:07.137
<i>I paid for the box last month,
so don't worry about it.</i>

39:07.887 --> 39:10.606
<i>Send the information as to what
has happened to me to the embassy</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:12.104
<i>and include
newspaper clippings,</i>

39:12.183 --> 39:14.982
<i>should there be anything
about me in the newspapers.</i>

39:15.061 --> 39:16.781
<i>I believe that the embassy
will come quickly</i>

39:16.813 --> 39:19.817
<i>to your assistance
on learning everything.</i>

39:19.899 --> 39:23.449
<i>I paid the house rent on the
2-D, so don't worry about it.</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:26.452
<i>Recently I also paid
the water and gas.</i>

39:26.531 --> 39:29.080
<i>The money from work
will possibly be coming.</i>

39:29.158 --> 39:31.832
<i>Certain of my documents
are in the small blue valise.</i>

39:32.579 --> 39:35.833
<i>The address book can be found on the table
in the study, should you need the same.</i>

39:36.165 --> 39:39.419
<i>The Red Cross will also help you.
Red Cross in English.</i>

39:40.670 --> 39:44.095
<i>You can either throw out or give
my clothing, etcetera, away.</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:47.768
<i>However, I prefer that you
hold on to my personal papers.</i>

40:10.867 --> 40:12.119
I did it.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.380
I shot General Edwin Walker.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.051
I just killed a very dangerous man.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.386
Police here?

40:33.389 --> 40:36.438
Why?
Why you shoot a man?

40:38.478 --> 40:40.401
To show that I'm ready.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.070
To show everyone.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.742
And now, people will
think I'm a hero.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.833
<i>And now
we bring you a special report.</i>

40:59.916 --> 41:03.011
<i>We have just learned that there
has been an assassination attempt</i>

41:03.086 --> 41:05.930
<i>on the life of General Edwin A.
Walker of Dallas.</i>

41:06.005 --> 41:09.885
<i>Walker was sitting at a desk in his home
when a bullet came through his window.</i>

41:09.968 --> 41:11.845
<i>The bullet narrowly
missed Walker.</i>

41:11.928 --> 41:13.680
<i>According to federal
authorities,</i>

41:13.763 --> 41:17.233
<i>a neighbor witnessed two men in
an alley behind Walker's house</i>

41:17.308 --> 41:19.185
<i>get into their cars
and drive away.</i>

41:19.268 --> 41:21.066
Walker...
You're kidding me.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.277
You're kidding me! Two men?

41:23.773 --> 41:25.116
Two men.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.281
The FBI is stupid!

41:27.443 --> 41:29.036
God damn it.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.922
Alik?
I had him.

41:40.206 --> 41:44.928
He must have moved his head at the last
minute. My aim was perfect. I know it.

41:45.128 --> 41:46.505
God damn it.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.362
Damn it, damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it, damn it.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.733
I was happy to see that in the
end it worked out for you down there.

42:11.738 --> 42:12.785
What happened?

42:12.864 --> 42:16.664
Well, the party's been going to
hell over the last six years.

42:16.826 --> 42:21.081
I don't mean to throw any stones at
the man, but Daniel. Price Daniel.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.962
Well, we have no leadership.

42:23.124 --> 42:25.752
But we've made inroads
with that since the election.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.007
No, you've done all right.

42:27.253 --> 42:30.757
Except that they've got a lot of
organization on that side of the party.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.308
This is true.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.385
Well, the way
I see it, it looks like

42:34.761 --> 42:36.809
it could very well
come down to Texas again,

42:37.430 --> 42:40.604
and we're gonna need the money and
the votes and we do something for it.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.276
What's the plan?

42:42.602 --> 42:44.445
Well, I defer to the governor.

42:46.022 --> 42:50.198
Maybe I can host a
dinner in Austin.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.244
The three of us on a tour.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.331
We do Austin,
San Antonio and Dallas.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.785
No, not Dallas. You lost the hell
out of Dallas by 60,000 votes.

42:58.868 --> 43:02.122
I lost by 20,000.
They just murdered all of us.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.624
That's why we're
gonna change that.

43:04.874 --> 43:05.841
What looks good, Kenny?

43:05.917 --> 43:07.464
Dallas isn't safe.

43:07.877 --> 43:12.098
Housewives came out of their houses to
spit on me during the '60 campaign.

43:12.715 --> 43:16.185
November. Say a week
before Thanksgiving.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.387
All right.
Let's book it.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.489
Marina.

43:29.899 --> 43:32.573
Marina, goddamn it,
where are my guns?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.243
Nixon's in town.
I want to have a look.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.076
Why need gun for look?

43:46.749 --> 43:48.751
Promise me you'll
never shoot no more people.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.337
Okay, I promise.

43:50.419 --> 43:51.966
Promise me you'll get job.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.566
Every time I get a job, the damn
FBI tells them I'm a communist.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.968
No! It's not good here.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.849
Why? Why you bring us here?
Dallas no good.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.100
Well, maybe I'll go
to New Orleans.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.027
Maybe they won't follow me there.
I'll get a job down there.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.109
Okay.

44:14.235 --> 44:15.578
Is better.

44:18.906 --> 44:19.998
Alik.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.286
I promise.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.414
I promise, Mama.

44:34.714 --> 44:35.931
Yes.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.479
Thank you.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.321
Fair play for Cuba? Tell the President
to keep his hands off Cuba.

44:57.403 --> 45:01.124
Fair play for Cuba.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.624
Fair play for Cuba?

45:02.700 --> 45:03.872
I ask you, what do you
know about Cuba?

45:03.951 --> 45:05.419
I'm recruiting for the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

45:05.494 --> 45:08.168
I'm from Cuba.
I know Cuba.

45:08.581 --> 45:10.834
Our homeland was taken from us
by a communist dictator.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.756
The Cuban people want
Castro as their leader.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.258
No, he's a killer. He sent
our children to execution.

45:15.338 --> 45:16.806
Give me those!

45:16.881 --> 45:18.724
This man is a communist!
I have rights!

45:18.799 --> 45:20.051
He's an agent of Castro!

45:20.176 --> 45:21.268
Go back to Cuba!

45:29.310 --> 45:30.562
You FBI?

45:31.479 --> 45:33.982
I asked specifically
to speak to an FBI agent.

45:34.065 --> 45:35.191
Yes.

45:35.274 --> 45:36.400
I'm Agent John Quigley.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.903
This is supposed
to be a free country.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.954
I was arrested for exercising
my right to free speech

45:41.030 --> 45:42.703
and I've been here
all night long.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.955
I understand that you
and the other three men

45:45.034 --> 45:46.627
were charged with
disturbing the peace.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.204
I did not disturb the peace.

45:48.621 --> 45:49.964
I was attacked for my beliefs.

45:50.039 --> 45:52.167
You're pro-Cuba?
Pro-Castro?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.594
I belong to
Fair Play for Cuba, yes.

45:55.711 --> 45:58.635
And who is AJ Hidell?

45:58.714 --> 46:01.638
Hidell. He issued that
membership card to me.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.388
Mr. Hidell is the president
of the committee.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.183
Hidell is name you make up.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.069
You tell FBI Hidell
rhyme with Fidel?

46:12.645 --> 46:15.023
Tell FBI you want
name our baby Fidel?

46:16.315 --> 46:19.444
All you do all day,
pass out Cuba paper.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.909
Still no job.
Only Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.329
You know, Cuba
not care about you.

46:25.408 --> 46:26.409
Marina!

46:30.579 --> 46:34.174
Look at you. Great man,
genius, and no one knows it.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.296
You're going back to Texas.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.303
You call that friend of yours, the
one you gave the Russian lessons to.

46:41.382 --> 46:42.554
Tell her to come
get you and Junie.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.510
Ruth? You no like Ruth.

46:44.593 --> 46:46.313
She'll take care of you
till the baby comes.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.206
Marina, as soon as
you get back to Dallas...

47:10.619 --> 47:12.496
When you get back to...

47:36.062 --> 47:37.663
<i>I need to go
to Cuba immediately.</i>

47:37.730 --> 47:38.731
I have to.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.863
I am sorry, but as I explained,
you will need a Soviet visa.

47:42.485 --> 47:44.203
You're not listening to me.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.409
I need you to make
an exception.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.992
I've proven my support
of President Castro.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.919
Mr. Oswald, I am telling you,
it will take four months.

47:52.495 --> 47:57.296
No, I don't have enough money to
stay in Mexico for four months.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.343
Then go back to the United
States, and you wait.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.509
I'm being harassed in the United States.
I am sorry, Mr. Oswald.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.761
I'm being persecuted
and followed by the FBI

48:04.840 --> 48:06.842
because of my support
of President Castro,

48:06.926 --> 48:09.429
your leader who they have
sought to overthrow.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.932
Don't you care about your own country?
Go home, Mr. Oswald.

48:17.186 --> 48:18.483
I don't have a home.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.064
That's not my home.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.589
<i>The dramatic miracle
of birth and a fight for life</i>

48:40.668 --> 48:43.922
<i>takes place at the Otis Air
Force Base Hospital on Cape Cod</i>

48:44.004 --> 48:47.008
<i>as Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy
bears a premature son.</i>

48:47.299 --> 48:50.803
<i>The baby, the first to be born to
a White House family in 68 years,</i>

48:50.886 --> 48:54.641
<i>was the object of worldwide attention
during his dramatic fight for life.</i>

49:26.422 --> 49:27.924
You all right?

49:29.842 --> 49:31.435
Yes, of course.

49:32.595 --> 49:35.348
I'm all set. My car will
take me to the airport.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.037
Oh, Jackie.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.752
I was so stupid.

50:00.623 --> 50:01.715
Jack.

50:03.292 --> 50:05.636
I already lost two.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.009
I wasn't ready to
lose another one.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.219
It's not your fault.

50:16.472 --> 50:18.315
God called him back,

50:19.433 --> 50:21.060
our baby Patrick.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.826
We had him for two days.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.658
He was a beautiful baby.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.747
And he fought so hard.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.005
Like a Kennedy.

50:51.507 --> 50:55.011
Well, you'll go away
for two weeks,

50:56.762 --> 51:00.687
get out on the water,
enjoy the Greek Islands.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.518
I want you to rest.

51:03.310 --> 51:06.940
And... Look at me.

51:09.024 --> 51:12.278
I want you to be very careful
around that Onassis character.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.033
And then I want you
to come back to me.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.540
Of course I will.

51:22.621 --> 51:25.875
The one thing
I could never bear

51:29.169 --> 51:30.967
would be to lose you.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.476
You say you just found
a job here in Dallas?

51:39.597 --> 51:42.100
Yes, ma'am, that's right.
Are you married?

51:42.182 --> 51:43.479
No.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.732
I mean, yes, I was, ma'am.

51:46.353 --> 51:49.072
Well, this will be your room, Mr...

51:50.065 --> 51:51.692
Mr. Lee you said?

51:52.067 --> 51:54.320
That's right. Lee.
OH Lee.

51:54.612 --> 51:56.364
Well, make yourself comfortable.

51:58.907 --> 52:01.786
<i>I contacted the CIA.
Said he visited the Cuban Embassy</i>

52:01.869 --> 52:03.462
<i>and maybe the
Soviet Embassy as well.</i>

52:03.537 --> 52:05.005
What is he, some kind of spy?

52:05.080 --> 52:06.502
<i>They don't know what he is.</i>

52:06.582 --> 52:09.005
<i>They think he may have gone back
to Dallas. They're not sure.</i>

52:09.084 --> 52:12.054
All right, well, I'll try
to find this Oswald fellow.

52:27.811 --> 52:28.812
Ruth Paine?

52:28.896 --> 52:30.523
Yes. Can I help you?

52:30.648 --> 52:35.199
Hi. I'm Special Agent James Hosty,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.913
I'm looking for Lee Oswald.

52:39.448 --> 52:41.041
Do you mind if I come in?

52:41.116 --> 52:42.868
Yes, please come in.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.586
Thank you.

52:46.955 --> 52:51.301
Their friend George introduced us,
and Marina and I became friends.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.134
So when she and Lee
had their problems,

52:54.213 --> 52:56.974
I went down to New Orleans and brought
her back here to have her baby.

52:57.049 --> 52:59.302
And Mr. Oswald is still
in New Orleans?

52:59.385 --> 53:01.638
No. He lost his job there,
so he came back.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.314
He's living here?
No, I won't allow that.

53:04.556 --> 53:05.773
And Marina won't either.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.977
He keeps some of his things
out in my garage,

53:08.060 --> 53:09.937
and he comes weekends
to see his girls.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.647
But Marina doesn't
want him here.

53:11.772 --> 53:12.989
Do you know where he is?

53:13.065 --> 53:15.659
I should think he's at work.
Where does he work?

53:15.734 --> 53:18.362
At the Texas School
Book Depository.

53:18.487 --> 53:21.491
Marina, this is FBI Agent Hosty.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.041
FBI?

53:26.954 --> 53:28.706
No, he's not here to harm you.

53:28.831 --> 53:31.254
No. No, our job is
to protect people.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.637
You find Oswald?

53:43.721 --> 53:47.692
Sort of. I know where he's working,
but I don't know where he's living.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.519
He'll show up sooner or later.

54:20.466 --> 54:22.139
I missed you, kid.

54:23.719 --> 54:25.392
I missed you, too.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.733
Maybe you'll come
on the road with me?

54:31.101 --> 54:33.900
Come to Texas,
help me with the campaign?

54:35.856 --> 54:37.733
Of course I will, Jack.

54:38.484 --> 54:41.283
I'll campaign with you
anywhere you want.

54:43.530 --> 54:47.580
Good. We'll be back on the 25th, in
time for John Junior's birthday.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.979
Excuse me.

55:09.431 --> 55:10.603
Mister?

55:11.517 --> 55:14.771
Is that a 6.5 Italian carbie?
Yeah.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.943
And is that
a four-power scope?

55:18.398 --> 55:19.775
Yes, it is.

55:21.735 --> 55:25.114
You'll get that good. Just a
little more practice is all.

55:25.864 --> 55:27.616
Now, what did I tell you
about the chamber?

55:27.699 --> 55:29.779
You always got to empty it
when you lay the gun down.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.294
Alik?
What?

55:36.583 --> 55:39.052
Junka wants to know why her papa
hasn't played with her today.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.221
All right, okay. I'll be
there in just a minute.

55:42.464 --> 55:45.217
We wouldn't have this problem
if Ruth would let me live here.

55:48.470 --> 55:49.847
Just mind your
business, Marina.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.150
Go.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.671
What do you say, Jack?
Hey, Harry, how are you?

56:23.422 --> 56:24.514
Mike.

56:24.673 --> 56:26.266
I volunteered to
work the parade

56:26.341 --> 56:28.142
so I can get a good look
at President Kennedy.

56:28.218 --> 56:30.516
Who wants to see that traitor?
He should be shot.

56:30.679 --> 56:33.683
Hey, I like Kennedy. How can
you say something like that?

56:33.932 --> 56:36.685
I mean, in my own place,
about our beloved president.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.029
And the both of them, the
President and Mrs. Kennedy.

56:39.104 --> 56:40.606
I love them.
I love them both.

56:41.356 --> 56:42.903
Hey. Hey, TORY!

56:43.358 --> 56:44.450
What the hell's wrong
with you, huh?

56:44.526 --> 56:46.119
Can't you see my friends
need some drinks here?

56:46.194 --> 56:48.196
What are you, blind?
I'm sorry, Mr. Ruby.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.204
Don't apologize. Just take
care of my pals here, okay?

56:51.283 --> 56:52.876
Come on, let's go.
Chop chop.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.339
Air Force One arrives
at Love Field at 11:40 a.m.

56:57.998 --> 57:00.877
The President and First Lady will
be met by Johnson and Lady Bird,

57:00.959 --> 57:02.632
Governor Connally and his wife.

57:02.711 --> 57:05.385
We allow a few minutes
for the receiving line.

57:05.464 --> 57:07.512
So around noon, the motorcade
leaves the airport.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.889
We stay about 30 miles
an hour out by the airport.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.471
So, it's downtown
around 20 minutes later.

57:12.554 --> 57:15.728
Now, the parade will travel
down Main Street here.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.859
We slow to 15 miles an hour

57:17.935 --> 57:19.983
so the crowds can get
a good look at Lancer.

57:20.062 --> 57:23.282
These tail buildings on either
side, this is like a canyon.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.015
There's more than 20,000 windows
along this parade route.

57:26.026 --> 57:27.573
We'll be sitting ducks.

57:27.653 --> 57:30.873
We have to assume the President's car
will be open, unless it's raining.

57:30.948 --> 57:33.201
Here at Dealey Plaza,
we make a right on Houston.

57:33.283 --> 57:35.251
Can't we avoid this?

57:35.327 --> 57:37.375
There's a 120-degree
turn onto Elm.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.255
It's gonna slow the
motorcade down to a crawl.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.838
No. The only way under the
Stemmons Freeway is from Elm.

57:44.086 --> 57:45.759
This town makes me nervous.

57:46.755 --> 57:49.178
You know Dallas is the murder
capital of the country.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.009
We did a thorough check of
active threats to the President.

57:51.093 --> 57:53.016
There are none in Texas.

57:53.095 --> 57:54.972
We checked with the FBI.
Nothing came up.

57:55.055 --> 57:57.274
Yeah. Let's pray for rain.

57:59.559 --> 58:01.311
<i>The city
of Dallas is busy preparing</i>

58:01.436 --> 58:03.037
<i>for the President
and First Lady's visit.</i>

58:03.105 --> 58:04.448
<i>We don't have
all the details yet,</i>

58:04.523 --> 58:06.651
<i>but we do know that the
President and First Lady</i>

58:06.775 --> 58:09.295
<i>will drive through downtown on the
way to the Dallas Trade Mart,</i>

58:09.403 --> 58:11.201
<i>where the President
will give a speech.</i>

58:11.279 --> 58:13.498
<i>We'll keep you updated
as we learn more.</i>

58:58.577 --> 59:02.081
Frazier, can I get a ride
home with you after work?

59:02.164 --> 59:04.258
Yeah, of course,
like I told you.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.835
You can get a ride
any time you want.

59:07.836 --> 59:12.262
Hey, Lee, you don't see your girls
till Friday. It's Thursday.

59:12.340 --> 59:14.809
I just gotta pick up
some curtain rods.

59:21.641 --> 59:22.688
Hi.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.153
Alik.

59:27.355 --> 59:28.732
I'm lonesome for my girls.

59:30.275 --> 59:31.697
You only come weekends,
not now.

59:35.197 --> 59:36.915
Mama, please don't be that way.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.709
Please, Mama. I miss you.
I miss our girls. I'm lonely.

59:40.160 --> 59:43.255
You're always lonely, Alik.
We can start over, you know?

59:44.039 --> 59:46.159
We can. I promise you, I'll
be so different this time.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.960
You never different.

59:48.085 --> 59:50.554
Please. I can be.
For you, I can be.

59:51.046 --> 59:53.390
I'll buy you that washing
machine that you always wanted.

59:56.968 --> 59:57.969
<i>Nyet.</i>

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:06.570
Mama, I'm begging you.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.945
If you say no to me again,
I'm gonna...

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:15.287
This is the last time
that I will ever ask you.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.997
Please.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:30.048
If Ruth says yes,
you can stay tonight.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.423
But I won't return to you.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.380
It's raining, Mr. President.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:51.925
It's too bad.
Thank you, George.

01:01:58.173 --> 01:01:59.174
Have you seen this?

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.186
Yeah. We're headed
into nut country today.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.775
Ah! My favorite.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.322
I know.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.031
Those rich Texas society women,
they're gonna eat you up.

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:21.780
If it's so important
I look good,

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.241
why do I have to be blown
around in a motorcade

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.247
with you and Governor
Connally first?

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:29.125
I am so glad that you are here.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.377
It's so much better
when you're here.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.009
'Cause the one thing
I couldn't bear

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.962
would be to lose you.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.619
Morning, Lee.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.497
What's in the package?

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.621
Curtain rods.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:12.373
I wish it would just rain
or quit altogether.

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.672
If it's raining in Dallas, we'll
want a bubble top on the limo.

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:21.381
They say it's going
to clear up.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.430
Okay. If it does, no bubble.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:26.136
Well, be sure to get that in.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.937
Good morning, Lyndon.
Mr. President.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.982
<i>The Presidential
party will leave</i>

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.651
<i>Fort Worth on a quick
flight to Dallas,</i>

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:37.027
<i>where the motorcade will travel through
downtown on their way to the Trade Mart.</i>

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:41.909
Good morning!

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:48.701
<i>This crowd started gathering
out here quite early this morning</i>

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.753
<i>to ensure a good vantage point.</i>

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.047
<i>Air Force Number One,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.295
<i>carrying the President
of the United States.</i>

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.004
You gonna watch the parade?

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.181
Yeah. I want to
see the President.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.684
<i>There's Mrs. Kennedy,
and the crowd yells.</i>

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.017
<i>And the President
of the United States.</i>

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:19.318
<i>The President, now
partially obscured behind his wife...</i>

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:22.276
Yes, she is.
She's beautiful.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.863
Mrs. Kennedy coming along
behind him, grinning ah the while.

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:48.719
Boy, ain't you coming downstairs?
It's lunchtime.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:49.928
No, sir.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:07.195
The President now
in with the First Lady,

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:09.656
<i>and the motorcade
begins to move out.</i>

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.164
It cleared up.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.084
Should be here pretty soon now.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:29.401
<i>Here comes the first
car with Police Chief Jess Curry</i>

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.349
<i>and Sheriff Bill Decker.</i>

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.476
<i>And here is the President
of the United States.</i>

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.183
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.313
Here they come!

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:39.144
<i>We can...
And there's Jackie.</i>

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:41.070
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.615
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.489
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.787
<i>as the President and
the First Lady pass by.</i>

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:54.084
<i>There are people absolutely looking from
every window here in downtown Dallas.</i>

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.378
<i>It was a wonderful welcome
as the President</i>

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.626
<i>and Jacqueline Kennedy
passed our point.</i>

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:09.507
Here they come!

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:10.638
The President of the United States.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:14.347
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.397
<i>We can... And there's Jackie.</i>

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.316
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.860
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.734
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.736
<i>as the President and the
First Lady pass by.</i>

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.468
The shots came from the roof.
Clear the way!

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.447
Hold it!
Hold it right there!

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.491
You know this man?
Yeah, he works here.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.499
I saw him right up there,
one window from the top.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.917
- He had a rifle in the window.
- Slow down. Can you describe him?

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.671
White. 5'10", I guess.
160, 170 pounds.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.548
How old?
Thirty, I'd say.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.547
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.179
You'll excuse the fact
that I'm out of breath,

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.931
but about 10 or 15 minutes ago,

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:37.353
a tragic thing, from all
indications at this point,

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:38.850
has happened in
the city of Dallas.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:41.274
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:49.028
Mrs. Kennedy, please let
us help the President.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.699
You know he's dead.
Leave me alone.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:57.578
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.327
Here.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:16.560
<i>I heard three loud
shots, seemingly from right over my head.</i>

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.928
<i>Reports are in.</i>

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.475
<i>We now have heard
from two witnesses</i>

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:25.402
<i>who saw a man in the window of the
building above the route holding a gun.</i>

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:32.448
Yeah, this is Bobby.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.490
<i>Bobby, this is Director Hoover.</i>

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.406
<i>The President has been shot.</i>

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.229
<i>Here is a bulletin from CBS News.</i>

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:45.932
<i>In Dallas, Texas,</i>

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:50.645
<i>three shots were fired at President
Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.</i>

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:54.904
<i>The first reports say that President
Kennedy has been seriously wounded</i>

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.404
<i>by this shooting.</i>

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:59.579
<i>Repeating, President Kennedy
has been shot</i>

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.407
<i>by a would-be assassin
in Dallas, Texas.</i>

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.757
Governor Connally has been
taken upstairs for surgery.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.585
Well, how's the President?

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:15.511
It looks bad.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.473
He's still...

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.602
Somehow he's still breathing.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.064
The doctors are with him.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.019
I'm in your hands, Kenny.
What should I do?

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.197
I...

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:39.160
I'll let you know as soon as
I hear about the President.

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:43.155
Taxi!

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.544
500 North Beckley.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.544
What the hell?

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.219
I wonder what all the uproar is.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.442
I want to be with my husband.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kennedy.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.148
I want to be with my husband.
You can't.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.450
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.074
I'm going to get into that room.
No...

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.668
<i>The suspect in the
shooting at Elm and Houston</i>

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.841
<i>is reported to be
an unknown white male,</i>

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.795
<i>approximately 30, slender build,</i>

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:41.427
<i>height, 5'10", weight 165 pounds.</i>

<i>The First Lady is in the emergency
room with the President.</i>

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:53.943
<i>The crowd outside is quiet
and waiting for some word</i>

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.521
<i>of the condition of the President.</i>

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:11.831
You sure are in a hurry.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:22.847
Eternal rest grant unto him

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:27.393
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:31.146
May he rest in peace.
Amen.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:42.492
Captain Fritz,
I've taken a head count.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:43.864
We have one employee missing.

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:49.200
<i>His name is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.134
They want to
perform an autopsy.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.478
I'm not leaving without him, Kenny.
We have to take him home.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.932
I know.
They can't have him.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:16.234
I'm taking my husband
home with me.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:22.194
Okay, we'll call a mortuary.
We'll get a casket.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.026
We can get someone to bring you a
change of clothes from the plane.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:27.203
No. No.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:32.500
I want them to see
what they've done to Jack.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.418
He's gone.
Dear God.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.592
We need to get you out of here.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:47.093
What about Mrs. Kennedy?

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.800
She won't leave the President.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:50.806
I won't leave without
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.263
I'll take her back
with me on the plane.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:57.271
Mr. President,

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.733
can we release the
news to the press?

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:08.073
No, Id better get back to the plane
before you announce it.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:17.328
<i>From Dallas, Texas,
the flash apparently official,</i>

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:22.338

<i>and become the 36th President

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.707
I'm sorry? Step over to
the car please, sir.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:44.915
Look, I'm just walking.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.468
Sir, right now! I need
you to step to the car.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.508
Thank you, sir.
Where you headed?

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.769
I'm just walking through
the neighborhood. That's all.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:15:58.937
What's your name?

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.190
<i>Alik Adell.</i>

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:02.733
Can I see your hands, please?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.315
All right, sir. I'm gonna need you
to step to the front of the car.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.485
Right here. Sir, I need
to see your hands.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.366

- Hello. Police operator?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:47.149
<i>There's been a shooting. There's
been a shooting. An officer's been shot.</i>

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.855
What's your location?
Where's the officer?

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.111
<i>10th Street between
Marsalis and Beckley.</i>

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.988
<i>It's a police officer.
Somebody shot him.</i>

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.749
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.725
<i>Hosty. Jim, they think the
shooter is Lee Oswald.</i>

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:21.472
<i>Did you hear that?
Hey, hey! Quiet down, will you?</i>

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:24.769
No, I didn't hear that. What's the name?
Lee Oswald.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:42.912
This is it. It's all over now.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.833
He's got a gun!

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.291
Hold him down. Hold him
down. Secure him!

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:51.629
I'm not resisting.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:53.718
Got him?

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.046
I am not resisting arrest.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.223
All right, everyone.
Listen up. Listen up.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:59.050
I need somebody to
get a search warrant,

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.852
go out to this address and
pick up a man named Oswald.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.474
Lee Oswald?

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.814
That's the bastard
that shot Officer Tippit.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:07.517
What?
Captain, I'll save you the trip.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.819
We've got him right next door.

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:18.903
There he sits.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:26.752
They're saying
I shot a police officer.

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:28.579
What's your name?
I didn't shoot anyone.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:29.914
Where do you work?
All I did was

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:31.089
bring a gun into a theater.
That's all.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:33.839
I asked you where you work.
And this...

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:36.341
This is what your police force did to me.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.263
Sir?

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.771
This is Special Agent
James Hosty of the FBI.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:47.564
I know who you are.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.982
You're the man that's
been accosting my wife.

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:54.567
You leave her alone, you son of a bitch.
Hey, hey. Hold on.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:56.240
I asked her some
questions is all.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.363
You have any questions,
you can ask me.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:01.495
Understand?
Leave her alone. Ask me.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.082
Matter of fact, I have a
lot of questions for you.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.375
Let's begin with Mexico City.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:15.214
I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm done talking to him.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:19.214
FBI's the reason I've lost
every job I've ever had.

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:21.887
Goddamn FBI was following me.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:24.101
Hey, hey.
That's enough, boy.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:29.933
Your boss says you left the
building without permission.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.153
There was just so
much excitement

01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:39.279
that I didn't think there was gonna
be any more work today, so I left.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:41.447
I went to the movies.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.743
Miss Paine, we're with the Dallas
County Sheriff's Department.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.749
Mind if we have a look around?

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:54.521
Last time you saw your
husband was yesterday?

01:19:54.547 --> 01:19:55.115
Da.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:57.084
What time was that?

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:01.389
He came in the evening,
and he stayed last night.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.680
Can... Does he have
to touch that?

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:03.956
The kids are sleeping in there.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.513
Did you see him this morning?
<i>Nyet.</i>

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:07.014
Does she speak English?
What?

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:08.895
Does your husband own a rifle?
No, he doesn't.

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.182
Excuse me. That is
personal property. Okay?

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:12.437
Can you please put the...

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:16.065
<i>Da.</i> Yes.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.111
In the garage?
The garage!

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.954
Here?

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:41.345
Hey, Jack, I was just headed
over to the Carousel.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.515
It's closed. Closed for the
whole weekend in honor of...

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.843
I keep thinking about
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.973
The poor woman's going to have
to come back here for a trial.

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.226
She's gonna have
to go through all...

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:52.773
You okay, Jack?

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.601
Yeah. No... Yeah, yeah.

01:20:56.643 --> 01:20:58.361
Get a look at that creep yet?

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:01.782
No, but I think they're bringing
him out for the press pretty soon.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.359
Thanks, Harry.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.664
That's him! Did you kill
the President, Mr. Oswald?

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.582
I'd like some
legal representation.

01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:17.790
These police officers have
not allowed me to have any.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.218
I... I don't know
what this is all about.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.259
Did you kill the President? No, sir,
and people keep asking me that.

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.682
Did you shoot the President?
I work in that building.

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:28.259
Were you in the
building at that time?

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:30.265
Naturally, if I work
in the building, yes, sir.

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:31.766
Did you shoot the President?

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.974
No, they're taking me in because of
the fact I lived in the Soviet Union.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:37.151
Sir!
I'm just a patsy.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:04.503
No, no, they treatin' me fine.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.928
Alik...

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.308
Why? Why would you do this?
This is a mistake.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:17.016
This is all a mistake.
I'll have a trial.

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:19.526
I'm gonna show 'em all.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.658
You mustn't worry
about me, Mama.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.236
Come on. Get up.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.573
You kiss Junie and
Rachel for me? Hmm?

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:47.509
Oswald is being transported
this morning to the county jail.

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:49.215
Here he comes now.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:53.644
Captain Fritz, is this the man you
believe killed President Kennedy?

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.938
I think we have the right man.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:03.191
Okay, you wait
right here, Sheba.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:43.978
Here we go!

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.569
There he is! There he is!

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:24.352
<i>The man who shot Lee Oswald has been
identified as Jack Ruby. R-U-B-Y.</i>

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:26.820
<i>He runs a place in Dallas
called the Carousel Club,</i>

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:29.148
<i>which is a kind of
a strip joint and nightclub.</i>

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:30.858
<i>Here comes Oswald.</i>

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:34.787
<i>He is ashen and
unconscious at this time.</i>

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:36.738
<i>Now being moved in.
He's not moving.</i>

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:41.164
<i>The accused assassin of the President
and slayer of Officer Tippit,</i>

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:46.090
<i>24-year old Lee Harvey Oswald,
also went to his grave today</i>

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:49.543
<i>in a secret, almost unattended
funeral at Fort Worth.</i>

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:53.847
<i>The shooting,
which forever sealed his lips</i>

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:57.847
<i>and may have prevented police
from ever getting the full story</i>

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:03.023
<i>of what was behind the assassination
of the President of the United States.</i>

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:06.188
We don't have any pallbearers.

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:07.736
Come on, boys.

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.615
So now he is a legend,

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.877
when he would've
preferred to be a man.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:11.333
<i>Jack used to love to listen to the album
from the Broadway musical Camelot.</i>

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:16.430
<i>King Arthur and Lady Guinevere.</i>

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:20.305
He'd listen to it at night
before falling asleep.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.308
He loved the final line.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:29.234
<i>"Don't let it be forgot</i>

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:32.813
<i>"that once there was a spot,</i>

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:36.776
"for one brief shining moment,

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.156
"that was known as Camelot."
