WEBVTT

00:44.002 --> 00:45.754
So did you do it?
Did you get into the Green?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.297
Did you find out
where Frank is?

00:47.297 --> 00:50.467
Harls, I'm really trying
to focus here.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.302
Got it.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.388
-

01:00.310 --> 01:01.853
Sorry, it's not the chips.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.355
Accessing the Green
is just harder than I thought.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.817
It's like trying
to read a subway map
when you're hungover.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.611
You know what? I'm good.
I'm good.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.454
<i>Frank?</i>

01:19.454 --> 01:21.664
Where the fuck did you get
that needle from?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.541
That shit's longer than my arm.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.584
No. No!

01:24.584 --> 01:27.003
No! Fucking no.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.963
No!

01:29.047 --> 01:30.423
<i>No!</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:35.053
Frank's in trouble.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.304
Oh, no!

01:44.312 --> 01:45.355
I should have been able
to go deeper in the Green.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.523
I've done it before.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.649
I was Zen as hell.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.900
Maybe you just need a break.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.693
Yeah, but it should be
easy for me.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.780
The Green is a web
of interconnected
plant consciousness.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.948
That's me.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.325
My consciousness
should be connected.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.701
I must be doing
something wrong.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.370
Ive, I know how much
Frank means to you.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.580
I hate seeing you
suffer like this.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.543
As your girlfriend.
a psychiatrist, an avid watcher
of detective procedurals--

02:06.543 --> 02:08.711
We just need to get him back.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.797
I need some chamomile tea.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.882
Man, who drank
all the good stuff?

02:12.966 --> 02:16.594
I've only had one sip,
but I do tend to backwash.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
Okay, You know what?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.310
You're right.
I...

02:24.394 --> 02:28.273
I just need to clear my head
and take a little break.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.191
I think that's a great idea.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.693
Just clear your head...

02:31.693 --> 02:35.238
Actually, that works out
because remember those plans

02:35.238 --> 02:37.907
we made with Nora Freeze
two months ago?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.534
- I do not.
- Me neither.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.496
- But apparently they're tonight.
- Oh, God. Honey, cancel.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.044
She was frozen for 25 years.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.463
I think it's exactly
the kind of break
you both need.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.965
Just a dumb, fun night.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.758
This is my driver.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.594
We just did coke up the butt.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.264
See? It's gonna be chill.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.600
It's been nice having
you stay at the Manor.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.476
Equine excellence.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.396
Speaking of galloping,
I know the trek
to your wing is quite far,

03:08.396 --> 03:12.817
so I thought, you might want
to stay in my wing tonight.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.277
To do what?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.571
Well, if you decide to stay,
I got you something.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.909
I mean, uh...
so what do you think?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.201
Hmm?

03:22.285 --> 03:25.788
Tightly adhering
to something. Clingy.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.290
I could have Alfred
make us nachos.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.542
A good gift
would have been a silk bonnet,

03:29.626 --> 03:32.962
since your sheets
make sandpaper look like satin.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.548
I need to stay at my place
for a few nights.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.217
Don't cry.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.261
I never know what to do
with wealthy male tears.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.346
Cool. Cool.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.681
I could use some me time, too.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.523
<i>Alfred!
Gonna need some nachos.</i>

03:55.318 --> 03:57.487
Hey, summon the Cobb Squad!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.821
You want to drop acid?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.657
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.494
I believe Nora is going through
what is known as "some shit."

04:04.494 --> 04:07.372
Babe? Babe? Help me do
a Salchow axel.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.332
- Oh, yeah. Oh, oh...
- Yeah. Great.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.503
Okay. But, uh, guys,
we really need to be focusing
on finding Frank.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.130
- I can help.
- Uh, yeah. I think we're good.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.675
- You look like you got your hands full. So...
-

04:18.675 --> 04:21.928
This guy?
I don't give a fuck
about this guy.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.888
I want to hang with you guys.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.140
Ivy's got it, though.
You know, nobody's better
at the Green than her.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.518
Well. I would...
That's not entirely true.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.521
I think Swamp Thing is...
is stronger than I am.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.606
Yeah, we'll get some
kind of swamp thing to help.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.692
No, no, honey.
I meant Swamp Thing.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.568
He's a person.
Well, he's not actually
a person.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.029
He's like the consciousness
of a person.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.156
Put in a...

04:42.240 --> 04:43.950
- It's hard to explain.
- Is he hot?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.160
Um... He's like vines.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.414
Swamp Thing
is so powerful.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.999
He could...
Oh, by the way,

04:50.999 --> 04:53.084
he could find Frank
through the Green, like easy.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.086
So we'll call him
and tell him to find Frank.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.879
Yeah, but it's...
You can't do that.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.880
I mean, he hates me.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.008
He's an empath to all beings,

05:00.008 --> 05:01.968
and I'm obviously
anti-humanity,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.220
and he just didn't...
He didn't vibe with that.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.763
I could freeze him.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.349
What do you mean
you can freeze Swamp Thing?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
Yeah, I could freeze him.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.522
And then we'll tell him
we won't unfreeze him
until he agrees to help you.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.190
It's not a terrible idea.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.526
You know, he lives
in the swamps of New Orleans.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.363
- Love NO. Jazz.
- Oh, yeah!

05:22.447 --> 05:23.740
Trip to New Orleans!

05:23.740 --> 05:25.616
Where we are
gonna be laser-focused

05:25.700 --> 05:27.827
and find Frank,
and do whatever
makes my girlfriend feel good.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.245
One yard of margarita...

05:29.245 --> 05:31.122
Nope. Never mind. Just Frank.
We're on it.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.041
I would love to join,

05:33.041 --> 05:37.420
but the early call times shall
not allow for such a romp.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.007
I do so wish
I could dip a world famous
Du Monde's beignets

05:41.007 --> 05:43.301
into a fresh cup
of Java with you.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.220
Beignets!
Ivy, we gotta get a bag.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.932
Well, someone should stay
to feed Selina's cats.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.101
And they do seem to like me.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
Oh, sounds like
this is turning into a fun

05:54.437 --> 05:56.814
yet incredibly
focused girls trip!

05:56.898 --> 05:57.982
- Girls trip?
- Huh? Huh?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.942
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

06:00.026 --> 06:03.863
Uh, so this is about
finding Swamp Thing
so we can find Frank, right?

06:03.863 --> 06:04.906
It's not a party.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.618
Uh-uh.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.330
- I'm gonna explode if you don't give me some beads!
-

06:12.330 --> 06:15.458
- Nora, no. Bad girl.
- Nora, we're still at the airport.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.959
-
- Ouch!

06:18.086 --> 06:19.337
You have to leave.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.631
No, I'm pretty sure
I live here. Right?

06:21.631 --> 06:25.301
Fine. But you need
to find something
to do for the next six hours.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.095
Ooh! Six hours?

06:27.095 --> 06:33.309
Too much to see the city,
not enough to really
know the city.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.062
Oh! Hey, wait.
Can I just get my phone?

06:40.066 --> 06:40.942
Mmm.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.905
-

06:49.617 --> 06:51.494
Ugh! Ads.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.413
<i>We should call our son Bruce.
A perfect name for a son</i>

06:54.497 --> 06:55.832
<i>I will definitely see grow up.</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:57.458
A Hard Wayne's Gonna Fall.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.003
<i>Directed by James Gunn.
In theaters this fall.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:02.213
-
- Hmm?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.466
Hi, uh, Selina.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.262
Bruce.
I told you I needed
a little me-time.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.181
I know, but I was concerned
that you might be
feeling alone.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.350
Obviously, that's not
something I'm feeling.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.687
Uh, anyway.
I... I purchased
these two cats for you.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.315
Is the only thing
you know about me
that I like cats?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.234
These cats are special.
They're Persian.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.320
- I named them Martha and Thomas.
- After your dead parents?

07:26.404 --> 07:28.197
- I didn't realize.
-

07:28.281 --> 07:30.366
I just consider them
to be strong Christian names.

07:30.366 --> 07:35.037
I'm not taking
those Anglo-Saxon
pseudo parent cats, Bruce.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.334
- Can you carry Thomas and Martha to the car?
-

07:43.462 --> 07:45.506
Ugh! This place sucks.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.633
No one here is going to ask
to bite my neck.

07:47.717 --> 07:52.221
So I know that someone here
is going to know Swamp Thing.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.849
So let's just keep
a low profile, okay?

07:54.849 --> 07:56.809
And then we'll just
get outta here.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.021
I hear you're
looking for a thing
down in a swamp.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.564
Might I be of service?

08:07.111 --> 08:10.573
- Give us a ring. Won't you, love?
- John Constantine.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.574
Poison Ivy.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.992
Tell us where Swamp Thing is.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.995
I can't just go about
giving that information.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.872
Not for free, that is.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.958
I'll tell you where he is
if you can outdrink me.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.048
Let's make some shit disappear,
Criss Angel.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.258
I want Frank back,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.761
but this guy, he's bad news.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.431
Oh, Frank's lucky
to have a friend like you.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.767
I don't have
any friends like that.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.520
They crave the old Nora,
but I don't know
what to tell them.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.940
-
- Wow. So vulnerable.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.234
I... Is there anything
you'd like to add,

08:46.234 --> 08:49.278
now that we're letting
our walls down?

08:49.362 --> 08:54.033
Hey, Constantine.
Bring your Houdini ass
over here and let's do this.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.801
Hello?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.469
Where are you guys?

09:13.469 --> 09:15.680
<i>You were supposed to meet me
at the swamp an hour ago.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:17.890
What the hell
happened last night?

09:17.974 --> 09:21.102
Ugh, I outdrank
Constantine, and he told me
where Swamp Thing was.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.813
<i>Then we said
we'd meet at the swamp
after you got beignets--</i>

09:23.813 --> 09:26.691
- My beignets!
- Um...

09:26.691 --> 09:28.985
- Where are you?
- Connie has a map.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.695
Check his pockets.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.989
<i>And if you see my room key,
could you grab that, too?</i>

09:34.490 --> 09:36.742
Oh, I have that bra
and that one too.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.160
Oh, that one, too.
Mmm-hmm.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.336
Okay. We'll be at
the swamp ASAP.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.713
<i>Just look out for Swamp Thing.</i>

09:48.713 --> 09:50.464
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
I'll be--

09:52.008 --> 09:54.844
I cannot believe
we missed getting beignets.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.681
Honey, I'll buy ya 100 beignets
when we find Frank, okay?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.850
I know that's a promise
you're making
while you're stressed,

10:00.850 --> 10:02.476
but I'm holding you to it.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.478
Oh, my God!
We should not have
even brought Nora.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.522
She left us at that bar.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.149
I should have planned better.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.692
As your friend,
Frank was stolen.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.652
That is a fact.
That is not your fault.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.031
As your girlfriend,
I need you to take it easy
on Ivy, okay?

10:15.031 --> 10:19.285
She's her own worst critic
and holds herself
to an impossibly high bar.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.328
Thank you.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.579
Thank you for saying that.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.373
I just...
I can't accept it.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.292
I just... I screwed up.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.210
And now look at us, you know?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.087
We're in the swamp.

10:30.171 --> 10:34.300
It's so loamy,
and earthy and shiny.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.677
Picturesque, really.

10:36.761 --> 10:42.558
Oof! It's breathtaking, really.
Dare I say, ethereal.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.602
Whoa! Swamps are awesome.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.569
Hey, you two.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.946
Chai lattes?

10:56.030 --> 10:59.367
Mother...
Martha, you've hardly
touched your tuna.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.788
Oh!
Yes. Very funny.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.956
Master Wayne,
I hate to see you like this.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.666
I'm fine, Alfred.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.920
Soon I'll learn cat and be able
to communicate with my parents.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.797
I mean, my cats.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.597
Selina?

11:21.597 --> 11:23.599
What's going on?

11:30.606 --> 11:32.775
Ugh! Who drinks chai?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.777
I do. You know that.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.278
Hey, is Linda home?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.614
Uh, we got divorced.

11:38.614 --> 11:42.034
She said we weren't compatible,
and also everything about me
is disgusting.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.869
Mmm.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.455
Oh, my God!
Did you have sex with him?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.542
Alec and I connected
beyond the physical,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.293
But, yes, we fucked.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.129
Well, it's not every day
that a beautiful
and majestic creature

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
stumbles into
your home drunk at 4:00 a.m.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.593
Would anyone like more?
I'm just obsessed
with this stuff.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.763
- And the chai is not bad either.
-

12:02.847 --> 12:06.016
You need to freeze Swamp Thing
so we can force him
to find Frank.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.768
I don't know
if I can freeze a guy

12:07.852 --> 12:11.397
- who was inside of me less than 24 hours ago.
- Oh! Ew!

12:11.397 --> 12:14.483
Okay. TMI.
But he likes you, right?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.528
So just maybe, like,
ask him to help us.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.821
He'll listen to you

12:18.821 --> 12:22.825
given... the connection
you guys have.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.578
- You're right.
- Okay. Go.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.247
Oh, man. It's so goddamn
humid down here.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.623
My hair must look insane.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.041
It's beautiful.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.836
In an early '80s
power suit sort of way.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.671
Listen, I don't want
to force a conversation,

12:35.671 --> 12:37.590
but I understand
what you're going through.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.885
If you were missing,
I would be lost.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.678
Okay? And you
love him so much--

12:42.678 --> 12:45.097
Hey, babe, could you...
Seriously, like, I'm good.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.559
Like, you don't have to, like,
you know, sweetly check in
and all that stuff.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.643
I mean, we're good.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.520
- I... I promise.
- Great news.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.023
- We're going to get beignets.
- Oh, hell yeah!

12:54.023 --> 12:55.441
Wait. Why?

12:55.441 --> 12:58.235
Well, I went over there
and he's just so sexy,

12:58.319 --> 12:59.862
I got lost in his vines,

12:59.862 --> 13:02.490
and then I felt weird
about asking for
such a big thing,

13:02.490 --> 13:05.493
and then we had a quickie,
smoked a J,
and I was hungry,

13:05.493 --> 13:08.329
- so he suggested beignets!
- That was fast.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.832
-

13:11.916 --> 13:13.501
- Show yourself.
-

13:13.501 --> 13:15.252
Oh, my apologies.

13:15.336 --> 13:20.049
I'm a fan of the extravagant.
A little shock and awe.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.051
- What is this?
- Notebook.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.178
Comfy couch. Tissues.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.013
I'm a therapist.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.807
I'm here to help you
talk about your feelings
in this relationship.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.060
- Alfred.
- I'm fine.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.437
- Same.
- An emotionally unavailable duo.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.732
We could spend weeks
slowly getting each of you
to open up

13:36.732 --> 13:39.693
and come
to a greater understanding
about your relationship.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.571
Or,
I could make each of you

13:42.655 --> 13:45.574
sing those feelings right now.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.368
Neither.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.663
I'm not talking
about my feelings
and I'm definitely not singing.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.749

14:20.943 --> 14:24.947
It's a few Silicon Valley bros
kind of gentrifying the swamp.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.033
They got the recipe
from an algorithm
and charge $9 a beignet.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.577
I cannot wait.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.288

Ooh, ooh, two chocolate.

Yes, yum. Yum.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.833
Nora?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.627
Why didn't you just ask
Swamp Thing about Frank?

14:38.711 --> 14:39.962
It was awkward.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.130
I'm sorry.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.632
Oh, I'm so sorry
that asking you

14:43.716 --> 14:45.968
to make a small
and simple request

14:45.968 --> 14:48.429
of your boyfriend
was too awkward for you.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.973
Whoa!
He's not my boyfriend.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.391
I'm not?

14:52.391 --> 14:55.269
Well, I'm just not looking
for anything serious.

14:55.269 --> 14:59.398
- Also, we met nine hours ago.
- But we connected.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.942
I let you
inside of me, literally.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.902
I'm just having fun, Alec.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.504
The algorithm!

15:22.588 --> 15:25.424
I just wanted
one fucking beignet.

15:34.600 --> 15:39.188
Jesus Christ, Nora!
You couldn't just lie and say
he's your boyfriend?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.857
I can't tie myself down
right now.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.485
I'm in my sexual prime.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.572
This sucks.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.908
Swamp Thing is so sensitive.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.994
It's like Nora
doesn't want to date
his soft, country ass,

15:54.078 --> 15:55.704
so he destroys everything.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.248
As your girlfriend,
he's being totally
fucking annoying,

15:58.332 --> 15:59.792
and it fuckin' sucks.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.461
As a psychiatrist,
this is not healthy.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.215
But the swamp hurricane
is an expression
of his inner trauma.

16:09.093 --> 16:14.390
Huh, he clearly has a lot
of pent-up emotional baggage
that he needs to work through.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
He's a grown-ass plant man.

16:16.392 --> 16:21.146
He's having a temper tantrum,
and it's literally affecting
the ecosystem.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.408
Don't fight it.
Also, you can't.

Right. I'm... I'm fine.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.115
Do you
take insurance, or is this
a super bill situation?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.538
I'm too sensitive, huh?

18:47.668 --> 18:51.880
All I was trying to say
was that you could
chill out a little.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.300
No! You never let me
express myself, Ivy.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.511
This is why
we stopped being friends.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.888
Didn't
we stop being friends

18:59.972 --> 19:02.057
because I wanted
to destroy humanity?

19:02.057 --> 19:06.937
Sure, that wasn't the best,
but it was mostly that
you were a shitty friend.

19:06.937 --> 19:11.358
I would listen to you for hours
complaining about humans
being the worst

19:11.358 --> 19:14.528
and how you didn't understand
the appeal of those
bougie Lacoste polos.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.864
But if for a second,

19:16.864 --> 19:19.241
I tried to discuss
my impending divorce
with Linda,

19:19.241 --> 19:21.702
and how it was ripping
my heart apart,

19:21.702 --> 19:23.829
you would find
some excuse to leave.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.624
You have no idea
what it means to lose someone
important to you.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.252
You're so selfish.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.838
Oh, I don't know
what it feels like
to lose someone?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.256
The only reason
why I came down here

19:34.256 --> 19:36.091
is because
I lost my best friend.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.553
He's the only person
who understood me as me
before Harley.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.597
I'm so
worried about Frank,

19:41.597 --> 19:43.599
and I...
and I don't know where he is,

19:43.599 --> 19:45.475
and I can't find him
in the Green

19:45.559 --> 19:47.352
because I'm not strong enough.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.565
And every second
that I spend here,
he's slipping away from me.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.275
Maybe forever.

19:53.275 --> 19:57.571
And it's my fault
and I need to get him back
and I have to.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.908
Whoa!

20:02.784 --> 20:05.913
I have to get him and I can't.

20:08.123 --> 20:12.252
Thank you for letting me
into your heart.
It means so much.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.300
Is this me or you?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.885
Oh! Thank God, you're okay.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.221
Oh!

20:24.932 --> 20:26.016
Let's find Frank.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.854
I've really learned a lot
these last two days.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.981
You can barter coke
for almost anything,

20:33.065 --> 20:37.027
and maybe I don't have to live
the life I lost all at once.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.528
Oh, my goodness!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.948
Did you guys do this on purpose
to get me back on track?

20:40.948 --> 20:44.701
- Set up this whole thing with Ivy in New Orleans and Fred?
- Frank.

20:44.785 --> 20:48.413
- It's Frank. But sure, yeah.
- You guys.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.167
You're a real badass,
you know that?

20:52.167 --> 20:53.961
How so?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.380
Uh, I saw you out there
going to battle with
your inner demons.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.341
Obviously, I tried to drop
some bread crumbs
along the way,

20:59.341 --> 21:01.218
but you got there on your own.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.304
That is boss lady shit.
Matches your big hair.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.807
Oh, wow! That's too...
That is...

21:06.807 --> 21:10.811
Thanks for...
Thanks for putting up
with my stubbornness,

21:10.811 --> 21:12.062
and my hair.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.106
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.024
Aw! Anytime, dolly.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.570
Beignets! How...

21:20.654 --> 21:22.739
Oh, my God, I love you so much.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.575
So, seriously,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.077
like, do you think
that you can...

21:27.077 --> 21:28.745
You can help me use
the Green to find Frank?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.163
I don't need to help you.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.790
The only thing stopping you
was your fears.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.042
When you open your heart
and your mind completely

21:34.126 --> 21:36.586
you can always
access the Green.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.338
You're ready.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.091
Oh, shit! I hate it
when the power was
inside me all along.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.050
You got this.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.602
Let me out!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.604
Why the hell am I here?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.737
So, what did you see?

22:03.363 --> 22:04.906
Master Bruce,
are you all right?

22:04.990 --> 22:05.991
I'm fine.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.534
I don't need Selina.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.952
I'm not looking for love.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.496
I just want to focus
on my career right now.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.582
Poison Ivy
did something to him.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.417
And I'm going
to figure out what.
