01:45.506 --> 01:48.309
DON'T YOU
WANT TO SEE MINE?

01:48.409 --> 01:50.578
YEAH, RIGHT,

01:50.678 --> 01:53.914
OF COURSE.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.384
YOU LOOK NERVOUS,
FRIEND.

01:56.484 --> 02:00.488

02:09.497 --> 02:10.698
HERE.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.569
PERFECT.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.171
VERY REALISTIC.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.772
IT ALWAYS IS.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.908
MY SPECIALTY.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.919
(LIGHTER FLICKS)

02:44.298 --> 02:46.934
(TICKING)

03:01.048 --> 03:03.517
THAT'LL WARM YOU UP.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.923
* TRA-LA LA

03:10.023 --> 03:11.625

03:11.725 --> 03:15.329

03:15.429 --> 03:18.332

03:18.432 --> 03:21.235

03:21.335 --> 03:23.337
* TRA-LA LA

03:23.437 --> 03:24.938
* TWITTLE-DEE DEE DEE

03:25.038 --> 03:28.242
* THERE'S PEACE AND GOOD WILL

03:28.342 --> 03:29.843
* YOU'RE WELCOME

03:29.943 --> 03:31.812
* AS THE FLOWERS

03:31.912 --> 03:34.948
* ON MOCKINGBIRD HILL

03:35.048 --> 03:38.352
* WHEN THE SUN IN THE MORNIN'

03:38.452 --> 03:41.655
* PEEPS OVER THE HILL

03:41.755 --> 03:45.359

03:45.459 --> 03:48.262
* ROUND MY WINDOW SILL

03:48.362 --> 03:49.463

03:51.765 --> 03:53.867
* WHEN I HEAR THE TRILL

Woman:
BREAKFAST, EVERYBODY!

04:04.478 --> 04:05.713
MORNING, SWEETHEART.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.148
DID THAT EXPLOSION
WAKE YOU UP LAST NIGHT?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.149
EXPLOSION? NO.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.418
BUT THE SIRENS
WOKE ME UP.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.420
I WAS HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING, ANYHOW,

04:12.520 --> 04:15.022
SO AROUND 4:00,
I THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN

04:15.122 --> 04:16.357
AND BAKE THE BREAD
FOR THE WEEK,

04:16.457 --> 04:19.059
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
GEE, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

04:19.159 --> 04:20.793
IF WE COULD ALL HAVE A NICE

04:20.894 --> 04:22.296
FAMILY BREAKFAST FOR ONCE,

04:22.396 --> 04:24.698
SO I DID THE DISHES
AND I MADE BREAKFAST.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.501
OH, AND, NORMAN,
I'D HAVE FIXED THE BATHROOM,

04:27.601 --> 04:30.037
BUT I WAS AFRAID
I'D MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.372
NO. THAT'S
ON MY LIST.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.441
NORMAN,
THAT IS YOUR LIST.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.076
THEN IT'S ON IT.
IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.378
COME ON DOWN, KIDS.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.880
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A NICE FAMILY BREAKFAST.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.049
COME ON, CINDY,
HURRY UP.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.817
Cindy: I GOT
4 MORE MINUTES.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.985
CHECK THE SCHEDULE.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.055
YOU'RE NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING
IN THERE, ARE YOU?

04:48.155 --> 04:50.691
WELL, IT'S THE PRINCIPLE
OF THE THING.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.459
OH, MAN.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.193
A HIGH-SPEED
POLICE CHASE

04:53.293 --> 04:55.396
ERUPTED LAST NIGHT
ON THE INTERSTATE,

04:55.496 --> 04:57.398
ENDING IN SUBURBAN
PLEASANT VALLEY.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.500
OVER A DOZEN
HIGHWAY PATROL CARS

04:59.600 --> 05:00.934
JOINED THE METRO DIVISION

05:01.034 --> 05:02.803
AT SPEEDS SOMETIMES EXCEEDING
120 MILES PER HOUR...

05:02.903 --> 05:05.105
Norman: THE VALLEY ISN'T
SAFE ANYMORE, HONEY.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.340
UH-HUH.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.808
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
I BOUGHT A GUN.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.443
RIGHT. THAT'S JUST WHAT
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS--

05:09.543 --> 05:11.178
YOU WITH A GUN.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.480
COME ON DOWN, KIDS!

05:12.580 --> 05:15.015
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A NICE FAMILY BREAKFAST.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.318
THANKS, DAD.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.853
HOLD IT.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
WHAT'S THIS?

05:23.256 --> 05:24.692
A PACK
OF CIGARETTES.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.694
I KNOW THAT.
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW

05:26.794 --> 05:29.397
IS WHAT WERE THEY DOING
IN YOUR COAT POCKET?

05:29.497 --> 05:30.998
ARE YOU SMOKING?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.933
SO WHAT IF I AM?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.435
"SO WHAT IF I AM?"

05:34.535 --> 05:36.370
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SMOKING DOES?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.039
IT STUNTS YOUR GROWTH,
IT YELLOWS YOUR TEETH,

05:39.139 --> 05:41.008
AND IT BLACKENS
YOUR LUNGS.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.443
IS THAT YOU WANT,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.445
TO BE A YELLOW-TOOTHED
MIDGET WITH LUNG CANCER?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.447
WELL, I LIKE TO KEEP
MY OPTIONS OPEN.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.983
HEY, KEV, I'VE GOT
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.654
OW, DAD.
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.890
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CATCH IT, SON.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.061
ARE YOU GOING
TO WEAR THAT

06:01.161 --> 06:02.496
TO SCHOOL AGAIN,
BILLY?

06:02.596 --> 06:04.598
YES, MY FATHER.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.635
BABE, YOU NOTICE
SOMETHING FUNNY

06:07.735 --> 06:09.336
AROUND THE HOUSE LATELY?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.672
COME ON, BILLY.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE AGAIN.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.674
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'S
FALLING APART

06:13.774 --> 06:16.009
AND NOBODY
LIKES EACH OTHER.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.678
LOOK, NORMAN,
THIS MAY NOT BE

06:17.778 --> 06:19.413
THE PERFECT FAMILY,
BUT IT'S CLOSE.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.048
IT'S FILLED WITH
A LOT OF AFFECTION.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.249
I SHOULD KNOW.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.151
I COOK THE MEALS,
I RUN THE HOUSE,

06:24.251 --> 06:25.486
DO YOU
EVER HEAR ME COMPLAIN?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.821
NO. THAT'S BECAUSE
I LOVE BEING A HOMEMAKER.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.191
I FIND IT FULFILLING
AND REWARDING,

06:31.291 --> 06:33.193
AND NOTHING'S
FALLING APART,

06:33.293 --> 06:35.195
AND EVERYBODY
LOVES ONE ANOTHER,

06:35.295 --> 06:37.698
SO GET OFF MY BACK!

06:39.567 --> 06:42.803
EVERYTHING'S FINE!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.505
(HISSING)

06:44.605 --> 06:45.706

06:45.806 --> 06:47.708

06:49.577 --> 06:51.479
SHE'LL BE BACK, SON.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.414
(TIRES SQUEAL)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.450
(SQUEAL)

06:56.550 --> 06:58.919
Norman: THERE WE ARE.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.824
A LITTLE NUTTY THIS MORNING.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.425
(SQUEAL)

07:05.526 --> 07:08.261
JUST WANTED A LITTLE
BACK-UP PRACTICE.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.697
IN YOU GO.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.099
GET IN THE CAR,
BILLY.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.034
CAN THIS BE A HEARSE?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.937
GET IN THE HEARSE,
BILLY.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.108
BUCKLE UP.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.085

07:42.896 --> 07:44.865
NORMAN,
WE GOT ONE FOR YOU.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.901
HOW DID THE BIRD SAY "BARETTA"
WHEN HE WAS TIED UP--

07:48.001 --> 07:49.503
BY PECKING OUT THE NUMBER
OF THE POLICE STATION

07:49.603 --> 07:50.571
ON THE TELEPHONE

07:50.671 --> 07:51.739
WHEN BARETTA
WAS HELD HOSTAGE,

07:51.839 --> 07:53.240
EPISODE 23,
"A WING AND A PRAYER."

07:53.340 --> 07:54.374
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.676
(BELL RINGING)

07:55.776 --> 07:59.079
HOW'S HE KNOW
ALL THOSE SHOWS?

08:01.214 --> 08:02.550
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S SILLY

08:02.650 --> 08:04.417
WASTING YOUR TIME ON
THESE COP SHOWS?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.453
WHY DON'T YOU GET ON SOMETHING
THAT MATTERS,

08:06.554 --> 08:07.821
LIKE BASEBALL?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.823
SILLY? PHIL, SOMEWHERE
IN THE WORLD,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.358
EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY,

08:11.458 --> 08:13.393
THERE'S AN EPISODE
OF KOJAK BEING RERUN.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.128
CAN YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT BASEBALL?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.363
NOT DURING
THE OFF-SEASON.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.498
FOR KOJAK, THERE
IS NO OFF-SEASON.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.901
(JAZZ PLAYING)

08:28.508 --> 08:31.845
OH, UH, I'D LIKE A BAGEL
WITH NO CREAM CHEESE

08:31.945 --> 08:34.881
AND A LITTLE BUTTER

08:34.982 --> 08:35.883
THANK YOU.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.620
(SIREN)

08:53.967 --> 08:57.070
I SAID NO CREAM CHEESE.
EXCUSE ME.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.876
PLEASE. I'M A GOOD COP.
I SHOW UP ON TIME.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.278
I FILL IN
MY REPORTS TO THE T.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.512
(SECOND MAN
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

09:39.613 --> 09:41.514
THAT'S WHY YOU AND JAKE
TEAM SO WELL.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.650
JAKE CAN'T
SPELL ANYTHING.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.651
CAPTAIN, PLEASE.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.118
I'M BEGGING YOU HERE.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.253
MY COPS SHOULDN'T BEG.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.621
DON'T BEG.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.623
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ELSE TO SAY THIS.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.524
I WANT A NEW PARTNER.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.694
YOU WANT A NEW PARTNER?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.028
I THINK
JAKE WOULD BE HAPPIER

09:55.128 --> 09:56.764
IF YOU TEAMED HIM UP
WITH SOMEBODY

09:56.864 --> 09:58.598
A LITTLE MORE...
LIKE HIM.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.503
WELL, WHERE AM I GOING TO
FIND SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

10:03.603 --> 10:04.938
I'VE KNOWN JAKE
FOR 30 YEARS.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.274
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME...

10:07.374 --> 10:09.977
LOOK, CAPTAIN, PLEASE,

10:10.077 --> 10:12.646
I AM BEGGING YOU
NOT TO DO THIS TO ME.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.415
HEY, HEY, HEY.
YOU'RE A GOOD TEAM.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.284
YOU'RE A GOOD TEAM.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.686
CAPTAIN, HE HATES ME.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.021
OF COURSE HE HATES YOU.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.290
HE HATES ME.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.358
HE HATES EVERYBODY.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.229
HEY, JAKE, DON'T YOU
HATE EVERYBODY?

10:31.164 --> 10:34.501
THERE. NOW,
DON'T WE ALL FEEL BETTER?

10:34.601 --> 10:37.037
GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.571
OSBORN.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.807
HE'S THE NEW MIDDLEMAN

10:39.907 --> 10:41.308
IN A COUNTERFEITING
OPERATION.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.177
SEEMS HE'S FOUND A WAY OF
ELIMINATING THE COMPETITION.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.345
HOW?

10:45.445 --> 10:46.546
BY ELIMINATING
THE COMPETITION.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.981
NOW, HE'S RENTED A HOME

10:48.081 --> 10:50.583
UNDER THE ALIAS
JOHN HENDERSON

10:50.684 --> 10:53.153
OUT IN PLEASANT VALLEY.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.254
PLEASANT VALLEY?

10:54.354 --> 10:55.355
I GUESS HE FIGURED

10:55.455 --> 10:57.657
THAT WAS AS FAR
AS WE'D LOOK.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.892
I WANT YOU AND TONY

10:58.992 --> 11:01.028
TO POST A STAKEOUT
NEXT DOOR.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.496
I DON'T GET IT.
IF WE KNOW WHERE HE IS,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.632
WHY DON'T WE GO
IN THERE AND GRAB HIM?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.801
YOU GOT A LOT OF
YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM, TONY.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.903
GOD, I HATE THAT.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.905
WE DON'T JUST GO IN
AND GRAB OSBORN.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.574
WE WANT HIM TO LEAD US
TO SOMEBODY BIG--

11:14.674 --> 11:15.943
FREDERICK LUTZ.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.212
HE'S PICKING UP
A BIG BUNDLE OF PHONY 50s

11:19.312 --> 11:20.748
FROM OSBORN THIS WEEK.

11:20.848 --> 11:25.719
LUTZ? I THOUGHT
HE ORDERED--

11:25.819 --> 11:28.221
I THOUGHT HE ORDERED
A HIT ON OSBORN HIMSELF.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.992
I GUESS THEY KISSED
AND MADE UP, HUH?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.927
THE DEAL WILL GO DOWN
IN THE HOUSE,

11:34.027 --> 11:35.963
SO DON'T MAKE A MOVE
UNTIL LUTZ SHOWS.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.631
HEY, JAKE, THIS HOUSE
WE'RE STAYING IN,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.968
WHO LIVES THERE?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.235
WHO CARES?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.671
Norman: HI. I'VE
MENTIONED THIS BEFORE,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.239
BUT VOLUME 8
OF POLICE WOMAN

11:46.339 --> 11:48.942
IS MISSING 11 SECONDS
OFF ITS END CREDITS.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.610
ANYBODY ELSE
COMPLAINED ABOUT IT?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.780
NO ONE ELSE
HAS EVER RENTED IT.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.115
IT'S AMERICAN
HISTORY.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.416
NORMAN ROBBERSON?

11:56.516 --> 11:57.417
UH-HUH.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.087

12:00.187 --> 12:02.122
WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU, MR. ROBBERSON.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.125
WHAT, DID I FORGET
TO REWIND MY TAPES?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.127
Tony: JUST COME
WITH US, PLEASE.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.029
IS THAT IT?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.765
JEEZ, YOU GUYS
ARE STRICT.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.408
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.542
WHAT'S TO KNOW?

12:22.642 --> 12:23.811
MR. ROBBERSON,

12:23.911 --> 12:25.545
YOU'RE NEXT DOOR TO
A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.047
YOUR HOME IS
THE PERFECT COVER

12:27.147 --> 12:30.317
FOR AN EFFECTIVE
STAKEOUT, MR. ROBBERSON.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.922
LOOK, UH...MY FAMILY'S
KIND OF GOING THROUGH

12:35.022 --> 12:36.924
A DIFFICULT TIME
RIGHT NOW.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.692
I DON'T KNOW IF BRINGING
COPS AND COUNTERFEITERS

12:39.793 --> 12:40.928
INTO THE HOUSE

12:41.028 --> 12:43.230
IS EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.666
THE RIGHT THING?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.936
HUH.

12:49.036 --> 12:52.372
WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING,
MR. ROBBERSON?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.344
COVER YOUR ASS.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.981
FORGET ABOUT THE COMFORT
OF THE WIFE, KIDDIES

13:01.081 --> 13:02.282
THE RIGHT THING...

13:02.382 --> 13:05.218
WE'RE ALL JUST...

13:05.318 --> 13:09.890
ONE INCH AWAY FROM
A LAWLESS SOCIETY...

13:09.990 --> 13:13.560
AND YOU KNOW WHAT KEEPS
THAT NIGHTMARE AWAY?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.129
MEN...

13:16.229 --> 13:18.932
LONE MEN,

13:19.032 --> 13:20.968
MEN WITH THE COURAGE

13:21.068 --> 13:25.438
TO STAND UP TO THE NIGHT
AND SPIT IN ITS EYE.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.982
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
ROBBERSON?

13:35.082 --> 13:39.186
YOU GOT THE GUTS
TO BE ONE OF THOSE MEN?

13:40.387 --> 13:42.322
WOW.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.258
Jack: WHAT DID YOU
TELL YOUR WIFE?

13:45.358 --> 13:48.195
MY WIFE. YES, UH,
HELEN, YES, WELL,

13:48.295 --> 13:50.964
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE
TOLD HER IN THE MORNING.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.266
TOMORROW? WE'RE
MOVING IN TONIGHT.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.735
I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND THAT'S JUST FINE.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.872
IT'S JUST THAT I THINK HELEN
WOULD BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THIS

13:58.972 --> 14:01.541
IN THE CLEAR LIGHT
OF DAY.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.410
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S MY PROBLEM.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.079
I'LL HANDLE IT FIRST
THING IN THE MORNING.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.814
THAT'S OSBORN'S
HOUSE ON THE LEFT.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.516
YOU GUYS BETTER DUCK.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.520
DON'T LET HIM SEE US.

ENTRYWAY.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.428
WONDERFUL.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.536
Norman: THE GARAGE DOOR
IS STUCK.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.038
SO, WHAT'S THE PROCEDURE

14:31.138 --> 14:32.605
IF THE GARAGE
ENTRYWAY IS--

14:32.705 --> 14:34.942
GET US INTO THE HOUSE.
COME ON.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.209

15:50.917 --> 15:54.187

16:06.499 --> 16:08.868
Helen: NORMAN?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.403
(WHISPERING)
It's my wife.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.704
SO WHAT?

16:11.804 --> 16:12.939
I KNOW MY WIFE.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.974
LET ME BREAK THIS
TO HER IN MY OWN WAY.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.334
NORMAN, WAS THAT
OUR CAR ALARM?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.103
NO.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.905
IT SOUNDED LIKE
OUR CAR ALARM.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.675

16:57.950 --> 17:00.053
There's a noise

THE, UH, THE CAT.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.325

17:05.425 --> 17:07.760
What's the cat
doing in the closet?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.698
WHO KNOWS? COULD BE
DOING ANYTHING IN THERE.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.898
THE DOOR'S CLOSED.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.102
NORMAN, LET THE CAT
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.836
I CAN'T DO THAT.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.570
WHY NOT?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.339
BECAUSE I'M TRAINING HER.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.576
SHE WAS A BAD CAT,
AND I'M DISCIPLINING HER.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.844
BAD CAT.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.613

YOU CAN SEE THE HOUSE

18:35.748 --> 18:38.518

ARE WE STARTING NOW?
IS THIS ALL PART OF IT?

18:44.857 --> 18:46.893
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.631

41:36.528 --> 41:37.763
Norman: WELL,
HELEN'S GONE,

41:37.863 --> 41:39.665
AND I'M SURE THE KIDS
ARE ALREADY IN SCHOOL.

41:39.765 --> 41:42.300
Osborn: THEN WHO WAS THAT
I SAW IN THE WINDOW?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.535
Norman: WHAT?

41:43.635 --> 41:46.304
WHEN WE WERE
IN MY BEDROOM,

41:46.404 --> 41:49.074
I SAW SOMEONE
IN THE WINDOW.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.710
OH...

41:51.810 --> 41:53.044
HIM.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.613
THAT WAS MY BROTHER.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.482
Osborn: YOUR BROTHER.

41:57.583 --> 41:58.984
Norman: MM-HMM, YEAH.

41:59.084 --> 42:02.654
HE'S VISITING FROM BOS...
UH, BUFFALO.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.091
YOU WANT TO MEET HIM?

42:06.191 --> 42:08.159
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.261
JAKE, COME ON DOWN.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.197
COME ON, DON'T BE SHY.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.999
COME DOWN
AND MEET MY NEIGHBOR.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.534
HE LIVES NEXT DOOR,
COINCIDENTALLY.

42:16.635 --> 42:19.170
JAKE? COME ON DOWN.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.451
WELL, THIS IS
MY OLDER BROTHER JAKE.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.854
HI. I'M HIS
OLDER BROTHER JAKE.

42:35.954 --> 42:38.256
I'M VISITING
FROM BUFFALO.

42:38.356 --> 42:40.859
VISITING FROM BUFFALO.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.861
MM.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.699
BUFFALO, NEW YORK.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.769
OH.

42:50.869 --> 42:53.571
THAT BUFFALO. YEAH.

42:57.008 --> 42:57.909
(SQUEAK)

42:58.009 --> 42:59.110
(CRASH)

42:59.210 --> 43:01.680
WHAT WAS THAT?

43:03.615 --> 43:05.350
OH, THAT'S NOBODY, REALLY.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.418
THERE'S SOMEBODY
ELSE UP THERE.

43:07.518 --> 43:08.920
NO, THAT'S JUST, UH, TONY.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.691
TONY, YOU WANT TO COME DOWN
AND MEET MY NEIGHBOR?

43:14.159 --> 43:15.360
HI.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.636
TONY'S...

43:24.736 --> 43:27.472
TONY'S...
WELL, TONY'S...

43:27.572 --> 43:29.007
Cindy: MY BOYFRIEND.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.842
CINDY'S BOYFRIEND.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.347
WELL, WE BETTER
GET GOING.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.416
WE'RE ALREADY
LATE FOR SCHOOL.

43:38.516 --> 43:40.185
YEAH. RIGHT.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.687
SCHOOL.

43:41.787 --> 43:44.055
GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. ROBBERSON.

43:44.155 --> 43:46.091
NICE SEEING YOU, TONY.
COME BACK AGAIN.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.026
Tony: OH, SURE.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.327
LET'S GO. UH...

43:49.427 --> 43:52.030
WE DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.965
BYE, UNCLE JAKE.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.901
BYE.

43:56.001 --> 43:57.168
OH.

43:57.268 --> 43:58.303
BYE...

43:58.403 --> 44:00.071
NIECE.

44:00.171 --> 44:02.640
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY DAUGHTER, TONY.

44:02.741 --> 44:04.676
Tony: RIGHT.

44:11.917 --> 44:14.652
YOU GOT A PRETTY FULL
HOUSE THIS WEEK.

44:14.753 --> 44:17.155
MAYBE I'LL GET
THE GRAND TOUR...

44:17.255 --> 44:18.156
UH!

44:18.256 --> 44:19.590
ANOTHER DAY.

44:19.691 --> 44:22.160
SURE THING.
DROP BY AGAIN.

44:22.260 --> 44:24.662
MR. HENDERSON.

44:26.297 --> 44:27.432
UM...

44:27.532 --> 44:30.068
MY BROTHER DIDN'T
BOTHER YOU, DID HE?

44:30.168 --> 44:31.469
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

44:31.569 --> 44:33.004
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.906
BEING NOSY,
SNOOPING AROUND,

44:35.006 --> 44:38.176
ACTING LIKE A...
LIKE A MORON.

44:40.145 --> 44:41.379
WELL...

44:41.479 --> 44:43.281
A LITTLE.

44:43.381 --> 44:44.750
YEAH, WELL...

44:44.850 --> 44:46.584
HE'S HAVING TROUBLE
ACCLIMATING.

44:46.684 --> 44:50.255
YOU KNOW, HE'S ONLY BEEN OUT
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

44:52.824 --> 44:54.425
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OUT?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.862
OUT OF THE SANITARIUM.

44:56.962 --> 45:00.031
YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE THE SCARS?

45:00.131 --> 45:02.100
NO.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.135
NO. COME ON.

45:04.235 --> 45:08.273
I GUESS HIS HAIR HAS...
GROWN BACK IN.

45:09.674 --> 45:11.242
YOU MEAN THEY--THEY...

45:11.342 --> 45:12.978
YEAH.

45:16.748 --> 45:18.784
AT LEAST HE'S...

45:18.884 --> 45:21.086
HE'S HARMLESS NOW.

45:23.488 --> 45:25.056
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.959
HE GOES TO WORK
EVERY DAY.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.227
WORK?

45:29.327 --> 45:30.661
(CHUCKLES)

45:30.762 --> 45:34.299
WELL, HE DRIVES DOWNTOWN,
SITS ON A PARK BENCH,

45:34.399 --> 45:37.302
AND DROOLS FOR 8 HOURS.

45:39.104 --> 45:40.105
WELL...

45:40.205 --> 45:43.274
OH, IF HE GIVES YOU
ANY MORE TROUBLE,

45:43.374 --> 45:46.111
YOU CALL ME, HUH?

45:47.512 --> 45:49.214
THAT'S REALLY SAD.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.582
LIFE IS...

45:51.682 --> 45:53.284
(SIGH)

45:53.384 --> 45:55.086
SAD.

45:57.555 --> 45:58.623
(DOOR CLOSES)

45:58.723 --> 46:00.491
POOR GUY DROOLS.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.460
YOUR BROTHER?

46:02.560 --> 46:05.630
WELL, YOU SAID I HAD
A LOBOTOMY.

46:05.730 --> 46:08.466
THAT'S BETTER THAN
BEING YOUR BROTHER.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.705
SO WHY DID YOU
DO THAT?

46:14.806 --> 46:16.207
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.243
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
WERE DYING IN THERE.

46:18.343 --> 46:20.478
WELL, THAT WAS GOOD,
YOU KNOW THAT?

46:20.578 --> 46:21.913
THAT WAS
REALLY GOOD.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.882
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.683
WELL, IT'S JUST...

46:25.783 --> 46:27.085
NONE OF THE GIRLS
I KNOW

46:27.185 --> 46:28.686
WOULD HAVE
BEEN THAT SMART.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.456
YEAH, WELL,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

46:32.858 --> 46:35.994
(WHISTLING)

46:36.094 --> 46:37.528
Jake: NOW, THERE
ARE CERTAIN THINGS

46:37.628 --> 46:39.564
THAT WE AS, UH...

46:39.664 --> 46:42.133
I'M SORRY.
JAKE, IT'S HOT.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.469
Jake: AS LAW-ENFORCING
PROFESSIONALS

46:44.569 --> 46:45.904
MAY HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED

46:46.004 --> 46:47.939
THAT YOU LAY PEOPLE

46:48.039 --> 46:51.209
MAYBE DIDN'T
QUITE UNDERSTAND.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.710
FOR EXAMPLE,

46:52.810 --> 46:55.546
WHEN STAKING OUT
A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL...

46:55.646 --> 46:56.948
THANK YOU.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.184
IT IS GENERALLY
A GOOD IDEA

46:59.284 --> 47:02.453
TO STAY OUT
OF HIS DAMNED HOUSE.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.990
BOY, TALK ABOUT
BEATING A DEAD HORSE.

47:05.090 --> 47:07.358
YES, AND THERE WAS
NO REAL HARM DONE.

47:07.458 --> 47:08.693
NO HARM DONE?

47:08.793 --> 47:10.929
BUT THEY'VE SEEN US.

47:11.029 --> 47:13.564
YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.567
NOW THAT OSBORN THINKS
WE'RE PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD,

47:16.667 --> 47:17.635
WE CAN'T BE RELIEVED.

47:17.735 --> 47:19.070
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.773
SO I AM STUCK HERE
ON A 24-HOUR BASIS

47:22.874 --> 47:24.575
PLAYING THE ROLE OF...

47:24.675 --> 47:27.212
THE UNCLE FROM BUFFALO.

47:29.780 --> 47:32.250
I'M SORRY YOUR PLANS
HAVE CHANGED, JAKE,

47:32.350 --> 47:34.419
BUT WE'RE SO HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.454
TONIGHT I'VE MADE
YOUR FAVORITE DINNER--

47:36.554 --> 47:37.722
KUNG PAO PORK.

47:37.822 --> 47:40.025
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE A DINNER PARTY.

47:40.125 --> 47:42.260
WHAT JAKE MEANS IS WE HAVE
AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT,

47:42.360 --> 47:44.095
SO WE CAN
GRAB SOME BURGER KING--

47:44.195 --> 47:46.898
NOT WHILE YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE.
GIVE ME YOUR PLATE.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.900
THANKS. AT LEAST
LET ME HELP OUT.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.036
I COULD DO THE DISHES
OR SOME LAUNDRY.

47:51.136 --> 47:53.304
JAKE WOULD BE HAPPY
TO MOW THE LAWN.

47:53.404 --> 47:54.739
OH, THANKS,
JAKE.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.107
WAIT A MINUTE.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.375
WAIT A COTTON-PICKING
MINUTE.

47:57.475 --> 47:59.444
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS
FROM YOU.

47:59.544 --> 48:00.912
I WASN'T
GIVING YOU ORDERS.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.447
Helen: JAKE'S RIGHT.

48:02.547 --> 48:05.050
HE'S A PROUD MAN, AND YOU PUT
HIM IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.

48:05.150 --> 48:07.252
EVEN IF HE WANTED
TO MOW THE LAWN,

48:07.352 --> 48:09.187
IT'S GOING TO SEEM
LIKE HE'S DOING IT

48:09.287 --> 48:11.122
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM TO.
HERE'S YOUR TEA.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.490
I'M SORRY.
LET'S EAT.

48:12.590 --> 48:13.891
OOPS. GET THE CREAM.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.460
PASS THE PETITS FOURS.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.794
BILLY, DON'T HAVE ONE

48:16.894 --> 48:18.596
UNTIL YOU FINISH
YOUR SANDWICH.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.299
Jake:
MRS. ROBBERSON...

48:21.399 --> 48:23.834
LISTEN TO ME.

48:23.935 --> 48:25.636
I DON'T MOW LAWNS.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.905
I NEVER MOWED LAWNS.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.108
I NEVER HAD A LAWN.

48:30.208 --> 48:33.211
AND IF I HAD A LAWN...

48:33.311 --> 48:35.013
I'D KILL IT.

48:35.113 --> 48:37.182
(LAWN MOWER RUNNING)

48:37.282 --> 48:39.150
OH!

48:40.851 --> 48:44.089
( GRUMBLING )

48:45.923 --> 48:48.326
Jake: GOD DAMN BASTARD!

48:55.833 --> 48:57.568
Jake: YOU DIRTY...

49:02.807 --> 49:06.377
SON OF A...
SON OF A BITCH!

49:06.477 --> 49:07.745
JAKE.

49:07.845 --> 49:08.879
YEAH, WHAT?!

49:08.980 --> 49:11.549
DO YOU HAVE TO USE
THAT LANGUAGE?

49:11.649 --> 49:13.651
WHAT LANGUAGE?

49:13.751 --> 49:15.153
WELL...

49:15.253 --> 49:17.055
IT'S NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE.

49:17.155 --> 49:20.758
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
IT'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE?

49:20.858 --> 49:22.660
IT'S NOT.

49:28.633 --> 49:29.734
THERE...

49:29.834 --> 49:32.137
11 SINGLE-SPACED
TYPED PAGES

49:32.237 --> 49:35.140
STATING THAT OSBORN HAS A ROOM
FULL OF LAWN FURNITURE

49:35.240 --> 49:37.142
AND HAS ORDERED
12 MATTRESSES.

49:37.242 --> 49:38.909
WE'RE GETTING
NOWHERE, JAKE.

49:39.010 --> 49:40.778
WE'LL GET THERE.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.247
HEY, IT'S FUNNY.

49:42.347 --> 49:45.483
THE ONLY REASON WE KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT OSBORN AS WE DO

49:45.583 --> 49:46.784
IS BECAUSE OF ROBBERSON.

49:46.884 --> 49:47.852
YEAH.

49:47.952 --> 49:49.687
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

49:51.289 --> 49:54.459
DOESN'T THIS KID
EVER GO OUT TO PLAY?

49:54.559 --> 49:55.793
LISTEN.

49:55.893 --> 49:58.263
SON, LISTEN.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.368
YOU'RE GETTING
SPOOKED, JAKE.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.370
ARRGGH!

50:07.072 --> 50:09.207
GET AWAY, KID.
GO ON!

50:09.307 --> 50:10.775
ARGGH!

50:10.875 --> 50:13.078
JAKE, I'M SORRY
MY SON JUMPED ON YOU

50:13.178 --> 50:14.312
AND BIT YOUR NECK

50:14.412 --> 50:16.547
AND TRIED TO SUCK
YOUR BLOOD.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.216
IT HAPPENS.

50:18.316 --> 50:20.918
BILLY, YOU CAN'T
BEHAVE LIKE THAT.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.953
IT'S NOT POLITE.

50:23.054 --> 50:24.189
(HISSING)

50:24.289 --> 50:26.724
NORMAN,
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?

50:26.824 --> 50:27.892
BILLY...

50:27.992 --> 50:31.062
THE VAMPIRE GAME
WAS FUN FOR A WHILE,

50:31.162 --> 50:34.099
AND NOW WE'RE LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD AROUND THE HOUSE,

50:34.199 --> 50:37.568
AND I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD TRY A NEW GAME.

50:37.668 --> 50:39.770
(HISSING)

50:42.173 --> 50:44.142
(BILLY GROWLS)

50:44.942 --> 50:46.211
(DOOR CLOSES)

50:46.311 --> 50:48.479
HE WON'T LISTEN
TO ME.

50:54.285 --> 50:58.156
HEY, KID, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

51:07.698 --> 51:09.534
HOW'S IT GOING?

51:13.238 --> 51:16.541
MY SON THINKS
HE'S A VAMPIRE.

51:16.641 --> 51:19.177
NO SHIT.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.780
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.749
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
HERE A FEW DAYS,

51:24.849 --> 51:28.253
AND ALREADY
THEY LISTEN TO YOU.

51:28.353 --> 51:30.888
THEY RESPECT YOU.

51:30.988 --> 51:32.690
WHAT TIME IS IT?

51:32.790 --> 51:35.760
QUARTER TO 3:00.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.027
(SIGH)

51:37.128 --> 51:39.063
QUARTER TO 3:00.

51:39.164 --> 51:41.065
NO ONE IN THE PLACE.

51:41.166 --> 51:43.201
HMM, HMM, HMM, HMM.

51:44.435 --> 51:47.238
* IT'S QUARTER
TO 3:00 *

51:47.338 --> 51:50.107
* THERE'S NO ONE

* WE'RE DRINKING,
MY FRIEND *

52:00.084 --> 52:03.254
* TO THE END

52:03.354 --> 52:06.123
* OF A BRIEF EPISODE

52:06.224 --> 52:10.528
* MAKE IT ONE
FOR MY BABY *

52:10.628 --> 52:17.001

FOR THE ROAD *

52:17.101 --> 52:18.102
* A LONG

52:18.203 --> 52:19.036
