WEBVTT

00:05.714 --> 00:08.341
-Hey, here's to you guys.
-Ooh.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.511
Tomorrow, you will be American citizens.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.180
This is my last night
with a bunch of foreigners at my table.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.850
-[laughter]
-Yep, finally ready to renounce

00:16.933 --> 00:18.893
free health care, economic prosperity,

00:18.977 --> 00:21.312
and diplomatic respect for...

00:21.396 --> 00:23.565
Oh, God,
maybe I didn't think this through.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.571
And tomorrow I will be as American
as El Pollo Loco.  Salud.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.281
[all]  Salud.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.075
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You can't drink.
You have a test tomorrow.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.746
Ay,  please. In Cuba, we had the four "R"s.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.124
Reading, writing, 'rithmetic and rum.

00:42.459 --> 00:46.045
Plus you only need to get
60% right to pass.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.881
So basically, to become an American,

00:47.964 --> 00:49.841
you have to prove
you're a D-minus student.

00:49.924 --> 00:53.011
Yep, it's the same requirement
as it is to become president.

00:57.849 --> 00:58.975
Want me to help you clean up?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.270
Nah, you're gonna be an American.
Let the Latinos do it.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.900
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[Elena] That's weird.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.151
[Alex] What's wrong?

01:09.110 --> 01:10.612
Syd just sent me a text.

01:10.695 --> 01:14.491
It's the dancing girl, salmon sushi
and prayer hands.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.658
Okay, don't panic.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.119
Why would I panic? Now I'm panicking.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.704
Relax.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.206
When you get confusing emojis,

01:21.289 --> 01:24.667
you just need to send even more confusing
emojis back until someone breaks.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.046
You're in an intense game
of emoji chicken.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.591
-So should I send Syd a chicken?
-Girl, are you cray?

01:32.342 --> 01:37.097
Okay, how about a ghost, a ski lift,

01:37.472 --> 01:40.934
and the Swedish flag? No, the Swiss flag.

01:45.688 --> 01:46.731
But what does that mean?

01:46.815 --> 01:47.899
Exactly.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.319
Aw. Poor Elena.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.863
So hard being a teenager
in a relationship.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.784
Yeah, kids. Take 'em or leave 'em, right?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.665
Seems to me like you kinda love kids.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.292
These two, they're always
at each other's throats.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.463
Alex, you are the best. Thank you so much.
[exclaims]

02:10.547 --> 02:12.507
So passive-aggressive.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.969
Is everything okay?

02:16.678 --> 02:17.929
Yes.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.807
You know how you sometimes
have a great, healthy meal,

02:20.890 --> 02:22.475
and two hours later,
you're over the toilet

02:22.559 --> 02:23.935
with fire shooting out both ends?

02:24.018 --> 02:25.520
That's my life right now.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.107
So, Penelope, I'm sensing some stress.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.568
Uh, you think, Pam?
Yeah, I'm freaking stressed. [laughs]

02:33.361 --> 02:36.948
Everything was going
so great with Max.

02:37.031 --> 02:40.034
I mean, you should see this guy.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.037
Imagine if Bradley Cooper
was stuck in a gym for almost a year

02:43.121 --> 02:45.498
with nothing to eat but hotness pills.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.250
Okay, yes.

02:48.167 --> 02:52.714
Maybe if Bradley Cooper was stuck in a gym
with Charlize Theron...

02:55.425 --> 02:56.968
and Bradley Cooper left.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.555
[chuckles]

03:00.638 --> 03:02.473
I don't want to have any kids.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.267
It sounds like you need to tell Max that.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.605
Yeah. You hop up on a stool,
you look him in the eye and you be tough.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.567
Make him think you could burn down
that garage, but you don't actually do it.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.447
I wish somebody
would've given me that advice.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.450
If he breaks up with you
because of that, that's on him.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.618
He'll find someone else.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.536
Does he like Korean barbecue?

03:24.954 --> 03:28.499
Sorry, super-duper Bradley Cooper,
I'm only a human woman.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.753
Well, of course, if we did have a baby,

03:31.836 --> 03:35.215
it would be like a tall me,
so it'd be pretty hot.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.300
I mean, that baby would have everything.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.511
Wait, are you actually
thinking about this?

03:40.595 --> 03:41.846
I'm just saying I'd have a hot baby.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.392
-Pen...
-No. I'm almost 40, okay?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.644
What am I going to do?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.729
Have one kid in college,
one kid in high school,

03:49.812 --> 03:51.564
and one kid hanging off my boob?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.484
Honestly, these just started
looking normal again.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.071
There were a couple of years
there where it was like... [clicks tongue]

04:00.531 --> 04:03.076
And, you know,
my mom's not getting any younger,

04:03.159 --> 04:05.954
and soon I'm gonna have to take
care of her too. No. No. [clicks tongue]

04:06.037 --> 04:07.664
Maybe you need to tell Max

04:07.747 --> 04:10.959
that you're making decisions
that privilege self-care,

04:11.042 --> 04:14.504
even if that leads to a conscious
uncoupling of your relationship.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.048
What's that mean?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.718
You gotta throw truth at him, girl.
Even if he bails.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.638
If you don't want a baby, don't be a baby.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.681
Oh!

04:26.766 --> 04:29.978
You're right. You're right.
I have to lay down the law.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.187
Ugh.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.357
-What am I thinking? A baby. Smelly. Loud.
-Mmm-mmm.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.819
Drains all your life force away.
Oh, who needs that? Mmm-mmm.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.321
So, Beth, what's been going on with you?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.115
Well... [chuckles]

04:42.198 --> 04:44.450
-I'm pregnant. [chuckles]
-[all] Aw.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.334
Congratulations.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.547
[theme song playing]

05:44.302 --> 05:47.305
Abuelita,  you're still studying?
Don't you know everything by now?

05:47.805 --> 05:51.893
Of course. I'm just trying to avoid
getting propositioned by all these guys.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.481
The process is a breeze.
There is nothing to be nervous about.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.735
[Schneider sighs]

06:05.490 --> 06:07.617
They didn't call my name yet, did they?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.578
What the hell are you wearing?

06:10.661 --> 06:12.705
I'm trying to look more American.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.708
Is it not working? [scoffs]
I should have brought a gun.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.547
-Are you okay?
-No!

06:22.298 --> 06:23.508
[scoffs]

06:23.591 --> 06:27.470
Last night, I was testing the pH
of the water in my seahorse ranch and,

06:28.513 --> 06:33.851
as I looked at those vomiting little guys,
I realized I suck at tests.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.228
All tests.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.689
Drug, sobriety, vision, IQ, smog.
You name it, I fail it!

06:40.775 --> 06:43.111
Relax,  pobrecito  Schneider.

06:43.194 --> 06:47.990
Look, look, look, you go in, they ask you
a few questions, you come out.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.368
Fricky-fracky. American.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.830
See?

07:01.129 --> 07:04.423
Oh, my God!
They're gonna send me to Gitmo!

07:06.300 --> 07:07.969
Hi, folks. I'm looking for

07:08.052 --> 07:14.809
Lydia Margarita Del Carmen Inclan
Maribona Leytevidal de Riera.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.102
Ooh, that's fun.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.688
Hello.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.860
He seems nice.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.654
Listen up, people,
because I'm only gonna say this once.

07:28.156 --> 07:33.119
First name is a little, uh, smudged.
Uh, something Schneider?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.288
You'll do great.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.247
Go get 'em.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.499
[chuckles]

07:41.210 --> 07:42.670
You like my outfit? [chuckles]

07:43.421 --> 07:44.505
Oh, boy.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.889
He's screwed.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.058
Yeah, I'm gonna miss him.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.484
Are you okay, Penelope?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.194
Yeah. Sure, Doc. Why?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.406
You put a blood sample label
on my pudding cup and sent it to the lab.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.616
Oh.

08:12.408 --> 08:16.496
We cannot make mistakes like that.
Now I have no pudding.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.292
[sighs] I'm sorry. I guess I've just been
a little distracted.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.460
What's up?

08:23.127 --> 08:26.631
Believe it or not, I've been thinking
about having a baby. [chuckles]

08:26.714 --> 08:28.466
It's crazy, right? What do you think?

08:30.259 --> 08:33.221
I think I've never been so flattered.
I'll do it.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.142
Me? As the sperm donor?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.561
A short, Latino me with hair?

08:40.645 --> 08:42.813
Oh, man, that baby'd have everything.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.943
Okay. [laughs]

08:47.026 --> 08:49.612
No, I am not talking about you, Doc.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.239
I'm talking about Max.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.658
Well, if that's the way you want to go.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.245
But seriously, Doc, be honest.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.497
Having a baby at my age,
it's crazy, right?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.332
No, not at all. I...

09:01.415 --> 09:05.336
There is risk,
but modern medicine has come a long way.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.587
You're in great health.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.466
With proper prenatal care,
you could have babies for the next decade.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.093
Don't tell me that, Doc!

09:13.219 --> 09:16.806
Tell me I'm old and dried up,
and that my uterus is full of sand.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.849
Something that's gonna
make me feel better.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.019
Look, you're gonna have
to make up your mind,

09:22.103 --> 09:26.065
but if this is something you want to do
with Max, you could.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.360
Thanks a lot, Doc.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.948
Now, when I come back after nine months
with a healthy Latino Bradley Cooper baby,

09:34.031 --> 09:35.074
it'll be your fault.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.414
All righty,
your application looks complete.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.708
Beautiful penmanship, by the way.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.334
Thank you. [chuckles]

09:45.418 --> 09:49.630
When you are a dancer,
even your fingers sashay.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.467
I'm a dancer myself.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.137
Mostly square.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.388
Sometimes line.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.310
I can tell by the fire in your eyes.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.731
It's my allergies, but thank you.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.778
Why don't we do-si-do
into your civics test?

10:12.862 --> 10:13.779
Okay.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.241
Name three of the original 13 states.

10:17.742 --> 10:22.663
Oh, I can name them all.
But I will go for my favorite three.

10:22.747 --> 10:29.670
Eh, South Carolina,
Georgia and Rhode Island.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.756
[chuckles]

10:31.839 --> 10:33.215
Where is the Statue of Liberty?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.551
New York. Wait. New Jersey?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.386
She's straddling the border.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.931
Uh, but I'm guessing
her butt's facing New Jersey. [laughs]

10:41.015 --> 10:42.725
I'm from New Jersey.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.355
Great town.
[in New Jersey accent] Forget about it.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.442
[in normal voice] Beautiful cat.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.568
That's my daughter.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.988
[chuckles nervously]

10:57.865 --> 11:00.451
Would your daughter
like to go out sometime?

11:05.122 --> 11:07.375
Or is she an inside daughter?

11:10.044 --> 11:12.546
Have you ever been convicted of a crime?

11:13.089 --> 11:18.678
My beloved Berto and I
once made love in the park.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.848
Well, uh, that's certainly naughty.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.607
But you weren't arrested,
so it doesn't count as a crime.

11:31.690 --> 11:35.194
Oh, it was a crime.
A crime that no one saw us.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.906
Have you ever been arrested?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.410
Does public nudity at a hockey game count?

11:43.369 --> 11:47.998
There is, uh, no mention of
a public nudity charge in your file.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.918
Oh, you just go to YouTube
and type in "Zam-boner."

11:52.962 --> 11:54.672
Well, if it's not in here,

11:54.755 --> 11:57.967
we may need to re-run
your background check.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.141
Oh, no. Are you in handcuffs?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.600
No, I passed!

12:06.684 --> 12:08.644
-Yay!
-Congratulations!

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
[Schneider laughing]

12:11.981 --> 12:14.024
Please read the underlined words.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.401
No problem.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.029
[in heavy accent]
"The fox is on the bitch."

12:22.283 --> 12:23.659
That is correct.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.787
The  fox  is on the  beach.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.123
That's what I said.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.042
Mm-hmm.

12:34.670 --> 12:39.550
Well, you are a delightful candidate
for citizenship.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.926
-Ooh.
-And friendship.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.470
[gasps]

12:43.679 --> 12:45.598
-[chuckles]
-So, let's just...

12:46.932 --> 12:47.850
Oh.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.060
That's interesting.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.980
Everything about me is interesting.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.732
Which are you referring to?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.651
Please wait outside, Mrs. Riera.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.863
Oh.

13:02.072 --> 13:02.907
Okay.

13:04.575 --> 13:09.497
In the, uh, waiting room? [chuckles]

13:13.626 --> 13:14.919
Ooh, here comes  Abuelita.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.338
-Felicidades. Muy bien hecho.
-All right!

13:17.421 --> 13:18.589
Way to go.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.883
What? What? Is something wrong?

13:21.550 --> 13:23.969
I don't know. He said to wait here.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.141
Maybe they make everyone wait
while they figure out if you passed.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.392
They didn't do that with me.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.395
She told me I passed in the room
and then I showed her my YouTube video.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.064
Don't look for it.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.192
I answered every question.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.945
I aced the English test.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.572
Did I do something wrong?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.907
[Elena sighs]

13:44.990 --> 13:46.700
This is because you're Latinx.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.119
The white guy goes in there
and cruises to citizenship,

13:49.203 --> 13:51.247
despite having nothing
to offer this country.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.666
That's right.
Wait, are you talking about me?

13:56.085 --> 13:58.128
Could I lose my green card?

13:58.212 --> 13:59.213
-[gasps]
-[Alex] No.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.048
I'm sure everything's okay.

14:01.131 --> 14:05.052
Maybe. You would not be the first proud
immigrant who got treated like a criminal.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
I cannot believe this.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.683
It is this government today.

14:10.766 --> 14:15.396
This whole country has changed.
It has turned to caca.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.234
This has been my home for more
than 50 years, and they don't want me?

14:20.317 --> 14:22.862
Well, I don't want them.

14:22.945 --> 14:27.908
Oh, Lydia, sorry, we just had a typo
in your social. You passed.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.749
Welcome to America.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.751
I love this country.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.046
[Lydia chuckles]

14:41.130 --> 14:42.631
[knock at door]

14:45.885 --> 14:48.387
-Hey, Schneider.
-[Schneider] Hey.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.433
Hey!  Mami  told me you somehow passed.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.435
Congratulations!

14:54.518 --> 14:56.604
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, they didn't specifically ask

14:56.687 --> 15:00.649
if I got drunk and tried to ride a moose,
so after that I was golden.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.985
Hey, can we talk?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.446
[sighs] I need a man's perspective.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.324
How important is having kids to you?

15:09.825 --> 15:11.076
Never really thought about it.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.205
Then why are you holding one?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.250
Oh, this thing? [chuckles]

15:19.251 --> 15:21.712
This is Mikey McGurb,
the McGurbs' grandson.

15:21.795 --> 15:22.838
I'm just babysitting.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.550
Okay, serious question,
have you ever met a baby before?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.846
I'll have you know
I babysat my babysitter's kids

15:30.930 --> 15:32.389
while she was babysitting my dad,

15:32.473 --> 15:35.059
so, yeah, I got a little experience
under my belt.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.145
[cell phone vibrating]

15:39.939 --> 15:43.734
Oh, it's my cousin Gordy.
He still thinks I'm full-on Canadian.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.362
I gotta ease him into it.
Could you just...

15:46.445 --> 15:48.656
-Oh, no. Is he gonna be okay?
-Oh, yeah. You're all good.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.949
-[baby cooing]
-[chuckles]

15:50.032 --> 15:52.910
Gordo, ya hoser, how you doin', eh?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.538
[cooing]

15:59.833 --> 16:01.293
Babies are so stupid.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.885
Why you so stupid, huh?

16:11.887 --> 16:12.721
Hey.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.681
Hey.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.848
[coos]

16:14.932 --> 16:15.933
Hi.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.978
Oh, yes. Oh, my goodness.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.189
You are pretty stinking cute.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.609
All right, good news is Gordo bought it.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.571
Bad news is I'm judging a poutine festival
in Saskatoon next week.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.782
[sighs]

16:33.450 --> 16:34.284
You okay?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.704
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.749
It's just everything
I've been going through with Max.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.584
He wants to have a baby.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.337
-Whoa.
-[sighs]

16:47.256 --> 16:51.093
When I hold this little nugget
in my arms, I think it's not so bad.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.347
-In fact, it's kind of amazing. [chuckles]
-[cooing]

16:56.473 --> 16:58.809
Wow. Well...

17:00.894 --> 17:02.438
I don't know what you want...

17:03.897 --> 17:07.401
but I do know that if you choose
to have another kid, you'll be incredible.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.530
You're the single greatest mother I know.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.658
Thank you.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.161
That means a lot
coming from a guy with five moms.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.083
And thank you, Mikey McGurb.

17:24.376 --> 17:31.341
Thank you for reminding me
that I do want to hold a baby again.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.928
[sniffs]

17:35.596 --> 17:38.557
Someday, when I'm a grandmother.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.895
[baby cooing]

17:42.978 --> 17:44.563
[both chuckle]

17:44.646 --> 17:45.981
He likes you.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.866
-Max, we need to talk.
-[sighs]

17:56.950 --> 17:59.787
I have been obsessing about something
you said the other day.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.916
Oh. I just think Arby's is underrated.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.712
Not the best, just solid.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.467
No. Not that. Although you are dead wrong,
it is a barf factory.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.344
No, no.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.849
I'm talking about when you said
you wanted to have kids.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.560
[chuckles]

18:24.269 --> 18:26.605
I knew something was bothering you.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.399
[sighs] I shouldn't have said anything.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.611
We're so new
and I didn't mean to freak you out.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.570
I was just talking.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.240
But you were serious?

18:36.323 --> 18:39.368
Well, yeah, I see myself
becoming a dad someday,

18:39.451 --> 18:42.037
but it is way too early
to have that conversation.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.080
No, no.

18:43.163 --> 18:48.293
See, that's the thing. It's about
ten years too late for this conversation.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.506
I'm turning 40, Max...

18:54.591 --> 18:57.970
and talking about this isn't going to get
any easier, the longer we wait.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.351
[sighs] I didn't know
you were stressing about this.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.562
I'm really sorry.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.981
No. I don't want you to be sorry.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.359
Don't be sorry. I get that you want kids.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.070
It's a great thing, it's the best thing.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.491
But I know that
because I've already done it.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.953
And I'm done with it.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.292
Oh.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.504
Uh, okay.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.760
Yeah, no, I mean, no,
I understand, you know.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.851
Being a father was something
I always wanted.

19:46.435 --> 19:51.273
You know, babies and watch them grow up.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.610
[grunts softly] All those firsts.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.159
But, hey, hey, hey,
if it's a deal-breaker, I can let it go.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.204
[clicks tongue] Really?

20:05.787 --> 20:06.872
[chuckles softly]

20:06.955 --> 20:11.960
Yeah. [sighs] Look,
I just want to be with you.

20:14.171 --> 20:19.176
I love your kids... and I love you.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.767
I love you too.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.400
Ah! Good, you are here.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.988
[sing-song] I want to show you something.

20:41.156 --> 20:45.410
Oh, great. I guess Schneider told you
that I was thinking of having a baby.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.829
-What?
-You're having a baby?

20:48.747 --> 20:52.125
No! I'm not having a baby.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.835
I told Schneider that Max wanted kids,

20:53.919 --> 20:57.464
and obviously, Schneider told  Abuelita
because he's a  chismosa  at heart.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.759
No, Schneider did not say a thing.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.512
This is what I want to show you.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.943
[laughing] I took the crib out of storage

21:18.026 --> 21:22.239
because Schneider wanted it
for the  gordito  that he is babysitting.

21:22.322 --> 21:29.121
But I'm saving it for you now, because
this is much more exciting. [exclaims]

21:29.204 --> 21:32.749
No,  Mami,  not happening.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.585
Never say never, Lupe.

21:35.669 --> 21:40.424
I said I would never be anything
but Cuban, but here I am, Miss America.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.513
[vocalizing "The Star-Spangled Banner"]

21:58.775 --> 22:03.030
Okay. Well,  Mami,  I am certain
that I'm not having a baby with Max

22:03.113 --> 22:04.489
because we just broke up.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.951
No.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.329
[sighs] I knew he was too pretty
to be straight.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.126
Okay, we can salvage this.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.129
I'll text him a slot machine,
a bowl of ramen and a circus tent.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.714
He'll come crawling back.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.300
It's my decision.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.720
I know you guys really liked him,
but it is for the best.

22:27.679 --> 22:31.141
He wants kids
and I've already had my kids.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.727
Even though he says he's okay with that,

22:33.810 --> 22:37.564
I know down the road, he is gonna regret
missing his chance to be a dad.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.568
And I love him, and I don't want
to deprive him of the experience

22:41.651 --> 22:43.737
because I know how amazing it is.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.035
I'm sorry,  Mami.
It sounds like you did the right thing.

22:51.161 --> 22:55.040
Plus, the last time you had a baby,
you got it right.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.257
Walk away from the table,  Mami.
Know when to fold 'em.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.845
[chuckles] I love you dopes.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.056
[chuckles] We love you too.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.185
-Homework.
-[both groan]

23:23.443 --> 23:25.320
You are making a mistake.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.364
Mami,  don't.

23:27.447 --> 23:32.786
A good man is hard to find
and you have found a good man.

23:34.246 --> 23:39.042
Lupita, I have spent so many years alone.
It's not something you want.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.379
Really? 'Cause right now,
I would love to be alone.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.215
Yeah, but who's going to take care of you?

23:45.298 --> 23:47.300
I'm not going to be around forever.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.219
I can take care of myself, okay?

23:49.302 --> 23:50.929
Yes, but you shouldn't have to.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.765
I mean,  mira,  if down the road,

23:53.849 --> 23:58.061
Max wants a baby, pfft,  y qué?

23:58.145 --> 24:02.023
A baby would be wonderful.
A gift from God.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.025
I've got to do what's right for me.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.904
If you love him, you can make it work.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.200
How dare you say that?

24:12.284 --> 24:16.830
Come on. This is the hardest decision
I've made since I left Victor,

24:16.913 --> 24:18.290
and you're making it even harder.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.792
Oh, you are just mad
because you know I am right.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.170
I made a painful decision,

24:23.253 --> 24:25.338
and the last thing I need
is for you to tell me

24:25.422 --> 24:27.382
what an idiot I am for having made it.

24:27.465 --> 24:30.510
Oye.  I am not just some pushy old lady.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.345
-[scoffs]
-And I know you.

24:32.429 --> 24:37.017
I know you better than anyone
on this Earth and I am telling you

24:37.976 --> 24:39.978
this is a mistake!

24:40.061 --> 24:41.813
Then it's my mistake to make!

24:41.897 --> 24:44.107
And it's not a mistake. So you know what?

24:44.191 --> 24:46.860
If you've got any more advice,
keep it to yourself,

24:46.943 --> 24:49.154
'cause I don't want it.
Or anything else from you!

24:49.237 --> 24:50.197
¡Ya!

25:00.040 --> 25:01.333
Good night, Lupe.

25:07.505 --> 25:10.217
Maybe you will have more sense
in the morning.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.604
[Spanish song playing]

25:30.946 --> 25:36.743
Mami,  I got up early
to get us  pastelitos  and coffee.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.661
We gotta get going.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.788
We gotta get downtown
for the swearing-in ceremony.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.626
Mami?

25:49.673 --> 25:55.220
Look, if you're mad about yesterday,
I am sorry that things got so heated.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.681
[sighs]

25:58.515 --> 26:00.725
Mami,  whatever,
we gotta get going, we have--

26:00.809 --> 26:02.352
[gasps]

26:02.435 --> 26:03.561
Mami!

26:04.396 --> 26:05.522
Mami!

26:07.107 --> 26:09.526
[Spanish song continues]
