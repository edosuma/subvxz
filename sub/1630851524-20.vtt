is no small feat.

get his money back,

We've got him in custody
for robbing a jeweler.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.770

her mother was shopping,

01:58.814 --> 02:00.250
she turned her back
for a moment,

02:00.294 --> 02:02.600

She suffers from asthma,

which was exacerbated
by her chemo.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.349
- Mm-hmm.

at any moment,
she could be triggered

Sara soon,

a person of interest.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.768
He runs the Marcy Killers.

on the Brotherhood
