00:14.662 --> 00:16.579
The Pasta Primavera.

00:19.849 --> 00:21.584
This is chicken.

00:21.669 --> 00:23.252
(short sigh)

00:23.337 --> 00:25.504
I'm so sorry.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.887
- This is fine.
- Don't worry.

00:26.907 --> 00:27.590
I'll take care of you.

00:27.642 --> 00:29.225
I'm counting on it.

00:34.616 --> 00:36.432
The Primavera.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.083
- Funny.
- Excuse me?

00:40.371 --> 00:41.270
Ah...

00:41.322 --> 00:44.356
- This is not my fault. I swear.
- It's okay.

00:44.442 --> 00:45.734
I'll just settle for the chicken.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.068
I don't want you to settle.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.611
Then you eat it.

00:48.663 --> 00:50.647
Would that make you happy?

00:50.667 --> 00:52.249
Very.

00:53.501 --> 00:55.417
How about a roll?

00:57.956 --> 00:58.837
Russ...

00:59.849 --> 01:01.507
- (echoes): <i>Russ...</i>
- Russ: <i>Uh...</i>

01:01.592 --> 01:05.461
Russ!
Did you eat all these rolls last night?

01:07.139 --> 01:09.021
You were night eating again.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.399
Oh, shit.

Miranda: <i>Am I driving</i>

01:18.359 --> 01:20.693
- or are we taking separate cars?
- What?

01:21.554 --> 01:23.529
Sergio and Mike's...
they're having a tequila tasting.

01:23.614 --> 01:26.365
Oof. Yeah, I already know
what tequila tastes like.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.095
Although, you know what, I've never

01:28.115 --> 01:30.329
had it served to me by
a couple of douche bags.

01:30.349 --> 01:31.973
We're going.

01:31.993 --> 01:33.539
No, I can't.

01:33.624 --> 01:36.531
Lina is going out tonight
and I told her I'd cover.

01:36.551 --> 01:39.328
Look, the guys made me promise

01:39.413 --> 01:41.497
that I would bring you with me, so...

01:41.549 --> 01:43.620
Why do they care if I come?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.613
They want to talk business.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.164
Secret business.

01:58.488 --> 02:00.349
If I uber right now,
would you be able to get my car

02:00.401 --> 02:02.199
back to the office in the morning?

02:02.219 --> 02:04.520
I am off the clock, boss man. Ugh.

02:04.605 --> 02:06.522
- Come on.
- Sorry about it.

02:06.607 --> 02:08.273
(laughs softly) Oh...

02:08.359 --> 02:10.359
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, bro.

02:10.411 --> 02:12.444
- You got to check this shit out.
- Okay, back down.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.279
It's an old bank on Olympic.

02:14.365 --> 02:16.248
We just signed the lease. Mike and I.

02:16.334 --> 02:18.617
You're... gonna go into banking?

02:18.703 --> 02:21.203
No,
we're gonna convert it into a design space.

02:21.288 --> 02:23.190
We're starting our own firm.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.457
- So you're quitting?
- Did you show him the vault?

02:25.543 --> 02:26.709
- Not yet, man.
- What the hell, man?

02:26.761 --> 02:28.544
- Show him the vault.
- All right.

02:28.629 --> 02:29.545
You see this giant metal door?

02:29.630 --> 02:31.401
- Yeah.
- That's the vault

02:31.421 --> 02:34.116
where they used to keep all the cash.

02:34.271 --> 02:36.385
And that's where Mike and
I are gonna have our desks.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.270
Miranda: How cool is that?

02:38.356 --> 02:40.320
That's so... that's awesome.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.833
Listen, Russ,
we're big fans of what you do,

02:42.853 --> 02:44.360
think you're an amazing designer

02:44.395 --> 02:48.003
and we also think there's room
for a third desk in that vault.

02:53.714 --> 02:56.130
Russ: <i>Let me ask you something.
Hypothetically,</i>

02:56.150 --> 02:58.953
is there... any chance that we could

02:58.973 --> 03:01.326
get health insurance
through the school district?

03:01.412 --> 03:03.212
(snorts, chuckles)

03:03.247 --> 03:06.298
Look, I doubt I'll even make
it to the end of the year.

03:07.430 --> 03:08.417
Budget cuts.

03:08.469 --> 03:11.101
Second grade is cutting
back to only one TA,

03:11.121 --> 03:14.379
so it's between me and
a guy who gives a shit.

03:14.592 --> 03:16.341
(wry laugh)

03:17.063 --> 03:18.510
Unbelievable.

03:18.596 --> 03:20.679
You're not even gonna try?

03:21.393 --> 03:23.871
- He plays guitar.
- So what?

03:23.891 --> 03:25.706
Since when do you care about my job,
anyway?

03:25.726 --> 03:27.519
You're always saying I
can quit whenever I want.

03:27.605 --> 03:29.521
Well, yeah. You can. I just...

03:29.607 --> 03:31.490
What if I wanted to switch things up,
you know?

03:31.575 --> 03:33.525
Like take a chance or a risk

03:33.611 --> 03:36.245
and-and do something different,

03:36.280 --> 03:38.363
you know, that's more fulfilling?

03:38.983 --> 03:40.449
- Do you?
- I don't know.

03:40.501 --> 03:42.534
It doesn't matter, you know?

03:43.140 --> 03:45.312
If you can't keep a job, what's the point?

03:47.291 --> 03:49.614
(doorbell rings)

03:51.056 --> 03:51.627
Russ: Hey.

03:51.712 --> 03:53.345
Hey, sorry we're late.

03:53.431 --> 03:54.630
Abby and I were fighting.

03:54.682 --> 03:56.515
We're not fighting.

03:57.308 --> 03:58.517
I am.

03:58.602 --> 04:00.469
Hey,
did you know that Abby thinks it's okay

04:00.554 --> 04:03.086
to lie to someone that you're
in a relationship with?

04:03.303 --> 04:04.808
I didn't lie. I just...

04:04.828 --> 04:06.685
forgot to tell him
that my parents are visiting.

04:06.705 --> 04:10.031
Yeah. I had to find out from a seven year
old like I am some kind of asshole.

04:10.051 --> 04:12.314
I really feel like Russ and
Lina don't want to listen to us

04:12.366 --> 04:14.283
- fight right now.
- Are you kidding? Do you know

04:14.318 --> 04:16.485
how many of their stupid
fights I've had to listen to?

04:16.570 --> 04:17.619
We don't fight in front of you.

04:17.654 --> 04:19.370
- Oh, really?
- No.

04:19.457 --> 04:21.623
Okay. Grandma's ashes.

04:21.659 --> 04:23.375
Too many shoes.

04:23.461 --> 04:25.210
Universal remote. Should I go on?

04:25.296 --> 04:26.462
- I think we got it.
- That's not even...

04:26.497 --> 04:27.629
- Not enough coasters.
- Okay.

04:27.665 --> 04:29.414
Fridge versus freezer.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.678
Lina: <i>Abby really cares about you.</i>

04:31.698 --> 04:33.252
Maybe she shouldn't have lied to me.

04:33.337 --> 04:36.502
- If I were you, I wouldn't push it.
- Too late.

04:36.522 --> 04:38.223
Already demanded a brunch.

04:38.309 --> 04:41.260
- Do you really think that's a good idea?
- Relax.

04:41.345 --> 04:42.311
They're gonna love me.

04:42.346 --> 04:43.645
(grunts)

04:43.681 --> 04:46.565
- I wish I had your confidence.
- Hey, between

04:46.650 --> 04:48.350
breast-feeding and gravity,

04:48.402 --> 04:50.808
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

04:51.118 --> 04:53.322
I was talking about my job. Oh.

04:53.357 --> 04:54.945
What's going on?

04:54.965 --> 04:56.325
If I don't step up my game,

04:56.360 --> 04:58.265
they're not gonna bring me back next year.

04:58.285 --> 04:59.578
So step it up.

04:59.663 --> 05:01.363
Believe me. I tried to step it up.

05:01.448 --> 05:02.614
I even brought in a worm.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.449
(laughs)

05:04.535 --> 05:07.276
I think you have to think
a little bigger than that.

05:07.296 --> 05:10.988
What if you invited a
celebrity into the class?

05:11.143 --> 05:12.958
Or maybe...

05:13.486 --> 05:15.294
the author of a hopefully

05:15.379 --> 05:17.942
soon-to-be bestselling children's book?

05:18.283 --> 05:19.865
You?

05:20.408 --> 05:21.383
I could read <i> Farmer Todd.</i>

05:21.435 --> 05:24.603
If the kids didn't respond to Ethel Worman,

05:24.688 --> 05:28.223
they're probably not gonna be
into a dude reading a book.

05:28.275 --> 05:30.442
What if we jazzed it up a little?

05:33.112 --> 05:36.565
<i>Farmer Todd Has A Problem</i>
is going to Broadway.

05:36.617 --> 05:40.235
But first we're workshopping
it at Valley Palms Elementary.

05:40.287 --> 05:41.537
As a play?

05:41.572 --> 05:43.405
As an adorable, socially relevant

05:43.457 --> 05:46.575
piece of edu-tainment.

05:46.595 --> 05:49.411
That's great. Oh, that's great. Um...

05:49.463 --> 05:51.496
Listen, when my parents get here,
maybe don't talk

05:51.582 --> 05:55.250
about <i> Farmer Todd</i> or your drinking or,
you know,

05:55.302 --> 05:58.503
your demons or how you went cuckoo, or...

05:59.608 --> 06:00.472
Cuckoo?

06:00.558 --> 06:03.392
Sorry, I-I just..
I don't know all the terminology.

06:03.427 --> 06:05.561
I mean, you know, just be normal.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.262
(scoffing chuckle) Normal, huh?

06:07.348 --> 06:08.263
(door opens, bells jangle)

06:08.349 --> 06:10.265
Mom. Dad.

06:10.351 --> 06:12.569
This is AJ.

06:13.019 --> 06:15.283
And I'm totally normal. Hm.

06:18.833 --> 06:21.096
Now, AJ, what is it you do?

06:21.116 --> 06:23.267
- I'm a author.
- How lovely.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.568
Tell us a little bit about
the stuff you've written.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.726
I'm not really allowed to talk about it.

06:30.811 --> 06:32.678
AJ's a very successful lawyer.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.897
- Not anymore.
- Like John Grisham...

06:34.982 --> 06:36.899
you quit to do what you love.

06:36.984 --> 06:39.018
- Good for you.
- Not exactly.

06:39.103 --> 06:41.653
I had some...

06:41.689 --> 06:44.857
medical issues,
and my partners bought me out.

06:44.909 --> 06:46.692
Is everything okay?

06:46.744 --> 06:49.661
If it's a prostate thing, I've got a guy.

06:51.638 --> 06:54.833
No, everything is great.

06:54.869 --> 06:57.586
I just wish I had more time
to spend with you guys.

06:57.671 --> 06:58.787
You're going?

06:58.873 --> 07:00.672
Oh, Abby didn't tell you?

07:00.708 --> 07:02.875
I-I have another engagement.

07:03.273 --> 07:04.877
But...

07:04.929 --> 07:05.878
I've taken care of the bill.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.220
Have a lovely visit.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.342
You can't stay longer, honey?

07:09.362 --> 07:11.717
No, I can't.

07:11.802 --> 07:12.935
Honey.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.039
He's really busy.

07:18.059 --> 07:20.784
This is... totally normal.

07:21.896 --> 07:23.896
He's very normal.

07:26.874 --> 07:28.951
(sighs) All right, uh,

07:29.036 --> 07:30.535
bad news.

07:30.555 --> 07:33.252
Gil wants to see new
stuff before the weekend.

07:35.263 --> 07:36.792
I know. I know.

07:41.355 --> 07:43.333
Aren't you sick of taking
orders from that clown?

07:43.353 --> 07:45.918
Yeah, you know what, you're always
taking orders from someone...

07:46.003 --> 07:48.837
bosses, clients, you know?
What does it matter?

07:48.923 --> 07:52.345
Not if you come to the vault.
We'll all be partners.

07:52.692 --> 07:54.293
We'll just argue with each other.

07:54.313 --> 07:56.465
Come on, man, seriously.
This is a big opportunity.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.764
Look,
the idea of becoming a partner somewhere

07:58.816 --> 08:01.742
is exciting, but I have security here.

08:01.762 --> 08:02.818
Do you?

08:02.903 --> 08:04.770
I mean, Gil has us stealing
designs from everywhere.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.428
What happens when this job is over

08:06.448 --> 08:08.607
and Gil's ruined your reputation?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.777
Then maybe I'll come work for you guys.

08:11.862 --> 08:14.997
Maybe then...
we won't have a position open.

08:15.082 --> 08:17.616
(sighs)

08:17.668 --> 08:19.785
Lina: <i> I started</i> <i>and then I couldn't stop.</i>

08:19.837 --> 08:23.005
We have corn. Um, the barn...

08:23.090 --> 08:24.706
And, um...

08:25.965 --> 08:27.793
your milk.

08:27.845 --> 08:29.554
Farmer Todd is coming to life.

08:29.574 --> 08:32.346
Really? It's crazy. I-It is becoming

08:32.366 --> 08:35.683
a living, breathing thing. I-It's...

08:36.986 --> 08:38.191
- Thank you.
- All right.

08:38.211 --> 08:40.479
Let's start rehearsal.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.693
We're haveing a little bit of a
wardrobe issue with Farmer Todd.

08:43.894 --> 08:46.249
Because Farmer Todd has these
dum-dum overalls.

08:46.634 --> 08:47.118
Really?

08:47.138 --> 08:49.650
- I like the overalls.
- Bernie: They're a little on the nose.

08:49.670 --> 08:51.867
What-what about this,
what about tight jeans,

08:51.887 --> 08:54.284
wife beater, moto boots, real...

08:54.304 --> 08:56.282
Tom of... Tom of Finland vibe.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.702
That's only good if
you're farming nightmares.

08:58.722 --> 08:59.992
Abby: Hey, theater people.

09:00.077 --> 09:01.627
I brought coffee.

09:01.662 --> 09:03.829
Okay, we're-we're very busy.

09:03.849 --> 09:05.536
Okay?

09:06.193 --> 09:07.833
Look...

09:07.853 --> 09:09.916
I'm sorry.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.803
I know you're mad at me.

09:11.839 --> 09:13.639
I just wanted my parents to like you.

09:13.674 --> 09:15.841
I get it. I embarrass you.

09:15.861 --> 09:17.168
- No.
- That makes sense.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.645
No, you-you... I just turn into this,

09:19.680 --> 09:20.846
like, 15-year-old version

09:20.898 --> 09:22.848
of myself when I'm around my parents.

09:22.868 --> 09:24.683
Let me make it up to you. Do you want to...

09:24.768 --> 09:26.735
do something after the play?

09:26.820 --> 09:29.688
I don't know how I'll feel after the play.

09:29.773 --> 09:31.961
I don't have a crystal ball.

09:40.951 --> 09:41.867
Hey.

09:41.952 --> 09:43.785
Hey.

09:45.005 --> 09:48.040
So... it's happening.

09:48.918 --> 09:50.926
(whispers): What is happening?

09:51.462 --> 09:54.596
Well, Sergio and Mike

09:54.616 --> 09:56.048
talked to a few clients

09:56.133 --> 09:58.934
and there was a real
openness to the clients

09:59.019 --> 10:00.719
moving with them.

10:00.739 --> 10:02.771
Really? Mm-hmm.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.022
Which clients?

10:04.058 --> 10:05.684
These guys.

10:08.389 --> 10:09.761
(wry chuckle) If all these clients left,

10:09.797 --> 10:11.797
I might be out of a job.

10:11.849 --> 10:13.599
Not if you went with them.

10:13.634 --> 10:15.396
Do you really think those
guys can pull this off?

10:15.416 --> 10:17.519
I don't know, but just promise me that,

10:17.605 --> 10:18.971
if you do leave, you'll take me with you.

10:19.056 --> 10:21.564
Absolutely.
I would bring you on as a designer.

10:21.824 --> 10:24.693
- Really?
- Yeah. Totally.

10:24.713 --> 10:25.944
You're crazy talented.

10:25.980 --> 10:27.613
(laughs) Really?

10:27.648 --> 10:28.814
Your stuff is awesome.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.699
Oh, my... (kisses)

10:30.784 --> 10:33.702
You... are awesome.

10:34.151 --> 10:35.737
Seriously.

10:41.829 --> 10:43.220
(sighs)

10:52.586 --> 10:55.084
Have you had a chance
to look over the menu?

10:55.295 --> 10:56.866
What's good today?

10:56.886 --> 10:58.456
Everything is good.

10:59.782 --> 11:01.459
Just bring whatever.

11:01.512 --> 11:03.595
I just want to bring you what you want.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.380
Surprise me.

11:06.570 --> 11:08.133
(groans)

11:08.185 --> 11:10.023
Unbelievable.

11:10.043 --> 11:11.425
Everything okay?

11:11.445 --> 11:13.187
I can't make her happy.

11:13.207 --> 11:15.357
Forget about her.

11:15.377 --> 11:17.475
You have me.

11:17.528 --> 11:18.762
What?

11:18.782 --> 11:23.148
You can have me whenever you want.

11:25.202 --> 11:27.118
(steam hissing)

11:42.822 --> 11:44.634
Where are we going?

11:44.907 --> 11:47.339
Anywhere you want.

11:48.444 --> 11:49.884
Maya: Daddy?

11:49.904 --> 11:52.130
Daddy? Daddy, stop!

11:52.150 --> 11:53.445
Daddy!

11:53.465 --> 11:55.284
Dad, stop!

11:55.420 --> 11:56.674
Dad.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.262
Stop, dad.

11:58.548 --> 12:01.079
That was for mommys play.

12:03.846 --> 12:05.484
Oh shit.

12:10.907 --> 12:12.364
(grunts)

12:12.416 --> 12:14.332
I need more milk.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.251
Where's that durn cow?

12:18.074 --> 12:20.338
You forgot your line, Alex.

12:21.027 --> 12:22.207
I'll handle it.

12:22.259 --> 12:23.291
Alex...

12:23.377 --> 12:25.427
I'd like to tell you a little story

12:25.512 --> 12:29.514
about a kid, just like you, named Bernie.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.767
(sighs) So, a long time ago, Bernie

12:31.787 --> 12:34.352
was also in a school play,
just like this one.

12:34.388 --> 12:37.439
And he was so excited for it, but...

12:37.459 --> 12:39.524
he screwed around and
never learned his lines.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.916
Well, the the night of the play came,
and he forgot

12:41.936 --> 12:45.217
what he was supposed to say...

12:45.237 --> 12:47.282
and it ruined the play,

12:47.302 --> 12:50.165
and he was humiliated,
and that was the night

12:50.185 --> 12:52.436
his mom left his dad for
the local weatherman.

12:52.456 --> 12:55.407
So, if you would like your
mom and dad to stay married...

12:55.459 --> 12:56.612
Lina: Hey, Bernie!

12:56.632 --> 12:58.027
Maybe you should learn your goddamn lines.

12:58.047 --> 13:01.162
Bernie, from now on, you stay in character,
and I'll work with the actors, okay?

13:01.182 --> 13:03.550
Will, you, though?
Will you?

13:03.570 --> 13:06.205
Let's take five minutes. (Bernie sighs)

13:14.909 --> 13:16.261
- Hey.
- Hey...

13:16.346 --> 13:17.512
(laughs)

13:17.532 --> 13:22.400
Um... so... did you talk to Gil?

13:22.436 --> 13:24.436
- Oh...
- Are we quitting?

13:24.488 --> 13:26.271
I... I haven't had a chance.

13:26.323 --> 13:27.605
Do you think

13:27.658 --> 13:29.574
it'll happen before happy hour? (laughs)

13:29.609 --> 13:33.396
'Cause I'm getting ready to celebrate.

13:33.794 --> 13:34.952
I'm buying.

13:34.972 --> 13:38.571
Oh... in that case,
let met get on it. Let me get right to it.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.351
- Lina?
- Oh.

13:52.371 --> 13:54.215
I can't wait to see what you put together.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.468
- Oh, thank you.
- I don't think we've ever

13:56.553 --> 13:58.553
had a T.A. put on their own play before.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.271
It's very impressive.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.474
Um, I'm so sorry. Can I just...?

14:02.526 --> 14:04.309
Will you excuse me for one second?

14:04.361 --> 14:07.195
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Okay. Bye.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.314
Hey. Have you seen Russ?

14:09.399 --> 14:11.850
- He swore he was gonna be here.
- We have bigger problems.

14:12.396 --> 14:13.987
I can't find Farmer Todd.

14:14.007 --> 14:15.460
Shit.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.285
Come on.

14:25.561 --> 14:27.499
So, is it done?

14:27.551 --> 14:30.168
Are we ready to start
our new lives together?

14:30.220 --> 14:33.112
Uh... I, uh...

14:33.132 --> 14:34.556
I did talk to Gil.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.526
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um,

14:36.546 --> 14:38.511
things are, uh...

14:38.531 --> 14:40.484
they're not gonna...

14:40.504 --> 14:42.917
work out like we talked about.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.184
Okay...

14:46.236 --> 14:48.260
Which, I think, in the long run,

14:48.280 --> 14:50.238
is actually good, 'cause, uh,

14:50.323 --> 14:52.524
I don't know it's such a good idea

14:52.609 --> 14:55.410
that you and I, uh...

14:55.495 --> 14:59.164
work together anymore.

14:59.199 --> 15:03.005
Um... can... can I ask why?

15:03.025 --> 15:05.537
You're great. You really are.

15:05.622 --> 15:09.507
You know?
You're young, and you're beautiful.

15:09.765 --> 15:13.344
You are... exotic.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.547
Um...

15:15.567 --> 15:19.931
and I don't think you'll
have any trouble at all

15:20.171 --> 15:22.270
finding somebody else.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.556
What?! Oh, my God, no.

15:24.608 --> 15:26.391
I was just, like, excited about everything.

15:26.476 --> 15:29.227
- I know. I...
- I didn't mean it to turn into this.

15:29.312 --> 15:33.198
I mean, you did...
you did kind of, you know, sexually...?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.400
Are you kidding me? I don't love you.

15:35.485 --> 15:38.793
In fact, I kind of, like,
hate you right now.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.456
To be honest.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.541
So, you don't...?

15:43.932 --> 15:46.544
- No!
- Okay.

15:47.262 --> 15:49.164
- Okay.
- Sergio: Hey, hey.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.082
Russ. What up?

15:51.134 --> 15:52.467
So what's the verdict?

15:52.552 --> 15:55.420
Mike: Are you ready to have
your name on the vault?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.068
(sighs)

15:57.088 --> 15:59.573
Um...

15:59.593 --> 16:01.226
Oh, there he is.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.477
Excuse me.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.262
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:04.314 --> 16:06.231
- Oh, be careful.
- What's going on, Bernie?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.816
Lina: We're... we're-we're about to start.

16:09.712 --> 16:11.436
Oh, you feel that?

16:11.488 --> 16:14.189
That's a low-pressure system coming in.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.191
I think it's a Santa Ana.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.831
You see, Mommy, I know about the weather.

16:18.851 --> 16:21.496
Don't do this, man. Don't do it.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.414
I've never been to a farm.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.117
How am I supposed to play a farmer?

16:26.169 --> 16:27.321
(thudding, glass clinking)

16:27.341 --> 16:29.274
- What's up, boners?
- Lina: Oh, my God.

16:29.482 --> 16:31.884
You guys are ready to party?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.101
- Are you drunk?
- I am. Yes, right.

16:35.121 --> 16:36.906
- Jesus
- What?

16:36.926 --> 16:39.932
I was celebrating on account
of the fact that I just

16:39.952 --> 16:42.917
- saved the family.
- Saved the family? Saved from what?

16:42.937 --> 16:47.472
From me taking a lower-paying
job without health insurance.

16:47.557 --> 16:49.307
I had to do some, like,

16:49.392 --> 16:52.858
trick business stuff,
some double-crosses and switcheroos.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.331
And you want credit for that? No.

16:54.351 --> 16:57.262
I want credit for not banging my assistant.

16:57.282 --> 16:59.567
'Cause she was in love with me.

16:59.587 --> 17:02.320
Stop talking. Stay here. Guys...

17:02.340 --> 17:03.505
- it's showtime.
- Yeah.

17:03.525 --> 17:06.205
Okay, come on.
Bernie, that means you. Let's go.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.980
Mommy was right.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.990
I don't deserve love.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.381
So long, Broadway.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.165
(Lina sighs heavily)

17:30.013 --> 17:32.096
- Magnus...
- Howdy.

17:32.182 --> 17:33.815
About the play.

17:33.835 --> 17:37.058
So, it turns out that our
lead actor has come down

17:37.078 --> 17:40.104
with a very bad case of...

17:41.935 --> 17:43.325
of...

17:44.944 --> 17:48.524
Look, I think I like my job now,

17:48.544 --> 17:51.032
and I really don't want you to fire me.

17:51.117 --> 17:52.595
(switches clack)

17:53.277 --> 17:54.771
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:54.791 --> 17:56.305
boys and girls...

17:56.325 --> 17:57.784
- Oh, um...
- cows and pigs.

17:57.804 --> 17:59.236
Enjoy the show?

17:59.256 --> 18:02.493
Welcome to the world premiere of...

18:04.731 --> 18:07.099
Farmer Todd has a problem.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.167
Oh boy, oh boy.

18:09.298 --> 18:12.053
Does he have a problem.

18:12.073 --> 18:13.057
Maya: Farmer Todd?

18:13.077 --> 18:15.530
- Farmer Todd?
- Russ: Now?

18:15.550 --> 18:17.754
Yes!

18:18.228 --> 18:20.728
(audience murmuring)

18:20.814 --> 18:22.196
(sighs)

18:22.760 --> 18:24.789
Hey, give me that milk.

18:24.809 --> 18:26.333
You've had enough milk today.

18:26.353 --> 18:29.683
Uh, I will tell you when I've had enough.

18:29.703 --> 18:31.135
I'm worried about you.

18:31.155 --> 18:34.075
Well, yeah. Well...

18:34.160 --> 18:36.127
(belches)

18:36.212 --> 18:38.051
(laughter)

18:38.071 --> 18:41.165
AJ: All right, all right,
we all know burping is funny.

18:41.185 --> 18:43.207
But there are lots of
other things that happen

18:43.227 --> 18:45.514
when we drink too much,

18:45.534 --> 18:47.621
and they're not all funny, hmm?

18:47.641 --> 18:49.090
(door opens, shuts)

18:51.665 --> 18:54.871
You see, all the animals on the farm...
they love

18:54.891 --> 18:57.317
Farmer Todd, and when you love someone,

18:57.337 --> 19:00.405
you don't pretend that
they don't have a problem.

19:00.902 --> 19:03.071
You support them.

19:05.849 --> 19:07.158
(burping)

19:07.243 --> 19:09.004
(laughter)

19:09.383 --> 19:13.831
(piano playing, applause) And then the
sheep wiped away his tear, and said...

19:13.851 --> 19:17.313
And if you don't get help,
you're gonna die, because...

19:17.333 --> 19:21.122
ALL: Farmer Todd, you have a problem.

19:21.174 --> 19:23.174
(Lina laughs)

19:23.259 --> 19:25.960
(applause and cheering)

19:27.964 --> 19:29.965
(whooping)

19:29.985 --> 19:31.588
Well, thank you guys.

19:31.608 --> 19:33.329
Thank you so much. Hey, remember,

19:33.349 --> 19:34.598
just say no...

19:34.618 --> 19:37.202
no matter how good the cut is, okay?

19:37.222 --> 19:40.031
- Great job.
- Oh, my God. Hi.

19:40.051 --> 19:42.026
My parents loved the play.

19:42.112 --> 19:44.781
Very interesting. And entertaining.

19:44.801 --> 19:46.482
Thank you so much for coming.

19:46.502 --> 19:48.866
Abby insisted.

19:49.374 --> 19:51.068
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.547 --> 19:54.876
Um, did you guys know that

19:54.896 --> 19:59.456
AJ wrote the play based on
his own problems with alcohol?

19:59.476 --> 20:00.896
Oh!

20:00.916 --> 20:02.830
Well, that's great.

20:02.882 --> 20:04.999
AJ: Well, it's also

20:05.051 --> 20:07.084
about my problems with cocaine...

20:07.170 --> 20:08.836
- Mm-hmm.
- and laxatives.

20:13.176 --> 20:14.225
(Russ burps)

20:14.937 --> 20:16.227
(Russ groaning) Are you all right?

20:16.312 --> 20:18.305
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.274
- Is he okay?
- Yes.

20:24.795 --> 20:26.270
He has stage fright.

20:26.356 --> 20:29.023
Post-production stage fright.

20:29.305 --> 20:30.992
- Oh. Oh.
- Yeah.

20:31.027 --> 20:33.401
(Russ groans) Um, about the show.

20:33.421 --> 20:35.029
I'm sorry. I know

20:35.114 --> 20:36.914
- it was a little weird.
- I loved it.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.182
- You did?
- I-I did.

20:39.202 --> 20:43.204
Uh,
I know how it feels to be that little cow.

20:43.256 --> 20:45.923
I used to be that little cow.

20:46.009 --> 20:48.209
(Russ groaning) With my Nana.

20:50.213 --> 20:53.734
Anyway... amazing work.

20:53.754 --> 20:56.133
And I'm going to do everything I can

20:56.153 --> 21:00.021
to bring you back here next year, okay?

21:00.056 --> 21:01.939
(groaning) Okay. Okay.

21:02.025 --> 21:03.941
Oh!

21:03.961 --> 21:05.878
(sighs)

21:05.898 --> 21:07.506
Hmm.

21:08.151 --> 21:09.479
Ugh.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.655
Did I save the family again?

21:11.675 --> 21:13.501
- No.
- Oh.

21:13.521 --> 21:15.987
What you did out there? Mm-hmm.

21:16.072 --> 21:18.039
That was Broadway level shit.

21:18.074 --> 21:18.589
(both laugh)

21:18.609 --> 21:20.860
It was. It was awesome.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.511
You know what?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.212
I'm starting to get it.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.130
What?

21:26.216 --> 21:29.716
Why your assistant fell in love with you.

21:29.736 --> 21:33.069
Yeah. That... didn't really happen.

21:33.089 --> 21:34.255
I know.

21:34.340 --> 21:37.310
But I was cool letting you think it did.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.093
You're the best.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.845
No, no.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.704
Let's... let's just high five.

21:42.724 --> 21:43.721
Why?

21:43.741 --> 21:45.757
Farmer Todd needs a mint.

21:45.777 --> 21:47.432
- What?! No.
- Yeah.

21:47.452 --> 21:50.287
- Like a Listerine strip.
- How about nothing?

21:50.460 --> 21:51.921
(laughing) Get off of me!

21:51.941 --> 21:54.568
You're so gross! Ew! (laughs)
