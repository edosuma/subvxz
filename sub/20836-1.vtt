01:32.676 --> 01:34.495
God almighty.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.689
That man's shot to death.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.125
I wonder what he done.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.877
Well, whatever it was,
somebody didn't like it.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.354
That's for sure.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.860
Help me, boys.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.722
Save me.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.074
Hide me.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.876
Don't take too damn long about it,
'cause I'm going fast.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.650
We can get in terrible trouble.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.444
He's right, you know.
It ain't none of our business.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.279
But if we don't do something,
he's bound to die.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.632
That's right, sonny.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.079
I'm on my way to meet my maker.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.601
And I ain't ready for him.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.285
I don't want to touch him.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.280
Is this your farm?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.365
Yes, I own it.

04:58.465 --> 05:02.119
Did you see anybody unfamiliar
pass this way yesterday or today?

05:02.219 --> 05:03.892
No, I've seen nobody.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.290
You, boy?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.391
No, sir.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.237
We got a mean one loose.
Watch out for him.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.281
Kindly ride clear of my flower bed.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.579
Watch the geraniums, boys.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.015
One, two, three.
All here and accounted for.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.267
Good evening, boys.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.393
Good evening.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.836
Thank you.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.191
It's nice to see you.

06:56.291 --> 07:01.029
I've been sitting up here all day
staring down that cow's behind till I'm sick.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.302
What's in the pail tonight?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.242
Rabbit.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.686
Hey, that'll slip right down.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.465
Your ma sure knows what to do
with a rabbit.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.425
My ma's dead.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.027
I cooked it.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.953
I got something for you, too.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.417
Why, there must be a couple of dollars
in here.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.405
Did you save it, or did you lift it?

07:43.505 --> 07:44.631
I saved it.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.826
You're gonna need it, mister.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.453
We went through your pockets,
and you ain't got nothing in them.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.499
I got a money belt, boys,
underneath my pants.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.044
With over a $1,000 of gold in them.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.772
You better save this for a rainy day.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.911
I noticed some lace on this bandage.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.806
Who's petticoat did it come off of,

08:09.906 --> 08:12.559
and was the lady still in it
when you took it?

08:12.659 --> 08:15.663
No, them's just curtains from my attic.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.667
Well, what do I owe you boys?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.485
How do you mean?

08:22.585 --> 08:25.947
Food, keep, patchwork, how much?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.720
We didn't figure to charge you, mister.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.243
Well, you could get plenty.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.163
There's a price on my head, boys.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.666
$500 in Texas, $600 in Oklahoma,

08:36.765 --> 08:38.643
and $1,000 in Arkansas.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.070
Who are you, mister?

08:41.604 --> 08:45.008
The name's Spikes, Harry Spikes.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.610
I'm a bank robber, boys.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.805
Bank robber?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.934
That's right, sonny. That's how
I got my ass shot up this time

08:54.034 --> 08:55.251
and 20 times before.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.438
If they caught you, would they hang you?

08:58.538 --> 08:59.790
No.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.070
They'd cut off my head and stick it
on a telegraph pole as a warning.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.697
Like they done to a couple
friends of mine.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.471
Well, then, how come you stick with it?

09:11.301 --> 09:15.556
Well, I got five Mexican ladies
waiting for me in five different towns.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.417
And I got a dozen shirts
all handmade out of pure silk.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.836
Every color of the rainbow.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.110
And the leather in my boots
is as soft as butter.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.720
That's 'cause Indian ladies chew them
before they sew them.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.097
And I got bonded bourbon whiskey

09:32.197 --> 09:36.168
and a box of Havana cigars by my bed
every time I lay my head down.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.376
And that's only when things are slack.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.775
But you're sleeping on a hay bale now.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.194
Nothing's perfect.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.407
Well, boys, come tomorrow, I'll be gone.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.993
So it's time I made my manners.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.579
You got my eternal
and ever-lasting gratitude.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.125
I know that ain't much in the light
of what you done for me,

10:00.225 --> 10:02.293
but you remember this.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.754
Harry Spike's your man.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.401
I owe you.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.010
Anytime.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.095
Any place.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.822
In any way.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.138
I didn't see your horse stabled.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.098
I didn't put him in tonight.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.309
No, why is that?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.061
I forgot.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.563
Your mind was on other things?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.939
I guess.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.941
That's your responsibility.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.527
If you've finished your supper,
we'll go look for him.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.653
No, I can do it.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.676
We'll go together.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.594
It would seem he's wandered off.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.514
- Did you tether him?
- Yes.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.226
Well, maybe he's slipped loose.
Call to him.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.124
Why don't you call?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.361
There's no sign of him.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.030
Is it possible he was stolen?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.366
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.845
I'll ask you for a second time.
Where is your horse?

12:01.304 --> 12:02.622
He's mine.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.666
I worked for him. I earned him.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.459
I'm not questioning that.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.212
You work to the limit of your strength,
and you don't complain.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.881
But there are other things
in your character that grieve me.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.717
You disobey. You resist me.
You're not open with me.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.553
Now where's your horse?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.804
I gave him to somebody.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.766
Was it that fugitive,
that thief and murderer?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.852
Yes. Yes, I did.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.603
So you lied.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.313
To the posse and to me.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.316
And you stole clothing and food.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.278
Do you understand what you've done?
Do you see yourself as I see you?

12:33.378 --> 12:36.990
Revealed in every sin
of which you're capable.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.076
You've tried my sufferance and God's.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.598
Who comes first, Father?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.144
You just up and left?

14:30.244 --> 14:31.729
That's right.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.923
I took the last licking I can take
without killing him.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.526
You got any back left?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.299
No, he didn't leave much.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.780
What'll you do?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.824
I don't know.
I'll turn up something or other.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.785
You ain't never been
any further than the next town.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.037
The world don't end there.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.980
I suppose it don't.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.543
You know,

14:53.643 --> 14:55.712
I wouldn't mind going with ya.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.486
My daddy's mistook me
for a mule for some time now.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.994
Well, I'll write ya
as soon as I light someplace.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.099
It's gonna be kind
of lonesome around here.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.826
Don't back into any pitchforks.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.211
Don't roll out of bed.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.966
Goodbye.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.826
You mean you're really going for good?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.724
I won't be back this way again.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.334
I wish I was coming.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.857
No, you better not get mixed up in it.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.693
You were gonna teach me
to swim this summer.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.322
Just hold your nose
and jump off the bank.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.823
We've always been together.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.051
It's us.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.779
Well, I can see it's you.
What are you up to?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.473
Why should you have all the fun?

16:30.573 --> 16:33.476
I'd just as soon be
where both of you are at.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.769
Did you bring clean underwear?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.668
No, gonna let this one set ripen.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.651
Okay, we'll do it.
We'll throw in together.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.821
And by God, the one thing we won't
ever do is kiss no man's boot!

16:44.921 --> 16:46.138
You bet!

16:47.423 --> 16:48.616
Let's go get lucky!

16:48.716 --> 16:50.993
Wait a minute. Where are we going?

16:51.093 --> 16:53.437
Hell, I don't know! Anywhere!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.239
What do you want?

17:28.339 --> 17:31.701
We was wondering if we could do you
some chores in exchange for a dollar?

17:31.801 --> 17:35.288
Swill your pigs, clean out your barn,
whatever. You say.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.688
You can scat.
I don't hire saddle tramps.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.043
Ain't you heard, lady?

17:41.143 --> 17:45.489
Money's like manure.
It's only good when you spread it around.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.940
There's lunch.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.568
No, I ain't come to that just yet.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.262
You always was a finicky eater, Will.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.794
What you're doing is a terrible sin.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.192
You're eating the body
and the blood of Christ.

18:27.607 --> 18:32.033
Tod, tonight this ain't nothing
but crackers and elderberry wine.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.540
Is that gonna be breakfast?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.960
It's breakfast, lunch and supper.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.586
I sure am hungry.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.215
Well, drink some more.
It'll fill you up.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.717
Haven't we got a dime between us?

19:11.817 --> 19:15.071
- No, not a one.
- Money don't even know we're alive.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.558
You could sell your watch.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.102
His daddy give him that watch.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.772
Yeah, but it's solid gold.
It'd bring a fistful of money.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.941
Come on, don't you ever want to sit down
in front of a plate again?

19:27.041 --> 19:30.278
Don't you understand nothing?
He don't want to let that go.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.925
Hey, you.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.556
Get up.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.585
You ain't from around here.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.780
I know you ain't, 'cause I know every man,
dog and mule for 50 miles.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.215
That's a wide acquaintance.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.068
You're a pretty funny boy.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.637
Where you from?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.364
Down the road a piece.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.767
"Down the road a piece," huh?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.269
Boys, if there's one thing
that riles my ass,

20:03.369 --> 20:04.520
it's the sight of three high-smelling,

20:04.620 --> 20:07.523
down at the heels egg-suckers
on these quiet streets.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.526
Now what's your business here?
Don't get fresh answering.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.777
We're just passing through.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.987
You sure are.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.055
I reckon five minutes
would be about right.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.450
Five minutes from when?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.894
Five minutes
from the time you got into town.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.648
Well, we might need 10.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.501
My friend here has to use
a public convenience.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.086
Don't sass me, you little bastards.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.484
You ain't calling me that,
mister, are you?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.874
You get going.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.634
Friendly folks around here.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.569
We better move on like he said.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.906
Move where? On what? We're broke.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.075
Mr. Spikes is never broke.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.535
He's never hungry either.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.871
What made you think
of him all of a sudden?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.814
Looking at that bank.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.210
You know what he'd do
if he was in our shoes?

21:09.310 --> 21:12.922
He'd walk in that bank,
pull out his gun, and say,

21:13.022 --> 21:16.092
"It's all baloney, so slice me some."

21:16.192 --> 21:18.052
That's stealing!

21:18.152 --> 21:20.280
It's better than starving.

21:57.066 --> 22:00.136
I'm not going to shoot you, mister.
I just want all the money you got in here.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.637
I want it all, and I want it quick.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.015
Everything's in the safe.
Works on a time clock.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.335
- Well, how long before it goes off?
- 9:00.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.023
I'll wait for it.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.151
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone crazy?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.652
- Maybe.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.320
That sheriff's two steps away.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.989
You two go if you want to,
but I'm staying put.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.032
Let go of it, Will.
This here is deep water.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.226
I'm going whole hog!

22:25.386 --> 22:30.233
All right, if you're gonna be in trouble,
I guess I'm gonna be in trouble.

23:03.674 --> 23:04.825
It's 9:00, mister.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.036
That clock could be a might fast.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.162
And you could be lying.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.499
It's gonna go off any second.
Don't get excited, son.

23:11.599 --> 23:12.792
Any second now.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.543
It better, mister.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.670
There's still time, son.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.340
- For what?
- To think what you're doing.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.926
To think where it will get you.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.075
I've set the house on fire.
Let it smoke.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.792
Tod, get behind the door
in case somebody comes in. Les!

23:45.341 --> 23:47.343
I don't even believe it.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.017
Wait. Just take the small ones.
They're safer.

23:52.681 --> 23:56.026
You must be getting tired, mister.
You can put your hands down.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.257
Hey, Bobby Ray, you seen anything
of three young desert rats?

24:01.357 --> 24:02.904
Yeah, I've seen them.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.362
Damnation.

24:18.624 --> 24:22.278
Boy, you gonna have men hunting
you down for this till the day you die.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.348
Stuff you cap in his mouth, Tod.
Shut him up.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.136
Okay, open up.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.059
Open wide.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.101
Now get back. Get Back.

24:47.945 --> 24:51.348
Don't hurry on for us.
We'd like a little jump.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.560
What are you up to?
What are you doing here?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.162
Hey!

25:07.006 --> 25:09.475
They're gonna be on us. Hurry up.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.270
Stop them! Stop them!

25:25.816 --> 25:28.160
Les, Will, I'm down!

25:41.999 --> 25:43.842
- The money!
- Don't stop!

26:08.108 --> 26:11.908
We're all right now.
I think we just crossed the Rio Grande.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.848
I think we're in Mexico.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.058
Look here.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.895
A bullet took a lock of hair off me
right behind my ear.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.106
I've got blood on my shirt.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.066
That man fell against you.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.464
Got hold of me around my neck.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.073
I never killed nothing in my whole life.
I never even killed a rabbit.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.450
Tod, it was an accident.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.370
That doesn't matter. He's dead!

26:36.470 --> 26:39.599
To God and all of God's world forever.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.486
I ought to go back and give myself up.
I'm the one that did it.

26:50.192 --> 26:54.197
Well, if we gotta answer,
we'll all answer together.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.807
Maybe we ought to go
join up with the army.

27:14.383 --> 27:19.038
The law wouldn't look the other way
just 'cause we come in to join up.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.790
At least they'd feed you
three times a day.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.127
I heard the railroad pays good wages
if you're laying line.

27:25.227 --> 27:28.071
They won't take you
if you ain't Chinese.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.426
Anyway, it's back on the other side.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.304
What are we gonna do then, Will,
besides run?

27:35.404 --> 27:37.702
I don't know.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.852
We'll light on something.

27:41.952 --> 27:44.438
Well, one thing for sure,

27:44.538 --> 27:47.257
I can't die any poorer than I started.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.184
Guess he's living over yesterday.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.600
I wish we had it back again.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.113
Lady, our pockets is just as empty
as our bellies.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.406
No.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.001
Tod. Tod.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.775
Get back. Give him some air.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.970
It ain't nothing serious.
He's just hollow.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.882
Mister, that was
my grandfather's timepiece.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.259
He gave it to me on his death bed.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.596
It's 18 karat gold,
and it ain't lost a minute in 30 years.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.040
How much can you give me for it?

29:45.158 --> 29:47.269
A hundred.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.021
Dollars or pesos?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.772
Pesos, señor.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.091
That ain't but $10.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.614
Mister, I robbed a bank.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.558
I'm still not as big a bandit as you.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.256
I don't know why he's so friendly
when I'm probably eating his brother.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.718
Better stoke up
while it lasts for a while.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.822
It isn't so bad really
if you don't get your nose too close.

31:07.449 --> 31:10.168
You have come to the proper place.

31:14.790 --> 31:18.636
Will, I don't know what it is,
but we must be doing something wrong.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.998
Is he asleep again?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.475
Yeah, he is.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.189
He slept all day yesterday.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.654
I know he did.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.529
He don't do nothing but sleep anymore.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.559
Tod.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.161
Tod, wake up.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.521
Tod, you gotta eat something.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.565
I don't want anything.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.358
You're gonna lose your strength
for when we get out of here.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.568
Come on and eat.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.653
We're never gonna get out of here.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.597
I'm beginning to wonder
about that myself, Will.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.825
It's been eight weeks.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.019
Ain't we're ever gonna get up
in front of a judge?

32:10.679 --> 32:13.040
Could be he doesn't come by
but once a year.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.500
Like back home.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.087
Maybe we could say we was Catholics
and ask to see a priest.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.564
Maybe he'd help us out.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.219
No, Catholics can smell out
a Baptist right off.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.447
Then they won't have
nothing to do with 'em.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.232
Yeah, they got a big church, all right.

32:39.332 --> 32:42.027
Did you ever notice that
when they open that big door,

32:42.127 --> 32:45.176
the altar piece they got over there
is made of gold?

32:48.300 --> 32:49.910
Mr. Spikes!

32:50.010 --> 32:51.703
Mr. Spikes! Mr. Spikes!

32:51.803 --> 32:53.622
- Mr. Spikes! Hey!
- Mr. Spikes!

32:53.722 --> 32:55.082
Mr. Spikes!

32:55.182 --> 32:56.375
- Mr. Spikes!
- Mr. Spikes!

32:56.475 --> 32:58.443
Mr. Spikes! Over here!

33:01.146 --> 33:02.339
Mr. Spikes!

33:02.439 --> 33:04.157
Mr. Spikes!

33:08.778 --> 33:12.408
Well, well, well, three birds in a cage.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.651
You sure come along
in the nick of time, Mr. Spikes.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.152
We was just about cooked.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.321
Me with running sores,
and him with dysentery,

33:26.421 --> 33:27.906
and him with ticks eating him alive.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.200
How'd you ever get us loose, Mr. Spikes?

33:30.300 --> 33:34.579
Why, I rolled a $100 bill around a good cigar
and put another one in my handshake.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.831
I don't know how we'll ever repay you.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.499
I'll get you in a poker game some day,

33:37.599 --> 33:41.149
but meanwhile, boys,
you'll better coming after a bath.

33:52.989 --> 33:56.143
So you went and robbed
yourself a bank, did you?

33:56.243 --> 33:58.854
Killed a man and lost the money.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.857
Don't look like you boys
got the gift for it.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.609
Well, I guess it's done,
and it can't be undone.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.695
No way I know of.

34:06.795 --> 34:10.157
Hell, two days after
they buried the man,

34:10.257 --> 34:13.909
The Louisville Courier-Gazette
wrote a poem about you boys.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.556
Had 15 verses.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.373
Read like this.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.127
"Three country boys, each one a knave

34:22.226 --> 34:25.572
"slew a state senator
and sent him to his grave."

34:26.815 --> 34:28.717
Sold a lot of papers.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.969
That man we killed was a state senator?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.888
That's right, son.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.286
Friend to widows and orphans.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.129
You brought down a big one, boys.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.732
There's a bounty on you.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.943
They don't care
whether you're cold or warm.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.172
They'll pay $1,500 for each one of you.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.408
That makes us sitting ducks, don't it?

34:53.507 --> 34:55.076
Not knowing which way
we're gonna get flushed.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.849
That's the game.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.081
Sure didn't mean nothing
like this to come of it.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.626
We didn't desire to commit murder.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.273
It just kind of ran away from us.

35:04.728 --> 35:09.029
Well, we all started out something else
way back.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.203
What would you do
if you was us, Mr. Spikes?

35:15.697 --> 35:17.682
Lie close.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.851
Keep your boots by your bed.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.312
Sit up quick when a dog barks.

35:22.412 --> 35:25.006
Go out but little,
make no acquaintances.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.693
Have nothing peculiar
about your manner or dress.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.387
And above all, never talk.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.430
It's the talking man gets caught.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.456
Don't look so scared, boys.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.524
Hell, look at me.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.337
Madelia, Northfield,

35:47.437 --> 35:50.215
Jonesboro, Elysian Township,

35:50.315 --> 35:52.926
Marysville, Gallatin.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.371
I ducked late a few times,
but I'm still standing.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.308
The thing to do, my friends,

36:00.408 --> 36:03.979
is submit to your fate
with Christian resignation

36:04.079 --> 36:07.128
and live bravely
till your appointed time.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.912
Bring the boys whatever you got left
that's fat and juicy.

36:21.012 --> 36:25.188
And if you don't have anything cooked,
bring them a hind quarter raw.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.838
I'd like you to keep track
of what your spending, Mr. Spikes.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.173
We'll make good on it as soon as we can.

36:32.273 --> 36:35.493
Don't worry about it.
I'll carry you for a while.

36:38.822 --> 36:42.309
Well, you boys left the farm,
and you had some trouble.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.352
You seen some of the world.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.895
How do you find it?

36:45.995 --> 36:50.191
We ain't really seen that much of it.
Just been chased through it.

36:50.291 --> 36:53.737
Well, you're still better off
than most people.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.906
Most people are tied
to one thing and one place.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.659
They eat, work, and die doing it.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.454
Don't seem to bother them.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.683
But I say, "Break off a bigger hunk.
Come what may."

37:06.641 --> 37:08.609
You, Jackson.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.219
You damn fool! I don't even know you!

37:18.319 --> 37:20.847
Jesus, God!
I thought you were someone else.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.515
He's been looking
for somebody all night.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.558
Well, he's found him.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.393
No, sir! It's just a mistake.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.021
Let him off. He's dead drunk.

37:28.121 --> 37:31.566
Hell, we just come down from Eagle Pass
to have us a good time.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.069
I'm middle-aged, and I'm tired of fools.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.171
Make sure the next time.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.348
Let's go.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.301
Don't you think
we ought to find you a doctor?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.428
I doctor myself.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.781
This will scab up by morning.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.868
Feels like I walked through barbed wire.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.647
That whiskey-soaked son of a bitch.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.024
I thought you were going to kill him.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.318
Did you, son?

38:15.418 --> 38:18.137
Well, I'm more careful than you think.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.256
Why the hell should I pay
good money for it?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.984
I'll get it free one of these days.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.349
I'm going to a whorehouse now, boys,

38:46.449 --> 38:49.794
to take my mind off my aches and pains,
so I'm sending you to bed.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.480
Now here's a dollar apiece.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.649
Get yourself a room
up at the Grand National Hotel

38:54.749 --> 38:56.276
on the second floor.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.925
The cockroaches don't crawl that high.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.601
Them cowboys are still in town.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.662
Maybe we should stick with him
for a while.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.373
I don't think he'd like that.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.817
Well, he doesn't have to see us.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.530
Good morning, boys.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.687
Morning, Mr. Spikes.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.148
- Morning.
- You're up pretty early.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.191
Yes, sir.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.859
Just get here?

39:37.959 --> 39:40.803
No, we've been sleeping here
most of the night.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.700
Well, we was a little worried
about those cowboys from Eagle Pass.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.993
Is that right?

39:47.093 --> 39:48.561
Well, there was 10 of them.

39:50.471 --> 39:53.395
Well, I thank you
for keeping an eye on me.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.993
Come on. I'll buy you breakfast.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.582
You can go down anytime
in this business.

40:17.498 --> 40:22.403
Could be a man in a nice broadcloth coat
just stepping of a train,

40:22.503 --> 40:24.823
picking cherries off a tree,

40:24.923 --> 40:28.743
tipping his hat
and bidding good morning to you.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.579
Any one of them can have your ticket.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.148
This is the mayor and his wife.

40:41.022 --> 40:44.259
He don't talk to me, but I nod to him.

40:44.359 --> 40:47.637
Well, young gentlemen,
it's time for me to say adiós.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.265
You're out of jail,
and your bellies are full.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.059
You did me a good turn once,
and I'm not ungrateful.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.894
I've enjoyed your company.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.564
I hope you can say the same for me.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.107
Won't we be seeing you
again, Mr. Spikes?

40:59.207 --> 41:02.882
Not likely. I have business
to attend to. This is goodbye.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.658
We sure do appreciate everything
you've done for us.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.119
Take care of yourself, Mr. Spikes.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.392
Don't roll out of bed.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.668
He sure was friendly.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.736
Yeah, he sure was.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.259
Hard at it, boys.

42:50.359 --> 42:53.137
Why, hello there, Mr. Spikes.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.806
Smells of garbage in there.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.015
Yes, sir, it does.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.810
You've settled on dish washing
for your life's work?

42:58.910 --> 43:01.229
No, this is our last day here.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.189
The lady told us not to come back.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.192
Yeah, we've busted
a few too many of her plates.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.652
What you got lined up next?

43:07.752 --> 43:10.989
Well, we figured to hire
on to dig holes.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.241
That's what prairie dogs do.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.220
Well, it's that or go without supper.

43:17.178 --> 43:20.057
Take off those damned aprons
and come along.

43:39.826 --> 43:44.480
Boys, I'm going to be your deliverance
and salvation.

43:44.580 --> 43:47.692
Now don't ask me why I'm doing it.
It don't make no sense.

43:47.792 --> 43:51.779
God knows I could get a dozen better
on any saloon down the street.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.382
But you got some spirit,
and you got some craw.

43:55.091 --> 43:58.015
Where I come from, you harness a mule,

43:59.303 --> 44:02.331
but you give a horse a chance to run.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.355
How would you boys like
to throw in with me?

44:11.607 --> 44:14.677
It means goodbye to our folks,
and our home and all that.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.221
Yeah, but it's that way now, Tod.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.575
Well, one thing's for sure,
we'd get noticed.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.230
We'll come in with you, Mr. Spikes.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.066
- Thanks very much.
- Good.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.383
Now, let's see if you can shoot.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.339
This ain't too bad.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.592
Okay, here's some shirts. Hey.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.989
Look out. Here's some shirts.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.268
Well, boys, how you feeling?

46:27.368 --> 46:29.020
This tug is just so new and stiff

46:29.120 --> 46:32.982
I don't think I van do anything
except sit bolt upright in a chair.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.359
The ladies in this town are going
to whinny, prance and kick

46:35.459 --> 46:36.927
just at the sight of you three.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.890
Hold it. Hold it a minute.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.165
Go ahead. Pull her out.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.079
He's right.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.273
Rotten to the core.

47:34.226 --> 47:37.571
I'd never let him do that to me
without laughing gas.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.926
Why, he's the same doctor
that took out my appendix

47:42.026 --> 47:44.495
with only a quart and a half of tequila.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.961
What do you think, boys? Solid gold.

47:54.455 --> 47:58.359
Now, the side door is about 35 feet
from the front door.

47:58.459 --> 48:01.654
Les, you'll come in this way.
Me and Will will go in through the front.

48:01.754 --> 48:06.075
Now, once inside,
the teller stands here,

48:06.175 --> 48:08.286
and generally, the guard over here.

48:08.386 --> 48:11.872
They've got gold brick, but it's too heavy
for the horses, so we'll leave it.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.166
They keep the money
in the vault back here.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.877
But they've got some cash
in the drawer up front.

48:16.977 --> 48:18.587
So while it ain't generally much,
we'll take it.

48:18.687 --> 48:19.714
'Cause it'll aid the cause.

48:19.814 --> 48:21.882
What if they just don't wanna
give it to us?

48:21.982 --> 48:24.343
Then they're dead men for sure.

48:24.443 --> 48:28.889
Remember, boys,
there's no arrest or trial for this crime.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.725
Only convictions.

48:30.825 --> 48:32.893
Now, Tod, we can't have
you standing around outside,

48:32.993 --> 48:35.396
looking generally unemployed,
holding a bunch of horses.

48:35.496 --> 48:38.274
So, four minutes after we leave,
you take off with the horses,

48:38.374 --> 48:40.234
and you'll meet us
just as we're coming out.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.757
- You got the watch?
- Yes, sir.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.324
Good.

48:46.424 --> 48:49.035
I know you boys will be plucky
and do your job.

48:49.135 --> 48:51.012
Okay, I'll be on time.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.645
Let's give it a try.

49:47.526 --> 49:51.013
There's one other thing we ain't discussed
about bank-robbing, boys.

49:51.113 --> 49:53.474
This is a good time as any.

49:53.574 --> 49:56.018
If one of us should get caught
in a trap,

49:56.118 --> 49:58.813
he's got to hang rather than talk.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.415
Remember that.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.740
All right, you boys'll do for this job.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.659
Mr. Spikes?

50:11.759 --> 50:13.452
Ain't we gonna take that bank?

50:13.552 --> 50:16.601
Why, no, boys. I keep my own money
in that bank.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.542
This ain't a bit bad, Mr. Spikes.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.235
I'm a good cook.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.630
I learned from my wife.

51:06.730 --> 51:07.715
You was married?

51:07.815 --> 51:09.341
Oh, yes.

51:09.441 --> 51:11.193
To a wonderful lady.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.030
A school teacher.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.934
She could talk in French.

51:19.034 --> 51:20.561
She played the piano.

51:20.661 --> 51:22.938
She sang in a fine and sweet voice.

51:23.038 --> 51:25.149
You don't say?

51:25.249 --> 51:27.902
That lady made a man out of me.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.154
She taught me everything.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.989
How to read and write.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.533
How to pull up to a table.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.852
How to use a spoon and a fork.

51:38.387 --> 51:40.389
I loved that woman.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.725
What become of her, Mr. Spikes?

51:43.684 --> 51:45.186
I killed her.

51:48.897 --> 51:50.695
In another man's bed.

52:13.714 --> 52:14.886
Wilson.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.389
Sit here before me.

52:26.185 --> 52:29.046
- Wilson.
- Yes, Pa.

52:29.146 --> 52:31.298
You ran off from home.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.383
Yes, sir.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.426
Why did you go away?

52:34.526 --> 52:36.929
One thing leads to another, Father.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.681
You've broken the law.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.141
You've corrupted and tainted our blood.

52:41.241 --> 52:44.478
I'm doing the best I can
with what I've got.

52:44.578 --> 52:45.938
How will it end?

52:46.038 --> 52:47.648
I don't know.

52:47.748 --> 52:50.693
Something's bound to happen.
Something's bound to.

52:50.793 --> 52:53.779
How can I call you my son any longer?

52:53.879 --> 52:55.927
How can I acknowledge you?

52:56.632 --> 52:57.658
Wait.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.010
You'll be cold.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.937
You're cold now.

53:02.513 --> 53:03.831
Wait!

53:03.931 --> 53:05.023
Wait!

53:42.302 --> 53:45.372
We'll cross back into the US
about two miles down.

53:45.472 --> 53:48.125
Now, Uvalde's a dandy little town.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.210
The bank there's got
lots of money in it.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.129
It's an easy place
to get away from, too.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.464
Don't it have a sheriff?

53:53.564 --> 53:55.924
Why, sure, an old one.

53:56.024 --> 53:58.302
He's got a deputy that's even older.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.700
Two old men just gumming their food.

54:02.281 --> 54:04.558
Why, we'll open up that bank
like a can of peaches.

54:04.658 --> 54:06.501
Hot dog!

54:07.661 --> 54:09.789
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

54:13.208 --> 54:16.612
You know, when I first met you boys,
you were a sober bunch.

54:16.712 --> 54:19.636
There was no mischief in you,
no day-dreaming.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.844
Nothing but old before your time.

54:24.052 --> 54:27.831
Well, you make the music, Mr. Spikes,
and we'll dance to it.

54:27.931 --> 54:31.231
Hey! Hey! Hey!

54:45.365 --> 54:46.600
Well, there she is, boys.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.352
Just down the street from the bridge,

54:48.452 --> 54:50.500
the Cattlemen's Bank of Uvalde.

54:51.163 --> 54:53.565
How much money do you think they got
in there, Mr. Spikes?

54:53.665 --> 54:54.775
Well, I was there myself

54:54.875 --> 54:58.904
when Mr. J. P. Calhoun
deposited $20,000 in species.

54:59.004 --> 55:01.098
That'll buy you a haircut
and a shave, son.

55:08.722 --> 55:11.625
Why don't we just go on in
and clean it out right now, Mr. Spikes?

55:11.725 --> 55:14.378
No, we'll wait till Saturday.
They'll have more money then.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.922
That's when they open
the vault for payday.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.758
Show a little patience, boys.

55:19.858 --> 55:23.011
We'll make camp. Then I'll go in tonight
and scout around a little.

55:23.111 --> 55:25.079
See how it all lays out.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.987
You think that bank's
gonna be hard work?

55:40.087 --> 55:43.699
I guess we're putting our heads
in the lion's mouth all right.

55:43.799 --> 55:46.427
I just hope we can take it out again.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.601
You got any kind of religion, Les?

55:52.933 --> 55:56.003
I sort of always thought
of old Johnny God as being a big,

55:56.103 --> 55:59.357
bald-headed man
with whiskers and a temper.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.634
How about you?

56:02.734 --> 56:06.034
Well, if there's a hell,
I'd like to keep out of it.

56:09.324 --> 56:11.643
What you got there?

56:11.743 --> 56:13.896
It's a letter.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.481
If anything happens,

56:15.581 --> 56:18.901
I want one of you two
to see that my mom gets it.

56:19.001 --> 56:20.253
What'd you say in it?

56:24.590 --> 56:25.842
"Dear Ma,

56:27.009 --> 56:29.036
"I'm getting along fine.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.580
"Eating good and sleeping good.

56:31.680 --> 56:36.543
"I've took up with good company,
and every day has something new in it.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.921
"I'm leading a different kind
of life than I led at home,

56:39.021 --> 56:42.716
"with plenty of excitement
and adventure, which appeals to me.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.194
"Every nickel I make is clear gain.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.223
"The reason I'm writing this letter is

56:49.323 --> 56:53.310
"I'm going into a desperate enterprise
in a day or two.

56:53.410 --> 56:57.356
"If you don't think I've been
a good son, I'm sorry for it.

56:57.456 --> 56:59.900
"Tell that to Pa, too.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.844
"I hope Cissie is growing up
and all right.

57:04.129 --> 57:07.178
"Goodbye, Momma,
if I never see you again."

57:22.189 --> 57:24.191
How come you boys ain't looking lively?

57:24.858 --> 57:27.202
How come you don't post a guard?

57:29.404 --> 57:31.598
While you're sitting here by the fire
toasting your toes,

57:31.698 --> 57:33.392
anybody could have walked right in

57:33.492 --> 57:36.728
and plant a big juicy kiss on your cheek

57:36.828 --> 57:38.876
or send you off to a long sleep.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.299
Guess it was kind of dumb.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.505
Live and learn.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.777
Things is quiet in town.

58:02.187 --> 58:05.066
They ain't expecting
a wild bunch like us.

58:06.733 --> 58:08.735
Now you boys don't drink,

58:10.320 --> 58:12.072
and you don't smoke.

58:15.742 --> 58:18.712
So I brought you a bag of cinnamon buns.

58:21.331 --> 58:23.333
Pretty widow makes them.

58:30.757 --> 58:33.101
Now I'm gonna get myself drunk.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.832
If I can just get my head empty,

58:38.932 --> 58:41.355
then the true answers come to me.

58:42.602 --> 58:45.172
I'd appreciate it
if you'd compose me for sleep.

58:45.272 --> 58:48.634
Take off my boots
when you think I'm ready.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.782
I'll say good night, boys.

58:58.493 --> 59:00.187
We're being watched.

59:00.287 --> 59:01.521
What?

59:01.621 --> 59:03.774
Somebody's up there looking down.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.797
Stay with your coffee.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.237
- Well, who do you think it is?
- No idea.

59:09.337 --> 59:11.214
Hello, down there!

59:13.425 --> 59:15.803
Well, come on down. We got coffee.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.479
Don't do nothing rash.

59:49.669 --> 59:51.012
Take a cup.

59:56.051 --> 59:58.053
I hope it's fresh cooked.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.192
Ain't you got a cinnamon bun
to go with this?

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:10.966
This ain't no restaurant, old fella.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.801
Where you from?

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.428
Just from town.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:17.472
- And what town would that be?
- Why, Uvalde.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.766
Didn't know there was any others around.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.961
We wouldn't know.
We're just riding through.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:27.875
It's a pretty big slug of ashes
just for one campfire.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.027
What's your name?

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.070
Got a lot of names.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.907
Billy Blanco, Kid White. Take your pick.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.909
Why, I've heard of you.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:39.745
You put a few in Boot Hill, haven't you?

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.455
Two or three rows.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.104
Yeah. Took some from behind, I heard.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.398
That's right, brother,
if that's the way they was facing.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.569
What do you want of us?

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.033
I want in.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:57.241
We ain't got nothing working.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.848
Shit, Harry.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.621
I spotted you in town.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.708
Then I come out here,
and I see these three pups.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:11.047
And damned if they ain't wanted
for killin' a senator in Carrizo Springs.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.653
So?

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:17.098
So I figure that you're
after that bank in Uvalde.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.118
I'm inviting myself in.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.595
I'm pulling that job with you.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.415
You smell of liniment
and old pee, Billy.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.751
Why don't you drag your ass
upon a porch somewhere,

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.525
and eat your mush, and let
your grandchildren take care of ya?

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.799
What we got is beyond you.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.051
You'll come to it.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.245
There's grizzle in your beard, too.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.701
Finish your coffee and ride on out.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:45.310
I ain't asking for a regular share.
I'll take a half a share.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.603
I'll take less than that.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.424
There ain't no job. There ain't no bank,
and I ain't gonna tell you again.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:58.015
I need a break.
I've been down on my luck lately.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.119
Why, I even had to take a job
to keep me eating.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:06.224
Pounding posts, and stringing wire,
and shit like that.

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:08.792
Why can't we let him go with us,
Mr. Spikes?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.293
Because I say.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.441
I still don't see why not.

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.465
Because he's old, damn it.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.818
He's used up all his chances
to be lucky.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:22.785
I'm still a damn good gunfighter.
I'll show you.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.500
Let me fight

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:28.395
this feller. I'll prove it to you.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:29.437
You just watch.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.314
Wait a minute. I don't want to fight.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.817
You'll be dead in a blink.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.569
Come on, boy, draw!

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:36.987
Mister, I'm not gonna shoot with you.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:40.532
You all think I'm an old rooster,
but I can still go.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:43.556
And I'll show you. I can still go.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.208
Well, you killed him.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.729
He was going after Tod.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.206
Yes, he was.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.132
Well, that ought to do it.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.468
He should have known when to quit.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:45.472
An old man on this dodge
ought to get out while he can.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.059
'Cause it don't hold up
over a long stretch.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.395
He was nearly as old as my grandfather.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.690
He had a safety pin
holding up his pants.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.902
Son, what ain't foolishness
in this life is misery.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:01.738
But we gotta hold ourselves
together somehow,

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.840
or we'd always be crying.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.244
You better get some sleep.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.097
We gotta hit that bank in the morning.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.418
- I'd like to make a withdrawal.
- Your name, sir?

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.737
A fine, old, American name.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.681
Colonel Samuel Colt,
and I'll take it all.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:39.106
We'll sign the papers
in the morning, boys.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:41.191
It's a hold-up!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.803
Get out, Tod! Get out!

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.015
Go!

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.322
Tod!

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.242
I got him. Get away.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.032
Come on! Let's get out of here!

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:50.904
Head for those rocks!

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.331
Get behind those rocks!

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:04.748
Run, Mr. Spikes! Run!

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.513
- How is he?
- Damn bad.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.741
I think it nicked his lung.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.979
Hey, you're shot up yourself.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.566
Put some of this on.
It'll keep from getting gangrene.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:30.917
Well, it ain't nothing.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.075
I don't know
when I've liked a boy so much.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.661
He was never noisy, never rude.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.889
A born gentleman by nature.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.984
Well, let's hope the ground that covers
his grave will always be green.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:50.877
He's not dead yet.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.131
He's a goner.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.448
Say goodbye, and let's go.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.362
He's still alive.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:04.079
Put a hat over his face.
He ain't gonna make it.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.186
He's still breathing!

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:09.105
Now, we're gonna take him to a doctor!

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.566
Just loading him on the horse
will be his end.

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:13.794
We ain't leaving Tod behind!

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.697
That posse'll be back.
We're already short a horse.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.532
We won't make it unless we leave him.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.225
Then we won't make it.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.413
I'd stay by his side
if I thought it'd do him any good

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.206
and me no harm.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.434
But that ain't the way it lies.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:34.839
Don't you care nothing about him?
You just said you did.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:37.091
I've left men dead behind me.

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.260
I've left men dying behind me.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.888
And I've left them calling my name.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.890
What you do is shut your ears,
and close your eyes,

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.017
and run like hell.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.227
If you boys were older,
had been at it longer,

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:51.501
you'd know
that's the only way to stay alive.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.927
I sure got a taste
of you now, Mr. Spikes.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:02.450
I am not a follower
of the meek and lowly Jesus.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.535
I never said I was.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.479
I hope to God you boys make it.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:18.533
You mean to shoot me?
Is that why you have your gun out?

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.452
My back is wide. You can't miss.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:08.790
Easy.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.736
I'm gonna get a blanket to cover him up.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.237
- It's awful hot.
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.741
But I think that's
what you're supposed to do.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.743
Why don't he open his eyes?

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.845
He's been bleeding a lot.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.439
Tod?

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.026
Tod?

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.785
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.347
We better switch pants
'cause mine's got blood on 'em.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:49.682
Why don't you let me go?

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:53.561
No, with this neck,
it'll be natural for me to ask.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:55.730
I'll just say I did it on a hay fork.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.607
I hate seeing you take the risk.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.709
Well, it'll be just fine.

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:46.656
I'd like to ask you a question, mister.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.324
First, what are you drinking?

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:49.742
Well, what do you have?

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.245
Whiskey or beer. Beer's warm.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.913
I'll have it anyhow.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.811
That'll be two bits.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.526
Is there a doctor around here?

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.774
What do you need a doctor for?

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:10.429
Well, I've got this cut here,
and I wanted to get it patched up.

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:14.976
That little thing? That ain't nothing.
Put some whiskey on it.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:16.936
No, I'd rather have a doctor.

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:20.381
There's a doctor in Uvalde.
Why don't you go there?

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.401
Well, I'm heading the other way.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:27.238
Well, there's two brothers on a ranch,
what, 10 miles east of here.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:31.343
One of 'em studied to be a dentist.
He fixes up cuts and what not.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:34.954
Well, thank you, mister.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:38.374
How'd you say
you got that little scratch?

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.709
I did it on a hay fork.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.504
Well, don't be in such a rush.
Stay and have another drink.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:44.881
No, I gotta get kicking.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.279
Hell, I'm buying. Now, belly up.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.802
I'd rather not.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:53.827
Man can't stay for a free drink
must be in a hell of a hurry.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:58.311
You must be in a powerful hurry.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:01.022
No hurry, mister. I've just had enough.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:02.920
That ain't friendly.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.505
Is it, Charlie?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:09.422
Suppose we sat on you
and poured it down?

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:14.101
Mister, I treat people good
if they treat me good.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:18.181
If they don't,
I give 'em back what they send.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.691
Les, there ain't a doctor.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.344
They said there's some kind of dentist
about 10 miles east of here.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:15.446
Maybe he can help us.

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:18.582
He's gone.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:23.166
He just stopped breathing.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.314
It's funny, isn't it?

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:44.893
What?

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:50.440
How you and me and Tod
all growed up together.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.738
And now, one of us has finally
gotten himself killed.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.120
We're gonna have to tell his people.

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.040
What do we say to 'em?

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.610
That it is our fault.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.338
That we're the ones that led him to it.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.643
I told him it was gonna be fun.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.190
We're gonna have to bury him.

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:32.106
Are you afraid of ghosts?

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:36.698
Ain't no ghost of his
is gonna bother me.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.614
I loved him.

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:14.281
Come on. Let's get back to Mexico.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.128
Will.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.669
Don't scare him off.

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:38.176
Nice morning, ain't it?

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:46.021
Have you got anything to eat?

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:21.341
He didn't think we'd pay.
We must really look like bandits.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:26.745
These folks around here are
real nice and gentle, you know that?

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.017
Yeah, they are.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:31.375
I could live around them
and do just fine.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:32.727
We wouldn't need much.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:37.156
He don't look like he's got much.
He's smiling.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.717
Well, after I get back
from seeing Tod's folks,

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:41.010
we'll see about it.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.262
After you get back?

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.285
We're both gonna go deliver that letter.

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.832
I had a dream about us last night.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:57.547
We was both up
on these great big, fine-looking horses.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.838
We was barefoot.

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:06.018
And we was riding
through these blue mountains.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:12.434
Everything around us looked
like it was just made that minute.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:18.005
You know, all the grass,
and the trees, and the ferns,

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.483
and the woods and everything.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.222
I looked over to you, and I said,

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.494
"Will,

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.706
"ain't it a grand life?"

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.074
- Hot day.
- Ain't they all?

01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:29.677
Give me a shot of the best you got.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.248
Hello, Harry.

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:36.100
Well, hello, Billy.

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:43.824
I hear you been on the run, Harry.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:47.886
Well, what else did you hear?

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:51.598
Well, I've been serving time
down in Prairie City

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.935
at George Fredrick's. Remember George?

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.562
Well, he's the Marshal down there now.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.773
He told me if I ran into you,
to ask you to go down and see him.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:02.067
He's got a proposition for you.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.235
Proposition?

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.904
Yeah, I think it's a good one.

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:09.658
He said if you don't like it,
you could ride out just like you rode in.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.493
Nothing to lose.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.688
You can trust George.
Why don't you give it a try?

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.524
I don't know, Billy.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.066
Thanks, Harry.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:56.455
Les, I've gone to deliver
the letter to Tod's folks.

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:59.917
I've got a long start on you,
so don't try to follow me.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.920
Meet me in Piedras Negras
two weeks from today

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.964
in that big Catholic church
with the gold altar.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:10.535
Don't forget there's a price
on our heads, so don't get careless.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.114
Hello, Cissie.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:57.992
Hello, Wilson.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.061
Is your ma and dad home?

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.021
Gone into town.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.440
For how long?

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.714
Till dark. You back from running away?

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.575
For a while.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.348
Where you been to?

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:18.596
All around.

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.724
My daddy says you're trash.

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.293
That's up to him.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.521
Didn't you bring Tod back?

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:28.589
No.

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:29.986
Why not?

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.825
You wouldn't recognize Tod, Cissie.
He's doing so well.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:40.434
He's got all new clothes,
and he's grown a head taller than me.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.502
He's as happy as can be.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.674
His dog belongs to me now,
and I ain't givin' him back.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.209
He wouldn't ask you to.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.823
He sent this letter.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.742
You see your ma and daddy get it.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:58.014
I will.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:03.474
You want some lemon cake, Wilson?
We got some.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.566
I can't stay, Cissie.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.753
You don't need that gun.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.231
You Wilson Young?

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:10.924
I want to know
who you are first, mister.

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:15.028
I'm Jack Basset. Les sent me.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:16.780
Why didn't he come himself?

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.991
That's what I'm going to tell you.

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:22.077
You see, him and me,
we got acquainted over to the hotel,

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.997
and we've been kickin'
around together all week.

01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:27.441
He told me you'd be here tonight.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:31.003
What's wrong with him?

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:33.071
I hate to be the one to tell ya.

01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:35.841
Just say if he's alive or not!

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:38.010
He was this morning.

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:40.345
They got him over to the infirmary.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:41.847
No.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:44.099
He's shot up awful bad.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.310
They got him while he was
in his bed in the hotel.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.128
They hit him four times.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:52.295
I don't see how he's hung on this long.

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:06.346
Who did it?

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.123
There was two of 'em.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.251
They ain't even law.
They're damn bounty hunters.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.651
One's named Morton, and one's Spikes.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.257
- Who'd you say?
- Morton.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:18.675
No, the other one.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:19.992
Spikes.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:29.728
What you figuring on doing, son?

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.104
I'm gonna get Les out of there.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.649
But Morton and Spikes is
taking turns watching him.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:37.235
They got a chair parked
right in front of the door to his room.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:38.445
Do they ever come out?

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.073
Once in a while for a breath of air.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.783
That'll be enough.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.242
Which one's on now?

01:27:44.342 --> 01:27:47.312
Morton. Spikes is sleepin'
over to the hotel.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.415
Mister, could I ask you for a favor?

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:52.584
Well, you've done me one already,
but could I ask you for another?

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:53.919
Sure, son.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:56.797
Could you go over to the hotel
and keep an eye on Spikes for me?

01:27:56.897 --> 01:28:00.242
I will. Don't you fight him fair.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:13.751
You.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.675
Step out where I can get a look at you.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.719
Who are you? Don't I know you?

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:31.289
No. No, sir, you don't.

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:33.458
What do you want around here?

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.961
Well, I don't want nothing.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.754
Then move on.

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:39.798
My sheep dog's run off from me.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.551
He's got a brown muzzle.
You ain't seen him, have you?

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:44.278
I told you to move on.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.347
Well, then maybe you seen my friend.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.308
He lives in Llano County.
I've known him all my life.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:51.955
And he's well-liked by everybody.

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:53.749
You're Wilson Young.

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:18.903
Les.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.673
Les, listen.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.342
That northbound train pulls
out of here in half an hour.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.285
We're gonna be on it.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:36.563
Maybe we'll go to Montana.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.633
To them blue mountains
you was talking about.

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:44.087
We'll find a place of our own to live.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:48.658
Maybe we can run some cattle

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:50.635
and a few good horses.

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.371
I can build a cabin

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:56.395
and just sit up there
on our own front porch.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:59.838
Hello, boy.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:03.191
I just killed Mr. Morton
down the street.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.734
No loss.

01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:06.611
You're next.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.088
Well, that ain't decided yet.

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:10.849
I didn't come here to talk.

01:31:12.342 --> 01:31:15.328
Funny how things work out.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:19.457
The governor of the state of Texas
gave me a chance to come in, full amnesty,

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.685
for all my acts and crimes.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:26.280
As long as I delivered you two.

01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:30.865
I handed him my pistol,
butt-first, and I said,

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:35.307
"I am giving you that
which I have never allowed

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:39.332
"another living man to touch,
except myself."

01:31:43.873 --> 01:31:45.734
And he pumped my hand.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:48.153
And they took my picture.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.676
And two ladies present wept.

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.327
Your gun's in the holster.

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:58.226
You'd better sit up,
or you can't reach it.

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:03.522
I wanted to bring Les in alive.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:07.822
I would have liked it better that way.

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:10.608
But he pulled on me.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.387
Is that the last thing
you want to say to me?

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:15.909
'Cause it ain't much.

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:20.226
Anything I ever got
in this life was by felony.

01:32:20.326 --> 01:32:22.854
I've been a hungry dog,
snapping at meat.

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:26.128
And then you boys came along.
You looked up to me.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:30.387
What did you want from me, anyhow?

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:34.616
I don't know anymore.
It was a foolish hope.

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:36.514
Better luck next time.

01:32:37.635 --> 01:32:39.353
Sit up, Mr. Spikes.

01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:45.317
You're a fine boy.

01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:49.130
If we'd met in a different life,

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.091
we might've took a walk
down a shady street

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:54.052
and looked at the ladies
through the window panes.

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:58.703
Or I might've carved a Sunday roast
and given you the biggest portion.

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:04.270
But don't let me mix you up.

01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:05.496
Sit up!

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:18.218
Right there.

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:20.704
Is this all?

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:23.557
It ain't really fair,
but it's all I'm givin' you.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:51.437
And by God, the one thing we won't ever do
is kiss no man's boot!

01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:52.834
You bet!

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:55.841
Let's go get lucky!
