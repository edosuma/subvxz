00:19.500 --> 00:23.277
Man: <i>Across the ages,
it has been called many things,</i>

00:23.338 --> 00:26.478
<i>the borderlands,
the wild fields,</i>

00:26.541 --> 00:28.145
<i>the bread basket of Europe.</i>

00:30.311 --> 00:34.350
<i>But since I was a boy,
Ukraine was simply home.</i>

00:35.850 --> 00:39.161
<i>Even as we dreamed of freedom
from the Russian's tsar,</i>

00:39.220 --> 00:41.894
<i>life went on as it always had,</i>

00:41.956 --> 00:44.664
<i>moving to the rhythm of the seasons,</i>

00:44.726 --> 00:49.004
<i>waxing and waning in the eternal cycle
of seed, plough and reaping.</i>

00:52.300 --> 00:55.372
<i>A life of hard work
and small pleasures.</i>

01:17.859 --> 01:20.999
<i>My name is Yuri Kachaniuk...</i>

01:21.062 --> 01:24.066
<i>the son of Yaroslav Kachaniuk,</i>

01:24.132 --> 01:28.376
<i>and the grandson
of the famous warrior Ivan Kachaniuk.</i>

01:33.274 --> 01:36.949
<i>My Ukraine was a world
where legends lived...</i>

01:38.579 --> 01:40.752
<i>and anything was possible.</i>

01:57.965 --> 01:59.569
Girl: <i>Yuri.</i>

02:23.624 --> 02:26.935
Yuri: <i>Before I grew up
and learned that dragons were real</i>

02:26.994 --> 02:29.998
<i>and evil roamed the world,</i>

02:30.064 --> 02:31.907
<i>I fell in love.</i>

02:36.204 --> 02:39.651
<i>From the moment I saw her,
I could think of nothing else.</i>

02:41.309 --> 02:43.721
<i>I dreamed of growing up to marry her</i>

02:43.778 --> 02:45.815
<i>and of loving her forever.</i>

02:48.683 --> 02:52.324
<i>As the Bolshevik Revolution
raged its way towards us,</i>

02:52.386 --> 02:55.390
<i>I could think only of Natalka.</i>

02:57.125 --> 02:58.900
This is the one
that's bewitched you?

03:06.567 --> 03:08.171
You see this bell?

03:08.236 --> 03:11.217
It used to warn the village
when the Tartar hordes invaded,

03:11.272 --> 03:15.152
tried to conquer us,
take away our freedom.

03:15.209 --> 03:17.348
Like the tsar did?

03:17.411 --> 03:19.288
Yes.

03:19.347 --> 03:21.020
They can never break your spirit.

03:21.082 --> 03:25.462
No one... no one can ever
take away your freedom.

03:26.220 --> 03:27.722
You remember that.

03:43.237 --> 03:46.514
Yuri.
Here, son, you try.

03:48.242 --> 03:49.744
Hold it like this.

03:50.711 --> 03:54.352
They killed the tsar.

03:56.050 --> 03:58.553
- The Bolsheviks?
- In Ekaterinburg.

03:58.619 --> 04:00.098
Now Ukraine can be free.

04:00.988 --> 04:02.934
The revolutionaries
have killed the tsar.

04:02.990 --> 04:05.095
Give him back the Sabre.

04:05.159 --> 04:07.639
He needs to learn
how to fight for our country,

04:07.695 --> 04:09.299
grow up a free man.

04:10.898 --> 04:12.571
He's different.

04:30.651 --> 04:33.029
Yuri: <i>The death of the tsar
brought a few glorious years</i>

04:33.087 --> 04:35.727
<i>of independence to Ukraine,</i>

04:35.790 --> 04:38.737
<i>but it was soon crushed
by the Soviets.</i>

04:38.793 --> 04:41.364
<i>The people were forced to agree
to a style of communism</i>

04:41.429 --> 04:44.638
<i>that was demanded
by the Soviet leader, Lenin.</i>

04:56.844 --> 04:58.323
Again?

04:58.379 --> 04:59.915
It's a new age, Yuri.

04:59.981 --> 05:03.019
It's our duty to the State
to inform and influence,

05:03.084 --> 05:04.654
not indulge in selfish desires.

05:04.719 --> 05:06.926
He's right.
Artists are flocking to Kiev.

05:06.988 --> 05:08.934
- Come with us.
- I can't leave.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.492
Oh, yes, 'cause you're in love.

05:10.558 --> 05:13.164
Ask her to marry you
and she can come with us, too.

05:13.227 --> 05:15.298
- Ask her.
- Yeah, I have many times.

05:15.363 --> 05:16.706
- And?
- And she says that

05:16.764 --> 05:18.072
I don't know what
I'm getting myself into.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.174
Then you need to woo her.

05:21.235 --> 05:22.714
Write her a poem.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.306
- I'm no poet.
- Sing her a love song.

05:24.372 --> 05:25.407
Me, sing?

05:27.541 --> 05:29.282
Well, then,
ask her to sit for you

05:29.343 --> 05:31.789
and do a real portrait,

05:31.846 --> 05:34.554
instead of these fanciful doodles.

05:53.434 --> 05:55.141
Let me paint you.

05:55.202 --> 05:56.545
Why?

05:56.604 --> 05:58.584
'Cause you're beautiful.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.448
And where would you like to paint me?

06:00.508 --> 06:02.545
In the forest,
where we used to play as children.

06:02.610 --> 06:03.611
Oh, I see.

06:03.678 --> 06:06.215
I will paint you as a "Rusalka,"

06:06.280 --> 06:08.817
frolicking by the water... naked.

06:11.519 --> 06:14.728
Natalka, please let me paint you.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.793
Mykola:
Oh, we said woo her!

06:18.859 --> 06:20.566
Woo her. Is that it?

06:31.539 --> 06:33.143
Mykola: Come on!

06:40.448 --> 06:42.394
Natalka, come with us.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.259
Come to Kiev.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.596
Leave the village?

06:52.293 --> 06:53.294
Yes.

06:54.395 --> 06:57.842
I have an uncle, Josef, and he can
get Yuri a job at the factory.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.937
You must come.

07:01.002 --> 07:02.709
It's the future, Natalka.

07:10.544 --> 07:12.023
Yuri: So what made you
change your mind?

07:12.813 --> 07:14.554
Natalka:
Oh, you seemed so desperate.

07:14.615 --> 07:16.458
Oh, okay.

07:19.687 --> 07:22.668
Well, you're here.
That's all that matters.

07:24.392 --> 07:26.372
Don't make more
of this than what it is.

07:28.329 --> 07:29.364
Of course not.

07:30.231 --> 07:32.438
I just need you to understand,
if it wasn't for my...

07:32.500 --> 07:33.706
I don't care.

07:35.669 --> 07:38.377
What difference does it make to me
whether your parents are married or not?

07:40.708 --> 07:42.949
You think you don't, but you will.

07:43.010 --> 07:46.958
You don't understand what it's like
to not be accepted by others,

07:47.014 --> 07:48.391
judged by your neighbors.

07:48.449 --> 07:51.123
Why seek that trouble
if you have a choice?

07:51.786 --> 07:53.356
Choice?

07:53.421 --> 07:55.128
- You think I have a choice?
- Don't. Don't start.

07:55.189 --> 07:57.169
No, no, no, I haven't had
a choice about how I felt

07:57.224 --> 07:59.329
since the first moment I saw you.

08:01.595 --> 08:03.541
You don't understand the real world.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.842
Yes, I do.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.575
We can face it together.

08:27.555 --> 08:30.399
Tonight, at the festival,
when you ask the gods,

08:30.458 --> 08:31.801
you'll see.

08:35.261 --> 08:36.535
We belong together.

08:54.181 --> 08:55.717
Will I ever marry?

09:57.978 --> 09:59.582
You shouldn't love me.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.529
I'll only bring you misfortune.

10:04.585 --> 10:07.395
Oh, I have been a fool
for lesser things.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.731
Don't run away from me, Natalka.

10:13.527 --> 10:14.972
Marry me.

10:59.740 --> 11:01.185
Man:
But, Comrade Stalin,

11:01.242 --> 11:03.449
Comrade Lenin tried to collectivize.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.547
He targeted the intelligentsia,

11:05.613 --> 11:06.614
the church, the peasants.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.718
The Ukrainians rebelled.
They flourished.

11:09.783 --> 11:11.558
Lenin was too lenient.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.826
Syphilis had softened his brain.

11:13.887 --> 11:17.733
Ukraine must be taught
to bow to our will.

11:17.791 --> 11:21.534
Without its huge mineral wealth
and vast harvests of grain,

11:21.595 --> 11:24.098
Russia cannot exist.

11:24.164 --> 11:26.474
So, Koba, how do you
propose we proceed?

11:27.268 --> 11:29.646
Stalin: We implement Lenin's plan,

11:29.703 --> 11:31.182
but without mercy.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.102
Father Ostapovich:
Bless you.

12:04.271 --> 12:06.046
Father Ostapovich:
Bless you, my son.

12:08.008 --> 12:09.817
Ivan:
Yah! Yah, yah!

12:19.653 --> 12:21.929
Finish your prayer, Priest.
We need to talk.

12:24.825 --> 12:26.532
Tell me...

12:26.593 --> 12:28.834
where is the church's
gold and silver?

12:31.265 --> 12:34.872
You think these peasants need all these
material objects to worship their god?

12:38.038 --> 12:40.348
And what object of value hung there?

12:44.611 --> 12:46.181
Where's the icon?

12:50.651 --> 12:52.995
- Dmitri!
- Yes, sir!

12:56.023 --> 12:57.696
I will return.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.962
In the meantime,

13:02.029 --> 13:04.236
I suggest you pray to your god.

13:05.799 --> 13:07.335
Not that it'll do you any good.

13:24.551 --> 13:26.121
Yaroslav:
They're coming.

13:26.186 --> 13:27.665
- The Bolsheviks?
- Yes.

13:28.522 --> 13:30.195
- Sound the alarm.
- Let me come with you.

13:30.257 --> 13:31.861
Do as your grandfather says.

13:31.925 --> 13:33.063
Go, Yuri, go!

13:33.127 --> 13:34.299
Ivan: Yah, yah!

13:34.361 --> 13:36.568
Yuri, raise the alarm. Go!

13:50.210 --> 13:51.450
Child:
They're soldiers!

14:03.590 --> 14:05.592
I am Commissar Sergei Koltsov.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.239
You are Boyko?

14:11.665 --> 14:13.303
I see, Boyko,

14:13.367 --> 14:14.744
you own a Horse,

14:14.802 --> 14:16.475
Cow...

14:18.906 --> 14:20.180
Land.

14:22.543 --> 14:24.454
You hire help to manage the land?

14:28.849 --> 14:30.260
Then you are <i>Kulak</i>,

14:30.317 --> 14:32.422
a privileged class,
an enemy of the State.

14:32.486 --> 14:33.897
Bastards!

14:33.954 --> 14:35.831
Blood-sucking bastards!

14:37.291 --> 14:38.531
I am a poor peasant.

14:38.592 --> 14:40.401
That's for the State to decide.

14:40.461 --> 14:43.567
If you cooperate, you'll be allowed
to live in the cooperative.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.303
You mean own my own land?

14:45.365 --> 14:47.436
If you don't...

14:47.501 --> 14:49.674
you'll either be jailed...

14:49.736 --> 14:51.181
or shot.

14:53.073 --> 14:54.552
When will the State decide?

14:54.608 --> 14:56.281
It already has.

14:58.612 --> 15:00.751
You leave at sundown.

15:00.814 --> 15:04.785
If not, you'll be arrested
for trespassing on State land.

15:05.619 --> 15:07.257
Yaroslav:
What do you want with this man?

15:07.321 --> 15:08.664
He's an enemy of the state.

15:08.722 --> 15:10.395
Enemy? That's nonsense.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.204
Brother, you and your family
are welcome to stay with us.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.673
- And who are you?
- Free men.

15:34.815 --> 15:35.919
Yah!

15:39.019 --> 15:40.157
Whoa, whoa!

18:03.230 --> 18:06.040
Oh, God.

19:35.222 --> 19:36.633
No one...

19:36.690 --> 19:39.569
no one can ever
take away your freedom.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.162
You remember that.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.109
Father Ostapovich:
God be with you, my son.

20:25.172 --> 20:28.346
Have you seen the old man?
I hear he's still alive.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.517
You wouldn't lie to me, Priest.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.081
It's a sin.

20:34.147 --> 20:35.683
We're all sinners.

20:35.749 --> 20:38.992
- Then you've been praying, comrade?
- Every day.

20:39.052 --> 20:40.554
And has your God
produced the icon?

20:40.620 --> 20:42.531
No, he has not.

20:42.589 --> 20:43.966
Do you know why?

20:44.691 --> 20:46.693
Because there is no God,

20:46.760 --> 20:48.706
no evil, no sin, no hell.

20:52.132 --> 20:53.372
It's all a delusion.

20:55.368 --> 20:57.541
Hell is the inability to love.

21:09.583 --> 21:10.823
Dmitri:
This is the last of it.

21:13.153 --> 21:15.690
Comrade, we'll start building
the cells in the morning.

21:46.353 --> 21:49.800
Yuri: Natalka, I love you!

21:49.856 --> 21:52.166
Yuri: Let us in.
We wanna see you!

21:52.225 --> 21:54.705
Mykola: Come on!
We need to see what you look like there.

21:56.129 --> 21:57.199
Ghana:
Taras!

21:58.164 --> 21:59.734
Natalka!

21:59.799 --> 22:01.107
- Ooh, Natalka!
- No!

22:03.837 --> 22:04.838
- Taras, no!
- No, no...

22:04.905 --> 22:06.384
No, I love you.
Come with me.

22:06.439 --> 22:08.043
- Please.
- Taras, you're drunk.

22:08.108 --> 22:09.951
I love you.
Marry me, please.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.011
Stop-

22:11.077 --> 22:12.488
Olena:
Taras, she's marrying Yuri.

23:01.061 --> 23:02.597
Where are you going?

23:02.662 --> 23:05.233
I'm going to see our friends
before they leave for Kiev.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.442
Ivan:
Your friends are cowards...

23:09.736 --> 23:13.548
who think they can fight battles
using music and words.

23:16.977 --> 23:19.082
Yuri tried to help.

23:19.145 --> 23:20.556
He was trying
to be more like you.

23:20.613 --> 23:21.887
He's not like me.

23:23.249 --> 23:24.922
And he's nothing like his father.

23:36.162 --> 23:38.665
Mykola:
Please, come, Yuri.

23:38.732 --> 23:39.802
My uncle can get you work.

23:39.866 --> 23:43.313
And, look.
The State is inviting artists.

23:45.005 --> 23:47.349
I can't leave.

23:47.407 --> 23:49.148
Not now.

23:49.209 --> 23:51.519
Not until Natalka's mother recovers.

23:51.578 --> 23:54.286
We'll come,
as soon as she's better.

24:01.921 --> 24:03.923
I'll join you as soon as I can.

24:09.162 --> 24:10.664
Good-bye, Taras.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.738
Look after yourself.

24:21.574 --> 24:24.180
Stalin: Unless we end
our economic backwardness,

24:24.244 --> 24:28.192
our enemies in the west
will destroy us.

24:28.248 --> 24:32.628
Every man, woman, and child
must do their duty to feed the workers.

24:32.685 --> 24:35.495
Have the State requisition
more of the harvest,

24:35.555 --> 24:38.229
up to 90% if necessary.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.998
But, Comrade Stalin,

24:40.060 --> 24:42.336
that will be a death sentence
for the farmers.

24:42.395 --> 24:44.341
The revolution depends on it.

24:44.898 --> 24:46.138
Think of the greater good.

24:48.334 --> 24:50.336
He's probably right, Koba.

24:50.403 --> 24:53.179
This could mean the death of millions.

24:55.675 --> 24:56.881
Who in the world will know?

24:58.378 --> 25:00.824
Sergei: Those caught stealing grain
have received justice,

25:00.880 --> 25:04.828
but the collective
of this village has failed.

25:04.884 --> 25:07.023
You did not meet your grain quota.

25:07.087 --> 25:09.897
Consequently, Comrade Stalin
has ordered an increase.

25:09.956 --> 25:12.232
All over Ukraine it's the same.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.294
You must double production this year

25:14.360 --> 25:16.362
or you will suffer the consequences.

25:16.429 --> 25:18.670
Much of the harvest
was lost to weather.

25:18.731 --> 25:20.176
Or stolen.

25:20.233 --> 25:22.179
That's a lie.

25:22.235 --> 25:24.078
We don't have enough horses
to plow the fields.

25:24.137 --> 25:25.241
Why is that, comrade?

25:25.305 --> 25:26.375
We had to eat them.

25:26.439 --> 25:29.010
Dmitri: That is why Comrade Stalin
brought you tractors,

25:29.075 --> 25:32.215
modern mechanical means
to meet your responsibilities.

25:32.278 --> 25:34.986
And you repay him
by stealing from the State?

25:35.048 --> 25:37.756
That's what I call ingratitude.

25:38.718 --> 25:40.595
Dmitri:
We know you're hiding grain.

25:43.623 --> 25:46.729
Sign. Join the collective.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.396
Life will be much better.

25:56.569 --> 26:00.142
Man: Our seizure of church property
has not been as lucrative as we hoped.

26:00.206 --> 26:04.518
Despite the crackdown,
collectivization is still slow.

26:04.577 --> 26:08.218
I've already started shipping
the kulak leaders to Siberia,

26:08.281 --> 26:11.785
but resistance is strong
and spreading.

26:11.851 --> 26:14.457
If we do not stop it,
we could lose Ukraine.

26:14.521 --> 26:17.593
They think they have choices
when they have only one.

26:18.525 --> 26:20.163
Stalin:
Push them.

26:20.226 --> 26:21.637
Crush them.

26:53.226 --> 26:56.503
- You want me to sign this?
- The land belongs to the State.

27:01.601 --> 27:04.810
You, your icon, your land...

27:06.206 --> 27:08.049
all belong to the State now.

27:33.366 --> 27:35.778
Here. Take the knife.

27:37.604 --> 27:38.742
It was Father's.

27:40.773 --> 27:43.379
It's time for you to leave.

27:58.958 --> 28:00.198
Before you leave,

28:00.260 --> 28:03.730
I want you to hold the ancient
and holy spirit of our village.

28:07.867 --> 28:10.347
The icon of Saint Yuri.

28:10.403 --> 28:12.576
The symbol of our faith.

28:15.074 --> 28:17.179
And here...

28:17.243 --> 28:19.245
your father's dream.

28:21.914 --> 28:23.655
Had I gone...

28:25.451 --> 28:26.725
he would still be alive.

28:28.521 --> 28:29.625
Go to Kiev.

28:30.423 --> 28:34.132
Go and become the artist
you've always dreamed of being.

28:36.329 --> 28:38.434
It's what your father
would have wanted.

29:00.887 --> 29:02.093
Hold me.

29:03.523 --> 29:05.093
As long as you can.

29:07.427 --> 29:09.737
Come on.
We can do this on the train all you like.

29:13.333 --> 29:14.903
I'm not coming.

29:17.537 --> 29:18.675
What?

29:19.172 --> 29:20.173
Not yet.

29:21.974 --> 29:24.147
No, I can't go without you.

29:25.511 --> 29:27.013
- I won't.
- You have to.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.784
In Kiev, there's work for you

29:28.848 --> 29:31.055
and you can send back money
so we can eat.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.619
To be away from you, I...

29:33.386 --> 29:34.888
No, I... I'll die, I...

29:34.954 --> 29:36.831
It's just until Mother's better.
And then I can...

29:36.889 --> 29:38.266
I can be with you.

29:39.992 --> 29:41.300
I...

29:41.361 --> 29:42.999
Yuri...

29:45.965 --> 29:47.501
Kiev is where you belong.

29:51.571 --> 29:52.948
I...

29:56.008 --> 29:57.851
I love you.

30:05.385 --> 30:07.160
Wear it close to your heart.

31:09.782 --> 31:11.386
I don't think I'm that handsome.

31:13.085 --> 31:15.565
- You have the gift.
- Thank you.

31:15.621 --> 31:17.396
Where are you off to?

31:17.457 --> 31:19.095
Uh, Kiev.

31:20.092 --> 31:22.902
- To work in a factory.
- With your talent?

31:24.564 --> 31:27.170
- I have a duty to my family.
- We all have duties.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.476
But you are an artist.

31:31.270 --> 31:33.250
And you have a duty

31:33.306 --> 31:36.014
to let the world know the truth,

31:36.075 --> 31:38.521
any Way you can.

31:47.820 --> 31:50.096
Please, please.

31:50.156 --> 31:52.534
Help me.

31:52.592 --> 31:54.299
Have mercy on me, please.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.634
- Conductor: Scum.
- Woman: Please, sir.

31:55.695 --> 31:56.969
- Woman: Wait.
- She's begging for food.

31:57.029 --> 31:58.269
There is food.

31:59.298 --> 32:00.606
Plenty of food.

32:02.702 --> 32:04.477
That's the official party line.

32:04.537 --> 32:06.539
No famine.

32:06.606 --> 32:08.643
Just a food shortage.

32:08.708 --> 32:10.915
No starvation, instead,

32:10.977 --> 32:12.752
widespread malnutrition.

32:15.147 --> 32:16.888
Well, this is where
I have to leave you.

32:29.262 --> 32:30.297
- Journalist: What are you doing?
- Soldier: Be quiet.

32:30.363 --> 32:31.899
Journalist:
Let go of me. Stop this.

32:31.964 --> 32:33.671
Soldier: Come with us.

32:33.733 --> 32:36.111
Journalist: You can't do this.
I demand to talk to my embassy.

32:36.168 --> 32:37.841
- Soldier: You're under arrest.
- Journalist: On what charges?

32:37.904 --> 32:39.212
Soldier: For spreading
Western propaganda.

32:39.272 --> 32:41.513
Journalist: You can't do this.
The whole world will hear of this.

32:41.574 --> 32:42.609
Soldier:
Come with us.

32:42.675 --> 32:44.279
Journalist: I'm a member of the...

32:45.511 --> 32:46.888
Get down.

32:50.917 --> 32:53.363
Get him up. Let's go.

34:19.304 --> 34:21.545
Mykola:
Change is not the enemy.

34:21.607 --> 34:25.179
Reassure the peasants
that collectivization is not a theft

34:25.244 --> 34:28.054
but a common action
to help us prosper.

34:28.114 --> 34:31.618
Let's educate people
about what we're trying to do.

34:31.684 --> 34:34.995
All right,
we'll reconvene in the morning.

34:35.054 --> 34:36.897
Yuri: My God.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.994
Finally he's here.

34:40.793 --> 34:42.739
Did I hear the call
of a Kachaniuk?

34:44.764 --> 34:46.368
Comrade, these are for copying, yes?

34:46.431 --> 34:48.172
- Excellent work.
- Thank you.

34:48.868 --> 34:51.542
What happened?
You... you're so grown up.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.914
The world grew up.
We're just taking part.

34:53.973 --> 34:55.918
Time for a catch-up, young man.

34:55.975 --> 34:57.613
A drink. God, yes.

34:57.677 --> 35:00.214
Don't let the party
hear you say "God."

35:00.846 --> 35:03.258
Yuri, tell me,
how's the beautiful Natalka?

35:03.315 --> 35:04.817
But don't let Mykola hear.

35:05.885 --> 35:07.228
Are you still in love with her,

35:07.286 --> 35:09.766
even after you were
so gracious in defeat?

35:09.822 --> 35:11.233
I was.

35:11.290 --> 35:13.861
Let it be my sad epitaph,

35:13.926 --> 35:16.304
"I was gracious in defeat."

35:16.362 --> 35:19.434
Mykola: We're making progress.

35:19.498 --> 35:21.739
There's so much hope in the city.

35:21.801 --> 35:24.213
We're on the cusp
of national renaissance.

35:24.270 --> 35:26.682
- Things are really changing.
- Yes, but how?

35:26.739 --> 35:28.810
And to what end?

35:28.874 --> 35:30.876
I mean, the things
I've seen in just one day...

35:31.911 --> 35:34.152
Something is terribly wrong, Mykola.

35:34.213 --> 35:38.355
Every new system
has its growing pains, of course.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.522
The winter was bad for the harvest.

35:40.586 --> 35:41.690
Yuri:
No, it's worse than that.

35:41.754 --> 35:43.791
There are Soviets in our village

35:43.856 --> 35:46.427
forcing the collectivization of our farms.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.096
Violently.

35:48.861 --> 35:51.671
And just arriving,
I have seen people starving,

35:51.731 --> 35:54.507
left to rot like garbage.

35:54.567 --> 35:57.480
I mean, you've walked the streets.
You must have seen it.

35:57.536 --> 35:59.413
There are severe hardships,

35:59.472 --> 36:01.349
just as there were under the tsar.

36:02.475 --> 36:04.352
We have our own freedom now,

36:04.410 --> 36:07.482
an opportunity to push on,

36:07.546 --> 36:11.824
to reorganize society so that
everyone gets their fair share.

36:13.519 --> 36:16.022
This is Stalin's true vision.

36:30.402 --> 36:32.348
Stalin:
Kaganovich.

36:33.472 --> 36:34.974
Haven't I had you shot?

36:37.710 --> 36:40.088
Do you not drink with your comrades?

36:40.146 --> 36:42.023
I bring news from Ukraine.

36:43.549 --> 36:47.725
I told you to crush them.
Why do you fail me over and over?

36:47.787 --> 36:49.767
They rise up because they are starving.

36:49.822 --> 36:52.029
The more ruthless our methods,
the more they resist.

36:52.091 --> 36:53.832
Damn those Ukrainians!

36:58.464 --> 37:02.276
Take all their food.
Not just the grain. Everything.

37:03.102 --> 37:05.309
Close the food stores and banks.

37:06.038 --> 37:08.746
Transport the food out.
Close the borders.

37:08.808 --> 37:13.018
Keep them in.
Do not let one of them leave.

37:34.967 --> 37:35.968
Leave it!

38:07.499 --> 38:09.274
<i>"Darling, Yuri,</i>

38:09.335 --> 38:13.408
<i>thank you for your letters which
come to me like a beacon in the dark.</i>

38:15.641 --> 38:18.178
<i>Things are worse here.
The quotas keep rising</i>

38:18.244 --> 38:20.019
<i>and we get to keep
less of the harvest</i>

38:20.079 --> 38:22.252
<i>and more and more people go hungry.</i>

38:25.551 --> 38:27.690
<i>Mama was released
from her suffering...</i>

38:28.721 --> 38:30.394
<i>and I miss her so.</i>

38:31.490 --> 38:34.369
<i>She must have whispered
a blessing on her journey, Yuri,</i>

38:34.426 --> 38:36.804
<i>because I have wonderful news.</i>

38:38.230 --> 38:40.005
<i>I'm carrying our child.</i>

38:41.867 --> 38:44.609
<i>This great joy gives me such hope</i>

38:44.670 --> 38:48.413
<i>that I can soon join you in Kiev
and truly hear your voice</i>

38:48.474 --> 38:50.579
<i>and feel your touch.</i>

38:51.310 --> 38:54.291
<i>I look at the moon and dream of you.</i>

38:54.346 --> 38:58.192
<i>Please do the same
and know that I'll always be yours.</i>

38:58.250 --> 39:00.423
<i>Love... Natalka."</i>

39:02.321 --> 39:04.858
Yuri:
<i>"What wonderful news.</i>

39:04.924 --> 39:07.768
<i>A child. Our child.</i>

39:07.826 --> 39:10.602
<i>You must now come to Kiev
so I can take care of you.</i>

39:12.831 --> 39:14.572
<i>I've been accepted into the academy,</i>

39:14.633 --> 39:17.477
<i>so despite these terrible times,</i>

39:17.536 --> 39:19.914
<i>I have great hopes for our future."</i>

39:23.676 --> 39:24.916
Perfect.

39:26.245 --> 39:28.191
- Thank you.
- Too perfect.

39:29.782 --> 39:31.227
Too fanciful!

39:36.055 --> 39:37.398
Come back.

39:39.158 --> 39:41.069
As an artist,
you must find the truth,

39:41.126 --> 39:42.332
not escape from it.

39:42.394 --> 39:43.737
Yes, but how?

39:48.767 --> 39:50.371
With light.

39:50.436 --> 39:52.109
With light, you find the truth.

39:54.206 --> 39:56.880
Have you read Andre Breton's,
"Manifeste Du Surrealism"?

39:59.078 --> 40:00.489
Seen the works of Salvador Dali?

40:01.714 --> 40:02.852
Pablo Picasso?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.320
Do you dream?

40:06.385 --> 40:07.659
Yes, of course.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.859
Well, then, express yourself
through your subconscious,

40:09.922 --> 40:11.663
through dreams.

40:12.992 --> 40:16.201
Reality... is the enemy.

40:28.340 --> 40:29.785
Why, Dido?

40:35.014 --> 40:38.120
I don't want you to be
forced into whoring for food.

40:40.452 --> 40:42.363
What difference does it make?

40:43.889 --> 40:45.698
We're all going to die.

40:52.297 --> 40:55.141
Yuri: <i>"My darling,
I am desperate for news of you.</i>

40:55.200 --> 40:57.510
<i>No letters for weeks
makes me fear the worst."</i>

41:12.384 --> 41:14.830
Mykola:
If we are going to be judged

41:14.887 --> 41:18.528
then let us be judged
by members of the civilized world

41:18.590 --> 41:21.264
and not by Red Soviet imperialism,

41:21.326 --> 41:24.933
to that higher court that Stalin
never would want to be a part of.

41:24.997 --> 41:27.273
- Man: Yes!
- Man 2: Hear, hear!

41:27.332 --> 41:31.508
Mykola: Ukraine has so much to share
culturally with other countries of Europe,

41:31.570 --> 41:35.541
The Europe of Darwin,
of Goethe, of Byron, Newton,

41:35.607 --> 41:37.280
and, of course, Marx.

41:46.452 --> 41:49.456
Ukrainians can be proud once again.

41:49.521 --> 41:53.799
Inspired by the words
of the great Taras Shevchenko,

41:53.859 --> 41:56.396
by the roar of the Dnieper River,

41:56.462 --> 41:58.942
the whisper of the endless steppe.

41:58.997 --> 42:01.568
Inspired to develop our culture

42:01.633 --> 42:04.580
and take our rightful place

42:04.636 --> 42:07.207
among the great nations of the world.

42:13.312 --> 42:16.156
Yuri:
<i>"Taras and I are so proud of Mykola.</i>

42:16.215 --> 42:19.560
<i>He has become leader
of the Ukrainian Communist Party</i>

42:19.618 --> 42:23.498
<i>and a great inspiration
to the spirit of the national movement.</i>

42:24.656 --> 42:29.662
<i>But we all sense a change,
a darker, more oppressive atmosphere.</i>

42:29.728 --> 42:33.198
<i>A loss of freedoms,
meetings, free discussion,</i>

42:33.265 --> 42:35.973
<i>even travel,
all are becoming restricted."</i>

42:36.034 --> 42:38.981
Passport.

42:47.412 --> 42:48.720
It's hideous.

42:49.581 --> 42:50.582
Reactionary.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.923
You must paint uplifting images
of the Soviet Union.

42:53.986 --> 42:56.057
What, like factories and tractors?

42:56.121 --> 42:57.759
You are no artist.

42:57.823 --> 43:00.463
- You are an enemy of the State.
- Where's Professor Temchuk?

43:01.493 --> 43:03.063
I demand to speak to him.

43:03.128 --> 43:05.039
Then you will have to go to Siberia.

43:14.106 --> 43:17.451
Yuri: <i>"All self-expression
and individualism is being suppressed</i>

43:17.509 --> 43:20.752
<i>in favor of a conformist Soviet style.</i>

43:22.481 --> 43:24.461
<i>This is not art.</i>

43:26.318 --> 43:28.628
<i>I have been forced
to leave the academy...</i>

43:28.687 --> 43:31.634
<i>and found work as a rag and bone man,</i>

43:31.690 --> 43:35.001
<i>where we traffic in
the keepsakes of ghosts,</i>

43:35.060 --> 43:38.337
<i>the ones we have lost
in this terrible famine."</i>

43:46.905 --> 43:48.714
Yuri:
<i>"The people from the countryside,</i>

43:48.774 --> 43:52.688
<i>who have flocked to the city
in search of food, starve.</i>

43:52.744 --> 43:56.123
<i>The others, the factory workers,</i>

43:56.181 --> 43:57.319
<i>have plenty to eat."</i>

43:58.250 --> 43:59.991
Child:
Mama, please.

44:01.954 --> 44:03.490
Child:
Mama, wake up.

44:06.558 --> 44:09.437
Please help us. Please.

44:11.430 --> 44:13.103
Mama.

44:13.165 --> 44:14.906
Wake up.

44:14.967 --> 44:16.640
Mama.

44:18.737 --> 44:20.580
Yuri:
<i>"Trust me, Natalka...</i>

44:22.674 --> 44:24.711
<i>I will not fail.</i>

44:26.144 --> 44:28.317
<i>I will make it home to you soon."</i>

44:29.314 --> 44:31.624
Woman: We are just waiting for Mykola

44:31.683 --> 44:34.323
for his reaction. Please!

44:42.160 --> 44:45.437
Man on phone: <i>They've started arresting
all the Ukrainian party leaders.</i>

44:46.431 --> 44:48.502
<i>They will be with you soon.</i>

44:48.567 --> 44:50.547
<i>Get away if you can.</i>

45:11.556 --> 45:13.866
Mykola:
<i>"My dear brother Yuri,</i>

45:13.925 --> 45:16.371
<i>don't grieve.</i>

45:16.428 --> 45:18.840
<i>You were right.</i>

45:18.897 --> 45:20.501
<i>Stalin has betrayed us all."</i>

45:20.565 --> 45:23.774
Woman:
Be patient. Be calm. Please.

45:23.835 --> 45:24.836
Be calm.

45:27.339 --> 45:30.320
Mykola: <i>"I was a fool to believe
I could be a Ukrainian patriot</i>

45:30.375 --> 45:31.820
<i>and a communist."</i>

45:40.152 --> 45:44.157
Mykola: <i>"And I was a fool to have been
in love with my best friend's wife.</i>

45:46.491 --> 45:48.698
<i>Save yourself,</i>

45:48.760 --> 45:50.467
<i>like I could not."</i>

45:55.967 --> 45:58.413
To a fire that burned brightly

45:58.470 --> 46:00.381
but was extinguished too soon.

46:02.774 --> 46:05.050
- Mykola, our friend.
- Officer: Ha!

46:05.110 --> 46:07.613
All:
Mykola!

46:14.019 --> 46:16.021
To all Ukrainian nationals,

46:16.088 --> 46:18.659
may they continue
to save us ammunition.

46:21.793 --> 46:23.830
Don't let them spoil our memory.

46:27.432 --> 46:29.343
To Ukraine!

46:29.401 --> 46:31.074
All:
Ukraine!

46:31.136 --> 46:33.377
- To freedom!
- All: Freedom!

46:49.988 --> 46:51.558
Hup, hup, ho!

46:52.457 --> 46:53.902
Enough!

46:54.659 --> 46:57.037
Enough of that Ukrainian folk shit!

46:57.896 --> 46:59.842
Play <i>Kalinka</i>!

46:59.898 --> 47:02.276
Long live Joseph Stalin.

47:02.334 --> 47:03.642
Play <i>Kalinka!</i>

47:03.702 --> 47:06.376
No... no, please, please.
No! No! No!

48:31.456 --> 48:33.561
Guard:

48:52.711 --> 48:55.248
Firing Squad Leader: Ready!

48:55.313 --> 48:56.724
Firing Squad Leader:
Aim!

48:58.550 --> 48:59.551
Firing Squad Leader:
Fire!

49:33.151 --> 49:34.687
Prisoner:
Please!

49:34.753 --> 49:37.597
Who will look after my family?
Please!

49:37.656 --> 49:39.567
Firing Squad Leader: Ready!

49:40.525 --> 49:42.368
Firing Squad Leader:
Aim!

49:42.427 --> 49:43.531
Prisoner:
Please!

49:54.105 --> 49:56.346
Hold your fire!

50:32.677 --> 50:33.781
Natalka: Yuri.

50:37.082 --> 50:38.618
Yuri.

50:40.318 --> 50:42.298
Young Natalka: Yuri.

51:57.395 --> 51:59.170
What are you doing?

52:01.800 --> 52:04.872
Kachaniuk, I'm speaking to you.

52:04.936 --> 52:07.109
What's that scratching?

52:07.172 --> 52:09.243
You digging your way out?

52:12.277 --> 52:14.553
- Drawing.
- Drawing?

52:15.447 --> 52:16.983
What?

52:17.916 --> 52:19.361
My wife.

52:39.971 --> 52:41.575
On your knees.

52:45.376 --> 52:46.855
Paint me.

52:51.816 --> 52:54.456
I'll need my...
my paint and my brushes.

52:59.791 --> 53:01.464
And a favor in return.

53:03.194 --> 53:04.434
What?

53:06.064 --> 53:08.237
Let me write
a final letter to my wife.

53:22.647 --> 53:24.718
Yuri: <i>"My darling,</i>

53:24.783 --> 53:26.694
<i>I am in prison for murder.</i>

53:27.452 --> 53:28.988
<i>Mykola is dead...</i>

53:29.621 --> 53:31.532
- Firing Squad Leader: Aim.
<i>- I don't know what happened to Taras,</i>

53:31.589 --> 53:32.863
<i>but I fear the worst.</i>

53:38.129 --> 53:40.632
<i>There is death all around me here.</i>

53:42.734 --> 53:46.011
<i>But having someone to live for
gives me courage and hope.</i>

53:48.206 --> 53:51.016
<i>I will live for you and our child.</i>

53:58.349 --> 54:00.852
<i>I believe with all of my being...</i>

54:02.053 --> 54:04.329
<i>we will be together again."</i>

54:18.503 --> 54:21.177
- Medved: I'll be in with Kachaniuk.
- Guard: Sir.

54:47.365 --> 54:49.402
Medved:
So when can I see it?

54:49.467 --> 54:51.504
Please.
We're almost done.

54:51.569 --> 54:54.778
Make certain you capture my jaw line.
It's my best feature.

54:55.440 --> 54:58.284
Yuri:
No, comrade, it is your eyes.

55:00.845 --> 55:02.119
May I?

55:09.821 --> 55:11.300
There.

55:12.991 --> 55:16.063
The light, it picks up your eyes.

55:16.928 --> 55:19.135
Illuminates your soul.

55:19.197 --> 55:22.804
Please stay exactly as you are.

55:24.702 --> 55:27.376
My eyes are good, but, uh...

55:27.438 --> 55:30.078
I really must see
what sort of work you've done so...

55:44.222 --> 55:46.133
You have no soul.

57:15.380 --> 57:17.587
Natalishka.

57:21.486 --> 57:23.090
It's all right.

58:09.700 --> 58:12.237
It's for you. Put it on.

58:22.547 --> 58:23.753
Wait.

59:15.299 --> 59:19.338
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

59:22.306 --> 59:24.946
We must save ourselves or die.

59:27.512 --> 59:29.617
Mm, yes.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.557
Borscht with mushrooms,
my favorite.

59:32.984 --> 59:35.794
- Did your mother used to make...
- Never mention her.

59:36.888 --> 59:38.629
Never.

59:51.969 --> 59:53.915
Do you make love
as well as you cook?

01:00:47.592 --> 01:00:49.230
You poisoned me.

01:00:49.293 --> 01:00:50.897
No. No.

01:00:50.962 --> 01:00:51.997
No, Commissar.

01:00:52.063 --> 01:00:53.872
- Kiss me, you, bitch.
- Commissar. No!

01:00:54.632 --> 01:00:56.009
. Ow!
. No!

01:00:57.702 --> 01:01:00.478
No! No!

01:01:00.538 --> 01:01:02.381
. No!

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:07.148
Please! No, don't!

01:01:15.753 --> 01:01:18.597
Mama!

01:01:42.113 --> 01:01:43.148
Oh, Natalka.

01:01:45.182 --> 01:01:47.423
You're safe.

01:01:50.388 --> 01:01:52.800
I didn't dishonor the family.

01:01:56.227 --> 01:01:59.071
Here.
It's written by Stalin.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.837
I took it from
the commissar's headquarters.

01:02:00.898 --> 01:02:02.377
There's revolts happening
around the country,

01:02:02.433 --> 01:02:04.276
something the regime keeps silent.

01:02:04.335 --> 01:02:06.781
We must continue the resistance.

01:02:07.238 --> 01:02:10.344
The women will organize a revolt.
We'll be less likely to be shot.

01:02:10.408 --> 01:02:12.115
Women:
Give us back our grain!

01:02:12.176 --> 01:02:14.782
Food for the people!

01:02:14.845 --> 01:02:16.188
We want our grain!

01:02:16.247 --> 01:02:18.750
You want us to starve?!
Is that what you want?!

01:02:34.632 --> 01:02:36.168
Dmitri: Hold your fire!

01:02:41.072 --> 01:02:42.073
Maria!

01:02:43.207 --> 01:02:44.584
Maria!

01:02:49.046 --> 01:02:51.287
Maria.

01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:53.926
Maria!

01:02:53.984 --> 01:02:55.759
No!

01:03:10.101 --> 01:03:12.377
Vlodio...

01:03:12.436 --> 01:03:13.642
look at me.

01:03:14.538 --> 01:03:16.575
It's your fault
your wife was killed.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.645
- I should have you all shot.
- Please, Commissar, have mercy.

01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:22.122
Mother.

01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:24.318
Vlodio:
Please, Commissar...

01:03:24.382 --> 01:03:26.623
let me bury her.

01:03:28.586 --> 01:03:30.930
I don't know where my children are.

01:03:30.988 --> 01:03:34.492
- Without Maria...
- I am a compassionate man.

01:03:34.558 --> 01:03:36.595
I will prove to you that I am merciful,

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.664
and that the Soviet system is just.

01:03:40.865 --> 01:03:42.538
I will release you.

01:03:43.567 --> 01:03:46.047
You can bury your wife.

01:03:46.103 --> 01:03:47.912
But you must promise me

01:03:47.972 --> 01:03:49.952
you'll join the collective.

01:04:10.294 --> 01:04:11.864
Rot in hell.

01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:13.465
I'll see you there.

01:05:04.582 --> 01:05:06.960
Marko, come.

01:05:51.862 --> 01:05:54.069
What would you give
to save your family?

01:05:55.432 --> 01:05:56.706
Everything.

01:05:58.569 --> 01:06:00.139
Except my soul.

01:06:04.475 --> 01:06:07.649
Wash my feet.

01:06:34.405 --> 01:06:35.850
Now dry them.

01:06:41.712 --> 01:06:42.884
No.

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:45.624
With your hair.

01:06:56.961 --> 01:06:58.031
Dry them!

01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:06.540
Bring me the icon of Saint Yuri.

01:07:14.478 --> 01:07:16.981
And you and your family will be free.

01:07:29.159 --> 01:07:31.036
- This is blasphemy.
- No.

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:36.771
It's freedom.

01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:23.483
We've been watching.
You aren't a Soviet.

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:27.589
- Who are you?
- Yuri...

01:09:28.178 --> 01:09:29.179
Kachaniuk.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.283
And you?

01:09:31.348 --> 01:09:32.691
Lubko Stefaniuk.

01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:35.024
We are orphans.

01:09:36.453 --> 01:09:39.059
- Where is your village?
- Nearby, but it's not safe.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:42.367
Will you help us?

01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:48.232
Yes.

01:09:56.807 --> 01:09:58.718
Lubko, do you know
where the train station is?

01:09:59.643 --> 01:10:01.486
I need to get to Smila.

01:10:07.084 --> 01:10:09.496
Are we going to
shoot each other or eat?

01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:11.464
It depends.

01:10:11.989 --> 01:10:14.435
- Who are you?
- They're friends.

01:10:14.491 --> 01:10:17.597
- Who are you?
- Yuri Kachaniuk.

01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:21.074
- From Smila.
- Kachaniuk?

01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:25.169
- My grandfather was Ivan.
- The Wild Boar?

01:10:25.235 --> 01:10:26.236
Yes.

01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:30.012
My grandfather fought with him.

01:10:31.475 --> 01:10:33.477
He saved his platoon,
appeared out of nowhere.

01:10:33.544 --> 01:10:34.579
He's a legend.

01:10:37.848 --> 01:10:40.158
If you're his grandson,
you can fight with us.

01:10:40.217 --> 01:10:43.460
Tomorrow, with the local villagers,
we'll ambush a Soviet unit.

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:16.390
Man: We'll give the bastards
no breathing room,

01:11:16.453 --> 01:11:17.864
no chance to regroup.

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:40.553
Forward, brothers!

01:11:44.414 --> 01:11:45.518
No!

01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.560
No!

01:13:38.762 --> 01:13:40.673
Yuri, wake up!

01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:42.967
We have to go now!

01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:51.419
Lubko:
Please... take me with you.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:54.319
I'll take you to the train.

01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:57.219
Please!
You promised to help me.

01:14:23.907 --> 01:14:26.547
Lubko: Come on.
There's a boxcar at the end of the train.

01:14:41.191 --> 01:14:42.568
We'll be safe in here.

01:15:06.316 --> 01:15:07.886
Somebody take me.

01:15:08.752 --> 01:15:10.390
Woman: Save my child.

01:15:43.653 --> 01:15:45.098
We're here.

01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:04.147
- Lubko: Soviet thief!
- Hey!

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.615
Yvgeny?

01:16:18.121 --> 01:16:19.532
Get in the truck.

01:16:20.257 --> 01:16:21.600
Now.

01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:02.302
Do you know what you've done
to our country?

01:17:02.699 --> 01:17:03.803
Yuri!

01:17:04.434 --> 01:17:06.436
You have destroyed everything.

01:17:06.503 --> 01:17:08.073
I was in the Red Army.

01:17:08.605 --> 01:17:12.417
I know Ukrainians are starving,
Kazakhstanis, Byelorussian, Jews.

01:17:13.376 --> 01:17:14.821
But I was under orders.

01:17:14.878 --> 01:17:16.653
- Orders?
- Yuri, no!

01:17:16.713 --> 01:17:17.851
Pull over.

01:17:21.151 --> 01:17:22.152
Out.

01:17:28.158 --> 01:17:30.035
This grain,

01:17:30.093 --> 01:17:32.004
how long will it
keep your people alive?

01:17:32.495 --> 01:17:35.738
If I can save one life,
that's enough for me.

01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:38.835
Lubko: Yuri.

01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:42.505
Woman: Kill him.

01:17:43.707 --> 01:17:45.311
He's a Soviet.

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.718
They're starving us all.

01:17:46.776 --> 01:17:48.551
Kill him.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.915
Lubko: No.

01:17:57.687 --> 01:17:59.223
Woman: Kill him!

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:29.421
How do I know
you won't turn us in?

01:18:36.159 --> 01:18:37.832
I could have shot you at any time.

01:18:54.844 --> 01:18:56.380
Yuri: Vlodio.

01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:59.426
Vlodio, it's me.

01:19:01.151 --> 01:19:02.152
Yuri.

01:19:04.054 --> 01:19:06.159
I thought you were dead.

01:19:06.956 --> 01:19:09.459
Maria?

01:19:10.226 --> 01:19:11.967
Marko, the children?

01:19:17.133 --> 01:19:18.271
I... I'm sorry.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.846
Vlodio, I have a truck full of grain.

01:19:24.074 --> 01:19:25.712
Feed the people.

01:19:25.775 --> 01:19:27.118
Then come to my home.

01:19:29.312 --> 01:19:30.484
Is it still there?

01:19:35.985 --> 01:19:37.089
Come.

01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:35.087
You're...

01:20:35.145 --> 01:20:36.556
you're alive!

01:20:37.781 --> 01:20:39.158
Thank God.

01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:43.889
Oh, forgive me.

01:20:43.953 --> 01:20:45.193
For what?

01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:46.734
That I've been gone too long.

01:20:53.062 --> 01:20:54.268
Let me look at you.

01:20:54.931 --> 01:20:55.966
Sorry.

01:20:56.599 --> 01:20:58.909
What could you possibly
be sorry for?

01:20:58.968 --> 01:21:01.244
Oh, Yuri.

01:21:02.005 --> 01:21:04.542
I lost our baby.

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.327
We have our own miracle.

01:21:22.926 --> 01:21:23.996
Lubko!

01:21:26.162 --> 01:21:27.232
Lubko!

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:41.314
This is Lubko.
He saved my life.

01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:43.618
And he has no parents.

01:21:45.748 --> 01:21:48.024
He has us now.

01:22:00.964 --> 01:22:02.637
Natalka: Yuri.

01:22:16.379 --> 01:22:17.483
Mama.

01:22:18.648 --> 01:22:20.286
It's me.
We're here.

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:27.768
Try to eat a little piece.

01:22:30.093 --> 01:22:31.265
Just a little.

01:22:39.502 --> 01:22:40.776
Woman: Please.

01:22:42.639 --> 01:22:43.640
What is it?

01:22:44.207 --> 01:22:46.983
Soup... of thistle and grass.

01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:55.359
God has forgiven us.

01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:00.164
What'd He possibly
have to forgive us for?

01:23:03.693 --> 01:23:04.694
Yuri...

01:23:05.628 --> 01:23:06.834
What?

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:10.402
I traded the icon for food.

01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:14.680
I had to,
to save your grandfather.

01:23:14.737 --> 01:23:17.445
But Sergei lied
and still has him prisoner.

01:23:24.847 --> 01:23:25.848
It's okay.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:46.409
I have been painting icons
of Saint Yuri since I was a child.

01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:48.748
What you traded...

01:23:50.974 --> 01:23:52.248
was merely one of them.

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:54.749
This is the real icon.

01:24:08.758 --> 01:24:09.793
Mama.

01:24:11.494 --> 01:24:12.598
You see?

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:15.503
God has not forsaken you.

01:24:42.058 --> 01:24:43.264
Mama?

01:24:45.328 --> 01:24:47.205
Mama?

01:24:47.664 --> 01:24:48.665
Mama?

01:24:58.775 --> 01:25:02.222
She's at peace...
with your father.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.050
She's with him now.

01:25:18.294 --> 01:25:19.432
You must hide this.

01:25:22.465 --> 01:25:23.910
We are the safe keepers now.

01:25:24.967 --> 01:25:26.173
We'll take it with us.

01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:27.339
Natalka: Where?

01:25:27.403 --> 01:25:29.314
We'll cross into Poland.

01:25:29.372 --> 01:25:31.978
Then make our way
to Canada, America,

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:33.952
where we can tell the world
what Stalin is doing

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:35.751
to the people of Ukraine.

01:25:35.812 --> 01:25:38.019
But first I must free my grandfather.

01:25:39.215 --> 01:25:40.285
Wait.

01:25:43.953 --> 01:25:45.489
We still have
your grandfather's Sabre.

01:26:07.443 --> 01:26:08.683
Man:
Plenty more.

01:26:58.327 --> 01:26:59.465
Come on.

01:27:03.232 --> 01:27:04.302
Dido.

01:27:08.671 --> 01:27:11.174
We're leaving tonight, for Lviv.

01:27:16.045 --> 01:27:19.151
Forgive me.
I'm such an old fool.

01:27:30.092 --> 01:27:31.093
Dmitri.

01:27:32.461 --> 01:27:33.462
Dido.

01:28:14.303 --> 01:28:16.476
It's about time
I killed you, old man.

01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:37.166
Go ahead, kill me.

01:28:38.294 --> 01:28:40.274
My grandson will have his revenge.

01:28:42.031 --> 01:28:43.135
The painter?

01:28:45.234 --> 01:28:46.611
The warrior.

01:30:43.019 --> 01:30:44.521
We'll be free.

01:30:45.921 --> 01:30:48.731
Have a farm, more children.

01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:03.473
It's the river.
We're at the border.

01:31:05.374 --> 01:31:07.047
We'll soon be in Poland.

01:31:36.238 --> 01:31:37.615
<i>Davai!</i>

01:31:52.254 --> 01:31:53.255
Soldier: <i>Strelay!</i>

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.074
Lubko: Natalka!

01:32:27.756 --> 01:32:30.066
- Go without me.
- No. Not this time.

01:32:30.126 --> 01:32:32.299
Natalka, come on.

01:32:32.361 --> 01:32:34.432
We'll be together.

01:33:23.646 --> 01:33:25.887
<i>My name is Yuri Kachaniuk.</i>

01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.021
<i>The son of Yaroslav Kachaniuk...</i>

01:33:33.255 --> 01:33:36.725
<i>and the grandson
of the famous warrior</i>

01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:38.829
<i>Ivan Kachaniuk.</i>

01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:44.409
<i>Before I grew up and learned
that dragons were real...</i>

01:33:46.268 --> 01:33:48.714
<i>and evil roamed the world...</i>

01:33:51.173 --> 01:33:52.709
<i>I fell in love.</i>

01:33:53.305 --> 01:33:59.460
