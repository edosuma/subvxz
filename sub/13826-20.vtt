you into atoms?

stole the key

The place he keeps all the loot he's
stolen throughout the galaxy?

-I thought that place was a myth.
-Aw, it's real, all right.

you'd be helping a

Never tried one of those before.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.061
No time like the present.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.230
Okay, I'm on it.

12:51.522 --> 12:55.192
Tiny question. What does 9,699 mean?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.401
Got it, chief.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.584
Can I adjust the vector?

13:12.668 --> 13:14.837
You don't even know what that means.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.880
I can check the oil.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.676
Just sit down!

13:30.185 --> 13:32.396

13:40.237 --> 13:42.948
-That was...
-(SYLVIA SCREAMS) Awesome!

13:46.952 --> 13:50.122
Nothin' better than a rip-roarin'
adventure, eh, Sylvia,

13:50.205 --> 13:52.624
-old girl?
-Nope. Nothin'.

13:55.043 --> 14:02.009
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:04.344 --> 14:08.098
Wow, guys, that was amazing! You two
really do make a

14:08.182 --> 14:12.603
pretty good (THUDS) team.

14:14.438 --> 14:21.320
(SAD PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

14:38.712 --> 14:44.009
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:50.265 --> 14:52.518
Nice. Wait, where's Wander?

14:52.726 --> 14:53.936
Hm, I don't know.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.647
I lost track of him after that
awesome space chase.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.773
Am I right, partner?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.816
We should probably go find him.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.237
That little freaky furball? All he's done
is get in our way.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.363
(SYLVIA GROANS)

15:04.446 --> 15:07.574
All right, all right. But let's finish the
mission first

15:07.658 --> 15:09.743
Hater's main treasure room is just ahead.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.463
SYLVIA: Good grop!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.966
(RYDER CHEERING)

15:26.510 --> 15:28.011
I'm rich! I'm so rich!

15:28.095 --> 15:30.264
I'm gonna buy a big galactic cruiser, and

15:30.389 --> 15:32.641
a little one to go inside the big one.
Ha ha!

15:32.724 --> 15:36.395
Wait, You're rich?

15:36.562 --> 15:40.232
What happened to giving this stuff back to
the people Hater stole it from?

15:40.315 --> 15:43.110
Please, you didn't really believe that,
did you?

15:43.235 --> 15:44.403
(SYLVIA GROWLS)

15:44.486 --> 15:45.612
You did.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.448
That little weirdo is turning you all
kinds of soft.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.908
Oh thank grop I came along.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.620
Hey, just 'cause Wander likes helping out
doesn't make him soft.

15:53.704 --> 15:57.457
Sure, it does. While he's out there givin'
out free hugs or something, we're

15:57.541 --> 16:00.460
in here with all the treasure. We win!

16:00.544 --> 16:04.339

16:11.430 --> 16:14.057
What'll it be? Number 19? Number 46?

16:14.308 --> 16:19.730
I'm thinkin' number one. As in, lookin'
out for. So long, Syl.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.690
Told you you'd come in handy.

(ZAP)

(RYDER SCREAMING)

16:25.569 --> 16:26.820
Not good at all.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.704
WANDER: Now, Wander, don't be selfish.
If Sylvia wants to have

16:35.787 --> 16:38.790
hardcore, violent, inconsiderate
space adventures

16:38.874 --> 16:41.835
with a guy like Ryder, you gotta let her.

16:42.127 --> 16:48.967
You'll just have to find another partner
someone strong, and smart. And brave.

16:49.051 --> 16:53.764
Someone who, though they act all tough,
has a creamy center of gooey goodness.

16:53.972 --> 16:58.185
And when you inevitably get yourself into
trouble in situations, they'll always find

16:58.268 --> 17:02.981
a way to get you out, no matter how
bad things seem.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.070
(CREATURE HISSING)

17:09.404 --> 17:12.491
Look, fella, her and the little
furry guy are who Hater

17:12.574 --> 17:15.869
really want. Let me go and I'll make a
deal with...

17:17.120 --> 17:21.375
Oh, I always forget what a jerk Ryder was,
and what a jerk he makes me.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.963
I let the only partner who's ever seen the
good in me just "wander" away.

17:26.338 --> 17:31.385
Flab drassit. I'm sure gonna miss the
goofy little guy. The way he'd mess up a

17:31.468 --> 17:33.637
plan just to do something nice.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.390
And he'd always find some crazy way to get
out of it.

17:36.682 --> 17:39.726
It's like he's magic.

17:39.810 --> 17:43.480
Lady, I'm sorry you lost your dog or
whatever, but nobody cares.

17:45.732 --> 17:51.196
-Sylvia!
-Wander? What, how, who?

17:51.280 --> 17:54.074
Remember that time on Kee-ton 6?

17:54.241 --> 17:57.828
When we helped the immensapede find his
missing contact lens?

17:57.911 --> 18:00.247
Turns out, this is his cousin.

18:02.791 --> 18:07.963
(SIGHS) Oh, Sylvia, I know you and Ryder
are all tough and cool,

18:08.046 --> 18:10.966
-and I'm often not, but...
-Are you kidding?

18:11.049 --> 18:14.261
You remember the time you busted into
Hater's secret storage unit

18:14.344 --> 18:17.181
on a giant space worm just to
help your best friend?

18:17.264 --> 18:20.434
-(SCREAMING NOISES)
-That was pretty cool.

18:23.270 --> 18:27.733
Would you say us being friends is the
greatest adventure of all?

18:27.816 --> 18:34.406
No, because that would be way too sappy.
But I'm kinda thinkin' it.

18:34.907 --> 18:36.658
(WANDER SQUEALS)

18:36.742 --> 18:37.910
Frederick!

18:37.993 --> 18:40.621
Thanks so much for the advice.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.955
It totally worked.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.166
Why, that's spectacular, Wander.

18:44.249 --> 18:48.378
Remember, acknowledging your differences
can often make a relationship even richer.

LORD HATER: What is going on here?

18:56.094 --> 18:58.764
Oh, Wander. Why am I not surprised?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.557
Sorry about the mess.

19:00.641 --> 19:03.393
But I was asking a space worm,
about friendship and...

19:03.477 --> 19:05.354
I don't care! Seize them!

19:08.190 --> 19:09.441

oughta celebrate you, Barry.

secret, man. Barry was born!

19:37.010 --> 19:38.136
Stop them!

19:38.470 --> 19:41.932
You're embarrassing both me
and yourselves!

19:42.724 --> 19:44.184
Dreadfully sorry,

19:44.268 --> 19:47.855
but I think I knocked over something
rather important during my rampage.

19:48.438 --> 19:54.236

well, exploded. Cheerio!

to come, too. I have a hustle
