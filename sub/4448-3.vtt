‐ OH, YEAH.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.626
BRIGGS DOESN'T

I BUILT THE WHOLE THING.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.302
YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED
THAT HOUSE.

HE KNOWS ME.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.244
I'LL TELL SAM
WE CAN HOOK HIM UP.

‐ IT'S JUST, I THINK, YOU KNOW,
HE'S KIND OF A KINGPIN,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.734
AND 25% IS A BIT
MORE REASONABLE.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.569
‐ IT'S 20%.
THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNMENT PAYS,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.404

OKAY?

13:53.207 --> 13:56.127
I MEAN, I WISH
I COULD TURN BACK THE CLOCK.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.628
‐ BUT YOU CAN'T.
‐ NO.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.466
‐ SO FOCUS ON
THIS FANTASTIC DOLLHOUSE

14:01.507 --> 14:03.718
THAT YOU'RE SO GREAT AT.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.136
MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL
AND GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER,

14:05.178 --> 14:06.345
AND SHE'LL BE HAPPY.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.347
‐ YOU'RE RIGHT, CHARLIE.
‐ ALL RIGHT?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.808

I'M SO CLEAR IT HURTS, BRO.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.840
LAUREN, THIS BETTER
BE WORTH IT.

14:42.924 --> 14:43.925
‐ OH, IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.301
‐ WE'VE SPOTTED THE TRUCK‐‐

14:45.384 --> 14:46.928
A HALF A MILE AWAY
AND CLOSING.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.262
‐ OKAY, KIDS,
OUR TARGET IS CLOSING.

WAY TOO HIGH.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.656
THERE'S NO WAY
THERE'S CARS IN THERE.

‐ NO, NO, NO,
THEY'RE IN THERE, PAUL.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.368
‐ NO, HE'S RIGHT.
THOSE AXLES ARE TOO HIGH.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.496
‐ JOHNNY, KILL THE MISSION.
KILL IT RIGHT NOW. ABORT.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.497
‐ COPY THAT. COPY THAT.
ABORT!

15:14.539 --> 15:15.748
‐ DON'T DO THIS.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.959

HE KNOWS YOU'RE DEA NOW.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.962
‐ SO WE HOLD HIM

17:16.744 --> 17:19.664
SHE RAN RIGHT OUT
IN FRONT OF THAT TRUCK.

"HI, I'M SPECIAL AGENT
MIKE WARREN.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.320

ASK ME WHY I CHOSE THAT
FOR HIM.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.764
‐ WHY'D YOU CHOOSE THAT
FOR PHIL?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.057
‐ LOOK AT HIM.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.517
DOES HE LOOK LIKE
A CARDIOLOGIST TO YOU?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.562
OKAY, YOU PICK AN ALIAS
THEY WOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.188

TOO MANY QUESTIONS,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.983
AND THEY DON'T FIND OUT WHAT
THEY SHOULDN'T, RIGHT, RIGHT.

18:29.066 --> 18:33.613
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
‐ HMM?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.031
I'M A PILOT.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.612
WATCH AND LEARN,
MY YOUNG FRIEND.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.657
‐ THAT DUDE PLAYS THE SAME
THREE CHORDS EVERY TIME.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.494
OVER AND OVER...AND OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.163
‐ [chuckles]

19:24.246 --> 19:25.539
I SWEAR, IT'S TRUE.

19:25.623 --> 19:30.711
THE MORE I DRINK,
THE BETTER AND BETTER I GET.

19:30.795 --> 19:31.921
[door opens]

19:31.962 --> 19:33.589
‐ GOD DAMN, ALINA.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.841
‐ AW, JUMPY?
‐ [sighs]

19:35.925 --> 19:39.011
‐ EVERYBODY IS.
THE FBI AND DEA HIT US TODAY.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.721
‐ WHAT? WHERE?

19:40.805 --> 19:42.139
‐ THEY GOT NOTHING.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.101
VIKTOR GOT STOPPED
BY SOME CRAZY DEA CHICK

19:45.142 --> 19:47.144
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROAD.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.813
‐ SO THE LAMBORGHINI THING
IS OFF?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.565
‐ NOTHING'S OFF.
SCREW THE FBI.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.652
THE CARS STAY IN WOODLAND HILLS
UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.321
‐ NO POKER TONIGHT.
‐ NO.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.532
WE'RE GOING TO GRAB CHINESE.
YOU HUNGRY?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.200
‐ AH, I JUST ATE.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.160
POKER SOON?
‐ SURE.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.539
I LOVE TO TAKE YOUR MONEY.
‐ [chuckles]

20:09.083 --> 20:11.585
‐ HEY, VIKTOR...

20:17.007 --> 20:19.510
‐ NICE ASS.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.929
‐ [chuckles]

20:21.971 --> 20:24.140
‐ I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT
ON THE PGA TOUR.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.642
RIGHT NOW, I'M TEACHING
PRIVATELY TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.644
‐ THAT'S SO GREAT.
SO YOU PLAY AT SPYGLASS, RIGHT?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.354
‐ SPYGLASS, MANY TIMES.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.148
OLD SPYGLASS, RIGHT?
‐ YES.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.150
MY DAD IS A HUGE GOLFER.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.651
I PRACTICALLY GREW UP THERE.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.320
‐ PAUL!
OVER HERE.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.823
‐ WHAT'S WRONG?

20:40.906 --> 20:42.324
‐ SEE THAT GUY
WHO JUST WALKED IN?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.868
‐ OH, NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.
‐ HE'S AN ASTRONAUT.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.662
HE WAS THE LAST GUY TO RIDE
IN THE <i>ENDEAVOR.</i>

20:46.746 --> 20:51.000
‐ THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
[chuckles]

20:51.041 --> 20:52.168
WHY‐‐WHY ARE YOU HIDING
FROM HIM?

20:52.251 --> 20:56.130
‐ [sighs]
I KINDA GAVE HIM A WRONG NUMBER.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.049
I'M REALLY SORRY,
I GOTTA GO.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.553
THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.931
‐ CAN I HAVE MY TAB?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.725
‐ OH, ACTUALLY,
THAT GUY RIGHT OVER THERE

21:07.808 --> 21:09.477
ALREADY PAID
FOR YOUR DRINKS.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.605
‐ HMM.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.814
‐ BUT CHARGE WHAT YOU WANT,

21:13.856 --> 21:15.274
MY MAN PAUL IS PAYING
FOR ALL THIS.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.027
‐ YOU KNOW IT.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.820
‐ PARDON ME.
‐ AHH.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.655
‐ SMARTEST THING
YOU COULD HAVE SAID.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.157
MIKEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.617
‐ YEAH, HER DAD WAS
A GOLFER.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.203
[laughter]

21:27.286 --> 21:29.747
HEY, THANKS FOR THE DRINKS,
CAPTAIN LIGHTYEAR.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.290
AN ASTRONAUT? REALLY?
‐ YEAH.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.917
WELL, YOU KNOW,
DIDN'T END WELL.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.293
I NEVER CALLED HER.
‐ [chuckles]

21:34.376 --> 21:36.504
‐ ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET YOU
BACK UP ON THAT HORSE.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.964
COME ON.
‐ KID'S IN FOR A LONG NIGHT.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.218
‐ MAKE ME PROUD, SON.

22:02.196 --> 22:06.033
‐ VERY HIGH QUALITY.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.326
VERY PURE.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.119
‐ I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NOT THE BLUE,

22:09.161 --> 22:12.373
BUT IT IS SERIOUS.

22:12.456 --> 22:16.627
‐ $500,000 FOR 50 POUNDS.
THAT'S THE DEAL.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.129
‐ LET ME SEE THE MONEY.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.674
‐ OKAY, WE WAIT
FOR THE "GO" WORD.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.471
‐ HOLD ON.

22:27.555 --> 22:31.475
WITH ALL THESE‐‐
WITH ALL THESE BUSTS GOING DOWN,

22:31.517 --> 22:33.143
SUPPLY IS SHORT.
‐ WHAT IS THE LITTLE TWIT DOING?

22:33.227 --> 22:34.311
‐ AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT?

22:34.395 --> 22:35.855
‐ HE'S TRYING TO JACK UP
THE PRICE

22:35.938 --> 22:36.856
TO INCREASE HIS CUT.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.482
‐ IT SEEMS A LITTLE LOW,

22:38.566 --> 22:41.068
GIVEN PRESENT
MARKET CONDITIONS.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.237
I MEAN,
IT'S WORTH DISCUSSING.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.573
‐ YOU RENEGOTIATE NOW?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.575
‐ IT'S $500,000, ALL RIGHT?

22:47.658 --> 22:50.035
LET'S JUST
DO THIS THING ALREADY.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.996
‐ THE PAY SEEMS LOW,
THE QUALITY IS HIGH,

22:52.037 --> 22:55.666
AND WE'RE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.167
YOU GUYS CAN PISS OFF.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.461
‐ WAIT, WAIT. NO, NO, NO.
FORGET WHISTLER.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.505
HE DOESN'T KNOW A GOOD THING
WHEN IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.882
IT'S $500,000.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.259
‐ FINE. YOUR FRIEND SHUTS UP,
WE HAVE A DEAL.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.803
‐ GREAT.
LET'S JUST ZIP IT UP,

23:07.845 --> 23:10.180
AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.
‐ OKAY, THAT'S OUR SIGNAL.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.807
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

23:11.849 --> 23:13.309
HANDS‐‐GET YOUR HANDS UP!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.894

23:17.813 --> 23:18.647
‐ YOU SET ME UP,
I'LL KILL YOU!

23:18.731 --> 23:19.815
I KNOW PEOPLE.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.108

HOOD OF THE CAR!

23:21.150 --> 23:23.819
HOOD OF THE CAR!
‐ I'LL KILL YOU.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.821
‐ YOU'RE A NITWIT,
YOU KNOW THAT?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.781
‐ I WAS JUST PLAYING.
‐ YOU WERE JUST PLAYING?

23:27.823 --> 23:29.700
‐ WE GOT THE BAD GUY.
WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.493
WHEN DO I GET MY MONEY?
‐ YOUR MONEY?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.370
‐ I'M GONNA SHOVE YOUR MONEY
UP YOUR ASS.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.845
‐ WHERE YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT?

23:49.929 --> 23:52.139
‐ DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:52.222 --> 23:56.769
‐ NO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT.
COME HERE.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.647
‐ I‐I'M JUST TIRED, BRIGGS.
I NEED SOME SLEEP.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.902
‐ HEY...
WHO DID THAT TO YOU?

24:04.985 --> 24:08.489
HMM?
TALK TO ME, KIDDO.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.992
‐ KUSMANOV.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.036
I'M AN IDIOT.
I WENT TO THE WAREHOUSE

24:14.119 --> 24:16.747
IN WOODLAND HILLS TO SEE
IF THE CARS WERE THERE,

24:16.830 --> 24:19.917
AND HE CAUGHT ME
SNOOPING AROUND.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.460
‐ AND I GUESS HE NEEDED
A PUNCHING BAG?

24:21.543 --> 24:24.463
‐ I'LL BE FINE.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.840
I'M SORRY, PAUL.
I JUST‐‐

24:26.924 --> 24:30.761
I JUST HAD TO KNOW
I WASN'T CRAZY.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.638
‐ AND WERE THEY THERE?

24:32.721 --> 24:34.682
DID YOU SEE THE LOJACKED CARS
IN THE WAREHOUSE?

24:34.765 --> 24:38.560
‐ YEAH.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.147

25:07.589 --> 25:10.467
[television chatter]

25:10.551 --> 25:12.344
‐ I FINISHED THE DOLLHOUSE.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.222
‐ I SEE THAT.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.099
ARE YOU HIGH?

25:17.141 --> 25:19.143
‐ JUST CELEBRATING.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.646
MY SISTER'S
STILL KICKING ME OUT.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.152
‐ WHISTLER...

25:28.193 --> 25:30.946
I CAN'T USE YOU
AS A C.I. ANYMORE.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.115
‐ W‐WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.534
‐ MY SUPERVISOR
SAID YOU'RE TOO RISKY

25:35.617 --> 25:37.494
AND THAT I CAN'T
USE YOU ANYMORE.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.788
‐ WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.373
‐ YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR SH‐‐ TOGETHER,

25:41.457 --> 25:43.625
GO TO A REHAB OR A CLINIC
OR SOMETHING.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.335
‐ NO, REHAB DOESN'T WORK.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.462
‐ IT WORKS
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.546
‐ IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.631
I GOTTA BE...
DOING STUFF.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.925
THEY JUST <i>TALK</i> ABOUT STUFF.
IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.303
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED!

25:54.344 --> 25:57.765
‐ SCREWED? YOU'RE GETTING
A CHECK FOR $100,000.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.976
THAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF SCREWED.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.438
‐ WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITHOUT YOU, CHARLIE?

26:04.480 --> 26:08.650
‐ YOU GOTTA GROW UP, MAN.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.570

26:17.159 --> 26:20.370
DID YOU AT LEAST FIGHT

26:23.624 --> 26:25.959

27:54.381 --> 27:56.091
‐ I KNOW.
SHE CAN'T COUNT OR WHAT?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.551
NICE CARS, DICKHEADS.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.678
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER
EVER TELL YOU SPEED KILLS?

27:59.761 --> 28:01.346
‐ HOW'S THE ARM?
‐ HE SLICED ME

28:01.430 --> 28:02.306
LIKE A FRIGGIN' MANGO,
MAN.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.640
IT'S ALL RIGHT, THOUGH.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.143
GOOD STORY

MUCH MATTER, NOW DOES IT?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.967
BECAUSE AS FAR
AS ANYONE ELSE IS CONCERNED,

28:39.009 --> 28:40.677
I WAS NEVER HERE.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.180

29:48.704 --> 29:51.999
‐ HEY, LOOK, COME HERE.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.084
OKAY, DON'T LOOK NOW,

29:54.126 --> 29:56.795
BUT THERE IS A PRETTY GIRL
AT THE BAR

29:56.878 --> 30:00.716
THAT HAS BEEN STARING AT YOU
ALL NIGHT.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.426
‐ [giggles]

30:02.467 --> 30:05.637
‐ [sighs]
‐ GO GET HER.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.305
‐ IT'S BEEN A CRAZY DAY.

30:07.389 --> 30:11.143
I DON'T FEEL LIKE CREATING
SOME ELABORATE LIE RIGHT NOW.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.687
CAN I JUST BE MYSELF
AND HANG WITH YOU GUYS?

30:13.770 --> 30:14.980
ALL RIGHT?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.648
‐ WELL, I WANT TO HOOK UP
WITH SOMEONE,

30:16.690 --> 30:18.483
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
WITH YOU BESIDE ME,

30:18.567 --> 30:21.111
SO...HOLD THAT.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.993

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

OKAY.

[irritated laugh]

30:49.139 --> 30:51.266

IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, MIKE.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.439

30:57.481 --> 30:59.316
‐ HEY, LADIES.
‐ NO, NO, NO. NO TOUCHING.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.485
‐ BACK UP. BACK UP.
‐ NO.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.986
‐ MY MAN, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A WALK, BRO?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.529
‐ FREE COUNTRY, CHIEF.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.573
‐ I'LL HAVE A MADRAS, PLEASE.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.450
‐ MADRAS?
WHERE YOU FROM?

31:08.492 --> 31:10.494
‐ BALTIMORE.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.038
‐ VIRGINIA.
MAKE IT TWO.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.873
‐ THANKS.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.125
‐ COME ON...
‐ GET OUT OF MY FACE!

31:17.167 --> 31:18.835
‐ YO, MAN, YOU JUST
DON'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.588
‐ WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HEY! HEY! PAUL!

31:21.630 --> 31:23.507
HEY!
‐ OH, DUDE, YOU GOT THIS, MAN?

31:23.590 --> 31:26.093
‐ YOU ARE OUT OF HERE.
PAUL, HOME! NOW.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.470
‐ THOSE YOUR FRIENDS?
‐ YEAH.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.515
‐ LOOKS LIKE A NICE GROUP.
‐ YES.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.976
‐ YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?

31:35.018 --> 31:37.312
‐ THE GUY NEEDED
A BUDDHIST BEATDOWN.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.899
‐ SOMETHING GOING ON
IN THAT TORTURED HEAD OF YOURS?

31:40.982 --> 31:42.984
‐ THE DRIVER
OF THE RUSSIAN TRUCK.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.195
THE ONE THAT LAUREN
TRIED TO ARREST THE OTHER DAY.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.988
JAKES SAID HE SAW HIM
AT THE WAREHOUSE TODAY.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.074
‐ SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HE SAW LAUREN?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.743
‐ I'M JUST‐‐
I'M TRYING TO ADD THINGS UP.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.496
LAUREN GOES TO THE WAREHOUSE.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.873
KUSMANOV CATCHES HER
AND BEATS HER UP.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.626
‐ IF THE DRIVER SAW HER,
SHE'D BE DEAD, NOT BRUISED.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.961
‐ WOULD SHE BE DEAD?

32:01.044 --> 32:03.922
‐ MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO KILL A FED.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.133
‐ ALL RIGHT.
BUT WHY LET HER GO?

32:11.596 --> 32:13.306
‐ THE LOJACKS
THEY PUT ON THOSE CARS‐‐

32:13.348 --> 32:15.809
THEY COULD HAVE JUST
AS EASILY PUT ONE ON LAUREN.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.604
‐ THEY COULD.
‐ THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

32:19.646 --> 32:23.316
I MEAN, THEY LEFT HER ALIVE
SO THAT THEY COULD TRACK HER

32:23.400 --> 32:25.402
AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH SHE KNOWS
ABOUT THE OPERATION.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.864
‐ YEAH, IT FEELS RIGHT.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.783
‐ AND IF THE RUSSIANS
ARE TRACKING LAUREN,

32:31.825 --> 32:34.327
SHE IS LEADING THEM
STRAIGHT BACK HERE.

32:34.411 --> 32:37.205
‐ HEY, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

32:37.289 --> 32:39.040
‐ WHEN LAUREN GETS HOME,
I HAVE TO FIND OUT.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.418
I HAVE TO TELL THE DEA.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.471
‐ UH...ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S SOMETHING

32:53.513 --> 32:55.849
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HERE.
‐ OKAY.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.476
‐ SO YOU GO TO WELLESLEY...
GEORGETOWN LAW,

32:58.560 --> 33:00.604
WHICH‐‐LET ME JUST SAY,

33:00.645 --> 33:02.480
THAT IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE
EDUCATION, BY THE WAY.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.400
‐ I COASTED.
DIDN'T DO A LICK OF WORK.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.027
‐ YOU'RE A LIAR.
‐ I AM.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.820
[laughter]

33:08.862 --> 33:12.324
‐ SO WHY AREN'T YOU
TAKING THE BAR THIS SUMMER?

33:12.365 --> 33:14.326
‐ MY DAD TOLD ME NOT TO.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.746
I'VE BEEN GOING NONSTOP
SINCE I WAS NINE,

33:17.829 --> 33:20.290
SO HE TOLD ME
TO TAKE A SUMMER OFF.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.002
GO TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN,
STICK MY TOE IN THE WATER.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.631
DO AND SEE LIFE...

33:27.714 --> 33:30.467
BEFORE I GET LOCKED
IN AN OFFICE FOREVER.

33:30.508 --> 33:35.555
‐ [chuckles]
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

33:35.639 --> 33:38.433
WHEN MY FRIEND PAIGE
CAME UP TO YOU AT THE BAR,

33:38.475 --> 33:41.478
WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?

33:41.561 --> 33:46.900
‐ SHE SAID,
"THAT GUY IS MIKE,

33:46.983 --> 33:51.780
AND OF ALL OF THE GUYS
IN THE BAR, HE'S REAL."

33:53.073 --> 33:56.493
ARE YOU REAL, MIKE?

34:09.422 --> 34:10.924
‐ [sighs]

34:12.842 --> 34:15.428
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.640
‐ WANNA PLAY FRISBEE?
‐ ACTUALLY, NO.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.642
I HAVEN'T SLEPT YET.
I'M KINDA TIRED.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.769
‐ I WANNA HEAR
ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE,

34:22.811 --> 34:24.020
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

34:24.104 --> 34:26.022
WE HAVE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.
‐ SERIOUSLY?

34:26.106 --> 34:27.983
‐ THERE'S SOMETHING
WE NEED TO GO LOOK FOR.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.819
‐ WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO GO RIGHT BACK THERE.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.989
THE BANK IS THAT WAY.
‐ WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE BANK.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.493
‐ WE'RE GETTING MY CHECK,
RIGHT?

34:42.414 --> 34:44.374
ARE WE MAKING A BUY?

34:44.457 --> 34:47.002
‐ NO.
NOT WITH ME, YOU'RE NOT.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.878
‐ WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

34:48.962 --> 34:51.423
‐ GET OUT OF THE CAR.

34:56.261 --> 35:00.515
‐ WHAT'S GOING ON, CHARLIE?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.309
‐ YOU LIKE THIS PLACE?

35:02.350 --> 35:06.229
‐ IT'S OKAY.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.815
‐ YOU KNOW,
THIS HOUSE CAN BE YOURS.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.275
‐ [chuckles]

35:10.317 --> 35:11.693
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SELL IT
TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.320
‐ YEAH, WELL,
I TALKED TO A REALTOR,

35:13.361 --> 35:15.822
PULLED SOME STRINGS.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.992
‐ I CAN'T AFFORD IT.
‐ YEAH, YOU CAN.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.830
‐ THIS WOULD BE
A LOT OF WORK.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.083
‐ WASN'T THE MAYOR'S HOUSE
A LOT OF WORK?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.252
COME ON, LET'S GO SEE
THE INSIDE.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.553
‐ OOPS, SORRY.
‐ NICE SHOT.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.555
THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.653
‐ GOOD MORNING.
YOU GOT IT?

35:59.407 --> 36:02.035
‐ THEY'RE TRACKING LAUREN.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.125
‐ NOT EXACTLY
THE MAYOR'S MANSION.

36:09.209 --> 36:12.253
‐ YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
THE MAYOR.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.130
BUT YOU ARE
A CRAZY‐TALENTED CARPENTER,

36:14.172 --> 36:15.882
AND I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD
MAKE SOMETHING

36:15.965 --> 36:19.886
REALLY BEAUTIFUL
OUT OF THIS PLACE.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.639
‐ THIS‐‐THIS IS ACTUALLY
NO PROBLEM.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.934
THIS IS NO PROBLEM.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.644
AND THESE‐‐THESE
ARE GONNA BE ORIGINAL.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.813
I WOULDN'T EVEN TOUCH THESE.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.691
AND THAT ROOM BACK THERE,
THAT GETS SOUTHERN EXPOSURE.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.276
I'D JUST KNOCK THAT WALL OUT,
PUT IN FRENCH DOORS

36:35.318 --> 36:39.531
OUT TO THE YARD.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.491
DO NOT PLAY WITH ME,
CHARLIE.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.368
‐ HERE'S THE REALTOR'S CARD.
HE'S EXPECTING YOUR CALL.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.994
THE HOUSE IS
ALREADY OFF THE MARKET.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.788
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS SIGN THE PAPERS

36:46.830 --> 36:48.123
AND GIVE 'EM THIS.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.876
‐ MY CHECK.
‐ YOUR CHECK.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.381
‐ MAKE THIS MY DEN.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.608
JUST GIVE 'EM THE CHECK,
AND THE HOUSE IS YOURS.

37:18.445 --> 37:22.073
‐ OH...
SIT BY THE FIRE.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.826
‐ [laughs]
I COULD SEE THAT.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.251
‐ PAIGE IS UNBELIEVABLE.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.128
THE DEA IS KICKING ME OUT
OF GRACELAND.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.505
‐ PAIGE DIDN'T DO THAT
TO YOU.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.716
IT'S A SELF‐INFLICTED WOUND,
LAUREN.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.468
YOU'RE DAMN LUCKY YOU DIDN'T
MAKE A SPLATTER PATTERN

37:41.509 --> 37:43.303
OUT OF YOUR ENTIRE CAREER,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

37:43.386 --> 37:48.308
SHE FOUND A GODDAMN GPS TRACKER
UNDER YOUR CAR.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.768
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW LUCKY WE ARE

37:49.809 --> 37:51.686
THAT DAMN THING
DIDN'T TRANSMIT, HUH?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.980
IF THEY'D RECOVERED IT
BEFORE PAIGE FOUND IT,

37:54.063 --> 37:55.440
GRACELAND WOULD BE DONE.
‐ IT WASN'T TRANSMITTING,

37:55.482 --> 37:57.025
AND THEY DIDN'T
FIND IT FIRST,

37:57.108 --> 37:59.068
SO THERE'S NO REASON
TO KICK ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.070
‐ UH, YOU WENT BACK
TO KUSMANOV'S

38:01.154 --> 38:02.530
WHEN YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.366
‐ PLEASE, COME ON, PAUL.
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT THIS FOR ME.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.745
‐ HELL NO.
YOU LIED TO ME.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.622
I DON'T GO TO BAT
FOR LIARS, LAUREN.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.290
YOU NEVER WENT
TO THAT WAREHOUSE,

38:12.332 --> 38:14.042
YOU NEVER SAW THOSE CARS.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.127
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY
GODDAMN RUSSIANS WERE IN THERE

38:16.169 --> 38:18.046
BECAUSE YOU
WERE NEVER THERE.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.715
YOU ALMOST
GOT JOHNNY KILLED.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.383
YOU PUT THIS WHOLE HOUSE
IN HARM'S WAY,

38:22.467 --> 38:27.138
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

38:27.222 --> 38:29.015
YOU USED ME.

38:29.098 --> 38:34.729
YOU PLAYED...ME.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.774
KUSMANOV NEVER HIT YOU.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.984
THAT'S RIGHT.
I SAW HIS HANDS.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.153
LAUREN, THEY WERE
AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.072

LOOKS LIKE

38:44.155 --> 38:45.865
