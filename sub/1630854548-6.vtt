01:34.260 --> 01:36.137
I just had the craziest dream.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.847
You were there.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.975
Vic was there,
fucking Willoughby was there,

01:41.059 --> 01:41.893
and I...

01:43.770 --> 01:45.021
I was a fucking baby.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.523
Oh, it was all real.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.359
The parties, the pool,
getting turned into a baby.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.070
You were a fussy,
little stinker, too.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.031
I was starting to get worried
you'd be stuck like that.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.658
I've been big for hours.

01:56.741 --> 02:00.703
- Sorry that sounded weird.
- Then Willoughby...

02:00.787 --> 02:02.705
- He reversed the spell.
- I guess he made it

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
to pound town after all.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.042
Ha! Good for him.

02:06.125 --> 02:09.879
But it looks like
he reversed the spell
a little extra for you.

02:11.923 --> 02:12.757
[gasps]

02:18.680 --> 02:20.807
[whispering] There was
an evil bunny.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.227
It took my longevity!

02:24.310 --> 02:27.355
That Dickensian dickwad
double-crossed us.

02:27.438 --> 02:32.652
That means that Immortus
is about to wipe their ass
with our reality.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.070
Where is everyone?

02:34.153 --> 02:35.405
We have...
We have to stop this.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.490
We have to get
my longevity back.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.035
[Cliff] Can't. I'm in
the middle of putting in
an 850 Holley double pumper.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.036
What?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.373
This is code-fucking-red!

02:45.456 --> 02:47.333
- [Cliff] Hey!
- Look at my hair!

02:47.417 --> 02:48.543
[sobbing]

02:48.626 --> 02:52.755
I feel like shit!
My chest hurts.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.425
It's just acid reflux.
Welcome to middle age.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.759
[Jane] Are you serious
right now?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.428
What if I'm fucking dying?

02:58.511 --> 02:59.846
[Cliff] You wouldn't be
the only one.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.639
Oh...

03:02.891 --> 03:05.435
- [gasps, groans]
- [Larry groans]

03:05.518 --> 03:07.937
Look, I'm sorry I left you
when I did.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.772
If it makes you feel
any better,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.358
I didn't get very far
before my brain
went all goo-goo-gaga,

03:12.442 --> 03:14.152
and I drove into a ditch.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.613
But when I turned back
to normal,
I went right back for you.

03:16.696 --> 03:21.451
There you were, a little baby
crying outside the pool center,
all alone.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.787
That's the kind of thing
that sends a guy
straight into dad panic.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.998
Everything just snaps
into focus.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.751
I know you think I'm dealing
with my Parkinson's
like a champ,

03:29.834 --> 03:33.880
but trust me, a death sentence
never really leaves
the top of your mind.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.882
All I can think about
is how much time I have left

03:35.965 --> 03:37.967
to leave little Rory something
to remember me by.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.928
I hate to break it to you,

03:40.011 --> 03:43.681
but you don't just get to drop
everything because of some
stupid epiphany.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.433
That's not how this works!

03:47.101 --> 03:51.314
As someone who's been
staring death in the face
for a while,

03:51.397 --> 03:52.774
take my advice.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.068
Figure out what's left
for you to do

03:55.151 --> 03:58.655
and use every second
you have left to do it.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.074
Because this shit
won't stop to wait for you.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.534
[clattering]

04:04.953 --> 04:05.912
You know what?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.580
Fine.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.749
Fuck you, too.

04:13.836 --> 04:14.837
[Larry groans]

04:18.091 --> 04:20.218
- What's wrong
with you, Pop-Pop?
- [screams]

04:25.473 --> 04:26.683
[screams]

04:26.766 --> 04:28.935
Relax. It's just me, Rory.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.562
What the fuck?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.608
- [Rory giggles]
- [laughs nervously]

04:35.692 --> 04:36.859
[country music playing]

04:42.031 --> 04:43.491
I'm a little low on funds
right now,

04:43.574 --> 04:47.245
but I'll get some money
from somebody for gas.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.622
And I'll mail you back
your clothes
once I've washed them.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.376
You can keep the clothes, Vic.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.045
I just... I know this isn't
how you wanted
to spend your Saturday--

04:56.129 --> 04:58.506
I mean, it's fine.

04:58.589 --> 05:02.176
But I gotta ask,
of all the places on Earth
you could have hid out,

05:03.553 --> 05:06.723
why my place?
All the way in Detroit?

05:06.806 --> 05:10.518
Look, man,
it was a weird night,
even for us.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.979
It's not every day
we get hit with a youth spell.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.065
Transmutation magic, huh?

05:19.485 --> 05:21.237
That's some
level-9-sorcery shit.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.322
[chuckles]

05:23.406 --> 05:25.533
Just another day in the life
of a superhero.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.801
Hey, I need to talk to Kay.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.266
Look at my hair!
Things are fucked!

05:50.349 --> 05:52.477
I need to make sure she's safe!

05:52.560 --> 05:53.770
What the fuck are you doing?

05:55.563 --> 05:57.190
Kay gave everybody a puzzle.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.068
So, you're just going
to sit here and fuck off

06:00.151 --> 06:02.987
while the Grim Reaper
slobbers down our neck?

06:03.905 --> 06:04.989
It's what the girl wants.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.532
Yeah, and so did trauma.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.909
[all gasp]

06:09.535 --> 06:11.037
Take it back.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.872
You know, they're not the same.

06:12.955 --> 06:16.042
Well, if Kay thinks
I'm gonna spend
my last days on Earth

06:16.125 --> 06:17.794
doing a fucking puzzle,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.046
she's even crazier than I am.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.172
You know what?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.634
Fuck all this.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.969
You want to roll over
and die without a fight?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.096
Be my guest.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.889
I'm going out with a bang.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.391
Smoke 'em
if you got 'em, fuckwads!

06:45.196 --> 06:48.825
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

06:48.908 --> 06:52.120
God, the disrespect
with these fucking creatures.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.162
[groans]

06:54.330 --> 06:55.498
[neck cracks]

06:57.375 --> 07:00.503
[groans] Did we sleep here
all night?

07:00.586 --> 07:03.881
Well, evidently,
we turned to babies

07:03.965 --> 07:05.508
before the bus came.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.385
So, either we were too small
for the bus driver to see us,

07:07.468 --> 07:10.847
or the human race really
is lacking
in any common decency.

07:10.930 --> 07:16.102
The good news is,
obviously, the spell
was reversed at some point,

07:16.185 --> 07:17.228
Oh.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.604
But is there another
bus coming?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.357
- I'm ready to go home.
- Home?

07:21.440 --> 07:24.443
Well, what about what
we talked about last night?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.154
What about the mission?

07:26.237 --> 07:29.866
I'm afraid that was
just the virility
of youth speaking.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.493
All I want to do now
is just lay down,

07:32.577 --> 07:34.287
maybe make some peanut brittle.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.665
Oh, fuck your peanut brittle.
Here, that is not
the Rita I know.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.960
Get that coffee down you,
and we will get
your longevity back,

07:41.043 --> 07:43.546
and save the universe
in the process.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.839
Now, I have been thinking,

07:44.922 --> 07:46.924
Willoughby said
that all of this is tied

07:47.008 --> 07:49.343
to the Caulder
Immortus Project, right?

07:49.427 --> 07:53.764
Well, I suspect that someone
in the Bureau picked up
where Caulder left off.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.518
They found what he couldn't.

07:57.602 --> 08:01.814
A way to actually conjure
this Immortus,

08:03.232 --> 08:04.901
whatever the fuck it is.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.527
Now, if we're going
to stop this,

08:06.611 --> 08:09.071
we're going to have to go back
to where this all began.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.865
Oh. Now, hold on.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.492
- You want to go to the Bureau?
- Yeah.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.413
[gasps] After everything
that happened to both of us...

08:18.915 --> 08:20.625
You can't be serious.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.879
Our friends are in danger,
Rita, and we are heroes,
are we not?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.510
Ugh! Fine.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.428
Smashing.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.554
Now, how do we get in?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.640
Why are you asking me?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.142
Mmm. 'Cause you're the leader.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.437
I am not in the mood
to be patronized.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.732
- We both know where I stand
with the team.
- Oh, please.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.026
My promotion was simply
what was needed

08:47.109 --> 08:51.280
for one particular task,
and it was a shite task
at that.

08:51.364 --> 08:56.494
Now, you know, if I'm honest,
I would rather
be a supporting role.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.037
Hell of a lot less pressure.

09:00.206 --> 09:04.043
So, what's the plan, boss?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.463
[metal clanking]

09:07.546 --> 09:08.631
[groans]

09:13.302 --> 09:14.804
What the hell is going on?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.598
Where are you taking me?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.393
[thunder rumbling]

09:25.731 --> 09:30.069
Hey, buddy, now'd be
a great time to, I don't know,
blast these guys into oblivion?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.364
Not exactly the energy
I'm looking for.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.365
[groans]

09:45.751 --> 09:47.461
- Release him.
- Rama.

09:49.588 --> 09:50.756
He's my target.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.259
I'll bring him
to The Sacrarium myself.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.802
- [scissors clanking]
- [Larry groans]

10:01.475 --> 10:03.060
[whooshes]

10:05.104 --> 10:06.897
Whoa, whoa!

10:06.981 --> 10:07.982
[exhales] Thank God.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.027
[Rama] Let's get out of here.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.820
We need to cut a portal
back to Earth.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.409
[Larry] Did you just say
"back to Earth"?

10:18.492 --> 10:19.702
Where the hell are we?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.705
A pocket dimension
called Orqwith.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.998
And those are the Scissormen,

10:24.081 --> 10:26.000
its powerful,
but mindless custodians.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.836
This way.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.547
The others sent them
because they felt I was taking
too long, I imagine.

10:31.630 --> 10:35.426
- Taking too long to what?
- To bring you here
and extract your longevity.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.178
That's the only thing
that matters to them.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.721
"Extract my longevity"?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.181
Wait. Is that what happened
to Rita?

10:40.264 --> 10:42.224
What the hell
is going on here, Rama?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.351
[scissors clanking]

10:47.980 --> 10:51.525
You need to tell me
exactly what Immortus is. Now.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.403
Immortus is hope.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.574
Look, each of us
had some desperate wish
we'd all but given up on.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.576
And then Immortus found us.

11:00.659 --> 11:04.872
He showed each of us a vision
of the possibilities
that lie before us.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.291
He called upon us
to usher him onto this plane.

11:07.375 --> 11:12.171
And when he arrives, he will
rewrite history and make
all our wishes come true.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.923
You mean like a genie?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.050
You're describing a genie.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.426
Well, everyone has a wish.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.678
Even you.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.306
Perhaps to never again
be separated from Keeg?

11:27.228 --> 11:30.314
What makes you so sure
Immortus even has
that kind of power?

11:32.149 --> 11:33.651
You know that temple
we just saw?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.363
The entire thing
rose from the Earth

11:37.446 --> 11:40.324
when Dr. Janice deposited
Rita's longevity.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.785
If that's not evidence
of enormous power,
I don't know what is.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.038
I feel like I shouldn't
have to tell you this,
but when a bone temple

11:46.122 --> 11:49.959
spontaneously sprouts
from the ground,
it's not usually a good sign.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.461
We all have to put our faith
in something.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.632
Then why did you just
rescue me?

11:56.715 --> 11:59.969
Because hurting people
wasn't part of the plan.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.221
I'm afraid in their zeal,
the others have forgotten that.

12:04.348 --> 12:09.061
You said, that you would
help me find another way
to stabilize my molecules.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.772
Did you mean it?

12:13.107 --> 12:15.401
Of course.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.696
Nobody has more experience
getting out
of impossible situations

12:18.779 --> 12:20.030
than my friends and I.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.199
After we stop Immortus,
we'll help you.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.200
I promise.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.291
You can put your faith
in me, Rama.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.590
You have my faith,
Larry Trainor.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.513
[portal chiming]

12:50.269 --> 12:52.188
[Rory] What about
what Willoughby said?

12:52.271 --> 12:55.024
Immortus sounded
like real bad news.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.486
He already hurt Rita and Jane.
Who's next?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.362
[Cliff] Will you shut up?

13:00.446 --> 13:04.033
I'm not taking any advice
from a manifestation
of my diseased brain.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.744
And in case you missed it,
I'm doing this for you.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.580
Well, the real you, anyway.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.917
This chariot's
gonna be all yours.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.127
[Rory] You aren't
fooling anybody, Pop-Pop.

13:15.211 --> 13:20.132
If you really cared about me,
you'd be on a bus
to Florida right now.

13:20.216 --> 13:26.180
All you're doing is burying
your fear in something
you think you can control.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.516
You know who else
used to do that?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.601
[Cliff] Listen to me,
Hamburger Helper.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.228
Do not go there.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.604
[Rory] Your daddy, that's who.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.731
[Cliff grunts]
That's completely different.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.900
Unlike him,
I know I'm a bad person.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.237
I also know I don't have
enough time to fix myself.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.906
But I do have enough time
to fix this car.

13:43.989 --> 13:48.494
I'm going to prove to you
that I am capable
of creating more than pain.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.331
I can create something
beautiful, too.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.960
[Rory] Come with me, Pop-Pop.
I wanna show you something.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.757
[Rory] You could've squished
this little guy,
but you didn't.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.636
In fact, you risked
a lot to save him.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.597
Is that something
a bad person would do?

14:09.807 --> 14:11.934
[Cliff] Well, it is
a Zombie Butt.

14:12.017 --> 14:16.188
In hindsight, saving it
was probably not the best idea.
[chuckles]

14:16.272 --> 14:18.190
"Hindsight." Get it? [laughs]

14:18.274 --> 14:23.862
[Rory] The point is,
despite all your mistakes,
you are a good person.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.739
The proof is right here.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.784
[buzzing]

14:35.207 --> 14:36.208
[Cliff] Larry?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.132
[knock at door]

14:43.215 --> 14:45.301
- It's open.
- [shop bell dings]

14:48.971 --> 14:49.888
[door closes]

14:52.975 --> 14:53.809
Hey.

14:55.019 --> 14:55.894
Hey.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.106
Wow.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.278
I honestly didn't know
if I'd ever hear
from you again.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.782
- Love your hair, by the way.
- Oh.

15:08.866 --> 15:14.371
Tell me, what sort of, uh,
mischief have you
been getting up to?

15:15.914 --> 15:16.874
Uh...

15:19.418 --> 15:23.964
- Just, um,
doing a lot of thinking.
- Ah.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.551
I've been doing a lot
of thinking about...

15:29.887 --> 15:30.721
you.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.641
Well...

15:33.724 --> 15:36.685
I've been thinking
about you, too.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.397
And I wanted to give you space
to take the leap.

15:40.481 --> 15:45.235
Then I started worrying
maybe you took that
as a lack of interest.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.113
I decided I have to stop
living for other people.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.535
I have to start
living for myself.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.162
That's a big step
for you, Jane.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.373
Kay must be doing very--

15:57.456 --> 16:00.793
I have to start going after
what I want.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.504
And what do you want?

16:09.051 --> 16:09.885
Jane.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.346
It's okay.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.808
Let's just take our time.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.311
- I'm not going anywhere.
- No.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.064
I want this.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.359
I'm ready.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.277
I've wanted this
for a long time.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.465
Jane. Jane.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.926
[breathes deeply]

16:51.009 --> 16:54.763
Why can't I do this?
What the fuck is wrong with me?

16:54.847 --> 16:58.267
It's okay. I know
how complicated
this is for you.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.686
No, you don't.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.730
You have no idea.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.860
- Nobody does.
- That's simply not true.

17:07.943 --> 17:13.407
But I do think it's time,
maybe, that you got real help.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.659
No. [chuckles]

17:17.202 --> 17:18.412
I don't have time for that.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.253
[Jane exhales] I...

17:27.045 --> 17:27.921
[exhales]

17:30.299 --> 17:33.302
I'm just so tired of fighting.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.972
Why does every single thing
have to be so painful?

17:38.557 --> 17:41.268
Why does everything have to be
such a fucking battle?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.271
I'm so sorry.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.108
You don't deserve
all this pain.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.995
[breathing heavily]

18:00.078 --> 18:00.996
<i>Dios.</i>

18:32.611 --> 18:34.238
I'm not ready to die.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.701
I'm...

18:47.209 --> 18:48.544
What the fuck?

18:48.627 --> 18:53.465
Larry? It is you.
How'd you do that?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.552
- Cliff. Thank God you're--
- What are you doing here?

18:56.635 --> 19:00.472
Please don't tell me
that we're adopting
another super villain.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.723
I'm no villain.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.559
- I'm a man of many--
- Many elements.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.686
- Yeah, I know.
- [Larry] No, you can trust him.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.938
He's a good man.
He's proven that to me.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.775
Are we talking about the same
dude who dropped us into
a fire pit and kidnapped Keeg?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.069
'Cause that dude,
still on my shitlist!

19:14.153 --> 19:17.155
Look, he didn't kidnap...
Look, we have
an understanding now.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.909
I trust him.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.912
Wait. Am I sensing
sexual tension here?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.706
What? No. I mean...

19:25.789 --> 19:28.792
- We haven't crossed
that bridge, but...
- There's a bridge?

19:31.503 --> 19:34.089
I'm here to help you
stop Immortus.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.633
Fuck! No, not this again.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.886
Wait, you're in danger, too.

19:38.969 --> 19:42.764
The agents of Immortus
still need your longevity
and Jane's,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.099
and they'll stop at nothing
to get it.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.351
Oh, they already got Jane's.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.770
[Larry] Wait, that means
we're the last two pieces.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.189
We have to stop this
before it's too late.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.442
Because if Immortus rises,
we'll all... [groans]

19:54.526 --> 19:55.652
Keeg?

19:56.612 --> 19:57.529
- [Cliff] Woah!
- No!

19:58.947 --> 20:00.115
[Cliff yells]

20:02.367 --> 20:03.160
Fuck!

20:03.243 --> 20:05.037
[apparition humming]

20:12.419 --> 20:13.795
The guy got totally catfished.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.048
He lost the asset
to a couple of con artists.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.926
Butthunter,
more like buttloser.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.553
- [elevator dings]
- [both laugh]

20:21.637 --> 20:23.764
Buttloser.
That's fucking gold.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.479
Some grade-A
team work there, Bendy.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.815
[Rita] Looks like we've
still got a little of the old
piffle-paffle after all.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.692
- [chimes]
- [janitor] Bingo.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.115
Still don't know
why I had to be
the craggy, old janitor.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.452
[Rita] Would you prefer to be
the bucket of dirty water?

20:46.954 --> 20:47.913
Point taken.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.500
[dramatic music playing]

21:23.323 --> 21:25.033
- [groans]
- [neck cracks]

21:25.117 --> 21:27.035
Well, that's not getting
any easier.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.124
Well, this place sure wasn't
on my mail route.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.542
Where are we?

21:33.625 --> 21:38.547
Section 99, colloquially
referred to as a vineyard.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.634
Projects so dangerous
or foolhardy,
they died on the vine,

21:42.718 --> 21:45.512
or were unceremoniously
nipped in the bud.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.890
Most of Caulder's initiatives
ended up here.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.560
I suspect the Immortus Project
is no different.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.188
"Imhotep..."

21:56.106 --> 21:58.066
"Immolation Project."

22:01.945 --> 22:03.030
[sighs]

22:03.113 --> 22:07.242
Last checked out
January 13th, 1955.

22:09.327 --> 22:12.497
Checked by asset 34771.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.545
That's, uh... A dead end.
Let's turn back.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.923
What? No.
We are in the middle
of a mission,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.843
and if I may say,
we are crushing it so far.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.636
Oh, we can send someone else.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.097
This mission is best-suited
to Vic, anyway,
or perhaps Jane.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.225
Hey, what's gotten into you?
Talk to me.

22:37.647 --> 22:41.526
It's... Wally,

22:42.277 --> 22:43.111
Rita.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.114
Wally Sage.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.743
Weapon.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.411
<i>- On your knees!</i>
<i>- Malcolm!</i>

22:53.789 --> 22:54.623
Wally?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.168
It all started here with Wally.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.797
Malcolm's death.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.175
You losing your longevity,
Immortus rising.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.137
I put him here.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.308
This is all happening
because of me.

23:13.391 --> 23:16.311
It's not your fault,
you can't control--

23:16.394 --> 23:18.021
How could it not be my fault?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.607
Hmm?

23:20.690 --> 23:25.028
I doomed him
and countless others
to this hell.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.073
And now my past has returned
to exact penance.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.497
How could I think
I ever deserved anything
in life but pain?

23:35.580 --> 23:38.083
No. No.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.127
You're not going
to crack on me now.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.214
We are going to stop this.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.675
If that means confronting
our past, then that's
what we have to do.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.385
Okay. Well, I don't know
if you've noticed,

23:48.468 --> 23:51.513
but I actually hate
confronting my past.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.556
Listen to me.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.391
I'm the leader.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.187
That means you have to do
what I say.

23:59.271 --> 24:03.859
You're going to take us
to Wally's cell,
and that's all there is to it.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.610
Okay?

24:09.030 --> 24:09.948
Okay.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.207
What is this?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.918
Yo, some kind of energy vortex?

24:22.002 --> 24:23.420
[Cliff groaning]

24:23.503 --> 24:24.796
Mmm. Fuck.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.631
Cliff. You all right, man?

24:26.715 --> 24:27.591
What happened?

24:27.674 --> 24:30.427
It took Larry. [groans]

24:30.510 --> 24:32.053
[Derick] Yo, is this a portal?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.890
- Y'all got portals here now?
- That's not one of ours.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.268
Don't get too close.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.979
Look, man, this is the kind
of superhero shit
I was talking about.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.023
[sobs] Why?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.446
[Vic] Looks like some kind
of magic realm.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.074
If Larry's in trouble in there,
I've got to help him.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.117
It's kind of my job.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.079
- Vic, you're not a superhero.
- Go home.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.414
I'll Venmo you that gas money.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.963
Hey, what are you...

25:07.047 --> 25:08.423
Oh, for fuck's sake,

25:08.506 --> 25:10.508
that was our only good knife!

25:11.843 --> 25:12.969
[portal whooshes]

25:16.056 --> 25:18.642
Derick. I told you to go home.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.480
Oh, man! Oh, my...

25:24.689 --> 25:26.733
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

25:26.816 --> 25:28.526
- I told you this was--
- Some superhero shit.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.445
Yeah, I know.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.656
But you left
before I could remind you,
you ain't a superhero anymore.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.576
Matter of fact,
less than 12 hours ago,
I was changing your diapee,

25:36.660 --> 25:38.620
- In case you forgot.
- I didn't forget.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.206
And I'd appreciate it
if you never
brought that up again.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.171
Okay. Just... Just stay close.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.923
Okay?

25:51.925 --> 25:52.842
God.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.890
And don't touch anything.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.661
Oh.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.538
What on Earth?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.468
[Rita] Oh,
this place isn't right.

26:37.595 --> 26:42.600
There's, um...
There's a darkness here.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.269
[whispering] And It smells
really bad.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.146
Okay. You don't
have to do this.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.522
This is my hair shirt.

26:47.605 --> 26:48.648
I can do it alone.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.402
We're a team.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.404
Remember?

26:56.114 --> 26:57.073
Mmm-hmm.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.160
[Rita] Hmm.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.832
Besides, it doesn't look
like he's here.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.715
[Madame Rouge] Well, there's
no doubt this is his work.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.475
Oh, my God.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.228
It's Malcolm.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.938
- [man] I recognize you.
- [Rita gasps]

27:39.991 --> 27:40.950
[Madame Rouge] Wally?

27:46.664 --> 27:50.502
[Derick] Hell. This place
is something else,
to say the least.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.215
So, you're just going
to pout the whole time,

27:55.298 --> 27:56.674
'cause things
didn't go your way?

27:57.675 --> 27:58.927
Same old Vic, huh?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.595
It's not like that.

28:00.678 --> 28:01.679
Then why do I feel
like I'm getting
the silent treatment?

28:01.763 --> 28:03.640
Because I'm scared, man.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.850
You've got a whole family,
and I don't know
if I can protect you in here.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.227
Well, then
who's protecting you?

28:07.310 --> 28:09.687
That's different.
I signed up for this.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.231
Why did you come
to my house last night?

28:11.314 --> 28:13.566
- I told you. It was--
- No. I'll tell you why.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.318
It's because you know
I got you.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.113
No matter what.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.699
You really think that's going
to change just because
you went AWOL for a few years?

28:24.035 --> 28:28.373
- Please, man.
- Derick. Derick.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.333
Derick. Look, man, I'm sorry.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.670
I'm sorry I never tried
to meet you halfway.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.047
I never tried to understand
how things were
for you back home.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.132
No, man.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.133
I'm sorry.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.387
I shouldn't have put
all that blame on you.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.601
I just wish we could go
back in time, you know.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.401
Deep down,
that's the real reason
I came back.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.278
Is that why you got rid
of your tech, too?

29:03.741 --> 29:04.742
We should keep moving.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.583
[Derick] You know, the kids
from my robotics club

29:11.666 --> 29:15.336
flipped when I told them
that me and Cyborg were boys
back in the day.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.921
You know,
that shit's inspiring.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.508
Inspires my kids every day.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.052
Inspires me, too.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.016
I really appreciate you
saying that, D.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.935
The point is,
no matter how far you drift,

29:31.019 --> 29:34.022
you'll always be connected
to where we came from.

29:34.105 --> 29:38.234
At the end of the day,
you'll always be one of us.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.238
Detroiticons for life?

29:49.454 --> 29:50.538
Detroiticons for life.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.832
[both laughing]

30:09.807 --> 30:11.226
[knock at door]

30:13.686 --> 30:15.063
[Jane] Fuck off.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.981
[Cliff] You still want to fuck
those Immortus jerks up?

30:20.944 --> 30:21.903
Can I come in?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.031
Whatever.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.074
[door opens]

30:33.998 --> 30:34.916
[sighs]

30:37.377 --> 30:41.839
I guess I, uh...
I owe you an apology.

30:41.923 --> 30:46.928
I got sucked straight up
my own ass, and I forgot
what matters.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.471
Yeah, and what's that exactly?

30:49.722 --> 30:51.266
You're really gonna
make me say it?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.311
[groans]

30:55.895 --> 30:57.272
[sighs]

30:57.355 --> 31:00.275
What matters is being there
for the people I love.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.528
There, I said it. Happy?

31:04.988 --> 31:06.823
I don't know
if I deserve to be loved.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.968
[tape rips]

31:41.983 --> 31:48.615
I hate to break it to you,
but if people want to love you,

31:48.698 --> 31:52.577
there isn't really anything
you can do to stop them.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.764
So, you want to go fuck
these Immortus chumps up,
or what?

32:14.974 --> 32:17.518
You bet your copper-plated ass.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.812
[man thuds, yells, groans]

32:24.734 --> 32:27.737
Jesus. What the hell happened
to you?

32:29.989 --> 32:30.948
They found us.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.409
They got Bunbury.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.453
Oh. You mean the bunny
who stole my longevity?

32:35.536 --> 32:37.330
He was on our side.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.916
He was one
of the Knights Templar.

32:39.999 --> 32:46.005
We were trying
to protect your longevity
from the agents of Immortus.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.465
We didn't stand a chance.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.677
I've never seen such power.

32:52.553 --> 32:55.556
Cliff, we have to get you
to safety.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.309
If they get your longevity,
that's it.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.644
It's all over.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.479
And why the fuck
would we ever trust you again?

33:01.562 --> 33:04.524
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you the one
that reversed the youth spell?

33:04.607 --> 33:10.238
No. So, look.
These fuckers get stronger

33:10.321 --> 33:14.742
with every ounce of longevity
they get from you twats.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.787
They made
the most powerful wizards
in the known universe

33:17.870 --> 33:19.247
look like a bunch

33:19.330 --> 33:22.083
of prepubescent pixies.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.753
This is all that's left
of the little pebble-dropper.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.298
All right. Well,
how do we stop them?

33:29.382 --> 33:32.260
[angrily] You're not
paying attention.

33:32.343 --> 33:36.431
This isn't some threat
you can just punch
into submission.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.015
Yeah, well,
everything you're saying

33:38.099 --> 33:40.601
just makes me want
to kick their asses even more.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.980
- Cliff?
- Right on, sister.

33:51.779 --> 33:55.908
Godspeed,
you irascible fuckwits.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.626
Is that the end?
Yo, we made it.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.420
[scissors clanking]

34:11.215 --> 34:12.925
[Derick] Yo, who the hell
are those guys?

34:13.009 --> 34:14.385
[Vic] No idea.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.804
We've got to get past them
if we want to get inside.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.599
Inside?

34:19.682 --> 34:21.976
You want to go inside
Castle Grayskull?

34:22.059 --> 34:23.811
Yo, Larry's got to be in there.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.067
We got to figure out
a way to take them out.

34:34.280 --> 34:40.787
Weird. Look, this flower's
made of newsprint,
like, actual newsprint.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.997
There's no way it could have
evolved like this.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.334
You remember
when we used to play D&D
at Calvin's?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.211
- Pettiest dungeon master ever?
- Exactly.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.630
But eventually we realized
that to complete our mission,

34:50.713 --> 34:53.466
we had to play Calvin
against himself.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.343
- We gamed the system.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.930
Everything in
a D&D campaign exists
because the DM put it there.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.473
Everything has a purpose.

35:06.938 --> 35:12.193
Eureka! What if
this whole place
was created by somebody?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.694
I mean, there's got
to be a reason

35:13.778 --> 35:15.363
they have pen
and paper everywhere.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.907
And you said
this place was magic, right?

35:18.783 --> 35:19.617
Yeah.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.553
Holy shit.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.596
I think I know
how we can get past
those scissor guys.

35:43.182 --> 35:44.433
But I'm gonna need your help.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.188
Oh. Almost...
Almost got it.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.399
Honestly, can't we just
question him through the door?

35:51.482 --> 35:54.026
Uh, we're getting him
out of here, Rita.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.487
What? This is not
a rescue mission.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.573
Well, I can't
just leave him behind.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.157
He's suffered enough.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.076
He's suffered?

36:02.159 --> 36:03.077
- Yeah.
- Oh.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.956
Just tell us
what we need to know.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.125
Where is Orqwith?

36:09.208 --> 36:12.795
What is Orqwith?
Is that where Immortus rises?

36:13.838 --> 36:16.132
[sighs] Answer me!

36:16.215 --> 36:18.634
[Wally] It's where
all ideas are born...

36:20.011 --> 36:21.721
and all the bad ideas die.

36:23.973 --> 36:29.562
Is Immortus there?
How do we stop this, Wally?

36:29.645 --> 36:31.105
- [indistinct chatter]
- Oh.

36:31.188 --> 36:32.481
[whispering] We have to go.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.567
No, I can't leave him.
I'm not leaving him.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.027
You cannot make this right.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.571
- WelI, I have to try!
- [Wally] It's too late.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.032
Immortus rises.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.033
[door unlocks]

36:53.294 --> 36:54.170
Come on, Wally.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.339
[Wally] So much pain.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.343
It will all be over soon.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.637
We didn't come here
to hurt you, Wally.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.680
Please, come.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.022
[gasps]

37:14.565 --> 37:15.816
You already hurt me.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.486
[breath trembling]

37:18.569 --> 37:19.445
[gasping] No.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.156
[flesh squelching]

37:22.239 --> 37:24.116
- Rita.
- Every new beginning...

37:25.076 --> 37:26.452
must start with an ending.

37:27.453 --> 37:30.414
[groaning]

37:32.041 --> 37:34.251
- [bird caws]
- [Wally screams]

37:36.921 --> 37:38.839
[screams]

37:42.385 --> 37:43.552
[groans]

37:46.347 --> 37:48.516
[Larry] What the hell?

37:48.599 --> 37:50.643
Why the hell
did you bring me back here?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.229
Keeg, answer me!

37:54.939 --> 37:56.190
Don't let them do this.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.900
They'll take my longevity.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.319
Then what? [groans]

38:00.403 --> 38:01.320
Okay.

38:02.154 --> 38:04.615
[humming in unison]

38:12.415 --> 38:14.041
Keeg, please.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.292
Why won't you stop them?

38:16.419 --> 38:18.045
[groans, sighs]

38:19.964 --> 38:21.215
Keeg?

38:21.298 --> 38:23.592
Oh, thank God.
Wait. What are you...

38:24.385 --> 38:26.929
[Larry groaning]

38:28.431 --> 38:31.308
No! No! Keeg.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.601
Help me!

38:32.685 --> 38:34.103
Help me, Keeg!

38:39.108 --> 38:40.276
I'm sorry.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.236
My radiation is leaking.

38:42.319 --> 38:43.529
I don't know what to do.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.700
But I guess you do.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.497
Oh, God.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.630
That's what future Keeg
showed you, isn't it?

39:01.714 --> 39:04.550
You think you have
to destroy me
to save the world,

39:04.633 --> 39:06.552
but you don't have to worry
about that.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.930
We stopped The Buttpocalypse,
and we'll stop
whatever comes next.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.307
Just like we stopped The Brain,

39:11.390 --> 39:13.726
and the Decreator, Mr. Nobody.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.355
It never ends, does it?

39:18.856 --> 39:20.357
You're afraid it's inevitable.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.697
You think Immortus
can keep us together forever.

39:28.365 --> 39:30.076
You really believe that,
don't you?

39:32.578 --> 39:34.497
[groaning]

39:36.540 --> 39:40.419
Okay, [breathing heavily]
they can have my longevity.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.006
[groaning] I trust you, Keeg.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.509
I trust you.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.652
Ooh. Now, that's badass.

40:04.735 --> 40:07.279
Yeah, I'm thinking
of the shoulder-mounted laser
turret to round it off.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.155
Uh-huh.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.281
[rumbling]

40:12.576 --> 40:13.786
I think that's our cue.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.745
Let's do this.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.626
[Derick] Yup.

40:23.838 --> 40:24.964
[Vic exhales]

40:28.342 --> 40:29.510
[whooshing]

40:29.593 --> 40:30.803
It's working.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.442
Yes! Yes!

40:55.286 --> 40:56.745
Booyah.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.417
[metal clanking]

41:03.460 --> 41:05.337
[robot] Mr. Invincible online.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.591
All systems go.
Awaiting orders.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.800
You do the honors, man.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.391
Go take out those scissor guys.

41:17.474 --> 41:19.018
[robot] Mission accepted.

41:20.644 --> 41:23.647
[Vic] I used to dream
of Mr. Invincible
coming to life.

41:26.025 --> 41:26.942
We did that.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.072
[Rita sighs]

41:33.824 --> 41:37.786
- Rita.
- What happened?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.581
What did I do? What...

41:40.664 --> 41:42.208
Where... Where is he?

41:45.544 --> 41:46.545
Oh.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.218
Oh. [whimpers]

41:56.138 --> 41:59.433
- What happened to Wally?
- I'm afraid you...

42:01.310 --> 42:04.271
- I smushed him?
- We don't know that
for sure. Um...

42:04.355 --> 42:07.316
You know, he could have
escaped, somehow.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.193
No. I...

42:09.276 --> 42:10.110
I killed him.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.487
I know it.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.447
[voice alarm system]
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

42:13.530 --> 42:15.616
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

42:15.699 --> 42:16.867
- Rita.
- Mmm.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.911
We have got to get out of here.

42:18.994 --> 42:20.454
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

42:32.383 --> 42:34.301
[Mr. Invincible]
Put down your weapons.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.345
You have five seconds
to comply.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.597
[Cliff] Hey, I always wanted
to say that!

42:39.890 --> 42:41.684
[Jane] Will you focus?

42:41.767 --> 42:43.352
- [Mr. Invincible] Five...
- [Jane] What's with
the mini keg, anyway?

42:43.435 --> 42:45.229
[Cliff] I'm not taking
any chances this time.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.857
- [Mr. Invincible] Four...
- My special hand
is meant for loving only.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.317
- [Mr. Invincible] Three...
- Ew.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.986
[Cliff] Which one's
on our side?

42:52.069 --> 42:53.612
- [Jane] My money's on the bot.
- [Mr. Invincible] Two...

42:53.696 --> 42:56.490
He's outnumbered, and he has
a huge stick up his ass.

42:56.573 --> 42:58.033
Sounds like a kindred spirit.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.451
- [Mr. Invincible] One.
- [Cliff] Good enough for me.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.870
[Mr. Invincible powering up,
explodes]

43:01.954 --> 43:03.122
[whooshes]

43:04.415 --> 43:05.499
[Cliff] Um...

43:05.582 --> 43:06.834
- What...
- What the shit?

43:06.917 --> 43:07.960
[scissors clanking]

43:08.043 --> 43:09.878

43:17.928 --> 43:19.722
Look alive, Cliffasaurus.

43:19.805 --> 43:22.558
[Cliff] Uh, I think it's worth
noting that whatever God
of this place

43:22.641 --> 43:26.687
that just killed that robot
can definitely kill this robot.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.856
[Jane] Who are these choads?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.692
Hey, you guys look steamy.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.819
Are we interrupting
a bath time?

43:33.902 --> 43:34.945
[Cliff laughs]

43:35.029 --> 43:37.364
Yeah. Cool bathrobes.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.283
Got any in XXL?

- [scissors clanking]
- [Cliff] Whoops!
Didn't see that coming.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.897
We got this.

44:09.980 --> 44:13.192
These guys are nothing
but a bunch
of Tim Burton rejects.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.903
Not like a horde
of rabid Zombie Butts.

44:15.986 --> 44:18.906
- [Rory] Hey, Pop-Pop.
- Let's just stay cool,
little buddy.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.324
Now is not a good time.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.454
[Rory] Pop-Pop.

44:25.537 --> 44:28.499
- [Cliff yelling] What?
- Did you remember to close
the freezer all the way?

44:28.582 --> 44:29.583
[Cliff] What?

44:29.666 --> 44:31.210
Who the hell are
you talking to?

44:32.711 --> 44:34.213
[Cliff] Oh, fuck.
