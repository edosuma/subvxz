WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:07.716
Okay. New expansion.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.177
First job for the new partners.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.345
Clean slate. Fresh start.

00:11.428 --> 00:15.516
Goodbye Raven's Banquet.
Hello... something else.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.687
-Okay, I was think--
-I think--

00:20.771 --> 00:22.189
-We both have ideas.
-Yeah.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.941
That's good. Co-creative directors.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.651
-Yes, equals now.
-Why don't you go first?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
-Really? Okay.
-Yeah.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.906
So I was thinking that
the new expansion could be set at sea.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.992
I was thinking land.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.130
Well, we're not gonna figure this out
today, so I'm gonna take off.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.465
Wait, you're leaving?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.301
Yeah, you know what? I might actually
go out to the desert for a little bit.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.221
You know, sorta clear my mind,
reconnect with my physical form.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.558
I don't know anyone that is more connected
with their physical form than you.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.768
-Thank you.
-That wasn't a compliment.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.770
All right. I'll see you next week.

01:01.854 --> 01:05.147
Next-- No, you can't leave for a week.
We only just started.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.985
Don't worry. I'll just tell David
to shut down the office while I'm gone.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.989
No. You don't need to
shut the office down. I'm here.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.992
I'm gonna noodle on the new expansion.
I don't need you.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.245
Okay. You don't need me. Fine.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.747
Just a little bit of advice though, Pop.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.251
You're not gonna get this done today.
Just relax a little bit.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.628
Go out, get drunk.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.088
Maybe get laid.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.424
It could clear your head.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.217
See ya.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.389
Get laid.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.868
That was nice.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.662
How was it for you?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.124
I gotta say, Pop.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.918
It was pretty terrible.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.466
So...

02:55.968 --> 02:58.053
Everlight was pretty great, huh?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.305
Yeah.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.516
Hey, so...

03:04.142 --> 03:05.686
I was thinking.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.230
-Maybe we should--
-What up, ladies?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.398
You busy?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.943
-Yeah, actually, we were right--
-Cool, I was thinking that we could hang.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.112
Like, have a little girl chat.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.574
Put the controllers down.

03:25.998 --> 03:29.209
I was thinking that we could talk
about, like, what's on our minds,

03:29.293 --> 03:30.919
what's going on in the world.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.672
To be honest, I've actually been feeling--

03:33.755 --> 03:35.257
I was thinking I talk and you listen.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.760
Not that I don't care about the thing
that you were gonna say, but...

03:38.844 --> 03:39.845
I don't.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.889
It's just...
I need to get something off my chest,

03:41.972 --> 03:44.433
and I can talk to you guys,
because no one pays attention to you.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.101
Also, if you said anything,
you would be fired.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.186
What?

03:47.269 --> 03:49.354
Does your girl talk
always involve veiled threats?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.857
Sorry. Was that veiled?
I meant for that to be clear.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.902
If you say anything about this,
you will be fired.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.739
Anyway, I've been having this...

03:59.531 --> 04:01.742
work-related... dream.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.953
Well, no, it's more of a nightmare.
It's kind of been messing with my head.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.247
You had a sex dream about Ian, didn't you?

04:07.331 --> 04:08.874
What? No!

04:09.875 --> 04:12.294
No! No, no. Shut up! No.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.797
-What if I did, though?
-It's not a big deal.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.048
I've had the same dream.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.175
What? No!

04:19.134 --> 04:20.928
I mean, you have?

04:21.678 --> 04:24.556
Yeah. It's pretty common
to have dreams about your boss.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.851
It's not sexual. It's really about power.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.230
But Ian's not my boss anymore.
We're equals.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.899
Not according to your subconscious.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.819
See, the dream is just a representation
of our need for his approval.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.030
Right.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.782
So that's why afterwards
he says it was bad.

04:41.865 --> 04:45.077
He didn't tell me it was bad.
He liked it in my dream.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.247
-I thought it wasn't sexual.
-It isn't.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.873
Then why do you care if he likes it?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.084
I was just saying that
I was better at it than Poppy.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.294
I can hear you. And, no, you weren't.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.757
I am super good at sex, okay?
I'm, like, so good at sex.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.552
Okay.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.554
Whatever.
Just tell me how to make it stop.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.140
Well, if it's really about power,

05:07.224 --> 05:11.520
then maybe you need
to assert your authority in real life.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.689
And then maybe your subconscious
will catch up.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.315
Yeah.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.110
No, I like that. Assert my authority.
That's what I'm gonna do.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.863
That's what I'm gonna do. Girl chat over.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.410
That was weird, huh?

05:27.369 --> 05:28.495
Yeah.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.831
Super weird.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.375
-Did you wanna talk?
-Nope.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.044
No. I'm good.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.721
Hi, Carol. I need to talk to you.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.890
No. It's a new dawn, remember?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.434
-Please, it's not what you think.
-This isn't about Dana?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.979
Okay, I guess it is what you think.
But my issue is...

05:55.814 --> 05:57.482
Okay, so...

05:57.566 --> 05:59.902
I thought that Dana and I
were so close to the next step.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.362
Now it turns out
she might not even be gay.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.989
Which is fine. She doesn't have to be gay.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
She could be bi or "Q," I guess.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.285
To be honest, I never figured out
if "Q" meant queer or questioning.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.038
I mean, she's definitely cis.
Not that that matters.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.749
Unless she's not cis.
Oh, my God, Carol. What if she's not cis,

06:13.832 --> 06:15.459
and I've just been assuming
this whole time she's cis?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.461
Okay. Dear God, you are spinning.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.296
You're right. I'm sorry.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.840
I just-- I don't wanna say the wrong thing
and offend her.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.467
This stuff
is really important to talk about.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.718
I do talk about it...

06:24.801 --> 06:27.012
in the seminars I hold
on workplace discrimination

06:27.095 --> 06:28.263
that no one attends.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.389
Including you.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.226
Yeah, I had a thing that day.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.937
Right. Let's jump into it one-on-one

06:35.020 --> 06:38.232
because you're entitled to
everything you want whenever you want it.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.485
I'm kinda sensing
some microaggression, Carol.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.695
You're sensing macroaggression.

06:44.363 --> 06:47.950
Look, the problem is you're talking to me
when you should be talking to her.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.620
You're so busy not wanting to offend her
that you're not telling her the truth.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.414
Oh, my God, you're right.
I just need to be direct.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.960
I need to go on the forums and educate
myself on the whole "Q" thing and then...

06:58.043 --> 06:59.294
she and I can talk it out.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.714
Thank you, Carol.
I feel really seen and heard.

07:02.798 --> 07:06.760
That's the problem, 'cause
I don't wanna see you or hear you.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.979
Guess who Ian just screwed.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.022
Hey.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.732
No!

07:20.816 --> 07:22.609
I mean... who?

07:22.693 --> 07:23.777
Me.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.988
I just found this stuck
to my office window when I got to work.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.239
"Tempe"?

07:27.322 --> 07:31.368
Yeah. Tempe, Arizona. It's where
Ian does his little annual sabbatical.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.995
Please, it's not a sabbatical.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.290
It's a sleepaway camp for 40-year-old men
who wanna learn how to do MMA.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.083
-It's pathetic.
-It's so pathetic.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.376
-Did you know about this?
-Sort of.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.794
He asked me to take care of his rings,

07:40.878 --> 07:43.297
because they're priceless,
and he got them in the Amazon.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.215
Oh, my--
What is his deal with those rings?

07:45.299 --> 07:47.009
I think he thinks
that it makes him look younger.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.595
You know he cut his beard
because it was getting too gray?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.180
-Do you know he takes hair pills?
-But he calls them...

07:51.263 --> 07:52.306
Vitamins.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.099
What doctor prescribes vitamins?
It's pathetic.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.517
So pathetic.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.728
What am I gonna do now?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.396
Ian and I
were supposed to talk to Montreal

07:59.479 --> 08:01.857
and update them about the new expansion.
He just up and left.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.651
Well, you know Ian. He does what he wants.
He's the boss.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.070
Not mine though. We're equals now.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.158
Yeah. To be clear, I'm the boss.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.327
He works for me, and so do you.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.998
But you're right.
You're not under Ian anymore.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.375
Yo.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.919
What?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.463
In your new position.
It's your time to be on top.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.300
Stretch your legs,
grind it out like a boss.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.760
Yes, you can help me.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.678
And if Ian doesn't like it, fuck him.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.597
I won't! I don't--

08:34.681 --> 08:37.601
What do you need, David? I'm very busy.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.770
Just the title for the new expansion.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.813
Right. We don't have one.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.483
Ian and I have
fundamentally different ideas

08:44.566 --> 08:46.276
of what the new expansion should be.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.486
See, I wanna--

08:47.569 --> 08:50.197
Poppy! Don't care.
Yeah, I just need a title.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.242
If we don't come up with a good one,
Montreal's gonna stick us with a bad one.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.661
So I need a good one, and I need it now.

08:55.744 --> 08:58.580
Okay, yeah.
I can do that. I don't need Ian.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.667
I have the authority, and I will assert--

09:01.750 --> 09:03.252
-Title?
-Right. Yes, no, okay.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.088
So the title of the new expansion...

09:08.215 --> 09:12.052
-The title will be...
-Yeah?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.805
Mythic Quest...

09:16.890 --> 09:18.809
Sea of Ashes.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.897
Great. All right,
I'll have the art team mock something up.

09:23.981 --> 09:27.150
And I just gotta figure out a way
to hold off Montreal till tomorrow.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.194
Can't you just sic Jo on them?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.071
Yeah.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.324
Unfortunately, Jo and I parted ways.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.451
She finally left you, huh?

09:36.535 --> 09:40.706
What? No, she didn't leave me.
No, it was mutual.

09:40.789 --> 09:44.918
She just left to explore
other opportunities in the company.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.964
Jo, I'm glad you left David for me.
That was a dead-end relationship.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.841
-He's such a pussy.
-That goes without saying.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.925
You probably shouldn't say it,

09:52.009 --> 09:54.136
not because it's inappropriate,
but because it's obvious.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.262
I have so much to learn.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.514
That's good,
'cause I have so much to teach.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.808
Lesson one, no notes.
Never leave a paper trail.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.019
Now--

10:02.102 --> 10:04.771
Eventually you'll learn enough to grow
from my protégée

10:04.855 --> 10:06.523
into my sworn enemy.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.193
If I have trained you properly,
you will try to devour me.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.613
But if I devour you during
your attempts to devour me,

10:12.696 --> 10:13.906
that'll only make me stronger.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.616
I'm already thinking
about ways to devour you.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.743
I know you are. That's why I like you.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.178
Hey, Pop.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.389
That may actually have been worse.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.771
Agreed. Totally uninspired.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.652
Goddamn it.

10:56.615 --> 11:00.702
The tension was thick.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.871
You could hear a pin drop.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.415
And then Poppy turns to me,
and she looks me right in the eye,

11:05.499 --> 11:06.750
and she says to me--

11:06.834 --> 11:09.211
Poppy says-- She says...

11:10.504 --> 11:11.922
"Whatever you need, David."

11:12.005 --> 11:14.174
Wow. Wow!

11:14.258 --> 11:17.219
-She said that? She called you "David"?
-Yeah. Well...

11:17.302 --> 11:19.471
Yeah. I mean, that's my name.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.473
Anyway, so I say,

11:21.557 --> 11:25.769
"Look, I need that title now, Pops.
No ifs, ands or buts."

11:25.853 --> 11:28.647
And thus was born Sea of Ashes.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.316
Like the dust of Christ.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.735
Yeah-- No.
There's no religious connotations.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.696
Are you sure? There's a cross right there.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.447
That's a sword. That's always been there.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.491
Okay. Either way, good for you,

11:39.575 --> 11:42.452
because it takes a lot of gumption
to talk that way to your boss.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.246
Yeah. Well...

11:44.329 --> 11:45.372
No, I'm Poppy's boss.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.041
When did that happen? Congratulations.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.293
Always been.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.546
I guess I forget sometimes
just 'cause you have such kind eyes.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.757
Oh, well. Thank you.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.051
I gotta say, Sue, you get a--

11:58.135 --> 12:01.263
You get a very different
David Brittlesbee than they get upstairs.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.016
Let's just say that.
The David they know, he's--

12:04.099 --> 12:06.393
He's firm, but he's fair.
He's an authoritarian.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.520
David, there you are!
I need to talk to you. Got a sec?

12:08.604 --> 12:12.649
Well, sure, yeah. Always got
time to talk to my subordinates.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.904
Actually, I was just showing
Sue here the artwork to Sea of Ashes.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.072
-Trash it. It's not the title.
-Yeah, I thought they did--

12:19.156 --> 12:20.157
Sorry, wait, what?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.285
Nah, it doesn't work.
It's totally... uninspired.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.537
No. You came up with it. It works.

12:25.621 --> 12:28.957
It doesn't! It doesn't!
If it did, it would. But it didn't.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.210
I just need more time
to assert my dominance.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.712
I don't know what is going on with you
and that,

12:33.795 --> 12:36.173
but I don't have any more time, Poppy.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.800
-Okay? I have to tell Montreal the title.
-Just tell them that it's TBD.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.094
-TBD. I like that.
-That's not a title!

12:41.178 --> 12:42.471
Look, you know what? No.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.848
Sea of Ashes is the title,
and that is final.

12:44.932 --> 12:45.933
It's not. It's not good enough.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.809
Then come up with one
that's good enough. Now!

12:47.893 --> 12:48.977
I will.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.397
What are you doing?

12:53.357 --> 12:55.442
Don't tell me what to do!
You're not the boss of me!

12:55.526 --> 12:57.861
I am the boss of you!
I am all of your bosses!

12:58.403 --> 12:59.696
Why does no one understand that?

13:00.197 --> 13:02.115
It's the eyes, David.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.421
Come on, do this, big boy. Yeah! Come on.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.845
Poppy.

13:23.804 --> 13:24.805
Poppy!

13:25.222 --> 13:26.348
Goddamn it.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.559
Hey.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.643
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.064
How have you been?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.733
Awesome. Yeah, super awesome.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.318
-Great.
-Good.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.070
Yeah, same for me.
I'm with Brad now.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.614
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.199
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Hey, man.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.244
-For the record, she came to me.
-No, man. It's all good.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.620
-All good.
-Yeah, it's all good.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.998
Don't worry, David.
I'm sure you'll find someone soon.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.458
Yeah, I'm not even looking, really.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.171
Yeah, I've just been super busy.
Cycling a lot, obviously.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.339
And nose to the grindstone.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.883
Working on the new expansion.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.678
Boom. We just came up with this.
What do you think?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.431
-Yeah, that's...
-Yeah.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.933
It's...

14:10.475 --> 14:12.060
-It's fun!
-Good.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.396
So, you don't like it.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.106
I mean, you could do better.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.399
-Could he?
-I don't...

14:17.482 --> 14:18.859
It's not the final title.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.320
I mean, there's still wiggle room.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.280
We're working it out. It's a process.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.282
-Yeah. Right.
-That's good.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.075
Yeah. Cool.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.535
Pussy.

14:28.619 --> 14:29.620
-Jo.
-Sorry.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.288
Hey.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.332
-That is not a way to talk to your boss.
-It's not.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.917
-Also, he knows already.
-Right. Right.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.753
Okay.
I get what's going on. No, it's cool.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.505
You guys are in the honeymoon phase.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.716
I'm the bad guy. I'm the joke.
I'm the wimp. I'm the "P."

14:43.217 --> 14:44.635
-Yeah. Just--
-Yeah.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.763
I'm not a "P," okay?

14:47.846 --> 14:49.097
I am a boss, all right?

14:49.181 --> 14:51.391
Just to be clear, I'm your boss.
And yours.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.645
Okay? I don't need you guys.
I don't need either of you.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.064
Or Poppy. Or Ian, for that matter.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.732
I'm gonna come up with my own title,

14:58.815 --> 15:01.652
very cool title, all by myself,
even if I have to stay up all night.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.446
Gonna handle my business like a boss,
in the boss's office.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.989
Or Ian's office, obviously.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.867
I'm his boss, so... Back to work!

15:12.788 --> 15:16.375
And get me a coffee, please. Decaf.
Non-dairy milk.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.879
Please.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.215
Whatever.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.218
What did you ever see in him?

15:26.301 --> 15:27.594
I was young.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.350
Hey, Carol.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.601
Jesus.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.562
You two are like little pixie snipers.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.813
-What?
-Nothing.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.107
Let me guess.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.567
-You wanna talk about Rachel.
-Rachel.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.777
She's been avoiding me for a few days.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.363
And then, she sent me an invitation to

15:46.446 --> 15:50.826
"an open forum of shared feelings
in a nonjudgmental safe space."

15:50.909 --> 15:53.161
-What does that mean?
-No idea, but it's in my calendar.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.831
Is it illegal
to have a workplace relationship?

15:55.914 --> 15:58.792
No, it isn't. There's nothing illegal
about dating someone from work.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.211
It's stupid, and it can only end badly,

16:01.295 --> 16:05.132
but it is actually not an HR issue. So...

16:05.215 --> 16:07.968
Great. That is great, because--

16:08.051 --> 16:10.637
Okay, so,
Poppy had this sex dream about Ian, right?

16:10.721 --> 16:12.014
And I had one too.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.516
Rachel got all weird because
in my dream, I totally got him off.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.351
-And Poppy couldn't and--
-Okay.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.812
This is an HR issue,

16:18.896 --> 16:20.898
because y'all
should not be coming into work

16:20.981 --> 16:22.774
telling each other about sex dreams.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.943
-But you just said--
-I'ma cut to the chase.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.528
Do you like this woman?

16:27.070 --> 16:29.406
You mean "like" like her?

16:30.073 --> 16:32.993
Okay. This generation is a hot mess.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.996
You can't have a conversation,
and you're devolving into third graders.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.706
I'm sorry. It's just--

16:37.789 --> 16:40.334
Rachel really loves to talk things out.
Like, a lot.

16:40.417 --> 16:45.422
And she wants to break everything down
and analyze everything. And I don't.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.176
I guess I'm not great with confrontation.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.930
You crept up on me quiet as the night
and pounced like a damn jungle cat.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.474
-I call that confrontation.
-I'm sorry.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.352
You know what you should do?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.687
You should speak to one another.

17:01.146 --> 17:05.233
Be clear. Okay? No more Q's, just A's.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.278
Even if the A's are, "We're still Q'ing."

17:08.362 --> 17:11.823
At least you're talking to each other
and not to me.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.117
You're right.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.454
I just gotta be direct. Thanks, Carol.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.752
God, I miss remote working.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.296
Okay, I think I got it.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.383
Yeah, I got it. Here we go.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.301
And the title is...

17:34.429 --> 17:35.681
Fuck.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.975
Sea of Nazis doesn't even make sense!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.351
What are you doing?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.520
Hey.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.146
I was--

17:43.730 --> 17:45.065
You're back from camp.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.358
It's not camp.

17:46.441 --> 17:50.362
It's a guided retreat where
we harness the power of the male body

17:50.445 --> 17:52.865
through the discipline
of Brazilian jujitsu.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.117
-Okay.
-Why are you in my office?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.953
I was trying to come up
with a title for the new expansion.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.830
Poppy was supposed to do it, but--

17:59.913 --> 18:00.956
You know women.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.624
They get real emotional.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.043
Yeah, David, you seem emotional.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.212
Yeah. I am kinda having a hard time.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.591
It's just been a long night. I've been
trying to come up with this title.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.468
My mom's right, you know?
I'm not a creative. I'm a numbers guy.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.554
Hey, relax, relax, buddy. Relax.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.139
Look, if I learned anything this week,

18:17.222 --> 18:19.474
it's that true power
does not come from without.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.601
It comes from within.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.395
Look, David,
don't be held back by reality.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.231
My reality is different than your reality.

18:26.315 --> 18:28.066
You realize
that I'm actually seven feet tall?

18:30.110 --> 18:32.279
What do they teach you at this thing?

18:32.362 --> 18:34.114
Okay, what are you doing? 'Cause you--

18:34.198 --> 18:36.158
You've come back from this thing
real aggressive.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.242
Yeah.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.954
Now, listen. Tell me how you feel.

18:43.582 --> 18:44.583
Safe.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.294
That's right. Old Ian's got ya.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.795
And, David,

18:48.879 --> 18:51.423
you have all the answers you need
deep inside you.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.134
Would you like me to help you find them?

18:54.218 --> 18:56.220
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:56.303 --> 18:59.264
The name of the expansion is...

18:59.348 --> 19:01.099
Oh, yeah.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.477
Yeah, that's it. Now, you go ahead and...

19:03.560 --> 19:05.687
-What are we doing?
-Yeah.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.856
Now, that's good stuff.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.030
Oh, no.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.926
-David.
-Hey. What's going on?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.928
Why are you sleeping in my office?

19:38.887 --> 19:41.098
I was trying to channel Ian's mindset

19:41.181 --> 19:42.808
to come up with a title
for the new expansion,

19:42.891 --> 19:44.852
-but I couldn't come up with one.
-I thought of it.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.770
You did?

19:46.854 --> 19:47.980
What is it?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.817
"Titans' Rift." That's good. I like that.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.152
I can see the artwork already, you know?

19:54.236 --> 19:56.613
It's like two titans locked in a battle.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.491
One struggling to dominate the other.
One won't submit though.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.952
-Something like that. I don't know.
-Yeah. That's great.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.496
Hey, how did you
come up with it, by the way?

20:05.247 --> 20:06.623
It came to me in a dream.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.917
Oh, yeah? That's cool. What kind of dream?

20:09.001 --> 20:10.085
Just a dream.

20:10.502 --> 20:13.088
You probably wouldn't understand
because you're not creative,

20:13.172 --> 20:15.174
but we creatives,
we have dreams like this sometimes.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.675
You had the Ian sex dream, didn't ya?

20:16.758 --> 20:19.136
No! No.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.762
No. No.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.682
No.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.186
Yeah. Yeah.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.897
Yeah, well, you know. I've had
the dream too. We all have.

20:29.980 --> 20:33.233
It's not uncommon
to have sex dreams about your boss.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.526
It's like a power thing.

20:34.610 --> 20:36.361
But, David, you're his boss.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.324
Right.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.243
Gonna have to unpack that one.

20:43.327 --> 20:46.622
And besides, I wasn't even having
sex with him in the dream. You were.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.165
-Me?
-Yeah.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.626
Ian whispered the title in your ear
while you were...

20:52.044 --> 20:53.170
What?

20:55.005 --> 20:57.341
Sorry. Is that... supposed to be sex?

20:58.050 --> 20:59.051
Yeah.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.969
-Shut up. I'm good at it.
-Okay.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.097
Anyway, the point is, you told me
to come up with the title, and I did.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.807
Yes, you did. I mean, Ian did.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.601
No, it--

21:07.684 --> 21:08.810
It was in my head.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.896
So, yes, Ian came up with it,

21:10.979 --> 21:12.773
but it was in my dream.

21:12.856 --> 21:16.276
Therefore, it was my dream,
I came up with it.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.112
Yeah, but you still needed him.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.572
And so did I.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.580
We probably
shouldn't be talking about this.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.624
-No, no one needs to know. Right?
-Especially not Ian.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.251
-No, definitely not Ian. We did it!
-We did it!

21:32.334 --> 21:33.460
Yeah.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.545
-Hey, Pop.
-Yeah?

21:34.628 --> 21:35.921
-Did I satisfy him?
-David.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.840
I was just wondering if he... you know.

21:50.936 --> 21:51.937
Hey.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.606
Hey.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.442
Okay, here it goes.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.069
Okay, here it goes.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.032
Thanks for meeting me here.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.826
I know it's kinda weird
to meet in a garage,

22:05.909 --> 22:07.494
but I just wanted a neutral space,

22:07.578 --> 22:11.290
and I brought this literature to help us
frame the conversation in a safe and---

22:20.465 --> 22:22.134
Sorry.

22:22.217 --> 22:25.804
But if I didn't do that now,
I don't know if I would be able to later.

22:28.974 --> 22:29.975
You okay?

22:30.809 --> 22:35.606
Yeah. Just... making sure
this isn't a dream.

22:47.826 --> 22:51.038
The first one was cute, but
I ain't sitting through another one. Move.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.502
Mazel tov. Don't fuck in the office.

23:34.164 --> 23:37.334
I gotta say,
the more you do it, the better you get.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.339
Nobody satisfies me like you.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.307
Nice.
