00:44.160 --> 00:49.234
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.640
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.952
<i>Itchy... Itchy...</i>

02:00.440 --> 02:01.634
Boring!

02:01.840 --> 02:03.831
Dad, we can't see the movie.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.828
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

02:08.039 --> 02:11.635
If you ask me, everybody in this
theater is a giant sucker.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.191
Especially you.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.470
<i>Movie on the big screen!</i>

02:51.360 --> 02:54.636
Excuse me.
My heinie is dipping.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.636
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.149
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.512
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.275
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

03:24.480 --> 03:26.835
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.079
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.191
I thought they touched
on a vital issue.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.277
I beg to differ.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.196
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.072
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

04:09.280 --> 04:11.236
...Lord, hear our prayer.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.949
Lord, hear our prayer.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.039
I hate being late.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.309
Well, I hate going.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.476
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way...

04:19.680 --> 04:21.398
...by praying like hell
on my deathbed?

04:21.600 --> 04:23.238
Homer, they can hear you inside.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.560
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.273
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.475
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.830
I'm going to call on one of you!

04:51.400 --> 04:53.789
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.232
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit...

04:58.720 --> 04:59.789
What is it, Ned?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.355
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.471
Gay, gay, gay.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.672
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.628
Somebody else?

05:10.080 --> 05:13.868
Let the Lord's light
shine upon you.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.909
Feel the spirit.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.198
Let it out!

05:22.400 --> 05:25.551
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

05:26.400 --> 05:29.949
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.513
Whoa, Nelly!

05:35.880 --> 05:38.758
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

05:38.960 --> 05:40.109
Twisted tail!

05:40.320 --> 05:41.514
A thousand eyes!

05:41.720 --> 05:43.870
Trapped forever!

05:47.840 --> 05:48.795
Dad, do something!

05:50.160 --> 05:51.718
This book doesn't have any answers!

05:51.920 --> 05:54.309
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

05:58.560 --> 06:01.154
Believe me! Believe me!

06:07.840 --> 06:09.796
Thanks for listening.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.952
Okay, who wants waffles?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.229
I do, I do, I do!

06:17.440 --> 06:18.873
Wait a minute. 
What about Grampa?

06:19.080 --> 06:20.593
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

06:20.800 --> 06:22.392
Something happened to that man.

06:22.600 --> 06:27.071
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

06:27.280 --> 06:32.877
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.429
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

06:35.640 --> 06:39.713
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

06:39.920 --> 06:41.638
Right, Grampa?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.910
I want bananas on my waffles.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.758
I rest my case.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.155
I'm not dropping this.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.994
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.031
Oh, right.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.958
"Take out hornets' nest. "

07:11.320 --> 07:13.276
Check. "Fix sinkhole. "

07:21.560 --> 07:22.959
Check.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.878
"Re-shingle roof"?

07:28.600 --> 07:29.715
Steady.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.674
Steady.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.553
Why, you little...!

07:39.760 --> 07:43.912
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

07:44.120 --> 07:46.998
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.958
What kind of fun?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.479
How about a dare contest?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.719
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

07:53.920 --> 07:55.399
...climb the TV antenna!

07:57.560 --> 07:59.710
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

08:06.200 --> 08:08.031
Aftershock!

08:10.200 --> 08:12.760
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

08:12.960 --> 08:16.635
...but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.314
Shut up, Flanders.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.114
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.956
Steady. Steady.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.229
Steady...

08:31.480 --> 08:33.789
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday...

08:34.000 --> 08:38.835
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

08:43.960 --> 08:48.033
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev...

08:54.360 --> 08:57.670
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.233
Lake Springfield is...

09:09.880 --> 09:11.472
Come on over, Lisa.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.433
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.029
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.800
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.228
Say global warming is a myth.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.716
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

09:24.920 --> 09:27.912
That's for selling out your beliefs.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.959
Oh, poor Milhouse.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.711
Dream coming true.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.309
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over...?

09:36.520 --> 09:37.919
Two thousand gallons a year.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.714
- Turning off lights can save...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.990
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter...

09:43.200 --> 09:46.192
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.833
I'm Colin.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.598
I haven't seen you at school.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.597
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.313
- Is he...?
- He's not Bono.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.796
- I just thought, because you're Irish and...
- He's not Bono.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.355
Do you play?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.516
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.993
<i>He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.</i>

10:05.200 --> 10:08.192
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

10:12.080 --> 10:13.752
You okay there?

10:16.480 --> 10:20.519
<i>Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!</i>

10:21.960 --> 10:23.632
What could that be?

10:23.840 --> 10:26.035
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made...

10:26.240 --> 10:29.152
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.437
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.710
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.200
Never known comfort like this.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.833
Why did I suggest this?

10:55.360 --> 10:57.590
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

10:58.320 --> 11:04.031
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

11:04.240 --> 11:05.992
...naked.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.032
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.355
Girls might see my doodle.

11:09.560 --> 11:14.315
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.308
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken. "

11:18.520 --> 11:20.238
At your wedding, I'll sing:

11:34.040 --> 11:35.837
I like men now.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.073
Don't look where I'm pointing!

11:56.720 --> 11:59.757
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

12:07.960 --> 12:11.873
Boys, before we eat, don't forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful...

12:12.080 --> 12:13.035
Penis?!

12:13.240 --> 12:15.117
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.389
Amen.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.315
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.272
Lunchtime!

12:27.480 --> 12:29.198
You can't just leave me out here.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.676
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.878
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.759
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

12:50.960 --> 12:52.712
Tell him you dared me to do it.

12:52.920 --> 12:57.471
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.151
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

13:02.360 --> 13:05.033
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.708
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

13:07.920 --> 13:09.069
I'm at my wits' end.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.352
It's so...

13:12.800 --> 13:14.597
See you in court, kid.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.836
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.632
Did you at least bring my clothes?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.678
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.350
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.272
This is the worst day of my life.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.392
The worst day of your life so far.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.394
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

13:35.600 --> 13:38.194
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.994
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.350
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.348
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.913
Thank you.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.554
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.034
Of course I do.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.595
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about...?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.949
A pig wearing a hat!

14:05.200 --> 14:06.235
Action.

14:06.760 --> 14:11.197
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.110
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

14:20.040 --> 14:22.270
And we're clear.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.277
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.232
What...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

14:42.360 --> 14:44.635
You're coming home with me.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.954
"A thousand eyes. "
What could that be?

14:52.040 --> 14:55.749
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

14:55.960 --> 15:00.511
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.631
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.638
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.873
Homer!

15:14.480 --> 15:18.951
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.116
Please, get rid of that pig.

15:21.320 --> 15:26.075
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.596
You nailed her.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.598
He also does me.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.675
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.271
Oh, you have so many looks.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.438
So that's what snug is.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.790
Who's a good pig?

16:09.480 --> 16:11.550
Who's a good pig?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.076
Rough day, huh, son?

16:17.760 --> 16:20.513
You don't know what rough is, sister.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.678
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies...

16:23.880 --> 16:25.154
...I take them fishing.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.430
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

16:30.480 --> 16:33.916
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.476
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.399
I think I have a nibble.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.235
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.113
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.117
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.073
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it's on the windowsill.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.959
Oh, my God.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.598
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.191
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you
the best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.868
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.798
He's not imaginary!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.911
Oh, honey, that's great.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.829
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.191
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.073
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

17:50.280 --> 17:52.350
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

17:52.560 --> 17:54.915
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

17:55.120 --> 17:57.270
<i>Can he swing from a web?</i>

17:57.480 --> 17:59.436
<i>No, he can't, he's a pig</i>

17:59.640 --> 18:03.349
<i>Look out
He is the Spider-Pig</i>

18:08.160 --> 18:09.559
Are we having fun yet?

18:09.760 --> 18:11.432
We are now. You've got a bite.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.870
Whoa, mama!

18:14.960 --> 18:16.678
Oh, no, my good pole!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.758
You're not strangling me.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.269
What the...?
Strangling's only good for...

18:25.960 --> 18:27.518
Well, it's not good for anything.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.676
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

18:29.880 --> 18:31.632
...is to give him
a good pat on the back.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.671
Hey, what the hell are you...?

18:37.480 --> 18:39.072
One more time.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.390
Honey, I'm home.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.711
We are at the tipping point, people.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.638
If we don't do something now...

19:05.360 --> 19:08.670
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

19:08.880 --> 19:09.949
Agreed.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.593
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

19:11.800 --> 19:13.791
If we don't change our ways
right now...

19:14.000 --> 19:17.629
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.794
That's not so bad.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.753
No, the lift is stuck.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.835
Am I getting through to anyone?

19:31.040 --> 19:33.474
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.875
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye. "

19:36.080 --> 19:37.752
- Aye.
- No!

19:38.800 --> 19:42.793
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.353
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.189
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.111
This is why we should hate kids.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.719
This is serious, people.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.118
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.594
Code black.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.275
Black? That's the worst color there is.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.119
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.029
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

20:26.240 --> 20:31.837
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.030
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.357
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings. "

20:38.560 --> 20:40.198
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

20:40.400 --> 20:44.552
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.671
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

20:46.880 --> 20:48.836
Try to dump something in the lake.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.678
Okay.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.039
I can't. I simply can't.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.753
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.788
Don't get any ideas.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.915
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.951
What's going on here?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.195
Nothing. Nothing.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.630
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.674
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

21:33.880 --> 21:37.509
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.033
It's leaking.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.630
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

21:44.840 --> 21:48.628
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

21:48.840 --> 21:49.795
Well, I helped.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.074
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

21:56.840 --> 22:00.833
...but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.636
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.877
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.317
Okay, Marge. I will.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.351
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.757
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.915
Hello.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.439
Homer, you gotta get over here.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.110
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

22:38.320 --> 22:41.153
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.670
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.391
Whoa, that was close.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.268
<i>Evil!</i>

23:30.880 --> 23:32.836
Drive, drive, drive!

23:33.280 --> 23:34.838
Oh, right.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.437
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

24:03.640 --> 24:07.155
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.635
Oh, yeah.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.037
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

24:14.360 --> 24:17.636
Well, this certainly seems odd...

24:17.840 --> 24:21.389
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

24:22.440 --> 24:26.513
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.517
Good job.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.316
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

24:31.520 --> 24:33.590
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.439
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.352
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.829
Mr. President.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.389
<i>Ja, that is me.</i>

24:57.600 --> 25:01.115
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.959
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world" that.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.879
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

25:09.080 --> 25:12.595
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.638
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.717
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.873
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

25:22.080 --> 25:25.311
...you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

25:25.520 --> 25:27.590
...to the least successful agency
in government.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.631
And why did I take the job?

25:29.840 --> 25:32.434
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.119
Not the money, but something.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.313
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.114
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

25:41.320 --> 25:43.197
...to five unthinkable options.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.913
Each will cause untold misery...

25:45.120 --> 25:46.553
I pick number three.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.273
You don't wanna read them first?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.950
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

26:31.560 --> 26:34.393
We're being sealed in a dome!

26:36.640 --> 26:38.278
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

26:38.480 --> 26:40.516
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.312
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

26:42.520 --> 26:43.555
I never saw Venice.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.159
"Trapped forever. "

26:58.360 --> 27:00.590
It's all come true.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.236
That crazy old man in church
was right.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.989
Dome!

27:28.200 --> 27:29.758
All right, men, open fire.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.592
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.475
Without the attitude.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.148
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.438
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

27:42.640 --> 27:45.473
...which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.795
It's right there.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.549
Just outside of the dome.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.556
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

27:55.760 --> 27:57.273
<i>The United States government.</i>

27:59.800 --> 28:02.075
<i>My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.</i>

28:03.520 --> 28:04.475
The what?

28:04.680 --> 28:07.035
<i>- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?</i>

28:07.240 --> 28:09.470
<i>Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.</i>

28:09.840 --> 28:12.149
<i>- Springfield has become...
- Springfield!</i>

28:12.400 --> 28:14.755
<i>- the most polluted city
in the history of the planet.</i>

28:14.960 --> 28:16.234
Drama queen!

28:16.800 --> 28:18.438
<i>To keep your poisons
from spreading...</i>

28:18.640 --> 28:20.631
<i>...your government has sealed you
in this dome.</i>

28:22.280 --> 28:23.998
<i>It's the last thing we wanted to do.</i>

28:24.200 --> 28:26.634
<i>I own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.</i>

28:26.840 --> 28:28.478
You mean we're trapped like rats?

28:28.680 --> 28:33.629
<i>No, rats can't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.</i>

28:34.640 --> 28:38.952
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.230
<i>Apparently someone
didn't get the message.</i>

28:43.080 --> 28:44.957
Act natural.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.516
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

28:48.720 --> 28:52.349
<i>Don't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.</i>

28:54.000 --> 28:56.070
<i>Coming up on your right:</i>

28:56.280 --> 28:57.838
<i>Nothing.</i>

28:58.080 --> 29:01.072
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

29:01.280 --> 29:03.236
...it has its own name
and theme music.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.356
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

29:08.560 --> 29:13.475
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.557
Moment, please.

29:18.320 --> 29:22.757
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side. "

29:22.960 --> 29:26.236
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

29:37.600 --> 29:41.149
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.478
Maggie?

29:49.840 --> 29:53.116
<i>We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:55.555
<i>...at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.</i>

29:55.760 --> 29:57.830
<i>Dome Depot!</i>

29:58.040 --> 29:59.951
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

30:02.320 --> 30:05.995
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.350
Marge, she's right here.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.513
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and...

30:13.720 --> 30:14.869
Oh, my God.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.551
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

30:20.400 --> 30:22.038
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

30:37.360 --> 30:39.237
<i>Good evening, 
this is Kent Brockman.</i>

30:39.440 --> 30:42.034
<i>Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime...</i>

30:42.240 --> 30:44.470
<i>...caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.</i>

30:45.440 --> 30:46.475
<i>Until moments ago!</i>

30:47.200 --> 30:50.875
<i>A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.</i>

30:51.560 --> 30:53.915
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.349
Homer, it was you.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.120
You single-handedly killed this town.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.470
I know. It's weird.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.956
<i>Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.</i>

31:10.160 --> 31:12.674
<i>Unless it gets results. Which it will.</i>

31:14.440 --> 31:18.319
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

31:18.520 --> 31:21.910
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.236
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

31:27.120 --> 31:29.315
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

31:37.960 --> 31:41.396
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.432
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:48.439
<i>We want Homer! We want Homer!</i>

31:48.640 --> 31:51.313
You monster. You monster!

31:51.760 --> 31:52.875
Did you see the news?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.911
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.270
But I'm so angry.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.790
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.548
Okay.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.994
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

32:08.200 --> 32:10.395
...and apologize for what you did.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.717
I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door,
they'll take all of you.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.831
No, we won't. 
We just want Homer!

32:16.040 --> 32:18.156
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.998
I'm part of the mob!

32:22.600 --> 32:24.477
Teeny! Take out the baby.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.996
Here, let me get that for you.

32:46.440 --> 32:49.034
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.875
Bart!

33:01.080 --> 33:02.479
Crawl across. Hurry.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.875
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.594
I'm sure your father would
do the same for...

33:08.880 --> 33:11.075
Point taken. 
Now, hustle your bustles.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.919
Archers.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.988
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

33:22.360 --> 33:26.273
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.233
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.398
Wait! 
There's something I have to get.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.758
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.310
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

34:05.280 --> 34:07.157
We lost them.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.672
Up here.

34:24.040 --> 34:24.995
Get them! Get them!

34:29.639 --> 34:30.914
Little help?

34:35.360 --> 34:37.954
You know, the word "apology"...

34:38.159 --> 34:43.632
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here...

34:54.760 --> 34:57.479
Mom, what are we gonna do?

34:59.600 --> 35:00.874
Maggie, not now.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.635
We'll play later.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.272
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

35:14.480 --> 35:16.471
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

35:21.600 --> 35:24.068
So long, losers!

35:30.080 --> 35:33.072
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

36:05.640 --> 36:09.394
Well, they're China's problem now.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.075
Colin!

36:26.640 --> 36:28.676
I can't hear you!

36:48.080 --> 36:52.232
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is...

36:52.440 --> 36:55.796
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

36:57.040 --> 36:58.758
perfect.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.509
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.798
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.274
Damn it!

37:19.480 --> 37:22.278
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.833
And so nobody else gets out...

37:24.040 --> 37:26.600
...I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.028
I want 10,000 tough guys...

37:28.240 --> 37:31.312
...and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.592
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

37:34.800 --> 37:39.590
...soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.998
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.034
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.158
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.510
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.029
You'll stop right now.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.559
You come back here, little man.

38:31.440 --> 38:35.638
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

38:36.160 --> 38:37.957
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.515
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.278
Hey, guys?

38:42.720 --> 38:45.154
What's the secret knock, again?

38:47.920 --> 38:51.230
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.715
It's huge! We're homeless!

38:53.920 --> 38:55.911
Our friends wanna kill us!

38:56.120 --> 38:58.429
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

38:58.640 --> 39:00.995
...I need to know what was
going through your mind...

39:01.200 --> 39:03.395
...when you didn't listen to me...

39:03.600 --> 39:06.956
...and dumped that silo in the lake.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.355
Homer!

39:08.560 --> 39:12.030
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.276
I respect people who do...

39:14.480 --> 39:19.759
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.469
I mean, oh.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.674
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry...

39:27.880 --> 39:29.632
...I'm prepared with a solution.

39:30.200 --> 39:34.239
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.953
And that plan is right here!

39:41.040 --> 39:41.995
No.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.235
Nope.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.998
Bingo.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.794
Bear with me.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.635
Alaska?

39:55.840 --> 39:59.628
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.432
Where no one says things like:

40:01.640 --> 40:04.871
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate. "

40:05.560 --> 40:07.118
I don't know, Homie.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.639
I'm not saying it right.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.389
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.239
And I've really come to like you guys.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.468
I just don't see it.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.869
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

40:28.080 --> 40:30.230
"I need you to do this with me. "

40:32.680 --> 40:35.956
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.351
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.152
Thank you, my sweetheart.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.432
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

40:49.040 --> 40:50.792
You just bought
another load of crap...

40:51.000 --> 40:53.912
...from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.509
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

40:56.720 --> 40:57.675
Homer!

40:57.880 --> 41:01.031
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

41:01.240 --> 41:05.518
All right, son. If you don't believe in me,
believe in America.

41:06.160 --> 41:11.996
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.471
Step right up and win my truck!

41:16.680 --> 41:19.831
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.359
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.314
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.511
Three tries for $ 10.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.872
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.679
That counts as a try.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.472
That's two.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.869
And that's three.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.719
Here's what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

41:46.920 --> 41:48.319
I'll give you one on the house.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.272
- You're the best.
- Dad!

41:50.480 --> 41:53.995
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

41:54.200 --> 41:57.033
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

42:08.680 --> 42:10.113
Yes!

42:12.160 --> 42:13.957
Yay, Dad!

42:20.720 --> 42:22.836
I'll take that truck now.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.789
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.350
Next stop, Alaska!

42:38.920 --> 42:40.831
<i>Day 37 under the dome.</i>

42:41.040 --> 42:44.749
<i>We are facing intermittent
power failures which...</i>

42:47.760 --> 42:50.877
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.038
When they come back on,
I want all my booze back the way it was.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.478
Yeah, okay. Okay.

43:07.880 --> 43:11.714
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.115
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.515
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to...

43:24.880 --> 43:26.279
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.153
We need diapers.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.476
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.511
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.554
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.433
Just give us beef jerky.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.279
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.233
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

43:46.440 --> 43:47.714
Sure.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.036
Oh, my God. There they are!

44:11.840 --> 44:15.594
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

44:16.840 --> 44:19.991
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.236
I have two buttons behind this desk.

44:22.440 --> 44:26.877
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.754
Reach me. Make me your brother.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.070
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.474
Lives will be lost.

44:33.800 --> 44:37.270
"Lives lost. " Go on.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.472
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.955
Tempting. Tempting.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.798
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.549
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.599
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

45:02.280 --> 45:05.955
What...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

45:06.160 --> 45:07.559
Oh, that's better.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.432
Homer!

45:15.600 --> 45:18.319
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

45:29.040 --> 45:32.112
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.788
Well, it's about time! But why?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.877
We pay every resident $ 1000...

45:37.080 --> 45:39.878
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.071
I'm home!

45:42.280 --> 45:44.077
Oh, thanks.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.558
What are you doing, Bart?

46:02.760 --> 46:04.159
Just passing the time.

46:17.240 --> 46:20.676
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.235
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad...

46:23.440 --> 46:24.839
Clap for Alaska!

46:41.320 --> 46:45.518
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.315
All my dreams are coming true.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.712
We're going to need more birds.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.078
Day 93 under the dome.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.475
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

47:45.680 --> 47:48.513
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

47:49.880 --> 47:51.996
<i>- Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
- Again?</i>

47:52.200 --> 47:54.760
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

47:54.960 --> 47:58.475
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

48:00.360 --> 48:02.271
We're out of coffee!

48:04.320 --> 48:07.437
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

48:17.840 --> 48:19.637
Take that.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.399
Oh, no! Blowback!

48:27.600 --> 48:29.192
Look what they're doing to our dome.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.714
You know what that is, sir?

48:37.920 --> 48:39.558
- A crack?
- Exactly.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.797
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.719
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations...

48:47.160 --> 48:49.515
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.396
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.034
In fact, I have five solutions.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.595
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.518
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.397
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

49:03.600 --> 49:07.354
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.790
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.197
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

49:14.240 --> 49:15.719
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.638
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

49:17.840 --> 49:18.909
- Three?
- You said three.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.838
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.314
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.870
<i>Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?</i>

49:38.080 --> 49:40.833
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

49:41.040 --> 49:45.192
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

49:45.400 --> 49:47.436
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.835
The U.S. government
has lost its credibility...

49:50.040 --> 49:51.632
...so it's borrowing some of mine.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.159
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.237
Sure thing, son.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.878
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.435
<i>This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.</i>

50:03.920 --> 50:05.433
That's where Springfield is!

50:05.640 --> 50:07.915
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

50:08.120 --> 50:09.235
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

50:09.440 --> 50:12.318
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

50:12.840 --> 50:13.795
Did you see that?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.594
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.472
But we're going to stop them.

50:18.680 --> 50:21.353
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

50:21.560 --> 50:23.755
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

50:25.160 --> 50:28.072
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

50:28.280 --> 50:31.317
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.795
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

50:34.000 --> 50:36.673
<i>- It was 7 at night.
- It was during Access Hollywood.</i>

50:36.880 --> 50:38.632
Which is on at 4 and 7.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.511
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

50:42.720 --> 50:44.438
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.596
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

50:46.800 --> 50:47.915
I wish he was.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.031
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.470
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.075
Look at it.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.072
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.679
Why, you little...!

50:58.640 --> 51:00.119
I'll strangle-angle you!

51:00.320 --> 51:01.548
Diddily-diddily.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.990
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.952
Homer...

51:07.480 --> 51:10.870
...in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

51:11.080 --> 51:14.038
"I need you to do this with me. "

51:15.440 --> 51:18.989
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.315
Homer Simpson!

51:20.520 --> 51:21.999
We're saving Springfield!

51:22.200 --> 51:24.270
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.959
We have a great life in Alaska...

51:26.160 --> 51:29.277
...and we're never going
back to America again.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.357
I have spoken!

51:50.240 --> 51:55.109
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.234
Marge? Kids?

52:22.040 --> 52:23.837
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

52:24.040 --> 52:25.359
<i>Homer...</i>

52:25.560 --> 52:27.437
<i>...I've always stood up for you.</i>

52:27.640 --> 52:30.632
<i>When people point out your flaws...</i>

52:30.840 --> 52:32.558
<i>...I always say:</i>

52:32.760 --> 52:37.629
<i>"Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art. "</i>

52:38.840 --> 52:40.273
Way back.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.597
<i>Lately, what's keeping us together...</i>

52:43.800 --> 52:47.873
<i>...is my ability to overlook
everything you do.</i>

52:48.080 --> 52:51.675
<i>And I overlook these things
because...</i>

52:52.000 --> 52:53.194
Because?

52:54.160 --> 52:56.230
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

52:56.440 --> 53:00.513
<i>I just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.</i>

53:01.280 --> 53:04.909
<i>So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...</i>

53:05.120 --> 53:07.634
<i>...and we're never coming back.</i>

53:10.600 --> 53:14.115
<i>And to prove to myself
that this is the end...</i>

53:15.320 --> 53:19.029
<i>...I taped this over our wedding video.</i>

53:20.280 --> 53:22.316
<i>Goodbye, Homie.</i>

53:35.160 --> 53:37.799
<i>I love you.</i>

53:41.200 --> 53:43.555
Marge? Kids?

54:33.840 --> 54:36.593
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

54:36.800 --> 54:38.438
Looking through people's luggage.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.438
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

54:41.640 --> 54:44.996
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

54:45.200 --> 54:49.113
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.709
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

54:51.920 --> 54:56.038
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.270
<i>Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.</i>

55:06.480 --> 55:09.472
<i>I like meat, but I don't know
if I'm ready to love again.</i>

55:09.680 --> 55:12.797
<i>- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.</i>

55:13.000 --> 55:14.274
<i>Okay.</i>

55:14.480 --> 55:16.232
<i>She hung up on me!</i>

55:16.440 --> 55:20.592
<i>But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.</i>

55:20.920 --> 55:22.592
Hey, everybody, I found one!

55:22.800 --> 55:26.509
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

55:26.720 --> 55:28.472
Yeah, baby, yeah!

55:30.160 --> 55:31.354
Homer Simpson...

55:33.240 --> 55:34.958
...do you know why you are here?

55:35.160 --> 55:38.914
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.395
Drink this liquid.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.193
More, please.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.951
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

55:48.160 --> 55:51.232
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.476
Throat singing?

56:03.600 --> 56:05.113
How long are we doing this?

56:05.320 --> 56:08.917
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

56:12.240 --> 56:13.229
What's an epiphany?

56:13.440 --> 56:16.352
Sudden realization of great truth.

56:16.560 --> 56:17.515
Okay.

56:31.480 --> 56:34.916
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

56:35.120 --> 56:38.351
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

56:38.560 --> 56:39.629
<i>Look out!</i>

56:40.080 --> 56:43.868
<i>He's a Spider-Pig</i>

56:45.360 --> 56:47.396
Unless you have an epiphany...

56:47.600 --> 56:51.354
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.548
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

56:55.240 --> 56:58.550
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.193
Americans will never embrace soccer?

57:05.240 --> 57:08.038
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

57:10.640 --> 57:12.676
Hey, what are you doing?

57:16.080 --> 57:20.676
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.675
<i>Because...?</i>

57:25.280 --> 57:29.478
Because other people
are just as important as me.

57:29.840 --> 57:33.799
Without them, I'm nothing.

57:35.520 --> 57:38.751
In order to save myself...

57:38.960 --> 57:41.394
...I have to save Springfield!

57:41.600 --> 57:44.353
That's it! Isn't it?

57:56.440 --> 57:59.238
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

57:59.440 --> 58:04.434
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

58:04.760 --> 58:06.432
Thank you, boob lady.

58:13.840 --> 58:16.832
This is it, kids. Seattle.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.918
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

58:23.520 --> 58:24.999
Yes, I did.

58:29.720 --> 58:31.392
Run! Run!

58:31.960 --> 58:33.552
Run! Run!

58:34.040 --> 58:35.758
Run! Run!

58:36.440 --> 58:38.317
Jump! Jump!

58:38.520 --> 58:40.431
Land! Land!

58:40.880 --> 58:42.757
Rest! Rest!

58:43.440 --> 58:44.759
Run! Run!

58:47.320 --> 58:49.311
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

58:49.520 --> 58:52.353
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and...

58:55.320 --> 58:56.912
That's my whipping arm!

58:59.920 --> 59:03.435
Why does everything I whip leave me?

59:04.720 --> 59:08.679
Must keep going. Must keep going.

59:08.880 --> 59:12.668
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

59:12.880 --> 59:14.871
Yes, you can.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.798
No, I can't!

59:17.000 --> 59:18.592
Oh, shut up!

59:18.800 --> 59:20.313
You shut up.

59:20.520 --> 59:22.272
No, you. No, you.

59:22.480 --> 59:25.153
No, you. Oh, real mature.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.555
How could you say that?

59:27.760 --> 59:29.671
Oh, what's the point?

59:29.880 --> 59:32.110
It's hopeless.

59:39.760 --> 59:43.196
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.958
But which way do I go?

59:50.160 --> 59:51.878
Much obliged.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.676
Ten-hut!

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.790
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:15.955
Lisa!

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.635
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.273
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.716
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.273
I hope it's okay.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.870
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.229
Just move on.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.712
Let us out! Let us out!

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.990
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.156
I hope I do.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.272
Oh, way to go, Bart.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.799
You stink.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.595
No, you stink.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.912
Springfield.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.470
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.119
Oh, man.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.475
Oh, hi, Midge.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.671
Moe, what happened?

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.158
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.679
Why are you dressed like that?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.112
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am now the emperor of Springfield.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.594
No, you're not!

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.995
Yes, I am!

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.628
Okay. Hail, emperor.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.796
<i>Attention, Springfield.</i>

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.239
<i>Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.</i>

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.637
<i>Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.</i>

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.759
<i>Which involves killing you all.</i>

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.468
<i>As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.</i>

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.908
Despite everything, I miss your father.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.712
Me too.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.480
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.835
Ten-hut!

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.710
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.195
...and I have an urgent note
from the president.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.675
It says to release
this town immediately.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.394
Why is it written on a leaf?

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.875
Perfect.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.995
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.677
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.953
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.037
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.869
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.630
My time to shine.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.232
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.073
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.272
Look what I can do with my thumb.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.951
You wanna know how I do it?

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.355
<i>Four generations of inbreeding?</i>

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.958
I can smell fresh air.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.836
I can hear birds.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.235
I taste freedom.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.476
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.479
<i>I was tricked by an idiot.</i>

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:42.073
Hey, I know how you feel.
I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.679
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.634
Homer do good?

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.750
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.279
But I...

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.754
I can't do anything right.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.710
Get out of here!

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.508
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.280
And now there's only time to say:

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.232
Life well spent!

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.556
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.478
Will Buddha be there too?

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.715
No.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.758
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.828
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.678
Thanks.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.158
Listen. I was just wondering if...

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.396
...before I died...

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.309
...I could pretend I had a father who...

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.873
...cared for me.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.639
Come here, son.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.991
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.751
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.272
<i>Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.</i>

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.038
<i>So much pressure.</i>

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.354
<i>Pressure!</i>

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.192
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.155
Marge.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.510
Marge! Marge!

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.517
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.349
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.677
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.080
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.114
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.072
Risking my life to save people I hate...

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.794
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.111
But first, one stop.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.314
Bart? Son?

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.430
You think you could find it
in your heart...

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.154
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.193
Oh, I don't know.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.834
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that...

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.157
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.591
No. I can't do it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.787
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.228
What's that word?

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.667
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.279
Thanks, losers.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:43.549
Sorry, Homer.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.234
I'll let you hold the bomb.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.953
The man knows me.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.470
I wish Homer was my father.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.513
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:12.035
I've been taking your crap all my life!

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.956
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.912
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.350
Dad, in case I miss...

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.120
...I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.357
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.120
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:40.518
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of...

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.279
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.511
What? What's going on?

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.268
We did it, boy!

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.073
Dad?

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.913
It's amazing no one was hurt.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.433
Bye, everybody.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.831
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.235
Hello, Homer.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.589
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.712
There's two things they don't teach you
at Harvard Business School.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.514
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.109
I'm going to do both right now.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.390
Wait! If you kill my dad...

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.750
...you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.949
What treasure?

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.873
The Treasure of Imawiener.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.115
I'm a wiener?

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.915
Classic.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.190
Well, always leave them laughing.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.753
Goodbye, sir.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.231
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.753
Colin? Colin!

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.873
Lisa? Colin's dead.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.436
But his last words were:

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:34.033
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand. "

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.075
I got her all warmed up for you.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.475
Colin. Hi.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.716
- Hey, you wanna go...?
- Clean up the lake?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.480
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.118
I like ice cream.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.156
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.868
Boy! You survived! How?

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.832
I did things no dog should do.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.917
They will haunt me forever.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.475
I love you too.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.274
Best kiss of my life.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.119
Best kiss of your life so far.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.069
Steady.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.150
Steady.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.470
Steady.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.033
Dad?

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.592
Thanks, boy.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.155
Steady.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.878
They've taken everything, sir.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.915
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide...

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.510
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.914
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.873
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.029
<i>#Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig#</i>

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.189
<i>#Does whatever a Spider-Pig does#</i>

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.513
<i>#Can he swing from a web?#</i>

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.871
<i>#No, he can't, he's a pig#</i>

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.308
<i>#Look out!#</i>

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.389
<i>#He is a Spider-Pig#</i>

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.308
<i>#Look out!#</i>

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:28.513
<i>#He is a Spider-Pig#</i>

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.908
Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.078
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.239
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.749
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed...

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.793
...during the filming of this movie.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.355
Okay.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.395
Floor popcorn.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.119
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.993
Oh, my God. Her first word.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.551
Sequel?

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.551
<i>Springfield doesn't have an anthem</i>

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.514
<i>We thought we had one
But we don't</i>

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.395
<i>We paid a short guy to write it</i>

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.229
<i>But we never saw him again</i>

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.069
<i>The tune we stole from the French</i>

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.511
<i>There's a few things they do well</i>

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.599
<i>Like making love, wine and cheese</i>

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.588
<i>Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries</i>

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.429
<i>Springfield, we're going to die</i>

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.191
<i>Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye</i>

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.993
Assistant manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.036
Four years of film school for this?

01:23:01.305 --> 01:23:07.381
