00:00.868 --> 00:04.372
(upbeat electronic music)

00:15.783 --> 00:19.153
(tense electronic music)

00:30.364 --> 00:33.367
(heavy metal music)

01:05.566 --> 01:08.502
(flames whooshing)

01:10.238 --> 01:13.241
(heavy metal music)

02:03.157 --> 02:06.093
(flames crackling)

02:37.191 --> 02:39.960
(fire whooshing)

02:44.832 --> 02:47.801
(clock ticking)

02:47.835 --> 02:51.672
(suspenseful electronic music)

03:06.887 --> 03:09.557
(clock ticking)

03:16.997 --> 03:17.831
- You're late.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.233
- And you are stunning.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.001
Have you done something
new with your hair?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.069
- No, I didn't.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.838
Please don't play
with my creatures.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.007
We're backlogged as it is.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.409
- I like playing
with your creatures

03:28.409 --> 03:30.143
and touching them and
all that good stuff

03:30.177 --> 03:32.513
and oh, ah your
claws are showing.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.547
- They always are.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.017
- Okay, well I'm gonna need
two things from you, Lilith.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.254
First, I'm gonna need 60
seconds before I get in there.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.088
- No.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.256
No, no.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.223
Okay, what you can
do, go to your office.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.024
Because we're backlogged.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.025
- Don't you want to know

03:45.025 --> 03:45.759
what the other thing is?
- No.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.827
Office.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.362
Backlogged.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.029
- Can I please stay and
play with your creatures?

03:49.029 --> 03:50.197
- No, no, no.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.101
- You know I'm your boss, right,

03:54.101 --> 03:55.102
and I can hang out here
as long as I want to?

03:56.570 --> 03:57.738
All right, you
get away this time

03:57.771 --> 04:00.073
but just know this isn't over.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.609
- Okay, great.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.210
- I still love you.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.445
- Good for you.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.946
- See you later.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.715
- Probably not.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.782
Probably not.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
- All right.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.428
You got this, Asmodeus.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.964
All right, so you're the boss.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.435
You're gonna make
today your bitch.

04:27.435 --> 04:31.138
Think, think Weinstein.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.239
Think Weinstein.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.375
You're gonna take today,

04:35.776 --> 04:38.111
you're gonna bring today
to a very sleazy motel

04:40.113 --> 04:41.782
and you're gonna make today

04:41.782 --> 04:43.250
do things it
wouldn't normally do

04:43.283 --> 04:45.118
under these particular
circumstances

04:45.118 --> 04:47.054
and then she's not gonna
say anything for 20 years.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.088
It's gonna be lovely.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.290
Weinstein, okay.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.960
I gotta call that guy.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.430
Lilith, could you please
send in the first client?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.078
Mr. Richard Hackett,
as I live and breath.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.180
How the heck are you?

05:13.180 --> 05:14.281
- Where am I?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.916
I mean, what is this place

05:15.916 --> 05:18.352
and who are you?

05:18.352 --> 05:19.687
- Why don't we figure this out

05:19.687 --> 05:21.355
with a little bit
of conversation?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.091
Good boy.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.594
Okay, as for why you are here,

05:26.627 --> 05:28.295
as you so skittishly asked,

05:28.295 --> 05:30.798
because you have
been a very bad boy

05:30.798 --> 05:32.600
and it's my job to figure out

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
how bad of a boy you've been.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.638
That way, we can figure out
how you fit in down here.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.540
- But I didn't do anything.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.542
- Let me be the judge of that.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.110
(tense music)

05:43.143 --> 05:44.845
Okay, Rick, I'm gonna ask
you a couple of questions,

05:44.845 --> 05:47.347
just standard
procedure, of course.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.849
Cool?

05:48.849 --> 05:49.683
Okay.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.052
Have you ever killed
anyone before?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.521
- No.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.354
- Have you ever
raped anyone before?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.556
- God no!

05:55.623 --> 05:57.124
- Have you ever
willingly listened

05:57.124 --> 05:58.992
to a Dave Matthews Band CD?

06:01.395 --> 06:02.896
It's a simple yes or
no question, Rick.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.698
- This is ridiculous.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.701
I have done absolutely
nothing wrong.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.369
All you have to do
is look in my file

06:09.369 --> 06:11.872
and you'll see I'm not
supposed to be here.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.807
- That's the first
time I heard that one.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.976
Why don't we take a
walk down memory lane

06:15.976 --> 06:17.811
and you can tell me your story?

06:17.811 --> 06:20.748
Just keep in mind, it
better be a good one.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.750
'Cause the stakes
are very very high.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.769
(suspenseful music)

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
(man groaning)

07:33.887 --> 07:36.890
(suspenseful music)

07:44.131 --> 07:44.965
- Coffee?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.803
- So, how's your dating life?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
- Oh.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.808
Not good.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.780
(suspenseful music)

08:05.653 --> 08:07.120
- Renee?

08:07.120 --> 08:07.955
- That's me.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.489
- Hi, I'm Richard.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.323
It's nice to finally meet you.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.158
- You, too.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.336
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.872
- No, no not at all.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.339
Actually, I didn't even
know this place was here.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.042
- Yeah, I love little
mom and pop diners.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.511
I know it's nothing fancy,

08:31.511 --> 08:34.147
but they always give me
that feeling of family.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.152
You don't get that with a
big corporate restaurant.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.320
I hope that's okay.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.688
- Yeah, yeah.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.522
This is great.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.194
So, uh.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.164
- See, this is the problem
with online dating.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.133
When you finally
meet the person,

08:53.133 --> 08:54.501
you have nothing to talk about.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.704
- Well, even though
we've been talking

08:56.704 --> 08:59.573
for a couple weeks now,
I think we'll manage.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.742
Now you said you're originally
from Lakewood, right?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.243
- Yes, sir.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.477
Born and raised

09:04.511 --> 09:06.413
and you've always
lived in Akron, right?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.582
- Well since I was
six years old, yeah.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.551
My parents were originally
from Poughkeepsie, New York

09:11.551 --> 09:14.855
but I barely remember
anything about that.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.723
- Why not?

09:17.591 --> 09:18.425
- Well, I mean.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.661
I was six, so.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.197
- Oh okay, I get it.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.236
Also you said you worked
as a claims adjuster.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.070
What's that?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.707
- Basically my job
is to figure out

09:33.741 --> 09:36.176
how much an insurance
company is liable

09:36.176 --> 09:38.011
for when a claim is submitted.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.748
- I'm not following you.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.385
- Well like, if a client
has a car accident

09:45.418 --> 09:48.255
or a fire or some
other type situation

09:48.255 --> 09:50.590
I'm called in to
assess the damage

09:50.590 --> 09:53.526
and figure out how much
we're willing to pay out.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.962
- No, not a clue.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.464
- Okay.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.468
Let's say you're in
a car accident, okay?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.804
- [Renee] Okay.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.973
- And you have insurance, right?

10:05.973 --> 10:06.807
- No.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.042
- What do you mean no?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.780
- I mean I don't
have any insurance.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.948
- You know that's illegal right?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.618
- I don't think that's true.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.653
- Yes, it is.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.925
- Well, even if it
is, it doesn't matter.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.460
Because I've never
been into an accident.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.931
- But what if you do?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.465
- But I haven't.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.467
- But let's just
say that you do.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.603
- I have a perfect
driving record.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.838
- That doesn't matter.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.272
I mean things happen.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.143
- I just think it's a
waste of money, is all.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.444
- I think you'd feel differently

10:44.477 --> 10:46.847
if you were ever in
an actual accident.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.615
- Well, I guess we'll never know

10:48.648 --> 10:51.985
because I don't plan on
getting into an accident.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.987
- I don't think
anybody ever plans

10:53.987 --> 10:55.588
on being in an accident.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.425
- How you both doing tonight?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.260
- You're being incredibly rude.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.295
We're in the middle of
a conversation here.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.866
- I'm sorry.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.435
I was just wondering if
I could start you two

11:08.468 --> 11:09.803
off with some drinks.

11:09.837 --> 11:10.938
- Well you should be.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.205
Now go away.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.807
We'll call you if you're needed.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.946
Can you believe the
nerve of that woman?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.981
- She's just doing her job.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.515
- Oh that's just an excuse.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.018
No one has any manners anymore.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.022
- I think you might be
overreacting a little bit.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.125
(lighthearted music)

11:41.869 --> 11:43.203
- You know what?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.238
You're right, I'm sorry.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.140
I guess I just must be nervous.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.242
Us meeting for the
first time and all.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.544
- It's okay.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.884
You have absolutely nothing
to be nervous about.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.821
- Thank you.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.990
You really are an
amazing person.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.863
- Now you said you work
in collections, right?

12:09.863 --> 12:10.898
- Yeah, that's right.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.565
I get to chase down the scumbags

12:13.500 --> 12:15.168
who don't pay their bills.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.169
- That sounds tough.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.238
- Not really.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.572
I just do it for the money.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.775
It's not my true
passion whatsoever.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.411
- What's your passion?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.847
- I volunteer at my church.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.450
My faith in God is
extremely important to me.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.086
- That's really nice.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.621
I'll bet that's
really rewarding.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.723
- It's extremely rewarding.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.391
My relationship with God

12:38.591 --> 12:40.627
is the most important
thing in my life.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.298
Do you have a relationship
with God, Richard?

12:50.938 --> 12:54.942
- I don't know if you
could it a relationship.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.743
I mean, I would consider
myself spiritual

12:56.743 --> 12:58.145
but--
- Don't worry.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.479
We can fix that.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.619
So, Richard.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.457
Rick.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.726
Dick for short.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.594
(Renee chuckling)

13:14.594 --> 13:16.329
Short dick Rick.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.066
(Renee laughing)

13:21.801 --> 13:23.971
I'm joking, of course.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.239
I don't care if you
have a short dick.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.241
I have a tiny vagina.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.944
(Renee laughing)

13:40.921 --> 13:42.755
- Miss, I think
we're ready to order.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.665
So, I know you said
that you've been single

13:52.699 --> 13:54.367
for about two years now.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.469
Have you had any luck whatsoever

13:56.503 --> 13:58.505
on meeting somebody on the site?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.806
- Not at all.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.308
They should call that
site Plenty of Losers

14:01.308 --> 14:03.010
because that's all
that's on there.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.713
Not you, of course.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.948
You're great.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.884
I'm talking about
everyone else on there.

14:10.884 --> 14:11.718
- No, no I get it.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.020
Trust me.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.355
I've had my fair
share of bad ones.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.057
- What's the worst
date you've ever had

14:17.057 --> 14:18.291
with someone on the site?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.296
- Well.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.899
I would have to say

14:27.167 --> 14:29.402
a girl I went out with
about two months ago.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.704
Before the waiter
even got to the table,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.740
she burst into tears
talking about how much

14:33.806 --> 14:37.177
she still loved her husband and
she didn't want the divorce.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.013
Could not be anymore awkward.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.881
- Yeah, that's a bad one.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.150
But I can top it.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.486
Last year I was seeing
this guy from the site,

14:46.486 --> 14:48.021
pretty much exclusively.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.723
Things were going
great, I thought,

14:50.723 --> 14:53.927
until I walked in on
him in the bathroom

14:53.994 --> 14:56.496
and he was shooting
up into his dick.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.530
Yeah.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.831
He claimed it was steroids,

14:58.831 --> 15:01.168
but I don't know,
could of been heroin.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.335
It was completely insane.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.371
So I just broke the
whole thing off.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.709
The relationship, I mean.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.743
Not his dick.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.348
- Wow.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.885
That is a bad one.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.089
- Yeah, and... took me
forever to get rid of him.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.690
Stupid asshole.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.393
He kept calling,
showing up at my house.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.095
I had to get a
restraining order.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.798
I kept telling him,

15:31.798 --> 15:33.566
Jeremy, leave me the hell alone.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.768
I don't want anything to do
with your creepy stalking

15:35.768 --> 15:37.437
and your drug
riddled meat stick.

15:43.910 --> 15:48.915
- So, if you could pick the
three best qualities about you,

15:50.083 --> 15:50.984
what would they be?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.387
- We're not really going
to do this, are we?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.824
- We don't have to.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.559
I just thought it
might a nice way

15:59.592 --> 16:00.793
to get to know each other.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.296
- Okay.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.998
I would have to say

16:04.998 --> 16:09.469
my sparkling personality,

16:09.469 --> 16:10.970
my stunning good looks,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.940
and I have a non-existent
Ray-Ray count.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.143
- What's a Ray-Ray count?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.844
- I don't fuck black guys.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.778
Never have.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.317
I'm really hate to do this

16:24.317 --> 16:26.653
but I have to use the restroom.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.521
- Sure, that's no problem.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.756
- I had three cups of
coffee this morning

16:29.789 --> 16:31.358
and it's starting to fight back,

16:31.358 --> 16:32.592
if you know what I mean.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.995
I think I just turned on
my Ronco Underwear Juicer.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.631
- Okay.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.866
Sure.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.201
- [Renee] Thanks,
you're the best.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.813
- It's like how would
that have bearing on it

16:53.846 --> 16:55.782
one way or the other, you know?

16:55.782 --> 16:56.683
I don't know, he's nuts.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.517
Anyway, what's up with you?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.187
- You know what?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.521
I'm gonna run to the
restroom real quick, so.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.355
- [Man] Oh, okay.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.126
Don't fall in.
- I'll be back.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.997
- Is it okay for
me to take these?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.632
- Yeah, thank you so much.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.135
By the way, I'm
really sorry about

17:15.166 --> 17:16.669
how my date treated you earlier.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.739
That was completely
uncalled for.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.008
- No worries, I
deal with all kinds.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.576
- Well, you shouldn't have to.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.413
Again, I'm sorry.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.646
- Well thank you.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.549
So how's the date
going, anyways?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.383
- Honestly.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.919
Not good.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.521
(both chuckling)

17:34.554 --> 17:35.388
- Kinda figured.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.256
First date?

17:36.256 --> 17:37.490
- Yeah, yeah.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.825
- At least you found
out early, right?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.160
- True.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.994
It's just, we
seemed so compatible

17:41.994 --> 17:43.830
over the phone and text.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.234
- Nobody acts the way
they really are at first.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.669
- I guess.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.538
- Dating's tough these days.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.505
It's not it used to be.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.374
- You can say that again.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.908
- Is there a problem here?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.110
- Jesus, you scared me.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.113
- What the hell is
going on over here?

18:00.113 --> 18:01.281
(tense music)

18:01.348 --> 18:03.383
- Our waitress was just
clearing the table.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.251
- That's bullshit.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.752
I'm gone for two minutes

18:05.752 --> 18:07.287
and I come back to find you
flirting with this bitch?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.622
- No, it wasn't
like that at all.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.858
- So you weren't
flirting with her?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.360
- Not in the least bit, no.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.463
- You heard him, tramp.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.364
Fuck off.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.532
- Ma'am, you have

18:19.566 --> 18:21.434
the wrong idea.
- I said, fuck off.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.104
(tense music)

18:39.452 --> 18:41.120
If this is going to work,

18:41.154 --> 18:43.723
you're going to have to start
sticking up for yourself.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.794
I can't be around 24 hours a
day to defend you, you know?

18:50.330 --> 18:54.167
- I don't think this
is gonna work at all.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.769
(tense music)

18:56.803 --> 19:00.106
- What are you talking about?

19:00.106 --> 19:01.274
- Look.

19:01.308 --> 19:05.077
You seem like a really
really nice girl.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.615
I just don't think that
you and I mesh well.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.484
- Mesh well, what the
hell does that mean?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.585
- I'm sorry.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.786
- You're sorry?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.655
What were the last
two weeks about?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.825
You certainly seemed to
think we meshed well then.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.694
- I know but you can't
really get a good feel

19:21.694 --> 19:23.095
for someone in text.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.464
You know what I'm saying?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.998
- So you were lying to me.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.667
- No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.668
It's just--

19:28.668 --> 19:29.636
- It's just what, motherfucker?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.170
Spit it out.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.175
- I don't think we should
see each other again.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.347
(tense music)

19:41.648 --> 19:43.316
- Come on, Richard.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.385
You don't really
mean that, do you?

19:45.385 --> 19:48.321
- I'm sorry, Renee,
yeah I really do.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.525
- Richard.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.832
- That's inappropriate.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.303
- You son of a bitch.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.137
You shower me with affection,

20:05.137 --> 20:07.006
you make me fall
in love with you

20:07.039 --> 20:08.675
and then you pull this shit.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.843
- Make you fall in love with me?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.579
We've been talking
for like two weeks.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.880
- Don't interrupt me.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.081
You're just a fuck boy.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.750
- A fuck boy?

20:17.750 --> 20:18.585
Really?

20:18.585 --> 20:19.819
- Really.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.255
You just want to fuck
with a girl's emotions.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.592
Well I'm not gonna
let that happen.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.160
You and I have something
really special here.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.064
Something that doesn't
come along very often

20:32.064 --> 20:33.500
and I'm not gonna
let you throw it away

20:33.533 --> 20:35.268
because of your idiocy.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.340
- Right.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.509
Miss, can we get
the check please?

20:42.509 --> 20:43.943
(tense music)

20:43.943 --> 20:45.678
- So will this be
separate checks?

20:45.712 --> 20:48.180
- You're making a big mistake.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.716
- No, it's okay, I've got it.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.584
- It's no trouble, really.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.688
(tense electronic music)

20:55.688 --> 20:58.858
(woman screaming)

20:58.891 --> 20:59.726
(woman gasping)

20:59.759 --> 21:02.128
(tense music)

21:36.896 --> 21:38.230
- Nobody move.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.833
Shut the fuck up, sit down now!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.270
(tense music)

21:52.144 --> 21:54.180
Don't even try it, fat boy.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.248
I'll end you right there.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.685
(tense music)

22:08.094 --> 22:11.431
You know, I think our
date might be derailed.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.932
What do you say we start over?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.803
- Please, don't do this.

22:18.004 --> 22:18.838
- Do what?

22:20.673 --> 22:23.142
- You have to let
these people go.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.377
- No, I don't.

22:24.377 --> 22:27.213
I don't have to do
anything expect breathe.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.185
- I'm asking you to
please put the gun down.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.290
- I may be willing
to consider that

22:38.290 --> 22:40.993
but we have to finish
our date first.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.532
I mean, you asked
me out, I'm here.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.234
It would be rude
not to continue.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.005
Besides, we haven't
even had dessert yet.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.743
- You're insane.

22:56.743 --> 22:57.544
- Am I?

22:58.745 --> 23:01.380
You pursued me online,
if I'm not mistaken.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.552
You ranted about
how beautiful I was.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.219
About how much we had in common.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.491
How I was everything
you were looking for.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.926
Fuck, Richard.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.595
You even talked
to me about kids.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.830
- You asked me what
I thought about kids

23:17.864 --> 23:21.834
and I said I liked them.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.235
- Don't backpedal.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.904
You know what I
was talking about.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.041
- Just because we've been
talking for two weeks,

23:29.075 --> 23:31.210
that does not make
us soul mates.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.412
It takes time to get
to know each other

23:33.412 --> 23:34.781
in order for that to happen.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.050
- No, that's not
what you said online.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.253
You said there was no
time limit on love.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.922
- People say a lot of things

23:42.922 --> 23:44.924
when they're getting
to know each other.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.192
- [Renee] So you
were lying to me?

23:46.225 --> 23:48.461
- No, I'm not saying that.

23:48.461 --> 23:49.462
- [Renee] Then what
are you saying.

23:49.462 --> 23:50.429
- I'm saying...

23:52.599 --> 23:55.101
I'm saying that sometimes

23:55.101 --> 23:57.103
when you're getting
to know someone new

23:57.103 --> 23:58.270
that you want to impress

23:59.472 --> 24:03.275
you say some things
that may not be untrue

24:04.143 --> 24:06.613
but, they might be exaggerated

24:06.613 --> 24:08.280
in order to appear
more important.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.450
- I don't.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.384
- Everybody does.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.786
It's not a slight against you.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.255
- That's all fine and dandy

24:16.255 --> 24:17.824
but I'm telling you, I don't.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.062
- All right.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.764
How bout this then?

24:24.764 --> 24:26.232
You murdered that waitress.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.635
- She had it coming.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.069
She was a fucking cunt.

24:30.436 --> 24:33.439
- You also said the
most important part

24:33.472 --> 24:37.443
of your life was your
relationship with God.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.312
How can you possibly have
a relationship with God

24:40.312 --> 24:43.182
when you have no
problem breaking one
of his commandments?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.252
A big one.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.755
(tense music)

24:53.459 --> 24:56.328
(Richard shouting)

24:57.797 --> 24:59.866
- How dare you question
my relationship with God,

24:59.866 --> 25:01.133
you son of a bitch?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.435
My faith in God runs
deeper than anything

25:03.435 --> 25:06.138
your pathetic life has
ever had to endure.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.347
Maybe you should
just keep in mind

25:15.347 --> 25:17.516
that it was my
relationship with God

25:17.516 --> 25:19.686
that brought us together
in the first place.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.155
He brought us together

25:23.189 --> 25:25.658
as a reward for my loyalty.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.397
Something to think about,
huh mister fucking spiritual?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.069
(woman sighing)

25:48.380 --> 25:50.983
Oh my God.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.856
(eerie tense music)

26:02.228 --> 26:04.263
She's an angel.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.065
An angel sent
straight from heaven.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.601
What's your name, beautiful?

26:09.836 --> 26:10.770
- Her name is--

26:10.770 --> 26:12.104
- I didn't ask you, bitch.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.107
- It's okay, baby.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.279
- Sophia.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.113
- Sophia.

26:22.548 --> 26:26.385
That's a beautiful name for
a beautiful little girl.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.954
How old are you, Sophia?

26:28.855 --> 26:29.689
- Eight.

26:30.556 --> 26:32.892
- Wow, eight.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.426
You're a big girl, aren't you?

26:36.062 --> 26:37.630
Do you believe in Jesus, Sophia?

26:40.733 --> 26:42.902
Young lady, an adult
asked you a question.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.207
- Yes.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.944
- That's good.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.145
That's really good.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.983
Because you're gonna
get to meet him tonight,

26:57.049 --> 26:57.884
real soon.

26:59.986 --> 27:00.753
- Hey!

27:02.288 --> 27:04.991
I don't know who the
fuck you think you are.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.093
Getting a little tired
of this horseshit.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.964
Look, I'm sorry you can't
find a fella to fit the bill.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.065
Life sucks.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.503
That aint that
little girl's fault.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.438
It's none of our fault.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.008
You're already in
over your head here.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.110
Why don't you put that gun down

27:24.143 --> 27:25.511
and just stop this nonsense?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.148
(tense music)

27:32.018 --> 27:33.585
Come on now, sugar.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.323
(gunshot)

27:42.995 --> 27:44.997
(woman shouts)

27:44.997 --> 27:47.133
- Shut the fuck up!

27:47.166 --> 27:48.835
Everybody shut the fuck up now!

27:50.169 --> 27:52.338
I want you all to
take a good long look

27:52.338 --> 27:53.840
at mister tough guy over there.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.841
(man gurgling)

27:54.874 --> 27:55.708
Look at him.

27:58.778 --> 27:59.979
Now look at Richard here.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.482
Remember his face.

28:04.817 --> 28:08.020
Etch in your brains.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.524
Because he's the reason you
all are going to die tonight.

28:13.893 --> 28:17.296
He's the reason you'll never
see your families again.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.365
- Renee, this is absurd.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.199
(Richard grunting)

28:20.199 --> 28:21.033
- Is it?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.303
You brought this
hell on yourself.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.405
Your lies and deception

28:26.405 --> 28:29.175
are what put you
in this position.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.477
- But I didn't do anything.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.146
- Yes, you did.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.682
Yes, you did.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.351
And now you're
going to pay for it.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.222
These acts can't go unpunished.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.824
You can't lie to people.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.760
Not about love.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.763
Especially not about love.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.834
- But I didn't lie.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.504
I do love you.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.440
(eerie tense music)

29:02.741 --> 29:03.609
- What you say?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.248
- I meant what I said.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.084
I do love you.

29:13.719 --> 29:14.887
I was just afraid.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.890
Afraid of being hurt again.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.193
Hell, maybe I was
afraid of being happy.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.061
I don't know.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.197
But you've shown me, Renee.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.601
You've shown me that if
someone can be as passionate

29:29.601 --> 29:30.870
about love as you are,

29:33.039 --> 29:34.640
maybe it's worth
taking a chance.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.954
(Richard shouting)

29:50.957 --> 29:53.993
Is it okay if I hold
you, sweetheart?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.628
- Of course it is.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.499
(eerie tense music)

30:06.072 --> 30:06.973
You see?

30:06.973 --> 30:08.807
You see how wonderful this is?

30:10.742 --> 30:13.745
(eerie tense music)

30:31.964 --> 30:34.700
(dramatic music)

30:36.368 --> 30:38.504
(gunshot)

30:39.671 --> 30:41.340
You asshole.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.376
You stupid stupid asshole.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.213
I would of given you anything.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.547
You could of had everything.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.217
But that's all over now.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.484
How does it feel to know

30:52.518 --> 30:54.386
that last thing you
did with your life

30:54.386 --> 30:56.555
was kill a room full
of innocent people

30:56.622 --> 30:58.290
all because you were too stupid

30:58.324 --> 30:59.858
to recognize the best thing

30:59.858 --> 31:00.993
that ever happened to you.

31:02.028 --> 31:02.861
You're fucked.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.034
(gunshot)

31:08.034 --> 31:10.536
(tense music)

31:22.881 --> 31:25.551
(heart beating)

31:34.726 --> 31:37.096
- Relax, try not to move.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.168
Now, this might
sting for a second.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.107
- Where's Renee?

31:50.676 --> 31:51.743
- She didn't make it.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.548
- I don't know what happened.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.784
- It's okay.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.286
We do.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.120
Just take it easy.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.723
- Thank you so much.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.059
- Trust me.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.596
There's no need to
thank me at all.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.599
Hell, I'm not even a paramedic.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.404
- What?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.306
- The names Jeremy, by the way.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.607
I hope she mentioned me.

32:23.609 --> 32:24.810
- What?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.812
- She was truly
one of a kind, man.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.916
She was everything to me.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.654
And you took her from me.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.891
Now that can't go unpunished.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.662
But don't you worry.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.065
It will all be over soon.

32:46.999 --> 32:50.169
(eerie tense music)

32:50.236 --> 32:51.737
Night night.

32:51.737 --> 32:54.173
(tense music)

33:01.780 --> 33:02.681
- Wow.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.815
You sure do know to pick 'em,

33:03.815 --> 33:05.017
don't you, Rick?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.752
- Do you understand now?

33:06.785 --> 33:09.455
I didn't do anything wrong.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.623
I mean, hell, I'm
the victim here.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.492
- It's funny, now
that I think of it.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.662
I remember meeting your
girl Renee down here

33:16.662 --> 33:17.463
not too long ago.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.830
She was nice.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.500
You know, a little bit
on the dramatic side.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.002
We love getting those religious
types down here, though.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.638
The boss really considers
it a personal win.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.808
- So can I go?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.110
- It's such a tragedy.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.812
I mean all you wanted to
do was meet a nice girl,

33:33.845 --> 33:36.348
maybe get a little
bit of strange

33:36.348 --> 33:37.849
and you had to die over it, man.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.485
Am I right?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.453
- Can I go?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.289
- Just one more
question, if I could.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.658
As far as your
death was concerned,

33:47.025 --> 33:48.327
how did Marcy take it?

33:50.229 --> 33:51.697
- Excuse me?

33:51.697 --> 33:53.199
- You know, Marcy.

33:54.066 --> 33:54.900
Your wife.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.339
It says here you two
would have celebrated

34:00.339 --> 34:02.708
your 13 year anniversary
this September.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.146
It's such a shame,

34:07.179 --> 34:09.014
especially with
having kids so young.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.250
I'm sure she totally understood

34:11.317 --> 34:12.684
about the whole
Renee thing, though.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.754
After all, she did
support you for two years

34:15.754 --> 34:18.190
while you worked on your
novel you never finished

34:18.224 --> 34:20.391
with that harlequin
with the nicely

34:20.391 --> 34:21.360
oiled up man on the cover.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.194
- Look.

34:23.661 --> 34:28.033
I may not have been the
most faithful husband

34:29.235 --> 34:31.770
but that doesn't make
me a horrible person.
I mean ...

34:32.070 --> 34:34.039
is infidelity
even really a sin?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.241
- Oh who could tell anymore?

34:35.241 --> 34:37.409
I mean the rules change
from week to week.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.545
I will tell you this, though.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.514
Habitual cheating, not
a very nice thing to do.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.351
You know something, I
think you're gonna fit in

34:45.351 --> 34:46.518
down here just fine.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.121
I tell ya what, though.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.190
I'd be more than happy
to pull a couple strings

34:52.224 --> 34:53.458
to make sure you and Renee

34:53.458 --> 34:56.262
get to spend a little
quality time together.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.964
After all, you're
soulmates, right?

35:03.702 --> 35:06.205
(eerie music)

35:09.375 --> 35:10.209
Bye bye.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.381
All right, Lilith,
can you please bring

35:15.381 --> 35:16.548
in our next contestant?

35:17.816 --> 35:18.750
(Lilith sighing)

35:18.784 --> 35:19.651
- [Lilith] On the way, Gregory.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.590
- Thank you so much.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.791
I appreciate it.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.494
All right.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.631
So, Mr. Justin Parker, right?

35:33.665 --> 35:34.666
- Yeah.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.667
- Well, young man.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.336
My name is Gregory Asmodeus

35:37.336 --> 35:39.971
and I'll be serving as
counsel for your case.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.741
I take it our welcome committee

35:42.741 --> 35:44.943
has brought you up to speed?

35:44.976 --> 35:45.811
- No.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.279
- That's all right.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.248
So you can pretty much think
of me as your attorney.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.582
The opposing attorney,

35:52.418 --> 35:55.254
the judge, and the executioner.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.792
But seriously, you got
nothing to worry about.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.994
We already know you're guilty.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.763
Just a matter of
trying to figure out

36:04.796 --> 36:06.298
where you fit into our
little company here.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.333
You know what I mean?

36:09.635 --> 36:11.937
- No, I don't.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.205
What am I guilty of?

36:13.205 --> 36:14.340
- All in due time.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.175
For now, why don't we talk about

36:17.175 --> 36:19.211
what brought you here
in the first place?

36:21.380 --> 36:22.614
- What brought me here
in the first place?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.115
I don't even know
how I got here.

36:24.115 --> 36:27.853
- Now, everybody's experience
is a little bit different.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.555
Why do you say we go
over your file here

36:29.621 --> 36:32.224
and see if we can't
sort this out together.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.559
That sound good?

36:46.972 --> 36:49.641
(phone ringing)

37:00.151 --> 37:01.687
- Hello?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.188
- Hey, baby.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.523
It's me.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.857
We need to talk.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.861
Do me a favor, meet me
at the barn where we met.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.664
I'll tell you about it then.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.366
- That sounds kinda sketchy.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.002
- You have to trust
me on this one, okay,

37:17.002 --> 37:17.936
just meet me there.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.040
- [Iris] Okay, just
give me a half hour.

37:22.040 --> 37:22.874
- Okay.

37:23.775 --> 37:24.676
I'll see you soon.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.895
(suspenseful electronic music)

37:55.407 --> 37:56.241
- Justin?

37:59.110 --> 37:59.945
Justin?

38:00.779 --> 38:04.616
(suspenseful electronic music)

39:12.183 --> 39:14.119
(Iris gasping)

39:14.152 --> 39:17.155
(eerie tense music)

39:25.296 --> 39:27.966
(Iris gurgling)

39:32.203 --> 39:34.873
(Iris coughing)

39:40.579 --> 39:41.413
- Iris?

39:44.349 --> 39:45.183
Iris?

39:51.490 --> 39:54.993
(eerie suspenseful music)

40:02.668 --> 40:05.170
(tense music)

40:43.975 --> 40:45.711
- [Justin] Okay, you ready?

40:45.744 --> 40:46.545
- [Brittany] Yup.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.314
- [Justin] We can turn around.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.316
You can back out right now.

40:51.316 --> 40:52.651
I'm not gonna judge you.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.220
- [Brittany] Why would
I want to do that?

40:55.253 --> 40:57.255
- It's just been awhile

40:57.288 --> 40:59.257
since I brought anyone
home to meet her.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.160
- I'm really
excited to meet her.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.895
- I'm glad you are,
'cause I'm not.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.133
Just don't say I
didn't warn you, okay?

41:22.180 --> 41:25.116
(doorbell ringing)

41:26.652 --> 41:27.653
- Justin.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.420
Oh baby.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.288
- Hey, Mom.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.657
- Oh you made it.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.193
Oh, baby.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.261
It's so good to see you.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.663
- Good to see you, too, Mom.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.800
- And this must be
darling Brittany.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.135
- It's really nice to
meet you, Mrs. Parker.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.974
- Oh it's Ms. Parker,
unfortunately.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.812
Why don't you come in?

42:08.727 --> 42:10.128
So.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.365
Justin told me you
two met at school.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.834
- Yup.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.904
We were in the same dorms,
just different halls.

42:18.904 --> 42:21.239
We ran right into each other.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.209
- Literally, ran
right into each other.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.477
Our textbooks went
flying everywhere.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.013
We knocked Wilson's coffee over.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.047
- Oh yeah.

42:30.816 --> 42:31.983
- That's sweet.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.720
So, what it was
love at first crash?

42:35.721 --> 42:38.023
- I guess you could say that.

42:38.023 --> 42:41.359
There was just
something about him.

42:45.163 --> 42:46.497
- There certainly is.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.671
Isn't that sweet?

42:58.744 --> 43:01.346
- So, if you don't
mind me asking,

43:02.413 --> 43:04.249
how long has Justin's
dad been gone?

43:06.852 --> 43:08.453
- That's a personal question.

43:11.957 --> 43:15.293
A lady doesn't ask another
lady a personal question

43:15.293 --> 43:16.561
like that, does she?

43:18.263 --> 43:19.097
- I am so sorry.

43:19.097 --> 43:19.931
You're right.

43:19.931 --> 43:20.766
I'll change the subject.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.703
- No, it's fine.

43:24.736 --> 43:25.570
I'll answer.

43:28.373 --> 43:32.543
Justin's father was
murdered 10 years ago

43:32.543 --> 43:33.979
in a serial killing spree.

43:39.050 --> 43:41.720
- Oh my God, that's horrible.

43:46.157 --> 43:46.992
- Yes.

43:47.993 --> 43:48.794
It was.

43:52.097 --> 43:55.967
And ever since that night
I've done everything I can

43:55.967 --> 43:59.805
to make sure my little
boy is taken care of.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.275
- You sound like an amazing mom.

44:06.444 --> 44:07.913
- Thank you.

44:07.913 --> 44:08.947
Oh, Justin.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.817
Think I'm starting
to like this one.

44:14.585 --> 44:15.754
- What, have you had any trouble

44:15.754 --> 44:17.288
with any of his
previous girlfriends?

44:18.656 --> 44:19.691
- Well, you know.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.761
A mother and her only child.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.664
The love, the expectations.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.701
No one can live up.

44:44.816 --> 44:47.352
(bell ringing)

44:50.355 --> 44:51.556
Dinner's ready.

44:56.694 --> 44:57.695
- Thank God.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.031
You okay?

45:01.066 --> 45:02.133
- Yes.

45:02.167 --> 45:03.001
Stop freaking out.

45:03.001 --> 45:03.835
Everything is great.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.738
- Just got to make sure.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.574
My mom can be a
little intimidating.

45:10.508 --> 45:12.177
- She's a big sweetheart.

45:12.177 --> 45:15.013
Especially compared to
my last boyfriend's mom.

45:15.013 --> 45:15.847
- Really?

45:15.847 --> 45:16.681
- Oh yeah.

45:18.016 --> 45:19.017
- Okay, good.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.552
Come on, let's go eat.

45:21.552 --> 45:22.754
My moms a hell of a cook.

45:26.191 --> 45:28.359
- Thank you so much
for dinner, Ms. Parker.

45:28.359 --> 45:29.861
Everything was delicious.

45:31.062 --> 45:31.897
- Sure.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.200
- So.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.568
What was Justin like as a kid?

45:39.170 --> 45:42.874
- He was a little trouble maker.

45:42.908 --> 45:43.909
- I'll bet he was.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.111
- Come on, Mom.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.278
Can we please not
talk about that?

45:48.579 --> 45:50.448
- She brought it up.

45:50.448 --> 45:54.019
- Yeah, I'd like to
know more about him.

45:54.052 --> 45:56.421
How was he with the ladies?

45:56.421 --> 45:58.689
- He was very popular.

46:00.291 --> 46:03.761
He had like four
girlfriends in high school.

46:05.030 --> 46:05.864
- Just four?

46:07.365 --> 46:10.601
- He was a very serious dater.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.870
When he was with someone,

46:11.903 --> 46:13.138
he'd be with them
for about a year.

46:14.139 --> 46:15.373
- Then what would happen?

46:17.442 --> 46:18.643
- They'd break his heart.

46:21.579 --> 46:22.413
- Oh.

46:23.748 --> 46:25.750
I'm sorry to hear that.

46:33.959 --> 46:36.561
- Can we please talk about
something else, anything?

46:38.229 --> 46:40.265
- Actually, may I be excused?

46:40.298 --> 46:42.467
I need to use the restroom.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.303
- It's right down the hall,

46:45.303 --> 46:47.305
second door on the left.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.139
- Thank you.

46:56.147 --> 46:56.982
- What?

46:58.917 --> 47:00.251
What's wrong with this one?

47:03.621 --> 47:04.990
- Do you want me to be honest?

47:06.657 --> 47:08.193
I think she's a little fake.

47:08.193 --> 47:09.260
- A little fake?

47:09.294 --> 47:10.195
- Yeah.

47:10.195 --> 47:11.997
- You said she was a sweetheart.

47:11.997 --> 47:13.098
- I can be fake, too.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.667
- Here we go, once again.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.037
No one is ever gonna be good
enough for you, are they?

47:19.037 --> 47:19.837
- No.

47:20.972 --> 47:21.873
No.

47:21.873 --> 47:23.174
Of course they aren't, baby.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.679
(phone vibrating)

47:28.679 --> 47:30.115
- Shit, Christ, it's work.

47:30.115 --> 47:31.282
I gotta take this.

47:32.984 --> 47:35.020
- Why don't you go
ahead and run outside

47:35.020 --> 47:36.521
so you can have some privacy.

47:59.810 --> 48:01.046
- Where's Justin?

48:03.314 --> 48:04.715
- He went outside

48:06.817 --> 48:07.885
to take a work call.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.100
- Dinner really was great.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.534
Thank you again so much.

48:24.402 --> 48:25.236
- Sure.

48:36.181 --> 48:39.350
- Can I ask you something?

48:41.786 --> 48:42.620
- Sure.

48:44.689 --> 48:47.358
- How can you hate me when
you don't even know me?

48:51.796 --> 48:52.730
- I never said.

48:56.767 --> 48:57.969
I never said I hated you.

49:01.139 --> 49:02.907
- You didn't have to.

49:16.054 --> 49:19.457
(tense electronic music)

49:27.598 --> 49:28.466
- Brittany.

49:30.301 --> 49:34.505
My son and I share
a special bond.

49:37.675 --> 49:39.444
I would do anything for him.

49:40.611 --> 49:43.614
(eerie tense music)

49:45.583 --> 49:48.319
(girl screaming)

49:53.791 --> 49:57.462
And over the years
I have seen a parade

49:57.462 --> 50:00.798
of young women walking
through that door

50:00.831 --> 50:03.368
vying for my son's attention.

50:03.368 --> 50:06.371
(eerie tense music)

50:21.519 --> 50:24.822
Do you want to know
what every single one

50:24.822 --> 50:26.824
of those girls had in common?

50:28.659 --> 50:30.461
- What?

50:30.461 --> 50:33.464
(eerie tense music)

50:35.700 --> 50:39.204
(chainsaw revving)

50:39.237 --> 50:41.972
(girl screaming)

50:48.379 --> 50:49.714
- They all disappeared.

50:50.915 --> 50:53.084
Leaving him heartbroken.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.988
I've seen my son's heart
broken too many times

50:58.022 --> 51:00.825
to just blindly accept
anyone who walks in his life.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.735
- I completely understand
where you're coming from.

51:12.036 --> 51:15.106
I'm telling you
that I love your son

51:15.106 --> 51:16.507
with all my heart.

51:17.875 --> 51:21.011
I've never met anyone like him.

51:23.013 --> 51:26.050
I want to spend every
waking minute with him.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.688
He's all I ever think about.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.962
It's important to me
that you trust me.

51:40.631 --> 51:41.466
- Trust.

51:44.769 --> 51:45.570
Okay.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.590
You want me to trust you?

52:08.125 --> 52:08.959
Fine.

52:10.428 --> 52:11.262
Let's test that.

52:13.631 --> 52:14.932
You brought it up earlier.

52:16.401 --> 52:19.470
You really want to know what
happened to Justin's father?

52:21.639 --> 52:22.507
- [Brittany] Okay.

52:25.310 --> 52:28.646
- [Priscilla] Would you consider
yourself a religious woman?

52:29.814 --> 52:34.018
- I wouldn't consider
myself religious, no.

52:34.084 --> 52:35.253
Spiritual, maybe.

52:36.454 --> 52:38.155
I'm embarrassed to admit
I'm a bit too ignorant

52:38.155 --> 52:40.157
on the subject to
consider myself religious.

52:40.858 --> 52:41.826
I mean...

52:42.026 --> 52:45.095
I do believe there's some sort
of higher power, I just...

52:45.430 --> 52:46.964
don't know
what that would be.

52:48.999 --> 52:49.834
- Right, well.

52:52.270 --> 52:57.208
When I was young, I had
the same mindset as you.

52:59.043 --> 53:00.211
I was lost.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.482
I felt confused.

53:06.884 --> 53:07.718
Alone.

53:10.154 --> 53:12.557
Until I found a group of people

53:14.058 --> 53:15.660
that felt just like me.

53:21.366 --> 53:22.967
And I was so naive.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.036
I was with them for
almost two months.

53:27.472 --> 53:28.906
Before I realized,

53:30.675 --> 53:32.477
I joined a satanic cult.

53:32.477 --> 53:35.179
(fire whooshing)

53:36.146 --> 53:37.248
And the funny thing is,

53:39.817 --> 53:41.886
even after I figured it out,

53:44.322 --> 53:45.356
I stayed.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.395
They were like family to me.

53:54.499 --> 53:58.669
Until, the night
it was announced

53:58.703 --> 54:03.107
that we were all to sacrifice
ourselves to Lucifer,

54:04.575 --> 54:05.943
to prove our devotion.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.048
So I escaped

54:12.717 --> 54:17.622
to the sound of my
brothers and sisters

54:17.622 --> 54:19.123
killing themselves.

54:19.189 --> 54:20.858
(man screaming)
(flames crackling)

54:20.891 --> 54:21.726
And each other.

54:26.096 --> 54:30.100
- [Brittany] Oh my God,
that's, that's horrible.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.202
- And the sad thing

54:34.439 --> 54:37.107
is I probably would
of joined them

54:39.243 --> 54:43.581
if it weren't for
one little thing.

54:46.551 --> 54:48.052
I was pregnant with Justin.

54:49.219 --> 54:50.555
Two months.

54:53.558 --> 54:58.396
So I may not of
had the self esteem

54:58.429 --> 55:00.097
to care about my life.

55:01.766 --> 55:03.934
But my son's life
meant the world to me.

55:06.804 --> 55:07.805
So I left.

55:09.407 --> 55:13.077
And I found my family,
my real family,

55:14.311 --> 55:16.581
and they helped me
with my pregnancy.

55:22.987 --> 55:23.921
And later on,

55:25.155 --> 55:26.156
the police,

55:27.992 --> 55:30.495
they told me that
the other members

55:32.363 --> 55:33.964
hadn't killed themselves.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.435
They were murdered.

55:42.673 --> 55:46.377
So when Justin got old
enough to understand

55:46.444 --> 55:49.480
and ask me about his father,

55:52.182 --> 55:53.684
I never lied.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.555
I just omitted some facts.

56:01.526 --> 56:04.729
You see, my son's life
means everything to me.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.067
And if I didn't have him,

56:11.201 --> 56:12.737
I'd have no reason to go on.

56:16.707 --> 56:17.542
- I'm so sorry.

56:18.643 --> 56:19.677
- Don't be.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.913
If I hadn't gone
through that ordeal,

56:22.913 --> 56:25.382
I never would have
my wonderful son.

56:29.219 --> 56:33.357
But you understand, he
can never know that.

56:35.359 --> 56:36.761
Okay?

56:36.761 --> 56:38.663
He has closure now.

56:40.898 --> 56:45.903
- I, I understand.

57:07.592 --> 57:09.627
- [Priscilla] Get that.

57:09.627 --> 57:10.461
- Okay.

57:16.100 --> 57:16.934
- Go on.

57:33.117 --> 57:36.286
- Look, Ms. Parker.

57:36.286 --> 57:39.490
I completely understand
why you're apprehensive

57:39.557 --> 57:41.058
about trusting me

57:41.058 --> 57:43.928
especially after everything
you've also gone through.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.065
I can't even begin to imagine.

57:49.466 --> 57:54.138
But I need you to know that
I really do love Justin.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.175
All I want to do
is make him happy.

58:00.310 --> 58:02.647
You're the most important
person in his life.

58:04.114 --> 58:07.451
It's important to me
that we get along.

58:07.451 --> 58:10.454
(eerie tense music)

58:29.874 --> 58:34.879
(wet crunching)
(Brittany gasping)

58:46.323 --> 58:49.326
(eerie tense music)

59:01.405 --> 59:04.341
(demonic coughing)

59:09.647 --> 59:12.817
(distorted) So, what
gave me away this time?

59:14.018 --> 59:16.553
- Your reflection in the
mirror gave you away.

59:22.059 --> 59:25.062
(eerie tense music)

59:25.062 --> 59:28.733
- (distorted) Oh shit.

59:28.733 --> 59:31.568
That's not the first time
I've forgotten that one.

59:31.602 --> 59:33.203
- You about ready to give up?

59:35.339 --> 59:37.708
- (distorted) Not a chance.

59:37.742 --> 59:38.909
I'm just warming up.

59:41.045 --> 59:44.048
What was up with that bullshit
story you told in there?

59:45.449 --> 59:48.619
I seem to remember things
going a bit differently.

59:48.686 --> 59:51.355
- That kind of truth
is better left lost.

59:53.257 --> 59:54.725
- (distorted) You killed
the members of your cult

59:54.759 --> 59:57.594
because you wanted my
power all to yourself.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:02.532
- Oh, I murdered them
because you possessed them.

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:06.370
- (distorted) Just like a woman.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.938
Aways someone else's fault.

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.875
Never your own.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.244
- You know I'm never
gonna let you have him.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.113
- (distorted) He's our son.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.884
A boy deserves to
know his father.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:24.121
- Just because you had a
hand in his conception.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.923
(distorted laughing)

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.258
- (distorted) A hand?

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:31.495
I seem to remember a dick and
a tongue in there as well.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:38.068
I also seem to remember
you liking it quite a bit.

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:40.004
- Oh, why do you
have to be so vulgar?

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:42.673
- (distorted) I'm the devil,

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.009
what the fuck did you expect?

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:48.178
- In any event, I'm not
gonna let you have him.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:50.147
So please let him go.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.648
I'll do anything.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.084
Take me instead.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.353
- (distorted) The only
thing I needed from you

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:58.422
ended a long time ago.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:01.591
What I need now is Justin.

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.095
You know it's the only way
I can return to the flesh

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:11.501
besides, I can't take you or
even kill you for that matter.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.604
It's part of the
arrangement you made

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:16.373
when you summoned me
all those years ago.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.044
- And how many bimbos
are you going to inhabit

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:22.046
that I have to destroy

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.214
in order for you to understand

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.051
I am never going
to let that happen?

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.821
- (distorted) As
many as it takes.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:33.891
Once he impregnates just one,

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:38.195
I can be reborn and rule the
world that is rightfully mine.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.865
- At the expense
of our son's life.

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:47.704
- (distorted) Well,
no plan is perfect.

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:52.076
It's called acceptable lost.

01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:53.377
- No.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.812
It's over.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.981
You've lost, you're done.

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.918
- (distorted) Oh
it's far from over.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.255
This has been a
long time coming.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.825
You can't protect him forever.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:11.661
- Yes, I can.

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:14.031
I'm his mother.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.233
It's what we do.

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:25.275
(wet crunching)

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.285
- [Justin] Hey, Mom, what's up?

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:36.520
Where's Brittany?

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:38.188
- Oh, babe.

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:40.390
She had to leave.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.526
But she told me to
say goodbye to you.

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.966
- Look, Mom, I don't
want to fight you, okay.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.935
I just want you to trust
my judgment once in awhile,

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:51.701
that's it.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:55.639
Just because I have someone
in my life that's not you

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:56.907
that I care about

01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.608
it doesn't mean that I'm
trying to replace you.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.110
No one can ever replace you.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.112
You're my mom.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:05.115
I'll always be here for you.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.717
- Oh I know, honey.

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:08.585
Thank you.

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:14.458
Sometimes, it's
just hard to let go.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:21.298
(knocking at door)

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:31.608
- Hi, sorry to bother you but
some friends dropped me off

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:32.809
and I'm a little lost.

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:36.480
I'm looking for a party
on Thorten street.

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:38.582
- Yeah Thorten.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.584
It's about five
blocks up that way.

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:41.919
- Hey, is there any
chance you'd be willing

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.020
to show me the way?

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:44.955
- I certainly would.

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:46.490
Let me just grab my keys.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.825
- No, I'm running
out to the store.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.427
I'll take you.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.597
- Really, this late you
need to go to the store?

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:56.433
- Baby, you know
I keep odd hours.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:03.007
- Okay, well, have
fun and be safe.

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:04.441
It was really nice meeting you.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:05.542
- Donna.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.511
- Donna, very nice to meet you.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.980
Take care, hope you find
your party all right.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.521
- Nice try.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.329
(eerie tense music)

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:28.832
- (distorted) Go to hell.

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.801
- So you see, dear Justin.

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.238
Your mother was a real
Ellen Ripely type.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.474
- Who?

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:38.976
- You know, Ellen Ripley.

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:40.911
Aliens.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.981
Game over, man.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.251
Not a sci fi fan?

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:49.686
Nevermind.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.421
Okay, the point is
that your mother

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.157
was keeping quite the dirty
little secret from you.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.926
One she was keeping
your entire life.

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:58.262
- That's crazy, that's not true.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:04:59.763
- No, I'm afraid it's true.

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.765
You happen to remember
what happened next?

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.573
(eerie tense music)

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.180
(wet crunching)

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:38.102
(eerie tense music)

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.617
(wet crunching)

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.288
(eerie tense music)

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:15.505
(Justin gasping)

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:24.948
- I...

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.186
I killed her.

01:06:29.253 --> 01:06:30.420
- Yeah, you did.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.089
- Killed my mother.

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.424
- It was a real Scooby
Doo ending, too.

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:35.825
She would of gotten away for it

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.494
if it wouldn't for
a meddling kid.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.363
Yeah?

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:40.697
Hey, hey Justin, you got a dog?

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:44.434
Sadly, that's not
where the story ends.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.136
Apparently, you
were so distraught

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.937
over the death of mommy dearest,

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:50.940
you took a header off the
roof of the family home.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.943
Normally, I love a good
murder suicide like that,

01:06:53.977 --> 01:06:55.145
you know, but.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.148
When it comes to
situations like that,

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.883
my boss was
definitely not amused.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:06.690
Anybody there, hello?

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.393
Hello?

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.528
Well as fascinating as
this conversation was,

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.497
I'm gonna have to ask
you to take a seat

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.465
in our spacious
waiting room out there.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:18.868
Just let me work
my magic, Justin,

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.870
and it's gonna be fine.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.206
Okay, it's gonna be fine.

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:24.074
No worries, yada yada yada.

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:31.381
(eerie dramatic music)

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.216
- I killed her.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.552
I killed my mother....

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.554
- Yeah, you did.

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:46.096
Lilith.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:48.698
Next victim, please.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:02.946
- Somebody mind telling me
what the hells going on here?

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:04.914
- Mr. Simmons, I assume.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.749
- Yeah, that's right.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:06.716
Who the hell are you?

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.618
- Oh, I'm Gregory Asmodeus.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:11.288
I'll be serving as counsel
on your case today.

01:08:11.355 --> 01:08:12.589
- Case?

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.723
What case?

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:14.924
- Exactly.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.126
Why don't we go
over your file here

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:18.027
and see what we
can come up with.

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.296
- All right, what
do you want to know?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.732
- Well, let's take a look here.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.603
So you ran a small advertisement
company with your brother?

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.103
- Yeah, that's right.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:31.975
- And, and I see you write
jingles, that's exciting.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:32.809
- No.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:37.314
I handle the business
end and book the gigs.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.316
Benny writes the jingles.

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.751
- Wait a sec, aren't you Benny?

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:43.752
- No, I'm John.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.787
Benny's brother.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:46.889
- I'm confused.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.158
- Join the fucking club, pal.

01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:51.161
- Okay.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.332
John, why don't you tell
me your side of this.

01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:03.639
(phone ringing)

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.023
- You got me, what's up?

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:21.957
- [John] Benny, baby.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.993
How's my big brother doing?

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.362
- You know, hooking, crooking.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.863
What's going on with you?

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.966
- [John] Just checking in.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:30.834
You okay?

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:31.667
You sound off.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.638
- Yeah, I think I'm coming
down with something.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.139
- [John] Shit.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.041
I need that jingle for Tiger
Brand Coffee by Sunday.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.009
- Johnny, Johnny...

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.679
I have never missed a deadline.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.880
You have no worries, man.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.549
- [John] I'm serious,
no fucking around here.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:48.017
Do you know how hard
it is to sell jingles?

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:48.952
- Fuck man.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.719
You could sell dick to a whore.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.555
It's what you do.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:55.791
You're a salesman, and
you're damn good at it

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:57.327
I, on the other hand,

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:58.795
I write jingles,

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.397
and I'm also very good at it.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:03.567
So how 'bout you stop
busting my balls, okay?

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:05.168
You'll have your
jingle by Sunday.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.736
I guarantee it.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:07.571
- [John] You're
right, no pressure.

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:08.805
Just get it done.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.507
By the way, did you
enjoy my care package?

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:11.875
- What care package?

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:12.709
- [John] Jesus, Benny.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.177
I know you got it.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.079
The tracking number said it
was delivered two days ago.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:17.581
- Hang on.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:26.823
(Benny coughing)

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:31.193
Yup, got it right here.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.262
- [John] Open her up.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.350
- Oh, man.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.420
Oh, thank you so much.

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:58.922
No, I really do appreciate it.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:10:59.789
This is great.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.360
I was starting to run low.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:06.396
- [John] Look inside
the coffee can.

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.237
- Okay.

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:15.539
I don't get it.

01:11:15.539 --> 01:11:18.074
- [John] Dig inside the coffee.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.048
- Oh hello there.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.617
- [John] That is some
of the finest kind bud

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:28.585
you are ever going to smoke.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.818
- Kine bud.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:30.787
- [John] What?

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:31.955
- Kine bud.

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:33.490
Not kind.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.458
K-I-N-E.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:36.893
- [John] I'm pretty
sure it's kind bud.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.094
- Yeah, well if
you thought that,

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:38.995
you'd been wrong.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.966
- [John] Well, I don't give
a damn what you call it.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:43.800
- Yeah don't worry about it.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.968
Everybody fucks that up.

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:47.504
- [John] It's gonna
have you seeing God.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.673
- Well, that's a
pretty tall order.

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.609
Especially since I'm a safe
distance from religious.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:53.943
Spiritual maybe, but.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.412
- [John] Trust me.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.246
This shit can change ya, man.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.815
- Well I do thank you for this

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:01.317
and I will be giving
you my review directly.

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:06.121
- [John] Oh, there's
one more thing

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.991
I wanted to talk to you about.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.192
- Yeah, what's that?

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:10.326
- [John] We're planning
on putting together

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.827
a nice big meal this Sunday

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.430
and well we'd really love

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.630
to have you over.
- John, you know

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.366
I can't do that.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:17.300
- [John] Oh come on, man.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.535
The kids would really love

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:19.636
to see their Uncle
Benny, you know?

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.837
- Great.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.105
Bring 'em by, I'd
love to see them, too.

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:24.674
- [John] The place isn't
exactly kid friendly.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.844
- Look, we've been
over this, man.

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.547
I have agoraphobia.

01:12:30.614 --> 01:12:32.616
I'm not just doing this for fun.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:35.184
It's an anxiety condition.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.553
- [John] Jesus, Benny.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.621
You haven't left that
apartment in 12 fucking years.

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:41.691
- I can't leave the apartment.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:42.859
You know this.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:45.294
Why do you always
have to minimize this?

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:48.498
- [John] You could at least try.

01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:49.466
- What do you want from me?

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:51.535
I can't leave the apartment.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:53.369
It's not an option.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.839
What part of that can't
you get through your head?

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:57.907
- [John] This isn't
healthy, Benny.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.510
This can't be good for you.

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:02.077
- I'm surviving.

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.913
- [John] The only
reason you survive

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.014
is because I take care of you.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:08.418
- Oh am I becoming an
inconvenience for you?

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:09.419
You wanna stop?

01:13:10.654 --> 01:13:11.987
- [John] I didn't
say that, it's just.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.657
- It's just what, John?

01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:17.661
- [John] I'm just
worried about you, Benny.

01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:20.664
- And I appreciate
that, I really do.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:22.165
It's just is what it is.

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.601
- [John] Can you at
least think about it?

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.370
- Yeah, yes, okay.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.438
I'll try.

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.673
I'll think about it.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.174
- [John] Thank you.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.510
Now seriously, I need
that jingle in three days.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.343
You got it?

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:35.178
- I got it, boss.

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:36.079
- [John] Good.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:37.013
Talk to you later, all right?

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:38.548
- All right, take care, man.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:46.755
All right.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.257
Little brother wants a jingle.

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:51.027
Let's give him a jingle.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:54.931
Of course it might be nice

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.766
to have a little herbal
inspiration first.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:00.637
I think it's about time
we give this little lady

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:01.705
her day in court.

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:03.873
I got three days, right?

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.943
(eerie tense music)

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:14.951
* I'm smoking this weed

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.119
* Just lay back

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.120
* Coffee cake Kush
cleaner then a Maytag *

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.121
* Got me tripping

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.121
* Mixed in and just see that

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.089
* Smoke so lacking

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.124
* Nothing but a feed back

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.125
* Say yes I got green

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:22.959
* Yes I got purple

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:23.793
* See me inside

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:24.628
* Smoking that early

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:25.629
* Bitches aint know

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:26.630
* Nothing 'bout this

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.597
* Smoking that gas

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.598
* Got a motherfucker twist

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:30.734
* Rolling up that Backwood

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:32.101
* Stuff it full of purp

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.003
* Tell 'em what's good

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:38.273
* We got pounds of
that herb bitch *

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:53.923
This is definitely not kine bud.

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.264
I'm not even sure this is pot.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:03.967
Somebody got ripped off.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:17.513
* Tiger Brand Coffee

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:21.618
* It always does the trick

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:33.730
* Tiger Brand Coffee

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:38.802
* It always does the trick

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:40.904
* And if you don't like it

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:44.139
* You can suck my dick

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.809
Yeah, I don't think they're
gonna go for that, Benny.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.012
(creature chittering)

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.414
(tense music)

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:52.582
What the fuck?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.386
(tense music)

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:02.091
(creature trilling)

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:11.434
(Benny grunting)

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:15.739
(tense electronic music)

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.630
Jesus Christ, no.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.870
(tense electronic music)

01:16:57.612 --> 01:16:58.447
Help!

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:00.549
Help!

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:01.584
Anybody, I'm in here.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.621
(Benny coughing)

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:07.791
Anybody, help!

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:10.093
Help!

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:18.567
Wait.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:26.309
That's not smoke.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.443
That's weed.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.525
(Benny laughing)

01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:44.093
Kine bud, I get it.

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:48.097
You didn't tell me this shit
creeps up on ya, Johnny.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.132
Nice.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:52.501
(tense electronic music)

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:22.498
Might as well get the full
effect of this bad boy.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:26.469
(psychedelic electronic music)

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.749
(Benny laughing)

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.689
(static crackling)

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.559
(eerie tense music)

01:18:52.996 --> 01:18:55.364
Well, that was a neat ticket.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.775
The gift that keeps on giving.

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:12.248
Man, I could eat a baby's butt

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.850
through a park bench right now.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.834
(tense electronic music)

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:13.142
The fuck?

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:35.331
What the fuck?

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.143
What the fuck?

01:20:58.387 --> 01:20:59.956
Junior, it's Benny.

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:02.225
Listen, man.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:03.692
I need you to call me back.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.061
I gotta talk to you about
this coffee that you sent me.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.565
I don't know, is it
like a special blend

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:12.401
or, I don't know, something
added to it or something?

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.171
I swear, I've never
had coffee like this

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.706
and as you know, I've had
my fair share of coffee.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.143
All right, anyway,
give me a call back

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:20.977
when you get a chance.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.344
Not that important.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.379
All right, take care.

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:30.920
(eerie electronic music)

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:46.002
What the fuck?

01:21:48.071 --> 01:21:49.838
All right just keep
it together, Benny.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.008
We just gonna ride this out.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:52.841
We'll be fine.

01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:01.617
Yeah, that's what we need to do.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.952
We'll just sleep through it.

01:22:20.403 --> 01:22:23.806
(eerie electronic music)

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:53.602
God damn it.

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:16.525
(eerie tense music)

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.536
(Benny groaning)

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.850
No, I'm not falling for
this Poltergeist shit.

01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:48.324
(creature chittering)

01:23:48.324 --> 01:23:50.393
You little motherfucker.

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:53.829
(tense electronic music)

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:07.210
(creature chittering)

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.585
Johnny.

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:18.187
Johnny!

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.088
You gotta help me, man.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.755
It won't stop.

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.990
It just, it won't stop.

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.892
What the fuck was in
that weed you gave me?

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:29.398
(ethereal growling)

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.499
Johnny, Johnny?

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:40.543
(Benny groaning)

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:01.897
(tense electronic music)

01:25:42.405 --> 01:25:45.107
(Benny groaning)

01:25:56.452 --> 01:25:59.121
(phone ringing)

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:03.157
(Benny gurgling)

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:22.311
(phone ringing)

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.849
- Benny, Benny is
everything okay?

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:27.850
You cut out and you
wouldn't pick back up,

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.018
so I tried the business line.

01:26:30.052 --> 01:26:31.019
You sounded pretty upset.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.955
What's going on, are you okay?

01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:34.790
You there?

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.862
Well, listen give me a call
when you get this message.

01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:41.864
You really got me
worried here, man.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.233
If I don't hear
from you by five,

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.635
I'll swing by after work, okay.

01:26:46.635 --> 01:26:47.870
Seriously, call me.

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:54.677
And that's everything.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.478
I'm not saying Benny was a saint

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:58.314
but he sure as shit
didn't do anything

01:26:58.314 --> 01:26:59.815
to end up in a place like this.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.585
Neither did I, for that matter.

01:27:04.253 --> 01:27:06.422
Look, there's gotta be
some kind of mistake.

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:10.693
- Can you, can you
excuse me for one moment?

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:14.530
- Yeah sure, whatever it takes.

01:27:19.335 --> 01:27:22.737
(tense electronic music)

01:27:58.441 --> 01:28:00.776
(soft muzak)

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:26.669
(tense electronic music)

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:34.009
- Gregory.

01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:36.844
Something I can do for you?

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:38.013
- Ah, minion.

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:39.848
Minion, minion, minion.

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:41.450
Minion, I appreciate it, though.

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.353
- It's Midian, Gregory.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:47.590
Donald Midian.

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:51.994
For you, Mr. Midian.

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:54.029
- Okay, Mr. Midian.

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:55.864
Always mess that
up, I apologize.

01:28:55.864 --> 01:28:57.866
But you'll excuse me, though.

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:00.035
I got a meeting
with Mr. Tempter.

01:29:01.103 --> 01:29:02.505
- No, you don't.

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:05.340
- No, no I think he's
gonna want to see this.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.675
- Fine.

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:08.010
Just give this information to me

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.844
and I'll make sure he gets it.

01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.614
- [Gregory] Oh,
I don't think so.

01:29:11.647 --> 01:29:12.848
- Oh, I do think so.

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:15.282
- Okay, seriously.

01:29:15.282 --> 01:29:16.452
What the fucks your
problem with me?

01:29:16.452 --> 01:29:18.120
Why do you hate me so much?

01:29:18.153 --> 01:29:19.154
- Why do I hate you?

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:24.126
You're arrogant,
obnoxious, lazy.

01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:28.731
You have no respect for me
or anybody in this company.

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.067
See, you might have
everyone else fooled

01:29:32.134 --> 01:29:33.201
but you don't fool me.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.171
You might have
convinced Mr. Tempter

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.706
you deserve your position here

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:40.142
but I'm second in command

01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:44.480
and I'm gonna be second in
command until the end of time

01:29:45.748 --> 01:29:47.750
and I'm not someone you
want to make an enemy.

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:51.253
Just something to think about.

01:29:51.318 --> 01:29:52.987
- I'll keep that
under consideration.

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.389
But something for you to
consider, for instance,

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:57.660
would be your breath.

01:29:57.693 --> 01:30:00.094
It smells like every
single one of your teeth

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:03.264
in your head, just took a
giant horrible terrible shit

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:04.833
at the same time.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:08.737
With that said, perhaps I
could throw some gum brands

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:10.573
at ya, so next
time you're at the,

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.841
you know, local convenience
store down here,

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:16.278
you know, Wintercoat,
Forest, Dentyne, Bazooka Joe.

01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:17.746
You know, PupperMints.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.582
But, oh.

01:30:19.615 --> 01:30:21.684
I must be going, Minion.

01:30:22.585 --> 01:30:23.585
I'll see you around.

01:30:32.895 --> 01:30:35.731
(Midian exhaling)

01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:43.472
Hey, how's my favorite
prince of darkness doing?

01:30:43.472 --> 01:30:45.708
- Make it a quick one, Gregory.

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:49.111
Look, I am teeing off
with Kinison in one hour

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.079
and I have to get
to the clubhouse

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:53.115
before all the drinks are gone.

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:54.717
(Tempter shouting)

01:30:54.717 --> 01:30:56.251
- I feel your pain there, sir.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.286
But do me a favor and take
a look at this case file.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:02.257
- What, I'm supposed to
be doing your job now?

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.927
Like I don't have enough
to do around here already?

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:09.097
- I believe you'll
find it of interest.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:19.975
- Oh.

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:22.945
Well, that's not good, is it?

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.616
Okay, now what am
I missing here?

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:29.785
If it's his brother
that bought the farm,

01:31:29.785 --> 01:31:32.087
then what the here
is he doing here?

01:31:32.087 --> 01:31:34.690
- Well, in a delicious
twist of irony,

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.693
Mr. Simmons was involved
in fatal car accident

01:31:37.693 --> 01:31:39.795
while going to go check
up on his brother.

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:44.266
- Son of a.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:47.870
I hate to give our
competition credit,

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:52.340
but that is some dark
fucking shit right there.

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.977
Say what you will but
the big guy upstairs

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.713
has one wicked sense of humor.

01:31:57.713 --> 01:31:59.815
My hats off to him.

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:00.549
Kudos.

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:04.519
- Absolutely, but what do we do?

01:32:05.721 --> 01:32:09.224
- The rules are
very clear, Gregory.

01:32:09.224 --> 01:32:11.860
The case has been
improperly filed

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.832
and it can be proven that
the client is innocent.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:20.235
Well then the
client is released.

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:25.574
The agent who filed the case

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:27.242
is not only terminated

01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:30.478
but he has to take
the client's place.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.016
That's a rare situation.

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:37.419
But it's far from new policy.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.255
- Well, see that's the thing.

01:32:40.322 --> 01:32:41.889
Take a look at the agent number.

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:45.393
- What?

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.897
Agent 23-19.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:49.732
Shit.

01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:53.501
That's Vince Baphomet's
kid, isn't it?

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:54.335
- Yeah.

01:32:55.771 --> 01:33:00.008
- This is exactly why I hate
doing favors for friends.

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.175
- Yeah.

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.244
So what do we do?

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.112
- Well I can't just
fire him, right?

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:07.049
That would ruin poker night.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.952
- Yeah which is why I
brought this directly to you.

01:33:11.853 --> 01:33:14.356
- No one else has seen
this document, correct?

01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:16.458
- Nobody that could
do anything about it.

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.428
(tense music)

01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:23.130
- Well.

01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:29.103
It appears, this just isn't
Mr. Simmon's day, is it?

01:33:31.573 --> 01:33:32.907
(Tempter laughing)

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:34.442
- Read you loud and clear, sir.

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:37.813
Consider it done.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.885
(tense music)
(Tempter laughing)

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.837
(rock music)

01:34:01.837 --> 01:34:02.838
* Step right up

01:34:02.838 --> 01:34:04.005
* Take a peek inside

01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:05.173
* She's a ripping machine

01:34:05.173 --> 01:34:06.474
* There's nothing to hide

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.976
* There's plenty to chose from

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:09.477
* So play your hunch

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.914
* And each one comes with
a body in the trunk *

01:34:11.947 --> 01:34:14.850
* Round and round
and round we go *

01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:17.085
* They cannot follow our show

01:34:17.119 --> 01:34:18.286
* Get by looks

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:19.487
* You can cop a feel

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.956
* While what you buy

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:22.657
* What you can't steal

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:25.693
(heavy metal music)

01:34:25.761 --> 01:34:30.665
* This is what you know

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:32.835
* This what you know

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:35.704
* (guttural singing)

01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:37.940
* This is what you know

01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:40.809
* (guttural singing)

01:34:40.843 --> 01:34:43.378
* This is what you know

01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:46.380
(heavy metal music)

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:05.567
* Actions have consequences

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:09.471
* I'll get what I deserve

01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:12.474
(heavy metal music)

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:20.983
* Actions have consequences

01:35:29.892 --> 01:35:33.395
* There's no sky

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:36.398
(heavy metal music)

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.358
* Step right up

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:04.291
* And take a peek inside

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.260
* She's a killing machine

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.394
* There's nothing to hide

01:36:06.428 --> 01:36:07.896
* There's plenty to chose from

01:36:07.896 --> 01:36:09.364
* So play your hunch

01:36:09.364 --> 01:36:11.967
* And each one comes with
a body in the trunk *

01:36:11.967 --> 01:36:14.769
* Round and round
and round we go *

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:17.305
* They cannot follow our show

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:18.373
* You can go by looks

01:36:18.406 --> 01:36:19.907
* You can cop a feel

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.245
* There's a free one that
comes with every meal *

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:28.282
* (guttural singing)

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:33.555
* I'll get what I deserve

01:36:33.588 --> 01:36:38.593

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:46.300
* Actions have consequences

01:36:48.436 --> 01:36:52.607
* Consequences

01:36:52.607 --> 01:36:57.112
* There's consequences

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:58.146
* Actions

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:02.117
* There's consequences

01:37:02.117 --> 01:37:05.787
* Actions have consequences
