14:14.940 --> 14:18.560
Which explains the almost
complete lack of bio-signs.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.910
In the absence of one army,
what else would they do

14:22.110 --> 14:23.910
but raise another?

14:24.110 --> 14:26.820
Ours.

14:33.390 --> 14:36.140
<i>Crusher to Picard.</i>

14:36.340 --> 14:38.320
<i>Jack's bio-signs are emanating</i>

14:38.520 --> 14:40.670
<i>from a chamber</i>
<i>one level below you.</i>

14:40.870 --> 14:42.710
Past the Unimatrix array,

14:42.910 --> 14:44.800
below the transporter platform.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.370
How could you possibly
know that?

14:46.570 --> 14:48.410
<i>Given what we've learned,</i>

14:48.610 --> 14:51.110
it's entirely plausible
that some piece of you,

14:51.310 --> 14:52.680
some small part

14:52.880 --> 14:54.850
<i>remains compatible</i>
<i>with the hive.</i>

14:55.050 --> 14:58.380
Which is how I know
that the time has come

14:58.580 --> 15:00.430
for us to part ways.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.380
I can no longer be your captain.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.170
I now have to be... a father.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.870
Go find the beacon.

15:11.070 --> 15:14.350
Will, thank you.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.570
I...

15:16.770 --> 15:19.830
It means so much to me.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.880
You know that I know.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.440
Always.

15:28.530 --> 15:30.460
Mr. Worf...

15:30.650 --> 15:32.070
There are two turns of phrase

15:32.270 --> 15:34.940
a Klingon
never admits to knowing.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.630
Defeat...

15:38.540 --> 15:40.370
...and farewell.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.810
We should be going.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.180
Beverly.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.310
Lead me to our son.

15:59.510 --> 16:00.920
I can lead you
to the next level,

16:01.120 --> 16:03.100
but after that,
the interference increases,

16:03.300 --> 16:05.100
<i>and I'm unable</i>
<i>to be more specific</i>

16:05.300 --> 16:07.410
<i>with Jack's location.</i>

16:07.600 --> 16:10.190
Jean-Luc, I...

16:10.390 --> 16:13.110
Beverly,

16:13.310 --> 16:15.590
you thought of Jack
from the beginning,

16:15.790 --> 16:17.720
shielding him from danger.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.280
You did everything right.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.220
<i>BEVERLY [cutting out]:</i>
<i>Jean-Luc? Jean-Luc?</i>

16:41.420 --> 16:42.660
Beverly.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.880
<i>You can... me.</i>

16:45.080 --> 16:47.520
Beverly? Do you read me?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.180
[indistinct, rapid whispering]

16:56.180 --> 16:58.190
Jack?

16:59.190 --> 17:02.720
VOX: To the worlds
of the Federation, hear us.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.990
Your biological and
technological distinctiveness

17:06.190 --> 17:08.120
will contribute to the whole.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.300
Your cultures will evolve
to serve the future.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.990
Peace and prosperity will spread
across the galaxy.

17:15.190 --> 17:17.040
You will be assimilated.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.300
You will exist
in a universe without fear,

17:19.500 --> 17:22.050
a universe without loss,

17:22.240 --> 17:24.870
unbroken, perfect.

17:25.070 --> 17:27.490
Those diseases are of the past.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.840
- Jack? You hear me?
- Concentrate

17:31.040 --> 17:32.100
all firepower.
Command.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.710
- Fire, Fire, fire. Yeah.
- Jack, I'm here.

17:33.910 --> 17:35.490
I'm here to take you...

17:35.690 --> 17:37.660
[female laughing]

17:40.180 --> 17:42.230
[laughing]

17:49.060 --> 17:52.030
Home.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.590
He is home.

17:56.550 --> 17:58.590
[indistinct whispering]

17:59.940 --> 18:01.690
You...

18:01.890 --> 18:04.030
are home.

18:05.690 --> 18:08.270
At last,

18:08.460 --> 18:11.880
Locutus has returned...

18:12.080 --> 18:14.970
to his true family,

18:15.170 --> 18:18.670
to his Collective,

18:18.870 --> 18:20.750
to me.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.080
[alarms blaring]

18:36.280 --> 18:37.810
Commander.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.470
RAFFI:
There's a Federation ship

18:41.670 --> 18:44.300
near a... a Borg cube.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.650
Galaxy class,
registry number

18:46.850 --> 18:48.780
NCC-1701-D.

18:48.980 --> 18:51.040
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

18:54.130 --> 18:55.660
It's Picard.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.180
They're engaging the Borg.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.320
Enterprise D?

18:59.520 --> 19:00.880
What's left
of that thing is ancient.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.360
It's not tied
to the new system, which means

19:02.560 --> 19:04.020
it can't be controlled
like the rest of us.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.580
All right, we need
to find a way to do the same.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.410
If they're making a play to shut
down the Collective system,

19:08.610 --> 19:11.150
we've got to buy as much time
as we can for 'em to do it.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.110
So how can we break
from the automation?

19:13.310 --> 19:15.110
Fleet Formation is using a kind

19:15.310 --> 19:17.120
of line-of-sight propagation.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.860
In other words...

19:19.060 --> 19:20.640
If they can't see us,
they can't control us.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.300
- On it.
- Tactical,
upload every prefix code

19:23.500 --> 19:24.950
we have for the entire fleet.

19:25.150 --> 19:27.470
- Scramble their shields.
- Uploading and transmitting now.

19:27.670 --> 19:30.090
SEVEN OF NINE:
We can't fire while cloaked,
so we'll have to do this fast.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.090
Us?

19:32.290 --> 19:34.210
Against the entire fleet?

19:44.400 --> 19:47.970
I'm not asking you
to give your lives for nothing.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.410
I'm asking you to fight

19:49.610 --> 19:52.110
for what's below.

19:52.310 --> 19:55.020
Your families, your children.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.720
The Borg have taken our crew,

19:57.920 --> 20:00.160
taken our captain.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.250
But in this moment,
here and now,

20:03.450 --> 20:06.460
we are all
that is left of Starfleet.

20:09.070 --> 20:11.120
It's up to us.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.340
Cloaking device
on line, Captain.

20:18.820 --> 20:21.520
Engage.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.360
- What have you done to him?!
- What could I do?

20:30.560 --> 20:32.970
- I have only my words.
- We are the future.

20:33.170 --> 20:36.850
And the soft assurances
of a mother's love.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.850
You are not his mother!

20:40.050 --> 20:42.370
[laughing]

20:43.370 --> 20:45.340
Until recently,

20:45.530 --> 20:47.690
there was no Collective left.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.860
There was only I.

20:50.060 --> 20:52.260
It was an
unimaginable loneliness,

20:52.450 --> 20:56.220
one which Jack and I share.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.910
You're a liar, a deceiver.

20:58.110 --> 21:00.310
You wormed your way
into his head.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.400
He found me!

21:03.600 --> 21:05.180
At the very edge of space,

21:05.380 --> 21:08.750
where you left us, poisoned.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.320
No worlds to consume,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.750
no roads by which to return.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.320
Just the cruelty to die

21:16.520 --> 21:19.240
by starvation and age.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.890
And then,

21:22.090 --> 21:24.330
as the cries
of my children faded,

21:24.530 --> 21:26.680
another voice rose.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.380
Louder, clearer.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.730
- Jack's voice.
- [indistinct whispering]

21:32.930 --> 21:34.120
Let him go.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.950
Take me.
I'm the one you want.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.560
- Your equal.
- No.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.830
I don't want you, Locutus.

21:43.030 --> 21:46.270
The future
of the Borg does not lie in...

21:46.470 --> 21:49.230
assimilation

21:49.420 --> 21:52.490
but evolution.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.180
[indistinct whispering]

21:55.130 --> 21:57.180
[sensor beeping steadily]

22:08.280 --> 22:10.320
[sensor beeping faster]

22:12.630 --> 22:14.120
[beeping stops]

22:14.320 --> 22:16.720
I believe this terminal
is a central access node.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.860
Hope these Borg
have been too busy dying

22:20.060 --> 22:21.900
to upgrade their codecs.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.740
[tricorder trilling]

Accessing the cube's schematics
now. Worf to <i>Enterprise.</i>

of the beacon's coordinates.

<i>You're insane.</i>

22:35.430 --> 22:36.840
what little Collective
you had left.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.320
Only to sustain myself
long enough

22:39.520 --> 22:42.320
to arrive at this moment,

22:42.520 --> 22:45.800
to invite you here to witness.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.460
Witness what?

22:48.660 --> 22:51.200
Your future's

<i>So you</i>

23:23.170 --> 23:25.670

23:25.870 --> 23:28.540
to be your weapons
across the galaxy.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.060
They, too, shared the anger

23:30.260 --> 23:32.630
of a generation
lost to Starfleet.

23:32.830 --> 23:35.980
Together, we weaponized
your biology.

You've rewritten
our machine code

23:37.880 --> 23:40.070
into genetic code.

We've no need

26:46.690 --> 26:49.610
The good news is we have
a clear read on its position.

26:49.810 --> 26:51.660
The bad news is

26:51.860 --> 26:53.870
it's at the heart
of the cube itself.

GEORDI:
The only way
to take out the hive

27:03.560 --> 27:04.890
is to take out that beacon,

27:05.090 --> 27:06.890
but it's going to be impossible.

27:07.090 --> 27:09.020
I mean, no computer,
not even my daughter could

27:09.220 --> 27:11.670

are you doing?

27:21.800 --> 27:22.910

- Data, it's impossible.
- Data.

- Trust me.
- Data, I said no!

27:27.150 --> 27:30.870
Statistically, probability?
Yes. It's nearly impossible.

All right.

1:01:05.650 --> 1:01:08.890
My father told me all about you.

1:01:09.090 --> 1:01:10.850
- I thought you were dead.
- Oh.

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:12.800
And here I was hoping
the next generation

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.970
wouldn't think so linearly.

1:01:16.150 --> 1:01:17.630
Young mortal,

1:01:17.830 --> 1:01:20.280
you have much ahead of you.

1:01:23.410 --> 1:01:26.080
You told my father
that humanity's trial was over.

1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:27.640
It is.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:29.390
For him.

1:01:29.580 --> 1:01:31.740
But I'm here today
because of you.

1:01:31.940 --> 1:01:33.820
You see, yours,

1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:36.000
Jack...

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.910
has just begun.
