00:30.769 --> 00:33.147
There are nights so dark

00:33.660 --> 00:38.687
that the dawn is not merely distant
but beyond imagination.

00:38.712 --> 00:40.695
Oh...

00:40.720 --> 00:44.247
These are the hours where
grief lives,

00:44.630 --> 00:47.051
where fear rules,

00:47.240 --> 00:50.181
where truth lies exposed...

00:50.510 --> 00:52.118
..like a wound.

00:53.708 --> 00:58.347
Hope hides, peace is for others.

00:59.152 --> 01:01.177
The minutes extend,

01:01.357 --> 01:05.349
repeating the distress of the
hours that went before...

01:06.290 --> 01:11.270
..and every thought begins
and ends in silence.

01:32.618 --> 01:33.909
Valerie?

01:34.051 --> 01:35.384
You didn't come to bed.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.410
What was I going
to do there? Sleep?

01:38.150 --> 01:40.352
I wasn't exactly in
the Land of Nod myself.

01:48.034 --> 01:50.452
We're going to have to report
what happened.

01:52.301 --> 01:53.634
To Sister Julienne?

01:54.671 --> 01:56.280
Absolutely to Sister Julienne.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.105
And then to the police.

02:04.909 --> 02:06.550
Have a good day at school.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.751
Go to work on an egg,

02:10.794 --> 02:13.000
as they say in the magazine
advertisements!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.079
You don't have to do all this!

02:15.319 --> 02:17.009
You were up in the night with May.

02:17.034 --> 02:20.393
May was as right as rain after a
spell on the sofa and a hot drink.

02:21.731 --> 02:24.538
I think it's the trauma
of her impending move.

02:24.563 --> 02:27.156
It's upsetting me,
and I'm a grown man.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.707
Here's the sauce,
I've already shaken it.

02:29.732 --> 02:33.907
Patrick we have no choice but to
wave May off with smiles on our faces,

02:33.932 --> 02:35.497
because that is the
best thing for her.

02:35.897 --> 02:37.005
Of course it is.

02:38.447 --> 02:41.961
And I've decided that we need to
look to the future.

02:42.282 --> 02:45.245
The maternity home
needs its own incubator.

02:45.539 --> 02:48.779
I'm launching a fundraising drive,
and the first event is going to be

02:48.780 --> 02:51.715
a dance called the
Ballroom of Hope.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.808
Are you booking
the Hammersmith Palais?

02:53.833 --> 02:55.213
No, the Institute.

02:55.238 --> 02:56.710
Eat your eggs.

03:02.146 --> 03:05.398
Sister Hilda, there's a new
patient for the district round.

03:05.423 --> 03:08.810
Julie Shroeder,
43 Menton Road, aged 17.

03:09.049 --> 03:10.919
She's just been discharged
from St Cuthbert's

03:10.944 --> 03:12.707
after treatment
for Hodgkin's disease.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.804
Hodgkin's? Poor lamb.

03:17.289 --> 03:20.135
17 is awfully young
to be fighting cancer.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.271
Sadly, there's now nothing
more can be done for her,

03:22.296 --> 03:23.339
in terms of treatment,

03:23.704 --> 03:26.911
but she has some burns
following her radiotherapy,

03:27.125 --> 03:28.702
and we can help with dressings.

03:29.562 --> 03:30.708
Sister Julienne...

03:33.128 --> 03:35.579
..there's something Nurse Dyer
and I need to discuss with you.

03:43.709 --> 03:44.739
Fred!

03:45.852 --> 03:47.470
They're sending Reggie home!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.417
There's been an outbreak
of whooping cough,

03:49.441 --> 03:50.915
and they don't want him to catch it.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.782
You know he never does well
with his chest.

03:52.807 --> 03:54.794
I wasn't expecting to see him
till Christmas!

03:54.838 --> 03:56.734
Yes, but they've already put
him on the coach!

03:57.070 --> 04:00.322
What if he gets to the station
before we can be there to meet him?

04:09.764 --> 04:10.954
Come on, we're late.

04:12.704 --> 04:14.152
I don't know how you
like it, Sister,

04:14.294 --> 04:16.776
so you can help yourself
to the jug.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.623
I've been dying for you to tip up
just so as I can have a sit-down.

04:20.935 --> 04:23.351
You should seize all the rest
you can get with both hands,

04:23.376 --> 04:24.376
Mrs Shroeder.

04:24.585 --> 04:26.755
How many little
brothers have you got?

04:27.437 --> 04:30.429
They don't stand still long
enough for me to count.

04:33.429 --> 04:35.223
Eh, you poor darling.

04:35.248 --> 04:38.189
These radiation burns look so sore!

04:38.214 --> 04:39.225
They are sore.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.252
Hello, love.

04:40.805 --> 04:43.735
Ah, we have company.

04:44.121 --> 04:45.678
I forgot my sandwiches.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.482
Oh, they're on the twin-tub.

04:47.507 --> 04:48.547
Spam and pickle.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.542
He was a prisoner of war,
in case you're wondering.

04:53.791 --> 04:55.473
Julie was five when we met...

04:55.911 --> 04:57.039
..and petrified!

04:57.113 --> 04:59.351
She'd only ever heard Germans
being called the enemy.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.759
I imagine you soon became
the best of chums!

05:03.111 --> 05:04.387
Something like that.

05:05.253 --> 05:09.833
Although... going to school
with a surname like Shroeder

05:09.858 --> 05:11.335
wasn't much fun.

05:13.044 --> 05:16.052
You Sisters, you are midwives, too?

05:17.063 --> 05:18.884
You have a word with my Ena, huh?

05:21.328 --> 05:24.367
She hasn't seen a nurse
in six months.

05:24.475 --> 05:28.191
Six months?! We shall
have to take you in hand.

05:28.654 --> 05:31.357
You must show me your
co-op card, before I go.

05:34.016 --> 05:37.927
And it was in the ambulance
that the foetus was aborted?

05:38.309 --> 05:39.332
Yes.

05:39.357 --> 05:42.273
I injected the girl with the
ergometrine immediately afterwards.

05:42.369 --> 05:44.401
While she was still pregnant,
I wasn't able to.

05:46.784 --> 05:49.247
All my life, she's had
an oven full of readies.

05:49.721 --> 05:51.273
Pound notes. Ten bob notes.

05:52.128 --> 05:54.019
Never occurred to me
to ask where it came from,

05:54.996 --> 05:58.043
or why it didn't run out after she
gave up her stall on the market.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.491
And do you know how much Miss Banley
paid for the procedure?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.065
Seven pounds.

06:07.783 --> 06:09.352
Precisely seven pounds?

06:09.632 --> 06:13.111
She said all the other
abortionists charge ten.

06:14.017 --> 06:15.625
Some even charge guineas.

06:16.878 --> 06:17.886
But not her.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.933
It's all coming together
in the most splendid way!

06:23.154 --> 06:26.276
There's a mirror ball in storage
somewhere, and with plenty of

06:26.301 --> 06:29.329
crepe paper streamers, it
should look most effective.

06:29.593 --> 06:32.175
There'll be a number of
speciality dances,

06:32.200 --> 06:36.212
including a spot waltz with prizes
and a pensioners' valeta.

06:36.799 --> 06:37.802
What do you think?

06:37.827 --> 06:40.209
I think it's the most
marvellous opportunity

06:40.234 --> 06:44.004
to dispense with the trapeze-line
shift and run up some fabulous frocks!

06:44.029 --> 06:46.343
I've rather missed
the cinched-in waist.

06:46.712 --> 06:47.787
Me too!

06:48.588 --> 06:51.028
On other people, obviously.

06:51.473 --> 06:54.179
Excellent! But we still need a judge

06:54.204 --> 06:57.402
for Most Appealing Family
Pairing On The Dance Floor,

06:57.427 --> 06:59.563
and someone to organise the tombola.

06:59.588 --> 07:02.292
I should be delighted
to oblige with the latter.

07:02.930 --> 07:04.521
Organise the tombola?

07:05.039 --> 07:07.033
For as Plato once observed,

07:07.209 --> 07:11.602
"Arithmetic has a very great
and elevating effect,

07:11.953 --> 07:16.088
"compelling the soul to reason
with regard to abstract number."

07:16.713 --> 07:19.145
There's a call for you, Nurse Dyer.

07:19.957 --> 07:21.260
It's Sergeant Woolf.

07:33.781 --> 07:36.632
A photograph! A photograph, Trixie!

07:38.036 --> 07:40.334
And I quote, "Something from
the family album,

07:40.359 --> 07:41.801
"no more than two years old."

07:43.751 --> 07:45.653
Can't the police
take a picture themselves?

07:45.852 --> 07:47.057
A mugshot, that's what I said.

07:47.513 --> 07:49.915
But they can't do that until the
person's been charged, so...

08:03.133 --> 08:04.334
I need some scissors.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.837
Your blood pressure is
spot-on, Mrs Shroeder.

08:42.131 --> 08:44.593
But I'm not very impressed
with your ankles.

08:44.971 --> 08:46.255
They're swollen.

08:46.615 --> 08:49.258
Will you give over with that
cricket ball in the house?

08:50.495 --> 08:51.752
Just cos their dad's a glazier,

08:51.777 --> 08:53.861
they think it don't matter
if they smash the windows!

08:54.560 --> 08:55.715
Four kids.

08:55.809 --> 08:57.288
And a fifth on the way!

08:57.313 --> 08:59.400
You wouldn't think it,
the way she carries on.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.473
She won't rest, Nurse!

09:01.927 --> 09:03.314
She won't eat liver.

09:03.724 --> 09:05.018
She won't even knit.

09:05.965 --> 09:08.895
Everyone in the family way knits!

09:08.920 --> 09:11.470
The layette is none of my
business, Mrs Shroeder.

09:12.262 --> 09:14.278
But if you do not make
allowances for your health,

09:14.303 --> 09:15.684
then neither will Mother Nature.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.552
And you will end up on the
books at St Cuthbert's.

09:19.805 --> 09:20.931
Not going back there.

09:21.268 --> 09:23.284
Even the smell of that place
makes me gag.

09:24.138 --> 09:26.214
Makes her gag, too. Don't it?

09:26.421 --> 09:28.793
I dunno how I'm going to get
her through the door next time.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.819
Mum!

09:30.150 --> 09:31.800
What if there isn't a next time?

09:32.095 --> 09:34.460
Those doctors will stop at
nothing, Julie!

09:34.573 --> 09:37.399
You say that, and Dad says
that, but what if...?

09:37.424 --> 09:39.298
The only way there
won't be a next time

09:39.323 --> 09:41.152
is if you're cured
once and for all.

09:41.861 --> 09:44.021
Now eat that toast,
I don't want it wasted.

09:55.242 --> 09:57.198
Yeah. That's her.

10:09.225 --> 10:12.370
You've never seen Come Dancing
because it's past your bedtime,

10:12.768 --> 10:16.695
but you're going to look just like
one of the pretty ladies

10:16.880 --> 10:19.055
in a lovely sticky-out dress!

10:19.080 --> 10:20.717
- Isn't that exciting?
- Yes.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.406
Can I have a dress?

10:24.675 --> 10:25.751
Oh, May!

10:26.462 --> 10:29.569
You'll have gone to live with your
new mummy and daddy by then.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.885
You'll be having a
lovely time with them!

10:33.629 --> 10:36.924
How about I make Dolly Molly
a frock,

10:36.949 --> 10:38.180
the same as Angela's,

10:38.257 --> 10:40.655
and then you can take her
with you, all dressed up?

10:54.147 --> 10:56.162
Hope you're not going
to put me in handcuffs.

10:56.897 --> 10:59.719
This has all been very misjudged.

11:00.221 --> 11:01.743
And I've got neighbours.

11:02.305 --> 11:03.329
Sergeant Woolf.

11:15.289 --> 11:16.841
Escort her to the car.

11:31.853 --> 11:33.091
You took ages.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.579
That's a bit personal, Reggie.

11:37.380 --> 11:40.863
Come on, let's go and have a
gander at that dripping tap.

11:43.443 --> 11:45.876
Do you want me to come with you
to say hello to some of them?

11:46.017 --> 11:47.502
See if you can make friends?

11:47.555 --> 11:48.723
I've got friends.

11:48.924 --> 11:50.566
But it's just not here.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.948
It's the sort of thing that
makes your blood run cold.

11:56.155 --> 11:58.683
Young girl bent double...

11:59.896 --> 12:01.607
..blood running down her legs.

12:02.251 --> 12:06.286
She'd been found down
the side street, collapsed.

12:08.017 --> 12:09.667
And what did the girl say to you?

12:10.746 --> 12:13.456
All the way up the stairs,
she kept saying sorry,

12:13.827 --> 12:16.377
that she'd tried to bring on
the miscarriage herself.

12:17.276 --> 12:18.948
And why didn't you call
for an ambulance?

12:19.065 --> 12:20.727
Because she was ashamed.

12:20.937 --> 12:22.160
She was scared.

12:22.185 --> 12:24.521
And she didn't want the
police involved!

12:25.199 --> 12:29.727
Did the young lady describe
the implement she'd used?

12:30.306 --> 12:31.307
Something sharp.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.551
Something sharp like one of these?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.959
Those instruments are top quality.

12:42.385 --> 12:45.424
I buy them in the chemist,
for lancing my carbuncle,

12:45.704 --> 12:47.159
on medical advice.

12:47.648 --> 12:50.096
I'm a great respecter of
medical advice,

12:50.724 --> 12:52.554
that's why I sent for my
granddaughter.

12:52.579 --> 12:54.289
Your granddaughter, the midwife?

12:55.948 --> 12:57.728
Who attended along with her
colleague,

12:57.900 --> 12:59.201
also a midwife.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.935
We have statements from them both.

13:03.579 --> 13:05.988
I thought a plant might suit today,

13:06.789 --> 13:10.627
for ease of transportation
once you're discharged.

13:11.355 --> 13:14.752
Um I also called in at Nonnatus House

13:14.777 --> 13:17.649
and collected some slacks
and blouses for you.

13:17.934 --> 13:20.916
Simple, easy garments
suitable for light exercise

13:20.941 --> 13:22.698
within a convalescent context.

13:22.723 --> 13:26.394
I haven't been ill, Miss Higgins,
merely immobilised.

13:27.069 --> 13:28.397
When they let me out of here,

13:28.422 --> 13:31.418
I shall be sprinting down the
Commercial Road like Ann Packer!

13:36.260 --> 13:40.365
"When pastures fresh beckon
And new dawns the light

13:40.390 --> 13:43.488
"Don't rush to be active
And pick up the fight

13:43.576 --> 13:45.495
"Instead rest and be thankful

13:45.520 --> 13:47.925
"You're now almost hale

13:48.287 --> 13:50.398
"But let friends support you

13:50.700 --> 13:53.329
"Remember - you're frail!"

13:55.712 --> 13:57.700
I take it this is Patience Strong.

13:58.065 --> 13:59.073
No!

14:00.072 --> 14:01.128
I wrote it myself.

14:02.724 --> 14:03.752
Ah.

14:06.035 --> 14:07.055
Gran!

14:09.241 --> 14:11.477
Gran, open the door.
I know you're at home.

14:14.117 --> 14:15.893
I know you pleaded not guilty, Gran.

14:15.918 --> 14:16.926
I read it in the papers.

14:21.714 --> 14:23.912
You're going to have to go to
court now, and...

14:27.247 --> 14:29.018
..and I'm going to
have to go to court.

14:30.367 --> 14:34.333
I can't change what I did,
any more than you can.

14:36.539 --> 14:38.148
But promise me you'll stop!

14:42.515 --> 14:44.098
Promise me!

14:48.476 --> 14:51.423
I can't wait to see all the
frocks people are making!

14:51.833 --> 14:54.662
I already need an extra
supply of zip fasteners

14:54.687 --> 14:57.148
in sugared-almond shades.

14:58.876 --> 15:01.358
Right, off you pop.

15:02.037 --> 15:04.209
Get these orders in the post for me.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.107
Oh, would you like half a crown,

15:06.132 --> 15:09.626
to get some iced buns for our
elevenses?

15:09.651 --> 15:11.661
No. Not really.

15:11.779 --> 15:12.958
Oh, well...

15:14.140 --> 15:15.759
..come straight back, hmm?

15:22.483 --> 15:24.298
Where've you been, Fred Buckle?

15:24.689 --> 15:25.787
Using the facilities.

15:25.812 --> 15:28.531
Oh, you're always using
the facilities!

15:29.517 --> 15:31.000
Reggie's not himself, Fred.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.671
He needs jollying along.

15:32.819 --> 15:34.277
Bringing out of himself.

15:34.754 --> 15:36.297
I'm trying my best, Vi.

15:36.322 --> 15:38.248
But there's nothing coming
back the other way.

15:38.950 --> 15:41.476
It's normally so lovely
when he's at home.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.322
Goodbye, little May.

16:18.524 --> 16:19.588
Bye-bye.

16:29.669 --> 16:31.648
Excellent, thank you.
Put that up straight away.

16:31.797 --> 16:35.352
I've only just got the glitter ball
out of storage, Mrs Turner!

16:35.377 --> 16:37.958
It doesn't want hanging straight
away, it needs cleaning.

16:38.036 --> 16:39.814
If we don't put it in position now,

16:39.839 --> 16:41.613
we won't know if these
decorative streamers

16:41.638 --> 16:43.771
are going to prove effective,
or even practical.

16:45.649 --> 16:48.902
Mrs Turner, you can't climb
a ladder in court shoes!

16:48.936 --> 16:51.653
I actually appear to be doing
so perfectly efficiently.

16:52.358 --> 16:54.332
I take it your daughter was
instrumental

16:54.357 --> 16:56.473
in you keeping your
appointment this afternoon?

16:56.498 --> 16:58.176
She's been cracking
the whip no end.

16:58.312 --> 17:00.651
We're going past the wool shop
on the way home, apparently.

17:01.212 --> 17:03.958
GLASS SHATTERS Oh, no, Fred!

17:08.369 --> 17:09.395
Any casualties?

17:09.923 --> 17:11.069
Just the mirror ball.

17:11.555 --> 17:13.160
And Fred's pride!

17:14.087 --> 17:16.707
Present from Mrs Ena Shroeder.

17:16.858 --> 17:18.382
Everything now present and correct.

17:20.017 --> 17:21.976
Are you getting in some practice

17:22.001 --> 17:24.320
for when your new baby
brother or sister arrives?

17:24.346 --> 17:26.560
I don't need to get practice in
for anything else, do I?

17:28.344 --> 17:30.131
I'm never going to have
a baby of my own.

17:30.439 --> 17:32.168
You mustn't talk like that, Julie!

17:32.193 --> 17:34.013
I want to talk like that!

17:34.643 --> 17:36.217
They told us at the hospital.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.711
They said that
the treatment hadn't worked.

17:40.161 --> 17:42.370
No doctor and no nurse
should ever tell a patient

17:42.395 --> 17:43.566
there is nothing they can do.

17:43.591 --> 17:45.260
Well, why shouldn't they,
if it's true?

17:48.409 --> 17:50.107
Mum doesn't want to believe 'em.

17:51.524 --> 17:53.126
Dad just goes along with it.

17:53.544 --> 17:55.244
But I haven't got the choice.

17:57.391 --> 17:58.435
I know.

18:02.986 --> 18:04.041
Hello, Maureen.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.640
What are you doing here? You
expecting another addition?

18:06.732 --> 18:09.512
No, I'm not expecting
another bloody addition.

18:09.951 --> 18:11.983
And I don't want to buy
ballroom tickets either.

18:13.006 --> 18:15.876
Elsie Dyer might be
your grandmother,

18:16.242 --> 18:18.520
but she's got family
all over this borough.

18:19.149 --> 18:20.421
She's my mother's aunt.

18:20.643 --> 18:24.399
- I know...
- Oh, you know all sorts of things!

18:24.424 --> 18:27.487
Valerie "Nose In The Air,
Up My Own Backside" Dyer.

18:27.965 --> 18:32.148
Valerie "Look At Me Swanning
Round With All The Nuns"!

18:32.202 --> 18:34.588
You might know a lot of
things about the human body,

18:34.725 --> 18:36.730
but I don't s'pose
anyone's ever told you -

18:37.076 --> 18:39.632
blood is thicker than water!

18:39.657 --> 18:41.247
You stop this right now!

18:41.711 --> 18:43.772
This is a clinic,
not a fish market,

18:43.887 --> 18:46.288
and you are talking
to a uniformed professional

18:46.313 --> 18:47.989
who is entitled to respect.

18:48.574 --> 18:49.691
I am, am I?

18:49.907 --> 18:52.595
Cos I thought I was just
talking to a stuck-up turncoat

18:52.620 --> 18:54.624
who's forgotten whose side
she's supposed to be on!

18:55.043 --> 18:57.724
You heard me. I want you out
of that door.

19:15.908 --> 19:19.580
Oh, welcome, gentle sir. And enter!

19:19.605 --> 19:22.168
I wouldn't leave this left standing
unattended, Sister.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.549
You got two bottles of sherry
and a tin of pilchards

19:24.574 --> 19:26.469
- left here for the tombola.
- Come.

19:28.685 --> 19:32.188
Are you absolutely certain the hospital
told both Julie and her family?

19:32.286 --> 19:35.013
That's what Julie said to me.
And I listened.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.617
Because it seems to me nobody else
wants to hear a word she's saying.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.913
Good evening, ladies!

19:42.050 --> 19:43.751
Oh!

19:44.002 --> 19:45.005
Ah!

19:45.030 --> 19:49.742
None of them were deshabille when
I was summoned by the bell.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.422
What in the good Lord's
name are you doing

19:51.447 --> 19:52.755
coming round here
without notice?

19:52.891 --> 19:56.003
Erm, Mrs Theodore called a
prayer meeting at her house.

19:56.214 --> 19:57.663
I thought you might like to come.

19:58.454 --> 19:59.745
Sister Frances!

19:59.770 --> 20:01.276
Get that shopping
list off the table,

20:01.301 --> 20:02.900
and send him to Violet
Buckle's with it.

20:02.925 --> 20:04.513
Tell him to make himself useful!

20:12.999 --> 20:15.353
Er, thread - machine twist 40,

20:15.884 --> 20:18.879
one each of orchid, mid orchid,

20:18.953 --> 20:21.612
blue green and light gladioli.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.703
Netting starch.

20:23.885 --> 20:25.459
How much netting starch?

20:25.484 --> 20:26.981
Oh, Lucille didn't say.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.771
But there is a lot of netting.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.417
Oh, no. Oh, Mrs Buckle, no.

20:35.770 --> 20:36.787
Erm...

20:41.433 --> 20:43.075
Where do you keep
the handkerchiefs?

20:43.100 --> 20:44.117
Erm...

20:44.600 --> 20:47.481
..initialled, lace and fancy,
third drawer down.

21:01.664 --> 21:03.147
I know it's silly,

21:03.574 --> 21:06.507
but, erm, Fred's always been so...

21:07.303 --> 21:09.702
..cheerful up till now, and

21:10.502 --> 21:11.711
Reggie, well...

21:12.305 --> 21:15.752
..usually, he's very uncomplicated.

21:17.547 --> 21:20.953
Mrs Buckle, I haven't seen my
mother for a year or two,

21:21.929 --> 21:24.052
but she would always talk
about a woman's intuition.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.258
And what I say is this,

21:27.041 --> 21:28.433
where men are concerned,

21:28.775 --> 21:32.034
sometimes a woman's intuition
doesn't get her anywhere.

21:32.434 --> 21:34.495
You need to let the men talk
to the men.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.263
Let them sort it out
between themselves.

21:40.193 --> 21:41.199
Hm?

21:42.954 --> 21:45.420
Knock, knock. Special delivery!

21:45.445 --> 21:49.295
- Oh, is that my gas and air?
- This is oxygen, Mrs Shroeder.

21:49.532 --> 21:50.562
And it's for Julie.

21:50.587 --> 21:51.607
Oh.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.533
It will help her with her breathing,
if she starts to feel unwell.

21:58.299 --> 22:00.458
We'll have a practice with
the mask later on, poppet.

22:01.401 --> 22:03.727
Oops! Sequin on the carpet.

22:04.562 --> 22:06.011
No. Two.

22:06.387 --> 22:08.001
Apologies, Mrs Shroeder.

22:08.187 --> 22:10.467
Sister and I must've brought
them in on our shoes.

22:10.531 --> 22:11.561
Can I see?

22:12.093 --> 22:13.103
Oh.

22:16.358 --> 22:18.466
Are these, to do with that dance?

22:18.555 --> 22:20.951
Nonnatus House is becoming
quite the frock factory!

22:22.716 --> 22:24.728
I've always wanted to go to a dance.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.732
Twirl around under the mirror ball,
like you see in the films.

22:30.855 --> 22:33.647
Before I was ill, I was too young.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.447
And now...

22:38.288 --> 22:39.866
Well, it's just now.

22:44.891 --> 22:46.327
I can see another sequin!

22:47.239 --> 22:49.911
It's lying over there,
like a tiny little star.

22:52.294 --> 22:53.298
Do you know, Julie?

22:53.524 --> 22:56.648
There really are plenty more spangles
and furbelows where that came from.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.382
We'll have you turning every
head in the Ballroom of Hope.

22:59.406 --> 23:00.429
Oh, no.

23:00.454 --> 23:01.743
I can't dance.

23:02.271 --> 23:03.286
I'll teach you.

23:03.485 --> 23:06.108
I was a dab hand at the foxtrot,
before I took the veil.

23:07.158 --> 23:09.092
Do you think the doctor will let me?

23:10.699 --> 23:12.947
I think you might find it's just
what the doctor ordered.

23:18.704 --> 23:22.636
Corned beef hash,
beetroot or pickled cabbage.

23:22.929 --> 23:24.357
The choice is yours!

23:25.990 --> 23:27.094
Are you going out?

23:27.771 --> 23:30.513
I've got a meeting with Mrs
Turner about the decorations

23:30.538 --> 23:34.655
for the Ballroom of Hope, now that
we seem to be minus a mirror ball.

23:34.859 --> 23:39.299
Here's ten shillings,
take each other to the pub.

23:40.682 --> 23:44.379
You've never given me money to go to
the pub in four years of marriage.

23:44.487 --> 23:46.435
Reggie's only to have shandy.

23:46.460 --> 23:47.888
And I want the change.

23:53.089 --> 23:56.260
As you'll doubtless be performing
only partial duties

23:56.285 --> 23:58.453
on your return
to Nonnatus House,

23:59.122 --> 24:02.378
I thought you might like to join me

24:02.514 --> 24:05.633
at the Townswomen's Guild
on Thursday afternoons.

24:05.658 --> 24:08.952
I think you'll find I shall be in
harness every afternoon,

24:08.977 --> 24:10.481
including Thursdays.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.119
Sergeant Woolf!

24:13.148 --> 24:15.004
What an unexpected pleasure.

24:15.148 --> 24:17.860
Oh, please. Aubrey - when
I'm in my sports jacket.

24:18.138 --> 24:20.905
Miss Higgins, have
you met Sergeant Woolf?

24:20.930 --> 24:22.478
We are acquainted, of course.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.001
Especially picked
from my own greenhouse.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.393
How nice.

24:26.705 --> 24:29.176
My father used to grow
chrysanthemums.

24:29.942 --> 24:31.086
From the Cubs.

24:32.254 --> 24:34.279
We had a potato stamping session.

24:34.582 --> 24:36.719
Some of the lads got quite creative.

24:36.970 --> 24:39.367
Well, Miss Higgins makes
greetings cards,

24:39.392 --> 24:41.792
perhaps we should ask her
to give them some lessons.

24:50.361 --> 24:52.834
That's absolutely charming.

24:53.929 --> 24:57.633
And such a well-chosen verse! I'm a
great admirer of Patience Strong.

24:58.583 --> 25:01.111
No, Miss Higgins wrote that herself.

25:02.707 --> 25:04.711
- A poetess!
- Oh!

25:06.462 --> 25:08.638
One dabbles, Sergeant Woolf.

25:24.420 --> 25:25.746
Well, what's up with you, Reggie?

25:25.771 --> 25:27.057
What's up with you?

25:28.771 --> 25:31.294
Honest to God, man to man?

25:31.436 --> 25:34.066
I've been having a bit of trouble
with me old waterworks.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.621
You fixed that tap.

25:35.753 --> 25:38.915
No, no, I mean, er, down below.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.735
When I go to the gents,
my bladder.

25:42.017 --> 25:44.121
Oh! Got to go to the doctor.

25:44.809 --> 25:47.253
Nah. It'll go away.

25:48.759 --> 25:50.042
So what about you?

25:52.783 --> 25:54.246
I miss my girlfriend.

25:55.183 --> 25:56.489
You've got a girlfriend?

25:56.854 --> 25:58.325
She's called Jane.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.297
Is she pretty?

26:00.610 --> 26:02.630
No. Beautiful.

26:02.655 --> 26:05.755
Oh, Reggie! Can I tell Violet?

26:06.698 --> 26:09.048
Ay, but not a word about my
waterworks, ay?

26:09.511 --> 26:10.654
That was men's talk.

26:15.283 --> 26:18.735
She'll be needing a pair of
dance shoes, too, Mr Shroeder.

26:19.074 --> 26:22.924
I can't imagine the get-up we're
planning going very well

26:22.949 --> 26:24.357
with a pair of brown lace-ups!

26:24.880 --> 26:28.459
I'd rather she preserved her
strength than went out dancing.

26:30.424 --> 26:34.700
Well, I shall delve into our
storeroom and see what I can find.

26:41.002 --> 26:44.116
What a positively, doleful-looking
Madeira cake!

26:44.199 --> 26:46.575
I'm not saying I don't like
Madeira cake,

26:46.600 --> 26:48.556
I'm just always glad
when I've had enough.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.693
Before we say grace
and commence our meal,

26:51.718 --> 26:53.180
I have two pieces of news.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.360
Firstly, and most happily,

26:55.531 --> 26:57.792
Nurse Crane returns to us
the day after tomorrow.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.712
At last! I'll make sure
her bed is aired.

27:03.075 --> 27:04.095
And secondly...

27:05.239 --> 27:07.294
..I had a telephone call
from the police.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.767
Teresa Banley will not be
giving evidence.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.586
But her evidence
is absolutely vital.

27:12.908 --> 27:15.406
She's not just the victim,
she's the complainant!

27:16.027 --> 27:17.949
And with no complainant,
there's no case.

27:18.127 --> 27:20.527
The charge still stands
against Mrs Dyer.

27:21.621 --> 27:24.927
Miss Banley has been granted a
medical exemption certificate,

27:24.952 --> 27:28.461
and her statement will merely
be read out to the court.

27:28.963 --> 27:32.888
But can't anyone talk to her,
tell her just how important

27:32.913 --> 27:34.796
it is that she tells her
story in person?

27:35.170 --> 27:37.224
I've been given this information
as a fait accompli.

27:37.712 --> 27:42.427
The law will take its course and we
will not discuss this further.

27:43.555 --> 27:45.844
What good is just reading
something out going to do?

27:45.888 --> 27:48.492
A few words, typed by a secretary
and read by a man!

27:48.795 --> 27:51.932
You're women,
and you're midwives,

27:52.411 --> 27:54.776
and you can describe
exactly what you saw.

27:55.293 --> 27:58.715
If we do it well enough, I'll be
putting my own grandma behind bars.

27:59.612 --> 28:02.567
And if Mrs Dyer had pleaded guilty,
you wouldn't have to do that.

28:03.251 --> 28:04.739
And if the laws were different,

28:05.264 --> 28:08.053
she wouldn't have needed to
run a sideline in abortion.

28:08.078 --> 28:10.397
Why does it have to be us
who try to stop her?

28:11.434 --> 28:13.267
Why should I have to go to court?

28:18.203 --> 28:19.390
Jane?

28:20.306 --> 28:21.373
Jane?!

28:21.776 --> 28:23.772
How could Reggie have told
you such a thing,

28:23.797 --> 28:26.521
and all you bothered to find
out is that she's called Jane?

28:26.926 --> 28:28.958
We don't even know her surname!

28:32.120 --> 28:35.667
He told me she's got cheeks
the colour of pink ice cream

28:35.970 --> 28:37.448
and she likes pansies.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.855
But no, no surname.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.473
What if it's all one-sided?

28:43.829 --> 28:46.434
What if she's just someone
that he's seen somewhere?

28:46.532 --> 28:50.156
She could be a member of staff,
and either he's got it all wrong,

28:50.181 --> 28:52.382
or she could be taking advantage!

28:52.919 --> 28:54.904
I'm not happy about this at all.

29:01.487 --> 29:03.469
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

29:04.012 --> 29:07.744
This is Mr Alfred Shroeder
of 43 Menton Road.

29:07.769 --> 29:11.038
They don't care who you are, Dad!
Just tell 'em Mum's in labour.

29:13.838 --> 29:14.873
Right.

29:15.216 --> 29:17.723
I've spoken to Reggie's
gardening supervisor.

29:17.909 --> 29:19.443
He seems to know him quite well.

29:19.745 --> 29:21.538
Jane is one of the residents.

29:21.563 --> 29:24.917
And she's as sweet on Reggie
as Reggie is on her.

29:24.942 --> 29:27.707
And, erm, she's like him, Fred.

29:27.708 --> 29:30.461
Oh, good on him, that's what I say!

29:30.486 --> 29:32.930
I mean, we sent him there so he
could meet folk like himself.

29:32.955 --> 29:34.536
I just hope it lasts.

29:35.229 --> 29:36.749
I mean, if it's real.

29:37.913 --> 29:39.499
I don't want him to be hurt!

29:44.355 --> 29:48.508
No-one can go through life without
experiencing any pain at all.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.383
I'd miss you if I had to go away.

30:00.938 --> 30:02.055
That's right, Mum.

30:02.964 --> 30:05.607
You show those contractions
who's boss.

30:11.223 --> 30:12.440
Back with you now, love.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.667
I thought it would hurt you more.

30:14.794 --> 30:16.753
No.

30:16.778 --> 30:18.699
Things only really hurt
when you're scared,

30:18.992 --> 30:20.127
and I'm not scared.

30:22.590 --> 30:25.559
I thought I'd pop in and have
a look at my star patient.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.582
Your star patient's got a patient
of her own this morning.

30:30.458 --> 30:33.653
Come and get this gown on.
We've got work to do.

30:44.193 --> 30:45.633
Hey, Reg.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.802
Basildon Bond!

30:47.827 --> 30:49.659
No expense spared, ay?

30:50.338 --> 30:52.288
And I've written our address
in the corner,

30:52.313 --> 30:53.565
just to get you started off.

30:53.599 --> 30:55.767
But then the rest of the letter
is for you to say

30:55.926 --> 30:57.452
whatever it is you want to say.

30:57.934 --> 31:00.228
Fred and I are just here
to help you with the spelling.

31:01.962 --> 31:03.955
I'll start, "Dear Jane."

31:05.292 --> 31:06.426
Very nice.

31:06.451 --> 31:07.776
Then, "I love you."

31:08.113 --> 31:09.670
No, no, no.

31:10.397 --> 31:12.470
You gotta keep 'em keen, Reg.

31:12.924 --> 31:14.422
How about...

31:14.596 --> 31:15.881
.. "I hope you're well"?

31:19.680 --> 31:22.531
Nurse Anderson says your
wife is doing splendidly.

31:23.302 --> 31:25.670
Tea, and a plate
of bread and butter.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.121
There's absolutely
nothing like it

31:27.146 --> 31:29.115
when one's been up
since the small hours.

31:30.459 --> 31:32.476
When I was a child in Germany,

31:32.974 --> 31:34.631
the smell of bread

31:34.656 --> 31:37.680
could, make my stomach clench...

31:38.878 --> 31:40.023
..like a fist.

31:40.825 --> 31:43.617
It was other people's bread,
you see, not mine.

31:45.176 --> 31:46.207
Hard times?

31:46.878 --> 31:49.022
The economy had collapsed...

31:50.401 --> 31:52.082
..and the inflation came.

31:53.317 --> 31:59.005
A loaf of bread cost
200,000 million marks.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.510
My little sister, Berta,

32:05.535 --> 32:06.724
she was so sick.

32:08.910 --> 32:11.432
She was white as paper.

32:13.285 --> 32:17.424
Her hands were thin, like leaves.

32:20.434 --> 32:23.310
She died with her head
on my shoulder.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.432
So light...

32:28.728 --> 32:31.016
..I could scarcely feel it
resting there.

32:35.502 --> 32:36.534
How old was she?

32:38.078 --> 32:39.343
Five.

32:39.997 --> 32:42.777
The same age as Julie was,
when I met her mother.

32:43.069 --> 32:45.283
I would look at Julie and I
would think,

32:45.572 --> 32:47.541
"You are so well fed.

32:48.358 --> 32:49.992
"You are so warm."

32:51.698 --> 32:56.122
I thought then
that she did not need my love.

32:58.319 --> 33:00.275
But I think it more true that...

33:01.241 --> 33:03.488
..I could not give Julie my
love then,

33:03.513 --> 33:04.787
and I cannot now.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.822
But you could give it to her now.

33:07.962 --> 33:09.199
She needs it now.

33:10.015 --> 33:12.329
Just as much as she needs
to feel normal and...

33:14.155 --> 33:16.281
..and dance underneath a
mirror ball!

33:23.564 --> 33:26.064
Not that the latter
will actually be happening,

33:26.089 --> 33:28.652
thanks to an episode of
clumsiness by the janitor.

34:03.017 --> 34:07.132
I cannot discern whether you
are dusting or at prayer.

34:07.943 --> 34:13.081
Whichever should be the case,
I deduce you are not succeeding.

34:14.416 --> 34:15.658
Will I get better at it?

34:16.449 --> 34:19.913
From experience, I would
advise that you will not.

34:21.329 --> 34:23.551
But you will become more patient,

34:23.931 --> 34:26.205
and therein know true grace.

34:29.473 --> 34:30.889
Sister Monica Joan...

34:32.542 --> 34:33.956
..may I talk to you?

34:35.319 --> 34:36.347
Always.

34:38.252 --> 34:39.255
Not here.

34:42.277 --> 34:43.362
I've had enough.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.228
I will have none of that
defeatist talk!

34:46.385 --> 34:48.900
With your next push, we're going
to have baby's head,

34:48.926 --> 34:51.141
and this whole room is going to
be rejoicing.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.937
You keep it coming now.

34:58.962 --> 35:01.505
Short, short, short pushes,

35:01.530 --> 35:02.543
short breaths.

35:04.529 --> 35:05.564
Yes!

35:06.941 --> 35:07.956
Yes!

35:08.901 --> 35:09.933
We have a head!

35:09.958 --> 35:11.233
Magnificent work!

35:11.553 --> 35:12.884
Are you all right, poppet?

35:14.090 --> 35:16.223
That's it! That's it!

35:16.248 --> 35:18.454
Come on, Mum! Come on Mum!

35:19.176 --> 35:20.782
Well done, Ena!

35:36.542 --> 35:38.002
You have a daughter, Ena!

35:38.733 --> 35:39.899
Well done.

35:42.729 --> 35:44.285
Do you want to hold her first?

35:57.510 --> 35:58.555
Look at that!

35:59.473 --> 36:01.420
My eldest and my youngest.

36:01.947 --> 36:04.727
You two girls'll be giving your
brothers the runaround for years!

36:05.504 --> 36:06.556
We should let Dad in.

36:07.968 --> 36:09.139
He's going to love her.

36:17.599 --> 36:18.786
Good morning, Reggie.

36:19.293 --> 36:20.516
Nice flowers.

36:20.541 --> 36:21.544
Thank you.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.751
They were a gift from a...

36:24.484 --> 36:25.500
..a friend.

36:27.149 --> 36:28.176
Mmm.

36:28.775 --> 36:30.322
This for Dr Turner.

36:30.671 --> 36:31.689
Ah.

36:33.329 --> 36:36.146
Oh, and it's very, very personal.

36:37.443 --> 36:40.249
"Fred bladder sore. Fred sad."

36:40.937 --> 36:41.951
Thank you.

36:42.197 --> 36:44.209
I shall pass this on to Doctor.

36:48.149 --> 36:49.199
You may...

36:50.064 --> 36:54.021
..return to the night of the
criminal incident in the bathroom.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.055
I remember everything
that happened to that girl,

36:59.631 --> 37:02.756
from the moment she knocked
on our door with her sister.

37:04.882 --> 37:09.172
I remember us whispering, because
Sergeant Woolf was in the house.

37:10.807 --> 37:12.055
I remember...

37:13.718 --> 37:15.180
..the blood on her legs...

37:17.057 --> 37:19.061
..the tears on her face...

37:20.712 --> 37:23.911
..and the smell of the foetus
as it came away.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.325
It had festered within her.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.623
She was ill with an infection.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.620
I'd put money on it being
streptococcus...

37:37.162 --> 37:38.877
..if we were allowed to gamble.

37:39.971 --> 37:43.390
But there's so much
we aren't allowed to do!

37:44.225 --> 37:48.719
I couldn't shout, "Why?
How can this happen?"

37:49.159 --> 37:50.187
I couldn't...

37:51.265 --> 37:54.057
I couldn't ask what had
happened to the baby.

37:54.082 --> 37:55.094
I couldn't...

37:56.574 --> 37:58.496
..demand that anyone be punished.

37:59.053 --> 38:01.975
Punishment is not ours
to administer.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.891
Can't the anger be ours to feel?

38:07.127 --> 38:11.088
I was sent to clean the floor,
and nothing more was said.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.345
What do you want to say?

38:19.488 --> 38:20.491
That...

38:22.333 --> 38:24.107
..I know her name was Cath.

38:26.403 --> 38:27.918
That she was beautiful.

38:28.602 --> 38:33.482
That... she looked like a model,
in a dress the colour of lipstick.

38:34.214 --> 38:35.381
And that...

38:36.518 --> 38:40.240
..there are women and girls that
have to do what she did all the time!

38:47.504 --> 38:48.829
Afternoon, Fred!

38:52.092 --> 38:53.150
What's brought you here?

38:53.175 --> 38:54.956
Something a little
bird said to me.

38:55.704 --> 38:58.513
Now, shall we eat these pies
while they're still warm?

39:08.317 --> 39:10.183
I looked up what's
been happening

39:10.661 --> 39:12.852
in one of Sister Julienne's
medical books.

39:13.271 --> 39:15.049
Huh! She's a midwife, Fred.

39:15.332 --> 39:17.943
Well, it wasn't a particularly
well-thumbed page.

39:18.866 --> 39:20.389
But it frightened
the life out of me.

39:20.414 --> 39:22.298
I mean, prostrate cancer.

39:22.323 --> 39:23.595
People die of that.

39:24.098 --> 39:28.197
Well, firstly, Fred,
it's prostate, not prostrate.

39:28.710 --> 39:32.567
And secondly, if you're in pain
and struggling to pass urine,

39:32.940 --> 39:35.419
there are plenty of other things
that could be causing it.

39:39.061 --> 39:44.505
Will I have to have, er,
you know... examination?

39:44.691 --> 39:48.408
Yes. But you survived your
Army medicals.

39:48.579 --> 39:50.856
And at least you don't
get shot at if you pass.

39:53.302 --> 39:54.317
Careful!

39:55.049 --> 39:56.049
Sorry, Sister.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.770
Sister Monica Joan, Sister Julienne

39:58.795 --> 40:01.352
said the matter was not to be
discussed further.

40:01.850 --> 40:04.102
You may obey Sister Julienne,

40:04.221 --> 40:05.743
or you may obey me.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.255
I am the elder of we twain,

40:10.421 --> 40:13.437
and the orders I have
given are precise...

40:14.797 --> 40:15.833
..and urgent.

40:20.962 --> 40:22.917
Cath went to live up West.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.719
She was made for up West.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.669
She had the legs,
which I never had.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.700
And the yearning,
which I never had either.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.731
I thought that,

40:37.537 --> 40:39.491
after she got rid of the baby,

40:40.409 --> 40:42.556
after she had to have the operation,

40:43.335 --> 40:44.694
I thought she'd come home.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.523
But she has not.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.385
She said she had to make
what had happened worth it.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.212
She rings me sometimes.

40:58.203 --> 40:59.207
But...

41:00.536 --> 41:05.057
She says every time she sees my
face, she sees that bathroom.

41:12.106 --> 41:13.117
That's right.

41:13.550 --> 41:15.896
Just keep your knees drawn
up as much as possible.

41:16.231 --> 41:17.274
Good man.

41:17.568 --> 41:21.381
The prostate is a gland that
surrounds the neck of the bladder.

41:22.631 --> 41:26.683
It's shaped like a doughnut and
about the same size as a walnut.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.225
If it becomes inflamed,

41:28.250 --> 41:30.703
it can cause all sorts of bother
with your waterworks.

41:31.275 --> 41:32.282
And that's it!

41:35.035 --> 41:36.741
What, that's it, you're finished?

41:36.766 --> 41:37.773
Yes.

41:37.971 --> 41:39.043
Sit up when you're ready.

41:42.603 --> 41:46.367
If there was any sort of growth
or tumour, I'd be able to feel it.

41:47.128 --> 41:48.152
And I can't.

41:50.232 --> 41:51.715
So I haven't got cancer, then?

41:52.101 --> 41:53.181
No.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.474
There is a bit of
generalised enlargement,

41:57.499 --> 41:59.062
probably caused by an infection.

41:59.799 --> 42:01.749
But your urine test
will confirm that,

42:01.837 --> 42:04.378
and I'll prescribe some
penicillin in the meantime.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.208
Thank you, Doctor.

42:14.779 --> 42:18.485
Patrick, May's adoption
has broken down!

42:18.661 --> 42:19.715
What's happened?

42:19.948 --> 42:22.159
The father of the family
has had a relapse,

42:22.184 --> 42:23.486
and they don't feel they're in a

42:23.511 --> 42:25.242
position to give her
the care she needs.

42:25.844 --> 42:28.539
A Hong Kong Project worker
picked her up this morning,

42:28.573 --> 42:30.329
and took her back
to the Mother House.

42:31.034 --> 42:33.633
I don't know what Mother Mildred's
going to say about that!

42:33.658 --> 42:36.339
Mother Mildred's already
called me and said plenty!

42:36.496 --> 42:39.492
Well, have you sufficient
petrol in your car?

42:53.984 --> 42:55.132
Service!

43:01.478 --> 43:02.732
Good evening, ladies.

43:03.587 --> 43:04.960
May I be of assistance?

43:07.498 --> 43:09.514
Our response
is in the affirmative.

43:17.208 --> 43:18.972
Wakey-wakey, little one.

43:19.437 --> 43:20.751
Do you know where you are?

43:21.215 --> 43:22.239
Home.

43:22.670 --> 43:23.739
Hah.

43:36.301 --> 43:37.352
How's that?

44:12.022 --> 44:13.046
Good morning.

44:15.274 --> 44:16.294
Good morning.

44:23.413 --> 44:25.587
I have been kept
apprised of events.

44:25.978 --> 44:28.606
I take it Trixie's still
touching up her lipstick.

44:28.850 --> 44:30.700
She found a ladder in her stocking.

44:32.010 --> 44:33.199
Badges on straight?

44:33.725 --> 44:34.839
Yes, Nurse Crane.

44:36.202 --> 44:37.218
You'll do.

44:39.870 --> 44:41.320
Welcome back, Nurse Crane.

44:41.749 --> 44:44.128
You'll find your Rolodex
is in satisfactory order.

44:44.583 --> 44:45.747
I'll be at court today,

44:46.259 --> 44:48.822
if you might hand out
the morning orders?

44:48.847 --> 44:49.859
Of course.

44:52.172 --> 44:54.147
You're coming with us?

44:54.381 --> 44:56.628
Where would I be,
if not alongside you?

44:56.653 --> 44:58.189
You were born into our hands.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.982
Your trials are ours.

45:17.902 --> 45:21.583
I fear you express
perplexity at our presence.

45:22.852 --> 45:25.293
All will be made plain.

45:44.355 --> 45:45.375
Trixie...

45:47.052 --> 45:48.245
..how's it come to this?

46:02.907 --> 46:04.661
Sister Hilda reckons
she's overdone it.

46:05.129 --> 46:07.271
Maybe she just needs
to stay in and rest.

46:08.609 --> 46:10.116
This looks like anaemia.

46:10.497 --> 46:12.552
Oh, well, then, she can
have a blood transfusion.

46:12.577 --> 46:15.500
She's had loads of them!
I'm not having one today.

46:16.644 --> 46:20.121
If you put me in hospital,
I'll miss the dance.

46:22.602 --> 46:25.425
Miss Franklin, when you
arrived at the Black Sail

46:25.450 --> 46:28.203
with your colleague, Miss Dyer,
what did you see?

46:29.741 --> 46:32.886
I saw a girl I now know
to be Teresa Banley

46:32.911 --> 46:35.125
lying on a table
and bleeding heavily

46:36.020 --> 46:40.010
and a woman I recognised as an
acquaintance standing next to her.

46:40.084 --> 46:42.759
Can you point out that acquaintance
within the courtroom?

46:43.814 --> 46:45.218
I most certainly can.

46:45.652 --> 46:46.744
She's sitting there.

46:48.690 --> 46:49.698
Thank you.

46:50.099 --> 46:53.980
Mr Clementson says he can arrange
for a transfusion today.

46:54.367 --> 46:55.821
I'm ringing for an ambulance.

46:57.928 --> 47:02.302
And I'm not having one if it
means I'll miss the ball!

47:02.795 --> 47:05.719
Poppet, if we can't boost those
red blood cells of yours,

47:05.744 --> 47:07.320
you won't be able to go at all.

47:07.393 --> 47:11.034
They never said
that to Cinderella!

47:16.671 --> 47:19.658
There were rodent droppings
on the floor, as well as blood.

47:20.464 --> 47:23.533
And I remembered that Mrs Dyer
suffers

47:23.558 --> 47:25.380
from an infectious skin condition.

47:26.699 --> 47:28.234
Just a few months ago,

47:28.570 --> 47:31.417
a young Poplar woman
had an abortion,

47:31.442 --> 47:34.667
contracted streptococcus
and then died.

47:35.322 --> 47:36.479
She was called Jeannie.

47:36.880 --> 47:38.397
And I'm not saying her whole name,

47:38.422 --> 47:40.724
to protect her widower
and their children.

47:51.658 --> 47:55.039
May I enquire as to how you
became aware of the case

47:55.064 --> 47:56.210
where the young woman died?

47:57.222 --> 47:59.408
Did you perhaps read about it
in the press?

47:59.926 --> 48:01.148
I didn't have to.

48:01.444 --> 48:05.990
I was her Keep Fit instructor
and she became my friend.

48:06.427 --> 48:09.101
You weren't brought here
as Keep Fit instructor today.

48:09.126 --> 48:10.636
You were summoned as a midwife,

48:11.070 --> 48:13.591
to give your impartial, professional
account of events.

48:13.616 --> 48:16.138
And I suggest to you, Miss Franklin,
that by raising the matter

48:16.163 --> 48:18.948
of your late friend as part
of your evidence here in court,

48:18.973 --> 48:20.478
you are not being impartial.

48:20.947 --> 48:22.751
And you're not being
very professional either.

48:24.593 --> 48:26.764
I don't know how they're supposed
to make people better

48:26.789 --> 48:28.329
when they can't even
send an ambulance!

48:30.442 --> 48:32.150
I'm going to drive
her there myself.

48:42.435 --> 48:43.446
Cath?

48:47.009 --> 48:49.314
Too much has gone on
behind closed doors.

48:50.188 --> 48:51.699
I thought I wanted it left there.

48:52.158 --> 48:53.845
But when the Sisters
came to see me,

48:54.106 --> 48:56.201
I realised other people want more.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.040
Now you do everything
they tell you.

49:06.065 --> 49:08.282
The paint on those shoes will
be dry when you get home.

49:13.970 --> 49:15.791
No, no, no, Ena!

49:16.775 --> 49:19.804
She'll be back. She will be back.

49:21.234 --> 49:22.987
She won't be back for ever.

49:23.309 --> 49:25.822
She won't be back to live
any kind of normal life.

49:26.124 --> 49:28.022
She won't be back to live any
life at all!

49:28.047 --> 49:29.055
I know.

49:30.557 --> 49:32.363
Sh-sh-sh.

49:32.905 --> 49:36.074
Can you point out the person
you engaged to carry out

49:36.099 --> 49:37.652
the procedure in question?

49:44.487 --> 49:46.086
Now tell us, in your own words,

49:46.111 --> 49:48.724
the outcome of your
experience at her hands.

49:49.656 --> 49:51.066
I got an infection.

49:52.472 --> 49:53.476
A fever.

49:54.604 --> 49:56.225
I had to have a hysterectomy.

49:56.250 --> 49:59.597
She'd damaged my womb with
whatever it was she used.

50:00.303 --> 50:01.369
I never saw it.

50:01.672 --> 50:03.147
I only know that it was sharp.

50:10.948 --> 50:14.161
I've got a scar on my stomach
that's ten inches long.

50:15.302 --> 50:17.016
Goes all the way up to my ribs.

50:17.382 --> 50:18.710
The surgeon did that.

50:18.735 --> 50:19.821
He had to.

50:19.846 --> 50:24.092
But every time I look at it in
the mirror, I think of her.

50:26.179 --> 50:27.968
Every time I look in a pram,

50:29.062 --> 50:31.925
every time I think about the way
I nearly ran up those stairs

50:31.950 --> 50:33.404
into that backroom, thinking,

50:33.859 --> 50:36.727
"This is my way out of the shame
and the disgrace of it,"

50:37.317 --> 50:38.537
I think of her.

50:39.290 --> 50:41.326
And how I thought
that she was saving me.

50:41.906 --> 50:45.192
Didn't seem such a lot of
money, seven pounds.

50:47.551 --> 50:49.230
But it's a price
I'll never stop paying.

50:52.313 --> 50:54.703
And that concludes the case
for the prosecution.

50:54.704 --> 50:56.764
No further witnesses will be called.

51:10.443 --> 51:11.454
Valerie...

51:12.132 --> 51:13.479
..you don't have to testify.

51:13.963 --> 51:15.783
w.., why? What's happened?

51:16.816 --> 51:20.836
Your Honour, I have now received
fresh instructions from Mrs Dyer

51:20.861 --> 51:22.286
in relation to her original plea.

51:22.311 --> 51:25.714
May I ask that the indictment
be put to her again?

51:27.220 --> 51:28.222
Very well.

51:28.603 --> 51:29.737
Mrs Dyer.

51:31.215 --> 51:32.358
What do you plead?

51:34.097 --> 51:35.180
Guilty.

51:36.052 --> 51:39.974
- That's bloody criminal!
- Order! Order!

52:10.960 --> 52:12.268
Six years, Val...

52:17.511 --> 52:18.555
Six years.

52:22.519 --> 52:23.869
It's almost the maximum.

52:25.305 --> 52:27.743
I reckon he took a bit off
for my age.

52:28.398 --> 52:30.709
The light in there
was very unbecoming.

52:40.137 --> 52:41.735
I'm sorry.

52:42.136 --> 52:43.661
It's not your fault.

52:44.473 --> 52:45.996
It isn't anybody's fault.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.719
This is the way the world works -

52:49.360 --> 52:50.523
a toss of a coin

52:51.377 --> 52:53.476
deciding whether you get
what you want,

52:54.301 --> 52:55.759
or what you deserve.

52:56.592 --> 52:58.491
You don't deserve
six years, Gran.

52:59.398 --> 53:00.535
Good of you to say.

53:02.932 --> 53:04.560
According to my solicitor,

53:05.147 --> 53:08.799
there are 44 prisoners in
my line in Holloway alone.

53:10.220 --> 53:13.035
I don't reckon I'll be
getting stuff chucked at me.

53:14.017 --> 53:15.624
Women came looking for you.

53:16.244 --> 53:17.997
Women paid you. I know that.

53:19.505 --> 53:21.035
And you know what else?

53:24.717 --> 53:28.868
Until you girls, with all your
training and all your learning,

53:29.044 --> 53:31.739
sort something out with
the men who make the law,

53:32.272 --> 53:34.206
there'll be names
being whispered

53:34.879 --> 53:36.713
and money changing hands

53:36.738 --> 53:39.129
in every backstreet in England!

53:39.471 --> 53:42.779
Because when lives go wrong,
we can put them right.

53:44.002 --> 53:46.036
I can't put mine right, not now.

53:46.495 --> 53:48.270
Maybe it doesn't matter.

53:48.295 --> 53:50.129
Maybe it's for the best.

53:51.321 --> 53:52.369
One way or another...

53:53.874 --> 53:55.874
..we're all just crying
for the moon.

54:17.121 --> 54:19.703
Ladies, if you'll
allow me to say so,

54:20.207 --> 54:22.708
you all look absolutely spectacular.

54:34.416 --> 54:37.095
Although I think I preferred
you in your petticoat.

54:48.838 --> 54:50.723
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:50.724 --> 54:55.602
I'm delighted to welcome you all
to the Ballroom of Hope tonight.

54:56.183 --> 54:59.269
As the money you're so very
kindly helping us to raise

54:59.294 --> 55:02.457
will be going towards
a brand-new incubator

55:02.482 --> 55:04.084
for our maternity home,

55:04.294 --> 55:06.330
Dr Turner will be announcing

55:06.355 --> 55:08.495
most of the speciality
numbers this evening.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.873
However, the very first dance

55:10.898 --> 55:14.143
is one in which he will
be taking part himself.

55:14.817 --> 55:19.257
So I am inviting you
to take your partners

55:19.282 --> 55:21.566
for the Fathers and Daughters Waltz!

55:27.727 --> 55:31.703
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

55:31.704 --> 55:33.736
Yes, you may, Dad.

56:17.737 --> 56:21.180
Gathered together,
we find our light.

56:22.140 --> 56:26.058
And each spark shifts
and multiplies,

56:26.083 --> 56:29.486
scattering its radiance
on our ordinary lives.

56:29.770 --> 56:33.907
Like everything precious,
more valuable when shared.

56:34.793 --> 56:38.719
Like every common miracle,
made of the stuff of stars.

56:39.989 --> 56:41.038
Hello, Jane.

56:41.063 --> 56:42.140
Hello, Reggie.

56:42.843 --> 56:43.846
Your favourite.

56:44.441 --> 56:45.471
Yes.

56:47.890 --> 56:49.587
Let the light shine.

56:49.708 --> 56:52.618
Watch for it falling
on each other's faces.

56:53.708 --> 56:56.188
Count the beams, catch them,

56:56.660 --> 56:58.561
let them be reflected back.

56:59.674 --> 57:02.791
See the hope, see the promise.

57:03.674 --> 57:07.078
Never hide your fears in silence.

57:08.470 --> 57:10.577
Listen to those you cherish.

57:11.172 --> 57:12.715
Hold them in your arms.

57:13.649 --> 57:15.673
Let them hear your heart.

57:18.388 --> 57:21.703
Tell your truth. Tell your story.

57:22.845 --> 57:24.751
Tell your love.
