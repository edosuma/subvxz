not even our parents.

- And his.

28:29.273 --> 28:31.742
And now you.

28:31.809 --> 28:35.143
This is some weird family
practical joke, right?

28:35.212 --> 28:37.977
Constantly.

28:41.285 --> 28:44.220
You know when Liz and I
robbed that convenience store?

28:44.288 --> 28:46.985
We were after an alien spaceship
hidden in the basement.

28:47.057 --> 28:49.617

she's alien too.

28:49.693 --> 28:52.128

a perfectly normal, healthy, happy marriage.

It wasn't such a good idea.

29:31.568 --> 29:34.629

31:51.474 --> 31:53.704
- Vacation.
- What?

31:53.776 --> 31:57.178
Yeah. Isabel did such a good job describing
the place, and we had some free time, so-

31:57.246 --> 31:59.908
- Cut the crap. What's going on?
- We gotta go.

31:59.982 --> 32:02.041

Wait, wait.

- I don't think so.

<i>[ Kivar]
Oh, Zan, it's been a long time.</i>

34:04.607 --> 34:06.541
I wondered about this moment...

34:06.609 --> 34:09.271
when our paths would cross again.

34:09.344 --> 34:13.282
- We are not letting you take Isabel.
- I'm not taking anyone.

Let us leave. Please.

34:26.362 --> 34:30.525
Don't make her kill you again.
It would feel redundant.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.034
- She wouldn't.
- She did before.

34:33.101 --> 34:35.331
No, she didn't.

34:35.404 --> 34:37.235
<i>I remember some of it.</i>

34:37.306 --> 34:40.241
You let Kivar into the city
with his men...

34:40.309 --> 34:43.404
but he convinced you
that he wanted peace.

34:43.478 --> 34:47.040
He said he wasn't gonna kill anybody,
that he was there to call a truce.

34:47.116 --> 34:49.641
<i>Then once you helped him gain access...</i>

34:49.719 --> 34:52.245
<i>he killed all of us.</i>

34:52.321 --> 34:55.585
You didn't kill us, Isabel.
He did. He betrayed you.

Please talk to me.

37:01.751 --> 37:04.686
Maybe you were
kidnapped by aliens or something.

37:04.754 --> 37:07.280
What happened?

37:08.958 --> 37:10.892
He saved me.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.895
He took on Kivar all by himself,
and then I...

37:13.963 --> 37:16.022
knocked him out.

37:16.098 --> 37:18.226
What'd he see?

37:18.300 --> 37:20.962
Everything.

- W-Was he-
- A very dangerous man.

I think he drugged us...

38:05.281 --> 38:07.272
