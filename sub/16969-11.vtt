Hey, guys, what's up?
SO glad you're here

07:35.188 --> 07:38.091
'cause I wanted to invite you
to this sweet little open-mic

07:38.125 --> 07:39.359
night I perform at.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.862
I'm kind of
a singer/songwriter now.

No big D.
-[ Laughs ] I beg to differ.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.799

07:45.833 --> 07:47.601
Yeah, I'm gonna be singing
a new little tune to Abbey here.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.170
That is, if you'll
join me on stage, babe?

07:50.203 --> 07:53.140
Oh, babe.
Yeah, of course I will.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.877
What is this I'm hearing
about an open microphone?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.445
-Principal Quinn.
-Oh! God!

07:58.478 --> 07:59.547
Yeah, Bryce
from last year.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.448
Yeah, I-I remember.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.450
Just haven't seen you
since your hilarious

08:03.483 --> 08:05.118
life-ruining prank.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.520
Yeah, but I thought
it'd be awesome if you came

08:06.554 --> 08:08.956
to the open-mic night.
Oh!

08:08.989 --> 08:11.124
You think the guys from
Beard Science would show up?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
Well, probably not.
They're touring in Europe

08:13.193 --> 08:14.628
right now with
Nathaniel Rateliff,

08:14.662 --> 08:17.030
but, you know,
I've been doing some solo stuff

08:17.064 --> 08:19.399
called Solitary Quinn-finement,
you know?

08:19.432 --> 08:20.634
That could be kind of a --

08:20.668 --> 08:22.335
Are you guys going
to the open microphone?

08:22.369 --> 08:24.004
No, I would never be
caught dead at --

08:24.037 --> 08:26.640
Actually, yes. We're all going
to the open mic.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.508
Matter of fact,
there's no place we'd rather be.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.810
Well, cool, I can't wait
to see you guys there.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.613
It really means a lot to me.
-Oh, yeah, I bet it does.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.885
Man, I can't believe you're
gonna go to that coffee shop.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.521
Open your eyes, Shoemaker,
Bryce is clearly laying a trap,

08:41.555 --> 08:43.924
and Abbey's in on it
just like last year.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.559
That duplicitous shrew.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.860
This performance

08:46.894 --> 08:48.862
at the coffee shop,
that's just a cover, man.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.330
So wait,
you're saying that's

08:50.363 --> 08:51.832
where the prank
is gonna take place?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.166
Uh, doihickey.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.568
But now that we know,

08:54.602 --> 08:56.770
that's our opportunity
for that preemptive strike.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.940
Right, 'cause the one place
they won't expect to be pranked

08:59.973 --> 09:02.009
is the place
they're pranking us.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.677
Exactly.
And the best part is

09:03.711 --> 09:05.512
we'll get his dad there
to witness

09:05.545 --> 09:07.447
[chuckling]
the whole thing.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.082
Wait,
why's his dad there?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.284
Well, you know how Dads, like,
always hate everything you do,

09:11.318 --> 09:13.186
and they're constantly
disappointed in you and stuff?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.855
It'll be like that.
-Are you all right?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.690
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah. I'm good.

-Really good.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.032
Check out his views
on immigration.

You build a wall,
you keep them all out!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.202
Just put your headset
back on.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.971
Yeah, if we're gonna
do this the right way,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.806
we're gonna have to call
in the special ops, bro.

what you're talking about.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.312
He just yelled,
"Keep America for Americans!"

09:39.346 --> 09:41.849
Then he threw
a blueberry at a kid.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.286
You guys came to
the right place.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.321
I used to pull some
pretty hard-core pranks

09:48.355 --> 09:49.723
back in the corps.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.726
Think I have an idea
for "Operation Bryce."

09:52.760 --> 09:54.161
All right, great.
What are we doing?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.563
We're gonna give him
the Kosovo crème brûlée.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.898
All right?
-I like the sound of that.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.834
We do, we took down a lot
of dictators with this one.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.269
Build a trap-door,

10:02.302 --> 10:05.072
meticulously calculated
to that person's weight.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.574
Bryce comes in
and he's the spoon,

10:07.607 --> 10:09.409
and he cracks through
that trap-door.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.578
Boom! Brûlée!
That's what happens right there.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.580
Awesome.
And you know
what he drops into?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.415
Hell, he drops into Hell.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.650
We're Hell.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.086
We bag him,
pillowcase over the head,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.954
zip tie his wrists
and his ankles,

10:20.988 --> 10:22.455
then we behead him.

-That's the prank!

-No, no.
-Okay. I'm on board.

Rod, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.263
I know what you're
gonna say, Shoemaker --

10:30.297 --> 10:31.498
It doesn't have
to be a pillowcase,

10:31.531 --> 10:33.000
it can be any type of bag.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.802
No. Actually, it's not
about the pillowcase.
Help me out here.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.437
The first part
of the plan I'm on board for.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.439
The trap-door,
aw, that works great.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.441
Second half, oof,
not sold on.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.943
Could we workshop it
a little bit?

Yeah, you pussies tinker
around all you want.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.846
It's not getting
funnier than this.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.148
Okay. Have you guys heard
of a little indie flick

10:48.181 --> 10:49.616
called "Ocean's Twelve"?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.651
-The prequel to
"Ocean's Thirteen"?
-The very same.

we're gonna do.

to scare you off.

to you about something, too.

more serious than mine.

recap the plan.

on logistics, right?

Now, the front door to Mutiny,
that's got an alarm on it.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.368
But the back door, that's
a totally different story.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.736

back-door Rod.

they call you back-door Rod.

they call you back-door Rod.

the fun starts, okay?

Now, there's gonna be
motion sensors and cameras.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.714
I'm gonna disarm
those first.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.483
Then, are you guys
ready to laugh?

12:30.517 --> 12:34.087
Because this is where
I plant the rubber baby doll

with six pounds of black powder
