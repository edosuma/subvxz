AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.631 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:13.097
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.181 --> 00:18.686
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.770 --> 00:21.189
stepped forth to oppose me.

where my evil is law.

Now the fool seeks to return
to the past
