WEBVTT

00:02.435 --> 00:03.879
All right, he's a 6.

00:04.837 --> 00:07.090
Oh, totally a 6.
Yum!

00:07.689 --> 00:08.598
Oh, he's a 7.

00:08.629 --> 00:10.928
No way!
5 1/2, tops.

00:10.955 --> 00:13.680
Ouch! Okay,
that's harsh, right?

00:13.746 --> 00:15.389
No, that's what I like about it.

00:15.882 --> 00:16.756
Okay.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.052
He's a 10.
I mean, look at him.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.354
Eww, dude, a 10?!

00:22.421 --> 00:24.089
Like, get away!

00:24.140 --> 00:26.108
I can't believe
you're into that.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.227
I hope he's, like,
seven inches max.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.229
Inches? I thought we were
rating them on hotness.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.530
I thought we were
rating them on dick size.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.599
Why would we be rating
them on dick size?

00:33.666 --> 00:36.034
Abbi, why wouldn't we be
rating them on dick size?

00:36.102 --> 00:38.403
It's all I can see.

00:38.454 --> 00:40.239
Those b-ball shorts
are God's gift.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.828
If you train your eyes,
you can see their religion.

I've never been to
a restaurant this nice.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.052
I've never even worked at
a restaurant this nice.

01:35.545 --> 01:38.430
I read their molten lava
cake is "life-changing."

01:38.497 --> 01:40.098
Perfect for your birthday.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.934
Oprah says that your
birthday dictates

01:42.001 --> 01:43.685
the kind of year
you're about to have.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.805
I haven't eaten a thing
in the past 36 hours

01:46.856 --> 01:49.691
in order to be able to,
like, really stuff myself

01:49.776 --> 01:52.110
with as much expensive
food as possible.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.529
It's gonna raise my
market value, like, so much.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.232
I'm gonna have a high
high-end year.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.484
I've been overeating this week

01:59.535 --> 02:01.370
and then emptying
myself with laxatives.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.955
It's been working really well.

02:03.022 --> 02:03.989
Too well.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.374
My underwear
is filled--

02:05.458 --> 02:07.025
Good evening, mademoiselles.

02:07.076 --> 02:09.461
Hi.
Enchante, uh, monsieur.

02:09.527 --> 02:12.381
My dad--
my father figure

02:12.465 --> 02:15.677
has made a reservation
under Abbi Abrams for two.

02:16.035 --> 02:18.670
I believe his payment card
should be on file.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.682
We are on celebration...

02:21.674 --> 02:23.141
for my birthday.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.189
Oh, how wonderful.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.561
May I take your coats?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.348
Please... do.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.716
Here you go.

02:31.768 --> 02:34.603
Would you care to keep
your jacket, Madame?

02:34.687 --> 02:36.554
It looks like you may be cold.

02:36.606 --> 02:37.722
I'm perfect.

02:37.774 --> 02:38.941
Loving the temp.

02:40.642 --> 02:42.003
You look amazing.
You look amazing.

02:42.028 --> 02:42.995
Stop it.
Give me a spin.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.396
I feel amazing.
Give me a spin.

02:44.447 --> 02:46.331
Oof! Oof! Love it.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.668
So, uh, I know that B-Z,
Beyonce and Jay-Z,

02:49.735 --> 02:51.403
ate here recently,

02:51.454 --> 02:53.038
and, um, we would really love

02:53.089 --> 02:54.673
to be seated at their table.

02:54.740 --> 02:55.874
Of course you would.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.761
I like him.
Yeah.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.098
So, where did, um, Beyonce sit

03:03.182 --> 03:05.434
and where did Jay sit exactly?

03:05.518 --> 03:09.187
Uh, yes,
Ms. Knowles sat here

03:09.255 --> 03:11.256
and Mr. Carter
sat here.

03:11.307 --> 03:13.442
Do you freak out when
celebrities come in here?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.861
Yes. That's why
I love my job.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.396
Enjoy your meals.
Thank you.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.617
Oh, wait! Are--
Are you Beyonce or Jay-Z?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.102
Part of me feels like
I would be Jay-Z,

03:24.153 --> 03:26.771
but then I know that you would
maybe want to be a dude.

03:26.823 --> 03:28.073
You're right.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.575
And Beyonce and I do
have similar curves.

03:30.626 --> 03:31.943
Oh, yes.
You're B, I'm Jay.

03:31.995 --> 03:32.831
I'm Jay.

03:34.328 --> 03:36.281
Hello.
My name is John.

03:36.332 --> 03:37.165
I'll be your server tonight.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.467
Hi, John.
Hi, John.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.385
I understand you lovely
ladies will be having

03:40.453 --> 03:42.681
the seafood prix
fixe dinner this evening.

03:42.726 --> 03:44.622
Excellent. Before we
get started,

03:44.674 --> 03:46.725
are there any food allergies
you'd like me to know about?

03:46.792 --> 03:49.261
Yeah, peanut allergies
are a really big deal.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.645
You gotta be careful,
they can be so fatal.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.631
Gluten, which I think
is like an adult human thing

03:53.683 --> 03:55.233
across the board--
No.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.319
I actually meant if you
have any food allergies

03:57.403 --> 03:58.524
you'd like me to know about.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.609
No, none that I, uh,
want to share with you.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.112
Well, allow me to tell you
about our first course.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.031
It is a local pureed chard

04:09.115 --> 04:10.815
that is topped with poached crab

04:10.867 --> 04:13.368
and then splashed with
a really yummy ramp dressing.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.819
I love yummy ramps.

04:14.871 --> 04:16.671
Oh, I love, um, chards.

04:16.755 --> 04:17.916
We like to say here that ramp

04:17.923 --> 04:19.577
is the truffle of onions.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.094
It's a dumb little joke.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.296
We like to say that, too.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.514
That's funny.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.099
Now have you guys
been to Octavia before?

04:27.166 --> 04:29.134
No, we are poppin' our cherry.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.352
Wow.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.876
Well, you just let me
do the driving.

04:31.888 --> 04:33.023
I'm gonna take excellent care

04:33.023 --> 04:33.940
of you guys tonight.

04:34.273 --> 04:35.275
Okay.
Once again...

04:35.275 --> 04:38.527
je m'appelle John,
and bonne anniversaire.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.613
Oh, thank you.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.730
Wow.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.865
He's tall and he's bilingual?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.867
I'm short and I can't
speak English good.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.319
He probably has a French press

04:47.370 --> 04:49.204
and one of those things
that in the bathroom

04:49.288 --> 04:50.448
you clean your butthole with.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.124
Oh, a bidet.
A bidet.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.575
He's so classy.

04:53.659 --> 04:54.826
Totally.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.461
You're bad-mouthing me
to Anton now?

04:56.529 --> 04:58.029
You cannot find one minute

04:58.081 --> 04:59.631
to go pick my sister up
at the airport?

04:59.698 --> 05:00.966
Tell her fat
ass to flag down a cab

05:01.033 --> 05:01.739
like a person.

05:01.739 --> 05:03.335
My sister is
an ex-junkie, John, okay?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.242
She needs someone to
pick her up,

05:04.242 --> 05:07.005
she can't be unsupervised.
Jesus Christ, she's a grown woman.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.308
She can't be babysat
her whole life, Cheryl.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.851
Well, thank you so much
for the support.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.593
Support? Tell her to give
back the laptop she stole.

05:11.677 --> 05:12.877
She never stole that!

05:12.929 --> 05:14.045
You have no proof that she--
Are you kidding me?

05:14.097 --> 05:15.564
You need to wake up.
What? You're crazy.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.215
I don't know that she gave
us bedbugs for sure,

05:17.266 --> 05:18.235
but I'm pretty damn positive.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.768
This is why I wanted
you to go to Al Anon.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.654
Salmon, we got onion rings,
we got a gumbo.

05:22.721 --> 05:24.322
How's the steak doing?

05:24.390 --> 05:26.618
Every once in a while,
I like a finger.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.094
Amen.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.205
Nose, vagina, butthole.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.064
If God didn't want us to
put our fingers in there,

05:33.116 --> 05:35.784
then why did She make them
perfectly finger-sized?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.285
Exactly, that's
what they're for.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.630
And here's your
amuse-bouche.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.049
Enjoy, ladies.

05:42.127 --> 05:44.426
Your 26th year is
starting off so badass

05:44.510 --> 05:45.577
it is blowing my mind.

05:45.628 --> 05:46.711
It is, right?

05:46.762 --> 05:50.098
I had slightly
above-average sex last night,

05:50.183 --> 05:53.268
which for me, you know,
is incredible sex.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.553
For most.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.484
You know what?
To Doug.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.584
For turning you out.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.776
I planned it so that
we were doing it

06:01.861 --> 06:05.864
at the stroke of midnight,
as I turned 26.

06:05.931 --> 06:07.199
You have given yourself a truly

06:07.266 --> 06:09.117
spiritual sexual experience.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.205
You know, I just feel,
like, really good inside.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.771
You know what?
I gotta pee.

06:13.823 --> 06:14.833
I'll be right back.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.294
And how is everything so far?

06:19.378 --> 06:20.629
So delicious.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.998
I just want to thank you
for your service

06:23.082 --> 06:25.800
and your joie de, uh...

06:25.885 --> 06:26.801
jooge.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.170
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.638
Ours, too, as well.

06:32.124 --> 06:34.309
Mmm. So soft.

06:49.692 --> 06:52.996
I just peed out a condom.

06:56.699 --> 06:59.000
Clams Persimmico
in a gold leaf glaze.

06:59.068 --> 07:00.235
Bon appetit.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.871
Thank you so much.
This looks incredible.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.043
May I grab you another fork?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.790
This is perfect, thank you.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.944
Well, hello,
my fancy girl--

07:09.011 --> 07:11.139
No, don't, I'm not fancy,
I'm disgusting.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.515
I went to the bathroom,
and then--

07:13.582 --> 07:15.310
and then I was
going to the bathroom,

07:15.522 --> 07:17.812
and then a condom
fell out of me.

07:20.756 --> 07:22.090
Did you pee it or poop it?

07:22.141 --> 07:23.485
I peed it.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.059
Why'd you immediately go there?

07:25.061 --> 07:26.111
I didn't poop it, dude.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.279
Hey, it's 2014.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.947
Anal's on the menu.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.699
I can't even believe that,
like, I didn't notice it.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.617
I was, like, very present,
you know?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.142
I don't know how
he didn't notice it.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.320
It happens to everybody.

07:35.404 --> 07:37.207
Has it happened to you?
No.

07:38.331 --> 07:40.575
Everything I've done
has happened to you.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.077
Not yet is what I meant to say.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.005
So what? You're a nasty
bitch, who cares?

07:44.613 --> 07:46.381
All right.
Let's go get high,

07:46.448 --> 07:48.488
and then we can enjoy this
clams Filipino even more.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.720
Okay.
That's a good idea.

07:52.788 --> 07:54.339
Hi, would you mind making sure

07:54.423 --> 07:56.391
they don't take those clams?

07:56.458 --> 07:57.559
Thank you.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.597
You know, I know you're
in your head, but...

08:02.648 --> 08:04.816
this birthday
is a maje improvement

08:04.900 --> 08:06.351
from last year's.

08:06.435 --> 08:07.769
Yeah, well,
I shouldn't have tried

08:07.820 --> 08:09.437
to throw myself
a surprise party.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.049
You should have tried.
It was a mistake.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.658
Hi.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.161
Want a hit?

08:19.749 --> 08:20.815
Thanks for the food.

08:20.866 --> 08:22.627
It's amazingly delicious.

08:23.652 --> 08:24.652
I don't prepare the food.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.037
I just, uh, clear the plates.

08:26.122 --> 08:27.872
Yeah, but... you know.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.529
You know what I've been
thinking about?

08:32.128 --> 08:33.461
Every animal,

08:33.511 --> 08:35.472
from every movie
we've loved as a kid,

08:36.265 --> 08:37.100
probably dead.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.384
Think about it. Air Bud - dead.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.020
All 101 Dalmatians
are probably dead.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.856
I guess Babe
from "Babe" is dead.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.152
Ooh, we could have
eaten Babe tonight.

08:47.676 --> 08:48.810
Well, maybe not.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.278
Pigs live longer than dogs.

08:50.346 --> 08:52.347
I think they might live
longer than humans?

08:52.398 --> 08:53.815
I think that's turtles.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.327
Tramp, from
"Lady and the Tramp."

08:59.764 --> 09:00.874
Tramp's a cartoon.

09:03.359 --> 09:04.626
I know that.

09:04.693 --> 09:06.294
She was for real.
I know that it was a cartoon.

09:06.362 --> 09:08.463
Uh, I gotta go, but thanks.

09:08.530 --> 09:09.697
No worries.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.199
Hey, and I know you
didn't make the food,

09:11.250 --> 09:13.303
but... you will one day.

09:14.057 --> 09:15.580
Uh... thanks.

09:17.539 --> 09:19.674
You know, that Tramp was
my first sexual crush.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.687
He was hot. He was like
a spunky bad boy.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.815
You know who
was mine? Stimpy.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.683
Stimpy from "Ren and Stimpy"?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.935
Yeah, I feel like he has
a similar build to Lincoln.

09:31.020 --> 09:31.821
Huh.

09:59.915 --> 10:02.600
They left your clams.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.970
The world is good, dude.

10:06.055 --> 10:08.356
Ilana, hold on, are you okay?

10:08.424 --> 10:10.308
Your face is like really red

10:10.393 --> 10:12.861
and your eye is blowing up.

10:12.928 --> 10:14.779
Full disclosure:

10:14.864 --> 10:17.732
I'm a little allergic
to shellfish.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.701
That's all we've been
eating tonight.

10:19.768 --> 10:21.269
I really know my body, dude.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.621
I go up to the edge
and then I scale it back.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.573
I'm good at it, honestly.

10:25.624 --> 10:27.659
It looks worse
than it is, I feel great.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.661
How do I not know that
you're allergic to shellfish?

10:29.745 --> 10:31.112
You don't know
everything about me.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.213
I feel like I do.

10:32.254 --> 10:33.774
You text me every time
you take a dump.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.279
I know about the pimple
on your nipple

10:35.284 --> 10:37.085
and I'm, like, the holder
of your Social Security card.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.586
I have mystery, too.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.121
I haven't even told you yet

10:40.172 --> 10:41.956
that I want to put my fist

10:42.007 --> 10:43.842
in our waiter's mouth sexually.

10:43.926 --> 10:46.794
I feel like he only has sex
on top of baby grands.

10:46.846 --> 10:47.679
Oh, my God.

10:47.763 --> 10:49.347
He's so classy.

10:49.432 --> 10:51.065
You know what? Maybe I should
find a girlfriend

10:51.133 --> 10:52.434
who will actually
come see my band play.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.853
John, I told you when we
met that I hate music.

10:54.937 --> 10:56.738
What kind of weirdo
hates music, Cheryl?

10:56.805 --> 10:57.972
Mario, we see you in the corner.

10:58.023 --> 10:59.407
Everybody can tell
that you're stoned.

10:59.475 --> 11:00.204
Don't listen to her, Mario.

11:00.204 --> 11:01.794
Smoke all the weed you want, bro.
How dare you!

11:01.794 --> 11:03.445
Don't forget whose name
is on the lease.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.446
"How dare you?"

11:04.497 --> 11:05.613
You know what? I'll cancel
the cable,

11:05.664 --> 11:06.748
then have fun figuring out

11:06.815 --> 11:08.626
what happens on "Homeland,"
you gross baby.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.586
I need a 42.

11:11.653 --> 11:12.620
I need an onion ring,

11:12.671 --> 11:14.597
I need a tagliatelle
with light sauce.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.261
All right.

11:19.044 --> 11:20.661
Here is the shellfish medley.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.433
I'm really excited
for you guys to try this.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.435
We have crab three ways
and lobster nine ways.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.270
Get in my belly!

11:27.603 --> 11:28.853
You guys are a kick.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.971
Oh, man.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.690
Anyway, like I was saying,

11:32.775 --> 11:34.192
I know I can't really sing.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.729
Mmm, but I feel like if I
had, like, private lessons

11:37.813 --> 11:39.414
and learned how to, like,
really breathe,

11:39.448 --> 11:41.115
then I could, like,
I could sing really well.

11:41.183 --> 11:42.118
Mm-hmm.

11:43.018 --> 11:44.702
But don't repeat that
to anybody.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.538
I won't.

11:47.990 --> 11:49.491
Oh, my gosh.
Ilana, Doug's calling.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.959
Pick it up.
Tell him...

11:51.026 --> 11:53.745
not to leave his trash
inside your body.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.387
I'm gonna.
I'll be right back.

11:56.131 --> 11:57.267
You get it, girl.

12:05.751 --> 12:07.151
I had a really
good time last night.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.376
Yeah, so did I,

12:08.427 --> 12:11.012
until I came
to this really fancy restaurant

12:11.063 --> 12:14.651
for my birthday and I peed
out a condom.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.818
Ohh! What?

12:16.885 --> 12:18.319
Yeah, I know.

12:18.387 --> 12:20.615
Did you not notice that
you were missing a condom?

12:20.615 --> 12:23.074
We didn't use
a condom last night,

12:23.158 --> 12:24.559
so, no, I wasn't keeping track.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.827
What?!
Oh, sorry.

12:25.894 --> 12:27.612
We didn't
use a condom--

12:27.625 --> 12:28.125
I heard you.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.749
What do you mean
we didn't use a condom?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.283
I took it off.
I thought you saw.

12:32.368 --> 12:33.451
No, I didn't see that.

12:33.536 --> 12:34.754
Because, like a lady,

12:35.237 --> 12:37.090
I keep my eyes closed
when I make love.

12:37.456 --> 12:38.716
You're a condom girl.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.842
I will make a note
of that for next time.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.260
There's not gonna be
a next time.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.209
Are you sure, Abbi?

12:45.214 --> 12:46.224
No, I'm not sure,

12:46.224 --> 12:48.351
'cause I'm not sure
about anything.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.229
Something just
fell out of my body,

12:51.891 --> 12:54.188
so I gotta go deal with that,

12:54.256 --> 12:56.391
and you need to deal
with me dealing with that.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.444
Well, you do what
you got to do, girl.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.405
All right, well, maybe
I'll talk to you soon.

13:01.430 --> 13:02.156
You will.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.485
Okay.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.037
Seafood turducken.

13:09.104 --> 13:10.872
We have a small Maine clam

13:10.939 --> 13:12.940
inside the mouth of a lobster

13:12.992 --> 13:14.669
inside a larger Maine clam.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.628
Yum.

13:16.612 --> 13:17.797
Seafood paradise.

13:18.740 --> 13:19.940
All righty.
You know, I'm gonna

13:19.965 --> 13:22.500
suck on those legs
a little longer, so...

13:22.585 --> 13:23.469
Thanks so much.

13:24.987 --> 13:27.422
Oh, my God, Ilana,
your face looks insane.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.059
Hey, this is what living on
the edge looks like.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.894
It's not that bad.
I could still wink, see?

13:37.032 --> 13:38.609
Yeah, this is pretty bad.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.868
But honestly, I know my limit.

13:40.936 --> 13:42.576
I'm just pacing myself
for that lava cake.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.207
Okay, you've absolutely
reached the limit.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.194
Your face looks like
the underbelly of a tugboat.

13:49.111 --> 13:50.128
Listen, we are here

13:50.212 --> 13:52.457
celebrating your birthday, okay?

13:52.457 --> 13:53.541
Yeah, and for my birthday

13:53.541 --> 13:55.883
I would love
for you to stay alive.

13:55.951 --> 13:58.002
Abbi, I am a veteran
of this game.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.671
I got three to
three and a half servings

13:59.755 --> 14:01.716
of shellfish left in me.
I feel it.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.058
And then my throat's
gonna start to close up

14:04.126 --> 14:05.310
and you'll just stab me
with an epi pen.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.187
It's not a big deal.

14:06.187 --> 14:07.562
Where am I getting an epi pen?

14:07.629 --> 14:08.639
From my clutch.
Durr!

14:10.065 --> 14:12.560
So you planned on having me
stab you with an epi pen?

14:12.968 --> 14:14.688
You know, stop trying
to change the subject.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.355
What did Doug say to you
on the phone?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.607
Okay, so, it turns out that, um,

14:19.658 --> 14:22.026
he wasn't wearing
a condom last night.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.111
What?!

14:23.162 --> 14:24.362
It had to have been the condom

14:24.413 --> 14:25.990
from the other night
with boring Ben,

14:27.533 --> 14:29.160
which means that...

14:30.452 --> 14:34.255
there was a condom
in my person for four days.

14:34.322 --> 14:37.324
Normally, I would be overjoyed

14:37.376 --> 14:39.844
that you had sex
twice in one week.

14:39.928 --> 14:41.629
Okay, I could have sworn
that he was--

14:41.680 --> 14:43.174
You could have sworn what?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.800
Not only are we
talking STDs here,

14:45.851 --> 14:48.102
I can't even imagine
how many dudes

14:48.170 --> 14:51.338
would love to lock you down
with an unexpected pregnancy.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.840
I mean,
what do you think--

14:52.891 --> 14:55.693
All right,
the Alaskan king crab stew.

14:55.778 --> 14:57.862
And I do hope
you ladies enjoy it.

14:57.946 --> 14:59.530
Thank you so much, John.

14:59.615 --> 15:00.441
Eww.

15:02.684 --> 15:05.653
I mean, your body is a temple.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.405
You've got to respect it.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.956
Ilana, stop, that's enough.

15:09.024 --> 15:10.658
No, enough.
Hey, two more bites. It is so expensive.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.243
Ilana, stop eating--
okay.

15:12.327 --> 15:13.494
We're not doing this anymore.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.662
No, one more, one more.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.047
Come on, take this pen.
Hey!

15:16.131 --> 15:17.364
No, no!
Ilana, take the pen.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.916
Aah! God!

15:19.001 --> 15:20.128
I stabbed myself.

15:20.636 --> 15:23.054
I just stabbed myself!

15:23.138 --> 15:24.090
Whoo!

15:25.841 --> 15:28.553
Adrenaline!

15:29.094 --> 15:32.346
I... could actually
take that pen.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.098
I feel so alive right now!

15:34.183 --> 15:35.316
What's going on?

15:35.383 --> 15:36.651
Ilana, I got you, girl.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.479
It's my birthday,
I'm the king of the world!

15:38.854 --> 15:40.022
Wait, wait.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.441
We'll take those two
molten lava cakes to go.

15:44.226 --> 15:46.360
26, 26!

15:47.613 --> 15:49.030
Yes, thank you,
I need an ambulance

15:49.081 --> 15:50.331
to Octavia restaurant, please.

15:50.398 --> 15:51.565
Why don't you have the ambulance

15:51.617 --> 15:52.938
drop you off
at a mental hospital?

15:53.001 --> 15:54.235
Because you're a crazy person.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.446
I hope you die in your sleep.

15:55.504 --> 15:57.205
I am gonna die because
you're killing me slowly.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.123
Yes, it's an allergic
reaction to seafood.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.426
Speak clearly.
Someone is dying.

16:01.510 --> 16:03.171
Mm-hmm.
Unbelievable.

16:03.762 --> 16:04.962
I'm king of the world!

16:05.047 --> 16:10.017
Abbi, you are the love
of my... life.

16:27.402 --> 16:28.152
Sorry.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.799
Yes.

16:54.429 --> 16:55.646
Ohh!

16:55.731 --> 16:57.014
We got this.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.232
Okay.

17:01.303 --> 17:02.854
You know what I was
thinking about?

17:02.938 --> 17:04.773
I have no clue.

17:05.741 --> 17:07.526
After tonight, I realized

17:07.910 --> 17:10.111
we gotta get back into
our bucket list, dude.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.412
Yes.
We let it go for too long.

17:11.479 --> 17:12.878
I don't want to wait
till we're dead

17:12.915 --> 17:13.865
to actually get to it.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.317
I have them, I'll pull them up.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.367
There's a lot on here.

17:17.452 --> 17:18.703
I think we need
to make some edits.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.121
Why?
What's on there?

17:20.172 --> 17:22.583
Okay, mine - own an elliptical.

17:23.759 --> 17:25.259
Go to a pug farm.

17:25.327 --> 17:28.128
I just want to, like, lay
with, like, a lot of pugs.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.547
You know?

17:29.631 --> 17:31.849
Do heroin under
the aurora borealis.

17:31.934 --> 17:34.268
Okay, so none of those can go.

17:34.336 --> 17:35.302
Good luck editing.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.055
What are some of mine?
Okay.

17:38.186 --> 17:39.476
Make your own Passover Seder.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.728
To be able to squirt.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.779
Hello.
Okay.

17:45.705 --> 17:46.814
To be held in Abbi's arms.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.900
You did that tonight.
Ohh.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.444
You carried me.

17:51.486 --> 17:53.871
Yeah.
Guess I'm pretty strong.

17:53.956 --> 17:54.491
Who knew?

17:54.491 --> 17:55.471
Mr. Rosenberg?

17:55.953 --> 17:58.125
Mr. Rosenberg.
He's not breathing.

17:58.193 --> 17:59.243
Blue team to the ER.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.664
Draw four units
of ACE inhibitors.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.466
Blood pressure dropping.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.968
60 over 30.

18:07.035 --> 18:08.315
One milligram of epinephrine in.

18:09.704 --> 18:10.631
Get the pads.

18:11.139 --> 18:13.217
Paddles charging, clear.

18:14.174 --> 18:15.309
Patient not responsive.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.262
Clear!

18:23.602 --> 18:25.686
Time of death, 2:47 AM.

18:36.331 --> 18:37.832
You know what another
one of mine is?

18:37.899 --> 18:39.667
To be an Asian girl.

18:41.169 --> 18:42.870
To be one?

18:42.921 --> 18:45.256
I mean, if technology
ever allows for it,

18:45.340 --> 18:47.960
I'd actually love
a crack at every race.

18:48.677 --> 18:49.587
Huh.

18:50.578 --> 18:52.173
All right,
I'll add it to the list.

18:53.630 --> 18:54.591
I'm just gonna say it.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.469
First night
of my 26th year--

18:56.768 --> 18:59.180
pee out a condom,
go to the hospital.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.205
I think that that means that this
year is just gonna be really--

19:01.273 --> 19:02.266
Fun and cool and fresh?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.060
Well, I was gonna say
awesome, but yeah.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.145
Okay, it will be, except

19:07.045 --> 19:10.858
I will be imposing
the strictest condom policies.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.218
From now on, you will be
sending me a picture

19:14.286 --> 19:17.531
of every dick that
you are about to... host

19:18.123 --> 19:20.201
wearing a condom.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.036
Deal?
No deal.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.761
Oh, my God.

19:23.812 --> 19:26.314
Do you know who's at the top
of my mom's gross sex list?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.042
Howie Mandel.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.401
Wait, your mom has
a gross sex list?

19:30.468 --> 19:31.652
Yeah, my whole family does.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.738
We play this game,
it is hysterical.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.022
Who is the grossest person

19:35.107 --> 19:36.741
you still kind of want
to have sex with?

19:36.808 --> 19:38.192
Oh, okay, well,
mine would--

19:38.277 --> 19:40.244
Mine would obviously--
It just, um, it can't be a cartoon.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.263
Okay. Well...

19:43.448 --> 19:44.141
Okay...

19:45.167 --> 19:47.561
Mmm... O.J.

19:48.954 --> 19:49.939
Yeah, yeah.

19:50.886 --> 19:51.922
Definitely O.J.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.157
Oh, my God!

19:53.208 --> 19:56.210
Dude, in his day,
he was a solid man.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.628
Like, he was a 10.
Oh, he was gorgeous.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.013
He was a 10.
No, no, no.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.777
He was on the cover
of magazines and stuff.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.434
I'm just, like, floored by
what a good answer that is

20:03.501 --> 20:05.169
and you've never
played this before.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.388
I have never even
thought of a murderer.

20:07.472 --> 20:08.973
Okay, how about you?

20:09.024 --> 20:13.611
Okay, my last one
was, uh, David Blaine.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.730
David Blaine?!

20:15.814 --> 20:17.514
That's so gross, but I feel like

20:17.566 --> 20:19.700
he cuts off
his breathing so much

20:19.785 --> 20:21.319
he's gotta be uninhibited.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.820
He would let me do anything.

20:22.871 --> 20:24.521
Yeah, he would, like,
pull out a tooth or something.

20:24.573 --> 20:26.093
Anything you want
to do to David Blaine

20:26.101 --> 20:26.601
he'll let you do.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.359
I'd, like, penetrate him.

20:28.410 --> 20:32.663
But my newest one is,
um, the Six Flags guy.

20:33.915 --> 20:35.532
He's like--
Right off the bus?

20:35.584 --> 20:37.027
Yeah, he's like...

20:37.636 --> 20:38.863
No way, he's like...

20:40.722 --> 20:43.174
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you can do that in heels.

20:43.225 --> 20:44.642
But, like, a lot faster.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.311
He does that with his arms.

20:48.897 --> 20:50.166
He's, like, so rubbery.

20:51.549 --> 20:52.650
Hold up, though, dude.

20:52.717 --> 20:54.545
We've got
to go back to O.J.
