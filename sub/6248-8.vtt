<i>- # [Ends]
- [Sirens Wailing]</i>

00:29.896 --> 00:31.830
<i>[Brennan]
So who do they think the body is?</i>

00:31.898 --> 00:34.332
[Booth] A federal prosecutor
who disappeared five years ago...

00:34.401 --> 00:37.336
the day before he was
starting a mob trial.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.339
- Five years? So there's not much left of him.
- Yep.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.342
That's why they flew you
to Sin City, Bones.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.810
<i>They call this America's playground?</i>

00:47.881 --> 00:50.816
We're 15 miles outside Vegas, Bones.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.909
This is America's frying pan.

00:52.986 --> 00:56.444
No kidding. A person can melt
before finding a body anywhere near here.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.617
Once the mob makes
a federal prosecutor disappear...

00:59.692 --> 01:01.557
they kinda want him staying that way.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.528
- Agent Booth.
- Agent Zhang.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.587
<i>Dr. Brennan, thanks for coming.</i>

01:05.665 --> 01:09.601
May 20, 2001. Mason Roberts was supposed
to deliver a keynote address at U.N.L.V.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.832
<i>But he never showed. Found his car three
blocks from his office, engine still running.</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:15.704
- Right this way.
- What? No leads until now?

01:15.775 --> 01:17.709
Leads don't mean much without a body.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.712
Then yesterday we get this tip from
this call girl working at the Tangiers Hotel.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.183
Oh, so I dragged out one of the top forensic
anthropologists across the country, huh...

01:25.251 --> 01:27.185
on the word of a prostitute?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.188
- But what difference does her profession make?
- I'm backing you up.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.190
- You were judging.
- I wasn't judging.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.692
- Yeah. Your voice was judging.
- I had your back.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.026
Anyway, the body's right where
she said it'd be... mile marker 15.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.192
<i>[Brennan]
Confirm victim is male, late 30s.</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:43.792
No clothing, no personal artifacts.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.737
Hey, this informant of yours,
any chance I can talk to her?

01:46.806 --> 01:49.866
As long as you don't expect her to talk back.
She died this morning. Cancer.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.571
It was a deathbed confession.
She was still scared as hell.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.840
<i>Multiple fractures to the skull
and upper extremities...</i>

01:54.914 --> 01:58.042
caused by something cylindrical,
like a pipe or a bat.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.643
Straight out of Capone's playbook.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.156
<i>- I'll know more once I compare
dental records, but...
- [Bird Squawking]</i>

02:04.224 --> 02:07.318
What, Bones?

02:08.995 --> 02:12.089
<i>It's a vulture. Dead body here.
Kinda how it works.</i>

02:12.165 --> 02:15.328
They don't circle skeletal remains.
Get my bag.

02:21.241 --> 02:25.678
<i>Oh, right. It's the sun-baked,
rotting corpses they're into.</i>

02:25.745 --> 02:27.804
<i>[Brennan]
It's a female, mid-20s.</i>

02:27.881 --> 02:30.577
<i>Similar injuries to the male victim...</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:33.676
but this is a fresh kill...
a week to 10 days.

02:33.753 --> 02:35.687
Popular dumping ground for these guys.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.848
You don't mean the same guys
five years later?

02:37.924 --> 02:41.291
Well, if they're not connected,
it'd be one hell of a coincidence.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.057
I'd have to compare them
side by side...

02:44.130 --> 02:47.861
but, from what I see here, whoever
buried that victim buried this one too.

02:47.934 --> 02:52.132
- So, two dead for the price of one.
- Viva Las Vegas.

03:27.640 --> 03:32.134
<i>- [Chattering]
- [Police Radio Chatter]</i>

03:34.547 --> 03:36.481
Yep.
Dental records confirm.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.280
The male victim is Mason Roberts,
bludgeoned to death.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.287
Presumably with a baseball bat.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.414
This guy here looks like
a long-ball hitter.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.357
That's Sweet Pete Arno.
He's the gaming exec at the Tangiers.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.794
He and the other two there,
they were on Roberts's immediate
to-do list when he disappeared.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.455
Any specs on the female victim yet?

03:52.532 --> 03:54.466
Mmm, only preliminary.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.162
Blows to the cranium, torso,
and upper extremities.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.171
All similar injuries to Roberts.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.367
<i>- But the likely result of domestic abuse.
- Likely result?</i>

04:02.442 --> 04:04.501
There's nothing domestic about a mob hit.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.511
But the shape of her injuries...

04:06.579 --> 04:08.843
the pattern of healing and re-breaking...

04:08.915 --> 04:12.544
There's a long history of assault here, Booth,
and not from any baseball bat.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.554
Plus, I found this embedded in her skull.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.058
<i>- Is that a hearing aid?
- They're common with abuse victims.</i>

04:19.125 --> 04:22.652
Repeated blows to the head
can damage the bones of the inner ear.

04:22.729 --> 04:26.495
Sorry to butt in, Brennan,
but I got a name off the serial number.

04:26.566 --> 04:31.162
<i>Hearing aid is registered to a Wilhelmina
Morgan of Mount Charleston, Nevada.</i>

04:31.237 --> 04:33.705
Oh, that's not too far from here.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.709
She goes by the name Billie.
Listed here as Billie Morgan, 26.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.712
Reported missing two weeks ago
by her husband, Donald.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.578
- Her abusive husband covering his tracks?
- Possible.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.414
Okay, he might know how his wife
and Roberts ended up here.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.977
<i>- He may even know your friends here.
- You get on that.</i>

04:49.055 --> 04:52.491
- I'll fly these remains back to theJeffersonian.
- Whoa.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.753
- You can't leave.
- I can't?

04:54.827 --> 04:59.196
No. We came for one body, and suddenly
there's two. What if there's more?

04:59.265 --> 05:02.132
Just ship both sets of remains here,
along with bugs, dirt... the works.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.034
If there's a forensic link to these murders,
we'll find it.

05:05.104 --> 05:08.904
- As long as you keep me in the loop.
- As if we could keep you out.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.068
Okay.
So that's the deal.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.671
Box them up, and we go
break the news to big Don.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.549
And here I thought she left me.

05:20.620 --> 05:25.057
- Why would she do that, Don?
- I got laid off a couple months ago.

05:25.124 --> 05:29.356
Poor Billie. She hated seeing me sitting
around the house all day, depressed.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.262
- Drinking?
- Punching walls?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.892
No. I just... I fell off a ladder.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.697
Breaking a fall like that
would fracture distal radius...

05:37.770 --> 05:39.795
<i>not proximal phalanges.</i>

05:39.872 --> 05:42.363
So I got a police report
that says that your neighbors heard you...

05:42.442 --> 05:44.376
screaming at your wife
three weeks ago.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.572
Screaming?
No. Just arguing.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.649
Billie wanted to help out. She thought
she could bring in some money dancing.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.051
You know, the exotic kind?

05:55.121 --> 05:58.215
- I kind of flipped out.
- And broke your thumb against your wife's face?

05:58.291 --> 06:01.089
No! Look, I could never
hurt Billie, okay?

06:01.160 --> 06:03.151
Then how'd she lose her hearing?

06:03.229 --> 06:07.097
I don't know! She was a kid playing sports.
One too many soccer balls to the head.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.101
- Oh, please.
- Listen, Don, you're my number one suspect.

06:10.169 --> 06:13.468
<i>So it would be wise
if you were straight with us.</i>

06:13.539 --> 06:15.666
Implants.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.306
<i>Breast implants?</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:22.780
She thought they'd help her chances
of landing a job as a dancer.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.808
<i>As much as I hated the idea,
I borrowed eight grand from a loan shark.</i>

06:26.886 --> 06:29.320
Gave the money to Billie.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.415
That's the last time I ever saw her.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.427
- So that's how you broke your thumb.
- Huh?

06:35.495 --> 06:38.487
The loan shark comes to collect his eight grand.
Don here, he can't pay him.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.498
<i>- So...
- Yeah. Now I owe him 10.</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:43.467
I need the loan shark's name.
Just give me a name.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.638
Mackey.
Yeah, that's right. Lewis Mackey.

06:53.713 --> 06:58.616
Yeah. Send his information to my
cell phone as soon as you can. Thanks.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.881
- We had the shark in our system.
- Proving at least that he exists.

07:01.954 --> 07:05.515
You know, Don's story might seem
a little, I don't know, hinky.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.789
- But just keep an open mind.
- To what? All those soccer balls to the head?

07:09.862 --> 07:13.798
I'm just not sold on the whole
domestic abuse thing. A scrawny guy like that?

07:13.866 --> 07:16.391
<i>- Rage has nothing to do with size.
- I know that, Bones.</i>

07:16.469 --> 07:18.403
You know that I know that.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.531
It's just, I looked into the guy's eyes,
and I... I just didn't see it.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.541
What about the breast implants?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.873
If she'd gotten them,
they would've been part of her remains.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.880
Yeah. Well, then the money
had to be for something else.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.475
And hopefully, this guy will be
able to tell us what it was.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.417
<i>[Bells Ringing]</i>

07:35.488 --> 07:37.217
<i>- [Woman Screaming] Yeah!
- Hey.</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:38.882
<i>[Man]
Place your bets.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:42.189
- There's our loan shark. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment here.

07:42.261 --> 07:45.025
<i>- [Man] We've got a winner!
- Color out.</i>

07:45.097 --> 07:48.225
Oh, my God.
I completely forgot.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.701
You can't be here, Booth.
You're a degenerate gambler.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.237
Former gambler, okay?

07:52.305 --> 07:55.934
Not degenerate. I've been through
the program. And he's on the move.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.943
<i>Well, what if you get a sudden urge
to gamble while you're here?</i>

07:59.011 --> 08:02.606
<i>- It's like sending an alcoholic to a distillery.
- [Coins Clattering]</i>

08:02.682 --> 08:05.082
- Do you need to sit down?
- No, I'm fine.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.517
It's just the sound of the winning.
It'll pass.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.680
<i>What?
The sound or the winning?</i>

08:09.755 --> 08:11.689
<i>Just kinda reminds me
of the first time.</i>

08:11.757 --> 08:16.421
I walked into the Desert Inn
with 35 bucks in my pocket
and walked out with a cool 10 grand.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.430
Next night, I lost everything.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.728
Tapped out my A.T.M.
trying to get it back.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.893
<i>- What's that game called again?
- Craps.</i>

08:22.969 --> 08:26.029
- What's the matter now?
- No, it's the game. It's called craps.

08:26.105 --> 08:30.201
This used to be my game, Bones.
Roll dem bones. Chuck the dice, you know?

08:30.276 --> 08:33.268
- Seven-11!
- That's craps.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.644
<i>[Players Groaning]</i>

08:35.715 --> 08:39.412
And he's going for the bar. You stay here.
I know how to talk to these guys.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.977
- Talk? You can barely breathe.
- I'm fine. Just trust me, all right?

08:43.054 --> 08:45.888
- Wait here.
- And do what, exactly?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.620
You're an anthropologist.
Observe the culture.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.719
<i>[Man]
Five dollars, yo.</i>

08:50.796 --> 08:53.492
<i>- [Woman] Come on! Boxcars!
- [Shouting, Cheering]</i>

08:54.734 --> 08:57.134
<i>[Croupier]
Winner, seven! Winner, seven!</i>

08:57.203 --> 08:59.728
Hit me.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.635
Lou Mackey.
Don't I owe you money?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.441
I'm afraid you have me
confused with someone else.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.005
I don't think I do.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.608
My buddy, Don Morgan,
he introduced us...

09:13.686 --> 09:15.654
30, scrawny guy, broken thumb.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.416
Do I need to call Security?

09:17.490 --> 09:20.288
Yeah.
You know, that's a great idea.

09:20.359 --> 09:25.456
Then maybe you can tell all of us what you did
to Don and how his wife ended up dead.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.659
- I don't know anything about any wife.
- Come on, Lou.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.702
Don't make me work so hard here.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.136
Look, the guy owed me money.
He neglected to pay.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.834
Then he fell off of a ladder.
It's instant karma.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.776
Instant karma.
That's gonna get you every time, isn't it?

09:39.845 --> 09:42.871
What about, uh, Billie Morgan?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.883
<i>She have instant karma, too?</i>

09:44.951 --> 09:48.443
She's attractive.
I didn't even know he was married.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.888
How about the name Mason Roberts?
I'm sure that rings a bell.

09:51.958 --> 09:56.122
Whispers on the strip is that
you finally found him. Congratulations.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.789
Now leave me alone.

09:58.864 --> 10:03.062
If you know more than what you're saying,
I'm gonna find out eventually.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.569
- Do I look worried?
- [Chuckles]

10:05.638 --> 10:09.233
I'm a businessman.
What are you harassing me for?

10:09.308 --> 10:11.833
Ah, it's just something
I have about bullies.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.403
Thanks for the drink.

10:16.649 --> 10:20.210
- Nineteen's a winner.
- Yes! Yes.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.313
- Uh, hey, Bones.
- Booth! Have you ever played this game before?

10:24.390 --> 10:28.087
It's basic math. You just count the cards,
and then you know what the dealer has left.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.652
- Yeah. lxnay.
- The most common card is a 10
because of the face cards.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.495
So if you just always assume
that the down card's a 10...

10:34.567 --> 10:37.434
- I'm afraid you're gonna have to...
- We were just about to leave.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.437
- I was just getting good.
- Good at cheating.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.666
- That's what counting cards is.
- It's not cheating. It's strategy.

10:41.741 --> 10:45.404
<i>- Not to them it's not.
- Well, what is the fun in that?</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:48.413
- The odds are completely skewed
in the dealer's favor.
- Now do you see the attraction?

10:48.481 --> 10:52.713
<i>Now, the man on my right, he's going
to win ifhe doesn't hit on an eight.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.353
Aegialia concinna.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.297
- Gesundheit.
- Also known as scarab beetles.

11:07.366 --> 11:10.301
They came from the soil
around Billie Morgan.

11:10.369 --> 11:15.238
These adults feed on putrefied
organic matter, or in this case, Billie.

11:15.307 --> 11:19.539
- As a result, they suffered
unusually short life spans.
- From ingesting Billie's flesh?

11:19.612 --> 11:22.080
More likely,
the powerful glucocorticoid in her system.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.309
I have yet to isolate
which one specifically.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.317
<i>Be sure to notify
Dr. Brennan when you do.</i>

11:26.385 --> 11:29.115
Any specifics on the bat
used to kill Roberts yet, Zack?

11:29.188 --> 11:34.626
Here's a replica. Cincinnati Slugger with
a three-inch diameter weighing about 27 ounces.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.289
You'd think the mob would come up
with less clichéd ways to whack people.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.059
<i>But there's something else.</i>

11:40.132 --> 11:44.068
Staining in Roberts's cranium
indicates seepage to the cervical spine.

11:44.136 --> 11:47.594
So somehow, blood from his head
got down to his neck.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.664
Vertebrae C-7.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.972
- Are those cut marks?
- So his throat was cut too.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.013
<i>Per my scarab beetles, did you find a
specific cause of death on Billie Morgan yet?</i>

11:55.081 --> 11:57.015
She displays a hemothorax
on her left lung.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.983
Caused by a left-sided rib fracture.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.077
A broken rib punctures a lung
causing massive internal bleeding.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.782
And between her pre-existing injuries
and the new ones...

12:04.857 --> 12:07.291
the poor girl
never had a chance to heal.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.691
Oh, won't Dr. Brennan
love to hear that.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.463
<i>[Brennan] Take a closer look
at the stress markers to her sternum, Zack.</i>

12:15.534 --> 12:17.593
They strike you as unusual?

12:17.670 --> 12:21.470
Well, they do seem more the result
of repetitive medium-impact manual blows...

12:21.540 --> 12:23.531
than the single high impact from a bat.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.474
This husband could really dish it out.

12:25.544 --> 12:29.002
Maybe she dished it back.
These hairline fractures on her knuckles...

12:29.081 --> 12:32.380
<i>Defensive wounds.
Wait a minute. Let me zoom in.</i>

12:33.986 --> 12:36.511
<i>Repetitive manual blows,
fractured knuckles...</i>

12:36.589 --> 12:39.524
the glucocorticoid
that killed your bugs, Hodgins...

12:39.592 --> 12:42.083
<i>Could it have been simple cortisone
to treat an injury?</i>

12:42.161 --> 12:43.492
Yeah. It's certainly possible.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.962
What are you thinking, Dr. Brennan?

12:46.031 --> 12:50.161
- I'm thinking Billie Morgan
could've been a boxer.
- Like a real boxer in a ring?

12:50.236 --> 12:53.069
But wouldn't boxing gloves
prevent injuries like these?

12:53.139 --> 12:55.073
Unless she wasn't wearing gloves.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.666
- Well, what boxer does that?
- Ultimate fighters.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.370
Ultimate fighters!

12:59.445 --> 13:02.073
<i>[Chuckles]
You're into that crap too, huh, Hodgins?</i>

13:02.148 --> 13:05.311
<i>Dude, it's barbaric. When it shows up
on cable, I can't turn it off.</i>

13:05.384 --> 13:07.682
- And it's actually legal?
- Completely sanctioned.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.721
They do wear
some protective gear...

13:09.789 --> 13:12.724
<i>which would fly in the face
of our girl's injuries.</i>

13:12.792 --> 13:14.726
- Unless it was underground.
- Underground where?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.024
<i>Come on. Haven't you guys
ever seen Fight Club?</i>

13:17.096 --> 13:20.759
<i>Illegal, no-holds-barred slugfests.
Modern day panem et circenses.</i>

13:20.833 --> 13:23.324
But generally there's no free bread.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.200
- What?
- So Don Morgan didn't beat his wife.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.173
Hate to say I told you so.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.011
Why didn't you tell us, Don?

13:34.079 --> 13:37.173
Because I didn't know.
All right? She never told me.

13:37.249 --> 13:41.515
- Your own wife didn't tell you
that she was fighting?
- Because I'd never let her.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.112
<i>Billie hadn't boxed in a year.</i>

13:44.190 --> 13:47.125
Commission took her license away
when they found out about her hearing.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.684
It about broke her heart,
but she was done.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.889
<i>- Apparently not.
- You know what I think?</i>

13:51.964 --> 13:55.263
I think somebody offered Billie an illegal fight
and you jumped at the chance for a payday.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.826
- Are you out of your mind?
- You borrowed money from Mackey
and you put it all on Billie.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.872
And she ended up paying the price.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.465
- No! That's not true!
- Who are you protecting, Don?

14:03.542 --> 14:06.739
Nobody!
Look, I swear I didn't know.

14:06.812 --> 14:10.043
Don, we can protect you if you let us.

14:10.115 --> 14:14.848
If I knew who killed Billie, I'd tell ya.
Believe me. Please.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.955
- Why would anyone fight illegally
in the first place?
- There's limited options.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.256
Not everybody
can be Oscar De La Hoya.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.263
Who?

14:25.331 --> 14:29.267
Injuries, criminal past, failed drug tests...
leaves them with no other skills.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.498
- So they take on a fight
wherever they can find one.
- Even if it kills them?

14:32.571 --> 14:35.438
- Mmm.
- [Phone Rings, Beeps]

14:35.507 --> 14:36.940
<i>Brennan.</i>

14:37.009 --> 14:39.944
I found something in the particulates
from Billie's shoes.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.946
Traces of hexavalent chromium.

14:42.014 --> 14:45.313
It's a chemical used in high-end
automotive shops specializing in chroming.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.581
Mechanics who use them have to
file reports with the E.P.A.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.588
Ow! What?

14:50.656 --> 14:53.489
- [Brennan] Hey! No gambling!
- Am I interrupting something?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.493
[Booth]
It's just keno, all right?

14:55.561 --> 14:59.258
I'm sorry if Hodgins
lost me at hexavalium chromo...

14:59.331 --> 15:02.664
Hexavalent chromium.
And we need to find some.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.670
How can we contact
the Environmental Protection Agency?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.206
Yeah, I'm on it.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.240
- Whew.
- This was an auto shop?

15:13.312 --> 15:18.147
Yeah. E.P.A., they shut it down months ago
for hazardous waste material.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.152
It was the only shop authorized
to use that chromium stuff.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.154
See it anywhere?

15:23.222 --> 15:26.714
Could be absorbed into
the dust particles on the floor.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.783
Along with flash paper.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.556
- What's that?
- Betting slips.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.189
Burn fast in case there's a raid.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.327
Look at this.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.997
<i>[Booth]
They painted a ring for the fights.</i>

15:40.072 --> 15:44.099
<i>- So this was the fight club.
- If there's blood, I'd say it is.</i>

15:44.176 --> 15:46.167
Where's your, uh, light thingie?

15:50.582 --> 15:52.516
<i>Blood.</i>

15:52.584 --> 15:55.417
The whole place is covered in blood.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.223
Of the 30 blood samples
found in the body shop...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.854
six were A-positive,
same as Billie Morgan.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.693
<i>[Saroyan]
Still waiting on DNA.</i>

16:06.765 --> 16:09.393
30 fighters translates to five two-person
fights per hour over a three-hour period.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.561
Or three fights over five hours,
six fights over...

16:11.637 --> 16:14.231
We get the idea, Zack.
Lots of fights.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.072
I ran thermal imaging on Billie's remaining
soft tissue to reconstruct her injuries.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.442
<i>This is what she might've
looked like after the fight.</i>

16:21.513 --> 16:23.504
Ah, the sweet science.

16:23.582 --> 16:28.042
Just when I get to a place where I can almost
stomach seeing maggots eating intestines, this.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.884
<i>How could anybody
do this to themselves?</i>

16:30.956 --> 16:33.083
In 900 B.C., the Greek ruler Theseus
entertained himself...

16:33.158 --> 16:36.127
watching two men in chairs
beat each other to death.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.323
Just saying, it's nothing new.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.731
<i>I can work up force and velocity readings
for each blow.</i>

16:42.801 --> 16:47.431
Zack can help me I.D. her opponent from
the circumference and diameter of the fists.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.066
I'd rather Zack focus
on our second weapon for Roberts.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.110
None of these blades
are narrow enough.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.136
<i>- It's as if his vertebrae
was cut with a razor blade.
- [Hodgins] Or a razor wire.</i>

17:00.853 --> 17:04.050
Please, someone buy a DVD player.

17:04.123 --> 17:07.684
- You mean a garrote?
- Yes. A garrote pulled so tightly around Luca's...

17:07.760 --> 17:09.318
Or rather Roberts's neck...

17:09.395 --> 17:12.296
It sliced through his throat
and severed his carotid artery.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.992
Okay, the whole
"maggots eating intestines" thing...

17:15.067 --> 17:18.559
<i>is not nearly as gross to me now.</i>

17:18.637 --> 17:20.570
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Thanks a lot.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.574
Agent Zhang said he found the owner
of the old body shop.

17:23.642 --> 17:27.078
He said some guy paid him $3,000 cash
just to use the place for one night.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.080
No names, no questions asked.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.582
- Seems like a theme in this town.
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

17:31.650 --> 17:35.586
Why is he hitting on a 16? I mean, look at him.
He's completely distracted.

17:35.654 --> 17:39.090
Well, you know what? Actually, Bones, you can.
If the face card is show...

17:39.158 --> 17:40.921
All right.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.860
<i>- I don't want to hear it.
- There he is.</i>

17:45.431 --> 17:49.265
- Look at this. It's my buddy, Lou Mackey.
- Great. We're friends now.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.928
I need you to tell me where a fight fan
can get a little, uh...

17:52.004 --> 17:54.472

17:54.540 --> 17:57.134
What are you doing

17:57.209 --> 17:59.541
- Man's got a lot of friends.
- So it would seem.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.671
- I'll catch up with you later, Frankie.
- Hey, Lou.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.978
- See you, friend.
- Is he a problem?

18:05.050 --> 18:07.951
No, no. That's all good.
Hey, look at you.

- I bounce around.

18:18.797 --> 18:22.198
You know, here, Chicago, L.A. You know me,
huh, Seel. Always chasing rainbows.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.292
Good ol' Frankie boy, huh?
How's Karen?

18:24.369 --> 18:28.635
No, no. That's over. You know?
She ran off with some loser stockbroker.

18:28.707 --> 18:32.074
- You know, it's just as well. I don't need that.
- Frankie, you all right?

18:32.144 --> 18:35.875
Don't start with that, huh? It's been
too many years. I'm getting by, all right?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.473
- Yeah. Guys like Lou Mackey?
- Yeah, well, you know, minor...

18:38.550 --> 18:40.541
minor occupational hazard.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.985
- Have you considered medication?
- Oh, Bones!

18:43.055 --> 18:46.752
An antidepressant might raise
your norepinephrine level.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.157
It could help control the impulsivity.

18:49.228 --> 18:53.460
- What are you, a drug rep now or something?
- Excuse us, Bones, okay?

18:55.267 --> 18:58.759
Wondering if you know anything
about these underground fight clubs.

18:58.837 --> 19:02.170
Yeah. Actually, I do know one.
Bare knuckles. No rules.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.175
All right, I need to know where.

19:04.243 --> 19:07.406
It moves around. This guy, Joe Nolan,
he sells 800 numbers.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.381
- You call, you find out the time,
the place, code to get in.
- The old boxerJoe Nolan?

19:11.450 --> 19:15.386

He owns a gym here on Federal.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.547
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, uh...

19:17.623 --> 19:21.957
Think you could spot me a couple of bucks?
Forgot my wallet at the house.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.723
- Yeah.
- Just something, you know? I'll get you back.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.787
Yeah.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.367
Frankie's a better guy
than he seems.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.369
And yet he knows this Nolan guy.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.871
Anybody who knows the fight game
knows Joe Nolan.

19:34.940 --> 19:38.137
The guy he was, you know,
set to be the next Sugar Ray...

19:38.210 --> 19:41.145
until he was accused of
throwing a couple fights.

19:41.213 --> 19:44.478
What? You mean losing on purpose?
Why would anyone do that?

19:44.550 --> 19:48.452
- I should talk toJoe alone.
- What's with this sudden impulse
to leave me behind?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.455
I'll tell you, Bones, the usual rules,
they don't apply here.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.822
The deeper we get, I don't want anyone
knowing that we're F.B.I.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.260

I busted a lace, Joe.

22:10.796 --> 22:15.290
<i>Sorry to bother you, Joe, but you had
a huge impact on my style back in the army.</i>

22:15.367 --> 22:18.302
Juke to the body, followed by a right hook.
Worked for me every time.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.066
Another army fighter, Joe? How many
of these has-beens you get in here a week?

22:21.139 --> 22:25.439
- At least this one still looks like he's in shape.
- My man's in great shape.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.603
- Believe me.
- Easy there, honey.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.705
Well, let's see it, army. Show us
those moves that made you so famous.

22:30.782 --> 22:33.444
Go ahead, tiger.
Show these clowns.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.577
<i>- Yeah, maybe I will. Just a little.
- Come on.</i>

22:35.654 --> 22:37.645
<i>Yeah. Come on, tiger.</i>

22:37.723 --> 22:41.386
Let's see, Joe.
Give it that little, you know, tap.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.453
You know, juke to the body
with a hard right...

22:45.530 --> 22:48.260
followed by
a whole bunch of the old...

22:48.333 --> 22:50.767
[Grunting]

22:53.171 --> 22:56.834
- So much for my "has-been" army fighter.
- Not bad.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.604
- I still got it.
- Yeah. Maybe a little too much.

22:59.678 --> 23:02.806
- What's your name?
- Tony Scalia. Here's my fiancée, Roxanne.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.349
Yeah, we're more engaged
to be engaged.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.352
<i>- You looking to train or what?
- Ah, you know, I don't fight no more.</i>

23:08.420 --> 23:13.380
But they say that you could direct me and Roxie
to a little, you know, underground action.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.618
- They say a lot, don't they?
- Some guy at the Rio.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.689
- One of them "you didn't hear it from me" types.
- Sorry. Can't help you.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.668
<i>What'd I tell you, Tony?
That guy was just trying to hit on me.</i>

23:24.736 --> 23:28.172
<i>But I do know a number you can call.
Not that I give it tojust anybody.</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:30.674
Oh, come on, Joe.
They seem like such nice people.

23:30.742 --> 23:34.109
<i>- Yeah. We're nice people.
- A thousand bucks.</i>

23:34.179 --> 23:36.272
<i>- Each.
- Whoa. That's a little steep.</i>

23:36.348 --> 23:41.843
No, Tony, come on. We only live once.
I want to see a fight.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.689
- Nothing like being a kept man.
- Yeah. Don't know what I'd do without her.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.993
That was amazing.
What got into you?

23:53.064 --> 23:56.659
It's from when I used to watch old movies
with my dad. He really liked Clara Bow.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.703
Clara Bow was a silent film star.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.864
Yeah, but I... I guess that's how
I always imagined she sounded.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.909
Just like you imagined
she carried around a wad of cash?

24:04.976 --> 24:09.242
Oh, that. I couldn't sleep last night,
so I snuck off to play a little crap.

24:09.314 --> 24:12.249
Craps, Bones. Plural.
And I can't believe your beginner's luck.

24:12.317 --> 24:15.081
- Don't say that. You'll jinx it.
- Since when do you believe in jinxes?

24:15.153 --> 24:17.747
I don't. But after hearing
the crap dealer say it...

24:17.823 --> 24:20.656
Crap dealer's right. No jinxes.
We got a big night ahead of us.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.655
<i>All right.
The federal prosecutor here and Billie here.</i>

24:25.730 --> 24:27.664
Both show evidence
of topical chemicals.

24:27.732 --> 24:30.895
This'll extract the elements I need to
cross-reference with the dead beetles...

24:30.969 --> 24:32.766
safely.

24:32.838 --> 24:36.330
Not that she was safe, letting herself
get drawn into a fight like that.

24:36.408 --> 24:40.344
- We've all been in a fight or two
we wish we hadn't.
- Not me.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.575
You've never fought?
Never thrown a punch?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.582
Never saw the logic of it.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.584
It's not about logic.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.779
It's... It's emotional.
It's anger.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.449
I don't get angry.
It's not rational.

24:52.524 --> 24:54.424
What if you were on the beach
and someone kicked sand in your face?

24:54.493 --> 24:57.860
- I don't go to the beach.
- All right, work with me here, Zack.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.056
There has to be something
that would piss you off.

25:00.131 --> 25:04.033
What if I call you a scrawny twit
who can't hold a normal conversation
with a 10-year-old?

25:04.102 --> 25:06.536
I don't have much in common
with a 10-year-old.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.539
And although I don't know
what a twit is...

25:08.607 --> 25:11.075
objectively, I am thin
and lack muscular definition.

25:11.142 --> 25:14.942
- Dude, you're a Vulcan.
And a dull Vulcan at that.
- Can we please work?

25:15.013 --> 25:19.211
Now you're pissing me off. You're a freak, man.
Anger is a part of being human.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.811
- Grow a set.
- I would really like to work, Hodgins.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.324
You know, it is not enough to be
some robotic, second-rate grad student.

25:26.391 --> 25:29.258

And you're gonna be a grad student
the rest of your life because you have no fire.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.095
I'm working on my dissertation.

25:37.168 --> 25:41.161
<i>Oh, please. You've been saying that
for years. You're a poseur.</i>

25:41.239 --> 25:44.800
You don't have your doctorate because you
have no drive, no passion for what you love.

25:53.251 --> 25:55.651
- Dude.
- It's not what you think.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.188
- You got pissed.
- No. Striking you...

25:58.256 --> 26:02.317
merely seemed to be the most practical way
to get you to be quiet and focus on work.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.659
But I didn't realize
how much it would hurt.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.096
- Nice punch though.
- Thank you.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.033
And my dissertation will be finished
by the end of the month.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.866
<i>- Have the chemicals been extracted yet?
- Looks good.</i>

26:13.939 --> 26:17.898

- I'm moving.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.478
<i>[Booth]
It's human cockfighting.</i>

26:57.549 --> 27:00.484

Hey, Tony. Tony!

27:38.256 --> 27:41.225
<i>Sorry, Booth.
I just couldn't have you blowing my cover.</i>

27:41.292 --> 27:44.784
Ah, yeah. And as they taught us
in Quantico, Walt, I wasn't about to.

27:44.863 --> 27:47.730
Do you know everyone in this town?

27:47.799 --> 27:50.893
- I had no idea we had an agent in there.
- I'm on a RICO assignment.

27:50.969 --> 27:53.904
Under deep cover about a month.
Still can't crack who's running the show.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.907
- What do you know aboutJoe Nolan?
- Low-level guy.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.968
One of many buffers. That 800 number
he sells changes with every event.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.879
<i>Trying to track it

Uh, yeah.
It's, uh, Billie-something, right?

28:09.120 --> 28:13.079
Yeah. Four-to-one underdog.
Oh, she whupped this hot Latina pretty good.

- Yeah, Marisol. Tough as nails.

to get you into the rotation...

28:53.832 --> 28:56.767
- Hey, Hodgins.
- How's this for coincidence?

28:56.835 --> 29:00.271
Scarab beetles from Roberts's body
had the same short life span as Billie's...

29:00.338 --> 29:02.203
but not from cortisone.

29:02.273 --> 29:04.468
<i>His bugs died from

29:04.542 --> 29:07.033
Pine? In the desert?

29:07.112 --> 29:10.639
Yeah, pine oil resin is often used to
treat the same skin conditions...

29:10.715 --> 29:13.275
as the cortisone that killed
the other beetles.

29:13.351 --> 29:15.444

- Hey, Bones. Fight's on.
- No trouble convincing Joe?

Nothing a stack of bills couldn't fix.
She give us anything yet?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.227
- Nothing. We're gonna need a warrant.
- For what? What's our evidence?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.233
Agent Zhang's talking to it.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.600
<i>Marisol's bones, tissue
and muscle are still healing.</i>

30:06.671 --> 30:09.572
If we can match her injuries to Billie's,
we can prove they fought.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.269
If the fight's what killed Billie,
Marisol's guilty of manslaughter.

30:12.343 --> 30:15.210
Which would give us leverage to force her
to give up whoever runs these fights.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.544
Which she might do
in exchange for protection.

30:17.615 --> 30:20.516
So, you want to get her D.N.A. sample
and send it back to theJeffersonian.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.519
Actually, I want to send Marisol.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.452
This girl? The whole girl?

30:24.522 --> 30:26.615

Look, I didn't kill nobody, all right?
I didn't even fight.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.215
Well, if that's true, let's go over
to the scanner and prove it.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.087
- Or disprove it.
- Hodgins.

31:01.159 --> 31:04.720

33:06.351 --> 33:09.582
the mark looks like
it was delivered by a heel or a fist.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.589
<i>[Zack] Now a right,
followed by a grab to the throat...</i>

33:12.657 --> 33:15.592
<i>and Billie's down again.</i>

33:15.660 --> 33:17.719
[Grunting]

33:17.795 --> 33:19.592
<i>[Saroyan]
More damage to the scapula.</i>

33:21.032 --> 33:23.432
<i>Whoa. Easy on Billie's
chest there, Marisol.</i>

33:23.501 --> 33:26.800
Hairline fracture of Billie's sternum
at the third costal cartilage...

33:26.871 --> 33:29.601
is congruent with damage
to Marisol's left hand.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.437
And we have another match.

33:31.509 --> 33:36.708
<i>[Hodgins] Billie ducks and then causes
the maxillary fractures in Marisol's skull.</i>

33:36.781 --> 33:40.808
Marisol seems to favor the right-to-the-body,
left-to-the-head combo.

33:40.885 --> 33:44.321
- I do not.
- You can deny it all you want.
We've got the evidence here.

33:44.389 --> 33:47.290
<i>- [Zack] The choke hold...
- Excuse me. Tony!</i>

33:47.358 --> 33:50.486
<i>matches the bruising
on Billie's neck.</i>

33:50.561 --> 33:52.791
<i>Tony, stay down.</i>

33:52.864 --> 33:54.764
[Groaning]

33:54.832 --> 33:58.427
Monroe has calcium deposits
on his left medial epicondyle.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.562
And that helps me how?

34:00.638 --> 34:02.503
Excuse me.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.800
Excuse me.

34:05.877 --> 34:10.337
He can't extend his arm, and he lacks
range of motion in his quadratus lumborum.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.280
<i>Hit him there.</i>

34:12.350 --> 34:16.514
- Hit him where?
- In his lower back above his right kidney.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.679
The tide has turned, my friends.

34:19.757 --> 34:23.625
<i>- I told you she could fight.
- She doesn't fight. She dominates.</i>

34:27.398 --> 34:29.366
<i>Give him your Nolan move!</i>

34:34.205 --> 34:37.436
[Groans]

34:55.393 --> 34:57.520
Wow.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.495
You can say that again.

34:59.564 --> 35:02.727
- How could I miss that?
- We all missed it, Zack.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.893
Missed what? What is it?

35:04.969 --> 35:07.836
- Your winner! The last man standing!
- [Crowd Groaning, Booing]

35:07.905 --> 35:11.102
<i>Tony the Man-eating Tiger!</i>

35:11.175 --> 35:13.166
Tony the Tiger!

35:13.244 --> 35:15.405
- I did it.
- Your winner!

35:15.480 --> 35:17.812
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

35:17.882 --> 35:19.543
<i>[Man]
Are you kidding me?</i>

35:19.617 --> 35:21.915
- Hey, Cam.
- We missed it.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.921
The fatal blow was obscured
by all her other injuries.

35:24.989 --> 35:28.254
Marisol cracked Billie's ribs,
but not hard enough to puncture the lung.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.228
It was a bat. The same baseball bat
that killed the federal prosecutor.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.230
- What is it?
- [Beeps]

35:34.298 --> 35:38.860
It was a baseball bat that killed Billie,
just like the one used on Roberts.

35:47.512 --> 35:51.915
<i>So when you're dressed, um, the agent
will take you back to the airport.</i>

35:53.918 --> 35:55.909
Marisol...

35:58.756 --> 36:00.917
why do you fight?

36:00.992 --> 36:05.292
Where else am I gonna make a thousand
in one night without selling myself?

36:06.931 --> 36:10.765
And I can make even more betting on myself,
long as I ain't greedy.

36:10.835 --> 36:14.430
- What do you mean, greedy?
- Bookies don't mind us
making a few bucks on the side.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.939
- But just a few.
- Had you bet on your fight with Billie?

36:17.008 --> 36:20.205
- Girl cost me 200 dollars.
- Had Billie bet on herself?

36:22.380 --> 36:25.008
Marisol.

36:25.082 --> 36:29.314
From what I heard,
some guys picked Billie up after the fight.

36:29.387 --> 36:33.050
- They didn't look happy.
- Why didn't you tell the police? Or tell us?

36:33.124 --> 36:36.719
Look, I might not have much,
but what I got I aim to keep.

36:36.794 --> 36:40.890
What could be so important to you that you
could let somebody get away with murder?

36:40.965 --> 36:42.899
My daughter.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.731
She's two.
She lives with my mom, okay?

36:45.803 --> 36:49.569
- And if they found out I was brought here...
- Who's they?

36:51.042 --> 36:53.135
Look, I don't know.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.509
And I don't want to know.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.741
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:05.155
- [Brennan] Thanks, Angela.
- [Beeps]

37:05.223 --> 37:09.853
So we were right. Billie bet on herself,
which is why I bet on you.

37:09.927 --> 37:13.454
- You bet on me?
- Yeah, with Nick, the guy from Nolan's gym.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.965
It was one of two reasons.
But when I heard the odds, I couldn't...

37:16.033 --> 37:18.968
- My odds? What were they?
- You were a 20-to-1 underdog.

37:19.036 --> 37:21.630
- So I bet with Nick figuring that...
- 20-to-1 against?

37:21.706 --> 37:23.640
Really?
Did I look that bad?

37:23.708 --> 37:26.506
If Nick pays me, he's not our guy.

37:26.577 --> 37:30.843
If he doesn't, it may not prove he killed Billie,
but it'll put him in strong contention.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.782
At the very least.
Very smart, Bones.

37:33.851 --> 37:35.944
What was the other reason?

37:36.020 --> 37:38.181
Come on.
I have winnings to collect.

37:38.256 --> 37:42.454
<i>Hey, Nick!
Thought you ran out on us.</i>

37:42.526 --> 37:44.460
Nick Arno don't run
from anybody, sweetheart.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.019
Arno? Sweet Pete's kid?

37:47.098 --> 37:50.033
That was quite a show
you put on tonight, army boy.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.070
- Well, I had my lucky charm here.
- And you owe us some money.

37:53.137 --> 37:55.071
I suppose.

37:55.139 --> 37:59.906
But the gentleman I answer to, there's an
unwritten rule about fighters getting greedy.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.842
<i>Plus their spouses, too, I'm afraid.</i>

38:01.912 --> 38:05.279
- No, we're not married.
We're not even engaged.
- What's the rule?

38:05.349 --> 38:08.079
<i>Enjoy a taste,
but never expect a meal...</i>

38:08.152 --> 38:10.143
least of all with a ringer involved.

38:10.221 --> 38:12.621
<i>- Wait. I ain't no ringer.
- What's a ringer?</i>

38:12.690 --> 38:15.022
<i>- They think I cheated.
- She's good, army boy.</i>

38:15.092 --> 38:17.026
Real good.

38:17.094 --> 38:20.257
- But I seen Monroe take out whole biker gangs.
- Then I want my thousand back.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.561
- Consider it a fine.
- Fine? Are you serious?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.726
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear here.

38:24.802 --> 38:28.033
As our new top seed,
he works for us now.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.539
You don't just punch out
our best guy and walk away...

38:30.608 --> 38:33.042
not when there's
more money to be made.

38:33.110 --> 38:36.773
- You think you can make me fight for you?
- You only find out if you don't.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.509
I want to talk to this gentleman
that you answer to.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.517
And I want world peace.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.519
Look, take my advice.

38:43.587 --> 38:47.114
LetJoe here escort you
safely back to your hotel.

38:47.191 --> 38:50.786
Let your beautiful...
whatever she is...

38:50.861 --> 38:52.795
ice your wounds.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.730
In about a day or two,
we'll come and get you for your next fight.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.728
<i>- Get 'em outta here, Joe.
- Let's go.</i>

39:03.107 --> 39:06.042
I vouched for you. So it's my ass in the sling.
You understand?

39:06.110 --> 39:09.045
- We didn't mean to get you in trouble.
- Yet here I am.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.547
So you're gonna do
exactly what Nick says.

39:11.615 --> 39:14.550
Now, the people that are running things,
they don't play.

39:14.618 --> 39:17.052
I got enough strikes
against me as it is.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.282
- You got an itch, Joe?
- What?

39:19.357 --> 39:23.157
The cortisone. If it wasn't injected,
it could've been topical, like the pine oil.

39:23.227 --> 39:27.994
They're both common ingredients
in lotions used to treat skin ailments...

39:28.065 --> 39:31.228
- What the hell is she talking about?
- She's talking about your rash.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.236
Psoriasis?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.568
Eczema, which is none
of your concern. Let's go.

39:35.639 --> 39:38.233
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa.
Where we gonna go, Joe?

39:38.309 --> 39:40.300
We gonna go back to our hotel or...

39:40.378 --> 39:42.369
mile marker 15?

39:45.049 --> 39:49.816
<i>Where we found Billie Morgan
and Mason Roberts. You remember them.</i>

39:52.990 --> 39:54.924
Who are you people?

39:54.992 --> 39:56.983
I'm with the F.B.I., Joe.

39:57.061 --> 40:01.122
<i>Look, I don't have my badge, I don't have
my gun, but you'd be wise to believe me.</i>

40:01.198 --> 40:04.133
- Now, you have a choice.
- What kind of choice do I have?

40:04.201 --> 40:08.365
To be the man that you were
before you threw your first fight.

40:10.508 --> 40:14.945
Or you wind up dead
like the rest of these guys.

40:15.012 --> 40:18.175
You were the real deal.
You were strong and fast.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.275
Everybody wanted to
fight like you.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.684
There was so much money.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.817
Easy money.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.362
I thought I could handle it.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.558
<i>He was gonna get me
another shot at the title.</i>

40:35.633 --> 40:38.659
<i>- Who?
- Nick's father, Sweet Pete.</i>

40:38.736 --> 40:41.364
And he's owned me ever since.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.373
Made me throw more fights.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.433
- Made you kill Mason Roberts?
- I didn't kill anybody.

40:47.711 --> 40:50.179
I just buried 'em.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.374
For Pete?

40:53.951 --> 40:58.149
<i>And when Billie Morgan
won her bet, you buried her too.</i>

40:58.222 --> 41:02.659
She was a sweet kid,
just looking for a way out.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.853
I begged Pete to let her be.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.591
<i>- He killed her.
- Might as well have done it myself.</i>

41:07.665 --> 41:11.533
I brought her in here. I knew
what kind of punks she'd be dealing with.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.036
Bad enough
you're under Sweet Pete's thumb.

41:14.104 --> 41:17.562
But now you're under his son's too?

41:17.641 --> 41:20.371
That's what happens when
your luck turns in this town.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.538
You keep hoping
it's gonna turn around again...

41:23.614 --> 41:26.606
<i>hoping you're gonna
get back to even.</i>

41:28.018 --> 41:30.009
But you never do.

41:32.523 --> 41:35.117
Write your own story now, Joe.

41:35.192 --> 41:40.220
You can make Nick, Sweet Pete,
all his friends just disappear...

41:40.297 --> 41:44.859
the way they did to Billie and Roberts.

41:49.560 --> 41:52.095
Vegas authorities have
arrested Nick Arno,

41:52.128 --> 41:55.453
along with his father,
Tangier's casino gaming executive

41:55.488 --> 41:58.195
Peter Arno, otherwise
known as Sweet Pete,

41:58.241 --> 42:00.543
in connection with the
murder five years ago

42:00.591 --> 42:03.615
of federal prosecutor
Mason Roberts, among others.

42:03.650 --> 42:04.495
"Among others"?

42:04.528 --> 42:07.285
Is that what Billie Morgan
is to these people, "others"?

42:07.331 --> 42:08.453
It's day one, Bones.

42:08.490 --> 42:09.133
Relax.

42:09.170 --> 42:10.633
But you know what, I mean, Billie...

42:10.668 --> 42:12.093
Billie's going to have her story told.

42:12.139 --> 42:13.603
It's just a matter of time.

42:13.651 --> 42:15.084
So what was the second reason?

42:15.129 --> 42:15.955
What?

42:15.989 --> 42:19.444
You never told me the second
reason why you bet on me.

42:19.479 --> 42:22.835
Yeah, it was... silly.

42:23.789 --> 42:25.616
Aww, come on, you know, try me.

42:28.551 --> 42:30.623
Beginner's luck.

42:30.878 --> 42:34.994
I haven't lost at anything
since I've been here, so...

42:35.090 --> 42:36.484
well, I...

42:37.419 --> 42:39.873
I figured if I bet on you then...

42:39.908 --> 42:43.364
I couldn't lose. Sounds silly, right?

42:43.410 --> 42:45.144
Sounds familiar.

42:46.320 --> 42:50.343
Thanks. You're welcome.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.675
You ready? Yeah, let's go.
