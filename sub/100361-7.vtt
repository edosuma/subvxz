Frankie, I thought you were gonna
get up early to get a head start.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.016
On my world-famous banana potpie.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.809
It has real bananas in it,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.686
and real pot.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.480
In what world is that famous?

01:03.563 --> 01:06.775
A world of monkeys and stoners. And Sol.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.861
We can't go see him empty-handed.
Hand me the Mountain Dew.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.821
You know, with all due respect,

01:11.905 --> 01:16.076
I've seen Sol pre-surgery,
during his surgery, and post-surgery.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.621
And this is post-post-surgery,
and I am not-not going.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.499
So... you are going?

01:22.582 --> 01:25.752
No. Not until we figure out
this PR nightmare.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.881
We are not gonna achieve statehood
for Puerto Rico in one day.

01:30.715 --> 01:34.135
We have to roll up our sleeves
and solve this toilet problem,

01:34.219 --> 01:38.014
'cause my husband is coming back today,
and I actually would like to see him.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.058
Oh, but today is for Sol.

01:40.141 --> 01:43.061
I've got big surprises planned for him,

01:43.144 --> 01:46.481
including the <i>pièce de résistance.</i>

01:46.564 --> 01:50.652
<i>"Pièce de résistance"? </i>Oh, you've
been watching <i>Ratatouille </i>again.

01:50.735 --> 01:55.865
Jack is bringing Sol a tambourine
signed by the Mamas and one Papa.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.202
Why didn't somebody bring me a tambourine
when I had my knee replaced?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.703
I gave you one.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.666
But all you used it for was to let me know
when you were out of vodka.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.418
Oh, right. But still, it wasn't signed
by a celebrity.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.171
Because that was before I knew Jack.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.383
He knows everybody.
All the <i>crème de la crème.</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:16.219
Oh, you did watch <i>Ratatouille </i>again.
[chuckles]

02:16.302 --> 02:18.263
<i>Oui. </i>Jack's <i>le bombe.</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:21.099
Every Friday, he drives up to LA

02:21.182 --> 02:24.769
just to have lunch
with Neil Diamond and Henry Winkler.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.480
That's it. Frankie!

02:28.690 --> 02:31.234
-This could save our toilet.
-What could?

02:31.317 --> 02:34.154
We could... We could get a celebrity
to endorse it.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.366
-Imagine if we got Fonzie to sit on it.
-I'm not asking Jack.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.161
Our relationship is too new.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.747
Well, it wasn't too new
for you to ask him to bring a gift to Sol.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
Sol doesn't have a prostate.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.459
Well, I don't have one either!

02:48.543 --> 02:51.880
Grace, I really like this guy.

02:52.297 --> 02:57.093
And one of the things he likes about me is
that I don't care about his connections.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.887
Well, do you care about Rise Up?

02:58.970 --> 03:03.600
Are you kidding? Thanks to Rise Up,
the band is touring again.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.561
Therefore, this band member
is going with you.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.857
Sorry, but now it's a solo gig.
This way, you can't bother Jack.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.193
Oh, I won't, I promise.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.113
Unless, of course, Jack knows Elton John,

03:17.864 --> 03:20.909
but then we might have to rename it
the Elton John.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.119
[Grace chuckles]

03:25.580 --> 03:27.040
Your favorite nurse is here.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.334
I don't know.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.629
Elena at the hospital was truly special.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.049
Well, where is she now,
in your real time of need?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.468
At her daughter's quinceañera.

03:39.385 --> 03:43.514
By the way, we gave her a hundred bucks
and three "get well" balloons.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.684
Oh.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.520
I bet this ostrich is up to no good.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.605
-[squawks]
-[laughs]

03:51.773 --> 03:53.399
[whimpers]

03:53.483 --> 03:58.029
Oh. Funny videos aren't funny
when it hurts to laugh.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.822
Then why are you watching funny videos?

03:59.906 --> 04:00.949
[sniffs]

04:01.032 --> 04:02.450
Marge posted it,

04:02.867 --> 04:04.494
and Marge only posts gold.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.163
Why don't you watch an old movie
or something?

04:07.247 --> 04:10.333
I tried watching <i>Grumpy Old Men,</i>
but it reminded me of us.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.045
Except for the part where we were both
interested in Ann-Margret.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.757
Sol, what you need is
a nice quiet day at home for healing.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.426
And I promise you dull and boring.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.886
That's why I married you.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.971
[knocking]

04:24.264 --> 04:25.598
Surprise!

04:26.724 --> 04:27.934
Oh, dear God.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.689
You know, I've thought a lot about it,
and I know it means a lot to you.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.982
So...

04:34.565 --> 04:37.235
you should be the guardian
to Erin and Liz's kid.

04:37.735 --> 04:38.569
You mean it?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.947
Sign the papers.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.407
You're not messing around with me

04:42.490 --> 04:44.826
like the time you said you dug
my furry Chewbacca sweatshirt?

04:44.909 --> 04:48.204
I don't know who shaved it,
but I swear it wasn't me.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.373
Thank you so much.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.336
I'm gonna call Erin and Liz.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.297
Send them my love.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.343
Um, you know you just used
the word "love," right?

05:02.427 --> 05:03.594
I use it sometimes.

05:04.595 --> 05:08.933
Like when I'm doing something for Barry,
whom I'm fond of.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.020
Yeah, he's... okay.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.773
But you sounded
uncharacteristically magnanimous.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.319
That's because I was
characteristically devious.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.236
Ooh.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.823
Now that I've said yes to Barry being
their baby's guardian, I can milk it.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.993
He owes me for, like...

05:27.076 --> 05:28.369
[exhales]

05:28.453 --> 05:29.287
...ever.

05:29.370 --> 05:33.374
Yeah, but aren't you on the hook
for this kid if something happens?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.709
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.420
Here's the genius, nothing can happen.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.758
The odds of two women in their 30s
dying before their kid turns 18

05:41.841 --> 05:45.553
is 936,000 to one. I did the math.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.889
-You did not.
-I did not.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.433
I tricked Barry into doing the math.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.434
Yeah.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.604
<i>-Voilà!</i>
-Fucking French rat.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.439
Surprise number one.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.943
Actually, it's surprise number two.
Surprise number one is that you're here.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.197
-[laughs]
-Your banana potpie is my favorite.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.158
Almost as good
as her Chinese chicken cake.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.785
So, how's the recovery going?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.120
Slow and painful.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.164
To keep my mind off it,

06:13.247 --> 06:16.834
-I was watching one of Marge's videos.
-[gasps]

06:17.168 --> 06:20.254
Marge posted another video?
Let me see. Let me see!

06:21.589 --> 06:25.051
Keep your eye
on the postal worker's hamburger

06:25.134 --> 06:27.470
as she passes the ostrich.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.181
[laughs]

06:30.264 --> 06:33.643
Oh, God. Oh, Marge only posts gold.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.645
Oh, you've got to share this.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.688
What he's got to do is rest.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.565
All right. I'll share it.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.858
[laughs]

06:40.942 --> 06:42.902
-Frankie... is... dying.
-[keyboard clacking]

06:43.319 --> 06:46.030
But... I can't... watch.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.200
-I'm in too... much... pain.
-[post transmits]

06:49.617 --> 06:52.537
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh, I'll get it! I'll get it!

06:55.039 --> 06:56.332
[chuckles]

06:56.416 --> 06:57.500
[exhales]

06:57.583 --> 07:01.087
Without further ado, surprise number <i>deux!</i>

07:03.756 --> 07:05.883
[Frankie laughs]

07:12.807 --> 07:16.310
No, it's-- it's not personal, Bud.
It's just that your driving sucks.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.854
How is that not personal?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.150
You're obviously still mad
about the Jessica thing.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.943
[scoffs] What makes you think that?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.319
Because for 55 minutes in therapy,

07:25.403 --> 07:27.530
you kept saying you were still mad
about the Jessica thing.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.907
What do I have to do to fix this?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.785
Be over it. Like, why are you
still hung up on her?

07:33.161 --> 07:36.456
-'Cause you lost your virginity to her?
-I'm not hung up on her.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.875
Prove it. Once and for all.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.796
Fine. I will call the beach house and tell
Coyote and Jessica that we're coming over.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.048
Yeah. How do you know they're there?

07:47.842 --> 07:49.677
I follow her Instagram.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.473
You're gonna love the Rise Up,

07:53.556 --> 07:56.184
but not nearly as much
as surprise number three.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.853
It's even more fun than the toilet.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.646
-That's hard to imagine.
-Yeah, uh...

08:01.189 --> 08:03.608
Speaking of, when--
when is the surprise gonna get here?

08:03.691 --> 08:09.405
Any time now. But Grace, remember,
na-boo tah-tah ah-noo Jack-Jack dah-boh.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.740
Are you having another stroke?

08:11.324 --> 08:15.620
It's Furbish, the language spoken
by all Furbies and friends of Furby,

08:15.703 --> 08:17.163
which you clearly are not.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.499
Well, at least we're off the French.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.461
Simply translated,
"Don't ask Jack for anything."

08:23.544 --> 08:26.380
-Who's Jack?
-Well, he's an Aquarius,

08:26.464 --> 08:30.801
or a Type Four Enneagram,
if that paints a better picture for you.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.221
-It does not.
-No, it's Jack Ayres.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.847
Frankie's new boyfriend.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.224
You're gonna love him.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.644
Jack Ayres?

08:40.853 --> 08:44.815
Is that the Jack Ayres
who was in the music business?

08:44.899 --> 08:47.443
I guess he's a celebrity in his own right.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.030
Grace, maybe he'll sit on our toilet.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.867
You know, the music business
is full of characters.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.079
Lots of, you know, playas.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.830
Please don't ever say that again.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.375
You guys are so sweet to worry,

09:02.458 --> 09:04.794
but I promise, he's a great guy.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.504
That's why I want you to meet him.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.673
Frankie...

09:09.590 --> 09:13.135
uh, has this guy ever been married?

09:13.219 --> 09:16.472
Yes, to a terrible woman
who almost ruined his life.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.976
She and her bastard lawyers
took him for everything he had.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.897
I think we have our next surprise.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.315
We're the bastards.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.364
What? A gift for me?

09:33.447 --> 09:34.615
Just for being you.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.992
[exhales]

09:38.995 --> 09:42.373
"6:00 p.m. couples massage
at Helaine & Maris."

09:42.456 --> 09:44.208
-I like.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.794
"Dinner at Justin Ryan's." I like more.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.966
-You forgot to write on this one.
-Oh, no. Did I?

09:52.049 --> 09:54.427
Or is the rest of the night
just a mystery?

09:54.885 --> 09:56.846
I mean, not for me, because I planned it.
But...

09:56.929 --> 09:57.972
[clears throat] ...for you.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.141
[knocking]

10:01.017 --> 10:03.519
-Hello, people of Earth.
-[chuckles] Guilty.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.856
[laughs] We just came by to deliver
a small thank you

10:06.939 --> 10:08.524
for being the baby's guardian.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.650
[gasps]

10:10.067 --> 10:11.444
And...

10:11.527 --> 10:13.696
-for you.
-Wow.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.951
-Where does it open?
-No.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.536
-That's just... It is what it is.
-Yeah.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.246
-Very nice. Thank you.
-[Liz] Yeah.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.499
-Did you get this from our parking lot?
-A little further. [chuckles]

10:25.583 --> 10:29.629
It's actually a volcanic rock I picked up
at the summit of Mount Cotopaxi.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.549
Oh, is that from where you parachuted
and almost landed inside the volcano?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.467
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.302
-That was a close one.
-[exhales in relief]

10:36.385 --> 10:37.970
Oh, God, wow.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.973
Is that a joke or...?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.642
-No, it happened.
-[Erin and Liz] Yeah.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
I didn't know
that you had broken your leg, Liz.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.147
Is that... that's from the parachuting?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.733
[chuckles] No, no. Helicopter skiing.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.651
Oh.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.361
It's not broken. It's shattered.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.071
Oof.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.448
-Just... [explosive sound]
-Yeah. Ugh.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.284
You... Did you say helicopter skiing?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.411
-Yeah.
-Well, not, of course, while I'm pregnant.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.706
[chuckles] But as soon as this <i>bambino</i>
bungees out of me,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.918
I'm gonna get back in shape
and go to Pamplona.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.837
Oh, Pamplona!
Run with the bulls, right on.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.838
[Erin and Liz chuckle]

11:12.922 --> 11:14.048
[chuckles]

11:14.131 --> 11:17.426
How long after the baby is born?
Like 18 years after?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.095
That sounds good.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.388
The kid goes to college,

11:20.471 --> 11:22.556
Liz flies into a volcano,
everybody's happy.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.767
Hmm.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.936
You're so full of life.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.396
[mouthing]

11:28.729 --> 11:30.356
But for how much longer?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.317
That's what I wonder.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.863
[softly] Grace, do you remember
Pamela Sugarman?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.407
The woman Sol and I represented?

11:39.490 --> 11:42.201
Well, why don't you just ask me
if I remember the beach house?

11:42.284 --> 11:44.078
That divorce paid for it.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.997
Guess who Pamela Sugarman was married to?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.458
[whispers] I'll give you a hint.
He's gonna be here any minute.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.672
Jack is the guy you raked over the coals?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.590
At our client's insistence.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.634
-So now what? Do we tell Frankie?
-[Grace exhales]

11:58.718 --> 12:01.679
Of course we tell Frankie.
It's telling Jack I'm worried about!

12:01.762 --> 12:03.764
[whispers] We do not tell Frankie.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.268
She is extremely happy with this guy,

12:07.351 --> 12:09.437
and I need a face for my toilet.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.857
Remember when the judge
awarded Pamela everything?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.025
Jack broke out in hives,

12:15.359 --> 12:17.111
and the bailiff had to handcuff him

12:17.194 --> 12:19.321
to stop him
from scratching himself to death.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.492
-So, what do we do if Jack recognizes us?
-[scoffs] That was 20 years ago.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.120
And neither one of you has aged well.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.456
We were only in court together one time,

12:28.873 --> 12:31.167
and he only saw my left profile.

12:31.375 --> 12:36.464
Plus he was crying a lot,
so it was probably blurry.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.466
And I think I had a beard back then.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.509
You did. Me.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.053
[laughs]

12:43.137 --> 12:46.140
-Well... here we all are...
-[Allison chuckles nervously]

12:46.223 --> 12:47.475
...which is totally chill.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.768
[Jessica chuckles]

12:48.851 --> 12:51.020
Uh, Allison, of course
you know my brother, Coyote.

12:51.353 --> 12:55.399
And this is his girlfriend, Jessica.

12:55.858 --> 13:01.906
Jessica, this is
my beautiful, radiant, patient--

13:01.989 --> 13:03.574
I'm Allison. Hi.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.867
-[chuckles] Hi.
-Hi.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.619
-We have a daughter together.
-Yeah.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.162
Who we made from doing it.

13:08.245 --> 13:12.041
Is this why you came here?
To do whatever this is?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.794
-It's really great to meet you.
-Yeah.

13:14.877 --> 13:19.006
Anyway, I-I came here to tell you
and to show you

13:19.089 --> 13:22.718
that I'm in a very good place.
I'm happy. We're happy.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.220
Yeah, we're really happy.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.096
And I want you guys to be happy.

13:26.931 --> 13:31.060
So, Coyote, I'm sorry,
and I want to bury the hatchet.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.187
Me, too.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.897
Hug it out?

13:36.148 --> 13:36.982
[hugging grunts]

13:37.066 --> 13:38.484
[Bud chuckles]

13:38.567 --> 13:41.237
And Jessica, I-I'm so glad
that we could bury the hatchet, too.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.363
Oh. [slight chuckle]

13:42.738 --> 13:45.866
Uh, exactly what hatchet are we burying?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.743
Well, you know... how things ended.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.745
Ended?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.748
They barely started.
We dated for, like, six weeks.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.666
Oh.

13:53.749 --> 13:58.128
I mean, how abruptly and brutally
you broke up with me.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.173
Well, I wouldn't say it was brutal.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.259
H-How was it not?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.594
I mean, just the night before,
we had such an incredible time.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.430
Remember, on your pleather couch?

14:09.306 --> 14:13.060
We polished off a glass of Carlo Rossi,
we were both feeling a bit toasted?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.771
We had just watched the <i>Felicity </i>marathon?

14:16.647 --> 14:17.982
It was a big moment.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.233
Ah, it wasn't that big.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.819
[scoffs] No, they ran that marathon,
like, a thousand times.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.113
-Oh, I know, I keep missing it.
-Me, too.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.074
I lost my virginity to you that night!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.995
-You what?
-You probably didn't know this,

14:31.078 --> 14:33.455
-but I was still a virgin.
-[whispers] He was a virgin.

14:35.666 --> 14:41.297
And you probably don't know this,
after that night, you still were a virgin.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.133
Ah. [slight chuckle]

14:44.216 --> 14:47.761
And to think, I was worried
it would be weird coming here.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.017
Frankie, maybe you should call Jack.

14:53.475 --> 14:57.021
I'm not sure I have the strength
for another surprise.

14:57.104 --> 15:01.108
I've already had
the banana potpie and the toilet.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.986
And while those two pair delightfully...

15:04.069 --> 15:05.112
[doorbell rings]

15:05.195 --> 15:06.155
Oh, too late!

15:12.369 --> 15:14.330
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.290
-[chuckles]
-Come in. Come in!

15:17.082 --> 15:19.793
Hey, everybody, come here and meet Jack.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.880
Jack, this is--

15:22.963 --> 15:24.590
I'm Bobby. He's Solly.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.841
Oh, be cool, fools.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.594
You cats don't have to be hip
in front of Jack

15:28.677 --> 15:32.181
just because he was in the music biz.
Ya feel me?

15:32.514 --> 15:35.225
Uh, well, Solly,
then I think this is for you.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.604
Thank you so much. I love it.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.314
[Jack] Ah, it's an honor.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.608
Frankie raves about you.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.860
And that's rare to hear about an ex.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.156
I raved about my ex-wife too,
but I was in an institution.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.910
Uh, thanks to Frankie, I'm...
I'm open about that now.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.664
Sounds like you're in a very good place
and don't want to look back.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.042
I feel like I've met you two before.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.796
Were you in that gay Simon & Garfunkel
cover band in the '70s?

16:03.879 --> 16:04.755
-No.
-Yes.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.966
Actually, Bobby is an actor,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.718
and Solly dabbles in activism.

16:10.219 --> 16:14.390
Yeah, Bobby, why don't you get out of here
and whip up a snack for Jack?

16:14.682 --> 16:17.726
[Sol] Oh, let me show you
where the snacks are.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.980
I swear, if it wasn't for those month-long
benders with Iggy Pop,

16:21.063 --> 16:23.232
I'd be able to tell you how I know them.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.359
[slight chuckle] Thank heaven for Mr. Pop.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.360
[laughs]

16:27.403 --> 16:29.613
Frankie, you need to check on the plumber.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.156
-Why me?
-Why not you?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.574
Sold.

16:32.783 --> 16:36.537
But remember, na-boo ta-tah Jack-Jack.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.373
One of my biggest regrets in life
is that I never learned Furbish.

16:39.456 --> 16:42.292
So, I-I hear you know
a lot of celebrities.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.211
Would one of them
want to be a spokesperson

16:44.294 --> 16:46.672
for a sexy new product for the elderly?

16:46.755 --> 16:48.257
What kind of sexy product?

16:48.882 --> 16:52.720
Well, that's between me
and the celebrity you get us.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.806
Oh. Hmm.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.267
-[exhales]
-Filters are bullshit.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.477
They're better for the baby.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.105
She's lighting up again, Barry.
She's lighting up again!

17:03.188 --> 17:04.773
She's nervous about the baby.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.942
[exhales]

17:07.568 --> 17:11.196
You never told me
they were death-defying lesbians.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.617
Swimming to Alcatraz during El Niño
does not make them death-defying.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.912
You allowed me to allow you
to sign those papers,

17:18.996 --> 17:23.542
knowing that Chain Smoker and Death Wish
out there are having your baby.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.712
Liz and Erin are going to be great moms
because they drink life up.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.423
Oh, my God. Am I the only one here
who isn't fucking insane?

17:29.506 --> 17:32.509
How are they going to be great moms
if they are not alive to raise this kid?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.969
You need to do something.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.971
What am I gonna do,
tell them not to live their lives?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.806
No, tell them not to end them.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.974
[coughs]

17:39.391 --> 17:40.726
-[Erin clears throat]
-[exhales]

17:41.602 --> 17:43.812
Okay, here's the deal.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.358
Both of you need to start acting
like you're having a child. Okay?

17:48.942 --> 17:49.860
You...

17:50.486 --> 17:52.321
stop jumping into volcanoes.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.410
And you, quit the smokes, Marlboro Mom.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.370
And what exactly do you know
about being a mother?

18:00.454 --> 18:01.872
That I'm not going to be one.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.709
But if I were, here's the things
that I'd give up in my own life:

18:05.793 --> 18:06.794
my morning vape,

18:06.877 --> 18:09.463
following people
who cut me off in traffic,

18:09.546 --> 18:10.881
my afternoon vape,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.300
shower beers...

18:13.383 --> 18:14.885
What else, what else,
what else, what else?

18:14.968 --> 18:19.515
Oh, I know, jumping into volcanoes.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.810
-[exhales]
-[clears throat]

18:22.893 --> 18:26.647
Brianna, we really appreciate
your concern...

18:27.189 --> 18:28.398
But fuck off.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.192
-It's our lives.
-[Erin] Yeah.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.276
Excuse me.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.488
Wow. She just ran over my foot.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.489
Ow.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.202
[exhales] You know what, I don't think
they appreciate your concern.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.290
I haven't spoken to Stevie Nicks
in 20 years,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.084
but sure, I'd be glad to call her

18:47.167 --> 18:49.503
and ask her to sit on a toilet
in a commercial.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.421
Oh, that would be great, thanks.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.632
And again, keep this between us.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.843
Oh, I'm not even gonna tell Stevie Nicks.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.345
Grace, you promised me!

18:58.720 --> 19:01.890
-Frankie, how's it going with the toilet?
-Oh, your sweet toilet nothings

19:01.974 --> 19:03.225
won't work on me.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.812
I may not have been able to hear you,
but this robot in my ear did.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
I heard everything you just said.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.318
And I think I've just picked up
an FM radio station.

19:13.402 --> 19:17.406
Leave some extra time for yourself
if you're heading to San Miguel. Ugh!

19:17.489 --> 19:18.866
[grunts] Oh, God.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.286
[Jack chuckles]

19:26.248 --> 19:29.376
-Were you at Reggae on the River in '94?
-Ya, mon.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.589
Now you get a hearing aid?

19:33.672 --> 19:37.134
For years, I had to throw cheese at you
to get your attention.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.552
I got it so I can hear Jack,

19:38.635 --> 19:41.972
not to hear you do the one thing
I asked you not to do.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.641
You do seven things a day
I ask you not to do.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.603
Actually, I do more. You catch seven.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.771
But I caught you this time.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.192
Frankie, if we don't do
something big soon,

19:53.483 --> 19:55.819
Rise Up is not gonna happen.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
This is our company's second act.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.657
I mean, it's-it's-it's our second act.

20:01.158 --> 20:05.787
Isn't it worth asking Jack
for just a little celebrity endorsement?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.290
Not at the expense of my relationship.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.542
Oh... What about my relationship?

20:10.626 --> 20:11.877
Nick landed an hour ago,

20:11.960 --> 20:14.213
and I'm still here,
trying to make something happen.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.715
So go home and ask him to invest.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.759
You know I don't want to do that.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.929
Right, because you think
it will sabotage your relationship,

20:22.012 --> 20:25.349
but apparently, it's okay
to sabotage mine.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.266
[Grace exhales]

20:26.350 --> 20:28.602
I liked you better when you couldn't hear.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.193
Bud, we didn't have sex that night.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.154
Excuse me, it still counts
if you don't climax. Right, Allison?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.405
You're not helping yourself.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.201
We didn't have sex
because you didn't actually, you know...

20:45.786 --> 20:46.870
stick the landing.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.538
-Oh, honey.
-Oh, Bud.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
W-What are you talking about?

20:51.124 --> 20:52.793
I-I-I remember having sex.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.296
Oh, you had sex. Just not with me.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.341
But I remember it very clearly.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.051
We drank.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.304
We were exhausted from all those hours
of Felicity's emotions.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.640
I wore two condoms
because I was worried about germs.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.017
-There's the man I married.
-So far this all tracks.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.561
And we were on your soft, cushy sofa.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.105
Bud, you fucked the couch.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.732
-Oh, God.
-Story still tracks.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.908
I fucked the couch.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.036
[Frankie exhales]

21:30.831 --> 21:33.875
Why don't we get to know
each other a little better?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.011
Can you get her a record deal off that?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.804
-[Jack chuckles]
-[Frankie inhales]

21:45.887 --> 21:48.807
Jack, you know, you and Robert
share a love of music.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.602
In fact, he's an accomplished singer
in his own right.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.230
He even has a Tappy.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.732
Wow, what's a Tappy?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.109
-Do you know what a Tony is?
-Yes.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.486
Okay, well, then you know what a Tappy is.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.739
Except the awards show is in a Dress Barn.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.074
"Robert Hanson."

22:07.743 --> 22:08.660
Hanson?

22:08.744 --> 22:09.828
Hanson.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.748
-Hanson.
-Ow, my cancer!

22:12.831 --> 22:15.000
Oh, no, Solly!

22:15.083 --> 22:17.586
-Oh, everyone, quick, go home!
-[Sol] Ow! Ow!

22:17.669 --> 22:19.713
-[Sol] Oh!
-Hanson and Bergstein?

22:23.508 --> 22:26.553
You bloodsucking motherfuckers!

22:26.636 --> 22:30.474
Robert, you are very bad
at planning these quiet days at home.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.695
Well, I spoke to Erin.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.157
They've, uh, calmed down a bit.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.869
They're even letting us keep the rock,
so that's good.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.539
Great. And remember, we'll have to take
turns driving the kid to mommy and me.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.583
And, of course, we'll have to pay
for Junior's therapy

22:56.666 --> 22:58.001
after losing both mommies

22:58.085 --> 23:00.420
to a great white shark
and a carton of Reds.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.839
Let's not forget how much
you're gonna fuck the kid up.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.843
-That's not funny, Barry.
-Agreed.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.970
And the part I find particularly unfunny

23:09.054 --> 23:11.098
is that the only reason you agreed
to become a guardian

23:11.181 --> 23:13.141
is because you thought
it was never gonna happen.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.561
Yeah. That's why everyone agrees
to be a guardian.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.021
Not me.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.233
Wait, wait, is this the reason
you had me do that math?

23:21.858 --> 23:25.529
You never told me
that these women have a death wish.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.698
Interesting, because you never told me
the supposedly nice thing you did for me

23:28.782 --> 23:30.283
was solely for your own benefit.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.368
Shit.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.621
That reminds me,
we're gonna be late for our massages.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.248
You know what, I'm sorry.

23:36.873 --> 23:37.707
No, don't be.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.752
-I mean, I forgot about it, too.
-I'm sorry I ever asked you to do this.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.297
Okay.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.174
Now I feel bad.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.929
You know, I get it,
you don't like to commit to things.

23:51.012 --> 23:54.057
You made that perfectly clear
the first three times I proposed to you.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.017
And I'm okay with that.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.771
But it was stupid of me
to ask you to commit to this.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.314
Well, don't beat yourself up.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.611
But I am committed to this.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.988
I know you are.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.282
So can we not stress about it and...?

24:10.824 --> 24:14.536
We have a policy about not talking about
the future in this relationship, right?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.079
So let's not start now.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.791
Yes, exactly. I mean, who knows where
this kid is even gonna be in the future?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.295
Right. Who knows
where we'll be in the future?

24:23.378 --> 24:25.755
Or if we'll even be in the future.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.968
That's how we do things, right?

24:36.224 --> 24:37.225
Right.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.354
[heavy breaths]

24:45.108 --> 24:46.109
What's happening?

24:46.818 --> 24:49.905
Those two... those two ruined my life!

24:50.489 --> 24:53.533
What did these two life-ruiners do to you?

24:53.617 --> 24:56.453
Sol, I know you're hurt and can't run,
but do you mind if I do?

24:56.536 --> 24:57.662
I'll race you.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.667
Uh, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

25:02.751 --> 25:04.628
-They... they... they...
-[Grace clears throat]

25:04.711 --> 25:08.215
Remember... Remember the Sugarman divorce
from a million years ago?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.257
No.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.302
-You know, Pamela Sugarman.
-[scoffs]

25:12.385 --> 25:14.846
-The big case that went on forever.
-[yells] And ever!

25:16.056 --> 25:18.016
We bought the beach house with that money.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.184
[yells] My money!

25:19.935 --> 25:21.228
Oh, my God.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.064
You're Mr. Pamela Sugarman?

25:24.147 --> 25:27.317
That's right. And your ex-husband
ripped out my guts,

25:27.400 --> 25:30.987
flame-broiled them, ate them,
and then stuck me with the bill.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.114
Her ex-husband did it, too.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.992
Sol Bergstein is the guy
you've been raving about?

25:36.326 --> 25:39.079
The great guy you'd still be married to
if he wasn't gay?

25:39.621 --> 25:42.249
-I want my tambourine back.
-Get the man his tambourine.

25:42.332 --> 25:46.836
Look, I'm as shocked as you are,
but Sol was just doing his job.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.381
Was it his job to destroy my life?

25:49.464 --> 25:51.174
I don't know the particulars.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.093
I can't be around that guy!

25:53.176 --> 25:55.136
Oh, don't you think
that's a little childish?

25:55.220 --> 25:56.221
Is not!

25:56.763 --> 25:59.057
Those two guys are toxic for me.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.393
But Sol is part of my family.

26:01.476 --> 26:05.689
Look, if you need Sol in your life,
we're not gonna work.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.649
-[Frankie gasps]
-Oh.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.693
Jack, are you an idiot?

26:09.776 --> 26:13.863
Yes! Your ex-husband had me
legally declared an idiot.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.283
[whispers] Oh, yeah.
We needed to redo the patio.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.538
I get it, Jack.
Sol did a terrible thing to you.

26:21.621 --> 26:24.165
He did a terrible thing to me too.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.459
But I was able to move past it.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.753
So you can go out that door,

26:29.504 --> 26:33.466
but if you don't let go of your anger,
it doesn't matter how far you walk,

26:33.883 --> 26:35.468
it'll follow you.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.305
But I won't.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.601
I'm so sorry.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.650
[Jack grunts]

26:53.945 --> 26:55.739
I love that toilet!

26:56.156 --> 26:57.574
It's a brilliant idea.

26:57.657 --> 27:00.994
I mean, someday,
everyone's going to need that, right?

27:01.870 --> 27:04.331
There's your stupid endorsement.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.086
I had sex with a couch.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.965
Hey, at least you and Coyote made up.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.593
And now you don't have resentment
towards Jessica anymore.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.429
Of course, I can never look her
in the face again,

27:19.846 --> 27:21.514
because I had sex with a couch.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.475
Forget it. It's ancient history.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.518
Revisionist history.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.355
If I didn't do it with Jessica,

27:28.813 --> 27:31.191
that means I was still a virgin
for another four months,

27:31.274 --> 27:35.445
until one night of meaningless sex
with Laurie Hoonhout.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.239
Your first time
was still better than mine.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.993
I... uh...

27:42.077 --> 27:44.412
lost my virginity to a clown.

27:46.414 --> 27:50.001
What do you mean, "a clown"? Like--
Like the class clown or a "clown" clown?

27:50.335 --> 27:53.004
I'm talking red nose, squirting flower,

27:53.296 --> 27:56.758
came out of a tiny car with 67
other Bozos, Chuckles, and Krustys.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.760
And what--
And what was your clown's name?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.053
Uncle Bubbles.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.513
[stifled laughs]

28:02.806 --> 28:03.723
You win.

28:04.516 --> 28:09.646
Okay, maybe you got off to a bumpy start,
but you sure know what goes where now.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.523
[Allison laughs]

28:11.606 --> 28:15.151
I am the luckiest man on the planet
to have you as my wife.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.696
Mmm. Should we pull over?

28:17.987 --> 28:19.155
Absolutely.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.033
That back seat's looking pretty good.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.036
But I look better, right?

28:25.328 --> 28:26.496
[both chuckle]

28:36.631 --> 28:38.383
I was proud of you.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.011
You did the right thing with Jack.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.850
You can go home now, Grace.
I know Nick's back.

28:46.933 --> 28:49.936
[scoffs] Yeah. But I'm here with you.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.439
I'm not in the mood to work on Rise Up.

28:52.522 --> 28:56.025
I don't care about Rise Up right now.
I care about you.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.487
And I'm not going anywhere
until you feel okay.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.157
I don't feel okay.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.534
I really liked him.

29:05.952 --> 29:06.995
[Frankie exhales]

29:08.204 --> 29:10.540
And I hate that you have to go home.

29:10.623 --> 29:11.708
I really like you, too.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.086
And I hate that I have to go, too.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.215
[Frankie chuckles]

29:24.679 --> 29:27.015
[Jack] You really should lock
your front door.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.601
There's no way of knowing
who might wander in here.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.186
I'm glad it was you.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.315
I... [exhales]

29:35.398 --> 29:36.483
I'm sorry.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.319
I was a jerk, and then I overreacted.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.323
And you're right,
I-I-I need to get over it.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.326
I don't want to lose you.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.369
I don't want you to lose me, either.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.121
I lose myself enough.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.374
So, we okay?

29:54.709 --> 29:57.420
Can I have the tambourine back for Sol?

29:57.670 --> 29:59.547
[exhales] Sure can.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.842
Then we're okay.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.010
[Jack chuckles]

30:04.761 --> 30:08.056
I have to admit,
this is a really nice patio.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.893
Even if it was built
from the salt of my tears.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.646
-It is pretty rad.
-Yeah.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.482
And maybe things turned out
better than you think.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.025
How so?

30:19.359 --> 30:21.277
If I didn't have this house,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.614
I'd have nothing to invite you in to.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.117
