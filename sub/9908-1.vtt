YELLOWBRICKROAD (2010)

00:16.190 --> 00:19.040
<i> One morning in 1940,
ran the entire population of Friar ...</i>

00:19.041 --> 00:21.483
<i> north,
over a mountain trail in the wilderness. </i>

00:21.484 --> 00:24.432
<i> Most of them were frozen to death.
Some were brutally massacred. </i>

00:24.433 --> 00:26.931
<i>But most were
never recovered. </i>

00:26.932 --> 00:30.962
<i>In this confidential information
is a sound recording of a survivor ...</i>

00:30.963 --> 00:34.891
<i> performed prior
of this study. </i>

00:38.655 --> 00:40.550
<i>In office 8
reported at 11.00 </i>

00:40.551 --> 00:44.492
<i> on October 10, 1940. </i>

00:44.493 --> 00:48.710
<i> File: 63708NA90 </i>

00:48.889 --> 00:52.087
<i>Subject  is the last citizen,
and sole survivor of the missing. </i>

00:52.088 --> 00:54.604
<i> provided at 257. </i>

00:55.275 --> 01:00.560
<i> This case needs further study.
Gentlemen. Thank you. </i>

01:01.049 --> 01:04.626
<i> Sir, how is it that you are the only
surviving are </i>

01:06.343 --> 01:10.005
<i>I walked  ...
- You're the only survivor. Why?</i>

01:11.374 --> 01:15.715
<i> "Everybody else dead ...
"I could not ...'</i>

01:18.515 --> 01:22.542
<i> "I left them behind ...
the path ...'</i>

01:22.547 --> 01:26.644
<i>Subject  holds his hands over his ears
and pain. Mr. ...</i>

01:27.686 --> 01:31.626
<i> What you heard?
- I heard ...</i>

01:31.943 --> 01:33.930
<i> What you heard, sir?
Mr. </i>

01:34.150 --> 01:37.799
Do not you hear?
Do not you hear?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.585 --> 02:05.544
Am I the only one here?

02:06.494 --> 02:09.058
<i> No sir, I'm here. </i>

02:11.456 --> 02:13.914
I'm not too late, right?
- About two minutes we close.

02:14.307 --> 02:15.436
Thank God.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.117
<i>You are here for Friar  New
Hampshire, the old way. </i>

02:18.886 --> 02:19.817
Yes.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.013
<i>Two forms of
Photo identification, if you want. </i>

02:30.307 --> 02:34.564
<i> Mr. Barnes, you're asking,
There are certainly people ...</i>

02:34.565 --> 02:36.100
<i> who would rather not have. </i>

02:36.101 --> 02:37.131
I understand that.

02:37.345 --> 02:40.079
I have full confidence in
you that my collection of letters ...

02:40.080 --> 02:42.916
will add to the gray
in the public domain.

02:42.949 --> 02:45.752
<i> You should be thinking more positive,
Mr. Barnes. </i>

02:46.867 --> 02:52.029
<i> All for you The file,
photographs, and songs. </i>

02:53.887 --> 02:55.272
Oh, my God.
- In addition ...

02:55.601 --> 03:00.036
<i> I want to apologize for all these years
of discomfort with your wife and you </i>

03:01.452 --> 03:03.163
<i> Even if you do not really need. </i>

03:04.814 --> 03:06.592
But I do.

03:08.323 --> 03:10.914
<i> I will give you some photos, Mr. Barnes. </i>

03:16.088 --> 03:16.995
Excuse me ...

03:18.822 --> 03:20.379
Hello?

03:41.337 --> 03:42.492
We drink.

03:43.229 --> 03:44.672
You drink.

03:45.549 --> 03:47.704
You will now no classes, Teddy.
So drink.

03:47.856 --> 03:49.650
Pour into well but, Walter.

03:50.272 --> 03:54.775
Besides, the general view is
if you can not do what you like ...

03:55.017 --> 03:57.019
you than resorting
to education.

03:58.476 --> 04:02.519
Except that I did not know where I was going,
that's what happened.

04:03.066 --> 04:04.538
And that's why we drink.

04:14.386 --> 04:16.762
I will really miss.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.129
I do not know what to do.

04:32.437 --> 04:35.053
What if we look at drinking
we throw everything out the window?

04:36.154 --> 04:37.368
And work for what it is.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.094
The Walters is staying here.

04:41.131 --> 04:43.344
What if we do another book?

04:44.043 --> 04:46.022
He has it.
- No, he does not.

04:55.016 --> 04:56.711
In some ways it is real.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.295
<i> Mr. and Ms. Barnes, this is Jerry Abbott
from Hampshire. </i>

05:04.499 --> 05:06.863
<i>We just want to pass
that your request has been through. </i>

05:07.056 --> 05:08.970
<i> I can not say that people here
there are very enthusiastic about. </i>

05:08.971 --> 05:12.493
<i>The Ranger will  arrangements.
He will no firearms with them. </i>

05:13.070 --> 05:14.165
<i> And you better not. </i>

05:14.717 --> 05:16.240
<i> Good luck with the trip. </i>

05:16.965 --> 05:19.076
<i> Who the hell do you think you are? </i>

05:19.753 --> 05:21.099
<i> Stay away </i>

05:22.060 --> 05:25.066
<i> Do not come here.
We do not talk to you. </i>

05:25.237 --> 05:28.910
<i> We come here to help people
like you to avoid, transfer it. </i>

05:35.111 --> 05:36.593
Here you will be afraid of?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.265
In a good way.

05:40.928 --> 05:44.367
Would you be disappointed
if you go there and ...

05:45.388 --> 05:49.630
with a clear story
and pictures of a few bones?

05:50.959 --> 05:55.518
Yes.
I was very disappointed.

05:56.201 --> 05:57.933
Just like me.

06:03.648 --> 06:05.298
I love you, Bellamy.

06:06.285 --> 06:07.966
I've already told you?

06:10.132 --> 06:11.789
I love you more.

06:28.826 --> 06:31.698
Well, day one: not very difficult.

06:32.531 --> 06:36.180
Today we pack up and leave.
We want at noon in the path.

06:36.622 --> 06:38.904
As many field studies
before dark.

06:38.938 --> 06:43.485
Why do not yet summer camp
and we do the consultation here.

06:44.635 --> 06:48.491
I'll go first. I'm Melissa Barnes
and do this regularly ...

06:48.492 --> 06:50.465
and put the compass in the field.

06:50.466 --> 06:54.909
I'm Cy Banbridge, forest service,
They have asked me ...

06:54.910 --> 06:57.328
but it seems unnecessary.

06:57.329 --> 07:01.851
Daryl Luger, I am reader.
- Luger Erin, we are readers.

07:02.565 --> 07:06.153
There are no new maps of the north
added since the turn of the century so ...

07:06.928 --> 07:09.163
So apparently we are lucky.

07:09.203 --> 07:10.546
Is that so, Cy.
- That's us.

07:10.547 --> 07:13.243
Michelle Bateman,
Teddy and Melissa's intern.

07:13.373 --> 07:17.550
Jill has the kit with them
so they can take care of the blisters.

07:17.734 --> 07:19.912
Trent and painkillers.

07:22.206 --> 07:24.538
Walter Myrick, I give behavioral psychology.

07:24.785 --> 07:28.453
I'll do some testing day
and captured with this camera.

07:28.868 --> 07:33.880
But you know, no stress,
Just as normal as possible.

07:35.432 --> 07:38.721
It's still early I know, but ...
I make enough.

07:40.068 --> 07:44.058
Teddy Barnes, co-author.
Photographer, that's clear.

07:44.639 --> 07:47.654
The story of the Friar fascinates me.

07:49.931 --> 07:53.058
I'm not sure we all
will find answers.

07:53.532 --> 07:57.404
But I can tell you that we
blessed that we get a chance ...

07:57.487 --> 08:01.164
a legend,
able to establish a history.

08:05.797 --> 08:07.506
Pancakes.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.827
Hey.

08:14.058 --> 08:18.604
<i> I'm going to a few questions
and want you to honestly answer, right? </i>

08:18.830 --> 08:24.107
<i> not think too much, is that right?
- Great, but ask your questions.</i>

08:24.384 --> 08:26.551
<i> What is your name?
- I have already ..</i>

08:26.552 --> 08:30.519
<i> I see, Cy Banbridge. </i>

08:30.520 --> 08:32.453
<i> What are you here? </i>

08:33.269 --> 08:35.511
<i> Arkinlot.
- Good enough.</i>

08:36.857 --> 08:42.116
<i>What  smell you associate with the color red?
- You're definitely a joke?</i>

08:42.722 --> 08:46.649
<i> Cherry, I cherry. </i>

08:49.255 --> 08:52.293
<i> What does that mean?
- That you have no brain damage.</i>

09:07.972 --> 09:10.098
Here.
- You keep him with you.

09:38.222 --> 09:41.781
Here, this way.
- Here?

09:46.105 --> 09:50.558
According to this, and the coordinates that you
should have given it here.

09:50.559 --> 09:52.681
That thing is broken.

09:52.682 --> 09:55.895
These coordinates are correct.
- Do you see a path somewhere then?

10:15.507 --> 10:17.494
We are looking for a mountain path.

10:17.699 --> 10:21.221
Are you a bunch of backward walking,
or something? For you are in a cinema.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.600
Hey, wait a minute.
- Fuck you.

10:23.639 --> 10:27.083
Tickets are eight dollars,
So 56 of you together.

10:27.175 --> 10:29.606
So you go watch a movie?

10:29.979 --> 10:32.058
Hey, you're awesome.

10:32.734 --> 10:34.982
Forward, this is not happening.

10:36.559 --> 10:38.396
We're outta here.

11:31.479 --> 11:32.900
What are we looking?

11:33.812 --> 11:37.125
Something with guns, tits,
and the end of the world.

11:41.045 --> 11:42.828
Nobody wants to talk to us.

11:44.476 --> 11:48.274
It's good. I am not one of the evil,
just jealous.

11:49.815 --> 11:53.560
Why?
- Because you can walk down the road.

11:54.190 --> 11:58.787
Only we can not,
for there is no path, right?

12:00.529 --> 12:03.281
The coordinates were false,
in one way or another ...

12:04.242 --> 12:07.312
they lead us here, why we are here
Now go run like motherfuckers.

12:12.639 --> 12:15.108
Has anyone ordered to
not to talk to us?

12:19.726 --> 12:21.280
My grandfather has
worried me this job.

12:21.982 --> 12:26.396
He has been the owner for a while, until
He died of throat cancer last year.

12:26.970 --> 12:30.539
He was friends with the owner.

12:30.877 --> 12:35.572
That was before everyone walked away.
- Your grandfather was here in 39, 40?

12:35.741 --> 12:38.824
To houthaktripjes weekend, yes.

12:40.683 --> 12:42.457
I have to change the coil.
- Wait a minute.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.704
I am a movie star and become
now paid.

12:47.841 --> 12:50.637
Reach right down
on the back.

12:50.941 --> 12:55.983
Left over from the past:
"Gone With The Wind" original print.

12:58.558 --> 13:01.096
That's half the Oz movie.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.278
Who was stuck in the projector.

13:04.478 --> 13:08.459
He plays it no longer, it is worn
touched by all the times playing.

13:09.545 --> 13:12.602
Hey, I did not say
you could use me as a source, right?

13:14.352 --> 13:18.228
I do not have much money.
- You have something much better, an expedition.

13:18.229 --> 13:19.195
Listen!
- You take me in the leg.

13:19.211 --> 13:21.292
I walk my own stuff,
I can cook.

13:21.293 --> 13:24.486
I can tell you everything
I know the book.

13:24.487 --> 13:27.409
I have no real family anymore,
no money to go to the South.

13:28.106 --> 13:32.029
Please, you must take me.
- I appreciate it, but you're not listening.

13:33.281 --> 13:37.458
There is no path.
There is no journey.

13:37.459 --> 13:39.254
But there is a path.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.594
Have you seen it?
- There is even a marker.

13:44.395 --> 13:47.848
Stone.
It says 'yellow brick road' on.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.462
We drink it now and then,
when we are afraid.

13:53.129 --> 13:55.409
I have the first 100 meters once walked.

14:11.888 --> 14:15.637
YELLOW BRICK ROAD

15:11.845 --> 15:15.051
<i> What is your full name
- Ann Liliane Luger.</i>

15:15.382 --> 15:19.119
<i> I want you to talk Jibbrisch
until I say you should stop. </i>

15:26.376 --> 15:28.187
<i> Ann, stop it.
- Okay.</i>

15:29.276 --> 15:31.417
<i> Without looking at your watch
Can you tell me what time it is? </i>

15:32.208 --> 15:35.210
<i> 15.17 hours.
- Well done.</i>

15:35.238 --> 15:38.156
<i> Two times two is four.
Four times four is eight. </i>

15:38.157 --> 15:40.579
<i> Two times eight is sixteen. </i>

15:40.580 --> 15:43.561
<i> Sixteen times two is thirty-two. </i>

15:43.562 --> 15:46.823
<i> Thirty-two times two is sixty-four. </i>

15:46.824 --> 15:50.206
<i>Sixty-four times two is
one hundred twenty-eight. </i>

16:15.854 --> 16:18.517
Another hour.

16:18.597 --> 16:21.313
You could break your wrist again,
that would be nice.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.115
Only one hour, right?

16:39.288 --> 16:42.747
Indian cucumber,
Count on them but, they are tasty.

16:42.748 --> 16:43.984
Cool.

16:50.534 --> 16:53.091
How do you feel now?

16:54.702 --> 16:58.337
<i> a bit excited, full of insects,
but otherwise great. </i>

16:58.392 --> 17:01.584
<i>Make  ongoing movement,
until I say stop. </i>

17:05.992 --> 17:08.945
<i> I'm not finished.
- I said stop. Thank you. </i>

17:11.560 --> 17:14.655
<i> Count prime numbers,
start at two. </i>

17:16.509 --> 17:18.224
Two, three.

17:18.258 --> 17:19.939
Five, seven.

17:20.357 --> 17:22.742
Eleven, thirteen. Seventeen ...

17:22.743 --> 17:26.027
nineteen, twenty-three.
- Fantastic. Stop.

17:30.710 --> 17:35.069
I won the Olympics for fastest lighter
four years in a row.

17:36.392 --> 17:40.235
Summer Camp Olympics, of course.
- Fastest lighter?

17:41.244 --> 17:42.636
How do you do that?

17:42.636 --> 17:45.611
You tie a rope 18 cm
above the ground ...

17:45.612 --> 17:49.956
and the first who, by
through fire, wins.

17:49.957 --> 17:55.671
18 inches? Child's play.
I do it twice as fast, at least.

18:07.799 --> 18:11.197
Hey, Cy!
Moose are dangerous?

18:11.830 --> 18:15.317
Yes, with moose mess, for sure.

18:15.505 --> 18:19.025
I have seen how someone on the horns
took him and threw 15 meters far.

18:19.043 --> 18:22.278
If that's all you are worried about.
I do not hate bears.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.824
A bear kills a lot more than a moose.

18:24.825 --> 18:27.620
Yes, but it's the horns,
I'm not on the horns.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.540
Hey, guys.

18:33.232 --> 18:35.765
Give to me.
- Give me that.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.948
One, two ...

18:39.423 --> 18:42.411
Cy?
- You want to trade? Lollipop, lollipop.

18:43.013 --> 18:44.897
Stop!

18:45.176 --> 18:46.509
No one moves.

18:56.517 --> 18:59.560
Grab your soul!
- Asshole!

19:00.850 --> 19:04.098
How do you get that?
- Just found.

19:04.636 --> 19:07.935
In the woods when I had to pee.
I almost slipped on the leaves.

19:10.874 --> 19:13.917
Have you peed on?
- Very out mid thirties.

19:13.918 --> 19:15.245
Someone takes the piss us.
- Look at the label.

19:15.246 --> 19:19.859
You chased me the meaning of fear.
- Wait, look.

19:20.004 --> 19:23.339
Impossible for this hat
70 years is located here.

19:23.340 --> 19:25.065
Maybe someone lost it.

19:25.819 --> 19:27.668
At this time.

19:28.324 --> 19:32.623
Someone close.
- So my spine.

19:32.624 --> 19:35.488
Nice try, but that's wrong.

19:37.253 --> 19:39.562
We should keep him well.
- Can I put it on?

19:40.056 --> 19:41.780
Why would you want to put it on?

19:42.536 --> 19:45.145
I do not know, it seems best
good way to keep the hat.

19:45.873 --> 19:47.205
Of course.

19:51.786 --> 19:53.796
Wait a minute.
Do not do it with the hat.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.761
Your name?
- Melissa Barnes.

19:59.762 --> 20:03.256
Where are you now?
- On the path. We are on the path.

20:03.256 --> 20:07.554
<i> How do you feel?
- Well, actually good.</i>

20:08.117 --> 20:10.915
<i> Occasionally some pain in the stomach,
but otherwise ...</i>

20:11.577 --> 20:14.201
<i> What do you associate with the color blue? </i>

20:15.093 --> 20:19.221
<i>ammonia or chlorine might
as in a pool. </i>

20:19.901 --> 20:23.892
Congratulations, or something.
- I'll see you at the camp.

20:29.582 --> 20:33.242
So, fall in October 1940.
- Yes.

20:33.951 --> 20:37.136
and that would be about 15 ...

20:37.547 --> 20:40.864
And Roosevelt gave no
any attention to the woods.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.449
Nobody does that.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.143
People lose hope ...

20:44.144 --> 20:48.910
and spend all their time and I
mean all their time in the bios.

20:48.911 --> 20:52.547
Sitting staring as gnomes.
- And in the Emerald City.

20:52.548 --> 20:56.589
Indeed.
- How about the official records?

20:57.731 --> 21:02.307
Was the only credible
of myself. So I went to Friar.

21:02.308 --> 21:05.510
To see for yourself.
Spoke with a staff member.

21:05.511 --> 21:07.905
What did you think?

21:07.906 --> 21:12.586
They have not left everything behind.
Only the stuff they took.

21:12.587 --> 21:14.634
<i> Not the things you would expect. </i>

21:15.750 --> 21:19.024
<i> He said the evening dress was gone. </i>

21:19.607 --> 21:21.722
<i> hats, costumes and other things. </i>

21:21.723 --> 21:24.475
Melissa told us that only
after we took the hats.

21:25.096 --> 21:26.382
<i>He thought we  music
it had taken. </i>

21:26.829 --> 21:30.505
<i> On one of his old photos that he attended the
creek came back we just left </i>

21:32.088 --> 21:34.543
It's amateurish,
that's ridiculous.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.954
Just wait until we're sure.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.414
If you say ...

21:43.075 --> 21:44.414
Idiots.

21:45.249 --> 21:48.400
Coordinate 5 at 11.9 degrees
to the northwest.

21:54.486 --> 21:57.866
Coordinate 6 at 7.01 degrees
to the northwest.

22:04.953 --> 22:06.913
Coordinator: are you ready?
- Go on.

22:07.739 --> 22:11.859
Coordinate seven is 62 degrees,
it is now the North.

22:13.475 --> 22:14.799
Eight?

22:15.523 --> 22:17.680
Demonstrate eyes, I have to recalibrate.

22:26.753 --> 22:28.778
It tastes still nowhere.

22:31.537 --> 22:33.423
Take that hat off.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.284
I mean it.

22:48.235 --> 22:51.318
What?
- A problem.

23:00.048 --> 23:01.821
Have you made it much?

23:04.212 --> 23:06.690
<i> This is Teddy, do you hear me? </i>

23:08.598 --> 23:09.995
We are over.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.693
<i> GPS indicates that we are Quam over. </i>

23:14.841 --> 23:16.179
What did you say about?

23:16.641 --> 23:19.687
<i> Whatever.
Over and out. </i>

23:22.564 --> 23:26.590
Intern, where did we get here?

23:33.055 --> 23:36.037
Forty miles northwest of Florence.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.638
Would be a Tide Mill.

24:24.636 --> 24:26.141
Far away.

24:28.189 --> 24:29.999
Wind tunnel.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.480
Natural amphibian theater, anyone?

24:41.808 --> 24:45.092
<i> Hey, Jill the intern, where are we now? </i>

24:47.750 --> 24:49.463
Just outside Melbourne.

24:49.470 --> 24:54.773
<i>Hello  Melborne.
The dingo took my baby </i>

24:59.644 --> 25:03.864
<i>Object  four, this is day three.
First memory that comes to mind. </i>

25:03.865 --> 25:07.613
<i> My first cat, Reddy. </i>

25:07.614 --> 25:10.933
<i>Remember how  sounded Reddy
- Yes.</i>

25:11.648 --> 25:15.071
<i> Can you imitate that sound?
- Should I meow?</i>

25:15.072 --> 25:16.705
<i> Yes. </i>

25:39.499 --> 25:41.691
Stop the engine!

26:38.256 --> 26:40.143
I've heard.
- I heard it too.

26:40.144 --> 26:42.712
Oh, my God, oh my God,
Oh, my God, oh my God,

26:42.713 --> 26:44.586
Oh, my God, oh my God.

26:49.429 --> 26:54.298
<i> Theories, a: solar flares,
egomorfologie and magnetism. </i>

26:54.331 --> 26:57.969
<i>Two : human presence.
As Cy suggested. </i>

26:57.970 --> 27:00.248
<i>That we  thwarted by the FBI. </i>

27:00.281 --> 27:02.315
<i> Three: selective hallucination. </i>

27:02.316 --> 27:06.729
<i>We  the psychosis as
if it were a disease. Maybe far-fetched. </i>

27:06.730 --> 27:09.705
<i>But Daryl  and Walter's work with
indicate the noise levels on ...</i>

27:09.706 --> 27:11.551
<i>That the  the end of the road. </i>

27:12.097 --> 27:16.105
<i> Four: they are the people of the Friar.
- They are the "runners."</i>

27:16.643 --> 27:18.887
<i> In some ways they appear. </i>

27:19.579 --> 27:22.493
<i> This is what we know: "We're not crazy '</i>

27:22.984 --> 27:26.199
<i>Our instruments  store stampedes.
We are five days away </i>

27:26.200 --> 27:28.202
<i> from civilization with luggage. </i>

27:28.721 --> 27:30.287
<i>Three  no. </i>

27:30.990 --> 27:33.688
So here we are, this
meeting is officially ...

27:33.689 --> 27:36.621
the ability to go back.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.774
What?

27:38.643 --> 27:40.672
No, no, you can not be serious.

27:40.673 --> 27:44.517
For I am the one who proposes
to return.

27:44.518 --> 27:47.003
None of your theories explain the music.

27:47.509 --> 27:49.312
How do you explain the music?

27:49.903 --> 27:51.853
How can we all crazy,
I do not understand that.

27:51.854 --> 27:53.979
They listened to this music.

27:53.980 --> 27:56.558
Over and over again,
My grandfather told me that himself.

27:56.799 --> 27:59.481
You saw the film reels, they
were addicted to.

27:59.481 --> 28:01.206
Wait, take it easy.

28:01.734 --> 28:05.402
Jill, the intern said something funny
and I want more info.

28:05.465 --> 28:10.396
Intern, repeat, please.
- Ikabi, never mind.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.036
God!

28:13.134 --> 28:17.169
Theory five, "The act of God. "
- This is really ridiculous.

28:17.202 --> 28:19.652
What if the population of Friar
assumed that this ...

28:19.653 --> 28:22.149
"The way to God. "

28:23.383 --> 28:27.972
A magician, or something to stop the war.

28:27.973 --> 28:30.881
You can always magician
ask for something, right?

28:30.882 --> 28:32.789
Anything?
- No!

28:32.790 --> 28:36.323
Because if you was old enough to remember
The magician is a little bald dictator.

28:37.135 --> 28:40.235
Everyone must make its voice heard.
- Can you please stop it?

28:40.236 --> 28:45.372
I think we do not know what
going on here and we should go.

28:46.073 --> 28:47.289
I'm afraid.

28:47.945 --> 28:51.720
I think we should consider both.
- But Walter ...

28:52.569 --> 28:57.964
If there is an end, and there is something
or someone, what would you ask?

28:57.998 --> 29:00.490
This is a very personal question.

29:01.219 --> 29:06.148
What is your answer, Mr. Barnes?
- Ask him to smile at the camera.

29:07.242 --> 29:09.659
That's all I need.

29:27.748 --> 29:31.370
We both go.
- We do not know where North is.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.922
I call Northeast North.
17 degrees.

29:38.131 --> 29:38.828
How did you do that?

29:38.829 --> 29:41.170
Your sister said you tools
not do well.

29:41.171 --> 29:43.650
Yes, but I do.
That's the North.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.714
You can almost map-reading,
or you're not so good?

29:45.715 --> 29:48.695
I'm too good.
It's a triple magnetic force ...

29:49.448 --> 29:53.400
in the opposite direction, as
They flush toilets in Australia.

29:54.029 --> 29:56.015
Leads to the center?
- Yes.

29:56.637 --> 30:00.527
I think it comes from the music.
- Jill, I want to coordinate.

30:00.528 --> 30:01.875
Just like us.
- We have not yet.

30:01.876 --> 30:03.796
We have to go south.

30:03.797 --> 30:07.455
Okay, start preparing.
- I'm working on it.

30:15.258 --> 30:18.019
What is your full name?
- Liv Michelle McCann.

30:18.174 --> 30:20.776
Should I look at you or the camera?
- Look into the camera.

30:21.812 --> 30:23.285
<i> Where is you now? </i>

30:23.914 --> 30:26.698
<i>Daryl said we  100 km
In Yellow Brick Road are. </i>

30:27.186 --> 30:29.426
<i> We hear the music since yesterday morning. </i>

30:29.903 --> 30:31.990
<i> Say the alphabet backwards. </i>

30:33.462 --> 30:36.006
<i> Z, y, x, w, v, u, </i>

30:37.516 --> 30:40.238
<i> ... t
- That's enough.</i>

30:40.239 --> 30:41.675
<i> No, let me finish. </i>

30:41.783 --> 30:45.785
<i> V, u, t, s, r, </i>

30:49.882 --> 30:53.876
<i> Q, p, n, m, I, </i>

30:54.439 --> 30:57.976
<i> Damn!
What was there again for L </i>

30:59.703 --> 31:02.774
<i> L, k, j. .. </i>

31:03.769 --> 31:06.531
<i> i, h, j, f. .. </i>

31:06.532 --> 31:09.594
<i> e, d, c, b, a. </i>

31:13.921 --> 31:15.969
There's another one.

31:16.582 --> 31:18.726
Another intersection, people.

32:06.395 --> 32:09.730
What are you talking about?
- What do you think?

32:11.148 --> 32:12.797
I'm not going back.

32:14.219 --> 32:17.969
Not going back.
- I'm not going back.

32:21.618 --> 32:24.915
Your little heart goes so fast again.

32:25.797 --> 32:27.197
It is not small.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.787
<i> I think this is already the slope. </i>

32:50.923 --> 32:53.309
You're not where you are supposed to be about.

32:58.790 --> 33:00.597
Daryl, I know this should be fun ...

33:01.604 --> 33:03.360
but it is not.

33:04.619 --> 33:06.297
Take the hat off.

33:08.745 --> 33:10.502
<i> How do you feel now? </i>

33:11.133 --> 33:12.890
<i> I feel hondsmoe. </i>

33:14.141 --> 33:16.918
<i> talk in Hebrew
until I say you can stop. </i>

33:20.092 --> 33:21.635
<i>Well  stop. </i>

33:24.827 --> 33:27.535
<i>Repeat until the gesture
I say you can stop. </i>

33:31.352 --> 33:32.833
<i> Teddy </i>

33:47.434 --> 33:49.975
It's pretty good.
- Get your arm off me.

33:54.294 --> 33:56.123
I was just ...

33:58.924 --> 34:01.118
I missed the music.
That's all.

34:04.748 --> 34:06.389
Where it remained.

34:07.344 --> 34:08.956
When it comes back?

34:10.530 --> 34:13.338
We've heard it before,
you miss it?

34:13.991 --> 34:15.992
No.

34:22.422 --> 34:25.581
What did you see on the tapes?
- No, it's different for everyone.

34:26.125 --> 34:31.061
It's like separations, delays,
association, memory loss.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.666
So many people forget the way back.

34:35.426 --> 34:37.339
Daryl has the coordinates clearly
written down.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.491
I'm not talking about the way home.
I'm on the way back to the beginning.

34:40.492 --> 34:44.471
Who we were when we started.
- We are here, Walter.

34:46.346 --> 34:49.428
We are passed.
I'm sure.

34:49.429 --> 34:50.998
We have enough for the book.

34:51.713 --> 34:55.063
It's not about the book,
but for you. You always try ...

34:55.578 --> 34:58.708
things to get you
not even understand. You do not see.

34:59.569 --> 35:02.775
And this time it drives me really afraid.

35:07.694 --> 35:10.162
Why?
- Do you see this?

35:10.998 --> 35:12.188
Look carefully.

35:12.772 --> 35:14.835
Go on, everybody.

35:15.998 --> 35:19.929
Poisonous berries.
Atropa belladona.

35:20.805 --> 35:25.032
Night Shade.
Make sure you can keep them apart.

35:25.745 --> 35:28.224
Dangerous and poisonous berries.

35:28.225 --> 35:31.138
I ate him up.
I pressed him fine.

35:31.139 --> 35:34.978
It does not seem dangerous berry.
- Dangerous and poisonous berries.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.913
You know what?
We have earned a celebration.

35:54.156 --> 35:58.463
Okay, but look good,
I mean it.

35:59.723 --> 36:01.917
The fastest lighter, so.

36:04.281 --> 36:08.700
This will really happen.
Somebody get me some in the glass.

36:13.615 --> 36:17.069
<i> Put it on fire.
- Do not let it go out.</i>

36:17.070 --> 36:19.034
<i> Burn it.
- Do not let it go out.</i>

36:19.911 --> 36:24.280
<i> Jesus
- Ten times closer than I thought.</i>

36:25.924 --> 36:29.176
<i> Why do not we have a smooth
in case someone is cheating? </i>

36:29.594 --> 36:32.562
<i> These are questions for the magician,
ask him that. </i>

36:37.258 --> 36:38.645
<i> There are things ...</i>

36:39.374 --> 36:40.696
<i> I do not want to see. </i>

36:40.697 --> 36:45.351
<i> What are you talking about, it's good. </i>

36:46.764 --> 36:50.388
<i> I eat things.
- They look like hallucinations.</i>

36:51.670 --> 36:54.830
<i> We should know.
- There's no place like home.</i>

36:54.864 --> 36:58.267
<i> There is no place like home ...
- Guys.</i>

37:00.590 --> 37:03.310
Let me, I want to sleep.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.170
I lied.

37:11.769 --> 37:13.460
That's different, yes.

37:14.274 --> 37:17.523
I never knew my grandfather.
He lived in Maine.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.828
But I am grown up in Friar.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.298
Go to sleep now.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.797
You should have known.

37:30.517 --> 37:33.572
All that gevraag why they
went on the road.

37:33.573 --> 37:36.657
The people of Friar questions
is not it.

37:36.658 --> 37:39.612
If you live there you understand.

37:42.753 --> 37:45.783
It's not something you
a book about writing.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.935
<i> The first thing I asked Jill morning
was a childhood memory. </i>

38:33.060 --> 38:36.399
<i> She told me that it
the end of the Yellow Brick Road was. </i>

38:40.032 --> 38:43.072
We achieve the
end of the day, right?

38:44.609 --> 38:48.328
We take the hint?
- Give her one day.

38:50.285 --> 38:52.095
A day.

39:03.366 --> 39:04.835
Wait a minute.

39:07.847 --> 39:09.315
We must take sides.

39:10.028 --> 39:12.885
Argo and take the bowl
behind us?

39:16.584 --> 39:17.470
No, we wait.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.540
Come on.

39:22.772 --> 39:28.253
Everyone, this 15 minutes
ensure that we can continue.

39:43.312 --> 39:47.729
Your fingerprints are everywhere.
- "Your fingerprints are everywhere."

39:51.330 --> 39:53.477
You know, you look out lousy.

39:55.452 --> 39:58.015
Is it damaged?
- No.

39:58.016 --> 39:59.745
You have damaged the lamp.
- No.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.176
Is it damaged?
- No.

40:02.986 --> 40:04.377
Take the hat off.
- Is it damaged?

40:04.378 --> 40:08.371
Put that damn hat, I mean it.
Take that hat off.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.699
Give it to me. Take it off
and give it to me.

40:10.699 --> 40:14.078
Shut up and do the hat.
Take off!

40:14.080 --> 40:16.338
If you do not alter ...

41:15.756 --> 41:17.551
Daryl, no!

41:50.194 --> 41:51.710
He heads for the trees.
- Let me see.

41:51.711 --> 41:53.935
Stay there and be quiet.

41:53.936 --> 41:59.015
Jill, walk away. We walked ...
- What have you seen Walter?

41:59.016 --> 42:02.402
It killed her. Tore her to pieces.
- Why?

42:03.036 --> 42:05.769
They had a fight about that hat.

42:05.770 --> 42:09.224
What?
Walter, what happened?

42:11.006 --> 42:12.616
Listen to me all.

42:17.712 --> 42:20.751
Eric is dead.
- Yes.

42:32.766 --> 42:34.743
There is a terrible tragedy happened.

42:37.278 --> 42:40.251
Walter, you and I set up an emergency camp
here, and Teddy and Cy ...

42:40.742 --> 42:43.593
take the knife and collect whatever you can.

42:44.267 --> 42:46.925
Go find him.
- We just go home.

42:46.926 --> 42:50.190
Daryl knows the way to go home.
- He has done it often enough.

42:50.191 --> 42:52.001
He has no book.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.529
If we can find the way home.
I can find our way.

42:55.530 --> 42:56.489
I agree with Cy.

42:58.031 --> 43:02.094
Let the music stop!
- Scaremongering.

43:02.095 --> 43:04.099
Get him back.

43:29.059 --> 43:30.486
Seven.

43:31.565 --> 43:34.077
Let it go and find him.
- No ...

43:34.609 --> 43:36.513
No, we do not.

43:54.126 --> 43:55.264
Melissa.

43:56.147 --> 43:58.119
Melissa?
- What?

43:58.839 --> 44:01.741
Forget it.
- What is it, Jo?

44:02.440 --> 44:05.637
I wondered if I had a candy bar
should have.

44:07.954 --> 44:11.393
Well, I get it all.

44:12.183 --> 44:13.459
It's pretty good.

44:13.935 --> 44:17.978
It's all right, Jill. Teddy and Sarah
Daryl get back and then we go home.

44:17.979 --> 44:20.088
Do you believe me?
- I believe you.

44:20.089 --> 44:21.677
I do not.

44:23.566 --> 44:26.804
I water
and some help, right?

44:27.760 --> 44:31.832
We need to merge
and Mark, right?

44:31.833 --> 44:34.039
We can not leave.
- We go back.

44:34.435 --> 44:38.594
What are you looking?
- Something bright to the body marking.

44:39.229 --> 44:42.191
Liz is not alone.
- I do not care.

44:51.541 --> 44:53.440
They go through Aaron.

44:54.652 --> 44:57.507
Did you go see him this way?
- I think so.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.278
But I do not know what I saw.

45:00.803 --> 45:02.994
Oh God, let it stop.

45:03.673 --> 45:07.299
It seems it's doing that on purpose.
- Sure, instant.

45:15.862 --> 45:18.109
Did you know?
- I saw it too.

45:18.923 --> 45:20.028
I saw it.

45:21.017 --> 45:22.769
Turn that thing off.

45:28.669 --> 45:30.305
Daryl?

45:35.752 --> 45:37.484
Daryl, give me answers.

45:38.181 --> 45:41.594
We know you're there.
- Hello?

45:42.733 --> 45:47.547
<i> Guys, I think
I've done something really awful. </i>

45:47.548 --> 45:51.182
We know.
We know, and it's good.

45:53.230 --> 45:54.444
<i> I hurt my leg. </i>

45:54.463 --> 45:58.516
We will help you,
come here it's good.

46:03.145 --> 46:05.968
Daryl, I want you to good
I listen.

46:11.559 --> 46:13.071
<i> You're not in trouble. </i>

46:14.783 --> 46:16.271
<i> I know. </i>

46:17.416 --> 46:19.825
It seems like no one will forgive you.

46:20.855 --> 46:22.536
But you did wrong.

46:24.523 --> 46:28.253
Anyone who loves you
will forgive you.

46:30.647 --> 46:34.313
We thought it all that he says,
but then again not, Daryl.

46:34.457 --> 46:35.659
I ...

46:37.692 --> 46:41.627
I thought it all day long,
we all.

46:44.114 --> 46:45.486
I thought about killing him.

46:46.299 --> 46:48.578
I thought so too, Daryl.

46:49.205 --> 46:51.124
<i>Can you
not just leave? </i>

46:53.532 --> 46:55.518
<i> That you can not, do you? </i>

46:56.911 --> 47:02.573
Maybe we should get him.
- No, no, no. It is not necessary.

47:03.511 --> 47:07.673
I'm coming.
- That's good.

47:08.362 --> 47:10.741
That's right, Daryl, thanks.

47:12.919 --> 47:15.858
<i> I just tie a rope around your hands. </i>

47:15.939 --> 47:18.187
<i> This is a security measure, right? </i>

47:18.188 --> 47:23.185
Yes. That's better.

47:27.919 --> 47:29.178
That's it.

47:30.144 --> 47:32.577
Okay, Daryl.
- Tie me up.

47:34.224 --> 47:35.682
Now.

48:11.085 --> 48:13.170
I love him for a while in the holes.

48:20.625 --> 48:24.446
I feel my hands.
- I do not care.

48:25.105 --> 48:28.515
Tie the rope to loosen.

48:41.840 --> 48:45.869
I have questions about the coordinates.
- Do you like music, Teddy?

48:47.503 --> 48:51.786
Music has never been my thing.
But that song ...

48:52.522 --> 48:56.657
That song starts to get me in his power.
Begins in his power to get you?

48:58.962 --> 49:00.935
I hear the people and the music.

49:01.712 --> 49:07.117
I hear those who have walked the path.
- The coordinates.

49:07.118 --> 49:10.200
I can not our home.
- You can believe me, you.

49:10.749 --> 49:13.191
Look at the pages, Teddy.
I mean, look.

49:13.329 --> 49:17.452
Yesterday morning at 48.3 miles Pedo Meter ...

49:17.453 --> 49:21.055
and it turned out to be 29.2 miles
adding the coordinates when we ...

49:21.056 --> 49:23.790
and went to the South.

49:23.791 --> 49:26.212
The next morning
We at 8.45 of the camp

49:26.212 --> 49:31.401
8.2 miles from Pedo meter, while
There were 19 miles out.

49:32.429 --> 49:37.421
We looked at three miles further back, and we
saw the camp on the scope not even.

49:37.422 --> 49:42.624
The coordinates are correct, otherwise you would have
said anything, Aaron had said something.

49:42.890 --> 49:47.249
No, if you follow the yellow brick road
The coordinates are difficult.

49:48.185 --> 49:52.574
They count on, it becomes clear
as you go along.

49:53.036 --> 49:56.243
That's exactly how we make choices
by moving forward.

49:57.169 --> 49:59.174
Looking back is a different story.

50:00.034 --> 50:03.476
Looking back, looking at
page to page.

50:04.881 --> 50:06.491
The whole country is like ...

50:07.722 --> 50:10.279
liquid.
- Show me how it works.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.689
Look on the last page.

50:14.457 --> 50:18.802
So you come to the end of the path, Teddy.
Think it on.

51:01.663 --> 51:04.784
What does he do?
- I do not know, maybe nothing.

51:06.509 --> 51:08.856
I hear a pattern.
- You're kidding.

51:12.986 --> 51:17.600
We can not make it disappear?

51:25.828 --> 51:27.696
You talk too much.
- Go away.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.421
Please, get out.

55:24.987 --> 55:27.070
Useless.

55:33.359 --> 55:34.759
That's the way home.

55:35.880 --> 55:37.766
He wrote it down.
- Stay tuned!

55:37.767 --> 55:40.559
Daryl was an analyst, so the
coordinates are all arranged.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.180
No, it is there.

55:43.365 --> 55:46.158
This is the way back, here it is,
He wrote it down.

55:46.159 --> 55:48.681
I swear to God ...
- You do not.

55:52.709 --> 55:53.976
None of you know me.

55:54.635 --> 55:57.697
You do not even look at me.
- Okay, it's good.

55:57.698 --> 56:01.620
He left behind some equipment, but
we can survive, trust me.

56:01.621 --> 56:03.970
Lady, do you make a joke?

56:03.971 --> 56:06.067
Oh, I am now a "lady"
- Yes, you.

56:06.068 --> 56:09.101
You have even forgotten my name?
- Take it easy.

56:09.102 --> 56:13.231
Do not say that to me.
- Keep your hands off me.

56:15.241 --> 56:17.906
Another reason why we
a word from you to listen?

56:17.907 --> 56:20.124
Because everything comes true.

56:20.292 --> 56:22.896
Teddy and I have to
Siberia looked in the desert.

56:22.897 --> 56:24.381
It means nothing.

56:24.382 --> 56:28.035
What is your plan?
- She did not.

56:29.208 --> 56:33.315
We must stay together, eating
ration and drinking, and then we go.

56:34.097 --> 56:38.128
Not on the path. Let the path dislocate.
To the south. We leave tomorrow morning.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.030
We have the stuff is not it?
- No.

56:40.667 --> 56:43.443
As I see it we go to the west.
- West?

56:43.444 --> 56:45.998
I know there is nothing in the East and
even less in the North, but the West.

56:45.999 --> 56:48.319
It's a better chance.
Maybe we come against them in Vermont.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.461
I'm not very comfortable.
- You have had the chance to talk.

56:52.258 --> 56:54.952
I am talking.
- Bullshit.

56:57.141 --> 56:58.928
Want a reason?
I have a reason that it matters!

56:58.929 --> 57:02.815
I have this knife!
That distinction, I do not take our roads.

57:03.501 --> 57:05.882
I can make a way through the wilderness,
can kill a beast ...

57:06.578 --> 57:10.290
or a complete fool with my machete ...

57:10.291 --> 57:12.494
in an off-road driving.

57:14.335 --> 57:16.249
I'm not wait until tomorrow.

57:17.381 --> 57:20.632
I want to know what Teddy think of it.

57:25.065 --> 57:26.898
I think we're heading north
must go further.

57:28.418 --> 57:31.891
Really? It is not an option.
No further north.

57:32.222 --> 57:37.679
Think we should go home with answers.
These questions cost us our lives.

57:38.209 --> 57:42.484
These questions were never asked.

57:42.485 --> 57:44.162
It does not matter anyway.

57:59.111 --> 58:00.434
He's fine.

58:03.344 --> 58:05.247
He fell, but there's nothing wrong.

58:08.119 --> 58:09.031
We go to the south.

58:09.338 --> 58:11.323
Liv and I go to the west
tonight, with or without you.

58:11.324 --> 58:14.116
I'm going to personally kill.
but ...

58:15.249 --> 58:17.343
This does not die with you ...

58:17.344 --> 58:21.303
anyway because they are denied.

58:21.690 --> 58:25.650
And I do not belong to
of a democracy now ...

58:25.651 --> 58:27.685
I promise you.

58:31.986 --> 58:34.302
We need to distribute the stuff.

58:41.412 --> 58:45.916
Take the flashlight.
This is ours. The flashlight ...

58:46.480 --> 58:48.077
is yours.

58:50.409 --> 58:52.083
And the water?
- I need you.

58:52.084 --> 58:53.326
That we also need.

58:54.812 --> 58:56.891
Do not let this happen.

59:25.267 --> 59:26.987
We must stand guard.

01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:22.214
Stay with me.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.979
Stay with me.

01:00:29.462 --> 01:00:31.938
Thomas, he is too far away.

01:00:32.277 --> 01:00:36.573
Thomas, they see us,
Please stay with me.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.217
Where are you, I do not feel?
- I'm here.

01:00:54.763 --> 01:00:57.405
Near you.
- That's better.

01:00:57.406 --> 01:01:01.264
I dreamed that we arrived home
but it was no longer there.

01:01:03.065 --> 01:01:06.458
It's good.
- It was gone.

01:01:07.258 --> 01:01:10.154
The grass was black and sky filled with smoke.

01:01:10.864 --> 01:01:14.169
And I was there but I was dead.

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:19.854
Everyone was dead and gone.

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:23.207
And I was really scared.

01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:28.135
It was the worst time
I woke up because ...

01:01:29.722 --> 01:01:32.103
what if this path is now our home?

01:02:58.724 --> 01:03:04.312
Focuses on three properties and make sure
you keep a straight line.

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:14.333
You're doing fine, really.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.206
Here.

01:03:21.147 --> 01:03:25.016
No.
- Take it. I catch a squirrel later.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.211
Why do not darker than this?
- I do not know.

01:03:41.037 --> 01:03:43.795
Are we ever head north?
- You can forget.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.256
Dangerous berries.

01:04:02.686 --> 01:04:03.679
Yes.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:07.019
Not eat them.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:10.282
I've tried.

01:04:11.042 --> 01:04:15.009
I am not died, but ...

01:04:16.773 --> 01:04:19.933
You get get high.
- Is that so?

01:04:23.995 --> 01:04:26.207
Really really stupid thing to do.

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:30.844
Too much poison, and you get in a daze.

01:05:10.404 --> 01:05:13.590
I love this song great!

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:17.290
I think it's beautiful, really beautiful.

01:05:19.634 --> 01:05:21.438
I want to walk.

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:27.704
No, no, too dangerous.
We stay here.

01:05:29.406 --> 01:05:32.143
Can I touch your hair?
- Okay.

01:05:41.279 --> 01:05:44.577
Are you sure we can not walk?
A few more kilometers.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:52.382
Oh, my God, look!
A squirrel.

01:05:57.337 --> 01:06:01.623
Have you eaten?
- I did.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:05.005
I pressed it a few fine
on've tasted.

01:06:06.343 --> 01:06:08.545
How it tasted.
- Bloody.

01:06:10.237 --> 01:06:12.031
Yes, it is.

01:06:13.919 --> 01:06:16.970
I'll kiss you, that's good right?

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:19.218
No.

01:06:20.739 --> 01:06:22.496
Really?
- No, Cy.

01:06:30.727 --> 01:06:32.078
It was North Dakota.

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:34.303
I do not?

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:36.821
Then we have that woman
bribe to let the dogs.

01:06:36.822 --> 01:06:38.668
She would not give for this trip.

01:06:38.669 --> 01:06:41.116
Teddy had hives and hives
received from the hot tub.

01:06:41.116 --> 01:06:43.017
I believe it.

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:48.641
Mickey will soon die.
Lilian also it is unreliable.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:52.096
They will not notice that we do not
have come home.

01:06:52.097 --> 01:06:54.458
He sits there for days
crying in the dark.

01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:55.628
Stop it, Teddy ...

01:06:56.471 --> 01:07:00.194
He'll be fine.
We are now on their way home.

01:07:01.286 --> 01:07:04.163
Here, do not listen to.
But take it.

01:07:07.002 --> 01:07:08.637
These are good.

01:07:10.974 --> 01:07:12.097
Ms. Taylor?

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:16.453
Pacman picked up,
Christmas was good.

01:07:18.557 --> 01:07:20.465
Third grade, Ms. Scott.

01:07:21.021 --> 01:07:24.168
Channel hairy.
I can check a box in one week.

01:07:24.986 --> 01:07:27.516
I love Bradly,
but he does not know.

01:07:29.434 --> 01:07:30.786
I think I love him.

01:07:30.787 --> 01:07:34.852
Let's see if I can find the way back.
Holidays in Cape Corn.

01:07:36.445 --> 01:07:38.280
I love the beach.

01:07:46.825 --> 01:07:47.718
Are you ...

01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:50.860
What?

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.663
Are you angry ...

01:07:55.722 --> 01:07:56.714
on me?

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.458
No.

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:06.040
It's just hard.

01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:09.943
Can you help me?

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:12.787
How?

01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:17.848
To summarize it all.

01:08:20.593 --> 01:08:22.446
We walk right now.

01:08:26.876 --> 01:08:29.996
We walk seems like an eternity.

01:08:30.758 --> 01:08:32.738
Yes.
- But that's not true.

01:08:35.482 --> 01:08:39.434
We were part of a group
people who walked to the North.

01:08:40.334 --> 01:08:44.368
Because we wondered why
Another group went to the North.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:53.220
We are all ever born
and we all die.

01:08:54.526 --> 01:08:58.076
We have done many things in between.
Like this.

01:08:58.736 --> 01:09:00.763
Sometimes we have a job.

01:09:01.411 --> 01:09:02.761
Like you had a job.

01:09:03.249 --> 01:09:06.267
And your job was walking down this road.

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:12.517
I lived alone and sold popcorn.

01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:19.238
And I lied because I knew it.

01:09:21.107 --> 01:09:22.693
I think I have always known.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.296
If you live in a city long enough
you know the real reason why you are walking.

01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:31.118
Just as I feel
your eyes are focused on me,

01:09:31.118 --> 01:09:33.179
while I can not even be seen.

01:09:33.807 --> 01:09:35.953
You always know that the path is there.

01:09:36.804 --> 01:09:39.781
Everyone knows the
and nobody says.

01:09:40.734 --> 01:09:43.493
You're ashamed because it can be.

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:46.977
A way out.

01:09:54.122 --> 01:09:56.886
You feel that the path you will understand.

01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:00.636
I think that's the worst.

01:10:02.218 --> 01:10:03.949
That it does.

01:10:11.359 --> 01:10:13.638
Tomorrow we reach the mountains are.

01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:21.826
Hey guys,
check this out.

01:10:22.428 --> 01:10:24.211
Not really.
Have you already had all the time?

01:10:24.212 --> 01:10:27.349
We need to distribute the food.
- And no one yet knows.

01:10:34.755 --> 01:10:36.650
Please?

01:10:37.861 --> 01:10:39.296
We are on rations, okay?

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.951
We still have a long way to go.

01:11:33.092 --> 01:11:34.753
I'm sorry.

01:11:36.354 --> 01:11:38.351
I was so hungry.

01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:49.715
I'm sorry!

01:12:49.215 --> 01:12:51.134
<i> It happens to me. </i>

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:56.157
What has happened to Daryl?

01:13:03.801 --> 01:13:05.911
Go to sleep now.
- No.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:11.534
As the music continues,
and we do not quickly find a village ...

01:13:15.574 --> 01:13:19.431
I'm something unspeakable with you.

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:22.883
Like what?

01:13:27.779 --> 01:13:30.456
I thought of kilometers ago.

01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:33.665
All those things I'm doing.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.251
I thought about suicide,
but ...

01:13:41.692 --> 01:13:45.597
If I was going to cut somewhere in
that I would get confused.

01:13:51.462 --> 01:13:54.059
Grab the rope, honey.

01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:32.403
Teddy?
Sign up, Teddy.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.867
Bastard!

01:15:11.694 --> 01:15:14.013
This is the song, right?

01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:19.462
This is a fluke.
- It calls me.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.450
Do not leave me.

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:27.945
I do not.

01:15:30.415 --> 01:15:31.836
Walter ...

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:38.353
How did you find anybody?

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.089
I can not answer that.

01:15:45.298 --> 01:15:50.084
So you're our best friend
been with Teddy and me ...

01:15:50.085 --> 01:15:52.561
In all these years?

01:16:00.612 --> 01:16:02.800
Is not that amazing?

01:16:05.472 --> 01:16:08.344
Everything changes when you are deep in
your heart think you tomorrow

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:12.007
maybe die.

01:16:13.354 --> 01:16:14.601
Are you sure?

01:16:16.816 --> 01:16:17.577
Yes.

01:16:21.129 --> 01:16:23.893
However small, these trees are.

01:16:51.346 --> 01:16:54.278
I can go beg in the end,
but you should just work.

01:16:55.468 --> 01:17:00.104
Do not like the others,
am not trying to persuade.

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:03.154
I do not talk anymore.

01:17:11.983 --> 01:17:14.405
Do I stabbing you down?
- No.

01:17:14.883 --> 01:17:17.340
No, I want my blood on that knife.

01:17:17.671 --> 01:17:18.863
What do you want?

01:17:19.689 --> 01:17:21.445
You have to break my neck.

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.525
I do not know how.

01:17:24.319 --> 01:17:26.238
You take down my neck, and turns.

01:17:26.304 --> 01:17:29.234
I'm not strong enough.
- Yes, you are, anyone can.

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:31.980
But I do not.
- Somewhere inside you can.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:34.320
You must find your place in
that it can.

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:38.283
Sorry Liz, but
find the place that it wants to do.

01:18:50.277 --> 01:18:51.368
Not stop!

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.333
Please, oh, God.

01:19:07.557 --> 01:19:09.227
Walter!

01:19:15.223 --> 01:19:16.825
Walter ...

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:40.371
I'm sorry, view the recording.

01:19:43.492 --> 01:19:47.709
<i> Melissa, I hope you forgive me. </i>

01:19:48.052 --> 01:19:50.590
<i> I've seen too much. </i>

01:19:50.636 --> 01:19:54.036
<i> It's time for me to go. </i>

01:19:55.522 --> 01:20:00.457
<i> I know you really
not want to see, it's just that </i>

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:02.936
<i> the timeline I know ...</i>

01:20:04.187 --> 01:20:06.604
<i> I know you're here with me. </i>

01:20:07.338 --> 01:20:08.761
<i> Thus ...</i>

01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:12.431
<i> Stay with me. </i>

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.267
<i>Do not look away . </i>

01:20:34.689 --> 01:20:35.748
<i> What's your name? </i>

01:20:37.336 --> 01:20:40.676
<i> My name is Walter. </i>

01:20:41.999 --> 01:20:43.289
<i> How do you feel now? </i>

01:20:46.662 --> 01:20:47.721
<i> lot better. </i>

01:20:49.393 --> 01:20:51.343
<i> My earliest memories as a child ...</i>

01:20:53.905 --> 01:20:56.637
<i> over the bars of my bed to climb </i>

01:20:57.489 --> 01:21:00.092

01:21:15.185 --> 01:21:16.957
<i> Say ...</i>

01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:20.761
<i>Stop . </i>

01:21:28.138 --> 01:21:29.734
<i>Stop . </i>

01:21:32.395 --> 01:21:34.251
<i>Stop . </i>

01:21:36.939 --> 01:21:38.449
<i>Stop . </i>

01:22:22.409 --> 01:22:24.813
Where have you landed?

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.409
Teddy?

01:22:51.117 --> 01:22:52.732
Teddy?

01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:10.323
Teddy, can you hear me?

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:19.144
Leave me here alone.
I'm trapped here and do not ...

01:23:19.145 --> 01:23:20.810
I do not ...

01:23:26.373 --> 01:23:28.688
If you had to go ...

01:23:29.482 --> 01:23:31.137
If you had to go ...

01:23:33.418 --> 01:23:35.821
Then you had me that morning
awake to make.

01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:39.702
I had gone with you.

01:23:49.888 --> 01:23:51.146
Melissa.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:54.692
I want you to know I'm here.

01:23:55.643 --> 01:24:00.715
Where?
- In the cave behind you.

01:24:05.215 --> 01:24:06.657
Going on the run?

01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:11.386
I would not run for you.

01:24:12.124 --> 01:24:13.436
Why not?

01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.463
With my sore leg I
You might have a chance.

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:23.392
Will you kill me?
Here? Now?

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.608
Yes.

01:24:27.225 --> 01:24:30.878
Please, Daryl.
Should it do so much?

01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:32.528
Yes.

01:24:34.406 --> 01:24:35.993
Here we go.

01:24:41.781 --> 01:24:45.246
Melissa, are you there?

01:24:48.495 --> 01:24:50.942
I heard you on a
Somehow ...

01:24:53.168 --> 01:24:55.275
If you hear me, maybe ...

01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:03.873
I'm somewhere on the map
I do not know.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.860
I can not read the coordinates ...

01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:15.582
I can not trust the coordinates.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.463
You think it ... but the trick is that no
an end to it.

01:25:28.803 --> 01:25:30.994
But here's the wind.

01:25:40.948 --> 01:25:42.399
Melissa ...

01:25:43.298 --> 01:25:44.818
Are you there?

01:25:46.902 --> 01:25:51.929
Are you asleep?
You lie somewhere to sleep without me?

01:25:55.005 --> 01:25:57.298
I hope you like the way
home find.

01:25:58.818 --> 01:25:59.635
Where it's hot ...

01:26:03.902 --> 01:26:05.753
and waiting for you.

01:26:07.213 --> 01:26:10.121
I hope you give us
Life can still remember.

01:26:13.493 --> 01:26:15.445
I hear the music now.

01:26:18.157 --> 01:26:20.637
And you will be at Walter ...

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:25.464
Walter will be happy too.

01:26:30.495 --> 01:26:34.120
Do not think back to Brian.

01:26:35.103 --> 01:26:38.975
Imagine never where I am.

01:26:40.944 --> 01:26:44.033
And let no one a liar.

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:52.553
And one day ..

01:26:53.191 --> 01:26:57.289
One day you will not
more of me thinking ...

01:26:59.035 --> 01:27:00.293
Not even for me to curse.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:09.784
I have loved you.

01:27:11.834 --> 01:27:14.811
Go home.

01:29:25.815 --> 01:29:26.907
Help.

01:29:28.924 --> 01:29:30.114
Someone ...

01:29:34.183 --> 01:29:36.066
Am I the only one here?

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:49.429
No, sir, I am also.

01:29:49.694 --> 01:29:53.204
Who are you?
- I play the movies, of course.

01:29:53.398 --> 01:29:56.010
You must help me ...
Please, listen to me.

01:29:56.044 --> 01:29:57.265
Listen to me.
- I listen!

01:29:57.266 --> 01:29:58.486
There are others.
- Yes.

01:29:58.887 --> 01:30:02.242
I need help finding them.
You must understand, I left them behind.

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:04.610
They no longer need your help.

01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:09.051
How do you know?
- Because I've seen.

01:30:11.721 --> 01:30:12.944
Is that so?

01:30:14.751 --> 01:30:16.006
Please ...

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:18.038
What happened to her?

01:30:18.303 --> 01:30:20.915
Oh, Ms. Barnes?
I've just seen her.

01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:23.477
Did you know?
Is she here?

01:30:25.314 --> 01:30:27.298
Is it the end?

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:30.010
Indeed, sir,
she has reached the end.

01:30:31.664 --> 01:30:34.574
But there are so many ends ...

01:30:37.848 --> 01:30:40.759
Enjoy your movies, Mr. Barnes.

01:30:47.704 --> 01:30:49.954
Sit down, sir!
