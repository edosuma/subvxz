00:14.136 --> 00:16.386
Look, my parents probably won't even ask,

00:16.386 --> 00:19.299
but if they do, I spent the 
night at your house, ok?

00:20.945 --> 00:22.198
Damn,

00:22.953 --> 00:25.497
got two dangles on my ass.

00:25.497 --> 00:26.904
I'll call you back.

00:28.681 --> 00:31.229
I'm not even going that fast.

00:51.815 --> 00:55.195
Officer I think I'm lost.

01:12.359 --> 01:13.194
You made good time.

01:13.194 --> 01:15.155
Yeah yeah, I

01:16.101 --> 01:19.942
I rolled out as soon as 
I got the call. Oh, no.

01:19.942 --> 01:22.176
What? Did you know him?

01:24.721 --> 01:26.806
Yeah, his name is Dan Cofield,

01:26.806 --> 01:29.722
I worked on a case with 
him a few years ago.

01:30.062 --> 01:32.132
He's got a wife and kids.

01:38.679 --> 01:40.819
H / Yeah.

01:40.819 --> 01:43.607
Girl says officer Cofield pulled her over,

01:43.607 --> 01:45.724
walked up already covered in blood.

01:45.724 --> 01:46.787
Collapsed right in front of her.

01:46.787 --> 01:47.870
Is that her right there?

01:47.870 --> 01:50.612
Yeah, the name's Maloire Jacobs.

01:50.612 --> 01:52.005
She didn't do it though.

01:52.344 --> 01:55.130
I checked in and around her car,
and no gun, no casings.

01:55.130 --> 01:56.842
Swabbed her hand for GSR.

01:56.842 --> 01:58.299
Unless she's the greatest 
actress in the world,

01:58.299 --> 02:00.039
the kid's telling the truth.

02:00.039 --> 02:02.383
Ok, let's call in all shifts.

02:02.645 --> 02:04.258
They hit one of us,

02:05.362 --> 02:06.724
they hit us all.

02:55.435 --> 02:56.996
He took two in the vest Alexx?

02:56.996 --> 02:58.269
Uh hmm,

02:58.269 --> 03:00.531
class two vest did it's job.

03:00.531 --> 03:02.775
Stopped these bullets from penetrating.

03:03.215 --> 03:04.576
So what killed him?

03:04.576 --> 03:08.665
Well, vests can't stop it if it doesn't cover.

03:10.298 --> 03:12.345
Bullet entered his upper torso,

03:12.731 --> 03:14.511
penetrated his lung.

03:16.082 --> 03:19.035
Bloody foam around the mouth 
indicates pulmonary edema.

03:19.035 --> 03:20.909
Lung's filled with fluid.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.492
Poor boy couldn't breathe.

03:22.492 --> 03:23.840
So that explains why he couldn't use the

03:23.840 --> 03:26.499
radio to call for help, right? / Yeah

03:35.757 --> 03:37.661
I'll know more when I finish my post.

03:37.661 --> 03:39.790
Ok. Thank you.

03:42.213 --> 03:44.527
Three bullets struck in the 
passenger-side door.

03:44.527 --> 03:45.902
They're all 38 caliber.

03:45.902 --> 03:47.662
Cofield get a shot though?

03:47.662 --> 03:48.824
His magazine's missing five rounds but

03:48.824 --> 03:50.929
I haven't seen any casings.

03:50.929 --> 03:52.624
My guess is he was shot somewhere else.

03:52.624 --> 03:55.620
That coroborates our witness' 
story about the stop.

03:55.620 --> 03:58.726
So I guess this isn't our 
primary crime scene.

04:01.545 --> 04:04.171
Right now, it's the only thing we've got.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.921
I've got blood in here.

04:09.425 --> 04:12.332
Something definitely went 
on in the back of this car.

04:13.029 --> 04:16.365
I wanna see what happened at the
front with this on-board camera.

04:24.943 --> 04:26.484
This tape plays on a loop.

04:26.484 --> 04:28.214
It's activated when you hit the light bar,

04:28.214 --> 04:31.337
so we might be able to get something off of it.

04:31.659 --> 04:33.439
Our victim, officer Dan Cofield had

04:33.439 --> 04:36.940
four traffic stops last night, 
not counting the girl.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.203
You wanna start with the most 
recent and work backward?

04:39.203 --> 04:40.202
Sure.

04:42.539 --> 04:44.149
I wonder why he called this guy over.

04:44.149 --> 04:46.211
Will you check the MDT log?

04:51.788 --> 04:54.990
Now there's no Mobile Data Terminal entry

04:54.990 --> 04:57.363
corresponding with this time stamp.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.611
He never logged the stop? 
That's strange.

04:59.611 --> 05:01.191
It's worse than strange.

05:01.191 --> 05:03.675
It's the type of thing to get your days off.

05:07.171 --> 05:10.287
Why are they walking to 
the back of the radio car?

05:11.620 --> 05:12.988
What was that?

05:12.988 --> 05:15.823
Something's happening behind the camera.

05:16.844 --> 05:18.952
May be a little baton therapy?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.832
Could explain the blood and 
hair we found on the cage.

05:24.102 --> 05:26.091
The plates are current.
Will you run them?

05:35.013 --> 05:38.418
Fred Rutter. Address in Hialeah.

05:38.865 --> 05:40.907
He's the same guy from the video.

05:42.074 --> 05:43.148
I wasn't there.

05:43.563 --> 05:46.479
Well we have DNA proof. 
Blood and hair.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.828
Do you wanna tell us 
why he pulled you over?

05:50.133 --> 05:52.155
It's personal. Mr.Rutter,

05:52.155 --> 05:53.798
the murder of a police officer

05:53.798 --> 05:55.887
is more personal than you can imagine.

05:55.887 --> 05:58.993
Murder? Oh, woa, hey,

05:58.993 --> 06:00.469
I didn't kill any cop.

06:00.469 --> 06:01.753
I didn't even touch him.

06:01.753 --> 06:04.160
You are our number one suspect.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.118
I suggest that you start talking right now.

06:09.242 --> 06:12.286
Look, Cofield lives across
the street from me.

06:12.286 --> 06:13.761
He's always hasseling me about my dogs

06:13.761 --> 06:16.468
barking and fixing the bikes on the lawn.

06:16.468 --> 06:17.791
So I told him off.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.569
And look at this!
He went Rodney King on me!

06:19.569 --> 06:21.963
Why didn't you file a complaint 
with the police department?

06:21.963 --> 06:23.578
Are you kidding me?

06:24.173 --> 06:25.938
I know how you guys work.

06:25.938 --> 06:27.901
Blew all the silence,

06:27.901 --> 06:29.679
backing each other's play, come on!

06:29.679 --> 06:31.192
Actually it doesn't work like that.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.621
Yeah, right.

06:32.621 --> 06:34.875
Can anybody vouch for your 
whereabouts last night?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.913
I dunno, about 300 people 
at the shore club.

06:36.913 --> 06:38.405
I work closing.

06:38.405 --> 06:40.108
One more thing.

06:41.121 --> 06:42.984
That blood on your watch.
I'm curious about it.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.590
Where did it come from.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.494
Well, it's probably mine after 
what that maniac did to me.

06:48.494 --> 06:51.173
Calleigh, check his watch,

06:51.173 --> 06:53.279
and then check his story.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.597
Mike, escort me would ya?

08:35.428 --> 08:37.490
Eric! / H!

08:38.895 --> 08:42.352
Listen, I followed markings from 
the muffler to this location.

08:42.715 --> 08:46.253
Found blood, casings, and 
uh, some tread marks.

08:46.253 --> 08:47.800
Found our shooting scene. Excellent.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.331
There's only one problem.

08:49.331 --> 08:50.460
The IAB.

08:51.463 --> 08:53.796
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

08:53.796 --> 08:54.799
Rick!

08:57.182 --> 08:58.639
You're in my crime scene.

08:59.098 --> 09:00.738
Actually, you're in mine Horatio.

09:00.738 --> 09:04.153
I take it that Internal Affairs 
guys have developed

09:04.153 --> 09:06.103
a fascination with forensics.

09:06.103 --> 09:08.100
Ah, that's good. I'll remember that.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.532
What are you doing here?

09:09.532 --> 09:10.688
Saw the report this AM,

09:10.688 --> 09:13.581
Danny Cofield was working outside 
his assigned patrol area.

09:13.581 --> 09:15.343
So, you're ahead of the curve.
That's sexy.

09:15.343 --> 09:16.991
We've both got a job to do.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.412
I expect to be copied on every 
part of this investigation.

09:19.412 --> 09:20.683
I will be kept in the loop?

09:20.683 --> 09:22.329
A police officer has been killed,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.547
and I need to take a look at that, now!

09:27.924 --> 09:29.966
Hi / Hey.

09:29.966 --> 09:31.322
Pick you up at eight?

09:31.986 --> 09:33.435
Got reservations at "Touch".

09:33.435 --> 09:35.977
- That sounds good.
- Alright, bye bye.

09:42.189 --> 09:45.322
So..., wow!

09:45.659 --> 09:47.626
Yeah, me and Stetler.

09:48.609 --> 09:50.285
When did that happen?

09:50.285 --> 09:52.333
He asked me out, I said yes.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.491
That's usually how it works.

09:59.172 --> 10:01.319
Stetler is simple,

10:01.319 --> 10:04.051
and this is just,

10:04.051 --> 10:05.663
comlicated. / Yeah.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.784
Complicated.

10:12.581 --> 10:15.469
You had a daughter you 
didn't tell me about.

10:18.212 --> 10:20.731
Makes it kinda hard to trust you.

10:23.968 --> 10:25.739
I understand.

10:51.974 --> 10:52.790
Eric!

10:53.151 --> 10:55.811
All the blood evidence on the scene H.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.785
That means that Dan Cofield 
was shot right here.

10:59.785 --> 11:03.130
Yeah, traveled a half mile  across town.

11:03.508 --> 11:05.491
Blood drops to the left of the tracks

11:05.491 --> 11:08.177
put him on the driver's 
side of the radio car.

11:08.177 --> 11:10.889
So we have five rounds 
missing from his magazine.

11:10.889 --> 11:13.689
Yeah, 9 mil, standard MDPD issue.

11:13.689 --> 11:16.793
The rounds are discharged  
back and to the right,

11:16.793 --> 11:19.820
which means he used the 
patrol car to shield  himself.

11:23.071 --> 11:26.078
I found two other sets of tire  tracks.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.490
Fresh rubber on all of them.

11:28.490 --> 11:29.453
Ok. Means they were in a hurry.

11:29.453 --> 11:31.298
Do we have a vehicle type?

11:31.298 --> 11:34.808
Dunno, farthest set's wide,
intricate tread.

11:34.808 --> 11:36.122
May be an expensive car,

11:36.122 --> 11:38.181
but definitely an expensive tyre.

11:38.181 --> 11:40.556
The others are single tread and narrow.

11:40.556 --> 11:42.205
Motorcycle and a high end car.

11:42.205 --> 11:43.939
What were they doing here?

11:43.939 --> 11:46.356
I dunno, nothing legal that's for sure.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.027
You think Cofield was 
into something dirty?

11:48.027 --> 11:49.423
I don't know Eric.

11:49.423 --> 11:50.929
I hope not.

12:08.691 --> 12:09.709
What is it now?

12:09.709 --> 12:11.649
Just thought I'd return your watch.

12:11.649 --> 12:13.919
Well, it's nice of you to 
go out of your way.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.920
You know Mr. Rutter, 
I'm not entirely convinced that officer

12:16.920 --> 12:19.849
Cofield was angry at you for
the reasons you mentioned.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.865
There are no motorcycles on the lawn,

12:21.865 --> 12:23.336
there are no dogs.

12:23.336 --> 12:25.483
The blood on the watch isn't 
yours or  officer Cofield's.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.724
It's female.

12:27.017 --> 12:28.758
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:28.758 --> 12:30.301
Why did you lie?

12:31.154 --> 12:33.048
Who's that? Excuse me. Miss!

12:33.048 --> 12:34.597
Yeah, it's ok honey.

12:35.719 --> 12:38.587
Can I speak to you for a moment, outside?

12:41.583 --> 12:42.566
It's ok

12:45.191 --> 12:46.195
Here's your watch.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.729
My name's Calleigh,

12:53.729 --> 12:55.616
I'm with Miami-Dade PD.

12:55.616 --> 12:57.755
How did you hurt your lip?

13:00.018 --> 13:02.634
How did you hurt your lip?

13:05.862 --> 13:07.167
I fell down.

13:08.425 --> 13:10.275
Your hands aren't hurt.

13:10.275 --> 13:14.446
Didn't you try to protect
yourself when you fell?

13:16.620 --> 13:19.198
I'm sorry. I don't want any trouble.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.972
I'm sorry.

13:31.999 --> 13:33.948
If you need help.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.196
I got your page.

13:52.196 --> 13:53.765
You were right Calleigh.

13:53.765 --> 13:56.506
The DNA from your hankerchief,

13:56.506 --> 13:58.836
matches the DNA collected from the watch.

13:58.836 --> 14:00.098
I hate that.

14:00.098 --> 14:01.941
She won't talk because she's afraid.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.887
It's probably an illegal

14:03.887 --> 14:05.030
I guess officer Cofield tried to

14:05.030 --> 14:07.079
give Fred a taste of his own medicine.

14:07.079 --> 14:08.459
Is he our cop-killer?

14:08.459 --> 14:10.043
No, his alibi checks out.

14:10.043 --> 14:12.611
He's a sleezebag of a different variety.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.387
You know, I couldn't enter the 
house under domestic violence,

14:15.387 --> 14:16.919
because I didn't have any hard evidence

14:16.919 --> 14:19.090
or the cooperation of the victim,

14:19.702 --> 14:22.205
but I think with this, 
I could get him on assault.

15:03.122 --> 15:05.620
Hey, copied these for  you.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.826
Got lucky on the gum from the radio car.

15:07.826 --> 15:08.881
Somebody left DNA?

15:08.881 --> 15:10.817
Hmm, three somebodies.

15:11.629 --> 15:12.719
You're kidding me.

15:12.719 --> 15:14.453
First donor is female, saliva.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.874
She's our gum chewer.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.179
Alright, CODISed it?

15:18.179 --> 15:19.393
Notta.

15:19.959 --> 15:21.746
Alright, how about the other two somebodies.

15:21.746 --> 15:25.058
Not saliva, not female.

15:26.077 --> 15:27.548
Semen?

15:28.526 --> 15:30.982
I guess we weren't the only 
ones who got lucky.

15:30.982 --> 15:32.572
You would say that.

15:32.985 --> 15:35.422
Male samples got trapped in the gum.

15:35.422 --> 15:37.907
I'm thinking she chewed  it after.

15:37.907 --> 15:39.726
Right, she's living dangerously.

15:39.968 --> 15:43.169
Probably some hooker lost 
her gum during transport.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.463
Tamyra, the gum was found in the front seat.

15:52.761 --> 15:56.911
Why would he be transporting 
a hooker in the front... oh.

15:58.341 --> 16:01.885
Listen hmm, you  know, this cop, he's,

16:01.885 --> 16:04.012
he's got a family so...

16:04.012 --> 16:05.872
I'm a mute until  the facts are in.

16:05.872 --> 16:07.392
Alright, thanks.

16:18.860 --> 16:20.276
Mrs.Cofield.

16:21.227 --> 16:22.478
Lieutenant.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.200
I appreciate you taking the time.

16:26.887 --> 16:29.014
Laurie, we are gonna find 
out who did this to Dan.

16:29.014 --> 16:30.253
You have my word on it.

16:30.253 --> 16:31.917
I know you will.

16:32.831 --> 16:35.407
Dan loved his job very much.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.602
It's all he ever talked about.

16:37.602 --> 16:41.468
Well, he was a good man 
and a great officer.

16:41.986 --> 16:43.515
Everyone's been really nice,

16:43.515 --> 16:45.132
the other wives.

16:46.157 --> 16:47.307
But,

16:48.157 --> 16:50.464
I've already heard things,

16:50.464 --> 16:53.211
about an IAB investigation.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.988
Well, an investigation like that

16:56.988 --> 17:00.244
is normal for this type of situation.

17:02.153 --> 17:04.645
Dan didn't tell me everything.

17:05.309 --> 17:07.690
If he was into something,

17:08.700 --> 17:11.098
I'm worried about the kids.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.202
If we loose  Dan's  pension.

17:13.557 --> 17:14.742
Oh, I'm sorry, / Ok.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.990
I know it sounds horrible.

17:15.990 --> 17:18.015
This is not easy.

17:18.015 --> 17:19.204
Here's what I want you to do.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.114
I want you to leave everything to me now.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.270
Excuse me.

17:27.766 --> 17:29.120
What do ya got?

17:30.855 --> 17:33.266
CODIS-hit on the gum Gary Neilson.

17:33.266 --> 17:36.450
He's in the system for sexual 
assault back in 2000.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.180
- He lives in Belle harbour.
- Ok, perfect !

17:44.977 --> 17:46.639
It's a gimme right? / Sure

17:48.087 --> 17:49.370
Gary,

17:50.066 --> 17:52.014
you need to lock your  elbows.

17:53.329 --> 17:54.876
Looking for a forth?

17:55.082 --> 17:56.796
Actually, we're looking for you.

17:57.802 --> 17:58.713
What for?

17:58.713 --> 18:00.918
Information on a murdered cop.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.851
Dan Cofield.

18:03.354 --> 18:05.540
Oh, I saw that in the news.

18:05.540 --> 18:06.442
That's horrible.

18:06.442 --> 18:08.858
We found your DNA inside a piece 
of chewing gum

18:08.858 --> 18:11.567
inside officer Cofields car.

18:12.902 --> 18:14.322
I'm sorry, I was waiting for the punch line.

18:14.322 --> 18:17.126
This is  no joke, I can assure you.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.887
Now you'd better tell them 
to move on without you.

18:22.257 --> 18:25.707
I'll catch up with you at the club house
Alright!

18:29.263 --> 18:31.087
I wasn't in any police car.

18:31.087 --> 18:32.559
May be you weren't but your semen

18:32.559 --> 18:35.058
was inside your chewing gum.

18:38.424 --> 18:40.554
I was with a girl, alright?

18:40.554 --> 18:42.066
She has a piece of gum,

18:42.066 --> 18:43.260
you come and hassel me?

18:43.260 --> 18:45.747
Right  now, our problem is a dead officer.

18:45.747 --> 18:46.844
I don't know anything about that.

18:46.844 --> 18:48.624
But you do know the girl.

18:49.925 --> 18:52.476
I used her services  last night.

18:53.512 --> 18:54.749
Biggest mistake I ever made.

18:54.749 --> 18:55.741
What's her name?

18:55.741 --> 18:56.891
Like they give you the real one.

18:56.891 --> 18:58.485
Well, we'll take a fake on,

18:58.485 --> 19:00.782
and a location.

19:02.046 --> 19:03.793
Tiffany.

19:04.150 --> 19:06.655
137th. Overtown.

19:06.655 --> 19:08.842
See, that wasn't that hard

19:11.458 --> 19:12.911
Please, sit down.

19:14.877 --> 19:18.626
Tiffany, how well did you know officer Cofield.

19:18.626 --> 19:19.877
I didn't

19:19.877 --> 19:21.294
Cop's a cop.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.703
Officer Cofield's a little different.

19:24.703 --> 19:26.127
Oh my god.

19:28.001 --> 19:28.844
Now I remember him.

19:28.844 --> 19:30.375
Well you should, you were in his car

19:30.375 --> 19:33.057
last night right before he got murdered.

19:33.057 --> 19:34.243
No I wans't.

19:34.243 --> 19:36.022
Your  gum says you were.

19:36.899 --> 19:39.328
Cops have to clean out their 
cars after  every shift.

19:39.328 --> 19:41.731
Which leaves a very small window.

19:45.432 --> 19:46.840
He said  he  wouldn't  arrest me

19:46.840 --> 19:49.810
if, you know I took care of him.

19:52.755 --> 19:54.778
What exactly did he ask you to do?

19:54.778 --> 19:57.916
He had his thing just like any of them.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.405
He was nice though.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.453
Even paid me.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.006
You happen to have the 
money that he used?

20:13.684 --> 20:15.720
300 bucks.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.785
That's all of it.

20:16.785 --> 20:21.510
Wow, that's a lot of cash for an
honest cop to be  throwing around.

20:21.510 --> 20:23.477
Unless it  wasn't for sex.

20:33.409 --> 20:35.303
Car's in the driveway.

20:38.294 --> 20:42.133
Mr.Rutter we have a warrant to
search the premises.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.815
Let's go around the back.

21:01.772 --> 21:04.207
Oh.../ I've got him. Call it in.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.713
Bitch stabbed me and took off.

21:09.713 --> 21:11.908
An ambulance is on its way.

21:11.908 --> 21:12.852
What's her name?

21:12.852 --> 21:14.478
Anna Moralez.

21:14.737 --> 21:15.707
She got a job?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.298
She helps a friend  out.

21:17.298 --> 21:18.496
Do you know  her friend's name?

21:18.496 --> 21:19.597
Uh, Maria, Maria, something,

21:19.597 --> 21:21.646
they're always jabbering in Spanish.

21:21.646 --> 21:22.873
Woman named Maria in Miami!

21:22.873 --> 21:24.340
That narrows it down.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.564
Excuse me.

21:30.564 --> 21:31.649
Thank you.

21:31.649 --> 21:32.716
The man looks pretty cut and dried.

21:32.716 --> 21:33.748
Weapon on the ground,

21:33.748 --> 21:35.083
standard kitchen knife.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.478
Victim stabbed there,

21:36.478 --> 21:37.515
crawled from there to there,

21:37.515 --> 21:39.525
looks like he was going for the phone.

21:39.897 --> 21:41.437
Fresh paint.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.957
Excuse me?

21:42.957 --> 21:43.858
That's great.

21:43.858 --> 21:45.440
I appreciate your assessment.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.537
Unknown suspect fled in a hurry,

21:47.537 --> 21:48.654
possibly on foot.

21:48.654 --> 21:50.146
The suspect's not unknown.

21:50.146 --> 21:51.989
Her name is Anna Moralez,

21:51.989 --> 21:54.092
approximately 5'6, 110 pounds,

21:54.092 --> 21:55.637
black hair, brown eyes.

21:55.637 --> 21:56.505
First rule of thumb.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.318
Question a living victim if you've got one.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.139
They might be lying, 
but at least it's a start

22:00.139 --> 22:02.637
Second thing, 
put out a  broadcast below.

22:04.230 --> 22:05.764
Oh, and officer,

22:05.764 --> 22:07.270
I don't believe I got your name.

22:07.270 --> 22:09.199
Aaron Jessup. and....

22:09.199 --> 22:11.548
Calleigh Ducane. CSI.

22:11.548 --> 22:13.512
Welcome  to Miami-Dade PD.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.278
Yeah, soon as we can.

23:51.278 --> 23:52.386
Hey Rick,

23:52.990 --> 23:54.575
Rick, you got a minute?

23:54.575 --> 23:56.015
Yeah, excuse me?

23:56.015 --> 23:58.413
Since when do uniforms carry CI money?

23:58.413 --> 23:59.304
What are you talking about?

23:59.304 --> 24:00.995
Dan Cofield was running this girl

24:00.995 --> 24:03.155
as a confidential informant, wasn't he?

24:03.155 --> 24:04.469
I just found that out  this morning.

24:04.469 --> 24:06.006
When were you going to tell me?

24:06.006 --> 24:07.845
What was Dan into?

24:09.879 --> 24:12.502
Cofield logged out the cash to pay the girl.

24:12.502 --> 24:13.657
He photocopied the serial numbers...

24:13.657 --> 24:15.869
I know the money is legitimate.

24:15.869 --> 24:18.234
The money is, but he may not be.

24:21.945 --> 24:23.597
Here you go. / Thank you.

24:31.783 --> 24:33.464
What are you talking about?

24:33.464 --> 24:35.147
IAB investigations are confidential.

24:35.147 --> 24:36.192
Strictly need to know.

24:36.192 --> 24:39.738
If I figure out that you're withholding
information from me Rick.

24:39.738 --> 24:43.661
This is about me dating your 
brother's wife, isn't it?

24:46.251 --> 24:50.147
No, this is about your desire to 
destroy a man's reputation,

24:50.147 --> 24:51.838
that's what this is about.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.869
The verdict is still out 
on officer Cofield.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.212
Soon as I can clear his name, I will.

24:56.212 --> 24:57.181
I'm doing my job.

24:57.181 --> 25:00.073
And leaving a cop-killer on the street.

25:09.035 --> 25:10.913
Tiffany, you lied  to me, didn't you?

25:10.913 --> 25:13.244
Officer Cofield  said  don't trust anyone.

25:13.244 --> 25:14.385
Hmm.

25:14.385 --> 25:17.157
Well, you're  gonna have to 
trust me now, won't ya?

25:17.157 --> 25:18.440
I can't help you.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.169
That is not true.

25:21.369 --> 25:22.898
Of course, you can.

25:23.179 --> 25:27.176
I wanna know who officer Cofield  was after.

25:30.345 --> 25:32.211
Tiffany!

25:34.592 --> 25:36.892
Name's Jimmy Esario.

25:37.561 --> 25:40.195
Whenever I'd get a client in 
a nice car, I'd call Jimmy.

25:40.195 --> 25:42.802
And Jimmy would car-jack the 
misdealer car, right?

25:43.053 --> 25:45.425
Get out of the car. Get out the  car now!

25:45.987 --> 25:49.123
Jimmmy's not the kinda guy 
you ask a lot of questions.

25:49.123 --> 25:50.805
Paid me fifty bucks a call.

25:50.805 --> 25:54.820
Officer Cofield figured out  what you
and Jimmy were doing, didn't he?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.333
Didn't he?

25:56.333 --> 25:58.348
But he didn't make me stop.

25:58.571 --> 26:02.619
He told me next time I tipped Jimmy
on a client, to call him first.

26:02.619 --> 26:04.806
What was this client's name?

26:09.299 --> 26:11.272
Is this man the client?

26:14.480 --> 26:16.810
I never look at their faces.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.532
Tiffany! / Hi.

26:40.914 --> 26:44.843
Hey Jimmy, got a live one 
coming  your way baby.

26:46.382 --> 26:47.785
Nice.

26:48.103 --> 26:51.505
Huh, thank you. / Welcome.

26:51.505 --> 26:53.234
Take care of yourself.

26:55.302 --> 26:56.582
Last I saw officer Cofield,

26:56.582 --> 26:58.790
he went after Jimmy in the Benz.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.019
Now what?

27:02.019 --> 27:03.426
You call Jimmy,

27:03.913 --> 27:07.420
and you tell Jimmy that you 
have another car for him.

27:11.711 --> 27:13.932
Subject is approaching the vehicle.

27:14.819 --> 27:16.228
Ok. Easy.

27:16.228 --> 27:18.057
Wait for my signal.

27:20.163 --> 27:22.284
Go, go go!

27:26.411 --> 27:27.721
Don't move. Get up.

27:27.721 --> 27:29.302
Get your hands up.

27:30.836 --> 27:32.701
Jimmy. / Get your hands up.

27:35.046 --> 27:36.657
Watch it, easy.

27:39.636 --> 27:42.352
Whoa, that's a nasty burn 
you got on your ear.

27:42.352 --> 27:44.684
Did you get that shooting it out 
with a cop you killed Jimmy?

27:44.684 --> 27:47.442
When he tried to stop 
you from taking the Benz.

27:47.780 --> 27:49.319
Alright,  alright, hey.

27:50.501 --> 27:51.994
So we jacked the Benz,

27:51.994 --> 27:54.745
I didn't kill nobody. I swear.

27:54.745 --> 27:59.864
Jimmy, where is the car right now?

28:14.847 --> 28:16.766
Get down!!Get down

28:28.703 --> 28:32.165
Get down on the ground right now.

28:34.115 --> 28:35.816
That's the car, H.

28:35.816 --> 28:37.278
That's it.

28:41.942 --> 28:44.739
Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?

28:45.332 --> 28:48.000
I don't mean to bump on 
officer Cofield's case

28:48.000 --> 28:49.685
but the woman that this belongs to,

28:49.685 --> 28:50.935
her name is Anna Moralez,

28:50.935 --> 28:53.828
and I can't find her on 
public record anywhere.

28:53.828 --> 28:56.849
So you think that apron's gonna 
tell you where she's been.

28:56.849 --> 28:58.446
Or where she's going to be.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.808
I found corn husks and 
parchment paper in  her house.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.265
I think she makes tomalleys for

29:03.265 --> 29:06.695
a mobile food truck 
company called Sonrisa.

29:06.695 --> 29:08.423
Why don't you just pick her up?

29:08.423 --> 29:10.799
Well, because there's about thirty trucks

29:10.799 --> 29:12.873
scattered throughout the county.

29:12.873 --> 29:16.026
Besides, when I asked them, 
they said they never heard of her.

29:16.494 --> 29:20.015
They probably don't have the 
most legit employment records.

29:20.015 --> 29:22.049
I found a piece  of paper in her pocket

29:22.049 --> 29:24.452
and written on it were the numbers

29:24.452 --> 29:27.690
8, 17 and 24.

29:27.690 --> 29:28.973
I'm thinking they're bus routes.

29:28.973 --> 29:31.797
Well, that narrows it down to South Miami.

29:31.797 --> 29:34.585
I'm hoping to narrow it  down further.

30:15.636 --> 30:17.530
It's the same thing on every slide.

30:17.530 --> 30:20.118
There's one substance that 
covered the entire apron.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.918
Salt? /  Well, it's not table salt.

30:22.918 --> 30:25.544
It's unprocessed. / Sea salt?

30:25.852 --> 30:27.299
She didn't get it from cooking.

30:27.299 --> 30:29.492
No, but she did get it on the job.

30:29.492 --> 30:30.505
Where are you going?

30:30.505 --> 30:32.652
To grab an early dinner. Thank you.

30:33.086 --> 30:34.385
Thank you.

30:47.270 --> 30:48.990
Buenas Tardes

30:51.771 --> 30:52.936
May I help you?

30:52.936 --> 30:53.830
Yes you can.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.487
Is your name Maria?

30:56.776 --> 30:59.505
I am here  to see your friend Anna Morales

31:02.764 --> 31:06.536
Juana, la seniora.....

31:11.075 --> 31:13.923
You are here to arrest me, aren't you?

31:13.923 --> 31:15.931
You speak English?

31:17.647 --> 31:20.526
If, if he knew I was learning,

31:22.784 --> 31:25.616
Is he... / Alive, yes.

31:25.616 --> 31:27.415
He's gonna be fine.

31:29.044 --> 31:30.971
I tried to leave.

31:30.971 --> 31:33.116
Many times/you don't have to explain.

31:33.116 --> 31:36.918
wh.. when I came here I had nothing.

31:36.918 --> 31:40.284
But he had a home.

31:42.849 --> 31:46.116
Anna, are you injured anywhere else?

31:51.496 --> 31:56.081
No marks but I hurt here. / May I?

32:00.556 --> 32:02.098
What did he do to you?

32:04.044 --> 32:05.512
It's okay.

32:06.485 --> 32:08.667
Will you come with me to the hospital?

32:08.667 --> 32:13.430
I don't have papers.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.110
Anna, even if you aren't documented,

32:15.110 --> 32:17.841
you are human being and have rights.

32:19.322 --> 32:20.991
And I'll go with you.

32:24.939 --> 32:27.064
Gary, we found your car.

32:28.204 --> 32:29.714
That's great.

32:29.904 --> 32:32.222
You work fast. / Yes, we do.

32:32.222 --> 32:36.731
The gentlemen who stole it 
admitted to car jacking you.

32:36.731 --> 32:38.134
Car jacking?

32:38.134 --> 32:40.538
That car was stolen from 
my parking garage.

32:40.538 --> 32:43.036
I filed a police report this morning.

32:47.046 --> 32:50.244
You were there when the cop 
was murdered, weren't you?

32:51.575 --> 32:52.914
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:52.914 --> 32:54.684
If you don't come forward Gary,

32:54.684 --> 32:58.822
his killers go free.
Is that what you want?

32:58.822 --> 33:00.975
I wasn't there.

33:02.151 --> 33:03.731
Yes you were.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.061
And I'm gonna prove it.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.997
Miss Ducane. / Calleigh.

33:15.997 --> 33:18.338
My TO says you requested to see me.

33:18.338 --> 33:20.816
I thought you might wanna 
see this one through.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.403
I found Anna.

33:27.403 --> 33:29.883
She's getting medical help.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.071
Fred Rutter's has been beating her.

33:32.430 --> 33:33.526
How?

33:34.325 --> 33:36.447
That's up to us to find out.

33:41.583 --> 33:45.590
Okay, just remember theories are great.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.876
But it all comes back to the evidence.

33:47.876 --> 33:50.374
Is that a tooth? / Mm-hmm

33:54.506 --> 33:57.116
And anything can mean something.

34:03.019 --> 34:04.885
What do you notice?

34:06.677 --> 34:09.831
Laundary bag, soap.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.030
Look over there. Sash cord.

34:13.641 --> 34:16.210
Great. Put it in context.

34:16.774 --> 34:19.980
Simple house hold items 
turned into a weapon.

34:20.784 --> 34:22.678
Tell the cop anything?

34:22.678 --> 34:24.455
you're lying, you're lying,

34:25.716 --> 34:26.924
you're lying,

34:28.467 --> 34:30.362
I know you're lying.

34:34.790 --> 34:35.884
Come here.

34:37.107 --> 34:38.667
He unwrapped each individual soap bar

34:38.667 --> 34:40.429
and tied the bag off with the sash cord.

34:40.429 --> 34:41.920
Shows premeditation.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.695
Used a deadly weapon.

34:43.695 --> 34:46.054
Makes the  charge aggravated battery,

34:46.054 --> 34:47.809
up and into a second degree felony

34:47.809 --> 34:50.251
You just tied in years into a sentence

34:50.251 --> 34:51.868
Great job, man.

34:56.513 --> 34:58.737
Mr. Rutter / Hey.

35:00.296 --> 35:01.931
I hope you got her.

35:01.931 --> 35:04.382
- Lucky I didn't die.
- Yeah I found Anna.

35:04.382 --> 35:05.968
I also found out evidence in your home

35:05.968 --> 35:08.284
that proves you've been beating her.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.166
What are you talking about?

35:10.795 --> 35:13.738
Oh, uh, oh.. You mean her lip.

35:14.186 --> 35:16.207
Come on, give me a break.
She's... she's clumsy.

35:16.207 --> 35:18.043
I know that you beat her 
with a weigthed bag

35:18.043 --> 35:20.873
and I guess that you thought 
you were being smart.

35:20.873 --> 35:23.484
If you don't see it, it doesn't exist.

35:23.484 --> 35:25.964
But what you don't know is 
that she's bleeding  internally.

35:25.964 --> 35:28.265
She has abdominal trauma.

35:28.265 --> 35:29.869
See, the thing about bruises,

35:29.869 --> 35:33.250
the normal bruises occur when
vessels break underneath the skin.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.748
But hers are in the muscles.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.167
you're lying, you're lying

35:40.722 --> 35:43.873
It's gonna take a day or two
for them to rise to the surface.

35:43.873 --> 35:46.534
And they'll darken and 
we'll photograph them.

35:46.534 --> 35:49.170
And juries love photographs.

35:51.426 --> 35:54.153
She will never testify against me.

35:54.758 --> 35:57.945
She may, or she may not.
But it's beside the point.

35:57.945 --> 35:59.779
The evidences will speak for her.

35:59.779 --> 36:02.167
She stabbed me.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.316
The interesting thing 
about these two crimes

36:04.316 --> 36:07.513
is that I've got enough on 
you for aggravated battery.

36:07.513 --> 36:11.248
But for her, just self-defense.

36:11.617 --> 36:12.892
Cuff him.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.066
Are you out of your mind?

36:15.066 --> 36:16.801
She's not even American.

36:16.801 --> 36:18.188
What kind of system is this?

36:18.188 --> 36:20.260
I guess you're about to find out.

37:22.742 --> 37:25.191
Pulled a .22 out of Gary's car.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.250
No match on IBIS.
Gun's not in the system.

37:28.250 --> 37:31.783
The .22 is registerd to Gary Neilson's wife.

37:31.783 --> 37:35.741
Smart. An ex-con like Gary 
knows he can't own a gun

37:36.589 --> 37:38.174
Why would he shoot inside his own car?

37:38.174 --> 37:40.961
Maybe he wasn't alone in the car.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.701
Close quarters,
those burns on Jimmy's ear.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.710
How do we prove Gary pulled the trigger?

37:49.710 --> 37:51.447
The old-fashioned way.

37:51.447 --> 37:52.696
I already told you.

37:52.696 --> 37:55.702
My car was take from my garage.

37:56.027 --> 38:00.009
Yes, according to your parking card Gary,

38:00.009 --> 38:02.106
you didn't make it home last night.

38:02.106 --> 38:04.783
Okay, so I must 've parked on the street.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.318
Need I remind you that 
filing a false police report

38:07.318 --> 38:10.105
is punishable by jail time.

38:10.105 --> 38:11.939
So you wanna try again?

38:16.217 --> 38:18.906
All right. Uh...

38:22.466 --> 38:24.663
After I dropped off the girl,

38:25.019 --> 38:28.992
I was on my way home and
these two guys came out nowhere.

38:35.215 --> 38:36.329
Get out  the car!!

38:36.329 --> 38:38.889
Get out of the car!! Now!! Go!

38:42.184 --> 38:45.297
But that's all that happened.
I didn't see any shooting.

38:47.551 --> 38:48.903
Okay.

38:49.635 --> 38:52.472
I bet you didn't hear any either, did you?

38:53.426 --> 38:54.915
What's that?

38:55.841 --> 39:00.015
Gary I'm gonna ask you to take a test, okay?

39:18.759 --> 39:20.221
So what've we got?

39:20.221 --> 39:23.615
Pure tone test indicates significant injuries 
to his ear drums.

39:23.615 --> 39:25.059
Lucky for him it's only temporary.

39:25.059 --> 39:26.797
Okay. But he does have hearing loss.

39:26.797 --> 39:28.584
Mm-hm.  Short term.

39:28.584 --> 39:32.594
Probably caused by exposure to 
something in the 140 decibel range.

39:32.594 --> 39:37.299
- That's a jet engine.
- Jet engine or a gun shot.

39:38.148 --> 39:39.832
Right, Gary?

39:41.695 --> 39:43.346
Give me a minute, will ya?

39:50.088 --> 39:51.751
So I don't hear so well.

39:51.751 --> 39:53.544
And this test Gary,

39:53.544 --> 39:55.943
confirms that you got the officer killed.

39:55.943 --> 39:57.033
That's ridiculous.

39:57.033 --> 40:00.165
You weren't in that car alone, were you?

40:04.837 --> 40:06.674
Get out  the car!!

40:12.481 --> 40:13.383
Miami dade police.

40:13.383 --> 40:15.975
Put your hands where I can see them, now!

40:15.975 --> 40:17.486
Officer Cofield,

40:17.486 --> 40:19.781
had the situation under control.

40:19.781 --> 40:22.668
And then you went and got stupid

40:49.143 --> 40:51.326
I only fired one shot.

40:51.326 --> 40:52.800
I was trying to defend myself.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.819
It's called contagious gun fire.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.583
And if you hadn't started shooting,

40:56.583 --> 40:58.333
none of this would have happened.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.544
- I didn't do anything.
- It's exactly right.

41:00.544 --> 41:02.833
When you should have used 
a radio to call for a help.

41:02.833 --> 41:04.650
But you didn't do it.

41:12.747 --> 41:14.123
Hey

41:14.123 --> 41:15.896
I don't have to report a crime.

41:16.571 --> 41:17.867
There's no law against that.

41:17.867 --> 41:19.104
It's true.

41:19.104 --> 41:22.286
But now you're gonna have to live with it.

41:31.611 --> 41:33.327
Look.

41:33.327 --> 41:36.319
I will testify about the car-jacking

41:36.319 --> 41:39.751
and the shooting, 
just not about the girl.

41:40.747 --> 41:43.314
You've just commited a felony 
by concealing a weapon.

41:43.314 --> 41:47.481
The girl is the least of your problems.

41:58.181 --> 41:59.649
Hi, dad.

42:00.390 --> 42:01.979
Yeah, I know.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.076
No, I'm fine.

42:05.771 --> 42:07.502
Hey dad, listen.

42:07.502 --> 42:10.108
I have a great case for you.

42:10.553 --> 42:12.151
Her name's Anna

42:14.390 --> 42:16.365
Hey / Hey

42:16.365 --> 42:18.203
What are you doing her?

42:20.196 --> 42:21.727
Hello / Hey

42:22.088 --> 42:23.249
Horatio.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.812
Heard you caught Dan Cofield's killer.

42:24.812 --> 42:26.517
- Yeah, that's right.
- Congratulations,

42:26.517 --> 42:27.849
I'm sure we'll end up clearing him.

42:27.849 --> 42:30.809
If his family doesn't get full benefits, 
you are gonna hear from me.

42:30.809 --> 42:31.873
Don't hate me, hate the job.

42:31.873 --> 42:33.517
I'll take that into consideration

42:33.517 --> 42:34.481
No hard feelings, right?

42:34.481 --> 42:36.537
No, absolutely not.

42:36.537 --> 42:37.881
Okay, I'm gonna lock up my office,

42:37.881 --> 42:40.140
and I'll see you downstairs. / Okay.

42:40.986 --> 42:42.225
You take care.

42:42.225 --> 42:44.709
Yeah. You, too.

42:48.238 --> 42:49.565
I'm sure that Dan Cofield's widow

42:49.565 --> 42:52.345
will appreciate everything you've done.

42:52.345 --> 42:55.368
Well, I just let the evidence clear his name.

42:55.970 --> 42:59.972
Still, she's lucky to have you.

42:59.972 --> 43:01.601
Thank you.

43:04.119 --> 43:05.946
See you tomorrow.
