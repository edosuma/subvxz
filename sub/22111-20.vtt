WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:05.222
HIDOKO: We found somebody--
George Nelson.

00:05.266 --> 00:06.441
Former NIS agent in Vietnam.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.921
Most of the guys
I served with are gone.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.314
I'm not sure how long I got.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.576
HETTY:
Harris Keane.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.665
You don't remember
the helicopter crash?

00:13.709 --> 00:14.710
You left me to die.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.059
I thought you were dead.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.061
I would have been
better off.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.846
There's always someone
worth killing, and I did,

00:20.890 --> 00:22.196
a hundred times over.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.936
Then one day
I put my rifle down.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.504
I don't even know what
home is anymore.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.897
It's with us now.

00:41.302 --> 00:44.087
You do know we have
a gas stove, right?

00:44.131 --> 00:45.871
It's called "glamping"
for a reason.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.569
Cooking s'mores on a stove
is blasphemy.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.007
Lend a hand?We had to march
ten miles

00:51.051 --> 00:52.617
just to get here,
and now you want me

00:52.661 --> 00:53.966
to do physical labor?

00:54.010 --> 00:56.056
First of all,
that was two miles, tops.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.101
Second of all, this
hardly counts as labor.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.235
And, quoth my dad,
it does build character.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.975
So come on,
put your phone down and help.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.021
All right, just hold on.
I got no service,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.415
and I can't get this
stupid Wi-Fi to work.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.633
Wasn't the whole point
of coming out here

01:08.677 --> 01:11.854
to escape technology?I know, but-- Whoa!

01:11.897 --> 01:12.855
What is that?

01:12.898 --> 01:14.422
WOMAN:
Relax.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.467
It's a rocket launch
from Vandenberg.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.775
I saw a story about it
on the news last night.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.994
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:22.038 --> 01:25.215
Oh, I gotta record this.
The 'Gram is gonna love it.

01:27.739 --> 01:31.265
That can't...
be normal, right? Uh,

01:31.308 --> 01:32.744
is that coming
towards us?
Yeah.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.659
It is. Run!

01:34.703 --> 01:37.009
Run!
Go! Go!

01:37.053 --> 01:37.967
Go!

01:42.580 --> 01:45.496
â™ª

02:02.818 --> 02:04.863
I'm not saying it's stupid,
I'm just saying it's boring.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.169
It's not boring,
it's soothing.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
It's a waste of time,
Deeks.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.955
Whoa. That's like saying that
therapy is a waste of time,

02:09.999 --> 02:12.436
because after a long day
of things blowing up,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.656
and getting shot at
and arresting bad guys,

02:14.699 --> 02:17.137
I just like to go home
and relax and watch

02:17.180 --> 02:18.921
some Slow TV.Oh, my God.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.315
Yesterday, you watched
eight full hours of a boat

02:21.358 --> 02:23.534
crossing a fjord,
and nothing was happening.

02:23.578 --> 02:24.970
The boat wasn't on fire,

02:25.014 --> 02:26.972
there were no pirates
trying to board the boat.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.104
There wasn't even
any music.
I know.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.410
That's part of
the slow movement.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.325
It's about finding
a better pace for life.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.587
I like our pace.
What's wrong with our pace?

02:32.630 --> 02:34.110
Just saying that things
are moving so fast

02:34.154 --> 02:36.330
where, like, a single tweet
could start a nuclear war,

02:36.373 --> 02:38.114
that we could all
benefit by just

02:38.158 --> 02:39.376
slowing down a little bit.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.986
Guys! There you are.Oh, my God.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.032
We gotta go. We got a case.
It's a thing--

02:43.075 --> 02:43.989
Well, it's more than a case.
It's so cool.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.339
Just, you guys
gotta come.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.949
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

02:46.992 --> 02:49.212
Come on, come on, come on!

02:50.605 --> 02:51.606
Was he foaming
at the mouth?

02:51.649 --> 02:52.998
I'm having heart palpitations

02:53.042 --> 02:54.739
just from watching that.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.873
Here we go.
Last night,

02:57.916 --> 03:00.267
Proxima Aerospace launched
a Janus III rocket

03:00.310 --> 03:02.182
from the Vandenberg
Air Force Base.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.054
91 seconds into flight,
this happened.

03:06.664 --> 03:09.232
Great.
Another episode

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
of Slow TV.It's very relaxing.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.670
Hmm?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.411
Oh, uh, jumped the gun
a little bit.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.108
91 seconds into flight,

03:16.152 --> 03:18.241
this happened.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.288
Oh! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.028
Wait, there was no one
on board, right?
Correct.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.074
It was unmanned,
but it was carrying

03:25.117 --> 03:26.293
a top-secret payload

03:26.336 --> 03:27.772
from the National
Reconnaissance Office.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.513
The NRO designs,
builds

03:29.557 --> 03:31.472
and operates the government
spy satellites.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.213
That payload should be
orbiting the Earth right now,

03:33.256 --> 03:34.649
but instead, it crashed

03:34.692 --> 03:36.738
somewhere deep in the
Los Padres National Forest.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.218
Campers and hikers
have been reporting

03:38.261 --> 03:39.219
debris sightings
all morning,

03:39.262 --> 03:40.437
but, unfortunately,

03:40.481 --> 03:42.004
nothing significant
has been recovered.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.397
The defense department
has launched

03:43.440 --> 03:45.573
a massive search effort--
it's all hands on deck.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.270
Which also includes us.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.055
I just sent agents
Callen, Hanna and Jones

03:50.099 --> 03:52.101
to the operations base
in Los Padres.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.581
They should be
arriving shortly.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.278
KENSI: What about
me and Deeks?And me, Eric Beale.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.324
'Cause I'm going, too.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.935
And Hidoko.DEEKS: I'm terrified.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.066
Where are we going?

04:01.110 --> 04:02.242
The four of you will be
investigating

04:02.285 --> 04:03.243
the failure of the rocket.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.462
By going to Proxima Aerospace.

04:05.506 --> 04:09.249
Home of the next
generation of space flight.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.251
Eric.
Yes?

04:11.294 --> 04:14.036
I just got off the phone
with the NRO director.Uh-huh.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.429
Proxima will be
coming to us.

04:15.472 --> 04:18.388
Well, with all due respect,
Assistant Director,

04:18.432 --> 04:20.477
I'm gonna be of much
more use on site.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.044
KENSI: I hate to say it,
but I do agree.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.088
If something went wrong
with the rocket,

04:23.132 --> 04:24.612
the evidence is probably
at Proxima.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.832
This wasn't an accident.
It was sabotage.

04:27.876 --> 04:31.445
Sabotage? We-Well, then the
saboteur will be at Proxima.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.360
Let's go. Come on!Eric.

04:33.403 --> 04:36.319
The NRO already has a suspect
they'd like us to question.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.452
They're headed over
to the boatshed now.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.541
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.282
When am I going to Proxima?

04:45.110 --> 04:47.330
Can you two handle this?

04:47.374 --> 04:48.549
KENSI: Yeah, we got it.
Yeah, of course.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.985
DEEKS:
All right, little buddy,

04:50.028 --> 04:51.595
we're gonna get you
through this.What?

04:51.639 --> 04:53.075
I got a video for you to watch
on the way over.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
A video?Yeah. It's about
a boat.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.600
Oh...ERIC: But rockets...

04:56.644 --> 05:00.125
He is a genius,
but boy,

05:00.169 --> 05:01.344
is he high-maintenance.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.346
Yeah.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.144
Whatever this payload is,
it must be important.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.364
It's like they're
preparing for battle.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.802
SAM: 3,000 square miles
of wilderness.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.196
Mother Nature's a force
to be reckoned with.Mm.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.807
So is the callof nature.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.723
Hi, I really need
that restroom.

05:32.767 --> 05:33.985
Again, I'm sorry
I missed the rest stop.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.813
Well, you were driving,

05:35.857 --> 05:37.511
and that makes you
the dad of the road trip.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.991
And it's the dad's
responsibility to let

05:40.035 --> 05:40.992
everyone know when

05:41.036 --> 05:42.385
the rest stop's coming up.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.734
She's not wrong.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.170
I don't know
the rules. Okay?

05:45.214 --> 05:46.520
I didn't do a lot of road
trips when I was a kid.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.740
You, by the way,
are an actual dad.

05:49.784 --> 05:50.915
Why didn't you
say something, huh?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.743
Oh, that's right,
you slept the whole way.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.311
Yeah, well, I was an actual
dad until 2:00 a.m.,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.444
helping Kam study
for her finals exam.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.098
I deserve a couple
hours of shut-eye.Ah, finally.

06:00.142 --> 06:03.928
Which one of you is
the lion tamer

06:03.972 --> 06:06.453
Because... this is a circus?

06:08.237 --> 06:10.979
Sorry. Haven't slept in 36
hours-- I get a little loopy.

06:11.022 --> 06:14.112
Melissa Gates, NRO mission
director's chief of staff.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.853
Agent Callen,
this is Agent Jones,

06:15.897 --> 06:16.985
Agent Hanna.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.074
NCIS Office of Special Projects.Perfect.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.337
This is a very special project.
If you'll follow me,

06:21.381 --> 06:23.165
I'll show you our
little big top.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.690
Okay, we'll get you guys
set up down here

06:26.734 --> 06:27.952
in the command post,

06:27.996 --> 06:29.258
and then we'll get you
out in the field.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.086
Hey, hey, hey, my area.
Get away from that.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.175
Any progress
on the search so far?

06:33.218 --> 06:35.395
We've recovered a number
of pieces of the rocket,

06:35.438 --> 06:36.657
but still haven't located
the payload.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.746
Funny thing about
these satellites,

06:38.789 --> 06:40.443
their transponders
don't actually activate

06:40.487 --> 06:41.792
until they reach space.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.881
Let's just say this one
fell a bit short.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.318
Emphasis on "fell."

06:46.362 --> 06:47.755
So, it-it is a satellite.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.409
I shouldn't have said that.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.454
No, you shouldn't have.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.325
I'm so sorry, sir.
Uh, Colonel Lawson is

06:53.369 --> 06:55.458
the NRO mission director
for the launch.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
Colonel Lawson,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.635
Agents Callen,
Hanna and Jones.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.376
NCIS.We need you geared up

07:00.420 --> 07:01.421
and in the field ASAP.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.466
The longer this
payload is missing,

07:03.510 --> 07:05.250
the more likely it is
to be damaged or destroyed.

07:05.294 --> 07:06.774
SAM: Well, it would
help us to know

07:06.817 --> 07:09.646
a little bit more about
what it is we're looking for.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.129
Let me be clear, Agent.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.870
I am not here to help you.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.698
You're here to help me.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.874
And if I point
in a direction, you go there.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.092
Understood?

07:21.136 --> 07:22.311
Yes, sir.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.968
Gates, with me.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.233
Well, I'm sure on days
when his rocket doesn't blow up

07:31.276 --> 07:34.454
he's a really nice guy.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.425
Keane?

08:33.469 --> 08:34.470
Keane...

08:49.398 --> 08:51.531
We need to talk.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.507
All right,
you guys all set?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.726
Water, sunscreen, MREs?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.466
We're good.
Where's the helo dropping us?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.381
Glad you asked.
So, your landing zone

09:16.425 --> 09:17.774
will be 20 klicks from here,

09:17.818 --> 09:20.516
and I will be monitoring you
the entire time.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.735
CALLEN:
Oh, that's reassuring.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.607
That's fun. Yeah,
this command post was

09:24.651 --> 09:25.739
put up in a hurry.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.001
Probably just working
some kinks out.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.656
Luckily, we've got
ye olde analog alternative.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.834
Sweet. Okay,
so the white pins

09:33.877 --> 09:36.837
and red circles indicate
areas where we believe

09:36.880 --> 09:38.055
debris has fallen.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.883
Now, that's based on
visual sightings

09:39.927 --> 09:41.058
and ballistic arcs.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.191
The remaining
pins indicate

09:43.234 --> 09:46.368
locations of search parties
currently in the field.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.762
You guys will be dropped
right about here,

09:48.805 --> 09:52.069
and then you will
work clockwise and out.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.723
Walking around
in circles.

09:53.767 --> 09:54.855
That sounds like fun.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.334
LAWSON:
I don't want to hear excuses.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.815
Get them on the radio
or get out of my command post.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.860
SAM:
Gates.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.343
SAM:
What's going on?

10:05.387 --> 10:07.476
We lost contact with a search
party half an hour ago.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.695
Which party?

10:08.738 --> 10:11.262
Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.787
Three-man party
led by Agent Murphy.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.745
Don't worry, it's probably
just technical difficulties.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.660
Gates.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.748
Ah, the ringmaster needs me.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.489
Your chopper leaves
in five.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.883
Happy hunting.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.754
Every member of that team
has their own radio.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.103
I find it very hard to believe

10:26.147 --> 10:28.105
that they all went out
at the exact same time.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.499
And they have sat phones,
like us.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.109
CALLEN: That's not far
from where we're going.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.763
You thinking
what I'm thinking?People over payload.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.330
Let's take a little detour.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.115
Colonel Grumpy Pants
is not gonna like that.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.901
All the more reason.
Mm-hmm.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.381
Chelsea Parker.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.818
There's been a mistake.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.864
So you didn't program an
unauthorized increase in thrust,

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
causing an
explosion and crash?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.520
No, that's insane.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.175
We're just saying, 'cause it
was done from your station.

10:54.218 --> 10:58.179
I worked for years
on this launch.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.225
Nights, weekends.
I sacrificed relationships.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.663
Why would I sabotage it
after all that?

11:03.706 --> 11:06.840
Well, Chelsea, that's what
we're here to find out.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.930
This is everything
we know about you,

11:09.973 --> 11:11.583
and we are going
to go through it...

11:11.627 --> 11:12.933
I just can't
believe this.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.804
How long has she worked for you?

11:14.848 --> 11:16.240
Five years.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.853
Model employee,
or so I thought.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.072
I mean, when I checked the
programming after the explosion

11:22.116 --> 11:24.814
and saw what she had done,
I thought I was going crazy.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.251
All right, launch sequence,
main engine burn,

11:27.295 --> 11:29.036
no surprises there.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.254
Though, in retrospect,

11:30.298 --> 11:32.039
I should've seen
the warning signs.

11:32.082 --> 11:35.085
This is where she
programmed the increase--

11:35.129 --> 11:36.347
Wait a second.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.741
I mean, she follows
Edward Snowden on Twitter.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.525
Why did she...

11:40.569 --> 11:42.049
She goes to all
of those marches,

11:42.092 --> 11:43.833
you know, for women
and minorities.

11:43.877 --> 11:46.706
Who I support, absolutely,

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
but there's a radical element.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.144
Nope.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.928
Eric, where
are you...

11:56.846 --> 11:58.979
Show me how you'd program
a stage separation sequence.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.810
You heard the man.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.995
What's he doing?

12:15.038 --> 12:17.040
That is a very good question.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.005
And?

12:26.528 --> 12:29.052
She's free to go.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.533
Uh... hold on,
hold on a second.You're free to go.

12:31.576 --> 12:32.882
Yeah, you don't actually
get to say that.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.754
Well, she didn't
sabotage the rocket.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.060
What?In computer programming,

12:37.104 --> 12:39.889
there are two methods
of code indentation,

12:39.933 --> 12:41.761
using spaces and using tabs.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.371
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.895
The code used to sabotage the
rocket was written with tabs.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.941
All of Chelsea's code,
including this one,

12:47.984 --> 12:49.769
used spaces.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.336
That's not...

12:52.380 --> 12:55.426
I-- She might've just done that
to throw us off the trail.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.821
Okay, but then why would she
program it from her own station?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.867
That seems
counterintuitive.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.739
ERIC:
Bingo. Clearly, it wasn't her.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.219
I always use spaces.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.438
It's not as efficient,
but it's more accurate, right?

13:07.482 --> 13:09.049
Totally.
Honestly,

13:09.092 --> 13:10.920
tabs drive me insane.Oh, my God.
Up the wall.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.052
They're the worst.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.705
Whenever Donald
asks me to fix his code,

13:13.749 --> 13:15.316
I want to pull
my hair out.Oh, my God. Drive me bananas.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.971
Hold on a second.
Donald, as in Donald Jenkins,

13:18.014 --> 13:20.712
your boss who's just outside

13:20.756 --> 13:22.453
CHELSEA:
Yeah.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.672
And he has access
to your station?

13:23.715 --> 13:26.196
He's my boss.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.593
Ah!Hidoko!

13:31.636 --> 13:34.204
He took a swing at me.
It was pathetic.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.858
So pathetic.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.120
Ugh!
Okay.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.166
All right.
Tabs.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.913
Sorry about the mess.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.523
You were good
enough to put me up.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.047
Oh, I don't care
about the mess, Keane.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.528
You were avoiding my calls.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.965
The psychologist
I recommended

13:56.009 --> 13:58.794
says you never showed up
to the appointment.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.797
I was worried.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.627
And I think I was right to be.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.021
It's this...

14:08.064 --> 14:09.892
It's, uh... this dry climate.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.503
I'm-I'm not used to it.
I keep getting nosebleeds.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.505
Hetty, if I wanted
to kill myself,

14:14.549 --> 14:17.160
I would have done it long ago.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.206
Hell, I've had
plenty of chances.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.210
What is all this?

14:23.253 --> 14:26.082
It looks like letters,
but I don't see

14:26.126 --> 14:28.650
any envelopes.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.872
Keane?

14:34.264 --> 14:36.614
That's because the Post Office

14:36.658 --> 14:39.269
doesn't deliver
where they're gonna go.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.316
It's...

14:42.359 --> 14:43.578
Uh...

14:53.501 --> 14:57.287
Captain Thien Lu,
83rd Viet Cong Sapper Battalion.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.637
He wiped out an entire
village for talking

14:59.681 --> 15:03.076
to the Americans.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.775
After the war,
he settled down on a farm.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.038
That's where I found him.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.215
And that's where I took him out.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.217
While his wife
and three daughters

15:14.261 --> 15:16.045
slept in-in the other room.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.800
Madame Song.

15:31.843 --> 15:36.239
Sh-She delivered young girls
to the Khmer Rouge.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.937
And

15:37.980 --> 15:41.244
One night, I-I followed
her home and...
Stop.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.117
I don't need to hear this.

15:44.160 --> 15:48.121
You can't keep doing
this to yourself.

15:48.164 --> 15:51.124
This is not atonement.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.169
This is punishment.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.002
My sins are all
I have left, Hetty.

16:05.399 --> 16:08.228
Keane.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.881
There's a suit
in there.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.667
Put it on.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.103
You're coming with me.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.368
Okay.

16:24.418 --> 16:28.988
Mountains, forest,
oceans, desert,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.990
all within an hour's
drive of L.A.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.123
Sometimes I forget
how lucky we are.

16:34.167 --> 16:37.126
Not sure everyone
would agree with you.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.911
Earthquakes,
forest fires, mudslides.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.175
Sometimes it feels like we're
playing disaster roulette.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.828
Disaster roulette.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.134
There's danger everywhere.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.962
At least we get a little
beauty with our beast.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.225
NELL :
Callen, Sam, you copy?

16:49.269 --> 16:50.357
CALLEN:
Go ahead, Nell.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.098
All right, I am tracking
your progress,

16:52.141 --> 16:54.143
and you are in fact approaching

16:54.187 --> 16:55.492
the missing search party's
last known coordinates.

16:55.536 --> 16:58.278
Thanks.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.931
Agent Murphy!

16:59.975 --> 17:01.890
NCIS! We're here
to help!

17:01.933 --> 17:04.501
Agent Murphy.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.639
Sam.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.522
G.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.321
That's an entire
search party.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.327
We're not the only ones
looking for that payload.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.502
Yeah, whatever that
satellite does,

17:48.545 --> 17:52.462
someone's willing
to kill for it.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.869
I-I swear, I didn't mean
to assault that agent.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.915
Calling whatever
that was "assault"

18:10.959 --> 18:13.004
seems to be giving you
too much credit.

18:13.048 --> 18:13.918
Would you call
yourself a

18:13.962 --> 18:16.834
betting man, Donald?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.575
Uh...It's okay, we know
about the gambling.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.011
And the debt
that you're in.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.970
$75,000, to be exact.

18:22.013 --> 18:25.278
Well, being a bad gambler's
not a crime.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.802
No, just motive
to sabotage a rocket,

18:27.845 --> 18:29.630
but, you know what,
accessory to murder,

18:29.673 --> 18:31.588
that actually is a crime.I'm sorry.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.763
Murder?One of the search parties

18:32.807 --> 18:33.764
looking for the payload

18:33.808 --> 18:34.896
from the rocket you blew up,

18:34.939 --> 18:36.115
they were taken out.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.508
As in shot dead. That is
three Special Agents

18:38.552 --> 18:39.814
who are not coming home
to their families.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.032
You did that.

18:41.076 --> 18:44.035
They're dead
because of you.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.950
I...

18:48.605 --> 18:51.217
Ah, it wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.957
So why don't
you tell us

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
how it was supposed to happen?

18:57.745 --> 18:59.442
I was approached by a loan shark

18:59.486 --> 19:01.140
that I owed.
Name.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.881
Franco Martinez.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.970
Only, he-he-he wasn't

19:06.014 --> 19:08.973
coming to collect, he was
offering to pay off my debt,

19:09.017 --> 19:10.323
half up front
and half afterwards,

19:10.366 --> 19:11.889
plus a bonus if I just did

19:11.933 --> 19:13.152
this little
thing for him.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.892
This little thing being
sabotaging a rocket

19:14.936 --> 19:17.025
carrying a top secret
government payload.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.548
Not so much a
little thing.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.376
If I had known people
were gonna get killed,

19:20.420 --> 19:21.508
I never would've agreed.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.336
Mm-hmm.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.513
Ugh, stupid Donald.

19:26.556 --> 19:30.299
Oh, so stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid,

19:30.343 --> 19:32.867
stupid, stupid, stupid.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.695
Stop hitting yourself
in the head.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.913
Stupid, stupid

19:35.957 --> 19:36.914
Donald.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.003
Yeah, I'll go get him.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.923
Franco Martinez.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.796
Small time loan shark,
known to operate in Koreatown.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.929
But somebody is putting
a lot of money into this.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.366
Franco's probably
the middleman.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.802
Agreed. We need to figure out

19:54.845 --> 19:56.107
whoever's bankrolling
this operation.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.109
Have Donald contact Franco

19:58.153 --> 19:59.589
and arrange a meet.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.765
Sorry, so you
want us to put

20:01.809 --> 20:05.508
that guy in the field?

20:05.552 --> 20:08.119
Unfortunately, I don't think
we have much of a choice.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.556
Walk him through it, coach him.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.384
I don't have to have
faith in the student,

20:11.427 --> 20:12.602
just the teachers.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.130
Stupid!

20:20.958 --> 20:22.786
Right, this is...
I don't...

20:22.830 --> 20:24.701
...stupid.
Oh, man.

20:27.095 --> 20:30.403
All three of them
took a hit in the back.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.839
They were ambushed.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.537
Sam.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.757
Yeah?I only found two
of the walkies.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.062
One of them's missing.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.285
Hey, guys,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.418
so the helo's en route
to evac the bodies

20:45.461 --> 20:47.202
and we're attaching
Marine fire teams

20:47.246 --> 20:48.595
to all search parties.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.162
Wait, why are you calling me
on a sat phone?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.164
Nell, a walkie was taken
from one of the bodies.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.862
We have to stay off
open airwaves.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.298
Sat phones only.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.039
NELL: That is going to slow down
the search process.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.649
Small price to pay.
We can't risk it.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.695
All right, I will alert the
colonel. Wait, before you go,

21:01.738 --> 21:03.087
the search party you found
was looking for

21:03.131 --> 21:04.654
a large piece of debris
that landed

21:04.698 --> 21:06.482
just east of your
current location.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.092
If the killers were after
their payload,

21:08.136 --> 21:10.094
there's a good bet
they're headed there now.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.313
Thanks, Nell.Yup.

21:13.837 --> 21:18.059
Can never just go for a nice
walk in the woods, can we?

21:20.409 --> 21:21.932
DEEKS:
You know, I've been thinking.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.760
Now would be a good time for
zeppelins to make a comeback.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.196
You mean blimps?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.459
Uh, how dare you?

21:26.502 --> 21:27.982
A blimp is just
a floating billboard.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.288
I'm talking
about a dirigible.

21:29.331 --> 21:32.029
I mean, talk about staterooms
and martini bars,

21:32.073 --> 21:35.772
hot tubs, all while the scenery
is just peacefully floating by.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.340
Oh, I'm so glad you're
still on this slow kick.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.385
Well, slow is the new fast.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.473
Why not do slow travel?

21:40.516 --> 21:42.170
Because we already have that
in L.A.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.171
It's called driving.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.738
DONALD:
Hello?

21:44.781 --> 21:45.869
Can you two keep it down?

21:45.913 --> 21:47.218
I am barely holding it
together here.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.437
All right, Donald.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.309
You need to take a few breaths
and relax.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.919
Okay? We got your back.Relax.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.486
DONALD: I am trying,
but now all I can think about

21:53.529 --> 21:54.791
are blimps, which, by the way,

21:54.835 --> 21:56.837
had their shot and we all know
how that ended.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.186
DEEKS:
Yeah, says the guy whose rocket

21:58.229 --> 21:59.318
just, "Oh, the humanitied"

21:59.361 --> 22:00.406
all over the national forest,
Donald.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.059
KENSI:
Heads up.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.191
I got eyes on Franco.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.279
DEEKS:
You can do this.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.889
Slow and steady.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.021
I contact you,

22:07.064 --> 22:08.022
not the other way around.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.502
Remember, Donny?

22:09.545 --> 22:12.809
I know, but I-I, uh, I need
the other half of my money.

22:12.853 --> 22:13.941
That wasn't the deal.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.203
We still got to
retrieve the payload.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.596
What if I could help you
do that?

22:17.858 --> 22:19.120
There is a, uh,

22:19.163 --> 22:20.339
program on this

22:20.382 --> 22:22.123
that'll open a backdoor
to Proxima's systems

22:22.166 --> 22:24.125
and activate the transponder.
Once you're in,

22:24.168 --> 22:25.561
you can export
the location data...Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.607
Pump the brakes. All right?
I don't know a lot

22:27.650 --> 22:29.086
about this technobabble stuff.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.132
Tell you what.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.048
Come with me,
explain it to him yourself.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.615
Uh, I don't think
that's necessary.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.399
Can't you just take it?

22:37.443 --> 22:38.444
FRANCO:
Well, you see, Donny,

22:38.487 --> 22:40.663
it's his money, not mine.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.578
Franco's armed.

22:42.622 --> 22:46.408
You want to change the deal,
it's him you got to talk to.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.280
KENSI:
Just do what he says, Donald.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.281
Is there a problem?

22:50.325 --> 22:52.936
Donald, say no
or shake your head.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.156
For the love of God,
do something.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.114
Good. VÃ¡monos.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.726
KENSI:
Donald, it's gonna be okay.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
You're gonna have to ditch your
earwig in case they search you,

23:01.641 --> 23:02.642
but do not worry.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.078
The tracker on
the USB is active,

23:04.121 --> 23:07.124
so we got your back
the whole way.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.126
And now we've got no ears.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.389
Well, at least
he's a capable agent

23:10.432 --> 23:11.999
with years of training
to fall back on.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.131
What could
possibly go wrong?

23:19.136 --> 23:23.706
He died a few weeks ago...

23:23.750 --> 23:28.319
after a long battle
with a presumptive condition.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.757
Agent Orange?

23:33.281 --> 23:36.937
I only just
found out yesterday.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.766
Do you remember Nelson?

23:41.811 --> 23:44.510
I barely knew him, Hetty.

23:44.553 --> 23:47.077
It was a lifetime ago.

23:47.121 --> 23:50.472
You have one, too. A grave.

23:50.516 --> 23:54.955
Back in Wyoming
next to your parents.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.174
But that one's empty.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.223
Is it?

24:07.315 --> 24:08.708
You may not

24:08.751 --> 24:11.493
want to die, Keane,

24:11.537 --> 24:13.974
but you don't want to live,
either.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.150
And that's a problem...

24:17.717 --> 24:21.503
...because I owe you a life.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.636
Then let me make it
easy on you, Hetty.

24:23.679 --> 24:27.204
I absolve you of your debt.

24:33.210 --> 24:37.171
But...

24:37.214 --> 24:39.782
doesn't matter if-if
I forgive you, does it,

24:39.826 --> 24:42.176
when you...

24:42.219 --> 24:45.484
can't forgive yourself
for leaving me behind?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.228
It's coming

24:51.272 --> 24:52.882
for us all, Keane.

24:54.449 --> 24:59.062
It's already taken
George and Owen.

24:59.106 --> 25:03.502
Charles is fighting
as best he can.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.417
I need to make this right

25:06.461 --> 25:09.682
with the time I have left.

25:17.254 --> 25:21.084
But I can't do it alone.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.322
He'll be here
soon enough.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.237
You like golf?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.587
Not particularly.

25:45.631 --> 25:46.849
Grab yourself a drink.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.286
All your troubles
will soon be gone.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.071
Yeah, looks like whoever
they're meeting isn't here yet.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.247
We got to find a way
to get ears on them.

25:53.290 --> 25:55.641
Did I get the best idea ever.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.512
Oh, what?

26:04.301 --> 26:05.607
WOMAN:
Is anyone out there?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.391
I repeat. Can anyone hear me?

26:07.435 --> 26:09.393
Nell told everyone to stay
off the radios, right?

26:12.309 --> 26:15.312
Hey, Sam.
Yeah, we can hear it, too.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.314
This is Vanessa Podrasky.
My boyfriend and I

26:17.358 --> 26:18.968
saw the rocket crash last night.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.231
We went out into the woods this
morning to check out the debris

26:21.275 --> 26:22.363
and we found something
that looks important.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.365
See if you can track
the source.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.279
No one respond until...

26:25.322 --> 26:26.454
MAN:
We hear you, Vanessa.

26:26.497 --> 26:27.542
Can you describe what you found?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.717
VANESSA: Oh, thank God.Who is that?

26:28.761 --> 26:29.762
We've been trying
every frequency.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.459
Um, okay.It's no one on our end.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.504
It's a bit damaged
but it's a metal cube

26:33.548 --> 26:35.071
about eight inches
on either side

26:35.115 --> 26:37.378
and it has what looks like
are solar panels on it.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.509
That's the payload.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.642
MAN: Vanessa,
what is your location?

26:40.686 --> 26:42.426
Vanessa, my name is Callen.
I am a federal agent.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.255
For your own safety,
stay off the radio.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.779
Why wouldn't we be safe?

26:46.822 --> 26:48.911
I told you that this thing

26:48.955 --> 26:51.435
is probably radioactive
or something.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.742
MAN:
Vanessa, what's your location?

26:53.786 --> 26:55.265
CALLEN:
Don't answer that, Vanessa.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.745
You could be in danger.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.486
Okay.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.923
Look, don't talk to us
about being in danger.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.446
This thing almost killed us.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.970
Send somebody up here
to come and get it.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.188
We're at a campsiteDamn it.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.408
two miles north of the
Jubilee Trailhead.

27:07.451 --> 27:08.975
MAN: Perfect.
We're ten minutes away.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.629
Who is this? Identify yourself.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.720
MAN:
Sit tight, Vanessa.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.591
We're coming to get you.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.605
Nell, talk us in.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.476
Yeah, so, we've located
the campsite

27:32.520 --> 27:34.043
mentioned over the radio.

27:34.087 --> 27:37.003
It turns out it's just 2.4 miles

27:37.046 --> 27:38.352
east of your current location.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.702
We redirected a search drone
to the area

27:40.746 --> 27:42.617
and it should be overhead soon.Wait, wait, wait.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.793
The voice on the radio said
they were ten minutes away

27:44.837 --> 27:46.142
from the campsite.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.622
There's no way we're gonna
make it before then.

27:47.666 --> 27:52.932
Vanessa, you and your boyfriend
are in serious danger.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.455
The man you were
talking to on the radio

27:54.498 --> 27:55.935
has already killed
three federal agents

27:55.978 --> 27:58.198
and he is headed your way.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.591
They don't know who to trust.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.463
Vanessa, if you can hear me,
you have to trust me.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.552
You need to move right now.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.076
Take your radio and run.Let's go, G.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.034
Double-time.

28:11.646 --> 28:15.084
Oh! Got ahold of that one.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.216
The august crowd,
normally reserved,

28:16.259 --> 28:18.174
goes wild.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.175
You got a nice swing.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.394
Oh, thanks.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.612
You should see me Lindy Hop.

28:21.656 --> 28:22.744
Care for a friendly game?

28:22.788 --> 28:23.745
Maybe put a few dollars on it?

28:23.789 --> 28:25.442
What are you thinking, huh?

28:25.486 --> 28:28.097
A little horseBlue pin.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.577
One shot each.
Closest wins.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.187
Say ten bucks to start.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.015
Well, that, my friend,

28:33.059 --> 28:36.192
is music to my ears.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.454
I'll take another.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.631
KENSI:
I got it from here.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.068
Manager wants to
see you downstairs.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.112
Thanks.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.812
What is taking so long?

28:46.855 --> 28:48.901
Just relax. Be patient.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.467
You're doing fine. Okay

28:50.511 --> 28:52.295
And I'm cutting you off.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.608
Ow. I mean, it's not bad,

29:00.651 --> 29:02.610
but I don't think that's
making it to the dance floor.

29:02.653 --> 29:03.916
Why don't you
watch and learn?

29:03.959 --> 29:05.134
Take some notes.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.832
First off, you got
to have super white pants

29:06.875 --> 29:09.356
and secondly...

29:09.399 --> 29:11.837
you got to get in there.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.926
Can I get you
gentlemen anything?
DEEKS:
It's all in the hips.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.189
Never seen you before. New?

29:16.232 --> 29:18.060
Yeah, I'm new,
but I've been around.
Mm.

29:18.104 --> 29:21.020
Make me a boulevardier. Rye.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.804
It's a bold choice
for a bold man.

29:22.848 --> 29:23.936
I like it.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.244
DEEKS :
I hit so pretty.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.029
Sorry, bud.
Floor is closed.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.074
Oh. What?

29:32.118 --> 29:33.989
No, we're playing a game.
He owes me ten bucks.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.208
I don't know what
he's talking about.

29:35.251 --> 29:37.123
What? Brother,
I got a whole bucket

29:37.166 --> 29:38.864
of balls here.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.170
Come on!

29:41.214 --> 29:43.259
Well, that seemed excessive.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.870
I got a bag.
I got more balls in there.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.655
Seriously?

29:47.698 --> 29:49.222
Those are rentals.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.440
Now.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.573
Ah, this place
is the worst.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.575
You're getting one star.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.056
Not happy.

29:59.667 --> 30:03.497
The only thing you need
to know to work up here

30:03.540 --> 30:07.849
is keep your eyes down and
forget everything you hear.

30:07.893 --> 30:11.244
Just in one pretty ear...

30:13.855 --> 30:15.814
...and out the other.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.120
Understand?

30:18.164 --> 30:19.643
I understand.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.820
Very good. Cheers.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.606
Aah.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.521
And you must be Donald.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.740
Come.

30:29.784 --> 30:32.831
Let's talk.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.314
Yo!

30:38.358 --> 30:40.621
I'm picking up my clubs.
Give me two...

30:40.664 --> 30:42.884
Okay, that was intentional.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.017
MAN:
Get out of the way.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.235
Kensi, I can't get a visual
on this guy.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.106
Can you...

30:47.149 --> 30:48.498
MAN:
Move!

30:48.542 --> 30:49.630
Can you snap a photo

30:49.673 --> 30:52.154
so we can ID him?

30:52.198 --> 30:53.895
What exactly
are you proposing?

30:53.939 --> 30:56.245
I think I can help
you find the payload.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.038
Don't need your help
with that.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.040
My people have
already located it.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.519
They'll have it within an hour.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.392
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'll, uh... just...

31:13.784 --> 31:15.395
Stick around.

31:15.438 --> 31:18.485
We have a deal.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.704
As soon as it's
safely recovered,

31:20.748 --> 31:22.184
you'll get the rest
of your money.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.276
Sajad Khadem.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.712
So he's an
Iranian millionaire?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.410
Yeah, with ties to the
Ministry of Intelligence.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.629
Why would Iran want
this payload so bad?

31:32.673 --> 31:34.370
MOSLEY:
Because it is a next-gen

31:34.414 --> 31:37.852
nanosatellite capable
of unmasking any violation

31:37.896 --> 31:40.463
of the nuclear deal.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.378
I twisted a few arms.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.598
So, if Iran wants to keep
their nuclear program hidden,

31:44.641 --> 31:46.382
they need to keep this satellite
out of the sky.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.949
And recovering it would be
a huge win

31:47.993 --> 31:49.385
for their spy program.

31:49.429 --> 31:52.388
Yeah. Tell Kensi and Deeks
to apprehend Khadem

31:52.432 --> 31:54.216
as soon as Donald is safe.Yes, ma'am.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.483
KHADEM:
Yes, I see.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.922
Good.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.885
Do you know what I like
about golf,

32:10.929 --> 32:12.234
Donald?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.976
It's a game where you can really

32:15.020 --> 32:17.500
take out your frustrations.

32:17.544 --> 32:18.806
Aah!

32:18.849 --> 32:20.939
As long as you don't mind
replacing a few clubs.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.466
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, okay.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.424
Okay, okay.
DEEKS:
Kensi, what's going on?

32:28.468 --> 32:31.688
Seriously?

32:34.256 --> 32:36.780
Oh, please. Oh, please.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.913
I knew you were taken in
by the feds this morning.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.831
Oh, that's not gonna end well.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.834
All right, guys, the drone
is online and moving over

32:46.877 --> 32:48.792
your current position now.Copy that.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.011
Whoa.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.839
Guys, wait.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.972
There is someone moving...

32:54.015 --> 32:55.799
What was that

32:55.843 --> 32:58.324
Callen, Sam, do you copy?

32:58.367 --> 33:00.891
Oh, my... Are you kidding me?

33:00.935 --> 33:03.068
Can you please
get the power up now?

33:03.111 --> 33:04.939
Nell.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.811
Lost her.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.257
Vanessa

33:18.300 --> 33:22.391
Agent Callen, NCIS.
I'm the one you were talking to.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.610
This is Agent Hanna.Oh, my God.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.525
I'm glad to see you.
I did what you said.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.266
I stuffed the thing
in my bag and ran.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.050
What about your boyfriend?

33:29.094 --> 33:31.879
I couldn't convince him
to leave the campsite.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.276
Are there really
dangerous people out here?

33:37.319 --> 33:38.451
BOYFRIEND :
Vanessa?

33:38.494 --> 33:39.843
Are you there?

33:39.887 --> 33:41.367
That's Dave.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.977
MAN:
Vanessa, we have your boyfriend.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.067
Return the satellite to your
tent in the next ten minutes,

33:46.111 --> 33:47.764
or he is dead.

34:03.215 --> 34:06.087
You are going to tell me

34:06.131 --> 34:08.220
everything you told them.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.398
Now would be a good time
to take your break.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.661
Yeah, of course. Um, hey,
let me just, um, grab my...

34:15.705 --> 34:17.272
Federal agent.

34:22.712 --> 34:23.757
DEEKS:
Kens?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.019
Deeks, Khadem and Franco
are running.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.064
On it!

34:29.937 --> 34:31.156
Help!

34:31.199 --> 34:32.418
Hang on, Donald.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.380
Get down! LAPD. Get down.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.382
LAPD. Don't do it.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.517
Ow! Really?

34:44.560 --> 34:45.822
You're gonna swing
a golf club?

34:45.866 --> 34:48.390
Okay, we're doing this, huh?
You just want to...

34:57.356 --> 34:58.966
Really glad we ironed this out.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.620
Oh, wait.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.664
It's a three wood.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.015
Easy.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.669
Please, don't
let me go.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.802
Donald, do you trust me?I don't want to die!

35:08.845 --> 35:10.673
You're not gonna die.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.588
Don't let go of me.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.332
See, you're okay.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.768
You dropped me.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.292
Yup.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.946
I regret everything.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.836
I did what you said.
Where's Dave?

35:46.883 --> 35:47.884
Drop the bag.

35:49.712 --> 35:50.713
Back away.

36:05.511 --> 36:07.252
Duck!

36:07.295 --> 36:08.949
Drop it!

36:14.781 --> 36:15.956
Are you okay?

36:15.999 --> 36:18.872
What about any of this
is okay, Vanessa?

36:18.915 --> 36:21.222
This is why
I hate camping.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.458
Want to get to know someone?
Take 'em camping.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.940
We've never been camping.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.507
Why do you think
we're still together?

36:45.551 --> 36:48.989
Mm. Eric ID'd the strike team.
They were all mercenaries.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.774
No connections to Iran.
Khadem still isn't talking.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.950
Something still isn't adding up.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.959
How did Khadem know that Donald
had been taken into custody?

37:03.003 --> 37:05.048
And for that matter, how did
the Iranians even learn

37:05.092 --> 37:07.442
about the satellite
in the first place?
Yeah.

37:07.486 --> 37:10.271
Welcome back, and let me be the
first, and probably only one,

37:10.315 --> 37:12.491
to tell you,
great job out there.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.709
Thanks.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.276
LAWSON:
Well, look at that.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.974
He didn't need to know what
it was to find it after all.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.454
Oh, you mean the nanosatellite

37:19.498 --> 37:20.977
that was gonna keep an eye
on Iran's nuclear program?

37:21.021 --> 37:23.110
CALLEN: Don't worry,
your secret's safe with us.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.853
I would recommend that you do
an internal investigation ASAP.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.420
What exactly
are you insinuating?

37:28.463 --> 37:30.596
Everyone in my organization
has been thoroughly vetted.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.511
NELL :
Hey, guys, you there?

37:32.554 --> 37:33.860
SAM:
Go ahead, Nell. Where are you?

37:33.903 --> 37:36.906
I'm just out back,
trying to get the power up,

37:36.950 --> 37:40.649
and, look, the outage
definitely wasn't a glitch.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.304
The line was deliberately cut,

37:43.348 --> 37:44.697
by some sort of a...

37:44.740 --> 37:45.872
Bomb.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.526
Wouldn't you have heard a bomb?

37:47.569 --> 37:49.397
No, no, no, no, no, there's
a bomb out here right now.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.746
Clear everyone out of there.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.926
Go, go, go. Let's go. Go! Move!

37:56.970 --> 37:58.798
Gates, let's go. Gates!
Leave it. What are you doing?

37:58.841 --> 37:59.799
Let's go.

37:59.842 --> 38:00.800
Gates!

38:06.849 --> 38:10.375
Callen, Sam, do you copy?

38:15.249 --> 38:16.990
Callen?

38:17.033 --> 38:18.121
Sam?

38:18.165 --> 38:19.601
CALLEN:
You all right?

38:20.863 --> 38:23.344
Oh, God. Yeah.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.215
Did you guys...
Did you get everybody out?

38:25.259 --> 38:26.869
All good.Okay.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.959
Where's the satellite?
Who's got it?

38:30.003 --> 38:32.005
Gates got it.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.442
Where is she now?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.581
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.365
Go, go, go.

38:50.023 --> 38:51.198
Sorry, Gates.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.679
Circus isn't leaving
town just yet.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.958
So let me see if I follow.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.569
Granger met a woman over there,

39:14.613 --> 39:18.573
she tried to kill him,
and then they had

39:18.617 --> 39:21.489
a daughter together
who ended up working

39:21.533 --> 39:23.926
as a North Korean spy.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.275
Yup.

39:25.319 --> 39:28.714
Good for him.
He needed to lighten up.

39:39.333 --> 39:40.987
I should be getting back.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.816
Keane, Keane, Keane, Keane.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.034
Stay.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.166
Hetty...

39:46.209 --> 39:47.733
CALLEN: It's okay,
Nell, I'm not angry.

39:47.776 --> 39:48.951
I'm just saying that when you're

39:48.995 --> 39:51.693
driving on a road trip,
you are the dad.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.043
And the dad is responsible
for calling out the rest stops.

39:54.087 --> 39:54.957
Am I right?
He's right.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.132
Everybody knows that.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.786
Uh-huh.I mean, guys, I'm sorry,

39:57.830 --> 39:59.919
I just, I don't know
how it happened.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.834
Callen, you know, uh,

40:01.877 --> 40:04.619
I apologize profusely.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.316
You did that on purpose,
didn't you

40:06.360 --> 40:10.538
Revenge is a dish best served
to someone with a full bladder?

40:10.582 --> 40:12.497
I'm gonna grab Beale

40:12.540 --> 40:16.414
and Hidoko
and I'll meet you there.

40:20.113 --> 40:23.943
Well, you two look like
you've had a successful day.

40:23.986 --> 40:25.466
SAM:
Harris.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.599
It's good to see you again.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.252
How you feeling?

40:29.296 --> 40:32.604
Better. The docs
patched me up good.

40:32.647 --> 40:35.824
Uh, we're sorry about Nelson.Yeah.

40:35.868 --> 40:38.000
Hetty told us
yesterday.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.349
He seemed like
a good guy.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.440
Yeah, yeah, he was.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.094
SAM:
So, uh...

40:45.138 --> 40:46.531
we're gonna go grab a drink.
You want to join us?

40:46.574 --> 40:47.532
Uh...

40:47.575 --> 40:49.011
First round's on me.

40:49.055 --> 40:50.360
KENSI: Thought you'd
want to curl up

40:50.404 --> 40:51.927
with another
thrilling installment

40:51.971 --> 40:53.189
of Boat in a Fjord?

40:53.233 --> 40:55.888
It's actually called Hellemofjorden Ferje.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.890
Ah, sorry.But a cocktail

40:57.933 --> 40:59.021
with my fiancÃ©e
and my friends,

40:59.065 --> 41:00.109
just what the doctor
ordered for tonight.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.284
What do you think?

41:01.328 --> 41:05.375
Uh, thanks. Maybe another time.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.117
Hetty?
HETTY:
I think I'll

41:08.161 --> 41:09.684
see you all in the morning.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.164
KENSI:
See you tomorrow.

41:11.207 --> 41:12.034
Good night.
Bye, Keane.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.471
Good night.

41:17.126 --> 41:18.301
It's so good

41:18.345 --> 41:20.042
to see them happy.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.567
They've had a rough
couple of years...

41:26.135 --> 41:29.138
...but they look out
for each other.
