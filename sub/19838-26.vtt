00:01.670 --> 00:03.850
<b><i>Given his personality,</i></b>

00:03.850 --> 00:07.000
<b><i>he's probably already warmed 
to these opponents...</i></b>

00:08.080 --> 00:10.110
<b><i>I doubt he'd sell me out,</i></b>

00:10.350 --> 00:14.520
<b><i>but it's probable that he'll accidentally 
say something he shouldn't.</i></b>

00:15.440 --> 00:18.740
<b><i>My chance will come after they leave.</i></b>

00:20.310 --> 00:23.210
<b>I will defeat them...</b>

01:43.990 --> 01:49.000
<b>Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness</b>

02:08.270 --> 02:11.110
<b>The man targeting Gon and Killua</b>

02:12.060 --> 02:14.470
<b>is named Shoot McMahon.</b>

02:14.990 --> 02:18.400
<b>He, too, is one of Morel's students.</b>

02:21.690 --> 02:22.490
<b>This won't work.</b>

02:23.700 --> 02:27.210
<b>In our current condition, 
we don't stand a chance...</b>

02:28.160 --> 02:29.270
<b>Yeah.</b>

02:29.270 --> 02:34.690
<b>I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using 
less than half of his strength.</b>

02:35.350 --> 02:36.630
<b>Probably so.</b>

02:37.240 --> 02:40.430
<b>But we have to fight him.</b>

02:40.430 --> 02:41.470
<b>Yeah...</b>

02:42.550 --> 02:45.000
<b><i>I don't sense anyone else around.</i></b>

02:45.000 --> 02:46.390
<b><i>It's the perfect chance.</i></b>

02:47.980 --> 02:51.900
<b><i>When I take my target down, I am 
always deliberate and thorough.</i></b>

02:52.810 --> 02:55.330
<b><i>That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.</i></b>

03:10.670 --> 03:12.970
<b><i>Here we go... This is my chance.</i></b>

03:14.420 --> 03:16.180
<b><i>What's wrong?</i></b>

03:16.180 --> 03:18.190
<b><i>It's the perfect opportunity.</i></b>

03:18.190 --> 03:19.670
<b><i>Right now, I can easily...</i></b>

03:25.670 --> 03:26.560
<b><i>Go...</i></b>

03:29.100 --> 03:30.050
<b><i>Go!</i></b>

03:46.880 --> 03:48.620
<b>Shoot McMahon...</b>

03:50.100 --> 03:52.900
<b>He is a coward.</b>

03:59.280 --> 04:00.950
<b>Hey, Killua...</b>

04:00.950 --> 04:03.220
<b>Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?</b>

04:03.220 --> 04:05.010
<b>Hmm? What do you mean?</b>

04:05.010 --> 04:07.160
<b>Why didn't they let him go to NGL?</b>

04:07.160 --> 04:09.480
<b>He seems really strong to me.</b>

04:09.800 --> 04:11.100
<b>Well, that's true.</b>

04:11.630 --> 04:16.710
<b>In terms of physical ability, 
he'd be a match for Kite.</b>

04:16.710 --> 04:18.360
<b>It's probably a mental thing.</b>

04:18.710 --> 04:20.020
<b>Mental?</b>

04:20.530 --> 04:24.550
<b>His approach isn't in line 
with this mission's objective.</b>

04:24.550 --> 04:25.490
<b>He's too soft.</b>

04:26.440 --> 04:29.290
<b>And he gets attached to animals too easily.</b>

04:29.630 --> 04:33.750
<b>And he did end up volunteering 
to help us, somehow...</b>

04:34.970 --> 04:38.130
<b>And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.</b>

04:38.130 --> 04:39.110
<b>Yeah...</b>

04:45.290 --> 04:49.850
<b><i>They can maintain their</i> Ren <i>for two hours 
without having to really concentrate.</i></b>

04:49.850 --> 04:51.980
<b><i>That's a good sign...</i></b>

04:51.980 --> 04:54.420
<b><i>If they can do it for three hours,</i></b>

04:54.420 --> 04:57.690
<b><i>I might consider letting them fight 
Knuckle when they're fully rested.</i></b>

04:59.190 --> 05:03.690
<b><i>Knuckle will then be forced 
to use his full strength.</i></b>

05:04.390 --> 05:06.970
<b><i>I hope it will be enough to teach them...</i></b>

05:07.700 --> 05:10.950
<b><i>That which they lack, that which they need.</i></b>

05:11.700 --> 05:14.200
<b><i>But that still only takes them halfway.</i></b>

05:14.200 --> 05:19.300
<b><i>If everything goes well, it'll take them 
about ten days to reach that point.</i></b>

05:20.240 --> 05:25.130
<b><i>And that means they'll have no more 
than a day left before time's up...</i></b>

05:25.130 --> 05:27.120
<b><i>I'm not sure they can make it.</i></b>

05:51.370 --> 05:54.480
<b><i>I should probably prepare for my escape...</i></b>

05:54.480 --> 05:56.160
<b><i>Save my own skin.</i></b>

05:59.430 --> 06:01.150
<b>Help yourself.</b>

06:01.150 --> 06:02.880
<b>Thanks!</b>

06:07.460 --> 06:08.370
<b>Yum!</b>

06:09.470 --> 06:10.640
<b>What do you think?</b>

06:11.030 --> 06:13.730
<b>Oh, this is really good!</b>

06:13.730 --> 06:15.430
<b>Not that!</b>

06:15.430 --> 06:17.120
<b>We only have ten days.</b>

06:17.120 --> 06:17.640
<b>Huh?</b>

06:17.920 --> 06:19.390
<b>From what I've seen,</b>

06:19.390 --> 06:22.050
<b>you're only two-thirds through your training</b>

06:22.050 --> 06:24.850
<b>to become strong enough</b>

06:24.850 --> 06:28.530
<b>to force Knuckle into using his full strength...</b>

06:29.110 --> 06:30.430
<b><i>Uh-oh...</i></b>

06:30.430 --> 06:32.530
<b><i>She knows exactly what's going on.</i></b>

06:32.530 --> 06:34.790
<b>Huh? Is that true, Bisky?</b>

06:37.760 --> 06:39.340
<b>But it'll be fine!</b>

06:39.340 --> 06:42.020
<b>We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!</b>

06:43.420 --> 06:45.800
<b>How can you be so sure?!</b>

06:46.130 --> 06:49.300
<b>The situation hasn't improved at all...</b>

06:51.760 --> 06:56.770
<b>You said it was all right for 
me to speak up, so I will.</b>

06:56.770 --> 06:59.690
<b>You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!</b>

06:59.690 --> 07:02.070
<b>They didn't give you enough time...</b>

07:02.070 --> 07:05.240
<b>Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,</b>

07:05.240 --> 07:08.610
<b>staring at it to calm myself.</b>

07:08.610 --> 07:11.520
<b>That means I'm nearly over the edge,</b>

07:11.520 --> 07:16.290
<b>so if you run at once, before it's too late, 
I probably won't try to chase and kill you.</b>

07:17.090 --> 07:18.640
<b><i>If not for her outbursts...</i></b>

07:18.640 --> 07:22.290
<b><i>This would be a pleasant meal...</i></b>

07:22.690 --> 07:24.410
<b>We aren't gonna run away.</b>

07:24.410 --> 07:25.790
<b>How many times do I have to say it?</b>

07:26.470 --> 07:28.960
<b>What else can you do?</b>

07:28.960 --> 07:32.430
<b>As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!</b>

07:33.510 --> 07:34.550
<b>We'll win!</b>

07:35.300 --> 07:36.310
<b>Pinky swear.</b>

07:37.600 --> 07:39.480
<b>Come on... Hurry up!</b>

07:40.950 --> 07:47.190
<b>I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle 
and Shoot before the deadline.</b>

07:47.610 --> 07:52.010
<b>If I break my promise, I have to 
swallow a thousand needles...</b>

07:52.010 --> 07:53.740
<b>Pinky sworn!</b>

07:55.280 --> 07:57.700
<b>On the island I'm from, there's another part.</b>

07:58.220 --> 08:01.190
<b>You go like this and put your thumbs together.</b>

08:02.090 --> 08:04.580
<b>Sealed with a kiss!</b>

08:06.950 --> 08:08.980
<b>Okay, now it's a promise.</b>

08:09.560 --> 08:12.950
<b>By the way, Palm-san, 
what did you use to flavor this?</b>

08:12.950 --> 08:16.600
<b>Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones...</b>

08:17.300 --> 08:22.010
<b>Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.</b>

08:23.460 --> 08:28.230
<b>I suspect she's the one leading 
things in that direction...</b>

08:28.370 --> 08:32.110
<b>I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,</b>

08:32.110 --> 08:34.290
<b>then I let it sit for another night.</b>

08:34.800 --> 08:36.740
<b>Ten days left.</b>

08:37.120 --> 08:39.150
<b>Don't say that like a countdown to our death!</b>

08:54.940 --> 08:56.010
<b>This is it...</b>

08:57.880 --> 09:00.900
<b>Smoke that covers the forest like fog.</b>

09:02.930 --> 09:04.450
<b>Baital squad here.</b>

09:04.450 --> 09:06.270
<b>Goran, give me an update.</b>

09:07.720 --> 09:09.490
<b>Goran, do you read me?</b>

09:09.900 --> 09:10.770
<b>Goran!</b>

09:11.400 --> 09:14.470
<b><i>Could they have already taken him out?</i></b>

09:15.270 --> 09:17.330
<b>Anyone from Goran's squad out there?</b>

09:17.330 --> 09:19.350
<b>Give me a report!</b>

09:19.350 --> 09:20.250
<b>Hey...</b>

09:20.250 --> 09:23.900
<b>We can't see anything with all this smoke...</b>

09:23.900 --> 09:27.060
<b>We've been trying to reach Squadron 
Leader Goran, but he won't respond!</b>

09:24.290 --> 09:26.110
<b>Any sign of the leader?</b>

09:26.110 --> 09:28.970
<b>I can't see the guy in front 
of me! What's going on?!</b>

09:27.060 --> 09:28.970
<b>I've lost contact with him!</b>

09:28.970 --> 09:30.940
<b>He was right beside me a moment ago!</b>

09:29.640 --> 09:31.650
<b>I can't see a thing!</b>

09:30.940 --> 09:33.140
<b>He just vanished into the smoke!</b>

09:31.650 --> 09:34.500
<b>Yah! There's a hole!</b>

09:36.710 --> 09:39.510
<b><i>With all these messages, 
I can't tell what's happening...</i></b>

09:39.510 --> 09:43.430
<b><i>They should've established a communication 
network to operate in the leader's absence.</i></b>

09:44.360 --> 09:46.010
<b>Baital squad, forward!</b>

09:46.470 --> 09:48.690
<b>Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.</b>

09:50.480 --> 09:54.810
<b>Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act 
as rearguard for the Baital squad!</b>

09:56.310 --> 09:58.520
<b>Proceed in a V formation!</b>

10:11.700 --> 10:14.810
<b><i>The number of soldiers is dropping.</i></b>

10:16.430 --> 10:19.030
<b><i>What's happening?</i></b>

10:20.750 --> 10:21.720
<b>Now.</b>

10:24.940 --> 10:26.590
<b>Hey, Baital?</b>

10:41.430 --> 10:43.870
<b>So you're next?</b>

10:53.060 --> 10:55.770
<b>Are you sure this is a good idea?</b>

10:56.280 --> 10:57.380
<b>What do you mean?</b>

10:58.190 --> 11:00.480
<b>All we do is send enemies to the old man.</b>

11:00.480 --> 11:02.440
<b>He's the one who takes them out.</b>

11:02.980 --> 11:05.430
<b>This is a little too easy.</b>

11:05.430 --> 11:07.390
<b>But it is a surefire method.</b>

11:07.810 --> 11:08.890
<b>Can't argue there.</b>

11:09.740 --> 11:11.650
<b>The Chairman was being modest...</b>

11:11.650 --> 11:14.530
<b>He's still much stronger than we are.</b>

11:15.050 --> 11:17.350
<b>And he seems rather excited about this.</b>

11:20.450 --> 11:22.910
<b>Oh, speak of the devil.</b>

11:25.370 --> 11:27.780
<b>Keep sending them my way.</b>

11:28.230 --> 11:31.030
<b>I'm finally starting to regain my touch.</b>

11:31.940 --> 11:33.790
<b>Impressive...</b>

11:36.080 --> 11:38.120
<b>And how about the Queen?</b>

11:38.820 --> 11:41.050
<b>She hasn't made a move.</b>

11:41.740 --> 11:44.680
<b>The Queen is still holed up in her nest.</b>

11:45.600 --> 11:49.680
<b>Then the King hasn't been born yet.</b>

11:50.680 --> 11:54.190
<b>Continue to monitor the situation.</b>

11:54.600 --> 11:56.030
<b>Roger that.</b>

11:56.820 --> 11:59.550
<b>The old man's on a roll.</b>

11:59.550 --> 12:01.890
<b>Shall we grab another squadron?</b>

12:01.890 --> 12:02.870
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:10.610 --> 12:13.460
<b>Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.</b>

12:14.150 --> 12:16.330
<b>We're down to fourteen squadrons.</b>

12:17.190 --> 12:18.820
<b>Damned humans.</b>

12:18.820 --> 12:22.500
<b>How are they managing to whittle us down?</b>

12:22.920 --> 12:24.240
<b>I don't know.</b>

12:24.240 --> 12:29.310
<b>All I know is that there are some 
humans who are very strong.</b>

12:30.770 --> 12:34.420
<b>We know too little about humans.</b>

12:34.970 --> 12:39.230
<b>They appear to possess a variety 
of powers far stronger than ours.</b>

12:39.690 --> 12:44.240
<b>Had we more time, we could 
obtain that power, as well.</b>

12:45.550 --> 12:49.080
<b>However, once the King is born, 
we will hold the advantage.</b>

12:49.080 --> 12:51.500
<b>Yes, I hope that will be the case.</b>

13:03.550 --> 13:05.360
<b>You want to come out?</b>

13:08.340 --> 13:09.810
<b>Not yet.</b>

13:11.160 --> 13:13.480
<b>It's still too early.</b>

13:19.290 --> 13:21.070
<b>Okay, that's three hours!</b>

13:21.600 --> 13:23.710
<b>Oh? Already?</b>

13:23.710 --> 13:25.890
<b>That seemed fast.</b>

13:25.890 --> 13:28.700
<b>Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.</b>

13:28.700 --> 13:29.840
<b>Huh?</b>

13:29.840 --> 13:31.450
<b>Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?</b>

13:32.290 --> 13:35.170
<b>You can go once you're rested.</b>

13:35.910 --> 13:36.830
<b>Defeat him.</b>

13:38.680 --> 13:42.590
<b>You have a little over a day 
before the Chairman's deadline.</b>

13:43.290 --> 13:45.720
<b>This may be your first and last chance.</b>

13:49.590 --> 13:55.350
<b><i>Well, if they're able to fight at full strength, 
they'll have to accept the results, win or lose.</i></b>

13:55.820 --> 13:58.360
<b><i>If they can each identify what they're missing,</i></b>

13:58.360 --> 14:01.140
<b><i>then this training was a success.</i></b>

14:18.200 --> 14:21.390
<b><i>Now, the problem is figuring out my escape...</i></b>

14:54.830 --> 14:56.910
<b>Seems you kids are serious tonight.</b>

16:40.790 --> 16:42.770
<b>Morning, Youpi.</b>

16:47.010 --> 16:48.270
<b>Youpi?</b>

16:49.030 --> 16:54.030
<b>To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi.</b>

16:56.600 --> 16:58.630
<b>I'm hungry.</b>

17:05.410 --> 17:09.040
<b>Before we begin, I want to 
know where your partner is.</b>

17:09.500 --> 17:12.060
<b>Eh? You mean Shoot?</b>

17:12.060 --> 17:12.950
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:13.350 --> 17:15.680
<b>Why do you want to know that?</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:18.180
<b>You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.</b>

17:18.880 --> 17:21.270
<b>We need both tokens.</b>

17:21.270 --> 17:23.450
<b>That's a riot!</b>

17:23.450 --> 17:26.060
<b>If you defeat me, I'll tell you.</b>

17:26.810 --> 17:28.740
<b>We might not get a chance to ask you then.</b>

17:29.130 --> 17:30.820
<b>You might be out cold.</b>

17:35.360 --> 17:38.070
<b>You're no longer amusing me...</b>

17:58.570 --> 17:59.600
<b>There!</b>

18:02.150 --> 18:02.850
<b>Gon!</b>

18:06.390 --> 18:07.760
<b><i>That hit hard.</i></b>

18:07.760 --> 18:10.260
<b><i>I could feel the impact 
throughout my entire body.</i></b>

18:10.750 --> 18:14.660
<b><i>If I drop my</i> Ken, <i>his next 
punch will knock me out.</i></b>

18:15.470 --> 18:18.000
<b>After another four or five warm-up punches,</b>

18:18.000 --> 18:19.660
<b>I'll get serious...</b>

18:19.660 --> 18:22.080
<b>Better watch yourself.</b>

18:23.500 --> 18:25.830
<b>I warm up fast.</b>

18:29.570 --> 18:31.860
<b>Still no one coming out today?</b>

18:31.860 --> 18:32.880
<b>No.</b>

18:35.040 --> 18:38.510
<b>As expected, they've holed up inside.</b>

18:39.260 --> 18:40.890
<b>Shall we make our move?</b>

18:41.610 --> 18:45.190
<b>No, we're approaching the 
deadline for your disciples.</b>

18:45.930 --> 18:47.640
<b>We can wait until that's over.</b>

18:48.400 --> 18:52.910
<b>Judging by the estimated number of 
bodies currently stored in the nest,</b>

18:52.910 --> 18:56.300
<b>they'll need to replenish in a week or so.</b>

18:56.920 --> 18:59.150
<b>I would like to dispatch another</b>

18:59.150 --> 19:01.540
<b>two or three squadrons at that time.</b>

19:02.300 --> 19:04.270
<b>Okay, I'll leave it in your hands.</b>

19:10.490 --> 19:13.740
<b>We don't move until we know 
how our disciples performed.</b>

19:15.630 --> 19:17.170
<b>I think it's a waste of time...</b>

19:18.170 --> 19:20.380
<b>Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,</b>

19:20.380 --> 19:23.990
<b>but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable.</b>

19:24.540 --> 19:27.050
<b>We can't count on them for anything in a fight.</b>

19:27.050 --> 19:30.190
<b>At best, they could act as decoys.</b>

19:31.180 --> 19:33.740
<b>Hell, they'd probably get in our way...</b>

19:34.180 --> 19:36.470
<b>I'm certain of it.</b>

19:36.860 --> 19:40.570
<b>That old man always was a gambler...</b>

19:41.300 --> 19:45.500
<b>Want to bet whose disciples 
will show up tomorrow?</b>

19:46.790 --> 19:50.030
<b>I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot.</b>

19:50.580 --> 19:53.580
<b>If we're both wrong, 
the Chairman gets the money.</b>

19:54.820 --> 19:55.840
<b>How about it?</b>

19:57.460 --> 19:58.800
<b>Sure.</b>

19:59.480 --> 20:01.090
<b>Then, I'll put...</b>

20:04.080 --> 20:05.590
<b>...1,000,000 on them.</b>

20:05.590 --> 20:09.700
<b>Huh? That's just impossible!</b>

20:09.700 --> 20:12.540
<b>Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?</b>

20:13.060 --> 20:14.860
<b>The Chairman is a dog?</b>

20:16.180 --> 20:18.360
<b>I happen to love gambling.</b>

20:18.850 --> 20:21.530
<b>I always roll high...</b>

20:29.370 --> 20:30.370
<b>There!</b>

20:32.470 --> 20:33.960
<b>Behind you, fool!</b>

20:51.240 --> 20:52.950
<b><i>He's still warming up?</i></b>

20:53.320 --> 20:55.270
<b><i>Damn, he's strong!</i></b>

20:55.720 --> 20:57.450
<b><i>But why is Knuckle...</i></b>

20:57.950 --> 20:58.950
<b><i>Could it be...</i></b>

20:58.950 --> 21:03.760
<b>Hey, aren't you going to use 
that "First comes rock" thing?</b>

21:04.820 --> 21:07.510
<b>Well, you won't be able to use that technique.</b>

21:07.510 --> 21:10.130
<b>It's flawed, after all.</b>

21:11.530 --> 21:13.040
<b><i>It's flawed?</i></b>

21:13.640 --> 21:15.260
<b>A word of advice...</b>

21:15.260 --> 21:18.920
<b>If you try that technique, 
I'll stop you in your tracks.</b>

21:22.310 --> 21:25.810
<b>In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it.</b>

21:29.280 --> 21:31.270
<b>Your technique</b>

21:31.270 --> 21:34.510
<b>has two huge weaknesses!</b>

21:49.190 --> 21:52.670
<b><i>I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission</i></b>

21:53.560 --> 21:56.960
<b><i>without sacrificing someone...</i></b>

23:26.040 --> 23:28.500
<b>Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.</b>

23:28.500 --> 23:30.630
<b>And love and sorrow!</b>

23:30.630 --> 23:32.900
<b>And reassurance...</b>

23:32.900 --> 23:34.260
<b>No biggie!</b>
